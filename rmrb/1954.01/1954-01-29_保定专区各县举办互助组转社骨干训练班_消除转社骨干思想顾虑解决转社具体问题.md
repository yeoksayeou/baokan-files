Baoding Prefecture Each County Held Mutual Aid Group to Cooperative Transformation Backbone Training Classes
Eliminating Ideological Concerns of Transformation Backbone and Solving Specific Problems of Transformation

    Recently, various counties in Baoding Prefecture, Hebei Province, have been holding agricultural production cooperative backbone training classes in a planned manner, which has achieved significant results.
    The people studying in the training classes are mainly mutual aid group leaders and activists who are requesting to transform into cooperatives; in addition, full-time and part-time mutual aid and cooperation cadres in each district, township cadres with cooperative establishment tasks, and old cooperative chairmen are also absorbed to participate. The main content of the training is the Party's general line and mutual aid and cooperation guidelines and policies during the transition period, as well as the methods and specific steps for establishing cooperatives.
    In the early stage of training, each county universally discovered the following ideological situations among the trainees: Mutual aid groups with better conditions, before understanding the conditions and purpose of running a cooperative, always thought that their group's conditions were not good enough to transform into a cooperative, while a small number of groups believed that their mutual aid group was doing well and were unwilling to transform into a cooperative; leaders of mutual aid groups with poor conditions and some township cadres who had not led a cooperative felt reluctant to participate in the training class, believing that transforming into a cooperative had little to do with them; in addition, mutual aid group leaders who were village cadres were afraid that they would not run the cooperative well after its establishment and would lose prestige in front of the masses, holding a negative idea of taking it slow like an old ox pulling a cart. Some district and township cadres also one-sidedly emphasized that they had no experience in running cooperatives and held the idea of preferring fewer cooperatives to more in developing cooperatives. In response to the above ideological situations, the training class, in addition to carrying out education on the principles and policies of running cooperatives and mobilizing old cooperative chairmen to introduce their experiences, mainly improved their ideological understanding through education on the general line. For example, Liu Guicai of Gu Xian Village in Wangdu County said after studying the general line: "In the past, I thought it wouldn't be too late for me to join after others had joined the cooperative. This time, my thinking has broadened, and I will take the lead in running cooperatives when I go back." Of the twenty-four mutual aid group leaders participating in the training in Tang County, seventeen groups requested to transform into cooperatives at that time, and seven groups expressed that they would actively create conditions for transforming into cooperatives after returning to the village. After studying, the district and township cadres also corrected their leadership attitude and reversed the dependent thinking of "the township relies on the district" and "the district relies on the county."
    With the solution of ideological problems, the trainees urgently demanded to solve the problem of how to establish a cooperative. Each training class also explained the cooperative's constitution, and the local better old cooperative chairmen introduced their experience in running cooperatives, solving many specific problems through the education of living people and real events. After Chang Beinü, the old cooperative chairman of Gaoyang County, introduced her experience, many people "knew the steps to establish a cooperative." District and township cadres also felt that they had rich leadership capital. For example, Yan Xiang, secretary of the Second District Party Committee, said: "In the past, there was no way to do the work of establishing cooperatives. Now that I have learned the experience of establishing cooperatives, I have the capital to lead the establishment of cooperatives." During the entire training period in Dingxing County, old cooperative chairman Wang Dekui was invited to give two reports on how to invest land and how to combine agriculture and sideline occupations. The trainees unanimously reflected: "This solves problems better than just talking about principles in class."
    Each training class adopted the method of closely coordinating lectures, group discussions, and the introduction of typical experiences, so that everyone could fully understand the principles and policies of running cooperatives and various specific problems. During group discussions in the Wan County training class, the old cooperative chairman organized a tutoring group, so the discussion was in-depth and everyone was in high spirits. At the end of the training in each county's training class, the trainees generally understood the policy of mutual aid and cooperation and the method of establishing cooperatives, and 344 mutual aid group leaders actively requested approval to transform into cooperatives.
    At the end of the training classes in each county of the prefecture, two problems were discovered: one was that the scope of selecting trainees for the training class was too narrow, and many mutual aid groups requesting to transform into cooperatives had not yet had anyone participate. Most of those who were trained this time were groups that were usually grasped by the higher levels. If other mutual aid group leaders who requested to transform into cooperatives could be gathered together to study, it would be more effective. In addition, at the end of the training, a few cadres developed a tendency to take the work of establishing cooperatives too easily. For example, some township cadres did not know the specific situation of the masses in the township and put forward the requirement to establish many cooperatives, while others said: "Regardless of the conditions, it's always no good if we don't dare to do it. Once we do it, it will definitely succeed." The training classes also corrected this hasty and rash tendency in a timely manner. (Jin Zhenjia)

　　保定专区各县举办互助组转社骨干训练班
　　消除转社骨干思想顾虑解决转社具体问题
    河北省保定专区各县，最近有计划地举办了农业生产合作社骨干分子训练班，收到显著成效。
    在训练班学习的人，主要是要求转社的互助组长和积极分子；另外，各区专职和兼职的互助合作干部，有建社任务的乡干部和老社社长也被吸收参加。训练的主要内容，是党在过渡时期的总路线和互助合作的方针、政策，以及建社的方法及具体步骤。
    各县在训练初期，普遍发现受训人员有以下几种思想情况：条件较好的互助组，在没有了解办社条件和办社目的以前，总以为本组条件不够，转不了社，少数的组则认为自己的互助组搞得不错，不愿意转社；条件较差的互助组的组长和某些没有领导过社的乡干部，则对于参加训练班很勉强，认为转社和自己的关系不大；此外，互助组长是村干部的，则怕建社后办不好，在群众面前失威信，抱有老牛拉车慢慢来的消极思想，有些区乡干部也片面强调没有办社经验，对发展社抱有宁少勿多的思想。训练班针对以上各种思想情况，除了进行办社方针、政策的教育和动员老社社长介绍经验外，主要的还是通过总路线的教育，使他们提高思想认识。如望都县固现村刘贵才，在学习了总路线后检讨说：“过去我想等别人都入了社我再加入也不晚。这次，我的思想开阔了，回去要带头办社。”唐县参加受训的二十四个互助组长，当时就有十七个组要求转社，有七个组表示回村后积极创造转社条件。区、乡干部在学习以后，也端正了领导态度，扭转了“乡靠区”“区靠县”的依赖思想。
    随着思想问题的解决，受训人员迫切要求解决如何建社的问题。各个训练班又都讲解社章，并由当地较好的老社社长介绍办社经验，通过活人活事的教育，解决了许多具体问题。高阳县训练班经过老社社长常北女介绍经验，使许多人员“知道建社分几步走了。”区、乡干部也感觉有了丰富的领导资本了。如二区区委书记阎祥说：“过去对建社工作没办法，这会学了建社经验，领导建社有本钱了。”定兴县在整个训练期间，请老社社长王德奎作了两次有关土地怎样入股，农业、副业怎样结合等问题的报告，学员一致反映：“这比上课光讲原则解决问题。”
    各训练班采取了讲课、小组讨论和介绍典型经验三者密切配合的办法，使大家对办社的方针政策及各种具体问题，都能充分了解。完县训练班中进行小组讨论时，由老社社长组织辅导小组，所以讨论得深入，大家情绪很高。各县训练班在训练结束时，受训练的人员一般都懂得了互助合作的政策和建社的方法，有三百四十四个互助组长积极要求批准他们转社。
    该专区各县训练班在结束时，发现两个问题：一个是训练班选择受训人员的面太窄了，有不少要求转社的互助组还没有人参加。这次受训练的大半是上级平日所掌握了的组，如能把其他要求转社的互助组长都召集在一起学习，就会收效更大。另外，在训练结束时，有少数干部产生了把建社工作看得太容易的偏向，如有的乡干部还不知道乡里群众具体情况，就提出了建很多社的要求，有的则说：“管他条件不条件呢，老不敢办老不行，一办就许成。”训练班对这种急躁冒进的偏向，也都及时纠正了。　（金振甲）
