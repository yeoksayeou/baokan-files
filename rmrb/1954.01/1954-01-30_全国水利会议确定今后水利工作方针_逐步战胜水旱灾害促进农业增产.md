　　The National Water Conservancy Conference Defines Future Water Conservancy Work Guidelines
　　Gradually Overcome Floods and Droughts to Promote Agricultural Production
    The 1953 National Water Conservancy Conference, convened by the Ministry of Water Conservancy of the Central People's Government, lasted twenty days and successfully concluded on December 31, 1953. Based on the general line of the country during the transition period, the conference proposed the future guidelines for water conservancy construction: starting from serving the country's industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, gradually overcome floods and droughts to promote and ensure increased agricultural production, especially the production of grain and cotton. The conference also proposed five main tasks for the current stage: 1. Prevent the Yellow River and Yangtze River from experiencing serious breaches or changes in course, to prevent disrupting the country's overall construction plans. 2. Continue vigorously harnessing the Huai River to reduce the harm of this disaster-prone river. 3. For general rivers, ensure that dikes do not collapse under the current guaranteed water level. Some severely harmful river courses should be appropriately harnessed to reduce flood and waterlogging disasters in ordinary rainstorms. 4. Carry out various mass-based medium and small-sized farmland water conservancy projects, cultivate the people's ability to resist disasters, and serve agricultural production. 5. Resolve the outstanding issues of completed projects.
    Since liberation, the brilliant achievements of China's water conservancy construction have fully demonstrated the superiority of the people's democratic system. In the past four years, a total of more than 42,000 kilometers of embankments, more than 500 kilometers of sea dikes, and 6,000 kilometers of river channels have been dredged. Three reservoirs have been built, and four reservoirs are about to be completed, along with seven large-scale sluice gates over 100 meters long, twelve medium-sized culvert gates dozens of meters long, and thirteen ship locks, and four hundred and forty-five small culvert gates. A total of 15,371 irrigation projects, large and small, have been built, and more than 210,000 valley control projects have been undertaken in mass-based soil and water conservation work. As of October 1953, according to incomplete statistics, a total of more than 2.68 billion cubic meters of earthwork, more than 17 million cubic meters of stonework, and more than 630,000 cubic meters of concrete work have been completed. This has reduced the water disasters of the Huai River, the Yangtze River, the Yellow River, the Han River, and along the coast, lakes, and general rivers. The lower reaches of the Huai River have basically eliminated the threat of floods like those of 1921. If the dams in the middle reaches can be controlled properly, it can also be guaranteed that the main dike of the Huai River will not be at risk of breaching in the event of floods like those of 1950. Although the floods of the Huai River and Ying River in the upper reaches have not yet been resolved, the floods of the Hongru River have improved; The dikes of the middle and lower reaches of the Yellow River have been continuously repaired and strengthened over the past few years, especially with the adoption of the cone penetration method, eliminating more than 70,000 large and small hidden dangers, strengthening the quality of the dikes; coupled with planned flood storage, detention, and diversion projects, it is possible to strive to defend against floods similar to those of 1933. The dikes of the Yangtze River and Han River have also been strengthened, and the Jingjiang Flood Diversion Project has been built, basically eliminating the threat of breaching the Jingjiang Dike. After the completion of the Guanting Reservoir on the Yongding River, it will be able to control floods above Guanting, reduce downstream floods, and lay the foundation for the development of water conservancy. In the past four years, great achievements have also been made in mass-based farmland water conservancy work, with a total of more than 6 million small ponds and dams built and repaired, more than 250 larger irrigation projects restored and newly built, and more than 30 drainage projects, plus improved irrigation management, expanding the irrigated area by more than 54 million mu.
    In order to better serve the country's general line during the transition period with future water conservancy construction, the conference conducted special research on the following central issues. First, the issue of water conservancy serving the socialist transformation of agriculture. (1) The conference believes that state-owned farms are socialist components, property owned by the whole people, and levers for promoting the socialist transformation of agriculture, and also play an important role in solving the grain problem. Therefore, the water conservancy departments should meet the needs of state-owned farms in water conservancy and actively cooperate with the agricultural departments to put forward water conservancy construction plans for state-owned farms, and provide technical guidance. (2) Water conservancy construction should promote farmers to take the road of collectivization. All projects invested by the state are socialist property in themselves; increasing projects increases socialist components. At the same time, small-scale water conservancy can promote the mutual aid and cooperation movement in rural areas. It is difficult for individual households or even mutual aid groups to build water conservancy. It is easier to form cooperatives. Therefore, water conservancy needs cooperation and collective strength even more. Therefore, water conservancy work needs to rely on cooperatives, help cooperatives, and promote their development. Of course, individual farmers should also be helped equally, without discrimination, to gradually attract them to organize. (3) Focus on pilot projects for pumping stations. These are tools for future agricultural collectivization and mechanization; many places need them, especially in the rice-growing areas of the South, which should be given more attention. In order to develop steadily, pilot projects should be the focus in the next few years, conducting investigations and research to understand the laws of use of pumping stations and study future development plans, so as to gradually develop according to needs and possibilities. (4) Major regions, provinces, prefectures, and counties should study the basic conditions of local water flows, the needs of the masses, and the direction of development according to the overall deployment of higher authorities, especially provinces and counties, to understand the water situation, weigh the priorities, and realistically make comprehensive and long-term water management plans based on objective needs and subjective forces, so that water conservancy construction can fully comply with the requirements of the general line. Second, research was also conducted on doing a good job in water conservancy construction planning and survey and design work, improving the quality of large-scale water conservancy projects, and better completing the 1954 water conservancy construction plan. The conference pointed out that in many large-scale water conservancy projects done in the past, there were relatively serious phenomena of rushing work in surveying, planning, design, and construction, resulting in many projects forming idle work, rework, rushing work, poor project quality, backlog of materials, and huge waste and losses. According to the principle of steady progress in building large-scale water conservancy projects, the conference requires all localities to adhere to the implementation of basic construction procedures; strengthen basic work such as planning and design. Among them, it is particularly emphasized that the design ideas of survey and design personnel must be corrected. Because engineering design is a concrete manifestation of the national plan, it is necessary to proceed from the country's general line, comprehensively consider the political, economic, and technical relationships, and conduct comprehensive comparative research in order to find the most reasonable solution. In order to concentrate the use of survey and design forces, the conference decided to start adjusting the existing survey and design institutions from the Central Ministry of Water Conservancy based on the suggestions of Soviet experts. Major regions and provinces should also appropriately concentrate design forces and strengthen existing survey and design institutions. In addition, it was also decided to carry out river basin planning work for certain rivers in a planned and step-by-step manner, so as to better combine the current interests and long-term interests of the people, the interests of the part and the interests of the whole, so that water conservancy construction meets the needs of national industrialization and agricultural production development, and more accurately serves the country's general line. Third, the conference also studied the strengthening of construction management and engineering management. In the past, construction management was gradually progressing through exploration; many projects were constructed without planning or while designing and constructing. Now, it has been achieved that construction is carried out with technical design. The Dahuo Fang Reservoir project on the Hun River, which officially started construction in early November last year, also prepared a relatively detailed construction organization design before construction. The Fozi Ling Reservoir project, after adjusting the organization and implementing production reforms from June and July last year, has been able to compile operation plans based on quotas and carry out construction according to the plan, and has initially entered the track of planned management. The conference put forward many suggestions for improvement for further strengthening construction management work in the future: for large-scale projects, it is required to do a good job in construction organization design and master operation plans, establish a technical responsibility system and a technical inspection system, and strengthen technical management. For medium and small-scale projects, the planning and technical guidance of construction should be strengthened to ensure project quality. Focusing on and systematically strengthening quota work, gradually accumulating quota data, which is of direct and important significance for improving production, improving technology, saving materials and strengthening construction planning. In addition, it also put forward the strengthening of material and financial management on construction sites and attention to safety and health on construction sites, so that each project strives to achieve "good, economical, fast and safe" requirements. In terms of engineering management, the conference required all localities to conscientiously correct the ideological bias of "emphasizing engineering and neglecting management" existing among cadres. From leading organs to each project, necessary engineering management institutions or full-time personnel must be established to gradually formulate systems and methods for the operation, maintenance, management, testing, recording, and security of each project, and to study and strengthen the maintenance and management of natural river channels and lakes, so as to ensure that each water conservancy facility extends its service life as much as possible and fully exerts its effective benefits for agricultural production, shipping, and urban industrial water use.

　　全国水利会议确定今后水利工作方针
　　逐步战胜水旱灾害促进农业增产
    中央人民政府水利部召开的一九五三年全国水利会议，历时二十天，已在一九五三年十二月三十一日胜利闭幕。会议根据国家在过渡时期的总路线提出今后水利建设的方针：从服务于国家工业化和农业的社会主义改造出发，逐步地战胜水旱灾害，以促进并保证农业的增产，特别是粮食和棉花的增产。会议并提出目前阶段的五项主要任务：一、使黄河、长江不发生严重的决口或改道，以防打乱整个国家的建设部署。二、继续大力治淮，以减轻这条多灾河流的危害。三、对于一般河流，要求在目前保证水位下不溃堤。其中某些为害严重的河道应适当整治，在普通暴雨情况下减轻洪水和内涝灾害。四、开展各种各样的群众性的中、小型农田水利，培养人民的抗灾能力，为农业增产服务。五、解决已完工程的遗留问题。
    解放以来，我国水利建设事业的辉煌成就，充分显示了人民民主制度的优越性。四年来共整修四万二千多公里的堤防，五百多公里的海塘，疏浚了六千公里的河道，建筑了三座水库、即将建成的有四座水库、七座长一百公尺以上的大型水闸、十二座数十公尺长的中型涵闸和十三座船闸、四百四十五座小型涵闸。修建了灌溉工程大小建筑物一万五千三百七十一座，群众性的水土保持工作中的谷坊工程二十一万多座。截至一九五三年十月为止，据不完全统计，共完成土方工程二十六亿八千多万公方，石方工程一千七百多万公方，混凝土工程六十三万多公方。这就使淮河、长江、黄河、汉水和沿海、沿湖以及一般河流的水患减轻。现在淮河下游已基本消除了一九二一年式的洪水威胁，中游如能将闸坝控制得法，亦能保证淮河干堤在一九五零年式的洪水情况下，不致有破堤危险，上游的淮河、颍河洪水虽尚未解决，但洪汝河的洪水已有了改善；黄河中下游的堤防经过几年来不断整修加固，特别是采用了锥探方法，消灭大小隐患七万多处，使堤防质量加强；加上有计划地做了蓄洪、滞洪和分洪等工程，可争取防御和一九三三年同样的洪水。长江、汉水的堤防也有加强，并修筑了荆江分洪工程，基本上解除了荆江大堤决口的威胁。永定河官厅水库修成后，就可控制官厅以上的洪水，减轻了下游水灾，并为开发水利建立了基础。四年来在群众性的农田水利工作上也有巨大成绩，共兴修和整修小型塘坝六百多万处，恢复和新建较大灌溉工程二百五十多处，排水工程三十多处，加上改善了灌溉管理，共扩大灌溉面积五千四百多万亩。
    为使今后的水利建设更好地为国家过渡时期的总路线服务，会议就如下几个中心问题作了专门研究。第一、关于水利事业为农业的社会主义改造服务的问题。（1）会议认为国营农场是社会主义成份，是全民所有制的财产，是推动农业的社会主义改造的杠杆，在解决粮食问题上，也起着重要作用。因此水利部门应满足国营农场在水利上的需要，积极配合农业部门提出国营农场的水利建设方案。并在技术上进行指导。（2）水利建设要促进农民走向合作化的道路。由国家投资举办的全部工程，本身就是社会主义财产；增加工程就增加社会主义成份。同时通过小型水利可以推动农村的互助合作运动。单干户甚至互助组兴修水利都有困难。组成合作社就好办些。所以水利更需要合作化，更需要集体力量，因此水利工作需要很好依靠合作社，帮助合作社并推动其发展。当然对个体农民也要同样帮助，不能歧视，以逐渐吸引其组织起来。（3）重点试办抽水机站。这是将来农业集体化、机械化的工具；许多地方都需要，特别是南方水稻地区，更应加以重视。为了稳步发展，最近几年内应当重点试办，调查研究，摸清抽水机的使用规律，研究今后的发展方案。以便根据需要和可能逐步发展。（4）各大区、省、专区、县都应根据上级总的部署，研究本地水流的基本情况、群众需要和发展方向，特别是省、县都要摸清水情，权衡轻重缓急，实事求是地根据客观需要和主观力量，做出全面、长期的治水打算，以使水利建设能完全符合于总路线的要求。第二、对做好水利建设计划和勘察设计工作，提高大型水利工程质量，更好地完成一九五四年水利建设计划也作了研究。会议指出过去做的许多大型水利工程中，在勘察、规划、设计、施工等方面都存在着较为严重的赶工现象，以致不少工程形成窝工、返工、抢工、工程质量不佳、器材积压和巨大浪费损失。会议根据兴建大型水利工程的稳步前进的方针，要求各地要坚持贯彻基本建设程序；加强规划设计等基本工作。其中特别强调要端正勘察设计人员的设计思想。因为工程设计是国家计划的具体体现，要从国家总路线出发，全面地考虑政治的、经济的和技术的关系，作综合性的比较研究，才能找到最合理的方案。为集中使用勘察设计力量，会议根据苏联专家的建议，拟从中央水利部开始着手调整现有的勘察设计机构。各大区和各省也要适当地集中设计力量，加强现有的勘察设计机构。此外，还决定有计划、有步骤地进行某些河流的流域规划工作，以便更好地把人民当前的利益和长远的利益，局部的利益和整体的利益结合起来，使水利建设符合于国家工业化和农业生产发展的需要，更准确地为国家总路线服务。第三、会议还研究了加强施工管理和工程管理的问题。过去在施工管理方面是在摸索中逐步前进的；有不少工程不作计划就施工或边设计边施工，现在已作到有技术设计再施工。去年十一月初旬正式开工的浑河大伙房水库工程，开工前还较周密地编制了施工组织设计。佛子岭水库工程，从去年六、七月间调整组织、实行生产改革后，已能根据定额编制作业计划，并按计划进行施工，初步走入计划管理的轨道。会议对今后进一步加强施工管理工作，提出了许多改进意见：对大型工程要求做好施工组织设计和掌握作业计划，建立技术责任制和技术检查制度，加强技术管理。对中小型工程则应加强施工的计划性和技术指导，以保证工程质量。有重点、有步骤地加强定额工作，逐步积累定额资料，这对改进生产、提高技术、节省资材和加强施工计划性都有直接的重要意义。此外并提出了加强工地的器材和财务管理和注意工地安全卫生等工作，以使每个工程力求做到“好、省、快和安全”等要求。在工程管理方面，会议要求各地认真纠正在干部中存在的“重工程、轻管理”的思想偏向。从领导机关到每个工程，都须健全必要的工程管理机构或专职人员，逐步拟订每个工程的操作运用、养护、管理、测验、记录、警卫等制度和办法，并研究加强对天然河道湖泊的养护管理，以保证每个水利设施尽量延长使用年限，充分发挥对农业生产、航运和城市工业用水的应有效益。　（新华社）
