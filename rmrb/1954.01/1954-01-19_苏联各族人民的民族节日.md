    National Festivals of the Peoples of the Soviet Union
    Soviet Writer A. Birvintsev
    On January 18, 1954, all the peoples of the Soviet Union commemorated the 300th anniversary of the notable historical event of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia. This great and solemn day is not only a true festival for Russians and Ukrainians, but also a great victory for all the peoples of the Soviet Union, because the fraternal and firm unity between the Russians and Ukrainians and the numerous other nationalities of the Soviet Union is the main foundation and powerful source of the great strength of the multinational state. Every Soviet person, no matter where he lives—whether at the foot of the Caucasus Mountains, or in the tundra of the North, in the spurs of the Tianshan Mountains, or on the plains of Belarus, in the central regions of Russia, or in the remote areas of Yakutia—on this day is especially proud of his socialist motherland, and full of confidence and joy in the great cooperation of all nationalities. This cooperation was created by the Communist Party with heroic efforts, and Lenin called it the wisdom, honor, and conscience of our time.
    The history of Ukraine is educational. Dangerous flames often flashed on the land of this nation, and Ukraine's geographical location made it an ideal springboard for attacking Russia from the West or South, from the Black Sea or the Sea of Azov. Under the banners of the Turkish and Tatar nomads, and under the flags of Poland and other kingdoms, invaders set out from these places more than once, leaving their footprints on the lands of Ukraine and Russia.
    There is no doubt that in the struggle against all enemies, the union of the Ukrainian and Russian peoples, linked by a common origin, the closeness and commonality of the entire historical development, is a direct historical necessity. Ukraine regarded the Russian nation as its natural and powerful protector, which, with its own strength alone, could free the Ukrainians from national oppression. The union of these two nations was what their enemies feared most.
    At the end of the 16th and the beginning of the 17th centuries, there were many uprisings of the Ukrainian people against the Polish nobles who plundered and enslaved Ukrainian lands. The armed uprisings that burned throughout Ukraine and later spread to Belarus, which was invaded by Polish nobles, were usually led by the Zaporozhian camps. This was a powerful military organization. History has left the glorious names of the leaders of these armed uprisings for freedom—Christopher Kosinski, Loboda, Nalivaiko, Taras Fedorovich, Pavlyuk (Pavel But), Yakov Ostryanin (Ostrenica)—in the memory of our descendants.
    No force—neither weapons, nor betrayal, nor intrigues—ever subdued the freedom-loving Ukrainian people's will to fight for their rights. But what was being waged at that time was a struggle of disparate strength.
    The uprising led by the Cossack leader Ostrenica was the last attempt during this period to break free from the oppression of the Polish nobles. Ostrenica won a brilliant victory on the Starica River, but he was captured by treacherous enemies and cruelly executed. This uprising finally failed.
    The period of silence that followed the failure of this uprising—what the enslavers called the period of "golden tranquility"—was maintained by bloody suppression. Ukraine was full of Polish troops everywhere—mercenaries of Polish landlords. The appalling oppression and brutal massacres of the residents caused a large number of Ukrainians to flee to Russia. In the Donets River region, the border area between Russia and Ukraine, a Ukrainian immigrant residential area was created—the current Kharkov region.
    This liberation struggle is filled with the heroic enthusiasm that reveals the power of the people's love for their motherland. In this period of Ukrainian history, one can see the ever-changing tension and profound patriotic enthusiasm. In this most difficult era, the Ukrainian people placed their hopes on the assistance of the Russians. In the liberation war against foreign invaders, the blood shed by the heroes aroused strong acts of revenge. The Ukrainian people tempered and consolidated their national characteristics in the flames of the uprising. It was this characteristic that made them stronger and more determined, enabling them to clearly see their established goals and historical prospects.
    In 1648, a new and widespread flame of people's war was ignited in Ukraine. The Ukrainian people waged a struggle to liberate their land from the oppression of the Polish nobles and to merge Ukraine and Russia. The leader of this people's uprising was Bogdan (Zinoviy) Mikhailovich Khmelnitsky. Khmelnitsky himself had experienced the bloody oppression of the Polish nobles. His ten-year-old son was flogged to death by the deputy village chief of Chigirin village in the Chaporin district. His estate in Shubertowo village was invaded and looted. But Khmelnitsky not only felt the personal humiliation he suffered, he also saw the humiliation suffered by his own people, and he was deeply saddened by the deprivation of the sacred rights of the Ukrainian people.
    In the lower reaches of the Dnieper River, Khmelnitsky gathered the Cossacks—“free people”—and launched a large-scale uprising. This uprising relied on the oppressed Ukrainian peasants, which was the main and decisive force in the liberation war. The Ukrainian peasants rose up against foreign enslavement and the social oppression of feudal serf owners. Their struggle received enthusiastic response and sympathy from the Polish peasants who were also oppressed by Polish feudal lords.
    In the first battle near the Yellow Waters River, Khmelnitsky dealt a heavy blow to the Polish military commander Stefan Potocki. In the same year, he also defeated the enemy at Korsun and captured all the enemy's artillery, baggage, and flags.
    However, the further development of events pointed out that those who attempted to drive out the invaders for their own interests were difficult to finally defeat the experienced and cunning foreign enemy in the case of scattered forces. Neither Khmelnitsky's victory on the Piliiavtsi River, nor the heroic battle of the guerrilla commander Cossack leader Maxim Krivonos, and the assault of the Pogen Cossacks under the city of Berestechko in Volhynia, achieved final victory.
    Due to the disparity in strength between the two sides, the liberation war, which initially won several brilliant victories, almost ended in failure. Those armed uprisings, which were launched not only among Ukrainians and Belarusians, but also among ordinary Polish people against the oppression of Polish landlords, were submerged in blood and damaged the sprouts of freedom that had long been desired.
    Bogdan Khmelnitsky, the loyal son and visionary statesman of the Ukrainian people, came to the only conclusion that was supported by all Ukrainians: he saw that only the union of the Ukrainian people and the great Russian people could save the Ukrainian nation. This conscious desire of the entire Ukrainian people was finally expressed on January 8 (18), 1654, at the Pereyaslav (i.e., today's Pereyaslav-Khmelnytskyi, Kiev Oblast) Cossack Council. This council discussed whether Ukraine should submit to the medieval Kingdom of Poland, or recognize the leadership of Turkey and the Crimean Tatars, or merge with Russia. A unanimous decision was passed that was urgently needed by the Ukrainian and Russian nations and was determined by the entire historical process.
    The decision to merge with Russia was a progressive decision. It saved the Ukrainian nation and established the economic and political commonality, and the close fraternal ties of the Russian and Ukrainian nations which had existed since ancient times. This decision not only fully conformed to historical inevitability, but also corresponded to the sincere wishes of the two major nations. It rescued Ukraine from the enslavement of foreign invaders, and enabled these two united forces to fight together against their common enemy. In this very year of 1654, Russia sent 200,000 troops to the battlefield. The war to liberate the occupied Ukrainian, Belarusian, and Lithuanian lands began. This war won a complete victory. The friendship of the Russian, Ukrainian, and Belarusian nations was consolidated due to common bloodshed and achieved its due result. The principle of the Pereyaslav Cossack Council—“to coexist for eternity”—was finally established.
    The further development of Ukraine was carried out under the oppression of the Tsarist system. Nevertheless, the outstanding sons of the Russian people all recognized Ukrainian national sovereignty, and, together with the advanced activists of the Ukrainian people, fought against Great-Russian chauvinism and the bourgeois nationalists of Ukraine. It is almost entirely unnecessary to prove that in these hundreds of years until the October Revolution, the development of the Russian and Ukrainian nations was carried out under the same type of socio-political conditions.
    Ukraine and its abundant resources aroused the covetousness of foreign capitalists. Utilizing the underdevelopment of Tsarist Russia's own industry, Western imperialists secretly, without "military operations," seized most of the shares of industrial enterprises in the Donbas, Krivoy Rog, and Nikopol areas of Ukraine. Just as usual in the case of such economic aggression, foreign capitalists paid little attention to the correct exploitation of natural resources. The plunderers, as expected, carried out savage plunder. Ukraine's productivity was tied up and subordinated to the interests of foreign capitalists and, to a lesser extent, Russian capitalists. As usual, the industry of extracting raw materials and producing semi-finished products and the agricultural product processing industry were developed. More than 50 percent of the land belonged to landlords and other exploiters. Western Ukraine was under the oppression of foreign invaders.
    The Great October Socialist Revolution liberated Ukraine from social and national oppression and enabled it to establish its own truly people's socialist state. The unity of the Russian and Ukrainian nations became stronger and more solid.
    Lenin wrote: "A free Ukraine is possible only if the Great Russian and Ukrainian proletarians act in unison. Without this unity, it is impossible..."
    After the October Revolution, there were many great storms in Ukraine. Foreign armed intervention, the civil war, and the devastation of the Cossack military leaders and Denikin's men throughout Ukraine seemed to have caused fatal wounds to Ukraine. But the Russian nation, and the other nations united in Soviet cooperation with it, once again extended a helping hand. They rescued Ukraine from poverty and helped it in its work—Ukraine achieved unprecedented prosperity during several five-year plans. The Soviet social and state system, and the Lenin-Stalin national policy opened up a broad road for all nationalities and tribes of all Soviet countries to develop productive forces, prosper economically and culturally. Ukraine also achieved prosperity in the same way. Here, everything produced by all minerals and lands, factories and manufacturing plants, and all cultural and national treasures accumulated from ancient times to the present belong to the Soviet people—the producers and enjoyers of these treasures.
    In 1939 and 1940, all the Ukrainian lands previously occupied by foreign countries were reincorporated into a unified Soviet national state. The phenomenon of generations of Ukrainians being separated from each other no longer existed forever. Ukraine prospered, and its national culture developed. When the Russian people mentioned the name of Pushkin, they also mentioned the name of Shevchenko, and when they talked about Ostrovsky, they also mentioned the names of Ivan Franko and Lesya Ukrainka. They appreciated Lysenko's music and sang the Ukrainian enthusiastic and melodious songs.
    After the October Revolution, Soviet Ukraine produced many outstanding figures in various fields of science, culture, and socio-political activities.
    Stakhanov emerged from Donbas; in the metallurgical industry, there was Markel Masoy's initiative; in the transportation industry, there was Krivonos' initiative; in the Ukrainian fields, the glory of tractor drivers represented by Angelina and the honor of sugar beet growers represented by Maria Gimchenko, and the honor of many others were spread.
    The Great Patriotic War was a severe test for Ukraine. The fascist bandits ravaged the entire Ukraine with artillery fire. Everything seemed to have turned to ashes; it seemed that it would take decades to rebuild everything, to send new manpower to the workshops of various enterprises, to pump the water out of the flooded mines, and to revive the land destroyed by the war to bear fruit again.
    We war participants looked with sorrow and anger at the precious items created by hardworking hands for many years being tragically damaged and destroyed. When we entered the liberated Ukrainian cities and villages with the army, blood surged into everyone's hearts. And we all understood what kind of indestructible great force had been accumulated, and this force quickly supported its brothers and helped them heal their wounds. When the war was still going on on Soviet soil, the restoration work had already begun. People organized by the Communist Party's goal-oriented and unified will flocked to Ukraine in an endless stream. Here, the great friendship and fraternal cooperation of all nationalities was once again manifested. This friendship and cooperation was, is, and will be the main condition for the achievements of all Soviet republics.
    After the victory of the war, Ukraine launched the restoration work with all its strength. People turned the energy of the front line to the new battlefield—the struggle for the revival of the republic. The impossible became reality. The Kramatorsk Heavy Machinery Plant, which stood gloomily in ruins yesterday, today raised black smoke from its chimneys, and the workshops were rumbling. Yesterday, the riverbank of the Dnieper River was still gaping with its cracks, and today the Dnieper Hydroelectric Power Station has re-broadcasted vibrant electricity.
    Recently, we have seen that under the intense efforts of all fraternal nationalities in the Soviet Union, responding to the call of the Party, Muscovites and Kazakhs, Uzbeks and Kyrgyz, Georgians and Azerbaijanis have all come to help the dear Ukrainians, who are closely related to them all, arrange their lives well.
    Here, one can see everything that our ancestors foresaw with their wise and sharp eyes at the Pereyaslav Conference in the very early days! Just as in a living and active organism, the destruction of any cell tissue will cause red blood cells to rush to its aid, so in the living organism of the socialist country, the same conscious activity of mutual assistance and mutual enrichment is also carried out.
    The big family of the peoples of the Soviet Union can not only restore everything that was destroyed and damaged by the war, but also greatly surpass everything that was created before the war. At the same time, in this huge and conscious labor, the vitality of the system of relations that has formed between the peoples of the Soviet Union, who speak different languages but have the same ideals and goals, is particularly evident. This is because all these nationalities have been advancing along the new socialist road, and they have found that this is the road to realizing the ideals of their nationalities for generations, and this road guarantees the all-round prosperity of the economy and culture....
    January 18, 1954, is a great festival for the Russian and Ukrainian nationalities, the entire people of the Soviet Union, and all socialist nationalities. They are all celebrating this historically significant day wholeheartedly, sincerely, and enthusiastically. People celebrate it so solemnly because there have been so many severe and arduous days in the past. The friendship of the Russian and Ukrainian nationalities has been violated for so many years and centuries. History has examined this friendship with its fair eyes. This friendship has been tempered thousands of times, but it is completely able to withstand it! And it has become even more consolidated! The practice of past events and daily work itself explains everything, so that we can see what formula was used to temper the immortal steel block that consolidates the great alliance of unbreakable socialist nationalities.

    苏联各族人民的民族节日
    苏联作家　阿·毕尔文采夫
    苏联各族人民都在一九五四年一月十八日纪念乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯这个著名历史事件的三百周年。这个伟大隆重的日子不仅是俄罗斯人和乌克兰人的真正节日，而且也是苏联各族人民的伟大胜利，因为俄罗斯人同乌克兰人与苏联其他人数众多的民族之间的兄弟般的牢固团结，是多民族国家巨大力量的主要基础和强大泉源。每一个苏联人，不论他住在什么地方——在高加索的山麓，还是北方的苔原，在天山的支脉还是白俄罗斯的平原，在俄罗斯的中央地区，还是雅库梯的边远地区——这一天都为自己的社会主义祖国而特别感到自豪，都对各民族的伟大合作满怀着信心和喜悦。这种合作是由共产党以英勇的努力缔造的，列宁曾称它为我们时代的智慧、荣誉和良心。
    乌克兰的历史是富有教育意义的。在这个民族的土地上时常闪耀着凶险的火光，乌克兰的地理位置使它成为不论由西方或南方，由黑海或亚速海进攻俄罗斯的理想跳板。在土耳其和鞑靼游牧民族的军旗下，在波兰和其他王国的旗帜下侵略者不止一次地从这些地方出发，在乌克兰和俄罗斯的土地上留下了他们的足迹。
    不容怀疑，在反对所有敌人的斗争中，由于共同的起源、整个历史发展的密切性和共同性而联系起来的乌克兰和俄罗斯民族的联合，乃是一种直接的历史发展的必然性。乌克兰把俄罗斯民族看做自己自然的强有力的保护者，这个保护者只用自己的力量就能使乌克兰人免于遭受民族的压迫。这两个民族的联合是他们的敌人所最害怕的。
    十六世纪末和十七世纪初发生了乌克兰人民的多次起义，反对掠夺和奴役乌克兰土地的波兰贵族。在乌克兰全境燃烧起来，后来又蔓延到波兰贵族所侵掠的白俄罗斯境内的武装起义，照例是由萨坡罗什野营所领导的。这是一种强大的军事组织。历史已把领导这些争取自由的武装起义者的光荣名字——克里斯多夫·科辛斯基、罗保德、纳利瓦伊科、塔拉斯·费奥多罗维奇、巴甫留克（帕夫尔·布特）、雅可夫·奥斯特里亚宁（奥斯特尼查）——留在我们后代人的记忆中。
    任何力量——不论是武器、背叛行为和阴谋诡计都不曾折服爱好自由的乌克兰人民争取自己权利的斗争意志。但是当时所进行的都是一场力量悬殊的斗争。
    哥萨克的首领奥斯特尼查所领导的起义是在这一时期中企图摆脱波兰贵族压迫的最后一次尝试，奥斯特尼查在斯塔里查河上赢得了辉煌的胜利，但是他为背信弃义的敌人所捕获并被残酷地处死，这次起义终于失败了。
    随着这次起义失败之后到来的沉寂期——即奴役者们所谓“黄金的平静”期，是用血腥的镇压维持着的。乌克兰到处布满了波兰的军队——波兰地主的雇佣兵。对居民的骇人听闻的压迫和残暴的屠杀使乌克兰人大量地逃往俄罗斯。在顿尼兹河区这个俄罗斯同乌克兰邻界的地方，产生了乌克兰的移民居留区——现在的哈尔科夫区。
    在这一解放斗争中充满着那种显出人民热爱祖国的力量的英雄的热情。在乌克兰的这段历史中，可以看到变化多端的紧张局势和深厚的爱国热情。在这个最艰苦的年代中，乌克兰人民把希望寄托在俄罗斯人的援助上。在反对外国侵略者的解放战争中，英雄们所流的血引起了强烈的复仇行为。乌克兰人民在起义的火焰中锻炼而且巩固了本民族的特性，就是这特性使他们更刚强更坚定，使他们明确地看到既定目标和历史远景。
    一六四八年在乌克兰燃起了新的广泛的人民战争的火焰。乌克兰人民进行了要求把自己的土地从波兰贵族的压迫下解放出来、并使乌克兰和俄罗斯合并的斗争。领导这次人民起义的是波格丹（辛纳维依）·米哈依洛维奇·赫米尔尼茨基。赫米尔尼茨基亲自经历过波兰贵族的血腥的压迫。他十岁的儿子是被查波林区契吉林村的副村长鞭笞而死的。他在舒伯特渥村的田产被侵占被抢光了。但赫米尔尼茨基不但感觉到个人所受的欺凌，他还看到本族人民所遭受的耻辱，他为乌克兰人民的神圣权利被剥夺而深感痛苦。
    在第聂伯河的下游，赫米尔尼茨基召集了哥萨克——“自由的人们”并举行了规模壮大的起义。这次起义依靠着受压迫的乌克兰农民，这是解放战争中主要的、决定的力量。乌克兰的农民起而反对外国的奴役和封建农奴主的社会压迫。他们的斗争获得了也在受波兰封建主压迫的波兰农民的热烈响应和同情。
    在黄水河附近的第一次战役中赫米尔尼茨基迎头痛击了波兰的军事指挥官斯吉芬·波托茨基。同年，他又在科尔苏尼击溃了敌军，并夺得了敌人的全部大炮、辎重和旗帜。
    但是事件的进一步发展指出，为了切身的利益企图把侵略者驱逐出境的人们，在力量分散的情况下是难以最后战胜有经验的和诡计多端的外敌的。不论是赫米尔尼茨基在皮列乌加河上的胜利，或是游击队的指挥者哥萨克首领马克辛·克里沃诺斯的英勇战斗，以及波根的哥萨克们在沃伦省别列斯吉茨克城下的突击都没有获致最后的胜利。
    由于双方力量的悬殊，最初赢得若干辉煌胜利的解放战争，几乎是以失败告终的。那些不仅在乌克兰人和白俄罗斯人中，而且也在反对波兰地主压迫的波兰普通人民中掀起的武装起义，淹没在血泊之中，并长期地损害了那久为人们所渴望的自由的幼芽。
    波格丹·赫米尔尼茨基，乌克兰人民的忠诚儿子和眼光远大的政治家，得出了为全体乌克兰人所支持的唯一的结论：他看出，只有乌克兰人民和伟大的俄罗斯人民的联合才能拯救乌克兰民族。全体乌克兰人民的这个自觉的意愿终于在一六五四年一月八日（十八日）举行的佩雷雅斯拉夫（即今天的基辅州佩雷雅斯拉夫——赫米尔尼茨基城）哥萨克议会上表达出来。这次议会讨论了乌克兰是归顺中世纪的波兰王国，还是承认土耳其和克里米亚鞑靼的领导，还是和俄罗斯合并的问题。全体一致通过了那个为乌克兰和俄罗斯民族所迫切需要并由全部历史进程所决定的决议。
    同俄罗斯合并的决议是一个带有进步性的决定，它拯救了乌克兰民族，并把俄罗斯和乌克兰这两个民族自古以来在经济和政治上的共同性，它们的骨肉相连的兄弟般的联系确定下来。这个决定不仅完全适合历史的必然性，而且也符合两大民族的切身愿望。它把乌克兰由外国侵略者的奴役下拯救出来，并使这两个联合起来的力量能够一道反对它们共同的敌人。就在这一六五四年，俄罗斯派遣了二十万军队上战场。解放被侵占的乌克兰、白俄罗斯和立陶宛的土地的战争开始了。这次战争获得了全部胜利。俄罗斯、乌克兰以及白俄罗斯民族的友谊由于共同的流血而巩固并获得了它的应有的成果。佩雷雅斯拉夫哥萨克议会的原则——“永世共存亡”，最后被确定下来。
    乌克兰的进一步发展是在遭受沙皇制度压迫的情况下进行的。虽然如此，俄罗斯人民的优秀儿子们都承认乌克兰的民族主权，并同乌克兰人民的先进活动家们一起，向大国沙文主义和乌克兰的资产阶级民族主义分子进行了斗争。几乎完全没有必要证明，在这数百年中直到十月革命止，俄罗斯民族和乌克兰民族的发展是在同一型式的社会政治情况下进行的。
    乌克兰和它的丰富的资源引起了外国资本主义者的觊觎。西方帝国主义者利用沙皇俄国本国工业的不发达，偷偷地、不经过“军事行动”地夺取了乌克兰的顿巴斯、克里沃洛格、尼古波里地方的工业企业中大部分的股份。正像平常在这类经济侵略的情况下那样，外国资本家很少注意对天然富源作正确的开采。掠夺者们正如所预料的那样，进行了野蛮的掠夺。乌克兰的生产力受到了束缚，并被置于从属于外国资本家以及在较小的程度上从属于俄罗斯资本家的利益之下。照例是发展了开采原料和生产半制品的工业和实行农产品加工工业。百分之五十以上的土地归地主和其他剥削者所有。西部乌克兰处于外国侵略者的压迫之下。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命把乌克兰从社会和民族的压迫下解放出来，并使它能够建立自己的、真正的人民的社会主义的国家。俄罗斯和乌克兰民族的团结一致更坚强更牢固了。
    列宁写道：“如果伟大的俄罗斯和乌克兰无产阶级能够统一行动，自由的乌克兰就有可能出现。没有这种统一，它是不可能出现的……。”
    十月革命后在乌克兰发生过多次的大风暴。外国武装干涉、国内战争、哥萨克军事领袖和邓尼金分子们在乌克兰全境的蹂躏，似乎已使乌克兰遭到了致命的创伤。但是俄罗斯民族、以及同它一道的其他以社会主义各民族的苏维埃合作联合起来的各民族，又一次伸出了援助的手。它们把乌克兰从贫困中解救出来，并在工作上给它以帮助——乌克兰在几个五年计划期间获得了空前的繁荣。苏维埃的社会和国家制度，列宁—斯大林的民族政策为所有苏维埃国家的一切民族和部族打开了一条发展生产力、繁荣经济和文化的广阔道路。乌克兰也同样获得了繁荣。在这里，一切矿藏和土地、工厂和制造厂所出产的东西，所有从古至今积累起来的文化和民族珍品都属于苏维埃人——这些珍品的生产者和享有者。
    在一九三九到一九四○年中，所有以前被外国割据的乌克兰的土地重新合并到统一的苏维埃的民族国家中。乌克兰民族世世代代被隔绝的现象永远不再有了。乌克兰繁荣了，它的民族文化发展了。俄罗斯人民在说普希金的名字时，也提到谢夫钦科的名字，在谈奥斯特洛夫斯基时也说到伊凡·弗兰科和列斯·乌克兰基的名字。他们欣赏李森科的音乐，歌唱乌克兰的热情的、音调优美的歌曲。
    十月革命以后苏维埃乌克兰产生了不少在各种科学、文化、社会政治活动方面的杰出人物。
    斯大哈诺夫产生于顿巴斯；在冶金工业中有马克尔·马索依的创举；在运输业中有克里夫诺斯的创举；在乌克兰的田野上传扬着以安格林娜为代表的拖拉机手们的光荣和以马丽亚·吉姆琴柯为代表的甜菜种植者们的荣誉，和许多其他人的荣誉。
    伟大的卫国战争对于乌克兰是一次严重的考验。法西斯匪帮用炮火蹂躏了整个乌克兰。一切都好像已化为灰烬；要重新建设一切，给各个企业的车间输送新的人力，把被淹没的矿井中的水抽干，使被战争所破坏的土地重新苏醒过来生果结实，似乎非数十年不可。
    我们这些参加战争者带着悲伤和愤怒看着那为勤劳的手多年来所创造的珍贵物品惨遭到破坏和毁灭。当我们同军队一起进入被解放的乌克兰城市和乡村时，血涌上了每个人的心头。而我们全体懂得，是怎样一种不能被消灭的巨大力量已经积累起来，这个力量迅速地支持了自己的弟兄们，帮助他们医治好创伤。当战争还在苏维埃土地上进行的时候，复兴工作就已经开始了。由共产党的目标明确的统一意志所组织起来的人们，源源不绝地走向乌克兰。在这里，再一次体现出了各族人民的伟大友谊和兄弟般的合作。这种友谊和合作过去是，现在是，将来也是各苏维埃共和国成就的主要条件。
    战争胜利后，乌克兰以全力展开了恢复工作。人们把火线上的精力转向新的战场——争取共和国的复兴。不可思议的东西变成了现实。昨天还在废墟中阴郁地耸立着的克拉马托尔斯克重型机器工厂，今天在它的烟突中升起了黑烟，各车间已轰隆地响动起来。昨天第聂伯河的河堤还在张着它的裂口，今天第聂伯水力发电站已重新放送出生气勃勃的电力。
    最近，我们看到在全苏联各兄弟民族的紧张努力下，响应着党的号召，莫斯科人和哈萨克人，乌兹别克人和吉尔吉斯人，格鲁吉亚人和阿塞拜疆人都来帮助亲爱的、和他们全体都关系密切的乌克兰人安排好生活。
    在这里就可以看出，我们的祖先在很早以前的佩雷雅斯拉夫会议上以他们明智而锐利的目光所预见到的一切！正像在有生命力的活动的有机体中，任何细胞组织的遭到破坏都会使红血球赶来援助一样，在社会主义国家这个有生命力的有机体中，也在进行着这同一自觉的、互相帮助和互相丰富的活动。
    苏联各族人民的大家庭不仅能把为战争所毁坏和破坏的一切恢复起来，而且能大大地超越过战前所创造的一切。同时在这个巨大的、自觉的劳动中，也特别明显地表现了在语言不同、但理想和目标相同的苏联各族人民之间所形成的那种关系的制度所具有的生命力。这是因为所有这些民族已都在沿着新的社会主义道路前进，它们发现这是实现本民族世世代代的理想的道路，这条道路保证了经济和文化的全面繁荣……。
    一九五四年一月十八日是俄罗斯民族和乌克兰民族、苏联全体人民，所有社会主义各民族的一个伟大节日。他们都在全心全意地、真诚而热烈地庆祝这个具有历史意义的日子。人们之所以这样隆重地庆祝是因为过去曾经有过多少严厉的艰苦日子。俄罗斯和乌克兰民族的友谊在多少年和多少世纪中都受到侵害。历史曾用它的公正的眼睛检查了这个友谊。这一友谊曾经受过千锤百炼，但它是完全经受得住的！而且更加巩固了！历次事件和日常工作的实践本身说明了一切，从而可以看出那使牢不可破的社会主义各民族的伟大联盟得以巩固的不朽的钢块是用怎样的公式锻炼出来的。
