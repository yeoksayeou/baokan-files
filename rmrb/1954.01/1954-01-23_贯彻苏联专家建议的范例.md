    A Model of Implementing Soviet Expert Advice
    Fan Rongkang
    Great Gains
    In 1953, the famous Fengman Hydropower Station in our country installed a new, giant, automated hydro-turbine generator. This was a tremendous victory in the first year of our country's First Five-Year Plan.
    The installation team of the Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company of the Central Fuel Industry Department, under the guidance of Soviet experts, undertook this brand new and complex project. They installed the new, giant, automated hydro-turbine generator at a rate more than one and a half times faster than during the puppet Manchurian regime, and the quality fully met Soviet national standards.
    The workers of the Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team originally lacked installation experience, especially for this kind of giant, automated hydro-turbine generator, which they had never even seen, let alone installed. Half of the workers were farmers who had just put down their hoes, demobilized soldiers, and ordinary workers; some didn't even understand what installation was all about. Many of the technicians had only repaired small machines such as car motors in the past. Only six people nominally had participated in installation, and in reality, they only passed tools and watched others install. But such a team has now mastered the world's most advanced Soviet installation technology.
    The Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team also treasures a complete set of data on Soviet advanced installation methods, including "Generator Installation Method," "Turbine Installation Method," "Transformer Fast Installation Method," and "Power Plant Equipment Testing Method." These materials are a compilation of 617 suggestions and lecture records made by Soviet experts in response to practical problems in China's installation technical operations, based on advanced Soviet experience. It is a model of the combination of advanced Soviet experience and China's specific conditions, and is a guide for China's electrical machinery installation.
      The rapid and high-quality installation of the hydro-turbine generator, the growth of an installation team that has mastered advanced Soviet technology, and the compilation of six books of installation methods that combine advanced Soviet experience with China's specific conditions – these are the tremendous gains of the Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team's exemplary implementation of Soviet expert advice.
    Do a Good Job of Ideological Work for Implementing Soviet Expert Advice
    The first experience of the Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team in implementing Soviet expert advice is to conscientiously carry out ideological education, eliminate various ideological obstacles, and turn the slogan of implementing Soviet expert advice into the conscious action of the masses, so that the implementation of Soviet expert advice is guaranteed first in the minds of the masses.
    Before the foreign orders arrived and the Soviet experts came, the leading cadres of the Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company held a meeting to study the various unfavorable and favorable conditions of the upcoming installation project. The unfavorable condition was the lack of installation experience, especially the lack of experience in installing this kind of giant automated machine; the favorable condition was that the installation project would be carried out under the direct guidance of Soviet experts. Therefore, they reached a clear conclusion: the key to completing the installation task lies in implementing Soviet expert advice one hundred percent and carrying out work strictly in accordance with the guidance of Soviet experts. The leading cadres then studied the thinking of the masses. At that time, the thinking of some of the masses was still distant from the thinking of the leadership. They only saw their own lack of experience, but could not find the correct path of implementing Soviet expert advice. The following situations were hindering them from finding this path: one situation was a lack of understanding of the superiority of Soviet technology. They saw that Soviet large machines had many welds and suspected that the Soviet Union did not have the ability to cast large machines, but they did not know that welding was precisely an advanced Soviet experience, and the stability of welded parts was far superior to that of cast parts. They saw that Soviet machines were not refined enough in some places and said that Soviet machines were not good, but they did not know that being refined where it should be refined and not seeking refinement where it was not necessary was precisely the superiority of Soviet machines. Another situation was that some technicians and veteran workers were superstitious about old experiences. Although they felt that using old methods to install new machines might not be reliable, they did not give up the old methods, thinking, "The Soviet methods won't be much better." The leading cadres studied these ideological situations and believed that to open a correct path in front of the masses, they must eliminate these one-sided and erroneous understandings. Since 1949, Soviet experts had continuously come to the Fengman Hydropower Station, providing the entire reconstruction and restoration design of the Fengman Hydropower Station, repairing the dams that had been damaged by floods, were full of honeycombs, and leaked everywhere, and the overflow surfaces that had been frozen, controlling the fierce floods, overhauling the old generators that had been running for eight years, and increasing the output of the old generators. The Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team seized these vivid examples and used methods such as report meetings and recollection meetings to criticize doubts about the Soviet Union and Soviet technology. After the Soviet equipment was shipped, they focused on clearing the foreign orders and introducing the advantages of Soviet generators, such as automation, the simple structure of turbines, and increased output. At this time, the masses had personally seen the benefits of Soviet machines and began to appreciate the importance of implementing Soviet expert advice. However, this understanding was not very stable at the time, and some people still held a skeptical attitude.
    The Soviet experts came to the construction site under these circumstances. In the early stages of construction, the "wheel spoke sleeve shaft" incident occurred, shaking all the workers. The wheel spoke and the shaft are two parts on the generator. During construction, the wheel spoke must be sleeved on the large shaft. Initially, the Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team made preparations according to the construction methods of the puppet Manchurian regime, and determined the construction period to be twenty-one days. After the Soviet experts arrived, they completely negated the installation methods of the puppet Manchurian regime and proposed new suggestions. As a result of implementing this suggestion, the entire project, including preparation work, was completed in only two days.
      The workers called the wheel spoke sleeve shaft "the first shot of the Soviet experts." This first shot educated everyone and opened the path for implementing Soviet expert advice with vivid facts. The leadership seized this most vivid example to educate the workers to recognize that implementing Soviet expert advice is the key to determining the quality, speed, economy, and safety of the project, and called on the workers to conscientiously implement Soviet expert advice.
      However, the wheel spoke sleeve shaft did not move the hearts of some technicians who always thought they knew a lot. In implementing the Soviet experts' suggestions, they were accustomed to using their own methods first. If it didn't work, they would then adopt the Soviet experts' suggestions. For example, the Soviet experts suggested that the guide vane inter-gap should start from one side, but the turbine plant technician Zheng Xianwen believed that the Soviet experts' suggestions needed "consideration," so he arbitrarily decided to divide from the middle to both sides, resulting in rework. Some technicians in the laboratory did not conduct experiments according to the methods suggested by the Soviet experts, and one task was reworked three times. The Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team believed that technicians were the bridge for implementing Soviet expert advice. They were familiar with drawings and regulations, often close to Soviet experts, and directly responsible for technically guiding workers in construction. Therefore, correcting technicians' understanding of implementing Soviet expert advice was an important link in ensuring the implementation of Soviet expert advice. Therefore, they seized the above examples and launched ideological criticism among the technicians, and at the same time, they used technician Chen Hanmin, who actively studied and actively implemented Soviet expert advice and helped all the coil winding class workers learn the Soviet experts' suggestions, ensuring the quality of the coil winding project, as a model to spread his thinking and experience in implementing Soviet expert advice. Soon after, the technicians' attitude towards implementing Soviet expert advice changed significantly.
    Doubt about the Soviet Union and Soviet technology is a direct ideological obstacle to implementing Soviet expert advice, but it is not the entire ideological obstacle. There are also various different ideological situations that hinder the implementation of Soviet expert advice. One is actively learning the Soviet experts' suggestions, but not actively implementing the Soviet experts' suggestions. These people believe that "learning skills well will get you anywhere," and attempt to treat the Soviet experts' suggestions as private property, remembering more, speaking less, writing more in their own notebooks, and writing less in the public notebooks. The workers called these people "embezzlers of Soviet expert advice." Another is the lack of a pragmatic ideological style. They are clearly not sure about implementing the Soviet experts' suggestions, but they do not raise the actual situation and difficulties for study. Instead, they make promises, and as a result, the Soviet experts' suggestions are still not implemented. These situations show that certain bad ideological styles of technicians and cadres are also hindering the implementation of Soviet expert advice. The Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team, on the one hand, seized the Soviet experts' pragmatic, responsible, and selfless work style and internationalist spirit to carry out positive ideological education to the workers, and on the other hand, educated the above-mentioned erring personnel on certain occasions to help them recognize their mistakes.
    The Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team made higher demands on Party members and League members. They required Party members and League members to recognize that studying the Soviet Union is the Party's political line and is one of the criteria for assessing the political quality of every Party member and League member. They required every Party member and League member to first ensure the implementation of Soviet expert advice.
      The ideological work of the Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team in implementing Soviet expert advice is not only aimed at different targets and different ideological situations at different times, not only good at seizing the most typical and vivid examples, but also pays attention to carrying it out around the main work of each period and the main requirements of the leadership. For example, during the preparation stage, when clearing foreign arrivals, they guided the masses to recognize the superiority of Soviet machines and proposed, "Cherish the machines from the Soviet Union and do not damage a small part," promoting the progress of the preparation work. In the early stages of installation, the slogan was: "Conscientiously implement Soviet expert advice and universally improve technology by one level during the installation process." In the later stages of installation, they proposed: "Go from not understanding to understanding, from being unfamiliar to being skilled, from being skilled to being proficient, and seek to master a professional knowledge." These different slogans in different periods all revolved around the central idea of implementing Soviet expert advice, put forward clear requirements, and mobilized everyone.
      Raise Questions
    Before the Soviet experts arrived, the Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team carried out partial pre-assembly of components. One of the gains of the pre-assembly was the discovery of a few parts with tight joints and other problems. These problems were all recorded. After the Soviet experts arrived, they immediately received this information. The Soviet experts highly praised this work, because this information raised the difficult problems of the components themselves in the installation, enabling the Soviet experts to promptly make suggestions, quickly handle them, and start construction as early as possible. The second experience of the Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team in implementing Soviet expert advice proves that: comprehensively and systematically presenting the situation and raising questions is an important task in obtaining Soviet expert advice and implementing Soviet expert advice.
      However, after the official start of construction, the situation became more complicated. Many sub-projects were progressing simultaneously, and each process was closely linked, with hundreds of workers operating day and night. It was impossible to foresee all the problems before the start of these many sub-projects and processes, but it was very necessary to carefully consider the possible problems before the start of each sub-project, raise difficulties, and listen to the experts' suggestions. At first, this work was not done well. Some problems were missed, some were not considered thoroughly and not asked completely, and some simply did not actively consider the problems and asked the Soviet experts about everything.
    At this time, in order to establish order in talking with Soviet experts and prevent phenomena such as asking questions randomly and repeatedly, the leadership established a system of talking with Soviet experts, designating specific personnel to talk with Soviet experts at each site. This system was necessary, but the masses raised a question about this system: "If you don't let us find experts, what do we do if we have difficulties?"
    The facts are very clear. The project itself and the masses both require the establishment of a system to facilitate the comprehensive presentation of the actual operational difficulties felt by the masses to the Soviet experts in advance, rather than temporarily embracing Buddha's feet, and to listen to the Soviet experts' suggestions. Therefore, a system emerged in which, before the start of each sub-project, the site director, technicians, and some cadres above the team and group leader level jointly studied what difficult problems there were in the upcoming sub-project, comprehensively considered the construction methods, quality standards, safety measures, personnel organization, and supply of tools and materials, and talked with the Soviet experts based on these difficulties and considered problems to listen to the Soviet experts' suggestions. Based on the Soviet experts' suggestions and our various opinions agreed to by the Soviet experts, they compiled a construction measures plan. The construction measures plan was then given to the workers for discussion. If the workers did not understand, the technicians could not answer, or the workers raised other questions, they would invite the Soviet experts to explain. This system ensured that problems were reflected to the Soviet experts more comprehensively and greatly reduced the phenomenon of temporarily embracing Buddha's feet during construction.
      Grasp the Situation of Soviet Expert Advice
    The third experience of the Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team in implementing Soviet expert advice is that it is necessary to grasp the situation of Soviet expert advice day by day and level by level and to guarantee the implementation of Soviet expert advice from the perspective of enterprise management. The Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team used three kinds of record books to grasp the situation of Soviet expert advice.
    The first to appear was the interpreter's oral interpretation record book. Wang Yuexuan, deputy manager and installation team leader of the Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company, once thought: Eighteen Soviet experts came to the installation team. They work on site every day and offer many suggestions. Implementing these suggestions is the key to completing the installation task. Is it okay not to grasp the situation of Soviet expert advice? Therefore, Wang Yuexuan made a request to the interpreters: record the Soviet experts' suggestions every day and hand them over to him. Based on this request, the translation section formulated an oral interpretation record book, stipulating that the contents to be filled in were: time, content of the suggestion, who suggested it, and to whom it was suggested. Each interpreter filled out one form every day, signed it, and handed it to the translation section for summary to the team leader. The first few days of implementing the oral interpretation record book proved that it was very necessary. From these simple records, Wang Yuexuan grasped what suggestions the Soviet experts had provided, and these suggestions accurately reflected the main problems in all aspects of the project and how to solve them. This enabled the leading cadres to have a clear understanding of the situation and provided the best basis for supervising and inspecting work. Later, the oral interpretation record book added a regulation: after the interpreters filled it out, they handed it over to the person who talked with the Soviet expert to read and sign, indicating that he had fully understood the suggestion and was responsible for its implementation. At the same time, after reading it, the person who talked with the Soviet expert could also avoid technical errors in the record.
    The oral interpretation record book only solved the problem of the team leader grasping the situation of Soviet expert advice and supervising and inspecting the implementation of Soviet expert advice. At that time, each site and section/office did not have a record book. At the site/section level, the Soviet experts' suggestions were only recorded in the technicians' small notebooks. The site/section chiefs could not grasp them, and the technicians inevitably forgot them, which became a loophole in the implementation of Soviet expert advice. In the laboratory, the Soviet experts suggested making a movable ladder to avoid damaging the instruments when taking instruments from the instrument rack. This suggestion was delayed for a long time without being implemented, and the phenomenon of damaging instruments continued to occur. One of the reasons was that no one recorded this suggestion and no one urged its implementation. In response to this situation, a site-level registration book was established, with the site director and technicians responsible for filling in the Soviet experts' suggestions.
    The third type of record book is the group registration book. Before the establishment of the group registration book, an event occurred at the generator plant. On this day, the Chen Bin group was doing the work of stacking iron sheets and tightening screws. The screws were very large and very long. They were hammered with a sledgehammer, and when they could no longer be hammered, they thought they were tight and asked the Soviet experts to check. The Soviet experts tapped on the screw caps with their hands and listened with their ears to check whether they were really tightened. If they were not tight, they would hit them a few times with a sledgehammer and then tighten them with pliers. The Soviet experts taught the Chen Bin group how to use this method of checking and tightening screws. At the end of the shift, Chen Bin verbally explained the Soviet experts' suggestion to the oncoming shift leader. However, the next day, when the workers in the Chen Bin group came to work, they found that the workers in the class were waiting for the Soviet experts to check the screws, completely unaware that the Soviet experts already had suggestions for checking and tightening screws and had personally taught them how to do it. After further investigation, it turned out that because there was no written record, the Soviet experts' suggestions were lost between the two shifts. At that time, the workers' enthusiasm for implementing Soviet expert advice was very high. Some said: "One sentence from an expert is enough for us to think about for half a day; one suggestion from an expert is something we can't figure out for half a month." "Implementing Soviet expert advice without missing a single detail" became the universal demand of the masses. The establishment of the group registration book ensured that the Soviet experts' suggestions would not be interrupted by shift changes.
    These three types of record books played a significant role in the Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team's implementation of Soviet expert advice. It enabled leaders at all levels to grasp the situation of Soviet expert advice, understand the key issues in the project and the solutions, and have a basis for supervising and inspecting work. It also provided workers and technicians with operating guidelines.
    Implement Soviet Expert Advice in Specific
        Operations
    Ideological work, raising questions, and three types of record books, although they ensured that difficult problems were comprehensively reflected to the Soviet experts in a timely manner from the perspective of the masses' thinking and management systems, and ensured that the situation of Soviet expert advice was grasped, they could not completely guarantee that the Soviet experts' suggestions would be implemented in actual operations without missing a single detail. The fourth experience of the Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team in implementing Soviet expert advice proves that the Soviet experts' suggestions must be incorporated into the construction measures plan, and the construction measures plan, which is mainly based on the Soviet experts' suggestions, must be used to specifically guide and organize construction in order to ensure that the Soviet experts' suggestions are implemented throughout the entire construction process. The construction measures plan is formulated before the start of each sub-project. Its content includes: project content, construction methods, quality standards, safety measures, supply of materials and tools, personnel organization, and project progress. The main basis for compiling the construction measures plan is the Soviet experts' suggestions on the above aspects. After the construction measures plan is formulated and discussed by the workers, it is written in large characters and posted on the construction site, and some are attached with charts. The characteristics of the construction measures plan are that it is specific, simple, and clear, easy for workers to understand, and it is posted on the site, where various bases for construction can be found at any time. It gives workers an extremely deep impression and urges them to carry out construction completely according to this construction measures plan. Implementing this construction measures plan is also implementing the Soviet experts' initial suggestions for this sub-project. The sub-project begins according to the construction measures plan. In this sub-project, every Soviet expert will discover some problems in our operations every day and will put forward many suggestions. Some of these suggestions are personally demonstrated to the workers by the Soviet experts or personally explained to the workers, and are implemented immediately. Some are told to the site director or technicians and need to be told to the workers to be implemented the next day. For the latter type of suggestion, it is stipulated that the technician is responsible for conveying it to the workers in the one hour before starting work the next day. In addition, after work every day, each group has a fifteen-minute small meeting to check whether all of the Soviet experts' suggestions that should be implemented on that day - including the construction measures plan, the Soviet experts' suggestions conveyed by the technicians that day, and the suggestions made by the Soviet experts in the operation - have been implemented. These systems ensure that the entire construction process of each sub-project can be carried out in accordance with the Soviet experts' suggestions. Organizing technical learning to ensure the implementation of Soviet expert advice The fifth experience of the Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team in implementing Soviet expert advice is that it is necessary to organize technical learning to improve the technical level of workers and technicians and to technically ensure the implementation of Soviet expert advice. The vast majority of the Soviet experts' suggestions are suggestions on construction technology. These suggestions are to impart us with the most advanced Soviet technical experience. To implement these suggestions, we must abandon the old methods and conscientiously learn the advanced Soviet technical experience. Without conscientious technical learning, the technical level of workers and technicians cannot be improved, and the Soviet experts' suggestions cannot be truly implemented.
    The time for technical learning is set for one hour before work every day. In addition, the trade union designates the one-hour trade union activity time on Wednesdays and Thursdays as "Soviet Advanced Experience Learning Day." The principle of technical learning is "learn while doing, learn what you do." The content of technical learning, after the start of construction, on the one hand, is to learn the above-mentioned construction measures plan and the Soviet experts' suggestions for the day's work, and on the other hand, it is to have the technicians explain the technical learning materials that are uniformly compiled based on the Soviet experts' suggestions and necessary theoretical knowledge, so that the workers gradually improve from learning simple construction measures to technical theory learning. This technical learning helps workers digest the Soviet experts' suggestions, deepens their understanding of the Soviet experts' suggestions, improves the workers' technical level, and ensures the implementation of the Soviet experts' suggestions. Many apprentices have learned some of the work of technical workers. For example, when apprentice Bai Zhengang first came, he thought that installation was probably carrying poles up when building houses. Now he has not only learned to use many tools for installing turbines, but also learned the work of technical workers such as measuring center lines, drilling holes, and threading wires. The technical learning of technicians is to organize Soviet experts to give lectures. A total of 42 lectures have been given by Soviet experts. A group of workers are organized to participate in the lectures. After the lectures, the technicians make transmissions to the workers.
      Master the Complete Set of Installation Technology
      Ensuring the implementation of Soviet expert advice makes it possible for the hydro-turbine generator to be completed according to the predetermined plan. Is this enough? The leading cadres of the Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team believed that this was not enough. They knew very well that their task was not only to install the generators here, but that the construction of other hydropower stations in China that was beginning, and the construction of hydropower stations on the Yellow River and the Yangtze River in the future, would all require them to install hydro-turbine generators. Therefore, a more important task was to master the complete set of installation technology to meet the needs of the country's hydropower construction undertaking.
      At this time, they also had the possibility of mastering the complete set of installation technology. In front of them were 617 Soviet experts' suggestions and 42 Soviet experts' lecture records. The research group of the Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team organized these valuable records into a compilation of six volumes of advanced Soviet hydro-turbine generator installation methods.
    At the same time, the leadership considered that the most complex part of many projects must be cultivated by specialized technicians to familiarize themselves with it. Therefore, a certain number of technical cadres were selected to systematically study with the guiding experts of this project and carry out professional training with goals. On the one hand, this ensures the completion of these most complex projects; on the other hand, it cultivates construction forces. Now, specialized personnel are familiar with the complex governor correction work and the latest high-voltage equipment installation technology.
    Results of Arduous Efforts
    The Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team made arduous efforts in implementing the Soviet experts' suggestions, sharply discovered problems, solved problems, grasped them tightly ring by ring, went deeper step by step, and made implementing the Soviet experts' suggestions the guiding ideology of leaders at all levels, the central link of enterprise management, the main content of the agenda, and the conscious action of the broad masses. The Party, the administration, the trade union, and the Communist Youth League, under unified thinking and goals, guaranteed the implementation of Soviet expert advice from all aspects. Although there are still shortcomings in the Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team's work in implementing Soviet expert advice, not all systems are implemented well, not all sites, sections, teams, and groups have implemented the above-mentioned systems, and not all people have implemented the Soviet experts' suggestions without missing a single detail, but in terms of its main aspects, the Northeast Hydroelectric Power Engineering Company's installation team can be called a model of implementing Soviet expert advice.

    贯彻苏联专家建议的范例
    范荣康
    巨大的收获
    我国著名的丰满水电站在一九五三年里安装了新的巨型自动化水轮发电机。这是我国第一个五年计划第一年里的一个巨大胜利。
    中央燃料工业部东北水力发电工程公司安装队在苏联专家的指导下，承包了这个崭新的复杂的工程。他们以超过伪满一倍半以上的速度，把新的巨型自动化水轮发电机安装起来，质量全部合乎苏联的国家标准。
    东北水力发电工程公司安装队的职工们原来是缺乏安装经验的，特别是这种巨型自动化水轮发电机，别说安装，连见都没有见过。职工中有一半是刚放下锄头的农民、转业军人和普通工人，有的连安装是怎么回事都搞不清楚，技术工人中有许多过去只修理过汽车上的马达等小型机件；名义上算是参加过安装的只有六个人，实际上他们只是递递工具，看过别人安装。就是这样的班子，现在已经掌握了世界上最先进的苏联安装技术。
    在东北水力发电工程公司安装队里，还珍藏着“发电机安装法”“水轮机安装法”“变压器快速安装法”“电厂设备试验法”等六本苏联先进安装方法的整套资料。这些资料是记录了苏联专家针对我国安装技术操作上的实际问题，根据苏联先进经验所提出的六百一十七条建议和讲课记录汇编而成的。它是苏联先进经验和我国具体情况相结合的典范，是我国电机安装的指南。
      水轮发电机进度迅速、质量良好地安装成功，一支掌握了苏联先进技术的安装队的成长，六本苏联先进经验和中国具体情况相结合的安装方法汇编，这就是东北水力发电工程公司安装队模范地贯彻苏联专家建议的巨大收获。
    做好贯彻苏联专家建议的思想工作
    东北水力发电工程公司安装队贯彻苏联专家建议的第一个经验，是认真地进行思想教育，扫除各种思想障碍，把贯彻苏联专家建议的口号变成群众的自觉行动，使苏联专家建议的贯彻，首先在群众思想上得到保证。
    在国外订货和苏联专家没有来到前，东北水力发电工程公司的领导干部们开了一次会，研究了行将来到的安装工程的各种不利的和有利的条件。不利的条件是缺乏安装经验，特别是缺乏安装这种巨型自动化机器的经验；有利的条件是安装工程将在苏联专家的直接指导下进行。因此就得出一个明确的结论：完成安装任务的关键，在于百分之百地贯彻苏联专家的建议，不折不扣地遵照苏联专家的指导去进行工作。领导干部们又研究了群众的思想。当时一部分群众的思想和领导的思想还有距离。他们只看到自己缺乏经验，却找不到贯彻苏联专家建议这条正确道路。阻碍他们找到这条道路的，有这样几种情况：一种情况是对苏联技术的优越性缺乏认识，他们看见苏联的大件机器焊接的很多，就怀疑苏联没有能力铸造大件机器，却不知道焊接正是苏联的先进经验，焊接部分的稳固远胜于铸造部分；他们看到苏联机器在某些地方不够精细，就说苏联机器不好，却不知道应该精细的地方一定精细、不必精细的地方不求精细，正是苏联机器的优越性。另一种情况是，有些技术人员和老工人迷信旧的经验，虽然觉得用旧方法安新机器不一定有把握，但并没有放弃旧的方法，认为：“苏联的也不会高多少。”领导干部们研究了这些思想情况，认为要在群众面前打开一条正确的道路，必须清除这些片面的、错误的认识。从一九四九年以来，苏联专家不断地来到丰满水电站，提供了整个丰满水电站的改建、恢复设计，修复了被洪水冲坏、到处是蜂窝，到处漏水的堤坝和被冻坏的溢流面，控制了猛洪，检修了运转八年的旧有发电机，提高了旧有发电机的出力。东北水力发电工程公司安装队就抓住这些生动事例，采用报告会、回忆会等方法，批判了对苏联和对苏联技术的怀疑。苏联设备运到后，又围绕清理国外订货，介绍苏联发电机的自动化、水轮机的构造简单、出力增加等优越性。这时候，群众已亲眼看到苏联机器的好处，开始体会到贯彻苏联专家建议的重要性。不过，这种认识在当时还不十分稳固，一部分人还抱着将信将疑的态度。
    苏联专家就在这种情况下来到工地。开工初期，就发生了震动全体职工的“轮辐套轴”的事情。轮辐和轴是发电机上的两个机件，施工中要把轮辐套在大轴上。最初，东北水力发电工程公司安装队根据伪满时的施工方法进行了准备，确定工期是二十一天。苏联专家来到后，全部否定了伪满的安装方法，提出新的建议，执行这个建议的结果，全部工程，包括准备工作在内，仅两天时间就完成了。
      工人们把轮辐套轴叫做“苏联专家的第一炮”，这第一炮教育了所有的人，用生动的事实打开了贯彻苏联专家建议的道路。领导上就抓住这个最生动的例子，教育职工认识贯彻苏联专家建议是决定工程好、快、省、安全的关键，号召职工认真贯彻苏联专家建议。
      可是，轮辐套轴并没有打动一直认为自己也懂得不少的某些技术人员的心。他们在执行苏联专家的建议中，惯于先用自己的办法，不行，再采用苏联专家的建议。例如，苏联专家建议导水翼分间隙应该由一边开始，但水轮机场技术员郑贤文认为苏联专家的建议有“考虑”的必要，就擅自决定由中间往两边分，结果造成返工。试验室有的技术员不照苏联专家建议的方法进行试验，一项工作返工三次。东北水力发电工程公司安装队认为技术人员是贯彻苏联专家建议的桥梁，他们熟悉图纸、规程，经常接近苏联专家，又直接负责在技术上指导工人施工，因此，端正技术人员对贯彻苏联专家建议的认识，是保证贯彻苏联专家建议的一个重要环节。于是，就抓住上述例子在技术人员中展开了思想批判，同时把积极钻研与积极贯彻苏联专家建议，帮助全卷线班工人学会苏联专家的建议，保证了卷线工程质量的技术员陈汉民当作典型，传播他的思想和贯彻苏联专家建议的经验，不久之后，技术人员对贯彻苏联专家建议的态度就有了显著的变化。
    对苏联和对苏联技术的怀疑，是贯彻苏联专家建议的直接思想障碍；但并不是全部的思想障碍。阻碍苏联专家建议贯彻的，还有各种不同的思想情况。一种是积极学习苏联专家的建议，但并不积极贯彻苏联专家的建议，这种人认为“学好本领，到处吃得开”，企图把苏联专家的建议当作私有财产，记得多，讲得少，往自己本子上记得多，往公家本子上记得少。工人们叫这种人为“苏联专家建议的贪污犯”。另一种是缺乏实事求是的思想作风，对执行苏联专家的建议明明没有把握，却不把实际情况和困难提出来研究，反而满口答应，结果苏联专家的建议还是贯彻不下去。这些情况说明，技术人员和干部中某些不良的思想作风，也是阻碍着苏联专家建议的贯彻的。东北水力发电工程公司安装队一方面抓住苏联专家实事求是、认真负责和忘我的工作作风与国际主义精神，向职工进行了正面的思想教育，一方面又在一定的场合，对上述犯错误的人员进行了教育，帮助他们认识自己的错误。
    对党员和团员，东北水力发电工程公司安装队提出了更高的要求。要求党员和团员认识学习苏联是党的政治路线，是考核每一个党员和团员政治品质的标尺之一，要求每一个党员和团员首先保证苏联专家建议的贯彻。
      东北水力发电工程公司安装队贯彻苏联专家建议的思想工作，不仅是针对着不同对象，不同时期的不同思想情况，不仅善于抓住最典型、最生动的事例，而且注意围绕每个时期的主要工作和领导上的主要要求去进行。例如准备工作阶段，清理国外到货时，就引导群众认识苏联机器的优越性，提出
  “爱护来自苏联的机器，不损坏一个小零件”，推动了准备工作的进行。在进行安装的初期，提出的口号是：“认真贯彻苏联专家建议，在安装过程中把技术普遍提高一级”，到安装的后期，又提出了：
  “由不懂到懂，由不熟练到熟练，由熟练到精通，求得精通一门专业知识”。这样不同时期的不同口号，都围绕着贯彻苏联专家建议的中心思想，提出了明确的要求，动员了每一个人。
      提出问题来
    苏联专家没有来到前，东北水力发电工程公司安装队进行了部分机件的预装配工作。预装配的收获之一，是发现少数机件接合缝不严及其他一些问题。这些问题都被记录下来。苏联专家来到后，马上就得到了这个资料。苏联专家很赞许这项工作，因为这份资料提出了安装中机件本身的疑难问题，使得苏联专家能及时提出建议，迅速处理，及早开工。东北水力发电工程公司安装队贯彻苏联专家建议的第二个经验正证明了：全面地、系统地提出情况，提出问题，是取得苏联专家建议和贯彻苏联专家建议的一项重要工作。
      不过，正式开工后，情况就变得更复杂了。许多分项工程齐头并进，一个一个工序紧相衔接，数百名工人日夜操作。要在这许多分项工程、工序开始之前预见到所有的问题，是不可能的，但是，在每一个分项工程开始前，周密地考虑可能发生的问题，提出疑难，听取专家的建议，却十分必要。一开始的时候，这项工作没有做得很好。有的问题漏了，有的考虑不周、问得不全，有的索性不主动考虑问题，事事问苏联专家。
    这时，领导上为了建立和苏联专家谈话的秩序，防止乱问、重复问等现象，建立了和苏联专家谈话的制度，各场指定专人和苏联专家谈话。这个制度是必要的，但群众对这制度提出一个问题：
  “不让我们找专家，我们有疑难怎么办？”
    事实很明显，工程本身和群众，都要求订立一种制度，以便于不是临时抱佛脚地，而是事先就能全面地把群众所感到的实际操作上的疑难，提到苏联专家的面前，听取苏联专家的建议。于是，就出现了这样一种制度，在每个分项工程开始前，由场长、技术员，有的并吸收班、组长以上的干部来共同研究即将开始的分项工程里有那些疑难问题，全盘考虑施工方法，质量标准，保安措施，人员组织，工具和材料供应等各方面的问题，根据这些疑难和考虑的问题去和苏联专家谈话，听取苏联专家的建议；根据苏联专家的建议和苏联专家所同意的我们的各项意见，编成施工措施计划。再把施工措施计划交给工人讨论，假如工人不明白，技术人员无法解答，或者工人提出另外的问题，便再请苏联专家来作解释。这个制度保证了比较周全地向苏联专家反映问题，大大减少了施工中临时抱佛脚的现象。
      掌握苏联专家建议的情况
    东北水力发电工程公司安装队贯彻苏联专家建议的第三个经验是：必须一日一日、一级一级地掌握苏联专家建议的情况，从企业管理上来保证苏联专家建议的贯彻。东北水力发电工程公司安装队用以掌握苏联专家建议情况的，是三种记录簿。
    最初出现的是翻译人员的口译记录簿。东北水力发电工程公司副经理兼安装队队长王月轩曾这样想：来到安装队的苏联专家是十八名，他们每天在现场工作，提出许多建议，贯彻这些建议正是完成安装任务的关键。不掌握苏联专家建议的情况能行吗？于是，王月轩就向翻译人员提出一项要求：每天记录苏联专家的建议交给他。翻译科根据这个要求，制订了口译记录簿，规定填写的内容是：时间、建议内容、谁建议和向谁建议。每个翻译人员每天填写一张，签名后交翻译科，汇总给队长。口译记录簿实行的最初几天，就证明它是十分必要的。王月轩从这些简单的记录中掌握了苏联专家提供了那些建议，而这些建议恰恰反映了工程上各方面的主要问题和应该怎样去解决。这就使领导干部心中有数，督促和检查工作有了最好的依据。口译记录簿实行到后来，又增加了一项规定：翻译人员填完后，交给和苏联专家谈话的人阅读签字，表示他已完全明了这个建议，负责执行，同时经过和苏联专家谈话的人阅读后，也可以避免记录中的技术错误。
    口译记录簿只解决了队长掌握苏联专家建议的情况和督促与检查苏联专家建议贯彻情况这一问题，当时各个现场和股、室并没有记录簿。在场股 一级，苏联专家的建议只记在技术人员的小本子上，场股长无法掌握，技术人员免不了遗忘，这就成为贯彻苏联专家建议中的漏洞。在试验室，苏联专家建议做一把活动梯子，避免往仪器架上取仪器时损坏仪器，这个建议拖了很长的时间没有执行，不断发生损坏仪器的现象。原因之一就是没有人记录这个建议，没有人督促执行。针对这种情况，订立了场一级的登记簿，由场长和技术员负责填写苏联专家的建议。
    第三种记录簿是小组登记簿。在建立小组登记簿以前，发电机场发生过一件事。这一天，陈斌小组做铁片堆积紧螺丝的工作，螺丝很大、很长，用大锤打，打到打不动的时候，就认为已经紧了，就请苏联专家来检查。苏联专家用手在螺丝帽上敲敲，用耳朵贴上听听，就检查出是不是真的拧紧了，没有紧，就用大锤打几下，再用钳子紧紧。苏联专家教会了陈斌小组使用这个检查和紧螺丝的方法。下班时，陈斌在口头上向接班班长交代了苏联专家的这个建议。可是，第二天，陈斌小组的工人们上班时，发现班上的工人正在等苏联专家来检查螺丝，完全不知道苏联专家已经有了检查和紧螺丝的建议，而且已经亲自教会他们做了。再一追查，原来因为没有文字记录，两个交接班，苏联专家的建议就给丢了。当时，工人贯彻苏联专家建议的热情很高，有的说：“专家一句话，够我们想半天；专家一个建议，我们半个月也想不出来。”“点滴不漏地贯彻苏联专家建议”成为群众的普遍要求。小组登记簿的建立，保证了苏联专家的建议不因交接班而中断执行。
    这三种记录簿在东北水力发电工程公司安装队贯彻苏联专家的建议中，起了很大的作用。它使各级领导掌握了苏联专家建议的情况，了解了工程中的关键问题和解决的方案，有了督促和检查工作的依据。它也使工人和技术人员得到了操作的指南。
    把苏联专家建议贯彻到具体
        操作中去
    思想工作，提出问题来，和三种记录簿，虽然从群众思想上，从管理制度上，保证了及时向苏联专家全面地反映疑难问题，保证了掌握苏联专家建议的情况，但并不能完全保证苏联专家的建议点滴不漏地贯彻到实际操作中去。东北水力发电工程公司安装队贯彻苏联专家建议的第四个经验证明，必须把苏联专家的建议编入施工措施计划，用以苏联专家建议为主要依据的施工措施计划去具体指导与组织施工，才能保证苏联专家的建议贯彻到全部施工过程中去。施工措施计划是在每一个分项工程开始前订立的。它的内容包括：工程内容，施工方法，质量标准，保安措施，材料和工具的供应，人员组织和工程进度。编制施工措施计划的主要根据就是苏联专家对上述各个方面的建议。施工措施计划订好并经工人讨论后，用大字书写，贴在施工现场，有的并附以图表。施工措施计划的特点是具体、简单、明了，工人容易看懂，并且是贴在现场上，随时可以从这里找到施工的各种根据。它给工人极其深刻的印象，督促工人完全根据这个施工措施计划进行施工。贯彻了这个施工措施计划，也就是贯彻了苏联专家对这个分项工程的最初各项建议。分项工程按照施工措施计划开始了，在这个分项工程里，每一个苏联专家每一天都会发现我们操作上的一些问题，都会提出许多建议，这些建议里，有一些是苏联专家亲自做给工人看，或者是亲自讲给工人听，马上就执行了的；有一些是向场长或技术员讲了，需要告诉工人第二天执行的。对后一种建议，规定在第二天上班前的一小时里，由技术员负责向工人传达。此外，在每天下班之后，各小组又有十五分钟的小会，来检查当天应该执行的苏联专家的建议——包括施工措施计划，技术员当天传达的苏联专家的建议和在操作中苏联专家提出的建议，是不是全部都执行了。这些制度保证了每个分项工程的全部施工过程都能按照苏联专家的建议去进行。组织技术学习保证苏联专家建议的贯彻东北水力发电工程公司安装队贯彻苏联专家建议的第五个经验是，必须组织技术学习，提高工人和技术人员的技术水平，从技术上保证苏联专家建议的贯彻。苏联专家建议的绝大部分是对施工技术的建议，这些建议是给我们传授苏联最先进的技术经验。执行这些建议，就要放弃旧的方法，就要认真地学会苏联的先进技术经验。没有认真的技术学习，工人和技术人员的技术水平不能提高，苏联专家的建议还是不能真正贯彻。
    技术学习的时间规定在每天上班前的一小时里。另外，工会并把每星期三、四一小时的工会活动时间订为“苏联先进经验学习日”。技术学习的原则是“边做边学，做啥学啥”。技术学习的内容，在开工后，一方面是学习上述施工措施计划和苏联专家对当天工作的建议，另一方面是由技术人员讲解根据苏联专家建议和必要的理论知识等统一汇编的技术学习教材，使工人由学习简单的施工措施，逐渐提高到技术理论学习。这种技术学习帮助工人消化了苏联专家的建议，加深了对苏联专家建议的体会，提高了工人的技术水平，保证了苏联专家建议的贯彻。许多徒工学会了一些技术工人的工作。例如徒工白珍刚来时以为安装大概是盖房子的时候扛杆子往上安，现在他不仅学会了使用安装水轮机的许多工具，而且学会了测量中心线、钻眼、套丝等技术工人的工作。技术人员的技术学习，是组织苏联专家讲课。先后共请苏联专家讲课四十二次。在讲课中并组织一部分工人参加。讲后，由技术人员向工人作传达。
      掌握全套的安装技术
      保证了苏联专家建议的贯彻，水轮发电机有可能按照预定的计划完工。这就够了吗？东北水力发电工程公司安装队的领导干部们认为这是不够的。他们很清楚地知道，自己的任务不只是安装这里的发电机，正在开始的我国其他水电站的建设，未来的黄河、长江的水电站建设，都需要他们去安装水轮发电机。因此，更重要的任务是掌握全套的安装技术，适应国家水力发电建设事业的需要。
      这时候，他们也已经具备了掌握全套安装技术的可能。放在他们面前的，有六百一十七条苏联专家的建议和四十二次苏联专家的讲课记录。东北水力发电工程公司安装队研究组根据这些宝贵的记录，整理成了六本全套水轮发电机先进安装方法的资料汇编。
    同时，领导上考虑到许多工程中最复杂的部分，必须培养专门的技术人员去熟悉它。于是选派了一定数量的技术干部专门跟随这项工程的指导专家系统地学习，有目标地进行专业培养。一方面使这些最复杂的工程的完成有了保证；另一方面培养了建设力量。现在，复杂的调速机校正工作，最新的高压设备安装技术，都已有专人熟悉了。
    艰苦努力的结果
    东北水力发电工程公司安装队在贯彻苏联专家的建议中作了艰苦的努力，尖锐地发现问题，解决问题，一环一环地抓紧，一步一步地深入，使贯彻苏联专家建议成为各级领导的指导思想，成为企业管理的中心环节，成为议事日程的主要内容，成为广大群众的自觉行动。党、行政、工会、青年团在统一的思想和目标下，从各个方面来保证了苏联专家建议的贯彻。虽然，东北水力发电工程公司安装队贯彻苏联专家建议的工作也还有缺点，并不是所有的制度都执行得很好，并不是所有的场、股、班、组都执行了上述的制度，并不是所有的人都点滴不漏地贯彻了苏联专家的建议，但就其主要方面来说，东北水力发电工程公司安装队称得上是贯彻苏联专家建议的范例。
