On the Kang-Tibetan Plateau, the National Cadre School of the Tibetan Autonomous Region of Xikang Province has trained a group of Tibetan cadres with certain working abilities. They are distributed in the cities and villages of the autonomous region, closely connected with the broad masses, and actively working for the people of all ethnic groups.

The Autonomous Region's National Cadre School is located outside Kangding City, the capital of the autonomous region, by a clear stream. The students in the school are mostly Tibetan. Currently, there are more than 600 students of Tibetan, Han, Yi and other ethnic groups studying in the school. Since the school was founded in 1951, it has had more than 2,000 graduates, of whom more than 300 have continued their studies, and the rest have been assigned to various places to participate in various construction works.

The state gives deep preferential treatment to students in the school. Students' food, accommodation, clothing, stationery, etc. are all provided by the government. The courses students study in the school include ethnic policies, Chinese, Tibetan, etc. In addition to Han teachers, there are also Tibetan teachers in the school. Gongga, a famous Tibetan scholar in his sixties, was also gladly hired to teach at the school. The relationship between teachers and students in the school is very close. In addition to patiently teaching and helping in their studies, the teachers also care about the students' daily life, such as bathing and haircuts; on cold snowy nights, they often go to the student dormitories to cover the students with quilts, and the students are greatly moved by these cares.

The opening of the National Cadre School has met the needs of the people. Every year, many outstanding Tibetan and other ethnic youths, entrusted by the people and holding great aspirations, come to the school from their distant hometowns to study. Wuji, a nineteen-year-old Yi shepherd girl, lives in a remote mountain area far from the school. When she decided to come to the school to study, her mother ground a bag of flour for her overnight, steamed steamed buns, and washed her clothes clean. Before leaving, she told her to study hard after arriving at the school. She walked alone for half a month, crossed four mountains, and waded through many rivers before finally arriving at the school. Pingcuo Dorje, a Tibetan youth from Daocheng County, traveled more than a thousand miles from his hometown to the school. When he left his hometown, the villagers all came to see him off and hoped that he would return to work for everyone after completing his studies. In order to realize the entrustment of the people and their own wishes, the students all study hard, even in the cold winter, they have not stopped attending classes and discussions. The students also automatically seize the spare time to discuss and review their lessons. Because of their efforts, many study models have emerged in each study summary.

The ethnic youths who graduated from the school have become a new force in the Tibetan Autonomous Region. They have been assigned to various posts, and they can faithfully implement ethnic policies and become good cadres loved by the masses, and some have become leading cadres. Ze Xi, a Tibetan female youth who graduated from the first class of the school, is now the deputy leader of the work team in the first district of Garze County. She once climbed over snow-capped mountains tirelessly to help the returning people settle down and produce. Aze, a student who graduated from the fourth class, is now working in Xinlong County. In order not to delay the farming season, he often travels back and forth on the mountain roads in the deep mountains day and night to distribute agricultural tools to the farmers on time.

Now, this cadre school is expanding its school buildings, increasing school equipment and books, and preparing to receive more Tibetan and other ethnic youths to study at the school.

    康藏高原上的民族干部学校
    新华社记者　杨居人
    在康藏高原上，西康省藏族自治区民族干部学校，已培养了一批具有一定工作能力的藏族干部，他们分布在自治区的城市和乡村，密切联系着广大群众，积极地为各族人民工作着。
    自治区民族干部学校，设在自治区首府康定城外，在一条清净的溪流边。学校学生以藏族为最多。现在校内学习的有藏、汉、彝等族的学生六百多名。学校自一九五一年开办以来，已有两千多名毕业生，其中除三百多名继续升学外，其余的都已分配到各地参加各种建设工作。
    国家对于在校学生，都给予深厚的优待。学生们的膳食、住宿、服装、文具等，一律由政府供给。学生们在校学习的课程，有民族政策、汉文、藏文等，学校里除汉族教员外，还有藏族教员。六十多岁的藏族著名学者贡加，也欣然受聘到校任教。学校的师生关系很密切。教员们除在学习上耐心地讲授和帮助外，还关心学生们的洗澡、理发等日常生活；在严寒的雪夜，经常到学生宿舍给学生盖被子，学生们都为这些照顾受到很大的感动。
    民族干部学校的开办，满足了人们的要求。每年都有许多优秀的藏族和其他各族青年，受了人民的嘱托，抱着远大的愿望，从遥远的家乡，来到学校学习。十九岁的彝族牧羊姑娘乌吉，家住在离学校很远的深山里。当她决定来校学习的时候，她的母亲连夜给她磨了一袋面，蒸了馒头，并给她洗净了衣服，临别时，并嘱咐她到校后好好学习。她一个人走了半个月，翻过四座大山，涉过许多江河，终于来到学校。稻城县的藏族青年凭错多吉，从家乡到学校共走了一千多里路。当他离开家乡时，村里人都去送行，并希望他学成后回去为大家办事。学生们为了实现人民的嘱托和自己的愿望，他们都努力学习，即使在严寒的冬天，也未停止过上课和讨论。同学们还自动抓住空隙时间，用来讨论和复习功课。由于他们的努力，每次学习总结，都出现了许多学习模范。
    学校毕业的各族青年，已成为藏族自治区内一批新生的力量。他们被分配到各个岗位上去，都能忠实地执行民族政策，成为群众喜爱的好干部，有些已成为领导干部了。从学校第一期毕业的学生藏族女青年泽喜，现在甘孜县第一区担任工作队的副队长，她曾经不辞辛劳地爬越雪山，帮助返乡的人们安家生产。第四期毕业的学生阿泽，现在在新龙县工作。他为了不误农时，在发放农具工作中，往往一个人白天夜晚往来在深山里的山道上，将农具按时发到农民手里。
    现在，这所干部学校正在扩建校舍，增加校具与图书，准备接收更多的藏族及其他各族青年到校学习。
