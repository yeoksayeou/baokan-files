    Middle Eastern Newspapers
    Denounce US-Pakistan Military Negotiations
    [Xinhua News Agency, January 8th] Middle Eastern newspapers continue to criticize the actively planned US-Pakistan military treaty.
    In Afghanistan, the Kabul "Friendship Daily" recently published a commentary stating:
  “As long as foreign military bases appear on the territory of a country, that country will become a colony.” The commentary pointed out: “Such a fate also awaits Pakistan if it grants military bases to the United States.”
    In Egypt, the Cairo "Al-Ahram" weekly recently published an editorial stating:
  “We feel pained when we see Pakistan requesting military aid from the United States. Because, as Nehru said, when American weapons, equipment, and supplies are continuously transported in, Pakistan will become an American military and commercial base.”
    In Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, many newspapers published comments attacking the US-Pakistan military alliance on New Year's Day, 1954. The "Al-Alam" newspaper published a commentary stating: "The noble attitude of India and the people of other countries located in this region, including the people of Pakistan, has forced Muhammad Ali (Prime Minister of Pakistan) and Ghulam Muhammad (Governor-General of Pakistan) to deny that such talks have ever taken place. This denial actually indicates that the talks are in progress. Therefore, now we can see Zafrullah Khan (Foreign Minister of Pakistan) is acting in accordance with the instructions of Ghulam Muhammad and Dulles, in order to enable Washington to achieve its goals." "Al Siyasa" newspaper said in a dispatch: "This treaty will put Pakistan and its people at risk of suffering great harm, so the people of Pakistan will not accept any such treaty." An article in "Sada Al-Sha’ab" opposing the US-Pakistan military alliance pointed out that the Asian people’s clearly expressed desire to get rid of imperialism "is a reality that Dulles cannot ignore" and "cannot be erased or burned by Senator McCarthy."

    中东各国报纸
    抨击美巴军事谈判
    【新华社八日讯】中东国家报纸继续抨击正在积极策划中的美巴军事条约。
    在阿富汗，喀布尔“友谊报”最近发表评论说：
  “只要外国军事基地在那一国的领土上出现，就会使那个国家变为一个殖民地。”评论指出：“这样的命运也在等待着巴基斯坦，如果它把军事基地给予美国的话。”
    在埃及，开罗“晨报”周刊最近发表社论说：
  “在我们看到巴基斯坦向美国要求军事援助的时候，我们觉得痛心。因为，正如尼赫鲁所说的，当美国武器、装备、供应物资源源运到时，巴基斯坦便会变成美国的军事与商业基地。”
    在伊拉克首都巴格达，许多报纸都在一九五四年元旦发表抨击美巴军事同盟的言论。“旗帜报”发表评论说：“印度和位于这个区域内的，包括巴基斯坦人民在内的，其他国家人民的高尚的态度，已迫使穆罕默德·阿里（巴基斯坦总理）和吴拉姆·穆罕默德（巴基斯坦总督）出来否认曾经有过这种商谈。这种否认实际上表明了商谈是在进行中。因此，现在，我们可以看到查弗鲁拉汗（巴基斯坦外交部长）正在遵照吴拉姆·穆罕默德和杜勒斯的指示，进行活动，为的是使华盛顿能够达到它的目的。”“西雅萨报”在一条电讯中说：“这个条约将使巴基斯坦及其人民有遭受很大危害的危险，所以巴基斯坦人民是不会接受任何这样的条约的。”“人民之声报”发表的一篇反对美巴军事同盟的文章指出：亚洲人民明白表示的摆脱帝国主义的愿望，“是杜勒斯所不能够忽视的现实”，“也不是参议员麦卡锡所能磨灭或焚毁的”。
