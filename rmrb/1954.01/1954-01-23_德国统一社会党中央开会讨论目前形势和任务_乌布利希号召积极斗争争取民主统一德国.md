Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, January 18th: According to a TASS report from Berlin on January 17th, "Neues Deutschland" reported that the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party and the first secretaries of the party organizations at the district and local levels, as well as the Free German Youth League, held a three-day meeting in Berlin.

    Walter Ulbricht, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, delivered a report on "The Current Situation and the Tasks of the Party." He analyzed the work carried out by the party since the Sixteenth Plenary Session of the Central Committee and put forward the party's current tasks. Ulbricht emphasized that active political struggle for the democratic unification of Germany should become the main content of the party organizations' preparations for the Fourth Party Congress. In 1954, all residents of the German Democratic Republic should intensify their struggle to restore the establishment of a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany. In discussing the party's tasks, Ulbricht pointed out that it is necessary to continue to explain the issue of easing international tensions to the residents. He said that the movement to strive for a democratic and unified Germany requires making the struggle against the "European Army" treaty and against the reviving West German militarism the content of all the party's work, because the aim of the Bonn and Paris military treaties is to oppose the easing of international tensions. Ulbricht then said: The party's second task is to expand and strengthen the party's ties with the masses and increase the activity of party organizations; the party's third task is to strengthen unity within the party. Ulbricht also called on everyone to strengthen attention to trade union work and youth work. Eighteen people spoke during the discussion of Ulbricht's report.

    The Secretary of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, Tsiller, gave a report on "Implementing the Resolution on Further Improving Workers' Labor and Living Conditions and on the Rights of Trade Unions." He pointed out the great significance of the German Democratic Republic government's resolution on improving workers' working conditions and material living conditions. He said that it is now particularly necessary to make concern for people the center of the party's work. Ranki, Minister of Trade, Supply and Light Industry of the Central Committee of the German Socialist Unity Party, gave a report on the implementation of the German Democratic Republic government's resolution on increasing and improving the production of necessities and on some trade issues. He pointed out that in the first seven months since the implementation of the new policy in the German Democratic Republic, the purchasing power of residents has already increased. The 1954 national economic plan stipulates the adoption of further measures to increase the purchasing power of the working people of the German Democratic Republic and improve their living conditions.

    On the last day of the meeting, Karl Schirdewan gave a report on the party's tasks in improving youth work. Finally, Ulbricht delivered the closing speech.

    德国统一社会党中央开会讨论目前形势和任务
    乌布利希号召积极斗争争取民主统一德国
    【新华社十八日讯】据塔斯社柏林十七日讯：
  “新德意志报”报道，德国统一社会党中央委员会和各专区和地方党组织及自由德国青年联盟的第一书记，在柏林举行了三天会议。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会第一书记瓦尔特·乌布利希在会上作了关于“目前形势和党的任务”的报告。他分析了自党中央委员会第十六次全体会议以来党所进行的工作，并提出了党在当前的任务。乌布利希着重指出，为德国的民主统一而进行积极的政治斗争，应当成为党组织筹备党的第四次代表大会的工作的主要内容。一九五四年，德意志民主共和国全体居民应当加紧为恢复建立统一、和平、民主的德国而斗争。乌布利希在谈到党的任务时指出，必须就缓和国际紧张局势的问题向居民继续进行解释。他说，争取民主统一德国的运动，要求把反对“欧洲军”条约和反对正在复活的西德军国主义的斗争作为党全部工作的内容，因为波恩和巴黎军事条约的目的是要反对缓和国际紧张局势。乌布利希接着说：党的第二项任务是扩大和加强党与群众的联系，提高党组织的积极性；党的第三项任务是加强党内的团结。乌布利希并号召大家加强注意工会工作和青年工作。在讨论乌布利希的报告时有十八人发言。
    德国统一社会党中央委员会书记齐勒作了“实现关于进一步改善工人的劳动与生活条件以及关于工会权利的决议”的报告。他指出德意志民主共和国政府关于改善工人工作条件和物质生活状况的决议的巨大意义。他说，现在特别需要把对人的关心作为党工作的中心。德国统一社会党中央委员会贸易、供应和轻工业部部长兰基作了关于实现德意志民主共和国政府增加及改进必需品生产和就一些贸易问题所作的决议的报告。他指出，在德意志民主共和国实行新方针的头七个月以来，居民的购买力就已经提高了。一九五四年的国民经济计划规定采取进一步提高德意志民主共和国劳动人民购买力和改善他们的生活条件的措施。
    会议的最后一天，卡尔·希德万作了关于党在改进青年工作方面的任务的报告。最后，乌布利希致会议闭幕词。
