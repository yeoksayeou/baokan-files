    Developing the Languages and Scripts of All Ethnic Minorities
    Ding Li
    Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, the policies and tasks of our Party in dealing with ethnic issues have been to consolidate the unity of the motherland and the solidarity of all ethnic groups, gradually develop the political, economic, and cultural life of all ethnic groups, eliminate the de facto inequalities among ethnic groups left over by history, help backward ethnic groups catch up with advanced ethnic groups, and jointly transition to a socialist society. To achieve this great goal, we firmly advocate developing the languages and scripts of ethnic minorities as tools for developing ethnic cultures.
    Stalin taught us: "Only under the conditions of the development of national culture can backward nations truly participate in the cause of socialist construction." (Report at the Sixteenth Congress of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks)) The "Resolution on the Party's Urgent Tasks in the National Question," adopted by the Tenth Congress of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1921 based on the outline proposed by Stalin, put forward four measures to help the laboring masses of ethnic minorities catch up with the central regions of Russia: (1) develop and consolidate their Soviet statehood, in a form adapted to the national life conditions of these ethnic groups; (2) develop and consolidate their courts, administrative organs, economic organs, and organs of power, using their own languages and composed of local people familiar with the life and psychology of local residents; (3) develop their newspapers, schools, theaters, clubs, and general cultural and educational institutions using their own languages; (4) extensively establish and develop a network of general education and vocational and technical training classes and schools using their own languages. Obviously, the Soviet Union attached great importance to the development of national languages and scripts.
    The core issue of our country's basic policy for resolving ethnic issues—the policy of ethnic regional autonomy—is the nationalization of autonomous organs. To achieve nationalization, it is necessary to use and develop ethnic languages and scripts.
    The Party and the People's Government attach great importance to the development of ethnic minority languages and scripts. The Common Program of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the Outline for the Implementation of Ethnic Regional Autonomy of the People's Republic of China, and other documents related to ethnic policies all explicitly stipulate that all ethnic minorities have the freedom and right to use and develop their own languages and scripts. According to the decision of the Government Administration Council of the Central People's Government, the National Languages and Scripts Research and Guidance Committee was established within the Cultural and Educational Committee of the Government Administration Council to guide and organize research on the languages and scripts of ethnic minorities, help ethnic groups without written languages create written languages, and help ethnic groups with incomplete written languages gradually improve and enrich their written languages. The Institute of Linguistics of the Chinese Academy of Sciences is also systematically conducting investigations and research on ethnic minority languages. With the help of the People's Government, the Liangshan Yi people had their own new script in 1951. The First National Ethnic Education Conference convened by the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government stipulated that all courses in primary and secondary schools of ethnic groups with existing common written languages must be taught in the languages of those ethnic groups. In order to instill new culture and new knowledge into ethnic minorities, the People's Government has also translated and published a large number of books and periodicals in ethnic minority languages, established newspapers in ethnic minority languages, and developed radio and film industries using ethnic minority languages. This series of measures plays an important role in promoting the development of the political, economic, cultural, and educational undertakings of ethnic minorities.
    Some comrades do not have a sufficient understanding of the necessity of developing ethnic languages and scripts, believing that it is enough to let ethnic minorities learn Chinese. The reason given is that ethnic minority languages and scripts are backward, or that developing ethnic languages and scripts will simultaneously develop narrow-minded nationalist sentiments. These comrades have forgotten or do not understand Stalin's teaching: "Only by using their own languages can millions of people make progress in cultural, political, and economic development." (The National Question and Leninism) Therefore, this kind of thinking is completely wrong and should be corrected.
    Developing the languages and scripts of ethnic minorities is a complex task that requires thorough investigation and research, the formulation of feasible plans, and gradual implementation.
    During the period when our country is gradually transitioning to socialism, construction undertakings in all fields require the active participation of people of all ethnic groups, contributing their own strength. To achieve this great goal, we must earnestly develop the languages and scripts of all ethnic groups, so as to rapidly improve the cultural and knowledge level of the people of all ethnic groups and free them from the backward and ignorant state of the past.

    发展各少数民族的语言文字
    丁黎
    中华人民共和国成立以后，我们党在民族问题方面的政策和任务，是巩固祖国的统一和各民族的团结，逐渐发展各民族的政治、经济和文化，消灭历史上遗留下来的各民族间事实上的不平等，帮助落后的民族提高到先进民族的水平，共同过渡到社会主义社会。为达到这一伟大目的，我们就坚决主张发展少数民族的语言文字，作为发展民族文化的工具。
    斯大林教导我们说：“只有在民族文化发展的条件之下，才能使落后的民族真正地参加社会主义建设的事业。”（在联共（布）第十六次代表大会上的报告）一九二一年俄国共产党（布）第十次代表大会根据斯大林提出的提纲所通过的“论党在民族问题方面的迫切任务”中，曾提出四项帮助少数民族劳动群众赶上俄罗斯中央地区的办法：（一）发展并巩固他们的苏维埃国家性，其形式须与这些民族的民族生活条件相适应；（二）发展并巩固他们的使用本族语言的、由熟悉当地居民生活和心理的当地人组成的法庭、行政机关、经济机关、政权机关；
  （三）发展他们的使用本族语言的报刊、学校、戏院、俱乐部及一般文化教育机关；（四）广泛地开办和发展使用本族语言的普通教育性质的和职业技术性质的训练班和学校网。显然，苏联对于发展民族语文是十分重视的。
    我国解决民族问题的基本政策——民族区域自治政策的核心问题，就是自治机关的民族化。要民族化，就必须使用和发展民族的语言文字。
    党和人民政府对少数民族语文的发展是非常重视的。中国人民政治协商会议共同纲领、中华人民共和国民族区域自治实施纲要和其他有关民族政策的文件中，都明文规定了各少数民族有使用和发展本民族语言文字的自由和权利。根据中央人民政府政务院的决定，政务院文化教育委员会内设立了民族语言文字研究指导委员会，负责指导和组织关于少数民族语言文字的研究工作，帮助没有文字的民族创造文字，帮助文字不完备的民族逐渐改进和充实他们的文字。中国科学院语言研究所也正有计划地对少数民族语言进行调查研究。凉山彝族在人民政府的帮助下，一九五一年就有了自己的新文字。中央人民政府教育部召开的第一次全国民族教育会议上规定：凡有现行通用文字的民族，小学和中学的各科课程必须用本民族语文教学。为了向少数民族灌输新的文化，新的知识，人民政府还用少数民族文字翻译出版了大量的书刊，创立少数民族文字的报纸，并发展了使用少数民族语文的广播、电影事业。这一系列的措施，对少数民族的政治、经济、文化教育事业的发展，起着重要的推动作用。
    有些同志对于发展民族语文的必要性认识不足，以为只让少数民族学习汉语汉文就行了。理由是少数民族语文落后，或者是说发展了民族语文就会同时发展了狭隘的民族主义情绪。这些同志忘记了或不懂得斯大林对我们的教导：“千百万人民群众只有使用本民族语言才能在文化、政治和经济发展方面获得进步。”（民族问题与列宁主义）因此这种想法也就是完全错误的，应该加以纠正。
    发展少数民族的语言文字是一项复杂的工作，需要经过周密的调查研究，分别订出可行的计划，逐步地进行。
    在我们国家逐步向社会主义过渡的时期，各方面的建设事业都需要各族人民积极参加，贡献出自己的力量。为达成这一伟大目的，我们必须认真发展各民族自己的语文，借以迅速提高各民族人民的文化知识水平，使各民族人民脱离过去的落后愚昧状态。
