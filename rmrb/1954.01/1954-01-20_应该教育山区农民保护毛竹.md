    Mountain Farmers Should Be Educated to Protect Moso Bamboo
    Readers Luo Yun and Hu Pei from Xiangshan County, Zhejiang Province, write: Our township, Bajiao, is a mountainous area rich in Moso bamboo. Many mountain residents rely on bamboo weaving for a living. In recent years, mountain products have sold well, and the living standards of mountain residents have greatly improved. However, some farmers only care about immediate interests and do not plan for the long term, indiscriminately felling Moso bamboo, which affects its production. According to experienced farmers, Moso bamboo should be felled after five years of growth to ensure "mother and child are strong;" if bamboo under three years old is felled, the quality of the new bamboo will be very poor.
    Why does indiscriminate felling of Moso bamboo occur? The main reason is that the local Party and government leading bodies have neglected the characteristics of mountain production, focusing only on leading agricultural production while ignoring the indiscriminate felling of bamboo forests by mountain farmers.
    For the long-term interests of mountain farmers, we suggest that the Bajiao Township People's Government in Xiangshan County should educate mountain residents not to indiscriminately fell Moso bamboo and dig up winter bamboo shoots, and should do a good job in digging mountains and applying winter fertilizer to bamboo mountains to improve the yield and quality of Moso bamboo.

### 应该教育山区农民保护毛竹

    应该教育山区农民保护毛竹
    浙江象山县读者罗云、胡佩来信：我县芭蕉乡是山区，全乡盛产毛竹，很多山民以编打竹器为业。近几年来山货畅销，山民生活得到了很大的改善。可是有些农民只顾眼前利益，不作长远打算，滥伐毛竹，影响了毛竹的生产。按照老农经验：毛竹在生长五年以后砍伐，才能“娘大儿大”；假使砍伐三年以下的毛竹，那么新生出来的毛竹质量就很差。
    为什么会发生滥伐毛竹的现象呢？主要原因是当地党政领导机关忽视了山区生产的特点，只重视领导农业生产，而对山农滥伐竹林的情况不加过问。
    为了山区农民的长远利益，我们建议象山县芭蕉乡人民政府应该教育山民不要滥伐毛竹和乱掘冬笋，并且要做好刨山工作和在竹山上进行冬季施肥，以提高毛竹的产量、质量。
