Xinhua News Agency, January 17th: According to a France Presse report from Washington: Pakistani Prime Minister Muhammad Ali, in an interview with a reporter from the "U.S. News & World Report" in Karachi on the 11th, said that Pakistan would "broadly embrace U.S. military aid." Ali also told the American reporter: "We will establish bases to defend Pakistan. In an emergency, it is said that there will be no resistance to prevent us from inviting any friendly nations—including the United States—to use these bases to defend this region."

Prior to this, Prime Minister Ali had already publicly acknowledged at a press conference in Karachi on December 17th last year that Pakistan was "currently engaged in informal talks with the United States to discuss the issue of providing military equipment to Pakistan." Ali also said: "Naturally, we also need American military experts to train our officers and soldiers and enable them to use American-style weapons that the Pakistani army has not used until now." Before and after this, Pakistani Foreign Minister Zafrulla Khan had also twice revealed that negotiations for the United States to provide military "aid" to Pakistan had actually begun when Pakistani Army Commander-in-Chief Muhammad Ayub Khan "visited" Washington in the autumn of 1953.

The Pakistani government's public admission of accepting U.S. military aid and allowing foreign countries (the United States) to use Pakistani bases has caused serious concern among its Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern neighbors. The public in India, Burma, Afghanistan, Nepal, Ceylon, Indonesia, Iraq, Egypt, and other countries are closely watching the development of this issue. Government leaders, political parties, social organizations, and opinion leaders in many countries have repeatedly warned Pakistan to pay attention: that taking this path will create a threat to peace in Asia and pose a serious danger to the security of Pakistan's neighbors, as well as its own freedom and independence.

The public opinion of the countries concerned has been constantly offering goodwill advice to Pakistan, hoping that it will maintain friendly relations with its Asian neighbors. For example, Indonesia's "Abadi" newspaper, when discussing the reactions of various countries, specifically pointed out: "We would like to remind the Pakistani authorities to pay attention: if they ignore the reactions of their Asian neighbors, it would be very unwise."

However, according to a Reuters report from New York on the 6th, the diplomatic correspondent of "The New York Times" said that Pakistan had "abandoned" "neutrality" and had notified Washington of its willingness to act as a "defender of freedom," "thus qualifying for U.S. military aid." In response to a question from a reporter from "U.S. News & World Report," Ali also admitted that U.S. military "aid" to Pakistan "has created some tension in Indo-Pakistani relations." This situation shows that Pakistan's adventurous behavior is merely acting as a cat's paw for the United States, and therefore violates the peaceful aspirations of its Southeast Asian and Middle Eastern neighbors.

It is only natural that this policy of the Pakistani government has aroused the opposition of the broad masses of the Pakistani people. Ali told a reporter from "U.S. News & World Report": "If Pakistan does not receive U.S. military aid, the people may be disappointed." In fact, the protests from broad sections of Pakistani society against the conclusion of the US-Pakistan military treaty show that the Pakistani people have clearly realized the harm that this treaty will bring to them. In December 1953, a joint statement from the Jinnah Awami Muslim League, the Free Pakistan Party, the Sindh Trade Union Committee, the All-Pakistan Peace Committee, the Sindh Farmers' Committee, and the Pakistan Bank Employees' Federation clearly pointed out: "The US-Pakistan military treaty will mean allowing foreign rule over our internal life, meaning providing all our human and material resources to foreign countries that will bring war to our country."

According to the Indian News Service, after Ali publicly admitted that the United States could use Pakistani bases, "The Pakistan Times" immediately expressed its opposition on the 14th. The newspaper said: The sentiment that the Pakistani people fear that accepting U.S. military aid will cause tragic consequences is continuing to grow. The newspaper said that in Prime Minister Ali's recent remarks to an American magazine reporter, "the term 'emergency situation' has not been defined, but because the United States has been allowed to use our bases to defend this 'region' - not just Pakistan - therefore, the United States' definition of 'regional emergency' will be accepted, and whenever the United States wants to send troops to Pakistan's prepared bases, they can come. This will create a very dangerous situation, and it is extremely dangerous to ignore this situation." The newspaper said that this would "create the danger of turning Pakistan into a battlefield in conflicts that Pakistan does not want and have nothing to do with Pakistan's national interests, and may allow foreign forces to influence Pakistan's internal affairs." The newspaper appealed to Pakistani public leaders, asking them to take effective steps to prevent the Pakistani government from concluding a military agreement with the United States.

### 巴基斯坦总理承认将让美国使用军事基地  东南亚和中近东各国谴责美巴军事谈判

    巴基斯坦总理承认将让美国使用军事基地
    东南亚和中近东各国谴责美巴军事谈判
    【新华社十七日讯】据法新社华盛顿消息：巴基斯坦总理穆罕默德·阿里十一日在喀喇蚩接见
  “美国新闻与世界报道”周刊记者时说：巴基斯坦将“广泛拥护美国的军事援助”。阿里并对这个美国记者说：“我们将建立基地以保卫巴基斯坦，遇有紧急情况时，照说不会有什么阻力使我们不邀请任何友邦——包括美国在内——来使用这些基地以保卫这一地区。”
    在这以前，阿里总理在去年十二月十七日在喀喇蚩的记者招待会上就已经公开承认：巴基斯坦
  “现在已和美国进行非正式的会谈，讨论把军事装备供给巴基斯坦的问题。”阿里并说：“自然我们还需要美国的军事专家，来训练我们的官兵以及使得他们能够使用巴基斯坦军队到现在还没有使用过的美国式的武器。”在此前后，巴基斯坦外交部长查弗鲁拉汗也曾两度透露，美国给予巴基斯坦军事“援助”的谈判实际上在巴基斯坦陆军总司令穆罕默德·阿尤布汗于一九五三年秋天“访问”华盛顿时即已开始。
    巴基斯坦政府公开承认接受美国军事援助，并承认可让外国（美国）使用巴基斯坦的基地，引起了它的东南亚和中近东的邻邦的严重忧虑。印度、缅甸、阿富汗、尼泊尔、锡兰、印尼、伊拉克、埃及等国的公众，都密切注视着这个问题的发展，许多国家的政府领袖、各政党、社会团体和舆论界，多次忠告巴基斯坦，要它注意：它走这条道路将造成对亚洲和平的威胁，对巴基斯坦各邻国的安全以及它本身的自由与独立将造成严重危险。
    有关各国的舆论都对巴基斯坦不断提出善意的劝告，希望它与它的亚洲邻国友好相处。例如印尼的“永恒报”在谈到各国的反应时并曾特别指出：“我们要请巴基斯坦当局注意一下：如果他们忽视亚洲邻国的反应的话，那就太不聪明了。”
    但是，据路透社纽约六日讯，“纽约时报”外交记者说，巴基斯坦已“唾弃了”“中立”，并已通知华盛顿，愿意充当“自由的保卫者”，“因而有资格得到美国军事援助”。阿里在答复“美国新闻与世界报道”周刊记者问时也承认，美国对巴基斯坦的军事“援助”，“使印巴关系有一些紧张”。这种情形说明：巴基斯坦的冒险行为，只是为美国火中取栗，因而对它的东南亚和中近东的邻邦的和平愿望，是有所违背的。
    巴基斯坦政府的这个政策引起巴基斯坦广大人民的反对，是理所当然的。阿里对“美国新闻与世界报道”周刊记者说：“巴基斯坦如果得不到美国军事援助，也许人民就要失望。”其实巴基斯坦广泛阶层对缔结美巴军事条约的抗议说明：巴基斯坦人民已经清楚地认识到这个条约将会给他们带来怎样的危害。一九五三年十二月，真纳人民回教联盟、自由巴基斯坦党、信德省工会委员会、全巴基斯坦和平委员会、信德省农民委员会和巴基斯坦银行职员联合会的联合声明明白指出：“美巴军事条约将意味着允许外国统治我们的内部生活，意味着把我们的一切人力和物力供给将会给我们国家带来战争的外国。”
    据印度新闻处报道：在阿里公开承认可让美国使用巴基斯坦的基地之后，“巴基斯坦时报”立即在十四日表示反对。该报说：巴基斯坦人民害怕接受美国军事援助将造成悲惨的后果的情绪，正在继续增涨。该报说：在阿里总理最近对美国杂志记者的谈话中，“‘紧急情况’一词没有被按上定义，但是，由于美国得到许可能利用我们的基地保卫这个‘地区’——而不只是巴基斯坦——因此，美国对于‘区域性的紧急情况’所下的定义是会被接受的，并且无论什么时候美国想派军队到巴基斯坦准备好的基地来，他们就可以来。这样会造成非常危险的局面，而忽视这种局面是极端危险的。”该报说，这样将“造成使巴基斯坦变成不是巴基斯坦所愿意的、和巴基斯坦的国家利益毫无关系的冲突中的战场的危险，并且可能使外国势力得以影响巴基斯坦的内政。”该报向巴基斯坦的公众领袖们呼吁，要求他们采取有效步骤，阻止巴基斯坦政府和美国缔结军事协定。
