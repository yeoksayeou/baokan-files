The CCP Minquan Village Branch in Yushu County, Jilin Province, conscientiously organized cadres to study the General Line and inspected the mutual aid and cooperation work in the village. In recent years, under the leadership and assistance of the county and district Party committees, the Minquan Village Branch has actively led farmers to organize and develop production, with 71% of the village's households participating in agricultural production cooperatives. In addition to the original supply and marketing cooperative, the village recently established a credit cooperative. After several production increase campaigns, the agricultural production cooperatives produced more grain and increased the income and improved the lives of its members than the mutual aid teams and individual farmers. The development and consolidation of the cooperatives have prevented class divisions in the countryside. However, with the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement, new problems have constantly emerged, and the branch's leadership has fallen somewhat behind, with past leadership methods becoming less applicable. Problems encountered in the work of the agricultural production cooperatives (hereinafter referred to as "cooperatives") were not resolved in a timely manner, which affected the consolidation and development of the cooperatives. After studying the General Line, the enthusiasm of Party members and cadres was generally enhanced, and they felt that "this time there is a future." The branch further organized cadres to inspect the work of the cooperatives. Everyone's minds became clearer, and they realized the problems in their past work and found the direction to move forward.

First, everyone had a clearer understanding of the struggle between the mutual aid and cooperation movement and rural capitalist forces. The inspection work revealed that rich peasant elements were trying to drag farmers onto the capitalist dead end through various means. They seized on certain shortcomings of individual cooperatives to spread rumors and slander, undermining the prestige of the cooperatives; they sowed discord among members; they used petty favors to lure farmers, making them dependent on them and depriving them of economic independence, so that they could exploit them. In cooperatives with weaker leadership, there were even phenomena of rich peasant elements usurping leadership. The rich peasant element Zheng Deyi became the cashier and propagandist of the Gaoyi Cooperative, with his younger brother as the supervisor and his son as the technical committee member. In the cooperative, he was "powerful and influential," manipulating the work of the cooperative, attempting to make the cooperative degenerate. Although the branch knew about these situations in the past, it did not realize the seriousness of the problem. After studying the General Line, everyone became more vigilant and realized that this was a deliberate attempt by rich peasant elements to usurp the leadership of the cooperative. Some cadres used to feel that "left" was not right, and neither was right, so they were depressed and dared not move forward. After studying, everyone's socialist consciousness and revolutionary enthusiasm were enhanced, and the branch's awareness in implementing policies was strengthened. At the same time, it was recognized that every work of a Communist Party member in the countryside has a significant meaning for the realization of the socialist transformation of agriculture, and that it is wrong for Party members and League members to be uneasy about rural work or to passively wait for socialism.

Through study, everyone understood that the basic key to consolidating and improving cooperatives lies in improving management, increasing production, and increasing the income of members. In the study, using the comparison method of good and bad cooperatives, everyone realized that good cooperatives cannot be broken up, and bad cooperatives cannot be tied up with ropes. The "sweeping the periphery" approach of "in order to consolidate the cooperative, we must first rectify the mutual aid team; in order to consolidate the mutual aid team, we must first rectify individual households" is incorrect. In the past, many people believed that the basic reason why the cooperatives were not doing well was that a few individuals were mischievous and blamed the members for being backward, failing to see that the key was the lack of Party leadership in the cooperatives. Because of the lack of or no Party leadership in the cooperatives, various problems encountered in the work were not easily resolved in a timely manner. For example, some cooperative directors have undemocratic leadership styles, management committees are not functioning, production is unplanned, labor organization is poor, there is a lot of wasted work, labor discipline is lax, and financial management is chaotic. After studying, everyone clarified that in order to consolidate and improve the cooperatives, it is necessary to strengthen the political leadership of the branch in the cooperatives. After the Party members and League members in the Shuguang Agricultural Production Cooperative clarified their understanding, they carried out criticism and self-criticism, reviewed the past problems of "three Party members with three minds" and the lack of unity among Party members, and improved their work.

Through study, everyone understood why cooperatives are only allowed to do well and not allowed to do badly. In the past, everyone's understanding of the important significance of the work of the cooperatives was insufficient, especially the actual impact of the success or failure of the cooperatives. Farmers joined the cooperatives as private owners. When they first joined the cooperatives, some farmers were still hesitant, even with one foot inside and one foot outside (keeping good land and near land outside the cooperative). After joining the cooperatives, some farmers were still wavering. This requires Communist Party members to truly run the existing cooperatives well, not only to produce more grain and increase the income of members, but also to support national industrialization. Let the farmers see clearly from the facts that participating in the cooperatives is embarking on a bright road to prosperity for all. If the existing cooperatives are not run well and the farmers cannot see the benefits of participating in the cooperatives, they cannot attract farmers to voluntarily take the socialist road, and they will objectively indulge the spontaneous capitalist tendencies among the farmers. After understanding these principles, some cooperative directors reviewed their erroneous ideas such as "doing well or doing badly, we'll talk about it after the harvest," "the members can disperse if they say so, and they can work if they say so," and "I won't be a director no matter what, I'll go out and earn some money." Branch secretaries and branch committee members all reviewed the mistakes of not caring about the work of the cooperatives in the past, and resolved to participate in the leadership of the cooperatives and actively lead the distribution and rectification work of the cooperatives.

After this study and inspection work, everyone deeply realized that the old leadership style can no longer keep up with the needs of work development, and that a new style must be established and new leadership methods must be learned. The following points have been initially clarified:

1.  It is necessary to strengthen the Party's ideological construction and improve the political and ideological leadership level of the branch. The branch should regard improving the socialist consciousness of Party members and opposing capitalist ideas within the Party as an important task in the transition period. In the future, in addition to planned centralized training, a regular branch education system should be established and adhered to for the education of Party members. Because the future rural work will become increasingly complex, it is not enough to just learn something from meetings at the higher level from time to time. It is necessary to study the Party's various policies on rural areas regularly and conscientiously, further clarify the class boundaries and ideological boundaries, and overcome capitalist ideas within the Party.

2.  Adapt to the characteristics of the cooperatives and establish new leadership and work systems. First of all, the branch should regard leading the cooperatives as the main task. Branch secretaries and branch committee members should participate in the leadership work of the cooperatives. The branch realized from the inspection of production leadership that no matter which link of agricultural production is not done well, it will affect the harvest. Only by participating in the daily leadership work of the cooperatives and strengthening the Party's leadership in the entire production process can the Party's policies be truly implemented and increased production be guaranteed. Secondly, it is necessary to give full play to the organizational role of the Party and the League. Party and League groups should be divided according to the cooperatives, so as to ensure the completion of the cooperative's production plan through the organization. Branch committee members should grasp the key to cultivate the working method from point to surface, establish a division of labor and collective leadership system; be good at giving play to the role of the management committee, unite activists and non-Party masses to work together, and strengthen the close ties between the Party and the masses. The branch work plan must take into account the work plan of the cooperative.

3.  Adhere to the policy of combining political work and economic work. The Party branch's education of farmers on the two roads cannot stop at general appeals, but must guide the enthusiasm of the masses to do a good job in production, and carry out political education on the basis of mobilizing and organizing the masses to do a good job in production. The branch should grasp the key issues in production when carrying out political work, and carry out ideological education to the masses around the key issues to ensure increased production and more grain. The economic tendencies in mobilizing the masses to complete economic tasks by cooperatives and other economic departments must be corrected. For example, in order to complete the task of grain purchase, the supply and marketing cooperative once publicized the high price of grain purchase on the blackboard newspaper. As a result, the farmers were unwilling to sell grain, which caused many difficulties for the grain purchase work, let alone carrying out the education of the worker-peasant alliance through grain purchase. Some agricultural production cooperatives only use earning work days to mobilize members to work, lacking political content. Therefore, the leading cadres of the cooperatives must learn to master the policy of combining political work and economic work.

After studying, everyone also realized the problems that should be paid attention to in strengthening political work. The branch should first strengthen the education of the leading cadres of the cooperatives. From the inspection work, it was found that there are still speculators and bad elements among the deputy cooperative directors. Some cooperative directors have serious commandist styles of separating from the masses. The branch realized from here that the branch must first ensure the purity and soundness of the leading core of the cooperative ideologically, organizationally, and politically. On the one hand, the branch must always be vigilant and never allow rich peasant elements and bad elements to usurp the leadership of the cooperative; on the other hand, it should establish a regular education system. The branch should regard the leading cadres of the cooperative as its own important cadres to manage and educate them, and improve their understanding of the mutual aid and cooperation movement through the study of the General Line, and criticize their various erroneous understandings. Secondly, the branch should pay attention to cultivating the socialist ideological consciousness of the members. Within the agricultural production cooperative, there are still contradictions between socialist factors and the spontaneous forces of small-scale peasant economy, and the changes in the ideological consciousness of farmers often lag behind the changes in economic conditions. Therefore, it is necessary to carry out collectivist education to the farmers in view of the problems that occur in collective labor, oppose the farmers' scattered, uncoordinated, come and go as they please habits, and strengthen labor discipline; educate farmers to cherish public property and oppose destructive theft; constantly carry out agricultural technical education, oppose conservative ideas, and constantly conduct various policy education for members, such as equal pay for equal work for men and women, and grain purchase policies. Third, the publicity work within the cooperative should be established and strengthened. One of the cooperative directors (Party member or League member) should lead the political work within the cooperative. The propaganda team within the cooperative must carry out appropriate division of labor or contracting according to the production team and group, so as to closely combine with production and carry out mobilization work in the production process. Blackboards and glory boards should be set up in the cooperative to commend outstanding people and deeds in a timely manner; reading groups should be organized, radio broadcasts should be listened to, cultural and recreational activities should be carried out, and political work meetings of the cooperative should be held regularly to inspect work and sum up experience.

In order to strengthen the guarantee role of the Party and League organizations, Party and League building work should be carried out in the cooperatives with few Party and League members in a planned way, and attention should be paid to selecting and educating activists.

　　中共民权村支部结合总路线的学习检查对农业生产合作社的领导
    刘　权
    中共吉林榆树县民权村支部，认真地组织干部学习了总路线，检查了该村的互助合作工作。几年来，民权村支部在县、区党委领导与帮助下，积极领导农民组织起来，发展生产，全村百分之七十一的农户参加了农业生产合作社。除原有供销合作社外，该村最近又成立了信用合作社。经过几次增产运动，农业生产合作社比互助组和单干农民都多打了粮食，增加了社员的收入，改善了社员的生活。合作社的发展和巩固阻止了农村的阶级分化。但是随着互助合作运动的发展，新问题不断出现，支部的领导有些跟不上了，过去的领导方法有些已不适用了，农业生产合作社（以下简称合作社）工作中遇到的问题得不到及时解决，就影响了合作社的巩固与发展。学习总路线后，党员、干部的积极性普遍提高了，认为“这回有奔头了”。支部进一步组织干部检查了合作社的工作，大家的头脑清醒了，眼睛明亮了，发现了过去工作中的问题，找到了前进的方向。
    首先，大家对互助合作运动与农村资本主义势力之间的斗争，有了比较明确的认识。从检查工作中发现，富农分子企图用各种办法把农民拖到资本主义的死路。他们抓住个别合作社的某些缺点造谣诬蔑、打击合作社的威信；挑拨社员之间的关系；用小恩小惠引诱农民，使农民依附他们，在经济上丧失独立自主能力，以便他们进行剥削。在领导较弱的合作社内甚至发生了富农分子篡夺领导权的现象。富农分子郑德玉当上了高义合作社的出纳员又是宣传员，弟弟是监委，儿子是技术委员，在合作社内“腰粗力气大”，操纵合作社工作，企图使合作社变质。支部过去虽然知道这些情况，但并没有认识到这个问题的严重性。学习了总路线，大家提高了警惕，认识到这是富农分子有意篡夺合作社的领导权。原来有些干部觉得“左”也不对，右也不对，因而思想苦闷不敢前进。经过学习，提高了大家的社会主义觉悟和革命积极性，加强了支部在执行政策中的自觉性。同时认识到共产党员在农村的每一工作都对实现农业的社会主义改造有重大意义，党员、团员不安心农村工作或者消极等待社会主义的思想都是不对的。
    通过学习，大家明白了合作社巩固提高的基本关键，在于改善经营管理，提高产量，增加社员的收入。在学习中，用好坏社对比的方法，使大家认识到好社棒打不散，坏社绳子绑也绑不住。那种“为了巩固社，就得先整互助组；为了巩固互助组，就得先整单干户”的扫外围办法是不对的。过去，很多人认为社搞不好的基本原因是个别人调皮捣蛋，埋怨社员落后，看不到关键在于社内缺乏党的领导。由于社内缺乏或没有党的领导，工作中发生的各种问题都不容易及时得到解决。如有些社主任领导作风不民主，管理委员会不起作用，生产无计划，劳动组织不好，大量窝工，劳动纪律松懈，财务管理混乱等等。经过学习，大家明确了要巩固和提高合作社，必须加强支部在社内的政治领导。曙光农业生产合作社中的党员、团员明确认识以后，开展了批评与自我批评，检讨了过去“三个党员三条心”党员不团结等问题，改进了工作。
    通过学习，大家懂得了为什么合作社只许搞好，不许搞坏。过去大家对合作社工作的重要意义认识不足，尤其是对合作社搞好搞坏所发生的实际影响认识不足。农民是以私有者身分加入合作社的。开始入社时，有些农民还是半信半疑，甚至一脚门里一脚门外（社外留好地、近地）。入社后有些农民仍然动摇不定。这就需要共产党员们把现有的合作社真正办好，既能多打粮食，增加社员收入，又能支援国家工业化。让农民从事实中看清楚参加合作社是走上了大家一同富裕的光明大道。如果现有的合作社搞不好，不能使农民看到参加合作社的好处，就不能吸引农民自愿地走社会主义的道路，就在客观上放纵了农民中自发的资本主义趋势。懂得了这些道理以后，有的社主任就检查了自己“搞好搞坏，打完场再说”、“社员说散就散、说干就干”、“说啥也不当主任，出外赚点钱”等错误想法。支部书记、支部委员们都检讨了过去不关心社的工作的错误，决心分工参加社的领导，并且积极领导了社的分配工作和整顿工作。
    经过这次学习和检查工作，大家深深地体会到老一套的领导作风已经跟不上工作发展的需要，必须树立新的作风、学习新的领导方法。并初步明确了以下几点：
    一、必须加强党的思想建设，提高支部政治思想领导水平。支部应该把提高党员的社会主义觉悟，反对党内的资本主义思想，当做自己在过渡时期的重要任务。今后，对党员的教育，除了有计划的集中训练外，还应当建立与坚持经常的支部教育制度。因为，今后的农村工作日益复杂，光靠不定期地从上边开会学点东西已经不够了，必须经常认真地学习党关于农村的各项政策，进一步划清阶级界限和思想界限，克服党内资本主义思想。
    二、适应合作社特点，建立新的领导制度和工作制度。首先，支部应把领导合作社当作主要任务。支部书记、支部委员应参加合作社的领导工作。支部从检查生产领导中认识到农业生产中，不管那一环节搞不好都会影响收成，只有参加社的日常领导工作，在整个生产过程中加强党的领导才能真正贯彻党的政策，保证增加产量。其次，必须充分发挥党、团的组织作用，党、团小组应该以社为单位来划分，以便通过组织保证完成社的生产计划。支部委员应掌握重点培养从点到面的工作方法，建立分工负责集体领导制度；要善于发挥管理委员会的作用，团结积极分子、非党群众一道工作，加强党与群众的密切联系。支部工作计划必须考虑到社的工作计划。
    三、坚持政治工作与经济工作相结合的方针。党支部对农民进行两条道路的教育，不能停留在一般号召上，必须把群众的热情引导到搞好生产上面，在发动和组织群众搞好生产的基础上进行政治教育。支部在进行政治工作时，要抓住生产中的关键问题，围绕关键问题对群众进行思想教育，保证提高生产多打粮食。合作社及其他经济部门，在发动群众完成经济任务中的经济主义偏向必须纠正。比如供销合作社为了完成购粮任务，曾经在黑板报上宣传高价收买粮食，结果，农民反而不愿卖粮，给购粮工作造成许多困难，更谈不到通过购粮对农民进行工农联盟教育。有些农业生产合作社，只用赚劳动日来动员社员干活，缺少政治内容。因此必须使合作社的领导骨干学会掌握政治工作与经济工作相结合的方针。
    经过学习，大家还认识到加强政治工作中应该注意的问题。支部首先应该加强对合作社的领导骨干的教育。从检查工作中发现正副合作社主任中还有投机分子、坏分子。有些社主任有严重的脱离群众的命令主义作风。支部从这里认识到：支部必须首先从思想上、组织上、政治上保证合作社领导核心的纯洁与健全。一方面，支部必须时时警惕，决不允许富农分子、坏分子篡夺合作社的领导权；另一方面应建立经常的教育制度。支部应把合作社的领导干部，看成是自己的重要干部来加以管理和教育，通过总路线的学习来提高他们对互助合作运动的认识，批判他们的各种错误认识。其次，支部要注意培养社员的社会主义思想意识。在农业生产合作社内部，依然存在着社会主义因素与小农经济自发势力的矛盾，并且农民思想意识的变化往往落后于经济条件的变化，因此必须针对集体劳动中发生的问题对农民进行集体主义教育，反对农民的散漫不齐心、愿来就来愿走就走的习惯，加强劳动纪律；教育农民爱护公共财产，反对破坏偷盗行为；不断进行农业技术教育，反对保守思想，并不断对社员进行各种政策教育，如男女同工同酬，购粮政策等。第三，应该建立与加强社内的宣传工作。社主任中应有一个主任（党员或团员）领导社内政治工作。社内宣传员小组必须按生产队、组来进行适当分工或包干，以便密切结合生产，进行生产过程中的鼓动工作。社内设黑板报、光荣牌，及时表扬优秀人物、事迹；组织读报组，收听广播，开展文娱活动，并且定期召开合作社政治工作会议，检查工作，总结经验。
    为了加强党、团组织的保证作用，应有计划地在党、团员少的合作社中进行建党和建团工作，并经常注意挑选和教育积极分子。
