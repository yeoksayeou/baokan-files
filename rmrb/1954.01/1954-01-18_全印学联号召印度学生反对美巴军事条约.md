    全印学联号召印度学生反对美巴军事条约
    【新华社新德里十七日电】全印学生联合会决定一月二十二日为反对美巴军事条约抗议日。
    全印学联在十四日发表的声明中说：拟订中的美巴军事条约已对亚洲的和平与自由构成了严重的威胁，它不仅威胁着巴基斯坦的主权，同时也威胁着印度的主权。声明说：“在印度进行的反对运动将鼓舞巴基斯坦学生和民主力量加强反对这一威胁，并使我们更紧密地团结在一起以反对战争和奴役的势力。”
    全印学联号召印度的所有的学生团体在这个有关整个印度的问题上团结起来，为争取和平与自由而斗争。
    据新华社讯：据“印度快报”报道，查谟和克什米尔人民一致斥责策划中的美巴军事条约。人们认为这个条约不但是对印度和亚洲各国的安全的威胁，而且是对全世界的和平的威胁。人民都举行集会和游行示威来抗议这个条约。
    “印度旁观者周刊”指出：“许多人认为，策划中的美巴军事条约，是美国干涉亚洲人民事务的又一个厚颜无耻的企图。”
    印度尼西亚首都雅加达的“独立报”十三日说：“印尼认为，美国（对巴基斯坦）的军事援助对太平洋沿岸的亚洲国家——包括印尼在内——的安全是一种威胁。”
