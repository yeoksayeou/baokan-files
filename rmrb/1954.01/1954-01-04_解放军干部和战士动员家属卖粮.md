Xinhua News Agency, January 3rd—Cadres and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army actively support the state's grain policy and are mobilizing their families to sell surplus grain to the state to support national economic construction.

Cadres and soldiers of various units are generally writing letters to their families, relatives, and friends in rural areas to promote the rationale for supporting national industrial construction and to encourage them to sell surplus grain to the state. Soldiers from a company of a certain unit of the Beijing Public Security Force wrote more than 120 letters to their families and relatives. Zhu Dachang, a soldier from a company of a certain unit, wrote to his cousin in the afternoon after listening to the political instructor explain the grain policy in the morning, asking him to sell the surplus grain to the state and deposit the money in the cooperative or bank. Fearing that his cousin would be deceived by unscrupulous merchants, he also wrote to his fiancée, uncle, and the township people's government, asking them to encourage and urge his cousin to sell the grain to the state.

Many cadres and soldiers took the opportunity of family members visiting the troops to conduct face-to-face propaganda and education, explaining the benefits of selling surplus grain to the state. Xu Liansheng, a communication soldier from the first battalion of a certain regiment of the East China Military Region, was visited by his father, who told him that the family had a good harvest and could save 1,300 jin of rice paddy. Xu Liansheng immediately explained to his father the reasons for selling surplus grain to the state, and then gave his father a practical account: selling surplus grain to the state, the money can be deposited in the bank with interest, and next year a portion of the money can be withdrawn to buy fertilizer, which can strive for a greater harvest. This is beneficial to both the country and oneself. His father was convinced and promised to sell the surplus grain to the state when he returned home. Some soldiers who returned home to visit also actively promoted the state's grain policy to their families and took the lead in selling their family's surplus grain to the state. Ning Qingfu, a soldier from the seventh company of a certain unit of the Beijing Public Security Force, returned home and happened to coincide with the village farmers brewing to sell surplus grain to the state. He took the lead in selling his family's surplus grain to the state and deposited the balance in the cooperative, and then mobilized his eldest brother, second brother, and neighbors to sell the surplus grain to the state. At the village mobilization meeting, Ning Qingfu was the first to take the stage and announce his family's grain sales plan. The villagers all expressed their intention to learn from Ning Qingfu's family and sell the surplus grain to the state.

Some troops organized working groups to cooperate with the local people's government to publicize the state's grain policy and mobilize the family members of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and demobilized soldiers to sell surplus grain to the state. The military sub-districts under the Jiangsu Military Region successively transferred 228 cadres in early December to form 43 working groups. The military sub-districts of the Jiangsu Military Region also convened representative meetings of family members of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, and demobilized soldiers to mobilize them to sell surplus grain to the state.

At present, cadres and soldiers of various units are continuing to publicize to their families in various ways, and encouraging their families to work hard to increase production and practice economy, and strive to sell more surplus grain to the state to support the country's construction.

    解放军干部和战士动员家属卖粮
    【新华社三日讯】中国人民解放军各部队干部和战士积极拥护国家的粮食政策，纷纷动员家属把余粮卖给国家，以支援国家经济建设。
    各部队的干部、战士普遍采取写信的方式，向在农村中的家庭、亲戚和朋友宣传支援国家工业建设的道理，动员他们把余粮卖给国家。驻京公安部队某部一个连的战士就向家属和亲戚写了一百二十多封信。某部一连战士朱大常上午听了政治指导员讲解粮食政策后，下午就写信给堂兄，要他把余粮卖给国家，把钱存入合作社或银行。他还怕堂兄受了奸商欺骗，又给他的未婚妻、伯父和乡人民政府写了信，要他们鼓励督促堂兄把粮食卖给国家。
    许多干部战士趁家属来部队看望的机会，当面向他们进行宣传教育，讲解把余粮卖给国家的好处。华东军区某团一营通讯员徐连生的父亲来看望他，告诉他家里收成很好，可以节余碾一千三百斤大米的稻谷。徐连生立刻向父亲讲解把余粮卖给国家的道理，然后从实际出发给父亲算了一笔账：把余粮卖给国家，钱存到银行还有利息，到明年取出一部分钱去买肥料，就可以争取更大的丰收。这样既有利于国家又有利于自己。他父亲被他说得心悦诚服，答应回家后一定把余粮卖给国家。有的战士回家看望，也积极向家属宣传国家的粮食政策，并带头把家里的余粮卖给国家。驻京公安部队某部七连战士宁庆福回家时，正赶上村中农民酝酿把余粮卖给国家。他首先带头把家里的余粮卖给国家，把余款存入合作社，然后又动员他的大哥、二哥和邻居将余粮卖给国家。全村开动员大会时，宁庆福又第一个登台宣布他家的卖粮计划。全村农民都表示要向宁庆福家学习，把余粮卖给国家。
    有的部队组织了工作组配合当地人民政府宣传国家的粮食政策，动员烈属、军属和复员军人把余粮卖给国家。江苏军区所属各军分区在十二月初就先后抽调了二百二十八名干部，组成了四十三个工作组。江苏军区各军分区还召开了烈属、军属和复员军人代表大会，动员他们把余粮卖给国家。
    目前，各部队干部和战士正继续以各种方式向家属进行宣传，并鼓励家属努力增产节约，争取把更多的余粮卖给国家，支援国家的建设。
