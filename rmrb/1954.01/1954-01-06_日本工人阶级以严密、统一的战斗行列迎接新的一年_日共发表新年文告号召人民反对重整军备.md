Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 5th: As the new year begins, the Japanese working class is further consolidating its unified fighting ranks, preparing to meet the even more frenzied attacks by the Yoshida government, aimed at workers, to implement rearmament.

The past year was one in which the American and Japanese reactionaries launched a rampant offensive against all Japanese workers in order to force the Japanese people to accept rearmament. The Yoshida government formulated the fascist anti-strike law, destroying the rights of coal and electrical industry workers to strike. Not only that, whenever the strike movement intensified, the Yoshida government carried out blatant interference and suppression. At the same time, Japanese monopoly capitalists, in many industrial sectors such as coal mines, steel, and chemicals, used methods such as layoffs, wage cuts, and increased labor intensity to implement economic militarization, creating large numbers of unemployed and further pushing Japanese workers into the abyss of poverty.

However, the Japanese working class waged a heroic and tenacious struggle against the attacks of the American and Japanese reactionaries, and in the struggle, they have become even stronger. Throughout the past year, the struggles of Japanese workers to defend their vital rights, defend peace, and fight for national independence have risen one after another, continuously and without interruption.

In these struggles, Japanese workers have developed their united action, waged persistent struggles, and the departments participating in the struggles are very widespread. In the struggle against the anti-strike law, millions of workers across Japan, regardless of the different trade union organizations to which they belonged, used strikes, demonstrations, and protest rallies to carry out three large-scale general struggles, striking at the Yoshida government's plot to deprive workers of their basic rights. More than 100,000 workers belonging to the All-Japan Garrison Forces Labor Union and the All-Japan Garrison Forces Labor Union, as well as workers employed by other U.S. occupation forces, unanimously held an unprecedented 48-hour general strike on August 12, causing panic among the American and Japanese reactionaries who were turning Japan into a U.S. military base. In the year-end struggle, in which a total of one million public officials participated, workers in many state-owned enterprise departments such as railways, postal services, and telecommunications won year-end allowances through large-scale joint actions, striking at the Yoshida government's policy of suppressing wages to carry out rearmament. Japanese workers also demonstrated their tenacious fighting spirit in the long-term struggle. Coal miners at the Mitsui Mining Company persisted in a 112-day strike and production reduction struggle to oppose layoffs, finally achieving victory. The struggle of workers at the Kawasaki factory of Showa Denko Company to demand living allowances, which began at the beginning of 1953, also lasted for more than 100 days. Other strikes by workers at Tokyo Machinery Works and Nissan Chemical Industries Company to demand wage increases and oppose layoffs continued for 50 or 60 days. Workers participating in various struggles, in addition to Yoshida government's public officials and workers at U.S. military bases, included industrial sectors such as steel, shipbuilding, machinery, electrical machinery, chemicals, coal mines, transportation, textiles, and paper making.

The characteristics of the 1953 struggles of Japanese workers are that the solidarity of the Japanese working class has become more consolidated, the struggles have become more widespread, and, more importantly, the political nature of the struggles has become increasingly clear. In all movements for peace, democracy, and national independence, the Japanese working class often stands at the forefront of the struggle. The Hokuriku Private Railway Labor Union refused to transport military supplies for the U.S. military to the Uchinada Village firing range, and the general strike of garrison workers and the strike of workers at the Akabane factory of the Japan Steel Works, managed by the U.S. military, all had the obvious nature of demanding national independence and defending peace. In many cases, the struggle to demand wage increases and oppose layoffs has further developed to be directly linked to the struggle to support peace and oppose rearmament. For example, steel workers in Kansai, in the struggle to demand the issuance of temporary allowances, simultaneously put forward the slogans of breaking free from U.S. "embargo" restrictions and establishing a peaceful economy. The withdrawal of the National Railway Labor Union and the General Federation of Japanese Private Railway Labor Unions from the "International Confederation of Free Trade Unions," which is engaged in selling out the interests of the international working class, also shows that the Japanese working class has achieved further victories in crushing the conspiracies of domestic and foreign reactionaries to undermine the unity of the Japanese working class.

In its New Year's message for 1954 to the Japanese working class and the people of the whole country, the Central Guidance Department of the Japanese Communist Party pointed out: The progress of rearmament and the establishment of military bases are threatening the freedom and living standards of the people. The time has come to form a united front against rearmament. The JCP also called on the Japanese working class and the people of the whole country to fight together to defend peace, democracy, and living standards. The Japanese working class, in reviewing the progress of the struggles in the past year, is facing the more intense struggles ahead with full confidence. People all over the world welcome Malenkov's speech.

### 日本工人阶级以严密、统一的战斗行列迎接新的一年  日共发表新年文告号召人民反对重整军备

    日本工人阶级以严密、统一的战斗行列迎接新的一年
    日共发表新年文告号召人民反对重整军备
    【新华社五日讯】东京消息：日本工人阶级在进入新的一年的时候，正在进一步紧密自己的统一的战斗行列，准备迎击吉田政府为实行重整军备而对工人进行的更加疯狂的进攻。
    过去一年是美日反动派为了强制日本人民接受重整军备而对日本全体工人进行猖狂进攻的一年。吉田政府制订了法西斯的禁止罢工法，摧残了煤矿和电气产业工人的罢工权利。不仅如此，每当罢工运动激烈化的时候，吉田政府还进行露骨的干涉和镇压。同时，日本垄断资本家在煤矿、钢铁、化学等许多产业部门中都用解雇、降低工资、加强劳动强度等办法实行经济军事化，制造了大批失业，进一步把日本工人推入贫困的深渊。
    但是，日本工人阶级对美日反动派的进攻进行了英勇顽强的斗争，并且在斗争中锻炼得更加坚强了。在过去整个一年中，日本工人为了保卫切身权利、保卫和平与争取民族独立而进行的斗争此起彼伏，始终连续不断。
    在这些斗争中，日本工人发展了他们的统一行动，进行了持久的斗争，而且参加斗争的部门非常普遍。在反对禁止罢工法的斗争中，日本全国各地的数百万工人不分所属的工会组织的不同，用罢工、示威游行和抗议集会等形式进行了三次大规模的总奋起斗争，打击了吉田政府剥夺工人基本权利的阴谋。属于日本全国驻军工会和全日本驻军工会的工人和其他美国占领军雇用的工人共十多万人，在八月十二日一致举行了空前的四十八小时总罢工，使得把日本变为美国军事基地的美日反动派惊慌失措。在共有上百万公职人员参加的年终斗争中，铁路、邮电等许多国营企业部门的工人，以声势浩大的联合行动争得了年终津贴，打击了吉田政府压低工资进行重整军备的政策。日本工人还在长期的斗争中表现了他们顽强的战斗性。三井矿山公司的煤矿工人为反对解雇坚持了一百一十二天的罢工和减产斗争，终于取得胜利。昭和电工公司川崎工厂工人为要求生活津贴而从一九五三年年初开始的斗争，也坚持了一百多天。其他像东京机械制作所和日产化学工业公司工人要求提高工资和反对解雇的罢工都连续进行了五、六十天之久。参加各种斗争的工人，除了吉田政府的公职人员和美国军事基地的工人以外，包括了钢铁、造船、机器、电机、化学、煤矿、交通运输、纺织和造纸等产业部门。
   一九五三年日本工人的斗争的特点，是日本工人阶级的团结更加巩固、斗争更加普遍，而且更有重要意义的是斗争的政治性质已越来越鲜明了。在一切争取和平、民主与民族独立的运动中，日本工人阶级经常站在斗争的最前列。北陆私营铁道工会拒绝为美军运输军用物资到内滩村打靶场去，驻军工人的总罢工和美军管理下的日本制钢所赤羽工厂工人的罢工，都具有明显的要求民族独立与保卫和平的性质。在许多情形下，要求提高工资和反对解雇的斗争都已进一步发展到和拥护和平、反对重整军备的斗争直接联系起来。例如关西的钢铁工人在要求发给临时津贴的斗争中，同时提出了摆脱美国“禁运”限制和建立和平经济的口号。国营铁道工会和日本私营铁道工会总联合会的退出以出卖国际工人阶级利益为职业的“国际自由工会联合会”，也表明日本工人阶级在粉碎国内外反动派破坏日本工人阶级统一的阴谋方面取得了进一步的胜利。
    日本共产党中央指导部在一九五四年新年时向日本工人阶级和全国人民发表号召指出：重整军备的进行和军事基地的建立正在威胁着人民的自由和生活水平。形成反对重整军备的统一战线的时机已经到来。日共并号召日本工人阶级和全国人民一道为保卫和平、民主与生活水平而斗争。日本工人阶级在回顾过去一年间斗争的进展时，正满怀信心地面对今后更加激烈的斗争。全世界人民欢迎马林科夫的谈话
