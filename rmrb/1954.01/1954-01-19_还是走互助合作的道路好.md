It's Better to Take the Road of Mutual Aid and Cooperation
By Our Correspondent Liu Qun

The people of Yushu Village all know that the family of Li Deqing, the Party branch secretary, is doing quite well. Before the land reform, Li Deqing worked for landlords, so poor that he couldn't even afford pants. After the land reform, the situation was very different. He had a house, land, cattle, horses, and a cart. His son even found a pretty good "catch." Speaking of these things, Li Deqing smiled happily.

However, Li Deqing also had another thought: "I can't read a single character, and I'm already forty-seven years old. I'm almost fifty. Will I live to see socialism?" Thinking of these things, he was unwilling to manage the village's work too much. He established a principle called "neither ahead nor behind." When encountering difficult matters, he would calmly say, "Go find Village Chief Yang to handle it."

The village chief, named Yang Qingshan, was an impetuous person. Whenever he heard Li Deqing say this, he would reply, "What's the point of having the two of us wooden dummies in the village!"

Li Deqing happened to be a person who never rushed, no matter what you said, he still did things the same old way. The mutual aid and cooperation organization in Yushu Village fell apart under his "leadership" of "neither ahead nor behind" and "never rushing."

It was the spring of 1953. The ice of the Tao'er River melted, and the wild geese came. According to the habits of farmers in the Baicheng County area, it was time to prepare for sowing. At this time, Li Deqing returned from a meeting in the county, thinking all the way about the county committee's call to organize and establish mutual aid teams. He thought about it and felt it was difficult to handle. Because there had been lessons learned in the past, when the district was strict, there were mutual aid teams; as soon as the district cadres left, the mutual aid teams collapsed. This time, although the county committee repeatedly emphasized "voluntary," Li Deqing thought: Seven people in a group have seven different minds, how can you organize them? If you don't organize, this is the Party's call. After thinking it over, he decided to do it the old way: "If they say organize, then organize."

In this way, Li Deqing organized a mutual aid team including sixteen households. Zhao Yongcai became the team leader.

Li Deqing had a younger brother named Li Dequan, who also participated in this mutual aid team. From the beginning, he grumbled to Li Deqing: "We have carts and horses, why do we need anyone else?"

Li Dequan especially loved his rabbit-gray horse. He regarded the horse as a piece of his own flesh, wishing he could hold the horse's mouth to feed it. He felt sorry when the mutual aid team used his horse. When people gave him work points, he would say, "No matter what, it's not as good as me using it myself." Therefore, the team often had trouble with this horse. Zhao Yongcai suggested, "Let's have a meeting to solve it." Li Deqing said, "What's the point of having a meeting? Just deal with it." But in his heart, he sympathized with his younger brother: How worry-free it would be to use one's own plow...

In June, the seedlings grew lush and green, and the sorghum seedlings were more than half a foot tall. This was the time to hoe the first time. Suddenly, it started to rain continuously, and no one could go to work in the fields. Everyone watched as the weeds grew together. The more it rained, the more impatient people became.

Li Deqing was even more anxious. He thought: Once the weather clears, everyone will have to take turns hoeing, and each family will only get a turn every ten days or so. His own land might be overgrown with weeds. If his two brothers, plus his wife and children, all went to the fields together, wouldn't that be great? But could a Party branch secretary work individually?

When the weather cleared, Li Deqing went to the field and saw that the weeds were indeed all over the ridges. This time, he couldn't stand it. The next day, at daybreak, Li Deqing led his daughter, son, and sister-in-law to hoe the fields. Before leaving, he said to Li Dequan, "You be the representative in the team." That evening, just as Li Deqing led his family into the house, the mutual aid team leader Zhao Yongcai and the Party branch organization committee member Lü Jingchun came to the door.

"You, the branch secretary, how can you only take care of yourself?" Lü Jingchun criticized impolitely.

"You have to manage the team's land too," Zhao Yongcai also requested.

But Li Deqing thought: What's the point of all this? I have land and horses, and people to weed... But when he thought that he was a Communist Party member and the village branch secretary, he had to say, "I'll go back to the mutual aid team tomorrow."

Although he said this, Li Deqing didn't do it. He led his family to his own field again. Thus, the news that "the branch secretary is also working individually" spread throughout the village like a gust of wind. All the mutual aid teams in the village followed suit and disbanded, and seventeen Party members also imitated the branch secretary and worked individually.

This made Village Chief Yang Qingshan very anxious. In the hot weather of June, Yang Qingshan, sweating profusely, ran to Li Deqing's house and then to Li Deqing's field, finally finding Li Deqing with great difficulty.

"Ha! Ha! You're doing well!" Yang Qingshan said angrily when he saw Li Deqing, "You, the branch secretary, don't you care about the affairs of the masses?"

"Muddled temple, muddled gods," Li Deqing pondered for a long time, and replied to Yang Qingshan coldly and faintly.

"What are you saying?" Yang Qingshan said loudly, "Is that what a branch secretary says? Take a look at what the village is like!"

In the village, some middle peasants who were doing well were not very enthusiastic about mutual aid and cooperation in the first place. When Li Deqing's mutual aid team disbanded, they became even more lost. Thus, some sold cattle and others sold horses. The middle peasant Ji Wanlin, who originally had eight cattle, sold four of them in one go. He was afraid that when they cooperated again, his cattle would be "organized" away.

Li Deqing paid even less attention to the village's affairs, and the masses discussed him a lot. His wife also blamed him: "Look at you, your work is not consistent, you are always slow and dragging, and you shrink back when you encounter difficulties. But you should also think about it! I didn't even wear a cotton-padded coat for many years before, if it weren't for the Communist Party, where would you have such a good life!" After hearing his wife's words, Li Deqing recalled the past when three generations of his family worked for landlords. He also recalled the scene when he fought the landlords together with the masses and when he was elected as the branch secretary. He felt that he was not like a Party member. "Only caring about myself and not caring about the masses, what kind of Party member is that!" he asked himself painfully.

After the autumn harvest, Li Deqing received a notice from the district, asking the village branch secretaries, village chiefs, and Party organization committee members to go to the county for a meeting. "It's probably to summarize the experience of the mutual aid and cooperation movement," Li Deqing guessed uneasily.

When Li Deqing arrived in the county, it turned out that he was there to study the Party's general line for the transition period. A member of the county committee made a report, talking about how to gradually implement national industrialization and how to carry out the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce. What he found particularly interesting was that the road of mutual aid and cooperation in the countryside was also the road to common prosperity. After hearing these things, Li Deqing felt as if two doors had been opened in his heart, and he knew that the kind of hopeless thinking he had before was wrong. When everyone was asleep that night, Li Deqing tossed and turned, unable to sleep. He thought: I was really confused in the past! I didn't listen to the Party's words, and I didn't lead the masses onto the right path. He especially remembered Lingxia Village, which the county committee member had repeatedly praised. In that village, more than 90% of the farmers were organized, and four agricultural production cooperatives were established. Each cooperative member received twenty dan of grain net... And my family, with so much labor, worked hard for a year and only harvested thirty-two dan of grain. If you deduct the public grain and seeds, it would be less than half. Every family in Lingxia Village is living a good life, but there are still more than thirty poor families in our Yushu Village. What made him even sadder was that he had become separated from the masses, and people were complaining that he had not led them onto the right path. The more he thought about it, the more he couldn't sleep. He felt that the people in the village would point their fingers at him and scold him, and the Party would not forgive him...

On the way back to the village, Li Deqing was thinking about how to talk to the masses. In the past, whenever there were difficulties in work, he would say that the masses were not easy to lead. Now, it seemed that he was completely confused and had lost his way. How could he lead everyone onto the right path? How could he lead everyone onto the new road? Just as Li Deqing was feeling distressed, Village Chief Yang Qingshan spoke up:

"Our village is lagging behind. Compared to Lingxia Village, we are two years behind. They have already established agricultural production cooperatives! We don't even have a permanent mutual aid team. What do you say we should do?..."

What could Li Deqing say? This was all the result of his individual work. He had abandoned the Party's general line and had not played a role in leading the masses.

As soon as Li Deqing returned to the village, he immediately gathered together the sixteen households that had been in a mutual aid team in the spring to discuss the matter of reorganizing mutual aid and cooperation. He said: "In the spring, I didn't lead well and caused the mutual aid team to collapse. It's all my fault, I had individualistic thoughts. This time, I studied the general line in the county and I understood that individual work means wanting to take the old capitalist road and will never reach a socialist society."

As soon as he said this, everyone spoke up. "You didn't understand the general line in the past, and you took the lead in individual work. You cheated us!" Wang Chunhua's criticism was still full of anger.

"If you had insisted on the mutual aid team, wouldn't we have been in the agricultural production cooperative a long time ago?" another person complained.

Li Deqing began to feel a lot of pressure. After a while, he felt that if he didn't do this, he would be walking down that dead end—the capitalist road. What would he do then! He felt that everyone was saving him. So he said excitedly: "I thank everyone for helping me and reversing my bad thoughts."

"I didn't lead the team well," Zhao Yongcai also made a self-criticism, "It's also my fault, I relied on the branch secretary and didn't dare to move forward."

After Li Deqing and Zhao Yongcai made self-criticisms, almost all the members of the original mutual aid team spoke up. Some examined themselves, and some criticized others. Li Deqing opened his eyes wide and looked carefully at the team members, he heard people whispering. Originally, everyone had their own ideas, but now, everyone was of one mind again. Everyone regretted not taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation earlier.

Li Deqing was even happier than everyone else, he said: "Now we are going to organize cooperative mutual aid, will you still follow?"

"Wherever you go, we go," everyone said in unison.

Li Deqing also remembered the old saying that had been churning in his mind these days: "It's better to take the road of mutual aid and cooperation!"

Now, Li Deqing has persuaded his younger brother. He also took the lead in selling surplus grain to the state and plans to buy two more cattle. Under his influence and promotion, Yushu Village added more than one hundred cattle at once. People have once again embarked on the road of mutual aid and cooperation.

    还是走互助合作的道路好
    本报记者　刘群
    榆树村的人们都知道：党支部书记李德清家的日子过得很不错。土地改革前，李德清给地主扛活，穷得连裤子都穿不上。土地改革后，境况大不同了，他有了房子、土地、牛、马、大车。儿子还找到了个挺不错的“对象”。说起这些来，李德清就乐呵呵地笑了。
    但是，李德清也有另外一个想法：“我一个大字不识，今年已经四十七岁了，眼看快奔五十岁的人啦，那辈子能赶上社会主义呢？”想到这些，他对村里的工作就不愿意多管了。他确定了一条原则，叫做“不前不后”。遇着不好办的事情，他就不慌不忙地说：“找杨村长去办吧。”
    村长叫杨青山，是个性情急躁的人。他每逢听到李德清这句话，就回答说：“村里摆咱们俩个木头疙疸干啥！”
    李德清又恰巧是个从来不着急的人，任凭你说什么话，他还是照他那老样儿去做。榆树村的互助合作组织，就在他这种“不前不后”，又“不慌不忙”的“领导”下散伙了。
    那是一九五三年的春天，洮儿河的冰融化了，大雁也来了，按照白城县这一带农民的习惯，该准备播种了。这时候李德清从县里开会回来，他一路上想着县委会的号召：组织起来、成立互助组的事情。他左思右想觉得不好办。因为早年有过教训，区上抓得紧了就有互助组；区干部一走，互助组就垮了。这回，县委虽然再三强调要“自愿”，可是，李德清想：小组里七个人有七条心，怎么组织哩？不组织吧，这又是党的号召。想来想去，还是照老法儿办：“叫组织，就组织起来吧。”
    就这样，李德清组织了一个包括十六户人家的互助组。赵永财当了组长。
    李德清有个弟弟叫李德权，也参加在这个互助组里。一开头他就和李德清叽咕：“咱们有车有马还用着谁呢？”
    李德权特别喜爱他那一匹兔灰色的马，他把大马看成自己身上的一块肉，恨不得把着马嘴去喂马。他一见互助组里使他的马就心疼。人家给工钱，他还说：“怎样也不如我个人使好。”因此，组里就常为这匹马打麻烦。赵永财提议：“开会解决解决吧。”李德清嘴里说：“开会干啥？对付着干就是了。”心里可同情他的弟弟呢：自己套一付犁，有多么省心……。
    六月，小苗长得茁壮油绿，高粱苗长有半尺多高了，这正是该铲头遍地的时候。忽然下开了连绵大雨，谁也不能下地干活，眼看草苗一齐长。雨越下，人越沉不住气了。
    李德清心里更着急。他想：天一晴过来，大伙要轮流铲地，每家十几天才能轮上一次，自己的地就可能荒芜了，如果自己哥弟俩，加上老婆、孩子一齐下地，不就挺好吗？可是，支部书记能单干吗？
    天晴了，李德清来到地里一看，果然草苗满垄。这一下，他可挺不住了。第二天，天一亮，李德清便领着他的姑娘、小子、弟媳妇去铲地了。临走他还对李德权说：“你一个人在组里顶数吧。”这天傍晚，李德清领着一家老小刚进屋，互助组长赵永财、党支部组织委员律景春就找上门来了。
    “你这个支部书记，怎么光顾自己？”律景春不客气地批评着。
      “组里的地你也得管管嘛。”赵永财也要求着。
    可是，李德清心想：扯这个蛋干啥？我?地有马，锄草有人……。但他一想到自己是共产党员，村支部书记，只好说：“明天我回互助组去。”
    话虽这样说，李德清却没有这样办，他又领着
  一家大小到自己的地里去了。于是，“支部书记也单干起来了”的消息，像一阵风似的立刻传遍了全村。村里所有的互助组紧跟着散伙了，十七名党员也仿照着支部书记单干起来了。
    这一来，可把村长杨青山急坏了。六月大热天。杨青山冒着满头汗水，跑到李德清的家里，又跑到李德清的地里，好容易才找到了李德清。
      “哈！哈！你可倒好！”杨青山一见李德清，就气虎虎地说：“你这个支部书记，还管群众的事不管？”
      “糊涂庙，糊涂神吧。”李德清寻思了半天，竟这样冷冷淡淡地回答了杨青山。
    “你说什么？”杨青山大声地说：“这是你支部书记说的话吗？你看看村里是个啥样儿！”
    村里，有些日子过得好的中农，本来对于互助合作就不大热心，李德清的互助组一散伙，他们就更迷失了方向。于是，卖牛的卖牛，卖马的卖马。中农纪万林原有八头牛，一回就卖了四头。他害怕再互助的时候，把他的牛“组织”走了。
    村里的事情，李德清更不大管了，群众对他议论纷纷。老婆也责备他：“看你，工作没有经常性，干什么都是疲疲沓沓，有困难就往后缩。可是，你也想想看呀！早先我跟你多少年都没穿过一条棉裤，要不是共产党，你那里来的好日子！”李德清听了老婆的话，回想起了老少三辈给地主扛活的往事。也想起跟群众一起斗地主以及他被选为支部书记的情景，他觉着自己不像个党员。“光顾自己，不管群众，这叫什么党员呀！”他痛苦地自问着。
    秋收后，李德清接到区里的通知，叫各村支部书记、村长、党组织委员到县里开会去。“八成是总结互助合作运动的经验，”李德清不安地猜测着。
    李德清到了县里，原来是让他学习党在过渡时期总路线。县委委员作了报告，说到怎样逐步实行国家工业化，怎样实行对资本主义工商业的社会主义改造。使他特别感到兴趣的是：农村走互助合作的道路，也就是大家富裕的道路。李德清听了这些，心里真像打开两扇门那样亮堂，他知道原来那种没奔头的想法错了。当夜里人都睡着了的时候，李德清却翻来覆去睡不着，他想：过去我真糊涂！没有听党的话，没有领导群众走到正道上来。他特别记起了县委委员一再夸奖的岭下村。那个村，百分之九十多的农户都组织起来了，还成立了四个农业生产合作社；一个社员净分二十石粮……，而我家那么多劳动力，辛辛苦苦闹腾了一年，才打了三十二石粮，要是去掉公粮、籽种，就少了一半。岭下村家家都过好日子，我们榆树村可还有三十多户贫农。更使他伤心的，是脱离了群众，人们都埋怨他没有把人领上正道。他越想越睡不着。他觉着村里的人们会指着他的鼻子骂他，党也不会原谅他……。
    在回村的路上，李德清心里就打转转：想着怎样同群众说。过去，工作一有困难，就说群众不好领导。现在来看，完全是自己糊里糊涂，自己迷失了方向，怎么能领导大家走正道？怎么能领导大家走新道路呢？李德清正想得难过的时候，村长杨青山讲话了：
    “咱们村落后啦。照岭下村比，就晚走了二年。人家都成立生产合作社啦！咱们连个常年互助组都没有，你说怎么办呢？……”
    李德清说啥呢？这都是他单干的结果呀，他丢弃了党的总路线，没有起了领导群众作用。
    李德清回到村里，立刻把春天在一个互助组里的十六户，集合在一起，商量重新组织互助合作的事情。他说：“春天，我没领导好，叫互助组垮台了。这都怪我，我有单干思想。这次在县里学习了总路线，我明白了单干就是想走资本主义的旧道路，永远走不到社会主义的社会去。”
    他一说，大伙都说话了。“你过去不明白总路线，你带头单干，你可把我们坑啦！”在王春华的批评里，还带着气虎虎的劲儿。
    “你要坚持互助组的话，我们不早就到农业生产合作社了吗？”又一个人抱怨地说。
    李德清开始感到有很大的压力。过了一会，他却觉得要不这样，走上那条死路——资本主义的道路，那可怎么办！他觉得大伙儿都在挽救他。于是他激动地说：“我感谢大家对我的帮助，扭转我这个坏思想。”
    “小组没领导好，”赵永财也做自我批评了，“这也怪我，我光靠支部书记，啥事不敢向前走。”
    在李德清、赵永财做了自我检讨后，原来互助组的组员，差不多都说话了。有的检查了自己，有的批评了别人。李德清睁大眼睛，细看那些组员们，他听见人们嘁嘁喳喳地说着。原来是一个人一条心，现在，大家又是一条心了。大家都后悔没有早走互助合作的路。
    李德清比大家更高兴，他说：“现在咱来组织合作互助，你们还跟着走吗？”
    “你到那，我们到那，”大家异口同声地说。
    李德清又想起这几天来常常翻腾起来的一句老话：“还是走互助合作的道路好！”
    现在，李德清已经说服了他的弟弟。他还带头把余粮卖给国家，计划再买两头牛。在他的影响、推动下，榆树村一下添了一百多头牛。人们又走上了互助合作的道路。
