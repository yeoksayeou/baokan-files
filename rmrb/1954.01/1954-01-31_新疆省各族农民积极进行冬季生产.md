Farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang Province Actively Engage in Winter Production

Under the leadership of local Party and government departments, farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang are actively engaged in winter production.

Since November of last year, farmers of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang have been actively engaged in work such as manure accumulation, canal repair, winter irrigation, plowing and leveling land, and adding and repairing farm tools. According to incomplete statistics, the area of ​​winter plowing totaled more than 1.4 million mu, and the area of ​​winter irrigation was more than 4.3 million mu. In addition to winter wheat fields and autumn-plowed land, some pasture grasslands were also winter-irrigated. In terms of manure accumulation, statistics from only eighteen counties, including Yuepuhu and Ningxi, show 1.45 billion jin. Many farmers use their winter leisure time to engage in sideline production, and some use their sideline income to purchase draft animals or repair and purchase farm tools. Two townships in Jimusar County have newly added 21 carts, repaired 43 large and small carts, purchased 91 draft animals, and more than 1,700 other farm tools.

This year, Party and government organs at all levels in Xinjiang Province have attached particular importance to technical instruction in leading winter production. Since November, 24 counties in five special districts, including Aksu and Kashgar, have held mutual aid and cooperation training classes. Eight places in special districts such as Dihua, Yanqi, and Aksu have held short-term mobile mass technology training classes centered on technology guidance stations or agricultural experiment farms. More than 3,000 students participated. After learning agricultural science and technology, they actively led the masses to carry out winter production. At the same time, through summarizing experience in increasing production and inspired by typical demonstrations, the broad masses of farmers have broken with conservative ideas, recognized the importance of improving farming techniques, and have therefore been able to actively respond to the call and do a good job in winter production. Some farmers in the colder northern Xinjiang region are also actively engaged in winter plowing and winter irrigation. For example, the Ili area has winter-plowed 50,000 mu and winter-irrigated 100,000 mu. The area of winter plowing in the southern Xinjiang region has generally increased compared with the past. The area of autumn-plowed and winter-plowed land in the Naomao Lake area of ​​Iwu County has expanded by one-third compared with 1952.

　　新疆省各族农民积极进行冬季生产
    新疆各族农民在各地党政部门的领导下，都积极地进行冬季生产工作。
    新疆各族农民从去年十一月开始，便积极进行积肥、修渠、冬灌、翻地平土以及增添和修补农具等工作。据不完全统计，冬翻地面积共一百四十多万亩，冬灌面积四百三十多万亩，除冬麦地和秋耕地外，并对部分牧场草地进行了冬灌。积肥方面，仅岳普湖、宁西等十八县的统计，就有十四亿五千万斤。很多农民都利用冬闲进行副业生产，有些人把副业收入用来添置耕畜或修、购农具。吉木萨尔县的两个乡就新添大车二十一辆，修理大小车四十三辆，买进耕畜九十一头，其他农具一千七百多件。
    新疆各级党政机关今年在领导冬季生产时特别重视技术传授工作。自十一月以来，阿克苏、喀什等五个专区有二十四个县举办了互助合作训练班，迪化、焉耆、阿克苏等专区有八处以技术指导站或农事试验场为核心举办了短期巡回的群众技术传授班，参加的学员达三千多人，他们学习了农业科学技术以后，回去积极带动群众进行冬季生产。同时，广大农民通过总结增产经验和在典型示范的启发下，打破了保守思想，认识到改进耕作技术的重要，因而都能积极响应号召，搞好冬季生产。气候较冷的北疆地区有的农民也积极进行冬犁冬灌，如伊犁区就冬耕了五万亩，冬灌了十万亩。南疆地区的冬耕面积普遍比过去增加，伊吾县淖毛湖区的秋耕冬翻地面积比一九五二年扩大了三分之一。
