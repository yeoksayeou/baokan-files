    The Great Power of Leninism
    ——"Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!"
    Editorial of the Fourth Issue, 1954

    It has been thirty years since the fiery heart of Vladimir Ilyich Lenin, the great revolutionary fighter, the outstanding teacher, leader, and friend of the working people of the whole world, stopped beating.

    Lenin's name and the entire history of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, the establishment of the first state of working people - the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics - and the development of the world communist movement are inextricably linked. Lenin's name has become the banner of the entire progressive humanity in the struggle for peace, democracy, and socialism, and for a happy future for the people. The working people of all countries deeply commemorate Lenin.

    Lenin's great and heroic life is a shining example of serving the revolutionary cause of the people. Lenin was a great successor to the cause and theory of Marx and Engels, an outstanding strategist of the proletarian revolution, and a fearless mountain eagle in battle. On the new historical stage, in the era of imperialism and proletarian revolution, Lenin enriched all aspects of Marxism, continued to develop this great theory, and defended it against the conspiracies of international opportunists who attempted to distort it and eliminate its revolutionary spirit.

    Lenin was a great communist theorist. Leninism is an international theory that synthesizes the experience of the world revolutionary movement, and therefore it is suitable and necessary for proletarian parties in all countries. Leninism's immortal ideas have had a great influence on the fate of the people and the entire course of world history.

    Lenin's theory of socialist revolution pointed out to the working people the correct path to liberation from capitalist enslavement, enabling them to see the clear prospect of the struggle to change the world through revolution. Lenin developed Marx's theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat and discovered that the Soviet system was the best political form of this dictatorship. At the same time, he clarified that although the forms taken by the state may differ in the period of transition from capitalism to communism, its essence is the same—the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    In the history of Marxism, Lenin was the first to fully expound the theory of the party, saying that the party is the vanguard of the proletariat and the main weapon in the hands of the proletariat, without which it is impossible to realize the dictatorship of the proletariat and build socialism and communism. Lenin's greatest contribution to the Russian and international workers' movement was that he not only expounded the necessity of establishing a new type of Marxist party, but also actually established this party, a creative Marxist revolutionary party, and formulated its ideological, organizational, tactical, and theoretical principles.

    In the struggle against divisionists and nationalists in the workers' movement, Lenin adhered to the internationalist principles of establishing a Marxist party. The Communist Party established by Lenin and those who shared his ideas stood from the very beginning as the banner of proletarian internationalism and the idea of friendship among all nationalities, uniting the revolutionary workers of all nationalities in Russia under its banner. In formulating the theoretical program and policy of the Marxist party on the national question, Lenin explained that this question is an inseparable part of the entire revolutionary struggle of the working class for the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    After Lenin's death, with the passage of time, the world-historical significance of his doctrine of a new type of party—that is, a party capable of leading the masses in the struggle to eliminate capitalism and build a new socialist society—became increasingly greater. The experience of the Chinese Communist Party and the Communist and Workers' Parties of the people's democratic countries convincingly proves the great truth of Marxism-Leninism: only a new type of party, a revolutionary Marxist party, is capable of leading the proletariat and all working people in the struggle to overthrow the system of exploitation.

    Armed with Lenin's doctrine and his theory of socialist revolution, the Communist Party, after forming an alliance of the working class and the working peasants, carried out the Great October Socialist Revolution in Russia, overthrew the rule of capitalists and landlords, established the dictatorship of the proletariat, and led the masses of the people onto the path of socialism. The Party bravely and resolutely guided and organized the new life, carrying out a persistent struggle to consolidate the new social and state system.

    After Lenin's death, the enemies of socialism fantasized that the Communist Party and the Soviet state would be weakened as a result. But their wishful thinking went bankrupt. The working class and all working people of the Soviet state united even more closely around their own Communist Party. Under the leadership of the Central Committee headed by Joseph V. Stalin, a brilliant student of Lenin and the great successor to his immortal cause, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union marched forward holding high the victorious banner of Leninism. All the activities of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union—the leading, guiding, and inspiring force of Soviet society—are permeated with the immortal ideas of Leninism. In the relentless struggle against the open and hidden enemies of Marxism-Leninism, the Communist Party cleared away Trotskyites, Bukharinites, bourgeois nationalists, and other traitors and capitulationists from its path. In this struggle, the Communist Party realized Lenin's theory of socialist industrialization of the country and the socialist transformation of agriculture, and led the people to achieve the victory of socialism.

    Today, the working people of the Soviet Union consistently follow Lenin's path and are successfully building the magnificent edifice of communist society in the Soviet Union. Communism—the dream of the kindest people—will gradually become a reality in the Soviet Union. How prophetic Lenin's words sound today, when he said: "Our grandchildren will gaze in amazement at the documents and relics of the era of the capitalist system. They will find it difficult to imagine how the sale of essential necessities could be in the hands of private individuals, how factories could belong to individuals, how one person could exploit other people, and how people could live without working at all." Indeed, for the young generation of the Soviet Union who are growing up in socialism and have not suffered the hardships of capitalism, it is difficult for them to imagine how in a society there could be tens of millions of people suffering from cruel exploitation, falling into unemployment and starvation, while a small handful of monopoly capitalists live in extreme extravagance, extracting huge profits from the suffering of the people. They find it difficult to imagine a society where national oppression and racial discrimination are prevalent, and a system that propagates hateful ideas of mankind in need of bloody war.

    The Communist Party and the Soviet state have always been most concerned about people. During the civil war and the recovery period, Lenin showed paternal concern for improving the material living conditions of industrial workers, working peasants, and intellectuals, as well as for developing Soviet science and culture. Following Lenin's instructions, the Communist Party and the Soviet government are currently taking large-scale measures to ensure that the ever-growing material and cultural needs of the entire Soviet society are met to the greatest extent, and to ensure the further development of agriculture, the rapid increase in the production of consumer goods, and the development of Soviet trade.

    The rich experience of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in building a socialist society is an inspiring example for the struggle of the Communist and Workers' Parties of all countries for social revolutionary change. For all Communist and Workers' Parties, Leninism is an inexhaustible treasure trove of theoretical thought and revolutionary experience. They obtain from Leninism clear goals, confidence in victory, and a deep understanding of the objective laws of historical development and the domestic and international situation. Leninism arms them with correct strategies and tactics.

    Leninism has won the entire hearts of millions of people. The camp of peace, democracy and socialism is a vivid symbol of the powerful force of Marxist-Leninist doctrine and the great achievements of the people; this camp has fundamentally changed the balance of power on the international stage. The people of Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, Bulgaria, and Albania, under the leadership of their Communist and Workers' Parties—parties loyal to Marxism-Leninism—and with the fraternal assistance of the Soviet Union, have broken free from the shackles of fascist occupation and have forever ended the hated anti-people rule of capitalists and landlords.

    The Chinese people, under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party, achieved a great victory over domestic reactionaries and imperialist ruling forces, founded the People's Republic of China, and became a powerful force in the camp of peace and democracy. Lenin's prediction about the awakening of the Asian people has been confirmed with astonishing accuracy. The Chinese revolution has opened a new page in the history of the national liberation struggle of the people in colonial and dependent countries.

    Leninism lives forever and is invincible! Its influence is constantly expanding in various countries. The communist movement—the movement to which Lenin devoted his life—has spread to various countries and continents. The doctrine of Marxism-Leninism is invincible because it is the truth, because it expresses the vital interests and most heartfelt desires of the broadest masses of working people.

    Leninism most profoundly reveals the irreconcilable contradictions of imperialism and exposes the true face of the imperialist bourgeoisie. In pursuit of profits, imperialists want to plunge people into the abyss of another war. Imperialist ideologues have been diligently promoting the vicious ideas of national inequality and racial inequality, cosmopolitanism and hatred of mankind—ideas incompatible with the interests of the majority of mankind, and trying to create national disputes. The reactionary governments of capitalist countries are pursuing anti-people policies of expanding armaments, forming aggressive blocs, militarizing the national economy, and attacking the democratic rights of the people.

    Leninism is a powerful ideological weapon in the hands of the working people to fight against the warmongers, to strive for peace and international friendship, and to strive for their national sovereignty and independence. The relationship between the countries of the camp of peace, democracy, and socialism—a relationship of friendship and cooperation based on equality and respect for mutual interests—is a vivid example of the victorious principle of proletarian internationalism of Marxism-Leninism.

    Leninism is inextricably linked with the struggle for peace. The entire history of the Soviet state is a history of struggle for peace and international friendship. In the years since the founding of the Soviet state, the struggle for peace has been the guiding principle of the foreign policy of the Communist Party and the government of the Soviet Union. Lenin always emphasized the possibility of peaceful coexistence between two systems and the possibility of peaceful competition, emphasizing that the peaceful policy of the Soviet people is supported by the overwhelming majority of people in the world. Today, the Soviet people stand at the forefront of the great army of peace advocates in the world. The Soviet government has always been, is, and will continue to do its utmost to ensure that the people of all countries can live in peace, to ensure that international tensions are eased, and to ensure that normal relations between countries can be established. Communist and Workers' Parties in capitalist countries, colonies and dependent countries widely publicize among the masses the true situation of the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy, the great achievements of the Soviet Union in building communism, the People's Republic of China, and the economic and cultural development in the people's democratic countries. The ideas of Leninism call on the people of all countries to struggle for peace and friendly cooperation among nations. The glorious and invincible banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, uniting millions of people, flies high all over the world; it is the banner of the struggle for the liberation of mankind from the shackles of capitalism, for peace, democracy, and socialism.

    列宁主义思想的伟大力量
    ——“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
    一九五四年第四期社论
    伟大的革命战士、全世界劳动人民的杰出的导师、领袖和朋友——乌拉季米尔·伊里奇·列宁的炽热的心脏停止跳动，至今已有三十年了。
    列宁的名字和苏联共产党的全部历史，和第一个劳动人民的国家——苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟——的建立，和世界共产主义运动的发展都是不可分离地联系着的。列宁的名字已成为全体进步人类为争取和平、民主和社会主义，为争取人民的幸福前途而斗争的旗帜。各国劳动人民深深地纪念着列宁。
    列宁的伟大、英勇的一生是服务于人民革命事业的光辉的榜样。列宁是马克思和恩格斯的事业和理论的伟大的继承者，他是无产阶级革命的杰出的战略家，他是在战斗中无所畏惧的山鹰。在新的历史舞台上，在帝国主义和无产阶级革命时代，列宁丰富了马克思主义的各方面，继续发扬这个伟大的理论，并维护这个理论，反对国际机会主义者试图歪曲它并取消它的革命精神的阴谋。
    列宁是共产主义伟大的理论家。列宁主义是国际性的理论，它综合了世界革命运动的经验，因此对于各国无产阶级政党都是适合和必要的。列宁主义的不朽的思想对于人民的命运，对于世界历史的整个进程都起了极大的影响。
    列宁关于社会主义革命的理论为劳动人民指出了从资本主义奴役下解放出来的正确的道路，使他们看到以革命来改变世界的斗争的明确远景。列宁发展了关于无产阶级专政的马克思理论，并发现苏维埃制度是这种专政的最好的政治形式。同时，他阐明了，虽然在从资本主义过渡到共产主义的时期中，国家所采取的形式可以不同，其本质却是一样的——无产阶级专政。
    在马克思主义的历史上，列宁是第一个全面阐明关于党的理论的人，他说党是无产阶级的先锋队，是无产阶级手里的主要武器，没有这个武器，就不可能实现无产阶级专政，建设社会主义和共产主义。列宁对于俄国和国际工人运动的最伟大的贡献是，他不仅阐明了建立新式马克思主义政党的必要，并且实际建立了这个党，创造性的马克思主义的革命政党，他为这个党制订了思想上、组织上、策略上和理论上的原则。
    列宁在与工人运动中的分裂主义者和民族主义者进行斗争中，坚守建立马克思主义政党的国际主义原则。列宁及那些思想和他相同的人所建立的共产党从一开始就挺身作为无产阶级国际主义和各族人民友好思想的旗手，把俄国一切民族的革命工人团结在它的队伍中。在制订马克思主义政党关于民族问题的理论纲领和政策时，列宁说明这个问题是工人阶级争取无产阶级专政的整个革命斗争中的一个不可分割的部分。
    列宁逝世以后，随着时间的过去，他的关于新型政党——即有能力领导群众为消灭资本主义和建设新的社会主义社会而进行斗争的政党——的学说的世界历史意义越来越大。中国共产党和各人民民主国家的共产党及工人党的经验令人信服地证明了马克思列宁主义的伟大真理：只有新型政党、革命的马克思主义政党才有能力领导无产阶级和全体劳动人民进行推翻剥削制度的斗争。
    以列宁的学说、以列宁的社会主义革命理论武装起来的共产党在结成了工人阶级和劳动农民的联盟后，在俄国进行了伟大的十月社会主义革命，推翻了资本家和地主的统治，建立了无产阶级专政，领导人民大众走上了社会主义的道路。党勇敢地和坚决地指导和组织新生活，为巩固新的社会和国家制度进行坚持不渝的斗争。
    列宁逝世后，社会主义的敌人妄想共产党和苏维埃国家会因此削弱。但是他们的如意算盘破产了。苏维埃国家的工人阶级和全体劳动人民却更加紧密地团结在他们自己的共产党的周围。苏联共产党在以列宁的天才学生和他的不朽事业的伟大继承者约·维·斯大林为首的中央委员会的领导下，高举胜利的列宁主义的旗帜向前迈进。苏联共产党——苏联社会的领导、指导和鼓舞力量——的全部活动都贯穿着列宁主义的不朽思想。苏联共产党在和马克思列宁主义的公开和隐藏的敌人进行无情斗争中，在它的道路上扫清了托洛茨基分子、布哈林分子、资产阶级民族主义者以及其他的叛徒和投降者。共产党在这斗争中实现了列宁关于国家的社会主义工业化以及农业的社会主义改造的理论，领导人民取得了社会主义的胜利。
    今天，苏联的劳动人民始终不变地遵循着列宁的道路，在苏联顺利地建设着宏伟的共产主义社会的大厦。共产主义——最善良的人们的美梦——在苏联将逐渐成为事实。列宁的话在今天听来是多么富有预言性，他说：“我们的子孙将惊奇地凝视着资本主义制度时代的文件和遗物。他们将很难想像主要必需品的出售怎么能掌握在私人手里，工厂如何能属于个人，一个人如何能剥削其他的人以及人们如何能完全不劳动而生存”。确实，对于在社会主义中成长的没有遭受过资本主义苦难的苏联年轻的一代来说，他们很难想像在一个社会里怎么可能有千千万万人遭受残酷的剥削，陷于失业和饿死，而一小撮垄断资本家却穷奢极欲，从人民的苦难中榨取巨额利润。他们很难想像流行着民族压迫和种族歧视的社会以及宣传需要血腥战争的憎恨人类的思想的制度。
    共产党和苏维埃国家一向是最关心人的。在内战和恢复时期，列宁对于改善产业工人、劳动农民和知识分子的物质生活情况以及发展苏联科学和文化，表现了父亲般的关心。共产党和苏联政府遵照列宁的指示，目前正在采取大规模的措施以保证整个苏联社会的不断增长的物质和文化需要得到最大满足，并保证进一步发展农业、迅速增加消费品的产量以及发展苏维埃贸易。
    苏联共产党在建设社会主义社会中的丰富的经验对于各国共产党和工人党进行社会革命性变革的斗争是鼓舞的榜样。对于一切共产党和工人党来说，列宁主义是理论思想和革命经验的无穷的宝库。它们从列宁主义中取得明确的目标、胜利的信心以及对于历史发展客观法则和国内和国际形势的深刻了解。列宁主义以正确的战略和策略武装了它们。
    列宁主义思想已经赢得千百万人民的整个心灵。和平、民主与社会主义阵营是马克思列宁主义学说的强大力量及人民的伟大成就的生动的象征；这个阵营已经根本改变了国际舞台上的力量对比。波兰、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利、罗马尼亚、保加利亚与阿尔巴尼亚人民在他们的共产党与工人党——忠于马克思列宁主义的政党——的领导下，在苏联的兄弟般的援助下，摆脱了法西斯占领的桎梏，永远结束了众所痛恨的资本家与地主的反人民统治。
    中国人民在光荣的中国共产党的领导下取得了对国内反动派与帝国主义统治力量的伟大胜利，创立了中华人民共和国，成了和平民主阵营的一个强大的力量。列宁关于亚洲人民觉醒的预见惊人准确地证实了。中国的革命在殖民地与附属国家人民的民族解放斗争史上展开了崭新的一页。
    列宁主义永远活着，并无往而不胜！它的影响正在各国不断扩大。共产主义运动——列宁毕生所致力的运动已经扩大到各个国家与大陆。马克思列宁主义学说是不可战胜的，因为它是真理，因为它表达了最广大的劳动人民的切身利益与最衷心的愿望。
    列宁主义最深刻地揭露了帝国主义的不可调和的矛盾，并揭发了帝国主义资产阶级的真面目。帝国主义者为了追求利润，想把人民投进另一次战争的深渊里去。帝国主义的思想家一直竭力地宣扬民族不平等与种族不平等、世界主义与憎恨人类等恶毒思想——与人类中大多数人的利益不相容的思想，并尽力想制造民族纠纷。资本主义国家的反动政府奉行着扩充军备、组成侵略集团、把国民经济军事化以及进攻人民民主权利的反人民政策。
    列宁主义是劳动人民掌握来进行反对战争贩子、争取和平与国际友好、争取他们的民族主权与独立的斗争的强有力的思想武器。和平、民主与社会主义阵营各国之间的关系——以平等与尊重相互利益为基础的友好与合作关系，就是马克思列宁主义的无产阶级国际主义原则得到胜利的一个生动例子。
    列宁主义是与争取和平的斗争不可分地联结在一起的。苏维埃国家的整个历史就是争取和平与国际友好的斗争史。自苏维埃国家成立以来的这些年中，为和平而斗争一直是苏联共产党与政府的外交政策的指导原则。列宁一向强调两种制度有可能和平共处，有可能进行和平竞赛，着重指出苏联人民的和平政策是得到全世界人民中压倒多数的拥护的。今天，苏联人民站在全世界和平拥护者大军的最前列。苏联政府一向、正在并将继续尽最大力量来确使各国人民得过和平生活，确使国际紧张局势得到缓和，确使各国之间的正常关系得以建立。资本主义国家、殖民地与附属国中的共产党与工人党广泛地在群众中宣传关于苏联的和平外交政策、关于苏联在建设共产主义方面的巨大成就、关于中华人民共和国以及各人民民主国家内经济与文化发展的真实情况。列宁主义的思想召唤各国人民为和平及各国友好合作而斗争。团结着千百万人民的马克思、恩格斯、列宁与斯大林的战无不胜的光荣旗帜，高高地在世界各地飘扬；这是争取人类从资本主义的桎梏下解放，争取和平、民主与社会主义的斗争的旗帜。（新华社据罗马尼亚通讯社布加勒斯特二十二日电）
