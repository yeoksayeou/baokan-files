Xinhua News Agency, Anshan, January 25th: Anshan Iron and Steel Company exceeded its 1953 production increase and savings plan by 29.4%. Last year, various production indicators achieved by Anshan Iron and Steel were significantly higher than in 1952. For example, the total value of production last year increased by 40.48% compared to the previous year, labor productivity increased by 28.45%, and costs decreased by 12.34%. The steel supplied by Anshan Iron and Steel to more than 1,000 customers across the country last year also increased by more than 40% compared to 1952.
    In the process of completing last year's annual production plan and production increase and savings plan, all employees of Anshan Iron and Steel demonstrated labor creativity and diligently learned from the Soviet Union. Last year, all employees and technicians of Anshan Iron and Steel jointly proposed more than 19,000 rationalization proposals for improving production technology, management, or safety, of which more than 9,000 were adopted and played a significant role in production. In the third quarter of last year alone, the factories and mines affiliated with Anshan Iron and Steel Company implemented more than 800 suggestions from Soviet experts. For example, the steelmaking plant implemented the furnace baking system proposed by Soviet experts, shortening the downtime for each open hearth furnace repair, which is expected to increase the annual steel output by about 10,000 tons. Due to the resolute implementation of the Soviet experts' suggestions and the vigorous promotion of advanced experience, the production capacity of more than a dozen major equipment at Anshan Iron and Steel last year increased by about 20% compared to 1952. Especially after the launch of the production increase and savings competition in the entire plant last September, the production capacity of various equipment increased rapidly. For example, the utilization coefficient of blast furnaces in the ironmaking plant increased by 4.4% compared to the first half of the year, and the utilization coefficient of open hearth furnaces in the steelmaking plant increased by 8.3%. The increase in the utilization coefficient of various equipment can produce a lot more steel and other products for the country with the same equipment. As a result, from September to December last year, the monthly total value of production at Anshan Iron and Steel increased by 13.8% compared to the average monthly total value of production from January to August last year.

    鞍钢超额完成去年增产节约计划
   【新华社鞍山二十五日电】鞍山钢铁公司以超额百分之二十九点四完成了一九五三年的增产节约计划。去年鞍钢在生产上所达到的各种指标比一九五二年大大提高了。如去年的生产总值就较前年提高了四十点四八，劳动生产率提高了二十八点四五，成本降低了十二点三四。鞍钢去年供给全国各地一千多订货户的钢铁，也比一九五二年增加了百分之四十以上。
    鞍钢的全体职工在完成去年全年生产计划和增产节约计划的过程中，发挥了劳动创造性并认真向苏联学习。鞍钢全体职工和技术人员在去年一年中共提出了一万九千多件改进生产技术、管理或安全方面的合理化建议，其中有九千多件已被采纳，并在生产中起了很大作用。鞍山钢铁公司所属各厂矿单在去年第三季度中就贯彻执行了苏联专家建议八百多件。如炼钢厂执行了苏联专家提出的烘炉制度，缩短了每次修理平炉停火的时间，因而使全年钢的产量约可增加一万吨。由于坚决贯彻了苏联专家的建议和大力推广了先进经验，去年鞍钢十几种主要设备的生产能力都比一九五二年提高了百分之二十左右。尤其是在去年九月全厂开展增产节约竞赛以后，各种设备的生产能力更迅速提高了。如炼铁厂高炉的利用系数比上半年提高了百分之四点四，炼钢厂平炉的利用系数提高了百分之八点三。各种设备利用系数的提高，就可用同样的设备为国家多生产很多钢铁及其它产品。这样，去年九月到十二月鞍钢的每月生产总值，比去年一月到八月平均生产总值提高了百分之十三点八。
