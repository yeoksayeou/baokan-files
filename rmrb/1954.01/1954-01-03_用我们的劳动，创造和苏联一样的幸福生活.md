    Use Our Labor to Create a Happy Life Like in the Soviet Union
    Wei Yuxi, Industrial Labor Model of Liaoxi Province
    Last year, I participated in the Chinese Trade Union delegation to the Soviet Union and stayed there for a total of twenty days. In the Soviet Union, in addition to attending the grand celebration of the 36th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution, I also visited some modern factories, museums, collective farms, and schools. I personally witnessed the great achievements of Soviet communist construction, which further increased my confidence and sense of responsibility for the industrial construction of our motherland.
    From the factories and collective farms we visited, I was very excited about the high degree of mechanization, automation, and electrification of Soviet industrial and agricultural production. One automobile factory we visited could only produce 100 cars a day (24 hours) at the beginning of last year, but later it reached 150 cars a day. The Stalin Hardware Factory in Leningrad was a small factory before the October Revolution, only able to produce 1,500 kW generators, but now it can produce the world's largest 150,000 kW generator. The workload of giant machines in highly developed production is also very amazing. For example, the model of the dredger displayed in the Museum of Technology can excavate 1,000 to 1,500 cubic meters of soil per hour, which can replace the labor of 30,000 people. Seeing the great achievements of Soviet construction, and thinking of the comprehensive, long-term, and selfless assistance the Soviet Union provides us, has further increased my confidence in the socialist industrialization of our motherland.
    The development of Soviet industry has also mechanized agricultural production. We visited Stalinabad, the capital of the Tajik Soviet Socialist Republic. This republic was a very backward border mountainous area before the revolution, but now 98 percent of the arable land has been mechanized.
    In Moscow, I met one of the teachers of high-speed cutting, Bekov. When the translator introduced me to him as Wei Yuxi, an excellent lathe worker from China, he hugged me tightly. He said, "The Chinese brothers are remarkable. I believe you can successfully complete the first five-year plan."
    After visiting the Soviet Union, I saw a better prospect for our good life. In order to implement the general line of the state during the transition period, I must learn from the high labor enthusiasm of the Soviet people and contribute all my strength to the realization of the state's socialist industrialization.

    用我们的劳动，创造和苏联一样的幸福生活
    辽西省工业劳动模范　韦玉玺
    我去年参加中国工会赴苏观礼代表团，在苏联一共逗留了二十天。在苏联除了参加十月社会主义革命三十六周年的盛典以外，还参观了一些近代化工厂和一些博物馆、集体农庄、学校等。我亲眼看到了苏联共产主义建设的伟大成就，所以更增加了我对祖国工业建设的信心和责任感。
    从我们参观的一些工厂和集体农庄里，使我对苏联工农业生产的高度机械化、自动化与电气化的成就，感到非常兴奋。我们参观的一个汽车工厂，去年年初每天（二十四小时）还只能生产一百辆汽车，后来一天已达到一百五十辆了。列宁格勒的斯大林五金工厂，十月革命以前，还是一个小厂，只能出一千五百瓩的发电机，现在却可以生产世界上最大的十五万瓩发电机了。在高度生产发展中的巨型机器的工作量也是十分惊人的。如在多种技术博物馆里所陈列的挖泥机模型，这种挖土机一小时可以挖土一千到一千五百立方公尺，可以代替三万人的劳动。看到苏联建设的伟大成就，又联想到苏联对我们全面的、长期的、无私的援助，更增加了我对祖国社会主义工业化的信心。
    苏联工业的发展，使农业生产也机械化了。我们到过塔吉克苏维埃社会主义共和国首都斯大林纳巴德，这个加盟共和国在革命前还是一个很落后的边沿山区，可是现在百分之九十八的耕地已机械化了。
    在莫斯科我会见了高速切削的老师之一——贝科夫。当翻译同志给他介绍我是中国的优秀车工韦玉玺时，他紧紧地抱住我不放。他说：“中国弟兄是了不起的。我相信你们能胜利完成第一个五年计划。”
    我参观了苏联以后，更看到了我们美好生活的远景。为了执行国家过渡时期的总路线，我一定好好学习苏联人民高度的劳动热情，为实现国家社会主义工业化拿出自己的全部力量。
