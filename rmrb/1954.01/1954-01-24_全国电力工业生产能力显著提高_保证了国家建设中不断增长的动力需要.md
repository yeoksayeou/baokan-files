Xinhua News Agency, January 20th: The production capacity of the national electric power industry has greatly increased in the first year of the national Five-Year Plan. The new power generation capacity added through capital construction last year was equivalent to 19.2% of the original total power generation capacity of state-owned power plants. The production potential tapped from existing power generation equipment and conservation of electricity use also reached 120,000 kilowatts. The potential tapped alone is enough to supply more than seventy spinning mills with 50,000 spindles each. Therefore, the increase in power industry production capacity has powerfully guaranteed the growing power needs in the country's planned construction.

In 1953, the state-owned electric power industry overfulfilled its capital construction, production, and increased production and conservation plans. According to estimated figures: the capital construction plan for last year was completed by 103.18%, of which 19 major projects were completed by 111.59%. In terms of production, in addition to the overall overfulfillment of power generation, electricity sales, and various technical and economic indicators, the equipment utilization rate was 3.6% higher than planned, labor productivity was 3% higher than planned, and the total cost was 7.9% lower than planned. As a result of the increased production and conservation throughout the year, the net profit turned over to the state was enough to build two more power stations like the Zhengzhou Power Plant.

1953 was a year of rapid leap forward for the electric power industry from the recovery period to large-scale construction. In this year, the workload of newly built projects in the electric power industry accounted for more than half of the total workload. Among them, new power stations in Xi'an, Dihua, Zhengzhou, Chongqing, Taiyuan, and the more than 360-kilometer-long ultra-high voltage power transmission line in Northeast China were all newly built projects with highly complex technology and extremely heavy tasks. Under the enthusiastic guidance of Soviet experts and the active efforts of all employees, these projects overcame many difficulties last year, completed construction plans, gained construction experience, and cultivated batches of construction talents who can master advanced technologies. Among these projects, the large-scale Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant is currently under intense winter construction, and the Chongqing 507 Power Plant is expected to be put into production in April this year, and the Northeast Ultra-High Voltage Power Transmission Line can also be completed in the spring of this year. Xi'an, Dihua, Zhengzhou and other automated thermal power plants have started generating electricity successively last year. The timely commissioning of these power plants has further guaranteed the local industrial power consumption and promoted the advancement of other industrial construction. For example, in Zhengzhou City, the industrial power consumption in the fourth quarter of last year exceeded 10% of the city's original peak power load capacity due to the commissioning of expansion projects of some factories. At that time, the partial equipment of the newly built Zhengzhou Power Plant started supplying power, which guaranteed the supply of these newly added power consumption. Now that all the equipment of the newly built Zhengzhou Power Plant has been installed, the further development of Zhengzhou's emerging cotton textile industry and other light industries has been guaranteed with the necessary power.

Last year, the electric power industry also did a lot of work in ensuring safe and economic power generation and supply. For example, it put forward the "Draft of Technical Management Regulations for the Electric Power Industry" to ensure safe production, launched a safety competition among the vast number of employees to implement regulations and systems and improve operating skills, carried out planned maintenance based on equipment defects, initially improved the chaotic situation of the power consumption system, conducted night patrols and appraisals of some power distribution and lines, and assisted major users in inspecting power consumption equipment. These tasks have effectively improved the reliability of power generation and supply equipment, thereby ensuring safe power supply to industrial and mining enterprises. At the same time, electric power workers in various places actively improved boiler operating technology and combustion technology, thus saving more than 170,000 tons of coal compared with 1952; 1.35 million tons of low-value coal were burned throughout the year, saving the country 700,000 tons of standard coal. These have played a significant role in reducing electricity costs.

    全国电力工业生产能力显著提高
    保证了国家建设中不断增长的动力需要
   【新华社二十日讯】全国电力工业的生产能力，在国家五年建设计划的第一年中有了很大的增长。去年经过基本建设新增加的发电容量，就相当于国营电厂原有总发电容量的百分之十九点二；从原有发电设备和节约用电中挖掘出来的生产潜力，也达十二万瓩。光挖掘出来的潜力，就足可供七十多个五万纱锭的纱厂生产之用。因此，电业生产能力的增长，有力地保证了国家有计划建设中不断上涨的动力需要。
    一九五三年，国营电力工业的基本建设、生产和增产节约计划都已超额完成。根据预计数字：去年基本建设计划共完成百分之一百零三点一八，其中十九项主要工程完成百分之一百一十一点五九；生产方面，除发电量、售电量和各项技术经济指标都全面超额完成外，设备利用率比计划提高百分之三点六，劳动生产率比计划提高百分之三，总成本比计划降低百分之七点九。全年增产节约的结果，多上缴给国家的净利润就约可新建两个像郑州电厂一样的发电站。
    一九五三年是电力工业由恢复时期迅速跃进到大规模建设的一年。这一年，电力工业新建工程的工作量占总工作量的半数以上。其中如西安、迪化、郑州、重庆、太原等地的新电站和东北地区三百六十多公里长的超高压送电线等，都是技术高度复杂，任务十分繁重的新建工程。这些工程在苏联专家的热诚指导和全体职工的积极努力下，去年曾克服许多困难，完成建设计划，取得建设经验，并培养出了能掌握先进技术的成批的建设人才。在这些工程中，规模巨大的太原电热厂目前正在紧张进行冬季施工，重庆五零七电力厂预计可在今年四月投入生产，东北超高压送电线也可在今年春季完工。去年就已先后开始发电的有西安、迪化、郑州等自动化火力发电厂。这些发电厂的及时投入生产，更保证了当地工业用电，并带动了其他工业建设的前进。譬如在郑州市，去年第四季度因有部分工厂的扩建工程投入生产，使工业用电量超过了全市原有电力最高负荷能力百分之十。当时，新建郑州电厂的局部设备开始了送电，就保证了这些新增加用电量的供应。现在新建郑州电厂的全部设备已安装完成，郑州市新兴的棉纺工业和其他轻工业的进一步发展，就得到了必要的动力保证。
    去年电力工业在保证安全经济发供电方面，也做了很多工作。如提出了保证安全生产的“电力工业技术管理法规草案”，在广大职工中展开了贯彻规程制度、提高操作水平的安全竞赛，根据设备缺陷进行了计划检修，初步改进了用电系统的紊乱状况，对部分配电及线路作了夜间巡视、鉴定，协助主要用户进行了用电设备检查等。这些工作都有效地提高了发电和供电设备的可靠性，因而保证了对工矿企业的安全供电。同时，各地电业职工积极提高锅炉操作技术，改进燃烧技术，因此比一九五二年多节省了十七万多吨煤；全年烧用低值煤一百三十五万吨，为国家节省出七十万吨标准煤。这些对降低电力成本都起了很大作用。
