    The Political Department of the North China Military Region
    Has Dealt with Dong Wuning's Mistakes
    The Political Department of the North China Military Region wrote: After the People's Daily published reader Li Ruyi's letter in the "Excerpts from Readers' Letters" column on November 21, 1953, exposing Dong Wuning (erroneously written as Dong Wuning in the original letter), an assistant in the cadre department of our department, for apportioning expenses in his hometown to handle funeral affairs, our department sent a special person to Nanzhuzhuang, Second District, Ninghe County, to conduct an investigation. The handling situation is now reported to you as follows:
    Dong Wuning returned home on September 14 after learning that his mother was seriously ill. His mother had passed away on the 12th. The local area was a disaster area, and the farmers were busy with production and disaster relief. However, Dong Wuning, disregarding the local disaster situation and farmers' production, held a "memorial meeting" with more than 130 people attending after burying his mother, and engaged in extravagant waste and lavish eating and drinking, entertaining more than 70 guests. In addition to the coffin cost of 1.2 million yuan, which was agreed to be paid after the autumn harvest with the seller, he also borrowed 1.1 million yuan from the village's public funds. This behavior aroused the dissatisfaction of the local masses. Afterwards, Dong Wuning believed that agricultural collectivization would be implemented anyway in the future, so he decided to sell the existing eight mu and seven fen of land, which could be used to pay off debts and enjoy himself. In addition, there were four mu of public land in the village that was used by his family. After his mother's death, there was no one else in the family, and it should be returned to the village, but he planned to hire someone to cultivate it and obtain income without labor. In addition, before returning to the team, he sold the furniture in his home for 800,000 yuan, which he spent on his own without reporting to the organization after returning. This kind of self-serving and exploitative capitalist thinking of gaining without labor is absolutely incompatible with the Party's communist ideology.
    After repeated education by the Party organization and comrades, Dong Wuning has gradually realized his mistakes and is determined to correct them in the future. In order to educate Dong Wuning and all Party members, the branch decided to give him the punishment of being placed on probation within the Party for half a year.

### 华北军区政治部对董武宁的错误已作了处理

专栏：对人民日报读者批评建议的反应

    华北军区政治部
    对董武宁的错误已作了处理
    华北军区政治部来信：一九五三年十一月二十一日人民日报“读者来信摘要”栏刊载了读者李如意揭发我部干部部助理员董武宁（原批评信中误为董伍宁）回乡摊款治丧的来信后，我部就派专人到宁河县二区南珠庄作了调查，现将处理情况告诉你们：
    董武宁知道母亲病重后，就在九月十四日回家。他母亲已于十二日病故。当地是灾区，农民正忙于生产救灾。但董武宁不顾当地灾情和农民生产，在埋葬母亲后举行了有一百三十多人参加的“追念大会”，并铺张浪费大吃大喝，请客七十多人。除棺材费一百二十万元与卖主议定秋后付款外，又借用村内公款一百十万元。这种行为引起当地群众的不满。事后，董武宁认为将来反正要实行农业集体化，就决定将现有的八亩七分土地卖掉，除还账外还可自己享受。另有四亩村中给他家使用的公地，其母死后家中再无别人，理应归还本村，但他却打算雇人耕种，不劳而获。此外，他于回队前曾将家中的家具卖得八十万元，回来后未报告组织，自行花掉。这种损公利己和不劳而获的剥削阶级思想，是与党的共产主义思想绝不相容的。
    经过党组织与同志们的一再教育，董武宁已逐渐认识自己的错误，并决心在今后改正。为了教育董武宁及所有党员，支部决定给他留党察看半年的处分。
