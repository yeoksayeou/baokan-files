Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 8th: A special correspondent of this news agency reports: When the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission was discussing the "Interim Report" to be submitted to both parties of the Korean Armistice Agreement, the Swiss and Swedish members once believed that "there is no reason to make such a report before the work of this committee is completed." However, after the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission passed the "Interim Report" by a majority vote, the Swiss and Swedish members immediately believed it was "necessary" to submit a so-called "individual report." They attempted to use this "individual report" to conceal and cover up the U.S. side's activities of delaying and sabotaging the explanation work listed in the "Interim Report" and to exonerate the U.S. side from responsibility.

However, the iron facts make this report have to expose some of the U.S. side's obstruction and sabotage of the explanation work.

The report of the Swiss and Swedish members actually had to admit every act of sabotage and obstruction by the U.S. side pointed out in the "Interim Report" passed by the majority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, but its vague wording and ambiguous statements provided cover for the U.S. side.

The report admits that when the U.S. side transferred the prisoners of war to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, it had misinterpreted the "Scope of Authority" in an attempt to prohibit the observing representatives of the Korean and Chinese sides from being present to observe. However, the report deliberately omits the arguments of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission refuting the U.S. side's unreasonable demands.

The report also admits that the prisoners of war handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission by the U.S. side had "insufficient understanding" of the "Scope of Authority," and the U.S. side unreasonably protested against the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission distributing leaflets explaining the "Scope of Authority" to the prisoners of war. The report distortedly defended the U.S. side's barbaric act of interfering with the work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, saying that "this protest was based on an incorrect English re-translation of the Chinese version of the leaflet." However, this defense obviously cannot offset the U.S. side's clear expression of opposition to the repatriation of prisoners of war in the protest.

The report admits that the U.S. side had protested against the "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visitation Work" passed by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, but it described the matter in a very understated manner, completely omitting Clark's letter to Thimayya on October 5, 1953, and Thimayya's reply to Clark on October 7, in an attempt to conceal the essence of the U.S. protest—not allowing prisoners of war to have the opportunity and freedom to apply for repatriation, while also concealing the fact that prisoners of war were under the force and threat of force of U.S. special agents and were deprived of the freedom to apply for repatriation.

The report also admits that the U.S. side first deliberately delayed the construction of explanation facilities and then opposed extending the explanation period. It admits that one of the reasons for the U.S. side's delay in constructing the explanation facilities was that the construction site designated by the Korean and Chinese sides "may have landmines," but it only said that the Korean and Chinese sides "emphasized that as far as they knew, no landmines had been laid in the area," and completely failed to mention the U.S. side's guarantee at the Military Armistice Commission that there were no landmines in the demilitarized zone. The report admits that on October 3, the U.S. side "estimated that it would take a week to complete a temporary area with twenty tents, twenty days to complete the first permanent area, and another thirty days to complete the second permanent area." The Swiss and Swedish members did not comment on this deliberate delaying lie of the U.S. side. And for the fact that the U.S. side, under the pressure of public opinion, finally completed the construction work that the U.S. side originally said would take dozens of days to complete overnight, the report only simply said: "The United Nations Command finally completed these constructions on October 13," using this ambiguous statement to make it seem as if the U.S. side did not delay the construction, but rather勉力 completed these constructions.

The Swiss and Swedish members felt that this was not enough, and specially added a paragraph to the report, attempting to shift the responsibility for delaying the start of the explanation work to the Korean and Chinese sides. This paragraph says: "In retrospect, and based on the experience of conducting explanation work in South Camp, the Committee realized that the explanation facilities originally built would not be satisfactory due to the narrowness of the place, but during the completion of the new site, the explanation work could still have been carried out on a limited scale using these facilities." The conclusion of the report also says that the delay in the start of the explanation was "because the material equipment prepared for explanation in South Camp was not accepted by the explanation party."

Just by looking at the "Interim Report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," one can see that the arguments of the Swiss and Swedish members are not a fair attitude but a biased attitude. The "Interim Report" points out: "The explanation facilities originally built by the United Nations Command would be completely unsuitable. These facilities were too cramped in space. Conducting explanations in these facilities, it would be impossible not to be seriously disturbed by the noise and violence of the prisoners of war." The Swiss and Swedish members seem to think that the U.S. side's unreasonable delay in construction was justified, while the Korean and Chinese sides' refusal to conduct explanations in facilities built according to the U.S. side's plan to sabotage the explanation was not justified.

The Swiss and Swedish members admitted: "It is a fact that the prisoners of war were organized upon arrival," and this organization "was obviously for political purposes." "These organizations had strict control over the prisoners of war who requested repatriation, so the latter often had to secretly and at the risk of their lives apply for repatriation." "In fact, several murders had occurred in South Camp." "Several letters intercepted in South Camp, transmitted from one camp to another, and even from various camps to the outside, have further shown that there are some powerful organizations in the prisoner of war camps."

However, the Swiss and Swedish members insisted that the situation in North Camp was the same as in South Camp, as if "all crows under the sky are equally black," so the U.S. side's crime of directing special agents to sabotage the explanation work and persecute and murder prisoners of war could be disregarded. But what they said was only that "during the explanation, the actions and demeanor of the prisoners of war in North Camp were exactly the same." And what exactly were the actions and demeanor of the prisoners of war in North Camp? The report of the Swiss and Swedish members admits: The prisoners of war "agreed to segregation" and "the explanation proceeded smoothly without interruption." If North Camp also had a special agent organization like South Camp, why did the prisoners of war in North Camp agree to segregation while the prisoners of war in South Camp did not? Why was the explanation work in North Camp able to proceed smoothly without interruption, while South Camp at most only continued for three days? The Swiss and Swedish members did not explain this question.

The Swiss and Swedish members also admitted that the termination of the explanation work in North Camp was not because the prisoners of war were unwilling to listen to the explanation, but because they asked the U.S. side to explain more about matters related to their return home. Their report said: "The prisoners of war have always expressed their desire to speak and to explain to the explanation representatives (reporter's note: actually, they requested the explanation representatives to provide more adequate explanations), but the explanation representatives did not agree to this, and when the prisoners of war insisted, they terminated the explanation."

The Swiss and Swedish members admitted that the prisoners of war in South Camp were under the control of a powerful terrorist organization and were threatened with violence by special agents, but they cited the Geneva Convention to oppose breaking up the special agent organization and to oppose using force to sanction special agents who coerced and murdered prisoners of war with violence when necessary. They said: "According to the general spirit of the Geneva Convention, prisoners of war should be allowed to continue to maintain their organized state," that is to say, special agent organizations among prisoners of war should be allowed to continue to control prisoners of war. What does this have in common with the general spirit of the Geneva Convention? The general spirit of the Geneva Convention is to ensure that prisoners of war are given humanitarian treatment and to protect all their rights, including the right to repatriation. Article 3 of the treaty clearly stipulates that prisoners of war, "at any time and in any place," shall not be subjected to "violence to life and person, in particular murder of all kinds, mutilation, cruel treatment and torture"; shall not be subjected to "outrages upon personal dignity, in particular humiliating and degrading treatment." Article Seven of the Convention stipulates: "Prisoners of war may in no circumstances renounce in part or in entirety the rights secured to them by the present Convention, or by the special agreements referred to in the preceding Article, if such there be." The Swiss and Swedish members now admit that special agent organizations in South Camp are abusing and murdering prisoners of war and preventing prisoners of war from being repatriated, but say that such organizations should be allowed to exist. How far is this from the general spirit of the Geneva Convention!

Similarly, the Swiss and Swedish members' use of the Geneva Convention to oppose the use of force against special agents is also untenable. They do not allow the use of force against special agents, and the Swiss members even threatened to withdraw from the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, but they do not allow sanctions to be imposed on special agents who use force against prisoners of war. Although they also said, "The Commander of the Indian Custodial Force should do everything possible to prevent and suppress acts of violence and to punish those who can be proven to have committed such acts," they are determined to preserve the root of all these violent acts—the special agent violence organization.

From the many facts admitted in the report of the Swiss and Swedish members, one can only draw one conclusion, that is, the reason why the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese sides could not proceed normally was initially due to the obstruction and delay of the U.S. side, and later due to the sabotage of the special agent organizations in the camp directed by the U.S. side. However, the Swiss and Swedish members made a strange conclusion, saying that "the subsequent interruption of the explanation work was mostly due to the explanation party's attitude towards the conduct of the explanation and the prisoners of war's attitude towards the explanation." According to them, on the one hand, it was "the repeated changes in the explanation party's method of conducting the explanation," and on the other hand, it was "the cooperation of the prisoners of war," which had "become a decisive factor in conducting the explanation."

Obviously, these two aspects do not exist for the U.S. side's explanation work. As the report admits, the U.S. side's explanation work "proceeded smoothly without interruption," and the prisoners of war did not refuse to listen to the explanation but "requested long explanations," which is an extremely favorable condition if the U.S. side wants to persuade their prisoners of war to be repatriated. However, the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese sides was indeed constantly changing its plans because the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission could not bring out the prisoners of war to listen to the explanation, and it was subjected to sabotage and disruption by special agents during the explanation work, while also being obstructed by the Swiss and Swedish members.

From the report of the Swiss and Swedish members, people can see very clearly that the basic problem in the entire work of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission is the problem of ensuring the thorough implementation of the "Scope of Authority," and not, as the Swiss and Swedish members said, merely "the problem of the use of force against prisoners of war." And the Swiss and Swedish members obviously bear a large part of the responsibility for the failure to thoroughly implement the "Scope of Authority." Their report cannot exonerate the U.S. side from responsibility.

### 新华社记者评瑞士瑞典委员的“个别报告”  瑞士瑞典委员妄图歪曲事实掩饰美方破坏解释的罪行  “职权范围”未能彻底实施瑞士瑞典委员应负很大责任

    新华社记者评瑞士瑞典委员的“个别报告”
    瑞士瑞典委员妄图歪曲事实掩饰美方破坏解释的罪行
    “职权范围”未能彻底实施瑞士瑞典委员应负很大责任
    【新华社开城八日电】　本社特派记者报道：在中立国遣返委员会讨论提交朝鲜停战缔约双方的“临时报告”的时候，瑞士、瑞典委员曾经认为“不能找到任何理由在本委员会的工作结束之前作这样一个报告”。可是在中立国遣返委员会以多数票通过“临时报告”以后，瑞士、瑞典委员却立刻认为“有必要”提出一个所谓“个别报告”了。他们企图以这个“个别报告”来隐瞒和掩饰“临时报告”中所列举的美方拖延和破坏解释工作的活动，替美方开脱责任。
    但是铁的事实却使这个报告不能不暴露美方拖延和破坏解释工作的一部分情况。
    瑞士、瑞典委员的报告实际上不得不承认了中立国遣返委员会多数通过的“临时报告”中所指出的美方的每一项破坏阻挠行为，但是它的含混不清的词句和模棱两可的说法却给美方打了掩护。
    这个报告承认，美方在将战俘移交中立国遣返委员会看管时，曾经曲解“职权范围”，企图禁止朝中方面的观察代表到场观察。但是报告却故意将中立国遣返委员会驳斥美方无理要求的论据略而不谈。
    这个报告也承认，美方移交给中立国遣返委员会的战俘对“职权范围”“了解不足”，而美方又无理地抗议中立国遣返委员会向战俘散发说明“职权范围”的传单。这个报告曲意替美方这种干涉中立国遣返委员会工作的横蛮行为辩护，说什么“这个抗议所根据的是该项传单的中译本的一个不正确的英文重译本”。但是这种辩护显然不能抵销美方在抗议中反对战俘遣返的明确表示。
    这个报告承认美方曾经抗议中立国遣返委员会所通过的“解释和访问工作细则”，可是它把事情说得十分轻描淡写，把克拉克在一九五三年十月五日给蒂迈雅的信和蒂迈雅十月七日给克拉克的复信完全不提，企图这样来隐瞒美方抗议的实质——不让战俘有申请遣返的机会和自由，同时又隐瞒了战俘是处在美方特务的武力和武力威胁之下、被剥夺了申请遣返的自由的事实。
    这个报告还承认了美方先则故意拖延修建解释设备，后来又反对延长解释期限。它承认美方拖延修建解释设备的理由之一是朝中方面指定的修建地点“可能有地雷”，可是它只说朝中方面“强调说就他们所知该地区并未敷设地雷”，而完全不提美方在军事停战委员会上提出的非军事区内已无地雷的保证。这个报告承认，美方在十月三日“估计需要一个星期来完成一个设有二十个帐篷的临时地区，二十天完成第一个永久地区，再要三十天完成第二个永久地区”。对于美方这种故意拖延的谎话，瑞士、瑞典委员没有加以任何评论。而对于美方在舆论压力下终于在一夜之间就完成了美方原说要几十天才能完成的修建工作的事实，这个报告却只简单的说：“联合国军最后于十月十三日完成了这些修建”，用这种含糊的说法，把事情说得好像美方并不是拖延了修建，而是勉力完成了这些修建似的。
    瑞士、瑞典委员觉得这样还不够，特地在报告中加上了一段，企图把解释工作拖延开始的责任推在朝中方面身上。这一段说：“在回顾时，并根据在南营进行解释工作的经验，本委员会意识到原来所修建的解释设备由于地方太窄小，是不会令人满意的，但在完成新场所期间，解释工作原仍可以利用这些设备在有限的规模上进行的。”这个报告的结论部分还说，解释开始的拖延，“是因为南营准备好的供解释用的物质设备未为解释一方所接受”。
    只要看一看“中立国遣返委员会临时报告”，就可以知道瑞士、瑞典委员的论点不是一种公正的态度而是偏袒的态度。“临时报告”指出：“联合国军原来修建的解释设备会是完全不适合的，这些设备在空间上太挤。在这些设备里进行解释，想不受战俘喧嚣与暴行的最严重的扰乱是不可能的。”瑞士、瑞典委员似乎认为美方毫无道理地拖延修建是应该的，而朝中方面拒绝在按照美方破坏解释的计划修建起来的设备中进行解释，倒是不应该的。
    瑞士、瑞典委员承认：“战俘到达时是有组织的，这是事实”，而且这种组织“显而易见地是为了政治目的”。“这些组织对要求遣返的战俘控制很严，因此后者常常不得不秘密地并冒着生命危险来申请遣返”。“事实上南营里曾发生了好几起凶杀案”。“在南营内截获的由一个营场传递到另一营场的甚至有由各营与外界往来的几封信件，已进一步显示出战俘营内有些强有力的组织存在”。
    但是瑞士、瑞典委员却硬说北营也存在和南营一样的情况，好像“天下乌鸦一般黑”，因此美方指挥特务破坏解释工作、迫害谋杀战俘的罪行就可以不必计较似的。但他们所说的只是“在解释的期间，北营战俘的行动举止都是一模一样的”。而北营战俘的行动举止究竟是怎样的呢？瑞士、瑞典委员的报告承认：战俘“同意隔离”“解释毫无中断地顺利进行”。如果北营也像南营一样有着特务组织，为什么北营战俘同意隔离而南营战俘不同意呢？为什么北营解释工作能够毫无中断地顺利进行，而南营却最多也只不过连续进行了三天呢？瑞士、瑞典委员没有说明这个问题。
    瑞士、瑞典委员还承认，北营解释工作的终止并不是由于战俘不愿听解释，而是由于他们要求美方更多地解释有关他们回家的事项。他们的报告说：“战俘一直表示他们要发言，并要向解释代表进行解释（记者按：实际上是要求解释代表作更多的充分的解释），但是解释代表不答应这样，当战俘坚持时，他们便终止了解释。”
    瑞士、瑞典委员承认了南营战俘处于强有力的恐怖组织的控制之下，受到特务分子的暴力威胁，可是他们却举日内瓦公约来反对打散特务组织，反对在必要时对以暴力胁迫并屠杀战俘的特务分子使用武力加以制裁。他们说：“依照日内瓦公约的总的精神，应准许战俘继续保持有组织状态”，也就是说，应当准许战俘中的特务组织继续控制战俘。试问这与日内瓦公约的总的精神有什么共同之处？日内瓦公约的总的精神就是要保证给予战俘以人道主义的待遇，保障他们的包括遣返权利在内的一切权利。该条约第三条明白规定，对战俘，“不论何时何地”，不得“对生命与人身施以暴力，特别如各种谋杀、残伤肢体、虐待及酷刑”；不得“损害个人尊严，特别如侮辱与降低身份的待遇”。该公约第七条规定：“在任何情况下战俘不得放弃本公约或上条所述特别协定——如其订有是项协定——所赋予彼等权利之一部或全部。”瑞士、瑞典委员现在承认南营中的特务组织虐杀战俘、阻止战俘遣返，却说应当准许这种组织存在，这与日内瓦公约的总的精神相去何止十万八千里！
    同样，瑞士、瑞典委员用日内瓦公约来反对对特务使用武力，也是站不住脚的。他们不许对特务使用武力，瑞士委员甚至不惜以退出中立国遣返委员会相威胁，可是对于特务对战俘使用武力，他们却不许加以制裁。他们虽然也说，“印度看管部队司令应尽一切可能努力防止和压制暴力行为，并对那些能被证明犯有此种行为者予以处罚。”可是他们却坚决要保存这一切暴力行为的根源——特务暴力组织。
    从瑞士、瑞典委员的报告所承认的许多事实，人们只能得出一个唯一的结论，这就是朝中方面解释工作之所以不能正常进行，起初是由于美方的阻挠和拖延，后来是由于美方所指挥的营场中的特务组织的破坏。可是瑞士、瑞典委员却作出了奇怪的结论，说什么“以后解释工作的中断，大部分是由于解释一方对解释的进行和战俘们对于解释的态度”。按照他们的说法，一方面，是“解释一方进行解释工作方法的一再更改”，另一方面，是“已成为进行解释中的一个决定性因素”的“战俘的合作”。
    很明显，这两方面对于美方的解释工作都是不存在的。正如这个报告所承认的，美方解释工作是“毫无中断地顺利进行的”，战俘不是拒绝听解释而是“要求长的解释”，如果美方要说服他们的战俘遣返，这是一个极端有利的条件。但是朝中方面的解释工作却的确因为中立国遣返委员会不能带出战俘来听取解释，而曾经不断改变解释工作的计划，并且在解释工作进行中遭到特务的破坏和捣乱，同时又受到瑞士、瑞典委员的阻挠。
    从瑞士、瑞典委员的报告，人们可以看得很清楚，中立国遣返委员会整个工作中的基本问题是保证“职权范围”彻底实施的问题，而不是如瑞士、瑞典委员所说的仅仅是“对战俘使用武力的问题”。而“职权范围”之所以未能彻底实施，瑞士、瑞典委员显然要负很大的一部分责任。他们的报告是不能替美方开脱责任的。
