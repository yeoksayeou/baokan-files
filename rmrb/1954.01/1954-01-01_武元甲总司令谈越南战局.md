　　Commander-in-Chief Vo Nguyen Giap Discusses the Vietnam War Situation
　　Xinhua News Agency Reporters Du Zhanchao and Xiao Guang

　　I. First Visit with Commander-in-Chief Vo Nguyen Giap

　　It was already mid-December, but the mountainous areas of North Vietnam were still a lush green.

　　We often waded through murmuring streams, passed by creaking water mills, and walked along rice paddies where seedlings were being planted before turning onto hillsides covered with various tropical plants. After walking up and down and winding around for a long time, we finally arrived at the General Headquarters of the Vietnam People's Army.

　　In a spacious house built of bamboo, we met General Vo Nguyen Giap. The Commander-in-Chief of the Vietnam People's Army, familiar to peace-loving people all over the world, looked as serene as he often appeared in photographs. He was wearing a set of light yellow military uniform. He smiled and shook hands with us.

　　Outside the General Headquarters' conference room were tall clusters of palm trees, their leaves spread out like large round fans. Inside the conference room, on the bamboo-woven walls, hung photographs of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, Chairman Mao Zedong, and Chairman Malenkov. From the ceiling hung an electric lamp with a lampshade made of local paper. General Vo Nguyen Giap unfolded a military map on the blue-covered conference table and began to introduce the war situation in Vietnam to us.

　　When we visited Commander-in-Chief Vo Nguyen Giap, the Vietnam People's Army was achieving new victories in the Red River Delta and the Mekong Delta, and actively launching attacks against the enemy entrenched in Lai Chau and Dien Bien Phu. In just a few days, by the time we finished our visit, the Vietnam People's Army had already entered Lai Chau City.

　　This commander of the Vietnam People's Army was born in 1912 in a peasant family in Quang Binh Province in central Vietnam and began participating in revolutionary activities at a very young age. In the winter of 1944, following the instructions of the Indochinese Communist Party (the predecessor of the Vietnam Workers' Party) and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, he organized the first Vietnamese people's army in the mountainous areas of North Vietnam. From then on, he began his military life.

　　Commander-in-Chief Vo Nguyen Giap said: "We were born loving peace, but we will never allow others to hold a knife to our necks." In order to eliminate the invading army holding a knife to the necks of the Vietnamese people and to strive for national independence and peace, Commander-in-Chief Vo Nguyen Giap led the Vietnam People's Army in a heroic resistance war for ten years.

　　II. The Basic Factor Determining the Victory or Defeat of the War

　　After reviewing the entire course of the Vietnamese resistance war, General Vo Nguyen Giap said that although there are many factors determining the victory or defeat of a war, the most basic factor is the people.

　　"Because our resistance war is just and belongs to the people, we have continuously achieved victories."

　　"Because the French colonialists and the American interventionists are carrying out an unjust and anti-people war of aggression, they have suffered continuous defeats."

　　Since the French colonialists launched the war of aggression in Vietnam, they have replaced their commander-in-chief six times, and even two of France's "three great generals"—Leclerc and de Lattre de Tassigny—have suffered disgraceful defeats on the Vietnamese battlefield.

　　This is definitely not a problem of any one individual, but the result of the nature of the war.

　　Shortly after the establishment of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam was proclaimed, the French invading army landed in South Vietnam. At that time, the Vietnamese people's armed forces were still very young and their equipment was very poor, especially in the south. Leclerc, the then commander-in-chief of the French invading army, arrogantly declared that he would solve the problem of South Vietnam in three days, and later claimed that he would solve the problem of South Vietnam in ten weeks, but in the end, he had to publicly admit that reoccupying Vietnam was no easy task. He said helplessly: "There is no way, people are rising up everywhere to fight you!" Soon, he was replaced.

　　Since then, the French invading army has continuously increased its military pressure on South Vietnam. However, to this day, the French invading army has no way to control that area. Main forces, local forces, and guerrillas of the Vietnam People's Army are active everywhere in the Mekong Delta, and have established guerrilla base areas and guerrilla zones, among which guerrilla base areas such as Ta Mei, Tong Nai, Yang Mingzhu, and Chuan Mu all cover areas of more than 1,000 square kilometers. These guerrilla base areas and guerrilla zones echo each other, forming a siege on Saigon, the military and political center of the French invading army.

　　The French colonialists based their military plans on arrogance and self-importance. They could not see that behind the young Vietnam People's Army was a nation that had been baptized by the August Revolution, a nation that had awakened, a nation that had solemnly declared its independence to the world.

　　The Vietnam People's Army grew rapidly in battle. They won the Border Campaign, the Hoa Binh Campaign, and the Northwest Campaign, annihilating large numbers of French invading troops, gaining military initiative, and linking the North Vietnam Liberated Area and the Central Vietnam Liberated Area into one.

　　Due to geographical, historical relations, and shared destiny, the peoples of Vietnam, Cambodia, and Laos, who live on the Indochina Peninsula, are closely united against a common enemy. Every victory of the Vietnamese people's armed forces directly promotes the new development of the struggle of the Cambodian and Laotian people; every struggle of the Cambodian and Laotian people has a significant impact on the Vietnamese people's war of resistance. In the spring of 1953, the Lao People's Liberation Army launched the Upper Laos Campaign, annihilating a large number of French invading troops and liberating large areas of Upper Laos. The results of this campaign were not only beneficial to Laos, but also to the Vietnamese war of resistance, because the Upper Laos region of Laos is located right next to the northwest and central liberated areas of Vietnam.

　　III. Protracted, Arduous, and Victory Will Certainly Be Achieved!

　　Talking about the current war situation in Vietnam, Commander-in-Chief Vo Nguyen Giap said: "I think, Navarre's fate will not be good either."

　　Navarre, who succeeded de Lattre de Tassigny and Salan as commander-in-chief of the French invading army, took office with the strong support of the American interventionists. Since Navarre took office as commander-in-chief of the French invading army half a year ago, the American interventionists have repeatedly provided the French invading army with hundreds of millions of US dollars in "aid," which is much larger than the numbers in previous years. Large quantities of American-made weapons are being shipped to Indochina. In addition, a large number of American military and political dignitaries, officers, and even air force mechanics have come to Indochina in an endless stream for "visits," "inspections," "training," and "guidance."

　　But no matter how the French colonialists and the American interventionists struggle, they will inevitably suffer defeat.

　　Since Navarre came to Indochina in May 1953, he has suffered a series of defeats.

　　As soon as Navarre took office, he airdropped more than 1,000 paratroopers in the Lang Son area of North Vietnam, attempting to surprise the rear of the Vietnam People's Army; but as soon as these paratroopers landed, they encountered fierce attacks from local troops, militia, and guerrillas of the Vietnam People's Army, suffered heavy losses, and fled in panic. Even French newspapers said: "This is a stupid action with no military value!"

　　Navarre's second action was to use aircraft to evacuate the French and puppet troops besieged in Na San, concentrating their forces in the Nam Dinh, Kien An, and Hung Yen areas of the Red River Delta to carry out "pacification sweeps" by district, but each "sweep" was crushed by the Vietnam People's Army's rear troops and guerrillas.

　　Navarre's third action was the so-called "Seagull Campaign" launched in the Ninh Binh and Thanh Hoa areas in mid-October. Navarre touted this action as "the largest offensive since the Indochina War" to show off to US Vice President Nixon and to cheer up the Bao Dai puppet "National Congress" that was being held at the time. As a result, Navarre suffered a great loss and suffered heavy casualties.

　　Navarre is now facing the dilemma of robbing Peter to pay Paul. Just as the French invading army was carrying out the "Seagull Campaign," the Vietnam People's Army took the opportunity to eliminate more than 2,000 armed bandits scattered in the Son La area, completely exposing the enemy troops in Lai Chau to the Vietnam People's Army. In order to save the crisis in the Northwest, Navarre had to airlift four battalions of troops from the tense Red River Delta to Dien Bien Phu on the Vietnam-Laos border. But it was already too late. Under the coercion of the Vietnam People's Army and guerrillas, the French invading army had to abandon the important northwest town of Lai Chau, making Dien Bien Phu isolated again.

　　The same fate of Leclerc, de Lattre de Tassigny, and others is awaiting Navarre.

　　Commander-in-Chief Vo Nguyen Giap looked forward to the war situation in Vietnam. He quoted Chairman Ho Chi Minh's words and said: "The war of resistance will certainly be victorious, but it must be protracted, arduous, and self-reliant."

　　This is Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to the people of the whole country, and it is also the strategic policy of the Vietnam People's Army. In recent years, the Vietnam People's Army has achieved great military victories. The Vietnam People's Army knows that the French imperialists are unwilling to fail, and the American imperialists are stepping up their intervention and continuing to expand the war of aggression.

　　The Vietnam People's Army, which is getting stronger and stronger in the war, is shouldering the arduous task of a protracted struggle. But everyone is full of confidence in victory. They know very well that the war of aggression brings unfavorable factors to the enemy, which the enemy cannot eliminate; on the contrary, the people's army has many favorable factors. These factors are constantly growing in the war, gradually changing the situation of the enemy being strong and we being weak in the early stage of the war of resistance, and will continue to grow with the development of the war in the future.

　　Commander-in-Chief Vo Nguyen Giap finally concluded his talk by saying: "Because we have a heroic people, a people's army, and the sympathy and support of peace-loving people all over the world, under the leadership of the Labor Party and Chairman Ho Chi Minh, our war of resistance will surely be victorious."

    武元甲总司令谈越南战局
    新华社记者　杜展潮　萧光
      一、初访武元甲总司令
    已经是十二月中旬了，北越的山区里却还是一片绿色。
    我们时常涉过潺潺的流水，从咿哑作响的水磨旁边经过，在播种着秧苗的田边上走了一段之后，又转到生长着各种各样热带植物的山坡上。这样上下、曲折地走了好久，最后到达了越南人民军总司令部。
    在一座宽敞的、用竹子修筑成的屋子里，我们会见了武元甲将军。这位为全世界爱好和平人民所熟悉的越南人民军总司令，好像常在照片里见到的那样，显得十分安祥。他穿着一套淡黄色的军服。他微笑着和我们握手。
    总司令部的会议室外面是高大的葵树丛，葵叶像一把把大圆扇似的张开着。会议室里，在用竹片织成图案的墙壁上，挂着胡志明主席、毛泽东主席和马林科夫主席的相片，两边是几幅军事地图，从屋顶下垂着一盏用土纸做罩子的电灯。武元甲将军在铺着蓝布的会议桌上，展开一幅军事地图，开始向我们介绍越南的战争形势。
    当我们访问武元甲总司令的时候，越南人民军正在红河三角洲和湄公河三角洲取得新的胜利，并积极地向盘踞在莱州和奠边府的敌人展开攻击。短短的几天中，当我们结束访问时，越南人民军已经进入了莱州城。
    这位越南人民军的统帅，一九一二年诞生在越南中部广平省一个农民家庭里，很早就开始参加革命活动。一九四四年冬天，他遵照东洋共产党（即越南劳动党的前身）和胡志明主席的指示，在北越的山区里组织第一支越南人民的军队。从那时起，他便开始了军事生活。
    武元甲总司令说：“我们生来就酷爱和平，但是我们绝不允许别人拿刀架在我们脖子上。”为了消灭拿刀架在越南人民脖子上的侵略军，争取民族独立与和平，武元甲总司令领导越南人民军进行英勇的抗战，十年如一日。
    二、决定战争胜负的基本因素
    回顾越南抗战的全部进程之后，武元甲将军说：决定战争胜负的因素虽然很多，但是最基本的一个因素就是人民。
    “因为我们的抗战是正义的，是人民的，所以我们不断地获得胜利。”
    “因为法国殖民者和美国干涉者进行的侵略战争，是非正义的，是反人民的，所以他们连续不断地遭受到失败。”
    法国殖民者在越南发动侵略战争以来，共更换了六次总司令，连法国“三大名将”中的两个——勒克莱克和塔西尼，也都在越南战场上遭到了可耻的失败。
    这绝不是那一个人的问题，而是战争性质所导致的结果。
    越南民主共和国宣告成立不久，法国侵略军便在南越登陆进犯。当时，越南人民的武装力量还很幼小，装备也很差，尤其是南部更差。当时的法国侵略军总司令勒克莱克狂妄地宣称要在三天内解决越南南部问题，后来又宣称要在十个星期内解决越南南部问题，但是最后他也不得不公开地承认：重新占领越南已经不是一件容易的事。他一筹莫展地说：“没有办法，什么地方都有人起来和你打！”不久，他便被撤换了。
    从那时候起，法国侵略军不断地增强对越南南部的军事压力。但是，直到现在，法国侵略军还没有办法控制那个地区。湄公河三角洲到处都有越南人民军主力部队、地方部队和游击队在活动着，并且建立起一块块游击根据地和游击区，其中如同塔梅、同耐、杨明珠、川木等游击根据地，面积都在一千平方公里以上。这些游击根据地和游击区互相呼应着，形成对法国侵略军的军事和政治中心西贡的包围形势。
    法国殖民者把它的军事计划建立在狂妄自大的基础上。它看不见站在年轻的越南人民军后面，是一个受过八月革命洗礼、觉醒了的民族，一个曾经庄严地向全世界宣告独立了的民族。
    越南人民军在战斗中迅速地成长和壮大起来。他们打胜了边界战役、和平战役、西北战役等，歼灭了大批法国侵略军，取得了军事主动权，并使北越解放区和中部解放区联成一片。
    因为地理的、历史的关系和共同的命运，使得生活在印度支那半岛的越南、高棉和寮国人民紧密地团结在一起，反对共同的敌人。越南人民武装每一胜利，都直接推动高棉和寮国人民的斗争得到新的发展；高棉和寮国人民每一个斗争，又都对越南人民的抗战发生重大的影响。一九五三年春天，寮国人民解放军开展了上寮战役，歼灭了大量的法国侵略军，解放了上寮地区大块的土地。这次战役的结果，不仅对寮国，而且对越南抗战也是很有利的，因为紧靠着越南西北部和中部解放区的，正是寮国的上寮地区。
    三、长期、艰苦，一定胜利！
    谈到越南目前的战局，武元甲总司令说：“我想，纳瓦尔的命运也不会好的。”
    继塔西尼和萨兰之后出任法国侵略军总司令的纳瓦尔，是在美国干涉者极力支持下任职的。自从纳瓦尔出任法国侵略军总司令这半年来，美国干涉者已一再给予法国侵略军成亿美元的“援助”，比前几年的数目大的多。大量的美国制的武器正运到印度支那。此外，美国大批军政要员、军官乃至空军机械士，曾络绎不绝地前来印度支那“访问”、
  “视察”、“训练”和“指导”。
    但是不管法国殖民者和美国干涉者作怎样的挣扎，都不可免地遭受到失败。
    纳瓦尔自从一九五三年五月来到印度支那以后，吃了一连串的败仗。
    纳瓦尔刚走马上任，就在北越谅山地区空降一千多名伞兵，企图出其不意地袭击越南人民军的后方；但是当这些伞兵刚着地就遇到越南人民军地方部队和民兵、游击队猛烈的攻击，受到惨重的损失而仓皇逃走。连法国报纸都说：“这是一次毫无军事价值的愚蠢行动！”
    纳瓦尔第二个行动，就是用飞机把被围困在那产的法军和伪军撤出来，集中兵力在红河三角洲的南定、建安、兴安等地区，分区进行“绥靖扫荡”，结果每一次“扫荡”都被越南人民军敌后部队和游击队粉碎了。
    纳瓦尔第三个行动，就是十月中旬在宁平、清化地区发动的所谓“海鸥战役”。纳瓦尔把这次行动吹嘘成为“印度支那战争以来最大的一次攻势”，摆样子给美国副总统尼克松看，并给当时召开的保大伪“国民大会”打气。结果，纳瓦尔吃了一个大亏，损失惨重。
    纳瓦尔现在正面临着拆东墙补西墙的困境，正当法国侵略军进行“海鸥战役”的时候，越南人民军乘机肃清敌人散布在山萝地区的二千多名武装匪徒，使莱州的敌军完全暴露在越南人民军面前。为了挽救西北之危，纳瓦尔只好从正在吃紧的红河三角洲把四个营的兵力空运到越、寮边界的奠边府。可是已经无补于事了。在越南人民军和游击队的威逼下，法国侵略军不得不放弃西北重镇莱州，使奠边府又陷入孤立的地位。
    勒克莱克、塔西尼等的同样的遭遇正等待着纳瓦尔。
    武元甲总司令展望越南的战局。他引证胡志明主席的话说：“抗战一定取得胜利，但必须是长期、艰苦和自力更生的。”
    这是胡志明主席对全国人民的号召，也是越南人民军的战略方针。这些年来，越南人民军在军事上取得了巨大的胜利，越南人民军知道，法帝国主义是不甘心失败的，美帝国主义正加紧进行干涉，并继续扩大侵略战争。
    愈战愈强的越南人民军，正肩负着长期斗争的艰巨任务。但人人都充满胜利的信心。他们很清楚：侵略战争带给敌人不利的因素，敌人是无法消除的；相反的，人民的军队却具备着许多有利的因素。这些因素，在战争中不断增长，逐渐改变着抗战初期敌强我弱的形势，并且今后还将随着战争的发展而增长。
    武元甲总司令最后结束他的谈话说：“因为我们有着英雄的人民，有着一支人民的军队，有着全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持，在劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，我们的抗战一定胜利。”
