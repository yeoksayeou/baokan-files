    Further Develop the People's Film Industry

    The State Council of the Central People's Government has announced two decisions: one on strengthening film production and the other on establishing a film projection network and film industry. These two decisions will have a significant impact on the future development of China's people's film industry.

    Our films are an important tool for conducting patriotic and socialist education among the people, and at the same time, an important means of raising the people's cultural level. Our film work has made achievements in the past four years. We have produced many feature films and documentaries, and translated many films from the Soviet Union and other brother countries, which have been widely viewed and have had a great educational impact on the people. Some excellent domestic films have also been warmly welcomed abroad. The film projection network has developed rapidly and extensively, and millions of working people who have never seen a film before can now see them.

    However, as the State Council's decision points out, the quantity and quality of current film production still cannot meet the needs of the broad masses. The Chinese people are facing the great task of building our country into a socialist country, and this great task places even greater demands on our film industry. Our films should exert their unique effectiveness and enormous power to mobilize and organize the people to strive to complete the great historical task of our country.

    The important issue in film work at present is to increase the quantity of feature films and improve their quality. The state of our film production in the past four years has been unsatisfactory. Film studios have been partially shut down due to a lack of films to shoot, many directors and actors have long lost the opportunity for artistic performance, and the broad audience complains that there are too few new films. The main reason for the lack of feature films is the lack of film scripts that can be used. On the one hand, many of our writers are not familiar with this art form and lack experience in writing film scripts. Some writers have not paid enough attention to film script creation. On the other hand, the leading departments of film creation have not adopted correct and effective methods in the past to attract a large number of writers to actively participate in the creation of film scripts. This situation must be changed. Stalin once pointed out that film is "the most important and most popular art," and it has "enormous, invaluable power." The broad masses' enthusiastic love for films proves the correctness of this instruction. Our writers must not take an indifferent attitude towards such an important art form that is loved by the broad masses. They should regard the creation of excellent film scripts as their responsibility and strive to become familiar with this new work. In fact, if they do not meet the needs of the masses, then who will meet the needs of the masses? The film department should cooperate closely with the writers' association, expand and strengthen its contacts with writers, improve the methods of organizing script creation, organize their creation according to the specific conditions of each writer, and provide them with various assistance needed to complete their creation. The writers' works should be carefully studied, and if necessary, patiently helped to revise them. They should not be rejected arbitrarily and casually. The national and local writers' associations should include the organization of film script creation as an important task in their work agenda.

    Our films basically follow Comrade Mao Zedong's direction for literature and art. They reflect the life and struggle of the Chinese working people, show the noble spiritual qualities of the working people, and correctly explain the meaning of life to the people. This is completely different from the decadent bourgeois films. Some of our films have reached a high ideological and artistic level. However, despite this, there are still many serious shortcomings in our film creation, and it still lags far behind real life. Before us, in socialist transformation, life is undergoing drastic changes, and the struggle between newborn, progressive things and dying, backward things is prevalent in every corner. This provides our writers with infinitely rich creative material. However, our films cannot yet profoundly and richly reflect real life. The aspects touched upon by our film themes are obviously too narrow. A broad field of life still awaits our writers and filmmakers to explore and depict. For example, we do not yet have enough films showing the history of the Chinese people's revolutionary struggle and the heroic deeds of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, nor do we have enough films showing the achievements made by the new China in social reform and economic recovery and development in the past four years, nor do we have films showing the struggle to defend the border, nor do we have films depicting the life of the Youth League members and showing the awakening process of women. The life of young students seems to have become a forbidden area for literature and art, and there are almost no films depicting children or suitable for children to watch. The lagging of film art behind reality is also manifested in its failure to summarize life at a higher level and its inability to create typical images of advanced figures. They should be flesh and blood, with distinct personalities, rather than the embodiment of a certain concept. Only such characters can give people an unforgettable impression and become a force to encourage people to move forward. Therefore, to improve the quality of feature films, the first requirement is that our writers and filmmakers boldly expand their horizons, study the activities of the Chinese people in all aspects, reflect the boiling life and vivid face of our motherland in all aspects, expose the real contradictions of life, show the vigorous new forces in all aspects of life, and give those dying and backward things that hinder the progress of life a painful lash.

    To strengthen the work of feature films does not mean that other types of films can be ignored. Newsreels and science education films play an important role in promptly reflecting the country's political life and improving the people's cultural knowledge. According to Lenin, newsreels are "visualized political essays," and science and technology films are "visualized popular lectures." Lenin believed that these two types of films, plus artistic feature films, are the three indispensable forms of film production. Our science education films are still in their infancy, while newsreel work has more experience and has produced some excellent films, which have been successful both at home and abroad. Some newsreel photographers have worked hard deep in the front lines during the Liberation War and the struggle to resist U.S. aggression and aid Korea, and some of them have gloriously sacrificed themselves. These should be commended. However, there are also many shortcomings in the work of newsreels, the main one being that the production is too slow. Some documentaries reflecting major movements often cannot be made until long after the movement has passed, which greatly reduces the political role that newsreels should have as "visualized political essays." This shows that the comrades working on newsreels have not fully realized the characteristics of newsreels and the responsibility of their work. Newsreels should be brothers of newspapers. They should quickly and promptly report to the people various events and phenomena in reality, and show advanced figures in various movements and struggles. Therefore, in addition to shooting large-scale documentaries, full attention should be paid to the shooting of small documentaries. Local cinemas and projection teams should attach great importance to the screening and publicity work of newsreels. In this regard, the Soviet Union's experience is also worth learning from. On the fifth day after the fascist German invasion of the Soviet Union, special war zone newsreels appeared on screens across the Soviet Union. Within a few months of the start of the war, large and small documentaries on the defense of Moscow were produced. They also closely cooperated with the country's economic construction, creating a variety of documentaries, praising achievements in work, criticizing shortcomings in work, and screening these films promptly in front of the vast number of workers in the construction areas. This approach has played a significant role in improving work.

    In recent years, we have translated many films from the Soviet Union and other brother countries, which is a very meaningful work. These films not only help us to concretely understand the history of struggle and the people's lives of brother countries, but also give us a vivid communist and internationalist education. These films are warmly welcomed by our audience on the one hand, but on the other hand, because many viewers are not familiar with foreign history and customs, or because the content of the films is more complex, some viewers have difficulty in fully understanding the content of these films. This requires taking appropriate methods to make popular explanations of the translated films, and the film department should quickly and effectively solve this problem. At the same time, the quality of translated films should be improved to ensure that the translation is accurate and clear, fully conveying the content and style of the original work, and avoiding errors.

    In order to meet the growing cultural demands of the broad masses of workers and peasants, it is necessary to develop the film projection industry in a planned way and gradually establish a film projection network throughout the country. At present, there are few film projection units, and their distribution is uneven. Many people in many places still cannot see or cannot easily see movies. The development policy of our projection industry is to first face the industrial and mining areas, and then face the rural areas. In addition to establishing cinemas in some industrial and mining areas, the main focus for the vast rural areas is to develop mobile projection teams. At present, there are more than 2,000 mobile projection teams across the country, which regularly tour and show movies in factories, rural areas, and troops. Their work is very hard, and they are often on the road, so they cannot study well. In addition, the leading organs do not give them enough help and care. Therefore, some projectionists have not been able to improve politically and technically for a long time, so that they cannot complete their tasks well. Cultural propaganda departments at all levels should attach importance to projection work and strengthen the leadership of projection work. The Film Bureau of the Central Ministry of Culture and cultural departments at all levels should establish and improve dedicated management institutions for the projection network, to manage the projection work nationwide and improve the projection quality of cinemas and projection teams. At the same time, gradually fix the projection areas of mobile projection teams, and according to the specific situation, transfer the projection teams to be directly led by the cultural authorities of the special zone and county, strengthen the regular political and ideological education of the projection teams, so that the projectionists can continuously improve their political and ideological level, so that they can perform their work with a higher sense of responsibility and greater enthusiasm, and become excellent propagandists among the masses.

    The broad masses of people demand that our film workers produce more excellent films. In order to complete this task, we must first rely on the efforts of the film workers themselves, but also need strong help from all relevant parties. The Party, the government, and the people of the whole country are very concerned about the film industry. Under the leadership of the Party and the government, the supervision of the people, and the help of all parties, our film industry will be able to overcome its shortcomings and difficulties in its work, grow rapidly, and play its huge combat power in the struggle to build our great motherland.

### 进一步发展人民电影事业

    进一步发展人民电影事业
    中央人民政府政务院公布了关于加强电影制片工作和关于建立电影放映网与电影工业的两个决定。这两个决定对于今后我国人民电影事业的发展将有极大的作用。
    我们的电影是向人民进行爱国主义和社会主义教育的重要工具，同时又是提高人民文化水平的重要手段。四年来，我们的电影工作是有成绩的。我们制出了不少故事片和纪录片，并且翻译了苏联和其他兄弟国家的许多影片，它们获得了广大的观众，对人民发生了巨大的教育作用。一些优秀的国产影片，在国外也受到热烈的欢迎。放映网的事业有迅速而广泛的发展，成千百万从来没有看过电影的劳动人民，现在也能看到电影了。
    但是，正如政务院的决定所指出的，目前电影出品的数量和质量都还不能满足广大群众的需要。我国人民正面临着把我国建设成为社会主义国家的伟大任务，这个伟大的任务更向我们的电影事业提出了重大的要求。我们的电影应该发挥它的特有效能和巨大力量来动员和组织人民为完成我国的伟大历史任务而奋斗。
    目前电影工作中的重要问题，是增加故事片的数量并提高其质量。四年来，我们影片生产的状况是不能令人满意的。电影制片厂曾因没有影片可拍而陷于部分停工状况，不少导演演员曾长期地失去了艺术表演的机会，而广大观众则埋怨新片太少。故事片缺少的主要原因，是缺乏可以采用的电影剧本，这一方面是由于我们的许多作家还不熟悉这一种艺术形式，还缺乏编写电影剧本的经验，有些作家对于电影剧本创作还没有予以足够的重视；另一方面是由于电影创作的领导部门过去没有采取正确的和有效的方法来吸引大量的作家积极参加电影剧本的创作。这种状况是必须改变的。斯大林曾经指出：电影是“最重要的、最大众化的艺术”，它具有“巨大的、无法估价的力量”。广大群众对于电影的热烈爱好，证明了这个指示的正确。我们的作家决不能够对于这样重要的为广大群众所喜爱的艺术事业采取漠不关心的态度，他们应该把创作优秀的电影剧本看作自己的责任，而努力去熟悉这个新的工作。事实上，如果他们不来满足群众的要求，那么依靠谁来满足群众的要求呢？电影部门应该和作家协会密切合作，扩大和加强与作家的联系，改善组织剧本创作的方法，根据各个作家的具体条件来组织他们的创作，并且给予他们为完成创作所需要的各种帮助。对于作家的作品，应该审慎地加以研究，必要时耐心地帮助他们进行修改，不应该轻率地任意否定。全国的和各地的作家协会，都应该把组织电影剧本的创作，作为一个重要的任务列入自己的工作日程。
    我们的电影基本上是遵循着毛泽东同志的文艺方向的，它反映了我国劳动人民的生活和斗争，表现了劳动人民高尚的精神品质，向人民正确地阐释了生活的意义，这是和教人堕落的资产阶级的电影截然不同的，我们的有些影片并已达到了较高的思想和艺术水平。但是，尽管如此，我们的电影创作还存在着不少严重的缺点，它还远远地落在现实生活的后面。在我们面前，在社会主义改造当中，生活正在发生着剧烈的变化，新生的前进的事物和垂死的落后的事物的斗争，是普遍于每个角落的。这就提供了我们的作家以无限丰富的创作的素材。但是，我们的电影尚不能深刻丰富地反映现实生活，我们的电影题材所接触的方面显然是太狭小了，广阔的生活领域还等待着我们的作家和电影工作者去探索和描绘。比如，我们还没有足够地表现中国人民革命斗争历史和抗美援朝英雄事迹的影片，还没有足够地反映新中国四年来在社会改革及经济恢复和发展方面所获得的成就的影片，还没有表现保卫边疆的斗争的影片，还没有描写青年团员的生活和表现妇女的觉悟历程的影片，青年学生的生活领域似乎成了文学艺术的禁地，描写少年儿童或适合于少年儿童观看的影片，也几乎没有。电影艺术落后于现实，还表现在没有能更高度地概括生活，很少能够塑造出先进人物的典型形象，他们应该是有血有肉的，性格鲜明的，而不是某一概念的化身。只有这样的人物才能给人以难忘的印象，成为鼓舞人们前进的力量。因此，提高故事片的质量，首先就要求我们的作家和电影工作者勇敢地扩大自己的视野，研究我国人民各方面的活动，从各方面来反映我们祖国的沸腾的生活和生动的面貌；揭露生活的真实矛盾，表现各方面生活中蓬勃的新生力量，并给那些阻碍生活前进的垂死的落后的东西以痛烈的鞭笞。
    要加强故事片的工作，并不是说可以忽视其他的片种。新闻纪录片和科学教育片在及时地反映国家的政治生活和提高人民的文化知识方面是有重要的作用的。按照列宁的说法，新闻纪录片是“形象化的政论”，而科学技术片是“形象化的通俗演讲”，列宁认为这两个片种加上艺术故事片是电影生产不可缺一的三种形式。我们的科学教育片，目前还在草创时期，新闻纪录片的工作则有了较多的经验，也产生了一些优秀的片子，在国内国外都获得了成功。一些新闻纪录片的摄影人员曾在解放战争和抗美援朝的斗争中深入前线去艰苦地工作，其中有的光荣牺牲。这些是应该加以表扬的。但在新闻纪录片的工作中也存在着不少缺点，其中主要的是出品太慢，一些反映重大运动的纪录片往往在运动过去很久以后还不能制成，这就大大减少了作为“形象化的政论”的新闻纪录片所应有的政治作用。这表现了新闻纪录片的工作同志还没有充分地认识新闻纪录片的特性和自己的工作的责任。新闻纪录片应该是报纸的兄弟，它应该迅速地及时地向人民报道现实中的各种事件和现象，表现各种运动和斗争中的先进人物。因此，除了摄制大型的纪录片以外，应该充分地重视小型纪录片的摄制。各地电影院和放映队应该十分重视新闻纪录片的放映和宣传工作。在这方面，苏联的经验也是值得我们学习的。在法西斯德国侵入苏联后的第五天，苏联各地的银幕上就出现了战地新闻特辑，战争开始后几个月就制出了以保卫莫斯科为内容的大型和小型纪录片。他们又密切地配合国家的经济建设，创造了多种多样的纪录片，表扬工作中的成绩，批评工作中的缺点，并且把这些片子及时地在建设区的广大工人面前放映出来。这种作法对工作的改进起了很大的作用。
    几年来，我们翻译了苏联及其他兄弟国家的许多影片，这是一件极有意义的工作。这些影片不但帮助我们具体地了解兄弟国家的斗争历史和人民生活，并且给了我们以生动的共产主义的和国际主义的教育。这些影片一方面受到我国观众的热烈欢迎，但另一方面，由于许多观众不熟悉外国的历史和生活习惯，或者由于影片的内容比较复杂，又使部分观众在充分理解这些影片的内容上发生困难。这就需要采取适当的方法对翻译片进行通俗的解释，电影部门应该迅速地有效地解决这个问题。同时，应该提高翻译片的质量，做到译语的准确、明白，充分传达出原作的内容和风格，避免错误。
    为了满足广大工农群众日益增长的文化要求，必须有计划地发展电影放映事业，逐渐在全国建立电影放映网。目前电影放映单位尚少，且分布又不平衡，很多地方人民还看不到或不易看到电影。我们的放映事业的发展方针，是首先面向工矿地区，然后面向农村。除了在一些工矿区建立电影院以外，对广大农村主要是发展流动放映队。目前全国已经有二千多个流动放映队，经常在工厂、农村和部队中巡回放映。他们的工作是很辛苦的，并且经常在路上奔波，不能很好地进行学习，加以领导机关对他们帮助和照顾不够，因此，有些放映人员在政治上和业务技术上都长期得不到提高，以致不能很好地完成自己的任务。各级文化宣传部门应重视放映工作，加强对放映工作的领导。中央文化部电影局和各级文化部门应该建立和健全专责的放映网管理机构，统管全国的放映工作，提高电影院和放映队的放映质量。同时，逐步固定流动放映队的放映地区，根据具体情况，将放映队分别交由专区和县的文化主管部门直接领导，加强对于放映队的经常的政治思想教育，使放映员能够不断地提高自己的政治思想水平，从而使他们能够用更高的责任心和更大的热情来执行自己的工作，并且成为在群众中的优秀的宣传员。
    广大人民要求我们的电影工作者制作出更多的优秀的影片，为了完成这个任务，首先依靠电影工作者自身的努力，同时也需要各个有关方面给以有力的帮助。党、政府和全国人民都是十分关心电影事业的，在党和政府的领导、人民的监督和各方面的帮助下，我们的电影事业一定能够克服自己的缺点和工作中的困难，迅速地成长起来，在建设我们的伟大祖国的斗争中，发挥它的巨大的战斗力量。
