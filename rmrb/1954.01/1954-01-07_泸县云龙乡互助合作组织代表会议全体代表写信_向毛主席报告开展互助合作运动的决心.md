Luzhou County Yunlong Township Mutual Aid Cooperation Organization Representatives Meeting All Representatives Write a Letter to Chairman Mao Reporting the Determination to Develop the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement

Respected Chairman Mao:

Recently, after studying the general line of the state during the transition period, we have more clearly recognized the grand goal of socialism and a truly happy life. After liberation, like farmers across the country, under the leadership of the Communist Party and you, we were allocated land and houses, developed mutual aid and cooperation, and achieved three consecutive years of bumper harvests. Our lives have greatly improved. However, some of our farmers feel somewhat satisfied with their current lives, and a few farmers have begun to engage in usury, buying green crops in empty barns, and doing business, resulting in spontaneous capitalist tendencies. After studying the state's general line for the transition period, our eyes have become much brighter, and our minds have broadened. We recognize that farmers cannot take the capitalist road; only by taking the bright road of socialism can we live a happy life of common prosperity. Therefore, all the farmers in our township are actively responding to the government's call to sell surplus grain to the state to support the country's industrial construction. Among the 1,022 households in the township, more than 600 surplus grain households sold more than 1.1 million jin of yellow grain to the state. Of the proceeds from the grain sales, 34 percent was used to buy back means of production such as oxen, plows, pigs, and oil cakes; 59 percent was deposited in the People's Bank to prepare for spring production funds; and the remaining 7 percent was used to buy daily necessities such as oil, salt, and cloth to appropriately improve our lives.

Chairman Mao: Through this study, we realize that if farmers want to move towards socialism, they must do a good job in agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation, supply and marketing cooperation, and credit cooperation. The 160 representatives of mutual aid team leaders, supply and marketing cooperative representatives, and credit cooperative preparatory representatives from our township held a three-day meeting from December 9th to 11th to review our past work and set future goals. The township currently has 101 mutual aid teams (including six permanent mutual aid teams), with participating households accounting for 76 percent of the township's farm households and 73 percent of the agricultural population. In the future, we are determined to gradually organize more farmers in accordance with the policy of "active leadership and steady progress." Temporary seasonal mutual aid teams should strive to be upgraded to permanent mutual aid teams, and permanent mutual aid teams should create conditions to strive to establish agricultural production cooperatives. The Wen Shaozhang Mutual Aid Team is preparing to unite with three mutual aid teams to establish an agricultural production cooperative. Currently, 1,424 people in the township participate in the supply and marketing cooperative. A detailed account was calculated at this meeting: Over the past two years, the district supply and marketing cooperative has managed 39.8 billion yuan of production and living materials for cooperative members in the district, reducing the intermediate exploitation of cooperative members by 2 billion yuan. Everyone is determined to further mobilize the masses to participate in the supply and marketing cooperative. In addition, over the past two years, the government has successively lent us 65 million yuan for seeds, cattle, water conservancy, fertilizers, and food rations, helping farmers with difficulties in production and life to solve many problems. For example, farmer Li Hairong was short of food rations during the green and yellow period this year and planned to sell five dou of green seedlings for 50,000 yuan. However, the government later lent him 50,000 yuan, and he only used three dou of yellow grain to pay off the loan after the autumn harvest. We know that the country is carrying out planned construction and needs a lot of funds, and our economic situation is improving day by day. We should not simply rely on the state bank but should also use our own strength to overcome most of our difficulties. Therefore, we decided to establish a credit cooperative and use the method of accumulating small amounts to help each other solve everyone's difficulties. The township initially plans to develop 2,000 shares, each worth 30,000 yuan, and farmers are enthusiastically investing.

Chairman Mao: Entrusted by the people of the township, we must organize the farmers of the township to study the general line, enhance their understanding of socialism, and resolutely do a good job in the three tasks of agricultural mutual aid and cooperation, supply and marketing cooperation, and credit cooperation, and advance along the socialist road under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government!

    泸县云龙乡互助合作组织代表会议全体代表写信
    向毛主席报告开展互助合作运动的决心敬爱的毛主席：
    最近学习了国家在过渡时期的总路线，我们更加明确地认识了社会主义的远大目标和真正幸福的生活。解放后，我们和全国农民一样，在共产党和您的领导下，分得了土地、房屋，发展了互助合作，获得了连续三年的丰收。我们的生活大大地改善了。可是，我们有些农民对于现在的生活有点感到满足了，并且还有少数农民开始放高利贷、买青苗空仓、经商，产生自发的资本主义的倾向。学习了国家过渡时期的总路线后，我们眼睛明朗多了，胸襟开阔了。我们认识了农民不能走资本主义的道路，只有走社会主义的光明大道才能使我们过大家富裕的幸福生活。因此，我们全乡农民都积极响应政府号召，把余粮卖给国家，支援祖国工业建设。全乡一千零二十二户中，六百多户余粮户共卖给国家黄谷一百一十多万斤。卖粮所得款项，百分之三十四买回了耕牛、犁头、猪、油饼等生产资料；百分之五十九存入人民银行，准备春季生产资金；其余百分之七用来买油、盐、布匹等生活资料，适当地改善了我们的生活。
    毛主席：通过这一次学习，我们认识到：农民要走向社会主义，必须要把农业生产互助合作、供销合作和信用合作几项工作搞好。我们全乡的互助组长代表、供销合作社代表和信用合作筹备代表一百六十人在十二月九日至十一日开了三天会议，检查了我们过去的工作，并定出了今后的奋斗的目标。全乡现有一百零一个互助组
  （其中有六个常年互助组），参加的户数占全乡农户的百分之七十六，占农业人口的百分之七十三。今后我们决心根据“积极领导，稳步前进”的方针，逐步把更多的农民组织起来，临时季节性互助组要争取提高为常年互助组，常年互助组要创造条件争取建立农业生产合作社。温绍章互助组已准备联合三个互助组建立一个农业生产合作社。全乡现在参加供销合作社的有一千四百二十四人。这次会上算了细账，区供销合作社两年来为全区社员经营了三百九十八亿元的生产和生活资料，使社员少受二十亿元的中间剥削。大家都决心进一步发动群众参加供销合作社。还有，两年来政府先后贷给我们种子、耕牛、水利、肥料和口粮的款项达六千五百多万元，帮助生产和生活上有困难的农民解决了很多困难。如农民李海荣今年青黄不接时缺口粮，准备卖五斗青苗得五万元，但后来政府贷给他五万元，秋收后只用了三斗黄谷即付清了贷款。我们知道国家正在进行计划建设，需要的资金很多，而我们的经济情况日益上升，不应单纯依靠国家银行，也该用自己的力量克服自己的大部分困难。因此我们决定成立信用合作社，用聚少成多，互相帮助的办法解决大家困难。全乡初步计划发展二千股，每股三万元，农民们正踊跃入股。
    毛主席：我们受着全乡人民的委托，回去后一定要组织全乡农民学习总路线，提高对社会主义的认识，坚决把农业互助合作、供销合作和信用合作三件工作搞好，在共产党和人民政府的领导下，沿着社会主义的道路前进！
