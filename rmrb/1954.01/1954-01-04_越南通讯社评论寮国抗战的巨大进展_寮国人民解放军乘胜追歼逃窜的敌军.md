    Vietnam News Agency Comments on the Great Progress of the Lao Resistance Against France
    Lao People's Liberation Army Pursues and Annihilates Fleeing Enemy Troops
    [Xinhua News Agency, 3rd] Vietnam News Agency military commentator Zheng Yi published a commentary on the 2nd entitled "The Victory of Thakhek Marks Great Progress in the Lao Resistance Against France."
    The commentary said: In the spring of 1953, Phongsaly Province was liberated, and the Lao people's resistance base was established in northern Laos, connected to the Vietnamese liberated area.
    In the winter of 1953, Khammouane Province was also liberated. The Lao military and civilians achieved a new great victory, expanding the people's resistance base in central Laos, creating favorable conditions for advancing the Lao people's resistance against France.
    The newly liberated capital of Khammouane Province, Thakhek, is an important strategic area located on Highway 13, a major artery connecting Vientiane, Luang Prabang, and Saigon in South Vietnam. Khammouane Province is bordered by the Vietnamese provinces of Nghe An, Ha Tinh, and Quang Binh to the east, and Thailand across the Mekong River to the west. Khammouane Province has a population of about 400,000, and the areas along the Mekong River and the Hinboun River have vast and rich rice paddies, as well as abundant forest products and important tin mines in areas such as Phong Tiou and Ban Nao.
    The commentary said that in 1945, inspired by the victory of the August Revolution in Vietnam, residents of five cities in Laos were the first to rise up and seize power from the Japanese fascists, and Thakhek was one of those cities. In 1946, the French colonialists made a comeback. But since then, the people of Khammouane Province have been engaged in unremitting struggle and have established guerrilla areas near Thakhek, Napo and other places.
    The commentary pointed out: The victory of Thakhek marks a great progress in the patriotic war of the Lao military and civilians against the imperialist aggressors. Because this victory has enabled the Lao people to turn Khammouane Province into a strong people's resistance base echoing Phongsaly Province in the north and the Bolaven Plateau in the south.
    The commentary concluded: While the Vietnamese People's Army liberated Lai Chau and annihilated a large number of enemy troops in the Red River Delta, the significant achievements of the Lao People's Liberation Army in Khammouane Province forced Navarre to disperse his forces to cope with this passive situation. The French military headquarters hurriedly dispatched many mobile units from the Red River Delta to Savannakhet south of Thakhek, attempting to reopen strategically valuable Highway 13. However, the Lao military and civilians are determined to smash all enemy conspiracies, and the imperialist aggressors will surely suffer greater defeats.

    [Xinhua News Agency, 3rd] According to the Vietnam News Agency Laos dispatch on the 2nd: The Lao People's Liberation Army has continued to win victories in the battle to pursue and annihilate enemy troops.
    A communique issued on the 2nd stated that at 6:00 a.m. on December 29, 1953, the Lao People's Liberation Army searched for the remnants of the enemy hiding in the jungle south of Thakhek. Thirty-six enemy troops belonging to the 4th company of the 27th French-African battalion immediately came out of hiding and surrendered, including one captain, one lieutenant, and ten sergeants. At the same time, the Lao People's Liberation Army continued to pursue the fleeing enemy in the Le Sao area, 100 kilometers north of Thakhek. A unit of the Lao People's Liberation Army entering the Le Sao area seized six tons of enemy military supplies, three generators, and destroyed eighty trucks.

    越南通讯社评论寮国抗战的巨大进展
    寮国人民解放军乘胜追歼逃窜的敌军
    【新华社三日讯】越南通讯社军事评论员政义在二日以“他曲的胜利标志着寮国抗战的巨大进展”为题发表评论。
    评论说：一九五三年春季，桑怒省解放了，寮国人民的抗战基地在寮国北部建立起来，并和越南解放区连成一片。
    一九五三年冬季，甘蒙省也解放了。寮国军民取得了新的巨大的胜利，扩大了寮国中部的人民抗战基地，为推进寮国人民的抗战创造了有利的条件。
    新解放的甘蒙省省会他曲是位于连接万象、琅勃刺邦和南越的西贡的第十三号公路这条大动脉上的一个重要战略地区。甘蒙省东邻中越的义安、河静和广平等省，西以湄公河为界与泰国相邻；甘蒙省拥有四十万左右的人口，沿湄公河和宾非河的地区有广大而富庶的稻田，还拥有丰富的森林产品和逢蒂乌、波年等地的重要锡矿。
    评论说，一九四五年，在越南八月革命胜利的鼓舞下，寮国有五个城市的居民首先起来从日本法西斯手中夺取了政权，他曲就是其中的一个城市。一九四六年，法国殖民者卷土重来。但是从那时起，甘蒙省人民一直在坚持不懈地进行着斗争，并在他曲、那爆等地附近建立了游击区。
    评论指出：他曲的胜利标志着寮国军民在反对帝国主义侵略者的爱国战争中的巨大进展。因为这一胜利已使寮国人民可以把甘蒙省变成一个与北部的桑怒省和南部波罗芬高原相呼应的强大的人民抗战基地。
    评论最后说：在越南人民军解放莱州并在红河三角洲歼灭大批敌人有生力量的同时，寮国人民解放军在甘蒙省所取得的重大战绩使纳瓦尔不得不分散他的兵力来应付这种被动的局势。法军总司令部急忙从红河三角洲派了许多机动部队到他曲以南的沙湾拿吉，企图重新打通这条具有战略价值的第十三号公路。但是，寮国军民决心粉碎敌人的一切阴谋，帝国主义侵略者一定要遭到更大的失败。
    【新华社三日讯】据越南通讯社寮国二日讯：寮国人民解放军在追歼敌军的战斗中，续获胜利。
    二日发表的公报说，一九五三年十二月二十九日上午六时，寮国人民解放军向藏匿在他曲以南丛林中的残敌进行搜索，当即有属于第二十七欧非营第四连的三十六名敌军走出隐蔽处所投降，其中有上尉、中尉军官各一名和上士十名。同时，寮国人民解放军继续在他曲以北一百公里的勒骚地区追击狼狈逃窜的敌军。进入勒骚地区的寮国人民解放军的一支部队缴获敌军军火六吨、发电机三部，击毁卡车八十辆。
