The people of all circles in Tianjin, demonstrating a great spirit of loving the motherland, actively subscribe to the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds.

The workers and staff of factories and enterprises, cadres of institutions, shop assistants, and workers in cultural, educational, and medical fields in Tianjin have victoriously concluded the public bond subscription work on the 20th. The number of public bonds they subscribed to greatly exceeded the expected number. The number of public bonds subscribed to by workers and staff of factories and enterprises and shop assistants exceeded the expected number by more than 80%; the number of public bonds subscribed to by cadres of institutions throughout the city exceeded the expected number by 1.45 times; and the number of public bonds subscribed to by workers in cultural, educational, and medical fields exceeded the expected number by nearly four times.

The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, the Municipal People's Government, and their affiliated institutions exceeded the expected number by one and a half times within two or three days after the start of the subscription. The staff of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, after listening to the mobilization report by the responsible comrades on the afternoon of the 6th, exceeded the expected number by more than two times by noon on the 8th. The cadres all regarded this action as their glorious responsibility to support the country's socialist construction. Guan Yusu, a cadre of the Foreign Affairs Office of the Tianjin Municipal People's Government, took out 10.03 million yuan of his royalties earned from years of hard work in translation to subscribe to public bonds. Many cadres of the Tianjin State-owned Foreign Trade System who were working outside sent letters to the institutions after hearing the news of Tianjin's public bond subscription, entrusting others to purchase them on their behalf.

The broad masses of workers and shop assistants in factories and enterprises in Tianjin have improved their class consciousness after studying the general line, and played an exemplary leading role in this public bond subscription. The workers of the local state-owned North China Oxygen Plant completed the subscription on the same day they started promoting public bond subscription on the 8th of this month, and overfulfilled the pre-determined subscription number by two and a half times. Ma Shulan, a female worker at the State-owned Fourth Cotton Textile Factory, was about to get married, but after the upsurge of public bond subscription was set off, she immediately saved 1 million yuan from the money she had prepared for the wedding to buy public bonds. She said, "It doesn't matter if the personal wedding ceremony is simpler, national construction is important." Liu Shuqing, a female cook at the privately-owned Far East Automobile Material Store, suffered a lot before liberation, and her son was taken away by the Kuomintang to serve as a soldier. After liberation, her son returned, and the government also helped her son find a job. Her family's life had a surplus. This time, she bought public bonds with 1 million yuan she had saved since liberation. Li Guorui, a worker of the Tianjin Railway Transportation Bureau's Locomotive Depot who went to Korea, heard about the issuance of public bonds in the motherland while in Korea and wrote to his family, asking his mother to take out her bank savings to buy public bonds. Many workers in the train section of the Railway Bureau also proposed to ensure safe transportation during the Spring Festival after purchasing public bonds.

The broad masses of workers in cultural, educational, and medical fields also demonstrated a high degree of patriotism in subscribing to public bonds. Faculty and staff of Tianjin University subscribed to more than 545 million yuan, exceeding the expected number by four times; medical workers throughout the city subscribed to more than 3.989 billion yuan. Lu Tizhang, attending physician of internal medicine at the Municipal General Hospital, participated in the International Medical and Health Service Team of the China People's Anti-American Aggression and Aid Korea General Association and has been away from the motherland for a year. When the news of the issuance of national economic construction bonds reached the Korean front, he immediately wrote back to subscribe to 5 million yuan of public bonds.

Nearly 60 industries in the private industrial and commercial circles in Tianjin, such as cotton spinning, wool and linen textiles, rubber, knitting, and chemical dyes, have successively overfulfilled the expected subscription number. At present, various industries that have completed or are close to completing the subscription number are mobilizing industrial and commercial households to fill out subscription forms and mobilizing them to pay as soon as possible. However, more than half of the industries have not yet completed the expected subscription number, which has affected the balanced progress of public bond subscription in the city's industrial and commercial circles.

    天津市各界人民积极认购公债
    天津市各界人民，表现了热爱祖国的伟大精神，积极认购一九五四年国家经济建设公债。
    天津市工厂企业职工、机关干部、店员及文教医务工作者，已在二十日胜利结束公债认购工作。他们认购公债的数字大大超过了预计数字。工厂企业职工、店员认购数字超过预计数字百分之八十以上；全市机关干部认购数字，超过预计数字一点四五倍；文教医务工作者认购数字，超过预计数字近四倍。
    中共天津市委会、市人民政府及所属机关，在开始认购后的两三天内，认购数字就超过了预计数字的一倍半。市公安局的工作人员，在六日下午听了负责同志的动员报告后，到八日中午，认购数字超过预计数字的两倍以上。干部们都把这一行动看成是自己支援国家进行社会主义建设的光荣责任。天津市人民政府外事处干部关予素，拿出自己多年辛勤从事翻译工作所得的一部分稿费一千零三十万元，认购了公债。天津市国营对外贸易系统的许多在外工作的干部，听到天津市认购公债的消息后，都纷纷给机关写信，委托别人代购。
    天津市各工厂企业的广大职工和店员，经过学习总路线，阶级觉悟提高，在这次认购公债中起了模范带头作用。地方国营华北氧气厂职工，在本月八日开始宣传认购公债的当天，就认购完毕，并超额完成预定认购数字的两倍半。国营第四棉纺织厂女工马淑兰，就要结婚了，但在认购公债的热潮掀起后，她立即把准备结婚用的钱节余出一百万元买了公债。她说：“个人结婚仪式简单点没有关系，国家建设要紧。”私营远东汽车材料行女炊事员刘淑卿，解放前受尽了苦，儿子被国民党抓去当兵。解放后儿子回来了，政府还帮助她儿子找到职业，家里生活有了敷余，这次她把解放后积蓄的一百万元买了公债。天津铁路运输分局机务段赴朝工人李国瑞，在朝鲜听到祖国发行公债，就给家里写信，要他母亲把银行存款拿出来买公债。铁路局列车段许多工人购买公债后还提出保证做好春节安全运输。
    广大文教医务工作者，在认购公债中也表现了高度的爱国主义精神。天津大学教职员工，就认购了五亿四千五百余万元，超过预计数字四倍；全市医务工作者，认购了三十九亿八千九百余万元。市立总医院内科主治医师卢倜章参加中国人民抗美援朝总会卫生工作委员会国际医防服务队工作，离开祖国已有一年。当发行国家经济建设公债的消息传到朝鲜前线后，他立即写信回来认购公债五百万元。
    天津市私营工商业界已有棉纺、毛麻纺织、橡胶、针织、化学染料等近六十个行业，先后超额完成预计认购数字。目前，认购已完成和接近认购数字的各业，正发动工商户填写认购书，并动员早日缴款。但目前仍有半数以上的行业，尚未完成预计认购数字，影响了全市工商界认购公债的均衡进展。
