The People's Bank began offering preferential treatment for fixed-term, fixed-amount savings for grain sellers in some areas last December. Within a month, it absorbed over 111 billion yuan in farmers' savings, bringing the total rural savings nationwide to over 203 billion yuan. Since the beginning of this year, preferential savings for grain sales are rapidly developing in various regions, and the total savings will see even greater increases.

What are the benefits for farmers who actively participate in saving and depositing money?

Depositing money in the bank is much more worthwhile than storing grain at home. The People's Bank, to give preferential treatment to farmers selling grain, has stipulated particularly favorable interest rates: 1.5% monthly interest for deposits up to three months, and 2% for deposits from four to six months. Storing grain at home, on the other hand, does not increase its value and incurs more losses. Zhao Yusen and his son from Tantou Township, Licheng, Shandong, calculated that storing 1,000 jin of grain at home for half a year would result in a loss of 30 jin due to wind damage and insect infestation, not counting what rats eat. If they deposited 1 million yuan in the bank, they would earn 120,000 yuan in interest in half a year, equivalent to an increase of 160 jin of grain, enough to buy 70 or 80 jin of fertilizer and 40 chi of white cloth. Especially now that the state controls grain and grain prices are stable, storing grain is even less profitable than depositing money.

Depositing money in the bank, rather than keeping it at home, is more conducive to saving and planning production and life. As the saying goes, "Money in hand, food in mouth." Money tends to be easily spent when it's readily available. Hou, an old woman from Yaokule Village, Heilongjiang Province, said, "In the past, I was afraid of selling all the grain at once because my old man likes to drink. He'd spend 3,000 yuan today and 5,000 yuan tomorrow, and then we'd be strapped for cash when we needed it. Now, I sell several dan of grain to the state at once and deposit the remaining money." Li Dianqi from the same village plans to buy a horse in the spring and has deposited the money in the bank, which ensures that he won't spend it carelessly and will also earn hundreds of thousands of yuan in interest. Zhao Jinhai from the same village received 2 million yuan after selling grain and plans to build a house, but construction cannot begin until March, and the cooperative does not have lumber available right now. He deposited all the remaining money in the bank because money kept on hand is easily spent.

Farmers actively saving and depositing money can also stabilize the rural market, allowing the state to more systematically supply the necessary materials to rural areas.

Farmers' active participation in savings can also help the state accumulate capital to accelerate national construction, and the development of national construction undertakings is beneficial to the long-term interests of farmers. Some people say that their deposits are small, only 100,000 or 200,000 yuan, and they withdraw it again in a few months, which is not useful to the state. This is incorrect. As the saying goes, "Many a little makes a mickle." Our country has a large population, and everyone's savings, your withdrawals and his deposits, mean that the total amount of savings in the bank remains considerable. Currently, thanks to the enthusiastic savings of workers, farmers, urban residents, and people of other social strata, the total national savings have exceeded 12 trillion yuan, which can enable the state to do many things for the people.

Although preferential savings for grain sales have many benefits for farmers, as mentioned above, some farmers still have some unnecessary concerns about participating in savings.

Some people doubt that the bank will offer generous interest rates and believe that keeping money in their pockets is safer. This doubt can be eliminated by comparing facts and understanding the reasoning. The People's Government works for the people. Over the past few years, it has helped farmers reduce rent and return deposits, carried out land reform, built farmland irrigation and water conservancy projects, and developed agricultural production. Everything it has said, it has done. Under the leadership of the People's Government, the People's Bank has been issuing agricultural loans in rural areas for several years, with interest rates as low as 1% (some loans are only 0.75%), truly serving farmers without regard for profit or loss. The purpose of rural savings is also to serve farmers. In areas where rural savings were established early, farmers have already learned the benefits of saving from their own experience. For example, farmers in Meixian, Guangdong, saved one yuan for every yuan they earned, and they saved enough to buy more than 130 head of cattle. Fishermen in Zhapei Port, Yangjiang County, Guangdong, used to spend lavishly after selling the extra fish they caught. After bank staff promoted savings and provided assistance, they changed their habits. Starting in the winter of the year before last, they deposited some money every time they returned from the sea. By the peak production season last July, they had purchased 167 boats for deep-sea and shallow-sea fishing, and their fish catch was more than 30% higher than the year before last. They call the People's Bank their "treasury."

Some people fear that prices will rise, the value of money will decrease, and savings will be unprofitable. Due to the development of national industrial and agricultural production, balanced fiscal revenue and expenditure, normal supply of materials, and state-owned companies and cooperatives controlling sufficient material reserves and having a full grasp of the grain supply market after purchasing grain, prices are certain to continue to be stable, and the value of money will not decrease. Even if a supply-demand imbalance occurs in certain regions or for a particular type of material, state-owned stores and cooperatives have the full capacity to transfer materials to meet the needs of farmers and stabilize the market. Therefore, this concern is unnecessary.

Some farmers say, "It's too much trouble to sell grain, deposit the money in the bank." In this regard, the bank has taken or is taking many measures to facilitate farmers as much as possible. In addition to having business offices in many market towns, the bank has also entrusted supply and marketing cooperatives and credit cooperatives to handle savings. The People's Bank business office in Datuan District, Nanhui, Jiangsu, absorbed farmers' savings in the winter before last. During the spring plowing and production last year, it took the initiative to send people to the countryside to cash out savings, and the farmers believed that "the bank brings money to the village to help us with production. Only the people's own bank can do this." Although not every business office can send money to the countryside, it is certain that they will make it as convenient as possible for farmers to deposit and withdraw money.

In short, saving is only beneficial and not harmful to farmers. Wo Haihai, a farmer in Suihan Village, Xindeng County, Zhejiang, sold 1,900 jin of grain and received 1.32 million yuan. He immediately deposited 1.2 million yuan, saying, "There are three major benefits to selling surplus grain and depositing money in the bank that is not needed for the time being. First, it helps national industrial construction; second, the bank turns around and lends the deposited money to help farmers in need; third, the money won't be spent, and there will be interest. It will be most timely to withdraw it next year to buy fertilizer." Farmers' grain sales and savings are an act of patriotism, supporting national industrial construction, and also a way to better plan their own production and life. As long as we combine this with the general line propaganda and explain this to the farmers clearly, they will enthusiastically sell grain and save money.

    节约储蓄对农民的好处
    杨培新
    去年十二月人民银行在部分地区开始举办优待售粮定期定额储蓄后，一个月内就吸收农民储蓄一万一千一百余亿元，使全国农村储蓄总额达到二万零三百余亿元的数字。今年以来，优待售粮储蓄正在各地迅速开展，储蓄总额将有更大的增加。
      农民积极参加节约储蓄，对农民说来有些什么好处呢？
    在银行存款比在家里存粮要合算得多。人民银行为优待售粮农民，规定了特别优厚的利率，存款在三个月以下月息一分五厘，存款在四个月至六个月的二分。而在家里存粮，不能增值，消耗还多。山东历城滩头乡赵玉森父子算了一次账，存一千斤粮食，半年内风耗、虫蛀，不算老鼠吃，就得少三十斤；如果存一百万元在银行，半年内得利息十二万元，等于增加一百六十斤粮食，可以买七、八十斤肥田粉，四十尺白布。特别是国家掌握粮食后，粮食价格稳定，存粮更不如存款有利。
    在银行存款，比在家里存钱，更有利于节约和安排生产、生活。俗话说：“钱到手，饭到口”，钱放在手头总是容易花掉的。黑龙江省腰库勒村侯老太太说：“过去我怕一下子把粮食卖了。因为我们老头子好喝酒，今天三千元，明天五千元，就花光了，一时想用就转不过手来。这会我将几石粮一次卖给国家，余款都存上。”该村李殿起准备春天买马，把钱存入银行，既可保证不乱花掉，又可得几十万元利息。该村赵金海卖粮后得了二百万元，预备盖房，但三月才能解冻兴工，眼下合作社也没有房木。钱放在手里容易花掉，结果把余款都存入银行。
    农民积极节约储蓄，还可以稳定农村市场，以便国家更有计划地供应农村所需的物资。
    农民积极参加储蓄，还可以帮助国家积聚资金，加速国家建设，而国家各项建设事业发展了，对农民的长远利益更是有好处的。有人说，我存的钱少，十万八万的，过几个月又取出来了，顶不了国家的用途。这是不对的。俗话说：“积少成多”。我们国家人多，大家储蓄，你取他存，留在银行的储蓄总额仍然不少。目前由于工人、农民、市民和其它阶层人民踊跃储蓄，全国人民储蓄总额已有十二万多亿元，这笔钱可以使国家给人民作很多事情的。
    优待售粮储蓄对农民虽然有上面说的很多好处，但是有些农民对参加储蓄还有些不必要的顾虑。
    有人怀疑银行会给优厚的利息，认为把钱放在口袋里，更稳妥一些。这种怀疑，只要对比事实，弄清道理，就可以消除了。人民政府是为人民办事的，几年来帮助农民减租退押，土地改革，兴修农田水利，发展农业生产，那一条不是说到作到。人民银行在人民政府领导下，几年来在农村发放农贷，利息只取一分（有些贷款只有七厘五），确是不计赢亏的来为农民服务的。农村储蓄的目的，也是为农民服务。农村储蓄办得早的地方，农民已经从亲身体验中知道了储蓄的好处。例如广东梅县的农民，攒一个钱向银行存一个钱，存够数，买了一百三十多头牛。广东阳江县闸坡港的渔民，过去出海打鱼，多打了鱼卖掉大吃大喝，经银行人员宣传和帮助才改变习惯，从前年冬天开始，每次去海回来就存上一部分钱，到去年七月生产旺季，添置了深水、浅水打鱼用的船一百六十七艘，打的鱼比前年多出百分之三十以上。他们把人民银行称为自己的 “账房”。
    有人害怕物价上涨，票子毛了，储蓄吃亏。由于全国工业农业生产的发展，财政收支平衡，物资供应正常，国营公司和合作社掌握了充足的物资储备，收购粮食后并掌握了充分的粮食供应市场，因此物价是确定地继续平稳的，票子毛不了。即使个别地区、某一种物资发生供求失调时，国营商店和合作社也能完全有力量调运物资，以供应农民的需要，稳定市场。因此这种顾虑是不必要的。
    有些农民说：“谷子卖了，钱存银行，太麻烦了。”这方面银行已经采取或者正在采取许多办法，来尽量便利农民。银行除在许多集镇设有营业所外，还委托了供销合作社、信用合作社代办储蓄。江苏南汇大团区人民银行营业所，前年冬天吸收了农民储蓄，去年春耕生产期间，便主动派人下乡兑付储蓄，农民认为“银行把钞票送到村里来，帮助我们生产，只有人民自己的银行才能这样作。”虽然每个营业所不一定都能作到送款下乡，但尽量的方便农民的存取，则是一定的。
    总之，储蓄对农民是只有好处而无坏处的。浙江新登县岁寒村农民沃海海卖了一千九百斤谷子，得款一百三十二万元，马上存上一百二十万元，他说：“卖了余粮把暂时用不着的钱存银行有三大好处，第一，帮助国家工业建设；第二，银行把存进去的钞票翻身调头，贷款帮助困难农民；第三，钞票储蓄后不会散掉，又有利息，明年取出来买肥料最得时。”农民售粮储蓄，是爱国的、支援国家工业建设的行为，同时又是更好地安排自己的生产生活的方法。只要结合总路线宣传，把这道理向农民说清楚，农民是会踊跃地售粮和储蓄的。
