Vigorously Purchase Economic Construction Bonds

Since the Central People's Government announced the order for the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds, the promotion of bonds has begun in a few areas of the country, but most areas will fully launch in February. In areas where bond promotion has already begun, many workers, farmers, government organs, the People's Liberation Army, the Chinese People's Volunteers, and private industrialists and businessmen are actively subscribing to the bonds. Staff members of Beijing's city and district-level Party and government organs and mass organizations successfully completed their subscriptions within two days, exceeding the planned figure. Tianjin has basically completed its bond promotion work. As of the 27th, the city had subscribed to over 420 billion yuan, exceeding the figure allocated to North China by more than 31 percent. Staff members of Northeast China's first-level organs and central units stationed in Northeast China exceeded the planned figure for bonds by January 15th, successfully concluding the subscription campaign. The Chinese People's Liberation Army's troops in the Central South region had overfulfilled the bond subscription figure by January 5th. The leading organs of the Chinese People's Volunteers stationed in Korea had overfulfilled the estimated subscription figure by 511 percent by January 5th. The enthusiasm for bond subscriptions has been continuously emerging throughout the country, and we firmly believe that the promotion of the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds will achieve the expected victory.

Currently, the whole country is continuing to publicize and study the general line of the state during the transition period. The enthusiasm of the people for building socialism has greatly increased. The country's socialist industrialization and the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and capitalist industry and commerce are being accelerated, and all tasks have been improved. Undoubtedly, the publicity, subscription, and payment of national construction bonds must also be closely linked with the publicity of the general line and various central tasks, so that bond work becomes a step in deepening the publicity of the general line and a force in promoting various central tasks. The successful completion of bond work should become the result of in-depth publicity of the general line and the smooth development of central tasks. It is necessary to avoid conducting bond publicity separately from the publicity of the general line, and to avoid conducting bond work separately from the current central tasks.

In order to promote the patriotic spirit of the broad masses of workers and staff and actively subscribe to bonds, it is necessary to combine this with the completion of production plans, and to publicize to the working class the particularly important responsibility in the great historical task of realizing the state's general line during the transition period. The responsibility of our country's working class is to play an exemplary role in all patriotic work. First of all, we must strive to increase production and practice economy on the production front, launch labor competitions, and strive to complete and overfulfill the state's production plans and basic construction plans, so as to create increasing wealth for the country. Facts have proven that in the three or four years since liberation, the creative labor of our country's working class has already achieved tremendous and brilliant achievements on the industrial production front. However, in order to raise funds for industrialization, the working class should also actively support the state's measures to issue bonds and fulfill its due responsibilities in the issuance of bonds. Facts have proven that our country's working class fully understands the important significance of the state's issuance of bonds. For example, Hou Xiubo, a worker at the Chengzi Coal Mine in Beijing, said: "I have personally experienced the benefits that the development of industry brings to us. Before 1950, we still used hand hammers to drill holes, and we used manpower for everything. By 1951, we had pneumatic hammers, electric drills, and pneumatic picks. Now we have coal cutters. But we know that building factories and manufacturing machines requires money. Where does the money come from? It mainly relies on us to create wealth through production, and the issuance of bonds is also an important method for accumulating industrialization funds." This shows that our country's working class has not only made great contributions to national construction with its labor, but it will also play a positive and exemplary role in this bond purchase. Of course, our country's working class is also in a position to purchase bonds today. Because, in recent years, due to the recovery and development of our country's industrial production, the wages of employees in various regions have been adjusted to some extent. At the same time, due to the state's widespread implementation of the labor insurance system, the various collective welfare undertakings organized within enterprises, and the fact that workers do not currently have the burden of personal income tax, the actual income of the broad masses of workers and staff has been appropriately increased. Therefore, it will not only not affect the daily life of the broad masses of workers and staff economically, but also be another great contribution to socialist industrialization, in addition to actively working in production to accumulate construction funds for the country. This is a glorious act of promoting the noble qualities of the working class.

For the broad masses of farmers in our country, actively purchasing bonds to support the country's socialist industrialization is also inseparable from the vital interests of the farmers. Farmers should be educated to know that to further develop agricultural production, improve farmers' lives, and realize the socialist transformation of agriculture, it is necessary to rely on the gradual realization of the country's socialist industrialization. Only when the country has socialist industry can it produce more agricultural machinery to help farmers develop agricultural production, increase the supply of daily-use industrial products in rural areas, and continuously reduce the prices of industrial products, helping farmers to continuously improve their lives. In recent years, with the recovery and development of industrial production, our country's farmers have received great help from the state's industrial production in production. And only when the country realizes socialist industrialization can it help farmers transform decentralized, backward agriculture using manual tools into collective, advanced agriculture using various machines, thereby helping farmers embark on the happy life of socialist common prosperity. Farmers have clearly realized from their own lives that the country's socialist industrialization will never increase the burden on farmers, but will increase the actual income of farmers. Liu Bolin, an old farmer and member of the Gaokan Agricultural Production Cooperative in Gaokan Village, a suburb of Shenyang, said when he heard about the state's issuance of economic construction bonds: "It won't work without industrialization! This autumn, the machine threshed the grain, and 70,000 jin of sorghum was threshed in one and a half days, isn't that fast? If we used the old rollers left by our ancestors, it would take eight days, and we would need 40 head of livestock and 56 laborers, and it wouldn't be as clean as a machine. Not to mention that machines save money! Using the old hard stone rollers, these 40 head of livestock and 54 laborers would cost more than 2.4 million yuan in human and animal power, but what about using machines? Only 27 man-days, plus the cost of the machine, totals no more than 400,000 yuan. Where did the liberation of labor and the saving of wages come from? From industrialization! It is my responsibility to buy bonds to help the country build." Farmers should also be educated to know that the state's implementation of socialist industrialization does require a lot of funds, and these funds are mainly accumulated by the hard work of the working class and farmers. Only with the hard work of workers and farmers will the national economy develop more and socialist industrialization be more guaranteed, and with the development of socialist industrialization, farmers will be able to obtain more and more benefits. Actively organizing mutual aid and cooperation, striving to develop agricultural production, and selling surplus grain to the state are the main contributions of farmers to the cause of industrialization. But farmers should also actively support the state's measures to issue bonds and take out some of their surplus and possibly saved money to purchase national bonds. Farmers buying bonds is not a burden, but a kind of saving. If farmers have surplus money, they should never use it to buy land, lend money, hoard grain, or engage in speculative business, which is not good for the country or themselves. On the contrary, using surplus money to buy bonds is beneficial to both the country and themselves, and is a patriotic act.

For capitalist industrialists and businessmen, in recent years, thanks to the correct leadership of the state-owned economy and the help of state processing and ordering, they have recovered and developed from the state of lingering on the brink of death before liberation. Especially in 1953, the state continued to correctly implement the policy of utilizing, restricting, and transforming capitalist industry and commerce, and various forms of state capitalism have been considerably developed. In the industrial field, support was provided through various means of processing, ordering, purchasing, and sales consignment. In the commercial field, business relationships such as commodity exchanges and state-owned companies establishing agency purchases, sales, and wholesale businesses were established. Especially after the adjustment of commerce, capitalist industry and commerce businesses have all developed. Not only have enterprises accumulated funds, but investors have also obtained considerable profits. The development of joint state-private enterprises is even more prominent. Shareholders who had not received dividends for many years before the joint venture have received considerable dividends after the joint venture, and some have even received bonuses. On the whole, capitalist enterprises that are conducive to the national economy and the people's livelihood and are well-managed have all developed normally throughout the country. For example, the turnover of capitalist industry and commerce in the eight major cities of Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Guangzhou, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Shenyang: from January to September 1953 increased by more than 22 percent compared with the same period in 1951, and increased by more than 68 percent compared with 1952. The total processing profit of capitalist industry in Shenyang in the first half of 1953 increased by more than four times compared with the same period in 1952. According to statistics on December 15, 1953, the deposits of capitalist industry and commerce in banks in Tianjin increased by 185 percent compared with 1950. Under these circumstances, the specific manifestation of the patriotism of capitalist industrialists and businessmen in supporting the state's general line during the transition period, in addition to accepting socialist transformation and striving to operate, is also their inescapable duty to take out a portion of their profits to purchase bonds. Capitalist industrialists and businessmen have accumulated a lot of floating capital due to the development of production and operation in recent years. This floating capital should never be used to engage in speculative activities that damage the national economy and the people's livelihood, but should be used to do things that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Purchasing bonds is one of the things that are beneficial to the national economy and the people's livelihood. Capitalist industrialists and businessmen who purchase bonds can not only recover the principal on schedule and receive a certain amount of interest, but also support national economic construction economically and fulfill their patriotic responsibilities politically. For other urban residents, especially those with real estate income, interest income, and more savings, it is also necessary to inspire their patriotic ideas and mobilize them to actively subscribe to bonds with a portion of their income.

Subscribing to national economic construction bonds must be a great, conscious, and voluntary patriotic action of the people, and the economic capacity of the purchasers must be taken into account. In publicity and promotion work, it is correct to explain that the people's active subscription to bonds is a patriotic act; but do not put forward the wrong slogan that "not subscribing to bonds is not patriotic." It is correct to create a warm atmosphere of purchasing bonds through publicity throughout the country; but do not create an atmosphere that "not subscribing to or subscribing to less bonds is not glorious or unpatriotic," so as to avoid forcing those who are really unable to purchase bonds to purchase or purchase more reluctantly; pay special attention to this for the masses in disaster areas and impoverished areas, and for farmers in difficulty. In publicity, it is also necessary to avoid putting forward wrong slogans such as "save on food and clothing to subscribe to bonds" or "the more the better" or "the more you buy, the more patriotic you are," and do not launch "competitions," do not encourage "challenges," and do not advocate selling clothes or buying bonds with all the salaries for several months, so as to avoid affecting the lives of subscribers as a result of buying bonds.

We firmly believe that because this national economic construction bond is issued on the basis of the restoration and development of our country's national economy and the gradual improvement of people's lives, it has the favorable conditions for successful completion. But for Party organizations and governments at all levels, it is also necessary to strengthen leadership over bond promotion work and seriously value and do a good job in publicity and education. It must be recognized that the symbol of the successful completion of this national economic construction bond is not only to complete the bond figure of six trillion yuan, but also to further improve the patriotic awareness of the people of all strata and encourage the people of the whole country to actively participate in and support the country's planned economic construction work through the promotion and subscription of this national economic construction bond.

### 踊跃购买经济建设公债

　　踊跃购买经济建设公债
    自从中央人民政府公布了一九五四年国家经济建设公债的命令后，全国少数地区公债推销工作已经开始，但绝大部分地区将在二月全面开展。在公债推销工作已经开始的地区，许多工人、农民、机关、人民解放军、中国人民志愿军和私营工商业者都踊跃地认购公债。北京市级及区级党政机关和群众团体的工作人员在两天内就胜利地完成了认购工作，并超过了预定数字。天津市推销公债的工作已基本结束，到二十七日止，全市认购四千二百亿多元，超过华北分配的数字百分之三十一强。东北一级机关工作人员及中央驻东北各单位工作人员在一月十五日已超过公债预订数字，胜利结束了认购活动。中国人民解放军中南地区的部队已在一月五日超额完成了认购公债数字。远在朝鲜的中国人民志愿军领导机关至一月五日已超额完成了认购预计数字的百分之五百一十一。全国各地认购公债的热情已不断涌现出来，我们深信：一九五四年国家经济建设公债的推销工作定将取得预期的胜利。
    现在，全国正在继续宣传和学习国家在过渡时期的总路线，全国人民建设社会主义的热情大大提高，国家社会主义工业化和对农业、手工业和资本主义工商业的社会主义改造的工作都在加紧进行，各项工作都有所改进。无疑地，推销国家建设公债的宣传、认购和缴纳工作也必须密切结合总路线的宣传和各项中心工作来进行，使公债工作成为深入总路线宣传的一个步骤、成为推动各项中心工作的一个力量；使公债工作的胜利完成变为总路线深入宣传和中心工作顺利开展的结果；要避免脱离总路线的宣传来单独进行公债宣传，避免脱离当前中心工作来单独进行公债工作。
    为了发扬广大职工群众的爱国主义精神，踊跃地认购公债，必须结合完成生产计划，向工人阶级宣传在实现国家过渡时期总路线的伟大历史任务中的特别重大的责任。我国工人阶级的责任就是在一切爱国工作中起模范作用。首先在生产战线上努力增产节约，开展劳动竞赛，努力完成和超额完成国家的生产计划和基本建设计划，为国家创造日益增多的财富。事实证明：在解放后的三四年来，我国工人阶级的创造性的劳动，已经在工业生产战线上取得了巨大的辉煌的成就。但是为了筹集工业化的资金，工人阶级还应当积极支持国家发行公债的措施，在发行公债中尽到自己应有的责任。事实证明：我国工人阶级是十分懂得国家发行公债的重要意义的。如北京市城子煤矿工人侯修伯说：“我亲身体会到发展工业给我们带来的好处。一九五○年以前，我们还用手锤打眼，干活尽用人力。到一九五一年就有风锤、电钻、风镐等工具了，现在又有了割煤机。但是我们知道，建设工厂、制造机器需要花钱。钱从那里来呢？主要靠我们搞生产创造财富，而发行公债也是积累工业化资金的重要方法。”这说明我国工人阶级不但以自己的劳动为国家建设作出了巨大的贡献，他们在这次购买公债中也将发挥了积极的模范作用。当然，我国工人阶级今天也是有条件来购买公债的。因为，这几年来由于我国工业生产的恢复和发展，各地职工的工资都经过某些调整，同时，由于国家广泛实行了劳动保险制度，由于企业内举办了各种集体的福利事业，由于目前工人还没有个人所得税的负担，广大职工的实际所得已有了适当的提高。因此，我国广大职工拿出一部分余钱来购买公债，这不仅在经济上不影响职工日常生活，而且也是工人阶级除了在生产中积极劳动给国家积累建设资金外，再一次地给社会主义工业化作出的巨大贡献。这是发扬工人阶级崇高品质的一种光荣行为。
    对我国广大农民来说，踊跃地购买公债，支援国家的社会主义工业化也是和农民的切身利益分不开的。应该教育农民们知道：要进一步发展农业生产，改善农民生活，对农业实现社会主义的改造，就要依靠国家社会主义工业化的逐步实现。只有国家有了社会主义的工业，国家才能够生产更多的农业机器来帮助农民发展农业生产，才能够增加农村日用工业品的供应，并不断地降低工业品的价格，帮助农民不断改善生活。这几年来，我国农民随着工业生产的恢复和发展，在生产方面已得到国家工业生产的巨大帮助。而且只有国家实现了社会主义工业化，国家才能够帮助农民把分散的、落后的、使用手工工具的农业改造成为集体的、先进的、使用各种机器的农业，从而帮助农民走上社会主义的共同富裕的幸福生活。农民们从切身生活中明确地认识到：国家社会主义工业化决不会增加农民的负担，还会增加农民的实际收入。沈阳市郊高坎村高坎农业生产合作社社员刘柏林老汉在听到国家发行经济建设公债时说：“没有工业化不行啊！今秋机器打场，一天半就打了七万斤高粱，快不？若使咱那祖祖辈辈留下来的老滚子呀，就得八天，还得四十匹牲口、五十六个劳动力，也没有机器打得干净。这还不说，机器干，还省费用呀！使老硬的石滚子干，这四十匹牲口和五十四个劳动力，人力马力得二百四十多万元，可是机器干呢？只二十七个人工，连加机器费用，共计不过四十万元。解放了劳动力，又省工钱，这些好处从那里来？打工业化来的呀！买公债帮助国家建设就是我的责任。”还应该教育农民们知道：国家实行社会主义工业化，确实需要很多资金，这笔资金主要是由工人阶级和农民努力劳动积累起来的。只有工人和农民的努力劳动，国家经济就越会发展，社会主义工业化就越有保证，而随着社会主义工业化的发展，农民们就能得到越来越多的好处。积极组织起来互助合作，努力发展农业生产，并把余粮卖给国家，这是农民对于工业化建设事业的主要贡献。但是农民也应当积极拥护国家发行公债的措施，拿出自己一部分多余的和可能节省的钱来购买国家公债。农民购买公债不但不是负担，而是一种储蓄。农民有了余钱，决不应该拿去买地、放债、囤粮、做投机生意，这样对国家和自己都没有好处。相反的，拿余钱买公债，就是于国家于自己都是有利的，就是一种爱国行为。
    对于资本主义工商业者来说，几年来由于国营经济的正确领导和国家加工订货的帮助，由解放前的苟延残喘奄奄一息的状态下，得到了恢复和发展。特别是一九五三年当中，国家对资本主义工商业继续正确地执行了利用、限制和改造政策，各种形式的国家资本主义都有了相当的发展。工业方面通过加工、订货、收购、包销各种方式的扶植，商业方面通过各地物资交流以及国营公司建立代购、代销、批购等业务关系，特别在调整商业之后，资本主义工商业业务都得到了发展，不但企业积累了资金，资方也获得了相当的利润。而公私合营的企业发展的更为突出，未合营前多少年没有拿到股息的，在合营后股东都分到相当数额的股息，有的还分到红利。整个地看来，在全国范围内，凡有利于国计民生，并经营得当的资本主义企业都得到了正常的发展。如北京、天津、上海、武汉、广州、重庆、西安、沈阳八大城市资本主义工商业营业额：一九五三年一至九月份比一九五一年同期增加百分之二十二强，比一九五二年增加百分之六十八强。沈阳市全市资本主义工业在一九五三年上半年所得加工利润总额比一九五二年同期增加四倍多。天津市资本主义工商业一九五三年十二月十五日统计，全市资本主义工商业在银行的存款比一九五○年增加了百分之一百八十五。在这种情况下，资本主义工商业者拥护国家过渡时期总路线的爱国主义的具体表现，除了接受社会主义改造、努力经营以外，拿出一部分利润购买公债，也是义不容辞的。资本主义工商业数年来由于生产和经营的发展，已拥有不少游资，这些游资决不应该拿去做破坏国计民生的投机活动，而应拿出来做有益于国计民生的事情，购买公债就是有利于国计民生的事情之一。资本主义工商业者购买公债，既可按期收回本金，拿到一定利息，又在经济上支持了国家经济建设，在政治上尽了自己一份爱国的责任。对于其他城市居民，特别是有房地产收入的和有利息收入的、以及有较多积蓄的居民，也应启发他们的爱国主义思想，动员他们以一部分收入积极地认购公债也是必要的。
    认购国家经济建设公债必须是人民伟大的自觉自愿的爱国行动，必须切实照顾到购买者的经济能力。在宣传和推销工作中，说明人民踊跃认购公债是爱国行为，这是正确的；但不要提出“不认购公债就是不爱国”的错误口号。在全国各地通过宣传造成一种购买公债的热烈气氛，是正确的；但不要造成“不认购或少认购公债就是不光荣不爱国”的气氛，以免迫使确实无力购买公债的人勉强购买或多买；特别是对于灾区和贫瘠地区的群众，对有困难的农民，更要注意这一点。在宣传中还切忌提出“节衣缩食认购公债”、或“多多益善”、“越多购就越爱国”等错误口号，更不要发动“竞赛”，不要鼓动“挑战”，不要提倡卖衣物或以若干月的全部薪金购买公债，以免使购买公债的结果影响认购者的生活。
    我们深信：由于这次国家经济建设公债是在我国国民经济恢复和发展、人民生活逐步提高的基础上发行的，因此它具备着胜利完成的有利条件。但对各级党的组织和各级政府来说，还必须切实地加强对公债推销工作的领导，认真重视和做好宣传教育工作。必须认识到：这次胜利完成国家经济建设公债的标志，不只是要完成了六万亿元的公债数字，而且要通过这次国家经济建设公债的推销和认购，进一步提高各阶层人民的爱国主义觉悟，鼓舞全国人民踊跃地参加和支持国家的有计划经济建设工作热情。
