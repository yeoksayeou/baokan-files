Condolences to Compatriots in Kowloon Affected by Fire

On December 25, 1953, a major fire broke out in the wooden shanty town area of Sham Shui Po, Kowloon, destroying nearly ten thousand wooden houses and leaving tens of thousands of victims homeless and facing starvation and cold.

The Chinese People's Government and the broad masses of the people express their infinite concern for the Kowloon compatriots who have suffered this disaster. The Guangdong Provincial Branch and Guangzhou Municipal Branch of the Chinese People's Relief Administration have already allocated 1 billion yuan in Renminbi and transported 700,000 jin of rice for emergency relief to the fire-stricken compatriots in Kowloon, allowing tens of thousands of compatriots to feel the warmth of the great motherland in the disaster. Compatriots from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon have also enthusiastically donated money and clothing, launching a disaster relief campaign and demonstrating the spirit of unity and mutual assistance among our compatriots.

The continuous occurrence of bizarre fires in Kowloon cannot but attract people's attention. On November 21, 1951, Tung Tau Tsuen in Kowloon was burned down, and the burned area of Tung Tau Tsuen was later converted into an airport. Subsequently, on April 30, 1952, another 2,000 wooden houses in Kowloon Tsai were reduced to ashes. These major fires have caused great losses to our residents in Kowloon. Since 1952, the Chinese People's Relief Administration has remitted funds nine times to assist fire-stricken compatriots in Kowloon. However, after each fire, the British authorities in Hong Kong not only failed to provide effective relief to the affected residents, but often used this as an excuse to persecute them. Taking the situation after the major fire in the Sham Shui Po wooden shanty town area as an example, the British authorities in Hong Kong have imposed many unreasonable restrictions on the registration scope of the affected residents and made all kinds of unreasonable difficulties for the victims who lost their "identity cards" in the fire. Such unreasonable behavior by the British authorities in Hong Kong, disregarding the interests of our residents, cannot but arouse the attention and dissatisfaction of the broad masses of the Chinese people.

The frequent occurrence of major fires in Kowloon is clearly not accidental. Under the long-term rule of British imperialism, the broad masses of working people in Kowloon toil hard but cannot even feed and clothe themselves, and are forced to live in wooden houses, with extremely harsh living conditions. The wooden shanty town areas of these poor residents are overcrowded and lack water, electricity, and fire-fighting equipment, which has created the frequent occurrence of fires. The British authorities in Hong Kong either ignore the residents' housing and safety issues, neglecting the lives and property of the residents, or take brutal measures, forcing residents to demolish their houses and relocate, without providing them with proper resettlement. Therefore, the British authorities in Hong Kong must bear significant responsibility for the losses and suffering brought by this major fire to our residents in Kowloon. In order to prevent such major fires from occurring in the Kowloon area in the future, the British authorities in Hong Kong should promptly take reasonable measures agreed to by the people and provide effective solutions and guarantees for the housing and safety issues of our poor residents in Kowloon.

### 慰问九龙遭受火灾的同胞

    慰问九龙遭受火灾的同胞
    一九五三年十二月二十五日，九龙深水埠木屋区发生大火灾，近万间木屋被烧毁，数万灾民流离失所，处于饥寒交迫的困境中。
    我国人民政府和广大人民对于遭此浩劫的九龙同胞，都表示无限的关怀。中国人民救济总会广东省分会和广州市分会已经拨款人民币十亿元，运送大米七十万斤，对九龙受灾同胞进行紧急救济，使数万同胞在灾难中感到伟大祖国给他们的温暖。而香港九龙各界同胞，也踊跃捐款赠衣，展开救灾运动，表现了我国同胞团结互助的精神。
    九龙不断发生离奇的大火灾，不能不引起人们的注意。一九五一年十一月二十一日，九龙东头村被焚，事后东头村被焚地区即被辟为飞机场。其后，一九五二年四月三十日，九龙仔又有木屋二千间烧为灰烬。这些大火灾使九龙的我国居民遭到极大损失。自一九五二年起，中国人民救济总会曾先后汇款九次，援助九龙受灾同胞。但是香港英国当局，在各次火灾发生后，不但不对受灾居民加以切实的救济，反而经常借此对他们进行迫害。以这次深水埠木屋区大火灾发生后的情形来说，香港英国当局对于受灾居民的登记范围又加以许多不合理的限制，对于在火灾中遗失“身份证”的灾民进行种种无理的刁难。香港英国当局这种不顾我国居民利益的不合理的行为，不能不引起我国广大人民的注意和不满。
    九龙经常发生大火灾，显然不是偶然的。在英帝国主义的长期统治下，九龙广大劳动人民，胼手胝足，不得温饱，被迫以木屋栖身，生活条件十分恶劣。这些贫苦居民的木屋区拥挤不堪，又缺乏水电和消防设备，造成了火患频仍的原因。香港英国当局对于居民的居住和安全问题，或者漠然不顾，玩忽居民的生命财产；或者采取横暴的手段，强迫居民拆屋迁居，却又不对他们加以妥善的安置。因此，香港英国当局对于这一次大火给九龙我国居民带来的损失和痛苦，不能不负有重大责任。为使九龙地区今后不再发生这种大火灾，香港英国当局应迅速采取为人民所同意的合理措施，对九龙我国贫苦居民的居住和安全问题，加以切实的解决和保障。
