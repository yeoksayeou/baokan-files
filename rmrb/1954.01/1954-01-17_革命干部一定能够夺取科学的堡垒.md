    “Some of the things we are familiar with are about to become idle, and the things we are unfamiliar with are forcing us to do.

    “We must overcome difficulties, we must learn things we don't understand. We must learn economic work from all experts (no matter who they are)." Chairman Mao's brilliant prediction and instruction in his book "On the People's Democratic Dictatorship" are all the more demonstrating its unparalleled correctness and importance today when the general line and general task of the state's transition period are placed before us, and it also attracts everyone's attention.

    Speaking of economic work, we easily think of organization and management. To truly do this work well, a certain amount of scientific and technological knowledge is also essential. The objects dealt with by production-related science and technology are various substances, which are problems belonging to the realm of natural science, involving many nouns and terms. Some cadres are unfamiliar with these things, which makes them shake their heads when they encounter these problems and say: I don't understand science.

    Is natural science really that difficult to understand? At first glance, there seem to be many mysteries in it. Open a book on materials science and you will see a large pile of formulas and numbers, and a chemical reagent order form full of rare strange characters. These things have become the so-called "roadblocks" for many cadres in learning economic work, so everyone feels that natural science is difficult to understand. In fact, natural science is the true and reliable knowledge that reflects the laws of nature. This knowledge has been accumulated by mankind through production practice and scientific research. It is neither mysterious nor magical. Anyone who patiently studies it can completely understand it.

    In order to realize the general line of the state's transition period, and in order to complete the general task of building a socialist society, revolutionary cadres must march towards science and will surely capture the fortress of science. Natural science is not difficult to learn; the key is how to start learning.

    I recently read more than two hundred letters written by readers to the editorial department of "Popular Science." The vast majority of them were written by middle school students, followed by revolutionary soldiers and revolutionary cadres. From these letters, we can see that the enthusiasm of cadres for learning science is growing day by day. Some cadres ask for the introduction of scientific reading materials that can be self-taught; some raise natural phenomena they have seen, hoping to get scientific explanations; some raise questions in their work and study and request answers. For example, a comrade who was recently transferred to the production department to manage a cold storage wrote a long letter and drew a sketch of the refrigeration machine there, hoping that the editorial department could tell him the principle of the refrigeration machine. These all show that revolutionary cadres are indeed becoming more and more fond of science.

    From these letters, it can also be seen that some people do not have a sufficient understanding of the accumulative nature of scientific knowledge itself and the sequential nature of learning. They often raise some very advanced and specialized questions that go beyond their current level of scientific knowledge. A rural cadre wrote a letter hoping to know the specific design of atomic energy in peaceful industrial applications; judging from the wording of his letter, he seemed to lack basic concepts about atoms, and he thought that atoms were fuels like coal and gasoline. Asking questions in this way is somewhat divorced from the practical basis of learning science.

    Some enthusiastic cadres and youths also put forward some mechanical design suggestions. For example, suggesting "artificial mountain springs" to "suck" water from mountain ditches to the top of the mountain and then use it for irrigation; there are also various "automatic waterwheel" designs; a more universal suggestion is a "perpetual motion machine" (a machine that can run forever with only one burning of coal). Some people see that gasoline is very precious, so they propose methods to replace gasoline with water. The motives of these letter writers are admirable. For the needs of the country's construction, they are willing to work day and night to use their brains and put forward "rationalization proposals," which should be encouraged. Indeed, within three years, more than 489,000 rationalization proposals put forward by workers across the country have been adopted and implemented, greatly increasing the country's wealth. With the development of the country's industrial construction, workers will surely have more and better rationalization proposals to put forward and be adopted. However, the workers' rationalization proposals are very different from these proposals. These are specific improvement methods proposed by the workers in production practice based on their actual experience. Many are in line with scientific principles and are practical and feasible. As for the suggestions of these cadres and youths, many are obviously not in line with scientific principles and cannot be realized. If they learn the necessary basic scientific theories, they will not waste a lot of energy engaging in futile designs. From this, we can see the importance of learning basic scientific knowledge.

    A revolutionary cadre with a junior high school education level (mainly referring to language skills), who is determined to learn some scientific knowledge, where should he start?

    Science has had a long history of development. Natural science originated from the practical experience of human production and life. For thousands of years, especially in the past four hundred years, due to the needs and promotion of social production and the efforts of many scientists, it has gradually risen from the lower stage of perceptual phenomenon recording to the stage of rational system theory. These theories have been tested by practice in the laboratory; later, most of them have been tested by production practice, so they all correctly reflect the objective reality of nature. We must trust these theories. To learn some natural science, we must understand the basic theories in science.

    The things in nature and their changes have certain laws. Natural science takes these things and their changes as the object of study. After more than four hundred years of accumulation and development in modern times, natural science has occupied an extremely vast field in all human knowledge. Its objects are many, its scope is wide, and its development is fast. Therefore, natural science must be divided into many categories, and new categories are constantly being produced. It is impossible for anyone to delve into all categories of science, and it is not necessary for a person's work to learn all sciences. What needs to be understood here first is: which scientific knowledge is the most basic, and which is professional knowledge built on basic scientific knowledge. Basic science is the minimum knowledge that people who are willing to learn science must master; everyone understands the principle that a good house can only be built if the foundation is laid well.

    Which are the basic sciences? In my opinion, there are only three: mathematics, physics, and chemistry. A cadre who manages machinery manufacturing may not understand botany, but he must have the basic knowledge of these three basic sciences: mathematics, physics, and chemistry. A farm manager may not understand mineralogy at all, but if he lacks common sense of mathematics, physics, and chemistry, his work will be difficult to improve. Botany and mineralogy are sciences close to the scope of professional knowledge, and they themselves must be based on mathematics, physics, and chemistry, so they are not regarded as basic sciences. To march towards science, we must start with these three basic sciences: mathematics, physics, and chemistry. If the starting point is not right, it will be counterproductive.

    Does such a statement mean that everyone should make up for the science courses in junior high school? Will it prolong the time for learning science, drag it on indefinitely, and fail to solve the current problems? Moreover, can these basic sciences be self-taught without a teacher? Is such a statement divorced from reality?

    These questions should be answered clearly.

    Revolutionary cadres do not need to repeat all the science courses of junior high school. Many of the scientific subjects set up for the education of young people and teenagers have been acquired by revolutionary cadres in their work and life. For example, addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division in arithmetic can be obtained in life experience, and of course, there is no need to learn it from arithmetic books again. However, scientific mathematics has greatly improved the calculation in life experience, and it has been abstractly synthesized into many principles. Among these principles, some have become indispensable weapons for engaging in any scientific and technological work.

    In the vast field of mathematics, algebra is the most important foundation, and the solution of linear equations and systems of linear equations in algebra is essential knowledge for any calculation work. A revolutionary cadre who is determined to learn science can learn about linear equations and systems of linear equations from any junior high school algebra book; by studying for three hours a week, it is possible to acquire some basic mathematical knowledge in four or five weeks. This is not empty talk, but completely achievable. I do not recommend books such as "Mathematical Games" or "Interesting Mathematics" to everyone, which are extracurricular reading materials for middle school students and can help cultivate an interest in mathematics, but cannot quickly and effectively solve the problem of learning mathematics.

    With basic knowledge of algebra, you can learn physics and chemistry. The object of mathematics is the more abstract quantitative relationship and the law of quantitative change, while the objects studied by physics and chemistry are much more specific. They are the sciences about the relationship between substances and the laws of motion, so you can start with things related to life to understand the principles of these two sciences. There are two kinds of reading materials written by Soviet scientists that can be used as an introduction to learning. Both of these reading materials start from the surrounding things and rise to theory to explain them, which enables us to start from perceptual knowledge and gradually rise to the stage of rational knowledge.

    One is "Physics for Entertainment" written by Perelman, and the Chinese translation has recently been published by China Youth Publishing House. Perelman is a Soviet erudite popular science writer. He has dozens of works in his life, which are all welcomed by the vast number of Soviet readers. The main purpose of this "Physics for Entertainment" is to stimulate the activity of scientific imagination and enable readers to obtain physical knowledge from the explanation of various life phenomena. The original text is rich in literary quality and is very interesting to read, and the translation is also smooth. In terms of learning the basic knowledge of physics, this book can be listed as an enlightenment reading material. However, because it focuses too much on the vivid and interesting side, scientific nouns are rarely used, there are no formulas at all, and there are also some stories that have little to do with science mixed in; there is no material on atomic physics at all, so after reading this book, it is still far from enough to master the most basic physics knowledge.

    If you want to get relatively barely enough physics knowledge, you still have to take a physics textbook at the junior high school level and study it carefully after reading "Physics for Entertainment." General junior high school physics takes two years to teach. If we ask revolutionary cadres to systematically learn two years of physics, that is certainly not realistic. I would like to suggest this: mechanics, heat, and electromagnetism in physics have the greatest relationship with modern industrial production, and the rest has less relationship. A transferred cadre participating in industrial construction can study these three parts of junior high school physics, and the time and energy spent is not too great. Roughly estimated, studying for three hours a week, four months is enough. Having such a foundation will be of great help for further mastering the knowledge of machinery and electrical machinery.

    Regarding an introductory reading material on chemistry, I would like to recommend Rubinstein's "Chemistry Around Us." This book has Chinese translations published by China Youth Publishing House and Commercial Press, and the translations are both smooth. This book also extends from specific phenomena to theory. It is deeper than the book "Physics for Entertainment" and uses a lot of element symbols and chemical formulas, which is laborious for people who have never studied chemistry at all; but if you can seriously read it once, you will indeed gain a considerable amount of basic chemical knowledge.

    Here, I think we should talk about the problem of scientific nouns and symbols. Frankly speaking, to learn science, you must learn the nouns and symbols used in science. In any case, this is unavoidable. To use an analogy, revolutionary theory cannot avoid nouns such as "socialism," "class struggle," and "surplus value"; without these nouns, how can we express revolutionary theory? Similarly, in natural science, without nouns such as "density," "resistance," "oxidation," and "reduction," it is impossible to obtain the correct concept of science. Stalin told us in his brilliant work "Marxism and Problems of Linguistics": "No matter what ideas are produced in people's minds, and when these ideas are produced, they can only be produced and exist on the basis of the material of language, on the basis of the terms and phrases of language." Therefore, scientists deeply feel that in order for scientific knowledge and theories to exist in our minds, they must be based on appropriate nouns and symbols, otherwise, it is impossible to truly understand science. These nouns and symbols are indeed unfamiliar to many of our cadres, but they must be regarded as the foundation of scientific knowledge to be mastered. This is one of the biggest difficulties we need to overcome in capturing the fortress of science.

    Assuming that everyone agrees with my suggestion, starting with the preliminary algebra, physics, and chemistry, each person formulates a self-study plan based on the specific situation of their spare time and persists for half a year. I think that by then, they will not feel at a loss when they see a blueprint, and they will not hesitate when facing a trade order form. Starting from this foundation, and then delving into scientific knowledge related to each person's profession, there will be no problem of advancing by leaps and bounds, and energy will not be spent on laborious and useless fantasies. At the same time, they will be more confident that they can gradually become scientific and technological experts; and when learning from Soviet experts, they will also have more sufficient conditions.

    As for general science brochures and science journals, they can of course play an auxiliary role in learning science. They can constantly use new materials to encourage the learning mood, and deepen our love for science due to frequent contact with these reading materials. But to truly acquire scientific knowledge, it is difficult to think of other methods to replace it except for regular, gradual, and planned self-study. Systematic self-study is the most reliable weapon to capture the fortress of science. Open the first volume of "Capital" and you can see the words of the great revolutionary teacher Marx, who told us: "There is no smooth road in science, only those who are not afraid of hard work in climbing the rugged path have the hope of reaching the brilliant peak." His words are an irrefutable truth. Let us always remember the famous saying of the revolutionary teacher and march towards science steadily and surely.

    革命干部一定能够夺取科学的堡垒
    袁翰青
    “我们熟习的东西有些快要闲起来了，我们不熟习的东西正在强迫我们去做。
    “我们必须克服困难，我们必须学会自己不懂的东西。我们必须向一切内行的人们（不管什么人）学经济工作。”毛主席在“论人民民主专政”一书中的这一天才预见和指示，在国家过渡时期总路线和总任务摆在我们面前的今天，愈加显示出它的无比的正确性和重要性，也格外引起大家的重视。
    说到经济工作，我们很容易想到组织管理。要真正作好这项工作，没有一定的科学技术知识也是不行的。有关生产的科学技术所处理的对象是形形色色的物质，是属于自然科学范围里的问题，它牵涉到许多名词和术语。有一部分干部对这些东西是生疏的，这就使得他们在遇到这些问题时，就会摇起头来，说：我可不懂科学。
    自然科学真的是那么难懂吗？粗粗地看来，这里面似乎有许多奥密。翻开一本谈材料学的书一看，一大堆的算式和数字，一张化学药品订货单满是些少见的怪字。这些东西成了许多干部学习经济工作中的所谓“拦路虎”，因此，大家感到自然科学难懂。其实，自然科学是反映自然界的规律的真实可靠的知识。这些知识是人类通过了生产实践和科学研究所积累起来的，既不奥密，也不神奇。任何一个人只要耐心地钻研下去，是完全可以搞明白的。
    为了实现国家过渡时期的总路线，为了完成建设社会主义社会的总任务，革命干部必须向科学进军，并且一定能够夺取科学的堡垒。自然科学是不难学习的，问题的关键是在如何着手去学习。
    我最近阅读了一批读者写给“大众科学”编辑部的两百多封信件。其中绝大部分是中学同学写的，其次是革命军人和革命干部写的。从这些信里，我们可以看到干部们要求学习科学的热情是在日益增长。有些干部要求介绍可以自学的科学读物；有些提出自己所看到的自然现象，希望得到科学的解释；有些提出自己在工作中、学习中的问题请求解答。例如，有一位新近调到生产部门里管理冷藏库的同志，他写来一封长信，并且画了他那里的冷藏机的草图，希望编辑部能把冷藏机的原理告诉他。这些，都表示出，革命干部确实是愈来愈爱好科学了。
    从这些信件里，也可以看出有些人对于科学知识本身的积累性和学习的循序性是认识不足的，他们常常提出一些超越了自己现有科学知识水平的、很高深很专门的问题。有一位农村干部来信，希望知道原子能在和平工业应用中的具体设计；而就他的来信的措词来看，他似乎还缺乏关于原子的基本概念，他以为原子是像煤、汽油那样的燃料。这样地提问题就多少脱离了学习科学的实际基础了。
    还有些热心的干部和青年提出一些机械设计的建议。例如建议“人造山泉”，将山沟里的水“吸”上山头，然后用来灌溉；还有各种各样的“自动水车”的设计图；更带有普遍性的建议是“永动机”（只要烧一次煤就可以永久开动的机器）。也有一些人看到汽油很宝贵，就提出用水代替汽油的方法。这些来信者的动机都是值得敬佩的，为了祖国建设的需要，他们愿意废寝忘食地开动脑筋，提出“合理化建议”，本来是应当鼓励的。是的，三年之内，全国工人提出的合理化建议已被采纳实行的达四十八万九千多件，大大地增加了国家的财富。而随着国家工业建设的发展，工人们一定会有更多更好的合理化建议提出来，并被采用的。可是工人的合理化建议是和这些建议大不相同的。这是工人们在生产实践中，就他们的实际经验所提出的具体改进方法，许多是合乎科学原理的，切实可行的。至于这些干部和青年的建议，许多显然是不合乎科学原理的，不可能实现的。他们如果学习了必要的基本科学理论，就不会浪费许多精力去从事徒劳无功的设计了。从这里，可以看出学习基础科学知识的重要。
    一个有了初中文化水平（主要指语文水平）的革命干部，决心学习一些科学知识，究竟应当从那里着手呢？
    科学已经有了长期的发展历史。自然科学导源于人类生产和生活的实际经验。几千年来，尤其是近四百多年来，由于社会生产的需要、推动和许多科学家的努力，它已经从感性的现象记录的低级阶段，逐步上升到理性的系统理论的阶段。这些理论是经过了实验室的实践考验的；后来，绝大部分又经过了生产实践的考验，所以它们都是正确地反映自然界的客观实际的。我们必须信任这些理论。要学习一些自然科学，就必须懂得科学中的基本理论。
    自然界的事物和它们的变化是有一定规律的。自然科学便是以这些事物和它们的变化为研究对象。经过近代四百多年来的积累和发展，自然科学已经在全部人类知识中，占有了极其广大的领域。它的对象多、范围广，发展得又快。因此自然科学就必然要分成许多门类，并且不断地有新的门类产生。任何一个人不可能钻研到所有门类的科学中去，并且对于一个人的工作来说，也没有学习所有科学的必要。在这里首先要了解的是：那些科学知识是最基本的，而那些又是建筑在基础科学知识上的专业知识。基础科学是愿意学习科学的人所必须掌握的起码知识；打好了墙基才盖得好房子，这是谁也懂得的道理。
    那些是基础科学呢？据我看来，只有三门：数学、物理和化学。一个管理机械制造的干部可以不懂植物学，但他决不能没有数学、物理、化学这三门基础科学的起码知识。一个农场管理员可以完全不懂矿物学，但假使他缺乏数学、物理、化学的常识，他的工作是难以提高的。植物学和矿物学是接近于专业知识范围的科学，它们本身也须以数学、物理、化学为基础，所以不被视为基础科学。要向科学进军就得先从数学、物理和化学这三门基础科学着手。如果着手的地方不对头，那是会搞得事倍功半的。
    这样的提法，是不是说，要大家补习初级中学的科学课程呢？是不是会把学习科学的时间拉得很长，拖得遥遥无期，解决不了目前的问题呢？并且，这些基础科学能不能无师自通地自学下去呢？这样的提法是不是脱离实际呢？
    这些问题是应当解答清楚的。
    革命干部是毋须全部重复初级中学的科学课程的。那些为了青年和少年的教养而设置的科学科目，它们的教学内容有许多已为革命干部在工作中、生活中获得了。例如算术里的加法、减法、乘法、除法，便是在生活经验里可以得到的，当然不必再从算术书上去学了。可是科学的数学使生活经验里的计算大大地提高了，它已抽象地综合为许多原理。这些原理之中，有些成为从事任何科学技术工作所不可缺少的武器。
    在广大的数学领域里，代数是最重要的基础，而代数中间的一次方程式和一次联立方程式的解法又是任何计算工作的必备的知识。一位决心学习科学的革命干部可以从任何一本初级中学代数学的书里，专就一次方程式和一次联立方程式来自学；每星期学三小时，有四、五个星期就可能获得一些起码的数学知识了。这不是空谈，而是完全可以作到的。我不向大家推荐“数学游戏”或是“趣味的数学”一类的书，那是中学生的课外读物，可以帮助培养爱好数学的兴趣，但不能迅速有效地解决学数学的问题。
    有了代数的起码知识，就可以学习物理学和化学了。数学的对象是比较抽象的数量关系和数量变化的规律，而物理学和化学所研究的对象却要具体得多，它们是关于物质之间的关系和运动规律的科学，所以可以从生活有关的事物入手，来了解这两门科学的原理。有两种苏联科学家所写的读物，能作为学习入门之用，这两种读物都是从周围的事物出发，提升到理论上来加以说明的，它使我们能从感性认识开始，再逐步提升到理性认识的阶段。
    一本是别莱利曼著的“趣味物理学”，中文译本最近已由中国青年出版社出版。别莱利曼是苏联的博学的通俗科学读物作家，他一生有几十种著作，都受到苏联广大读者的欢迎。这本“趣味物理学”的主要目的是激发科学想像的活动，使读者由各种生活现象的说明得到物理知识。原文富于文艺性，读起来很能引人入胜，译文也流畅通顺。就学习物理学的基本知识来说，这本书可以列为启蒙读物。但是因为它过于着重于生动有趣的一面，科学名词就很少应用，完全没有算式，并且还有些和科学关系极少的故事掺杂在里面；原子物理方面的材料一点也没有，所以读完这本书之后，对于掌握极基本的物理学知识来说，还是远远不够的。
    要想得到比较勉强够用的物理学知识，还得在读完“趣味物理学”之后，拿一本初级中学程度的物理学教本，认真仔细地钻研一下。一般的初中物理学要教两年，如果我们要求革命干部系统地学习两年的物理学，那当然是不切合实际的。我想这样建议：物理学里的力学、热学和电磁学三部分对于近代工业生产的关系最大，其余的部分关系较少，一位参加工业建设的转业干部如果钻一下初中物理的这三部分，所费的时间和精力还不是太大的。粗粗地估计，每星期学习三小时，有四个月的时间是可以够了的。有了这样的基础对于进一步掌握机械和电机的知识将有极大的帮助。
    关于化学的一种启蒙读物，我想推荐鲁宾史金著的“我们周围的化学”一书。这本书在中国青年出版社和商务印书馆都有中文译本出版，译文都还畅达。这本书也是由具体现象引申到理论，比“趣味物理学”一书深一些，用了不少的元素符号和化学式子，这对于完全没有学过化学的人，读起来是费力的；可是如果能够认真读上一遍，那确实会获得相当多的基础化学知识的。
    在这里，我想应当谈一谈科学上的名词和符号问题。坦白地说：要学习科学就必须学习科学上所用的名词和符号，无论如何，这是避免不了的。打一个比方，革命理论是避免不了“社会主义”、“阶级斗争”、“剩余价值”等等名词的；没有这些名词，我们有什么办法把革命理论表达出来呢？同样的，在自然科学里，如果没有“密度”、“电阻”、
  “氧化”、“还原”等等名词，那是无法得到科学的正确概念的。斯大林在他的天才著作“马克思主义与语言学问题”一书里告诉我们：“不论人底头脑中会产生什么样的思想，以及这些思想在什么时候产生，它们只有在语言的材料底基础上、在语言的术语和词句底基础上才能产生和存在。”所以科学家深切地感觉到，要科学知识和理论在我们头脑中存在，就必须以确当的名词和符号做基础，否则是无法真正懂得科学的。这些名词和符号对于我们许多干部诚然是生疏的，但是必须把它们看成科学知识的基础来掌握。这是我们夺取科学堡垒所需要克服的最大困难之一。
    假定大家同意我的建议，从初步的代数、物理和化学三部门着手，各人就自己业余时间的具体情况，拟订一个自学计划，坚持半年，我想，到那时候，就不会看到一张蓝图而感到茫然，对着贸易订货单而踌躇无所措了。从这个基础出发，再就各人专业有关的科学知识去钻研，就不致有躐等前进的毛病，不会把精力费在劳而无功的空想上，同时也就比较有把握地能够逐步成为科学技术能手了；而在向苏联专家学习的时候，也有了更充分的条件了。
    至于一般的科学小册子和科学期刊，对于学习科学当然可以起辅助的作用，它们能够不断地用新的材料来鼓舞学习的情绪，使得我们对于科学的热爱由于经常接触这些读物而加深。可是要真正获得科学知识，除了经常性的循序渐进的、有计划的自学以外，还是很难想出其他方法来代替的。系统的自学是夺取科学堡垒的最可靠的武器。翻开“资本论”第一卷，就可以看到伟大的革命导师马克思指示我们的话，他说：“在科学上面是没有平安的大路可走的，只有那在崎岖小路的攀登上不畏劳苦的人，有希望到达光辉的顶点。”他的话是颠扑不破的真理。让我们永远记住革命导师的名言，稳扎稳打地向科学进军吧。
