The Sichuan Provincial People's Government Cultural Affairs Bureau held a provincial cultural center work symposium in late December of last year, focusing on discussing issues related to the general line propaganda and education work. Attendees believed that the content of the general line propaganda must be comprehensive and accurate in order to raise the socialist consciousness of the masses. In terms of propaganda methods, it should start from the masses' own experiences, using vivid examples familiar to the masses to explain the principles clearly; and use the method of recalling the past, comparing the present, and looking forward to the future to make the masses realize the unity of immediate and long-term interests, and realize that immediate interests must be subordinate to the long-term interests of national construction, so as to respond to the call of the Party and the government with practical actions. Therefore, it is necessary to go deep into factories and rural areas to fully understand the production, life, and ideological conditions of the workers and peasants, and vividly link the propaganda of the general line with the actual production, life, and ideology of the masses.

The meeting also listened to a report by Peng Changdeng, Deputy Director of the Provincial Cultural Affairs Bureau, on the propaganda of the general line and the work tasks for 1954. The representatives at the meeting conducted discussions in connection with their work, clearly recognizing that cultural centers and stations must mobilize all cultural propaganda organizations and propaganda tools to comprehensively, correctly, deeply, and specifically promote the national general line. At the same time, it was further clarified that propagating the national general line will be a long-term and regular task for cultural centers. From January to March 1954, cultural centers should cooperate with relevant units to conduct concentrated and prominent propaganda, and vigorously promote the general line through Spring Festival literary and artistic activities, and then shift to regular propaganda.

The meeting pointed out that the propaganda of the general line should be closely integrated with the central work of the locality. In rural areas, it should be closely integrated with agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement; in cities, especially in factories and mines, it should be combined with the increase production and practice economy movement to educate all workers and staff members on national socialist industrialization and consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, mobilizing the masses to work hard to increase production, practice strict economy, and strive to implement and realize the Party's general line and general tasks.

The meeting required the working cadres of cultural centers and stations to conscientiously study the general line and correctly and comprehensively understand the spiritual essence of the general line. Cultural centers must carefully study the guidelines and policies of the central work in each period, formulate propaganda plans under the unified leadership of the local Party and the People's Government, and implement them.

Finally, the meeting conveyed the instructions of the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government on the work of cultural centers and stations; and gave material rewards to several cultural centers that had done a better job in propaganda work.

Also Reported: In order to further improve the political and professional level of the staff of cultural centers and cultural stations, and implement the cultural and educational work policy of the Central Government, the Cultural Affairs Bureau of the Guangdong Provincial People's Government recently held a training class for cultural center directors of all counties and cities in the province. A total of 131 people participated in the study, including the directors or main staff members of 100 centers from all over the province, as well as the staff members of the cultural and educational departments of various administrative offices.

During the training period, everyone was organized to study the general line, enabling the students to realize that cultural work must be subordinate to the needs of national economic construction and must serve the general line and general tasks, and therefore it is even more necessary to further implement the cultural and educational work policy of "rectification and consolidation, key development, improving quality, and steady progress" as instructed by the Central Government, tap potential, and do more with less money. Many students deeply criticized the bourgeois ideology in the work of cultural centers. In summarizing the work, they reviewed the work and exchanged experiences; analyzed and criticized the past errors of impatience, rash advances, blind development, pursuit of formalism, paternalism, and detachment from the masses, as well as the error of decentralism.

Finally, the Provincial Cultural Bureau deployed the current work tasks of cultural centers and cultural stations, determining that the central task is to publicize the general line; each center and station, under the unified leadership and deployment of the local Party committee and the People's Government, should use various forms to carry out extensive and in-depth publicity. During the Spring Festival period, in accordance with the spirit of the "Instructions on Carrying out Spring Festival Rural Literary and Artistic Activities to Publicize the General Line to Farmers" issued by the Ministry of Culture of the Central People's Government, exhibitions, book supplies, slide shows and other methods should be used in conjunction with publicity according to different conditions in various places; cultural services such as mobile propaganda and exhibition teams can also be organized by qualified centers, and lay the foundation for amateur literary and artistic activities during the Spring Festival. Work on guiding mass literary and artistic activities during the Spring Festival should make full use of forms that people like to see and hear. In the guidance work, attention should be paid to cultivating typical examples with emphasis, gradually establishing backbones; and literary and artistic singing materials should be supplied as much as possible.

    四川省召开全省文化馆工作座谈会
    确定通过春节文艺活动大力宣传总路线
    广东省举办文化馆长训练班，布置总路线宣传工作
    四川省人民政府文化事业管理局在去年十二月下旬，召开了全省文化馆工作座谈会，着重讨论了关于总路线宣传教育工作问题。与会人员认为，在总路线宣传的内容上，必须做到全面、正确，以提高群众的社会主义觉悟。在宣传方法上，应从群众的切身体验出发，用群众所熟悉的生动事例来讲清道理；并用回忆过去，对比现在，看望将来的方法，使群众认识到眼前利益和长远利益的一致性，认识眼前的利益必须服从国家建设的长远利益，以实际行动响应党和政府的号召。因此，必须深入工厂和农村，充分了解工人、农民群众的生产、生活和思想情况，把总路线的宣传与群众的生产、生活及思想实际生动地联系起来。
    会议又听取了省文化事业管理局彭长登副局长关于宣传总路线和一九五四年工作任务的报告。到会代表联系工作进行了讨论，明确认识到文化馆、站必须动员所有的文化宣传组织和宣传工具，全面地、正确地、深入地、具体地宣传国家总路线。同时更进一步明确了宣传国家总路线将是文化馆长期的、经常的任务，在一九五四年一至三月份，文化馆应配合有关单位，集中地、突出地进行宣传，并通过春节文艺活动，大力地宣传总路线，然后再转入经常的宣传。
    会议指出：宣传总路线应该与当地的中心工作密切结合，在农村中，应密切结合农业生产和互助合作运动；在城市中，特别是在厂矿企业中，应结合增产节约运动向全体职工进行国家社会主义工业化和巩固工农联盟的教育，动员群众努力增加生产，厉行节约，为贯彻和实现党的总路线和总任务而奋斗。
    会议要求文化馆、站的工作干部认真地学习总路线，正确而全面地理解总路线的精神实质。文化馆必须仔细研究各个时期中心工作的方针、政策，在当地党和人民政府统一领导下，制订宣传计划，贯彻执行。
    会议最后传达了中央人民政府文化部对文化馆、站工作的指示；对几个宣传工作作得较好的文化馆给了物质奖励。
    又讯：广东省人民政府文化事业管理局为进一步提高文化馆和文化站工作人员的政治和业务水平，贯彻中央的文化教育工作方针，于最近举办了全省各县、市文化馆长训练班。参加学习的有全省各地一百个馆的馆长或主要工作人员，及各行署文教处的工作人员等共一百三十一人。
    在训练期间，组织大家学习了总路线，使学员们认识到文化工作必须服从国家经济建设的需要，必须为总路线、总任务服务，因而更需要进一步贯彻中央指示的“整顿巩固、重点发展、提高质量、稳步前进”的文教工作方针，发挥潜力，用少量的钱，办更多的事。许多学员深入地批判了在文化馆工作中的资产阶级思想。在总结工作中，检查了工作，交流了经验；分析、批判了过去工作上的急躁冒进、盲目发展、追求形式、包办代替、脱离群众等错误倾向和分散主义的错误。
    最后，省文化局布置了文化馆、文化站当前的工作任务，确定以宣传总路线为中心工作；各馆、站在各地党委和人民政府的统一领导与布置之下，运用各种形式，进行广泛、深入的宣传。春节期内，应依照中央人民政府文化部“关于开展春节农村文艺活动向农民宣传总路线的指示”的精神，按照各地不同的条件，运用展览会、图书供应、幻灯放映等方式配合宣传；有条件的馆还可组织流动宣传、展览队等进行文化服务工作，并为春节业余文艺活动打下基础。春节期间进行辅导群众文艺活动的工作，充分利用人民喜见乐闻的形式。在辅导工作中应注意有重点地培养典型，逐步建立骨干；并尽可能供应文娱演唱材料。
