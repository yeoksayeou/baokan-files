Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, January 9th: Appendix Nine of the "Temporary Report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" contains correspondence between the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and our side and the US side regarding the extension of the interpretation period. This shows that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission had already decided, early in its work, that the loss of interpretation days should be compensated for, and the ninety-day interpretation period should be made up.
	Due to obstruction and sabotage by the US side, the interpretation work could not begin on the originally scheduled date of September 26th of last year. On September 24th of last year, Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, sent separate memoranda to our side and the US side, requesting that the interpretation period be postponed and extended by five days. The memorandum stated: The interpretation work cannot begin on September 26, 1953. "Thus, the Committee must request both commands to agree to postpone the commencement of explanations and interviews for a period not exceeding five days. The Committee sincerely hopes that your Command will agree to this extension, thereby extending the period stipulated in paragraph 8 of the Terms of Reference by five days."
	However, the US side deliberately sabotaged the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," depriving the Korean and Chinese side of the legitimate right to conduct ninety days of explanations to the prisoners of war. Hamblen, the head of the US side's so-called "Repatriation" group, replied to Thimayya on September 25th of last year, unreasonably refusing to extend the interpretation period by five days. Thimayya wrote to Hamblen again on September 28th of last year, explaining the reasons why the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission requested an extension of the interpretation period, and requesting the US side to agree to the Commission's decision to extend the interpretation period. The letter stated: "The Committee decided at its meeting on September 27th that I should write to you again to inquire whether you would be willing to reconsider your decision after I have explained the following points: (1) The Committee feels that it must provide both parties with facilities for dispatching explaining representatives and allowing them to enter and leave for the entire ninety-day period. (2) Postponing the start of the explaining work will shorten the ninety-day period. (3) It is very likely that the explaining work will end within the shortened period, but if it cannot be ended, this reduction will be disadvantageous to the party that has more prisoners of war to explain to."

### “中立国遣返委员会临时报告”附件九表明  中立国遣返委员会早已决定顺延解释期限

    “中立国遣返委员会临时报告”附件九表明
    中立国遣返委员会早已决定顺延解释期限
    【新华社平壤九日电】“中立国遣返委员会临时报告”附件九所载的中立国遣返委员会和我方及美方之间关于延长解释期限的来往信件说明：中立国遣返委员会早在其进行工作的初期就已作出了解释日期的损失应予顺延、九十天的解释期限应予补足的决定。
    由于美方的阻挠和破坏，解释工作不能在原定的去年九月二十六日开始。在去年九月二十四日，中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将分别向我方和美方提出备忘录一件，要求把解释期限推迟并顺延五天。备忘录说：解释工作不可能在一九五三年九月二十六日开始。“这样，本委员会就不得不要求双方司令部同意将解释与访问的开始推延不超过五天的时期。本委员会衷心希望你方司令部能同意这一延期，从而将职权范围第八款中所规定的期限顺延五天。”
    但是，美方蓄意破坏“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”，剥夺朝中方面对战俘进行九十天解释的合法权利。美方所谓“遣返”组组长汉布伦在去年九月二十五日复信给蒂迈雅，蛮横无理地拒绝把解释期限顺延五天。蒂迈雅又在去年九月二十八日写信给汉布伦，说明中立国遣返委员会要求顺延解释期限的理由，要求美方同意委员会顺延解释期限的决定。信件说：“本委员会在九月二十七日的会议上决定，由我再度写信询问在我把以下各点说明之后你是否愿意重新考虑你的决定：（1）本委员会觉得它必须在整整九十天的期限内给予双方以便利来派遣解释代表，并准许他们出入。（2）延期开始解释工作将缩短九十天的期限。（3）很有可能解释工作会在缩短了的期限内结束，但是如果不能结束，则此缩减对拥有较多需要解释的战俘的一方不利。”
