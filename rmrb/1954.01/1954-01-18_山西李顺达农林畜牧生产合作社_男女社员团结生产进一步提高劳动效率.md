The Li Shunda Agricultural, Forestry, and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, saw male and female members unite in production to further improve labor efficiency in 1953.

　　In order to further improve agricultural production, develop forestry and animal husbandry, and carry out basic agricultural construction, the Li Shunda Cooperative included all female labor in the contracted work and production plan at the beginning of 1953. In making the plan, it implemented a rational division of labor according to the characteristics of women. In the spring, male members repaired beaches, built dikes, carried fertilizer, and plowed the land, while women harrowed the land, repaired field edges and embankments, applied fertilizer, planted seeds, and planted trees for afforestation. In the summer, male members continued to complete the work of building dams, smashing mountain gullies, and building stone pools, while women carried out seedling pulling and hoeing. Men and women worked together for the second hoeing and topdressing. The third hoeing was done by male members, while women carried out荒山播种 (荒山播种 is not a standard expression, but could mean sowing seeds on barren hills). Later, when cutting artemisia to accumulate fertilizer, a division of labor was implemented with women cutting artemisia and men bundling and carrying it. Male members also simultaneously cultivated the land and smoked stubble fertilizer. In 1953, 50% of the land in the cooperative was harrowed by women. They also pulled more than 80 mu of millet, more than 100 mu of corn, hoeed 152 mu of seedlings, and the whole cooperative cut 70,000 jin of artemisia, of which 20,000 jin were cut by women. Women's active participation in agricultural labor not only ensured the smooth completion of the cooperative's agricultural production increase plan, but also freed up male labor to build an earth dam, repair six mu of beaches and three reservoirs, and earn 7.2 million yuan from sideline production.

　　The Li Shunda Cooperative's method of implementing rational division of labor and contracted work for men and women enabled 18 women in the cooperative to regularly participate in production and receive reasonable remuneration. In 1953, female members earned a total of 1,658 workdays, accounting for more than 34% of the cooperative's agricultural workdays, and their income accounted for the same proportion.

　　Due to women's active production, a social atmosphere of respecting women's labor and united production between men and women has been established in the cooperative. Shen Jilan's family held monthly family meetings, and she was always consulted on matters in the family. Ma Junzao's family had five people, he and his wife Zhang Zhiyu worked on the land, and his mother took care of the children, cooked, and fed the livestock at home. Ma Junzao's mother often praised Zhang Zhiyu's good labor, and she treated her son and daughter-in-law equally, and treated them the same in terms of food and clothing. In addition, the eleven families of Lü Guilan and others have also become new-style families that are democratic, harmonious, and united in production. Male members are increasingly aware that women's participation in production can make the cooperative's production better and everyone's income higher; women have also gradually established the concept of being masters of the cooperative and working together with men. Last year, male and female members launched a movement of men teaching women and mutual teaching and learning technology, which has achieved great results. Now, every woman has learned to plow, and 21 women have learned harrowing and hoeing techniques. Because of the improvement of women's skills, last year 15 women increased their income from six work points a day to eight to ten points. In the autumn, Wang Zhaogen and other seven elderly women who cut millet ears in the field also received ten to twelve work points. At the summary and evaluation meeting in the autumn, the women said: "We have learned to do everything in the past year, thanks to the men teaching us." The men said: "Teaching you the techniques is equivalent to producing more grain, which is beneficial to everyone." "The completion of the plan this year depends entirely on the participation of women in labor!"

　　Women who have made outstanding achievements in labor have participated in government work and cooperative management. Deputy Director Shen Jilan is the chairman of the township women's federation, a member of the county people's government, and an executive member of the All-China Democratic Women's Federation. Han Chunlan, who has made outstanding achievements in labor, has also been elected as deputy township head. In addition, four other women were elected as cadres of the cooperative and participated in the cooperative's management work.

    山西李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社
    男女社员团结生产进一步提高劳动效率
    一九五三年，山西省平顺县李顺达农林畜牧生产合作社，男女社员团结生产，进一步提高劳动效率。
    李顺达社为了进一步提高农业生产，并发展林业、牧业和进行农业基本建设，一九五三年一开头，该社就把妇女劳力都列入包工包产计划之内，并在作计划时就按照妇女特点，实行了合理分工。春季，男社员修滩地，垒堤坝，担肥，犁地，妇女就耢耙土地，修理地头、边堰，拨肥点籽，植树造林；夏季，男社员继续完成垒坝，砸山沟，修石池的工作，妇女就进行拔苗，锄头遍苗的工作；到锄二遍苗和上追肥时，男女共同进行；第三遍苗由男社员锄，妇女则进行了荒山播种的工作；以后，到割蒿积肥时，又实行女割蒿、男捆搬的分工，男社员并同时耕地、熏茬肥。该社一九五三年有百分之五十的土地是妇女耢耙的。她们还拔谷子八十多亩，拔玉米一百多亩，锄苗一百五十二亩，全社割蒿七万斤，其中妇女割的就有两万斤。妇女积极参加农业劳动，不但保证了全社农业增产计划的顺利完成，而且腾出男劳力打了一条土坝，修了六亩滩地和三个蓄水池，并从副业生产中赚了七百二十万元。
    李顺达社实行男女合理分工包工的办法，使全社有十八个妇女都能经常参加生产，并且得到了合理的报酬。女社员一九五三年共得了一千六百五十八个劳动日，占全社农业劳动日的百分之三十四多，她们的收入也占同样的比例。
    由于妇女积极生产，社里已经树立了尊重妇女劳动，男女团结生产的风气。申纪兰家月月都要开家庭会，家里有事总和她商量；马俊枣家共五口人，他和妻子张芝玉上地劳动，母亲在家看孩子、做饭和喂牲口，马俊枣的母亲常常夸奖张芝玉的好劳动，她对儿子媳妇一样亲，吃穿都一样看待；此外，吕贵兰等十一家也都成了这样民主和睦、团结生产的新型家庭。男社员越来越认识到妇女参加生产，才能使社里的生产搞得更好，大家收入更多；妇女也渐渐树立了和男人团结办社的主人翁思想。男女社员去年开展了男教女学和互教互学技术的运动，收到了很大效果。现在，每个妇女都已学会犁地，二十一个妇女学会耢耙地和锄苗等技术。因为妇女技术的提高，去年有十五个妇女由一天得六分工提高到八分至十分了，秋天在场里切谷穗的王招根等七个老年妇女，也得到了十分工到十二分工。秋季在总结评比大会上，妇女们都说：“一年来什么活都学会做啦，这全靠男人教我们哩。”男人们却说：“教会你们技术就等于多打粮食啦，对谁都有利”“一年来全凭妇女参加劳动才完成了计划呀！”
    在劳动上有卓越成就的妇女都参加了政府工作和社务管理工作。副社长申纪兰是乡妇女主席，县人民政府的委员和全国民主妇联执行委员；在劳动中有卓越成就的韩春兰也被选为副乡长。此外，还有四名妇女当选了合作社的干部，参加了合作社的社务管理工作。
