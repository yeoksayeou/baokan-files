Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 6th -- With the rapid progress of post-war reconstruction and substantial assistance from fraternal countries, the lives of the broad masses of people in northern Korea are improving.

Since the armistice, banks in various parts of northern Korea have provided large loans to workers, farmers, and families of military personnel to build homes and develop production. People who lived in dugouts during the war have moved into newly built houses. Workers and staff in various regions have generally received large quantities of winter supplies distributed by the government, such as coal, cotton cloth, cotton clothing, blankets, food, fish, and oil. Farmers in various regions have also received cotton cloth distributed by the government. After the government's commercial departments reduced prices of essential commodities three times in 1953, the prices of dozens of items have been reduced by more than 50 percent, and market prices have also fallen. The purchasing power of the working people has significantly increased. For example, the sales volume of twelve state-owned stores in Sinuiju in November and December of 1953 increased by an average of one-fold per month compared to the sales volume from July to October of the same year. The sales volume of the state-owned department store in Wonsan in December of 1953 also increased by 50 percent compared to November of the same year.

In order to meet the needs of the people's cultural life, theaters, cinemas, cultural clubs, and libraries are being actively built in various places. In South Pyongan Province alone, eleven theaters and cinemas, and more than two thousand democratic propaganda rooms and cultural clubs have now been restored.

    朝鲜北部物价降低广大人民生活逐渐改善
    【新华社平壤六日电】随着战后恢复建设事业的迅速进展及各兄弟国家的大量援助，朝鲜北部广大人民的生活正在改善。
    停战以后，朝鲜北部各地银行大量贷款给工人、农民及军人家属修建住宅和发展生产。战时住在土窟里的人们已搬进新建的房屋，各地工人和职员普遍得到了政府配给的煤、棉布、棉衣、毯子及食品、鱼类、油类等大量的过冬物品。各地农民也得到了政府配给的棉布。政府的商业部门在一九五三年对主要的生活必需品三次减低价格以后，有数十种物品的价格降低了百分之五十以上，市场的物价也随着降低。劳动人民的购买力有了显著的提高。如新义州市的十二个国营商店在一九五三年十一、十二两个月的销售量，比同年七月到十月的销售量平均每月增加了一倍。元山市的国营百货商店在一九五三年十二月份的销售量，也比同年十一月份增加了百分之五十。
    为了满足人民文化生活的需要，各地并积极修建剧场、电影院、文化俱乐部和图书馆。只在平安南道，现在就已修复十一所剧场、电影院，和两千多处民主宣传室、文化俱乐部。
