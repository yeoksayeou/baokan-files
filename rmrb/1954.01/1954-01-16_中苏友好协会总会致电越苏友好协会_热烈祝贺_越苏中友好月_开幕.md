Xinhua News Agency, January 15th: The Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters, Qian Junrui, sent a telegram to Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Association, congratulating the opening of the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month. The telegram reads as follows: To Comrade Ton Duc Thang, Chairman of the Vietnam-Soviet Friendship Association, and to the Central Organizing Committee of the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month,

    On the occasion of the opening of the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month, please accept our warm congratulations on behalf of all members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association. We wish the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month a complete success.

    The Chinese people deeply care about the heroic struggle waged by the Vietnamese people and are immensely delighted by the glorious victories achieved by the Vietnamese people. Every victory achieved by the Vietnamese people in the liberation war against imperialist aggression and for national independence is a heavy blow to the international aggressive bloc and a major contribution to the cause of defending world peace.

    The victory of the great October Socialist Revolution and the existence of the great Soviet Union, along with its brilliant achievements in socialist and communist construction, serve as a lighthouse guiding humanity forward and inspiring the oppressed people to struggle for freedom, independence, and happiness. The Chinese people firmly believe that, under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party and President Ho Chi Minh, the great and just cause of the Vietnamese people in striving for national independence and defending world peace will surely achieve final victory, and the conspiracy of French and American imperialism to expand the war of aggression will surely meet with shameful failure.

    To further develop and consolidate the eternal friendship with the great Soviet people, to learn from the revolutionary struggle and construction experience of the Soviet people, and to further strengthen friendship with the people of all people's democratic countries and peace-loving people around the world are important guarantees for oppressed people to achieve victory and consolidate victory. It is of great significance that the Vietnamese people are holding the Vietnam-Soviet-China Friendship Month today on the basis of the victory of the eight-year war of resistance. Through this Friendship Month movement, the friendship and solidarity of the people of the Soviet Union, Vietnam, and China will surely be further strengthened and consolidated.

    Long live the eternal friendship of the people of the Soviet Union, Vietnam, and China!
    Long live the independence and unification of Vietnam!
    Long live Chairman Malenkov!
    Long live Chairman Ho Chi Minh!
    Long live Chairman Mao Zedong!
          Qian Junrui, Secretary-General of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Association Headquarters
                    January 15, 1954

    值兹越苏中友好月开幕之际，谨代表中苏友好协会全体会员，表示热烈的祝贺。祝贺越苏中友好月胜利成功。
    中国人民对于越南人民进行的英勇斗争寄予深刻的关怀，对于越南人民所获得的光辉胜利，感到无比的欢欣。越南人民在为反对帝国主义侵略、争取民族独立的解放战争中所获得的每一个胜利，都是对于国际侵略集团的沉重打击，是对于保卫世界和平事业的重大贡献。
    伟大的十月社会主义革命的胜利和伟大的苏联的存在及其社会主义和共产主义建设的辉煌成就，像灯塔一样，指引着人类前进的道路，鼓舞着被压迫人民为争取自由、独立和幸福的斗争。中国人民深信，越南人民在越南劳动党和胡志明主席的领导下，为争取民族独立，为保卫世界和平而进行的伟大的正义事业将一定得到最后的胜利，法、美帝国主义企图扩大侵略战争的阴谋将一定遭到可耻的失败。
    进一步发展和巩固对伟大的苏联人民的永恒友谊，学习苏联人民的革命斗争和建设的经验，进一步加强与各人民民主国家人民及全世界爱好和平人民的友谊是被压迫人民取得胜利和巩固胜利的重要保证。越南人民今天在八年抗战的胜利基础上来举行越苏中友好月具有重大的意义，通过这次友好月运动，苏越中三国人民的友谊与团结必将获得进一步的加强和巩固。
    苏越中三国人民的永恒友谊万岁！
    越南独立和统一万岁！
    马林科夫主席万岁！
    胡志明主席万岁！
    毛泽东主席万岁！
