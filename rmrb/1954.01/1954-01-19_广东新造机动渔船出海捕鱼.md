    The first batch of new-style motor fishing boats manufactured by the Guangdong Provincial Aquatic Products Enterprise Company Fishing Boat Repair and Manufacturing Plant have gone out to sea and caught many valuable fish that old-style fishing boats could not catch. Among them are tuna and sailfish weighing hundreds of kilograms, as well as whales and large thresher sharks with significant economic value.

    This batch of newly built motor fishing boats consists of four vessels, which set sail for the first time on December 19th of last year and have now returned victoriously. Among them, two are 103-ton double-rig trawlers, one is a 123-ton single-rig trawler, and one is an 88-ton fishing boat. These motor fishing boats use machines for all operations from casting anchor, lowering nets to raising nets (needles). They can cast nets four to six times a day (old-style fishing boats can only cast nets once a day). The boats are equipped with electric lights, so they can fish at night. Each boat is also equipped with a radio receiver, radio telephone, refrigeration equipment, a dining room, and a club. When work stops, during calm days when the sea is calm and the netting work is not busy, the crew members sit on the deck reading books and magazines, or playing chess in the club. Although they are sailing far away on the motherland's oceans, they can listen to broadcasts from Beijing and Guangzhou at any time and place.

    This fishing trip has enhanced the understanding of fishery mechanization for many crew members from fishing families. Li Rong, an old fisherman, said: "Before going to sea, I still had the idea that fishermen must rely on the heavens for food. After returning from this trip, this idea has been dispelled. Fishery mechanization not only makes fishing independent of wind power, allowing for production throughout the year, but also ensures safety." When the motor fishing boats passed through the fishing ports along the western Guangdong coast, local fishermen enthusiastically visited and said happily to the crew members: "We want to follow you and install machines on everyone's fishing boats for fishing."

### 广东新造机动渔船出海捕鱼

    广东新造机动渔船出海捕鱼
    广东省水产企业公司渔轮修造厂制造的第一批新式机动渔船，已出海捕获了许多旧式渔船不能捕到的贵重鱼类。其中有几百斤重的金枪鱼和旗鱼，还有经济价值较大的鲸鱼和大长尾鲨鱼。
    这批新造的机动渔船共有四艘，它们在去年十二月十九日首次远航出海捕鱼，现已胜利回来。其中有两艘是载重一百零三吨的双式拖船，一艘是一百二十三吨的单式拖船，一艘是八十八吨的钓船。这些机动渔船从起锚、下网到起网（针）全部用机器操作，每天可以下网四次到六次（旧式渔船每天只能下网一次）。船上设有电光照明灯，夜里一样可以捕鱼。每艘船上还设有无线电收报机、无线电话、冷藏装置、餐室和俱乐部。在停止作业的时候，在风平浪静的白天下了网工作不忙的时候，船员们就坐在甲板上看书看画报，或者在俱乐部里下棋。他们虽然远航在祖国的海洋上，但随时随地都可以收听北京和广州的广播。
    这次出海捕鱼，使许多渔民出身的船员提高了渔业机械化的认识。老渔工出身的黎容说：“出海前，我还存在着渔民一定得靠天吃饭的思想，经过这次出海回来，这种思想才打消了。渔业机械化不但使捕鱼不受风力的限制，全年都可以生产，而且安全也有保障。”机动渔船经过粤西沿海各渔港的时候，当地渔民都热烈前往参观，高兴地对船员说：“我们要跟着你们走，叫大家的渔船都能安上机器来捕鱼。”　（新华社）
