    Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, January 21st: Indian public opinion is expressing serious concern about the evolution of the Korean situation and condemning the American plot to undermine the authority of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and forcibly detain prisoners of war.

    The "Free Press" wrote in an editorial on January 19th: "General Thimayya, representing the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, has very clearly issued the warning that any unilateral action taken by the American authorities against prisoners of war without the consent of the Korean-Chinese Command or before the completion of the explanatory work and the holding of a political conference can only mean a violation of the armistice agreement. However, this warning cannot conceal the criminal act of handing over 22,000 prisoners of war to Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek as cannon fodder by the American warmongers. There are many other examples of the American authorities using means to undermine peace, but the prisoner of war issue in the Korean War once again shows the shameless depths to which the American authorities have sunk."

    The editorial continued: The American authorities interrupted the preliminary talks for the Korean political conference and unreasonably insisted on the removal of certain words, making it impossible for the negotiations to resume. At the same time, at the request of the Indian government, the member states of the United Nations have been consulted on the convening of the United Nations General Assembly; however, this has also met with the opposition of the American authorities.

    The editorial said: "The United States is blocking all avenues for a solution. The United Nations General Assembly meeting, the political conference, and the repatriation of prisoners of war—the United States is determined to destroy all of these. And it is at this time that the Indian authorities decided to hand over the prisoners of war: in effect, they paved the way for the seizure. And the Indian authorities have no right to make this decision. Changing the current custody of prisoners of war before the completion of the explanatory work and the convening of a political conference would also be an act in violation of the armistice agreement."

    The "New Age" wrote in an editorial on January 17th: "The various developments in Korea show that India has not done all it could in Korea. For example, the United States and Syngman Rhee have extensive spy and secret agent networks in the prisoner of war camps. These agents even hesitate to murder prisoners of war who express their desire to return to their homeland. The Indian custodial forces have not taken any action against these agents merely because the representatives of Switzerland and Sweden opposed it. If the Indian custodial forces took any action to purge these agents and spies in the prisoner of war camps, world opinion would support it."

    The editorial pointed out: "On the one hand, the United States and its vassal states are formulating plans to seize more than 20,000 North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and turn them into cannon fodder; on the other hand, they are talking about a United Nations General Assembly meeting to confuse the people's vision. They hope to confuse the people's vision in order to realize their despicable plans."

    The editorial said: "The United States is once again playing a dangerous game. The United States is plotting new conspiracies every day in order to deceive the people of the world. Only a few weeks ago, when the United Nations General Assembly was still in session, the United States held preliminary talks with China and North Korea on a Korean political conference. But as soon as the United Nations General Assembly ended, the United States immediately interrupted these negotiations. The current danger is that at the next meeting of the United Nations General Assembly, the United States will again try to delay discussion of this issue, while after 'releasing' the North Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, the United States will try to send them to Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee's armies as cannon fodder."

### 印度报纸谴责美方破坏停战协定劫夺战俘

    印度报纸谴责美方破坏停战协定劫夺战俘
    【新华社新德里二十一日电】印度舆论对朝鲜形势的演变表示严重的关切，并且谴责美国破坏中立国遣返委员会职权范围强迫扣留战俘的阴谋。
    “自由报”在一月十九日的社论中写道：“蒂迈雅将军代表中立国遣返委员会已经很清楚地宣布了这样的警告：不经朝中司令部的同意或在解释工作完成及政治会议举行之前，美国当局对战俘所采取的任何片面行动，只能意味着破坏停战协定。但是，这种警告掩盖不了把二万二千名战俘通过美国战争贩子移交给李承晚和蒋介石作炮灰的罪恶行动。另外还有许多关于美国当局使用手段来破坏和平的例子，可是，在有关朝鲜战争的战俘问题上又一次表明美国当局堕落到怎样的无耻境地。”
    社论接着指出：美国当局中断了朝鲜政治会议预备会谈，并且无理地坚持要求撤销某些话，以致使谈判无法恢复。同时，由于印度政府的要求，联合国各会员国已被征询关于召开联合国大会的意见；可是这也遇到美国当局的反对。
    社论说：“美国阻挡了一切谋求解决的途径。联合国大会会议、政治会议以及战俘的遣返——美国决心要破坏这一切。而正是在这种时候，印度当局决定要把战俘交给他们：实际上，他们是为劫夺一举铺平了道路。而印度当局是无权作出这种决定的。在完成解释工作和召开政治会议之前改变战俘目前的看管情况，那也将是违背停战协定的行动。”
    “新世纪报”一月十七日的社论中写道：“朝鲜的种种发展显示：印度并没有在朝鲜作到它所能作的一切。例如，美国和李承晚在战俘营中设有广大的间谍与特务网。这些特务甚至竟毫不犹豫地谋杀那些表示希望返回自己祖国去的战俘。印度看管部队仅仅因为瑞士和瑞典的代表们反对而没有对这些特务们采取任何行动。如果印度看管部队采取任何肃清战俘营中的这种特务与间谍的行动，那么，全世界的舆论将会支持它的。”
    社论指出：“一方面，美国和它的附庸国家正在制订计划要劫夺二万余名北朝鲜战俘和中国战俘，使他们成为战争炮灰；另一方面，他们在谈着联合国大会会议，以迷惑人民的视线。他们希望迷惑人民的视线，从而实现他们的卑鄙计划。”
    社论说：“美国又一次在玩着危险的把戏。美国每天在策划新阴谋。以便欺骗世界人民。仅在几星期前，当联合国大会还在开会的时候，美国与中国和北朝鲜进行了关于朝鲜政治会议的预备会谈。但是一当联合国大会结束，美国马上就中断了这种谈判。现在的危险是，在联合国大会下一次会议时，美国将再度设法延迟讨论这个问题，同时在‘释放了’北朝鲜战俘和中国战俘后，美国将设法把他们送给蒋介石和李承晚军队当炮灰。”
