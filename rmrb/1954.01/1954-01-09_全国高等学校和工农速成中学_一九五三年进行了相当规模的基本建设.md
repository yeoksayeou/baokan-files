To ensure the smooth progress of the state's plan to cultivate talent for construction, national higher education institutions (excluding higher normal schools) and worker-peasant short-course middle schools undertook basic construction work on a considerable scale in 1953. The total construction area for the year reached 1.33 million square meters, with a total state investment of over 2.1 trillion yuan, equivalent to the value of building ten new cotton mills with 50,000 spindles each. Such a large construction scale in higher education institutions is unprecedented in the history of modern schools in China. The construction volume in the past year was equivalent to 34.1 percent of the total construction area of higher education institutions in old China over fifty years.

Last year, 103 higher education institutions and worker-peasant short-course middle schools in 30 cities across the country built new or expanded school buildings. Construction projects focused on engineering, with the total construction area of higher industrial schools accounting for approximately 720,000 square meters, or more than 54.1 percent of the total construction area. At the same time, the teaching needs of comprehensive universities and higher education institutions in agriculture and forestry, medicine, finance and economics, political science and law, language, art, and physical education were also appropriately met. These schools built a number of new school buildings in proportion. Last year, twenty higher education institutions including Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, Beijing Petroleum Institute, Beijing Institute of Geology, Beijing Institute of Mining, Beijing Institute of Agricultural Mechanization, Harbin Medical University, and Huazhong Institute of Technology had completely new school buildings. Eighty-three colleges and universities, including Peking University, Tianjin University, Harbin Institute of Technology, Zhejiang University, Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy, Chongqing University, Sichuan University, Yunnan University, and Northwest University, expanded on the basis of existing school buildings. Last year, the central government issued basic construction tasks to various schools relatively late, but schools in various regions generally received strong support from relevant departments such as architectural engineering design, construction, and transportation under the leadership of local Party committees and people's governments. They started construction on schedule and accelerated the progress of the projects. Many schools completed three- or four-story teaching buildings in 1953. According to inspections by the Ministry of Higher Education of the Central People's Government in Beijing, Tianjin, Northeast, East China, Central South, and Southwest regions, the school building construction tasks for the year were generally 88 percent completed, with Beijing and Tianjin completing 90 percent, the Northeast region completing 95 percent, the East China region completing 81 percent, the Central South region completing 73 percent, the Southwest region completing 75 percent, the Northwest completing 90 percent, and the Inner Mongolia region completing all tasks. Many schools also paid attention to saving and saved a lot of funds for the state. For example, the teachers' residences of Harbin Foreign Language College, the student dormitories of Northeast People's University, the practice factory of Dalian Institute of Technology, and the school buildings of Beijing Institute of Agricultural Mechanization, Tianjin University, former Central University of Finance and Economics, Tongji University, and Central South Institute of Mining and Metallurgy were all completed well under the principle of frugality. Among them, Beijing Institute of Agricultural Mechanization built 19,454 square meters of school buildings last year. In addition to completing the project on schedule and ensuring the quality of the project, it also saved more than 8 billion yuan for the state. With approval, the school used 4 billion yuan of this amount to build a "Frugality Building" to meet the needs of the affiliated worker-peasant short-course middle school for enrollment in 1954.

However, there were still relatively serious waste phenomena in the basic construction work of national higher education institutions and worker-peasant short-course middle schools in 1953, resulting in a large overrun of construction project funds. According to preliminary statistics, the construction funds of higher education institutions across the country exceeded approximately 208 billion yuan, accounting for 9.8 percent of the total basic construction investment. Among them, schools with relatively large overruns include Harbin Medical University, Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Technology, Beijing Institute of Geology, Peking University, and Huazhong Institute of Technology. The schools that overspent funds first required higher and larger designs. Some schools had overly large campus designs, scattered buildings, and excessive costs for outdoor projects such as water, electricity, heating, and sanitation. The building design standards were also too high, and the decoration projects were overly exquisite. For example, Beijing Institute of Aeronautics used too much reinforced concrete structure in the construction project, as well as high-grade materials and equipment such as washed stone walls, hot air blowers, and floor spring doors. Some schools also used expensive materials such as underground cables and glazed tile roofs. Last year, due to the late issuance of tasks and weak design strength in the basic construction of higher education institutions and worker-peasant short-course middle schools, 12 percent of the construction projects needed to be carried over to the next year, which directly affected the adjustment of departments in higher education institutions and the guarantee of teaching needs. The Ministry of Higher Education of the Central Government is now summarizing basic construction work and consulting with relevant agencies to issue the basic construction tasks for 1954 as early as possible, so as to design and prepare materials in a timely manner, strengthen and improve the leadership of basic construction work, and strive to complete the basic construction tasks for 1954 on schedule.

    全国高等学校和工农速成中学
    一九五三年进行了相当规模的基本建设
    为了保证国家培养建设人材计划的顺利进行，一九五三年全国高等学校（高等师范学校不计算在内）和工农速成中学进行了相当规模的基本建设工作。全年建筑面积达一百三十三万平方公尺，国家共投资二万一千余亿元，相当于新建十个五万纱锭纱厂的价值。高等学校这样宏大的建筑规模，是中国历史上兴办现代学校以来从来没有过的，去年一年的建筑工程量相当于旧中国高等学校五十年建筑面积总和的百分之三十四点一。
    去年全国有三十个城市一百零三所高等学校和工农速成中学新建和扩建了校舍，建筑工程以工科为重点，高等工业学校建筑总面积约七十二万平方公尺，占建筑总面积百分之五十四点一强；同时也适当地满足了综合大学、农林、医药、财经、政法、语文、艺术、体育等科高等学校的教学需要。这些学校都按一定比例建筑了不少新校舍。去年完全新建校舍的有北京钢铁学院、北京航空学院、北京石油学院、北京地质学院、北京矿业学院、北京农业机械化学院、哈尔滨医科大学、华中工学院等二十所高等学校。在原有校舍基础上扩建的有北京大学、天津大学、哈尔滨工业大学、浙江大学、中南矿冶学院、重庆大学、四川大学、云南大学、西北大学等八十三院校。去年中央下达各校基本建设任务较迟，但各地学校一般都在当地党委和人民政府领导下，得到建筑工程设计、施工和交通运输等有关部门的大力支持，都已按期开工，并加速工程进度；不少学校的三四层教学大楼都已在一九五三年内完工。据中央人民政府高等教育部在北京、天津、东北、华东、中南、西南等地区检查，全年校舍建筑任务大致已完成百分之八十八，其中北京、天津地区完成百分之九十，东北区完成百分之九十五，华东区完成百分之八十一，中南区完成百分之七十三，西南区完成百分之七十五，西北完成百分之九十，内蒙区全部完成。许多学校并注意节约，为国家节省了大量经费。如哈尔滨外国语专科学校的教师住宅，东北人民大学的学生宿舍，大连工学院的实习工厂，北京农业机械化学院、天津大学、原中央财经学院、同济大学、中南矿冶学院等校校舍，都在节约的原则下完成得较好。其中北京农业机械化学院去年共建筑一万九千四百五十四平方公尺的校舍，除按期完成保证工程质量外，并为国家节省了八十多亿元。该校经批准将其中四十亿元修建了一座“节约大楼”，以满足该校附设工农速成中学一九五四年招生的需要。
    但是，一九五三年全国高等学校和工农速成中学基本建设工作中还存在着比较严重的浪费现象，以致建筑工程超支经费很大。据初步统计，全国高等学校建筑经费共约超支二千零八十亿元，占基本建设总投资百分之九点八。其中超支经费较多的学校有哈尔滨医科大学、北京航空学院、北京钢铁学院、北京地质学院、北京大学和华中工学院等院校。超支经费的学校首先在设计上要求偏高偏大，有些学校校园设计太大，房屋分散，水、电、暖气和卫生等室外工程费用过大，建筑设计标准也过高，装饰工程过于讲究。如北京航空学院建筑工程过多采用钢筋混凝土结构，水刷石墙面和热吹风、地弹簧门等高级材料及设备。还有些学校用地下电缆和琉璃瓦房顶等贵重器材。去年高等学校和工农速成中学基本建设由于任务下达迟和设计力量薄弱等原因，还有百分之十二的建筑工程需要跨年度，这就直接影响到高等学校院系调整和保证教学需要。中央高等教育部现正总结基本建设工作，并和有关机关协商，尽量使一九五四年基本建设任务早日下达，以便及时设计备料，加强和改善对基本建设工作的领导，争取按期完成一九五四年的基本建设任务。
