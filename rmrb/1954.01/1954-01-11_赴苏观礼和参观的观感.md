Impressions of Attending the Soviet Celebration and Visiting
Xu Guangping, Head of the Chinese Women's Delegation

At the invitation of the Soviet Women's Anti-Fascist Committee, the All-China Democratic Women's Federation sent a 20-member delegation to Moscow in 1953 to participate in the grand celebrations of the 36th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution and had the good opportunity to visit and study in the Soviet Union for 28 days. This visit combined our past impressions of the great socialist country from books and newspapers with the vivid and concrete facts we saw with our own eyes. It allowed us to further understand the superiority of the socialist system, the Soviet people's infinite loyalty to the cause of peace, their great spirit of self-sacrifice in building their socialist homeland, and their happy lives. It also enabled us to more deeply appreciate the profound friendship of the Soviet people towards the Chinese people. All of our delegation members felt that they had received a profound education in communism and internationalism.

The various factories and collective farms we saw in the Soviet Union fully demonstrated that their production was indeed based on a high level of technology. At the Stalin Automobile Factory, we saw with our own eyes a complete and flawless car being produced every three to five minutes. At the Karl Marx Sugar Factory, 120 tons of various delicious candies could be produced every day. In the knitting and tea factories of the Georgian Republic, the machines we saw were all fully automated. The degree of mechanization and electrification of Soviet agriculture is also unmatched by any capitalist country. At the Inkiri State Tea Farm, we saw a tea-picking machine that could pick 100 kilograms of tea per hour. All the labor-intensive work on the collective farm is done by machines.

The progress of production technology and the growth of industrial production go hand in hand. Under the wise leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and Comrades Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet people implemented the policy of socialist industrialization. The speed of Soviet socialist industrialization is astonishing. Compared with 1913, the industry of the Russian Federation increased twelvefold in 1940, the industry of the Tajik Republic increased 277-fold, the industry of the Georgian Republic increased 26-fold, and the industry of Armenia increased 23-fold. While great achievements have been made in the comprehensive development of heavy industry, the production of daily necessities in the Soviet Union has also increased approximately twelvefold in the past 28 years. The Soviet Communist Party and the government care about the welfare of the people. On the basis of continuing to develop heavy industry and the victories already achieved in heavy industry, they have now put forward measures to vigorously develop light industry, the food industry, and agriculture, so as to continuously meet the needs of the people as their purchasing power increases.

The great achievements of Soviet socialist construction should be attributed to the leadership of the Soviet Communist Party and the selfless and creative labor of all Soviet people. Here, I would like to especially mention women, who are a huge force in socialist construction. Women work in all sectors of the Soviet Union. Taking the Ukrainian Republic as an example, women account for an average of 48 percent of all staff members working in various economic sectors; women account for an average of 63 percent in agriculture; women account for 60 percent in the food industry; women account for 80 percent in the textile industry; women account for 40 percent in the fishing industry; women account for 30 percent in the construction industry; women account for 80 percent in the education and medical sectors; and women account for an average of more than 15 percent in heavy industry. Many women also hold leadership positions. For example, in the Ukrainian Republic, ten women serve as deputy ministers or hold positions equivalent to deputy ministers; 132 women are representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Republic; 36 Ukrainian women are representatives of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union; in the 25 states of Ukraine, 13 states have women serving as vice chairpersons of the state soviet; and among the party committee secretaries in all major cities in Ukraine, there are women comrades (note: party committees have several secretaries). Thousands upon thousands of heroes and models have also emerged among women. In Ukraine, 547 women have been awarded the title of Hero of Socialist Labor in agriculture. In addition, 30,730 women have been awarded medals and orders. At the Moscow Central Institute of Obstetrics and Gynecology, we saw the white-haired, 75-year-old obstetrician Popova. Before the October Revolution, she had participated in the Marxist group organized by Lenin and had been arrested by the Tsarist government. She had been a doctor for 42 years and had received two Orders of Lenin. She didn't seem old at all. At the Moscow Central Institute of Health Education, we saw a young, 23-year-old female doctor, Ivanova. In short, the Soviet women we saw, whether old or young, were all working hard. They knew how important selfless labor was for building a strong, prosperous, and happy motherland and for defending world peace.

The basic purpose of socialist production is to maximize the satisfaction of the constantly growing material and cultural needs of the working people. In the tall residential buildings built in Moscow, in addition to the bedrooms, kitchens, and bathrooms necessary for the residents, there are also clubs, libraries, department stores, public canteens, telephone bureaus, post offices, schools, kindergartens, nurseries, etc. In front of the building is a square garden. Housewives can get everything they need without leaving the building. After work and meals, they can take their children to stroll in the garden in front of the building.

All Soviet citizens can enjoy free medical care and social insurance. The lives of collective farm members are also very prosperous. When we visited the Lenin Collective Farm in Georgia, the farm members picked us up in their own five or six cars. The remuneration for each working day on the Lenin Collective Farm is 35 rubles, 3 kilograms of grain, and also honey, cheese, etc. The Kataria family of five, husband and wife and three older children work, and two younger children study at school. In 1953, their labor income on the collective farm was 6 tons of grain, 72,000 rubles, 200 kilograms of cheese, and 50 kilograms of honey. The income they received from their own private plots is not included.

The Soviet Communist Party and the government provide meticulous care for mothers and children. Soviet mothers have a high honor. About 600,000 mothers in the Ukrainian Republic have received medals. The Soviet Union firmly prohibits pregnant women and mothers with breastfeeding children from working night shifts. Factories have reserve workers to replace these pregnant women and mothers. Many factories have nurseries. The Stalin Automobile Factory alone has 16 nurseries. Most of the collective farms have nurseries during busy farming seasons, and there are also regular nurseries. The Moscow "Children's Book House" specializes in compiling and printing various reading materials for children. The best writers and artists in the Soviet Union write articles and draw pictures for children. Every city has excellent Young Pioneer Palaces, which are magnificent children's palaces built by the state at great expense. We saw many intelligent and lively children practicing drama, singing, painting, and writing in the Young Pioneer Palaces, holding geography discussion meetings, conducting chemical experiments, physical research, biological research, and astronomical studies, and playing various interesting games. Some children make various machine models, such as combine harvesters, tractors, and large cranes. In the Soviet Union, all children attend school for free. Schools pay special attention to combining theory and practice. Schools have various laboratories, workshops, and technical groups, and often invite experts to give reports to the children; and organize the children to visit factories and farms. Each child learns their native language and a foreign language and receives comprehensive technical education. From the happy lives of Soviet children and the various excellent educations they receive, we deeply feel that the next generation in the Soviet Union contains a huge force for building a communist society.

The family life of the Soviet people is also very happy. Their homes are all decorated very beautifully, with bedrooms, living rooms, and studies all complete. There are also steel beds, pianos, televisions, and electric refrigerators. The children's toys can fill half the room. Because they all have a high level of cultural education and political awareness, their family relationships are also particularly harmonious. From here, we further understand why the Soviet people love peace so much and work so tirelessly to defend world peace.

What we will never forget is the deep friendship of the Soviet people towards us. When we visited the factory, the factory director and engineers often pointed to the best machines and told us: "We want to give such the most modern machines to China." In bookstores, libraries, reading rooms, and even small book stalls, there are Chinese books, magazines, and pictorials translated into Russian everywhere. Soviet students held discussions on the construction of New China on a wide scale on our National Day. The Soviet people regard being able to go to China to help China's construction as the greatest glory. They love the Chinese people and love our leader Chairman Mao. At the Kiev No. 112 Middle School, many elementary school students were able to recite Chairman Mao's poems. After the Chinese delegation arrived in the Soviet Union, they were warmly welcomed and warmly received everywhere. In the parade celebrating the 36th anniversary of the October Socialist Revolution in Moscow, people held huge portraits of Chairman Mao. When they saw the Chinese delegation, they waved flowers and shouted: "Long live the great Chinese people!" Everywhere we heard the Soviet people say: "The close unity of the Soviet and Chinese people is the guarantee of world peace." The more we heard this sentence, the more we felt how powerful and true it was!

The Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow. All the construction achievements of the Soviet Union today, the happy life of the Soviet people today, were achieved through hard work under the leadership of Comrades Lenin and Stalin, the Soviet Communist Party, and the Soviet government. After the Soviet people seized power from the Tsar, they restored and developed the national economy under extremely difficult conditions. In order to develop heavy industry, the Soviet people tightened their belts and worked selflessly to accumulate construction funds for the country. Facts have proved that the path taken by the Soviet people is completely correct. It is precisely because they struggled hard in the past and developed a strong heavy industry that they were able to lay a solid foundation for the country's economic independence and the consolidation of national defense, as well as the further upsurge of the national economy, and to continue to develop heavy industry at a high speed today while rapidly developing the production of consumer goods and more fully meeting the people's ever-increasing material and cultural needs. Let us resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call, learn from the Soviet people's spirit of hard struggle, and strive for our country's socialist industrialization, for the socialist transformation of agriculture, handicrafts, and private industry and commerce, and for the gradual transition to a socialist society!

    赴苏观礼和参观的观感
    中国妇女代表团团长　许广平
    中华全国民主妇女联合会应苏联妇女反法西斯委员会的邀请，一九五三年派遣了二十人的代表团到莫斯科参加十月社会主义革命三十六周年的盛大典礼，并得到在苏联参观与学习二十八天的好机会。这次参观访问，把我们过去从书本上、报纸上得到的对伟大的社会主义国家的印象，和亲眼看到的生动具体的事实结合起来，使我们更进一步地体会到社会主义制度的优越性、苏联人民对和平事业的无限忠诚和为建设社会主义祖国的伟大的自我牺牲精神，以及他们的幸福生活；也使我们更深刻地体会到苏联人民对中国人民的深厚友谊。我们全体团员都感觉是受到了一次深刻的共产主义与国际主义的教育。
    我们在苏联看到的各个工厂、农庄都充分地说明了它们的生产确实是建立在高度的技术基础上的。在斯大林汽车工厂，我们亲眼看到每三分钟到五分钟就出一辆完好无缺的汽车，在卡尔·马克思制糖厂，每天可出产一百二十吨各种各样好吃的糖。在格鲁吉亚共和国的针织厂、茶厂，我们见到的机器都是全部自动化的。苏联农业机械化、电气化的程度也是任何资本主义国家不能相比的。在茵基里国营茶叶农场，我们看到一个采茶机每小时可采一百公斤茶叶。集体农庄的一切费力劳动都用机器来做。
    生产技术的进步和工业生产的增长是相辅而行的。苏联人民在苏联共产党和列宁、斯大林同志的英明领导下，执行了社会主义工业化的方针。苏联社会主义工业化的速度是惊人的。以一九四○年与一九一三年比较，俄罗斯联邦的工业增加到十二倍，塔吉克共和国的工业增加了二百七十七倍，格鲁吉亚共和国的工业增加了二十六倍，亚美尼亚的工业增加了二十三倍。和重工业的全面发展获得伟大成就的同时，在过去二十八年中，苏联日用品的生产量也增加为十二倍左右。苏联共产党和政府关心人民的福利，在继续发展重工业和在重工业已获得的胜利的基础上，现在又提出了大力发展轻工业、食品工业和农业的措施，以便随着人民购买力的提高，不断地满足人民的需要。
    苏联社会主义建设的伟大成就应该归功于苏联共产党的领导，归功于全体苏联人民的忘我的创造性的劳动。在这里我要特别说一说妇女，她们是社会主义建设中一支巨大的力量。在苏联各个工作部门里都有妇女在工作。以乌克兰共和国为例，参加各经济部门工作的妇女，平均占全体工作人员的百分之四十八；在农业中妇女平均占百分之六十三；食品工业中妇女占百分之六十；纺织工业中妇女占百分之八十；渔业中妇女占百分之四十；建筑业中妇女占百分之三十；在教育部门和医务部门中妇女占百分之八十；重工业中妇女平均占百分之十五以上。有许多妇女还担任领导工作，例如，在乌克兰共和国有十个妇女作副部长和相当于副部长的工作；一百三十二个妇女是乌克兰共和国最高苏维埃代表；三十六个乌克兰妇女是苏联最高苏维埃代表；乌克兰的二十五个州当中，有十三个州有妇女担任州苏维埃的副主席；在乌克兰所有的大城市的党委书记中都有妇女同志（按：党委会有数位书记）。妇女中间也出现了千千万万个英雄和模范。乌克兰在农业方面获得社会主义劳动英雄称号的妇女就有五百四十七人。此外还有三万零七百三十个妇女获得奖章和勋章。我们在莫斯科中央妇产科研究所，看到了满头白发的七十五岁的老产科医生波波娃。她在十月革命前曾参加过列宁所组织的马克思主义小组，曾被沙皇政府逮捕过；她一直当了四十二年的医生，得到了两个列宁勋章。她并没有一点老气。在莫斯科中央卫生教育研究所，我们看到一个年青的二十三岁的女博士伊凡诺娃。总之，我们看到的苏联妇女，不管是老年还是青年，都是努力地工作着，她们知道忘我的劳动对于建设富强幸福的祖国，对于保卫世界和平是多么的重要。
    社会主义的生产的基本目的是为了最大限度地满足劳动人民不断增长的物质和文化生活的需要。在莫斯科修建的高大的住宅大楼中，除了住户们所必需的卧室、厨房、洗澡间之外，俱乐部、图书馆、百货公司、公共食堂、电话局、邮局、学校、幼儿园、托儿所等应有尽有。大楼前面便是广场花园。主妇们足不出楼门就可以得到一切生活需要的东西，工余饭后还可带着孩子到门前的花园散步。
    所有苏联公民都可享受到免费医疗与社会保险。集体农庄庄员们的生活也很富裕。我们到格鲁吉亚列宁集体农庄参观时，是庄员们开着自己的五、六辆小汽车来接我们的。列宁集体农庄每个劳动日的报酬是三十五卢布、三公斤粮食，此外还有蜂蜜、乳酪等。庄员卡塔丽雅一家五口人，夫妇俩和大孩子三人工作，两个小孩在学校读书。一九五三年他们在集体农庄的劳动所得是六吨粮食、七万二千卢布、二百公斤乳酪和五十公斤蜂蜜。他们从自己的宅旁园地得到的收入还不计算在内。
    苏联共产党和政府对于母亲和儿童的关怀是无微不至的。苏联的母亲们有着很高的荣誉。乌克兰共和国有六十万左右的母亲们获得了奖章。苏联坚决不允许孕妇和有喂奶孩子的母亲作夜工，工厂里设有预备工去代替这些孕妇和母亲们。许多工厂都设有托儿所，仅斯大林汽车工厂一个厂就有十六个托儿所。集体农庄大部分是农忙托儿所，也有经常的托儿所。莫斯科的“儿童书籍之家”专门为孩子编印各种读物。苏联第一流的作家、美术家都给儿童们写文章和画图画。各个城市都有很好的少先宫，它们是国家花了大笔经费建设起来的宏大的儿童宫殿。我们看见许多聪明活泼的孩子们，在少先宫里练习演剧、唱歌、绘画、写作，开地理讨论会，作化学试验、物理研究、生物研究和天文学习，作各种各样有趣的游戏。有些孩子作各种各样机器模型，如联合机、拖拉机、大型起重机等。在苏联，儿童们上学全是免费的。学校特别注意理论和实际结合。学校有各种试验室、工作室以及技术小组，还常请专家来给孩子们作报告；并且组织孩子们到工厂、农庄去参观。孩子们每个人都学习本国语文和一种外国语文，都要受到综合的技术教育。从苏联的儿童们的幸福生活和他们得到的各种优良的教育，我们深深感到在苏联的后一代是蕴藏着多么巨大的建设共产主义社会的雄厚力量。
    苏联人民的家庭生活也很美满。他们家里都布置得很漂亮，卧室、客厅、书房样样齐全；还有钢丝床、钢琴、电视机、电气冰箱等；小孩子的玩具可以摆满半个屋子。由于他们都有高度的文化教养和政治觉悟，他们的家庭关系也特别融洽。从这里我们更进一步了解到苏联人民为什么那样热爱和平，那样不遗余力地为保卫世界和平而工作。
    使我们永念不忘的是苏联人民对我们的深厚友谊。我们在工厂参观时，厂长和工程师们常指着最好的机器告诉我们：“我们要把这样最新式的机器给中国。”在书店、图书馆、阅览室里，甚至是小书摊上，到处都有译成俄文的中国的书籍、杂志和画报。苏联的学生们在我国国庆日，普遍地举行关于新中国建设的讨论会。苏联人民都以能到中国帮助中国建设为最大的光荣。他们热爱中国人民，热爱我们的领袖毛主席。在基辅一一二中学，许多小学生都能够朗诵毛主席的诗。中国代表到了苏联后，到处受到热烈的欢迎与亲切的招待。在莫斯科庆祝十月社会主义革命三十六周年的游行队伍里，人们举着毛主席的巨像。他们看到了中国代表就挥动着鲜花，高声欢呼：“伟大的中国人民万岁！”我们到处都听到苏联人说：“苏中两国人民的亲密团结是世界和平的保证。”这句话我们听得越多，越感到它是多么有力，多么真实！
    苏联的今天，就是我们的明天。苏联今天的一切建设成就，苏联人民今天的幸福生活，是在列宁和斯大林同志，在苏联共产党和苏联政府领导下在艰苦奋斗中得来的。苏联人民从沙皇手上取得了政权之后，曾在极困难的条件下恢复和发展国民经济。为了发展重工业，苏联人民节衣缩食奋不顾身地劳动，替国家积累建设资金。事实证明，苏联人民走的道路是完全正确的。正是因为他们过去艰苦奋斗，发展了强大的重工业，才能为国家的经济独立和国防的巩固及国民经济的进一步高涨奠定坚实的基础，才能在今天继续高速度地发展重工业的同时，迅速地发展消费品的生产，更充分地满足人民不断提高的物质与文化生活的需要。让我们坚决地响应毛主席的号召，学习苏联人民艰苦奋斗的精神，为我们国家的社会主义工业化，为农业、手工业和私营工商业的社会主义改造，为逐步过渡到社会主义社会而努力奋斗吧！（新华社）
