Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, 6th -- "Labor News" reported the tragic life of the South Korean people, saying: The eight years of cruel rule and exploitation by the American-Syngman Rhee gang, and the three-year war they provoked, have made the lives of the South Korean people extremely miserable today. National industry and rural economy have been severely damaged, and the people's lives have fallen into despair.
According to the figures published by the Syngman Rhee puppet government, which are obviously reduced, the number of unemployed people in South Korea has now reached more than two million, and the number of war victims and semi-unemployed people is even greater. Many people have been displaced due to war disasters. In 1953 alone, about 1,600 people died on the streets of Busan. According to the puppet Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, South Korea lacked more than 7.17 million *seok* of grain in 1953. Despite such a shortage of grain production, the American-Syngman Rhee gang still carried out brutal plundering of farmers and prepared to export 1.5 million *seok* of grain to Japan. As a result, the vast majority of South Korean people are struggling on the verge of starvation. According to the puppet government, the number of people who committed suicide by poisoning or drowning due to unbearable hunger in various parts of South Korea is increasing day by day. From the beginning of 1953 to April, 143 people committed suicide in Gyeonggi Province alone.
The fate of South Korean women and children is even more tragic. According to the South Korean puppet "Dongyang News Agency," there are already hundreds of thousands of war widows in South Korea. The lives of these widows and their many children are very poor, some starving to death, and some沦为娼妓 (prostituting themselves). According to statistics from the puppet Ministry of Health alone, there are as many as 313,000 "hostesses" in South Korea, and more than 30% of them are sick.
In late November 1953, a fire broke out in Busan. The Syngman Rhee puppet government allowed the fire to spread, resulting in "the largest fire in Korean history," with more than 6,000 buildings completely burned to the ground, including 5,000 homes; more than 45,000 residents became disaster victims. The American-Syngman Rhee gang "accommodated" them in former POW camp sites surrounded by barbed wire, without providing any relief.
In order to maintain their reactionary rule, the American-Syngman Rhee gang carried out brutal persecution of the South Korean people. Every corner of South Korea is filled with so-called "police groups" and "patriotic groups" and other spy organizations, monitoring the people's every move. If a few farmers chat together, they will be accused of "unauthorized assembly" and arrested. The number of people who are arrested and imprisoned for no reason is constantly increasing.

    美李匪帮残酷统治和剥削的结果
    南朝鲜人民生活悲惨
     【新华社平壤六日电】“劳动新闻”报道南朝鲜人民悲惨生活的情景说：美李匪帮八年来的残酷统治和榨取，以及他们所挑起的三年战争，使今天的南朝鲜人民生活十分悲惨。民族工业和农村经济遭受严重破坏，人民生活已陷于绝境。
    据李承晚伪政府发表的显然是缩小了的数字，南朝鲜的失业人数现在已达二百万人以上，战争灾民和半失业的人数更多。许多人由于战争灾害而流浪街头。在一九五三年，仅在釜山市内，就约有一千六百人死在街头。据伪农林部透露，南朝鲜在一九五三年缺粮的数字是七百一十七万多石。尽管粮食产量这样不足，但美李匪帮仍对农民进行残暴的掠夺，并准备向日本输出一百五十万石粮食。因而，南朝鲜广大人民都在饥饿线上挣扎。据伪政府透露，南朝鲜各地因饥饿难忍而服毒或投江自杀的人数日益增多。从一九五三年年初到四月间，在京畿道就有一百四十三人自杀。
    南朝鲜妇孺们的命运，更加悲惨。据南朝鲜伪“东洋通讯社”透露，南朝鲜的战争寡妇已有几十万人。这些寡妇们和她们的许多子女的生活十分穷困，有的成为饿莩，有的沦为娼妓。仅据伪卫生部统计，南朝鲜的“女侍”竟达三十一万三千多人，而且其中有百分之三十以上都患病。
    一九五三年十一月下旬，釜山发生了火灾，李承晚伪政府听任火势蔓延，结果造成“朝鲜历史上最大的一次火灾”，共有六千多所建筑物全部化为灰烬，其中有五千栋住宅；有四万五千多居民成为灾民。美李匪帮把他们“收容”在围有铁丝网的过去的战俘营营场里，不给予任何救济。
    美李匪帮为了维持它们的反动统治，对南朝鲜人民进行残暴的迫害。南朝鲜的每一个角落都布置着所谓“警察小组”和“爱国小组”等特务组织，监视人民的一举一动。几个农民在一起闲谈，就会被指为“擅自集会”而加以逮捕。被无故逮捕而投入监狱的人不断地增加。
