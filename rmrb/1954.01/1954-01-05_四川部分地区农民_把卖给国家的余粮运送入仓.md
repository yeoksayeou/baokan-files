Farmers in some areas of Sichuan have recently been increasing the amount of surplus grain they sell to the state and transport into warehouses. In the Jiangjin and Luzhou regions of Sichuan, the amount of grain transported into warehouses originally was only three to four million jin per day, but by mid-December it had reached over ten million jin.

Various locations in Sichuan, based on the direction of grain flow and to facilitate transportation for farmers, have rationally determined the locations for grain storage, enabling farmers to quickly and systematically transport grain into warehouses. Farmers in Beiyan Township, Fuling County, sold a total of more than 175,000 jin of surplus grain to the state and transported it all into warehouses within three days. Farmers in Nanlong Township, Nanbu County, specifically established a warehouse entry work group to rationally adjust manpower, helping 139 households with more surplus grain but less manpower overcome the difficulty of transporting grain. The Wu Jifa Agricultural Production Cooperative in Jintang County mobilized its entire cooperative of twelve people and transported more than 16,000 jin of surplus grain into warehouses in one day. In Longtian Township, Guiding County, Guizhou Province, thirteen mutual aid teams quickly transported more than 10,000 jin of the best-selected surplus grain into warehouses. In the old revolutionary base areas of Bazhong and Wanyuan on the border of Sichuan and Shaanxi, farmers in many townships and towns collectively transported grain into warehouses.

    四川部分地区农民
    把卖给国家的余粮运送入仓
    最近四川部分地区农民运送出售给国家的余粮入仓的数字是不断地增加着。四川江津、泸州专区原来每天运送入仓的粮食只三、四百万斤，十二月中旬就达到一千万斤以上。
    四川各地根据粮食流转方向和便利农民运送，合理地确定了入仓地点，使农民能够迅速而有秩序地运送粮食入仓。涪陵县北雁乡农民总共卖给国家余粮十七万五千多斤，在三天内就全部运送入仓。南部县南隆乡农民特别成立了入仓工作组，合理调剂人力，使一百三十九户余粮多人力少的农民克服了运送粮食的困难。金堂县邬纪发农业生产合作社全社出动十二人，一天内就把一万六千多斤余粮运送入仓。贵州省贵定县龙田乡有十三个互助组很快就把挑选得最好的一万多斤余粮运送入仓。川陕边革命老根据地巴中、万源等地不少乡镇的农民集队送粮入仓。（据新华社讯）
