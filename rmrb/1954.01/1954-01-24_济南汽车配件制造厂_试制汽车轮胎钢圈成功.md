Jinan Automotive Parts Factory
    Successfully Trial-Produces Automobile Tire Rims
    The state-owned Jinan Automotive Parts Factory has successfully trial-produced automobile tire rims and is now producing them in large quantities to meet the needs of transportation departments in various regions. Automobile tire rims are one of the important parts on the chassis of a car. In the past, due to the limitations of our country's equipment and technical conditions, this part relied on foreign imports. In recent years, with the development of the transportation industry, the demand for tire rims has increased, especially the five-hole tire rims used on general large buses and trucks, which are even more scarce. In order to meet the needs of highway transportation in various regions, the Jinan Automotive Parts Factory began trial production in September of last year, imitating Soviet designs. During the trial production process, the factory's technical personnel went to the Tianjin Steel Rolling Plant to learn steel rolling techniques and organized workers to study the modification of old machines into steel rolling machines, feeding machines, etc., overcoming technical and equipment difficulties. Finally, the trial production was successful in December of last year. By the first half of January, the factory had produced more than 1,000 tire rims, supplying the transportation departments of the province and Tianjin.

    济南汽车配件制造厂
    试制汽车轮胎钢圈成功
    国营济南汽车配件制造厂试制汽车轮胎钢圈成功，现正大量生产，供应各地交通运输部门需要。汽车轮胎钢圈是汽车底盘上的重要配件之一。过去由于我国设备和技术条件的限制，这一配件都是依赖国外进口。近年来随着交通运输业的发展，轮胎钢圈需要量增加，特别是一般大型公共汽车、卡车上用的五眼轮胎钢圈更为缺乏。为了满足各地公路运输需要，济南汽车配件制造厂在去年九月份开始仿照苏联的式样试制。试制过程中，该厂技术人员先后到天津轧钢厂学习了辗钢技术，并组织工人研究将旧的机器改装成辗钢机、送料机等，克服了技术和设备上的困难。最后在去年十二月份试制成功。到一月上半月，该厂已生产轮胎钢圈一千余只，供应了本省和天津等地的运输部门。
