　　(Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 28th) Special correspondent report: The world-瞩目ed Panmunjom has become a just tribunal for publicly trying American aggressors who forcibly detained prisoners of war. This unprecedented crime by American aggressors has been finalized here.

　　After the armistice agreement was signed, directly repatriated Korean and Chinese prisoners of war disclosed the bloody inside story of the US POW camps to the joint Red Cross team at Panmunjom. After the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated were handed over to the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, 630 prisoners of war risked their lives to escape from the Tongchang-ri POW camp, or applied for repatriation after listening to explanations. They all passed through Panmunjom and returned to the embrace of their motherland. At the press conference in Panmunjom, they indignantly and tearfully recounted their personal experiences to the world, accusing the US side of using terrorist rule, torture, and massacre to prevent prisoners of war from requesting repatriation. They revealed numerous pieces of evidence of the US forcibly detaining prisoners of war to the Neutral Nations personnel and reporters from both sides on the spot. These evidences included insulting words and patterns tattooed all over their bodies, blood-stained wounds and horrifying scars, and hands and feet that were broken or crippled. These evidences also included leaflets coercing prisoners of war not to request repatriation, Chiang Kai-shek's threatening proclamations, shirts printed with the Chiang gang party flag, and secret instructions for special agents to sabotage the explanation work. And those prisoners of war who were driven insane by the US torture, only murmuring, "I want to return to my motherland," and those prisoners of war who had not eliminated their fear when they arrived at Panmunjom, fearing that the special agents would chase after them and drag them back, were living evidence of the US's crime of forcibly detaining prisoners of war through the use of military threats and terrorist rule.

　　In Panmunjom, the hellish scenes in the Tongchang-ri POW camp were completely exposed to the world. The returning prisoners of war accused the US special agents of openly issuing orders in the camp, throwing prisoners of war into dungeons and torture chambers. The special agents used barbaric methods such as disembowelment, heart extraction, strangulation, trampling, and beating to death to murder prisoners of war who requested repatriation, and used this to intimidate other prisoners of war, making them afraid to request repatriation. At least a dozen prisoners of war have been brutally murdered. As soon as a prisoner of war revealed a desire to be repatriated, he would be subjected to torture such as pouring chili water, pouring gasoline, using tiger benches, piercing fingernails, cutting flesh, and burning. Many prisoners of war were crippled and tortured into madness. The US special agents also continued to forcibly tattoo characters on the prisoners of war's chests, backs, arms, and even abdomens and calves on a large scale, and forced the prisoners of war to put blood fingerprints on the so-called "petitions against repatriation," cut their fingers to dye blood flags, and write blood letters, so that the prisoners of war would increase their suspicion and fear and dare not request repatriation.

　　In Panmunjom, the truth about the US directing special agents to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war was fully exposed. The returning prisoners of war cited many instructions and orders issued by the US to the special agents through various secret channels. These instructions and orders required the special agents to strictly prevent prisoners of war from escaping the camp to apply for repatriation. According to the US instructions, the special agents set up strict sentry posts around the camp and the prisoners of war tents, and formulated "prohibitions" such as "no approaching the barbed wire" and "report before going to the toilet," so that the prisoners of war could not move freely. They also forced prisoners of war to sign joint guarantee letters and "guarantee letters" to "go to Taiwan." If one prisoner of war escaped the camp, the other two prisoners of war would be killed. US special agents did not allow prisoners of war to talk to each other, nod and smile, mention their motherland and parents and children, or even say "Qianmenpai" cigarettes. If the prisoners of war inadvertently said these words in their sleep, they would be subjected to torture or beatings. At the same time, the "teachers" of the special agent organization "CIE" forced the prisoners of war to attend "classes" every day, creating a large number of rumors to intimidate and deceive them, making them afraid to ask to go home.

　　In Panmunjom, the US plot to sabotage the explanation work was thoroughly exposed. The returning prisoners of war accused the US special agents of reorganizing the prisoners of war and placing special agent elements with weapons in each group of prisoners of war in order to prevent the prisoners of war from leaving the camp to listen to the explanation, or to monitor and threaten them when listening to the explanation. They also forced the prisoners of war to carry out exercises to sabotage the explanation work, hold "demonstrations" against the explanation work, and forced them to recite the mantra of "returning to Taiwan" every day. US special agents deliberately misinterpreted the "scope of authority" and "working rules," so that they did not know that they had the right to listen to explanations and apply for repatriation. The US also used the prisoners of war's terrifying memories of the bloody "screening" on Geoje Island to create various rumors to intimidate them. They also forced the prisoners of war to wear the "national flags" of the Chiang and Li gangs, paint their faces, and insult the explanation representatives when listening to the explanation, in order to increase their suspicion and fear, making them afraid to request repatriation.

　　In Panmunjom, the US's signboard of "humanitarianism" was shattered. The myth created by the US that prisoners of war "would rather commit suicide than be repatriated" was completely bankrupt. The facts angrily revealed by the prisoners of war shocked the Neutral Nations personnel and reporters from various countries, and made those American reporters who were accustomed to spreading rumors speechless, and had to hide aside in disgrace. The Kuomintang special agents pointed out by the prisoners of war on the spot were pale and ashamed. The crimes of the American aggressors in sabotaging the explanation work and forcibly detaining prisoners of war have been publicly tried by the world in Panmunjom, and they will absolutely not escape the judgment of human justice.

　　板门店——公审强迫扣留战俘的美国侵略者的正义法庭
    【新华社开城二十八日电】本社特派记者报道：全世界瞩目的板门店已经成为公审强迫扣留战俘的美国侵略者的正义法庭。美国侵略者这一史无前例的罪行已经在这里最后定案。
    在停战协定签订以后，直接遣返的朝中被俘人员在板门店向联合红十字会小组人员揭露了美方战俘营的血腥内幕。在不直接遣返的朝中被俘人员被移交给中立国遣返委员会看管之后，又有六百三十名战俘冒着生命危险逃出东场里战俘营，或是在听取解释后申请遣返。他们全都经过板门店而回到了祖国的怀抱。他们在板门店的记者招待会上以亲身的经历，向全世界愤慨地、泣不成声地控诉了美方以特务统治、酷刑和屠杀阻止战俘要求遣返的骇人听闻的暴行。他们当场把美方强迫扣留战俘的无数罪证揭露给中立国人员和双方记者们看。这些罪证包括留下在他们身上的刺满全身的侮辱性的字句和图样，血迹斑斑的伤口和可怖的伤痕，被打断或是被打残废了的手和脚。这些罪证还包括美方胁迫战俘不得要求遣返的传单，蒋匪介石的恐吓文告，印有蒋匪党旗的衬衣，特务破坏解释工作的秘密指令。而那些被美方折磨得神经失常，只是喃喃地说：“我要回祖国”的战俘，那些到了板门店还没有消除恐惧心理，惟恐特务追来把他们拖回去的战俘，更是美方以武力威胁和恐怖统治强迫扣留战俘的罪行的活生生的证据。
    在板门店，东场里战俘营中的地狱景象完全暴露在全世界面前。归来的战俘们控诉说，美方特务公然在营场里发号施令，把战俘投入土牢和苦刑室。特务们用剖腹、挖心、绞死、踩死、打死等野蛮手段谋害要求遣返的战俘，并用以恫吓其他的战俘，使他们不敢要求遣返。至少已有十多名战俘被残酷杀害。战俘稍一流露出遣返的愿望，就要遭到灌辣椒水、灌汽油、上老虎凳、刺手指甲、割肉、火烧等酷刑。许多战俘被打成残废和被折磨成为疯子。美方特务还大规模地继续在战俘们的胸背、手臂甚至腹部、小腿上强迫刺字，并且强迫战俘们在所谓“反对遣返”的“请愿书”上盖血指印，割破手指染血旗、写血书，使战俘增加疑惧而不敢要求遣返。
    在板门店，美方指挥特务阻挠战俘遣返的真相全部暴露了。归来的战俘们举出了美方通过各种秘密途径发给特务们的许多指示和命令，这些指示和命令要特务们严防战俘逃出营场申请遣返。根据美方的指示，特务们在营场和战俘帐篷周围设置了严密的岗哨，并且订出了如“不准走近铁丝网”、“上厕所要报告”之类的“禁令”，使得战俘不能自由行动。他们还强迫战俘订立交连环保和写“到台湾去”的“保证书”，如果一个战俘逃出营场，其他两个战俘就要被杀死。美方特务不许战俘互相交谈，点头和微笑，不许提到祖国和父母孩子，甚至不许说“前门牌”香烟。战俘们在睡梦中不小心地说出了这些话，就要遭到酷刑或毒打。同时，特务组织“CIE”的“教员”每天强迫战俘上“课”，制造大量谣言对他们进行恫吓和欺骗，使得他们不敢要求回家。
    在板门店，美方破坏解释工作的阴谋被彻底揭穿了。归来的战俘们控诉说：美方特务把战俘重新编组，在每一组战俘中安插了带着凶器的特务分子，以便阻止战俘出营场听取解释，或者在听取解释时监视和威胁他们。他们还强迫战俘进行破坏解释工作的演习，举行反对解释工作的“示威”，并且强迫他们每天背诵“回台湾”的咒语。美方特务故意曲解“职权范围”和“工作细则”，使得他们不知道有听取解释和申请遣返的权利。美方并且利用战俘对巨济岛血腥“甄别”的恐怖记忆，制造各种谣言恫吓他们。他们还强迫战俘在听取解释时披带蒋、李匪帮的“国旗”、涂花脸、辱骂解释代表，以增加他们的疑惧心理，使得他们不敢要求遣返。
    在板门店，美方的“人道主义”的招牌被粉碎了。美国制造的所谓战俘“宁愿自杀也不愿遣返”的神话彻底破产了。战俘们愤怒地揭露的事实，使中立国人员和各国记者们为之震惊，使那些惯于造谣的美国记者们哑口无言，只好灰溜溜地躲在一边。被战俘当场指出的国民党特务面如土色，无地自容。美国侵略者破坏解释工作、强迫扣留战俘的罪行，已经在板门店受到了全世界的公审，它绝对逃脱不了人类正义的裁判。
