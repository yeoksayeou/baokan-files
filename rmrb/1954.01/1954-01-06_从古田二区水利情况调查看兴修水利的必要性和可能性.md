From an Investigation of Water Conservancy in the Second District of Gutian County, Seeing the Necessity and Possibility of Constructing Water Conservancy
The Second District Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, Gutian County, Fujian Province

I. Years of Water and Drought Disasters Have Caused Significant Losses to Agricultural Production

Gutian County's Second District has eight townships and one town, with a total of 45,970 mu of cultivated land. Of this, terraced fields account for 56% of the total cultivated land, paddy fields account for 29%, and other semi-terraced fields and agricultural land account for 15%. Two rivers run through seven townships in the district. The characteristic of the land is that those near the rivers fear flooding, and those near the mountains fear drought. Historically, varying degrees of water and drought disasters have occurred every year. In particular, the flood of the year before last and the drought of last year caused significant losses to agricultural production. In the four townships severely affected by the flood of the year before last, 3,456 mu of paddy fields were affected, accounting for 7.5% of the district's total cultivated land. More than 960 houses were washed away, and 27 large and small dams and 40 canals were damaged. In addition, losses of grain, agricultural tools, fertilizer, and livestock were also significant. Due to the severe damage to water conservancy, 5,317 mu of land could not be irrigated. After the flood, there was the threat of drought. After the flood, Party and government organizations organized consolation teams to go deep into the disaster areas to express sympathy, and vigorously led the masses to carry out rescue work, distributing 40,000 jin of relief grain and 170 million yuan in funds successively, helping farmers to build water conservancy projects, repair houses, and solve the problem of rations, so that the disaster situation was not able to expand, and the lives and production sentiments of the masses were stabilized. However, due to the severity of the flood, although vigorous rescue efforts were made, some land still had poor harvests. The year before last, the district's grain production was reduced by a total of 500,000 jin due to the flood. Last year's drought was also very serious. Almost all nine townships and towns in the district suffered varying degrees of drought. The drought-affected area reached 4,812 mu, accounting for 10.5% of the district's total cultivated land area. Although vigorous rescue efforts were made to reduce the losses, it is preliminarily estimated that the district's rice production was still reduced by about 550,000 jin due to the drought. These are only the losses in terms of grain. As for the labor and materials consumed during the disaster period, it is difficult to calculate. The severity of water and drought disasters in recent years, especially in the past two years, fully demonstrates the importance of preventing natural disasters and ensuring bumper harvests of crops. If we ignore this aspect of work, then there is no guarantee for the development of agricultural production.

II. Basic Situation of Current Water Conservancy

The district relies on five major water conservancy projects to divert water from rivers, irrigating 6,655 mu of paddy fields in five townships. Semi-terraced fields and some terraced fields mostly rely on 70 medium and small dams and 40 canals for irrigation. The district irrigates a total of 18,767 mu of farmland by diverting water from small rivers and mountain streams, accounting for 40.8% of the total cultivated land area. Terraced fields relying on spring water irrigation account for 16,000 mu, accounting for 35% of the total cultivated land. Rice fields irrigated by ponds and waterwheels account for 740 mu, accounting for about 1.6% of the total cultivated land. The rest rely on "heavenly water" (rain-fed agriculture). Fields irrigated by river water, as long as the water source is fully utilized, will not suffer from drought even in situations like last year. Fields irrigated by spring water, dams, canals, and ponds will suffer from drought if there is a long period of sunny weather without rain and a lack of water sources.

Judging from the situation in various townships, Qiaoyang Township has the best water conservancy conditions. It has a high terrain and few terraced fields. More than 4,600 mu of land are surrounded by three large canals for irrigation, but there are still 237 mu of land that rely on heavenly water and are prone to drought. Xinbang Township, which has relatively poor water conservancy conditions, has long had a saying among the masses: "Drought occurs when the moon is visible, and floods occur when it rains." Because the township is located in a low-lying area and is close to the river, about 600 mu of fields are flooded two or three times every year. When the flood occurred the year before last, the township's disaster-affected farmland reached more than 2,300 mu. At the same time, because of the poor water conservancy conditions, if it does not rain for half a month, more than 2,600 mu of paddy fields will suffer from drought. The water conservancy conditions in other townships are also not good enough, and there are water and drought disasters of varying degrees. Judging from the water and drought disasters of the year before last and last year, among the 61 natural villages in the district, 22 villages, with more than 13,200 mu of land, are not afraid of water or drought, accounting for 29% of the total cultivated land area. 39 villages, with more than 31,700 mu of land, are threatened by water and drought disasters, accounting for 69% of the district's cultivated land area. Among them, more than 3,800 mu of rice fields that rely on "heavenly water" and 2,000 mu of rice fields protected by flood control dikes are particularly vulnerable to water and drought disasters. Therefore, how to fully exploit the role of existing water conservancy projects and increase the construction of water conservancy projects to reduce the threat of natural disasters to crops is an urgent problem to be solved.

III. Exploiting the Potential of Water Conservancy

In order to solve the problem of water and drought disasters in the future, old farmers' associations have been convened in various townships, and the district's leading organs have also convened water conservancy work meetings to study the current water conservancy situation and solutions. For example, in Xinbang Township, which is vulnerable to disasters, if a 20-li long canal can be opened from Duanxi Township to divert river water for irrigation, then the water source problem for more than 2,600 mu of water-deficient paddy fields can be solved. More than 46,000 jin of grain can be produced annually, and more than 2,000 mu of land can be planted with spring soybeans and wheat, so that three crops can be grown throughout the year, and more grain can be produced. For example, if the existing Zhangling Dam, which is 15 li long, can be enlarged and heightened, and a 5-li long canal can be opened at the end of the canal, in addition to ensuring that more than 3,500 mu of fields are protected from drought, it can also expand the irrigation area by more than 600 mu, and it is estimated that more than 62,000 jin of grain can be produced annually. In addition to the above-mentioned two larger water conservancy projects, there are 18 reservoirs, 29 dams, and canals that can be built throughout the district this winter and spring. If all the above-mentioned water conservancy projects are completed, more than 11,000 mu of land will no longer be affected by drought, and the annual increase in grain production will be more than 249,000 jin. The grain produced in about two years will be enough to cover the cost of water conservancy.

In terms of flood control dikes, there are six places in the district that urgently need to be built. It is preliminarily estimated that more than 18,000 laborers and 300 million yuan are needed. After the dikes are built, they can ensure that more than 2,000 mu of land and residents near the dikes are no longer threatened by water and drought disasters.

The above only refers to construction. If we can strengthen the protection and management of water sources and fully exploit the irrigation efficiency of existing water conservancy equipment, as we did during last year's drought resistance, then the irrigated area can be further expanded.

In the past two years, the loans and relief funds issued by the people's government due to water and drought disasters have totaled 309 million yuan (excluding the public grain reduced and exempted by the government). Adding the reduction of more than 1 million jin of grain, the figures are huge. If we can transform passive relief into active construction and fully exploit the enthusiasm of farmers in building water conservancy projects, then the plan to build farmland water conservancy this spring can be completed.

IV. Issues to be Noted in Future Farmland Water Conservancy Construction

(1) Thoroughly mobilize the masses to make water conservancy construction a conscious and active action of the masses. According to the current situation, in areas with large areas of dry land and difficulties in building water conservancy projects, the masses mostly have the idea of "relying on heaven for food," believing that good or bad harvests are determined by "heaven" and that people are powerless. In villages with better water conservancy conditions, the masses mostly have complacency, thinking that there is no problem, and some canals and dams that could have been heightened and enlarged are not repaired. Individual villagers also have superstitious ideas of praying to gods for rain. To overcome the above-mentioned ideological obstacles, it is necessary to educate farmers to "think long-term" and use the water and drought disasters of the past two years to illustrate the importance of water conservancy construction, so that the vast number of farmers can recognize the important relationship between water conservancy construction and increasing grain production, supporting national construction, and improving their own lives, and fully exploit the enthusiasm of the masses in building water conservancy projects.

(2) Water conservancy construction must be carried out with leadership and organization. Some water conservancy projects are jointly owned by dozens of farmers, some belong to the people of the whole township, and some are jointly owned by several townships. On the other hand, water conservancy construction requires a lot of labor and cannot be carried out alone by one or two farmers. Therefore, if organizational leadership is not strengthened, it will not be done well if farmers rely on themselves to do it separately. For example, during the drought resistance period last year, the masses in Hangxia Village initially relied on each other and were unwilling to act, and everyone would rather spend a lot of effort every day to watch the water than to repair the water conservancy. Later, under the leadership of township cadres, 67 laborers were organized in mutual aid teams, and the canal was repaired in just one day, and two waterways were also opened, so that more than 500 mu of drought-affected fields were irrigated. Experience has proved that strengthening organizational leadership in water conservancy construction is the key to whether water conservancy can be built well.

(3) Improve the leadership style and deeply summarize the original experience of the masses in water conservancy construction. The masses have rich experience in water conservancy construction. As long as we can make a scientific summary, it will be of great benefit to our work. A water conservancy project in Tangguan Village was washed away by a flood last year, with a width of more than 20 zhang. The county people's government sent a technical cadre to measure it, saying that it would cost 80 million yuan to repair it. Later, the work team went deep into the masses, convened an old farmers' association, and brought into play the wisdom of the masses, deciding to block both sides with wood and fill the middle with stones. As a result, the project was repaired with a loan of only more than 6 million yuan, freeing more than 230 mu of fields from the threat of drought and flood disasters.

(4) Strengthen technical guidance in water conservancy construction, avoid blind construction or substandard projects, so as to overcome the waste of manpower and materials. Some water conservancy projects require large investments, which the masses are currently unable to afford. According to the actual needs of the project, it is also very necessary for the government to provide economic and technical support.

(5) Strengthen the management of existing water conservancy equipment and implement rational water use. In the future, each township should organize certain water conservancy institutions, formulate a practical and rational water use system, and, according to different situations, implement "one-person contracting management" or "section-by-section contracting management," regularly check, repair in time, and pay attention to timely resolving possible water conservancy disputes, and fully exploit the irrigation efficiency of existing water conservancy equipment.

    从古田二区水利情况调查看兴修水利的必要性和可能性
    中共福建省古田县第二区区委会
    一、历年水、旱灾害使农业生产受了重大损失
    古田县二区有八个乡、一个镇，共有耕地四万五千九百七十亩，其中山田占总耕地百分之五十六、洋田占百分之二十九、其他半山田和农地占百分之十五。全区有两道河流流贯七个乡。土地特点是靠河的怕水，靠山的怕旱。历来每年都要发生不同程度的水、旱灾害，特别是前年的水灾与去年的旱灾，使农业生产受了重大损失。前年水灾严重的四个乡，受灾稻田共达三千四百五十六亩，占全区总耕地的百分之七点五，房屋被水冲倒九百六十多间，冲坏大小水坝二十七条、水渠四十条，此外，粮食、农具、肥料、家畜等损失也不少。由于水利遭受严重破坏，有五千三百十七亩田地无水灌溉，水灾过后，又遭到旱灾的威胁。水灾发生后，党政机关组织慰问队深入灾区慰问，并大力领导群众进行抢救，先后发放救济粮四万斤、款一亿七千万元，帮助农民兴修水利，修建房屋和解决口粮问题，使灾情没有能够扩大，安定了群众的生活与生产情绪。但是，由于水灾的严重，虽经大力抢救，有些土地仍然歉收，前年全区因水灾减产粮食共达五十万斤。去年旱灾也很严重，全区九个乡、镇差不多普遍发生了不同程度的干旱，受旱面积达四千八百一十二亩，占全区总耕地面积百分之十点五。虽经大力抢救，减轻了损失，但全区初步估计因受旱减产的稻谷仍达五十五万斤左右。这些仅是粮食上的损失，至于在灾害期间消耗的劳力和物力，那就难以计算了。历年来，特别是近两年来水、旱灾害的严重，充分说明防止自然灾害、保证农作物丰收的重要，如果我们忽视了这方面的工作，那么，农业生产的发展就没有保证。
      二、目前水利的基本情况
    全区依靠河流输水的共有五条大水利，灌溉着五个乡的六千六百五十五亩洋田。半山田与部分山田，大部依靠七十条中、小水坝和四十条水渠来灌溉。全区引小河与山坑水灌溉的农田共有一万八千七百六十七亩，占总耕地面积百分之四十点八；依靠泉水灌溉的山田，有一万六千亩，占总耕地百分之三十五；靠池水和车水灌溉的稻田有七百四十亩，约占总耕地百分之一点六；其他是靠“吃天水”的田。靠河水灌溉的田，只要充分利用水源，即使像去年的情况，仍不会受旱；靠泉水、水坝、水渠及池水灌溉的田，如果久晴不雨，水源缺乏，土地就要受旱。
    从各乡情况看来，水利条件最好的乔洋乡，地势高、山田少，四千六百多亩土地就有三条大水渠环绕灌溉，但是仍有二百三十七亩田地靠吃天水，容易受旱。水利条件较差的新舫乡，多年来群众就流传这样一句话：“月亮露出来就发生旱灾，天一下雨就发生水灾。”该乡因为地势低，又靠近河边，每年都有六百亩左右的田要受水淹两三次，前年发生水灾时，全乡受灾农田即达二千三百多亩；同时因为水利条件差，假如半月不下雨，则二千六百多亩洋田又要受旱。其他各乡水利条件也不够好，都有轻重不同的水、旱灾害。从前年和去年水、旱灾害的情况来看，全区六十一个自然村中，不怕水又不怕旱的有二十二个村，土地一万三千二百多亩，占总耕地面积百分之二十九；受水、旱灾害威胁的有三十九个村，土地三万一千七百余亩，占全区耕地面积的百分之六十九，其中特别容易遭受水、旱灾害的是三千八百多亩靠“吃天水”的稻田和两千亩靠防洪堤保护的稻田。因此，如何充分发挥原有水利工程的作用和增修水利，以减轻自然灾害对农作物的威胁，是个急待解决的问题。
      三、发挥水利的潜在力
    为今后解决水、旱灾害问题，各乡先后召开了老农会，同时区领导机关并召开了水利工作会议，研究了当前的水利情况和解决问题的办法。例如易受灾害威胁的新舫乡，如果能从端溪乡开一条二十里长的水渠把河水引来灌溉，那么，两千六百多亩缺水的洋田，水源问题就可解决，每年可增产四万六千斤以上的粮食，而且还有两千多亩土地可种植春大豆和小麦等，使全年能种三季作物，可增产更多的粮食。又如樟岭坝一条长十五里的水坝，如能把原有水坝加大加高，在渠尾再开一条五里长的圳，除可保证三千五百多亩田不受旱外，还能扩大灌溉面积六百多亩，估计每年可增产粮食六万二千斤以上。除了上述两处较大的水利，全区去冬今春尚可修建的水利有水池十八个、水坝和水渠二十九条。上述水利如果全部修好，就可使一万一千多亩土地不再受旱，一年能增产粮食二十四万九千多斤，大约两年多增产的粮食，就够水利成本了。
    防洪堤方面全区急需修筑的有六处，初步估计需用一万八千多个民工，需款三亿元。堤岸修好后能保证两千多亩土地和堤岸附近居民不再受水、旱灾害的威胁。
    以上仅系指兴修方面，如能像去年抗旱时一样，加强水源的保护和管理，充分发挥现有水利设备的灌溉效能，那么灌溉面积还可扩大。
    两年来，人民政府由于水、旱灾害发放的贷款和救济款共达三亿零九百万元（政府减免的公粮未计算在内），加上减产的一百多万斤粮食，数字是巨大的。假如我们能将消极救济转变为积极建设，并充分发挥农民兴修水利的积极性，那么，今春兴修农田水利的计划是有办法完成的。
    四、今后兴修农田水利中要注意的问题
    （一）深入发动群众，使兴修水利成为群众自觉的积极的行动。根据现在情况，旱田面积大、兴修水利又有困难的地区，群众多存在“靠天吃饭”思想，认为收成好坏是由“天”决定，人们无能为力。水利条件较好的乡村，群众多存在麻痹思想，认为没有问题，有些渠坝原来可以加高加大的也不修。个别乡村群众还存在求神祈雨的迷信思想。要克服以上的思想障碍，必须教育农民“从长着想”，以两年来的水、旱灾害说明兴修水利的重要性，使广大农民认识兴修水利与增产粮食、支援国家建设、改善自己生活的重大关系，充分发挥群众兴修水利的积极性。
    （二）兴修水利必须有领导有组织地进行。有的水利工程是几十户农民共有的，有的是属于全乡人民的，也有的是几个乡共有的。另一方面，兴修水利花工很大，不是一两个农民能单独进行的，因此如果不加强组织领导，光凭农民自己分散去搞，是搞不好的。如去年抗旱期中杭下村群众最初由于互相观望依赖，大家宁愿每天花很多工夫去看水，也不去修好水利。后来在乡干部领导下，以互助组为单位，组织了六十七个劳力，只一天就把水圳修好了，还开了两条水道，使五百多亩受旱田地得到了灌溉。经验证明加强兴修水利工作中的组织领导工作，是能否修好水利的关键。
    （三）改善领导作风，深入总结群众原有兴修水利的经验。群众是有丰富的兴修水利的经验的，只要我们能加以科学的总结，对工作就有莫大好处。唐官村有一处水利工程，去年被洪水冲坏了二十多丈宽，县人民政府派一个技术干部来测量了一下，说要八千万元才能修好。后来工作组深入群众，召开老农会，发挥群众的智慧，决定两边用木材拦住，中间用石头填实，结果只贷款六百多万元，工程就修好了，使二百三十多亩田免除了旱、涝灾害的威胁。
      （四）加强兴修水利工作中的技术指导，避免盲目施工或工程不合标准的现象，以克服人力、物力的浪费。有的水利工程投资较大，群众目前无力负担，可根据工程实际需要，由政府给予经济上与技术上的支持，也是很必要的。
      （五）加强现有水利设备的管理工作，实行合理用水。今后各乡要组织一定的水利机构，订出切合实际的合理用水制度，根据不同情况，试行“一人包管制”或“分段包管制”，经常检查，及时修补，并注意及时解决可能发生的水利纠纷问题，充分发挥现有水利设备的灌溉效能。
