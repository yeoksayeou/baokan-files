Demonstration Farms in Eastern Inner Mongolia Actively Guide Farmers to Improve Production

The eighteen demonstration farms in the eastern region of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region are actively guiding farmers to improve production. These state-run farms use new agricultural implements and advanced agricultural science and technology for cultivation, demonstrating high yields to farmers, promoting improved seeds and new agricultural implements, and regularly helping farmers improve production techniques. In 1953, the Zhalantun Demonstration Farm promoted more than 57,000 catties of improved wheat and soybean seeds. Agricultural production cooperatives, mutual aid teams, and farmers in the vicinity who used improved seeds greatly increased their yields per unit area. Therefore, before the farm had even harvested its soybeans, some farmers came to order seeds. During the summer weeding season, the Zhalantun Demonstration Farm cooperated with the Nu Tuke (district) to hold training classes for women on thinning seedlings, teaching techniques for thinning and protecting seedlings, and helped the Qu Laiqing mutual aid team and others establish technical guidance organizations to promote advanced high-yield experiences. The Wafang Demonstration Farm in Kulun Banner also systematically educated Wafang Village farmers in cultivation techniques, and organized all villagers to catch insects in the summer, effectively preventing pests. The Yindeer Demonstration Farm in Zhalait Banner improved the old-style rake, carried out wide sowing, and organized nearby agricultural labor models, directors of agricultural production cooperatives, leaders of mutual aid teams, and propagandists to visit the new cultivation methods, and lent the improved rake to farmers for use. The Sanyitang Demonstration Farm in Tongliao County regularly sends technical cadres to nearby agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams to guide production, and at the same time researches and develops some agricultural implements suitable for wide sowing, which are introduced to the farmers in a timely manner.

The demonstration farms have also played a role in promoting new agricultural implements. When the Budunhua Demonstration Farm in the Middle Banner of Horqin Right Wing used seeders to plant land, it invited representatives from local agricultural production cooperatives and mutual aid teams to visit. When the weeding season arrived, the representatives began to borrow shovel-hoes from the farm. Some farmers in Kulun Banner saw that the demonstration farm used walking plows to turn the land and increase grain production, and actively purchased walking plows. (Xinhua News Agency)

    内蒙古东部区示范农场
    积极指导广大农民提高生产
    内蒙古自治区东部区的十八所示范农场，正积极指导广大农民提高生产。这些国营农场采用新式农具和先进的农业科学技术进行耕作，以高额产量向农民示范，并推广优良种籽、新式农具，经常地帮助农民改进生产技术。扎兰屯示范农场一九五三年推广了小麦、大豆的优良种籽，共五万七千多斤，附近的农业生产合作社、互助组及农民，凡采用优良种籽的都大大提高了单位面积产量，所以当农场还没有收割大豆时，有些农民就跑来订购种籽了。在夏锄时候，扎兰屯示范农场配合努图克（区）举办妇女间苗训练班，传授间苗、保苗的技术，并且帮助曲来清互助组等成立技术指导组织，推广了先进的丰产经验。库伦旗瓦房示范农场也向瓦房村农民系统地进行耕作技术教育，夏天还组织全村农民捕虫，有效地防治了虫害。扎赉特旗音德尔示范农场将旧式耲耙加以改良后，进行宽播，组织附近的农业劳动模范、农业生产合作社主任、互助组长及宣传员等，前来参观新耕作法，并将改良耲耙借给农民使用。通辽县三义堂示范农场，经常派技术干部到附近的农业生产合作社、互助组指导生产，同时研究出一些适应宽播的农具，及时向农民们介绍。
    各示范农场对推广新式农具，也起了一些作用。科尔沁右翼中旗布敦花示范农场，使用播种机种地时，曾邀请当地农业生产合作社和互助组代表来参观，代表们到了夏锄时候便开始向农场借用铲?机。库伦旗有些农民看到示范农场使用步犁翻地增产了粮食，也积极购置步犁。　　　　（新华社）
