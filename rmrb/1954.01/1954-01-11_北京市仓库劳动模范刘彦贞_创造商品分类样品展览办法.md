Beijing Warehouse Labor Model Liu Yanzhen Creates Sample Exhibition Method for Commodity Classification

Liu Yanzhen, a warehouse keeper at the Beijing Company of the China Department Store Corporation and a Beijing warehouse labor model, has created a "Sample Exhibition of Classified Inventory Commodities" method after creating the "Warehouse Instruction Chart." At this exhibition, after research and selection by salespeople, more than 6,000 dozen socks of different brands that had been backlogged in the warehouse for a long time were quickly transferred to sales units and sold to consumers.

In the past, the Beijing Department Store Company's sock warehouse had more than 500 kinds of socks, but even the units with the highest sales only sold more than 160 kinds, and the rest were backlogged in the warehouse for a long time, occupying a large amount of capital. After several investigations and studies, Liu Yanzhen analyzed that the reason for this phenomenon was mainly the insufficient connection between warehouse keepers and salespeople. In order to overcome this shortcoming, Liu Yanzhen took out samples of various socks that were not available in stores and held an exhibition, inviting salespeople from various sales units to visit under the leadership's arrangement. At the meeting, the various goods were introduced to different sales units based on their different qualities, colors, and specifications. The method of comparing quality and price was used to eliminate the salespeople's "brand name" mentality. As a result, salespeople proposed more than 6,000 dozen plain-mouth socks in half a day.

Now, the Beijing Department Store Company has decided to promote this method so that inventory commodities can meet the vast number of consumers in a timely manner.

    北京市仓库劳动模范刘彦贞
    创造商品分类样品展览办法
    中国百货公司北京市公司仓库保管员、北京市仓库劳动模范刘彦贞，继创造“仓库指示图表”后，又创造了“库存商品分类样品展览会”办法。在这个会上，经过售货员研究选择，长期积压在仓库内的六千多打不同牌号的袜子，很快地提到销货单位，销到消费者手中。
    过去北京市百货公司袜子仓库有五百多种袜子，但销货最多的单位也不过销一百六十多种，其余都长期积压在仓库内，占压了大量资金。刘彦贞在经过多次的调查研究后，分析出造成这种现象的原因，主要是保管员与售货员结合不够。为了克服这个缺点，刘彦贞将门市没有的各种袜子，一一取出样品，举办一个展览会，由领导上召集各销货单位售货员来参观。会上根据各种商品不同的质量、颜色、规格，向销路不同的销货单位介绍。并用比质比价的方法，来消除售货员的“名牌”思想。结果，半天内售货员即提出六千余打的平口袜子。
    现在北京市百货公司决定推广这一办法，使库存商品能及时与广大消费者见面。
