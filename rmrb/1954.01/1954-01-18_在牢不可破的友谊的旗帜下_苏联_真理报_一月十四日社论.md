Under the Banner of Indestructible Friendship
    —"Pravda" Editorial, January 14th

    The Soviet people are preparing to commemorate a distinguished historical event—the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia. This event is not only a festival for the Ukrainian and Russian peoples, but also a great festival for all other nationalities of the Soviet Union.

    The recently published "Outline for Propaganda on the 300th Anniversary of the Reunification of Ukraine with Russia (1654-–1954)," approved by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, powerfully illustrates the great historical significance of the reunification of the Ukrainian and Russian peoples into a unified Russian state, announced at the Pereyaslav Council in January 1654, three hundred years ago.

    This historically significant act ended the long struggle of the freedom-loving Ukrainian people against foreign enslavers, striving for reunification with the fraternal Russian people, whom the Ukrainian people always regarded as their reliable defenders and allies.

    The reunification of Ukraine with Russia is the inevitable result of the entire historical development of the two great fraternal Slavic nations. This merger was determined by the centuries-long development of economic, political, and cultural relations between Ukraine and Russia, and it conformed to the vital interests and aspirations of both nations. Reunification promoted the development of the productive forces of Russia and Ukraine and the mutual enrichment of the cultures of the two major fraternal nations.

    Although Russia was then under the rule of the Tsar and landlords, the reunification of Ukraine with Russia was still of extremely significant progressive importance for the further political, economic, and cultural development of the Ukrainian and Russian peoples. It consolidated the unity of these two major nations in their common struggle against foreign enslavers, and also consolidated their unity in the common struggle against the oppression of the feudal lords of Russia and Ukraine and the most vicious enemy of the Russian peoples—Tsarist autocracy.

    The development of capitalism in Russia gave rise to a new class—the proletariat. For the first time in history, the working people of our various nationalities obtained a reliable leader in their struggle for social and national liberation. The truly workers' Marxist party, established at the beginning of the twentieth century, was the leading and guiding force that led the working class and all working people to victory over the Tsarist system, landlords, and bourgeoisie, and it inspired and organized the masses in the struggle for socialism. From the beginning, our Party has been the standard-bearer of proletarian internationalism and the idea of friendship among all nationalities.

    The Party's brilliant leader and organizer, V.I. Lenin, for the first time in the history of Marxism, formulated the Party's theoretical program and policy on the national question, and explained that the national question is an integral part of the working class's entire revolutionary struggle for the dictatorship of the proletariat. Lenin was the inspirer of the policy of equality and friendship among all nationalities, and he guided the application of this policy in practice.

    Lenin's programmatic instructions on the national question were further creatively developed in the works of J.V. Stalin, the great successor to Lenin's immortal cause, and in the Party's resolutions. The Party defended the principles of proletarian internationalism, striving to emphasize the necessity of unified action by the proletariats of all nations and their closer unity around the Russian proletariat.

    Under the leadership of the Communist Party, under the banner of proletarian internationalism and fraternal friendship among all nationalities, the great October Socialist Revolution triumphed in our country. The Ukrainian people, who had traversed a long road of common revolutionary struggle with the great Russian people, followed their Russian brothers and embarked first on the road of the October Socialist Revolution, beginning a new glorious era in their history. With the fraternal assistance of the Russian people, they realized their long-cherished dream—to establish a truly free, autonomous national state, a national state that occupies an important position in the big family of Soviet republics.

    The workers and peasants of Ukraine, together with the Russian and other nationalities of our country, defended the Soviet Republic against domestic and foreign enemies, founded and built the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics, and fought to implement the Party's program for building socialism in our country. Simultaneously with the victory of socialism, the long-standing friendship between the Russian, Ukrainian, and other nationalities of our country has become a powerful, indestructible force.

    The growth of the power of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics has enabled the Ukrainian people to realize the long-standing dream of reunifying their nation. After the reunification of all Ukrainian lands, Soviet Ukraine became one of the largest countries in Europe.

    During the difficult years of the Great Patriotic War, the Ukrainian people, together with other nationalities of the Soviet Union, waged a selfless struggle against the German fascist invaders and their lackeys. In the course of the Patriotic War, the indestructible friendship of the peoples of the Soviet Union was further tempered.

    After the victorious conclusion of the Great Patriotic War, the working people of Soviet Ukraine, with the fraternal assistance of Russia and other nationalities of our country, completely restored the republic's economy and achieved brilliant achievements. The output of Ukraine's large industry in 1952 was seventeen times the output of Ukraine's industry before the revolution. Electricity production increased more than thirty-seven times; metal processing industry output increased nearly sixty-nine times; coal production increased more than four times; pig iron production increased four and a half times; and steel production increased nearly five times.

    The collective farms of Ukraine have been restored and consolidated, and their material and technical foundations have become more solid. At present, in the fields of Ukraine, there are 182,000 tractors (each calculated at 15 horsepower), 51,000 grain combine harvesters, and tens of thousands of other complex agricultural machines. The Ukrainian collective farmers, due to their selfless labor, have achieved unprecedented good harvests in winter wheat, sugar beets, and other major crops.

    The Ukrainian people, together with all the nationalities of the Soviet Union, are successfully struggling to complete the Fifth Five-Year Plan and to further consolidate the power of our socialist country. The fighting program of the Ukrainian working people, like that of the working people of the whole country, is the historic resolutions of the 19th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the September Plenary Session of the Party Central Committee, as well as a series of subsequent resolutions of the Party and the government on further developing the country.

    On the basis of the continuous development of the national economy, the material welfare of the broad masses of the people is constantly improving, and the socialist culture of Ukraine is flourishing. This culture is developing on the basis of Marxism-Leninism and in close connection with the cultures of the fraternal nationalities of the Soviet Union.

    The indestructible friendship of the various nationalities of the Soviet state is the great achievement of the Communist Party and its brilliant Leninist-Stalinist nationality policy. As long as this friendship exists, we have nothing to fear from any enemies, domestic or foreign.

    The Ukrainian people, the Russian people, and other nationalities of our great motherland, closely united with the Communist Party and the Soviet government, greet the significant festival of the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia. In the various union republics, Party organizations, Soviet organizations, and social organizations have launched preparations for the celebration, explaining to the masses the historical significance of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia. On the day of the 300th anniversary of the Pereyaslav Council—January 18, 1954—reports and discussions on the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia and on the Leninist-Stalinist friendship between the nationalities of our country will be held in various enterprises, institutions, schools, collective farms, state farms, and machine tractor stations. Newspapers, magazines, and radio programs will commemorate this important event in the history of our motherland and elucidate the further consolidation of the friendship between the nationalities of the Soviet Union.

    The mass political work related to the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia will continue from this January to May. Higher education institutions and scientific institutions are preparing to convene special meetings and commemorative meetings during this period. The Presidium of the Soviet Academy of Sciences will convene an academic conference commemorating the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia, and will invite a delegation from the Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic to participate. The Academy of Sciences of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic will convene a commemorative meeting in Kiev.

    In May, commemorative meetings of laborers will be held in various enterprises, collective farms, state farms, machine tractor stations, schools, and institutions.

    The 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia is a great national festival of the nationalities of the Soviet Union, and it will be celebrated throughout the Soviet Union in May this year. In May, the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic will hold a commemorative meeting in Moscow, while the Supreme Soviet of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic will also hold a commemorative meeting in Kiev. Celebration conferences will also be held in the capitals of other union republics.

    The peoples of the Soviet Union greet this significant historical festival—the 300th anniversary of the reunification of Ukraine with Russia—with new outstanding achievements in economic and cultural construction and with the further consolidation of their indestructible fraternal friendship.

    The entire historical experience of the nationalities of the Soviet Union significantly proves the great significance of their friendship with the great Russian people, and proves the invincible power of the fraternal alliance and close cooperation of the nationalities of our country. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, the peoples of our country have built socialism and are now confidently advancing towards the victory of communism.

    在牢不可破的友谊的旗帜下
    ——苏联“真理报”一月十四日社论
    苏联人民正准备纪念一个特出的历史事件——乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年。这一事件不仅是乌克兰和俄罗斯人民的节日，而且是苏联所有其他各民族的一个伟大节日。
    最近发表的苏联共产党中央委员会批准的“乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年（一六五四——一九五四年）宣传提纲”，有力地说明了三百年前一六五四年一月在佩雷雅斯拉夫议会上宣布的乌克兰和俄罗斯人民重新合并于统一的俄罗斯国家中的巨大历史意义。
    这个具有历史意义的行动，结束了爱好自由的乌克兰人民为反对外国奴役者，争取与同族的兄弟般的俄罗斯人民重新合并而进行的长期斗争，乌克兰人民始终认为俄罗斯人民是他们可靠的保卫者和同盟者。
    乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯是两个伟大的兄弟斯拉夫民族过去全部历史发展的必然结果。这次合并是由乌克兰与俄罗斯在许多世纪中的经济、政治和文化关系的发展决定的，它符合于这两个民族的切身利益和愿望。重新合并促进了俄罗斯和乌克兰的生产力的发展和两大兄弟民族文化的相互丰富。
    尽管当时俄国是在沙皇和地主的统治下，乌克兰的重新合并于俄罗斯，对于乌克兰和俄罗斯人民的政治、经济和文化的进一步发展是有极重大的进步意义的。它巩固了这两大民族在反对外国奴役者的共同斗争中的团结，也巩固了在反对俄罗斯和乌克兰的封建主的压迫和俄罗斯各族人民最凶恶的敌人——沙皇专制制度的共同斗争中的团结。
    俄罗斯资本主义的发展产生了一个新的阶级——无产阶级。我国各民族的劳动人民，在争取社会解放和民族解放的斗争中，有史以来第一次得到了可靠的领袖。二十世纪初建立的真正工人的马克思主义的政党，是引导工人阶级和全体劳动人民战胜沙皇制度、地主和资产阶级的领导的和主导的力量，它在争取社会主义的斗争中鼓舞并组织了群众。从开始起，我党就是无产阶级国际主义和各民族友谊的思想的旗手。
    党的天才的领袖和组织者，乌·伊·列宁在马克思主义的历史上第一次拟订了党关于民族问题的理论纲领和政策，并说明了民族问题是工人阶级争取无产阶级专政全部革命斗争的一个组成部分。列宁是各民族平等和友好政策的鼓舞者，并指导在实际中应用这个政策。
    列宁关于民族问题的纲领性的指示在列宁的不朽事业的伟大继承者——约·维·斯大林的著作以及党的决议中，得到了进一步的、创造性的发展。党捍卫着无产阶级国际主义原则，竭力强调各民族无产阶级统一行动的必要性和他们更加紧密地团结在俄罗斯无产阶级周围的必要性。
    在共产党的领导下，在无产阶级国际主义和各民族兄弟般的友谊的旗帜下，伟大的十月社会主义革命在我国胜利了。和伟大的俄罗斯人民一道走过共同革命斗争长途的乌克兰人民，继俄罗斯兄弟之后，首先走上了十月社会主义革命的道路，开始了他们历史上新的光荣的时代。它在俄罗斯人民的兄弟般的帮助下，实现了他们多年来的梦想——建立起真正自由的，自主的民族国家，这个国家在苏维埃共和国大家庭中占有重要地位的民族国家。
    乌克兰的工人和农民和俄罗斯及我国其他各族人民一起反对国内外敌人而保卫了苏维埃共和国，创立并建成了苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟，为实现共产党所制订的在我国建设社会主义的纲领而作了斗争。与社会主义胜利同时，俄罗斯、乌克兰和我国其他各族人民的悠久的友谊变成了强大的、不可摧毁的力量。
    苏维埃社会主义共和国联盟的威力的增长，使乌克兰人民有可能实现重新统一他们民族的长期的梦想。在全部乌克兰土地重新统一后，苏维埃乌克兰成为了欧洲最大国家之一。
    在伟大卫国战争的艰苦年代中，乌克兰人民和苏联其他各族人民一起，与德国法西斯侵略者及其走狗进行了忘我的斗争。在卫国战争的过程中，苏联各族人民的牢不可破的友谊受到了进一步的锻炼。
    伟大的卫国战争胜利结束以后，苏维埃乌克兰的劳动人民在俄罗斯和我国其他各族人民的兄弟般的帮助之下，完全恢复了共和国的经济，并获得了辉煌的成就。乌克兰的大工业一九五二年的产量为革命前乌克兰工业产量的十七倍。电力产量增加为三十七倍以上；金属加工工业产量几乎增加为六十九倍；煤产量增加为四倍以上；生铁产量增加为四点五倍；钢的产量几乎增加为五倍。
    乌克兰的集体农庄已经恢复和巩固，它的物质技术基础更加雄厚了。目前在乌克兰的田野上，有十八万二千台拖拉机（每台以十五匹马力计算），五万一千台谷物联合收割机以及几万台其他的复杂的农业机器。乌克兰集体农民，由于他们的忘我的劳动，在冬小麦、甜菜和其他主要农作物方面都获得了前所未有的好收成。
    乌克兰人民和苏联各族人民一起，正在为完成第五个五年计划，为进一步巩固我们社会主义强国的威力而顺利地进行斗争。乌克兰劳动人民和全国劳动人民一样，他们的战斗纲领是苏联共产党第十九次代表大会和党中央九月全会的历史性决议，以及随后党和政府关于进一步发展国家的一系列决议。
    在国民经济不断发展的基础上，广大人民群众的物质福利正在不断提高，乌克兰的社会主义文化繁荣着，这种文化是在马克思列宁主义思想的基础上、在与苏联各兄弟民族文化的紧密联系中发展起来的。
    苏维埃国家各族人民牢不可破的友谊是共产党和它的英明的列宁斯大林民族政策的伟大成果。只要这种友谊存在，我们就不怕国内外的任何敌人。
    乌克兰人民、俄罗斯人民以及我们伟大祖国的其他各族人民，在与共产党和苏联政府紧密团结的情况下，来迎接乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年这个意义重大的节日。在各个加盟共和国之中，党组织、苏维埃组织和社会组织展开了庆祝的准备工作，向群众解释乌克兰与俄罗斯重新合并的历史意义。在佩雷雅斯拉夫议会三百周年的这一天——一九五四年一月十八日，在各企业、机关、学校、集体农庄、国营农场和机器拖拉机站，将举行关于乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年和我国各族人民之间的列宁斯大林的友谊的报告会和座谈会。各报章杂志以及广播节目都要纪念我们祖国历史上这个重要事件，并阐明苏联各族人民友谊的进一步巩固。
    有关乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年的群众政治工作，将从今年一月继续到五月。高等学校和科学机关准备在此期间召开专门会议和纪念会议。苏联科学院主席团要召开纪念乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年的科学院大会，并邀请乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国科学院代表团参加。乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国科学院将在基辅召开纪念会。
    五月份，在各企业、集体农庄、国营农场、机器拖拉机站、学校和机关，将举行劳动者的纪念大会。
    乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年是苏联各族人民的伟大民族节日，于今年五月将在全苏联庆祝。五月份，俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国最高苏维埃将在莫斯科举行纪念会，同时乌克兰苏维埃社会主义共和国最高苏维埃也在基辅举行纪念会。在其他各加盟共和国首都，均将举行庆祝大会。
    苏联各族人民，以经济和文化建设中新的卓越成就，以进一步巩固他们之间牢不可破的兄弟般的友谊来迎接这个意义重大的历史节日——乌克兰重新合并于俄罗斯三百周年。
    苏联各族人民的全部历史经验，显著地证明了他们与伟大的俄罗斯人民的友谊的重大意义，证明了我国各族人民兄弟联盟和紧密合作的不可战胜的力量。我国各族人民在共产党的领导之下，已经建成了社会主义，现在正满怀信心地向共产主义的胜利前进。
