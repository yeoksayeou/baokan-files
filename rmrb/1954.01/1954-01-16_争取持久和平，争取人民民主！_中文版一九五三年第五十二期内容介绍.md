The Chinese edition of "Strive for Lasting Peace, Strive for People's Democracy!", the organ of the Information Bureau of the Communist and Workers' Parties, No. 52, 1953, has been published.

This issue publishes an editorial entitled "The Indestructible Power of the Soviet State." The editorial points out: The Soviet state has never been as consolidated and powerful as it is today. The decisive condition for the invincibility of the Soviet social and state system lies in the leadership of the Communist Party. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union exposed the active participants in the traitor of the motherland and the imperialist secret agent Beria and his accomplices—the traitorous group of conspirators, giving a devastating blow to the conspiracy of the imperialist reactionaries. As long as all Communist and Workers' Parties and the entire working people can maintain the highest degree of vigilance, any conspiracy of international reactionaries and their agents will be crushed. The powerful Soviet people have already removed from their path the gang of traitors who attempted to prevent the Soviet Union from building communism and vainly tried to turn back the wheel of history. The Soviet state, full of creative power and vigorous energy, is confidently marching towards communism under the leadership of the Communist Party. Its power is invincible.

Important articles published in this issue include "Further Development of Czechoslovak Agriculture" by Ing. Uher, Deputy Prime Minister of the Czechoslovak Republic, and "The Italian Working People Struggle for Their Vital Needs" by Lei Bertosi, member of the Central Committee of the Italian Communist Party.

Ing. Uher's article points out: While resolutely implementing the national industrialization and continuing to develop the main foundation of the socialist economy—heavy industry, the Czechoslovak people are also paying more attention to developing those sectors of the national economy that contribute to a more rapid improvement in living standards. In this regard, agriculture is of particular importance. Therefore, the establishment and strengthening of unified agricultural cooperatives and state farms has become a necessary condition for continuously improving agricultural production and continuously improving the living standards of the working people. The article emphasizes: We are not satisfied and cannot be satisfied with the current level of agricultural production. We must launch a resolute struggle to increase the grain output and livestock productivity of all state farms, unified agricultural cooperatives, and individual farmers. Our primary task is to ensure the political, economic, and organizational consolidation of unified agricultural cooperatives. We must regard the establishment and consolidation of the material and technical basis of cooperative economy as one of the main tasks.

Lei Bertosi's article points out: The contradiction between the vast majority of the Italian working people, small business owners, and the ruling class is becoming increasingly apparent. The policy demanded by the working people is a policy of developing production, guaranteeing their labor rights and welfare. At present, the heroic struggle of workers in those enterprises threatened by shutdowns and production cuts, their efforts to maintain production, and the increasing impoverishment of the masses—these have deeply affected the broad masses of the people and those employees who are still hesitant about the struggle. The article says: In the struggle against cutting industrial production and striving to meet economic needs, we have made workers from Catholic parties, Social Democratic parties, and Republican parties take united action with us. The struggle of the Italian working people is not limited to striving for the realization of some current needs; it expresses the deeper and broader desire of the masses of the people to demand political, economic, and social reforms in the country.

    “争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”
     中文版一九五三年第五十二期内容介绍
    共产党和工人党情报局机关报“争取持久和平，争取人民民主！”中文版一九五三年第五十二期已经出版。
    本期以“苏维埃国家不可摧毁的威力”为题发表社论。社论指出：苏维埃国家从来没有像今天这样巩固和强大。苏维埃社会制度和国家制度的坚不可摧，其决定性的条件就在于有共产党的领导。苏联共产党揭露了祖国叛徒和帝国主义大特务贝利亚及其同谋犯——阴谋分子叛国集团的积极参加者，给了帝国主义反动派的阴谋一个毁灭性的打击。只要所有的共产党和工人党以及全体劳动人民都能保持最高度的警惕性，国际反动派及其代理人的任何阴谋都会被打得粉碎。强大的苏联人民已经从自己的道路上将企图阻止苏联的共产主义建设和妄想扭转历史车轮的叛徒匪帮清除出去了。充满着创造力量和充沛精力的苏维埃国家，正在共产党的领导下满怀信心地朝着共产主义迈进。它的力量是无敌的。
    本期刊载的重要文章有捷克斯洛伐克共和国副总理英·乌赫的“进一步发展捷克斯洛伐克的农业”，意大利共产党中央委员雷·贝托西的“意大利劳动人民为切身需要而斗争”。
    英·乌赫的文章指出：捷克斯洛伐克人民一方面坚持不渝地实行国家工业化，继续发展社会主义经济的主要基础——重工业，同时也更加注意发展那些有助于更迅速地提高生活水平的国民经济部门。在这方面，农业具有特别重大的意义。因此，建立和加强统一农业合作社和国营农场，就成为不断提高农业生产和不断提高劳动人民生活水平的一个必要条件。文章着重说：我们并不满足也不能满足于目前的农业生产水平。我们必须发动一个坚决的斗争，来提高所有的国营农场、统一农业合作社和个体农民的谷物产量和畜产品生产率。我们的首要任务是保证统一农业合作社在政治上、经济上和组织上的巩固。必须把建立和巩固合作社经济的物质—技术基础看成是主要的任务之一。
    雷·贝托西的文章指出：意大利绝大多数的劳动人民、小企业主与统治阶级之间的矛盾是一天天显著了。劳动人民所要求的政策是一种发展生产的政策，保障他们的劳动权利和福利的政策。目前，受着停工和削减生产威胁的那些企业里的工人的英勇斗争，他们为维持生产而作的努力，以及人民群众的日益穷困——这些都深深地影响了广大的人民群众以及那些对斗争还抱犹豫态度的职工。文章说：在反对削减工业生产、争取满足经济要求的斗争中，我们已经使得天主教党派、社会民主党和共和党的工人跟我们采取一致的行动。意大利劳动人民的斗争已不限于争取实现当前的一些需要，它表达了人民群众要求国家进行政治、经济和社会改革的更深刻、更广泛的愿望。
