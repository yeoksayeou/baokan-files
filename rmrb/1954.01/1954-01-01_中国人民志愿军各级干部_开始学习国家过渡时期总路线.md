    Cadres of All Levels in the Chinese People's Volunteer Army
    Begin Studying the General Line of the State During the Transition Period
    The cadres of all levels of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army have begun to study the general line and general task of the state during the transition period.
    When the leading organs of the Chinese People's Volunteer Army started their study, Zhang Nansheng, Deputy Director of the Political Department of the Volunteer Army, made a mobilization report on the study of the general line and general task of the state during the transition period. Responsible cadres of the Volunteer Army Headquarters and Political Department were organized into several senior study groups. The study group of the Headquarters was headed by the Deputy Chief of Staff, and the study group of the Political Department was headed by the Deputy Director Zhang Nansheng. Other cadres at all levels were also organized into study groups, with stipulated study times and established study systems, and began to study earnestly. Zhang Nansheng, Deputy Director of the Political Department, and Zeng Yanwei, Director of the Propaganda Department, also made mobilization reports on the study to some troop command organs.
    In order to facilitate the guidance of the study for all cadres, senior commanders of the central line Volunteer Army command organs and battalion and regimental cadres of various departments, organs, and troops began to study the general line and general task of the state during the transition period in early December. Senior cadres of all departments organized central study groups, with the secretary or deputy secretary of the CCP Committee at each level serving as the head of the study group, and stipulated that each participant in the central group study should submit a study reflection note or a study paper. In order to help other cadres study, after completing the study of a central issue, the central group, based on the conclusions of the discussion meeting and the spirit of the documents, made enlightening reports to the subordinate cadres in segments, focusing on the key points of the study, and then widely organized cadre discussions.
    The Volunteer Army command organs guarding the east coast of Korea also held a cadre study mobilization meeting on December 22. A member of the CCP Committee of the department made a mobilization report. After the report, cadres above the platoon level in the department were organized into classes, with stipulated study days, and a study system was established.

    中线志愿军指挥机关各高级指挥员和各部机关部队的营、团干部为便于指导所有干部的学习，在十二月上旬就提前开始了关于国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务的学习。各部高级干部都组织了中心学习组，以各级中共党委书记或副书记任学习组长，并规定参加中心组学习的学员，每人上交学习心得笔记或学习论文一篇。为了帮助其他干部学习，中心组在学完一个中心问题后，根据讨论会的结论和文件的精神，向所属干部将学习重点分段作启发报告，然后再广泛组织干部讨论。
    守卫在朝鲜东海岸的志愿军指挥机关也在十二月二十二日召开了干部学习动员大会，该部中共党委委员作了动员报告。报告后，该部排以上干部都编了班次，规定了学习日，并订出了学习制度。
