Thirty Years and Five Years (Part Two)
    —Before and After the Public-Private Partnership of Tangshan Huaxin Textile Company
    By Our Correspondent Wang Xi

    (III)
    From the day the socialist economic component participated in and led the Tangshan Huaxin Textile Company, the capitalist management methods inherited for thirty years were fundamentally abandoned, and its production began and became increasingly closely integrated with the national plan and the needs of the people. In 1949, the People's Government first solved the difficulty of the factory's lack of raw materials, enabling all the stopped spindles to start operating. Subsequently, the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company signed an exchange contract with the factory to exchange some finished products for raw cotton, enabling it to obtain a steady supply of raw cotton. Later, this contractual relationship developed into a complete processing arrangement, ensuring that the spindles and looms operated around the clock in three shifts, bringing the factory's full equipment capacity into play (with the exception of 1951, when production was reduced due to a national shortage of raw cotton). Taking just one product as an example, this year, the factory handed over 850,000 bolts of "Three Swallows" cloth to the National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company, which were allocated to all parts of the country. Eighty-five thousand bolts of cloth—calculated at sixteen feet per person—could provide more than five million farmers with clothing for a year.

    This opened a new era in the factory's operating history. Not to mention how the Japanese invaders used this factory to exploit cheap colonial labor during the Anti-Japanese War, how did the original owners of the factory operate it after the victory of the Anti-Japanese War? Mr. Li Mianzhi, the private shareholder and managing director of the company, recalled: "In the situation where the currency value changed several times a day, running a factory was like carrying a burden. No matter how much production improved, its profits were always far less than doing business in the cotton yarn and cloth market." At that time, the company's manager was stationed in the company's general office in Tianjin, fully engaged in commercial and speculative activities, taking advantage of loopholes to buy raw cotton, hoarding yarn and cloth to wait for high prices, and occasionally trading in gold bars and stocks. The so-called "factory" was just his "warehouse." No wonder the fine yarn workshop was exposed to the elements, with no one caring about the machines being exposed to wind and rain; no wonder the yarn workshop, which needed appropriate temperature and humidity, froze the workers' hands in winter; and no wonder fires in the factory became commonplace.
    "So, what was the profit situation at that time?" I asked the sales staff at the time.
    "In 1947, the factory accumulated relatively strong materials, and the trading was doing well. But at the beginning of 1948, trading became difficult. The Kuomintang reactionary government implemented 'price limits,' and the bureaucrats of Tangshan City came to the factory to snap up yarn and cloth at prices two or three times lower than the market price. Following this, the Kuomintang army also came. The Kuomintang Hebei Provincial Government even used the name of public shares to take away materials far exceeding its due share. The Kuomintang material investigation team falsely accused us of exceeding the 'price limit' regulations and detained the factory director, business operators, and three others under the name of 'economic criminals.' At this point, what was there to talk about profits?"
    After the public-private partnership, the operating methods were changed, and the separation of supply, production, and sales was eliminated, allowing the factory leadership to concentrate its efforts on educating and mobilizing employees to jointly manage production well. In recent years, the factory's profits have been increasing year by year. In 1949, the profit was 4.284 billion yuan; in 1950, it was 16.872 billion yuan; in 1951, it was 41.191 billion yuan; and in 1952, it was 66.738 billion yuan. The 1952 figure was more than 1,557 percent of that of 1949.
    The year-by-year increase in profits not only accumulated funds for the country and expanded the factory's production scale, but also enabled the capitalists to obtain increasing dividends year by year. Except for 1949, when the factory suffered from floods and had only just been restored, only maintenance fees were issued to shareholders. In previous years, profits were reasonably distributed among the four aspects of national income tax, enterprise public accumulation fund, worker welfare bonus, and capitalists' dividends and bonuses. In 1950, 9.6 billion yuan in dividends were distributed, and shareholders received an annual interest rate of 8 percent on their capital. In 1951, dividends and bonuses of 10.440 billion yuan were issued, with an annual interest rate of 8.7 percent. In 1952, dividends and bonuses of 14.4 billion yuan were issued, with an annual interest rate of 12 percent.
    The public-private partnership brought the capitalists of this company a profit rate that had never been seen in the capitalist era. In 1947, when the company's business was not bad, investors holding shares received 50,000 "legal tender" per share. Calculated according to the face value of the stock, the annual interest rate was 8 percent, but because the face value of the stock converted into "legal tender" was far lower than the value of the company's assets, the annual interest rate calculated according to the amount of capital was only 1 to 2 percent. In 1948, before liberation, the company tried its best to clear up the accumulated surplus and distributed as much as possible. At that time, each share was only distributed with five feet of indanthrene blue cloth. Estimated at the current price, the interest rate was about 1.8 percent. After the public-private partnership, the year with the highest profit rate reached 12 percent.
    In contrast, the joy of the private shareholders is not difficult to imagine. Some small shareholders had long forgotten about their shares and had lost contact with the old board of directors. Now, they all automatically found the board of directors and happily received their dividends and bonuses. In 1949, none of the private capitalist enterprises in the Tianjin and Tangshan areas paid dividends or bonuses to shareholders. Therefore, the news that the shareholders of Tangshan Huaxin Textile Company received maintenance fees was once widely praised by the capitalists. In 1950, the shareholders' share reached 8 percent of the capital, exceeding the highest interest rate (said to be about 7 percent) of the company's "golden age" before the Anti-Japanese War. This could not help but make Mr. Li Songchen, who had experienced several eras and was over 70 years old (now serving as a private shareholder supervisor), beam with joy and repeatedly praise. Mr. Li Mianzhi, the private shareholder and managing director of the company, is also a director of the private Qixin Cement Company and also runs Zhongtian Electric Factory. He made such a comparison to me: "In 1950, the shareholders of Qixin Cement Company only received maintenance fees of less than 1 percent, which only increased to 5 percent in 1951. Zhongtian Electric Factory was 3 percent in 1950."
    The increase in factory profits, coupled with the handling of sluggish materials in recent years, cleaning up the business stalls, and transferring the commercial circulating funds to production, has made it possible for the factory to carry out new expansions and build the necessary collective welfare facilities for the employees. In 1950, the long-overdue No. 2 yarn and cloth workshop was first built, and 482 looms were installed. In 1952, another 20,000 spindles were purchased. This nearly doubled the main equipment. With the increase in production equipment, the foundry was also renovated, a substation capable of holding 4,800 KV was built, the engineering team was expanded, and a small electric saw mill was added. Various safety and health equipment that had never existed in the decades since the factory was built were also renovated one after another in the past few years. Employee collective welfare facilities, from the small buildings of workers' dormitories to sanatoriums, from children's schools to nurseries, have all been built. It is worth mentioning that the canteen, which can accommodate a thousand people eating at the same time, has been praised as a model canteen in Hebei Province because of its good management in ensuring the time for workers to eat and the quality of food.
    Near the end of 1953, the company was preparing a five-year expansion plan for the future, expecting to rebuild a new factory with 30,000 spindles and 1,000 looms from the ground up - slightly larger than the scale of the factory 30 years ago.

    (IV)
    On major principle issues, full consultation between the public and private shareholder representatives of the Huaxin Textile Company board of directors ensured that the rights and interests of both public and private parties were mutually respected. The public shares representing the socialist economy in leading the company should be good at using consultation methods: put forward fair and reasonable opinions as the basis for consultation before consultation; and be good at making appropriate concessions without affecting the adherence to correct principles. This will make the consultation proceed smoothly and make the private shares actively participate in the operation. For example, the method of profit distribution each year is a question that the board of directors routinely discusses and decides every year, and it is also one of the issues that the private shares are most concerned about. Generally, before the board meeting, the public and private shareholder managing directors will first conduct discussions, and then widely solicit opinions from the private shareholder directors through the private shareholder managing directors. This will make the consultation of the meeting proceed smoothly and make the decisions of the meeting supported by both public and private parties. In 1949, when the company's profit situation was not good, the public shareholder director first proposed the idea of issuing maintenance fees to shareholders, which was agreed by the private shareholder representatives. In 1952, when the company's profits increased significantly compared to the previous year, the public shareholder director proposed that in accordance with the distribution principle of national income tax, enterprise public accumulation fund, employee welfare bonus, and shareholder dividends and bonuses, in order to facilitate the further expansion of the factory, the enterprise public accumulation fund should account for about 30% of the total profits, and guarantee that the shareholder dividends and bonuses will continue to increase compared to the previous year. After discussion and deliberation by all parties, the board of directors made a unanimous resolution. On the basis of the existing board of directors, if the frequent contact and consultation between the public and private managing directors are further established, it will play a greater role in giving full play to the enthusiasm of the private shareholder directors.
    The board of directors appointed three managers to be responsible for the daily management of the factory, two of whom were former agents of the capitalists: the first deputy manager was the director of the old board of directors office, and the second deputy manager was the former chief of the accounting section. Now, they are respectively in charge of the factory's basic construction and financial management.
    In order to facilitate consultations between the public and private parties and labor and management on major issues and reforms in factory management, a factory management committee was established in 1950. In addition to representatives elected by the workers, the president and vice presidents are also ex officio members. In recent months, the issues that the factory management committee has discussed include: monthly production plans, assessment, signing of collective contracts, cancellation of year-end double pay...
    The company's employees and technicians who originally served the interests of the capitalists, except for individual counter-revolutionaries, still shoulder the appropriate work that they are capable of after the public-private partnership. Among the more than 70 old employees, some of them are now serving as heads of the supply and marketing, labor and wages, planning, and technical inspection sections. The existing technical staff, except for a few, are all original. Employees and technicians here enjoy the same treatment as employees in other socialist enterprises, and the state gives them a broad field to fully display their talents. Among them, some are already members of the Communist Party of China.
    I visited several technicians from the chief engineer to the technicians. Without exception, they all expressed great interest in their work. Looking back on their work in the era of capitalist enterprises, they frequently shook their heads and said: In fact, they did not do anything practical. "Technicians, in addition to calculating the draft ratio when changing the yarn count, if they are willing to do something else, they can only pick up white flowers everywhere." "Use your ears to listen to what the workers are muttering, report to the superiors, and when you have nothing to do, pull open the drawer and kick your feet up" is the portrait they gave to their work. (Note: This is based on the writing of the word "职" - duty/position.)
    Hong Yizhi, the chief engineer in his fifties, has been serving here since 1927. He resigned when the Japanese invaders occupied the factory, and was detained by the Kuomintang government from the position of factory director after returning to the factory in 1945. He talked to me about his work in the past few years after the public-private partnership and said: "Last year, I was responsible for leading the installation of 20,000 new spindles. Although this work is not unfamiliar to me, the way of doing it is really different. I gradually understand the benefits of contacting the masses and consulting with everyone." When talking about the factory's five-year expansion plan for the future, he happily said that although he is sick, he still wants to participate in the new construction. From this old man, I found the fresh things that the new enterprise gave him.
    Chen Peng, the chief of the conservation section, entered the factory in 1947 as a foreman in the fine yarn workshop. He is very interested in machines. Not long after entering the factory, he discovered that he could modify several ordinary drafting machines into large drafting machines, thereby increasing the output of yarn. He happily ran to his superiors to discuss it. The engineer praised his discovery, but replied coldly: "If we want to modify this, we can't do it ourselves, and Tianjin (referring to the factory's leadership agency at the time) can't repair it for us either, so we have to go to Shanghai...." This meaningful discovery was shelved. "But," he told me, "not long after the public-private partnership, the factory leadership immediately supported my modification proposal and asked me to discuss it with the workers. Sure enough, this modification work was done very smoothly." From this small matter, he understood what kind of working conditions the socialist economy-led enterprise had prepared for him. He followed the direction pointed out to him by the leadership, faced the workshop, combined with the labor wisdom of the workers, and worked enthusiastically. Now, he is a model technician in the factory and also a glorious member of the Communist Party of China.
    From a foreman in a capitalist factory to a communist fighter, it is a truly leap forward progress for Chen Peng, and what is gratifying is that such progress is not unique to him; the conditions for achieving the same progress also exist for every employee and technician in the public-private partnership enterprise!
    Tangshan Huaxin Textile Company - under the light of the general line of the transition period in the people's country, is victoriously advancing on the road of state capitalism. It calls on its peers to follow in its footsteps and better complete their common historical tasks in the great era of the motherland's transition to socialism! (Attached picture)

    三十年和五年（下）
    ——唐山华新纺织公司公私合营前后
    本报记者　汪溪
    （三）
    从社会主义经济成份参加并领导了唐山华新纺织公司那一天起，便从根本上抛弃了三十年来因袭的资本主义经营方法，使它的生产开始并日益紧密地与国家计划和社会人民需要结合起来。一九四九年，人民政府先给它解决了原料供应缺乏的困难，使停止运转的纱锭，全部开动起来。接着，中国花纱布公司就和该厂订立了以部分成品交换原棉的交换合同，使它得到了原棉的源源供应。以后，这种合同关系又发展为全部加工性质，保证了纱锭、布机日夜三班不停地运转，发挥了全部的设备能力
  （其中只有一九五一年因全国原棉不足曾减产）。单以一项产品说，今年，这个工厂就以八十五万匹
  “三燕”布交给花纱布公司，分拨到全国各地。八十五万匹布—以每人以一丈六尺计算，可供五百多万农民一年穿用。
    这在工厂的经营史上，开辟了新纪元。且不说远在抗日战争时期，日寇怎样利用这个工厂榨取殖民地廉价的劳动力，就在抗日战争胜利之后，工厂原来的主人又是怎样经营的呢？公司的私股常务董事李勉之先生回忆说：“在当时币值一日数变的情况下，经营工厂就是背包袱，不管生产有多大改进，它的利润总是远远比不上在花纱布市场上做生意。”当时公司的经理就坐镇公司设在天津的总事务所里，全力从事商业和投机活动，钻空子买原棉，囤积起纱布等待高价，间或也做金条和股票的交易。所谓“工厂”只不过是他的“货栈”而已。怪不得细纱场露了天，任机器受风吹雨打无人过问，怪不得需要适当温湿度的纱场，冬天冻得工人伸不出双手，也怪不得场房里失火竟变成家常便饭了。
   “那末，那时盈利情况怎样呢？”我问当时的营业人员。
    “一九四七年工厂积存了比较雄厚的物资，买卖做得不错。但一九四八年初，买卖也难做了，国民党反动政府实行‘限价’，唐山市的官僚们就以低于市价二三倍的价钱来厂抢购纱布，跟着，国民党的军队也来了。国民党河北省政府更以公股名义，拉走了大大超过其应得分益的物资，国民党物资清查组更诬指我们超过‘限价’规定，把厂长、经营人员等三人加以‘经济犯’名义拘押走了。到了这种时候，还谈什么盈利？”
    公私合营之后，改换了经营方法，消除了供产销脱节的牵掣，使厂的领导集中力量教育并发动职工，共同管理好生产。几年来，工厂的盈利逐年都在增加着。一九四九年盈利四二·八四亿元，一九五○年为一六八·七二亿元，一九五一年为四一一·九一亿元，一九五二年为六六七·三八亿元。一九五二年为一九四九年的百分之一千五百五十七以上。
    盈利的逐年增加，不但为国家积累了资金，使工厂生产规模获得了扩展，也使资本家获得了逐年增多的分益。除一九四九年因工厂遭受水灾加以恢复不久，只发给股东维持费外，历年盈利，都是按照国家所得税、企业公积金、工人福利奖金及资本家的股息、红利四方面作了合理的分配。一九五○年分发股利九十六亿元，股东按其资本额获得了年利率百分之八的利润；一九五一年发给股息红利一○四·四○亿元，年利率百分之八·七；一九五二年股息红利一百四十四亿元，年利率百分之十二。
    公私合营给这个公司的资本家带来了在资本主义时代所没有过的利润率。在一九四七年，公司营业状况不坏的时候，持有股票的投资人，每股分到了五万元“法币”，按股票票面计算，年利率是百分之八，但由于股本折成“法币”算的票面额远低于公司财产的价值，因之按资本额计算，年利率也仅是百分之一至二。一九四八年解放之前，极力清理积余，把可能分配的尽量分配，当时每股也不过只分到五尺阴丹士林布，按现在价格估算，利率约为百分之一点八左右。而在公私合营后，利润率最高的一年已达到百分之十二了。
    两相对照，私股股东们的喜悦，是不难想见的。有些小股东，多年来早已把股票忘掉了，以致和旧董事会失去了联系的，现在，一个个都自动地找到董事会，高兴地领到了股息和红利。一九四九年，天津、唐山一带的私人资本主义企业没有一个给股东分股息和红利的，因而，唐山华新纺织公司的股东分到了维持费的消息，就曾被资本家们传颂一时。一九五○年，股东的分益达到了资本额的百分之八，超过了抗日战争时期以前公司的“黄金时代”的最高利率（据说是百分之七左右）这不禁使经历过几个时代的七十余高龄的李颂臣老先生（现在任私股监察人）笑逐颜开，连连称赞。公司私股常务董事李勉之先生，也是私营启新洋灰公司的董事，并兼营着中天电机厂，向我作了这样的比较：“一九五○年启新洋灰公司的股东，只分到了不及百分之一的维持费，到一九五一年才增到百分之五。中天电机厂，一九五○年是百分之三。”
    工厂盈利的增加，加之几年来处理呆滞物资，收拾起经营商业的摊子，把商业流动资金也转投入生产，就使工厂有可能进行了新的扩建，并为职工们兴造了必需的集体福利设施。一九五○年先修建了年久失修的第二纱布场房，安装了四八二台织布机。一九五二年又增购了两万纱锭。这样就使主要设备扩大了将近一倍。随着生产设备的增加，也增修了翻砂场，能容四千八百KV的变电站，扩大了工程队，增设了小型电锯场。建厂数十年来从未有的各种安全卫生设备也在几年内陆续装修起来。职工的集体福利设施从工人宿舍的小楼到休养所，从子弟学校到托儿所，都兴建起来了。值得特别一提的是那个可同时容千人吃饭的食堂，因为管理得好，在保证工人吃饭的时间及饭食的质量上都有突出的成绩，曾被评选为河北省的模范食堂。
    在一九五三年将近结束的时候，公司正在拟制今后五年扩建计划，预期将要陆续从平地上重新修建一座拥有三万纱锭和一千台布机的新厂——略大于三十年前这座工厂的规模。
          （四）
    在重大的原则问题上，公私合营华新纺织公司董事会公私股代表进行充分协商，就保证了公私双方的权益得到相互尊重。代表社会主义经济进行领导的公股，要善于运用协商的方法：在协商之前提出公平合理的意见，作为协商的基础；在不影响坚持正确原则的情况下，又能善于作适当的让步，这样就能使协商进行得顺利，并使私股积极于参加经营。譬如每年利润的分配方法是董事会每年照例要讨论决定的问题，也是私股方面最关心的问题之一。一般地，在董事会开会之前，公私股常务董事均预先进行酝酿，又经由私股常务董事在私股董事中广泛征求意见，这样就可使会议的协商顺利进行，并使会议的决定，为公私双方所拥护。在一九四九年公司盈利情况不大好时，公股董事方面首先提出了给股东发维持费的意见，取得了私股代表的同意。一九五二年公司盈利较上年增加很多时，公股董事提出了在按照国家所得税、企业公积金、职工福利奖金、股东股息红利四方面分配原则下，为利于工厂进一步扩建而使企业公积金占到全部盈利百分之三十左右，并保证股东的股息红利较上一年继续增加的分配意见，经过各方面的酝酿讨论，董事会才作了一致通过的决议。在现有的董事会的基础上，如果进一步建立公私常务董事经常的联系和协商，这对于充分发挥私股董事的积极性会起更大的作用的。
    董事会任命了三位经理，负责主持工厂的日常管理，其中两个副经理都是原来的资方代理人：第
  一副经理是旧董事部的办公室主任，第二副经理是原会计科长，现在，他们分别掌管着工厂的基本建设和财务经营两个方面。
    为了便于公、私双方和劳资之间对于工厂管理的重大问题和兴革事项进行协商，一九五○年成立了工厂管理委员会。除由职工选举代表参加外，正副经理均为当然委员。最近几个月工厂管理委员会曾经讨论过的问题有：月生产计划、查定、集体合同的签订，取消年终双薪……。
    原来服务于资本家利益的公司职员和技术人员，在公私合营之后，除个别反革命分子外，仍担负着其力能胜任的适当工作。在七十余个旧有的职员中，现在有些分别担任了供销、劳动工资、计划、技术检查科的科长职务。现有的技术人员，除少数外，都是原有的。职员和技术人员在这里享受着与其他社会主义企业的职工相同的待遇，国家给予他们以充分发挥其才能的广阔的园地。他们之中，有的已经是中国共产党的党员了。
    我访问过从总工程师到技师好几位技术人员。他们都无例外地表示了对工作的莫大兴趣。他们回顾在资本主义企业时代的工作，都频频摇头说：实在的，他们是不作什么实际事情的。“技师，除了在改变纺纱支数时，算算牵伸倍数以外，如果还愿意干点什么的话，就只有到处去拣白花了。”“用耳去听工人在叨咕什么，用口向上级报告，闲来无事，拉开抽屉两脚向上一跷”是他们给自己所作的工作写照。（按：这是根据“职”字写法而来的。）
    五十多岁的总工程师洪挹之，从一九二七年就在这里服务。日寇占领这个工厂时告退了，一九四五年重新回厂后曾被国民党政府从厂长的职位上拘押走。他向我谈叙公私合营后几年来的工作说：“去年负责领导安装两万枚新纱锭，这样的工作对我虽不生疏，但做法真不同了。我渐渐懂得了联系群众、找大家商量的好处。”谈到工厂今后五年扩建计划时，他愉快地表示，虽然身体多病，还是要参加新的建设的。从这位老人的身上，我找到了新的企业赋予他的新鲜东西。
    保全科长陈鹏是一九四七年进厂当细纱车间领班的。他对机器很有兴趣。进厂不久后，他发现可以把几部普通牵伸车改装为大牵伸车，从而可以提高纱的产量。他高兴地跑去找上级商量。工程师嘉许了他的发现，但却冷淡地回答他：“要改装这个，咱们自己不行，天津（指当时工厂的领导机关）也不能给咱们修，还得到上海……。”这件有意义的发现就被拦置下了。“可是，”他告诉我说，“公私合营后不久，厂的领导方面便马上支持我的改装意见，叫我拿去和工人商量。果然，这件改装工作很顺当地就办好了。”从这件不算大的事情上，他懂得了社会主义经济领导的企业给他准备了怎末样的工作条件。他遵循着领导方面给他指出的方向，面向车间，和工人的劳动智慧相结合，热情地工作着。现在，他是厂里的模范技术人员，也是光荣的中国共产党党员了。
    从资本主义工厂的领班到共产主义的战士，对陈鹏来说真是飞跃的进展，而可喜的是，这样的进展并不是他一个人所独有；获得同样进展的条件，对公私合营企业的每个职员和技术人员，也是同样存在着的！
    唐山华新纺织公司——在人民国家过渡时期总路线的照耀下，在国家资本主义的道路上胜利地前进着。它召唤着他的同辈，追随他的脚步，在祖国过渡到社会主义的伟大时代中，更好地完成其共同的历史任务！（附图片）
