Xinhua News Agency, 7th: The North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China recently issued a circular introducing the experiences of Tangshan, Zhangjiakou, and Fengfeng Mining Area in Hebei Province in organizing worker慰問团 (comfort groups) to visit the countryside, and requested party committees in various places to be good at seizing various opportunities for workers and peasants to meet and continuously carry out education on the worker-peasant alliance.

Last September, seven cities including Tangshan and Zhangjiakou in Hebei Province, four special districts including Cangxian County, and the Fengfeng Mining Area organized ten worker 慰問团(comfort groups) one after another, wading through mud and water to visit the rain-flooded rural areas of Hebei. This visit took a variety of forms. The worker 慰問团(comfort groups) went deep into households, to the fields, and held forums with farmers. Many workers also helped farmers salvage autumn crops. The farmers were very touched. When the farmers near villages heard the news of the forums held by the 慰問团(comfort groups), they came to participate voluntarily. Through the education of the forums, the farmers' understanding of the worker-peasant alliance was further deepened. Zhao Yupei, a farmer in Fengnan County, said: "In the past, I only knew that workers could not do without peasants, but now I know that peasants cannot do without workers even more. Without workers, we can't even use a small hoe, let alone a tractor." Farmers in Chajiapu, Fengnan County, decided to grow more wheat and cotton to support industrial construction. The farmers still remembered this visit. After the workers of the 慰問团(comfort groups) returned to the factory, they also received letters from the farmers encouraging them to increase production.

The North China Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China emphasized in the circular: The material exchange exhibitions held in North China in 1951, the organization of agricultural labor models to visit factories in various places, and the use of various opportunities to organize worker-peasant forums have repeatedly proved that they have had a great effect on changing farmers' understanding of the working class and further strengthening the worker-peasant alliance. The circular instructed party committees in various places to pay constant attention to strengthening this aspect of work in the propaganda of the general line in the future. It is necessary to enable the broad masses of peasants to understand the leading role of the working class and the significance of the worker-peasant alliance, understand that only by further consolidating the worker-peasant alliance can we build our country into a great socialist country and enable the broad masses of peasants to take the socialist road and achieve common prosperity; understand the leading role of industrial production in national construction and the important position of agricultural production in national construction, and that peasants taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation to increase grain and cotton production is a glorious contribution to the country. The instruction pointed out: All localities must use various opportunities for workers and peasants to meet, such as visits and vacations, to organize a variety of forums, where farmers report on agricultural production increases and mutual aid and cooperation, and workers talk about urban industrial construction, so that both sides can receive practical education, and the relationship between workers and peasants is as close as the relationship between soldiers and civilians in wartime, encouraging both sides to further consolidate the worker-peasant alliance, support each other, develop production, and strive to build a great socialist country.

    中共中央华北局指示各级党委
    加强进行工农联盟的教育
    【新华社七日讯】中共中央华北局不久以前发出通报，介绍河北省唐山、张家口和峰峰矿区组织工人慰问团到农村访问的经验，并要求各地党委善于抓紧各种工农见面的机会，不断进行工农联盟的教育。
    去年九月，河北省唐山、张家口等七个市，沧县等四个专区及峰峰矿区，曾先后组织了十个工人慰问团，淌泥涉水到雨涝了的河北农村进行访问。这次访问采取多种多样的形式。工人慰问团曾深入到户、到场边和农民召开座谈会。许多工人还帮助农民打捞秋禾。农民们非常感动。慰问团召开的座谈会，附近村庄农民闻讯，自动赶来参加。经过座谈会的教育，使农民对工农联盟的理解更加深刻。丰南县农民赵玉佩说：“过去只知道工人离不开农民，现在才知道农民更离不开工人，离开工人连个小锄头也使不上，更不用说拖拉机了”。丰南县查家铺的农民决定要多种小麦和棉花，支援工业建设。农民们念念不忘这次访问，慰问团的工人回厂后，还收到农民勉励他们增加生产的信件。
    中共中央华北局在通报中着重指出：一九五一年在华北各地开过的物资交流展览会，和各地组织农业劳动模范参观工厂，利用各种机会组织工农座谈等经验，多次证明它在改变农民对工人阶级的认识，与进一步加强工农联盟方面都发生了很大效果。通报指示各地党委今后在进行总路线宣传中，更要经常注意加强这方面的工作。要使广大农民了解工人阶级的领导作用及工农联盟的意义，懂得只有进一步巩固工农联盟，才能把我们的国家建设成一个伟大的社会主义国家，才能使广大农民走社会主义的道路而达到大家富裕；懂得工业生产在国家建设中的领导作用和农业生产在国家建设中的重要位置，农民走互助合作道路增产粮、棉，是对国家的光荣贡献。指示指出：各地必须利用参观、休假等各种工农见面的机会，组织多种多样的座谈会，由农民报告农业增产和互助合作情形，由工人讲述城市工业建设，使双方都受到实际教育，作到工农之间如同在战争中的军民关系那样亲切，鼓舞双方为进一步巩固工农联盟，互相支援，发展生产，建设伟大的社会主义国家而努力。
