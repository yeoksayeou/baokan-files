Trade and Cooperation in the Pastoral Areas of Inner Mongolia, Suiyuan, and Northwest
　　Li Zonghai, Wan Tao

The vast pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, Suiyuan, and Northwest China are mostly inhabited by ethnic minorities. These regions breed large numbers of livestock each year and produce a significant amount of animal products. Livestock and these products are needed for industrial and agricultural production and the lives of urban people. On the other hand, pastoral areas lack industrial and agricultural products—various means of production and means of subsistence needed for pastoral production. This dictates the need to vigorously develop trade and cooperation in pastoral areas.

Under the general policy of "developing production and promoting economic prosperity," the People's Government has established many state-owned trading companies, supply and marketing cooperatives, and mobile trading teams, adapting to the characteristics of the pastoral areas such as their vastness, the dispersed settlement of herders, and their frequent nomadic movements. It has also cultivated a large number of ethnic minority trade cadres. In recent years, the trade and cooperation in pastoral areas has greatly developed. By 1952, Suiyuan, Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai, Xinjiang and other provinces had established a total of 152 state-owned trading companies. According to incomplete statistics from pastoral areas in Inner Mongolia, Suiyuan, Xinjiang, Qinghai, Ningxia and other places in June 1953, there were more than 460 supply and marketing cooperatives at all levels, with more than 431,525 members, and a total capital of 28 billion yuan. In the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, supply and marketing cooperatives have been established from Hulunbuir on the northern border to the pastoral areas of Xilin Gol League and Chahar League in the west, and in the Greater Khingan Mountains where the Oroqen hunters live. The mobile trading teams in various pastoral areas have also developed rapidly and are now spread like a network across the vast grasslands.

Under the guidance of the Party's economic and ethnic policies, these state-owned trading companies, supply and marketing cooperatives, and mobile trading teams vigorously purchase livestock products from herders and supply essential production and living goods. From 1950 to 1952, the Qinghai Provincial State-Owned Trading Company invested more than 300.2 billion yuan in purchasing wool, hides, casings, and other by-products. In 1952, the Xinjiang State-Owned Trading Company purchased 1,825,790 jin of various animal hairs and 1,866,050 animal hides of various types. From January to September 1953 alone, the state-owned trading companies and cooperatives in Inner Mongolia and Suiyuan purchased more than 10 million jin of sheep wool, goat wool, camel hair, cashmere and more than 400,000 cattle hides from the pastoral areas of various leagues and banners. These hides and wools are mostly transported to Northeast and North China for use as industrial raw materials. The Meng-Sui region also exported more than 30,000 cattle and horses through state-owned trading organizations to supplement draught animals in rural areas throughout the country; and exported 100,000 sheep for people to eat. The large quantities of milk purchased by various trade organizations are processed by local factories into butter, milk powder, casein, and lactose for sale throughout the country. In addition, a large amount of grain and feed were supplied to the pastoral areas, strongly supporting livestock production. With grain to eat, herders greatly reduced the slaughter of livestock.

In the process of exchanging industrial, agricultural, and livestock products, the supply and marketing cooperatives in various pastoral areas have also played a significant role. For example, the Hulunbuir League Pastoral Area Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has purchased livestock and furs worth a total of 26.2 billion yuan for state-owned trading companies in the four years since its establishment. In the first quarter of 1953, the original plan was to purchase 1.01 million jin of wool, but the actual completion exceeded the original plan by 6 percent. The original plan was to purchase 2,920 cattle, but the actual purchase exceeded the original plan by 82 percent. The cooperative is not only a capable assistant to state-owned trading organizations, not only an indispensable component for solving the production and living needs of herders, but also, under the leadership of and in close cooperation with state-owned trading departments, plays an important role in gradually guiding the vast number of herders towards the path of cooperation.

The smooth development of trade and cooperation in pastoral areas is primarily due to the fact that trade and cooperation departments in various regions have implemented a policy of equivalent exchange in their work, rationally adjusting the price ratios of industrial, agricultural, and livestock products, so that herders can sell livestock products and buy back industrial and agricultural products at reasonable prices. For example, before liberation, 100 jin of wool in Qinghai Province could only be exchanged for one and a half packages of Fu Brick Tea, or 85 jin of wheat, or 1 zhang 9 chi of blue cloth; now it can be exchanged for 34.5 to 37.5 packages of Fu Brick Tea, or 1,161 jin of wheat, or about 5 bolts of blue cloth. In the pastoral areas of Inner Mongolia, 1 jin of wool could only be exchanged for 1 jin of millet in 1947, and 1 sheep could only be exchanged for 1 package of raw tobacco, while now 1 jin of wool can be exchanged for 10 jin of millet, and 1 sheep can be exchanged for 15 packages of raw tobacco. This has increased the income of herders, increased the purchasing power of herders, and stimulated the enthusiasm of herders for livestock production. Secondly, in view of the extremely dispersed and frequently mobile characteristics of pastoral areas, trade companies, supply and marketing cooperatives, and mobile trade teams and other institutions closely cooperate with each other and adopt flexible methods to exchange products with herders. At the same time, they also make full use of herders' accustomed gathering occasions (such as the Nadaam conference and other temple fairs) to conduct extensive transactions with herders. Around the Qingming Festival for forty days, when herders are vigorously fighting disasters and receiving lambs, lambing tools are supplied. In addition, a large number of ethnic minority trade cadres have been trained. They are easy to approach by herders of their own ethnicity, have no language barriers, and can deeply understand the needs of herders of their own ethnicity in life and production. Therefore, when supplying various utensils and daily necessities for life and production, they can meet the needs of livestock production and the preferences of herders.

The development of trade and cooperation in pastoral areas has stimulated the development of livestock production. With the development of production, the increase and popularity of livestock prices have effectively increased the income of herders, increased the purchasing power of herders, and improved the lives of herders. Taking Ulanqab League in Suiyuan Province as an example, the total turnover at the Nadaam conference in June 1953 reached 2.846 billion yuan in seven days, exceeding the original plan by nearly one-half and more than three times the total turnover at the Nadaam conference in 1950. According to the understanding of the Trade Team of Dulan County, Qinghai Province in Qumalai, about 80 percent of the herders have added new clothes, about 60 percent of the herders have eaten highland barley, 30 percent of the herders have eaten noodles, 10 percent of the herders have eaten rice, and it is more common to be able to drink Fu Brick Tea. Now herders in pastoral areas generally wear new clothes, and many places require the establishment of schools.

In the past few years, trade and cooperation in pastoral areas has achieved great results, but there are still many shortcomings in the work. In some areas, individual trade departments have not purchased livestock products in a timely manner, and the supply of necessities for herders is far from meeting the needs of herders. The supply plan is also not entirely in line with the actual needs of pastoral areas. Some areas do not have a sufficient understanding of the role of supply and marketing cooperatives in the pastoral economy and state-owned trade. In places where conditions for developing supply and marketing cooperation are available, they do not pay enough attention to establishing cooperatives, or even if they have established supply and marketing cooperatives, they lack regular support and leadership; there are also some areas that violate the principle of voluntariness and force the masses to join the cooperatives, regardless of the masses' awareness and conditions. There are also trade departments in some areas that have not grasped the characteristics of pastoral areas, and like in agricultural areas, they are fixed in one place, waiting to purchase, mechanically emphasizing business hours. Some trade departments have not established a system of clearly marked prices, and even weights and measures are not unified, which increases the difficulty of trading with herders. These shortcomings need to be improved in the future.

Our country has entered a period of planned economic construction, and livestock production is a part of the national economic construction. We must correctly understand the important role of trade and cooperation in developing livestock production and strengthen this work. In the past, although trade and cooperation in pastoral areas has developed greatly, judging from the situation in some pastoral areas, both public and private businesses still feel inadequate. Therefore, it is necessary to appropriately expand state-owned trade in pastoral areas. Supply and marketing cooperatives should be consolidated as the main task. In areas where cooperatives have not yet been established, they should be established in a planned manner in key areas where conditions are better and leadership can take care of them.

    内蒙古、绥远及西北牧业区的贸易合作事业
    李宗海　宛　涛
    我国内蒙古、绥远及西北的广大牧业区绝大部分是少数民族聚居区。在这些地区，每年繁殖着大量的牲畜，出产着大量的畜产品。牲畜和这些畜产品是工农业生产和城市人民生活所需要的。另一方面，牧业区又很缺乏工农业产品——牧业生产所需要的各种生产资料和生活资料。这就决定了在牧业区必需大力开展贸易合作事业。
    人民政府在“发展生产、繁荣经济”的总方针下，适应牧业区的地区辽阔、牧民居住分散而又经常游动等特点，建立了很多国营贸易公司、供销合作社和贸易流动小组，并培养出大批少数民族贸易干部。几年来，牧业区贸易合作事业有了很大的发展。绥远、甘肃、宁夏、青海、新疆等省，到一九五二年共成立了国营贸易公司一百五十二个。根据内蒙古、绥远、新疆、青海、宁夏等地牧业区一九五三年六月份不完整的统计，已建立的各级供销合作社共达四百六十余个，拥有社员四十三万一千五百二十五人，共有资金二百八十亿元。内蒙古牧业区从北部边疆的呼伦贝尔，到西部锡林郭勒盟、察哈尔盟的牧业区，以及鄂伦春猎民们所散居的大兴安岭，都已建立了供销合作社。各个牧业区的贸易流动小组发展得也很快，已像网络一样满布在广阔的草原上。
    这些国营贸易公司、供销合作社、贸易流动小组，在党的经济政策和民族政策指导下，大力地收购牧民畜产品和供应生产、生活必需品。青海省国营贸易公司从一九五零年到一九五二年的三年中，因收购羊毛、皮张、肠衣和其他副产品，共投放人民币三千零二亿多元。新疆国营贸易公司在一九五二年收购了各种畜毛一百八十二万五千七百九十斤，各种畜皮一百八十六万六千零五十张。内蒙古和绥远的国营贸易公司和合作社仅在一九五三年一月至九月份就收购了各盟旗牧业区出产的绵羊毛、山羊毛、驼毛、羊绒等共一千多万斤和牛皮四十多万张。这些皮张、毛绒多运往东北华北各地供作工业原料。蒙绥地区还通过国营贸易机构输出了三万多头牛、马供各地农村添补耕畜；输出十万只羊供各地人民食用。各贸易机构所收购的大批牛奶，则由当地加工厂制成奶油、乳粉、酪胶和乳糖运销全国各地。此外，对牧业区供应了大批粮食、饲养料等，有力地支援了畜牧业生产。牧民有了粮食吃，牲畜的宰杀就大大减少了。
    在工农牧产品交换的过程中，各牧业区的供销合作社也起了很大作用。如内蒙古自治区呼纳盟牧业区供销合作社成立四年来，为国营贸易公司收购了总值二百六十二亿元的牲畜和皮毛。一九五三年第一季度原计划收购羊毛一百零一万斤，实际完成量超过原计划百分之六。原计划购牛二千九百二十头，实际收购超过原计划百分之八十二。合作社不仅是国营贸易机构的得力助手，不仅是解决牧民生产、生活需要不可缺少的组成部分，而且在国营贸易部门的领导与密切配合下，对逐步引导着广大牧民走向合作的道路起着重要的作用。
    牧业区贸易合作事业能够顺利地开展，首先是由于各地贸易合作部门在工作中贯彻了等价交换的政策，合理地调整了工、农、牧产品的比价，使牧民能够以合理价格出售畜产品和买回工、农产品。如解放前在青海省一百斤羊毛只能换茯茶一封半，或小麦八十五斤，或青斜布一丈九尺；现在却能换到茯茶三十四封半到三十七封半，或小麦一千一百六十一斤，或青斜布约五匹。内蒙古牧业区在一九四七年一斤羊毛只能换一斤小米，一只绵羊只能换一包生烟，而现在一斤羊毛却能换到十斤小米，一只绵羊能换到十五包生烟了。因此增加了牧民的收入，提高了牧民的购买力，刺激了牧民对畜牧业生产的积极性。其次，针对牧业区极度分散而又经常游动等特点，贸易公司、供销合作社、贸易流动小组等机构，密切地配合起来，采取灵活的方式，对牧民进行产品交换。同时还充分利用牧民所习惯的集会场合（如那达慕大会和其他庙会）与牧民进行广泛的交易。清明前后四十天，牧民大力抗灾接羔时，就供应接羔工具。此外，还培养了大批的少数民族贸易干部。他们与本民族牧民容易接近，没有语言的隔阂，能够深刻了解本民族牧民的生活和生产中的要求，因此，在供应各种用具和生活、生产必需品时，能够作到适合于畜牧业生产的需要与牧民的喜爱。
    牧业区贸易合作事业的开展，刺激了畜牧业生产的发展，随着生产的发展，畜产品价格的提高和畅销，有效地增加了牧民的收入，提高了牧民的购买力，改善了牧民生活。以绥远省乌兰察布盟为例，在一九五三年六月那达慕大会上，七天中成交总额达二十八亿四千六百余万元，超过原计划将近二分之一，超过一九五○年那达慕大会上的成交总额三倍以上。又据青海省都兰县贸易小组在曲麻莱一地的了解，添置新衣的牧民约占百分之八十左右，有百分之六十的牧民吃上了青稞，百分之三十的牧民吃上了挂面，百分之十的牧民吃上了大米，能够喝到茯茶的更为普遍。现在牧业区的牧民都普遍穿新戴新了，并有很多地方的牧民要求建立学校。
    在过去的几年中，牧业区贸易合作事业已取得了很大的成绩，但工作中还存在着不少的缺点。有些地区的个别贸易部门对畜产品收购不够及时，对牧民必需品的供应也远远赶不上牧民的需要，供应计划与牧区实际需要也不尽符合。有些地区对供销合作社在牧业经济中和国营贸易中所起的作用认识不够，在具备了发展供销合作条件的地方，对建社也不够重视，或者虽然建立了供销合作社，也缺乏经常的扶助和领导；还有些地区，不顾群众的觉悟和条件，违犯自愿原则，强迫群众入社。还有些地区的贸易部门没有掌握牧业区的特点，像在农业区一样，固定在一个地方，坐等收购，机械地强调营业时间。还有的贸易部门没有建立明码售货制度，甚至连度量衡也不统一，增加了与牧民交易的困难。这些缺点都需要今后努力改进。
    我国已进入有计划的经济建设时期，畜牧业生产是全国经济建设的一部分。我们必须正确认识贸易合作事业在发展畜牧业生产中的重要作用，加强这一工作。过去，牧业区贸易合作事业虽然有了很大的开展，但就若干牧区情况看，无论公私营商业还都感到不足。因此，在牧业区必须适当扩大国营贸易事业。供销合作社则应以巩固为主。目前还没有建立合作社的地区，应有计划地在条件较好、领导上能顾到的地方重点创办。
