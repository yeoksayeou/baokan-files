Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 28th: Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao, representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, sent a letter to Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission (NNRC) on the 28th regarding the handling of prisoners of war in the North Camp. The full text of the letter is as follows:

To Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission:

I have the honor to acknowledge receipt of your letter dated January 27, 1954.

I would like to reiterate our position that the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army resolutely cannot agree to accept the prisoners of war held in the northern prisoner-of-war camp. We believe that the Indian forces should not only not return these prisoners of war, but should continue to guard them, because the Indian forces will soon be leaving Korea entirely. Furthermore, the prisoners of war in the northern prisoner-of-war camp have publicly expressed to you their refusal to be repatriated and have requested the right to reside in our area. Our side agrees that the North Korean-Chinese Red Cross will accept these prisoners of war, so that both parties to the Korean Armistice Agreement can provide a satisfactory explanation and resolution when discussing the prisoner-of-war issue at future Korean political conferences or other relevant international conferences.

I will notify the representatives of the North Korean-Chinese Red Cross to arrive at the Songgok-ri camp in the northern part of the Demilitarized Zone at 10:00 AM on January 28, 1954, to complete the handover of 347 prisoners of war with the Indian Red Cross.

Korean People's Army and Chinese People's Volunteer Army Representative, Lieutenant General of the Korean People's Army, Li Xiangchao.

January 28, 1954

Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 28th: Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao, representative of the Korean People's Army and the Chinese People's Volunteer Army, sent a letter to Lieutenant General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission on January 26th, requesting that the Indian Custodial Forces hand over the 347 American prisoners of war who refused repatriation, along with their lists, documents, and other items, to the North Korean-Chinese Red Cross on January 28th. Thimayya replied to Lieutenant General Li Xiangchao on January 27th, stating that the Indian Custodial Forces could no longer participate in any transfer procedures and only agreed that representatives of the Indian Red Cross would transfer the list of prisoners of war to the North Korean-Chinese Red Cross.

Thimayya's letter stated: The Indian Custodial Forces withdrew their custody of the prisoners of war in the North Camp on January 23rd. "Regarding your request that the Indian Custodial Forces transfer the prisoners of war, along with their lists, identification documents, and personal belongings, to the Red Cross of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China, I wish to emphasize that since the prisoners of war are no longer under the custody of the Indian Custodial Forces, the Indian Custodial Forces cannot participate in any further transfer procedures. In fact, the authority of the Indian Custodial Forces to participate in any such action ceased when it relinquished its custodial duties."

Thimayya said: "However, to meet the needs of the situation, I agree to request that representatives of the Indian Red Cross transfer the list, including the names and other materials of the prisoners of war, to the personnel of the Red Cross of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China. These lists are the only documents that the Indian Custodial Forces obtained from your side while they were in charge of guarding the prisoners of war.

If you agree, representatives of the Indian Red Cross will meet with personnel from the Red Cross of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China at the Songgok-ri prisoner-of-war camp in the northern part of the Demilitarized Zone at 10:00 AM on January 28, 1954."

　　李相朝中将就北营战俘的处理问题致函蒂迈雅
　　我方同意由朝中红十字会接受北营战俘
    【新华社开城二十八日电】朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表李相朝中将二十八日就北营战俘的处理问题致函中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将，信的全文如下：中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅中将：
    我荣幸地收到你一九五四年一月二十七日的来信。
    我愿意在此重申我方立场，朝鲜人民军和中国人民志愿军坚决不能同意接受看管北部战俘营中的战俘，我方认为印度部队不仅不应交还，而且还应继续看管这些战俘，因为印度部队不久即将全部离开朝鲜，而北部战俘营中的战俘又已公开向你表示拒绝遣返，并要求朝中方面给予居留的权利，我方同意由朝中红十字会接受这批战俘，以便朝鲜停战缔约双方在将来的朝鲜政治会议或其他有关国际会议上讨论战俘问题时作出满意的交代和解决。
    我将通知朝中红十字会代表于一九五四年一月二十八日十时到达非军事区北部松谷里营场与印度红十字会办理三百四十七名战俘接交事宜。
      朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表 朝鲜人民军中将  李相朝
               一九五四年一月二十八日
    【新华社开城二十八日电】朝鲜人民军与中国人民志愿军代表李相朝中将曾在一月二十六日致函中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅，要求印度看管部队将拒绝遣返的三百四十七名美方战俘连同他们的名册、证件及其他物品，在一月二十八日点交朝中红十字会。蒂迈雅于一月二十七日复函李相朝中将，认为印度看管部队不能再参加任何移交程序，仅同意由印度红十字会代表将战俘名单移交给朝中红十字会。
    蒂迈雅的信说：印度看管部队已在一月二十三日撤退了对北营战俘的看管。“你要求印度看管部队将战俘连同他们的名单、证明文件和私人财物一起移交给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国的红十字会一事，我愿强调说，由于战俘已不再处于印度看管部队看管之下，印度看管部队不可能再参加任何移交的程序，事实上印度看管部队参与任何此项行动的权力已在它放弃了其看管职司之时终止了。”
    蒂迈雅说：“但是为了迎合形势之需要，我同意要求印度红十字会的代表将包括了战俘的姓名与其他材料的名单移交给朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国的红十字会。这些名单是印度看管部队在他们担任看管战俘时得自你方的唯一的文件。
    如果你同意，印度红十字会的代表将于一九五四年一月二十八日十时在非军事区北部的松谷里战俘营和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国和中华人民共和国的红十字会人员相会晤。”
