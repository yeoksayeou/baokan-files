    Liuba County Cooperative Federation
    Untimely Supply of Farm Tools
    Reader Luo Xingtai's letter: In May 1953, seven farming households in the Second Village of Xiaoliuba Township, Liuba County, Shaanxi Province, obtained agricultural loans of 210,000 yuan from the People's Bank to purchase weeding hoes through the Liuba County Cooperative Federation (hereinafter referred to as the County Federation). After the farmers completed the loan procedures, they all hoped that the County Federation would distribute the weeding hoes as soon as possible. However, they waited and waited, but did not receive any notice from the County Federation. Seeing that the weeds in the cornfields were growing deeper than the corn seedlings, these farmers who were waiting for weeding hoes were so anxious that they went to the County Federation four times in a row. Each time, they only saw a few unusable rotten weeding hoes at the County Federation. When they asked the comrades of the County Federation, they always said, "Don't worry, they will be here in a few days!" This continued until the weeding was over, and the hoes still had not arrived. Farmer Hu Zhangyun was so angry that he went to the bank to cancel the loan contract. The bank comrades said, "We have already transferred the account. You should wait for the County Federation to have hoes and then go to collect them!"
    After these farmers harvested the corn and brought it home, the County Federation distributed the weeding hoes on November 30th. The farmers had many complaints. Some said, "Now that the corn has been harvested, what am I going to do with this!"

    留坝县合作社联合社
    供应农具太不及时
    读者罗兴泰来信：一九五三年五月间，陕西留坝县小留坝乡二村有七户农民向人民银行贷了二十一万元农业贷款，由留坝县合作社联合社（以下简称县联社）代购薅锄。农民们把贷款手续办好后，都盼望县联社早些把薅锄发下来。可是眼睛都望穿了，还没见县联社来通知。眼看玉米地里的草长得比玉米苗还深了，这些等薅锄用的农民急得没法，一连到县联社去了四次，每次看到县联社只有几把不能用的烂薅锄；问县联社的同志，他们总说：“不要急，等几天就来了！”就这样一直等到草都薅过了，锄头还是不见来。农民胡章云气得到银行去取消贷款契约，银行同志说：“我们已把账转好了，你们还是等县联社有锄头时去领吧！”
    这些农民把玉米收到家里后，县联社却在十一月三十日发下了薅锄。农民们意见很多，有的说：“现在玉米已经收完了，我要这干啥！”
