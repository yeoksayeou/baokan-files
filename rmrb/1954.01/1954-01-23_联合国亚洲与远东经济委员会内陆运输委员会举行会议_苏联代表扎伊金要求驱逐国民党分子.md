    Xinhua News Agency, Kandy, January 22nd: TASS, Kandy, January 20th: The third session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East Inland Transport Committee opened in Kandy, Ceylon, on the 20th. Representatives from seventeen countries are participating in this meeting. The meeting will discuss the reports of the Highway Subcommittee and the Railway Subcommittee, as well as the report submitted by the Inland Transport Committee to the tenth session of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East, and other issues.

    Xinhua News Agency, Kandy, January 22nd: TASS, Kandy, January 21st: At the meeting of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East Inland Transport Committee held on the 20th, Soviet representative D. Zaikin spoke against the attendance of representatives of the Kuomintang clique at the meeting, because the Kuomintang clique has no connection with the Chinese people or China. He said that it is very obvious that the convening of the Inland Transport Committee is for discussing many important technical and economic issues related to railway, highway, and waterway transport of the member states of the United Nations Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East Inland Transport Committee. This meeting cannot proceed normally and effectively without the participation of the only legitimate representatives of China, namely, the representatives of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.

    The Soviet delegation suggested that the following draft resolution be submitted to the meeting for review: "The Inland Transport Committee believes that the representatives appointed by the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China should occupy China's legitimate position in the committee." The Soviet representative said: "The Soviet delegation also believes that the committee must be urged to pay attention to the fact that the representatives of South Korea and Bao Da Vietnam participating in the committee are illegal and cannot truly represent Korea and Vietnam."

    The acting chairman, using procedural rules as an excuse, did not submit the Soviet delegation's proposal to a vote. The Inland Transport Committee elected Indian representative V. K. Badhwar as chairman of the meeting and Ceylon representative Munasinghe as vice-chairman.

    联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会内陆运输委员会举行会议
    苏联代表扎伊金要求驱逐国民党分子
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社康提二十日讯：联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会内陆运输委员会第三次会议于二十日在锡兰的康提开幕。这个会议有十七个国家的代表参加。会议将讨论公路小组委员会和铁路小组委员会的报告，并将讨论内陆运输委员会向联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会第十次会议提出的报告以及其他问题。
    【新华社二十二日讯】塔斯社康提二十一日讯：在联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会内陆运输委员会二十日举行的会议上，苏联代表德·扎伊金发言反对国民党集团代表出席会议，因为国民党集团是和中国人民以及中国没有任何关系的。他说，十分明显，内陆运输委员会的召开，是为了讨论和联合国亚洲与远东经济委员会内陆运输委员会各成员国的铁路、公路和水路运输有关的许多重要的技术和经济问题，这个会议如果没有唯一合法的中国代表、即中华人民共和国中央人民政府的代表参加，是不可能正常地和有效地进行工作的。
    苏联代表团建议把下列一项决议草案交会议审查：“内陆运输委员会认为，中华人民共和国中央人民政府委派的代表，应当在委员会中占有中国的合法地位。”苏联代表说：“苏联代表团还认为，必须促请委员会注意，参加委员会的南朝鲜和保大越南的代表是不合法的，他们是不能真正代表朝鲜和越南的。”
    代理主席以议事规则为借口，不把苏联代表团的建议交付表决。内陆运输委员会选出了印度代表弗·克·巴德瓦拉为会议主席，锡兰代表穆纳辛格为副主席。
