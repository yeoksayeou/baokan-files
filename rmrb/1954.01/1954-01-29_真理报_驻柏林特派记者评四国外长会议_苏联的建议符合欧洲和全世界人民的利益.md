　　"Pravda" Berlin Correspondent Comments on Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference
　　Soviet Proposals Align with the Interests of the People of Europe and the World
Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 28th (TASS): "Pravda" correspondents in Berlin, Zhukov and Kraminov, sent a dispatch on January 27th commenting on the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference. The dispatch was titled: "Finding a Way to Eliminate International Tension is Possible and Necessary!"

The "Pravda" correspondents pointed out: Molotov's speech at the first meeting of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference aroused great interest in European, especially German, public opinion. His speech made people more convinced that if all participants in the meeting were sincere, the Berlin Conference could and should help promote international cooperation. This is precisely the result that the broad masses of European, especially German, society demand.

The "Pravda" correspondents said: Many political observers admit that the Soviet Foreign Minister's proposals are in line with the interests of the people of Europe and the world. Precisely because the Soviet proposals have this characteristic, certain international figures who oppose easing international tensions have had to rush to take measures to prevent the broad masses of society in Europe, America, Asia, and especially Germany, from knowing the essence of the Soviet proposals and drawing their own conclusions. It is now known that these measures were conceived in advance by some American experts headed by Jackson (who has now arrived in Berlin), Eisenhower's right-hand man on "psychological warfare." The "New York Times" spoke about Jackson's task on the opening day of the conference, saying that he would try his best to squeeze out the last drop of propaganda there.

The "Pravda" correspondents pointed out: This work of squeezing out propaganda material began immediately after the first meeting of the foreign ministers. This was obviously to facilitate some people to distort the essence of the Soviet proposals and to take despicable measures to undermine international cooperation. Today, this has already affected the attitude of the West Berlin newspapers. None of the newspapers there published the full text of Molotov's speech, and those newspapers not only distorted his speech, but also distorted his specific proposals.

The representatives of Western countries, on the one hand, criticized the Soviet proposals, and on the other hand, did not put forward any proposals for the Berlin Conference to study. They completely avoided talking about the issue of guaranteeing European security. Dulles' speech at the second meeting of the Four-Power Foreign Ministers Conference on January 26 completely ignored the need to ease international tensions. At the same time, Dulles did his best to distort the essence of the Soviet proposal aimed at establishing a unified, peaceful, and democratic Germany.

The "Pravda" correspondents pointed out: However, it is worth noting that in the current international atmosphere, Dulles did not dare to rashly reject the draft agenda proposed by the Soviet Union. Rejecting this proposal would be tantamount to telling the world that he was unwilling to try to resolve pressing international problems.

Even many Western European bourgeois newspaper commentators currently in Berlin emphasize that the Soviet Union has not only explained the necessity of easing international tensions, but also pointed out the specific ways to achieve this goal. These people expressed attention and sympathy for Molotov's speech on January 26 and the proposal to convene a five-power conference in May or June this year.

The "Pravda" correspondents concluded: Berlin democrats believe that the acceptance of the agenda proposed by the Soviet Union is the result of the peace-loving forces' victorious struggle to ease international tensions. At the same time, people also believe that opponents of international cooperation will continue to hinder the smooth progress of the conference.

　　“真理报”驻柏林特派记者评四国外长会议
　　苏联的建议符合欧洲和全世界人民的利益
    【新华社二十八日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：“真理报”驻柏林特派记者茹科夫和克拉米诺夫在二十七日发了一篇电讯评论四国外长会议，电讯题目是：“找出一条消除国际紧张局势的道路是可能而且应该的！”
    “真理报”记者指出：莫洛托夫在四国外长会议第一次会议上的发言，在欧洲尤其是在德国舆论界中引起了极大兴趣。他的发言使得人们更加相信：如果所有参加会议的人都有诚意，柏林会议就能够而且应该有助于促进国际合作。欧洲尤其是德国广大的社会人士所要求的，正是这样的结果。
    “真理报”记者说：许多政治观察家承认，苏联外交部部长的建议，符合于欧洲以及全世界人民的利益。正是由于苏联的建议具有这样的性质，某些反对缓和国际紧张局势的国际人物才不得不匆匆采取措施，不让欧洲、美洲、亚洲、尤其是德国的广大社会人士知道苏联建议的本质并且得出他们自己的结论。现在，大家已经知道，这些措施是以艾森豪威尔在“心理战”问题上的得力助手杰克逊（现已来到柏林）为首的一些美国专家们事先想好的。“纽约时报”在会议开幕的那一天谈到了杰克逊的任务说：他要在那里尽力榨取最后一滴可以用于宣传的东西。
    “真理报”记者指出：这种榨取宣传材料的工作，在外长们的第一次会议结束后马上就开始了。这显然是为了便利一些人来歪曲苏联建议的本质，来采取破坏国际合作的卑鄙手段。今天，这已经影响了西柏林报纸的态度。那里没有一家报纸发表了莫洛托夫的发言全文，那些报纸不仅歪曲他的发言，而且歪曲他的具体建议。
    西方国家的代表一方面批评苏联的建议，同时又没有提出什么建议来供柏林会议研究。他们完全避免谈到保证欧洲安全的问题。杜勒斯在一月二十六日四国外长会议第二次会议上的发言，完全忽视了必须缓和国际紧张局势的问题。同时，杜勒斯又尽力歪曲目的在于建立一个统一、和平和民主的德国的苏联建议的本质。
    “真理报”记者指出：但是，值得注意的是：在目前的国际气氛下，杜勒斯不敢贸然拒绝苏联提出的会议议程草案。如果拒绝这个建议，就等于告诉全世界，他不愿设法解决迫切的国际问题。
    甚至目前在柏林的许多西欧资产阶级报纸的评论员，也强调苏联不仅说明了缓和国际紧张局势的必要性，而且指出了达到这个目标的具体道路。这些人对莫洛托夫一月二十六日的发言以及要求在今年五、六月间召开五大国会议的建议，表示注意和同情。
    “真理报”记者最后说：柏林民主人士认为，苏联所建议的会议议程被接受，这是爱好和平的力量为缓和国际紧张局势所作的胜利斗争的结果。同时，人们也认为国际合作的反对者还会继续阻挠会议的顺利进行。
