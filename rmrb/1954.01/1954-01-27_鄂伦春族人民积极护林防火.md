　　The Oroqen People Actively Protect Forests and Prevent Fires

　　The Oroqen are a minority ethnic group living in the Greater Khingan Range forest area who traditionally lived by hunting. In the past, they had habits of burning mountains for hunting, as well as smoking and cooking anywhere, which constantly caused forest fires. After liberation, the People's Government gradually educated them about forest protection and fire prevention, and organized representatives of the ethnic group to visit major cities in Northeast China. After realizing the importance of protecting forests for supporting national construction and improving their own lives, they established a forest protection and fire prevention committee, universally formulated patriotic forest protection and fire prevention covenants, and actively carried out forest protection and fire prevention work. Whenever the snow melts in spring and the grass withers in autumn—at the beginning of the two fire prevention seasons of spring and autumn—they organize patrol teams, taking tents to the forest protection stations, patrolling the mountains and inspecting the forests day and night. Last spring, the Ganhe, Nuominhe, and Tuo'ermin fire prevention brigades, composed of Oroqen people, also launched a red flag competition for forest protection and fire prevention with each other. Through the "Patriotic Forest Protection" movement, the Oroqen people have changed their old habit of burning mountains for hunting. Men and women, old and young, consciously refrain from smoking and playing with fire when going out. When hunting, they set up fires by the river hills and riverbanks to cook, and put out the fire completely before leaving. Because the entire Oroqen people actively carry out forest protection and fire prevention, no fires have occurred in the millions of hectares of forest area where they live in the two years of 1952 and 1953.

　　鄂伦春族人民积极护林防火
    鄂伦春族是居住在大兴安岭林区以游猎为生的少数民族，过去他们有烧山打猎和随地吸烟、烧饭的习惯，因而不断引起森林火灾。解放后，人民政府逐步地向他们进行了关于护林防火的教育工作，并组织该族代表到东北各大城市参观。他们认识到保护森林对支持国家建设和改善自己生活的重要关系后，建立了护林防火委员会，普遍订立护林防火爱国公约，积极进行护林防火工作。每当春雪融化和秋草枯黄——春秋两个防火季节开始的时候，他们便组织巡逻队，带着帐篷到护林站去，日夜不息地巡山查林。去年春季，由鄂伦春族人民组成的甘河、诺敏河、托轧敏等防火大队，彼此间还展开了护林防火红旗竞赛。通过“爱国护林”运动，鄂伦春族人民已经改变了烧山打猎的旧习惯，男女老少出外时也都自觉地不抽烟不玩火，打猎时在河丘、河边架火煮饭，饭后把火灭尽才离开。由于鄂伦春全族人民都积极地进行护林防火，所以在他们聚居的数百万垧面积的森林内，一九五二年和一九五三年两年中，从未发生过一次火灾。
