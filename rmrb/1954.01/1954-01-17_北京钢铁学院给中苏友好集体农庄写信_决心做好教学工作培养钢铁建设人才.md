Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Writes to the Sino-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm
Resolves to Improve Teaching and Cultivate Talent for Iron and Steel Construction

Comrades, All Members of the Sino-Soviet Friendship Collective Farm:

    We saw in the People's Daily that you have sold more than one million catties of surplus grain to the state. This patriotic action of actively supporting national industrial construction has deeply inspired us. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, you have learned from the example of Soviet farmers, changed the production relations and production methods of individual farmers for thousands of years, organized socialist collective farms, and realized the principle of collective labor and distribution according to work. Your farm achieved a bumper harvest last year, with production exceeding the previous year by 13.35 percent, and exceeding individual farmers by 43.4 percent. According to the principle of distribution according to work, the members received more income than in the past. This proves the unparalleled superiority of socialist agriculture, and proves that farmers can only live a prosperous and happy life if they follow the socialist road under the leadership of the Communist Party and Chairman Mao.

    Our Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Industry is responsible for training talents for the national iron and steel industry construction. We know that the mass production of iron and steel is the material basis of national industrialization and a necessary condition for agricultural mechanization. Only when the iron and steel industry, the machine manufacturing industry and other industries are developed, can the state manufacture a large number of tractors and other agricultural machines to supply farmers. The development of agricultural economy can promote the further prosperity of industry. Therefore, doing a good job in our teaching work and training a large number of excellent steel engineers is not only the requirement of the state for us, but also the hope of the farmers for us. We guarantee to learn the advanced science and technology and teaching methods of the Soviet Union with an open mind, continue to carry out teaching reforms, actively study politics, and ensure that teachers teach well and students learn well, in order to complete the tasks assigned to us by the state and meet your expectations of us. Let us move forward together under the brilliant light of the general line of the state during the transition period!
          The entire faculty, staff and students of Beijing Institute of Iron and Steel Industry

    北京钢铁学院给中苏友好集体农庄写信
    决心做好教学工作培养钢铁建设人才中苏友好集体农庄全体庄员同志们：
    在人民日报上看到了你们已经将一百多万斤余粮卖给国家的消息，这种积极支援国家工业建设的爱国行动深深地鼓舞了我们。你们在党和毛主席的领导下，学习苏联农民的榜样，改变了几千年来个体农民的生产关系和生产方法，组织了社会主义性质的集体农庄，实现了集体劳动、按劳取酬的原则。你们农庄去年获得了丰收，生产量超过了前年百分之十三点三五，比个体农民超过了百分之四三点四；庄员们根据按劳取酬的原则，得到了比过去更多的收入。这证明了社会主义农业的无比优越性，证明了农民只有在共产党和毛主席的领导下走社会主义的道路，才能过大家富裕的幸福生活。
    我们北京钢铁工业学院担负着为国家培养钢铁工业建设人才的任务。我们知道：大量生产钢铁是国家工业化的物质基础，也是农业机械化的必要条件；只有钢铁工业机器制造业及其它工业发展了，国家才能制造大量的拖拉机和其它农业机器来供给农民使用；而农业经济的发展，又可以促进工业的进一步兴盛。因此，做好我们的教学工作，培养大批优秀的钢铁工程师，不但是国家对我们的要求，也是农民对我们的希望。我们保证虚心学习苏联的先进科学技术和教学方法，继续进行教学改革，积极学习政治，保证先生教好、学生学好，来完成国家给我们的任务，满足你们对我们的希望。让我们共同在国家过渡时期总路线的光辉照耀下前进吧！
          北京钢铁工业学院全体师生员工
