Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, 26th Dispatch from TASS: The German News Agency reported that the Central Executive Committee of the German Communist Party issued an appeal to the German people.

The appeal to the people stated: "These days, all honest Germans and all peace-loving people in the world are watching Berlin with us, hoping to ease international tensions through negotiations, to ease the dangerous situation of an outbreak of conflict, and hoping that the situation will generally ease. Therefore, a peaceful resolution of the German question is of great significance for the security of Europe and even for world peace. We, the German people, wholeheartedly hope to restore the unity of Germany and the independence of a democratic Germany. The Four-Power Conference has created practical possibilities for achieving this hope, as long as the German people adhere to their basic demands: unity, peace, and independence!"

The appeal to the people pointed out that the Soviet people have consistently and resolutely fought for the just national demands of the German people at the conference table. The appeal to the people emphasized the necessity of representatives from East and West Germany participating in the conference. The appeal to the people said: "All party differences, differences in world view and religious belief, all propaganda and deceptive tricks, should not prevent our people from uniting and insisting on demands related to their own vital interests. In order to open the road to peace, unity, and freedom, the policy of re-militarization should be stopped, and the Bonn and Paris treaties should be rejected, because the 'European Defense Community' treaty cannot unify our motherland, nor can it give Germany the right to national self-determination."

The appeal to the people called on the German people to unite, demand peace, demand the easing of international tensions, strive for the attendance of East and West German representatives at the Four-Power Conference, strive for an agreement between Germans, strive for the establishment of an all-German interim government to prepare for and hold truly free and truly democratic all-German elections, strive for the conclusion of a peace treaty with Germany, strive for the peaceful reunification of the motherland, and strive for European security.

　　德共中央执行委员会发表告德国人民书
　　号召德国人民团结争取和平解决德国问题
    【新华社二十七日讯】　据塔斯社柏林二十六日讯：德意志通讯社报道，德国共产党中央执行委员会发表告德国人民书。
    告人民书中写道：“这几天，所有正直的德国人和全世界一切爱好和平的人都与我们一起注视着柏林，希望通过谈判缓和国际紧张局势，缓和有爆发冲突的危险的局面，希望局势会有普遍的缓和。因此，和平解决德国问题对于欧洲的安全以至于对全世界的和平，就具有极大的意义。我们德国人民一心希望恢复德国的统一和恢复一个民主的德国的独立。四大国会议为达到这种希望创造了实际的可能性，只要德国人民坚持自己的基本要求：统一、和平与独立！”
    告人民书指出，苏联人民在会议桌上一贯为德国人民的正义的民族要求而坚决斗争。告人民书强调必须要有东德与西德的代表参加会议。告人民书说：“一切的党派分歧、世界观和宗教信仰的不同、一切宣传与虚伪的把戏，都不应妨碍我国人民团结一致地坚持有关自己切身利益的要求。为了打开通向和平、统一、自由的道路，应该停止执行重新军国主义化的政策，拒绝波恩和巴黎条约，因为‘欧洲防务集团’条约不能使我们祖国统一，不能使德国得到民族自决权。”
    告人民书号召德国人民团结起来，要求和平，要求缓和国际紧张局势，争取东德与西德代表出席四大国会议，争取德国人之间取得协议，争取成立一个全德临时政府以准备并举行真正自由和真正民主的全德选举，争取缔结对德和约和争取祖国的和平统一，争取欧洲安全。
