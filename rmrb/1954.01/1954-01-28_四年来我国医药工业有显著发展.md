China's pharmaceutical industry is growing stronger. Before liberation, most of China's needed medicines were imported from abroad. Since the founding of the People's Republic of China, under the leadership of the Central Ministry of Health and the Ministry of Light Industry, the face of the pharmaceutical industry is undergoing significant changes. State-owned enterprises now produce hundreds of types of medicines and medical equipment, including approximately seventy kinds of raw material drugs. Moreover, new products are increasing daily; in 1953 alone, more than thirty new types were added. Many important medicines that could not be produced in the past, such as penicillin and Sulfaguanidine (intestinal anti-inflammatory drug), can now be produced. Complex physiotherapy equipment, such as X-ray machines, can be manufactured domestically, except for a few major components that need to be imported from fraternal countries. Furthermore, the quality meets the standards, and production is gradually being expanded to meet the needs of the people as soon as possible. China's first electrocardiograph (cardiograph), a precision medical instrument used to record heart activity for diagnosing heart disease, has been successfully trial-produced at the state-owned Shanghai Precision Medical Equipment Factory. Medical research institutions in various regions are also researching many new medicines and equipment suitable for prevention and treatment. In 1954, state-owned factories will add thirteen major new products.

The output of various medicines and medical equipment has also increased year by year. Penicillin production in 1953 increased approximately tenfold compared to 1952, and in 1954 it will increase twofold compared to 1953. The output of Sulfathiazole (S.T.) in 1953 increased approximately twofold compared to 1952, and in 1954 it will increase one and a half times compared to 1953. Moreover, ephedrine, licorice extract, antimony preparations, surgical instruments, and ultra-shortwave diathermy machines, etc., can not only meet domestic needs but also be partially exported. In 1953, the total output value of state-owned and local state-owned pharmaceutical industries increased by 83% and 100% respectively compared to 1952. This year, the total output value of the state-owned pharmaceutical industry will increase to more than 300%; the local state-owned pharmaceutical industry will increase by more than 350% (both calculated with 1952 as 100).

In the past four years, the state has invested a considerable amount of capital in the pharmaceutical industry for capital construction. Some large-scale new factories and workshops capable of producing major products such as penicillin, streptomycin, sulfonamides, chloramphenicol, phenacetin, X-ray machines, ultraviolet lamps, and electrotherapy machines are beginning construction. Some of these are among the 141 enterprises being newly built and renovated with the assistance of the Soviet Union, and will be fully equipped with the latest Soviet technology.

　　四年来我国医药工业有显著发展
    我国医药工业正日益发展壮大。解放以前，我国所需医药品大部从国外输入。中华人民共和国成立以后，在中央卫生部和轻工业部的领导下，医药工业的面貌正在显著改变中。国营企业所产药品和医疗器械已达数百种，其中原料药品已能生产约七十种。而且新产品日益增多，仅一九五三年即增加三十余种。许多过去不能生产的重要药品如青霉素（盘尼西林）、磺胺胍（肠内消炎药）等都已能生产；复杂的理疗器械如“爱克斯”光机除少数主要配件需由兄弟国家进口外，已能自己制造，而且质量都能符合标准，现正逐步扩大产量，以求能早日满足人民需要。用来记录心脏活动以诊断心脏病的精密的医疗器械——我国第一架心电图机（即心动描写器）已在国营上海精密医疗器械厂试制成功。各地的医药研究机关还在研究很多适合于预防和医疗的新药品和器械，一九五四年国营系统各厂还要增加十三种主要新产品。
    各种药品和医疗器材的产量，也逐年增长。青霉素的产量一九五三年较一九五二年提高约十倍，一九五四年将较一九五三年再提高二倍；磺胺噻唑（S．T．）的产量，一九五三年比一九五二年提高了约一倍，一九五四年将较一九五三年再提高一倍半。又如麻黄素、甘草膏、锑制剂、外科手术器械以及超短波电疗机等，不仅已可满足国内需要，而且还可以部分出口。一九五三年，国营和地方国营医药工业的生产总值，比一九五二年分别提高了百分之八十三和百分之百。今年，国营医药工业生产总值将增加到百分之三百以上；地方国营医药工业将增加百分之三百五十以上（以上均以一九五二年为一百算）。
    四年来，国家在医药工业方面投下了相当数量的资金，进行基本建设。一些规模较大的、能生产青霉素、链霉素、磺胺类、氯霉素、非那昔丁、“爱克斯”光机、紫外线灯、电疗机等主要产品的新工厂、新车间正开始建设中，其中有的是属于苏联帮助我国新建和改建的一四一项企业之内的，将要完全按照苏联最新技术装备起来。
