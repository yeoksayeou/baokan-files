    Days of Studying in the Soviet Union
    I Will Always Remember the Friendship of Soviet Comrades
                      Zhao Gansong
    I was originally a technician who had only worked for two years after graduating from university.
    In the autumn of 1951, the Party and the government sent me and several other comrades to study in a chemical combine factory in Ukraine, Soviet Union. Previously, this was a sparsely populated area, but after more than ten years of construction after the October Revolution, it had become a bustling city in the Donbass region. During the Soviet Patriotic War, the factory suffered severe damage and became ruins. After the selfless labor of the workers, the factory was restored and expanded, becoming a large-scale chemical factory. Flowerbeds were built at the entrance of each workshop, and asphalt roads and squares were built in the factory. The face of the city has also changed. Large hospitals, sanatoriums, and many schools have been established in the forest area; there are also department stores, hosiery factories, bread factories, milk and ice cream factories. In summer, every family plants flowers, and flowerbeds are everywhere in public places; at night, the entire city is immersed in the fragrance of tuberose flowers, like a suburban park in Moscow.
    When we arrived at the factory, the factory director and chief engineer warmly received us, first introducing the factory's situation to us. Then the chief engineer took out samples of the factory's produced printed silk fabrics for us to see, saying, "We want to dress our Soviet women into the most beautiful women in the world, this is a glorious task." From the next day, we visited the workshops to get a preliminary understanding of the factory's production situation. After nearly a month, we went to the workshop. Soviet comrades warmly took care of us, asking us to order dishes, saying, "As long as you tell us how to make them, we can cook the most palatable dishes for you." On Sundays, many people invited us to their homes, making us feel like we were in our motherland, in our own home. The children were also so enthusiastic. Every morning when going to work, many children, upon seeing us, would make such innocent and lovely sounds: "Good morning! How are you!"
    In the process of learning, the first hurdle was speaking Russian. In order to quickly master Russian, we used our time day and night to study. The factory arranged Russian teachers for us, and the workshop director wrote new words related to technology for us every day and tested us the next day. While interning, we learned Russian. After three or four months of effort, we could barely talk to people.
    Our internship focused on practical operation, spending 60% to 70% of our time learning from operators, and the remaining time learning the work of foremen, shift supervisors, workshop directors, and deputy directors. The factory provided favorable conditions for learning and research. We could go to the central laboratory to read relevant materials, and the administrator would always tell us about newly received materials, asking us if we needed them. In addition, we were invited to participate in amateur special lectures for engineers and foreman training classes. Once, we were late and didn't hear it, so the factory leadership specially asked the teacher to come to the office to give us a supplementary lecture. They also found experts to open special discussion classes for us, lecturing on chemical engineering principles, dye science, or a specific topic in dye science. Of course, they were very busy, but they were very willing to spend a lot of time preparing teaching materials for us.
    When I started learning as an operator, the instructor handed me over to an advanced technician and said to him, "Tell him everything you know, teach him everything." This technician was very enthusiastic. He explained the principles of operation, equipment layout issues, and put forward suggestions for future improvements.
    After learning from the operators, we learned the work of foremen, shift supervisors, workshop directors, and deputy directors. The workshop director often asked, "Have you learned this? Do you understand that?" The comrades responsible for guiding our learning also often asked us what other assistance we needed from him.
    Soviet comrades not only helped me learn a lot of advanced technical knowledge, but also inspired me to put forward rationalization proposals, which earned me bonuses from the factory. Soviet comrades told me: For the benefit of the country and the people, every creation must be supported and encouraged.
    I have returned to my motherland, and I will always remember the friendship of Soviet comrades. In the future, I will continue to learn from the Soviet Union and apply the advanced experience and science and technology of Soviet socialist construction to China's reality!

  A Vivid Lesson Wu Jiaxiang
    I am a young technician. In the autumn of 1951, I and several other comrades were sent to the Yaroslavl Chemical Factory in the Soviet Union to study. During the two years of studying in the Soviet Union, I learned a lot and realized the advancement of Soviet science and technology.
    When I first arrived in the Soviet Union, I did not pay enough attention to technical safety issues, thinking that it was not closely related to technical personnel. After studying, I realized that this idea was wrong.
    The factory hired a female engineer to talk to us about technical safety issues. She had been working here for twenty years, and the government had awarded her the Labor Red Banner Medal. She felt infinitely honored for this.
    As soon as I arrived in the workshop, the workshop director asked me about technical safety issues. At that time, I felt a little awkward. Although I did not answer well, the workshop director still let me go to the workshop. Every time workers were examined during acceptance, the workshop director asked me to set the questions for the workers. I often felt uneasy because there were many questions I did not know.
    When I was learning the operation of the stoker, an old technician often asked me to do it myself, and he was watching from the side. He said that this would make the learning more solid and could be remembered firmly.
    As the number of exams increased, I felt natural. I also learned a lot of knowledge from the exams. Once, the workshop director asked me: Where should the safety belt of the worker cleaning in the alcohol tank car be fastened on his body? I saw workers cleaning every day, and I thought it was very simple, but now I was stumped all of a sudden. After this exam, I learned that the safety belt should be fastened on the shoulders.
    Before going abroad, although I knew that the producer gas workshop should analyze oxygen, and that if the oxygen content was too high, it might explode, my understanding of this issue was insufficient. At first, I did several analyses every day, but later I became careless. After arriving in the Soviet Union, my understanding of this issue became clearer. The Soviet workshop had sufficient basis to determine the oxygen limit, analyzing it once every hour. If it exceeded the regulations, it must be stopped for inspection. The workshop director checked the analysis every day. When the oxygen approached the limit, the worker performing the analysis notified the squad leader. Once, a newly designed furnace was being tested. On the morning of the test, the workshop director personally put on fireproof glasses to ignite it. After igniting it, everyone went to the operating platform upstairs. Because I did not see clearly when igniting, I came down from upstairs and wanted to open the cover and look inside with my naked eyes. Just then the squad leader came and shouted, "What are you doing? What if the fire hole explodes? Quickly put on your glasses!" At eleven o'clock, a long-distance call came from Moscow, notifying the factory director to tell the workshop director, the leader of the experimental group, and the engineer responsible for technical safety to add a latch to the iron cover of the fire hole. This incident made me realize that the leaders in Moscow were always concerned about the safety of workers far away from Moscow. The design of the furnace was very thoughtful. The operating platform was equipped with an automatic alarm. If the fire in the furnace went out (indicating a danger of explosion), the signal light would immediately issue a warning, and the three valves for fuel gas, air, and raw materials would immediately close automatically, leaving a steam valve. On the day of the test, there were on-duty workers next to the furnace, analyzing it every ten minutes at first, and later changing to every hour. The director of the workshop laboratory also personally took samples for analysis from time to time to check whether the analysis was correct.
    Soviet comrades educated me that every technician must always care about workers and ensure their safety. In the future, I must persistently learn from the Soviet Union. (Attached picture)

    在苏联学习的日子里
    我永远记着苏联同志的友情
                      赵淦松
    我原是一个大学毕业后仅仅做了二年工作的技术人员。
    一九五一年秋，党和政府派我和其他几个同志到苏联乌克兰的一个化学联合工厂里学习。以前这里是一块人烟稀少的地方，在十月革命后经过十多年的建设，它已成为顿巴斯区域的一个热闹城市了。在苏联卫国战争时期，工厂遭受了严重的破坏，成为废墟，经过工人们的忘我劳动，工厂恢复与扩大了，成为一个规模宏大的化学工厂。每个车间的门口，都修起了花圃，厂内也筑好了柏油大路与广场。城市的面貌也改变了，在森林区设立了大医院、疗养所和许多的学校；还有百货公司、织袜厂、面包厂、牛奶和冰淇淋厂。到夏天，每家都种着花，公共场所也到处都是花圃；夜里，整个城市浸沉在夜来香花的清香里，有如莫斯科的近郊公园。
    到了厂里，厂长和总工程师殷勤地接待我们，先给我们介绍工厂的情况，然后总工程师拿出工厂生产的花绸花布样本给我们看，他说：“我们要把我们苏联妇女都装束成为世界上最漂亮的妇女，这是一个光荣任务。”第二天起，我们参观了车间，初步了解了一下工厂的生产情况。将近一个月以后，我们到车间去了。苏联同志热诚地照顾我们，叫我们预定菜，说：“只要您们告诉我们做法，就能为您们烧出最合口味的菜来。”星期天许多人请我们做客，使我们感到好像就在祖国，就在自己家里一样。孩子们也是那么热情。每天早上上班时，许多孩子一见到我们，就发出那样天真可爱的声音：“早安！您好！”
    学习中，第一个难关是说俄语。为了迅速掌握俄文，我们日夜利用时间学习，工厂方面为我们请了俄文教员，车间主任每天为我们写有关技术方面的生字，第二天考我们。一面实习，一面学俄文，经过三四个月的努力，我们可以勉强和人谈话了。
    我们的实习偏重于实际操作，以百分之六十到七十的时间学操作工，用其余时间学工长、值班主任、车间主任和副主任等工作。工厂方面给安排了学习研究的有利条件，我们可以到中央实验室去阅读有关的资料，管理员时时告诉我们新收到的资料，问我们用不用。此外，还请我们参加工程师一级的业余专题讲座和工长训练班。有一次，我们去得晚了，没有听到，工厂领导方面便特地请教员到办公室来，为我们补讲。他们又找专家，为我们开专题讨论课，为我们讲化工原理、染料学，或讲染料学中的某个专题。固然，他们很忙，但他们都非常乐意为我们花许多时间来准备教材。
    开始学操作工时，指导人把我交给一位先进的技工，对他说：“要把您所知道的，全告诉他，教会他。”这位技工，非常热情。他为我讲解操作法原理、设备布置问题，并提出了今后的改进意见。
    学完操作工，我们便学工长、值班主任、车间主任和副主任等工作。车间主任常常问：“这学会了没有？那懂了没有？”负责指导我们学习的同志，也常常问我们，还需要他进行些什么帮助。
    苏联同志不仅帮助我学到许多先进的技术知识，还启发我提出了合理化建议，得到了工厂方面的奖金。苏联同志告诉我：为着国家人民的利益，必须支持、鼓励每一个创造。
    我已回到了祖国，我永远记着苏联同志的友情。今后我要继续学习苏联，把苏联社会主义建设的先进经验和科学技术运用到中国的实际中去！
  生动的一课　吴嘉祥
    我是一个青年技术人员。一九五一年秋，我和其他几个同志被派往苏联雅罗斯拉夫城化工厂学习。在留学苏联的两年间，我学到了很多东西，认识了苏联科学技术的先进性。
    初到苏联时，我对技术保安问题是不够重视的，认为它与技术人员关系不大，学习之后才知道这个想法是不对的。
    工厂里请了一位女工程师，为我们讲技术保安问题。她在这里已经工作了二十年，政府曾奖给她劳动红旗勋章。对这一点，她感觉到无限光荣。
    一到车间，车间主任就提出技术保安问题考我。当时，我心里感到有些别扭。虽然我回答得很不好，车间主任还是放我下车间里去。每次接收工人举行考试时，车间主任要我出题目考工人，我往往感到坐立不安，因为有许多问题我还不知道呢。
    我在学习司炉工人的操作时，一位年老的技工时常要我亲自动手，他把在一旁。他说，这样才会学得扎实些，而且能牢牢记住。
    考试的次数多了，我也就感觉自然了。从考试中我又学得许多知识。一次，车间主任问我：在酒精槽车内清扫的工人，安全带应系在他身上什么地方？我每天看见工人打扫，觉得这很简单，可是现在一下子给问住了。经过这次考试，我才知道安全带要系在肩部。
    在出国前，我虽然知道发生炉车间要对氧气分析，如果含氧过多，就有可能爆炸。但我对这个问题的认识是不足的，起先每天也做几次分析，但后来就马虎起来。到苏联后，我对这个问题的认识更清楚了。苏联车间有充分的根据，确定含氧的界限，每小时分析一次，如果超过规定，一定停车检查。车间主任每天进行检查分析。当氧气接近界限时，进行分析的工人就通知班长。有一次，一个新设计的炉子进行试车，试车的那天早上，车间主任亲自戴上防火眼镜点火，点完火，大家都到楼上操作台去了。点火时我因为没有看清楚，便从楼上下来，想揭开盖子，用肉眼向里看。恰好班长来了，他喊道：“你怎么搞的，万一看火孔爆开怎么办？赶快戴上眼镜！”到十一点钟莫斯科方面来长途电话，通知厂长转告车间主任、实验组组长和负责技术保安的工程师，要他们在看火孔的铁盖上加上插拴。这件事使我体会到莫斯科的领导同志时刻在关心着远离莫斯科的工人的安全。炉子的设计非常周到，操作台上装有自动警报器，如果炉子里火一熄灭（表示有发生爆炸的危险），信号灯马上发出警告，而燃料瓦斯、空气、原料三个活门立刻自动关住，留下一个蒸汽门。试车那天，炉旁有值班工人，每隔十分钟分析一次，后来改为每一小时分析一次。车间化验室主任为了检查分析是否正确，也不时亲自取样分析。
    苏联同志教育了我，每一个技术人员必须时刻关心工人，保障工人的安全。今后我一定要坚持不懈地向苏联学习。（附图片）
