    Xinhua News Agency: Anhui Province along the Huai River region, in order to reduce the threat of drought and flood disasters in agricultural production and improve agricultural production, will begin implementing three agricultural production reform measures this year. These are: (1) Gradually changing the proportion of summer and autumn crop planting areas; (2) Changing to planting high-yield crops, water-resistant crops, and drought-resistant crops; (3) Changing cultivation methods and the habit of extensive planting with low yields. The implementation of this plan is a creative labor undertaken by farmers in Anhui Province in agricultural production under the great instruction of Chairman Mao, "We must harness the Huai River well." The increasingly developing mutual aid and cooperation organizations in the Huai River region of Anhui Province will also fully utilize their advantages in these three reform measures to accelerate the change in the face of agricultural production on the thousands of miles of plains along the Huai River.
    This year, in the preliminary plan for implementing these three major reforms, the Anhui Provincial People's Government decided to first convert 300,000 mu of dry land in the Huaibei area to paddy fields, and change to planting 200,000 mu of high-yield, disaster-resistant potatoes and trial planting other high-yield crops. In order to realize this preliminary plan, the Provincial People's Government has been holding training classes for planting rice and potatoes since October of last year, and will use these trained personnel as the backbone force to train rural cadres and activists in mutual aid and cooperative organizations in the Huaibei area. At the same time, more than 100 district and township cadres with practical production experience were transferred from the rice-growing areas along the Yangtze River to Huaibei to participate in this huge reform work. At present, the 3 million jin of "Victory Xian" improved seeds that the Provincial People's Government is preparing to lend to farmers in Huaibei have been fully prepared. The 21 million jin of potatoes brought from Shaanxi, Hebei, Shandong and other provinces for use as seeds will be transported successively before sowing.
    The Huai River basin has historically been an area prone to flooding and drought. According to historical records, there have been nearly 2,000 disasters of varying sizes in the past two thousand years, with droughts and floods each accounting for half. The Huai River basin is located in the central temperate zone of China, where the low pressure from the Indian Ocean and the Pacific Ocean intersects with the high pressure from Siberia and the Mongolian Plateau. In winter, spring, and early summer, this area is dominated by high pressure, and there is very little rainfall. From the end of June to September, the low pressure of the Indian Ocean or the subtropical high pressure of the Pacific Ocean extends northward, while the high pressure of Siberia and the Mongolian Plateau remains stationary. The two air masses come into contact here, forming continuous torrential rains, which usually account for more than half of the annual rainfall in three months. In the past, in the face of this situation, the fruits of farmers' hard work were often swallowed up by flood and drought disasters. Now, thanks to the initial changes in the threat of floods due to the harnessing of the Huai River, coupled with "changing planting to avoid disasters" to limit the destructive effects of natural laws, farmers in the Huai River area can further increase production. For example, changing dry land grain to rice cultivation means that the concentration of rainfall not only cannot harm crops, but also becomes the most suitable condition. By gradually expanding the planting area of summer crops and reducing the area of autumn crops, and by changing planting methods and cultivation methods, the threat of drought and flood disasters to crops will also be greatly reduced.

### 安徽省沿淮河地区今年实行农业生产改革

    安徽省沿淮河地区今年实行农业生产改革
   【新华社讯】安徽省沿淮河地区为了减少农业生产中的旱涝灾害的威胁，提高农业生产，今年开始对农业生产实行三项改革工作。这就是：（一）逐步改变夏季和秋季农作物播种面积的比重；（二）改种高产作物、耐水作物和耐旱作物；（三）改变耕作方法和广种薄收的习惯。实施这个计划，是安徽省农民在毛主席“一定要把淮河修好”的伟大指示下，在农业生产上进行的创造性的劳动。安徽省日益发展的沿淮地区的互助合作组织，也将在这三项改革工作中充分发挥它的优越性，加速地改变淮河千里平原上农业生产的面貌。
    今年，安徽省人民政府在实施这三大改革的初步计划中，决定首先在淮北地区将三十万亩旱田改种为水稻，并改种二十万亩产量高、抗灾力强的马铃薯和试种其他高产作物。为了实现这个初步计划，省人民政府从去年十月份即举办了种植水稻和马铃薯的训练班，并将以这些经过训练的工作人员作为骨干力量，在淮北地区训练乡村干部和互助合作组织中的积极分子。同时由沿长江水稻地区抽调了一百多名有实际生产经验的区乡干部，到淮北去参加这项巨大的改革工作。现在，省人民政府准备贷给淮北农民的三百万斤“胜利籼”良种已筹办齐备。从陕西、河北和山东等省调来作种籽的两千一百万斤马铃薯，将在播种以前陆续运到。
    淮河流域在历史上是多涝多旱的地区，据史料记载，两千年来即有大小灾害近两千次，旱灾涝灾各占一半。淮河流域处于我国的温带中部，是印度洋、太平洋的低气压与西伯利亚、蒙古高原的高气压交接的地方。在冬春和夏初，这里被高气压所统治，雨量特少。从六月底到九月的三个多月中，又因印度洋的低气压或太平洋副热带的低气压向北伸展，而西伯利亚及蒙古高原的高气压仍停滞不动，两种气团便在这里接触，形成连续性的暴雨，使三个月的降雨量通常占全年降雨量的一半以上。过去农民在这种情况面前，艰苦劳动的成果常被水旱灾害吞没。现在沿淮地区的农民，由于治淮已初步地改变了洪水的威胁，再加上“改种避灾”以限制自然法则所起的破坏作用，将可进一步提高生产。如将旱粮改种水稻，降雨量的集中不仅不能伤害庄稼，而且变成了最相宜的条件。由于逐步扩大夏熟作物的种植面积和减少秋熟作物的面积，由于改种和改变耕作方法，旱涝灾害对农作物的威胁也将大大减轻。
