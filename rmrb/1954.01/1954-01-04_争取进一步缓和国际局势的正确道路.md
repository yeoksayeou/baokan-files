　　The Correct Path to Strive for Further Relaxation of the International Situation
　　As we enter 1954 with the changing of the year, peace-loving people of all countries are welcoming the future with full confidence, determined to contribute all their energy to the sacred cause of defending peace in order to strive for further relaxation of the tense international situation. In his answers to questions posed by Kingsbury Smith, the European Division Chief of the International News Service of the United States, on New Year's Eve, Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, once again pointed out to the people of all countries the correct path to be followed in defending world peace and striving for further relaxation of international tension. There is no doubt that if the people of all countries want to further relax the tense international situation in 1954, they should and must continue to struggle along this path, and try to seek correct solutions to the important issues involved in Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov’s replies.
　　The Soviet government and the Soviet people have always valued the struggle of the people of all countries for international peace and security, and have actively participated in this struggle to safeguard world peace and prevent the threat of war. In the past year, the Soviet government has taken a series of important measures to establish international cooperation and consolidate world peace, making great contributions to the cause of defending peace and winning infinite prestige and trust among millions of people in all countries of the world. As this new year arrives, it is completely understandable that peace-loving people of all countries look up to the powerful peace fortress of the Soviet Union with hope and confidence, watching its new contributions to the cause of defending world peace in the new year. As expected, the leaders of the Soviet government did not disappoint the earnest expectations of the peace-loving people all over the world, and expressed on New Year's Eve the determination and willingness of the Soviet people to continue to fight for relaxing international tension and establishing normal relations between countries. This shows that the Soviet people will always stand with the peace-loving people of all countries, and will give infinite encouragement to the struggle of the peace-loving people all over the world to defend peace and oppose war.
　　Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov expressed heartfelt friendly wishes to the American people on behalf of the Soviet government and the Soviet people. Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov said in his reply: "I sincerely wish the American people happiness and a peaceful life. I wish the American people success in developing friendly relations with the people of all countries, and complete success in the noble cause of defending peace from conspiracies of sabotage." The Soviet government and the Soviet people are friendly to the people of any country, and firmly advocate enhancing and developing economic relations and cultural exchanges among the people of all countries. Therefore, in the minds of the Soviet people, they have never known what the idea of ​​hostility and hatred towards the people of other countries is. At present, the reason why economic relations cannot be enhanced and cultural exchanges cannot be developed between the American people and the Soviet people does not come from the Soviet side, but from the international aggressive groups that attempt to provoke conflict and hostility among the people of all countries for selfish purposes. They spread seeds of hatred among the people of all countries, attempting to poison the peaceful atmosphere among the people of all countries, in order to maintain international tension. The peace-loving people of the United States also see this clearly, so they are constantly fighting to develop friendly relations with the people of all countries. This effort of the American people has aroused widespread sympathy among the people of other countries in the world.
　　Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov also expressed the hope that relations between the Soviet Union and the United States would improve. He said: "I think there are no objective factors preventing the improvement of relations between the Soviet Union and the United States in the new year, and preventing the strengthening of the traditional friendly relations between our two peoples. I hope the actual situation will be like this." The Soviet government’s foreign policy is based on Lenin and Stalin’s theory that two different systems, capitalism and socialism, can coexist and cooperate peacefully. Therefore, the Soviet people not only express friendly wishes to the people of all countries, but also believe that it is possible to coexist peacefully with any country, including the United States. In March 1952, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin said in response to questions raised by a group of American local newspaper editors: "If there is a desire to cooperate with each other, a desire to fulfill the obligations undertaken, and the principles of equality and non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries are observed, then the peaceful coexistence of capitalism and communism is entirely possible." In December of the same year, Joseph Vissarionovich Stalin emphasized again: "It cannot be considered that a war between the United States of America and the Soviet Union is inevitable, and our two countries can also coexist peacefully in the future." Now, Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov has once again expressed to the United States his willingness to improve relations between the two countries, once again fully proving the Soviet Union’s sincerity in seeking further relaxation of international tension.
　　Today, as the desire of the people of all countries for lasting peace is growing, the governments of all countries, especially the governments of major countries, cannot but listen to this call of the people, and cannot but consider their growing desire for lasting peace. The United States government has also made some peace gestures in the past year. However, there is an irreconcilable contradiction between the policy actually pursued by the United States ruling group and these peace gestures. If the United States government truly wants to promote the relaxation of international tension, then it should abandon its policy of aggression against the people of other countries, abandon its "Cold War policy," and embark on the path of resolving international disputes through mutual consultation among the countries concerned.
　　The Soviet government's attitude towards the peaceful aspirations of the people of all countries is very clear. As Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov pointed out in his reply: "It has done, is doing, and will do everything possible to enable the people of all countries to live in peace, to promote the relaxation of international tension, and to establish normal international relations." All those who sincerely uphold peace and international cooperation support the Soviet Union's peaceful foreign policy, because this policy is completely in line with the vital interests and desires of the people of all countries.
　　When Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov talked about what steps should be taken in 1954 that would be the most important steps conducive to world peace, he pointed out: "Such a step is for all countries to conclude an agreement in which each contracting party undertakes the sacred and unconditional obligation not to use atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction. Such an agreement will make it easier to reach an agreement on the complete prohibition of atomic weapons, and on the establishment of strict international supervision to ensure that atomic energy is not used for war purposes. At the same time, the Soviet government believes that it is also necessary to reach an agreement on a substantial reduction in all other types of armaments and armed forces." Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov also pointed out that the implementation of these measures will reduce the military expenditure of various countries and improve the economic conditions of the people.
　　The issue of prohibiting the use of atomic weapons, hydrogen weapons, and other weapons of mass destruction is the issue that the people of all countries are most concerned about and urgently need the countries concerned to solve correctly. In the past, the Soviet government has constantly put forward various reasonable proposals and made great efforts in striving to solve this problem. However, due to the obstruction of international aggressive groups keen on expanding armaments and preparing for war, these good measures have not been able to be realized. For the sake of international peace, the Soviet government put forward new proposals in its statement issued on December 21, 1953. Now, Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov once again emphasizes the significance of this proposal, which not only fully reflects the wishes of the Soviet people and the people of other countries, but also proves that the Soviet government is making unremitting efforts to eliminate the danger of atomic war. However, to achieve this lofty goal, it is also necessary for the peace-loving people all over the world to make greater efforts to urge the governments of the countries concerned to accept this proposal.
　　It is by no means accidental that the reply of Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov, Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, to the questions raised by Kim Smith immediately aroused widespread reactions from many public leaders and newspapers in various countries. This shows that the important issues involved in Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov’s replies are issues that everyone is urgently concerned about.
　　The Chinese people firmly support the reply of Georgy Maximilianovich Malenkov, leader of the Soviet government, to the questions raised by Kim Smith, and are determined to continue to work hard to strive for the solution of the important issues involved in this reply.

### 争取进一步缓和国际局势的正确道路

    争取进一步缓和国际局势的正确道路
    当此岁序更新进入一九五四年的时候，各国爱好和平人民都正在满怀信心地迎接着未来，决心把自己的全部精力贡献给神圣的保卫和平事业，以争取进一步缓和国际紧张局势。苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫在新年前夕对美国国际新闻社欧洲分社社长金斯伯里·史密斯所提出的问题的答复中，再一次向世界各国人民指出了保卫世界和平，争取进一步缓和国际紧张局势所应遵循的正确道路。毫无疑问，各国人民要在一九五四年内使得紧张的国际局势进一步缓和下来，就应当而且必须遵循着这个道路继续奋斗，并设法使格·马·马林科夫在他的答复中所涉及的各项重要问题求得正确的解决。
    苏联政府和苏联人民一向重视各国人民这种争取国际和平与安全的斗争，并积极地参加了这个维护世界和平与防止战争威胁的斗争。苏联政府在过去一年中，为建立国际合作和巩固世界和平，曾采取了一系列的重要措施，对于保卫和平事业作出了巨大的贡献，在世界各国千百万人民中间赢得了无限的威望和信任。在此新的一年到来的时候，各国爱好和平人民都怀着希望和信心仰望着强大的和平堡垒苏联，注视着它在新的一年中对于保卫世界和平事业所作的新的贡献，是完全可以理解的。苏联政府领袖果然不负全世界爱好和平人民的殷切的期望，在新年前夕表示了苏联人民将继续为争取缓和国际紧张局势，争取各国之间建立正常关系而进行斗争的决心和意愿。这表明了苏联人民是永远和各国和平人民站在一起，并将使全世界爱好和平人民保卫和平反对战争的斗争，得到无限的鼓舞力量。
    格·马·马林科夫代表苏联政府和苏联人民对美国人民表示衷心的友好意愿。格·马·马林科夫在他的答复中说：“我衷心祝美国人民幸福，祝他们得过和平生活。我祝美国人民在发展和各国人民的友好关系方面获得成功，在保卫和平免遭阴谋破坏的崇高事业中获得圆满成就。”苏联政府和苏联人民对任何国家的人民都是表示友好的，并坚决主张增进和发展各国人民间的经济关系与文化交流。因此，在苏联人民的思想中，从来不知道对别国人民敌视和仇视的思想为何物。目前美国人民和苏联人民之间，经济关系无法增进，文化交流不得发展，其原因不是来自苏联方面，而是来自那些为了自私的目的而企图挑起各国人民互相冲突和敌视的国际侵略集团。他们在各国人民间散布仇视的种子，企图毒害各国人民间的和平的空气，以保持国际紧张局势。美国爱好和平人民对这一点也是看得清楚的，因此他们正在为发展与各国人民的友好关系而进行着不断的斗争。美国人民的这种努力，在世界其他各国人民中引起了广泛的同情。
    格·马·马林科夫还表示希望苏联和美国之间的关系得到改善。他说：“我认为，没有客观的因素阻碍苏联和美国之间的关系在新的一年内得到改善，阻碍我们两国人民之间传统的友好关系得到加强。我希望实际情况将是这样。”苏联政府的外交政策，是以列宁和斯大林关于资本主义和社会主义两种不同的制度有可能和平共处和合作的学说为根据的。因此，苏联人民不但对各国人民表示友好的意愿，就是对任何国家，包括美国在内，也是认为可能和平共处的。一九五二年三月，约·维·斯大林在答一批美国地方报纸编辑所提出的问题时说：“如果有着互相合作的愿望，有着履行所承担的义务的意愿，并且平等与不干涉他国内政的原则得到遵守，那末资本主义与共产主义的和平共存就是十分可能的。”同年十二月，约·维·斯大林又强调地指出：“不能认为美利坚合众国和苏联之间的战争是不可避免的，我们两国在今后也能够和平共处。”现在，格·马·马林科夫又向美国表示改善两国间关系的意愿，再一次充分地证明了苏联谋求国际紧张局势进一步缓和的诚意。
    在世界各国人民对持久和平的愿望愈来愈增长的今天，各国政府，首先是各大国的政府，不能不倾听人民的这种呼声，不能不考虑他们对持久和平的日益增长的愿望。美国政府在过去一年中，也曾经作过某些和平姿态。但是，美国统治集团所实际奉行的政策与这些和平姿态之间却存在着不可调和的矛盾。美国政府如果真正愿意促使国际紧张局势缓和，那么它便应当抛弃侵略别国人民的政策，抛弃它的“冷战政策”，并走上有关各国以互相协商的方法来解决国际争端的道路。
    苏联政府对于各国人民和平愿望的态度是很清楚的。正如格·马·马林科夫在他的答复中所指出的：“它过去、现在和将来都竭尽一切力量，以使各国人民和平相处，促使国际紧张局势缓和，并建立正常的国际关系。”一切真诚维护和平与国际合作的人们，都是拥护苏联的这种和平外交政策的，因为这一政策是跟各国人民的切身利益和愿望完全一致的。
    格·马·马林科夫在谈到在一九五四年内应该采取怎样的步骤才是有利于世界和平的最重要的步骤这个问题的时候，他指出：“这样的步骤是，各国缔结一个协定，各缔约国在这一协定中承担神圣和无条件的义务，不使用原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性的武器。这样一个协定，将会使关于完全禁止原子武器、关于为保证禁止把原子能用于战争目的而建立严格的国际监督的问题，易于达成协议。和这同时，苏联政府认为，就大量裁减其他一切类型的军备和武装部队的问题达成协议，也是必要的。”格·马·马林科夫并指出，实现这些措施将会减少各国的军费开支，使人民的经济境况有所改善。
    关于禁止使用原子武器、氢武器和其他大规模毁灭性的武器的问题，是目前各国人民最关心而迫切需要有关各国加以正确解决的问题。过去苏联政府在争取解决这个问题方面，曾经不断地提出过各种合理的建议，作过很大的努力。可是，由于热中于扩军备战的国际侵略集团的阻挠，致使这些良好的措施没有能够得到实现。为了国际和平的利益，苏联政府在一九五三年十二月二十一日发表的声明中提出了新的建议。现在，格·马·马林科夫再次着重地说明了这个建议的意义，这不但完全反映了苏联人民和其他各国人民的愿望，而且证明了苏联政府为了消除原子战争危险的问题进行着不懈的努力。但是，要达到这个崇高的目的，还需要全世界爱好和平人民进行更大的努力，督使与此有关的各国政府接受这一建议。
    苏联部长会议主席格·马·马林科夫对金·史密斯所提问题的答复发表后，立即引起了各国许多公众领袖和报纸的广泛反应，决不是偶然的。这说明格·马·马林科夫在答复中所涉及的各项重大问题，是大家所迫切关心的问题。
    中国人民坚决地支持苏联政府领袖格·马·马林科夫对金·史密斯所提问题的答复，并决心为争取这个答复中所涉及的各项重要问题的解决而继续努力。
