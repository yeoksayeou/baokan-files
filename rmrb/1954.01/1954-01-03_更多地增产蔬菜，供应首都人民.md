    Increase Vegetable Production to Supply the People of the Capital
    Yin Weichen, Chairman of the Yinchen Agricultural Production Cooperative, Huangtugang Township, Beijing

    The great year of 1954 has arrived. In 1953, we victoriously completed our plans for increased grain and vegetable production, supplying the workers and citizens of the capital with a large quantity of vegetables and supporting industrial construction. These past few days, all members of our cooperative have been actively engaged in winter production to meet the new tasks of 1954.

    Looking back on the path we have taken over the past year, it truly fills me with joy. Our agricultural production cooperative has grown from eight households to thirty-three households, and our land and farm tools have also greatly increased. Because of the unified use of land, labor, and capital, and the implementation of the principle of "payment according to labor, more work, more gain," the production enthusiasm of the cooperative members has been greatly encouraged, resulting in a significant increase in production. The output of all seventeen major crops in the cooperative increased by 19.3 percent in 1953 compared to 1952. We planted 34 mu of Chinese cabbage, adopting the method of "single-furrow planting, and phased fertilization." We ensured timely watering and prevention of pests and diseases. The average yield per mu reached 17,000 jin, an increase of 80 percent compared to 1952 (including the vegetable plots of new cooperative members before joining the cooperative), and an increase of 24 percent compared to the original cooperative's yield in 1952 (excluding the vegetable plots of new cooperative members). The entire vegetable crop increased by 32.3 percent compared to 1952. Grain crops increased by 11.7 percent compared to 1952. The income of all 105 members of our cooperative generally increased in 1953, with some increasing by more than double compared to 1952. This is all because we listened to Chairman Mao's words and took the path of collectivization.

    After the National Day of 1953, I went to Korea with the Third Delegation to Comfort the Korean People's Army and our most beloved people, the Chinese People's Volunteers. When the Volunteer comrades heard about the glorious achievements of the motherland in construction, it greatly strengthened their determination to fight to the end for the cause of peace. They unanimously expressed that they would redouble their vigilance, hold their positions, and shatter the conspiracies of U.S. imperialism to defend world peace and protect the economic construction of the motherland. They also expressed that they would save every bullet and every thread to support the construction of the motherland. This spirit of high patriotism and internationalism, everything for the motherland and for the people, educated me. I want to learn from their noble qualities and lead our agricultural production cooperative well, so that it can be consolidated and expanded. To produce more vegetables to supply the people of the capital.

    All our cooperative members know that only by consolidating the worker-peasant alliance and realizing national industrialization can the country produce more agricultural tools, tractors, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers to support our agricultural production. Therefore, everyone is determined to follow the Communist Party and strive to realize socialist industrialization.

    更多地增产蔬菜，供应首都人民
    北京市黄土岗乡殷维臣农业生产合作社主席  殷维臣
    伟大的一九五四年到来了。一九五三年，我们胜利地完成了增产粮食和蔬菜的计划，供应了首都工人和市民大量蔬菜，支援了工业建设。这几天，我社全体社员正在积极进行冬季生产，以迎接一九五四年新的任务。
    回想起一年来我们所走过的道路，真使我打心眼里高兴。我们的农业生产合作社已由八户发展到三十三户，土地和农具也都大大增加。由于土地、劳力、资金的统一使用，贯彻了按劳取酬，多劳多得的原则，大大鼓舞了社员生产积极性，使生产有了显著的提高。全社十七种主要作物，一九五三年的产量比一九五二年提高百分之十九点三。我们种的三十四亩大白菜，在一九五三年采用了“单沟栽种，分期施肥”的方法，作到了适时浇水和防治病虫害，平均每亩产量达到了一万七千斤，比一九五二年提高了百分之八十（包括新社员未入社时的菜地在内），比一九五二年原来社里的产量（不包括新社员的菜地）提高了百分之二十四。整个蔬菜作物比一九五二年增产百分之三十二点三。粮食作物比一九五二年增产百分之十一点七。我社共一百零五人，一九五三年的收入普遍增加，有的比一九五二年增加到一倍以上。这都是因为我们听了毛主席的话，走了合作化的道路得来的。
      一九五三年国庆节后，我随着第三届赴朝慰问团到朝鲜，慰问了我们的英雄朋友——朝鲜人民和朝鲜人民军，以及我们最可爱的人——中国人民志愿军，当志愿军同志听到了祖国在建设中的辉煌成绩时，大大加强了他们为和平事业奋斗到底的决心。他们一致表示，要加倍提高警惕，坚守阵地，粉碎美帝国主义的阴谋诡计，以保卫世界和平，保卫祖国的经济建设。他们并表示要节省一枪一弹，一针一线，支援祖国建设。这种一切为祖国，为人民的高度爱国主义和国际主义的精神教育了我。我要学习他们这种高贵品质，好好领导我们的农业生产合作社，使它巩固和扩大起来。以增产更多的蔬菜供应首都人民。
    我们全体社员都知道，只有巩固工农联盟，实现国家工业化，国家才能生产出更多的农具，拖拉机，农药和化学肥料，支持我们的农业生产。因此，大家都决心跟着共产党走，为实现社会主义工业化而奋斗。
