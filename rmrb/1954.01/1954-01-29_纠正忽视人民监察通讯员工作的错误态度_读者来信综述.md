　　Correcting the Erroneous Attitude of Neglecting the Work of People's Supervision Correspondents
　　——A Summary of Readers' Letters

　　Many readers have reflected to this newspaper the current situation in which some units do not value the work of People's Supervision Correspondents. Xing Lansheng, a People's Supervision Correspondent from the Department of Commerce of Jilin Province, reported: "The People's Supervision Correspondent Group of our department was established after the 'Three-Anti' movement in 1952. At that time, there were four members. In daily work and the struggle against bureaucracy, it played a certain role in exposing shortcomings and improving work. Soon, due to personnel changes, there was only one People's Supervision Correspondent left. The Supervision Office was established last year, but no effective measures have been taken to strengthen the work of the People's Supervision Correspondents.” Readers Jiang Feng and Jiang Hong reported: On January 29th of last year, the Harbin Municipal People's Supervision Committee appointed four People's Supervision Correspondents at the Harbin Ball Bearing Factory of the First Ministry of Machine Building Industry's Industrial Automobile Administration Bureau, and requested the factory to publicly announce this and present the "Appointment Letters" to the People's Supervision Correspondents. But it has been a year now, and the four appointment letters are still piled up and have not been issued.

　　More seriously, some People's Supervision Correspondents have also been obstructed and attacked by leaders of their own units in their work. For example, Guo Youzhi, the director of the Majiadao Cooperative in Jingyang County, Shaanxi, unreasonably prevented the People's Supervision Correspondents from holding meetings to discuss work, saying that "further meetings will be treated as illegal activities." Han Rong, a People's Supervision Correspondent at the Harbin Waterworks, reported that Li Hongzhi, a cadre of the factory, was irresponsible in his work, such as failing to hang indicator lights at the construction site, which resulted in a car falling into the pit and injuring seven or eight people. Du Shaoxian, the director of the factory, not only did not support this just action, but also threatened to "fix" the People's Supervision Correspondent.

　　The "General Rules on the Establishment of People's Supervision Correspondents by People's Supervision Organs at All Levels of the People's Government," promulgated by the State Council of the Central People's Government on July 31, 1953, have specifically explained the role and significance of establishing People's Supervision Correspondents. In recent years, many People's Supervision Correspondents have worked actively and played a certain role in supervising the implementation of national policies and decrees, exposing acts that harm the interests of the state and the people, and ensuring the smooth progress of national economic construction. The attitude of leaders in some units who do not value the work of People's Supervision Correspondents, as reflected by readers, is obviously wrong and should be corrected quickly.

　　纠正忽视人民监察通讯员工作的错误态度
　　——读者来信综述
    不少读者向本报反映了目前某些单位不重视人民监察通讯员工作的情况。吉林省商业厅人民监察通讯员邢兰生反映：“我厅人民监察通讯员小组是在一九五二年‘三反’运动后成立的，当时共有四人，在日常工作和反官僚主义斗争中，对揭发缺点，改进工作起了一定的作用。不久因人员调动，人民监察通讯员只剩下一人。去年监察室成立了，但也没有采取有效办法来加强人民监察通讯员工作。”读者江风、江洪反映：去年一月二十九日，哈尔滨市人民监察委员会曾在第一机械工业部工业汽车管理局哈尔滨滚珠轴承厂任命了四名人民监察通讯员，用公函请厂方当众公布并将“任命通知书”授予人民监察通讯员。但到现在已经一年了，四张任命通知书还被积压着没发下去。
    更严重的是：有些人民监察通讯员在工作中还受到本单位领导干部的阻挠和打击。如陕西泾阳县马家道合作社主任郭有智竟无理阻止人民监察通讯员开会讨论工作，说是“再开会要以非法活动论处”。哈尔滨自来水厂人民监察通讯员韩荣检举该厂干部李鸿志工作不负责任，如在修理工地上未挂标示灯，以致发生汽车掉入坑内，伤了七、八人的事故。该厂厂长杜绍先非但不支持这种正义行动，反而威胁说要“整整”人民监察通讯员。
    中央人民政府政务院在一九五三年七月三十一日公布的“各级人民政府人民监察机关设置人民监察通讯员通则”中对设置人民监察通讯员的作用和意义已作了具体的说明。几年来，不少人民监察通讯员积极工作，对监督国家政策、法令的贯彻执行，揭发损害国家和人民利益的行为，以及保证国家经济建设的顺利进行，都起了一定的作用。读者反映的某些单位领导方面不重视人民监察通讯员工作的态度显然是错误的，应该迅速纠正。
