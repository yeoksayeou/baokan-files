Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 21st: The culprit behind the abduction of 27,000 prisoners of war last June, Li Seung-man's Gendarmerie Commander-in-Chief Yuan Rongde, personally arranged the criminal action of forcibly detaining prisoners of war at Dongchang-ri. This fact was revealed today at Panmunjom to Neutral Nations personnel by Jeong Hee-seop, a Korean People's Army prisoner of war who had risked his life to return. He and 56 other Korean and Chinese prisoners of war had risked their lives to escape the control of special agents during the forced transfer of prisoners of war by the Indian custodial troops yesterday and returned this afternoon at 1:00 PM. Jeong Hee-seop, who escaped from Camp No. 40 in the "hospital" camp area, said that he had heard the "battalion commander" read out the "instructions" issued by Yuan Rongde to the special agents in the camp area. In the "instructions," Yuan assigned to the special agents two plans for forcibly detaining prisoners of war: one was a plan to violently carry away prisoners of war when the Indian custodial troops agreed to transfer them; the other was a plan to use the Li puppet army to forcibly seize prisoners of war when the Indian custodial troops refused to transfer them. Yuan issued three American pistols to each special agent leader in each camp area, ready to shoot and kill prisoners of war who attempted to escape north on the spot when carrying them away. Yuan also stipulated two code signals for the special agents: If the Seoul Radio Station broadcast the song "Arirang" between 9:45 PM and 9:50 PM, it meant that the Indian troops agreed to a "peaceful transfer"; if it broadcast the song "Along the Nakdong River," it meant that preparations should be made for a riot to escape south, and the US-Li troops would be dispatched to meet them at that time. If there was no time to broadcast this code signal, red or yellow signal flares would be used instead on the southern edge of the demilitarized zone. Later, Yuan sent a map of the Li Seung-man puppet army's arrangements for seizing prisoners of war to the special agents in the camp area.

Jeong Hee-seop said that from the 17th to the 20th, the special agent leaders in the "hospital" camp area relayed five secret "instructions" from Li Seung-man's headquarters to the special agent leader in Camp No. 40. According to these "instructions," the special agent leader distributed seventy sharp knives and one hundred bayonets to the special agents, and re-organized the prisoners of war into teams, with a special agent carrying a bayonet or knife to monitor each group of prisoners of war. After the reorganization, the special agents forced the prisoners of war to practice escaping day and night.

Volunteer Army returnee Yu Honggan told Neutral Nations personnel that when the Indian troops transferred prisoners of war last night, special agents tied his arm and the arms of five other prisoners of war together with an iron wire, and then threatened them with knives, driving them out of the camp area. The Indian troops did not intervene when they saw this situation. Later, he secretly broke the iron wire and rushed out. Volunteer Army returnee Zhao Wenli said that when he was being carried out of Camp No. 24 yesterday, he was escorted by three special agents carrying knives more than a foot long, one on each side, and another holding tightly to his belt. When he approached the Indian soldiers, he suddenly turned around and kicked the special agent behind him to the ground and ran out.

Volunteer Army returnees said that Chiang Kai-shek's special agents had originally planned to kill those prisoners of war who had revealed their desire to return to their motherland and were being monitored while escaping. Later, the special agent leaders in each camp area received new "instructions" from Taiwan special agents on January 19th and changed their plan, preparing to throw these prisoners of war into the sea after putting them on ships. Yesterday, when special agents used violence to carry away prisoners of war, many people whose legs had been broken because they hoped to be repatriated were placed on stretchers, covered with blankets, and their mouths were stuffed with cotton. The special agents openly said that there was no need to carry these people to the ships, they would be killed on the way.

    冒死遣返归来的我方被俘人员揭露
    李匪特务头子元容德直接策划劫走战俘
    【新华社开城二十一日电】去年六月间劫走两万七千名战俘的罪魁、李承晚宪兵总司令官元容德亲自布置了强迫扣留东场里战俘的罪恶行动。这件事实是今天遣返归来的朝鲜人民军被俘人员郑希涉在板门店对中立国人员揭露的。他与另外五十六名朝中被俘人员都是在昨天印度看管部队强迫移交战俘时冒死逃出特务控制而在今天下午一时遣返归来的。从“医院”营区第四十号营场逃出来的郑希涉说：他曾听到“大队长”宣读元容德发给营场里特务分子的“指示”。元匪在“指示”中给特务分子规定了两套强迫扣留战俘的计划，一套是印度看管部队同意移交战俘时用暴力架走战俘的计划；另一套是在印度看管部队不肯移交战俘时使用李伪军武装劫夺战俘的计划。元匪发给每个营场的特务头子三支美国手枪，准备在架走战俘时就地射杀企图向北逃跑的战俘。元匪还给特务们规定了两种暗号：在晚上九时四十五分到九时五十分，汉城广播电台如果播送“阿里郎”歌曲就是表示印度部队同意“和平移交”，如果播送“洛东江边”歌曲，就是表示要准备暴动向南逃跑，美李军队在那时就会出动接应。如果来不及广播这种暗号时，就在非军事区南缘以红色或黄色的信号弹代替。后来，元匪又把李承晚伪军劫夺战俘布置的地图送给营场里的特务分子。
    郑希涉说：从十七日到二十日，“医院”、营场里的特务头子给第四十号营场的特务头子转来李承晚总部的秘密“指令”五则。特务头子按照这些“指令”把七十把尖刀和一百支刺枪发给特务分子，并且将战俘重新编队，在每一组战俘中就有一个带着刺枪或刀子的特务进行监视。编队以后，特务们就强迫战俘日夜进行逃跑的演习。
    志愿军归来人员余鸿干对中立国人员说：昨天夜里印度部队移交战俘时，特务分子用一根铁丝把他和另外五个战俘的手臂拴在一起，然后拿着刀子威胁着他们，把他们赶出营场。印度部队看到这种情况也没有进行干涉。后来，他偷偷地弄断了铁丝，冲了出来。志愿军归来人员赵文利说：昨天他被架出第二十四号营场时，有三个带着一尺多长刀子的特务押着他，左右各有一个，另一个紧抓着他的腰带，当他走近印度兵的时候，就猛然回头一脚把身后的特务踢倒，跑了出来。
    志愿军归来人员说：蒋匪特务原来准备把那些透露了要回祖国而被监视起来的战俘在逃跑时杀掉，后来各营场的特务头子在一月十九日接到了台湾特务的新“指示”，就改变了计划，准备把这些战俘押上船以后，再丢到海里去。昨天特务分子用暴力架走战俘时，许多因为希望遣返而被打断腿的人是被放在担架上用毯子蒙起来，并且用棉花塞住嘴，抬着走的。特务们公开说，这些人用不着抬到船上去，在路上就要把他们干掉。
