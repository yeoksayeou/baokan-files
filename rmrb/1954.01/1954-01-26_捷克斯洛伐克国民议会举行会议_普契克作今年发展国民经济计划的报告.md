    Xinhua News Agency, Prague, January 25th: The 81st session of the National Assembly of the Czechoslovak Republic was held in Prague on the 20th. Republic Premier Siroky, heads of government departments, representatives of the Czechoslovak Communist Party Central Committee, and representatives of various people's organizations attended the meeting.
    The meeting heard a report by Jo. Pucik, Chairman of the State Planning Commission, on the plan for developing the national economy in 1954. After discussion, the meeting approved the plan.
    In his report, Pucik first spoke about the great achievements of the Czechoslovak people in implementing the First Five-Year Plan (1949-1953). He pointed out that the main goals of the Czechoslovak Five-Year Plan had been achieved, and the entire structure of the national economy had undergone tremendous changes. The production of the means of production had increased by 150%, and its proportion in the total industrial output had increased from 56% in 1948 to 62% in 1953. The proportion of machine manufacturing in the entire industrial production also increased from 16% in 1948 to 26%. At the end of the Five-Year Plan, the socialist sector accounted for 99.6%, 99.8%, 100%, 99.7%, and 45.4% of the entire industry, construction, transportation, commerce, and agriculture, respectively. Compared with 1937, electricity production in 1953 tripled, steel almost doubled, and coal (including lignite) increased by half. During the Five-Year Plan, the total investment used to develop the national economy reached 97 billion crowns (Czech currency). National income increased by about 67%.
    Pucik emphasized that the current strength of Czechoslovakia's economic power can be seen from the national per capita steel production. In 1953, Czechoslovakia's national steel production reached 4.3 million tons. Calculated on a per capita basis (Note: Czechoslovakia has a population of over 12 million), steel production has exceeded the level of Britain, France, and West Germany. The consumer goods industry has also developed. For example, in 1953, the production of cotton and woolen fabrics, linen and semi-linen fabrics, and sugar increased by 19%, 49%, and 28% respectively compared with 1948. In terms of unit area yield in agriculture, wheat increased by 26.1%, rye increased by 16.8%, and barley and potatoes increased by 25.9% and 13.1% respectively during the Five-Year Plan. During the same period, the number of employees in industry and construction increased by 20% and 22% respectively. Labor productivity in industry and construction increased by 64% and 49% respectively. From 1949 to 1953, the wages of industrial and construction workers increased by 56% and 51% respectively. Due to the increase in production and the increase in residents' income, during the same period, the sales of bread and fats increased by 39.4% and 32.2% respectively, meat and shoes increased by 36.2% and 24% respectively, and soap and furniture increased by 22% and 58% respectively.
    Pucik then said that the current level of our national economy has made it possible for us to develop the production of agricultural products, consumer goods, and food more rapidly. At the same time, we will further develop heavy industry and rapidly eliminate the backward state of the national economy, especially in coal mining and electricity production, to ensure that the entire national economy can develop proportionally. Therefore, the 1954 plan for developing the national economy stipulates that the production of the entire industry will increase by 5.1% compared with 1953, of which hard coal and lignite will increase by 8.5% and 7.9% respectively, electricity will increase by 12.2%, pig iron and steel will increase by 8.3% and 4.5% respectively, and the production of machine manufacturing will increase by 10.6%. Agricultural production in 1954 will increase by 12.1% compared with 1953. Investment in agriculture will increase by 105%, and long-term loans to unified agricultural cooperatives will increase by 64%. The income of agricultural laborers will increase by about 18%. Not only should the output of consumer goods and food be increased, but also their variety should be increased and their quality should be improved. In 1954, national income will increase by 7.7% compared with 1953, of which personal consumption will increase to 62%, and the living standards of all residents will increase by 15%. The number of people working in various sectors of the national economy will increase by 4.1%. Labor productivity in industry will increase by 3.8%. Social and cultural facility fees and social insurance fees will increase by 17%.
    Pucik finally said that the state plan should be the law of all enterprises. Therefore, it is necessary to mobilize and organize the creative forces of our people, and with the help of the Soviet Union and various people's democratic countries, further vigorously carry out socialist production competitions, promote the advanced experience of the Soviet Union and our country, to ensure that the goals of the state plan are achieved.

    捷克斯洛伐克国民议会举行会议
    普契克作今年发展国民经济计划的报告
    【新华社布拉格二十五日电】捷克斯洛伐克共和国国民议会第八十一次会议于二十日在布拉格举行。共和国总理西罗基、政府各部门首长、捷共中央代表和各人民团体的代表曾参加了会议。
    会议听取了国家计划委员会主席约·普契克所作的关于一九五四年发展国民经济计划的报告。会议经过讨论后通过了这一计划。
    普契克在报告中首先谈到捷克斯洛伐克人民执行第一个五年计划（一九四九——一九五三年）的巨大成就。他指出：捷克斯洛伐克五年计划的主要目标已经达到了，全部国民经济结构已起了巨大的变化。生产资料的生产已增加了百分之一百五十，它在整个工业的生产总量中所占的比重，已从一九四八年的百分之五十六增加到一九五三年的百分之六十二。机器制造工业的生产在整个工业生产的比重，也从一九四八年的百分之十六增加到百分之二十六。在五年计划终结时，社会主义部分在整个工业、建筑业、运输业、商业和农业中，已分别达到了百分之九十九点六、九十九点八、一百、九十九点七和四十五点四。和一九三七年相比，一九五三年的电力生产增加为三倍，钢差不多增加到二倍，煤（包括褐煤在内）增加为一倍半。在五年计划期间，用于发展国民经济的投资总额，共达九百七十亿克朗（捷币名）。国民收入增加了百分之六十七左右。
    普契克强调说：目前捷克斯洛伐克的经济力量的强大，可以从全国按人口平均的钢产量上看出来。一九五三年捷克斯洛伐克全国产钢达四百三十万吨，如按人口平均计算（按：捷克斯洛伐克全国有一千二百余万人），钢产量已超过了英国、法国、西德的水平。消费品工业也获得了发展，如一九五三年的棉和毛织品，亚麻和半亚麻织品，以及糖的生产，已比一九四八年分别增加了百分之十九、四十九和二十八。在农业的单位面积产量方面，在五年计划期间，小麦增加了百分之二十六点一，裸麦增加了百分之十六点八，大麦和马铃薯分别增加了百分之二十五点九和十三点一。在同一时期，工业和建筑业中的职工人数分别增加了百分之二十和二十二。工业和建筑业的劳动生产率分别提高了百分之六十四和四十九。从一九四九年到一九五三年，工业和建筑业工人的工资分别增加了百分之五十六和五十一。由于生产的增加和居民收入的增加，在同一时期内，面包和脂肪的销售额分别增加了百分之三十九点四和三十二点二，肉类和鞋类分别增加了百分之三十六点二和二十四，肥皂和家具分别增加了百分之二十二和五十八。
    普契克接着说：我国目前的国民经济水平，已使我们有可能更迅速地发展农产品、消费品和食品的生产。同时，将进一步发展重工业并迅速消除国民经济中，特别是采煤和电力生产方面的落后状态，以保证全部国民经济能够按比例发展。因此，一九五四年发展国民经济计划规定：整个工业的生产将比一九五三年增加百分之五点一，其中硬煤和褐煤将分别增加百分之八点五和七点九，电力将增加百分之十二点二，铣铁和钢将分别增加百分之八点三和四点五，机器制造业的生产将增加百分之十点六。一九五四年农业生产将比一九五三年增加百分之十二点一。对农业的投资将增加百分之一百零五，对统一农业合作社的长期贷款将增加百分之六十四。农业劳动者的收入约将增加百分之十八。不仅要增加消费品和食品的产量，而且还要增加其种类并提高其质量。一九五四年国民收入将比一九五三年增加百分之七点七，其中个人消费部分将增加到百分之六十二，全体居民的生活水平将提高百分之十五。在国民经济各部门中工作的人数，将增加百分之四点一。工业中的劳动生产率将提高百分之三点八。社会文化设施费和社会保险费将增加百分之十七。
    普契克最后说：国家计划应该是一切企业的法律，因此，必须动员和组织我国人民的创造性力量，在苏联和各人民民主国家的帮助下，进一步大力地开展社会主义生产竞赛，推广苏联和我国的先进经验，以保证达到国家计划的目标。
