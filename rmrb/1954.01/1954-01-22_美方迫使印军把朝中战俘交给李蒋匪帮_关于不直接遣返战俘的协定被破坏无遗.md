Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 20th -- A special correspondent of this agency reported: The illegal handover of Korean and Chinese POWs to the U.S. side by the Indian Custodial Forces today once again eloquently proves that the position adhered to by the Korean and Chinese side – opposing the return of POWs to the original detaining party, making up the ninety-day explanation period, and removing U.S. special agents from the POW camps so that the POWs have full opportunity to exercise their right to apply for repatriation – is completely correct.

About eighty POWs escaped from the clutches of the special agents at the last moment before being handed over to the U.S. side; they are living proof of the U.S. side's forced detention of POWs. Today, in order to facilitate the control of POWs and prevent them from daring to request repatriation, U.S. special agents refused to let them march out of the camp one by one in a line, but instead押着 pushed hundreds of POWs to swarm out in groups. However, neither the knives and wooden sticks in the hands of the special agents, nor the intimidation from the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek bandits through loudspeakers, nor the roar of groups of American airplanes could make these POWs abandon their desire to return home. Some of them, with great courage, risked being beaten to death on the spot by the special agents and resolutely rushed out to request repatriation.

This fact fully demonstrates that the POWs want to be repatriated, the only condition is to enable them to get rid of the control of the special agents and give them full opportunity to listen to explanations. The Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission did not give them such an opportunity in the past, and now it has completely deprived them of their legitimate right to listen to explanations. When the POWs were escorted out of the camp and walked towards their tragic future under the surveillance of the U.S. military, their faces were filled with a disoriented expression, which shows how disappointed and painful they were that the Indian Custodial Forces had cut off their opportunity to return home.

Although the Indian Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission claimed that what it handed over to the U.S. side were POWs, and warned that any unilateral handling of POWs would be a violation of the "scope of authority", this warning will obviously have no effect on the U.S. side, which has always been faithless and unrighteous. The so-called Commander-in-Chief of the United Nations Command, Hull, kicked Timayya's warning back like a football yesterday. In a letter to Timayya, he reiterated that "under any circumstances," he would grant the POWs so-called "freedom" on January 23. There is only one meaning to this "freedom," which is to join the Syngman Rhee puppet army or the Kuomintang remnant bandit army. The U.S. side once shamelessly promoted that they would keep the POWs in some kind of reception station and wait until January 23 to "release" these people as so-called civilians, but today, January 20, the Korean People's Army POWs received by the U.S. side have been transported by train to the South Korean military centers of Gunsan and Pohang. In these two replacement training centers, a large group of Rhee puppet army officers are about to interrogate them. As soon as the Chinese People's Volunteer Army POWs left the demilitarized zone, they fell into the hands of military police from Taiwan.

After undermining the explanation work of the Korean and Chinese sides with various shameless means, the U.S. side used strong pressure to force the Indian Custodial Forces to take illegal actions to return the POWs, in order to achieve its goal of forcibly detaining the POWs and sending them to Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek as cannon fodder. So far, the agreement on non-direct repatriation of POWs before the Korean armistice has been completely violated.

### 美方迫使印军把朝中战俘交给李蒋匪帮  关于不直接遣返战俘的协定被破坏无遗

    美方迫使印军把朝中战俘交给李蒋匪帮
    关于不直接遣返战俘的协定被破坏无遗
    【新华社开城二十日电】本社特派记者报道：今天印度看管部队将朝中战俘非法交还给美方的情形，再次雄辩地证明朝中方面所坚持的反对送还战俘给原拘留方、补足九十天的解释时间、清除战俘营中的美方特务、以便战俘有充分机会行使其申请遣返权利的主张是完全正确的。
    有约八十名战俘在被移交给美方的最后关头从特务的魔爪里逃出，他们就是美方强迫扣留战俘的活生生的证据。美方特务今天为了便于控制战俘，使他们不敢要求遣返，拒绝列队逐个地走出营场，而是押着几百名战俘成群地蜂拥而出。但是，无论是特务手中的刀子和木棍，无论是台湾蒋匪通过扩音器发出的恫吓，无论是成群的美国飞机的吼叫，都不能使这些战俘放弃回家的愿望。他们中间有些人就以极大的勇气，冒着被特务当场打死的危险，坚决地冲出来要求遣返。
    这个事实充分说明：战俘是要求遣返的，唯一的条件就是要使他们能够摆脱特务的控制，给予他们听取解释的充分机会。中立国遣返委员会过去没有给予他们这样的机会，现在又完全剥夺了他们听取解释的合法权利。战俘在被押出营场以后，在美军监视之下走向他们悲惨的未来的时候，脸上都带着失神的表情，这说明他们对于印度看管部队断绝了他们回家的机会感到多么的失望和痛苦。
    尽管中立国遣返委员会印度主席声称它所交给美方的是战俘，而且警告说任何片面处理战俘的行为都是违反“职权范围”的。但是这种警告对于一贯背信弃义的美方，显然不会有丝毫作用。所谓联合国军总司令赫尔昨天像踢皮球一样把蒂迈雅的警告又踢了回去。他在给蒂迈雅的一封信中重申，“在任何一种情况下”，他都将在一月二十三日使战俘获得所谓“自由”。这种“自由”只有一个，就是参加李承晚伪军或者国民党残余匪军。美方曾经厚颜无耻地宣传他们要把战俘留在什么收容站，等到一月二十三日才将这些人“释放”为所谓平民，但是，今天，一月二十日，美方所接收的朝鲜人民军战俘已经被用火车分别运往南朝鲜的军事中心群山和浦项。在这两个新兵补充站里，一大批李伪军军官正在要审问他们。中国人民志愿军战俘则一出非军事区就落入了从台湾来的宪兵的手里。
    美方在以种种无耻手段破坏朝中方面的解释工作以后，又以强大的压力迫使印度看管部队采取非法交还战俘的行动，以达到其强迫扣留战俘并送给李承晚、蒋介石当炮灰的目的。至此，朝鲜停战前有关未予直接遣返的战俘协定已被破坏无遗。
