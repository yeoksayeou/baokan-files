Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 31st -- The Korean-Chinese delegation to the Military Armistice Commission issued the following communique on the 31st:

    Due to sabotage by the U.S. side, the explanation work by the Korean-Chinese side lasted only ten days, and more than 85 percent of the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war had not yet received explanations. Therefore, the explanation period must be extended. Fair-minded public opinion throughout the world unanimously sympathizes with the Korean-Chinese side's demand that the ninety-day explanation period must be replenished. The U.S. side is looking for excuses, attempting to legalize its plot to forcibly detain prisoners of war by opposing the replenishment of the explanation period. Sun Won-il, the puppet Minister of National Defense of South Korea, recently repeated the old tune of the U.S. side regarding "screening" prisoners of war, the purpose of which is to use the so-called "screening" of prisoners of war to cover up the U.S. crime of forcibly detaining prisoners of war.

    In view of this, General Li Xiangchao, representative of the Korean-Chinese side, sent a letter to General Thimayya, Chairman of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, on December 31, 1953, pointing out: Only after a sufficient period of explanation can the fears accumulated by the prisoners of war under the long-term rule of spies by the United Nations forces be eliminated, allowing them to exercise their right to be repatriated. If the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces do not take action on the Korean-Chinese side's request to resume explanation work and replenish the explanation time, but instead attempt to conduct "screening" or disguised "screening" of prisoners of war in order to select so-called "willing to return" personnel, it will be a complete tearing up of the "Terms of Reference," and the Korean-Chinese side will never agree to such illegal acts.

    The interim report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission also clearly acknowledges that the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war are currently completely under the control of Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee's spies directed by the U.S. side. How can those willing to return home be selected under these circumstances? Therefore, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission or the Indian Custodial Forces' idea of ​​"screening" prisoners of war not only violates the "Terms of Reference," but also violates the report passed by a majority of countries in the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission.

    Fair-minded public opinion throughout the world knows that the Korean-Chinese prisoners of war have been deprived of their right to repatriation by Chiang Kai-shek and Syngman Rhee's spies directed by the U.S. side, and unanimously sympathizes with our just demand that the explanation period must be replenished. Therefore, the U.S. side is looking for excuses to legalize its claim of opposing the extension of the explanation period and forcibly detaining prisoners of war. If some members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission or the Indian Custodial Forces disregard our firm opposition and conduct "screening" of prisoners of war, wouldn't that be legalizing the United Nations forces' plot to forcibly detain prisoners of war?

    The Korean-Chinese side firmly opposes any "screening" proposals or actions and requests the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces to seriously consider the Korean-Chinese side's views.

### 李相朝将军致函中立国遣返委员会主席  坚决反对任何“甄别”战俘的非法行为

    李相朝将军致函中立国遣返委员会主席
    坚决反对任何“甄别”战俘的非法行为
    【新华社开城三十一日电】军事停战委员会朝中代表团三十一日发表公报如下：
    由于美方的破坏，朝中方面的解释工作只进行了十天，尚有百分之八十五以上的朝中被俘人员仍未听取解释，因此解释期限必须延长。全世界公正的舆论都一致同情朝中方面关于九十天的解释日期必须补足的主张。美方正在寻找借口，企图使其反对补足解释日期强迫扣留战俘的阴谋合法化。南朝鲜的伪国防部长官孙元一最近又重弹美方关于“甄别”战俘的老调，其目的就在于利用所谓“甄别”战俘，以掩饰美方强迫扣留战俘的罪行。
    有鉴于此，朝中代表李相朝将军于一九五三年十二月三十一日致函中立国遣返委员会主席蒂迈雅将军指出：只有经过充足时间的解释，才能消除战俘在联合国军长期的特务统治下所积累的疑惧，使他们有行使其被遣返权利的机会。如果中立国遣返委员会与印度看管部队对于朝中方面恢复解释工作补足解释时间的要求不采取行动，却试图对战俘进行“甄别”或变相的“甄别”，以挑选出所谓愿意回家者，则将是彻底撕毁“职权范围”，朝中方面将决不同意这种非法行为。
    中立国遣返委员会的临时报告，也明白承认了朝中被俘人员目前是完全处于美方指使的蒋李特务的控制之下，请问在这种情况下愿意回家者如何能被挑选出来？因此，中立国遣返委员会或印度看管部队这种“甄别”战俘的设想不仅是违反了“职权范围”，而且也是违反中立国遣返委员会多数国家所通过的报告的。
    全世界的公正舆论都知道朝中被俘人员被美方指使的蒋李特务剥夺了被遣返的权利，一致同情我方解释期限必须补足的正义主张。因此，美方正在找寻借口使其反对延长解释期限、强迫扣留战俘的主张合法化。如果中立国遣返委员会的某些委员或印度看管部队竟然不顾我方坚决反对而对战俘进行“甄别”，那不正是使联合国军强迫扣留战俘的阴谋合法化？
    朝中方面坚决反对任何“甄别”的主张或行动，要求中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队郑重考虑朝中方面的意见。
