Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 5th: The Soviet economist K. Ostrovityanov recently published an article in the "Economic Issues" magazine entitled "On Production and Consumption Under the Socialist System," elucidating the relationship between production and consumption in various historical periods of the Soviet Union.

The author states: The requirements of the basic economic law of socialism are realized under specific historical conditions, along with the level achieved by the productive forces, the available material resources, and the level of the workers' needs and purchasing power. The ratio between the production of the means of production and the production of consumer goods changes accordingly. Therefore, it is necessary to specifically analyze how the role of the basic economic law of socialism is manifested in different historical conditions, in different stages of socialist construction, and what kind of relationship between production and consumption arises from this.

In the transitional period from capitalism to socialism, the law that the relations of production must adapt to the productive forces plays a role. This law requires the establishment of socialist relations of production throughout the national economy, both in industry and in agriculture. The basic contradiction of the transitional period is the struggle between dying capitalism and nascent socialism. The characteristic of the transitional period is the gradual loss of function of various economic laws of capitalism and the gradual formation of various economic laws of socialism. The basic economic law of socialism has already begun to function primarily in socialist components and affects the development of the entire national economy. However, small commodity and capitalist components still exist simultaneously. A "who will win" struggle is being waged between socialism and capitalism.

The situation of the Soviet state (at that time it was the only country with the dictatorship of the proletariat, a technologically and economically backward country, and a country surrounded by hostile capitalism) required the full development of heavy industry. The dominant development of heavy industry was both a necessary condition for the existence of the state of the proletarian dictatorship and a necessary condition for the smooth construction of socialism in this country, and therefore also a necessary condition for continuously improving the material well-being and cultural level of the workers and creating the prerequisites for their ever-growing demands.

Therefore, the requirements of the basic economic law of socialism in this period mainly lie in the full development of heavy industry and its heart, the machine-building industry, and in improving the material conditions of the workers and raising their cultural level to the extent permitted by the accelerated development of heavy industry, which requires a large amount of capital (which can only produce production results after a few years). Thus, the establishment of heavy industry must be paid for at a great cost.

The historically unprecedented speed of development of heavy industry requires that the production of means of production exceed the production of consumer goods by several times. For example, in the first Five-Year Plan, heavy industry investment accounted for 21.3 billion out of 24.8 billion rubles of industrial basic investment. In the second Five-Year Plan, 49.8 billion out of 58.6 billion rubles of industrial basic investment was for heavy industry. In the three and a half years of the third Five-Year Plan, the industrial basic investment was 64 billion rubles, of which heavy industry accounted for 55 billion. As a result, the proportion of heavy industry in the entire industry increased from one-third before the October Revolution to 58 percent in 1937.

The rapid development of heavy industry created the necessary prerequisites for the socialist transformation of the small-peasant economy through collectivization.

The role of the basic economic law of socialism throughout the transitional period is manifested in the continuous improvement of the material and cultural level of workers along with the socialist industrialization and agricultural collectivization of the state. In 1940, the income of workers increased by more than two times compared to 1913, and the income of farmers increased by about two and a half times.

After the victory of socialism, with the elimination of capitalist components, the scope of the basic economic law of socialism expanded to the entire national economy. However, the international situation still did not allow for a rapid shift to expanding the production of consumer goods. Initially, the necessity of the state's preparation for active defense, and later the Great Patriotic War against the fascist aggressors, required the rapid development of heavy industry. During the years of World War II, a strong heavy industry became a solid foundation for arming the Soviet army and one of the decisive conditions for defeating the enemy.

The war delayed the development of Soviet industry by approximately two Five-Year Plans. The post-war period required a considerable amount of time to restore the pre-war level and greatly exceed this level. All these determined the necessity of accelerating the development of heavy industry, especially the machine-building industry. As a result of post-war industrial development, the proportion of means of production in industry increased from 58 percent in 1937 to 70 percent in 1953.

The author then points out: Now the conditions are different, and the level of development achieved by heavy industry now makes it possible to greatly accelerate the development of various departments producing consumer goods. For this purpose, it is necessary to increase the basic investment in the industrial departments that produce consumer goods, so that heavy industry can serve these departments and supply them with the most advanced modern machines. At the same time, heavy industry should greatly increase the production of daily necessities for the people, including various cultural and living supplies that alleviate the labor of the Soviet people and improve their living conditions.

When discussing the transition to a direct product exchange system, the author emphasizes: It is imperative to fully emphasize the immutability of the following Marxist-Leninist principle, that is, we can only reach the disappearance of the law of value, money, commodity circulation, and the establishment of the communist principle of direct exchange at the advanced stage of communism by fully utilizing the law of value and developing commodity circulation in the socialist stage.

    阐述苏联各历史时期中生产和消费的关系
   【新华社莫斯科五日电】苏联经济学家康·奥斯特罗维季扬诺夫在新近出版的“经济问题”杂志上发表了题为“论社会主义制度下的生产和消费”的文章，阐述苏联历史各个时期中生产和消费的关系。
    作者说：社会主义基本经济法则的要求，在具体历史条件下，是随着生产力所达到的水平，随着现有的物质资源，随着劳动者的需要和购买力的水平而实现的。生产资料的生产和消费品的生产之间的比例，也就随着这而改变。因此必须具体分析社会主义基本经济法则的作用如何在各个不同的历史条件下，在社会主义建设的不同阶段中表现出来，以及由此产生什么样的生产和消费的相互关系。
    在从资本主义到社会主义的过渡时期中，起作用的是生产关系必须适应生产力的法则。这个法则要求在整个国民经济中，既在工业中，也在农业中，建立社会主义的生产关系。过渡时期的基本矛盾是垂死的资本主义和新生的社会主义间的斗争。过渡时期的特点是资本主义各经济法则的逐渐失去作用和社会主义各经济法则的逐渐形成。社会主义基本经济法则已首先在社会主义成份中发生作用，并影响整个国民经济的发展。但小商品的和资本主义的成份还同时存在着。社会主义和资本主义间进行着“谁战胜谁”的斗争。
    苏维埃国家的情况（当时它是唯一的无产阶级专政的国家，是技术经济落后、处在敌对的资本主义包围中的国家），要求全力发展重工业。重工业的占优势的发展既是无产阶级专政国家存在本身的必要条件，也是在这个国家中顺利建设社会主义的必要条件，因而也是为不断提高劳动者的物质福利和文化水平，为他们的要求不断增长创造前提的必要条件。
    因此，这个时期社会主义基本经济法则的要求便主要在于全力发展重工业及其心脏机器制造业，并在花费大量资财（这些资财只有到几年以后才能产生生产效果）的重工业加速发展所许可的范围内，改善劳动者的物质状况和提高劳动者的文化水平。这样，建立重工业便必须付出重大的代价。
    以历史上空前的速度发展重工业，要求生产资料的生产超过消费品的生产好几倍。例如，第一个五年计划工业基本投资二百四十八亿卢布中，重工业投资占二百十三亿。第二个五年计划的五百八十六亿卢布工业基本投资中，有四百九十八亿为重工业投资。第三个五年计划的三年半中的工业基本投资为六百四十亿卢布，重工业占了五百五十亿。结果重工业在整个工业中的比重便由十月革命前的三分之一增长到一九三七年的百分之五十八。
    重工业的迅速发展，为经过集体化对小农经济进行社会主义改造创造了必要前提。
    社会主义基本经济法则在整个过渡时期的作用，表现在：伴随着社会主义的国家工业化和农业集体化而来的是劳动者的物质和文化水平的不断提高。一九四零年工人的收入比一九一三年增加了两倍多，农民的收入增加了约两倍半。
    社会主义胜利后，随着资本主义成份的消灭，社会主义基本经济法则的作用范围扩及于整个国民经济。但是，国际情况还不允许实行急速扩大消费品生产的转变。起初是国家准备积极防御的必要性，后来是反法西斯侵略者的伟大卫国战争，要求迅速发展重工业。在第二次世界大战的年代中，强大的重工业成为武装苏军的巩固基础，并成为击溃敌人的决定性条件之一。
    战争把苏联工业的发展拖延了大约两个五年计划。战后时期需要有一个相当的时间来恢复战前水平和大大地超过这个水平。所有这些便决定了加速发展重工业，首先是机器制造业的必要性。战后工业发展的结果，生产资料的产品在工业中的比重从一九三七年的百分之五十八增加到了一九五三年的百分之七十。
    作者接着指出：现在条件不同了，现在重工业所达到的发展水平，已使得有可能大大加速发展生产消费品的各个部门。为此便需要增加生产消费品的工业部门的基本投资，使重工业为这些部门服务，供给它们以最先进的现代机器。同时，重工业还应该为人民大大增加日用品的生产，包括减轻苏联人民劳动和改善其生活条件的各种文化上生活上的用品。
    作者在谈到过渡到直接的产品交换制问题时强调说：必须全力强调马克思列宁主义如下这一原理之不可动摇性，即我们只有在社会主义阶段上全力利用价值法则和开展商品流转，才能在共产主义的高级阶段上达到价值法则、货币、商品流通的消逝和共产主义的直接交换原则的确立。
