    【This Newspaper News】In the first year of China's Five-Year Plan, many basic construction projects completed their annual plans ahead of schedule, and many newly built enterprises were put into production one after another. Regarding heavy industry construction, which plays a decisive role in China's socialist industrialization, the automated large-scale rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, and No. 7 blast furnace of Anshan Iron and Steel Company have officially started production; the six small blast furnaces of the state-owned Ma'anshan Iron Plant, which were successfully renovated, were also put into production before the New Year. The four major projects under construction by the machinery system—the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant, the Measuring and Cutting Tool Plant, the First Machine Tool Plant, and the Pneumatic Tool Plant—have completed their 1953 annual plans; the construction project of China's first large-scale large-scale electrical machinery plant was completed on October 20 last year, and the installation of mechanical equipment will continue this year, with partial production expected in August and September. In the fuel industry system, five pairs of shaft projects were completed last year and will be put into production this year. Large, medium, and small power stations such as Fengman, Xi'an, Zhengzhou, Dihua, GuiSui, Bayanhot, and Huangyuan have successively begun generating electricity. The civil engineering construction of the Chongqing 507 Power Plant project has been basically completed, and the entire plant will be put into production in March this year. The concrete foundations of the 919 iron towers for the 220,000-volt ultra-high-voltage transmission line in the Northeast Region were successfully completed before the freeze. The Taiyuan Thermal Power Plant, which is currently under construction, completed the excavation of more than 20,050 cubic meters of earthwork at the main plant site one day ahead of schedule on November 24 last year. In the textile industry system, ten new and expanded factories were put into production last year. In the light industry system, the Zijin Sugar Factory, Tianjin Winery, Shijiazhuang Winery, and the Central Bureau of Weights and Measures completed all factory construction projects last year; the first-phase expansion projects of the Guangzhou Paper Mill and Zigong Salt Factory were completed, and these factories have been or will be put into production successively. In addition, key projects in the railway system, such as the Lanzhou-Subei section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway and the Chengdu-Lueyang section of the Baoji-Chengdu Railway, have overfulfilled the 1953 plan, and the Shaoyang-Fengcheng Railway and the Tangyuan-Lindu Railway have completed the 1953 annual construction tasks.
    The basic construction plan of the Central People's Government's Ministry of Heavy Industry has been fully completed, and the basic construction plans of other industrial departments have been completed on average by more than 95 percent. The basic construction projects of many provinces and cities have also completed their tasks ahead of schedule. Shenyang, Harbin, and Dalian in the Northeast Region, and Heilongjiang Province have successfully completed their 1953 construction engineering tasks. The construction engineering plan in North China last year was basically completed before the New Year. According to incomplete statistics from Shanxi, Hebei, and Suiyuan Provinces and Beijing and Tianjin, more than five million square meters of construction engineering have been completed. The 39 construction projects contracted by the Third Engineering Department of the East China Construction Engineering Company have all been completed. The bureaus and mines under the State-owned Coal Mine Administration in the Central and Southern Regions have basically completed the basic construction tasks for 1953. The expanded mines in Sichuan Province last year have all been completed, and the new mines are expected to be put into production in February and March this year. In order to adapt to the needs of national economic construction and meet the needs of material exchange between urban and rural areas, Sichuan Province built, renovated, and restored 17 highways last year, with a total length of 1,080 kilometers, most of which were completed before the New Year. The Northwest Petroleum Administration Bureau, Huainan Mining Bureau, Fushun Mining Bureau, Jiaozuo Mining Bureau, Jingxing Mining Bureau, Yunnan Dongchuan Mining Bureau, Jinggangshan Iron Mine, and other drilling companies and drilling teams, as well as the Sichuan Petroleum Exploration Team, all completed geological and drilling tasks ahead of schedule.
    The early completion of these basic construction projects is a major victory in China's implementation of the Five-Year Construction Plan, and also a major contribution of China's working class to the country's realization of socialist industrialization. After the Anshan Iron and Steel Company's large-scale rolling mill, seamless steel tube plant, No. 7 blast furnace, and No. 8 blast furnace, which was put into production in March last year, are officially put into production, Anshan's pig iron production capacity will increase by more than 60 percent, and steel production capacity will increase by about 40 to 60 percent. The significant increase in the output of these products will greatly help the development of the national industry, agriculture, and transportation industries. After the new large-scale electrical machinery plant is put into production, it can produce various large-scale electrical machinery urgently needed for China's construction, including 10,000-kilowatt and 16,000-kilowatt hydro-generators. The electricity transmitted by the Xi'an Second Power Plant and the original electricity in Xi'an City are combined into a unified power grid, which can fully supply electricity for the emerging cotton textile, machinery, and flour industries in the Xi'an area. After the GuiSui Power Plant is completed, the power generation will increase by more than a quarter compared to before, which can supply electricity for important projects and industrial construction such as the electric saw processing plant, the XinSheng Iron Factory, and the cement tile manufacturing factory that were built last year. After the completion of the construction project of China's largest new brick and tile factory—the Beijing Local State-owned Doudian Brick and Tile Factory—it can produce 140 million bricks annually for the brick item alone, which can be used to build 195 three-story buildings with a width of 15 meters and a length of 40 meters.
    Many new enterprises have been put into production, which plays a significant role in meeting the needs of the broad masses of people. For example, after the expansion project of the Fuxin Thermal Power Plant is fully completed, the power generation capacity can supply all the electricity for a general city with a population of 1.5 million. The second new-type textile factory built in the Northwest Region—the State-owned Northwest Second Cotton Textile Factory—officially started production on December 27 last year. Its start of production will increase the proportion of the socialist economic component in the Northwest textile industry from the original 58 percent to more than 70 percent; the cloth produced each year can supply 13 million people with a new set of clothes each. The Tianjin Winery can produce 5,800 tons of wine annually. After the Huangyuan Power Plant in Qinghai Province generated electricity, the entire city was brightly lit, and people of all ethnic groups were delighted. After the completion of the Chengdu-Aba Highway in Sichuan Province, the fraternal ethnic groups in western Sichuan can buy cheaper industrial daily necessities and can sell their local specialties.

    我国执行第一个五年计划的重大胜利
    一九五三年重点工程完成计划
    【本报讯】在我国五年计划的第一个年度里，许多基本建设工程提前完成了年度计划，不少新建的企业纷纷投入生产。对于我国社会主义工业化起决定作用的重工业建设方面，鞍山钢铁公司自动化大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、第七号炼铁炉已正式开工生产；国营马鞍山铁厂改建成功的六座小型炼铁炉，也在年前全部投入生产。机械系统正在建设的第一汽车制造厂、量具刃具厂、第一机床厂和风动工具厂四大工程，已完成一九五三年年度计划；我国第一个规模巨大的大型电机厂的建筑工程，已在去年十月二十日完工，今年将继续进行机械设备安装工程，八、九月间可以局部投入生产。燃料工业系统去年已有五对竖井工程完工，今年即将投入生产。丰满、西安、郑州、迪化、归绥、巴音浩特、湟源等大中小型的发电站已陆续开始发电。重庆五○七电力厂工程土木建筑已基本完成，整个工厂将在今年三月投入生产。东北区二十二万伏超高压送电线路的九百一十九座铁塔混凝土基础工程，已在封冻前胜利完成。现在正在建筑的太原电热厂，已于去年十一月二十四日，提前一天完成了主厂房工地两万零五十多立方公尺的土方工程。纺织工业系统去年有十个新建和扩建厂投入了生产。轻工业系统去年完成全部建厂工程的有紫泥糖厂、天津酿酒厂、石家庄酿酒厂以及中央度量衡厂；完成第一期扩建工程的有广州造纸厂、自贡制盐新厂，这些工厂已经或将陆续投入生产。此外，铁道系统的重点工程如兰新路的兰肃段、宝成路的成略段已超额完成一九五三年计划，沙丰线、汤林线等都已完成了一九五三年度的建设任务。
    中央人民政府重工业部的基本建设计划已全部完成，其他各工业部门的基本建设计划平均完成百分之九十五以上。许多省市的基本建设工程，也都提前完成任务。东北区沈阳市、哈尔滨市、旅大市、黑龙江省已胜利地完成了一九五三年的建筑工程任务。华北区去年建筑工程计划已于年前基本完成，据山西、河北、绥远三省和北京、天津二市的不完全统计，已完成五百多万平方公尺的建筑工程。华东建筑工程公司第三工程处承包的三十九个建筑工程已全部竣工。中南区国营煤矿管理局所属局、矿已基本上完成了一九五三年的基本建设任务。四川省去年扩建的矿井已全部完工，新建矿井预计今年二三月就可投入生产。为了适应国家经济建设和满足城乡物资交流的需要，四川省去年新建、改建和恢复的公路有十七条，共长一千零八十公里，这些工程绝大部分在年前完工。西北石油管理总局、淮南矿务局、抚顺矿务局、焦作矿务局、井陉矿务局、云南东川矿务局、井岗山铁矿等钻探公司和钻探队，及四川省石油勘探队都提前完成了地质、钻探任务。
    这些基本建设工程提前完工，是我国执行五年建设计划的一大胜利，也是我国工人阶级对祖国实现社会主义工业化的重大贡献。鞍钢大型轧钢厂、无缝钢管厂、第七号炼铁炉以及去年三月投入生产的第八号炼铁炉正式投入生产后，将使鞍山的生铁生产能力提高百分之六十以上，钢材的生产能力提高百分之四十到六十左右。这些产品产量的显著增加，将大大有助于全国工业、农业、交通运输业的发展。新建大型电机厂投入生产后，就可生产我国建设急需的各种大型电机，包括一万瓩、一万六千瓩的水轮发电机。西安第二发电厂输送的电力和西安市原有的电力汇合成一个统一的电力网，能充分供应西安地区新兴的棉纺织、机械和面粉等工业的用电。归绥发电厂建成后，发电量比以前增加了四分之一多，可以供应去年建设的电锯加工厂、新生铁工厂、水泥瓦制造厂等重要工程及工业建设用电。我国新建的最大的砖瓦厂——北京市地方国营窦店砖瓦厂的建筑工程全部建成后，仅砖一项每年就能出产一亿四千万块，能用来建造十五公尺宽、四十公尺长的三层建筑物一百九十五幢。
    许多新的企业投入生产后，对满足广大人民生活的需要起着很大作用。如阜新火力发电厂扩建工程全部完工后，发电能力可以供给一个一百五十万人口的一般城市的全部用电。西北区新建的第二座新型纺织厂——国营西北第二棉纺织厂，已在去年十二月二十七日正式开工生产。它的开工生产将使西北纺织工业中社会主义经济成分的比重，从原来的百分之五十八提高到七十以上；每年生产的布匹，可以供给一千三百万人各添一套新衣。天津酿酒厂每年可产酒五千八百吨。青海省湟源电厂发电后，全城灯光明亮，各族人民都欢欣鼓舞。四川省成阿公路修通后，川西兄弟民族可以买到较便宜的工业日用品，又可以将本区的土特产销售出去。
