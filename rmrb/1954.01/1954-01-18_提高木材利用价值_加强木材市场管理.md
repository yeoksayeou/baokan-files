    Increase the Utilization Value of Timber
    Strengthen the Management of the Timber Market
    Reader Zhang Chaozong writes: Currently, many private merchants in Tianjin possess large quantities of fourth-grade timber and substandard timber from Northeast China, which they sell at inflated prices. This timber is sold by units and cooperatives affiliated with various forest industry bureaus and lumber bureaus in Northeast China, and most of it is transported to Tianjin by the selling units on behalf of the merchants. For example, the Dadong Timber Company in Tianjin purchased more than 500 cubic meters of four-meter-long substandard red and white pine logs from the Yichun Forest Industry Bureau at a price of 120,000 yuan per cubic meter; after processing in Tianjin, the selling price per foot is 47.66 percent higher than the listed price of first-grade medium-sized boards (four to five meters) from the timber company. Defeng and Taidong Timber Companies in Tianjin purchased 2,000 cubic meters of rough-edged red and white pine boards (1.5 meters long by 1.8 cm thick) from the Harbin Lumber Industry Bureau at a price of 210,000 yuan per cubic meter; ten train cars of this lumber have already been transported to Tianjin and are being sold at high prices. The United Cooperative of the Tieli County Cooperative in Heilongjiang Province has successively sold 106 cubic meters of four-meter-long, 30 cm or more in diameter, substandard red and white pine, linden, and ash logs to Tianjin merchant Yin Jiqing. The Haolianghe Cooperative in Songjiang Province sold 77 cubic meters of two- to eight-meter-long firewood-grade red and white pine to the Lilirong and Yongxingcheng Lumber Factories in Tianjin and is responsible for arranging transportation wagons. This situation has created chaos in the timber sales market in Tianjin.

    Timber is one of the important building materials. The forestry industry departments should strictly manage the timber market to ensure the needs of national construction. Fourth-grade timber should be processed in a planned way and used as building materials on the basis of ensuring quality and quantity, and then be allocated uniformly. Substandard timber should also be processed and utilized as much as possible in accordance with the principle of saving timber. As for firewood timber, which has no utilization value in construction, it should also be directly allocated to users during distribution, and blind trafficking should be strictly prevented, so as to avoid wasting transportation capacity and affecting the stability of the sales market.

    Editor's note: The fact that private merchants are trafficking timber into the customs area and disrupting the market is indeed true. The Central Ministry of Forestry has accepted this suggestion from the reader and instructed the Northeast Forest Industry Administration to handle it according to the following principles: First, in accordance with the spirit of increasing production and practicing economy, strengthen the processing of substandard timber in timber storage yards to transform substandard timber into standard timber for allocation purposes; second, if the backlog of all substandard timber cannot be resolved after processing, the Timber Allocation Bureau may make unified plans to allocate it to timber companies for civilian use; third, promptly instruct all production units to immediately stop selling timber to private merchants; for timber already sold to private merchants, those that have not yet been shipped should have their certificates for transporting it into the customs area revoked, so that they can be sold in Northeast China at local market prices, so as to prevent private merchants from transporting timber into the customs area to speculate and obtain exorbitant profits.

### 提高木材利用价值  加强木材市场管理

专栏：读者来信摘要

    提高木材利用价值
    加强木材市场管理
    读者张朝宗来信：目前天津不少私商拥有大量的东北四等材和等外材，抬高价格出售。这些木材都是东北各森林工业局、制材局所属单位和合作社售出的，其中大部分并由出售单位代为运到天津。例如，天津大东木行向伊春森林工业局购买四公尺等外材红白松原木五百多立方公尺，每立方公尺价格是十二万元；到天津加工后每呎售价竟高出木材公司四至五公尺中板一等材牌价的百分之四十七点六六。天津德丰、泰东木行等在哈尔滨制材工业局购买一点五公尺乘一点八公分以下的毛边红白松板材二千立方公尺，每层积立方公尺价格二十一万元；现在已有十车运到天津，高价出售。黑龙江省铁骊县合作社联合社先后售给天津行商尹基庆四公尺乘三十公分以上等外材红白松、椴、水曲柳原木一百零六立方公尺；松江省浩良河合作社售给天津立利荣、永兴成木厂二至八公尺薪炭材红白松七十七立方公尺，并负责代办运输车皮。这种情况，造成天津市木材销售市场的混乱。
    木材是重要建筑材料之一，森林工业部门应该严格管理木材市场，保证国家建设的需要。对四等材应该有计划地加工，在保质保量的基础上取作建筑材料，然后统一调配；对于等外材也应根据节约木材的原则，尽量加工利用；至于建筑上毫无利用价值的薪炭材，在分配时也要直接调拨给使用户，严格防止盲目贩运，造成运输力的浪费和影响销售市场的稳定。
    编者按：私商贩运木材进关扰乱市场一事，确属事实。中央林业部已接受读者这一建议，责成东北森林工业管理局按以下几个原则处理：一，根据增产节约的精神，加强贮木场等外材的加工，变等外材为等内材，作为调拨任务；二，加工后还不能解决全部等外材的积压时，可由木材调配局统一筹划，调给木材公司供给民用；三，迅速指示各生产单位，立即停止将木材售给私商；已售给私商的木材，凡未起运的，应取消其运进关内的证明，使其在东北按当地市价出售，以免私商把木材运进关来，投机获取暴利。
