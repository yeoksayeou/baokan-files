    Xinmin County State-Owned Department Store Wholesale Department and Cooperatives
    Sign First Quarter Supply Contract This Year
    The State-Owned Department Store of Xinmin County, Liaoxi Province, held a meeting with 18 grassroots cooperatives in the wholesale department's supply area in late December last year and signed a material supply contract for the first quarter of this year.
    During the meeting, the business group leaders and purchasing agents of the grassroots cooperatives were organized to visit the sample room and warehouse. The business group leaders registered while watching and discussed the contract with the purchasing agents in detail before signing it. The Bailing Cooperative in the cotton and grain producing area purchased more than seven times the amount of cloth compared to the fourth quarter of last year; the Daliutun Cooperative, which did not operate tea much, ordered 80 jin after seeing the samples; the urban cooperative found bone-handled knives and ordered five dozen. Through this meeting, the 18 grassroots cooperatives finalized supply contracts for 334 kinds of goods worth 6.09 billion yuan, equivalent to 29 percent of the wholesale department's annual sales plan.
    This kind of meeting where the wholesale department and the grassroots cooperatives sign supply contracts is very popular. In the discussion, the employees of the cooperative said: It is so good to sign contracts like this. We guarantee to implement them because the contracts are signed by ourselves. We have a clear idea in our minds and we will definitely be able to implement them. (Dong Yu, Zhang Di)

    新民县国营百货批发部和合作社
    签订今年第一季度供应合同
    辽西省新民县国营百货公司，在去年十二月下旬与批发部供应区十八个基层社举行会议，签订了今年第一季度物资供应合同。
    会议中，组织基层社营业组长、采购员参观样品室和仓库。营业组长们边看边登记，并和采购员具体商量，签订合同。棉粮产区的白岭合作社购买布匹的数量超过去年第四季度的七倍；大柳屯合作社不大经营茶叶，看了样子就订了八十斤；城市合作社发现了骨把刀，订了五打。通过这次会议，十八个基层社订妥了三百三十四种价值六十亿九千多万元的供应合同，等于批发部年度推销计划的百分之二十九。
    这种批发部和基层合作社签订供应合同的会议很受欢迎。座谈中合作社的职工说：这样订合同太好啦，我们保证执行，因为合同是我们自己订的，心里有了数，一定能执行。（董宇、张涤）
