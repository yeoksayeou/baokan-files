Taiping Village, Yuwu Township, Rongchang County
Ensuring Both Grain Procurement and Production are Uninterrupted

In Taiping Village, Yuwu Township, Rongchang County, Sichuan Province, the work of procuring grain has been combined with the promotion of the general line, ensuring that both grain procurement and production are uninterrupted. In about ten days, the villagers not only sold more than 40,000 jin of surplus grain to the state but also harvested all the sugarcane and sweet potatoes, planted peas, rapeseed, and vegetables, replanted missing seedlings in the wheat fields, and plowed the winter paddy fields twice. Some mutual aid teams have even applied three top dressings to the wheat and rapeseed fields. In addition to purchasing cattle, farm tools, and fertilizer with the money from selling grain, the villagers also deposited more than 19 million yuan in the bank for use during spring plowing this year.

On November 12th last year, when the village held an expanded cadre meeting to study the general line and arrange grain work, it studied the village's production work based on the Sichuan Provincial People's Government's "Instructions on Strengthening Leadership in Winter Agricultural Production." After the meeting, while vigorously publicizing the general line to the farmers and the great significance of selling surplus grain to the state, the cadres also emphasized the principle that doing a good job in production and increasing more grain was a practical action to support national construction. In addition, in the specific arrangement of procurement work, the production of the farmers was taken into consideration as much as possible. The village cadres also paid attention to seizing spare time to do their own production, in order to motivate the masses. Therefore, after hearing the publicity of the general line, the masses actively sold surplus grain while actively engaging in production. Farmer Peng Dengyun's wheat field lacked fertilizer, and he originally planned to let it go, but after hearing the publicity, he knew that in order to increase production and sell more grain to the state, he had to rush to the street to carry manure whenever he had time.

Before and after the grain was stored, the village specially held two symposiums for grain sellers, organizing everyone to discuss how to use the money from selling grain to expand reproduction, and commended Tan Yicheng, Liao Yifang, and others who did well in this regard. In the late stage of grain procurement work, the cadres shifted their main efforts to leading production. They first focused on going deep into the Hu Qizhang Mutual Aid Team to assist the team in formulating a winter production plan, and then held a villagers' meeting to introduce experience and call on the whole village to learn from it. This motivated other mutual aid teams such as Fan Haiqing to formulate winter production plans. (Xinhua News Agency report)

### 荣昌县御侮乡太平村  做到购粮生产两不误

    荣昌县御侮乡太平村
    做到购粮生产两不误
    四川省荣昌县御侮乡太平村结合宣传总路线开展购粮工作中，做到了购粮、生产两不误。在十天左右时间内，全村农民除把四万多斤余粮卖给国家外，还收完了全部甘蔗、红薯，种上了豌豆，菜籽和蔬菜，补种了小麦缺窝，冬水田已耖完二道。有些互助组并已在小麦、菜籽田里施过了三次追肥。全村卖粮农民除了添置耕牛、农具、肥料外，还在银行里储蓄了一千九百多万元，准备今年春耕生产时使用。
    去年十一月十二日，该村在召开扩大干部会议学习总路线和布置粮食工作时，就根据四川省人民政府“关于加强冬季农业生产领导”的指示，研究了全村的生产工作。会后，干部在大力向农民宣传总路线和把余粮卖给国家的重大意义的同时，还着重向农民讲清做好生产，增加更多粮食是支援国家建设的实际行动的道理。此外，在具体安排收购工作上，尽量照顾农民生产。村干部也注意抓紧空暇时间，搞好自己生产，以带动群众。因此，群众在听了总路线的宣传后，一面积极出售余粮，同时积极生产。农民彭登云，小麦地里的肥料不足，原来他准备拖过算了，听过宣传后，他知道要把生产搞好，才能增产更多的粮食卖给国家，他一有空就赶到街上去挑粪。
    粮食入仓前后，该村又特地召开了两次卖粮户座谈会，组织大家讨论如何把卖粮款项用于扩大再生产，并表扬了在这方面做得好的谭易成、廖奕芳等人。在购粮工作末期，干部就将主要力量转向领导生产。他们首先重点深入胡其章互助组协助该组订出冬季生产计划，然后召开村民大会，介绍经验，号召全村学习。这样带动了樊海清等其他互助组也订出了冬季生产计划。（据新华社讯）
