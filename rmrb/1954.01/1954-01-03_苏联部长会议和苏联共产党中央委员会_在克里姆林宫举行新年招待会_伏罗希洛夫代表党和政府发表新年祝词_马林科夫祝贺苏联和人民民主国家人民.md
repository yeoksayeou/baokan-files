Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 1st - TASS dispatch from Moscow, 1st: The Council of Ministers of the USSR and the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union held a New Year's reception in the Kremlin on December 31st.

    Gathered in the St. George Hall of the Kremlin were: Soviet government personnel, members of the Central Committee of the CPSU, deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, deputies of the Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation, prominent figures from Moscow's industrial enterprises and construction projects, outstanding agricultural workers, representatives of the Soviet Army, and representatives from the fields of science and culture.

    The attendees warmly welcomed the New Year's greetings from K.Y. Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR.

    G.M. Malenkov congratulated the great Soviet people, the wise Communist Party, congratulated the working class and the collective farmers, congratulated their unbreakable alliance, congratulated the heroic Soviet Armed Forces, congratulated the peaceful policies of the Soviet state, and congratulated the workers in science, art, and literature. At this point, the entire hall erupted in stormy applause.

    The attendees enthusiastically applauded when congratulating the friendly, great Chinese people and the working people of the People's Democratic countries.

    The reception vividly demonstrated the rock-solid unity of the Party, the government, and the Soviet people.

    A grand artistic performance was also held at the reception. The performers included the best actors from Moscow, Leningrad, and Kyiv.

    Xinhua News Agency, 2nd - TASS dispatch from Moscow, 1st: K.Y. Voroshilov, Chairman of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, delivered New Year's greetings to the Soviet people, the full text of which is as follows:

    Dear comrades! Dear citizens of the great Soviet Union!

    Workers, both men and women! Collective farm members, both men and women! Soviet intellectuals! Soldiers of our armed forces! Glorious Soviet youth! I extend to you my New Year's greetings!

    In the year 1953, which is about to pass, the Soviet people tirelessly worked for their beloved motherland with remarkable success.

    Thanks to the inexhaustible energy of the working people of our country, the Fifth Five-Year Plan for developing the national economy is being victoriously implemented. No matter what conspiracies the enemies of socialism abroad and at home may engage in, the strength of the Soviet state is constantly growing. Our socialist motherland is becoming richer and more beautiful. The material well-being and cultural level of the people throughout the Soviet Union are constantly improving.

    The friendship of all nationalities of our great motherland is as solid as a rock. The fraternal alliance of the working class and the peasantry is consolidated, and the spiritual and political unity of Soviet society is unshakeable.

    The Communist Party of the Soviet Union—powerful because it is loved and trusted by the working people—holds high the victorious banner of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, uniting and guiding all the forces and energies of the people to build a communist society.

    The supreme goal of the Communist Party and the Soviet government is to care for the vital needs of the people and to make our motherland—a strong bastion of the constantly strengthening friendship of all nationalities—prosperous and strong.

    Our Party and government are using all their strength to strengthen the power of the socialist state and improve the welfare of the Soviet people. The famous resolutions passed by the Fifth Session of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and the September Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, as well as the various resolutions passed by our government in 1953 regarding agriculture, the production of daily necessities, and the expansion of Soviet trade, are fundamentally in the spirit of caring for the well-being and happiness of the people.

    The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government firmly believe that our people, who are building a communist society, will execute these important resolutions with their inherent creativity.

    The Soviet people, engaged in construction labor, advocate peace and safeguard the cause of peace. Our desire to ensure peace among nations is the rock-solid foundation of the Soviet government's foreign policy, which it has consistently pursued and will steadfastly continue to pursue in accordance with the will of its people.

    The great Chinese people, the working people of the People's Democratic countries, and the millions of ordinary, honest people in capitalist countries are working selflessly alongside the Soviet Union in the united camp of warriors for the great cause of world peace.

    The Soviet people—the masters of their great, happy motherland—are full of confidence in their strength and are joyfully and energetically welcoming the New Year of 1954.

    Dear comrades, on the occasion of the New Year, I extend to you my heartfelt congratulations on behalf of our Party Central Committee and the Soviet government. May this year bring even greater achievements in production, the power of our motherland be constantly strengthened, and its defense capabilities be further consolidated! May the material and cultural level of all Soviet people be further raised this year.

    May international tensions be further eased this year, and may the cause of striving for a stable and lasting peace throughout the world achieve great success!

    Dear comrades, I wish you a happy New Year.
