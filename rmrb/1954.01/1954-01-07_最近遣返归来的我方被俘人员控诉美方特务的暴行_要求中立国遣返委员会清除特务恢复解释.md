Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 6th -- Among the 128 Chinese People's Volunteer Army returnees repatriated on New Year's Eve, 86 came from Prisoner of War (POW) camps No. 4 and No. 7 in Dongchang-ri. Some personnel in Camp No. 4 had the chance to hear explanations, but Camp No. 7 never had the opportunity. Returnees from both camps unanimously demanded that the Neutral Nations Repatriation Committee break the special agents' control over the POWs, extend the explanation time, and quickly rescue their companions awaiting repatriation.

    A group from Camp No. 4 heard an explanation on December 23rd of last year. At that time, eleven people boldly applied for repatriation. During roll call by the Indian troops on December 31st, another thirty-nine from this camp risked their lives to rush out of the barbed wire gate to request repatriation, including four who had heard the explanation.

    Returnees who escaped from Camp No. 4 said: On December 22nd of last year, when the POWs heard that it was their turn to hear explanations from relatives in their homeland the next day, they were secretly happy. Some even said privately, "The days of suffering are coming to an end." Song Furen, who has already returned, kept his eyes fixed on the big red gate of Panmunjom to the north (i.e., the archway for the Chinese and Korean side to welcome returnees), and secretly said to a close comrade: "Tomorrow, as long as we see people from the motherland, no matter how the special agents threaten us, we will tell them all the suffering we have endured, even if we die, we will be content."

    However, that evening, Zhao Xingchang, the head of the special agents in Camp No. 4, said: "There's only one day left for the Communist interrogation (explanation), so only half of us need to go...." Then, Zhao Xingchang selected the squad and platoon leaders and so-called "reliable elements" to go to hear the explanation. The remaining people were all sad and dejected, looking at each other with expressions of despair. Some, fearing that they would be discovered by the special agents if they showed their sadness, covered their heads and pretended to sleep. Liu Deyuan, who has now returned, said that he was so sad at the time that he did not eat for three days. One POW could not help but curse: "America is always talking about being a free world, so why won't they let us go hear the explanation?" The special agent heard this and immediately picked up an iron bar and beat him senseless.

    Zhang Zhongyan, a returnee, said that on December 23rd of last year, he walked out of his tent, staring straight at the barbed wire, wanting to risk his life to climb out and apply for repatriation. At this time, his comrade Jiang Yuxiang (already repatriated) winked at him and pulled him back into the tent, telling him: "Hang in there, the motherland will persist in continuing the explanations, and then we will leave together!" But in the evening, the special agents escorted the people who had heard the explanation back to the camp and clamored that there would be no more explanations forever, and that the Indians would no longer care about repatriation.

    On the morning of the 31st, when the Indian guarding troops came to the barbed wire gate of the camp for roll call, thirty-nine people rushed out regardless. Liu Deyuan, a returnee, was grabbed by a special agent with a knife just before he rushed out of the barbed wire gate. He reacted quickly and punched the special agent, who dodged, and Liu Deyuan rushed out of the gate.

    During the roll call by the Indian troops, forty-seven people escaped from Camp No. 7. Together with the six people who had been repatriated earlier, fifty-three people from this camp have returned to the embrace of their motherland.

    According to people returning from Camp No. 7: Three days before the roll call by the Indian guarding troops, the special agents knew about it. Song Shulin, the captain of the special agents, conducted a secret review of the POWs, deployed special agent henchmen with knives to monitor the POWs who had expressed a desire to return home, and constantly threatened the POWs, saying: "Anyone who tries to escape will be killed if caught." On the day of the roll call, the POWs went through the barbed wire passage with terror and tension to accept the roll call. Zuo Luying, who had been tormented into skin and bones by more than two years of POW camp life, suddenly mustered up courage and rushed out at the entrance of the camp. Li Guiheng, another captured soldier who had pretended to be lame for two years in the POW camp, desperately rushed out of the gate when he arrived at the camp entrance, regardless of the special agents with knives monitoring him in front and behind. After the captured personnel escaped from the tiger's mouth one after another, the special agents also threw stones to hit them. The vast majority of POWs lost the opportunity to escape and were driven back into the barbed wire by the special agents.

    The escaped and returned POWs unanimously called on the Neutral Nations Repatriation Committee to quickly remove the U.S. special agents in the POW camps, resume the explanation work, and give the POWs the opportunity to apply for repatriation.

    最近遣返归来的我方被俘人员控诉美方特务的暴行
    要求中立国遣返委员会清除特务恢复解释
    【新华社开城六日电】在去年除夕遣返归来的一百二十八名中国人民志愿军归来人员中，从东场里第四号和第七号营场出来的就占了八十六名。第四号营场曾经有一部分人听过解释，第七号营场则从未获得听解释的机会。这两个营场的归来人员一致要求中立国遣返委员会打破特务对战俘的控制，补足解释时间，赶快解救那些等待遣返机会的同伴们。
    第四号营场的一部分人在去年十二月二十三日听过一次解释，当时大胆申请遣返的有十一人。在十二月三十一日印度部队点名时，这个营场里冒死冲出铁丝网大门要求遣返的又有三十九名，其中有四个人是听过解释的。
    从第四号营场逃出的归来人员说：去年十二月二十二日，当战俘听说第二天就轮到他们去听祖国亲人解释的时候，都暗暗高兴，有的还私下说：“受苦的日子可熬到头了。”已经归来的宋福仁那天两眼直盯着北边板门店的大红门（按即朝中方面迎接归来人员的牌楼），并且偷偷地对知心的难友说：“明天只要见到祖国的人，不管特务怎样威胁我们，我们要把所受的痛苦统统诉说出来，就是死了也甘心。”
    但是，这天晚上，第四号营场的特务头子赵兴昌说：“共产党的审问（解释）只剩下明天一天了，我们只去一半人就行啦……。”然后赵兴昌就挑选了各中、小队长和所谓“可靠分子”准备去听解释。剩下的人都愁眉苦脸，你看着我，我看着你，露出绝望的表情。有的恐怕自己表现出难过的样子被特务发觉，就蒙头假装睡觉。这次归来的刘德元说，他当时难过得三天没有吃饭。有一个战俘竟忍不住大骂道：“美国口口声声说它是自由世界，为什么不叫我们去听解释呢？”特务听到后立即拿起铁棍就没头没脑地砸他，把他打昏在地。
    归来的张忠彦说，他在去年十二月二十三日曾走出帐篷，两眼直瞪着铁丝网，想冒死爬出去申请遣返。这时，他的难友姜玉祥（已遣返）向他使了一个眼色，把他拉回帐篷后对他说：“熬一熬吧，祖国会坚持来继续解释的，那时我们一起走！”可是到了晚上，特务们又押着听过解释的人回到了营场，并大肆叫嚣说，以后永远没有解释了，印度人也不再管遣返的事情了。
    三十一日早上，印度看管部队来到该营场铁丝网大门旁点名时，就有三十九个人不顾一切地冲了出来。归来的刘德元在要冲出铁丝网大门之前，被手拿刀子的特务一把拉住。他急中生智，向那特务打了一拳，特务一躲闪，他就冲出了大门。
    在印度部队点名时，从第七号营场逃出来的有四十七人，连同以前先后遣返的六人，这个营场已有五十三人重回祖国怀抱。
    据从第七号营场归来的人说：在印度看管部队点名前三天，特务们就知道了。特务大队长宋书林在战俘中进行了一次秘密审查，布置了带刀子的特务爪牙监视曾流露过回国愿望的战俘，并不断地威胁战俘说：“谁要逃跑，抓回来就杀死。”在点名那天，战俘们怀着恐怖而紧张的心情通过铁丝网的夹道接受点名。被两年多的战俘营生活折磨得皮包骨头的左屡盈，走到营场门口就突然鼓足勇气冲了出来。另一个在战俘营中装了两年瘸子的被俘人员李桂恒，不管前面和后面有拿刀子的特务监视他，到营场门口时也拚命冲出了大门。在被俘人员一个又一个逃出虎口以后，特务们还投掷石头去打他们。绝大多数战俘失去逃走的机会，都被特务赶回铁丝网里去了。
    脱险归来的被俘人员一致呼吁中立国遣返委员会赶快清除战俘营中的美方特务，恢复解释工作，让战俘们有申请遣返的机会。
