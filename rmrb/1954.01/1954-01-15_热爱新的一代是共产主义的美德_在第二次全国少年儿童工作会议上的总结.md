Comrades:

At this conference, Commander-in-Chief Zhu gave important instructions on children's work; Comrade Hu Ke Shi, on behalf of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, made a report on "Cultivating Socialist New People"; Deputy Minister Dong of the Ministry of Education and Soviet education expert Comrade Trukhanov also gave us many instructions and methods; and many excellent counselors made typical speeches and introduced many experiences. With guidelines, methods, and experiences, it should be said that this conference has been very fruitful and will have a significant impact on further developing children's work in the future.

As the people of our country, under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, are striving to gradually realize the country's socialist industrialization and gradually transition to socialism, children's work must also advance under the guidance of the general line of the transition period. The Communist Youth League, as the Party's assistant, must be good at assisting the Party in educating children in the spirit of communism and cultivating the new generation into socialist new people.

First of all, we should actively, patiently, and continuously promote the necessity of cherishing and caring for children. Schools have the primary responsibility for cultivating and educating children. The Young Pioneers is a capable assistant to the school, but this work cannot be done well without the cooperation of society and the family. Therefore, the work of cultivating and educating the new generation requires many people to care and cooperate in all aspects. Only in this way can children's work have favorable conditions. The best and most effective way to win more people to cherish and care for children is to do propaganda work. Explain clearly to the people that our Party and our new society cherish and care for children, while only the old society does not care for children and despises children.

Why did the old society not care for children, while our new society cherishes and cares for children?

We know that in the old society, whether it was the landlord class or the bourgeoisie, these exploiters were all selfish and self-interested. Their enjoyment was built on bloody rule, and they only cared about themselves and only planned how to exploit more and enjoy more. Of course, these exploiting classes would not care for and cherish children, nor would they think about the future of all mankind. Even if they ran some schools, it was only to cultivate their own children for their own benefit or to try to train some slaves for them to use. Not only that, but even the petty bourgeoisie in the old era did not cherish their children. This was because they were unable to raise their children in their desperate lives, and they were even more worried about having children. Even if they cared about their children, they only hoped that their children would be able to support them in their old age, because they could not see their own future, let alone the future of their children. Therefore, the old society did not care for children. They despised children. Their bodies and minds were often devastated.

However, the new society is completely different. In Chinese history, there has never been a party and Chairman Mao who loved and cared for children as much as our Party and Chairman Mao. Because our Party regards people as the most precious wealth of mankind. Our Party completely connects the cultivation and education of the new generation with the development prospects of the new society. In order to realize the great ideal of communism, our Party has led the people in outstanding struggles and will continue to struggle for the gradual transition to socialism. This struggle has opened up the most beautiful future for the happiness of our descendants. Our revolutionary martyrs struggled hard for the cause of communism, and they did not hesitate to sacrifice their lives. This is because they firmly believed that the revolution would surely win, communism would surely be realized, and the next generation would surely be happy. Our happiness today is created by our predecessors. Our continued struggle and work today will enable our descendants to enjoy greater happiness. After our descendants grow up, they will take over our cause and advance communism to its final victory. Comrades, the cause of communism is an unprecedentedly difficult and great cause in human history, and it is also a long-term cause. It cannot be completed by our generation alone. This cause must be passed on to our descendants, our children and grandchildren, and our children and grandchildren must pass it on from generation to generation. To ensure that our great cause can be inherited and that human society reaches an unprecedentedly high level of happiness, we must cultivate and educate children well now. Therefore, cultivating and educating the new generation is one of the fundamental undertakings of communism. Cherishing children and educating children is a task of national significance and a communist virtue of the people of New China. Anyone who cares about the future of our socialism and communism will naturally care about the growth of the new generation.

However, not everyone understands these principles. The psychology of despising children's education left over from old China has not been changed as it should be. At present, there are still many people in society who despise children, despise primary school teachers, and despise children's work. There are also some young people who are unwilling to be primary school teachers. The so-called "having three measures of grain at home is not as good as being the king of children" means that working with children is considered to be one level lower than other jobs. This has become an obstacle to further developing children's work. Therefore, we need to use propaganda methods to change this old society's psychology of despising children's education, to win more people to care for children, and to win those who are directly responsible for children's education to emit greater light and heat for cultivating the new generation of the motherland. However, if we only promote the necessity of cherishing and caring for children without publicizing the correct methods of cherishing and educating children to the broad masses of the people, then our children's work will still not be done well. Because not everyone's educational views and methods are in line with Marxism-Leninism. Those feudal and bourgeois views and methods often play a role in children's education.

Where do the correct Marxist-Leninist educational methods come from? It comes from the guidelines for cultivating and educating children. Our guideline is to cultivate today's children into outstanding builders of socialism. In socialist society, production has greatly advanced compared to the present. Large-scale industries with a high technical foundation have replaced technologically backward industries and handicrafts. Tractors will replace today's hoes and old-fashioned plows. In socialist society, all phenomena of exploitation will be eliminated, and private ownership of the means of production will be replaced by ownership by the whole people and collective ownership. Labor will become a glorious, heroic, and brave undertaking, and the interests of the collective will be above all else. In socialist society, the people's cultural living standards will also be greatly improved, and the people's thoughts, behaviors, and feelings will become unprecedentedly noble. Therefore, the builders of socialism must be new-type people with a high level of cultural and scientific knowledge, communist moral qualities, and a healthy physique. In other words, we should cultivate today's children into a new generation that is all-round developed, loves the motherland, loves the people, loves labor, loves science, cherishes public property, and is healthy, lively, brave, and honest.

Now that we have the guidelines, how should we carry out education? I think:

First of all, we must vigorously guide children to study hard so that they can gradually and firmly grasp knowledge. Knowledge is power. Lenin said:
	“Only by enriching your mind with all the knowledge treasures created by mankind can you become a communist.” Therefore, in childhood, we should lay a good foundation of knowledge for them so that they can continuously develop their talents in the process of mastering knowledge and gradually form a communist worldview. Schools are the main places for carrying out communist education for children. The Young Pioneers should closely cooperate with schools to carry out activities. And we must be good at using various methods to induce children to love learning. Comrade Ren Bishi's words to his children in the past were very good: "Children must study hard, it will be useless if you don't learn now." We must let children understand: if you want to build the motherland in the future, you must study hard and master knowledge today.

We must always pay attention to inspiring children's enthusiasm for loving the motherland and the people, and stimulate them to establish lofty ideals and aspirations. Patriotism is a powerful driving force for promoting the development of our country. It awakens our people to always prepare their strength to carry out outstanding struggles for the construction of the motherland. Stalin said: Great power is generated in the pursuit of great purposes. Therefore, it is extremely important to educate children with patriotism. We should always publicize that the motherland is the most lovable, and that those who defend the motherland and those who work bravely, diligently, and selflessly for the motherland are the most lovable. Make children study hard in order to build communism. Make children understand that they should do things for the country and the people, instead of being selfish and self-interested for personal gain, so that they can firmly establish their lofty ideals.

We must conscientiously pay attention to cultivating children's love for labor and gradually cultivate good labor habits in them. Labor education is one of the fundamental contents of our communist education for children. The victory of communism is also the victory of labor. To socialist and communist society means that everyone labors and everyone enjoys. Kalinin said it well: "Not only should you love labor, but you should also treat labor honestly. You should firmly remember: if a person lives, only eats and does not work, then he is corroding the labor of others." I heard that some children said after visiting factories that they would not become workers when they grew up because the work in factories was too heavy and dirty. This shows that there are still problems in our education. We still cannot make children understand that all beautiful things are created by labor. Only labor can industrialize the country and can make the people have the happiest life. Isn't it very clear that it is impossible to become a person who is useful to the country and beneficial to the people if you do not love labor? However, cultivating children's love for labor does not mean using children as labor. Any practice of letting children bear adult labor is wrong, because it is beyond their ability and harmful to their health. Therefore, we should use various methods that are suitable for children's characteristics and within their physical capacity—such as cultivating flowers and trees, making models, collecting specimens, and holding gatherings with workers and farmers—to cultivate children's labor habits.

Promote children's physical exercise in many ways. This is an important method to make children have a healthy body. Childhood is a period of growing knowledge and growing body. Therefore, growing body should also become one of the tasks of children. We should promote various methods to cultivate children to have a healthy body. However, in some places, the restrictions on children's physical education are too strict. For example, swimming and swinging on bars are not allowed. If we want to promote physical education and do not allow a little skin to be scratched, I think this is difficult to do. The problem lies in whether we can correctly guide children's physical activities, rather than simply prohibiting them. Only through continuous exercise can we cultivate a healthy body and a brave character. If we do not do this, but instead ask children to be "gentle and well-behaved," "honest and obedient," "not allowed to laugh when watching plays, and not allowed to jump when walking," wouldn't that turn children into weak, timid, and cowardly people? How can they be able to shoulder the important tasks of building and defending the motherland when they grow up?

We must cultivate children's love and interest in literature and art. Literature and art can improve children's intelligence and enable them to appreciate beautiful things. Literature and art can also help children understand real life, help cultivate their beautiful feelings and strong will, cultivate their ideals and creative abilities, and inspire them to enthusiastically pursue new things and new life. Therefore, we must develop children's interest in literature, music, painting, poetry, and so on.

When educating children, we should grasp two principles: The first is to adhere to long-term positive education, which is the fundamental method of cultivating children. Children are very young, very pure, their physical strength is very weak, their knowledge is very poor, and their ability to distinguish right from wrong is very poor. Therefore, we must patiently and continuously carry out positive education and use positive things to guide them forward. And we must never take rude methods such as hitting, punishing, and struggling. Some people also adopted the policy towards old intellectuals towards children, to win them over, unite them, and transform them. What do children need to transform? This approach is completely wrong. The second is to be good at developing children's independence, initiative, and enthusiasm. Independence and enthusiasm are good qualities that enable people to be non-conformist and non-dependent throughout their lives, and to be optimistic, upward, and bravely fight against difficulties in any difficult situation. Establishing children's own organization—the Young Pioneers—is a good way to develop their independence, initiative, and enthusiasm. In their own organizations, children can gradually get used to collective life, learn to manage themselves, and develop their independent abilities, initiative, and enthusiasm.

Cultivating and educating children is a part of the national construction cause and a part of the entire cause of the Party. The Party and the people have entrusted such an important task to teachers and children's workers. This is the Party and the people's high trust in them and the great honor of teachers and children's workers. To do a good job in cultivating and educating children, we must first rely on the unremitting efforts of children's education workers, rely on the high political enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of children's education workers, and rely on the continuous improvement of children's education workers in their ideological style, politics, and culture, so that they can become role models for children in all aspects. Childhood is the most susceptible period in a person's growth process. Therefore, teachers and children's workers must not only be good at using the deeds of struggle of revolutionary leaders, great men, heroes, and labor models to educate children, but also use their own exemplary behavior to influence children and set examples among children. Only in this way can we successfully complete the glorious tasks entrusted to us by the Party and the people, and cultivate outstanding builders of the new China with noble qualities.

On the children's education front, we currently have more than 1.5 million teachers, 160,000 Young Pioneer counselors, and more than 1,000 cadres who specialize in children's work. The vast majority of these comrades are working hard and have achieved results. Many of them have also done very well. In the past, many teachers have been commended by the Party and the government. At this conference, we will also use the name of the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League and the Second National Conference on Children's Work to reward 83 outstanding counselors and thank them for outstandingly cultivating the future and hope of the country and the people—today's children.

The reason why these comrades do their work well is because they love the work entrusted to them by the Party and the people, and they love children. They pour their heart and soul into their work and cultivate the new generation like an excellent gardener cherishes flowers and trees. At the same time, they also have the greatest courage and determination. With determination, they will delve into it and think of various methods of cultivation and education. The success or failure of a thing depends not only on whether it conforms to the laws of objective development, but also on whether it has sufficient determination. Cultivating and educating children is a new work, and it will inevitably encounter various difficulties. However, in the face of people who are determined to struggle for the cause of the people, and in the face of people who are determined to cultivate new-type people for the Party and the people, no difficulty can scare him or stop him from moving forward. Our excellent teachers and excellent counselors have set a good example in this regard. Their noble qualities of being loyal, working hard, and serving the people and children are worthy of learning, and their experiences are worthy of promotion.

Comrades, there are about 70 to 80 million children aged 9 to 15 in our country. To cultivate this generation well is an arduous and glorious undertaking. I believe that under the close care and leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, and with the active support and assistance of all parties, through everyone's joint efforts, children's work will achieve greater results.

    热爱新的一代是共产主义的美德
    ——在第二次全国少年儿童工作会议上的总结
    胡耀邦
    同志们：
    在这次会议上，朱总司令对少年儿童工作作了重要指示；胡克实同志代表团中央书记处作了“培养社会主义的新人”的报告；教育部董副部长、苏联教育专家崔可夫同志的报告也给了我们很多指示和办法；还有许多优秀的辅导员，作了典型发言，介绍了许多经验。有了方针，有了办法，又有了经验，因此应该说，这次会议很有收获，对今后进一步开展少年儿童工作，将会发生重大的影响。
    当我国人民在党和毛主席的领导下，为逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化，为逐步过渡到社会主义而斗争的新时期中，少年儿童工作也必须在过渡时期总路线的灯塔照耀下前进。作为党的助手的青年团，就要善于协助党以共产主义精神教育少年儿童，将新的一代培养成为社会主义的新人。
    首先我们应该积极地、耐心地和长期地宣传爱护和关心少年儿童的必要性。培养教育儿童，学校负有主要的责任。少年先锋队是学校的得力助手，但是，如果没有社会和家庭的配合教育，这个工作也还做不好。因此培养教育新的一代的工作，是需要许多人从各方面来关心和配合的。只有这样，少年儿童工作才有了有利的条件。争取更多的人来爱护和关心儿童最好的也是最有效的方法，就是做宣传工作。向人民讲清楚我们的党，我们的新社会是爱护和关心儿童的，而只有旧社会才不关心儿童，轻视儿童。
    为什么旧社会不关心儿童，而我们的新社会是爱护和关心儿童的呢？
    我们知道，在旧社会，不论是地主阶级或是资产阶级，这些剥削者，都是自私自利的。他们的享受是建立在血腥的统治上，他们所关心的只是个人，他们所打算的只是如何多剥削一些多享受一些。当然，这些剥削阶级是不会关心和爱护儿童的，也不会为整个人类后代着想的。就是他们办了一些学校，那也只是为了他们的利益来培养自己的儿女，或是企图训练一些供他们使唤的奴隶。不但如此，就是旧时代的小资产阶级，他们也是不爱护孩子的。那是由于在他们绝望的生活中，无力抚育儿女，他们因生儿育女而更加愁苦，即使关心孩子，也只图将来儿女能养老送终，因为他们看不见自己的前途，更看不见孩子的前途。因此，旧社会是不关心孩子们的。轻视孩子的。他们的身心常常遭受到摧残。
    可是，新社会就完全不相同了。在中国历史上，从来没有过像我们的党和毛主席那样的热爱和关心儿童。因为我们的党把人当作人类最宝贵的财富。我们的党把培养教育新一代和新社会的发展前途完全联系在一起。我们的党为了实现伟大的理想——共产主义，曾经领导人民进行了卓越的斗争，今后并继续为逐步过渡到社会主义而斗争。这种斗争就为我们后代的幸福开辟了最美好的前途。我们的革命先烈为共产主义事业艰苦斗争，虽然牺牲自己的生命也在所不惜。这是由于他们深信革命一定会胜利，共产主义一定会实现，后一代一定会幸福。我们今天的幸福，就是先辈们所创造的。我们今天继续斗争，继续工作，就会使我们后代享受到更大的幸福。我们的后代长大以后，将要接替我们的事业，将共产主义推进到最终的胜利。同志们，共产主义事业，是人类历史上空前艰难、空前伟大的事业，也是一个长久的事业，它不是我们这一代人就能完成的。这个事业一定要传给我们的后辈、我们的子孙，我们的子孙还要世世代代地传下去。要保证我们的伟大事业能继承下去，使人类社会达到空前未有的幸福的高度，就要在现在把少年儿童培养和教育好。因此，培养教育新一代，是共产主义的根本事业之一。爱护儿童、教育儿童是具有国家意义的任务，也是新中国人民的一种共产主义的美德。凡是关心我们社会主义和共产主义前途的人，他必然也会很自然地关心新一代的成长。
    但是，并不是所有的人都明白这些道理，旧中国所遗留下来的轻视儿童教育的心理，还未得到应有的转变。目前社会上还有不少的人轻视儿童、轻视小学教师、轻视少年儿童工作。在青年中也有不愿作小学教师的想法，所谓“家有三斗粮，不做小孩王”，认为做儿童工作比别的工作低一等。这就成了进一步开展少年儿童工作的阻力。因此就需要用宣传的方法，来改变这种旧社会轻视儿童教育的心理，争取更多的人来关心儿童，争取那些直接负责儿童教育工作的人，为培养祖国的新一代发出更大的光和热。可是如果只宣传了爱护与关心少年儿童的必要性，而没有向广大人民宣传爱护与教育少年儿童的正确方法，那我们的少年儿童工作还是做不好的。因为现在并不是所有人的教育观点、教育方法都是合乎马克思列宁主义的。那些封建的、资产阶级的观点和方法，还常常在儿童教育中起作用。
    正确的合乎马克思列宁主义的教育方法是从那里来的呢？是从培养教育少年儿童的方针而来的。我们的方针，就是要将今天的儿童培养成为社会主义优秀的建设者。在社会主义社会里，生产比现在大大地进步了，高度技术基础的大工业代替了技术落后的工业和手工业，拖拉机将要代替今天的锄头和旧式犁；在社会主义社会里，一切剥削人的现象将要消灭，生产资料的私有制也将为全民和集体所有制所代替，劳动成为光荣、豪迈和英勇的事业，集体的利益将高于一切；在社会主义社会里，人民的文化生活水平也将大大地提高，人民的思想、行为和感情将要变得空前高尚。因此，社会主义的建设者，必须是具有高度文化科学知识、共产主义道德品质、健壮体魄的新型人物。也就是说，我们应该把今天的少年儿童培养成为全面发展的、爱祖国、爱人民、爱劳动、爱科学、爱护公共财物、健壮、活泼、勇敢、诚实的新一代。
    方针有了，那么应该怎样来进行教育呢？我认为：
    首先要大力引导少年儿童好好学习，使他们逐步地牢固地掌握知识。知识就是力量。列宁说：
  “只有用人类创造出来的全部知识宝藏来丰富自己的头脑时，才能成为共产主义者。”所以我们在儿童时期，就应该给他们打下良好的知识基础，使他们在掌握知识过程中不断地发挥自己的才能，逐渐形成共产主义的世界观。学校就是对儿童进行共产主义教育的主要场所。少年先锋队就应该密切地配合学校来进行活动。并且要善于用各种各样的方法来诱导少年儿童热爱学习。过去任弼时同志给他孩子写的话很好：“小孩子要用心读书，现在不学将来没用。”要让儿童懂得：将来要建设祖国，今天就要用心学习，掌握知识。
    要经常注意启发少年儿童爱祖国、爱人民的热情，激发他们树立崇高的理想和志愿。爱国主义是推动我们国家发展的强大动力。它唤起我们的人民经常准备好自己的力量，来为祖国的建设事业进行卓越的斗争。斯大林说：伟大的力量乃是在为着伟大的目的中发出的。所以，以爱国主义教育儿童，是极为重要的事情。我们应该经常宣传祖国最可爱，宣传那些保卫祖国和为了祖国勇敢、勤奋而忘我地劳动的人们最可爱。使儿童为了建设共产主义而努力学习。使少年儿童懂得要为国家、为人民办事情，而不是自私自利为个人打算，这样才能牢固地树立起他们崇高的理想。
    要认真地注意培养少年儿童热爱劳动，使他们逐渐养成良好的劳动习惯。劳动教育是我们对少年儿童进行共产主义教育的根本内容之一。共产主义的胜利也就是劳动的胜利。到社会主义、共产主义社会就是大家劳动大家享受。加里宁说得很好：“不仅要爱好劳动，而且要诚实地看待劳动，应牢牢地记住：如果一个人活着，只吃饭不做事，那他就是侵蚀别人的劳动。”听说，有的少年儿童参观了工厂以后说，我长大了不当工人，因为工厂的活太重太脏。这说明我们的教育还存在问题。还不能使儿童懂得一切美好的事物都是劳动创造出来的。只有劳动才能使国家工业化、才能使人民有最幸福的生活。不爱劳动就不可能成为一个对国家有用、对人民有益的人，岂不是很明白的吗？但是，培养少年儿童热爱劳动，并不是把儿童当劳动力来使用。任何让少年儿童担负成人劳动的做法都是错误的，因为这是他们力不能及的，有害其健康的。因此我们应该用适合儿童特点并为他们体力所胜任的各种方法——如培植花木，制作模型，采集标本，和工人农民联欢等，来培养少年儿童的劳动习惯。
    多方面提倡儿童的体育运动。这是使少年儿童具有健壮身体的重要方法。儿童时期是长知识长身体的时期。因此，长身体也应成为儿童的任务之一，我们应该提倡用多种多样方法，培养儿童有健壮的身体。但是，现在有些地方，对儿童的体育限制过严。例如不许游泳、不许翻杠子等等。如果我们又要提倡体育又不许擦破一点皮，我想这是很难办到的。问题是在于我们能否正确指导少年儿童的体育活动，而不是简单地禁止。只有不断地锻炼，才能培养出健壮的身体，也才能培养出勇敢的性格。如果不这样做，反而要儿童“斯文规矩”、“老实听话”、“看戏不准笑，走路不要跳”，那不是把少年儿童变成了弱不经风的、胆怯的不勇敢的人吗？他们长大了如何能担当得起建设祖国和保卫祖国的重大任务呢？
    要培养少年儿童对文学艺术的爱好和兴趣。文学艺术能够提高少年儿童的智慧，使他们懂得欣赏美好的事物。文学和艺术更能帮助儿童认识现实的生活，帮助培养他们的优美的感情和坚强的意志，培养他们的理想和创造的能力，鼓舞他们热烈追求新事物新生活。因此要发展少年儿童对文学、音乐、图画、诗歌等等的兴趣。
    对儿童进行教育时，应当掌握两个原则：第一是要坚持长期正面的教育，这是培养少年儿童的根本方法。少年儿童很年轻，很纯洁，他们体力很弱，知识很贫乏，辨别是非的能力很差。因此，我们就要耐心地、长期地进行正面的教育，用正面的东西去引导他们前进。而绝对不能采取打击、惩罚、斗争等粗暴的方法。有些人对儿童也采取了对旧知识分子的政策，去对他们进行争取、团结、改造，少年儿童有什么需要改造的呢？这种做法是完全错误的。第二是要善于发挥少年儿童的独立性、主动性和积极性。独立性和积极性，这是一种好的品质，它使人们一生中不盲从，不依赖，在任何困苦情况下，都是乐观的向上的，勇敢地去和困难作斗争。建立少年儿童自己的组织——少年先锋队是发挥他们独立性、主动性和积极性的好办法。少年儿童在自己的组织里，可以逐步习惯于集体生活，学会自己管理自己，发挥自己的独立能力与积极性和主动性。
    培养教育儿童，是国家建设事业的一部分，也是党的整个事业的一部分。党和人民把这样一个重任交给了教师和儿童工作者，这是党和人民对他们的高度信赖，是教师和儿童工作者的莫大光荣。要把培养教育儿童的事业做好，首先要依靠儿童教育工作者坚持不懈的努力，依靠儿童教育工作者高度的政治热情和责任心，依靠儿童教育工作者不断地提高自己在思想作风、政治和文化等方面的修养，使自己在各方面都成为儿童的表率。儿童时期是一个人成长过程中最易受影响的时期，因此，教师和儿童工作者不但要善于用革命领袖的、伟人的、英雄和劳动模范的斗争事迹去教育儿童，而且要以自己的模范行为去影响儿童，在儿童中树立榜样。只有这样，我们才能出色地完成党和人民所委托的光荣任务，才能培养出有高尚品质的优秀的新中国建设者。
    在儿童教育战线上，目前我们已经有一百五十多万教师，十六万个少先队的辅导员，一千多个专门做少年儿童工作的干部。这些同志，绝大多数工作是努力的，有成绩的。其中有许多同志还做得很出色。过去许多教师曾受到了党和政府的表扬，在这次的会议上，我们也要用团中央和第二次全国少年儿童工作会议的名义，来奖励八十三位优秀的辅导员，感谢他们出色地培养着国家和人民的未来与希望——今天的儿童。
    这些同志工作所以作的好，就是因为他们热爱党和人民交给自己的工作，热爱儿童，他们把自己的心血贯注在工作中，像一个优秀的园艺家爱护花木那样地培植着新一代，同时他们还有最大的勇气和决心。有了决心就会钻进去，想出各种培养教育的办法来。一件事情的成功与否，除了要符合客观发展的规律外，就要看他是否有足够的决心了。培养教育儿童是一种新的工作，必然会遇到种种困难。但是，在决心为人民事业奋斗的人们面前，在决心为党和人民培养出新型人物的人们面前，任何困难都是吓不倒他，也阻止不住他前进的。我们的优秀教师、优秀辅导员在这方面就做出了很好的榜样，他们那种忠心耿耿，埋头苦干地为人民、为孩子服务的高贵品质是值得学习的，他们的经验是值得推广的。
    同志们，我国九岁到十五岁的孩子约有七八千万，要把这一代培养好，是一个艰巨和光荣的事业。我相信，在党和毛主席的亲切关怀与领导下，在各方面积极支持与帮助下，经过大家的共同努力，少年儿童工作将会获得更大的成绩。
