Construct Cities According to the Principles of Economy, Applicability, and Aesthetics
Lan Tian
With the development of national industrial construction and the gradual improvement of people's lives, our country is now focusing on building new cities and expanding and rebuilding some old cities. When carrying out the construction, expansion, and renovation of these cities, we must consider what kind of cities to build based on the country's long-term construction plan, industrial layout, and the different nature, natural conditions, and economic and technical conditions of each city. We must formulate a scientifically based overall urban plan, including the city's development scale, regional division, location of the city center and squares, the layout of transportation and urban greening, as well as design that determines the city's appearance and architectural art forms. With such an overall plan, we can carry out construction in a planned way and avoid causing difficulties for future urban life and reconstruction. Under normal circumstances, the overall urban plan must precede the requirements of basic construction, so strengthening leadership in urban construction and strengthening urban planning and design has become a very important and urgent task for us at present.

Our urban construction today is not only to meet current needs, but also to lay the foundation for a better future. There is no doubt that our cities cannot develop anarchically and chaotically like capitalist cities, but should adhere to the socialist urban construction policy and adhere to the principles of economy, applicability, and aesthetics.

I. Building Economical and Rational Cities

Building economical and rational cities is one of the important principles we should follow in urban construction. Specifically, it means: First, we must rely on the foundation of old cities to transform and develop with emphasis and in stages, from near to far, from inside to outside. Without affecting the special requirements of enterprises and the health of residents, we should pay attention to the compactness of urban layout and avoid decentralization in construction. Some cities, when planning urban development, do not mainly rely on the foundation of old cities to gradually rebuild and develop. Instead, they proceed from subjective wishes, lack economic basis and research on the city's natural conditions, overestimate the population growth, blindly expand the urban area, and engage in "big city" plans with a population of more than one million and an area of hundreds of square kilometers, making the urban area too wide. Some cities, when formulating urban plans, are only enthusiastic about the long-term development plan of the city, while neglecting the recent development plan. Instead of developing gradually from near to far and from inside to outside, they often carry out construction comprehensively on all the land planned for long-term development, dispersing construction land, resulting in many isolated buildings and open spaces in the city, and the phenomenon of scattered residential, industrial, and transportation land, which increases the length of roads, water supply, and sewer pipes, and greatly increases the cost of urban construction. The result is either that urban public utilities cannot keep up with the needs of the construction industry, or that construction units build their own water supply, roads, and sewers, resulting in huge waste. Moreover, because the urban area is expanded too quickly and unnecessarily, a large amount of farmland is requisitioned, which also affects the lives of farmers and the difficulty of resettling transferred personnel. Of course, in correcting these deviations, we should also pay attention to reserving necessary isolation zones according to the special requirements and safety conditions of different factories and the degree of harm that affects the health of residents; we should reserve appropriate land for enterprises that are preparing to expand in the future; and we should correctly grasp the urban population density to avoid congestion.

Second, we must pay attention to the integrity of urban development and use land rationally. The characteristics of a city are concentration and modern sanitary and welfare facilities. Therefore, when each enterprise carries out construction, it should consider the connection between each other and avoid each residential area building separate water supply, sewer, and heating equipment; at the same time, common buildings (such as auditoriums, canteens, heating and cultural and entertainment equipment, etc.) should be placed together as much as possible to avoid each doing their own thing. This can save the country's construction costs and maintain the necessary integrity of the urban structure. Some departments often carry out large-scale construction far away from the city, and a large area of open space is separated between the construction area and the city, forming an isolated construction area, which is very inconvenient to connect with the city, which not only wastes land and construction costs, but also damages the integrity of urban development.

In order to make cities use land rationally, in addition to the urban construction department studying and formulating urban land use methods and carrying out necessary management, what is especially important is that construction units must proceed from reality, rationally calculate enterprise land use according to the needs of enterprise construction, prevent decentralization and departmentalism that disregard the overall development of the city, oppose the indiscriminate demand for land, and even the practice of arbitrarily requisitioning land and carrying out construction without government approval.

Third, we should appropriately increase the number of floors of buildings in different cities and different sections to reduce the cost of urban construction. In the Soviet Union, there are different requirements for the number of floors of buildings according to the size of the city. Today, limited by economic and technical conditions, we cannot demand too much for the number of floors of urban buildings. But according to the current situation, it is undoubtedly uneconomical to build a large number of bungalows in large cities. Because it not only wastes land, but also extends roads, sewers, and various pipelines, and increases the state's investment in public utilities construction. Last year, some large cities built many bungalows, some of which cost only 5 million yuan per room (calculated at 15 square meters), while the investment in sewers and roads was about 2 million yuan. The public utilities equipment of a one-story house is often several times more expensive than that of a high-rise house. Some people only think that building bungalows saves money, but from the perspective of the country as a whole, adding the investment in sewers and roads is actually a waste. Of course, it is not advisable to build a large number of bungalows in large cities, but it does not mean that all buildings should be high-rise buildings, but should be different requirements in different sections. For example, in the city center, around the square, on the main streets and riverbanks that need to be decorated, the number of floors of buildings should be appropriately controlled; while in the suburbs far from the city center and without public utilities equipment, bungalows can still be built. This not only saves money economically, but also increases the artistic effect of buildings in the city.

Finally, and most importantly, the development of modern cities is based on the development of industry. Our urban construction must be subject to the requirements of industry and build cities around the requirements of industrial construction. Of course, there are also cities built with culture and education or recuperation as the center, but the cities of culture, education, and recuperation are also developed around the requirements of industrial development. Therefore, whether we are rebuilding old cities or building new cities, we must focus on considering the scale of urban development based on the country's industrial layout, and first rebuild and build important industrial cities with emphasis and in stages to ensure the needs of industrial construction and the lives of working people. As for general cities that do not have modern industry or have a small proportion of industrial construction, we should implement the country's policy of key construction and temporarily maintain the status quo. Only when the country first concentrates its efforts to do a good job in important industrial cities can it be possible to build other cities well. Moreover, even in the cities that are the focus of construction, the construction projects should also be carried out with emphasis under the necessary and possible conditions, and resolutely avoid the practice of greed and dispersion.

II. Fully Care for the Material and Cultural Needs of the Working People

Another principle of urban construction is applicability. That is, on the one hand, to ensure favorable development conditions for production; on the other hand, to gradually meet the growing material and cultural needs of the working people and create comfortable and beautiful living conditions for the working people, such as good workplaces, healthy and hygienic living environments, and convenient rest and enjoyment of cultural life, etc.

Whether the reconstruction and new construction of cities are reasonable and whether they are suitable for the development of production and the living needs of the working people are first reflected in the zoning of the city: how to correctly arrange industrial areas, residential areas, cultural and educational areas, and transportation, how to arrange administrative areas, social activity center squares, and arterial road systems, how to consider the wind direction, so that residential areas are not affected by the noise, smoke, harmful gases, and dust of factories, etc. This is an extremely complex issue. The rulers of the old society never considered the living conditions of the people, and often built factories in residential or cultural and educational areas. Some of our construction units have also made this mistake in construction because they do not understand the meaning of urban zoning. For example, a tannery in a city was originally built in the cultural and educational area. The Municipal People's Government suggested relocating it, but the construction unit did not respect the opinion of the Municipal People's Government and rashly expanded it in situ, resulting in a large amount of sewage that could not be discharged and changed the quality of the nearby groundwater, which seriously affected the drinking water of local residents. Some cities have arranged industrial areas in windy places and upstream of rivers, affecting the health of urban residents; some units have built houses in industrial areas, so that workers are often exposed to machine noise and smoke; some places have built hospitals and schools near factories, affecting the recuperation of patients and the learning of students. The above are all inconsistent with the principles of rational zoning and the principles of hygiene. The correct approach is that factories that are directly related to the lives of residents or are harmless and hygienic can be built in residential areas, and factories that are harmful and hygienic and dangerous should be built on the periphery of the city. Generally, factories should be built downwind of the main wind direction and downstream of rivers. A certain distance of sanitary protection zone should be set up between the factory and the residential area according to the nature of the factory. Areas with better sanitary conditions and beautiful scenery should be used as residential and rest areas for the working people as much as possible.

Secondly, when designing and building houses, we should pay close attention to the actual needs of the working people's lives. When building larger residential areas, not only building houses, but also the welfare facilities of workers, such as shops, cooperatives, nurseries, clinics, schools, and necessary sanitary and cultural and entertainment equipment, etc., should be considered and solved as a whole as much as possible. The design of the house should also be scientific and reasonable under certain economic conditions, and should make the working people live as comfortably and conveniently as possible. Building suitable houses does not mean luxury and waste, but the key lies in whether it has the greatest concern for the working people. With the same amount of money, houses can be designed and arranged better.

III. Must Reflect the Greatness and Beauty of the New Era

Urban buildings should not only be economical and practical, but also be built beautifully. The resolution of the Central Committee of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) and the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union in 1935 on the overall plan for the reconstruction of Moscow emphasized that the task of the Moscow Party organization and the Soviet organs is not only to formally complete the plan for the reconstruction of Moscow, but first of all to build beautiful buildings for the working people, and to make the construction and architectural forms of the Soviet capital fully reflect the greatness and beauty of the socialist era. These principles are also of great guiding significance for our urban construction today.

The aesthetics we require at present lies first in the design of the overall layout of the city and the construction of houses, which should not only reflect the superiority of our social system and reflect the greatness and beauty of the new era; but also, on the basis of studying and criticizing all the excellent achievements of classical architecture and modern architecture, create a higher, progressive architectural art that combines the characteristics of the new China and socialist content.

The issue of architectural art in urban construction is a new issue worthy of attention. Because we have not accumulated enough experience in this regard, some construction units only require building houses, and rarely consider how to build and what kind of houses to build; coupled with the fact that there are still many bourgeois views and some restoration views in our design work, we often copy the architectural forms of capitalist countries and mechanically imitate the old architectural forms of our feudal era. Therefore, in addition to the design and layout of individual buildings being better in the past few years, many barrack-style (row-style), box-style, and strange-shaped houses have appeared in many cities. Some new workers' villages are barrack-style, with many rows, all the same, and it is difficult for workers to find their own houses when they go home. Some residential, hospital, and school heating equipment have built tall chimneys like factories, which are neither economical nor beautiful. Obviously, these buildings can only leave unpleasant impressions.

Secondly, the beauty of the city is also reflected in whether the arrangement of buildings is appropriate. Each unit that carries out construction in the city should abide by the local city's regulations on building land, style, and number of floors, so that the basic style of each building is coordinated with the entire city and the entire region. Especially the buildings in the city center, main roads, and around the square should be controlled. In these important sections, special buildings that can reflect the greatness and beauty of the new era should be built. If it is not possible to do this completely due to current technical and economic conditions, the possibility of beautifying and modifying it in the future should also be considered when building, so as not to become an obstacle to future large-scale construction; or simply leave good sections for future construction of good buildings. Many new buildings in existing cities do not pay attention to the beauty of the city, and put high-rise buildings and better public buildings in small alleys, while the old and low-rise buildings still remain on the streets, or hide tall buildings inside, while building walls and small houses facing the street, which is very uncoordinated. Rossi, a famous Soviet architect, said: "The beauty of a city does not lie in the number of good buildings, but in the appropriate location of a few good buildings, which can beautify the city."

Art and economy in architecture should be understood in a unified way, that is to say, it should be both economical and beautiful. For a few commemorative and important buildings, it is possible to spend more money for necessary decoration, but for general buildings, it should be beautiful within the established investment amount, pay attention to artistic layout, and design better.

The above-mentioned principles of economy, applicability, and aesthetics are the basic principles that we should follow in rebuilding old cities and building new cities. At present, in the specific work of urban construction, special attention should be paid to the issue of applicability under the principle of economy and aesthetics. The layout and design of each building should fully reflect the infinite care for the lives of the working people, and strive to be scientific and reasonable, and create good workplaces and hygienic, convenient, comfortable, and healthy living conditions for the working people.

    按照经济、适用、美观的原则建设城市
    蓝田
    随着国家工业建设的开展和人民生活的逐步改善，我国现在正在有重点地建设新的城市，和对一部分旧的城市进行扩建和改建。在进行这些城市的新建、扩建和改建时，我们必须根据国家的长远建设计划，工业布局，及分别不同城市的性质，不同的自然条件和经济技术条件，来考虑建设什么样的城市；必须拟订有科学根据的城市总体规划，包括城市的发展规模，区域的划分，城市中心及广场的位置，交通运输及城市绿化的布置，以及决定城市的外貌和建筑艺术形式的设计等等。有了这样的总体规划，我们便能够有计划地进行建设，避免造成今后城市生活和改建的困难。而按照正常状况，城市的总体规划又必须先走一步，才能适应基本建设的要求，所以，加强对城市建设的领导，加强城市的规划设计，已成为我们目前一项十分重要而迫切的任务。
    我们今天的城市建设，不仅是为了满足现在的需要，同时也要为美好的将来打下基础。毫无疑问，我们的城市不能像资本主义城市那样无政府地杂乱无章地发展，而应当坚持社会主义城市建设的方针，坚持经济、适用、美观的原则。
    一、建设经济而合理的城市
    建设经济而合理的城市是我们在城市建设中应该遵循的重要原则之一。具体地说，就是：首先要依托旧城市的基础，有重点有步骤地改造与发展，由近及远，由内到外，在不影响企业的特殊要求及居民健康的条件下，注意城市布局的紧凑性，避免建设中的分散主义。现在有些城市在规划城市发展时，不是主要地依靠旧城市的基础，逐步改建与发展，而多从主观愿望出发，缺乏经济根据和对于本市自然条件的勘察研究，过高估计人口的增长数目，盲目扩大市区，动辄以发展百万以上人口及数百平方公里面积，搞“大城市”计划，把市区拉得太宽太广。有的城市在拟定城市规划时，只热心于城市发展的远景计划，而忽略最近时期的发展计划，不是由近而远，由内而外，逐步地发展，而往往是在计划长远发展用的全部土地上全面进行，分散建筑用地，结果使得城市中出现了许多孤立的建筑物和空地，使得居住、工业、运输用地产生零散现象，增长了道路、自来水、下水道等管线的长度，大大增加了城市建设的造价。其结果不是城市公用事业赶不上建设事业的需要，就是建设单位自建自来水、道路、下水道、造成巨大浪费。而且因为过快地不必要地扩大市区面积，大量征购农民的土地，也影响农民生活及安置转业的困难。当然，在纠正这些偏向时，我们也应该注意根据不同工厂的特殊要求，安全条件及影响居民健康的有害程度，保留必要的隔离地带；应该对将来准备扩充的企业保留适当用地；并正确地掌握城市人口密度，避免拥挤。
    其次，要注意城市发展的整体性，合理使用土地。城市的特点是集中的，卫生福利设施是现代化的。因此，各个企业在进行建设时，应考虑彼此间的联系，避免每个住宅区各自修建单独的自来水、下水道及取暖等设备；同时要使共同性的建筑（如礼堂、食堂、暖气及文化娱乐设备等）尽量放在一起，避免各搞一套。这样既可以节省国家的建设费用，也使城市结构保持必要的完整性。现在有些部门往往在距离城市很远的地方进行大规模建筑，而建筑地区与城市之间间隔着一大片空地，形成一个孤立的建筑区，与城市联系很不方便，不仅在土地使用及建设费用上造成浪费，并且损害了城市发展的整体性。
    为使城市合理使用土地，除城市建设部门应研究制定城市土地使用办法，加以必要的管理外，尤其重要的是建设单位必须从实际出发，依据企业建设的需要，合理地计算企业用地，防止不顾城市整体发展的分散主义和本位主义，反对滥要土地，甚至不经过政府批准就随便征购土地、随意进行建筑的做法。
    再次，要分别不同城市和不同地段，适当增高房屋建筑层数，以减少城市建设的造价。在苏联，按照城市的大小，对房屋建筑层数有不同的要求。我们今天限于经济条件及技术条件，对于城市房屋建筑层数还不能要求过高。但根据现在情况，在大城市里大量修建平房无疑是不合算的。因为它不仅浪费土地，而且延长了道路、上下水道及各种管线，增大了国家对公用事业建设的投资。去年有一些大城市修建了许多平房，有的房子造价每间（按十五平方公尺计算）仅五百万元，而上下水道、道路的投资约需二百万元。一层房屋的公用事业设备常常要比高层房屋贵好几倍。有些人只看修建平房省钱，可是从国家整体来说，加上上下水道及道路等的投资，其实反是浪费。当然，在大城市里不宜大量修建平房，并不是说一律要修建高层建筑，而是应该区别不同地段，有不同的要求。如在城市的中心、广场周围、主要街道及需要装饰和点缀的河岸等地方，对房屋建筑层数就应有适当控制；而在距市中心较远又不建设公用事业设备的郊区，还可修建平房。这样做不仅在经济上节省，而且增加城市中建筑艺术的效果。
    最后，也是最重要的，就是近代的城市发展，是依靠工业的发展而发展起来的。我们的城市建设必须服从工业上的要求，围绕着工业建设的要求来建设城市。当然，也有以文化教育或休养为中心而建设的城市，但文化教育及休养的城市也是围绕着工业发展的要求而发展起来的。所以，我们无论在改建旧城市或建设新城市时，必须着重依据国家的工业布局来考虑城市的发展规模，首先有重点有步骤地对重要工业城市进行改建和新建，以保证工业建设及劳动人民生活的需要。至于没有近代化工业或工业建设比重小的一般城市，应贯彻国家重点建设的方针，暂时维持现状。只有国家首先集中力量把重要工业城市搞好之后，才有可能把其它城市建设好。而且，即使是重点建设的城市，在建设工程上亦应在必需与可能的条件下有重点地进行，切实避免贪多分散的做法。
    二、充分地关怀劳动人民物质和文化生活的需要
    城市建设的另一个原则是适用。即一方面要保证生产的有利发展条件；另一方面要逐步地满足劳动人民日益增长的物质和文化生活的需要，为劳动人民创造舒适美好的生活条件，如好的劳动场所，有利于健康的卫生的居住环境，便于休息及享受文化生活等等。
    城市的改建和新建是否合理，是否适合于发展生产及劳动人民的生活需要，首先表现在城市的区划上面：如何正确布置工业区、住宅区、文化教育区与交通运输，如何布置行政区、社会活动中心广场及干道系统，如何考虑风向问题，使住宅区不致受工厂的喧嚣声、煤烟、有害气体和灰尘的影响等等。这是一个极复杂的问题。旧社会的统治者从来不考虑人民的生活条件，往往把工厂建设在住宅区或文教区里。我们有些建设单位因为不懂城市区划的意义，在建设中也曾犯过这种错误。如有一个城市的制革厂原建设在文教区内，市人民政府曾建议迁建，但建设单位没有尊重市人民政府的意见，冒然就地扩建，结果大量污水排不出去，改变了附近地下水质，严重地影响了当地居民的吃水。有的城市把工业区布置在当风的地方和河流的上游，影响了城市居民的健康；也有的单位把住宅修建在工业区里，使工人经常受到机器的喧嚣及煤烟的侵袭；有的地方则把医院、学校建筑在工厂附近，影响了病员的疗养及学生的学习。以上这些都是不符合于合理的区划原则，不符合于卫生原则的。正确的做法是，与居民生活直接有关的或无害卫生的工厂，可以建在居住区内，有害卫生的及有危险性的工厂则应建在城市外围。一般工厂应建在主要风向的下风和河流的下游。工厂与住宅区之间要按工厂的性质设置一定距离的卫生防护地带。卫生条件较好及风景优美的地区，应尽可能作为劳动人民的居住区和休息区。
    其次，在设计和建筑房屋时，应密切注意劳动人民生活的实际需要。在建设较大的住宅区时，不仅是建筑房屋，还要把工人的福利设施，如商店、合作社、托儿所、诊疗所、学校及必需的卫生和文化娱乐设备等等，尽可能地联系在一起作总体的考虑与解决。房屋的设计也要在一定的经济条件下力求科学合理，尽可能使劳动人民居住得舒适方便。修建适用的房屋，并不意味着奢侈浪费，而关键在于是否具有对劳动人民的最大关怀。用同样多的钱，可以把房子设计与布置得更好一些。
    三、必须反映新时代的伟大和美丽
    城市建筑不仅要经济适用，还要修得美观。联共（布）中央和苏联人民委员会一九三五年关于改建莫斯科市的总计划的决议中强调指出：莫斯科的党组织与苏维埃机关的任务不仅在于形式地完成改建莫斯科的计划，而首先要为劳动人民建筑美好的建筑物，并使苏联首都的建设和建筑形式能充分地表现出社会主义时代的伟大和美丽。这些原则，对我们今天的城市建设也具有重大的指导意义。
    目前我们所要求的美观，首先在于设计城市总平面布置及房屋建筑方面，既要表现我们社会制度的优越性，反映新时代的伟大和美丽；又要在研究批判古典建筑及近代建筑一切优良成就的基础上，创造出更高的、进步的具有新中国特点的形式和社会主义内容相结合的建筑艺术。
    城市建设中的建筑艺术问题是一个新的值得注意的问题。由于我们对此还没有积累起足够的经验，一些建设单位只要求造房子，至于如何造，造什么样的房子，则很少考虑；加上我们设计工作中还存在着不少资产阶级观点和一些复古观点，往往抄袭资本主义国家的建筑形式和机械地模仿我国封建时代旧的建筑形式，因而几年来除了个别建筑的设计及布置较好外，在不少城市中却出现了许多兵营式的（行列式的）、盒子式的及奇形怪状的房子。有些工人新村都是兵营式的，行列很多，千篇一律，工人回家都很难找到自己的房子。还有些住宅、医院、学校建设取暖设备时，修建了像工厂一样高大的烟筒，既不经济又不美观。显然，这些建筑只能给人留下不愉快的印象。
    其次，城市美观还表现在建筑物的布置是否恰当。在城市内进行建筑的每个单位，应遵守当地城市关于建筑地段、样式、层数的规定，使每一所建筑物的基本样式和整个城市及整个地区相协调。尤其是在城市中心、主要干道及广场周围的建筑，更应加以控制。在这些重要地段上，特别要修建能反映新时代的伟大和美丽的建筑物。如果限于当前的技术条件和经济条件，还不可能完全做到这样，在修建时也应考虑将来有加工美化和改修的可能，不要使它成为将来大建设时的障碍；或者干脆留出好的地段，作为将来修建好的建筑物之用。现有城市中很多新的建筑物，不注意城市美观问题，把高层的房屋建筑及较好的公共建筑物摆在小胡同里，而大街上仍残留着破旧的低层的建筑物，或者把高大楼房藏在里面，而临街却修建围墙和小房子，很不协调。苏联有名的建筑师罗西说：“城市的美观不在好建筑物的多少，而在于少数好的建筑物位置摆得适当，就可以把城市美化起来。”
    在建筑上艺术与经济应作统一的了解，即是说，应当是既经济又美观。对少数有纪念性的和重要的建筑物加以必要的装饰，可以多花一些钱，对一般建筑物，却应当在已定的投资数额内做到美观，注意艺术布局，设计得更好些。
    上述经济、适用、美观的原则，是我们在改建旧城市和建设新城市中应当遵循的基本原则。目前在城市建设的具体工作中，尤应在经济兼顾美观的原则下特别注意适用问题。要使每座建筑物的布置和设计，充分地体现对于劳动人民生活的无限关怀，力求科学合理，为劳动人民创造良好的劳动场所和卫生、方便、舒适、有利于健康的生活条件。
