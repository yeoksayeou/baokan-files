Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, January 30th: The Standing Committee of the Japan Peace Preservation Committee held its first meeting of 1954 in Tokyo on January 18th. The meeting defined the direction of the Japanese peace movement and decided to hold a "Japan Conference of People Who Love World Peace" in major cities across the country from April 1st to April 22nd.

　　The meeting passed a policy of opposing rearmament and defending the Constitution, which pointed out that the rearmament carried out by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries will deepen international tensions and expand the war crisis. Therefore, opposing rearmament is the central task of the Japanese peace movement at this stage, and the Japanese people must do everything in their power to accomplish this task. While launching the movement against rearmament and to defend the Constitution, it is also necessary to launch movements to demand the restoration of diplomatic relations between Japan and China and the Soviet Union, promote friendly relations and trade between countries, demand a five-power conference, and implement disarmament and a ban on the use of atomic weapons.

　　In order to further promote the Japanese people's movement against rearmament, the meeting decided to connect it with the painful lives of the broad masses, conduct in-depth propaganda among them, and encourage members of the Diet to oppose rearmament and oppose amending the Constitution.

　　The meeting also passed a policy of opposing the U.S. Mutual Security Agency's "aid" movement, pointing out that the U.S. Mutual Security Agency's "aid" is a constraint that forces Japanese youth to serve as American mercenaries and a shackle that militarizes Japan and subjects it to trade restrictions. Therefore, it is necessary to cooperate with various groups in various places to jointly launch a struggle.

　　In order to welcome the international conference on easing tensions that is being prepared, the Standing Committee of the Japan Peace Preservation Committee decided to launch a movement across the country to promote this international conference. To this end, it is necessary to widely publicize the appeals and resolutions of the World Peace Council and establish a liaison office to conduct international liaison.

　　The meeting also decided to hold a "Japan Conference of People Who Love World Peace" in Tokyo, Nagasaki, Kumamoto, Hiroshima, Kobe, Kyoto, Nagoya, Sendai, and other places from April 1st to 22nd to discuss issues such as banning the use of atomic weapons, resolving international disputes through consultation, and defending the Japanese Peace Constitution.

　　日本拥护和平委员会常委会举行会议
　　确定现阶段日本和平运动的中心任务是反对重整军备
    【新华社三十日讯】东京消息：一月十八日，日本拥护和平委员会常务委员会在东京召开一九五四年度第一次会议，确定了日本和平运动的方针，并决定自四月一日到四月二十二日在全国各大城市巡回举行“日本爱好世界和平者会议”。
    会议通过了反对重整军备，保卫宪法运动的方针，其中指出：美日反动派进行的重整军备，将会加深国际紧张局势，扩大战争危机。因此，反对重整军备是日本和平运动现阶段的中心任务，日本人民必须竭尽全力来完成这个任务。在展开反对重整军备、保卫宪法运动的同时，还要展开要求恢复日本和中国、苏联的邦交，促进各国间友好关系和贸易，要求举行五大国会议，实行裁军和禁止使用原子武器等运动。
    为了进一步推进日本人民反对重整军备的运动，会议决定要联系广大群众的痛苦生活，向他们进行深入的宣传，并推动国会议员反对重整军备和反对修改宪法。
    会议并通过了反对美国共同安全署“援助”运动的方针，指出美国共同安全署“援助”是迫使日本青年充当美国雇佣兵的一种约束，是使日本军国主义化和遭受贸易限制的一种束缚。因此，要在各地与各种团体合作，共同展开斗争。
    为了迎接准备召开的缓和紧张局势的国际会议，日本拥护和平委员会常务委员会决定要在全国展开促进这个国际会议的运动。为此，要广泛宣传世界和平理事会的号召和决议，并设立一个联络事务局进行国际间的联系。
    会议并决定要从四月一日到二十二日，在东京、长崎、熊本、广岛、神户、京都、名古屋、仙台等地巡回举行“日本爱好世界和平者会议”，讨论禁止使用原子武器、以协商方式解决国际争端和保卫日本和平宪法等问题。
