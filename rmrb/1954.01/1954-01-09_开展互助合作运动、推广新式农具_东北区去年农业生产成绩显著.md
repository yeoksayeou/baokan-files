Launching a Movement of Mutual Assistance and Cooperation, Promoting New Farm Tools
Significant Achievements in Agricultural Production in the Northeast Region Last Year
    In the first year of the country's First Five-Year Plan, Northeast China achieved great success in agricultural production. Although various crops in Southern and Northern Manchuria suffered from many natural disasters last year, the region's total harvest still exceeded the actual output of 1950 (a bumper year) and 1951 (when the disaster was less severe than in 1953); the average yield per hectare was 1,245 kilograms. Due to the reduction in planting area, the total cotton output was less than in 1952, but the yield per hectare reached 693 kilograms, exceeding 1952 by 16 kilograms.
    Under the leadership of Party committees and governments at all levels, the peasants in the region actively developed the movement of mutual assistance and cooperation, and the socialist factors in the agricultural economy continued to grow, playing a significant role in overcoming disasters and ensuring grain harvests. Agricultural production cooperatives generally harvested more grain and increased their income compared to ordinary mutual aid teams and individual farmers. The socialist state-owned farms also initially demonstrated the superiority of the socialist economy. The region now has 20 experimental farms, 160 demonstration breeding farms, 190 general production farms, and 24 mechanized farms. The mechanized farms alone produced 90,000 tons of grain for the state, all of which was handed over to the state after deducting wages and other expenses. The grain turned over to the state by the Panshan Farm alone was equivalent to the amount of grain sold by farmers in 100 villages in Northern Manchuria.
    On the basis of developing the movement of mutual assistance and cooperation, the region launched an unprecedented mass technical reform movement in 1953, focusing on promoting the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience. Crops planted in various places using the Zhaoyuan high-yield experience generally had 10% to 20% more plants per hectare than in previous years, resulting in an estimated increase in grain production of about 1 million tons for the region. At the same time, high-yield fields were cultivated in various places, covering about 1.5 million hectares. The crops in these high-yield fields could, on average, yield 20% to 30% more than ordinary fields in the area, and some crops yielded one to two times more.
    With the rapid development of the national industry, industrial departments manufactured a large number of farm tools, pesticides, and chemical fertilizers, providing agriculture with increasing assistance, which further promoted the increase in grain production. In 1952, the region promoted 600 sets of new-style horse-drawn farm tools, with each set cultivating an average of 13 hectares of land. In 1953, this rapidly increased to 4,600 sets, with each set cultivating an average of 17 hectares of land. The use of new farm tools for deep plowing, fine harrowing, and flat, dense planting increased wheat yield by about 1,000 jin per hectare, and field crops also increased significantly. In 1953, the region supplied farmers with 76,000 tons of ammonium sulfate, an increase of 26,000 tons over 1952. At the same time, 2,400 tons of superphosphate of lime were supplied, and the supply of soybean rhizobium inoculant more than doubled compared to 1952. Its promotion and use covered 1.5 million hectares of land, and the yield increased by 5% to 10% compared to ordinary land. Due to the increased production of seed disinfectants, the area of seed disinfection for various crops in the region increased significantly. The area of wheat seed disinfection reached 40%, an increase of 11% over 1952, and the area of millet disinfection reached 27%, also an increase over 1952. Seed disinfection greatly reduced smut disease and increased yields. In order to meet the needs of agricultural technology improvement, agricultural technology guidance stations have developed accordingly. In 1952, only 85 pilot stations were established in the region. In 1953, the number reached 903, and 28 semi-mechanized guidance stations were also piloted. In addition, six agricultural machinery stations were piloted, using tractors to cultivate land for farmers on their behalf. These agricultural technology guidance stations and agricultural machinery stations effectively helped farmers use tractors, new farm tools, and improve farming techniques, thereby increasing yields.
    Under the illumination of the national general line, agricultural production in the Northeast will develop more rapidly. In 1954, the region plans to produce 22.3 million tons of grain. The region will continue to promote 3,000 sets of new farm tools and large quantities of pesticides and chemical fertilizers; the movement of mutual assistance and cooperation in the region will also see significant development.

    开展互助合作运动、推广新式农具
    东北区去年农业生产成绩显著
    在国家第一个五年计划的第一年度，东北农业生产获得了很大的成就。去年虽然南、北满各种作物遭受了许多自然灾害，但全区收获仍超过了一九五零年（丰收年）和一九五一年（灾情比一九五三年轻）的实际产量；单位面积产量每垧平均为一千二百四十五公斤；棉花因为播种面积减少，总产量比一九五二年少，但单位面积产量每垧达到六百九十三公斤，超过一九五二年十六公斤。
    全区农民在各级党委和政府领导下，积极发展互助合作运动，农业经济中的社会主义因素不断增长，对战胜灾害保证粮食的收成有很大的作用。农业生产合作社普遍比一般互助组和单干农民多打了粮食，增加了收入。社会主义的国营农场，亦初步显示出社会主义经济的优越性。全区现有试验农场二十处，示范繁殖场一百六十处，一般生产农场一百九十处，机械农场二十四处。仅机械农场就为国家生产了九万吨粮食，除去支付工资等开销外，全部上缴国家。盘山农场一个场上缴给国家的粮食，即相当于北满一百个村农民的卖粮数。
    在发展互助合作运动的基础上，一九五三年全区展开了空前的群众性的技术改革运动，重点推广了肇源丰产经验。各地一般采用肇源丰产经验播种的作物，每垧株数都比往年增加一成到二成，全区因此约增产粮食一百万吨左右。同时各地普遍培植了丰产地一百五十万垧左右，丰产地的庄稼平均可比当地一般田地庄稼增产二三成，部分庄稼增产一两倍。
    随着国家工业的迅速发展，工业部门制造了大量的农具、农药和化学肥料，给予农业越来越多的援助，更促进了粮食产量的增加。一九五二年全区推广六百套新式马拉农具，平均每套耕种十三垧地，一九五三年迅速增加到四千六百套，每套平均耕种十七垧地。使用新农具深耕细耙，平播密植，每垧小麦比过去增产一千市斤左右，大田作物也显著增加。一九五三年全区供给农民的硫安已增加到七万六千吨，比一九五二年增加二万六千吨，同时供给了二千四百吨过磷酸石灰，大豆根瘤接种剂的供给，比一九五二年也增加一倍以上，它的推广使用面积达一百五十万垧地，产量均比一般地增加百分之五至十。由于种子消毒剂制造数量的增多，全区各种作物种子消毒面积大大增加。小麦种子消毒面积达百分之四十，比一九五二年增加百分之十一，谷子消毒面积达百分之二十七，也比一九五二年增加。种子消毒后大大减少了黑穗病，增加了产量。为了适应农业技术改进的需要，农业技术指导站相应地有了很大的发展。一九五二年全区仅试办了八十五个，一九五三年达到了九百零三个，并且试办了二十八个半机械化的指导站。另外试办了六个农业机器站，用拖拉机给农民代耕。这些农业技术指导站、农业机器站都有效地帮助农民使用了拖拉机、新式农具，改进了耕作技术，因而提高了产量。
    在国家总路线照耀下，东北农业生产将更加迅速地发展。一九五四年全区计划生产二千二百三十万吨粮食。全区将继续推广三千套新式农具和大量农药及化学肥料；全区互助合作运动也将有显著发展。
