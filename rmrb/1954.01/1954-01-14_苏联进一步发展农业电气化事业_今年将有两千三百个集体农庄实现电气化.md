Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 13th - In 1954, the Soviet Union will further develop agricultural electrification, and the scale of electrification will exceed that of previous years. According to the resolution of the Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union in September 1953, in 1954, the Soviet Union's national power system, industrial and public power grid will be combined with collective farms and machine tractor stations in order to supply power to agriculture. Preparations for power supply have begun in many union republics and states. This year, the Soviet Union will build approximately 1,000 rural power stations with a total generating capacity of 74,000 kilowatts. Many of these are large power stations, for example, the State Rural Power Station on the Stalin Canal in the Armenian Republic has a generating capacity of 5,000 kilowatts, and the Krasnoyarsk Power Station in Stalingrad State has a generating capacity of 1,390 kilowatts. From 1954, Soviet industry will supply rural power stations with complete sets of power equipment. Many rural power stations will adopt automated management. Along with the construction of rural power stations, the Soviet countryside will also erect 50,000 kilometers of high-voltage and low-voltage power lines, and establish more than 7,000 transformer substations. It is expected that another 2,300 collective farms in the Soviet Union will be electrified this year, and the electrification of machine tractor stations will be basically completed. Collective farms and machine tractor stations will receive tens of thousands of generators to mechanize the laborious labor of feeding livestock and field work, and to supply power to greenhouses, repair shops, sawmills, brick factories and other departments.

    苏联进一步发展农业电气化事业
    今年将有两千三百个集体农庄实现电气化
    【新华社莫斯科十三日电】一九五四年苏联将进一步发展农业电气化，电气化的规模将超过已往各年。根据苏联共产党中央委员会一九五三年九月全体会议的决议，一九五四年苏联国家的电力系统、工业和公共电力站网将和集体农庄及机器拖拉机站结合起来，以便为农业供应电力。准备供电的工作已在许多加盟共和国和州中开始。今年苏联将建成约一千个总发电能力为七万四千瓩的农村电力站。其中有许多都是大型的电力站，例如，亚美尼亚共和国斯大林运河上国家农村电力站的发电能力为五千瓩，斯大林格勒州克拉斯诺雅尔斯克电力站的发电能力为一千三百九十瓩。从一九五四年起，苏联工业将供给农村电力站以全套配备好的电力设备。许多农村电力站将采用自动化管理。和建设农村电力站同时，苏联农村还将架设五万公里高压和低压电线，并建立七千多个变压器变电所。预计今年苏联又将有两千三百个集体农庄电气化，机器拖拉机站的电气化工作将基本上完成。集体农庄和机器拖拉机站将得到几万部发电机，以便使饲畜和田间工作的费力劳动机械化，并向暖室、修理场、锯木场，造砖场等部门供应电力。
