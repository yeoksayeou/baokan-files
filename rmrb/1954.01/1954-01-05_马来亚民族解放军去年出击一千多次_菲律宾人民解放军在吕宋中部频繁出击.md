    菲律宾人民解放军在吕宋中部频繁出击
    【新华社三日讯】吉隆坡消息：据马来亚英国殖民当局发表的不完全数字，马来亚民族解放军在一九五三年一共出击了一千二百次。
    马来亚联合邦英国当局发言人二日再一次不安地说：马来亚民族解放军“在柔佛州和森美兰州的活动显著地增加了”。
    【新华社四日讯】马尼拉消息：活跃在吕宋岛中部的菲律宾人民解放军在一九五三年一年中频繁地出击，不断打击菲律宾傀儡军。
    菲律宾傀儡军当局三日发表的公报承认：菲律宾人民解放军一九五三年在吕宋岛中部和菲律宾傀儡军作战三百七十次。菲律宾傀儡军当局并发表了下列显然缩小了的数字：傀儡军在这三百七十次战斗中被击毙四十二人，被打伤八十一人。
