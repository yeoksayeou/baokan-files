Xinhua News Agency Report:

    The Yoshida government is openly demanding that the Japanese people "tighten their belts" for rearmament.

    According to Kyodo News, Yoshida, in a public speech, emphasized that the Japanese people must endure a life of material deprivation. He even said, "If the current government and the Liberal Party lose the trust of the people because of this, it is the people's responsibility."

    The Japanese public is increasingly aware that "tightening their belts" is the inevitable consequence of American "aid" for Japanese rearmament. U.S. Secretary of State Dulles, at a press conference on September 3, 1953, demanded that Japan bear more of the cost of rearmament and criticized the Yoshida government for not adopting a strict "belt-tightening plan."

    Professor Seijiro Usami of Hosei University, in an article entitled "Accepting MSA Aid Requires the People to Tighten Their Belts" published in the "Chuo Koron" magazine, commented: According to our recent historical experience, American "aid" is provided on the basis of making the people "tighten their belts." In the end, this will only strengthen the monopoly of arms production and undermine the national economy. In the past, due to accepting "special procurement" orders, Japan has severed trade relations with the peaceful and democratic camp. At the same time, the distorted development of military industries has created a sharp contradiction between Japan's industrial production and purchasing power. He pointed out that if Japan accepts MSA "aid," first, Japan will have to increase its military spending. This will inevitably lead to inflation and rising prices, resulting in a more miserable life for the people; second, the Japanese economy will develop one-sidedly towards expanding military industries, which will inevitably expand the import of raw materials for the arms industry while reducing civilian imports. To escape from the economic panic caused by this distorted development, monopoly capitalists will maintain their profits by sacrificing the interests of the working people; third, it will open the way for the free activity of American capital and the dumping of surplus goods in Japan.

    Professor Usami said that the Yoshida government's "belt-tightening" plan, along with the fascistization of the political system after accepting MSA "aid," will plunge the Japanese people into a state of being in a military prison.

### 吉田强迫日本人民“勒紧裤带”重整军备

    吉田强迫日本人民“勒紧裤带”重整军备
    据新华社讯：吉田政府已经在公开要求日本人民“勒紧裤带”，重整军备。
    据共同社报道，吉田在公开演说中着重强调要日本人民忍受物质缺乏的生活，他甚至说：“如果现政府和自由党因此而失去国民的信任，那是国民的责任。”
    日本公众已经愈来愈清楚地看到：“勒紧裤带”是美国“援助”日本重整军备的必然发展。美国国务卿杜勒斯在一九五三年九月三日的记者招待会上曾要求日本担负起更多的重整军备的费用，并对吉田政府没有采取严格的“勒紧裤带计划”加以指责。
    日本法政大学教授宇佐美诚次郎曾在“中央公论”杂志上以“接受共同安全署援助是要求国民勒紧裤带”为题发表评论说：根据我们最近的历史经验，美国的“援助”是在使国民“勒紧裤带”的基础上进行的。从结果来看，这只会加强军火生产的垄断和破坏国民经济。过去，由于接受了“特需”订货，已使日本与和平民主阵营断绝了贸易关系。同时，由于军事工业的畸形发展，已使日本的工业生产和购买力发生了尖锐矛盾。他指出：如果日本接受了共同安全署“援助”，第一，日本要增加军费负担。这就不能不产生通货膨胀和物价上涨，结果使国民的生活更陷入悲惨状态；第二，日本经济要朝着片面地扩大军事工业的方向发展，这就一定要扩大军火工业的原料输入而削减民用输入。垄断资本家为了从这种畸形发展的经济恐慌中脱身，将用牺牲劳动人民的利益来保持它的利润；第三，给美国资本在日本的自由活动和剩余商品的推销开辟了道路。
    宇佐美教授说：吉田政府这种“勒紧裤带”的计划，将和接受共同安全署“援助”以后的政治体制的法西斯化一道，使日本人民陷于置身军事监狱的状态中。
