Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 22nd: Four more captured personnel of the Korean People's Army were repatriated today, including two who risked their lives to escape during the process of the US side escorting prisoners of war. One prisoner of war named Li Zhongyi, after special agents discovered he wanted to return to his country in November last year, had one of his legs broken and ten large characters tattooed on his arm to increase his fear.

To date, 630 captured personnel from the Korean and Chinese sides have returned from the Dongchang-ri prisoner of war camp. They risked their lives to escape the violent control of special agents and returned to Panmunjom one after another, revealing a large number of facts, confirming the consistent crime of the US side forcibly detaining prisoners of war, and causing the US side to be thoroughly bankrupt politically and morally.

    四名我方被俘人员冲出美方控制遣返归来
    【新华社开城二十二日电】今日下午又有四名朝鲜人民军被俘人员被遣返回来，其中有两名是在美方押走战俘的过程中冒死逃出来的。一个名叫李忠一的战俘，在去年十一月间特务发觉他想回国后，把他的一条腿打断了，并在臂上刺了十个大字，以增加他的疑惧。
    至此，从东场里战俘营归来的朝中被俘人员已有六百三十名。他们冒着性命危险逃脱特务的暴力控制归来，先后在板门店揭露了大量事实，证实了美方强迫扣留战俘的一贯罪行，使美方在政治上和道义上彻底破产。
