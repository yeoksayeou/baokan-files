In conducting the publicity and education of the general line of the state, consciously educating the peasant masses, especially the Communist Party members and Youth League members in rural areas, to love agricultural labor and exert their wisdom and strength to promote the socialist transformation of agriculture, further develop agricultural production, and build a better hometown is an important link that cannot be ignored.

In the past few years, the vast number of rural Party members and Youth League members have made great contributions to the restoration and development of agricultural production. They actively responded to the various calls of the People's Government, took the lead in carrying out the patriotic production increase and mutual aid and cooperation movements, and implemented the Party's rural policies. Especially in the recent months, because they have studied the general line and realized that the current task of rural Party members and Youth League members is to strive for the realization of the socialist transformation of agriculture, they have actively taken the lead in selling surplus grain to the state and enthusiastically planning to develop cooperatives and mutual aid teams, carrying out winter production and preparations for spring plowing. Because of this, thousands of Party members and Youth League members have won the glorious title of various models. Li Shunda, a Communist Party member from Ping Shun County, Shanxi Province, is a good example. Li Shunda's hometown, Xigou Village, used to be a poor mountain village. For more than ten years, due to Li Shunda's leadership in organizing mutual aid teams for the villagers and later establishing an agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry production cooperative, the village's production has improved year by year, and the income of farmers has increased year by year, turning the poor Xigou into a rich Xigou. Li Shunda has also formulated a three-year development plan. This year, he will develop the cooperative to about 150 households and establish two branches, striving to increase grain production by 30 jin per mu. He will also mobilize farmers who have not been organized to participate in mutual aid and cooperation organizations and plant more fruit trees on barren mountains. Li Shunda wants to turn his hometown into a mountain village that is not only prosperous but also beautiful. The direction of Li Shunda's efforts is the direction of the joint efforts of all Party members and Youth League members in rural areas.

However, because industrial construction has been given the top priority, many rural Party members and Youth League members have developed a mood of uneasiness or insufficient ease with agricultural production and are single-mindedly thinking of going to the city and participating in industrial production. On the one hand, this shows their enthusiasm for the country's industrial construction. The country's realization of industrialization also requires some farmers to supplement the ranks of the working class, but the number that needs to be supplemented is still small, and it will increase with the development of industrial construction. In the future, when the city needs to increase workers, it will also formally notify the district and township governments to recruit in an organized and planned manner. It is not good for some farmers to blindly enter the city now. This not only wastes travel expenses and makes futile trips, but also delays production. Rural Party members and Youth League members should not only understand this themselves, but also carry out in-depth and comprehensive publicity and explanation to the broad masses of farmers in order to implement the State Council's "Instructions on Persuading Farmers to Stop Blindly Flowing into Cities" issued last April. From another perspective, some of the comrades among these rural Party members and Youth League members do not have a clear understanding of the development prospects of rural areas and the significance of developing agricultural production, and they do not have a clear understanding of the relationship of mutual dependence and mutual support between industry and agriculture, and therefore think that "doing work is glorious, and farming is shameful." This understanding is one-sided and wrong. To build socialism, industry must be the mainstay. Only in this way can a solid socialist foundation be established, and only then can agricultural machinery be manufactured to further develop agricultural production and supply farmers with cheap industrial products. But this cannot be used to underestimate agriculture. On the contrary, precisely in order to develop industry, there is a need for sufficient grain to supply cities and a strong national defense army; there is a need for various raw material crops such as cotton, linen, timber, oils, sugar cane, and tobacco to supply industry; and there is a need for non-staple foods such as vegetables, meat, cooking oil, eggs, aquatic products, and fruits to supply the people of the whole country. Not only that, but it is also necessary to export as much surplus and saved agricultural products as possible in exchange for necessary industrial equipment to accelerate the development of China's industry. Therefore, in the process of the country's socialist industrialization, we cannot relax the improvement of agricultural output for a moment, nor can we relax the implementation of socialist transformation of agriculture for a moment. As Stalin put it well: "Anyone who neglects or undermines the interests of agriculture cannot develop industry. They do not understand that if industry is the mainstay of the national economy, then agriculture is the foundation for the development of industry." ("On the Social Democratic Tendencies within the All-Union Communist Party," contained in "On Socialist Economic Construction," Volume 2) He also said: "The general policy of the Party, especially the economic policy, cannot separate industry from agriculture. These two basic economic sectors must be developed in a mutually harmonious direction, so as to integrate into a socialist economy." (Ibid.)

Some rural Party members and Youth League members also want to enter factories and cities because they envy the good life of urban workers. This idea of hoping for a good life is good. The purpose of the country's development of production is to meet the people's growing material and spiritual needs. But the improvement of life must be based on the development of production. The better the labor, the better the life. But some comrades among these Party members and Youth League members do not understand the problem in this way, but think that workers have a good life and work is easy. This is a misunderstanding. In fact, some of today's industrial labor in our country is still heavy manual labor; although other parts use automated or semi-automated machines to reduce manual labor, but because the technology is complex, the spirit needs to be highly concentrated, which is not only not easier than agricultural labor, but also more stressful and onerous than agricultural labor. Also, due to the limitations of conditions, some have to go deep into the strata or work in the high air, and some have to work in very hot places or in gases that are difficult to smell. When the welders Mu Yunpeng and Li Zhenjiu of the Anshan Seamless Steel Tube Plant weld and repair pipes in underground ventilation pipes, they have to lie in the water to work. The air in the pipeline is not very circulated, especially after the oil-proof paper outside the crack in the pipeline is burned by electric fire and emits a bad smell, people are suffocated and faint. When workers at the Taiyuan Iron and Steel Plant rushed to repair the No. 2 blast furnace, they drilled into the furnace to work. Although the furnace temperature had been reduced, it was still smoky and dusty inside, and as hot as a steamer. The working conditions of workers will continue to improve with the development of national construction, but this process of improvement requires hard work to achieve. Speaking of the income of workers is more than that of farmers, because the labor results created by workers are much larger than those of farmers, and wages should naturally be higher. Moreover, workers live in cities, and urban life is higher. They do not have private houses and land, nor do they have sideline income. All living expenses have to be spent. Even if the wages are higher, the current life is not necessarily very good; especially workers with many children still have some difficulties in life. The life of workers will be improved day by day, but this also requires constant hard work to constantly improve. At present, rural life has been greatly improved compared with before liberation, and it will be even greater in the future, but a prosperous life cannot be easily obtained, but must be built through our hard work. Everyone admires the happy life of Soviet collective farms, which was achieved by Soviet farmers after experiencing hard and difficult years. As a Party member or a Youth League member, one cannot take the current good or bad life as the standard for choosing a job. It should be based on striving for a good life for all the people of the country. Through arduous struggle, this good life can be fully realized. Therefore, Party members and Youth League members in rural areas should not avoid the difficult and easy and covet a good life, but should be determined to develop agricultural production mutual aid and cooperation movement, and strive for the arrival of this good life with their own hard work. As long as rural Party members and Youth League members actively lead mutual aid and cooperation and develop agricultural production, rural life will also gradually improve.

There are also some rural Party members and Youth League members who want to leave the countryside and go to the city because they have a certain level of education and dislike the backwardness of the countryside. It should be admitted that today's rural areas are relatively backward in terms of economy and culture, which has its deep historical and social roots. But precisely because it is backward, it needs to be transformed. The purpose of the country's socialist transformation of agriculture is not only to make the countryside prosperous, but also to make the countryside civilized, so that every farmer in our country becomes a rich and cultured person. Who do we rely on to transform? Mainly rely on the Party organizations in rural areas and the Party's assistants and reserve forces - the Youth League organizations. The millions of Party members and Youth League members in rural areas are the vanguards and backbones of the Party's unity and education of farmers to realize the socialist transformation of agriculture. Today, the struggle between the two roads in rural areas is becoming increasingly obvious. The Party has determined to lead farmers to take the socialist road, so every Party member and Youth League member in rural areas should become a conscious propagandist and organizer of socialism. But educating farmers cannot be done by "talking empty words," but must use one's own practical actions to lead the broad masses of farmers to move forward together. Therefore, Party members and Youth League members in rural areas should take the lead in doing a good job in cooperatives and mutual aid teams, work hard to increase production, walk in front of others, and set a good example for the broad masses of farmers, so that they have a model to follow. At the same time, the broad masses of farmers are watching Party members and Youth League members and following Party members and Youth League members. If our rural Party members and Youth League members themselves are not at ease with agricultural production and abandon the rural work front, then capitalism will occupy this front, the remnants of the landlord class will also take the opportunity to move around, and the shadow of the old tragic fate will also fall upon the broad masses of farmers, and the countryside will still be backward forever, which is unimaginable. In order to accelerate the change of this backward situation, the responsibility of all Party members and Youth League members in rural areas, especially Party members and Youth League members with culture, is significant. Running cooperatives, doing publicity and education work, improving agricultural cultivation techniques, and carrying out mass cultural activities all require a large number of excellent Party members, Youth League members, and activists to take the lead, and require some backbone personnel with a certain culture. Take the agricultural production cooperative as an example. At present, there are only more than 14,000 cooperatives in the country. In the future, there will not be tens of thousands of cooperatives, but hundreds of thousands or millions. This requires many presidents, vice-presidents, accountants, production team leaders, agricultural technicians, and agricultural scientists to manage and guide agricultural production. To do these jobs well, it is impossible without culture. In the future, when agriculture is collectivized and mechanized, more people with culture will be needed. There are too few intellectuals in rural areas now. Therefore, many elderly farmers hope that their children with some culture can stay in the countryside and inherit and carry forward their careers. It is no accident that the Youth League members, primary school students, and middle school students in Shandong, Jilin, and other provinces who participated in agricultural labor were warmly welcomed by local farmers.

In order to complete the socialist transformation of agriculture, we will still encounter many resistances and difficulties. Capitalist elements in rural areas will try every means to obstruct, reactionaries will also plot sabotage, and the habitual forces of millions of farmers require us to painstakingly persuade them. Moreover, for a considerable period of time, many places will have to continue to use backward and simple production tools and fight against natural disasters. If rural Party members and Youth League members do not face up to these difficulties and think that it is easy to achieve the goal, they will disarm themselves ideologically. But if they fear difficulties, bow their heads in the face of difficulties, or try to escape difficulties and wait for others to overcome the difficulties before enjoying them, then they will lose the noble qualities of Party members and Youth League members. According to the report of the Chinese Farmers' Delegation after visiting the Soviet Union, many chairmen of collective farms in the Soviet Union are old chairmen of more than ten to thirty years; many agronomists, accountants, and production team leaders of many farms have also continued to serve for more than ten to twenty years; many old farmers in their seventies and eighties, with the care of their children and the subsidies of collective farms, could have lived a leisurely life, but they are still actively working; therefore, a large number of socialist labor heroes and model outstanding figures have emerged from farms all over the Soviet Union, and they have been admired by the people of the Soviet Union and the world. The spirit of Soviet farmers who love agricultural labor and work diligently in agricultural production all their lives is our glorious example.

The focus of our country's general line in the transition period is naturally socialist industrialization, but it must also be coordinated with the socialist transformation of agriculture; the focus of the first five-year plan is naturally the development of heavy industry, but agricultural economy must also be developed accordingly. The Party's emphasis on agricultural production is not only in the past, but also in the present, and will be in the future. In order to promote the socialist transformation of agriculture and further improve agricultural production, the CPC Central Committee has also issued the "Resolution on the Development of Agricultural Production Cooperatives," stipulating that from the winter of 1953 to the autumn harvest of 1954, the number of agricultural production cooperatives in the country should be increased from the existing 14,000 to more than 35,800. It also stipulates that "developing the mutual aid and cooperation movement to improve agricultural productivity is the center of the Party's leadership of rural work in the future. Party organizations in rural areas, district committees, county committees, general prefectural committees, provincial committees that mainly manage rural areas, and all cadres above the provincial committee level who are engaged in rural work must gradually shift the focus of their work to this aspect." This means that after the leadership center of the whole Party is shifted from rural areas to cities, it does not mean that the Party does not attach importance to agriculture or abandons agriculture, but on the contrary, the Party must lead agriculture with considerable strength at the same time. In agricultural areas, the Party committees should still focus on leading agriculture, especially leading the development of socialist factors in agricultural cooperatives. Therefore, any idea that underestimates agricultural production and is not at ease with rural work is wrong.

In order to educate rural Party members and Youth League members to love agricultural labor and love socialism, it is necessary to further improve the leadership of county and district Party committees, especially to improve the education work for rural Party members and Youth League members. The education work for Party members and Youth League members should be regularized, and they should be given socialist education at all times. In the Party organizations of counties and districts in various places, there are indeed many cadres who often pay attention to educating rural Party members and Youth League members, and work with Party members and Youth League members to find ways to overcome difficulties and avoid avoidable mistakes. These cadres are learning models for rural Party members and Youth League members, and the local Party committees should rely on and unite these cadres to do a good job in rural work. But for some cadres who underestimate rural work and are not at ease with rural work because they do not recognize the great significance of rural work, they should also be patiently educated and helped to recognize the important significance of agricultural production, go deep into the peasants, learn production knowledge, learn agricultural technology, go deep into the grassroots organizations of the Party and the Youth League in rural areas, understand and solve the difficulties and requirements of farmers and Party members and Youth League members in work and production, so that they can settle down in rural work and agricultural production. On the other hand, the county and district Party committees should organize culture to go to the countryside, enliven rural life, and care about the advanced studies of rural intellectuals, so as to meet the progressive requirements of rural Party members and Youth League members, so that they can continue to progress politically, culturally, and in agricultural technology, and truly become the main force in promoting the country's socialist transformation of agriculture.

### 教育农村党员和团员热爱农业劳动

    教育农村党员和团员热爱农业劳动
    在进行国家总路线的宣传教育中，有意识地教育农民群众首先是农村中的共产党员和青年团员，热爱农业劳动，发挥自己的智慧和力量，来促进农业的社会主义改造，更加发展农业生产，建设美好的家乡，是一个不可忽略的重要环节。
    几年来，在恢复和发展农业生产方面，广大农村党员和团员是有着很大的贡献的。他们积极地响应人民政府的各项号召，带头开展爱国增产和互助合作运动，贯彻执行了党的农村政策。特别是最近几个月来，由于他们学习了总路线，认识到目前农村党员和团员的任务，是为实现农业的社会主义改造而奋斗，所以积极地带头把余粮卖给国家，并热心筹划发展合作社和互助组，进行冬季生产和春耕的准备工作。正因为如此，成千上万的党员和团员获得了各种模范的光荣称号。山西平顺县共产党员李顺达，就是一个很好的榜样。李顺达的家乡西沟村，过去是一个穷苦的山村。十几年来，由于李顺达领导全村农民先组织互助组，以后又成立了农林畜牧生产合作社，全村的生产就一年比一年好，农民的收入就一年比一年多，穷西沟变成了富西沟。李顺达又订了一个三年发展计划，今年就要把合作社发展到一百五十户左右，并建立两个分社，争取每亩土地增产粮食三十斤，还要发动没有组织起来的农户都参加互助合作组织，在荒山上栽种更多的果树。李顺达要把自己的家乡变成一个不仅富裕而且是美丽的山庄。李顺达努力的方向，就是农村全体党员和团员共同努力的方向。
    但是，由于工业建设提到了第一位，不少的农村党员和团员，却因此产生了不安心或不够安心于农业生产的情绪，一心想到城市，一心想参加工业生产。这一方面，是表现了他们热心于祖国的工业建设。国家实现工业化，也需要一部分农民来补充工人阶级的队伍，但是，目前需要补充的数量还不大，以后会随着工业建设的发展而增加。将来城市需要增加工人时，也会正式通知区、乡政府有组织有计划地招收。现在有些农民盲目入城是不好的，这不但浪费路费，徒劳往返，而且要耽误生产。农村党员、团员不但自己要了解这点，而且要向广大农民进行深入全面的宣传解释，以贯彻政务院于去年四月所发布的“关于劝止农民盲目流入城市的指示”。从另一方面看，这一部分农村党员、团员中有的同志对于农村的发展前途和发展农业生产的意义是认识不清的，对于工业和农业相互依赖和相互支援的关系是认识不清的，因而认为“做工光荣，务农丢人”。这种认识是片面的，也是错误的。建设社会主义，必须以工业为主体，只有这样，才能建立巩固的社会主义基础，也才能制造出农业机械来进一步发展农业生产和供给农民以便宜的工业用品。但是不能因此就可以轻视农业。相反的，正是为了发展工业，就需要有足够的粮食来供应城市和强大的国防军队；就需要有棉、麻、木材、油脂、甘蔗、烟叶等各项原料作物来供应工业；就需要有蔬菜、肉类、食油、蛋品、水产、水果等副食品供应全国人民。不仅如此，而且需要尽可能地输出富余的和节约下来的农产品，换回必需的工业装备，以加速我国工业的发展。因此，在国家社会主义工业化的过程中，我们是一刻也不能放松农业产量的提高，一刻也不能放松对农业实行社会主义改造的。斯大林说得好：“谁如果忽视或破坏了农业底利益，谁就不能发展工业。他们不了解：如果工业是国民经济底主脑，那末，农业便是发展工业的基础了。”（“论联共党内社会民主主义的倾向”，载“论社会主义经济建设”下册）他又说：“本党一般的政策，特别是经济政策，是不能使工业与农业分开的。必须使这两个基本经济部门照着互相融洽的方向发展，以至于综合成为一个社会主义的经济。”
  （同上）
    也有部分农村党员和团员，是因为羡慕城市工人的生活好而要进工厂、进城市的。这种希望过好生活的思想是好的，国家发展生产的目的，就是为了满足人民日益增长的物质和精神的需要。但是生活的改善必须在生产发展的基础上，劳动得好，生活就好。但是这些党员、团员中有的同志不是这样去理解问题，而是认为工人生活好，劳动轻松。这是一种误解。事实上，我国今天的工业劳动，一部分还是沉重的体力劳动；另一部分虽然使用了自动化或半自动化的机器，减少了体力劳动，但由于技术复杂，精神需要高度的集中，不但不比农业劳动轻松，而且比农业劳动紧张繁重得多。又因为条件的限制，有的要深入地层或在高空中作工，有的要在很热的地方或很难闻的气体中作工。鞍山无缝钢管厂电焊工穆云鹏、李振久两人在地下通风管焊补管道时，就要躺在水里工作，管道里空气不大流通，特别在管道裂缝外面的防油纸被电火烧着发出臭味后，人就被窒息得昏过去。太原钢铁厂工人在抢修第二号炼铁炉时，钻到炉内去工作，虽然炉温已经降低，但里面仍是烟熏、土呛，热的像个蒸笼。工人的劳动条件是会随着国家建设的发展而不断改进的，但这一改进的过程是需要辛苦劳动才能争取得来的。说到工人的收入是比农民多，因为工人创造的劳动成果比农民大得多，工资自然就应该多一点。而且工人住在城市，城市的生活较高，他们没有私人的房屋和土地，也没有副业收入，一切生活用费都要花钱，即使是工资多一些，目前的生活不一定很好；尤其是子女较多的工人，在生活上还有些困难。工人的生活是会日益提高的，但这也是需要不断辛勤的劳动才能不断改善的。目前农村生活比解放前已经大大改善，将来还会更大的改善，但富裕的生活是不能轻易得到的，而要靠我们辛勤的劳动去建设。大家都欣羡苏联集体农庄的幸福生活，这是苏联农民经历过艰苦困难的岁月后才达到了的。作为一个党员或一个团员就不能以目前的生活好坏作为选择工作的标准。应该以争取全国人民都过美好的生活为标准。经过艰苦奋斗，这种美好的生活是完全可以实现的。因此农村中的党员、团员不能避重就轻地贪图好生活，应当是下定决心发展农业生产互助合作运动，用自己的辛苦的劳动去争取这种美好生活的到来，只要农村党员团员积极领导互助合作，发展农业生产，农村的生活也一样会逐步提高的。
    还有一部分农村党员和团员，因为自己有了一定的文化程度，就嫌农村落后，因而想离开农村到城市去。应该承认，今天的农村在经济上文化上是比较落后的，这有它深刻的历史根源和社会根源。但是正因为它落后，所以就需要改造。国家对农业实现社会主义改造的目的，不但是要使农村富裕起来，也要使农村文明起来，使我国农民一个个都成为富裕的和有文化的人。依靠什么人来改造呢？主要的是依靠农村中党的组织以及党的助手和后备队伍——团的组织。农村中几百万党员和团员，正是党团结与教育农民实现农业的社会主义改造的先锋和骨干。今天农村中，两条道路的斗争已越来越明显。党确定了要带领农民走社会主义的路，因此农村中的每个党员和团员，就应当成为社会主义自觉的宣传者和组织者。但是教育农民是不能“空口说白话”的，必须用自己的实际行动来带动广大农民共同前进。因此，农村中党员和团员就应当带头搞好合作社、互助组，努力增加生产，走在别人的前面，为广大农民作好样子，使他们有了可以遵循的榜样。同时，广大农民正是眼望着党员、团员，跟着党员、团员走的。如果我们农村党员和团员自己不安心于农业生产，放弃了农村工作阵地，那么，资本主义就要去占领这个阵地，地主阶级余孽也要乘机活动，旧日悲惨命运的阴影也将重临于广大农民的面前，农村也还要永远落后下去，那是难以想像的事。为着加速改变这个落后的情况，农村中一切党员和团员尤其有文化的党员和团员的责任是重大的。办合作社，作宣传教育工作，改进农业耕作技术，开展群众文化活动等等，都需要有大批优秀的党、团员和积极分子起带头作用，并需要一部分有一定的文化的骨干。就拿办农业生产合作社来说吧，现在全国只有一万四千多个合作社，将来，合作社不是几万个，而是几十万个，几百万个。这样就需要很多的社长、副社长、会计、生产队长、农业技术人员、农业科学人员，来管理与指导农业生产。要做好这些工作，没有文化是不行的。将来农业实行集体化机械化后，有文化的人需要的更多。现在农村中的知识分子实在太少了，因此，许多老年农民都希望着他们有点文化的子弟，能够留在农村，继承和发扬他们的事业。山东、吉林等省的青年团员、小学和中学生参加了农业劳动，受到当地农民热烈的欢迎，决不是偶然的事情。
    为着要完成农业的社会主义改造事业，我们还会遭到很多的抗拒和困难。农村中的资本主义分子会千方百计地来阻挠，反动分子也要阴谋破坏，千百万农民的习惯势力，需要我们苦口婆心地去说服，而且，在一个相当长的时期内，许多地方还得继续使用落后的简单的生产工具，还要与自然灾害作斗争。农村党员、团员如果不正视这些困难，以为很容易达到目的，就会解除自己思想上的武装。但如果畏惧困难，在困难面前低头，或希图逃避困难，等别人克服了困难自己再去享受，那就丧失了党员和团员的高贵品质。据中国农民代表团到苏联参观回国后的报告，苏联有许多集体农庄主席，都是十多年至三十年的老主席；许多农庄的农学家、会计和生产队长等人，也都继续担任了十几年到二十几年；有许多七、八十岁的老农民，有儿女的侍养，有集体农庄的补助，本来可以安闲地养老，但他们还在积极劳动；因而，大批的社会主义劳动英雄和模范优秀人物，不断从全苏联各地农庄中涌现了出来，他们受到了全苏联和全世界人民的钦敬。苏联农民这种热爱农业劳动，终身勤劳于农业生产的精神，正是我们光辉的榜样。
    我们国家在过渡时期总路线的重点自然是社会主义工业化，但也必须配合进行对农业的社会主义改造；第一个五年计划的重点自然是发展重工业，但也必须相应地发展农业经济。党对农业生产不只是过去重视，现在重视，将来也是重视的。为了促进对农业的社会主义改造，更进一步地提高农业生产，中共中央又发表了“关于发展农业生产合作社的决议”，规定从一九五三年冬到一九五四年秋收以前，全国农业生产合作社应从现有的一万四千多个发展到三万五千八百多个。并规定“发展互助合作运动以提高农业生产力是今后党领导农村工作的中心。农村中的党组织、区委、县委、一般的地委、以管理农村为主要工作的省委和省委一级以上一切从事农村工作的干部，都必须把工作的重点逐步转移到这个方面来”。这就是说全党的领导中心由农村转到城市以后，并不等于说党就不重视农业或抛弃农业了，而恰恰相反，党必须以相当的力量同时领导农业，在农业地区的党委则仍然应以领导农业、特别是领导发展社会主义因素的农业合作社为工作中心。因而任何轻视农业生产和不安心农村工作的思想都是错误的。
    为了教育农村党员、团员热爱农业劳动，热爱社会主义，就需要进一步改善县、区党委的领导，特别是需要改善对农村党员、团员的教育工作。要把对党员、团员的教育工作经常起来，时刻对他们进行社会主义教育。在各地县、区党组织中，确有不少干部，是经常注意对农村党员、团员进行教育，并和党员、团员一道想办法克服困难，避免可以避免的错误。这些干部是农村党员、团员的学习榜样，当地党委就应该紧紧的依靠和团结这些干部来搞好农村工作。但是对于某些由于不认识农村工作的重大意义而轻视农村工作不安心农村工作的干部，也要耐心地教育帮助他们，使他们认识农业生产的重要意义，深入到农民中去，学习生产知识，学习农业技术，深入到农村党和团的基层组织中去，了解与解决农民和党员团员工作和生产中的困难与要求，使他们安心农村工作和农业生产。另一方面，县、区党委应当组织文化下乡，活跃农村生活，关心农村知识分子的进修，以满足农村党员、团员的进步要求，使他们在政治上、文化上和农业技术上能不断前进，真正成为推进国家对农业实行社会主义改造的主力军。
