Xinhua News Agency, 26th: New Delhi dispatch: Indian Prime Minister Nehru delivered a foreign policy speech at the Indian National Congress Party meeting held in Kalyani on the 23rd.

　　Nehru criticized the US unilateral handling of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and handing them over to the Syngman Rhee clique and the Kuomintang bandits. He said: "Thousands of prisoners of war were transported to Taiwan even before they were released, and the remaining prisoners of war were handed over to the South Korean government of Syngman Rhee, a participant in the Korean War." This was "very inappropriate." Nehru continued: "It is said that their prisoners have been freed, but I simply cannot see what freedom they have in sending these prisoners of war to countries where they cannot act according to their own wishes at all."
　　When Nehru talked about the legitimate status of the People's Republic of China in the United Nations, he said: India has always believed that without the participation of the People's Republic of China, the United Nations cannot become a "United Nations" organization. He said: "Some people think that as long as they close their eyes to the People's China, they can make this country non-existent. This is impossible."
　　When talking about the current international situation, Nehru said: "We firmly believe that the current problems can be resolved by peaceful means, and that every country can live according to the way of life it chooses without imposing its own set on others."
　　Nehru commented on the US military aid to Pakistan, saying: "This is not at all a question of a rich and powerful country aiding underdeveloped countries, but a fundamental question involving the peace and freedom of many countries in Asia. … If Pakistan accepts this kind of aid, it will become part of a large national group confronting another national group. It has become a potential war zone, and its policies will gradually be controlled by other countries.

    【新华社二十六日讯】新德里消息：印度总理尼赫鲁二十三日在卡利阿尼举行的印度国大党会议上发表外交政策演说。
    尼赫鲁抨击美方片面处理朝中战俘并把他们移交给李承晚集团和国民党匪帮。他说：“成千的战俘甚至在还没有释放以前就被运往台湾，而其余的战俘被交给朝鲜战争的参加者李承晚的南朝鲜政府”，这是“非常不适当的”。尼赫鲁接着说：“据说他们的俘虏已经得到自由，但是把这些战俘送到那些他们丝毫不能按照他们自己的愿望行事的国家去，我简直看不出他们有什么自由。”
    尼赫鲁谈到中华人民共和国在联合国中的合法地位时说：印度一向认为，没有中华人民共和国参加的话，联合国就不能成为一个“联合国”的组织。他说：“有些人认为，只要对人民中国闭起眼睛，就可以使这个国家不存在。这是不可能的。”
    尼赫鲁在谈到目前国际局势时说：“我们深信目前的问题可以用和平的方法来解决，而每一个国家都可以按照它选择的生活方式生活下去而不需把它自己的一套强加在别人身上。”
    尼赫鲁评论美国以军事援助给予巴基斯坦一事说：“这完全不是一个富强的国家援助开发落后国家的问题，而是要牵涉到亚洲许多国家的和平与自由的根本问题。……假若巴基斯坦接受了这种援助，它就成了和另一国家集团对垒的某一大的国家集团的一部分。它变成了潜在的战争地区，它的政策也要逐渐受到其他国家的控制。
