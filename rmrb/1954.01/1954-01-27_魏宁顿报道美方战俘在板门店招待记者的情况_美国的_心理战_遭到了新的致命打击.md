Xinhua News Agency, 26th. According to a report from Panmunjom by Alan Weinington, reporter for the British "Daily Worker": America's "psychological warfare" suffered a fatal blow here today. American and South Korean POWs who refused repatriation, and one British POW, walked into Peace Hall today, sitting down a mere three feet away from American reporters for an hour and a half. The POWs explained why they refused to go home. At an unprecedented press conference and later television interview, the POWs abandoned by the Indian Custodial Forces said they were requesting the Korean and Chinese side to accept them back—not as POWs, but "as free men." At 11:00 a.m. this morning, all 347 POWs walked out of the open gate of the camp, carrying silk flags, doves of peace, and various slogans, including "Down with McCarthyism" and "This is America's War, Not a United Nations Police Action." They were warmly dressed, healthy, and brought a dog with a sign around its neck that read "Unexplained." The POWs, reporters from both sides, and neutral nations crowded into a hall, where the POWs read a statement explaining why they refused to go home and then answered questions for over an hour. The POWs said that in South Korea, there were firing squads, concentration camps, forced conscription, landlords, and poverty. In the United States, there was McCarthyism, persecution of progressives, the tragic fate of progressive-minded POWs who returned to the United States, lynching, and racial discrimination. In Britain, there was American occupation, with Britons fighting for America in Korea, and potentially fighting for America in Indochina and Pakistan. If they went back, their speech would be suppressed, so they intended to do their best overseas to promote world peace until they could return to their homelands without necessarily becoming targets of persecution. At the press conference, infuriated American reporters tried desperately to prove that these American POWs had always been coerced into staying. Two American POWs, described by news agencies as "wearing daggers" to prevent other American POWs from returning home, stood up in front of everyone and urged all other POWs to go home if they wished. This provoked bursts of laughter. But the myth of coercing POWs was completely debunked by the following situation. Under the sunshine, hundreds of POWs, reporters, and observers mingled freely, with no guards nearby, and American and British reporters could freely pick a POW and pull him aside for a private conversation while television cameras were rolling. POWs told many reporters that there was lynching in the United States and a gang of foxes ruling in South Korea. An American-Belgian said: "I lived under Hitler's rule for five years, and I don't want McCarthy to finish what Hitler started." The only British POW, Marine Corderon, chimed in from the back, telling reporters that he felt fighting for peace overseas would serve the British people better than completing his five-year naval service. Corderon told me, "Britain is rapidly becoming an American colony." "I enlisted to defend Britain, and then I found out I was fighting for America in Korea. I will never be fooled again." A South Korean woman was asked: Did she have any relatives in South Korea? She sharply replied: "They were all killed by American bombs." The POWs said they had written a letter to General Thimayya, asking him to "assist us in requesting the Korean and Chinese side... to receive us as free men." The POWs explained that they believed that the neutral nations had no right to hand them back as POWs, just as the Korean and Chinese POWs had recently been handed over to the United Nations Command; nor did the Korean and Chinese side have any right to release them if the Korean and Chinese side received them as POWs. Therefore, they asked to be received as "free men." The reporters—especially the American reporters—mingled freely with the POWs for over three hours. Afterwards, the POWs sang songs as they walked back to their camp, waiting for the Korean and Chinese side to respond to their request to be received as free men. They said they had ample supplies, fuel, and cigarettes and lacked nothing.

　　魏宁顿报道美方战俘在板门店招待记者的情况
　　美国的“心理战”遭到了新的致命打击
   【新华社二十六日讯】据英国“工人日报”记者阿兰·魏宁顿自板门店报道：美国的“心理战”今天在这里遭到了致命的打击。拒绝遣返的美国战俘、南朝鲜战俘和一个英国战俘在今天走向和平厅，在距美国记者们仅三英尺远的地方坐下来为时达一小时半之久。战俘们就他们为什么拒绝回家作了解释。在空前的记者招待会以及后来的电视访问节目上，被印度看管部队抛在一边的战俘们说：他们正在请求朝中方面接纳他们回去——不是作为战俘，而是“作为自由人”。今天早上十一点钟，全部三百四十七名战俘走出大门敞开着的营场，他们带着绸制的旗，和平鸽和各种标语，上面写着“打倒麦卡锡主义”、“这是美国的战争，而不是什么联合国的警察行动”。他们穿着温暖的衣服，身体健康，带着一条狗走向板门店。这条狗挂着一个牌子，上面写着“未经解释的”。战俘们，双方的记者们和中立国人士满满地挤在一个大厅里，战俘们在那里宣读一项声明，说明为什么他们拒绝回家，然后答复人们向他们提出的各项问题，为时达一小时以上。战俘们说，在南朝鲜，有执刑队、集中营、强征兵役、地主和贫困。在美国，有麦卡锡主义、对进步人士的迫害、返回美国去的有进步思想的战俘们所遭受的悲惨的命运、私刑和种族歧视。在英国，有美国的占领，英国人在朝鲜为美国打仗，而且可能在印度支那和巴基斯坦为美国打仗。如果他们回去的话，他们的言论就将受到压制，因此他们打算在海外尽他们的力量，来促进世界和平，直到他们能够返回他们的祖国而不致必然成为被迫害的目标。在记者招待会上，恼恨万分的美国记者们竭力企图设法证明这些美国战俘总是受了胁迫而留下来不走的。被各通讯社形容为“佩带匕首”以防止其他美国战俘回家的两个美国战俘在大家面前站起来，并且敦促所有其他的战俘回家去，如果他们愿意的话。这时候就引起了一阵阵哄堂大笑。但是胁迫战俘的神话在下面这种情况下完全不攻自破了。在阳光照耀之下，数以百计的战俘们，记者们和观察员们随随便便地混在一起，没有一个警卫在附近的地方，而且美国和英国记者们当有人在进行电视照相的时候，可以随便挑一个战俘，把他拉在一边和他作私下的谈话。战俘们对许多记者说，在美国有私刑，在南朝鲜有狐群狗党的统治。一个美籍比利时人说：“我在希特勒统治之下生活了五个年头，我不希望让麦卡锡来完成希特勒所开始的勾当。”唯一的英国战俘海军陆战队士兵康德伦从后边接上来对记者们说，他觉得在海外为和平作斗争比回去服完五年的海军兵役更能为英国人民服务。康德伦对我说，“英国正在急转直下地成为美国的殖民地。”“我投军是为了保卫英国，而后来我发现我是为美国在朝鲜作战。我决不再上当了。”有人问一个南朝鲜女人：她在南朝鲜有什么亲人？她尖锐地回答说：“他们都被美国炸弹炸死了。”战俘们说，他们给蒂迈雅将军写了一封信，要求他“协助我们要求朝中方面……把我们当自由的人来加以接收。”战俘们解释说，他们认为，中立国无权把他们作为战俘交回去，就像朝中战俘最近被交给联合国军司令部那样；朝中方面也没有任何权利把他们释放，如果朝中方面把他们作为战俘接收的话。因此他们要求把他们作为“自由人”而接收他们。记者们——特别是美国记者们——随随便便地和战俘们混在一起达三小时以上，之后，战俘们唱着歌走回他们的营场，等待朝中方面就他们要求把他们当作自由人来接收一事给予答复。他们说他们有充分的供应品、燃料和纸烟，什么也不缺。
