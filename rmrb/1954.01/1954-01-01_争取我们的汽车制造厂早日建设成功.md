    The victorious year of 1953 has passed. This year was the first year of our implementation of the nation's first Five-Year Plan, and also the first year our country began constructing the automobile manufacturing plant. Under the loving care of Chairman Mao and the brilliant illumination of the Party's General Line, with the direct assistance and guidance of Soviet experts, and the strong support of the people nationwide, all the staff and workers of our First Automobile Manufacturing Plant overfulfilled the annual plan for the five main factory buildings by more than two times last year. This is a huge victory in the nation's industrial construction. Let all of our staff and workers take this victory as a gift to the New Year!
    In the past, under the rule of imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries, not only could our country not manufacture automobiles, but even the few small automobile repair shops were incomplete and dilapidated. Therefore, the construction of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant is truly a joyous event in the lives of the Chinese people. We believe that in the near future, after this factory is completed, our country will be able to manufacture its own automobiles. At that time, transportation will be more convenient. Farmers will be able to load the agricultural and native products needed by the country for production and construction onto automobiles made by ourselves and quickly transport them to the cities; the various industrial products produced by the workers to supply the countryside can also be transported more smoothly to the countryside. All the staff and workers of our First Automobile Manufacturing Plant know how eagerly everyone in the country is looking forward to the early success of our automobile manufacturing plant!
    In 1954, the scale of the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant's project will be even more enormous. The area of civil construction will reach more than 550,000 square meters, and ten factory buildings will be constructed simultaneously. Therefore, we will never be satisfied with last year's achievements. We are determined to continue to contribute our greatest strength to the Party and to the First Automobile Manufacturing Plant. We must, with strong will, in the construction of 1954, on the road of our country's realization of socialist industrialization, bring into play a high degree of initiative and creativity, earnestly implement the suggestions of Soviet experts, strive to improve technology, comprehensively fulfill and overfulfill the national plan, and enable our automobile manufacturing plant to be built successfully as soon as possible.

    争取我们的汽车制造厂早日建设成功
    第一汽车制造厂先进生产者　杨德鸿　李贵  李锡海　赵志　兰海山　韩德斌  苏兰清　崔春启　张进怀　钟长乐
    一九五三年胜利的过去了，这一年是我们执行国家第一个五年计划的第一年，也是我们国家开始兴建汽车制造厂的第一年。我们第一汽车制造厂的全体职工，在毛主席的亲切关怀和党的总路线的光辉照耀下，在苏联专家直接的帮助和指导下，加上全国人民的大力支援，去年超额完成五个主要厂房全年计划的两倍多。这是国家工业建设中的一个巨大的胜利，让我们全体职工把这个胜利作为献给新年的礼物吧！
    过去，在帝国主义和国民党反动统治下，我国不但不能制造汽车，仅有的一些小型汽车修理厂也是残缺不全。所以，第一汽车制造厂的建设，真是我国人民生活中的一件大喜事。我们想到在不久的将来，这个工厂建成以后，我国就能自己制造汽车了。那时，交通运输也就更方便了，农民供给国家生产建设需要的农产品和土产品，可以装上我们自己制造的汽车很快地运到城市；工人们生产的各种各样的供应农村的工业品，也可以更顺利地运到农村里去了。我们第一汽车制造厂的全体职工都知道，全国的每一个人都是多么热烈地盼望我们汽车制造厂早日建设成功啊！
    一九五四年，第一汽车制造厂的工程规模更加巨大，土木建筑工程面积要达五十五万多平方公尺，有十个厂房要同时兴建。所以，我们决不满足去年的成绩，我们决心继续拿出最大的力量贡献给党，贡献给第一汽车制造厂。我们要以坚强的意志，在一九五四年的建设中，在我们国家实现社会主义工业化的道路上，发挥高度的积极性和创造性，认真贯彻苏联专家的建议，努力提高技术，全面完成和超额完成国家计划，使我们的汽车制造厂早日建设成功。
