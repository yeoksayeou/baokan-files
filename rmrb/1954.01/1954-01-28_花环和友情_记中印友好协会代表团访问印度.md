Garlands and Friendship
　　——A Record of the Sino-Indian Friendship Association Delegation's Visit to India
　　Yuan Shuipai
　　In just one afternoon, the plane took us from Hong Kong to Rangoon. The golden top of the Shwedagon Pagoda sparkled in the sunset.

　　Continuing our flight, we arrived at Calcutta, India's largest city, that night. The next day, December 8th, after a four-hour flight, we arrived at India's capital – New Delhi. Thousands of smiling faces greeted us. One garland after another was placed around our necks. Showers of rose petals rained down on us. The five-star red flag and the Indian flag of orange, white, and green with a spinning wheel in the middle, along with banners and paper emblems of peace doves, all rushed towards us. Our bodies seemed to float on the waves of slogans and cheers, involuntarily carried forward by the welcoming crowd. It was not until our familiar friend, the gray-haired Professor Gyan Chand, introduced the head of the delegation, Ding Xilin, to deliver a speech, that people settled down.

　　Dr. Chand, on behalf of the Preparatory Committee for the All-India Conference of the Indo-China Friendship Association, particularly pointed out that we were a delegation sent by Chinese people's organizations at the invitation of the Indian people. He said, "They come from the Chinese people to the Indian people." These words aroused a strong reaction, making both host and guest feel even closer!

　　When Delegation Head Ding Xilin spoke of the friendship between the two ancient and awakened nations of China and India as a great force for safeguarding peace in Asia and the world, the entire venue seemed to boil over.

　　During their speeches, the crowd frequently shouted in Hindi: "Long live Sino-Indian friendship!" "India and China are brothers!"

　　This enthusiastic cry accompanied our delegation from then on. No matter where we went, whether it was a city or a village, a school or a factory, a city hall or a chamber of commerce, every train station we passed through, whether it was the living room of a member of parliament or a judge, a writer's club or a banana garden, a coconut grove... throughout the south and north of India, ports and inland areas, this cry resounded everywhere.

　　From this cry, we deeply felt the strong friendship of the broad masses of Indian people towards New China and their love for peace and democracy. For two hundred years, their ancestors had suffered the cruel and greedy oppression and exploitation of imperialism. It was not until after World War II that the direct rule of British colonialists ended. However, the deep imprint of this bloody rule is still etched on the land of India today.

　　The sunshine is so abundant here, shining year-round on the evergreen fields. Crops and fruit trees grow so easily. "Today, if you throw a papaya seed on the ground, in eight or nine months, you can pick papayas from that tree," people told me. But everyone knows that India's annual grain production is not enough to eat. Coupled with frequent droughts and floods, famine is still unavoidable. A large number of farmers lose their land, and many workers and staff in the cities are also unemployed.

　　The Indian people are very clear that in the past, the Chinese people suffered the same fate as them, but now "a miracle has happened, it seems like a dream." This is what Dr. Kitchlew, winner of the Stalin International Peace Prize, said after returning from China. This is the common feeling of many Indian politicians, social celebrities, writers, artists, professors, members of parliament, and other widely representative figures who have visited China. In Delhi and elsewhere, Indian friends frequently asked us with great interest about how our country is carrying out large-scale economic construction, especially the situation of agriculture and water conservancy projects, as well as people's employment, education, and medical care. Some friends wanted to understand the work of social reform, while others kept asking carefully from big topics down to the amount of a worker's salary and the number of children's school fees they had to bear.

　　During the trip, the heads of the Indo-China Friendship Association accompanying us sometimes enthusiastically answered questions for us, or couldn't help but interject a few words while we were answering. Their enthusiasm made us even more aware of the close unity between the people. Many of the people accompanying us had been to New China. In the past four years, nearly two hundred Indian friends have personally seen the situation in various aspects of our country. They have become experts who understand New China. After returning to their country, they gave speeches, made talks, and wrote articles. Many people have also written books. Sundarlal, who was elected chairman of the All-India Indo-China Friendship Association this time, wrote a book "Today's China," Vice Chairman and editor of the "Blitz" weekly, Karanjia, published his book "China Rises," and writer K.A. Abbas wrote a book "Under the Leadership of Mao Zedong." Their friendly language is one of the most powerful factors in promoting understanding and cooperation between the people of the two countries.

　　But there are also individual figures with special backgrounds who seized the opportunity to make some boring slanders against New China. This slander quickly became a laughingstock that exposed their own faces. One person called Ra. Ga. Hutsing was such a person. He came to China twice, seemingly specifically to write a book with ulterior motives. The book is called "The Window of China" and was published in both India and the United States. The United States Information Service in India regarded this book as a treasure and publicized it widely. I have not read this book, but I saw an interesting book review in the "Blitz" weekly. This Hutsing dared to boldly and clumsily say in the book: "There is not a single smiling face in New China." The author of the book review was Abbas, a writer who came to China with him. In his article full of spicy satire, Abbas inserted seven photos, each with the smiling faces of Chinese working people. The author said: "The photo album can prove the liar's lies." At the end of his article, Abbas asked an "embarrassing" question: The paper and printing of this book are good, but the price is surprisingly cheap, and he wants the author of the book to explain the reason.

　　But such examples are extremely rare. It seems like a small piece of scum floating on the sea. Of course, there are still people among the Indian people who do not understand us, and there are also people who have been affected by malicious propaganda. But in any case, due to the two thousand years of traditional friendship between China and India, the Indian people's goodwill and trust towards us is unshakable and cannot be destroyed.

　　The national organization of the Indo-China Friendship Association was formally established on December 13 after a three-day meeting. In the future, the understanding and friendship between the people of the two countries, as well as the cultural and economic exchanges between the two countries, will undoubtedly be further strengthened.

　　During the days in Delhi, Indian President Dr. Prasad, Vice President Dr. Radhakrishnan, and Prime Minister Nehru received the delegation. In addition, we also met with many Indian government officials, social celebrities, and cultural and artistic workers.

　　During the meeting, representatives of the Soviet, Czechoslovak, Hungarian, and other embassies in India also attended to congratulate us. The person in charge of the Sino-Ceylon Friendship Association of Ceylon made a special trip from Ceylon to participate, which further showed how much the friendship between the people of China and India is valued by the peace-loving people of Asia and the world.

　　After the successful conclusion of the national conference, the citizens of Delhi held a mass rally of 10,000 people in Urdu Square to welcome the delegation. The enthusiastic situation was unforgettable.

　　Urdu Square is in the old city of Delhi. Before coming here to attend the meeting, we had never been to the old city. We had always been in the new city. This Indian capital is located on the banks of the Jumna River, a tributary of the Ganges, and is divided into two parts: the new and old cities. New Delhi was only built in this century and is the political center of the country, with huge buildings left over from the past rulers of India, including the Presidential Palace and the Parliament. These buildings are surrounded by wide asphalt roads, gardens, lawns, and fountains. During the day, the sunlight shines on the buildings inlaid with two kinds of red sandstone, deep and light. In the thick shade of the huge banyan trees, it looks even brighter. Roses and other flowers bloom dazzlingly beside the walls of the spacious residences. Emerald green parrots fly in the bushes. A long summer of tropical scenery. In the evening, colored electric lights illuminate the water spewing out of the fountains, making it seem like rose water or tangerine juice.

　　This is the new city. The old city is different. There are winding narrow streets, crowded shops and stalls. Bullock carts, rickshaws, and scantily clad crowds jostle each other. Our guide said, here you can see the simple India.

　　The mass rally was held in a square next to an ancient Muslim mosque. Nearly 10,000 people attended from afternoon until evening. Although our position was on a temporary platform, we all sat cross-legged like the masses below, following the Indian custom. This was welcomed by them. Pandit Sundarlal, this veteran of the Congress Party, Gandhian, and also the head of the 1951 Indian goodwill delegation to China, the newly established chairman of the All-India Indo-China Friendship Association, and the most enthusiastic promoter of Sino-Indian friendship, gave a speech in Hindi. He sat down to speak, as if talking heart-to-heart with the masses. His earnest words often aroused enthusiastic applause from the audience. Sometimes he spoke with tears in his eyes, and the audience also wiped their eyes with him. Unfortunately, we could not understand his language. Mrs. Chand, who was sitting near us, translated some for us in English. He repeatedly emphasized the importance of Sino-Indian friendship, believing that India's friendship with China was by no means a trivial matter, but a matter of life and death. He said: "We and China are in the same boat, we will float together and sink together." He excitedly criticized the aggressive conspiracy of the United States and Pakistan to conclude a military agreement, and angrily denounced the dark activities of American agents. He exposed the rumors of warmongers provoking Sino-Indian relations, saying that no force can destroy the friendship between us. He repeatedly explained that the unity of the people of China and India is a guarantee of peace in Asia and the world. His words were reflected back by the high walls of the mosque across the square, making a clear echo. His words aroused a strong reaction in the hearts of the tens of thousands of listeners below the stage, including those Muslim women wearing veils. They repeatedly responded to the old man's call with applause and slogans.

　　In his speech, Delegation Head Ding Xilin quoted Chairman Mao's words on January 26, 1951, celebrating the first anniversary of the founding of the Republic of India, praising "the Indian nation is a great nation, and the Indian people are very good people." After I traveled in Delhi and other cities and villages in India, and after I personally came into contact with and saw the brave and firm Indian working people, I realized the meaning of Chairman Mao's words even more.

　　We ended the grand event by singing the national anthems of the two countries together with our Indian friends. At that time, the streets around the square were already lit up. The venue was very crowded, and the masses automatically pulled up their hands and made a lane for a few of us to pass through to the edge of the square to get on the bus. As we walked, people reached out to shake hands with us. Even after sitting in the car, some people still put their hands into the car window. I still clearly remember a middle-aged man who looked like a coolie, with a face full of short gray-white whiskers, leaning his head in from the car window. His face was dark and thin, and the two eyeballs deeply sunken in his eye sockets were staring closely at my face, as if trying to see clearly. Because it was very dark in the square, and there was no light in the car. Finally, he smiled slightly at me. A branch-like rough hand full of protruding veins reached out to me. I immediately reached out and shook his hand tightly. (Picture attached)

　　花环和友情
　　——记中印友好协会代表团访问印度
    袁水拍
    仅仅一个下午的时间，飞机就把我们从香港送到仰光。大金塔的金顶在夕阳里闪光。
    继续飞行，当夜到达印度最大城市加尔各答。第二天十二月八日下午飞四小时，到达印度的首都——新德里。成千个微笑的脸迎着我们。一个又
  一个的花环套在我们脖子上。阵雨似的玫瑰花瓣洒在我们身上。五星红旗和橙白绿三色、中间有一个纺车轮子的印度国旗，还有标语牌、和平鸽的纸徽，一起拥向我们。我们的身体好像已经浮起在口号和欢呼的声浪上，不由自主地被欢迎群众簇拥着向前走。直到我们所熟悉的友人、灰白头发的老教授吉安·昌德博士介绍代表团丁西林团长致词，人们才定下来。
    昌德博士代表印中友协全国会议筹备委员会特别指出，我们是接受印度人民的邀请而来的中国人民团体所派的代表团，他说：“他们从中国人民那里到印度人民这里来。”这话引起了强烈的反应，使主客双方感觉到更加亲密！
    当丁西林团长说到中印两大古老而觉醒了的民族之间的友谊，是保卫亚洲和世界和平的巨大力量的时候，整个会场好像沸腾了一样。
    在他们两位致词当中，群众不时用印地语高呼：“印中友谊万岁！”“印度中国是兄弟！”
    这热情的呼声从此一直伴随着我们代表团。不论我们走到哪里，是城市或者农村，是学校或者工厂，是市政厅或者商会会所，每一个我们所经过的火车站，不论是国会议员或者法官的客厅，作家的俱乐部或者芭蕉园、椰树林……印度的南和北，港口和内地，到处响着这呼声。
    从这呼声里，我们深刻地感到了广大的印度人民对新中国的强烈的友好，他们对和平民主的热爱。两百年来，他们祖祖辈辈受着帝国主义的凶残贪婪的压迫和榨取。直到第二次大战后才结束了英国殖民者的直接统治。可是这种血腥统治的深刻烙印今天依旧蚀刻在印度的大地上。
    阳光在这里是那么多，它成年地照射着四季常青的田野。庄稼、果木是这样地容易成长，“今天你把一颗木瓜子丢在地里，八、九个月以后，你就可以从这棵树上摘木瓜吃。”人们这样告诉我。可是谁都知道，印度每年生产的粮食不够吃，再加上经常有旱灾和水灾，因此至今不能避免饥荒的一再发生。大批农民失掉耕地，城市里的工人和职员也有许多没有工做。
    印度人民很清楚，过去中国人民也遭受着和他们一样的命运，但现在却“发生了奇迹，看来好像是梦一样”。这是获得斯大林国际和平奖金的克其鲁博士从中国回去以后所说的话。这是许多访问过中国的印度政治家、社会名流、作家、艺术家、教授、议员等具有广泛代表性的人物的共同感觉。在德里和别处，印度友人经常怀着极大的兴趣问到我们，关于我国怎样进行大规模的经济建设，特别是农业和水利工程的情况，以及人民就业、教育、医疗等问题。有些朋友，希望了解社会改革的工作，有些人则一直从大题目仔细地问到一个工人的工资以及所负担的子女学费的数目。
    在旅行中，陪伴我们的印中友协的负责人有时热心地代我们回答问题，或者在我们回答的时候，忍不住插进来答复几句。他们的热情，更使我们体会到人民与人民之间的亲密团结。陪伴我们的人，好些是曾经来过新中国的。四年来，已经有将近二百个印度友人亲自看到了我国各方面的情况。他们已经成为懂得新中国的专门家。他们回国以后作了演讲，发表了谈话，写了文章。写出成本书的也有不少人。这次当选为全印印中友协主席的森德拉尔写了一本“今天的中国”，副主席和“闪电”周报主编卡朗吉亚出版了他所著的“中国站起来了”，作家克·阿·阿巴斯写了一本“在毛泽东的领导下”。他们的充满友谊的语言，是促进两国人民之间的了解和合作的最有力的因素之一。
      但也有个别的具有特殊背景的人物，窃取机会对新中国作了一些无聊的诽谤。这种诽谤很快就变成暴露自己面目的笑谈。有一个叫做拉·加·胡特辛格的，就是这样一个人。他两次来华，似乎是专门为了写一本别具用心的书。书名“中国之窗”，在印度和美国两处出版。在印度的美国新闻处把这本书当作宝贝，大事宣扬。我没有读到这本书，但我在“闪电”周报上看到一篇有趣的书评。这个胡特辛格竟大胆地、也是拙劣地在书里说：“新中国没有一张笑脸。”书评的作者是和他一起来华的作家阿巴斯。阿巴斯在他的充满辛辣的讽刺的文章里插了七张照片，每一张上都有微笑着的中国劳动人民的面影。作者说：“镜箱就可以证明造谣家的说谎。”阿巴斯在他文章的末尾问了一个“令人难堪”的问题：这本书的纸张印刷都好，可是书价却出奇的贱，他要书的作者解释其中道理。
    但这种事例是极少的，它好像是飘浮在大海上的一小块渣子。当然，印度人民中间也还有不了解我们的人，也还有受过恶意宣传影响的人。但不管怎样，由于中印两国两千年来的传统友谊，印度人民对我们的亲善和信任是无可动摇、不能破坏的。
    印中友好协会全国性的机构经过三天的会议后，在十二月十三日正式成立。今后两国人民之间的了解和友好，以及两国文化和经济方面的交流，无疑将更进一步地加强。
    在德里的几天内，印度总统普拉沙德博士、副总统拉德哈克里希南博士、总理尼赫鲁接见了代表团。此外我们还和许多印度政府官员、社会名流、文化艺术工作者会了面。
    在开会期间，苏联、捷克斯洛伐克、匈牙利等驻印使馆的代表也出席祝贺，锡兰的锡中友好协会负责人特地从锡兰赶来参加，更显出中印两国人民的友谊怎样受到亚洲和世界爱好和平人民的重视。
    在全国会议胜利闭幕以后，德里市民在乌尔都广场举行了一万人的群众大会来欢迎代表团。热烈的情况是令人难忘的。
    乌尔都广场在德里旧城。来这儿开会以前，我们还没有来过旧城。一直是在新城。这个印度首都位在恒河的支流琼那河河滨，分新旧城两个部分。新德里是本世纪才建立的，而是全国政治中心，有过去印度统治者遗留下来的巨大建筑物，包括总统府、国会等。这些建筑的周围有广阔的柏油路、花园、草地和喷泉。白天，阳光照着深淡两种红砂石镶配的建筑，在巨大的榕树的浓荫下，显得更加明亮，玫瑰和别的花夺目地开在宽敞的住宅的墙边。碧绿的鹦鹉在树丛里飞翔。一派长夏的热带风光。到了晚间，彩色电灯照得喷水池里放射出来的水好像是玫瑰水或是橘柑汁。
    这是新城。旧城就不一样，那儿是曲折窄狭的街道，挨挨挤挤的小店和摊子。牛车、人力车和衣着简陋的人群拥挤着。我们的向导说，这儿你可以看到纯朴的印度。
    群众大会在一座古老的回教大寺院旁边的广场上召开。将近一万人从下午一直开到晚上。我们的位置虽在临时搭起的平台上，但我们都照印度的习惯，和台下的群众一样盘膝而坐。这件事得到他们的欢迎。潘迪特·森德拉尔，这位国大党元老、甘地主义者，也是一九五一年印度亲善访华团团长、新成立的全印印中友协主席、促进印中友谊的最热情的鼓动家，用印地语发表演讲。他坐着说，好像和群众促膝而谈。他的恳切的说话时常引起听众的热烈鼓掌。有时他说得声泪俱下，听众也随着他揩自己的眼睛。可惜我们听不懂他的语言。坐在我们近旁的昌德博士夫人给我们用英语翻译了一些。他一再强调印中友谊的重要性，认为印度对中国友好，决不是什么无关紧要的问题，而是生死的问题。他说：“我们和中国是在一只船里，我们要一起浮，一起沉。”他激动地抨击美国和巴基斯坦订立军事协定的侵略阴谋，愤怒地斥责美国特务的黑暗活动。他揭露战争贩子挑拨中印关系的谣言，说没有任何力量可以破坏我们之间的友谊。他反复说明，印中两国人民的团结是亚洲和世界和平的保障。他的语言被广场对面寺院的高墙反射回来，发出清晰的回声。他的语言，在台下的成万听众心里，包括那些蒙着面幕的回教妇女在内，激起了强烈的反应。他们一再用鼓掌和口号来回答这位老人的号召。
    丁西林团长在致辞中，引用了毛主席在一九五一年一月二十六日庆祝印度共和国成立一周年说的话，赞扬“印度民族是伟大的民族，印度人民是很好的人民”。当我在德里和印度其他城市和农村旅行之后，当我亲自接触了、看到了勇敢坚定的印度劳动人民之后，更体会到毛主席的这些话的意义。
    我们和印度友人分别高唱两国国歌来结束这个盛会。那时候，广场四周的市街已经亮起了灯光。会场很挤，群众自动地拉起手来，做成一条巷子，让我们几个人通过，走到广场边去上车。我们一路走，一路有人伸出手来和我们握。坐到车里去以后还有人把手伸进车窗里来。我至今清楚地记得，一个苦力模样的、满腮是短的灰白胡髭的中年人，从车窗里探进头来。他的脸是黝黑而干瘦的，两颗深陷在眼窝里的眼珠紧紧地盯着我的脸，好像要极力看个清楚似地。因为广场上很暗，车里更没有光。最后他向我微微一笑。一只满布着突起的筋脉的树枝般粗糙的手伸向我。我立刻伸出手来和他紧紧地相握了。（附图片）
