    The General Line Inspires the Production Enthusiasm of the Workers
      Automatically Increasing Quotas
    Gao Hongzhu is a fitter in the machine shop of the state-owned Shanghai Boiler Factory. In October of last year, he was doing tapping work, and the estimated time was 15 minutes per piece, but in reality, he could drill six pieces. Therefore, in October, his bonus for exceeding the quota was nearly half of his salary. In November, Gao Hongzhu received a batch of copper bracket tasks, which were also new products. The estimated time was one hour per piece, but in reality, it only took 20 minutes. After hearing the report on the General Line, Gao Hongzhu thought about going to the section chief and asking to increase the quota, but after running a few steps, he remembered that he had used the bonus from the previous month to do many things himself. If the quota was lower, he could get more bonuses. Thinking about this, he ran back. However, the report of the Party Committee Secretary appeared in his mind again and again: "The first difficulty in building socialism is the lack of funds. Our working class must strive to increase production and practice thrift, to accumulate more construction funds for the country." Thinking of this, Gao Hongzhu felt very uneasy: "Building socialism is to make everyone live a happy life, but what about me? I am working with a backward quota, taking a dishonorable bonus, and putting the country's construction funds in my own pocket. If everyone is like me, how can we achieve industrialization?" Thinking of this, he immediately ran to the workshop director and asked to change the quota to 20 minutes per piece.
    Under the influence of Gao Hongzhu, more than 40 workers in various workshops have now taken the initiative to ask the leadership to revise the working hour quotas.
      Techniques Conserved for Over Twenty Years Are Now Made Public
    Xu Diankui of the Exploration and Engineering Section of Kailuan Tangshan Mine is a worker with 32 years of experience. He has a unique skill—setting drill bits. But when he sets drill bits, he never lets others watch. Before liberation, his second brother, Xu Dianjia, lost his job because he taught the technique of setting drill bits to others. This incident left a deep impression on Xu Diankui. Therefore, he often thought: "If all the techniques are made public, will it be detrimental to me?"
    However, after Xu Diankui heard the report on the national General Line, a struggle began in his mind. He recalled the improvement of the working class's status and living standards after liberation, especially the benefits brought by the implementation of labor insurance regulations, and he thought even more about the happy socialist society of the future. He also recalled that his son had received a bonus and was supported by the workers for apprenticing at Tangshan Steel Factory. The more he thought about it, the more he hated his past backward thinking, so he made up his mind to teach others the techniques he had conserved for over 20 years.
    After Xu Diankui's thinking cleared, he immediately taught the technique of setting drill bits to his apprentice, Li Fengyu, who was overjoyed. The master and apprentice signed a teaching contract, guaranteeing to teach and learn well.
    Untying Tang Bichun's Mental Knot
    Tang Bichun is an old worker at the private Xin Sheng Machinery Factory in Hankou. He is very skilled, but when he works, he always seems to have something "on his mind" and is never happy.
    Recently, he heard the report on the national General Line during the transition period and participated in group study. He seems younger than before. He happily told everyone he met: "This time, the knot in my mind is untied! In the past, I always thought that working in a private enterprise was just working for the capitalists, and I didn't put much effort into production. Now I understand that our completion of national processing orders is to support the country's socialist construction and to work for our own bright future."
    At this time, the factory received a batch of orders for processing cement mixers, but the "female head" holes on the mixer were too high, the drilling machine was not enough, and the factory did not have an electric drill. It could only drill one hole a day manually. Tang Bichun knew that these were used on construction sites, and failure to complete the task would affect construction. He thought about this all day and night. Later, he came up with a way: he replaced the bed of an old drilling machine with an iron plate frame, which was easy to move and could be raised. He tried it and it only took two hours to drill a hole, increasing work efficiency by eight times.
    Installing Machines is More Important Than Attending Son's Wedding
    Gu Bingfu, an old worker at the joint state-private Wuchang Yuhua Cotton Mill, received a letter from his son Yunlong from Wuxi at the end of last year, asking him to return to his hometown for Gu Yunlong's wedding ceremony on New Year's Day. Gu Bingfu was very happy when he saw the letter. He planned to ask for leave and take his wife back to Wuxi to see his son and daughter-in-law.
    One evening, the chairman of the trade union gave a report on the national General Line, and finally said: "...Now the state has increased an investment in our factory. The state-owned shares in our factory have increased, which means that the socialist economic components have increased. Therefore, I hope everyone will continue to work hard and ensure no absenteeism during the New Year and Spring Festival." Gu Bingfu was very moved when he heard this. He thought: "Really, we must think about long-term interests! If I leave, it will affect the installation of new machines; if everyone asks for leave to go home like me, what will happen to the factory's production? Besides, only by building the country well can young people like my son live a happier and more enjoyable life. Isn't that more meaningful than me rushing back to attend their wedding?" Therefore, he decided not to go back.
    I Will Definitely Not Go to Socialism Empty-Handed
    Wang Wencheng is a forger in Workshop One of the 626 Factory. He started working at the age of 18 and has been working for more than 20 years. The old society made him develop bad habits such as "loafing on the job" and "getting by". After liberation, his old ideas have not completely changed. He would do more work if it was piecework, and less if it was not. He was also not united with the young workers in the group.
    After studying the General Line, the puzzle in his heart was solved. He knew that socialism was not far away! He said: "If I continue to work like I did in the past, I will have to be dragged into socialist society." When the Party branch secretary called on everyone to cherish state property and accumulate funds for socialist construction, he felt like he was being stabbed with needles because he used to not cherish materials, but he was very distressed when his children broke a bowl at home. He said: "Now I realize that if we all don't care about state property, if one worker wastes a drop of oil, the waste of workers across the country will become a river. To get to socialist society faster, everyone must take action, and I can't go empty-handed!"
    One day, after he got off work and returned home, he suddenly saw worker Song Xiwen running over and saying: "There's a quality problem!" Without asking any questions, he rushed to the factory and worked until midnight before returning home.
    The "Special Coal Building Company" No Longer Supplies
    Near the factory building of the Jianghuai Farm Implement Factory in Yancheng, Jiangsu, there is a large ash pile where many women used to pick coal every day, calling it the "Special Coal Building Company". However, recently this "Special Coal Building Company" has stopped supplying. The reason is this: in the past, melting workers in the foundry, furnace workers in the mechanical and electrical room, and firemen in the mess hall threw away the coal that was not completely burned, and others would pick it up and reuse it. Since studying the General Line, the workers in the factory have understood the importance of accumulating construction funds for the country, so they have been using their brains to find ways to save coal. In the past, melting iron in the iron-melting furnace required one part of coke for three parts of iron. After the furnace workers found a way to save it, they can now achieve one part of coke for five parts of iron. They sift the ash from the burned coal and reuse it, so no more combustible coal can be picked out of the ash pile.

### 总路线鼓舞了工人群众的生产热情

    总路线鼓舞了工人群众的生产热情
      自动提高定额
    高鸿柱是国营上海锅炉厂机械车间钳工。他在去年十月份做婆司钻眼生活，估工是一刻钟钻一只，实际上他能钻六只。因此，十月份他得的超额奖金将近工资的半数。十一月份，高鸿柱接到一批铜托架任务，也是新产品，估工一小时一只，实际上只需二十分钟。高鸿柱听过总路线的报告，他想跑去找工段长，要求把定额提高些，可是跑了几步，又想起用上月的奖金自己办了许多事，如果定额低一些，自己还可多得超额奖，想着想着，又跑回来了。但是党委书记的报告，一次又一次的出现在他的脑子里：“建设社会主义第一个困难就是资金缺乏。我们工人阶级要努力增产节约，为国家积累更多的建设资金”。想到这里，高鸿柱内心感到非常不安：“建设社会主义是为了使大家过幸福的生活，我呢？做的是落后的定额，拿的是不光荣的奖金，把国家的建设资金放在自己口袋里，每个人都像我这样，怎能实现工业化呢？”想到这里，立刻跑到车间主任那里，要求把定额改为二十分钟一只。
    在高鸿柱的影响下，现在各车间已有四十多个工人，主动向领导上提出要修改工时定额。
      保守二十多年的技术公开了
    开滦唐山矿开拓工程科徐殿奎，是一个有三十二年工龄的工人。他有一手拿人的技术——镶钻头。但是他在镶钻头时，从来不让别人看。解放前，他二哥徐殿甲因为把镶钻头的技术教给了别人，自己失了业。这件事对徐殿奎印象很深。因此，他时常想：“技术都公开了，是否对自己不利？”
    可是，徐殿奎听了国家总路线的报告后，思想上就斗争开了。他想起了解放后工人阶级地位的提高、生活的改善、尤其是实行劳保条例带来的好处，更想到了将来的幸福的社会主义社会。他又想起自己的儿子在唐山钢厂作工因带徒弟得了奖金，又受到工人的拥护。他越想越恨自己过去的思想落后，于是下定决心要把保守二十多年的技术教给别人。
    徐殿奎思想通了以后，马上就要把镶钻头的技术教给他所带的徒弟李凤玉，李凤玉真是欢喜的不得了，师徒两人签订了教学合同，保证教好学好。
    解开了唐必春的思想疙瘩
    唐必春是汉口私营新生机器厂的老工人，技术很好，但干起活来总像有什么“心事”似的，老不愉快。
    最近他听了国家过渡时期总路线的报告，又参加了小组的学习。人像比以前年青了，他高兴得见人就说：“这回我思想上的疙瘩解开啦！以前我总认为在私营企业工作只是为资本家干活，生产上搞得不起劲。现在我明白了，我们完成国家加工订货任务，就是支援国家社会主义建设，就是为自己的美好前途工作。”
    这时，厂里接到一批洋灰搅拌机的加工订货任务，但是搅拌机上“母头”眼子太高，钻床不够，厂里又没有电钻，用人工一天只能钻一个。唐必春知道这是工地上用的，若完不成任务就要影响建设。他为这件事，一天到晚都想。后来他想出了一个办法：将一部旧钻床床座子换成了铁板架子，既便于搬动，又可以升高，装起来一试，钻一个眼子只要两小时就行了，提高了工作效率八倍。
    安装机器比参加儿子的婚礼要紧
    公私合营武昌裕华纱厂老工人顾炳福，去年年底，接到儿子云龙从无锡寄来一封信，要他元旦回乡参加顾云龙的结婚典礼。顾炳福看了信，心里很高兴。便打算请假带着老伴回无锡一趟，看看儿子和儿媳。
    一天晚上，工会主席作关于国家总路线的报告，最后说：“……现在国家又在我们厂里增加了一笔投资。我们厂里的公股又增多了，也就是说，社会主义经济成分增多了。所以，希望大家继续努力生产，在新年和春节期间保证不缺勤。”顾炳福听了这段话，很受感动。他想：“真的，我们要为长远利益着想呀！我走了，影响新机器的安装；要是大家都像我这样请假回家，那厂里的生产怎么办呢？再说，只有把国家建设好，像我儿子那样的青年人，才能过着更幸福愉快的生活，那不是比我赶回去参加他们的婚礼的意义更大些吗？”因此，他决定不回去了。
    决不空着手到社会主义去
    王文成是六二六厂一车间一个锻工，他从十八岁开始做工，到现在已经二十多年。旧社会使他养成了“磨洋工”、“混饭吃”的坏习惯。解放后，他的老思想还没有完全改变，要是计件的活就干的多，不计件的就不多干。在小组里和青年工人也不团结。
    学习总路线后，他心里的闷葫芦打开了。知道离社会主义社会不远啦！他说：“如果还像我过去那样干的话，就得叫人拖到社会主义社会。”当党支部书记号召大家要爱护国家财产，给社会主义建设积累资金时，他心里就像针扎一样的难受，因为他过去对材料就不爱护，但家里小孩子打一个碗却很心痛。他说：“现在我认识到如果我们都不关心国家财产，一个工人浪费一滴油，全国工人的浪费就会成了大河。要快些到社会主义社会就要大家动手，我也不能空着手去呀！”
    有一天，他下班回家后，忽然见工人宋希文跑来说：“质量出了问题！”他二话没问，就急忙跑到工厂，一直工作到半夜才回家。
    “特约煤建公司”不再供应了
    江苏盐城江淮农具厂厂房附近有一个大灰堆，过去每天有许多妇女在那儿拣煤炭，她们称它为：
  “特约煤建公司”。可是，最近这个“特约煤建公司”却不供应了。事情原来是这样的：翻砂间熔炼工人、机电间炉子工人和伙食房烧火工人过去烧的煤还没有烧透就丢在灰堆不要了，别人便拣去重用。自学习总路线后，该厂工人懂得了为国家积累建设资金的重要意义，于是纷纷动脑筋想办法节约用煤。熔铁炉过去熔铁，焦炭一成铁三成，自烧炉工人想办法节省后，现在做到炭一成铁五成。烧过的煤炭，他们把灰筛净再用，这样灰堆里就再也拣不出可以烧的煤炭了。
