　　Ministry of Heavy Industry and Ministry of Fuel Industry Instruct Subordinate Units
　　Mobilize Workers to Ensure Normal Production Before and After the Spring Festival
　　State-Owned Coal Mines Exceed Coal Production Plan for the First and Second Ten Days of January
    [Our Newspaper] To ensure normal production before and after the Spring Festival and strive to complete the state production plan for the first quarter in a balanced manner, the Ministry of Heavy Industry and the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government have separately instructed their subordinate units to mobilize workers to actively attend work during the Spring Festival.
    Among the 22 major products of factories and mines under the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry, only 10 completed their production plans in the first ten days of January. The reasons for not completing the plan were many accidents, many unplanned repairs, and low attendance rates, but the most fundamental reason was that some factories and mines experienced a phenomenon of relaxation at the beginning of the year. For example, some workers at the Jiangxi Pangu Mountain Tungsten Mine believed that "the task for 1953 has been completed, and 1954 has just begun, so we can relax a bit." In the Yangjia Zhangzi Mine in Northeast China, the attendance rate of shift workers on January 2nd and 3rd was as low as 78 percent. Now that the Spring Festival is approaching, it is most likely to cause a low attendance rate. In order to ensure normal production before and after the Spring Festival and ensure the completion of the state production plan, the Central Ministry of Heavy Industry has instructed leading cadres at all levels of the heavy industry system to do the following: First, each bureau (company) should regularly check the completion of production plans of its subordinate enterprises, pay special attention to preventing relaxation, and organize inspections of key factories and mines; second, leading cadres of each production factory and mine should contact the Party committee and the trade union to conduct propaganda and education among the employees of their enterprises, mobilize employees in continuous production departments not to be absent from work without reason, and ensure the balanced completion and over-completion of the state production plan.
    According to the state's requirements, the output of state-owned coal mines across the country must reach 23 percent of the annual task in the first quarter of this year. In order to complete this rather arduous task, the Ministry of Fuel Industry of the Central People's Government instructed all coal mines across the country to actively prepare for production in the fourth quarter of last year. The Coal Mine Management Bureau also convened a meeting of directors of major coal mine management bureaus to specifically discuss how to ensure the completion of production tasks and further consider how to make full use of the remaining production time to strengthen the repair and maintenance of equipment. Therefore, the phenomenon of tight production in the second half of the month instead of the first half has begun to change in national state-owned coal mines this year. At present, state-owned coal mines across the country have exceeded the coal production plan for the first and second ten days of January this year by 0.45 percent. Among them, the completion of tasks by various units in East China is better, generally exceeding the original plan; the Northeast region only completed 98.13 percent of the output plan. Among the 30 state-owned coal mines across the country, 22 units exceeded the plan; several large units such as Fushun, Fuxin, and Datong coal mines did not complete the output plan well enough. In order to better complete the production task and ensure that production can be carried out in a balanced and safe manner, the Central Ministry of Fuel Industry has issued instructions to its subordinate units to "prevent a decline in attendance rates before and after the Spring Festival and ensure production and ensure the loading of coking coal." The North China Coal Mine Administration also requires each mine to combine the study of the general line, call on employees to ensure attendance before and after the Spring Festival, and at the same time widely carry out Spring Festival recreational activities, do a good job in family work, and reward outstanding employees and groups who have not been absent from work throughout the year. In addition, some mines have also prepared some houses to entertain workers' families who come from other places during the Spring Festival.

　　重工业部和燃料工业部分别指示所属单位
　　动员职工保证春节前后正常生产
　　国营煤矿超额完成一月上、中旬产煤计划
    【本报讯】　为了保证春节前后生产能够正常进行，争取均衡地完成第一季度国家生产计划，中央人民政府重工业部和燃料工业部已分别指示所属单位，动员职工在春节期间踊跃出勤。
    中央重工业部所属厂矿的二十二种主要产品，一月份上旬仅有十种完成了生产计划。完不成计划的原因是事故多、非计划检修多、出勤率低，但最根本的原因是有些厂矿发生了年初松劲的现象。如江西盘古山钨矿有些工人认为“一九五三年已完成任务，一九五四年刚开始，可以松一口气”。东北杨家杖子矿一月二、三日运转工的出勤率竟低到百分之七十八。现在春节已近，最容易发生出勤率低的现象，中央重工业部为了保证春节前后正常生产，保证完成国家生产计划，已指示重工业系统各级领导干部做好下列几项工作：一、各局（公司）应经常检查所属企业生产计划完成情况，特别注意防止松劲现象，并要组织对重点厂矿的检查；二、各生产厂矿的领导干部应与党委、工会联系，对本企业的职工进行宣传教育，动员连续生产部门的职工不无故缺勤，保证均衡地完成和超额完成国家生产计划。
    根据国家要求，今年第一季度全国国营煤矿的产量必须达到全年任务的百分之二十三，为了完成这个相当艰巨的任务，中央人民政府燃料工业部在去年第四季就指示全国各煤矿积极做好生产准备工作，煤矿管理总局并召集各大区煤矿管理局局长会议，具体讨论如何保证生产任务的完成，并进一步考虑如何充分利用生产剩余时间，加强设备的检修和维护工作，因此，今年全国国营煤矿生产上前松后紧的现象开始有了改变。现在，全国国营煤矿已超额百分之零点四五完成了今年一月份上、中两旬的产煤计划。其中以华东区各单位完成任务的情况较好，一般都超过原订计划；东北区仅完成产量计划的百分之九十八点一三。全国三十个国营煤矿中，有二十二个单位超过计划；几个大的单位如抚顺、阜新、大同等煤矿，产量计划完成的情况都不够好。为了更好的完成生产任务，使生产能够均衡地、安全地进行，中央燃料工业部已向所属单位发出“防止春节前后出勤率降低和保证生产、保证炼焦煤装车”的指示。华北煤矿管理局并要求各矿结合总路线的学习，号召职工保证春节前后的出勤，同时广泛地开展春节文娱活动，做好家属工作，奖励全年不缺勤的优秀职工和小组。此外，有的矿并准备了一部分房屋，招待在春节期间从外地来的工人家属。
