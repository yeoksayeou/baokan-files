    The fuel industry system has comprehensively overfulfilled the state production plan for 1953. The output of various major products, such as raw coal, electricity, crude oil, gasoline, kerosene, and diesel oil, all exceeded the state plan by 3.3 to 47.5 percent. The total output value fulfilled 105.7 percent of the plan, an increase of 17.3 percent compared to 1952. Among them, coal fulfilled 106 percent, an increase of 9.5 percent compared to 1952; electricity fulfilled 103.7 percent, an increase of 23.9 percent compared to 1952; and petroleum fulfilled 108.6 percent, an increase of 32.6 percent compared to 1952. The labor productivity of production workers also increased by 16 percent compared to 1952. Due to the overfulfillment of most major economic and technical indicators, the production cost was not only reduced by 4.66 percent compared to the plan, but also overfulfilled the profit remittance plan by 22 percent.
    The production capacity of state-owned coal, electricity, and petroleum is constantly expanding. In 1953, the national coal mine output (including state-owned, locally state-owned, and private) has already exceeded the highest production level in history. The amount of crude oil transported eastward from Yumen is also constantly increasing, which has improved the equipment utilization rate of oil refineries in East China, Northeast China, and other places.
    In 1953, two newly built open-pit coal mines and thirteen newly built or expanded thermal power plants or hydro-generators participated in production, including six large-scale projects aided by the Soviet government in the construction of our country. The generating capacity of the newly installed generators last year was equivalent to 19.2 percent of the original total capacity of state-owned power plants. Last year, various regions tapped a lot of potential capacity by adjusting load, unified dispatching, and helping users save electricity. The participation of these new coal mines and power stations in production has ensured the fuel and power needed by the constantly developing light and heavy industries and transportation industries in various places.

    燃料工业系统全面完成去年计划
    全国煤矿产量超过历史上最高生产水平
    【本报讯】中央人民政府燃料工业部系统已全面超额完成一九五三年的国家生产计划。各种主要产品：原煤、电、原油、汽油、煤油、柴油等的产量都超额完成了国家计划百分之三点三到四十七点五。生产总值完成计划百分之一百零五点七，较一九五二年增长百分之十七点三。其中煤完成了百分之一百零六，较一九五二年增长百分之九点五；电完成百分之一百零三点七，较一九五二年增长百分之二十三点九；石油完成百分之一百零八点六，较一九五二年增长百分之三十二点六。生产工人的劳动生产率也较一九五二年提高百分之十六。由于各项主要经济技术指标大部超额完成，不仅使生产成本比计划降低了百分之四点六六，并超额完成了上缴利润计划百分之二十二。
    国营煤、电、石油的生产能力正在不断扩大。一九五三年全国煤矿产量（包括国营、地方国营及私营）业已超过历史上最高生产水平。玉门原油东运数量也不断增加，这就使华东、东北等地炼油厂的设备利用率得以提高。
    在一九五三年中，全国有两个新建的露天煤矿和十三个新建或扩建的火力发电站或水轮发电机参加了生产，其中有苏联政府帮助我国建设的规模巨大的工程六项。去年新安装的发电机的发电容量相当于国营电厂原有总容量的百分之十九点二。各地区去年用调整负荷、统一调度及帮助用户节约用电等方法，挖掘出了不少的潜在能力。这些新煤矿和新电站参加生产，就使各地在不断发展中的轻重工业和交通运输业所需要的燃料和动力有了保证。
