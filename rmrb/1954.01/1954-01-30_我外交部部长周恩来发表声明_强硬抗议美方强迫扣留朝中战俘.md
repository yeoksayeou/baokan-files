Xinhua News Agency, January 29th: Statement by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, regarding the United Nations Command's forcible detention of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. The full text is as follows:

I. On January 20th and 21st, 1954, the United States openly violated the agreement between the two sides of the Korean armistice regarding the issue of prisoners of war. Using force and threats of force, they forcibly transported over 21,900 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to Pohang and Gunsan in South Korea and Keelung in Taiwan, respectively, forcing them to join the armies of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, completely depriving them of the freedom and right to apply to return home and live a peaceful life. This action by the United States in forcibly detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war has aroused great indignation among the Chinese and Korean people. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China authorizes me to lodge the strongest protest against this.

II. In the process of its work of custody and handling of prisoners of war, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," published "Notice to All Prisoners of War" and "Statement on the Work Situation," formulated "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visits," and issued "Interim Reports of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." We believe that these documents are basically correct. However, every fair measure of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has been met with opposition and threats from the United States, and has been obstructed and sabotaged by Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents under US command in the prisoner of war camps south of the Demilitarized Zone. Faced with the difficulties created single-handedly by the United States, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces have made great efforts in carrying out their tasks; however, they have consistently been unwilling to take effective measures on the key issue of how to deal with the special agent organizations in the southern prisoner of war camps, to disband the special agent organizations, eliminate special agents, and implement isolated explanations in order to maintain and implement the provisions of the "Terms of Reference." On the contrary, the commission recognized the special agents who murdered prisoners of war as so-called prisoner of war "representatives," granting them legitimate status, allowing the special agents to run rampant in the southern prisoner of war camps, threatening prisoners of war with force, disrupting explanations, and obstructing repatriation. Therefore, the explanation work on our side was only carried out for ten days, and more than 85 percent of the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war were unable to hear the explanations at all, let alone have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated. We find this unsatisfactory.

The "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" endowed the commission with the right and responsibility to interpret and implement the "Terms of Reference." According to the "Terms of Reference," the commission argued that the explanation period should be extended and that the future of un-repatriated prisoners of war should be resolved by the Korean Political Conference. The commission also believed that "if the status of prisoners of war is changed by declaring them civilians or by any other means, explanation work and the steps of the political conference need to be implemented before this; these steps must be carried out to a legal end in accordance with the provisions of the above-mentioned terms (of reference). Unless both parties agree on other steps or practices regarding the status and handling of prisoners of war, any unilateral action by any relevant party will not conform to the terms of reference.‚Äù We believe that these arguments and interpretations of the commission are in line with the basic goals and provisions of the "Terms of Reference." But in fact, the commission yielded to US pressure, disregarding the firm opposition of the Korean and Chinese sides, disregarding the solemn protests of the Polish and Czechoslovak commissioners, abandoned its own arguments and interpretations, violated the steps stipulated in the "Terms of Reference," and decided to hand over the un-repatriated prisoners of war to their original detaining parties; even after the United States had clearly expressed its readiness to force Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to join the armies of Rhee and Chiang, these Korean and Chinese prisoners of war were still illegally handed over. This facilitated the implementation of the US plot to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. We cannot but express great regret over this.

III. However, it should be pointed out that the US side bears the undeniable primary responsibility for the current serious situation regarding the prisoner of war issue.

In order to achieve its evil goal of forcibly detaining a large number of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, the United States has long been carrying out a terrorist rule of special agents in the prisoner of war camps. As early as 1951, the US side deployed a large number of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents in the prisoner of war camps in Geoje Island, Jeju Island, Bongam Island, Busan and other places, wantonly destroying the humanitarian principles of the Geneva Convention, and using cruel and inhumane violent means such as torture, beatings, tattooing, and branding to harm the lives of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and insult their personal dignity; subsequently, it carried out illegal bloody "screenings" to obstruct the realization of their desire to be repatriated. At the same time, the US side has consistently insisted on its so-called "voluntary repatriation" and "no forced repatriation" at the armistice negotiation table, which is actually a trick to forcibly detain prisoners of war, making it impossible to resolve the prisoner of war issue for a long time and preventing the Korean armistice from being realized for a long time. It was only due to the repeated efforts of the Korean and Chinese sides and the strong pressure of just public opinion around the world, especially due to the continuous military failures of the US side on the Korean battlefield, that the US side was forced to reach an agreement with the Korean and Chinese sides on the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and finally accepted the armistice.

Although the United States signed the agreement on the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," it still did not abandon its plot to forcibly detain prisoners of war. Only ten days after the "Terms of Reference" were signed, the Syngman Rhee group, with the connivance of the United States, abducted more than 27,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war from June 18th to 22nd, 1953. Although the US side admitted that it would do its best to recover these prisoners of war, it has not yet provided any explanation. After the prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated were handed over to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the US side further strengthened the special agent organizations in the southern prisoner of war camps and the terrorist control over the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. Throughout the entire period of custody by the Indian troops, these special agents wantonly murdered and persecuted prisoners of war who had the desire to be repatriated, and tried every means to obstruct and sabotage the explanation work. The US side also influenced the Swiss and Swedish commissioners to create various difficulties within the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. As a result, all the key provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" were undermined, and the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war's freedom to choose repatriation was therefore impossible to exercise.

In order to avoid the political conference to discuss the handling of prisoners of war, so as to further carry out its plot to forcibly detain prisoners of war, the US side unreasonably interrupted the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference on December 12, 1953. Then, the US side unilaterally announced that the explanation work would end on December 23, 1953, and that the custody of prisoners of war by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should end on January 22, 1954. On January 20th and 21st, 1954, the US side finally dispatched a large number of US armed forces to cooperate with the special agents in the southern prisoner of war camps, and forcibly handed over more than 21,900 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to the Rhee and Chiang armies to serve as cannon fodder. In this way, they finally realized their evil plot to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

Now, anyone can see that the US side arbitrarily destroys international conventions and international agreements, completely obliterates justice and humanitarian principles, and wantonly tramples on human dignity and freedom. The entire process of the so-called psychological warfare conducted by the US side on the issue of prisoners of war proves its complete bankruptcy politically and morally. If this evil policy of the US side is not severely condemned and resolutely stopped, then the special agent terror that the US side is implementing against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war today may be used against the people of any country in the world tomorrow. Therefore, the people of the world who love peace, freedom and justice should resolutely take action to stop the barbaric and brutal special agent terror policy of the US imperialists and to safeguard human freedom, justice and fairness.

IV. The provocative action of the US side in forcibly detaining more than 21,900 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war has completely destroyed the agreement on the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and seriously violated the provisions of Articles 51 and 52 of the Korean Armistice Agreement. This has placed new obstacles in the way of a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. The seriousness of this action by the US side is self-evident. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, adhering to its consistent policy of insisting on a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and in order to prevent the US plot to obstruct the peaceful road in Korea from succeeding, solemnly declares that the US side bears the full responsibility for recovering and accounting to the Korean and Chinese sides at any time for the more than 21,900 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were forcibly detained this time and the more than 27,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were forcibly detained from June 18th to 22nd, 1953; and we reserve the right to submit this issue to the Korean Political Conference and other relevant international conferences for discussion. And no matter when the political conference is held, no matter where these prisoners of war are forcibly detained, as long as the US side does not recover them, we will not give up pursuing this crime of the US side for a single day!

V. In order to promptly arrange the convening of the Korean Political Conference to discuss the issue of prisoners of war and seek a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, the Government of the People's Republic of China and Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea successively issued statements on January 9th and 10th, 1954, advocating the immediate resumption of the bilateral talks on the issue of the Korean Political Conference, and the negotiation representatives of the Korean and Chinese sides also put forward a proposal for the liaison secretaries of both sides to meet immediately to discuss and decide on the date for the resumption of the bilateral talks. Due to this effort by the Chinese and Korean governments, and on the basis of the above-mentioned proposal by the Korean and Chinese negotiation representatives, the meeting of liaison secretaries of both sides began to be held on January 14th, 1954. However, the US side continued to adopt a delaying attitude at the meeting of liaison secretaries of both sides. It rejected the three proposals for the date of resumption of the meeting put forward by the Korean and Chinese sides, and stubbornly insisted unreasonably on holding an administrative meeting of the liaison secretaries of both sides to revise the past meeting records as a condition for resuming the bilateral talks. In this way, the US side has both obstructed the convening of the political conference in the bilateral talks and obstructed the resumption of the bilateral talks in the meeting of liaison secretaries. Therefore, the possibility of convening the Korean Political Conference has become increasingly remote.

However, in order to satisfy the ardent wishes of the Korean and Chinese people and the countries and people of the world who love peace and demand the prompt convening of the Korean Political Conference, the negotiation representatives of the Korean and Chinese sides have now been ordered to directly propose to the US negotiation representatives to resume the bilateral talks at Panmunjom on February 1st, 1954. At the same time, the Korean and Chinese sides also stated that they are prepared to consider in a cautious manner any suggestions that the US side is willing to put forward regarding the date of resumption of the meeting. Therefore, whether the bilateral talks can be resumed in the future will depend on the US side.

VI. It should be pointed out that the reason why the US side wants to delay and obstruct the convening of the Korean Political Conference is not only to evade the discussion of the issue of prisoners of war, but more importantly because some warmongers in the US ruling group oppose a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and try to maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice and maintain the tense situation in the Far East and Asia, so as to facilitate the continued implementation of their policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, so as to seek the greatest profits for the US monopoly capital groups. The war policy of the United States in Asia of actively arming Japan, stepping up military aggression against Southeast Asia, organizing aggressive blocs and expanding the network of military bases also fully reflects the evil attempts of these warmongers. The countries and people of Asia and the world who love peace must be vigilant against this major aggressive conspiracy of the United States, resolutely oppose the US delaying and obstructing policy, and promote the prompt convening of the Korean Political Conference, so that it is possible to move the situation in the Far East and Asia towards further relaxation. The Government and people of the People's Republic of China are willing to join hands with the countries and people of the world who love peace to fight against the war policy of the United States.

VII. The peaceful settlement of the Korean issue has become increasingly difficult due to the US action of forcibly detaining prisoners of war and the policy of obstructing the convening of the political conference. The United Nations, which is responsible for maintaining international peace and security, should immediately promote the resumption of the Eighth United Nations General Assembly to review the serious situation in Korea if it is not willing to completely abandon itself. Now, the US government is doing its utmost to obstruct this. We believe that all countries with peaceful aspirations in the United Nations should resolutely oppose this obstruction conspiracy of the United States and promote the rapid resumption of the United Nations General Assembly. We once again propose, when the United Nations General Assembly discusses the Korean issue, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Central People's Government of the People'
