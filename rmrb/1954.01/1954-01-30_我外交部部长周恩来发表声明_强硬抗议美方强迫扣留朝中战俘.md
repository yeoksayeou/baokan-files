Xinhua News Agency, January 29th: Statement by Zhou Enlai, Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, regarding the United Nations Command's forcible detention of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. The full text is as follows:

I. On January 20th and 21st, 1954, the United States openly violated the agreement between the two sides of the Korean armistice regarding the issue of prisoners of war. Using force and threats of force, they forcibly transported over 21,900 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to Pohang and Gunsan in South Korea and Keelung in Taiwan, respectively, forcing them to join the armies of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek, completely depriving them of the freedom and right to apply to return home and live a peaceful life. This action by the United States in forcibly detaining Korean and Chinese prisoners of war has aroused great indignation among the Chinese and Korean people. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China authorizes me to lodge the strongest protest against this.

II. In the process of its work of custody and handling of prisoners of war, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, in accordance with the provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," published "Notice to All Prisoners of War" and "Statement on the Work Situation," formulated "Detailed Rules for Explanation and Visits," and issued "Interim Reports of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission." We believe that these documents are basically correct. However, every fair measure of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission has been met with opposition and threats from the United States, and has been obstructed and sabotaged by Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents under US command in the prisoner of war camps south of the Demilitarized Zone. Faced with the difficulties created single-handedly by the United States, the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission and the Indian Custodial Forces have made great efforts in carrying out their tasks; however, they have consistently been unwilling to take effective measures on the key issue of how to deal with the special agent organizations in the southern prisoner of war camps, to disband the special agent organizations, eliminate special agents, and implement isolated explanations in order to maintain and implement the provisions of the "Terms of Reference." On the contrary, the commission recognized the special agents who murdered prisoners of war as so-called prisoner of war "representatives," granting them legitimate status, allowing the special agents to run rampant in the southern prisoner of war camps, threatening prisoners of war with force, disrupting explanations, and obstructing repatriation. Therefore, the explanation work on our side was only carried out for ten days, and more than 85 percent of the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war were unable to hear the explanations at all, let alone have the opportunity to exercise their right to be repatriated. We find this unsatisfactory.

The "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" endowed the commission with the right and responsibility to interpret and implement the "Terms of Reference." According to the "Terms of Reference," the commission argued that the explanation period should be extended and that the future of un-repatriated prisoners of war should be resolved by the Korean Political Conference. The commission also believed that "if the status of prisoners of war is changed by declaring them civilians or by any other means, explanation work and the steps of the political conference need to be implemented before this; these steps must be carried out to a legal end in accordance with the provisions of the above-mentioned terms (of reference). Unless both parties agree on other steps or practices regarding the status and handling of prisoners of war, any unilateral action by any relevant party will not conform to the terms of reference.” We believe that these arguments and interpretations of the commission are in line with the basic goals and provisions of the "Terms of Reference." But in fact, the commission yielded to US pressure, disregarding the firm opposition of the Korean and Chinese sides, disregarding the solemn protests of the Polish and Czechoslovak commissioners, abandoned its own arguments and interpretations, violated the steps stipulated in the "Terms of Reference," and decided to hand over the un-repatriated prisoners of war to their original detaining parties; even after the United States had clearly expressed its readiness to force Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to join the armies of Rhee and Chiang, these Korean and Chinese prisoners of war were still illegally handed over. This facilitated the implementation of the US plot to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. We cannot but express great regret over this.

III. However, it should be pointed out that the US side bears the undeniable primary responsibility for the current serious situation regarding the prisoner of war issue.

In order to achieve its evil goal of forcibly detaining a large number of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war, the United States has long been carrying out a terrorist rule of special agents in the prisoner of war camps. As early as 1951, the US side deployed a large number of Syngman Rhee and Chiang Kai-shek special agents in the prisoner of war camps in Geoje Island, Jeju Island, Bongam Island, Busan and other places, wantonly destroying the humanitarian principles of the Geneva Convention, and using cruel and inhumane violent means such as torture, beatings, tattooing, and branding to harm the lives of Korean and Chinese prisoners of war and insult their personal dignity; subsequently, it carried out illegal bloody "screenings" to obstruct the realization of their desire to be repatriated. At the same time, the US side has consistently insisted on its so-called "voluntary repatriation" and "no forced repatriation" at the armistice negotiation table, which is actually a trick to forcibly detain prisoners of war, making it impossible to resolve the prisoner of war issue for a long time and preventing the Korean armistice from being realized for a long time. It was only due to the repeated efforts of the Korean and Chinese sides and the strong pressure of just public opinion around the world, especially due to the continuous military failures of the US side on the Korean battlefield, that the US side was forced to reach an agreement with the Korean and Chinese sides on the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and finally accepted the armistice.

Although the United States signed the agreement on the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission," it still did not abandon its plot to forcibly detain prisoners of war. Only ten days after the "Terms of Reference" were signed, the Syngman Rhee group, with the connivance of the United States, abducted more than 27,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war from June 18th to 22nd, 1953. Although the US side admitted that it would do its best to recover these prisoners of war, it has not yet provided any explanation. After the prisoners of war who were not directly repatriated were handed over to the custody of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission, the US side further strengthened the special agent organizations in the southern prisoner of war camps and the terrorist control over the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war. Throughout the entire period of custody by the Indian troops, these special agents wantonly murdered and persecuted prisoners of war who had the desire to be repatriated, and tried every means to obstruct and sabotage the explanation work. The US side also influenced the Swiss and Swedish commissioners to create various difficulties within the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission. As a result, all the key provisions of the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" were undermined, and the Korean and Chinese prisoners of war's freedom to choose repatriation was therefore impossible to exercise.

In order to avoid the political conference to discuss the handling of prisoners of war, so as to further carry out its plot to forcibly detain prisoners of war, the US side unreasonably interrupted the bilateral talks on the issue of the political conference on December 12, 1953. Then, the US side unilaterally announced that the explanation work would end on December 23, 1953, and that the custody of prisoners of war by the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission should end on January 22, 1954. On January 20th and 21st, 1954, the US side finally dispatched a large number of US armed forces to cooperate with the special agents in the southern prisoner of war camps, and forcibly handed over more than 21,900 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war to the Rhee and Chiang armies to serve as cannon fodder. In this way, they finally realized their evil plot to forcibly detain Korean and Chinese prisoners of war.

Now, anyone can see that the US side arbitrarily destroys international conventions and international agreements, completely obliterates justice and humanitarian principles, and wantonly tramples on human dignity and freedom. The entire process of the so-called psychological warfare conducted by the US side on the issue of prisoners of war proves its complete bankruptcy politically and morally. If this evil policy of the US side is not severely condemned and resolutely stopped, then the special agent terror that the US side is implementing against Korean and Chinese prisoners of war today may be used against the people of any country in the world tomorrow. Therefore, the people of the world who love peace, freedom and justice should resolutely take action to stop the barbaric and brutal special agent terror policy of the US imperialists and to safeguard human freedom, justice and fairness.

IV. The provocative action of the US side in forcibly detaining more than 21,900 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war has completely destroyed the agreement on the "Terms of Reference of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" and seriously violated the provisions of Articles 51 and 52 of the Korean Armistice Agreement. This has placed new obstacles in the way of a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue. The seriousness of this action by the US side is self-evident. The Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China, adhering to its consistent policy of insisting on a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue and in order to prevent the US plot to obstruct the peaceful road in Korea from succeeding, solemnly declares that the US side bears the full responsibility for recovering and accounting to the Korean and Chinese sides at any time for the more than 21,900 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were forcibly detained this time and the more than 27,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war who were forcibly detained from June 18th to 22nd, 1953; and we reserve the right to submit this issue to the Korean Political Conference and other relevant international conferences for discussion. And no matter when the political conference is held, no matter where these prisoners of war are forcibly detained, as long as the US side does not recover them, we will not give up pursuing this crime of the US side for a single day!

V. In order to promptly arrange the convening of the Korean Political Conference to discuss the issue of prisoners of war and seek a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, the Government of the People's Republic of China and Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea successively issued statements on January 9th and 10th, 1954, advocating the immediate resumption of the bilateral talks on the issue of the Korean Political Conference, and the negotiation representatives of the Korean and Chinese sides also put forward a proposal for the liaison secretaries of both sides to meet immediately to discuss and decide on the date for the resumption of the bilateral talks. Due to this effort by the Chinese and Korean governments, and on the basis of the above-mentioned proposal by the Korean and Chinese negotiation representatives, the meeting of liaison secretaries of both sides began to be held on January 14th, 1954. However, the US side continued to adopt a delaying attitude at the meeting of liaison secretaries of both sides. It rejected the three proposals for the date of resumption of the meeting put forward by the Korean and Chinese sides, and stubbornly insisted unreasonably on holding an administrative meeting of the liaison secretaries of both sides to revise the past meeting records as a condition for resuming the bilateral talks. In this way, the US side has both obstructed the convening of the political conference in the bilateral talks and obstructed the resumption of the bilateral talks in the meeting of liaison secretaries. Therefore, the possibility of convening the Korean Political Conference has become increasingly remote.

However, in order to satisfy the ardent wishes of the Korean and Chinese people and the countries and people of the world who love peace and demand the prompt convening of the Korean Political Conference, the negotiation representatives of the Korean and Chinese sides have now been ordered to directly propose to the US negotiation representatives to resume the bilateral talks at Panmunjom on February 1st, 1954. At the same time, the Korean and Chinese sides also stated that they are prepared to consider in a cautious manner any suggestions that the US side is willing to put forward regarding the date of resumption of the meeting. Therefore, whether the bilateral talks can be resumed in the future will depend on the US side.

VI. It should be pointed out that the reason why the US side wants to delay and obstruct the convening of the Korean Political Conference is not only to evade the discussion of the issue of prisoners of war, but more importantly because some warmongers in the US ruling group oppose a peaceful settlement of the Korean issue, and try to maintain the unstable state of the Korean armistice and maintain the tense situation in the Far East and Asia, so as to facilitate the continued implementation of their policy of expanding armaments and preparing for war, so as to seek the greatest profits for the US monopoly capital groups. The war policy of the United States in Asia of actively arming Japan, stepping up military aggression against Southeast Asia, organizing aggressive blocs and expanding the network of military bases also fully reflects the evil attempts of these warmongers. The countries and people of Asia and the world who love peace must be vigilant against this major aggressive conspiracy of the United States, resolutely oppose the US delaying and obstructing policy, and promote the prompt convening of the Korean Political Conference, so that it is possible to move the situation in the Far East and Asia towards further relaxation. The Government and people of the People's Republic of China are willing to join hands with the countries and people of the world who love peace to fight against the war policy of the United States.

VII. The peaceful settlement of the Korean issue has become increasingly difficult due to the US action of forcibly detaining prisoners of war and the policy of obstructing the convening of the political conference. The United Nations, which is responsible for maintaining international peace and security, should immediately promote the resumption of the Eighth United Nations General Assembly to review the serious situation in Korea if it is not willing to completely abandon itself. Now, the US government is doing its utmost to obstruct this. We believe that all countries with peaceful aspirations in the United Nations should resolutely oppose this obstruction conspiracy of the United States and promote the rapid resumption of the United Nations General Assembly. We once again propose, when the United Nations General Assembly discusses the Korean issue, the Government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the Central People's Government of the People'

　　我外交部部长周恩来发表声明
　　强硬抗议美方强迫扣留朝中战俘
    【新华社二十九日讯】中华人民共和国中央人民政府外交部部长周恩来关于联合国军方面强迫扣留朝中战俘的声明。全文如下：
    一、一九五四年一月二十日和二十一日，美国方面公然破坏朝鲜停战缔约双方关于战俘问题的协议，使用武力和以武力威胁，将二万一千九百余名朝中战俘分别押解到南朝鲜的浦项和群山及台湾的基隆，强迫他们参加李承晚的和蒋介石的军队，完全剥夺了他们申请回家过和平生活的自由和权利。美国方面这一强迫扣留朝中战俘的行动引起了中朝人民极大的愤怒。中华人民共和国中央人民政府授权本人对此提出最强硬的抗议。
    二、中立国遣返委员会在其看管和处理战俘工作过程中，曾经根据“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的规定，公布了“给全体战俘的公告”和“关于工作情况的声明”，制定了“解释和访问工作细则”，发表了“中立国遣返委员会临时报告”。我们认为，这些文件基本上都是正确的。但是，中立国遣返委员会的每一个公正措施都受到了美国方面的反对和威胁，并受到了在非军事区南部战俘营中美方所指挥的李承晚、蒋介石特务分子的阻挠和破坏。面对着美方所一手制造的这种困难，中立国遣返委员会和印度看管部队在执行其任务时，曾经作了很大的努力；可是他们在如何对待南部战俘营中特务组织的关键问题上，却一直不愿采取有效措施，打散特务组织，清除特务分子，实行隔离解释，以维护和实施“职权范围”的规定。相反地，委员会却承认凶杀战俘的特务为所谓战俘“代表”，给予他们以合法的地位，致使特务得以在南部战俘营中横行无忌地以武力威胁战俘，破坏解释，阻挠遣返。因此，我方对战俘的解释工作仅仅进行了十天，百分之八十五以上的朝中战俘根本未能听取解释，更无从获得机会行使其被遣返的权利。对此，我们认为是不能满意的。
   “中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”赋予了委员会以解释和实施“职权范围”的权利和责任。根据“职权范围”，委员会主张，解释期限应予延长，未遣返战俘的前途问题应交朝鲜政治会议解决。委员会并认为：“若用宣布成为平民身份，或者用任何其他方式的处理来改变战俘的身份，都需要在此之前实施解释工作和政治会议的步骤；这种步骤须根据上述职权（范围）的规定进行到合法的终局。除非双方关于战俘身份与处理商定其他步骤或做法，任何有关方面的任何片面行动将不符合于该职权范围。”我们认为，委员会的这些主张和解释是符合于“职权范围”的基本目标和条文规定的。但在事实上，委员会却又屈服于美方压力之下，不顾朝中方面的坚决反对，不顾波兰和捷克斯洛伐克委员的严正抗议，抛弃自己的主张和解释，违反“职权范围”规定的步骤，决定把未遣返战俘交还他们的原拘留各方；甚至在美方已明白表示准备强迫朝中战俘参加李、蒋军队之后，这批朝中战俘仍被违法交还。这就使美方强迫扣留朝中战俘的阴谋的实施获得了便利。我们对此不能不表示很大的遗憾。
    三、但是，应当指出，对于战俘问题目前严重情况的造成，美国方面是负有无可推卸的主要责任的。
    美国方面为了达到其强迫扣留大批朝中战俘的罪恶目的，很久以来就在战俘营中实行特务的恐怖统治。早在一九五一年，美方即在巨济岛、济州岛、蜂岩岛、釜山等地战俘营中布置了大批李承晚、蒋介石特务分子，肆意破坏日内瓦公约的人道原则，用虐杀、毒打、刺字、文身等惨无人道的暴力手段，来伤害朝中战俘的生命和侮辱他们的人格尊严；其后，更进行非法的血腥“甄别”，来阻挠他们要求遣返愿望的实现。同时，美方在停战谈判桌上一直坚持其所谓“自愿遣返”和“不得强迫遣返”实即强迫扣留战俘的诡计，使战俘问题长期不得解决，朝鲜停战长期不能实现。只是由于朝中方面的多次努力和全世界公正舆论的强大压力，特别是由于美方在朝鲜战场上连续的军事失败，美方才被迫与朝中方面达成了“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的协议，并在最后接受了停战。
    美国方面虽然在“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的协议上签了字，但仍不放弃其强迫扣留战俘的阴谋。“职权范围”签订后不过十天，李承晚集团就在美方的纵容之下于一九五三年六月十八日至二十二日劫夺了朝中战俘二万七千余名。美方虽然承认要尽力追回这些战俘，但迄今为止还没有作出任何交代。在未予直接遣返的战俘移交给中立国遣返委员会看管之后，美方更加强化了南部战俘营中的特务组织和对朝中战俘的恐怖控制。在印度部队看管的整个期间，这些特务分子肆意谋杀和迫害具有遣返愿望的战俘，千方百计地阻挠和破坏解释工作。美方并影响瑞士、瑞典委员在中立国遣返委员会内部制造种种困难。结果遂使“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的一切关键性规定都遭受破坏，朝中战俘选择遣返的自由权利因之也无从行使。
    美方为了躲开讨论战俘处理问题的政治会议，以便进一步遂行其强迫扣留战俘的阴谋，于一九五三年十二月十二日又无理中断了关于政治会议问题的双方会谈。接着，美方就片面宣布，解释工作于一九五三年十二月二十三日结束，中立国遣返委员会对战俘的看管应于一九五四年一月二十二日终止。到了一九五四年一月二十日和二十一日，美方终于调派了大批美国武装部队配合南部战俘营中的特务分子，将二万一千九百余名朝中战俘分别押交李、蒋军队去充当炮灰。这样，它们就最后实现了强迫扣留朝中战俘的罪恶阴谋。
    现在，任何人都可以看清，美国方面对于国际公约和国际协议是随意破坏的，对于公理正义和人道原则是根本抹煞的，对于人类尊严和自由是横加蹂躏的。美方在战俘问题上进行的所谓心理战的全部过程，证明了它在政治上和道义上的完全破产。如果美方的这种罪恶政策不受到严厉的谴责和坚决的制止，那么，美方今天对朝中战俘实施的特务恐怖，明天就可能被用来对付全世界任何一个国家的人民。因此，全世界爱好和平、自由和正义的人民应该坚决地行动起来，为制止美帝国主义者野蛮残暴的特务恐怖政策，为保障人类的自由、公理和正义而斗争。
    四、美国方面强迫扣留二万一千九百余名朝中战俘的挑衅行动，彻底地破坏了“中立国遣返委员会的职权范围”的协议，并严重地违反了朝鲜停战协定第五十一款和第五十二款的规定。这就在通向和平解决朝鲜问题的道路上布置了新的障碍。美国方面这一行动的严重性质，是不言而喻的。中华人民共和国中央人民政府本着坚持和平解决朝鲜问题的一贯政策，并为了不许美方这种阻塞朝鲜和平道路的阴谋得逞，特郑重声明：美国方面对于这次被强迫扣留的二万一千九百余名朝中战俘和一九五三年六月十八日至二十二日被强迫扣留的二万七千余名朝中战俘在任何时候都负有全部追回、并向朝中方面提出交代的责任；我们并保留把这个问题提交朝鲜政治会议及其他有关国际会议讨论的权利。并且不论政治会议何时召开，不论这些战俘被强迫扣留在什么地方，只要美方一天不把他们追回，我们就一天不放弃对美方这种罪行进行追究！
    五、为了迅速安排朝鲜政治会议的召开，来讨论战俘问题及谋求朝鲜问题的和平解决，中华人民共和国中央人民政府和朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府曾于一九五四年一月九日和十日先后发表声明，主张立即恢复关于朝鲜政治会议问题的双方会谈，朝中方面的谈判代表并提出了双方联络秘书立即进行会晤来商定恢复双方会谈日期的建议。由于中朝政府的这一努力，并在朝中谈判代表上述建议的基础之上，双方联络秘书会议才于一九五四年一月十四日开始举行。但是，美方在双方联络秘书会议中仍然继续采取拖延态度。它拒绝了朝中方面三次提出的复会日期的建议，而始终无理地坚持举行双方联络秘书的行政性会议来修改过去会谈纪录，以作为恢复双方会谈的条件。这样，美方既在双方会谈中阻挠了政治会议的召开，又在联络秘书会议中阻挠了双方会谈的恢复，因之朝鲜政治会议召开的可能就愈益遥远。
    但是，为了满足朝中人民及全世界爱好和平的国家和人民要求迅速召开朝鲜政治会议的殷切愿望，朝中方面的谈判代表现已奉命向美方谈判代表直接提出建议，要求于一九五四年二月一日在板门店恢复双方会谈，同时，朝中方面并声明准备以慎重的态度来考虑美方愿意提出的任何关于复会日期的建议。因此，今后双方会谈能否恢复，将取决于美方。
    六、应该指出，美方之所以要拖延和阻挠朝鲜政治会议的召开，不仅是为了要逃避关于战俘问题的讨论，更主要的还是由于美国统治集团中某些好战分子反对和平解决朝鲜问题，力图保持朝鲜停战的不稳定状态，保持远东和亚洲的紧张局势，以利于他们扩军备战政策的继续推行，好为美国垄断资本集团谋取最大利润。美国在亚洲所进行的积极武装日本、加紧对东南亚的军事侵略、组织侵略集团和扩大军事基地网的战争政策，也充分反映了这些好战分子的罪恶企图。亚洲和全世界爱好和平的国家和人民，对于美国这种侵略性的重大阴谋，必须提高警惕，坚决反对美方的拖延和阻挠政策，来促使朝鲜政治会议迅速召开，这样才有可能使远东和亚洲局势走向进一步的缓和。中华人民共和国政府和人民愿意与世界爱好和平的国家和人民一道，共同为反对美国的战争政策而奋斗。
    七、朝鲜问题的和平解决已因美方强迫扣留战俘的行动和阻挠政治会议召开的政策而愈趋困难，负有维护国际和平与安全之责的联合国，如果还不甘于完全自暴自弃的话，就应该立即促使第八届联合国大会复会，以审查朝鲜的严重局势。现在，美国政府正竭力对此加以阻挠。我们认为，联合国中一切具有和平愿望的国家，应该坚决反对美方这种阻挠阴谋，并推动联合国大会的迅速复会。我们再一次提出，在联合国大会讨论朝鲜问题时，朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国中央人民政府有权利派遣自己的代表参加这一讨论。
    八、鉴于美国在朝鲜、亚洲以及世界各地推行侵略政策所造成的国际紧张局势，召开苏联、美国、英国、法国和中华人民共和国的五大国会议，来对当前迫切的国际问题加以审查和解决，今天是更加必要了。因此，中华人民共和国中央人民政府完全支持苏联莫洛托夫外长一九五四年一月二十六日在柏林会议中所提出的“关于缓和国际紧张局势的措施和召开法国、英国、美国、苏联和中华人民共和国的外长会议”的建议。事情非常明显：一切爱好和平的人民都希望召开这样的大国会议。为了朝着缓和国际紧张局势、解除新战争威胁及巩固国际和平与安全的方向前进，人民的这种希望是不容漠视的。
                一九五四年一月二十九日于北京
