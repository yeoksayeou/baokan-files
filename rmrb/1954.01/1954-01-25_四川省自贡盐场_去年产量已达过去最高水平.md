The Sichuan Zigong Salt Field comprehensively overfulfilled the 1953 national plan: last year's annual output reached the highest level in the past; the salt quality (sodium chloride content) exceeded the standards set by the central government; state-owned and jointly owned public-private salt factories completed 111.49% of the profit delivery plan, and costs were reduced by 5.5% compared with 1952. The transportation and sales plan and tax revenue plan were also overfulfilled. The comprehensive completion of last year's production plan by the Zigong Salt Field not only accumulated a large amount of funds for the country, but also provided a large quantity of high-quality and low-priced edible salt to the people in various parts of Southwest China and some areas in Northwest and Central South China, especially the minority people. From January to August last year, the amount of edible salt transported from the Zigong Salt Field to minority areas in Guizhou was more than 10 million jin higher than the previous year. The various by-products produced by the Zigong Salt Field last year also supplied a large amount of needs for the chemical industry.

In completing last year's annual production plan, the Zigong Salt Field workers solved many key issues related to increasing salt production and improving quality. From January to November last year, workers put forward more than 2,000 rationalization proposals, of which 879 were adopted. For example, after brine extraction worker Xu Daxing improved the "cylinder brine extractor," one well can increase the country's wealth by more than 180 million yuan per year. Currently, 26 units in Zigong City have recommended the use of this "cylinder brine extractor." The "hard slag salt-making method" created by Shuangli stove workers has a significant effect on increasing salt production, improving quality, and reducing coal consumption. This method has been promoted in more than 50 units in Zigong City.

    四川省自贡盐场
    去年产量已达过去最高水平
    四川省自贡盐场已全面地超额完成了一九五三年国家计划：去年全年产量已达过去最高水平；盐质（含氯化钠量）已超过中央规定的标准；国营、公私合营盐厂上缴利润计划完成了百分之一百十一点四九，成本比一九五二年降低了百分之五点五，运销计划及税收计划也都超额完成。自贡盐场全面地完成了去年生产计划，不仅为国家积累了大量资金，而且使西南各地和西北、中南等部分地区的广大人民、特别是少数民族人民，获得大量质好价廉的食盐。去年一月至八月，从自贡盐场运往贵州少数民族地区的食盐，就比前年多一千多万斤。自贡盐场去年所产的多种副产品，也大量地供应了化学工业的需要。
    自贡盐场职工在完成去年全年生产计划中，解决了很多有关增加盐的产量和提高质量方面的关键问题。自去年一月至十一月，职工们共提出合理化建议二千多件，其中已被采纳了八百七十九件。如汲卤工人徐大兴改进了“筒内汲卤器”后，一个井每年可为国家增加财富一亿八千多万元。现在自贡市已有二十六个单位推荐使用这种“筒内汲卤器”。双立灶工人创造的“硬渣制盐法”，对提高盐的产量、质量和降低煤耗都有很大作用。这种方法已在自贡市五十多个单位中推行。
