    One Physics Teacher for Eight Classes
    Xu Gengui, a student from the Shijiazhuang Workers and Peasants Accelerated Secondary School in Hebei Province, writes: Since our school was established at the end of 1951, the problem of insufficient teachers has not been resolved. Some classes are either taught by temporary substitutes or combined, and sometimes they are even turned into "self-study" when there are no teachers, with intensive teaching carried out when teachers are available. For example, our school has eight classes with physics, four of which are science and engineering classes with more physics class hours, but there is only one teacher who graduated from a normal college in 1952 to teach physics. This semester, we are learning high school physics, but the teachers are still not fully staffed, and we are still having combined classes. Our school is directly led by the Hebei Provincial Department of Education, but the Department of Education has never come to inspect the work, nor has it planned to solve this problem. Our physics teacher teaches sixteen hours a week, while the Shijiazhuang Normal School has three physics teachers, some of whom only teach nine hours a week. We have repeatedly raised our concerns to the Municipal Bureau of Culture and Education, requesting a reasonable allocation of physics teachers. Initially, the Bureau of Culture and Education only assigned a teacher who had never taught physics, and as a result, the students could not understand his explanations. After more than twenty days, the work had to be "restarted." Finally, after our repeated requests, the Bureau of Culture and Education transferred a teacher from the normal school to teach temporarily, but it was still a combined large class, which affected the teaching effectiveness. How can we complete our accelerated learning tasks if this continues?

    八个班只有一位物理教师
    河北石家庄工农速成中学学生许根贵来信：我校自一九五一年底成立以来，教师不足的问题一直未能解决。有些课不是临时找人代课就是合班上课，甚至有时没有老师就改为“自习”，等到有了老师时就进行突击。如我校有八个班有物理课，其中有四个班是理工班，物理课的学时又多，而担任物理教学的只有一位一九五二年从师范专科学校毕业的教师。这学期我们学高中物理了，教师仍未配齐，还是合班上课。我校是属河北省教育厅直接领导的，但教育厅从来没有来检查过工作，也没有有计划地来解决这个问题。我校物理老师每周教十六小时，石家庄市师范学校有物理教师三人，有的每周只教课九小时。我们曾向市文教局几次提意见要求合理调配物理教师。开始，文教局只调给一个没有教过物理的教师，结果同学都听不懂他的讲解，上了二十多天又重新“反工”。最后经我们再三要求，文教局才从师范学校中调了一位老师来临时代课，还是合班上大课，影响了教学效果。这样下去，我们的速成学习任务怎能完成？
