The Haibei Tibetan Autonomous Region in Qinghai Province is equivalent to a special district level. It is located in the northeastern part of Qinghai Lake, bounded by the Qilian Mountains to the north and east, bordering the Hexi Corridor of Gansu Province. It is adjacent to the agricultural areas of Qinghai Province to the southeast and neighbors the Haixi Mongol, Tibetan, and Kazakh Autonomous Region (soon to be established) to the west. The autonomous region governs Qilian, Gangcha, and Haiyan counties, as well as the Hui Autonomous Region of Menyuan County, covering an area of approximately 70,000 square kilometers, bisected by the Hao Men River. Except for the Hui Autonomous Region of Menyuan County, which is a semi-agricultural and semi-pastoral area, the entire region is a pastoral area primarily engaged in animal husbandry. It has a population of about 70,000 people from six ethnic groups: Tibetan, Mongolian, Hui, Han, Tu, and Salar, of which the Tibetan population is about 24,000. The entire region has more than 595,000 livestock, producing more than 1.7 million catties of wool annually. The Menyuan horse, known for its sturdiness and speed, originates from here. In addition, it also produces valuable products and medicinal materials such as lynx, deer antler, musk, and rhubarb. Mineral resources include coal, iron, copper, and borax. There is also a vast virgin forest area, rich in construction timber such as pine, cypress, and birch.

    Before liberation, due to the oppression and plunder by the Kuomintang bandits in the Haibei Tibetan area, there were many disputes between and within ethnic groups; agricultural and pastoral production declined, and the living standards of all ethnic groups deteriorated. In 1949, after Communist Party and People's Government cadres entered the Haibei Tibetan area, they vigorously publicized and implemented various policies of ethnic equality, unity, and production development. All ethnic groups eagerly demanded the resolution of disputes and the stabilization of social order. Over the past four years, more than 700 historical disputes have been mediated throughout the region, and 17 county and district-level governments have been established, including one county-level and one district-level Hui autonomous region, and three district-level Mongolian autonomous regions. Township-level governments have been established in agricultural areas, and leading figures with connections to the masses participate in the leadership work in governments at all levels. The entire region has a total of 302 ethnic minority cadres. Ethnic minority cadres in Qilian County account for more than 44 percent of the total number of cadres in the county, laying the foundation for the development of various construction undertakings in the autonomous region.

    The Communist Party and the People's Government resolutely implemented the policy of "no distribution, no struggle, no class division" and a fair and reasonable trade policy in pastoral areas, and distributed various loans and relief funds totaling nearly 2.5 billion yuan to help poor herdsmen overcome difficulties in production and life. Herdsmen also established various livestock protection organizations and improved breeding management methods, which led to the development of animal husbandry production. Over the past four years, the number of livestock in the region has increased by an average of 30 percent. The autonomous region also has two state-owned farms, which have played a significant role in the restoration and development of animal husbandry production. In agricultural areas, crop yields have exceeded pre-liberation levels, and about 70 percent of farmers have joined mutual aid teams. People of all ethnic groups in the region actively participate in sideline production, which has helped the development of animal husbandry and agricultural production and improved their lives. Last year, the sideline income of all ethnic groups reached about 6 billion yuan. At present, three state-owned trading organizations, six mobile trading teams, four cooperative county federations, and fifteen grassroots supply and marketing cooperatives have been established in the region, ensuring that the autonomous region's local products and specialties are basically marketable, the price difference between agricultural, pastoral, and industrial products is reduced, and the means of production and living for all ethnic groups are fully supplied, improving their living standards.

    The autonomous region's cultural, educational, and health undertakings have also developed accordingly. The number of primary schools in the region has increased to 56, with nearly 3,000 students. All counties have established health institutions and regularly organize mobile medical teams to go deep into pastoral and agricultural areas to prevent and treat diseases. (Xinhua News Agency)

    青海省海北藏族自治区介绍
    青海省海北藏族自治区相当于专区级，位于青海湖的东北部，北部和东部以祁连山为界，和甘肃省河西走廊相接，东南和青海省的农业区毗连，西面与即将成立的海西蒙、藏、哈族自治区为邻。自治区辖祁连、刚察、海晏三县和亹源县回族自治区，面积约七万平方公里，浩亹河横贯其中。全区除亹源县回族自治区为半农半牧区外，都是以畜牧业生产为主的牧业区，共有藏、蒙、回、汉、土、撒拉等六个民族约七万人，其中藏族约有二万四千多人。全区共有各种牲畜五十九万五千多头，年产羊毛一百七十多万斤，向以矫健善走闻名的亹源马就出在这里。此外还出产猞猁、鹿茸、麝香、大黄等名贵产品和药材。矿藏有煤、铁、铜和硼砂等。这里还有广大的原始森林区，盛产松、柏、桦等建筑用材。
    解放前，海北藏区由于国民党匪帮的压迫和掠夺，民族间和民族内部存在许多纠纷；农业、牧业生产日趋衰落，各族人民生活日益贫困。一九四九年，共产党和人民政府的干部先后进入海北藏区后，大力宣传和贯彻了民族平等团结和发展生产的各项政策，各族人民迫切要求调解纠纷，安定社会秩序。四年来，全区共调解各种历史纠纷七百多件，并建立了县、区级政权十七个，其中包括一个县级和一个区级的回族自治区，三个区级的蒙族自治区。农业区普遍建立了乡级政权，各级政权中都有与群众有联系的领袖人物参加领导工作。全区共有民族干部三百零二人。祁连县的民族干部已占全县干部总数的百分之四十四以上，为发展自治区的各项建设事业奠定了基础。
    共产党和人民政府在牧业区坚决执行了“不分不斗、不划阶级”的政策和公平合理的贸易政策，发放了各种贷款和救济款近二十五亿元，帮助贫苦牧民克服生产和生活的困难，牧民们并建立了各种保畜组织，改进饲养管理方法，使畜牧业生产有了发展。四年来，全区各种牲畜平均增殖了百分之三十。自治区还有两处国营牧场，对恢复和发展畜牧业生产也起了很大作用。在农业地区，农作物产量超过了解放以前的水平，有百分之七十左右的农民参加了互助组。全区各族人民都积极参加副业生产，帮助了畜牧业和农业生产的发展，改善了生活。去年各族人民的副业收入就达到六十亿元左右。现在，全区已建立起三处国营贸易机构，六个流动贸易小组，四个合作社县联合社和十五个基层供销合作社，使自治区的土产品、特产品基本上达到畅销，农业品、牧业产品和工业产品之间的差价缩小，各族人民的生产资料和生活资料得到了充分供应，提高了生活水平。
    自治区的文教卫生事业也有了相应的发展。全区的小学校已增加到五十六所，学生近三千人。各县都建立了卫生机构，并经常组织巡回医疗小组，深入牧业区和农业区防治疾病。（新华社）
