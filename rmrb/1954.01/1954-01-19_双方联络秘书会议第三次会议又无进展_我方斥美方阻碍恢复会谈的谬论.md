Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, 18th—The delegation of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and the People's Republic of China participating in the talks between both sides on the issue of the political conference issued the following communique:

    The third meeting of liaison secretaries between the two sides was held on January 18th. Because the U.S. side insisted on its unreasonable demand of revising the past meeting records as a condition for resuming the talks, today's meeting still achieved no progress.

    Our side's secretary pointed out at the meeting that our side's position of advocating unconditional resumption of the meeting is a truly realistic position that is conducive to the early resumption of talks between the two sides. In order to resume the talks immediately, our side suggested specific dates for resumption at the past two meetings, but the other side insisted on discussing the conditions for resumption and refused to agree with our side on a date for resumption, so that the talks between the two sides failed to resume on January 16th as suggested by our side. Our side cannot help but express regret over this.

    Our side's secretary further emphasized: In order to insist on revising the past meeting records as a condition for resumption, the other side actually said in its speech at the last meeting that our side had brought "extraneous," "irrelevant," "unacceptable," "obstructive," and "destructive" matters into the record during the past talks. This is completely unfounded. What our side said in the past talks was true and in accordance with the facts. It was the other side that brought extraneous, irrelevant, unacceptable, obstructive, and destructive matters into the record during the past talks. For example, at the twelfth meeting of the talks between the two sides on November 14, 1953, the two sides agreed to issue a joint communique to announce the agreement on a common agenda and discussion methods, but the other side did not issue this joint communique in accordance with the agreement between the two sides. Isn't this kind of practice by the other side obstructive and destructive? Furthermore, at the meeting on November 19, the other side groundlessly insulted the Asian neutral countries suggested by our side to be invited to participate in the political conference, and compared the Chiang Kai-shek bandit gang in Taiwan with these Asian neutral countries. At the meeting on November 20, the other side openly suggested going to Madrid, under the rule of the fascist Franco, to hold a political conference. Isn't this bringing extraneous, irrelevant, unacceptable, obstructive, and destructive matters into the record? Furthermore, at the meeting on November 24, the other side babbled about the open-air toilets in Panmunjom and suggested that representatives of all countries participating in the political conference bring telescopes so that they could watch the stars in Panmunjom. At the same meeting, the other side wasted nearly half an hour talking about the origin of Thanksgiving. At the meeting on November 28, the representative of the other side boasted about how close Roosevelt's hometown was to his home. May I ask what all this has to do with the content of the talks between the two sides? And there are countless examples like this. Even so, our side still believes that the resumption of talks between the two sides and the convening of a political conference are very important issues, and the disputes between the two sides in the past talks should not become an obstacle to the rapid resumption of talks between the two sides.

    Our side's secretary also pointed out: In the past armistice negotiations and talks between the two sides, the two sides have always kept their own records of the meeting and there is no joint record. Therefore, there was never a need in the past and there is still no need now to check the meeting records to make them a joint record. Moreover, even if there is a jointly agreed record, such as the joint communique that the two sides have already agreed on, the U.S. side arbitrarily refuses to issue it. From this, it can be seen that the other side's sudden request to revise the past meeting records now has no other purpose than to attempt to re-ignite the past disputes between the two sides in order to obstruct the rapid resumption of talks between the two sides. If the other side truly intends to quickly resume the talks between the two sides, it should no longer insist on this so-called condition for resumption that obstructs the resumption of talks between the two sides. Our side firmly advocates the immediate resumption of talks between the two sides, and suggests January 20th as the date for resumption. Our side is willing to listen to the other side's opinions.

    In his speech, the U.S. secretary, while claiming to be working hard for the convening of a political conference, still insisted on revising the past meeting records as a condition for resumption and continued to refuse to agree with our side on a date for resumption.

    Therefore, our side's secretary pointed out: If the other side is truly working hard for the convening of a political conference, it should show it through actions. But the other side opposes the immediate resumption of talks between the two sides, and tries to revive the past disputes to delay the resumption of talks between the two sides. How can people believe that the other side has the sincerity to convene a political conference as soon as possible?

    Finally, in view of the fact that the other side is obviously not yet prepared to resume talks between the two sides, our side suggested adjourning the meeting until January 20th so that the other side would have enough time to reconsider its position. The U.S. side agreed to adjourn the meeting.

### 双方联络秘书会议第三次会议又无进展  我方斥美方阻碍恢复会谈的谬论

    双方联络秘书会议第三次会议又无进展
    我方斥美方阻碍恢复会谈的谬论
    【新华社开城十八日电】朝鲜民主主义人民共和国与中华人民共和国参加关于政治会议问题双方会谈的代表团发表公报如下：
    一月十八日，双方联络秘书会议举行第三次会议。由于美方坚持其以修改过去会议记录为恢复双方会谈的条件的无理主张，今日会议仍无进展。
    我方秘书在会上指出，我方主张无条件复会的立场，是一个真正现实的并有利于早日恢复双方会谈的立场。我方为了立即恢复会谈，在过去两次会上建议了具体的复会日期，但是对方坚持讨论复会的条件并拒绝与我方商定复会日期，以致双方会谈未能按我方的建议在一月十六日恢复，我方对此不能不表示遗憾。
    我方秘书又强调指出：对方为了坚持以修改过去会议记录作为复会的条件，竟在上次会议的发言中说我方在过去的会谈中把“题外的”、“不相干的”、“不能接受的”、“障碍性的”和“破坏性的”事项带进了记录，这是毫无根据的。我方在过去会谈中所说的话都是真实的，符合于事实的，在过去的会谈中把题外的、不相干的、不能接受的、障碍性的和破坏性的事项带进记录的正是对方。例如在一九五三年十一月十四日双方会谈的第十二次会议上，双方协议发表联合公报以公布关于共同议程和讨论方法的协议，但是对方却没有按照双方的协议发表这一联合公报，对方这种做法难道不是障碍性的和破坏性的吗？又如在十一月十九日的会议上，对方无端地对我方建议邀请参加政治会议的亚洲中立国家进行侮辱，把台湾的蒋介石匪帮与这些亚洲中立国家相提并论。在十一月二十日的会议上，对方又公然建议到法西斯佛朗哥统治下的马德里去举行政治会议，这难道不是把题外的、不相干的、不能接受的、障碍性的和破坏性的事项带进了记录吗？再如在十一月二十四日的会议上，对方又胡扯什么板门店的露天厕所，并建议参加政治会议的各国代表随带望远镜，以便在板门店观看星象。在同一次会议上，对方又浪费了近半小时的时间长谈感恩节的由来。在十一月二十八日的会议上，对方代表又夸耀罗斯福的故乡与他的家如何邻近。试问这一切与双方会谈的内容究竟有什么相干？而诸如此类的例子，不胜枚举。虽然如此，我方仍然认为恢复双方会谈和召开政治会议是非常重大的问题，双方在过去会谈中的争论不应成为迅速恢复双方会谈的障碍。
    我方秘书又指出：在过去的停战谈判及双方会谈中，双方一直都各自保持会议的记录而并无共同记录，因此过去从无必要现在亦仍无必要对会议记录进行检查使之成为共同记录，而且即使有了共同协议的记载，例如双方已经协议的联合公报，美方也任意不予发表。由此可见，现在对方忽然要求修改过去的会议记录，这除了企图重新引起双方过去的争论以阻碍双方会谈的迅速恢复外，不能有任何其他的目的。如果对方真正有意迅速恢复双方会谈，就不应该再坚持这种阻碍双方会谈恢复的所谓复会条件。我方坚决主张立即恢复双方会谈，并建议一月二十日为复会日期，我方愿意听取对方的意见。
    美方秘书在发言中虽自称为召开政治会议而努力，却仍坚持以修改过去的会议记录为复会的条件，并继续拒绝与我方商定复会的日期。
    我方秘书因此指出：对方如果真正努力于政治会议的召开，即应以行动来表现。但对方反对立即恢复双方会谈，却力图恢复过去的争论以拖延双方会谈的恢复，如何能令人相信对方有早日召开政治会议的诚意？
    最后，我方鉴于对方显然还不准备恢复双方会谈，因此建议休会至一月二十日，以便对方有足够的时间重新考虑其立场，美方同意休会。
