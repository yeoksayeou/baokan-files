Ambassador Subek's Eulogy:

Comrade Vice Chairman:

It is a high honor for me to present to you the credentials from the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic appointing me as the Ambassador of the Hungarian People's Republic to the People's Republic of China.

The great Chinese people, under the leadership of the Communist Party and with the support of the friendship of the Soviet Union, have achieved a victory of world-historic significance in the struggle against imperialist aggressors and domestic and international reactionaries. This victory has made it possible for the People's Republic of China to embark on the road to prosperity. Close and friendly ties have been established between the Hungarian people, liberated by the Soviet Union, and the Chinese people. These ties ensure the realization of the mutual interests of our two peoples.

The Hungarian people are watching with warm sympathy the peaceful and creative labor of the Chinese people in transforming the country. The start of the first five-year plan, the achievements in national industrialization, the improvement of agricultural production to a higher level, and the gradual improvement of the living standards of the working people – all these prove that fundamental social and economic changes are taking place in the People's Republic of China.

Comrade Vice Chairman, please allow me, in my personal capacity, to express my sincere admiration to the Chinese people for the outstanding creative labor that has been victoriously achieved in the past four years and which has historical significance for the future of the Chinese people. The entire Hungarian people express deep respect and gratitude for the heroic struggle of the Chinese People's Volunteers in supporting the repulsion of aggressive acts aimed at undermining peace in Korea and the entire Far East. Our people are convinced that the efforts of the Chinese people to defend peace greatly contribute to ensuring world peace.

At the time of presenting my credentials, I am full of determination to develop and deepen the existing friendly relations between our two peoples, and I will do my best. I hope that as the Ambassador of the Hungarian People's Republic, my work will further promote the fruitful cooperation between our two peoples and the strengthening of the peace camp led by the Soviet Union.

In carrying out the tasks based on my mission and the mutual interests of our two peoples, I ask for your support and the support of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China. I am confident that I will receive your sincere help and support, and that of the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China.

On behalf of the Hungarian people, the government of my country, and in my own name, I wish the friendly Chinese people and the Central People's Government of the People's Republic of China further success in accomplishing their great tasks, and in creating a happier and better future for the Chinese people.

I believe that the friendship and solidarity between our two peoples is unbreakable, and that our two countries will continue to demonstrate the most friendly cooperation in achieving the tasks facing them in the future.

Vice Chairman Zhu De's Reply:

Comrade Ambassador:

I am very pleased to accept the credentials of the Presidium of the Hungarian People's Republic that you have presented, and I sincerely thank you for your congratulations.

The friendly cooperative relations between the People's Republic of China and the Hungarian People's Republic have developed significantly over the past four years. This increasingly close friendly cooperative relationship is not only conducive to the economic and cultural prosperity of our two countries and to further enhancing the friendship between the two peoples, but also contributes to the consolidation of the peace, democracy, and socialist camp headed by the great Soviet Union.

Under the leadership of the Hungarian Working People's Party and Comrade Rákosi, the Hungarian people are engaged in the peaceful construction of their motherland with great enthusiasm and have continuously achieved brilliant successes. These achievements have always been deeply cared for and praised by the Chinese people.

Comrade Ambassador, I warmly welcome you to be appointed as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of the Hungarian People's Republic to the People'
