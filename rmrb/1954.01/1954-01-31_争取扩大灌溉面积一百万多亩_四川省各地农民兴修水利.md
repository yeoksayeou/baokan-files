　　Strive to Expand Irrigated Area by More Than One Million Mu
　　Farmers in Various Parts of Sichuan Province Build Water Conservancy Projects
    Farmers in various parts of Sichuan Province are building water conservancy projects, striving to expand the irrigated area by more than one million mu. It is estimated that the completion of this water conservancy project will increase grain production by nearly 100 million jin. At present, the annual repair of the famous Dujiangyan water conservancy project, the first stage (external river annual repair) is nearing completion, and the second stage (internal river annual repair) can also be completed in April. More than 10,000 farmers in Peng County and Guanghan area are repairing the official canal embankment. This project can be completed by the end of March, which will expand the irrigated area by 190,000 mu. It is estimated that rice production can be increased by about 9.5 million jin per year.
    According to surveys, the potential of existing water conservancy equipment in Sichuan Province is very large. To this end, this year, in addition to building new ponds and weirs, farmers in various parts of Sichuan Province are paying special attention to repairing existing ponds and weirs and strengthening water management to give full play to the utilization rate of existing water conservancy equipment. For example, if one-third of the original ponds and weirs are repaired this year, coupled with the implementation of rational water use, it may be possible to expand the irrigated area by more than 920,000 mu. Farmers in various places have a high enthusiasm for labor in repairing ponds and weirs. Qin Huixiong, a farmer in Tongshan Township, Zhongjiang County, took the lead in jumping into the icy river to reinforce the leaking river weir, encouraging the farmers in the township to repair twelve river weirs in one day. Farmers in Sanhe Township, Shehong County, carried out labor exchange and mutual assistance in repairing old ponds, and repaired four old ponds in more than ten days, expanding the irrigated area. Farmers in the Zhulihuo Weir area implemented a "rotational irrigation system" and "shallow water irrigation," which expanded the irrigation area to 180,000 mu.

　　争取扩大灌溉面积一百万多亩
　　四川省各地农民兴修水利
    四川省各地农民正在兴修水利，为争取扩大一百万多亩的灌溉面积而努力。据估计，这次水利工程的完工，将可增产近一亿斤粮食。目前，著名的水利工程都江堰的岁修，第一阶段（外江岁修）已接近完工，第二阶段（内江岁修）在四月份也可以完成。彭县、广汉一带一万多农民正在整修官渠堰，这一工程在三月底可结束，将扩大十九万亩的灌溉面积。估计每年可增产大米九百五十万斤左右。
    据调查，四川省现有水利设备的潜在力很大。为此，今年四川省各地农民除新修塘堰外，特别注意整修原有塘堰、加强用水管理，以充分发挥现有水利设备的利用率。如今年做到整修好三分之一的原有塘堰，加上实行合理用水，就可能扩大灌溉面积九十二万亩以上。各地农民在整修塘堰中劳动热情很高。中江县通山乡农民秦徽雄曾带头跳入冰冷的河水中抢扎漏水的河堰，鼓舞着该乡农民在一天内修整好十二条河堰。射洪县三合乡农民在整修旧塘中进行换工互助，在十多天内整修好四口旧塘，扩大了灌溉面积。朱李火堰一带农民实行“轮灌制”和“浅水灌溉”，灌溉面积便可扩大到十八万亩。
