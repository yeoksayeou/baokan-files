    Develop the Mutual Aid and Cooperation Movement to Support National Industrial Construction
    Agricultural Labor Model Li Shunda
    Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, we have victoriously passed through 1953. As we welcome 1954, we must first pay our respects to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, to the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the Chinese People's Volunteers, to the working class brothers and sisters across the country, and to the peasant brothers and sisters across the country.
    1954 is the second year of our country's first Five-Year Plan. This year, the people of the whole country will work even harder to realize the first Five-Year Plan on the basis of the victories of 1953. After studying the general line and general task of the country during the transition period, all members of our cooperative felt that "our hearts are brighter, our confidence is strengthened, and our enthusiasm for labor is even greater." All members of the cooperative sold 15,000 jin of surplus grain to the state in one go and delivered it to the state warehouse on December 21st.
    Under the leadership of the Party and the People's Government, the members of our Xigou Village Agricultural, Forestry and Animal Husbandry Production Cooperative, through a year of hard work, achieved another bumper harvest in 1953. The whole cooperative cultivated 268.9 mu of autumn fields, with an average yield of 350.5 jin per mu, exceeding the 1952 yield by 11 percent. Among them, the yield was over 400 jin on 11.7 mu of millet and 111.7 mu of corn. We have also achieved success in forestry, planting 3,061 various production trees and 7,777 timber trees, and sowing 360 mu of barren mountains, including 340 Northeast apple trees that will bear fruit in three years. In animal husbandry, the members' livestock are well-fed, and five horses have been mated with Soviet horse breeds. The 304 sheep in the cooperative are also well-managed, with a mortality rate reduced by more than 90 percent compared to 1952. In 1953, our cooperative also built a large dam in the mountain gully and reclaimed滩地. The autumn harvest distribution resulted in benefits for every family and satisfaction for every household. The increasing yields and increased income of the members have demonstrated the superiority of being organized, not only strengthening the determination of the members to run the cooperative but also attracting a large number of farmers to apply for membership.
    After studying the general line, I understand that if our country is to build socialism, we must carry out socialist transformation of agriculture and organize the peasants. Only in this way can we play a greater role and increase agricultural production even more. Taking our Xigou Township (including Xigou, Nansai, and Chidi villages) as an example, the land in Xigou Village is not as good as that in Nansai and Chidi villages, but the average yield per mu in 1953 was 350.5 jin, while the average yield per mu in Nansai and Chidi was only over 270 jin. If the land yield of the whole township could reach the level of Xigou Village, it would increase grain production by 182,000 jin per year. However, if the agricultural production cooperative is compared with the county farm, the farm's yield is more than 40 percent higher than the cooperative's yield. The facts tell us that only agricultural collectivization can produce more grain. Therefore, in welcoming 1954, I want to lead our cooperative members and the farmers of Xigou to work hard to do the following:
    First, we must further deepen the study and promotion of the general line, encourage the farmers' enthusiasm for socialist construction, and advance along the socialist road.
    Second, consolidate and develop mutual aid and cooperative organizations. Our cooperative should expand from the existing 47 households to include an agricultural production cooperative of about 150 households (establishing a branch cooperative in each of Nansai and Chidi), accounting for more than 50 percent of the total number of farm households in the township. We must also encourage more than 90 percent of the remaining households to join mutual aid teams, laying a good foundation for future cooperation.
    Third, we must comprehensively launch the winter production campaign: 1. Winter manure accumulation must reach more than 80 percent of the fertilizer needed for 1954; 2. Each household must transport enough fuel for six months; 3. Develop winter sideline production; 4. Use the money from selling surplus grain to expand reproduction, and make all preparations to strive for an increase of 30 jin of grain per mu in 1954.
    Fourth, continue to strengthen the work of resisting U.S. aggression and aiding Korea, support the Korean people in healing the wounds of war, and strive for a complete peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.
    Dear agricultural labor models and peasant brothers and sisters across the country: We must support industrial construction with practical actions of loving the motherland, carrying out winter production, consolidating and developing mutual aid and cooperative organizations, and striving for a greater harvest in 1954, and under the light of the Party's general line, strive to realize the country's socialist industrialization.

    发展互助合作运动，支援国家工业建设
    农业劳动模范　李顺达
    我们在毛主席的英明领导下胜利地渡过一九五三年。当我们迎接一九五四年时，首先要向中共中央和毛主席致敬，向中国人民解放军和中国人民志愿军致敬，向全国工人老大哥致敬，向全国农民兄弟姐妹们致敬。
    一九五四年是我们国家第一个五年计划的第二年，这一年全国人民将在一九五三年的胜利基础上，更进一步为实现第一个五年建设计划而努力。我们全体社员在最近学习了国家在过渡时期的总路线总任务以后，大家都感到“心里明亮了，信心加强了，劳动劲头更大了。”全体社员把一万五千斤余粮一次卖给国家，并在十二月二十一日都送到了国家仓库。
    我们西沟村农林畜牧生产合作社的社员，在上级党和人民政府的领导下，经过一年的努力，在一九五三年又获得了丰收。全社共经营着二百六十八亩九分秋田，每亩平均产量三百五十斤半，超过一九五二年产量百分之十一。其中产量在四百斤以上的，有谷子十一亩七分，玉米一百一十一亩七分。我们在林业上也获得了成绩，种植各种生产树三千零六十一株，木材树七千七百七十七株，荒山播种三百六十亩，其中种植的三百四十株东北苹果树，再有三年就可结果子了。在畜牧方面，社员的牲口喂得很肥，有五匹马还和苏联马种进行了交配；社内的三百零四只羊，也经管得很好，死亡率比一九五二年减少了百分之九十以上。我社于一九五三年中还在山沟里建了一道大坝，修了滩地。秋收分配的结果，社员家家有利，户户满意。由于产量逐年提高，社员收入增加，显示了组织起来的优越性，不但坚定了社员办社的决心，还吸引着广大农民纷纷要求入社。
    我在学习总路线以后，懂得了我国要建设社会主义，就必须对农业实行社会主义改造，把农民组织起来。这样，才能发挥更大的作用，更多地增加农业生产。拿我们西沟乡（包括西沟、南赛、池底村）来说，西沟村的土地没有南赛、池底两村的好，但一九五三年每亩平均产量是三百五十斤半，而南赛、池底每亩平均产量才二百七十多斤。全乡土地产量如果都能达到西沟村产量的水平，一年就可增产粮食十八万二千斤。但是，农业生产合作社如和县里农场比较，农场产量比合作社产量高百分之四十还多，事实告诉了我们，只有农业集体化才能生产更多的粮食。因此，在迎接一九五四年的时候，我要和我们的社员带动西沟农民，努力作好以下几点：
    第一、要进一步深入学习和宣传总路线，鼓舞农民对社会主义建设的热情，沿着社会主义的道路前进。
    第二、巩固和发展互助合作组织。我社要在现有四十七户的基础上，扩大到包括一百五十户左右的农业生产合作社（南赛、池底各建立一个分社），占全乡总农户数的百分之五十以上。我们并要带动其余农户中百分之九十以上的户数加入互助组，为以后合作化打好基础。
    第三、要全面开展冬季生产运动：一、冬季积肥要达到一九五四年所需肥料的百分之八十以上，二、各户要运够六个月的燃料，三、开展冬季副业生产，四、把出卖余粮的钱用于扩大再生产，做好一切准备，为争取一九五四年每亩增产三十斤粮食而奋斗。
    第四、继续加强抗美援朝工作，支持朝鲜人民医治战后的创伤，为彻底实现朝鲜问题的和平解决而奋斗。
    全国亲爱的农业劳动模范和农民兄弟姐妹们：我们要以热爱祖国，开展冬季生产，巩固和发展互助合作组织，争取一九五四年更大丰收的实际行动，来支援工业建设，在党的总路线照耀下，为实现国家社会主义工业化而奋斗。
