    National Universal Suffrage Movement Achieves Major Results
    Basic-Level Elections Completed in Regions with Over 100 Million People
    As China enters the first year of its planned construction, the universal suffrage movement launched nationwide has achieved significant results. In 1953, basic-level elections were completed in regions with a population of over 100 million across the country, and the first people's congresses of basic-level units were convened.

    Since May of last year, the universal suffrage movement in various regions has been unfolding steadily and in batches, in conjunction with various arduous economic construction tasks, across vast areas. On the vast land of the motherland, from the banks of the Heilongjiang River in the north to the Zhoushan Islands off the East China Sea, from the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region in the south to the most remote areas of the motherland north of the Kunlun Mountains, the broad masses of people have begun to universally and equally exercise their democratic rights as masters of the country. According to recent incomplete statistics, as of mid-December last year, basic-level elections had been launched in batches in 34 provinces and municipalities and the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, covering a total population of approximately 166.6 million.  39,346 basic-level units have completed elections; the population in the areas where elections have been completed is 100.37 million.  Among them, Xikang Province and cities such as Anshan, Fushun, Benxi, Changchun, and Harbin have all completed basic-level elections. Tianjin and Shenyang have also completed elections in urban areas. It is estimated that the entire Northeast region will have more than 70 percent of its basic-level units completing basic-level elections before the end of the year.  After completing basic-level elections throughout the county, Wuchang County in Songjiang Province convened the county people's congress, elected members of the county people's government committee, the county head and deputy county heads, as well as representatives to attend the provincial people's congress.

    In all areas where basic-level elections have been completed, tremendous changes have taken place in the political life of the urban and rural people.  In the great universal suffrage movement, the people have learned how to better manage the affairs of the country.  During the elections, people of all classes strictly reviewed the qualifications of voters, exposed the conspiracies of landlords and counter-revolutionaries who had not yet changed their class status to steal electoral rights, further raised their awareness and vigilance, and clearly distinguished between the enemy and ourselves, thereby consolidating and expanding the ranks of the people. In order to fully fulfill their civic obligations, the broad masses of voters strictly identified and selected representative candidates, enabling a large number of outstanding individuals to directly participate in the management of state affairs. Nationally renowned labor models and advanced individuals such as Meng Tai and Zhang Mingshan of Anshan City, Ma Hengchang of Shenyang City, Li Shunda of Shanxi Province, Lu A'mei of Shanghai City, Zhang Zifu of Fushun City, and Deng Guiyong of Jiangsu Province were all elected as representatives to local people's congresses with extremely high votes. After the election in the Fourth District of Tianjin, forty-three outstanding individuals who had won model titles were elected as people's representatives, including Liu Changfu, a special-class industrial labor model in Tianjin, Wang Deshan, a weaving expert and one of the founders of the "1951 Weaving Method," as well as Gu Fenglan, a security model who bravely arrested special agents in the suppression of counter-revolutionaries, and Zhang Da Niang, who reported her own son in the "Three-Anti" movement. The great universal suffrage movement not only elected a large number of outstanding model figures, but also enabled cadres who had made great achievements in their work but had shortcomings in their work style to correct their shortcomings, and weeded out individual bad elements, those who violated laws and discipline, and those who had committed serious commandist errors and were extremely dissatisfied with by the masses.  In this way, the ties between the government and the people have been greatly strengthened.  Some of the masses said: "In the past, when we saw cadres, we 'held back half of what we wanted to say,' but now we say as much as we want to, we say whatever we have to say." The increasing democratization of politics has further increased the political enthusiasm of the people and enabled new moral qualities of caring for the collective and caring for public affairs to continuously grow.  In the ninth district of Licheng County, Shandong Province, in the month after the universal suffrage, the masses made 1,329 criticisms of cadres and suggestions and requests for matters that should be promoted or reformed, including 575 criticisms of cadres.  This tremendous driving force of the masses has motivated the vast number of cadres to strive to improve their work.  Thirty-two townships in the county immediately reorganized the organization of the township government and improved work efficiency based on the principle of simplified administration and reduced public expenditure after completing the universal suffrage. For example, the preferential treatment committee of Lengshui Gou Township continuously inspected the work of substitute farming four times in three months; the mediation committee not only mediated disputes that were currently occurring, but also resolved the eighteen disputes that had been backlogged in the past.

    The form of the people's congress system of power generated through universal suffrage has proven to be the most suitable form to ensure the implementation of the state's general line and general task during the transition period.  In all industrial and mining areas, the working class accounts for the largest proportion in the people's congresses. In the people's congresses of various districts in cities such as Shenyang, Anshan, and Fushun, worker representatives account for more than 40 to 50 percent. In the people's congresses of townships, they are mostly dominated by peasants and handicraftsmen.  In all areas where universal suffrage has been completed, production issues have been emphasized in the first people's congresses convened, and resolutions have been made to develop industrial and agricultural production. At the first district people's congresses convened in various districts of Shenyang, resolutions were formulated to actively publicize and implement the general line, mobilize workers to continue to deepen the movement to increase production and practice economy, and mobilize people from all walks of life to enthusiastically subscribe to the 1954 national construction bonds, based on the state's general line and general task during the transition period and the urgent demands of the people in the district. In order to welcome and celebrate the victory of the universal suffrage movement, many factories in the city completed the state production plan for the whole year ahead of schedule. After completing the annual plan 36 days ahead of schedule, the staff and workers of the Shenyang Wire Factory put forward a struggle target of increasing production and saving 48.8 billion yuan of wealth for the country before the end of the year.  The workers of the Dalian General Machinery Factory cheered for the system of people's congresses implemented by the state through universal suffrage, and a warm production competition was launched throughout the factory.  The workers in the workshop chased the achievements of the previous shift every time they changed shifts, continuously creating new records.  The factory created more than 190 new achievements and new records in one month.

    In the vast rural areas, the basic-level people's congress system of power generated through universal suffrage is also actively striving to implement the state's general line and general task during the transition period. In the villages and townships where basic-level elections have been completed, the state's general line during the transition period has generally been publicized to the peasants through the township people's congresses. Ningxia, Fujian, Jiangsu, Hunan and other provinces have decided to convene municipal, county, and township people's representative meetings or township people's congresses in all areas to publicize and implement the state's general line during the transition period. Lishan District in Lintong County, Shaanxi Province, has convened township people's congresses in the eleven townships that have completed universal suffrage, with the main topic of publicizing and implementing the state's general line. After the meeting, thirty-nine people's representatives from Baimiao Township have conducted publicity and education on the two development paths to more than 900 adult peasants. After completing basic-level elections throughout the county, Wuchang County in Songjiang Province convened the county people's congress in a timely manner, reported the state's general line to the people's representatives, and correspondingly made a resolution to further develop agricultural production in the county. After the county publicized the general line to the masses through the representatives of the county and village (equivalent to township) people's congresses, the masses' enthusiasm for production increased, and many farmers in mutual aid groups wrote letters to the leading organs of the district, requesting assistance in establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives. Some farmers in the county had a reluctance to sell their surplus grain, but after the people's representatives publicized the state's general line to them, the farmers said: "You are the people's representatives, I elected you, so I believe what you say." They enthusiastically sold their grain to the state.

    The areas where basic-level elections have been completed throughout the country also include many ethnic minority areas where universal suffrage can be carried out. After completing universal suffrage in these areas, the unity of the various ethnic groups has been further strengthened. According to incomplete statistics from the four provinces of Xikang, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Xinjiang, seven counties and 2,955 districts and townships in ethnic minority concentrated and mixed-residence areas have completed basic-level elections. All ethnic minority areas paid attention to allocating the number of representatives appropriately according to the proportion of the population of each ethnic group and at the same time taking care of the ethnic groups with small populations. In Sula Palace Township, Yining County, Xinjiang Province, where nine ethnic groups live together, an average of one representative was elected for every 74 people. During the election, the Uyghur ethnic group produced 17 representatives, the Manchu ethnic group produced 3 representatives, the Kazakh ethnic group produced 1 representative, and the Han, Mongolian, and Russian ethnic groups, whose populations were less than 74, each produced 1 representative. The Xibe ethnic group, whose population was as small as only 7 people, also elected a representative to participate in the leadership of the township government. At the first district and township people's congresses convened in various ethnic minority areas, emphasis was placed on discussing the issues of further strengthening the unity of all ethnic groups and developing agricultural and pastoral production. Some areas have also formulated new ethnic unity covenants and 1954 production plans through the people's congresses. (Xinhua News Agency)

    全国普选运动获重大成果
    一亿以上人口地区完成基层选举工作
    随着我国进入有计划建设的第一年在全国范围内展开的普选运动，已取得了重大的成果。在一九五三年内，全国已在大约一亿以上人口的地区完成了基层政权的选举，召开了基层单位的第一次人民代表大会。
    自去年五月以来，各地的普选运动便在广大的地区内，结合着各种繁重的经济建设任务，分批地稳步展开。在祖国辽阔的土地上，北至黑龙江边，东至东海的舟山群岛，南至桂西僮族自治区，西至昆仑山北麓祖国最遥远的地带，广大人民开始普遍地、平等地行使国家主人翁的民主权利。根据最近不完全的统计，全国至去年十二月中旬为止，已在三十四个省市和内蒙古自治区共约一亿六千六百万人口的地区先后分批展开了基层选举。已完成选举的基层单位有三万九千三百四十六个；完成选举地区的人口有一亿零三百七十万。其中西康省和鞍山、抚顺、本溪、长春、哈尔滨等市已全部完成了基层选举。天津和沈阳等市也已在市区内完成了选举。整个东北区在年底以前，估计将有百分之七十以上的基层单位完成基层选举。松江省五常县在全县完成基层选举以后，已召开了县人民代表大会，选举了县人民政府委员会委员和正副县长，以及出席省人民代表大会的代表。
    在所有完成基层选举的地区，城乡人民的政治生活发生了巨大的变化。人民在伟大的普选运动中学会了怎样更好地管理国家的事务。在选举中，各阶层人民曾对选民资格进行了严格的审查，揭破了那些尚未改变成份的地主阶级分子和反革命分子企图窃取选举权利的阴谋，进一步提高了觉悟程度和警惕性，划清了敌我界限，从而巩固和扩大了人民的队伍。广大选民为了充分地执行他们的公民义务，都对代表候选人进行了严格的鉴别和挑选，使大批优秀人物直接参预了管理国家大事。全国著名的劳动模范和先进人物如鞍山市的孟泰、张明山、沈阳市的马恒昌、山西省的李顺达、上海市的陆阿妹、抚顺市的张子富、江苏省的邓桂永等，都以极高的选票当选为地方人民代表大会的代表。天津市第四区经过选举，有四十三名荣获模范称号的优秀人物当选为人民代表，其中有天津市特等工业劳动模范刘长福，“一九五一织布工作法”创始人之一、织布能手王德山，还有在镇压反革命运动中勇敢捉拿特务的治安模范谷凤兰、在“三反”运动中检举亲生儿子的张大娘等。伟大的普选运动，不仅选出了大批优秀的模范人物，而且使那些工作上虽有很大成绩但作风上有缺点的干部改正了缺点，使个别坏分子、违法乱纪分子和犯有严重命令主义错误而为群众所极端不满的分子被剔除出去。这样，就大大加强了政府和人民的联系。有的群众说：“过去见了干部是‘话到舌尖留半句’，现在是有多少说多少，有什么说什么。”政治的日益民主化，这就更加提高了人民的政治积极性，并使人民关心集体、关心公共事务的新道德品质不断成长起来。山东省历城县第九区在普选以后一个月中，群众对干部的批评及应兴应革事项的建议和要求有一千三百二十九件，其中对干部批评的意见有五百七十五件。群众这种巨大的鞭策力量，推动了广大干部去力求改善自己的工作。该县有三十二个乡在完成普选以后，立即根据政简民勤的原则，整顿了乡政府的组织，提高了工作效率。如冷水沟乡的优抚委员会，三个月内连续检查了四次代耕工作；调解委员会不仅调解现在发生的纠纷，而且把过去积压的十八件纠纷也解决了。
    通过普选所产生的人民代表大会制的政权形式，证明了是保证贯彻国家在过渡时期总路线、总任务最适宜的形式。在所有工矿地区，工人阶级在人民代表大会中占了最大的比重，沈阳、鞍山、抚顺等市内各区的人民代表大会，工人代表都占了百分之四十到五十以上。在乡的人民代表大会中，大都是以农民、手工业者为主。所有完成普选的地区，在召开的首次人民代表大会上，都着重讨论了生产问题，作出了发展工农业生产的决议。沈阳市内各区在召开的第一次区人民代表大会上，都根据国家在过渡时期的总路线、总任务和本区人民的迫切要求，制订了积极宣传贯彻总路线、发动工人继续深入开展增产节约运动、动员各界人民踊跃认购一九五四年国家建设公债等项决议。为了迎接和庆祝普选运动的胜利，该市许多工厂提前完成了全年国家生产计划。沈阳电线厂职工在提前三十六天完成了全年计划以后，又提出在年底前再为国家增产节约四百八十八亿元财富的奋斗指标。大连通用机器厂的工人，为国家实行普选的人民代表大会制度而欢呼，全厂展开了热烈的生产竞赛。车间里每次换班的工人，都尾追着前一班工人的成绩，接连不断地创造出新纪录。该厂在一个月内创造新成绩、新纪录达一百九十多件。
    在广大的农村中，经过普选所产生的人民代表大会制的基层政权，也正积极地为贯彻国家在过渡时期的总路线、总任务而奋斗。在完成基层选举的乡村，大都已通过乡人民代表大会向农民宣传了国家在过渡时期的总路线。宁夏、福建、江苏、湖南等省已决定在所有地区普遍召开市、县、乡人民代表会议或乡人民代表大会，宣传和贯彻国家在过渡时期的总路线。陕西省临潼县骊山区已在完成普选的十一个乡内，召开了以宣传和贯彻国家总路线为主要议题的乡人民代表大会。会后，白庙乡有三十九个人民代表已向九百多个成年农民进行了两条发展道路的宣传教育。松江省五常县在全县完成基层选举以后，已适时地召开了县人民代表大会，向人民代表报告了国家的总路线，并相应地作出了进一步发展全县农业生产的决议。该县通过县、村（相当于乡）人民代表大会的代表向群众宣传总路线以后，群众生产情绪提高，许多互助组的农民写信给区的领导机关，请求帮助创办生产合作社。该县有的农民对余粮有惜售思想，当人民代表向他们宣传了国家的总路线以后，农民说：“你是人民代表，我选出了你，就相信你的话。”他们踊跃地把粮食卖给国家。
    在全国完成基层选举的地区内，还包括了许多可以进行普选的少数民族地区，这些地区在完成普选以后，各民族的团结更进一步增强了。根据西康、广西、贵州和新疆四省的不完全统计，已经完成基层选举的少数民族聚居和杂居的地区有七个县和二千九百五十五个区、乡。各少数民族地区在选举时都注意了按照各民族人口的比例，同时照顾到人口少的民族，适当地分配代表的名额。有九个民族杂居的新疆省伊宁县苏拉宫乡，平均七十四人选一个代表，选举中，维吾尔族产生了十七个代表，满族产生了三个代表，哈萨克族产生了一个代表，人口不足七十四人的汉、蒙、俄罗斯族各产生了一个代表，人口少到只有七人的锡伯族也选出了一个代表参加乡政府的领导工作。各少数民族地区在召开的首次区、乡人民代表大会上，都着重讨论了进一步加强各民族团结和发展农、牧业生产的问题。有的地区还通过人民代表大会制定了新的民族团结公约和一九五四年的生产计划。　（新华社）
