Looking at the Future
——Two Warriors Building the Yunnan Border
　　Guo Guofu
　　I remember it was one afternoon last summer when I arrived at the Seventh Company. The soldiers of the Seventh Company were carrying bricks out of the kiln that had just been extinguished. Here, the May sun, shining on the body is like a fire; the heat in the kiln is even greater, standing ten meters away from the kiln mouth, the heat that spews out, it is熏得让人难受(uncomfortable). The soldiers holding the hot bricks in their hands, like being in the most intense battle, were running in and out. Their faces were covered with sweat and coal dust, it was simply impossible to recognize their faces. Their eyes were all糊住(blurred), and many people had blisters on their hands.
　　When a thin young soldier was about to rush into the kiln mouth again, the instructor grabbed his sleeve and said, "Take a break!" The soldier replied very resolutely: "No, empty it out, so it can be loaded with another kiln." He broke free from the instructor's hand and went in again.
　　"What's his name?" I asked the instructor.
　　"His name is Chen Manchang," the instructor said, "Last night it suddenly rained heavily, and the brick blanks were all晾(drying) on the yard. He rescued them all night, and he was drenched in the rain for several hours. He is really a tireless person." Then, the instructor told me the story of Chen Manchang making seven hundred brick blanks a day.
　　"Is seven hundred a lot or a little?" I asked without understanding.
　　"You'll know by comparing," the instructor said, "I don't know about other places, but the bricklayers here, being able to make four hundred a day, is considered one of the best."
　　Chen Manchang passed by me several times in a hurry. Although it was only a very short few minutes, the impression he left on my mind was particularly deep.
　　That night, I visited him with a feeling of respect. He was lying on the table, holding a pen and writing awkwardly. From the halo of the soybean oil lamp, I could see that he was so young, with a dark face, still retaining the plumpness peculiar to young people, looking like he was not even twenty years old.
　　"What are you writing?" I asked.
　　"Writing a letter to my family," he replied.
　　As soon as he mentioned writing a letter home, I immediately remembered what the instructor had told me about his background.
　　He is from Jian'shui, Yunnan. His family is very poor. His father suffered thirty years of torture in the capitalist's mine, and his mother was beaten to death by a local tyrant. He himself, needless to say, also experienced a lot of suffering in the old society.
　　I was silent for a while, I was afraid that the deep wounds left by the old suffering in his heart would hurt when uncovered. I wanted to avoid talking about his family, but at this time I didn't know what to say. In fact, he always looks ahead, thinking about a beautiful future, and the past hard days have faded in his mind.
　　He quickly changed the subject. He asked me very proudly: "How about it? The bricks we burn, aren't they bad!"
　　"Not bad," I agreed.
　　"We must burn the best bricks," he said, "to be the same color, the same size, and the sound when you knock them must also be the same. Tell me, how can we burn bad bricks? What we are doing is such a meaningful and important job!" He looked at me, as if afraid that I didn't understand what he meant, so he added: "Whoever comes to the border area will say that the border area is a beautiful and rich place. Indeed, the border area has everything you want." His voice became more excited. He stood up, clenched his dark and powerful hands, and continued: "However, the people of all ethnic groups in the border area used to live the poorest and most backward lives of mankind. The imperialist elements and the Kuomintang bandits drove them from the plains into the mountain valleys, stone caves, and mountain tops. They ate grass, wore grass, and lived in grass. In their memories and imaginations, there are no brick houses, no new farm implements, no printed cloth, no roads, no cars... But we are going to build buildings and cities here. We must be at the forefront of building the border area and lead the way for the people of the border area."
　　Listening to what he said, I nodded silently. In front of such a soldier, I felt that there were no appropriate words to express my respectful feelings. (Attached picture)
　　That soldier answered very firmly: "No, empty it out, so it can be loaded with another kiln."

    看着未来的人
    ——建设云南边疆的战士之二
  　郭国甫
    记得是去年夏天的一天下午，我到了七连。七连的战士们正在刚刚熄火的窑里往外搬砖。这里，五月的太阳，晒在身上就像一把火；窑里的火气更大，站在离窑门口十公尺远的地方，喷出来的那股热流，就熏得叫人难受。战士们手里托着火热的砖，像身临最激烈的战斗一样，在跑出钻进。他们满脸的汗水和着满脸的煤灰，简直无法辨认他们的面目。眼睛都给糊住了，许多人手上都起了泡。
    当一个身材瘦小的年轻战士又要匆匆钻进窑口去时，指导员一把拉住了他的袖子说：“歇一会啊！”那个战士很坚决地回答：“不，空出来，好装下一窑。”他挣脱了指导员的手，又钻进去了。
      “他叫什么？”我问指导员。
      “叫陈满昌。”指导员说，“昨夜猛然下起了大雨，砖坯都晾在场子上，抢救了一夜，他在雨里淋了好几个钟头。真是个不知疲倦的人。”接着，指导员又告诉我陈满昌一天做七百块砖坯的故事。
      “七百块是多还是少呢？”我不明白地问。
      “一比较就知道。”指导员说，“别的地方咱不知道，这里的砖瓦匠，一天能做上四百块，就是数一数二的了。”
    陈满昌又好几次从我面前匆匆走过。虽然只有很短的几分钟时间，但他在我脑子里留下的印象是特别深的。
    当天晚上，我怀着崇敬的心情去访问他，他正伏在桌上握着笔不熟练地写字。从豆油灯的光晕中，我才看清他是这样的年青，黑黑的脸，还没有失去少年人特有的丰满，看样子连二十岁都不到。
      “你在写什么？”我问。
      “给家里写信。”他回答说。
    他一提到写家信，我立刻就想起了指导员告诉我的他的身世。
    他是云南建水人。家里很穷。父亲在资本家的矿山里受了三十年的折磨，母亲被恶霸活活打死。他自己，不要说也是经历了不少旧社会苦难的人。
    我沉默了一会，我怕旧的苦难在他心里烙下的深重创伤，一揭起来就会痛。我想避免谈他家里的事，但这时又不知该说什么好。其实，他看的永远是前面，想的是美好的未来，过去的苦难日子，在他心灵中已经很淡了。
    话头很快就被他转过来了。他很得意地问我：“怎么样？我们烧的砖，不坏吧！”
      “不坏。”我同意说。
    “我们一定要烧最好的砖，”他说，“要一个颜色，一个大小，敲起来还要是一个响声。你说吧，我们怎么能烧坏砖呢？我们做的是多么有意义，多么重要的工作啊！”他看看我，好像怕我不明白他这话的意思，于是，又补充说：“谁到边疆，谁都会说边疆是个美丽富足的好地方。的确，边疆是要什么就有什么的。”他的声音更激动了。他立起身来，紧捏着黑黝有力的双手，接着说：“可是，边疆的各族人民，过去过的是人类最贫穷最落后的生活，帝国主义分子和国民党匪帮，把他们从平坝上赶进山坞里、石洞里、山头上，他们吃的是草，穿的是草，住的还是草。在他们的记忆和想像中，没有砖屋瓦房，没有新式农具，没有花布，没有公路，没有汽车……可是我们，就要在这儿建设楼房，建设城市，我们要走在建设边疆的最前列，给边疆人民引路。”
    听着他讲的话，我默默地点着头。在这样的战士面前，我觉得没有恰当的语言来表达自己崇敬的心情。（附图片）
    那个战士很坚强地回答：“不，空出来，好装下一窑。”
