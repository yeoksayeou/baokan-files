Anhui Department Store Zhengyangguan Store
Correctly Utilizes Private Merchants to Supply Goods

The Zhengyangguan Store of the Anhui Provincial Company of the China Department Store Corporation has done a good job in supplying industrial products by correctly utilizing private merchants. In the second half of last year, the store signed fixed supply and sales contracts with 713 private merchants, more than double the number in the first half of the year. In Zhengyangguan alone, 21 of the 24 private department stores proposed to purchase goods from state-owned stores; the total purchase amount increased from 50 percent to 80 percent.

The Zhengyangguan State-owned Department Store has carried out several tasks in utilizing private merchants: 1. Closely integrate with cooperatives, banks, and relevant departments, so that employees in all departments can understand their work tasks and requirements, and unite and utilize private merchants in a step-by-step and planned manner. 2. Hold symposiums for private merchants to listen to their feedback, understand their needs, introduce the styles and varieties of goods, help them calculate detailed accounts, and explain the advantages of low local procurement costs and fast turnover. For merchants who are located further away, the company also uses order planning for cyclical supply to solve the difficulties of small staff and small capital for private merchants. Over the past year, a total of 193 symposiums for private merchants have been held, and regular meetings have been held with more than 2,000 private merchants in more than 30 surrounding market towns. 3. Use different times to hold commodity exhibitions, and attach labels to each commodity on display, indicating the product name, specifications, brand name, and price, to strive for on-the-spot transactions with private merchants. Last year, 13 exhibitions were held, with a total turnover of 1,617.9 million yuan. 4. Cooperate with the bank's deposit and loan business, and sign triangular supply and sales contracts with private merchants on a priority basis. Loan recipients are limited to those who have established business relations with the bank. Private merchants' loans are accompanied by a procurement plan, which is reviewed and approved by the state-owned store, and can be settled by check transfer and liquidation. (Pan Shaozhi)

　　安徽百货公司正阳关商店
　　正确利用私商供应物资
    中国百货公司安徽省公司正阳关商店，正确利用私商，做好了工业品供应工作。该店去年下半年和七百一十三户私商签订了固定的供销合同，比上半年增加了两倍以上。仅正阳关一地二十四家私营百货商店中，就有二十一家向国营商店提出计划进货；进货总金额由百分之五十提高到百分之八十。
    正阳关国营百货商店在利用私商中曾进行了几项工作：一、密切结合合作社、银行及有关部门，使各部门职工都能了解工作任务和要求，有步骤有计划地来团结、利用私商。二、召开私商座谈会，听取私商反映，了解私商的需要，介绍商品的花色、品种，帮助私商算细账，说明当地进货费用少、周转快的好处。对较远的私商，公司并通过订货计划循环供应，解决私商人少、本钱小的困难。一年来，共召开了一百九十三次私商座谈会，和周围三十多个集镇二千多户私商经常见面。三、利用不同时间，举行商品展览会，展出时把每种商品附上标签，注明品名、规格、牌号、价格，争取和私商当场成交。去年先后举行十三次展览会，在会上成交金额共达十六亿一千七百九十万元。四、配合银行存放业务，有重点地和私商签订三角供销合同。贷款对象以和银行建立往来户为限。私商贷款，附有采购计划，由国营商店审核同意，就可用结算方式，以支票划拨清算。　（潘韶之）
