Xinhua News Agency, January 25th: Despite recent pronouncements by the United States that it will strive to reach an agreement with the Soviet Union on the German question at the Four Foreign Ministers Conference, US actions on the eve of the conference prove that the US is using various methods to salvage the "European Army" plan, which mainly involves arming West Germany.

    American officials and public opinion do not conceal the fact that the "European Army" plan occupies a very important position in the American so-called "New Look" military plan. In the State of the Union address delivered by Eisenhower on January 7th and in the foreign policy speech delivered by Dulles on January 12th, these two American decision-makers, while explaining the so-called "New Look" military plan and the so-called "long-term" policy, emphasized the importance of establishing a "European Army." Eisenhower said: "It is extremely important to establish a unified European group including Germany and France within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. The European Defense Community will be able to promote the realization of this goal." As everyone knows, the conspiracy to establish foreign mercenary armies is an important link in this new aggressive policy adopted by the United States to make up for its own insufficient aggressive forces. Precisely because of this, the United States feels particularly anxious about the imminent collapse of the "European Army" plan.

    In order to continue to promote the "European Army" plan in the new situation of the upcoming Four Foreign Ministers Conference, the United States has adopted two methods. On the one hand, the "big stick policy" like the one Dulles used in Paris last December to coerce France to approve the "European Army" treaty is still being used. For example, the "U.S. News & World Report" magazine threatened France in its New Year's Day issue: "The new Big Three – the United States, Britain, and West Germany – are already in sight."

    On the other hand, given that the myth of the so-called "Soviet threat" has completely gone bankrupt, the United States is looking for new slogans to lure European people. The United States and its Western European supporters have begun to talk about "European unity." In the speech mentioned above, Dulles vigorously promoted "Franco-German unity," advocating to "eliminate the suspicions that caused two wars and a world war in our generation." Under the instruction of the United States, Belgian Foreign Minister van Zeeland is also touting that the "European bloc" is a "third force" standing alongside the Soviet Union and the United States. Even Adenauer is now promoting "the spirit of European unity." He told reporters from "Le Figaro" last December that the reason he supports the establishment of a "European Army" is because "the European Defense Community Treaty can prevent the aggressive tendencies of any member state." In addition, American and British news agencies and newspapers constantly release news that they want to revise the existing form of the "European Army" treaty and delete some insignificant clauses to make the treaty easier to accept.

    The recent hasty approval of the "European Defense Community" treaty by the Dutch Upper House, despite popular opposition, is the result of these activities by the United States.

    However, the United States still faces huge difficulties in resisting the trend of international détente and forcibly implementing the "European Army" plan.

    The convening of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference has greatly encouraged the peace aspirations of the people of Western European countries, first and foremost the determination of the German people to strive for peaceful reunification. Recently, both Democratic Germany and West Germany have launched widespread people's movements, demanding that a pan-German agreement be reached so that representatives can be sent to the Four Foreign Ministers Conference to strive for a peaceful solution to the German question. The German Democratic Republic's proposal for a peaceful solution to the German question has had a great impact in both eastern and western Germany.

    The movement of the French people against the ratification of the "European Army" treaty has also reached a new climax. Thousands of deputies, provincial councilors, mayors, and municipal councilors have participated in this movement. In the election of the Speaker of the French National Assembly in mid-January, "European Army" supporter and Popular Republican Georges Bidault finally lost. Recently, many deputies who opposed the "European Army" were re-elected as members of the National Assembly's Defense Committee and Foreign Affairs Committee. These facts reflect the growing strength of the forces opposing the "European Army" in France.

    In Italy, although Christian Democrat Amintore Fanfani barely formed a new cabinet, the strength of the Italian people is powerful, and the political crisis of the ruling group is so deep that even Reuters believes that this "new government cannot gather a parliamentary majority to ratify the European Defense Community treaty under the current circumstances."

    The attempt to ratify the "European Army" treaty has also been frustrated in Belgium. When the Belgian Upper House debated the issue of ratifying the "European Army" treaty in December 1953, many members vehemently opposed the treaty. Even the Speaker of the Upper House, Catholic Party member Paul Struye, said that ratifying the "European Army" treaty was unconstitutional. As a result, the matter of ratifying the "European Army" treaty was delayed.

    Under these circumstances, American and British bourgeois public opinion admit that the convening of the Four Foreign Ministers Conference will make it more difficult for the United States to establish a "European Army." Reuters predicted in its New Year's outlook: "Regardless of the success or failure of the Berlin Conference, its results will inevitably have a profound impact on Western policy, especially on the European Army plan, which is already in trouble."

### 四外长会议的召开鼓舞西欧人民争取和平  美国建立“欧洲军”的计划遭遇更多的困难

    四外长会议的召开鼓舞西欧人民争取和平
    美国建立“欧洲军”的计划遭遇更多的困难
    【新华社二十五日讯】尽管美国近来口口声声说，要在四国外长会议上努力和苏联就德国问题达成协议，然而美国在四国外长会议前夕的活动证明：美国正用种种办法来挽救以武装西德为主要内容的“欧洲军”计划。
    美国官方人物和舆论并不掩饰：“欧洲军”计划在美国所谓“新面貌”军事计划中，占有十分重要的位置。在一月七日艾森豪威尔发表的国情咨文里以及在一月十二日杜勒斯发表的外交政策演说里，这两个美国决策人物都在解释所谓“新面貌”军事计划和所谓“长期”政策的同时，强调建立“欧洲军”的重要性。艾森豪威尔说：“在北大西洋公约组织之内建立一个包括德国和法国的统一的欧洲集团是极其重要的。欧洲防务集团将能促进这一目的的实现。”大家知道，建立外国雇佣军的阴谋，正是美国为了弥补本身侵略力量不足而采取的这个新侵略政策的重要环节。正因为如此，美国对于“欧洲军”计划的濒于破产，感到特别的焦虑。
    为了在四国外长会议即将召开的新情势下继续推行“欧洲军”计划，美国采用了两种手段。一方面，像杜勒斯去年十二月在巴黎记者招待会上胁迫法国批准“欧洲军”条约的那种“大棒政策”在继续运用。例如“美国新闻与世界报道”杂志在元旦出版的一期里就恫吓法国说：“新的三大国——美国、英国、西德——已经在望。”
    另一方面，鉴于所谓“苏联威胁”的神话已经完全破产，美国正在找寻诱骗欧洲人民上当的新口号。美国和它的西欧支持者们开始大谈起“欧洲团结”了。杜勒斯在上面提到的那篇演说里就大肆宣传“法德团结”，宣传要“消灭两次引起战争的、在我们这一代引起世界大战的猜忌”。在美国授意之下，比利时外交大臣樊齐兰，也在鼓吹“欧洲集团”是和苏联、美国鼎足而立的“第三种力量”。甚至连阿登纳，现在也宣扬“欧洲团结的精神”了。他在去年十二月对“费加罗报”记者说，他之所以赞成建立“欧洲军”，是因为“欧洲防务集团条约可以防止任何成员国的侵略倾向”。此外，美、英通讯社和报刊还不时放出空气，说要修改现有形式的“欧洲军”条约，要删去其中一些无关紧要的条款，好使条约更容易被人接受。
    荷兰议会上院最近不顾人民的反对匆匆批准了“欧洲防务集团”条约，正是美国这些活动的结果。
    然而，美国要抗拒国际局势缓和的趋势而强力推行“欧洲军”计划，仍然有着巨大困难。
    四国外长会议的召开大大地鼓舞了西欧各国人民的和平愿望，首先是德国人民争取和平统一的决心。最近，民主德国和西德都广泛展开了人民运动，要求达成全德协议以便派代表出席四国外长会议争取德国问题的和平解决。德意志民主共和国关于和平解决德国问题的主张，在德国东部和西部都产生了很大影响。
    法国人民反对批准“欧洲军”条约的运动也达到了新的高潮。成千的议员、省议员、市长和市政委员都参加了这个运动。在一月中旬法国国民议会议长选举中，“欧洲军”的拥护者、人民共和党人普夫朗朗终于落选。最近反对“欧洲军”的许多议员都重新当选为国民议会国防委员会和外交委员会的委员。这些事实，都反映了法国国内反对“欧洲军”的力量更加壮大。
    在意大利，天主教民主党人范范尼虽然勉强组成新阁，但是意大利人民力量是强大的，而统治集团的政治危机又十分深刻，以致路透社都认为这个“新政府不能够在目前的情况下集合一个议会多数来批准欧洲防务集团条约”。
    批准“欧洲军”条约的企图在比利时也遭到了挫折。一九五三年十二月间，比利时议会上院对批准“欧洲军”条约的问题举行辩论时，许多议员都猛烈反对这个条约。连上院议长、天主教党人保罗·斯特律耶都说：批准“欧洲军”条约是违反宪法的。结果，批准“欧洲军”条约的事就拖了下来。
    在这种情形之下，美国和英国的资产阶级舆论承认，四国外长会议的召开，将使美国建立“欧洲军”的活动更加困难。路透社在新年瞻望前途时预料：“不论柏林会议成败如何，其结果必然会对西方政策，特别是对已陷入困境的欧洲军计划，发生深远的影响。”
