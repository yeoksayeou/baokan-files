All Members of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative
Write a Letter to Chairman Mao Zedong

Respected Chairman Mao:

As we celebrate the tenth anniversary of the establishment of our cooperative, we report to you with the most grateful hearts: We have followed the path of "organizing" as instructed by you and the Communist Party for ten years. Ten years of experience have made each of us deeply realize that the road of mutual aid and cooperation is a happy road, a bright road, and a road for farmers to completely turn over. Along this road, we have developed from a "land cooperation group" of four households to today's large agricultural production cooperative including 287 households. Under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, along this road, we have not only overcome disasters with collective strength, overcoming many natural disasters that individual farmers could not overcome, but also turned dry land into paddy fields and barren land into fertile land. In the past ten years, we have dug 58 wells in places that were previously considered impossible to dig, transforming more than 940 mu of dry land into paddy fields, enabling land that previously only yielded 200 jin of grain to yield more than 400 jin. This road has also provided support for the elderly and widowed households. In our village, 43 families of revolutionary martyrs, military personnel, workers, and elderly and widowed households have had their production guaranteed and their lives improved because they joined the cooperative. This road has freed us from the threats of high-interest loans, land sales, poverty, and bankruptcy. We are now gradually living a relatively prosperous life. We know that this is entirely the result of your correct leadership, the Communist Party, and the People's Government.

We have studied the general line and general tasks of the country during the transition period, and everyone sincerely supports them, greatly enhancing our understanding. We not only understand the significance of taking the road of mutual aid and cooperation, but we have also personally experienced the benefits brought about by the road of mutual aid and cooperation. In commemorating the tenth anniversary of the establishment of the cooperative, all members of our cooperative feel extremely honored for the development and growth of the cooperative over the past ten years and for gradually embarking on the road of socialism.

Chairman Mao, this glory is entirely given by you! We have unspeakable gratitude for your concern, and we must always maintain this glory and continue to move forward under the beacon of the general line.

Last year, our cooperative director, Comrade Geng Changsuo, returned from a visit to the Soviet Union and reported on the happy life of Soviet farmers, which gave us great encouragement. We also often look forward to farming with machines. On the very day of our meeting, we saw our tractors, and everyone was extremely happy. How much we hope that the country will build more factories as soon as possible and achieve industrialization early! In order to support the country in gradually realizing socialist industrialization, we have sold 160,000 jin of surplus grain and oil to the state. Next year, we plan to apply more coarse fertilizer and less fine fertilizer, reducing fertilizer costs by 79%. We also plan to increase the yield per mu by about 50%. We also plan to gradually install pumps on all the wells in the village, turning all the dry land into paddy fields. In addition, we will build a 25-li long shelterbelt to gradually eliminate the threat of drought, flood, and wind and sand disasters. By then, we will be able to produce more grain and industrial raw materials to supply industrial construction and the needs of the people. Worker comrades run factories, and we run agricultural production cooperatives. They produce more machines and daily necessities, and we produce more grain and industrial raw materials. Our country will definitely be able to gradually live a good socialist life.

Chairman Mao! In order to repay your concern for us, we must strive to improve our socialist consciousness and collectivist ideology, improve our farming techniques, and improve our management capabilities, in order to produce more grain and industrial raw materials, to support national industrialization, and to further consolidate, develop, and continuously improve our agricultural production cooperative.

I wish you good health forever!
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　All Members of the Geng Changsuo Agricultural Production Cooperative

    写给毛泽东主席的信
    敬爱的毛主席：
    我们在建社十周年的时候，以最感激的心情向你报告：我们按着你和共产党指示的“组织起来”的道路走过了十年。十年经验，使我们每个人都深切地体验到：互助合作的道路是幸福的大道，光明的大道，农民彻底翻身的大道。沿着这条道路，我们从四户的“土地合作组”已发展成了今天包括有二百八十七户的大农业生产合作社了。在共产党和人民政府的领导下，沿着这条道路，我们用集体的力量不仅渡过了灾荒，战胜了多次单干农民所不能克服的自然灾害，而且我们还把旱地变成了水田、把瘦地变成了肥地。十年的工夫，我们已在过去认为不能打井的地方，打了五十八眼水井，变九百四十多亩旱地为水田，使十年前只产二百斤粮食的土地能收到四百多斤了。这条道路使孤寡户也有了依靠，我们村里已有四十三家烈属、军属、工属和孤寡户因为入了社生产得到了保障，生活得到了改善。这条道路使我们摆脱了借高利贷、卖地、贫困、破产的威胁，我们现在已经一步一步地过起比较富裕的日子了。我们知道：这完全是你，是共产党，是人民政府正确领导的结果。
    我们已经学习了国家在过渡时期的总路线和总任务，大伙都衷心拥护，大大提高了认识。我们不但懂得了走互助合作道路的意义，而且已经亲身体验到了互助合作道路所带来的好处。在纪念建社十周年的时候，我们全社社员为十年来社的发展壮大，为已经一步一步走上社会主义的道路而感到无上光荣。
    毛主席，这光荣完全是你给的呀！我们对你的关怀有说不出的感激，我们一定要永远保持这个光荣，在总路线的灯塔照耀下，继续前进。
    去年，我们的社长耿长锁同志从苏联参观回来，报告了苏联农民的幸福生活，给了我们很大的鼓舞，我们也常常盼望着用机器种地，就在我们开会的这一天，看到了咱们的拖拉机，大家高兴极了，我们多么希望国家赶快多办工厂，早点工业化呀！为了支持国家逐步实现社会主义工业化，我们已把十六万斤余粮和油料卖给国家。明年我们打算多施粗肥，少施细肥，把肥料成本降低百分之七十九。把每亩地的产量再提高百分之五十左右。我们还打算把全村的水井都逐步安装上抽水机，使所有旱田都变成水田。另外，要营造二十五里长的防护林带，逐步消除旱涝风沙灾害的威胁。到那时，我们就可以生产更多的粮食和工业原料，供给工业建设和人民的需要。工人同志们办工厂，我们办农业生产合作社，他们多生产机器和日用品，我们多生产粮食和工业原料，咱国家便一定能一步一步地过上社会主义的好日子。
    毛主席！为了报答你对我们的关心，我们一定努力提高自己的社会主义觉悟和集体主义思想，提高耕作技术，提高经营管理的能力，为多生产粮食和工业原料，为支持国家工业化，为进一步巩固发展和不断提高我们的农业生产合作社而努力。
    祝你身体永远健康！
