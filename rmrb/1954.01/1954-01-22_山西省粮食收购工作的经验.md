The following is an account of grain procurement work in Shanxi Province

Experiences in Grain Procurement Work in Shanxi Province
The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

The grain procurement work in Shanxi Province concluded victoriously by January 10th, exceeding the state grain procurement plan by 10.9 percent, with 99.4 percent of the procured grain already in storage.

After the province vigorously publicized the Party's general line for the transition period, a mass patriotic grain sales campaign quickly emerged within a month, simultaneously sparking a new upsurge in agricultural production and mutual aid and cooperation movements. Through grain procurement, the spontaneous growth of capitalist forces in rural areas was effectively curbed, leading to profound changes in the political, ideological, economic, and cultural aspects of the countryside, and a new atmosphere of taking the socialist road permeated everywhere.

The main experiences of grain procurement work in Shanxi Province are as follows:

I. Adequate preparatory work is essential. Starting from the grain work conference convened by the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party on October 25th of last year, attended by county party secretaries and county heads, preparations were actively undertaken. The preparation stage lasted one and a half months, focusing on the publicity and education of the general line and grain policies, and making good ideological mobilization work from top to bottom and from within to without. A series of meetings were held at each level – enlarged county party committee meetings, county party activist meetings, county people's representative conferences, village party branch member meetings, and township people's representative conferences. Through these meetings, ideological obstacles were cleared, and specific plans for grain procurement were formulated. More than 25,000 cadres from district level and above were organized to go to the countryside to work. More than one million activists were trained. More than one thousand cadres were dispatched to reinforce local grain departments, and a system of political deputy positions was established within the grain system. Sufficient preparations were made early in increasing warehouse grain stations, expanding material supply, and allocating currency. Therefore, after the commencement of the procurement work, it could be rapidly and comprehensively unfolded, forming a patriotic grain sales and mutual aid cooperation upsurge in the countryside.

II. The publicity and education of the general line must be truly understood by every household. There are three main reasons why the publicity of the general line was so effective this time: (1) Addressing the ideological conditions of leading cadres at all levels above the district level, helping them to clarify four issues, namely, whether the peasant masses currently have the enthusiasm to take the socialist road? Is the gradual realization of national socialist industrialization beneficial to the peasants? Who benefits from the state's purchase of grain? Why can the state's purchase of grain promote the development of the mutual aid and cooperation movement? If they are not first made to understand these issues, the general line cannot be well publicized to the broad masses. (2) It is necessary to establish a strong team to publicize the general line. This problem was mainly solved in the preparation stage. In Shanxi Province, more than 25,000 cadres went to the countryside, plus more than one million activists, almost all of whom underwent a week to ten days of intensive training. (3) To carry out the publicity and education of the general line, it is necessary to connect with reality and use methods such as recollection and comparison to clearly calculate three accounts, namely, the accounts of production, life, and prices over the past four years. In particular, the comparison of two typical villages with good and bad mutual aid and cooperation work had the greatest educational effect on the masses. By adopting these methods, the broad masses were able to draw a clear line between the socialist and capitalist roads, clarify the relationship between workers and peasants, the relationship between individuals and the state, the relationship between immediate and long-term interests, and understand the path of socialism.

III. We must adhere to the guiding principle of "combining grain procurement work with winter production and the development of agricultural producers' cooperatives." The one-sided view that procurement of grain could not promote agricultural production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement, as well as the idea of carrying out procurement work in isolation, were criticized. It was pointed out that "developing production and ensuring needs" is the basic principle of our country's economic development. Production activities are the main body of peasants' lives. Any work that is divorced from production is bound to be divorced from the peasant masses. Therefore, Shanxi Province simultaneously put forward two plans for grain purchase and production and mutual aid cooperation at various meetings. After the movement was launched, typical experiences in this area were continuously reported. When the patriotic grain sales movement was launched in the countryside, it was promptly proposed to guide peasants to spend money from the perspective of developing production and to supply peasants with means of production as much as possible. In this way, on the one hand, agricultural producers' cooperatives and year-round mutual aid teams played a leading and exemplary role in the patriotic grain sales movement; on the other hand, the patriotic grain sales movement promoted the development of winter production and the mutual aid and cooperation movement.

IV. The patriotic grain sales movement should be regarded as a good opportunity to strengthen ideological education inside and outside the Party, rectify various organizations, and transform backward villages. Every party member should be called upon to actively participate in the study of the general line, and actively and exemplarily participate in the mass patriotic grain sales and mutual aid cooperation movements. Local party committees should emphasize using the general line to check the work of mutual aid cooperation and the implementation of grain policies. Good people and good deeds should be commended and typical bad people and bad deeds should be handled in a timely manner during the movement to achieve the purpose of education. At the end of the movement, a general summary, education and appraisal of party members' work should be carried out. As a result of the above-mentioned measures taken by Shanxi Province, not only was the completion of the grain purchase plan guaranteed, but also the combat effectiveness of the rural Party grassroots organizations and the political level of the party members were improved.

V. How to ensure the correct implementation of the Party's grain procurement policy is also a major issue in grain procurement work. To achieve this, it is necessary to: (1) combine the working method of using the administrative appeal of the government from top to bottom with the working method of relying on party members, members of the Communist Youth League, and activists to do a good job of ideological mobilization of the masses; (2) emphasize the unity of poor and middle peasants. The behavior of peasants and handicraftsmen in purchasing food grain should not be regarded as hoarding for speculation in all cases, nor should the relationship of peasants borrowing small amounts of grain from each other be regarded as usury exploitation in order to ensure the smooth development of grain purchase work; (3) carefully study the grain situation in rural areas, correctly determine the purchase plan, and supplement it with democratic appraisal; and (4) in addition to publicizing the state's unified price policy for grain and strictly managing the market, it is necessary to fully pay attention to the issue of supply during procurement, especially ensuring timely supply to grain-deficient households.

VI. We must take grain procurement work as the center, expand the exchange of materials between urban and rural areas, and party and government leading organs at all levels must strengthen the overall leadership of economic work. This time, the unprecedented effectiveness of the coordinated actions of the agricultural, grain, trade, finance, local industry, finance, taxation, transportation and other financial and economic systems in Shanxi Province during grain procurement was unprecedented. This not only smoothly solved the problems of grain procurement and material supply, mobilizing peasants to save money in banks and credit cooperatives, etc., but the most important gain was improving the relationship between various economic departments and improving the leadership level of party and government leading organs at all levels over economic work.

    山西省粮食收购工作的经验
    中共山西省委
    山西省粮食收购工作，至一月十日已胜利结束，超额完成国家粮食收购计划百分之一十点九，已入库粮食为收购数的百分之九十九点四。
    全省大张旗鼓地宣传党在过渡时期的总路线之后，不到一个月的时间内，就普遍地掀起了群众性的爱国售粮热潮，同时也普遍地掀起了农业增产和互助合作运动的新高潮。经过收购粮食，有力地打击了农村资本主义自发势力的滋长，从而使农村面貌在政治、思想、经济、风尚等各方面都起了深刻的变化，到处洋溢着走社会主义道路的新气象。
    山西省粮食收购工作的主要经验是：
    一、必须充分作好准备工作。从去年十月二十五日中共山西省委召开的有县委书记、县长参加的粮食工作会议开始，即积极进行准备工作。准备阶段历时一个半月，以贯彻总路线和粮食政策的宣传教育，作好自上而下自内而外的思想发动工作为中心环节；逐级开好一系列的会议——县委扩大会议、各县党的活动分子会议、县人民代表会议、乡村党支部党员大会、乡人民代表会议等。通过这些会议，打通思想，制定收购粮食的具体方案；组织区以上两万五千余干部下乡工作；训练积极分子一百多万人；派遣了一千多干部充实各地粮食部门，并建立了粮食系统的政治副职制度；在增设仓库粮站，扩大物资供应，调拨货币等方面也都及早进行了充分准备。因而收购工作开始后，就能迅速地全面地展开，形成农村中爱国售粮与参加互助合作的热潮。
    二、贯彻总路线的宣传教育，真正做到家喻户晓。此次宣传总路线之所以成效卓著，主要有三个原因：（一）针对区以上各级领导干部的思想状况，帮助他们弄清楚四个问题，即目前在农民群众中有没有走社会主义道路的积极性？逐步实现国家的社会主义工业化对农民是否有利？国家收购粮食对谁有利？为什么国家收购粮食可以促进互助合作运动的发展？如果不使他们先弄清楚这些问题，就不能向广大群众很好地展开总路线的宣传。（二）必须建立一支宣传总路线的强大队伍。在准备阶段主要解决了这个问题。山西省有两万五千多干部下乡，加上一百多万积极分子，差不多都经过一个星期至十天的集中训练。（三）进行总路线的宣传教育，必须联系实际，运用回忆对比等方法算清三笔账，即四年来生产、生活、物价的账。特别是对比互助合作工作好坏的两种典型村，对群众的教育作用最大。采取了这些方法，就能使广大群众划清了社会主义和资本主义两条道路的界限，弄清了工农关系、个人和国家的关系、眼前和长远利益的关系，明确了走社会主义的路。
    三、必须坚持“收购粮食工作和冬季生产、发展农业生产合作社相结合”的指导方针。批判了不相信收购粮食工作能够促进农业生产和互助合作运动发展的片面观点，以及想孤立地进行购粮工作的思想。指出“发展生产、保证需要”是我国经济发展的基本法则。生产活动是农民生活的主体，进行任何工作，如果离开了生产，就必然要脱离农民群众。因此，山西省在各种会议上，都同时提出购粮和生产、互助合作两个方案。在运动展开之后，又不断地通报了这一方面的典型经验。当农村中爱国售粮运动发动起来后，又及时地提出了要从发展生产出发来指导农民花钱，尽可能地供应农民生产资料。这样，一方面农业生产合作社和常年互助组在爱国售粮运动中发挥了带头示范作用，另一方面，爱国售粮运动又促进了冬季生产和互助合作运动的发展。
    四、要把爱国售粮运动作为一次加强党内外思想教育，整顿各种组织，和改造落后村工作的良好机会。要号召每个党员积极参加学习总路线，并积极地模范地参加群众性爱国售粮和互助合作运动。各地党委要强调用总路线来检查互助合作工作及对粮食政策的执行情形。在运动中及时表扬好人好事和处理典型的坏人坏事，以达到教育的目的。在运动末期，要普遍进行总结，教育和鉴定党员工作。山西省采取上述措施的结果，不仅保证了购粮计划的完成，而且提高了农村党的基层组织的战斗力和党员的政治水平。
    五、如何保证正确地贯彻党的粮食收购政策，也是收购粮食工作中的大问题。要做到这一点，必须：（一）使自上而下运用政权的行政号召的工作方式和依靠党员、青年团员、积极分子作好群众的思想发动的工作方式相结合。（二）必须强调贫农和中农的团结。不能把农民及手工业者购买食用粮食的行为，一律当作囤积居奇，也不能把农民之间互相借贷少量粮食的关系都当作高利贷剥削关系来看待，以保证购粮工作的顺利展开。（三）必须仔细研究农村粮食情况，正确地确定收购方案，并辅之以民主评议。（四）除宣传国家对粮食的统一的价格政策及严格进行市场管理外，必须在收购时也充分注意到供应问题，特别是对缺粮户要及时保证供应。
    六、要以收购粮食工作为中心，扩大城乡物资交流，各级党政领导机关要加强对经济工作的全面领导。这次山西省在收购粮食中，农业、粮食、贸易、金融、地方工业、财政、税收、交通运输等财经系统协同一致，配合行动的功效是空前未有的。这不但顺利地解决了收购粮食和物资供应、发动农民向银行和信用合作社储蓄等等问题，最重要的收获是改善了各个经济部门的关系，提高了各级党政领导机关对经济工作的领导水平。
