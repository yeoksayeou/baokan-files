　　Basic Experiences of Establishing Agricultural Producers' Cooperatives in Heilongjiang Province
　　Rural Work Department of the Heilongjiang Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China

　　In order to gain experience in establishing agricultural producers' cooperatives, educate and train cadres for establishing cooperatives, and lay the foundation for fully launching the work of establishing cooperatives in 1954, twenty-eight counties in Heilongjiang Province organized a large number of cadres (according to statistics from twenty-eight counties, a total of 362 county and district cadres were organized) in early November 1953 to conduct typical experimental work in establishing cooperatives. Seventy-three new agricultural producers' cooperatives were established.

　　The organizational scale of the newly established agricultural producers' cooperatives is generally appropriate. According to statistics from sixty-two cooperatives in twenty-two counties including Suihua, there are 942 households, averaging about 15 or 16 households per cooperative, with a maximum of 29 households and a minimum of 13 or 14 households. According to statistics from seven cooperatives in six counties including Hailun, there are 172 male laborers and 132 female laborers, averaging 24 or 25 male laborers per cooperative. According to statistics from seven cooperatives in six counties including Hailun, there are 752.5 hectares of land, 168 head (or pairs) of livestock, and 34 carts, averaging 4.37 hectares of land per laborer, 4.46 hectares of land per head of draught animal, and more than 22 hectares of land per cart.

　　The organizational foundation of these newly established cooperatives is also relatively good. According to statistics from seven cooperatives in six counties including Hailun (the predecessors of these cooperatives were ten year-round mutual aid teams), nine teams were year-round mutual aid teams for more than two years, and one was a year-round mutual aid team for more than one year.

　　These cooperatives also have a relatively large and strong core force. According to statistics from sixty-two cooperatives in twenty-two counties including Suihua, there are 114 Party members, 115 members of the Communist Youth League, and 245 active elements among the masses, averaging seven core members per cooperative.

　　In the typical experimental work of establishing cooperatives, the goal of "gaining experience, educating key members, and promoting other work" was generally achieved, laying a good foundation for establishing more cooperatives. The basic experiences gained by the counties are:

　　I. Correctly determining the targets for establishing cooperatives, carefully checking the conditions for establishing cooperatives, training new cooperative key members, and preparing for the work of establishing cooperatives are prerequisites for doing a good job in establishing cooperatives. After the end of the autumn harvest, each county, based on its daily understanding, the demands of the masses, and the foundation of mutual assistance, initially determined the targets for establishing cooperatives, and the leadership organized the masses to study the cooperative charter in a planned way. They also cultivated new cooperative key members in the form of studying production, participating in meetings of old cooperative key members, and organizing visits. They carried out publicity and deliberation among the team members, initially clarified the purpose of running the cooperative, the nature of the cooperative, and the principles of distribution, and clarified the confused thoughts of some members. Before the formal establishment of the cooperative, the procedures of "the mutual aid team making a request, the village researching and requesting instructions, the district committee reviewing, and the county committee approving" were generally followed. Therefore, the targets for establishing cooperatives generally had relatively mature conditions and had undergone sufficient ideological deliberation, laying a good foundation for establishing cooperatives.

　　II. Fully conducting ideological education and raising the socialist consciousness of farmers is the central link to ensure the success of establishing cooperatives.

　　First, it is necessary to go deep into the team, help summarize the production of the past year, and further understand the situation so as to have a clear understanding of the situation. The content of understanding mainly includes: organizational foundation, mass demands, current and past production and living conditions, the situation of key activists, and ideological concerns of the masses.

　　Then, it is necessary to conduct education on the general line, combined with specific examples, targeting actual thoughts. The content should be: (1) Use the examples of the rise in production and living standards in the village and team over the past few years, and connect them with the production and living conditions of Soviet collective farmers to educate on the Party's general line during the transition period, improve the masses' understanding of national industrialization and agricultural cooperation, and encourage them to move forward to socialism. Many places have carried out the above-mentioned education, which has improved the farmers' awareness and stimulated their confidence and determination to take the new road. Some farmers said: "In the past, working for the landlords meant not enough to eat and wear. In winter, my wife wore single trousers and a half-length cotton jacket, and we had no quilt at night. After the land reform, the inter-group production was good, and life has been getting better year by year. I must believe in what the Party says, join the cooperative, and run the cooperative well, step by step to socialism." (2) Through summarizing the advantages shown by local mutual aid teams and cooperatives, conduct education on the superiority of collective management, so that farmers can further understand the purpose and future of agricultural cooperatives. (3) Introduce the local original cooperative's principles and methods of share dividends, and educate farmers on the nature of agricultural cooperatives, relevant policies, and management policies, and eliminate farmers' misunderstandings and concerns. (4) Conduct education on democratic cooperative management, enhance the sense of ownership and responsibility of cooperative members and key members, and establish a style of democratic cooperative management. In terms of educational methods, it should be flexible: individual visits, small-scale seminars, general meetings, small group discussions, exhibitions, etc. can be used. For different objects, different small-scale seminars should be held, such as women's, youth's, old men's, and old women's seminars, etc. This makes it easy for everyone to understand the significance of establishing cooperatives and achieve true conscious voluntarism.

　　Experience has proved that farmers' participation in agricultural producers' cooperatives is a serious change in production and life; whether to join the cooperative or not, they need to go through repeated comparisons and complex ideological struggles before they can decide. Therefore, throughout the entire process of establishing cooperatives, it is necessary to continuously and patiently conduct education to gradually improve the socialist consciousness of the masses. Only when farmers generally understand the socialist prospects and the benefits of participating in agricultural producers' cooperatives will they actively and consciously join agricultural producers' cooperatives.

　　III. On the basis of fully conducting ideological education, democratically discuss and determine the principles and methods of share dividends in accordance with policies and principles and in light of local conditions, and cautiously and correctly handle the issue of share dividends, which is also an important key to successfully establishing, developing, and consolidating agricultural producers' cooperatives. This is the issue that farmers pay the most attention to, discuss the most enthusiastically, and argue the most intensely about. The principle of handling this issue must be based on the semi-socialist nature of agricultural producers' cooperatives, adhere to a certain principle of distribution according to work, and at the same time give cooperative members a reasonable price for private means of production. It is necessary to respect the interests of middle peasants and avoid disguised exploitation by rich peasants, strengthen the unity of poor and middle peasants, and fully promote democracy in a guided and prepared manner to reasonably determine various systems. The situation in various places in dealing with these issues is as follows: (1) Land: According to the actual management situation at the ground level, refer to the local rent to classify grades and collect rent, fixed rent for "dead" rent, flexible rent for "live" rent; for collective reclamation, members voluntarily bring them into the cooperative for collective ownership, and those who do not participate in the reclamation will give the reclaimers reasonable remuneration; the amount of classification should depend on the size of the unit output, and should be reasonably determined according to the actual situation in various places and the opinions of farmers to prevent uniformity. In individual places where there is a lot of land and the quality is not good, cooperative members voluntarily hand it over to the cooperative for use without compensation. If the farmers are indeed voluntary, it should not be stopped; but it is generally not encouraged. (2) Draught animals: Generally, a leasing system is adopted, and the amount of rent is based on the use value of the draught animal and the interest rate of the credit department, and annual classification is implemented to collect rent; some are rated on a quarterly basis, scoring when the horse is used, and distributing grain according to the score. The former is more common, and the latter accounts for a small number. (3) Large farm tools: Most of them adopt the method of grading and collecting rent and flexible rent for "dead" rent. A few adopt the method of pricing and turning over to public ownership. According to statistics from thirty-eight cooperatives in fifteen counties including Suihua, twenty-nine cooperatives collect rent for large farm tools, and nine cooperatives are priced and turned over to public ownership. (4) Horse fodder and seeds: Most of them are based on the average shareholding per horse and per labor, as a fund; some are borrowed in the spring and repaid in the autumn, with a certain amount of interest paid. The former is the majority, and the latter accounts for a small number. According to statistics from thirty-eight cooperatives, thirty-three cooperatives have average shareholding, and five cooperatives borrow in the spring and repay in the autumn.

　　Trial experience in various places has proved that in dealing with the issue of means of production and investment, on the one hand, cooperative members must be educated to act in accordance with the policies of agricultural producers' cooperatives, and on the other hand, democracy must be truly promoted, and reasonable decisions must be made based on local conditions, mass habits, and mass awareness, and uniformity cannot be forced.

　　IV. Mobilizing farmers to voluntarily sign up to join the cooperative, democratically electing the board of directors, establishing labor organization, political work, and financial accounting systems, and democratically formulating the cooperative charter are major issues related to the masses establishing their own collective economic organizations, and democracy must be promoted and meticulous work must be done. (1) Mobilizing to sign up to join the cooperative must be carried out on the basis of thorough deliberation by the whole family; it can be negotiated individually in advance, and then openly signed up for registration to show caution. (2) The democratic election of cadres is a major concern for cooperative members, and must be fully deliberated to determine the conditions of cadres (fair, capable, good at labor), and then democratically elected. After the establishment of the board of directors, it should immediately clarify the division of labor, unify thinking, and study the work within the cooperative. (3) According to the size of the cooperative, production needs, and technical level, establish corresponding labor organizations, study labor day calculation methods, democratically discuss various division of labor responsibilities, and feasible political work systems and financial systems. According to the experience of various places, in order to establish a good financial work system, it is first necessary to implement the idea of "increasing production and practicing economy, running the cooperative diligently and frugally" among all cooperative members. In 1954, the province generally abolished the method of eating together and stipulated that horses should be fed by themselves during slack seasons to reduce waste.

　　V. The process of establishing a cooperative is a process of closely integrating production and promoting production, and must start with production and end with production. At the beginning, summarize team production, understand the situation, and conduct education; in the process of establishing the cooperative, solve the problems existing in the original team and promote production actions. After the cooperative is established, plan and promote the development of winter sideline production and prepare for spring plowing. Conducting education, establishing organizations, determining systems, and equipping cadres must all be subject to production needs and must not be separated from current production actions. Many newly established cooperatives have implemented this approach with good results.

　　VI. The work of establishing cooperatives must rely on and be carried out through local branches and key members. All important steps and major decisions in establishing cooperatives must first be discussed among the branch and key members. For example, ideological education, determining the method of share dividends, electing directors, equipping key members, establishing labor organizations and various systems, planning production, etc., should all be studied by the branch in advance, and then deliberated among the key members and members of the newly established cooperative, combining the intentions of the leadership with the village branch, the key members of the newly established cooperative, and the masses. In this way, on the one hand, the local branch and key members can participate in the leadership of the cooperative from the beginning and learn about the relevant policies and business of the cooperative, which is conducive to future leadership; on the other hand, it can avoid deviations caused by external work teams not understanding the situation and improperly handling problems.

　　黑龙江省建立农业生产合作社的基本经验
    中共黑龙江省委农村工作部
    为了取得建立农业生产合作社的经验，教育和训练建社干部，为全面展开一九五四年的建社工作奠定基础，黑龙江省二十八个县于一九五三年十一月初组织了大批干部（据二十八个县统计，共组织县区干部三六二人）进行了建社典型试验工作。新建成七十三个农业生产合作社。
    新建的农业生产合作社组织规模一般比较适宜。据绥化等二十二个县六十二个社统计，共有九四二户，平均每社十五六户左右，多者二十九户，少者十三四户。据海伦等六个县七个社统计，共有男劳力一七二个，女劳力一三二个，每社平均有男劳力二十四五个，另据海伦等六个县七个社统计，共有土地七五二·五垧，牲口一六八头（匹），大车三十四台，每个劳力平均土地四·三七垧，每头耕畜平均土地四·四六垧，每台车平均土地二十二垧多。
    这些新建社的组织基础也比较好。据海伦六个县七个社统计（建社前身为十个常年互助组），有九个组是二年以上的常年互助组，一个是一年以上的常年互助组。
    这些社的骨干力量也较多较强。据绥化等二十二个县六十二个社统计，有党员一一四名，团员一一一五名，群众积极分子二四五名，每社平均有骨干七名。
    在建社典型试验工作中，一般达到了“取得经验，教育骨干，推动其他工作”的目的，为更多建社打下了良好基础。各县取得的基本经验是：
    一、正确确定建社对象，细致检查建社条件，训练新社骨干，作好建社准备工作，是搞好建社工作的前提。挂锄后，各县均根据平日的了解，群众的要求和互助的基础，初步确定了建社对象，领导群众有计划地学习了社章，并以研究生产、参加老社骨干会议、组织参观等形式，培养了新社骨干，在组员中进行了宣传酝酿，初步明确了办社目的、社的性质和分配原则，澄清了一部分成员的糊涂思想，在正式建社前，一般均履行了“互助组提出要求，村研究请示，区委审查，县委批准”的手续。因此，一般建社对象都有比较成熟的条件和经过充分的思想酝酿，为建社打下了良好基础。
    二、充分进行思想教育，提高农民社会主义觉悟，是保证搞好建社工作的中心环节。
    首先要深入组内，帮助总结一年来的生产，进一步了解情况，做到心中有数。了解的内容主要是：组织基础，群众要求，现在和过去的生产和生活情况，骨干积极分子的情况，群众思想顾虑等。
    然后，要针对实际思想，结合具体事例，进行总路线教育。内容应是：（1）用本屯本组几年来生产生活上升的实例，联系苏联集体农民的生产生活的情况，进行党在过渡时期总路线的教育，提高群众对国家工业化、农业合作化的认识，鼓起向社会主义前进的劲头。很多地方进行了上述教育，提高了农民觉悟，激发了农民走好新道路的信心和决心。有的农民说：“过去给地主抗活吃穿不上，冬天老婆穿单裤，半截棉袄，黑天没被盖，土地改革后插组生产搞得好，生活一年比一年强，我一定相信党的话，参加社，搞好社，一步一步到社会主义。”（2）通过总结当地互助组合作社所显示出来的优越性，进行集体经营的优越性的教育，使农民进一步认识到农业合作社的目的和前途。（3）介绍当地原有社的入股分红原则办法，对农民进行关于农业合作社性质、有关政策、经营方针的教育，消除农民的误解和顾虑。（4）进行民主办社的教育，增强社员和骨干的主人感和责任感，和树立民主办社的风气。在教育方法方式上，应当灵活：个别访问，小型座谈，大会报告，小组讨论，展览会等等，都可以运用，对于不同对象，应召开不同的小型座谈会，如妇女、青年、老头、老太太座谈会等等。这样容易使人人了解建社意义，做到真正自觉自愿。
    经验证明：农民参加农业生产合作社是生产和生活上的一个严重改变；入社不入社，他们需要经过反复比较和复杂的思想斗争方能决定。因此，在建社整个过程中，都要不断地耐心地进行教育，逐步提高群众的社会主义觉悟。只有使农民大体上了解了社会主义远景和参加农业生产合作社的好处，他们才会积极地自觉地加入农业生产合作社。
    三、在进行了充分的思想教育的基础上，根据政策原则，结合当地情况，民主议定入股分红原则和办法，谨慎地、正确地处理入股分红问题，也是顺利建社和发展、巩固农业生产合作社的重要关键。这是农民注意最集中、讨论最热烈、争论最紧张的问题。处理这个问题的原则，必须根据农业生产合作社的半社会主义性质，坚持一定的按劳分红，同时给社员私人生产资料一定合理代价的原则。既要 尊重中农利益，也要避免变相的富农剥削，必须加强贫农和中农的团结，有领导、有准备地充分发扬民主，合理地确定各种制度。各地处理这些问题的情形如下：（1）土地：根据地级现实经营情况，参照当地租额分等吃租，死租活给；集体开荒，组员自愿带进社归社公有的，未参加开荒者给开荒者以合理报酬；划分等级的多少，要看单位产量大小，均应根据各地实际情况和农民意见，合理确定，防止一律化。个别地方地多且质量不好，社员自愿无代价地交社使用，如确系农民自愿的，不应制止；但一般不提倡。（2）耕畜：一般都采用了租用制，租额多少根据耕畜使用价值和信贷部利息，实行常年分等吃租；有的按季度评分，用马时记分，按分分粮。前者较普遍，后者占少数。（3）大农具：多数采取分等吃租和死租活给的办法。少数采取作价归公的办法。据绥化等十五个县三十八个社统计，大农具吃租的有二十九个社，折价归公的九个社。（4）马草料、籽种：多数是按马、按劳力平均入股，作为基金；也有的是春天借，秋后偿还，付一定利息。前者居多数，后者占少数。据三十八个社统计，平均入股的有三十三个社，春借秋还的有五个社。
    各地试办经验证明：在生产资料和投资问题的处理上，一方面必须教育社员根据农业生产合作社政策办事，另一方面必须真正发扬民主，根据当地具体情况、群众习惯和群众觉悟合理确定，不能强求划一。
    四、发动农民自愿报名入社，民主选举理事会，建立劳动组织、政治工作、财务会计工作制度，民主制订社章，是关系群众建立自己的集体经济组织的重大问题，必须发扬民主，细致作好。（1）发动报名入社，必须在全家酝酿成熟的基础上进行；可事先个别谈妥，而后公开报名登记，以示慎重。（2）民主选举干部是社员关心的大事，必须经过充分酝酿，确定干部条件（公道、能干、劳动好），然后民主选举。理事会成立后，即应明确分工，统一思想，研究社内工作。（3）根据社的大小，生产需要，技术高低，建立相适应的劳动组织，研究劳动日计算方法，民主议定各种分工责任制和可行的政治工作制度、财务制度。根据各地经验，要建立好财务工作制度，首先必须在全体社员中贯彻“增产节约、勤俭办社”的思想。一九五四年全省一般取消伙吃饭的办法，并规定农闲时间自己喂马，以减少浪费。
    五、建社工作过程是密切结合生产推动生产的过程，必须从生产入手，以生产结尾。开始时，总结小组生产，了解情况，进行教育；在建社过程中解决原小组存在的问题，推动生产行动。社建成，就计划和推动搞好冬季副业生产和作好春耕生产准备。进行教育，建立组织，确定制度，配备干部，都必须服从生产需要，并且不脱离当前生产行动。许多新建社贯彻了这个作法，效果很好。
    六、建社工作必须依靠和通过当地支部和骨干去进行。凡属建社重要步骤和较大问题的决定，首先要在支部和骨干中进行讨论。如思想教育、确定入股分红办法、选举理事、配备骨干、建立劳动组织和各种制度、计划生产等等，都应当事先经过支部研究，而后在新建社骨干和社员中进行酝酿，把领导意图和村支部、新建社骨干、群众结合起来。这样，一方面可以使当地支部、骨干一开始就参加社的领导，学会社的有关政策和业务，有利于今后领导；另一方面，可以避免外来工作队不了解情况、处理问题不当的偏差发生。
