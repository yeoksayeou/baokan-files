    Hebei Province - Several factories and mines overfulfilled their production plans for the first ten days of January.

    The Kailuan Zhao Ge Zhuang Coal Mine in Tangshan and the local state-run Zhangjiakou Flour Mill, as well as the Shijiazhuang Coking Plant, Repair Plant, Power Plant, and Knitting Mill, among others, completed or exceeded their production plans for the first ten days of January. The Kailuan Zhao Ge Zhuang Coal Mine consistently overfulfilled its coal production plan for the first ten days of the month by 108.57%, exceeding the actual output for the first ten days of December last year by 8.7%. Overall efficiency exceeded the state quota by 8.5%. The Zhangjiakou Flour Mill's output for the first ten days of the month exceeded the ten-day plan by 14.16%, electricity consumption was 9.56% lower than planned, the flour extraction rate was 0.93% higher than the planned rate for the same period in December last year, and the quality of the flour also met the state-defined standards. The Shijiazhuang Coking Plant overfulfilled the coke production plan for the first ten days of the month and reduced the ash content. The value of the extra coke produced and the reduction in ash content alone will allow the country to smelt an additional 818 tons of iron. The output of the Shijiazhuang Power Plant exceeded the ten-day plan by 6.73%, and the quality reached 99.97%.

    In order to comprehensively and evenly complete the January production tasks and ensure that the production level for the first quarter of this year is not lower than the production level for the fourth quarter of last year, these factories and mines strengthened the production leadership of various workshops at the beginning of January, overcoming the "breather" mentality of some employees after completing last year's production tasks. The Zhangjiakou Flour Mill convened an employee meeting on January 3 to mobilize all employees to continue to carry out the production increase and conservation campaign to ensure the completion of the January production tasks. During the competition, the factory not only ensured an attendance rate of over 98% but also carried out mass machine maintenance work. No accidents occurred in the first ten days of the month, and the ten-day production plan was completed comprehensively and evenly. In order to overcome the slackening mindset of the workers, the Kailuan Zhao Ge Zhuang Coal Mine repeatedly explained to the workers the great significance of completing the second annual production task of the country's first Five-Year Plan for the socialist industrialization of the motherland, which encouraged the workers' production enthusiasm. The workers of the 6931 working face in the fourth mining area carried out a production competition between teams. The workers of the 5832 working face of the mine completed 140% of the production plan for the first ten days of the month.

    河北部分厂矿一月上旬生产计划超额完成
    唐山开滦赵各庄煤矿和地方国营张家口面粉厂，石家庄炼焦厂、修理厂、动力厂、针织厂等厂矿，完成和超额完成了一月上旬生产计划。开滦赵各庄煤矿均衡地超额完成了上旬产煤计划的百分之一百零八点五七，超过去年十二月上旬实际产量百分之八点七，全员效率超过国家定额百分之八点五。张家口面粉厂上旬产量超过旬计划百分之十四点一六，电耗比计划降低百分之九点五六，出粉率比去年十二月份同期计划提高了百分之零点九三，面粉质量也达到国定指标。石家庄炼焦厂超额完成了上旬的焦炭生产计划，并降低了灰分，仅多产的焦炭和降低灰分的价值，就能为国家多炼八百一十八吨铁。石家庄动力厂产量超过旬计划百分之六点七三，质量达到百分之九十九点九七。
    为了全面均衡地完成一月份生产任务，保证今年第一季生产水平不低于去年第四季生产水平，这几个厂矿在一月初就加强了各车间的生产领导，克服了某些职工在完成去年生产任务后“松一口气”的思想。张家口面粉厂在一月三日召开了职工大会，发动全体职工继续开展增产节约竞赛，保证完成一月份生产任务。在竞赛中，该厂不仅保证出勤率达到百分之九十八以上，并开展群众性的机器维护工作，上旬没有发生任何事故，全面均衡地完成了上旬生产计划。开滦赵各庄煤矿为了克服职工群众的松劲思想，反复向职工讲解完成国家第一个五年计划第二个年度生产任务，对祖国社会主义工业化的重大意义，鼓舞了职工的生产积极性。第四采煤区六九三一掌工人开展了组与组的生产竞赛。该矿五八三二掌工人完成了上旬生产计划的百分之一百四十。　　　　（新华社）
