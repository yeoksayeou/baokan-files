    Yangjingdi Village in Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, in order to further utilize the mountains to develop production, has formulated an afforestation plan for greening barren mountains based on the village's land conditions.
    Yangjingdi Village has a total of 204 households, with 903 people, and a total land area of more than 21,600 mu, of which more than 18,000 mu are barren mountains. In recent years, under the active leadership of the local Party and government organs, 180 households and 831 people in the village have joined mutual aid and cooperative organizations, accounting for 92 percent of the total population. After organizing, agricultural production has increased, and work on closing hillsides for afforestation has been actively carried out, initially changing the appearance of the barren mountains. Currently, weeds have begun to grow on the sunny slopes, and the soil layer on the shady slopes is thicker, and it is now covered with hazel, vitex, and other shrubs, which play a role in conserving water and soil. In order to make full use of the mountains to develop production, the villagers have made a comprehensive plan for the more than 18,000 mu of mountain land: 4,000 mu for timber forests (pine, cypress, and oak forests) on the upper part of the shady slopes; more than 3,300 mu for sideline production forests such as oak, vitex, Forsythia, and Lespedeza on the upper part of the sunny slopes; 1,000 mu for fast-growing broad-leaved timber forests in areas farther from the village and with thicker soil; more than 4,900 mu for fruit tree forests near cultivated land and ditches; and 5,000 mu of grazing land reserved in the middle and lower parts of the mountains. This year, the village will first plant more than 1,200 mu of fruit trees and timber forests, with the entire plan to be gradually completed within seven years. In order to ensure the implementation of the plan, the village branch and village cadres are now organizing the masses to contract barren mountains, and carrying out "self-collection, self-cultivation, and self-planting" through mutual aid and cooperative organizations. The local people's government is also prepared to provide economic and technical assistance when necessary. According to various conditions, it is estimated that after fifteen years, the annual income from fruit trees and timber forests can reach 420 million yuan, and the average income per person will be 20 percent higher than the current agricultural income.

    山西省平顺县羊井底村订出荒山造林计划
    山西省平顺县羊井底村群众为了进一步利用山地发展生产，根据全村土地的情况，制订出绿化荒山的造林计划。
    羊井底村共有二百零四户，九百零三人，土地总面积二万一千六百多亩，其中荒山占一万八千多亩。几年来在当地党、政机关的积极领导下，全村已有一百八十户、八百三十一人参加了互助合作组织，占总人数的百分之九十二。组织起来后，提高了农业产量，并积极进行了封山育林工作，初步改变了荒山的面貌。目前阳坡山地已开始生长杂草，阴坡土层较厚，已长满了榛子、荆条等灌木，起到保持水土作用。全村群众为了充分利用山地发展生产，已把一万八千多亩山地作了全面的规划：在阴坡上部发展用材林（松、柏、橡树林）四千亩；在阳坡上部栽种橡树、荆条、连翘、胡枝子等副业生产林三千三百多亩；在离村较远、土层较肥厚处发展生长迅速的阔叶用材林一千亩；靠近耕地、沟渠附近发展果木林四千九百多亩；并在山的中、下部留牧地五千亩。今年首先栽植果木、用材林一千二百多亩，全部计划在七年内逐步完成。为了保证计划的贯彻，现在村支部和村干部正组织群众承领荒山，通过互助合作组织开展“自采、自育、自栽”工作。当地人民政府也准备在必要时给以经济上和技术上的帮助。根据各种条件估计，十五年后，果木、用材林每年共可收入四亿二千多万元，每人平均收入比现在的农业收入还多二成。
