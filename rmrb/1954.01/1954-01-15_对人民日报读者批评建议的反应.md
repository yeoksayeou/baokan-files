Response to Readers' Criticisms and Suggestions to People's Daily
Learning from the "Five Hundred Bolts of Cloth Incident" to Improve the Work of State Commercial Organs

Editor's Note: After our newspaper published the letter "Who Were the Five Hundred Bolts of Cloth Actually Issued To?" on November 3, 1953, many readers wrote in, expressing their anger at this incident of disregard for state property and demanding that the relevant units promptly investigate and handle it. Because the process of this matter was relatively tortuous, involving many units, and because the organizational structure and personnel of the relevant units changed during this period, it took a relatively long time to sort out the clues. Recently, the China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and its subordinate Jiangsu Provincial Company, Changshu Purchasing and Wholesale Store, China National Department Store and its subordinate Liaodong Provincial Company, Andong Regional Wholesale Station and other relevant units have successively sent replies to our newspaper. The letter from China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company and the inspection report of the joint inspection team formed by China National Department Store, the Commercial Department of Liaodong Provincial People's Government, and China National Department Store Liaodong Provincial Company for this incident are excerpted and published below. We believe that all relevant units should learn from this incident and further examine and improve their work.

Letter from China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company

In November 1952, our company notified its subordinate East China District Company (now changed to Shanghai Purchasing and Supply Station) to allocate cotton cloth to the Northeast District Company of China National Department Store according to the December plan of the same year. In addition to directly shipping most of this batch of cloth to the Northeast District Department Store, the East China District Company also notified the South Jiangsu Branch (which was merged with the North Jiangsu Branch into the Jiangsu Provincial Company in January) to ship the remaining cloth to department stores in various parts of the Northeast according to the opinions of Comrade Zhou Chengkui, representative of the Shanghai Branch of the Northeast Trade Department's Office in Beijing and Tianjin. Among them, the 500 bolts of cloth designated by Comrade Zhou Chengkui to be shipped to "Andong" (without specifying the unit to be allocated to) were allocated by the South Jiangsu Provincial Company notifying its subordinate Changshu City Company (now changed to Changshu Purchasing and Wholesale Store). Our company transferred the accounts for all the cotton cloth allocated to the Northeast (including the 500 bolts to Andong) to the Northeast District Company of China National Department Store in January 1953, and all of it was collected by the end of March.

After the Andong City Company of China National Department Store received the 500 bolts of cloth, it sent several inquiry letters. After receiving the first inquiry letter at the end of January, the Changshu City Company forwarded the letter to the Jiangsu Provincial Company without replying directly. In June, after receiving the second inquiry letter, it reported it to the Jiangsu Provincial Company and the East China District Company respectively. After receiving the inquiry letter forwarded by the Changshu City Company, the Jiangsu Provincial Company neither replied nor reported it to the higher authorities. After receiving an inquiry letter and a report from the Changshu City Company on this matter in June, the East China District Company replied to the Andong City Company of China National Department Store in early July (but the latter said that it had not received it, and our company has telegraphed the East China District Company to check the mailing situation) explaining the origin of the shipment and payment, and asked it to contact Comrade Zhou Chengkui directly for inquiries. When it received another inquiry letter in mid-July, it did not reply again. After receiving the inquiry letter in August, our company only verbally informed the representative of the Jiangsu Provincial Company who came to Beijing for a meeting to go back and check and report because the comrades in charge did not pay enough attention to it. At the end of September, when the Supervision Office of the Ministry of Commerce of the Central People's Government came to inquire, our company wrote to the Jiangsu Provincial Company to urge them to handle it, but still did not make a serious effort to supervise it. It was not until November 3, when the People's Daily exposed this incident, that our company began to seriously investigate it.

Based on the above facts, we believe that the reason for this incident is that, in addition to Comrade Zhou Chengkui's failure to specify the unit to be allocated to, the main reason is that the East China District Company and its second-level companies below did not understand the situation of commercial organizations in the Northeast region, and did not investigate the unclear receiving unit, but "assumed" that the receiving unit was "Andong Department Store." This careless and irresponsible work style must be resolutely corrected in the future.

In terms of attitude towards inquiry letters, our company only made arrangements without checking, the East China District Company lacked the spirit of being responsible to the end, the Jiangsu Provincial Company simply ignored it, and the Changshu City Company pushed the matter to the superior company. These bureaucratic work styles caused the bad consequences of the problem not being solved for a long time. We are determined to learn from this lesson and completely change our work attitude.

Inspection Report of the Joint Inspection Team

In early January 1953, the Changshu City Company of China National Cotton Yarn and Cloth Company allocated 500 bolts of cloth to Andong City, and the "receiving unit" column was filled in as "Andong Department Store." According to past practice, the Andong City Joint Transportation Station (hereinafter referred to as the Joint Transportation Station) estimated that it might be the Andong Regional Wholesale Station of China National Department Store (hereinafter referred to as the Wholesale Station), and notified Comrade Wang Zhaoxiang of the Storage and Transportation Section of the Warehouse Company under the station to pick up the goods. Wang Zhaoxiang went to the station and refused to pick up the goods after seeing the "receiving unit." The Joint Transportation Station contacted the Andong City Company of China National Department Store (hereinafter referred to as the City Company), and the answer was also "no." By January 26, no one had come to pick up the batch of cloth, and the Joint Transportation Station urged the City Company to pick it up. After the City Company picked it up, it inquired with the Yarn and Cloth Section of the Wholesale Station and the local Liaodong Provincial Company of China National Department Store and its subordinate Andong County Store, but the answers were all "no."

In fact, this batch of cloth was sent to the Wholesale Station. As early as the end of December 1952, the Wholesale Station received part of the documents for this batch of cloth forwarded by the Shanghai Branch of the Northeast Trade Department's Office in Beijing and Tianjin (hereinafter referred to as the Shanghai Branch). Comrade Zhao Ge of the station sent a letter to the Shanghai Branch to inquire because the documents were incomplete. In late February, the Shanghai Branch replied that the goods had been shipped, and said that the receiving unit might have been written incorrectly, and asked the station to contact the Joint Transportation Station. Zhao Ge believed that checking the goods was not "within the scope of his duties" and gave the letter to Sun Bingfang, the section chief of the Storage and Transportation Section of the Warehouse Company. After reading the letter, Sun returned it to Zhao Ge, and no one paid attention to it afterwards.

In mid-March, during the anti-bureaucracy struggle in the station, Zhao Ge raised the issue of not receiving the 500 bolts of cloth. Manager Du of the station asked the Transportation Section (formerly the Storage and Transportation Section of the Warehouse Company, but Sun Bingfang was no longer in the section) and the Finance Section to check. However, neither the Transportation Section nor the Finance Section made a serious check. Later, Manager Du said at the "Anti-Bureaucracy Summary Meeting" that the opinions raised by Zhao Ge had been checked and "this did not happen," and that "these 500 bolts of cloth came in February and have already been sold out."

Based on the above facts, we believe that the responsibility for the long-term failure to find the owner of the 500 bolts of cloth after they were sent to Andong City should mainly be borne by the Wholesale Station. Through the inspection of this incident, we found that the station's operation and management work has been in a state of chaos for a long time: the system is unsound, the responsibilities are unclear, and the accounts are chaotic. This is inseparable from the bureaucratic work style of the station's leadership. Therefore, dereliction of duty incidents in the station have occurred continuously, and the 500 bolts of cloth incident is just one of them. Now, in addition to reviewing this mistake, the leading cadres of the station have also launched all employees to check the work in 1953, starting on December 15, in order to improve the system and improve future work.

    对人民日报读者批评建议的反应
    接受“五百匹布事件”的教训  改进国家商业机关的工作
    编者按：一九五三年十一月三日本报刊载了“五百匹布究竟是发给谁的”一信以后，很多读者纷纷来信，对这一漠视国家财产的事件表示愤怒，要求有关单位从速检查处理。由于这件事情的经过比较曲折，牵涉的单位比较多，而且在这期间，有关单位的组织机构和人事有变动，因此费了较长时间才查清头绪。最近中国花纱布公司及其所属江苏省公司、常熟采购批发商店，中国百货公司及其所属辽东省公司、安东地区批发站等有关单位已先后给本报寄来了复信。现将中国花纱布公司的来信以及中国百货公司、辽东省人民政府商业厅、中国百货公司辽东省公司为这一事件而组成的联合检查小组的检查报告分别摘要发表在下面。我们认为，各有关单位还应当接受这一事件的教训，进一步检查和改进工作。
    中国花纱布公司的来信
    一九五二年十一月间，我公司通知所属华东区公司（现已改为上海采购供应站）根据同年十二月份计划向中国百货公司东北区公司调拨棉布。华东区公司除将这批布的大部分直接拨运到东北区百货公司外，并通知苏南分公司（已在一月间与苏北分公司合并为江苏省公司）把其余布匹按照东北区贸易部驻京津办事处上海分处代表周成魁同志意见，分运东北各地百货公司。其中周成魁同志指定运往“安东”（未写明应拨交单位）的五百匹布就由苏南省公司通知所属常熟市公司（现已改为常熟采购批发商店）调拨。所有调拨给东北的这批棉布（包括安东的五百匹在内）的货款，我公司在一九五三年一月间将账划转中国百货公司东北区公司，到三月底全部收清。
    中国百货公司安东市公司收到五百匹布后，发出了好几封查询信。常熟市公司在一月底接到第一封查询信后，将这信转报江苏省公司，而未直接作复；六月间接到第二封查询信，又分别上报江苏省公司和华东区公司。江苏省公司接到常熟市公司转来查询信后，既不答复，也未向上级汇报。华东区公司在六月间接到一封查询信和常熟市公司关于此事的报告后，在七月初就函复中国百货公司安东市公司（但据后者说并未收到，我公司已电华东区公司检查发函情况）说明发货收款原委，并请迳与周成魁同志联系查询；七月中旬再接到查询信时，就没再作复。我公司在八月间接到查询信后，由于经办同志重视不够，只面告了当时来京开会的江苏省公司的代表回去检查后上报。九月底中央人民政府商业部监察室前来查询时，我公司才去信江苏省公司催办，但仍未抓紧督促。直到十一月三日人民日报揭发了这一事件以后，我公司才抓紧进行了检查。
    根据上述事实，我们认为，造成这一事件的原因，除周成魁同志没有写明应该拨交的单位外，主要是华东区公司及其以下二级公司既不明白东北地区商业机构的情况，又对受货单位不明的问题不加查究，就“想当然”地把受货单位写做“安东百货公司”。这种粗枝大叶、不负责任的作风今后必须切实改正。
    在对待查询信的态度上，我公司是只有布置而不作检查，华东区公司是缺乏负责到底的精神，江苏省公司是根本置之不理，常熟市公司是推给上级公司了事。这些官僚主义作风，造成了长期没有解决问题的恶果。我们决心接受这一教训，彻底改变我们的工作态度。
    联合检查小组的检查报告
    一九五三年一月初，中国花纱布公司常熟市公司拨到安东市五百匹布，“受货单位”一栏里填的是“安东百货公司”。安东市联运站（以下简称联运站）根据历来情况，估计可能是中国百货公司安东地区批发站（以下简称批发站）的，就通知该站所属仓库公司储运股王兆祥同志去提货。王兆祥前往一看“受货单位”就拒绝领取。联运站又和中国百货公司安东市公司（以下简称市公司）联系，回答也说“不是”。直到一月二十六日，这批布还没有人来取，联运站就催市公司一定取去。市公司取回后，曾向批发站纱布科和当地的中国百货公司辽东省公司及其所属安东县商店查询，但回答都说“不是”。
    其实，这批布是发给批发站的。早在一九五二年十二月底，批发站就接到了东北贸易部驻京津办事处上海分处（以下简称上海分处）转来这批布的单据的一部分。该站赵革同志因为单据不全曾给上海分处去信查询。二月下旬，上海分处回信中曾说起货已运来，并说可能把受货单位写错，叫该站去联运站联系。赵革认为查货不是“本职范围内的工作”，就把信交给仓库公司储运股孙炳方股长；孙股长看完后就把信还给赵革，以后，谁也没再过问这件事。
    三月中旬，在该站反官僚主义斗争中，赵革对没有收到五百匹布的问题提出了意见。该站杜经理叫运输科（即原仓库公司储运股，但孙炳方已不在该科）和财务科查对。但运输科和财务科都没认真检查。以后杜经理在“反官僚主义总结大会”上就说：赵革提的意见经过检查“没有这回事儿”，“这五百匹布在二月份就来了，现在早就卖光了”。
    根据上述事实，我们认为这五百匹布发到安东市后长期找不到货主的责任，主要应由批发站担负。通过对这一事件的检查，我们发现该站的经营管理工作长期处于混乱状态：制度不健全、责任不明确、账目混乱。这是和该站领导工作的官僚主义作风分不开的。因此，该站工作中的失职事件不断发生，五百匹布事件只不过是其中一件。现在，该站领导干部除已对这一错误进行检讨外，并已在十二月十五日开始发动全体职工检查一九五三年度工作，以健全制度，改进今后工作。
