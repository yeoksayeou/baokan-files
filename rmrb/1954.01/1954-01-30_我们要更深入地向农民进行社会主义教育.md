We Must Conduct More In-Depth Socialist Education for Farmers
中共嘉定县委书记　潘林儒
    Party Secretary of the Jiading County Committee, Pan Linru

　　If socialism does not occupy the vast rural areas, capitalism will inevitably do so. From past practical work, especially from the recent general line propaganda and surplus grain purchase, we have gained a relatively deep understanding of this point. We deeply recognize that the Party's task in the current rural work lies in educating the peasants on the one hand that the capitalist road is a dead end and cannot be taken; and on the other hand, leading the peasants to take the socialist road, because peasants are "accustomed" to the old road, while they are unfamiliar with the new road.

　　In the four years since liberation, under the leadership of the Communist Party and the People's Government, farmers in Jiading County, Jiangsu Province, have completed land reform, carried out the mutual aid and cooperation movement, and production has increased year by year. In the past, "rice overflowing from two stone measures and cotton filling a carrying pole" were only individual examples, but now this has become a common phenomenon. The lives of most farmers have improved. In the past, it was "black belly when wheat is harvested," and they ate "coarse food more than fine, thin porridge more than thick"; they wore "new clothes for three years, old clothes for three years, patching and mending for another three years." Now, they eat "more dry food than porridge, more fine food than coarse"; the situation in clothing has also changed, as some farmers say: "After having homespun cloth, they want fine cloth; after having fine cloth, they want twill cloth; after having twill cloth, they still want woolen fabric." In Taoli Village, Zhaojia Township, Nanxiang District, more than a dozen women each made a pair of woolen pants and a twill Lenin suit last Spring Festival.

　　However, because our socialist education for farmers and socialist transformation of agriculture work has not been done enough, capitalist spontaneous tendencies have developed considerably in many villages, and the phenomenon of class differentiation has occurred. For example, in Huating Township, Xuhang District, from after land reform to the autumn of 1953, there were 24 households selling land, accounting for 4.4 percent of the 541 households in the township. The family of poor peasant Jiang Ru'e sold all seven mu of land and the house they were allocated during land reform and became destitute due to a small labor force and frequent illnesses in the family. A few farmers, however, engaged in exploitative activities and made a fortune. Many village cadres said: "As the saying goes, 'land changes hands every ten years,' if we do not guide the peasants to follow the general line, I am afraid that it will not take ten years before we return to the old road."

　　In places where the Party has strengthened its leadership over mutual aid and cooperation, socialist factors are constantly growing. Take our pilot Yulong Agricultural Production Cooperative as an example. The 16 households that joined the cooperative had a total of 125.9 mu of land (some of which was rented), one head of cattle, one boat, and some plows and harrows, and their lives were very poor. For example, the family of poor peasant Guan Yundi, with five members, only cultivated four mu of land before land reform, and the yield was extremely low. The grain and firewood they harvested each year were not enough to eat and use, and they often borrowed rice and firewood from the east and west when they ran out of food and fuel. There were six households like this that were often in difficulty. After land reform, two mutual aid teams were formed, and in 1952, they were transformed into an agricultural production cooperative. After being organized, they improved farming techniques, and crop yields increased year by year. Last year, the cooperative averaged 724 jin of rice per mu, 164 jin of improved cotton per mu, and 326 jin of wheat per mu. The average income of each member, converted into grain, reached 1,084.5 jin. The means of production also increased year by year, and in terms of public property, they added one head of cattle, one boat, and one windmill. Members did not worry about food or clothing, and every family had surplus grain. For example, Zhu Yuanqi, a member, had not made new clothes for six years. He borrowed clothes from others when he got married. Now he has made a new cotton-padded coat and recently bought ten jin of pork for the Spring Festival. He said to the cadres in the cooperative: "In the past, I didn't drink or smoke, and my shirts and trousers were not even connected; now that I have joined the cooperative, life is getting better and better. I made a new cotton-padded coat this year, and I will make a new overcoat next year."

　　In the past two months, Jiading County has used methods such as accounting, recalling, and comparing to vigorously promote the general line to farmers in rural areas, and the socialist atmosphere in rural areas has therefore increased unprecedentedly. The vast number of farmers understand that to get rid of poverty, they can only take the socialist road; they realize that the small-scale peasant economy is a "chive life," "duck watching boat," "everyone loses, a few get rich," and "root of poverty," which cannot make everyone prosperous, and that "the old road is a dead end, and it must not be taken." They also realized that although their production and lives have improved in the past four years, "it is many times better than before liberation, but it is still far behind the Soviet Union," and they must "look forward" and engage in large-scale production.

　　We also educated the peasants through practical examples, explaining the benefits of mutual aid and cooperation. Our pilot agricultural production cooperative is an example. In 1953, the yields of wheat, cotton, and rice were generally 20 to 44 percent higher than those of mutual aid teams, and more than 36 percent higher than those of local individual farmers. The average income of members increased by 114.2 percent compared with 1952, showing great superiority. This living example powerfully persuaded the surrounding farmers, making them realize that agricultural production cooperatives are the only way out for farmers. Farmers near the agricultural production cooperative saw that the cooperative had few households and little land, but sold a lot of grain, and they all envied and said: "Agricultural production cooperatives are really good." Hundreds of mutual aid teams throughout the county have asked to join agricultural production cooperatives. In Malu Township, farmers saw the superiority of the cooperative, and thirteen mutual aid teams asked to set up cooperatives, and 146 farmers asked to join. Lu Pei, a farmer from Lujiazhai, said: "If you don't join the cooperative, production will definitely not be good, and life will not improve. Only by joining the cooperative can everyone be of one mind, output will increase steadily, and life will get better and better." Many mutual aid teams are settling old accounts and preparing to join the cooperative. Facts show that as long as our Party strengthens its leadership, the peasants will respond to the Party's call and take the socialist road.

　　我们要更深入地向农民进行社会主义教育
    中共嘉定县委书记　潘林儒
    农村的广大阵地，假如社会主义不去占领，资本主义必然会去占领。从以往的实际工作中，特别是从此次总路线宣传和收购余粮中，我们对这一点有了比较深刻的体会。我们深刻认识到：党在目前农村工作中的任务，就在于一方面教育农民：资本主义道路是走不得的，它是一条死路；一方面要带领农民走社会主义道路，因为，走旧道路，农民是“习惯”的，而对新道路，农民是生疏的。
    解放四年多来，江苏省嘉定县的农民在共产党和人民政府领导下，完成了土地改革，开展了互助合作运动，生产一年比一年提高。过去，“稻满双石棉满担”只是个别的例子，现在这已经成为普遍的现象。农民的生活绝大部分都上升了。过去是“麦上场，黑肚肠”、“吃粗吃稀”，穿的是“新三年，旧三年，缝缝补补着三年”。现在，吃的是“干多稀少、细多粗少”；穿着方面的情况也改变了，正如有的农民所说：“有了土布想细布，有了细布又想斜纹布，有了斜纹布还想呢。”南翔区赵家乡桃李村有十多个妇女，去年春节每人做了一条呢裤，一件斜纹布的列宁装。
    但由于我们对农民的社会主义教育和对农业的社会主义改造工作做得不够，不少村子资本主义自发趋势有了相当的发展，发生了阶级分化的现象。如徐行区华亭乡从土地改革后到一九五三年秋，出卖土地的就有二十四户，占全乡五百四十一户的百分之四点四。贫农江如峨家，由于劳动力少，家里人又多病，把土地改革中分到的七亩田和房子全部卖光，成为赤贫。而少数农民则进行剥削活动，发了财。很多村干部说：“俗语说，‘十年田地转三村’，假如不引导农民照着总路线走，恐怕不要十年，又要回到老路了。”
    在党加强了对互助合作领导的地方，社会主义因素不断增长。就拿我们试办的裕农农业生产合作社说吧，入社的十六户人家，共有田一百二十五亩九分（其中一部分是租田），有一头耕牛、一只船和部分犁耙，生活十分贫苦。如贫农管云弟家五口人，土地改革前只种四亩田，产量极低，每年打下的粮食和柴草，不够吃用，往往大熟接不上小熟；断粮绝草时，只好东借米、西借柴。像这种“前吃后空”的人家有六户，经常闹困难的四户。土地改革后，成立了两个互助组，一九五二年又转为农业生产合作社。组织起来后，改进了耕作技术，作物产量年年增加。去年，社内水稻平均每亩收到七百二十四斤，改良棉每亩收到一百六十四斤，小麦平均每亩收三百二十六斤。每个社员的平均收入，折合粮食达一千零八十四斤半。生产资料也逐年增加，在公有财产方面增加了耕牛一头、船一只、风车一部。社员不愁吃，不愁穿，家家有余粮。如社员朱元其，六年没有做过新衣，结婚时向别人借衣服穿，现在做了新棉袄，最近又买了十斤猪肉过春节。他对社内干部说：“过去不吃酒、不吸烟，短衫裤子不连牵；现在办了合作社，日子越过越好，今年做了新棉袄，明年还做新大衣。”
    近两个月来，嘉定县在农村中用算账、回忆、对比等方法，向农民大张旗鼓地宣传了总路线，农村中社会主义空气因而空前增长。广大农民懂得了要摆脱贫困，只有走社会主义的道路；认识到小农经济是“韭菜命”、“看鸭船”、“大家败几家发”、“穷根子”，不能使大家富裕，“旧道路是死路一条，万万走不得”。他们也认识到，四年多来自己的生产、生活虽有了提高，“比解放前强了好几倍，但比苏联还差得远”，一定要“向前看”，搞大生产。
    我们还通过实际的例子，教育农民，说明互助合作的好处。我们试办的农业生产合作社，就是一个例子，一九五三年小麦、棉花、水稻产量一般均比互助组增产百分之二十到四十四，比当地单干农民高出百分之三十六以上，社员平均收入比一九五二年增加百分之一百十四点二，显示了很大的优越性。这个活的榜样有力地说服了周围的农民，使他们认识到农业生产合作社是农民的唯一出路。农业生产合作社附近的农民看到农业生产合作社户数少、田少，而粮食卖得多，都羡慕地说：“农业生产合作社确实是好。”全县已有几百个互助组纷纷要求参加农业生产合作社。在马陆乡，农民看到了合作社的优越性，要求办社的互助组就有十三个，要求参加的农民有一百四十六户。陆家宅的农民陆培说：“不参加合作社，生产一定搞不好，生活也提不高，参加了合作社才能大家一条心，产量节节高，日子越是过的好。”不少互助组正在结清旧账，准备入社条件。事实说明：只要我们党加强领导，农民一定会响应党的号召，走社会主义的道路。
