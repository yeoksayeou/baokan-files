Respected Chairman Mao:

	Under the glorious illumination of the general line and general task of the transition period, we welcome the arrival of 1954 with boundless hope and report to you the production achievements of our collective farm in its first year of establishment.

	Following your instructions, we began to organize in 1947, developing from mutual aid teams to agricultural production cooperatives. Over the past few years, we have achieved great success in production, improved our living standards, and raised the ideological awareness of our members. In the spring of 1953, based on the needs of production development and the demands of all members, we established the collective farm. Throughout the year, we actively studied advanced Soviet experiences, promoted the advanced experiences of Zhaoyuan and Cui Zhusong, and launched a production struggle to increase grain production.

	During the year's production process, summer weeding was the most arduous period. Because at that time, there were many tasks such as transplanting seedlings, thinning seedlings, weeding, and applying fertilizer. During last year's summer weeding, the entire village had to cultivate 87 hectares of paddy and dry land, requiring 4,470 workdays, but the entire village only had 78 male and female laborers. What to do? We are the cooperative farmers of New China, and we must never bow our heads in the face of difficulties. Under the leadership of Comrade Jin Shilong and the farm management committee, all villagers were mobilized to transplant seedlings and thin seedlings during the day, and apply fertilizer in the evenings and during rainy periods. We also ate two meals a day in the fields. We also implemented the advanced experience of Soviet farmers—the work quota system—which greatly boosted the labor enthusiasm of all members. As a result, we overcame the difficulties of labor shortage during the summer weeding period, and in the autumn harvest, we achieved careful cutting, careful pulling, and careful threshing, achieving a bumper harvest.

	Our victory over various disasters to strive for a bumper harvest fully demonstrates the superiority of the collective farm. The entire village's 33 hectares of paddy fields yielded an average of 8,880 jin of rice per hectare; the 32.7 hectares of dry land yielded an average of 3,437 jin of grain per hectare. In 1953, the entire village harvested a total of 397,400 jin of grain, an increase of 21.9 percent compared to 1952. Among them, 1.5 hectares of paddy fields yielded a total of 25,500 jin of rice, creating a record of high and abundant production; the average yield of 15 hectares of high-yielding paddy fields reached 11,000 jin per hectare. Sixteen hectares of high-yielding dry land yielded an average of 5,000 jin of millet or 4,500 jin of soybeans per hectare. In addition, the income from industrial raw material crops in the entire village was 12 million yuan, and the income from animal husbandry was 21 million yuan. The income of the villagers has increased compared to last year, and the farm has also obtained favorable conditions for expanded reproduction.

	With the development of production and the improvement of material life, the cultural life and political awareness of the villagers are also increasing day by day. Now, most of the villagers can understand the Northeast Korean People's Daily and New Rural Areas and other magazines. The thinking of some young villagers who were not content with agricultural production in the past has also been overcome, and now everyone is wholeheartedly working hard to build a socialist collective farm. Recently, after we studied the Party's general line and general task in the transition period, all villagers further recognized our bright future. Under the glorious illumination of the general line, we are determined to increase grain production and vigorously support the industrialization of the motherland. In addition to selecting 70,000 jin of good grain to pay public grain, we also sold all the surplus grain of 156,000 jin to the state.

	In order to continue to do a good job in the production of the collective farm and support national economic construction, we have sent nine villagers to the mountains to engage in the timber industry, and the remaining villagers are engaged in the production of weaving straw bags in winter, striving to increase more income and make material preparations for the large-scale production in 1954. We plan to increase grain production by 20 percent in 1954 compared to 1953. Now all villagers are actively working towards this goal.

    黎明集体农庄向毛主席报告生产成就
    一九五三年比一九五二年增产粮食百分之二十一点九
    敬爱的毛主席：
    在过渡时期总路线、总任务的光辉照耀下，我们怀着无限的希望迎接一九五四年的来临，并向您报告我们集体农庄成立第一年的生产成就。
    我们遵照您的指示，从一九四七年开始组织起来，从互助组发展为农业生产合作社，几年来生产上获得了很大的成就，生活得到了改善，社员的思想觉悟也提高了。一九五三年春天，根据生产发展的需要和全体社员的要求，我们成立了集体农庄。一年中，我们积极学习苏联先进经验，推广了肇源和崔竹松的先进经验，展开了为增产粮食的生产斗争。
    一年的生产过程中，夏锄是最艰苦的一段。因为那时，插苗、间苗、锄草、追肥等工作很多，去年夏锄时，全庄要铲八十七垧水旱田地，需要四千四百七十个劳动日，但全庄只有七十八个男女劳动力。怎么办呢？我们是合作化的新中国的农民，绝不能在困难面前低头。在金时龙同志和农庄管理委员会的领导下，全体庄员动员起来，白天插苗、间苗，晚间和下雨时间进行了追肥，每天两顿饭也在地里吃。我们还实行了苏联农民的先进经验——工作定额制，大大鼓舞了全体社员的劳动热情。结果，我们克服了夏锄期间劳动力不足的困难，并在秋收中做到了细割、细拉、细打，取得了丰收。
    我们战胜种种灾害争取丰收的情况，充分表现了集体农庄的优越性。全庄三十三垧水田，每垧平均收八千八百八十斤稻子；三十二垧七亩旱田，每垧平均打三千四百三十七斤粮食。一九五三年全庄共打粮食三十九万七千四百斤，比一九五二年增产百分之二十一点九。其中一垧半水田共打了二万五千五百斤稻子，创造了高额丰产纪录；十五垧丰产水田每垧平均产量达到了一万一千斤。有十六垧丰产旱田每垧平均产谷子五千斤或大豆四千五百斤。此外，全庄工业原料作物的收入有一千二百万元，牧畜业的收入有二千一百万元。庄员收入比去年增加了，农庄也得到了扩大再生产的有利条件。
    随着生产的发展和物质生活的提高，庄员们的文化生活和政治觉悟也日益提高。现在绝大部分庄员都能看懂东北朝鲜人民报和新农村等杂志。过去有些青年庄员不安心农业生产的思想也得到了克服，现在大家都全心全意地为建设好社会主义的集体农庄而努力。最近我们学习了党在过渡时期的总路线总任务之后，全体庄员们进一步认清了我们的幸福前途。在总路线的光辉照耀下，我们决心增产粮食大力支援祖国的工业化。我们除了选择好粮七万斤交纳公粮外，又把全部余粮十五万六千斤都卖给了国家。
    为了继续搞好集体农庄的生产，支援国家经济建设，我们已经派了九名庄员到山里搞木业，其余庄员在冬季都进行织草袋的生产，争取增加更多的收入，给一九五四年的大生产做好物质准备。我们计划一九五四年的粮食要比一九五三年增产百分之二十。现在全体庄员正为着达到这个目标而积极努力。
