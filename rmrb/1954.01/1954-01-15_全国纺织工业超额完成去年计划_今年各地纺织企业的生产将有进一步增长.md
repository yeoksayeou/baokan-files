    National Textile Industry Exceeds Last Year's Plan
    Production of Textile Enterprises in Various Regions Will Further Increase This Year
    [By Our Correspondent] National state-owned and centrally-administered joint state-private textile enterprises comprehensively overfulfilled the state production plan for 1953, and accumulated huge construction funds for the state.
    According to statistics from the Ministry of Textile Industry regarding actual completion figures, the annual completion numbers for major products were: cotton yarn 102.77, cotton cloth 103.04, printed and dyed cloth 106, woolen fabrics such as serge and melton 142.61, and gunny sacks 105.06. The total value of production last year exceeded the plan by 3.4 percent, adding more than 917 billion yuan in wealth for the country. The quality of major products also improved, with the national average rate of first-grade cotton cloth exceeding the planned target. The state-owned textile industry also fulfilled its profit delivery plan for 1953 very well; the amount exceeding the plan alone would be more than enough to build a new 50,000-spindle textile mill.
    The staff and workers of the seven textile administrative bureaus affiliated to the Ministry of Textile Industry, including East China, Qingdao, Tianjin, Northeast, Central South, Southwest, and Northwest, demonstrated enthusiasm and creativity in carrying out the production increase and economy campaign to complete the 1953 national plan, putting forward many rationalization proposals, increasing production, and saving a great deal of funds. For example, the staff and workers of the state-owned Shanghai No. 1 Printing and Dyeing Factory put forward 1,250 rationalization proposals from January to mid-November 1953. Calculated based on the value of these proposals, they saved the state 2.1 billion yuan in one year. Among the rationalization proposals put forward by the workers in various factories, many are worthy of promotion and have great creative value. For example, engineer Wang Jiaxiang, technicians Ai Wenqin, Li Xianliang, and veteran workers of the Tianjin State-owned No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory jointly created a "fiber impurity separation machine" during the production increase and economy campaign. Using this machine to process cotton waste can effectively separate impurities, short fibers, and effective fibers from the waste, which can save cotton, reduce costs, and improve the quality of cotton yarn. According to preliminary calculations, the use of this machine in the relatively small State-owned Tianjin No. 6 Cotton Textile Factory can save cotton worth more than 400 million yuan a year.
    In 1954, the production of textile enterprises in various regions will further increase. The North China Textile Administrative Bureau had already completed the compilation of various plans for this year in December last year. The total planned output value for this year will exceed the actual completed total output value of last year by 5.39 percent. In order to further meet the needs of the people, Tianjin's cotton textile factories will start weaving new products such as poplin, khaki, and venetian cloth this year, in addition to continuing to produce twill and serge. The Tianjin Textile Machinery Manufacturing Factory has determined its 1954 plan, according to which the output of the factory's machines will increase by more than 100 percent compared to last year, and the total output value will be equivalent to 181.03 percent of last year. In order to supply the urban and rural people with more cloth, the cotton textile factories under the Southwest Textile Administrative Bureau plan to produce an amount equivalent to 374.59 percent of the actual production last year, and the output of the famous Sichuan silk and various silk fabrics will also increase.
    This year, two newly built state-owned cotton textile mills can be put into full-year production (last year, these two mills were only put into production for half a year); four newly built state-owned cotton textile mills can be put into production one after another from the second quarter. At the same time, the production of spindles will be increased in Shanghai, Northeast, and other places this year. In addition, with the labor enthusiasm and wisdom of the vast number of staff and workers in the national textile enterprises, it can be guaranteed that the production of China's state-owned textile industry will have a further increase this year, which will better meet the needs of the people.

### 全国纺织工业超额完成去年计划  今年各地纺织企业的生产将有进一步增长

    全国纺织工业超额完成去年计划
    今年各地纺织企业的生产将有进一步增长
    【本报讯】全国国营和中央所属的公私合营纺织企业，全面超额完成了一九五三年国家生产计划，并为国家积累了巨额的建设资金。
    据中央纺织工业部对实际完成数字的统计，主要产品的全年完成数：棉纱一百零二点七七，棉布一百零三点零四，印染布一百零六，呢绒哔叽等精纺、粗纺织品一百四十二点六一，麻袋一百零五点零六。去年生产总值比计划超过百分之三点四，全年共为国家增产了九千一百七十多亿元的财富。主要产品的质量也有提高，其中棉布的全国平均正布率已超过计划指标。一九五三年国营纺织工业上缴利润计划也完成得很好，只是超额的部分，就可新建一个五万锭子的纺织厂而有余。
    中央纺织工业部所属华东、青岛、天津、东北、中南、西南、西北等七个纺织管理局的职工，在开展增产节约竞赛，完成一九五三年国家计划中，发挥了积极性和创造性，提出了许多的合理化建议，提高了生产，节约了大量资金。如国营上海第一印染厂的职工，在一九五三年一月到十一月中，提出了一千二百五十件合理化建议，按可计算价值的建议来算，一年就可为国家节约二十一亿元。在各厂职工们提出的合理化建议中，有许多是值得推广和创造价值很大的。如天津国营第六棉纺织厂工程师王家祥、技术人员艾文钦、李宪梁和老工人等在增产节约运动中，共同创造了“纤维杂质分离机”，用这种机器来处理落棉，可以有效地分清落棉中的杂质、短纤维和有效纤维，这样既能节约用棉、降低成本，又能提高棉纱质量。据初步计算，这种机器在规模较小的国营天津棉纺六厂采用后，一年所节约的用棉就可值四亿余元。
    一九五四年，各地纺织企业的生产将有更进一步的增长。华北纺织管理局在去年十二月就已将今年各项计划编制完成。今年的计划总产值将比去年实际完成的总产值超过百分之五点三九。为了进一步满足人民的需要，天津各棉纺织厂今年除继续生产斜纹布和哔叽以外，将开始织造府绸、卡叽布、直贡呢等新产品。天津纺织机械制造厂一九五四年计划确定，全厂机台产量将较去年提高一倍以上，总产值相当于去年的百分之一百八十一点零三。西南纺织管理局所属棉纺织各厂为供应城乡人民更多的布匹，今年计划生产的数字相当于去年实际生产数的百分之三百七十四点五九，有名的四川绸子和各种丝织品的产量也有增加。
    今年，有两个新建的国营棉纺织厂可以全年投入生产（去年这两个厂只投入生产半年）；有四个新建的国营棉纺织厂从第二季度起即可先后投入生产，同时在上海、东北等地今年将增加纱锭的生产，加上全国纺织企业广大职工的劳动热忱和智慧，因此就能保证我国的国营纺织工业生产，在今年将有更进一步的增长，将可以更好的满足人民的需要。
