　　Northwest Ethnic Groups Subscribe to Government Bonds to Support Construction

[By Our Correspondent] People of all ethnic groups and all sectors in the Northwest region are enthusiastically subscribing to the 1954 National Economic Construction Bonds.

Workers and staff of industrial, mining, and construction units in the Northwest region are enthusiastically taking the lead in subscribing to government bonds to accumulate more construction funds for the country. All the workers and staff of the thirty-five factories and enterprises in Xi'an city, under the leadership and mobilization of the enterprise Party committees, began subscribing to government bonds one after another on January 7th. Many units completed their original estimated figures in a short period. According to incomplete statistics, by January 16th, the amount of government bonds subscribed to by the workers and staff of sixteen factories had reached 1.71 billion yuan. Workers fighting day and night against wind and snow in the Wushaoling section of the Lanzhou-Xinjiang Railway are enthusiastically subscribing to government bonds. According to preliminary statistics, the workers and staff of the Fifth Engineering Section, the Third and Twenty-third Joint Operations Teams, have already subscribed to more than 1.18 billion yuan in government bonds. Shop employees in Xi'an, Baoji, Sanyuan and other places are also actively subscribing to government bonds according to their means. Farmers in various parts of the Northwest are also subscribing to government bonds to support industrial construction. Yang Xueyi, a farmer from Zhongchuan Township, Baoding District, Gaolan County, Gansu Province, saved 500,000 yuan to subscribe to government bonds, saying: "By purchasing government bonds, the country can quickly realize industrialization and help us develop agricultural production, so that we can live a happier life in the future."

Cadres of Northwest regional and provincial and municipal level organizations, after studying the general line, many have rearranged their income and expenditure plans in order to save more money to buy government bonds. All staff members of the Xi'an Branch of the People's Bank of China subscribed to more than 960 million yuan in government bonds in just six days, starting from January 4th. Staff members of more than sixty units, including the Northwest Federation of Trade Unions and the Xi'an Electric Power Bureau of the Northwest Electric Power Administration, began pre-purchasing government bonds one after another in mid-to-late December last year. The staff of the People's Government of the Gannan Tibetan Autonomous Region and its subordinate organizations pre-purchased more than 80 million yuan of government bonds in one day on December 18th last year. The faculty and staff of the Northwest Academy of Arts from fifteen ethnic groups, including Han, Uygur, Kazak, Tibetan, Mongolian, Hui, Tu, and Russian, subscribed to more than 50 million yuan in government bonds in just two days. Kang Baerhan (Uygur), director of the Department of Ethnic Minority Arts and a famous ethnic dancer at the school, subscribed to 3 million yuan in government bonds to support national construction. Teachers and students from many schools, such as the No. 264 Technical School, the Northwest School for Financial Cadres, the Northwest School of Trade, and the Tianshui Railway Middle School, have also actively subscribed to government bonds. Religious figures have also expressed their patriotism in subscribing to government bonds. For example, at a symposium held by the Xi'an Christian Association, the amount of government bonds subscribed on the spot reached more than 76 million yuan.
