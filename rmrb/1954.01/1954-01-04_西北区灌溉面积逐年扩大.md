Irrigated Area in Northwest China Expanding Year by Year

With the recovery and development of various economic construction projects in the motherland, the water conservancy construction and irrigation management work in Northwest China has continuously achieved new successes in the four years since liberation. On the vast Loess Plateau, many newly built and renovated canals of various sizes have been added, and the irrigated area has expanded year by year. Land that was once considered barren and infertile is now growing lush and strong crops year after year.

Before liberation, the Northwest region had a total irrigated area of more than 26.32 million mu. At that time, landlords and local tyrants in the countryside almost completely monopolized and manipulated water rights, and the vast number of farmers could not get enough water. At the same time, the canals were simple and disordered, and had not been repaired for a long time. The irrigated area shrunk year by year, and coupled with poor irrigation methods, the soil was severely damaged, greatly reducing the yield of grain and cotton.

After liberation, the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government first paid attention to the restoration and development of agriculture. In terms of water conservancy construction and irrigation management, in conjunction with the land reform work in rural areas, they completed the democratic reform of canal management and established people's water conservancy management institutions. New and old canals were renovated, and many water diversion and transmission projects, flood control and drainage equipment were added. The organizational leadership of many private canals was also strengthened, and full-time cadres were assigned. According to statistics, after liberation, 84 large canals, more than 90,000 small canals, and more than 168,000 wells were newly built and renovated in the entire region. More than 27,000 waterwheels were added. As of the end of October of the year before last, the irrigated area in the entire region had reached more than 34.79 million mu. If calculated based on the population of the entire region, each person already has more than one mu of irrigated land. In terms of irrigation management, through years of improvement efforts and learning from advanced Soviet experience, irrigation technology has been greatly improved. In Shaanxi, the water distribution work of each canal has been carried out in a timely and appropriate manner according to the crop and soil conditions; Gansu, Ningxia, Qinghai and other provinces have gradually achieved unified control of water volume and centralized allocation. Xinjiang has also initially implemented an irrigation system based on villages or small canals, advocating frequent shallow irrigation. Due to the improvement of irrigation methods, not only has the cultivated area been expanded, but also the drought has been overcome. Last summer, Gansu, Ningxia, and Qinghai suffered droughts of varying degrees. Wheat was short of water, and autumn fields could not be planted. At that time, the situation was very serious, and the responsible comrades of each province personally went to the irrigation areas to lead farmers to launch drought prevention and drought resistance campaigns. Ningxia Province convened a joint meeting of county party secretaries and county heads in the irrigation area. More than 80% of the cadres in each county, district, and township went deep to lead farmers to press waterwheels, dig canals, and use water economically, so that more than 500,000 mu of rice fields and more than 700,000 mu of autumn fields in the irrigation area were appropriately watered and sown in time. In the Hexi Heihe River downstream farmland of Gansu, under the personal leadership of the local party committee secretaries, after emergency water allocation measures were taken, the downstream farmland was generally watered with "life-saving water." Under the leadership of Chairman Zhang Zhongliang in Qinghai Province, the irrigated area of existing canals was also expanded, and the sowing task was completed. Through these measures, the vast number of farmers in the irrigation area overcame the drought. Wheat not only did not decrease in production, but instead achieved a bumper harvest. In the Huanghui Canal irrigation area of Gansu, the average wheat yield per mu was 463 jin, an increase of 163 jin compared to irrigation with waterwheels. In Zhangye County in the Heihe River basin, the average yield per mu was 360 jin, and in some areas it averaged 500 jin. In Ningxia Province, wheat yielded 260 jin to 350 jin per mu, more than double the yield of the year before last. Cotton production in the Jinghui Canal irrigation area in Shaanxi Province also increased by 140% compared to the year before last. In the irrigation areas of Xinjiang, the average wheat yield per mu last year was 267 jin. Rice in southern Shaanxi averaged 500 jin per mu, which was an unprecedented bumper harvest in many years.

Recently, the Water Conservancy Bureau of the Northwest Administrative Committee convened a conference on irrigation management to summarize past experience and put forward the tasks and directions for 1954. It is planned to expand the irrigated area by another 250,000 mu this year on the basis of irrigating the original farmland well, and further learn from advanced Soviet experience, advocate winter irrigation, and carry out irrigation experiments.

### 西北区灌溉面积逐年扩大

    西北区灌溉面积逐年扩大
    随着祖国各项经济建设的恢复和发展，西北区的水利建设和灌溉管理工作，解放后四年以来，已不断地获得了新的成绩。在广阔的黄土高原上，增添了许多新修和整修的大小渠道，灌溉面积逐年扩大。过去被认为贫瘠硗薄的土地，正年甚一年地生长着繁茂茁实的庄稼。
    解放前，西北地区共有灌溉面积二千六百三十二万多亩。当时，农村中的地主恶霸几乎全部霸占和操纵了水权，广大农民得不到充足的用水。同时，渠道也简陋紊乱，长期得不到修整，灌溉面积逐年缩减，再加上灌溉方法不良，使土壤遭到严重的破坏，大大地降低了粮食和棉花的产量。
    解放后，中国共产党和人民政府首先就注意到农业的恢复和发展，在水利建设和灌溉管理方面，结合着农村中的土地改革工作，完成了渠道管理的民主改革，建立了人民的水利管理机构。整修了新旧渠道，添建了许多引水输水工程和防洪排水等设备。对许多民营渠道，也加强了组织领导，配备了专职干部。据统计，解放后，全区新修和整修大渠道八十四条，小型渠道九万多条，水井十六万八千多眼。添置水车二万七千多辆。截至前年十月底止，全区灌溉面积已达三千四百七十九万多亩。如以全区人口计算，平均每人已有一亩多水地。在灌溉管理工作方面，经过连年的改进努力和学习苏联先进经验，灌溉技术已大大提高。陕西各渠道在配水工作上，已经按照作物土壤情况，作到适时适量；甘肃、宁夏、青海等省在用水上已逐渐做到统一掌握水量，集中调配使用。新疆也初步实行了以乡或以小渠为单位的灌溉制，提倡勤浇浅灌。由于灌溉方法的改进，不仅扩大了耕地面积，而且战胜了旱灾。去年夏天，甘肃、宁夏、青海均遭到轻重不同的旱灾，小麦缺水，秋田种不上。当时情况很严重，各省负责同志都亲到灌区领导农民展开防旱抗旱运动。宁夏省召开了灌区县委书记、县长联席会议，各县、区、乡百分之八十以上的干部，都深入领导农民压?、挖渠、经济用水，使灌区五十多万亩稻田和七十多万亩秋田，都适当地浇了水，及时播种。甘肃河西黑河下游农田，也在各地委书记亲自领导下，在作了紧急调配水量的措施后，使下游农田普遍浇上了“救命水”。青海省在张仲良主席领导下，也扩大了现有渠道的灌溉面积，完成了播种任务。经过这些措施，灌区广大农民战胜了灾荒，小麦不仅没有减产，反而得到了丰收。甘肃湟惠渠灌区，小麦每亩平均产量四百六十三斤，比用水车灌的增产一百六十三斤，黑河流域张掖县每亩平均产量三百六十斤，个别地区平均到五百斤。宁夏省小麦每亩二百六十斤到三百五十斤，高出前年一倍以上。陕西省泾惠渠灌溉区棉花产量也比前年增加了百分之一百四十。新疆各灌区小麦，去年平均每亩地产二百六十七斤，陕西南部水稻，每亩平均产五百斤，都是多年未有的丰产。
    最近，西北行政委员会水利局召开了灌溉管理工作会议，总结了过去经验，提出了一九五四年的任务和方向，计划在灌好原有农田的基础上，今年将再扩大灌溉面积二十五万亩，并进一步学习苏联先进经验，提倡冬灌和进行灌溉试验。
