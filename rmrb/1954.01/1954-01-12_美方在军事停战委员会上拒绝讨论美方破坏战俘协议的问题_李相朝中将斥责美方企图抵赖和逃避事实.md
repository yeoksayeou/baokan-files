Xinhua News Agency, Kaesong, January 11th: Yesterday at the Military Armistice Commission, the US side's chief commissioner, Lacey, attempted to use the "individual reports" of the Swedish and Swiss members of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission as a fig leaf to cover up the US side's sabotage of the explanatory work and unilateral termination of the explanation. At the Military Armistice Commission on the 10th, Lacey dared not deny the conclusive facts pointed out in the "Temporary Report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" that the US side directly directed terrorist organizations of special agents in the prisoner of war camps to obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war and sabotage the explanation work, but asked the Korean-Chinese side to pay attention to the "individual reports" and their conclusions of the Swedish and Swiss members, in order to shirk the responsibility of the US side.

Lacey's speech only further proved that the purpose of the Swedish and Swiss members in submitting "individual reports" was to whitewash the crimes of the US side. The Swedish member had already stated clearly: he refused to participate in the drafting and adoption of the "Temporary Report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" after December 18th in order to avoid blaming the US side for bearing the responsibility for "causing the failure of the explanation work."

In his speech, Li Xiangchao, Chief Commissioner of the Korean-Chinese side, accused Lacey of attempting to deny and evade the facts. He pointed out that the "Temporary Report of the Neutral Nations Repatriation Commission" clearly affirmed the facts that the US side instructed special agent organizations to sabotage the explanation work and obstruct the repatriation of prisoners of war. These conclusive facts cannot be concealed and denied by the US side, nor can they be changed by the minority reports of the Swedish and Swiss members. The US side must bear the serious responsibility for sabotaging the implementation of the explanation and prisoner of war agreement.

Yesterday, Lacey disregarded the clear provisions of Article 24 of the Armistice Agreement and refused to discuss the important issue of the serious sabotage of the implementation of the prisoner of war agreement at the Military Armistice Commission. Article 24 of the Armistice Agreement stipulates: "The general mission of the Military Armistice Commission shall be to supervise the implementation of this Armistice Agreement and to negotiate and resolve any incidents violating this Armistice Agreement." Lacey's attitude and the activities of the US side south of the southern edge of the Demilitarized Zone to plunder prisoners of war fully prove that the US side is prepared to forcibly detain more than 22,000 Korean and Chinese prisoners of war by force.

    美方在军事停战委员会上拒绝讨论美方破坏战俘协议的问题
    李相朝中将斥责美方企图抵赖和逃避事实
    【新华社开城十一日电】军事停战委员会美方首席委员拉西昨天企图把中立国遣返委员会瑞典和瑞士委员的“个别报告”作为掩盖美方破坏解释工作并片面终止解释的遮羞布。拉西在十日的军事停战委员会上，不敢否认“中立国遣返委员会临时报告”中所指出的美方直接指挥战俘营中的特务恐怖组织阻挠战俘遣返、破坏解释工作的确凿事实，却要求朝中方面注意瑞典和瑞士委员的“个别报告”及其结论，以此来推卸美方的责任。
    拉西的发言只是进一步证明瑞典和瑞士委员提出“个别报告”的目的，就是为了洗刷美方的罪行。瑞典委员早就明白地声明：他在十二月十八日以后拒绝参加“中立国遣返委员会临时报告”的草拟和通过，就是为了避免指责美方应担负“造成了解释工作的失败”的责任。
    朝中方面首席委员李相朝将军在发言中斥责拉西企图抵赖和逃避事实，他指出：“中立国遣返委员会临时报告”明确地肯定了美方指使特务组织破坏解释工作、阻挠战俘遣返的事实。这些确凿的事实决非美方所能掩饰和抵赖，也决非瑞典、瑞士委员的少数报告所能更改。美方必须担负破坏解释与战俘协议的实施的严重责任。
    拉西昨天并不顾停战协定第二十四款的明白规定，拒绝在军事停战委员会上讨论战俘协议的实施遭受严重破坏这一重要问题。停战协定第二十四款规定：“军事停战委员会的总任务为监督本停战协定的实施及协商处理任何违反本停战协定的事件。”拉西的态度与美方在非军事区南缘以南为劫夺战俘而作的活动，完全证明美方准备以武力强迫扣留二万二千多名朝中战俘。
