    Suggest that Yantai City Coal Briquette Production Units Use Loess Mud to Replace Asphalt in Manufacturing Coal Briquettes
    Reader Fan Di Gui writes: Asphalt is one of the important materials for basic construction projects. At present, China's asphalt production cannot meet the needs of construction. With the development of national economic construction, the demand for asphalt will gradually increase. However, according to my understanding, Yantai City is using asphalt to make coal briquettes. In 1953, a total of 22,000 tons of asphalt were used, and it is planned to use 30,000 tons in 1954.
    Although asphalt briquettes contain oil and are easy to burn, consumers have concerns because asphalt powder is harmful to the human body. Therefore, since Yantai began producing asphalt briquettes in 1951, they have never been able to completely open up sales in the market, and products are sometimes backlogged. However, loess mud briquettes produced in other cities are not only very strong in firepower and burning resistance, but also cheaper than asphalt briquettes (according to Shenyang prices, asphalt briquettes are 200,000 yuan per ton, and loess mud briquettes are 150,000 yuan per ton), and they do not harm human health. Therefore, I suggest that the coal briquette production department of Yantai City can use loess mud to replace asphalt in the manufacture of coal briquettes, so as to save a large amount of asphalt for use in places urgently needed for national construction.

### 建议烟台市煤球生产单位用黄土泥代替沥青制造煤球

    建议烟台市煤球生产单位用黄土泥代替沥青制造煤球
    读者范迪贵来信：沥青是基本建设工程的重要材料之一。目前我国沥青产量还不能满足建设的需要，随着国家经济建设的开展，沥青的需要量更将逐渐增加。但是，据我了解，烟台市却在用沥青制造煤球，一九五三年共用掉沥青二万二千吨，一九五四年还计划用三万吨。
    沥青煤球虽然含有油料，容易燃烧，但是因为沥青粉末对人体有害，消费者多有顾虑。所以烟台从一九五一年开始生产沥青煤球以来，始终未能在市场上彻底打开销路，产品时有积压；而其他城市生产的黄土泥煤球，不但火力和耐燃力都很强，而且价格较沥青煤球便宜（按沈阳市价，沥青煤球每吨二十万元，黄土泥煤球每吨十五万元），对人体健康又无损害。因此我建议烟台市煤球生产部门能用黄土泥代替沥青来制造煤球，以便省出大批沥青用到国家建设所急需的地方去。
