Henan Province suffered from frost, drought, pests, and hail in the spring of 1953, resulting in a poor wheat harvest. Although the early autumn crops were generally good last year, the late autumn crops were again hit by floods, droughts, pests, and hail. Most areas experienced reduced yields due to drought, and a few areas suffered severely from reduced yields due to flooding. Therefore, production for disaster relief has become one of the main tasks of Henan Province. The Party and government leading organs of Henan Province attach great importance to leading the disaster-stricken people to overcome famine through self-reliance in production. They have allocated more than 49 billion yuan in winter relief funds to help the masses in disaster areas overcome difficulties. The Henan Provincial People's Government issued instructions on winter production and disaster relief work in October last year and convened a production and disaster relief meeting, requiring all localities to conscientiously implement the policy of self-reliance through production, eradicate famine in winter, and create favorable conditions for agricultural production in 1954. In the past two months, the province's winter production and disaster relief work in disaster areas has achieved great results. The task of wheat sowing in disaster areas has been successfully completed, and mass sideline production has also been initially launched in many areas. In some areas, 50% to 80% of disaster-stricken households have participated in sideline production, and some villages and households have already achieved the goal of "eradicating famine in winter."

The experiences of Henan Province in production and disaster relief work are as follows:

First, leaders attach importance, divide responsibilities, start early, and strive for initiative. Qinyang, Yanjin, Junxian, Qixian, Huaxian, Changyuan, Shangcai and other counties, based on the instructions of the Henan Provincial People's Government on production and disaster relief work, combined drought resistance and wheat planting, and studied and arranged production and disaster relief work as early as possible. Leading cadres also clearly divided their responsibilities and transferred a large number of cadres to disaster areas to organize the disaster-stricken people to engage in self-reliance in production. For example, Qixian promptly established a joint production and disaster relief committee, headed by the deputy county head, residing in the disaster area to provide specific leadership; Shangcai County's Ninth District, based on the disaster situation, determined the division of labor for district cadres, who were stationed in villages for a long time, fixed areas, and contracted responsibility for each area; Yanjin, Wenxian, and Yuanyang counties have identified more than 140 full-time cadres for production and disaster relief work; some counties in Puyang Prefecture can also achieve "every village in the disaster area has someone to manage, and every household has someone to ask."

Second, conscientiously implement the policy of "self-reliance through production" and earnestly do a good job in sideline production. For example, Liaocheng Township in Qixian County has a total of 344 food-deficient households, and it is estimated that they will be short of more than 140,000 jin of grain when the wheat is harvested this year. However, after the autumn harvest and planting last year, they actively developed eleven kinds of sideline production, such as transportation, cotton ginning, and flour milling, because they clearly recognized the need to implement the policy of "self-reliance through production." In the past two months, the income from sideline production can purchase more than 170,000 jin of grain, which has completely eliminated famine in winter.

Third, strengthen economic work. State-owned trade departments and supply and marketing cooperatives take the initiative to go deep into disaster areas and disaster-stricken households to sign supply and marketing contracts and solve the specific difficulties of the disaster-stricken people. All areas where production and disaster relief work is done well have seized this important link.

Fourth, hold disaster-stricken people's representative meetings, implement the policy of production and disaster relief, mobilize the masses, build confidence, concentrate the wisdom of the masses, and exchange experiences in sideline production. Counties such as Junxian, Qixian, Shangcai, and Yanjin have held better disaster-stricken people's representative meetings. At the disaster-stricken people's representative meeting in Junxian County, not only did they find production avenues and formulate production plans by using the method of calculating large and detailed accounts, but also the trade company and the cooperative displayed the products that could be purchased, sold, and processed in kind, and immediately mobilized the disaster-stricken people to sign purchase and supply contracts according to their own production situation. Through this meeting, the disaster-stricken people quickly built up their confidence in overcoming the disaster and powerfully promoted the development of production and disaster relief work.

At present, although the production and disaster relief work in various parts of Henan Province has achieved great results, there are still many problems. The leading cadres in some areas are not familiar with the disaster situation, have no idea, lack proper arrangements for their work, and the production and disaster relief work is in a state of laissez-faire. Although some areas have already done some production and disaster relief work, there are still many disaster-stricken households (these households are precisely the masses who have a weak foundation, many difficulties, and are most vulnerable to disaster, and are also the focus of production and disaster relief work) who have not participated in production activities. In many areas, economic work cannot keep up with disaster relief work, the sideline production of disaster-stricken people is difficult, and there is a lack of necessary and timely relief for disaster-stricken people who must be relieved.

In order to further promote production and disaster relief work, the Henan Provincial People's Government convened a provincial emergency production and disaster relief work meeting from December 16 to 20 last year. During the meeting, Pan Fusheng, Secretary of the Henan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, gave instructions on the arrangement and leadership of the work in disaster areas, requiring all localities to re-adjust their forces and arrange production and disaster relief work, and resolutely implement the principle that production and disaster relief work is the overriding center in disaster areas, and all other work must be carried out in conjunction with doing a good job in production and disaster relief work. He asked all localities to establish a responsibility system for production and disaster relief work, and pointed out that in the future, any development of the disaster situation due to dereliction of duty by leaders will be strictly investigated.

This meeting further clarified the disaster situation, re-arranged production and disaster relief work, clarified that all light and heavily affected areas must take production and disaster relief work as the overriding central task, and determined that under the unified leadership of the Party and the government, the prefectures and counties in the disaster-stricken areas will be personally responsible by the commissioners and county heads, organize forces, and ensure that the production and disaster relief work is done well. The meeting further clarified that only by strengthening the leadership of economic work can the content of production and disaster relief work be enriched and the development of self-reliance through production be powerfully promoted. Therefore, it was determined that economic departments such as banks, state-owned trade, and cooperatives at all levels must take solving the difficulties of disaster-stricken people in production funds, supplying raw materials for sideline production, selling products, and organizing disaster-stricken people to engage in self-reliance in production as an important task of their departments. In the future, the deputy directors of banks and the deputy directors of cooperatives in each prefecture and each disaster-stricken county should be specifically responsible for production and disaster relief work in the disaster areas. The meeting also further resolved specific difficulties in grain supply, sideline production funds, raw materials, and product sales in disaster areas.

    河南省紧张进行冬季生产救灾工作
    贯彻生产自救方针争取把灾荒消灭在冬季
   【本报讯】河南省在一九五三年春季遭受霜、旱、虫、雹等灾害，小麦歉收。去年早秋作物虽然基本上丰收，但晚秋作物又遭水、旱、虫、雹等灾害。大部地区因旱灾减产，少数地区因水灾减产的情况很严重。因此，生产救灾工作就成为河南省的主要工作之一。河南省党政领导机关对领导灾民生产自救渡过灾荒的问题极为重视，已拨冬季救济款四百九十多亿元，帮助灾区群众解决困难。河南省人民政府在去年十月间发出冬季生产救灾工作的指示，并召开了生产救灾会议，要求各地认真贯彻生产自救的方针，把灾荒消灭在冬季，给一九五四年农业生产创造有利条件。最近两个月来，全省灾区冬季生产救灾工作已经取得了很大的成绩，灾区麦播任务已顺利完成，群众性的副业生产也在不少地区初步开展起来。有些地区已有百分之五十至百分之八十的灾户参加了副业生产，有的村、户已经实现了“把灾荒消灭在冬季”的要求。
    河南省生产救灾工作的经验如下：
    第一、领导重视，分工负责，及早动手，争取主动。沁阳、延津、浚县、杞县、滑县、长垣、上蔡等县，都根据河南省人民政府生产救灾工作指示，结合抗旱种麦，及早研究和安排了生产救灾工作。领导干部也明确分了工，并抽调了大批干部深入灾区组织灾民生产自救。如杞县及时成立了联合生产救灾委员会，由副县长任主任，住在灾区具体领导；上蔡县九区根据灾情，确定区干部分工负责，长期驻村，固定地区，分片包干负责；延津、温县、原阳三县，确定作生产救灾工作的专职干部有一百四十多人；濮阳专区有些县也能做到“灾区村村有人管，户户有人问”。
    第二、认真贯彻“生产自救”方针，切实做好副业生产。如杞县聊城乡共有三百四十四个缺粮户，预计今年麦收时将缺粮十四万多斤。但在去年秋收秋种之后，他们因为明确认识到必须贯彻“生产自救”方针，积极展开运输、弹花、磨粉等十一种副业生产，两个月来副业生产的收入可购粮十七万多斤，已完全把灾荒消灭在冬季。
    第三、加强经济工作，国营贸易部门和供销合作社主动地深入灾区、灾户，订立供销合同，解决灾民具体困难。凡是生产自救工作做得好的地区，都抓住了这个重要的环节。
    第四、开好灾民代表会，贯彻生产救灾的方针和政策，发动群众，树立信心，集中群众智慧，交流副业生产经验。灾民代表会开得较好的有浚县、杞县、上蔡、延津等县。浚县灾民代表会议上，不仅用算大账算细账的方法，找出了生产门路，订出了生产计划，并且由贸易公司和合作社把能收购、推销、加工的产品进行实物展览，当场发动灾民根据自己生产情况，订立了收购、供应合同。通过这次会议，灾民很快地树立了战胜灾荒的信心，有力地推动了生产救灾工作的开展。
    目前，河南省各地生产救灾工作虽已取得了很大成绩，但还有不少问题。有些地区的领导干部对灾情不摸底，心中无数，工作缺乏妥善安排，生产救灾工作陷于自流。有些地区虽然已经作了一些生产救灾工作，但还有许多灾户（这些户正是底子薄、困难多、最经不起灾荒袭击的群众，也正是生产救灾工作的重点）没有参加生产活动。不少地区的经济工作跟不上救灾工作，灾民的副业生产有困难，同时对必须救济的灾民缺乏必要而及时的救济。
    河南省人民政府为了进一步推动生产救灾工作，在去年十二月十六日到二十日又召开了全省紧急生产救灾工作会议。会议期间，中共河南省委书记潘复生就灾区工作安排和领导问题作了指示，要求各地重新调整力量，安排生产救灾工作，坚决贯彻在灾区以生产救灾工作为压倒一切的中心，其他一切工作都必须在做好生产救灾工作的基础上结合进行。他要求各地建立生产救灾工作的责任制，并指出今后凡是因领导失职而致灾情发展，一定严格追查责任。
    这次会议，进一步澄清了灾情，重新安排了生产救灾工作，明确了所有轻、重灾区都必须以生产救灾工作为压倒一切的中心任务，并确定了有灾地区的专区、县在党和政府的统一领导下，由专员、县长亲自负责，组织力量，保证把生产救灾工作做好。会议进一步明确了只有加强经济工作的领导，才能丰富生产救灾工作内容，有力地推动生产自救工作的开展。因此确定各级银行、国营贸易、合作社等经济部门，必须把解决灾民生产资金的困难、供应副业生产原料、推销产品、组织灾民生产自救作为本部门的重要工作，各专区及各受灾县银行副行长、合作社副主任今后应专门负责灾区的生产救灾工作。会议并进一步解决了灾区粮食供应、副业生产资金、原料和产品推销等方面的具体困难。
