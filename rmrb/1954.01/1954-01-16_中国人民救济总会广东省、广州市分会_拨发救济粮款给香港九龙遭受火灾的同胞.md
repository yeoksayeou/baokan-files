Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, January 15th. The Guangdong Branch and Guangzhou Branch of the Chinese People's Relief Association have allocated 700,000 catties of rice and 1 billion RMB yuan to aid compatriots affected by the major fire in the wooden house area of Sham Shui Po, Kowloon, Hong Kong on December 25th of last year. The funds, entrusted for distribution to the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and the Hong Kong and Kowloon Federation of Trade Unions, were distributed to the affected compatriots starting on the 14th.

This major fire was the ninth fire in the wooden house area last year, and the most intense and devastating. The circumstances are as strangely suspicious as the bizarre fire in Tung Tau Tsuen in November 1951. The fire initially broke out in Pak Tin Upper Village in the area at 9:30 pm on the day in question. While residents rushed to extinguish the fire, nearby villages also inexplicably caught fire. Although a large number of Hong Kong firefighting teams assembled at the scene, they adopted a frivolous attitude towards extinguishing the fire. Under the supervision of the masses, some firefighters stated, "We save people, not fire," "We only save stone buildings (referring to buildings outside the wooden house area), not wooden houses," and "We have not received orders." As a result, the fire burned for five and a half hours, and most of the seven wooden house areas of Pak Tin Upper Village, Pak Tin Central Village, Pak Tin Lower Village, Shek Kip Mei Village, Wo Tsai Upper Village, Wo Tsai Lower Village, and Kau Ka Tai Village were turned into ruins. According to the Hong Kong British Government Information Services, a total of 58,203 victims have been registered. Due to the Hong Kong British government's unreasonable restrictions on the registration of victims, despite victims possessing sufficient supporting documents, they were denied registration simply because they lost their "identity cards" when they were affected by the disaster. Therefore, the number of victims announced was greatly reduced. As far as is currently known, four of our compatriots were burned to death in the fire, more than fifty were injured, and all or most of the property of the victims was reduced to ashes. A large number of victims have fallen ill due to exposure and starvation. According to Hong Kong newspapers, more than 2,000 patients sought medical treatment from charitable organizations in the first week after the disaster, and there were multiple incidents of people fainting and dying in the streets due to excessive hunger.

The affected compatriots have now received relief grain and funds from the people of the motherland. This is the first time they have received grain and funds in their own hands in the 20 days since the disaster. They have expressed dissatisfaction with the attitude and many measures taken by the Hong Kong British government, which bears full responsibility for responding to the occurrence of this fire and handling the aftermath. After the disaster, the Hong Kong British government drove away residents of the stone houses in the area that were still habitable, sent bulldozers to flatten the disaster area, requisitioned private land, and at the same time carried out "screening" work on the victims, aimed at further reducing the number of victims. Besides providing rice and some old clothes to the victims, they did nothing else. The victims' urgent requests to build bamboo sheds to shield them from the wind and rain were not met. The victims expressed doubt about the British side's promises regarding the reconstruction of the disaster area to resettle the victims and the allocation of funds for relief.

### 中国人民救济总会广东省、广州市分会  拨发救济粮款给香港九龙遭受火灾的同胞

    中国人民救济总会广东省、广州市分会
    拨发救济粮款给香港九龙遭受火灾的同胞
    【新华社广州十五日电】中国人民救济总会广东省分会和广州市分会为救济去年十二月二十五日香港九龙深水埠木屋区大火灾的受灾同胞而拨发的大米七十万斤和人民币十亿元，已于十四日起由受委托发放的香港中华总商会和港九工会联合会分发给受灾同胞。
    这场大火是去年木屋区火灾的第九次，又是最猛烈最惨重的一次，情节和一九五一年十一月东头村离奇大火一样离奇。大火于当天晚上九时半首先发生在该区的白田上村，居民们纷赴抢救时，附近各村也无端地着了火。港方大批消防队伍虽齐集火场，但对扑灭火灾采取儿戏态度。在群众督责下，有些消防人员声言：“我们救人不救火”，“只救石屎楼（指木屋区外围的楼房）不救木屋”，“没有得到命令”。这样大火燃烧达五个半钟头，该区的白田上村、白田中村、白田下村、石硖尾村、窝仔上村、窝仔下村、九架梯村等七个木屋区的绝大部分变成废墟。据香港英国政府新闻处公布已登记的灾民共达五万八千二百零三人。由于香港英国政府对灾民登记给予不合理的限制，尽管灾民持有足以证明的资料，仅仅由于在受灾时失落了“身份证”，就被拒绝登记，因而公布的灾民数字是被大大地缩小了的。据目前所知，在火场中被烧死的我国同胞有四人，受伤的有五十多人，灾民的财产全部或大部已化为灰烬。灾民们因露宿和挨饿，大批地患病。据香港报纸载称：灾后第一周内，向慈善机关求诊的病人在二千以上，并发生因饥饿过度当街晕倒和死亡的事故多起。
    现在受灾同胞们领得了来自祖国人民的救济粮款，这是他们在受灾后二十天来第一次领到自己手中的粮款。他们对于应对这次火灾的发生和善后工作负完全责任的香港英国政府所采取的态度和许多措施表示不满。香港英国政府在灾后赶走了该区内仍可居住的石屋的居民，并派推土机铲平灾区，征用私有土地，同时进行旨在继续缩小灾民数目的“甄审”灾民的工作，对灾民们除了施饭和发过一些旧衣物外，就没有作过什么别的事，灾民们提出盖搭竹棚以蔽风雨的迫切要求，没有得到满足。灾民们对英方有关重建灾区来安置灾民的诺言和拨款救济一事表示怀疑。
