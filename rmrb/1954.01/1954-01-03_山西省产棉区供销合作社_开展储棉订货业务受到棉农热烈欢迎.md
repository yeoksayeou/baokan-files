Shanxi Province Cotton-Producing Area Supply and Marketing Cooperatives

Develop Cotton Storage and Ordering Business, Warmly Welcomed by Cotton Farmers

In order to protect the interests of cotton farmers, reduce currency issuance, and supply cotton farmers with needed materials in a planned way, the supply and marketing cooperatives in the cotton-producing areas of Shanxi Province have been carrying out cotton storage and ordering business since October of last year in their cotton purchasing work.

The cotton storage business organized by the cooperatives in the cotton-producing areas of Shanxi Province is based on the principle of cotton farmers' voluntariness. It organizes cotton farmers to store cotton in the cooperative. After the cotton storage period expires, payment is made according to the national cotton purchase price at that time. The price can only increase, not decrease, but no interest is calculated. The payment methods include one-time storage and one-time payment, and one-time storage and installment payments. Cooperatives in Jiang County, Xinjiang County, Quwo County, and other counties have signed "Cotton Storage and Ordering" contracts with farmers on the basis of cotton storage business. According to the contract, production materials and living materials needed by cotton farmers are supplied in a planned way.

Since the cotton storage business can avoid the difficulties of cotton farmers storing cotton and can ensure that cotton farmers receive reasonable prices, many cotton farmers are willing to store cotton in the cooperative. According to incomplete statistics from more than 30 counties in Yuncheng and Linfen prefectures, by the end of November, farmers had stored a total of more than 4.96 million catties of ginned cotton. Calculated at 7,330 yuan per catty, the state issued more than 36 billion yuan less in funds during this period, which played a certain role in stabilizing prices and accelerating capital turnover. The "Cotton Storage and Ordering" contract allows cooperatives to prepare materials for cotton farmers in a planned way, so that cotton farmers can buy satisfactory goods, so it is more popular with cotton farmers. From November 21st to 29th, the Diantou Primary Cooperative in Xinjiang County signed 81 "Cotton Storage and Ordering" contracts with more than 140 cotton farmers, and the farmers ordered more than 11.3 million yuan worth of production materials and living materials. In three days in November, the Gaoxian Primary Cooperative in Quwo County signed 13 contracts with cotton farmers. The cotton farmers stored 18,000 catties of ginned cotton and ordered 90,000 catties of cottonseed cake, 1,660 catties of fertilizer powder, five heads of livestock, seven large carts, and other small farm tools and daily necessities, worth more than 236.6 million yuan in total. After the primary cooperative bought back the Flying Pigeon brand bicycles for the cotton farmers in advance, the cotton farmers said with satisfaction: "The cooperative is getting better and better, and we can get everything we want. It really serves us." At present, many farmers are asking to supplement the contract and expand the amount of cotton storage and purchase of goods. (Zhang Buhua)

    山西省产棉区供销合作社
    开展储棉订货业务受到棉农热烈欢迎
    山西省产棉区供销合作社在购棉工作中，为了保障棉农利益，减少货币投放，和有计划地供应棉农需用物资，从去年十月份起开展了储棉订货业务。
    山西省产棉区合作社举办的储棉业务，是在棉农自愿的原则下，组织棉农把棉花存到合作社。储棉期满后，根据当时国家购棉牌价付款，价格听涨不听落，但不计利息。付款办法，有一次储存一次付款和一次储存分期付款两种。绛县、新绛、曲沃等县的合作社在储棉业务的基础上，和农民订立了“存棉订货”合同，按照合同，有计划地供应棉农需要的生产资料和生活资料。
    由于储棉业务可以避免棉农存棉的困难，并能保证棉农得到合理的价格，许多棉农都愿意将棉花存入合作社。据运城、临汾两专区三十几个县不完全的统计，到十一月底止，农民共储存了四百九十六万余斤皮棉。这些皮棉，每斤以七千三百三十元计算，就使国家在这期间少投放三百六十余亿元的资金，对稳定物价、加速资金周转等方面起了一定的作用。“存棉订货”合同，可以使合作社有计划地为棉农准备物资，使棉农能买到满意的货物，所以更受棉农欢迎。新绛县店头基层合作社，在十一月二十一日到二十九日，和一百四十余户棉农签订了八十一份“存棉订货”合同，农民订购了价值一千一百三十余万元的生产资料和生活资料。曲沃县高显基层合作社，在十一月份三天的时间内，和棉农签订了十三份合同，棉农存皮棉一万八千斤，订购了九万斤棉饼、一千六百六十斤肥田粉、五头牲口、七辆大车，和其他小农具、生活用品等，共值二亿三千六百余万元。该基层合作社提前给棉农买回飞鸽牌自行车后，棉农满意地说：“合作社越办越好啦，咱们想买的东西都能给置办来，真是为咱们服务的。”目前，许多农民正要求补订合同，扩大存棉、购货数量。　（张步华）
