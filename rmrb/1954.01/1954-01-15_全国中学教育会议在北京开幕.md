Xinhua News Agency, January 14th:

    The National Middle School Education Conference opened in Beijing on the 14th. The main purpose of this conference is to address the current tasks and working principles of middle school education; to resolve issues related to the development of middle schools and the participation of graduates from senior primary schools and junior middle schools in labor production; to strengthen ideological and political education in middle schools, improve teaching and student health; to strengthen the study of in-service teachers in middle schools; and to address the future development direction and tasks of secondary normal education. More than 230 people attended the meeting, including heads of education bureaus of major administrative regions, the Department of Culture and Education of the People's Government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, heads of education departments and bureaus of provinces and cities, and principals of some middle schools and teacher training schools.

    Wei Que, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, delivered the opening speech. He pointed out: In order to enable middle school education to correctly and steadily advance along the general line of the transition period, and to effectively meet the needs of socialist construction, this conference will study and formulate the guidelines and tasks of middle school education based on the general line and general tasks of the country's transition period, and study some important issues that urgently need to be resolved in middle school education based on the formulated guidelines and tasks. At the same time, we must also consider the needs of primary school education in the future according to the general line and general tasks of the country's transition period, and determine the direction and tasks of secondary normal education, so as to cultivate qualified primary education teachers in a planned way and gradually improve the quality of primary school education. He pointed out that in the first Five-Year Plan, the main tasks of education are two: first, to cultivate construction talents correspondingly for the needs of the country's socialist industrialization; second, to ensure the gradual improvement of the people's cultural level on the basis of developing production. On the one hand, middle schools must supply sufficient qualified reserve forces for universities and secondary vocational schools so that the state's plan for training senior and intermediate construction talents can be completed; on the other hand, they must steadily develop on the basis of production development and according to the availability of teachers and other conditions to appropriately meet the people's cultural requirements. Therefore, the development and improvement of middle school education is an indispensable link in socialist construction. Deputy Minister Wei Que also pointed out that the task of secondary normal schools is to train primary school teachers. The future development direction and tasks of secondary normal education should be to develop normal schools in a planned way and gradually shrink junior normal schools. In the future, junior normal schools should be responsible for rotating training of in-service primary school teachers. In the future, the supply of primary school teachers, in addition to normal schools, can also be provided by setting up accelerated teacher training classes as needed.

    Guo Moruo, Vice Premier of the Central People's Government Administration Council, addressed the meeting, saying that middle school education occupies an important position in our national construction. It improves the cultural level of the working people across the country. It provides the country's industrial and agricultural production enterprises with a labor force with a certain level of knowledge. It is cultivating a large number of reserve forces for our universities and secondary technical schools. The quality of middle school education can directly affect the country's production and cultural construction, and can more directly affect the quality of higher education and other educational work. Vice Premier Guo pointed out: We should start with ourselves, implement the spirit of the general line, and educate ourselves and our students with the advanced ideas of the working class in a concrete and in-depth manner. We must set an example in raising students' socialist consciousness, consolidating and systematically conducting cultural and scientific knowledge education, and always pay attention to strengthening physical and health education and exercise, improving students' health levels, and improving their aesthetic sentiments. Vice Premier Guo called on middle school educators across the country to strive to improve themselves, improve the quality of their work, and serve national construction well. He said that there will be some difficulties on our road forward, but these are difficulties in the course of victorious development. We should continue to develop the spirit of creation, the spirit of revolution, tap potential, take care of the overall situation, and learn from the advanced theories and experience of the Soviet Union in a more practical way on the basis of existing achievements, and strive to do a good job in the central link of education, middle school education, in training talents for the country.

    Wu Yuzhang, Chairman of the National Committee of the China Education Union, introduced the development of education in China since 1903 based on his own personal experience. He called on educators to arm themselves with Marxist-Leninist thought, while learning from the advanced educational experience of the Soviet Union, and to educate students to serve the people wholeheartedly in order to achieve the goal of building socialism.

    Lin Liru, Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Education of the Central People's Government, made a report at the meeting on "The Basic Situation of National Middle School Education and the Guiding Principles and Tasks for the Future." He pointed out that after four years of restoration and development, the number of students enrolled in middle schools across the country has increased by 186% compared with the number of students at the beginning of the national liberation, exceeding the highest figure in old China by more than one time. What is particularly important is that after four years of rectification and reform, some middle schools have been able to operate better in accordance with the requirements of people's education; most schools have made many achievements in the reform. Many outstanding model figures have emerged among middle school teachers and school leaders across the country, and they are the backbone for further improving middle school education in the future. The composition of middle school students and leaders has greatly changed. In the past four years, a large number of middle school leading cadres have been trained, promoted, and deployed across the country. The children of workers, peasants, and other working people, who were previously unable to receive middle school education, have now become the basic members of middle schools. According to statistics from the first half of 1953, the children of workers, peasants, and other working people have exceeded 70%, and in the Northeast and North China regions, they have reached more than 82%. Within the country, the reform of middle school teaching has also been preliminarily implemented, first of all the reform of teaching content and textbooks. We have also preliminarily carried out the ideological transformation of teachers and the study of political theory and educational theory, and have preliminarily rectified the teaching staff; we have also carried out revolutionary ideological and political education for students. Minority education has also developed greatly, with teaching conducted in the languages of the ethnic groups. In the past four years, reserve forces have been provided for the country to train construction talents. According to incomplete statistics, about 216,000 high school students and about 1,055,000 junior high school students have graduated across the country. Deputy Minister Lin pointed out that the above achievements are mainly due to the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and the People's Government, the efforts of middle school educators across the country, and especially the active and enthusiastic work of middle school teachers. However, there are still many shortcomings and problems in the work that must be overcome and resolved by all middle school educators. Deputy Minister Lin pointed out that the current task of middle school education is to educate students with the spirit of the general line and general tasks of the country's transition period, so that they can be prepared in terms of ideological politics and morality, culture and science, and physical health for further education or participation in labor production, and cultivate them into well-rounded new people who actively participate in socialist construction. According to the requirements of national construction and the tasks of middle schools, Deputy Minister Lin put forward issues regarding the future development direction of middle schools, middle school teachers and school buildings, the enrollment of senior primary and junior middle school graduates or participation in labor production, improving the quality of middle school education and improving the health of teachers and students, and improving the specific leadership of education administrative organs at all levels over middle schools, for the conference to discuss.

    全国中学教育会议在北京开幕
    【新华社十四日讯】全国中学教育会议十四日在北京开幕。这次会议主要是解决关于当前中学教育的任务和工作方针问题；解决中学的发展以及高小、初中毕业生参加劳动生产的问题；加强中学的思想政治教育，改进教学工作和学生健康状况问题；加强中学在职教师学习问题；关于中等师范教育今后的发展方针任务问题。参加会议的有各大行政区人民政府教育局，内蒙古自治区人民政府文教部，各省、市人民政府教育厅、局负责人以及部分中学和教师进修学校的校长等二百三十余人。
    中央人民政府教育部韦悫副部长在会上致开幕词。他指出：为了使中学教育能够正确地遵循着过渡时期的总路线稳步前进，能够有效地适应社会主义建设的需要，这次会议就要根据国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务来研究和拟订中学教育的方针、任务，并根据所拟订的方针、任务来研究中学教育当前亟待解决的一些重要问题。同时，还要根据国家过渡时期总路线和总任务来考虑今后小学教育的需要，确定中等师范教育的方针、任务，以便有计划地培养合乎标准的初等教育师资，逐步提高小学教育的质量。他指出：在第一个五年计划中，教育工作的主要任务有两个：第一，为了国家社会主义工业化的需要，相应地培养建设人材；第二，保证在发展生产的基础上，逐步提高人民的文化水平。中学一方面要供应高等学校和中等专业学校足够的合格的后备力量，使国家培养高级和中级建设人材的计划得以完成；另一方面要在生产发展的基础上和根据师资与其他可能条件稳步地发展，以适当地满足人民的文化要求。由此，发展和提高中学教育，是社会主义建设不可缺少的一环。韦悫副部长并指出：中等师范学校的任务是培养小学教师。中等师范教育今后发展的方针任务，应当是有计划地发展师范学校，逐步地收缩初级师范。今后初级师范学校应担负轮训在职小学教师的责任。今后小学师资的供应，除师范学校外，可按需要另办师范速成班。
    中央人民政府政务院郭沫若副总理到会讲话，他说：中学教育在我们国家建设中，是占有一定的重要地位。它为全国劳动人民提高文化水平。它为国家的工农业生产事业提供有一定知识水平的劳动大军。它为我们的高等学校和中等技术学校培养着大批的后备部队。中学教育的好坏，可以直接影响全国的生产建设和文化建设，更可以直接影响高等教育和其它教育工作的质量。郭副总理指出：我们应该从自己作起，贯彻总路线的精神，以工人阶级的先进思想具体深入地教育我们自己，教育我们的学生。我们要以身作则地提高学生们的社会主义觉悟，巩固地有系统地进行文化科学的知识教育，经常注意加强体育卫生的教育和锻炼，提高学生的健康水平，并提高他们的美育情操。郭副总理号召全国中学教育工作者努力提高自己，提高工作质量，好好为国家建设服务。他说，在我们前进的道路上是会有一些困难的，但这是在胜利发展中的困难，我们应该在已有的成绩的基础上，继续发挥创造精神，革命精神，发掘潜力，照顾全局，更切合实际地学习苏联的先进理论和经验，在为国家培养人材上，把中学教育，这一教育事业的中心环节努力办好。
    中国教育工会全国委员会主席吴玉章在讲话中以自己的亲身经历，介绍了中国从一九零三年以来的教育发展的情况。他号召教育工作者要以马克思列宁主义的思想武装自己，同时学习苏联的先进的教育经验，教育学生全心全意为人民服务，以达到建设社会主义的目的。
    中央人民政府教育部林砺儒副部长在会上作了“关于目前全国中学教育的基本情况与今后方针任务的报告”。他指出：中学教育经过四年来的恢复与发展，现在全国在校学生较全国解放初期的学生数增加了百分之一百八十六，超过了旧中国历史上最高数字的一倍。特别重要的是中学教育经过四年来的整顿和改革，已有一部分学校能按着人民教育的要求，办得较好；多数学校在改革当中取得了不少的成绩。全国中学教师和学校领导人员中，涌现了许多优秀的模范的人物，这是今后进一步办好中学教育的骨干。中学的学生成份和领导成份大大地有了改变。四年来全国各地培养、提拔和调配了大批的中学领导干部。工农劳动群众的子女，以前不可能受中学教育，现在已成了中学的基本成员。据一九五三年上半年的统计，工人、农民和其他劳动人民的子女已经超过了百分之七十以上，东北、华北两区已达到百分之八十二以上。在全国范围内还初步实行了中学教学改革，首先是教学内容、教科书的改革。我们还初步地进行了教师思想改造和政治理论、教育理论的学习，并初步整顿了教师队伍；对学生也进行了革命的思想政治教育。少数民族的教育也有很大的发展，用本民族的语言进行教学。四年来为国家培养建设人材提供了后备力量，根据不完全统计，全国高中约有二十一万六千多学生毕业，初中约有一百零五万五千多学生毕业。林副部长指出：以上这些成就主要是由于中国共产党和人民政府的领导，全国中学教育工作者的努力，特别是中学教师积极热情地工作才获得的。但工作中还存在着很多缺点和问题，必须全体中学教育工作者努力克服和解决。林副部长指出：当前中学教育的任务，是以国家过渡时期的总路线和总任务的精神教育学生，使他们在思想政治和道德、文化科学、身体健康等方面为升学或参加劳动生产作好准备，培养他们成为积极参加社会主义建设的全面发展的新人。根据国家建设的要求和中学的任务，林副部长在报告中提出了关于今后中学发展的方针、中学师资和校舍、高小、初中毕业生的升学或参加劳动生产、提高中学教育质量和改进师生的健康状况、改进各级教育行政机关对中学的具体领导等问题，提供大会讨论。
