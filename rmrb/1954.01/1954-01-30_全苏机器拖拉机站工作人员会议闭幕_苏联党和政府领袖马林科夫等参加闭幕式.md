Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, January 29th: The All-Union Conference of Machine and Tractor Station Workers, convened by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union, concluded on the 28th in the Kremlin after four days.

The leaders of the Soviet Communist Party and government, Malenkov, Khrushchev, Voroshilov, Bulganin, Kaganovich, Mikoyan, Suslov, Pospelov, and Shatalin, attended the closing ceremony of the conference.

For four days, the conference discussed the report by Soviet Minister of Agriculture Benediktov on "The Implementation of the Resolutions of the September 1953 Plenary Session of the CPSU Central Committee, and the Resolutions of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union and the CPSU Central Committee on Further Improving the Work of Machine and Tractor Stations." Leaders of machine and tractor stations, chairmen of collective farms, advanced tractor drivers, combine operators, agronomists, and agricultural administrators from various regions spoke at the meeting. They talked about the achievements of machine and tractor stations in helping collective farms develop production, described the situation of machine and tractor stations and collective farms implementing the resolutions of the CPSU Central Committee and the government on measures for the further development of agriculture, and the achievements and experiences in improving the use of tractors and developing overall mechanization of agricultural production. The chief agronomist of the Grodno Machine and Tractor Station, Shvitz, explained that the members of the "Progress" Collective Farm, served by this machine and tractor station, never harvested 100 poods of grain per hectare when they were individual farmers. In 1953, one work team of this collective farm harvested an average of 163 poods of spring wheat per hectare from 50 hectares of land. Deputy Minister of Agriculture of the Armenian Republic, Tsilingaryan, pointed out in his speech that the machine and tractor stations of the Armenian Republic are now fully equipped with various experts. With the help of machine and tractor stations, the sown area of vegetables and melon crops in the Armenian Republic will increase by 36 percent this year. The director of the Ashkov Machine and Tractor Station in the Moldavian Republic, Yalovenko, pointed out that field work in some collective farms served by this machine and tractor station is now 96 percent mechanized. The yield per unit area of sunflowers in the collective farms has reached the level planned for 1955. When discussing the issue of fully exploiting the potential of agricultural production, the Minister of Agriculture of the Russian Federation, Lobanov, and the Minister of Agriculture of the Kazakh Republic, Kalibuzhanov, pointed out at the meeting that continuous expansion of sown area, like increasing yield per unit area, is of great significance for further increasing agricultural production. From 1954 to 1955, the collective farms of the Russian Federation will reclaim 4.7 million hectares of wasteland, a number exceeding the total wheat sown area of Great Britain, Belgium, the Netherlands, Denmark, and Austria. Academician Lysenko, President of the All-Union Lenin Academy of Agricultural Sciences, also spoke at the meeting. He emphasized the tasks of agricultural scientific workers in further developing Soviet agriculture.

Before the closing of the conference, First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, Khrushchev, delivered a speech congratulating the delegates attending the conference.

Finally, the conference passed a letter to all workers, experts, and other staff of machine and tractor stations throughout the Soviet Union, calling on them to launch a socialist competition and strive to victoriously complete the various tasks of further developing agriculture put forward by the Party Central Committee and the government.

   【新华社二十九日讯】据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联共产党中央委员会和苏联部长会议召开的全苏机器拖拉机站工作人员会议，历时四日已于二十八日在克里姆林宫闭幕。
    苏联共产党和政府的领袖马林科夫、赫鲁晓夫、伏罗希洛夫、布尔加宁、卡冈诺维奇、米高扬、苏斯洛夫、波斯伯洛夫和夏塔林参加了会议的闭幕式。
    会议四日来讨论了苏联农业部部长别涅吉克托夫所作的“苏共中央一九五三年九月全会的决议，及苏联部长会议和苏共中央关于进一步改进机器拖拉机站工作的决议的执行情况”的报告。在会上发言的有各地机器拖拉机站的领导人、集体农庄主席、先进的拖拉机手、联合机手、农艺师和农业部门的行政人员。他们谈到了各地机器拖拉机站帮助集体农庄发展生产的成绩，叙述了机器拖拉机站和集体农庄执行苏共中央和政府关于进一步发展农业的措施的决议的情况，以及改进拖拉机的使用和发展农业生产全盘机械化的成绩和经验。格罗德诺机器拖拉机站的总农艺师什维兹说明这个机器拖拉机站所服务的“进步”集体农庄的庄员，当他们还是单干农民的时候，每公顷从来没有收到一百普特的谷物。一九五三年这个集体农庄的一个工作队从五十公顷的耕地上平均每公顷收一百六十三普特的春小麦。亚美尼亚共和国农业部副部长齐林加亮在发言中指出：现在亚美尼亚共和国各机器拖拉机站已全面地配备了各种专家。在机器拖拉机站的帮助下，今年亚美尼亚共和国的蔬菜和瓜类作物的播种面积将增加百分之三十六。摩尔达维亚共和国阿什科夫机器拖拉机站站长雅洛文科指出，这个机器拖拉机站现在所服务的一些集体农庄的田间工作，已有百分之九十六机械化了。各集体农庄的向日葵的单位面积产量，已达到了计划所规定的一九五五年的水平。在谈到充分发挥农业生产潜力的问题时，俄罗斯联邦农业部部长洛巴诺夫和哈萨克共和国农业部部长卡里布让诺夫在会上都指出：不断扩大播种面积也和提高单位面积产量一样，对进一步增加农业生产有着重要的意义。从一九五四到一九五五年，俄罗斯联邦各集体农庄将开垦四百七十万公顷的荒地，这个数目超过了英国、比利时、荷兰、丹麦、奥地利的小麦播种面积的总和。全苏列宁农业科学院院长李森科院士也在会上发言。他强调指出了农业科学工作者在进一步发展苏联农业中的任务。
