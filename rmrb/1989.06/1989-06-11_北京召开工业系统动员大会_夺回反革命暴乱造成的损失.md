Beijing Holds Industrial System Mobilization Conference to Recover Losses from Counterrevolutionary Riot

	Beijing held a mobilization conference for the industrial system today, attended by leaders from the industrial sector, central enterprises in Beijing, and managers of 100 key enterprises in the city. The conference called on all industrial workers and cadres in the city to urgently mobilize and recover the losses caused by the counterrevolutionary riot. Mayor Chen Xitong delivered an important speech at the meeting (see page 2 of today's newspaper).

	The turmoil and counterrevolutionary riot caused by a small number of people have had a significant impact on Beijing's industrial production. Despite the efforts of the majority of workers to overcome difficulties and continue production, the city's total industrial output value in May increased by 4.2% compared to the same period last year. However, it still fell short of the plan by 300 million yuan, with direct losses in profits and taxes amounting to over 80 million yuan. Since the beginning of June, except for a few key enterprises and workshops such as Shougang, Yanshan Petrochemical Company, Mining Bureau, Coking Plant, and Factory 751 that continued production, most enterprises have been in a state of shutdown or partial shutdown. Preliminary estimates indicate that in the first 7 days of June alone, the output value fell short of the plan by nearly 4 billion yuan, with losses in profits and taxes exceeding 1 billion yuan. Beijing's industrial output value for this year is planned to be 45.2 billion yuan, an 8% increase over last year. Excluding the 18.06 billion yuan already completed in the first five months, there is still a task of 27.14 billion yuan for the remaining seven months, averaging 3.88 billion yuan per month, making the task quite arduous.

	Vice Mayor Wu Yi said at the meeting that during the counterrevolutionary riot, the working class of the capital overcame numerous difficulties, maintained production, and ensured the production and supply of coal, electricity, gas, liquefied gas, and basic living necessities for the 11 million people in the capital. This made an important contribution to stabilizing public morale and the overall situation in the capital. As the vice mayor in charge of industry, she called on all industrial workers in the city to follow the strategic deployment of the Party Central Committee, to continue to suppress the counterrevolutionary riot, and to urgently mobilize to overcome all difficulties, quickly, and comprehensively restore production and work order.

　　北京召开工业系统动员大会
    夺回反革命暴乱造成的损失
    据新华社北京６月１０日电  （记者夏俊生）中共北京市委和市政府今天召开有工业系统领导干部、中央在京企业和全市１００户重点企业厂长参加的动员大会，号召全市工业系统干部、职工紧急动员起来，把反革命暴乱造成的损失夺回来。陈希同市长在会上发表了重要讲话（见６月１１日本报二版）。
    极少数人制造的动乱和反革命暴乱，使北京市的工业生产受到很大影响。尽管由于广大职工千方百计克服困难，努力生产，使全市５月份的工业总产值比去年同期增长４．２％，但仍比计划减少３亿元，直接损失利税达８０００多万元，进入６月以来，除首钢、燕山石化总公司、矿务局、焦化厂、７５１厂等部分重点企业重点车间继续坚持生产以外，大部分企业处于停产半停产状态。初步估算，仅６月份头７天就比计划减少产值近４亿元，损失利税上亿元。北京市今年计划完成工业总产值４５２亿元，比上年增长８％。除前５个月已完成１８０．６亿元外，后７个月还有２７１．４亿元的任务，平均每月要完成３８．８亿元，任务相当艰巨。
    北京市副市长吴仪在会上说，在反革命暴乱中，首都工人阶级克服了重重困难，坚持生产，保证了首都１１００万人的煤炭、电力、煤气、液化气以及基本生活用品的生产供应，为稳定人心、稳定首都大局作出了重要贡献。她作为主管工业的副市长，号召全市工业战线的全体职工，紧跟党中央的战略部署，在继续平息反革命暴乱的同时，紧急动员起来，克服一切困难，迅速、全面地恢复一切生产秩序和工作秩序。
