The Bank of Japan has decided to raise the discount rate by 0.75% starting today, increasing the annual interest rate from 2.5% to 3.25%. This is the first time in 9 years and 2 months that the Bank of Japan has raised the discount rate, implementing a tightening policy.

Since the beginning of this year, influenced by factors such as the improvement of the U.S. economic situation, rising oil prices, and domestic political turmoil in Japan, the yen exchange rate has significantly declined. The exchange rate between the U.S. dollar and the yen, which was around 1:125 at the beginning of the year, broke through 1:130 by the end of March and 1:140 by late May. Despite the Bank of Japan's efforts to sell dollars, increasing from $200 million to over $10 billion daily, it has not been able to stop the yen's downward trend. Domestic prices in Japan have shown signs of rising. Under these circumstances, the Bank of Japan has decided to raise the discount rate. The Bank of Japan's governor said yesterday in a press conference that raising the discount rate is a preventive measure aimed at ensuring price stability, preventing further depreciation of the yen, and reducing the risk of inflation.

　　日本银行提高贴现率
    本报东京５月３１日电  记者于青报道：日本中央银行日本银行决定从今天起提高贴现率０．７５％，年息由２．５％上升为３．２５％。这是日本银行９年零２个月以来第一次提高贴现率，实行紧缩政策。
    进入今年以来，受美国经济形势好转、石油价格上涨、日本国内政局动荡等因素的影响，日元汇率大幅下降。年初还在１∶１２５左右的美元和日元的比价，３月末突破１∶１３０，５月下旬突破１∶１４０。日本银行抛售美元，从每天２亿美元直到１０多亿美元，仍未遏止住日元下跌的颓势，日本国内物价出现上涨迹象。迫于形势，日本银行作出提高贴现率的决定。日本银行总裁昨天在会见记者时说，提高贴现率是预防性措施，旨在确保物价稳定，防止日元继续下跌，减少通货膨胀隐忧。
