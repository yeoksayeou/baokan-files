Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 21st

The approval rating of the recently established Ueno Cabinet in Japan is only 15%, according to a public opinion poll released by the Tokyo Shimbun today.

The poll, conducted by the Tokyo Shimbun on June 17th and 18th, revealed that many voters believe the Ueno Cabinet is a continuation of the Nakasone and Takeshita Cabinets and has not seriously investigated the Liberal Democratic Party's involvement in the Recruit scandal.

Another notable aspect of the poll is the negative sentiment among female voters towards the Ueno Cabinet. Shortly after taking office, Ueno was exposed for having a questionable personal life. Japanese women, in particular, have strongly reacted to this. The poll shows that among those who support the Ueno Cabinet, only one-third are women.

Local opinion suggests that the Ueno Cabinet's low approval rating will put the Liberal Democratic Party at a disadvantage in the upcoming House of Councillors election. The Japanese House of Councillors election is scheduled for July 23rd.

　　宇野内阁民意支持率极低
    新华社东京６月２１日电《东京新闻》今天公布的一项舆论调查结果表明，刚成立不久的日本宇野内阁的支持率仅为１５％。
    《东京新闻》１７和１８两日在东京进行的这项调查结果表明，众多的选民认为宇野内阁与中曾根内阁及竹下内阁一脉相承，没有认真追查自民党在利库路特贿赂案中的问题。
    这项调查的另一个特点是女性选民对宇野内阁有反感情绪。宇野刚上台执政不久，就被揭露在生活作风上有失检点。日本妇女对此反映尤其强烈。这次调查表明，在支持宇野内阁的选民中，妇女仅占１／３。
    此间舆论认为，宇野内阁支持率如此之低将使自民党在即将进行的参议院选举中处于不利地位。日本参议院选举将于７月２３日进行。
