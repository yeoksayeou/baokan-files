Editor's Note: This is a letter from two students of the Beijing Petroleum Management Institute to fellow university students. The following is an excerpt.

	Beijing and national university students:

	The counter-revolutionary riot that occurred in Beijing has clearly shown that in our country of 1.1 billion people, not everyone is patriotic. A small group of counter-revolutionaries, conspirators, and people of various kinds who hate the socialist system are still hidden and exist. Those who advocate bourgeois liberalization are not willing to admit defeat. Internationally, there are still many people who hold hostile attitudes towards us, and they are always dreaming of overthrowing socialist China. In the face of the increasingly strong people's democratic dictatorship, they know their own weakness and can only use treacherous means, using the banners of "patriotism" and "democracy and freedom" to take advantage of the masses and our young students' dissatisfaction with "official profiteering" and corruption, spreading rumors, inciting trouble, misleading people, and creating chaos to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, negate the socialist system, and achieve their counter-revolutionary goals. This has been long planned and is a continuation of the bourgeois liberalization of the previous stage. Over the past few days, many of our classmates have been thinking and reviewing the events of this "student movement," gradually recognizing this point, and gradually seeing through the evil intentions of the likes of Fang Lizhi.

	Currently, this small group of counter-revolutionaries, while engaging in looting, arson, and vandalism, are also creating various shocking rumors to incite discord, confuse people, and create greater chaos. We must be vigilant, discern right from wrong, and guard against being deceived. For this reason, we call on classmates who have not yet returned to school to recognize the situation and return to school as soon as possible to resume classes, supporting the government and the army in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot with actual actions.

	Dear classmates, the party and the government have fully affirmed our patriotic enthusiasm. Even after the counter-revolutionary riot occurred today, the party and the government still insist on distinguishing us, the vast number of students, from a small group of conspirators and rioters, showing love, education, and saving those classmates who are unaware of the truth and have been deceived. This shows that the party and the government highly value our opinions and care for and love us young students. If we are truly patriotic, we should not take extreme actions such as strikes, marches, hunger strikes, and petitions. The formation of a serious chaotic situation and the occurrence of counter-revolutionary riots have proven that the situation has completely turned against the good wishes of us, the vast number of patriotic students. We have indeed been used and have become victims of the chaos created by a small group of conspirators. We should draw profound lessons from this.

	We should not forget that our country is still in the primary stage of socialism and that political struggles still exist. For many years, the struggle to win over the younger generation has been secretly ongoing. The reduction of Marxist education, revolutionary tradition education, and patriotic education in schools has given a small group of conspirators an opportunity to exploit. The propaganda of "capitalism is good" has filled the classrooms, which cannot but cause some classmates' thoughts to develop abnormally, cannot but cause some classmates to follow others, and cannot avoid the tendency to be one-sided and extreme. Therefore, we should strengthen our study of Marxism, continuously improve our ideological level and ability to discern right from wrong, become reliable successors of the revolutionary cause, and let the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, the people, and our parents rest assured.

	Classmates, at present, we not only need to distinguish ourselves from counter-revolutionary rioters but also need to expose them and resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionary momentum of the "Beijing Autonomous Federation of Students" and the "Beijing Autonomous Federation of Workers"; completely quell the counter-revolutionary riot; turn our patriotic enthusiasm into a driving force for learning; respond to the party's call, return to school, and make up for the losses caused by the chaos in our studies; with excellent learning results and the complete suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot, celebrate the 40th birthday of our great motherland!

### 两位大学生致高校同学一封信

　　两位大学生致高校同学一封信
    编者按：这是北京石油管理干部学院两位大学生致高校同学们的一封信，现摘要刊登如下。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
　　北京高校、全国高校的同学们：
    北京发生的这场反革命暴乱，已清楚地表明，在我们十一亿人口的大国中，并不是所有的人都像我们那样爱国。一小撮反革命分子、阴谋分子和形形色色仇视社会主义制度的人，还隐藏着、存在着；那些鼓吹资产阶级自由化的人并不甘心失败；国际上对我们持敌对态度的人还大有人在，他们无时无刻不在梦想颠覆社会主义中国。在人民民主专政日益强大的今天，他们深知自己力量的薄弱，只能采用阴险的手段，打着“爱国”、“民主自由”的招牌，利用群众和我们青年学生对“官倒”和腐败现象不满的心理，制造、散布谣言，煽风点火，蛊惑人心，制造动乱，企图推翻共产党的领导，否定社会主义制度，以达到他们的反革命目的。这是蓄谋已久的，是前一阶段资产阶级自由化的继续。许多天来，我们不少同学在思考，回顾这场“学潮”的前前后后，逐步认识了这一点，逐步认清了方励之之流的险恶用心。
    目前，这一小撮反革命分子在打砸抢烧的同时，又在制造种种耸人听闻的谣言，企图挑拨离间、搅乱人心，制造更大的暴乱。我们应提高警惕，明辨是非，严防上当。为此，我们呼吁尚未返校的同学，认清形势，尽快返校复课，以实际行动支持政府和部队平息反革命暴乱。
    亲爱的同学们，我们的爱国热情，党和政府已经给予了充分的肯定，就是在反革命暴乱发生后的今天，党和政府仍坚持把我们广大学生同一小撮阴谋分子和暴徒区分开来，以爱护、教育挽救我们那些不明真相上当受骗的同学。这就表明，党和政府对我们学生的意见是高度重视的，对我们青年学生是极其关心爱护的。如果我们是真正的爱国，就不该采取罢课、游行、绝食、请愿等极端行动。严重动乱局面的形成、反革命暴乱的发生，证明了事态的发展已经彻底走向了我们广大爱国学生良好愿望的反面，我们确实被利用了，成了一小撮阴谋家制造动乱的牺牲品，我们应该从中吸取深刻的教训。
    我们不要忘记我国还处在社会主义初级阶段，不要忘记政治斗争仍然存在的客观现实，多年来，争夺青年一代的斗争还一直在隐蔽地进行着。学校中马克思主义教育、革命传统教育和爱国主义教育的减少，给一小撮阴谋家以可乘之机，“资本主义好”的宣传充斥了课堂，这就不能不使一些同学的思想畸型发展，就不能不使一些同学跟着人家跑，看问题就不可避免地犯片面性、极端性的毛病。因此，我们应加强马克思主义学习，不断提高我们的思想水平和辨别是非的能力，成为革命事业可靠的接班人，让老一辈无产阶级革命家放心，让人民放心，让我们的父辈放心。
    同学们，目前，我们不仅要同反革命暴乱分子划清界限，而且要把他们揭露出来，坚决把“高自联”“工自联”的反革命气焰打下去，彻底平息反革命暴乱；把爱国热情化作学习的动力，响应党的号召，返校复课，抢回动乱给我们在学习上造成的损失，以优异的学习成绩，以彻底平息反革命暴乱的胜利，向伟大祖国４０周年的生日献礼！
    你们的同学：北京石油管理干部学院两名大学生
