Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 27th.

Bulgarian State Council Chairman Zhivkov today met with the visiting commander of the Warsaw Pact armed forces, Lushchev.

The Bulgarian News Agency reported that Lushchev and Zhivkov discussed ways to improve the joint armed forces of the Warsaw Pact and reached "complete agreement." They believe that it is particularly necessary at present to further strengthen cooperation among the armed forces of the member countries of the Warsaw Pact.

Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, June 28th.

Hungarian Foreign Minister Gyula Horn stated that Hungary will not withdraw from the Warsaw Pact.

Horn made this statement at a joint press conference with the Austrian Foreign Minister in the western Hungarian city of Sopron on June 27th.

Horn said that the demand for Hungary to withdraw from the Warsaw Pact is "completely unrealistic," and no serious political organization or political force would make such a demand.

During Hungary's political pluralization process, there have been voices in society advocating for Hungary to adopt a policy of political neutrality in international relations, withdrawing from the Warsaw Pact and the Council for Mutual Economic Assistance. Horn's remarks were directed at these statements.

He said, "The Warsaw Pact was formed under specific historical conditions, and its dissolution also requires certain historical conditions. We all need to work towards this."

He emphasized, "As long as the Warsaw Pact exists, we will remain its member. This is key to the success of thorough reforms at home."

　　日夫科夫会见华约司令  匈外长说匈不退出华约
    新华社索非亚６月２７日电  保加利亚国务委员会主席日夫科夫今天会见了正在保加利亚访问的华约武装力量司令卢舍夫。
    保通社说，卢舍夫同日夫科夫就如何改善华约联合武装部队问题进行了讨论，并取得了“完全一致的意见”。他们认为，当前十分有必要进一步加强华沙条约成员国军队之间的合作。
    新华社布达佩斯６月２８日电　匈牙利外交部长霍恩·久洛表示，匈牙利不会退出华沙条约组织。
    霍恩是２７日与奥地利外交部长在匈牙利西部城市索普伦联合举行的记者招待会上作出这一表示的。
    霍恩说，关于匈牙利退出华约的要求“完全不现实”，任何自诩为严肃的政治组织和政治力量都不会提交这种要求。
    在匈牙利实现政治多元化的过程中，社会上有人主张匈牙利在国际关系上实行政治中立化，退出华约和经互会。霍恩的谈话是针对这种言论而说的。
    他说，“华约是在特定的历史条件下形成的，它的解散也需要一定的历史条件，我们大家都要为此努力。”
    他强调说，“只要华约还存在，我们就仍是它的成员，这是国内的彻底改革能否取得成功的关键”。
