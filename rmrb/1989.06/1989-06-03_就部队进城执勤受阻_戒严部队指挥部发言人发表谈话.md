Today, some of the martial law troops, in accordance with the martial law order issued by the State Council, were dispatched to their duty points. During their advance, they encountered obstruction from some students and civilians who were misled. The officers and soldiers of the troops showed great restraint.

The spokesperson for the martial law troops command said that when the troops entered some intersections in the city, a very small number of people spread rumors, incited others to set up roadblocks, and obstructed the troops' advance. Some people even smashed military vehicles and seized weapons. Others shouted inflammatory slogans, surrounded, insulted, and cursed the officers and soldiers. There were also a very small number of lawless elements who threw glass bottles and stones at the advancing troops, injuring many officers and soldiers. Their actions seriously obstructed the martial law troops' operations, disrupted the implementation of martial law, and caused serious consequences. Throughout the process, the officers and soldiers of the martial law troops showed great patience and restraint, avoided conflicts with the civilians, and with their actions refuted the rumors spread by a very small number of people that "the military is entering the city to suppress the people."

The spokesperson for the martial law troops command pointed out that the martial law troops entering the duty points to carry out their duties is to fulfill their sacred mission, as assigned by the martial law order, to stop the turmoil and maintain the capital's public order and social stability. It is hoped that the broad masses of citizens and students will not believe the rumors spread by a very small number of people, will not be used by a very small number of people with ulterior motives, and will actively assist the troops in carrying out their martial law duties. At the same time, they should be vigilant against those who use this as an excuse to spread rumors, deceive the public, and create disturbances.

    就部队进城执勤受阻
    戒严部队指挥部发言人发表谈话
    新华社北京6月3日电  中国人民解放军戒严部队指挥部发言人称，今天，部分戒严部队按照国务院发布的戒严领，奉命进驻执勤点，在开进途中，受到一些不明真相的学生和群众的拦阻，部队官兵表现了极大的克制态度。
    戒严部队指挥部发言人说，部队进到市区的一些交通路口时，极少数人制造谣言，煽动一些人设置路障，阻止部队前进。有的人还砸军车，抢夺武器；有的人呼喊煽动性的口号，对干部战士围攻、侮辱、谩骂；还有极少数不法分子往部队行进队伍中扔玻璃瓶和砖头石块，许多干部战士被打伤。他们的这种行为，严重阻碍了戒严部队的行动，干扰了戒严令的实施，造成了严重后果。在整个过程中，戒严部队的干部战士表现了极大的忍耐和克制，避免了与群众发生冲突，用事实戳穿了极少数人散布的“军队进城是镇压群众”的谣言。
    戒严部队指挥部发言人指出，戒严部队进入执勤点执勤，是为了履行戒严令赋予的制止动乱、维护首都治安和社会秩序的神圣职责。希望广大市民和学生不要轻信极少数人制造的谣言，不要被极少数别有用心的人所利用，要积极协助部队完成执行戒严的任务。同时，要警惕有人借题发挥，造谣惑众，制造事端。
