After nearly 100 days of negotiations, the various parties participating in the Hungarian Round Table Conference reached an agreement today to begin substantive political talks starting June 13.

The agreement signed by representatives of the various Hungarian parties stipulates that the Round Table Conference will be attended by representatives from three sides: the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party, various opposition organizations (including the Hungarian Democratic Forum, the Alliance of Young Democrats, and seven other opposition organizations), and various social organizations and movements (including trade unions and the Patriotic People's Front). All parties will have equal rights. The Round Table Conference will also reserve a fourth seat, but the fourth party can only participate as an observer, such as representatives from interest groups (chambers of commerce or national small handicraft cooperatives, etc.).

The upcoming substantive talks will cover two main topics: first, determining the principles and rules for the progress of democratic politics, and second, discussing the strategic tasks of overcoming economic and social crises.

At today's press conference, all three sides emphasized that they will participate in the discussions with a sense of responsibility for the country and the people, rather than seeking private interests for their parties. They believe that moving from crisis to prosperity, achieving a democratic transition, and resolving political conflicts can only be achieved in a peaceful and non-violent manner.

The initiation of the Round Table Conference was proposed by the Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party earlier this year and is seen as a good starting point for Hungarian political organizations to move towards reconciliation and resolve major national issues through consultation. However, observers generally believe that the upcoming talks will not be easy.

### 匈圆桌会议将举行实质性会谈

　　匈圆桌会议将举行实质性会谈
    新华社布达佩斯６月１０日电  （记者邹国昌）经过近百天的谈判，匈牙利参加圆桌会议的各方在今天达成协议，决定从６月１３日起开始举行实质性的政治会谈。
    由匈牙利各方代表签署的协议规定，圆桌会议将由匈牙利社会主义工人党、各反对派组织（匈牙利民主论坛、青年民主战士联盟等９个反对派组织）、各社会组织和运动（工会、爱国人民阵线等７个组织）三方的代表参加，各方享有平等的权利。圆桌会议还保留了第四方的席位，但第四方只能以观察员身份参加，如某些利益代表机构（商会或全国小手工业合作社等）的代表。
    即将举行的实质性会谈有两个议题，一是确定实现民主政治进度的原则和规则，二是讨论克服经济危机和社会危机的战略任务。
    在今天的记者招待会上，三方都强调，他们将本着为国家、为人民负责的精神参加讨论，而不谋求党派的私利。他们认为，由危机走向繁荣、实现民主过渡和解决政治冲突，只有在和平和无暴力的情况下能实现。
    举行圆桌会议是由匈牙利社会主义工人党在今年早些时候倡议的，被认为是匈牙利各政治组织走向和解和通过协商来解决国家重大问题的良好开端。但观察家们普遍认为，今后的会谈将不会是轻松的。
