	What Will Happen in the Future?
	Pei Haisheng

	The pursuit of immediate gains has become a widespread social malady.

	It has infiltrated the educational sphere, from rural areas to cities, where countless children in their teens have dropped out of school to become child laborers, child farmers, or child merchants. Many students in school view learning as a burden imposed by their parents, and truancy and dropping out have become common. They can't wait to throw away their school bags and start earning money.

	It has seeped into the economic domain, where factory managers push for high consumption and equipment wear, leading to high inputs of manpower, resources, and energy in pursuit of rapid growth. The benefits of circulation have led everyone to engage in commerce, resulting in a "commodity grand tour" with prices skyrocketing.

	It has crept into party and government agencies, where officials, upon taking office, rush to build their own capital and achieve quick results, neglecting in-depth investigations and studies, making hasty decisions, acting arbitrarily, and disregarding mass relations, democratic practices, and improving personnel quality.

	It has permeated the minds of our youth, manifesting in countless ways.

	Our nation bears the deep imprint of agricultural civilization, and the shallow, narrow-minded attitudes of small farmers drive many to seek blind progress and personal gain, disregarding the long term and future prospects. This often leads people astray, with a surface calm but deep bitterness, like a precipice, and as fragile as a thread.

	I had a classmate from elementary school whose parents were individual business owners. To earn more money, my classmate dropped out of junior high in the first year to go into business. Later, due to poor accounting, my classmate got into a fight with a customer over a small transaction and punched the person to death, ending up behind bars awaiting execution.

	If he had studied a few more years, improved his cultural and moral standards, perhaps this would not have happened.

	Educating the next generation is a long-term endeavor. In life, it is common to see leaders of various units and enterprises entertaining guests, frequently hosting banquets that cost hundreds of dollars, but when it comes to spending money on education, they always find excuses like "financial difficulties" and "inability to afford it." This short-sighted, immediate-gain mindset, prioritizing immediate interests over long-term benefits, is it not dangerous?

	If a nation, from officials to the common people, intentionally or unintentionally allows short-term behavior to dictate, busily dealing with immediate matters, what will happen in the future?

### 将来怎么办？

　　将来怎么办？
    裴海生
    急功近利的短期行为，已成为一种社会流行病。
    它流到教育领域，从农村到城市，大批十几岁的孩童辍学成了童工、童农、童商。在校学生许多人视学习为家长“挤压”，厌学、逃学成风。恨不得早点丢掉书包去挣钱。
    它流到经济领域，工厂承包人拚消耗、拚设备，人力、资源、能源的高投入，追求高速度；流通有利，个个经商，疲劳繁忙的“商品大旅游，价格滚雪球。”……
    它流到党政机关，在职干部一上任就急于为自己捞资本、苦政绩，不愿深入调查研究，草率举措，我行我素，顾不了联系群众、发扬民主和提高人员素质。
    它流到我们青年的思想里，更是花样百出，数不胜数。
    我们这个民族农业文明的烙印太深，小农特有的浅近、狭隘的心态，驱使不少人只顾寻求盲目冒进，寻求与己有利，而不顾长远，不顾后劲，常常引诱人们入歧途迷津，它表面上恬淡，深层却苦酸，险似悬崖，危如游丝。
    我有位小学时的同学，家长是个体商业户，他们为了多个人手赚钱，我的同学在初中一年级就辍学从商。后来由于账目不精，那同学在卖货时为一宗小生意与顾客发生纠纷斗殴，一拳把人家打死，落得个铁窗待毙。
    如果他多上几年学，提高文化素质，提高道德水平，可能不会如此。
    教育后代是百年大计。生活中常见不少单位、企业的头头迎来送往，动辄几桌，花上几百，可要他拿出一点钱办教育却总推托“经济拮据，无能为力”。这种急功近利心态，为眼前利益而忽略长远的行为，难道不危险吗？
    一个民族，倘若从官到民，都有意无意让短期化行为驱役，忙不迭地为眼前事周旋，那将来怎么得了？
