Libo County Civil Affairs Bureau in Guizhou Province has been severely disciplined for using various despicable methods to embezzle, accept, and extort bribes while distributing subsidized loans and disaster relief funds. This bureau has been collectively involved in dividing the spoils.

Libo is one of the most impoverished counties in Guizhou Province. To help the county achieve prosperity, the state allocated 1 million yuan for subsidized loans and disaster relief. However, from the bureau chief to ordinary staff, most individuals in the Libo County Civil Affairs Bureau have been involved in embezzlement, accepting, and extorting bribes, or have participated in privately dividing public funds and property. The illegal gains of each person ranged from thousands of yuan to hundreds of yuan.

The case of embezzlement, accepting, and extorting bribes by the Libo County Civil Affairs Bureau was exposed after being reported and revealed by the public. Local leaders and relevant higher-level departments attached great importance to this matter and initiated an investigation. Recently, reporters learned from relevant departments that the deputy bureau chief Chen Fangren and staff members Guo Qingjun and Zhu Limin, who accepted and extorted bribes, have violated criminal laws. They were sentenced by the Libo County People's Court to 2 years and 6 months, 2 years, and 1 year and 6 months in prison, respectively. Their illicit gains were confiscated and turned over to the national treasury. The former bureau chief and other involved individuals also received disciplinary and administrative penalties.

    本报贵阳６月１８日电  记者潘帝都报道：贵州省荔波县民政局在发放有偿无息扶贫、扶优和救灾等款项时，采用种种卑劣手段贪污、收贿、索贿，进行集体分赃，最近受到了严肃查处。
    荔波是闻名贵州省的贫困县之一。国家为了帮助该县早日脱贫致富，专门拨给该县１００万元的有偿无息扶贫、扶优款以及其他救灾款。该县民政局从局长到普通干部，大多都有贪污、收贿、索贿或参与私分公款公物的行为。各人非法所得款物，多者数千元，少者也有数百元。
    荔波县民政局贪污、收贿、索贿案，经群众检举揭发，终被公开揭露。该县领导和上级有关部门对此极为重视，并立案进行查处。日前，记者从有关部门获悉，该局副局长陈芳仁和干部郭庆军、朱荔明收贿索贿，已触犯刑律，被荔波县人民法院依法分别判处２年零６个月和２年、１年零６个月的徒刑，赃款一律予以没收上缴国库。原局长及其他涉及者，也分别受到党纪、政纪等处分。
