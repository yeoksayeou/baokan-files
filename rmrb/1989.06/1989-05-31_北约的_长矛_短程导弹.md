    NATO's "Lance" Short-Range Missile

    Short-range missiles refer to missiles with a range of less than 500 kilometers. According to reports, the short-range missiles currently deployed by NATO in Europe are the extended-range versions of the "Lance" MGM-52C.

    The "Lance" is the second-generation ground-to-ground tactical missile of the U.S. Army. As a tactical fire support weapon for divisions and corps, it targets command centers, troop assembly areas, logistics facilities, missile units, forward airfields, fixed air defense positions, and key transportation routes. It uses pre-packaged liquid propellant, simple inertial guidance, and mobile launcher launch methods, and can also be airlifted and transported by water. The conventional version has a range of 75 kilometers, and the nuclear version has a range of 115 kilometers.

    The extended-range version of the "Lance" was developed and tested between 1967 and 1970, began production in 1971, and entered service in 1972. It was also equipped with the U.S. Army stationed in West Germany and the armies of West Germany, Britain, Belgium, Italy, and the Netherlands. Currently, NATO has 88 "Lance" missile launchers deployed in Europe. According to the design requirements, the "Lance" missile must be retired by 1995 at the latest. Additionally, NATO has 1,100 artillery pieces in the European theater that can launch nuclear warheads.

    It is reported that the Warsaw Pact currently has 1,379 short-range missile launchers of various types deployed in Europe. Additionally, the Warsaw Pact has deployed 2,757 artillery pieces that can launch nuclear warheads.

    短程导弹指射程５００公里以下的导弹。据报道，目前北约部署在欧洲的短导是“长矛”ＭＧＭ—５２Ｃ的加大射程型。
    “长矛”是美国陆军第二代地对地战术导弹，作为师级和军团级战术火力支援武器，打击目标包括指挥所、军队集结地、后勤设施、导弹部队、前沿机场、固定的空防阵地和交通要道等。它采用预包装可贮液体推进剂、简易惯性制导和机动车载倾斜发射方式，也可空运和浮渡。它的常规型的射程为７５公里，核弹型射程为１１５公里。
    “长矛”加大射程型于１９６７至１９７０年研制、试验，１９７１年开始生产，１９７２年开始服役并于同年装备驻西德美军和西德、英国、比利时、意大利及荷兰陆军部队。现在北约部署在欧洲的“长矛”导弹发射架共有８８具。按设计要求，“长矛”导弹最晚须在１９９５年退役。此外，北约在欧洲战区还有１１００门可发射核弹头的火炮。
    据悉，华约目前在欧洲部署了各型短导发射架１３７９具。另外，华约还部署了可发射核弹头的火炮２７５７门。
