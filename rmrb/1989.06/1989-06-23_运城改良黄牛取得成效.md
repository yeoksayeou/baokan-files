Yuncheng has made significant progress in improving yellow cattle. According to Xinhua News Agency in Taiyuan on June 22 (reporter Yang Yuliang), Shanxi Province's Yuncheng City has vigorously promoted the improvement of draft yellow cattle into dual-purpose (draft and meat) yellow cattle, achieving remarkable results. According to the latest statistics, the city has improved over 5,000 heads of yellow cattle, increasing farmers' income by over 1 million yuan.

In the past, farmers in Yuncheng raised yellow cattle mainly for plowing and harrowing fields, with local draft breeds being the primary type. Livestock workers in the city have applied imported high-quality beef cattle breeds to crossbreed with local yellow cattle. These improved yellow cattle have an average weight increase of over 52 kilograms compared to local calves of the same age at six months. After one year, they can be used for both labor and slaughter.

　　运城改良黄牛取得成效
    据新华社太原６月２２日电（记者杨玉良）山西省运城市大力开展把役用型黄牛改良为役肉两用型黄牛的工作，取得显著成效。据最新统计，全市已改良黄牛５０００多头，可为农民增加收入１００多万元。
    过去，运城市农民饲养黄牛都是为了耕田耙地，黄牛的品种以当地役用型为主。这个市的畜牧工作人员应用引进国外优良肉牛种牛对当地黄牛进行配种改良。这种改良后的黄牛半岁的体重平均高出当地同龄犊牛５２公斤以上，１岁后即可使役和宰杀。
