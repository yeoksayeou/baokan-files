Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, May 30th.

The domestic situation in Argentina remained tense on May 30th. Many shops and schools have started to close, and conflicts between looters and police enforcing martial law have intensified.

According to reports, by the evening of the 30th, in the capital Buenos Aires and Argentina's third-largest city Rosario, at least 12 people had died, 61 were injured, and over 1,000 people were arrested in the clashes.

In recent days, supermarkets and food stores in the interior regions of Córdoba, Rosario, Mendoza, and parts of the capital Buenos Aires have been repeatedly looted. The situation in Rosario, the capital of Santa Fe Province, is particularly severe. In response, the Argentine government declared martial law nationwide on the 29th to maintain normal order.

In Buenos Aires, the Chamber of Commerce has advised local businesses to close from 6 PM onwards. Additionally, from 6 PM to 9 PM on the 30th, local police clashed with individuals attempting to loot supermarkets. Both sides used stones, tear gas, and rubber bullets.

Argentine Interior Minister Pugliese stated in a speech on the evening of the 30th that the looters were "a group of extreme leftists." The elected President Menem said that the looting incidents were the work of "some professional instigators." Elected legislator and leader of the Argentine Socialist Movement, Samora, believed that the looting of food stores was due to "the people going hungry."

The Argentine General Confederation of Labor issued an urgent appeal on the 30th, calling for the Alfonsín government to transfer power to the elected President Menem as soon as possible.

According to reports, Argentina is currently facing severe economic difficulties, with hyperinflation and rising prices. The inflation rate in April was 33.4%, and it may reach 70% in May.

　　阿根廷局势依然紧张
    冲突激烈　商店停业　学校停课
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯５月３０日电  阿根廷国内形势３０日依然紧张。不少商店和学校已开始停业和停课，哄抢商店者同负责戒严的警察之间的冲突更趋激烈。
    据报道，到３０日晚，在首都布宜诺斯艾利斯和阿根廷第３大城罗萨里奥，在冲突中至少有１２人死亡、６１人受伤和１０００多人被捕。
    最近几天，阿根廷内地的科尔多瓦、罗萨里奥、门多萨以及首都布宜诺斯艾利斯一些地区多次发生哄抢超级市场和食品商店的事件，其中以圣菲省省会罗萨里奥的情况最为严重。为此，阿根廷政府２９日宣布在全国实施戒严，以维持国家的正常秩序。
    在布宜诺斯艾利斯，商会已建议当地商人从晚上６点起关门停业。另外，３０日晚６时至９时，当地警察同准备抢劫超级市场的人发生冲突，双方使用了石块、催泪弹和橡皮子弹。
    阿根廷内政部长普格利塞３０日晚在讲话中指出，哄抢商店的人是“一伙极左分子”。阿当选总统梅内姆在讲话中说，哄抢市场事件是“一些职业煽动者”干的。当选议员、阿根廷社会主义运动领导人萨莫拉则认为，造成哄抢食品商店这种局面，是因为“人民在挨饿”。
    阿根廷总工会３０日发出紧急呼吁，要求阿方辛政府尽早把政权移交给当选总统梅内姆。
    据报道，阿根廷目前面临严重的经济困难，通货膨胀，物价上涨。４月份的通货膨胀率为３３．４％，５月份可能达７０％。
