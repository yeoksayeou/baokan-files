The State Council has approved the designation of investment areas for Taiwanese investors in Fujian Province, encouraging Taiwanese investors to engage in land development and factory investments. This was announced by the Fujian Provincial Government to the media yesterday.

The areas designated as investment zones for Taiwanese investors are: Xiamen Economic Special Zone and the Laolin and Haicang regions under the jurisdiction of Xiamen City; the undeveloped parts (1.8 square kilometers) within the Fuzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone.

It is understood that the Fujian Provincial Government will formulate a comprehensive development plan and industrial policies for the investment areas, encouraging Taiwanese investors to establish sole proprietorships, joint ventures, and cooperative enterprises that meet the industrial policy requirements. For the land use of Taiwanese investment projects, the land will be provided in the form of land equity or paid land use rights (leases). The Standing Committee of the Provincial People's Congress will, in accordance with relevant national laws, promulgate local regulations to create a favorable legal environment for Taiwanese investments.

In recent years, Taiwanese investors coming to Fujian have become increasingly active. By the end of May, Fujian had approved the establishment of over 400 Taiwanese-invested enterprises, with more than half of these enterprises already in production. Currently, relevant departments in Fujian are actively creating all necessary conditions to ensure the success of the investment areas for Taiwanese investors.

　　经国务院批准    
    福建划定台商投资区
    本报福州６月２１日电  记者张铭清报道：国务院批准福建沿海划定台商投资区，鼓励台湾投资者从事土地开发经营和投资办厂，这是福建省政府昨天向新闻界宣布的。
    被划为台商投资区的是：厦门经济特区及厦门市辖的老林、海沧地区；福州经济技术开发区内未开发部分（１．８平方公里）。
    据悉，福建省政府将制订台商投资区总体开发规划和产业政策，鼓励台商举办符合产业政策要求的独资、合资企业和合作经营企业。对台商投资项目用地，采取土地入股或土地使用权有偿出让（租赁）的形式提供。省人大常委会将根据国家有关法律，颁布地方性法规条例，为台商投资创造良好的法律环境。
    近年来，来闽投资的台商日趋活跃。到５月底，福建已批准建立台资企业４００多家，其中半数以上的企业已开始投产。目前，福建各有关方面正以积极态度，为办好台商投资区创造一切必要条件。
