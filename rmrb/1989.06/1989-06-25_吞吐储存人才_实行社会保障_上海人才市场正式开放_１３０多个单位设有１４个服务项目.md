The long-awaited Shanghai Talent Market officially opened today. The establishment of the Shanghai Talent Open Regulation Center and the opening ceremony of the talent market were held at Shanghai Education Institute. Over 130 units set up 14 service projects including talent exchange, consultation, and arbitration registration.

According to statistics from 1988, Shanghai has 760,000 professionals of various types. Opening the talent market and establishing a talent mobility mechanism that aligns with socialist planned commodity economy is crucial for fully utilizing talent advantages and promoting the deepening of various reforms in Shanghai. To open the talent market, the Shanghai Municipal Personnel Bureau, along with experts and professionals, has worked diligently for three years to propose a series of supporting measures. With the official opening of the talent market, various professional and technical personnel can flow under national regulation and market rules, gradually achieving a two-way selection between employers and employees. This will make the allocation of talent resources more rational, ensuring that everyone is used to their fullest potential.

The Shanghai Talent Market has two distinctive features compared to general talent mobility:

First, it has a storage function. After implementing the fixed-appointment system and contract system, as well as optimizing combinations, some unappointed personnel, in addition to being absorbed within the unit, can be managed by the talent market. Depending on different situations, they can be trained for improvement, engage in technical services, or be recommended for new jobs.

Second, it provides social security. The talent market has established a social security department. For those whose contracts are terminated or canceled and are temporarily unemployed, as well as those who have resigned or been laid off, an unemployment insurance system is established to ensure they receive unemployment benefits.

　　吞吐储存人才　实行社会保障    
    上海人才市场正式开放    
    １３０多个单位设有１４个服务项目
    本报上海６月２４日电  记者萧关根报道：瞩目已久的上海人才市场正式开放，上海人才开放调节中心成立暨人才市场开放大会今天在上海教育学院举行，１３０多个单位在这里开设了人才交流、咨询和仲裁登记等１４个服务项目。
    据１９８８年统计，上海有各类专业技术人员７６万，开放人才市场，建立与社会主义计划商品经济相适应的人才流动机制，充分发挥人才优势，已成为推动上海各项改革深入发展带有全局意义的重大问题。为开放人才市场，上海市人事局等组织专家和专业工作者经过三年的艰苦工作，提出了一系列配套措施。人才市场正式开放，各类专业技术人员能在国家调控下按市场规则流动，逐步实现用人单位和被用者之间的双向选择，从而使人才资源的配置趋向合理，做到人尽其才。
    上海人才市场与一般的人才流动相比，有两个特点：
    一是具有储存的功能。实行定编和聘任制及优化组合后，一些未被聘用的人员除本单位内部消化外，可以由人才市场管起来，并按不同情况分别处理，或进行培训提高，或开展技术服务，或推荐介绍新的工作。
    二是提供社会保障。人才市场设立了社会保障部。对实行聘用合同制终止或解除合同后一时找不到工作的人员，以及辞职、辞退后的专业人员，建立待业保险制度，使他们享受待业保险待遇。
