According to a report from the *New China Daily*, yesterday, it was learned from the Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) in Nanjing that the first batch of 50 million yuan for the summer grain and oil procurement in Nanjing has been secured and is in place. The remaining funds needed will be fully raised by the beginning of June and will be disbursed in stages.

Since last winter and this spring, the officials and farmers of the five counties and four suburban districts in the city, with the support of various parties, have overcome various natural disasters. The total production of 1.7 million mu of wheat is expected to reach 350 million kilograms, matching last year's output. The 800,000 mu of rapeseed is expected to yield a bumper harvest, with a total production of around 75 million kilograms, an increase of over 40% compared to last year. The situation is promising, but there are also challenges, mainly the shortage of funds for summer grain procurement. Mayor Dai Shunzhi, and Vice Mayors Chu Jizhao and Li Yingjun conducted investigations and assessments in the five counties and four suburban districts in late May, and established a leading group for the allocation of summer grain procurement funds.

　　南京筹集夏粮收购资金
    首批五千万元已落实
    本报讯  据《新华日报》报道：昨天，笔者从南京市农行获悉，南京市首批夏季粮油收购资金５０００万元已经落实到位，其余所需的资金将在６月上旬全部筹措完毕，分期拨出。
    去冬今春以来，该市五县四郊的干部农民在各方支援下，战胜了多种自然灾害，１７０万亩的三麦总产可达３．５亿公斤，与去年持平；８０万亩油菜可获大丰收，总产７５００万公斤左右，比去年增产４成以上。形势喜人，但也有困难，主要是夏粮收购资金紧缺。戴顺智市长、褚吉照、李英俊副市长分别深入五县四郊对资金作了调查摸底，于５月下旬，成立了夏粮收购资金调度领导小组。
