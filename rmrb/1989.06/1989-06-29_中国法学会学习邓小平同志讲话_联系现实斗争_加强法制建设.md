Recently, the Chinese Society of Law held a seminar in Beijing to study Deng Xiaoping's important speech. Participants discussed how to further improve our country's socialist legal system in light of current events.

Many experts and scholars emphasized that this counter-revolutionary riot was a serious blow to our country's legal system. From the start of the campus unrest, almost every step violated the constitution and laws. Therefore, it is essential to summarize the experiences and lessons from the perspective of legal system construction. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, our country has made significant achievements in socialist legal system construction, but it is still not perfect. First, in terms of guiding ideology, after the shift in the focus of work, there is a lack of clear understanding of how to uphold people's democratic dictatorship in the context of reform and opening up; there is insufficient recognition that class struggle will continue to exist in certain areas for a long time and may intensify under certain conditions. Second, in terms of legislation, a series of laws and regulations that are compatible with the constitution to ensure citizens' legal exercise of their political rights have not been timely enacted, resulting in a lack of guidelines in some areas. In terms of law enforcement, there are still many instances of not enforcing the law, not strictly enforcing the law, and not investigating violations of the law, and the authority of the law has not been established. In terms of observing the law, although legal education has been conducted for several years, citizens' legal awareness and rule-of-law consciousness are still very weak, and there is neither a firm belief in exercising one's legitimate rights by law nor a habit of strictly observing laws and regulations. In this turmoil and riot, tens of thousands of students and the masses took an attitude of "legal illiteracy" towards the constitution and laws, providing an opportunity for a small number of counter-revolutionary rioters.

When discussing the state of legal theory in recent years, everyone pointed out that since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, legal research in our country has been unprecedentedly active, clarifying many theoretical issues, and establishing many major theoretical principles. However, we must also admit that the legal theoretical front has also been influenced by the international and domestic climate, and to some extent, there have been manifestations of bourgeois liberalization.

Everyone believes that the task of summarizing experiences and lessons in the legal community is also arduous. At the same time, we must "stand on reality, face the world, and face the future" to make more contributions to the construction of socialist democracy and legal system with Chinese characteristics.

### 中国法学会学习邓小平同志讲话  联系现实斗争　加强法制建设

　　中国法学会学习邓小平同志讲话    
    联系现实斗争　加强法制建设
    本报北京６月２９日讯  最近，中国法学会在北京召开学习邓小平同志重要讲话座谈会。与会者结合实际，就进一步健全我国社会主义法制的问题进行了讨论。
    许多专家学者强调，这场反革命暴乱是对我国法制建设的一次严重破坏。从闹学潮开始，几乎每一步都直接违反宪法和法律。因此，从法制建设角度认真总结经验教训，是十分必要的。党的十一届三中全会以来，我国的社会主义法制建设取得了很大成就，但还不健全。首先，在指导思想上，对工作重点转移之后，在改革、开放形势下如何坚持人民民主专政，缺乏足够清醒的认识；对阶级斗争还将在一定范围内长期存在、在某种条件下还可能激化的认识不足。其次，在立法上，没有及时制定出与宪法相适应的一系列保障公民依法行使其政治权利的法律和法规，致使在某些方面无所遵循。在执法上，还存在大量有法不依、执法不严、违法不究的现象，还未建立起法律应有的权威。在守法上，虽然进行了几年普法教育，但公民的法律意识和法制观念依然十分薄弱，既没有牢固树立起依法行使其正当权利的观念，也没有养成严格遵纪守法的习惯。在这场动乱和暴乱中，成千上万的学生和群众对宪法和法律采取的态度，可以说都处于“法盲”的状态，给极少数反革命暴乱分子提供了可乘之机。
    在谈到近年来法学理论状况时，大家指出，党的十一届三中全会以来，我国法学研究工作空前活跃，澄清了许多理论是非，确立了许多重大理论原则。但是，我们也应该承认，法学理论战线也受到国际大气候和国内小气候的影响，在一定程度上也有资产阶级自由化的表现。
    大家认为，在总结经验教训方面，法学界的任务也是艰巨的。同时，还要“立足现实、面向世界、面向未来”，为建设具有中国特色的社会主义民主与法制做出更多的贡献。
