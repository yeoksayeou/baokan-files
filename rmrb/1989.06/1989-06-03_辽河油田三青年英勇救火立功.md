Three young men, Zhang Weilong, Liang Xizhu, and Luo Yanjun, who bravely extinguished a fierce fire in an oil tank, recently received commendations from the Liahe Oilfield.

On the night of April 24, a sudden thunderstorm struck, igniting the gas venting from the top of the No. 2 settling tank at the Shenyang Oil Extraction Plant of the oilfield. Flames immediately shot up over 8 meters high. The No. 2 settling tank contained 4,000 cubic meters of oil, and there were 10 other oil tanks nearby, storing an additional 2,300 cubic meters of oil. If an explosion occurred, the consequences would be dire. The on-duty technician, Zhang Weilong, immediately sounded the alarm and then grabbed two fire extinguishers, rushing up the 14-meter-high settling tank towards the flames. At the same time, workers Liang Xizhu and vocational school intern Luo Yanjun, who had heard the news, also grabbed fire extinguishers and rushed to the scene.

The fire raged on, and the three young men, despite the risk of the oil tank exploding and enduring the intense pain of the flames, bravely navigated through the fire. They cut off the connection between the No. 2 tank and the other oil tanks and rushed to the top of the tank to extinguish the fire source. With the full cooperation of the entire station, they finally subdued the fire and protected state assets.

    辽河油田三青年英勇救火立功
    新华社沈阳6月3日电　舍生忘死扑灭油罐烈火的青年张维龙、梁希柱、罗延军最近受到了辽河油田嘉奖。
    4月24日深夜，天降小雨，突然一声惊雷击燃了油田沈阳采油厂二号沉降罐上方排气孔排出的天燃气，火焰顿时窜起8米多高。二号沉降罐储油4000立方米，周围还有大小10个原油罐，存油2300立方米。一旦爆炸，后果不堪设想。当班的技术员张维龙立即报警，然后抱起两个灭火器，迎着烈火蹬上14米高的沉降罐。这时，闻讯赶来的工人梁希柱和技校实习生罗延军也抱起灭火器冲了上去。
    火越烧越旺，三位年轻人冒着油罐爆炸的危险，忍着烈焰烧烤的巨痛，顽强地在烈火中穿行，切断了二号罐与其它油罐的通路，并冲到罐顶扑灭火源。在全站人员的大力配合下，终于降伏了火龙，保住了国家财产。
