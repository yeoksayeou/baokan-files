The U.S. Federal Reserve Board released a report on June 21, stating that while the U.S. economy is continuing to grow, the growth rate in some regions is slowing down. This situation may help to ease the pressure of rising prices.

The report is based on information from 12 regional Federal Reserve Banks.

According to reports, the U.S. consumer price index rose by 6.7% in the first five months of this year, up from 4.4% for the whole of last year. However, many analysts believe that inflation may begin to stabilize and could decrease later this year.

The report suggests that under current circumstances, the Federal Reserve Board does not need to raise interest rates.

In recent days, the U.S. dollar exchange rate has fluctuated slightly, but trading in the Western foreign exchange market has been sluggish, reflecting an uncertain outlook.

On June 21, the dollar-yen exchange rate in the Tokyo foreign exchange market opened at 1:144.85 and closed at 1:144.95. On June 15, the dollar-yen exchange rate had risen to 1:151.30 at the close. Due to U.S. market intervention, the dollar exchange rate in the Western European foreign exchange market has fallen. In London, the dollar's closing exchange rate against the West German mark on June 21 fell from 1:1.9825 on June 20 to 1:1.9730.

    美认为无需提高利率
    美元汇价起伏不大
    新华社华盛顿6月21日电  美国联邦储备委员会21日公布的一份调查报告认为，美国的经济虽在继续增长，但在一些地区经济增长率正在下降，这种局面可能有助于缓和物价上涨的压力。
    这个调查是在12个地区的联邦储备银行的报告基础上作出的。
    据报道，今年头5个月，美国的消费物价上涨年率为6.7％，比去年全年4.4％的上涨率有所上升。但许多分析家认为，通货膨胀可能开始稳定，而在今年晚些时候会有所下降。
    报告认为，在目前情况下，联邦储备委员会无需提高利率。
    新华社北京6月22日电  近几天来，美元汇价起伏不大，但西方外汇市场交易清淡，仍呈现对前景捉摸不定的气氛。
    21日东京外汇市场开盘时，美元对日元的比价为1∶144.85，到收盘时升到1∶144.95。6月15日收盘时，美元对日元的比价曾升到1∶151.30。由于美国对市场干预，西欧外汇市场上美元汇价有所下降。在伦敦，21日美元对西德马克的收盘比价由20日的1∶1.9825降到1∶1.9730。
