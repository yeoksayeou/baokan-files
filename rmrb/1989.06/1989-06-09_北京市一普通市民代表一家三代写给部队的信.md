The command headquarters of the martial law troops reported on June 9th: At around 7 AM today, two soldiers from the Fifth Platoon of a certain unit of the martial law troops were on duty at the Fuxingmen Overpass. A middle-aged woman insisted on giving them a bag of items, which they refused to accept. Later, the woman left the bag and disappeared into the crowd. The soldiers opened the bag and found inside it five types of food items: malted milk powder, chocolate candies, peanuts, etc., worth about 60 yuan. There was also a letter in the bag, the full text of which is as follows:

Dear soldiers of the great People's Liberation Army:
Brave martial law troops:
Dear comrades:
Defenders of the people, pillars of the republic:

We, a family of three generations from Beijing (one of the thousands of ordinary families in Beijing and throughout China), express our respect to you on behalf of all of us. We express the respect of all Chinese people with a conscience. Our dear comrades:

You have worked hard, you have been wronged, your blood, sweat, and tears have all fallen onto our hearts. With your precious youth and lives, you have established everlasting merits for the people and the country!

On this traditional Chinese festival, the Dragon Boat Festival, I want to express my feelings and the sentiments of our entire family of three generations. Please accept this small gift. It contains the tears of gratitude from the elderly, the admiration of the children, and our feelings that we cannot properly express.

Dear comrades, you have been wronged. You are also someone's grandchildren, children, fathers, and brothers. You have blood, and you have personalities. But you have an extraordinary will and an iron discipline. You would rather let blood and tears flow within your hearts and hang on your faces, but you leave peace and smiles for the people. You would rather be attacked than hurt the feelings of the young students. In these past half months of day and night, wind and rain, your actions in exchanging your lives for understanding have shown a great spirit: a sublime spirit of self-sacrifice!

Dear comrades, all of this is in our eyes and engraved in the hearts of the people. You are the civilized and mighty troops without shame!

I only want to say that when you are attacked by a small number of enemies and those who are misled, the broad masses of the people are in pain. But because of our kindness and lack of preparation, we have not been able to stand up and join you. Forgive us! Now, we know how to deal with the enemies. We will definitely firmly support you and bravely fight in the struggle. Do not be afraid of the temporary arrogance of the bad people and some confused people. Out of Beijing's more than 10 million people, how many are causing trouble on the streets? Believe that the vast majority, the vast majority of people fully understand and support you, are in line with the government, and are against the turmoil.

Seeing you day and night fighting for the capital and the country, we, the broad masses of citizens, all want to fight for our country with you, to shed blood and sweat. But we are also afraid that, in the event of the criminals' actions, in order to protect us, you will be harmed even more. Therefore, dear comrades, when we go past you against our feelings or look at you from afar, we sometimes have to hold back our tears. Please rest assured! Your merits are already recorded in the history of the republic by the people.

"The soldiers are the most sacrificial" — I used to remember this as a textbook. Today, I remember this as a lifelong motto to emulate. You are not inferior to the heroes of the Ailao Mountains. In a certain sense, you have paid more. It is easy to endure hard work, but it is difficult to endure blame. When your souls are seriously damaged, you have paid more profound and thicker love. I love you! Our entire family of three generations loves you! We all hate those vicious counter-revolutionary conspirators and thugs.

Dear comrades, you may not be highly educated, but you have exchanged your youth for the opportunity for others to receive a higher education. You love your country more, you love your career more, you are the proud descendants of the Yellow Emperor! This supreme virtue makes us feel ashamed in front of you. We do not deny that there are also confused people who have received higher education in our family. Your simple behavior, open hearts, and unlimited loyalty to the Party have given them an education that we cannot provide. Thank you! My dear comrades with pure hearts like crystals!

We wish you peace and health! We wish that there will be no more tears on your faces. Believe that one day soon, we will greet victory with smiling faces!

We will never forget Comrade Zhang's words yesterday!

Finally, wishing you a happy holiday (although we know you have no time for holidays)!

Wishing you new achievements in fulfilling the duties assigned to you by the constitution!

Since we are family, let's not be formal, let's celebrate the holiday together!

We deeply love you!

With deep respect,
A family of three generations from Beijing

　　北京市一普通市民代表一家三代写给部队的信
    戒严部队指挥部新闻处６月９日消息：今天上午７时许，戒严部队某部五连两名战士在复兴门立交桥执勤时，一名中年妇女带着一提包东西硬要让这两个战士收下，他们不肯收，后来这个妇女把东西放下，转身走入人群中。他俩打开提包发现，里面有麦乳精、巧克力糖块、花生米等五种食品，价值约６０元。提包里还装着一封信，信的全文如下：伟大的解放军官兵们：英勇的戒严部队指战员们：亲爱的同志们：人民的保卫者，共和国的柱石：
    我仅以我们全家三代人的名义（我们是全北京市、全中国千百万个家庭中的一个普通家庭）向您们表达自己的敬意。表示有良知的中国人的敬意。我们的亲人们：
    您们辛苦了，您们受委屈了，您们的鲜血和汗水夹着您们的泪水，每一滴都洒在了我们的心上。您们用宝贵的青春年华，用金子般的生命，为人民为国家立下了永垂的丰功！
    在今天，中国的传统民俗节──端午节之际，我想表达自己的感情，表达我们全家三代人的心意。请收下这份小小的礼品。这里有老人的感激之泪，有孩子的景仰之心，也有我们的难以正确表达的感情。
    亲人们，你们受委屈了，你们也是人之孙、人之子、人之父、人之兄，你们一样有热血，有个性。但你们更有超人的意志，有钢铁般的纪律。你们宁愿让血和泪流在自己的心上、挂在自己的脸上，却把和平和微笑留给人民群众。你们宁可受到围攻，而不愿伤害青年学生的感情，这半个来月的日日夜夜、风风雨雨，你们在用生命来换取理解的所有的言行中表现了伟大的精神：崇高的献身精神！亲人们，这一切都留在我们眼中，刻在人民心中。你们是无愧的文明之师、威武之师！
    我仅想说明，当你们受到一小撮敌人及不明真相的人的围攻时，广大的人民群众是痛在心上的，但是由于我们的善良和无准备没能挺身出来和你们站在一起。原谅我们吧！现在，我们知道了对待敌人应该怎样去做。我们一定坚定的支持你们。在斗争中勇敢作战。你们不要看那些坏人和一些糊涂人的一时猖狂。全北京１０００多万人口，在街上闹事的才有多少？相信我们绝大多数，绝大多数的人是完全理解和支持你们的，是和政府一致的，是反对动乱的。
    看到你们在日夜为首都，为国家奋战，我们广大市民都想和你们一起为自己的国家流血、流汗。但我们又怕，万一在歹徒们作案时，为了保护我们更让你们受到伤害。所以，亲人们，当我们违背自己的情感从你们身边匆匆而过，或在远处深深相望时，我们有时是强忍泪水的。请你们放心！你们的功劳，人民早已给记在共和国的历史上了。
    “军人是最富牺牲精神的”这话，我过去是作为教科书来记住的。今天我却是把这句话作为一生仿效的座右铭来永远记在心上。你们不比老山上的勇士逊色，在一定意义上你们付出的更多，任劳易、任怨难，在你们心灵上受到严重损害时，你们却付出了更深更厚的爱。我爱你们！我们全家三代都爱你们！都恨那些穷凶极恶的反革命阴谋家，暴徒们。
    亲人们在文化水平上，你们也许不算高，但你们却用自己的青春去换取别人受高等教育的机会。你们更热爱自己的祖国，你们更热爱自己的事业，你们是无愧的炎黄子孙！这种至高无上的品格使我们在你们面前感到羞愧。不否认，我们家中也有受过高等教育的糊涂人。你们质朴的行为，坦荡的胸怀，对党的无限忠贞，都给了他们我们无法给的教育效果。谢谢你们！我的有着水晶一样纯洁心灵的亲人们！
    我们愿你们平安、健康！我们愿你们脸上不再有泪水，相信在不久的一天，我们将会用笑脸来迎接胜利！
    昨天张工同志的话，我们永远不会忘记！
    最后，祝亲人们节日愉快！（知道你们没有时间过节）
    祝你们在完成宪法赋予你们的职责中立新功！
    咱们军民一家，既然是家里人，就别见外，一起过节吧！
    深深的爱你们！
