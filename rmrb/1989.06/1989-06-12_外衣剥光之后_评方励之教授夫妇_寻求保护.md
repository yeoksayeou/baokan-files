The recent incident of Professor Fang Lizhi and his wife Li Shuxian seeking refuge in the U.S. Embassy has revealed much.

This couple of professors is famous not for their academic achievements (there are many scholars in our country whose professional levels surpass theirs), but for their political stunts and the artificial hype they receive. Their political stunts involve criticizing the Communist Party, socialism, and the motherland. The more fervently and bizarrely they criticize, the more they are appreciated by anti-communist and anti-China forces overseas, and the more they are supported by those within China who hate the socialist system and the leadership of the Communist Party.

Professor Fang has two disguises: "patriotism" and "democracy." He frequently appears at various "salons," "lectures," and "discussion forums," talking about human rights, democracy, and freedom, adopting the posture of an intellectual who cares about the country and its people. This deceives some naive and young students who have been influenced by some bourgeois liberalization thoughts, making them unable to see through his true intentions at first glance.

In reality, the disguise of "patriotism" was stripped off when Fang Lizhi declared that he wanted to be a "citizen of the world." Some overseas individuals also sneered at his brazen performance, advising him to reflect on himself for five years. Naturally, he is too busy cursing and organizing, planning, and directing to have time for reflection. Recently, he even advised foreigners to withdraw funds and put pressure on the Chinese government, playing the role of a "strategist." Now, he has rushed into the U.S. Embassy, further lowering his status to that of a beggar. If he offers any more advice, it would probably be to "use barbarians to control China."

Mr. Fang likes to talk about freedom. He has the freedom to oppose the Communist Party. The Communist Party also has the freedom to expel him. He has the freedom to willingly be a foreigner's lackey, and the Chinese people have the freedom to denounce him.

About half a year ago, overseas anti-communist publications did not hesitate to use a large amount of space to endorse Fang Lizhi as a "democratic fighter," saying he was the spiritual leader of the impending large-scale "democratic movement" (incidentally, they also listed the names of several close comrades of Mr. Fang in this leadership lineup). Whether it was through direct instruction or sensing the atmosphere within China and the Communist Party, Mr. Fang not only openly presented ideas such as "Marxism-Leninism is dead," "abandon the four cardinal principles," and "the way out for the mainland is capitalism" as a key to understanding the true meaning of some ambiguous texts in domestic newspapers, but also sent out action signals such as "intellectuals cannot rely solely on thought, they must take action," "the leadership headed by Deng Xiaoping has reached its limit," and "hope should be placed on the new generation of leaders."

After the turmoil began, it is said that he "bravely stayed put." What was he doing by "staying put"? After eating, he would say a few words like "extremely magnificent," encouraging students to starve themselves to death, so as to raise his own banner from the pile of corpses. Li Shuxian frequently appeared on Tiananmen Square, conspiring with the leaders of the illegal organization "Beida Autonomous Federation of Students" and directing students to "step by step push the situation to the whole country."

Now, the counter-revolutionary turmoil has exposed the true intentions of Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian's "democracy." The "democratic fighters" who are "not afraid of death" are left with only the "spiritual influence" of licking the crumbs from foreigners' tables. Their disguises have been completely stripped off. Those young friends who were once deceived and misled by them, all upright and patriotic intellectuals, and all kind-hearted and simple people, should take a look and think about it. What should we learn from their not-so-brilliant performance?

### 外衣剥光之后——评方励之教授夫妇“寻求保护”

　　外衣剥光之后
    ——评方励之教授夫妇“寻求保护”
    靳仁
    方励之、李淑娴夫妇近日跑到美国大使馆“寻求保护”。
    这个简单的事实，告诉人们不少道理。
    这对教授夫妇“名气”很大。这不是因为作为教授有了不起的成就（在我们的知识分子中，专业水平超过他们的比比皆是），而是靠出政治风头、被人为地捧起来的。这政治风头就是骂共产党、骂社会主义、骂祖国。骂得越起劲、越离奇，就越受到海外反共反华势力的赏识，越受到海内仇恨社会主义制度和共产党领导的人们的拥戴。
    方教授有两件外衣：“爱国”与“民主”。他以知识分子忧国忧民的姿态，频繁出没于种种“沙龙”、“讲座”、“座谈会”，讲人权，谈民主，说自由，使得天真幼稚又受一些资产阶级自由化思想影响的青年学生，还不能一眼识破他的嘴脸。
    其实，“爱国”这件外衣，到方励之宣称要作“世界公民”的时候，就已经剥光了。海外有人也对他的大言不惭的表演嗤之以鼻，奉劝他面壁五年。他自然天天忙着骂街和组织、策划、指挥，无暇面壁。前些日子，他又为外国人献计，要他们抽走资金，向中国政府施加压力，那角色有点像个“幕僚”。现在一溜烟钻进了美国使馆，身份再降，充其量算个乞丐。倘若再献什么计，恐怕只余下“以夷制华”了。
    方先生喜欢讲讲自由。他有反对共产党的自由。共产党也有把他清除出党的自由。他有甘心作洋人黄脸干儿的自由，中国人民也有声讨他的自由。
    半年多以前，海外反共报刊就不惜以大量版面，推举方励之为“民主斗士”，说他是即将爆发的大规模“民主运动”的精神领袖（顺便说说，他们在这领袖行列中，还写有方先生几位亲密战友的大名）。不知道是耳提面命呢，还是嗅到了海内和中国共产党党内的什么气候，方先生不仅透底拿出诸如“马列主义已经死亡”，“放弃四项基本原则”，“大陆的出路就是资本主义”之类思想的、政治的纲领，供献一柄理解国内报刊某些曲折文字本来含义的钥匙，而且发出诸如“知识分子不能单纯用思想，必须行动”“以邓小平为首的这一代领导人已走到了他们的极限”，“要把希望放在新一代领导人身上”的行动信号。
    动乱开始之后，据说他“不怕死地呆着”。“呆着”干什么呢？吃饱了饭，说几句“极为壮观”，鼓励学生绝食饿死，以便从死尸堆里摇出自己的将旗。李淑娴则频繁出现于天安门广场，与非法组织“高自联”头头共商大计，指挥学生“一步步把事情推向全国”。　
    现在好了，一场反革命暴乱已经揭破了方励之、李淑娴的“民主”的本意，“不怕死”的“民主斗士”只剩下舔洋人面包渣的“精神影响”。他们的外衣剥得精光。曾经一度被他们迷惑和欺骗的青年朋友，一切正直的、爱国的知识分子，一切善良的、单纯的人们，不妨看一看，想一想。我们从他们的并不高明的演出中，该悟出点什么东西呢？
