The Soviet leader Gorbachev's recent visit to West Germany is a significant event in East-West European relations. This is not only because it was Gorbachev's first visit to West Germany since he took office in the Kremlin four years ago, but also because it was the first time in eight years that a Soviet leader had visited Bonn. The visit took place at a time when the winds of reform and change are sweeping through the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and when European disarmament has already produced tangible results, attracting considerable attention from the international community. Two thousand journalists gathered in Bonn, with both East and West closely watching Gorbachev's every move, and West Germany experiencing a wave of "Soviet fever." All this indicates that Gorbachev's visit will have important implications for European peace and East-West rapprochement.

Post-war relations between West Germany and the Soviet Union have always been closely intertwined with U.S.-Soviet relations and East-West relations, serving as a microcosm of East-West relations during several post-war periods. In the 1950s and 1960s, during the Cold War, West Germany formally joined the Western alliance, followed by the Berlin Crisis, with the U.S. and the Soviet Union in a tense standoff in Europe, and relations between West Germany and the Soviet Union were extremely cold. Although relations between West Germany and the Soviet Union have eased somewhat in recent years, even reaching a high point, the overall relationship has been one of ups and downs, and the political mistrust between West Germany and the Soviet Union has not fundamentally changed, with West Germany deeply suspicious of the Soviet Union's strategic intentions.

This state of affairs, which has persisted for several decades, has undergone a tremendous change since Gorbachev came to power and proposed the "new thinking." Gorbachev reached an agreement with the United States to destroy intermediate-range missiles and took the first steps towards European disarmament, making serious proposals for disarmament in conventional weapons and other areas of greatest concern to Western Europe. Gorbachev attaches great importance to relations with Western Europe, repeatedly emphasizing the need to build a "European house from the Atlantic to the Urals" and stressing the unity of Europe, which to a considerable extent has dispelled Western European suspicions and improved the image of the Soviet Union.

On the other hand, Gorbachev has pushed forward reforms in the Soviet Union, especially in the field of political reform, making considerable progress. West Germany and Western Europe feel that the Soviet Union's domestic and foreign policies have indeed undergone important changes, and are not just playing with the words of peace and détente as in the 1970s. It can be said that the "new thinking" has laid the foundation for the improvement of West German-Soviet relations.

Sandwiched between the United States and the Soviet Union, West Germany has a unique situation and special interests different from those of other Western European countries, which make West Germany pay special attention to relations with the Soviet Union. Ensuring its own security, developing relations with East Germany, and developing economic relations with Eastern Europe are all dependent on establishing a stable and mutually trusting relationship with the Soviet Union. Despite some reservations from certain partners in the Western alliance, West Germany has repeatedly expressed its active support for Soviet reforms, emphasizing the need to seize the "historic" opportunity for disarmament, and placing high hopes on Gorbachev, all for this reason.

The focus of this visit is to lay the foundation for the long-term stable development of bilateral relations, and therefore the international political factors are prominent.

The joint statement issued by both sides is not only a manifestation of Gorbachev's "new thinking" but also a principled conception of the Soviet Union's European policy in recent years.

The following aspects have attracted the attention of West German public opinion:

First, the Soviet Union acknowledges that the security of one country cannot be built at the expense of the security of another, and commits to respecting the security interests of European countries. West Germany believes that this indicates that the Soviet Union has abandoned its policy of trying to split West Germany from NATO;

Second, it emphasizes efforts to overcome the division of Europe and stresses the unity of Europe. West Germany believes that this provides an opportunity for the ultimate reunification of the two Germanys. The statement agrees to include West Berlin in the scope of bilateral relations on the basis of the Four-Power Agreement, fulfilling a long-standing national demand of West Germany;

Third, it acknowledges the right of self-determination for all countries and the right to freely choose their social system. West Germany believes that this indicates that the Soviet Union will no longer tightly control Eastern Europe as it did during the Brezhnev era, providing a guarantee for Western Europe's approach to Eastern Europe.

For this reason, political forces of all parties in West Germany unanimously welcome the results of this visit, with many newspapers using terms like "historic document" to evaluate the joint statement. Chancellor Kohl believes that West German-Soviet relations have achieved a "turning point," and Gorbachev said that bilateral relations have opened a new chapter. From the direct effects, Gorbachev has, through this visit, won hearts for his "new thinking" and increased his bargaining chips for future negotiations with the United States; Gorbachev emphasized the "central significance" of relations with West Germany for Europe, raising West Germany's international status and increasing West Germany's weight in East-West relations.

Of course, many problems between East and West Europe cannot be solved overnight. Further negotiations are needed on issues such as conventional disarmament and the reduction of short-range missiles. It is also noted that Gorbachev avoided touching on a series of realities that have formed since the post-war era.

From this perspective, the construction of the "European house" will not be smooth sailing. However, it is important that the demand for cooperation between East and West Europe to transcend alliance relations has become an irreversible trend. The question now is how to turn words into action.

### 苏联的“新思维”与西德苏联关系——评戈尔巴乔夫访问西德

　　苏联的“新思维”与西德苏联关系
    ——评戈尔巴乔夫访问西德
    本报记者  江建国
    苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫最近对西德的访问，是东西欧关系的一件大事。这不仅仅因为它是戈尔巴乔夫入主克里姆林宫４年来的第一次访问西德，也不仅仅因为它是苏联最高领导人８年来首次来到波恩。这次访问成行于苏联国内大力推行改革、变革之风吹遍东欧、欧洲裁军已经取得实际成果之际，特别引起国际舆论界的注目。２０００名记者云集波恩，东西方注视着戈尔巴乔夫的一言一行，西德掀起一股“苏联热”。这一切表明，戈尔巴乔夫这次访问对于欧洲和平、对东西欧接近将带来重要影响。
    战后西德与苏联的关系始终紧紧地与美苏关系和东西方关系缠绕在一起，它本身就是战后几个时期东西方关系的一个缩影。５０年代和６０年代，东西方处于冷战状态，西德正式加入西方联盟，后来发生“柏林危机”，美苏在欧洲紧张对峙，德苏关系极其冷淡。尽管近几年来西德苏联关系有所缓解，甚至出现过高潮，但总的关系也近乎是时高时低，而西德和苏联政治上互不信任的局面没有根本改观，西德对苏联的战略意图疑惧很深。
    持续了几十年的这种状态在戈尔巴乔夫上台、提出“新思维”以后发生了巨大的变化。戈尔巴乔夫与美国达成了销毁中程导弹的协议，并第一次迈出了欧洲裁军的步伐，在西欧最为关注的常规军备和其他方面提出了认真的裁军建议。戈尔巴乔夫重视对西欧的关系，一再表示要建造一座“从大西洋到乌拉尔”的“欧洲大厦”，强调欧洲的一体性，这就在相当大的程度上消除了西欧的疑惧，改善了苏联的形象。
    另一方面，戈尔巴乔夫在苏联推进改革，特别是在政治改革方面迈出了相当可观的步伐。西德和西欧感到苏联内外政策确实发生了重要变化，而不是像７０年代那样玩弄和平与缓和词句。应该说，“新思维”为西德苏联关系的改善奠定了基础。
    夹在美苏之间的西德，有着同西欧其他国家不同的处境与特殊利益，促使西德特别重视与苏联的关系。确保自身安全、发展两德关系，同东欧发展经济关系，一样也不能绕开苏联，都有赖于同苏联建立稳定的相互信任关系。西德不顾西方联盟中某些伙伴的疑虑，一再积极表示支持苏联的改革，强调抓住“历史性”的裁军机会，对戈尔巴乔夫寄予厚望，根本原因就在于此。
    这次访问的重点是为双边关系奠定长期稳定发展的基础，因而突出国际政治因素。
    双方通过的联合声明既是戈尔巴乔夫“新思维”的体现，也是近年来苏联的欧洲政策的原则性构想。
    西德舆论注意的是以下几个方面：
    第一、苏联承认一国安全不能建立在牺牲他国安全的基础上，承诺尊重欧洲各国的安全利益。西德认为，这表明苏联放弃了把西德从北约分化出来的政策；
    第二、表示要努力克服欧洲的分裂，强调欧洲的整体性。西德认为，这就为两个德国的最终统一提供了机会。声明同意在４国协定基础上把西柏林纳入双边关系范畴，满足了西德一项长期的民族要求；
    第三、承认各国有自决权，有自由选择社会制度的权利。西德认为，这表明苏联将不再像勃列日涅夫时代一样严密控制东欧，为西欧同东欧的接近提供了保证。
    正因如此，西德各派的政治力量一致欢迎这次访问的结果，许多报刊都使用“历史性文件”这类词语评价联合声明。科尔总理认为，西德苏联关系已实现“转折”，戈尔巴乔夫说，双边关系已经掀开新的一章。从直接效果看，戈尔巴乔夫通过这次访问为他的“新思维”赢得了人心，增加了将来他同美国谈判的筹码；戈尔巴乔夫强调与西德的关系对欧洲有“中心意义”，提高了西德的国际地位，增加了西德在东西方关系中的份量。
    当然，东西欧之间诸多问题不可能一朝解决。在常规裁军、削减短导等问题上有待进一步谈判。人们也注意到，戈尔巴乔夫避免触及战后时代形成的一系列现实。
    由此观之，“欧洲大厦”的建造不会那么一帆风顺。但是，重要的是东西欧要求超越联盟关系的合作已经成为不可逆转的大趋势。现在的问题是，言论怎样变成行动。
