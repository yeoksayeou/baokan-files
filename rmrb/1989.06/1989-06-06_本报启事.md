	Recently, due to various reasons, the supply of paper needed for printing the newspaper has been difficult, and the printed newspapers have also been unable to be delivered, with no storage space available. Therefore, the newspaper has decided to start publishing four pages from today (Page 1: Domestic and International News, Page 2: Domestic News, Page 3: International News, Page 4: Miscellaneous). Once the situation returns to normal, the newspaper will resume publishing eight pages. This change is unavoidable, and we ask for the readers' understanding.

### 本报启事

1989-06-06
第1版(要闻)
专栏：

　　本报启事
　　近来由于各种原因，本报每天印报所需纸张供应有困难，印出的报纸也运送不出去，已无库房存放。为此，本报决定从今天起每天改出四个版（一版国内外要闻，二版国内新闻，三版国际新闻，四版综合）。情况正常后即恢复出八个版。这个改变，实属不得已，请读者谅解。
