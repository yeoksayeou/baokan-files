The United Nations, composed of 159 member states, is a barometer of international political trends. The trend of multipolarization in the contemporary world is also reflected in this barometer.

The manifestation of multipolarization within the United Nations has its own unique characteristics, primarily in the following aspects:

Firstly, the role of the United Nations, especially the collective role of the five permanent members of the Security Council, has been significantly enhanced.

With the development of the multipolarization trend, many global political, economic, and social issues can no longer be resolved by one or two superpowers alone. They must be addressed through the United Nations using multilateral approaches. The Soviet Union's acceptance of the United Nations' mediation in the Afghan issue and the United States' eagerness and initiative in the United Nations' mediation of the Iran-Iraq conflict in the previous year both indicate that while they each want to resolve these issues, they feel powerless to do so alone. Therefore, they have had to rely on the strength of the United Nations, especially the power of other major countries within the United Nations.

Starting with the mediation of the Iran-Iraq conflict, the five major powers gradually formed a new type of consultation mechanism. For major issues, they first conduct consultations among themselves to reach a consensus, then seek the opinions of non-permanent members of the Security Council and consider the wishes of the broader United Nations membership, and finally submit the issue to the Security Council for discussion and resolution. When implementing resolutions encounter problems and difficulties, the five major powers generally maintain a united stance, thereby greatly enhancing the position and authority of the Security Council, enabling it to function more effectively. Such a situation would have been impossible during the era when the United States dominated the United Nations or when the U.S. and the Soviet Union engaged in opposition within the United Nations, with one side always opposing the other.

Secondly, the tendency of the allies of the United States and the Soviet Union to act independently has further developed.

During the period of sharp confrontation between the United States and the Soviet Union, the two major blocs of the East and West basically maintained a unified voice, forming a standoff. However, at the 42nd and 43rd sessions of the United Nations General Assembly, this situation has changed significantly. The European Community has shown distinct positions from the United States on issues such as Central America and the Middle East, taking a more active stance in supporting the peaceful resolution of conflicts in these regions. In the previous year, when the Soviet Union proposed the establishment of a comprehensive security system, some Eastern European countries, although they voted in favor, did not express strong support. During the General Assembly last year, this tendency to act independently, based on the consideration of national interests, became even more apparent.

Thirdly, regional blocs formed on the basis of safeguarding regional interests have become more active. The Latin American bloc, the African bloc, and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations have each played a very important role in discussing issues such as Central America, Southern Africa, and Cambodia. In October of the previous year, before the Organization of American States held its meeting, Latin American countries were concerned that Reagan might propose unfavorable conditions for the peace agreement signed on August 7, so they requested an emergency session of the General Assembly to advance the discussion of the situation in Central America and passed a resolution supporting the agreement. During the General Assembly's discussion of the Middle East and Palestinian issues, Arab countries also strengthened their coordination and unity, with their steps becoming more consistent. Of course, when discussing economic issues, due to the uneven development of the regions and the different problems they face, the role of the Third World as a whole, as well as the combat effectiveness and influence of the Non-Aligned Movement, have both weakened and declined compared to the 1970s.

Looking ahead to the development of multipolarization within the United Nations, several aspects are worth noting:

Firstly, although the two superpowers have seen a reduction in their strength, they still possess considerable power. On one hand, they have to rely on the United Nations to resolve global and regional issues that they cannot handle alone. On the other hand, they always try to counterbalance the United Nations and free themselves from its constraints.

Secondly, after the formation of a unified market by Western European countries in 1992, they will undoubtedly strengthen their political coordination and unity, becoming a more powerful force within the United Nations.

Thirdly, after becoming an economic power, Japan is seeking the status of a political power and is expanding its influence in the Third World through increased economic aid. Therefore, its role and activities within the United Nations will also become more noticeable.

Finally, in the context of continued regionalization and bloc formation, how the Third World can act as a unified entity will be a new challenge facing the broad Third World countries.

　　从联合国看多极化趋势
    新华社记者  钱文荣
    由１５９个成员国组成的联合国是国际政治风云的一个大晴雨表。当今世界多极化的趋势，也毫无例外地会在这个晴雨表上显示出来。
    多极化反映到联合国内有其自身的特点，主要表现在以下几个方面：
    首先，联合国的作用，特别是安理会内五个常任理事国作为一个集体的作用显著加强。
    随着多极化趋势的发展，许多全球性的政治、经济和社会问题已非一两个超级大国所能解决，必须也只有通过联合国以多边方式寻求解决途径。苏联接受联合国对阿富汗问题的调解以及美国在前年联合国调解两伊冲突的过程中表现的迫切心情和主动性，均表明它们虽然各自都想摆脱和解决这些问题的困扰，却又感到力不从心，因此不得不借助联合国的力量，特别是联合国内其它大国的力量。
    从调解两伊冲突开始，五大国逐渐形成了一种新型的磋商机制，即对一些重大问题先在这五国内部进行磋商，酝酿出一致的意见，然后在充分征求非常任理事国的意见并考虑到广大联合国成员国的意愿的基础上，提交安理会讨论并形成决议；在实施决议遇到问题和困难时，五大国基本上能保持团结一致的立场，从而大大加强了安理会的地位和权威性，使其能更好地发挥作用。这种情况，在美国操纵联合国或美苏在联合国内采取“你赞成，我必反对”的对抗时代，是决不可能出现的。
    其次，美苏各自的盟国独立自主的倾向进一步发展。
    在美苏尖锐对抗的年代里，东西方两大集团基本上都各自保持用一个声音说话，形成两军对垒的局面。可是，在第４２、４３两届联合国大会上，这种情况已有了显著改变。欧洲共同体在诸如中美洲、中东等问题上表现出与美国明显不同的立场，对和平解决这些地区冲突问题采取了较为积极的支持态度。前年，苏联提出建立全面安全体系的提案，有些东欧国家虽然投了赞成票，但既不表态也不很热情。去年联大期间，这种以考虑各自国家利益为前提的独立自主的倾向愈加明显。
    第三，在维护本地区利益基础上形成的地区集团更趋活跃。拉美集团、非洲集团和亚洲的东南亚联盟在审议中美洲问题、南部非洲问题和柬埔寨问题上各自发挥着极为重要的作用。前年１０月间，在美洲国家组织开会前夕，拉美国家担心里根在会上对８月７日签署的中美洲和平协议提出不利条件，于是便要求联大召开紧急会议，提前审议中美洲局势，通过了支持该协议的决议。在联大讨论中东问题和巴勒斯坦问题时，阿拉伯国家内部也加强了协调，增强了团结，步调比较一致。当然，在讨论经济问题时，由于各地区发展不平衡，面临的问题不同，第三世界作为一个整体的作用，以及不结盟运动的战斗力和影响，与７０年代相比，也都有所削弱和下降。
    展望今后多极化在联合国内发展的趋势，有几个方面值得注意：
    首先，两个超级大国虽然力量有所削弱，但仍有很强的实力，它们一方面不得不借助联合国来解决它们无法解决的全球性和地区性问题，另一方面又总想抗衡联合国，摆脱联合国的制约。
    其次，１９９２年西欧国家形成一个统一的市场后，它们必将在政治上进一步加强协调和团结，在联合国内无疑将成为一支更强大的力量。
    第三，日本在成为经济大国之后正在谋求政治大国的地位，正在通过增加经济援助扩大在第三世界的影响，因而它在联合国内的作用和活动也将显得更加引人注目。
    最后，在区域化、集团化趋势继续发展的情况下，第三世界如何作为一个整体来发挥作用，将是摆在广大第三世界国家面前的一个新课题。
