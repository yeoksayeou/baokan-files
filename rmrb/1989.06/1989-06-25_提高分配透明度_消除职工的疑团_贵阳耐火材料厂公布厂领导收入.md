	Improving Allocation Transparency to Dispel Workers' Doubts
	Guiyang Refractory Materials Factory Publishes Income of Factory Leaders

	Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang. Reporter Pan Di Du reports: Guiyang Refractory Materials Factory recently announced the income of factory-level leaders and the first contractors of various workshops and departments for the months of January to April. This action dispelled workers' doubts about the allocation issue and further boosted workers' production enthusiasm.

	Starting this year, Guiyang Refractory Materials Factory implemented a contract responsibility system with appointment and risk compensation for the contractors of various workshops and departments, linking their contributions, risks, and economic benefits. At this time, some workers reflected that "cadres earn more," which affected the enthusiasm of a considerable number of workers, and some contractors also felt a heavier mental burden.

	This time, the factory union, based on accurate figures provided by the financial department, publicly announced the salaries and bonus incomes of factory-level cadres, chief engineers, chief economists, and the first contractors of various workshops and departments for the months of January to April. The rumors about certain individuals earning thousands of yuan per month were thus dispelled.

	Increasing the transparency of allocation has further boosted the production enthusiasm of both contractors and workers. Despite shortages in funds, electricity, raw materials, and other aspects, the entire factory has united to overcome difficulties. From January to May, the factory completed a production value of 6.83 million yuan and realized a profit of 2.29 million yuan, representing increases of 18.84% and 40.50% respectively compared to the same period last year.

　　提高分配透明度　消除职工的疑团    
    贵阳耐火材料厂公布厂领导收入
    本报贵阳电  记者潘帝都报道：贵阳耐火材料厂最近向全厂公布了厂级领导和各车间科室第一承包人１至４月的收入，从而消除了职工们对分配问题的疑团，进一步调动了职工的生产积极性。
    从今年开始，贵阳耐火材料厂对各车间科室的承包人实行了聘任制和风险抵押，使承包人的贡献、承担的风险和经济实惠挂钩。这时，有些职工就反映“干部得多了”等，因此使相当部分职工的积极性受到影响，有的承包人也感到思想负担较重。
    这次厂工会按财务部门提供的准确数字，将厂级干部和总工程师、总经济师以及各车间科室第一承包人１至４月的工资、奖金收入向全厂张榜公布，原来盛传的某人每月收入数千等疑团随之消除了。
    分配增加透明度，承包人和职工们的生产积极性都进一步调动了起来。全厂在资金、电力、原材料等方面紧缺的情况下，上下齐心协力，共克困难，１至５月共完成产值６８３万元，实现利润２２９万元，比去年同期分别增长１８．８４％和４０．５０％。
