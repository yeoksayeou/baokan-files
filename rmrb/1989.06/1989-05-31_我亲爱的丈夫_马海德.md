Last October, my dear husband Ma Haide suddenly left us. After 48 years of married life, my husband and I were suddenly separated. This is so hard to bear! Eight months have passed, but his image and laughter are always with me. His dedication to the cause of the Chinese people will forever inspire me.

In 1940, in Yan'an, we broke through various traditional constraints and finally came together. The 48 years of shared life brought me so much joy, so much happiness, so much encouragement, and so much strength!

	(1)

	Ma (this is how I always called him in life) was born in Buffalo, New York, in a family of steel workers. His ancestral home was in Lebanon. His father, due to the hardships of life, left home at the age of 14 to work as a child laborer in the United States and later became a steelworker. Those days, life was tough for a steelworker! Ma's family background had a profound impact on him, fostering his consciousness of the struggle for liberation of the oppressed. At the age of 23, to support the cause of the Chinese people, he overcame countless difficulties, crossed the ocean, and came to China. Later, influenced by Marxism, he decided to devote himself to the Chinese revolution. Through the introduction of Madame Song Qingling, he finally joined the ranks of the Chinese Workers' and Peasants' Red Army in 1936. Over half a century, he has shared the joys and sorrows with the Chinese people, experiencing countless storms!

In Shaanxi, his footsteps covered every corner, treating 40,000 people in the military and civilians. He once wrote a detailed report to Chairman Mao on the medical situation in Shaanxi. He not only affirmed the achievements but also pointed out the problems and proposed solutions. Chairman Mao highly appreciated his pragmatic report and subsequently appointed him as a consultant to the Military Commission's Health Department. However, no matter where he went, he always regarded himself as an ordinary soldier, rejecting special treatment, and had no airs of authority.

Due to his loyalty to the Chinese revolutionary cause, he was admitted to the Chinese Communist Party in February 1937, thus beginning a new chapter in his life. After moving to the city, he was appointed as a consultant to the Health Department. In addition to his medical work, he often used his international influence to promote the achievements of New China to the world, winning us many friends.

Whether in times of success or difficulty, he always had full confidence in the cause of the Chinese people. During the "Cultural Revolution," he was severely impacted. He was misunderstood and suffered many injustices. At that time, some overseas Chinese and foreign friends could not bear the pressure and left China with tears. I once quietly asked him, "The situation is so chaotic now, have you ever wavered?" He asked what I meant. I said about his belief in the Party. He calmly said, "Never, and I will never waver." He firmly believed that the Party was great, that a political party could recognize its mistakes and correct them, and that was the essence of greatness. He said, "The 'Cultural Revolution' was wrong, you'll see, it will be corrected in the future." When some foreign friends were "protected," a friend came to advise him, "Why not leave with your wife and children?" He angrily said, "Why leave? I love this land, I love the people here." The friend said, "You love China, but China doesn't love you!" He became even more angry. He glared with wide eyes and asked, "Who said that? Nonsense, that's just a small group of bad people causing trouble, they are the real enemies of the Chinese people, and their plots will definitely fail." One evening, he called me into the room and solemnly said, "If they also take me away for 'protection,' don't be sad. I have done nothing wrong against the Party or the people. My heart is clear, you should be at ease, I will be released sooner or later." Ma's character was very optimistic, cheerful, and humorous. During the height of the "Cultural Revolution," people were being denounced as traitors, with names written backwards and marked with an X. One day, he returned home and called out to me, "Su Fei, I've learned something new! I can recognize Chinese characters written backwards and marked with an X." Seeing my face darken, he immediately stopped smiling, "Yes! The Party leads the Chinese revolution to victory! Where do all these traitors come from?" This is a question worth pondering. When the Gang of Four fell, he quickly went to tell Louis Aylor and Dr. Miller. The three of them discussed until late at night. When he returned home, he was still thinking deeply about the significance of this event, and he couldn't sleep for three days and three nights.

	(2)

	He was a person who valued his work more than his own life. He often said, "I must seize every minute now! I must make full use of my limited life." So, in recent years, he has been working while ill. In his view, only work could bring him comfort. When his condition worsened, he still could not forget the work of preventing and treating leprosy. Just a month before his death, he endured the pain and convened a meeting with officials from Yunnan, Guizhou, and other provinces responsible for leprosy work to discuss cooperation with foreign countries. On his deathbed, already in critical condition, he still asked me to read the materials and letters about leprosy sent from various places. When I read a letter from a leprosy hospital in Guangdong Province, where patients wrote to Old Ma expressing their plight of having only 12 yuan per month for living expenses, eating plain rice every day, and not even having salt water to dip their rice, I saw his tears welling up in his eyes. He was both sad and angry, and asked me to immediately draft a letter to Guangdong Province Governor Ye Xianping, requesting him to handle the matter properly. At that moment, he was running a high fever, and he signed the letter with a trembling hand. In fact, his condition was already very critical, but he was still thinking of others, still thinking of the leprosy patients. He was like a silkworm, wanting to spin the last thread for the cause of the Chinese people, leaving a bright and clean cocoon for the world, and then rest.

	(3)

	In his work, he was very strict with himself and with others. However, in life, he never made any demands. He often recalled the bitter and sweet days in Yan'an and felt very satisfied with the current life. After moving to the city, he lived a very simple life for many years. He loved Chinese food, dumplings, noodles, and dumplings were his staple diet. As for clothing, he was very casual. It was very difficult to add a new piece of clothing or buy a new pair of shoes for him. Until his death, the few pieces of clothing he often wore were all bought by his younger siblings from his American family. He not only lived a frugal life himself but also paid great attention to educating his descendants to be thrifty. He often told his young grandson to save the paper wrappers of books and magazines sent to him, and then slightly process them to make them useful paper. In his view, this not only recycled waste but also provided good education for the children. He always led by example and was consistent in his words and deeds. Therefore, his personal example and teachings had a good influence on the children's habit of thrift. Ma not only lived a frugal life himself but also paid great attention to saving money for the country. He often went abroad for activities, and most of the funds were provided by foreign countries. Last January, India invited him to visit and awarded him the Gandhi International Leprosy Prevention Award, with all expenses paid by the host. However, his health was already very weak at that time, and it was very inappropriate for him to go alone. But he insisted on going alone, not wanting me to accompany him to take care of him, just to save some money for the country. It was only when the organization decided that I must accompany him that he agreed.

	(4)

	The phenomenon of using power for personal gain and seeking privileges, which is hated by the current Chinese people, is also what Ma hates the most.

	In recent years, Ma has been working tirelessly to develop the cause of leprosy prevention in China, traveling abroad to raise a large amount of medical equipment, medicines, and cars. Some people were particularly envious of the cars and came from far away with a lot of gifts, claiming to report on leprosy work. When he realized the purpose of these people, he became furious. Usually gentle and kind Ma suddenly became a different person. He sternly told the visitors, "The cars that should be given to you will be given to you even without these gifts. Those that should not be given will not be given no matter what gifts you bring." After saying that, he ordered them to leave and personally sent them out of the door, fearing that they would leave gifts at the door. These visitors with ulterior motives could only slink away from the door.

	Ma distributed all the cars donated by various countries to the grassroots leprosy prevention stations that needed transportation the most. When a brand new car was given to a county's leprosy prevention unit, it was seized by a certain leader of that county using his power. This matter reached Ma's ears. After being angry, he felt a sense of pain. He decided to fight and would not allow those with power to run amok. In the end, he won. However, accompanying all this, he was plagued by a series of unpleasant thoughts. He was a loyal and upright old Communist Party member who could not tolerate these ugly phenomena.

	(5)

	Ma was not only a good comrade but also a good husband. For 48 years, he loved me, cared for me, and cherished me. We spent a very happy time together.

	Living with him was colorful. We discussed politics, literature, and international issues together. Although we had different views on some specific issues, on all major issues, our views were often the same.

	He strongly supported me in my career. I remember when our son Xiao Ma was only five years old, I had to go to the Northeast to shoot the film "Chinese Children," which required eight months to a year. At that time, I really wanted to go because that was my work. But to be honest, I also didn't want to leave my husband and child. However, Ma was very determined and encouraged me to go to work, telling me to go ahead and not to worry, he would take good care of the child and send me a photo of the child every month. Once he sent me a photo of the child, it was already deep autumn, but the child was dressed very lightly, wearing a long-sleeved shirt with a short-sleeved shirt over it, and the clothes were very messy. Seeing the photo, I was very uneasy. Just then, I received a second letter and a photo of the child from Ma. He said the photo in the previous letter was taken earlier when the weather was not too cold, fearing that I would be unhappy, so he quickly sent a photo of the lively and well-dressed child. He seemed to have already noticed my mood when reading the letter at that time. Maybe it was the effect of the waves, no matter how far apart we were, our hearts were always connected. Of course, every family's life is bound to have some conflicts, this is very natural. Every time we had a small quarrel, he was always willing to do self-criticism. So, in less than an hour, everything would disappear. For 48 years, we have always lived in a very harmonious atmosphere, like honey, spending a long time together.

	Who would have thought that on October 3, 1988, at 9:25 AM, he finally left us, left the cause of the Chinese people to which he had devoted his whole life and all his enthusiasm. He left a will asking our whole family to work harder for the Four Modernizations, saying that this would be the best tribute to him. Lu Xun said, "Bowing my head to be an ox for the children," Ma was a person with such a spirit. He was like an ox, dedicating all his strength to the cause of the Chinese people. Although he is gone, I believe his spirit will forever live in our hearts.

	Rest in peace, dear! The Chinese people will not forget you. The progressive people of the world will not forget you.

　　我亲爱的丈夫——马海德
    苏菲
    去年１０月我亲爱的丈夫马海德突然离开了我们。共同生活了４８年的夫妻忽然分手，这是多么令人难以忍受啊！８个月过去了，然而他的音容笑貌始终伴随着我，他对中国人民事业的献身精神永远激励着我。
    １９４０年在延安，我们冲破了种种传统观念的束缚，终于结合在一起。４８年的共同生活给我带来了多少欢乐，多少幸福，多少鼓舞，多少力量啊！
    　　　　（一）
    马（在生活中我一直这样称呼他）出生在美国纽约州水牛城一个钢铁工人的家庭里。他的祖籍原是黎巴嫩人，他的父亲由于生活所迫１４岁就到美国作童工，后来成为一名炼钢工人。那年头，一个钢铁工人的日子可不好过啊！马的家庭出身，对他产生了深刻的影响，培养了他对被压迫人要求解放的意识。在他２３岁那年，为了支援中国人民的事业，他排除万难，越过重洋，来到中国。后来由于受到马克思主义的影响，他决心投身中国革命。经过宋庆龄女士的介绍，终于在１９３６年参加到中国工农红军的行列。半个多世纪以来，他同中国人民同舟共济，经受了多少个风风雨雨啊！
    在陕北，他的足迹踏遍了每个地方，为陕北军民治病４万余人次，他曾经就陕北的医药状况给毛主席写过一份详尽的调查报告。既肯定了成绩，也指出了问题并提出如何改进的方案。毛主席十分赞赏他这份实事求是的报告，随后便任命他担任革命军事委员会的卫生部顾问，可他不论走到哪里，都以普通一兵自居，谢绝了特殊照顾，更没有半点官架子。
    由于他对中国革命事业的忠诚，在１９３７年２月被吸收加入中国共产党，从此开始了生活中的新篇章。进城后他被任命为卫生部顾问。他除了从事医疗方面的工作外，还经常运用自己在国际上的影响，向全世界宣传新中国的成就，为我们赢得了许许多多的朋友。
    不论是在顺利的时候，还是在困难的时刻，他对中国人民的事业总是满怀信心。在１０动乱中，他受到严重的冲击。他被误解了，受了许多委屈。当时也有些华侨和外国朋友承受不了这种压力，含着热泪离开了中国。我也曾悄悄地问过他：“现在情况这么乱，你动摇过吗？”他问指的什么？我说对党的信念。他坦然地说：“没有过，也不会有的。”他坚信党是伟大的，一个政党能认识自己的错误，并能纠正错误，这就是伟大之所在。“文革”这种做法是错误的，他说：“你等着看吧，将来一定会被纠正的。”当有一些外国朋友被“保护”起来的时候，有一位朋友跑来劝他，带着老婆孩子离开吧。他气愤地说：“干吗离开呀，我热爱这块土地，我热爱这里的人民。”朋友说：“你爱中国，中国并不爱你呀！”他更生气了。瞪起大眼睛质问：“这是谁说的？胡说八道，那只是一小撮坏人搞的，他们才是真正不爱中国人民的坏蛋，我想他们的阴谋一定要失败的”。有一天晚上，他把我叫到房里，严肃地对我说：“万一也把我抓走‘保护’起来的时候，你不要伤心，我没有做过半点对不起党，对不起人民的事，我的心是坦然的，你可要放心，早晚会放我出来的。”马的性格是非常乐观，开朗的，而且很幽默。在１０动乱高潮时，到处揪叛徒，把人的名字倒着写，并打上×，有一天他从外面回来，进门叫我，苏菲，我又长学问了！中国字倒着写，打上×我也能认识了。说完看我脸色很不好，他也马上收起笑容：“是呀！党领导中国革命走向胜利！哪里来这么多叛徒啊？”这是值得思索的问题。当四人帮倒台时，他迅速地把消息去告诉路易·艾黎和米勒大夫，他们３人讨论到半夜。回到家里他还在不断的思索着，这一事件的意义，使他３天３夜不能安眠。
    　　　　（二）
    他是一个把工作看得比自己生命还要重要的人，他常说，我现在必须争分夺秒啊！要充分利用自己有限的生命。所以，这些年来，他一直抱病工作，在他看来，只有工作才能给他带来快慰，当他身体情况恶化的时候，他依然念念不忘处理防治麻风病的有关工作，就在他去世前一个月，他还忍受着病痛，召集云南、贵州等省负责麻风病工作的同志开会，研究同国外合作问题。在病床上，已经是病危的时刻，他还要求我为他读各地寄来的有关麻风病的材料和信件，当我把一封广东省的一所麻风病院患者联名写给马老反映他们每月只有１２元生活费、天天吃白饭、连下饭的盐水都没有的信件念给他听时，我发现他的热泪在眼圈里转，既伤心又气愤，要我立即起草一封信致广东省叶选平省长，请他妥善处理。这时他正发着高烧，他用颤抖的手在信上签了名。其实此刻他的病情已经非常危急了，可他想到的还是别人，想到的还是麻风病患者，他像春蚕一样，要为中国人民的事业吐最后一根丝，把明亮洁白的茧留给人间，而后才肯休息的。
    　　　　（三）
    他在工作上，不论对自己，还是对别人的要求都十分严格，然而在生活上他从来也没有提过什么要求。他经常回忆在延安时那些既苦又甜的日子，对现在的生活感到十分满足。进城后，长年来他生活极为简朴，他很喜欢吃中国菜，馄饨、饺子、面条都是他常用的饭食。至于穿着更是随便，要想给他添一件新衣服或买一双新鞋真是太困难了。直到他去世前，他常穿的几件衣服也都是美国家里的弟弟妹妹们强迫给他添置的。他不但自己一贯俭朴，也十分重视教育子孙节约，他经常要小孙子把寄来的书刊包皮纸保存起来，然后稍稍加工，就可以成为有用的纸了。在他看来，这样不仅是废物利用，而且是对孩子很好的教育。他总是以身作则，言行一致，所以他的身教和言教对孩子养成俭朴的习惯产生了良好的影响。马不但自己生活俭朴，而且十分注意为国家省钱。他经常出国活动，绝大部分的资金是外国提供的。去年１月底，印度邀请他访印授予他甘地国际麻风防治奖，全部费用都是由对方提供。可是当时他的身体已很虚弱，一个人单独出去是很不适宜的，但他仍坚持要只身前往，不要我陪他随身照料，无非是想为国家节约一点钱，直到组织上决定我必须陪往时，他才同意。
    　　　　（四）
    以权谋私，搞特权这些为当前中国人们所痛恨的社会现象，也是马最痛恨的。
    近年来马为发展中国麻风病防治事业，以抱病之身在国外四处奔波，筹募了大量医药器械、药物、汽车等。有人对汽车分外眼红，从遥远的地方，带着大量的礼物，以汇报麻风病工作为名，来探望马。当他弄清楚这些人来的目的后，勃然大怒，素来待人温和厚道的马，霎时间简直变成了另外一个人。他厉声地对来访者说：“该给你们的汽车，不送这么多东西也会分给你们的，不该给的，送任何礼物都没有用。”说罢，就下了逐客令，并亲自送他们出大门，怕他们在大门里留下礼物。这些别有目的的来访者只好灰溜溜地走出了大门口。
    马把各国捐赠的汽车都分给了最需要用交通工具的基层麻防站。当一辆崭新的汽车分给某县麻风病防治单位时，被那县的某领导利用手中的特权把车子扣下了，这件事传到马的耳朵里。他在盛怒之后，感到一种痛苦，他决心要斗争，绝不容许一些手中有特权的人胡来，最后他胜利了。然而伴随着这一切，给他带来的却是一连串的不愉快的思索。他是一个忠实的、正直的老共产党员，他容不得这些丑恶现象。
    　　　　（五）
    马不仅是一位好同志，而且是一位好丈夫。４８年，他始终如一地爱着我，关心着我，体贴着我，我们在一起度过了非常愉快的时光。
    同他在一起生活是丰富多彩的。我们在一起讨论政治、文艺、国际问题，虽然在有些具体问题上，各有各的见解，但在所有大问题上，我们的观点每每是一致的。
    他在事业上非常支持我，记得我们的儿子幼马刚刚五岁时，我因为要去东北拍摄《中华儿女》电影，需要八个月到一年时间，当时我是很想去的，因为那是我的工作。可说心里话，我又舍不得离开丈夫和孩子。但是马的决心很大，鼓励我去工作，要我尽管放心，他会把孩子带的好好的，并要每月给我寄一张孩子的像片。有一次他给我寄了一张孩子的像片，那已是深秋的季节了，可孩子穿的很单薄，长袖衬衣外又套了件短袖衬衫，衣服穿的很零乱。我看了照片心里很不安。正在这时我又接到马寄来的第二封信和孩子的像片。他说前信寄的像片是早已拍摄的，那时天气还不太冷，怕我看了心里不高兴，因此赶快补寄了一张活泼可爱穿戴整齐的孩子像片给我，他好像已经意识到了我当时读家信的心情。也许是电波的作用，不管相隔多么遥远，我们两人的心总是相通的。当然，任何人的家庭生活中总难免发生一些这样和那样的矛盾，这原是很自然的，每当我们闹小别扭的时候，他总是勇于做自我批评。所以不到一小时，一切就都烟消云散了。４８年来，我们一直生活在非常融洽的气氛中，像蜜一样地度过了漫长的岁月。
    谁能料到，１９８８年１０月３日９时２５分，他终于离开了我们，离开了他倾注毕生精力和满腔热忱的中国人民的事业。他留下了遗言要我们全家更努力地为四化献身，说这将是对他最好的纪念。鲁迅先生说：“俯首甘为孺子牛”，马就是具有这种精神的人，他像一头牛似的把自己的全部力量都献给了中国人民的事业，虽然他去了，然而我相信他的精神将永远活在我们心中。
    安息吧，亲爱的！中国人民不会忘记你。国际进步人类也不会忘记你。
