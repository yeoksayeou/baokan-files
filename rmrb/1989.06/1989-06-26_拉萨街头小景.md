	Scenes from the Streets of Lhasa
	Huáng Lúnshēng

	“Clang, clang, clang…” The sound of a gong, not particularly loud. After a moment, in the not overly crowded streets of Lhasa, a hundred or so people gather to watch.

	A monkey showman from Henan, dressed somewhat shabbily, with a rather pitifully small monkey. He bows deeply to the crowd, saying, “It is the winds of reform that have blown me to this ‘Roof of the World’…” Then he goes into his spiel about “at home relying on parents, on the road relying on friends,” and so on. His already raspy voice is even more hoarse due to the high altitude. After a few ordinary tricks, he begins to collect money. Even the Tibetan men from the north, who couldn’t understand a word he said, hand him money. I see the monkey showman’s pocket bulging.

	After the crowd disperses, I strike up a conversation with him.

	“What? You say my opening line isn’t appropriate? Maybe not. But do you know, there are some leaders who, no matter what meeting they’re in, whether it’s related to reform or not, always start with that line? Some even if they can’t connect it, can’t relate it, will still find a way to bring it up. As you say, that’s what’s fashionable. Now, even us monkey showmen on the road have to keep up with the times.”

	His expression is somewhat excited, probably due to the high altitude causing his heart to race.

	“You know, it’s really thanks to these past few years. Otherwise, I wouldn’t even have dreamed of knowing where Lhasa is. In the past, year after year, month after month, stuck at home with just a few acres of land, scraping a living from the earth, barely enough to eat and use, and thinking about going out to see the world, that was just a pipe dream. To be honest, these past few years I’ve almost traveled all over the country, except for Hong Kong and Taiwan. If they give me the paperwork, I’d even dare to go there.

	“You see, it’s not just because of the monkey show. That’s just a side job. Think about it, just traveling around, not earning a bit, always taking from home, that won’t do. This way, I can see the sights and still earn a bit to take home. Farm work? I won’t miss it. During the busy season, I go home; during the slack season, I come out again.

	“Yeah, these past few years I’ve seen a lot of new things. Even a place as high up as Lhasa is developed so well. We have a lot of elderly people back home who don’t even know what a train looks like. In the dance hall, I watched those red and green, bright and flashing lights and felt dizzy. Back home, we can only use oil lamps, and sometimes we have to go through the back door to buy oil.”

	He shakes his head regretfully. The passersby on the street point at us, not knowing what to say. A few bewildered foreigners, with bewildered eyes, stand there for a while, then lose interest and leave.

	“China is so big,” the monkey showman continues from where he left off, “if everywhere were like Beijing, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, it wouldn’t be easy. Even in one family, there are fat and thin. The country is big…”

	My heart stirs.

	“Home? You still have to go back. After all, that’s where you were born and raised. We don’t have it easy out here. Sometimes at night we can’t find a place to stay and have to sleep under the eaves or by the roadside; sometimes we go half a day without eating, that’s common. The goal is to see some of the famous places in the country. I’m thinking, one day, I’ll be like the foreigners, traveling, riding in cars, staying in high-class hotels.”

	I laugh at his words.

	“Really, don’t laugh. Just ask you not to write about me in an article.”

	He walks away. The little monkey jumps onto his shoulder.

	Under a tall billboard, the setting sun shines on his disheveled hair, glinting. A gong sound rings out again, and in a moment, another whirlpool forms in the stream of people.

　　拉萨街头小景
    黄伦生
    “锵锵锵……”不十分响亮的锣声。片刻之后，在不怎么拥挤的拉萨街头也集起百十个人前来围观。
    一个从河南来的耍猴人，衣着不十分整洁，那只猴子也小得可怜。他向四周深施一揖，说道：“是改革之风把俺吹到了这‘世界屋脊’……”下面就是那套“在家靠父母，出门靠朋友”之类的行话。本来就沙哑的嗓子，由于高原缺氧就更沙哑了。几套很平常的“拳术”之后，他开始收钱。刚才连他的一句话怕是也听不懂的藏北汉子也拿出钱给他。我看到耍猴人的一个口袋鼓鼓的。
    人散尽后，我与他搭上了话。
    “什么？你说俺开头那句话不恰当？那也是。但你知道吗，有那么些领导，不管开什么会，不论与改革有没有关系，不都要来上那么一句吗？有的即使连不上，扯不上，绕个弯也要带上。按你们的话说，这叫‘时髦’。如今哪，俺这耍猴走江湖的也时髦一下。”
    他的神情有些激动，我想多半是缺氧引起的心动过速造成的。
    “你还真别说，也多亏这最近几年，不然，做梦也梦不到拉萨在哪里。以往，年年月月守着家门口四指大那块地方，土里刨食，吃的用的都紧巴巴的，还想到外边走走看看，风光风光，那才叫没门呀。不瞒你说，这几年俺全国都快跑遍了，只剩香港、台湾了，如果给俺开‘手续’，俺也敢去。
    “你说，俺靠耍猴才这样，不全是。这只不过是个捎带。你想想，光在外边跑，不挣个仨俩的，总从家里拿可不行。这样可一举两得，一来我可以到处看稀罕；二来还多少挣几个回去。农活？不会误的。忙天，俺回去；闲了，再出来嘛。
    “是呀，这几年是见了不少新鲜事。就连拉萨这么高的地方都建设得这么好。我们家有不少老年人连火车是啥样都不知道。在跳舞厅，我看着那些又红又绿、又明又灭的灯直发慌，在我们家还只能点油灯，有时点灯油也要走后门去买。”
    他不无遗憾地摇摇头。街上的行人都朝我们指指点点，不知道说些什么。几个莫名其妙的外国人，瞪着莫名其妙的眼睛，呆了一会，不感兴趣地去了。
    “全国这么大”，耍猴人接着原来的话茬说，“如果都像北京、广州、深圳啥的也不容易啊。一家兄弟几个还有胖瘦呢。国家大呀……”
    我的心不由动了一下。
    “家？还是要回的。那毕竟是生我养我的地方。俺们出来也不容易。有时夜里找不到住宿的地方，只有睡房檐底下，马路边上；有时一半天吃不上饭也是常有的事。目的是想看看全国有名的地方。俺思谋着，总有一天，咱也像外国人一样，出去旅游坐小车，住高级宾馆。”
    我被他的话逗笑了。
    “真的，你不要笑。只是求你别把俺写到文章里就行了。”
    他走了。那只小猴子一下跳在了他的肩头。
    在一个高大的广告牌下，夕阳照着他蓬乱的头发，闪着亮光。一棒锣声又起，片刻工夫，又聚起一个人流中的旋涡。
