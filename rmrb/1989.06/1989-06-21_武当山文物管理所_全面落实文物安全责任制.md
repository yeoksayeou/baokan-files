The Wudangshan Cultural Relics Administration Bureau in Danjiangkou City has implemented the "Cultural Relics Protection Law" by using economic measures to promote a cultural relics safety contract responsibility system, ensuring that cultural relics safety work is effectively carried out.

In recent years, the bureau has overseen more than 700 ancient buildings and thousands of cultural relics without any incidents, and has been commended multiple times by higher authorities. At the beginning of this year, in response to the severe situation of major cultural relics theft cases, they strictly arranged for cultural relics safety work. On one hand, they selected personnel to strengthen the force, forming a dedicated security team consisting of four cadres and five security personnel; on the other hand, they established and improved the safety inspection system, conducting a major inspection once a month, a minor inspection once a decade, and organizing self-inspections at various points every week. Problems are promptly rectified, and potential hazards are eliminated in their infancy. For the "three teams" of workers who are permanently stationed at the temples and monasteries for construction, they issued "three certificates" (temporary household registration, temporary work permit, and entry permit), implemented named construction, and worked with certificates to block loopholes.

The contract stipulates that based on the effectiveness of the safety "four-prevention" measures of the contracted unit, whether there are any fire or theft hazards, and whether any accidents occur, rewards and punishments will be implemented, and the contract will be settled at the end of the year. Currently, the cultural relics administration bureau has signed cultural relics safety contracts with 19 cultural relics scenic spots.

　　武当山文物管理所    
    全面落实文物安全责任制
    本报讯丹江口市武当山文管所在贯彻落实《文物保护法》过程中，运用经济手段，推行文物安全承包责任制，使文物安全工作落到了实处。
    近几年来，这个所所辖７００余间古建筑和数千件文物没有发生任何事故，多次受到上级部门表彰。年初，他们针对今年重大文物盗窃案的严峻形势，从严部署文物安全工作。一方面抽调人员加强力量，组成一支有４名干部和５名安全员的专职内保队伍；另一方面建立健全安全检查制度，一月一大查，一旬一小查，每周组织各点自查，发现问题及时整改，将事故隐患消灭在萌芽状态。对于常驻庙观施工的“三队”人员，办理“三证”（临时户口、临时工作证、出入证），实行挂牌施工，带证干活，堵绝了漏洞。
    承包合同书规定，根据承包单位安全“四防”措施是否得力，有无火、盗隐患和事故发生等情况进行奖惩，年终兑现。目前文管所已与所属１９个文物景点签订了文物安全承包合同。
