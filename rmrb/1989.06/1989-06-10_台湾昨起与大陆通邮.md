Taiwan began direct mail service to mainland China yesterday.

According to a decision made by the Taiwan "Administrative Yuan's Mainland Affairs Council" on June 6, Taiwanese citizens can now directly dial mainland China and send letters to their mainland relatives without having to go through the Taiwan Red Cross for forwarding.

Taiwan's "Ministry of Transportation and Communications Director-General" Wang Chengyun stated yesterday that telephone and telegraph services to mainland China will be automatically routed through third-party regions such as Japan and the United States. The ministry is also in negotiations with telecommunications agencies in Hong Kong and Singapore to increase the telecommunications network to mainland China. Additionally, the Taiwan Telecommunications Bureau has set up a direct-dial, Taiwan-pays telephone line to mainland China.

The Taiwan "Postal Bureau" also announced yesterday that starting from June 10, procedures for sending mail to mainland China will be simplified, and additional services such as registered mail will be provided.

According to reports, since Taiwan allowed indirect communication with mainland China last March, by the end of May, cross-strait communication had reached over 8 million letters, with 3,690,000 letters sent from Taiwan to mainland China and 4,478,000 letters sent from mainland China to Taiwan. Additionally, 10,069 telegrams were sent from mainland China to Taiwan.

　　台湾昨起与大陆通邮
    新华社香港６月１０日电  台北消息：根据台湾“行政院大陆工作会报”本月６日通过的一项决议，台湾民众从今日起可以向大陆直拨电话，寄给大陆亲友的信件也可以直接写明收件人的姓名地址，不必再经由台湾红十字会转寄。
    台湾“交通部电信总局局长”汪承运昨天表示，通往大陆的电话、电报将由第三地区日本及美国的电信机构自动转接，该局也正在与香港和新加坡等电信机构接洽，希望透过上述地区增加通往大陆的电信网络。此外，台湾电信局还装设了一条大陆拨号台湾付费的电话线。
    台湾“邮政总局”昨天并宣布，自１０日起简化寄大陆信件手续，同时增加挂号交寄等通信项目。
    据报道，台湾自去年３月开放大陆间接通信以来，截至５月底，两岸通信已达８００多万封，其中台湾寄往大陆的有３６９万多封，大陆寄往台湾的有４４７８０００余封。从大陆发至台湾的电报达１００６９件。
