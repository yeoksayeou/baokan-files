Macao Governor Signs Order into Effect

Chinese Becomes Official Language in Macao

Xinhua News Agency, Macao, June 21 — An order signed by Macao Governor Carlos D'Abreu regarding the use of Chinese has come into effect starting June 20.

Under this order, Macao residents can use either Portuguese or Chinese when communicating with government departments. All official documents, forms, and similar materials issued by government agencies must be printed in both Portuguese and Chinese. When the government publishes laws, decrees, orders, and directives in Portuguese, the Chinese translations must be published simultaneously. Legal proposals, decrees, and draft orders submitted to the consultative council must be presented in both Chinese and Portuguese.

For a long time, Portuguese has been the sole official language in Macao, while 97% of the population, who are Chinese, use Chinese as their mother tongue. Since Macao entered the transitional period, calls for Chinese to become an official language have grown louder.

　　澳督签署法令生效    
    中文成为澳门法定语文
    新华社澳门６月２１日电  澳门总督文礼治签署的关于使用中文的法令，从６月２０日起生效。
    这项法令生效后，澳门居民可以使用葡文或中文与各政府部门交往；各政府机构印制的所有印件、表格及同类文件，必须使用葡文及中文；政府以葡文颁布各项法律、法令、训令及批示时，必须连同中译本一起刊登；提交咨询会的法律提案、法令及训令草案，均应以中、葡文提出。
    长期以来，葡文一直是澳门唯一的官方语文，而占澳门人口９７％的居民则是以中文作为母语的。澳门进入过渡时期以来，要求使中文早日成为法定语文的呼声越来越高。
