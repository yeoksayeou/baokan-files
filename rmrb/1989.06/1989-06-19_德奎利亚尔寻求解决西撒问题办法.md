United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar arrived here this afternoon, seeking solutions to the Western Sahara problem.

De Cuéllar said at the airport that he was pleased to come to Morocco to discuss with King Hassan II and the Moroccan authorities to find a fair and lasting solution to the Western Sahara problem as soon as possible. He also said that he had high hopes for this visit and would visit Mauritania, possibly Mali and Algeria, and meet with members of the Polisario Front.

When asked about the obstacles to holding a referendum in Western Sahara, De Cuéllar said, "To say there are obstacles is an exaggeration. We are implementing the plan we proposed to all parties, eliminating possible difficulties, and preparing the conditions."

De Cuéllar concluded, "Everyone directly or indirectly involved knows about this plan. What we are doing is to advance the process of solving the problem and obtain the clarifications I need."

It is reported that Morocco and the Polisario Front accepted the United Nations peace plan for Western Sahara in Geneva on August 30 last year. The plan mainly stipulates that after a ceasefire is declared, a self-determination referendum will be held under the supervision of the United Nations in Western Sahara.

　　德奎利亚尔寻求解决西撒问题办法
    新华社拉巴特６月１８日电  联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天下午抵达这里，寻求西撒问题的解决办法。
    德奎利亚尔在机场发表讲话说，他愉快地前来摩洛哥同哈桑二世国王和摩洛哥当局商谈，以便尽早地为西撒问题找到一项公正和持久的解决办法。他还说，他对这次访问寄予很大希望，并将访问毛里塔尼亚，可能还要访问马里和阿尔及利亚，还将会晤西撒人阵成员。
    在被问到关于在西撒举行公民投票还会有障碍的问题时，德奎利亚尔说：“说有障碍，这言过其实了，我们正在实施我们向各方提出的计划，消除可能遇到的困难，并准备条件。”
    德奎利亚尔最后说：“所有直接或间接相关的人都知道这个计划，我们正在尽力做的是要推进解决问题的进程和获得我所需要的各种澄清。”
    据悉，摩洛哥和西撒人阵于去年８月３０日在日内瓦都接受了联合国关于西撒问题的和平计划，这项计划主要规定在宣布停火后在联合国的监督下在西撒举行自决公民投票。
