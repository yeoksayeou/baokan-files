The president of a country is usually wealthy. However, according to foreign news agencies that have compiled and compared relevant statistics, the late Sankara is an exception; he can be called the poorest president in the world.

Sankara was the president of Burkina Faso in Africa and died in 1987. According to official statistics from his country, Sankara's monthly salary at the beginning of his presidency was 138,000 CFA francs, and his wife's monthly salary was 54,000 CFA francs. The two of them had to support their elderly parents and raise 15 children. With only 192,000 CFA francs, they had to support 19 people. Even with simple meals, they could only barely make ends meet.

Sankara's assets consisted of only one ordinary house purchased on an installment plan, which was of average standard in his country. For this, the president owed 360,000 CFA francs in debt. His home had a television, a refrigerator, and a broken freezer. They had two racing bicycles. Additionally, there was a Nissan sedan provided by the government for his commute. Even for an ordinary family, these assets were quite meager. Many people had repeatedly expressed the desire to improve the president's living conditions, arguing that this was beneficial to the country and its people, but all were firmly rejected by President Sankara.

Sankara's frugal lifestyle was because he was determined to lead by example in promoting a nationwide campaign for clean governance. Just by looking at a few major events during his tenure, one can see this clearly.

He came to power in 1983 after leading a successful coup. After taking office, he swiftly punished corrupt officials. He sharply pointed out: "In the process of promoting clean governance, the corruption of government officials is the most dangerous threat to the country and even to Africa today!" He established the "National Anti-Corruption Commission" and organized a powerful team to focus on investigating cases of corruption, smuggling, and bribery from local to central officials.

He led by example for the entire nation. Someone gave him four different models of luxury cars, and he handed them all over to the government. Someone offered him a large sum of money, and he returned it intact to the government. Most impressively, this president not only refused to accept "ill-gotten wealth" but also voluntarily gave up the substantial allowances that came with his position. He even reduced his already meager salary several times to share the hardships with his people.

    最“穷”的总统
    ●柯　谱　宝　成
    为一国总统者，大多家资殷富。然而据外电在综合比较有关统计材料后报道，已故的桑卡拉是个例外，他可称世界最“穷”的总统。
    桑卡拉是非洲布基纳法索的总统，1987年丧生。据该国官方统计，桑卡拉任总统之初的月薪为13.8万非洲法郎，他的夫人月薪才5.4万非洲法郎。他俩要奉养年迈双亲，更要养活15个子女，区区19.2万非洲法郎，济济19人生活，即使粗茶淡饭，也只能维持温饱而已。
    桑卡拉的家产只有一处以分期付款方式购买的平平常常的住宅，在该国属中等水平。为此，总统曾欠下36万非洲法郎债务。他家里有部电视机，一个冷藏柜，一台坏了的冰箱。他们有两辆比赛用的自行车。另外，还有一辆日产小轿车，是政府供他上下班使用的。这些家产就是对一般家庭来说，也是相当清寒的。有人曾多次表示要改善一下总统生活起居，并振振有词地说明这是利国益民之举，均被桑卡拉总统坚决拒绝了。
    桑卡拉总统之所以安贫乐道，是因为他决心以身作则来推动全国的为政清廉运动。只要看看他执政后的几件大事就可见一斑了。
    他是在1983年领导一次成功的政变后上台的。他上台后，雷厉风行地严惩了贪官污吏。他尖锐地指出：“在大力推行廉政治国中，政府官员的贪赃枉法是国家乃至如今非洲最危险的祸患！”桑卡拉成立了“全国反贪污委员会”，组织了强有力的班子，重点审查从地方到中央的官吏的贪污、走私、受贿等经济案件。
    他本人以身作则，为全国表率。有人赠给他四辆不同型号的豪华小轿车，他全都交公。有人塞给他钱，数额甚巨，他也原封不动地交给政府。最令人折服的是，这位总统不光“不义之财，分文莫取”，而且还将份内之财的巨额职务津贴主动放弃，还不只一次自减那本已十分微薄的薪水，以体现与民同甘共苦。
