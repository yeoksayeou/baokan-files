	San Jose, June 14: U.S. Vice President Quayle stated on June 14 in Costa Rica that if the Organization of American States delegation fails to mediate the Panamanian crisis, the United States will adopt "new choices" to deal with Panama.

	Vice President Quayle made these remarks as he concluded his visits to Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, and Costa Rica. During his Central American tour, which began on June 11, he discussed the peace process in Central America and the situation in Panama with the leaders of the four countries.

	Quayle said, "Noriega must step down because the Panamanian people oppose him." He added, "The sooner Noriega steps down, the better it will be not only for the Panamanian people but also for the people of Central America." He stated that some governments in Central America and Latin America share the same view.

	In his speech, Quayle also launched a fierce attack on the Nicaraguan government. He said that the Bush administration is "concerned" about the possibility of a "Nicaragua-Cuba-Panama" alliance.

	According to another report, the Organization of American States delegation, which is mediating the Panamanian crisis, concluded its second visit to Panama on June 14 but has yet to find a solution to reconcile the Panamanian government with the opposition.

　　同四国领导人讨论中美洲及巴拿马局势后
    奎尔结束中美洲之行
    新华社北京６月１５日电  圣何塞消息：美国副总统奎尔１４日在哥斯达黎加表示，如果美洲国家组织代表团调解巴拿马危机失败，美国将会采取“新的选择”来对付巴拿马。
    奎尔副总统是在结束了对危地马拉、洪都拉斯、萨尔瓦多和哥斯达黎加的访问时讲这番话的。他在从本月１１日开始的中美洲之行中，同４国领导人讨论了中美洲和平进程及巴拿马局势等问题。
    奎尔说，“诺列加必须下台，因为巴拿马人民反对他。”“诺列加早日下台，不但对巴拿马人民而且对中美洲人民都有好处。”他说，中美洲和拉美的一些政府也持有同样观点。
    奎尔在讲话中还对尼加拉瓜政府进行了猛烈攻击。他说，布什政府对“可能”出现一个“尼加拉瓜—古巴—巴拿马”联盟“深感忧虑”。
    另据报道，调解巴拿马危机的美洲国家组织代表团１４日结束了对巴拿马的第２次访问，但仍未找到使巴拿马政府与反对派和解的方案。
