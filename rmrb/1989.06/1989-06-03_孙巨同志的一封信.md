Editors' Note: This is a letter written by Comrade Sun Ju to the responsible comrades of relevant departments of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. It is published as follows.

We are a group of ordinary Communist Party members. We are extremely indignant after reading the small news item titled "A Glimpse of Tiananmen Square on Children's Day" on the front page of today's (June 2nd) People's Daily!

"Glimpse" and the "Day X of Martial Law" are of the same ilk, supporting each other; after "Day X" was forced to stop, its ghost reappears. This is another piece of malicious text that uses the "Spring and Autumn Annals" style to distort right and wrong, confuse black and white, stubbornly stands on the opposite side of the central decision, continues to support the instigators of the turmoil, and defames the martial law order of the Beijing Municipal Government.

See for yourself: Clearly, some people are openly defying the regulations and martial law of the municipal government, continuing to occupy the square, turning the sacred square symbolizing the republic into a chaotic and filthy "epicenter," seriously damaging the city's appearance, disrupting the normal life order of citizens, and making it impossible for innocent children to hold normal activities on Tiananmen Square on Children's Day; yet the author of the text maliciously depicts a harmonious scene of students with children exchanging gifts, "sharing joy," and even "posing for photos."

Clearly, after martial law, it was stipulated that Zhongshan Park and the Workers' Cultural Palace would temporarily close, yet the author of the text intentionally uses the words of a "parent" to hint at the martial law order, inciting and venting dissatisfaction with the martial law order.

The text specifically mentions how the tents of the Central Academy of Fine Arts are set up. Who doesn't know that it is a small number of people from the Central Academy of Fine Arts who have recently brazenly violated public opinion, trampled on the law, and illegally erected that unseemly goddess statue. These people have become the "most beloved people" in your minds?

We want to ask the author of the text and the person who approved the publication: Do you still want to plant the seeds of turmoil into the innocent minds of children? Do you think those who continue to sit in front of Tiananmen Square are heroes of the republic or people who violate the laws and regulations of the republic? Are you incompetent and causing trouble for the suppression of the turmoil, or do you have ulterior motives and insist on the wrong stance of "resisting to the end"?

The People's Daily is a newspaper of the Central Committee of the Party, not a newspaper that some gentlemen of the People's Daily can do as they please. In any case, the high image of the Party Central Committee's organ newspaper cannot be used to boost the morale of anti-Party and anti-socialist turmoil!

### 孙巨同志的一封信

    孙巨同志的一封信
    编者按：这是孙巨同志写给中共中央有关部门负责同志的一封信，现刊登如下。
    我们是一批普通共产党员。看了今天（6月2日）人民日报头版上花边新闻《“六一”天安门广场一瞥》十分气愤！
    “一瞥”与人民日报的“戒严第×日”同出一辙，前后呼应；在“第×日”被迫停止后再现其阴魂，这又是一篇用“春秋笔法”颠倒黑白、混淆是非、顽固站在中央决策对立面，继续给动乱制造者们撑腰打气，给北京市人民政府戒严令抹黑的恶毒文字。
    请看：明明是一些人公然违抗市政府的规定和戒严令，继续占据广场，把具有共和国象征的神圣广场变成了乱糟糟、臭烘烘的“病灶”，严重破坏了北京市容，干扰了市民正常生活秩序，使得天真可爱的儿童六一节都不能来天安门广场举行正常活动；而文字的作者却别有用心描绘了一幅在天安门的学生同小朋友和谐相处，授受礼品，“共欢乐”甚至“合影留念”的“感人”景象。
    明明是戒严后规定了中山公园和劳动人民文化宫暂停开放，文字的作者却有意借一位“家长”之口影射戒严令，煽动和发泄对戒严令的不满。
    文字特别提到中央美术学院的帐篷如何如何。谁人不知，正是中央美院的极少数人，最近明目张胆强奸民意，践踏法律，非法垒搭了那个不伦不类的女神像。这些人倒成了你们心目中的“最可爱的人”？
    我们要问文字的作者和批准文字出笼的先生：你们还想把动乱的罪恶种子播进孩子们幼小的心灵中吗？你们认为继续坐在天安门前的那些人是共和国的英雄还是违犯共和国法律、法规的人？你们是水平不高而给平息动乱出难题，还是别有用心，坚持“对抗到底”的错误立场？
    人民日报是党中央办的报纸，不是人民日报的某些先生们想怎么办就怎么办的报纸。无论如何，不能拿党中央机关报的崇高形象为反党反社会主义的动乱助长气焰！
