In Stockholm's Music Hall, during a press conference, a young Swedish girl raised her hand, eagerly looking at the host, Swedish Prime Minister Carlsson, on stage. Noticing the girl's television station sign, the Prime Minister immediately raised his voice to announce, "Next, the children's television news reporter will ask questions."

This was a scene from a press conference held at the beginning of this year in Sweden to honor UN Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar with the Palme Memorial Award.

Twelve-year-old Charlotta Praz held the microphone and, under the gaze of more than 100 reporters from various countries, confidently walked onto the stage and stood beside Pérez de Cuéllar. She asked a series of questions in fluent English: "There are still wars and bloodshed in the world. What can we children do for the cause of peace?" "When we grow up, will the world be more peaceful than it is now?" "Do you have confidence in achieving world peace?" ... The UN Secretary-General answered these questions seriously. This dialogue attracted the attention of those present and also the audience watching the children's television news program at home.

At Malmo Television Station, we specially interviewed the host of this program, Bente Forstrom. He had studied child psychology at university and had been a middle school teacher for three years. He introduced that the children's television news program began in August 1972. Because children are full of curiosity, especially those aged 9 to 14, who are eager to understand the world and can ask all kinds of questions. Ordinary television news, whether in language or content, cannot meet their needs. After establishing the children's television news program, it was not only welcomed by children but also by adult "big kids." This was beyond their expectations.

Bente said that he hosted this program with the aim of letting children know that "this world is full of tragedies, but also full of hope." The program is scheduled every Saturday evening during prime time, lasting half an hour each time. For the first ten minutes, Bente explains the major news events of the week in simple and humorous language, and then broadcasts the interviews conducted by the young reporters.

There are six young reporters, aged 11 to 14. To let more children share the opportunity, each young reporter can only serve for one year. Every spring, the television station receives tens of thousands of letters from children applying to be young reporters.

"What kind of children can become young reporters?" the reporter asked.

"The children's program editing department selects 200 out of the children's letters, then visits the children and their parents and teachers in various places to make the final selection. In addition to the child having excellent academic performance and support from parents and teachers, the most important thing is that he or she is willing to serve others. Because being a young reporter often takes up after-school time," Bente said.

"How do you arrange the young reporters' interviews?"

"The editing department has three people responsible for organizing this program, and there are also more than 50 child commentators across the country. After each program is broadcast, we call the commentators to evaluate the program and suggest improvements for future programs. These children can come up with many good ideas that we never thought of. We select some of them and discuss with the young reporters to stimulate their interest. Then, the young reporters themselves arrange the interview plans, such as the interview method and what questions to ask, all decided by the young reporters themselves. We provide only a small amount of guidance and respect the children's ideas as much as possible, making the program more in line with children's psychology."

"What content do children like to watch the most?" "First, it's news related to animals. Children are most concerned about rare animals in the world, and if someone hurts them, it can make children very angry. Second, it's about the situation of children in other countries, for example, in a country like China, how are children educated? How do children in various countries entertain themselves? They also care about major events happening in the world, such as the U.S. presidential election. Children are particularly interested in the dialogues between young reporters and famous figures at home and abroad. Young reporters have interviewed the Swedish King, Prime Minister, CEOs of large companies, Nobel Prize winners, tennis stars, rock stars... Most of the interviews were very successful."

Bente pointed to a large pile of letters and said, "Some of these are letters of praise from parents and teachers, and many are from children expressing their views on the program. I think the program is attractive because it is important to develop children's creativity, making the program full of innocence and natural childishness, avoiding adultification."

Currently, this program has 1.5 million young viewers. Some European countries' television stations often broadcast this program. In the European Children's Television Program Competition, the Swedish Children's Television News was awarded the best program.

　　让孩子们了解世界
    ——瑞典儿童电视新闻侧记
    和平
    在斯德哥尔摩音乐厅举行的一次记者招待会上，一名瑞典小姑娘举起了小手，以急切的眼光注视着台上的主持人瑞典首相卡尔松。首相注意到这名女孩手中的电视台标志牌，立即提高嗓音宣布：“下面由儿童电视新闻记者提问题。”
    这是今年年初，在瑞典为联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔荣获帕尔梅纪念奖举行记者招待会上的一个场景。
    １２岁的查尔帕特·普拉兹举着话筒，在来自各国的１００多名记者的注视下，大大方方地走上讲台，站到德奎利亚尔身旁，用流利的英语提了一连串问题：“现在世界上还有战争和流血，你认为我们儿童能对和平事业做些什么？”“等我们长大了，世界会比现在安宁吗？”“你对实现世界和平有信心吗？”……联合国秘书长对这些问题都作了认真的回答。这场对话吸引了在场的人们，也吸引了坐在电视机旁观看儿童电视新闻节目的观众。
    在马尔默电视台，我们特意采访了这个节目的主持人本特·福尔斯特隆姆。他曾在大学学过儿童心理学，当过三年中学教员。他介绍，儿童电视新闻节目始于１９７２年８月。由于孩子们充满着求知欲，特别是９至１４岁的孩子急于想了解世界，可以提出各种各样的问题。通常的电视新闻无论从语言还是内容都不能适应他们的需求。设立儿童电视新闻节目后，不仅受到儿童们的欢迎，连成年的“大孩子”也爱看。这是他们始料不及的。
    本特说，他主持这个节目，旨在让孩子们知道“这个世界充满着悲剧，但又充满着希望。”节目安排在每星期六晚上的黄金时间，每次半小时。头十分钟由本特用浅显易懂而又风趣的语言讲解一周来世界上发生的重大新闻，然后播放小记者采访的节目。
    小记者共有６名，年龄在１１至１４岁。为了让更多的孩子分享机会，每个小记者只能当一年。每年春天电视台收到上万封儿童来信，要求当小记者。
    “什么样的孩子才能当小记者呢？”笔者问。
    “电视台儿童节目编辑部从儿童来信中选出２００名，然后到各地找孩子及家长、老师谈话，从中挑选。除孩子本人学习成绩优秀，家长、老师都支持外，最重要的是他（她）愿意为大家服务。因为当小记者要经常占用课外时间。”本特说。
    “你们是怎样安排小记者采访活动的？”
    “编辑部有三人负责组织这个节目，另外还有５０多名特约儿童评论员，分布在全国各地。每次节目播完后，我们就分头给评论员打电话，请他们对节目评分，并对今后的节目提出建议。这些孩子可以提出很多我们根本没有想到的好主意。我们从中选出一部分后，同小记者商量，启发他们的兴趣。然后由小记者自己安排采访计划，如采访方式，提什么问题，都由小记者自己决定。我们除了提供少量辅导外，尽量尊重孩子们的想法，这样节目更富于儿童心理。”
    “哪些内容孩子们最爱看？”“首先，是与动物有关的新闻。孩子们最关心世界上珍奇的动物，谁如果伤害它们，可以使孩子们非常愤怒。其次，是关于其他国家儿童的情况，比如像中国这样的国家，儿童是怎样受教育的？世界各国儿童是怎样娱乐的？也关心世界发生的大事，如美国总统大选。孩子们对小记者与国内外知名人士对话特别有兴趣。小记者采访过瑞典国王、首相、大公司总裁、诺贝尔奖获得者、网球明星、摇滚乐歌星……大部分采访搞得很成功。”
    本特指着一大堆信说：“这里有些是家长和老师的赞扬信，大量是孩子们谈对节目看法。我想这个节目之所以有吸引力，重要的是要注意发挥儿童的创造性，让节目充满天真、自然的孩子气，避免大人化。”
    目前，这个节目拥有小观众１５０万名。一些欧洲国家的电视台也常转播这个节目。在欧洲儿童电视节目比赛中，瑞典儿童电视新闻曾被评为最佳节目。
