Currently, in the Soviet sports community, there is a heated debate on the issue of professionalizing athletes. On one side, there is world chess champion Garry Kasparov, and on the other, there is men's pole vault world record holder Sergey Bubka. Both have expressed their views on the value of competitive sports and the growing trend of professionalization in Soviet sports.

Kasparov first published an article in the magazine *Fakel*, advocating for the opening of sports to professionalization. In response, Bubka published a strong rebuttal in *Soviet Sports*, accusing Kasparov of having "personal ambitions" and aiming to create headlines and belittle the philosophical ideas of sports.

Former world women's foil champion Elena Belova wrote in *Fakel* that "the most important significance of sports lies in improving the health of the masses. Unfortunately, this idea has been overshadowed by the emphasis on competitive sports. Today, sports have become a state within a state, with dual morality and full of deception." She said, "Privileged competitive athletes find it difficult to adapt to normal life after retirement." Belova also opposed using the level of competitive sports as a symbol of progress, stating, "We do not need a youth army whose intellectual level has stagnated, nor do we need champions achieved at any cost."

Former Olympic cross-country skiing gold medalist Raisa Smetanina, after her sixteen-year competitive sports career, said, "I don't know how to live after leaving sports."

　　辩论体育职业化利弊
    同是明星　见解各异
    目前，在苏联体育界就运动员职业化问题正在进行激烈地辩论。以世界象棋冠军卡斯帕罗夫为一方，男子撑竿跳世界纪录保持者布勃卡为另一方，对竞技体育的价值和在苏联日趋增长的体育职业化各述己见。
    卡斯帕罗夫首先在《火炬》杂志上发表文章，鼓吹体育向职业化开放，接着布勃卡在《苏联体育报》上给予强硬的回答，指责卡斯帕罗夫有“个人野心”，说他希望创头条新闻和贬低体育的哲学思想。
    前世界女子花剑冠军尤伯茨卡娅在《火炬》杂志上发表文章说：“体育最重要的意义在于提高群众的健康水平，遗憾的是这种思想目前由于偏重竞技体育让人们给忘掉了。当今的体育成了国中之国，它具有双重道德，充满了欺骗。她说：“享受着特权的竞技运动员，当他们退役之后很难适应正常人的生活。”尤伯茨卡娅还反对把竞技体育水平作为进步的象征，她说，人们不需要那些思想水平停留在原处的青年大军，不需要不惜用任何代价去换取的冠军。
    前奥运会越野滑雪金牌获得者斯梅塔妮娅，在她从事十六年竞技体育生涯之后说：“我不知道，在我离开体育之后怎样生活。”
