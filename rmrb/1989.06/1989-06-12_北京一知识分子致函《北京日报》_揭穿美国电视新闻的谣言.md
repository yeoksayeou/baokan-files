Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 12th.

A middle-aged intellectual from Haidian District, Beijing, wrote a letter to the *Beijing Daily* on June 9th, exposing a lie spread by American television news. The full text of the letter is as follows:

To the editors:

On the evening of June 7th, a relative of mine called from the United States, sounding very anxious, asking about the situation at Peking University. He said he had heard from American television news that the martial law troops had entered Peking University and killed over 150 people. He was very worried. Coincidentally, my neighbor's child also studies at Peking University and had just returned from there. There was absolutely no truth to the claim that the military had entered the university and killed over 100 people. I explained the situation to him.

I really don't understand why American news agencies would publicly spread such lies, incite their audience, and create confusion? They always talk about how news should be true and free. Is fabricating lies what they mean by "news truth"? Is spreading false information what they call "news freedom"? What is their intention in doing this? I hope to use your newspaper to publicly expose this, so that they can be exposed to the light of day, and let people see what kind of tricks their rumor-mongering company is up to.

### 北京一知识分子致函《北京日报》  揭穿美国电视新闻的谣言

　　北京一知识分子致函《北京日报》
    揭穿美国电视新闻的谣言
    新华社北京６月１２日电  北京市海淀区一位中年知识分子６月９日给《北京日报》写信，揭穿美国电视新闻的一个谣言。信件全文如下：
    编辑同志：６月７日晚，我的一位亲戚从美国打回一个长途电话，心急火燎地询问北京大学的情况。他说，他从美国电视新闻中得知，戒严部队已经开进北京大学，打死１５０多人。他很担心。正巧，我邻居的孩子也在北大上学，刚才去过北大，根本没有解放军开进高校打死１００多人的事。我向他说明了情况。
    我真不懂，美国的新闻单位为什么如此公开造谣，煽惑观众，搅乱视听？他们不是口口声声说新闻要真实要自由吗？难道编造谎言就是他们所标榜的“新闻真实”？信口胡言就是他们自诩的“新闻自由”？他们这样干，到底是何居心？我希望能借贵报的一角，予以公开揭露，也好让他们曝曝光，让人们看看他们的造谣公司，到底干了些什么勾当。
