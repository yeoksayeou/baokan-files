The PLA's General Departments and Major Units Resolutely Support the Decisions of the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee, Making New Contributions to the Long-Term Stability and Prosperity of the Country

The General Departments and major units of the People's Liberation Army have thoroughly studied and discussed the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee, resolutely supporting the decisions made by the Plenum. They are determined, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, to make new contributions to the long-term stability and prosperity of the country and the victory of the Four Modernizations.

The General Staff Department, General Political Department, and General Logistics Department each held meetings today to convey and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee. General Staff Director Ye Xianying, Director of the General Political Department Yang Baibing, and Director of the General Logistics Department Zhao Nanqi each spoke at the meetings. They demanded that the leadership of the General Departments deeply study the spirit of the Fourth Plenum, further unify their thoughts, raise their awareness, and lead the entire army to implement the various tasks proposed by the Central Committee with practical actions.

On the evening of the 24th, leaders and staff of the Beijing Military Region, Shenyang Military Region, Jinan Military Region, Nanjing Military Region, Guangzhou Military Region, Chengdu Military Region, Lanzhou Military Region, Air Force, Navy, Second Artillery Corps, Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, National Defense University, and Academy of Military Sciences carefully watched and listened to the news and communiqué of the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee, organizing learning and discussion throughout the night. On the 25th, various major units held meetings to convey and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenum. The units generally agreed that the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee was held at a crucial moment when the counter-revolutionary rebellion had been suppressed, making it a very important meeting. It plays a significant role in stabilizing the national situation and will have a profound impact on ensuring the continuity of the Party's line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee, and on continuing to implement the basic line of "one central task, two fundamental points" proposed by the 13th Party Congress.

During the study, everyone linked the severe facts of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing to discuss how Zhao Ziyang, at a crucial moment concerning the life and death of the Party and the country, committed the error of supporting the turmoil and splitting the Party. His errors are extremely serious, and the consequences are severe. For a long time, he seriously neglected Party building, did not focus on ideological and political work and the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, passively opposed the adherence to the Four Cardinal Principles, supported and indulged in bourgeois liberalization, causing serious damage to the Party's cause. The Plenum's decision to remove him from his positions as General Secretary and other posts, and to continue investigating his problems, is completely necessary and correct. This will make our Party more united and more combat-ready. The facts once again prove that our Party has the ability to solve its own problems and lead and govern our country.

Comrades believe that the Plenum has made adjustments to some members of the Central Leadership, electing Jiang Zemin as the Party's General Secretary. This is a correct decision to strengthen the core leadership of the Party Central Committee, ensuring the continuity and stability of the Party's line, principles, and policies. The formation of the new Central Leadership core makes our Party Central Committee purer, more united, and stronger. With such a strong leadership core, our Party and country have great hope and will surely achieve greater victories in reform and construction.

The vast number of officers and soldiers unanimously agree with the Plenum's high evaluation of the old generation of proletarian revolutionaries represented by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. Everyone believes that in the struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, Deng Xiaoping and other old revolutionaries played a decisive role. Without Deng Xiaoping and other old revolutionaries at the helm, there would not have been the correct line since the Third Plenum of the 11th Central Committee and the great achievements of the reform and opening-up, nor would there have been the great victory of stopping the turmoil and suppressing the rebellion.

Everyone also mentioned that the Fourth Plenum gave a high evaluation of the PLA's contributions in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, which is a great encouragement and motivation for the entire army. The PLA is an armed group absolutely led by the Party and must maintain a high degree of unity with the Party Central Committee, resolutely carrying the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion to the end, and responding to the Party and the people's expectations for the army with practical actions. The Fourth Plenum emphasizes the need to pay special attention to four major tasks, which is in line with the hearts of the Party, the army, and the people, and reflects the Party Central Committee's strategic vision and strong determination to be highly responsible for the country and the nation. The officers and soldiers unanimously expressed that they would work even harder to complete the various tasks assigned by the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission.

　　解放军三总部和各大单位    
    坚决拥护四中全会各项决定  为国家长治久安作出新贡献
    新华社北京６月２５日电  人民解放军各总部、各大单位认真传达、讨论党的十三届四中全会精神，坚决拥护全会作出的各项决定，决心在党中央的领导下，为国家的长治久安和四化建设的胜利进行，不断作出新的贡献。
    总参谋部、总政治部和总后勤部今天分别举行了传达贯彻十三届四中全会精神大会。总参谋长迟浩田、总政治部主任杨白冰、总后勤部长赵南起分别在会上讲了话。他们要求总部领导机关要深入学习四中全会精神，进一步统一思想，提高认识，用实际行动带领全军贯彻落实中央提出的各项任务。
    ２４日晚上，北京军区、沈阳军区、济南军区、南京军区、广州军区、成都军区、兰州军区、空军、海军、第二炮兵、国防科工委、国防大学、军事科学院等单位的领导同志和机关干部认真收看收听了十三届四中全会的新闻和全会公报，连夜组织学习和讨论。２５日，各大单位普遍召开了传达贯彻四中全会精神大会。各单位在讨论中普遍认为，十三届四中全会是在平息反革命暴乱取得重大胜利的时刻召开的一次非常重要的会议，对于当前进一步稳定全国局势具有重大作用，而且对今后保证十一届三中全会以来党的路线、方针、政策的连续性，保证十三大提出的“一个中心、两个基本点”基本路线的继续贯彻执行，将产生深远的影响。
    学习中，大家联系北京发生的反革命暴乱的严峻事实谈到，赵紫阳同志在关系党和国家生死存亡的关键时刻犯了支持动乱和分裂党的错误，其错误性质和造成的后果是极为严重的。长期以来，他严重忽视党的建设，不抓思想政治工作和社会主义精神文明建设，消极对待坚持四项基本原则，支持和纵容资产阶级自由化，给党的事业造成了严重损失。全会决定撤销他的总书记和其他职务，并对他的问题继续进行审查，是完全必要的、正确的。这将使我们党更加团结，更有战斗力。事实再次证明，我们党完全有能力解决好自身的问题，领导和治理好我们的国家。
    同志们认为，四中全会对中央领导机构的部分成员作了调整，选举江泽民同志担任党的总书记，这是加强党中央的核心领导，保证党的路线、方针、政策的连续性和稳定性的正确决策。新的中央领导核心的形成，使我们的党中央更加纯洁，更加团结，更加坚强。有了这样一个坚强的领导核心，我们的党和国家就大有希望，就一定能夺取改革和建设事业的更大胜利。
    广大指战员一致赞成全会对以邓小平同志为代表的老一辈无产阶级革命家的高度评价。大家认为，在制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的斗争中，邓小平等老一辈革命家发挥了决定性的作用。没有邓小平等老一辈革命家掌舵，就不会有党的十一届三中全会以来的正确路线和改革开放事业的巨大成果，也不会有这次制止动乱、平息暴乱的伟大胜利。
    大家还谈到，四中全会对我军在平息反革命暴乱中的贡献作了高度评价，这是对全军指战员的巨大鼓舞和鞭策。我军是党绝对领导下的武装集团，一定要同党中央保持高度一致，坚决把平息反革命暴乱的斗争进行到底，以实际行动回答党和人民对军队的殷切期望。四中全会强调要特别注意抓好的四件大事，符合党心军心民心，体现了党中央在政治战略上的远见卓识和对国家、民族高度负责的坚强决心。指战员们一致表示，一定要更加兢兢业业地做好各项工作，以实际行动完成党中央、中央军委赋予的各项任务。
