The Unfinished Journey (Chapter Two)

Camel Grass

The wind of the ancient road opens a window, a few strands of murky yellow sunlight tremble in through the blue.

Is it calling for a stalk of camel grass?

(Behind the stranded cart is the spine of a boatman who can never stand straight again, and the legend of a once-mighty dragon.)

Daytime is desolate, nighttime is desolate. Through the lighthouse of the oasis, it fades into the prison of the wolves' blazing eyes.

Dust storms once ravaged and still do.

The wind of the ancient road opens a window, a few strands of murky yellow sunlight tremble in through the blue.

A stalk of camel grass steps out, not riding a gilded and silver-plated cart.

Filthy or elegant, cowardly or brave, alive or dead, time only chooses to pass.

Do not abandon the seed to embrace a colorful cloud, stretch out your hands, sprinkle your dew, and cherish a tender stalk of camel grass.

Cut off the clinging and lingering vines, do not let the wolves' howls grow into lush trees, stretch out your hands and sprinkle your blessings, and cherish a tender stalk of camel grass.

Moon Crescent Spring

To yearn for you is to approach you. To approach you is to be amazed by your misfortune and good fortune.

Groups of sand dunes and layers of loneliness swirl around you. Despairing souls, after coming here, long a thousand times to return to despair.

Yet, there were once so many years of rampant moss, so many seasons of mournful wind chimes.

Gurgle, gurgle. Like rain, like tears, oh Moon Crescent Spring!

Leaves are swept up by the hurricane, and the sunset is buried by the dust.

Father's back faces the distant mountains, his promise like the vast journey.

Mother stands on the night shore, her long hair flowing like a waterfall, dancing in the gaze like the first snow of winter.

And now, how many lilac flowers sway in the April breeze, how many idlers fashionably enjoy the August dusk.

Your surroundings are still groups of sand dunes and layers of loneliness, swirling day and night.

Thump, thump. Glittering, like milk, like wine, oh Moon Crescent Spring!

To yearn for you is to approach you. To approach you is to be amazed by your misfortune and good fortune.

Only Father's faltering steps guard loyalty.

Only Mother's flowing white hair guards the promise.

Drip, drip.

Bare your heart in the morning and evening, in every ray of sunlight or sunset, like rain, like tears, like milk, like wine, oh Moon Crescent Spring!

    骆驼草
    古道的风吹开一扇窗，几缕浊黄的阳光透进来颤巍巍的蓝。
    是呼唤一株骆驼草么？
    （搁浅的勒勒车的身后是再也直不起来的纤夫的脊梁以及曾经威武过的龙的传说）
    白昼荒凉，黑夜荒凉，透过绿洲的灯塔泯于野狼灼灼眸子的囹圄。
    尘沙曾经肆虐而今依然依然。
    古道的风吹开一扇窗，几缕浊黄的阳光透进来颤巍巍的蓝。
    走出一株骆驼草未乘镶金镀银的勒勒车。
    龌龊抑或潇洒，懦弱抑或勇敢，生抑或死，时光只选择流逝。
    不要抛弃种子而去拥抱那一片多姿多彩的烟云，伸出你的双手，洒下你的霖露，去抚爱一株嫩嫩的骆驼草吧。
    斩断缠绵和徘徊的藤，不让野狼的嗥叫长成郁郁葱葱的树，伸出你的双手洒下你的祝福，去抚爱一株嫩嫩的骆驼草吧。
    月牙泉
    向往你便走近你。走近你便惊异于你的不幸和万幸。
    成群的沙丘层叠的孤独缭绕于你的四周。绝望者临此尔后渴盼一千次重复地走向绝望。
    而曾经，曾经有过多少青苔泛滥的岁月，曾经有过多少风铃凄切的季节。
    汩汩。晶晶。如霖如泪的月牙泉呵！
    落叶被飓风卷起，夕晖被尘沙掩埋。
    父亲的脊梁背对沉浮的远山，许诺似茫茫苍苍的跋涉。
    母亲伫立夜岸，流瀑似的长发在瞩望中飘曳为深冬的初雪。
    而此刻有多少丁香花婀娜为四月的风流，有多少清闲者时髦为八月的黄昏。
    你的四周依然是成群的沙丘依然是层叠的孤独，日日夜夜地缭绕。
    咚咚。熠熠。如乳如酒的月牙泉呵！　
    向往你便走近你。走近你便惊异于你的不幸与万幸。
    唯父亲蹒跚的步履扼守忠诚。
    唯母亲飘曳的白发扼守许诺。
    淙淙然。淙淙然。
    袒衷情于朝朝暮暮，于每一道曦光抑或夕晖，如霖如泪，如乳如酒的月牙泉呵！
