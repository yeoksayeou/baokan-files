In the past, there was a saying in Hebei Province's Baoding Region: "Party activities are like a gust of wind, disappearing without a trace afterward." How can this situation be fundamentally changed to make "party activities" standardized, systematic, and institutionalized? Recently, the Baoding Regional Committee carefully summarized the experiences of party building over the years and launched the "Branch Upgrade and Member Excellence" activity across the region. This activity implements democratic horizontal and vertical supervision, conducts annual evaluations, and recognizes outstanding or excellent performers. Those who are lax in party discipline or have poor party conduct are either transferred, removed, or otherwise dealt with.

During this activity, every party member in the region carefully reviewed their thoughts, work, and style over the past few years and made self-evaluations. Then, the party branches organized party small group life meetings for mutual evaluations within the party. To avoid the phenomenon of everyone saying "you're good, I'm good, everyone is good" during mutual evaluations, various grassroots party organizations adopted many practical and effective methods. Some used face-to-face evaluations, others used back-to-back evaluations, and some even used anonymous voting, filling out evaluation forms separately.

The performance of party members is well-known to the masses. Some counties set up public evaluation boxes throughout the county to attract as many people as possible to participate in the evaluations.

After the evaluations, the region identified 2,472 advanced branches, 6,327 first-class branches, 2,778 second-class branches, and 247 third-class branches. It also identified 50,590 outstanding party members, 303,646 qualified party members, 6,041 basically unqualified party members, and 931 unqualified party members. This not only re-educated party organizations and party members at all levels on party nature, party member standards, and party consciousness but also gave outstanding party members a sense of honor, average party members a sense of pressure, backward party members a sense of crisis, and all party members a sense of responsibility.

During the "Upgrade and Excellence" activity, through self-evaluation, mutual evaluation, party evaluation, and public evaluation, party members, cadres, and the masses communicated their thoughts, exchanged feelings, resolved grievances, and eliminated misunderstandings. In Dingxing County's Xiaobei Village, Deputy Secretary Wang Zhenshui thought that village cadres, who deal with family planning, procurement, levies, fundraising, and land clearance, would certainly not fare well in public evaluations. However, during the evaluation, everyone voted him as outstanding, which made him deeply moved. He felt that party members and the masses could correctly understand and treat village cadres and vowed to work harder in the future, do more practical things, and thank party members and the masses for their encouragement and trust.

In Lixian County's Chengguan Town, 10 party members were evaluated as basically unqualified for violating family planning policies and received yellow card warnings. They were also required to undergo sterilization surgery within 10 days. As a result, these party members completed the surgery in just 3 days. In Dongdan Village, a party member who seized land was evaluated as unqualified. The branch persuaded him to withdraw from the party, and he cried bitterly, immediately giving up the seized land and begging the branch for a chance to correct himself. The branch decided not to expel him immediately.

Based on the "Upgrade and Excellence" activity, some county committees launched "two-way evaluations," exposing many dark sides. The Fuping County Committee started from the county-level agencies, establishing a series of regulations for clean governance. It confiscated 2 illegally purchased cars and fined the units for 20 cars with incomplete procedures. It revoked the business licenses of 38 administrative companies. The county committee started with itself, cracking down on the trend of extravagant banquets, reducing reception fees by more than 10,000 yuan from January to April this year.

For unqualified party members, especially those involved in party corruption, the Baoding Regional Committee firmly clears them out or deals with them, showing no leniency. Wei Ximeng, the director of the Judicial Notary Office in Lixian County, took advantage of business loans to lend money at low interest rates and earn profits from the interest differential. In March 1987, he obtained 200 million yuan in loans through various connections, earning an interest differential of 13,240 yuan, which constituted the crime of speculation. He was expelled from the party.

　　民主评议　纵横监督    
    ——保定地区“支部升级党员争优”活动纪实
    河北省保定地区曾流传着一句顺口溜：“党的活动一阵风，刮过以后无影踪”。如何从根本上改变这种状况，使“党的活动”规范化、系统化、制度化？前不久，保定地委认真总结近年来党的建设实践，在全区开展了“支部升级党员争优”活动。实行民主纵横监督，年终总评，表现好的评为先进或优秀，对党纪不严的，党风不正的，该调的调，该撤的撤，该处理的处理。
    此项活动中，全区每个党员认真回顾近年来的思想、工作、作风等方面的情况，做出自我鉴定。然后由党支部组织召开党小组生活会，进行党内互评。为了避免党员互评中出现你好、我好、大家都好的现象，各基层党组织采取许多切实可行的有效方法，既有面对面评议，又有背靠背评议，有的还采取无记名投票方式，分别填写评议票。
    党员表现如何，群众心里有一本公正帐。一些县为了尽可能多的吸引群众参加评议，在全县普遍设立了群众评议箱。
    经过评议，全区共评出先进支部２４７２个，一类支部６３２７个，二类支部２７７８个，三类支部２４７个；共评出优秀党员５０５９０名，合格党员３０３６４６名，基本不合格党员６０４１名，不合格党员９３１名。不仅使各级党组织和广大党员受到了一次党性、党员标准和党的观念的再教育，并且使先进党员有了荣誉感，中间党员有了压力感，后进党员有了危机感，所有党员都有了责任感。
    “升级争优”活动中，通过自评、互评、党内评和群众评，广大党员、干部和群众沟通了思想，交流了感情，解开了疙瘩，消除了隔阂。定兴县小北头村副支书王振水评议前认为，村干部整天搞计划生育、征购、提留、集资、清理宅基地，这些都是得罪人的事，让群众评议肯定好不了。但在评议中，大家都投了他的优秀票，使他感叹不已，感到党员和群众是能够正确理解和对待村干部的，表示今后要加倍努力工作，多办实事，感谢党员、群众的鼓励和信赖。
    蠡县城关镇有１０名党员因违反计划生育政策，被评为基本不合格党员，受到黄牌警告，并限定在１０天内作节育手术，结果这些党员３天就全部做了手术。东丹村一名党员抢占宅基地被评为不合格党员后，支部劝其退党，他痛哭流涕，当即退出抢占的宅基地，恳求支部给他改正的机会。对此，支部作出暂不除名的决定。
    在“升级争优”活动基础上，一些县委开展了“双向评议”，使不少阴暗面得到曝光。阜平县委经过双向评议，从县直机关抓起，建立了清廉施政的一系列规章制度。先后没收了违章购买的小汽车２辆，对手续不全的２０辆小汽车给予单位罚款。吊销了３８个行政性公司的营业执照。县委从自身做起，狠刹吃喝风，今年１至４月，减少招待费１万多元。
    对不合格党员，特别是党内腐败分子，保定地委坚决清除或处置，决不姑息。蠡县司法公证处主任魏喜孟，趁工商业户贷款之机，低息贷入高息放出，从中牟利。１９８７年３月，他通过各种关系，贷款２００万元，从中得息差款１３２４０元，构成了投机倒把罪，被开除党籍。
