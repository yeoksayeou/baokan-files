The Nepal-India dispute, which arose due to the expiration of trade and transit treaties and India's unilateral suspension of essential supplies and closure of 13 out of 15 border crossing points, preventing third-country goods from entering Nepal, has now lasted three months. During this period, the Nepalese government has repeatedly expressed its willingness to resolve the issue through negotiations. In late March, Nepal's foreign minister flew to New Delhi, requesting that the old trade and transit treaties remain in effect until new ones are signed, but this was rejected by the Indian government. In April, King Birendra stated that Nepal is "ready to resolve the issues between the two countries through friendly negotiations at any time," but this did not receive a positive response from India. In late May, the Nepalese government proposed holding foreign minister-level talks in the first week of June, but as June comes to an end, New Delhi has shown no signs of movement.

Three months of border blockade have brought various difficulties to Nepal, a landlocked and already impoverished country.

The severe shortage of daily necessities has repeatedly triggered panic buying and social unrest, with citizens and students taking to the streets to protest, a rare occurrence in Nepal's history;

Coal and petroleum product reserves have been depleted, and other industrial raw materials are in short supply, severely impacting Nepal's industrial production. Direct economic losses over the past three months have reached tens of millions of dollars, with the economy showing negative growth. The originally planned economic growth rate for this fiscal year (ending July 15) was 5%, but it now seems likely to drop to zero;

Tourism, a major source of foreign exchange for Nepal, has been severely affected. The government had planned to earn $100 million from tourism this year, but due to difficulties in entry, the number of foreign tourists has significantly decreased, making it difficult to achieve the earnings target;

On the Indian side of the Nepal-India border, goods destined for Nepal are piled up like mountains. With the rainy season approaching, these goods face the risk of damage.

India has not benefited from this dispute either, suffering losses in both political and economic terms. Due to the blockade of Nepal, India has been criticized by many countries around the world, and some South Asian countries have expressed concern over India's actions. India's trade with Nepal has declined, affecting the transportation and related service industries that rely on the transit of goods to Nepal.

Historically, India and Nepal have been friendly neighbors. Three years after India's independence, in 1950, the two countries signed a peace and friendship treaty as well as a trade and commerce treaty, and their political and economic exchanges have been close. In 1980, the two countries became members of the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC). In recent years, political and economic cooperation among South Asian countries has been developing, and the current dispute between Nepal and India is clearly inconsistent with the spirit of South Asian cooperation. People around the world, especially those in South Asian countries, hope that Nepal and India can resolve their issues through friendly negotiations.

　　尼印纠葛何时了
    本报记者  任毓骏
    尼泊尔和印度两国由于在贸易条约和过境条约期满后，印度单方面停止供应必需品并关闭了尼印边境１５个过境点中的１３个，不准第三国物资进入尼泊尔，而引起的矛盾，至今已整３个月了。这期间，尼泊尔政府多次表示希望通过谈判解决问题。３月下旬，尼泊尔外交大臣飞赴新德里，要求早先的贸易和过境条约继续有效，直到签署新的条约，但遭到印度政府的拒绝。４月，比兰德拉国王表示，尼泊尔“随时准备通过友好谈判解决两国间的问题”，但未获得印度方面的积极反应。５月下旬，尼泊尔政府又建议，希望在６月份的第一周举行两国外交部长级会谈，眼看６月将尽，新德里方面仍无动于衷。
    ３个月的边境封锁，给尼泊尔这个本来就贫穷落后的内陆山国带来了种种困难。
    生活必需品的严重紧缺，多次引起抢购风潮并触发了社会动乱，市民、学生上街游行，呼喊反政府口号，这在尼泊尔的历史上是少有的；
    煤和石油制品库存告罄，其他工业原料供应无源，尼泊尔的工业生产大受影响，３个月来的直接经济损失高达数千万美元，经济出现负增长，原计划本财政年度（７月１５日结束）的经济增长率为５％，目前看来可能下降到零；
    作为尼泊尔的外汇主要来源的旅游业大受影响。政府原计划今年旅游创汇１亿美元，由于入境困难，外国游客大为减少，创汇计划将难以完成；
    在尼印边境入境口印度一侧，待运往尼泊尔的物资堆集如山，雨季即将来临，这些物资将面临损失。
    印度方面也没有从这场纠纷中得到什么好处，不论在政治上还是经济上均有所失，由于对尼泊尔实行封锁，已经遭到世界上许多国家的舆论谴责，特别是南亚一些国家已经对印度的所作所为表示担忧。印度对尼泊尔的外贸下降，使依靠转运尼泊尔物资的运输业和相应的服务业也难以为继。
    在历史上，印度和尼泊尔一直是友好邻国。印度独立后的第三年，即１９５０年，两国就签订了和平友好条约及贸易和商务条约，两国的政治、经济交往相当密切。１９８０年，两国同时成为南亚区域合作联盟的成员国，特别是近年来，南亚各国政治、经济合作都在发展中，尼印两国目前出现的纠葛显然与南亚合作的气氛很不协调。全世界人民，特别是南亚各国人民希望，尼印两国能通过友好谈判解决两国间的问题。
