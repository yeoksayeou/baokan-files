The Alumni Association of Whampoa Military Academy, while studying the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, expressed its firm support for the communiqué and the various resolutions of the plenary session.

Under the leadership of Chairman Hou Jianru and Vice Chairman Zheng Dongguo, the Alumni Association recently held an expanded meeting of the chairpersons. The meeting expressed its determination to further unite the broad masses of Whampoa alumni, to seriously study the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session, and to seriously study the important speeches of Comrade Deng Xiaoping. They pledged to fulfill their duties at their respective posts, to implement the various tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session, to stabilize the political situation of unity and stability, and to contribute to the peaceful unification of the motherland.

The attendees pointed out that the Fourth Plenary Session and the important speeches of Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly stated that the line, principles, and policies established by the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee will not change, and that the basic line of one central task and two fundamental points will not change. The policy of peaceful reunification and one country, two systems for resolving the Taiwan issue, established after the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, will also not change. The policy of the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government towards Taiwan is in line with the fundamental interests of the people on both sides of the strait and is increasingly understood and supported by the people of Taiwan. They expressed their belief that the broad masses of the people of Taiwan and the Whampoa alumni in Taiwan are patriotic and advocate for the unification of the motherland and the revitalization of the nation. In this counter-revolutionary rebellion, the few people in Taiwan who insist on creating two Chinas will certainly face the resolute opposition of the broad masses of the people of Taiwan and the Whampoa alumni in Taiwan. The Alumni Association of Whampoa Military Academy will, as always, follow the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the academy, and on the basis of the patriotic spirit of Whampoa, further strengthen the connection with Whampoa alumni in Taiwan and overseas, and strive together for the early realization of the peaceful unification of the motherland.

　　黄埔军校同学会讨论四中全会公报时表示    
    为祖国和平统一做贡献
    据新华社北京６月２８日电  黄埔军校同学会在学习中共十三届四中全会公报时表示，坚决拥护四中全会公报和全会的各项决议。
    黄埔同学会在会长侯镜如、副会长郑洞国主持下，近日召开会长扩大会议。会议表示一定要进一步团结广大黄埔同学，认真学习四中全会文件，认真学习邓小平同志的重要讲话，在各自的岗位上，为落实四中全会提出的各项任务，为稳定安定团结的政治局面，为祖国的和平统一做出自己应有的贡献。
    与会同志指出，四中全会和邓小平同志的重要讲话都明确宣布：十一届三中全会制定的路线、方针、政策不会改变，一个中心，两个基本点的基本路线不会改变。十一届三中全会后制定的和平统一、一国两制的解决台湾问题的方针也不会改变。中国共产党和中国政府对台湾的政策，符合两岸人民的根本利益，越来越得到台湾人民的理解和支持。他们表示深信：广大台湾人民和在台黄埔同学都是爱国的，是主张祖国统一和民族振兴的。在这次反革命暴乱中，台湾极少数坚持搞两个中国的人，必将遭到广大台湾人民和在台黄埔同学的坚决反对。我们黄埔同学会将一如既往，遵循校总理孙中山先生的遗教，在黄埔爱国主义精神的基础上，进一步加强与在台及旅居海外黄埔同学的联系，为早日实现祖国的和平统一，共同努力。
