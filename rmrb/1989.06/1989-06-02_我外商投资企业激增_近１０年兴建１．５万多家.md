Xinhua News Agency, Dalian, June 2nd.

China's foreign-invested enterprises have seen a significant increase over the past decade, with more than 15,000 new enterprises established.

According to the vice-chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, Ji Zhōngwēi, in a recent meeting in Dalian, over the past 10 years, China has established more than 15,000 foreign-invested enterprises.

Before 1978, China had only 20 foreign-invested enterprises. By the end of 1988, the cumulative number of approved foreign-invested enterprises nationwide had reached 15,948, including 594 wholly foreign-owned enterprises. These enterprises have a total agreed foreign capital of $28.16 billion, with $12.1 billion actually absorbed.

It is reported that in recent years, the sources of foreign investment in China have become increasingly diverse, expanding to more than 40 countries and regions. In particular, over the past two years, investments from the United States and Japan have surged, accounting for more than 30% of the total agreed foreign capital in the country. Investments from Taiwanese businesses in mainland China have also increased significantly, with the agreed capital amounting to $600 million last year. A survey by the Bank of China in 1988 on 1,607 foreign-invested enterprises in coastal regions showed that 41.3% of the enterprises had good economic benefits and a surplus in foreign exchange receipts and payments, while only 8.9% had foreign exchange imbalances.

Following last year's record-high absorption of foreign investment, China's efforts to attract foreign investment this year continue to be strong. The total agreed investment from January to April has already reached $4.5 billion, an increase of 44% compared to the same period last year.

　　我外商投资企业激增
    近１０年兴建１．５万多家
    据新华社大连６月２日电（记者李小林）中国外商投资企业协会副会长季崇威新近在大连一次会议上透露，近１０年中我国兴建的外商投资企业已超过１．５万家。
    １９７８年前，我国有外商投资企业２０家，截至１９８８年底，全国累计批准的外商投资企业已有１５９４８家，其中独资企业５９４家。这些企业共协议外资金额２８１．６亿美元，实际吸收的外资达１２１亿美元。
    据介绍，近些年来，我国吸收外资的来源日趋广泛，目前，已扩展到４０多个国家和地区。特别是近两年来，美国、日本两国投资激增，投资额已占全国协议外资金额的３０％以上；台湾厂商来大陆投资的也明显增加，去年协议资金额已达６亿美元。中国银行１９８８年对沿海地区１６０７家外商投资企业调查结果表明，经济效益好、外汇收支平衡有余的企业占４１．３％；外汇不平衡的仅占８．９％。
    继去年吸收外资创历史最高水平之后，今年我国引进外资的势头仍然很好。１至４月协议投资总额就已达４５亿美元，比去年同期增加４４％。
