To suppress student movements and various anti-government protests, South Korea's Security Department has decided to use portable liquid gas sprayers.

The Security Department has decided to import 230 portable liquid gas sprayers from Israel. These will first be equipped to the Seoul police, and a two to three month "suppression test" will be conducted. This new type of liquid gas sprayer has a range of 15 meters. South Korea claims that this is an "effective" piece of equipment for suppressing democratic activists, student movements, labor movements, and other anti-government activities. A student representative emphasized that no matter what suppression measures the authorities take, they cannot reduce the public's dissatisfaction with the authorities.

    南朝鲜进口瓦斯喷射器
    本报平壤６月２日电  记者徐宝康报道：汉城消息，为镇压学生运动和各种反政府游行示威，南朝鲜治安本部决定使用便携式液化瓦斯喷射器。
    治安本部决定从以色列进口２３０台便携式液化瓦斯喷射器，首先装备汉城警察，并进行二三个月的“镇压试验”。这种新式液化瓦斯喷射器的射程为１５米。南朝鲜声称，这是一种镇压民主人士、学运、工运等反政府活动的“有效”装备。一位学生代表强调说，无论当局采取任何镇压措施，也无法减轻民众对当局的不满。
