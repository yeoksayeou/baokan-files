The Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing from June 23 to 24, 1989. The session was attended by 170 members of the Central Committee and 106 alternate members. Also in attendance were 184 members of the Central Advisory Commission, 68 members of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection, and 29 other relevant officials.

Prior to the plenary session, the Central Political Bureau held an expanded meeting from June 19 to 21 to make necessary preparations for the Fourth Plenary Session.

The plenary session analyzed the political situation over the past two months and pointed out that a small number of people took advantage of student unrest to instigate a planned, organized, and premeditated political turmoil in Beijing and some other places, which eventually developed into a counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing. Their goal was to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subvert the socialist People's Republic of China. The decisions and major measures taken by the Party Central Committee in this serious political struggle were necessary and correct, and they received the support of the entire Party and the people of the nation. The plenary session highly praised the significant role played by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, represented by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, in this struggle, and highly praised the great contributions made by the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the public security officers in quelling the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital.

The plenary session reviewed and adopted the report submitted by Comrade Li Peng on behalf of the Central Political Bureau, titled "On the Errors Committed by Comrade Zhao Ziyang in the Anti-Party, Anti-Socialist Turmoil." The session concluded that Comrade Zhao Ziyang committed errors in supporting the turmoil and splitting the Party at a crucial moment that concerned the life and death of the Party and the state, and he bore unshirkable responsibility for the formation and development of the turmoil. The nature of his errors and the consequences they caused were extremely serious. During his tenure as a key leader of the Party and the state, although he did some beneficial work in reform and opening up and economic affairs, he also made obvious mistakes in his guiding ideology and practical work. In particular, he neglected the policy of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, seriously neglected Party building, spiritual civilization construction, and ideological and political work, causing serious damage to the Party's cause. In view of the above serious errors, the plenary session decided to remove him from his positions as General Secretary of the Central Committee, Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau, Member of the Political Bureau, Member of the Central Committee, and First Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and to continue the investigation into his problems.

The plenary session made necessary adjustments to some members of the central leadership: Comrade Jiang Zemin was elected as the General Secretary of the Central Committee; Comrades Jiang Zemin, Song Ping, and Li Ruihuan were added as members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau; Comrades Li Ruihuan and Ding Guanggen were appointed as Secretaries of the Secretariat; Comrade Hu Qili was relieved of his positions as Member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau, Member of the Political Bureau, and Secretary of the Secretariat; Comrades Rui Xingwen and Yan Mingfu were relieved of their positions as Secretaries of the Secretariat.

The plenary session highly praised Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech at the reception of senior military officers of the capital's martial law troops, unanimously agreeing that this speech is a programmatic document for us to review the past, think about the future, and unify the Party's ideological understanding. The plenary session emphasized the need to continue to resolutely implement the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and to continue to resolutely implement the basic line of "one center, two basic points" determined by the Thirteenth Party Congress. The Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the state and must be upheld without wavering and consistently; reform and opening up is the path to prosperity and must be firmly and consistently implemented, never returning to the old path of closing the country. At present, special attention should be paid to four major tasks: first, to thoroughly stop the turmoil and quell the counter-revolutionary riot, strictly distinguish between the two types of different contradictions, and further stabilize the national situation; second, to continue to improve governance and rectification, better adhere to reform and opening up, and promote the sustained, stable, and coordinated development of the economy; third, to earnestly strengthen ideological and political work, vigorously promote patriotism, socialism, independence, self-reliance, and hard work education, and resolutely oppose bourgeois liberalization; fourth, to strengthen Party building, strengthen democratic and legal construction, resolutely punish corruption, and earnestly do a few things that the people care about, and not disappoint the people's expectations for the Party.

This plenary session is a very important meeting in the history of our Party's development. It not only has a significant impact on further stabilizing the national situation at present but will also have a far-reaching influence on ensuring the continuity of the Party's line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee in the future.

The plenary session reiterated that China will continue to adhere to an independent foreign policy of peace, continue to develop friendly relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and continue to contribute to the maintenance of world peace. The plenary session believes that China's just struggle to quell the counter-revolutionary riot will be understood by the people of the world, and the friendly relations between the Chinese people and the people of the world will continue to develop.

The plenary session called on the entire Party and the people of all ethnic groups across the country to unite more closely around the Party Central Committee, work together, strive hard, overcome all difficulties on the way forward, and confidently continue to advance the cause of socialist modernization and reform and opening up in China!

    新华社北京６月２４日电　中国共产党第十三届中央委员会第四次全体会议公报
    （１９８９年６月２４日通过）
    中国共产党第十三届中央委员会第四次全体会议，１９８９年６月２３日至２４日在北京召开。出席这次全会的中央委员１７０人，候补中央委员１０６人。列席会议的中央顾问委员会委员１８４人，中央纪律检查委员会委员６８人，有关方面负责同志２９人。
    全会之前，中央政治局于６月１９日至２１日举行了扩大会议，为四中全会的召开作了必要的准备。
    全会分析了近两个月来全国的政治形势，指出极少数人利用学潮，在北京和一些地方掀起一场有计划、有组织、有预谋的政治动乱，进而在北京发展成了反革命暴乱。他们策动动乱和暴乱的目的，就是要推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义的中华人民共和国。在这场严肃的政治斗争中，党中央的决策和采取的一系列重大措施，都是必要的和正确的，得到了全党全国人民的拥护。全会高度评价以邓小平同志为代表的老一辈无产阶级革命家在这场斗争中发挥的重大作用，高度评价在平息首都反革命暴乱中中国人民解放军、武警部队和公安干警作出的巨大贡献。
    全会审议并通过了李鹏同志代表中央政治局提出的《关于赵紫阳同志在反党反社会主义的动乱中所犯错误的报告》。会议认为，赵紫阳同志在关系党和国家生死存亡的关键时刻犯了支持动乱和分裂党的错误，对动乱的形成和发展负有不可推卸的责任，其错误的性质和造成的后果是极为严重的。他在担任党和国家重要领导职务期间，虽然在改革开放和经济工作方面做了一些有益的工作，但是在指导思想上和实际工作中也有明显失误。特别是他主持中央工作以来，消极对待坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的方针，严重忽视党的建设、精神文明建设和思想政治工作，给党的事业造成了严重的损失。鉴于赵紫阳同志的上述严重错误，全会决定，撤销他的中央委员会总书记、中央政治局常务委员会委员、中央政治局委员、中央委员会委员和中共中央军事委员会第一副主席的职务，对他的问题继续进行审查。
    全会对中央领导机构的部分成员进行了必要的调整：选举江泽民同志为中央委员会总书记；增选江泽民、宋平、李瑞环同志为中央政治局常务委员会委员；决定增补李瑞环、丁关根同志为中央书记处书记；免去胡启立同志中央政治局常务委员会委员、中央政治局委员、中央书记处书记的职务，免去芮杏文、阎明复同志中央书记处书记的职务。
    全会高度评价邓小平同志接见首都戒严部队军以上干部的重要讲话，一致认为，这个讲话是我们回顾过去，思考未来，统一全党思想认识的纲领性文件。全会强调，要继续坚决执行党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针和政策，继续坚决执行党的十三大确定的“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线。四项基本原则是立国之本，必须毫不动摇、始终一贯地加以坚持；改革开放是强国之路，必须坚定不移、一如既往地贯彻执行，绝不回到闭关锁国的老路上去。当前，要特别注意抓好四件大事：一是彻底制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，进一步稳定全国局势；二是继续搞好治理整顿，更好地坚持改革开放，促进经济持续、稳定、协调地发展；三是认真加强思想政治工作，努力开展爱国主义、社会主义、独立自主、艰苦奋斗的教育，切实反对资产阶级自由化；四是大力加强党的建设，大力加强民主和法制建设，坚决惩治腐败，切实做好几件人民普遍关心的事情，决不辜负人民对党的期望。
    这次全会在我们党的历史发展上是一次非常重要的会议。它不仅对于当前进一步稳定全国局势具有重大作用，而且对于今后保证十一届三中全会以来党的路线、方针、政策的连续性，必将产生深远的影响。
    全会重申，我国坚持独立自主的和平外交政策不变，我国将在和平共处五项原则的基础上继续同世界各国发展友好关系，对维护世界和平继续作出贡献。全会相信，我国平息反革命暴乱的正义斗争必将得到世界各国人民的理解，我国人民和世界各国人民的友好关系必将得到继续发展。
    全会号召：全党、全国各族人民更加紧密地团结在党中央周围，同心同德，艰苦奋斗，克服前进道路上的一切困难，满怀信心地把我国社会主义现代化建设和改革开放事业继续推向前进！（附图片）
