Recently, the Youth Committee of the Chinese Historical Society invited some young and middle-aged historians in Beijing to hold a discussion meeting. The participants focused on the central theme of "Reform and Historical Science," discussing how historiography can reform to meet the challenges of the times and how it can better serve the country in the process of reform.

Evaluation of the Current State of Historiography

The participants acknowledged the achievements of historiographical reform in recent years. This is mainly reflected in the fact that, under the influence of the increasingly strong trend of social reform and the integration of science, more people in the field of historiography have gained a clear understanding of the need to transform historiography. They feel that some traditional historiographical paradigms no longer suit the current need for systematic and comprehensive research and the requirements of social practice. More people are beginning to pay attention to the study of historiographical theory and to learn about and adopt global historiographical information and methods. At the same time, there is a new understanding of the scientific value and social function of history, no longer limited to self-evaluation within a closed disciplinary scope, but reflected through the connection and interaction between historiography and other social factors. With this awareness, the field of historiography has, in recent years, conducted multi-level and multi-angle discussions on the relationship between historiography and reality, historiography and Marxism, and historiography and other disciplines, achieving certain breakthroughs and progress.

However, whether the new thinking of historiographical reform has deeply penetrated the minds of people, and whether historiographical reform has reached an irreversible stage, are still questions worth serious consideration. Traditional values and outdated models still have an unignorable influence. The work of reconstructing and adjusting the discipline of history is still arduous and extensive.

Some representatives believe that although the field of historiography has made many efforts, historiography has not yet found its proper place. Historiography does not necessarily have to become a prominent discipline, but it should not be neglected either. Some recent situations are worth pondering: some important theoretical issues, such as the historical development stages of socialism, are not being discussed by the field of historiography but by economists; many valuable historical experiences, especially those that still have a cautionary effect today, have been avoided or downplayed; in the academic community, some people engaged in related disciplines even question whether historiography is a science. All these indicate that historiography has not yet truly emerged from its predicament.

The Social Function of Historiography

Most participants believe that historiography is not just a collection of historical materials or a compilation of historical records, but a comprehensive product of social ideology and culture, and at the same time, it is the result of subjective activities and choices in a certain political, economic, and cultural context. The basic function of historical science is the function of cognition and deep understanding, that is, to understand the past and, through the connection between the past and the present and even the future, to reveal the laws and trends of human social development, playing a role in providing lessons and understanding the rise and fall of civilizations. However, the function of historiography is manifested through its influence on society, which determines that historiography should intervene in reality and face social needs. Acknowledging that historical research has practical significance is not to expect historiography to be a panacea for solving real-world problems, but rather, through the correct summary of historical experiences, to help people understand and transcend themselves, providing people with methods and paths to understand the world and grasp their own destiny.

Some representatives pointed out that in recent years, some economists, policy research departments, and administrative leaders have proposed reform plans that lack historical perspective and cannot correctly review the past, and thus cannot correctly look forward, resulting in short-term behavior. This also fully illustrates that for historiography to play its proper role, it cannot be separated from the understanding and recognition of the entire society.

Some representatives, recalling the "mirror historiography" of the Cultural Revolution, proposed that historiography should intervene in reality, starting from actual conditions, seeking truth from facts, and following the inherent laws of historical development. Historians must have a conscience and a sense of social responsibility.

The Future of Historiography

The participants felt that the future of historiography lies in the fact that historical science must face reality and society, answering the new questions raised by the reform. Historiography should have a strong sense of the times and mission, with an urgent sense of participation, seriously conducting historical reflection, and seeking the path to the future.

Many representatives pointed out that historiography, whether in theory or method, should transition from tradition to modernity, changing the situation of single research objects, outdated concepts, simple methods, and dull writing. The development of historiography largely depends on breakthroughs in theory and method. Based on learning and absorbing global historiographical theories, a complete and independent scientific theoretical system should be quickly formed; quantitative analysis, psychological analysis, comparative research, structural analysis, as well as cybernetics, systems theory, and information theory should be utilized and borrowed; while emphasizing politics and economics, attention should be paid to research on topics such as society, culture, religion, and folklore; the dynamic and diverse aspects of historical events should be restored, revealing the inner world of historical figures, including their thoughts, psychology, feelings, desires, and humanity, in addition to their political activities and social experiences.

Some representatives believe that from a historical perspective, the focal point of contemporary social contradictions should be found, new horizons should be opened, new ideas should be developed, and new realms should be entered. Research topics closely related to reform and capable of providing decision-making should be studied, such as the issue of intellectuals. Intellectuals are the social carriers of science and culture and the main force of national modernization. The growth path of modern Chinese intellectuals differs greatly from that of other countries and is always in a state of congenital deficiency and acquired imbalance. How to correctly understand and treat intellectuals and implement intellectual policies is a major issue in socialist construction and reform. Researching modern intellectuals can provide a theoretical basis for solving this problem. In addition, not only the history of comedy should be researched, but also the history of tragedy. Even for ugly and unworthy past events, they should be dissected calmly and scientifically. Only through deep reflection can the nation awaken.

Many representatives called for strengthening the study of contemporary history. Without studying contemporary history, it is impossible to examine China's current situation from the overall perspective of social evolution. Therefore, it is necessary to reform the political, economic, and cultural systems that have gradually formed since the founding of the country, which involves important historical issues since the founding of the country. Currently, foreign interest in and publication of works on modern and contemporary Chinese history is high. In contrast, domestic research has progressed slowly. To study contemporary history, both successful experiences and major mistakes (including economic and political-cultural ones) should be rationally reflected upon.

　　史学的改革与出路    
    ——“改革与历史科学”讨论会综述
    前不久，中国史学会青年委员会邀请在京的部分中青年史学工作者，举行讨论会，与会者围绕“改革与历史科学”的中心议题，对历史学如何改革以回答时代的挑战、历史学怎样在改革中更好地发挥功用等问题进行了广泛的探讨。
    　　　　对史学现状的评价
    与会者肯定了这几年史学改革所取得的成就，主要表现在随着社会改革和科学整体化趋势愈益强大的影响，史学界更多的人对历史学的改造有了清醒的认识，感到传统史学的某些范式不再适应于当今进行系统的综合性研究和向社会实践的发展要求，越来越多的人开始重视史学理论的研究，注意了解和学习世界的史学信息和史学方法。同时，对于历史的科学价值和社会功能有了新的认识，不再局限于封闭的学科范围内进行自我评价，而是通过史学与其它社会因素的联系和相互作用中反映出来。带着这种感知，史学界近年围绕着历史学与现实、历史学与马克思主义、历史学与其它学科的关系进行了多层次、多视角的讨论，并取得一定的突破和进展。
    但是，历史学改革的新思维是否深入人心，历史学改革是否已达到不可逆转的程度，还是值得人们认真思考的。传统的价值观、陈旧的模式还有着不可忽视的影响。历史学科本身的改造与调整工作还是艰巨的大量的。
    有的代表认为，虽然史学界作了不少努力，但史学仍没有走到恰当的位置上。史学未必要成为显学，但也不应被冷落。近年有些情况颇值得深思：一些重要的理论问题，诸如社会主义的历史发展阶段，不是史学界在作论证，而是经济学界；很多宝贵的历史经验，尤其是一些至今仍有警醒作用的历史经验被回避或作淡化处理了；在学术界，有些从事相近学科研究的人甚至对历史学是一门科学竟然也提出了非议。如此种种都说明，史学并未真正走出困境。
    　　　　史学的社会功能
    多数与会者认为，历史学不是脱离社会环境的史料的剪裁或堆砌的集合，而是一种社会的意识形态和社会文化的综合产物，同时又是在一定的政治、经济、文化背景下的主体活动、主体选择的结果。历史科学的基本功能就是认识和深刻理解的功能，即了解过去，通过过去与现实乃至未来的联系中，揭示人类社会发展规律及趋向，起“资鉴”和知兴衰的作用。但史学的功能是作用于社会而表现出来的，这就决定了史学应该干预现实，面向社会需要。承认历史研究有现实意义，不是期望史学成为解决现实问题的灵丹妙药，而是在正确地总结历史经验中，帮助人们对自身的认识和超越，给人们以认识世界、把握自我命运的方法和途径。
    有的代表指出，近些年一些经济学家、政策研究部门和行政领导提出改革的规划时，有的缺乏历史感，不能正确地回顾过去，当然不能正确地向前看，结果导致了短期行为。这也充分说明史学要发挥其恰当的功用，离不开全社会的理解与认同。
    也有的代表对文革的“影射史学”记忆犹新，提出史学要干预现实，必须从实际出发，实事求是，遵循历史发展自身的规律。史学家必须要有良知和社会责任感。
    　　　　史学的出路
    与会者感到，史学的出路在于历史科学必须面对现实、面向社会，回答改革中提出的新问题。历史学应有强烈的时代感与使命感，要有迫切的参与意识，认真地进行历史反思，寻求走向未来之路。
    很多代表指出，史学无论是理论还是方法都要从传统走向现代，变革史学研究对象单一、概念陈旧、方法简单、文风枯燥的状况。史学的发展，在很大程度上倚重于理论和方法的突破。要在学习和吸收世界史学理论的基础上，尽快形成一个完整独立的科学理论体系；利用和借鉴数量分析法、心理分析法、比较研究法、结构分析法以及控制论、系统论和信息论等方法；在强调政治、经济的同时，注意社会、文化、宗教和民俗等课题研究；恢复历史事件的生动性、多样性面貌，揭示历史人物除政治活动、社会经历以外的包括思想、心理、感觉、欲望、人性等的内部世界。
    有的代表认为，要从历史角度找出现实社会矛盾的透视点，开拓新视野，发展新观念，进入新境界，研究与改革密切相关的、能够为改革提供决策的选题，如知识分子问题。知识分子是科技文化的社会载体，是国家现代化的生力军。中国近代知识分子成长道路与其他国家有很大差别，又总是处于先天不足、后天失调的境况中，如何正确认识和对待知识分子，正确实行知识分子政策，已成为社会主义建设和改革中的一个重大问题。研究近代史上的知识分子则能为这个问题的解决提供理论依据。此外，不仅要研究喜剧历史，还要研究悲剧历史，对哪怕是丑陋的，不堪回首的往事也能冷静地、科学地解剖，只有深刻地反省才能使民族觉醒。
    不少代表呼吁加强当代史研究，不研究当代史、就不能从社会演进的总体角度考察中国何以走到非进行改革就不能前进的地步。因此需要对建国以来逐步形成的政治、经济、文化体制进行改革，就要触及建国以来的重要历史问题。现在国外对中国现代史和当代史的研究兴趣极大，也出版了不少论著。相比之下，国内的研究却进展缓慢。要研究当代史，既要研究成功的经验，又不能回避对重大失误（包括经济的和政治文化的）的理性思维。
