Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 24th.

The question of whether burning the American flag is illegal has become a point of contention between the U.S. Supreme Court and Congress and the White House in the past few days.

The issue arose from a Supreme Court ruling on a case. In 1984, during the Republican National Convention in Dallas, a protester named Gregory Johnson burned an American flag in front of City Hall. Under Texas state law, which prohibits desecration of the flag, he was sentenced to one year in prison and fined $2,000. However, in 1988, the Texas Court of Criminal Appeals overturned the conviction on the basis of another constitutional provision, and the case was appealed to the Supreme Court.

On June 21, the nine justices of the U.S. Supreme Court ruled by a narrow 5-4 margin to overturn the conviction. The five justices, led by Brennan, stated that the expression of personal opinions is protected by the First Amendment to the Constitution. Since Johnson burned the flag to express his views, he should not be punished. However, if burning the flag incites a riot, it may be prosecuted for violating the law.

The Supreme Court's ruling has had a significant impact on the United States. Except for Alaska and Wyoming, all 48 states have laws prohibiting desecration of the flag, and the federal government also has a similar law. The ruling immediately drew criticism from the White House and Congress.

On June 22, while visiting New York, President Bush said at a rally that he respects the Supreme Court and hopes to see the country's laws fully supported, but he added, "I must express my personal reaction: the act of burning the flag is wrong, absolutely wrong."

On Capitol Hill, Democratic and Republican representatives alike criticized the court. Newly elected House Speaker Wright said that Americans abhor the act of burning the flag and find it hard to understand how such an act can be forgiven. Senators were equally emotional. On June 22, the Senate passed a resolution by an overwhelming 97-3 vote expressing "deep disappointment" with the Supreme Court's ruling. The resolution called for an immediate study of the impact of the Supreme Court's ruling and efforts to restore penalties for flag desecration. The resolution declared that Congress believes that desecrating the flag is not protected by the First Amendment. Many representatives called for a constitutional amendment to overturn the court's ruling, but it is said that such an amendment requires the support of two-thirds of the representatives and 38 state legislatures, a cumbersome process. Therefore, the Senate also passed a bill on June 23 to punish flag desecration. The bill states that anyone who tears, damages, burns, tramples on the American flag, or places it on the ground will be fined up to $1,000, or sentenced to up to one year in prison, or both.

### 美高法裁定焚毁国旗不违法  白宫国会指责高法裁决错误

　　美高法裁定焚毁国旗不违法  白宫国会指责高法裁决错误
    本报华盛顿６月２４日电  在美国烧毁国旗是否犯法？这在近两天成为美国最高法院与国会和白宫之间争论的问题。
    事情是由最高法院对一桩案件的裁决引起的。１９８４年，共和党全国代表大会在达拉斯举行期间，一个名叫格雷戈里·约翰逊的示威者在市政厅前面烧毁了一面美国国旗。根据得克萨斯州的禁止污辱国旗法，此人被判处一年徒刑、罚款２０００美元。但去年，得克萨斯州的刑事上诉院以宪法的另外有关条款为依据推翻了上述判决，案件一直上诉到最高法院。
    美国最高法院的９名最高法官于今年６月２１日以５∶４的微弱多数赞成推翻判决。以布伦南为代表的５名最高法官称，表达个人意见的行为受到宪法第一修正案的保护，因约翰逊表示己见烧毁国旗不能受到惩罚，但如以烧毁国旗煽动骚乱，则有可能因触犯法律而被起诉。
    最高法院的裁决对美国的影响极大，因为除阿拉斯加和怀俄明两个州外，全国４８个州都制订有禁止污辱国旗法，联邦也有一项类似的法令。上述裁决立即引起白宫和国会的斥责。
    ６月２２日正在纽约视察的布什总统在一个集会上说，他尊重最高法院，希望看到本国法律得到充分支持，但他说，“我必须表示个人反应，烧毁国旗的行动是错误的，绝对错误的。”
    在国会山上，民主党和共和党的众议员同声指责法院。众议院新上任的议长弗利说，美国人痛恶烧毁国旗的行为，他们很难理解这种行为是可以原谅的。参议员们的情绪同样激烈。２２日，参院以９７票对３票的压倒多数通过一项决议，对最高法院的裁决“深表失望”。决议要求立即研究最高法院裁决的影响，设法恢复对毁旗行为的制裁。决议宣布，国会相信污辱国旗的行为决不是第一修正案所保护的言论自由。许多议员要求作出一项宪法修正案，推翻法院的裁决，但据说，这类修正案需要得到２／３议员票数和３８个州的立法机构的赞成，过程繁琐。因此，参院又于２３日通过一项立法，要求惩罚污辱国旗行为。此项立法称，凡撕毁、毁损、烧毁、践踏美国国旗者或把国旗放在地面上者，都将课以１千美元之内的罚款，或判处一年之内的徒刑，或者同时罚款并判刑。
