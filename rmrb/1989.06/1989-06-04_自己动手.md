	Do It Yourself
	Zhèng Wěi (9 years old) drawing  Ā Tóng poem

	I am the only child in my family
	Every day, Mom washes my feet
	Dad helps me carry my schoolbag
	People see this and shake their heads
	Hmph, what a lazy cat!
	Now I have grown taller and bigger
	How can I let them see me through the door crack?
	I will do my own things myself
	Today, I will start by washing my clothes
	Red skirt, green pants
	And towels, one by one
	The sun sees this and laughs
	The birds hear this and fly over
	Little birds, little birds, help me out
	Quickly report to my parents
	From now on, I am no longer lazy
	I will be a good child who loves to study and work

　　自己动手
    郑伟（９岁）画  阿童　配诗
    我是家里的独苗苗
    每天妈妈给我洗脚丫
    爸爸帮我拎书包
    人们见了都撇撇嘴
    哼，真是一只大懒猫
    如今我长大也长高
    怎能让他们从门缝里把人瞧
    自己的事情我要自己做
    今天就动手洗花袄
    红裙子　绿裤子
    还有毛巾一条条
    太阳见了哈哈笑
    小鸟听说也飞来了
    小鸟小鸟帮个忙
    快向我爸妈作报告
    以后我不再是懒猫
    做一个爱学习爱劳动的好宝宝
