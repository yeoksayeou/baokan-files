Jiangxi Issues Regulations to Curb Banquet Culture

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, May 31st.

Jiangxi Province has recently issued specific regulations to firmly curb the practice of extravagant banquets and has called on the public to monitor compliance.

The regulations stipulate that all public servants in government and party offices must adhere to a three-dish-one-soup meal system when on official business. Expensive dishes, as well as tobacco, alcohol, beverages, and fruits, are strictly prohibited. Dining at restaurants or banquet halls is also forbidden. Local government and enterprise leaders, as well as reception personnel, are not allowed to accompany guests during meals.

For any instance where the public meal system is not followed and banquets are held instead, the banquet expenses will be recovered, and an additional fine equal to the amount spent will be imposed. Leaders of the receiving units will be fined and have their monthly bonuses deducted. Those who violate the regulations three times will face demotion or be publicly reprimanded.
