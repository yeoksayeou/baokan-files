The Martial Law Command Headquarters' News Office reports: At 6:20 PM on June 10, a reporter from the Liaoning Daily delivered a letter of condolence and 90 yuan to the duty room of the Shenyang Military Region Political Department, requesting that the letter and money be forwarded to the martial law troops. The duty officer, Secretary Xu, said, "We can forward the letter, but we cannot accept the money." He was then overcome with emotion and said, "After watching the television broadcast of the truth about the riot, I felt extremely sad and angry. The rioters brutally attacked our soldiers and destroyed military vehicles; this is no different from fascism. 'The State Council has issued a martial law order, why didn't the soldiers defend themselves legally and appropriately, resulting in such heavy losses?' He repeatedly requested that the letter and money be forwarded to the martial law troops.

Below is the letter he wrote. To my respected and beloved martial law troops (including the People's Armed Police) in the capital:

The capital belongs to all citizens of the country. Therefore, please allow me, as an ordinary citizen of the state, to extend my sincere greetings to you—you have been wronged and suffered injustice (writing this, tears well up in my eyes)! I understand and sympathize with you so much. Through the "Truth About the Riot" video, I felt that this time you participated in a battle unprecedented in ancient and modern history, both in China and abroad. Due to the incitement and slander of a small handful of people spreading rumors, a wave of misunderstanding towards you formed among the masses. You have endured so much injustice in this wave. When beer bottles and bricks rained down on you like hail, when you were pushed and couldn't breathe, and at the same time were cursed, what did you think? Perhaps you thought, "We have endured hardships and suffered for the peace of the people for half a month, enduring wind and rain!" But what you got was curses and fists from the masses who did not understand the truth. This situation is truly "enduring beatings and insults for you, but you remain unaware of the insults and beatings." This is so hard to bear for you young, vigorous men! Someone said that injustice is a more painful punishment than death. But in the face of your great and holy souls, a miracle occurred: to avoid hurting the feelings of the people, you endured the personal insults inflicted by the people you were protecting and even giving your lives for ("a small handful" excluded). You shed tears in your hearts and silently endured this immense blow to your souls; you were beaten to the point of near death, and your eyes were beaten out, but you did not fight back. Even more astonishing is that, to avoid hurting the people's hearts, you watched as your dear comrades were burned alive and beaten to death, but you did not open fire. Is it that you lack emotion? No, you possess the most beautiful souls in the world, because you poured all your love into the hearts of the people who did not understand the truth. This is such a cruel spiritual torment! If you did not have a heart that loves the people, it would be impossible to do this. Therefore, I can say, great Chinese soldiers, you have created a miracle for all of humanity in this regard!

After enduring hardships and trials, you finally entered the city. For the people, you paid such a price, and you should be credited! But you, without rest, immediately engaged in the battle to restore the capital's economy. While others live in comfortable rooms and eat delicious food, you live in simple tents, with wounds, fighting day and night. To ensure that the people of Beijing can eat well, you do not brush off the dust, driving trucks to transport grain. You stand by the roads where workers go to work, with your young bodies straight, and your youthful faces filled with sincerity, saluting the citizens of Beijing with standard military salutes! Ah, what open hearts, what a lofty realm! How much love your souls have poured out to the people! Watching this scene on television, I could not bear it, I was moved to tears. Here, please allow me, as an ordinary citizen of the state, to return a deep bow to the dear soldiers!

Since watching the first "Truth About the Riot" television documentary on the evening of June 6, I have not been able to eat or sleep well! How tragic, so many soldiers full of youthful innocence, and young officers, were burned and beaten to death. Some were burned to a crisp, their stomachs cut open, and left in a kneeling position on the street. How can anyone bear to see this, how can it not tear at one's heart? Beloved brothers who have died: you may have been only seventeen or eighteen years old, just starting your journey in life, with so many beautiful things in the world yet to experience, but with a heart full of loyalty to the people, you painfully left us. I, at forty years old, have experienced much more of the beauty of the world than you, and I deeply regret that I could not die in your place! Here, I express my deepest condolences to you. Rest in peace, citizens with conscience will not forget you!

I also have a few words for the parents of the martyrs: Although we are strangers, as a sympathetic stranger, I have been thinking of you. Perhaps you have just received the notice of your child's martyrdom? I think that no language in the world can truly describe your sorrow. Please allow me, from afar, to kneel and pay my respects to you in the traditional manner of the Chinese people, to express my respect and condolences to you. Please accept it, because my heart is sincere, and I hope that this will bring a little comfort to your hearts that have suffered such a heavy blow.

Next, I have a few words for the scum of humanity—the rioters who harmed the soldiers: You inflicted such cruelty on young men who, although armed, did not open fire or even retaliate with words or fists when faced with your insults and beatings. You ignored their cries of pain, and I think even a beast with a bit of humanity would not do such a thing. You shout about democracy, but I do not hide my views, I am in favor of democracy. However, democracy includes human rights, and respecting each person's individuality and promoting humanity are extremely important components of human rights. Cherishing human life is the pinnacle of respecting individuality and promoting humanity. You harm the lives of people who, although armed, do not resist at all, like cutting grass at will. Such people shout about democracy, isn't this a huge joke? You are not "democracy fighters," but precisely the scum of humanity who trample on democracy. For you, engaging in Hitler-style barbarism to trample on democracy is a good fit.

Rioters, if you happen to escape the law, I think, if you are a member of humanity, you will be tormented by your conscience day and night and will not find peace! "Voice of America" announcers, gentlemen and ladies, you have been tirelessly talking about how this group of rioters in China is fighting for democracy, right? Look, these rioters, who lack even the most basic humanity, are not engaged in any democratic movement, but precisely in fascist atrocities that trample on human life. If you continue to sing praises of democracy for this group of people, I think you will not be able to avoid feeling ashamed!

Finally, dear comrades-in-arms, please allow me to donate a small amount of money to you, to express my respect and gratitude. I believe that the price you have paid for the people, both spiritually and physically, is something that billions of yuan cannot replace.

Additionally, my wife and I share the same feelings. She entrusted me to convey the same gratitude and respect to you.

Dear comrades-in-arms, please believe me! Not a single word in this letter is insincere, because this letter comes from my sincere heart, shaken by the miracle you have created, and is written with tears of surging emotions!

With deepest respect,
A citizen of China, a reporter from the Liaoning Daily

### 你们具有世界上最美好的心灵——一位新闻工作者致戒严部队的信

　　你们具有世界上最美好的心灵
    ——一位新闻工作者致戒严部队的信
    戒严部队指挥部新闻处按：６月１０日下午６点２０分，辽宁日报一名记者将一封慰问信和９０元钱送到沈阳军区政治部值班室，恳请将慰问信和钱转给戒严部队。值班的徐秘书说：“信我们可以转去，但钱不能收。”他当时声泪俱下说：“看了暴乱真相的电视报道后，我感到非常痛心和气愤，暴徒那样残害解放军干部战士，毁坏军车，这同法西斯有什么两样？”“国务院已经下了戒严令，军人为什么不依法正当防卫，以至遭受了这么大的损失？”他再三请求：一定要将信和钱转给戒严部队。
    下面是他写的慰问信。我敬仰的至亲至爱的首都戒严部队（包括武警）全体指战员们：
    首都是全国公民的。所以，请允许我以国家普通公民的身份向你们致以诚挚的问候——你们遭冤枉、受委屈了（写到此，我热泪不禁涌出眼眶）！我太理解同情你们啦。通过“暴乱真相”的录像，我体会到你们这次参加的是一次古今中外前所未有的战斗。由于一小撮造谣惑众者的挑拨中伤，在群众中形成了一股对你们误解的洪流。你们在这洪流中受尽了委屈。当啤酒瓶、砖头冰雹似地落到你们头上的时候，当被不明真相的群众挤得喘不过气、同时又遭到辱骂的时候，你们想到了什么？也许想：“我们是为了群众的安宁才这样含辛茹苦，半个月以来的餐风露宿！”可是得到的是不明真相的群众的辱骂和拳头。这种情形真是“挨打受骂献身都为您，您却浑然不晓辱打我”啊！这，对于你们一个个活生生的血气方刚的青年来说，是多么难以忍受啊！有人说，委屈是比死更难受的刑罚。可是在你们一颗颗伟大圣洁的心灵面前，奇迹出现了：为了不伤害群众的情感，你们领受着被你们为之保护甚至献身的人们（“一小撮”除外）对你们施加的人格侮辱。你们把泪流在心里，默默地受着这心灵上的巨大重创；你们自己被打得奄奄一息，生生打瞎双眼也不还手。令人更为感叹的是，为了不伤害群众的心灵，你们宁可眼睁睁地看着自己亲爱的战友被活活烧死，活活打死，也不开枪。是你们缺乏感情吗？不，你们具有着世界上最美好的心灵，因为你们把全身心的爱倾注到了不明真相的群众头上，这是何等残酷的精神折磨啊！如果没有一颗爱人民的心灵，无论如何也是做不到这一点的。因此，我可以说，伟大的中国军人啊，你们在这一点上创造了整个人类的奇迹！
    历尽艰辛，累经磨难，你们终于进城了。为群众付出这样的代价，你们应该居功！可是你们却马不歇鞍、人未释枪地投入了恢复首都经济的战斗。别人住着舒适的房间，吃着可口的饭菜，你们却驻宿简陋的棚屋，带着伤口日以继夜地战斗。为了北京人能吃得好，你们不掸征尘，出车运粮。你们在职工上班的路旁，挺直一个个年轻的身躯，一张张充满稚气的脸上，挂着极度的真诚，向北京市民致以标准的军礼！啊，这是怎样豁达的心胸，这样的境界是多么崇高！你们的心灵向人民倾注了怎样的爱啊！在电视机前看到此情此景的我，真受不了，我激动得哭了。这里，请允许我以国家普通公民的身份，向亲爱的军人还以深深的一礼！
    自从６月６号晚看了第一部“暴乱真相”电视纪录片后，我迄今仍吃不好饭，睡不好觉！好惨啊，那么多浑身上下洋溢着天真气质的士兵，还有青年军官，竟被活活烧死、打死打伤。有的被烧焦后，剖腹以跪姿暴尸街头。这，能不使每个人为之惨不忍睹，撕心裂肺吗？至亲至爱的惨死的小弟弟们：你们也许才十七八岁，在人生的旅途上才刚刚启航，人间的许多美好的事物都还未来得及领受，就怀着一腔爱民的忠贞，痛苦地离开了我们。我，４０岁了，在人生的道路上已经比你们多领略了不少的人间之美，我为自己未能替你们去死而深感遗憾！在此，我向你们表示无比虔诚的哀悼。安息吧，有良心的公民不会忘记你们的！
    我还要向烈士的父母说几句话：我们虽素不相识，但我作为一个有同情心的陌生人，一直挂念着你们，也许你们现在刚刚收到烈士牺牲的通知书吧？我想，用世界上的任何语言也无法切实地描述出你们的哀痛之情。请允许我以中华民族传统的礼节，在遥远的地方对你们进行跪拜，以此表达我对你们的敬意和慰问。请接受吧，因为我的心是诚恳的，但愿我这样做会给你们蒙受重大创伤的心灵带去一点点慰藉。
    下面我要向人类的败类——残害军人的暴徒们说几句话：你们对虽然带着武器，然而在你们的辱骂和痛打面前不但不开枪甚至连口和拳头都不还的青年（因为军人是普通老百姓穿上军装的人）下这样的毒手，你们对他们号痛的声音竟然充耳不闻，置之不理，我看连通点人性的野兽都不会干出这样的事情来。你们不是高喊着民主吗？我不隐瞒观点，我这个人是赞成民主的，但是民主的一个组成内容是人权，而尊重每个人的个性和发扬人道又是人权的极为重要的内容，怜惜人的生命则是尊重人的个性和发扬人道的顶峰内容。你们祸害带着武器却一点都不反抗的人的生命，就像随意割草一样。这样的人竟然高喊着民主，这不是天大的笑话吗？你们并不是“民主斗士”，而恰恰是践踏民主的人类败类。对于你们来说，搞希特勒式的野蛮地践踏民主的法西斯主义倒个个是块好料。
    暴徒们，假如你侥幸逃脱了法网，我想，如果你是人类中的一员的话，你定会受到良心的自我谴责而日夜不得安宁！“美国之音”的播音员先生、女士们，你们不是令人耳不暇接地讲中国这伙暴徒是在搞民主吗？你们看，他们这种连一点起码的人性都不具备的暴徒，搞的并不是什么民主运动，而恰恰是草菅人命的法西斯兽行。如果你们还对这伙人高唱民主赞歌的话，我想，你们不会不感到脸红的！
    最后，亲爱的指战员同志们，请允许我向你们捐献很少一点人民币，以此表达我对你们的敬意和谢意。我认为，你们为群众所付出的心灵上和肉体上的代价，是用几亿人民币也无法替代的。
    另外，我的妻子和我也有同感，她委托我向你们致以同样的谢意和敬意。
    亲爱的指战员同志们，请相信我吧！这里没有一个字的虚情假意，因为这封信是发自我真诚的、被你们所创造的奇迹所震颤着的心灵，是用激荡澎湃着的情感所化成的泪水写成的！
