The seven major rivers of the Yellow River, Huai River, Hai River, Yangtze River, Pearl River, Liao River, and Songhua River, along with hundreds of coastal rivers, pose a flood threat to an area of 738,000 square kilometers. This region encompasses one-third of the nation's arable land, two-fifths of its population, and three-fifths of its total industrial and agricultural output. The railway network extends approximately 11,000 kilometers. If these rivers' levees were to breach, the consequences would be dire.

Since the founding of the People's Republic, China has undertaken extensive river management projects, repairing and constructing 148,000 kilometers of levees; building over 60,000 reservoirs with a total capacity of 340 billion cubic meters; constructing 15,000 water gates; and creating new outlets for the Hai River and Huai River to discharge into the sea. Additionally, flood detention areas and lakes have been improved, significantly enhancing the flood control capabilities of the seven major rivers. However, a concern remains: currently, the flood control standards for most rivers are relatively low, typically designed to withstand floods that occur once every 10 to 20 years. Therefore, this green book, which is based on historically documented major floods, will provide reliable data for future decision-making on flood control for major rivers.

　　七大江河等不可轻视防汛
    洪水威胁范围可达７３．８万平方公里
    本报北京５月３１日讯  水利部有关专家最近提出的一份绿皮书表明：黄河、淮河、海河、长江、珠江、辽河、松花江七大江河中下游及沿海数百条河流洪水的威胁范围，为７３．８万平方公里。这片区域集中了全国１／３的耕地，２／５的人口和３／５的工农业总产值，铁路延展长度约１．１万公里。一旦发生江河堤防溃决，后果将不堪设想。
    建国以来，我国经过大规模的江河整治，共计整修、新修堤防１４．８万公里；修建各类水库６万多座，总库容３４００亿立方米；修建水闸１．５万座；并且增辟了海河、淮河排洪入海出路，整修了分蓄洪区和湖泊洼淀，使七大江河的防洪能力有了不同程度的提高。但令人忧虑的是，目前大部分河流的防洪标准普遍较低，仅为１０至２０年一遇。因此，这份以历史上发生过的并查证有据的大洪水淹没范围为依据而形成的洪水威胁范围绿皮书，将为今后制订大江大河防洪决策提供可靠的资料依据。
