Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 16th.

The National Youth Federation held a meeting on June 14th in Beijing for its chairpersons and vice-chairpersons to study Deng Xiaoping's important speech during his meeting with senior military officers of the capital's martial law troops. All attendees agreed that Comrade Xiaoping's speech provided a profound analysis of the causes, nature, and the correctness of the measures taken by the Central Committee regarding the counter-revolutionary rebellion. It also thoroughly expounded on the correctness of the policies, guidelines, and lines established by the Party since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. Everyone expressed their firm support.

In discussing the events that unfolded in Beijing over the past two months, from the student movement to the turmoil and then to the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the attendees agreed that as long as the turmoil and rebellion persist, the people will not have peace, the country will not be stable, and the reform and modernization drive will face difficulties. They highly praised the heroic actions of the martial law troops, the People's Armed Police, and public security officers in defending the People's Republic and safeguarding the people's interests. They expressed strong indignation towards the crimes committed by the counter-revolutionary rioters and hoped that the relevant departments would punish them severely based on facts and the law.

Everyone believes that China's reform and construction is a long and arduous process that must be carried out under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, in accordance with China's national conditions, and through the efforts of the entire nation, especially the younger generation. In the current situation, it is even more necessary for the broad masses of young people to overcome various difficulties, work diligently at their posts, and, with the Party and the people, adhere to the principle of "one center, two basic points" to contribute to the development of China's socialist modernization.

Everyone said that the National Youth Federation, as a patriotic mass organization for the youth of all ethnic groups and sectors in China, should currently play a full role in connecting with the youth, closely uniting the broad masses of middle-aged and young intellectuals and youth from all ethnic groups and sectors, distinguishing right from wrong, considering the overall situation, differentiating between two types of contradictions, and resolutely fighting against the few rioters and those with ulterior motives. They should carefully understand the thoughts and emotions of the broad masses of young people, reflect their reasonable demands and legitimate aspirations through normal democratic channels, actively organize and promote dialogue, enhance understanding and trust, maintain stability and social order, and promote the development of the economy and all other undertakings.

Everyone hopes that all young people from all ethnic groups and sectors who love their country, do not want to see chaos in China, and hope for the revival of China will replace emotions with reason, with high patriotic enthusiasm, support and endorse the correct decisions of the Party and the government, and with practical actions, consciously maintain the overall stability and unity, for the governance of the economic environment, the rectification of the economic order, the comprehensive deepening of the reform, and for the prosperity and progress of the Chinese nation, make new contributions.

　　全国青联领导人学习邓小平同志重要讲话
    各族青年要自觉维护安定团结
    新华社北京６月１６日电  全国青联６月１４日召开在京的主席、副主席会议，认真学习邓小平同志接见首都戒严部队军以上干部时的重要讲话。大家一致认为，小平同志的重要讲话深刻分析了这场反革命暴乱产生的原因、性质和中央采取的措施的正确性，深刻阐述了党的十一届三中全会以来我们党制订的路线、方针和政策的正确性。大家表示坚决拥护。
    与会同志在谈到两个月来在北京发生的从学潮到动乱，到反革命暴乱的过程，认为动乱不止，暴乱不平，人民不得安宁，国家不得安定，改革和四化建设就难以顺利进行。大家对戒严部队、武警部队和公安干警为保卫人民共和国、捍卫人民利益的英勇行为给予了高度的赞扬；对反革命暴徒的罪行表示了极大的愤慨，并希望有关部门以事实为依据，以法律为准绳，予以严惩。
    大家认为，中国的改革和建设是长期艰巨的过程，必须在中国共产党的领导下，按照中国的国情，靠全国人民特别是青年一代用自己的奋斗去实现。在当前的形势下，更需要广大青年克服重重困难，在各自的岗位上，发扬艰苦创业精神，脚踏实地做好本职工作，与党和人民一道，坚持“一个中心，两个基本点”，为中国社会主义现代化事业的发展作出努力。
    大家说，全国青联作为我国各族各界青年的爱国群众团体，当前，应充分发挥联系青年的桥梁纽带作用，紧密团结广大中青年知识分子和各族各界青年，明辨是非，顾全大局，区分两类不同性质的矛盾，向极少数暴乱分子和别有用心的坏人作坚决的斗争。要悉心了解广大青年的思想情绪，通过正常的民主渠道，充分反映青年的正当愿望和合理要求，积极组织和促进对话，增强理解和信任，维护安定团结和社会稳定，推进经济和各项事业的发展。
    大家希望，一切有爱国之心，不愿意看到中国动乱，希望中华振兴的各族各界青年，应以理智代替感情，以高度的爱国热情，支持和拥护党和政府的正确决策，以实际行动，自觉维护安定团结的大局，为治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革，为中华民族的繁荣和进步作出新的贡献。
