In the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital, Liu Guogen and six other martyrs were posthumously granted party membership. Zhou Yiyin and Liu Zhenhua met with Liu Guogen's family.

New China News Agency, Beijing, June 19—Liu Guogen, a second lieutenant in a certain martial law unit and a member of the Communist Youth League, was killed by counter-revolutionary rioters on the morning of June 4 while trying to rescue comrades besieged at the intersection of Xichang'an Street and Xidan, and to protect weapons, ammunition, and communication equipment on the vehicle. Six soldiers from the same unit and members of the Communist Youth League—Wang Qifu, Li Dongguo, Du Huaiqing, Li Qiang, Wang Xiaobing, and Xu Rujun—were on their way to Tiananmen Square to carry out a clearing operation when their vehicle was attacked by rioters throwing stones, bricks, and Molotov cocktails at the Cuiwei Road intersection. The vehicle caught fire and overturned, resulting in the deaths of the six soldiers.

The unit's party committee called on all officers and soldiers to learn from the seven martyrs' spirit of upholding justice, loving the people, hating the enemy, and sacrificing themselves in the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital. They should remain loyal to the Party, the country, and the people, and continue the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary riot to the end.

Liu Guogen sacrificed his young life to defend the republic and the capital. The people of the whole country will not forget him." Liu Zhenhua praised Liu Guogen's courage and fearlessness in the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot. Liu Zhiren, moved, said, "Guogen died for the country, and it was a worthy death. The Party and the government have given the child a high honor, which is the glory of our whole family." Liu Guofeng expressed his determination to carry on his brother's legacy and follow the Party forever.
