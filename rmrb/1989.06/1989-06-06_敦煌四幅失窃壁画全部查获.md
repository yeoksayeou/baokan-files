Today at 17:00, the four Yuan Dynasty murals stolen from the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang were all recovered. This time, the three murals from the west wall of Cave 465 were retrieved. The one from the south wall was recovered on the night of May 27, the day the criminals were apprehended.

After 12 days of policy persuasion, the criminals Li Qingyu and He Congde confessed to their entire crime of stealing the Dunhuang murals together. Based on the criminals' statements, our public security personnel excavated the three murals buried by the criminals in the eastern cemetery of Yumen City. At the same time, two murals that the criminals had peeled off using adhesive tape were also recovered. Additionally, 37 Dunhuang replica paintings, one large Dunhuang painting album, 37 paintbrushes, 26 T-shirts printed with Dunhuang mural patterns, and 13 art fans were seized. These stolen items were respectively packed in plastic woven bags, plastic tubes, and plastic boxes.

Experts and staff from the Dunhuang Research Academy highly praised the significant achievements of our public security officers.

　　敦煌四幅失窃壁画全部查获
    本报兰州６月５日电  记者张述圣报道：今日傍晚１７时，敦煌莫高窟失窃的４幅元代壁画已全部“完璧归赵”。这次追回的是４６５窟西墙上的３幅壁画。南墙的一幅已于５月２７日凌晨案犯被缉捕归案当天查获。
    案犯李清玉、何从德经过１２天的政策攻心，已供认了他们合伙盗窃敦煌壁画的全部罪行。根据案犯供述，我公安人员在玉门市东郊公墓区挖出了案犯埋藏在那里的３幅壁画。同时查获的还有案犯用胶带粘走的２幅壁画；从敦煌莫高窟美术库、菩提荫画苑、工艺商店盗走的敦煌临摹画３７幅、敦煌大画册一本、画笔３７只、印有敦煌壁画图案的汗衫２６件、工艺团扇１３把。这些被盗物品分别装在塑料编织袋、塑料筒和塑料板箱里。
