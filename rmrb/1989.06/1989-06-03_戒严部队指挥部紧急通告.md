	Martial Law Command Headquarters Urgent Announcement
	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 3rd

	The People's Liberation Army of China, in accordance with orders, is executing martial law in certain areas of Beijing. The mission to stop the turmoil and maintain social order in the capital has received the support of various levels of government and the broad masses of the people. However, in recent days, a very small number of people have fabricated rumors, maliciously defamed and attacked the martial law troops, using extremely despicable means to incite the people and the martial law troops against each other. They have instigated some people to block and smash military vehicles, seize weapons, assault officers and soldiers, check and besiege military personnel, and obstruct the actions of the martial law troops, deliberately creating incidents and expanding the turmoil. The serious illegal actions of these very few people have caused great indignation among the broad masses of the people and the officers and soldiers, reaching the point of intolerability.

	We solemnly declare: No one is allowed to intercept military vehicles illegally for any reason, obstruct or besiege the People's Liberation Army, or interfere with the martial law troops in performing their duties. The time, manner, and attire of military operations are all military matters, and no one is allowed to interfere. We will resolutely implement the martial law order of the State Council and the first, second, and third orders of the Beijing Municipal Government. If anyone ignores warnings and persists in breaking the law, the martial law troops, public security personnel, and armed police have the right to take all necessary measures to forcibly deal with the situation, and all consequences will be borne by the organizers and perpetrators. We hope that the broad masses of the people in Beijing will strictly abide by the regulations of the martial law order and support the military in stopping the turmoil and maintaining stability and unity.

    戒严部队指挥部紧急通告
    新华社北京6月3日电　中国人民解放军戒严部队指挥部紧急通告
    中国人民解放军奉命在北京市部分地区执行戒严任务，履行制止动乱，维护首都社会安宁的神圣使命，得到了各级政府和广大人民群众的支持。但是，近日来，极少数人制造谣言，恶意丑化、攻击戒严部队，用极其恶劣的手段，挑拨人民群众和戒严部队之间的关系，煽动一些人堵砸军车、抢夺武器，殴打干部战士，盘查、围攻军人，阻拦戒严部队的行动，蓄意制造事端，扩大动乱。极少数人的这种严重的违法行为，引起了广大人民群众和部队官兵的极大愤慨，已经到了忍无可忍的地步。
    我们郑重宣告：任何人不得以任何借口非法拦截军车，阻拦、围攻解放军，妨碍戒严部队执行勤务。军队行动时间、方式、着装均属军务，任何人不得干预。我们坚决执行国务院戒严令和北京市政府一、二、三号令，如果有人不听劝告，一意孤行，以身试法，戒严部队、公安干警和武警部队有权采取一切手段，强行处置，一切后果由组织者、肇事者负责。希望北京市的广大人民群众严守戒严令的规定，支持军队制止动乱、维护安定团结的行动。
            中国人民解放军戒严部队指挥部
                          一九八九年六月三日
