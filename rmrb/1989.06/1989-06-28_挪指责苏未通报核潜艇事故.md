Norway's Foreign Minister Thorvald Stoltenberg yesterday in Oslo accused the Soviet Union of failing to inform Norway about a nuclear submarine accident.

On Monday morning, a Soviet nuclear submarine had an accident in the northern part of the Norwegian Sea. Norway immediately dispatched aircraft and vessels for rescue operations, but were met with "rude rejections" from the Soviet side. The Soviet Union also did not inform the Norwegian government about the accident. Additionally, on April 7th this year, a Soviet nuclear submarine sank in the northern waters of Norway, and the Soviet Union only notified Norway 12 hours after the accident occurred.

The Norwegian government expressed dissatisfaction with this and called for an international conference to discuss the reporting of nuclear submarine accidents.

Some Norwegian experts believe that the recent nuclear submarine accident may have resulted in nuclear contamination of the submarine, but it is currently not known whether the surrounding environment has been contaminated.

In less than three months, two nuclear submarine accidents have occurred in the waters near northern Norway, causing great concern among Norwegian officials and the media. Some newspapers have accused the Soviet Union of escalating military activities in the waters near northern Norway, posing a serious threat to Norway's security.

　　挪指责苏未通报核潜艇事故
    本报斯德哥尔摩６月２７日电  记者顾耀铭报道：挪威外交大臣斯托尔登贝格昨天在奥斯陆发表讲话，指责苏联未向挪威通报已发生的核潜艇事故。
    这个星期一早晨，苏联的一艘核潜艇在挪威海北部发生事故。挪威方面当即派出飞机和艇只前往营救，但遭到了苏方“粗暴的拒绝”。苏方也没有向挪威政府通报这次事故发生的情况。另外，今年４月７日苏联的一艘核潜艇在挪威北部海域出事沉没，苏联在事故发生１２个小时后才通知挪威。
    挪威政府对此表示不满，呼吁就通报核潜艇事故举行国际会议。
    一些挪威专家认为，最近这次核潜艇事故可能使该艇遭到核污染，但目前尚未污染其周围环境。
    在不到３个月时间内在靠近挪威北部海域区域发生了两起核潜艇事故，挪威官方和舆论界表示非常不安。一些报纸指责苏联加剧了在挪威北部海域的海口军事活动，对挪威的安全已造成了严重威胁。
