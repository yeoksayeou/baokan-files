The Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's Shandong branch has fully leveraged its supervisory and regulatory functions, taking effective measures to clear up various companies with blurred lines between government and business. This has significantly contributed to adjusting the credit structure, stabilizing the market, and controlling prices. By the end of May this year, 1.53 billion yuan in unreasonably occupied funds had been recovered from 1,369 companies. Among these, 2,238 million yuan in loans were completely recovered from 76 companies that violated financial policies, with an additional 1.41 million yuan in penalties.

In recent years, with the rise of the "business fever," various departments and mass organizations have established numerous companies and trade centers under various names. These companies primarily rely on bank loans for their operations, and their large and long-term funding needs have exacerbated the supply-demand contradiction for funds. Some of these companies use loans to hoard goods and speculate on prices, while others exploit loopholes in bank management to open multiple accounts, transfer deposits, and withdraw cash to evade bank supervision, thereby disrupting the normal financial order.

For these types of companies, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's Shandong branch, since October of last year, has seized the opportunity to rectify the economic environment and regulate the financial order. In accordance with higher-level requirements, they have focused on recovering unreasonably occupied funds from companies as a key measure to adjust the credit structure, ensuring impartiality and fairness. For companies with wide involvement and complex situations, they formed joint working groups with the bank, economic commission, finance, industry and commerce, and taxation departments to implement loan recovery plans layer by layer. One company, for example, misappropriated 3.42 million yuan in loans to purchase 200 tons of fertilizer, selling it at high prices for profit. During the investigation, despite various intercessions, the bank and relevant departments not only refused to yield but also recovered the entire loan according to regulations, imposing a penalty of 400,000 yuan.

　　清理各类政企不分公司
    山东收回一亿多元资金
    本报讯  工商银行山东分行充分发挥自身监督调控的职能，采取有效措施清理各类政企不分的公司，为调整信贷结构、稳定市场、平抑物价做出了显著成绩。到今年５月底，已压缩收回１３６９家公司不合理占用资金１．５３亿元，其中对７６家违犯金融政策的公司釜底抽薪，收回全部贷款２２３８万元，并罚息１４１万元。
    近几年来随着“经商热”的兴起，一些党政机关、群众团体以各种名义办起了各类公司和贸易中心。这些公司因主要依靠银行贷款进行经营活动，而且资金需求量大、占用时间长，从而加剧了资金供需矛盾。他们有的利用贷款抢购商品，囤积居奇，待价而沽，有的利用银行管理上的漏洞多头开户，采取转移存款、坐支现金等手段逃避银行监督，破坏了正常的金融秩序。
    对于这类公司，工商银行山东分行自去年１０月份以来，抓住治理经济环境、整顿金融秩序的有利时机，按照上级要求把清理公司不合理占用资金作为调整信贷结构的重点来抓，做到了不徇私情，秉公办事。他们对一些涉及面广、情况复杂的公司，由银行、经委、财政、工商、税务等部门组成联合工作组，层层落实收贷计划。有一家公司挪用３４２万元贷款购进２００吨化肥，卖高价牟取暴利，在清查中又通过各种关系前来说情，银行等部门不仅不予理睬，而且按规定收回全部贷款，还罚息４万元。
