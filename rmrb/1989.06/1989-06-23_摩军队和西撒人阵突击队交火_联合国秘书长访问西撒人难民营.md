Moroccan forces and Polisario Front commandos exchanged fire.

The General Staff of the Moroccan Armed Forces issued a statement today saying that Moroccan forces and Polisario Front commandos clashed from late night on the 21st to early morning on the 22nd in the northeastern part of Western Sahara.

The statement said that a group of 30 Polisario Front commandos infiltrating from Mauritania attempted to attack Moroccan patrols in the Amgala region's defensive wall. After being repelled 200 meters from the Moroccan-controlled line, the commandos retreated back into Mauritania. In this clash, three Polisario Front commandos were killed, and Moroccan forces had one dead and one wounded.
