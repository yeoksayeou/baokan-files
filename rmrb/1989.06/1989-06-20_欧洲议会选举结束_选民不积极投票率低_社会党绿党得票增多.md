Xinhua News Agency, Brussels, June 19th.

The third direct election for the European Parliament concluded on June 18th. According to a statistical report released by the European Statistical Office on June 19th, the number of seats held by the Socialist Party increased from 166 to 182, while the Green Party's seats rose from 20 to 25. The Conservative Party's seats decreased from 178 to 155, and the Liberal Party's seats dropped from 46 to 44. Other parties also saw varying degrees of reduction in their seats.

According to the statistics from the European Community, the average voter turnout across the 12 countries was 58.6%, slightly lower than the 61% recorded during the second election in 1984. Belgium had the highest turnout at 92.1%, while the United Kingdom had the lowest at 37%.

The President of the European Parliament, Pierre Pflimlin, complained at a press conference in Strasbourg today about the media's indifferent attitude towards this election and the lack of effective promotion.

The European Parliament elections have been held every five years by popular vote since 1979, with 518 seats distributed among the 12 countries of the European Community based on population.

Xinhua News Agency, Paris, June 19th.

Only half of the French voters participated in the election for the new European Parliament yesterday. The opposition led by former President Valéry Giscard d'Estaing secured nearly 30% of the votes, while the Socialist Party, led by Laurent Fabius, received 23.6% of the votes, which was lower than expected.

The low voter turnout was a notable feature of this election. The primary reasons include the fact that the European Parliament is not the national parliament and thus has no direct impact on the political lives of the people. Additionally, the French public has grown weary of frequent elections, having voted 10 times in the 14 months since the presidential election last May.

Xinhua News Agency, Rome, June 19th.

Italy held its European Parliament election yesterday, with the results showing that the basic political landscape of the major parties remained unchanged. The vote distribution was as follows: Christian Democracy 32.9%, Communist Party 27.6%, Socialist Party 14.8%, and other parties each received less than 10%.

Italy has 81 seats in the European Parliament. Based on the vote distribution, Christian Democracy will have 27 seats, the Communist Party 22 seats, the Socialist Party 12 seats, and the remaining seats will be distributed among other parties.

Italy's voter turnout was 81.5%, the lowest in its history.

Xinhua News Agency, London, June 19th.

The results of the British European Parliament election were announced today, with the Labour Party securing 45 seats compared to the Conservative Party's 32, marking the Labour Party's first nationwide victory in a decade.

Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher expressed disappointment with the election results. Commentators attributed the Conservative Party's defeat to inflation and its pro-American, anti-European policies.

Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, June 18th.

In the European Parliament election held in West Germany today, the ruling coalition party secured 32 seats, while the main opposition party, the Social Democratic Party, obtained 30 seats. The Republican Party received over 7% of the votes, securing 7 seats. The Green Party's vote share remained the same as five years ago, retaining 7 seats.

The chairman of the CDU, West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, and the chairman of the SPD, Oskar Lafontaine, both expressed disappointment with the election results.

Xinhua News Agency, Lisbon, June 19th.

According to official statistics released today, Portugal's European Parliament members have been elected. The Social Democratic Party secured the most seats. Over 8 million voters participated in the election.
