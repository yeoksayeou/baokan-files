People's Daily, Tokyo, June 1st.

Reported by Yu Qing: Today in the afternoon, the Speaker of the Japanese House of Representatives, Hara Kenichiro, submitted his resignation to the Deputy Speaker, Takaoka Masatoshi.

On May 28th, the opposition parties proposed a no-confidence motion, demanding that Speaker Hara Kenichiro take responsibility for the Liberal Democratic Party's unilateral passage of the annual budget and the extension of the parliamentary session in the House of Representatives, and resign. Initially, Hara Kenichiro refused to resign. However, after the new LDP president was determined yesterday, to avoid an awkward situation where the opposition parties might refuse to attend the parliamentary session to elect the new prime minister tomorrow, Hara Kenichiro decided to resign. The new Speaker of the House of Representatives is likely to be former Minister of International Trade and Industry, Tamura.

　　为选新首相廓清道路
    日众院议长辞职
    本报东京６月１日电  记者于青报道：今天下午，日本众院议长原健三郎向副议长多贺谷真稔递交了辞呈。
    在野党５月２８日提出不信任案，要求众院议长原健三郎对自民党在众院单独表决强行通过本年度预算案和延长国会会期承担责任，引咎辞职。最初原健三郎拒绝辞职。昨天自民党新总裁人选明朗化后，为了避免明天在野党拒绝出席指定选举新内阁首相的国会会议出现尴尬局面，原健三郎决意辞职。新众院议长可能由前通产相田村担任。
