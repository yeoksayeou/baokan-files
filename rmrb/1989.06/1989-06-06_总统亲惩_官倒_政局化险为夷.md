Zimbabwean President Mugabe accepted the resignations of Minister of State Shava and Minister of Defense Nkomo in March this year. Nkomo was also removed from his positions as a member of the Central Political Bureau and Financial Secretary of the ruling Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF). The two high-ranking officials stepped down due to their involvement in a car resale scandal, and their false testimonies during the investigation were exposed by the media.

In recent years, Zimbabwe has faced a severe shortage of foreign exchange, leading to a significant imbalance in the domestic car market. The annual demand for cars nationwide is over 100,000, but the country's sole state-owned car assembly plant, Willowvale, has an annual assembly capacity of less than 4,000 vehicles. Taking advantage of this situation, some high-ranking officials in the party and government used their positions to purchase cars at state-regulated prices from the plant and then resell them at inflated prices on the black market, enriching themselves in the process. In November last year, the Zimbabwean newspaper *Bulawayo Chronicle* published a series of articles exposing this scandal, naming more than a dozen ministers and high-ranking officials involved in the case. This revelation caused a national uproar and the case was dubbed the "Willowvale Scandal." People from all walks of life demanded that the government investigate the case and punish the culprits.

Some of the named ministers and high-ranking officials held a grudge against the *Bulawayo Chronicle* and retaliated against the newspaper, with Nkomo being the most aggressive. Using his positions as Minister of Defense and Acting Minister of Home Affairs, he "ordered" the newspaper's editor, Nyathi, to report to his office, threatening to use the military and police to bring him in if he refused. After Nyathi resolutely rejected Nkomo's summons, the Ministry of Information "compulsorily" transferred him to a nominal position as the Public Relations Director of the Zimbabwe Newspaper Management Agency. This move sparked widespread outrage and further deepened public dissatisfaction with the ruling party and the government.

President Mugabe took the issues raised by the media very seriously. To ease tensions and stabilize public sentiment, he personally intervened and took several measures:

1. Establishing an investigative committee to conduct a thorough investigation. At the end of February, Mugabe appointed a three-person investigative committee headed by Chief Justice Sandura. The committee was tasked with investigating the sale of cars directly from the Willowvale Motor Assembly Plant to individuals and was required to submit its findings to the president by the end of March. Mugabe granted the committee extensive powers, requiring it to hold public hearings and thoroughly investigate the issues. The investigative committee held 28 hearings, with 72 witnesses, including high-ranking ministers, the foreign minister, the minister of industry and technology, the minister of higher education, the minister of defense, the minister of state, the deputy minister of state, the deputy minister of energy and water resources, and the army commander. The revelations were severe. For instance, a high-ranking minister had used his influence to purchase nearly 40 cars from the assembly plant for his relatives and friends at regulated prices. Both the minister of defense, Nkomo, and the minister of state, Shava, were found to have resold cars at prices two to three times higher than the regulated prices. Some officials also colluded with businessmen to earn commissions through car purchases. This public exposure significantly dampened the authority of these ministers, who had to admit their guilt in the face of the evidence.

2. Seriously and cautiously handling guilty and errant high-ranking officials. As the issues became clearer, Mugabe took the initiative to handle the situation internally, requiring those with severe offenses and significant public outrage to resign voluntarily. For ministers involved in the car resale case but not yet needing to be dismissed, appropriate actions were also taken to show punishment. Many of the high-ranking officials who fell in the car case were Mugabe's old comrades, who had made significant contributions during the armed struggle and in consolidating the new government after independence. Although Mugabe expressed "regret" for them, he believed that to maintain government integrity and national stability, it was necessary to adhere to the principle of equality before the law. He stated, "Revolutionaries who make mistakes should be treated the same as the people, and even more severely punished."

3. Strictly enforcing integrity and conducting propaganda and education. Since the second half of last year, when university students held anti-corruption protests, Mugabe has paid considerable attention to anti-corruption education within the party, criticizing corruption, and emphasizing that the current central task of the party is to eliminate corrupt elements within the party and government. He reiterated the "leadership principles," showing no leniency. He said, "Socialist leaders must choose between power and wealth; they cannot have both." He also expressed his intention to gradually promote the "principles" to all levels of party, government, and military officials, launching an anti-corruption campaign nationwide.

Mugabe himself pays attention to leading by example. He donated the $100,000 (approximately $50,000 USD) prize money awarded to him by the International Anti-Hunger Organization to establish the National Scholarship Fund, which was well-received by the public.

The Willowvale car resale case is the biggest scandal to occur among the high-ranking leadership in the nine years since Zimbabwe's independence. This incident has had a negative impact on the political reputation of Mugabe's government. However, due to Mugabe's timely handling and proactive measures, a social and political crisis was avoided, and positive social effects were achieved.

1. Effectively striking back at opposition forces. The emergence of the Willowvale car resale case provided an excuse for a small number of discontented individuals in society to oppose the government. Since the beginning of the year, led by Tekere (former general secretary of the ZANU-PF, expelled from the party last year), the social opposition forces have used this as a pretext to raise the banner of anti-corruption, once again putting pressure on the government, openly demanding Mugabe's resignation, and threatening to organize a new party to oppose the ZANU-PF. This received a response from a small number of radical elements in society and the parliament, and even within the government, there were individual sympathizers. In this situation, Mugabe, on the one hand, promptly organized the Sandura Committee to investigate the case and handle it seriously, proving the government's determination to fight corruption. On the other hand, he used the media to expose the motives of socially discontented individuals who vent their private grudges and disrupt social stability. Additionally, Mugabe took a high stance, expressing his willingness to allow Tekere to organize a new party and participate in next year's elections, thereby winning over the masses and stabilizing the political situation.

2. Alleviating some of the public's dissatisfaction. The Zimbabwean public had long been aware of certain corrupt practices among the leadership, leading to increased dissatisfaction with the government. There were hopes for the replacement of some ministers. After the resignations of Nkomo and Shava, the public applauded, and trust in the government increased.

3. Beneficial to the unity of the ruling party. The Zimbabwe African National Union - Patriotic Front (ZANU-PF) congress is scheduled to be held in the second half of this year. The ZANU-PF is a merger of the original ZANU and the original ZAPU, and the emergence of the Willowvale car case had cast a shadow over the smooth convening of the congress. However, Mugabe's impartial administration and appropriate handling of the situation dispelled the doubts of the original ZAPU members. Throughout the investigation process, the original ZAPU did not use this as an opportunity to stir up trouble but instead actively cooperated to resolve the issue appropriately.

　　总统亲惩“官倒”政局化险为夷
    罗朝文　史永久　张敬雷
    津巴布韦总统穆加贝于今年３月接受了国务部长夏瓦和国防部长恩卡拉的“辞职”。恩卡拉还同时被解除执政的民族联盟党中央政治局委员和财政书记之职。这两名权势显赫的高级官员之所以下台，是因为参与了汽车倒卖案，且在被调查时作假证词遭到了新闻界的揭露。
    近年来，津巴布韦由于外汇短缺，国内市场上汽车供求矛盾十分突出。全国的年需求量为１０多万辆，而国内唯一的维罗维尔国营汽车装配厂的年装配能力不到４０００辆。在这种情况下，党和政府的部分高级官员利用职权，以国家规定的平价从该厂套购汽车，再以高价到黑市上转卖，从中大饱私囊。去年１１月，津《布拉瓦约纪事报》发表系列文章，揭露这一丑闻，并且点了参与此事的十几个部长和高级官员的名，引起全国轰动，此案被群众称为“维罗维尔门丑闻”。各阶层人士纷纷向政府提出责问，要求查处此案，惩办有关人员。
    少数被点名的部长和高级官员对《布拉瓦约纪事报》怀恨在心，对该报进行打击报复和恫吓威胁，其中以恩卡拉最甚。他以国防部长和代理内政部长的身份，“命令”该报主编尼亚罗塔到他办公室报到，否则就要动用军队和警察把他抓来。在尼亚罗塔义正词严地拒绝恩卡拉的“传讯”后，新闻部又“强制性”地将他调至津报业管理局任公关主任的虚职。全国舆论为之哗然，进一步加深了对执政党和政府的不满。
    穆加贝总统对新闻界揭发的问题极为重视，为缓和矛盾，稳定民心，他亲自出面做工作，相继采取了一些措施：
    一、成立调查委员会彻底调查。２月底穆加贝任命了以大法官桑多拉为首的３人调查委员会，责其查清维罗维尔汽车装配厂直接向个人出售汽车的情况，于３月底前将调查结果报告总统。穆加贝授予该委员会很大权力，要求公开举行听证会，面向公众，尽量将问题揭深查透。调查委员会共举行听证会２８次，应召作证的７２人中有高级部长、外长、工业技术部长、高教部长、国防部长、国务部长、国务部副部长、能源水利部副部长以及陆军司令等。经揭发，有些问题是严重的。如高级部长近年来批条子直接从汽车装配厂为其亲朋好友购车近４０辆。国防部长恩卡拉和国务部长夏瓦均以高出平价二三倍的价格倒卖。还有少数官员与商人勾结，利用买车之便获取佣金。这种公开的揭发大煞了这些部长的威风，他们在事实面前不得不低头认罪。
    二、严肃而慎重地处理有罪及犯错误的高级官员。随着问题的明朗化，穆加贝力争主动，在内部做了大量工作，要求情节严重、民愤较大者主动提出辞职；对那些与汽车倒卖案有牵连、但还不必罢官的部长也做了适当处理，以示惩罚。在汽车案中栽跟头的高级官员大多是穆加贝的老战友，在武装斗争年代和独立后巩固新政权的斗争中立下过汗马功劳。穆加贝虽对他们表示“惋惜”，但他认为，为使政府廉洁和国家稳定，必须坚持法律面前人人平等这一基本原则。他说，“革命家”犯错误，应与民同罪，甚至要比普通人受到更加严厉的惩处。
    三、狠抓廉政和宣传教育。自去年下半年大学生举行反腐败游行后，穆加贝一直比较重视党内的廉政教育，抨击贪污腐败现象，强调目前党的中心任务是清除党和政府内的腐败分子，重申“领导人准则”，决不迁就姑息。他说，“社会主义的领导人必须在权力和财富之间进行选择”，不能兼得。他还表示要将“准则”逐步推广于党、政、军各级官员，在全国掀起反腐败运动。
    穆加贝本人注意身体力行，他捐出了国际反饥饿组织授予他的１０万津元（约５万美元）奖金，设立国家奖学金基金会，受到公众的好评。
    维罗维尔汽车倒卖案是津独立９年来在高层领导中发生的一起最大丑闻。这给穆加贝政府的政治声誉带来不利影响，但由于穆加贝处置及时，争取了主动，从而避免了一场社会政治危机，并且收到了积极的社会效益。
    一、有力地打击了反对势力。维罗维尔汽车倒卖案的出现，为社会少数不满分子提供了反政府的口实。年初以来，以特克雷（民盟前总书记，去年被开除出党）为首的社会反对势力以此为由头，打着反腐败旗号，再次向政府施加压力，公开要求穆加贝下台，并扬言要组织新政党，与民盟党作对。这得到社会上和议会中少数激进分子的响应，甚至政府内部也出现了个别同情者。在此情况下，穆加贝一方面及时组织桑多拉委员会调查此案，严肃处理，用事实证明政府反腐败的决心，另一方面又利用新闻媒介揭露社会不满分子发泄私愤，扰乱社会稳定的目的。此外，穆加贝还采取高姿态，表示允许特克雷组织新党，参加明年大选，从而争取了群众，稳定了政局。
    二、平息了部分群众的不满情绪。津群众对领导层出现的某些腐败现象早有所闻，对政府的不满情绪有所增加。希望能撤换一些部长。恩卡拉和夏瓦辞职后，群众拍手称快，对政府的信任增强了。
    三、有利于执政党的团结。执政党津民盟党代会将于今年下半年召开。津民盟系原民盟和原人盟联合而成，维罗维尔汽车案的出现曾给大会的顺利召开蒙上了阴影。但穆加贝秉公执法，处理得当，打消了原人盟党成员的疑虑。在整个调查过程中，原人盟并未就此做文章，相反，还主动配合使问题得到妥善解决。
