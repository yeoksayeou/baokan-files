In recent days, the capital Beijing has witnessed numerous touching scenes of mutual support between the military and the people, adding a new chapter to the "bond between soldiers and civilians" in the history of the People's Republic.

According to incomplete statistics from relevant departments, from the 8th to the 10th, the martial law troops dispatched 318 vehicles to transport 2,230,000 kilograms of grain for the capital's residents. The People's Armed Police also dispatched 10 vehicles today to transport 136 tons of salt for the people of the capital. Meanwhile, millions of letters of encouragement have been sent from various government agencies, enterprises, and households in the capital to the martial law troops' garrisons.

This morning, a retired teacher from the Sixth Primary School in Ping'anli handed a letter filled with love for the people's children soldiers and 200 yuan to the officers and soldiers of a certain martial law unit, tears streaming down his face as he said, "It is our children soldiers who have protected the capital of the Republic and the safety of the people."

The manager of the Bingxue Dian (Ice Cream Shop) in Beixin Bridge saw more than 30 officers and soldiers of a certain martial law unit guarding the intersection of Beixin Bridge day and night, feeling deeply grateful. He bought 40 cups of milk and 4 packs of cigarettes with his own money to give to the martial law soldiers.

Today, the main leaders of the Haidian District Party Committee and Government visited the military garrison to visit the martial law troops. They brought 2,000 kilograms of vegetables and cigarettes. The staff of the Tonghe Restaurant in Haidian District worked overtime to prepare 1,000 servings of dumplings for the troops.

A retired couple from the Shuangyushu Community requested that the district government convey 100 yuan to the martial law troops. A retired female worker living on Qinglongqiao Street handed over her remaining 500 yuan to the relevant department to express her sympathy for the families of fallen and injured soldiers.

In recent days, people have seen on many major roads that some martial law troops, with injuries on their heads and feet, are still clearing away various vehicles burned by rioters and obstacles set up on the roads. According to relevant departments, all roadblocks on major roads in the city have been cleared. Today, 166 public bus routes have been restored. This is the result of joint efforts by the military and the people.

Today, reporters saw on the streets of Beijing the lively scene of certain martial law troops' officers and soldiers performing their duties in a civilized manner.

When pedestrians and motor vehicles pass through Qianmen West Street, the soldiers on duty salute solemnly. In front of a large building, the soldiers on duty to maintain martial law, with smiles on their faces, politely ask for identification and say, "Sorry for the trouble, sorry for the trouble, and for taking up your time, please proceed." Under the Qianmen Archery Tower, several women speaking Sichuan dialect asked the soldiers on duty for directions, and the soldiers on duty actively led the way for them.

Officer Liu Shunkao told reporters that to ensure civilized duty performance, the unit has formulated ten regulations for civilized duty performance, which the officers and soldiers strictly abide by, and there have been no violations of civilized duty performance.

After entering the city, the unit has maintained strict discipline among the people and insisted on civilized duty performance under the conditions of not being able to eat well, drink hot water, and having no place to stay for four consecutive days and nights. During the four days of camping, it rained three times, but not a single soldier entered the residents' homes to avoid the rain, did not disturb the normal life of the residents, and dispelled the residents' misunderstandings. On the first day, a few elderly women came out to watch, seeing the soldiers standing guard in the rain, soaked to the skin, and not moving around at will, always maintaining neat formations and dignified military posture, which deeply moved them. The elderly women hurried back home, leading their families to bring hot water and porridge, insisting that the soldiers on duty drink them to warm up. Their actual actions of civilized duty performance have won the trust of the local people.

　　首都出现拥军爱民新热潮
    戒严部队某部在首都街头文明执勤
    据新华社北京六月十日电  连日来，在首都北京街头出现了许多军爱民和民拥军的动人情景，为人民共和国的史册增添了“军民鱼水情”的新篇章。
    据有关部门的不完全统计，从八日到今天的三天时间里，戒严部队为首都居民出动三百一十八辆汽车，运送粮食二百二十三万多公斤；武警部队也在今天出动十辆汽车，为首都人民运送食盐一百三十六吨。与此同时，数以千万计的慰问信，从首都的许多机关、企业和家庭飞往戒严部队的驻地。
    今天早上，和平里第六小学的一位离休教师将一封洋溢着对人民子弟兵热爱之情的慰问信和二百元人民币交到某戒严部队官兵手里时，老泪纵横，感慨万千地说：“是咱们的子弟兵保卫了共和国首都和人民的安全。”
    北新桥冷饮店经理看到某戒严部队的三十多名官兵日夜守卫在北新桥路口，心里十分感激，便自己掏钱，买了四十杯牛奶和四条香烟，送给戒严官兵。
    今天，海淀区区委、区政府主要领导来到解放军驻地，看望戒严部队的官兵。他们送去了二千公斤蔬菜和香烟等。海淀区同和饭庄的职工，加班加点，包了供一千人吃的饺子，送给部队官兵。
    双榆树小区一名离休干部夫妇二人来到居委会，请区政府转交给戒严部队一百元钱。家住青龙桥街道的一位退休女工拿出自己仅存的五百元钱交给有关部门，以表示对死伤子弟兵亲属的一点心意。
    连日来，人们在许多交通要道上看到，戒严部队官兵中有的头上和脚上带着伤，还在那里清除暴徒烧毁的各种车辆和设置的路障。据有关部门介绍，目前全市各主要交通路口的路障已全部清除。今日，全市已有一百六十六条公共电汽车线路开通。这是军民协同努力的成果。
    新华社北京六月十一日电　今天，记者在北京街头看见戒严部队某部官兵文明执勤的生动场面。
    当行人和机动车辆通过前门西大街时，在路口执勤的军人行庄严的注目礼。在一幢大楼前执行戒严任务的士兵，面带笑容地请对方出示证件，然后说：“麻烦了，麻烦了，担误了你的时间，请通行。”在前门箭楼下，几位操四川话的妇女向执勤的战士问路，执勤战士主动为她们领路。
    在场的军官刘顺开告诉记者，为了确保文明执勤，这支部队制订了文明执勤的十条规定，部队官兵严格遵守，没有发生违反文明执勤的行为。
    这支部队进城后，在连续四天四夜吃不好饭、喝不上开水、又没有住处的情况下，始终严守群众纪律，坚持文明执勤。在露营的四天中，先后下了三场雨，部队官兵没有一人进入市民家躲雨，不打扰群众的正常生活，消除了群众的误解。头一天，有几位老太太出来观望，见战士一个个冒雨执勤露宿，浑身湿透也没人随意走动，始终保持着整齐的队形和端庄的军姿，使她们深受感动。老太太纷纷折回家去，带领家人送来开水、稀饭，执意让执勤战士喝下去，暖暖身子。他们文明执勤的实际行动，赢得了驻地人民的信赖。
