    Lanzhou Sees Increase in Fires
    According to data provided by the Lanzhou City Public Security Fire Department in Gansu Province, there were 15 fires in the city in the first three months of this year, resulting in 3 deaths, 2 injuries, and economic losses amounting to 88,400 yuan. Compared to the same period last year, the number of deaths increased by 33.3%, and the number of injuries increased by 50%.

    First, there has been an increase in arson cases. On the evening of March 1, a resident of Ping'an Township in Honggu District, Zhang Nianlong, had a quarrel with his wife after drinking alcohol. In a fit of rage, he poured gasoline on the kang (traditional heated bed) and set it on fire, burning his wife and son to death. Zhang himself also perished in the fire.

    Second, a significant proportion of fires are caused by violations of operational procedures. On the afternoon of March 25, an employee of the Lanzhou Glass Factory was adjusting a gas stove in a rented stall on the first floor of the South Gate Market Department Store. Due to improper operation, a fire broke out, severely burning a 10-year-old girl who was passing by.

    The city's fire department believes that the summer season, with its strong winds and dry conditions, is a high-risk period for fires. Therefore, fire prevention work must not be taken lightly.

    兰州火灾增多
    本报讯　据甘肃省兰州市公安消防部门提供的数据，今年前3个月全市共发生火灾15起，死3人，伤2人，经济损失8.84万元。与去年同期相比，死亡人数上升33.3％，伤创人数上升50％。
    一是人为地造成火灾事故增多。3月1日晚，红古区平安乡社员张念龙酒后与妻子发生口角，张怀恨在心，竟将汽油洒在炕上，点火引燃被褥成灾，将其妻子、儿子当即烧死，张亦被葬身火海之中。
    二是违章操作引起火灾所占比例较大。3月25日中午，兰州制镜厂一营业员在南关什字百货大楼一楼租赁柜台调试汽化炉时，违章操作引起火灾，将路过此地一10岁女孩烧成重伤。
    该市消防部门认为，夏季风大干燥，是火灾的多发季节，对防火工作不可掉以轻心。　（苟亚军）
