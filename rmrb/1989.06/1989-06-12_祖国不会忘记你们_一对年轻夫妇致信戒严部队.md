The Martial Law Command Headquarters News Office reported on June 12 that on the morning of June 11, a young couple from Changsha City brought 100 yuan in cash and two letters written by themselves and their son, specially requesting the Hunan Provincial Military Area Command to forward their items to the martial law troops in Beijing. An officer from the provincial military area command who received them was deeply moved and said, "Your intentions, I accept on behalf of the martial law troops, but the troops cannot accept this money." They insisted, saying, "Please buy some nutritional supplies to comfort the wounded, or hand them over to the families of the martyrs. The money is little, but our intentions are sincere. Please accept it on behalf of our families." After saying this, they turned to leave. The officer quickly stopped them and asked for their address and names. They said, "We both work in Changsha. I am an engineer, and my wife is a teacher. We are both Communist Party members." Below is the full text of the letter from the young couple:

Dear Martial Law Troops in Beijing,

Greetings! You have worked hard! We embrace you—the dearest people of our republic.

In this special battle of martial law in the capital, different from the old mountain front, you have endured humiliation, sacrificed precious lives, and defended our sacred China. These days, we have repeatedly shed hot tears as we gazed at your faces and figures on the television, seeing you in the crowd, drenched in sweat and soaked uniforms, our hearts ached; seeing your bleeding wounds and the bodies of the martyrs, our hearts broke; when we saw your majestic figures appear at Tiananmen Square, our hearts rejoiced. What fine soldiers, what fine army! Dear comrades, in these 20 days, you have indeed suffered hardships. To quell the counter-revolutionary riots in the capital, we know that you have no complaints about eating and sleeping in the open, fearing neither fire nor water, and your only wish is for the people's understanding and support. Dear comrades, please rest assured, the broad masses of the people stand with you, and as time passes, the truth will prevail, and those who originally did not understand you will eventually stand with the People's Liberation Army, together protecting the two truths that countless national pioneers have fought for over the years: "Without the Communist Party, there would be no new China." "Only socialism can save China."

People yearn for peace and stability, and this is the foundation of the people's understanding and support for you. During the Cultural Revolution, we were only in our teens, but the lawless chaos is still fresh in our memory. Recently, seeing the parades, petitions, and sit-ins on the streets, we felt our hair stand on end and our bodies shiver. Some people shout for "freedom," but they cause you to lose the freedom to go out, these people shout for "democracy," but you don't even have the right to speak the truth. The tragedy of the Cultural Revolution has delayed China for an entire generation; do we want to repeat that history today? Therefore, we couldn't help but think of our child who is still in elementary school. That human disaster must not befall the next generation. Therefore, you, following the orders of the Party Central Committee, quickly ended the chaos in the capital, winning the hearts of the people. You have protected the interests of the broad masses of the people and, more importantly, protected the future of the motherland. The people of the entire nation thank you, our family thanks you, and our child thanks you. At this moment, we really want to come from the south of the motherland to Beijing, kiss the sweat on your uniforms, hold your hands, and have a heart-to-heart talk with you, bring you some water at the martial law post, or help the wounded in the hospital with our little strength, or pour wine and offer flowers at the martyrs' graves to mourn the heroes. But due to work reasons, we cannot be in Beijing to see you, so today we can only send this 100 yuan through the Hunan Provincial Military Area Command as a small token of our affection, or buy some soda and drinks for you to quench your thirst while on duty; or buy some nutritional supplies on our behalf to comfort the wounded in the hospital; or hand them over to the families of the martyrs. In short, the money is little, but our intentions are deep. Please accept it on behalf of our families. As long as we can reduce your fatigue a little, as long as the wounded can recover quickly, we will be at ease.

Dear comrades, the battle continues. The motherland has not forgotten you, the people have not forgotten you, and history will remember your great achievements. Finally, please believe our prophecy: when you one day end the martial law and return to your camp, Tiananmen Square will surely echo with the sound of grand salutes, the people of the capital will surely line the streets to welcome your glorious return, and at that time, the billion people of the entire nation will surely see your military might and style on television again, cheering and paying tribute to the heroes of the republic!

Long live the great People's Liberation Army of China!

With respect,

Two Communist Party Members from Changsha, Hunan

　　祖国不会忘记你们
    ——一对年轻夫妇致信戒严部队
    戒严部队指挥部新闻处６月１２日消息６月１１日上午，长沙市一对年轻夫妇带着１００元现金及夫妇俩和儿子分别写的两封慰问信，专程来到湖南省军区恳请省军区将其转寄北京戒严部队。接待他们的一位省军区机关干部很受感动，说：“你们的心意我代表戒严部队收下，但这些钱部队不能收。”他们说啥也不同意，说：“请代我们买些营养品慰问伤员，或转交烈士遗属，钱少意小，请亲人们收下吧。”说完转身就走。这位机关干部忙拉住他们留下地址和姓名。他说：“我俩在长沙工作，我是工程师，妻子是教师，都是共产党员。”下面是这对年轻夫妇来信的全文：亲爱的北京戒严部队全体指战员们：
    你们好！你们辛苦了！拥抱你们——我们共和国最最亲爱的人。
    在首都戒严这场不同于老山前线的特殊战斗中，你们忍辱负重，牺牲宝贵生命，捍卫我神圣中华。这些日子里，我们多次流着热泪端详着电视机中你们的面孔和身影，看着你们在人群推拉中的那满脸汗珠和湿透的军装，我们的心焦了；看着你们淌着鲜血的伤口和烈士的遗体，我们的心碎了；当看到你们威武的英姿出现在天安门广场时，我们的心又乐了。多么好的战士，多么好的军队啊！亲人啊，在这２０天里，你们确实受苦受累了，为平息首都的反革命暴乱，我们深知你们无怨于风餐露宿，无畏于赴汤蹈火，唯一渴望的只是人民的理解和支持。亲人们请放心吧，广大人民是与你们站在一起的，而且随着时间的推移，正义之师昭示天下，事实的真相越来越清楚，那些原来不理解你们的少数善良人，也终将会与解放军一条心，共卫多少民族先驱多年奋斗才得来的两条真理：“没有共产党就没有新中国。”“只有社会主义才能救中国。”
    人心思安，人心思定，这就是人民理解和支持你们的基础。文化革命中我们才是十几岁的中学生，可那无法无天的混乱局面，我们至今记忆犹新。前段对着街上的游行，请愿静坐，我们头皮发麻，浑身发冷。某些人口口声声要“自由”，可闹得你连出门行路都无自由，这些人震耳欲聋喊“民主”，但你连说句实事求是的话的权利都没有，“文革”的悲剧已整整耽误了中国一代人；难道今天还要重演那段历史吗？为此我们不由自主地想到了自己那还在读小学的孩子，那种人间灾难无论如何也不能落到下一代身上了。因此你们奉党中央的命令，迅速结束首都的混乱局面，大得民心，你们保护了广大人民的利益，更保护了祖国的下一代。全国人民感谢你们，我们全家人感谢你们，我们的孩子更感谢你们。此时此刻，我们真想从祖国的南方来到北京，吻一吻你们军装上的汗水，握一握你们的双手，与你们讲上几句知心话，赶到戒严哨位向你们送上几口水，或到医院帮助伤员尽我们的一点力，或到烈士遗体前洒酒献花祭慰英灵。但由于工作关系，我们不能亲临北京与你们一见，今天只能通过湖南省军区捎上这１００元钱的小小心意，或购点汽水饮料供你们执勤解渴之用；或代我们购些营养品送往医院慰问伤员；或请你们转交烈士遗属。总之，钱少意深，请亲人们收下吧，只要能减轻你们一点疲劳，只要伤员们能早日恢复健康，我们就安心了。
    亲人们，战斗仍在继续，祖国没有忘记你们，人民没有忘记你们，历史更会铭记你们的丰功伟绩。最后请相信我们的预言吧，当你们有朝一日结束戒严，班师回营时，天安门广场一定会响起隆重的礼炮声，首都人民一定会拥上街头夹道欢送你们的光荣凯旋，到时全国亿万人民也一定会在电视机前再睹你们的军威风采，向共和国的英雄欢呼，致敬！
    伟大的中国人民解放军万岁！
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　致礼！
