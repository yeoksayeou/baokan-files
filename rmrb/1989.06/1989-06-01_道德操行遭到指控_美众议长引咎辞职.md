People's Daily, Washington, May 31st, Reporter Cang Lide:

U.S. House Speaker, Texas Democrat Jim Wright, announced today in Congress that he will resign from his position as Speaker next Tuesday and relinquish his seat as a representative by the end of June. This decision aims to quell the "anger and hostility" surrounding his personal financial issues. Wright will be the first House Speaker in U.S. history to step down due to moral conduct problems.

The 66-year-old Wright has been a representative of the Worthburg district in Texas since 1955. In April, the House Ethics Committee unanimously accused him of 69 violations of House regulations and ethical standards in his personal financial activities. In his hour-long speech to the House this afternoon, Wright was emotional, refuting the main charges against him one by one. He admitted to "mistakes" but denied any "improper" behavior. He stated that his resignation would prevent the Congress from "dissolving" and allow it to handle "important national affairs." He also urged members of both parties in Congress to abandon "foolish infighting" and make his departure a starting point to avoid escalating partisan political warfare.

Local commentators believe that Wright's resignation is the culmination of a series of political setbacks for the Democratic Party. Just days ago, the third-ranking Democrat in the House, Tony Coelho, who was seen as the most likely candidate to lead the Democratic Party, also announced his resignation after the House began investigating his personal financial behavior. Today, the Justice Department announced an investigation into the "illegal leaking of political intelligence" by the fourth-ranking Democrat, William Gray.

It is understood that Wright's resignation will exempt him from the Ethics Committee's prosecution and conviction; his position as Speaker will be taken over by the majority leader of the House (Democrat) Tom Foley.

### 道德操行遭到指控  美众议长引咎辞职

　　道德操行遭到指控
    美众议长引咎辞职
    本报华盛顿５月３１日电  记者仓立德报道：美国国会众议院议长、得克萨斯州民主党人吉姆·赖特今天在国会正式宣布，他将于下周二辞去议长职务，并在６月底前放弃议员职务，以平息围绕他的私人经济问题而引起的“愤怒和敌意”。赖特将成为美国有史以来首位因道德操行问题而被迫下台的议长。
    ６６岁的赖特是３４年前作为得克萨斯沃思堡选区代表进入众院的。今年４月众院道德委员会全体成员一致指控他在个人经济活动中有６９处违反了众院的规定和道德准则。在下午对众院发表的长达１小时的演说中，赖特情绪激动，他逐条反驳了对他的主要指控。他承认自己有“错误”，但否认有任何“失当”行为。他说他的辞职将使国会免于“涣散”，以便处理国家的“重要事务”。他还要求国会两党议员放弃“愚蠢的自相残杀”，“使我的离职成为一个开端”，以避免党派政治战争的升级。
    此间评论家认为，赖特的去职是民主党近来遭受的一系列政治挫折的高潮。数日前，众院民主党第三号人物，最有希望问鼎民主党领袖的民主党督导托尼·克维罗，也因众院开始调查其个人经济行为而宣布辞职。今日，司法部又宣布调查众院民主党第四号人物威廉·格雷的“非法泄露政治情报”行为。
    据悉，赖特辞职将使他免除道德委员会对他的起诉及定罪；其议长职位将由众院多数党（民主党）领袖托玛斯·弗利接任。
