The Sichuan Television Station has extended its vision beyond the Sichuan Basin, directing its cameras towards China and the world, thereby expanding the range of television drama themes.

The Sichuan Television Station has created several "firsts": it was the first to shoot on location overseas, with the television drama "Love in Mombasa" being nominated for the "Flying Sky Award" this year; it was the first to send a team to the Antarctic, and last November, it sent a crew led by Jin Naiqian to the Antarctic with a scientific expedition to shoot the television series "The Great Wall Extends South."

In addition to the coldest place, the Antarctic, and the hottest place, Africa, the Sichuan Television Station has also achieved a "highest," by ascending to the 6,600-meter-high Geladaindong in Qinghai Province to shoot "The First Drift on the Yangtze." This drama won the Sichuan Television Station its first international award—the "Outstanding Historical Creation Award" at the 1988 Chicago International Television and Film Festival.

The Sichuan Television Station is one of the earliest provincial-level stations to produce television dramas. Its first television drama was the children's drama "Song from the Sky." Over the years, all the children's dramas it has produced have won awards. At a time when entertainment programs are popular, the Sichuan Television Station has an ambitious plan to shoot a series of Chinese modern literature television drama libraries. The completed works in this series include Ba Jin's "Family, Spring, Autumn" (co-produced with Shanghai Television Station), Li Jioren's "Dead Water Ripples," and Su Xiaokang's "Sacred Sorrows." Upcoming productions include Ai Wu's "Journey to the South," Jia Pingwa's "Restlessness," and a musical art film "Wujiang Affection" based on the essays of Shen Congwen.

Don't always say that Sichuan people have a "basin mentality"; this "basin" is changing.

　　盆地里的电视台
    马小弥
    四川电视台的视线越出了四川盆地，把摄像机的镜头对着中国和世界，使电视剧题材的范围不断拓展。
    四川电视台创造了好几个“最”：最先在海外实地拍摄，电视剧《蒙巴萨之恋》今年获“飞天奖”单本剧提名；最早派人去南极，去年１１月又派有金乃千参加的剧组随科学考察队去南极拍摄电视连续剧《长城向南延伸》。
    除了最冷的南极和最热的非洲，四川电视台还有个“最高”，就是登上青海省海拔６６００米的各拉丹东，拍了《长江第一飘》。这个剧为川台首次赢得国际大奖——１９８８年美国芝加哥电视电影节的“历史题材优秀创作奖”。
    四川电视台是较早开展电视剧的省级台。第一部电视剧拍的是儿童剧《天上的歌》。几年来拍的儿童剧全部获奖。在娱乐片看好的今天，四川台却有一套拍摄中国现代文学电视剧文库的雄心勃勃的计划。这套文库已完成的有巴金的《家·春·秋》（与上海台合拍），李劼人的《死水微澜》、苏晓康的《神圣忧思录》等；将要拍摄的有艾芜的《南行记》、贾平凹的《浮躁》和以沈从文的散文为意境的音乐艺术片《乌江情》。
    别老说四川人有“盆地意识”了，这个“盆”在变。
