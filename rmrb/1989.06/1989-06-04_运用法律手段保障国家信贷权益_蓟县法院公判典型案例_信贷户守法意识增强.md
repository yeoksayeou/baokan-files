Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 4th.

The Jixian People's Court in Tianjin has been using legal means to protect the legitimate rights of national credit funds.

In recent years, as agricultural credit has increased, disputes related to credit have also risen. By the end of last year, the banks and credit departments in Jixian County had lent out over 450 million yuan, with overdue loans amounting to 100 million yuan. The amount of risky loans reached 24.57 million yuan, and there were over 900 disputes due to overdue loans and other issues.

The Jixian People's Court has dispatched judicial personnel to expand the scope of case acceptance in accordance with the law. They have chosen typical cases with large amounts, long delays, and significant impacts for public trials on-site. Additionally, based on the plaintiff's application, they have legally frozen the defendant's accounts and sealed their assets, providing conditions for the smooth execution of judgments.

At the same time, the Jixian People's Court has collaborated with credit departments to provide legal services. They have conducted public trials in areas with concentrated credit disputes, such as Chengguan and Guanzhuang Towns, and held discussions with representatives of township enterprises and individual business owners to enhance the legal awareness of credit users.

It is reported that within just 10 days after the public trials, the credit departments recovered overdue loans totaling more than 500,000 yuan and signed agreements to repay loans amounting to over 8 million yuan. Many "defaulting accounts" and "hard-to-collect cases" have also voluntarily made repayment plans with the credit departments to clear their loans.

In Chengguan Town, a credit user owed the Chengguan Credit Cooperative 370,000 yuan. The day after the public trial was held, this credit user voluntarily repaid 100,000 yuan, and the remaining debt was also agreed upon with the credit cooperative for repayment.

　　运用法律手段保障国家信贷权益
    蓟县法院公判典型案例
    信贷户守法意识增强
    新华社天津６月４日电（通讯员索世宁）天津蓟县人民法院运用法律手段保障国家信贷资金的合法权益。
    近几年来，农村信贷额加大，信贷方面的纠纷不断增加。截至去年末，天津蓟县银行、信贷部门共贷出４．５亿多元，逾期拖欠额达１亿元，风险贷款额度达２４５７万元，因贷款到期不还，无故拖延等形成的纠纷有９００多件。
    天津蓟县人民法院为此派出审判人员，依法扩大收案范围，并选择数额大，拖延时间久，影响坏的典型案件进行就地公开审判，他们还根据原告的申请，依法冻结被告帐户，查封财产，为判决顺利执行提供了条件。
    与此同时，蓟县人民法院还配合信贷部门做好执法服务，先后在信贷纠纷较为集中的城关、官庄等乡进行公开宣判，并召集乡镇企业和个体户代表座谈，提高了贷信户的守法意识。
    据悉，仅公判后１０天时间，信贷部门就收还久欠贷款５０多万元，签定落实偿还贷款计划８００多万元。一些“赖帐户”、“钉子户”也纷纷与信贷部门制定还贷计划，自愿清偿贷款。
    蓟县城关一家信贷户拖欠城关信用社贷款３．７万元。在召开公判会之后次日，这家信贷户就主动偿还贷款１万元，余下欠款也与信用社签订了还款计划。
