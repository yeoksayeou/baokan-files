Central Military Commission Deputy Secretary-General Hong Xuezhi, Liu Huaqing, and Minister of National Defense Qin Jiwei visited troops carrying out martial law yesterday and today. They represented Military Commission Chairman Deng Xiaoping and Vice Chairman Yang Shangkun in expressing their concern and greetings to the martial law troops. They encouraged everyone to make new contributions to stopping the turmoil and maintaining the normal order of the capital.

Hong Xuezhi, Liu Huaqing, Qin Jiwei, and other leaders went deep into the troops' temporary tents, had heart-to-heart talks with officers and soldiers, and carefully understood the officers' and soldiers' duty, study, living, and ideological situations. They also went to the field kitchen to inquire about the officers' and soldiers' meals. They highly praised the martial law troops' high political awareness and excellent style of being decisive, hardworking, disciplined, and loving the people. Today, Qin Jiwei told the officers and soldiers of a certain unit, "You came to Beijing, the capital, to carry out martial law as ordered by the Central Military Commission. In the past ten days, you have overcome numerous difficulties and done a lot of beneficial work. You love the capital, the people of the capital, and the young students. With your actual actions, you have won the understanding, support, and trust of the people of the capital. The facts have once again proven that the People's Liberation Army is a military that serves the people wholeheartedly. We come from the people, for the people. Our troops listen to the Party, have high political awareness, and can withstand any test. Carrying out martial law tasks is highly political and demanding. I hope comrades will firmly complete the glorious mission entrusted by the Party and the people." Yesterday, Hong Xuezhi, when visiting the officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region carrying out martial law, said, "You have played an important role in maintaining the order of the capital and stopping the turmoil." He pointed out that the purpose of a few people causing turmoil is to negate the Party's leadership and the socialist system. This is absolutely not allowed. Liu Huaqing, in talking with the officers and soldiers, said, "During your advance, you were obstructed, and many officers and soldiers were injured by lawless elements. You have withstood the test and performed well. You have exposed the lies of a few people with malicious intentions with your exemplary actions and won the understanding and support of the broad masses. He encouraged the officers and soldiers to seriously study the important speeches of the central leaders, further raise their awareness, strictly observe discipline, actively propagate to the masses, and complete the martial law task perfectly.

Accompanying Qin Jiwei to visit the martial law troops were also Deputy Chief of the General Staff Xu Xin.

New China News Agency, Beijing, June 3rd: Central Military Commission Discipline Inspection Commission Secretary and Deputy Director of the General Political Department Guo Linxiang recently represented the General Political Department and the leadership and staff of the Military Commission Discipline Inspection Commission to visit the officers and soldiers of a certain unit carrying out martial law.

Guo Linxiang went to the troops' camp, went deep into the troops' temporary warehouses and basements, and had heart-to-heart talks with officers and soldiers. He praised the martial law troops for resolutely executing the decisions of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the orders of the Central Military Commission, as well as their spirit of strictly observing discipline and enduring hardships. He hoped that all officers and soldiers would carry forward the fine traditions and style of our army, fully play the role of our army as both a fighting force and a working force, strictly execute policies and disciplines, do a good job of propaganda among the surrounding masses, and complete the martial law task, making contributions to stopping the turmoil and maintaining the social order of the capital.
