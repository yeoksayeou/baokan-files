	They for Why They Resigned
		Luo Pan Wang Jinchang

		“I quit!” Yuan Meisheng slammed his resignation letter on the table and walked out. The party branch secretary and general manager of Dongwen Magnetic Tape Audio Company in Dongguan, Guangdong, Fang Chi, fell into deep thought. Yuan Meisheng was the fifteenth party member and cadre to resign. These people, who had been tilling the fields barefoot yesterday, had overnight followed him to set up a farmers' enterprise, some as workshop directors, others as factory managers or deputy managers. Neither their positions nor their monthly salaries of several hundred yuan could retain them. Why?

		Fang Chi conducted an investigation and found that the resignation of workshop director Tang Jinhui was due to his inability to adapt to the factory's fast pace. The resignation of Tang Haokun, the person in charge of the handbag factory, was because a batch of goods was delivered a day late and was returned by the customer, leading to criticism from the company. The recently resigned Yuan Meisheng was because the audio tapes he was responsible for producing had quality issues and were criticized by the customer, which he couldn't swallow. These farmers, accustomed to a pastoral, leisurely life, found the fast pace of modern life both unfamiliar and bewildering, and they felt powerless and struggled to adapt.

		Fang Chi convened a party branch meeting. At the meeting, he said only one sentence: “Retreating is for cowards! Anyone who wants to be a coward, I will not retain!” He then asked these former farmers to discuss. Everyone realized that to adapt to modern enterprise management, the key was to improve political and professional qualifications. The factory then hired three professors from Shandong University to start a technical training class. Despite financial difficulties, the company sent nearly a hundred people to Dongguan City and Guangzhou for training. A comrade studying abroad whose wife fell ill wrote to her: “You are sick, go to the hospital to treat it! I am also treating the ‘disease’ in my body, and I cannot leave!” The party branch also decided to keep the goods returned by the customer and place them where all employees could see them at any time, using this to educate everyone.

		After more than a year of rigorous training, a batch of middle-level cadres began to adapt to the requirements of modern enterprises. Seventy percent of the middle-level cadres passed the self-study exams and obtained university diplomas. Yuan Meisheng, who once wanted to resign and return home, became the factory manager of the audio tape factory and introduced modern management into the enterprise. Without increasing equipment or personnel, the factory not only improved product quality but also increased monthly production by tenfold. Fang Chi sighed, “From farmers to modern entrepreneurs, the improvement of personal qualities is the most crucial.”

　　他们为何辞职
    罗盘　王锦昌
    “我不干了！”袁美胜把辞职书往桌上一放，转身就走。广东东莞市东文磁带音响有限公司党支部书记、总经理樊池陷入了沉思。袁美胜已经是第十五个提出辞职的党员干部了。这些昨天还在赤脚犁田的农民，一夜间跟着他扯起大旗创办农民企业，或当车间主任，或当厂长、副厂长，职位和每月几百元的工资，都未能吸引住他们。这是为什么？
    樊池调查发现，车间主任唐锦辉的辞职，是不适应工厂的紧张节奏。手袋厂负责人唐浩坤的辞职，是因为一批货的交货时间晚了一天，硬被人家退了回来，受到公司的批评。刚递辞职书的袁美胜，是因为他负责生产的录音带出了质量问题，受到了客户的批评，咽不下这口气。这些过惯了牧歌式悠闲生活的农民们，对现代生活的快节奏，既陌生而又惶惑，既力不从心而又难以适从。
    樊池召开了党支部会议。会上，他只说了一句：“退下去就是孬种！谁愿意当孬种，我决不挽留！”随后，他要求这些昔日的农民们讨论。大家清醒地认识到，要适应现代企业的管理，关键在于提高人的政治、业务素质。于是，厂里从山东大学聘了三名教授，开办了技术培训班。在资金困难的情况下，公司出钱选送了近百人到东莞市和广州等地学习。有位正在外地学习同志的妻子生病了，他获知后，给妻子写信说：“你病了，住院去治吧！我也在治身上的‘病’，无法脱身！”党支部还决定把被客户退回的货压下来，放在全厂职工都能随时看到的地方，以此教育大家。
    经过一年多的严格训练，一批中层干部开始适应现代企业的要求，百分之七十的中层干部通过自学考试，获得了大学文凭。一度想辞职回家的袁美胜，担任录音带厂厂长后，把现代化管理纳入企业，工厂在设备人员没有增加的情况下，不仅提高了产品质量，而且月产量也增加了十倍。对此，樊池感慨地说：“从农民到现代企业家，人的素质的提高是最关键的。”
