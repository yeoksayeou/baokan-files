Transfer – A Choice for the Century

By Chen Hua and Hu Yueping, reporters for People’s Daily

Summary: The exodus of Chinese farmers from their rural homes is a result of rural reforms. The influx of migrant workers has brought about numerous issues, making it a complex social system that requires new order to be established through deepening reforms.

Leaving the Yellow Earth

Sixteen-year-old Jiang Qiaohua left her hometown in Sichuan’s Lin Shui County, Guanghe Township, to work as a domestic helper in Chongqing at the end of last year.

“Who doesn’t want to go to Guangdong? I returned home late for the Spring Festival, and everyone else had already bought their train and boat tickets. The girls in the village all want to go, and some even gave gifts to the labor contractors to beg them to take them along!” Jiang Qiaohua’s eyes, still filled with youthful innocence, sparkled with envy and a hint of regret. She told us that her elder brother and sister are both working elsewhere, and this year, on the second and third days of the Lunar New Year, 300 girls from the village followed the labor contractors to Guangzhou to work in a knitting factory, earning over 300 yuan a month.

With the same dreams and hopes as Jiang Qiaohua, farmers from Sichuan, Hunan, Guizhou, and other provinces across the country have begun their quest for a better life.

Initially, this quest was quiet. However, with the sudden contraction of basic construction this year, the true scale of the migrant worker tide became apparent, revealing a massive influx of rural workers into cities.

The agrarian nature of Chinese society has historically meant that people who rely on farming have lived in the same place for generations. Migration has been the exception. As time passes, when the large-scale migration of farmers towards cities occurred in the 1980s, what did this signify?

In early spring of 1987, Zhenning County in Guizhou organized the first group of 300 women to work in Panyu, Guangdong. These girls, who had grown up in the mountains, initially found the city’s way of life surprising and exciting. However, they soon discovered that they were not adapted to urban living. The differences in culture, lifestyle, and pace between the inland and coastal regions were vast, leading many to feel disillusioned. Within two months, nearly one-third of the girls returned to their mountain homes.

Those who persevered in Panyu County learned through hard work and dedication. Not only did they establish roots, but they also brought over 1,000 more girls from their hometown of Zhenning. They saw working outside as a way to enter the commodity economy, learning skills and management with the goal of returning home to start their own factories.

Today, in Guangdong’s Panyu Yuhua Paper Mill, a group of young women dressed like city dwellers, who have left the yellow earth behind, hum popular songs as they work.

Sichuan, the most populous province, has long felt the pressure of its growing population on the land. With 106 million people and less than 0.9 acres of arable land per person, the implementation of the responsibility system has left 46 million laborers with surplus labor. More alarmingly, the amount of arable land is decreasing rapidly. From 1957 to 1987, over 30 years, Sichuan’s arable land decreased by 20.19 million acres.

Perhaps driven by the sharp conflict between people and land, Sichuan views the export of rural labor as a “historic labor transition.” By the end of 1987, the province had 2.3 million people organized and spontaneously leaving the province for work. The once isolated and backward Guizhou Province has also sent out approximately 70,000 people in the past two years. Hunan is not far behind, with 350,000 organized workers leaving the province in 1987 after the provincial governor’s visit to Guangdong, where he was deeply impressed by the labor export industry, which he described as a “smokeless industry,” advocating for more channels to be opened.

The gate of regional mobility has suddenly opened, and the speed of flow is fast. However, compared to the vast number of surplus laborers eager to transfer, it is like a race between a tortoise and a hare. The Chinese Academy of Sciences’ National Conditions Analysis Research Group estimates that by the turn of the century, the potential unemployed population in rural areas will be between 300 and 350 million. Whether rural surplus labor can be transferred is not only a necessary choice for modernization but also a choice for the survival and development of the nation.

In the face of a severe challenge

No one expected the challenge to come so suddenly and with such momentum. The social system trembled as a million migrant workers surged into the cities, immediately presenting the challenge of transfer.

The railways are groaning. Grain prices are soaring. Social order is threatened. In the first quarter of this year, 78.2% of all cases in Shenzhen were committed by outsiders.

According to statistics from Guangdong Province’s Labor Service Company, there are already 850,000 organized farmers working in Guangdong, and the number of spontaneous migrants is even higher.

Baoan County is at a loss over the marriage and dating issues of its “country of women.” Baoan County has a local population of 270,000 and 500,000 outsiders, including 300,000 female workers. Some young women from poor, remote mountain areas are unwilling to return home to find partners. Initially, the plan was to let them return home to find partners and then find ways to bring their spouses to work, killing two birds with one stone. However, upon closer examination, adding one female worker, her spouse, and children would result in an increase of hundreds of thousands of people in this small area within a few years, which is clearly not feasible. However, if they are sent back, Baoan will miss them. What should be done?

Guizhou, in its efforts to export labor, has deeply felt that this is an effective poverty alleviation measure. In recent years, it has exported a significant number of migrant workers to other provinces. People in Guiyang feel both the convenience brought by the “Sichuan Army” in their daily lives—they do the dirty, hard, and bitter work—and the hidden worries of management, wanting to send them back.

People have felt both the benefits and drawbacks of migrant workers in their lives and have seen that there is no “third space” for mobility between cities and villages. When cities lack basic infrastructure, when the existing industrial structure rejects intensive labor and determines that migrant workers can only do odd jobs in enterprises, and when the original city management system, adapted to static management, lacks reflection on mobility, once mobility starts, it falls into disorder.

When there was no mobility, almost everyone said mobility was beneficial. However, when mobility actually arrived, the whole society was seriously unprepared, and thus feared mobility. A theorist believes that this “Yǒu Gōng Hǎo Lóng” (a metaphor for someone who admires something they have never seen) mentality hinders our proactive adaptation to mobility.

In the Guizhou Provincial Labor Bureau, the head of the Labor Export Management Office, Wu Ke Rong, told us that the migrant worker tide has already subsided in various places, but the problems are not as some people think, already resolved.

The migrant worker tide calls for reform

The challenges brought by mobility are thought-provoking.

The several million people flowing into Guangdong consume about 750 million kilograms of grain annually, in addition to local consumption, leaving a shortage of over 40 billion kilograms. Neighboring Hunan Province has seen its agriculture stagnate since 1984, while its population has increased by the equivalent of an entire county each year. The province can only support 1.5 to 2 billion kilograms of grain for mobility annually.

The faster the mobility, the more severe the grain shortage. Behind a vast migrant worker tide is a fragile agriculture. “The inability to transfer rural labor is one of the hidden dangers in current agriculture.” Professor He Botian of Zhongshan University believes: “In the transfer of surplus labor, if China’s agriculture does not pass the test, there will be no way out. The great development of agriculture is related to future realistic choices.”

The urban system, after experiencing the impact of the migrant worker tide, also faces the choice of reform. For example, in the labor employment system, we saw the following phenomenon in a towel factory in Guiyang: various technical positions in the machine repair workshop were almost entirely replaced by temporary workers from other provinces, and a considerable number of track workers in other workshops were also from rural areas in other provinces. Meanwhile, the idle formal workers still held their “iron rice bowls.” Economists call this phenomenon “structural unemployment.” It is estimated that there are currently 15 to 20 million hidden unemployed workers nationwide, while there are 30 million vacant positions. This structural unemployment reflects the lack of reasonable mobility in cities and enterprises. Scholars have discussed their views on this:

Lu Xiaopeng (Director of the China Cooperative Economics Society): Our current employment system is still “two identities,” and the rules are different. If we do not break through, there may be many jobs left undone in the future.

Zhou Qiren (Deputy Researcher, State Council Rural Development Research Center): We should seek development in mobility, turning the migrant worker force into a positive force for reforming the original public ownership labor system and employment system, maintaining appropriate pressure. Without this pressure, there will be no reform. We need to reduce the number of permanent workers and expand the number of contract workers, including optimizing the labor combination. This cannot be shaken.

As a “reservoir” for rural labor, township enterprises are currently one of the ways to transfer rural labor. However, facing the vast labor force, the “reservoir” seems too small. Taking Guizhou as an example, by 1987, township enterprises had developed to 406,000, with 1.16 million employees, but the absorption capacity only accounts for 1/10 of the total rural labor force in the province.

Zhou Qiren reflected on the process of rural labor transfer over the past 10 years, believing that the migrant worker tide is closely related to our policy foresight: “China’s rural absorption system is limited. Every village sets up factories, which in itself brings many problems. The slogan ‘leaving the land but not the village’ later proved to be limited. Later, attention was paid to urbanization and mobility, but when farmers began to move in large numbers, there were no corresponding countermeasures.” He believes that the scale of this transfer and the disorder are beyond our expectations. When the migrant worker tide sweeps in, it is inevitable to be at a loss. This shows that we lack policy foresight.

A theorist further analyzed the migrant worker tide using the “resonance phenomenon” in physics. On the one hand, allowing farmers to move, on the other hand, trying to clear them out of the city, pushing from one side and cutting from the other, these two measures combined can easily lead to conflicting resonance. Once this phenomenon forms, it is very dangerous.

Theorists call for: The problems arising from the transfer of rural labor are a complex social system project and should be reflected comprehensively. We need to change the original system, concepts, and thinking methods, getting out of the habit of “cutting when too many, driving away when too few.” Reform itself is a change, and we need to learn to seek development in change and establish a new order in change.

The choice of Chinese farmers leaving the yellow earth for the century depends on whether we can create more opportunities in the future.

　　转移——跨世纪的选择
    本报记者  陈华  胡跃平
    提要：中国农民走出黄土地是农村改革的结果。民工潮引发出诸多问题，是一个复杂的社会系统工程，应该在深化改革中建立新秩序
    走出黄土地
    １６岁的姜桥花是去年底离开自己的家乡——四川邻水县光和乡来到重庆当保姆的。
    “哪个不想去广东？我春节回家晚了，人家都买好车船票走了。村里的女娃儿都想去，有的还给包工头送礼求着带出去呢！”姜桥花说到这里，那充满稚气的眼中扑闪着羡慕，也夹杂着几分遗憾。她告诉我们，二哥和姐姐都在外地做工，村里的３００多个女孩子今年正月初二、三就跟着包工头去广州了，说是去打毛线，一个月能挣３００多块。
    带着与姜桥花一样的梦想，一样的希望，来自四川、湖南、贵州……来自全国各地的农民，先后开始了他们的寻梦。
    起初，寻梦悄悄地进行着。基本建设规模今年陡然压缩，这才水落石出，人们看到城市里涌动着蔚为壮观的民工潮。
    中国社会的乡土性，决定了以农为生的人们，世代定居是常态，迁移则是变态。时光流转，当８０年代中国大地上农民面向城市的大流动发生时，这意味着什么？
    １９８７年初春，贵州的正安县首次组织了一支３００人的娘子军远征广东番禺。生于山沟，长于山沟的姑娘们，在经历了最初的惊奇、兴奋之后，发现自己并不适应城里的生活方式，观念、文化、节奏的快慢与沿海差异甚大，不少人产生了挫折感，不到两个月，就有近１／３的姑娘又回到山沟。
    在番禺县坚持下来的正安姑娘们，通过两年多的勤劳进取，不仅扎了根，还从家乡正安引来了１０００多名姑娘。她们把外出劳务看成进入商品经济的大学校，她们学技术，学管理，想着将来回到家乡办工厂。
    如今，在广东番禺越华造纸厂，一群衣着打扮与城里人无别、走出黄土地的务工姑娘，嘴里哼唱的都是流行歌曲。
    人口最多的四川省，早已感到膨胀的人口对土地的压力。１．０６亿人口，人均耕地不足０．９亩。实行责任制后，全省４６００万劳力，如按每个劳动力平均承担４．５亩计，则土地上只需２１００万劳力，其余的人成为了剩余劳动力。更令人担忧的是土地还在迅速减少，从１９５７年到１９８７年，３０年间四川耕地净减２０１９万亩。
    也许是迫于人与土地尖锐矛盾的压力，四川把农村输出看成是“一场历史性的劳动变迁”。到１９８７年底，全省有组织和自发出省从事劳务的人数已达２３０万。“川军入黔黔军动”，一向闭塞落后的贵州省这两年也输出了约７万人。湖南也不甘人后，１９８７年该省省长考察广东后感受最深的就是劳动输出是无烟工业，要广辟渠道，去年这个省有组织输出的劳力达３５万多人。
    骤然开启地域流动的闸门，流速是很快的，然而与急待转移的庞大劳动力数量相比，却又如同龟兔赛跑。中科院国情分析研究小组测算，下世纪初，农村潜在失业人口大体在３—３．５亿之间。能否实现农村剩余劳动力的转移，已不仅是现代化的必然选择，更是民族生存和发展的选择。
    在严峻的挑战面前
    谁也不曾料到挑战的来临几乎是转瞬间的，而且势头迅猛。百万民工引发的社会系统性颤动，一下子就把转移的挑战摆到了人们的面前。
    铁路在呻吟。粮价在暴涨。社会治安受到威胁。深圳今年一季度外来人员作案占全市总发案数的７８．２％。
    据广东省劳动服务公司统计，目前有组织来广东做工的农民已达８５万人，加上自发来的，数字还要翻番。
    宝安县却在为“女儿国”的婚恋问题一筹莫展。宝安县本地人口２７万，外来人口５０万，其中女工３０多万，一些来自贫困、边远山区的女青年不愿再回去找对象。先前打算让她们回去找对象，然后设法将其爱人也招来做工，一举两全。可一算细帐，一个女工再加上她的爱人、孩子，不要几年，宝安这弹丸之地得增加上百万人口，这显然不行。让她们回去吧，宝安少不了她们，这事怎么办？
    贵州在抓劳务输出中，深深感到这是一条扶贫的有效途径，这些年向省外输出了不少的民工。贵阳人一方面感到川军来后带来的生活上的便利，脏、累、活苦川军干；另一方面，又抱怨着管理是个隐忧，要把川军赶回去。
    人们都从生活中感受到了民工到来后的利与弊，也看到了城市和乡村之间并没有一个流动的“第三空间”，当城市缺乏基础设施，当现有的产业结构排斥密集型劳动而注定民工在企业只能拾遗补缺，当原有适应静态管理的城市体制缺乏对流动的反映时，流动一旦启动，便陷入无序。
    不流动的时候，几乎所有人都说流动有好处，而当流动真的到来，全社会都对此严重准备不足，于是又恐惧流动。一位理论工作者认为，这种“叶公好龙”的心态阻碍了我们去主动适应流动。
    在贵州省劳动局，劳务输出管理处负责人吴克容告诉我们，民工潮已在各地初落，但问题并不像一些人想的已平安无事。不能认为靠行政手段把民工清退，便万事大吉了。
    民工潮呼唤改革
    流动带来的挑战令人深思。
    流入广东的几百万人每年要消耗议价粮约７．５亿公斤，加上当地自身的消费，缺口４０多亿公斤。邻省湖南，１９８４年起农业持续徘徊，人口却以每年等于多一个大县的速度增长，全省每年能支持流动的粮食仅１．５至２亿公斤。
    流动速度越快，粮食短缺越严重，在一个浩荡的民工潮背后却是一个脆弱的农业。“农村劳动力无法转移是当前农业存在的隐患之一”。中山大学副教授何博传认为：“在剩余劳动力的转移上，如果中国的农业不过关，是绝对不会有出路的。农业的大发展，关系到未来的现实选择。”
    经历了民工潮冲击的城市体制也面临着改革的选择。如在劳动就业制度方面，我们在贵阳一家毛巾厂看到这样的现象：机修车间里一向吃得开的各种技术工种，几乎全部由外省来的临时工替代了，其他车间的挡车工也有相当部分是外地来的农村姑娘。而那些一旁闲着的正式职工照样捧着铁饭碗。经济学家称此现象为“结构性失业”。据测算，全国目前有１５００至２０００万人的在职失业队伍（隐蔽性失业），同时全国有３０００万个岗位工种空缺。这种结构性失业反映出城市、企业缺乏合理流动。理论界人士就此谈了他们的看法——
    罗小朋（中国合作经济学会理事）：我们现在在用工制度上实际还是“两种身份”，不同的身份规则也不一样，如不突破，将来可能还会有很多活没人干。
    周其仁（国务院农村发展研究中心副研究员）：应该在流动中求发展，把农民工这个力量转化为改革原有的全民所有制劳动制度、就业制度的一种积极力量，保持一种适当的压力，没有这个压力，他不会改革，要减少固定工，扩大合同工，包括优化劳动组合。这不能动摇。
    作为“蓄水池”的乡镇企业，是目前找到的农村劳动力转移的途径之一。但是，面对庞大的劳动大军，“蓄水池”的容量却显得太小了。以贵州为例，到１９８７年乡镇企业已发展到４０．６万个，从业人员１１６万人，而吸纳量只占全省农村总劳动力的１／１０。
    周其仁反思这１０年来农村劳动力转移过程，认为民工潮与我们政策的预见性有很大关联：“中国农村的吸收系统是有限的，每个村都办工厂，这本身就带来很大问题。‘离土不离乡’的口号后来证明是有局限性的。以后又注意到城市化，注意到流动，但是当农民开始大批地流动时，却没有拿出相应的对策来”。他认为，这次转移规模之大，以及转移之无序，都是我们始料不及的。当民工浪潮席卷而来时，难免束手无策。说明我们还缺乏政策预见性。
    一位理论工作者用物理学中的“共振现象”对民工潮作了进一步分析。一方面允许农民流动，一方面又要把他们清理出城，这头推，那头砍，两种措施一配合，很容易出现冲突性的共振，这种现象一旦形成是很危险的。
    理论工作者们呼吁：农村劳动力转移过程中引发出诸多问题，是一个复杂的社会系统工程，应作一种综合的反映。我们要改变原有的体制、观念和思维方法，从过去那种习惯于“少了赶，多了砍”的误区中走出来。改革本身就是一场变动，我们要学会在变动中求发展，在变动中建立新的秩序。
    中国农民走出黄土地这一跨世纪的选择取决于我们未来能否创造更多的机会。
    民工潮呼唤着改革。
