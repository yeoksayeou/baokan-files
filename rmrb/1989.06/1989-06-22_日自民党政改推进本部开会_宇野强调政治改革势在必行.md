The Japanese Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) Political Reform Promotion Headquarters held its first meeting this morning at the LDP headquarters. Prime Minister Uno, who attended the meeting, stated in his speech that an apology to the public is necessary regarding the Recruit scandal. As the party responsible, the LDP should bear the greatest responsibility. Treatment of the symptoms is necessary, but the root of the problem lies in reforming the political system. He emphasized that political reform is imperative.

Ito Masayoshi, who took office as the director of the Political Reform Promotion Headquarters two days ago, said: "Due to the Recruit scandal, the LDP is facing an unprecedented shock. Regaining public trust is crucial. We must push forward with political reform with a determination to shed blood and sacrifice. This is not just for the Uno cabinet. If political reform fails, the LDP will have no future."

Political reform bills, which include changing the election system, eliminating factions, and reforming political funding, have not made progress in this session of the Diet. The LDP plans to continue deliberations in the extraordinary session of the Diet this autumn and aims to pass all the bills in the Diet next year.

    日自民党政改推进本部开会  宇野强调政治改革势在必行
    本报东京6月22日电  记者于青报道：日本自民党政治改革推进本部今天上午在自民党本部举行首次会议。宇野首相到会致词说，对于利库路特问题，必须向国民表示歉意。作为有责任的政党自民党，应该承担最大的责任。对症治疗是必要的，根本在于改革政治体制，强调政治改革势在必行。
    前天就任政治改革推进本部部长的伊东正义发表讲话说：“因利库路特事件，自民党面临史无前例的冲击，恢复国民信赖至关重要。要以不怕流血牺牲的觉悟推进政治改革，这不光是为了宇野内阁。如果政治改革失败，自民党就没有希望。”
    以改革选举制度、消除派系、改革政治资金收入等为主要内容的政治改革有关法案未能在本届国会上取得进展，自民党计划在秋后的临时国会上继续审议，力争在明年国会上全部通过。
