Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, June 2nd.

During the spring off-season for vegetables, it is common to hear people on public buses and in farmers' markets expressing satisfaction with the vegetable supply.

It is understood that the Chongqing market has maintained a steady supply of vegetables during the off-season this year, mainly due to different policies adopted by the municipal government. These policies include: removing the cap on losses for operating departments, with market and district-level finances covering any losses incurred during operations, thereby eliminating the concerns of operating departments; increasing and improving the procurement tasks for vegetable bases, adding four city-managed roadside vegetable varieties, ensuring that there are main varieties during the off-season; supplementing the planting of lettuce and 6,000 mu of quick-growing small white cabbage, setting corresponding protected purchase prices, and adjusting purchase prices in a timely manner according to market changes.

According to the Chongqing Municipal Second Commercial Bureau, the social supply of vegetables in the suburban eight districts this year from April to May reached 63.05 million kilograms, an increase of 9.5% compared to the same period last year. The per capita daily supply reached 474 grams.

　　重庆蔬菜市场淡季不淡
    据新华社重庆６月２日电  （记者向虎）蔬菜春淡期，在公共汽车上、农贸市场里，到处可以听到人们对淡季蔬菜供应较为满意的议论。
    据了解，重庆市场今年蔬菜供应淡季不淡，主要是市政府今年采取了不同往年的政策，其中包括：规定经营部门亏损不封顶，经营中造成的亏损由市、区两级财政负担，消除了经营部门的后顾之忧；增加和完善了蔬菜基地的订购任务，新增四个市管大路品种，保证了淡季中有主力品种压阵；补种了莴笋和６０００亩速生小白菜，制订了相应的保护收购价，同时根据市场的变化，及时调整收购价格。
    据重庆市二商局介绍，今年四五月市郊八区蔬菜社会上市量达６３０５万公斤，比去年同期增加９．５％，人均日供应量达４７４克。
