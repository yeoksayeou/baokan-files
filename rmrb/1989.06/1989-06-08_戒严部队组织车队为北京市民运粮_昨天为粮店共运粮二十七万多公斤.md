Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 8th.

Today, in the afternoon, many streets in Beijing saw convoys with red banners reading "PLA Transporting Grain for the People." These convoys were organized by the martial law troops to help address the urgent needs of Beijing residents.

Due to recent traffic disruptions in Beijing, some grain stores were facing shortages. Upon learning this, the martial law troops' command proactively requested tasks from the municipal government, organized convoys, and helped transport grain. Today, the martial law troops selected the best vehicles and drivers, with officers leading the teams and armed soldiers escorting the convoys. A total of 69 vehicles and over 500 troops formed 15 convoys, transporting 276,000 kilograms of grain to various grain stores.

Workers at the grain depots and stores welcomed the martial law troops' grain transport efforts. Seeing the convoys, they applauded enthusiastically. A worker from one of the depots said, "We haven't been able to distribute grain for four days, and the people of the entire city are anxious, as are we. Now that you've come to help transport the grain, we can rest easy." Many workers offered the transporting soldiers drinks, tomatoes, and cucumbers as tokens of gratitude. They also mentioned that during the martial law troops' execution of duties and legal punishment of counter-revolutionary rioters, some civilians were inadvertently injured. They noted that some people might not understand this immediately, but they would eventually.

The martial law troops expressed that transporting grain for the people is their duty, and they will continue to serve the people through their actions.

The martial law troops' command stated that today was just the first effort, and they will continue to organize convoys to transport grain for the residents of the capital in the future.

　　戒严部队组织车队为北京市民运粮
    昨天为粮店共运粮二十七万多公斤
    新华社北京６月８日电  戒严部队指挥部新闻处消息：今天下午开始，北京市许多街头出现了一个个悬挂“解放军为民运粮”红幅的车队。这是戒严部队为帮助解决北京人民生活急需组织的运粮车队。
    由于近期北京市内交通受阻，一些粮店存粮紧张，戒严部队指挥部获悉后，主动向市政府请求任务，组织车队，帮助运粮。今天，戒严部队挑好车、好驾驶员，由干部带队武装押车，并组织出动了６９台车，５００余名官兵，组成了１５个车队，为粮店共运粮２７．６万公斤。
    粮库、粮店职工对戒严部队派车为市民运粮表示欢迎，看到车队，纷纷鼓掌。一粮库职工高兴地说：“我们四天发不出粮食，全市人民很着急，我们也着急。你们来帮助把粮运出去，我们就放心了。”许多职工给运粮官兵送汽水、西红柿、黄瓜等，表示感谢。他们还说，戒严部队执行任务和依法惩处反革命暴徒的过程中，误伤了一些群众，有些人一时思想弯子转不过来，慢慢会转过来的。
    戒严部队官兵表示，为民运粮是我们应该做的，我们要不断用实际行动，更好地为人民服务。
    戒严部队指挥部介绍，今天仅仅是第一次，以后还要继续组织车队为首都市民运粮。
