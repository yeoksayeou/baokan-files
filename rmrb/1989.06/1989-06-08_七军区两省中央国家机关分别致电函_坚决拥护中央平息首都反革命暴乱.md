The Party Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army received telegrams from the Party Committees of the Beijing, Shenyang, Jinan, Nanjing, Guangzhou, Chengdu, and Lanzhou Military Regions expressing their firm support for the decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital.

Beijing Military Region
To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission:

The "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council has given us profound education and greatly boosted the morale of the troops. Over the past month, the Party Committee, the headquarters, and all the officers and soldiers executing the martial law mission in the Beijing Military Region have personally witnessed the turmoil deliberately created by a few malicious individuals in the capital and have actually seen numerous facts of the turmoil developing into a counter-revolutionary rebellion, which has aroused our deep indignation. We unanimously express our firm support for the wise decision and decisive measures of the Party Central Committee.

The martial law troops in our region will definitely implement the instructions and regulations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission. We will distinguish between the two different types of contradictions, strictly separating the broad masses of the people and the youth students from the few counter-revolutionary rebels. We will resolutely strike down the few ruthless counter-revolutionary rebels and protect the broad masses of the people and the youth students. We will continue to carry out education in the army on "loving the capital, loving the people of the capital, and loving the youth students," wholeheartedly safeguarding the fundamental interests of the people, and displaying the good image of our army as a "powerful and civilized force."

The struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion is complex and arduous. We are determined to closely unite around the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, and work closely with brother units, the People's Armed Police, and public security officers. With the strong support of the Party and government at all levels in the capital and the broad masses of the people, we will resolutely and thoroughly suppress this counter-revolutionary rebellion, make our due contributions to defending the Party Central Committee and the People's Republic of Socialism, and will not retreat until we achieve complete victory.

Shenyang Military Region
To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Military Commission:

Since June 4, the Party Committee, the standing committee, the headquarters, and all subordinate units in our military region have repeatedly and seriously studied the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, as well as the June 4 editorial of the "Liberation Army Daily." Everyone believes that at this critical moment concerning the fate of the Party and the country, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission made the timely and necessary decision to resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, which represents the fundamental interests of the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country. We firmly support the major decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, and fully support the decisive actions of the martial law troops to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion. We strongly condemn the crimes of the few individuals who created the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

Everyone listed the heinous crimes of a handful of rioters attacking the key departments of the Party and the state, wantonly beating, smashing, looting, burning, and killing, and harming our soldiers in one shocking incident after another, which aroused great indignation. Comrades said that the facts show that this is an organized and premeditated attack on the Party, a shocking and extremely serious counter-revolutionary rebellion, whose purpose is to overthrow the Communist Party and the government of the People's Republic and replace it with an illegal political organization of counter-revolutionaries. If timely and decisive measures are not taken, the People's Republic, for which tens of millions of martyrs sacrificed their lives and blood, will be destroyed, and the entire Chinese nation will fall into the darkness of rule. Therefore, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission took decisive measures to quickly suppress this rebellion, which is a just action to defend the great Communist Party of China, defend the People's Republic of China, defend the sacred Constitution, and defend the solemn capital. All officers and soldiers in the region were greatly inspired.

Everyone clearly saw that although the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion has achieved initial success, the struggle is complex and arduous. We must take the education on suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion as the top priority, deeply study the series of instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission on stopping the counter-revolutionary rebellion, continue to condemn the serious crimes of a handful of bad people in creating the counter-revolutionary rebellion, expose and criticize counter-revolutionary political rumors, unify thoughts, firm up confidence, and maintain consistency in ideology, politics, and actions with the Party Central Committee. We must guard our posts, fulfill our duties, strengthen organizational discipline, strictly manage the troops, and maintain the high degree of concentration and unity of the troops. We must strengthen unity within and outside the military, closely rely on local governments and the broad masses of the people, expose and strike down the conspiracies and sabotage activities of a handful of bad people, and with a firm stance, effective measures, and actions, contribute to the thorough suppression of the rebellion and the maintenance of stability and unity.

Everyone expressed that we are the children of the people, forever loyal to the Party and the people. At this critical moment, we will not let down the trust of the Party and the people and will definitely complete the tasks assigned to us by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission.

Jinan Military Region
To the Office of the General Political Department:

On the morning of June 5, the standing committee of the Jinan Military Region Party Committee seriously listened to the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, studied the June 4 editorial of the "Liberation Army Daily" and the broadcast speech of Mayor Chen Xitong of Beijing. Everyone unanimously supported the wise decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, expressed great indignation at the heinous crimes of a handful of rioters in Beijing, and expressed high respect for the heroic martial law troops, the People's Armed Police, and the public security officers who achieved great victories in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion. We also expressed our sincere condolences to the wounded soldiers and deep sorrow for the martyrs!

During the study and discussion, the committee members said that from the early morning of June 3 to the early morning of June 4, the heartless rioters used the violent acts of beating, smashing, looting, burning, and killing to completely tear off their false masks of "patriotism" and "democracy," making the essence of this rebellion, which attempted to negate the leadership of the Party, negate the socialist system, and overthrow the People's Republic, completely exposed. The shocking struggle made us even more aware of the correctness of the spirit of the "April 26" editorial of the "People's Daily" and even more aware of the correctness of the series of decisions made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission in this struggle. At this critical moment when the fate of the Party and the state is facing a serious threat, if we do not take decisive measures to resolutely suppress this counter-revolutionary rebellion, we will not only be unable to defend the peace of the capital and the dignity of the motherland, defend the leadership of the Party and the socialist system, but the lives and safety of the broad masses of the people will also be seriously threatened. In this life-and-death struggle, the People's Liberation Army fulfilled its sacred duty as stipulated by the Constitution, and together with the People's Armed Police and the public security officers, launched a counterattack against a group of counter-revolutionary villains, which is completely in line with the fundamental interests of the people of all ethnic groups in the country. Although a few rioters are still spreading rumors and creating trouble, the truth will eventually expose the lies, and justice will eventually defeat evil. Under the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, and with the support of the broad masses of the people, we will definitely achieve complete victory in this struggle. Everyone expressed that we will firmly respond to the call of the Party Central Committee, stand up, lead all the troops in the region to contribute to the suppression of the rebellion and the stabilization of the situation, and let the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission rest assured!

To ensure that all the troops in the region fulfill their duties and complete their missions, the Military Region Party Committee requires all units to:

1. Immediately organize the troops to seriously study the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, unify the thoughts of the officers and soldiers to the spirit of the Central Committee, ensure that all the troops in the region maintain high consistency with the Party Central Committee, and firmly and clearly support the decisions of the Party Central Committee.

2. Fully play the vanguard and model role of the broad Party members in the struggle. All levels of Party organizations must seriously and strictly conduct a round of education on Party nature, Party discipline, and Party consciousness for the Party members under their jurisdiction, guide everyone to consciously regulate their words and deeds according to the requirements of the Party, and stand with the Party in unity of heart and mind, take the lead in the struggle, and strive to complete all the tasks assigned by the Party and the people, and pass this severe test.

3. All levels of leadership must guard their posts, be loyal to their duties, strengthen management, strictly discipline, and maintain the concentration, unity, and stability of the troops.

4. Closely monitor social trends, calmly and prudently handle all kinds of situations that may arise. Firmly expose and strike down the provocative actions of a handful of villains and assist local governments in their actions.

5. Maintain normal war preparedness, training, work, and living order, coordinate all work, ensure the completion of the mission to stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation, and ensure the smooth progress of all work centered on military training, and contribute all our strength to achieve complete victory in this struggle.

Nanjing Military Region
To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission:

On June 4 and 5, the standing committee of the Military Region Party Committee seriously studied the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, as well as the June 4 editorial of the "Liberation Army Daily." Everyone unanimously believed that at this critical moment when the capital witnessed a shocking counter-revolutionary rebellion and the fate of the Party and the state is at stake, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission took decisive measures to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, which was very timely and correct, greatly encouraging the broad masses of the people and deterring and disintegrating a few individuals with ulterior motives. Everyone expressed firm support for the major decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission. On behalf of all the officers and soldiers in the region, we express our high respect and sincere greetings to the martial law troops who made contributions in suppressing this rebellion, and to the public security officers and the People's Armed Police!

In the counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in the capital, a few rioters incited some people who did not understand the truth to smash and burn military vehicles, loot weapons and ammunition, attack key departments of the state, and inhumanely kill soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Their actions completely trampled the Constitution, seriously threatened the safety of the lives and property of the people of the capital. This was the malignant development of a period in which a few individuals conspired to create turmoil, and the concentrated exposure of their evil intentions to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party of China, oppose the socialist system, and overthrow the People's Republic of China. Quickly suppressing this counter-revolutionary rebellion, defending the great People's Republic of China, and defending the achievements of reform and opening up, conform to the wishes and fundamental interests of the people of the whole country. If the turmoil does not stop and the rebellion is not suppressed, the people will not be at peace, the country will not be at peace, the realization of the Four Modernizations and the revitalization of China will become a bubble. We must be firm in our stance, clear in our banner, and carry this severe struggle to the end.

Although the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion has achieved the first step of victory, the situation in the capital is still very serious. We firmly believe that under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, we will definitely be able to thoroughly suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion. We must act quickly, respond to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, organize all the troops in the region to seriously study the series of important instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, sharpen our eyes, distinguish right from wrong, firm up our stance, and strengthen our confidence. In thought and action, we must maintain consistency with the Party Central Committee. Quickly do a good job in preparing for stopping the turmoil and suppressing the rebellion, firmly listen to the command of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, guard our posts, strictly discipline, fulfill our duties, and strive to complete all the tasks assigned to us. Actively strengthen contact with local Party committees and governments, actively assist local governments in doing a good job for the broad masses of workers, students, and urban residents, and maximize the isolation and strike against a few individuals who conspire to create rebellion. Fully play the role of Party and League organizations, and the model and leading role of Party members and cadres at all levels. Strive to do a good job in the war preparedness of the southeast coast, implement all war preparedness systems and measures, strengthen military-police-civilian joint defense, and be ready at any time to smash the enemy's harassment and sabotage activities. We will lead all the troops in the region to contribute to stopping the turmoil and suppressing the rebellion with high morale.

Guangzhou Military Region
To the Central Military Commission and the General Political Department:

On June 4, our martial law troops took decisive action in the face of unbearable circumstances and suppressed a serious counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in Beijing, successfully defending the great socialist motherland and its capital with blood and life, defending the people's regime. The news came, and the standing committee of the Military Region Party Committee immediately held a study and discussion. Everyone expressed great indignation at the evil deeds of a few individuals who conspired and incited some villains to create a counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital, firmly supported the wise decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission to suppress the rebellion, and expressed high respect for the martial law troops who made great contributions in this struggle.

In recent days, a handful of reactionaries who harbor deep hatred for the Party, the state, and the army have publicly proposed a counter-revolutionary program of action to "take up arms, overthrow the current government, and overthrow the Communist Party." They are closely colluding with domestic and foreign hostile forces, occupying Tiananmen Square, attacking the key departments of the Party and the state, burning buildings, looting shops, and inhumanely killing our soldiers, burning our military vehicles, looting our weapons, committing all kinds of evil deeds, and acting lawlessly, completely exposing their ugly faces of overthrowing the Communist Party and subverting the socialist system under the banner of demanding "democracy and freedom." If these counter-revolutionary rebels are not resolutely suppressed, the Party will have no peace, the country will have no peace. Suppressing this counter-revolutionary rebellion is a just action to defend the people's regime and the dignity of the Constitution, and a just action that conforms to the fundamental interests of the people of the whole country.

Our military region's troops are stationed at the southern gate of the motherland, shouldering the glorious mission of defending the security of the country's border and coast, defending the achievements of reform and opening up, and bearing the heavy responsibility of assisting local governments in maintaining social order and protecting the safety of people's lives and property. We, the Military Region Party Committee, unanimously expressed that in the face of major issues of principle, we will remain firm in our stance, clear in our banner, and as always, unite around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Military Commission, maintain the high degree of concentration and unity of the troops, and be well prepared to deal with all kinds of complex situations that may arise. We will implement all war preparedness measures and strictly prevent the enemy's sabotage and harassment from both inside and outside the country. We will ensure that at the command of the Central Military Commission, we will immediately take action to defend the motherland and defend the peaceful labor of the people. We firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, we will definitely achieve complete victory in this struggle.

Chengdu Military Region
To the Office of the General Political Department:

In recent days, we, the Party Committee, have seriously studied the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, the letter of condolence from the Three General Departments to the martial law troops, the June 4 editorial of the "Liberation Army Daily," and listened to and watched the radio and television broadcasts of the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing. We discussed the severe situation facing Beijing and deeply realized that the turmoil deliberately created by a few individuals has developed into a shocking and serious counter-revolutionary rebellion. The program, slogans, and actions of this rebellion fully show that its purpose is to fundamentally overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China, overthrow the socialist system, and subvert the People's Republic of China. If this rebellion is not suppressed, the People's Republic, for which tens of millions of martyrs sacrificed their lives and blood, may be subverted, the achievements of socialist construction and ten years of reform may be destroyed, and the country may be plunged into a white terror. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission took decisive and resolute measures to suppress this counter-revolutionary rebellion, which was very timely and correct. We firmly support the wise decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, and firmly support the revolutionary actions taken by the martial law troops. We unanimously expressed our firm belief in the leadership of the Party Central Committee, firmly obeyed the unified command of the Central Military Commission, led all the troops in the region to pass this test in this struggle, and made new contributions to the interests of the Party and the people, and defended the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, and the People's Republic of China with blood and even life.

We are determined to take the following practical actions:

1. Always grasp the unification of the thoughts of the troops with the spirit of the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Central Military Commission, educate the broad officers and soldiers to further clarify the nature of this struggle, understand the historical mission of our army, firm up their confidence, stand firm, learn from the martial law troops, fear no hardships or sacrifices, and firmly fight against the few individuals who created the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

2. Use all propaganda and public opinion tools to propagate the wise decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission to the broad masses, expose the various crimes and evil purposes of the rioters, distinguish right from wrong, inspire fighting spirit, strengthen confidence, and unite in struggle.

3. Strictly discipline, strictly manage, and ensure the normal order of learning, training, work, and life of the troops. Always be vigilant, strengthen defense, and let the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission rest assured! Let the people of the whole country rest assured!

4. All levels of leadership must be firm in their stance, clear in their banner, and lead by example in this struggle, and make new contributions to the thorough suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion and the achievement of victory.

To the Office of the General Political Department:

In recent days, the standing committee of the Military Region Party Committee has seriously studied and discussed the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, the June 4 editorial of the "Liberation Army Daily," and the letter of condolence from the Three General Departments to the martial law troops in the capital. Everyone unanimously expressed firm support for the correct decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission to resolutely suppress the serious counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in the capital, firmly responded to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, and unshakably carried out this struggle to the end, and with practical actions defended the achievements of revolution, construction, and reform.

The standing committee of the Military Region Party Committee expressed great indignation at the shocking counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in the capital, unanimously believing that the decisive and resolute measures taken by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission to stop the rebellion are the only correct choice, completely a just action, and completely in line with the common wishes and fundamental interests of the people of the capital and the people of the whole country. Only by resolutely suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion and quickly suppressing this rebellion can we thoroughly smash their evil conspiracy to overthrow the leadership of the Party, negate the socialist system, and subvert the People's Republic of China.

The standing committee of the Military Region Party Committee believed that although the situation in the capital is still very serious, we firmly believe that the Party and the government have the ability to thoroughly suppress this rebellion. They expressed that the more serious the situation, the more we must believe in the Party Central Committee, the more we must maintain consistency with the Party Central Committee, the more we must maintain the high stability and unity of the troops, and closely unite with the people of all ethnic groups to struggle for the creation of a stable and good social environment.

To further unify the thoughts and actions of the troops with the spirit of the Central Committee, and be ready at any time to complete all the tasks assigned by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, the Military Region Party Committee requires all units to arrange special time to seriously organize the officers and soldiers to study and discuss the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, the June 4 editorial of the "Liberation Army Daily," and other relevant documents and materials that expose the truth of the rebellion. Firmly refute all rumors, heighten vigilance, sharpen eyes, unite as one, and firmly fight against this group of reactionaries who harbor deep hatred for the Communist Party and the socialist system.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission received reports and letters from the provinces of Liaoning and Hebei and the central state organs expressing their firm support for the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital.

Liaoning Province
To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission:

From June 3 to 4, a shocking counter-revolutionary rebellion occurred in the capital, Beijing. The officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army martial law troops and the People's Armed Police and public security officers, with the active cooperation and support of the broad masses of the people and the youth students, resolutely suppressed this rebellion. On June 5, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council issued the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country," exposing the true facts of this rebellion, deeply pointing out the nature of this political struggle, and calling on all Communist Party members and the broad masses of the people to unite as one, resolutely crush this counter-revolutionary rebellion, and carry out reform and construction to the end. That morning, a joint meeting was held under the chairmanship of Comrade Quan Shuren, attended by the leading comrades of the Provincial Party Committee, the Provincial Advisory Committee, the Provincial People's Congress, the Provincial Government, the Provincial Political Consultative Conference, and the Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, to seriously study and discuss. Everyone unanimously believed that the counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in the capital is unprecedented since the founding of the country, is the malignant development of a period in which a few individuals conspired to create turmoil, and is the concentrated exposure of their evil intentions to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party of China, oppose the socialist system. If their conspiracy succeeds, the People's Republic, for which tens of millions of martyrs sacrificed their lives and blood, will be subverted, the achievements of socialist construction and ten years of reform will be destroyed, and a very promising China will become a China without hope. Everyone expressed firm support for the major decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Everyone pointed out that this major decision is to defend the sacred Constitution of our country, stabilize social order, and maintain a stable and united situation, which is in line with the hearts of the Party and the people, in line with the fundamental interests of the people of the whole country, and is very necessary and completely correct. We express our high respect and sincere greetings to the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army martial law troops, the People's Armed Police, and the broad public security officers who made outstanding contributions in suppressing this rebellion.

To respond to the call of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, and stabilize the situation in Liaoning, we have taken the following measures:

1. Immediately organize the broad Party members, League members, cadres, and workers to seriously study the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, guide everyone to deeply understand the nature of this counter-revolutionary rebellion, deeply understand the great significance of the decisive measures taken by the Party Central Committee to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion. On the afternoon of June 5, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government issued the "Notice on Seriously Studying the 'Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country' Issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council," requiring all Party members, League members, and state organ workers in the province to firmly believe in the correct decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, firmly maintain political consistency with the Party Central Committee, firmly oppose the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and require all levels of Party organizations to improve their awareness through organizational life meetings, unify their thoughts, and fully play the role of the leading core and the fighting fortress.

2. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government issued the "Urgent Notice on Further Stabilizing the Social Order in the Province." It proposed that at present, the province should take stabilizing the situation and quickly restoring normal order as the top priority. Educate the broad cadres, masses, and youth students to understand the important position and role of Liaoning in the national economy, understand the relationship between stabilizing Liaoning and stabilizing the overall situation of the country. Cherish the achievements of reform and construction, cherish the stable and united situation. Resolutely stop the behavior of linking up with enterprises and inciting strikes, ensure that enterprises are not affected and do not stop production. The cadres and workers of the enterprises must guard their production posts, observe labor discipline, carry out the "Double Increase and Double Decrease" campaign, strive to improve the management level and economic benefits of the enterprises, and with practical actions contribute to stabilizing the social order and maintaining the stable and united political situation.

3. A meeting of the responsible comrades of some colleges and universities was held, emphasizing the continuation of the ideological work of the students. On the evening of June 5, the main leading comrade of the Provincial Party Committee proposed at a symposium that we must proceed from the reality of Liaoning to do a good job in stabilizing the situation in colleges and universities. It was required to resolutely dissuade students from going out to demonstrate, stop linking up with enterprises and blocking traffic, and prevent workers from going to work; quickly restore the normal teaching order of the schools; clearly announce that illegal organizations in the schools must immediately stop all activities, and all consequences caused by the activities organized by them must be fully responsible for by the organizers. It was required to continue to adhere to the policy of guidance, educate the broad youth students to understand the nature of this struggle, calmly and rationally consider problems, not to take rumors and various rumors as the basis for action, and not to do things that hurt their relatives and please their enemies.

4. Maintain social order and security, and strengthen the protection of key positions. It is necessary to strengthen the management of social order and security, concentrate forces to crack down on all kinds of criminal activities, especially to severely and swiftly publicly deal with criminals who take advantage of the chaos to engage in beating, smashing, looting, and burning activities.

Central State Organs Party Committee
To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council:

On June 3 and 4, a shocking counter-revolutionary rebellion occurred in the capital, Beijing. The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission made a decisive decision to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion and achieved initial success.

This counter-revolutionary rebellion was plotted by a few individuals, whose purpose was to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system. This is a severe political struggle concerning the life and death of the Party and the state. In the face of major issues of principle, all Communist Party members in the central state organs guarantee that we will firmly stand up and resolutely join this struggle to defend the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China. We are soberly aware that the current situation is still very severe. A few rebels are still unwilling to admit defeat and are plotting and waiting for an opportunity to counterattack; they are still spreading rumors and confusing people, trying to create greater chaos. In this severe situation, all levels of Party organizations and all Communist Party members and cadres in the central state organs are determined to unite as one under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, work together, and contribute to the thorough suppression of this counter-revolutionary rebellion, the quick stabilization of the situation, and the creation of a stable and good social environment.

To this end, we will firmly implement the requirements of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, immediately take action, and do the following:

1. Continue to organize all Party members and cadres to seriously study the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, correctly understand the severity of this counter-revolutionary rebellion and the importance of suppressing the rebellion. Understand the ruthlessness of a handful of counter-revolutionary rebels and their counter-revolutionary crimes. Firmly maintain consistency with the Party Central Committee in ideology, politics, organization, and action.

2. Educate all Party members and workers to heighten their awareness of the enemy, closely monitor the movements of a few rebels, and promptly report to the government and relevant departments the various crimes of these rebels, assisting the government in quickly apprehending and bringing these rebels to justice and severely punishing them according to law.

3. In this struggle, we must grasp the policy, unite the majority, and isolate and strike down a few rebels. We must strictly distinguish between the masses who do not understand the truth for the time being and a few rebels.

4. We must actively support and strongly assist the People's Liberation Army martial law troops. Units with troops stationed must actively do a good job in providing food, accommodation, medical care, and other living guarantees for the troops.

5. Educate the broad Party members and cadres to guard their posts in this special period, work together to overcome temporary difficulties. Do a good job in security and protection to prevent rebels from taking advantage of the situation to cause trouble.

6. In the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, all levels of Party organizations in the state organs must fully play the role of the fighting fortress, and all Communist Party members must play the model and leading role. We must adopt various methods to seriously do a good job in painstaking and meticulous ideological and political work; actively propagate and strongly commend the good deeds of protecting state property, fighting against rebels, and supporting and assisting the martial law troops in the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion; inspire fighting spirit, firm up confidence, unite the broad masses around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, and strive to achieve the final victory in the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

　　七军区两省中央国家机关分别致电函
    坚决拥护中央平息首都反革命暴乱
    新华社北京６月８日电  党中央、国务院、中央军委、解放军总政治部收到北京、沈阳、济南、南京、广州、成都、兰州军区党委的电函，表示坚决贯彻中共中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》。
    北京军区党中央、国务院、中央军委：
    中共中央、国务院发出的《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》，给了我们深刻的教育，极大地鼓舞了部队的士气。一个多月来，我们北京军区党委、机关和执行戒严任务的全体干部战士，亲眼目睹了极少数别有用心的人在首都蓄意制造的动乱，并实际地看到了由动乱发展成为反革命暴乱的大量事实，从而激起了无比的义愤。一致表示，坚决拥护党中央的英明决策和果断措施。
    我区戒严部队一定坚决贯彻执行党中央、国务院、中央军委的指示和规定，注意区分两类不同性质的矛盾，把广大群众和青年学生同极少数反革命暴乱分子严格区别开来。对极少数穷凶极恶的反革命暴乱分子要坚决打击，对广大人民群众和青年学生要坚决保护。我们要在部队中继续深入地开展“热爱首都，热爱首都人民，热爱青年学生”的教育，全心全意地维护人民群众的根本利益，以实际行动展示我军“威武之师、文明之师”的良好形象。
    平息反革命暴乱的斗争是复杂的、艰巨的。我们决心紧密地团结在党中央、国务院和中央军委的周围，同兄弟单位、武警部队、公安干警紧密团结，共同奋斗，在首都各级党政机关和广大人民群众的大力支持下，坚决地彻底地平息这场反革命暴乱，为保卫党中央、保卫社会主义的人民共和国做出应有的贡献，不获全胜，决不收兵。

    中共中央、中央军委：
    ６月４日以来，我们军区党委常委、机关和所属部队反复认真学习了党中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》，学习了《解放军报》６月４日社论。大家认为，在关系到党和国家前途命运的紧急关头，党中央、国务院、中央军委作出坚决镇压反革命暴乱的重大决策，非常及时，非常必要，代表了全党全军全国人民的根本利益，我们坚决拥护党中央、国务院、中央军委这一重大决策，全力支持戒严部队镇压反革命暴乱的果断行动，愤怒声讨极少数人制造反革命暴乱的罪行。
    大家历数一小撮暴徒冲击党和国家首脑要害部门，肆意打、砸、抢、烧、杀，残害我军官兵的一桩桩令人发指的暴行，感到无比愤慨。同志们说，事实说明，这是有组织有预谋向党发起的猖狂进攻，是一起骇人听闻的极其严重的反革命暴乱事件，其目的就是要推翻共产党和共和国政府，用反革命非法政治组织取而代之，如不及时采取果断措施，数千万先烈用鲜血和生命换来的人民江山将毁于一旦，整个中华民族将沦为黑暗的统治。因此，党中央、国务院、中央军委迅速采取果断措施平息这场暴乱，这是捍卫伟大的中国共产党、捍卫中华人民共和国、捍卫神圣的宪法、捍卫庄严的首都的正义行动，全区官兵受到极大鼓舞。
    大家清醒地看到，对反革命暴乱的镇压虽然取得了初步胜利，但斗争是复杂的，艰巨的，我们要把镇压反革命暴乱的教育，作为压倒一切的头等大事，深入学习党中央、国务院、中央军委关于制止反革命暴乱的一系列指示，继续声讨一小撮坏人制造反革命暴乱的严重罪行，揭露和批判反革命政治谣言，统一思想，坚定信心，在思想上、政治上、行动上与党中央保持一致。要坚守工作岗位，切实履行职责，加强组织纪律性，严格管理部队，保持部队的高度集中和统一。要加强军内军外团结，紧紧依靠地方政府和广大人民群众，揭露和打击一小撮坏人的阴谋和破坏活动，以坚定的立场，有效的措施和行动，为彻底平息暴乱、维护安定团结，经受考验，做出贡献。
    大家表示，我们是人民的子弟兵，永远忠于党、忠于人民，在此关键时刻决不辜负党和人民的重托，一定要圆满完成党中央、国务院和中央军委交给我们的任务。

    总政办公厅：
    ６月５日上午，济南军区党委常委认真收听了中共中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》，学习了６月４日《解放军报》社论和北京市市长陈希同同志的广播讲话。大家一致拥护党中央、国务院和中央军委作出的镇压反革命暴乱的英明决策，对一小撮暴徒在北京制造骇人听闻的反革命暴乱表示极大的愤慨，对在平息反革命暴乱中取得重大胜利的我英雄戒严部队、武警部队和公安干警，表示崇高的敬意，对光荣负伤的指战员表示亲切的慰问，对英勇献身的烈士表示深切的哀悼！
    学习讨论中，常委同志说，从６月３日凌晨到６月４日凌晨，丧心病狂的暴徒用打、砸、抢、烧、杀的暴行，把他们所谓的“爱国”和“民主”的假面具撕得精光，使这场妄图否定党的领导，否定社会主义制度、颠覆人民共和国的反革命暴乱的实质，昭然若揭，大白天下。惊心动魄的斗争，使我们愈加认识到《人民日报》“四·二六”社论精神的正确，更加感到党中央、国务院、中央军委在这场斗争中采取的一系列决策的正确。在党和国家命运面临严重威胁的紧要关头，如果不采取断然措施，坚决平息这场反革命暴乱，不仅无法捍卫首都的安宁和祖国的尊严，捍卫党的领导和社会主义制度，而且广大人民群众的生命安全也将受到严重威胁。在这场你死我活的斗争中，我人民解放军履行宪法赋予的神圣职责，和武警部队、公安干警一起，对一伙反革命歹徒奋起反击，完全符合全国各族人民的根本利益。目前，尽管极少数暴徒仍在散布谣言，制造事端，但事实终究会戳穿谎言，正义终究会战胜邪恶。在党中央、国务院和中央军委的正确领导下，在广大人民群众的支持下，我们一定能够取得这场斗争的彻底胜利。大家表示，坚决响应党中央的号召，挺身而出，带领全区部队为平息暴乱、稳定局势作出应有的贡献，让党中央、国务院、中央军委放心！
    为保证全区部队认真履行职责，坚决完成任务，军区党委要求各部队做到：一、立即组织部队认真学习《中共中央、国务院告全体共产党员和全国人民书》，把干部战士的思想统一到中央精神上来，保证全区部队同党中央保持高度一致，立场坚定、旗帜鲜明地支持党中央的决策。二、充分发挥广大党员在斗争中的先锋模范作用，各级党组织都要对所属党员严肃认真地进行一次党性党纪和党的观念的教育，引导大家自觉按照党的要求规范自己的言行，与党同心同德，站在斗争的前列，努力完成党和人民赋予的各项任务，经受住这场严峻斗争的考验。三、各级领导要坚守岗位，忠于职守，加强管理，严格纪律，保持部队的集中统一和稳定。四、密切注视社会动向，冷静、稳妥地处理可能遇到的各种情况。对一小撮歹徒的挑衅行径要坚决予以揭露，并协助地方政府予以打击。五、坚持正常的战备、训练、工作、生活秩序，统筹安排各项工作，既保证部队制止动乱、稳定局势任务的圆满完成，又保证以军事训练为中心的各项工作的顺利进行，以实际行动为夺取这场斗争的彻底胜利贡献全部力量。

    中共中央、国务院、中央军委：
    ６月４日和５日，军区党委常委认真学习中共中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》以及《解放军报》６月４日社论，一致认为，在首都发生骇人听闻的反革命暴乱、事关党和国家前途命运的紧要关头，党中央、国务院、中央军委采取果断措施，平息反革命暴乱，非常及时，十分正确，对广大人民群众是极大鼓舞，对极少数别有用心的人是威慑、瓦解。一致表示，坚决拥护党中央、国务院、中央军委的重大决策。并代表全区指战员，向在平息这场暴乱中作出贡献的戒严部队全体官兵和公安干警、武警部队指战员表示崇高的敬意和亲切的慰问！
    在首都发生的反革命暴乱中，极少数暴乱分子煽动一些不明真相的人砸毁焚烧军车，抢夺枪支弹药，冲击国家首脑要害部门，惨无人道地杀害解放军战士。他们的暴行彻底践踏宪法，严重威胁首都人民生命财产的安全。这是一个时期以来，极少数人阴谋制造动乱的恶性发展，是他们反对中国共产党的领导，反对社会主义制度，颠覆中华人民共和国罪恶企图的集中暴露。迅速平息这场反革命暴乱，捍卫了伟大的中华人民共和国，捍卫了改革开放的成果，符合全国人民的愿望和根本利益。动乱不止，暴乱不平，人民不得安宁，国家不得安宁，实现四化、振兴中华将成为泡影。我们一定立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，把这场严峻的斗争进行到底。
    平息反革命暴乱虽然取得第一步胜利，但首都的形势仍很严峻。我们坚信，在党中央、国务院、中央军委领导下，完全能够彻底平息反革命暴乱。我们一定紧急行动起来，响应党中央、国务院和中央军委的号召，组织全区部队认真学习党中央、国务院和中央军委的一系列重要指示，擦亮眼睛，明辨是非，坚定立场，增强信心，在思想上、行动上和党中央保持一致。迅速做好制止动乱、平息暴乱的各项准备工作，坚决听从党中央、国务院、中央军委的指挥，坚守岗位，严守纪律，履行职责，努力完成赋予的各项任务。主动加强与地方党委、政府的联系，积极协助地方做好广大工人、学生和城市居民的工作，最大限度地孤立和打击极少数阴谋制造暴乱的坏人。充分发挥党团组织的作用，发挥共产党员、各级干部的模范带头作用。努力做好东南沿海的战备工作，落实各项战备制度和措施，加强军警民联防，随时准备粉碎敌人的袭扰和破坏活动。我们一定带领全区部队，以高昂的斗志，为制止动乱、平息暴乱作出贡献。

    中央军委、总政治部：
    ６月４日，我戒严部队在忍无可忍的情况下，采取果断行动，一举平息了发生在北京的一场严重的反革命暴乱，胜利地保卫了伟大社会主义祖国的首都，用鲜血和生命捍卫了人民政权。消息传来，军区党委常委立即进行了学习讨论，大家对极少数人阴谋策划并唆使一些歹徒在首都制造反革命暴乱的罪恶行径表示极大愤慨，对党中央、国务院、中央军委为平息暴乱所采取的英明决策表示坚决拥护，对在这场斗争中做出重大贡献的戒严部队表示崇高敬意。
    连日来，一小撮对党、对国家、对军队怀有刻骨仇恨的反动分子，公然提出“拿起武器，推翻现政府，打倒共产党”的反革命行动纲领。他们与国内外敌对势力紧密勾结，占据天安门广场，冲击党和国家首脑机关，烧楼房、抢商店，并惨无人道地杀害我战士，焚烧我军车，抢夺我武器，无恶不作，无法无天，完全暴露了他们打着要求“民主自由”旗号，推翻共产党，颠覆社会主义制度的狰狞面目。对这伙反革命暴徒如不坚决镇压，党无宁日，国无宁日。平息这场反革命暴乱，是捍卫人民政权和宪法尊严的正义之举，是符合全国人民根本利益的正义之举。
    我军区部队地处祖国南大门，肩负着保卫祖国边海防安全，保卫改革开放胜利成果的光荣使命，并负有协助地方维护社会治安、保护人民生命财产安全的重责。我们军区党委一致表示，在大是大非斗争面前立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，一如既往地团结在党中央、中央军委的周围，保持部队的高度集中统一，切实做好应付可能出现的各种复杂情况的准备，落实好各项战备措施，严防国内外敌人的破坏和骚扰。保证做到中央军委一声令下，立即出动，为保卫祖国，保卫人民的和平劳动作出贡献。我们坚信，在党中央的正确领导下，一定能取得这场斗争的彻底胜利。

    　　　　辽宁省
    中共中央、国务院、中央军委：
    ６月３日至４日，首都北京发生了骇人听闻的反革命暴乱。人民解放军戒严部队的官兵和武警官兵、公安干警，依靠广大人民群众和青年学生的积极配合、支持，果断地平息了这场暴乱。６月５日，中共中央、国务院发布《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》，揭露了这一暴乱的事实真相，深刻指出了这场政治斗争的性质，向全体共产党员和广大人民群众发出了团结一致、坚决粉碎这场反革命暴乱，把建设和改革进行到底的号召。当天上午，由全树仁同志主持召开了有省委、省顾委、省人大、省政府、省政协、省纪委领导同志参加的联席会议，进行了认真的学习和讨论。大家一致认为，发生在首都的这场反革命暴乱，是建国以来从未有过的，是一个时期以来极少数人阴谋制造动乱的恶性发展，是他们反对中国共产党的领导、反对社会主义制度罪恶企图的集中暴露。如果他们的阴谋得逞，几千万先烈用生命换来的人民共和国将被颠覆，社会主义建设和十年改革的成果将毁于一旦，一个很有前途很有希望的中国，将会变成一个没有前途没有希望的中国。大家表示，坚决拥护党中央、国务院、中央军委为平息反革命暴乱所采取的重大决策。大家指出，这一重大决策是为了捍卫我国神圣宪法、稳定社会秩序、维护安定团结的局面而采取的，符合党心民心，符合全国人民的根本利益的，是非常必要和完全正确的。我们向在平息这场暴乱中做出卓越贡献的人民解放军首都戒严部队、武警部队指战员和广大公安干警，表示崇高的敬意和亲切的慰问。
    为了响应党中央和国务院的号召，稳定辽宁的局势，我们采取了以下措施：
    １、立即组织广大党员、团员、干部和职工群众，认真学习中共中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全体人民书》，引导大家深刻认识这场反革命暴乱的性质，深刻认识党中央为平息反革命暴乱所采取果断措施的重大意义。６月５日下午，省委、省政府发出了《关于认真学习〈中共中央、国务院告全体共产党员和全国人民书〉的通知》，要求全省共产党员、共青团员和国家机关工作人员，必须坚信党中央、国务院的正确决策，坚定地在政治上同党中央保持一致，立场坚定、旗帜鲜明地反对反革命暴乱。要求各级党组织通过组织生活会的形式，提高认识，统一思想，充分发挥领导核心作用和战斗堡垒作用。
    ２、省委、省政府发出《进一步稳定全省社会秩序的紧急通知》。提出，当前全省要把稳定局势、迅速恢复正常秩序作为压倒一切的首要任务。教育广大干部、群众和青年学生认清辽宁在我国国民经济中的重要地位和作用，认清稳定辽宁与稳定全国大局的关系。珍惜改革和建设已取得的成果，珍惜安定团结的局面。要坚决制止到企业串联、煽动罢工的行为，保证企业不受冲击、不停产。企业的干部和职工要坚守生产岗位，遵守劳动纪律，深入开展双增双节运动，努力提高企业管理水平和经济效益，以实际行动为稳定社会秩序、维护安定团结的政治局面做出贡献。
    ３、召开了部分大专院校负责同志会议，强调继续做好学生的思想工作。６月５日晚，省委主要领导同志在座谈会上提出，要从辽宁的实际出发，做好稳定高校局势的工作。要求必须坚决地劝阻学生上街游行、制止到企业串联和堵塞交通、阻止职工上班等行动，尽快恢复学校正常的教学秩序；明确宣布，学校非法组织必须立即停止一切活动，凡由它们组织的活动所造成的一切后果，要由组织者负完全责任。要继续坚持疏导的方针，教育广大青年学生认清这场斗争的性质，冷静、理智地考虑问题，不要把谣言和各种传说作为行动的依据，不要做亲痛仇快的事情。
    ４、维护社会治安秩序，加强要害部位的保卫工作。要加强社会治安的管理，集中力量打击各种违法犯罪活动，特别是从重从快公开处理趁混乱之机进行打、砸、抢、烧等破坏活动的犯罪分子。

    ６月３日、４日，首都北京发生了一场骇人听闻的反革命暴乱。党中央、国务院、中央军委作出了平息反革命暴乱的果断决策，并取得了初步的胜利。
    这场反革命暴乱是极少数人阴谋策划的，其目的是妄图推翻中国共产党的领导，推翻社会主义制度。这是一场关系到党和国家生死存亡的严酷的政治斗争。在大是大非面前，我们中央国家机关的全体共产党员保证立场坚定，旗帜鲜明地投入到这场捍卫中国共产党、捍卫中华人民共和国的斗争中去。我们清醒地认识到，当前面临的局势仍然十分严峻，极少数暴乱分子，仍不甘心失败，还在那里阴谋策划，伺机反扑；还在制造谣言，蛊惑人心，妄图制造更大的混乱。在这种严峻的形势下，中央国家机关各级党组织、全体共产党员和干部决心在党中央、国务院的领导下，同心同德，团结一致，做好工作，经受考验，为彻底平息这场反革命暴乱，尽快稳定局势，创造安定和良好的社会环境作出积极的贡献。
    为此，我们坚决遵照中共中央、国务院的要求，立即行动起来，做好以下几项工作：
    一、继续组织全体党员、干部认真学习《中共中央、国务院告全体党员和全国人民书》，正确认识这场反革命暴乱的严重性和平息暴乱的重要意义。认清一小撮反革命暴徒的残忍性及其反革命罪行。坚决做到在思想上、政治上、组织上、行动上与党中央保持一致。
    二、教育全体党员和职工，要提高敌情观念，密切注视极少数暴乱分子的动向，及时向政府和有关单位检举揭发他们的各种罪行，协助政府尽快地将这些暴乱分子捉拿归案，依法严惩。
    三、在这场斗争中，注意掌握政策，团结大多数，孤立和打击极少数暴乱分子。一定要把一时不明真相的群众和极少数暴乱分子严格区分开来。
    四、我们一定要积极支持和大力协助中国人民解放军戒严部队。有部队进驻的单位，要积极做好部队的食宿、医疗等各项生活保障工作。
    五、要教育广大党员、干部，在当前非常时期，坚守岗位，齐心协力克服暂时出现的困难。要做好安全保卫工作，严防暴徒乘机破坏。
    六、在平息反革命暴乱的斗争中，国家机关各级党的组织要充分发挥战斗堡垒作用，全体共产党员要发挥模范带头作用。要采取各种方式方法，认真做好艰苦细致的思想政治工作；要积极宣传、大力表彰在平息反革命暴乱中，保护国家财产，与暴徒进行英勇斗争，以实际行动支持和帮助戒严部队的好人好事；鼓舞斗志，坚定信心，把广大群众团结在党中央、国务院的周围，以夺取平息反革命暴乱斗争的最后胜利。
