The sudden announcement by the second-largest supercomputer company in the United States, ETA, that it would close down has caused serious concern among American scientists and politicians. The fear is that the disappearance of this company, coupled with the rise of Japanese companies, may threaten the United States' dominant position in the global supercomputer market.

ETA was established in 1983 and was a company with 750 employees and strong technical capabilities. Over the past few years, the company sold 34 supercomputers. To support the development of the U.S. supercomputer industry, the federal government provided annual funding to ETA. However, due to continuous losses, its parent company was forced to announce its closure in April.

More intriguingly, ETA's closure came just weeks after two Japanese supercomputer companies announced their plans to develop new-generation products, further fueling concerns about the future of the U.S. supercomputer industry.

Supercomputers are a key area of intense competition between the United States and Japan. They not only have high computational speeds but also have wide-ranging military and civilian applications. They can be used in the manufacture of warships, submarines, fighter jets, and nuclear weapons, as well as in the production of new chemicals, materials, pharmaceuticals, and automobiles, and for weather forecasting. The New York Times has dubbed them the "strategic technology" of the contemporary era. Since Cray Research introduced the first supercomputer in 1979, the supercomputer industry has developed rapidly. It is said that by the mid-1990s, the United States and Japan will develop a new generation of artificial intelligence computers with analytical, reasoning, voice recognition, and decision-making capabilities. Statistics show that the global supercomputer sales in 1988 amounted to $967 million, three times the figure for 1984. Of this, the United States accounted for about 70%, while Japan accounted for 30%. In terms of quantity, there are currently 409 supercomputers in the world, of which 220 are manufactured by Cray Research in the United States, while three Japanese companies manufactured 132. This shows that the United States currently holds a dominant position.

To maintain its leading position, the U.S. government has mainly adopted two measures to encourage and protect the industry: providing funding to supercomputer companies and requiring government departments to purchase "domestic products." Some private enterprises also view the purchase of foreign goods as "unpatriotic." In addition, since 1984, the U.S. government has established five supercomputer centers through the National Science Foundation, not only opening up markets for manufacturers but also training a large number of specialists in supercomputer development.

However, many scientists have warned that Japan will eventually pose a serious threat to the United States in this high-tech field. The United States is planning new development strategies. Congress committees will hold hearings on this and discuss countermeasures with supercomputer companies. Some members of Congress have called for increased funding to establish a "national supercomputer network system." Some government agencies will propose spending $4.2 billion over the next five years to develop supercomputers. Supercomputer manufacturers also hope the government will relax export restrictions to open up foreign markets. In addition, companies like International Business Machines are also developing their own supercomputers.

Japan is also planning its future development strategies. Its advantage lies in the strong financial backing of Japanese companies and their non-urgent business approach, which is precisely the weakness of the United States. Whether the United States will "yield" to Japan in this high-tech field is still uncertain, but the competition between the two sides will undoubtedly be fierce.

　　美日巨型计算机之争
    本报记者  张亮
    美国第二大巨型电子计算机公司——ＥＴＡ公司不久前突然宣布关闭，引起美国科技界甚至朝野人士的严重不安，人们担心的是，这家公司的消失和日本公司的奋起直追是否会威胁美国在世界巨型机市场上的垄断地位。
    ＥＴＡ公司创建于一九八三年，是一个拥有七百五十名雇员、技术力量雄厚的巨型计算机制造公司。在过去几年中，这家公司共销售三十四台巨型计算机。为了扶持该公司以加速美国巨型计算机事业的发展，联邦政府每年都向它提供资助。但是，因它连年亏损，其母公司四月间被迫宣布处以它“死刑”。
    更耐人寻味的是，ＥＴＡ公司是在日本两家巨型计算机公司宣布开发新一代产品的计划数星期之后关闭的，这就进一步加重了人们对美国巨型计算机发展前景的忧虑。　　巨型计算机是美国和日本激烈竞争的一项高科技。它不仅运算速度快，而且具有广泛的军用和民用价值，既可用于军舰、潜艇、战斗机和核武器的制造，也可用于新型化学制品、材料、药品和汽车的生产等，还能用于天气预报。纽约时报称它为当代的“战略技术”。自一九七九年美国克雷公司推出第一台巨型计算机以来，巨型计算机行业迅猛发展，据说，到九十年代中期，美日两国将研制出具有分析、推理、辨别声音和决策功能的新一代人工智能计算机。有关材料统计，一九八八年世界巨型计算机销售总额为九点六七亿美元，是一九八四年的三倍，其中美国大约占百分之七十，日本占百分之三十。就数量而言，目前世界上共有四百零九台巨型计算机，其中二百二十台由美国克雷公司制造，而日本三家公司仅制造一百三十二台。由此可见，眼下美国仍处于垄断地位。
    为了保持其领先地位，美国政府主要采取了两种鼓励和保护措施：一是向巨型计算机公司提供资助，二是要求政府部门必须买“国货”，一些私人企业也把购买外国货视为“不爱国”。此外，从一九八四年起美国政府还通过全国科学基金会建立了五个巨型计算机中心，不仅为厂家打开了销路，而且培养大量从事巨型计算机研制的专门人才。
    不过，许多科学家警告说，日本在这一高科技领域最终将对美国构成严重威胁。美国正在规划新的发展计划。国会有关委员会将就此举行听证会，并同巨型计算机公司共商对策。有的议员要求政府增加拨款，在全国建立“巨型计算机网络系统”。一些政府机构将提议在今后五年内耗资四十二亿美元发展巨型计算机。巨型计算机制造公司还希望政府放宽出口限制，以开拓国外市场。此外，国际商业机器公司等几家电子计算机公司也正在研制自己的巨型计算机。
    日本也在筹划今后的发展战略，其优势在于日本公司资金雄厚和它们不追求急功近利的经营之道，而这正是美国的劣势。美国在这一高科技领域是否会“让位”于日本，现在尚难预料，但双方的角逐无疑将是十分激烈的。
