Approximately 100,000 Shanghai workers and militia members, along with some government officials and police officers, took to the streets early this morning to clear the remaining 48 roadblocks in the city. Shanghai's traffic has, for the first time since June 4, basically resumed normal operations.

At various intersections, workers and militia members wore armbands and badges while on duty, assisting police in maintaining traffic order. According to the city's public transportation company, starting from the first bus at 4:15 AM today, 130 bus routes in the urban area have been operational. Various motor vehicles have also been put into service on time. By 6 AM, more than 2,500 public transport vehicles were in operation. As of noon when this report was filed, the operation situation was basically normal.

Since June 4, a small number of people have repeatedly set up more than 100 roadblocks in Shanghai's urban areas, causing the city's traffic to completely paralyze. Workers were unable to go to work, production decreased; although supplies were abundant, they could not be delivered to retail points, causing difficulties for citizens' lives, and pedestrians had no sense of security. Furthermore, several groups of "flying tiger" bicycle gangs and individuals with ulterior motives repeatedly blocked public transportation vehicles, either by setting up temporary roadblocks or puncturing tires to release air, brazenly inciting chaos. The situation even escalated to overturning and burning vehicles, torching police cars and motorcycles, and assaulting on-duty police officers. From the night of June 7 to the early morning of June 8, a serious riot involving the arson of railway vehicles at the Guangxin Road intersection occurred, an incident unprecedented in Shanghai's history.

In response to this situation, the Shanghai Municipal Government called on all citizens to mobilize, stabilize Shanghai, maintain order, continue production, and ensure living conditions, which was met with enthusiastic support from the broad masses of citizens. Shanghai's local newspapers and radio and television stations organized discussions on "Shanghai cannot be chaotic, what should we do?" Shanghai's Mayor Zhu Rongji addressed the city's residents via television last night. The Shanghai working class, with its glorious traditions, began to take action, organizing workers' militia while continuing production. Over three consecutive nights, they dispatched 6,500, 36,000, and 20,000 people respectively to clear roadblocks. This action reached its peak early this morning.

It is understood that after three days of preparation, each district in Shanghai today organized teams of 10,000 to 20,000 people. The city has 32 key large factories that organized a mobile force of tens of thousands of people. Their mission is to quickly clear roadblocks and maintain smooth traffic throughout the city. Today, the workers and militia members are on duty all day, guarding their posts, dissuading those who attempt to set up new roadblocks, and assisting police officers in maintaining traffic order. A responsible person from the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions made a statement on this, pointing out that the working class should become the main force in stabilizing Shanghai.

　　上海十万工纠队员清除路障
    全市交通６月４日以来首次基本恢复
    新华社上海６月９日电  约１０万名上海工人纠察队员和部分机关干部、公安干警今天凌晨走上街头，清除了全市尚存的４８处路障。上海市交通６月４日以来首次基本畅通。
    在各个路口，工人纠察队员佩戴袖章、胸章执勤，协助民警维持交通秩序。据市公交公司反映，自今天凌晨４时１５分头班车发出起，市区已有１３０条公交线路出车。各路机动车也适时投入运营。至早晨６时，投入运营的公交载客车已达２５００多辆。截至记者中午发稿时，运行情况基本正常。
    自６月４日以来，少数人反复在上海市区设立１００多处路障，致使全市交通全面瘫痪，工人不能上班，生产下降；物资虽然很充分，但是运不到零售点，市民生活发生困难，路上行人没有安全感。更有数股自行车“飞虎队”及别有用心的人，到处对公交车辆突施拦堵，或临时设置路障，或戳破轮胎放气，肆无忌惮煽动破坏，甚至发展到推翻和焚烧汽车，烧警车、摩托车，殴打值勤民警的地步。７日夜至８日凌晨，终于酿成光新路道口一场上海多少年来从未有过的纵火焚烧铁路车辆的严重骚乱。
    针对这种状况，上海市政府号召全市人民动员起来，稳定上海，稳定大局，坚持生产，保障生活，受到广大市民的热烈拥护。上海市地方报纸和电台、电视台组织“上海不能乱，我们怎么办”的讨论。上海市市长朱熔基昨晚向全市人民发表电视讲话。具有光荣传统的上海工人阶级开始行动起来，在坚持生产的同时，组织起工人纠察队，连续３个晚上分别出动６５００人、３．６万人和２万人清理路障。这一行动今天凌晨达到高潮。
    据了解，经过３天准备，上海市今天各区都组织起一、二万人的队伍。全市有３２个骨干大厂还组织了一支几万人的机动力量。他们的任务是迅速清除路障，保持全市道路顺畅。今天工纠队员们全天值班，坚守岗位，对重新设置路障的人进行劝阻，并协助公安干警，维持交通秩序。上海市总工会负责人就此发表谈话指出，工人阶级要成为稳定上海的主力军。
