El Salvador underwent a government change on June 1. The ruling Christian Democratic Party handed over power to the far-right Nationalist Republican Alliance. Former President Duarte, insincerely, expressed pride in the peaceful transfer of power. However, Cristiani's ascension has raised widespread concerns about the complexities of the situation in El Salvador.

Although Cristiani was nominated by a far-right organization, he proposed a moderate free-market economic program that appealed to the interests of business owners and landowners, securing their support. On the other hand, the election was conducted under the threat of force, with nearly half of the 1.8 million registered voters not participating. Cristiani's actual vote count was only 27% of the total registered voters. Therefore, not only does the guerrilla not recognize the Cristiani government, but the public opinion in Central American countries also questions the legitimacy of the election results.

For many years, the far-right Nationalist Republican Alliance has been an unstable factor in El Salvador's turbulent situation. Its founder, D'Aubuisson, is suspected of involvement in the murder of Archbishop Romero and is linked to the terrorist organization "Death Squads," persecuting progressives and those sympathetic to progress, and exacerbating conflicts. To prevent the rise of far-right forces in El Salvador and to avoid complicating the situation, the U.S. government has consistently supported the "moderate" Duarte's Christian Democratic Party. In recent years, the U.S. has provided over $100 million in military aid and substantial economic aid annually, attempting to establish a democratic model in the heart of Central America. However, the Christian Democratic Party proved to be "a weakling," unable to handle the guerrilla forces or the domestic far-right competition. Therefore, the U.S. also harbors doubts about the victory of the far-right, maintaining a cautious stance.

Additionally, the relationship between the Salvadoran military and the far-right Nationalist Republican Alliance is not harmonious.

The extent to which these factors will affect the Cristiani government over time and scope remains to be seen. However, the most critical issue is the relationship with the guerrilla forces. Just days before Cristiani's inauguration, the guerrilla proposed peace talks with the new government, with the primary condition being the legal prosecution of the mastermind behind the terror and persecution of the people, D'Aubuisson. This proposal is something Cristiani is fundamentally unable to achieve. As the founder of the Nationalist Republican Alliance, D'Aubuisson controls the real power within the party and imposes various restrictions on the moderate Cristiani. Cristiani avoids D'Aubuisson at all costs, let alone legally prosecuting him. Therefore, Cristiani has consistently taken a hardline stance against the guerrilla, stating that only their "surrender" can be discussed. Although he proposed dialogue with the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front in his inauguration speech, it is likely still just a political gesture. From various indications, the conflict between the far-right Nationalist Republican Alliance government and the guerrilla forces may further escalate. Due to the interests represented by the Nationalist Republican Alliance, which include large landowners and business owners, there will also be conflicts with the broad masses of farmers and the lower classes. Under these circumstances, the contradictions among various classes in El Salvador will further intensify. Although it is too early to judge the situation under Cristiani's rule, the emergence of far-right forces will undoubtedly have a complex impact on El Salvador's political landscape.

　　萨尔瓦多政局复杂化
    本报记者  郭伟成
    萨尔瓦多６月１日进行了政府更换。执政的基督教民主党拱手出让江山，由极右派的民族主义共和联盟取而代之。杜阿尔特前总统言不由衷，称对于国家政权实现和平交接感到“骄傲”。但是，克里斯蒂亚尼的上台，还是引起了人们对萨尔瓦多局势复杂化的普遍担忧。
    克里斯蒂亚尼虽然由极右派组织提名，但是提出了一个温和的自由市场经济的纲领，迎合了企业主、庄园主阶级的利益，争取到了支持。另一方面，大选在刺刀下进行，登记选民１８０万中有近半数没有参加投票，克里斯蒂亚尼实际所得票数只占全国登记选民的２７％。因此，不仅游击队不承认克里斯蒂亚尼政府，连中美洲各国舆论也对此种大选结果的合法性表示怀疑。
    多年来，在萨尔瓦多动荡的局势中，极右派的民族主义共和联盟一直是个不稳定因素。其创始人达比松不仅涉嫌谋杀罗梅洛大主教，而且勾结恐怖组织“敢死队”，迫害进步与同情进步的人士，处处激化矛盾。为了避免极右势力在萨尔瓦多抬头，使局势复杂化，美国政府一直全力支持“中间派”杜阿尔特的基民党政权。近年来，美国每年都要提供１亿多美元的军援与大量经援，试图在中美洲腹地树立一个民主样板。但是，想不到基民党是“扶不起的刘阿斗”，不仅对付不了游击队，也对付不了国内极右派的竞争。因此，美国对于极右派的获胜也抱有疑虑，表态十分谨慎。
    此外，萨尔瓦多军方与极右派的民族主义共和联盟之间也不很融洽。
    这些因素会在多长时间、多大范围内对克里斯蒂亚尼政府造成影响，还有待观察。但是，最重要的恐怖是与游击队的关系。就在克里斯蒂亚尼就职的前几天，游击队提出了与新政府的和谈建议，首要条件是依法惩办制造恐怖、迫害人民的元凶达比松。这一建议当然是克里斯蒂亚尼根本无法办到的。身为民族主义共和联盟创始人的达比松，控制着党内的实权，对温和派的克里斯蒂亚尼多方钳制。克里斯蒂亚尼避之犹恐不及，何论依法惩办。因此克里斯蒂亚尼在执政前一直对游击队持强硬态度，声称只能讨论游击队的“投降”问题。尽管他在就职中提出要与游击队法拉本多·马蒂民族解放阵线对话，但是，在目前来说，多半还只是一个政治姿态。从种种迹象来看，极右派的民族主义共和联盟政府与游击队之间矛盾可能会进一步激化。由于民族主义共和联盟所代表的大庄园主、企业主利益，也会与广大农民和下层群众的利益发生冲突，在这种情况下，萨尔瓦多国内各阶层的矛盾也会进一步激化。虽然现在判断克里斯蒂亚尼执政后的形势还为时尚早，但是，由于极右势力的粉墨登场，势必对萨尔瓦多政局产生复杂的影响。
