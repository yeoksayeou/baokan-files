Wheat beer, also known as wheat beer, is primarily made from malted wheat and fermented with top-fermenting yeast. Wheat beer is popular among consumers in Europe. In West Germany, wheat beer accounts for about one-fifth of the country's total beer production. Why is it so popular? Mainly because it has a higher fermentation degree than lager beer, is rich in carbon dioxide, has a light bitter taste, and a low alcohol content, making it an ideal beverage for people of all ages.

The most famous wheat beer in France is Berlin wheat beer. Its brewing process, quality, and flavor are unique; it is fermented with lactic acid bacteria, has a slightly sour taste, and a milky white color. Due to its high lactic acid content, it is rich in nutrients, refreshing to the throat, and aids digestion, making it particularly popular among consumers.

In the Bavarian region of West Germany, such as Munich, consumers enjoy adding a slice of fresh lemon to their wheat beer when drinking it, which gives it a unique flavor. There are numerous beer halls in West Berlin, reportedly over 600. In the street beer halls of West Berlin, people prefer to mix wheat beer with lingonberry juice or elderberry juice and drink it while enjoying meatballs, creating a lively and enjoyable atmosphere.

Belgium is the second-largest beer-producing country in Europe, with over 400 different types of beer. Several cities and regions produce distinctive wheat beers, such as the "Hoegaarden" wheat beer from Hoegaarden and the "Grimbergen" wheat beer from Halle. These beers are made with carefully selected ingredients, and the brewing water is softened. Top-fermenting yeast is used, and the beer is fermented at low temperatures and stored in deep cellars. The resulting wheat beer has a milky white appearance, a comfortable mouthfeel, a pure and gentle flavor, and gives a warm and elegant feeling.

　　夏品白啤酒
    颜坤琰
    白啤酒也叫麦氏啤酒，它的主要原料是小麦芽，发酵时一般添加的是上面发酵酵母。白啤酒在欧洲颇受消费者欢迎。西德的白啤酒产量约占全国啤酒总产量的１／５。它为何如此受宠呢，主要由于它的发酵程度比黄啤酒高，二氧化碳气充足，苦味不重，酒精含量低，是老少咸宜的理想饮料。
    法国最有名的白啤酒是柏林白啤酒，它的酿造工艺、品质、风味均别具一格；采用乳酸菌发酵，口味略酸，色微乳白。由于其乳酸含量高，营养丰富，饮用时爽口清喉，并能帮助消化，所以特别受到消费者的喜爱。
    西德巴伐利亚地区，如慕尼黑等城市的白啤酒消费者，在饮用白啤酒时，喜欢往酒杯内放一片新鲜的柠檬，喝起来别有一番滋味。西柏林啤酒馆如林，据说有６００多家。在西柏林的街头啤酒馆里，人们则喜欢把白啤酒和山莓汁或香车兰草汁混合起来饮用，并且一边喝白啤酒一边大嚼肉丸子，那种开怀畅饮的神态令人艳羡。
    比利时是欧洲第二大啤酒国，能生产４００多种啤酒，有好几个城市和地区生产各具特色的白啤酒，如刚城的“余提”白啤酒，海洛省的“格里萨特”白啤酒在欧洲乃至世界都是很出名的。它选料考究，酿酒用水都要经过软化处理，使用上面发酵酵母，低温发酵，深窖贮藏，这样酿出来的白啤酒酒体呈乳白色，口感舒适，味道纯正柔和，给人一种温馨淡雅的感觉。
