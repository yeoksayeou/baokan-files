In the "City of Coal and Electricity," Fuxin, Liaoning Province, a group of over 100 children aged 4 to 12 are actively engaged in artistic photography. The creative works of these "little photographers" have garnered significant attention.

The main organizer of this activity is Du Yuqi, a young cadre at the Fuxin Municipal Folk Art Museum. At the end of 1986, Du Yuqi started the first session of the children's artistic photography training class in the city, offering free training. Later, he established two activity centers in collaboration with a primary school and a kindergarten, and organized the formation of the Children's Photography Association. Currently, there are 136 "little photographers" participating in the activities. As their photographic skills improve, the children's works have begun to be showcased in prestigious venues.

　　阜新百余“小摄影家”创作成果令人瞩目
    新华社沈阳电  在“煤电之城”辽宁阜新市，活跃着一支由１００多名４岁到１２岁小朋友组成的少儿艺术摄影队伍。这些“小摄影家”的创作成果，受到人们的瞩目。
    这项活动的主要组织者是阜新市群众艺术馆青年干部杜玉奇。１９８６年末，杜玉奇在市内开办了第一期少儿艺术摄影学习班，实行免费培训，以后又与一所小学和一所幼儿园联系建立了幼儿、少儿两个活动中心，并组织成立了小朋友摄影学会。目前参加活动的“小摄影家”达１３６人。随着摄影艺术水平的提高，孩子们的作品也开始登上大雅之堂。
