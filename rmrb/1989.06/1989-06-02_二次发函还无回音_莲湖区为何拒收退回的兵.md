In May 1988, the newspaper received a letter from two soldiers, Peng Zhenggang and Xia Zhaohua, stationed in Jiayuguan, Gansu Province. The letter detailed the following:

A soldier surnamed Lu from our unit enlisted from Xi'an City in late 1985. It is understood that in July 1983, he was sentenced to two years in prison for robbery by the Lianhu District People's Court in Xi'an. However, his enlistment file does not record this. The file includes a political review from the Hansenzhai Sub-district Office of the New City Public Security Bureau in Xi'an, stating: "Lu graduated from the 21st Middle School in Xi'an in 1985. After investigation, he meets the enlistment criteria and is approved for enlistment." The 21st Middle School in Xi'an issued a certificate stating: "Lu is a 1985 graduate of our school. During his time here, he voluntarily complied with national laws and regulations, loved the country, and aligned with the Party Central Committee's guidelines, policies, and principles. This is to certify." His parents' work units also issued similar certificates, all stamped with official seals.

During his service, Lu did not follow military discipline, receiving an administrative demerit for multiple fights and desertion. He also hid handgun bullets and electric detonators. According to relevant regulations and his behavior in the military, our unit decided to discharge him early, which was approved by higher authorities. However, when we sent someone to the relevant departments in Lianhu District, Xi'an City, to handle the transfer, they refused to accept him on the grounds that "his service term has not expired" and "it is not the demobilization season."

Currently, Lu is still in the military camp. His poor behavior has had a bad influence on our unit and seriously affected the military's reputation.

In June 1988, the newspaper's Mass Work Department sent a letter to the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee, requesting them to instruct relevant departments to investigate:

Soldiers Peng Zhenggang and Xia Zhaohua from the Jiayuguan garrison in Gansu Province wrote to us, reporting that a soldier named Lu, who enlisted from Xi'an City, fought, deserted, and hid handgun bullets and electric detonators in the military. The military handled his early discharge according to relevant regulations; however, relevant departments in Lianhu District, Xi'an City, refused to accept him.

The letter also mentioned that Lu was sentenced to two years in prison in July 1983 by the Lianhu District Court in Xi'an for robbery, but the Hansenzhai Sub-district Office and the 21st Middle School in Xi'an concealed this fact. We are forwarding a copy of their letter. Please instruct relevant departments to investigate and report the handling results to us as soon as possible.

On December 22, 1988, the newspaper's Mass Work Department sent another letter to the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee, urging them to provide an update on the investigation:

On June 9, 1988, we sent you a letter regarding the issues raised by Peng Zhenggang and others from the Jiayuguan garrison. We requested the municipal committee to instruct relevant departments to investigate and report the handling results to us as soon as possible. Half a year has passed, and we have not received any response. We do not know the current investigation status. Please inform us promptly.

(This letter has been sent out, but there is still no response. We are publishing the readers' letter and the two letters from our Mass Work Department, hoping that the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee will promptly inform us of the investigation results to account to the readers.)

### 二次发函还无回音——莲湖区为何拒收退回的兵

　　二次发函还无回音——
    莲湖区为何拒收退回的兵
    １９８８年５月，本报收到甘肃嘉峪关市驻军彭正刚、夏召华两位同志的如下来信：
    我部一个姓卢的战士，１９８５年底从西安市入伍。据了解，１９８３年７月，他因犯抢劫罪，曾被西安市莲湖区人民法院判处有期徒刑两年。但是，在他的入伍档案中却没有记载，档案中附了西安市公安局新城分局韩森寨派出所的政审材料，记明：“卢某于１９８５年毕业于西安市第二十一中学，经调查，符合应征条件，同意入伍。”西安市第二十一中出具的证明写道：“卢某系我校１９８５年高中毕业生，在学校期间，能自觉遵守国家的法律、法令，热爱祖国，能同党中央的路线方针、政策保持一致，特此证明。”他父母的所在单位也都出具有类似的证明，并都加盖了公章。
    卢在服役期间，不遵守部队纪律，因多次打架斗殴，私自逃离部队受过行政记大过处分一次。他还私藏手枪子弹、电雷管。我部根据有关规定和卢在部队的表现，对他作出提前退役处理，并得到上级部门批准。但是，当我们派人到西安市莲湖区有关部门办理交接时，他们却以卢“服役期未满”、“不到退伍季节”为由，拒绝接收。
    现在，卢某仍留在军营，他的恶劣表现在我部队造成极坏影响，严重影响了我军的声誉。
    １９８８年６月本报群众工作部给中共西安市委发函，请他们责成有关部门查处：
    甘肃嘉峪关市驻军彭正刚、夏召华给本报来信反映，西安市应征入伍的战士卢某到部队后打架斗殴，私自逃离部队，私藏手枪子弹、电雷管等。部队按有关规定对卢作出提前退役的处理；但西安市莲湖区有关部门却拒绝接收。
    来信还说，卢于１９８３年７月因犯抢劫罪被西安市莲湖区法院判处有期徒刑两年，但韩森寨派出所和西安市二十一中学却隐瞒这一事实。现转去他们来信的复印件，请市委责成有关部门查处，并将处理结果尽快函告我部。
    １９８８年１２月２２日本报群众工作部再次致函中共西安市委，催促处理情况：
    １９８８年６月９日，我部给你们去函，就嘉峪关市驻军彭正刚等反映的问题，请市委责成有关部门查处，并望将处理结果尽快寄我部。半年时间过去了，未曾见回音，不知现在查处情况如何？望速告知。
    （此函发出至今仍无回音，特将群众来信和本报群工部的两份函文刊出，希望中共西安市委尽快将查处情况告知，以便对读者作出交待。）
