Iraq to Establish Buffer Zone in Border Areas with Iran and Turkey

	NEW DELHI, June 26 (Xinhua) -- According to a report by the Iraqi News Agency on June 26, the Iraqi government has decided to establish a buffer zone in its eastern border areas adjacent to Iran and Turkey.

	The agency quoted a statement issued by the Iraqi Embassy in London on the morning of the 26th, saying that this buffer zone will be 30 kilometers wide and 1,200 kilometers long, stretching along the borders with Iran and Turkey. Its purpose is to prevent Iraqi people in the border areas from suffering the same hardships they endured during the previous Iran-Iraq War.

	Iraqi residents living in the designated buffer zone will be collectively relocated, and each relocated family will receive compensation of several thousand dollars. Additionally, the government will allocate them land for building homes and engaging in agricultural production.

	However, the report did not specify when the plan to establish the buffer zone will be implemented.

　　在与伊朗土耳其交界地区   
    伊拉克将建立缓冲地带
    新华社巴格达６月２６日电  据伊拉克通讯社２６日报道，伊拉克政府决定将在其东部与伊朗和土耳其接壤的边境地区建立一个缓冲地带。
    这家通讯社援引伊拉克驻伦敦大使馆２６日上午发表的这项声明说，这个缓冲地带宽３０公里，总长１２００公里，与伊朗和土耳其的边界绵延相接。其目的是为了避免边界地区伊拉克人再次遭受像过去两伊战争中所受的痛苦。
    这个缓冲地带建立时，生活在这个划定的区域内的伊拉克人将集体迁移，每个迁移的家庭将得到约合数千美元的安置费。
    此外，政府还将批给他们一部分土地用于建造居舍和进行农业生产。
    但报道没有说明这一建立缓冲地带的计划将在何时开始实施。
