The "Huang-Huai-Hai Campaign" in Dezhou, Shandong Province, has achieved a significant victory. The region's 5.26 million mu (converted to actual area) of wheat has harvested a bumper crop. The yield per mu is expected to reach 300 kilograms, an increase of 30 kilograms per mu compared to last year, setting a new historical high. The total production is expected to be around 1.5 billion kilograms, an increase of over 1 billion kilograms compared to last year.

Implementing large-scale agricultural technological development has been a crucial factor in Dezhou's wheat harvest. Since last autumn, the region has undertaken or arranged nearly 2 million mu of technological development projects, including the "200,000 mu driving 1 million mu of high-yield fields" and other projects, in addition to 2.3 million mu of low-yield to medium-yield and medium-yield to high-yield development in the Huang-Huai-Hai region, covering about 80% of the region's total wheat area. The regional Science and Technology Commission and the Agricultural Bureau recently invited more than 20 agricultural experts to inspect and verify several major development projects. The results are as follows: the 200,000 mu of high-yield field technological development achieved an average yield of 430.46 kilograms per mu, an increase of 125 kilograms per mu compared to last year, a 41% increase; the 150,000 mu of precision sowing high-yield winter wheat achieved an average yield of 436.23 kilograms per mu, an increase of 26.85 kilograms per mu compared to the previous year, a 6.56% increase; more than 600,000 mu of formula fertilization wheat achieved an average yield of 413.9 kilograms per mu, an increase of 64.43 kilograms per mu compared to traditional fertilization technology, an 18.4% increase. Ling County's 300,000 mu of winter wheat high-yield technological development achieved an average yield of 442 kilograms per mu, an increase of 79.7 kilograms per mu compared to last year. Pingyuan County's 5 mu of "Lumai 8" wheat achieved a yield of 664.3 kilograms per mu, the highest in the entire region.

　　“黄淮海战役”德州告捷  全区小麦增产一亿公斤
    本报济南６月２２日电  记者宋学春报道：山东省德州地区是我国农业科技开发“黄淮海战役”的重点区，全区５２６万多亩（折实面积）小麦喜获丰收，单产可望达到３００公斤，比去年亩增３０公斤，创历史最高水平。总产可达１５亿公斤左右，比去年增产１亿多公斤。
    实行大规模的农业科技开发，是德州地区夺取小麦丰收的重要原因。去年秋种以来，该地区承担或安排了“２０万亩带动１００万亩吨粮田开发”等课题的近２００万亩科技开发，加上２３０万亩的黄淮海低产变中产、中产变高产开发，共占全区小麦总面积的８０％左右。地区科委、农业局最近邀请２０多名农业专家对几大开发项目进行了测产验收，结果是：２０万亩吨粮田技术开发，小麦平均亩产４３０．４６公斤，比去年亩增１２５公斤，增长４１％；１５万亩精播高产开发的冬小麦，平均亩产４３６．２３公斤，比上年亩增２６．８５公斤，增长６．５６％；６０多万亩配方施肥的小麦，平均亩产４１３．９公斤，比传统施肥技术亩增６４．４３公斤，增１８．４％。陵县的３万亩冬小麦高产技术开发，平均亩产４４２公斤，比去年亩增７９．７公斤。平原县的５亩“鲁麦８号”小麦，亩产高达６６４．３公斤，为全地区之冠。
