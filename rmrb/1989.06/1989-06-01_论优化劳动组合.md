In the context of socialized large-scale production, whether labor and means of production can achieve an organic combination, that is, an optimized labor combination, directly affects whether production can achieve good economic benefits and whether social productivity can develop at a faster pace. This article presents some personal views on this matter.

Labor Combination Optimization: Content and Essence

Labor combination refers to the integration of labor resources or labor conditions. Socialized large-scale production develops within a certain labor combination. Without labor combination, there would be no production or development. Generally, labor combination refers to the integration of labor and means of production. The form and scale of the integration of labor and means of production depend on the level of productive forces, which in turn directly affect the level of productive forces. An integration form and scale that match the development of productive forces can maximize the promotion of productive forces, whereas the opposite will hinder the development of productive forces.

Optimizing labor combination involves two aspects:

First, it refers to the optimization of production relations, that is, the optimization of the form of integration between labor and means of production. This is a prerequisite for the smooth progress of social reproduction. Human social reproduction always develops under a certain form of integration between means of production and labor. Optimizing labor combination means, under a certain level of productive forces, choosing a form of integration between labor and means of production that suits the development of productive forces, making production relations meet the requirements of the development of productive forces.

Second, it refers to the optimization of the quality and scale of labor in enterprises, that is, based on the quantity and technological level of means of production owned by the enterprise, choosing a suitable labor force to integrate with it, making means of production and labor organically combined. Under the condition of a certain optimization of the ownership of means of production and production relations, the optimization of the quality and scale of labor in enterprises becomes the key to the development of productive forces. The widespread and in-depth optimization of labor combination currently being carried out in China's labor system reform refers to the optimization of the quality and scale of labor. Under the condition of a certain level of productive forces, there is an objective proportional relationship between means of production and labor. This proportion is determined by the technical composition, and the quantity and quality of labor required are determined by the quantity and technological level of means of production. If an enterprise does not recruit labor according to the objectively existing quantity and technological level of means of production, but arbitrarily arranges labor, it will disrupt the proportional relationship between labor and means of production, resulting in either the idling of means of production or the idling of labor, causing a waste of social labor.

The optimization of labor combination in enterprises is a direct manifestation of the optimization of production relations. Therefore, the essence of optimizing labor combination is to achieve an organic integration of means of production and labor within the enterprise.

In the context of socialized large-scale commodity economy, enterprises, as commodity producers and operators, have independent economic interests. This objectively requires the realization of optimized labor combination to meet the economic interests of commodity producers and operators. However, in China's old economic system, what exists is precisely not an optimized labor combination. The non-optimization of labor combination is mainly manifested in three aspects: First, production relations are detached from the actual level of productive forces; second, various industries, departments, and units generally have bloated organizations, excessive personnel, misuse of materialized labor and labor, and low economic efficiency and work efficiency of enterprises; third, egalitarianism is serious, and the enthusiasm of laborers has not been fully mobilized, and the internal driving force for the development of social productive forces cannot be fully mobilized.

The non-optimization of labor combination in China is widespread in enterprises and institutions. The fundamental reason is that the labor employment mechanism has not been chosen according to the objective requirements of the development of the commodity economy. Instead of realizing the labor force owners and means of production owners' mutual free choice through the labor market's competitive mechanism, the labor force is allocated to enterprises and institutions by the administrative command of the labor force management department based on subjective will, which is a fixed employment mechanism. This makes the subjective condition of labor production—the allocation of labor resources—violate the objective law of commodity economy development. First, it violates the law of proportionally allocating social labor to various sectors of the national economy. Because the proportional allocation of social labor in the commodity economy is realized through the free choice of both producers and laborers in the labor market. Second, it violates the law of supply and demand balance. Third, it violates the law of competition. Therefore, it is necessary to reform the current fixed employment system, abolish the employment mechanism that guarantees employment for life, and establish an employment mechanism that reflects the law of competition, that is, social employment is realized through the mutual free choice of enterprises and laborers, to achieve the optimal combination of labor and means of production. Therefore, the current widespread and in-depth optimization of labor combination is a reform of the original employment system and is the establishment and improvement of a new employment system according to the objective requirements of the development of the commodity economy.

Perfecting the Mechanism for Optimizing Labor Combination

Since optimizing labor combination is an objective requirement for the full development of the commodity economy, it is not a static "optimization" but a dynamic "optimization," a process of continuously achieving optimization. The current optimization of labor combination is an action taken to address the non-optimization of labor combination in the past and is part of the reform of the original labor system. However, "optimization" should not be treated as a campaign, making a fuss for a while and then considering the "optimization" task completed. Instead, a mechanism should be established and improved to objectively achieve the continuous optimization of labor combination, maintaining the optimization of labor combination in enterprises and institutions under objective mechanisms. The main mechanisms are:

First, ensure that enterprises have independent economic interests. A basic condition for the existence and full development of the commodity economy is that commodity producers and operators have independent economic interests. Only when commodity producers and operators have independent economic interests can the commodity economy truly develop according to the requirements of the law of value. When commodity producers and operators have independent economic interests, they will naturally make their means of production and labor organically combined to maximize economic benefits. Therefore, to maintain the optimization of labor combination in social reproduction, enterprises should have the right to adjust their labor combination according to the progress of science and technology and changes in the scale of enterprise operations, keeping it in an optimized state. For labor that does not meet the development requirements of the enterprise and still does not meet the requirements after training, the enterprise has the right to dismiss them.

Second, use the competitive mechanism to achieve employment. In the commodity economy, the labor factor, as a commodity, enters the production field through the competitive mechanism in the market. As a subjective factor of commodity production, labor enters the production field through the competitive employment mechanism. The main manifestation of the full play of the competitive employment mechanism is: enterprises and labor can freely choose each other; labor can freely flow; enterprises have the right to dismiss employees who violate discipline and do not meet the requirements of technological development; enterprises and laborers establish labor relations through signing labor contracts; there is a complete technical training system for employees, and on-the-job employees are organized and purposefully trained continuously to continuously develop human resources and continuously improve the quality of laborers, so as to ensure that laborers can continuously adapt to the requirements of new industrial structure, technological structure, and product structure, and continue to maintain the optimization of the combination of labor and means of production. Only such employment can truly make both enterprises and laborers voluntary, and truly produce an optimized labor combination. If, on the one hand, labor combination optimization is to be achieved, and on the other hand, employment cannot be achieved through the competitive mechanism, labor combination optimization will become formalistic. After a period of labor combination optimization, the combination of labor and means of production is still not proportional. Therefore, in the reform of the labor system, the competitive mechanism should be fully utilized to achieve employment, and the competition should be standardized. Only in this way can the labor combination be continuously optimized.

Third, a complete technical training system. In socialized large-scale production, with the progress of science and technology and the updating of knowledge, the industrial structure, technological structure, and product structure of social production will undergo corresponding changes, which in turn will cause changes in the employment structure. This objectively determines that the labor force within the enterprise and throughout the society needs to flow frequently, and the enterprise and society must have a complete technical training system for employees. Only in this way can the labor combination be truly kept in an optimized state.

Fourth, the technical requirements of labor posts, promotion assessment standards, and labor remuneration standards are serialized and publicized. In the commodity economy, the optimized labor combination requires enterprises to have clear technical requirements for each type of work, process, and technology, and clear regulations for the promotion assessment of employees and the labor remuneration for each type of work and position, and to fully publicize them to employees, so that employees can decide which economic organization to work for based on technical requirements and labor remuneration, and enterprises can recruit laborers according to their own required labor structure and labor quality.

Fifth, a complete social security system. In the commodity economy, the supply and demand of labor force in enterprises can only be balanced to achieve the optimization of labor combination. This inevitably will have the existence of unemployed people. The existence of unemployed people, for the adjustment of the supply and demand of labor force in the development of the commodity economy, for forcing the employed to strive to improve their labor quality, and for promoting the development of social productive forces, has a certain role. But society should also provide necessary living guarantees for the unemployed, that is, provide unemployment relief. Only in this way can both the labor productivity and work efficiency of enterprises and institutions be continuously improved, and social stability and unity be maintained, keeping the labor combination in enterprises always in an optimized state.

Sixth, a complete legal mechanism to protect the normal operation of the commodity economy order. The fundamental driving force for the full development of the commodity economy is to establish a good and harmonious credit relationship between commodity producers and operators, between commodity production and management personnel and direct laborers, and between production laborers. Once this relationship is established, it needs to be protected, and when this relationship encounters contradictions, it needs to be adjusted in a timely and fair manner, which requires the establishment of a complete legal system to protect and adjust commodity economic relations. Optimizing labor combination is an important link in the commodity economic order and is an indispensable economic activity in the process of commodity economic development. In this link, it is also necessary to use laws to protect its normal activities. For example, in the process of optimization, if the commodity producer and operator unfairly reduces the labor force, causing unemployment, and labor disputes occur, the laborer has the right to use legal means to protect his labor rights; if the laborer is indeed not suitable for the needs of the enterprise and is dismissed after going through the legal procedures, and causes trouble unreasonably due to unemployment, the enterprise manager and society have the right to impose sanctions according to legal regulations.

　　论优化劳动组合
    王永江
    在社会化大生产中，劳动力与生产资料能否实现有机组合，即优化的劳动组合，直接关系到生产能否取得较好的经济效益，关系到社会生产力能否以较快的速度发展。本文对此提出一些自己的看法。
    　　　　劳动组合优化的内涵及实质
    劳动组合是劳动资源或劳动条件的结合。社会化大生产是在一定的劳动组合中发展的。没有劳动组合也就没有生产及其发展。一般讲的劳动组合是指劳动力与生产资料的结合。劳动力与生产资料的结合的形式和规模，取决于生产力发展水平，又直接影响生产力的发展水平。适合生产力发展的结合形式和规模，能最大限度地促进生产力发展，反之则阻碍生产力的发展。
    优化劳动组合包含两层含义：
    第一层，是指生产关系的优化，即劳动力与生产资料结合形式的优化，这是社会再生产得以顺利进行的前提条件。人类社会再生产，总是在一定的生产资料与劳动力结合的形式下发展的。优化劳动组合就是要在一定的生产力水平下，选择适合生产力发展的劳动力与生产资料结合形式，使生产关系适合生产力发展的要求。
    第二层，是指企业劳动力素质和规模的优化，即根据本企业所拥有的生产资料数量和技术水平，选择相适应的劳动力与之相结合，使生产资料和劳动力有机结合。在生产资料所有制、生产关系的优化组合一定条件下，企业的劳动力素质和规模的优化，就成为生产力发展的关键。当前我国在劳动制度改革中所广泛而深入开展的优化劳动组合，就是指劳动力素质和规模的优化。在生产力水平一定条件下，生产资料与劳动力之间在客观上是存在一定比例关系的。这种比例是由技术构成决定的，所需劳动力的数量和素质是由生产资料的数量和技术水平决定的。如果一个企业不按客观存在的生产资料数量和技术水平招收劳动力，而是任意地安排劳动力，那么就会破坏劳动力与生产资料的比例关系，就会造成或者是生产资料的闲置不用，或者是劳动力的闲置不用，造成社会劳动的浪费。
    企业劳动组合优化是生产关系优化的直接体现。因此，劳动组合优化的实质是在企业中实现生产资料与劳动力的有机结合。
    在社会化大生产的商品经济中，企业作为商品生产经营者，具有独立的经济利益。这就在客观上要求实现劳动组合的优化，以实现商品生产经营者的经济利益要求。但是，在我国的旧经济体制中，普遍存在的恰恰不是优化的劳动组合。劳动组合不优化主要表现在三个方面：第一，生产关系脱离现实的生产力发展水平；第二，社会各行业各部门各单位普遍存在机构臃肿、人浮于事、物化劳动和劳动力被滥用、企业经济效益和办事效率低等现象；第三，平均主义严重，劳动者的积极性没有充分发挥出来，社会生产力发展的内在动力不能充分地发动起来。
    我国劳动组合这种不优化的表现是普遍存在于企事业单位中的，其根本原因是没有按照商品经济发展的客观要求选择劳动就业机制，不是通过劳动市场的竞争机制实现劳动力所有者和生产资料所有者双向的自由选择，而是由社会劳动力的主管部门凭主观意志行政命令式地分配劳动力于企事业中，是统包统配的就业机制。这就使得劳动力不是按照社会经济发展需要供给，而是按照实际上自发形成的劳动力人口强行地摊派到企事业中，使得劳动生产的主观条件——劳动力资源的分配，违背商品经济发展的客观规律。第一，违背了按比例分配社会劳动力于国民经济各部门的规律。因为商品经济中的按比例分配社会劳动力是通过劳动市场上生产资料所有者与劳动力所有者的双方自由选择实现的。第二，违背了供给与需求相平衡的规律。第三，违背了竞争规律。因此，必须改革现行的固定工用工制度，废除那种统包统配一定终生的就业机制，建立体现竞争规律的就业机制，即社会就业通过企事业单位和劳动者双向自由选择实现，以实现劳动力与生产资料的最优结合。因此，现在广泛而深入进行的优化劳动组合，是对原有用工制度的改革，是按照商品经济发展的客观要求建立和完善新的用工制度。
    　　　　完善劳动组合优化机制
    优化劳动组合既然是商品经济充分发展的客观要求，它就不是一种静态的“优化”，而是动态的“优化”，是不断实现优化的过程。当前进行的优化劳动组合，是针对过去劳动组合不优化而采取的行动，是对原有劳动制度改革的一部分内容。但不能把“优化”当作运动来搞，热闹一阵，就算完成了“优化”任务。而是要建立健全在客观上实现劳动组合不断进行优化的机制，在客观机制制约下，保持企事业劳动组合的优化。其机制主要有：
    第一，确保企业具有独立的经济利益。商品经济存在并能充分发展的一个基本条件就是商品生产经营者具有独立的经济利益。只有商品生产经营者具有独立的经济利益，商品经济才能真正按照价值规律的要求发展。在商品生产经营者具有独立经济利益时，商品生产经营者自然要使自己的生产资料与劳动力有机结合，最大限度地实现经济效益。所以，要保持社会再生产中企业劳动组合的优化，企业就要有权依据科学技术的进步、企业经营规模的变化，调整自己的劳动组合，使之始终处于优化状态。对于不适合本企业发展要求的劳动力，经过培训仍达不到要求时，有权予以辞退。
    第二，运用竞争机制实现就业。在商品经济中，劳动要素是作为商品在市场上通过竞争机制进入生产领域的，作为商品生产的主观要素劳动力，是通过竞争就业机制进入生产领域的。竞争就业机制充分发挥作用的主要表现是：企业和劳动力可以自由地双向选择；劳动力可以自由流动；企业有权辞退违纪和不适应生产技术发展要求的职工；企业与劳动者通过签订劳动合同建立劳动关系；对就业者有完善的技术培训制度，对在职职工有组织有目的地不断进行技术培训，不断进行人力资源开发，不断提高劳动者的素质，以保障劳动者能不断适应新的产业结构、技术结构、产品结构的要求，继续保持劳动力与生产资料组合的优化。只有这样的就业，企业和劳动者双方才真正是自愿的，才能真正产生优化的劳动组合。如果一方面想要实现劳动组合优化，一方面又不能通过竞争机制实现就业，优化劳动组合也就会流于形式。优化劳动组合热闹一阵后劳动力与生产资料结合依旧是不能按比例结合。所以，在劳动制度改革中，要让竞争机制在实现就业方面充分发挥作用，要使竞争规范化。只有这样，才能保持劳动组合始终优化。
    第三，完善的技术培训制度。在社会化大生产中，随着科学技术进步和知识更新，社会生产的产业结构、技术结构、产品结构都会发生相应的变化，从而引起就业结构的变化。这就在客观上决定了企业内部以及全社会的劳动力是需要经常流动的，决定了企业和社会必须对就业者有完善的技术培训制度。只有这样，才能真正保持劳动组合始终处于优化状态。
    第四，劳动岗位的技术要求、晋级考核标准和劳动报酬标准系列化、公开化。在商品经济中优化的劳动组合，要求企业对自己的每个工种工序工艺，都有明确的技术要求，对职工的晋级考核标准和对每个工种、职务的劳动报酬也都有明确的规定，并向就业者全部公开，以使就业者根据技术要求和劳动报酬决定自己究竟到什么样的经济组织就业，企业则按自己所需要的劳动力结构、劳动力素质招用劳动者。
    第五，完善的社会保障制度。在商品经济中，企业的劳动力供给量与需求量相平衡才能实现劳动组合的优化。这就不可避免地会有失业者存在。失业者的存在，对于调节商品经济发展中的劳动力供求，对于迫使在业者努力提高自己的劳动力素质，对于促进社会生产力的发展是有一定的作用的。但社会也应当对失业者必须提供必要的生活保障，也就是要给予失业救济。只有这样，才能既保障企（事）业单位劳动生产率和工作效率不断提高，又保障社会安定团结，保持企业劳动组合始终处于优化状态。
    第六，完善保护商品经济秩序正常运行的法律机制。商品经济充分发展的根本动力是在商品生产经营者之间、在商品生产经营管理者和直接劳动者之间、在生产劳动者之间建立起良好和谐的信誉关系，这种关系一旦建立就需要予以保护，当这种关系发生矛盾时就需及时予以公正调节，这就需要建立完善的保护和调节商品经济关系的法律。优化劳动组合，是商品经济秩序中的一个重要环节，也是商品经济发展过程中必不可少的经济活动。在这个环节上，同样需要运用法律予以保护其正常活动。比如在优化过程中，如因商品生产经营者不公正地裁减了劳动者使之失业，发生了劳动争议，劳动者有权运用法律手段保护自己的劳动权利；如果确系不适应本企（事）业单位需要，经过法定的手续办理辞退的劳动者，因失业而无理取闹，企（事）业管理者和社会有权依据法律规定予以制裁。
