    If there are one hundred failures, there will be one hundred and one resurrections. This is the strong person's response to failure.
    Even if one cannot become a respectable winner, one should strive to be a tenacious loser. This is also glorious—if you have given your all.
    Being intoxicated by glory and being numb to failure are equally the misfortunes of the weak.
    Those who are strong in their pursuits will not waver from their set goals in any situation. Those who abandon their goals, their goals will also abandon them.
    Without the courage to overwhelm the opponent in spirit, even an easily attainable victory may be lost.

    有一百次失败便有一百零一次崛起，这就是强者面对失败的回答。
    即使不能成为可敬的胜利者，也要成为顽强的失败者，它同样光荣——如果你已竭尽了全力。
    醉倒在荣誉里和麻木在失败中一样，都是弱者的不幸。
    事业的强者在任何情况下都不会动摇既定的目标，放弃目标的人，目标也放弃他。
    没有在精神上压倒对方的勇气，唾手可得的胜利也可能丢失。
