A few years ago, the Shaanxi Yongcheng Archaeological Team, Baoji City Archaeological Team, and Long County Museum collaborated to excavate and clean 29 tombs of the Spring and Autumn Period, belonging to high-ranking officials and clan members, in Long County's Edge Village. Among the numerous artifacts unearthed, the most controversial, numerous, and enigmatic were a type of clay thin pieces with a hook shape and a hole.

The discovery of this artifact attracted many experts and scholars to Long County for investigation. Up to now, the conclusions drawn are: horse ornaments, funeral vessels, and clay chimes. Regarding this, Mr. Hu Baichuan, after reviewing a large amount of literature and conducting repeated research, believes that the Edge Village artifacts are neither horse ornaments, nor funeral vessels, nor clay chimes, but rather a type of currency from the Spring and Autumn Period in the state of Qin—bridge-shaped clay coins.

He believes that, first of all, bridge-shaped horse ornaments have been unearthed in the south, made of copper with holes and thin, curved pieces, and with fine raised patterns. The artifacts unearthed in Edge Village, however, are hook-shaped, gray clay pieces with holes, which are fundamentally different from the former and are not suitable to be used as horse ornaments. Furthermore, in the 800 years of the Zhou Dynasty, there has never been a precedent of using clay as horse ornaments. Secondly, the theory of casting funeral vessels also seems to be unfounded. Because it is unclear whether it is a ceremonial vessel or a sacrificial vessel, and what symbolic meaning it represents. Thirdly, ancient stone chimes are percussion instruments that are struck in combination, and should have differences in size and thickness to produce different pitches. The artifacts unearthed in Edge Village, however, are uniform in shape and form, and striking them individually does not produce different pitches, so the theory of clay chimes cannot stand.

Finally, based on his research on early Qin currency, Hu Baichuan reviewed relevant literature and deeply investigated the social conditions of the early Pre-Qin period, concluding that bridge-shaped clay coins were early Pre-Qin currency.

Mr. Hu also believes that using clay as currency is not an isolated case. During the Zhou Dynasty, there were instances of clay currency, which is listed as the fourth category of Zhou currency in the "Chinese Coinage General Survey."

### 对边家庄墓葬有新认识  陶质薄片为先秦货币

　　对边家庄墓葬有新认识
    陶质薄片为先秦货币
    本报讯  前几年，陕西雍城考古队、宝鸡市考古队和陇县博物馆一起，在陕西陇县边家庄，发掘清理了２９座春秋先秦大夫级和族人的墓葬。在数目众多的出土物中争议最大、数量最多、罕见而又无法定名的，是一种拐形有孔的陶质薄片。
    这一器物的出土，引起不少专家学者来陇考查。迄至目前所得出的结论是：马饰、冥器、陶磬。对此，胡百川先生翻阅了大量资料，经过反复研究后认为，边家庄出土物一非马饰，二非冥器，三非陶磬，而应是春秋时期秦国货币之一——桥形陶钱。
    他认为，首先，南方出土过桥形马饰，为铜质带孔拐弯薄片，并上有凸起细微的纹饰。而边家庄出土物为拐形带孔灰色陶片，与前者相比根本不是同一类物，是不宜作为马饰的，并且在周代８００余年中，从未见过以陶质作为马饰的先例。其次，专铸冥器一说也似为妄议。因为它是作为礼器还是祭器，象征意义是什么，均难以解释。再次，古代石磬为伴奏连击的组合乐器，应有大小厚薄之别，经敲击才能发出高低音阶。而边家庄出土物形质统一，造形雷同，逐一敲击也难以发出高低不同的音来，陶磬一说自然不能成立。最后，胡百川先生根据对秦国早期货币的研究，查考了有关文献资料，并深入先秦早期的社会状况后得出结论：桥形陶钱为先秦早期货币。
    胡先生还认为，以陶质作币，并非孤例，周代就有过陶币出现，《中国钱币通考》列为第四类周币进行论述。
