	Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, June 4 – Tehran Radio broadcast this morning that Iran's religious leader Ruhollah Khomeini passed away last night in a hospital here.

	Khomeini underwent surgery on May 23 due to gastrointestinal bleeding. His condition worsened on June 3.

	The Iranian government issued a statement today announcing a 40-day national mourning period.

	Khomeini was born in 1902 in a small town 260 kilometers southwest of Tehran to a Muslim clerical family. He began his political struggle against Iran's King Pahlavi in 1962, was imprisoned, and later went into exile abroad. After the 1979 Iranian Islamic Revolution, Khomeini returned to the country and became its supreme leader.
