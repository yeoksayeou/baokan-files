Since the newspaper launched a discussion on how to break through agricultural stagnation, many experts and scholars have written articles, expressing their views frankly. At the same time, officials, soldiers, teachers, and students who call themselves "outsiders" have also actively offered their opinions and suggestions. Although their views are not systematic, the content is broad and practical, and should not be ignored.

Implement Protective Policies to Mobilize Farmers' Enthusiasm

Agricultural development relies on "three factors": the first is policy. Many letters also focus on the issue of agricultural policy in China.

Liu Zhaoming, a teacher at Sichuan Chongqing Education Institute, raised the issue of changing agricultural policies. He said that, looking at the agricultural policies of various countries around the world, they can be divided into two types: protective and discriminatory. The former provides economic support for agriculture, while the latter economically plunders agriculture. Liu Zhaoming believes that the long-term stable development of China's agriculture depends on policy changes, specifically including a series of policies such as price protection, production protection, and management protection.

To develop agriculture, it is necessary to fully mobilize the enthusiasm of farmers. Where does the enthusiasm of farmers come from? He Yongbin of the Propaganda Department of Jingshan County, Hubei Province, said that farmers are the "source" of grain production. To open up and strengthen the flow, the first step is to make farmers independent commodity producers who have both production autonomy and management autonomy. Xu Dongping of the Air Force Command Academy believes that why is agriculture stagnating? Why can't grain production increase? The problem is very simple: grain prices are low, and it is not profitable to grow grain, so no effort is put into it.

Establish Agricultural Mainstay and Improve Farmers' Quality

Zhang Mingqiong, a graduate student at Renmin University of China, wrote an article analyzing the reasons for agricultural stagnation. He believes that in addition to policy issues, efforts should be made to help farmers improve their quality.

Farmers are the mainstay of agricultural production. However, among China's population, 1/4 of the illiterates are mostly farmers. Yuan Shenghai of Hejiang Middle School in Huazhou County, Guangdong Province, said that batch after batch of farmers with relatively high quality have gone to work or do business, and the quality of those who farm is getting worse. Many are only satisfied with being able to plant and harvest, and there is no talk of scientific farming and fine management.

Perhaps what is even more worrying is the next generation of farmers. Liu Yun of the Second Design Institute of the Ministry of Railways believes that the willingness of rural youth to farm is increasingly declining, which has become the biggest crisis facing agricultural development. A survey of students at a certain agricultural school in Shanghai found that only 2% of the students were willing to engage in agricultural production.

Du Guiwen, a teacher at Yanwo High School in Honghu, Hubei Province, wrote in a letter that to break through agricultural stagnation, one must "treat the root cause," and the root cause is people, specifically farmers. In today's emphasis on agricultural technology, if farmers' quality does not improve, agriculture will be difficult to develop.

Xia Jianhai of Tianjin Normal University also mentioned the quality of rural cadres in his article. He said that at present, rural cadres in many regions of China are far from meeting the requirements. Some rural cadres do not even understand the most basic laws and policies and cannot play a leading role. However, in places where agricultural production is good, the quality of grassroots cadres is generally also high.

Strengthen Service Awareness and Establish a Service System

To adapt to the new situation of agricultural economic development, it is necessary to establish a multi-level and multi-form social service network. This is the appeal of Liu Xianzong of the Propaganda Department of Zhao County, Hebei Province. He believes that strengthening socialized services is to grasp the most concerned issues of farmers and the most urgent problems to be solved in rural development.

He Songxin of the Science and Technology Commission of Luoding County, Guangdong Province, mentioned in his letter that to do a good job in agricultural production, the entire process from pre-production, in-production, to post-production needs to be strengthened in service. For example, pre-production includes the implementation of contracts, agricultural land construction, the introduction and promotion of good seeds, and the organization and transportation of pesticides and fertilizers; in-production includes disease and pest control, field management, and technical guidance; post-production includes product sales and financial guarantees, etc. However, at present, the "service" in most places is still only limited to urging plowing and sowing. Relevant functional departments have also relaxed their services due to overemphasis on economic benefits.

Xie Shicheng, a teacher at Huayingshan Mining Bureau No. 1 Middle School in Sichuan Province, suggested organizing non-operating land farmers to establish a service system for farmers' needs before, during, and after production.

Accelerate the Transformation of Achievements and Play the Role of Scientific and Technological Potential

According to China's national conditions, the first thing to find in agricultural development is not a substitute for labor, but a substitute for land. The main role of agricultural mechanization is to replace labor. In the context of limited arable land resources in China, the role of mechanization in improving land productivity and feed reward rate is far less obvious than the promotion of agricultural technology. Based on this, many comrades advocate for fully tapping into scientific and technological potential to improve the quality and yield of agricultural products with advanced technology.

Wang Jian of Kaiping Mining Bureau suggested strengthening the basic research of agricultural science. On the one hand, accelerate the research and experimentation of high-yield grain crops suitable for China's production conditions; on the other hand, actively introduce and promote high-quality grain varieties from abroad. Some high-altitude regions in China are vast and are considered "barren land," but in fact, they are similar to the natural conditions of North America. If attention is paid to introducing advanced agricultural technology and excellent varieties, and developing these regions, the benefits will be considerable.

Perfect the Contract Responsibility System and Speed Up Land Reform

The reform of the rural land system is a relatively hot topic in the discussion. Lecturer Pu Xiaojin of the Military Technical Academy proposed the development of a multi-level long-term land lease system. The specific steps are: from contract to lease—change the contract to lease; from short to long—change short-term contracts to long-term leases; from few to many—change the single contract form based on households to collective leasing, professional leasing, joint leasing, and individual leasing by farmers.

The theme of Li Zhihong's letter from the Office of Zhangbei County Government, Hebei Province, is to implement "land consolidation." He believes that the key to solving the problem of insufficient momentum in agriculture lies in breaking the small-scale agricultural production mode and gradually implementing large-scale management of arable land. With the development of the secondary and tertiary industries, those who are good at farming can obtain more arable land. As a result, rural labor will be further differentiated, and production factors will be optimized. Of course, this is a long process, and rushing is not good.

专栏：怎样突破徘徊？——农业发展问题讨论

　　“局外人”谈“徘徊”    
    ——各界人士来稿综述
    许宝健
    本报开展如何突破农业徘徊的讨论以来，许多专家、学者纷纷撰稿，坦陈己见；同时，自称为“局外人”的机关干部、军人、教师、学生等也踊跃提出意见，献计献策。他们的意见虽不算系统，但内容广泛、实在，不应忽视。
    实行保护性政策　调动农民积极性
    发展农业有“三靠”，第一就是靠政策。许多来稿也把问题集中在我国的农业政策上。
    四川重庆教育学院刘朝明老师提出转变农业政策的问题。他说，纵观世界各国的农业政策，可分为保护性和歧视性两类。前者对农业实行经济上的资助，后者对农业实行经济上的剥夺。刘朝明认为，我国农业的长期稳定发展取决于政策转变，具体包括：价格保护、生产保护、经营保护等一系列政策。
    农业要上去，必须充分调动农民的积极性。农民的积极性从何而来？湖北省京山县委宣传部何永斌说，农民是粮食生产的“源头”，开源壮流，首先要让农民成为既有生产自主权、又有经营自主权的独立的商品生产者。空军指挥学院徐东平认为，农业为什么徘徊？粮食为什么上不去？问题再简单不过，粮价低，种粮不赚钱，就不在上面下功夫。
    确立农业主体　提高农民素质
    中国人民大学研究生张明琼撰文分析了农业陷入徘徊的原因。他认为，除了政策等原因外，还应下大力帮助农民提高素质。
    农民是农业生产的主体。然而，占我国人口１／４的文盲绝大部分是农民。广东化州县合江中学的袁胜海说，一批批素质较高的农民务工、经商去了，种田人的素质越来越差。有不少只满足于种得下、收得起，根本谈不上科学种田，精耕管理。
    也许，更令人忧虑的是下一代农民。铁道部第二设计院的刘云认为，农村中的青少年务农意愿日益低落，已成为农业发展所面临的最大危机。上海市某农业学校对在校学生搞了一次志愿调查，结果愿意从事农业生产的学生只占２％。
    湖北洪湖燕窝高中教师杜贵汶在来信中写道，突破农业徘徊要“治本”，本就是人，就是农民。在强调科技兴农的今天，农民素质不提高，农业很难上去。
    天津师大的夏建海的文稿中还提到了农村干部的素质问题。他说，目前我国许多地区农村干部远不能适应要求。一些农村干部连最基本的法规和政策都不懂，根本起不到领导作用。而农业生产搞得好的地方，基层干部的素质一般也都比较高。
    增强服务观念　建立服务体系
    为适应农业经济发展的新形势，必须建立多层次、多形式的社会服务网络。这是河北省赵县宣传部刘先宗的呼吁。他认为，加强社会化服务，就是抓住了当前农民最关心和农村发展中最急需解决的问题。
    广东省罗定县科委何松新在来稿中谈到，要搞好农业生产，产前、产中、产后全过程都要加强服务。如产前的落实承包、农田基本建设、良种的引进推广、农药肥料的组织调运；产中的病虫防治、田间管理、技术指导；产后的产品销售、资金保证等等。可是，目前大多数地方的“服务”，还仅停留在催耕催种上。有关职能部门也由于过份强调经济效益而放松了服务。
    四川省华蓥山矿务局一中谢仕聪老师建议，组织非经营土地农户，建立农民所需的产前、产中及产后的服务系统。
    加速成果转化　发挥科技潜力
    根据我国国情，农业发展首先要寻找的是土地替代品，而不是劳力替代品。而农业机械化的主要作用是替代劳动力。在我国耕地资源有限的情况下机械化对提高土地生产率、饲料报酬率的作用，远没有农业科技推广明显。据此，许多同志主张大挖科技潜力，用先进技术提高农产品质量和产量。
    开滦矿务局王俭建议要加强农业基础科学研究。一方面加快研究、试验适应我国生产条件的高产粮食作物品种；另一方面要积极引进推广国外优质粮种。我国某些高寒地区地域广阔，被视为“不毛之地”，其实与北美自然条件类似。如果注意引进先进的农业技术、优良品种，开垦和发展这些地区，效益是可观的。
    完善承包制度　加快土地改革
    农村土地制度改革是讨论中一个比较热的话题。解放军技术学院讲师濮小金提出，要发展多层次长期土地租赁制。具体步骤为：由包到租——变承包为租赁；由短到长——变短期承包为长期租赁；由少到多——变以户为单位的单一承包形式为集体租赁、专业租赁、联户租赁和农户个体租赁等。
    实行“耕地兼并”，是河北省张北县政府办公室李志宏来稿的主题。他认为，解决农业后劲不足的问题，关键在于打破小农经济生产方式，逐步实行耕地的规模经营。随着第二、三产业的发展，那些种田能手可以得到更多耕地。其结果，农村劳力将进一步分化，生产要素得到优化组合。当然这是一个长过程，急了不行。
