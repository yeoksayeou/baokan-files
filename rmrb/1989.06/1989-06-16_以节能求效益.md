Title: Seeking Efficiency Through Energy Conservation

The energy gap in China is significant this year, yet energy waste remains alarmingly high. This is a matter that deserves serious attention.

Whether the national economy can maintain a steady pace of development to a significant extent depends on the energy supply situation. Improving and ensuring the energy supply involves two main strategies: increasing supply and conserving energy. Increasing supply, such as expanding coal and electricity production, requires substantial funds and a relatively long construction period. On the other hand, conserving energy can often be achieved without significant financial investment, such as improving enterprise management to eliminate waste. Some measures, like updating equipment and improving production processes, do require investment, but they are generally more cost-effective.

In recent years, the State Council and relevant departments have issued 17 energy conservation regulations, including the Interim Provisions on Energy Conservation Management, which have played a role in strengthening energy management and reducing energy consumption. However, overall, people's awareness of energy conservation is still weak, and the implementation of existing energy conservation laws and regulations is not rigorous. The high-energy-consuming equipment and outdated technologies listed in the interim regulations on energy conservation have not been effectively controlled. Boilers and old vehicles that are ordered to be phased out have not been scrapped and are instead being transferred to township enterprises. High-energy-consuming small condensing power plants, diesel generators, and small-scale coking operations are still in development. Therefore, efforts must be made to promote energy conservation education and launch activities to establish energy-efficient factories, industries, and cities. This will enhance people's awareness of energy conservation and achieve efficiency through conservation. At the same time, it is necessary to continue establishing and improving energy conservation laws, urgently formulate a batch of urgently needed energy conservation regulations, and improve the practical content of various energy conservation regulations.

Formulating regulations is important, but more importantly, these regulations must be implemented. The idea that publishing a regulation means "completing the task" is harmful and unhelpful. The authorities should regularly monitor the implementation of energy conservation regulations and policies, strengthen supervision and inspection, and promptly address any issues that arise. Banks, tax authorities, and industrial and commercial administrative departments should also actively cooperate with the energy conservation authorities to ensure effective enforcement of energy conservation laws.

### 以节能求效益

　　以节能求效益
    今年，我国能源缺口大，而能耗的浪费仍很惊人，这是值得重视的。
    国民经济能否保持一定速度稳步发展，很大程度取决于能源供应状况如何。改善和保证能源供应，一靠开源，二靠节约。开源，扩大煤炭、电力生产，既需大量资金，又需较长的建设周期。而节约使用能源，有些是不用花多少钱的，如改善企业管理，杜绝浪费；有些如更新设备，改进生产工艺，也需要投入一些资金，相比之下，投资省，效果好。
    近几年来，国务院和有关部门颁发了节约能源管理暂行条例等１７个节能法规，对强化用能管理，降低能源消耗，起了一定作用。但总的来说，人们的节能意识还很淡薄，对现行节能法规、制度贯彻执行不力。有关节能的暂行条例、暂行规定所列举的高耗能设备、落后工艺，至今未得到有效控制；明令淘汰的低效锅炉、老旧汽车等未作报废处理，大量地向乡镇企业转移；能耗颇高的凝汽式小火电、柴油发电、小土炼焦等还在继续发展。所以，要下气力抓节能教育，开展建立节能工厂、节能行业、节能城市的活动，提高人们节能的自觉性，以节能求效益。同时，要继续建立健全节能法制，抓紧制订一批急需的节能法规，抓紧完善各种节能法规的实际内容。
    制定法规是重要的，更重要的是将法规贯彻执行下去。那种以为法规一旦公布就算“完成任务”的思想，是有害无益的。主管部门要经常了解节能法规、制度的执行情况，加强督促检查，发现问题及时解决。银行、税务、工商行政管理等部门，也要积极配合节能主管部门，搞好节能执法工作。
