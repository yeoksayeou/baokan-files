The General Administration of Customs and the Ministry of Public Security, with the approval of the State Council, issued the "Regulations on the Use of Weapons and Equipment by Customs Officers" on June 19.

It states that when customs officers are on anti-smuggling missions and encounter situations such as pursuing fleeing smuggling gangs, facing armed smuggling protection, smugglers or suspected smugglers resisting inspection with violence, snatching weapons or equipment, threatening the lives of customs officers, or smugglers or suspected smugglers using violence to seize seized smuggled goods, items, and other evidence, they may open fire if it cannot be stopped otherwise.
