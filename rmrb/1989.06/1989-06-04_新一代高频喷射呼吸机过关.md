Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, June 4th.

A new generation of high-frequency jet ventilators, designed for the treatment of lung diseases, has been successfully developed by Professor Cao Yong of the First Affiliated Hospital of Jiangxi Medical College. It recently passed an inspection.

Clinical applications involving tens of thousands of cases have shown that many hospitals currently use high-frequency jet ventilators that can effectively remove carbon dioxide from most patients with normal lungs. However, for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, there can sometimes be difficulties in expelling carbon dioxide. Professor Cao Yong has improved the current high-frequency jet ventilators. Clinical trials involving more than 160 cases across five hospitals have proven that this new ventilator effectively addresses the issue of carbon dioxide accumulation during high-frequency ventilation.

　　新一代高频喷射呼吸机过关
    据新华社南昌六月四日电（记者卢晶）用于治疗肺病的新一代高频喷射呼吸机，由江西医学院第一附属医院曹勇教授研制成功，并于最近通过了鉴定。
    数以万例的临床应用表明，目前许多医院使用的高频喷射呼吸机，对于大多数有正常肺的病人的二氧化碳的排除并无困难，但对于慢性阻塞性肺疾患者，有时会出现二氧化碳排出障碍。曹勇教授对目前使用的高频喷射呼吸机加以改进，经五个医院一百六十余例临床应用证明：它较好地解决了高频通气中存在的二氧化碳蓄积的问题。
