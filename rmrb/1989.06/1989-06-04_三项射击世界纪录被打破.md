Three shooting world records were broken at the Munich World Cup shooting competition today, which concluded after four days of rain-soaked events. Soviet shooter Ivanov set a new world record in the 3x40 rifle event with a score of 1,178 points, surpassing the previous record held by American Foth by 11 points. Ivanov also broke his compatriot Petlyan's record, set just eight days ago, with a score of 1,276.6 points in the final. Ralph Schumann, the Olympic silver medalist in rapid-fire pistol and European champion from the German Democratic Republic, broke the world record set last week by Swiss shooter Kuchler with a final score of 792 points.

Chinese athletes did not perform well, with the best result being eighth place in the rapid-fire pistol event.
