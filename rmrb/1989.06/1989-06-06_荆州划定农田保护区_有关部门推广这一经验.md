Farmers in Jingzhou, Hubei Province, praise the designation of basic agricultural land protection zones as a "meritorious deed" that ensures "a bowl of rice for future generations."

From May 25 to 28, the Ministry of Agriculture and the State Land Administration held a field meeting in the ancient city of Jingzhou to promote the experience of designating basic agricultural land protection zones in the Jingzhou region.

Statistics show that China's per capita arable land has decreased from 2.7 mu (approximately 1.8 acres) 40 years ago to the current 1.38 mu (approximately 0.92 acres), which is less than one-third of the world average. More alarmingly, while the population continues to grow, arable land is decreasing at a rate of several million mu per year. Facing these grim facts, authorities warn that China's arable land capacity has reached a critical state.

Leaders in the Jingzhou region are more aware of this problem. Over the past year, while ensuring other construction land needs, they have successively designated more than 2,100 basic agricultural land protection zones, covering an area of 11 million mu, bringing 85% of the region's arable land under protection. Local governments have issued protection notices, and towns and villages have formulated local regulations and customs, prohibiting any non-agricultural construction or arbitrary changes in land use within the protection zones. The designation of these protection zones has effectively curbed the trend of arbitrarily occupying and misusing arable land. In 1988, the phenomenon of arbitrarily occupying arable land in the Jingzhou region decreased by 96% compared to the previous year. The designation of protection zones has also protected large areas of farmland, enhancing farmers' enthusiasm for investing in land.

According to the meeting's arrangements, in the second half of this year, all provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions across the country will begin pilot projects for agricultural land protection zones.

　　荆州划定农田保护区
    有关部门推广这一经验
    本报武汉电  记者龚达发报道：湖北省荆州地区农民评价划定基本农田保护区是“为子孙留下了饭碗”的“功德无量”的好事。
    ５月２５日至２８日，农业部、国家土地局在古城荆州召开现场会，推广荆州地区划定基本农田保护区工作经验。
    资料表明，我国人均占有耕地已由４０年前的２．７亩，下降到目前１．３８亩，不及世界人均地的１／３；更令人不安的是，在人口不断增长的同时，耕地却以每年数百万亩的速度减少。面对严峻的事实，权威人士警告说，我国耕地的人口承载力已到临界状态。
    荆州地区的领导者比较清醒地意识到这一问题。去年以来，他们在安排好其他建设用地同时，先后划定了２１００多个基本农田保护区，面积达１１００万亩，把全区现有８５％的耕地纳入保护范围。当地政府发布保护布告，乡、村制订乡规民约，任何人不能在保护区进行非农业建设，不能任意改变耕地用途。保护区的划定，使乱占滥用耕地的歪风得到有效控制。１９８８年，荆州地区乱占耕地现象比上年减少９６％。划定保护区使大片农田受到法规保护，增强了农民对土地投入的积极性。
    根据会议部署，今年下半年全国各省、市、自治区将开始农田保护区的试点工作。
