After several days of looting in many cities, the situation in Argentina began to stabilize starting from June 1. No serious disturbances occurred.

A week earlier, the second-largest city, Cordoba, saw the first incidents of looting in supermarkets and food stores. Similar events followed in the third-largest city, Rosario, and the areas around the capital, Buenos Aires. The most severe incidents occurred in Rosario, where over 170 stores were looted in just two days, May 28 and 29.

In response to the social unrest, the Argentine government declared a nationwide state of siege for 30 days on May 29 and deployed police forces to strengthen security and patrols in some cities.

In the past few days, various levels of the Argentine government have cooperated with the business sector to provide free or discounted food and other daily necessities to low-income groups. On May 31, the incumbent President Alfonsín and the elected President Menem held an emergency meeting to discuss the current domestic situation and agreed on several specific measures.

Observers believe that these actions have to some extent helped to stabilize public sentiment and ease the tense situation.

　　阿根廷形势趋平静
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯电  连续几天在许多城市发生哄抢超级市场和食品商店的事件之后，从６月１日起，阿根廷各地形势趋于平静，没有发生严重的骚乱。
    一个星期前，在阿根廷第二大城科尔多瓦首先发生哄抢超级市场和食品店的事件。接着在第三大城罗萨里奥及首都布宜诺斯艾利斯附近地区也发生类似事件，其中较严重的是罗萨里奥市，仅５月２８日和２９日两天，就有１７０多家商店遭到抢劫。
    面对这种社会动乱，阿根廷政府５月２９日宣布全国戒严３０天，并出动警察部队在一些城市加强戒备和巡逻。
    几天来，阿根廷各级政府同企业界合作，向一些低收入阶层免费提供或低价出售食品和其它日用品。５月３１日，现任总统阿方辛和当选总统梅内姆就当前国内形势紧急会晤并商定采取若干具体措施。
    观察家们认为，上述做法在一定程度上起到了稳定人心和缓和紧张局势的作用。
