The four teams that will compete in the semifinals of the 1989 European Men's Basketball Championship have been decided. According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on June 23, the Soviet Union, Italy, Yugoslavia, and Greece have secured their spots in the semifinals.

On June 22, the fourth round of group stage matches concluded in Zagreb, Yugoslavia. In the first group, the Olympic champions and runners-up from the previous year, the Soviet Union, defeated Spain 108-96, despite trailing for the first 29 minutes, including a 47-55 deficit at halftime. The fifth-place team from the previous year, Italy, easily defeated the Netherlands 89-66. In the second group, the third-place team from the previous year, Yugoslavia, defeated France 106-89, and the defending champions, Greece, defeated Bulgaria 103-73.

Yugoslavia's coach, Dusan Ivkovic, initially did not field his star player, Petar Petrovic, intending to save him for the semifinals. However, France played exceptionally well, leading 48-41 at halftime, forcing Ivkovic to bring Petrovic in during the second half. Petrovic's entry quickly turned the game around, and Yugoslavia won by 17 points. Petrovic alone scored 23 points in the second half.

According to the schedule, the semifinals will be held on June 24, with the Soviet Union facing Greece and Yugoslavia facing Italy.

　　欧洲男篮锦标赛决出四强
    新华社北京６月２３日电  据外电报道，１９８９年欧洲男子篮球锦标赛分组赛２２日在南斯拉夫萨格勒布结束，苏联、意大利、南斯拉夫和希腊队获半决赛权。
    ２２日进行了两个组第三轮的４场比赛。第一组中的奥运会冠军、上届亚军苏联队虽然以１０８∶９６力克西班牙队，但在前２９分钟比赛中一直落后，其中上半时曾以４７∶５５落后８分；上届第五名意大利队则以８９∶６６轻取荷兰队。第二组的两场比赛基本上都呈一边倒，上届第三名南斯拉夫队以１０６∶８９胜法国队，上届冠军希腊队以１０３∶７３胜保加利亚队。
    南斯拉夫队教练杜桑·伊夫科维奇一开始没有派主力佩特罗维奇上阵，想让他打半决赛。然而，法国队打得十分出色，上半时以４８∶４１领先，迫使伊夫科维奇在下半时派佩特罗维奇上场。佩特罗维奇上场后，很快使南斯拉夫队改变被动的局面，最后以１７分的优势获胜。其中，佩特罗维奇下半时一人投进２３分。
    根据赛程，半决赛将在２４日进行，由苏联队迎战希腊队，南斯拉夫队与意大利队交锋。
