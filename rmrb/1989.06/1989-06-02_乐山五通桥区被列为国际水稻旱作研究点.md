Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, June 2nd.

The experience of Leshan Wutongqiao District in Sichuan Province with dryland rice cultivation and the three-crop rotation system of wheat, corn, and sweet potatoes has garnered attention from international rice experts. Starting this year, it has been listed as an "International Rice Dryland Research Site" by the Asian Rice Farming Systems Network.

Since the early 1980s, Wutongqiao District has been experimenting with new farming methods. The district primarily cultivates wheat, corn, and sweet potatoes, interspersed with vegetables, potatoes, rapeseed, and legumes in a strip farming pattern. The annual grain yield per mu (approximately 0.0667 hectares) can reach 800 to 850 kilograms, which is 10 to 15 percent higher than conventional yields. Additionally, the district produces 800 to 1,000 kilograms of vegetables, 50 kilograms of rapeseed, and legumes per mu.
