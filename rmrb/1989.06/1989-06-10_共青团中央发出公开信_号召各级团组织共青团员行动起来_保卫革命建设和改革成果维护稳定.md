The Communist Youth League Central Committee Issues an Open Letter
Calls on All Levels of Youth League Organizations and League Members to Take Action
To Defend the Fruits of Revolution, Construction, and Reform and Maintain Stability

All levels of Youth League organizations and League members:

The counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing has been initially suppressed through the resolute struggle of the PLA martial law troops, the People's Armed Police, and the public security police. However, the situation in Beijing and some cities remains severe. Stabilizing the situation and ensuring urban security have become the primary tasks concerning the future of the country and the fundamental interests of the people. Therefore, the Communist Youth League Central Committee calls on all levels of Youth League organizations and all League members to take action under the leadership of the Party and the government, to defend the fruits of revolution, construction, and reform, to safeguard urban security, to maintain social stability, and to ensure people's livelihood, making positive contributions.

1. All League members should seriously study the "Notice to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Nation" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, resolutely implement the various instructions and orders of the Central Committee to stabilize the situation, recognize the nature of this struggle and the current severe situation, undergo tempering and testing, maintain consistency with the Central Committee of the Party, and unite with the Party and the people to strive for a stable and good social environment.

2. We must take a clear stand against illegal acts such as beating, smashing, looting, and arson that endanger the lives and property of the state and the people. We must abide by laws and regulations, not spread rumors, and not do anything harmful to the interests of the state and the people.

3. We must uphold the spirit of being masters of the state, firmly hold our positions in production, work, and study, be loyal to our duties, strive to complete our tasks, ensure production, and guarantee life. In restoring and maintaining normal economic order, social life order, and teaching order, we must play the role of model and leader as League members.

4. All levels of Youth League organizations and League cadres should adopt various effective methods to cooperate with the Party, government, and relevant departments to actively guide public opinion, do ideological work, stabilize emotions, and maintain the overall situation. We must actively communicate channels, promote understanding and trust between the Party and the government and young students, strengthen military-civilian relations, unite and organize the broad masses of League members and youth, and firmly adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles to contribute to the advancement of reform and opening up and the defense of socialist modernization construction.
