The People's Heroes Monument, which was defaced during the turmoil and riots, has been meticulously cleaned by the soldiers of the martial law troops and workers from relevant units in Beijing. Today, it has regained its solemn original appearance.

This afternoon, the reporter saw at the People's Heroes Monument that the revolutionary slogans, poems, and cartoons written with black ink, oil paint, and other materials on the marble base, Han white marble reliefs, and Han white marble railings and pillars around the monument in recent days, as well as the areas blackened by arson, have been cleaned by workers from the Beijing Sculpture Factory and the Beijing Environmental Sanitation Bureau. The two flagpoles that were knocked over on the front of the monument, as well as the damaged streetlight circuits around it, have been repaired by workers from the Beijing Fifth Construction Engineering Company and the Beijing Power Supply Bureau Streetlight Team. The nearly forty steps of the monument that were cracked by fire have also been repaired, but new granite steps need to be replaced. During the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots, the 2,700 square meters of lawn and 175 meters of cypress green hedges around the monument were completely destroyed and burned. Starting from yesterday morning, soldiers from a certain unit of the martial law troops and workers from the Beijing Municipal Gardening Bureau began to turn over the soil and dig holes in the original lawn area, replanting the lawn and cypress green hedges. This morning, the commander of a certain army of the martial law troops, Fu Bingyao, the director of the political department of the army, Li Dongheng, the brigade commander Zhang Zuoli, the political commissar Li Wen, and the deputy mayor of Beijing, Zhang Baifu, also came here to lay the lawn and plant the green hedges. Fu Bingyao, pointing to the monument and the surrounding lawn and green hedges, said excitedly, "This is a place that touches the hearts of people across the country and around the world. We, the martial law troops, will work together with the people of the capital to carefully restore its original appearance." Afterwards, Fu Bingyao, Zhang Baifu, and others took a group photo in front of the relief.

　　人民英雄纪念碑恢复原貌
    新华社北京六月十六日电  （记者潘善棠）在动乱和暴乱中被污损的人民英雄纪念碑，经过戒严部队官兵和北京市有关单位职工的精心洗刷，今天已恢复庄严的原貌。
    今天下午，记者在人民英雄纪念碑看到，前些日子在纪念碑四周的大理石碑基、汉白玉浮雕、汉白玉栏杆及柱子等处用黑墨水、油墨、颜料等书写的许多反革命标语、诗词、漫画，以及纵火烧物时被熏黑的地方，已被北京市雕塑厂、北京市环卫局的职工洗刷干净。纪念碑正面被弄倒的两根旗杆，以及四周被毁坏的路灯线路，也由北京市第五建筑工程公司、北京供电局路灯队的职工修复；被火烧后炸裂的近四十条纪念碑台阶条石，也已修补好，但还需用新的花岗岩条石来更换。在动乱和反革命暴乱期间，纪念碑四周的二千七百平方米的草坪和一百七十五米长的桧柏绿篱，被全部毁坏和烧毁。从昨天上午开始，戒严部队某部官兵和北京市园林局的职工，在原草坪上翻地、挖坑，重新铺了草坪、种桧柏绿篱。今天上午，戒严部队某军军长傅秉耀、军政治部主任李栋恒、师长张作礼、政委李文和北京市副市长张百发等领导，也来到这里铺草坪、种绿篱。傅秉耀指着纪念碑及四周的草坪、绿篱激动地说，这里是牵动着全国人民、全世界人民的心的地方。我们戒严部队要和首都群众一起，精心地将它的原貌恢复过来。之后，傅秉耀、张百发等在浮雕前合影留念。
