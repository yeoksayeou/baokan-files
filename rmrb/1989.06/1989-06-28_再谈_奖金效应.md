Further Discussion on the "Bonus Effect"

Chen Qiangsheng

After reading “Discussion on the ‘Bonus Effect’” (April 13, 1989, People’s Daily, 5th edition), I found it quite insightful, but felt that the discussion was incomplete and needed further elaboration.

A bonus, by definition, is money awarded as a reward. It, along with certificates, medals, and banners, is designed to motivate people. The difference is that a bonus uses money as the reward medium, combining ideological and political work with material interests. It contains both spiritual motivation and material incentives. If used properly, a bonus can be effective.

The reason why the “bonus effect” is not ideal today is mainly because many people have a one-sided understanding of bonuses. Many people only focus on the “money” aspect of the bonus and ignore the “reward.” Some even think that honor cannot be eaten, and only money is practical. These people, when receiving a bonus, casually discard the “reward” as packaging for the “money.” If one only focuses on the “money,” what significance does a bonus of ten or eight yuan a month have? How can such a bonus motivate these people?

Moreover, some people who distribute bonuses also only focus on the “money” aspect and forget about the “reward.” They say that workers today do not care about ten or eight yuan a month, so there is no need to spend too much effort on it. As a result, distributing bonuses becomes just another way of distributing money, sitting in a row and dividing the fruits, giving a share to everyone, even to those who have not worked for years. What honor is there in such a “bonus”? How can it stimulate enthusiasm?

Some people feel that the bonus effect is not ideal because their expectations for bonuses are too high, and they do not get what they want. It should be known that even if bonuses are used well, their effect is limited. Distributing bonuses, like other rewards, is a method to motivate enthusiasm, but it is not the only method, nor is it the fundamental method. The fundamental method is to strengthen ideological and political work and raise the ideological awareness of workers, which is a long-term factor. Some people advocate that the amount of bonuses should gradually increase from low to high each year, gradually increasing the stimulus, so as to maintain or even enhance the bonus effect. Under this guiding ideology, units compete with each other, giving more and more bonuses, with some bonuses already exceeding wages by many times. The bonus effect? It becomes smaller and smaller, to the point of stimulating the “won’t work without a bonus” mentality, which is contrary to expectations and counterproductive. Such lessons should be learned. This is not to say that bonuses are not needed, but that one cannot rely solely on, or mainly on, this one method.

### 再谈“奖金效应”

　　再谈“奖金效应”
    陈前生
    读《“奖金效应”谈》（１９８９年４月１３日《人民日报》第５版），颇有同感，但觉意犹未竟，需再续上几笔。
    奖金，顾名思义，是用于奖励的金钱。它和奖状、奖章、奖旗等都是为了调动人的积极性而设的。所不同的是，奖金用金钱作为奖励的载体，它是思想政治工作和物质利益原则的结合，既蕴含着精神动力，又蕴含着物质动力。奖金作为激励手段，如果运用得好，是会有效果的。
    当今“奖金效应”之所以不理想，主要是相当多的人对奖金的认识失之片面。不少人只看重了奖金的“金”而忽视了“奖”。有些人甚至认为，荣誉不能当饭吃，只有“金”最实惠。这些人在拿奖金的时候，毫不悭吝地把“奖”作为“金”的包装扔掉了。既然只注意到“金”，一个月十块八块钱何足道哉？奖金对这些人能有什么激励效应？
    还有，如今一些发奖金的人也只注意到奖金的“金”，忘掉了“奖”。他们说，现在一个月十块八块钱职工不在乎，用不着在这上面多花工夫。结果把发奖金纯粹当成分钱，排排坐，分果果，见人一份，甚至长年不上班者，一个子儿也不少。这种“奖金”还有什么荣誉可言？哪能刺激出积极性来？
    有些人之所以觉得奖金效应不理想，还因为对奖金的期望值过高，结果未能如愿。须知，奖金就是运用得好，它的作用也是有限的。发奖金如同其他奖励一样，是调动积极性的一种方法，但不是唯一方法，也不是根本方法。根本方法还是要加强思想政治工作、提高职工的思想觉悟，这是长远起作用的因素。有人主张，奖金数额应由低到高逐年增加，逐步加大刺激，这样可以保持甚至提高奖金效应。在这种思想指导下，单位之间互相攀比，越发越多，有的奖金已超过工资许多。奖金效应呢？却越来越小，以至刺激出“不给奖金不干活的毛病”来，这就事与愿违，适得其反了。这样的教训是应该记取的。这不是说奖金不需要，而是说不能单靠，或主要靠这一条。
