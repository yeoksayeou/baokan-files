Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, June 19th.

According to statistics, the average annual fruit consumption per person in Guangdong Province reaches 47.5 kilograms, ranking at the top of the nation.

Guangdong is renowned as the "Land of Fruits," with a continuous supply of seasonal fruits. However, in the late 1970s, the province's fruit cultivation area was only around 2 million mu (approximately 133,333 hectares), with an annual total production of about 3 million tons. Last year, the province's total fruit production reached 2.814 million tons.

Currently, both urban and rural fruit markets have abundant supplies, diverse varieties, and stable prices. On the streets of Guangzhou, piles of pineapples and watermelons can be seen, along with bananas, lychees, mangoes, wax apples, grapes, and plums, which are all in season.

　　广东人均年占有水果４７公斤
    新华社广州６月１９日电  据统计：广东省年平均每人水果占有量达４７．５公斤，跃居全国前列。
    广东素称水果之乡，四时佳果不断。可是７０年代后期，全省水果种植面积仅存２００万亩左右，年总产量只有约３０万吨。去年，全省水果总产量达到２８１．４万吨。
    眼下城乡水果市场货源充足，品种繁多，价格平稳。广州街头的菠萝、西瓜成堆，香蕉、荔枝、芒果、杨梅、葡萄、李子等也相继上市。
