Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 21st.

Recently, artists from Suzhou specially created a batch of calligraphy and painting works, which were entrusted to the General Political Department's Propaganda Department to be sent to the martial law troops in Beijing.

Famous calligrapher Sha Manweng said, "I have lived for over 70 years and have never seen anyone use chaos and rebellion to demand so-called democracy, freedom, and human rights. The Cultural Revolution was enough to cause us misery. To deal with these thugs, we must implement dictatorship; otherwise, the country will have no peace." He wrote a scroll with the words "Guard your post, protect the people" and dedicated it to the martial law troops in Beijing.

Artist Du Zhonghua from the Suzhou Chinese Painting Institute was deeply moved by the revolutionary violence he saw on the radio and television, and by the soldiers' endurance in protecting the people. Despite being ill, he created a large-scale Chinese painting titled "Standing Tall and Proud," praising the People's Liberation Army's iron will in the face of violence.

National model for supporting the military, Wu Men School painter Shen Bin, upon learning of the martial law troops' suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, spent the night with his family planning and creating a scroll titled "Galloping Horses." The painting depicts three spirited horses, symbolizing the heroic spirit of the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the public security officers who stood shoulder to shoulder in Beijing to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

Along with this batch of calligraphy and paintings, a letter of thanks was also sent to the martial law troops, expressing gratitude for their role in suppressing the rebellion and establishing their merits for the country and the people.

    苏州书画家翰墨寄情慰问戒严部队
    新华社北京电（通讯员王德意、记者黄智敏）连日来，人民解放军在京文艺单位分赴各戒严部队进行慰问演出。据解放军总政文化部介绍，截至６月１８日，在京的部队文艺单位已为戒严部队演出１２０多场次。
    参加慰问演出的有总政歌剧团、总政话剧团、总政歌舞团、解放军艺术学院、军乐团、北京军区歌舞团、海政歌舞团、空政歌舞团、二炮文工团和八一电影制片厂等单位。著名演员马玉涛、田华、马国光、张越男、杨洪基、张积民等积极参加演出。慰问演出受到戒严部队官兵热烈欢迎，认为这是党中央、国务院和中央军委对他们的关怀，表示一定要出色地完成好戒严任务。
    新华社南京电　（通讯员王林林）苏州书画家近日特地创作一批书画作品，委托总政宣传部转赠北京戒严部队。
    著名书法家沙曼翁说，我活了７０多岁，从来没有看到过用制造动乱、暴乱的方法要求所谓民主、自由、人权。“文革”把我们折腾得够惨了。对付这帮暴徒就是要实行专政，否则国无宁日。他挥毫书写了“坚守岗位，卫国爱民”的条幅献给北京戒严部队。
    苏州国画院画家杜重划，从广播、电视里看到极少数歹徒的反革命暴行，看到子弟兵为了保护群众忍辱负重的行动，深受感动。他抱病创作了“崎崛昂扬”的大型国画，歌颂人民解放军面对暴行大雪压顶不弯腰的钢铁气质。
    全国拥军模范、吴门画派画家沈彬如获悉戒严部队平息北京反革命暴乱时，与全家人一起连夜构思，创作了“奔马图”画卷。画面上三匹斗志高昂的骏马，象征在北京并肩平息反革命暴乱的人民解放军部队、武警部队和公安干警的英雄气概。
    与这批书画同时送到北京的还有给戒严部队的慰问信，感谢他们在制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱中，为祖国、为人民建立的功勋。
