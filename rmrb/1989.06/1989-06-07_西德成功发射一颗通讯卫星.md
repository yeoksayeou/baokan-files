Our reporter Jiang Jian Guo reports from Bonn: West Germany's first communications satellite, "Copernicus," was successfully launched yesterday at 00:37 Central European Time from the Kourou space base in French Guiana. It has now entered its predetermined orbit at 23.5 degrees east longitude and 36,000 kilometers above the equator. It will officially begin operations in mid-August.

"Copernicus" weighs 1.4 tons and will be used for telephone communications, television, and radio broadcasts. In November 1987, West Germany launched a broadcasting satellite, "TVSat1," which failed because its solar panels did not deploy.

This "Copernicus" satellite was launched into space by the improved version of the "Ariane 4" rocket, the "Ariane 44L." A Japanese satellite was also launched simultaneously. The "Ariane 44L" rocket was used for the first time.

　　西德成功发射一颗通讯卫星
    本报波恩６月７日电  记者江建国报道：西德自己的第一颗通讯卫星“哥白尼”昨天在中欧时间零时３７分从法属圭亚那的库鲁宇航基地发射成功，现已按预定计划进入东经２３．５度、距地球３６０００公里的赤道上空的轨道定点，８月中旬将正式启用。
    “哥白尼”重１．４吨，将用于电话通讯、电视及广播节目的转播。１９８７年１１月西德曾发射了一枚广播卫星“ＴＶＳａｔｌ”，因太阳能电池板未展开而归于失败。
    这颗“哥白尼”卫星是由“阿丽亚娜４型”火箭的改进型“阿丽亚娜４４Ｌ”送上太空的。同时发射的还有一颗日本的卫星。“阿丽亚娜４４Ｌ型”火箭是第一次使用。
