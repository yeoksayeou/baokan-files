Recently, a 16-year-old boy named Wang Naikui from Wangtuo Village in Fengshan Township, Sihong County, Jiangsu Province, was killed by a gunshot. Wang Naikui's son could make his own bird gun. His nephew, a few years younger, saw his uncle had a gun and asked his uncle to make one for him. Soon, the nephew's bird gun stopped working, so he went to his uncle to have it fixed. The uncle let his nephew play with his own gun while he fixed the other one. Unfortunately, the nephew accidentally fired the gun, and the bullet hit the uncle who was fixing the gun, killing him instantly.
