	People's Daily, Caracas, June 2 (Reporter Zhu Manting)

	Following the attack on the head of the secret police, General Masá Marquez, by a drug trafficking gang, Colombian authorities have arrested 28 police officers and agents, accusing them of working for drug trafficking organizations.

	Among the arrested police officers are the former police chief of Sucre Province and several of his subordinates. One of them, Colonel Virgilio Gayo, who was in charge of the secret investigation department of the provincial police, was found with a box full of cash when arrested. This money is likely to belong to a drug trafficking organization.

	Colombian Police Chief Gomez Padilla stated in a communique that drug trafficking organizations are creating instability in state institutions through criminal acts such as the assassination attempt on General Masá Marquez. The police are determined to fight against drug trafficking, subversion, and various violent activities.

	Additionally, the two major drug trafficking organizations in Colombia, the Medellín Cartel and the Cali Cartel, are constantly killing each other in a struggle for control of the drug market. Almost every day, there are assassinations and bombings.

　　哥警官贩毒被逮捕
    本报加拉加斯６月２日电  记者朱满庭报道：在秘密警察首脑马萨·马尔克斯将军遭到贩毒集团的袭击之后，哥伦比亚当局逮捕了２８名警方的官员和特工人员，指控他们为贩毒集团效劳。
    被捕的警方官员中有苏格雷省前警察局局长和他的几名下属，其中一个叫比吉里奥·加约的上校，是该省警方秘密调查部门的负责人，他在被捕时，有一个装满了钞票的箱子被查获。这些钱很可能是属于一个贩毒集团的。
    哥伦比亚警察总局局长戈麦斯·帕迪里亚在一份公报中指出，贩毒集团正以刺杀马萨·马尔克斯将军这类犯罪行径制造国家机构的不稳定，警方决心与贩毒、颠覆和各种暴力活动作斗争。
    此外，哥伦比亚两大贩毒集团麦德林卡特尔和加里卡特尔为争夺毒品市场地盘也正不断相互残杀，几乎每天都有暗杀爆炸事件发生。
