Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 14th.

The Martial Law Command Headquarters Press Office announced: At 23:30 tonight, this office received a phone call from six Peking University students who had participated in the hunger strike, relayed through relevant departments of the Military Commission. The content of the call is as follows:

We, a group of students from Peking University, firmly support the Chinese government's just action of expelling two journalists from the Associated Press and Voice of America. The government should have done this long ago. These troublemakers have caused us students great harm. In the past period, they were always with the student leaders in Tiananmen Square, acting as if they were bosom friends, spreading rumors, and confusing the public. They took advantage of our naivety, simplicity, and kindness to incite our fervor, destroy our rationality, and lead us down the path of opposing the government. They exploited our desire to accelerate the process of democratization, inciting extreme anarchism. They used our patriotic passion to instigate us to block roads, lie on tracks, and engage in beating, smashing, looting, burning, charging, and killing. They exploited our desire for attention and vanity, recording us and broadcasting live, making us perform like clowns for their reactionary propaganda, cursing our motherland and praising America. They spread their plague across Tiananmen Square, across China, and around the world. Now it is time to expel them from the country, carry out thorough disinfection, and clean up. Of course, they will not stop spreading rumors, but the viruses they release have enhanced our immunity.

　　北大六名参加绝食学生支持政府驱逐美国记者
    新华社北京６月１４日电  戒严部队指挥部新闻处消息：今晚２３时３０分，本处接到北京大学参加过绝食的６名大学生通过军委有关部门转来的一个电话，内容如下：
    我们北大的部分学生，坚决支持我国政府驱逐美联社和“美国之音”两名记者的正义行动，政府早该这样做了。这些瘟神把我们学生坑苦了。前一段他们和我们在广场的学生头头形影相吊，亲如手足，编造谣言，混淆视听；他们利用我们的幼稚、单纯和善良，煽起我们的狂热，毁掉我们的理智，把我们引向与政府为敌的歧途；他们利用我们希望加速民主化进程的良好愿望，煽起我们极端的无政府主义；他们利用我们爱国的一腔热血，鼓动我们拦车、卧轨，打、砸、抢、烧、冲、杀；他们利用我们出风头、爱虚荣的心理，给我们录相，现场直播，使我们像跳梁小丑一样为他们的反动宣传进行丑恶表演，大骂祖国，大吹美国；他们把瘟疫撒遍天安门广场，撒遍中华大地和全世界。现在是该把他们驱逐出境、进行彻底消毒和打扫了。当然，他们不会停止造谣，但他们施放的病毒使我们增强了免疫力。
