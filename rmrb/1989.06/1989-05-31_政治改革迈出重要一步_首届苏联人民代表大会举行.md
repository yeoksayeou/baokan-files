A Significant Step in Political Reform—The First Session of the Soviet Union's Congress of People's Deputies

The first session of the Soviet Union's Congress of People's Deputies, held on May 25, marked the birth of the Soviet Union's new highest state power organ. The congress elected General Secretary Gorbachev as the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR and selected a standing committee of 422 people's deputies to form the Supreme Soviet of the USSR. During the congress, delegates engaged in heated debates on procedural matters, the selection of the chairman, and a series of sharp political, economic, and ethnic issues. Almost all votes saw dissenting opinions, breaking away from the dull and rigid atmosphere of past Soviet congresses. The Soviet media hailed it as a "significant milestone in the reform process."

The traditional highest state power organ in the Soviet Union was the Supreme Soviet. It consisted of the Union Council and the Nationalities Council, totaling 1,500 deputies. The Supreme Soviet then elected a presidium composed of one chairman, fifteen vice-chairmen, and twenty commissioners. The chairman of the presidium performed the duties of the head of state, primarily in a ceremonial capacity. The fundamental flaw of the old power structure lay in the formalistic method of electing representatives. Candidates for deputies at all levels were designated by the leadership, followed by a unanimous election that was merely a formality. Voters simply cast a vote of approval, and the leadership announced the result as "unanimously passed." Subsequent layers of recommendations and elections were also mere formalities, culminating in the formation of the Supreme Soviet and the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet. The deputies thus elected could not truly represent the interests of the voters, rendering the Supreme Soviet a mere rubber stamp for government agencies.

The concept of the new highest state power organ was proposed by Soviet leader Gorbachev at the 19th National Congress of the CPSU last June and was legally confirmed in the constitutional amendment draft and electoral law draft passed at the end of last year.

The new state power organ is a four-tier political structure consisting of the Congress of People's Deputies, the Supreme Soviet, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet, and the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet. The functions of the Congress of People's Deputies and the powers of the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet have been significantly enhanced.

The deputies for this session of the Soviet Congress were elected based on the principle of competitive elections. Candidates are no longer designated by their positions and seniority by various levels of leadership but are proposed by a certain number of voters and determined through competition in preliminary elections. By the time of the national vote to elect people's deputies, a total of 8,000 candidates had been selected, creating a situation where two, several, or even a dozen candidates competed for a single deputy position. Voters truly felt the weight of their ballots, igniting their political responsibility and patriotism. In the public vote held on March 26, dozens of first secretaries of regional committees were voted out due to mediocre performance or privileges, and two chairmen of the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the union republics and two chairmen of the Council of Ministers of the union republics also failed to secure a seat. In previous elections, different quotas were set for different types of representatives. This formalistic approach often allowed individuals with no political experience to enter the highest state power organ, while those knowledgeable in politics, economics, and law were excluded.

This election completely abolished such restrictions, ensuring that voters could freely choose based on the candidates' actions and their election platforms. From the election results, the proportion of workers, peasants, and women clearly decreased. Although some leaders above the regional committee level were voted out, the number of Communist Party members among the deputies increased significantly, with their proportion rising by 16.1%. This indicates that through reform, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has established a solid reputation among the people, who consciously distinguish between the party's negative tendencies and its mainstream, and place high hopes in the party.

A notable feature of this election is that a large number of government officials did not participate in the competition. Except for the Chairman of the Council of Ministers, five Politburo members and ministers in the government who held concurrent positions became ordinary voters. To ensure the independent legislative status of the Congress of People's Deputies and its supervisory role over the government, the electoral law draft stipulated for the first time that ministers could not simultaneously become people's deputies. Therefore, the First Deputy Chairman of the State Construction Commission, Yeltsin, chose to become a people's deputy and resigned from his ministerial position.

Some issues arose during this election, such as the principle of competitive elections not being fully implemented, with some departments still practicing single-candidate elections or formalistic competitive elections; some electoral districts also saw protests, hunger strikes, and strikes that disrupted social order and violated the law. This indicates that both the electoral law and the organization of elections need further improvement. Overall, the election was conducted in a lively and democratic atmosphere, marking a crucial step in the Soviet Union's political reform.

### 政治改革迈出重要一步——首届苏联人民代表大会举行

　　政治改革迈出重要一步
    ——首届苏联人民代表大会举行
    胡锡进
    五月二十五日召开的首届苏联人民代表大会，宣告了苏联新的最高国家权力机构的诞生。大会选举戈尔巴乔夫总书记为苏联最高苏维埃主席，并选举出由四百二十二名人民代表组成的大会常设机构——苏联最高苏维埃。大会期间，与会代表就大会程序、主席人选及一系列尖锐的政治、经济、民族问题进行了激烈的辩论，几乎所有的表决都出现了反对票，一反过去苏维埃代表大会沉闷、死板的气氛，被苏联舆论界称为“改革进程中的重要里程碑”。
    苏联传统的国家最高权力机构是苏联最高苏维埃。它由联盟院和民族院组成，共计一千五百名代表。最高苏维埃再选举出由主席一人，副主席十五人，委员二十人组成的最高苏维埃主席团，主席团主席行使国家元首的职能，主要起礼仪性作用。旧的权力机构的根本弊端在于流于形式的选举代表的方法。各级苏维埃代表的候选人都由领导机关指定，然后在等额选举中走过场。选民们只是投张赞成票，然后由领导机关宣布“一致通过”的结果。接下来的层层推荐、层层选举也都是走过场，直至产生最高苏维埃和最高苏维埃主席团。这样选出的苏维埃代表并不能真正代表选民的利益，最高苏维埃形同虚设，成为政府机关的“橡皮图章”。
    新的最高国家权力机构的设想是由苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫于去年六月在苏共第十九次全国代表会议上提出的，并在去年年底通过的宪法修改草案和选举法草案中得到法律上的确认。
    新的国家权力机构是一个由人民代表大会——最高苏维埃——最高苏维埃主席团——最高苏维埃主席组成的四级政治结构。人民代表大会的职能和最高苏维埃主席的权力大大提高。
    此次苏联人代会的代表是依据差额选举的原则选举产生的。谁当候选人不再凭职务、资历由各级领导机关指定，而是由一定数量的选民自由提出，通过竞争在预选中加以确定。截至全民投票选举人民代表前，共选出八千名候选人，形成两名、几名甚至十几名候选人角逐一名代表资格的局面。选民真正感到他们手中选票的份量，激发起他们的政治责任感和爱国热情。在三月二十六日举行的公民投票中，几十名州委第一书记由于政绩平平或因搞特权落选，两个加盟共和国的最高苏维埃主席团主席和两个加盟共和国的部长会议主席也榜上无名。以往的各次选举对不同代表的比例都有规定。这种形式主义的作法常常使一些根本没有参政能力的人进入国家最高权力机关，而那些熟谙政治、经济、法律的有识之士却被拒之门外。
    这次选举完全取消了这种限制，从而保证了选民根据候选人的行为和他们的竞选纲领自由做出选择。从大选的结果来看，工、农、妇女的比例明显下降；尽管一些州委以上的领导干部落选，但代表中共产党员的总数却大大增多，所占比例提高了百分之十六点一。这表明通过改革，苏联共产党在人民心中建立起稳固的威信，人们自觉地将党内不良倾向与党的主流分开，并对党寄予厚望。
    这次选举有一个引人注目的特征：一大批政府官员没有参加竞选。除部长会议主席以外，在政府中兼职的五名政治局委员和政府各部部长都做了普通选民。为确保人民代表大会独立的立法地位和对政府的监督作用，选举法草案首次规定，各部部长不能同时成为人民代表。因此，国家建委第一副主席叶利钦宁愿当人民代表而辞去部长职务。
    这次选举中也出现了一些问题，如差额选举的原则没有贯彻到底，在一些部门中仍有搞等额选举或走形式的差额选举的情况；部分选区还出现了抗议性绝食、罢工等破坏社会秩序、违反法律的过火行为。这表明从选举法到对选举的组织工作都需要进一步完善。但总的来说，选举是在热烈、民主的气氛中进行的，标志着苏联的政治改革迈出了关键的一步。
