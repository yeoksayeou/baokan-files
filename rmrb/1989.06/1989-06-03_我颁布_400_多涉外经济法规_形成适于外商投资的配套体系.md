Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 3rd.

China has already promulgated over 400 foreign economic laws and regulations, thereby forming a comprehensive legal system conducive to foreign investment.

Ji Chongwei, a standing member of the State Council Development Research Center and vice chairman of the China Foreign Investment Enterprise Association, recently stated that over the past 10 years, from 1978 to the present, China has issued foreign-related regulations such as the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Chinese-Foreign Joint Ventures," the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Chinese-Foreign Cooperative Joint Ventures," the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Wholly Foreign-Owned Enterprises," and the "Regulations on Encouraging Foreign Investment." These regulations, under the principle of equality and mutual benefit, have made specific provisions regarding foreign investment in areas such as capital injection, capital registration, investment industries, operational methods, profit sharing, remittance of funds, and tax payments. This ensures that the legal rights of foreign investors are protected.

At the same time, China has signed investment protection agreements with 24 countries and double taxation avoidance agreements with 22 countries. It has also joined the United Nations "Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards" and the "Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property," as well as the "World Intellectual Property Organization." Nationwide, over 200 law firms and accounting firms specializing in foreign-related legal and accounting services have been established, providing foreign investors with comprehensive legal protection in China.
