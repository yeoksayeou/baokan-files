	“Hero Bikes” Have Ghosts Beneath Them, “Lover Bikes” Have Many Accidents in Front of Them
	Over 100 Motorcycle Riders Die in Wuhan

	People's Daily reports: Reporter Luo Pan reports: By May of this year, over 100 motorcycle drivers in Wuhan have died in traffic accidents. Most of them died due to overspeeding, violating traffic rules, and colliding with cars, walls, or flipping over.

	Motorcycles are light and fast, but their braking stability is poor. Among the over 100 deceased, a significant number were themselves violating traffic rules and met with tragic ends. These individuals drove fast and recklessly to show off their masculinity, or sped and weaved through traffic with their girlfriends to display their romantic prowess, ultimately leading to tragedy. A television actor, while taking his girlfriend from Wuchang to Hankou to buy wedding items, sped up on the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge despite the need to slow down. He attempted to overtake another vehicle but was struck by the trailer of a parallel truck, causing his girlfriend to fall under the wheels. Both perished. A female statistician from a certain factory, Xiao Hong, was riding on a motorcycle driven by a male colleague from her factory. The motorcycle sped through a busy street, colliding with an oncoming car. The motorcycle was destroyed, and both riders died instantly.

	Driving without a license also resulted in over 10 serious traffic accidents. Zhang, who had no driver's license, borrowed someone else's motorcycle to buy cigarettes just a short walk away. He collided with a large truck as soon as he hit the street, dying instantly.

	It is reported that Wuhan City has taken measures to control the issuance of new motorcycle licenses for private individuals.

　　“英雄车”下有冤魂　“情人车”前事故多
    武汉百余摩托骑士丧生
    本报讯  记者罗盘报道：到今年５月，武汉已有１００多名摩托车驾驶者死于交通事故，他们大部分是超速驾驶、违章行驶而撞车、撞墙或翻车身亡的。
    摩托车虽然轻快，但刹车稳定性差。在１００多名死难者中，相当一部分人是自己违章，自食其果。这些人开快车、飞车以显示男人气概，或者带女朋友兜风猛冲猛超以表现情人风度，因而导致悲剧。一名电视剧演员，带女朋友从武昌到汉口购买结婚物品。摩托车上武汉长江大桥后本该减速，但他强行超车，被平行的货车拖厢挂倒，女朋友跌入车轮下，双双丧命。某厂统计员、女青年小洪，在搭乘本厂一位男青工的摩托车时，摩托车在闹市区高速猛赶，与迎面而来的汽车相撞，摩托车被撞散，两人当场死亡。
    无证驾驶，也造成了１０余起恶性交通事故。曾某本无驾驶证，但他为了显示本领，上街买烟只需步行十来分钟，也要借别人的摩托车去，结果，一上街就撞上一辆大货车，当场丧命。
    据悉，武汉市已采取措施，控制私人新购摩托车的牌照发放。
