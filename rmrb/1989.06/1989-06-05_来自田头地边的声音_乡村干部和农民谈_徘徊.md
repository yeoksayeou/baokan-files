People's Daily launched a discussion on how to break through agricultural stagnation, which has received widespread attention and enthusiastic support from rural cadres and farmers. Many cadres and villagers who have long been engaged in farming have actively submitted articles, combining local realities to express many good opinions and suggestions. However, due to limited space, it is not possible to publish all of them. The following is a summary:

Strengthening the Protection and Management of Land
Strengthening the protection and management of land is a consistent view in the submissions. Farmers from Hebei Province's Leting County's Shapu Village, Fang Huwen, and those from Zhejiang and Hubei provinces believe that it is necessary to quickly stop the trend of recklessly occupying arable land for housing and kilns in rural areas. In recent years, the situation of destroying land for housing and brick kilns in various places is astonishing and continues to develop, making limited arable land continuously eroded and damaged, directly affecting agricultural production. Now, on the one hand, leadership must be strengthened, and farmers' awareness of cherishing land for future generations must be enhanced; on the other hand, the land law cannot be allowed to remain a mere formality. For serious cases of recklessly occupying arable land, criminal responsibility must be pursued in accordance with the law, and there can be no leniency. At the same time, conditions must be created to reclaim already damaged arable land.

Frequent adjustments to contracted land should be avoided, according to farmers Li Dong and others from Lin County, Shanxi Province. They believe that frequent land adjustments have more disadvantages than advantages. This practice weakens farmers' emotional attachment to the land and affects their investment in it. One farmer said, "This year I farm this plot of land, but who knows who will farm it in a few years?" As a result, some places have seen a trend of exploitative farming, leading to a decline in soil fertility and increasing soil erosion. The ultimate result is a decrease in grain and cotton yields.

Chen Huixin, the Party Committee Secretary of Pingyuan Township, Changle County, Shandong Province, proposed the idea of developing forestry to protect land. After the development of forestry, not only can wind and sand be prevented and fixed, but rainfall can also be increased, the ecological environment can be improved, and soil erosion can be prevented.

Exploiting Internal Potential
Agricultural stagnation has both external and internal causes, and these causes contain various potentials.

Water conservancy work should not be neglected, as advocated by farmers Lu Danzhang and others from Fengxian County, Hebei Province. In some villages, water conservancy facilities are aging and their efficiency is decreasing, often resulting in difficulties in irrigation during droughts and drainage during floods. In some places, it takes a village group 10 days, or even half a month, to irrigate a single plot of land, missing the agricultural season and causing farmers to worry.

Stopping the trend of competitive consumption and increasing agricultural investment is the suggestion of Hong Qiaojun, a farmer from Yujian County, Jiangxi Province, and Han Feng, a farmer from Tong County, Beijing. They reflected in their letters that in recent years, during weddings, funerals, birthdays, and festivals, the trend of competitive consumption in rural areas has been rampant. Some people spend money recklessly, leading to high debts and no money for production. Therefore, according to the situation in each place, new forms of celebration that are easy for both young and old people to accept should be created to achieve both liveliness and frugality, stopping the trend of competitive consumption and using the money to increase agricultural investment.

Bo Dongguang, a farmer from Wenjiang Village, Fenyi County, Jiangxi Province, believes that to quickly get agricultural production out of the trough, one key is to seriously rectify the cadre teams at the township and village levels and improve their quality. Currently, some village cadres are unable to lead farmers in scientific farming but are energetic in leading farmers in gambling and clan activities. Only by quickly adopting measures such as training, replacement, and streamlining, can a lean, high-quality cadre team that shares weal and woe with farmers be established, and agriculture have the hope of further development.

Agricultural technology extension and service system should be established in rural areas, according to Li Feng, deputy township head of Dayan Township, Linyi County, Shanxi Province. First, the work of returning agricultural technicians to their posts should be done well, and they should not be pulled into irrelevant matters; second, more agricultural technology extension training classes should be held to train backbone personnel and promote overall development.

The Entire Society Should Contribute to Boosting Agriculture
Supply and marketing cooperatives should not only be about money but also consider the interests of farmers, as expressed by Cheng Rongxiang, a farmer from Huzhou City, Zhejiang Province. The supply and marketing cooperatives were originally set up by farmers themselves, but some cooperatives are only concerned with how to make money, neglecting the interests of farmers.

Left Yuhua, a farmer from Xingqiao Town, Sheyang County, Jiangsu Province, believes that fake pesticides and fertilizers should not be allowed into the market. Using fake pesticides, the pests still jump; using fake fertilizers, the seedlings still turn yellow and thin. This not only harms the farmers but also harms agriculture. In the future, factories and companies involved in such fraudulent activities should not only be punished by law but also be held responsible for compensating farmers for all economic losses.

Acting according to the law of value and achieving equivalent exchange is the common view of Zhang Rumin, the Party branch secretary of Zhangjiazhuang Village, Changli County, Hebei Province, and more than ten farmers from other provinces and cities. They believe that the "urban bias" policy is becoming more severe, and the state's investment and support for agriculture are decreasing year by year, making the price ratio of agricultural and industrial products unreasonable, seriously dampening farmers' enthusiasm for farming. In addition, due to the law of value, the economic benefits of growing grain and cotton are low, making it difficult to get rich, which is a kind of sacrifice. Therefore, farmers are turning to high-income economic crops, resulting in a decrease in the area of grain and cotton cultivation. Relying on farmers to make sacrifices to develop grain and cotton production is not a long-term solution. As farmers' commodity economy awareness increases, this method is becoming less effective. If the problem is to be solved fundamentally, it is still necessary to act according to the law of value and gradually rationalize the price relationship, thereby mobilizing farmers' enthusiasm for growing grain and cotton.

专栏：怎样突破徘徊

　　来自田头地边的声音
    ——乡村干部和农民谈“徘徊”
    陈秋中
    本报开展如何突破农业徘徊的讨论后，受到了乡村干部和农民的广泛关注和热情支持。一些常年与土地打交道的干部和群众踊跃来稿，结合当地的实际情况，发表了许多好的看法和意见，但由于版面有限，不可能一一刊登，现综述如下：
　　加强对土地的保护和管理
    加强对土地的保护和各项管理是来稿中比较一致的观点。河北省乐亭县沙铺村方惠文和浙江、湖北等地的农民认为，要尽快制止农村中出现的滥占耕地建房、建窑的歪风。这几年，各地农村毁地建房、建砖瓦窑的情况惊人，而且还在继续发展，使有限的耕地不断遭到蚕食、破坏，农业生产直接受到影响。现在，一方面要领导重视，提高农民为子孙后代着想、惜土如金的自觉性；另一方面，不能让土地法长期成为摆设，对于严重的滥占耕地事件，要依法追究刑事责任，决不能手软。同时，对已经毁坏的耕地，要创造条件复耕。
    不能频繁地调整承包土地，这是山西省临县安业乡李东等农民的看法。他们认为，频繁调整土地弊多利少。这种做法淡化了农民对土地的感情；影响了他们对土地的投入。一位农民说，今年我种这块地，谁知过几年谁种？于是，一些地方出现只种地、不养地的掠夺性经营倾向，导致地力下降，水土流失日益严重。最终结果自然是粮棉产量下降。
    山东省昌乐县平原乡党委书记陈会欣提出了以发展林业保护土地的思路。林业发展后，不仅可以防风固沙，而且可以增加降雨量，改善生态环境，防止水土流失。
　　尽力从内部挖掘潜力
    农业出现徘徊，不仅有外部的原因，也有内部的原因。这些原因中蕴藏着多种潜力。
    不能再忽视水利工作了，这是河北省丰润县农民卢单昌等人的呼声。在一些乡村中，水利设施老化日趋严重，效益越来越低，常常是旱难灌，涝难排。有的地方浇地，一个村民小组浇一遍需要１０天，甚至半个月，贻误农时农民干着急。
    刹住消费攀比风，增加农业投入，这是江西余江县农民洪巧俊和北京通县农民韩枫的建议。他们在来信中反映，这几年，在婚丧、生日、节日等活动中，农村消费攀比风盛行，一些人毫不顾忌地大把花钱，以致债台高筑，无钱投入生产。因此，要根据各地的情况，创造一些青年人和老年人都容易接受的新的喜庆形式，做到既热闹又节俭，刹住攀比消费风，把钱用于增加农业投入。
    江西省分宜县文江村农民董思光认为，要使农业生产尽快走出低谷，关键之一就是认真整顿乡村两级干部队伍，提高他们的素质。现在，部分村干部，无力领导农民科学种田，却有劲“领导”农民抹牌赌博、开展宗族活动。只有尽快采取培训、撤换、精简等办法，建立一支精干的、与农民休戚与共的、高素质的干部队伍，农业才有希望得到进一步发展。
    要建立乡村农业技术推广服务体系，这是山西临猗县大阎乡副乡长李峰的看法。首先要做好乡农技员的归队工作，不能拉他们干一些与专业无关的杂事；其次，要多办农业技术推广培训班，培训骨干，带动全面。
　　全社会都来为农业升温“添柴”
    供销社不能只姓“钱”，更要替农民着想，这是浙江省湖州市农民程荣祥的心里话。供销社本来是农民自己办的，但有些供销社却专门琢磨如何赚钱，把农民的利益丢到了一边。
    江苏省射阳县兴桥镇农民左玉华认为，一定不能让假农药、假化肥流进市场。用了假农药，虫儿照样跳；用了假化肥，禾苗照样黄又瘦。这不仅把农民坑苦了，而且把农业也坑苦了。今后，对于干这类坑人勾当的工厂、公司，不仅要依法制裁，而且要责其向农民赔偿全部经济损失。
    按价值规律办事，实现等价交换，这是河北省昌黎县张家庄村党支部书记张汝明和另外一些省市十几名农民的共同观点。他们认为，“城市倾斜”政策越来越厉害，国家对农业的投入和扶持逐年减少，使农产品和工业品的比价不合理，严重地挫伤了农民的种田积极性。另外，在农业内部，由于价值规律的作用，种粮种棉经济效益低，难以致富，是一种牺牲。于是，农民纷纷转向种收入高的经济作物，致使粮棉种植面积有所下降。仅靠农民作出“牺牲”来发展粮棉生产不是长远之计，随着农民商品经济意识的增强，这种办法越来越不灵了。如果要从根本上解决问题，还是必须按价值规律办事，逐步理顺价格关系，以此调动农民种粮种棉的积极性。
