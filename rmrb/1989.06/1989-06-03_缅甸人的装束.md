The Burmese people, regardless of age or gender, wear a garment called a "longyi," which wraps around the waist and hangs down to the ankles. The colors are vibrant, including green, purple, and yellow. Most men prefer large, bold patterns, while women often choose floral prints. The length of the longyi is one to two times the wearer's waist circumference, and it can be put on and taken off without needing a belt or string. However, men and women wear it differently: men tie a knot in front, while women tuck it in tightly on the right side without a knot.

The Burmese people's choice of the longyi is closely related to the climate. Burma is a tropical country where people sweat profusely during the day. Taking a shower or washing is an essential part of daily life. When showering outdoors, the longyi can be used as a curtain; at night, it can be pulled up to use as a blanket.

Burmese men typically wear a short-sleeved, buttoned-up shirt without a collar, while women wear a similar shirt but with an angled collar. Men often wear a "gaung baung," which is a plain-colored scarf or silk cloth wrapped around the head, serving as a "hat." Women prefer to adorn their hair with flowers. The Burmese people do not wear socks and go barefoot, wearing slippers instead. Of course, in modern Burma, it has become more common for upper-class individuals to wear Western-style suits and trousers.

    缅甸人的装束
    ●易军芳
    缅甸人不论男女老幼都穿着上围腰部、下垂脚踵的“纱笼”，色彩鲜明，绿、紫、黄都有。大多数男性喜欢大方格花纹，女性却以花布居多。纱笼的围长为腰围的一至两倍，穿脱不用系扎腰带绳索。但男女穿法却有区别，男人穿着时在腰前纽成一个结，女人则在右侧腰间抽紧塞住，没有结蒂。
    缅甸人穿纱笼与气候有直接关系。缅甸是一个热带国家，白天汗流浃背，洗澡冲凉是生活中必不可少的。在露天冲凉时，解开纱笼可作围帐；夜间睡觉时，拉上一点可作毯子盖在身上。
    缅甸男人的上装是对襟长袖短衫，女人却是斜襟长袖短衫，但都没有领子。男人头带“岗朋”，即用一条素色薄纱或丝巾扎在头上，作为“礼帽”。妇女喜欢以插花作为头饰。缅甸人与袜无缘，长年赤脚穿拖鞋。当然，现代缅甸上层社会人士穿西装长裤已较为流行了。
