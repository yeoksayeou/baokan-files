Dreams and Reality

About four months ago, Ricardo was kicked out of his home for smoking marijuana and ended up wandering the streets of Mexico City. In just over 100 days, he became deeply involved in theft and drug trafficking, no longer appearing to be a 15-year-old boy.

Children like Ricardo are not only found in Mexico City but also in many developing countries' major cities. Experts estimate that there are at least 100 million such "street children" worldwide. During the day, they sell cigarettes, candy, and flowers to tourists or get entangled in criminal activities; at night, they huddle in dark doorways or lie lazily on the sidewalks. Some young girls end up in the "red-light district." Among them are orphans and those abandoned by their families, but most have homes and return at night. The number of "street children" is increasing, drawing attention from around the world.

The causes of this phenomenon are numerous, but the fundamental one is the rapid population growth, economic stagnation, and heavy debts in these countries. Many families struggle to make ends meet, often forcing young children to go out and earn money to make up the shortfall or fend for themselves.

These children, once on the streets, are influenced and lured by various dark forces in society, engaging in pickpocketing, drug trafficking, prostitution, and other activities. They find that this way of earning money is much easier than peddling small items or begging on the streets, and better than staying at home. Some young girls, seeking a better life, follow foreign tourists into prostitution, even if the pay is meager. Some children develop drug habits and, to afford more drugs, resort to dangerous crimes like murder, becoming a source of social unrest.

Some governments and charitable organizations have tried various methods to save these unfortunate children. Some have made films about "street children" to raise societal awareness. A Spanish priest who has worked in Rio de Janeiro for many years spent several nights living on the streets with these children, having heart-to-heart talks to inspire their self-respect. Indeed, some children have awakened from this experience. However, such good deeds are like a drop in the bucket.

The large number of children wandering the streets reflects many problems these countries face. Without fundamental measures to improve these countries' economic conditions, how can these children escape their plight? Currently, some governments are heavily in debt and cannot allocate sufficient funds for social relief. Although they have repeatedly mobilized private enterprises to fund relief efforts, there is much talk but little action, with minimal results.

Rafael is an 11-year-old boy from the Philippines who joined the ranks of Manila's "street children" two years ago. His thoughts are somewhat representative. He sees street life as his path to development. He wants to go to school but prefers the free and easy life on the streets. He admits to feeling sad or fearful in daily life but finds joy in street life. A dream drives him to keep living: with his "street smarts" and skills learned from the underworld, he believes he can one day live like the children of the rich, driving luxury cars and enjoying a good life. He dare not wake up from this dream because reality is too harsh for these children.

　　梦想与现实
    ４个多月前，利卡多因吸大麻叶被家庭赶了出来，在墨西哥城街头流浪。在短短１００多天里，他越陷越深，很快成了行窃、贩毒的“老手”，看上去不再像１５岁的少年了。
    像利卡多这样的孩子，不仅在墨西哥城有千千万，而且遍及许多发展中国家的大城市。据专家们估计，在世界上这样的“街头儿童”至少有１亿多。白天，他们上街向游客兜售纸烟、糖果、鲜花，或卷入黑社会的旋涡，跟着干起犯罪勾当；晚上，他们挤在黑暗的门洞里，或懒散地躺在街头人行道上，有的年轻姑娘进入了“红灯区”。他们中有孤儿、被家庭遗弃者，但多数是有家的，白天出来活动，晚上回家过宿。“街头儿童”的人数在日益增加，这引起了世人的关注。
    造成上述现象的原因很多，基本的一条是，随着这些国家人口的急剧增加、经济停滞，再加上外债累累，越来越多的家庭入不敷出，很难维持生活的基本需要，只好让年幼的孩子上街挣钱，以补不足，或任其自谋生存。
    这些孩子走上街头受社会上各种黑暗势力的影响和勾引，干起了扒手、贩毒、娼妓等勾当。他们觉得，这样得到的钱远比沿街做小买卖或乞讨要容易得多，比在家里生活也好得多。有的年轻姑娘追求好吃好住，就跟着外国旅游者卖身，即使报酬十分低微，也不在乎。有的儿童染上了吸毒的恶习，为了获取足够钱去买毒品，就铤而走险，去杀人害命，成了社会不安宁的因素。
    一些国家政府和慈善救济机关为挽救这群可怜的孩子，想了各种办法。有的拍了有关“街头儿童”的电影，以唤起全社会的关注。一位在里约热内卢工作多年的西班牙神父接连几夜亲自上街跟这些孩子们生活在一起，促膝谈心，以激发他们的自爱之心。的确，有的孩子就此醒悟过来。但是，这种善举毕竟是杯水车薪。
    如此众多的孩子流浪街头，实际上反映了这些国家所面临的许多问题的一个侧面。不从根本上采取措施去改善这些国家的经济状况，又怎能使他们跳出火海呢？目前，一些国家政府负债累累，拨不出足够资金用于社会救济，虽多次动员私人企业出资办一些救济事业，但说的多做的少，成效甚微。
    拉法尔是菲律宾的一个１１岁的男孩，两年前离家加入了马尼拉“街头儿童”的行列。他的想法倒有一定代表性。他视流浪生活为自己发展的方向。他想去上学，但更喜欢街头自由自在的生活。他承认在日常生活中也感到悲伤或恐惶，但觉得流浪生活有自己的乐趣。一种梦幻激励着他生活下去：凭他的“小聪明”、用黑社会学到的“本领”，有朝一日会像富裕人家的孩子那样坐上豪华的小汽车，过着美好的生活。他不敢从这种梦境里醒悟过来，因为现实对这些孩子实在太残酷了。
