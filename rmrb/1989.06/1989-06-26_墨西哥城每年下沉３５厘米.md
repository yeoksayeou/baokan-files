Mexico City sinks 35 centimeters annually. Due to the large-scale extraction of groundwater, the world's most populous city, Mexico City, has sunk nearly 8 meters since the beginning of this century.

According to a survey report from the Institute of Physics and Engineering at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, currently, the 18 million residents of Mexico City consume 55 cubic meters of water per second for their daily lives. With the population growth, by the end of this century, the city's water consumption will increase to 130 cubic meters per second.

Mexico City is located in the central highland basin of Mexico. In recent years, Mexico City's industrial development has been rapid. Now, 50% of the country's factories are concentrated here. The increase in industrial water use has further accelerated the rate of ground subsidence. Currently, Mexico City sinks an average of 35 centimeters per year.

　　墨西哥城每年下沉３５厘米
    由于地下水被大量抽取，世界人口最多的都市墨西哥城从本世纪初以来已经下沉近８米。
    据墨西哥国立自治大学物理和工程学院的一项调查报告，目前，墨西哥城１８００万居民的生活用水量每秒达５５立方米。随着人口的增长，到本世纪末该城生活用水量将增加到每秒１３０立方米。
    墨西哥城位于墨西哥中部高原谷地。近年来，墨西哥城工业发展迅速。现在，全国５０％的工厂集中在这里。工业用水增加更加剧了地面下沉的速度。目前，墨西哥城每年平均下沉３５厘米。
