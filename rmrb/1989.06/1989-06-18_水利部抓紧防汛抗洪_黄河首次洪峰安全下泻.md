The Ministry of Water Resources is taking concrete steps to ensure effective flood control and drought relief, guaranteeing the safety of major rivers and key cities during the flood season, and securing a bumper harvest this year to contribute to the stabilization of the situation.

Currently, major rivers across China have entered the flood season. To ensure effective flood control this year, the State Flood Control Headquarters began 24-hour duty a month earlier on May 11, ensuring normal command and dispatch during the flood season. From June 6 to 7, the first flood peak of the year occurred in the upper reaches of the Huai River. After several days and nights of command and dispatch, it has safely passed. Now, all flood control materials and equipment have been stockpiled, emergency vehicles and fuel, as well as the pre-allocated 30 million yuan of emergency engineering funds, have been issued one and a half months in advance.

The first flood peak of the Yellow River has also safely passed. This is the first time in history that the Yellow River has successfully navigated a flood peak. The successful navigation of the flood peak is a result of the concerted efforts of the relevant departments and the local governments. The Ministry of Water Resources will continue to strengthen the supervision and inspection of the flood control work, and ensure the safety of the major rivers and key cities during the flood season.
