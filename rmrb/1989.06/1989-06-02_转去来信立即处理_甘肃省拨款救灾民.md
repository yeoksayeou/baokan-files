On December 12th of last year, Mr. Junji from Peking University wrote to our newspaper, recounting his observations from the flood-stricken areas of Qingyang, Gansu Province:

In July 1988, the areas of Xifeng City and Qingyang County in Qingyang Prefecture experienced an unprecedented severe flood. Thousands of farmers' homes were destroyed, and many disaster victims were left homeless. Recently, I visited the disaster-stricken areas and was deeply concerned by what I saw and heard.

About 7 kilometers from Xifeng City, along the Fenghuan Highway, near the mud-brick caves destroyed by the flood, three disaster-stricken households had set up small tarpaulin shacks. An elderly woman with white hair told me that on the night the flood occurred, the water rushed into the cave, and her entire family miraculously survived, but all the grain they had just harvested and all their belongings were swept away by the flood. After the disaster, the family had nothing left. The government provided each household with a loan of 400 yuan, which was used to buy a few pieces of clothing and utensils for daily necessities, leaving almost nothing. The remaining relief funds and supplies have not yet been distributed to these severely affected households.

Since the winter, many disaster victims living in makeshift shelters have lacked fuel, food, and basic winter clothing, making their situation extremely difficult.

On December 23rd, 1988, our newspaper forwarded Mr. Junji's letter to the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China. On March 21st, 1989, the Gansu Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China's Letter and Visit Office sent a reply:

The letter from Mr. Junji reflecting the difficulties faced by disaster victims in Qingyang Prefecture during the harsh winter has been highly valued by the provincial party committee and government leaders. They have sent personnel to the area multiple times to distribute funds and provide relief. As of now, the provincial Civil Affairs Bureau has allocated 2.2 million yuan in disaster relief funds, which has basically resolved the difficulties faced by the disaster victims.

    甘肃省拨款救灾民
    去年１２月１２日，北京大学峻极同志给本报来信，讲述了他在甘肃庆阳地区洪灾区的见闻：
    １９８８年７月，庆阳地区西峰市、庆阳县一带遭受到罕见的特大洪灾，数千户农民房倒窑塌，许多灾民无家可归。前不久，我到灾区去了一趟，所见所闻，令人忧虑。
    在距西峰市７公里处的凤环公路旁，在洪水冲毁的黄土窑洞旁，有３户灾民搭的油毡小棚。一位白发老太太讲，洪灾发生的那天深夜，洪水冲进窑洞，全家人侥幸保全性命，但刚收获的粮食和所有家当转眼间就被洪水淹没。灾后，全家一无所有。政府给每户发放的４００元贷款，购买少许衣裤和锅碗粮盐等生活必需品后，所剩无几，今年根本无力建房。其它救灾钱物，尚未落实到他们这类重灾户手中。
    入冬以来，很多栖身棚帐内的灾民，既缺燃料、食物，又没有起码的防寒服装，境况十分艰难。
    １９８８年１２月２３日，本报将峻极同志的这封来信转给中共甘肃省委。１９８９年３月２１日，中共甘肃省委信访室寄来了答复信：
    峻极同志来信反映庆阳地区灾民在严冬中境况艰难的问题，省委、省政府领导同志很重视，多次派人带款到当地进行了安置。截至目前，省民政厅已拨救灾款２２０万元，基本解决了灾民的困难。
