Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 25th.

The Chinese Academy of Sciences Party Group held an expanded meeting from yesterday afternoon to today to study and discuss the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee. They are determined to lead the 90,000 scientific and technical personnel and staff of the entire academy to adhere to the fundamental principles of the nation, walk the path to a strong country, and make greater contributions to the construction of the Four Modernizations and the revitalization of China.

In the letter to the Party Central Committee passed at the meeting, the Chinese Academy of Sciences Party Group expressed full support for the series of speeches made by Comrade Deng Xiaoping recently, full support for Comrade Jiang Zemin as the General Secretary of the Party, full support for the report on the errors made by Comrade Zhao Ziyang passed at the Fourth Plenary Session, and full support for the personnel adjustments made by the Party Central Committee leadership.

Academician and Party Group Secretary Zhou Guangzhao, in connection with the historical facts of the achievements made by the Chinese scientific and technological team under the long-term cultivation of the Party and the display of the superiority of the socialist system, believed that only by adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up can various undertakings be revitalized, and China have a bright future. He said, in the face of this serious political struggle, the broad masses of scientific and technological personnel in the Chinese Academy of Sciences have shown good performance, are thinking of stability, opposing turmoil, and are reliable. In the face of a series of difficulties facing the country, we scientific and technological personnel should, as always, be in heart with the Party, adhere to self-reliance, work hard, speed up the development of science and technology, and promote the development of the national economy.

The expanded meeting of the Chinese Academy of Sciences Party Group believed that Fang Lizhi and a few people who created turmoil and conspired to overthrow the socialist system do not represent the broad masses of intellectuals. They are the dregs of scientific and technological personnel. The broad masses of scientific and technological personnel should draw a clear line with them and expose and condemn their conspiracies.

Academician Zhou Guangzhao said in his speech on opening up to the outside world that over the past decade, the Chinese Academy of Sciences and the scientific community and scientists of various countries have developed friendly cooperative relations. Now, although some problems have arisen, we believe that the facts will eventually be understood by the broad foreign colleagues. As long as we adhere to the policy of opening up to the outside world and maintain a stable and united situation, the exchange and cooperation between our academy and the scientific community of various countries will definitely be further developed.

Yesterday evening to today, from the rocket and satellite launch base to the aerospace telemetry center, from the "Far Horizon" measurement ship to the conventional weapons test center and nuclear test base, whether it is the national defense science and technology commission leadership agency stationed in Beijing or the national defense science and technology workers fighting in the desert, mountains, grasslands, and islands, they all listened to and watched the radio and television news about the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee with excitement. Everyone expressed their firm support for the various decisions made at the Plenary Session, firm support for the new central leadership core after the adjustment, and determination to do a better job in the various work of the National Defense Science and Technology Commission under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, and to make up for the losses caused by the turmoil and riots with practical actions.

The Party Committee of the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, under the leadership of Secretary Ding Henggao and Deputy Secretary Ying Yongning, seriously studied and discussed the Plenary Session communiqué. Ding Henggao said after conveying the relevant spirit of the Central Plenary Session: This meeting is of great significance not only for further stabilizing the national situation at present but also for ensuring the continuity of the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee in the future, which will have a far-reaching impact.

The National Defense Science and Technology Commission issued a notice to its subordinate units, requiring all levels of party committees to seriously study and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, and comprehensively strengthen the construction of the troops. Zhang Xiaode, the major general and director of the Jiuquan Satellite Launch Center, who is executing the new rocket launch test mission, said: "The decision to adjust the central leadership core and handle the issue of Comrade Zhao Ziyang and other issues made by the Plenary Session is completely correct and necessary." Wang Hao, the political commissar of the National University of Defense Technology, said: "The older generation of proletarian revolutionaries represented by Comrade Deng Xiaoping played a decisive role in this struggle. We are determined to do a good job in scientific research and teaching, and strive to achieve the Party's short-term and long-term goals."
