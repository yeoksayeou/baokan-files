The White House, this world-renowned ancient building, always undergoes some changes whenever a new U.S. president takes office.

In early March, I had the fortune to walk through the corridors of the White House. Without asking, one could tell who the new owner is, as the walls on both sides of the corridor are filled with photographs of President Bush at work and in his personal life. Among them is a large photograph of Deng Xiaoping meeting Bush in Beijing.

From a tourist's perspective, the large and small halls in the White House can be divided into two functions: museum and activity room. It is called a museum because it preserves furniture and decorative items added by each U.S. president since 1800, except for President Washington. From here, one can see the different aesthetic tastes and artistic preferences of each president and their spouses. In the porcelain display room, the porcelain tableware left by President Hayes, who reigned from 1877 to 1881, is particularly distinctive, as each porcelain item is decorated with an image of the food it is meant to hold.

There is a porcelain plate with a large turkey on it, which makes one's appetite increase. What is particularly amusing is that a porcelain plate has a pattern of snow boots on it, originally used to hold ice cream. Of course, since President Bush took over the White House, another type of food—Chinese cuisine—has become even more popular among Americans. Under the president's influence, people have started using a new proverb to describe this "China craze": a father who does not take his children to a Chinese restaurant at least once a week is not a good father.

The large and small display rooms in the White House also preserve many valuable Chinese porcelain items and other exhibits. In the 17th, 18th, and 19th centuries in America, owning Chinese porcelain was a symbol of wealth, and the president was no exception. Now, Chinese carpets, porcelain, screens, and other items occupy important positions in the Green Room, Blue Room, and Red Room of the White House.

The other function of the White House's halls is as a living space for the president's family and a workplace for the president. Therefore, each president arranges the White House according to their own preferences. In the Cabinet Room, Bush added a chair that is two inches higher than the other seats (Reagan's chair was bought by his cabinet members as a memento when he left office) and hung several portraits of former presidents that he personally selected: Lincoln, Jefferson, Roosevelt, and Eisenhower.

Walking past the Cabinet Room, one enters the familiar Oval Office. Here, the new president, Bush, has rearranged it according to his preferences: the American flag and the presidential flag are inserted behind the president's desk, and the walls around it are decorated with oil paintings and photographs related to naval life, which he loved in his early years as a naval aviator. On the bookshelf, there is a bronze sculpture depicting a thrilling scene: a shepherd riding a horse across the grass, the horse's hoof stepping on a rattlesnake, the horse jumping in surprise... the image is very lifelike.

Additionally, in the small space of the Oval Office, there are four quite large Chinese porcelain vases. Two are lamp bases, and two are decorative items. This again shows President Bush's interest in collecting Chinese art and his fond memories of the time he worked and lived in China.

　　换了新主人的白宫
    年文
    白宫，这座举世闻名的古老建筑物，每当新一任美国总统就职之后，都会因新主人的迁入而发生一些变化。
    ３月初的一个晚上，我有幸步入白宫走廊。不用问就知道现在的新主人是谁了，因为走廊两壁挂满了布什总统的工作照片和生活照片。其中一幅大型照片是邓小平在北京会见布什时的情景。
    用一个旅游者的眼光看，白宫大大小小的厅室可分为博物馆和活动室两种功用。说它是博物馆，是因为这里珍藏着自１８００年以来除华盛顿总统以外的历任总统添置的家具和陈设装饰品。从这里人们不难看出每位总统及其夫人不同的审美风格和艺术爱好。在瓷器陈列室里，１８７７年至１８８１年在位的海斯总统留下的一套瓷器餐具最具特色，因为每一瓷器盛放什么食品，瓷具上便绘制着什么图案。
    有一只瓷盘上画了一只大火鸡，令人食欲倍增。特别令人忍俊不禁的是，一只瓷盘上的图案是雪靴靴底，原来这只盘子是用来盛冰激凌的。当然，布什总统入主白宫以后，也有一种食品——中国菜更加受美国人欢迎了。在总统的影响下，人们开始用一句新谚语形容这种“中国热”：哪个父亲不带子女每周上一次中国菜馆，便不是好父亲。
    白宫大大小小的陈列室里还保存着不少珍贵的中国瓷器和其他陈列品。在１７、１８、１９世纪的美国，拥有中国瓷器是富贵的标志，总统也不例外。现在，白宫的绿屋、蓝屋和红屋内陈列的中国地毯、瓷器、屏风等等都占有重要的地位。
    白宫厅室的另一功用，是作为总统一家生活的场所和总统工作场所。所以每一任总统都按照自己的爱好布置白宫。在内阁会议室，布什除了添置一张比其他座椅高两英寸的总统座椅（里根的座椅已在离任时由其阁僚们凑钱买回为他作了纪念品）外，墙上还悬挂着他亲自挑选的几幅前总统的画像：林肯、杰斐逊、老罗斯福、艾森豪威尔。
    走过内阁会议室，就是人们熟悉的椭圆形办公室。这里新总统布什已按照自己的爱好将它布置一新：总统办公桌后插着美国国旗和总统旗，周围墙壁上挂着这个早年海军航空兵喜爱的有关海军生活油画和照片。书架上的一个铜塑像描写了一个惊险场面：牧童骑马过草地，马蹄踩了响尾蛇，马惊跳起来……那形象十分逼真。
    另外，在椭圆形办公室的小小空间里，还摆有四个相当大的中国瓷瓶。两个是台灯灯座，两个是陈设品。这又说明布什总统对收藏中国工艺品的爱好及他对在中国曾经工作生活过一个时期的怀念。
