Yuan Jianmin was elected as the vice county magistrate of Tashkurgan County at the county people's congress when he was not yet 30 years old. This Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County is located on the distant Pamir Mountains, bordering three countries: the Soviet Union, Afghanistan, and Pakistan. It is the only county in our country that connects three national borders. From a geographical perspective, it is also the westernmost county in our country. Here, the mountains tower high, with an average elevation of 4,000 meters. The total area of the county is over 67,600 square kilometers. This is a place filled with legends and mystery.

The Eagle's Dream

Xinjiang attracts people from the interior with its vastness, magic, and beauty. Especially the young men and women from the interior, they are deeply infatuated with Xinjiang. Who can forget in the early 1960s, a newsreel titled "Joyous Tian Shan" and a documentary about the romantic life of the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps, "The Song of Military Farming," were shown in Shanghai for a week, attracting tens of thousands of young men and women from Shanghai to leave their families and the Huangpu River to embrace the vast land of Xinjiang...

Today's young men and women think more deeply and are more discerning about life. Their horizons are broader, but they still yearn for Xinjiang. For the snow lotus of Tian Shan, the grasslands of Yili, the love songs of Kashgar, the grapes of Turpan, the girls of Dabancheng... or something else, they jump onto the westbound train like going to a disco with friends, heading to Xinjiang, heading to Tian Shan.

Yuan Jianmin is one of them.

This clever young man is full of imagination. At 15, he was a high school student at the Ninth Middle School in Taizhou, Jiangsu, and wrote a poem titled "The Cleaning Worker," which was published in the Taizhou Youth Newspaper and won the first prize in the city's middle school essay competition. Then, this poem was selected for publication in the New China Daily. Yuan Jianmin became the outstanding student of the middle school and the "news figure" of the entire school. He was the top student in his class and should have gone to college. However, his love for imagination changed his fate.

In 1975, he graduated from high school and had the audacious idea of going to Xinjiang. That year, he was 16.

At 16, the young man had even bolder, more romantic, and more reckless aspirations. He arrived in Xinjiang, unyielding by the Taklamakan Desert, unobstructed by the snowstorms of Junggar, and uncharmed by the yogurt by the Yarkand River. He traveled from his hometown of Taizhou to Urumqi by train for a week, then by bus for another week to Kashgar. Then, facing the swirling snowstorms, he climbed the towering Pamir Mountains. He rode a yak and settled in Wacha Township, Tashkurgan Tajik Autonomous County, becoming a herder.

This is a world of dreams.

Ice peaks, snow mountains, and wilderness. Cow dung is used as fuel, and cave dwellings are homes. The Pamir Plateau is a world where all the big and small mountains are covered with ice and snow. Muztagh Ata, Kelu'erke, and Kongur. The Jomolhari Peak here is the second-highest peak in the world, with an elevation of 8,611 meters; the "Father of Ice Mountains," Muztagh Ata, has an elevation of 7,546 meters, with ice thickness reaching 50-70 meters, and a glacier coverage area of 200 square kilometers.

Wacha Township is nestled among these snow-capped peaks.

Yuan Jianmin lived in a small stone house he built himself, which was drafty on all four sides. With him was his high school classmate, Bian Honglin (this Bian Honglin, who once lived in a stone house, is now the director of the county construction bureau). Stepping out of the stone house, there were mountains to the left, mountains to the right, mountains in front, and mountains behind, as if trapped in a cage of snow mountains. There were 354 households of Tajik herders living here. The Tajiks are an ancient, pure, and passionate ethnic group. Guests who come on horseback hand over their whips to the host, and the host will invite them to stay the night. The host welcomes the guest into the yurt, spreads out sheep skins for them to sit on, and then helps the guest take off their shoes. Then, the host brings in a sheep—this sheep is specially slaughtered to entertain the guest.

Yuan Jianmin was not a passing guest. Although he came from thousands of miles away, he wanted to be a herder's eagle here. The Tajik herders welcomed him and paid attention to him. In this narrow, long snow valley, he was the first Han person to settle down since ancient times. Moreover, this young man with no mustache on his lips was not handing over his whip to the herders to drink milk tea, eat mutton, and sit on the sheep skins they had prepared, but was building a small stone house with stones and living there.

The herders were surprised for a while, watched for a while, and this stone house could not block the biting wind and snow, but it captured the heart of this young Han man. They sent milk and mutton into this stone house, gave him horses and whips, and called him to go herding, to slaughter sheep, to pick up cow dung, to wrestle, to race horses, and to dance with the girls in a unique way.

Here, one could hardly eat wheat flour, rice, vegetables, or fruits all year round, eating only barley flatbread, thick tea brewed from brick tea, and never feeling full, and eating too much would cause bleeding. He felt lost. But a surge of hot blood only created a small whirlpool and then surged forward again. Riding a horse, herding sheep, stepping out of this narrow snow valley, everywhere was a vast and beautiful grassland (he later found out that the slopes around this snow valley had over 150,000 mu of natural grasslands). Gradually, he worked with the herders from sunrise to sunset, dressed like a mountain dweller, and was truly a Tajik herder. Living with the Tajiks all day, he was so intelligent and eager to learn that he learned the Tajik language in just a year and communicated with the villagers in Tajik. From then on, the pure herders had a leap in their feelings for him. From then on, he often sat in the herders' yurts, surrounded by the roaring fire of cow, horse, and donkey dung, quietly listening to the Tajik elders telling legends that flowed like mountain springs. He rode on the yaks migrating to new pastures, listening intently to the soul-stirring love songs of the Tajik men and women. He drove a donkey to the mountains dozens of miles away to collect firewood and pick up cow, horse, and donkey dung. Looking at the blue sky of the plateau, the white ice mountains, the green meadows, the babbling streams, the darting foxes, and the soaring snowcocks... he was captivated and intoxicated by all this. The spirit and culture of this ancient nation gave him a cultural refinement. He absorbed, pondered, and imagined. He eagerly wanted to know more and deeper about this nation and to tell everyone what he knew and felt. During this time, he wrote over ten thousand words of diary entries. He gradually truly tasted the sweetness of Tajik milk tea, the mellowness of yogurt, and the fragrance of barley flatbread... The Tajik people are pure and passionate, and they also fell in love with this Han young man. One day, the deputy secretary of the township party committee, Muzhala Buyimaiti, patted Yuan Jianmin's shoulder and asked, "Young friend, how old are you?" Yuan Jianmin said, "In two months, I will be eighteen." Muzhala Buyimaiti squinted his eyes, looked at him for a while, and said, "It's clear that you have fallen in love with our Pamirs, fallen in love with our Tajik people. You are not an ordinary guest. The Tajiks are the descendants of eagles, and you are a little eagle in the Pamirs, soaring in the wind and snow on the snow mountains. You will fly higher and higher. The Communist Party is the savior of the Tajik people. You are a son of the Tajik people and should also be a son of the Party."

Soon, Yuan Jianmin became a member of the Communist Party of China in Wacha Township. This was April 1976, and he had just turned eighteen.

He could not remain calm.

When the yurt was filled with the sweet scent of milk and butter, he quietly walked out of the stone house and lit a bonfire under the ice mountain. Under the firelight, his emotions surged. Nearby were the village, the yurt, and an ancient, dried-up river, stars, the moon, and the ice mountain glowing in the moonlight. This flickering flame was the only light for hundreds or thousands of miles around. He looked up and thought of his childhood and youth, his friends, his family, and his kind mother. What were they doing at this moment? He longed for them and also longed for the lovely hometown of Taizhou, the bustling asphalt roads, and the neon lights on both sides of the roads. Suddenly, someone in the distance played the eagle flute, the melody was distant and high, what was it telling? Was it the fragrance of the soil here? Was it a joyful pastoral song? Or was it the magical history of the Pamirs and this ancient, pure nation? No. Perhaps it was the Tajiks' hope for the future? The bonfire burned brighter, he took out his diary, wanting to write an entry, wanting to write letters to his mother and family. But the words he wrote in the diary were "I Love You, Pamirs!" Was this the title of an essay? At this moment, the floating flute melody came to his side, a few Tajik young men and women came to him: "Friend, what are you writing alone here? Such a good bonfire, come! Let's dance together!"

The bonfire burned brighter again.

The Sentimental Pamirs

The Pamirs have boundless charm for both domestic and foreign visitors.

But how much do people know about the magic of the Pamirs?

Yuan Jianmin herded under a glacier, and an old Tajik herder pointed to a distant snow peak shrouded in clouds and mist and said to him, "On the top of this glacier, there lies a herder girl, who has been there for several hundred years."

"Really?" He was amazed.

"She is still beautiful and intact." The old herder slowly told him in a deep voice. "She has a stunning appearance, a melodious voice, her delicate skin makes the snow lotus on the ice peak pale in comparison, and her clear voice can dispel the howling winds. She jumped into a deep ice valley because she would not submit to the humiliation and bullying of the herder chief. No one knows how many years have passed, an old herder found her. People admire her beauty, respect her chastity, and praise her bravery, placing her on this high ice peak, letting the sunlight warm her heart. From then on, on sunny days, the snow mountain is crystal clear under the sunlight. People look at the ice peak that reaches the sky, and at this time, the ice peak is always covered by beautiful clouds. Someone has seen the clouds open like a fan, and the beautiful herder girl stands on the ice peak, looking at the endless snow mountains."

Soon, his essay "I Love You, Pamirs" was published in the third issue of Xinjiang Literature in 1980, carrying the unique spirit and passion of the plateau. Following that, in 1983, the essay "Beautiful Night in the Pamirs" was published in the World Language Edition of China Report and introduced abroad. In 1984, the essay "Fairy Tale Pamirs" was selected into the Chinese Minority Literature Series and became a teaching material for the Central Institute for Nationalities, attracting people's attention. At this time, Yuan Jianmin had been transferred to the county government office to work as a secretary. The change in environment and improvement in conditions allowed him to know more and better about the Pamirs and the Tajiks. He often went to the countryside and returned to the unforgettable Wacha Township, which was 85 kilometers away from the county seat and had the highest elevation in the county. With greater interest and passion, he visited those unfamiliar places. His Tajik language became more fluent. He dressed like a herder, and in addition to his notebook, he also carried a small tape recorder. He and a few comrades wanted to cross a river in the Tashkurgan gorge. This river was over 300 meters wide, with water so green it turned blue, so blue it turned green, and so green it turned black. Standing on the steep riverbank and looking down, it was terrifying. The water was so turbulent, and the river surface was constantly rolling with lines and clusters of dazzling white waves, roaring and surging, rushing northward without stopping. Upstream and downstream, as far as the eye could see, there was no sign of a bridge. Only one place had a few thin iron cables. The cables were constantly vibrating and seemed to be lightly floating upstream. The wooden planks, sticks, and branches that were originally laid on the cables were broken, loose, or hanging upside down. Most places had nothing left, only a few black cables. Who set up these cables and when, and how long they had been there, no one knew anymore.

"We can't cross, and if we do, we have to find another way," a few comrades reminded Yuan Jianmin.

Yuan Jianmin then thought of the remote nomadic area on the other side of the river, where people said it had long been isolated from the world. He said, "No! We've come this far, and there's no other way. The water is so fast, and on this Pamir Plateau, even with ten thousand taels of gold, we can't find a boat. I'll go first." Saying this, he tied a rope around his waist and handed one end to his companion: "If I fall, pull the rope tightly, don't panic, I can swim." Finishing, he stepped onto the bridge. Where there were wooden planks, he moved his feet lightly; when he encountered the round sticks, he crouched and moved past. In the middle of the bridge, there were no planks or branches on the cables, making one's heart tremble. Yuan Jianmin lay flat on the ground, grabbed the front cable with both hands, and kicked the back cable with both feet, moving inch by inch to the side. He dared not take a breath or look down. It took him over three hours to safely reach the other side of the 300-meter-wide river. Later, he led his comrades across this iron cable many times.

His horizons became broader, his materials became richer, and his love for every inch of the Pamirs deepened. In a few years, 30 pieces of reportage and lyrical essays, pouring out a southern youth's unique feelings for the plateau, were published in newspapers and magazines such as People's Daily, Essay, and Xinjiang Youth. He was admitted to the Kashgar Regional Writers' Association and joined the Xinjiang Ethnic Literature Research Association, gradually entering the study and discussion of the entire Tajik ethnic literature, conducting comprehensive research and verification on the ethnicity, history, culture, religion, and customs of the Tajik people. On September 11, 1987, he was elected as the vice county magistrate and made a few minutes of inaugural speech to 106 people's representatives, saying: "I am cultivated by the Party for a long time, cared for by the Tajik people for a long time, and have today's achievements. I have eaten the salt and milk tea of the Tajik people, and I will definitely contribute all my strength to the revitalization of this nation and let more and more people know and love the Tajiks."

He spoke these words in Tajik. His speech lasted only a few minutes, but the applause lasted much longer.

The True Description Lies in the Future

Last summer, I met Yuan Jianmin in Kashgar. He was a member of the Chinese local government delegation here, negotiating with the Pakistani government delegation on issues related to the Red Mountain Pass. Located between two mountains on the Pamir Plateau, the Red Mountain Pass, meaning "Blood Valley," was once a place where bandits and frequent battles occurred. Since the Chinese government announced its opening to the world in 1986, in just over two years, over 60,000 people have entered and exited through this pass, and over 7,000 vehicles have entered and exited. People from the five continents, businessmen, diplomats, mountaineers, explorers, pilgrims, visitors, journalists, and trade caravans have entered China through this pass, known as the "Western Gate" of China's openness and friendship. This negotiation involved a wide range of issues between the two sides. Yuan Jianmin proposed developing tourism in the Pamirs. He said that friends from the five continents entering China through the Red Mountain Pass could directly go down the mountain to the hometown of the Uyghurs in Kashgar, go to the ancient city of Kuche and Turpan, Urumqi, and like Marco Polo and the Swedish explorer Sven Hedin, after reaching Kashgar, cross the Taklamakan Desert or circle the Tarim Basin. However, the magical Pamirs and the ancient Tajik people also have boundless charm. At this point, he listed the stone ancient city, the princess castle, the apricot village, the Karakul Lake, the Taman hot spring, and the general's cave and the colored stone mountain standing on the high ice mountain in the Pamirs. He told the guests: "Our Tashkurgan County recently purchased ten luxury vans equipped with air conditioning and audio equipment to receive friends from Pakistan and the five continents." The speech of this young and elegant vice county magistrate aroused great interest from the leader of the Pakistani government delegation, the administrative head of the northern region, Abdul Khayyum Khan. He said, "Yuan's speech should be known to more people. I have been to the Taman hot spring. It is so magical. It is in the depths of the Muztagh Ata ice mountain, at an elevation of 3,200 meters. The temperature in summer is minus 30 degrees Celsius, but this hot spring is boiling, emitting puffs of hot air, with a temperature of 80 degrees Celsius. I threw in an egg, and it was cooked in a moment. It is said that the water in this ice mountain hot spring contains 23 elements and can cure several diseases. Also, the Tajiks can make a flute from an eagle's bone and play such a beautiful melody, which is incredible." Abdul Khayyum Khan, of course, would not have thought that this young Chinese government official had already served as the director of the foreign affairs office of Tashkurgan County in his twenties. However, Abdul Khayyum Khan saw from the young official's speech and demeanor a Han person's deep affection for the Pamirs and the Tajiks.

During the day, Yuan Jianmin sat in a conference room with Kashgar carpets on the floor and walls, negotiating with the delegation and accompanying them to visit the tomb of the Fragrant Concubine and the Id Kah Mosque. At night, in the hotel next to us, the music was playing, I knocked on Yuan Jianmin's room, and he was writing at his desk. A thick stack of large white paper, with tens of thousands of words, titled: "The Descendants of Eagles - Pamir Scenery and Tajik Customs Exhibition."

This exhibition will soon open in the capital. The entire exhibition plan and explanation were jointly written by him and Zhou Guoxing of the Beijing Museum of Natural History. Thousands of items, thousands of real objects and charts, spanning thousands of years up and down, thousands of miles across. He had revised it countless times and was still polishing and revising. "This is a grand project, the first in the history of the Pamirs."

When our conversation turned to this exhibition, Yuan Jianmin was full of emotions. He said that in January of this year, he and the county magistrate, Abuzaer Helili, went to Beijing to find relevant departments of the central government to build a hydropower station. They had worked on this for ten years, with the county's report sent to the prefecture, the prefecture to the autonomous region, and the autonomous region to the central government. Some people working in certain departments of the central government knew nothing about this county, this ethnic group, or this Pamir region. Yuan Jianmin said, "You have never heard of this place, and we have fought for eleven years, run for eleven years!" Then, pointing to Abuzaer Helili, he said, "He is the county magistrate, the sixth and seventh session of the People's Congress representative, and I am the vice county magistrate." It was not easy to be rewarded for one's efforts. After he and the county magistrate persuaded one department after another, they finally secured 30 million yuan in funding and issued a document in the name of the State Planning Commission, the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, the Propaganda Department, and the State Port Management Committee. It was not easy! This was the first document issued by the central government to this county since the liberation of the country. With this 30 million yuan special fund, three 1,250-kilowatt hydropower stations will be built on the Pamir Mountains, and the history of the Tajiks living without electricity will soon come to an end. Speaking of this, Yuan Jianmin was more excited and excited than if he had 30 million yuan in his pocket.

The hearts of the Tajiks are as vast as the blue sky of the Pamirs, and their hearts are as pure as the snow peaks of the Pamirs. Can the infatuated Yuan Jianmin not strive and devote himself?

I wish this passionate young man to be as tenacious and resilient as an eagle, soaring in the high Pamirs.

　　多情的帕米尔〔报告文学〕
    凌愉
    袁建民在县人民代表大会上当选为副县长时，不满３０岁。这个叫塔什库尔干的塔吉克族自治县，在遥远的帕米尔雪山上，同苏联、阿富汗、巴基斯坦三国接壤，是我们国家唯一一个连接三国国界的县，从经纬上看，又是我国最西部的一个县。这里山峰高矗，平均海拔高度为４０００米，全县总面积达６．７６万多平方公里。这是一个充满传奇的神秘的地方。
    　　　　鹰的梦想
    新疆以她的辽阔、神奇、美丽，吸引着内地人，也吸引着外国人。特别是内地的一些少男少女，对新疆更是如痴如梦，一往深情。君不见六十年代初，一部《欢乐的天山》新闻纪录片加上一部描绘新疆生产建设兵团浪漫生活的《军垦战歌》纪录片，在上海市放映了一星期，竟使十万之众的上海青年男女别离亲人，别离黄浦江，投身新疆大地的怀抱……
    今天的少男少女们更勤于思考、事事挑剔了，生活的视野更广宽了，但是，他们仍向往着新疆。冲着天山的雪莲，伊犁的草原，喀什的情歌，吐鲁番的葡萄，达板城的姑娘……或者别的一点什么，他们就像与伙伴们一起到迪斯科舞厅去一样，跳上西去的列车，到新疆去，到天山去。
    袁建民就是这么来的。
    这个机灵的少年充满幻想。１５岁时他在江苏泰州市第九中学上高中，写了一首题为《清洁工人》的诗，发表在泰州市的《青年报》上，并获得全市中学生作文一等奖。然后，这首诗又被《新华日报》选载。袁建民成了中学生的佼佼者，成了全校的“新闻人物”。他是班里的学习尖子，似应上大学。但是，爱幻想改变了他的命运。
    １９７５年，他高中毕业了，异想天开要到新疆去。这一年他１６岁。
    １６岁的少年，有着更大胆更浪漫更不知天高地厚的憧憬。他到了新疆，没有被塔里木的沙漠挽留，没有被准噶尔的风雪阻挡，也没有被叶尔羌河畔的酸奶醉倒。他从家乡泰州市出发，坐了一个星期的火车到达乌鲁木齐，又坐了一个星期的汽车到达喀什。然后，迎着弥漫的风雪，攀登上巍巍帕米尔雪山。他骑着一头牦牛，来到塔什库尔干塔吉克族县瓦恰乡安家落户，当了牧民。
    这里是个梦幻的世界。
    冰峰、雪山、荒野。牛粪当燃料，石窑当住房。帕米尔高原是个大山小山高山矮山统统都被冰雪覆盖的世界。慕士塔格山，色勒库尔山，公格尔山。这里的乔戈里峰是世界第二高峰，海拔８６１１米；号称“冰山之父”的慕士塔格峰，海拔７５４６米，冰雪厚度达５０—７０米，冰川覆盖面积达２００平方公里。
    瓦恰乡就在这些雪山冰峰之中。
    袁建民住在一间自己用石头垒起的四边透风的小屋。与他一起的，还有他的一名中学同学卞洪林（这位当年住石头小屋的卞洪林现在担任着县城建局局长）。走出石头小屋，左面是山，右面是山，前面是山，后面还是山，人像被圈进雪山笼子里。这里住着３５４户塔吉克族牧民。塔吉克是个古老、纯朴、热情的民族，骑马来的客人将马鞭交给主人，主人便要留他过夜。主人把来客请进毡房，铺好羊皮褥子请他坐下后，便帮客人脱鞋，然后牵羊入室，请客人过目——这头羊是专门为款待他而宰杀的。
    袁建民不是路过的客人。尽管他从万里之外而来，但他要在这里当个牧民的雄鹰。塔吉克牧民欢迎了他，关注着他。在这个窄长的雪山峡谷里，这是从古至今住下的第一个汉人。何况这位唇上还没有长出胡须的小家伙，不是把马鞭交给牧民要去牧民家喝奶茶、吃羊腿、坐他铺好的羊皮褥子，而是自己用石块石片垒起了一间小屋，住了下来。
    牧民们诧异了一阵，注视了一阵，这石头小屋挡不住凛冽的风雪，却拴住了这年轻汉人的心。他们把马奶和羊腿送进了这间石头小屋，把马匹和羊鞭送到他手里，喊他一起去放牧，去割羊，去拾牛粪，去摔跤，去赛马，去和姑娘们跳那种颇具特色的摔跤舞。
    这里几乎一年四季吃不到白面、大米，吃不到蔬菜、水果，成天是青稞打的馕，砖茶熬的浓浓的茶水，老吃不饱，吃多了就便血。他感到茫茫然。但是，一腔热血只回了一个小小的漩涡，便又澎湃激昂地向前奔流了。骑上马，赶着羊群，走出这窄窄的雪山峡谷，到处是广阔美丽的草原（后来他才知道，这块雪山峡谷周围的山坡上，竟有１５万多亩天然草场）。渐渐地，他与牧民日出而作，日落而归，一身山民打扮，俨然是个塔吉克牧民了。成天同塔吉克人在一起，他又是那样聪明好学，用了短短一年时间，就学会了塔吉克语，用塔吉克语同村里的人交谈。从此，纯朴的牧民在感情上对他有了一个飞跃。从此，他常常坐进牧民的毡房，围着牛粪马粪驴粪燃起的熊熊火光，静静地听塔吉克老人讲述一个一个像山泉般汩汩流动的传说。他骑在转场的牦牛背上，凝神听塔吉克族男女青年令人销魂的情歌。他赶着毛驴到几十里外的山上打柴，去拾牛粪马粪驴粪。望着高原那碧蓝的天，洁白的冰山，翠绿的草滩，潺潺的溪水，飞窜的赤狐，滑翔的雪鸡……他被这一切所倾倒，所陶醉，一个古老民族的精神和风物给他一种文化的陶冶。他吮吸着，思索着，幻想着。他急切地想更多更深地了解这个民族，想把他所知道所感受的一切告诉人们。在这段日子里，他记下了上十万字的日记，他逐渐地真正品尝到了塔吉克人浓奶茶的甜美，酸奶子的醇洌，青稞馕的馨香……塔吉克族人民是纯美多情的，他们也喜欢上了这个汉族小伙子。一天，乡党委副书记木扎尔买买提拍着袁建民的肩膀，问他：“年轻的朋友，你今年多大了？”袁建民说：“再过两个月我就满十八岁了。”木扎尔买买提眯缝着眼睛，望了他一会，对他说：“看得出来，你是爱上了我们帕米尔，爱上了我们塔吉克族了，你不是一个一般的客人。塔吉克是鹰的传人，你是帕米尔的一只小鹰，在雪山上迎着风雪翱翔，你会越飞越高。共产党是塔吉克族人民的救星。你是塔吉克人民的儿子，也应该是党的儿子。”
    不久，袁建民在瓦恰乡成了一名中国共产党党员。这时是１９７６年４月他刚满十八岁。
    他无法平静。
    当毡房里弥漫着马奶和酥油的香甜时，他轻轻地走出石头小屋，在冰山下燃起一堆熊熊的篝火。火光之下，他心绪激荡着。近处是村寨、毡房和一条已经干涸了的古老的河，是星星、月亮以及在月光下闪出亮光的冰山。这闪闪烁烁的火焰，是方圆几百里、几千里之内唯一的光亮。他翘首遥望，想起了他的童年和少年，他的小伙伴，他的亲人，他那慈善的母亲。此时此刻，他们在做些什么呢？他多么眷恋着他们，同时也眷恋着可爱的故乡南方小镇泰州市，那繁华的柏油马路，那马路两旁的霓虹灯。忽然，远处有人吹起了鹰笛，笛声悠扬而高昂，这笛声在诉说着叙述着什么呢？是这里泥土的芬芳吗？是欢乐的牧歌吗？还是帕米尔神奇的历史和这古老纯朴的民族？不。也许是塔吉克对未来的期望吧？篝火燃得更旺了，他掏出他的日记本，想写一篇日记，想写几封给母亲和亲人的信。但是，写在日记上的几个字却是《我爱你，帕米尔！》。这是一篇散文的标题吗？这时，飘逸的笛声来到了他的身后，几个塔吉克青年男女来到他身旁：“朋友，你一个人静静地在这里写什么呢？这么好的篝火，来！我们一起跳舞吧！”
    熊熊的篝火再度欢腾了起来。
    　　　　梦想是可以描绘的
    对于中外客人，帕米尔有着无穷的魅力。
    但是，人们对帕米尔的神奇又知晓多少？
    袁建民在一座冰山下放牧，一位老塔吉克牧人指着远处一座云绕雾罩的冰峰对他说：“在这座冰光瑰丽的雪山顶上，安放着一具牧民少女，已经好几百年了。”
    “是吗？”他惊奇极了。
    “她还完好美丽。”这位老牧人用一种深沉的口吻向他慢慢叙说着。“她有惊人的容貌，她有动听的歌喉，她柔细的皮肤使冰峰上的雪莲显得逊色，她嘹亮的歌声能驱散呼啸的狂风。她因为不屈于牧主的侮辱欺凌，纵身跳到一个深深的冰谷里。不知道过了多少年，一位老牧人发现了她。人们倾慕她的美丽，钦佩她的坚贞，称颂她的勇敢，把她安放在这座高高的冰山顶上，让阳光温暖着她的心房。从此，在阳光灿烂的日子，雪山在阳光下晶莹透亮。人们遥望那高入云霄的冰峰，这时冰峰顶上总有那美丽的云彩遮掩，曾有人看见过云彩像一把彩扇那样打开，那位美丽的牧民少女站在冰峰上，遥望着那连绵的雪山。”
    不久，他写的散文《我爱你，帕米尔》便带着高原这种独有的灵性和激情，走上了１９８０年第三期的《新疆文学》。紧接着，１９８３年，散文《美丽的帕米尔之夜》被《中国导报》世界语版发表，并被翻译介绍到国外。１９８４年，散文《童话般的帕米尔》被《中国少数民族文学丛书》选入，并作为中央民族学院的教材而引起人们的瞩目。这时，袁建民已调入县人民政府办公室任秘书。环境的变化，条件的好转，使他有机会更多更好地了解了帕米尔，了解了塔吉克。他常常下乡，常常回到他难忘的、离县城有８５公里、全县海拔最高的村寨瓦恰乡。他以更大的兴趣，更大的激情，去寻访他没有去过的那些陌生之地。他的塔吉克语越来越熟练。他一身牧民的打扮，提包里除了笔记本，又增加了一个小录音机。他和几位同志要渡过塔什库尔干一条峡谷中的河，这条河有３００多米宽，河水绿得发蓝，蓝得发青，青得发黑，站在险峻的河岸上往下望，令人生畏胆寒。河水是那样的湍急，河面不断卷起一线线、一簇簇雪白耀眼的浪花，翻滚着，咆哮着，奔腾着，不停地向北驰去。河道上下，目力所及，哪有桥梁的影子？只有一处还有几根细细的铁索。那铁索不停地颤动，又像轻飘飘地向着上游不断移去，铁索上下，原来铺设的木板、木棒和树枝之类的东西，有的折断了，有的松脱了，有的倒挂在铁索上，大多数地方则什么也没有，只剩几根黑黝黝的铁索。这些铁索是什么人什么时候架设的，有多久的历史了，都已经无人知道了。
    “我们不能过，要过也得另想办法”几位同志提醒袁建民。
    袁建民这时想起河对岸那个僻远的游牧区，人们说那里早已与世隔绝，他说：“不！到了这里，再没有其它办法了。水那么急，在这帕米尔高原我们用一万两黄金也是找不到一条船的，我先过。”说着，他在自己腰上拴紧一根绳子，把绳子的一头交给同伴：“我万一掉下去，你们拉紧，不要慌忙，我会游泳。”说完，他踏上桥去。有木板的地方，他轻轻挪动脚步；遇到那圆滚圆滚的木棒，他猫着身子移去。到了桥中间，铁索上既无木板又没有树枝，令人心里发颤发悸。袁建民就全身趴下去，双手抓住前面的一条铁索，两脚蹬牢后面的一条铁索，侧着身躯，一寸一寸往前移，他不敢吸一口大气，不敢往下看一眼。３００多米的河宽，他折腾了三个多小时，终于安全到达了对岸。后来，他又多次领着伙伴从这条铁索上来往。
    他的视野越来越宽广了，他采集的素材越来越丰富了，他对帕米尔的每一寸土地也更加深情了。几年时间，３０篇纪实、抒情散文，凝聚着一个南国青年对高原的独特情怀倾泻而出，先后被《人民日报》、《散文》、《新疆青年》等报刊发表采用，他被吸收为喀什地区作协会员，加入了新疆民族文学研究会，逐渐进入对塔吉克整个民族文学的研究和探讨，对塔吉克这个民族的人种、历史、文化、宗教、风俗等进行全面的考证和研究。１９８７年９月１１日他当选为副县长，他当着１０６位人大代表作了几分钟的就职演说，他说：“我是党长期培养，塔吉克人民长期关怀，才有了今天的。我吃了塔吉克族的盐巴和奶茶，我一定要为这个民族的振兴贡献一切力量，还要让更多更多的人了解塔吉克，热爱帕米尔。”
    他是用塔吉克语说这番话的。他的话只说了几分钟，掌声却不止几分钟。
    　　　　真正的描绘在未来
    去年夏天，笔者在喀什与袁建民相遇。他是作为中国地方政府代表团的一个官员，在这里与巴基斯坦政府代表团就红其拉甫山口有关问题进行会谈的。地处帕米尔高原两山夹峙中的红其拉甫山口，意谓“血谷”，是昔日盗贼出没之地，也是战事频繁之地。自从１９８６年我国政府宣布向世界开放以来，短短两年多时间，从这个山口进出境的旅客已达六万多人次，进出境车辆７０００多车次。五大洲的旅游者，商人，外交、登山、探险、朝觐、探亲人员，新闻记者以及贸易商队，从这个被称为中国开放友好的“西大门”口岸来到我国。这次会谈，中巴双方涉及到十分广泛的问题。袁建民提出开辟帕米尔境内的旅游参观游览。他说，五大洲的朋友从红其拉甫山口踏入中国的土地，可以直接下山到维吾尔族的故乡喀什市，可以去龟兹古国库车以及吐鲁番、乌鲁木齐，可以像马可波罗和瑞典探险家赫文斯定一样，到达喀什后再横过塔克拉玛干大沙漠或环绕塔里木盆地。但是，神奇的帕米尔以及古老的塔吉克族也有着无穷的魅力。说到这里，他列举了帕米尔雪山上的石头古城、公主堡、杏花村、喀喇库里湖、塔合曼温泉，以及矗立在高高冰山上的将军洞和彩石山。他对客人们说：“我们塔什库尔干县最近购进了十辆装有空调设备和音响设备的豪华面包车，以接待巴基斯坦的朋友以及五大洲的朋友。”这位年轻潇洒的副县长的发言，引起了巴基斯坦政府代表团团长、北部地区行政长官阿布都·克尤木·汗的极大兴趣。他说：“袁先生的发言应该让更多的人知道。我去过塔合曼温泉，它太神奇了，它在慕士塔格峰冰山深处，海拔３２００米，夏天的气温是零下３０度，而这个温泉，却沸腾着，冒着扑扑的热气，有摄氏８０度，我丢进一个鸡蛋，一会儿就煮熟了。据说这个冰山温泉的水中含有２３种元素，可以治疗好几种疾病。还有塔吉克人用一根鹰的骨头竟然能够掏空制成一支鹰笛，吹出那么悠美动听的曲子，真是不可思议。”阿布都·克尤木·汗团长当然不会想到这位年轻的中国政府官员，２０多岁已经担任塔什库尔干县的外事办公室主任了。但是，阿布都·克尤木·汗从这位年轻官员的发言神情中，却看到了一位汉族人对帕米尔对塔吉克的一往深情。
    白天，袁建民在地上铺着和田地毯墙上也挂着和田壁毯的会议室与代表团会谈，陪他们参观香妃墓和艾提尕广场清真寺。晚上，与我们一墙之隔的宾馆舞厅乐曲悠悠，我敲开袁建民的住房，他正在伏案写东西。八开大白纸，厚厚一叠，有几万字，题目就是：鹰的传人——塔吉克风情帕米尔风光展。
    这个展览近期将在首都开幕。整个展览的计划和说明，由他和北京自然博物馆的周国兴共同撰写。上千个条目，上千件实物和图表，上下数千年，纵横数千里。他修改过无数次，还在琢磨，还在修改。“这是个浩大的工程，是帕米尔历史上的第一次。”
    当我们的话题谈到这次展览时，袁建民感慨万千。他说，今年元月，他和县长阿布扎尔·黑力力到北京为修建水电站找中央有关部门。这件事他们努力了十年，县上的报告打到专区，专区转到自治区，自治区转到中央。在中央一些业务部门工作的某些人，竟对这个县这个民族这个帕米尔地区一无所知。袁建民说：“你们没有听说过的地方，我们争取了十一年，跑了十一年！”然后指着阿布扎尔·黑力力说：“他是县长，是第六届、第七届人大代表，我是副县长。”也算是功夫不负有心人。经过他和县长一个部门一个部门的游说，终于争取到了３０００万元的拨款，并且以国家计委、中央民委、中宣部、国家口岸管理委员会的名义，联合下达了文件。不容易啊！这是全国解放以来由中央下达给这个县的第一个文件。用这３０００万元专款，将在帕米尔雪山修建三座１２５０千瓦的水电站，塔吉克人无电的历史很快将告结束。说到这里，袁建民显得比他自己口袋里装进了３０００万巨款还要激动和兴奋。
    塔吉克人的胸怀，像帕米尔的蓝天一样坦荡，塔吉克人的心地，像帕米尔的雪峰一样纯洁。痴情的袁建民，能不努力能不鞠躬尽瘁吗？
    祝愿这位热血青年，像鹰一般的刚毅，像鹰一般的顽强，在高高的帕米尔展翅翱翔。
    袁建民属于多情的帕米尔！
