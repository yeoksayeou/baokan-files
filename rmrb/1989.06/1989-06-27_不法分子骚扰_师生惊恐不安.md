    Criminals Harass Teachers and Students, Causing Fear and Anxiety
    At around 4 PM on April 13, two villagers from Caocun in Ziyuan Township, Zhang Quanmin and Huang Wenku, rode their bicycles into the school, disrupting the students who were having their physical education class. They snatched a basketball from the students and threw it around, shattering the classroom windows. Later, they freely entered and exited the classrooms, making strange noises around the classrooms, and even punched a seventh-grade student, Liu Guofeng, causing his nose to bleed.

    Subsequently, Zhang Quanmin and Huang Wenku intruded into the school office, lying on the teachers' beds to rest. When teachers Zhang Zhigang and Jiao Yutian tried to persuade them to leave, Zhang Quanmin and Huang Wenku started a fight, using bricks to injure teacher Zhang Zhigang. Teacher Zhang Deming came to mediate, but was slapped in the face by Zhang Quanmin. Zhang Quanmin and Huang Wenku continued to disrupt the school for over two hours, severely disrupting the normal teaching order. Teachers and students were in fear and anxiety. The school was forced to suspend classes for two consecutive days the next day and the day after.

    We appeal to the relevant departments to seriously handle these two criminals.

　　不法分子骚扰师生惊恐不安
    ４月１３日下午４时许，我市紫岩乡曹村村民张全民、黄文奎两人骑车闯入学校，冲散正在上体育课的学生队伍，抢走学生的篮球乱投乱砸，砸碎教室的玻璃。后来，他俩随便进出教室，在教室周围怪叫，还将七年级学生刘国锋鼻子打出血。
    此后，张全民、黄文奎又闯入学校办公室，躺在教师床上休息。教师张志刚、焦遗田劝他们离开，张全民、黄文奎便大打出手，用砖块把张志刚老师打伤。教师张德明前来劝解，被张全民打了一记耳光。张全民、黄文奎在学校骚扰滋事持续了两个多小时，破坏了学校正常的教学秩序，教师、学生惊恐不安。第二天、第三天学校连续两天停课。
    呼吁有关部门严肃处理这两名不法分子。
