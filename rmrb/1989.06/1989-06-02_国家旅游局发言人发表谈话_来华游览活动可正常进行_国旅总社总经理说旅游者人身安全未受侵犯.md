Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 2nd.

The spokesperson for the National Tourism Administration today issued a statement saying that the personal safety of overseas tourists visiting China is currently guaranteed, and sightseeing activities can proceed normally. This does not affect travel agencies organizing tours to China.

The spokesperson said that in the first quarter of this year, the number of foreigners visiting China increased by 10.7% compared to the same period last year. The number of compatriots returning to visit relatives also saw a significant increase compared to the same period last year. However, since mid-April, some countries' governments and travel agencies have expressed concerns about safety and have advised their citizens to postpone their trips to China. We can understand this. But the actual situation is that for those who came to China to tour in April and May, China's travel agencies, hotels, and relevant departments have provided normal reception and organized sightseeing and visits. After the Chinese government decided on May 20 to impose martial law in certain areas of Beijing, except for a few attractions like the Forbidden City that are temporarily closed, it does not affect normal sightseeing.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 2nd. (Reporter Chen Yun) Wang Erkang, Chairman of the China International Travel Service Corporation and General Manager of the China International Travel Service, said today that from April 15th to the present, the personal safety of tourists visiting China has not been infringed upon in any way, nor have they encountered any impolite or unpleasant situations. Their travel plans have proceeded basically as planned. During this period, China International Travel Service has not received a single complaint letter.

Wang Erkang said that most of the foreign tourists who have come to China during this time have reflected that they have had a very pleasant experience. An American Harris Travel Services tour leader, Sullivan, recently told a foreign reporter in Beijing: "There are no obstacles to traveling in China now." However, Wang Erkang said, many foreign tourists regret not being able to visit the Forbidden City.

Wang Erkang also said that due to foreign tourists not understanding the true situation in China, some countries' governments and travel agencies have advised their citizens to postpone their trips to China. Recently, there have indeed been some cases of foreign tour groups canceling their trips.

　　国家旅游局发言人发表谈话
    来华游览活动可正常进行
    国旅总社总经理说旅游者人身安全未受侵犯
    本报北京６月２日讯  国家旅游局发言人今天发表谈话说，目前海外来华旅游者人身安全有保障，参观游览活动可以正常进行，不影响旅行社组织旅游者来华。
    这位发言人说，今年１季度来华旅游的外国人比去年同期增长１０．７％，回来探亲的同胞比去年同期也有大幅度增长。但是，４月中旬以来，有的国家政府和旅行社担心安全得不到保障，劝告本国公民推迟来华旅游，对此我们可以理解。但实际情况是，对４、５月份来华旅游的人，中国的旅行社、饭店等有关部门都正常进行接待，组织游览参观。中国政府５月２０日决定北京市部分地区实行戒严后，除北京故宫等少数参观点暂停开放外，也不影响正常游览。
    据新华社北京６月２日电　（记者陈芸）中国国际旅行社集团董事长、中国国际旅行社总社总经理王尔康今天在此间对记者说，从４月１５日至今，来华旅游者的人身安全没有受到任何侵犯，也没有受到不礼貌或不愉快的遭遇，他们的旅游计划基本正常进行。在此期间，中国国际旅行社没有收到一封投诉信。
    王尔康说，这段时间来中国的外国旅游者大多反映过得很愉快。正在中国旅游的美国哈里斯旅行社领队苏林日前在北京对一位外国记者说：“现在来中国旅游没什么妨碍。”但是，王尔康说，不少外国游客对不能参观故宫感到遗憾。
    王尔康还说，由于外国游客不了解中国真实的情况，一些国家政府和旅行社劝告本国公民推迟来华旅游，最近确实出现了一些外国旅游团退团的情况。
