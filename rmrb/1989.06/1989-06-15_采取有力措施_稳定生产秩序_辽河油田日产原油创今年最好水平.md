The 100,000 employees of the Liaohoe Oilfield have focused their efforts on improving crude oil production. In May, the daily crude oil production reached 35,000 tons, an increase of 700 tons compared to April, setting a new record for the year.

Since June, the Liaohoe Oilfield has called on all employees to further stabilize production order and increase crude oil production. The Shenyang Oil Extraction Plant has set a goal of producing 8,000 tons of crude oil per day in June. To achieve this target, the plant's party and government leaders have each taken on a specific task, and all cadre members at the level of team leader and above have specific measures to ensure success. Currently, the goal of producing 8,000 tons per day has been achieved. The 105th Work Team of the Dawn Oil Extraction Operation, which won the national petroleum system gold medal in 1988, has completed this year's production task 223 days ahead of schedule. The Drilling Company 2 has completed drilling 41 wells, with wellbody quality and cementing quality both reaching 100%.

　　采取有力措施　稳定生产秩序
    辽河油田日产原油创今年最好水平
    新华社沈阳６月１５日电  辽河油田１０万职工集中精力搞好原油生产，５月份日产原油３５０００吨，比４月份净增７００吨，创今年以来的最好水平。
    进入６月份以来，辽河油田要求全体职工进一步稳定生产秩序，增加原油生产。沈阳采油厂提出：６月份大干３０天，日产原油８０００吨。为了实现这个目标，厂党政领导成员每人承包一项任务，班组长以上干部人人都有具体保证措施。现在，日产８０００吨的目标已经达到。１９８８年获得全国石油系统金牌队称号的曙采作业１０５队，已提前２２３天完成今年生产任务。钻井２公司已完成钻井４１口，井身质量和固井质量都达到１００％。
