Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, June 1st.

	In recent years, Zhouzhi County has been plagued by internal strife from the county leadership downwards. During county people's congresses and party congresses, rumors have been spread, and character assassinations have been rampant through various posters, open letters, and leaflets. The practice of canvassing for votes and making promises has become widespread both during and outside of meetings.

	This internal strife has extended to various departments, bureaus, and townships, where factions have formed by aligning with higher-ups and rallying supporters below. Due to the continuous internal strife from top to bottom, the county's economic development has been sluggish. Many officials are reluctant to work in Zhouzhi County, fearing they will get stuck in this quagmire.

	In March of this year, the Xi'an Municipal Party Committee dispatched a work group led by a deputy secretary to Zhouzhi County. The group investigated the internal strife issues and made significant adjustments to the county's Party Committee and government leadership. It was decided to transfer the county's Party secretary and deputy secretary to other counties, and to remove the original Party Committee member and head of the Organization Department from their posts, as well as the original deputy county mayor. The Municipal Party Committee appointed two officials to serve as the Party secretary and deputy secretary (also head of the Organization Department) of Zhouzhi County, and recommended that an original deputy Party secretary be appointed as the deputy county mayor.

　　周至上下连年“窝里斗”
    西安市委采取果断措施予以解决
    新华社西安６月１日电  （记者杨延礼、王向坤）中共西安市委采取果断措施，解决周至县“窝里斗”问题。
    近年来，周至县从县一级领导机关起就一摊一伙地搞“窝里斗”。在县人代会、党代会上，传播各种谣言，进行人身攻击的大小字报、公开信、传单满天飞，会上会下拉票许愿的歪风盛行。
    县上斗，一些部局委办和乡镇也上找靠山、下拉队伍。由于上上下下不断“窝里斗”，这个县经济发展缓慢，许多干部都不愿在周至县工作，怕陷进这泥潭里拔不出来。
    今年３月，中共西安市委派出了以市委副书记为首的帮助工作组，进驻周至县，查处这个县“窝里斗”问题，并对县委、县政府的领导班子作了较大调整，决定将县委书记、常务副书记调其他县工作，原县委常委、组织部长免职，原常务副县长免职。市委另调两位同志任周至县县委书记、副书记兼组织部长，建议另一位原任县委副书记任常务副县长。
