A newly completed Long March Memorial stands tall and proud on the majestic Yuanbao Mountain in Songpan County, northern Sichuan.

The memorial is 44.8 meters high in total, with a 14.8-meter-tall bronze statue of a Red Army soldier weighing over 10 tons.

The decision to build this Long March Memorial was made by the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission. The construction task was undertaken by a certain engineering regiment of the People's Liberation Army, which formed a construction team. They overcame numerous difficulties such as high-altitude hypoxia and hazardous construction conditions, working day and night through wind and snow. They successfully completed the construction of the Long March Memorial ahead of schedule by three months, ensuring both quality and quantity.

　　松潘新落成
    长征纪念碑
    本报讯  一座新近落成的红军长征纪念碑矗立在川北松潘县巍峨挺拔的元宝山上。
    这座纪念碑总高四十四点八米，其中红军战士铜像高十四点八米，重十余吨。
    修建这座红军长征纪念碑是党中央、中央军委作出的决定。担任建设任务的解放军某工兵团为基础，组成了一支施工部队。他们克服高原缺氧、施工艰险等重重困难，顶风冒雪，昼夜施工，终于保质保量完成了红军长征碑的修建任务，比原计划提前了三个月。
