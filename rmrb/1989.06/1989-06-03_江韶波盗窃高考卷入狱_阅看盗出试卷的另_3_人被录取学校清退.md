Jiang Shaobo Imprisoned for Stealing College Entrance Exam Papers
Three Others Who Viewed the Stolen Papers Expelled from Their Admitting Schools

BEIJING, June 3 (Xinhua) -- On May 20, Jiang Shaobo, a 1988 graduate from a high school in Quanjiaoh River Town, Yiyang County, Hunan Province, was sentenced to one year in prison by the Yiyang County People's Court for stealing and leaking college entrance exam papers.

Jiang, 19, lives near the Hunan Provincial Education Commission's designated printing site for college entrance exam papers, the Quanjiaoh River Art Printing Factory. On the morning of June 30 last year, Jiang, who had gone for an early morning run, noticed that the window of the warehouse storing the exam papers was open. Seizing the opportunity, he fetched a ladder from his home, climbed into the warehouse, and took 20 exam papers and a reference answer book, hiding them in his pockets and bringing them home.

Before the exam, Jiang Shaobo showed the stolen papers to four of his classmates participating in the college entrance exam on four separate occasions. Jiang and the four others were subsequently admitted to East China Normal University, Hunan Finance and Economics University, Hunan Medical University, Hunan Normal University, and Yiyang Normal College, respectively. Afterward, they formed a pact to destroy evidence and try to cover up their actions.

After the college entrance exam, some students in Yiyang County discussed the unusual circumstances, and someone reported it to the provincial admissions office. Based on the information provided in the letter, the Hunan Provincial Education Commission organized a joint investigation team from the provincial, municipal, and county levels on August 13 last year to conduct an investigation. With the cooperation of relevant departments, the truth about Jiang Shaobo's theft and leakage of the college entrance exam papers was finally revealed.

It is understood that the other three individuals who viewed the stolen papers from Jiang Shaobo have been expelled from their admitting schools, while the fourth person, due to his relatively good attitude, was allowed to continue his studies.

    江韶波盗窃高考卷入狱
    阅看盗出试卷的另3人被录取学校清退
    本报长沙6月3日电　5月20日，湖南省益阳县泉交河镇1988届高中毕业生江韶波因盗窃、泄露高考试卷，被益阳县人民法院判处有期徒刑1年。
    今年19岁的江韶波家住湖南省教委指定的高考试卷印刷点——泉交河美术印刷厂附近。去年6月30日清晨，江犯早起跑步路过印刷厂时发现，存放试卷的厂房窗户未关，顿起盗窃试卷邪念。他跑回家搬来楼梯，越窗入室，选了20张试卷和一本高考参考答案等绝密资料装入口袋，带回家中。
    临考前，江韶波先后4次将试卷给参加高考的4名同学传阅。江韶波等5人分别被华东师范大学、湖南财经学院、湖南医科大学、湖南师范大学和益阳师范专科学校录取。此后，他们订立攻守同盟，销毁证据，企图蒙混过关。
    高考结束后，益阳县部分考生对上述异常现象议论纷纷，有人向省招生办作了反映。对此，湖南省教委根据来信反映的情况，于去年8月13日组织省、地、县联合调查组进行调查。在有关部门的配合下，江韶波盗窃和泄露高考试卷一案终于真相大白。
    据了解，从江韶波那里阅看了盗出试卷的其他4人，其中3人已被录取的学校清退出校，另1人因态度较好被留校继续就读。 　（吴兴华　张湘成　陶清新）
