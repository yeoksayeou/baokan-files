The Soviet Union will investigate the Soviet-German Pact and its secret protocols.

The Soviet Congress of People's Deputies agreed today to establish a special committee to investigate the 1939 Soviet-German Pact and its "secret protocols" to provide a political and legal assessment. The agreement was reached without a vote and was unanimous.

It is well known that this pact was signed between Stalin's Soviet Union and Hitler's Germany on the eve of World War II. It involved the sovereignty of Poland and the three Baltic states—Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania. This pact is considered a "blank spot" in Soviet history and in Soviet-Polish relations.

The proposal was made by representatives from the three Baltic republics.

During the discussion of this proposal, Soviet leader Gorbachev said that neither the Soviet archives nor the archives of the Federal Republic of Germany have found the original "secret protocols" to date. Currently, only a copy is available, and on this copy, the then Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, for unknown reasons, signed in German.

He revealed that during German Chancellor Kohl's visit to the Soviet Union last year, Gorbachev had asked him if the Federal Republic of Germany had the original of this pact. Kohl gave an affirmative answer. However, when the Soviet Foreign Ministry sent people to Germany to examine it, they did not find such a document.

　　苏将调查苏德条约及其秘密议定书
    新华社莫斯科６月１日电  苏联人代会今天上午未经表决，一致同意建立一个专门委员会，对１９３９年签订的苏德条约及其“秘密议定书”进行调查，以便作出政治和法律评价。
    众所周知，这项条约是斯大林领导的苏联同希特勒德国在二次大战前夕签订的，它涉及波兰和波罗的海３个独立国家——爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚和立陶宛的主权。这项条约被称为苏联历史上和苏波关系史上的“空白点”。
    上述提案是波罗的海３个加盟共和国的代表提出的。
    在讨论这项提案时，苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫说，无论在苏联的档案中，还是在联邦德国的档案中，迄今尚未找到“秘密议定书”的真本，目前只见到其抄本，而在这个抄本上，当时的苏联外长莫洛托夫不知为什么是用德文签的字。
    他透露，去年联邦德国总理科尔访苏时，戈尔巴乔夫曾问他，联邦德国有无这项条约的真本，科尔给了肯定的回答。但苏联外交部派人去联邦德国查阅时，却未发现有这样的文件。
