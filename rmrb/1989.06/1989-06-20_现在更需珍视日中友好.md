Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, June 19th

Now more than ever, we must cherish Sino-Japanese friendship. This was the sentiment expressed by Koto performer Koda Koto from Hokkaido's Hakodate City, which resonated deeply with the audience present.

Since June 4th, a cloud of bewilderment has hung over the hearts of many Japanese friends. Exchanges between China and Japan, as well as joint activities, have significantly decreased. Amid this unusual atmosphere, on June 12th, the "Sino-Japanese Friendship Koto Concert" was held as scheduled in Hakodate City, Hokkaido. Many people were anxious about whether this concert would be successful.

However, this concert, which was entirely organized by local enthusiasts, achieved unexpected success. It was performed three times, each time to a full house, with thunderous applause. Mr. Akioka, who traveled from Tokyo, remarked with deep emotion, "For a small-scale local concert like this to attract so many listeners and receive such enthusiastic support, it shows that Sino-Japanese friendship is the will of the people and the heart of the people."

　　现在更需珍视日中友好
    本报记者  于青
    “中国近来不平静，但我们希望日中友好的心没有变，我愿为此助一臂之力，现在更需珍视日中友好。”日本北海道函馆市的木琴演奏家小田光子的这番话在与会观众中引起强烈的共鸣。
    ６月４日以来，一层困惑的阴云笼罩在许多日本友好人士的心头。中日之间的人员往来和共同举办的活动骤减。在这种异常气氛中，６月１２日，“日中友好木琴演奏会”在北海道函馆市如期举行。不少人对这次演奏会是否取得成功捏着一把汗。
    但是，这次完全由当地人自发组织的演奏会却取得了意想不到的成功，连演三场，场场爆满，掌声雷动。从东京赶来的秋冈先生深有感慨地说：“这种地方型的小型演奏会现在能有这么多听众，给予如此热情的支持，由此可见日中友好是民心所在，人心所向。”
