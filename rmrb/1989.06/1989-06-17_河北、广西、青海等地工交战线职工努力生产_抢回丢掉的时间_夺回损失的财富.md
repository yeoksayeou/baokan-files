Workers on the industrial and transportation fronts in Hebei, Guangxi, Qinghai, and other regions are striving to produce, recover lost time, and regain lost wealth.

Newspaper reporters from Hebei, Guangxi, Qinghai, and other regions sent reports saying that workers in these places are displaying a strong sense of responsibility, working diligently to make up for economic losses.

In Hebei Province, workers on the industrial and transportation fronts have been steadfast in their positions, working hard to produce. In the first ten days of June, industrial output reached a historical high for the same period. After the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing on June 3, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee and government urged all regions and cities to focus on economic work, stabilize the situation, and called on workers to overcome difficulties and make contributions, aligning their actions with the Party Central Committee. Various regions and cities adopted measures to solve the problems of raw material supply and product output, ensuring the balanced production of enterprises. In Shijiazhuang, industrial production continued to rise steadily in the first ten days of June, building on the historical high achieved in May. The 130,000 workers at the Kailuan Coal Mine, through labor competitions and high-yield activities, achieved daily overproduction in May, and in the first ten days of June, they produced an additional 1,094 tons of coal beyond the plan. The Tangshan Power Plant has been operating safely for 135 consecutive days, ensuring the production and living electricity needs of the Beijing, Tianjin, and Tangshan regions.

In the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, 1.07 million workers of various ethnic groups overcame difficulties such as insufficient raw materials, transportation, energy, and funds, achieving steady industrial development. From January to May this year, the total industrial output value of the region increased by 9% compared to the same period last year. Workers cherish the stable and united situation, striving to increase production and support national construction. By the end of May, 26 out of 40 major industrial products in the region had increased compared to the same period last year, with sugar, automobiles, and pesticides already completing their annual production plans ahead of schedule.

In Qinghai Province, 700,000 workers are determined to contribute to the stability of the situation through industrial production, improving economic benefits, and ensuring the effective supply of people's livelihoods. In the first five months of this year, the province's industrial production increased by 6.7%.

In Harbin, workers quickly took action, determined to make up for lost time and regain lost wealth with all their might. The Harbin municipal government, through strengthened coordination and service, actively created conditions for enterprises to produce. Currently, 32 production service teams, composed of leading cadres from provincial and municipal departments, have entered some large and medium-sized enterprises to help solve problems related to raw materials, electricity, funds, and transportation.

In Taiyuan, workers in the industrial and transportation systems remained focused and energetic when some people attempted to create chaos, working diligently to ensure production. In May, the city's total industrial output value exceeded the plan by 11.7%, with the largest increases in coal, electricity, building materials, and light industrial products, which are closely related to national economic construction and people's lives. To ensure that production is not disrupted, various enterprises in the city organized factory and mine protection teams. The 80,000 workers at Taiyuan Steel voluntarily observed discipline, with no production stoppages, completing the steel production plan by 10% in May. The West Mountain Mining Bureau's raw coal and coke production and safety production reached historical highs this month; the Taiyuan Heavy Machinery Factory, which is responsible for manufacturing large-scale equipment for national key construction projects, also completed its production tasks by 14.6% ahead of schedule. By the first ten days of June, the city's 26 key enterprises produced 18.8% more than the same period last month.
