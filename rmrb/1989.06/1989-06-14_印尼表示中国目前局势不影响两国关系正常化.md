Xinhua News Agency, Singapore, June 14th.

According to a report by Indonesia's *Jakarta Post* yesterday, Indonesian State Minister Mochtar Kusumaatmadja said on the 12th that the recent situation in China will not affect the process of normalizing diplomatic relations between Indonesia and China.

He made these remarks while accompanying Indonesian President Suharto on his return flight from a visit to the United States to Jakarta, in response to questions from the newspaper's reporter.

He said that no matter what happens inside China, it will not change China's promise not to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs.

He said that the normalization of relations between China and Indonesia should be based on the Ten Principles of the Bandung Conference and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, including mutual respect for each other's territorial integrity, non-aggression against each other's interests, and non-interference in each other's internal affairs.

The report also stated that Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas recently said that the permanent missions of Indonesia and China to the United Nations have held the first round of talks on some technical issues related to the normalization of bilateral relations, and another round of talks is also about to begin.

Alatas said that the foreign ministers of the two countries will hold talks during the United Nations General Assembly in September.

　　印尼表示中国目前局势
    不影响两国关系正常化
    新华社新加坡６月１４日电  据印尼《雅加达邮报》昨天报道，印尼国务部长穆迪约诺１２日说，中国最近的形势不会影响印尼和中国外交关系正常化的进程。
    他是在陪同印尼总统苏哈托结束访问美国，返回雅加达的飞机上回答该报记者提问时说这番话的。
    他说，无论中国国内发生什么事情，都不会改变中国不干预印尼内部事务的诺言。
    他说，中国与印尼关系正常化应建立在万隆会议１０项原则和和平共处５项原则的基础上，其中包括互相尊重对方的领土完整、互不侵犯彼此的利益和互不干涉对方的内部事务。
    该报还报道说，印尼外长阿拉塔斯最近说，印尼和中国的驻联合国机构已经就两国关系正常化的一些技术性问题进行了第一轮会谈，另一轮会谈也即将开始。
    阿拉塔斯说，两国外长今年９月在出席联合国大会期间将举行会谈。
