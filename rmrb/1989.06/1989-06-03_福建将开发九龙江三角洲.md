Currently, the inflow of Taiwanese investment to southern Fujian is accelerating. As Taiwanese investors in Xiamen approach saturation, they will inevitably shift towards Longhai, located on the southern shore of Xiamen Port. To seize this opportunity, in March and April of this year, relevant leaders from Fujian Province, Zhangzhou City, and Longhai County conducted two discussions in Longhai County regarding the development of the Sanlong River Delta. They also jointly established a strategic development research group. Recently, this group proposed the idea of establishing the "Sanlong River Delta Economic Open Area," which has been affirmed by the provincial government.

According to a report by the *China Urban and Rural Development News*, the basic outline of this open area is: using the coastal regions of Hengtou in the southeastern part of Longhai and the Jiao Mei region in the northeastern part, which borders Xiamen's Haicang suburban district, as the corners, and using the western part of Zhangzhou City as a support, to form a triangular economic region with the coast of the Sanlong River estuary as the main line.

    福建将开发九龙江三角洲
    本报讯　目前，台资向闽南转移呈加速态势，随着台商在厦门投资趋于饱和，势必向位于厦门港南岸的龙海转移。为了抓住这一机遇，今年3、4月，福建省、漳州市、龙海县有关领导先后两次在龙海县探讨了九龙江三角洲开发问题，并联合成立了发展战略研讨小组。最近，这个小组提出了建立“九龙江三角洲经济开放区”的构想，并得到省政府的肯定。
    据《中国城乡开发报》报道，这个开放区的基本轮廓是：以龙海东南部的港尾沿海地区和东北部与厦门海沧郊区接壤的角美地区为犄角，以西部的漳州市区为依托，形成一个以九龙江口沿岸为主线的三角形经济区域。
