Joint ventures with foreign capital in the Soviet Union are developing rapidly, with approximately 10 new ventures established daily. According to a report by TASS today, the number of joint ventures registered with the Soviet Finance Ministry has reached 650, and it is expected that by the end of this year, this number will increase to 1,500.

At the end of last year, the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union issued a special resolution to remove various restrictions imposed by the "Joint Venture Law" of 1987 and to greatly simplify the procedures for establishing such ventures. Since then, the development of joint ventures in the Soviet Union has accelerated significantly.

According to TASS, the existing joint ventures cover various sectors of the Soviet national economy, including industry, agriculture, construction, commerce, and transportation.

　　苏联合资企业发展迅速     
    预计年底可增至１５００家
    新华社莫斯科６月２６日电  外商在苏联境内兴建合资企业正以每天增加约１０家的速度发展，据塔斯社今天报道，在苏联财政部登记注册的合资企业已达６５０家，预计到今年年底可望增至１５００家。
    去年年底苏联部长会议曾专门通过一项决议，取消了１９８７年颁布的《合资企业法》中所作的种种限制，并大大简化了其组建手续，此后苏联合资企业的发展速度明显加快。
    据塔斯社报道，现有的这些合资企业遍布苏联国民经济的各个领域——工业、农业、建筑业、商业和运输业等。
