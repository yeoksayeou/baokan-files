Recently, Chongqing Mayor Sun Tongchuan and Vice Mayor Liu Zhizhong, at a meeting attended by nearly 50 foreign-invested enterprises and relevant department heads, severely criticized some departments and leaders for not considering the big picture, and not actively and proactively helping to solve the specific problems and difficulties faced by foreign-invested enterprises. They pointed out that these behaviors are actually manifestations of not supporting reform and opening up and should be immediately corrected.

At this meeting, managers of foreign-invested enterprises reported on the good cooperation between Chinese and foreign partners, but several foreign-invested enterprises also reflected that they had encountered some seemingly small but actually important specific difficulties and problems, some of which were mainly caused by human factors. The Chinese manager of a joint venture with Britain's GlaxoSmithKline Pharmaceuticals reported that the water and electricity supply problems of their joint venture have not been resolved. The leader of Chongqing Yuxingtong Garment Company, a joint venture with a Hong Kong businessman, reported that this company encountered a labor dispute in March, and although the mayor and vice mayor had made clear instructions, it has not been fully resolved to this day. Some foreign-invested enterprises also reflected that some department heads have obstructed cooperation.

After hearing these situations, Mayor Sun Tongchuan said to the relevant department heads present, "The central government has repeatedly stated that the line and policies since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee will not change, and the policy of reform and opening up must be adhered to. Why is it necessary to emphasize this repeatedly? One important reason is that there are still people in the country who do not actually implement this line and policy." Sun Tongchuan hoped that the leaders of various departments would consider the big picture of reform and opening up, and contribute to reform and opening up. Vice Mayor Liu Zhizhong demanded at the meeting that the relevant departments immediately solve the specific difficulties reflected by foreign-invested enterprises and provide better services for their development.

　　重庆市长听取外资企业汇报时强调
    顾全改革开放大局
    帮助外企解决困难
    新华社重庆６月１８日电  （记者向虎）日前，重庆市长孙同川、副市长刘志忠，在有近５０家外资企业及有关部门负责人参加的会上，严厉批评了一些部门及领导不顾全大局，不积极主动帮助解决外资企业的具体问题和困难的现象。指出，这些行为实际上是不支持改革、开放的表现，应予立即纠正。
    在此间举行的这次会议上，外资企业经理们报告了中外双方良好合作的情况，也有几家外资企业反映，他们遇到了一些说起来很小，但确实很重要的具体困难和问题，有的主要是人为因素造成的。与英国葛兰素制药公司合资的企业中方经理反映，他们合资企业的水、电供应问题一直没有得到解决；与港商合资的重庆裕兴通服装公司领导反映，这家公司今年３月在招聘中遇到了劳务纠纷事件，市长、副市长等虽都作了明确的批示，可至今仍没圆满解决；还有些外资企业反映，有个别部门的负责人在合作中还从中作梗。
    孙同川市长在听了这些情况后对在座的有关方面负责人说，中央一再表示，党的十一届三中全会以来的路线方针不变，改革开放的政策必须坚持。为什么要多次强调？其中一个重要原因就是因为在国内还有人实际上不贯彻、不执行这一方针。孙同川希望各部门领导要顾全改革开放大局，为改革开放献计出力。刘志忠副市长在会上要求有关部门立即解决外资企业反映的具体困难，为其发展提供更好的服务。
