Soviets love to create political jokes, while Chinese people are good at composing rhymes, either indirectly or directly expressing the voices, wishes, and demands of the people. A few lines of rhyme often serve as a thermometer for public sentiment, a touchstone for policy success or failure, and an alarm for social changes. Sometimes, it can reflect public opinion and represent the will of the people more accurately than public opinion polls or referendums in Europe and America.

The author often interacts with farmers and has collected many rhymes with a strong earthy flavor. "First, become a small trader, second, go to the countryside to set up a business, third, go to the construction site, and no one wants to do farm work" is a rhyme that is very popular in rural areas now. With the flourishing development of socialist commodity economy in rural areas, more and more Chinese farmers have ended the history of "facing the yellow earth and turning their backs to the sky, generation after generation without leaving the fields" that has lasted for thousands of years, and have engaged in the secondary and tertiary industries. This is, of course, a cause for celebration. However, after participating in a special investigation of rural conditions, the author suddenly felt worried. There is such a township: the number of young farmers with junior high school education or above engaged in agricultural production accounted for 33% of the township's agricultural labor force in 1984, but this number dropped to less than 5% in 1988. Those who work with the land are mostly illiterate, elderly, and physically declining "bearded soldiers" and "women's army," to the extent that more than 10 villages cannot find successors for the village party secretary or village head, or candidates for the league branch secretary, and there is no one to take on the role of agricultural technician. As for the promotion of new technologies for scientific farming, it is even more difficult. The situation in this township is not an isolated case.

Agriculture has always been considered the foundation of our country, and the warning "no agriculture, no stability" is often seen on the front pages of newspapers. To stabilize and develop agriculture and consolidate the foundation of the country, what do we rely on? Fertilizers, pesticides, diesel, tractors, and also the quality of laborers. In recent years, agricultural production tools have been primitive, methods outdated, investment insufficient, soil fertility has declined sharply, and even large areas of land have been abandoned, leading to stagnant grain production and hidden dangers, which have attracted widespread attention from all sectors of society. While people are increasingly alarmed by the rapid rise in prices of agricultural supplies and the low price of grain hurting farmers, they have intentionally or unintentionally overlooked the most dangerous reality: the rapid and excessive transfer of rural youth, the loss of agricultural talent, and the deteriorating structure and quality of the labor force.

The phenomenon of rural youth eagerly leaving the land has formed a "rush to leave the land and the countryside," which is a hot topic among rural youth today.

### 从一则顺口溜谈起

　　从一则顺口溜谈起
    姚永明
    苏联人爱编政治笑话，而中国人则善于创作顺口溜，或曲折或直接地表达人民群众的呼声、愿望和要求。三言两语的顺口溜，往往是群众情绪的温度计，政策成败的试金石，社会风云的报警器。有时候，它比欧美的民意测验、公民投票更能够反映舆情，代表民意。
    笔者经常同农民打交道，搜集了许多带着泥土气息的顺口溜。“一做小商贩，二进乡村办，三上建筑站，地里的活儿没人干。”就是时下农村里十分流行的顺口溜。随着农村社会主义商品经济的蓬勃发展，越来越多的中国农民结束了千百年来“面向黄土背朝天，世世代代不离田”的历史，去从事第二产业、第三产业，这当然令人高兴。然而，当笔者参与一项农村情况专题调查之后，却陡生杞人之忧。有这样一个乡：从事农业生产的具有初中以上文化水平的青年农民，１９８４年占全乡农业劳力３３％，１９８８年下降到５％以下，同土地打交道的几乎都是些识字无多、年龄老化、体格退化的“胡子兵”和“娘子军”，以至有１０多个村寻不出支书、村长“接班人”，觅不到团支书的候选人，农技员无人胜任。至于科学种田的新技术，更是难以推广。这个乡的情况绝非个别现象。
    农业一向被认为是我国的国本，“无农不稳”的警语时见刊首报端。稳定农业，发展农业，巩固国本，主要依靠什么？靠化肥，农药，柴油，拖拉机，也靠劳动者的素质。这几年，农业生产工具简陋，手段陈旧，投入不足，地力剧减，甚至出现大片大片抛荒的现象，致使粮食生产徘徊不前，暗藏危机，已引起社会各界的广泛关注。当人们在一阵紧似一阵地惊呼“农用物资涨价太快，谷贱伤农”之际，却有意无意地忽略了农村知识青年转移过猛、过快，农业人才流失太多，致使劳力结构、劳力素质每况愈下这个最危险的现实。
    农村知识青年竞相离土，形成一股“离土离乡热”，这即是当前农村青年的一个“热门话题”。
