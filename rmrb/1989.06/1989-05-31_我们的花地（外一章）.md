    Our Flower Field (and one more chapter)
    Sang Sang

    At that time, this place was as beautiful as a dream valley.
    Those were days without rain. There were dragonflies flying by, carrying vibrant sunlight on their wings, hoping for a serene smile in return.
    We would sit on the lush green grass, watching the clouds silently change shapes in the sky. At that time, the leaves were fresh like water, and the gentle breeze couldn't carry away the whispers in our ears.
    We no longer venture deep into the woods to search for a lost old straw hat, or the promises written by sunlight on the leaves. We only remember the twilight when the returning birds slowly merged into the sunset and never came back.
    In the cold nights, we would wake up for no reason, clearly recalling a long-ago excursion. The sunlight was generously coloring our black hair. Outside the window, the night was spreading endless blue mist.
    In the wind, we let the red leaves fall, like a glorious curtain call, telling people the end of the story. The autumn wind stripped the earth of its colors, but our flower field remained beautiful.

    The Flow of Years
    The years flow like water, passing by the doorstep.
    The starry tree stands tall outside the window, opening up a deep sky for the child who fears the dark. There, the stars are layered like leaves. The faint purple night pours down from the gaps between the leaves, blending into the water as pure as black hair. The wind comes, and the water's sound is like a sigh from another world. Paper boats sail by. White birds glide over the water's surface. The story must be heavy, for it can't be carried, so it silently runs aground on the shore.
    The colorful red leaves fall silently. They are eternal butterflies. In the clear water, they turn into a blazing star.
    The wandering soul on the other shore stands by the window, hearing the warm whispers from afar in the rustling wind.
    At that moment, the person by the window suddenly looks back. The flowing water stops like the sound of a lute, solidifying into spiral-shaped rocks. The starlight shimmers, decorating the child's sky. Countless silver fish dart past his distant gaze.

　　我们的花地（外一章）
    桑桑
    那时候，这里曾经美丽如梦之谷。
    那是些无雨的日子。还有蜻蜓飞过，翼上载着烂漫的阳光，祈盼着一个恬淡的微笑做回报。
    也曾坐在茵茵绿草上，看流云在天上无声地变幻着模样。那时候，树叶新鲜如水，和风带不走耳畔的低语。
    早已不再走进林子深处，去觅那一顶失落的旧草帽，还有阳光在树叶上写下的诺言。只记得暮霭四起时，归鸟缓缓地溶进夕照不再回来。
    还会在寒夜里无端地醒来，清晰地记起很久以前的一次远足，阳光尽情润染着黑发。而窗外，夜正弥漫着无尽的青雾。
    在风中听任红叶纷坠，如辉煌的谢幕，告诉人们故事的尾声。秋风褪尽了大地的颜色，而我们的花地，还依然美丽。
    　　　　流年
    流年似水，从门前汩汩流过。
    星星树兀立在窗外，给怕黑的孩子撑开一方深深的天空。那里，星星像树叶一样层叠杂陈。淡紫色的夜从叶隙间倾泻而下，融进纯净如黑发的水中。风走过来，水声恍若隔世的叹息。纸帆船开过。白色鸟滑翔在水面。那故事一定很重，它载不动了，便无言地搁浅在岸边。
    斑斓的红叶悄然坠落。那是永远的蝴蝶。在明澈的水中，化为一颗灼目的星。
    隔岸的游子，守望在窗前，在萧萧风声中，听到了远地温馨的呓语。
    那一刻，窗前的人蓦然回眸，流水如琴声戛然而止，凝固成螺纹的岩石。星光万点，装饰着孩子的天空。无数银色的游鱼掠过他遥遥的双眸。
