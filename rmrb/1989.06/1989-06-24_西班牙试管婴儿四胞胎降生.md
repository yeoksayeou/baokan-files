Spain's first in vitro fertilization quadruplets were born on June 21 in the southern city of Granada, but one of the infants has already died.

The father of the infants, Enrique Gonzalez, is a teacher at a school, and the mother, Inmaculada Gracía, is a nurse at a hospital.

The couple had been childless for many years. They underwent artificial insemination at the Granada Health Center and finally succeeded.

As early as 10 years ago, medical experts at the Granada Health Center began research on in vitro fertilization. So far, 12 test-tube babies have been born at the center.
