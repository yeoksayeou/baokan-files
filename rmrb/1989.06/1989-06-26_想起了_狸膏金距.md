In ancient times, people who engaged in cockfighting would use deceitful tactics. Since cats are skilled at catching chickens, they would apply cat grease on their own chickens' heads to make the opponent's chickens frightened by the scent of a cat. Alternatively, they would attach metal spurs to their chickens' claws, using these "advanced weapons" to scratch and injure the opponent's chickens until they bled profusely. In such unfair competitions, those who used "cat grease and metal spurs" would win, while those who did not would lose.

Today, similar forms of unfair competition can still be seen in economic activities. At the Beijing exhibition, there are many honest businesspeople who follow the rules. However, there are also those who use various tricks to deceive customers, and this is not an isolated case. Take the tactic of hiring "plants," for example. Those who use plants can pull and drag, coax and deceive, making their business thrive. These plants are much like the "cat grease" on a chicken's head and the "metal spurs" on a chicken's claws.

The tricks of "cat grease and metal spurs" are everywhere, and the reason lies in the fact that market regulations are not well-established. The market is like a sports field; what is allowed and what is not, the extent to which certain actions are permitted, and what behaviors should be punished by law, all need clear regulations. These regulations should have legal force and serve as a standard for everyone to follow. What is particularly important is that the enforcement of the law should be consistent. If a referee in a sports match favors one side, can the game continue? Similarly, in the market, everyone should be treated equally under the law and regulations. Otherwise, how can we prevent those who engage in "cat grease and metal spurs" from taking advantage and ensure that crooked methods are eliminated?

Ultimately, the existence of the "cat grease and metal spurs" phenomenon is a sign of underdeveloped commodity economy. Because commodities are generally in short supply, using "cat grease" or "metal spurs" can still yield profits. If the commodity economy were to develop, honest businesspeople would urgently unite to resist those who deceive and cheat, thus quickly establishing fair competition rules. If the production and sales of commodities were to flourish, creating a buyer's market where supply exceeds demand, consumers would naturally prefer honest businesspeople, making it easier for those who misuse "cat grease and metal spurs" to lose their market. Therefore, to completely overcome the "cat grease and metal spurs" phenomenon, we need to quickly establish regulations and accelerate the development of productive forces to strengthen the material foundation. The increase in material wealth takes time, and in a situation where supply is insufficient, it is particularly important to strengthen the construction of spiritual civilization and the education of professional ethics.

### 想起了“狸膏金距”

　　想起了“狸膏金距”
    瓯亮
    古时人们斗鸡，有滥施淫巧之计者，因狸善捕鸡，便在自家的鸡头上除涂狸膏，使对方的鸡闻到狸的气味而先胆怯；或者，在自家鸡爪上安装金属芒刺（金距），以此“尖端武器”将对手的鸡抓挠得鲜血淋漓。竞争不公平，有“狸膏金距”者胜，无者败。
    如今，类似“狸膏金距”式的不公平竞争，在经济生活中依然可见。北京的展销会上，老老实实照章办事的经营者不少；但变着法坑蒙拐骗顾客的也不是个别的。就以雇“托”这招而论，有“托”的，连拉带拽，连哄带骗，生意热闹。这“托”，就颇似鸡头之“狸膏”、鸡爪之“金距”。
    “狸膏金距”的伎俩，触目可见，其原因在于市场法则不健全。市场好比球场，什么准许，什么不准许，什么做法准许到多高程度，什么行为当受到法律制裁，均需有明确的规定。这规定，应具有法律的效力，作为准绳，人人遵守。特别重要的是执法应当一律。如果球赛的裁判偏袒一方，那球还能赛得下去吗？同理，在市场法令、法规面前，也应一律平等。否则，岂非助长惯为“狸膏金距”者的侥幸心理，使歪门邪道得不到禁绝么？
    说到底，“狸膏金距”现象的存在，是商品经济不发达的表现。正因为商品普遍地供不应求，你搞“狸膏”，我搞“金距”，都能捞一把。如果商品经济发达了，老实的经营者就会迫切地联合起来，与坑蒙拐骗的商贩抗争，使公平竞争的法则尽快健全。如果商品产销大大地繁荣起来，出现了供过于求的买方市场，广大消费者自然偏爱公道的商品经营者，滥用“狸膏金距”者便容易失去市场。可见，彻底制伏“狸膏金距”现象，既需要尽快建立法规，同时要加快生产力的发展，增强物质基础。物质财富的增加要有一个过程，在供不应求的情况下，加强精神文明建设，加强职业道德的教育，尤为重要。
