	Rules Ignored, Management in Chaos, Morals in Decline:
	Economic Crimes Rise in Shanghai's Financial System
	Thirty Cases in Five Months Involving Over 400,000 Yuan

	BEIJING, June 7 (Xinhua) -- The latest statistics from Shanghai reveal a significant increase in economic crimes within the city's financial system. From January to May this year, various banks reported 30 economic crime cases involving 30 individuals, with a total of 463,200 yuan in damages and 257,100 yuan in illegal personal gains. Among these, 12 cases involved amounts exceeding 100,000 yuan.

	The upward trend in economic crimes within Shanghai's financial system began to emerge in October last year. The primary causes of these incidents include corruption, bureaucratism, disregard for regulations, and chaotic management. Criminals exploit loopholes and employ various means to embezzle state property. For instance, an employee named Cui Tao from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's Huaihai Road Branch Savings Office embezzled 42,100 yuan from the cash box over 16 months and squandered the money. Another employee, Li Wenjun from the China Bank's Huaihai Road Branch, used blank passbooks and forged seals to embezzle 350,000 yuan in deposits.

	Of the 30 economic crime cases, 10 have been concluded. According to the financial system's disciplinary and supervisory departments, the trend of increasing economic crimes has not been effectively curbed. This criminal activity, which directly damages the bank's reputation and seriously harms national economic interests, has drawn the high attention of various banks and disciplinary, supervisory, and prosecutorial departments.

　　有章不循　管理混乱　风气败坏
    上海金融系统经济案件上升
    五个月发案三十起涉及金额四十余万
    本报上海６月７日电  记者刘士安报道：此间最新统计数字表明，上海市金融系统的经济案件明显上升。今年１至５月，各银行共发生经济案件３０起，作案３０人，涉及金额４６．３２万元，个人非法所得共２５．７１万元，其中万元以上大案１２起。
    上海金融系统经济案件上升趋势自去年１０月已显露。据了解，腐败风气、官僚主义、有章不循、管理混乱是此类案件发案的主要原因，作案人员想点子、钻空子，不择手段侵吞国家财产。工商银行卢湾区办淮海路第一储蓄所出纳员崔涛在１６个月中，从自己掌管的库款箱里侵吞贪污人民币４．２１万元，肆意挥霍。中国银行淮海路办事处出纳员李文君，利用保管员多发给她的空白活期存折，私刻复核员印章，伪造了储户的存折，伙同他人冒领存款３．５万元。
    目前，这３０起经济案件中已有１０起查处结束。据金融系统纪检监察部门的消息，上海金融系统经济发案上升趋势尚未得到有效的遏制。这种直接败坏银行信誉、严重危害国家经济利益的罪恶活动，已经引起各银行和纪检、监察、检察等部门的高度重视。
