    The Fuzhou Electrical Appliances Wholesale Company, while hosting the National Electrical Appliances Trade Fair, overcharged attendees, misappropriated public funds, and engaged in extravagant spending, wasting 359,000 yuan. The Supervision Department and the Ministry of Commerce, in conjunction with the Fujian Provincial Supervision Bureau, have conducted an investigation into this case.

    It is understood that the Fuzhou Electrical Appliances Wholesale Company held the National Electrical Appliances Trade Fair from May 23 to 27, 1988. The company collected various fees totaling 1,422,000 yuan from 3,475 attendees. Excluding conference expenses and surpluses, 359,000 yuan was misappropriated and wasted.

    The company invented various pretexts to distribute money and goods. From March 1988, when the conference preparation work began, to December of the same year, the company used the conference funds to distribute money and goods to its employees over a period of 10 months, totaling 132,700 yuan, averaging 976 yuan per person. The items distributed included fish, crabs, bamboo leaf green liquor, and honey.

    They also gave money and gifts (including blankets, lacquerware, cigarettes, liquor, and tea) to leaders of superior departments and relevant departments. Some superior departments also demanded the conference surplus funds. The company spent a total of 70,210 yuan on this.

    Before and after the trade fair, they frequently entertained and hosted guests, wasting 103,700 yuan. A single banquet after the conference for 220 relevant leaders and conference staff alone cost 25,600 yuan.

    The Fuzhou Electrical Appliances Wholesale Company also used the remaining conference funds as the company's "little treasury," appropriating 52,366 yuan for personal use.

    Currently, the Fujian Provincial Supervision Bureau, in conjunction with the Fuzhou Municipal Government, is handling the relevant personnel from the Fuzhou Municipal Finance Commission, the Municipal Commerce Bureau, and the Fuzhou Electrical Appliances Wholesale Company who are responsible for this incident.

　　福州交电批发公司办交易会挥霍浪费    
    主要责任者将受处罚
    本报北京６月２８日讯  记者吕建中、舒瑜从监察部获悉：福州市交电批发公司借承办全国交电商品交易会之机，多收会议代表费用，化公为私，铺张浪费，挥霍金额达３５．９万元。监察部、商业部会同福建省监察厅对此案进行了调查。
    据了解，福州市交电批发公司于１９８８年５月２３日至２７日承办全国交电商品交易会，共收与会代表３４７５人的各种费用１４２．２万元，除会议开支和结余外，化公为私，挥霍浪费达３５．９万元。
    这个公司巧立名目，乱发钱物。从１９８８年３月会议筹备工作开始，到会后１２月份止，在１０个月的时间内，该公司用这笔会议费，以各种名义向本公司职工发钱发物花掉１３．２７万元，人均９７６元，所发物品有鱼蟹、竹叶青酒、蜂蜜等。
    他们向上级主管部门的领导和有关部门发钱、赠物（有毛毯、漆器、烟、酒、茶等），有的上级部门也索要会议结余款。该公司用于这方面的开支共７０２１０元。
    交易会前后频繁招待和宴请，挥霍１０．３７万元。仅会后的一次宴请２２０名有关领导和会议工作人员就耗资２５６００元。
    福州市交电批发公司还把会议费的剩余款，作为公司的“小金库”，挪作自用的金额达５２３６６元。
    目前，福建省监察厅正会同福州市政府，对这一事件应负责任的福州市财委、市商业局、市交电批发公司有关人员进行处理。
