A section of the Baocheng Railway between Qiliaping and Shuangshipu, approximately 70 meters long, has been disrupted due to a landslide. Since yesterday at 11:30 AM, all passenger and freight trains have been halted, and emergency repairs are currently underway.

Yesterday morning, the flood monitoring point near the site of the incident detected cracks in the adjacent mountain. Railway personnel immediately implemented strict monitoring and other emergency measures. As the cracks in the mountain widened, the railway was promptly closed at 11:30 AM, and the Beijing to Chengdu Express Train No. 163, which was stranded in this section, was quickly returned to Fengzhou Station. No casualties were reported.

At 00:30 today, a report from the landslide site indicated that as the mountain continued to slide, the railway tracks were increasingly deformed and displaced. Sleepers were squeezed and stood upright, and the gaps between the rail joints were widened by 2-3 centimeters. The electrified contact network poles were bent or knocked over, and rocks continued to fall from the mountain.

Following the incident, leaders from the Xi'an Railway Bureau, including Bureau Chief Gong Deshun and Deputy Bureau Chief Xue Gui, arrived at the scene yesterday afternoon and last night to organize the rescue efforts.

The volume of soil and rock involved in this landslide is approximately 100,000 cubic meters.
