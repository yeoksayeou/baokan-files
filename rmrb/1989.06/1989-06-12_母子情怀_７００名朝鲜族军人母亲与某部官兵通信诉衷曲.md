Motherly Love
— 700 Korean Ethnic Soldiers' Mothers Write to Troops to Express Their Feelings

June 10, 700 Korean ethnic soldiers' mothers from Andong County, Jilin Province, sent a telegram to the martial law troops. The full text is as follows:

To all officers and soldiers of the martial law troops,

We are 700 Korean ethnic soldiers' mothers from Andong County, Jilin Province. In recent days, more than 20 of our families have received letters from our children, saying they are going to Beijing with you to carry out martial law duties. Since then, we, like all mothers of soldiers in the country, have been worried about you. Especially when we saw on TV that rioters were blocking, cursing, and beating you, and some soldiers were brutally killed by them, our hearts were broken. How could they be so cruel? It's no different from how the Japanese devils killed our anti-Japanese allied forces! In these days, we have been in front of the TV every day, hoping to see our children, not knowing if they are still alive? We hope they are safe. But we understand that without the stability of the country, there is no safety for ourselves. It is worth it to shed blood and sweat for the country. Children, you must listen to the Party and the Central Committee, listen to your superiors. You must not be merciful to those rioters, and you must not let them continue to harm the country, the people, and you children.

After seeing the telegram, the officers and soldiers of a certain unit expressed their hope to convey a reply to the 700 mothers and all mothers in the country through the media. The full text is as follows:

Recently, whenever night falls, your kind faces always appear in our tear-filled eyes. When we enlisted and said goodbye to you, your faces were filled with hot tears. There was joy for your sons, but also the bitterness of parting from your beloved children. There was pride in contributing your flesh and blood for the happiness of all people, but also worry for your sons' wandering in a foreign land. There was your silent encouragement, and there was your voiceless blessing... We never thought that today we would be on a mission in our capital, adding to your worries. I believe that recently, after listening to and watching the martial law news in the capital, you must be very sad, even afraid. When our trembling hands opened your telegram, we never expected that your lifelong kindness would suddenly show such rare strength and firmness! We will use our actions to fulfill your trust; we will use our blood and sweat to achieve stability and present it to your expectations, and use the annihilation of the rioters to sacrifice your martyred flesh and blood, to express our sorrow; we will use the creation of a brilliant future for our motherland to express our highest respect for you.

　　母子情怀
    ——７００名朝鲜族军人母亲与某部官兵通信诉衷曲
    ６月１０日，７００名朝鲜族军人母亲转交给戒严部队一封电报，全文如下：
    戒严部队全体官兵，俺们是吉林省和龙县７００名朝鲜族军人的母亲。前些日子，俺们有２０多家收到了自己孩子的来信，说他们要和你们一起到北京执行戒严任务。从那时起，俺们就和全国军人的母亲一样，都为你们提着心那！特别是在电视里看到暴徒拦劫你们，骂你们，打你们，有的战士被他们惨无人道地杀害了，俺们的心都要碎了。他们咋么那么狠呢？和日本鬼子杀害咱们抗联有什么两样！这些天，俺们每天都在电视机前，想看一看自己的孩子，不知他们还在不在？盼望他们平安。可俺们明白，没有国家的安定，哪有自己的安全。为国家流血流汗值得。孩子们，你们一定要听党和中央的话，听首长的话。对那些暴徒不能心慈手软，再也不能让他们继续祸害国家、祸害人民、祸害你们这些孩子们了。
    某部指战员看到电文后，纷纷希望通过新闻界向７００名阿妈妮及全国的母亲转达代表军人的回信，全文如下：
    近来，每当夜暮降临的时候，你们慈祥的面容总是浮现在我们盈眶的热泪中。在我们入伍向你们告别的时候，你们那满面的热泪，有为你们的儿子庆幸的喜悦，也有为你们朝夕相处的骨肉离别的割爱酸楚；有你们为天下人的幸福而捐献自己骨肉的自豪，也有为你们儿子飘泊异乡的担忧；有你们默默地鼓励，也有你们无声的祝愿……我们也没想到今天居然在自己的首都执行任务给你们增添了莫大的担忧，想必最近你们在收听收看首都戒严新闻后，一定很难过，甚至害怕，当我们颤抖的手打开你们发来的电报时，没想到你们平生的慈善刹那间崛出罕见的坚强、刚毅！我们将用行动来报效你们的重托；用我们的血汗去换取安定的成果来奉献你们的期望，用暴徒的灭亡来祭奠你们的被害骨肉，寄托我们的哀思；用创造祖国灿烂辉煌的明天来表达对你们的最崇高的敬意。
