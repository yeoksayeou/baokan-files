In a recent joint meeting of the Suzhou Regional Committee and the Administrative Office, it was unanimously decided to give all farmers in the region an "imperial sword." Farmers have the right to refuse to pay unreasonable deductions and levies imposed by various parties.

1. Farmers have the right to refuse to pay any deductions that exceed 3% of their annual net income. Last year, the average income per farmer in the region was 428 yuan. The Regional Committee has stipulated that the deduction per person should be limited to 14 yuan or less. Only the township government is authorized to determine the deduction items within the quota, and these must be approved by the township people's congress. Farmers have the right to refuse any fees or levies imposed by any department or unit for any reason outside of this. The Regional Committee has also decided that the People's Congress and various levels of financial, supervisory, disciplinary, audit, and agricultural economic departments will supervise the implementation. Typical cases of arbitrarily increasing, squandering, or embezzling deduction funds will be seriously investigated and dealt with.

2. Farmers have the right to refuse to pay the full year's deductions in one season during the summer harvest. The Regional Committee has stipulated that deductions should be made at a ratio of 40% in the summer and 60% in the autumn. In areas with good harvests, the deduction should not exceed 50% for both summer and autumn to facilitate farmers' investment in autumn production. Each locality must publicly disclose the deduction items, purposes, amounts, and methods to accept public supervision.

3. Farmers have the right to refuse to pay deductions that are not managed and used according to the new regulations. The Regional Committee has formulated new regulations for the management and use of deduction funds, which include separate accounts for township finances, unified management, expenditure based on income, strict approval, specific use, no overspending, and annual reporting to the township people's congress for pre- and post-budget audits, accepting review by people's representatives. If the new regulations are not followed, farmers have the right to refuse payment.

The suggestion to give farmers the right to refuse three types of unreasonable deductions was proposed by Regional Committee Secretary Lü Baocheng and decided by the joint meeting of the Regional Committee and the Administrative Office.

　　宿县地区给农民“尚方宝剑”
    谁都有权拒付不合理提留
    新华社合肥电  （通讯员侯先法、记者沈祖润）在最近召开的安徽省宿县地委、行署联合办公会议上，大家一致决定给全区农民一把“尚方宝剑”，对多方伸手乱提留、乱派款造成的不合理提留，农民有权三拒付。
    一拒付超过农户全年纯收入３％的提留款。去年全区农民人均收入４２８元，地委规定人均提留款限在１４元以下，只准乡政府一家在限额内确定提留项目，并经乡人代会批准。农民有权拒付除此以外任何部门、任何单位以任何借口的乱收费、乱派款。地委还决定由人大和各级财政、监察、纪检、审计、农经等部门监督执行；对任意增加、挥霍贪占提留款的典型，要认真查处。
    二拒付夏收一季要交全年提留款。地委规定提留按夏４秋６提取；丰收的地方，不得超过夏秋各半的比例，以利于农民对秋季生产的投资；各地要公开提留项目、用途、款额和办法，以接受群众监督。
    三拒付不按新章程管理使用的提留款。地委制定了各项提留款由乡财政单列帐户、统一管理、以收定支、严格审批、专款专用、不得超支、每年向乡人代会作预、决算报告，接受人民代表审查的管理使用新章程。如不按新章程办事，农民有权拒付。
    让农民有权三拒付不合理提留的建议，是地委书记吕保成提出，由地委、行署联合办公会议作出决定的。
