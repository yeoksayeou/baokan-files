The news that Li Qiang, Wang Xiaobing, and four other soldiers were burned to death in a military vehicle set on fire by counter-revolutionary rioters has sparked deep grief among the Party and government leaders, as well as the general public in Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City. They have flocked to the homes of the two martyrs to mourn the revolutionary heroes who sacrificed their lives for the country, to comfort the families of the martyrs, and to strongly condemn the inhuman atrocities committed by the counter-revolutionary rioters.

In the residential compounds of Lianhu Road Joint Venture Market and Northwest Electric Power Design Institute, where Wang Xiaobing and Li Qiang lived, memorial halls have been set up. The surroundings are filled with wreaths and banners with inscriptions such as "Eternal Glory to the Martyrs Who Sacrificed Their Lives for the Country" and "The Revolutionary Martyrs Will Live Forever." Classmates, childhood friends, leaders and colleagues from the units where the parents of the martyrs work, as well as neighbors, teachers, and students, have been continuously coming to pay their respects and offer condolences.

Deputy Governor of Shaanxi Province Xu Shanlin, Director of the Provincial Civil Affairs Department Ai Qiyu, and Mayor of Xi'an City Yuan Zhengzhong have successively gone to pay their respects to the martyrs. Deputy Governor Xu Shanlin told the parents of the two martyrs, "You have raised good sons who have shed their blood and sacrificed their lives to defend the People's Republic of socialism. They have died a noble death! This is your family's honor and pride, and it is also the honor and pride of the people of Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City." Wang Xiaobing's father, Deputy Researcher Wang Daming of the Xi'an Opera Research Institute, said, "My child sacrificed his precious life to quell the counter-revolutionary riot. As parents, we feel honored. Our entire family will learn from Xiaobing."
