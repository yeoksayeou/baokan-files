	Noriega Speaks Out Against U.S. Intervention in Panama
	Panama City, June 13 (Xinhua) -- According to a report by the Panama Television on the 12th, Panama Defense Forces Commander Noriega stated in a speech at the beginning of this month that the Panama issue can only be resolved by Panamanians themselves. He firmly opposes U.S. involvement in Panama's internal affairs.

	Noriega said that the Panama crisis can only be resolved through negotiations between the ruling party and the opposition. Neither the Panamanian military nor the U.S. should interfere in this process. He emphasized that the Panama crisis is entirely the result of U.S. intervention. Therefore, all parties should seek political solutions to the current crisis while excluding U.S. involvement.

	Noriega also stated that the Panamanian military will not use the issue of resolving the Panama crisis as a bargaining chip with the opposition.

　　诺列加发表谈话
    反对美干涉巴事务
    新华社北京６月１３日电  巴拿马城消息：据巴拿马电视台１２日报道，巴拿马国防军司令诺列加在本月初的一次谈话中表示，巴拿马问题只能由巴拿马人自己解决，坚决反对美国插手巴拿马内部事务。
    诺列加说，巴拿马危机只能通过执政党同反对党之间的谈判来寻找出路，无论是巴拿马军方还是美国方面，都不能对此进行干预。他强调，巴拿马危机完全是美国干涉造成的。因此，各党派应在排除美国插手的情况下寻求政治解决当前危机的办法。
    诺列加还说，巴拿马军方不会在寻求巴危机解决办法问题上同反对党“打牌”。
