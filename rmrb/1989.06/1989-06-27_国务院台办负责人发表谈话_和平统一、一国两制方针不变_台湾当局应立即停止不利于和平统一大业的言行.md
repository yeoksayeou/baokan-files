The spokesperson of the State Council's Taiwan Affairs Office, Tang Shubei, today spoke to Xinhua News Agency reporters. He stated: "Peaceful reunification, one country, two systems" is the policy our party and government adhere to in resolving the Taiwan issue. This fundamental national policy, formulated with the fundamental interests of all Chinese people, including the people of Taiwan in mind, will not change due to temporary circumstances, nor will it change in the future. The Chinese government will, based on this policy and relevant laws and regulations, continue to guarantee the personal and property safety and legitimate rights of Taiwanese compatriots engaged in activities such as visiting relatives, tourism, investment, business, and other legal activities on the mainland. We will continue to promote the "three links" (direct postal, transport, and trade links) and other exchanges between the two sides of the strait, and strive to advance the cause of national reunification.

Tang Shubei said that recently, some Taiwanese compatriots have written to express their understanding and support for the firm measures taken by the motherland's government to stop the counter-revolutionary riots. Many Taiwanese businesspeople have confidence in the stability and prosperity of the mainland and are not misled by temporary phenomena, continuing to invest in the mainland. We appreciate their far-sighted actions.

Tang Shubei pointed out that regrettably, the Taiwan authorities have repeatedly expressed "support" for the few individuals who instigated the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing. They have also taken some improper measures to fan the flames and stir up trouble. Some individuals have even made statements advocating the overthrow of the government of the People's Republic of China. At the same time, they continue to create "two Chinas" or "one China, one Taiwan" in the international arena. The Taiwan authorities should immediately stop all actions that create tension in cross-strait relations and are detrimental to the cause of peaceful reunification. Of course, we welcome the measures taken by the Taiwan authorities in recent years to relax cross-strait relations and objectively facilitate the "three links." We hope that the Taiwan authorities, with the long-term interests of the nation in mind, will follow the wishes of the people on both sides of the strait and do some concrete things for the peaceful reunification of the country.

Tang Shubei emphasized that in the future, the motherland's government will continue to adhere to the four cardinal principles and further reform and opening up. All policies and regulations that are conducive to the implementation of the "peaceful reunification, one country, two systems" policy will not only not change but will also be further enriched and improved. The government will continue to support and protect, in accordance with the law, the business activities of Taiwanese compatriots on the mainland. We will continue to do a good job in receiving Taiwanese compatriots visiting the mainland for family visits and tourism, and will continue to implement the State Council's "Regulations on Encouraging Investment by Taiwanese Compatriots." We will develop areas for Taiwanese investment, strengthen economic and trade exchanges and cooperation between the two sides, and at the same time, improve the investment environment and create better conditions for this exchange through regulations. We will also encourage and guide, in accordance with relevant regulations, the normal exchanges in culture, sports, science and technology, and academia between the two sides.

Tang Shubei finally expressed that we sincerely hope to work with various parties, organizations, and people from all walks of life in Taiwan to strengthen cross-strait cooperation and promote the process of national reunification. We hope that the Taiwan authorities will adopt a wise attitude on cross-strait relations, so that people on both sides can have two-way, direct, and equal exchanges, and that various exchanges in culture, sports, science and technology, and academia between the two sides can be widely carried out.

　　国务院台办负责人发表谈话     
    和平统一、一国两制方针不变    
    台湾当局应立即停止不利于和平统一大业的言行
    新华社北京６月２７日电  国务院台湾事务办公室副主任唐树备今天对本社记者发表谈话指出：“和平统一、一国两制”是我们党和政府解决台湾问题遵循的方针。这一项从全体中国人民包括台湾人民的根本利益出发制定的基本国策，不会因一时形势的影响而改变，今后也不会改变。中国政府将根据上述方针和有关法律、政策，继续保障在大陆从事探亲、旅游、投资、经商和其他一切合法活动的台胞的人身财产安全和正当权益，继续促进海峡两岸的“三通”和其它方面的交往，努力推动国家和平统一事业的进程。
    唐树备说，最近有些台胞来信，对祖国政府采取坚决措施制止反革命暴乱表示理解和支持。不少台湾实业界人士，对祖国大陆的安定和繁荣怀有信心，不为一时的现象所迷惑，继续在大陆投资。我们赞赏他们这种有远见的作为。
    唐树备指出，令人遗憾的是，台湾当局对制造北京反革命暴乱的极少数人，一再表示“支援”，还采取一些不正当的手段，煽风点火，推波助澜，个别人甚至发表推翻中华人民共和国政府的言论。与此同时，他们还继续在国际上制造“两个中国”、“一中一台”。台湾当局应当立即停止所有在两岸关系上制造紧张、不利于和平统一大业的言行。当然，我们对台湾当局近年来所采取的松动两岸关系、客观上有利于“三通”的举措是欢迎的。我们希望台湾当局以民族的长远利益为重，顺应两岸人民的愿望，为国家的和平统一做一些实实在在的事。
    唐树备强调指出，今后，祖国政府将继续坚持四项基本原则，进一步改革开放。一切有利于实现“和平统一、一国两制”方针的政策法规，不但不会改变，而且将继续充实、完善。对台胞在大陆的经贸业务，政府会一如既往地根据法律予以支持和保护。我们对遵照祖国政府的一贯政策，进一步做好台胞来大陆探亲、旅游的接待工作，继续认真贯彻执行国务院关于《鼓励台湾同胞投资的规定》，办好台资开发区，加强两岸经贸往来和合作，同时进一步改善投资环境，从法规上为这一交往创造更好的条件。对两岸开展的文化、体育、科技、学术等正常交往，也将按有关规定予以鼓励和引导。
    唐树备最后表示，我们诚挚地期望同台湾各党派、各团体和各界人士共同努力，加强两岸合作，促进国家统一的进程；希望台湾当局在两岸关系问题上采取明智的态度，使两岸人员得以双向、直接、对等的往来，使两岸间的文化、体育、科技和学术等各种交流广泛地展开。
