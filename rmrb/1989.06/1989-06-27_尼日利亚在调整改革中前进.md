Nigeria Advances Through Adjustment and Reform

This year marks the third year of Nigeria's implementation of its economic structural adjustment plan. After more than two years of adjustment and reform, Nigeria's gross domestic product has shifted from a decline to a gradual increase. In 1988, Nigeria's GDP grew by 4.1%; non-oil product exports reached over $900 million, nearly doubling the 1987 figure. The self-sufficiency rate of raw materials in the manufacturing industry increased from 46% in 1987 to 50%, with some light industry sectors achieving an 88% self-sufficiency rate. Nigeria has taken a significant step forward in its economic adjustment and reform.

Nigeria is a large African country with a population of over 100 million and abundant resources, particularly oil. Over the past 20 years, various international and domestic factors have led Nigeria through numerous twists and turns in its economic development. The experiences and lessons of Nigeria are worth learning from for many developing countries. Originally, Nigeria was known for its large-scale exports of cocoa, palm oil, rubber, and peanuts, making it an agricultural powerhouse. In the mid-1960s, agricultural products accounted for 60% of Nigeria's GDP, and agricultural exports made up 70% of total export earnings. Starting in the 1970s, the oil industry rapidly developed, transforming Nigeria into Africa's largest oil-producing country. Oil brought in dollars but also brought misfortune. Due to the neglect of agriculture, a large number of laborers migrated to cities, leading to severe imbalances in the national economy and a distorted economic structure. By 1980, agricultural output accounted for only 18% of the total GDP, and agricultural exports made up just 2.6% of total export earnings. Food production shifted from self-sufficiency to requiring large-scale imports. Nigeria's over-reliance on oil determined its economic fragility. When international oil prices fell in the mid-1980s, oil revenues dropped from a peak of $25 billion in 1980 to around $7-8 billion, pushing Nigeria's entire economy to the brink of collapse. By 1985, external debt had reached $20 billion, inflation was at 40%, foreign trade had almost stalled, and the manufacturing industry's operating rate was only 30%. Many enterprises and schools closed due to the inability to pay wages; unemployment was severe. Among the state-owned enterprises with investments totaling over 300 billion naira, many were running at a loss year after year. Faced with these harsh realities, the Nigerian government called on the people to unite and overcome difficulties. With the support of international financial organizations like the World Bank, Nigeria decided in July 1986 to implement an economic structural adjustment plan. The plan aims to achieve product diversification and domestic raw material production, reduce dependence on oil and imported raw materials, and increase self-sufficiency. It also promotes trade liberalization and vigorously develops an export-oriented economy to increase foreign exchange earnings and expand employment.

During the adjustment and reform process, the Nigerian government has taken a series of measures: opening a foreign exchange market to allow the naira (the national currency) to float freely based on market factors; abolishing the import permit system, promoting free trade, and offering various incentives to encourage private businesses to engage in export activities; abolishing the state-run procurement agencies for economic crops and grains, and liberalizing agricultural product prices. These reform measures have reduced state intervention in economic life, facilitated the role of the market mechanism, revitalized the economy, and expanded exports.

A notable feature of Nigeria's adjustment and reform is the government's more proactive attitude in encouraging and supporting private enterprises to participate in the economic revival plan, allowing private enterprises to play a greater role in national economic life. In the past two years, the banking sector has been particularly active in the adjustment and reform process, with the number of commercial banks growing from 47 in 1987 to 81 by the end of 1988. The operating rate of the manufacturing industry has risen to 40.7%. In January of this year, President Babangida, in a speech at the future capital of Abuja, said he hopes that the chairmen of large private companies will take the lead in economic revival and international competition. President Babangida also announced a new industrial policy aimed at improving the investment environment and attracting private investment. To support medium and small enterprises facing financial and foreign exchange difficulties, the Nigerian government recently formally established the "National Economic Reconstruction Fund," which has raised $550 million and 3 billion naira. Additionally, the privatization and commercialization of state-owned enterprises are being implemented in a planned and gradual manner.

Prioritizing agricultural production is a key aspect of Nigeria's economic structural adjustment. In 1988, the Nigerian government launched the "Food Production First" campaign in rural areas and has published a new agricultural policy. The policy states that Nigeria's agricultural economy is based on small-scale farming. Various levels of government are providing agricultural loans, implementing agricultural insurance plans, promoting agricultural technology, and supplying fertilizers at affordable prices to support and develop small-scale farming. To gradually achieve food self-sufficiency and protect domestic agriculture, the government began prohibiting the import of wheat, flour, and corn in 1987. Last year, the government focused on wheat production. It is estimated that this year, the six states in the north planting wheat will harvest 300,000 tons. In 1987, cotton production increased fivefold compared to 1986, reaching 300,000 bales.

Currently, Nigeria's oil income remains the main source of foreign exchange earnings, and the oil industry holds a pivotal position. The Nigerian government is making significant adjustments to its national energy policy, aiming to fully utilize the country's resource advantages. While developing the oil industry, it is also promoting product diversification and gradually shifting the focus to natural gas projects.

Nigeria has paid a significant price in its adjustment and reform process. As President Babangida said, Nigeria's economic structural adjustment requires the people to make some painful sacrifices. Due to the sharp devaluation of the naira, prices have skyrocketed. In 1988, the fiscal deficit reached 8.5 billion naira. Currently, Nigeria's external debt has increased to $30 billion. Each year, $2 billion is allocated to repay debt principal and interest, accounting for about 30% of foreign exchange earnings. These difficulties sometimes force economic construction to slow down, but the Nigerian government is determined to move forward with the economic structural adjustment plan and strive to find a way out of the predicament.

　　尼日利亚在调整改革中前进
    孙诗宾
    今年是尼日利亚联邦共和国实行经济结构调整计划的第三个年头。经过两年多的调整和改革，尼日利亚国内生产总值由过去的下降转变为缓步上升。１９８８年尼日利亚国内生产总值增长４．１％；非石油产品出口收入达９亿多美元，比１９８７年增加近一倍；制造业中原料的自给率从１９８７年的４６％上升到５０％，少数轻工部门原料自给率已达８８％。尼日利亚在经济调整和改革的道路上已经迈出了可喜的一步。
    尼日利亚是个非洲大国，人口有一亿多，资源丰富，盛产石油。由于国际国内的各种因素，近２０多年来尼日利亚在经济发展道路上几经波折，而它的经验教训也是许多发展中国家值得借鉴的。尼日利亚原是一个以大宗出口可可、棕榈油、橡胶、花生等农产品闻名于世的农业国。６０年代中期，尼日利亚的农产品占国内生产总值的６０％，农产品出口收入占总出口收入的７０％。７０年代起，石油工业异军突起，尼日利亚一跃成为非洲最大的产油国。石油给尼日利亚带来美元，同时也给它带来厄运。由于农业被忽视，大量劳动力流入城市，国民经济比例严重失调，经济结构出现畸形。１９８０年农业产值只占国内总产值的１８％，农产品出口收入仅占总出口收入的２．６％，粮食由自给有余变为需大量进口。尼日利亚对石油的过份依赖决定了它在经济上的脆弱性。当８０年代中期国际石油价格下跌，石油收入从１９８０年的２５０亿美元最高峰下跌到７０至８０亿左右，尼日利亚整个经济几乎面临崩溃。１９８５年外债已达２００亿美元，通货膨胀率高达４０％，外贸几乎停顿，制造业开工率仅３０％；许多企业、学校因发不出工资而关闭；失业问题严重。在投资达３００多亿奈拉的国营企业中，不少企业连年亏损。在上述严酷的现实面前，尼日利亚政府号召人民同心协力，渡过难关，并在世界银行等国际金融组织的支持下于１９８６年７月决定执行经济结构调整计划。该计划旨在实现产品多样化和原料国产化，改变对石油和进口原料的过份依赖，提高自给程度；实行贸易自由化，大力发展外向型经济，以增加外汇收入和扩大就业。
    尼日利亚政府在调整改革过程中，采取了一系列措施：开辟外汇市场，让奈拉（本国货币）汇率按市场因素自由浮动；取消进口许可证制度，实行自由贸易并以种种优惠，鼓励私商经营出口业务；取消国家为统购统销经济作物和谷物而设立的各收购局，放开农产品价格。这些改革措施使国家对经济生活的干预减少，利于发挥市场机制，搞活经济，扩大出口。
    尼日利亚政府在调整改革中的一个明显特点是以更加积极的态度，鼓励并支持私营企业参加经济复兴计划，让私人企业在国民经济生活中发挥更大的作用。近２年来，银行界在调整改革中表现尤为活跃，全国工商银行从１９８７年的４７家到１９８８年底已发展到８１家。１９８８年制造业的开工率已上升到４０．７％。今年１月，巴班吉达总统在未来的首都阿布贾发表讲话说：他希望私营大公司董事长在复兴经济和国际竞争中起领导作用。巴班吉达总统还宣布了一项新的工业政策，目的是改善投资环境，吸引私人投资。为了扶植面临资金、外汇困难的中小企业，尼日利亚政府最近正式设立了“国家经济建设基金”，该项基金已筹措到资金５．５亿美元和３亿奈拉。另外，国营企业私有化和商业化正在有计划地逐步实施。
    优先发展农业生产是尼日利亚经济结构调整的重点之一。１９８８年尼日利亚政府在农村开展了“粮食生产第一”运动，政府已公布新农业政策，其中提出尼日利亚农业经济是以小农为基础的。各级政府通过发放农业贷款实施农业保险计划、推广农业技术和平价供应化肥来扶植、发展小农经济。为了逐步实现粮食自给，保护本国农业，１９８７年开始政府禁止进口小麦、面粉和玉米。去年政府重点抓了小麦生产。预计今年北方种植小麦的六个州可收获小麦３０万吨。１９８７年棉花产量比１９８６年增加五倍，达３０万包。
    目前尼日利亚的石油收入仍是其外汇收入的主要来源，石油工业占有举足轻重的地位，尼政府正在对国家能源政策作出具有重大意义的调整，即充分利用本国资源的优势，在发展石油工业的同时，努力促进石油产品多样化，并逐步把开发重点转向天然气工程。
    尼日利亚在进行调整改革中是付出了巨大代价的。正如巴班吉达总统所说：尼日利亚经济结构调整是需要人民作出一些痛苦的牺牲的。
    由于奈拉大幅度贬值，物价成倍上涨。１９８８年财政赤字高达８５亿奈拉。目前尼日利亚外债已增至３００亿美元。每年需拨出２０亿美元来偿付债务的本息，占外汇收入的３０％左右。这些困难使经济建设有时不得不放慢速度，但是尼日利亚政府决心朝着经济结构调整计划的目标走下去，努力找出一条摆脱困境的发展道路。
