Your newspaper published my article and photograph titled "What Kind of Skin Are You Pulling?" on the fifth page of the November 2, 1988 issue. Following this, the government of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region and the government of Ba League convened multiple meetings with relevant departments of the railway and highway, as well as representatives from the Wula Mountain Power Plant. They reached an agreement and actively created conditions for construction. The new highway officially opened to traffic on April 30 of this year.

All employees of our factory and the people of the Wula Mountain area express our gratitude to the Party newspaper for daring to speak up for the people, which helped resolve the issue promptly.

专栏：批评以后

　　路障变通途  人民心欢畅
    你报一九八八年十一月二日第五版刊登了我写的《扯的哪门子皮》及图片后，内蒙古自治区政府和巴盟政府召集铁路、公路有关部门及乌拉山电厂各方，多次商谈达成协议，并积极创造条件施工。新公路已在今年四月三十日正式通车。
    我厂全体职工及乌拉山地区人民，感谢党报敢于为人民仗义直言，促成了问题的早日解决。
