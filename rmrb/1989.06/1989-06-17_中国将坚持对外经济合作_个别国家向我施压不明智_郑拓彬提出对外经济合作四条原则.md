Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 17th.

China will persist in foreign economic cooperation. It is unwise for some countries to pressure us. Zheng Tuobin proposes four principles for foreign economic cooperation.

Minister of the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, Zheng Tuobin, recently said at a meeting of cadres and workers in the foreign trade and economic sectors in Beijing that it is very unwise for the governments of some countries to use economic means to exert pressure and rudely interfere in China's internal affairs. China will continue to persist in developing foreign economic and technological cooperation. He hopes that these countries' governments and some politicians will return to the path of developing mutually beneficial cooperation with China.

Zheng Tuobin said that the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing have caused some difficulties for China's development of foreign economic and technological cooperation. Some countries have misunderstandings about China. Most developing countries and the governments of most socialist countries understand and support China's suppression of the riot and are willing to continue developing economic and trade relations with China. Among the developed countries, most do not want this to affect bilateral economic and technological cooperation. During this period, many countries' governments and international organizations, with an eye on the future, have insisted on actively developing economic and technological cooperation with China. However, after China suppressed the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, some governments and individual politicians, disregarding the facts, shortsightedly stopped providing loans and aid to China, froze technology transfers, and exerted pressure on China, rudely interfering in China's internal affairs. Zheng Tuobin said that these countries' governments and individual politicians have misjudged the situation. He hopes they will respect objective facts, broaden their vision, and continue to develop bilateral political and economic relations with China.

Zheng Tuobin proposed that in the future development of foreign economic cooperation, the following principles should be adhered to:

1. Except for cooperation projects that have already been affected by the actions of the other party, all work should be done to ensure that they are not affected by our side.
2. For activities already arranged by both Chinese and foreign parties or already signed agreements and contracts, if the foreign party has not taken any action to suspend them, all relevant foreign work by our side should proceed as usual. If the foreign party uses the suppression of the riot as an excuse to adopt measures such as cancellation, freezing, suspension, or postponement to exert pressure, we should take a firm stand and engage in necessary struggles. Domestic relevant units should do a good job in follow-up work to minimize losses.
3. Take effective measures to ensure the safety of foreign businessmen in China, ensure the normal operation of foreign-invested enterprises, and let more foreign businessmen see that the situation in China is stable and that investing in China can yield the expected benefits.

　　中国将坚持对外经济合作
    个别国家向我施压不明智
    郑拓彬提出对外经济合作四条原则
    本报讯  经贸部部长郑拓彬日前在北京召开的经贸界干部职工会议上说，个别国家的政府采用经济手段施加压力，粗暴干涉中国内政，是很不明智的。我国将继续坚持发展对外经济技术合作，希望这些国家政府和个别政界人物，回到同中国发展互利合作的道路上来。
    郑拓彬说，近来北京发生的动乱和反革命暴乱给中国发展对外经济技术合作造成一定的困难，有些国家对我国产生一些误解。广大的发展中国家、大多数社会主义国家的政府对我平息暴乱是理解的，愿意继续发展同我国的经济贸易关系。在发达国家中，多数国家也都不愿意因此而影响双方的经济技术合作。其间许多国家政府和国际组织着眼于未来，坚持积极开展对华经济技术合作业务。但在我国平息北京反革命暴乱后，也有某些政府和个别政治家，不顾事实真相，以谣言为依据，目光短浅，停止向我国提供贷款、援助，冻结技术转让，向我施加压力，粗暴干涉中国内政。郑拓彬说，这些国家政府和个别政界人物看错了形势，希望他们尊重客观事实，把眼光放远一点，继续发展同中国的双边政治经济关系。
    郑拓彬提出，在今后发展对外经济合作中要坚持几条原则：一，除外方已采取行动而受影响的合作业务外，都要做好工作，绝不能由于我方的原因使之受到影响；二，对中外双方已安排好的活动或已签订的协议、合同项目，外方未采取任何中止行动的，我方有关各种对外工作要一切照常进行；外方如以平息暴乱为由采用取消、冻结、中止、推迟等方式施加压力，我要坚持严正立场，进行必要的斗争，国内有关单位做好善后工作，把损失减少到最低限度；四，采取有力措施，保证在华外商安全，保证三资企业正常生产，让更多的外商看到中国的局势是稳定的，在中国投资能获得应有的利益。
