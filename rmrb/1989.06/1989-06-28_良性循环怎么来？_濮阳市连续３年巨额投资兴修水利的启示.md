    This is a set of thought-provoking comparative figures from Puyang City, Henan Province:
    In 1986, 20 million yuan was invested in water conservancy projects, resulting in an annual grain increase of 60,000 tons.
    In 1987, another 20 million yuan was invested, leading to an increase of 90,000 tons.
    In 1988, 20 million yuan was invested again, resulting in an increase of 58,000 tons.
    If we consider that this newly established city with a population of over 2.8 million and 3.9 million mu of arable land was once a notorious disaster-prone area, we can see the significant role water conservancy played in increasing grain production.

    Early Investment, Early Benefits

    The five counties and one district under Puyang's jurisdiction have 163 kilometers of the Yellow River running through them, not to mention the several times altered old riverbeds and the low-lying areas behind the river. This area was once famous for being a disaster-prone region.

    The primary condition for Puyang to change its impoverished face is to increase grain production. But where should the breakthrough be made? In 1986, the new leadership of the municipal Party committee and government, with the economic mindset of "no investment, no output" from the oil industry, proposed the strategic idea of "water control and agricultural development." To implement this strategy, investment in agriculture must be increased, and this is particularly difficult for Puyang. The newly established city is still just a blueprint. From the secretary and mayor to ordinary cadres, they all live in makeshift office-residence combinations. Industry, commerce, education, health, and municipal construction—all sectors are in urgent need of funds. Despite this, the municipal leaders still managed to allocate over 20 million yuan from the local budget to concentrate on the first major project of widening the Puyang-Qinghe South Yellow River irrigation and drought relief water source.

    20 million yuan accounts for approximately 14% of Puyang's local fiscal expenditure that year, which requires tremendous resolve! In this project, the mayor and the secretary of the municipal Party committee personally took on the roles of commander and political commissar, respectively. The command center was set up on the construction site. Each county, township, and village dispatched capable cadres to the front lines to take responsibility for investment, tasks, quality, and deadlines, and signed military orders, with rewards and punishments based on performance. The masses heard that canals were being dug to bring in water and eagerly participated. During the construction peak, over 40,000 people participated.

    Investment Must Follow Natural Laws

    The primary factor for Puyang's poverty is water. Over the past 30-plus years since the founding of the nation, the Party and the government have conducted multiple treatments of the Yellow River's sandy areas and the low-lying areas behind the river, investing a significant amount of funds. However, the results were often disappointing.

    Despite the substantial investments and efforts, why were the results not satisfactory? The city's leaders repeatedly pondered this question. They conducted numerous investigations and organized over 200 technical personnel to conduct on-site surveys and comparisons, inviting experts and professors to provide evidence. Finally, they decided to change the previous scattered investment approach, concentrating funds for scientific deployment and focusing on key developments. The investment focus shifted from digging rivers and building canals to constructing high-platform sealed wells and building mobile irrigation stations. Once the new development policy was determined, the city concentrated its material and financial resources, mobilizing 150,000 people along the Yellow River to work tirelessly for a winter and spring, drilling 250 high-platform sealed wells, building 2,032 bridges, dams, and gates, renovating 4 Yellow River diversion gates, and expanding the effective irrigation area by 170,000 mu. Subsequently, they conducted soil improvement and trial rice cultivation over 100,000 mu, achieving an average yield of 300 kilograms of grain per mu. The initial success gave people hope. The village of Wangyao, known for its single men, sent a representative to the mayor's home with a bag of clean rice to express their gratitude for escaping poverty, saying, "This is much better than the government buying and sending us grain."

    Money must be spent wisely. In recent years, Puyang has strictly controlled every investment project. To avoid blind investments and waste, they insisted on piloting each investment project before expanding it from point to surface.

    Puyang County's Li Yuan Township organized 14 administrative villages to conduct scientific investment and comprehensive treatment, achieving a quadruple increase in total grain production, yield per mu, yield per person, and income per person in one year. Their experience was quickly promoted throughout the city.

    Various Forms of Investment

    People use "invest 1, gain 3" or "invest 1, gain 5" to describe the economic benefits of investment and output. If it is so effective, why not do it? Thus, various forms of investment emerged.

    The city built a textile factory, adopting the method of workers bringing capital to work and mobilizing social funds, making the project start quickly; larger agricultural markets, as well as shops and hotels, were mostly invested in by merchants themselves, with the city organizing them uniformly. Funds flowed continuously. These seem to have nothing to do with agricultural investment at first glance. How are they related? The city's leaders said that these few items reduced the city's pressure by nearly 1,000 ten thousand yuan, and the saved money was used to invest in agriculture. This is called "indirect investment." The city is like this, and the counties, townships, and villages are also very proactive. Fan County is a famous poor county, but in water conservancy investment, it spared no effort, digging large and small canals totaling over 200, with a total length of over 400 kilometers, equivalent to the distance from Fan County to Beijing. These projects quickly reversed the situation of poverty.

    In Maozhao Village, Taiqian County, the main canal leading to the Yellow River needs to occupy 6 mu of farmland from a neighboring village. After several negotiations, they agreed to pay an annual rent of 150 kilograms of wheat and 100 kilograms of soybeans per mu, signing a three-year contract with the neighboring village. This immediately expanded the irrigation area by nearly 1,000 mu, allowing the entire village's 7 mu of farmland to be irrigated in 7 days. That year, wheat increased by 100 kilograms per mu, and soybeans increased by over 50 kilograms, with per capita income increasing by 124 yuan. They said, "There's always a way when you reach the mountain."

    There are also party members and cadres leading the way to collectively fund and manage water conservancy projects, state employees donating to build water conservancy projects, a few households jointly managing, a few groups jointly managing, and a few villages jointly managing. Farmer professional well-digging teams and old well maintenance teams, mainly engaged in management and services, are active throughout the fields.

    Statistics show that since 1986, the city has dug and repaired 4,670 canals, drilled nearly 7,000 new wells, with a total of over 41,000 wells, equipped with nearly 40,000 wells, and an effective irrigation area of 2.92 million mu, accounting for 75% of the total arable land. This has formed a water conservancy project system that can irrigate during droughts, drain during floods, and treat alkalinity, greatly improving agricultural production conditions. This is why there has been continuous increased production as mentioned earlier.

　　良性循环怎么来？    
    ——濮阳市连续３年巨额投资兴修水利的启示
    何永增
    这是河南省濮阳市一组发人深思的比较数字：
    １９８６年，水利建设投资２０００万元，当年粮食增产６万吨。
    １９８７年，又投入２０００万元，又增产９万吨。
    １９８８年，再次投入２０００万元，再次增产５．８万吨。
    如果考虑到这个有２８０多万人口、３９０万亩耕地的新建市本是个老灾区，就会看到水利在粮食增产中所占的份量。
    　　　　早投入早受益
    濮阳所辖的５县１区，仅沿黄线就有１６３公里，更不用说几经改向的黄河故道和背河洼地了。这里过去是出了名的老灾区。
    濮阳市改变贫困面貌的首要条件是提高粮食产量，而增加粮食产量的突破口选在哪里呢？１９８６年新的市委、市政府领导班子凭着不投入就不会大产出的抓石油工业的经济头脑，提出了“治水兴农”的战略思想。要实施这一战略，就要加大对农业的投资，而这对濮阳来说尤其困难？新建城市还是一纸蓝图，从书记、市长到一般干部住的还是寝办合一的简易房子，工业、商业、文教卫生、市政建设，百业待举，急需用钱。尽管如此，市领导还是从地方财政挤出了２０００多万元集中用于拓宽第一条濮清南引黄抗旱补源骨干工程。
    ２０００万元，约占濮阳市当年地方财政支出的１４％强，这需要下多么大的决心！在这项工程中，市长、市委书记还分别担任工程指挥长和政委。指挥部就设在工地上，各县、乡、村，抽调得力干部到第一线包投资，包任务，包质量，包工期，并立下军令状，根据完成情况兑现奖罚。广大农民听说要挖渠引水，踊跃参加，施工高潮，参加的有４万多人。
    　　　　投入要顺应自然规律
    濮阳市贫困的主要因素是水。建国３０多年来，党和政府曾对沿黄滩区和背河洼地进行过多次治理，投入了不少资金，但大都事倍功半。
    钱没少花，事没少做，为什么效果不佳，教训在哪里？濮阳市的当家人反反复复地思考着。他们一次次深入调查，还组织２００多名科技人员深入实地勘查比较，请来专家教授论证。最后，决定一改过去撒胡椒面的投入形式，将资金集中使用，科学投放，重点开发，投资重点由挖河修渠转向高台密封井，兴建移动提灌站。新的开发方针一经确定，市里就集中物力、财力，动员了沿黄１５万群众大干了一个冬春，打高台密封井２５０眼，新建桥涵闸门２０３２座，改建引黄闸门４座，扩大有效灌溉面积１７万亩。接着，改土试种水稻１０万亩，取得了平均亩产粮食３００公斤的好收成。初战告捷使人们看到了光明，老光棍村王窑派出了自己的代表，将一袋透净的大米背到了市长的家里以表感谢脱贫之情，他们说：这可比政府拿钱买粮送给我们高兴。
    花钱就要花到地方，濮阳市近几年对每一笔投入项目都严格把关。为了避免盲目投资造成浪费，坚持了对所投资项目先搞试点，再由点到面加以推广。
    濮阳县梨园乡组织１４个行政村搞科学投入综合治理，一年实现粮食总产、亩产、人均产、人均收入４个翻番。他们的经验很快在全市加以推广。
    　　　　各式各样的投入形式
    人们用投１增３或投１收５来比喻投入和产出的经济效益。既然如此灵验，那么人们何乐而不为呢？于是各式各样的投入形式也应运而生。
    市里兴建一座纺织厂，他们采取工人带资就业和动员社会集资的办法，使工程很快开工；比较大型的农贸市场，以及商店旅馆也大都由商户们自己投资，市里统一组织等形式，资金竟源源不断。这些乍听起来似乎与农业的投入没有关系。怎么没有关系呢？市府的领导同志说，这几项就减轻了市里近千万元的压力，省出的钱又用来投入到农业上了。这叫“迂回投资”。市里是这样，县里、乡里、村里也主动得很。范县是有名的穷县，在水利投资上却是不遗余力，开挖大小渠道２００多条，全长４００多公里，相当于范县到北京的路程，这些工程迅速扭转着贫困的局面。
    台前县的姚邵村，通向黄河的干渠，需占用邻村６亩耕地，几经协商，他们以每亩一年１５０公斤小麦、１００公斤大豆的租用报酬，与邻村签订了３年合同，一下扩大灌溉面积近千亩，使全村的全部耕地７天即可普浇一遍水，当年小麦每亩增产１００公斤，大豆增产５０多公斤，人均收入一年增加１２４元。他们说这叫车到山前必有路。
    还有党员干部带头集资自办水利的，国家职工捐资办水利的，几户联办的，几组联办的，几村联办的。以经营服务为主的农民专业打井队，旧井维修队等活跃在整个田野。
    据统计，１９８６年以来，全市共开挖、整修沟渠４６７０多条，新打机井近７０００眼，机井总数达到４．１万多眼，配套近４万眼，有效灌溉面积达２９２万亩，占总耕地面积的７５％，形成了遇旱能浇，遭涝能排，遇碱能治的水利工程体系，大大改变了农业生产条件，因而才有了前面所说的连年增产的情况。
