The China Democratic National Construction Association (CDNCA) held a meeting in Beijing today, attended by the Chairman, Vice-Chairmen in Beijing, the Chairman of the Consultative Committee, and members of the Executive Bureau. The meeting focused on studying and discussing the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The attendees unanimously agreed that the Fourth Plenary Session is a highly significant meeting in the history of the Communist Party of China. The decisions made at the session are of great importance and will have a profound impact on further stabilizing the country and ensuring that the nation and its people continue to advance along the path set by the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee. We fully support these decisions.

The attendees noted that, reflecting on the lessons from the past decade of reform and the recent disturbances caused by a few individuals exploiting student protests to incite political turmoil and even counter-revolutionary riots in the capital, we have come to a clearer understanding. The Four Cardinal Principles and the policy of reform and opening up are indispensable guarantees for the smooth development of China's socialist modernization. We must never relax or deviate from these two fundamental points. The attendees unanimously agreed that the Fourth Plenary Session's emphasis on reaffirming the Four Cardinal Principles as the foundation of the state and reform and opening up as the path to strength is timely and necessary. Members of the CDNCA should continue to unwaveringly integrate these two fundamental points into all our work.

The attendees also pointed out that the Fourth Plenary Session's proposal to focus on four major tasks is practical and aligns with the expectations of the people nationwide, as well as the wishes of the broad membership of the CDNCA. We must actively respond to the call of the Fourth Plenary Session, boost our spirits, unite closely around the Communist Party of China, and use the spirit of Deng Xiaoping's important speech on June 9 as our guide. We should better leverage the unique strengths of the CDNCA, cooperate with the Communist Party and the government, and strive to accomplish the tasks set forth by the Fourth Plenary Session.

The meeting was chaired by Na Sun Qimeng, Chairman of the CDNCA. Sun Xiaocun, Chairman of the CDNCA Consultative Committee, and Vice-Chairmen Wan Guangquan, Feng Ti Yun, Huang Daneng, Bai Da Hua, and other responsible comrades attended the meeting.
