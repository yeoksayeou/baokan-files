According to information from the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau: Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian have been approved for arrest by the procuratorial authorities for the crime of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement. The public security authorities have issued a wanted notice.

Fang Lizhi (a researcher at the Beijing Astronomical Observatory of the Chinese Academy of Sciences) and Li Shuxian (a deputy professor at Peking University) have, before and after the turmoil and before the counter-revolutionary riot, used various means to continuously propagate and incite, and have also engaged in behind-the-scenes planning and liaison. After the counter-revolutionary riot occurred, Fang and Li fled into the U.S. Embassy to avoid punishment. On June 10, the Beijing Municipal People's Procuratorate Branch approved the arrest of Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian.

According to Article 30 of the "Organic Law of Local People's Congresses and Local People's Governments of the People's Republic of China," the Haidian District People's Congress Standing Committee has given permission for her arrest.
