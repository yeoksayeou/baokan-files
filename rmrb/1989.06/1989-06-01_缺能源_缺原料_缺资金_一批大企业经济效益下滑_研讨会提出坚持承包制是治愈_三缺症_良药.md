A batch of large enterprises (groups) in China are facing the "three deficiencies" (lack of energy, raw materials, and funds), with diminishing momentum and a worrisome future. A recent national symposium on large enterprises (groups) held in Shiyan proposed that the most effective remedy for the "three deficiencies" is to adhere to and improve the contract responsibility system.

It is understood that currently, state-owned enterprises, especially some large enterprises, are experiencing a rapid decline in economic performance. In the first quarter of this year, the realized profits of state-owned industrial enterprises within the budget decreased by 14%, and the losses of many enterprises further expanded. Datong Coal Mine, which accounts for 1/10 of the planned coal production, changed from a profit of 3.06 billion yuan in 1984 to a loss of 82.95 million yuan in 1988. The construction funding gap of Shengli Oil Field reached 500 million yuan, and the principal and interest to be repaid in 1989 amounted to 1.44 billion yuan, making it difficult for the oil field to purchase various materials. The profits of FAW Group from January to April decreased by 27.9% compared to the same period last year, and equipment renewal, transformation, and product development have been seriously affected. Many enterprise (group) leaders believe that a greater crisis will emerge in the coming period, and if not addressed promptly, the consequences will be severe.

In an interview with a reporter, Lu Dong, the president of the China Industrial Economic Association, pointed out that China has 2,908 large enterprises, accounting for only 0.24% of the total number of industrial enterprises, but their industrial output value accounts for about 30%. Large enterprises should be supported, and the practice of draining the pond to catch the fish is not advisable. He summarized the opinions of large enterprises (groups) and proposed suggestions to the central decision-making departments: First, the economic relationship between the state and enterprises should be based on improving the contract responsibility system. It is suggested that the state promptly drafts the contract plan for the "Eighth Five-Year Plan" period, so that large enterprises (groups) have a long-term development goal and technical transformation and development plans, and through the contract responsibility system, increase enterprise accumulation. Second, energy, raw materials, funds, and transportation should indeed be tilted towards large enterprises (groups). It is suggested to implement the method of fixed-point, fixed-quantity, and non-fixed-price for the materials needed by large enterprises (groups), and include them in the contract agreement for strict implementation. Third, with large enterprises as the base, various forms such as mergers, shareholding, and controlling shares should be adopted to promote the asset operation integration of enterprise groups, realize close-type specialized production and intensive operation, and give full play to the overall effectiveness of the group.

　　缺能源　缺原料　缺资金
    一批大企业经济效益下滑
    研讨会提出坚持承包制是治愈“三缺症”良药
    新华社北京６月１日电  （记者姚军）我国一批大企业（集团）受困于“三缺症”（缺能源、缺原材料、缺资金），后劲不足，前景堪忧。最近在十堰市举行的全国大企业（集团）研讨会提出，目前治愈“三缺症”比较有效的一帖药还是坚持实行和完善承包经营责任制。
    据了解，目前我国国营企业特别是一些大企业经济效益迅速下滑。今年一季度，预算内国营工业实现利润下降１４％，不少企业亏损额进一步扩大。占统配煤矿１／１０产量的大同煤矿由１９８４年盈利３．０６亿元变为１９８８年亏损８２９５万元。胜利油田建设资金缺口达５亿元，１９８９年贷款到期应偿还的本息为１４．４亿元，使油田无力购置各种器材。二汽１至４月份利润比去年同期下降了２７．９％，设备更新改造、产品开发研制已经受到严重影响。许多企业（集团）的负责人认为，更大的危机将在今后的一段时间表现出来，如不及早重视，后果是严重的。
    中国工业经济协会会长吕东在接受记者采访时认为，我国共有大企业２９０８个，仅占工业企业总数０．２４％，工业产值却占总数的３０％左右。大企业应当受到扶持，竭泽而渔的做法不足取。他综合大企业（集团）的意见，向中央决策部门提出建议：第一、国家与企业之间的经济关系应以完善承包经营责任制为主。建议国家及早拟定“八五”期间承包方案，以使大企业（集团）有一个长期发展目标和技术改造、开发计划，并通过承包经营责任制，提高企业积累。第二、能源、原材料、资金和交通运输，要确实向大企业（集团）倾斜。对大企业（集团）所需物资，建议实行定点定量不定价的办法，纳入合同协议严格执行。第三、以大企业为依托，采取兼并、参股、控股等多种形式，推进企业集团资产经营一体化，实现紧密型专业化生产、集约化经营，发挥集团整体效能。
