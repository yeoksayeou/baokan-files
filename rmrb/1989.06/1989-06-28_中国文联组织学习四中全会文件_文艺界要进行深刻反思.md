Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 28th.

The Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles (China Federation of Literary and Art Circles) organized a study of the documents from the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The literary and artistic circles need to conduct a deep reflection.

The chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles and members and committee members in Beijing held a symposium after studying the communiqué and related documents from the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee.

Wu Zuqiang, the executive vice-chairman of the Federation, said in his speech that the documents from the plenary session provided a profound analysis of the nature of the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, as well as a comprehensive explanation of the guidelines and policies for future work. In particular, Deng Xiaoping's far-sighted speech is a guiding document for improving the national consciousness and unifying thoughts. He hoped that literary and artistic circles across the country would seriously study these documents in the coming period, reflect on the past, think about the future, summarize experiences and lessons, and use them to guide future work.

Some speakers at the meeting pointed out that after the tumultuous struggle that began in mid-April, as Comrade Xiaoping said, the nature of this incident is the opposition between bourgeois liberalization and the Four Cardinal Principles. They believed that for the literary and artistic circles, it is particularly necessary to conduct a deep reflection on adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization. Old writer Kang Zhi, in connection with the literary situation, pointed out that in recent years, the literary and artistic circles have neglected spiritual civilization construction, and there has been some confusion in ideology. He said that under the influence of a certain way of thinking, there have been tendencies of irrationality, non-reality, non-sociality, and non-historicity in theory and creation. He hoped that the literary and artistic circles would have a clear direction when liberating their thoughts. The key is to have a clear guiding ideology and to constantly oppose bourgeois liberalization.

Liang Guangdi from the Propaganda Department's Literature Bureau said that since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, the literary and artistic circles have achieved great success, and the majority of comrades in the literary and artistic circles support the leadership of the Communist Party and socialism. However, there are indeed problems of bourgeois liberalization in the literary and artistic circles. Due to the encouragement and promotion of leaders like Zhao Ziyang, bourgeois liberalization has not only not been strongly opposed and resisted but has also spread rampantly. He said that under the guidance of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, the literary and artistic circles will definitely continue to adhere to the direction of serving the people and socialism, adhere to the Hundred Flowers and Hundred Schools of Thought policy, and resolutely, persistently, and in a policy-oriented manner oppose bourgeois liberalization, so that literature and art will bloom more brightly and diversely in the great cause of the Four Modernizations and reform and opening up.

Yang Liangcai from the Chinese Society for the Study of Contemporary Chinese Literature and Chen Changqian from the Photographic Artists Association spoke at the meeting, saying that in the past few years, the literary and artistic circles have not been able to thoroughly carry out the campaign to eliminate spiritual pollution and oppose bourgeois liberalization. For a time, the direction of serving the people and socialism was mentioned less, and the correct ideological content of the works was mentioned less, resulting in the emergence of some erroneous and chaotic things. In the future, we must study deeply and use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's series of speeches on opposing bourgeois liberalization to regulate our actions and thoughts.

Today's meeting was presided over by Liu Jianqing. Chairman of the China Federation of Literary and Art Circles Cao Yu made a written speech.

Others who spoke included Zhang Junqiu, Qi Gong, Zhang Ying, Jin Zhao, Yan Liangkun, Ge Weimo, and Su Yun (written speech).

　　中国文联组织学习四中全会文件    
    文艺界要进行深刻反思
    据新华社北京六月二十八日电  中国文联主席团成员和在京委员在学习了党的十三届四中全会公报和有关文件后，今天举行座谈。
    文联执行副主席吴祖强在发言中说，全会的各项文件对平息反革命暴乱性质的深刻分析，以及对今后工作方针、政策作的全面说明，特别是邓小平同志高瞻远瞩的讲话，是提高全国人民认识，统一思想的纲领性文件。他希望全国文艺界同志在今后一段时间内认真学习，并在此基础上回顾过去，思考未来，总结经验教训，以利于今后的工作。
    一些发言者在会上指出，在经历了四月中旬以来的这一场惊心动魄的斗争后，正如小平同志讲的，这次事件的性质是资产阶级自由化和四个坚持的对立。他们认为，对于文艺界来说，很有必要、也尤其要对坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化进行深刻的反思。老作家康濯联系文学状况指出，这几年文艺上忽视了精神文明建设，思想上存在着某种混乱。他说在一种思潮影响下，理论上、创作上出现了非理性化、非现实非社会化、非历史化的倾向。他希望文艺界在解放思想时要有一个方向。关键要有一个明确的指导思想，并经常地反对资产阶级自由化。
    中宣部文艺局梁光弟说，十一届三中全会以来，文艺上取得了很大成绩，文艺界大多数同志是拥护共产党领导、拥护社会主义的。但是文艺领域也的确存在着资产阶级自由化的问题。由于赵紫阳这样的领导人的怂恿和助长，资产阶级自由化不仅没有得到有力的反对和抵制，反而泛滥成灾。他说，在十三届四中全会精神指引下，文艺界一定会继续坚持文艺为人民服务、为社会主义服务的方向，坚持双百方针，切实地、长期不懈地而又是讲求政策地反对资产阶级自由化，使文艺在四化建设和改革开放的伟大事业中开放出更加鲜艳的、万紫千红的花朵。
    民研会的杨亮才、摄影家协会的陈昌谦在发言时谈到，前几年文艺界清除精神污染、反资产阶级自由化未能很好深入进行，一时间为人民服务、为社会主义服务的方向谈得少了，作品的正确思想内容谈得少了，以致一些错误的乌七八糟的东西产生了。今后一定要深入学习，要以邓小平同志关于反对资产阶级自由化的一系列讲话来规范我们的行动和思想。
    今天会议由刘剑青主持。中国文联主席曹禺作了书面发言。
    发言的还有张君秋、启功、张颖、金照、严良堃、葛维墨、苏云（书面）。
