Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, June 29th.

Harbin City in Heilongjiang Province has recently decided to abolish the privilege of free public transportation for personnel from relevant provincial and municipal departments.

In recent years, various departments in Harbin City have issued 16 different certificates allowing free rides on public buses and ferries within the city. These certificates have been issued by 11 departments, covering more than 20,000 individuals. During the rectification of public transportation order, the city's transportation department discovered that most certificate holders did not perform their management and inspection duties. Many people even transferred their certificates to friends and relatives for use, while some impersonated management personnel, causing ticket disputes. This not only damaged the image of government personnel but also affected the social and economic benefits of the public transportation enterprises.

It is understood that after canceling this free privilege, the city can sell an additional 4,000 yuan worth of tickets daily, amounting to an annual increase of 100 million yuan.

　　黑龙江省哈尔滨市作出新规定    
    政府人员不再免费乘公交车船    
    全年可增收百万元
    新华社哈尔滨６月２９日电（记者吴晓东、祖伯光）哈尔滨市最近决定取消省、市有关部门工作人员免费乘坐市内公交车船的待遇。
    近几年，在哈尔滨市内公共汽车、轮渡船只上，相继出现了省、市１１个部门自行核发的１６种免费乘坐车、船证件，免费乘客达２万多人。哈尔滨市交通部门在整顿公交运营秩序中发现，多数持证人员并不履行管理、检查的职责，不少人甚至将证件转让给亲友使用，还有一些人冒充管理人员，造成票务纠纷。这既损害了政府工作人员的形象，也影响了公交企业的社会效益和经济效益。
    据了解，哈尔滨市取消这项免费待遇后，每天多卖票款近４０００元，全年将可增收１００万元。
