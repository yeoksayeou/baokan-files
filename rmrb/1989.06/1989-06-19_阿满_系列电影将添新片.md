The longest series of films in China—the "A Man" series of comedies—will soon have a new addition. The 10th film in this series, "Big Fuss Over Nothing," recently began shooting in Nanchang.

The film is produced by the Guangxi Film Studio, with Zhang Gang, director of the Nanchang Film and Television Creation Research Institute, serving as the scriptwriter and director.

It is reported that all the films in the "A Man" series are written and directed by Zhang Gang. The first nine films are: "Worried and Happy," "The Husband's Secret," "The Playboy Chief," "The Loving Hat," "The Gentle Glasses," "Laughing and Crying," "The Little Big Old Man," "Men and Women Are Different," and "Laughing Tears."

In these series, Zhang Gang has successfully created a group of comedic characters who strive to improve their own value. The male leads in the films, although of different ages and professions, are all named A Man and are all kind, upright, and honest.

Like the previous nine films in the series, the male lead in "Big Fuss Over Nothing," Yang A Man, is also a "little person": a primary school teacher with over 20 years of teaching experience. He runs around trying to establish a school factory and repair school buildings, but encounters many obstacles and setbacks, leading to a story that is both lighthearted and slightly bitter.

### “阿满”系列电影将添新片

　　“阿满”系列电影将添新片
    新华社南昌电  （记者陈瑶）国内最长的系列电影——“阿满”系列喜剧故事片又将新添一个“阿满”。这一系列电影的第１０部影片《大惊小怪》日前在南昌开拍。
    这部影片由广西电影制片厂拍摄，南昌电影电视创作研究所所长张刚任编导。
    据悉，“阿满”系列片都是由张刚编剧、导演的。前９部是：《愁眉笑脸》、《丈夫的秘密》、《风流局长》、《多情的帽子》、《温柔的眼镜》、《哭笑不得》、《小大老传》、《男女有别》和《笑出来的眼泪》。
    张刚在这些系列片中较为成功地塑造了一群为提高自身价值而奋发向上的喜剧形象。影片的男主角年龄、职业虽各不相同，但都叫阿满，并且都很善良、正直、淳朴。
    同前９部系列片一样，《大惊小怪》的男主角杨阿满也是“小人物”：一个有２０多年教龄的小学教师。他为办校办工厂和修校舍而到处奔波，但却好事多磨、四处碰壁，由此引出一个既轻松又带点酸味儿的故事。
