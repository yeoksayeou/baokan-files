    The economic order in Qinghai is stable, and various industries are growing. According to a report from Xining on June 14th, from January to May this year, Qinghai completed an industrial total output value of 1.163 billion yuan, an increase of 6.7% compared to the same period last year. State-owned commercial stocks are abundant, and by the end of May, the savings balance reached 1.58 billion yuan.

    In response to the unrest in some students and minority groups in the Xining area in early May, the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee dispatched a large number of party and government leaders and people from various circles to deeply enter universities, factories, rural areas, and temples to strengthen guidance. They required public security police and traffic management departments to ensure traffic order. More than 3,000 cadres rushed to rural and pastoral areas to combat snow disasters and reduce losses, completing the sowing task of 5.86 million mu ahead of schedule, with a sowing area increased by about 100,000 mu compared to last year.
