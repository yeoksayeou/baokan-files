The renowned Japanese conductor Seiji Ozawa was born in Shenyang, China, in September 1935. He visited China for performances in 1976 and 1978. Ozawa studied at the Tokyo Toho Gakuen School of Music and later in Europe under Herbert von Karajan. He made his debut at New York's Carnegie Hall in 1961, creating a sensation. Since 1973, he has served as the music director and conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra.

Recently, a reporter from the *Boston Globe* interviewed Ozawa. Below is his account of his growth and views on music:

The life of a musician is abnormal. Music demands perfection, but of course, perfection does not exist. Music cultivates your emotions. Could I live without music?

Until I was 14, I had never been to a concert hall to listen to symphonic music. Before that, I only listened to music through phonographs or radio. Those sounds were pieced together.

When I listened to symphonic music in a concert hall, hearing so many sounds intertwined, I started to tremble all over. I was shocked by the sounds. This was a psychological turning point. Previously, I had always wanted to be a pianist. But at that moment, I realized I needed something more than the piano. I told myself: “I need symphonic music.”

Before this, I was foolish, always playing hockey. My mother didn’t allow me to play, and neither did my piano teacher.

Later, both of my hands were injured. It was after this injury that I listened to that symphonic music.

When I expressed my interest in conducting, people told me that was a Western thing. I thought about composing, but my heart was still on conducting. My mother remembered a relative who taught music notation, so she sent me to him.

Life is made up of a series of coincidences.

That relative made me his assistant. I taught other students and directed student orchestras. In fact, it was then that I learned conducting.

When I left Japan, I was an unknown. The question I faced was: Can an Easterner perform Western music? I was clear about this. This is why I worked so hard. I was more diligent than anyone else. If you are not a genius, to improve you must explore endlessly. I am not a genius.

At 27, I returned to Japan to lead the most famous NHK Symphony Orchestra. I got into the orchestra through many exams. Good fortune followed. I won several music awards.

Later, the orchestra members united to resist me. They said I was a tyrant, but I thought it was just a matter of my work methods being too strict. But the management sided with the members.

I felt confused and returned to the United States with a sense of having no way out.

If I had succeeded in Japan, perhaps I would have stayed there. I am a genuine Japanese.

For half a year, my wife and I sat together discussing the future of our children. They should know their roots. When we decided to let them return to Japan, we embraced and cried together. I had to stay here alone.

Music is a universal language. When you read an article, you must understand the meaning of the words, but when you listen to music, you don’t need to understand it. You just need to sit there, and the music will directly strike your heart.

However, you must listen with your heart. Music works through the listener’s experience and emotions. This is why different listeners have different feelings about the same piece of music.

　　“我不是天才”    
    ——小泽征尔答问录
    小泽征尔日本著名指挥家，１９３５年９月出生于中国沈阳，１９７６年和１９７８年曾两次来我国作访问演出。
    小泽征尔早年曾就读于东京桐明学园，后留学欧洲，师从卡拉扬，１９６１年首次登台纽约卡内基大厅，引起轰动。１９７３年起任波士顿交响乐团音乐指导兼终身指挥。
    最近，美国《波士顿环球报》记者采访了他，下面是他介绍自己成长的过程及对音乐的看法：
    音乐家的生活是不正常的。音乐要求尽善尽美，但是，当然不存在尽善尽美。音乐培育你的感情，没有音乐我能生活下去吗？
    直到１４岁那年，我才到音乐厅现场欣赏交响乐。以前我只是通过唱机或广播听音乐。那些声音是拼凑在一起的。
    当我在现场听交响乐，听到那么多声音交织在一起时，我开始浑身发抖，我被这声音震惊了。这是一次心理上的转折点。过去我一直想成为一名钢琴演奏家。但是此刻，我明白了自己有比钢琴更需要的东西。我对自己说：“我需要交响乐”。
    在这之前我很傻，一直玩曲棍球。母亲不让我玩，钢琴老师也不让我玩。
    后来，我的两只手负伤了。正是在双手负伤后，我听了那场交响乐。
    当我表示对指挥有兴趣时，人们告诉我，那是西方人的事。我想到作曲，但是我的心仍挂在指挥上。母亲想起自己有一位亲戚是教识谱的，便把我送到他那里。
    生活是由一系列巧合组成的。
    那位亲戚让我当他的助手。我教其他学生，并指导学生乐团。实际上，正是在那个时候我学习了指挥。
    我离开日本时是一个无名之辈。我面临的问题仍然是：一个东方人能演奏西方音乐吗？我清楚这一点。这正是我为什么特别刻苦的原因。我比任何人都更加刻苦。如果你不是天才，为了提高就得无止境地进行探索。我不是天才。
    ２７岁那年我回到日本领导最有名的日本广播公司乐团。我是通过许多考试才到该乐团的。幸运的事接踵而至。我获得了几次音乐奖。
    后来，乐团的团员联合起来抵制我。他们说我是一位暴君，而我想这只不过是工作方法过于严格的问题。但管理当局却站在团员一边。
    我感到困惑，便抱着走投无路的心情回到了美国。
    如果我在日本取得成功，也许我会留在那里。我是一个地道的日本人。
    有半年时间妻子和我坐在一起，商谈我们孩子的去向，他们应该知道自己的根。当我们决定让他们回到日本去时，我们在一起抱头痛哭。我只得一人留在这里。
    音乐是一种共同语言。阅读文章，你必须理解单词的意思，而听音乐，你不必听懂它。你只要坐在那里，音乐会直接敲打你的心扉。
    但是，你必须用你的心去倾听。音乐是通过听众的阅历和感情发挥作用的。这就是为什么同一首乐曲，不同的听众有不同感受的原因。
