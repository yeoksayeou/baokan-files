	Yang Shangkun, President of the People's Republic of China, met with a delegation from the Bolivian Congress led by Senate President Siro Humberto and House Speaker Walter Soriano in the Great Hall of the People this morning.

	Yang Shangkun briefed the guests on the recent situation in Beijing, where the government had suppressed a riot. He noted that international reactions varied, with some being friendly and others not. However, he emphasized that most Third World countries sympathized and understood China's position.

	Yang Shangkun pointed out that no ruling party or government would allow its power to be overthrown. As a sovereign nation, China has the full right to handle its internal affairs. He said that suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot was a matter of China's internal politics and was reasonable and justifiable.

	He reaffirmed that China will continue to follow its own path, which is to persist with reforms domestically and continue to open up to the outside world.

	Senate President Siro Humberto said that this visit to China was very valuable because the delegation members' personal experiences proved that the situation here was stable.

	He said that Bolivia has long adhered to the principle of "non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries." This principle also applies to China's current situation, meaning that foreign countries should not interfere in a country's decisions regarding its internal affairs. He said that Bolivia had experienced the hardships of foreign interference and therefore understood China's current situation very well.

	House Speaker Walter Soriano said that mutual support among developing countries is very important. Some countries interfering in China's internal affairs is not in the interest of the world's people.

	During the meeting, both sides expressed satisfaction with the development of bilateral relations and hoped to expand areas of bilateral cooperation and strengthen exchanges between the two countries' parliaments.

　　杨尚昆会见玻利维亚客人时强调    
    中国有充分权利处理内部事务
    新华社北京６月２９日电  国家主席杨尚昆今天上午在人民大会堂会见了由参议长西罗·洪堡和众议长瓦尔特·索里亚诺率领的玻利维亚国会代表团。
    杨尚昆向客人介绍中国政府最近平息北京的暴乱情况时说，对此国际反应有友好的，也有不友好的，但广大第三世界国家是同情和理解中国政府的。
    杨尚昆指出：任何一个执政党和政府都不会允许有人颠覆其政权。作为一个主权国家，中国有充分的权利处理国家的内部事务。他说，希望朋友们理解和明白，镇压反革命暴乱系中国内政，也是合情合理的。
    他重申：中国将继续走自己的路，即对内坚持改革，对外继续开放。
    西罗·洪堡参议长说，此次访华极有价值，因为代表团成员耳闻目睹的亲身经历证明，这里的局势是稳定的。
    他说：玻利维亚多年来一贯坚持“一个国家不干涉别国内政”的原则。这一原则现在也适用于中国的情况，那就是外国不应干涉一国对本国内部事务的决策。他说，玻利维亚曾经历外国干涉的磨难，因此十分理解中国目前的处境。
    瓦尔特·索里亚诺众议长说，发展中国家之间的相互支持非常重要。一些国家干涉中国内政是不符合世界人民利益的。
    会见时，宾主双方对两国关系的发展表示满意，并希望扩大双边合作领域，加强两国议会间的交流。
