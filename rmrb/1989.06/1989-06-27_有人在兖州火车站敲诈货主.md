On April 19, my father and I went to the northern cargo warehouse of Yanzhou Railway Station in Shandong to pick up goods. To save some money, we struggled to carry a sack of rice weighing over 100 kilograms from the warehouse to the station entrance. At that moment, six or seven men surrounded us. Without saying a word, they lifted the sack onto a handcart and started running towards the exit. My father and I were startled and quickly chased after them. This distance was only about 20 steps. The small-statured man holding the cart handle demanded 3 yuan from us. My father was furious and started arguing with them. A tall man came over, grabbed the cart handle with one hand, and pushed my father with the other, saying, “Pay up or take your rice away.” The other few men also joined in the commotion. As the argument escalated, the tall man punched my father. I was very angry, but seeing that we were outnumbered, I had to persuade my father to give them 3 yuan.

Soon, a public bus arrived, and these men immediately surrounded it. They took two cardboard boxes off the bus. An elderly passenger on the bus quickly asked, “What are you doing?” One of the tall men replied, “We’re loaders.” The elderly man said, “I haven’t reached my stop yet. Put them back on the bus.” The small-statured man smirked and said, “We’ll put them back, but you need to pay us 2 yuan. We can’t work for free.” The elderly man angrily said, “I didn’t ask you to do it!” The tall man stepped forward, hands on his hips, and said, “Pay up, or you won’t be going anywhere today.” At this point, the bus driver urged the elderly man to get on the bus. With no other choice, the elderly man took out 2 yuan and threw it at them, then struggled to put the two cardboard boxes back on the bus. Seeing the bus leave, these men laughed heartily.

I couldn’t understand: Why could these people openly extort goods owners at Yanzhou Railway Station?

　　有人在兖州火车站敲诈货主
    ４月１９日，我和父亲去山东兖州火车站北站货仓取货。为省点钱，我和父亲硬撑着把１００多公斤重的一袋大米从货仓抬到站门口，这时，围上来六七个汉子。他们二话没说，把麻袋抬到地排车上拉着就往门外跑。我和父亲吓了一跳，赶紧追到门外。这段路程不过２０步，扶车把的小个子伸手向我们要３元钱。父亲气急了，跟他们吵起来。一个大个子过来，一手抓住车把，一手推着我父亲说：“拿不拿钱？不拿钱把大米拉走。”其他几个人也跟着起哄。吵着吵着，大个子打了我父亲一拳，我很生气，但一看寡不敌众，只好劝父亲给他们３元钱。
    一会儿，一辆公共汽车开来，这几个人又马上围上去，上车把两个纸箱子抱了下来。车上的一个老大爷赶紧问道：“干什么？”一个大个子答：“装卸工。”老大爷说：“我还没有到站，你们给我抬上去。”一个小个子嘿嘿一笑说：“抬上去，拿两块钱来，我们白干吗？”老大爷生气地说：“我没有让你们干！”那个大个子过来一叉腰：“拿钱来，不然今天走不了。”这时，司机过来催老大爷上车。没办法，老大爷只好掏出两元钱扔给他们，自己又吃力地把两个纸箱子搬上车。几个家伙见汽车走了，哈哈大笑。
    我心中不解：这些人为什么能在兖州火车站公开敲诈货主？
