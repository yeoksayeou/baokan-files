West Berlin Mayor Visits Capital of East Germany

People's Daily, Berlin, June 20th. Reporter Xu Hongzhi reports: West Berlin Mayor Diepgen visited the capital of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) yesterday. GDR leader Honecker met with Diepgen and held a three-hour discussion on current international issues, relations between the two Germanys, and cooperation between the GDR government and the West Berlin city government.

This is Diepgen's first visit to the GDR capital since taking office as West Berlin Mayor.

Honecker and Diepgen emphasized the need to "respect the realities on German soil" and to "strictly adhere to and fully implement the Four-Power Agreement." Both sides agreed that Gorbachev's recent visit to West Germany has created conditions for improving the situation in Europe. They believe that a policy of peace and détente is the prerequisite for developing good neighborly relations.

Honecker supports the establishment of cooperation across the entire European continent, including West Berlin, and expressed that the GDR will participate in international activities in West Berlin that comply with the Four-Power Agreement.

Upon returning to West Berlin that day, Diepgen stated that in the future, direct dialogue and contact with GDR leaders will continue.

　　西柏林市长访问民德首都
    本报柏林６月２０日电  记者许宏治报道：西柏林市长蒙佩尔昨天到民主德国首都柏林进行访问。民德领导人昂纳克会见了蒙佩尔，同他就当前国际问题、两个德国的关系问题以及民德政府和西柏林市政府的合作问题等进行了３个小时的会谈。
    这是蒙佩尔就任西柏林市长以来第一次访问民德首都。
    昂纳克和蒙佩尔强调，应“尊重德国土地上存在的现实”，并“严格遵守和全面应用四方协定”。双方认为，戈尔巴乔夫最近对西德的访问为促进欧洲形势的改善创造了条件，和平与缓和政策是发展良好睦邻关系的前提。
    昂纳克赞成建立包括西柏林在内的整个欧洲的合作，并表示民德将参加在西柏林举行的符合四方协定的国际活动。
    蒙佩尔于当天回到西柏林后表示，今后要继续坚持与民德领导直接对话和接触。
