In February of this year, two new economic groups emerged in the Middle East and North Africa: the Arab Cooperation Council and the Arab Maghreb Union. This represents a new phase in the Arab countries' movement towards integration, which will significantly advance economic cooperation among Arab nations.

The Arab countries' economic cooperation is based on specific social foundations and objective conditions. The Arab nation, with a population of nearly 200 million spread across 22 countries, shares a common history, cultural traditions, customs, national sentiments, and religious beliefs. The desire for unity and strength has been a long-standing aspiration. Geographical proximity, uneven distribution of natural and human resources, and varying levels of economic development provide convenient connections and important prerequisites for mutual benefit and complementarity. Post-war, the common tasks of developing national economies, consolidating political independence, and enhancing international status have driven them to explore cooperative paths.

Over the past 40 years, as international relations have evolved, the scope of economic cooperation among Arab countries has made new progress in both depth and breadth. The content of this cooperation includes trade, finance, industrial and agricultural production, science and technology, education and training, transportation, information exchange, macroeconomic policies, and regional external economic relations. They emphasize broad cooperation and coordination of economic activities to achieve regional economic integration.

An important manifestation of economic cooperation among Arab countries is the establishment of common trade and financial institutions in the circulation sector. The Arab Common Market, established in 1964, aims to coordinate the trade policies of member countries, unify tariff rates, and promote the free flow of capital and labor among them. This common market has achieved some success, but its progress has been limited. More noteworthy are the numerous single-country and multi-country foundations and banks that emerged in the 1960s and 1970s, such as the Kuwait Arab Economic Development Fund, the Islamic Development Bank, and the Arab French Bank. These financial institutions play an active role in bilateral and multilateral loan assistance and financial cooperation, becoming an important part of international capital movements and significantly enhancing the Arab countries' position in the international financial arena.

Another prominent feature of economic cooperation among Arab countries is specialized cooperation and the establishment of exporting country organizations in the production sector. Organizations such as the Arab Iron and Steel Union, the Arab Agricultural Development Organization, the Arab Postal Union, the Arab Federation of Chambers of Commerce, Industry, and Agriculture, and the Arab Organization for Standardization and Metrology are all dedicated to promoting the development of Arab countries' production, technological exchange, information sharing, commercial exchanges, and helping to open up product markets. Particularly noteworthy is the Arab Oil Exporting Countries Organization, established in January 1968. Unlike OPEC, it does not focus primarily on oil prices but rather on coordinating the oil policies of Arab producing countries, strengthening technological exchange and training, providing capital and information, and cooperating in various sectors of the oil industry. To date, this organization has created favorable conditions for the comprehensive cooperation and development of its member countries in the oil industry.

It is worth noting that the higher level of economic cooperation among Arab countries is the establishment of economic unions and regional economic groups. The Arab Economic Unity Council, established in 1964 within the Arab League, marked an important beginning for Arab countries to work together towards integration. The Gulf Cooperation Council, born in the early 1980s under specific international conditions, has set an example for the economic grouping of Arab countries. Over the past eight years, it has shown strong vitality in various aspects.

However, cooperation is not always smooth. Due to differences in political systems, economic structures, and development levels, as well as conflicts of interest and historical legacies, the economic union of Arab countries has developed in a difficult and tortuous manner. Looking ahead, in the context of the current trend towards economic regionalization, facing the challenges of the U.S.-Canada Free Trade Area that emerged in January 1989, the European Common Market to be established in 1992, and the emerging East Asian economic circle, Arab countries will undoubtedly follow the historical trend and work together to build a prosperous and thriving Arab world.

　　地区经济一体化的新进展
    马秀卿
    今年２月，在西亚、北非地区出现了两个新的经济集团——阿拉伯合作委员会和阿拉伯马格里布联盟，这是阿拉伯国家一体化运动的新进展。将有力地推进阿拉伯国家之间的经济合作。
    阿拉伯国家的经济合作有其特定的社会基础和客观条件。分布在２２个国家近两亿人口的阿拉伯民族具有共同的历史遭遇、文化传统、风俗习惯、民族感情和宗教信仰，联合图强是长期以来的一致愿望。地域上的邻近，自然资源和人力资源分布的不均，以及经济发展水平的不一，为它们的合作提供了联系方便和互补互利的重要前提。战后，阿拉伯国家所面临的发展民族经济、巩固政治独立、提高国际地位的共同任务，则是促使它们开拓合作道路的动力。
    ４０多年来，随着国际关系的演变，阿拉伯国家经济合作的范围，在深度和广度上不断取得新的进展。合作的内容包括贸易、金融、工农业生产、科学技术、教育培训、交通运输、信息情报以及宏观经济政策、区域对外经济关系等许多方面。它们强调通过广泛合作，协调经济活动，争取实现区域经济一体化。
    阿拉伯国家经济合作的一个重要表现是，在流通领域建立共同的贸易机构和金融机构。１９６４年组成的阿拉伯共同市场，旨在协调成员国的贸易政策，统一关税率，并促使彼此间资金和劳力的自由流动。该共同市场曾取得一定成效，但后来进展不大。更引人注目的是，在六、七十年代各种单国的和多国的基金会及银行机构大批涌现，如科威特阿拉伯经济发展基金会、伊斯兰发展银行、阿拉伯法国银行等等。这些金融机构在双边和多边的贷款援助和资金融通的合作活动中发挥着积极的作用，成为国际资本运动中的重要组成部分，大大地增强了阿拉伯国家在国际金融领域的地位。
    阿拉伯国家经济合作的又一突出表现是，在生产领域进行专项合作和建立输出国组织。如阿拉伯钢铁联合会、阿拉伯农业发展组织、阿拉伯邮政同盟、阿拉伯各国农工商会总联盟、阿拉伯标准化和度量衡组织等都致力于促进阿拉伯国家的生产发展、技术交流、情报沟通、商业往来，并帮助开拓产品销售市场。尤其值得注意的是１９６８年１月成立的阿拉伯石油输出国组织，它不同于世界范围的欧佩克，没把主要注意力集中在油价问题上，而是放在协调阿拉伯产油国的石油政策，加强技术交流和训练，提供资本和信息，在石油工业各个部门进行合作经营上。迄今为止，该组织已为成员国在石油工业领域的全面合作和发展创造了优越的条件。
    应当特别指出，阿拉伯国家经济合作更高层次的表现是经济联盟和区域性经济集团的建立。１９６４年在阿拉伯国家联盟中正式成立了阿拉伯经济统一委员会，这是阿拉伯国家协力实现一体化的重要开端。在８０年代初期特定的国际环境下诞生的海湾合作委员会，为阿拉伯国家的经济集团化树立了榜样。８年多来，它在各方面都显示了强大的生命力。
    但是合作并不是一帆风顺的。由于各国政治体制、经济结构和发展水平的差别，切身利益的分歧，以及存在某些历史上遗留下来的矛盾，阿拉伯国家之间的经济联合是在艰难曲折中发展的。展望前程，在当今世界经济区域化发展趋势的大潮中，面对着１９８９年１月出现的美加自由贸易区、将在１９９２年建立的欧洲共同体大市场和正在形成中的东亚经济圈的严峻挑战，阿拉伯各国必定会顺应历史潮流，同建繁荣昌盛的阿拉伯世界。
