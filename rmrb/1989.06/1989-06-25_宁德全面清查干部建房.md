Ningde Conducts Comprehensive Investigation of Officials' Housing Construction

FUZHOU, June 25 (Xinhua) — In a situation where the general public faces housing shortages, some officials in the eastern part of Fujian Province have private homes while occupying public housing, or build private homes while living in public housing, and even construct private homes for rent. After addressing issues of illegal land use and construction in a previous phase, the Ningde region initiated a comprehensive investigation of these problems starting in April. The county of Fuan publicly listed 146 households that reported living in public housing while building private homes, inviting public supervision. Currently, 112 cases of illegal and disciplinary violations in county-level departments have been investigated, with fines totaling 150,000 yuan imposed. Three individuals with serious offenses have been subjected to case reviews.

　　宁德全面清查干部建房
    本报福州６月２５日电  记者张铭清报道：在群众住房紧张的情况下，闽东一些干部家有私房占公房，或住着公房建私房，甚至盖起私房搞出租。宁德地区在前一段处理违法违纪占地盖房问题后，从４月开始全面清查这类问题。福安县把自报住着公房建私房的１４６户张榜公布，请群众监督。目前，县直机关１１２户违法违纪者已被查处，被罚款１５万元，３名情节严重的已被立案审查。
