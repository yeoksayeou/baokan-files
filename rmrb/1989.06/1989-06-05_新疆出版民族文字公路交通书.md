A Kazakh worker exclaimed "Jiakes! Jiakes!" (Good! Good!) when he first saw the Kazakh version of "Examination Questions and Answers for Road Maintenance Workers." This book is one of the recent publications by the Xinjiang Ethnic Script Translation Department of the People's Traffic Press. So far, the department has compiled and translated 62 road traffic books and textbooks in Uyghur and Kazakh scripts, with a circulation of over 290,000 copies.

The vast region of Xinjiang places significant importance on road traffic. However, the 18,000-plus ethnic minority technical personnel and workers on this frontline lacked professional books in their native languages, which hindered the improvement of their professional skills. Additionally, evening universities, radio and TV universities, and vocational schools in the traffic industry were also in need of textbooks in ethnic minority languages.

　　新疆出版民族文字公路交通书
    新华社乌鲁木齐６月４日电  （通讯员张先凤）当一位哈萨克族工人第一次见到哈萨克文的《养路工人考试试题解答选编》一书时，连呼“佳克斯！（好）佳克斯！”这本书是人民交通出版社新疆民族文字编译部近期出版发行的。到目前，这个编译部已编译维吾尔文和哈萨克文的公路交通图书、教材６２种，发行量达２９万多册。
    广袤的新疆，公路交通占有重要的地位，但工作在这条战线上的１．８万多名少数民族科技人员和工人，却没有一本少数民族文字的业务书籍，不利于提高他们业务技术水平，交通行业的业余大学、电大、中专等学校也缺乏少数民族文字的教材。
