The Security Council urges the two communities in Cyprus to cooperate with the Secretary-General to resolve the Cyprus issue

United Nations, June 9 (Reported by Liu Kai Chen) The Security Council of the United Nations urged the Greek and Turkish communities in Cyprus to cooperate with the Secretary-General to achieve substantial progress in the comprehensive resolution of the Cyprus issue.

This appeal was made in a statement issued by Thomas Pickering, the President of the Security Council for this month, after a consultation meeting of the Council. He said that Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar plans to host direct talks between the two sides in Cyprus by the end of this month and hopes that these talks will yield positive results. The members of the Security Council all expressed their support for this.

The Security Council welcomed the recent measures taken by the two communities in Cyprus to withdraw military personnel from military outposts and urged both sides to consider taking further steps to reduce tensions, avoid conflict incidents, demonstrate goodwill, and create a favorable atmosphere for a just and lasting resolution of the Cyprus issue.

The Security Council also unanimously adopted a resolution today to extend the stay of the United Nations Peacekeeping Force in Cyprus for another six months until December 15 this year.

    本报联合国６月９日电  记者刘开宸报道：联合国安理会全体理事国呼吁塞浦路斯的塞族和土族双方与联合国秘书长合作，以便在塞浦路斯问题的全面解决方面取得实质性进展。
    这项呼吁是安理会本月主席托马斯·皮克林在安理会磋商会后发表的一项声明中提出的。他说，秘书长德奎利亚尔打算在本月底主持塞浦路斯双方的直接会谈，并希望此会谈取得积极成果，安理会理事国都对此表示支持。
    安理会全体理事国欢迎塞浦路斯两族最近采取撤走军事据点内军事人员的措施，并敦促双方考虑采取进一步措施，以便减少紧张、避免发生冲突事件、显示善意，为塞浦路斯问题的公正和持久解决创造良好气氛。
    安理会今天还一致通过一项决议，将联合国维持和平部队留驻塞浦路斯期限再延长６个月，直到今年１２月１５日。
