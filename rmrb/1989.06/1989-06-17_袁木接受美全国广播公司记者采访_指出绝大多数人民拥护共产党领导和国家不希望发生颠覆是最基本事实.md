Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 17th.

Yuan Mu, spokesman for the State Council, accepted an interview with Tom Brokaw, host of the National Broadcasting Company (NBC) program, at the International Club yesterday afternoon. The interview lasted about 45 minutes, with some Chinese and foreign journalists present as listeners.

Q: Mr. Yuan Mu, thank you for accepting my interview. The whole world is very eager to know the truth about the Tiananmen incident. Was it Chairman Deng Xiaoping who ordered the troops to advance?

A: The People's Liberation Army entered Tiananmen Square to carry out the martial law mission and to maintain order in the capital. During the clearance of Tiananmen Square, no one was killed, and no one was run over by military vehicles. The foreign media's claim of a "massacre" in Tiananmen Square, with so many people killed, is incorrect. The students who occupied Tiananmen Square left in an orderly manner, waving flags, or withdrew voluntarily.

Q: In your statement, I found something shocking. This is, our footage several hundred feet long can show: workers, students were shot to death, and innocent bystanders were also shot to death. Not only reporters from our Western countries, but also some observers from neutral countries, people around the world including Chinese people saw people standing at a very close distance being shot by the People's Liberation Army. How can you say that you and the central leaders do not believe that anyone was injured?

A: I did not say that there were no casualties in the entire suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot. I only said that the People's Liberation Army did not kill anyone during the clearance of Tiananmen Square. As for the entire suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot, some criminals were killed, and some bystanders who were watching also suffered misinjuries. The People's Liberation Army itself also suffered heavy casualties. Regarding the casualty situation, I have already announced it on behalf of the State Council at a press conference held earlier. In this incident, the People's Liberation Army had more than 5,000 injured, and more than 2,000 bystanders and criminals were injured. The number of deaths is roughly 300, including the People's Liberation Army, criminals, and a few bystanders.

Some foreign reports say that China killed tens of thousands of people in the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot, even tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of people, which is not accurate and is a distortion and exaggeration. I think an important reason why some foreign reports are incorrect is that they have not understood the nature of the recent events in Beijing. This incident was a counter-revolutionary riot instigated by a small number of people who wanted to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system. The People's Liberation Army suppressed the riot. In the process of suppression, because good and bad people were mixed together, the People's Liberation Army adopted a tolerant and restrained attitude. When they entered the city, they did not open fire because they were afraid of injuring the people, so the casualties of the People's Liberation Army were particularly heavy. If the People's Liberation Army had opened fire as soon as they entered the city, they would not have suffered such heavy casualties, and their weapons would not have been seized by the criminals in such large numbers. Our military vehicles and tanks would not have been burned to hundreds of vehicles. This is within the scope of common sense. Of course, in the process of suppressing the criminals, because there were many bystanders, some people were also misinjured. We also feel uneasy about this. First of all, we should express our deep sorrow for the martyrs of the People's Liberation Army who sacrificed their lives in the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot. They made a contribution to the people and to the defense of our People's Republic.

I also believe that in any sovereign country in the world, when a part of the people in that country wants to overthrow their country, the government of that country suppresses these people. This is entirely within the sovereignty of that country and is an internal affair of that country. No other country has the right to interfere.

Q: Mr. Yuan Mu, although I respect you, I still want to question the premises you have put forward. First of all, many foreign observers, including well-trained Western reporters, have seen hundreds, even thousands of young students and innocent bystanders being killed and injured. Of course, they also saw some soldiers being injured, but the number is far less than that of the demonstrators. In addition, you said that the demonstrations were instigated by a few hooligans and criminals. Do you think this is an insult to the hundreds of millions of Chinese people? Because in the past period, hundreds of thousands of teachers, shop clerks, workers, and even reporters have participated in demonstrations, demanding more democracy and reducing corruption in the leadership.

A: First of all, I want to correct your concept. I have been talking about our suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot. We have always regarded the demonstrations of some students since mid-April as follows: First, their wishes to have the Party and the government rectify corruption, rectify official profiteering, promote democracy, and deepen reforms are good and consistent with the goals of the Party and the government. However, the student movement was utilized by the bad people who were hiding behind the scenes to instigate turmoil and even counter-revolutionary riots. We have never regarded the vast majority of students as criminals, but there were indeed some criminals mixed among the students. This is a fact. As for the hundreds, even thousands, or more people you mentioned who were killed, I have already given you a relatively accurate number. I hope you do not believe those exaggerated claims.

We do not approve of the way students hold demonstrations. Because we have legal regulations on demonstrations. Our Constitution grants citizens the right to march and demonstrate, but at the same time, in order to ensure that the freedom and rights of others are not infringed upon by demonstrators, and to maintain traffic order, we also have regulatory provisions for demonstrations. The Standing Committee of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress has such regulations. We do not approve of students not following these regulations.

The most important point is that the extremely small number of counter-revolutionary rioters mixed in the student demonstration queues have already put forward the program and slogans to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and to subvert the People's Republic of socialism. This is their purpose to achieve the riot, and we will never allow this purpose to succeed. This is completely different from the demands that students put forward in the early stages of the student movement, such as the "democracy" and "freedom" you mentioned.

Q: You have now designated a counter-revolutionary, that is, a traitor to the Chinese nation, as the famous dissident Fang Lizhi. He is now protected by the U.S. Embassy. Will you storm the embassy to arrest him?

A: Our public security organs have issued a warrant for Fang Lizhi. He has violated Chinese criminal law and is guilty of inciting counter-revolution. We know that he has taken refuge in the U.S. Embassy. We are closely watching the development of this situation. We hope the U.S. government will handle this matter prudently.

Q: Do you think Fang Lizhi will be sent to a neutral third country?

A: I have already said that I hope the U.S. government will handle this matter prudently. Our public security organs have issued a warrant for Fang Lizhi, and we will arrest him.

Q: Do you think he will be tried in China, and even sentenced to death?

A: If arrested, he will be punished according to law, and the sentence will be determined according to the law.

Q: Mr. Yuan Mu, how is the leadership of China now? Has Comrade Zhao Ziyang been removed from his position as General Secretary? Do you have a new General Secretary now?

A: Recently, Chairman Deng Xiaoping's reception of the military leaders above the corps level of the capital's martial law troops has announced to the world the stability of China's leadership. As far as I know, there are a few individuals in the highest level of the Communist Party of China who have made the mistake of supporting the turmoil. His problem will be dealt with and made public soon. The problems within the leadership of the Communist Party will be handled according to the procedures stipulated in the Party Constitution.

Q: Will some leaders, including Zhao Ziyang, be tried?

A: I said that the problem of a few individuals in the Party's highest leadership is an internal Party matter and will be handled according to the Party Constitution.

Q: If American businessmen and other Western businessmen realize that China is controlled by a fully armed army, how can you expect them to return to China after experiencing this spring's turmoil?

A: I think they will understand the facts. The Chinese government is now stably controlling the situation throughout the country. In the capital, only some areas are under martial law. The martial law we are talking about is to implement special security measures for some key departments, which is not the same concept as military control. This is completely different from the entire country being under military control, and other places are not under martial law, except for Lhasa because of the recent disturbances caused by a few separatist elements.

I would like to convey a message to American businessmen and the business community here: China will continue to adhere to the direction of reform and opening up. Chairman Deng Xiaoping said in a recent speech that China is not too open now, but rather not open enough, and we will continue to reform and open up in the future. Of course, we will adhere to reform and opening up on the premise of adhering to the socialist road. Our policy of reform and opening up will not change. We welcome American friends who have been cooperating with China in economic and trade activities to come back quickly, and we also welcome more American businessmen to come to China to do business, invest, and set up enterprises.

Q: Please allow me to ask one more question. How can you make Western businessmen believe your guarantee: China will continue to open up to the West? You know, you have always been saying that the casualties in Tiananmen Square are small, and the casualties of soldiers are greater than those of civilians; the demonstrators were only instigated by a few hooligans and criminals. You know, there is now a lot of evidence to prove the opposite. Will China lose its credibility in the world?

A: I think, after eliminating the rumors, both domestic and foreign, that distort the facts, the world will understand the truth about what happened in China. China's adherence to the policy of reform and opening up will be trusted by the vast majority of countries in the world, including the business community and the business community. The Chinese market is still attractive. After they understand the facts, they will increase their investment in China. Moreover, there is a fact that can be said to illustrate this, that is, during the period of the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital, it was not that all foreign businessmen who conducted various business and trade activities, investment activities in China left, but also a considerable number of people did not leave, and they said that as long as the safety in China can be guaranteed, various business activities can be carried out normally, and their business will not be suspended. I think those who left in a hurry will regret it one day, of course, it is not too late to come back now.

I would like to add a few more words: The Chinese government's position and attitude have always been to distinguish between the vast majority of students who participated in the demonstrations, although their methods were wrong, and the extremely few bad people who utilized the student movement to instigate turmoil and even counter-revolutionary riots. The government will pay full attention to the reasonable demands raised by students in the student movement. I have repeatedly announced on behalf of the State Council that after the situation stabilizes, we will still dialogue with students and people from all walks of life, listen to their opinions, adopt their reasonable criticisms and suggestions, and improve the work of the Party and the government.

Q: China has already sentenced three people to death in Shanghai, and they are accused of being hooligans and thugs. Will there be more such people sentenced to death in the next few days?

A: The people sentenced to death in Shanghai are because they disrupted traffic and set fire to trains, and they are extremely heinous criminals. I think in the future there will still be a few (but not many) people who committed such extremely heinous crimes and will receive the punishment they deserve. For example, throwing a soldier of the People's Liberation Army from an overpass to the road below, killing him, then pouring gasoline on him while he is not completely dead, burning him to death, and then hanging the corpse in the market. For such extremely brutal criminals, if they are not punished, the people will not agree.

I would like to say a few more words at the end. I hope to convey a message to the American audience, listeners, and the audience and listeners of the world through you: The current socialist People's Republic of China is led by the Communist Party of China, with hundreds of millions of people fighting and sacrificing more than 20 million people to win it with their blood. The vast majority of the Chinese people support the leadership of the Communist Party and the country and do not want to be overthrown. This is the most basic fact. Anyone who wants to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist People's Republic of China will never achieve their sinister goal.

For our just actions to suppress the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital, we hope to receive the understanding of the governments and peoples of various countries in the world. We also want to announce to the world: We will continue to adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and develop friendly relations with all countries in the world. This is our unshakable and unchanging basic state policy.

Q: There are 40,000 Chinese students in the United States now. Do you hope they will all return to China? You know, in the United States, these people tell reporters and others who want to hear their words that they hope to stay in the United States.

A: I believe that the vast majority of Chinese students will return to their motherland to serve their country. Of course, I do not rule out that some people do not want to come back. I express my regret for this. From my own point of view, I sincerely hope they will come back, and I believe they will come back.

Q: Will you expel more foreign journalists?

A: As long as journalists take a fair and objective attitude towards reporting the situation in our country, do not violate our martial law, abide by Chinese laws, and conduct normal interviews, their legitimate interview rights will be respected and protected by the Chinese government, just like your interview rights are protected and respected.

Finally, Brokaw repeated his second question and changed the sentence from "several hundred feet of footage showing students and bystanders being shot" to "several miles of footage."

Yuan Mu said: Modern technology development has provided some people with the possibility of making even longer footage to distort the facts. Thank you for your interview!

　　袁木接受美全国广播公司记者采访
    指出绝大多数人民拥护共产党领导和国家不希望发生颠覆是最基本事实　
    新华社北京６月１７日电  国务院发言人袁木昨天下午在国际俱乐部接受了美国全国广播公司节目主持人汤姆·布罗考的电视采访。
    采访进行了４５分钟左右。一些中外记者旁听了采访。
    问：袁木先生，谢谢您接受我的采访。现在整个世界都非常想了解天安门事件的真相，请问是邓小平主席下令进军的吗？
    答：解放军进驻天安门广场是执行戒严任务，为了维护首都的秩序。在对天安门广场的清理中，没有发生任何的伤亡，没有打死一个人，解放军的军车也没有轧死一个人。现在国外舆论中有所谓血洗天安门，轧死多少多少人这样的说法，这是不正确的。当时占领天安门广场的学生是排着队、打着旗和平撤离的，或者说自动撤离的。
    问：我在您所讲的这番话中发现一些令我震惊的东西，这就是，我们几百尺长的胶片，可以表明：工人、学生被枪杀，无辜的旁观者也遭到枪杀，而且不但是来自我们西方国家的记者，还有一些中立国家的观察家，整个世界的人民包括中国人都看到人们站在很近的距离被解放军枪杀了。您怎么能够说，您和中央领导人却不相信有人受伤呢？
    答：我没有说在整个镇压反革命暴乱事件中没有发生伤亡。我刚才只是说，解放军在清理天安门广场过程中没有发生打死人的事情。至于在整个镇压反革命暴乱过程中，有一些歹徒被打死，也有一部分看热闹、围观的群众遭到误伤，解放军本身也遭到很大伤亡。关于这个伤亡的情况，我已经在前不久举行的记者招待会上代表国务院宣布过了。在这个事件中，解放军有５０００多人受伤，围观的群众和歹徒受伤的有２０００多人。死亡的数字大体上３００人，包括解放军，以及歹徒和少数围观的群众。
    现在有些国外的报道说中国在镇压反革命暴乱的过程中，有成千上万的人死亡，甚至说多少万多少万人死亡，是不确切的，是歪曲、夸大的。我觉得国外有些报道之所以不正确，重要的一个原因，是他们对前不久在北京发生的事情的性质没有弄清楚。这件事情是一小撮要推翻共产党的领导，推翻社会主义制度的暴徒策动的一场反革命暴乱，人民解放军是镇压暴乱。在镇压的过程中，由于好人坏人混在一起，解放军采取了容忍的、克制的态度。在一进城的时候，并没有开枪，因为怕误伤群众，所以解放军的伤亡特别大。如果解放军一进城就开枪，他们不会有这么大的伤亡，他们的武器就不会被歹徒抢走那么多，我们的军车、坦克也不会被烧毁几百辆，这是常识范围内的事。当然，在镇压暴徒的过程中，由于围观的群众较多，也误伤了一些人，对这一点我们也感到不安。首先，我们要对在镇压反革命暴乱中牺牲的人民解放军烈士表示沉痛的哀悼，他们为人民，为捍卫我们的人民共和国立了功。
    我还认为，在世界上任何一个主权国家，当这个国家有一部分人要颠覆他们的国家时，这个国家的政府对这些人实行镇压，这完全是这个国家主权范围内的事，是这个国家的内政，任何国家都无权干涉。
    问：袁木先生，尽管我对您很尊重，但我还是想对您所提出的这些前提表示质疑。首先，许多外国的观察家，包括训练有素的西方记者，他们都看到成百乃至成千的年轻学生和无辜的旁观者被杀被伤。当然，他们也看到一些士兵受到伤亡，但其数量远远比不上示威游行者。此外，您刚才说，示威游行是由少数流氓和歹徒挑动起来的，那么您认为这是不是对中国千百万人民的侮辱呢？因为过去这段时间，成百万的教师、商店的售货员、工人，甚至记者都参加了示威游行，他们要求更多的民主，要求减少领导层中的腐败现象。
    答：首先我要纠正你的一个概念，我一直在讲我们镇压的是反革命暴乱。我们对从４月中旬开始的一部分学生的示威游行从来是这样看的：第一，他们在学潮中提出希望党和政府整治腐败、整治官倒、推进民主、深化改革这样的愿望是好的，是同党和政府的目标一致的。但是，学潮被躲在背后策动动乱以至于反革命暴乱的坏人所利用了。我们从来不认为广大学生是暴徒，但是也有一部分暴徒混在学生中间，这是事实。至于你刚才说到，成千成百甚至于更多的人死亡，我已经跟你说了接近实际的比较准确的数字，我希望你不要听信那些夸大的说法。
    学生进行示威游行，这样的方式我们也不赞成，因为我们对于示威游行有法律的规定。我国宪法赋予公民游行示威的权利，同时，为了使别人的自由权利不受到示威游行的人的妨碍，交通秩序得到维持，我们也有对示威游行的法规性的管理条例，北京市人大常委会就有这样的规定。学生不遵守这样的规定，我们是不赞成的。
    最重要的一点是，混在学生游行示威队伍中的极少数反革命暴徒，他们已经提出了要推翻共产党的领导、要颠覆社会主义人民共和国的纲领和口号，这是他们要达到的实现暴乱的目的，对这种目的，我们是绝不能让它得逞的。这同学生在学潮初期提出的某些要求，比如你所说的多一点“民主”和“自由”，完全是根本不同的两回事。
    问：你们现在定下了一个反革命分子，也就是说中华民族的叛徒，那就是著名的执不同政见者方励之先生，他现在已经由美国大使馆给予了庇护。那么，你们是否准备冲进大使馆将他抓起来。
    答：我们的公安部门已经对方励之发出了通缉令，他触犯了中国的刑律，犯的是反革命煽动罪。我们知道他已经躲进了美国大使馆，我们密切地注视这个事态的发展，我们希望美国政府慎重地处理这个问题。
    问：您认为，方励之是否会送到一个中立的第三国呢？
    答：我刚才已经说了，希望美国政府慎重处理此事。我国公安机关已对方励之发出了通缉令，我们是要将他缉拿归案的。
    问：您认为，他在中国有可能被进行审讯，甚至判处死刑吗？
    答：如果缉拿归案，我们将依法惩处，将依据法律来量刑。
    问：袁木先生，现在中国的领导层怎么样呢？赵紫阳先生是不是被撤掉了总书记的职务？你们现在有新的总书记吗？　　
    答：前不久，邓小平主席接见首都戒严部队军以上领导干部这件事，就向全世界宣告了中国领导层的稳定。据我所知，在中国共产党的最高层中确有个别人犯了支持动乱的错误。关于他的问题不久将得到处理，公诸于世。中国共产党领导层内部的问题，将按照中国共产党章程规定的程序进行处理。
    问：一些领导人甚至包括赵紫阳是否会遭到审讯呢？
    答：我说了，党的最高领导层个别人的问题是党内问题，将按党的章程进行处理。
    问：如果美国商人和其他西方的商人认识到中国是在被全副武装的军队所控制着，那么你们怎么能够希望他们在经历了这个春天的动乱后会回到中国呢？
    答：我想他们会了解事实真相的。中国现在的政府稳定地控制着全国的局势。在首都，也只是部分地区实行戒严。我们所说的戒严，是指对一些要害部门，实行特殊的警戒，跟军管不是一个概念，这和整个国家都实行军事管制更是完全不同的两码事，而且其他地方也没有戒严，除了拉萨因为前一段时间发生了少数分裂主义分子的骚乱以外。
    我在这里请你给美国的企业家、工商界人士带去一个信息：中国坚持改革、开放的方向绝不变。邓小平主席在前不久的讲话中说，现在中国不是开放过头了，而是开放还不够，今后我们还要继续改革、开放。当然，我们要在坚持社会主义道路的前提下坚持改革、开放，我们改革、开放的方针不变。我们欢迎原来就在中国和中国方面进行经济合作、贸易往来的美国朋友回去的快回来，我们还欢迎更多的美国商人来中国作买卖、投资、办企业。
    问：请允许再问一个问题。您们怎么能够使得西方的商人相信您的保证：中国将继续向西方开放？要知道，您们一直在说：在天安门广场伤亡很小，而且士兵的伤亡大于平民的伤亡；示威游行者只不过是由少数的流氓、歹徒挑起的。您们要知道，现在有许多证据证明的情况与此恰恰相反。中国是否会在世界上失去她的信誉呢？
    答：我想，排除了国外、也包括我们国内某些歪曲的谣言，世界明白了中国发生的事情的真相，中国坚持实行改革、开放的政策是会得到全世界绝大多数国家包括企业界、工商界的信任的。中国这个市场还是有吸引力的。他们在明白了事实真相后，是会扩大对华投资的。而且还有一个事实可以说明，就是在首都发生反革命暴乱期间，也并不是所有的在华进行各种工商企业贸易、投资活动的外国商人都走了，也有相当一部分人没有走，而且他们表示，在中国安全能够得到保证，各种业务活动能够正常进行，并没有使得他们的业务停顿。我想那些匆匆忙忙走了的人，总有一天也会后悔的，当然现在回来也不晚。
    再说一句：中国政府的立场和态度从来是把参加游行示威的广大学生，尽管他们的方式不对，同利用学潮、策动动乱以至反革命暴乱的极少数坏人区分开来。对学生在学潮中提出的一些合理要求，政府将加以充分重视。我曾一再代表国务院宣布过，在局势稳定之后，我们还将同学生对话，同社会各界人士对话，听取他们的意见，采纳他们合理的批评和建议，改进党和政府的工作。
    问：中国已在上海判处了３个人的死刑，他们被指控是流氓、地痞。那么，今后几天是否会有更多这样的人被判处死刑？
    答：在上海被判处死刑的人是由于他们破坏交通，放火烧毁火车，是罪大恶极的罪犯。我想，今后还会有极少数（但不会是很多）犯有这类罪大恶极罪行的人受到应有惩处。比如说，把解放军战士从过街天桥扔到马路上活活摔死，又在他还没完全死的时候浇上汽油，焚烧而死，再把尸体挂起来，暴尸于市。对这样极端凶残的暴徒，如果不惩处，人民是不会答应的。
    我还想最后说两句，我希望通过你向美国观众、听众以至于世界的观众、听众捎一个信息：现在的社会主义的中华人民共和国，是中国共产党领导亿万人民浴血奋战，牺牲了两千多万人，用鲜血换来的。中国的绝大多数人民拥护共产党的领导，拥护这个国家，不希望发生颠覆，这是最基本的事实。谁要想颠覆中国共产党的领导、颠覆社会主义中华人民共和国，这样的阴谋目的是永远达不到的。
    对于我们在首都镇压反革命暴乱的正义行动，我们希望得到世界各国政府和人民的理解。我们也要向世界宣布：我们将永远坚持在和平共处五项原则的基础上，同世界各国继续发展友好关系。这也是我们坚定不移、不会改变的基本国策。
    问：现在在美国有４万名中国留学生，您希望他们都能够回国吗？要知道，在美国，这些人对记者和别的想听他们讲话的人都说，他们希望留在美国。
    答：我相信，绝大多数中国留学生是会回到祖国为自己的国家服务的。当然，我也不排除一些人不愿意回来。对此，我表示遗憾。从我自己来讲，我衷心地希望他们回来，也相信他们会回来。
    问：你们是否会驱赶更多的外国记者呢？
    答：只要采取公正、客观的态度报道我国的情况，不违反我们的戒严令，遵守中国的法律，进行正常采访的记者先生、女士们，他们的正当采访权利都会受到中国政府的尊重、保护。正像你的采访权利受到保护和尊重一样。
    最后，布罗考重复他的第二个问题，并将问题中原说的有几百英尺录相带表明学生和围观者被枪杀一句改为有几英里长的录相带。
    袁木说：现代技术的发展，为有的人提供了这样的可能，他们可以搞出比你说的更长的录相带来歪曲事实真相。谢谢你对我的采访！
