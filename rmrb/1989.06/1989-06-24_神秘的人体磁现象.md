In recent years, scientists have observed that human organs can emit magnetic sounds. Moreover, the "tone" of the magnetic sounds from healthy individuals differs from those with injuries. Researchers can understand the brain's working condition by listening to brain magnetic sounds.

The magnetic field strength on the Earth's surface is 0.5 Oersted. People have become accustomed to living in such a magnetic field. When the direction and strength of the geomagnetic field undergo irregular changes (such as magnetic storms), the mortality rate and the incidence of certain diseases in some regions will significantly increase. A decrease in geomagnetic field strength will slow down human growth. The total magnetic field strength in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, is the lowest, and children there are shorter than their American counterparts of the same age. In Rwanda, Africa, the total magnetic field strength is the highest, and the Tutsis there are taller than European men. Precise experiments have shown that the brain, lungs, and heart of the human body all emit weak magnetic fields. When a heart attack occurs, the magnetic field emitted by the heart will change. This can be diagnosed using a heart magnetogram. The information provided by a heart magnetogram will be more detailed than an electrocardiogram. It can measure the weak and constant magnetic field in the diseased area and distinguish between the fetal and maternal heart magnetic fields, thus providing favorable conditions for prenatal monitoring and ensuring the safety of the fetus. Additionally, magnetic fields can be used to monitor the volume of blood in vessels and judge biochemical processes within cells.

Physicists predict that special magnetic clothing can be made to obtain a complete picture of the body's life activities through electronic computers. This method is particularly simple and effective for physical examinations.

　　神秘的人体磁现象
    近年来，科学家观测到，人的器官都能发出磁声。而且，健康人磁声的“音色”和受损伤人的“音色”不同。研究者可以通过倾听脑磁声了解脑子的工作情况。
    地球表面的磁场强度为０．５奥斯特。人们已习惯在这种磁场中生活。当地磁场的方向和磁力大小突发不规则的变化（如磁暴）时，某些地区人的死亡率和某些疾病的发病率会明显提高。地磁场强度降低，人体身高增长会减慢。巴西里约热内卢的地磁场总强度最低，那里的孩子身高比美国同岁孩子低；非洲卢旺达的地磁场总强度最高，那里的土丝族男子身高超过欧洲男子。精确的实验还表明，人体的脑、肺、心脏都发出微弱的磁场，当心脏病发作时，心脏发出的磁场就会有变化。这可用心磁图来诊断。心磁图提供的信息将比心电图更详细，它可以测出病区恒定的微弱磁场，还能把胎儿和母体的心磁场区分，从而为产妇的产前监护、保障胎儿安全提供有利条件。此外，利用磁场还可以监视血管中的血量和判断细胞中的生物化学过程。
    物理学家预言，可以制造特殊的磁衣，通过电子计算机获得整个人体的生命活动图。这种方法用于体检特别简单有效。
