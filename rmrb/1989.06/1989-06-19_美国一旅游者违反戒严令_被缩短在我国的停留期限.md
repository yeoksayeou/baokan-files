An American tourist, Joseph Kahn, violated martial law and had his stay in China shortened. According to information from relevant departments, the Beijing Public Security Bureau decided yesterday to shorten the duration of his stay in China.

On June 12, Kahn falsely claimed to be a British journalist and went to Huangcun, Daxing County, on the outskirts of Beijing. He spread rumors and incited unrest among some residents regarding the government's suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot. Some residents immediately refuted his lies and incitement on the spot and handed him over to the public security authorities.

Because Kahn engaged in activities inconsistent with his identity and violated Beijing Municipal Government Order No. 1, No. 3, and Article 5 of the "Law of the People's Republic of China on the Control of Entry and Exit of Aliens," the Beijing Public Security Bureau, in accordance with Article 16 of the "Law of the People's Republic of China on the Control of Entry and Exit of Aliens," decided to shorten his stay in China and ordered him to leave within 72 hours.

　　美国一旅游者违反戒严令
    被缩短在我国的停留期限
    新华社北京６月１９日电  记者从有关部门获悉：美国旅游者约瑟夫·卡恩因违反戒严令，北京市公安机关昨天决定缩短他在我国的停留期限。
    ６月１２日，卡恩谎称自己是英国记者到京郊大兴县黄村，就我平息反革命暴乱向一些居民散布谣言，进行挑唆煽动。一些居民当场对他的造谣和煽动进行了有力的批驳，并将他送交公安机关。
    由于卡恩从事了同他的身份不相符的活动，违反了北京市人民政府令第一号、第三号和《中华人民共和国外国人入境出境管理法》第五条的有关规定，北京市公安机关根据《中华人民共和国外国人入境出境管理法》第十六条的规定，决定缩短他在我国的停留期限，限他在７２小时内离开。
