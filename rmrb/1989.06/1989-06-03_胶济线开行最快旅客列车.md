The fastest passenger train on the Jiaoji Line, the "Qilu Number," began operation on June 1.

The "Qilu Number" train, known as the "Sky Train," takes only 5 hours and 29 minutes to travel from Jinan to Qingdao. This is 48 minutes faster than the original express train on the Jiaoji Line and more than 3 hours faster than the regular express train.

The interior and exterior decorations of the train are all made from Shandong products that have a strong local flavor. The color of the carriages changes with the seasons, with cool tones in the summer and warm tones in the autumn.
