Wan Li presided over a Chairman's Meeting today. The meeting decided to hold the eighth session of the Seventh National People's Congress Standing Committee on June 29.

The meeting conveyed the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, as well as important speeches by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, Comrade Li Peng, and Comrade Jiang Zemin at the closing of the Fourth Plenary Session.

The Chairman's Meeting believed that this session of the Standing Committee should be guided by the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee. It was suggested that the main agenda for the Standing Committee session include: studying and discussing the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, listening to a report on the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, deliberating on the draft of the "Law of the People's Republic of China on Assemblies, Processions, and Demonstrations" submitted by the State Council, and listening to a report on the national budget for 1988.

The meeting pointed out that the Chairman's Meeting held on May 10 had suggested that the Standing Committee listen to reports on the cleanup and rectification of companies and the drafting of the Press Law. Considering the current situation, further measures need to be taken for the work of cleaning up and rectifying companies. The drafting of the Press Law should summarize the experiences and lessons from the guidance of public opinion during the suppression of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot, and enrich relevant content. Therefore, these two reports are not included in the agenda for this session of the Standing Committee.

    新华社北京６月２６日电　全国人大常委会委员长万里今天上午主持召集委员长会议。会议决定，于６月２９日举行第七届全国人大常委会第八次会议。
    会上，传达了中国共产党第十三届中央委员会第四次全体会议精神和邓小平同志的重要讲话、李鹏同志的报告、江泽民同志在四中全会闭会时的讲话。
    委员长会议认为，这次常委会会议要以党的十三届四中全会精神为指导思想，建议常委会会议主要议程为：学习讨论党的十三届四中全会精神，听取关于平息在北京发生的反革命暴乱的报告，审议国务院关于提请审议《中华人民共和国集会游行示威法（草案）》的议案，听取关于１９８８年国家决算的报告等。
    会议指出，５月１０日召开的委员长会议曾建议常委会听取关于清理整顿公司情况的汇报、听取关于新闻法起草情况的汇报，考虑到当前情况，关于清理整顿公司的工作还要进一步采取措施，新闻法的起草工作还要总结在这次平息动乱和反革命暴乱中舆论导向工作的经验教训，充实有关内容，因此，这两个汇报暂不列入本次常委会会议议程。
