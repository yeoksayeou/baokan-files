More than 20 years ago, an American journalist, after riding on Japan's Tokaido Shinkansen electric train at a top speed of 210 kilometers per hour, wrote in admiration: "There is a sense of comfort like a sled gliding on a mirror-like ice field, and a sense of speed like a jet aircraft flying just above the ground..." Since the 1980s, with the development of science and technology, railways have entered a new era of high-speed development. For example, France's high-speed electric train set a world record with a top operating speed of 380 kilometers per hour and a travel speed exceeding 200 kilometers per hour. Due to its decisive advantages of low cost, low energy consumption, low operating costs, and high quality, it soon after its operation in 1981, attracted 80% of the passenger volume from aviation and automobile transport, setting an example of repaying engineering loans within 10 years. The Federal Republic of Germany's ICE electric train prototype reached a top speed of 406.9 kilometers per hour during a test run on May 1, 1988, breaking the world record set by France.

Currently, Western European countries are jointly promoting a plan for a pan-European high-speed railway network. Among them, countries like France, the Federal Republic of Germany, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Austria are mainly building new lines, while countries like the United Kingdom, Sweden, Italy, and Spain are mainly upgrading existing lines. The realization of the high-speed network will further promote the economic integration of Western Europe. In addition, after the operation of the high-speed line between Moscow and Leningrad, the Soviet Union also planned in the second half of 1988 to build a high-speed railway network with speeds of 300-350 kilometers per hour and participated in the European mainline railway network agreement to upgrade existing lines to a standard of 160 kilometers per hour. Japan is also vigorously promoting the construction of the "one-day action circle" (i.e., Tokyo to various parts of the country in one day) for the new Shinkansen. India also plans to raise the top speed of some lines to 160 kilometers per hour. Experts predict that by the turn of the century, some technologically advanced countries may put into operation the "ground flying machine" - magnetic levitation trains, with speeds reaching 500 kilometers per hour.

At the same time, more and more countries are seeing an increase in their railway electrification rates. Since the 1980s, the total length of electrified railways in the world has increased from 165,000 kilometers to approximately 190,000 kilometers, and the electrification rate has risen from 12.7% to 15.8%, accounting for more than 45% of the world's total railway volume. The Soviet Union and Eastern European countries, except for East Germany which started later, have an electrification rate of about one-third, accounting for 60%-80% of the transport volume, achieving electrification on busy main lines. Other parts of the lines and shunting operations use a reasonable layout of internal combustion traction. This shows that railways can utilize various energy sources such as coal, coal-based synthetic fuels, hydroelectric power, nuclear power, etc., which is something that no other mode of transport can match.

Developing high-speed passenger transport, using electric traction, compared with aviation and high-speed roads, also has the benefits of saving oil resources and environmental protection. Here is a very attractive figure. According to a Soviet plan to build a high-speed railway network, it is planned to complete by the year 2000 a central-southern high-speed passenger dedicated line from Moscow to Crimea, the North Caucasus, and the Black Sea coast, with a total length of approximately 2,500 kilometers and a top speed of 300-350 kilometers per hour. In the long term, a high-speed railway network connecting Eastern and Western European countries will be built, with a total length of 10,500 kilometers. Upon completion of the plan, approximately 30 million tons of jet engine fuel can be saved annually, and to obtain these fuels, about 200 million tons of crude oil need to be mined and processed.

Modern railways, in addition to continuing to play a leading role in the transportation of bulk goods such as coal, ore, grain, timber, and building materials, can also play a role in low-cost, high-delivery-speed advantages in medium and long-distance refrigerated transportation, container transportation, and other fast cargo transportation according to the requirements of consignors, winning this part of the transportation market. Overall, for a considerable period in the future, coal transportation will remain the main task of railways.

To adapt to the aforementioned changing situation, it is necessary to rely on technological progress to transform and develop this traditional industry, making it a powerful and multifunctional modern transportation tool.

　　世界铁路高速化电气化
    黄乃勇
    ２０多年前，一位美国新闻记者乘坐日本东海道新干线最高时速２１０公里的电动车组后，感叹地写道：“有一种像雪橇在镜子般的冰原上滑行那样的舒适感，像喷气式飞机贴在地面上飞行那样的速度感……”而８０年代以来，随着科学技术的发展，铁路又进入了高速化的新时期。如法国的高速火车电动车组创造了最高运行时速３８０公里、旅行时速超过２００公里的世界纪录。由于它取得了低造价、低能耗、低成本、高质量的决定性优势，自１９８１年投入运营不久，就吸引了航空和汽车客运量的８０％，开创了在１０年内由公司盈利偿还工程贷款本息的范例。联邦德国的ＩＣＥ电动车组样车在１９８８年５月１日运行试验时最高时速达到４０６．９公里，打破了法国创造的世界纪录。
    目前，西欧各国正在协力推行一项全欧高速铁路网的规划。其中法国、联邦德国、比利时、荷兰、奥地利等国主要是修建新线，而英国、瑞典、意大利、西班牙等国主要是改造既有线。高速网的实现将会进一步促进西欧经济一体化。此外，苏联在莫斯科—列宁格勒高速线运营后，１９８８年下半年也拟定了修建时速为３００—３５０公里的高速铁路网规划，并参加了按时速１６０公里标准改造既有线的欧洲干线铁路网协议。日本仍在大力推进“一日行动圈”（即东京至全国各地一日往返）的新干线建设蓝图。印度也准备将部分线路的最高时速提高到１６０公里。专家们预测，到下世纪初，某些技术领先国家有可能使“地上飞机”——磁浮列车投入运行，时速可达５００公里。
    与此同时，越来越多的国家铁路电化率日益提高。８０年代以来，世界电气化铁路的总长度由１６．５万公里增加到约１９万公里，电化率由１２．７％上升到１５．８％，承担世界铁路总运量的比重由３５％增加到４５％以上。苏联及东欧诸国，除民主德国起步较晚外，电化率均达到１／３左右，承担运量比重达到６０％—８０％，实现了繁忙干线电气化。其它大部分线路和调车作业采用内燃牵引的合理布局。这说明铁路运输可以利用各种能源，如煤炭、煤基合成燃料、水力、核能等。这是任何其它运输方式都不能比的。
    发展高速客运，采用电力牵引，如与航空、高速公路相比，还兼具节约石油资源和环境保护的效益。以下是一个颇具吸引力的数字。根据苏联拟定的一项修建高速铁路网的规划，拟在２０００年建成从莫斯科到克里米亚、北高加索和黑海沿岸的总长约２５００公里、最高速度３００—３５０公里／小时的中央—南方高速客运专线，远期将建成连接东西欧国家的高速铁路网，其总长度将达１０５００公里。规划完成后，每年可以节省约３０００万吨飞机喷气发动机燃料，而为了得到这些燃料，需要开采和加工约两亿吨原油。
    现代化铁路除可继续在煤炭、矿石、粮食、木材、建筑材料等大宗散装货物运输领域发挥优势外，在中长距离的冷藏运输、集装箱运输和根据货主要求的其它快速货物运输等领域，也可以发挥低运输成本、高送达速度的优势，赢得这部分运输市场。总的看，今后在相当长的时期内煤炭运输仍将是铁路的主要任务。
    适应上述多变的形势，就必须依靠技术进步，改造和发展铁路这个传统产业，使之成为能力强大、功能齐全的现代化运输工具。
