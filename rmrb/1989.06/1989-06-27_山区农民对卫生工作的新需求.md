Edition: 5

Through conversations with farmers, it has been learned that currently, farmers in mountainous areas (especially those in Yi ethnic minority areas) have new demands for health work.

First, they hope that health technicians will go to the countryside to guide the masses in building civilized villages (towns) and households, providing them with a clean, beautiful, and comfortable living environment. Second, they hope that more medical personnel will frequently go to villages (groups) to conduct health check-ups for farmers, detect and treat various diseases early, and carry out health consultation services in rural areas with a focus on family planning. Third, they hope that relevant departments will translate the instructions for contraceptives sent to ethnic minority areas into ethnic minority languages. Fourth, they look forward to more and better health science and education films being shown in the countryside to propagate health knowledge through visual methods. Fifth, they hope to compile a series of health knowledge books suitable for farmers, introducing self-diagnosis of common and frequently occurring diseases, as well as folk remedies and tested prescriptions, with the books written in simple and easy-to-understand language. Sixth, they hope that medical personnel will bring modern auxiliary diagnostic instruments to the countryside for mobile medical services to meet the needs of farmers in mountainous areas for medical treatment.

　　山区农民对卫生工作的新需求
    在同农民交谈中了解到，目前山区（特别是彝族聚居区）农民对卫生工作有新的需求。
    一是希望卫生技术人员下乡指导群众搞好文明村（镇）、户的卫生建设，使他们有一个清洁、优美、舒适的生活环境。二是希望有更多的医务人员经常下村（组），为农民作健康体检，对各种疾病及早发现，及早治疗，在农村多开展以计划生育为主的健康咨询服务活动。三是希望有关部门把发往少数民族地区的避孕药具（品）的说明书译成少数民族文字。四是盼望有更多更好的卫生科教电影下乡，用直观方法宣传卫生知识。五是希望编印适合农民口味的卫生知识丛书，介绍常见病、多发病的自我诊断以及草方、验方等，要求丛书文字通俗易懂、易学。六是希望医务人员携带现代化辅助诊断仪器下乡巡回医疗，以适应山区农民治病的需要。　　　　　　四川省凉山彝族自治州甘洛县广播电视局
