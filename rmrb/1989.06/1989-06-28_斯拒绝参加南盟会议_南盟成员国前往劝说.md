Sri Lanka's participation in the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) ministerial meeting scheduled for July 1 in Islamabad has become the most pressing issue for member states. High-level contacts between relevant countries and Sri Lanka are underway.

Sri Lanka is boycotting the meeting to protest India's refusal to withdraw approximately 45,000 Indian troops from its soil. Currently, Sri Lanka's foreign minister has informed Pakistan's foreign minister of this decision, stating that if India does not withdraw all its troops from Sri Lanka by July 29, Sri Lanka will not be able to sit with Indian representatives at the meeting. Following the announcement of this news, relevant countries have been engaging in high-level talks with Sri Lanka, urging it to consider the broader interests of South Asian cooperation and participate in the meeting.

At present, delegations from Nepal, the Maldives, India, Bhutan, and Bangladesh have arrived in Islamabad, but there are no signs that Sri Lanka will change its stance. Informed sources indicate that Pakistan will send a high-level delegation to Colombo to persuade Sri Lanka to attend the meeting. Meanwhile, the Indian Embassy in Pakistan issued a statement saying that any attempt to include bilateral issues in the SAARC meeting agenda would violate the charter of the alliance.

To persuade and await Sri Lanka's participation, other member states have decided to postpone the meeting.

　　斯拒绝参加南盟会议  南盟成员国前往劝说
    本报伊斯兰堡６月２８日电  记者任毓骏报道：斯里兰卡是否参加将于７月１日在伊斯兰堡举行的南亚区域合作联盟外长会议已成为各成员国最为关注的问题，有关国家同斯里兰卡的高层接触正在进行之中。
    斯里兰卡是为了抗议印度拒绝从斯撤走约４．５万名印军而抵制这次会议的。目前，斯里兰卡外长已致电巴基斯坦外长，通报了这一决定，表示印度如不能在７月２９日之前全部撤走驻斯印军，斯里兰卡将不能和印度代表坐在一起参加会议。这一消息公布后，有关国家纷纷和斯里兰卡进行高层接触，劝说斯从南亚合作大局考虑，参加这次会议。
    目前，尼泊尔、马尔代夫、印度、不丹和孟加拉国的代表团已先后到达伊斯兰堡，但斯里兰卡还没有改变决定的迹象。消息灵通人士称，巴基斯坦将派一高级代表团去科伦坡，劝说斯里兰卡出席这次会议。与此同时，印度驻巴基斯坦使馆发表了一项声明说，任何企图把双边问题纳入南盟会议日程的作法都是违背这一联盟的章程的。
    为了说服和等待斯里兰卡能参加会议，其他成员国已决定会议推迟召开。
