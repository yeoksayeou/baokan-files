Today, a reporter visited the streets of the capital and saw that grain stores, vegetable markets, and food stores that have been operating continuously have basically restored the supply of grains, meat, eggs, vegetables, and other main food items to normal levels.

According to relevant officials from the Beijing Municipal Government, all 1075 grain stores in the capital had no out-of-stock situations today, and the trend of people rushing to buy grains has subsided. With the help of the People's Liberation Army, the amount of grain transported to the stores has exceeded the amount sold. The variety of vegetables is abundant, with a total sales volume reaching 2000,000 kilograms, approaching the daily supply level. The supply of pork, fresh eggs, and fresh milk has also increased significantly compared to previous days.

In the capital's market, the supply of goods is gradually improving, but the general situation in stores is that they open late and close early.

　　首都粮肉菜供应趋正常
    公共电汽车线路已开通１４５条
    据新华社北京６月９日电  记者今天在首都街头采访时看到，一直坚持开门营业的粮店、菜店、副食店内，粮食、肉、蛋、菜以及其它主要副食品的供应业已基本恢复正常。
    据北京市政府有关负责同志介绍，首都１０７５家粮店今天均无脱销现象，群众抢购粮食的势头已趋下降。由于解放军的大力协助，运进粮店的粮食已大于销售的粮食。蔬菜品种繁多，总销量已达２００万公斤，接近平日的供应水平。猪肉、鲜蛋、鲜奶的供应也比前几天有大幅度增加。
    在首都市场上，商品供应日趋好转，但商店普遍的情况是开门较晚，关门较早。
    据新华社北京６月９日电　（记者潘善棠）今晨７点多钟，穿越北京市中心的１、４、５２、５７路公共汽车，经过天安门前，又开始在东西长安街上行驶。据统计，截至下午２点，全市已有１４５条公共电汽车线路开通。
