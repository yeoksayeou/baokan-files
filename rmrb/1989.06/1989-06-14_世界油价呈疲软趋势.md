Title: Global Oil Prices Show Signs of Weakness

The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) held a ministerial-level meeting in early June, reaching a new agreement to limit oil production in the second half of the year. They claimed to maintain oil prices at current levels. However, in recent days, oil prices on the global market have generally fallen. The price of West Texas Intermediate crude oil has dropped below $20 per barrel, reaching $19.35 today. The price of North Sea Brent crude oil has fallen below $17 per barrel, reaching $16.90 today. The price of Saudi light crude oil has fallen below $16 per barrel, reaching $15.25 today. These trends indicate that oil prices in the second half of the year will likely remain weak.

The fundamental factor behind the weak trend in global oil prices is the imbalance in supply and demand. It is estimated that in the second half of this year, global oil demand will continue to grow. The world's oil consumption is approximately 51.1 million barrels per day, an increase from the 50 million barrels per day in the fourth quarter of last year. The demand for OPEC oil is approximately 21 million barrels per day, an increase of about 3% compared to the same period last year. This is a favorable situation for the stability of the global oil market. This June meeting of OPEC set the total production quota (essentially the export volume) for each country in the second half of the year at 19.5 million barrels per day, an increase of 1 million barrels per day from the 18.5 million barrels per day in the first half of the year. This increase can be fully absorbed by the market. However, the problem is that the actual production of OPEC countries in the first half of the year has already exceeded the quota by 1.5 to 2 million barrels per day. In particular, at this meeting, Kuwait, when signing the production cut agreement, stated that it would not accept the quota limit. Kuwait's oil minister clearly announced that the new agreement's quota for Kuwait is 1.1 million barrels per day, which is too low, and it would produce 1.35 million barrels per day. Moreover, market monitoring indicates that in recent days, Kuwait's daily oil exports have exceeded 1.7 million barrels. The United Arab Emirates and several other countries have also significantly exceeded their quotas by increasing oil exports. As a result, OPEC's total oil supply has already exceeded market demand. If OPEC countries compete to increase oil exports in the second half of the year, seeking a larger market share, the fundamentally balanced global oil market will be disrupted, and oil prices will fall accordingly.

Saudi Arabia's oil pricing policy is also an important factor contributing to the weakness in oil prices in the second half of the year. At the insistence of Saudi Arabia, this OPEC meeting decided to change the previously set "target price" of $18 per barrel to a "reference price," providing a basis for OPEC countries to reduce prices and sell. The Saudi oil minister proposed at this meeting that oil prices should be determined by the market and not set at $18 per barrel as an official price, because if countries adhere to production (export) quotas, oil prices can reach $18 to $20 per barrel. However, it is revealed that Saudi Arabia's real intention is to prevent oil prices from rising too high. Last month, Saudi King Fahd said that OPEC's oil production must be increased, otherwise, due to strong market demand, oil prices may rise to $26 per barrel, which is not beneficial for OPEC countries. Oil market experts here generally believe that Saudi Arabia, with its particularly abundant oil resources and extremely low extraction costs, hopes to keep oil prices around $15 per barrel to gain a larger market share.

How exactly will oil prices in the second half of this year develop? This remains to be seen. Oil market analysts here estimate that there is a high probability of a $2 per barrel price drop, but it is unlikely to plummet. Because maintaining the basic stability of the oil market remains in the common interest of both OPEC and non-OPEC oil-producing countries.

　　世界油价呈疲软趋势
    本报记者  刘开宸
    石油输出国组织（欧佩克）６月上旬举行部长级会议，达成了限制今年下半年石油产量的新协议，声称要使下半年油价保持在目前水平上。但是这几天来，世界石油市场价格普遍滑落。美国西得克萨斯中质油跌到每桶２０美元之内，今天为１９．３５美元。英国北海布伦特原油跌到每桶１７美元之内，今天为１６．９０美元。沙特轻质油跌到每桶１６美元之内，今天为１５．２５美元。这些反映了今年下半年油价将呈现疲软的趋势。
    世界油价走势疲软的根本因素是供求关系不平衡，据估计，今年下半年，世界石油需求将继续增长。全世界石油的消费量约为每天５１１０万桶，比去年第四季度每天的５０００万桶有所增加。对欧佩克的石油需求量约为每天２１００万桶，比去年同期需求量增加约３％。这是世界石油市场稳定的有利形势。这次欧佩克６月会议确定今年下半年各国石油产量（实际上是石油出口量）的总限额为每天１９５０万桶，比上半年的１８５０万桶多１００万桶，增加部分完全能被市场吸收。但问题在于今年上半年欧佩克国家实际产量已每天高出１５０万—２００万桶。特别是在这次会议上，科威特在签署限产协议时，表示将不接受配额限制。科威特石油部长明确宣布，新协议按比例给科威特的配额为每天１１０万桶，太低了，它将日产１３５万桶。不仅如此，据市场监测，近几天，科威特每天石油出口１７０多万桶。阿联酋等其它几个国家，也在较多地超过限额增加石油出口。这样，欧佩克的石油总供应量已多于市场的需求量。如果下半年欧佩克各国竞相攀比，超额扩大石油出口，争取更多的市场份额，供需基本平衡的世界石油市场，就会受到冲击，油价也将因此下跌。
    沙特的油价政策，也是促使下半年油价疲软的一个重要因素。在沙特的坚持下，这次欧佩克会议决定把原来规定的每桶１８美元的“目标价”改为“参考价”，这为欧佩克各国削价求售找到了根据。沙特石油部长在这次会议上提出，油价应由市场来决定，不必把每桶１８美元定为官价，因为如各国遵守生产（出口）配额，每桶油价可达１８美元—２０美元。但据透露，沙特的真实意图是防止油价过高。上个月，沙特国王法赫德说，欧佩克的石油产量必须提高，否则由于市场需求强劲，油价可能上涨到每桶２６美元，对欧佩克国家并不利。这里的石油市场专家普遍认为，沙特以其特别丰富的石油资源，非常低的采油成本，希望油价保持在每桶１５美元左右，以便争取更大的市场份额。
    今年下半年油价的具体情况究竟如何？有待继续观察。这里的石油市场分析家估计，每桶降价２美元左右的可能性较大，但不致于暴跌。因为保持石油市场的基本稳定，仍是欧佩克内外产油国的共同利益所在。
