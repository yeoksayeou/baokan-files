    ●余洋
    北约组织是西方世界最大的军事集团，成立于1949年4月，到今年已整整四十周年。北约的成员国现有16个，其中除美国和加拿大是北美国家外，其余均是欧洲国家。北约的兵力也主要部署在欧洲。
    目前北约组织的兵力有多少？据有关资料统计，其总兵力大约有500多万人，占世界总兵力2650万人的20％。其中女兵大约有30万人。女兵最多的是美国，约有20万人。
    北约组织中兵力最多的国家是美国，约占北约总兵力的1／3多。兵力在50万以上的有意大利、土耳其、法国、联邦德国等。兵力在30万人以上的有西班牙、英国和希腊等。兵力在10万以上的有挪威、荷兰、丹麦和比利时等。兵力不足10万人的有葡萄牙和加拿大。兵力最少的是卢森堡，只有1200余人。冰岛虽是北约成员国，但本国并没有正规军，只有海洋巡逻队100余人，其防务由北约组织负责，被称为“无兵之国”。
    北约各国的兵力分属陆军、空军、海军、海军陆战队和其他兵种，如宪兵部队、警卫队和警察部队等。
    此外，北约各国除正规常备军之外，还有经过训练的预备役兵员大约700万人。
