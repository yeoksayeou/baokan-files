	Money in the Hands of Children
	– A Glimpse into Children's Consumption

	Qin Hua

	Not long ago, the robe of the "little emperor" was draped over today's only children in China. They not only possess "supreme" power but also have substantial "imperial salaries." Take a look—

	The Burden of Red Envelopes

	Here is a set of data:

	According to a survey in Xiangxiang City, Hunan Province, the more than ten thousand urban schoolchildren received 9 million yuan in red envelopes during the 1989 Spring Festival, equivalent to the savings deposits of two savings institutions in the city.

	In a primary school in Shenzhen, 1,200 students received a total of 150,000 yuan in red envelopes.

	In Nanjing's Qinhuai District, Fengyou Temple Primary School received 210,000 yuan in red envelopes in one day, a 25% increase from 1988. A third-grade student surnamed Xu alone received 740 yuan, topping the list.

	In Jiangsu, a colonel from a certain unit brought his 9-year-old son to visit his maternal grandmother in Shaoxing during the Spring Festival and returned with a Casio watch. Meanwhile, a lieutenant's 9-month-old daughter received red envelopes equivalent to her soldier father's annual salary.

	With more money in their hands, children go to buy firecrackers, balloons, and play electronic games. Some parents take the money for themselves, while others manage it for the children, spending it on food and clothing.

	Distorted Scholarships

	According to surveys in Guangzhou, Shenzhen, and Foshan, some parents set up their own "scholarships" to motivate their children to study. For example, 10 yuan for a perfect score, 8 yuan for 90 points, 5 yuan for 80 points, and 1 yuan for 70 points. Those who fail get fined 10 yuan. Since the standards are not high, many children can get the "scholarship."

	A third-grade student said her father had an agreement with her: if she scored above 98 in Chinese and Math, she would get a scholarship of 10 yuan. If she scored below 95, she would be fined 10 yuan. The girl said that if she ranked first in the class, she would get a scholarship of 100 yuan. She already has 600 yuan in savings.

	Money can motivate students to get high scores, but it can also be used to "buy" high scores. The son of an advertising company manager is only 12 years old. Before a math exam, he followed his father's example of recruiting talent, offering 2 yuan per question, with a full package for 20 yuan. During the exam, as soon as the teacher turned away, many small paper balls flew to his side. Due to too many "bidders," the teacher found out.

	If the direct motivation for receiving an education is money, then such education is doomed to fail.

	In recent years, the number of dropouts among primary and secondary school students has rapidly increased. One very important reason is that under the impact of the commodity economy, some parents cannot resist the temptation of money. They bet on making money with their young children, which is a historical tragedy.

	Increasing Pocket Money

	How much pocket money does a primary school student have? According to statistics from two classes in Jichanglu Primary School in Tangshan, the average is 86 yuan per person.

	A young mother complained, "I don't want my child to spend so much pocket money, but my child's grandparents, paternal grandparents, and maternal grandparents often 'sponsor' him, and I don't know how much money he has."

	In Guangzhou, there is an individual fish seller who dries wet banknotes on the balcony every day after work. He and his son, who is in primary school, have an agreement: each time he can only grab a handful of money. Initially, the son only grabbed small denominations, but gradually, his hand reached for the larger denominations, and the father turned a blind eye.

	Nowadays, the "little emperor's" appetite is being spoiled by adults, and money is spent like water. A 7-year-old child of an individual business owner often has a few "big notes" in his pocket. When he enters a familiar restaurant, the boss immediately bows and escorts him to the seat. The child orders dishes more skillfully than his father, opening his mouth to sea cucumber and closing it to shrimp.

	According to a report in the Labor Daily, some middle schools in Shanghai have seen the phenomenon of usury. Some junior high school students, in order to smoke, drink, or hold birthday banquets, borrow money from wealthy classmates. The repayment period is usually one month or half a year. If not repaid on time, 10 yuan will increase by 5 jiao per day. A student made a profit of over 100 yuan from lending money.

	Confusion, Reflection, and Solutions

	There are three reasons why children have more money in their pockets. First, the public has more money; second, the influence of the recent consumption boom; and third, the bias in educational methods.

	The facts show that money has distorted the minds of some primary school students. "Wealthy and arrogant" students are often envied, while those with less money learn to lie, and some resort to stealing and cheating. Facing this phenomenon, parents are troubled, and teachers are confused. Children need healthy money education and consumption guidance.

	Tianjin has opened a "Learn from Lei Feng, Love the Country" savings account.

	Some schools in Nanjing have jointly opened a "Red Scarf Savings" activity with society. Some praise this as cultivating children's frugal habits and utilizing idle social funds. Others believe it will lead to children comparing savings with each other.

	Following the first children's bank in the United States, China's Shanxi Jiaocheng has opened a "Children's Savings Bank." The staff are all students, and the service objects are also children. On the first day of opening, there were more than 100 young customers, with a business volume of over 3,500 yuan.

	Encouraging children to save is one aspect, and timely money education for children should also be followed. Some countries in the world have long implemented family, school, and government combined money education for the next generation.

	In the United States, it is customary to regard pocket money as a reward for household chores from a young age. In primary schools, classrooms are used to simulate society, helping students understand the social circulation of money.

	In Swedish primary school textbooks for lower grades, there are contents about money, commodities, and taxes.

	To correct children's bad habit of "spending money like water," Japanese educators believe that money education should start at the age of three.

	Guiding children's consumption and cultivating children's healthy and rational money concepts are very important for children's physical and mental growth, character shaping, and moral cultivation, and should not be neglected.

### 金钱，在孩子们身上——儿童消费一瞥

　　金钱，在孩子们身上    
    ——儿童消费一瞥
    秦华
    曾几何时，“小皇帝”的龙袍套在了当今中国独生子女的身上，他们不但拥有“至高无上”的权力，同时也有可观的“皇薪俸禄”。请看——
    沉重的压岁钱
    这里有一组数据：
    据湖南湘乡市调查：全市城镇万余名小学生，１９８９年春节所得压岁钱达９０万元，相当于市区两个储蓄所的吸储数。
    深圳市一小学１２００名学生的压岁钱加起来竟达１５万元。
    南京市秦淮区凤游寺小学一天存储压岁钱２．１万元，比１９８８年增长２５％，一位三年级姓徐的男生独得７４０元，“荣登”榜首。
    江苏某部一位中校军官，春节带着９岁的儿子去绍兴姥姥家拜年，背回一架卡西欧；而一位中尉刚满９个月的女儿所得的压岁钱，相当于当兵爸爸一年的军饷。
    孩子手中的压岁钱多了，就去买鞭炮、汽球、玩电子游戏；有的父母把钱占为己有，还有的则替孩子包办，用在吃穿上。
    扭曲的奖学金
    据广州、深圳、佛山等地孩子花钱状况的调查表明，一些家长为了刺激孩子学习，自设“奖学金”，比如：一门功课考满分奖１０元，９０分奖８元，８０分奖５元，７０分奖１元，不及格则罚１０元。由于标准不高，很多孩子都能拿到“奖金”。
    一位３年级小学生说，爸爸和她有“协定”，如果语文数学考试都在９８分以上，就可得奖学金１０元，如果在９５分以下，就罚款１０元。这位女学生说：如果在全班考第一，可得奖金１００元，她自己已有６００元存款。
    金钱可以刺激学生考高分，也可用来“买”高分。有个广告装潢公司经理的儿子才１２岁，在数学考试前学爸爸招聘人才，２元一题，全包２０元，考试时老师只要一转身，便有许多小纸团飞到他的身边。由于“投标”者太多，给老师发现了。
    假如受教育的直接动因就是金钱，那么这种教育注定要失败的。
    最近几年中小学生辍学队伍的迅速扩大，其中一个很重要的原因，就是在商品经济冲击下，一些家长经不住金钱的诱惑，他们把发财的赌注压在幼小的孩子身上，这是历史的悲哀。
    看涨的零用钱
    一个小学生手中有多少零用钱？唐山市机场路小学对两个班的统计是，每人平均８６元。
    一位年轻妈妈抱怨说，“我并不想让孩子花那么多零用钱，但孩子的爷爷奶奶、外公外婆不时地‘赞助’，我也弄不清他到底有多少钱。”
    广州有个卖鱼个体户，每天收工后都要在阳台上晾晒湿淋淋的人民币，他和他那读小学的儿子“君子协定”：每次只能用手抓一把钱，起初儿子只抓面额小的，慢慢地，哪里面额大手就往哪里伸，做父亲的视而不见。
    时下，“小皇帝”的胃口被大人越宠越大，花钱似流水。一位个体户７岁的孩子，兜里常有几张“大团结”，进了熟识的饭馆，老板马上毕恭毕敬地抱为上座，那孩子点菜比老子还精，张口海参，闭口对虾。
    据劳动报报道，上海部分中学出现了放高利贷现象。一些初中学生为了抽烟、喝酒或操办生日礼宴，便向有钱同学借，一般还贷期为一个月或半年，如到期不还，十元钱过一天加五毛，有个学生放贷获利１００余元。
    困惑　思考　出路
    儿童口袋里的钱多了，有三个原因。一是群众手里比较富裕；二是近年来消费热的影响；三是教育方法上的偏颇。
    事实说明，金钱已扭曲了部分小学生的心灵。“财大气粗”的学生往往令人羡慕，而钱少的学生则学会了讲假话，有的因此采取了偷骗的不正当行为。面对这种现象，家长苦恼、老师困惑。儿童需要健康的金钱教育和消费指导。
    天津市开办了学雷锋爱国小储蓄。
    南京市部分学校与社会联合开办红领巾储蓄活动，有人赞扬这样做培养了儿童的艰苦朴素的习惯，又利用了社会上的闲散资金。也有的则认为会导致孩子间对存钱的互相攀比。
    继美国第一家儿童银行之后，我国山西交城办起了“儿童储蓄银行”，职员都是在校学生，服务对象也是儿童。开业第一天，就有１００多名小顾客，营业额达３５００多元。
    鼓励儿童储蓄是一个方面，对儿童的金钱教育也应该及时跟上。世界上有些国家很早就对下一代实施家庭、学校、政府三者结合的金钱教育。
    美国习惯从小把零用钱看作从事家务劳动的报酬。小学里还用教室模拟社会，帮助学生了解金钱的社会流通情况。
    在瑞典小学低年级教材中，就有金钱、商品、税金等内容。
    为了矫正小孩“挥金如土”的坏习惯，日本教育家认为，金钱教育应该从３岁开始。
    指导儿童消费，培养儿童健康合理的金钱观，对儿童的身心成长、性格塑造、品德修养都有很重要的作用，千万忽视不得。
