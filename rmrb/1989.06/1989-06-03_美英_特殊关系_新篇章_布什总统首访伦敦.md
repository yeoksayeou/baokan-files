A New Chapter in the "Special Relationship" Between the U.S. and the UK
– President Bush's First Visit to London
By Chen Te-an, Our Correspondent

Yesterday, President Bush concluded his two-day visit to London and departed for home. Observers here believe this was a "successful visit" that marked a new beginning. The "historic talks" between the two countries' leaders signify that the "special relationship" between the UK and the U.S. has opened a "new chapter."

As the grand finale of his tour of four European countries, President Bush visited London at a time when East-West relations were undergoing significant changes and NATO's internal dynamics were also shifting. For some time, fierce debates within NATO over short-range nuclear weapons had cast a shadow of division over the alliance. This made the U.S. feel that "overcoming European divisions and promoting Western unity" had become an urgent priority. In the UK, given the increasing weight of West Germany on the U.S.'s diplomatic scales, the media had raised questions about whether the "special relationship" between the UK and the U.S. still existed. Therefore, clarifying doubts, consolidating and developing the "special relationship" between the UK and the U.S., and "maintaining the unity of Western allies" were the primary goals of President Bush's visit to London.

In fact, the "special relationship" between the UK and the U.S. was indeed the main theme throughout the visit. During the visit, President Bush and British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher held what they described as "gloves-off, heart-to-heart" and "inspiring" discussions on a series of issues, including East-West relations, the Middle East, and South Africa. According to reports, the two sides reached "consensus on every topic." Both leaders agreed that the UK and the U.S. should work together to "end European divisions"; both agreed to work together to promote Gorbachev's reforms in the Soviet Union. Thatcher said that the two sides had "many similar ideas," making this one of the "most pleasant discussions" she had had in a long time.

After the talks, at a press conference in front of 10 Downing Street, the two leaders reaffirmed that the "special relationship" between the UK and the U.S. remains very close, denying any cracks in the relationship, and refuting the notion that President Bush's ascension to power and his proposal to reduce military forces in Europe had cooled the special relationship. President Bush said that the special relationship between the UK and the U.S. will continue to develop steadily. Thatcher added, "We are proud to have been and will continue to be among America's most important friends."

Maintaining the "special relationship" is a shared desire and need for both sides. For the UK, the U.S. is an important economic and trade partner. The U.S. is the UK's largest export market and its second-largest import market. Politically and militarily, the U.S. is the UK's most important ally. Maintaining the "special relationship" allows the UK to hold a privileged position within NATO, to obtain nuclear weapons, and to receive the kind of assistance it did during the Falklands War. Thatcher believes that the West still needs to maintain a strong defense and keep some pressure on the Soviet Union. Without the U.S., the West would not have an effective defense, nor would the UK have a strong defense.

For the U.S., although it is reviewing its policy towards the Soviet Union, its multi-faceted competition with the Soviet Union has not stopped. As former British Prime Minister Callaghan said, "The U.S. still needs the support of its allies."

However, there are also voices here suggesting that the "special relationship" between the UK and the U.S. is no longer what it used to be. One newspaper's commentary said, "The U.S. being our best friend is a thing of the past," and called for "abandoning the illusion of a special relationship and bringing Britain back to the mainstream of Europe."

It seems that how the new chapter of the "special relationship" between the UK and the U.S., opened by President Bush's visit to the UK, will continue and what it will contain, remains to be seen. However, the continuation of this special relationship is undeniable.

    美英“特殊关系”新篇章
    ——布什总统首访伦敦
    本报记者　陈特安
    昨天，布什总统已结束为期两天的伦敦之行，启程回国。此间观察家认为，这是一次继往开来的“成功的访问”。两国领导人“历史性的会谈”，标志着“英美特殊关系”揭开了“新的篇章”。
    作为欧洲4国之行的“压轴戏”，布什总统是在东西方关系出现重大转折、北约内部关系也在发生重大变化的背景下访问伦敦的。
    一个时期以来，北约内部在短程核武器问题上的激烈争吵，给北约投下分裂的阴影。这使美国感到“克服欧洲分裂，促使西方团结”已成为燃眉之急。而在英国，鉴于西德在美国的外交天平上份量加重，舆论界已提出“英美特殊关系是否依然存在”的疑问。因此，澄清疑问，巩固和发展“英美特殊关系”，“维护西方盟国的团结”，是布什总统伦敦之行的主要目的。
    事实上，“英美特殊关系”也确是贯串整个访问的主题。访问期间，布什总统和英国首相撒切尔夫人就东西方关系问题、中东问题、南非问题等一系列问题进行他们自己称之为“脱去手套、说心里话”、“令人鼓舞的”会谈。据报道，双方在“每一个话题上都取得了一致”。两位领导人都同意英美两国要共同为“结束欧洲分裂”努力；双方都同意共同为促进戈尔巴乔夫在苏联的改革而工作。撒切尔夫人说，双方在许多方面“都有相同的想法”，这是她“长时间以来最愉快的一次会谈”。
    会谈后，在唐宁街十号门前的记者招待会上，两位领导人重申“英美特殊关系依然很密切”，否认英美关系存在裂缝，反驳了那种所谓布什总统上台以及在他提出削减欧洲的军事力量之后，英美特殊关系变冷的论调。布什总统说，英美特殊关系将继续稳定发展。而撒切尔夫人则说：“我们为自己一直而且将继续属于美国最重要的朋友之列而自豪。”
    保持“英美特殊关系”，这是双方共同的愿望和需要。对英国来说，美国是英国重要的经济贸易伙伴。美国是英国最大的出口市场，又是它的第二大进口市场，在政治和军事上，美国是英国最重要的盟友。保持“特殊关系”，英国在北约内部就可处于优先地位，可以得到核武器，可以得到类似在马尔维纳斯群岛战争期间得到的那种帮助。撒切尔夫人相信，西方仍需要保持强大的防卫力量，仍需要对苏联保持一定的压力，如果“没有美国，西方就不可能有有效的防务”，也不可能有英国强大的防务。
    对美国来说，尽管它正在调查对苏政策，但它同苏联多方面的较量远未停止。正如英国前首相卡拉汉所说，“美国也仍需要取得盟国的支持。”
    然而，此间也有舆论认为，“英美特殊关系”早已今非昔比了。一家报纸的评论说，“美国仍是我们最好的朋友已成为过去”，该评论还呼吁“抛弃特殊关系的幻想，使英国回到欧洲的主流中来”。
    看来，由布什总统访英揭开的“英美特殊关系”新篇章如何继续写下去、写些什么，还有待观察，但这种特殊关系将继续下去，则是确定无疑的。
