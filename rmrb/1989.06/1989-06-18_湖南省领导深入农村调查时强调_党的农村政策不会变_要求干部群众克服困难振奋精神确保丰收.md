Hunan provincial leaders recently conducted inspections in rural areas and emphasized that the Party's rural policies will not change. They urged cadres and the masses to overcome difficulties, boost morale, and ensure a bumper harvest.

New China News Agency, Changsha, June 18 – (Reporter Yang Shancheng) Hunan Provincial Party Secretary and Governor Chen Bangzhu, along with Deputy Governor Zhuo Kangning, recently led relevant bureau and department heads from the provincial government to conduct inspections in Wangcheng County. They emphasized that the Party's rural policies will not change. They also called on all levels of party and government departments to further mobilize and organize all available forces to contribute to a bumper harvest for the entire province this year.

Hunan is a key grain-producing province in China. This year, 27.37 million mu of early rice has been planted, an increase of 3.1 million mu compared to last year. Among these, 9.8 million mu are hybrid early rice, an increase of 9.8 million mu compared to last year. Due to recent low temperatures and heavy rainfall across the province, the growth has been slow. However, with the recent improvement in weather, most of the seedlings are growing vigorously and are expected to yield a good harvest. However, due to social unrest in some areas in the previous period, the transportation of agricultural production materials such as fertilizers was temporarily disrupted. Some places spread rumors, and some farmers, fearing policy changes, cut down trees indiscriminately. Some individual business owners in rural areas even sold their self-owned vehicles. These phenomena have had some impact on agricultural production.

In response to these situations, Governor Chen Bangzhu and other responsible comrades called on the entire rural population of Hunan Province to seize the opportunity to mobilize and organize cadres and the masses, overcome various difficulties, boost morale, and effectively manage the late-stage field work for early rice and prepare for the late rice planting. They also called for active preparations for flood prevention and disaster relief to ensure a bumper harvest of early rice and strive to plant more late rice than last year, ensuring a bumper harvest for the year.

Chen Bangzhu and other comrades also emphasized that currently, it is necessary to reaffirm to the farmers the Party's unwavering commitment to its reform and opening-up policies in rural areas. The household contract responsibility system, which is based on family management, will not change and should be maintained and continuously improved. Farmers should be told not to doubt the Party's policies, not to believe in rumors, and to boldly develop production and work hard to become prosperous.

　　湖南省领导深入农村调查时强调
    党的农村政策不会变
    要求干部群众克服困难振奋精神确保丰收
    新华社长沙６月１８日电  （记者杨善清）湖南省委副书记、省长陈邦柱和副省长卓康宁近日带领省直有关厅局负责同志深入望城县农村调查时提出，党的农村政策不会变；各级党政部门要进一步动员和组织各方面力量，为夺取今年全省农业全面丰收作贡献。
    湖南是我国一个重点产粮省。今年栽插早稻２７３７万亩，比去年增加３１万亩，其中杂交早稻比上年多９８万亩。前段因全省低温多雨，长势缓慢；近日天气转好，大部分禾苗长势旺盛，可望丰收。但由于前一段部分地区出现社会动乱，化肥等农业生产资料运输一度受阻，有些地方出现谣传，有的农民怕政策变，因而发生乱砍树木现象，有的农村个体户还把自营的汽车卖掉。这些现象，给农业生产带来一定影响。
    针对这些情况，省长陈邦柱等负责同志向全省农村提出：一定要不失时机地动员组织干部群众，克服各种困难，振作精神，切实搞好早稻的后期田间管理和晚稻的备耕，积极作好防汛抗灾准备，力争早稻丰收，争取比去年多插一些晚稻，确保今年农业丰收。
    陈邦柱省长等同志还提出，目前，要向农民重申坚定不移地坚持党在农村的各项改革开放的方针政策。农村以家庭经营为主的联产承包责任制不会改变，应保持稳定并不断完善。要告诉农民对党的政策不要心存疑虑，不要听信谣传，可以大胆发展生产，勤劳致富。
