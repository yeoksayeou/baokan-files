New China News Agency, Beijing, June 2. Two-way fashion exchange—Taiwan's Central Daily News reported under this headline that, at the invitation of the Taipei Art and Culture Relations Enterprise Company, a 15-member delegation of mainland Beijing fashion models will visit Taipei in July to hold an eight-show fashion event over one week. They will also hold a seminar with local fashion designers to exchange views and experiences.

According to the person in charge of the Art and Culture Relations Enterprise, the mainland model delegation will only perform for observation and demonstration. The fashion show, tentatively named "Silk Road," will feature silk garments. However, the Taiwan side has specially requested that more ethnic and minority ethnic garments be included as the main focus of the performance.

　　北京时装模特儿７月赴台
    新华社北京６月２日电  两岸时装界也要交流——台湾中央日报以此为题报道说，应台北艺坊文化关系企业公司邀请，大陆北京时装模特儿代表队一行１５人，将于７月到台北举行一周８场的时装发表会，并将与此间的时装设计界人士举办座谈会，交换意见及心得。
    据艺坊文化关系企业负责人说，大陆模特儿代表队仅作观摩及示范性演出。原则上定名为“丝绸之路”的这场时装表演，展出内容均为丝绸制服装，但台湾方面特别要求多提供民族服装及少数民族服装作为演出展示的主要重点。
