Chen Xitong's Radio Address

Comrades, all members of the Communist Party, all members of the Communist Youth League, and all citizens of Beijing:

Starting from the early hours of June 3rd, a small group of rioters instigated a serious counter-revolutionary rebellion in our great capital, Beijing. To defend the socialist system, to protect the people's government, and to safeguard the lives and property of the people, under the decisive leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, the People's Liberation Army's martial law troops, along with the public security forces and the armed police, with courage and fearlessness, have swiftly crushed this counter-revolutionary rebellion. This is an initial victory in our struggle to stop the turmoil, maintain stability and unity, and foil counter-revolutionary plots.

Currently, the clearing of Tiananmen Square is basically complete, and the martial law troops have largely taken their positions. However, up to this point, this counter-revolutionary rebellion has not been completely quelled, and the situation remains grave. The capital is still in a state of emergency. Therefore, I, on behalf of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the Beijing Municipal Government, urgently appeal to all Party members, Youth League members, and all citizens of Beijing:

I call on you to take immediate action, to stand up at this critical moment, and to work closely with the martial law troops, public security personnel, and armed police to resolutely and thoroughly suppress this counter-revolutionary rebellion.

Starting from the early hours of June 3rd, a group of rioters, who were eager for chaos, exploited a traffic accident involving an armed police vehicle to incite some people to illegally set up barricades, loot military weapons and equipment, destroy and burn military vehicles, and block the martial law troops from taking their positions. They recklessly attacked, beat, and kidnapped soldiers and officers of the martial law troops and the armed police, resulting in over 1,000 injuries and deaths among the People's Liberation Army personnel. They ruthlessly attacked the Zhongnanhai and the Great Hall of the People, among other key locations, looted stores and buildings. Particularly heinous were the actions of a few rioters who stripped the clothes off fallen soldiers, leaving their bodies in the streets, hanging them on overpass railings, and even burning soldiers alive with gasoline. Some wounded soldiers, while being transported to hospitals, were intercepted by rioters and beaten to death. Among this group of rioters, many were released criminals who had not been reformed, gangsters, and criminals who had come to Beijing from other places. The counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in the capital is unprecedented since the founding of the nation. It is the malicious escalation of the plots of a very small number of people to create turmoil over the past month, and it fully exposes their evil intentions to oppose the Party's leadership, to oppose the socialist system, and to oppose the people's government.

In this counter-revolutionary rebellion, a small number of instigators and plotters have clearly put forward their political slogans and organizational programs. They arrogantly shout, "We want to eliminate all 46 million Party members," and they aim to overthrow the people's government elected by the National People's Congress. At this extremely critical and serious juncture, the Party and the government can no longer tolerate this, and there is no other choice but to take extraordinary measures to resolutely crush this counter-revolutionary rebellion. If anyone still insists on a stubborn stance, refuses to repent, and continues to plot and create turmoil, the people's government and the martial law troops will continue to take decisive measures and will not hesitate to punish severely.

Comrades, all Party members and Youth League members of Beijing, the Party and the people are testing us at this moment. In this sharp and intense struggle, we must be clear in our stance, firm in our position, fear no sacrifice, and resolutely defend the leadership of the Communist Party, resolutely defend the socialist system and the people's government, and resolutely defend the great achievements of the socialist revolution and construction.

Here, I once again urgently appeal to all citizens: I hope you will not believe or spread rumors, actively cooperate with and assist the martial law troops in carrying out their duties, and make your due efforts to quickly suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion and restore normal order;

I hope you will, with your actions, protect government agencies, factories, stores, schools, hospitals, and other units from being harmed by rioters, and firmly hold your posts and perform your duties;

I hope you will educate your children and do the work of your relatives, not to believe or spread rumors, not to go out to watch, not to participate in activities that are not conducive to suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and to prevent unnecessary losses.

The occurrence of the counter-revolutionary rebellion is also against the wishes of the vast majority of patriotic students. I hope that university students will cherish their time, quickly return to school, and resume classes, and with their actions, oppose the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

We also warn those who are still stubborn and refuse to change their ways: You must stop the rebellion immediately. If you insist on resisting, you will surely face severe punishment. We hope you will confess and reform, and seek leniency from the people.

　　陈希同同志的广播讲话
    北京市全体共产党员、共青团员、全体市民同志们：
    从６月３日凌晨开始，一小撮暴徒在我们伟大祖国首都北京，挑起了一场严重的反革命暴乱。为了保卫社会主义制度，保卫人民政权，保卫人民生命财产的安全，在党中央、国务院、中央军委的果断决策下，人民解放军戒严部队和首都公安干警、武警部队一起，以勇敢无畏的精神，一举粉碎了这场反革命暴乱。这是我们在制止动乱、维护安定团结、粉碎反革命阴谋的斗争中取得的一个初步的胜利。
    现在，天安门广场清场工作基本结束，戒严部队已大体就位。但是，到目前为止，这场反革命暴乱还没有完全平息，局势相当严峻，首都仍处于危急之中，为此，我代表北京市委、北京市政府向全市共产党员、共青团员和全体市民发出紧急呼吁：
    要求你们立即行动起来，在关键时刻挺身而出，与戒严部队、公安干警和武警部队密切协作，坚决彻底地平息这场反革命暴乱。
    从６月３日凌晨开始，一伙唯恐天下不乱的反革命暴徒，利用武警车辆的交通事故大做文章。他们挑动一些人非法设置路障，抢劫部队的武器装备，毁坏和焚烧军车，拦阻堵截戒严部队就位；他们肆意围攻、殴打和绑架戒严部队和武警部队的官兵，打死打伤１０００多名解放军人员；他们丧心病狂地多次冲击中南海，冲击人民大会堂等要害部门，抢劫商店和大楼。尤其令人发指的是，极少数暴徒竟然剥光解放军烈士的衣服，暴尸街头，挂在立交桥栏杆上，甚至灭绝人性地用汽油把战士烧死。有些战士受伤送往医院途中，被暴徒截住，竟把伤员活活打死。在这一群暴徒中，有许多就是没有改造好的刑满释放分子，流氓团伙以及外地流窜来京的作案分子。发生在首都的这起骇人听闻的反革命暴乱，是建国以来从未有过的，是一个多月来极少数极少数人阴谋制造动乱的恶性发展，是他们反对党的领导，敌视社会主义制度和人民政权罪恶企图的集中暴露。
    在这起反革命暴乱中，极少数挑动者和策划者已经十分明确地提出了他们的政治口号和组织纲领。他们狂妄地叫嚣“要把四千六百万党徒全部消灭干净”，要颠覆经全国人民代表大会选举产生的人民政府。在这种极端严重的紧要关头，党和政府忍无可忍，已经没有什么退路可言，只能采取非常措施，坚决粉碎这起反革命暴乱，除此之外，别无选择。如果有人还要坚持顽固立场，不思改悔，继续策划和制造暴乱，人民政府和戒严部队必将继续采取果断措施，坚决打击，严惩不贷。
    北京市全体共产党员，共青团员同志们，党和人民考验我们的时候到了，在这场尖锐激烈的斗争中，我们必须旗帜鲜明，立场坚定，不怕牺牲，坚决捍卫共产党的领导，坚决捍卫社会主义制度和人民政权，坚决捍卫社会主义革命和建设的伟大成果。
    在这里，我再次向全体市民发出紧急呼吁：希望你们不要听信和传播谣言，积极配合和协助戒严部队执行任务，为迅速平息反革命暴乱，恢复正常秩序作出应有的努力；
    希望你们以实际行动，保卫国家机关、工厂、商店、学校、医院等单位不受暴徒的侵害，并坚守工作岗位，忠于职守；
    希望你们教育好子女，做好亲属的工作，不要听信和传播谣言，不要上街围观，不要参与不利于平息反革命暴乱的活动，防止造成不必要的损失。
    出现反革命暴乱，也是违反绝大多数爱国学生意愿的。希望大学生们珍惜宝贵时间，尽快回校复课，以实际行动反对反革命暴乱。
    我们还要正告那些至今仍执迷不悟的暴乱分子，你们必须尽快停止暴乱行动，如果一意孤行，负隅顽抗，必将受到严重惩罚，希望你们坦白自首，悔过自新，争取人民的宽大处理。
