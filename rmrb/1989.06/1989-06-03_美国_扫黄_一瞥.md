    The U.S. serial killer Ted Bundy was sentenced to death by electrocution at the end of January in Florida. Before his execution, Bundy, when asked why he resorted to violence, said that reading pornographic books and magazines "was like an addiction, the more you read, the more you crave stronger stuff. One day... you start to think that actually doing it might be more exciting than just watching." Obviously, Bundy blamed his crimes on pornographic literature. Regardless of whether Bundy's words are credible or if he was just playing a trick, his last "words" have reignited the debate in the U.S. about the relationship between pornography and violence. The controversy may not subside anytime soon, but judicial authorities and feminist activists firmly believe that pornographic literature leads to violent crimes. Over the past two years, the U.S. Department of Justice has launched an unprecedented nationwide "anti-pornography" campaign.

    Pornographic culture is rampant in the U.S., with books, films, and television shows that blatantly expose sex, fights, and murders everywhere, constantly corrupting and invading people's minds. The video rental business, which is rampant in the U.S. market, is one of the means of spreading pornographic culture. It is estimated that about 20 million Americans now watch "blue videos" (even more pornographic than yellow videos) at least once a week. In addition to various pornographic magazines, videos, films, and television shows, the 1980s saw the emergence of a type of "pornographic telephone service" that, although it lacks visual images, is extremely harmful. These phones are special lines set up by pornographic businessmen. For a fee, you can listen to various obscene recordings. According to statistics, the annual sales of pornographic items in the U.S. reach 7 to 10 billion dollars. U.S. public opinion believes that unhealthy entertainment is wreaking havoc on people's minds, especially on young people.

    In 1986, the pornographic literature investigation committee led by former U.S. Attorney General Meese called for a legal and national movement to oppose the widespread dissemination of pornographic literature. Meese, in a 2000-page report, said that explicit pornographic descriptions are directly linked to sex crimes. The investigation committee proposed 92 recommendations to guide governments at all levels to take strict legal measures to eradicate pornographic literature. The Department of Justice began investigating and stopping the interstate mail-order activities of pornographic items in early 1987. Last August, the Federal Bureau of Investigation conducted a joint operation across states, suddenly raiding some pornographic stores in Washington D.C., Ohio, and Florida, seizing a large number of pornographic magazines and videos. The FBI's anti-pornography operation was carried out under the orders of the Department of Justice. The Department of Justice has already prosecuted more than 250 people last year. Previously, convictions on such charges were almost non-existent. In January of this year, in Boston, a Copenhagen businessman named Jensen was sentenced to 37 months in prison for importing child pornographic literature. In Seattle, a nightclub performer named Vakanti has already spent several months in prison. Stores that were once thriving by selling pornographic literature have now been forced to close in most parts of Cincinnati, Oklahoma City, and North Carolina. Customs officer O'Malley estimates that the import of child pornographic literature into the U.S. has been reduced by half in the past two years. Some local telephone companies have also banned customers from using their lines to "listen to dirty talk." A member of the anti-pornography group, McGready, said, "We are beginning to have clean cities."

    The U.S. anti-pornography campaign has received support and cooperation from various groups. Civil forces advocating the closure of various pornographic stores are on the rise and have received strong support from the government. The new anti-pornography law enacted by the federal government has given investigators "wings." Last autumn, a law passed by Congress not only made it easier to prosecute pornographic cases but also amended the criminal law to add a clause prohibiting the use of computers to advertise child pornographic literature. Courts and prosecutors at all levels, which previously often shelved pornographic cases, can now handle them promptly and decide them quickly.

    President Bush has said that his government will be committed to "anti-pornography," and Attorney General Thornburgh has long been a supporter of the "anti-pornography" policy. Facing an ever-expanding legal net, some U.S. pornographic businessmen have begun to consider changing their line of work. But the U.S. still has many difficulties to overcome in eradicating pornographic culture.

    美国“扫黄”一瞥
    ●元济
　　美国杀人犯特德·邦迪1月底在佛罗里达州被判坐电椅处死。临刑前，邦迪在回答他为什么采取暴力手段时说，阅读色情书报“就像上了瘾一样，愈来愈渴望更强烈的货色，有一天……你开始觉得，假如真的动手去做，可能比光看要刺激多了。”显然，邦迪把他的罪恶归咎于色情书刊。不论邦迪的话是否可信，也不管他的话是不是耍花招，他的临终“遗言”却使美国有关色情与暴力关系的争论再度热烈起来。争议可能暂时不会平息，不过，司法部门和女权运动人士坚信色情书刊会引起暴力犯罪。两年来，美国司法部在全国开展了一场规模空前的“扫黄运动”。
    美国色情文化泛滥成灾，赤裸裸暴露奸淫、斗殴和凶杀的书刊、电影及电视比比皆是，无时无刻不在腐蚀和侵袭着人们的心灵。充斥美国市场的录像带出租业是色情文化传播的途径之一，估计约有2000多万美国人现在每周至少看一次“蓝色录像”（比黄色录像更黄的色情录像）。除了各种黄色杂志、录像、电影、电视外，80年代又出现了一种虽无视觉形象但危害极大的“色情电话服务业”。这种电话是一些色情商人设立的专用电话，只要付费，就可以在电话里听到各种淫声秽语的录音。据统计，美国色情物品的销售额每年达70亿至100亿美元。美国社会舆论认为，不健康的娱乐业对人们，特别是对青少年在进行着一场精神上的浩劫。
    1986年，美国前司法部长米斯领导的色情文学调查委员会呼吁开展一场法律和全民运动，以反对广为传播的色情文学。米斯在长达2000页的报告中说，赤裸裸的色情描写与性犯罪有着直接联系。调查委员会提出了92项建议，指导各级政府采取严厉的法律措施取缔色情文学。司法部于1987年初，开始调查并制止色情物品的州际邮购活动。去年8月，美国联邦调查局曾采取跨州联合行动，突然搜查了华盛顿特区、俄亥俄和佛罗里达州等地的一些色情商店，没收了一大批色情杂志和录像带。联邦调查局的这次扫黄行动是根据美国司法部的命令进行的。司法部去年已对250多人绳之以法。从前以这种罪名定罪的几乎绝无仅有。今年1月在波士顿，一名叫詹森的哥本哈根商人以进口儿童色情书刊的罪名被判37个月徒刑。在西雅图，一个叫瓦坎蒂的夜总会演员已经度过几个月铁窗生活。以贩卖色情书刊而生意兴隆的商店，如今在辛辛那提、俄克拉何马市和北卡罗来纳州的大部分地区已被迫关门。海关关员奥马利估计，美国进口的儿童色情书刊近两年已降低了一半。一些地方性的电话公司也已禁止顾客利用他们的线路“听黄腔”。扫黄团体的一位成员麦盖迪说，“我们已经开始有干净的城市了。”
    美国扫黄之役得到各种团体的支持与合作，主张关闭各种色情商店的民间势力不断崛起并获得政府的大力支持。联邦政府新制定的扫黄法使侦办人员“如虎添翼”。去年秋天，国会通过的一项法律不但使色情案件容易起诉，而且修订了刑法，增加了禁止利用电脑为儿童色情书刊做广告的条款。各级法院、检察部门以前往往将色情案件束之高阁，现在能及时办案，速审速决了。
    布什总统曾说过，他的政府将致力“扫黄”，司法部长桑柏也早已是“扫黄”政策的拥护者。面对着一个日益张大的法网，美国有的色情商人已在开始考虑改行了。但美国要想扑灭色情文化，还有许许多多的困难。
