Recently, young worker Sun Fuyun was severely injured in a struggle with four thugs, and the First People's Hospital in Luoyang refused to treat him because he couldn't pay, resulting in Sun Fuyun dying in agony. After the newspaper exposed this incident, people widely condemned the hospital for lacking basic humanitarian spirit and called for the revival of humanity, sympathy, and a sense of justice.

Similar condemnations and calls for action are frequently heard. Last year, firefighter Liu Zuofa from Changde suffered 60% burns while saving property, and he fell into debt trying to pay for his treatment. People condemned and called for action then. To protect state property, a worker from Zhejiang, Zhu Guozhan, was stabbed in the eye by thugs, and when he couldn't get a disability certificate, people condemned and called for action.

However, yesterday's condemnations and calls for action did not prevent the tragedy of Sun Fuyun; therefore, today's condemnations and calls for action may not prevent tomorrow's "Sun Fuyun tragedy" from happening again. This means that if people only condemn and call for action, the decline in morality and the distortion of souls will be difficult to reverse.

Therefore, facing criminals, facing state property being destroyed by fire, and facing drowning victims, there will be more and more bystanders and fewer and fewer people who will stand up for justice.

It is a phenomenon that should not exist in our society that doing good deeds does not result in good returns, and this should be eliminated as soon as possible. Therefore, in addition to condemning some people's indifference and calling for the revival of humanity, it is urgent to establish an effective material protection system for those who stand up for justice. For example, establishing a fund to protect those who stand up for justice, providing material security for those who bravely protect state property and people's safety, and removing their worries, thus encouraging more people to stand up for justice.

This practical material security requires both social investment and public effort, and it cannot remain at the level of empty talk and creating public opinion.

Through efforts, we should establish a mechanism in our society: those who sacrifice for society and the people should receive good returns; conversely, those who harm society should receive bad returns at any time.

### 不能只是谴责和呼唤

　　不能只是谴责和呼唤
    陈秋中
    前不久，青年工人孙富君与四名歹徒搏斗被刺成重伤后，洛阳市第一人民医院认钱不救人，致使孙富君在剧烈的痛苦中离开人世。
    报纸披露此事后，人们纷纷谴责这家医院缺少起码的人道主义精神，呼唤人性的复苏，呼唤同情心，呼唤正义感。
    类似谴责、呼唤时有所闻。去年，救火勇士常德工人刘作发烧伤面积达６０％，为了治伤，他负债累累，陷入困境。对此，人们谴责过、呼唤过。为了保护国家财产，浙江工人朱国安被歹徒刺瞎一只眼睛，无处给他发放残废证时，人们也谴责过、呼唤过。
    但是，昨天的谴责和呼唤并没有避免孙富君悲剧的发生；那么，今天的谴责和呼唤也未必能使明天的“孙富君悲剧”不再重演。这就是说，如果人们仅仅只是谴责和呼唤，那么道德滑坡、灵魂被扭曲的现象是难以好转的。
    因而，面对着行凶作恶的歹徒，面对着被烈火吞噬的国家财产，面对着落水的遇难者，将是看客越来越多，见义勇为者越来越少。
    做了好事无好报是一种不该在我们社会中出现的怪现象，应尽早予以杜绝。所以，除了谴责某些人的冷漠、呼唤人性的复苏外，在对见义勇为者进行精神鼓励的同时，迫在眉睫的是建立一套行之有效的物质上的保护制度。例如，建立见义勇为者保护基金，为那些为保护国家财产和人民生命安全挺身而出的勇士们提供物质保障，解除他们后顾之忧，从而激励更多的人见义勇为。
    这种实实在在的物质保障，既需要社会投资，又需要群众出力，不能停留在讲空话、造舆论上。
    通过努力，在我们的社会中建立这样一种机制：凡是为社会为人民作出牺牲的人，都可以得到“善报”；相反，那些危害社会的不法之徒，随时受到恶报。
