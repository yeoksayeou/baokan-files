Xinhua News Agency, Islamabad, June 19th.

India and Pakistan issued a joint press release on the 17th in this city stating that, to ensure lasting peace in the Siachen region, both countries have agreed to use the Simla Agreement as a basis and to work through peaceful negotiations to fully resolve the Siachen Glacier issue.

The press release came after Indian Defense Secretary Chandra and Pakistani Defense Secretary Gerald Zaidi held a three-day meeting on the Siachen region dispute.

The press release stated that both sides agreed to fully resolve the Siachen issue, but it is necessary to "change the deployment of troops to reduce the possibility of conflict, avoid the use of force, and determine future ground positions."

The Siachen Glacier is located in the northern part of Kashmir, covering an area of 3,000 square kilometers. Both India and Pakistan claim sovereignty over this region. Since 1984, conflicts have frequently occurred in this area. According to reports, during a conflict in 1987, more than 100 people were killed.

The press release said that both sides have agreed that the next round of talks will be held soon in New Delhi, the capital of India.

　　印巴同意解决锡亚琴问题
    新华社伊斯兰堡６月１９日电  印度和巴基斯坦１７日在此间发表联合新闻公报说，为了保证锡亚琴地区的永久和平，印巴双方已同意以西姆拉协议为依据，通过和平谈判，为全面解决锡亚琴冰川问题而努力。
    印度国防秘书钱德拉和巴基斯坦国防秘书杰拉尔·扎伊迪举行了有关锡亚琴地区争端问题的三天会谈之后，发表了上述新闻公报。
    新闻公报说，双方同意全面解决锡亚琴问题，但必须“改变部队部署以减少发生冲突的可能性，避免使用武力以及确定今后在地面上据点”。
    锡亚琴冰川位于克什米尔北部，面积为３０００平方公里，印巴双方都声称对这一地区拥有主权。自１９８４年起，双方经常在这个地区发生冲突。据报道，在１９８７年的一次冲突中曾有１００多人被打死。
    新闻公报说，双方已商定，下一轮会谈不久将在印度首都新德里举行。
