One day last autumn, when police holding arrest warrants suddenly appeared at the door of retired accordion tuner Gikov's home, the 70-year-old man rushed to the drawer where he kept poison. In his panic, he tripped over a sofa and failed in his attempt to poison himself. This former Soviet Red Army traitor sensed that his end was near, so he grabbed his accordion and frantically played a dance tune...

In court, all of Gikov's crimes committed after he betrayed his country in 1942 were exposed. On May 5, the Moscow Military District sentenced him to death. The case caused a great stir in the Soviet Union.

Gikov was originally a soldier in the Soviet Red Army. In 1942, he was captured and defected, voluntarily joining the fascist extermination squad to fight against the partisans. Two months after his betrayal, he became a squad leader and quickly rose to the rank of lieutenant and deputy company commander. During his service to the fascists, Gikov actively participated in the suppression of the partisans, personally arresting, torturing, and killing many civilians. He once used an axe and bayonet to slaughter partisans like livestock. In a massacre he participated in, dozens of children in a kindergarten were burned alive. For his merits in the extermination campaign, Gikov received two medals from the fascists.

After the war, this butcher with blood on his hands hid his crimes and was imprisoned for a few years as an ordinary member of the extermination squad. After his release, he knew that the real danger had not passed, so he always carried poison with him, ready to commit suicide at any moment.

His profession was an accordion tuner, and his life was quite affluent. Ironically, he managed to obtain various benefits provided by the government to participants in the Great Patriotic War through connections, pretending to be an old soldier and a hero, swindling people everywhere. Later, his deception was exposed, and his benefits were revoked. This should have been a dangerous signal for him, but his greed did not diminish with age. He was indignant about the revocation of his veteran benefits and assumed that the direct witnesses to his crimes had all died, and the judicial authorities could not touch him. Thus, greed overcame fear, and he "justifiably" demanded that the authorities "fairly" resolve his issues and restore his benefits. As a result, he fell into his own trap and was imprisoned. The butcher finally received the punishment he deserved from history.

　　历史无情　叛徒遭惩
    去年秋季的一天，当手持逮捕证的警察突然出现在退休调琴师吉可夫家的门口时，７０老翁急忙扑向存放毒药的抽屉。惊慌之中，他绊倒在沙发上，服毒没得逞。这个当年苏联红军的叛徒预感到末日就在眼前，索性抓起手风琴，歇斯底里地拉起了舞曲……
    在法庭上，吉可夫在１９４２年投敌后犯下的全部罪行被一一揭露出来。今年５月５日，莫斯科军区对他做出极刑判决。该案在苏联引起极大的轰动。
    吉可夫原是苏联红军一名战士，１９４２年被俘投敌，自愿加入了法西斯讨伐队，与游击队作战。他叛变后两个月就当上了班长，很快又升为中尉副连长。在为法西斯效力期间，吉可夫积极参加了对游击队的围剿，亲自逮捕、拷打、枪杀了许多平民。他曾经用斧子、刺刀像屠宰牲口一样杀死游击队员。在他参与指挥的一次大屠杀中，一所幼儿园的几十名儿童全被活活烧死。因讨伐有功，吉可夫两次获得法西斯颁发的奖章。
    战后，这个双手沾满人民鲜血的刽子手隐瞒了自己的罪行，被当作普通讨伐队员坐了几年牢。出狱后，他深知真正的危险并未过去，因此随身带着毒药，时刻准备自杀。
    他的职业是调琴师，生活相当富裕。具有讽刺意味的是，他居然通过拉关系争取到了政府向卫国战争的参加者提供的各种优待，俨然以老兵和功臣的身份四处招摇撞骗。后来，他的欺骗行为败露，各种待遇被取消。这对他本是一个危险的信号，他却人老而贪心不衰，对取消他的老战士待遇忿忿不平。他自以为他的罪行的直接见证人早已死光，司法部门奈何他不得，于是贪心战胜了恐惧，居然“理直气壮”地向“刁难”他的人兴师问罪，一次次要求上级机关“公正”解决他的问题，恢复各种待遇。结果，弄巧成拙，锒铛入狱。刽子手终于受到历史的应有惩罚。
