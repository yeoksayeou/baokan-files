On the evening of June 24, senior leaders of the Armed Police General Headquarters watched the news of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party with great excitement and immediately convened an expanded meeting of the Party Committee to study and discuss the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session.

The comrades who participated in the study and discussion unanimously agreed: The Party Central Committee, at the crucial moment when the decisive victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots was achieved, convened this historic meeting, which shows that our Party is closely united and has fighting strength. The determination of the nature of the errors made by Comrade Zhao Ziyang is objective, and the decision to remove him from all his Party positions is very correct. We firmly support it. The adjustments made by the plenary session to the central leadership are very important and timely, representing the wishes of the broad Party members and expressing the voice of hundreds of millions of people.

Commander-in-Chief Li Lianxi said: The Party Central Committee convened this historic and crucial meeting at a critical moment for the Party and the state, made crucial decisions, and once again saved our Party and our country. This is another outstanding contribution by the older generation of revolutionaries led by Comrade Deng Xiaoping to our Party and nation. Zhang Xiufu, Political Commissar of the Armed Police Force, said: The Fourth Plenary Session fully affirmed the great contributions of the Armed Police Force in stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots, which is a great encouragement and motivation for our broad Armed Police officers and soldiers. The Armed Police Force will resolutely implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session and continue the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary riots to the end.
