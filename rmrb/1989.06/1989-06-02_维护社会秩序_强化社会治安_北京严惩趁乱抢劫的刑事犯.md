	Beijing Severely Punishes Criminals Who Exploit Chaos to Commit Robberies

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 2 — The Beijing Intermediate People's Court today sentenced the criminals Jin Wencheng, Zhang Jing (female), and Li Long to death for robbing a savings office during the chaos. Shi Zilong, who impersonated a student protester and robbed a driver at knifepoint, was sentenced to life imprisonment.

	On the evening of April 27, Jin Wencheng, Zhang Jing, and Li Long took advantage of the disorder caused by student protests and the resulting traffic chaos. They carried knives and broke into the Post and Telecommunications Institute branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Haidian District, stealing nearly 60,000 yuan. Before this incident, the three had conspired to commit robberies twice. In one instance, they broke into a resident's home and stole over 4,000 yuan. In another attempt to rob a savings office, they failed. To prepare for the bank robbery, they also conspired to steal firearms and ammunition but were thwarted by police dogs. Their actions constitute the crimes of robbery and theft of firearms and ammunition.

	Shi Zilong, who had fled from Sichuan to Beijing, impersonated a student protester on the evening of May 18 and boarded a van. Shortly after the vehicle started, he brandished a knife and demanded money from the driver. He was immediately subdued by the driver and handed over to the public security authorities. His actions constitute the crime of robbery.

    北京严惩趁乱抢劫的刑事犯
    新华社北京６月２日电  北京市中级人民法院今天判处趁乱抢劫储蓄所的罪犯金文成、张晶（女）、李龙男死刑，冒充游行学生、持械抢劫司机财物的石子龙被判处无期徒刑。
    今年４月２７日傍晚，金文成、张晶、李龙男乘大学生游行交通秩序混乱之机，携尖刀闯入中国工商银行海淀区办事处邮电学院储蓄所，抢走近６万元人民币。在此之前，他们３人还曾两次合谋抢劫，其中一次窜入居民家中抢走人民币４０００余元，另一次抢储蓄所未遂。为了准备抢劫银行的凶器，他们还合谋盗窃枪支、弹药，因警犬报警未逞。他们的行为已构成抢劫罪和盗窃枪支、弹药罪。
    从四川流窜到北京的石子龙在５月１８日晚，冒充游行学生搭乘一辆面包车，车启动不久，即持刀强索司机财物，当场被司机制服而扭送公安机关。其行为已构成抢劫罪。
