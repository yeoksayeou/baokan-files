Leading cadres' private housing construction must go through the reporting procedure. This is one of the measures taken by the Chongming County Committee and County Government of Shanghai to promote clean governance.

Chongming County stipulates that leading cadres' private housing construction, in addition to going through the normal approval procedures by the relevant business departments, must also undergo the reporting procedure. Party and government leaders at the county level and above must report to the county disciplinary commission, while administrative leaders must report to the county supervision bureau. Party and government leaders at the county level and above in the county committee and county government systems, as well as leaders in mass organizations, must report to the county disciplinary commission or supervision bureau according to their respective party and government affiliations.

It is understood that the main issues raised by the public regarding cadres' private housing construction include excessive floor area, misappropriation of collective funds, incomplete approval procedures, and the misuse or low-cost purchase of building materials. To address these issues, the county has stipulated that leading cadres must fill out a "Report Form" for private housing construction, providing detailed information on more than ten items, including the existing housing area. They must also fill out a "Report on the Preparation of Building Materials and Funds," explaining the sources of materials and the payment of funds. After the new housing is completed, the relevant leading cadres must submit the acceptance procedures, labor costs, transportation costs, and related expenses for materials added during the construction process to the receiving unit for record-keeping.

The reporting of cadres' private housing construction will be reviewed and analyzed by the disciplinary and supervisory departments. If there are any doubts, they will be resolved before the construction begins. If no problems are found, approval for construction will be notified. Those who violate the regulations or are found to have engaged in activities that harm public interests for private gain during the construction process will be immediately investigated and dealt with by the relevant authorities.

　　上海市崇明县廉政建设有措施：    
    干部建私房必须申报
    本报上海６月２９日电  领导干部私人建房必须履行申报手续，这是上海市崇明县委、县政府抓廉政建设的措施之一。
    崇明县规定，领导干部私人建房除由业务主管部门办理正常的审批手续外，必须一律履行申报手续。乡、镇、局党内正职领导干部向县纪委申报，行政正职领导干部向县监察局申报；县委、县政府系统的部委办和群众团体组织的正副职领导干部，按党政区分向县纪委或监察局申报。
    据了解，群众对干部私人建房的意见，主要集中在多占建筑面积、挪借、拖欠集体资金、批准手续不全、挪用或低价购买建筑材料等方面。为此，县里规定领导干部私人建房必须填写《申报表》，对现有房屋占地面积等１０多个类目作出详细说明，还须填写《建房物资材料筹备情况汇报表》，就材料来源及资金支付等情况作说明。新建房屋竣工之后，当事的领导干部应将验收手续、建房人工费、运输费开支及建房过程中添置材料的有关费用情况书面报告受理单位备案。
    对干部私人建房的申报，由纪检、监察等部门进行审核分析，有疑点的在建房前解决，没有发现问题的通知同意建房。
    凡违反规定或发现在建房中有损公肥私等行为的，将组织力量立即查处。
