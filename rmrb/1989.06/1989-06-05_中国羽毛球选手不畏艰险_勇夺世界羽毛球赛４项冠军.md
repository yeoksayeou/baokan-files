Chinese badminton athletes concluded the sixth World Badminton Championships here tonight, securing four gold medals excluding the mixed doubles. Yang Yang and Li Lingwei won the men's and women's singles titles, respectively, while Li Yongbo/Tian Bingyi and Lin Ying/Guan Weizhen took the men's and women's doubles titles. Among these, the champions of men's singles, men's doubles, and women's doubles were all defending champions from the previous tournament. Li Lingwei claimed her second women's singles crown.

Huang Hua, Chen Kang/Chen Hongyong also won the silver medals in women's singles and men's doubles, respectively.

South Korea's Park Joo-bong/Jung Myung-hee and Indonesia's Hong Chong-Mid/Verawati won the gold and silver medals in the mixed doubles.

The most thrilling and exciting match of the night was the final between Yang Yang and Indonesia's 19-year-old Adi. In the first set, Yang Yang struggled with his net play, falling behind 0-7. However, as a seasoned player, he focused on defending the backcourt and capitalized on opportunities to jump and smash, eventually winning the set 15-10. In the second set, Adi exploited Yang Yang's weak backhand and poor net play, quickly leading 8-2. Yang Yang, conserving his energy, lost the set 2-15. In the decisive set, Yang Yang launched a relentless attack on Adi's forehand and combined it with soft drops, comfortably winning 15-5 to defend his title. Adi finished second.

Lin Ying/Guan Weizhen utilized quick net play and powerful smashes to keep South Korea's Jung Myung-hee/Hwang Hye-young on the defensive throughout the match. They won with scores of 15-1 and 15-7. The South Korean pair took the silver medal.

Both the women's singles and men's doubles finals were contested between Chinese players. Li Lingwei defeated Huang Hua 11-6, 12-9, and Li Yongbo/Tian Bingyi defeated Chen Kang/Chen Hongyong 15-3, 15-12.

The second Sudirman Cup World Mixed Team Championships and the seventh World Badminton Championships will be held in Copenhagen, Denmark, sometime between February 29 and May 17, 1991.

　　中国羽毛球选手不畏艰险
    勇夺世界羽毛球赛４项冠军
    新华社雅加达６月４日电  （记者梁金雄、周宗欣）中国羽球健儿今晚在这里结束的第六届世界羽毛球锦标赛上，获得了除混合双打以外的四块金牌。
    杨阳、李玲蔚分获男、女单打冠军，李永波／田秉毅、林瑛／关渭贞分获男、女双打冠军。其中，获男单、男双和女双冠军的均为上届冠军得主。李玲蔚是第二次摘得女单桂冠。
    黄华、陈康／陈红勇还夺得女单、男双亚军。
    南朝鲜的朴柱奉／郑明熙和印尼的洪忠中／维拉华蒂分获混合双打冠、亚军。
    今晚最为紧张、精彩的比赛要数杨阳同印尼１９岁的阿迪的决赛。首局，杨阳因网前处理不好，曾以零比七落后，但他不愧为一员老将，坚持打后场，一有机会便跳起扣杀，反以１５∶１０先下一分。第二局，阿迪抓住杨阳反手差、网前球不好的弱点，很快以８∶２领先。杨阳为保存体力，以２∶１５让对方扳回一分。决胜局杨阳猛攻阿迪后场正手并结合轻吊，轻松地以１５∶５卫冕成功。阿迪名列第二。
    林瑛／关渭贞以快速上网封杀和凶猛劈杀，使南朝鲜的郑明熙／黄惠英始终处于守势。最后以１５∶１和１５比７获胜。南朝鲜选手获得亚军。
    女单和男双决赛都是在中国选手之间进行的。结果，李玲蔚以１１∶６、１２∶９胜黄华，李永波／田秉毅以１５∶３、１５∶１２胜陈康／陈红勇。
    第二届苏迪曼杯世界混合团体赛和第七届世界羽毛球锦标赛将于１９９１年２月２９日至５月１７日之间的某个时期在丹麦的哥本哈根举行。
