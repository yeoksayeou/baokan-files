Communication Freedom Should Be Protected

Editor:

I am a student from the Humanities Class of Grade 12 at Datong No. 1 Middle School in Shanxi Province and the chairman of the student union. I would like to bring to your attention an important issue: the long-term neglect of students' letters, leading to frequent incidents of letters being lost, torn, or opened.

In this information age, middle school students are no longer "bookworms" who are oblivious to the world outside. They need to exchange information with their peers, which has led to an increase in letter exchanges among students. However, during my two years as the chairman of the student union, I have repeatedly heard complaints from students about their letters being lost, torn, or opened. They have asked the student union to address this issue to protect their legitimate rights.

What causes this situation? Over the past two years, using my spare time and holidays, I conducted a survey of nearly 20 middle schools in the city. The findings are as follows:

First, schools have long neglected the management of students' mail. Most schools have a long wooden slot nailed to the wall of the school's mailroom, where students' letters are placed. Some schools simply put the received letters on the windowsill of the mailroom, leaving students to take them as they please. It is easy to see that this method has many flaws. In the summer, rain can soak the letters, making the handwriting illegible; in the winter, snow can cover the letters, and when the snow melts, the ink runs, making the handwriting unreadable. Sometimes, a strong wind can blow away and lose the letters.

Second, due to the widespread use of the above-mentioned improper management methods, some students with weak legal awareness have found opportunities to take advantage. Some stamp collectors, seeing good stamps on others' letters, tear off a corner or take the entire letter. Some students who enjoy spreading rumors and prying into others' secrets open others' letters to achieve their trivial goals. Others, harboring grudges against their classmates, take and tear up their letters to vent their anger.

The school's irresponsible management of students' letters has caused students significant mental stress, affecting their normal studies. During my survey, I witnessed an incident: in front of a school's mailroom, there was a small blackboard with the message, "Who took XX's letter? It contains a prescription for his mother's medicine, which is urgently needed. Please return it, and there will be a reward!" One can imagine that a student facing such a situation would not be able to concentrate on their studies.

In light of this, I began to fulfill my duties:

I have repeatedly discussed this issue with the school administration, but it has not been resolved. The school either says they are too busy or that one person's opinion is not enough, and it needs to be discussed in a meeting. However, there has been no result so far. Then I thought of the media, hoping they could appeal to schools and society to solve this problem. I have also written to radio stations and newspapers multiple times, and they have sent reporters to investigate, but afterward, there was no news, and students' letters continued to be lost, torn, or opened. To ensure safety, letters need to be registered or sent to the students' parents' units, which adds many inconveniences.

Frankly, as a senior student leader, I feel guilty for not being able to do something practical for the students before graduating and leaving middle school. I regret my inability to protect students' interests and am also saddened by the existence of certain bureaucratic practices in society.

With the last bit of hope, I use this space in your newspaper to appeal to society and schools: please protect students' communication freedom!

### 通信自由应当受到保护

　　通信自由应当受到保护
    编辑同志：
    我是山西省大同一中高三文科班学生，是学生会主席。我在这里向你们反映一个重要问题，即中学生的信件长期不被重视，丢失、被撕、被拆现象严重。
    在当今信息时代，中学生已不再是“死读圣贤书、不闻窗外事”的书呆子，他们要和同龄人进行信息交流，因而中学生间的信件交往越来越频繁。但是，在我任学生会主席的两年里，不断有同学反映信件丢失、被撕、被拆的情况，他们要求学生会处理这个问题，以维护他们的正当权益。
    造成这种现象的原因是什么呢？我利用课余、节假日时间，在近两年的时间里对全市２０多所中学进行了调查，其情况如下：
    一、长期以来，学校对学生信件收发工作管理不善。多数是在学校传达室的窗前钉一个长木槽子，把学生的信放在里边。有的学校干脆就把收到的学生信件放在传达室的窗台上，任凭学生自选自拿。可想而知，这种办法本身就存在很多漏洞。夏天遇雨，信件被淋湿，字迹无法辨认；冬天下雪，信件被雪花掩盖，雪融后字迹洇水，也无法辨认。有时遇到一阵狂风，常有信件被刮走丢失。
    二、由于上述欠妥的管理办法的普遍存在，给一些法制观念淡薄的学生创造了可乘之机。有些集邮的学生，见到别人信件上有好的邮票，便撕下一角或干脆将信拿走。有些平时爱搞小广播、好打听别人隐私的学生，为达到无聊的目的，便猜测着偷看别人的信件。还有的因同学间有成见，一见有对方的信，便拿走撕掉，以泄私愤。
    上述学校对学生信件不负责任的管理办法，给学生造成了一定的精神负担，影响了学生的正常学习。我在调查中曾目睹过这样一件事：某校传达室前立着一块小黑板，上面写着“谁拿了××的信件，里面有为其母亲治病的药方，急等着用，望归还，重谢！”可以想象，一个学生遇上这种事情，学习能安心吗？
    鉴于此，我开始履行我的职责：
    我曾就这个问题多次找校方商议，但一直得不到解决。学校或说顾不上，或说一人说了不算，需在会上研究研究。但始终没有结果。于是我想起新闻单位，希望他们能向学校、社会呼吁，解决这个问题。我也曾多次投书电台、报社，他们也曾派记者来调查过，但过后杳无音信，学生的信件还是依旧丢失，被撕毁、被拆看。以求保险，信要用挂号，或寄到学生父母单位，这就增加了许多麻烦。
    坦率地讲，我作为一名高年级学生干部，在即将毕业离开中学前，没能为学生做点切实的事情深感有愧，为无力维护学生的利益而遗憾，也为社会上某些官僚主义作风的存在而感到痛心。
    我怀着最后一线希望，借贵报一角，向社会、向学校发出呼吁：保护一下学生的通信自由吧！
