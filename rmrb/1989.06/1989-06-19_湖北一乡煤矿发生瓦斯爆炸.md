Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 18th.

On the afternoon of June 15, a gas explosion occurred at a coal mine in Gutiang Town, Xianning City, Hubei Province, resulting in the deaths of 18 miners and injuries to one person. By 10 PM on the 17th, rescue teams had found 17 bodies.

The Gutiang Town coal mine was originally under the jurisdiction of the Gutiang Town government but was contracted out to an individual entrepreneur, Wang Jinyi, from Chongyang County, in January of this year. The miners were recruited from Chongyang County, and among the deceased were fathers and sons, brothers, and brothers-in-law. Preliminary investigations indicate that the main cause of the accident was poor ventilation equipment in the mine, leading to a gas explosion.

The specific causes of the accident are still under further investigation.

    古田乡煤矿原隶属古田乡政府，今年元月承包给崇阳县个体业主王进义。矿工是由他从崇阳县招来，死者中有的是父子，有的是兄弟、连襟关系。经初步检测，这次事故主要是矿井里通风设备差，造成瓦斯爆炸。
