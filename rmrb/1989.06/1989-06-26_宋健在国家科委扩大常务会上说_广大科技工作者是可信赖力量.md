Song Jian, State Councilor and Minister of the State Science and Technology Commission, said today while discussing the study of the documents from the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party that from recent events, we are once again glad to see that the vast majority of scientific and technological workers across the country have not let down the expectations of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the people of the entire nation. Practice has proven that, except for a very small number of diehards who stubbornly adhere to a bourgeois stance, the vast majority of scientific and technological workers are and will forever be the pillar force for the progress and development of the Chinese nation, a force that the Party and the people can completely rely on.

He said, scientific conscience tells us that nature has destined us to be born on this land, and our sacred mission is to forever struggle together with the people here, to worry before the people worry and to be happy after the people are happy, to contribute all our wisdom, abilities, and lives to our people. Believing that scientific and technological workers will continue to strive unremittingly on the main battlefield of economic construction, in high-tech research and development, and in basic science at three levels, we will make our People's Republic stand tall among the nations of the world in the wave of the new technological revolution.

Comrade Song Jian made these remarks at the enlarged standing committee meeting of the State Science and Technology Commission. Other leading members of the State Science and Technology Commission and some old comrades who have worked at the commission attended the meeting. Everyone unanimously expressed their heartfelt support for the various decisions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Party and will work hard to complete the four tasks proposed by the plenary session.

　　宋健在国家科委扩大常务会上说    
    广大科技工作者是可信赖力量
    据新华社北京６月２６日电（记者卓培荣）国务委员兼国家科委主任宋健今天在畅谈学习党的十三届四中全会文件时指出，从最近发生的事情中我们再一次高兴地看到，全国绝大多数科技工作者没有辜负党中央、国务院和全国人民的期望。实践证明，除了极少数顽固坚持资产阶级立场的败类外，绝大部分科技工作者都将是而且永远是中华民族进步和发展的支柱力量，是党和人民完全可以信赖的力量。
    他说，科学的良知告诉我们，大自然安排我们出生在这块土地上，就注定我们的神圣使命是永远和这里的人民在一起艰苦奋斗，先天下之忧而忧，后天下之乐而乐，为我们的人民贡献出我们的一切智慧、能力和生命。相信科技工作者将继续不懈在经济建设主战场、高技术研究开发和基础科学三个层次上努力奋斗，使我们的人民共和国在新技术革命的浪潮中屹立于世界民族之林。
    宋健同志是在国家科委扩大常务会上讲这些话的。国家科委其他领导成员和一些在科委工作过的老同志参加了会议。大家一致表示衷心拥护党的十三届四中全会的各项决定，为完成全会提出的四项任务努力工作。
