Chinese artists holding exhibitions in Japan has become a common occurrence, and it is difficult to create a sensation. Currently, Professor Qiao Shiguang from the Central Academy of Arts and Design in Beijing is exhibiting lacquer paintings at the Japan-China Friendship Association, which has stirred up waves of interest. The impact has gone beyond the Japanese art world, causing those who pride themselves on being at the pinnacle of lacquer art to feel quite shaken.

Lacquer comes from the lacquer tree. It is commonly used to make lacquerware. The exchange of lacquerware techniques between China and Japan has a long history. The book "Hui Shi Lu" by Huang Dacheng of the Ming Dynasty is considered a rare treasure in Japan. Today, Japan produces a vast amount of lacquerware, which is exquisite in craftsmanship, deeply researched, but still no one has created lacquer paintings to enter the art hall.

Qiao Shiguang is currently the president of the Beijing Lacquer Art Research Association. In the early 1960s, he began researching lacquer paintings, and his skills have become increasingly refined. Lacquer paintings were included in the category of fine arts in 1984, fulfilling his wish. Lacquer paintings use gold powder, copper foil, seashells, and other materials. After painting, lacquer is applied, and after drying and polishing, the painting is completed. It can exhibit styles similar to woodblock prints, ink paintings, oil paintings, and murals, each with a distinct flavor, and it has its unique charm. Japanese people are fond of the quiet elegance of lacquer, and lacquer paintings naturally resonate with them. Patterns can also be created on lacquerware, but they found that lacquer paintings are created on a flat surface of the painting board, while patterns on lacquerware are created in concave areas. Lacquer paintings and patterns on lacquerware are indeed created using different techniques. Viewers admire Qiao Shiguang for using ancient Eastern lacquer to blaze a new trail, adding a unique flower to the garden of art.

　　古漆新花
    本报记者  于青
    中国人在日本举办画展终年不断，已难有轰动效应。目前，北京中央工艺美术学院教授乔十光在日中友好会馆展出漆画，荡起一阵涟漪，波及范围超出日本美术界，使一向自诩位居漆艺峰巅的日本人颇受冲击。
    漆，出自漆树。常见用于制作漆器。中日两国漆器技艺交流历史悠久，明代人士黄大成论述漆技专著《髹饰录》在日本视为稀世之宝。当今日本漆器产量庞多，制作精美，研究深入，但至今尚无人制作漆画，步入艺术殿堂。
    乔十光现任北京漆艺研究会会长。６０年代初开始研究漆画，技艺日臻完美。漆画１９８４年列入美术种类，乔氏如愿以偿。漆画以金粉、铜片、贝壳等为原料，画后涂漆，经风干、打磨成画。能现出近似木刻、水墨画、油画和壁画等迥然不同风格，又独具韵味。日本人钟情于漆的幽静典雅，漆画自然引起共鸣。漆器上也能作出图案，但他们发现，漆画作于画板平面，漆器图案作于凹处，漆画与漆器上的图案，竟出于不同手法。观画者赞叹乔十光以东方古漆，另辟蹊径，为艺术园地再添奇葩。
