Title: Will the U.S. Economy Experience a "Soft Landing"?

The U.S. economy has been in a recovery phase since the end of 1982, lasting 80 months, making it the longest post-war peacetime recovery. However, the growth momentum of the U.S. economy has significantly slowed in the first half of this year: the growth rate of the non-agricultural sector in the first quarter was only 1.9%, far below the 3.5% growth rate of the fourth quarter of last year. Recently, several key economic indicators have been fluctuating. Most economists here analyze that the U.S. economy is heading towards a "soft landing," maintaining low-speed growth without inflation getting out of control, and at least in the short term, it will not fall into a recession.

The accuracy of this assessment remains to be seen. However, the U.S. economy has indeed entered a "delicate" period of low-speed growth. On one hand, agricultural production has rapidly recovered, exports have increased, and corporate fixed capital investment has risen. On the other hand, personal consumption demand is weak, and the crucial automobile and construction industries have shrunk. As for the much-watched inflation issue, the consumer price index growth rate for the first five months of this year reached 6.7% annually, higher than the 4.4% level of last year. This shows that inflation has not reached an uncontrollable level.

To some extent, the current state of the U.S. economy is due to the monetary policy of the Federal Reserve. Due to the increasing pressure of inflation, the Federal Reserve has further adopted a tight monetary policy this year to curb social credit demand, thereby achieving the goal of cooling down the economy. In practice, the Federal Reserve has largely succeeded, but it has also played a role in the recent rise of the dollar's exchange rate. The rise of the dollar's exchange rate will inevitably hinder the U.S. efforts to further improve its severely imbalanced foreign trade situation.

Although the White House is optimistic about the economic development prospects, it is also concerned about the current slowdown, as a too rapid slowdown may lead to an economic recession. It is out of this concern that the Bush administration has repeatedly urged the Federal Reserve to appropriately ease credit, without too much concern about inflation. The federal funds rate slightly decreased in early June, but the Federal Reserve did not lower the discount rate despite commercial banks lowering their preferential rates at the beginning of the month. This shows that the White House and the Federal Reserve are still not well-coordinated in monetary policy.

It seems that whether the U.S. economy will experience a "soft landing" depends on the government and the Federal Reserve's regulatory capabilities. Due to the balanced budget law restricting the use of fiscal measures, the authorities can only rely on monetary measures. In this regard, although the Federal Reserve's maneuvering space is limited, its regulatory capabilities should not be underestimated. In addition, the policy coordination mechanism established by the Group of Seven is also a favorable external factor. If some links malfunction, they will cooperate with each other to eliminate them without damaging their fundamental interests. Therefore, the U.S. economy is likely to experience a "soft landing," but achieving this will not be easy.

　　美国经济会“软着陆”吗
    本报记者  张亮
    美国经济自１９８２年底开始复苏以来已持续了８０个月，是战后和平时期最长的一次。然而，今年上半年美国经济的增长势头已明显减弱：第一季度非农业部门的增长率仅为１．９％，远低于去年第四季度３．５％的增长水平；近时期公布的多项关键经济指标起伏不稳。此间多数经济专家据此分析，美国经济趋向“软着陆”，即在通货膨胀不致失控下继续保持低速增长，至少在短期内不会陷入衰退。
    这种估计的准确性究竟如何，看来还尚待进一步观察。但是，美国经济目前确实进入一个低速增长的“微妙”时期。一方面，农业生产迅速恢复，出口增加，企业固定资本投资上升。而另一方面，个人消费需求不旺，至关重要的汽车工业和建筑业萎缩。至于众所瞩目的通货膨胀问题，今年头５个月消费物价指数增长的年率达６．７％，高于去年４．４％的水平。由此可见，通货膨胀并未达到失控的地步。
    在一定程度上来说，美国经济出现这种状况是由于联邦储备委员会的货币政策所致。由于通货膨胀的压力增大，联邦储备委员会今年进一步采取了紧缩银根政策，以抑制社会信贷需求，进而达到使经济降温之目的。实践证明，联邦储备委员会基本上如愿以偿，但同时也为美元汇价近期上涨起了推波助澜的作用。而美元汇价的上涨势必妨碍美国进一步改善其外贸严重失衡状况的努力。
    尽管白宫对经济发展前景表示乐观，但对目前的减缓速度也不无忧虑，因为减得太猛有可能导致经济衰退。正是出于这种担心，布什政府一再敦促联邦储备委员会适当放松信贷，不必太多顾虑通货膨胀。联邦资金利率６月初略有下降，但是在商业银行本月初降低优惠利率的情况下，联邦储备委员会并未减低贴现率。这说明白宫与联邦储备委员会在货币政策上仍然不大协调。
    看来，美国经济是否会“软着陆”关键取决于政府和联邦储备委员会的调节能力。由于平衡预算法束缚了使用财政手段的手脚，当局只能依赖货币手段。在这方面，联邦储备委员会的回旋余地虽然有限，但其调节能力不能低估。另外，西方七国集团建立的政策协调机制也是一个有利的外部因素。如果某些环节出现故障，它们便会在不损害自身根本利益的前提下相互协作，加以排除。因此，美国经济很可能会“软着陆”，但要做到这一点并非易事。
