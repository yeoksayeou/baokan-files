The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPCCC) recently organized a study session for members of the 14 specialized committees to thoroughly learn from Deng Xiaoping's speech during his meeting with senior military officers of the Beijing martial law troops.

On June 15, Wang Renhe, vice chairman of the CPCCC and a member of the CPCCC Party Group, convened a meeting of the deputy directors of the 14 specialized committees of the CPCCC to convey and study Deng Xiaoping's speech. Wang Renhe said, "The struggle to quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing is a matter of the survival of the Party and the state. As Comrade Xiaoping said, this disturbance was bound to happen, determined by both the international climate and China's own domestic conditions. I believe that the international and domestic climates are essentially the same, that is, hostile forces both domestically and internationally want to overthrow socialism and the leadership of the Communist Party. This is something we cannot accept. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference is a broad patriotic united front organization in our country, supporting the leadership of the Communist Party of China and socialism is the political foundation of the CPCCC, as stipulated in the CPCCC Charter. At this critical moment of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the Party Central Committee and the State Council took decisive measures to quell the rebellion, which is entirely correct."

Wang Renhe said, "Comrade Xiaoping's speech elucidates the causes, nature, and policies of the central government regarding this rebellion, and also points out that the policies of reform and opening up will not change, and the Four Cardinal Principles will not change. On this, the vast majority of our CPCCC members have a clear understanding. It is not surprising that some people have different thoughts. He urged the specialized committees of the CPCCC to organize the members' study well, and through study, to unify their thoughts with Comrade Xiaoping's speech. They should also do more work with the various circles they are connected with, to play their role in thoroughly quelling this rebellion and maintaining a stable and united political situation."

The 14 specialized committees of the CPCCC have over 400 members and are connected with nearly 900 more members. According to the unified arrangement, they have recently begun to organize study and discussion. During the study, the specialized committees pay attention to carrying forward the fine traditions of the CPCCC, implementing the principle of voluntarism, promoting democracy, and speaking freely, "not pulling hair, not labeling, not beating," and through democratic discussion to improve understanding and unify thoughts. At the same time, in the spirit of "sharing joys and sorrows," they welcome members to criticize and suggest improvements to the work.

　　全国政协组织学习邓小平讲话    
    要求各专门委员会为维护安定团结多做工作
    新华社北京６月２０日电  全国政协党组最近组织政协１４个专门委员会的委员认真学习邓小平同志在接见首都戒严部队军以上干部时的讲话。
    全国政协党组副书记、政协副主席王任重于６月１５日召集全国政协各专门委员会常务副主任会议，传达学习了邓小平同志的讲话。王任重说，平息北京发生的反革命暴乱的斗争，是关系党和国家存亡的大问题，正如小平同志讲的，这场风波迟早要来，这是国际的大气候和中国自己的小气候所决定了的。我看，大气候、小气候，就是一个气候，就是国内外的敌对势力要推翻社会主义，要推翻共产党的领导。这是我们坚决不能答应的。人民政协是我国的广泛的爱国统一战线组织，拥护中国共产党的领导、拥护社会主义是人民政协的政治基础，这是写在政协章程里的。在反革命暴乱的关键时刻，党中央、国务院采取果断措施，平息了暴乱，是完全正确的。
    王任重说，邓小平同志的讲话，阐述了这场暴乱的起因、性质和中央的方针，也指出了今后的改革、开放政策不变，四个坚持不变。对此，我们政协绝大多数委员的认识是清楚的，有的人有些想法也不奇怪。他要求政协各专门委员会把委员的学习组织好，通过学习，把思想统一到小平同志讲话的精神上来。并且要向所联系的各方面人士多做工作，为彻底平息这场暴乱，维护安定团结的政治局面，发挥自己的作用。
    全国政协１４个专门委员会有委员４００多人，并联系近９００多位委员。根据统一安排，近日已陆续开始组织学习讨论。学习中，各专门委员会注意发扬人民政协的优良传统，贯彻自愿原则，发扬民主，畅所欲言，“不抓辫子，不扣帽子，不打棍子”，通过民主讨论的方法提高认识，统一思想。同时，本着“肝胆相照，荣辱与共”的精神，欢迎委员们对工作提出批评与建议。
