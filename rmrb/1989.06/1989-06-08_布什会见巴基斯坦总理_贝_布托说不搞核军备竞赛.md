    **Bush Meets with Pakistani Prime Minister**

    **Benazir Bhutto Says No to Nuclear Arms Race**

    Our correspondent in Washington reported today that U.S. President Bush met with Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto, who is on an official visit to the United States. They held extensive discussions on related issues. Both leaders agreed that the talks were fruitful and beneficial to the development of bilateral relations.

    During the talks, both sides reviewed the situation in Afghanistan, noting that after the withdrawal of Soviet troops, the situation in Afghanistan had undergone welcome changes. However, the task of political resolution has not been completed. Both sides will continue to seek solutions to establish a non-aligned, representative government. Both sides also reviewed the efforts made by the U.S. and Pakistan for the stability of South Asia. Bush reiterated that the United States is responsible for the security and economic development of Pakistan and expressed support for the efforts made by Pakistan and India to improve their mutual relations. Benazir Bhutto stated that Pakistan will continue to work for the promotion of peace in South Asia.

    After the talks, the leaders of both countries made speeches at the White House.

    Our correspondent in Washington reported on June 8th that Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto announced in a speech to a joint session of the U.S. Congress that "Pakistan does not possess and does not intend to manufacture nuclear devices." She also stated that Pakistan will not initiate a nuclear arms race on the Indian subcontinent and proposed that Pakistan and its neighboring countries conclude a treaty banning nuclear tests as a first step towards making Southeast Asia a nuclear-free zone.

    Benazir Bhutto also called on the United States to continue supporting the Afghan resistance forces, along with Pakistan, in their ongoing struggle for self-determination.
