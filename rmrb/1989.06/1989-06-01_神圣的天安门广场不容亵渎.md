The Sacred Tiananmen Square Must Not Be Profaned

On the morning of May 30, a statue of some "goddess" suddenly appeared in Tiananmen Square. This is a blatant violation of the law, a defiance of public opinion, and a profanation of the sacred sentiments of the people. The people of the capital have expressed strong discontent over this.

Tiananmen Square is a sacred place revered and admired by all ethnic groups in our country. On October 1, 1949, standing before a crowd of a million people in the square, Comrade Mao Zedong solemnly proclaimed: "The Chinese people have stood up." Since then, Tiananmen Square has become a symbol of the People's Republic of China and a symbol of the victory of the Chinese people's revolution. Whenever people think of Tiananmen Square, they will inevitably recall the arduous revolutionary struggles of the Chinese people under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and they will inevitably pay tribute to the countless martyrs who sacrificed their lives for the establishment of the republic. Grand celebrations for May Day and National Day, as well as welcoming ceremonies for foreign heads of state, are all held in Tiananmen Square. People from all over the country, and even from around the world, come to Tiananmen Square to pay their respects and take photographs. Tiananmen Square is also an important venue for educating young people and children about revolutionary traditions. Even kindergarten children sing "I Love Beijing Tiananmen." Tiananmen Square belongs to all the people of the country.

In recent times, the Tiananmen Square, which belongs to the people, has become the domain of a few individuals. Some people have been sitting in the square for long periods, seriously damaging the image of Tiananmen Square and severely disrupting the normal sightseeing and paying of respects. The calls to restore the normal order of Tiananmen Square have grown louder. However, at this critical moment, some people, disregarding the feelings of the people and defying the will of the people, have shamelessly erected a statue of some "goddess" in the solemn and sacred Tiananmen Square. This behavior has, of course, aroused the indignation of the broad masses of the people.

Any construction and facilities in Tiananmen Square are built according to the will of the people, through legal procedures, and with the approval of relevant departments. The Monument to the People's Heroes standing in the square was decided by the First Plenary Session of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1949 and was chaired by Comrade Zhou Enlai. The Chairman Mao Memorial Hall was built in 1976 with the joint decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission. To ensure the solemnity, dignity, cleanliness, and good social order of Tiananmen Square, the Beijing Municipal People's Government has clear regulations: "It is forbidden to engage in any activities in Tiananmen Square that damage the national reputation, disrupt public order, endanger public safety, or affect the city's appearance." Any facilities in Tiananmen Square that have not gone through legal procedures and have not been approved by relevant departments are illegal. It is absolutely not allowed for anyone to set up any sculptures or facilities in the square for any reason. Imagine if everyone could set up facilities at will, what would the sacred Tiananmen Square look like?

The erection of the goddess statue shows how serious the anarchist behavior of some people has become. These people, who shout about democracy and the rule of law, repeatedly destroy democracy and the rule of law in their actions. This also shows that the so-called democracy they want is not the socialist democracy based on the rule of law, but an anarchism that rejects any discipline and order. The disorder in Beijing has lasted for more than a month, and with the efforts of the Party, the government, and the broad masses of the people, the situation is gradually stabilizing. However, these people, disregarding the advice of the Party and the government and the opposition of the masses, insist on erecting the goddess statue, attempting to make the gradually stabilizing situation chaotic again. This is something the broad masses of the people do not want to see.

People from all walks of life have sent telegrams and letters, strongly demanding that relevant departments stop the illegal behavior of erecting the goddess statue. We hope that relevant departments will follow the will of the people, persuade, and even use legal means to remove the goddess statue erected in the square.

### 神圣的天安门广场不容亵渎

　　神圣的天安门广场不容亵渎
    ５月３０日晨，天安门广场突然冒出一个什么女神像。这是公然违反法律规定、违背民意、亵渎人民神圣情感的行为。首都人民对此表示强烈不满。
    天安门广场是我国各族人民向往、景仰的神圣地方。１９４９年１０月１日，面对广场百万群众，毛泽东同志庄严宣告：中国人民从此站起来了。从那以后，天安门广场成为中华人民共和国的象征，成为中国人民革命胜利的象征。每当人们想起天安门广场，就一定会想起中国人民在中国共产党的领导下所进行的艰苦卓绝的革命斗争，就一定会缅怀为共和国的创立而牺牲的无数先烈。庆祝“五一”、“十一”的盛大集会，接待外国元首的欢迎仪式都在天安门广场举行，全国范围乃至世界各国来京的人士都会到天安门广场瞻仰、留影。天安门广场也是对青少年儿童进行革命传统教育的重要场所，幼儿园的孩子都会唱“我爱北京天安门”。天安门广场是属于全国各族人民的。
    最近一个时期，属于人民的天安门广场变成了一些人的天下。有些人长期在此静坐，严重损害了天安门广场的形象，严重干扰了天安门广场的正常观光和瞻仰。要求恢复天安门广场正常秩序的呼声越来越高。然而正值此际，一些人竟然不顾人民的感情，违背人民的意愿，在庄严神圣的天安门广场，为所欲为地立起一个什么女神像。这种行为，理所当然地激起广大人民的义愤。
    天安门广场上的任何建筑和设施，是按照全国人民的意愿，经过一定的法律程序，得到有关部门的批准而建立的。矗立在广场内的人民英雄纪念碑，是１９４９年第一届全国政协会议郑重决定建立的，由周恩来同志任筹建委员会主任。毛主席纪念堂，是１９７６年经中共中央、人大常委会、国务院、中央军委共同决定建立的。为了保证天安门广场的庄严、肃穆、整洁和良好的社会秩序，北京市人民政府有明确的规定：“禁止在天安门广场进行任何形式的有损国家声誉、扰乱公共秩序、妨碍公共安全、有碍市容观瞻的一切活动。”在天安门广场内，凡是未经法律程序，未经有关部门批准的任何设施都是违法的。绝不允许任何人以任何理由在广场搞什么雕塑设施。不妨设想，如果人人都可以随心所欲地搞设施，神圣的天安门广场将会成为什么样子？
    女神像的树立，表明一些人目无法纪的无政府主义行为发展到了何等严重的地步。这些人口口声声喊要民主、要法制，可在行动上却一而再、再而三地破坏民主与法制。这也说明，他们要的所谓民主，并不是建立在法制基础上的社会主义民主，而是不要任何纪律、任何秩序的无政府主义。北京秩序的混乱已经持续了一个多月，在党和政府以及广大人民群众的努力下，局势正趋于平稳。而这些人不顾党和政府的劝说，不顾人民群众的反对，执意树起什么女神像，企图使逐渐平稳的局势又混乱起来，这是广大人民群众绝不愿意看到的。
    各界人士已纷纷致电发函，强烈要求有关部门制止树立女神像的违法行为。我们希望有关部门遵循民意，劝说乃至用法律的手段拆除树立在广场上的女神像。
