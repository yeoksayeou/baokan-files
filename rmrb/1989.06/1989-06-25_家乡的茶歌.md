Title: The Tea Songs of My Hometown

It has been a long time since I last heard the tea songs of my hometown.

The car was still winding through the mountainous roads, but my heart had already flown over the hills and valleys back to my hometown.

My hometown is located in the middle section of the Dabie Mountains, where the mountains are high and the soil is fertile, with clouds nesting and mist nurturing. It is a famous tea-producing region. I remember that during the tea-picking season, the young women of the mountains, dressed in red jackets and green pants with red strings tied to the ends of their braids, would carry bamboo baskets and go up the mountains in groups to pick tea. From a distance, they seemed like red flowers scattered among the green hills, or like bundles of flickering flames. They would sing tea songs while picking tea, sometimes taking turns, sometimes leading and following. The beautiful melodies would be carried by the wind, drifting from one hill to another.

The tea songs of my hometown are mostly in four-word and eight-sentence verses, simple and easy to understand. It takes only a few puffs of a cigarette to come up with a verse, but they almost encompass all emotions. There are passionate and unrestrained ones, soft and sweet ones, delicate and tender ones, and high-pitched and deep ones...

In my hometown, tea songs are not just sung during the tea-picking season; there is singing all the time. Not just the tea-picking girls sing, but also the old men working in the fields, the women washing clothes by the river, the naked children rolling on the backs of cows, and the young men twisting ropes and making cords under the old locust trees—everyone can sing a few verses! Interestingly, whenever there is a wedding, a birth, or any other joyous event in the village, the head of the household would always select a few singers to sing tea songs to add to the festivity. Even more interestingly, after the villagers finish their New Year's meal, the most important thing to do is to practice singing. They sing as they go out and hum as they come in, never leaving the songs from their lips. This is because every year during the Rainy Season, the village holds a tea song competition, just like the dragon boat races in the water towns during the Dragon Boat Festival.

On that day, relatives from near and far would come to the village, and along with the crowds from the surrounding villages who came to watch the spectacle, the whole village would be in a frenzy! The stage for the competition was nothing fancy; it was built on a slope with a few pillars and surrounded by baskets and mats on three sides. If the competition was held at night, two lanterns would be hung on the edge of the stage. Although they were not as bright as electric lights, they still shone brightly, attracting countless green insects to fly around the light.

The contestants, regardless of age or status, could all participate. The singers would dress up neatly and brightly, not inferior to how they would dress for the New Year. The judges were composed of those who had previously won the championship or runner-up titles, and they would decide the rankings on the spot. The prizes were usually items like basins, towels, and straw hats. My neighbor, Sister Yu Mei, was considered the top singer in the village, having won the "three consecutive championships" and was known as the "nightingale of the tea region." I remember during the time of learning from Xiaojinzhuang, to welcome the inspection team from above, the brigade leader wanted her to sing "Ten Lessons from Xiaojinzhuang" using the tea song melody, but she refused! When she was really pushed to the limit, she would sing until her voice was hoarse, making the leader stomp his feet and beat his chest in frustration. Alas, at that time, the mountains were barren and the land was desolate, with no tea trees to be seen for ten miles. The villagers sighed at the sight of the mountains, and who could sing with such a heavy heart?

The heavens can be so capricious. Just a moment ago, it was clear and sunny, but when I reached the tea mountain, a thick fog had rolled in from somewhere, covering the tea mountain in a white haze, not allowing me to see it, as if it were intentionally playing a riddle with me... However, the fog could block my vision, but it could not block my hearing or my sense of smell—

The laughter of the tea pickers came through, muffled and distant!

The birds' songs came through, here and there!

The fragrant aroma of the tea came through, refreshing and invigorating!

The beautiful and sweet tea songs came through, floating in the air!

Oh, tea songs! I heard the tea songs of my hometown again. These tea songs that can squeeze out the freshness of spring tea and the fragrance of the soil! These tea songs that carry the joy of the tea farmers' harvest, the happiness of labor, and the green hopes in their hearts! It was as if a gentle breeze was brushing against my sweaty face, as if a mountain spring was flowing into my parched heart. My homesickness surged up, and I couldn't help but hum along, with words but without a tune. At this moment, my heart seemed to have jumped out of my chest, turning into a green tea song, running wildly on the tea mountain, impossible to call back.

"Uncle, you're back!" A young girl with a slender figure and bright eyes greeted me. Upon closer look, it was Water Bamboo, the daughter of Sister Yu Mei.

"Where are you going?" I asked.

She smiled gently: "To the singing competition, of course!"

"Singing competition? Today is not the Rainy Season, how come..."

"Tea experts from the provincial capital are coming today, so we are holding a special tea song competition to welcome them."

Water Bamboo also told me that since the good policies came to our tea mountain, the young village head proposed that we should rely on the mountains to eat and rely on tea to get rich, aiming to produce top-quality tea to enter the big cities and even export it overseas! The village has set up training classes to teach us young people the cultivation and processing of tea leaves, and even foreign languages!

I listened quietly and nodded.

Water Bamboo glanced at her watch, smiled at me (as if to say she couldn't stay with me any longer), and hurried down the mountain.

The fog had dissipated, and layer upon layer of lush tea gardens unfolded before my eyes.

Below the mountain, the sound of drums and gongs rose, and the tea songs floated up, making me quicken my steps...

### 家乡的茶歌

　　家乡的茶歌
    王静平
    好久好久没听到家乡的茶歌了。
    汽车还在蜿蜒的山区公路上盘旋，我的心早就翻山越岭飞到了家乡。
    我的家乡位于千里大别山中段，山高土肥，栖云养雾，是个有名的茶乡。记得每到采茶时节，那些红褂子绿裤子辫梢上系着红绳子的山妹子们，背着竹篓，成群结队上山采茶。远远望去，仿佛点缀于万绿丛中的一朵朵红花，又似一束束闪烁的火焰。她们边采着茶边唱着茶歌，有时你唱我和，有时一领众合，那优美的音韵，系在风的游丝上，从这坡飘到那坡，从那坡飘到这坡。
    我家乡的茶歌，歌词大都四言八句，通俗易懂，一袋烟功夫便能凑上一首，却几乎包容了所有的情绪。热烈奔放的，婉转清甜的，细腻柔情的，高亢深沉的……
    在我家乡，不单采茶时节唱茶歌，平时也歌声不断；也不单采茶姑娘会唱，那田地里盘扒的老伯，那小河旁浣洗的村妇，那牛背上打滚儿的光腚，那老槐树下扭绳打索的后生，谁都能来上一段两段！有趣的是，村里每逢嫁女娶媳，添子加孙这些喜庆事儿，当家的少不了要挑选几名歌手唱唱茶歌，凑份热闹。更有趣的是，乡亲们放落年饭碗，顶要紧的事儿是吊嗓练歌，出门唱，进门哼，曲不离口。这是因为年年谷雨节，村里都要举行茶歌赛，就像水乡五月端午赛龙舟。
    这一天，外甥接舅，女儿接娘，情郎接阿妹，阿妹接情郎，家家户户都把自己的三亲六眷请来了，加上十里八村蜂飞蝶舞般赶来看热闹的人们，简直把村子闹沸了！赛台没什么讲究，依坡儿就坎儿，略作修补，立几根柱子，用晒筐、竹席什么的围个三面，就算是台儿了。如果是在夜里比赛，就在台沿吊两只便壶灯，虽不敌电灯，却也火红一片，引得无数的绿色小虫绕着火光团团飞舞。
    参赛者不论年龄大小，辈份高低，愿者都可参加。歌手们都打扮得齐齐整整，鲜鲜亮亮，不亚于过年过节。由曾夺得过冠亚军者组成评委会，当场决出名次，奖品不外乎脸盆啦毛巾啦草帽啦什么的。我隔壁的玉梅姐算得上全村唱茶歌的第一块牌儿，曾拿过“三连冠”，被誉为茶乡“百灵鸟”。记得学习小靳庄那阵，为迎接上面的检查团，大队头头要她用茶歌的曲调演唱《十学小靳庄》，她才不去呢！实在顶不住，她就将嗓子弄哑了，气得头头顿足捶胸。唉，那时，山荒土失，十里茶园不见茶，乡亲们望山兴叹，哪个肚子里不窝着气，谁还唱得起来？！
    天真会捉弄人，刚才还晴晴朗朗，等我上得茶山，却不知从哪儿来了那么多的雾，白茫茫一片，将茶山遮瞒起来，不让我看，像故意打个谜儿让我猜……不过，雾能阻塞我的视觉，却不能阻塞我的听觉与嗅觉——
    那磕磕碰碰的笑声传出来了！
    那忽西忽东的鸟音漏出来了！
    那沁人心脾的香馨溢出来了！
    那优美甜柔的茶歌飘出来了！
    哦，茶歌！又听到家乡的茶歌了。这拧得出春茶的绿意，拧得出泥土的芳香的茶歌呵！这带着茶农收获的喜悦、劳动的欢乐和心中绿色的希冀的茶歌呵！仿佛薰薰清风拂着我汗湿的面颊，仿佛潺潺山泉流进我干渴的心窝，我的乡情顿然升起，不禁有调儿没词儿轻轻应和着。此刻，我的心儿呵，像蹦出了胸外，变成一支翠绿的茶歌，在茶山漫跑，唤也唤不回。
    “大伯，您回来啦！”
    一位身段苗条有一双水灵灵大眼睛的妹子在跟我打招呼。仔细一瞧，原来是玉梅姐的细女儿水竹。
    “去哪儿呀？”我问。
    她莞尔一笑：“赛歌去呗！”
    “赛歌？今天又不是谷雨节，怎么……”
    “大省城的茶专家今天来，我们特地举行一次茶歌赛，为专家们接接风呢”。
    水竹还告诉我，自从好政策上了咱茶山，年轻的村长就提出，靠山吃山，靠茶致富，要搞出第一流的好茶打入大城市，直至打到国外！村里办起了培训班，让我们年轻人学茶叶的栽培和制作，还学外语呢！
    我听着，默默地点头。
    水竹看了看表，向我笑了笑（那意思是不能陪我了），便匆匆下山去了。
    雾，已经褪去了，一片连着一片郁郁葱葱的茶园全部展现在我的眼前。
    山下，锣鼓声起，茶歌飘来，我不禁加快了脚步……
