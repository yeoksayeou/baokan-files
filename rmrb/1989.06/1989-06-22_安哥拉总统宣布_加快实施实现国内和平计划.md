Xinhua News Agency, Luanda, June 21st

Angolan President Jose Eduardo dos Santos today announced that the Angolan government's plan to achieve domestic peace will be accelerated, and the leader of the rebel group UNITA, Jonas Savimbi, may accept the principles of the Angolan government.

Dos Santos made the announcement during a speech to Angolan diplomatic officials at the presidential palace. Dos Santos said that the Central Committee of the People's Movement for the Liberation of Angola (MPLA), the People's Assembly, and the government have discussed and approved a plan to achieve domestic peace. The plan proposes to handle the Savimbi issue in a special way, meaning Savimbi should voluntarily leave Angola temporarily and recognize the Angolan government and constitution. The heads of eight African countries supported this plan at a meeting in Luanda on May 16. Zairean President Mobutu also promised to cooperate with the Angolan government in implementing the peace plan.

The Angolan President emphasized that Mobutu recently reported that Savimbi may accept the principles of peace. Therefore, the next meeting of African heads of state on Angolan peace, originally scheduled for August this year, will be advanced to June 22 in Zaire.

The Angolan government has already sent a delegation led by the Chief of the General Staff of the Armed Forces, Fernanda, to Zaire to prepare for the meeting.

Local sources believe that the June 22 meeting of African heads of state may achieve a key breakthrough in resolving the issue of domestic peace in Angola.

The Angolan President also pointed out that his government has formulated a plan for the reintegration of UNITA members into society, but this plan can only be implemented if UNITA completely stops its military and propaganda activities against the government. Therefore, vigilance must not be relaxed.

Since Angola's independence in 1975, the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola (UNITA), which was once an anti-Portuguese colonial guerrilla organization, has been conducting armed activities against the government with the support of the United States and South Africa, and the domestic war has lasted for 14 years. The Angolan government has consistently adopted a policy of military strikes and lenient treatment towards UNITA. On February 4 this year, the Angolan government issued an amnesty law for UNITA members. In March, the Angolan Parliament approved a seven-point plan for achieving domestic peace, including stopping South African and American interference in Angolan internal affairs, maintaining a one-party system, implementing amnesty, and handling the Savimbi issue in a special way.

    安哥拉总统宣布
    加快实施实现国内和平计划
    新华社罗安达6月21日电（记者赵晓钟）安哥拉总统多斯桑托斯今天宣布，安哥拉政府提出的实现国内和平的计划将加快实施，反政府武装安盟首领萨文比有可能接受安哥拉政府的原则。
    多斯桑托斯总统是在总统府对安哥拉外交官员讲话时作上述宣布的。多斯桑托斯说，安哥拉人运－劳动党中央、人民议会和政府讨论通过了实现国内和平的计划，其中提出以特殊方式处理萨文比问题，即萨文比应主动暂时离开安哥拉，承认安哥拉政府和宪法。非洲八国首脑5月16日在罗安达开会对这一计划给予支持。扎伊尔总统蒙博托也保证在执行和平计划方面与安政府合作。
    安哥拉总统强调，蒙博托近日通报说，萨文比有可能接受和平原则。因此，原定今年8月举行的下次关于安哥拉和平的非洲部分首脑会议将提前至6月22日在扎伊尔举行。
    安哥拉政府20日已派出以武装部队总参谋长费兰萨为首的代表团赴扎伊尔做会议准备工作。
    此间人士认为，22日的非洲部分国家首脑会议可能会在实现安哥拉国内和平问题上取得关键性突破。
    安哥拉总统同时指出，其政府已制订安盟人员重返社会的计划，但只有安盟完全停止反政府军事行动和宣传活动，这项计划才能实施，因而还不能放松警惕。
    在安哥拉1975年独立后，曾是反葡萄牙殖民主义游击组织的争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟（安盟），在美国和南非支持下长期进行反政府武装活动，国内战火持续14年。安哥拉政府对安盟一直采取军事打击和宽大处理两手政策。今年2月4日，安政府对安盟人员颁布大赦法。3月，安议会通过实现国内和平的七点计划，包括南非和美国停止干涉安内政、坚持安一党制、实行大赦，以特殊方式处理萨文比问题等。
