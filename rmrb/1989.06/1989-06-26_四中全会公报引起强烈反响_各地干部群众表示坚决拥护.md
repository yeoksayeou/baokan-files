Since the State Council imposed martial law on Lhasa, due to the insistence on ideological and political work and the education of adhering to the four cardinal principles, the situation in Lhasa has been relatively stable when disturbances occurred in some cities across the country, which shows that the party's basic line must be adhered to for a long time.
