Mexico Reaches Agreement with Paris Club Member Countries to Restructure Maturing Debt and Interest

	Mexico City, June 5 (People's Daily) — Reporter Guo Weicheng: The Mexican government reached an agreement with the Paris Club member countries on May 30 to restructure part of the maturing debt and most of the interest.

	The Mexican Ministry of Finance announced on May 30 that Mexico successfully concluded negotiations with representatives from 16 governments of the Paris Club regarding the restructuring of maturing debt principal and interest, as well as the continuation of export-import credit to Mexico. The representatives agreed to Mexico's economic plan, committing to maintaining appropriate credit levels for Mexico, including providing necessary financial assistance over the next few years to support Mexico's plans for economic recovery and export-import growth. The agreement restructures debt including $2.6 billion in principal due from June 1, 1989, to March 31, 1992; 100% of the interest due from June 1, 1989, to March 31, 1990; 90% of the interest due from April 1, 1990, to March 31, 1991; and 80% of the interest due from April 1, 1991, to May 25, 1992. This is the second time the Paris Club has reached such a large-scale debt restructuring agreement with a debtor country. Both sides also agreed to further discuss the restructuring of principal and interest due after May 25, 1992, with a term of 10 years and a grace period of 5 years.

	Representatives from the International Monetary Fund, the World Bank, and the Inter-American Development Bank participated in the negotiations. U.S. financial experts stated that not only should government financial institutions restructure debt with debtor countries, but private banks should also take action in debt restructuring.

	Mexican public opinion believes that Mexico is making significant progress in debt restructuring.

	The chairman of the Mexican Business Association said that there is reason to believe that negotiations between Mexico and international private banks on debt will make new progress.
