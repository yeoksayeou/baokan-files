Last October, reporters from the *War Friend* newspaper conducted a survey of 100 soldiers in a certain tank regiment of the Beijing Military Region. In the section asking "Who do you admire most around you?", every respondent wrote the same name: "Qiao Wenqing"!

Recently, the Beijing Military Region honored Qiao Wenqing with the title of "Leifeng-Style Soldier."

"Even if you can't do your main job well, how can you talk about doing other things?"

In November 1984, Qiao Wenqing, who was feeling disheartened, was inspired by a letter from his third brother, who was serving as a volunteer soldier, announcing his commendation for meritorious service. He decided to join the military camp. He was determined to become a motorized soldier like his brother. After three months, he achieved two first places and one second place in the military and political assessments of all new recruits in the regiment, earning him a commendation. Just at this time, the company notified him to go to the tank training base to learn how to drive a tank. The winter in the tank was like an ice cave, and the summer was like a furnace, which made his heart sink. He regretted joining the army, otherwise, he would have become a "millionaire" by now. It was only after the political instructor's persuasion that he felt a glimmer of hope in his heart.

Qiao Wenqing, who had only attended school for six years, found it difficult to understand some of the complex theories after arriving at the tank base. He scolded himself, "Even if you can't do your main job well, how can you talk about doing other things?" He spent every day from dawn to dusk, squeezing in time to repeatedly memorize theories and practice operations. In eight months, Qiao Wenqing only returned home once, after being reminded by the leader at the end of the training, to a place just 5 kilometers away from the base.

Upon returning home, he had barely sat down when his second brother started crying. It turned out that since this capable "kiln master" had joined the army, his second brother had been struggling to manage two kilns alone, working hard for a year but not earning a single penny, and even incurring a loss of over 1,000 yuan. Just a few days ago, he had sold the two kilns to someone else. Qiao Wenqing's former girlfriend, seeing that he had joined the army and impoverished his family, also did not want to associate with him anymore. Neighbors and friends advised, "Don't be foolish, just come back!"

Qiao Wenqing gritted his teeth and continued. Among the soldiers who enlisted in the same year, he was the first to become a first-class tank driver.

According to regulations, training car drivers do not need to be present during training, but they do need to be in the car. However, he always accompanied the drivers, observing closely. On April 14, 1986, after a full day of driving, Qiao Wenqing was already exhausted with a sore back and legs. When the last untrained driver was driving, he suddenly noticed that the oil pressure gauge was abnormal and ordered the car to stop immediately. After inspection, it was found that the oil pipe had aged and ruptured. The tank technician said that if it had been discovered one minute later, it would have caused a serious accident of burning the engine. Similar major malfunctions were discovered by him three times, preventing economic losses of over 38,000 yuan.

He had wanted to go to the front lines to be a hero, but instead, he was doing unnoticed small things; he believed that as long as he could bring convenience to others, he would feel content.

He had repeatedly applied to the leadership to go to the front lines but was not approved, so he turned his enthusiasm to the small things in life. For years, he would get up early every day to clean the surroundings of the company, wash clothes, brush shoes, and fetch water for his fellow soldiers. He also often went to the kitchen to help with the cooking. The toilets, pigpens, doors, windows, vegetable cellars, and even the flowers and trees in the camp area all bore the marks of his labor. He often used holidays to push a small cart, carrying a shovel, to various corners of the camp area, such as the office building, auditorium, guest house, and family quarters, to clean the surroundings. Because the wheels of the small cart had no rubber, it made a creaking sound when pushed. Year after year, whether it was adults or children, as soon as they heard the sound, they knew Qiao Wenqing had come.

On January 7, 1986, the north wind was biting. Qiao Wenqing saw that the washing area in the company was flooded with dirty water, so he took a few soldiers to clean it up. The sewer was filled with foul-smelling sewage and sticky mud. He took off his cotton clothes and jumped in, using his hands to dig out the silt. When others wanted to replace him, he refused, saying, "It's enough for one person to get dirty." When the silt in the deep part of the pipe could not be dug out, he crawled into the pipe with a diameter of only about 40 centimeters, digging it out bit by bit, and worked for over 40 minutes until he collapsed inside.

Just as he had sent a whole kiln of bricks to a neighbor in need before joining the army without considering his own urgent need for bricks to build a house, for the sake of others' happiness, he did not calculate the value of his own labor, carelessly, as some villagers behind his back pointed out: "The Qiao family has another disabled person—a madman." After joining the army, however, he was good at living frugally. Previously, during the seasonal maintenance of tanks, over 100 kilograms of wiping cloths were consumed each year, and they were discarded after use. Starting from last year, Qiao Wenqing and his Leifeng Study Group took the initiative to pick up the dirty cloths, first soak them in waste diesel, and then repeatedly rinse them with lye for continued use.

"You are like a stone, but he will warm you up."

Qiao Wenqing still regrets one thing to this day. He had a fellow villager who enlisted at the same time. Although his family was poor, he liked to show off his wealth. Not long after enlisting, he borrowed a lot of money. Later, in order to get money, he stole on the street and was expelled from the army and sent back home. Qiao Wenqing repeatedly emptied his pockets to repay his fellow villager's debts and often advised him to be frugal. From this fellow villager's downfall, the importance of ideological mutual assistance gradually increased in Qiao Wenqing's mind.

Soldier Ren Hongyou, whom everyone called "untouchable," turned his head away when Qiao Wenqing first talked to him, saying, "Qiao Wenqing, I respect you in other aspects, but if you want to do ideological work on me, forget it." Qiao Wenqing did not give up and continued to "grind" with him.

Later, Ren Hongyou patted his chest and said, "From now on, I will definitely change." But within less than 10 days of saying this, Ren Hongyou started fighting with the cook again. This time, someone bluntly told Qiao Wenqing, "Ren Hongyou was born with a wild temper and even dares to talk back to officers. With your two tricks, you think you can control him? That's too naive." Qiao Wenqing said, "It's not easy to do his ideological work, but we can't just watch him slide downhill!" Qiao Wenqing advised the surrounding comrades not to discriminate against him but to actively approach him. With the close cooperation of the comrades, Ren Hongyou made significant progress and participated in the company's organized Leifeng Study activities. The soldiers jokingly said, "Staying with Qiao Wenqing, it's not easy to fall behind. Even if you are a stone, he will warm you up." In the past two years, Qiao Wenqing has helped 32 soldiers shed their ideological burdens, and most of them have made significant progress, with 7 of them being evaluated as various types of models. Living and working together, the comrades all regarded him as a bosom friend, and some things that were not good to tell the officers, they were willing to confide in him.

"Lead everyone to do it together, and even a 'small person' can create a 'big atmosphere.'"

In March 1987, Qiao Wenqing and his comrades Bai Guangwei and Wang Li established a Leifeng Study Group. He said, "Lead everyone to do it together, and even a 'small person' can create a 'big atmosphere.'" The three of them often did good deeds in and around the camp, attracting the surrounding comrades. Those who had some skills before enlisting in the camp, such as "small bosses," "seamstresses," "carpenters," and "watch repairmen," also actively came to join their ranks.

The activities of Qiao Wenqing's Leifeng Study Group expanded from the military camp to the granary, streets, and stations in the stationed area.

The Jin Gou Township granary stores five to six million kilograms of grain. Starting from 1986, Qiao Wenqing often took the initiative to go there to do chores, helping to transfer, dry, or clean the granary. In the summer, transferring grain in the granary was hot, stuffy, and choking, and in a short while, people would become "face people" and "mud people." The granary hired temporary workers every day for about ten yuan, but it was difficult to find people. The granary manager saw Qiao Wenqing working hard without even drinking a drop of water and thought he was there to earn money, so he drew a "correct" mark on the wall to keep accounts. After a few months, Old Zhang urged Qiao Wenqing to collect his wages, but Qiao Wenqing refused to take any. Over the years, Qiao Wenqing has volunteered to work at the Jin Gou Township granary over 130 times.

Under Qiao Wenqing's influence, the tank regiment established 25 Leifeng Study Groups. The regiment party committee broke the precedent for two consecutive years to give this non-established collective Leifeng Study Group a collective third-class merit citation. Qiao Wenqing himself was also commended twice for third-class merit, received seven commendations, was named "Leifeng Study Model" and "Excellent Volunteer Soldier" by the division and regiment five times, and was evaluated as an "Excellent Communist Party Member" by the corps.

　　“雷锋式战士”乔文清
    罗盘　秦淑文
    去年１０月，《战友报》记者在北京军区某坦克团１００名战士中做了一次战士心态问卷调查。在“你身边最佩服的人是谁？”这一栏里，被调查者竟无一例外地填写了同一个名字：“乔文清”！
    最近，北京军区授予乔文清“雷锋式战士”的光荣称号。
    “连本职工作都干不好，还谈干这弄那？”
    １９８４年１１月，苦闷的乔文清被当志愿兵的三哥的一张立功喜报激活了心，来到了军营。他决心像三哥那样，当个汽车兵。他干了３个月，在全团新兵军政考核时，取得两个第一、一个第二的优异成绩，受到了嘉奖。正在这时，连里却通知他到坦克训练基地学开坦克。冬天像冰窖，夏天似锅炉的坦克，使他的心凉了半截。他后悔当了兵，不然早成了“万元户”。指导员的劝导，才使他心里燃起一丝亮光。
    只上过６年学的乔文清，到坦克基地后，对一些复杂理论弄不明白，他暗暗责骂自己：“连本职工作都干不好，还谈干这弄那？”他每天起早贪黑挤时间，反复背理论，练操作。８个月时间里，乔文清只是在训练结束时经领导主动提示后才回了一次距基地仅５公里路的家。
    到家后他没坐稳，二哥就哭了起来。原来，打他这位能干的“烧窑师傅”当兵后，二哥一人难掌二窑，辛苦一年，不但分文不挣，还亏了１０００多元。前几天，刚把两座窑卖给了别人。乔文清原来的对象，见他当了兵，穷了家，也不愿再同他来往。亲邻好友劝道：“别傻气了，干脆回来吧！”
    乔文清咬紧牙关干下去。在同一年参军的兵中，他第一批成为坦克一级驾驶员。
    按规定，教练车驾驶员在训练期间必须到场，但不需随车。可他不论哪个驾驶员开车都一直随车观察。１９８６年４月中旬的一天，乔文清跟了一天的车，已经累得腰酸腿疼。当最后一名未经训练的驾驶员开车时，他突然发现油压表指示异常，便让立即停了车。经检查，发现油管老化破裂。坦克技师说，如晚一分钟发现，就要造成烧坏发动机的严重事故。类似这样较大的故障，他先后发现３次，避免经济损失３８０００余元。
    他本想上前线当英雄，却干起了不起眼的小事；认为能给别人带来方便，才觉得快慰。
    他曾多次找领导报名要求上前线都未获准，便转而将一腔热忱点点滴滴洒在了生活中的小事上。他数年如一日，每日提前起床为连队打扫环境，替战友洗衣、刷鞋、打洗脸水，还经常到炊事班帮厨。连队的厕所、猪圈、门窗、菜窖乃至营区的花草树木，处处留下了他劳动的痕迹。他常利用节假日推上小车，带着铁锹，到机关办公楼、礼堂、招待所、家属院等营区的各个角落打扫卫生。由于小车轱辘没有胶皮，推起来咯吱咯吱响，经年累月，不论大人还是小孩，一听到响声就知道乔文清来了。
    １９８６年１月７日，朔风凛冽。乔文清看到连队洗漱室脏水溢了一地，便带几个战士去清理。污水井内臭气呛人，污泥黏稠。他抢先脱掉棉衣棉裤，跳下去用手抠淤泥。别人要替换他，他不肯，说脏一个人就行了。管道深处的淤泥抠不到，他就钻进直径只有４０多厘米的管道内，一点点往外抠，一气干了４０多分钟，直到晕倒在里边。
    正如他入伍前曾将整窑砖瓦送给急用的乡邻而不顾自己盖房子急用砖一样，为了他人的快慰，他不计自己劳动的价值，马虎得犹如一些势利村人背后指戳的那样：“乔家又多了一个残疾人——疯子。”他到部队后，却精于过紧日子。以前，进行坦克换季保养时，每年得消耗１００多公斤擦车布，用脏了就扔。从前年开始，乔文清和他的学雷锋小组，主动把脏布捡回来，先用废柴油浸泡，再用碱水反复漂洗，继续使用。
    “你就是一块石头，他也会把你捂热。”
    乔文清为这么一件事抱憾至今。他有一位同时入伍的老乡，虽然家境贫寒，却喜欢和别人比阔。入伍时间不长，就借了一屁股债。后来，为了弄钱，上街行窃，被部队除名，遣送回家。乔文清多次替这位老乡倾囊还债，也屡劝节俭。由这位老乡的失足，思想互助的分量渐渐在乔文清心目中加重。
    战士任洪友，大伙称为“惹不起”。当乔文清第一次找他谈话时，他头一扭，撇下一句：“乔文清，你其他方面我服，但你想做我的思想工作，没门。”乔文清未灰心，仍然一次次和他“磨”。
    后来，小任拍着胸脯说：“从今往后我一定改。”但就在这句话说过不到１０天，小任又和炊事员打起架来。这一来，有人直截了当地对乔文清说：“任洪友生来野性子，和干部也敢顶嘴，就凭你那两下子，想治住他，太天真。”乔文清说：“做通他的思想工作是不太容易，但不能看着他往下滑呀！”乔文清劝周围的同志不要歧视他，要主动亲近他。在战友们的密切配合下，任洪友有了明显进步，参加了连队组织的学雷锋活动。战士们风趣地说：“和乔文清呆在一起，要想落后可不那么容易。你就是一块石头，他也会把你捂热。”近两年来，乔文清先后帮助３２名战友甩脱了思想上的包袱，其中大多数人有了明显进步，有７人还被评为各类标兵。朝夕相处，手足相抵，战友们都把他当知己，有些事不好给干部讲，却愿意找他掏心窝子。
    “带动大伙一块干，‘小人物’也能造成‘大气候’。”
    １９８７年３月，乔文清和战友白广威、王利成立了学雷锋小组。他说：“带动大伙一块干，‘小人物’也能造成‘大气候’。”他们３人经常到营区内外做好事，吸引了周围的战友。本营入伍前有一技之长的“小老板”、“缝纫师傅”、“木匠”、“修表师傅”等，也主动找上门，加入了他们的行列。
    乔文清学雷锋小组活动的范围由军营扩展到了驻地粮站，街道和车站等处。
    驻地金沟屯粮站存放五六百万公斤粮食。从１９８６年开始，乔文清经常主动上门找活干，帮助倒库、晒粮或搞卫生。夏天在库里倒粮食，又热又闷又呛，不一会儿，人就成了“面人”、“泥人”。粮站每天出十几块钱雇临时工，也难以找到人。粮站保管看到乔文清连水也不喝一口没命地干，以为他是来挣钱的，就在墙上画“正”字记帐。几个月下来，老张催乔文清领工钱，乔文清说啥也不要。几年来，乔文清为金沟屯粮站义务劳动１３０多次。
    在乔文清影响下，坦克团共成立２５个学雷锋小组。团党委连续两年破例给这个非建制集体的学雷锋小组记了集体三等功。乔文清本人也先后荣立２次三等功，７次受嘉奖，５次被师团树为“学雷锋标兵”和“优秀义务兵”，并被集团军评为“优秀共产党员”。
