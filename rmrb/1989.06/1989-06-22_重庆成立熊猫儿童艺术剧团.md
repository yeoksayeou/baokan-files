The "Chongqing Panda Children's Art Troupe" was established in March this year and recently held its official debut performance.

The historic city of Chongqing, due to various reasons in the past, had a rather monotonous after-school life for its youngsters. Cultural and educational professionals in the city, aiming to provide a healthy and enjoyable cultural life for the broad masses of youngsters, established the "Chongqing Panda Children's Art Troupe" with the support of relevant departments. During the opening ceremony, they performed "The Little Match Girl" and other plays, which were warmly received.
