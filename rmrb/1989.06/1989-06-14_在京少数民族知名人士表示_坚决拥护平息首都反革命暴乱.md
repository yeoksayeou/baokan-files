In Beijing, ethnic minority figures express resolute support for the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in the capital

	In Beijing, 136 representatives from 34 ethnic groups held a symposium at the State Ethnic Affairs Commission (SEAC) this morning to study Deng Xiaoping's important speech during his reception of senior military officers from the martial law troops. They expressed their support for the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) and the State Council's wise decision and resolute measures to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary riots.

	SEAC Director Sima Yi Aimaidi said in his speech that the CPC Central Committee and the State Council's "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" and Deng Xiaoping's important speech have deeply pointed out the causes and nature of the counter-revolutionary riots in the capital, indicated the direction for the country's reform and construction, and have great and far-reaching significance for uniting the thoughts of the whole Party and the people of the whole country, and for striving for the complete victory of suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots. He said that today's symposium fully expressed the common voice of the 55 ethnic minorities in China.

	Sima Yi Aimaidi said, suppressing the riots, stopping the turmoil, and stabilizing the situation is the top priority at present, which concerns the fate of the Party and the country and is in the fundamental interests of all ethnic groups. We in the ethnic work departments and the cadres, masses, and patriots in ethnic minority areas must resolutely safeguard this overall situation. To this end, we propose the following hopes and demands:

	First, we must continue to seriously study and resolutely implement the CPC Central Committee and the State Council's "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country," and continue to study Deng Xiaoping's important speech during his reception of senior military officers from the martial law troops. Comrade Xiaoping's speech has profoundly pointed out the causes and nature of this counter-revolutionary riot, explained the necessity of adhering to the line of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, and indicated the direction for the country's reform and construction, which is of great significance. We must use Comrade Xiaoping's speech to unify our thoughts, unify our understanding, distinguish right from wrong, and firmly establish our stance. We must maintain a high degree of consistency with the Party Central Committee in our thoughts, politics, organization, and actions. This is our central task in the near future.

	Second, we must continue to actively engage in the struggle to suppress the riots and stop the turmoil. We must resolutely expose those few who have long been stubbornly adhering to the bourgeois liberalization stance, engaging in political conspiracies, colluding with hostile forces abroad, providing state and party core secrets to illegal organizations, and a small number of rioters who engage in beating, smashing, looting, and burning. We must condemn their crimes and resolutely fight to defend the leadership of the Communist Party of China, defend the People's Republic, defend the socialist system, and defend the constitution.

	Third, we must continue to raise high the banner of great unity among ethnic groups and contribute to stabilizing the situation and maintaining stability and unity. In the face of the riots in the capital and turmoil in some cities, ethnic minority areas have maintained stability and made valuable contributions to maintaining the overall situation. We must continue to do a good job in strengthening the great unity among ethnic groups, properly solve new problems that have arisen in ethnic relations, earnestly do a good job in poverty alleviation and disaster relief, help the masses solve problems in production and life, and strive to eliminate all factors of instability. We must enhance the cohesion and centripetal force of all ethnic groups and develop equal, united, and mutually supportive socialist ethnic relations. We must resolutely expose and strike against the activities of domestic and foreign hostile forces that disrupt ethnic unity and split national unity. All cadres and staff of the SEAC system and all ethnic minority comrades working and studying in Beijing must actively support and cooperate with the martial law troops, the armed police, and the public security police to stabilize the situation in the capital and restore normal work, teaching, production, and living order.

	Fourth, we must grasp both stability and reform and construction. The ethnic work departments and cadres and masses of all ethnic groups in ethnic minority areas must firmly hold their posts, be loyal to their duties, and work hard to complete this year's work and production tasks. We must work together to continue to push forward the reform and opening up and various construction undertakings.

	SEAC Deputy Directors Wu Jinghua and Jiang Jiafu also spoke at the symposium. They resolutely supported the central decision. They said that the people of the 55 ethnic minorities deeply understand that without the leadership of the Communist Party and the guarantee of the socialist system, there would be no equal status for ethnic minorities to be masters of their own affairs, and there would be no bright future for ethnic minorities to prosper and develop. Instead, they would fall back into the abyss of ethnic oppression, ethnic exploitation, and ethnic discrimination. Therefore, resolutely supporting the leadership of the Communist Party, supporting the socialist system, adhering to reform and opening up, and maintaining national unity and ethnic unity are the common choices made by the people of all ethnic groups in the long course of historical development. This choice is unshakable and unchangeable by any reactionary forces, whether in the past, present, or future.

	Speakers at the symposium also included Pu Jie (Manchu), Tian Fuda (Gaoshan), An Shiwei (Hui), Bai Kui (Hui), Fu Shengsong (Miao), He Run (Bai), Na Cang (Tibetan), Chun Shize (Mongol), and Hamiti (Uyghur). In their speeches, they all angrily condemned the crimes committed by a few people in creating the counter-revolutionary riots in the capital; unanimously supported the CPC Central Committee and the State Council's "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country," supported Deng Xiaoping's important speech during his reception of senior military officers from the martial law troops, and supported the Party and the government's series of wise decisions and resolute measures to stop the turmoil and suppress the riots; and expressed their deep respect and gratitude for the great revolutionary spirit shown by the People's Liberation Army martial law troops, the armed police, and the public security police in suppressing the riots.

　　在京少数民族知名人士表示
    坚决拥护平息首都反革命暴乱
    新华社北京６月１４日电  国家民委今天上午举行座谈会，在京的３４个民族成份的１３６名少数民族知名人士代表在会上认真学习邓小平同志在接见戒严部队军以上干部时的重要讲话，拥护党中央、国务院为制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱所采取的英明决策和果断措施。
    国家民委主任司马义·艾买提在讲话中说，中共中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》和邓小平同志的重要讲话，深刻地指明了首都这场反革命暴乱发生的原因和实质，指明了今后国家改革与建设的前进方向，对统一全党、全国人民的思想，团结奋斗，争取平息反革命暴乱的彻底胜利，具有重大和深远的意义，表示坚决贯彻执行。他说，今天的座谈会上大家的发言，完全表达了我国５５个少数民族人民的共同心声。
    司马义·艾买提说，平息暴乱、制止动乱、稳定局势是当前压倒一切的任务，是关系党和国家命运的大事，也是各族人民的根本利益所在。我们民族工作部门和少数民族地区的干部、群众、爱国人士，要坚决地服从和维护这一大局。为此我们提出以下几点希望和要求：
    第一，要继续认真地学习和坚决贯彻中共中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》，继续学习邓小平同志在接见戒严部队军以上干部时的重要讲话。小平同志的讲话，精辟地深刻地指明了这场反革命暴乱产生的原因和性质，阐明了坚持党的十一届三中全会路线的必要性，对今后我国的改革与建设指明了前进的方向，意义非常重大。要用小平同志的讲话统一思想，统一认识，明辨是非，坚定立场，在思想上、政治上、组织上、行动上同党中央保持高度的一致。这是我们在最近一段时间的中心任务。
    第二，要继续积极地进行平息暴乱、制止动乱的斗争。我们要坚决地揭露那些极少数长期顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场、搞政治阴谋的人，同海外敌对势力相勾结的人，向非法组织提供党和国家核心机密的人，以及一小撮搞打、砸、抢、烧的暴徒，声讨他们的罪行，旗帜鲜明地为捍卫中国共产党的领导、捍卫人民共和国、捍卫社会主义制度、捍卫宪法进行不懈的斗争。
    第三，要更高地举起民族大团结的旗帜，继续为稳定局势，维护安定团结贡献力量。各个少数民族地区在首都发生暴乱、一些城市发生动乱的情况下，保持了局势的稳定，为维护大局作出了宝贵的贡献，要再接再厉进一步做好加强民族大团结的工作，妥善解决民族关系方面出现的新问题，认真做好扶贫、救灾工作，帮助群众解决生产生活中的困难，努力消除一切不安定的因素增强各族人民的向心力和凝聚力，发展平等、团结、互助的社会主义民族关系。对国内外敌对势力破坏民族团结和分裂祖国统一的活动，要给予坚决地揭露和打击。国家民委系统的全体干部职工和在京工作、学习的所有少数民族同志，都要积极支持、配合戒严部队、武警部队和公安干警，为稳定首都的局势，恢复正常的工作、教学、生产、生活秩序作出努力。
    第四，要一手抓稳定局势，一手抓改革建设。民族工作部门和少数民族地区的各族干部、群众，都要坚守岗位，忠于职守，扎扎实实地做好工作、搞好生产，圆满地完成今年的工作和生产任务，同心同德地把改革开放和各项建设事业继续推向前进。
    国家民委副主任伍精华、江家福也在座谈会上讲了话，他们坚决拥护中央的决策。他们说，我们５５个少数民族的人民都深深懂得，没有共产党的领导，没有社会主义制度的保障，就没有少数民族当家作主的平等地位，就没有少数民族兴旺繁荣的美好前途，就会重新陷入民族压迫、民族剥削、民族歧视的苦难深渊。所以，坚决拥护共产党的领导，拥护社会主义制度，坚持改革开放，维护国家统一和民族团结，是各族人民在长期历史的发展中作出的共同抉择。这一抉择，不论在过去、现在还是将来都是任何反动力量所动摇不了和改变不了的。
    座谈会上发言的还有溥杰（满族）、田富达（高山族）、安士伟（回族）、白奎（回族）、符盛松（苗族）、何润（白族）、拿仓（藏族）、春世增（蒙古族）、哈米提（维吾尔族）。他们在发言中，都愤怒地声讨了极少数人在首都制造反革命暴乱的种种罪行；一致拥护党中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》，拥护邓小平同志在接见戒严部队军以上干部时的重要讲话，拥护党和政府为制止动乱、平息暴乱所采取的一系列英明决策和果断措施；对人民解放军戒严部队、武警部队、公安干警在平息暴乱中表现的大无畏革命精神，表示了无比崇敬和感谢之情。
