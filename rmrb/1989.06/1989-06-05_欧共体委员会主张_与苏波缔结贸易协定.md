The European Commission has proposed to the Council that "ambitious trade agreements" be concluded with the Soviet Union and Poland. The foreign ministers of the 12 member states immediately welcomed this, reflecting Western Europe's strong desire to strengthen economic cooperation with Eastern Europe and indicating that East-West European relations are poised for significant substantive progress.

Vice-President of the European Commission, Mr. Andriessen, asked the Council to authorize the Commission to begin negotiations with Moscow. In his proposal, he pointed out that the negotiations would lead to a 10-year trade and economic cooperation agreement. In terms of trade, the agreement would cover most-favored-nation treatment, the gradual elimination by the European Community of quantitative restrictions on Soviet exports, and how to facilitate bilateral trade exchanges. In terms of economic cooperation, the agreement would make provisions for cooperation in statistics, standardization, and especially in environmental protection and technology. In this sense, the agreement is similar to the bilateral agreements signed by the European Community with Hungary or Czechoslovakia. However, Andriessen, on behalf of the Commission, first proposed to the Council that the European Atomic Energy Community and the Soviet Union should cooperate in the field of civilian nuclear energy research, which is particularly noteworthy.

The European Council may decide to accept the Commission's proposal at its next meeting on June 12.

Negotiations between the European Community and Poland on trade began formally in February this year. To "encourage this country's economic and political reforms," the Commission proposed reaching "the broadest possible agreement." To this end, it put forward three specific suggestions: 1) to eliminate all quota restrictions in trade by 1995; 2) for the European Community to make some concessions to facilitate the export of Polish agricultural products; 3) to prepare for the European Investment Bank to take some measures to reduce Poland's debt.

According to local news sources, officials from the European Community believe that the trade agreement with Poland may be finalized before the end of this summer.

At the meeting of the European Council of Foreign Ministers on May 21, Andriessen also reported on the latest developments in trade relations with the United States. Over the weekend, both sides agreed to submit two disputes over sugar and soybeans to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for arbitration. In the case of sugar products, the European Community complained that the United States had been violating the provisions of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade for 33 years by protecting its own market and developing its domestic products. In the case of soybean exports, the United States accused the European Community of subsidizing its producers. Some member state representatives attending the Council, particularly the foreign ministers of Britain and West Germany, believed that the European Community should adopt a "firm and cautious" stance in dealing with relations with the United States.

　　欧共体委员会主张
    与苏波缔结贸易协定
    本报布鲁塞尔电  记者魏崴报道：５月２２日，欧洲共同体委员会向理事会建议与苏联和波兰缔结“雄心勃勃的贸易协定”，１２个成员国的外长们当即对此表示欢迎，反映出西欧意欲加强和东欧经济合作的强烈愿望，预示着东西欧关系将取得重大的实质性进展。
    欧共体委员会副主席安德里森，要求理事会授权委员会同莫斯科举行谈判。他在建议中指出，谈判将导致达成为期１０年的贸易和经济合作协定。在贸易方面，协定将涉及最惠国待遇，欧共体逐步取消对苏联出口货物的数量限制，以及如何便利双边贸易往来等问题。在经济合作方面，协定将就统计、标准化，特别在环保、科技等领域内的合作作出规定。就这个意义上讲，该协定和欧共体与匈牙利或捷克斯洛伐克签署的双边协定，大致相仿。但是，安德里森代表委员会首次向理事会建议，欧洲原子能共同体与苏联之间，在民用核能研究方面开展合作，则特别引人瞩目。
    欧共体理事会可能在６月１２日召开的下一届会议上，作出同意委员会建议的决定。
    欧共体与波兰之间的贸易谈判，已于今年２月间正式开始，为“鼓励这个国家的经济、政治改革”，委员会建议与之达成“一次尽可能广泛的协议”。为此，它提三条具体意见：１、到１９９５年，取消贸易中的一切配额限制；２、欧共体作出若干让步，以便利波兰农产品的出口；３、准备让欧洲投资银行采取一些措施，以减轻波兰的债务。
    据此间新闻界透露，欧共体有关人士认为，与波兰的贸易协定，可能在今年夏天之前出台。
    在５月２１日举行的欧共体外长理事会上，安德里森还介绍了与美国的外贸关系近况。上周末，欧美双方同意将糖和大豆的两项争端提交关贸总协定审理。在糖类产品方面，欧共体抱怨美国违背关贸总协定的规定，３３年以来一直采取保护自己市场、发展本国产品的做法。而在大豆出口方面，美国指责欧共体补贴它的生产者。出席理事会的一些成员国代表，特别是英国和西德外长，认为欧共体在处理与美国的关系上，应采取“坚定和谨慎”的立场。
