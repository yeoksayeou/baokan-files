The leadership of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions (ACFTU) today carefully studied the documents from the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. They unanimously agreed that the session, convened at a critical moment when the Party and the country faced life-and-death struggles, was a historic meeting of great significance. The ACFTU resolutely supports all the important decisions made at the session, the correct policies and major measures taken by the Party Central Committee to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary riot, the decision regarding Zhao Ziyang's serious errors in supporting the turmoil and splitting the Party, the adjustments made to the Party's central leadership, and the appointment of Jiang Zemin as the General Secretary of the Party Central Committee.

The leadership expressed their full support for the session's bulletin's high evaluation of the role played by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at their core, in this struggle. They believe that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech during his meeting with senior military officers of the Beijing martial law troops is a guiding document for unifying our thoughts. The ACFTU calls on all trade union cadres and workers across the country to continue studying this guiding document, to deepen their understanding, unify their thoughts, and unswervingly follow the line, principles, and policies set forth since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and the basic line of "one center, two basic points" established at the Thirteenth Party Congress. They must strive to defend the four cardinal principles and continue to walk the path of reform and opening up to strengthen the country. This is the glorious historical mission of the Chinese working class and the fundamental guarantee for revitalizing China and achieving the Four Modernizations.

The meeting believes that the session's bulletin's proposal to focus on four major tasks fully reflects the wishes and demands of workers across the country to thoroughly stop the turmoil, suppress the counter-revolutionary riot, stabilize the situation, continue to improve governance, promote economic development, advance democratic and legal construction, and resolutely punish corruption. It embodies the fundamental interests of workers across the country. All levels of trade unions must play an active role in focusing on these four major tasks, boost morale, work hard, better serve the overall situation, and better serve the workers. Workers across the country must further play the vanguard role of the working class, make greater contributions to stabilizing the situation, developing the economy, and making up for the losses caused by the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot. They must achieve outstanding results to welcome the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and the convening of the National Labor Models and Advanced Workers Conference!
