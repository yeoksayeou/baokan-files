The communiqué of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee, released on June 24, has sparked strong reactions among cadres and the masses nationwide. Those who participated in study sessions and discussions have expressed their firm support for the decisions made by the plenum.

Beijing

On the evening of June 24, cadres and the masses in offices, factories, shops, and schools listened to and watched the communiqué of the Fourth Plenum on the radio and television. Today, they eagerly read the newspapers.

The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held an expanded meeting of its Standing Committee this afternoon to study and discuss the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee. The meeting expressed full support for all the decisions made by the Fourth Plenum. The meeting believed that the Fourth Plenum was convened at a crucial moment when the counter-revolutionary rebellion had been decisively suppressed. The plenum will play a significant role in unifying the thoughts of the entire Party and the people, stabilizing the national situation; in consolidating the Party's leadership, maintaining the unity of the Party and the people; and in seriously summarizing historical experiences, better implementing the line, principles, and policies of the Thirteenth Central Committee since the Third Plenum, adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, and persisting with reform and opening up.

During the discussions among cadres and the masses, everyone enthusiastically shared their thoughts. Deputy Secretary and Mayor of Dongcheng District, Beijing, Xu Haifeng, and Deputy Secretary of the District Committee, Jin Shengguan, believed that the resolutions made by the Fourth Plenum fully align with the wishes of the entire Party, the military, and the people, and fully demonstrate the strength and hope of our Party. Vice President of Beijing Normal University, Xu Jialu, said that Zhao Ziyang supported the turmoil and split the Party. Beijing evolved from turmoil to rebellion, and he bears an inescapable responsibility. Xu Jialu said that the Central Committee's plenum proposed several important tasks. Currently, it is especially important to distinguish between two types of contradictions, which is also a major concern for overseas individuals. The Central Committee's plenum emphasizes this point, which is very important. Steelworker Zhang Liyang from the Capital Iron and Steel Corporation said that the communiqué reflects the aspirations of the working class, making the broad masses of workers feel more secure.

Shanghai

From last night to today, people from various sectors in Shanghai held discussions, expressing their support for the decisions made by the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee, and resolved to unite around the Party Central Committee, redoubling their efforts to accomplish the four major tasks proposed in the communiqué.

Party, government, and military leaders participating in the expanded meeting of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China shared their thoughts. Mayor Ye Gongqi said that the Fourth Plenum has solved the problem organizationally and proposed four major tasks. We are determined to work hard under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, relying on the support of the broad masses of the people. Vice Chairman of the Municipal Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Zhao Xingzhi, said that the Fourth Plenum is a great victory, but the struggle is far from over, both domestically and internationally. We must unite with the Communist Party of China as the core, work together, and complete the Four Modernizations to benefit the people. Everyone believed that the Central Committee's selection of a new leadership team is a reliable organizational guarantee for fully implementing the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee.

Retired former Vice Secretary of the Shanghai Municipal Committee, Chen Yi, happily told the reporter that as an old Party member, he had long been looking forward to this day. The Fourth Plenum has ensured the basic line of "one center, two basic points" proposed by the Thirteenth Party Congress in terms of politics, ideology, and organization.

Tianjin

On the evening of June 24, thousands of households in Tianjin listened to and watched the communiqué of the Fourth Plenum on television and radio.

The Tianjin Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held a meeting of its Standing Committee on the morning of June 25 to study and discuss the communiqué of the Fourth Plenum. The Standing Committee members expressed their firm support for the communiqué of the Fourth Plenum and the adjustments made to the central leadership. Everyone believed that the new members elected to the central leadership, such as Jiang Zemin, Song Ping, and Li Ruihuan, have all been tested through long-term revolutionary struggles and have rich leadership experience in political and economic work. They have made outstanding achievements and contributions in both central and local work and enjoy high prestige both within and outside the Party, especially during this turmoil, their stance has been firm and their banner clear. Electing these comrades to the central leadership is the will of the people.

Everyone supported the removal of Zhao Ziyang's Party positions, believing that the nature of Zhao Ziyang's errors and the extremely serious consequences pointed out by the plenum are objective, fair, and completely correct. Although it is a Sunday, many units' cadres and the masses still organized the study and discussion of the communiqué with great interest. General Manager of Tianjin Renli Wool Textile Mill, Tong Daming, said that this meeting is clear-cut on major principles and issues, decisive in attitude, in line with the Party's will, and in line with the people's will. The Central Committee, after personnel adjustments, will be more united and powerful. The Party members in our enterprise are full of confidence.

Changsha

After listening to and watching the communiqué of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee, some factories, schools, and members of democratic parties in Hunan Province immediately held discussions, expressing their firm support for the decisions made by the Fourth Plenum.

The leaders of the National University of Defense Technology held a discussion last night, believing that the Central Committee convened this important meeting at a time when the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion had been initially suppressed, which is completely necessary and timely. It not only has significant real significance but also has far-reaching historical significance.

Hunan Province Shuguang Electronic Tube Factory, which has maintained production and achieved good economic results during the turmoil, organized its cadres and workers to study the communiqué seriously. Old worker Shao Yutian said that the Central Committee quickly convened the Fourth Plenum and removed Zhao Ziyang's leadership positions, which we do not find sudden. Zhao Ziyang, as the General Secretary of the Party, supported the turmoil and split the Party in a critical moment, and his errors are very serious. Removing his leadership positions is completely justified.

Vice Chairman of the Hunan Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Xu Junhu, believed that the Central Committee convened the Fourth Plenum in a timely manner to handle Zhao Ziyang's serious errors, which is decisive and timely. He believed that we should seriously summarize the experience and lessons, and spiritual civilization construction and ideological and political work should no longer stop at paper and words.

Xi'an

People from various sectors in Shaanxi Province and Xi'an City generally believe that after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, the Central Committee convened the Fourth Plenum in a timely manner, which played an important role in quickly stabilizing the national situation.

Secretary of the Shaanxi Provincial Committee and Xi'an Municipal Committee, An Qiyuan, expressed his full support for the important personnel changes made by the Fourth Plenum. He said that if the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing has been suppressed, the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist system have been consolidated, then the Fourth Plenum further stabilized the situation on this basis. Old revolutionary comrades of the proletariat, especially Comrade Deng Xiaoping, played a great role in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion and made important contributions to the success of this plenum.

General Manager of the First Printing Factory of Xi'an, Xu Shoude, said that the communiqué not only played an important role in quickly stabilizing the situation but also pointed out the direction for a long period of work in the future, especially for economic work. The four tasks proposed by this plenum are very important and must be resolutely implemented. From the central to local levels, all leaders must exert great efforts.

President of Northwest University, Zhang Quezhi, and Professor Hou Boyu expressed their support for the resolutions of the Fourth Plenum. They believed that since the smashing of the "Gang of Four," the Party and government cadres and the broad masses of teachers in colleges and universities have made great contributions to the revitalization of China's education. During this turmoil, they worked hard to stabilize the situation in colleges and universities and stop the turmoil. These political and ideological cadres and intellectuals should be correctly evaluated. The deputy secretary of the Party Committee of this university, Dong Dingcheng, and deputy secretary, Liu Shunkang, believed that the communiqué proposed to strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions, which is very important. Only in this way can we unite the majority and isolate and strike a small number, which is beneficial to the stability and unity of the school and the stabilization of the situation.

Chengdu

After the communiqué of the Fourth Plenum was broadcast last night, the cadres and the masses in Chengdu listened and studied it seriously. Deputy Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, Feng Yuanfu, told the reporter that Zhao Ziyang supported the turmoil and split the Party, which is unacceptable to the Party's discipline. Removing all his Party positions is completely correct. Famous economist and President of Southwest University of Finance and Economics, Professor Liu Shibai, said after listening to the communiqué of the Fourth Plenum that this meeting is important because it solved the current very important and urgent problem—the health of the Party's core leadership. Such a team can guarantee the continuity and stability of the line and policies since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee.

Early this morning, the reporter came to Chengdu Radio Factory No. 1. The leaders of the factory were sitting around the television, seriously studying the communiqué of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee. Secretary and General Manager of the Factory Party Committee, Han Jingyun, told the reporter that we firmly support all the resolutions made by the plenum. When reviewing the factory's journey over the past 10 years, he said that 10 years ago, our factory was a loss-making enterprise. It was the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee that pointed out the direction for us and started the economic takeoff. Now we have become one of the major profit-making enterprises in Chengdu and one of the largest TV exporters in the country. Looking back, we feel even more the profound historical significance of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee. We are determined to advance reform and opening up under the guidance of the spirit of the Fourth Plenum.

Wuhan

Today, the leaders of the Hubei Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and various democratic parties held discussion meetings, expressing their support for the spirit of the communiqué of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee.

Last night, Chairman of the Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Huang Zhizhen, called the Xinhua News Agency reporter, expressing his full support for the decisions made by the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee. He said that this counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, planned by domestic and foreign hostile forces, and the turmoil in some places across the country, is a very serious political struggle since the founding of the country, causing serious losses to the Party and the state. This Central Committee plenum will ensure the complete victory of this struggle.

Vice Chairman of the Provincial Committee of the China Democratic League, Ruan Pu, said that hearing the communiqué mention that the line, principles, and policies since the Thirteenth Party Congress remain unchanged, we have taken a tranquilizer. Chairman of the Provincial Committee of the China Revolutionary Committee and Vice Chairman of the Provincial Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Xie Zhi, said that the Central Committee's decision is in line with the will of the people. The struggle to suppress the rebellion is not over yet. We, as non-Party members, should speak the truth to the people overseas, expose the enemy. Secretary-General of the China Democratic League, Zhang Liangcai, said: We should sail through storms with the Communist Party of China, maintain consistency with the Party Central Committee, dispel the doubts of the Taiwanese people with facts, and refute the rumors of the bad guys. Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Wuhan University, Zheng Yongting, said that the Fourth Plenum has ensured that the Party can better implement the line, principles, and policies determined by the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee in the future. Professor Huang Shuxi of Huazhong University of Science and Technology said that as the General Secretary of the Party, Zhao Ziyang wavered in adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, causing confusion in the thoughts of the entire Party. Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Wuhan Water Conservancy and Electric Power College, Gao Jinshan, said that the victory of the Fourth Plenum shows that the Party is strong and powerful. President of Wuhan University, Qi Minyou, believed that the new Party Central Committee is completely trustworthy. President of Wuhan Water Conservancy and Electric Power College, Liu Zhaoyi, believed that Zhao Ziyang's support for the turmoil and split of the Party Central Committee is the inevitable result of his long-term indulgence in bourgeois liberalization and neglect of ideological and political work, causing serious losses to the Party and the state.

Nanjing

Last night, Vice Secretary of the Nanjing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and Mayor of Nanjing, Dai Shunzhi, watched the news on Central Television with other leaders in the city, studying the communiqué of the Central Committee plenum while discussing it. They unanimously expressed their firm support for the decisions made by the Central Committee plenum, believing that the successful convening of the Central Committee plenum marks the further stabilization of the political situation in our country and also shows the unity of our Party. The new Party Central Committee leadership will follow the spirit of the communiqué of the plenum, adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, and persist with reform and opening up. The work below will definitely be done well, and we are full of confidence in this.

Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association and Chairman of the Jiangsu and Nanjing branches, Chen Shuangheng, said that the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee adjusted the central leadership personnel, further clarified the national policies, which will definitely make our country develop better.

Workers of Nanjing Radio Factory, who have maintained normal production since April, expressed their firm support for the decisions made by the Central Committee's Fourth Plenum. Chairman of the Factory Trade Union, Tang Hongqing, said that the plenum added Jiang Zemin, Song Ping, and Li Ruihuan as members of the Politburo Standing Committee, and we support this. They have the ability, achievements, and are worthy of our trust. We must strengthen ideological and political work, fully mobilize the enthusiasm of all employees in the factory, and do a better job according to the requirements of the Fourth Plenum. Deputy Secretary of the Party Committee of Nanjing University, Han Xingshen, said that Comrade Deng Xiaoping asked us to review the past and think about the future. The Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee embodies this spirit. In the future, all Party and government leaders of our school should closely unite around the Party Central Committee, seriously study the speeches of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the documents of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee, and do a good job of ideological and political work for the broad masses of students in a thorough and detailed manner, creating a stable and harmonious teaching environment in the school, and contributing to the stability of the country.

Jinan

Last night, the Shandong Provincial Committee immediately convened an expanded meeting of its Standing Committee after the news of the Fourth Plenum was released, discussing the communiqué of the plenum. The attendees believed that this Central Committee plenum solved the problem of the Party Central Committee's core leadership, which is an important sign of the stabilization of our country. The attendees believed that this Central Committee leadership core has been supplemented with a group of experienced and excellent comrades, and everyone is more confident in achieving the Four Modernizations.

More than 100 college leaders participating in the provincial high-level college work conference in Jinan discussed after listening to and watching the news of the Fourth Plenum. Some comrades immediately returned to their schools to organize teachers and students to study the communiqué of the Fourth Plenum. Many college Party Committee secretaries and presidents talked about how difficult it was to work in schools during the student movement and turmoil. At that time, the Central Committee did not come up with a decisive and handling method for a long time, making us comrades at the grassroots level fall into a dilemma, suffer a lot, and be humiliated. Now it is clear that the key to this situation is that Zhao Ziyang, who holds an important position, supported the turmoil and split the Party. This plenum solved the problem in the Central Committee leadership core, which has far-reaching significance.

Guangzhou

On the evening of June 24, a Guangzhou citizen surnamed Lin called the Xinhua News Agency reporter, expressing his willingness to do a good job in his own post and respond to the call of the plenum. Vice General Manager of the Chinese side of the Sino-foreign joint venture Guangzhou China Hotel, Lu Hongbin, told the reporter that the Fourth Plenum has unified the thoughts of the entire Party, stabilized the leadership team organizationally. The newly adjusted Politburo Standing Committee reflects the revolutionization, youth, and intellectualization of the leadership. Secretary of the South Huaxi Street Party Committee, Han Weiyu, said that South Huaxi Street is a "model unit for spiritual civilization construction" in Guangzhou, and the residents of this street expressed their firm support for the resolutions of the Party's Fourth Plenum. Everyone's personal experience is that spiritual civilization and ideological and political work cannot be relaxed and must be strengthened. Secretary of the Dongshan District Committee of the Communist Party of China, Yu Youjun, said that the Fourth Plenum emphasizes the need to continue to resolutely implement the basic line of "one center, two basic points" determined by the Thirteenth Party Congress, which is very encouraging for us. As we are at the forefront of reform and opening up in Guangzhou, we must work hard and steadfastly to continue to promote the cause of reform, opening up, and construction, and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenum with practical actions.

Old Professor Wang Qi of Sun Yat-sen University and Deputy Dean and Professor of the Graduate School, Huang Tianji, told the reporter that the Central Committee's decision to continue with reform and opening up and not return to the old path of closing the door is in line with the people's hearts. The Central Committee's decision to continue to fight corruption and seriously do a few things that the people are generally concerned about is very meaningful for improving the Party's prestige. General Manager of the Guangzhou Railway Bureau, Yang Qihua, and Deputy General Manager, Song Xiaopeng, expressed their support for the decisions of the Fourth Plenum. They said that during the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, the railway transportation sector was severely affected. Only the lines under the jurisdiction of the Guangzhou Railway Bureau had seven places where transportation was interrupted, causing the Beijing-Guangzhou and Shanghai-Guangzhou lines to be in a semi-paralyzed state. After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, the Guangzhou Railway Bureau is organizing and mobilizing all employees of the bureau to do their best to make up for the losses. It is estimated that by the end of June, the transportation tasks for the first half of the year can be completed. They said that they will definitely follow the requirements of the Fourth Plenum to mobilize all employees of the bureau to do a better job in transportation.

This morning, the Shenzhen Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China held an expanded meeting of its Standing Committee to study the communiqué, unanimously expressing their firm support for the resolutions of the Fourth Plenum and the new leadership team of the Party Central Committee. Secretary of the Municipal Committee, Li Hao, emphasized at the meeting that the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee is a very important meeting. Organizing all cadres and the masses to study and implement the spirit of the communiqué of the Fourth Plenum and the speech of Comrade Deng Xiaoping will have a significant impact on promoting the work of the Special Economic Zone.

    中山大学老教授王起，中山大学研究生院副院长、教授黄天骥对记者说，中央决定继续坚持改革开放，不回头走闭关锁国的老路，很合人心。中央决定坚持惩治腐败，切实做好几件人民普遍关心的事情，这对提高党的威望是很有意义的。广州铁路局局长杨其华和副局长宋小朋表示拥护四中全会的决定。他们说，在北京发生动乱和反革命暴乱期间，铁路运输部门深受其害。仅广州铁路局管辖的线路，就有七处曾发生运输中断，使京广、沪广线处于半瘫痪状态。北京反革命暴乱平息以后，广州路局正组织、发动全路局职工千方百计地把损失夺回来，到６月底预计上半年运输任务可以完成。他们表示，一定按照四中全会提出的要求动员全路局职工把运输工作做得更好。
