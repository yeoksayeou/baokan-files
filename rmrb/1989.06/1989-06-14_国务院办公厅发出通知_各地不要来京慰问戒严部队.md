The State Council Office issued a notice stating that local authorities should not come to Beijing to visit martial law troops.

New China News Agency, Beijing, June 14th: Notice from the State Council Office on Local Authorities Not Coming to Beijing to Visit Martial Law Troops

To the People's Governments of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, and to all departments and directly affiliated institutions of the State Council:

In recent days, the martial law command has continuously received letters (telegrams) of condolences, as well as donations and gifts, from all over the country to the capital's martial law troops. This fully demonstrates the broad masses of the people's support for the Party Central Committee and the State Council's decision to quell the counter-revolutionary riot and stabilize the situation, and it shows the concern and affection of all sectors of society for the soldiers. This is a great encouragement and inspiration to the troops and all military personnel on the front line of martial law. The State Council Office conveys their thanks to the people of the entire nation.

Currently, under the care of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, the martial law troops have ensured the proper supply of all necessary materials, and the injured and sick are gradually recovering. Please rest assured, the people of the whole nation. In recent days, some units outside Beijing have requested to come to Beijing to visit the martial law troops. Given that the task of quelling the counter-revolutionary riot is still arduous, and the work of the martial law troops is extremely demanding, please do not send representatives to Beijing to visit the martial law troops.

We hope that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the people of the entire nation will, through their actual actions of doing a good job in production, work, and maintaining a stable and united situation, express their warm regards to the broad cadres and soldiers of the martial law troops.

State Council Office

　　国务院办公厅发出通知
    各地不要来京慰问戒严部队
    新华社北京６月１４日电  国务院办公厅关于各地不要来京慰问戒严部队的通知
    各省、自治区、直辖市人民政府，国务院各部委、各直属机构：
    近几天来，戒严部队指挥部不断收到全国各地给首都戒严部队发来的慰问信（电）及赠款、赠物，充分体现了广大人民群众对党中央、国务院平息反革命暴乱、稳定局势决策的拥护和支持，体现了社会各界对子弟兵的关怀和爱戴。这对担负戒严任务的部队和全军官兵是很大地激励和鼓舞。国务院办公厅转达他们对全国人民的感谢。
    目前，戒严部队在党中央、国务院、中央军委的关怀下，各项物资供应已得到妥善解决，伤病员身体日渐康复，请全国人民放心。近日来，有些京外单位要求来京慰问戒严部队。鉴于目前平息反革命暴乱的任务仍很艰巨，戒严部队的工作十分繁重，请各地不要派人来北京慰问戒严部队。
    希望全国人民在党中央、国务院的领导下，以搞好生产、做好工作、维护安定团结局势的实际行动，表达对戒严部队广大指战员的亲切慰问。
