Xinhua News Agency, Tianjin, June 4th.

Based on public tips, Tianjin's procuratorial organs have cracked down on two major economic crime cases.

In January, the Baodi County People's Procuratorate in Tianjin received a public tip exposing that the accountant Yang Wenming of the Fangjiazhuang Credit Cooperative in the county had issues with embezzlement. After an investigation, it was confirmed that Yang Wenming, since 1986, had used his position to embezzle over 300,000 yuan through methods such as issuing transfer checks, not recording remittance receipts, falsely increasing income, and forging individual savings. The Tianjin Municipal People's Procuratorate has filed a public prosecution with the Intermediate People's Court.

Recently, the Heping District People's Procuratorate in Tianjin, based on public tips, cracked down on a case of joint embezzlement of over 300,000 yuan. It was found that Jin Wenzhen, the deputy section chief of the Agricultural Machinery Section of the Tianjin Branch of the China Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation, in collusion with the business staff member Lu Yousong, from May to September last year, used methods such as falsely reporting sales revenue and issuing fake invoices. Taking advantage of the company's export of agricultural machinery parts to foreign countries, they reported the actual 210,000 yuan of goods as 480,000 yuan, jointly embezzling 260,000 yuan. They also took advantage of the domestic sales of agricultural machinery products, using the same methods to embezzle over 50,000 yuan.

    天津破获两起重大经济犯罪案
    新华社天津６月４日电  （通讯员赵昭、李恩来）天津市检察机关根据群众举报，破获两起重大经济犯罪案件。
    今年１月，天津市宝坻县人民检察院接到群众举报，揭发这个县方家庄信用社记帐员杨文明有贪污问题。检察部门经过调查，已查实杨文明自１９８６年以来，利用职权，采取开转帐支票、汇款单存根不入帐、虚增收入、伪造个体户存款等手段，非法占有公款３０余万元。天津市人民检察分院已向市中级法院提起公诉。
    前不久，天津市和平区检察院根据群众举报破获一起共同贪污３０余万元的经济犯罪案件。据查实，中国机械设备进出口公司天津分公司农机科副科长金文珍勾结业务员芦有松，从去年５月至９月，采用虚报销售款，开假发票的手法，乘这个公司向国外出口农机配件之便，将实为２１万余元的货款，向公司虚报为４８万余元，共同贪污２６万余元，他们还乘内销农机产品的机会，以同样手段贪污５万多元。
