Title: The Price of Recycled Aluminum Cans Is Too Low

Recently, I visited four waste collection stations in Haidian District, Beijing, and found that there were very few recycled aluminum cans.

Another important channel for recycling aluminum cans is individual collectors. They collect far more aluminum cans than the state-run collection stations. However, due to the low enthusiasm of people selling aluminum cans, a significant number of cans are still being discarded as garbage. The main reason is that the purchase price for aluminum cans is too low.

Aluminum cans are typically 50 to a kilogram. Even if the aluminum factory purchases them at 0.15 yuan per can, 1 ton of recycled aluminum cans would only cost 7,500 yuan. However, producing 1 ton of aluminum for cans requires about 130,000 yuan, and foreign exchange is also needed for imports. In 1988, the United States recycled 42.5 billion aluminum cans, with a recycling rate of 54.6%. It is estimated that the energy required to produce a new can from recycled cans is only 5% of the energy needed from smelting aluminum to producing cans. Undoubtedly, the benefits and significance of recycling aluminum cans are enormous. However, the four collection stations I visited offer only 7 fen, 5 fen, or 3 fen per can, while individual collectors offer only 5 fen per can (they sell to intermediaries for 8 fen). Due to the low purchase price, it is difficult to motivate everyone to participate, resulting in a large number of aluminum cans being discarded. Therefore, I suggest that the state pay attention to the issue of recycling aluminum cans and appropriately increase the purchase price. It is understood that the purchase prices for other waste materials are also too low, significantly impacting waste recycling.

### 废易拉罐回收价太低

　　废易拉罐回收价太低
    最近我走访了北京市海淀区４家废品回收站，发现回收的废易拉罐寥寥无几。
    废易拉罐回收的另一重要渠道是个体收购。他们收上来的废易拉罐比国家收购站要多得多。然而，由于人们卖废易拉罐很不积极，实际上还有相当数量的一批废罐被当作垃圾丢弃了。原因主要是废易拉罐的收购价太低。
    废易拉罐每５０个１公斤，铝厂即使按每个０．１５元收购，１吨废铝罐只需７５００元。而１吨易拉罐用铝材，需１．３万元左右，而且还要用外汇进口。美国１９８８年回收了４２５亿只废铝罐，回收率为５４．６％。据测算，用回收的铝罐制做一只新罐所需的能源只相当于从炼铝到制罐所需能源的５％。毫无疑问，回收废易拉罐的好处和意义是很大的。然而，我走访的４家回收站，收购废易拉罐每个只给７分、５分、３分不等，个体收购者每个只给５分钱（他们卖给中间人是８分）。正是由于回收价太低，很难调动起各方面的积极性，使大批铝材制做的易拉罐白白丢弃。为此，建议国家重视废易拉罐收购这个问题，适当提高收购价格。据了解，其它废品的回收价也都太低，大大影响了废品回收。
