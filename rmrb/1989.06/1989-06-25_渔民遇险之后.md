A common fisherman brother encountered misfortune while fishing in a foreign sea. Unfortunately, his right leg was severed into three parts by the net lifting machine, his liver was split in two, and his life was in danger. However, he miraculously survived...

The news instantly spread from the beautiful Laoshan County to Taolue Town in Rizhao City, and thousands of cadres and masses immediately put their minds at ease. People discussed and spread the news...

Who was the fisherman who encountered danger? How did he escape? Why did this affect so many people's hearts? The authors, with questions in mind, set out on May 4th to find answers in Laoshan County and Rizhao City.

On April 20th, the weather was clear and sunny. Two fishing boats from Haiyuan Village and Zhanzi Village in Taolue Town, Rizhao City, were fishing in the 103 sea area, more than 200 nautical miles away from the mainland. At 12:20 PM, with a sudden "creak," Ye Jingliang's right leg was caught by the steel wire on the net lifting machine and pulled onto the stabilizer. The captain, Li Yongping, was also knocked down. Seeing this, the machine operator quickly pressed the stop button. However, the 29-year-old Ye Jingliang was still wrapped three times by the stabilizer and fell onto the boat, instantly losing consciousness. The fishing boat continued to travel at its fastest speed. After 8 hours, the boat finally reached the military dock in Laoshan County.

It was already past 8 PM. The dock made an exception to let them dock. Two young naval soldiers on duty ran up to help carry Ye Jingliang to the clinic. Stopping the bleeding, giving injections, and dressing the wound, the medical worker Liu quickly finished and reported the situation to the commander.

About 30 minutes later, a car rushed from the brigade headquarters, more than 30 kilometers away. At around 10 PM, Ye Jingliang was sent to the 409th Field Hospital.

Registration, paying the deposit, and completing the hospitalization procedures, all were waived. Saving the person was the priority!

The examination results showed that Ye's right leg bones were severed into three sections, and there was internal bleeding. Emergency surgery was needed. In less than an hour, all the military doctors had arrived. The chief of the medical department convened an emergency meeting to discuss a series of rescue measures and divided into rescue teams. Chief Guo Zhongchang personally directed the operation, picking up the rarely used surgical knife. During the surgery, it was found that Ye's liver was split in two, and there were about 1300 milliliters of blood clots in the abdomen. Only one arterial blood vessel was not severed, and the chances of survival seemed slim. However, the military doctors did not waver in their resolve to save him. As long as there was one chance in ten, they would make every effort. They sucked out the blood clots, sutured the blood vessels, and stitched the liver... Beads of sweat covered the foreheads of the military doctors.

Blood was urgently needed! 13 temporary workers from various places and several cadres and soldiers rushed to the scene after hearing the news. They all extended their arms: "I am type 'O' blood, draw mine..." "..."

1300 milliliters of hot blood from brothers from all over the country flowed drop by drop into Ye Jingliang's veins. Two and a half hours later, the surgery was successfully completed. Perhaps it was the power of the new blood, Ye Jingliang opened his eyes.

Fifteen days after the liver suturing surgery, they performed another surgery on Ye Jingliang's right leg, using steel rods to fix and repair the leg injury with advanced techniques.

In the hospital, the female nurses not only wiped his body and washed his clothes but also sent books and magazines, providing spiritual comfort.

When the news of Ye Jingliang's accident spread from Laoshan County to Taolue Town in Rizhao City, thousands of cadres and masses from Haiyuan Village and Zhanzi Village were very worried. They rushed to Ye Jingliang's home, some bringing money, others bringing nutritional supplies. One person gave 100 yuan, another 50, the least 20 yuan. They turned their deep feelings into practical actions. After Ye's accident, his wife, Xiaozheng, was not at home. The neighbors and young people took the initiative to help with the fields and vegetable garden. The party branch secretary of Haiyuan Village and the village head of Zhanzi Village each brought more than 3000 yuan and nutritional supplies. They came with the hearts of thousands of people.

One person's misfortune touched so many hearts! From these ordinary yet extraordinary deeds, from those warm hands, I found comfort and saw the shining souls of the people.

　　渔民遇险之后
    范奉东　丁元沛
    一位普通的渔民兄弟在异乡海上捕捞时，不幸被起网机把右腿绞成三截，肝破裂成两半，生命垂危。然而，他竟奇迹般地活了……
    这一消息霎时从美丽的崂山县传到了日照市涛雒镇，顿时数千名干部群众悬着的心立刻放下了，人们相互议论着、传告着……
    遇险的渔民是谁？怎样脱险的？为什么牵动着这么多人的心？笔者带着疑问，于５月４日启程奔波在崂山县、日照市寻找着答案。
    ４月２０日，风和日丽，山东省日照市涛雒镇的海员村和栈子三村的两条渔船正在远离大陆２００多海里的１０３海区捕鱼。１２点２０分，随着突然“咯吱”一声巨响，正在收网的叶京亮的右腿被起网机上的钢丝绳绞到稳车上，船长李永平也被推倒了。机手见此情景，迅速按下关闸，然而年仅２９岁的叶京亮还是被稳车绞了三圈，摔在船上，顿时昏死过去。渔船仍以最快的速度行驶着。经过长达８个小时，船才靠到崂山县工大海军码头前边。
    此时，已是晚上８点多了，码头破例让他们靠了上来。两位值班的年轻海军战士跑上来帮着把叶京亮抬到了卫生所。止血、打针，卫生员小刘动作利索地包扎完毕，又打电话把情况向大队长作了汇报。
    大约３０分钟后，汽车就从３０多公里外的团部奔驰而来。１０点多钟，叶京亮被送进４０９野战医院。
    挂号、交押金、办住院手续，一切免减。救人要紧！
    检查结果，小叶右腿骨被绞断三节，内脏出血，急需做手术。不到一个小时，军医们全到齐了。医务处卫主任主持召开了紧急会议，研究了一系列抢救措施，分成了抢救小组，郭新志、张荣奎等主任领着分头行动。主任郭忠昌亲临现场指挥，拿起了轻易不动的手术刀。开刀检查，发现小叶的肝破裂成两半，内脏积存约有１３００毫升血块。只有一根动脉血管没有断裂，生的希望眼看不大了。然而，军医们丝毫没有动摇挽救的信心。只要有一分希望，也要做十分努力。清吸血块，接血管，用针缝肝……豆大的汗珠布满了军医们的额头。
    急需输血！１３个住在此地的外来的临时工和数名干部战士闻讯后赶来了。他们纷纷伸出了胳膊：“我是‘Ｏ’型血，抽我的……”“……”
    １３００毫升来自五湖四海兄弟的热血，一滴滴地流入了叶京亮的血管里。两个半小时过去了，手术顺利完毕。也许是注入新的热血的力量，叶京亮睁开了双眼。
    肝缝合手术１５天后，他们又给叶京亮右腿作了手术，用钢筋穿扒固定，用高超的技术接治腿伤。
    在医院里，女护士不仅给他擦身子、洗衣服，还送书、送杂志，从精神上关怀他。
    当叶京亮遇险的消息从崂山县传到日照市涛雒镇后，海员村和栈子三村的数千名干部群众非常着急，他们纷纷涌到叶京亮家，有的带着钱，有的带着营养物品，你１００，他５０，最少的２０元，他们把深厚的感情化作了实际行动。小叶出事后，妻子小郑不在家，责任田、菜园里的活儿，邻居和青年们主动帮助干了起来。海员村的党支部书记、栈子三村的村主任分别带着３０００多元钱和营养物品来了。他们带着数千群众的心意来了。
    一人遇险，牵动着多少人的心呀！从那一件件平凡而又不平凡的事情中，从那一双热情的双手上，我得到了一种慰藉，同时也看到了人们闪光的灵魂。
