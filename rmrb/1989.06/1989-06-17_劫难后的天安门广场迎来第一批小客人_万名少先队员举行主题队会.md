Today morning, 10,000 Young Pioneers from the capital and 1,000 soldiers from the People's Liberation Army gathered at Tiananmen Square to solemnly hold a themed meeting titled "Love the Party, Love Socialist Motherland."

The majestic Tiananmen Square appeared even more solemn and spacious today. The five-star red flag fluttered in the wind, and in the blue sky, four large colorful balloons floated, each bearing a banner: "Long Live the Great Communist Party of China," "Long Live the Great Socialist Motherland," "Long Live the Great People's Liberation Army," and "Uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and Reform and Opening Up."

At 9:30 AM, Li Ximing, Chen Xitong, Xiong Guangkai, and Yang Baibing came to Tiananmen Square. Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong, on behalf of the municipal party committee, municipal government, and all the people of Beijing, extended warm congratulations to the Young Pioneers.

"You are the first batch of young visitors to the square after the calamity," Chen Xitong said. The future is limitless and beautiful, and it belongs to you. Building a modernized socialist powerhouse requires the unremitting efforts of several generations. The beautiful future also needs you to create and build.

Beijing Military Region Commander Zhou Yibing, on behalf of the martial law troops, extended warm congratulations to the Young Pioneers.

During the themed meeting, Li Ximing, Chen Xitong, Xiong Guangkai, and Yang Baibing inspected the Beijing Municipal China Youth League Honor Guard. Subsequently, the Young Pioneers laid wreaths in honor of the PLA, armed police officers, and public security personnel who heroically sacrificed their lives in quelling the counter-revolutionary rebellion. They also presented red scarves to the representatives of the martial law troops. The Young Pioneers also exchanged gifts with the PLA soldiers.

After the meeting, the Comrades-in-Arms Dance Troupe, along with the Young Pioneers and martial law troops, held a joint celebration. The Young Pioneers and the martial law troops also visited the Tiananmen Gate Tower.
