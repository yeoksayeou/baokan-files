	A Calligrapher from the Mountains Steps onto the World Stage
	Wáng Lìqīng

	Just before the Spring Festival, a piece of explosive news spread through the city of Yuǎn'ān County in the western mountains of Hubei: Wáng Ānlái was elected as a standing director of the Suspended Ink Calligraphy Department of the World Calligraphers Association.

	Wáng Ānlái is a cultural officer at the county cultural center, having worked in music and cultural arts for many years. He is also a calligrapher with considerable achievements, whose works have won numerous awards in national and provincial competitions.

	Last summer, he invented "Suspended Ink Calligraphy." This term refers to a new type of calligraphy technique that involves suspended point-drawing. It does not use any absorbent media but instead uses a discarded plastic glue bottle filled with ink. A needle tube or medical syringe needle (referred to as the "Suspended Ink Calligraphy Tool") is installed at the bottle cap. The bottle is then inverted, and the ink is squeezed out to draw freely. This technique was inspired by everyday life experiences such as leaks from the roof, water dripping from a spout, using a watering can, and children playing with water guns. It aims to pursue new pleasures, new artistic conceptions, and new aesthetic experiences.

	In April of last year, the organizing committee of the National First Calligraphy and Painting Awards and the Chinese Calligraphy and Painting Society received Wáng Ānlái's "Suspended Ink" calligraphy works, including "Golden Dragon" (cursive script), "Suspended Ink" (running script), "My China" (seal script), as well as the calligraphy essays "On Suspended Ink" and "On the Golden Ratio Beauty of Regular Script Structure." After evaluation by national calligraphy and painting experts, it was unanimously recognized and decided that Wáng Ānlái's calligraphy works and essays have certain artistic value and represent a significant breakthrough in innovation. The Chinese Calligraphy and Painting Society appointed him as a researcher. The president of the Chinese Calligraphy Academy and the Chinese Calligraphy and Painting Society, Hé Zhì, personally wrote an inscription for him: "Thousands of years of national arts, all passed down by masters. The calligraphy association builds the spirit of the nation, ascending to the ninth heaven."

	On December 12, 1988, at the meeting of the World Calligraphers Association held in Canada, Wáng Ānlái's independently created "Suspended Ink Calligraphy" was affirmed by international experts. The conference passed a resolution to specially establish the "Suspended Ink Calligraphy Department" and elected Wáng Ānlái as a standing director of the Suspended Ink Calligraphy Department of the World Calligraphers Association. It was suggested that he establish the "Suspended Ink Calligraphy Art School" as soon as possible to enroll students both domestically and internationally.

　　山沟书法家走上大世界
    王丽清
    春节前夕，鄂西山区的远安县城传出一条爆炸性的新闻：王安来当选为世界书法家协会悬墨书法部常务理事。
    王安来是县文化馆音乐干部，从事音乐文化艺术工作多年。他也是一位颇有造诣的书法研究者，作品多次在全国和省级比赛中获奖。
    去年初夏，他独创“悬墨书法”。所谓“悬墨”，是一种悬空点画而成的新型书法技术。它从“笔”的王国里脱颖而出，不用任何吸墨媒介，而只用一个废塑料胶水瓶装墨。在瓶口盖部安一针管或医用注射器针头（谓之“悬墨书法器”），倒悬，捏瓶，即可任意点画。它是从屋漏之痕、喇口吐水、用喷水壶洒水、儿童玩用水枪……等现实生活中孕育而萌生的一种独特书法方式，意在追求一种新的乐趣、新的意境和新的美感。
    去年４月，全国首届书画大奖赛组委会和中国书画社收到王安来创作的“悬墨”书法作品《金龙》（草书）、《悬墨》（行书）、《我的中国》（篆书）以及《论悬墨》和《论楷书结体的黄金分割美》等书法论文，经全国书画专家评审后，一致确认并作出决定：王安来的书法作品及论文，具有一定的艺术价值，在出新上有着重大的突破。中国书画社聘请他担任研究员。中国书法学院院长、中国书画社社长郝治先生为他亲笔贺作墨宝：“民族技艺几千年，皆靠师傅把手传。书坛书协建国魂，更上九重天。”
    １９８８年１２月１２日，在加拿大召开的世界书法家协会机构成员选举会上，王安来所独创的“悬墨书法”博得国际上专家的肯定。大会通过专门增设“悬墨书法部”的决定，并推选王安来为世界书法家协会悬墨书法部常务理事，建议他尽早创办“悬墨书法艺校”，在国内外广收学员。
