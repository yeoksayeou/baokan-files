Kim Dae-jung, a leader of the opposition parties in South Korea, again called on May 29 for the authorities to prosecute the key figures responsible for the suppression of the Gwangju People's Uprising, including the "Special Operations Commander" Chung Ho-yun.

Kim Dae-jung stated that addressing the key figures involved in the suppression of the Gwangju People's Uprising is a crucial step in thoroughly settling the legacy of the evil regime of Chun Doo-hwan. If Roh Tae-woo fails to resolve these issues, the opposition parties will mobilize the public to conduct an "interim evaluation" of Roh Tae-woo next February.

During the 1987 South Korean elections, Roh Tae-woo had promised that if elected, he would implement an "interim evaluation." If he did not pass this evaluation, he would resign from the presidency.

　　金大中再次呼吁
    法办镇压光州起义元凶
    本报平壤电  记者徐宝康报道：汉城消息，南朝鲜在野党领导人金大中５月２９日再次呼吁，当局应法办镇压光州人民起义的核心人物“特遣司令官”郑浩溶。
    金大中说，处理镇压光州人民起义的核心人物，是彻底清算全斗焕统治时期罪恶的“隐患”，如果卢泰愚不能解决这些问题，明年２月，在野党将发动民众对卢泰愚进行“中间评价”。
    １９８７年南朝鲜大选时，卢泰愚曾许诺，一旦他当选，将实施“中间评价”，如果在“中间评价”时没有通过他将辞掉总统职务。
