The Chinese Association for Science and Technology held a meeting of its chairpersons and vice-chairpersons on May 30 to study and discuss important speeches by central leaders such as Li Peng and Yang Shangkun. The meeting focused on the current situation of stopping the turmoil and stabilizing the situation.

The meeting was presided over by Chairman Qian Xuesen. Vice-chairpersons Wang Da-hung, Zhu Guangya, Wu Jieping, Zhang Wei, Qian Sanqiang, Gao Zhenning, Tang Aoqing, and Qiu Weifan, as well as Secretary-General Gao Chao, Li Baoheng, and Cao Lingzhong of the Secretariat, attended the meeting.

The attendees unanimously agreed that the patriotic enthusiasm of the young students in the capital, who demanded to oppose "official profiteering," punish corruption, and promote democracy, is in line with the wishes of the older generation of scientists and technologists. However, the facts of the past month have shown that the problem is complex and requires a calm and rational scientific analysis. Due to the interference of a few individuals who deliberately created turmoil, the situation has led to anarchy and chaos, seriously disrupting social order, work order, teaching and research order, and the lives of the people. At this critical moment, the Party Central Committee and the State Council have made major decisions and taken decisive measures to stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation. We firmly support these measures and believe that as long as we adhere to the principle of "facts as the basis and the Constitution and laws as the criterion" to unify our thinking, we will definitely be able to maintain a stable and united situation and ensure the smooth progress of reform, opening up, and socialist modernization.

Many senior scientists mentioned that as lifelong fighters for science and democracy, we deeply feel that in the new era of reform and opening up, we must, while developing the economy and striving for a scientific and technological power, strive to strengthen the construction of socialist democracy and the rule of law. Although our country has made great achievements in various aspects over the past 40 years since its founding, the construction of democracy and the rule of law is still very weak. Coupled with mistakes in work, the failure to curb "official profiteering" and corruption has already damaged the enthusiasm of the people to participate in reform and construction. The Party and the government have repeatedly stated that the reasonable demands of the students are consistent with the goals of the Party and the government. We sincerely hope that all levels of Party and government departments will truly improve their work, strengthen consultation and dialogue, establish and improve various mechanisms for democratic political construction, fully play the supervisory role of people's congresses at all levels over government departments, and the political consultative role of people's political consultative conferences at all levels. We should also strengthen the construction of the rule of law and resolutely crack down on "official profiteering" and corruption. This is not only necessary for deepening reform but also for enhancing the cohesion of the entire nation and adhering to the four cardinal principles.

Everyone also believed that democracy and the rule of law should promote each other and that democracy should be promoted on the track of the rule of law. Some senior scientists said, "During the December 9th Movement, we also participated in marches and petitions. At that time, the country was facing imperialist aggression, and the government pursued a policy of non-resistance, with the nation facing extinction. Today, the times have changed. We demand the construction of democratic politics, which should and can be done on the track of the rule of law. Taking actions such as hunger strikes is not scientific and will only lead to anarchy. We have suffered enough from the decade of turmoil and hope that the broad masses of students will cherish their study time, return to school as soon as possible, and strive to master cultural and scientific knowledge. We should learn to build our country on the track of democracy and the rule of law and shoulder the historical mission entrusted to us.

The attendees finally mentioned that in the old China, many scientists had the good wish of "science saving the country," but history has proven that only under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people of the whole country can carry out revolutionary struggles to establish a new China where the people are the masters. Today, we want to build modernization and achieve the goal of a scientific and technological power, which must also be done under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and follow the socialist road. We must adhere to the four cardinal principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization. The Association for Science and Technology should play a bridging role, promote consultation and dialogue, promote scientific decision-making, and better play its role in revitalizing science and technology education, promoting democratic political construction, and strengthening socialist spiritual civilization construction. We are deeply convinced that the Party and the government have the ability to eliminate corruption, that socialism will definitely show strong vitality, and that the reform and construction of our country will definitely be better.

### 中国科协举行主席会议拥护中央决策  在法制轨道上促进民主建设

　　中国科协举行主席会议拥护中央决策
    在法制轨道上促进民主建设
    新华社北京６月１日电  中国科学技术协会消息：５月３０日，中国科协在北京举行主席、副主席会议，学习、讨论李鹏、杨尚昆等中央领导同志的重要讲话，就当前制止动乱、稳定局势的大局，进行了认真的座谈。
    会议由钱学森主席主持，在京副主席王大珩、朱光亚、吴阶平、张维、钱三强、高镇宁、唐敖庆、裘维蕃及中国科协书记处书记高潮、李宝恒、曹令中出席了会议。
    与会同志一致认为，首都青年学生出于爱国热情，提出反对“官倒”、惩治腐败和促进民主的要求，这与我们老一代科技工作者的愿望是一致的。但一个月来的事实告诉我们，问题是复杂的，需要冷静、理智地进行科学分析。由于极少数人从中插手，蓄意制造动乱，导致无政府状态和混乱局面，严重地干扰了社会秩序、工作秩序、教学科研秩序和人民群众的生活秩序。在这关键时刻，党中央、国务院采取了重大决策和果断措施，坚决制止动乱、稳定局势，我们坚决拥护，并相信，只要坚持“以事实为根据，以宪法和法律为准绳”统一思想，就一定能维护安定团结的局面，保障改革、开放和社会主义现代化建设事业顺利进行。
    许多老科学家谈到，作为一生为科学和民主而奋斗的老同志，我们深感在改革、开放的新时期，一定要在发展经济和科技兴国的同时，努力加强社会主义民主和法制的建设。我国是一个有着长期封建统治和传统影响的国家，建国４０年来虽然在各方面取得了很大的成就，但民主与法制的建设仍然非常薄弱，加上工作中的失误，对“官倒”和腐败现象制止不力，已经损害了人民群众投身改革、建设的积极性。党和政府已多次表示，学生提出的合理要求与党和政府的目标是一致的，我们真诚希望各级党、政部门切实改进工作，加强协商对话，建立和完善各种民主政治建设的机制，充分发挥各级人大对政府部门的监督作用，以及各级政协的政治协商作用，并大力加强法制建设，对“官倒”和腐败现象下决心动大手术。这不仅是深化改革的需要，也是增强全民族的凝聚力、坚持四项基本原则的需要。
    大家还认为，民主与法制应相互促进，一定要在法制的轨道上促进民主建设。有的老科学家说，“一二·九”时我们也参加过游行请愿，那时候国家遇到帝国主义侵略，政府奉行不抵抗政策，民族处于存亡关头。今天时代不同了，我们要求建设民主政治，应该也完全可能在法制的轨道上进行。采取绝食等方式，是不科学的，只会导致无政府状态。我们饱尝十年动乱之苦，希望广大学生珍惜学习时间，尽快返校复课，努力掌握文化科学知识，学会在民主和法制的轨道上建设我们的国家，承担起历史赋予的重任。
    与会同志最后谈到，旧中国有许多科学家抱有“科学救国”的良好愿望，但历史证明，只有中国共产党领导全国人民进行革命斗争，才能建立起人民当家作主的新中国。今天我们要建设现代化，实现科技兴国，也必须在中国共产党的领导下，走社会主义的道路。一定要坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化。科协组织要发挥纽带桥梁作用，促进协商对话，促进科学决策，在振兴科技教育、推进民主政治建设和加强社会主义精神文明建设中更好地发挥作用。我们深信，党和政府有能力清除腐败现象，社会主义一定能焕发出强大的生命力，我们国家的改革和建设事业一定能办得更好。
