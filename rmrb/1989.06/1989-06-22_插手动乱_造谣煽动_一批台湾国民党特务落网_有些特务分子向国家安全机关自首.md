	Meddling in Turmoil and Spreading Rumors
	A Batch of Kuomintang Spies Arrested
	Some Spy Elements Surrender to State Security Agencies

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 22 – State Security Department information: After thorough investigations, state security agencies across the country have uncovered a series of cases involving Kuomintang spies from Taiwan who have been meddling in the disturbances in Beijing and other places since mid-April. A large amount of evidence of spy activities has been seized.

	The Kuomintang spy agencies in Taiwan have been using various channels and methods to incite so-called "freedom and democracy movements" on the mainland, aiming to create social unrest and overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship of the People's Republic of China. Since the disturbances in Beijing and other places, the Kuomintang spy agencies have been intensifying their efforts to spread rumors and incite unrest, misleading the public. They have also instructed their spies infiltrated on the mainland to directly meddle in the disturbances, exacerbate the situation, and turn the so-called "democratic movement" on the mainland into a full-scale "anti-communist resistance movement." They have also arranged for infiltrated spies to closely monitor and gather information about the disturbances and report it to overseas spy units.

	The counter-revolutionary activities of these infiltrated Kuomintang spies have been successively uncovered by our state security agencies. Some Kuomintang spies who meddled in the disturbances have surrendered to our state security agencies. The following are some of the uncovered Kuomintang spy cases:

	The Beijing Municipal State Security Bureau detained Kuomintang spies Wang Changhong, Qian Rongmian, and Liang Qiang on May 19 and May 27, respectively, in accordance with the law.

	Spy Wang Changhong, male, 38 years old, was originally a cadre in a factory in Beijing. In 1988, he was recruited by the "Mainland Work Committee" of the Kuomintang in a foreign country and joined a spy organization. After the disturbances in Beijing, the Taiwan spy agency appointed Wang Changhong as a "provincial special envoy," instructing him to return to Beijing to gather information about the disturbances and secretly establish a "Beijing Work Committee." After returning to Beijing on April 27, Wang Changhong immediately recruited Qian Rongmian, a cadre in a factory in Beijing, as a spy and secretly reported the domestic disturbances to the Taiwan spy agency. He also spread rumors and incited disturbances several times on Tiananmen Square, saying things like "The government really has no humanity, what's the point of having such a government!" and "The police in Xi'an killed dozens of students." Wang Changhong also reported to the Taiwan spy agency that "the current focus should be on labor movements," attempting to incite strikes and further escalate the disturbances. After the case was uncovered, evidence such as the code used by Wang Changhong to communicate with the Taiwan spy agency was seized.

	Spy Liang Qiang, male, 36 years old, was originally a cadre in a factory in Beijing. In 1986, during his studies abroad, he joined the "Mainland Work Committee" spy organization of the Kuomintang and was appointed as a "central special envoy" to return to the mainland. The Taiwan spy agency instructed him to develop organizations among intellectuals after returning to the country. After the disturbances in Beijing, Liang Qiang frequently went to various universities and Tiananmen Square to stir up trouble, participated in the disturbances, and wrote reactionary propaganda materials for the illegal organizations "High Autonomy Federation" and "Foreign Autonomy Federation." He also drafted the "Declaration of the Chinese Unity Party," claiming to establish another "government," and frequently reported his activities to the Taiwan spy agency.

	The Shanghai Municipal State Security Bureau detained Kuomintang spies Qiu Lin and Zhou Yan, Cao Weiguo, Feng Jin, and Lu Zhengqing on June 7 and June 14, respectively, in accordance with the law.

	Spy Qiu Lin, male, 30 years old, was originally a reporter for a newspaper. In 1986, he settled abroad and in 1988 joined the spy organization of the Taiwan Military Intelligence Bureau abroad. He was soon dispatched back to the mainland to carry out activities. During the disturbances in Shanghai, the Taiwan spy agency repeatedly instructed him to "utilize the new situation of opposition between students and the Communist Party to mobilize the public to support the student movement, expanding the student movement towards the direction of overthrowing the Communist Party's rule." Qiu Lin, according to the spy agency's arrangements, went out to activities, participated in "salon" gatherings, and frequently reported the disturbances to the spy agency. After the case was uncovered, evidence such as the secret writing tools and drafts of secret letters used by Qiu Lin were seized.

	Spy Zhou Yan, male, 23 years old, was originally a worker in a company in Shanghai. In 1988, during his self-funded study abroad, he joined the spy organization of the Taiwan Military Intelligence Bureau. He was soon dispatched back to the mainland to gather intelligence. Cao Weiguo, Feng Jin, and Lu Zhengqing also joined the Taiwan spy organization through Zhou Yan. In late April this year, the Taiwan spy agency instructed Zhou Yan to "seize the current situation, participate in the student movement, and report the results." Zhou Yan then, together with Feng Jin, Cao Weiguo, Lu Zhengqing, and others, actively participated in activities. They reported to the Taiwan spy agency that "we have formed a team to march and support students, with the slogan 'I love money, but I love democracy and freedom even more,'" and "we appear as individual business owners, which has a great promotional effect on the march, has a great appeal to the public, and has caused a great impact." After the case was uncovered, evidence such as the secret letters issued by the Taiwan spy agency to Zhou Yan and others were seized.

	The Guangdong Provincial State Security Bureau detained Taiwan Military Intelligence Bureau spies Zhang Yi and Wu Jidong on June 14 in accordance with the law and seized evidence of their spy activities. Zhang Yi, male, 25 years old, is a jobless youth; Wu Jidong, male, 23 years old, was originally a worker in a hotel in Guangzhou. Zhang Yi and Wu Jidong were recruited by the Taiwan Military Intelligence Bureau in November 1988 and joined the spy organization. During the disturbances in Guangzhou, Zhang and Wu, according to the instructions of the Taiwan spy agency, received and spread rumors fabricated by the Taiwan Broadcasting Station, incited disturbances, and frequently reported the disturbances in Beijing and Guangzhou to the Taiwan spy agency.

	With the close cooperation of state security agencies in Gansu and other places, the State Security Agency of the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region detained Taiwan Military Intelligence Bureau spy Gao Xiaoshi on June 2 in accordance with the law and seized evidence such as secret writing tools. Gao Xiaoshi, male, 32 years old, originally worked in a cultural troupe in Ningxia. In 1988, he joined the spy organization of the Taiwan Military Intelligence Bureau abroad and was dispatched back to the mainland to carry out spy activities. According to the arrangements of the Taiwan spy agency, he actively gathered information about domestic disturbances and secretly reported the reactionary leaflets collected during the disturbances to the Taiwan spy agency.

	Taiwan Military Intelligence Bureau spy Qu Zuojie recently surrendered to our state security agency. Qu Zuojie, male, 26 years old, was originally a worker in a factory in Shenyang. In March 1989, he joined the spy organization of the Taiwan Military Intelligence Bureau abroad. After disturbances occurred in the country, the Taiwan spy agency immediately dispatched him to infiltrate the country, develop organizations, and incite "student movements." Qu Zuojie's activities after entering the country have been under the strict surveillance of our state security agencies. Fearing the power of the people and the state security agencies, he surrendered to the Liaoning Provincial State Security Bureau on May 25, confessing his mission this time and handing over the spy activity tools he carried.

	The uncovered spy cases are currently under investigation. Spy elements who surrender will be treated leniently after examination and education.

　　插手动乱　造谣煽动    
    一批台湾国民党特务落网    
    有些特务分子向国家安全机关自首
    新华社北京６月２２日电  国家安全部消息：各地国家安全机关经过严密侦查，破获了一批自４月中旬以来插手北京等地学潮和动乱的台湾国民党特务案件，缴获了大量特务活动的罪证。
    台湾国民党特务机关一直在通过各种渠道，使用各种手段，煽动大陆的所谓“自由民主运动”，阴谋制造社会动乱，颠覆中华人民共和国的人民民主政权。自从北京等地出现学潮和动乱后，台湾国民党特务机关在加紧对大陆进行造谣煽动、蛊惑人心的反革命宣传的同时，指使潜伏在大陆的特务分子直接插手动乱，扩大事态，以图使大陆的这场所谓“民主运动”扩大为全面的“反共抗暴运动”。他们还布置潜伏特务密切注视和搜集动乱情况，报送境外特务单位。
    台湾国民党潜伏特务的这些反革命活动陆续被我国家安全机关侦破，有些插手动乱的台湾国民党特务已向我国家安全机关投案自首。现将破获的部分台湾国民党特务案件公布于后：
