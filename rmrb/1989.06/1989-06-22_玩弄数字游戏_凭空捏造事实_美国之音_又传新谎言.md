	Manipulating Numbers and Fabricating Facts:
	"Voice of America" Spreads New Lies

	New China News Agency, Beijing, June 22—After Chinese authorities repeatedly refuted the "Voice of America's" fabricated claim that the People's Liberation Army "killed 3,000 people in Tiananmen Square" with specific facts, the "Voice of America" has changed its tune. It cited a report from a New York Times reporter in Beijing, acknowledging that there is no substantial evidence to support the claim of "thousands of civilians being killed." It stated that this reporter believed the number of people who died during the entire process of suppressing the riot was "in the hundreds."

	However, according to the broadcast, while this New York Times reporter named Christopher filled in a gap for the "Voice of America," he simultaneously made bold assumptions, manipulated numbers, and fabricated new lies. In his report, he said, "Perhaps thousands of people were killed, but there are no traces left," and claimed to have "reliable" information that "in the eight hospitals closest to the suppression sites, the number of deaths was 184 people," but "in the following days, there must have been some seriously injured people who died, so the number of deaths in these hospitals should be over 200." He also said that "if the number of deaths in the other 12 hospitals is calculated at 10 people per hospital, then the total would be approximately 120 deaths," and "if the other 20 hospitals average two deaths per hospital, the total would be around 40 people." This reporter added up the above numbers, concluding that the total number of deaths in the hospitals was "approximately 360 people." He further stated that "there were also some people whose bodies were taken away by students or friends. If these people are included, the death toll could reach four or five hundred people," and so on. He also cited an unnamed foreign reporter, saying that on June 4 during the clearance, "it seemed that several dozen workers and a few students were left in the square," and if these people were killed by the military and their bodies burned, the death toll would increase by several dozen, or even several hundred people.

	Relevant authorities here pointed out that this reporter was essentially writing a detective novel rather than a news report. The "Voice of America's" attempt to continue slandering the Chinese government through spreading such lies is clearly evident.

### 玩弄数字游戏　凭空捏造事实  “美国之音”又传新谎言

　　玩弄数字游戏　凭空捏造事实    
    “美国之音”又传新谎言
    新华社北京６月２２日电  在中国有关方面多次列举具体事实驳斥“美国之音”制造的所谓解放军“在天安门广场打死３０００人”的谎言之后，“美国之音”今天改了口。它援引《纽约时报》记者发自北京的一则报道，承认所谓“杀害平民达数千人”一事“得不到有力的证据证明”。它说，这个记者认为在平息暴乱整个过程中死亡的人数“是好几百人”。
    但是据广播，《纽约时报》这个名叫克里斯托夫的记者在他的报道中虽然为“美国之音”补了一下漏洞，却同时又大胆假设，玩弄数字游戏，捏造新的谎言。他在报道中说，“或许有几千人遭到杀害，但都没有留下痕迹”，又说他有“可靠”资料，什么“在八个最靠近镇压地点的医院里，死亡的人数是１８４人”，但“在后来的几天中，一定还有一些受重伤的人不治死亡，所以这几家医院的死亡人数应该在两百以上”；“另外１２家医院的死亡人数如果以每家１０个人计算，那么总共大约有１２０人死亡”，“其他２０家医院如果平均每家有两个人死亡，总数就有４０人左右”。这个记者把以上的数字加起来，得出医院死亡总数“大约在３６０人左右”。他又说什么“还有一些被杀害的人尸体被学生或朋友带走了。如果把这些人加进去，死亡人数可能会达到四五百人”，等等。他还援引一个没有姓名的所谓外国记者的话，说什么６月４日清场时，最后“好像有几十个工人和少数学生留在广场”，“如果这些人被军队杀害，而且尸体被烧毁，那死亡人数再加上几十人”，又说“甚至有几百人”被杀害后尸体遭到烧毁。
    此间有关人士指出，这个记者简直是在写推理小说而不是在作新闻报道。而“美国之音”企图通过传播这样的谎言来继续诬蔑中国政府的卑鄙用心，昭然若揭。
