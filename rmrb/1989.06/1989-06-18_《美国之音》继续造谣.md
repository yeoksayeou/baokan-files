	Voice of America Continues to Spread Rumors

	New China News Agency, Beijing, June 17 - Relevant authorities here pointed out that Voice of America today resorted to deception, continuing to spread the lie that the People's Liberation Army "bloodily suppressed" Tiananmen Square, attacking China. Voice of America also openly criticized the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court's decision to sentence three arsonists who set fire to trains to death.

	Voice of America said in today's broadcast: "The Chinese government is trying to make people believe that no one was killed when the army entered Beijing on the night of June 3."

	Relevant authorities pointed out that Voice of America is again fabricating lies. The Chinese government has never said that no one was killed in the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots that occurred in Beijing from June 3 to 4. On June 6, State Council spokesperson Yuan Mu had already announced the casualties during the suppression of the riots at a press conference, stating that after verification, among the nearly 300 people who died, there were soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, a small number of criminals who deserved their fate, and a few innocent civilians and students who were accidentally injured. Regarding the situation in Tiananmen Square, Zhang Gong, the political department director of a certain unit of the martial law troops, who attended the press conference, introduced that during the clearing of Tiananmen Square, no one was killed, and the students left the square in an organized manner from the southeast corner of the square.

	Chinese news agencies have repeatedly broadcast the live footage of the clearing of Tiananmen Square at that time and interviews with eyewitnesses to confirm the introductions by Yuan Mu and Zhang Gong.

	However, Voice of America and other Western and Hong Kong-Taiwan news agencies have ignored these facts and fabricated rumors out of thin air, claiming that the People's Liberation Army "bloodily suppressed" Tiananmen Square and killed 1,400 to 3,000 people. They also claim to have on-site video footage. Relevant authorities said, if that is the case, why doesn't Voice of America and others bring out your on-site video footage of Tiananmen Square from that day to prove that the shocking numbers you spread are not lies?

	Relevant authorities pointed out that Voice of America today released a conversation with an American student named Klaus David who supposedly just returned to the United States from China, attempting to substantiate their lies. This 18-year-old American student studying at Beijing Normal University said that a "freedom newspaper reporter" from Beijing Normal University ran back to the school from Tiananmen Square to tell him that this "reporter's" "friends in Tiananmen Square were all run over by tanks and shot dead." Voice of America took this American youth's hearsay as "witnessing the events in Tiananmen Square with their own eyes," which is truly unscrupulous.

	On June 15, the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court sentenced three criminals who set fire to 9 train carriages, 6 police motorcycles, and 900 bags of mail, and assaulted public security and firefighting personnel to death. Regarding these criminals who were caught red-handed with solid evidence, Voice of America, as the mouthpiece of the U.S. government, today quoted White House spokesman Fitzwater, calling them "exercisers of basic human rights" and considering their death sentence "regrettable."

	Relevant authorities here pointed out that burning trains and mail has become "exercising basic human rights" in the eyes of Voice of America and the White House spokesman, which is truly absurd! If American law considers these atrocities to be "basic human rights," then go ahead and "exercise" them in the United States, but this will not work in China.

### 《美国之音》继续造谣

　　《美国之音》继续造谣
    新华社北京６月１７日电  此间有关人士指出，《美国之音》今天偷梁换柱，继续散布所谓解放军“血洗”天安门广场的谎言，攻击中国。《美国之音》还公然对上海判处３名纵火焚烧列车的歹徒死刑横加指责。
    《美国之音》在今天的广播中说：“中国政府企图使人相信：在军队６月３日晚上开进北京的时候，没有一个人被打死。”
    有关人士指出，《美国之音》又在制造谎言。中国政府从来没有说过在平息６月３日至４日北京发生的反革命暴乱中没有死一个人。国务院发言人袁木早在６月６日的记者招待会上就已公布了平息暴乱中的伤亡情况，并说经过核实，在死亡的近３００人中包括解放军官兵、罪有应得的一小撮歹徒和少数误伤的市民和学生。至于天安门广场的情况，出席记者招待会的戒严部队某部政治部主任张工曾介绍说，在清理天安门广场的过程中，没有一人被打死，学生是比较有组织地打着旗从广场的东南角离开了广场。
    中国的新闻机构已多次播放了当时天安门广场清场的实况录像和目击者的谈话来证实袁木和张工的介绍。
    但《美国之音》以及其他西方和港台新闻机构却无视这一事实，无中生有地散布谣言说，解放军“血洗”了天安门广场，并打死了１４００人至３０００人，他们还声称有现场录像。有关人士说，既然如此，《美国之音》等为什么不把你们的当天天安门广场现场录像拿出来证明你们所散布的耸人听闻的数字不是谎言呢？
    有关人士指出，《美国之音》今天抛出了一个所谓“刚从中国回到美国”的克莱斯·大卫的美国留学生的谈话，想来证实自己的谎言。这位１８岁的在北师大留学的美国学生说什么“一个当自由报纸记者”的北师大学生从天安门广场跑回学校告诉他说，这位“记者”的“在天安门的朋友都被坦克压死了，打死了。”《美国之音》把这位美国青年道听途说的谣言说成是“亲眼看到了北京天安门广场发生的事情”，未免太不择手段了。
    上海市中级人民法院１５日依法判处３名放火焚烧９节列车车厢、６辆警用摩托车和９００袋邮件、殴打公安消防人员的歹徒死刑。对于这些证据确凿、在现场擒获的歹徒，作为美国政府喉舌的《美国之音》，今天却援引白宫发言人菲茨沃特的话，把他们说成是“运用基本人权的人”，认为对他们判处死刑“是可悲的”。
    此间有关人士指出，焚烧列车和邮件在《美国之音》和白宫发言人的心目中竟然成了“运用基本人权”，真是太荒唐了！如果美国的法律认为这些暴行是什么“基本人权”，那你们就尽管在美国去“运用”吧，这在中国是丝毫也行不通的。
