Party and state leaders Li Peng, Qiao Shi, and Yao Yilin this afternoon met with the families of martyrs Liu Guangen, Cui Guozheng, and Li Guorui, who sacrificed their lives in the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital.

Li Peng, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Premier of the State Council, on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, extended cordial greetings to the families of the three martyrs and to the families of other martyrs who sacrificed their lives in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot.

At 4:30 PM, when the families of the martyrs arrived at the Ziguang Pavilion, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, and Yao Yilin shook hands with them one by one and introduced the other party and government leaders present to them.

Li Peng said, "The martyrs' heroic sacrifice has made us deeply saddened. On this occasion, I would like to express my profound condolences to all the soldiers and police officers of the People's Liberation Army and the Public Security Bureau who sacrificed their lives in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital, and to extend my cordial greetings to the families of all the martyrs."

Li Peng said, "The martyrs' sacrifice is a great contribution to the people, a great contribution to the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot. The Party and the people thank them. At the same time, their sacrifice has awakened the consciousness of millions of people, making them see through the brutal and despicable face of the counter-revolutionary rioters. Our People's Liberation Army is a brave and battle-hardened force that has defeated many powerful enemies. Why did we suffer such heavy losses in this suppression of the riot? It is because they, in order to protect the masses to the greatest extent, executed the discipline of the People's Liberation Army, 'not striking back when struck, not retaliating when insulted,' and exercised restraint. For nearly two months, our Party and government have adopted a policy of restraint and forbearance towards the turmoil. This is unprecedented in the world. Our People's Liberation Army only took self-defense measures when it was unavoidable. If we had not done so, our losses would have been even greater."

Li Peng said, "The three martyrs showed great bravery in suppressing the riot and sacrificed themselves heroically. This is the result of the Party's long-term education and training, and also due to the training of the People's Liberation Army. At the same time, I would like to thank you, as parents and brothers, for your education and upbringing at home."

Li Peng said, "Now the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital has been basically suppressed, and the situation is developing towards stability. However, many rioters have not yet been apprehended. We must suppress this riot to the end and will not let the criminals off. At the same time, we must implement the policies seriously and strictly distinguish between the two different types of contradictions."

Li Peng hoped that the families of the martyrs would bear their grief with fortitude, turn their sorrow into strength, and make contributions to the Four Modernizations at their respective posts.

The families of the three martyrs all said that their relatives died in defense of the Party Central Committee, the capital, and the People's Republic of China, and died gloriously. They expressed their gratitude for the concern of the Party and the government and requested that Premier Li Peng convey their greetings to Comrade Deng Xiaoping.

Those who participated in the meeting today included: Tian Jiyun, Song Ping, Qin Jiuwei, Wen Jiabao, Hong Xuezhi, Liu Huaqing, Luo Gan, Cui Naifu, Zhou Yibing, Liu Zhenhua, Zhu Dunfa, Zhang Xiufu, and leaders from local governments.

At the end of the meeting, leaders Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Yao Yilin, and others took a group photo with the families of the martyrs.

　　李鹏乔石姚依林会见烈士亲属

    李鹏说，要把平息暴乱进行到底，决不放过坏人。同时要认真执行政策，严格区分两类不同性质矛盾
    新华社北京６月１９日电　党和国家领导人李鹏、乔石、姚依林，今天下午在中南海紫光阁亲切会见在平息首都反革命暴乱中牺牲的刘国庚、崔国政、李国瑞三位烈士的亲属。
    中共中央政治局常委、国务院总理李鹏代表党中央、国务院向三位烈士的亲属以及为平息反革命暴乱而牺牲的其他烈士的亲属表示亲切慰问。
    下午４时３０分，当烈士亲属来到紫光阁的时候，李鹏、乔石、姚依林同他们一一握手，并把参加会见的其他党政军领导同志向他们作介绍。
    李鹏说，三位烈士壮烈牺牲，我们感到十分悲痛。我借此机会，向所有在平息首都反革命暴乱中牺牲的解放军、武警部队官兵和公安干警，表示沉痛的悼念，向所有烈士的亲属表示亲切慰问。
    李鹏说，烈士的牺牲，首先是为人民立下了功劳，为平息反革命暴乱立下了功劳，党和人民感谢他们。同时，他们的牺牲，唤起了千千万万人的觉悟，使人们识破了反革命暴徒残暴、可恶的面目。我们的人民解放军是一支英勇善战的部队，曾经击败许多强大的敌人，在这次平息暴乱中为什么会有这样大的损失？就是因为他们为了最大限度地保护群众，执行了解放军的纪律，“打不还手，骂不还口”，克制忍让。在将近两个月的时间里，我们的党和政府对动乱一直采取了克制忍让的态度。这在世界上是没有的。我们的解放军只是在迫不得已的情况下才进行了自卫。如果不这样，我们的损失会更大。李鹏说，三位烈士在平息暴乱中表现得十分英勇，牺牲得十分壮烈，这是党长期教育培养的结果，也由于解放军对他们的培养。同时，我要感谢你们作为父母兄长在家庭里对他们的培养教育。
    李鹏说，现在首都的反革命暴乱基本平息，局势向稳定的方向发展。但是，还有很多暴徒没有缉拿归案。我们一定要把平息这场暴乱进行到底，决不放过坏人。同时，我们要认真执行政策，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。
    李鹏希望烈士亲属节哀、保重，化悲痛为力量，在各自的岗位上为四化建设做出贡献。
    三位烈士亲属都表示，自己的亲人为保卫党中央，保卫首都，保卫人民共和国而死，死得光荣。他们表示感谢党和政府的关怀，并请李鹏总理转达对邓小平同志的问候。
    参加今天会见的还有：田纪云、宋平、秦基伟、温家宝、洪学智、刘华清、罗干、崔乃夫、周衣冰、刘振华、朱敦法、张秀夫以及地方政府的领导同志。
    会见结束时，李鹏、乔石、姚依林等领导同志与烈士亲属合影留念。
