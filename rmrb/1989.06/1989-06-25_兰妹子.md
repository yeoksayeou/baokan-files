Following the shepherd's song, windingly narrating,
Following the mountain bird's whistle, finely narrating,
Orchid Sister, this is a narrow path,
This is a path leading to spring.
You are a horse trapped in the city,
Orchid Sister, a young and pure white horse.
From the glass doors of high-rise buildings,
From the bustling crowds on the wide streets,
Clop-clop, you run back to your hometown.
Orchid Sister, this is the grassy slope nearest to you,
This is the quiet poplar forest at noon.
You lie diagonally in the sunlight,
You close your eyes beautifully.
Floating in the buzzing dance of the wild bees and the cudweed,
Listening to their murmuring dreams.
The shadow of poetry quietly stands in the water,
Becoming transparent, section by section,
Walking out from the thick walls.
Orchid Sister, with your black hair,
Wearing simple shoes,
You casually step into the Chinese morning,
From one place to another.
This is a narrow dirt road,
This is a path leading to spring.
You will know that is the place
Where the smoke rises faintly.
Orchid Sister,
Your red dress is fluttering in the wind,
Fluttering in the oat fields and wild sunflowers,
Fluttering in the sparkling river water at dusk.
This is a path never retrodden,
This is a path narrated by music.

　　兰妹子
    蓝蓝
    沿着放羊人的歌声弯弯地叙述
    沿着山雀子的哨声细细地叙述
    兰妹子，这是一条窄窄的路
    这是一条走向春天的路
    你是一匹困在城市里的马
    兰妹子，一匹年轻又洁白的马
    从高厦的玻璃门旁
    从宽街熙熙攘攘的人群中
    哒哒奔回故乡
    兰妹子，这是离你最近的草坡
    这是中午宁静的槐树林
    你就这样斜斜地躺在阳光里
    你就这样好看地闭上眼睛
    浮起在芨芨草和小野蜂
    　嗡嗡的飞舞里
    听她们呢哝着梦话
    诗的影子悄悄立在水中
    一节节变得透明
    从厚厚的围墙里走出
    兰妹子，你披着黑发
    穿着朴素的鞋子
    随便地跨进中国的早晨
    从一个地方走向另一个地方
    这是一条窄窄的土路
    这是一条走向春天的路
    你会知道那是炊烟
    　淡淡升起的地方
    兰妹子
    你的红衣裳在风里飘着
    在燕麦地和野葵中飘着
    在黄昏闪闪发亮的河水里飘着
    这是一条不曾被足迹重复的路
    这是一条被音乐叙述的路
