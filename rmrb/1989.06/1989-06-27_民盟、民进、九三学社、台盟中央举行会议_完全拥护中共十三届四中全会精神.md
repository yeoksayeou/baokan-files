The Central Committees of the China Democratic League, China Democratic Promotion Association, the Third of September Society, and the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held meetings today to fully support the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 27th, the China Democratic League held an expanded meeting of the Chairman's Conference in Beijing today, expressing resolute support for the various decisions in the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

Attendees at the meeting believed that Deng Xiaoping's important speech is a guiding document for stopping the turmoil, suppressing the rebellion, and guiding China's reform and construction. The communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China emphasizes the need to continue to resolutely implement the basic line of "one center, two basic points" determined by the 13th Party Congress, which is of great significance for stabilizing public sentiment, developing the economy, and enhancing social cohesion. It must be persistently implemented. The four cardinal principles are the foundation of the state, and reform and opening up are the path to national strength. The two are indispensable. Attendees at the meeting reviewed the remarkable achievements of China's reform and opening up over the past decade and believed that reform and opening up are in line with the fundamental interests of the people of the entire country and the trend of the world. It is necessary to steadfastly follow the path of deepening reform and opening up, as closing the door to the world is a dead end.

The meeting called on the China Democratic League at all levels to carry out education on patriotism, socialism, independence, and self-reliance, and to resolutely oppose bourgeois liberalization, continuously strengthen self-construction; to give full play to its advantages in vigorously promoting democratic and legal construction and resolutely combating corruption, and to make due contributions to the country's stability and social development.

Attendees at the meeting proposed that we should, as always, unite around the Communist Party of China, further enrich and develop the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party, work together, strive hard, and make efforts to continue to advance the great cause of China's socialist modernization construction and reform and opening up.

The meeting was presided over by Fei Xiaotong, Chairman of the China Democratic League Central Committee, and attended by Vice Chairmen Gao Tian, Ye Duyi, Tao Dazong, Luo Hanxian, Feng Zhiyun, and Vice Chairmen of the China Democratic League Central Committee Consultative Committee Wen Jiabao and Li Wenyi.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 27th, Chairman of the China Democratic Promotion Association, Lei Jieqiong, presided over a Chairman's Conference this morning to study and discuss the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. The meeting fully supports the various resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; supports Jiang Zemin as the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the adjustment of some leading organs of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China; supports the Fourth Plenary Session's analysis and decision on the national political situation; and supports the continued resolute implementation of the basic line of "one center, two basic points" determined by the 13th Party Congress.

The meeting believed that adhering to the four cardinal principles has special guiding significance for the China Democratic Promotion Association, which mainly consists of members from the fields of education, culture, and publishing. Adhering to the four cardinal principles is the foundation of the state. We must strengthen ideological and political work among members and contribute to the construction of socialist spiritual civilization.

The meeting decided to issue an "Urgent Notice on Studying and Implementing the Spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China" to the entire association, calling on the China Democratic Promotion Association's local organizations and all members to study the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session and Deng Xiaoping's important speech, and to work together with the Communist Party of China to strengthen and develop the patriotic united front, and to make new contributions to the cause of socialist modernization construction.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 27th, the Central Committee of the Third of September Society held a meeting in Beijing today with central and standing committee members to study and discuss the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, unanimously expressing support for the various decisions made by the plenary session.

The meeting unanimously believed that Zhao Ziyang's errors in the anti-party and anti-socialist turmoil are extremely serious. The plenary session's handling of his errors is completely correct, and it is resolutely supported.

The meeting unanimously supports Jiang Zemin as the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, supports the necessary adjustments made by the plenary session to some members of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China's leading organs, and expresses sincere support and full trust in the new central leadership.

The meeting highly praised the plenary session's decision to continue to resolutely implement the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee and the basic line of "one center, two basic points" determined by the 13th Party Congress, and fully agrees with the four major tasks identified by the plenary session as needing special attention at present. The meeting believed that these decisions are in line with the public sentiment and will definitely receive the resolute support of the people of the entire country.

The meeting emphasized that the Third of September Society has always stood with the Communist Party of China through thick and thin. In the future, the Third of September Society will, as always, resolutely support and maintain the political leadership of the Communist Party of China, adhere to the four cardinal principles, adhere to reform and opening up, adhere to the multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and strive for the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 27th, the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Central Committee held an expanded meeting of the Chairman's Conference today to convey and study the relevant documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. Attendees at the meeting unanimously expressed their support for the various decisions made by the plenary session.

The meeting was presided over by Cai Zidong, Chairman of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Central Committee, and attended by central committee members, alternate central committee members, central committee members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and heads of various departments of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Central Committee who are in Beijing.

The meeting believed that the four adherences and reform and opening up are the foundation of the state and the path to national strength, respectively. The two complement each other and are indispensable. The resolution of the Fourth Plenary Session has further strengthened the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang's confidence in the Communist Party of China and strengthened the confidence in China's further stable, better, and faster steps in reform and opening up along the socialist path.

The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Central Committee called on all members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang to study the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, to unite more closely around the Communist Party of China, to work together, and to make efforts for the successful completion of the four major tasks identified by the plenary session as needing special attention at present, and for the more comprehensive implementation of the basic line of "one center, two basic points."

The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang Central Committee also hopes that compatriots in Taiwan and overseas will closely follow the new situation in mainland China after the Fourth Plenary Session, eliminate various doubts, work together to promote exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, and make due contributions to the prosperity and strength and peaceful reunification of the motherland.
