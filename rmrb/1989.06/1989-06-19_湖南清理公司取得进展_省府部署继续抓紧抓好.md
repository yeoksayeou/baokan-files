Hunan Makes Progress in Company Cleanup and Rectification
Provincial Government Deploys Further Efforts to Ensure Completion

BEIJING, June 19 (Xinhua) -- The Hunan Provincial Government has deployed further efforts to ensure the completion of the company cleanup and rectification work.

In the previous period, Hunan Province listed a total of 5,522 new and old companies for cleanup and rectification. By the end of April this year, 5,318 of these companies had basically completed their cleanup and rectification tasks, accounting for 96.3% of the total. The province has identified 917 companies with various violations and illegal activities. Of these, 585 cases have been filed by relevant departments, with 481 cases already punished or otherwise handled, accounting for 82.2% of the cases under investigation. The total amount of fines and confiscations is 18.87 million yuan.

Based on the criticisms and suggestions from the representatives of the Seventh Session of the Second People's Congress of Hunan Province held in early to mid-May, and the actual situation in Hunan, the Hunan Provincial Government has made the following deployments to further ensure the completion of the company cleanup and rectification work:

1. In accordance with the scope specified in the "Decision on Cleanup and Rectification of Companies" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, a thorough review of the previous company cleanup and rectification work will be conducted.
2. Strictly enforce the regulations of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on prohibiting party and government agencies and their personnel from engaging in business and managing enterprises. For companies that have been approved to remain, it is necessary to completely sever ties with party and government agencies in terms of personnel, finances, and assets.
3. Mobilize the enthusiasm of both supervisory and executive departments to concentrate efforts and accelerate the pace of handling illegal cases involving some companies.
4. Organize forces to speed up the cleanup and rectification work in some key departments. The focus of the cleanup and rectification is on the circulation sector, especially the foreign economic and trade system.
5. Seriously handle the aftermath of the merger and dissolution of companies.

　　湖南清理公司取得进展
    省府部署继续抓紧抓好
    本报长沙６月１９日电  记者吴兴华报道：湖南省人民政府部署进一步抓好清理整顿公司工作。
    前一段时间，湖南省列入清理整顿范围的新老公司共５５２２家，到今年４月底止，基本完成清理整顿任务的共５３１８家，占应清理整顿数的９６．３％。全省查出有各种违章、违法行为的公司９１７家，已由有关部门立案查处的５８５家，其中已作出经济处罚或其他处理的４８１家，占查处数的８２．２％，罚没款总额１８８７万元。
    根据在５月上、中旬召开的省七届人大二次会上省人大代表的批评建议和湖南省的实际，湖南省政府就进一步抓好清理整顿公司工作作出部署，其中主要有：一、按照中共中央、国务院《关于清理整顿公司的决定》规定的范围，对前段清理整顿公司工作进行一次认真的复查；二、坚决执行党中央、国务院关于严禁党政机关和党政机关干部经商办企业的规定，对于批准保留的公司，必须在人、财、物等方面与党政机关彻底脱钩；三、发挥主管部门和执行部门两方面的积极性，集中力量，加快速度，对一些公司的违法案件及时作出处理；四、组织力量，抓紧对一些重点部门的清理整顿工作。清理整顿的重点是流通领域，尤其是外经外贸系统；五、认真做好撤并公司的善后处理工作。
