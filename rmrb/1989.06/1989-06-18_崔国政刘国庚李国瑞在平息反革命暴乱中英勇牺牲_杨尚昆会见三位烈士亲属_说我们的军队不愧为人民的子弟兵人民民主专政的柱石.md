Cui Guozheng, Liu Guogeng, and Li Guorui Martyr in Suppressing Counter-Revolutionary Rebellion

Yang Shangkun Meets with the Families of Three Martyrs

Says Our Army Truly Deserves to Be Called the People's Army and the Pillars of People's Democratic Dictatorship

Cui Guozheng, Liu Guogeng, and Li Guorui, who bravely sacrificed their lives in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital, were honored by Yang Shangkun, Chairman of the State and Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission, who met with their families today. Yang Shangkun said that the three comrades gave their lives to defend the Party Central Committee, the capital, and the People's Republic, which is an honor for their families and the entire military.

Yang Shangkun, on behalf of the Central Military Commission and Chairman Deng Xiaoping, expressed heartfelt greetings to the families of the three martyrs and offered deep condolences for their sacrifices.

At 4 PM, six family members of the three martyrs arrived at the meeting room of the Central Military Commission. Yang Shangkun shook hands with each of them and introduced the military leaders present, including Hong Xuezhi, Liu Huaqing, Qin Jiwei, Chi Haotian, Yang Baibing, and Zhao Nanqi.

Yang Shangkun then spoke, saying, "We, on behalf of the Military Commission and Chairman Deng Xiaoping, thank the families of the three martyrs for raising such excellent soldiers and sons for the country and the people. The three families have produced three heroes, which is an honor for the three families, the People's Liberation Army, and the nation. The names of the three martyrs all contain the character 'country,' indicating that they are truly patriotic new people."

Yang Shangkun said, "To suppress such a counter-revolutionary rebellion, sacrifices are inevitable. The sacrifices are significant, and for your three families, they are even more so. Why did our soldiers get beaten, and why did your loved ones suffer such a tragic fate? It is because the soldiers feared harming the citizens and students. The three martyrs, along with other fallen comrades, truly came to defend the people and maintain the social order of the capital. They sacrificed themselves while strictly adhering to the principle of loving the people. They died bravely, demonstrating that our army truly deserves to be called the people's army and the pillars of people's democratic dictatorship. In recent days, the mourning activities on the streets of Beijing for the fallen martyrs have been very moving. These activities were entirely spontaneous, showing that the broad masses of the people firmly support the decision of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion. It also shows that the people will never forget these steadfast soldiers who sacrificed themselves for the people's interests."

Yang Shangkun, while briefing the families of the martyrs on the situation in Beijing regarding the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, said that for a period, Beijing was in chaos. If decisive measures had not been taken, the consequences would have been unthinkable. He encouraged the families of the martyrs, saying, "Always remember, the Communist Party cannot be overthrown, and the People's Republic cannot be overthrown. I am confident that with the support of the broad masses of the people and party members, and with the defense of the People's Liberation Army, the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China will never be overthrown." Yang Shangkun also inquired about the living, working, and health conditions of the families of the three martyrs, encouraging them to turn their grief into strength, to mourn and take care of themselves.

Cui Guozheng's mother, Wen Guilian, holding Yang Shangkun's hand, said, "Suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital and defending the people's country is a wise decision by the Party. On behalf of my family, I express my gratitude to the Party Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and Chairman Deng." She asked Yang Shangkun to convey her greetings to Deng Xiaoping and wished him good health.

Liu Guogeng's father, Liu Zhirong, is an old soldier who fought to establish New China and a second-class disabled veteran. He told Yang Shangkun and other leaders of the Central Military Commission, "My son died for the country and the people, dying a worthy and glorious death. I feel proud." Li Guorui's elder brother, Li Guocheng, on behalf of his ailing mother, greeted Chairman Deng Xiaoping and Vice Chairman Yang Shangkun, and expressed the hope that his younger brother, Li Guotong, would inherit Li Guorui's will, enlist in the army, and continue to fight for the defense of the Party and the people's interests.

Also present at the meeting with the families of the three martyrs were leaders from the units where the martyrs served and from their hometown governments. At the end of the meeting, Yang Shangkun and other military leaders posed for a group photo with the families of the martyrs.

　　崔国政刘国庚李国瑞在平息反革命暴乱中英勇牺牲
    杨尚昆会见三位烈士亲属
    说我们的军队不愧为人民的子弟兵人民民主专政的柱石
    新华社北京６月１８日电  国家主席、中央军委副主席杨尚昆，今天下午在会见平息首都反革命暴乱中英勇牺牲的崔国政、刘国庚、李国瑞三位烈士的亲属时说，三位同志为保卫党中央、保卫首都，保卫人民共和国而献身，这是你们三个家庭的光荣，也是我们全军的光荣。
    杨尚昆代表中央军委、代表邓小平主席向三位烈士的亲属表示亲切慰问，对三位烈士的牺牲表示沉痛哀悼。
    下午４时，三位烈士的六位亲属来到中央军委的会议室里，杨尚昆和他们一一握手，并向他们介绍了参加会见的洪学智、刘华清、秦基伟、迟浩田、杨白冰、赵南起等军委领导同志。
    杨尚昆接着讲话。他说，我们代表军委和邓小平主席感谢你们三位烈士的亲属，感谢你们为国家、为人民培养了这样的好战士、好儿子。你们三家出了三个英雄，是你们三家的光荣，是解放军的光荣，是国家的光荣。三位烈士的名字都有一个“国”字，他们都是爱国新人。
    杨尚昆说：平息这样一场反革命暴乱，免不了要付出一些代价，应该说付出的代价不小，对你们三家来说更不小。我们的战士为什么挨打，你们的亲人为什么惨遭杀害，是因为指战员们怕伤害市民和青年学生。三位牺牲的同志，还有其他的烈士，真正是为保卫人民、维护首都的社会秩序而来的。他们都是在严格执行热爱人民这个宗旨下牺牲的。他们牺牲得很英勇，这表明我们的军队不愧为人民的子弟兵，不愧为人民民主专政的柱石。近几天，北京街头对死难烈士的悼念活动非常感人。这些活动完全是自发的，这说明广大人民群众对党中央、国务院、中央军委关于平息反革命暴乱的决策是坚决拥护的，也说明人民群众是不会忘记这些为人民利益而牺牲的坚强战士的。
    杨尚昆副主席在向烈士亲属介绍北京平息反革命暴乱的情况时说，一段时期，北京乱得不得了，如果不采取果断措施，后果将不堪设想。他勉励烈士亲属说，要永远记住，共产党不能推翻，人民共和国不能推翻。他说，我深信，有广大人民、广大党员的支持，有解放军的捍卫，我们中国共产党和中华人民共和国是绝不会被推翻的。杨尚昆还一一询问了三位烈士亲属生活、工作和身体情况，勉励他们化悲痛为力量，节哀、保重。
    崔国政烈士的母亲温桂琴握着杨尚昆副主席的手说，平息首都的反革命暴乱，保住了人民的江山，这是党的英明决策。我代表全家向党中央、国务院、中央军委，向邓主席表示感谢。她请杨尚昆副主席向邓小平主席问好，希望他保重身体。
    刘国庚烈士的父亲刘志荣，是一位为建立新中国而战斗过的老战士、二等甲级残废军人。他向杨尚昆等中央军委领导同志说，我儿子为国为民而死，死得其所，死得光荣，我感到自豪。李国瑞的二哥李国成代表他生病的母亲向邓小平主席、杨尚昆副主席问好，并表示希望让他的小弟李国忠继承李国瑞的遗志，参军入伍，为捍卫党和人民的利益继续战斗。
    参加会见三位烈士亲属的，还有烈士生前所在部队和家乡政府的领导同志。会见结束时，杨尚昆等军委领导同志同烈士亲属合影留念。
