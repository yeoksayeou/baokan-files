The construction of the Sea River embankment slope protection project, which ensures flood safety, is proceeding at a fast pace with the active support of suburban farmers. The Sea River is a key flood control waterway that poses a threat to the city during the flood season. Tianjin has decided to accelerate the construction of permanent flood control projects, using stone to protect the river embankments. In the construction process, only the eastern suburbs will temporarily occupy 66 mu of farmland and permanently occupy 17.3 mu of land, causing farmers a loss of tens of millions of yuan. The farmers in the area understand the bigger picture and consider the overall situation, do not demand compensation, and ensure that the project is completed ahead of schedule.
