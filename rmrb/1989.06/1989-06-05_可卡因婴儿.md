A hospital in Rockford, Illinois, reported that a female infant born in February died two days after birth due to severe oxygen deprivation. Doctors found traces of cocaine toxins in the infant's urine and also detected the same substance in the blood of the infant's mother, Melanie Green. Upon receiving the hospital's report, local judicial authorities arrested the 24-year-old Melanie on charges of indirect homicide and providing drugs to a minor.

Cases of pregnant women damaging their fetuses by consuming or injecting cocaine and other drugs are becoming increasingly common in the United States. Experts estimate that approximately 375,000 newborns or fetuses die each year due to drug poisoning. Doctors say these "cocaine babies" suffer nerve damage and, if not dying in the womb, are born weak, deformed, and often die soon after birth.

The judicial authorities' decision to arrest Melanie Green was based on a criminal perspective, as the infant died two days after birth, leading to an investigation that identified the mother as the cause of death.

However, advocates for women's rights oppose the judicial authorities' strict measures. They argue that pregnant women smoking or drinking alcohol also harm their fetuses, and it would be difficult to draw clear legal boundaries between what is criminal and what is not. A female prosecutor acknowledged the complexity of the issue, stating, "Some women have to stand all day at work, and this also harms the fetus during pregnancy. Should we arrest them too?"

Public opinion polls indicate that a significant number of people believe that pregnant women should be legally responsible for their future children's well-being, including issues related to smoking and drinking. However, as of now, no state in the United States has enacted clear legal provisions on this matter.

　　可卡因婴儿
    美国伊利诺州洛克福德市一家医院今年二月有一个女婴出生两天后因严重缺氧死去。医生在女婴的尿液里查出含有可卡因毒素，同时也在女婴生母梅兰尼·格林的血液中查出同样的毒物踪迹。当地司法机关得到医院的报告后，即以间接杀人罪和向幼儿提供毒品罪将二十四岁的梅兰尼逮捕。
    因孕妇吸食或注射可卡因等毒品而损害了腹中胎儿的事例在美国越来越多。据专家估计，全国每年约有三十七万五千新生婴儿或胎儿因中毒死亡。医生们说这些“可卡因婴儿”的神经都受到损伤，如果不是死于母腹内，出生后也必然弱小、畸形并很快死去。
    关于梅兰尼·格林的被捕，司法当局是从刑事犯罪角度判断并作出决定的，因为一个婴儿降生两天后便突然死亡，追查死因，发现凶手是婴儿的母亲。
    但是保障妇女权利团体的人士反对司法当局的硬性做法。他们认为孕妇吸烟或饮酒同样对胎儿造成伤害，如果制定法律，罪与非罪的界限很难划分。一位女检察官承认这是一个难题。她说：“有些妇女要整天站着工作，她们怀孕期间也对胎儿造成伤害，难道也要逮捕她们吗？”
    民意测验表明相当多的人认为孕妇的行为在法律上应对她们的未来子女负责，包括吸烟和饮酒。然而美国至今还没有任何州制定出明确的法律条文。
