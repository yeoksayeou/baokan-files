Martial Law Command Headquarters Studies Deng Xiaoping's Important Speech
Determined to Achieve Complete Victory in Suppressing the Counterrevolutionary Rebellion

Newspaper of the People's Liberation Army, June 10, Beijing: The Martial Law Command Headquarters has carefully studied the important speech given by Deng Xiaoping, Chairman of the Central Military Commission, during his reception of military officers at the rank of major general and above. They are determined to press on and achieve complete victory in suppressing the counterrevolutionary rebellion.

Everyone discussed that Deng Xiaoping's speech was far-sighted and profoundly insightful in analyzing the causes and nature of this counterrevolutionary rebellion. He highly evaluated the Martial Law Command's completion of its mission and pointed out the direction for the future development of the military and the country's reform and construction. This has extremely important and far-reaching significance for the entire Party, the military, and the people of the nation to unite and strive for the complete victory in suppressing the counterrevolutionary rebellion.

Everyone mentioned that the occurrence of this counterrevolutionary rebellion was not accidental. It was a political backlash resulting from the combination of international trends and current ideologies in China. It was inevitable and not subject to human will. At this critical moment concerning the life and death of the Party and the state, Deng Xiaoping, with his keen insight and great courage, timely and accurately pointed out the nature of this struggle. The Party Central Committee made a decisive decision to resolutely oppose the turmoil and suppress the counterrevolutionary rebellion, saving the Party, saving the state, and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the people nationwide. The practice over the past month fully proves that Deng Xiaoping's judgment on the nature of this struggle is completely correct. Deng Xiaoping is not only the supreme commander of the entire military but also the chief architect of our country's construction and reform. Following the direction indicated by the Party Central Committee, the military has hope, the Party has hope, and our country's construction and reform have hope.

Everyone also mentioned that Deng Xiaoping, with deep feelings, highly evaluated the Martial Law Command's suppression of the counterrevolutionary rebellion, which is a great encouragement and motivation for the Martial Law Command and all military personnel. In the past few days, the Martial Law Command has already submitted a qualified report to the Party and the people through its actual actions, demonstrating that our military is indeed a people's army under the leadership of the Party, indeed the children of the people, and indeed the strong pillar of defending people's democratic dictatorship. At the same time, everyone deeply feels the heavy responsibility and unanimously expressed the determination to summarize experiences and lessons, to start and finish well, and to achieve complete victory with one breath. Everyone said that we firmly believe that the vast majority of the people support the Party, follow the socialist path, and love the children of the people. The rioters and traitors are a very small number. The practice over the past few days has fully proven this. With the support of the people, we will definitely write a better report.

Everyone believes that the current suppression of the rebellion has achieved significant victories, but the next step's task is still arduous. Deng Xiaoping's speech is both a commendation and a mobilization order for the Martial Law Command. Everyone expressed that they will definitely resolutely implement the martial law order issued by the State Council, fully play the roles of the security team, propaganda team, and service team, and closely cooperate with the armed police, public security officers, and the vast majority of the people to continue to steadily, accurately, and firmly strike a small number of counterrevolutionary rioters. Actively do the work of propaganda among the people, strive to do good things and practical things for the people of Beijing, unite with the vast majority of the people of Beijing, achieve complete victory in suppressing the counterrevolutionary rebellion and restoring the normal order of the capital, and strive to make greater contributions to the Party and the people, making the people of the nation happy and the Party Central Committee at ease.

    决心夺取平息反革命暴乱的彻底胜利
    新华社北京６月１０日电  戒严部队指挥部新闻处消息：戒严部队指挥部认真学习中央军委主席邓小平在接见戒严部队军以上干部时的重要讲话，决心再接再厉，夺取平息反革命暴乱的彻底胜利。
    大家在讨论中说，邓小平同志高瞻远瞩，深刻精辟地分析了这场反革命暴乱发生的原因和实质，对戒严部队完成任务给予了高度评价，对今后军队建设和国家的改革、建设指明了方向，这对于全党全军和全国人民统一思想，团结奋斗，夺取平息反革命暴乱的彻底胜利，具有极其重大的深远的意义。
    大家谈到，这场反革命暴乱的发生不是偶然的，这是国际大气候与中国当前存在的思潮相结合的一种政治逆流，迟早总是要发生的，是不以人们的意志为转移的。邓小平同志在这个关系到党和国家生死存亡的历史关头，以敏锐的洞察力和伟大气魄，及时准确地指明了这场斗争的性质。党中央果断地作出了坚决反对动乱、平息反革命暴乱的英明决策，挽救了党，挽救了国家，维护了全国人民的根本利益。一个多月的实践充分证明，邓小平同志对这场斗争性质的判断是完全正确的。邓小平同志不仅是全军的最高统帅，而且是我们国家建设和改革的总设计师。沿着党中央指引的方向前进，军队有希望，党有希望，我国的建设和改革有希望。
    大家还谈到，邓小平同志以深厚的感情对戒严部队平息反革命暴乱给予了高度评价，这对戒严部队和全军指战员是极大的教育、鼓励和鞭策。在过去的几天中，戒严部队以自己的实际行动已经向党和人民交了一份合格的答卷，表明我们这支军队不愧是党领导下的人民军队，不愧为人民子弟兵，不愧为保卫人民民主专政的坚强柱石。同时大家深感责任重大，一致表示要认真总结经验教训，要善始善终，一鼓作气地夺取全胜。大家说，我们坚信，广大的人民群众是拥护党、走社会主义道路、热爱人民子弟兵的。暴乱分子、民族败类是极少数的。这几天的实践已充分证明了这一点。在人民群众的支持下，我们一定能把这份答卷写得更好。
    大家认为，当前平息暴乱已经取得了重大胜利，但下一步的任务仍很艰巨。邓小平同志的讲话，既是对戒严部队的嘉奖令，又是动员令。大家表示，一定坚决执行国务院戒严令，充分发挥保卫队、宣传队、服务队的作用，与武警、公安干警和广大人民群众密切配合，继续稳、准、狠地打击一小撮反革命暴乱分子，积极做好宣传群众的工作，努力为首都人民群众办好事、办实事，同首都广大人民群众团结在一起，夺取平息反革命暴乱、恢复首都正常秩序的彻底胜利，努力为党和人民作出更大的贡献，让全国人民高兴，让党中央放心。
