The Buddha said: I walk barefoot, so that I may leave footprints.
The fox said: I keep shaking my tail, so that I may erase my footprints.
Before dawn, the sparrows chirp excitedly, claiming they are off to distant skies to achieve great deeds, and they are so excited they can hardly sit still.
At dusk, they all return to the same tree to roost for the night.
Loving beauty but being lazy, thus there are artificial flowers.
The tiger is very wronged: "I have repeatedly declared that I do not harm small animals, but they just won't listen."
He hates the color green. Because once, a bird perched on a branch and defecated, and it happened to land on his head.
The eagle flies so high;
The crab says: "Hmph, can it walk sideways?!"
The rain is still falling.
The tree says: "Let it rain a bit more."
The haystack says: "It can't rain any more."
The stone says: "It's all the same to me."
The rain doesn't know whom to listen to.

　　随感录
    佛说：我赤着脚，就是为了留下脚印。
    狐狸说：我不断甩动尾巴，就是为了抹去脚印。
    黎明前，麻雀叽叽喳喳，表示要到遥远的天际去干一番大事业，激动得坐立不安。
    黄昏，它们又一个不少地飞回夜宿的大树。
    又爱美，又懒，于是便有了假花。
    老虎委屈极了：“我一再发表声明，说我不伤害小动物，可它们就是不听。”
    他讨厌绿色。因为曾经有一只鸟，站在树枝上拉屎，恰好掉在他头上。
    老鹰飞得好高哟；
    螃蟹说：哼，它会横行吗？！
    雨还在下。
    树说：再下点吧。
    草堆说：不能再下了。
    石头说：随便。
    雨不知该听谁的。
