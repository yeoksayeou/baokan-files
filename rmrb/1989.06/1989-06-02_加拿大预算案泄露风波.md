For over a month, senior officials of the Canadian federal government have been plagued by the issue of the premature leak of this year's budget, and there have been persistent rumors that Wilson, widely regarded as the most capable finance minister since the war, may have to step down.

The sequence of events is straightforward. April 27 was the date set by the Mulroney-led new government to announce its first budget. However, on the evening of April 26, at 6:55 PM, the Canadian Global Television Network broadcast the main contents of the budget. Government officials were thrown into disarray, forcing Finance Minister Wilson to hastily hold a press conference at 10 PM that evening to announce the budget to the media.

An intense debate immediately ensued in the House of Commons, with the opposition accusing the government of negligence and demanding that Finance Minister Wilson resign. Prime Minister Mulroney, however, rejected this demand, stating that someone had stolen important government documents.

Generally speaking, since the government's budget outlines the economic policies and many specific measures for the coming year, it is of great significance to the financial markets, various industrial sectors, and companies. Knowing the contents in advance could be highly beneficial to some individuals. However, this time, no significant consequences were apparent.

The chief reporter of the Canadian Global Television Network's Ottawa bureau, Smol, obtained this important document with ease. It is said that on the afternoon of April 26, someone called him, and he then went to a gas station where an unknown person handed him a brief version of the budget. The television station then officially released it, believing it was the natural duty of a journalist to do so.

The Royal Canadian Mounted Police conducted a tense investigation into the leak for nearly a month and officially released the investigation results on the night of May 29, charging five individuals, including Smol. The media, opposition figures, and many legal experts believe that charging a journalist is a violation of the Canadian Constitution and an infringement on press freedom. Some estimate that if the case goes to court, it will be a fierce and protracted legal battle. The budget leak controversy is far from over.

　　加拿大预算案泄露风波
    本报渥太华６月１日电  记者郭文福报道：近一个多月来，加拿大联邦政府的主要官员因为今年财政预算案提前泄露的问题已被困扰得疲惫不堪，被认为是战后最能干的一位财政部长威尔逊可能为此下台的传闻不断出现。
    事情的经过很简单，４月２７日是以马尔罗尼为首的新政府公布第一个预算案的日期，但就在正式公布的前一天，即４月２６日的晚上６时５５分，加拿大环球电视台把预算案的主要内容公开广播了。一时间，政府官员手脚大乱，逼迫财政部长威尔逊不得不于当晚１０时仓促举行记者招待会，向新闻界公布预算内容。
    随即一场激烈的辩论便在众议院展开，反对党指责政府失职，要求财政部长威尔逊引咎辞职，马尔罗尼总理则拒绝这一要求，声称是有人窃取了政府的重要文件。
    一般说来，由于政府的财政预算案详细规定了未来一年中政府的经济大政方针和许多具体措施，它对金融市场、各工业和企业界部门和公司来说都是相当重要的。而事先获悉某些内容，可能对某些人极有好处。但这一次却没有造成什么明显的后果。
    加拿大环球电视台驻渥太华记者站的首席记者斯莫尔这一次是轻而易举的得到了这份重要文件的。据说是４月２６日下午有人给他打了个电话，他随即前去一个加油站，一个他不认识的人把印成简要本的预算案给了他。然后他们的电视台就正式予以公布，他们认为这是作为一个新闻记者理所当然应作的事情。
    加拿大皇家骑警对这一泄密案进行近一个月紧张的调查，５月２９日夜正式公布了调查结果，对包括斯莫尔在内的５个人提出指控。新闻界、反对党人士以及许多法律专家则认为，这样指控一名记者是违犯加拿大宪法，是干涉新闻自由。有人估计，如果诉诸法庭，这场官司必是一场激烈的、短期内又难结束的法律纷争。这场预算案泄露风波一时难以平息。
