Commemorating "Anti-American Joint Struggle Month"
North Korean Ambassador Holds Press Conference

Our reporter Zhou Bixiong reports from Beijing: North Korean Ambassador to China, Chu Changjun, held a press conference today to welcome the "June 25th - July 27th Anti-American Joint Struggle Month." He strongly condemned the United States and the South Korean authorities for obstructing peace and peaceful reunification in Korea and plotting permanent division.

Chu Changjun said that the Korean War armistice has been in place for 36 years, but a solid peace has not been achieved on the Korean Peninsula. The Republic's government has made unremitting efforts to turn the temporary armistice into a solid peace and eliminate the danger of war. In recent years, it has proposed reasonable suggestions such as holding tripartite talks. However, the United States and the South Korean authorities have refused to accept them.

He pointed out that the United States should stop interfering in our internal affairs and immediately withdraw all its military equipment and personnel from South Korea. The South Korean authorities should readily accept our legitimate peace proposals.

　　纪念“反美共同斗争月”    
    朝驻华大使举行记者招待会
    本报北京６月２３日讯  记者周必忠报道：朝鲜驻华大使朱昌骏今天就迎接“６·２５—７·２７反美共同斗争月”举行记者招待会，强烈谴责美国和南朝鲜当局阻碍朝鲜的和平与和平统一，策划朝鲜的永久分裂。
    朱昌骏说，朝鲜停战已经３６年，然而在朝鲜半岛仍未能实现巩固的和平。共和国政府为使临时的停战状态变为巩固的和平，消除战争危险，作出了坚持不懈的努力。近年来，提出了关于举行三方会谈建议等合情合理的主张。但是美国和南朝鲜当局拒不接受。
    他指出，美国应该不再干涉我国内政，从南朝鲜立即撤出其一切军事装备和军事人员。南朝鲜当局理应欣然接受我们光明正大的和平主张。
