Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 15th.

15 vice-chairpersons of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, representing Chairman Wan Li and the NPC, visited the troops of the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the public security officers carrying out martial law tasks this morning at the East Gate Plaza of the Great Hall of the People. They also visited wounded soldiers at the 305 Hospital.

The 15 vice-chairpersons are: Hab Comin, Peng Chong, Zhu Lianfan, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, Saifuddin Azizi, Zhou Guocheng, Yan Jici, Rong Yiren, Liao Hansheng, Ni Zhifu, Chen Muhua, Fei Xiaotong, Sun Qimeng, Lei Jieqiong, and Wang Hanbin.

Hab Comin said in his speech, "Since the early hours of June 3rd, a small number of rioters in our capital, Beijing, incited some people who were unaware of the truth to create a horrifying and serious counter-revolutionary riot. At this critical moment, under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, you have decisively executed the central government's wise decisions, taken resolute measures, and quickly suppressed this counter-revolutionary riot. You have thus made great contributions to safeguarding the socialist system, the people's government, and the safety of the lives and property of the people of the capital. I, on behalf of Chairman Wan Li and all the staff of the NPC, extend our sincere greetings and express our highest respect to you! To those who were injured in the struggle to suppress the riot, we extend our heartfelt condolences. To the martyrs who sacrificed their lives, we express our deepest sorrow."

Hab Comin said, "In suppressing this counter-revolutionary riot, you have shown a high level of awareness and passed the test. In the face of danger to your lives, you have always put the interests of the people and the country first. For the sake of protecting the people of the capital and the achievements of construction and reform, you have displayed a revolutionary spirit of fearlessness in the face of hardship and danger, of not fearing bloodshed and sacrifice, and of pressing forward undaunted. You have overcome numerous difficulties and, in a very complex situation, achieved a great victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot. With your actual actions, you have fully demonstrated that you can shoulder the sacred mission of 'defending the motherland and safeguarding the peaceful labor of the people' as entrusted by the Constitution. You are truly the people's children, and the strong pillars of people's democratic dictatorship. Your great historical achievements will forever be remembered by the people of all ethnic groups in the country and will be recorded in the glorious annals of the People's Republic of China."

Hab Comin also said, "We must be soberly aware that the counter-revolutionary riot has not been completely suppressed. A small number of rioters are still resisting and plotting to make trouble. As the permanent body of the highest state power organ, the Standing Committee of the NPC, has the sacred responsibility to uphold the dignity of the Constitution and supervise its implementation. We firmly support your just actions to defend the dignity of the Constitution and the law. We hope that you will continue to strive, continue to display revolutionary heroism, and resolutely fight against the small number of people who created the riot until you achieve complete victory. This will ensure the smooth progress of the Four Cardinal Principles and the reform and opening up, and you will create new achievements."

The commander of the martial law troops said in his speech that they would not disappoint the expectations of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Standing Committee of the NPC. They would, with even more outstanding and exemplary actions, complete the martial law tasks successfully.

Those who participated in the visit also included vice-secretaries of the Standing Committee of the NPC and the heads of the seven special committees and the Legislative Affairs Commission of the NPC.
