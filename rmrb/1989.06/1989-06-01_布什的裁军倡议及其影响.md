At the end of May, at the NATO summit, President Bush proposed his first arms reduction initiative since taking office. This proposal regarding the reduction of conventional forces in Europe was widely welcomed by NATO countries and Western public opinion. In terms of timing, Bush's proposal helped the NATO summit to turn a potential crisis into an opportunity, bridging the gap within NATO.

Due to the evolving situation in Europe, there were differing views within NATO on the prospects of easing East-West relations and arms reduction, and the summit was facing a serious test. For the United States, the challenge was even more pronounced. First, in the more than half a year since Bush was elected as the American president, the Soviet Union had taken the initiative several times on arms reduction issues. In particular, Soviet leader Gorbachev, during his meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Baker on May 11, further proposed new suggestions for European arms reduction, and the calls for arms reduction in European countries were growing. In contrast, the United States had not been able to propose corresponding strategies for a long time, facing criticism both domestically and internationally. Secondly, in the past month, a far-reaching debate over short-range missiles had erupted within NATO countries, especially between the United States and West Germany, casting a shadow over the summit. For a while, the outcome of the summit and whether the United States could maintain its leadership position in the Western alliance became the focus of discussion. The situation forced the Bush administration to make a decision, and Bush's arms reduction initiative was formed under these circumstances.

Bush's arms reduction initiative affirmed the Soviet concessions, proposing specific suggestions such as reducing the number of aircraft, decreasing U.S. and Soviet troops in Europe, and accelerating the negotiation timeline. However, what had a significant impact on the NATO summit was that the United States adjusted its negotiating position, agreeing to include military personnel and combat aircraft in the arms reduction scope, thereby bringing the East-West positions closer together and meeting the wishes of Western European allies for arms reduction. At the same time, the United States agreed to hold short-range missile talks with the Soviet Union when a conventional arms reduction agreement in Europe is reached and implemented, satisfying West Germany's demand for "early" short-range missile talks. Other NATO allies also made concessions, agreeing to maintain the existing deterrence strategy and only implement "partial reductions" on short-range missiles, effectively rejecting the "third zero option." In this way, NATO countries finally reached a compromise on the main issues.

From the perspective of conventional arms reduction negotiations in Europe, Bush's initiative, like the new proposals from the Soviet leadership, will push the negotiation process forward. The New York Times believes that the new proposals from the United States and the Soviet Union have "put East and West on the path to reaching an agreement that can maintain military balance in Europe."

The main feature of Bush's new initiative is changing NATO's original negotiating position of "reducing weapons first, then reducing personnel and aircraft," agreeing to the Soviet demand to simultaneously reduce military personnel and aircraft, and proposing to reduce the number of aircraft to 15% less than the current NATO level. The U.S. and Soviet troops in Eastern and Western Europe will be reduced to an equal level of 275,000. Therefore, the trend of the U.S. and Soviet proposals is moving towards convergence. However, there are differences in specific issues such as the types of aircraft to be reduced. Moreover, European arms reduction involves 23 countries, and turning the arms reduction proposals into an arms reduction plan and formulating verification rules will be a very complex task. Therefore, it is generally believed that Bush's hope to reach an agreement within 6 to 12 months may be "too optimistic."

Bush's proposal to reduce arms at this time is an important step in the new administration's policy towards the Soviet Union and will undoubtedly have a positive impact on U.S.-Soviet relations. However, from the perspective of the Bush administration's review of U.S.-Soviet relations and the proposed policy, the overall attitude is cautious. It still proposes to test the Soviet Union's new thinking on a series of issues. According to U.S. newspapers, the Bush administration's "bold action" on arms reduction this time was quite tortuous, only responding after a careful analysis of Gorbachev's new proposals at the highest level. Baker recently explained Bush's arms reduction initiative, saying that the president's bold proposal "does not mean abandoning caution and realism." It seems that in the future, the U.S. attitude towards the Soviet Union will likely be more about responding to actual problems rather than undergoing drastic major changes.

　　布什的裁军倡议及其影响
    本报记者  张启昕
    在５月底举行的北约首脑会议上，布什总统提出了他执政以来的第一个裁军倡议。这个有关裁减欧洲常规力量的建议受到了北约国家和西方舆论的普遍欢迎。从时机上看，布什的建议使这次北约首脑会议化险为夷，弥合了北约内部的分歧。
    由于欧洲形势的发展，北约内部对东西方关系缓和和裁军前景出现了不同的看法，首脑会议一度面临严峻考验。对于美国，它面对的挑战则更为突出。首先，在布什当选为美国总统的半年多时间里，苏联几次在裁军问题上采取主动，特别是苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫５月１１日会见美国国务卿贝克时，进一步提出了欧洲裁军的新建议，欧洲国家裁军呼声日益高涨。相比之下，美国长期未能提出相应对策，受到国内外的批评。其次，近一个多月，在北约国家内部，特别在美国和西德之间爆发了一场影响深远的关于短程导弹的争论，给首脑会议蒙上了一层阴影。一时间，首脑会议的结局如何，美国在西方联盟的领导地位能否保持，就成了人们议论的中心话题。形势迫使布什政府作出决断，布什的裁军倡议就是在这种情况下形成的。
    布什的裁军倡议，肯定了苏联的让步，提出了裁减双方飞机数量、减少美苏驻欧军队、加速谈判时间表等具体建议。但对北约首脑会议产生巨大影响的是，美国调整了谈判立场，同意把军队人员和作战飞机列入裁军范围，从而使东西方的立场进一步接近，符合西欧盟国要求裁军的愿望。同时，美国同意在欧洲常规裁军达成协议并实施时，同苏联举行短导谈判，满足了西德要求美苏“尽早”举行短导谈判的愿望；北约其他盟国也作出了让步，即同意维持现有的威慑战略，只对短导实行“部分削减”，实际上否定了“第三个零点方案”。这样，北约国家终于在主要问题上达成妥协。
    从欧洲常规裁军谈判来看，布什的倡议和苏联领导人的新建议一样，都将推动谈判的进程。《纽约时报》认为，美苏两家的新建议“已使东西方走上了达成一项能使欧洲保持军事平衡的协议的道路”。
    布什新倡议的主要特点是改变北约原先提出的“先裁减武器，后裁减人员、飞机”的谈判立场，同意苏联的要求，即同时削减军事人员和飞机，并提出飞机数量削减到比北约现有数量少１５％的水平，苏美在东西欧的驻军削减到２７．５万同等水平，因此，美苏建议的趋势是走向接近。然而，在裁减飞机类型等具体问题上，美苏的说法不一。再说欧洲裁军涉及２３个国家，要把裁军建议形成裁军方案并制定出核查规则，将是十分复杂的工作。因此一般认为，布什希望６个月至１２个月就达成协议，可能“过分乐观”。
    布什在当前提出裁军倡议，是美国新政府对苏政策中的重要步骤，无疑将对美苏关系产生积极影响。但从布什政府完成对苏关系回顾所提出的对苏政策来看，总的态度偏于谨慎，它还提出要在一系列问题上考验苏联的新思维。据美国报纸透露，布什政府这次在裁军上采取“大胆行动”颇费周折，只是在最高层对戈尔巴乔夫新建议进行仔细分析之后才作出响应。贝克最近在解释布什裁军倡议时说，总统提出这项大胆建议“并不意味着放弃谨慎和现实主义”。看来，今后的美国对苏态度更多的可能是在解决实际问题上作出对策，而不会发生急剧的重大变化。
