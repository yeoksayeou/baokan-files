	Xining Busts a Counter-Revolutionary Organization

	XINING, June 28 (Xinhua) — The Xining Municipal Public Security Bureau of Qinghai Province has announced the dismantling of a counter-revolutionary organization named the "Chinese People's Democratic Opposition Party Alliance." The ringleader, Yu Zhenbin, has been arrested by the public security authorities.

	Yu Zhenbin, 27, was previously an employee of the Qinghai Provincial Archives Bureau.

	Investigations have revealed that Yu has long held a reactionary stance and harbored hatred towards the Communist Party of China and the socialist system. After the turmoil in Beijing spread to Qinghai in mid-May, Yu eagerly emerged, delivering speeches three times in front of the provincial government building. He maliciously attacked and slandered Party and state leaders, criticized the Four Cardinal Principles, and engaged in counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement.

	He also wrote and distributed reactionary leaflets in public places such as Xidajie and Dashizi in Xining, calling for "amending the constitution, electing a new central government, complete independence of the armed forces, and abolishing one-party rule."

	After the State Council issued the order to impose martial law in parts of Beijing on May 20, Yu accelerated his counter-revolutionary activities in defiance of the central government's wise decision.

	Yu drafted the charter for the counter-revolutionary organization, printed membership forms, recruited members, and secretly established the "Chinese People's Democratic Opposition Party Alliance." He openly advocated for "overthrowing the Communist Party, toppling the Communist Party's leadership, and striving to replace the Communist Party's leadership of China." The case is currently under further investigation.

　　西宁破获一反革命组织
    新华社西宁６月２８日电  记者从青海省西宁市公安局获悉：西宁市公安机关日前破获了一个名为“中国人民民主反对党同盟”的反革命组织，建立这个组织的反革命分子余振斌已被公安机关依法逮捕。
    反革命分子余振斌现年２７岁，捕前系青海省档案局干部。
    现经查证，余犯长期坚持反动立场，仇视中国共产党和社会主义制度。今年５月中旬，北京发生的动乱波及到青海以后，余振斌迫不及待地跳了出来，先后三次在省政府门前发表演讲，肆意攻击、诽谤党和国家领导人，攻击四项基本原则，进行反革命宣传、煽动。
    他还将自己书写的反动传单复印后在西宁市西大街、大十字等公共场所张贴、散发，疯狂叫嚣要“修改宪法，改选中央政府，武装力量彻底独立，废除一党专制”等。
    ５月２０日，国务院发布在北京部分地区实行戒严的命令后，余振斌为了对抗中央的英明决策，加紧了其反革命活动的进程。
    余振斌炮制了反革命组织的章程，印制了入党表格，发展了成员，秘密组织了“中国人民民主反对党同盟”，公然提出要“打倒共产党，推翻共产党领导，争取取代共产党领导中国。”目前，此案正在进一步审理中。
