    Leveraging the Power of Supervision to Punish Corruption
    Shanxi Cracks Down on Corrupt Officials
    A Batch of Powerful Officials Violating Laws and Discipline Are Punished

    The Shanxi Provincial Supervision Departments have exerted their authority to resolutely investigate and punish a batch of corrupt officials who hold real power, promoting the construction of clean governance.

    From January to May this year, the supervision departments at various levels in Shanxi Province received 3,211 reports of corruption cases from the public. They conducted preliminary investigations and initiated cases for 313 of these, with 170 cases already concluded. Twenty-five individuals have been recommended to judicial authorities for criminal prosecution, and 117 individuals, including eight at the county level, have been given or recommended for administrative penalties. Preliminary calculations show that economic losses amounting to 4.78 million yuan have been recovered.

    Among the corruption cases investigated by the supervision departments, a significant portion involved officials with real power. The deputy county magistrate of Hequ County, Han Tao, used his position to embezzle and misappropriate state and collective assets to build private homes, causing a bad influence, and has been severely punished under party and administrative discipline. The director of the Yanbei Regional Bureau of Industry and Commerce, Wang Baoyu, abused his authority, violated laws and discipline, and sought personal gain, and his case has been basically clarified. Some counties in the Lvliang Region resold over 70 vehicles, which were sold to them at a preferential price by the state for poverty alleviation, making a profit, which has caused strong dissatisfaction among the poor population, and further investigation is underway. Among the cases reported by the public, 19 involve officials at the bureau level, with 5 already under investigation.

    Provincial Governor Wang Senhao told the supervision department officials that the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government will not protect anyone. We will definitely take every report from the public seriously and investigate thoroughly. Anyone who violates party discipline and state laws will be severely punished without mercy.

　　发挥监察威力　惩治贪污腐败    
    山西严查贪污受贿干部    
    一批握有实权者违法乱纪受惩处
    本报太原６月２１日电  记者王艾生报道：山西省各级监察部门发挥威力，坚决查处一批握有实权干部的贪污受贿案件，促进廉政建设。
    今年１月至５月，山西省各级监察机关收到群众举报贪污受贿案３２１１件，案前调查、立案查处３１３件，现已结案１７０件，移送司法机关建议追究刑事责任２５人，已给予或建议给予政纪处分１１７人，其中县级干部８人。初步计算，挽回经济损失４７８万元。
    在监察部门查处的这批贪污受贿案件中，有相当一部分是握有实权的干部。河曲县副县长韩涛利用职权，贪污、侵占国家和集体资财营建私房，造成了恶劣影响，已受到党纪、政纪的严厉制裁；雁北地区工商局局长汪宝玉依仗权势，违法乱纪，以权谋私，已基本查清；吕梁地区一些县将国家以优惠价卖给他们扶贫用的汽车，倒卖７０余辆，从中牟利，引起贫困地区群众强烈不满，正在进一步核查。群众举报揭发的这批案件中，涉及到厅局级干部１９人，现已立案查处的有５人。
    山西省省长王森浩对监察部门的同志说，省委、省政府决不袒护哪个人，凡是群众举报的案件，我们一定认真对待，一定查个水落石出，凡是违犯党纪国法的，一定严惩不贷。
