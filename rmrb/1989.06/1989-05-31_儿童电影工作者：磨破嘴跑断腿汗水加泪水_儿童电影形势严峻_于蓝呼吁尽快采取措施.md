According to a report by the *China Culture Daily*, recently, renowned film actress and chairman of the China Children's Film and Television Center, Yu Lan, said in an interview with a reporter: "For children's films, we have 'worn-out mouths, broken legs, sweat and tears.' Children's films are facing a crisis!"

She said, "During the Cultural Revolution, China only produced one children's film—*Sparks Amidst the Reeds*. After the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee, the state began to pay attention to children's art education. On June 1, 1981, the world's second children's film studio after the Soviet Union was established in Beijing, which is the 'China Children's Film Studio.' The state requires the country to produce 12 children's films annually, but over the past nine years, the country has averaged 7.8 films per year. Compared to the old China's 0.8 films per year and 2.8 films per year before the Cultural Revolution, this is progress. However, China now has 380 million children, and what are 7.8 films compared to that? Moreover, the children's films that are produced are not all able to reach the young audience!"

Yu Lan said, "The ticket price for children's films is only around 0.25 yuan, while adult tickets are around 1 yuan. However, screening children's films and adult films incurs the same tax. The more children's films a cinema screens, the more it loses money, so it is unwilling to accept copies of children's films. The film distribution departments are therefore unwilling to purchase copies of children's films from film studios. Film studios work hard to produce children's films, but because they cannot sell the copies, producing one children's film generally results in a loss of around 300,000 yuan. Thus, the studios are unwilling to produce children's films. In 1987, 132 feature films were produced nationwide, selling 17,110 copies, while 10 children's films only sold 601 copies; in 1988, 152 feature films sold 15,746 copies, while 14 children's films only sold 534 copies."

Yu Lan said, "The studios are unwilling to produce, and the cinemas are unwilling to screen, so children are increasingly unable to see their own films, forming a vicious cycle. The other day, I went to Hai'an County. The manager of the county's film and drama company almost tearily showed me the children's film schedule for last summer. All the films were from before the Cultural Revolution, and none were from after the Third Plenum. Hai'an is a economically developed county in Jiangsu with 200,000 children, and it is like this, so what are the children in remote mountainous areas watching?"

Yu Lan sadly told the reporter: "Children's films have fewer opportunities to be shown, and among children, very few know about Premier Zhou, Huang Jiguang, and Dong Cunrui, while almost 100% know about Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse, and Huo Yuanjia!"

She pointed out that on one hand, children's films are facing a crisis, and on the other hand, adult films are being produced at a rate of about 120 films per year, and many of the scenes are not suitable for children to watch. Therefore, the government should provide support for children's films. I think children's films should not only be tax-exempt but also receive subsidies, so as to guide the market, promote the production of children's films, and motivate film and drama theaters and production studios.

Yu Lan said, "China's children's films have a great future if they are truly valued. Since the founding of the nation, one-quarter of China's children's films have won awards abroad. As long as everyone, from top to bottom, joins hands for the children, saving and revitalizing China's children's film industry is within reach!"

　　儿童电影工作者：磨破嘴跑断腿汗水加泪水
    儿童电影形势严峻
    于蓝呼吁尽快采取措施
    本报讯  据《中国文化报》报道：不久前，著名电影演员、中国儿童少年电影电视中心主席于蓝在接受记者采访时说：“为了儿童电影，我们是‘磨破嘴，跑断腿，汗水加泪水’。儿童电影面临危机啊！”
    她说，“文革”中我国只出过一部儿童影片——《闪闪的红星》。十一届三中全会以后，国家开始重视儿童艺术教育。１９８１年６月１日，世界上继苏联之后的第二个儿童电影制片厂在北京成立了，这就是“中国儿童电影制片厂”。国家要求全国每年能生产儿童片１２部，但９年来，全国平均年产７．８部，同旧中国年产０．８部和“文革”前年产２．８部相比，是进步了。但是，我国现在已拥有儿童３．８亿了，这７．８部又算得了什么？更何况拍出来的儿童片并不是都能同小观众见面！
    于蓝说，儿童影片的票价只在０．２５元左右，而成人票却在１元左右，但放儿童片与放成人片要交一样的税。电影院越放儿童电影就越亏本，它就不愿意要儿童片的拷贝。电影发行部门因此也就不愿意向电影厂家购买儿童片拷贝。电影厂辛辛苦苦拍出儿童片，由于卖不出拷贝，拍一部儿童片一般得倒贴３０万左右，这样厂家也就不愿意拍儿童片了。１９８７年全国生产１３２部故事片卖出拷贝１７１１０个，而１０部儿童片只卖了６０１个拷贝；１９８８年１５２部故事片卖了１５７４６个拷贝，１４部儿童片只卖出５３４个拷贝。
    于蓝说，厂家不愿拍，影院不愿放，儿童就愈加看不到自己的影片已形成恶性循环。前几天，我到海安县，这个县的影剧公司经理几乎含着泪拿出去年暑期孩子们的看片安排给我看，片子全部是“文革”前的，没有一部是三中全会以后的。海安可是江苏一个经济发达、有２０万儿童的县啊，发达地区尚且如此，边远山区的孩子们都在看些什么？
    于蓝沉痛地告诉记者：儿童片上映的机会少了，儿童中知道周总理、黄继光、董存瑞的寥寥无几，而知道唐老鸭、米老鼠、霍元甲的几乎１００％！
    她指出，儿童片一方面面临危机，另一方面成人片却以每年１２０部上下的速度在生产，而其中不少镜头是根本不适合儿童看的。因此，在儿童电影这个问题上政府应当给予扶持。我以为儿童片不仅要减免税，还应当给予补贴，这样才能引导市场，引导儿童片生产，调动影剧院和生产厂家的积极性。
    于蓝说，我国的儿童电影只要真正得到重视还是大有前途的，建国以来，我国有１／４的儿童片都在国外得了奖。只要从上到下，为了孩子携起手来，拯救和振兴我国的儿童电影事业还是指日可待的！
