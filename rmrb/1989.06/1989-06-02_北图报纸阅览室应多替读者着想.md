Title: The Newspaper Reading Room of the National Library of China Should Consider Readers More

Recently, due to work needs, I often go to the newspaper reading room of the Beijing Library to browse newspapers. The facilities of this reading room can be considered top-notch in the country, but the management and service levels are disappointing.

Firstly, the opening hours are short. Other reading rooms in the Beijing Library, such as the periodical reading room and the new book reading room, are open for 6 days a week, with borrowing times from 8 AM to 8 PM. Only the newspaper reading room is open for 5 days a week and closes at 5 PM every day.

Secondly, there are few types of newspapers, which cannot meet the needs of readers. The reading room currently provides about 100 types of newspapers for browsing. Many national newspapers, such as the China Transportation News, People's Public Security News, People's Postal and Telecommunications News, and Construction News, are not displayed in the reading room. Many influential local newspapers, such as the United Daily and Social Sciences News from Shanghai, are also rarely seen in the reading room.

Thirdly, newspapers are not put on the shelves in a timely manner. In April this year, when I was browsing the People's Political Consultative Conference News in the newspaper reading room, the newspapers in the newspaper holder were still from December 1988; the Shanghai News in the newspaper holder only had the issue from January 7, 1989.

Some newspapers are taken off the shelves and their whereabouts are unknown. Newspapers from other provinces and cities usually take about 10 days to be put on the shelves, but the newspaper reading room stipulates that only the current month's newspapers can be placed in the newspaper holder. Therefore, when the newspapers from other provinces and cities arrive in the latter part of the month, they are often taken away before readers can see them. Many newspapers that have been taken off the newspaper holder are neither stored nor lent out, and their whereabouts are unknown.

The Beijing Library is the national library, and the newspaper reading room of the Beijing Library should be a model for newspaper reading rooms across the country. I hope that the responsible comrades and staff of the Beijing Library and the newspaper reading room will make efforts to change this situation and no longer let readers come with high hopes and leave disappointed.

### 北图报纸阅览室应多替读者着想

　　北图报纸阅览室应多替读者着想
    最近，因工作需要，我时常到北京图书馆报纸阅览室翻阅报纸。这个阅览室的设备堪称国内一流，但管理和服务水平却令人失望。
    首先是开放时间短。北京图书馆的其它阅览室，如期刊阅览室、中文新书阅览室等，都是每周开放６天，借阅书刊的时间，从早８点至晚８点。唯独报纸阅览室每周只开放５天，每天下午５点就关门。
    其次是报纸种类少，不能满足读者需要。阅览室现供阅览的报纸约１００种，许多全国性报纸，如中国交通报、人民公安报、人民邮电报、建设报等，阅览室里均未陈列。许多有影响的地方报纸，如上海的联合时报、社会科学报等，阅览室里也难得一见。
    再次是报纸上架不及时，今年４月，我在报纸阅览室查阅人民政协报，报夹上的报纸仍是１９８８年１２月份的；报夹上的上海新闻报只有１９８９年１月７日那一张。
    有些报纸下架后去向不明。外地报纸一般要迟１０天左右才能上架，但报纸阅览室却规定报夹上只夹当月报。这样，每月下旬的外地报纸来了后，往往未与读者见面就收了起来。许多下了报夹的外地报纸既不收藏也不借阅，就此不知下落。
    北京图书馆是国家图书馆，北京图书馆报纸阅览室应当是全国报纸阅览室的楷模。切望北京图书馆及报纸阅览室的负责同志和工作人员作出努力改变这种现状，再不要让读者慕名而来、失望而归了。
