The State Council Office yesterday issued an emergency notice, requiring all regions to strengthen cultural relics security work under the current situation.

The notice said that the counterrevolutionary riots in Beijing in early June and the disturbances in some places have basically been quelled, and social order is gradually returning to normal. However, the situation remains complicated, and a very small number of counterrevolutionary rioters are not willing to admit defeat, and the struggle continues. In this complex situation, to prevent cultural relics from being attacked and destroyed by bad elements, and to ensure the absolute safety of all types of cultural relics, the following instructions are issued:

1. All levels of people's governments should strengthen their leadership over cultural relics management departments, organize them to seriously study the Party Central Committee and the State Council's "Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Nation," especially to seriously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech on June 9 when he met with military officers at the level of division and above from the martial law troops. They should resolutely implement all instructions and orders from the Party Central Committee and the State Council to stop the disturbances and quell the counterrevolutionary riots. They should unify their thinking, observe discipline, be loyal to their duties, and in political and practical actions, maintain consistency with the Party Central Committee and the State Council.

2. In any situation, the leadership of all levels of people's governments and cultural relics management departments must ensure the absolute safety of cultural relics. All cultural relics units at various levels should formulate practical and feasible cultural relics security prevention measures, with leaders taking responsibility and assigning tasks to specific individuals. In cities or regions where social order has not yet fully returned to normal, museums or cultural relics units without security guarantees should not be opened hastily. Cultural relics storage rooms should be properly sealed. Precious cultural relics on display should be stored in cultural relics storage rooms or moved to safe places for proper preservation.

3. In case of emergencies, local people's governments and cultural relics management departments should coordinate with public security and military units. For particularly important cultural relics collection units, armed protection forces should be increased. Protecting cultural relics is a glorious task for the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and public security officers. Cultural relics units with stationed troops should actively do propaganda and service work, strengthen military-civilian unity, and closely cooperate and collaborate, with both military and civilians shouldering the responsibility of protecting the cultural relics of our motherland.

4. Political and ideological work should be strengthened among cultural relics unit staff to enhance their sense of mission and responsibility in protecting cultural relics. At any time and in any situation, the stability and unity of the cultural relics team must be maintained. All staff and workers in cultural relics units must strictly observe discipline, strictly prohibit participation in any activities that are not conducive to stopping disturbances and riots, and work hard to establish normal social and work order.

5. Heighten vigilance and prevent a small number of rioters and bad elements from targeting the destruction and burning of cultural relics and ancient sites as objects of revenge while fleeing. For all cultural relics units that are open to the public, attention should be paid to observing suspicious individuals mixed among the visitors. If there are signs that an incident may occur, appropriate measures should be taken immediately to deal with it.

6. Cultural relics are precious treasures of the entire nation and all of humanity. Protecting cultural relics from damage is a glorious mission bestowed by history on all the people of the nation, especially cultural relics workers. At present, all levels of people's governments and cultural relics management departments should fully play their roles, and on the premise of ensuring the safety of cultural relics, strive to use cultural relics to conduct patriotic education and revolutionary tradition education for the people, especially the younger generation. This will help them correctly understand the glorious history of the diligent, brave, and hardworking struggle of the Chinese nation, inherit and carry forward the excellent traditions of the nation, enhance national self-confidence and pride, and strive to contribute to the great cause of building modernization and revitalizing China.

　　国务院办公厅紧急通知     
    加强文物安全工作    
    警惕坏人冲击破坏　保证各类文物安全
    新华社北京６月２３日电  国务院办公厅昨天发出紧急通知，要求各地在当前形势下加强文物安全工作。
    通知说，６月初北京发生的反革命暴乱和一些地方发生的动乱已经基本平息，社会秩序逐渐恢复正常。但是，情况仍然比较复杂，极少数反革命暴乱分子并不甘心失败，斗争还在继续。在复杂的情况下，为防止文物古迹遭到坏人的冲击和破坏，保证各类文物的绝对安全，现就有关问题通知如下：
    一、各级人民政府要加强对文物管理部门的领导，组织他们认真学习党中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》，特别要认真学习邓小平同志６月９日接见戒严部队军以上干部时的重要讲话，坚决执行党中央、国务院关于制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的一切指示、命令，统一认识，遵守纪律，忠于职守，在政治上、行动上与党中央、国务院保持一致。
    二、各级人民政府领导和文物主管部门在任何情况下，都要保证文物的绝对安全。各级文博单位要制定切实可行的文物安全防范措施，领导负责，责任到人。在社会秩序尚未全面恢复正常的城市或地区，凡无安全保证的博物馆或文物开放单位，不宜急于开放。文物库房要妥善封存。陈列展出的珍贵文物，要撤存文物库房或转移到安全地方妥善保管。
    三、遇有紧急情况，各地人民政府和文物主管部门要与公安、驻军联系。对特别重要的文物收藏单位，要增加武装保卫力量。保护文物安全是人民解放军和武警、公安干警的一项光荣任务。驻有军队的文博单位要主动做好宣传和服务工作，加强军民团结，密切协作配合，军民共同肩负起保护祖国文物安全的重任。
    四、要加强文博单位工作人员的政治思想工作，提高他们保护文物的使命感和责任心。在任何时候和任何情况下都要保持文博队伍的稳定和团结。文博单位所有干部、职工要严守纪律，严禁参与一切不利于制止动乱和暴乱的活动，并且为建立正常的社会和工作秩序努力做好各项工作。
    五、提高警惕，防止一小撮暴徒和坏人在逃窜过程中把砸毁、焚烧文物古迹作为报复对象。凡是开放参观的文物单位，要注意观察混迹于观众之中的可疑分子。如有迹象表明可能发生意外，要当即采取适当措施进行处置。
    六、文物是全民族和全人类的宝贵财富，保护好文物不受损失是历史赋予全国人民特别是文物工作者的光荣使命。目前，各级人民政府和文物管理部门要充分发挥作用，在确保文物安全的前提下，努力通过文物向人民群众特别是青少年一代进行爱国主义教育和革命传统教育，帮助他们正确认识中华民族勤劳勇敢、艰苦奋斗的光辉历史，继承和弘扬民族优良传统，增强民族自信心和自豪感，为建设四化、振兴中华的伟大事业而努力奉献。
