Soviet and Bulgarian leaders believe that, although there are many similarities in the reforms of the two countries, it is dangerous and has no future to copy other countries' experiences without considering the characteristics of one's own country.

According to TASS, Soviet leader Gorbachev met with the visiting Bulgarian leader Zhivkov today, and the two sides exchanged views on the reform issues of their respective countries.

Gorbachev said that the Soviet Union currently does not have a complete concept for the development of all fields of society. However, the main links that have been determined are correct—democratization of the economic system, social system, and spiritual life, and the establishment of a law-based state; otherwise, democracy will degenerate into anarchy. He admitted that the Soviet Union is currently facing many difficulties in both the socio-economic field and ethnic relations.

Zhivkov said that the main point of Bulgaria's economic reform is to establish companies with extensive rights in the form of cooperatives, and these companies will in the future assume 80% of the economic functions currently performed by the government and various ministries.

In terms of developing bilateral economic cooperation, the leaders of the two countries advocate establishing more joint ventures.

Zhivkov arrived in the Soviet Union today for a working visit.

　　戈尔巴乔夫会见日夫科夫    
    双方认为照搬别国经验没有出路
    新华社莫斯科６月２３日电  苏联和保加利亚领导人认为，两国的改革虽有许多相似点，但不考虑本国特点照搬别国经验是没有出路和危险的。
    据塔斯社报道，苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫今天会见了正在这里访问的保加利亚领导人日夫科夫，双方就各自国家的改革问题交换了意见。
    戈尔巴乔夫说，苏联目前并不拥有社会发展各领域的完备概念。但是，已确定的主要环节是正确的——经济体制、社会体制和精神生活的民主化，建立法制国家，否则民主会变成无政府状态。他承认，苏联目前不论在社会经济领域，还是民族关系领域，都面临许多难题。
    日夫科夫说，保加利亚经济改革的主要点是建立有广泛权利的合作社式的公司，这些公司今后将承担目前政府和各部８０％的经济职能。
    在发展双边经济合作方面，两国领导人主张建立更多的联合公司。
    日夫科夫是今天到苏联进行工作访问的。
