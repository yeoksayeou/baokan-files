The Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications will issue a commemorative stamped envelope titled "40th Anniversary of China's Record Publishing Industry" on June 6th. This year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of China's record publishing industry.

The record publishing industry is an important part of the cultural sector and plays a significant role in international cultural exchanges. Over the past 40 years, the China Record Company has evolved from simply producing records to becoming a comprehensive audio-visual publishing unit that produces audio and video tapes, laser discs, record players, and broadcasting equipment. This development has contributed to enriching the cultural lives of the people and promoting the construction of spiritual civilization.

The design of the commemorative envelope features a circular stamp symbolizing a record, composed of a record, audio tape, and video tape. The envelope itself depicts the rapid development from old-fashioned record players to modern video equipment.

The commemorative envelope was designed by Pan Keming of the Stamp Issuance Bureau.

　　邮电部发行纪念邮资信封

    唱片出版事业是文化事业的重要组成部分，并担负着国际文化交流的使命。４０年来，中国唱片公司从简单的生产唱片，发展到具有生产录音录像磁带、激光唱片、唱机、播控设备的综合音像出版单位，为活跃人民文化生活，促进精神文明建设做出了贡献。纪念封邮票图案设计成圆形。象征唱片，由唱片、录音带、录像带组成；信封图案则表现了从老式唱机到录像设备的飞速发展过程。
    这枚纪念封由邮票发行局潘可明设计。
