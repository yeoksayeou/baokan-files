	Price Increases and Shortages
	Agricultural Resources After Monopolization
	Experts Urge the State to Quickly Take Coordinating Measures to Reverse the Situation

	Information from rural areas across the country indicates that since agricultural production materials were monopolized, the situation of high prices and shortages has not been reversed and is even worsening in many places. Recently, at the national "Three Summer" fieldwork meeting held in Xiangfan, Hubei, leaders and experts from the forestry departments across the country expressed great concern about this issue. They hope that the state will quickly take coordinating measures to reverse the situation of high prices and shortages of agricultural resources, creating conditions to ensure a bumper harvest this year.

	According to a responsible person from the Ministry of Agriculture, after the monopolization of fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic film, the problem of multiple entities intervening and reselling has been relatively well solved. However, some places have not effectively controlled the price increases. According to the situation summarized from more than 200 information points nationwide, prices have shown an upward trend after monopolization. The comprehensive average price of agricultural production materials rose again in March after rising in February. Among them, the comprehensive price of nitrogen-phosphorus-potassium compound fertilizer, urea, and ammonium bicarbonate increased by 7% to 9% or more, and the comprehensive price of superphosphate increased by 11.02%. Currently, the price of agricultural production materials is still on an upward trend.

	More worrying is that in some regions, the commercial departments have reduced or delayed, or even stopped purchasing after monopolization. Especially, pesticides have encountered circulation obstacles, factory backlogs, and farmers are extremely anxious about not being able to buy pesticides. According to reports from Shandong, Hebei, Henan, Anhui, Shanxi, and Shaanxi provinces, the current shortage of pesticides is 10,118 tons, and the shortage of pesticides for cotton and rice pest control will be even greater in the future.

	China's planting industry has been stagnant for four consecutive years, and the supply and demand situation of major agricultural products, especially grain, is quite severe. Responsible persons and experts from the agricultural sector pointed out that if the problem of high prices and shortages of agricultural resources after monopolization is not quickly resolved, it will be difficult to reverse the stagnant situation in agriculture.

　　价格上涨　货源短缺
    农资专营后状况堪忧
    专家呼吁国家尽快采取配套措施扭转局面
    新华社武汉６月４日电  （记者施勇峰）来自全国农村各地的信息表明，农业生产资料实行专营后，价高货缺的状况还没有得到扭转，在许多地方这一矛盾还在加剧。最近在湖北襄樊市召开的全国“三夏”现场工作会议上，全国各地林业部门的负责人和专家对此表示了极大的忧虑。他们希望国家尽快采取配套措施，扭转农资供应价高货缺的状况，为确保今年农业丰收创造条件。
    据农业部负责人介绍，化肥、农药和农膜实行专营后，比较好地解决了多头插手、倒买倒卖的问题，但一些地方仍未有效地控制住价格的上涨。从全国２００多个信息点汇总的情况看，专营后价格呈上涨势头。农用生产资料的商业综合平均价，继２月份上涨后，３月份又有明显上升。其中氮磷钾复合肥、尿素、碳酸氢铵的综合价上涨幅度达７％至９％以上，普通过磷酸钙综合价上涨１１．０２％。目前，农用生产资料价格仍呈继续上涨势头。
    更令人担忧的是，有些地区商业部门在专营后，压缩或延缓、甚至停止收购，特别是农药出现流通阻塞，工厂积压，农民为买不到农药而万分焦虑。据山东、河北、河南、安徽、山西、陕西等省反映，目前农药缺口达１０１１８吨，今后棉花、水稻病虫防治用药的缺口更大。
    我国种植业生产已经连续４年徘徊，主要农产品特别是粮食供需形势相当严峻，农业部门的负责人和专家指出，如不迅速解决专营后农资价高货缺的问题，就难于扭转农业的徘徊局面。
