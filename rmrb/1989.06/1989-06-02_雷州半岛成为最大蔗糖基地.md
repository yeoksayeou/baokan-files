The sugarcane crushing season in Guangdong has just ended. The Leizhou Peninsula's sugar production has reached half of the province's total output, accounting for 1/9 of the national total.

In the early 1980s, the Leizhou Peninsula was only sporadically cultivating sugarcane. In recent years, it has rapidly developed, with the current planting area reaching 182.8 thousand acres. This crushing season, the sugarcane crushing volume exceeded 525 million tons, producing over 550,000 tons of sugar, increasing by 22.1% and 27.3% respectively compared to the previous season, reaching a historical high.

To adapt to the development trend, the city of Zhanjiang, which administers the Leizhou Peninsula, has raised funds through multiple channels to build and put into operation 30 large and medium-sized sugar mills.

　　雷州半岛成为最大蔗糖基地
    本报讯  广东甘蔗榨季刚结束，雷州半岛产糖量已达全省总量的一半，为全国总量的１／９。
    ８０年代初还只是零星种植甘蔗的雷州半岛，近年来异军突起，目前种植面积达１８２．８万亩。这个榨季的榨蔗量超过５２５万吨，产糖５５万吨以上，分别比去年榨季增长２２．１％和２７．３％，达到历史最高水平。
    为了适应发展态势，管辖雷州半岛的湛江市，多渠道集资，建成投产大、中型糖厂３０家。
