North Korea Agrees to Resume North-South Parliamentary Talks

	BEIJING, June 20 — Reporter Xu Baokang reports: The North Korean delegation to the North-South Parliamentary Joint Conference, led by Chon Kim-Chol, today sent a letter to the chief representative of the South Korean parliamentary delegation, Chae Won-sik, agreeing to resume the North-South parliamentary talks that have been suspended for six months. The letter proposes that the eighth meeting be held on June 28 at Panmunjom.

	The letter states that the reason for the suspension of the North-South parliamentary representatives' meeting on December 29 last year was the South Korean side's insistence on holding the "Cooperation Spirit '89" joint military exercise.

	The letter states that the South recently proposed to resume the North-South parliamentary representatives' meeting, which is a sign that the South is removing obstacles. Therefore, the North has decided to resume the meeting between the two sides at Panmunjom. However, Chon Kim-Chol said in the letter that the South Korean side should release Pastor Mun Yŏng-hwan to show their sincerity in creating a dialogue atmosphere.

	The letter especially emphasizes that the urgent issue that needs to be addressed in the current North-South parliamentary talks is to avoid empty talk and solve practical problems.

　　朝北方同意恢复北南国会会谈
    本报平壤６月２０日电  记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜北南国会联合会议北方代表团团长全金哲今天致函南方国会议员代表团首席代表蔡汶植，同意恢复中断了６个月的北南国会会谈，并建议６月２８日在板门店举行第８次会晤。
    信件说，去年１２月２９日北南国会代表会晤中断的原因是南朝鲜方面坚持举行“协作精神８９”联合军事演习。
    信件说，南方最近提出了恢复北南国会代表会晤的建议，这是南方排除障碍的一种表示，因此北方决定恢复双方在板门店的会晤。但是全金哲在信中说，南朝鲜方面应该释放文益焕牧师，以表明他们对造成对话气氛具有诚意。
    信件特别强调，目前北南国会会谈迫切需要解决的问题是不讲空话，解决实际问题。
