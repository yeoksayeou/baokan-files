Today, the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau held a commendation and celebration meeting. Forty individuals and 42 units that made outstanding contributions in stopping the counter-revolutionary riot and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion were awarded.

Leaders such as Li Ximing and Wang Fang attended the meeting to congratulate and speak.

Yan Guozhang, the squad leader of the Criminal Investigation Team of the Xicheng District Public Security Bureau, was awarded an individual first-class merit citation. On the night of June 3, he led two officers, skillfully maneuvering through a group of rioters and six roadblocks, and after a two-hour arduous struggle, successfully moved a military vehicle loaded with weapons, ammunition, and five PLA officers and soldiers to a safe area. The 42 officers of the Right Gate Station of the Fengtai District Public Security Bureau, in the face of 191 military vehicles being besieged at the Right Gate Bridge, took the initiative to strike, on the one hand, entering the residents to explain, on the other hand, organizing forces to combat the criminal elements' sabotage activities. After nearly two days of effort, 187 military vehicles were intact, making outstanding contributions to the protection of state property. The Municipal Public Security Bureau recommended that this station be awarded a collective first-class merit citation and reported to the Ministry of Public Security for approval.
