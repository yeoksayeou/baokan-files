	OPEC Increases Oil Production Quota

	The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) ministers' meeting reached an agreement on June 7th to raise the daily oil production ceiling for member countries in the second half of the year from 18.5 million barrels in the first half to 19.5 million barrels, while maintaining the official price of $18 per barrel of crude oil.

	Western oil market analysts believe that OPEC's newly set daily oil production quota is far below its current actual production. It is estimated that the 13 OPEC member countries are currently producing a total of 21 million barrels of crude oil per day.

	According to the new agreement, the additional 1 million barrels of daily oil production quota should be evenly distributed among OPEC member countries. However, Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates warned that they would not adhere to OPEC's production quotas and would instead determine their oil production based on their own national needs.

	Analysts predict that due to the lack of support from all member countries for OPEC's new agreement, oil prices may fall in the coming months.

### 欧佩克提高产油限额

　　欧佩克提高产油限额
    新华社维也纳６月７日电  石油输出国组织（欧佩克）部长级会议６月７日达成协议，将该组织成员国下半年的石油日产最高限额从上半年的１８５０万桶提高到１９５０万桶，并仍维持每桶原油１８美元的官价。
    西方石油市场分析家认为，欧佩克新确定的这个日产石油限额远远低于它目前的实际产量。据估计，欧佩克１３个成员国现在每天共生产原油２１００万桶。
    根据新协议，新增加的１００万桶石油日产配额应在欧佩克成员国之间按比例平均分摊。但科威特和阿拉伯联合酋长国警告说，它们将不理会欧佩克的生产配额，而根据各自国家的需要来决定原油产量。
    分析家们预计，由于欧佩克的新协议未获所有成员国的支持，今后几个月内原油的价格有可能下跌。
