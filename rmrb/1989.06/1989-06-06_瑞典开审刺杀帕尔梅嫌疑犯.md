The trial of the suspect in the assassination of former Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme began today in the Stockholm District Court. The trial is being conducted in a semi-public manner.

The suspect is a 42-year-old unemployed man, of a robust build, with a history of drug abuse and a previous conviction for stabbing. The prosecutor, based on the evidence at hand, accused the suspect of following Palme and his wife in the center of Stockholm on February 28, 1986, and shooting Palme from behind, killing him and wounding Mrs. Palme.

The suspect denied the charges in court. His defense lawyer argued that the evidence was insufficient and that the suspect lacked a motive, suggesting that "many indications point to this being an organized, politically motivated assassination."

The Palme assassination case has been ongoing for over three years. Initially, the police failed to take adequate measures to secure the crime scene, which has made the investigation difficult. Several suspects were detained but released due to lack of evidence. The police had focused on a Kurdish organization, suspecting that the group acted because Palme had stopped the sale of weapons to Iran. Two members of this organization were detained but later released due to lack of evidence. Since last winter, the police have focused on the aforementioned suspect, who not only has a criminal record but was also identified by more than ten eyewitnesses, including Mrs. Palme, as having followed the Palmes. Additionally, a friend of the suspect revealed that he had discussed Mrs. Palme's screams when her husband was shot. The suspect himself admitted to being near the crime scene that night. With court approval, the police formally arrested the suspect in mid-December last year.

The trial is expected to last several weeks and conclude on July 10. Currently, the evidence is largely circumstantial, and no eyewitnesses can testify to seeing the suspect with a gun. The police have not yet found the murder weapon, and the suspect has no known connection to Palme, lacking a clear motive. Therefore, many people in Sweden remain skeptical of the police's charges. A recent public opinion poll in the Stockholm area found that only 15% believe the suspect is the true culprit. In Sweden, trials must strictly adhere to the law, emphasizing evidence, and do not allow for hasty conclusions. People are waiting to see if the prosecutor can present more substantial evidence in court.

### 瑞典开审刺杀帕尔梅嫌疑犯

　　瑞典开审刺杀帕尔梅嫌疑犯
    本报斯德哥尔摩６月５日电  记者顾耀铭报道：瑞典斯德哥尔摩地区法院今天上午第一次正式开始审判刺杀瑞典前首相奥洛夫·帕尔梅的嫌疑犯。
    审判是以半公开的形式举行。嫌疑犯是一名４２岁的失业男子，身材魁梧，曾有过吸毒和用刺刀杀人记录。检察官根据所掌握的证据，在法庭上指控此人于１９８６年２月２８日在斯德哥尔摩市中心尾随帕尔梅夫妇，从背后开枪打死帕尔梅，并打伤帕尔梅夫人。
    该嫌疑犯在法庭上否认对他的指控。其辩护律师认为证据不足，嫌疑犯缺乏作案动机，并提出“许多迹象表明，此案是有组织、有计划的政治谋杀案”。
    帕尔梅被刺案已发生三年多了，由于发案初期，警方未能采取足够的措施保护现场，给侦破工作带来很大困难。警方曾拘留了一些嫌疑犯，均因证据不足而被释放。警方曾把侦破重点放在一个库尔德族人组织，怀疑该组织因帕尔梅曾制止向伊朗出售武器而作案。警方曾拘留了这个组织的２名成员，后因缺乏证据，被释放。从去年冬天开始，警方又把重点放在上述嫌疑犯，此人不仅有犯罪记录，而且包括帕尔梅夫人在内的十多名现场目击者都认出他当时尾随帕尔梅夫妇。另据他的朋友揭发，他曾谈到帕尔梅夫人在她丈夫被刺时是怎样尖叫的。他本人也承认那天晚上他在出事地点附近。经法院批准，警方于去年１２月中旬正式逮捕这名嫌疑犯。
    这次审判将要进行几个星期，到７月１０日结束。由于目前掌握的都属情况证据，目击者中无人能作证看到这名嫌疑犯持枪射击，警方尚未查获作案凶器，嫌疑犯与帕尔梅无任何联系，缺乏作案动机。因此，此间不少人士对警方的传讯仍持怀疑。最近在斯德哥尔摩地区举行的一次民意测验，仅有１５％的人认为这是真正的凶手，在瑞典，审判必须严格地遵循法律，重证据，不允许草率结案，人们正在等待检察官在法庭上能列出更充分的证据。
