On the evening of June 3rd, around 5 PM, we were ordered to carry out martial law tasks and advance into Beijing city. Along the way, we encountered obstacles, stopping and starting, and around 4 AM on the 4th, we reached a place (later we found out it was Shiliupu). As soon as the car stopped, someone climbed up and with a "swoosh" tore open the canvas cover. People below were pointing at us, some shaking their fists. A thug shouted "Beat them!" and then stones and bricks rained down on our vehicle. I used my arm to protect my head, but my nape still took several hits, blood flowing down to my neck. The instructor in the driver's seat was pulled out of the car by a group of thugs and beaten. His insignia and cap were torn off. The thugs then came up and forcibly pulled us out of the car. At that time, we were all carrying assault rifles and had ammunition. But we had not received orders to open fire, and we did not want to shoot at the people, so we hid the ammunition inside our uniforms. An assault rifle without ammunition is no better than a firewood stick. After being pulled out of the car, facing a crowd of people, it is easy to imagine the beating we took.

I was dazed and could only dodge into a factory's restroom. I washed the blood off my face and hands with water from the restroom. The blood on my uniform couldn't be wiped off, so I took off my pants, threw away my shirt, and walked out of the restroom in my underwear and undershirt to find my unit. As soon as I came out, I encountered someone who shouted from a distance, "Who is it? What are you doing? Are you a soldier?" I tried to run, but the person shouted again, "Don't run, it's dangerous outside!" Hearing this, I calmed down. Later, I found out that this person was a security officer from the Beijing First Textile Machinery Factory. He led me to the factory office, where the Party Secretary and the office director were called. They gave me water to drink and said, "Don't worry, it's absolutely safe here, there's no danger!" In that moment of crisis, hearing such reassurance, I couldn't help but shed tears.

They brought me food, skewering four steamed buns with chopsticks and a bowl of stir-fried melon and meat. I hadn't eaten for a day and a night, but I was anxious and wanted to find my unit, not knowing what had happened to my comrades or if the instructor was still alive. So, I had no appetite. They comforted me, "Eat, it's okay, don't be nervous. When things outside calm down a bit, we'll help you find your unit!" Like this, I stayed in the factory for two nights. The factory assigned a comrade surnamed Song to take care of me and found a doctor to dress my wounds.

On the morning of the 6th, the factory sent a small van to take me back to my unit. Fearing it was unsafe on the road, several factory leaders insisted on accompanying me. At that time, Beijing's traffic was still congested, and there were frequent incidents of thugs shooting and blocking military vehicles. If the thugs discovered a wounded soldier in the car, they would not let us go. I didn't want the factory leaders to take such a big risk for me and insisted they shouldn't go. But they said, "We won't be at ease until we hand you over to the unit leaders!"

Later, they removed the bandage from my head (to avoid attracting attention) and found civilian clothes for me to wear. They sat me in the middle of the van, took small roads, and it took over three hours to get me back to the unit.

I was saved, saved by the people of the capital! I will never forget the lifesaving kindness of the leaders and workers of the First Textile Machinery Factory! One day, when Beijing returns to normal, I will definitely find a way to repay them!

　　“首都群众救了我”
    ——戒严部队某部战士陈海波谈被救经过
    ６月３日晚５点多，我们奉命执行戒严任务朝北京市区开进。途中受阻，走走停停，大约４日早晨４点多，到了一个地方（后来才知道是十里堡）。车刚停，就有人爬上来“哗”地一声把篷布给扯开了。车下有人用手指着我们，有人挥动拳头。一个歹徒喊了声“打”，接着石块、砖头朝我们车上打来。我用胳膊护住头，但后脑勺还是挨了好几砖头，鲜血流到脖梗子。坐在驾驶室里的指导员被一伙歹徒拽下车，一顿暴揍。领章和帽子全让人撕巴了。歹徒们又上来生拉硬扯，拽我们下车。当时，我们都背着冲锋枪，也带了子弹。但我们没接到开枪的命令，也不想朝人民开枪，所以，把子弹都塞到内务里面藏了起来。没有子弹的冲锋枪还不如一根烧火棍子。我们被拽下车后，十几个人面对黑压压一群人，是怎样的拳打脚踢就可想而知了。
    我被打懵了，只好见空就钻，躲进了一家工厂的厕所里。我用厕所的水洗掉了脸上手上的血。军装上的血擦不掉，我只好脱掉军裤，扔掉上衣，穿个裤头和背心走出厕所去找部队。我刚出来，就碰到一个人，离老远大喊一声“谁？干什么的？是不是当兵的？”我刚想跑，那个人又朝我喊“你别跑，外面危险！”我一听这话，心里稳住了神。后来才知道，这个人是北京第一纺织机械厂保卫科的干部。他把我领到厂部，把党委书记、厂办公室主任都找来了。他们给我倒了水，让我喝，还对我说：“你放心，这里绝对安全，不会有任何危险！”在那种危难时刻，听到这种安慰，我止不住淌了眼泪。
    他们给我弄来了吃的，用筷子串了四个馒头，还有一饭盒瓜片炒肉。我已经一天一宿没吃东西了，但心里着急，想找部队，不知道战友们被打成啥样，也不知道指导员是否还活着，所以，没心思吃饭。他们安慰我：“吃吧，没事，别紧张，等外面稍消停点，我们就帮你找部队！”就这样，我在厂里住了两宿，厂里抽出一个姓宋的同志专门陪护我，还找来医生帮我包扎伤口。
    ６日上午，厂里派一个小面包车送我回部队。怕路上不安全，几个厂领导非要亲自送我不可。当时，北京市区交通仍然堵塞，歹徒打黑枪、堵军车的现象时有发生，如果被歹徒发现车里有一个解放军伤号，他们是不会放过的。我不想让厂领导为我这么一个兵担这么大风险，坚持不让他们去。但他们说：“不把你交给部队领导，我们放心不下啊！”
    后来，他们把我头上包扎伤口的纱布摘掉（怕引人注意），找来便衣，让我穿上，把我夹在面包车中间，一路走小道，用了三个多小时，才把我送回部队。
    我得救了，是首都群众救了我！我一辈子也忘不了第一纺织机械厂的领导和工人们的救命之恩。将来有一天，等北京恢复正常秩序那一天，一定要好好报答报答他们！
