The first time I saw her, I was certain: it was her, the only woman who, on the night of June 3, accompanied the martial law troops to clear Tiananmen Square—Minor Colonel Wang Jing, a military doctor from a certain medical unit.

She is of slight build, but not weak. Every move she makes is decisive and graceful; she is not beautiful, nor is she young, but her brow always bears a hint of vigor. Confidence, strength, and stubbornness are all written on her face. I thought to myself, this is a woman who is not hard to understand.

"I am strong-willed and never willing to yield," she said. This time, after the unit received the order to enforce martial law, the leadership decided she should stay behind at the base. This made her extremely anxious. She repeatedly sought out her superiors to present her arguments and express her determination, but still did not receive a satisfactory response. She was so frustrated that she even took cow-bezoar pills, but to no avail. Just before the unit was about to depart, she made one last attempt to convince her superiors: "If you let me go, I will go; if you don't let me go, I will still go. It's decided that I will go. Is it because I am a woman? Have you considered that I am first and foremost a soldier and a doctor! I can help the soldiers to bleed less and sacrifice less." As she finished speaking, her eyes welled up with tears. "To avoid trouble, I can sleep in the ambulance and go without water," she said. Seeing her determination, her superiors finally agreed to her request. For days, she had been frowning, but now she finally smiled and turned back to her room, throwing her already packed bag into the ambulance.

"Were you scared at the time?" I asked. "To be honest, although I act like a man, I had never experienced such a situation before. Our ambulance was particularly conspicuous in the night. As we moved forward, we often heard the rioters shouting, 'Smash the ambulance!' and the sound of stones hitting the car. The car windows were all shattered. Wearing a steel helmet, I didn't even have time to wipe the sweat from my brow. I held my pistol in one hand and the first aid kit in the other, ready at any moment to jump out and rescue the injured."

At around 1:00 AM on June 4, the ambulance entered the western side of Tiananmen Square with the troops. She immediately jumped out of the car and began the intense work of treating the injured. There were many soldiers with head, face, and limb injuries caused by the rioters. Due to the limited time and conditions, she could only perform simple procedures such as stopping the bleeding, cleaning the wounds, and bandaging them. Seeing the soldiers' wounds gushing with blood, she felt immense pain. Gauze, iodine, saline, cotton, and bandages were constantly changing hands. One after another, she completely forgot about the dangerous environment and her own fatigue.

Suddenly, she saw a tall soldier struggling to carry an injured comrade with a leg wound, moving forward with the troops. She quickly ran over and signaled the soldier to put down the injured comrade. She tore open the injured soldier's pants leg and saw a bloody hole gushing with blood. Based on her years of clinical experience, she determined that an artery had been ruptured and that immediate bleeding control was necessary to prevent a serious situation. She quickly took out a thick tourniquet and tightly applied it above the injured leg, and then used cotton pads and bandages to apply pressure to the wound. "That's not enough, he must be sent to the hospital immediately," she said. She then called over a soldier, lifted the injured comrade, and rushed towards the helicopter. Her slight figure appeared so agile and nimble in the darkness. Later, she told me, "I don't know where I got so much strength from. If you had given me Mount Tai at that moment, I might have been able to move it."

Just after sending off the injured soldier, news came that there were injured soldiers in need of treatment in the Xidan direction. Without a moment's rest, she got into the car and headed towards Xidan. At that time, stones were flying through the air in Xidan. Suddenly, a tank driver's right eye was hit by a stone thrown by the rioters, and blood flowed down his face. The tank stopped, and none of the seven soldiers on board knew how to drive. Seeing this, the rioters began to gather around the tank, and the situation became extremely dangerous. At this moment, Wang Jing quickly jumped out of the ambulance, dodging the flying stones as she ran towards the tank. A brick hit her arm, and she felt a cold sweat. Approaching the tank, she leaped onto it, took out the first aid kit, and quickly bandaged the driver's wound. She then used cotton to wipe the blood from the driver's eyes and immediately jumped down from the tank, shouting, "Drive!" The soldiers on the tank, tears in their eyes, watched her disappearing figure as they drove towards the designated area.

I stopped writing and quietly looked at the female military doctor in front of me for a full minute: what kind of passion surged through her slight body? How did she have so much courage and determination?

She still had the same words, "Because I am a soldier, I am a doctor."

### “我是军人，是医生”

　　“我是军人，是医生”
    夏燕
    第一眼见到她，我便认定：是她，那个于６月３日晚随戒严部队到天安门广场清场的唯一女性——某部卫生队少校军医王竞。
    她身材瘦小，却不孱弱，一举手一投足显得干练、潇洒；她不漂亮，也不年轻，眉宇间却常透出一股英气，自信、好强、倔犟全都写在脸上。我暗想，这是个不难读懂的女人。
    “我生性要强，不肯低头示弱。”这次，部队接到执行戒严任务后，领导决定她留守营地。这下可急煞了她，三番五次找领导谈理由、表决心，仍没得到满意的答复，急得她上了火，吃牛黄解毒片也不管用。就在部队临行前几分钟，她最后一次找到领导说：“你们让我去，我要去；你们不让我去，我也要去，反正是去定了。就因为我是女同志？你们有没有想到我首先是军人，是医生！我可以让战士少流血、少牺牲。”话刚落她眼圈也红了。“为了减少麻烦，我可以睡救护车，可以不喝水。”领导见她态度坚决，便答应了她的请求。几天来一直愁眉不展的她终于露出了微笑，扭身回屋，将早已打好的背包扔进救护车里。
    “当时你怕不怕？”“说真的，别看我平时像个小伙子，可这种场面从来没经历过。我们的救护车在夜色中尤其醒目，行进中不时听到暴徒‘砸救护车’的喊声，不时有石块砸车的响声，车玻璃全碎了。头戴钢盔的我顾不得擦汗，一手紧握手枪，一手紧按着急救箱，随时准备出车抢救伤员。”
    ６月４日凌晨１点多钟，救护车随部队开进到天安门西侧，她立即跳下车投入了救治伤员的紧张战斗。被暴徒砸伤头部、面部、四肢的伤员很多，由于时间和条件有限，她只能做简单的止血、清创、包扎处理。看着战士伤口里涌流的鲜血，她心疼极了。止血带、碘酒、盐水、药棉、绷带在她手上高频率地轮换着，一个接着一个，她完全忘记了环境的险峻和身体的疲乏。
    忽然，她看见一个高个子的战士正背着一位腿部受伤的战士吃力地随部队前进。她急忙跑过去，示意这个战士将伤员放下，她撕开伤员裤腿一看，一个血窟窿正向外涌血呢，根据多年的临床经验，断定动脉破裂，如不及时止血，危险性很大。只见她迅速摸出一根特粗止血带，使劲扎在伤腿上部，又用棉垫、绷带在伤口处做了加压包扎。“还不行，必须立即送医院。”她随即叫来一名战士，抬起伤员就朝直升飞机奔去，那瘦小的身影在幕色中显得那样轻捷、矫健。事后她对我说：“我也不知道自己怎么会有那么大劲儿，如果你当时给我一座泰山，也许我也搬得动。”
    刚送走这个伤员，又传来西单方向有伤员需救治的消息，她气没歇一口，抬腿上车朝西单驶去。此时的西单，空中石块横飞。突然，一装甲车司机的右眼被暴徒投来的石块打中了，顿时血流满面，车停了下来，车上７名战士没有１人会开车。见此状，暴徒们渐渐向装甲车围拢，情况万分危急。这时，只见王竞迅速跳下救护车，冒着横飞的石块朝装甲车奔去，一块砖头击中了她的胳膊，疼得她冷汗直冒。接近装甲车，她纵身跃上，取出急救包迅速给司机来了个紧急包扎，又用棉花将司机眼睛处的血迹擦掉，立即跳下车，喊了声“快开”！车上的战士含泪望着她渐渐远去的身影，立即朝指定地域驶去。
    我停下笔，静静地看着眼前这位女军医足有１分钟：她那瘦小的身体里涌动着一股怎样的激情？怎么会有那么大的勇气和毅力？
    她还是那句话，“因为我是军人，是医生。”
