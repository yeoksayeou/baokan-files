Currently, Yugoslavia has entered the holiday and tourism season. In the scenic and pleasant coastal and mountainous areas, tourists are flocking in. However, when you drive through the countryside of Yugoslavia, you can often see groups of young men and women working hard under the scorching sun. Some are widening roads and laying pipes; others are dredging rivers and building dams; still, others are planting trees, afforesting, and cultivating barren mountains. They are young volunteers who have chosen to forgo their holidays to beautify their motherland. According to a leader of the Yugoslav Youth Alliance, this summer, they have established 34 federal-level youth volunteer labor camps across the country, with 490 labor teams and over 21,000 young people participating in voluntary labor, each working for about a month. In addition, each republic, autonomous province, and district also organizes numerous regional voluntary labor activities, with an estimated nearly a million people participating in various forms of voluntary labor throughout the year.

Yugoslavia's youth voluntary labor has a glorious tradition of over 40 years. In the war-torn year of 1942, more than 6,000 young people in Western Bosnia, to solve the food and fuel problems of soldiers and residents, voluntarily organized labor teams to harvest summer crops and cut firewood under the noses of the fascists. Their initiative was affirmed and promoted. From then on, the youth voluntary labor teams, like armed assault teams, built special merits in the liberation war. After the revolution's victory, the youth voluntary labor teams played a significant role in clearing war debris, repairing houses, schools, and hospitals. They built the earliest few important railways after the war with their own hands. In the construction of many large factories, bridges, hydroelectric power stations, New Belgrade, and highways, they all left their sweat. Today, whether in the capital or remote mountain villages, many engineering and architectural projects have commemorative plaques honoring the contributions of youth voluntary labor.

Yugoslav friends emphasize that if the economic achievements of youth voluntary labor can be statistically counted, then its role in carrying forward the spirit of hard work and patriotism, strengthening camaraderie among young people, national unity, and cultivating work habits is immeasurable. To continue this fine tradition, every holiday season, the Youth Alliance organizes voluntary labor in various places, and young people from all walks of life actively sign up. Many foreign young people also come to participate out of admiration.

Not long ago, the reporter visited the voluntary labor camp located in the Pioneer City southwest of Belgrade. This summer, 25 labor teams from all over the country, totaling more than 1,200 young people, will live and work there in three batches. There are also dozens of Hungarian, Czechoslovakian, and West German young people living and working with them, with a total labor value of $800,000. Each labor team is named after a local people's hero or a significant memorial day. To let children receive labor and collective life training from an early age, several couples brought their sons or grandsons to participate in the voluntary labor.

The life of the labor team members is busy but orderly. They get up at 4 a.m., and after morning exercises, flag-raising, and breakfast, they head to the work site. From 6:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m., they work for a full 6 hours, adhering to the standards of professional teams, with each trade having quotas. In the evening, a summary and evaluation meeting is held. The young people, dressed in the blue voluntary labor uniforms issued uniformly, carrying their team flags, and holding portraits of people's heroes named after their team, march into the venue in unison. First, the team leaders report the day's labor achievements, then the camp leader announces the day's evaluation results, and awards the three red banners for labor, hygiene, and social activities to the relevant labor teams. At the end of a month of labor, the most outstanding labor team and individual are evaluated based on the daily records, and the titles of "Shock Brigade" and "Shock Brigade Member" are awarded respectively. Yugoslav youth highly value the honor of their voluntary labor teams. After joining the team, the first thing they do is to learn the team's history, hanging the banners and medals the labor team has received on the flagpole to show their glory. Each team member looks forward to adding new luster to the team's history with their labor.

In addition to labor, the camp also organizes various voluntary study classes for young people in the afternoon, including political lectures, horse riding, photography, dancing, computer use, and vehicle driving. Educational and research institutions in Belgrade also send experts to give special remedial classes for those with poor academic performance. When the moon hangs high in the night sky, many young people hold hands and dance the kolo, singing songs of various nationalities, and the entire labor camp is immersed in the joy of a national gathering. Labor and dance have made young people who were previously strangers become good friends. According to Yugoslav comrades, in every voluntary labor activity, there are always a few pairs of young men and women from different republics who, through understanding, eventually become companions.

As I drove away from the camp, a thought lingered in my mind: Could such a lively youth voluntary labor be promoted and popularized in our country? It is not without benefits for educating and tempering young people, enriching their life content, and enhancing mutual exchanges.

### 发扬艰苦创业传统——记南斯拉夫青年义务劳动

　　发扬艰苦创业传统    
    ——记南斯拉夫青年义务劳动
    本报记者  严正
    目前，南斯拉夫已进入休假旅游季节，在风光旖旎、气候宜人的海滨山区，游客如云。可是，当你驱车在南斯拉夫的原野上，不时可见到一队队小伙子和姑娘正顶着烈日紧张劳动，有的在拓宽公路、铺设管道；有的在疏通河流、筑堤造坝；还有的在植树造林、开垦荒山……他们是自愿放弃休假为美化祖国流汗的青年义务劳动队。据南青盟领导同志介绍，今年夏季，他们在全国各地建立了３４个联邦一级的青年义务劳动营地，４９０个劳动队逾２．１万名青年参加义务劳动，每人劳动时间１个月左右。此外，各共和国、自治省以及各区也组织为数众多的地区性义务劳动，估计全年有近百万人参加各种形式的义务劳动。
    南斯拉夫的青年义务劳动已有４０多年光荣传统。在战火纷飞的１９４２年，西波斯尼亚６０００多名青年为了解决战士和居民的粮食和燃料问题，自动组织义务劳动队，在法西斯鼻子底下抢收夏粮、砍伐林木。他们的创举得到了肯定和推广。从此，青年义务劳动队像持枪的突击队一样，在解放战争中建树了特殊功勋。革命胜利后，青年义务劳动队在清理战争废墟、修复房屋、学校和医院的工作中发挥了巨大作用。他们用双手建造了战后最早的几条重要铁路，在许多大型工厂、桥梁、水力发电站、新贝尔格莱德和高速公路的建设中，都撤下了自己的汗水。如今，无论在首都或偏僻的山村，许多工程建筑上都有表彰青年义务劳动贡献的纪念牌。
    南斯拉夫朋友强调，如果说青年义务劳动的经济成果还能统计的话，那么，它在发扬艰苦创业的爱国主义精神、加强青年间的同志感情、民族团结以及在培养劳动习惯方面所起的作用是难以用数字计算的。为了继续发扬这种优良传统，每年休假时，青盟都在各地举办自愿参加的义务劳动，各行各业的青年积极报名，许多外国青年也慕名前来参加。
    不久前，记者采访了坐落在贝尔格莱德西南少先队城的义务劳动营地。今年夏天，有２５个来自全国各地的劳动队１２００多名青年将分３批在那里生活和劳动，还有数十名匈牙利、捷克斯洛伐克和西德青年与他们一起生活，劳动总价值达８０万美元。每个劳动队都以本地区人民英雄的名字或重大纪念日命名。为让孩子从小就受到劳动和集体生活的锻炼，有好几对夫妇带了自己的儿子或孙子一起参加义务劳动。
    劳动队员的生活紧张而有秩序，他们４点起床，在出操、升旗和早餐后，出发去劳动工地，从６∶３０到１２∶３０整整劳动６个小时，他们按专业队的标准，各工种都有定额。每天傍晚，举行总结评比大会时，青年们身穿统一发给的蓝色义务劳动服，打着队旗，捧着以其名字作为队名的人民英雄遗像，迈着整齐的步伐进入会场。先是各队长汇报一天的劳动成绩，然后由营地领导宣布当天的评比结果，将劳动、卫生和社会活动竞赛的３面优胜流动红旗授给有关劳动队。到一个月劳动结束时，再根据每天的记录评出最优秀劳动队和个人，分别授予“突击队”和“突击队员”的光荣称号。南斯拉夫青年非常珍视自己义务劳动队的荣誉，他们入队后的第一件事，就是学习队史，将劳动队过去得到的锦旗和奖章都挂在队旗杆上，以示光荣，每个队员都盼望以自己的劳动给本队的历史增添新的光辉。
    劳动之外，营地在每天下午还为青年举办各种自愿参加的学习班，有政治讲座、骑马、照相、舞蹈、电子计算机的使用和车辆驾驶等。贝尔格莱德的教育、科研机构还派出专家，专门为学习成绩差的义务补课。当月亮高悬夜空时，许多青年手挽手跳起科罗舞，唱起各民族的歌曲，整个劳动营地沉浸在民族聚会的欢乐中。劳动和歌舞使素不相识的青年成了好朋友。据南斯拉夫同志讲，在每次义务劳动中，总有好几对来自不同共和国的青年男女，通过了解最后结为伴侣。
    当我驱车离开营地时，一个想法萦绕在脑际：像这样生动的青年义务劳动，能不能在我国提倡和推广呢？它对教育和锻炼青年，丰富他们的生活内容，增进彼此间的交往，是不无好处的。
