The Soviet People's Congress Concludes
The Congress Will Promote Democracy and Reform

The first session of the Soviet People's Congress, which began on May 25, concluded today in the Kremlin. In his closing speech, Gorbachev, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, said that in the history of the Soviet Union, there has never been such a frank and direct debate on all issues as there was in this Congress.

The Congress established the new national power organs of the Soviet Union, elected the Supreme Soviet and its Chairman and First Deputy Chairman, and approved the appointment of the head of the government and other personnel.

The Congress also established a Constitutional Commission headed by Gorbachev to draft a new fundamental law of the state.

The representatives today adopted a resolution on the basic guidelines for the internal and external policies of the Soviet Union.

At noon today, Gorbachev made a concluding speech on the discussion of the basic guidelines for the internal and external policies of the Soviet Union. He said that this Congress has led the Soviet Union to a new stage of "developing democracy, openness, and reform." He believes that the Congress has opened up tremendous possibilities for collective exploration of solutions to accelerate the reform and socio-economic development of the Soviet Union. He pointed out that without fundamentally transforming the socialist ownership relations, the state cannot develop firmly and achieve its set goals. He advocates the development of socialist leasehold relations but does not agree with handing everything over to the market. He said: "We should move towards the market along our own path while maintaining planned regulation."

Regarding the national relations issue, he advocates a comprehensive, bold, and at the same time steady and fair approach.

Gorbachev acknowledged the criticism from representatives regarding the slow pace of reform, but he pointed out that reform is a long-term endeavor. He said that one of the notable achievements of the reform is the breaking of the administrative command system, but he disagreed with equating this process with opposition to the state apparatus. He strongly refuted attacks on the Party, emphasizing that if the Party wants to be the vanguard of Soviet society, it must reform itself more quickly.

Some representatives expressed concern about Gorbachev holding both the highest Party and state leadership positions simultaneously. In response, he said that as a Communist Party member, he firmly excludes the possibility of concentrating power excessively in his own hands.

　　苏联人民代表大会闭幕
    大会将促进民主与改革
    新华社莫斯科６月９日电  （记者竺承军）５月２５日开始举行的首届苏联人民代表大会今天在克里姆林宫闭幕。苏联最高苏维埃主席戈尔巴乔夫在致闭幕词时认为，在苏联的历史上还从未有过像这次大会那样对所有问题进行如此坦率和直接的辩论。
    大会组成了苏联新的国家权力机构，选举了苏联最高苏维埃及其主席和第一副主席，批准了政府首脑和其他一系列人选的任命。
    大会还成立以戈尔巴乔夫为首的宪法委员会，来拟定新的国家根本大法。
    代表们今天通过了苏联内外政策基本方针的决议。
    今天中午，戈尔巴乔夫就大会讨论苏联内外政策基本方针情况作了总结发言。他说，这次大会把苏联引向到“发展民主、公开性和改革的新阶段”。他认为大会为集体探索解决加快苏联改革和社会、经济发展问题开辟了巨大的可能。他指出，如果不对社会主义所有制关系实行根本变革，国家就不能坚定地向前发展并达到既定目标。他主张发展社会主义租赁关系，但不赞成将一切都交给市场。他说：“应当沿着我们自己的道路走向市场，同时保持计划调节”。
    对于民族关系问题，他主张综合地、全面地、勇敢地同时应当稳重地、公正地加以处理。
    戈尔巴乔夫表示接受代表们提出的关于改革缓慢的批评，同时他指出，改革是相当长时间的事业。他说，改革的一个显著成果是冲破了行政命令体制，但他不同意将这一过程与反对国家机器混为一谈。他对有人攻击党作了坚决驳斥，同时强调，党如果想要成为苏联社会的先锋队，它必须更快地进行自身改革。
    有些代表对戈尔巴乔夫同时担任党和国家最高领导职务表示担心。对此他回答说，作为一个共产党员，他坚决排除将权力过分集中于自己的可能性。
