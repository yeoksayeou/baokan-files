I am a cadre in a government agency, and my wife also works in an agency. Our combined monthly salary, along with laundry fees and price subsidies, adds up to over two hundred yuan. With a child and a nanny, the difficulty of our life can be imagined.

Income doesn't go up, expenses don't go down, the result is inevitably a "budget deficit." In my free time, I don't like to go shopping, especially not with my wife and child. Facing those countless goods, the child's eager gaze, and my wife's inquiring eyes, I can't take it. A man of seven feet, thirty years old, feels truly ashamed!

Some say that cadres in government agencies are "a cup of tea, a cigarette, a newspaper, and half a day of leisure." Such cadres do exist, but to use this as proof that government agency cadres have low labor intensity and deserve low pay is not necessarily correct. Not to mention the theory that complex labor equals simple labor multiplied by many, but in the six years I have been in the agency, I have never had a leisurely day. Instead, I often work overtime, but I don't get any extra pay.

You can't stand being poor? You can quit, and some people have. Are you envious? A bit, but I don't want to follow suit. Besides, I've been doing this job for so many years, I can't just drop it and not do it anymore.

Are there ways to "generate income"? There are "doors," and they are wide open. But not everyone is willing to take this path. Agencies have some power, like some cadres who engage in "power-for-money" exchanges, without much effort, money comes in. But this requires "changing one's mindset," abandoning principles, and ignoring the law. To be honest, most people don't have the "courage" and guts for this. Working late into the night, inventing reasons to ask parents for "sponsorship," is also a way to "generate income," but it's a bit bitter. What about those who can't climb the ladder and can't get "sponsorship"? I am really worried for them.

Relying on parents will eventually stop, and climbing the ladder is not easy. I often ask myself, how long can I hold on? Nowadays, it's fashionable to have a "sense of crisis," and our young cadres in government agencies are worried about how to get by in the future.

### 机关干部的“忧患”

　　机关干部的“忧患”
    姚峰
    我是一名机关干部，妻子也在机关工作。两人每月工资加上洗理费、物价补贴零七碎八满打满算二百多元。加上一个孩子、一个保姆，生活之难可想而知。
    收入上不去，支出压不下来，其结果必然是“财政赤字”。闲暇时，我不愿逛商店，尤其不愿和妻儿一起逛商店。面对那琳琅满目的商品，孩子那孜孜以求的目光，妻子探询的眼神，我受不了。七尺男儿、三十岁的汉，实在惭愧！
    有人说机关干部是“一杯茶，一支烟，一张报纸混半天”。这种干部不能说没有，但以此为由证明机关干部劳动强度低，收入少点理所当然，就不一定对了。且不说复杂劳动等于简单劳动倍加的理论，反正笔者在机关六年中，还没有过过清闲的日子，倒是经常加班加点，却没有多得分文。
    嫌穷你不会跳槽？这当然可以，而且也有人跳了。眼热吗？有点，效仿吗？不想。再者，干这差使这么多年了，甩下不干，还有些舍不得。
    有没有“创收”的门路？“门”是有的，而且洞开着。但不一定人人愿走这条路。机关多少有点权，像某些干部一样搞“权钱交易”，不费多少力，钱就来了。但这需要“转变观念”，放弃原则，无视法律。说真的，一般人还没有这个“勇气”和胆量。半夜三更爬格子，巧立名目拉父母“赞助”，也是“创收”办法，只是有些苦涩。还有那些爬不起格子，搞不到“赞助”的人怎么活？我真有些替他们担忧。
    依靠父母终有止日，爬格子也并非易事。我常问自己，还能坚持多久？现在时兴“忧患”意识，我们青年机关干部眼下的忧患是：往下怎么过？
