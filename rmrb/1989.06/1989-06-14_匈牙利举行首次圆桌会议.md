　　匈牙利举行首次圆桌会议
    新华社布达佩斯６月１３日电  有匈牙利社会主义工人党和匈牙利各反对派组织以及各社会组织参加的３方圆桌会议，１３日下午举行了首次会议。
    举行圆桌会议是匈政治生活中的一件大事，它将讨论实现民主政治过渡和克服社会、经济危机的战略任务等问题。主持会议的国民议会议长絮勒什强调，如果谈判各方找到共同语言，将会开创一个新时期。
    据匈通社１３日报道，３方代表都在会议上发表了意向性讲话。匈党总书记格罗斯说，匈党将从各个方面摒弃斯大林模式的残余，并愿同其他政治力量一道，建设一个能够体现人民意志的民主和社会主义的法治国家。独立法律学家论坛领导人科尼奥·伊姆雷代表各反对派组织表示，他们参加圆桌会议不是为了分享政权，而是要真正让匈公民来决定，在明年大选期间应由哪一种政治力量来执政。各社会组织代表的发言主要是强调维护各自的利益。
    会议决定，下次会议于６月２１日举行，届时将讨论会议的议题等有关具体问题。
