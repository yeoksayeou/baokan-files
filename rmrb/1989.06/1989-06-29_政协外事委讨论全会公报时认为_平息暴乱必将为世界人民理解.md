Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 29th.

The Foreign Affairs Committee of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) has held meetings over the past few days to study and discuss the communiqué of the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the important speech by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. The members felt greatly inspired and their confidence was boosted. They expressed their firm support.

The committee members focused their discussion on the international background and international reactions to the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot that occurred in Beijing. They applauded the growing number of foreign friends who understand, sympathize with, and support China's suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot. They were outraged by the actions of some Western countries that, under the pretext of "democracy," "freedom," and "human rights," created public opinion, spread rumors, and slandered China, exerted pressure, and rudely interfered in China's internal affairs. They even interfered with China's legal suppression of criminals and terrorists who committed serious crimes, which is extremely infuriating.

The committee members stated that China's policy of reform and opening up will not change, and China's independent and peaceful foreign policy will not change either. We will continue to adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence and develop relations with all countries. We will, as always, strengthen our ties and cooperation with all friendly countries, organizations, and individuals, and make unremitting efforts together to maintain world peace. Everyone firmly believes that China's just struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary riot will be further understood by the people of the world. Those who rudely interfere in China's internal affairs are shortsighted and extremely foolish.

　　政协外事委讨论全会公报时认为     
    平息暴乱必将为世界人民理解
    据新华社北京６月２９日电  全国政协外事委员会连日来召开会议，认真学习和讨论了中国共产党十三届四中全会公报和邓小平同志的重要讲话。感到深受鼓舞，信心倍增，表示坚决拥护。
    委员们着重讨论了最近发生在北京的动乱和反革命暴乱的国际背景和国际上的反应。对越来越多的外国朋友理解、同情和支持我国平息反革命暴乱表示赞赏；对西方一些国家以所谓“民主”、“自由”和“人权”为借口，制造舆论，造谣污蔑，施加压力，粗暴地干涉中国内政，甚至对我国依法镇压犯有严重罪行的暴徒和恐怖分子横加干涉，感到极大愤慨。
    委员们表示，中国的改革开放政策不会改变，中国独立自主的和平外交政策也不会改变。我们继续坚持在和平共处五项原则基础上同一切国家发展关系。我们将一如既往地加强同一切友好国家、友好组织和友好人士的联系与合作，共同为维护世界和平进行不懈的努力。大家坚信，我国平息反革命暴乱的正义斗争必将得到世界人民的进一步理解。那些粗暴干涉中国内政的人们是目光短浅和非常愚蠢的。
