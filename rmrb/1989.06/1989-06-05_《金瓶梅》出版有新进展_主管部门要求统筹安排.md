Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 4th.

The publication of "Jin Ping Mei," the first long novel in vernacular Chinese depicting social life, has made new progress: three versions with the most research value have been completed, and abridged editions, sequels, and research materials have also been published successively.

Published in the 45th year of the Ming Dynasty's Wanli reign (1617 AD), "Jin Ping Mei" received mixed reviews. Some praised it for its vivid language and rich literary style, while others condemned it as obscene and harmful to morality. Throughout the dynasties, it was considered the "most obscene book in the world" and was banned from publication.

However, "Jin Ping Mei" miraculously survived and has now been translated into multiple languages, including English, French, German, Japanese, and Italian. Many sinologists regard it as a masterpiece of classical realism.

Currently, there are many versions of "Jin Ping Mei" both domestically and internationally. Scholars generally agree that the Wanli version, the Chongzhen version, and the Qing Dynasty's Kangxi version annotated by Zhang Zhipu are the most valuable for research.

In the 1950s, the People's Literature Publishing House, under the name of the Ancient Books Publishing House, reprinted the Ming Dynasty's Wanli version of "Jin Ping Mei." Recently, Beijing University Press reprinted a relatively complete version of the Chongzhen edition titled "Newly Engraved Illustrated and Annotated Jin Ping Mei." Shandong's Qilu Publishing House is currently hurriedly typesetting a collated and annotated version of the Chongzhen edition, which will be available soon. In addition to publishing the complete versions of "Jin Ping Mei," the People's Literature Publishing House and Qilu Publishing House have each published abridged editions of "Jin Ping Mei" and annotated versions by Zhang Zhipu. Several publishers have also selected and published sequels to "Jin Ping Mei," as well as dozens of research monographs and materials.

According to a responsible comrade from the Book Bureau of the Press and Publication Administration, the domestic handling and publication of "Jin Ping Mei" have always been approached with seriousness and caution. On one hand, important versions that are recognized by the academic community and have research value should be systematically and step-by-step compiled and published; on the other hand, necessary controls should be imposed on the distribution scope to avoid unnecessary negative impacts on the physical and mental health of young people.

Surrounding the publication of this book, a hotspot has already formed. Insightful individuals in the publishing industry remind people: although "Jin Ping Mei" holds an important position in literary history, its thoughts and art are a mix of good and bad, especially with its explicit sexual descriptions, so it should not be widely circulated, and it should not be treated as a "money tree."

Given that the three most valuable versions of "Jin Ping Mei" for research have been completed, the Press and Publication Administration believes that other versions do not need to be rushed for publication in the near future; considering that "Jin Ping Mei" does not need to be popularized, abridged editions, rewritten versions, comic books, etc., related to this book generally do not need to be published.

It is reported that the "Jin Ping Mei Stories" published by the Writers Publishing House is not suitable for young people to read and has been severely criticized and reprimanded by the education authorities.

### 《金瓶梅》出版有新进展  主管部门要求统筹安排

　　《金瓶梅》出版有新进展
    主管部门要求统筹安排
    新华社北京６月４日电  （记者李光茹）中国文学史上第一部长篇白话世情小说《金瓶梅》的出版有了新进展：三个最具研究价值的原刊本已出齐，节本、续书及研究资料也相继面世。
    明万历４５年（公元１６１７年），《金瓶梅词话》刊行后，褒贬不一。有的夸奖它“云霞满纸”，文彩灿然，有的诅咒它是“坏人心术”的秽亵文字。历代王朝将其视为“天下第一淫书”，不准出版。
    然而，《金瓶梅》却奇迹般地保留下来，如今已被译成英、法、德、日、意等多种文字，许多汉学家推崇它为“古典现实主义杰作”。
    目前中外所藏的《金瓶梅》版本很多，学界公认明万历本、崇祯本、清康熙张竹坡批评本最具研究价值。
    ５０年代，人民文学出版社以古籍刊行社名义影印出版了明代万历本《金瓶梅词话》。北京大学出版社新近影印了现存崇祯本中较为完善的版本《新刻绣像批评金瓶梅》。山东齐鲁书社正在加紧排印《金瓶梅》崇祯本校勘足本，不久即可见书。除了出版《金瓶梅》足本外，人民文学出版社和齐鲁书社分别于前几年出版了《金瓶梅词话》校点删节本、《金瓶梅》张竹坡批评本的删节本。一些出版社经过筛选，还出版了《金瓶梅》续书，以及几十种有关《金瓶梅》的研究著作和研究资料等。
    据新闻出版署图书司负责同志介绍，国内对《金瓶梅》的整理出版一直持严肃、审慎态度。一方面，对学术界公认的、确有研究价值的重要版本，应该有计划、有步骤地整理出版；同时，又要对发行范围加以必要的控制，以免对青少年的身心健康带来不必要的影响。
    围绕着这部书的出版，目前已形成一个热点。出版界有识之士提醒人们注意：《金瓶梅》虽在文学史上占有重要地位，但其思想与艺术，良芜并陈，特别是存在露骨的性描写，所以不宜广泛印行，更不能把它当“摇钱树”。
    鉴于《金瓶梅》三种最具研究价值的版本已出齐，新闻出版署认为：其它版本在今后一个时期内，不必急于出版；考虑到《金瓶梅》没有普及的必要，有关此书的缩写本、改写本、连环画等一般不必出版。
    据悉：作家出版社出版的《金瓶梅故事》不宜青少年阅读，受到教育部门的严厉批评和责难。
