Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang, June 21st — A spy sent by the Taiwan National Defense Bureau's Military Intelligence Bureau, Ou Zongyou, was captured by mainland public security authorities early this morning in Guiyang.

During periods of turmoil or riots in some parts of the mainland, Ou Zongyou received orders from Taiwanese spy agencies to "participate in student movements, align with the internal situation, and secretly incite student unrest," and to "fight for freedom and human rights." He spread malicious rumors such as "This time, the Communist Party is really going to collapse," inciting people's minds, and went to great lengths to collect internal newspapers and magazines with reports of turmoil for overseas entities, and took photographs of marches, sit-ins, and speeches.

Ou Zongyou also repeatedly expressed in writing and verbally to the Nationalist Party's Military Intelligence Bureau: "I vow to contribute to ending the Communist Party's authoritarian rule."

The 46-year-old Ou Zongyou is a cultural individual entrepreneur in Guiyang who runs an art studio. Due to his obsession with wealth and his infatuation with the bourgeois lifestyle, in November 1984, during a visit to Hong Kong to see relatives, he was turned and sent back to Guiyang by Taiwanese spy agencies. His main task was to infiltrate long-term, develop organizations, and provide and transmit intelligence to enemy spy agencies. Later, he went to Hong Kong several times to receive spy training and secretly met with Taiwanese spies in Hong Kong, Guangzhou, Shenzhen, Guilin, and other places to transmit economic, political, and personnel intelligence, receive tasks and operational funds, and develop organizational members.

When the public security authorities cracked this case, they pointed out that although Ou Zongyou was good at disguising himself, deceiving the public to obtain social positions such as the chairman of the Zhongshan West Road Individual Laborers' Association in Guiyang, and acting very secretly, his activities had long been noticed and reported by the public, and he ultimately could not escape the law.

　　台湾一派遣特务昨晨在贵阳落网
    新华社贵阳６月２１日电（记者周晓农、陈云珍）长期潜伏在贵阳的台湾国防部军事情报局派遣特务欧宗佑，今天凌晨被大陆公安机关抓获。
    在大陆一些地方发生动乱或暴乱期间，欧宗佑接受台湾特务机关“从事学运，配合区内形势，秘密策动学潮”，“争取自由，争取人权”的指令，散布“这次共产党真要垮台了”的恶毒语言，蛊惑人心，并千方百计为境外收集我刊有动乱情况的内部报刊资料，拍摄游行、静坐、演讲的照片。
    欧宗佑还向国民党军事情报局多次书面和口头表示：“誓为结束共产党的专制统治贡献一份力量”。
    现年４６岁的欧宗佑，是贵阳市以开办画室为业的文化个体户。由于醉心财物，迷恋资产阶级生活方式，１９８４年１１月他去香港探亲期间，即被台湾特务机关策反并派遣回贵阳，其主要任务是长期潜伏，发展组织，为敌特机关提供、传递情报。之后，他又数次专程赴香港接受特务训练，并在香港及广州、深圳、桂林等地多次与台湾派遣特务秘密接头，传递经济、政治及人事资料情报，接受任务和活动经费，还发展了组织成员。
    公安机关在破获此案时指出，尽管欧宗佑善于伪装，骗取了贵阳市中山西路个体劳动者协会主任等社会职务，行动十分诡秘，但其活动早已被群众发觉举报，终究难逃法网。
