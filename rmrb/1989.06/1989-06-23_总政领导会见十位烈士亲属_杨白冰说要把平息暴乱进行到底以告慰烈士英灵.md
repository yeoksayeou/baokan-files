The leaders of the General Political Department met with ten families of martyrs who sacrificed their lives in quelling the counter-revolutionary riot. Yang Baibing said that the suppression of the riot must be carried through to the end to console the spirits of the martyrs.

New China News Agency, Beijing, June 22 — This morning, Yang Baibing, the Director of the General Political Department, along with Deputy Directors Guo Linxiang, Zhou Keyu, and Zhou Wenyuan, met with 30 family members of 10 martyrs who had already arrived in Beijing. These martyrs had sacrificed their lives in quelling the counter-revolutionary riot. The leaders expressed heartfelt condolences and deep sorrow for the martyrs' sacrifices.

The 10 martyrs are: Liu Guogeng, Cui Guozheng, Wang Qifu, Wang Jinwei, Li Qiang, Du Huaiqing, Wang Xiaobing, Ma Guoxuan, Li Dongguo, and Xu Rujun.

Yang Baibing first thanked the parents of the martyrs for raising such outstanding sons and thanked the hometowns of the martyrs for providing the army with such excellent soldiers. He praised the martyrs for defending socialist China, defending the capital of the Republic, and defending the peace and happiness of countless families. Their sacrifices were noble and weighty. They were truly the good sons of the Party and the people, exemplary soldiers of the new era, and loyal guardians of the Republic. The Party, the people, and the Republic will never forget their contributions, which will be forever recorded in history.

Yang Baibing said that this struggle to quell the counter-revolutionary riot was a special battle. The challenges faced by the troops were even more severe than those on the battlefield. Why did our officers and soldiers get beaten? Why were your relatives brutally killed? It was not because they lacked the ability to defend themselves. Our officers and soldiers had weapons and could have protected themselves. However, because many uninformed masses and a few troublemakers were mixed together, our officers and soldiers, to avoid harming the masses, endured humiliation and heavy burdens, ultimately sacrificing their precious lives. Their heroic sacrifices not only exposed the brutality of a few rioters but also educated the broad masses. It also showed that our army is truly the people's army, genuinely dedicated to protecting the broad masses. Chairman Deng of the Military Commission highly praised the performance of the People's Liberation Army in this incident. The Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission are all satisfied. The broad masses of the people enthusiastically support our army and are deeply grateful to the martyrs who sacrificed themselves for the people's interests. Yang Baibing said that the Party and the state attach great importance to doing a good job in the aftermath of the martyrs. The leaders of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission gave important instructions when they met with the families of the martyrs who arrived in Beijing earlier. The General Political Department has also conducted serious research and decided to work with relevant provinces and cities to arrange the lives of the martyrs' families. Yang Baibing said that the struggle to quell the counter-revolutionary riot has achieved significant victories. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, we will press on to the end, continuing to advance our reform and construction, to console the spirits of the fallen martyrs.

The families of the martyrs expressed in their speeches that their relatives had sacrificed themselves to defend the Party Central Committee, defend the capital, and defend the People's Republic. They died gloriously. As family members, they were deeply saddened but also felt very proud. They strongly condemned the counter-revolutionary rioters who attempted to overthrow the People's Republic and the socialist system, and who harmed the people's soldiers. They hoped that the Party Central Committee would completely eliminate this small group of rioters and not show any mercy. They expressed deep gratitude to the Party, the government, and the military for their care and requested that the leaders of the General Political Department convey their heartfelt greetings to Chairman Deng of the Military Commission, wishing him good health and longevity. During the meeting, the sisters of martyrs Wang Qifu and Xu Rujun both expressed their desire to enlist in the military, take up their brothers' guns, and contribute to defending the motherland. The leaders of the units where the two martyrs served agreed on the spot to accept them.

The leaders of the General Political Department presented the families of the martyrs with a booklet of Deng Xiaoping and condolence gifts. They also handed over part of the donations from various sectors of society to the martial law troops and the families of the martyrs, and took a group photo with them.

Those present included leaders of the martial law troops, Liu Zhenhua and Cao Quansheng, and relevant officials from the provinces and cities where the martyrs' hometowns are located.

　　总政领导会见十位烈士亲属    
    杨白冰说要把平息暴乱进行到底以告慰烈士英灵
    新华社北京６月２２日电  今天上午，总政治部主任杨白冰，副主任郭林祥、周克玉、周文元，会见了在平息反革命暴乱中牺牲的现已到京的１０位烈士的３０位亲属，向他们表示亲切的慰问，对烈士的牺牲表示沉痛的哀悼。
    这１０位烈士是：刘国庚、崔国政、王其富、王锦伟、李强、杜怀庆、王晓兵、马国选、李栋国、徐如军。
    杨白冰首先感谢烈士的父母为人民养育了这样的好儿子，感谢烈士的家乡为军队输送了这样的好战士。他赞扬烈士们为捍卫社会主义祖国而死，为捍卫共和国的首都而死，为捍卫千家万户的安宁和幸福而死，死得其所，重于泰山。他们不愧为党和人民的好儿子，不愧为新时期雷锋式的好战士，不愧为共和国的忠诚卫士。对在这场斗争中牺牲的烈士，亲人们不会忘记他们，党和人民不会忘记他们，共和国不会忘记他们，人民解放军全体干部战士不会忘记他们，他们的功绩将永存史册。
    杨白冰说，这次平息反革命暴乱的斗争是一场特殊的战斗，部队经受的考验比在战场上还要严峻。我们的干部战士为什么挨打，你们的亲人为什么惨遭杀害，不是因为他们没有自卫能力，干部战士手中都有武器，完全能够保护自己。只是因为许多不明真相的群众和一小撮坏人混杂在一起，我们的干部战士为了不误伤群众，因此一让再让，忍辱负重，直至牺牲自己宝贵的生命。他们的壮烈牺牲，不仅揭露了一小撮暴徒的凶残，教育了广大人民群众，同时也表明了我们这支军队真正是人民的子弟兵，是真心实意保护广大人民群众的。军委邓主席对解放军这次的表现给予了很高评价，党中央、国务院、中央军委都很满意。广大人民对我们这支军队表示热情拥戴，对为人民利益而牺牲的烈士们无比感激。杨白冰说，党和国家对做好烈士的善后工作非常重视，党中央、国务院、中央军委的领导同志在会见先期到京的烈士亲属时，专门作了重要指示，我们总政治部也作了认真研究，决心同有关省、市一起，安排好烈士亲属的生活。杨白冰说，这次平息反革命暴乱的斗争已经取得重大胜利。我们要在党中央、国务院、中央军委的领导下，乘胜前进，把这场斗争进行到底，把我们的改革和建设事业继续推向前进，以告慰死难烈士的英灵。
    烈士的亲属们在发言中表示，自己的亲人是为保卫党中央、保卫首都、保卫人民共和国而牺牲的，他们死得光荣。作为亲属，一方面十分悲痛，同时又感到非常自豪。他们对反革命暴徒妄图推翻人民共和国，推翻社会主义制度，残害人民子弟兵的罪行表示极大的愤怒，希望党中央对这一小撮暴徒要除恶务尽，绝不能手软。他们对党、政府和军队的关怀表示深切感谢，并请总政领导转达对军委邓主席的衷心问候，希望他保重身体，健康长寿。在会见过程中，烈士王其富和徐如军的妹妹都表示要参军入伍，接过哥哥的枪，为保卫祖国贡献力量，两位烈士生前所在部队的领导当场表示同意接受。
    总政领导向烈士亲属赠送了《邓小平画册》和慰问品，还转交了社会各界给戒严部队和烈士亲属的部分捐款，并同他们一起合影留念。
    参加会见的有戒严部队领导同志刘振华、曹芃生，烈士家乡的省市有关负责同志。
