Canadians often describe themselves as “one country, two languages, three parties, and multicultural.” Like the United States, Canada is a country of immigrants, but while the U.S. emphasizes the fusion of different cultures, it is often referred to as a “melting pot.” Canada, on the other hand, advocates for the independent coexistence of multiple cultures, respecting and encouraging the flourishing of various cultural traditions.

Canada's vast northwestern region is home to approximately 40,000 Inuit (the term “Eskimo” means “eaters of raw meat” and is now generally replaced by “Inuit,” meaning “true people”) and a small number of Indigenous peoples. This area is isolated, with most regions only accessible by water or air. To change the semi-isolated status of the Inuit, the Canadian federal government launched the “Inukshuk” satellite television broadcasting experiment in the late 1970s. The goal was to connect the scattered Inuit settlements via satellite television and integrate them with the outside world.

“Inukshuk” is an Inuit term meaning “human-shaped stone pile,” a marker used by Inuit hunters to convey information. This experiment has been successful, and even the most remote Inuit families can now watch the bloodshed in Beirut, wars in Central America, the enduring television series “Dallas,” and performances by the hottest rock stars on their TV screens.

However, as Inuit Television Company manager Kubotaña noted, “There is nothing of our own on the screen. When we think about our children having watched 30,000 hours of television by the time they are 18, we can’t help but worry about the future of Inuit traditional culture.” Under the urging of forward-thinking individuals, in January 1982, the Canadian federal government agreed to and funded the establishment of the Inuit Television Company. The company adopted “Inukshuk” as its logo (see illustration). This choice is ingenious, embodying both the cultural characteristics of the Inuit and symbolizing the company’s broadcasting function.

The Inuit Television Company is a non-profit organization funded by the federal government. Its mission is to preserve, disseminate, and develop Inuit traditional culture. Of the more than 50 employees, over 85% are Inuit. The company’s five program production and broadcasting centers air over five hours of Inuit-language programs each week. These programs cover an area of nearly 3.3 million square kilometers in the Northwest Territories, Labrador Peninsula, and northern Quebec, spanning four time zones and constituting about one-third of Canada’s territory. The content is also Inuit-focused, featuring news that the Inuit care about, special programs showcasing their traditional culture, and television dramas that embody Inuit ethical values such as respect for the elderly, concern for others, and resilience.

After several years of hard work, the Inuit Television Company has promoted the Inuit’s sense of participation and cultural awakening. Its next goal is to help Inuit and their next generation correctly understand their surroundings and the world through the television screen.

    爱斯基摩电视公司

    加拿大人常常说他们是“一个国家、两种语言、三个政党、多元文化”。同样是移民国家，美国强调不同文化的融合，因此被称为“民族熔炉”，而加拿大则提倡多元文化的独立和并存，尊重并鼓励各种文化的繁荣发展。
    加拿大广袤的西北地区仅仅居住着大约四万因纽特人
  （爱斯基摩人意为“吃生肉的人”，现普遍改称因纽特人，意为“真正的人”）和少数印地安人。那里交通闭塞，与世隔绝，大部分地区只能靠水路和飞机与外界保持联系。为了改变因纽特人这种半封闭的状态，加拿大联邦政府于70年代末在北部地区进行了名为“伊努克沙克”的卫星电视转播实验，试图通过卫星电视把各个隔离分散的因纽特人居住点联系起来，并使他们与外部世界结为一体。
    “伊努克沙克”为爱斯基摩语，意思是人形石堆，是因纽特猎人用砾石堆筑用以传达信息的标志。现在这项试验已经取得了成功，即使是居住在最偏远地区的因纽特人家庭，也能在电视屏幕上目睹贝鲁特的流血场面、中美洲的战争、长映不衰的电视剧《达拉斯》以及最红的摇滚歌星的表演。
    但是，正如爱斯基摩电视公司经理库博塔娜女士指出的：“从屏幕上却看不到我们自己的东西。当想到我们的孩子在长到18岁时已经看了3万个小时的电视节目时，就不由地为因纽特人传统文化的未来担忧。”在有识之士的敦促下，1982年1月，加拿大联邦政府同意并资助成立了爱斯基摩电视公司。公司采用“伊努克沙克”作为自己的台标（见图）。这个选择可谓独具匠心，既体现了因纽特人的文化特征，又象征着公司的传播功能。
    爱斯基摩电视公司是非赢利性组织，资金来源由联邦政府提供。公司的宗旨是保存、传播和发展因纽特人的传统文化。在50多名公司员工中，85％以上是因纽特人。公司的5个节目制作播出中心，每周播出5个多小时的爱斯基摩语节目。这些节目覆盖了西北地区、拉布拉多半岛、北魁北克近330万平方公里的土地，横跨4个时区，相当于加拿大国土的1／3。节目内容也是爱斯基摩化的，既有因纽特人关注的热门新闻，又有展示他们传统文化的专题节目，还有洋溢着尊敬老人、关心他人、坚韧不拔这类爱斯基摩伦理美德的电视剧。
    经过几年的艰苦创业，爱斯基摩电视公司促进了因纽特人的参与意识和文化上的觉醒。它的下一个目标是，使因纽特人和他们的下一代通过电视屏幕去正确认识他们周围的环境以及整个世界。
