In the agricultural market, several children around ten years old are helping their father manage the vegetable stall. Their young voices calling out to sell the vegetables make one's heart ache.

The Chinese mainland has been liberated for nearly forty years, yet among those who have become fathers, there is still a significant number of illiterate individuals. If these "fathers" were to stop here, it would be one thing, but unfortunately, they are quietly creating a new generation of illiterates. Thinking about the future of the country's modernization and looking at the actions of these fathers, one cannot help but worry.

Lu Xun once divided fathers into two types: one is the "father of children," and the other is the "father of man." He said the first type "only knows how to give birth, not how to educate... The second type gives birth to children and then thinks about how to educate them so that the children, when they grow up, can become complete individuals." In old China, due to the country's backwardness and people's poverty, it was natural that there were more "fathers of children" who only cared about giving birth and not about education. Therefore, although China had the reputation of having a large population, the quality of its people was indeed not high. Now, the motherland is politically strong and economically much more prosperous than before, but "fathers of children" have reappeared in large numbers, which is obviously out of step with the times. The emergence of this phenomenon is not entirely due to economic reasons; even wealthy individual businessmen have children who go to "hawk their wares." The main reason is still the lack of education, which limits their vision, making them only see the immediate benefits while being completely unaware of the importance of their children's success and the country's development. The influence of these "fathers who raise but do not educate" on the quality of the population may last for several generations. Lu Xun's description of such fathers as "machines for making children" is not at all an exaggeration.

The country needs talent, and success requires education. Society calls out to every parent: please be the "father of man"!

    为“人”之父
    魏志军
    在农贸市场上，几个十来岁的孩子替父亲守菜摊，稚嫩的叫卖声，听来让人心中一阵酸楚。
    中国大陆已解放快四十年了，然而在当了父亲的人们中仍有一支数量不小的文盲大军，如果这些“父亲”自己到此为止也就罢了，岂料他们又在悄悄制造下一代的文盲队伍，想想国家四化发展的前景，再看看这些做父亲的做法，能不令人担心？
    鲁迅先生曾把当父亲的分成两类，一类叫孩子之父，一类叫“人”之父，他说第一种“只会生，不会教，……第二种是生了孩子还要想怎样教育，才能使生下来的孩子，将来成一个完全的人。”旧中国由于国家落后，人们生活贫困，自然是只管生孩子不管教育的“孩子之父”多，因此虽落了个“人口众多”的虚名，但人口素质委实不高。如今祖国政治上强盛，经济上也比过去繁荣得多，但“孩子之父”又大量出现，显然是和时代不合拍的。这种现象的产生倒不完全是经济原因，腰缠万贯的个体户不也有让孩子去“摆摊”的么？主要还是因为没文化而限制了他们的视野，只看眼前那点儿利益，而对孩子的成才、国家的发展一点儿也意识不到。这些“养不教”的父亲对人口素质的影响可能会波及几代人，鲁迅先生把这种父亲称为“制造孩子的家伙”，我以为一点儿也不过分。
    国家需要人才，成才需要教育。社会向每一位做父母的发出声声呼唤：请你为“人”之父！
