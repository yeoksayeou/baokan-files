The Ministry of Justice today convened a meeting of some capital lawyers to discuss the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech. The participants said that as legal workers in socialist society, after experiencing this turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot, studying Comrade Xiaoping's speech has left a deep impression. They have gained a deeper understanding of our constitution.

Vice President of the All-China Lawyers Association Wang Ruqi said that this turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot, instigated by a small number of people, is a criminal act aimed at overthrowing the Party and socialism.

Vice President of the All-China Lawyers Association and First-Class Lawyer Li Wenjie believes that we should mobilize all positive factors, unite all forces that can be united, and focus on the basic line of "one center, two basic points." We should follow the instructions of Comrade Xiaoping, who advocates for both economic development and legal construction, to do our work well.

Lawyers Gu Xiancheng and Ren Guojin also spoke.

Minister of Justice Cai Cheng said at the end of the meeting that Comrade Xiaoping is the chief architect of China's reform and opening up and a strong advocate and supporter of the restoration of the lawyer system. We should use the spirit of Comrade Xiaoping's speech to strengthen the construction of democracy and the legal system and do our work well.
