When will China's ice hockey emerge from its slump? This was the main topic of discussion among experts during the observation of the National Ice Hockey A-League in Harbin in late May.

It is well known that China's ice hockey has long been at the middle to lower level in the world. In recent years, it has faced unprecedented severe challenges. After the dissolution of teams such as the People's Liberation Army, the Railway Locomotive Factory Sports Association, and the Mudanjiang team, some other teams are also considering "retiring" from the sport. The second National Winter Youth Games ice hockey tournament, held this spring in Jilin to assess China's ice hockey reserves, had only six teams participating. The national team, representing China's highest level of ice hockey, has been stuck between the B and C groups in the world rankings. This year, they only managed to secure the third place in the C group tournament, failing to advance.

Ice hockey officials say that ice hockey is a high-cost, low-return sport (referring to the single gold medal). For sports departments at various levels with tight budgets, it is a heavy burden. Last year, a certain team spent over 20,000 yuan on hockey sticks alone in half a year of training. Generally, municipal sports commissions cannot afford such expenses. Coupled with the recent adjustment of the layout by the State Sports Commission, which excluded ice hockey from the "key" projects, it has been somewhat neglected. Some provinces and cities have easily added ice hockey to the "retirement" list when adjusting their local project layouts.

As the shadow of uncertainty over China's ice hockey future deepens, recently, the general manager of the Jixi Steel Window Factory invested tens of thousands of yuan to host the highly publicized National Meizhou Cup Women's Ice Hockey Invitational Tournament in Harbin. Following this, the State Sports Commission held the first National Women's Ice Hockey Championship in Harbin. Eight teams from Heilongjiang and Jilin provinces participated in these two tournaments. China's women's ice hockey has only been in existence for about four or five years, and people are concerned about its position in the international ice hockey arena.

Last year, the Harbin women's ice hockey team visited Japan and won all four matches with a significant margin. The Japanese teams that participated were the strongest in their domestic league. In the 1987 international invitational tournament held in Canada, the only Asian team, Japan, secured the fifth place. Experts infer from this that China's women's ice hockey level is roughly in the middle to upper range in the world.

Some entrepreneurs are quite interested in this. Currently, out of the eight women's ice hockey teams nationwide, half are sponsored by enterprises, namely: the Jixi Steel Window Factory team, the Harbin Aircraft Manufacturing Company team, the Huolin Rubber Factory team, and the Jilin Chemical Industry Company Second Middle School team.

There is news that the International Ice Hockey Federation has decided to hold the first World Women's Ice Hockey Championship in 1990. China is preparing to gather its best players to form a national training team, aiming to compete with the world's top teams. If they can achieve good results, then ice hockey, which has always been a domain of men, will become another sport in China's competitive athletics where women excel and men lag behind.

　　夏日泛说冰球事
    梁学增
    我国冰球运动何时走出低谷？这是行家们５月底在哈尔滨市观看全国冰球甲级联赛期间的主要话题。
    众所周知，我国冰球运动一直处于世界中下游水平。近几年更遇到了前所未有的严重挑战。继解放军、火车头体协和牡丹江等队解散之后，又有些队在酝酿“下马”。为检验我国冰球后备力量而于今年春天在吉林市举行的全国第二届冬季青运会冰球赛，总共只有６支队伍参加。而代表我国冰球运动最高水平的国家队，一直徘徊在世界Ｂ组和Ｃ组之间的窘境中，今年只获得Ｃ组赛的第３名，晋级告吹。
    冰球界人士说，冰球运动耗资大，效益微（指金牌只有一枚），对于经费偏紧的各级体育部门来说，是一个负担很重的项目。去年某队在半年的训练中，仅冰球杆一项就耗资两万多元。一般市级体委是经不住如此消耗的。加之前不久国家体委调整布局，将冰球留在“重点”项目之外，使之受到冷遇。一些省、市在调整本地的项目布局时，冰球轻而易举地上了“下马”的名单。
    当我国冰球“前途渺茫”的阴影正在加重时，前不久，鸡西市钢窗厂厂长出资数万元，在哈尔滨市举办了轰动一时的全国美城杯女子冰球邀请赛。接着，国家体委在哈尔滨举办了首届全国女子冰球赛。来自黑龙江和吉林省的八支队伍参加了这两次比赛。我国女子冰球兴起不过四五年，人们关心它在世界冰坛的位置。
    去年，哈尔滨女子冰球队访问日本，四场比赛均以悬殊比分战胜了对手。日本参赛的都是其国内实力最强的队。在１９８７年于加拿大举行的国际邀请赛中，亚洲唯一参赛队——日本队曾获得了第５名。行家们据此推断，我国女子冰球水平大体处在世界中上游。
    一些企业家对此颇感兴趣，目前全国八支女子冰球队中，有一半是企业办队，即：鸡西钢窗厂队、哈尔滨飞机制造公司队、桦林橡胶厂队和吉林市化学工业公司二中队。
    有消息说，国际冰球联合会已决定于１９９０年举办首届世界女子冰球赛，我国准备调集人马，组织国家集训队，力争跻身世界先进水平行列。如果真能打出名堂，那么，冰球——这个从来是男子汉独占的领地，将成为我国竞技体育又一个阴盛阳衰的项目。
