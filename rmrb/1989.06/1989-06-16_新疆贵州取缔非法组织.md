The Xinjiang Public Security Bureau issued a notice on June 14, dissolving all illegal organizations within the region. The "Anti-Violence Strike Committee" at Xinjiang University announced its dissolution on June 13. The leaders and members of this organization, along with other illegal groups such as the "Save the Nation Association" and the "News Release Center," have registered with the campus public security office.

According to a report from Guiyang on June 16, 19 individuals, who were identified as leaders of the illegal organizations "Guizhou Province College Students Self-Government Federation," "Guiyang City Workers Self-Government Federation," and "Guiyang Salon Friendship Association," were apprehended on June 14 and 15. Additionally, 12 people voluntarily registered with the public security authorities and confessed their involvement.

Since their establishment, these organizations have been actively inciting strikes, organizing illegal demonstrations and sit-ins, creating reactionary slogans and leaflets, delivering reactionary speeches, and leading crowds to storm party and government leadership offices. After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, the leaders of these organizations organized so-called protest marches, purchased broadcasting equipment, spread rumors, openly incited unrest, and attempted to instigate strikes and market closures. They also promoted the so-called "empty school" movement in various colleges and universities, severely disrupting social order.

　　新疆贵州取缔非法组织
    本报乌鲁木齐６月１６日电  新疆公安厅６月１４日发出通告，取缔区内成立的一切非法组织。新疆大学非法组织“抗暴罢课组织委员会”于１３日发表声明宣布解散。该组织和其他几个非法组织“救国联社”、“新闻发布中心”的头目及成员，纷纷到校公安处登记。
    本报贵阳６月１６日电　６月１４、１５两天，被贵州省公安厅宣布为非法组织并予取缔的“贵州省高校学生自治联合会”、“贵阳市工人自治联合会”、“贵阳沙龙联谊会”的头头，已有１９名被抓获，１２人主动到公安机关登记并交待问题。
    这些组织成立以来，竭力煽动罢课，多次组织非法游行静坐，炮制反动标语、传单，发表反动演讲，并聚众冲击党政领导机关。北京平息反革命暴乱后，这些组织的头头组织所谓抗议游行，购置广播器材，大肆播放谣言，公开煽动闹事，并妄图鼓动罢工罢市，在各大专院校策动所谓的“空校”运动，严重破坏了社会秩序。
