In the Soviet Union's Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania, as a means of punishing drunk driving, special license plates are issued to drivers who have been detained for this offense.

The only difference between these special plates and ordinary ones is that the special plates all begin with the letter "O." This has a dual meaning: in Russian, the first letters of the words for "drunk" and "danger" are both "O."

When encountering a car with such a license plate, pedestrians "keep their distance," and the police closely monitor them. It is said that approximately two thousand such special license plates have been issued so far. This form of punishment is more effective than criticism or fines in making drunk drivers think twice.

    特殊车牌
    ●邓兆熊
    在苏联的爱沙尼亚、拉脱维亚和立陶宛，作为惩罚酒后开车的一种手段，发给被拘留过的这类驾驶者以特殊汽车牌号。
    与普通号牌的唯一不同之处是：特殊号牌都以字母“O”开头。它具有双重含义，在俄语中，醉酒和危险两字的字首均为“O”。
    遇到带这种号牌的汽车，行人“敬而远之”，警察严加监督。据说目前已发了大约两千个特殊号牌。这种惩罚手段比批评、罚款更能触动酒后违章开车者的思想。
