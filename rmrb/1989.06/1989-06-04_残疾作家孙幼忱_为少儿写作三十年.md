Edition: 4

	Disabled writer Sun Youqin has been dedicated to children's literature for 30 years. On the eve of Children's Day, students from several primary schools in Harbin, including Xinqiao Primary School, collectively donated a motorized tricycle to writer Sun Youqin using their pocket money, expressing their admiration for "Uncle Sun" who has been engaged in children's literary creation for 30 years.

	At the same time, the book "Ten Families of Scientific Fairy Tales" published by Shanghai Haiyan Publishing House is about to be released to young readers. This book includes representative works from 10 writers who have made significant contributions to the creation of scientific fairy tales since the founding of the People's Republic of China. Self-taught writer Sun Youqin is one of them.

	Sun Youqin, 52, contracted polio at the age of two, leaving him with disabled legs. In 1958, after graduating from high school, he worked as a worker while engaging in literary creation as a hobby. To date, he has published over 1 million words of works. His main works are scientific fairy tales, and he has also written two autobiographical novels, "The Small Path to the Strange World" and "Mountain Connecting Mountain," which describe the struggles and joys of a disabled person on the road of life. In his 8 collections of scientific fairy tales, totaling over 200 pieces, "The Adventures of Little Macaque," "The Mysterious Ant Kingdom," "The Clever Little Wooden Doll," and "Fifty-two Sundays" have each won awards from relevant national, Heilongjiang Province, and Harbin City organizations. He has also been named a National Advanced Worker for Children and Youth.

	Sun Youqin, with his optimistic and tenacious spirit, has taken the path of self-reliance, self-strengthening, and self-learning. To write the novella "The Adventures of Little Macaque," he self-studied "Zoology" and "Botany," and wheeled himself to the zoo to observe animals and to the library to look up references. This work has been published and sold 1.3 million copies and has been translated into Tibetan, Uyghur, and Braille, deeply loved by young readers.

　　残疾作家孙幼忱
    为少儿写作三十年
    新华社哈尔滨电（记者周佩琪）“六一”前夕，哈尔滨市新桥小学等几十所小学的学生们用自己的零花钱集体捐赠一台机动三轮车给作家孙幼忱，表达他们对从事儿童文学创作３０年的孙伯伯的敬爱之情。
    同时，由上海海燕出版社出版的《科学童话十家》就要与小读者见面。这里收入了建国以来在科学童话创作方面有建树的１０位作家的代表作，自学成才的孙幼忱就是其中之一。
    ５２岁的孙幼忱，两岁时患小儿麻痹症，双腿致残。１９５８年高中毕业后，他边当工人边从事业余文学创作，至今已发表了１００多万字的作品。他的主要作品是科学童话，还有两部描写一个残疾人在人生道路上的困难与拚搏、苦与乐的自传体长篇小说《通向奇异世界的小路》和《山连着山》。在他的８本集子共２００多篇科学童话中，《小狒狒历险记》、《神秘的蚂蚁国》、《聪明的小木娃》和《五十二个星期天》等曾分别获得全国有关方面、黑龙江省、哈尔滨市的嘉奖。他还被评为全国先进儿童少年工作者。
    孙幼忱以乐观、顽强的精神走上自强、自力、自学之路。为了写好中篇童话《小狒狒历险记》，他自学了《动物学》、《植物学》，还摇着车子到动物园去细心观察动物，到图书馆去查阅资料，这篇作品出版发行１３０多万册，还被译成藏文、维吾尔文和盲文，深受小读者喜爱。
