	The Escape of a Major General
	Zhang Meizhen
	In early June, a unit of the People's Liberation Army entered the capital to carry out martial law tasks and was intercepted and attacked by some people. To rescue the soldiers, many citizens extended their helping hands. Major General Shao Songgao of the Beijing Military Region recounted his ordeal while on his sickbed...

	"At 10 p.m. on June 2, our unit was ordered to advance from Fengtai to Tiananmen Square. When we reached Xidan intersection, our jeep was surrounded by pedestrians. At around 2:30 a.m. on June 3, a young man with long hair emerged from the crowd, grabbed my hair, and slapped me twice. He shouted, 'They are suppressing the people, beat him!' A group of people swarmed over, tearing my clothes, twisting my ears, and pulling my arms. My back and waist were hit with fists. Although we all had guns and ammunition at the time, to avoid injuring the crowd, we still maintained a restrained attitude as much as possible."

	"The attack lasted for more than seven hours. By around 9:30 a.m. on June 3, I began to show symptoms of low blood sugar, with my heart rate reaching 138 beats per minute. At this time, Dr. Chang Bixi from the Beijing Post and Telecommunications University and medical student Yang Xingqun from Beijing Medical University happened to pass by. After checking my pulse, they held up their identification cards and shouted, 'We are doctors, this soldier's life is in danger, he must be sent to the hospital for emergency treatment!' Immediately, about a dozen college students stepped forward, linking arms and shoulders to form a circular human wall, protecting me in the middle. An employee of Shougang Industrial Company, Mi Weiguo, took one arm to support me and the other to block the approaching crowd. Suddenly, an iron rod struck my head through the student's human wall. Mi Weiguo quickly blocked it with his arm, leaving a deep wound. To escort me, three students were beaten and injured, but they still shouted the slogan 'Do not beat people' and bravely moved forward."

	"I was taken to the traffic squad at Xidan, and the students brought me sugar water and pills to take. At this time, many people gathered at the door of the traffic squad. A middle-aged man walked up to me and whispered in my ear, 'Lie still on the chair, we'll say you're very sick.' With the help of the police, I was taken to the emergency center. When the hospital learned of my true identity, they immediately disguised me as a critically ill patient with myocardial infarction and put me under strict guard. The students who escorted me left their names before leaving, waving their hands and saying, 'Let's be friends, old soldier.'"

　　少将脱险记
    张梅珍
    ６月初，进入首都城区执行戒严任务的解放军某部遭到一些人的堵截、袭击。为了救护子弟兵，不少市民纷纷伸出援助之手。北京军区某部少将邵松高，在病榻上叙述了自己的遭遇……
    “２日晚上１０点，我部奉命从丰台向天安门广场进发。行至西单路口，我们乘坐的吉普车被行人团团围住。６月３日凌晨２点多钟，人群中冒出一个长头发的男青年，一把拽住我的头发，左右开弓就是两耳光。他叫嚣：‘他们是镇压人民的，打他！’一伙人蜂拥而上，撕衣服，拧耳朵，揪胳臂，我的背上、腰上都挨了拳头。尽管当时我们几个人都带着枪和子弹，但为了避免误伤群众，仍尽量保持着克制态度。”
    “围攻持续了７个多小时。到３日上午９点多钟，我开始出现低血糖症状，心率达每分钟１３８次。这时候，北京邮电学院医生常丙习和北京医科大学学生杨信群路经这里，他们号了我的脉后，就举着自己的工作证高喊：‘我们是医生，这位解放军的生命有危险，必须送到医院抢救！’人群中立刻走出十几位大学生，他们手挽手、肩并肩用自己的身体筑成一道圆形的人墙，把我保护在中间。首钢实业公司干部米卫国一手挽着我，一手遮挡靠近我的人群。突然，一根铁棍隔着学生人墙向我头上打来。米卫国急用手臂挡住，顿时，他的手臂上留下一道深深的血痕。为了护送我，有３名大学生挨打受伤，但是他们仍然高呼着‘不许打人’的口号英勇前行。”
    “我被送到西单的交通中队，学生们又送来糖水、药片让我服下。这时，有许多人围在交通队门口，一个中年人走到我身边，对着我的耳朵悄声说：‘你躺在椅子上千万别动，我们就说你病得很重。’在民警的协助下，我被送往急救中心。当医院知道了我的真实身份后，立即把我伪装成心肌梗塞的危重病人，严密监护起来。护送我的几位大学生临走时都留下了自己的姓名，他们挥挥手说：‘让我们交个朋友吧，老兵同志。’”
