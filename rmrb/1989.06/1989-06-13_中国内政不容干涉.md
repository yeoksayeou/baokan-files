Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian were key figures in the recent counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, where they engaged in extensive incitement and behind-the-scenes planning. After the failure of the counter-revolutionary riots, they fled to the U.S. Embassy in Beijing for "shelter." The U.S. State Department has openly admitted to providing so-called "protection" to Fang and Li. In this incident, what kind of people the so-called "democracy fighters" are and what role certain Americans played are now clear. All of this has caused great indignation among the Chinese people. The general public demands the arrest and trial of Fang and Li. Our public security organs have also issued a warrant for their arrest.

It is well known that Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian have consistently opposed the socialist system and the leadership of the Chinese government and the Communist Party of China. In recent years, they have often used Western journalists to publish speeches attacking the socialist system and vilifying the Communist Party of China and the government, to the point of being shameless. Fang and Li spread some bizarre rumors, openly declaring that "Marxism-Leninism is dead," calling for the "abandonment of the four cardinal principles," saying that the "way out for the mainland is capitalism," and even demanding the resignation of China's leaders. Some people abroad who are hostile to China have done everything possible to promote such people, hailing them as "democracy fighters." They do this only to dream of using people like Fang Lizhi to create chaos in China, abolish the leadership of the Communist Party, and overthrow China's socialist system. Fang and Li thought that with foreign backing, they could brazenly advocate for the implementation of a capitalist system in China. Now their evil intentions have been thoroughly crushed by the Chinese people.

Over the years, relations between China and the United States have developed steadily, with both sides engaging in normal economic, trade, and cultural exchanges, which is beneficial to both China and the United States. However, at the same time, we must not forget that there are always a few people in the United States who have consistently been hostile to communism and have used every means to influence some Chinese people with their bourgeois ideology and bourgeois political system to achieve the goal of establishing a bourgeois republic in China. It can be said that the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing are the result of the long-term spread of bourgeois liberalization thoughts. In this incident, some American media, especially "Voice of America," have done their utmost to fan the flames. After the Chinese government suppressed the counter-revolutionary riots, they spread rumors to mislead the public, trying to further escalate the situation and even hoping for a "civil war" in China. Recently, the United States has unilaterally taken actions that harm bilateral relations, which we absolutely cannot accept.

The U.S. Embassy in Beijing provided so-called "protection" to Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian, obstructing the Chinese judicial organs from legally arresting and punishing them, which is an infringement on China's sovereignty and inconsistent with recognized international legal norms.

It must be pointed out that the current events in China are purely China's internal affairs, and the Chinese government is stable. We will continue to adhere to the policy of reform and opening up and an independent foreign policy of peace. Anyone who attempts to exert pressure on the Chinese government in any way is unwise and shortsighted and will ultimately not be beneficial to themselves. China has always attached importance to developing relations with the United States. We hope that the U.S. side will, for the sake of the overall situation of Sino-U.S. relations and the long-term interests of the two countries, stop interfering in China's internal affairs and refrain from doing anything that harms bilateral relations.

　　中国内政不容干涉
    本报评论员
    方励之、李淑娴是在最近北京发生的反革命暴乱中进行大肆煽动和幕后策划的重要人物。反革命暴乱失败后，他们一头钻进了美国驻华大使馆“避难”去了。美国国务院已公开承认向方、李二人提供了所谓“保护”。在这一事件中，所谓“民主斗士”究竟是个什么样的人，美国某些人究竟扮演了什么角色，现在已昭然若揭。这一切不能不引起中国人民极大的义愤。广大人民群众要求缉拿、公审方、李二人。我公安机关也已对方、李发出了通缉令。
    众所周知，方励之、李淑娴二人一贯反对社会主义制度，反对中国政府和中国共产党的领导。近年来，他们经常通过西方记者，发表攻击社会主义制度，谩骂中国共产党和政府的言论，到了肆无忌惮的地步。方、李散布了一些离奇古怪的谣言，公开宣布“马列主义已经死亡”，要求“放弃四项基本原则”，说什么“大陆的出路就是资本主义”，甚至要中国领导人下台。国外一些敌视中国的人，千方百计地为这种人大捧特捧，把他们封为什么“民主斗士”。他们这样做，无非是梦想通过方励之等人把中国搞乱，取消共产党的领导，颠覆中国的社会主义制度。方、李以为有了外国靠山，猖狂地鼓吹在中国实行资本主义制度。现在他们这种罪恶企图已彻底地被中国人民粉碎了。
    多年来，中国同美国之间的关系有了平稳的发展，双方进行了正常的经济、贸易和文化往来，这对中美双方都是有利的。但是，与此同时，我们决不应该忘记，在美国总有少数人一贯仇视共产主义，千方百计用他们的资产阶级意识形态和资产阶级政治制度影响一部分中国人，以达到在中国建立资产阶级共和国的目的。可以说，这次在北京发生的动乱和反革命暴乱就是长期以来这种资产阶级自由化思想泛滥的结果。在这次事件中，美国某些宣传媒介、特别是“美国之音”，极尽推波助澜之能事。当中国政府平息反革命暴乱之后，他们又造谣惑众，企图进一步扩大事态，甚至希望中国爆发一场“内战”。近日来，美国又单方面采取有损两国关系的行动，这是我们绝对不能接受的。
    美国驻华大使馆给予方励之、李淑娴以所谓“保护”，阻挠中国司法机关对他们依法缉拿和惩处，是对中国主权的侵犯，是与公认的国际法准则不相符的。
    必须指出，中国目前发生的事件完全是中国的内政，中国政府是稳定的。我们将继续坚持改革、开放政策和独立自主的和平外交政策。任何人企图以这种或那种手段来向中国政府施加压力，都是不明智的，也是短视的，到头来对于他们自己也没有什么好处。中国一贯重视发展同美国的关系。我们希望美国方面能以中美关系大局为重，从中美两国关系的长远利益出发，停止干涉中国内政的行动，不要做任何损害两国关系的事情。
