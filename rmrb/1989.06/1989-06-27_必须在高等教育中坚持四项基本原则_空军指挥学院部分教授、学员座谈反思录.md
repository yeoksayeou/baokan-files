Deng Xiaoping's important speech on June 9, when he met with military leaders above the rank of general from the capital's martial law troops, has sparked strong reactions at the Air Force Command Academy. It has been the central topic of discussion among the faculty and students over the past period. Many faculty members have repeatedly studied and understood the speech, reflecting deeply on the roots and causes of the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion from both theoretical and practical perspectives. On June 21, the authors participated in a symposium held by some professors, scholars, and students of the academy. Everyone spoke freely and expressed their views, discussing some good insights on how to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles in higher education and oppose bourgeois liberalization.

The Four Cardinal Principles must be consistently upheld in all aspects of school political life

Deng Xiaoping pointed out that this counter-revolutionary rebellion has both an international climate and a domestic climate. In their discussion, they mentioned that, in terms of the domestic climate, an important factor is that the Four Cardinal Principles and the opposition to bourgeois liberalization have not been consistently upheld. The focus on both material and spiritual civilization has not been maintained, and ideological and political work and education on hard work have been relaxed. Since Deng Xiaoping proposed at the 1979 theoretical discussion meeting to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles, ten years have passed, but these important instructions have not been well and consistently implemented. The campaign to eliminate spiritual pollution in 1984 and the campaign against bourgeois liberalization in 1987 were both short-lived. Those who promoted liberalization became even more brazen, leading to a surge in liberalization trends and causing some people to lose their spiritual pillars. A serious ideological confusion emerged among some people, especially among some young students.

Vice Professor Kang Wenzhu from the Political Work Research Office mentioned that in the field of education, over the past few years, the emphasis on the Four Cardinal Principles has been insufficient, both in terms of position and effort. For example, in the teaching of courses like party history and modern history, students are rarely educated on the development of Chinese society and the growth of the party, so they do not understand basic truths such as "without the Communist Party, there would be no New China," "only socialism can save China," and "only the leadership of the Communist Party can achieve the Four Modernizations." In political classes over the past few years, there has been almost no discussion on the theory of class struggle. Anyone who mentions class struggle is criticized as "putting class struggle in command." Many political theory textbooks also lack content that positively guides students to establish a great communist ideal. Especially with students' extracurricular reading materials, a considerable portion is unhealthy. In recent years, phenomena such as "Freud fever," "Sartre fever," "martial arts fever," "Qiong Yao fever," "physiognomy fever," and "sexology fever" have all had varying degrees of negative impact on students' thinking. Over the past few years, college students on campus have been in their twenties, and in the process of forming their worldviews, they have been exposed to a lot of "exposure literature" and "scar literature," seeing many dark sides of society and some mistakes made by our party, which have had a subtle influence on their thinking. On one hand, this causes students to lose confidence in the party and socialism, and on the other hand, it provides a market for bourgeois liberalization. Some schemers who promote bourgeois liberalization always try to break through from the students. It is infuriating that in some colleges and universities, those who advocate upholding the Four Cardinal Principles are often ridiculed and cold-shouldered. While people like Fang Lizhi openly promote bourgeois liberalization and even reactionary propaganda, they do not receive the necessary resistance and criticism, leading to this turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, causing serious damage to the party and the state. It is clear that upholding the Four Cardinal Principles is the foundation of our country and education, just like food and clothing, and cannot be dispensed with for a moment. The Four Cardinal Principles must be consistently upheld in all aspects of school education and political life.

Two civilizations are like the two wheels of a car and the two wings of a bird; neglecting or emphasizing any one aspect will lead to serious consequences

Some faculty and students mentioned that one lesson from this counter-revolutionary rebellion is that the construction of socialist spiritual civilization has weakened, ideological and political work has weakened, and ideological education has weakened, and this is particularly evident in higher education.

Vice Professor Li Fenggang from the Political Work Research Office sighed, "I have been a political work teacher for 35 years and have increasingly felt that political work cadres are hard to be, and political classes are hard to teach. In recent years, the political work system has been continuously shrinking, and many local colleges and universities have dismantled or reduced their political education institutions to the point of near collapse. Many people engaged in political education have changed careers, and the remaining colleagues generally have a sense of loss. In the past, college teachers were confident when teaching Marxist basic theory courses, but in recent years, courses have been compressed, and even teaching Marxist theory too much can be labeled as rigid and conservative by some people. Worse still, in the field of ideological consciousness, a trend against Marxism, denigrating Marxism, and defaming Marxism has emerged in recent years, with some people covertly praising and promoting capitalism, forming a Western-centric trend that almost wants to completely copy Western political, moral, and ethical ideologies. In traditional education and ideological work, these years have only emphasized innovation, rarely mentioned inheritance, and even less mentioned actively carrying out ideological struggles; in dealing with issues like democracy and freedom, only democracy is mentioned, not the rule of law, only freedom is mentioned, not discipline. Some people equate speaking big truths with talking big, equate being able to speak big truths with being glib, and equate political work cadres with being at a loss."

Vice Professor Zhu Yawen from the Political Theory Research Office said that due to the weakness of spiritual civilization construction and ideological and political education, some young students lack ideals and correct pursuits, and the correct worldview is gradually fading, while the idea of "everything for money" is strengthened. In the eyes of some people, many non-commodities have become commodities, such as power, connections, certificates, diplomas, personality, flesh, conscience, etc., all of which can be sold as commodities. A teacher from a certain school, when moving, asked students for help, but the students asked how much money the teacher would give. The facts show that spiritual civilization construction and material civilization construction are like the two wheels of a car and the two wings of a bird; neglecting or emphasizing one aspect will lead to serious consequences. The lessons from our party's mistakes in education are profound and worthy of our eternal remembrance.

Neglecting or weakening the party's leadership makes it impossible to talk about upholding the Four Cardinal Principles in higher education

Many comrades, from the large number of facts from the recent turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital, have clearly seen that the evil purpose of a few reactionary elements in creating turmoil and rebellion is to negate the socialist system and overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, which we cannot tolerate.

Everyone mentioned that the Communist Party of China has passed the test of suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, once again proving that our party is still great, glorious, and correct. However, through reflection on this lesson, it is seen that since the reform and opening up, our party has indeed had some problems and made some mistakes in strengthening the party's leadership, giving a few bad elements the opportunity to create turmoil.

Student Chen Zhendong from the Third Platoon, Political Department Director of a certain regiment, analyzed the problem of the party's self-construction over the past few years from three aspects. First, in the party's theoretical construction, there is a lack of a complete theoretical system adapted to reform and opening up. For example, in the reform of the economic system, after implementing the separation of party and government, how to strengthen and play the role of the party in state-owned enterprises, private enterprises, joint ventures, and colleges and universities, research institutions, and other departments, there is still no clear path. Again, after not carrying out political movements, how to carry out ideological struggles within the party has not been well explored and summarized. Second, the party is not strictly governed. In the past few years, the large-scale rectification movement in some units was just a formality, and some degenerate and corrupt elements, and those who use power for personal gain were not dealt with. Especially in the development of a commodity economy, phenomena such as official profiteering and bribery have not been properly punished and eradicated, seriously damaging the party's prestige and image. Third, the party's fine traditions are not well carried forward. Some party organizations and members have become detached from the masses, and bureaucratism is serious, making the flesh-and-blood relationship between the party and the masses increasingly distant, seriously affecting the masses' trust in the party.

Student Wang Mingkun from the Fourth Platoon, Squadron Leader of a certain flight squadron, continued: Over a period of time, the propaganda and maintenance of the party's leadership also have three relationships that have not been properly handled. First, the relationship between achievements and mistakes has not been handled well, with too much emphasis on the various mistakes made by our party. Boldly exposing contradictions is a manifestation of our party's strength, but overemphasizing and exaggerating problems will cause people to lose confidence. Exposing problems must be done to the right degree to make people see the light in difficulties and increase their confidence and courage. Second, the relationship between administrative leadership and the role of party organizations has not been handled well. In many propagandas, only the factory director, manager, and principal are praised for "reversing the situation," while the role of the party's leadership in reform is not seen, as if the factory director, manager, and principal are reformers, while the party secretary is a conservative, and even some party secretaries and political work cadres are propagandized as obstacles to reform. Third, the relationship between the party organization's cultivation and individual efforts has not been handled well. Some people, especially some young people, after achieving success in their careers, rarely mention the party organization's cultivation, education, and help, only emphasizing that it is the result of self-struggle. Some people laugh and mock when they hear the song "Party, Dear Mother," thinking it is "self-indulgent." From the situation of the student movement to the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, some school party organizations appear weak and powerless. Some party members even lead the way in parading and demonstrating, not resisting and refuting rumors that attack the party and the government, but instead echoing and spreading them. These are the inevitable consequences of weakening the party's leadership in recent years.

Painful reflection, always remember the lessons of history

Reflecting on the past is for the sake of the future. The teachers and students of the Air Force Command Academy mentioned that the outbreak of this incident is worth our contemplation, prompting us to calmly consider the past and also consider the future. Dialectical materialism tells us that bad things can turn into good things under certain conditions. The outbreak of this incident has caused great losses to the party and the people's cause, which we do not want to see. But this incident is also a major exposure of the contradictions accumulated over the years, a comprehensive examination of our work over the years, and can prompt us to reflect, further summarize experiences and lessons. In this way, our steps in reform and opening up will be more stable, mistakes will be corrected faster, and advantages will be better developed.

Many comrades, in combination with reality, discussed their views on how to consistently uphold the Four Cardinal Principles in the field of teaching. Political Department Director Mei Qiyi said: From now on, the whole party and the whole country should unite in thought, reflect painfully, and truly take it as a historical lesson. We have made several mistakes of "not burning incense in peacetime and holding onto Buddha's feet in times of crisis." In times of smooth sailing, it is easy to relax ideological education, relax the study of Marxist-Leninist theory, and relax struggles in the ideological realm. Only when difficulties arise do we think of strengthening ideological and political work and seeking help from Marxism-Leninism. Now, we oppose bourgeois liberalization and should be as resolute and thorough as we were in negating the "Cultural Revolution." Upholding the Four Cardinal Principles should be consistently carried out for a long time, permeating all aspects of the party and state's political life and all fields of society. In higher education, the study and education of Marxist basic theory should be made a compulsory course for every discipline and major, positively indoctrinating students, establishing the positive atmosphere of propagating Marxism-Leninism, and occupying the ideological position of Marxism. The education of young people should start from primary school, cultivating in them a love for the party, the motherland, socialism, and a great ideal and correct worldview from a young age. Only in this way can the problem be solved from the root. Moreover, over the past few years, bourgeois liberalization has influenced students not only in one aspect but in all aspects and fields, such as propaganda, theory, culture, publishing, news, and education, all of which have different degrees of bourgeois liberalization phenomena. Therefore, it is also necessary to reflect and clean up from all aspects to create a good external environment for students' healthy growth.

Vice Professor He Xiaomin from the Political Theory Research Office believes that in the current situation of reform and opening up, it is particularly important to guide young students to correctly understand the relationship between upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up, and to correct the misconception among students that upholding the Four Cardinal Principles means that reform and opening up cannot be carried out. Upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and upholding reform and opening up are unified, and upholding the Four Cardinal Principles is precisely to better carry out reform and opening up and emancipate the mind. The more reform and opening up, the more the Four Cardinal Principles should be upheld. At the same time, in students and even the whole society, it is necessary to boldly carry out national conditions education and hard work education, correctly handle the relationship between entrepreneurship and enjoyment, so that young students both look forward to the future and work hard on the ground, and shoulder the responsibility of building the four modernizations.

Student Xu Zailin from the Third Platoon suggested strengthening ideological education, which is not just about adding a few more educational classes, but more importantly, it is necessary to truly regard ideological and political work as a lifeline, put it in its proper place, and overcome the current phenomenon of ideological and political work gradually shrinking. For some political institutions and political work cadres, especially political instructors and political teachers in colleges and universities, they should not be the target of every round of streamlining, but should build a strong ideological and political work cadre team to ensure that ideological and political work is not weakened organizationally.

　　必须在高等教育中坚持四项基本原则    
    ——空军指挥学院部分教授、学员座谈反思录
    庄聪生　荣庆祥　宗宝泉
    邓小平同志６月９日接见首都戒严部队军以上领导干部的重要讲话发表后，在空军指挥学院引起了强烈反响，成为人们近一段时间来议论的中心话题。许多教职员工反复学习领会，对这次发生的动乱和反革命暴乱的根源和起因，从理论和实践的结合上作了深刻反思。６月２１日，笔者参加了该院部分教授、学者、学员举行的座谈讨论，大家畅所欲言，各抒己见，围绕高等教育中如何坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的问题谈了一些好的见解。
    四项基本原则要始终贯穿于学校政治生活的各方面
    邓小平同志讲，发生这次反革命暴乱，既有国际的大气候，又有国内的小气候。他们在讨论中谈到，从国内的小气候来说，很重要的就是邓小平同志指出的，没有把坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化一贯地坚持下去，没有坚持两个文明一起抓，放松了思想政治工作和艰苦奋斗的教育。小平同志从１９７９年理论务虚会上提出要坚持四项基本原则到现在已经十年，但小平同志的这些重要指示没有得到很好的一贯的贯彻。１９８４年清除精神污染的斗争，１９８７年反对资产阶级自由化的斗争，都只搞了很短时间就草草收兵。那些搞自由化的人更加有恃无恐，结果导致自由化思潮泛滥，使一些人失去了精神支柱，有一部分人特别是部分青年学生中出现了严重的思想混乱。
    政工教研室副教授康文竹谈到，在教育领域里，这几年在坚持四项基本原则方面，无论从摆的位置，还是从下的功夫上看，都做得不够。例如在党史、近代史等课程教学中，就很少从中国社会历史的发展和党的成长壮大等方面对学生进行教育，使他们了解没有共产党就没有新中国、只有社会主义能够救中国、只有共产党的领导才能实现四个现代化这些基本道理。在讲政治课时，这几年几乎没有提到关于阶级斗争理论问题的论述，谁要提阶级斗争观点，就会被斥责为“以阶级斗争为纲”。许多政治理论教材也缺乏从正面引导学生树立共产主义远大理想的内容。特别是学生的课外读物，有相当一部分是不健康的。近几年来出现的“弗洛伊德热”、“萨特热”、“武侠热”、“琼瑶热”、“相学热”、“性学热”，等等，都不同程度地对学生的思想产生消极影响。这些年，在校的大学生都是２０多岁的青年人，在他们世界观形成的过程中，接触了许多“暴露文学”和“伤痕文学”，看到不少社会黑暗面和我们党的一些失误，对思想起到了潜移默化的作用。一方面使学生丧失对党、对社会主义的信心，同时又为资产阶级自由化提供了市场。一些别有用心的阴谋家们，搞资产阶级自由化时，总是想从学生中打开缺口。令人气愤的是，在一些大专院校里主张坚持四项基本原则的人，往往受到讥讽和冷遇。而像方励之之流明目张胆进行资产阶级自由化甚至反动宣传的，却得不到应有的抵制、批判，以致酿成了这场动乱和反革命暴乱，给党和国家造成了严重损失。可见，坚持四项基本原则是我们的立国之本，立教之本，如同布帛菽粟一样，不可须臾离开。四项基本原则必须始终贯穿于学校教育和政治生活中的各方面。
    两个文明好比车之两轮，鸟之两翼，偏重或忽视任何一个方面，都会导致严重后果
    一些教学员们谈到，这次反革命暴乱给我们党的一条教训，就是社会主义精神文明建设削弱了，思想政治工作削弱了，思想教育削弱了，在高等院校教育中，表现得更为突出。
    政工教研室副教授李凤刚感慨地说：“我当政工教员３５年，越来越感到政工干部难当，政治课难讲。这几年，政治工作体制结构不断地在缩小，地方许多院校政治教育机构拆的拆、减的减，到了快散架的程度。从事政治教育的人，相当一部分改行了，留下的这部分同志也普遍有一种失落感。过去，大专院校的教员在讲马克思主义基础理论课时都理直气壮，可这几年，课程压缩了不说，就连马克思主义理论讲多了，还会被一些人扣上僵化、保守的帽子。更有甚者，在思想意识形态领域中，这几年还出现了一股反马克思主义、贬低马克思主义、糟蹋马克思主义的思潮，一些人变相吹捧、宣扬资本主义，形成了西方中心思潮，几乎要把西方的政治、道德、伦理等意识形态全部照搬过来。在传统教育和思想工作中，这些年只强调创新，很少讲继承，更很少提开展积极的思想斗争；在处理民主、自由等问题时，只讲民主，不讲法制，只讲自由，不讲纪律。一些人还把讲大道理与说大话等同起来，把能讲大道理与耍嘴皮子相提并论，把政工干部搞得无所适从”。
    政理教研室副教授朱亚伟说，由于精神文明建设和思想政治教育薄弱，使得一些青年学生缺乏理想，缺乏正确的追求，正确的人生观不断地淡化，而“一切向钱看”的观念被强化。在一些人眼里，许多非商品的东西也成了商品，什么权力、条子、证件、文凭、人格、肉体、良心等都可以被当作商品出卖。有一所学校的老师搬家时，请学生帮忙，学生却问老师给多少钱才干。事实说明，精神文明建设和物质文明建设就好比车之两轮，鸟之两翼，偏重或忽视某一方面，都会导致严重后果。我们党在教育失误方面的教训极为深刻，值得我们永远记取。
    忽视或削弱党的领导，在高等教育中要坚持四项基本原则就无从谈起
    许多同志从首都最近一个时期发生的动乱和反革命暴乱的大量事实中，清醒地看到极少数反动分子制造动乱和暴乱，其罪恶目的就是要否定社会主义制度，推翻共产党的领导，这是我们所不能容忍的。
    大家谈到，中国共产党经受了这次平息反革命暴乱的考验，又一次证明了我们党仍然是伟大、光荣、正确的。但通过对这次教训的反思，看到了我们党自改革开放以来，在加强党的领导等方面确实存在一些问题，出现了一些失误，给少数坏人制造动乱以可乘之机。
    学员三队学员、某团政治处主任陈振东，就近年来党的自身建设问题从三个方面进行了分析。第一，在党的理论建设方面，缺乏一套适应改革开放的完整的理论体系。比如，在经济体制改革中，实行党政分开后，在国营企业、私人企业、合资企业和大专院校、科研单位等部门，如何发挥和加强党的领导，到现在还没有走出路子来。再如，不搞政治运动后，如何在党内开展思想斗争，也没有很好地探索和总结经验。第二，治党不严。前几年，人们希望很大的整党运动在一些单位走过场，一些蜕化变质分子、以权谋私的人没有得到处理。尤其是在发展商品经济中出现的官倒、行贿受贿等腐败现象，没有得到应有的惩治和根除，严重地损坏了党的威信和形象。第三，党的优良传统发扬不够。一些党组织和党员脱离群众，官僚主义严重，使党和群众的血肉关系日趋疏远，严重影响了群众对党的信任。
    四队学员、某部飞行大队长王明坤接着谈到：一段时间里，对党的宣传和维护党的领导也有三个关系没有处理好。首先是没有处理好成绩和失误的关系，过多地宣传我们党这样那样的失误。大胆揭露矛盾是我们党有力量的表现，但过多地渲染和夸大问题，就会使人丧失信心。揭露问题要掌握好“度”，才能使人民在困难中看到光明，增强信心和勇气。其次是没有处理好行政领导和党组织作用的关系。许多宣传中，只是宣传厂长、经理、校长如何“扭转乾坤”，而党的领导在改革中起到的作用却看不到，似乎厂长、经理、校长是改革派，而党委书记是保守派，甚至有的党委书记、政工干部被当作改革的绊脚石宣传。三是没有处理好党组织培养和个人作用的关系。有的人，特别是某些青年人在事业上取得成就后，很少讲到党组织的培养教育和帮助，只强调是自我奋斗的结果。有些人听到唱《党啊，亲爱的妈妈》这首歌时，就嘲笑、挖苦，觉得是“自作多情”。从这次学潮到动乱、反革命暴乱的情况来看，一些学校的党组织显得软弱无力。有的党员还带头参加游行、示威，对一些攻击党和政府的谣言不仅不抵制和批驳，反而随声附和，甚至进行传播和扩散。这些，不能不说是近几年削弱党的领导所酿成的恶果。
    痛定思痛，永远记住历史的教训
    反思过去，是为了开辟未来。空军指挥学院的教师、学员们谈到，这次事件爆发出来，很值得我们思索，促使我们很冷静地考虑一下过去，也考虑一下未来。唯物辩证法告诉我们，坏事在一定条件下可以变为好事。这次事件的爆发，给党和人民的事业造成了重大损失，这是我们很不愿意看到的。但这次事件也是多年来积累下来的矛盾的大暴露，是对我们这些年来的工作的一次全面的检验，可以促使我们进行反思，进一步总结经验教训。这样，我们今后的改革开放的步子就会迈得更稳，失误纠正得更快，长处发扬得更好。
    许多同志结合实际，就如何在教学领域里坚持四项基本原则一贯性的问题，谈了自己的见解。政治部主任梅其仪说：从现在开始，全党、全国上下，都应该统一思想，痛定思痛，真正把它作为历史教训记取下来。我们已经犯过几回“平时不烧香，急时抱佛脚”的毛病。顺利时，就容易放松思想教育，放松马克思列宁主义理论的学习，放松意识形态里的斗争。遇到困难情况，才想到抓思想政治工作，才求救于马克思列宁主义。现在，我们反对资产阶级自由化，就应该像否定“文化大革命”那样坚决、彻底。坚持四项基本原则要长期一贯地抓下去，把四项基本原则贯穿到党和国家政治生活中的各个环节，贯穿到社会的各个领域里。在高校教育中，要把马克思主义基础理论的学习和教育，作为每个学科和专业的必修课，对学生进行正面灌输，把宣传马列主义的正气树起来，占领马克思主义的思想阵地。对青年的教育，还要从上小学时就开始抓起，从小培养他们热爱党、热爱祖国、热爱社会主义、树立远大的理想和正确的人生观。只有这样，才能从根本上解决问题。另外，这几年，资产阶级自由化对学生的影响不只是某一个方面，而是表现在各个方面和各个领域，诸如宣传、理论、文化、出版、新闻、教育等领域，都不同程度地存在着资产阶级自由化现象。因此，还要从各个方面进行反思和清理，为学生的健康成长创造良好的外部环境。
    政治理论教研室副教授贺晓敏认为，在当前改革开放的形势下，要尤其注意引导青年学生正确认识坚持四项基本原则和改革开放的关系，纠正学生中存在的认为坚持四项基本原则就不能搞改革开放的糊涂观念。坚持四项基本原则与坚持改革开放是统一的，坚持四项基本原则正是为了更好地实行改革开放和解放思想。越是改革开放，越是要坚持四项基本原则。同时，要在学生中乃至全社会，理直气壮地进行国情教育和艰苦奋斗教育，摆正创业与享受的关系，使青年学生既向往未来，又脚踏实地奋斗，担负起建设四化的重任。
    三队学员许在林建议，加强思想教育，不仅是多设几堂教育课的问题，更重要的是要切实把思想政治工作作为生命线来看待，真正放到应有的位置，克服目前思想政治工作日趋萎缩的现象。对有些政治机构和政工干部，尤其是院校的政治辅导员、政治教员，不能作为每次精简的对象，而应建立一支强有力的思想政治工作干部队伍，从组织上保证思想政治工作不被削弱。
