On May 11, after salvage efforts, the floating gate for maintenance that had sunk in the navigation channel downstream of the No. 1 ship lock at the Gezhouba Dam on April 25 gradually emerged from the water (see picture). It is said that the sinking of the floating gate was caused by the bottom valve not being closed tightly, allowing river water to enter and causing the incident. All the electrical equipment also sank into the water. Strangely, during the two or three days when the floating gate was taking on water and slowly sinking, the relevant departments did not immediately take rescue measures, but instead watched as the floating gate sank to the bottom of the river. The preliminary estimate of the loss is over 500,000 yuan.

For such an important project and important equipment, how could this happen? It is indeed thought-provoking!

    浮门沉没记
    5月11日，经打捞，4月25日在葛洲坝大江1号船闸下游引航道内沉没的船闸浮式检修门缓缓露出江面（见图）。据说，这浮门沉没是因底阀关闭不严，漏进江水而引起的。全部电机设备也随之淹没水中。奇怪的是，在浮门进水，缓缓下沉的两三天时间里，有关部门竟没有立即采取挽救措施，而是眼睁睁地看着浮门沉入江底。初步估计，损失在50万元以上。
    重要工程，重要设备，何至如此，岂不发人深省！
