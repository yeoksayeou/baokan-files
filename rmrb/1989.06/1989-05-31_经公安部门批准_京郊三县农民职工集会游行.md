Today, tens of thousands of farmers, workers, teachers, and government officials from three suburban counties held a rally and march to protest the turmoil created by a small number of people.

Early this morning, more than 10,000 farmers, workers, commercial employees, and teachers from Shunyi County gathered in the square of Shunyi County First Middle School to hold a "Mass Meeting to Resolutely Oppose Turmoil." The attendees sent an open letter to the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the municipal government in the name of the mass meeting. The letter stated: "The patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of young students is precious. Their desire to rectify corruption, punish officials who have turned against the people, overcome bureaucratism, and advance the democratic process is good. It is in line with the wishes of the Party and the government and is also our wish as farmers. However, we do not approve of their arbitrary use of marches, demonstrations, sit-ins, and hunger strikes. Such actions not only do not help solve the problem but also easily escalate the situation, providing an opportunity for a very small number of people with ulterior motives to create turmoil. We hope that the young students will calm down, return to class as soon as possible, study well, and become useful talents for the modernization drive, not disappointing the Party and the people's expectations."

It is understood that Daxing County and Huairou County also held similar rallies in their county seats this afternoon.

After the mass meeting ended, part of the attendees held a march in the county seat. Today's march was approved by the public security authorities. The banners and slogans held and shouted by the marchers mainly included: "Resolutely oppose turmoil!" "Resolutely support the speeches of Comrade Li Peng and Comrade Yang Shangkun!" "Oppose bourgeois liberalization!" "Long live the People's Liberation Army!" "Win the summer battle!"

　　经公安部门批准
    京郊三县农民职工集会游行
    新华社北京５月３１日电  今天，京郊三个县数以万计的农民、职工、教师和机关干部集会并举行游行，抗议极少数人制造动乱。
    清晨，顺义县１万多名农民、工人、商业职工、教师聚集在顺义县第一中学的广场上，召开了“坚决反对动乱群众大会”。集会者以群众大会的名义给中共北京市委、市政府发出一封公开信。信中说：“广大青年学生的爱国热情是宝贵的，他们要求整治腐败、惩治官倒、克服官僚主义、推进民主进程的愿望是好的，同党和政府的主张是一致的，也是我们农民的愿望。但是，我们不赞成他们任意采取游行、示威、静坐、绝食的做法，这样做不但无助于问题的解决，反而容易扩大事态，给极少数极少数别有用心的人制造动乱提供可乘之机。我们希望青年学生冷静下来，尽快复课，学好本领，成为四化建设的有用之才，不辜负党和人民的期望。”
    据了解，大兴县和怀柔县今天下午也分别在县城举行了类似的集会。
    群众大会结束以后，一部分集会者在县城举行了游行。今天的游行是经公安部门批准的。游行队伍举的横幅和呼喊的口号主要有：“坚决反对动乱！”“坚决拥护李鹏、杨尚昆同志的讲话！”“反对资产阶级自由化！”“人民解放军万岁！”“打好三夏这一仗！”
