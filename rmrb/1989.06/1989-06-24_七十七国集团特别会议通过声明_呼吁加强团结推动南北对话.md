The three-day ministerial-level special meeting of the 77 Group concluded last night. The meeting adopted the "Caracas Declaration," calling on developing countries to strengthen internal unity, promote South-South cooperation, and advance South-North dialogue to meet future challenges.

The "Caracas Declaration" consists of four parts: First, facing the future, calling for the resumption of South-North dialogue; second, the 77 Group and the promotion of international economic cooperation for development; third, economic and technological cooperation among developing countries; fourth, the efficiency of the 77 Group's institutions.

The declaration points out that in recent years, amidst a turbulent and complex international situation, a new trend of easing has emerged, creating favorable conditions for strengthening international economic cooperation and implementing new development strategies. The declaration states that only by reforming the current irrational economic order and helping developing countries solve their severe economic difficulties can long-term stability in the international political environment be ensured.

The declaration calls on developed countries to actively participate in constructive South-North dialogue and take concrete measures to cooperate with developing countries in science and technology, credit, trade, and debt, to change the current imbalance in global economic development.

The declaration also emphasizes the importance of global South-South cooperation among developing countries. The declaration reaffirms that the 77 Group will, in accordance with the spirit of the United Nations Charter, strive to seek various forms of cooperation in the fields of economy, society, and culture, jointly overcome obstacles on the road ahead, and contribute to the realization of international peace and security.

During the meeting, representatives from various countries expressed their views on the current international situation facing developing countries, the changes in the new situation, and the policies and strategies that should be adopted in South-South cooperation and South-North dialogue. They advocated that developing countries should combine the long-term goal of establishing a new international economic order with solving current urgent problems, and adopt pragmatic and flexible attitudes and policies in South-North relations.

The meeting also adopted two final documents on South-North relations and South-South cooperation. These two documents will serve as the basis for the 77 Group to formulate future actions and strategies.

    呼吁加强团结推动南北对话
    本报加拉加斯６月２４日电  记者朱满庭报道：历时３天的７７国集团部长级特别会议于昨晚圆满闭幕。会议通过了《加拉加斯声明》，呼吁发展中国家加强内部团结，促进南南合作，推动南北对话，以迎接未来的挑战。
    《加拉加斯声明》包括４个部分：一、面对未来，呼吁恢复南北对话；二、７７国集团与推动促进发展的国际经济合作；三、发展中国家的经济技术合作；四、７７国集团的机构效率。
    声明指出，近年来，在动荡复杂的国际局势中出现了缓和的新趋势，为加强国际经济合作和实行新的发展战略创造了有利条件。声明说，只有改革当前不合理的经济秩序，帮助发展中国家解决严重经济困难，才能保证国际政治环境的长期稳定。
    声明呼吁发达国家积极参加富有建设性的南北对话，并采取切实措施，在科技、信贷、贸易和债务等方面同发展中国家开展合作，来改变当前世界经济发展不平衡的状态。
    声明还强调了发展中国家之间开展全球性南南合作的重要性。声明重申，７７国集团将按照联合国宪章精神，努力寻求经济、社会和文化等领域中不同形式的合作，共同克服前进道路上的障碍，为实现国际和平与安全作出贡献。
    会议期间，各国代表在一般性辩论中纷纷就当前发展中国家面临的国际形势的变化和在新形势下南南合作与南北对话等问题上应采取的方针战略发表意见，主张发展中国家应把建立新的国际经济秩序的长远目标与解决当前紧迫问题结合起来，在南北关系上采取务实与灵活的态度和方针。
    会议还通过了关于南北关系和南南合作的两个最后文件。这两个文件将成为７７国集团制订今后的行动和战略的基础。
