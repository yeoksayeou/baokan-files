A friend wrote to me saying that he has many hobbies, such as playing ball, playing the erhu, writing scripts, dancing... but in the end, he is not proficient in any of them and has achieved nothing.

A few days later, a colleague said to me with a sense of inferiority: "Apart from work, I have no hobbies. Whenever colleagues achieve something through their hobbies, I feel like I've missed out on a lot."

Once a person has a hobby and pursues it with a purpose, life becomes more fulfilling and rich, and work and career become more manageable.

"Hobbies" are quite captivating. For example, dancing, playing ball, chatting, creating... often captivate people to the point of forgetting to eat and sleep, and being restless.

"Hobbies" also have an element of "mixing around." Some people today "love" this, tomorrow "love" that. In a year of 365 days, there are 365 "hobbies." In the end, they only end up with "white hair in youth, vainly lamenting" their fate.

In a sense, "hobbies" are a prelude to a person's choice of career and lifestyle, and the beginning of a career. How should one handle the relationship between "hobbies" and one's main job? I think: as long as one integrates "hobbies" with one's main job, using "hobbies" to promote work, this approach not only gains the support of superiors but also adds joy to life. In one's career, it will also produce some "unplanned" results.

Friends, it's better to have more "hobbies."

### 话说“爱好”

　　话说“爱好”
    殷双全
    一位朋友来信说，他有很多爱好，譬如：打球，拉二胡，写剧本，跳舞……可是到头来一门也不精通，一事无成。
    没过几天，一位同事自卑地对我说：“除了上班外，什么爱好也没有。一旦同事们利用业余爱好搞出一些名堂来，就觉得自己失落太多。”
    一个人一旦有了业余爱好，并有目的的一直爱下去，生活就显得充实而又富有得多，工作和事业也得心应手。
    “爱好”是很有迷力的，譬如；跳舞，打球，侃大山，创作……常常迷得人废寝忘食，心神不安。
    “爱好”中也有“混”的成份，有的人今天“爱好”这；明天“爱好”那。一年３６５天，就有３６５个“爱好”。到头来，只落得个“白了少年头，空悲切”的下场。
    从某种意义上讲：“爱好”是一个人选择职业和生活方式的序言，是事业进程的开端。如何处理好“爱好”与本职工作的关系呢？我想：只要把“爱好”与本职工作紧密联系起来，以“爱好”促进工作。这样做，不仅能取得顶头上司的支持，而且还会给生活增加乐趣，事业上还会搞出一点“计划外”的成果来。
    朋友，还是多一点“爱好”吧。
