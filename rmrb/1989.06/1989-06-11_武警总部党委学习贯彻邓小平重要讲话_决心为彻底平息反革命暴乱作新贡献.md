The Party Committee of the Public Security Bureau Headquarters and the cadres and soldiers of the headquarters have studied Chairman Deng Xiaoping's important speech during his reception of senior officers of the martial law troops. They have taken effective measures and are determined to make new contributions to the complete suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot.

On the evening of the 9th and the morning of the 10th, the Public Security Bureau Headquarters held two expanded meetings of the Party Committee and a meeting of cadres and soldiers, attended by leaders from the headquarters' staff, political, and logistics departments, as well as leaders from the Beijing Brigade. Commander Li Lianxiu and Political Commissar Zhang Xiufu conveyed Deng Xiaoping's important speech during his reception of senior officers of the martial law troops and organized a thorough discussion.

To implement Deng Xiaoping's instructions on completely suppressing the riot, the Party Committee of the Public Security Bureau Headquarters requires the Public Security Bureau troops to closely cooperate with the People's Liberation Army and public security police. They should strengthen the following aspects of work:

Organize all cadres and soldiers to seriously study Deng Xiaoping's important speech, strengthen the troops' ideological and political work, further unify thoughts, firmly establish beliefs, and stand firmly and clearly against a small number of rioters and bad elements.

Strictly implement the State Council's notice on decisively stopping the assault on railways and ensuring the safety and smooth operation of railway transportation. Fully complete the tasks assigned to the Public Security Bureau troops in the notice, ensure the absolute safety of bridges, tunnels, and culverts, and dispatch troops to maintain order at stations and stop activities that block trains and damage railway facilities.

All levels of leadership and cadres should further improve their work style, break conventions, and improve organizational command. They should care for the troops, cherish the troops, and find ways to improve the troops' living conditions. Ensure that cadres and soldiers eat well and sleep well, maintain high spirits, and always maintain a strong fighting spirit.
