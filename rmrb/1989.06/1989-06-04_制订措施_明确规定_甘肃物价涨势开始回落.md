The upward trend in prices in Gansu Province has begun to ease in the second quarter, with the price increase index in April dropping by 1.3% compared to March.

Since January this year, the Gansu Provincial Government has been holding a monthly meeting of the Standing Committee or the Governor's Office to specifically study price issues and formulate measures. The provincial government has explicitly stipulated that 19 essential items for people's livelihood and service charges are not allowed to increase in price. Some cities and prefectures have added more items to the list of price-controlled goods and made supplementary regulations. The government of Baiyin City has stipulated that state-owned enterprises are not allowed to wholesale matches, white sugar, salt, and other eight items to individual merchants, otherwise, they will be severely dealt with. Tianzhen City has also implemented differential control on 19 types of liberalized commodities such as daily plastic products. The provincial government requires the Commission of Economic Planning to arrange the allocation and supply of raw materials needed for the production of the 19 items, just like the planned production and sales of chemical fertilizers, to ensure the implementation of the measures.

　　制订措施　明确规定
    甘肃物价涨势开始回落
    新华社兰州６月２日电  （记者王丁）甘肃省第二季度物价上涨趋势开始回落，４月份物价上涨指数比３月份降低了１．３％。
    甘肃省政府从今年元月份起，每月召开一次常务会议或省长办公会，专门研究物价工作，制定措施。省政府明文规定，１９种人民生活必需品和服务收费不准涨价。有的地市还增加了不涨价商品品种，并做了补充规定。白银市政府规定，不准国营单位将火柴、白糖、食盐等８种商品批发给个体商贩，否则将严肃查处。天水市还对日用塑料制品等１９种放开商品实行差率控制。省政府要求计经委要像对计划生产、销售化肥一样，对１９种商品生产所需原材料货源的调拨、供应进行安排，以保证措施实施。
