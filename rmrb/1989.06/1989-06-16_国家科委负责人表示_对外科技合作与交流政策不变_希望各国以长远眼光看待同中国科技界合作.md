Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 16th.

The deputy director of the State Science and Technology Commission, Zhu Lilian, said in an interview with reporters today that China's policy on international scientific and technological cooperation and exchange will not change. She hopes that all countries and organizations willing to maintain and develop scientific and technological cooperation and exchange with China will view their cooperation with China's scientific community with a long-term perspective and cherish the scientific and technological cooperation and exchange relationships established over the years.

Zhu Lilian said that during the recent counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing and the turmoil in some cities, some foreign scientific and technological experts insisted on staying in China and continued to carry out scientific and technological cooperation and exchange with their Chinese counterparts. They made a correct judgment about China's domestic situation. On behalf of the State Science and Technology Commission, I would like to express my gratitude for their friendship and cooperation with the Chinese scientific community.

She said that during the period when China suppressed the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, some countries temporarily suspended some of their scientific and technological cooperation and exchange with China and recalled their scientific and technological experts working in China. She believes this is a temporary phenomenon. International scientific and technological cooperation and exchange have always been mutually beneficial. It is not only the wish of the Chinese government and the broad masses of Chinese scientific and technological workers but also the common wish of the governments and scientific and technological workers of various countries.

Zhu Lilian introduced that since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, under the guidance of the independent and peaceful foreign policy and the policy of reform and opening up, China's scientific and technological cooperation and exchange with various countries have developed greatly, forming a multi-level, multi-channel, and multi-form international scientific and technological cooperation pattern. On the basis of equality and mutual benefit, China has carried out official, civilian, bilateral, and multilateral scientific and technological cooperation and exchange with 108 countries and regions. The Chinese scientific community treasures the achievements made in the past decade and will continue to make its own contributions to the development of international scientific and technological cooperation. She emphasized that the policy of reform and opening up is a long-term policy of China, and we must continue to adhere to and better implement it. We will continue to carefully implement the scientific and technological cooperation and exchange plans and projects that have been agreed upon with foreign government departments; the scientific and technological exchange activities held in China and abroad, except for those that are temporarily postponed due to objective difficulties after consultation, will be carried out as planned; we will continue to carry out various civilian and multilateral international scientific and technological cooperation projects and academic exchanges; we will do a good job of receiving foreign scientific and technological experts and scholars who come to China to implement cooperation plans, ensuring their safety and completing their assigned tasks.

　　国家科委负责人表示
    对外科技合作与交流政策不变
    希望各国以长远眼光看待同中国科技界合作
    新华社北京６月１６日电  国家科委副主任朱丽兰今天在接受记者采访时说，中国对外科技合作与交流的政策不会变。希望一切愿意同中国保持和发展科技合作与交流的国家和组织，能以长远的眼光看待同中国科技界的合作，珍惜这些年建立起来的科技合作与交流关系。
    朱丽兰说，最近在我国北京发生反革命暴乱和一些城市发生动乱期间，一些外国科技专家坚持留在中国，继续同中国同行开展科技合作和交流，他们对中国的国内形势作出了正确的判断。我代表国家科委，感谢他们同中国科技界的友谊和合作精神。
    她说，在我国平息北京发生的反革命暴乱期间，也有少数国家中止了同我国的一些科技合作和交流往来，撤回他们在华工作的科技专家。她认为这是一种暂时的现象。国际科技合作与交流从来都是互利的。它不仅是我国政府和我国广大科技人员的愿望，也是各国政府和各国科技人员的共同愿望。
    朱丽兰介绍说，自从中国共产党十一届三中全会以来，我国在独立自主的和平外交政策和改革开放方针指引下，同世界各国的科技合作关系和交流往来有了很大发展，已经形成了一个多层次、多渠道、多形式的国际科技合作局面。在平等互利的基础上，我国已经同世界上１０８个国家和地区开展了官方、民间、双边、多边的科技合作和交流。中国科技界十分珍惜十年来取得的这一成果，并将继续在发展国际科技合作事业中做出自己的贡献。她强调，改革开放的方针是中国的一项长期政策，我们一定要继续坚持并且更好地贯彻执行。我们将继续认真执行与外国政府部门已经达成的科技合作与交流的计划和项目；我国在国内外举办的科技交流活动，除因客观条件暂时有困难的，经协商暂时推迟外，其他项目都将按计划进行；我们要继续进行各种民间和多边的国际科技合作项目和学术交流活动；要认真做好为执行合作计划来华的外国科技专家和学者的接待工作，使他们完成预定任务，他们的安全是有保障的。
