Hard Training for National Glory
— A Glimpse into the Lives of Soldiers in the Republic's Salute Battery Unit
Zhao Baoyu

On March 28, 1989, the Republic's salute battery unit celebrated its fifth anniversary of re-establishment. Over the past five years, the unit has fired salute cannons 140 times to welcome guests, earning a collective second-class merit citation. Chairman Yang Shangkun inscribed "Hard Training for National Glory" to encourage them.

A Glorious and Sacred Mission

In the scorching summer, under the blazing sun, the wide training ground offers no shade. The scorching sun beats down on the soldiers, and by the time they finish training, their uniforms are soaked with sweat. In the bitter winter, with the biting cold wind, they train for over ten hours each day to master the skills of cannon operation.

Once, during a welcoming ceremony, after the command "Take position" was given, the national leaders and foreign guests did not arrive on time due to unforeseen circumstances. Despite the temperature soaring to 40 degrees Celsius, the heat waves rising from the concrete slabs on Tiananmen Square, the soldiers remained kneeling on the ground, awaiting orders. Their uniforms were drenched in sweat, but not a single soldier moved to wipe the sweat or tilt their head.

The Cannon Holds the Soldiers' Hearts

Over the past five years, the new and old soldiers of this unit have spent their most beautiful years on this 5-meter-long cannon position.

Soldier Li Fahong, holding his third-class merit medal, stood by his fiancée's grave, which was already overgrown with grass, and silently shed tears. At this moment, he had already been demobilized. Before enlisting, he was an orphan, and his fiancée was his only relative. In 1984, just before National Day, as the unit was in the most intense training phase to celebrate the 35th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China, a sudden piece of bad news pushed him into the depths of sorrow. Within two days, he received three urgent telegrams from the local government: "Fiancée seriously ill," "Fiancée in critical condition," and "Fiancée deceased." Upon learning of this, the brigade leaders insisted that he return home to handle the funeral. At that moment, he desperately wanted to fly back home, even if it was just to see his fiancée one last time. However, he did not go back. He thought: The 35th anniversary celebration is imminent, and I am a second cannon operator. I must ensure the flawless completion of the salute cannon firing for the 35th anniversary. How can I leave at this critical moment? Thus, he merged his sorrow into the intense training.

They Add Luster to the Country of Propriety and Justice

The salute-firing armed police soldiers, on the solemn Tiananmen Square, welcome guests from all over the world with the sound of salute cannons. Their skilled techniques and selfless dedication have received high praise from the Party, the people, and foreign guests! On September 16, 1987, Chairman Li Xiannian entrusted Foreign Minister Wu Xueqian to host a banquet at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse to commend the salute battery company and other welcoming troops.

In the salute battery unit, officers and soldiers will never forget this experience. On March 1, 1984, the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council entrusted the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to restore the honorable and arduous task of salute cannon firing to the General Headquarters of the People's Armed Police. After several deliberations, this task finally fell on their shoulders. At that time, the newly re-established salute battery unit was to perform a welcoming task just 20 days later. Faced with difficulties, this unit showed a tenacious spirit. On March 24, 1984, the day the salute battery unit performed its first welcoming salute cannon firing on Tiananmen Square since its re-establishment, they forgot the cold in front of the cameras and video cameras of journalists from various countries and completed the task excellently. When former Japanese Prime Minister Nakasone visited China, he saw the salute cannons of the People's Republic of China, which had been silent for 18 years, being fired again on Tiananmen Square by the armed police soldiers in olive-green uniforms. He excitedly gave a thumbs up and said, "China's salute cannons are fired very well, shaking my five viscera!"

Ah! As the national anthem plays, the salute cannons roar, the salute battery soldiers here display national prestige, strengthen national spirit, and add luster to the country of propriety and justice!

　　刻苦训练　为国争光
    ——共和国礼炮部队战士生活剪影
    赵宝玉
    １９８９年３月２８日，共和国的礼炮部队重建５周年。５年来，这个部队鸣炮迎宾１４０次，荣立集体二等功，国家主席杨尚昆为他们题写了“刻苦训练，为国争光”，以示勉励。
    光荣而神圣的使命
    盛夏，烈日当空，宽阔的操炮场上无遮荫之地，火辣辣的阳光照射在战士们身上，从训练场下来，警服全被汗水湿透了。严冬，寒风刺骨，为了练就一身强硬的操炮本领，他们每天坚持训练十几个小时。
    有一次礼炮兵们在执行迎宾任务中，当指挥员的一声“就位”的口令下达后，国家领导人和外宾因故没有准时到达，尽管气温高达摄氏４０度，烈日蒸烤得天安门广场上的水泥方砖腾起阵阵热浪，战士们仍然跪在地上待命，汗水湿透了他们的警服，却没有一个人擦擦汗，歪歪头。
    礼炮牵着战士的心
    ５年来，这支部队的新老战士们在这５米长的炮位上度过了自己一生中最美好的年华。
    战士李发红，双手捧着３等功奖章，站在已经长满了青草的未婚妻坟前，默默地流泪。此时，他已经复员了。入伍前，他就是个孤儿，未婚妻是他的唯一亲人。１９８４年国庆前的一天，正当部队为迎接国庆３５周年大庆而进入了最紧张的训练阶段时，一个突如其来的噩耗把他推向了痛苦的深渊，两天之中，他先后收到当地政府连续发来“未婚妻病重、病危、病故”３封加急电报。支队领导得知此事后，硬逼他回去料理后事，此刻，他多想飞回家去，哪怕最后再看未婚妻一眼，可是，他终于没有回去，他想：３５周年大庆迫在眉睫，自己又是一名二炮手，要万无一失地完成３５周年大庆鸣放礼炮任务，怎能在这个关键时刻离开呢？于是，他又把悲痛融化在紧张的训练之中。
    他们为礼义之邦添光彩
    鸣放礼炮的武警战士们，在庄严的天安门广场，用礼炮声迎接四海宾朋，他们熟练的技术，无私奉献的精神受到了党和人民以及外宾的高度赞扬！１９８７年９月１６日，国家主席李先念曾委托吴学谦外长在钓鱼台国宾馆设宴慰问礼炮中队和其他迎宾官兵。
    在礼炮部队，干部战士都忘不了这样一段经历。１９８４年３月１日党中央、国务院委托外交部，将恢复鸣放礼炮这一光荣而艰巨的任务交给武警总部之后，几经酝酿，才使这一任务正式落在他们肩上的情景。当时，刚刚重建的这支礼炮部队２０天后就要执行迎宾任务。在困难面前，这支部队却表现出了一种顽强的作风。１９８４年３月２４日，是这支部队重建以来首次在天安门广场鸣放迎宾礼炮的一天，面对各国记者的拍照、录相，他们忘记了寒冷，出色地完成了任务。日本前任首相中曾根访华时，当他亲眼看到中华人民共和国消声匿迹１８年后的迎宾礼炮，又在天安门广场上，被这支身着橄榄绿警服的武警战士们再度鸣响时，他激动地伸出大拇指说：“中国的礼炮打得真好，把我的五脏都震荡了！”
    啊！国歌奏响，礼炮声声，礼炮兵们在这里扬国威，壮国魂，为礼义之邦添光彩！
