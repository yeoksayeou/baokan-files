The full artificial breeding of the large yellow croaker has achieved success in the eastern coastal region of Fujian Province.

This achievement was primarily completed by experts from the Min Dong Aquaculture Research Institute's large yellow croaker research team. The large yellow croaker fry are 43 days old, with an average body length of 2.18 centimeters and a weight of 0.15 grams. The largest individual has a body length of 2.5 centimeters. The successful artificial breeding of the large yellow croaker brings hope for the restoration of large yellow croaker resources and lays the foundation for the domestication of large yellow croaker. Experts believe this is a significant scientific and economic research achievement.
