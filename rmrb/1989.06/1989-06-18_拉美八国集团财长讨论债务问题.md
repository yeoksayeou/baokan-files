The finance ministers of the Latin American Eight Group met yesterday in Caracas to discuss debt issues. The ministers called on industrialized countries to review their financial systems and encourage commercial banks to participate in debt reduction efforts.

The ministerial-level meeting lasted a day, preceded by two days of preparatory meetings by technical committees. During the meeting, member countries exchanged views on the status of delayed debt negotiations.

A news release issued after the meeting stated that recent opinions and principles proposed by international financial institutions on debt reduction have shown significant progress in understanding external debt issues. However, the confirmed loans are still insufficient to ensure universal progress in debt reduction across the region.

The ministers emphasized that industrialized countries need to review their financial and tax systems, as well as relevant regulations, to facilitate commercial banks and encourage their participation in debt reduction.

The success of debt reduction plans hinges on the widespread participation of commercial banks. However, as of today, the attitude of commercial banks is evidently not proactive enough.

The meeting decided that the next Eight Group meeting will be held in Cancun, Mexico, in September this year.

At a press conference after the meeting, Venezuelan Finance Minister Iturbe, when answering questions, said that the extent of debt reduction should be determined by each country based on its own situation. At the meeting of the Latin American Economic System on debt issues scheduled for June 19, each member country will also decide on its attitude towards the debt proposals made by the organization.

　　拉美八国集团财长讨论债务问题
    本报加拉加斯６月１８日电  记者朱满庭报道：拉美８国集团昨天在这里举行的财长会议要求工业化国家重审有关财政制度，推动商业银行参加减债工作。
    部长级会议进行了一天，此前还举行了两天的技术委员会预备会议。会议中各成员国就延期的债务谈判情况交流了意见。
    会后发表的新闻公报说，最近国际金融机构就减少债务提出的意见和通过的准则表明在对外债问题的认识上取得了重要进展。但目前所确认的贷款还不足以保证整个地区的减债取得普遍进展。
    与会部长强调，工业化国家有必要重审财会制度、税收制度和有关规定，以便对商业银行提供便利，推动它们参加减债。
    减债计划的成功，商业银行的普遍参与是关键性的。而到今天商业银行的态度显然不够积极。
    会议决定，下次８国集团会议今年９月在墨西哥的坎昆举行。
    在会后的记者招待会上，委内瑞拉财长伊图尔贝在回答问题时说，关于债务减少的幅度要由各国根据情况自己确定，在１９日召开的拉美经济体系债务问题会议上，也由各成员国自己决定对该组织提出的债务方案的态度。
