Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 2nd. According to the Beijing Daily, the Beijing Federation of Trade Unions issued a statement on June 1st, strongly demanding the immediate dissolution of the illegal organization known as the "Workers' Autonomous Federation." The full text of the statement is as follows:

In recent days, a small group of people have gathered together, using the name of the working class in Beijing to establish an illegal organization called the "Workers' Autonomous Federation." They spread rumors, distribute leaflets, advocate the overthrow of the people's government, incite strikes, attack public security organs, and claim to establish a "completely independent" "autonomous organization." This is an attempt to split the ranks of the working class and blatantly disrupt the restored normal order in the capital. It fundamentally goes against the will of the working class. The broad masses of workers and trade union cadres cannot tolerate such deliberate actions to create turmoil. The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions solemnly declares: In socialist China, only trade union organizations established in accordance with the "Trade Union Law of the People's Republic of China" and the "Chinese Trade Union Constitution" are genuine social and political organizations representing the interests of the working class. The so-called "Workers' Autonomous Federation" is entirely illegal in its preparation and establishment. We strongly demand that relevant government departments take immediate measures to dissolve the aforementioned illegal organization. Over the past month, the broad masses of workers in the city have shown a high level of political awareness and a sense of responsibility, overcoming numerous difficulties to maintain the production, transportation, living, working, and social order in the capital, making tremendous contributions, and truly being the main force in maintaining stability and unity. The Beijing Federation of Trade Unions hopes that the broad masses of workers and trade union cadres at all levels will heighten their vigilance, distinguish right from wrong, firmly maintain the unity and solidarity of the working class, oppose anyone using the name of the working class to establish any form of illegal organization, guard their posts, and strive for production and work to make new contributions to stabilizing the situation in the capital.

　　北京市总工会发表声明
    要求取缔“工人自治联合会”
    新华社北京６月２日电  据《北京日报》报道，北京市总工会６月１日发表声明，强烈要求赶快取缔非法组织“工人自治联合会”。声明全文如下：
    近日来，社会上一小伙人纠集在一起，盗用本市工人阶级名义，成立所谓“工人自治联合会”的非法组织。他们制造谣言，散发传单，鼓吹推翻人民政府，煽动罢工，冲击公安机关，并声称要建立一个“完全独立”的“自治组织”。这是企图分裂工人阶级队伍，公然破坏正在恢复的首都正常秩序的非法活动，从根本上违背工人阶级的意愿。广大职工和工会干部决不能容忍这种蓄意制造动乱的行为。市总工会严正声明：在社会主义中国，只有按照《中华人民共和国工会法》和《中国工会章程》建立起来的工会组织，才是真正代表工人阶级利益的社会政治团体。上述所谓“工人自治联合会”的筹备和成立都是完全非法的。我们强烈要求政府有关部门立即采取措施，取缔上述非法组织。一个多月来，全市广大职工表现了高度的政治觉悟和主人翁精神，克服重重困难，为维护首都的生产、交通、生活、工作和社会秩序，做出了巨大贡献，不愧是维护安定团结的主力军。市总工会希望广大职工和各级工会干部，提高警惕，明辨是非，坚决维护工人阶级的团结统一，反对任何人盗用工人阶级名义成立任何形式的非法组织，坚守岗位，努力生产和工作，为稳定首都局势作出新的贡献。
