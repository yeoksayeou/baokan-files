Xinhua News Agency, Bangkok, June 13th.

Armed forces of Thailand and Myanmar clashed on June 12 in the border region of Mae Hong Son province in northwestern Thailand. The incident occurred when the Myanmar military attempted to attack Karen ethnic armed groups in the area.

According to local newspaper reports today, the Myanmar military used mortars and machine guns in their offensive. The Thai border guards retaliated and forced them to withdraw from Thai territory.

Reports indicate that last month, the Myanmar military had entered this area during an attack on the Karen ethnic armed groups, resulting in the destruction of 150 homes of Thai border residents.
