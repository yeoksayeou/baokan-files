Recently, Weifang City in Shandong Province has focused on evaluating the performance and integrity of officials, conducting a public democratic evaluation of over 5,500 party and government leaders at the municipal, county, and township levels. This initiative has been warmly welcomed by party members and the general public within the city.

Weifang City's democratic evaluation of party and government leaders began in January this year. To ensure the success of this evaluation, committees were established at both the municipal and county levels, consisting of relevant responsible officials. A total of 459 officials were selected from across the city to form 163 evaluation teams, each responsible for conducting the democratic evaluations. From the municipal party secretary and mayor down to the township party committee secretaries and township heads, everyone publicly reported on their performance. Party members and non-party members from their respective units provided both oral and written evaluations. After thorough discussion and evaluation, an anonymous voting system was used to fill out evaluation forms, providing feedback and suggestions. The results were then publicly announced through either posting them on bulletin boards or announcing them at public meetings within the relevant scope. Over 51,000 party members and non-party members participated in this evaluation.

Weifang City's democratic evaluation of party and government leaders has had a significant impact, yielding noticeable results. First, it has enhanced the sense of responsibility among officials to serve the people. The evaluated leaders unanimously agreed that the democratic evaluation acts like a mirror, reflecting whether they have achieved tangible results during their term. If they fail to do so, they would find it difficult to report their performance and would feel ashamed to face the local people. After the evaluation, the sense of responsibility among leaders has significantly improved. Currently, leaders at the municipal, county, and township levels have all set annual goals. Second, it has strengthened the democratic awareness of leaders and improved relations between officials and the public. Previously, the promotion, demotion, and dismissal of officials were decided by a few departments, leaving the public in the dark. This democratic evaluation has allowed the public to better understand the officials, enabling leaders to hear more comprehensive feedback and demands from the public. This has strengthened mutual understanding, promoted unity between superiors and subordinates, and enhanced the democratic awareness, public service consciousness, and public participation in governance among leaders. During the evaluation process, party members and non-party members provided over 5,370 pieces of feedback, criticism, and suggestions to leaders at various levels. Third, it has broadened the channels for identifying talent, accumulating a reserve of future leaders for the leadership team. Just within the municipal departments, over 110 potential county-level leaders were recommended during this democratic evaluation, providing a reserve of talent for the leadership team. Fourth, it has promoted the ideological and work style construction of the leadership team. The leadership team of the Municipal Bureau of Materials, for instance, previously had coordination issues. During the democratic evaluation, the public sharply pointed out this problem, which deeply affected them. In response, they held a democratic life meeting, with the bureau chief leading a sincere self-criticism and criticism, resolving the misunderstandings.

    潍坊民主考评党政干部
    本报讯  最近，山东省潍坊市以考评干部实绩和廉洁勤政为重点，对５５００多名市、县、乡三级党政领导干部公开进行了民主评议。这一做法，受到了全市党内外干部群众的欢迎。
    潍坊市这次对党政领导干部普遍进行的民主考评，是从今年元月份展开的。为了搞好这次考评，市县两级分别成立了由有关负责同志参加的考评委员会，全市共抽调４５９名干部，组成了１６３个考评小组，具体负责民主考评工作。从市委书记、市长到乡镇党委书记、乡镇长人人公开述职，由所在单位党内外群众进行口头评议和书面评议，在充分酝酿评价的基础上，以无记名方式对领导班子和领导干部填写评价表，提出意见和建议，最后采用张榜公布和大会公布两种方式，在相应范围内公开评议结果。全市５．１万多名党内外群众参加了这次评议。
    潍坊市对党政领导干部实行民主考评，在全市引起了强烈反响，收到了明显效果。第一，增强了干部勤政为民的责任感。被考评的领导干部一致反映，民主考评好像一面镜子，如果任期内不干出实绩来，职就不好述，也就无颜见“江东父老”，太平官当不得了！考评结束后，领导干部普遍提高了责任感。目前，市、县、乡三级领导干部全部制订了年度奋斗目标。第二，强化了领导干部的民主意识，密切了干群关系。过去干部的升降去留，由少数部门“包办”，群众不清楚。这次民主考评，使群众进一步了解了干部，领导比较全面地听到群众的意见和要求，加强了相互理解，促进了上下团结，使领导干部的民主意识、公仆意识和群众参政议政意识得到进一步增强。考评过程中，党内外群众共向各级领导干部提出了５３７０多条意见、批评和建议。第三，拓宽了知人渠道，为领导班子建设积蓄了后秀。仅市直６５个部门，在这次民主考评中就推荐出县级后备干部１１０多名，为领导班子建设积累了后备力量。第四，促进了领导班子的思想作风建设。市物资局领导班子成员，原来工作不够协调，这次民主评议中，群众尖锐地指出了这个问题，使他们触动很大。为此，他们专门召开了民主生活会，局长带头作了诚恳的批评和自我批评，消除了隔阂。
