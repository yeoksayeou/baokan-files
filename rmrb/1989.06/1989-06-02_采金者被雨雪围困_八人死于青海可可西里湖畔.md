Since May, tens of thousands of farmers from eastern Qinghai have been traveling along the Qinghai-Tibet Highway to the western grasslands to mine for gold. Due to heavy rain and snow in the western highlands on May 26, more than 10,000 people, 400 vehicles, and tractors are now stranded near Kokoxili Lake at an altitude of 5,000 meters. Eight people have died due to their inability to adapt to the high-altitude climate.

These gold miners were organized by the provincial gold company. The vehicles left the highway at Chumar River (1,018 kilometers on National Highway 109) and headed northwest towards Kokoxili Lake. Because of the rain and snow, many vehicles got stuck in the mud and could neither move forward nor backward. Many drivers fell ill. By May 31, the snow had melted, and a large number of gold miners set up tents to live in. Currently, the Gelmu City government has organized four tow trucks and bulldozers to go for rescue. The provincial transportation department has also sent leaders with oil, food, and medicine to the scene.

　　采金者被雨雪围困
    八人死于青海可可西里湖畔
    本报西宁６月２日电  记者郅振璞报道：５月以来，青海东部数万农民沿着青藏公路前往西部草原采金。因５月２６日西部高原突降雨雪，至今有万余人、４００辆汽车和手扶拖拉机困于海拔５０００米的可可西里湖畔，已有８人因不适应高原气候而死亡。
    这些采金人员系省黄金公司组织。车辆从格尔木经楚玛尔河（国道１０９线１０１８公里处）离开公路，向西北可可西里湖方向开去。因为雨雪，相当一部分车辆陷入泥坑，无法进退，司机多人患病。５月３１日，积雪已融，大量金农在车房拉开帐篷食宿。目前，格尔木市政府已组织牵引车、推土机４台前往救援，省交通厅也已派领导带油料、食品、药品赶赴现场。
