	Gorbachev to Visit West Germany
	Genscher Foreign Minister Writes Article Supporting Soviet Reform

	Bonn, June 9 (Reported by Jiang Jian Guo) Soviet leader Gorbachev will make an official visit to West Germany on June 12. West Germany attaches great importance to this visit and has made all-round preparations.

	According to local media reports, the two sides will issue a joint statement. The statement will include four parts: the first part will discuss global issues; the second part will focus on the attitudes of both sides towards European peace and cooperation; the third part will discuss disarmament and arms control issues; the last part will be about the future of bilateral relations between West Germany and the Soviet Union. It is reported that this statement will reflect Gorbachev's new thinking.

	The issue of disarmament and arms control will occupy an important position in the bilateral talks. Both sides will discuss the elimination of chemical weapons. It is estimated that Gorbachev may give his first response to President Bush's proposal on conventional weapons reduction in Bonn.

	In terms of bilateral relations, it is reported that both sides have basically reached an agreement on including West Berlin in the scope of bilateral cooperation. Both sides will also discuss the issue of Soviet Germans. A series of bilateral agreements will be signed during the visit.

	In an article written for "Moskovskie Novosti," Foreign Minister Genscher said that the Soviet reform is a manifestation of European reason, and West Germany is willing to support this process. He said that West Germany encourages any reform that leads to more democracy, more diversity, and more freedom. Ideological and military confrontation should be replaced by cooperation, trust, and peaceful competition. Human rights and political freedom should be fully guaranteed.

	Foreign Minister Shevardnadze and Politburo member Yakovlev will accompany Gorbachev on the visit. In addition to political talks, he will also visit Stuttgart, Dortmund, and Dusseldorf.

　　戈尔巴乔夫将出访西德
    根舍外长撰文支持苏联改革
    本报波恩６月９日电  记者江建国报道：苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫将于６月１２日对西德进行正式访问。西德高度重视这次访问，已经作好各方面准备工作。
    据此间报刊报道，西德苏联双方将发表一份联合声明。这个声明包括四个部分：第一部分将谈及全球问题；第二部分将重点表明双方对欧洲和平合作的态度；第三部分谈裁军和军备控制问题；最后一部分是关于西德苏联双边关系的未来。据悉，这个声明将反映戈尔巴乔夫的新思维。
    裁军和军备控制问题将在双边会谈中占重要地位。双方将讨论消除化学武器问题，估计戈尔巴乔夫可能在波恩对布什总统的常规武器裁军建议作出首次回答。
    在双边关系方面，据悉双方已就西柏林纳入双边合作范围基本达成一致。双方还将讨论苏联的德国后裔居民问题。一系列双边协议将在访问时签署。
    根舍外长在为《莫斯科新闻》所写的文章中说，苏联的改革是一种欧洲理智的表现，西德愿意支持这一进程。他说，西德鼓励任何导致更多的民主，更多的多样性和更多的自由的改革。意识形态和军事的对立应该由合作、信任和和平竞赛来代替，人权和政治自由应该得到完全的保证。
    谢瓦尔德纳泽外长和苏共中央政治局委员雅可夫列夫将陪同戈尔巴乔夫访问。除进行政治会谈外，他还将访问斯图加特、多特蒙德和杜塞尔多夫等地。
