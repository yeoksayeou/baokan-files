A responsible person from the Public Security Border Defense Bureau recently stated that recently, tourist ships engaging in gambling activities have been found in the waters of the South China Sea. The Chinese government has long had clear regulations prohibiting gambling within the territory of the People's Republic of China (including its waters). The Public Security Border Defense Bureau has notified relevant provincial public security border defense departments to dispatch maritime patrol boats for surveillance. Once any tourist ship is found setting up gambling operations in our waters, it will be immediately expelled and shut down.
