Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain, Qatar, and Oman are located along the southwestern coast of the Gulf. The total population of these six countries is approximately 17 million, with a combined area of 2.59 million square kilometers. All six countries are rich in oil, with an annual production of about 420 million tons, accounting for 40% of the world's oil reserves. The six countries share a common religious belief, similar political systems and economic structures, belong to the same ethnic group, and speak the same language.

To maintain peace and stability in the Gulf region and accelerate economic cooperation and development, the heads of state of the six countries formally announced the establishment of the Gulf Cooperation Council in Abu Dhabi on May 25, 1981.

The Gulf Cooperation Council is a regional cooperation organization that integrates politics, economics, and military affairs. It has three main institutions: the Supreme Council, the Ministerial Council, and the Secretariat. The headquarters is located in Riyadh, the capital of Saudi Arabia.

The Supreme Council is the highest authority, with the main responsibilities of formulating the overall policies and basic principles of the cooperation council; reviewing and approving the recommendations, reports, and various regulations submitted by the Ministerial Council and the Secretariat; and amending the charter of the cooperation council.

The main responsibilities of the Ministerial Council are to implement the resolutions made by the Supreme Council; promote cooperation and coordination among member countries in various aspects; and propose recommendations and research reports on cooperation and coordination.

To strengthen economic cooperation among the six countries and achieve economic integration, the cooperation council has taken the following important steps in recent years: In 1981, the cooperation council adopted the Unified Economic Agreement; in 1983, it established the Gulf Investment Company; in 1984 and 1985, the Gulf Cooperation Council respectively adopted the common goals and policies for development plans, common agricultural policies, and unified industrial development strategies. These steps are of crucial significance for improving the economic development environment of the six countries.

Since its establishment, the Gulf Cooperation Council has gradually moved from bilateral and multilateral cooperation to integration, with the scope of cooperation expanding from partial to comprehensive. Dependence on Western countries will gradually decrease. The establishment of the Gulf Cooperation Council not only sets a banner of unity and cooperation for the Arab world but also provides a broad market for Arab countries, further strengthening economic ties with Arab countries.

　　一面团结合作的旗帜——
    海湾合作委员会
    倪星源
    沙特阿拉伯、科威特、阿拉伯联合酋长国、巴林、卡塔尔和阿曼六国位于海湾西南沿岸，总人口约一千七百万，面积二百五十九万平方公里。六国都盛产石油，年产量约四点二亿吨，石油储量占世界石油储量百分之四十。六国有着共同的宗教信仰，相似的政治体制和经济结构，属同一个民族，操同一种语言。
    为了维护海湾地区的和平和稳定，加快经济合作与开发，一九八一年五月二十五日六国首脑在阿布扎比正式宣告海湾合作委员会诞生。
    海湾合作委员会是集政治、经济、军事于一体的区域性合作组织。它设有三个主要机构：最高理事会，部长理事会和秘书处。总部设在沙特阿拉伯首都利雅得。
    最高理事会是最高权力机构，其主要职责：制定合作委员会的总方针和基本政策；审议和批准部长理事会和秘书处提请采纳的建议、报告和各项条例；修改合作委员会章程。
    部长理事会的主要职责是：贯彻最高理事会作出的有关决议；推动成员国在各个方面的合作与协调；提出有关合作与协调方面的建议和研究报告。
    为了加强六国经济合作，实现经济一体化，合作委员会近年来采取了下列几个重要步骤：一九八一年合作委员会通过了统一经济协定；一九八三年建立了海湾投资公司；一九八四年和一九八五年海湾合作委员会分别通过了发展计划的共同目标与政策、共同农业政策和统一工业发展战略。这些步骤对于改善六国经济发展环境具有至关重要的意义。
    海湾合作委员会成立以来，经济合作从过去的双边和多边合作逐步向一体化迈进，合作领域从局部扩大到全面，对西方国家的依赖将逐步减少。海湾合作委员会的建立不仅为阿拉伯世界树立了一面团结、合作的旗帜，而且也为阿拉伯国家提供了广阔市场，进一步加强了同阿拉伯国家的经济联系。
