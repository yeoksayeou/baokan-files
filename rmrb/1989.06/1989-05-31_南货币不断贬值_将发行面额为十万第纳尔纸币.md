Xinhua News Agency, Belgrade, May 31st.

	Yugoslavia's currency continues to depreciate, and the National Bank of Yugoslavia will start circulating 100,000 dinar banknotes on June 1st. This is a result of the country's rapid price increases and significant currency devaluation.

	According to official statistics, since the 1980s, the exchange rate of the dinar against convertible currencies has been continuously declining. At the end of 1981, 1 US dollar could be exchanged for 41.8 dinars. By the end of 1988, 1 US dollar could be exchanged for over 5,000 dinars. The dinar depreciated by 293% in 1988 alone. Currently, 1 US dollar can be exchanged for 14,400 dinars, with an even more astonishing depreciation rate. Previously, the prices of goods were generally calculated in hundreds or thousands of dinars, but now they are calculated in tens of millions or even hundreds of millions of dinars.

　　南货币不断贬值
    将发行面额为十万第纳尔纸币
    本报贝尔格莱德５月３１日电  记者严正报道：由南人民银行发行的面额为１０万第纳尔的纸币６月１日开始投入使用，这实际上是南斯拉夫物价猛涨、货币大幅度贬值的产物。
    据南官方统计，８０年代开始南斯拉夫与可兑换外币的比值不断下降，１９８１年底１美元只能兑换４１．８第纳尔，到１９８８年底１美元可兑换５０００多第纳尔。第纳尔在去年贬值了２９３％。而目前１美元可兑换１４４００第纳尔，贬值的幅度更为惊人。以前商品的价格一般以百第纳尔和千第纳尔计算，现在要以几十万甚至数百万第纳尔计算。
