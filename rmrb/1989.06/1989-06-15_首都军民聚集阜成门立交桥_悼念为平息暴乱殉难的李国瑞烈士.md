    据新华社北京６月１５日电  中国人民解放军总参谋部、首都戒严部队指挥部、武警总部、海军机关、航空航天部第５研究院及首都各界群众今天纷纷到阜成门立交桥悼念在平息反革命暴乱中殉难的武警战士李国瑞。
    从上午１０点开始，自发来悼念李国瑞烈士的群众成千上万，络绎不绝。北京市政工程研究所３００名职工每人扎了一朵白花做成花圈。北礼士路第一小学３００名少先队员把自己扎的白花系在桥栏杆上。一位中年妇女含着眼泪献上一朵用白绸扎成的花，上面写着“革命烈士永垂不朽。”
    上午１１点２０分，中国人民解放军总参谋部、首都戒严部队指挥部部分同志来到桥上，代表总参、戒严部队指挥部首长和全体官兵向李国瑞烈士表示深切哀悼。
    武警总部机关的同志在副司令员范志伦的带领下来到桥上，在哀乐声中，向死难烈士献了花圈。
    下午３点多钟，一位姓王的老大娘在烈士遗像前鞠躬致哀，失声痛哭，她说：“这个战士太可惜了，还不如我替这位战士死啊！暴徒们也太凶狠了，一定要把他们逮住，知情的群众啊，你们要揭发他们，为这位战士报仇。”
