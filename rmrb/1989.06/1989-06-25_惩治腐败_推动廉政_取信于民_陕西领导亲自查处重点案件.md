To punish corruption, promote clean government, and gain public trust, the Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government recently decided that provincial-level leaders will personally handle the investigation of key cases. Provincial Party Secretary Zhang Boxing and Governor Hou Zongbin, along with 24 other provincial-level leaders, have already begun investigating the first batch of 22 key cases.

Since the rectification campaign began, the number of cases investigated in Shaanxi Province has surged. However, due to the complexity of some cases, difficulties in determining their nature, interference from influential figures, or lack of coordination among investigators, the investigation process has been slow, making it difficult to conclude cases. To accelerate the quality and speed of case handling, it is imperative for provincial-level leaders to personally handle key cases.

The Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have decided that the Provincial Party Committee's secretaries and deputy secretaries, standing committee members, provincial government's governors and deputy governors, provincial discipline inspection commission's secretaries and deputy secretaries, as well as relevant leaders from the Provincial Advisory Committee, Provincial People's Congress, and Provincial People's Political Consultative Conference, will each be responsible for overseeing the investigation of one key case. During the investigation, they will timely listen to case reports, coordinate investigation forces, strictly adhere to party discipline, government discipline, legal procedures, and economic supervision department's investigation procedures, and ensure that the disciplinary and law enforcement agencies independently handle cases and act in accordance with the law and discipline. Based on the investigation of the problems, they will strive to handle party discipline, government discipline, and legal procedures simultaneously, ensuring that the cases can withstand historical scrutiny. The decision also states that cases handled by provincial-level leaders should involve party and government officials, especially county and department-level leaders who abuse power, engage in speculation, embezzlement, and bribery, as well as cases that have a significant impact on society. Each case should be registered and filed, forming a system, and proceeding in batches.

The first batch of 24 cases handled by provincial-level leaders are among the most influential and challenging cases in the province. On the afternoon of the 20th, Provincial Party Secretary Zhang Boxing and Governor Hou Zongbin took the lead in convening investigation personnel to study and deploy the investigation of a case involving a cadre demanding a bribe of 250,000 yuan and a major case involving the resale of over 3,700 color televisions, accelerating the investigation speed. Other provincial-level leaders have also studied the cases they are responsible for, striving to conclude these cases before National Day.

　　惩治腐败　推动廉政　取信于民    
    陕西领导亲自查处重点案件
    本报西安６月２５日电  记者孟西安报道：为了惩治腐败，推动廉政建设，日前，陕西省委、省政府做出了省级领导干部亲自动手查处案件的决定。省委书记张勃兴、省长侯宗宾等２４名省级领导已着手查处第一批２２件重点案件。
    治理整顿以来，陕西省立案查处的案件猛增。但由于一些案件或因案情复杂，难以定性；或因后面有人从中作梗，阻力较大；或因办案者相互推诿，难以协调，致使查处工作迟缓难以结案。为了加快办案质量和速度，省级领导干部亲手查处重点案件势在必行。
    省委、省政府决定：省委正副书记、常委，省政府正副省长，省纪委正副书记以及省顾委、省人大、省政协有关领导同志，每人定期负责抓好一起重点案件的查处。在查案中，要及时听取案情汇报、协调办案力量，严格遵守党纪、政纪、法纪和经济监督部门的办案程序，坚持执纪执法部门独立办案，依法依纪办事；在查清问题的基础上，力争党纪、政纪、法纪同时处理，确保办案经得起历史的检验。决定还指出，省级领导亲自动手查处的案件，应是涉及党政干部，特别是县处级以上领导干部弄权渎职、投机倒把、贪污受贿，以及在社会上有较大影响的案件；要逐案登记、立卡，形成制度，分期分批地进行下去。
    省级领导着手查处的第一批２４个案件，就是在全省影响较大、难度较高的案件。２０日下午，省委书记张勃兴、省长侯宗宾已率先分别召集办案人员，就自己分管抓的部分干部２５万元索贿案和倒卖３７００多台彩电的特大案件，进行了研究和部署，加快了办案速度。其他省级领导也相继就自己分管的案件进行了研究，力争国庆节前将这些案件查清了结。
