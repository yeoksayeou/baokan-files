Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 27th.

The Central Propaganda Department's Education Bureau today convened a group of leaders and teachers from the capital's education system to discuss learning the spirit of the Party's Thirteenth Plenum of the Fourth Session and how to strengthen ideological and political work in schools.

Guo Jinghai, Deputy Secretary of the Beijing University Party Committee, said, "We in the school system have long felt that this year would be difficult because some people have been using university platforms to promote their political views. The essence of their views is to oppose the Party's leadership and the socialist system. Zhao Ziyang's passive attitude towards adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization has weakened ideological and political work. This is why bourgeois liberalization has spread widely, while the propagation of Marxism has been under attack."

Professor Lin Tai from Tsinghua University said, "The Party's Thirteenth Plenum of the Fourth Session has resolved a hidden danger within the central leadership. The turmoil developed into a counter-revolutionary rebellion, and it took a significant toll to quell it because there were problems within the central leadership. It is completely correct for the Fourth Plenum to list the serious strengthening of ideological and political work as one of the four major tasks that need special attention at present. In implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenum, the most important thing is to reflect. First, strengthening ideological and political work should be broad in scope, not just school education, but also the entire ideological realm, including the media, academic circles, the publishing industry, and the education sector. Second, we need to reflect on the training objectives of our schools. What kind of successors are we training, and how do we do a good job of training them?"

Professor Xi Guangqing from Renmin University of China said, "The Party's Thirteenth Plenum of the Fourth Session will become a new starting point for ideological and political work in the new era. Strengthening ideological and political work is not just the work of one particular sector; it is the work of the entire Party. At the same time, strengthening ideological and political work means comprehensively educating students, including Marxist basic views, China's history and reality, and legal and disciplinary concepts, with the core being Marxism."

Tong Xiao, a researcher from the Central Propaganda Department, said, "This incident reflects that there is indeed a struggle for the hearts and minds of the youth. If we do not occupy various platforms, the enemy will. For a period of time, we who propagate Marxism have felt a lack of support and felt constrained. In fact, the weakening of ideological and political work over the past few years has cultivated a group of gravediggers rather than successors for our cause in the schools, and the problem is very serious. The convening of the Fourth Plenum and Deng Xiaoping's important speech have given us great encouragement. We have the confidence to do a good job of ideological and political work."

### 中宣部教育局召集教育工作者座谈四中全会精神  思想政治工作是全党的工作

　　中宣部教育局召集教育工作者座谈四中全会精神    
    思想政治工作是全党的工作
    据新华社北京６月２７日电  中宣部教育局今天召集首都教育系统部分领导干部和教师，座谈学习党的十三届四中全会精神，讨论如何加强学校思想政治工作。
    北京大学党委副书记郭景海说，我们做学校工作的同志早就预感今年的日子不好过，因为有些人很早就开始作文章，千方百计利用大学的讲坛鼓吹自己的政治主张，他们的观点的实质就是反对党的领导，反对社会主义制度。赵紫阳同志消极对待坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的方针，导致了思想政治工作的削弱。正因为如此，资产阶级自由化的东西大肆泛滥，而宣传马克思主义则遭到围攻。
    清华大学教授林泰说，党的十三届四中全会解决了中央领导层里的一个隐患。这次学潮发展到动乱，又发展到反革命暴乱，之所以付出较大代价才平息，就是因为中央领导层里出了问题。四中全会把认真加强思想政治工作列为当前要特别注意抓好的四件大事之一是完全正确的。我们贯彻四中全会的精神，最主要的是要进行反思。第一，加强思想政治工作应是广义的，不仅是学校教育，而且应包括整个思想意识形态，新闻界、理论界、出版界、教育界等；第二，要认真反思一下我们学校的培养目标，我们到底要培养什么样的接班人，以及如何做好培养人的工作。
    中国人民大学教授奚广庆说，党的十三届四中全会将成为新时期思想政治工作的新起点，加强思想政治工作，不是单独哪一个方面的工作，而是全党的工作；同时，加强思想政治工作，就要全面地对学生进行教育，包括马克思主义基本观点、中国的历史和现实、法制纪律观念，而核心是马克思主义。
    中宣部调研员曲啸说，这次事件反映出，在青年人身上确实存在着夺人夺魂的斗争，各种各样的讲坛我们不去占领，敌对分子就会占领，而一段时间以来，我们这些宣传马克思主义的同志感到缺少支持，感觉受到约束。事实上，几年来思想政治工作的削弱，使得在学校中培养了一批我们事业的掘墓人，而不是接班人，问题是非常严重的。四中全会的召开和邓小平同志的重要讲话给我们很大鼓舞，我们有信心把思想政治工作做好。
