Changzhou, Jiangsu, has launched a special tax inspection targeting individual taxpayers, including self-employed individuals, renters, and those subject to the personal income adjustment tax. Over three months, the inspection uncovered 151.5 million yuan in unpaid taxes, with 60% of this amount already collected.

The inspection revealed widespread and serious tax evasion among individual taxpayers: first, the scope of evasion is broad, affecting over 80% of the inspected key households; second, the amounts evaded are substantial, with over 150 households owing more than 100,000 yuan each, and one household owing as much as 380,000 yuan; third, the methods of evasion are diverse and numerous, totaling over a dozen, with some self-employed individuals openly declaring, “Eat tax money, make tax profits, enjoy tax benefits.”

During the inspection, Changzhou adhered to policies and enforced tax laws strictly. Law-abiding and compliant taxpayers were protected and encouraged to develop further, while illegal operations and tax evaders were firmly stopped and severely punished.
