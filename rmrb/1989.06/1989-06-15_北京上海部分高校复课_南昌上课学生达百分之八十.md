	Some universities in Beijing and Shanghai have resumed classes. Over 80% of students in Nanchang are attending classes.

	Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 14 - It was learned today from relevant departments that some universities in Beijing have resumed classes.

	According to reports, Beijing Youth Political College resumed classes on the 13th, with a student attendance rate of 90%. Among the 13 affiliated colleges of Beijing United University, five have seen a significant number of students return to classes. Beijing Education College and Beijing Education Administration College also resumed classes on the 12th. Beijing's relevant departments have requested that all other municipal universities fully resume classes.

	Universities under the central ministries and commissions have, according to the Ministry of Education's notice and the actual situation of the schools, carefully studied and arranged the defense of theses, graduation assessments, allocations, and teaching work for graduating students. They have also requested that students who have left school to return home quickly return to school to resume classes.

	Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 15 - Most municipal and specialized universities in Shanghai have resumed classes, and the teaching order is normal. Over 30,000 graduating students in various universities in the city are mostly in school working on their graduation designs and theses. This is the information obtained by reporters today from the Shanghai Municipal Education Bureau.

	According to statistics from relevant departments on the resumption of classes in 33 universities, 24 have basically resumed classes. Among them, Shanghai Second Medical University, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, Shanghai Normal University, Shanghai Institute of Technology, Shanghai Agricultural College, Shanghai University of Engineering Technology, and 19 other universities have student attendance rates of over 90%. The School of Business Administration, the School of International Business, and five other affiliated colleges of Shanghai University have seen most students return to classes, and the attendance rate of the School of Literature has reached 70%.

	It is understood that the graduation allocation work of Shanghai universities this year will be carried out as scheduled in July. The examination dates for ordinary universities have been set for early July, with a ratio of examinees to planned enrollment of 1:1.93, roughly the same as last year.

	Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, June 15 - Today, 13 universities in the Nanchang region have fully resumed classes, with students attending classes reaching 80% of the total number of students.

	For more than two months, due to the instigation and creation of turmoil by a small number of people, the teaching and living order of universities in the Nanchang region have been disrupted. Especially after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, the leaders of the illegal organization "Provincial Autonomous Federation of University Students" spread rumors and incited students to "vacate the campus" and return home, causing some students to leave school. Through the efforts of various universities and relevant departments, students who left school have gradually returned to resume classes. The student attendance rates of Jiangxi Agricultural University and four other universities are close to or have reached 100%; the student attendance rates of Jiangxi University, Jiangxi University of Technology, Jiangxi Medical College, and Jiangxi College of Traditional Chinese Medicine are also around 90%.

　　北京上海部分高校复课
    南昌上课学生达百分之八十
    新华社北京六月十四日电  记者今天从有关部门获悉，北京已有一些高校复课。
    据介绍，北京青年政治学院已于十三日复课，学生到课率达百分之九十。北京联合大学下属十三所院校中，有五所院校的大部分学生复课。北京教育学院、北京教育行政学院也于十二日基本复课。北京市有关部门已要求市属其它院校全面复课。
    中央部委所属院校按照国家教委的通知和学校实际情况，对毕业生的论文答辩、毕业考核以及分配和教学工作进行了认真的研究和安排，并要求离校回家的学生迅速返校复课。
    据新华社上海六月十五日电　上海大多数市属高校和专科学校已经复课，教学秩序正常。全市各高校的三万余名毕业班学生绝大多数正在学校进行毕业设计、毕业论文的写作。这是记者今天从上海市高教局获得的信息。
    据有关部门对三十三所高校复课情况的统计，有二十四所已基本复课。其中，上海第二医科大学、上海中医学院、上海师范大学、上海技术师院、上海农学院、上海工程技术大学等十九所高校，学生上课率都已达到百分之九十以上。上海大学下属的工商管理学院、国际商业学院等五所院校，绝大多数学生已复课，文学院的上课率也达到了百分之七十。
    据悉，今年上海高校的毕业分配工作将按期于七月份进行。普通高校的考试日期已定于七月上旬举行，考生数与计划招生数比例为一比一点九三，大体上与去年的情况持平。
    新华社南昌六月十五日电　今天南昌地区十三所高校全面复课，上课学生已达学生总数的百分之八十。
    两个多月来，由于极少数人煽动制造动乱，南昌地区高校教学、生活秩序受到冲击。特别是北京平息反革命暴乱后，非法组织“省高自联”的头头散布谣言，鼓动学生“空校”返乡，致使一部分学生离校。经过各高校和有关部门的努力，离校学生陆续返校复课，江西农业大学等四所高校学生上课接近或达到百分之一百；江西大学、江西工业大学、江西医学院、江西中医学院四所高校的学生上课率也在百分之九十左右。
