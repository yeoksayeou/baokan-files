A retired Chinese-American professor at Columbia University, Wang Jizhen, today published an article in The New York Times supporting China's measures to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

The article states that there is no doubt that recently in China, a small group of people instigated demonstrations and unrest. Their goal is to overthrow the current government and establish what appears to be the "democratic capitalist system" that is currently popular in the world.

The article points out that China's current government is the only effective and stable government in China this century. Before the situation becomes completely out of control and the government is threatened, the leaders of the Communist Party of China have the responsibility to suppress any counter-revolutionary movements to defend the system established after decades of struggle.

The article emphasizes that the student movement escalated into unrest, disrupting traffic, setting vehicles on fire, and ultimately even injuring soldiers. In this situation, it is extremely unreasonable to expect the lawfully established Chinese government to yield to these illegal actions, as some American media outlets have suggested.

The article concludes that the 40 years of rule by the Communist Party of China have been a period of unprecedented progress and relative prosperity for China. Although the living standards are not high, there is basically no hunger. To my knowledge, the living standards of the vast majority of Chinese people in these 40 years have been better than in any other period. It is not difficult to predict that the majority of the people want to maintain the current regime.

    支持我平息反革命暴乱
    本报纽约６月２４日电  记者刘开宸报道：美国哥伦比亚大学退休的美籍华人教授王际真今天在《纽约时报》发表文章，支持中国政府平息反革命暴乱的措施。
    文章说，毫无疑问，最近在中国，一小撮人煽动示威游行和动乱。其目的在于推翻现政府，建立一个似乎是现在世界上流行的“民主的资本主义制度”。
    文章指出，中国现在的政府是中国本世纪里唯一有效能和稳定的政府，在它受到威胁、局势完全失控之前，为了保卫经过几十年斗争才建立起来的这个制度，中国共产党的领导人有责任镇压任何反革命运动。
    文章强调，学运扩大为动乱，破坏交通、放火烧毁车辆，最后甚至杀伤士兵。在这种情况下，还要像美国宣传媒介所期望的那样，让合法建立的中国政府向这些非法的行为屈服，那是非常不合理的。
    文章最后指出，中国共产党４０年的统治是中国取得空前进步和比较繁荣的时期，生活水平还不高，但基本上无饥饿。据我所知，绝大多数中国人民在这４０年中的生活比过去任何一个时期都好，不难预测，绝大多数人民是要保持现在的政权的。
