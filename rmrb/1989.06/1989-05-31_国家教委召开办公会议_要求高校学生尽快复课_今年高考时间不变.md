The State Education Commission held an office meeting on May 29, analyzing the current situation in higher education institutions, and discussing issues related to this year's enrollment, graduate allocation, and ensuring that students complete their studies on time. The meeting proposed that students in higher education institutions should resume classes as soon as possible.

The meeting noted that since mid-April, students in some higher education institutions across the country have gone on strike and participated in demonstrations, which have affected their studies to varying degrees. The allocation and dispatch of this year's graduates and the enrollment process are imminent. If the current situation continues, it will bring serious difficulties to the allocation and dispatch of graduates, and may even prevent the planned enrollment of more than 600,000 new students this year from proceeding on schedule. If this happens, the normal teaching order in higher education institutions will be disrupted, causing irreparable losses to both the state and the students.

In analyzing the current situation in higher education institutions, the meeting believed that most students are willing to resume classes as soon as possible. Many students and their families have recently written letters or called the State Education Commission, hoping to restore the normal teaching order in higher education institutions as soon as possible. Completing their studies on time and graduating on time have become issues of widespread concern among college students. In the previous period, when the normal teaching order in some higher education institutions was disrupted, some institutions still insisted on holding classes, and the vast majority of graduating students continued to complete their graduation designs and theses. Most higher education institutions in Yunnan, Anhui, Hunan, and Heilongjiang have resumed classes. In various regions, many students have insisted on attending classes normally. They have demonstrated their patriotism through their diligent studies. These students also have a strong desire to eliminate corruption and advance the democratic process, but they advocate that these issues should be resolved through democratic and legal channels under the leadership of the Party and the government.

To minimize the loss of students' studies, the meeting proposed that relevant higher education institutions should resume classes as soon as possible. Each higher education institution should, based on the specific circumstances of different grades and majors, make full use of the remaining time in this semester, plan comprehensively, and arrange reasonably. Under the premise of strict requirements and ensuring teaching quality, non-graduating students who have suffered significant losses in their studies may have their teaching plans adjusted appropriately. Graduating students this year, including those in master's, undergraduate, and specialized programs, should seize the time to complete their graduation designs and theses as required by the predetermined teaching plan, conduct thesis defenses and evaluate their grades seriously, and graduate on schedule without lowering the basic requirements. The timing of this year's college entrance examination will remain unchanged.

　　国家教委召开办公会议
    要求高校学生尽快复课
    今年高考时间不变
    新华社北京５月３１日电  据国家教委新闻宣传处消息：国家教委于５月２９日召开办公会议，分析了当前高等学校的形势，研究了今年高等学校的招生、毕业生分配工作和在校学生按时完成学业等问题。会议提出，高等学校学生应该尽快复课。
    会议认为，自４月中旬以来，全国一些高等学校学生因罢课、游行，不同程度地影响了学业。今年高等学校毕业生分配派遣工作、招生工作在即，如果目前的情况再继续下去，就会给毕业生的分配派遣带来严重困难，甚至有可能使今年计划招收的６０多万新生不能按时进入高等学校。如出现这种情况，整个高等学校的正常教学秩序就会被打乱，从而给国家和学生本人造成难以弥补的损失。
    在分析当前高等学校的形势时，会议认为，大部分学生是愿意尽早复课的。不少学生及家长最近纷纷给国家教委写信或打电话，希望尽快恢复高等学校的正常教学秩序。按时完成学业，按时毕业，已成为大学生普遍关注的问题。在前一时期一些高等学校正常教学秩序被打乱的情况下，仍有一些高等学校坚持上课，毕业班的绝大部分学生也在坚持完成预定的毕业设计和毕业论文。云南、安徽、湖南、黑龙江等地的大部分高等学校的学生已经复课。各地高校都有不少学生坚持正常上课。他们以刻苦学习的行动，体现出爱国之心。这些学生同样有消除腐败、推进民主进程的强烈愿望，但他们主张这些问题要在党和政府的领导下，通过民主和法制的轨道来解决。
    为了尽量减少学生在学业上的损失，会议提出，各有关高等学校应尽快复课。各高等学校应根据不同年级、不同专业的具体情况，充分利用本学期的剩余时间，统筹考虑，合理安排。在严格要求、保证教学质量的前提下，对学业损失较大的非毕业班学生可适当调整教学计划。今年毕业的研究生、本专科生，应抓紧时间，力求按预定教学计划要求完成毕业设计、毕业论文，认真进行答辩和评定成绩等工作，在不降低基本要求的情况下如期毕业。今年的高考时间不变。
