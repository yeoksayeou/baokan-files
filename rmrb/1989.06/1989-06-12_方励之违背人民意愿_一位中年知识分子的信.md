Fang Lizhi Goes Against the Will of the People
— A Letter from a Middle-Aged Intellectual

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 12 — According to relevant departments, a middle-aged intellectual wrote a letter to relevant departments. The content of the letter is as follows:

I am a middle-aged intellectual. I used to teach at a university and now work in a research institute. I was also a graduate student and obtained a master's degree. Now I would like to talk about Fang Lizhi and say a few words to the young students.

In this counter-revolutionary riot, Fang Lizhi was one of the main instigators. Fang Lizhi, along with a very small number of people, used some students (excluding the thugs among the students) as hostages and political chips to create chaos, incite riots, and attempt to disrupt the entire country. They aimed to seize power amidst the chaos and overthrow the People's Republic of China, but you failed because you went against the will of the people and underestimated the power of the people. You fled to an embassy. When the students were on a hunger strike, you did not participate; when bloodshed occurred, you did not shed any blood. You abandoned your accomplices and the people you deceived and incited, hiding in an embassy. What kind of hero are you? A writer said you, Fang Lizhi, are a traitor, and I think that is very accurate. I say you are a traitor with no courage or backbone. Saying you have no courage because you fled, and saying you have no backbone because you hid in a foreign embassy. Is that not correct, Fang Lizhi? I believe that not only the broad masses of the people, but also those who do not understand the current situation, and even your accomplices and those deceived by you, at least on this point, will not have much disagreement!

Fang Lizhi has long considered himself a representative of intellectuals. I have also "read" some of your statements since 1986. Later, you went further and further astray. I and more and more intellectuals have come to a deeper understanding of you, and now we have completely understood you. You are not just a dissident, you are a political conspirator, a plotter, a subversive of the People's Republic of China, a traitor. You can only deceive and incite some young students because, in my circle, many intellectuals, including old, middle-aged, and young intellectuals, have clearly opposed your views and actions in their daily conversations before this counter-revolutionary riot.

Here, I also want to say a few words to the young students. Because I am also from a student background and have taught university students. In the 10 years of reform and opening up, I have had opinions on some mistakes and policies of the government, such as mistakes in education, unfair distribution to intellectuals, the issue of "official profiteering," the issue of prices, and even more specifically, the issue of professional titles for middle-aged intellectuals who have made contributions and have waited for many years. But I believe that these problems can only be solved through legal channels, through true democratic methods, and not through other methods, not through methods of overthrowing the government. Because if the country is in chaos, then no problem can be solved, and in the end, the direct victims will still be the broad masses of the people, including us intellectuals. I believe that some young students have patriotic aspirations, but I also think that your understanding of "patriotism" is shallow, and your thoughts are confused. Some young students do not truly understand China's history, do not understand China's past and present, and do not truly understand the intentions and tricks of various countries and forces in the world. With the development of the situation, you should realize that you do not want to engage in beating, smashing, looting, burning, and killing, but someone wants to engage in beating, smashing, looting, burning, and killing; you do not want to overthrow the People's Republic of China, but a very small number of people do want to overthrow the People's Republic of China. This has been proven by the facts, and it is not something that can be changed by the will of young students. A very small number of people use the mistakes in reform and opening up, use the so-called "hot" issues of the masses to confuse people, create chaos, and achieve their unspoken political purposes, which is to overthrow the People's Republic of China. Young students, think carefully about your historical responsibility to the nation and the country! Do not be used as a tool by a small number of ambitious plotters to achieve their political purposes! The hearts of the people are settled, and the will of the people is settled. Please consider the hearts of the people and the will of the people when you do things.

### 方励之违背人民意愿——一位中年知识分子的信

　　方励之违背人民意愿
    ——一位中年知识分子的信
    新华社北京６月１２日电  据有关部门提供：一位中年知识分子给有关部门写了一封信，信件内容如下：
    我是一位中年知识分子，曾经在大学里任过教，现在科研机关做研究工作。我也曾是研究生，获得了硕士学位。现在我想谈谈方励之，并对青年学生讲几句话。
    这次反革命暴乱，方励之是主要煽动者之一。方励之伙同极少数人，拿一些学生（学生中的歹徒除外）做人质，做政治赌注，制造动乱，煽动暴乱，妄图搞乱全国，乱中夺权，颠覆中华人民共和国，可是你失败了，因为违背人民的意愿，低估了人民的力量。你溜了，溜到外国大使馆去了。当初学生绝食的时候，你没有绝食；在发生流血事件时，你没有流血，你抛开你的同伙，抛开被你蒙蔽煽动的一些人，躲到外国大使馆去了，你算哪门子的英雄好汉？！一位作家说你方励之是卖国贼，我看说得很准确。我说你是一点勇气、一点骨气都没有的卖国贼。说你没有勇气，因为你溜了，说你没有骨气，因为你溜到外国使馆去了。说得不对吗？方励之。我相信，不仅广大人民群众，包括对目前形势不理解的人，甚至你的同伙和被你们蒙蔽的一些人，至少在这一点看法上不会有多大分歧吧！
    方励之长期以知识分子的代表自居，我也曾经“拜读”过你自１９８６年以来的一些言论。后来，你越走越远。我和越来越多的知识分子也就越来越深刻地认识了你，到现在算彻底地认识了你。你哪仅是一个持不同政见者，你是一个政治野心家阴谋家，你是一个颠覆中华人民共和国的颠覆分子，是一个卖国贼。你只能蒙蔽煽动一些青年学生，因为在我周围的许多知识分子，包括老、中、青三个年龄段的知识分子，就在这次反革命暴乱之前，在日常的言论中，都明确反对你的观点，反对你的所作所为。
    在这里，我也想和青年学生讲几句话。因为我也是学生出身的人，也曾教过大学生。在１０年改革开放过程中，我对政府的一些失误和政策也有过意见，例如对教育问题上的失误，对知识分子的分配不公，对“官倒”问题，对物价问题，甚至说细一点，对有贡献、年头也熬到了的中年知识分子的职称问题等等，但我认为，这些问题只能通过法制的轨道来解决，通过真正的民主的方法来解决，而不能通过别的方法来解决，不能通过颠覆政府的方法来解决。因为国家乱了，那就什么问题也解决不了，到头来直接受害的还是广大人民群众，包括我们知识分子。我是相信一些青年学生有爱国愿望的，但我同时认为你们中的一些人对“爱国”的认识是肤浅的，思想是混乱的。一些青年学生并不真正了解中国的历史，不了解中国的过去与现在，也不真正了解世界各国以及世界上各种势力的意图和阴谋诡计。随着形势的发展，你们应该认识到，你不想搞打、砸、抢、烧、杀，有人想搞打、砸、抢、烧、杀；你不想颠覆中华人民共和国，极少数人就是想颠覆中华人民共和国。这是事实证明了的，是不以青年学生的意志为转移的。极少数人利用改革开放中的失误，利用群众所谓“热点”问题蛊惑人心，制造动乱，以达到他们不可告人的政治目的，也就是颠覆中华人民共和国的目的。青年学生们，好好考虑一下自己对民族对国家的历史责任吧！别被极少数野心家阴谋家当作达到他们政治目的工具使用吧！人心是思定的，民心是思定的，请你们在做事的时候要考虑人心、民心。　　　
　　　　　　　１９８９年６月１０日
