China's Deputy Representative to the United Nations, Ding Yuanhong, today called on the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) to continue providing more and more flexible aid to developing countries based on the global population situation and the specific needs and priority areas of developing countries, so as to play a greater role in solving population problems.

Ding Yuanhong made the remarks at the 36th session of the Executive Board of the United Nations Development Programme on the issue of the UNFPA. He pointed out that now, developing social and economic conditions and controlling population growth have become the two major tasks facing most developing countries. Rapid population growth has brought difficulties to the development of social and economic conditions and the improvement of people's living standards in developing countries. Therefore, solving population problems requires the joint efforts of governments and people of all countries.

Ding Yuanhong hoped that the UNFPA would further expand its aid to women's development, help recipient countries establish some projects that directly benefit women, such as women's cultural education, production technology training, and enterprise management.

In addition to health and family planning, efforts should be made to help relevant countries conduct research on the aging population issue, so as to formulate specific policies and measures and effectively solve the problem.

　　我代表在联合国会议上发言
    呼吁援助发展中国家
    本报联合国６月６日电  记者刘开宸报道：中国常驻联合国副代表丁原洪大使今天呼吁联合国人口活动基金会（简称人口基金），根据世界人口形势，针对发展中国家的具体需求和优先领域，继续提供更多、更灵活的援助，为解决人口问题发挥更大的作用。
    丁原洪是在联合国开发计划署第３６届理事会会议上就有关人口基金议题发言的。他指出，现在，发展社会经济和控制人口增长已成为多数发展中国家面临的两大任务。人口的过快增长，给发展中国家发展社会经济、提高人民生活水平带来了困难。所以，解决人口问题，需要各国政府和人们的共同努力。
    丁原洪希望人口基金进一步扩大对妇女的发展援助，帮助受援国建立一些直接使妇女受益的项目，如妇女文化教育、生产技术培训和企业管理等方面。
    保健与计划生育方面外，应帮助有关各国进行人口老化问题的研究，以便制订具体政策和措施并有效地解决。
