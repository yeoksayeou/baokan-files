Mexican writer Gabriel Garcia Marquez's new work "The General in His Labyrinth" has recently topped the bestseller list in the country. Public opinion comments that "The General" is Marquez's masterpiece after "One Hundred Years of Solitude," showcasing the Nobel laureate's unceasing spirit of artistic innovation and is considered another major event in the history of Latin American literature.

In 1982, when Marquez won the Nobel Prize in Literature, the Swedish Academy praised his magnum opus "One Hundred Years of Solitude" for changing the direction of Latin American literary creation, "gathering unimaginable miracles and the purest reality of life." After "One Hundred Years of Solitude," Marquez also published works such as "The Autumn of the Patriarch," but their impact was far from that of "One Hundred Years of Solitude." Therefore, some people believed that Marquez's artistic creation had reached its peak and could no longer achieve significant breakthroughs. However, "The General" has made Mexican public opinion believe that "Marquez clearly understands how to break through himself."

This time, Marquez boldly chose Simon Bolivar as the subject of his novel. Due to Bolivar's high prestige as the liberator of Latin America, the theme itself is quite challenging. "The General" revolves around Bolivar's legendary life, narrating the various tragedies that befell this liberator during his final "delirious days," thus unveiling the "mask and myth" of this great Latin American icon. Just like the creation of "One Hundred Years of Solitude," Marquez grabs the reader's attention from the first page, arousing the reader's interest and sympathy, forcing the reader to continue reading to solve the puzzles and suspense in their mind. In "The General," Marquez dares to risk blaspheming the hero, introducing a highly revered figure to the reader in this way.

"Jose Palacios, his oldest bodyguard, saw him staring with wide-open eyes, naked in the bathtub, and thought he had drowned. Although Jose knew this was one of the ways he thought about problems, seeing his wandering, delirious state, Jose still concluded that this man no longer belonged to this world."

With a few words, Marquez sets the stage, arousing people's doubts and interest, showcasing his writing prowess. From this small scene, he uses history but is not bound by history to depict a real person, skillfully weaving the protagonist's memories into the narrative of the story, restoring Bolivar's idealized image to historical reality. Marquez, with his artistic techniques, re-creates Bolivar's glorious life: his pursuit of American freedom and unity; his courageous and unyielding struggles as a soldier, strategist, and liberator; and his failures due to betrayal, until he reveals a Bolivar who is truly human, including this person's pain, sorrow, encounters, misfortunes, and failures, until his lonely death in Santa Marta. The narrative centered around the liberator's death showcases the purest Greek tragic style.

Marquez is not a historian. He himself admits that he has "never conducted historical research," but he successfully uses historical materials for literary creation. The "General" in his pen is vivid and lifelike, not history, but shows a real historical figure: a politician, military leader, visionary, and sufferer.

It is too early to judge the achievements of "The General," but Mexican readers have already expressed their love for this book. Due to Bolivar's immense influence in Latin America, it is estimated that this book will resonate throughout Latin American countries. Mexican public opinion evaluates that "The General" showcases the author's artistic genius and dedication to artistic creation.

Now 61 years old, Marquez began his career as a journalist in 1948; in 1959, he became a correspondent for the Latin American Press in Bogota (Colombia). In the past 25 years, Marquez has been living in Mexico and Cuba. Due to his long-term engagement in journalism, people believe that one of the characteristics of his creation is the integration of news and literature, reporting and creation, creating a unique style.

### 解放者是人，不是神——马尔克斯新作《将军在迷宫里》

　　解放者是人，不是神
    ——马尔克斯新作《将军在迷宫里》
    本报记者  郭伟成
    墨西哥作家加夫列尔·加西亚·马尔克斯的新作《将军在迷宫里》最近名列该国畅销书之首。舆论评论说，《将军》是马尔克斯继《百年孤独》以后的又一部力作，显示了这位诺贝尔文学奖获得者在艺术创作上不断进取的精神并认为这是拉丁美洲文学史上的又一重大事件。
    １９８２年，马尔克斯荣获诺贝尔文学奖时，瑞典皇家学院称他的名著《百年孤独》改变了拉美文学创作的方向，“汇集了不可思议的奇迹和最纯粹的现实生活”。《百年孤独》之后，马尔克斯还发表过《家长的没落》等著作，但是影响远不如《百年孤独》，因此，曾有人认为，马尔克斯的艺术创作已经到达顶峰，不可能再有重大突破。但是，《将军》一书却使墨西哥舆论认为“马尔克斯清楚地懂得突破自我。”
    这次，马尔克斯大胆地选择了西蒙·博利瓦尔作为小说的创作对象。由于博利瓦尔作为拉丁美洲的解放者所享有的崇高声望，使得这个题材本身就具有相当的难度。《将军》一书围绕博利瓦尔的传奇生涯，叙述这位解放者在他最后那些“热昏的日子”里所发生的种种悲剧，从而揭开了这个拉美伟大偶像的“面纱与神话”。有如《百年孤独》的创作一样，马尔克斯从第一页开始就抓住读者，引起读者的兴趣与同情，迫使读者看下去，解开心头的疑问与悬念。在《将军》一书中，马尔克斯甘冒亵渎英雄之韪，这样向读者介绍一位备受尊崇的人物。
    “何塞·帕拉西奥斯，他最老的侍卫，看到他瞪着双眼，赤裸着身体浮在浴缸的水面上，以为他已经淹死了。尽管何塞知道这是他思考问题的多种方式之一，但是，瞧他那飘泊着的痴迷状态，何塞还是断定，这个人已经不属于这个世界了。”
    寥寥数语，马尔克斯布下迷阵，引起人们的疑虑和兴趣，显示了他落笔的功力。从这个小小的场景展开，运用历史又不拘泥于历史地描绘一个真正的人物，并巧妙地把主人公的回忆编织到故事的叙述中，把博利瓦尔那理想化的形象回复到历史现实中。马尔克斯以艺术的手法，再现了博利瓦尔辉煌的生平：他追求美洲自由与统一的梦想；他作为军人、战略家、解放者的英勇而不屈不挠的斗争，以及他由于背信弃义而遭到的失败，直到向人们展示出一个作为人的博利瓦尔，以及这个人的痛苦、悲伤、遭遇、不幸与失败，直到他在圣塔玛尔塔凄凉地死去。围绕解放者的死展开的叙述，显示了最纯粹的希腊式悲剧风格。
    马尔克斯不是历史学家。他本人承认自己“从未作过历史研究”，但是，他成功地运用历史材料进行了文学创作。他笔下的《将军》，人物栩栩如生，有血有肉，不是历史，却使人看到一个真实的历史人物：政治家、军事家、空想家与受难者。
    现在判断《将军》一书的成就还为时过早，但是墨西哥读者已经表示出对这本书的喜爱，由于博利瓦尔其人在拉丁美洲的巨大影响，估计这书会在拉美各国引起反响。墨西哥舆论评价说，《将军》表现出作者的艺术天才与对艺术创造的献身精神。
    今年６１岁的马尔克斯，１９４８年开始当记者；１９５９年成为古巴拉丁通讯社驻波哥大（哥伦比亚）记者。最近２５年，马尔克斯一直居住在墨西哥与古巴。由于他长期从事新闻工作，人们认为，他创作中的一个特点是把新闻与文学，报道与创作融为一体，创造了独特的风格。
