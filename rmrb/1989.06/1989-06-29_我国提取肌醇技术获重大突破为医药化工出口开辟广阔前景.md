Our country has made a major breakthrough in the application of biochemistry to extract the medicinal raw material inositol.

The Beijing Haidian Biochemical Research Center recently successfully developed a new method for extracting inositol from phytate crude products. This technology opens up broad prospects for exporting inositol products from China's medical and chemical industries to earn foreign exchange.

Inositol is a high-grade nutritional supplement and a scarce medicinal raw material. It can be used to produce drugs that promote growth, prevent fatty liver, treat hepatitis and cirrhosis, and arteriosclerosis. In addition to medical uses, inositol can be combined with other substances in industry to produce drying oils, explosives, deodorants, and more. In the past, the main raw materials for producing inositol in our country were rice bran and bran cakes. The disadvantages of these materials are that they are difficult to collect and store, and the production process is long with high investment. Extracting inositol from phytate overcomes the various weaknesses of using rice bran as a raw material and can significantly improve production efficiency.

According to Du Zhizheng, Director of the Beijing Haidian Biochemical Research Center, extracting inositol products from phytate will bring the application of China's phytate products into a new stage. Currently, this research center is establishing a national phytate development corporation and is planning to build inositol production bases in Beijing, Hunan, and Fujian.

　　我国提取肌醇技术获重大突破为医药化工出口开辟广阔前景
    新华社北京六月二十九日电  我国应用生物化学技术提取医药原料肌醇获得重大突破。
    北京海淀生物化学研究中心最近研究成功一种从植酸粗品中提炼肌醇的新方法，这项技术为我国医药和化工行业肌醇产品的出口创汇开辟了广阔的前景。
    肌醇是一种高级营养滋补料，也是一种紧缺的医药原料，用它可生产出促进生长、预防脂肪肝、治疗肝炎和肝硬化、动脉硬化等药品。除了医用外，在工业方面肌醇可与其他物质合成为干燥油、炸药、防臭剂等。我国过去生产肌醇的主要原料以米糠、糠饼为主，其缺点是原料搜集储存困难，产品提取生产周期长、投资大。而从植酸中提取肌醇，克服了用米糠做原料的种种弱点，还可以显著提高生产效益。
    据北京海淀生物化学研究中心主任杜志政介绍，从植酸中提取肌醇产品，将使我国植酸产品应用进入新阶段。目前这个研究中心正在组建全国性的植酸发展集团公司，并筹建北京、湖南、福建等肌醇生产基地。
