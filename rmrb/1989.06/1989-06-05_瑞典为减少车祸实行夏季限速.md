	Reporter Gu Yaoming reports: The Swedish Parliament recently approved a government proposal to implement summer speed limits for vehicles.

	From June 22nd to August 20th this year, the speed limit on Swedish highways will be reduced from a maximum of 110 kilometers per hour to 90 kilometers per hour.

	According to the Swedish Ministry of Transport, the rate of traffic accidents in Sweden has significantly increased this year, with many resulting in fatalities. The number of fatal road accidents in the first quarter of this year increased by 31% compared to the same period last year. Typically, the number of vehicles on the roads increases by 30% during the summer. To control the rising rate of accidents, the government has decided to implement temporary summer speed limits. In 1979, Sweden also implemented the same speed limits for summer vehicles, achieving good results.

　　瑞典为减少车祸实行夏季限速
    本报斯德哥尔摩电  记者顾耀铭报道：瑞典议会最近通过政府一项提案，实行夏季车辆限速。
    从今年６月２２日至８月２０日期间，瑞典高速公路限速将从最高时速１１０公里减为９０公里。
    据瑞典交通部介绍今年以来瑞典交通事故发生率大幅度增加，其中不少是致命事故。今年第一季度的公路死亡事故比去年同期增加了３１％。通常夏季公路车辆要增加３０％，为了控制事故发生率的提高，政府决定实行夏季车辆临时限速。１９７９年瑞典曾对夏季车辆实行同样的限速，取得了良好的效果。
