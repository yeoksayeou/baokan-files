As the 1980s drew to a close, in the dwindling list of "world's greatest" records in our country, a new feat was quietly added:

"The Great Wall Ten Thousand Li Painting." It is 633.6 meters long and 2 meters wide, composed of 660 main axes, making it the largest Chinese painting in the world today.

You cannot imagine that such a grand masterpiece could be created by a man who, even in a suit, still looks as simple and steadfast as a native of the Taihang Mountains. However, apart from this unique rock-like courage and tenacity of the mountain people, who else could have walked 7,000 li along the Great Wall in four months, and then painted continuously for 15 months, working 14 to 16 hours a day, without resting on a single holiday, and without watching a single television show or movie?

Only he could. A mid-aged Chinese Air Force painter with grand aspirations: Li Hongzhi. His name is worth remembering.

When he sits across from you, a bit awkwardly, you will immediately notice that this person is not as eloquent as some painters. Perhaps because of this, he also knows better than some what he wants to do and how to do it.

For China, or for the world, the Great Wall is no longer a barrier but has almost become a pure symbol. Just as the novel "Dream of the Red Chamber" is seen by various people as a big courtyard, a wall stretching for ten thousand li naturally will be seen by people in various ways, in various colors. Some people see these lifeless bricks and stones as the soul of the nation; others see this unparalleled wonder as the shackles of the nation; Armstrong, looking down at it from the moon, issued a sigh of wonder beyond human judgment. Li Hongzhi? He said nothing. He just wanted to sketch it, draw it, soak it, and render it on xuan paper; the most important thing is to present the "greatest in the world" in the scale of the "greatest in the world," and that's enough. The rest is left for all the black-eyed, yellow-eyed, and blue-eyed people to see, to think, and to judge.

He achieved his goal. In front of the giant painting that is one and a quarter li long, whether you stand still, move, look closely, or look from afar, you will always feel a shock of energy and a sway of momentum. Starting from the Old Dragon's Head, you pass through Shanhaiguan, Juyongguan, Badaling, Jinshanling, Jipingkou, Gubeikou, enter the Loess Plateau, cross the deserts and gobi, pass through Jiayuguan, and gaze at the Yumen Pass, all the way to the Mogao Caves in Dunhuang... Along the way, you see watchtowers standing tall, peaks towering, terraced fields layered, fields crisscrossing, wells standing, and cars and horses moving. Moreover, you experience the spring breeze and autumn rain, summer heat and winter snow, light mist and thick fog, morning dew and evening sun. In the 600-meter length, all of this is condensed into your eyes and stirs your soul. And this is just the painting. On the upper part of the painting, historical anecdotes, folk legends, border poems, and other texts written in various calligraphic styles, along with more than 150 red seals embedded in the corners of the painting, make you feel as if you are reading a thousand-year history of the Chinese nation. You cannot help but admire, appreciate, and sincerely exclaim: Amazing!

For this reason, when you walk out of the second-floor west hall of the Military Museum, you should have a discovery. This discovery is—China. Your China, our China, our China that is inseparably connected with the ten-thousand-li Great Wall. You can declare that you are no longer proud of these bricks and earth that were laid for ten thousand li, and you can even despise and scorn it, but in the end, you still have to admit that it remains an unparalleled miracle in human civilization history. We seem to have no reason to blame the incompetence and decline of our descendants on our ancestors. This way of accounting might itself be a sign of incompetence and decline. It is better not to envy (nor to enjoy) the glory of our ancestors. If possible, you should bring out the miracle belonging to your generation.

Just like Li Hongzhi.

　　属于一代人的奇迹    
    ——读李宏志《长城万里图》
    乔良　姜凡振
    ２０世纪８０年代接近尾声时，在我国所剩无多的“世界之最”的纪录簿上，又静悄悄地增加了一项新的创举：
    《长城万里图》。长６３３．６米，宽２米，由６６０个主轴组成，为当今世界最大的一件中国画。
    你无法想象这等宏幅巨制，竟会出自一位即便身着西装，依然朴实敦厚得如同太行山山民模样的人之手。不过，除了这一身山民独有的岩石般的勇毅和倔犟，你还能想象出谁会在四个月中沿万里长城徒步行进７０００多华里，接下来又一口气连续作画１５个月，每天工作１４到１６小时，其间不曾休息过一个节假日，亦不曾看过一回电视、一场电影呢？
    只有他。中国空军的一位志向宏大的中年画家：李宏志。这名字值得一记。
    他有些局促地坐到你对面时，你马上就会发现此人不及某类画家那样善于辞令。也许正因如此，他也比某些人更知道自己要干什么，同时也知道该怎么干。
    对于中国抑或对于世界，长城早已不再是一道屏障，而几乎成了一种纯粹的象征。如同一部《红楼梦》被各色人等看成了一座大杂院一样，一道长达万里的城墙，自然也会被人们看得五花八门，五光十色。一些人把这些毫无生命的砖石看作是民族的魂魄；另一些人则把这举世无双的奇迹看作是民族的枷锁；阿姆斯特朗在月球上俯看着它时，发出的却是超乎人为价值判断的惊叹。李宏志呢？他什么都没说。他只想把它在宣纸上勾出来，描出来，浸润出来，渲染出来；最重要的一点，是以“世界之最”的规模，呈现“世界之最”的雄姿，这就够了。剩下的，留给所有的黑眼珠、黄眼珠、蓝眼珠们去看，去想，去评判。
    他的目的达到了。在那长达一又四分之一华里的巨画面前，你或伫步，或移动，或近瞧，或远看，都无时无刻不感受到一种气的震动、势的摇撼。从痛饮狂潮的老龙头开始，你经山海关、居庸关，越八达岭、金山岭，过喜峰口、古北口，入黄土高原，穿大漠戈壁，出嘉峪关、眺玉门关，直抵敦煌莫高窟……一路来墩台翘矗、峰峦雄浑、梯田层叠、阡陌纵横、井架林立、车水马龙，更兼数度春风秋雨、夏日冬雪、淡霭浓雾、晨露夕照，在６００余米的长度内，一一浓缩进你的眼底，也摄动起你的心魄。而这还仅仅是画面。在画的上端，用真草隶篆多种字体书写的历史典故、民间传说、边塞诗词等等，再加上嵌于画边画角的一百五十余方朱红印章，更能令你如展读华夏民族的一部千年长史，由不得你不感佩，不赞赏，不源自肺腑地发出一声慨叹：了不起！
    为此，当你走出军事博物馆二楼西厅时，你该有一次发现。这发现就是——中国。你的中国，我们的中国，我们的与万里长城切不开也割不断地维系在一起的中国。你尽可以宣布自己不再为这铺筑万里的砖块土方自豪，你甚至还可以蔑视它、鄙弃它，但到头来你还得承认，它仍然是人类文明史上无可匹敌的奇迹。我们似乎没有什么理由可以把子孙的无能和衰败算在先人们的账上。这种算法恐怕本身就是一种无能和衰败。还是不要妒嫉（当然也不要坐享）我们祖先的光荣为好，如果可能，你就该拿出属于你这一代人的奇迹来。
    就像李宏志这样。
