Comrade Deng Xiaoping’s important speech during his reception of senior military officers from the capital’s martial law troops has been disseminated to all party, government, and military departments and organizations nationwide. At this time when the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing has achieved a major victory, Comrade Xiaoping’s speech has greatly inspired all the soldiers and officers of the People’s Liberation Army, the People’s Armed Police, and the public security personnel who participated in this struggle, as well as the entire Party, the entire military, and the people of the entire nation. People are delighted to see that the situation is now under control, and China’s revolution and construction will continue to advance along the line, principles, and policies formulated by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and along the “one central task, two basic points” summarized by the Thirteenth Party Congress.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping’s speech is far-sighted and profound in its analysis of the causes and nature of this counter-revolutionary riot, affirming the correctness of the measures we have taken, highly praising the soldierly spirit and the role of the iron wall of the People’s Liberation Army, and proposing the major historical question of “calmly considering the past and also considering the future.” He also provides clear answers to some of the most important issues. Comrade Xiaoping’s speech is a programmatic document to unify the thoughts of the entire Party and the people of the entire nation.

Over the past two months, the situation in Beijing has developed from a student movement to turmoil, and finally to a counter-revolutionary riot. Some cities have also experienced varying degrees of unrest. How did all this happen? People’s understanding is far from consistent. Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out in his speech: This turmoil was bound to come. It was determined by both the international climate and China’s own climate, and it was inevitable, regardless of people’s will. The only question was when and how big it would be. He also pointed out: Once the situation erupted, it became clear. Their fundamental slogans were mainly two: one is to overthrow the Communist Party, and the other is to overthrow the socialist system. Their goal is to establish a completely Westernized bourgeois republic. This provides the most powerful ideological weapon for us to analyze this turmoil and riot and to untangle various ideological knots.

History will prove that this keen insight and scientific judgment will play an important role not only for China’s socialist cause but also for the smooth development of the international communist movement. In recent years, due to the influence of the international climate, bourgeois liberalization has been rampant. If we show weakness and retreat in the face of the bourgeoisie’s attack, the People’s Republic of China, which we have paid for with the sacrifice of tens of millions of people, will be destroyed, the achievements of 40 years of socialist construction and 10 years of reform will be destroyed, and China will once again become a vassal of imperialism. In this sense, the Chinese Communist Party, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping as its representative, has steadied the ship in the face of a storm, and is indeed the backbone of the great cause of socialism-communism.

After suppressing this counter-revolutionary riot, where will China go? Comrade Xiaoping clearly pointed out that the line, principles, and policies formulated since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee are correct, and the “one central task, two basic points” are correct. The two basic points, namely the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up, are the foundation of our state and the path to our strength. If there were any mistakes in the past, it was that we did not consistently uphold the Four Cardinal Principles, and did not educate the people, students, all cadres, and Party members with them as the fundamental ideology. We must learn from this lesson, and in the future, no matter how complex the situation, we must always remember Comrade Deng Xiaoping’s consistent advocacy: we must grasp both aspects, and we must adhere to the two-point theory. Will China retreat to a policy of closure? Comrade Xiaoping clearly pointed out: Our basic propositions, from the development strategy to the principles and policies, including reform and opening up, are all correct. If there is anything lacking, it is that reform and opening up have not gone far enough. We must seriously understand Comrade Xiaoping’s speech. At present, we must seriously summarize our experience, continue to adhere to what is correct, correct what is wrong, and strengthen what is lacking. By doing so, this bad incident of the counter-revolutionary riot may make our steps forward more stable, better, and even faster.

The counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing has been initially suppressed, and the traffic order, social order, and life order in the capital have begun to recover, and production is gradually resuming. Nationwide, the situation is gradually stabilizing. But some comrades still have some “buttons” unbuttoned in their minds, and their understanding of certain issues is still confused. Internationally, there is anti-China and anti-communist propaganda, and various rumors still have a market domestically. At present, there are many tasks at hand, both domestically and diplomatically, we face some new problems, the order in various aspects still needs to be further restored, and various tasks need to be done better than before. What do we rely on to unify our thoughts? What do we rely on to stabilize people’s minds? What do we rely on to unite our strength? At present, the most important thing is to seriously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping’s important speech. With this speech as a powerful ideological weapon, we can overcome all interference, conquer all difficulties, unite all forces that can be united, and continue to advance bravely to build our country into a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modernized nation!

### 统一全党思想的纲领性文件——认真学习邓小平同志重要讲话

　　统一全党思想的纲领性文件
    ——认真学习邓小平同志重要讲话
    邓小平同志接见首都戒严部队军以上干部时发表的重要讲话，已经传达到全国党、政、军各部门、各机关。在平息北京反革命暴乱取得重大胜利的时候，小平同志的这一讲话极大地鼓舞了所有参加这场斗争的解放军指战员、武警指战员和公安干警同志们，鼓舞了全党、全军和全国人民。人们高兴地看到：大局已定，中国革命和建设的航船将继续沿着党的十一届三中全会制定的路线、方针、政策，沿着党的十三大概括的“一个中心、两个基本点”胜利前进。
    邓小平同志的讲话，高瞻远瞩，深刻精辟地分析了这场反革命暴乱发生的原因和实质，指明了我们采取的措施的正确性，高度评价了解放军的人民子弟兵本色和钢铁长城的作用，提出了“冷静地考虑一下过去，也考虑一下未来”的重大历史课题，并对其中一些最重要的问题作出了明确的回答。小平同志的这一讲话，是统一全党和全国人民思想的纲领性文件。
    近两个月里，北京城里的事态不断发展，由学潮发展到动乱，最后发展到反革命暴乱。有些城市也出现了程度不同的骚乱。这一切究竟是怎么发生的？人们的认识是很不一致的。邓小平同志在讲话中指出：这场风波迟早要来。这是国际的大气候和中国自己的小气候所决定了的，是一定要来的，是不以人们的意志为转移的，只不过是迟早的问题，大小的问题。他还指出：事情一爆发出来，就很明确。他们的根本口号主要是两个，一是要打倒共产党，一是要推翻社会主义制度。他们的目的是要建立一个完全西方化的资产阶级共和国。这就给了我们分析这场动乱和暴乱，解开各种思想疙瘩的最有力的思想武器。
    历史将证明，这个敏锐的洞察和科学的判断，不但对中国的社会主义事业而且对国际共产主义运动的顺利发展，都将起到重要的作用。这些年，由于国际大气候的影响，资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥。在资产阶级的进攻面前，如果示弱、退让，我们牺牲了几千万人换来的中华人民共和国将毁于一旦，４０年社会主义建设的成果和十年改革的成果将毁于一旦，中国将重新沦为帝国主义的附庸。从这个意义上说，以邓小平同志为代表的中国共产党人挽狂澜于即倒，不愧为社会主义—共产主义伟大事业的中流砥柱。
    平息了这场反革命暴乱以后，中国将向何处去？小平同志明确指出，党的十一届三中全会以来制订的路线方针政策是正确的，“一个中心、两个基本点”是正确的。两个基本点，即四个坚持和改革开放，是我们的立国之本，是我们的强国之路。如果说过去有错误的话，就是坚持四项基本原则还不够一贯，没有把它作为基本思想来教育人民，教育学生，教育全体干部和共产党员。我们要汲取这个教训，今后无论遇到怎样复杂的情势，我们都必须牢记邓小平同志一贯主张，要两手抓，要两点论。中国会不会退回去搞关闭政策？小平同志明确指出：我们的一些基本提法，从发展战略到方针政策，包括改革开放，都是对的。要说不够，就是改革开放得还不够。我们要认真领会小平同志这些讲话。当前要认真总结经验，对的要继续坚持，失误的要纠正，不足的要加点劲。这样做了，发生反革命暴乱这件坏事可能会使我们前进的步子迈得更稳、更好，甚至于更快。
    北京的反革命暴乱初步平息了，首都的交通秩序、社会秩序和生活秩序已经开始恢复，生产也逐步在全面恢复。就全国来说，局势正在逐步地稳定。但一些同志思想上还有些“扣子”没解开，对某些问题的认识还有混乱，国际上有反华反共鼓噪，各种谣言在国内还有市场。当前，各项工作头绪纷繁，内政外交都遇到一些新的问题，各方面的秩序还有待于进一步恢复，各项工作要做得比过去更好。我们靠什么统一思想？靠什么稳定人心？靠什么凝聚力量？当前，最重要的就是要认真学好邓小平同志的重要讲话。以这个讲话为强大思想武器，就能排除一切干扰，战胜一切困难，团结一切可以团结的力量，为把我国建设成为富强、民主、文明的社会主义现代化国家继续奋勇前进！
