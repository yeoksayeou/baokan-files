The U.S. has designated Japan, Brazil, and India as nations engaging in unfair trade practices, sparking discontent among Western allies over U.S. trade policies.

	PARIS, May 31 (Xinhua) — At the annual meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) held in Paris on May 31, representatives from several major Western countries expressed strong dissatisfaction with U.S. trade policies.

	Last week, U.S. President George H.W. Bush announced that the U.S. government had decided to designate Japan, Brazil, and India as countries engaging in "unfair trade" practices against the United States. He threatened to use trade sanctions to force these countries to remove trade barriers against U.S. goods.

	Japanese Foreign Minister Shintaro Abe was the first to criticize the U.S. He stated, "Trade protectionist measures, especially unilateral actions, could undermine confidence in the world economy." He reiterated that Japan is prepared to negotiate with the U.S. on trade issues, "but not under the threat of unilateral sanctions."

	British Foreign Secretary Geoffrey Howe supported Japan's stance. He said that unilateral restrictions on trade cannot cure the U.S. trade deficit and that even threatening to use such measures could endanger the multilateral trading system. He emphasized that it is crucial for the U.S. to respect the principles of the multilateral trading system.

	Franz Andreas, the Vice-President of the European Commission responsible for external relations, stated that U.S. laws are inconsistent with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). He said, "No country has the right to interpret world trade rules according to its own views."

	Representatives from West Germany and Canada also expressed concerns about U.S. trade policies at the meeting.

　　美把日巴印视为不公平贸易国
    西方盟国对美贸易政策不满
    新华社北京６月１日电  巴黎消息：在５月３１日于巴黎开幕的经济合作与发展组织年会上，几个西方主要国家的代表在发言中对美国的贸易政策表示了强烈不满。
    上周，美国总统布什宣布，美国政府已决定把日本、巴西、印度３国视为对美国实行“不公平贸易”的国家，威胁要用贸易制裁的办法来迫使他们取消对美国的贸易壁垒。
    日本外相宇野首先对美国进行了指责。他在发言中说，“贸易保护主义措施，特别是寻求某些单方面的行动可能破坏对世界经济的信心。”他重申，日本准备与美国进行贸易谈判，“但不是在单方面制裁的威胁之下”进行谈判。
    英国外交大臣杰弗里·豪支持日本的立场。他说，单方面限制贸易的措施不能医治美国的外贸赤字，“甚至威胁要使用这种办法也会危及到多边贸易体系”。他说，美国尊重多边贸易体系的原则是至关重要的。
    共同体委员会负责对外关系的副主席弗朗斯·安德里森说，美国的法律与关税及贸易总协定的规定是不一致的。他说，“没有一个国家能有权力按他自己的看法来解释世界贸易规则”。
    西德和加拿大的代表在会上对美国的贸易政策也表示忧虑。
