Title: After Returning to the City

	After the spring snow melted, carrying with it the dust of the countryside, I returned to Beijing.
	Upon entering the city, I saw towering buildings and cars weaving through the streets. Along the sidewalks and alleyways, colorful stalls and shops sprouted like mushrooms. The salesgirls with blue-framed glasses and red lips were like sparkling musical notes, dancing on the sheet music of the crowd, emitting tinkling sounds.
	But I prefer the markets in the countryside. There, haggling over fresh vegetables and fruits picked early in the morning with an old man squatting on the ground is a kind of artistic enjoyment. In the market, buyers and sellers usually know each other, inside and outside the counter is one world. Each transaction is a story, a rural poem.
	As for walking, the country roads are simple, either fast or slow, either stopping or standing, with no particular rules! Here, it's different. Going out to the street is like going to war; you must keep your eyes and ears open. If you are even a little slow, you will surely be called out by the police or scolded by the driver. At noon, the streets are not where you walk yourself; you are carried forward by the crowd—just as you fear stepping on the high heels in front of you, your own shoes have already been stepped on by those behind you.
	After being away from the city for more than twenty years, I have returned, and even walking has to be learned anew.
	Going out is difficult, but staying at home is also hard to find peace. "Knock, knock, knock," someone is knocking at the door. Opening it, I see a stranger, a sister-in-law. She speaks with an accent from another place, smiling awkwardly, "Hehe, master, do you have any extra grain tickets?"
	This city is like a flywheel, relentlessly rushing forward, leaving behind the blue sky, the flock of pigeons, and the melody of the alley that I remember. The streets, houses, and fields here once flowed with my youthful blood, sweat, and tears, and now they seem so unfamiliar.
	Perhaps it is to find something that has passed, I often wander in the gullies behind the courtyard. One day, in a secluded place at the foot of the mountain, I saw overgrown weeds and chirping wild birds. I kicked the ground with my foot, revealing a layer of black, shiny soil, and sighed, "Good soil, good soil!" I thought, why not use the skills I learned in the countryside to start a vegetable plot and become the king of this land!
	Once the plan was made, I started working on it. My wife also helped with the rammer. In a few days, a small green kingdom appeared in this place surrounded by three green mountains and one willow tree in the suburbs of Beijing.
	From then on, cucumbers, zucchini, spinach, amaranth, and even snow peas, all the heart's delights, changed with the seasons, coming one after another. Although it was just a small patch, it still made the neighbor's grandma envious. If there were guests, I could boast, "Please, please, it's homegrown."
	At this time, I proudly thought, this kind of suburban leisure, in Beijing, is not something everyone can have!
	But it was still a dream.
	Soon, my wife, unwilling to retire and be idle, found a job outside. Every evening, naturally, the old man would serve the dishes and sit by the side, watching her eat and listening to her "news from the bowl's edge." She didn't ask about the garden work.
	The son then quit his job. He counted on his fingers and clicked his tongue, complaining, "Your few rows of vegetables aren't worth the tip I earn from one trip!"
	The ruler of the green kingdom became a true loner. After taking on the role of the family's main man, the work in the house and garden gradually became busy, then tiring, then boring. In the garden, I could no longer muster the spirit to watch the setting sun and the birds returning to their nests, or to recite, "The setting sun and the returning pigeons fly together, the green vegetables and the radishes are of one color." I gradually felt that this pursuit of leisure might be the real reason for my restlessness after returning to the city.
	I finally picked up my old briefcase and went out to do odd jobs.
	It seems that my pastoral poetry cannot be realized. I have to say goodbye to leisure, to tranquility, and to the dream that is fading away. I have to join the city's crowd, to compete, to struggle, to give, and to create, even if my hands and feet are slow and I am still out of breath...

　　回城以后
    姚北雁
    春雪消融时，带着田野的尘土，我回到了北京。
    进了城，但见高楼林立，汽车穿行。街路边，胡同口，蘑菇般钻出来一簇簇五颜六色的棚铺摊店。蓝眼框红嘴唇的售货小姐们，像是一颗颗晶莹的音符，在人流汇成的曲谱上跳动，发出银铃般的声音。
    但我更喜欢村镇的集市。那里，对着水灵灵的鲜菜和清早摘下的瓜果，跟蹲在泥地上的老汉讨价还价，简直是一种艺术享受。市场里的买卖双方多半认识，柜里柜外是一个世界。每次交易，都是一篇故事，一首乡土诗。
    再说走路。乡间土路，或快或慢，或停或站，哪有多少讲究！这里可不。上街好比上战场，必须眼观四面耳听八方。稍一迟慢，定遭警察点名或司机训斥。正午时分的大街，那哪是自己走，简直是被人流裹着向前淌——正怕踩着前头的高跟，自己的鞋已被后头的踏上了。
    离城二十多年，如今回来了，连走路也得从头学起。
    出门不易，呆在家里也难得安宁。“笃、笃、笃”，有人敲门。开门一看，却是位陌生的大嫂。她操着外地口音，讪笑着，“嘻嘻，老师傅，有多余的粮票么？”
    这城市像是装上了飞轮，一股劲地朝前奔，把我记忆中的蓝天鸽群和小巷琴声，全都抛在身后。这里的街路、小屋、山野，曾流过我青春的血、汗和泪水，梦魂萦绕过的如今却显得如此陌生。
    大概是寻找什么逝去的东西吧，我常在院后沟壑间闲走。一天，在山脚僻静处，见杂草丛生，野雀聒噪。走过去以脚蹭地，竟露出了乌黑油亮的一层，不禁叹道，“好土好土！”心想，何不拿出在乡下学来的本事，开块菜地成一统，在此占地为王呢！
    主意既定动手就干，老妻夯子也来助力。不几天，一小块绿色王国就出现在这三面青山一面柳的京郊宝地。
    从此，丝瓜黄瓜、菠菜苋菜、以至雪里蕻，心里美之辈，随季节而更易，纷纭自来。虽仅一撮，却也引得邻家太婆称羡。倘有客来，更可夸耀：“请，请，自家种的。”
    此时我得意地想，这般郊居野趣，在京城，不是人人得而有之的！
    但依然是一场梦。
    不久，老妻不甘退休寂寞，在外头找到事做。每天傍晚，自然是老头端上饭菜，坐在一旁看她大嚼，听她的“碗边新闻”。菜地的活，她问也不问。
    儿子接着辞职。他扳着指头咂着嘴，数落着：“你那几行菜不顶我跑一趟车的零头！”
    绿色王国的统治者成了真正的孤家寡人。担任家庭主男的差使之后，这家里地里的活，逐渐由忙而累，由累而乏，由乏而厌。在菜地，再也提不起精神看红日西下鸟投林，低吟“落霞与归鹊齐飞、青菜共萝卜一色”了。我渐感到这种情趣的追求或许正是我回城后不得安宁的真正原因。
    我终于提起旧皮包，也跑出去打零工去了。
    看来，我的田园诗做不得了。我得跟休闲告别、跟宁静告别，跟正在逝去的梦告别。我得投入这城市的人流，去争、去挤、去给予、去创造，尽管手脚迟慢，还喘着气……
