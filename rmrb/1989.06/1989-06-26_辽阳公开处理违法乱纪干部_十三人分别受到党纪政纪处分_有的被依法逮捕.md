Liao Yang Publicly Punishes Law-Breaking and Disciplinary Party Cadres

Thirteen individuals received party and administrative disciplinary actions; some were arrested by law.

Liao Yang City, Liaoning Province, recently held a meeting to announce disciplinary actions against 13 party members and cadres who violated laws and regulations. Some were subsequently arrested by law enforcement.

The vice-chairman of the People's Congress Standing Committee of Tai Zi River District, Guo Qi Ming, and the deputy procurator of the district procuratorate, Min Zhen Ke, in March 1987, took 100,000 yuan in bank drafts to Guangzhou to purchase a used Toyota van for the district People's Congress Standing Committee. The agreed price was 78,000 yuan, but they requested the seller to issue an invoice for 85,000 yuan, using the extra money to each buy a color television. Additionally, Guo Qi Ming misappropriated 1,000 yuan of public funds for over a year. Min Zhen Ke, in October 1986, used his position to transfer 2,500 yuan from fines and confiscated funds returned by the municipal procuratorate to the district procuratorate, to purchase a VCR from the municipal department store. With the approval of the municipal committee, Guo Qi Ming was expelled from the party, and the municipal committee recommended that the district People's Congress remove him from his position as vice-chairman of the Standing Committee. Min Zhen Ke was expelled from the party and his public position, and has been arrested by the public security authorities.

The deputy director of the Economic Commission of Bai Ta District, Lian Jing Wei, and the deputy manager of Liao Yang Tong Da Trade Company, Pu Dian Kai, last July took 450,000 yuan in bank drafts to Zhu Hai to pay a deposit for the purchase of 500 Japanese-made fax machines. In Zhu Hai, at Pu Dian Kai's request, Lian Jing Wei handed over the bank drafts to Pu, who deposited them into his own account at the trade department he managed in Zhu Hai. As a token of gratitude, Pu Dian Kai gave Lian Jing Wei a 47-inch color television, a VCR, and over 800 yuan in cash. Lian Jing Wei was expelled from the party and has been arrested by law.

　　辽阳公开处理违法乱纪干部    
    十三人分别受到党纪政纪处分　有的被依法逮捕
    新华社沈阳６月２６日电（通讯员陈殿升）辽宁省辽阳市最近召开大会，宣布对１３名违法乱纪的党员干部给予党纪政纪处分，会后有的被依法逮捕。
    太子河区人大常委会副主任郭启明和区检察院副检察长闵振科，１９８７年３月携带１０万元汇票去广州为区人大常委会购买一台旧的丰田牌面包车。买卖双方议定的价格为７．８万元，但他们要求卖方按８．５万元开发票，两人用多出的钱各买了一台彩色电视机。另外，郭启明还占用公款１千元达１年多之久。闵振科还在１９８６年１０月利用职务之便，从市检察院退给区检察院的罚款、没收款中，转了２５００元到市百货批发站，为自己买了１台录像机。经市委批准，郭启明被开除党籍，市委还建议太子河区人代会撤销其区人大常委会副主任职务。闵振科被开除党籍、公职，已由公安机关依法逮捕。
    白塔区计经委副主任廉景威和辽阳通达贸易公司副经理朴殿凯，去年７月带了４５万元汇票去珠海送购买５００台日本进口传真机的定金。到珠海后，应朴殿凯的请求，廉景威把汇票交给了朴，由朴划入自己在珠海承包的工贸部。为了答谢廉景威，朴殿凯送给他１台４７厘米的彩色电视机、１台录像单放机，还送给他８００多元人民币。廉景威被开除党籍，并被依法逮捕。
