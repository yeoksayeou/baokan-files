    History Written in Stone
    Whether it is the Great Pyramids of Egypt among the world's seven wonders, or the Great Wall of China and the Summer Palace, these magnificent relics all powerfully attest to the words of the British historian Arnold Toynbee: "Hard stone preserves and tells us about the civilization of our ancestors."

    Because of the enduring nature of stone, scientists are able to assert that the earliest stage of human history was the Stone Age, where stone tools were the primary means of labor.

    With the advent of the Bronze Age, humans began to revere stone. Ancient Egyptian scriptures coexisted with stone for 7,000 years. The Chinese, as early as before the Common Era, inscribed historical records on metal and stone. In mythology, Nuwa mended the heavens with stones, and Sun Wukong emerged from a stone.

    In the realm of art, without stone carvings and sculptures, the history of world art would be incomplete. Archaeological discoveries show that as early as 5,000 to 6,000 years ago, the Chinese knew how to carve jade and other stones into exquisite works of art. From the 4th to the 7th century AD, China completed ten major cave art sites: the Mogao Caves, the Yungang Caves, the Longmen Grottoes, the Kongxian Caves, the Maiji Caves, the Bingling Temple, the Xiangtangshan Caves, the Tianlongshan Caves, the Shizhongshan Caves, and the Dazu Rock Carvings. In foreign countries, from ancient Egypt to modern-day Paris, sculpture has always been considered the soul of art. In the Louvre Museum's collection of over 400,000 items, sculptures make up the majority.

    Stone sometimes also becomes a symbol of political power. It is said that in ancient times, the ancestor of the Jewish people, Jacob, used a stone as a pillow during his trials. This stone, after many vicissitudes, was brought to Ireland by a Greek prince and later taken to London by the British monarch Edward I, where it was placed under the throne in Westminster Abbey for the coronation of successive English kings. This stone has been preserved to this day and is known as the "Stone of Destiny" or the "Coronation Stone."

    石写的历史
    不管是埃及的金字塔等世界七大奇观，还是我国的万里长城和圆明园等宏伟遗迹，都有力印证了英国历史学家托因比的这句名言：“坚硬的石头保留并向我们转述了祖先的文明。”
    由于石头的不朽，科学家们才敢断言，人类历史的最初阶段是以石器为主要劳动工具的石器时代。
    青铜时代开始后，人类迷信石头。埃及古文同石头共存7000年。中国人早在纪元前就将史料铭于金石。在神话传说中，女娲补天用的是石头，孙大圣是从石头里蹦出来的。
    在艺术领域，假如没有石刻石雕，世界美术史将残缺不全。考古发掘表明，早在5000—6000年前，中国人就懂得把玉石雕刻成精美的艺术品。公元4世纪至7世纪，我国相继完成了十大石窟艺术：敦煌石窟、云岗石窟、龙门石窟、巩县石窟、麦积山石窟、炳灵寺石窟、响堂山石窟、天龙山石窟、石钟山石窟和大足石窟。在外国，从古埃及到现代巴黎，雕塑一向被视为艺术之魂。在卢浮宫的40多万件展品中，雕塑品占了绝大部分。
    石头有时候又成为政治权力的象征。相传远古时期，犹太人的祖先雅各在历经劫难时，曾将一块石头当作枕头。这块石头几经沧桑，被一位希腊王子带到爱尔兰，后又由英国君主爱德华一世携往伦敦，置于历代英王加冕的威斯敏斯特大教堂的宝座之下。这块石头存留至今，人称“天命石”或“加冕石”。
