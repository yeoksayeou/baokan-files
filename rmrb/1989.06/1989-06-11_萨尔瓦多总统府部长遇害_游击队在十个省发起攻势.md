	The main strategist of the new government of El Salvador, Presidential Advisor José Antonio Rodríguez, was assassinated this morning.

	According to reports from various news media in Mexico City, Rodríguez was killed this morning in front of his private residence in the western part of San Salvador. Two of his bodyguards were also killed. Witnesses said that at the time, Rodríguez was about to get into his car when two strangers suddenly emerged from across the street. One of them sprayed the area with a machine gun, killing the driver and the bodyguards. The other person shot Rodríguez. By this time, Rodríguez had already gotten into the car and was lying in a pool of blood. After the assailants fled, Rodríguez's wife drove him to the hospital, but he died despite efforts to save him.

	Meanwhile, it is reported that the Salvadoran guerrillas launched a full-scale attack on the far-right government of the Nationalist Republican Alliance in 10 out of 14 provinces across the country starting at midnight on the 7th. By the 8th, they had killed 156 people and severely damaged 5 helicopters. At the same time, various political parties and social organizations in El Salvador have also expressed their dissatisfaction with the new government, demanding improvements in the economic conditions of workers and respect for human rights.
