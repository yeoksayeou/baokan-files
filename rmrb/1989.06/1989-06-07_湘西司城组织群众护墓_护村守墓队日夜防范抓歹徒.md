Xiangxi Sichen Organizes Villagers to Protect Tombs
Village Protection Squads Guard Tombs Day and Night to Prevent and Catch Criminals

	Reported by People's Daily: In Yongshun County, Xiangxi, the newly appointed cultural relics management officer, Xiang Yongming, faced with the rampant activities of tomb raiders, organized all the young people in the village to form a village protection squad. They guard the tombs day and night, successfully catching six tomb raiders. Sichen, historically known as the "giant town of the Five Streams and the border city of a hundred miles," is the political, economic, and cultural center of the Tujia people in Xiangxi, with a history of over 800 years. Many national cultural relics and ancient sites have been preserved to this day. Recently, due to some rumors circulating among the local people, they have been stealing tombs in groups of three or five. This protection squad has twice chased away tomb raiders at night in the Zijin Mountain tomb area. Not long ago, strange lights appeared again in the Zijin Mountain tomb area, attracting the attention of Xiang Yongming. He carefully inspected the area and found several people covered in yellow mud squatting in the bushes eating baked rice cakes, which was highly suspicious. Therefore, he organized the village protection squad members to capture these criminals.

　　湘西司城组织群众护墓
    护村守墓队日夜防范抓歹徒
    本报讯  湘西永顺县司城村新上任的文物管理员向永明同志面对着盗墓分子的猖獗活动，他把全村的青年组织起来，成立了护村守墓队，日夜进行防范，一举抓获６名盗墓分子。司城在历史上被称为“五溪之巨镇，百里之边城”，是湘西土家族政治、经济、文化的中心，具有８００多年的历史，许多民族文物古迹遗留至今。最近一个时期，由于当地群众听信一些谣传，便三五成群结伙盗墓。这个护墓队曾两次深夜在紫金山墓地打跑了盗墓分子。不久前，紫金山墓地又出现了奇怪的火光，引起了向永明同志的注意。他仔细查看，发现几个满身沾着黄泥的人正蹲在草丛中烧粑粑吃，十分可疑。于是，他组织护村守墓队员，将这伙歹徒抓获。
