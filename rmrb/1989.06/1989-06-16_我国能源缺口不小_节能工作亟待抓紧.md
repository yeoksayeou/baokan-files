Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 16th.

China's energy gap is substantial, and energy conservation efforts need to be intensified urgently. A relevant official from the State Planning Commission recently disclosed that this year, the nation faces a significant energy supply shortfall, with enormous losses and waste, and considerable potential for energy conservation. He urged energy-consuming units, especially factories and enterprises, to prioritize energy conservation to boost production and enhance efficiency, and to actively promote the establishment of energy-efficient factories, industries, and cities.

The official revealed that in 1989, the energy supply gap is approximately 3,000 million tons of standard coal. Specifically, there is a shortage of 70 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity, 5 million tons of oil, and 3,000 million tons of coal. The supply of coal, electricity, and oil is extremely tight. Experts predict that during the Eighth Five-Year Plan period, the energy gap will be around 200 million tons of standard coal, and by the end of the century, the gap will increase to 3-4 billion tons of standard coal. On the other hand, energy waste is still a serious issue. For every billion dollars of GDP, China consumes three to four times more energy than some developed countries and twice as much as India. Within the same industry in China, the energy consumption of leading and lagging enterprises varies significantly. For example, the comprehensive energy consumption per ton of steel ranges from a minimum of 1.17 tons of standard coal to a maximum of 2.28 tons, a difference of 95%; the comprehensive energy consumption per ton of small-scale chemical fertilizer ranges from a minimum of 1,000 million kilocalories to a maximum of 1,800 million kilocalories, a difference of 80%; the coal consumption per ton of cement clinker ranges from a minimum of 107 kilograms of standard coal to a maximum of 215 kilograms, a difference of 100%; the standard coal consumption per kilowatt-hour of electricity ranges from a minimum of 302 grams to a maximum of 1,000 grams, a difference of 2.3 times; the electricity consumption per unit weight of flat glass ranges from a minimum of 2.9 kilowatt-hours to a maximum of 28.8 kilowatt-hours, a difference of nearly 9 times.

The official emphasized that all regions and departments must further strengthen energy conservation efforts. While promoting social energy conservation education, enhancing macro-control, appropriately increasing investment to advance energy-saving technologies, and establishing energy conservation organizations to strengthen leadership, it is also necessary to actively research and formulate a series of urgently needed energy conservation regulations, gradually bringing energy conservation work into the legal framework to achieve greater energy conservation results.

　　我国能源缺口不小
    节能工作亟待抓紧
    本报讯  记者鲁牧报道：国家计委有关负责人日前透露，今年全国能源供应缺口不小，而损失浪费惊人，节能潜力很大。他呼吁用能单位特别是厂矿企业，要以节约求增产，以节能求效益，大力开展建立节能工厂、节能行业、节能城市活动。
    据这位负责人介绍，１９８９年能源缺口约为３０００多万吨标准煤。其中，缺电７００亿度，缺油５００万吨，缺煤３０００万吨。煤、电、油供应十分紧张。专家预测，“八五”计划期间能源缺口约为２亿吨标准煤，本世纪末能源缺口将增大到３至４亿吨标准煤。另一方面，能源的损失浪费现象还很严重。全国每亿美元国民生产总值所耗能源总量，比一些经济发达国家高出三、四倍，比发展中国家印度也高一倍。在国内同行业，先进与后进企业的能耗指标相差很大，如：每吨钢的综合能耗，最低１．１７吨标准煤，最高则达２．２８吨，高出９５％；每吨小化肥的综合能耗，最低１０００万千卡，最高达１８００万千卡，高出８０％；每吨水泥熟料的煤耗，最低１０７公斤标准煤，最高则达２１５公斤，高出１倍；每发１度电所耗的标准煤，最低３０２克，最高为１０００克，高出２．３倍；每重量箱平板玻璃的电耗，最低２．９度，最高２８．８度，高出近９倍。
    这位负责同志强调，各地区、部门要进一步抓好节能工作。在开展社会节能宣传教育，加强宏观调控，适当增加投入以推进节能技术进步，健全节能组织以加强领导的同时，积极研究制订一批急需的节能法规，将节能工作逐步纳入法制轨道，以取得更大的节能实效。
