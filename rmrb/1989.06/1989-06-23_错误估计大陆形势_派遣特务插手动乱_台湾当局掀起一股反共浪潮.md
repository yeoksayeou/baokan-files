In the process of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, the Taiwanese authorities misjudged the situation, believing that the opportunity they had waited for 40 years to "anti-communist and recover the mainland" had arrived. They stirred up an anti-communist wave both inside and outside the island. The Kuomintang Central Committee issued a statement inciting mainland compatriots to "force the CCP to abandon the four cardinal principles and further overthrow the CCP," and at the same time announced that they would raise $100 million to "support the mainland's democratic movement" to promote the realization of the "democratic movement" goals.

The mouthpiece of the Taiwanese authorities, the "Central Daily News" and other newspapers, during this period, published numerous so-called "mainland news" with lies covering the pages; the official "China Broadcasting Company" of the Kuomintang increased four shortwave frequencies to broadcast to the mainland 24 hours a day; the three television stations in Taiwan also extended the news broadcast time. The rumor mongers in Taiwan not only compiled the rumors of "Voice of America" and Hong Kong newspapers, but also added many of their own fabrications. For example, on June 5, the "Central Daily News" and other Taiwanese newspapers respectively used headlines such as "Blood is flowing, flesh is flying, ten thousand martyrs at Tiananmen," "Beijing's bloody wind and rain, casualties exceed 20,000," and "Tiananmen Square is a river of blood" to fabricate sensational rumors. Some reports even said that on Tiananmen Square, "when the tanks ran over the tents, some students were still in their dreams," forgetting that there could still be people in "dream" on Tiananmen Square at that time.

According to reports in Taiwanese newspapers, during the turmoil in Beijing, the Kuomintang authorities held several Central Standing Committee meetings and high-level meetings to study anti-communist strategies. Especially after the counter-revolutionary riot was suppressed, the Taiwanese authorities publicly stated that "recovering the mainland is imminent," and encouraged mainland compatriots to "bravely rise up to resist the communist regime and politically attack to destroy the CCP." At the same time, the Taiwanese authorities planned a series of anti-communist activities, such as inviting some anti-communist academic groups on the island to hold a "symposium on caring for the mainland students' democratic movement," establishing a "publicity research and design group" to strengthen the anti-communist propaganda of the Taiwanese media, and the "Chinese Youth Anti-Communist Salvation Corps" organized a demonstration with 10 million participants called "hand in hand, heart to heart" anti-communist demonstration. At the beginning of June, at the Kuomintang's 13th Central Committee's Second Plenary Session, someone initiated the establishment of a "$100 million fund to support the mainland's democratic and free movement," and set up a special account in the name of the Kuomintang Central Committee. Overseas, the Taiwanese authorities incited some overseas Chinese associations through their overseas agencies to frequently organize anti-communist parades and instigated and funded various anti-communist elements to return to the mainland to engage in illegal activities.

It is particularly worth noting that during this period, the Taiwanese intelligence agencies instructed their spy agents infiltrated in the mainland and temporarily dispatched spies to the mainland to intensify activities and interfere with the turmoil. On June 11, the director of the Kuomintang Central Committee's Mainland Work Committee, Xiao Changle, bluntly said, "The mainland's democratic movement is the best proof of our work on the mainland," so the CCP "points the arrow at Taiwan, and we have no need to deny it."

　　错误估计大陆形势　派遣特务插手动乱    
    台湾当局掀起一股反共浪潮
    新华社北京６月２３日电  本社记者综述：在北京发生动乱和反革命暴乱过程中，台湾当局错误估计形势，认为他们等待４０年之久的“反共复国”时机已到，在岛内外掀起了一股反共浪潮。国民党中央发表了声明煽动大陆同胞起来“迫使中共放弃四个坚持，并进而推翻中共”，同时宣布要募捐１亿美元来“支援大陆民运”，以促进“民运”目标的实现。
    台湾当局的喉舌《中央日报》等报纸在这期间连篇累牍地报道了许多所谓“大陆新闻”，用谎言覆盖了版面；台湾国民党官方的“中国广播公司”增加了四个短波频率对大陆进行全天２４小时播音；台湾三家电视台也延长了新闻播出时间。台湾的谣言制造者们不但集“美国之音”、香港报刊谣言之大成，而且作了许多发挥。例如６月５日《中央日报》等台湾报纸分别以“血在流，肉在飞，万人殉难天安门”、“北京腥风血雨伤亡超过两万人”、“天安门前碧血成河”等醒目通栏标题编造了耸人听闻的谣言。有的报道甚至说，在天安门广场“当坦克轧上帐篷时，部分学生还在睡梦中”，忘掉了当时竟然还有什么人能在天安门广场上处于“睡梦”之中。
    据台湾报纸报道，在北京动乱期间，国民党当局曾多次召开中央常委会和高层会议研究反共策略。特别是反革命暴乱被粉碎之后，台湾当局公开声言“光复大陆指日可待”，要“鼓励大陆同胞更勇敢地起来反抗共产政权，以政治反攻摧毁中共”。同时台湾当局策划了一系列的反共活动，如邀集岛内一些反共学术团体举办所谓“关怀大陆学生民主运动座谈会”，成立“文宣研究设计小组”强化台湾新闻界的反共宣传，台湾“中国青年反共救国团”组织了有１００万人参加的所谓“手拉手、心连心”的反共示威活动。在６月初召开的国民党十三届二中全会上，有人发起成立“１亿美元支持大陆民主自由运动基金”，并以国民党中央名义设立了专户。在海外，台湾当局通过其驻外机构煽动一些华侨社团频频组织反共游行，并策动、资助形形色色的反共分子回大陆从事非法活动。
    特别值得警惕的是，台湾特务机构在此期间指示其潜伏在大陆的特务分子并临时派遣特务来大陆加紧活动，插手动乱。６月１１日，国民党中央大陆工作会主任萧昌乐直言不讳地说，“大陆地区的民运，就是因应我们对大陆工作的绩效最好证明”，因此中共“将箭头指向台湾，我们没有必要否认。”
