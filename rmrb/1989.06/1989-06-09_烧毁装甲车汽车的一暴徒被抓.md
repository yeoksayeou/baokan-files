Steering Committee of the Martial Law Troops News Office: The counter-revolutionary rioter Lu Zhongshu, who burned multiple armored vehicles and cars on the night of June 3, was captured by a unit of the martial law troops on the night of June 6.

Upon interrogation by the public security authorities, Lu Zhongshu confessed: On the night of June 3, he poured gasoline onto military vehicles in front of the Beijing Railway Bureau on Fuxing Road while the uninformed masses were blocking the military vehicles. He then used a lighter to set them on fire, destroying multiple armored vehicles and trucks. On the night of June 6 at 8 PM, he attempted to infiltrate the Military Museum to burn more military vehicles but was captured on the spot by the martial law troops.

The rioter Lu Zhongshu is a farmer from Gu'an County, Hebei Province. This individual was detained by the public security authorities in 1984 for hooliganism.
