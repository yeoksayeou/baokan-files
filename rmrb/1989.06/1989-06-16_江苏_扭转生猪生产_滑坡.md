Jiangsu Reverses the "Slippery Slope" of Pig Production

According to Xinhua News Agency, Nanjing, June 16 - (Reporter Sun Can) Jiangsu Province has taken measures to reverse the "slippery slope" of pig production.

According to relevant departments in the province, as of April this year, Jiangsu Province had a pig inventory of over 16.9 million heads, with a slight increase in the inventory of meat pigs and sows. However, with the arrival of the off-season for pork consumption, the contradiction between supply and demand has become increasingly prominent, and some places are currently showing signs of "difficulty in selling pigs." At the same time, feed prices have risen. Currently, some pig farmers have started to slaughter sows, and the production of breeding pigs in 44 livestock farms across the province is also showing signs of decline.

In response, the Jiangsu Provincial Government and relevant departments such as commerce and animal husbandry have recently taken various measures to prevent the "slippery slope" of pig production:

	* Increase funds for pig purchases to ensure that pigs are purchased without issuing "blank checks";
	* Actively organize the export of pork to increase inventory and alleviate the problem of "difficulty in selling pigs";
	* Cities should sell more fresh meat and lean meat to attract consumption;
	* Strengthen the construction of pig farming bases and expand the production capacity of state-owned commercial food departments' pig farming bases.

　　江苏  扭转生猪生产“滑坡”
    据新华社南京６月１６日电  （记者孙参）江苏省采取措施，扭转生猪生产再度“滑坡”。
    据省有关部门介绍，今年４月，江苏省的生猪存栏数达１６９０多万头，肉猪、母猪的存栏量有所回升。但随着猪肉消费淡季的到来，生猪产大于销的矛盾日益突出，一些地方目前出现“卖猪难”的苗头。同时，饲料价格上涨。目前，一些养猪户开始宰杀母猪，全省４４个畜种场的种猪生产也呈萎缩趋势。
    对此，江苏省政府及省商业、畜牧等部门最近多方采取措施，防止生猪生产“滑坡”：
    ——增加生猪收购资金，确保生猪收购不打“白条”；
    ——积极组织猪肉外调，增加库存量，缓解“卖猪难”问题；
    ——城市多卖鲜肉、瘦肉，吸引消费；
    ——抓好养猪基地建设，扩大国营商业食品部门养猪基地的生产量。
