Representatives of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and Overseas Chinese relatives, including Zhang Guoji, the chairman, and vice-chairmen Zhuang Mingli, Zhuang Yanlin, and Huang Junjun, along with advisor Zhang Chulin, visited and comforted the troops of a certain unit under martial law this afternoon on behalf of the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese and the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese and their relatives.

Zhang Guoji stated that we, the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese and their relatives, firmly support the wise decision made by the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission. At present, a small group of bad elements are still unwilling to admit defeat, and there are still many rumors circulating abroad. We must actively write letters to our overseas relatives through the broad masses of returned overseas Chinese and their relatives, informing them of the truth about suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot and exposing the rumors to dispel their doubts.

The troops of a certain unit under martial law expressed their determination not to disappoint the people's expectations and to continue the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary riot to the end.

In recent days, leaders, faculty, and student representatives from universities in the capital have been visiting the martial law troops' stations to comfort the soldiers and police officers of the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the public security officers who have made immortal contributions to suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital.

On June 10, the leadership of Beijing Institute of Technology, along with staff members, visited the soldiers of a certain unit of the Beijing Military Region who guarded the ammunition depot during the riot in Beijing. On June 12, leaders from more than 50 universities in Beijing jointly visited the martial law troops stationed at Beijing Institute of Physical Education, and were warmly welcomed by the soldiers.

Students and teachers from Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, located on Xueyuan Road, voluntarily provided breakfast for the soldiers of a certain artillery regiment patrolling the road. On June 12, the school leadership, along with faculty and staff, visited the officers and soldiers of this unit and provided them with folding chairs for resting during their duties.

On June 14, the party and administrative leaders of Peking University, Beijing Normal University, and Renmin University of China, along with representatives from various departments within the schools, totaling more than 40 people, visited the martial law troops stationed at the Capital Gymnasium.

In addition, leaders and student representatives from Tsinghua University, Beijing Foreign Studies University, Beijing Normal College, Central University for Nationalities, Northern Jiaotong University, Beijing Medical University, and Beijing University of Science and Technology also visited the soldiers and police officers of the martial law troops.
