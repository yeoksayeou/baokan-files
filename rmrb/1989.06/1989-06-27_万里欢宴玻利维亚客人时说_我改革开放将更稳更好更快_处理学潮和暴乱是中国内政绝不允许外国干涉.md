	Wan Li, while hosting a banquet for Bolivian guests, stated that China's reform and opening up will be more stable, better, and faster. He emphasized that handling the student movement and riots is China's internal affair and does not allow foreign interference.

	New China News Agency, Beijing, June 27 (Reporter: Yang Guangqiang) - Today, Wan Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, emphasized that China's independent and peaceful foreign policy will not change, and the policy of reform and opening up will not change. After summarizing experiences and correcting past mistakes, the steps of reform and opening up will be more stable, better, and even faster in the future.

	At the banquet welcoming the delegation led by Senator President Siro Humberto and House Speaker Walter Soriano, Wan Li said that recently, a few people in China used the student movement to stir up a serious social unrest, which developed into a counter-revolutionary riot. They attempted to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China, subvert the socialist People's Republic of China, and make China a vassal of imperialism again.

	Wan Li pointed out that their plot failed, and this counter-revolutionary riot ended in failure. "The Chinese government is stable and effectively controls the national situation. This incident prompted us to calmly summarize the past and consider the future."

	Before the banquet, Wan Li also pointed out during a meeting with the delegation that handling the student movement and riots is China's internal affair. Some countries that love to interfere in the internal affairs of others have made a big deal out of this, which is absolutely unacceptable.

	In his speech at the banquet, Wan Li also talked about the friendly relations between China and Bolivia. He said that both China and Bolivia are developing countries and belong to the Third World, facing the common tasks of developing the economy, improving people's living standards, and maintaining world peace. "This is an important foundation for the continuous development of friendly cooperation between the two countries."

	He also specially mentioned the positive role played by the Bolivian Parliament in promoting the development of relations between China and Bolivia.

	Senator President Siro Humberto, in his reply, reaffirmed Bolivia's government's adherence to the principles and stance of national self-determination, self-reliance in building the country, and opposition to foreign interference. He said that Bolivia has long maintained friendly relations with China on the basis of mutual respect and hopes that this visit will contribute to consolidating and developing the relationship and understanding between the peoples and governments of the two countries.

	He also conveyed the greetings of Bolivian President Paz Estenssoro to Chairman Yang Shangkun and Chairman Wan Li.

	The Bolivian guests arrived in Beijing last night at the invitation of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress. Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Alpho Alwang Jinmei, and others went to the airport to welcome them. Alpho Alwang Jinmei also attended tonight's meeting and banquet.

　　万里欢宴玻利维亚客人时说    
    我改革开放将更稳更好更快   
    处理学潮和暴乱是中国内政绝不允许外国干涉
    新华社北京６月２７日电（记者杨国强）全国人大常委会委员长万里今天在这里强调说，中国奉行的独立自主的和平外交政策不会改变，改革开放的政策不会改变。经过总结经验，纠正过去工作中的某些失误，今后改革开放的步子将迈得更稳、更好、甚至更快。
    万里在欢迎由参议长西罗·洪堡和众议长瓦尔特·索里亚诺率领的玻利维亚国会代表团的宴会上说，前不久，中国极少数人利用学潮掀起了一场严重的社会动乱，并发展为反革命暴乱，妄图推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义的中华人民共和国，使中国重新沦为帝国主义的附庸。
    万里指出，他们的阴谋没有得逞，这场反革命暴乱以失败而告终。“中国政府是稳定的，有效地控制着全国局势。这次事件促使我们冷静地总结过去和考虑未来。”
    万里委员长在宴会前会见代表团时还指出，处理学潮和暴乱是中国的内政，某些爱干涉别国内政的国家对此大作文章，这是绝对不能允许的。
    万里在宴会致辞中谈到了中、玻友好关系。他说，中、玻两国都是发展中国家，同属第三世界，面临着发展经济建设、提高人民生活水平和维护世界和平的共同任务。“这是两国友好合作关系能够不断发展的重要基础。”
    他还特别谈到了玻利维亚议会为推动中、玻两国关系的发展所起的积极的作用。
    参议长西罗·洪堡在答辞中重申了玻利维亚政府坚持民族自决，自主建设自己的国家，反对外来干涉的原则和立场。他说，玻利维亚多年来一直在相互尊重的基础上保持同中国的友好关系，希望这次访问为巩固和发展两国人民和政府之间的关系和理解作出贡献。
    他还转达了玻利维亚总统帕斯·埃斯登索罗对杨尚昆主席和万里委员长的问候。
    玻利维亚客人们是应全国人大常委会的邀请于昨晚抵京的。全国人大常委会副委员长阿沛·阿旺晋美等前往机场迎接。阿沛·阿旺晋美还出席了今晚的会见和宴会。
