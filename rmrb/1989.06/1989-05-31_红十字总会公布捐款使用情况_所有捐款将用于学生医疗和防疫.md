From May 17 to 29, the China Red Cross Society received donations totaling over 800,000 yuan (including 150,000 Hong Kong dollars converted to RMB) from various sectors of society for the rescue of students who were fasting and sitting in Tiananmen Square. According to the wishes of the donating units (individuals), nearly 200,000 yuan has been spent on purchasing medicines, blankets, hats, towels, brooms, disposable paper cups, various beverages, bread, biscuits, toilet paper, sanitary napkins, and quick-disinfecting wipes for the students. The remaining donations are used to compensate the medical, sanitation, and epidemic prevention units participating in the rescue of students. As the rescue work, especially the large-scale epidemic prevention work, is still ongoing, a small amount of donations will be temporarily retained by the China Red Cross Society for overall coordination and use. In summary, all donations will be used for the medical rescue and health epidemic prevention work for the students.
