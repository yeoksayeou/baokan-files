To further implement the "Several Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on Further Promoting the Arts," the Bureau of Literature and Art of the Central Propaganda Department and the Propaganda Department of the Shandong Provincial Committee recently jointly held a seminar on the theory of the development of culture and arts in a commodity economy in Yantai City.

Participants at the meeting agreed that the development of a commodity economy has made culture and arts vibrant and diverse, but because the impact of the commodity economy occurred without any institutional preparation in the cultural and artistic fields, and both material and ideological preparations were insufficient, it has led to many difficulties and contradictions, resulting in widespread confusion and anxiety. For example, the diversity and progressiveness brought by the development of a commodity economy coexist with irrationality and disorder, the loss of control in some aspects of the cultural market and the conflict with social benefits, the contradiction between artists' pursuit of artistic aesthetic values and the influence of commodity consciousness, and so on. The intertwining of these various contradictions makes the choice for culture and arts difficult. The resolution of these problems is directly related to the survival and development of the cultural and artistic undertakings in our country, and has both theoretical and practical significance.

Comrades in their speeches pointed out that to solve these contradictions, to get out of the current predicament of the survival and development of culture and arts, and to make the right choice, the most urgent task is to do two things: First, we must clarify the basic concepts and categories of the relationship between commodity economy and the development of the arts. For example, the question of whether artistic products are commodities has three views: Those who believe that artistic products are commodities argue that cultural and artistic products are labor products provided to others for sale, entering the circulation domain and being constrained by the cultural market, so they are commodities. Those who hold the opposite view argue that the objects of cultural and artistic effects are the human spirit, some of which have class characteristics, and moreover, artistic production cannot estimate its socially necessary labor time, so it cannot be measured by a general equivalent, so it is not a commodity. More people believe that artistic products have two attributes, one side of which is commodity attributes, and the other side is non-commodity attributes. The issue of the two benefits is also like this, with a consistent side and a contradictory side. Therefore, how to grasp the relationship between these two attributes and two benefits is crucial to the healthy development of culture and arts. Second, to do a good job in formulating and implementing cultural economic policies. Everyone thinks that there are many problems in this area at present. For example, we often emphasize that the artistic production sector should put social benefits first, but in some financial and tax policies, we equate them with general material production sectors, so this requirement is difficult to implement.

At the seminar, everyone agreed that the contradictions between commodity economy and the development of the arts can be resolved by adhering to the line of the 13th Party Congress, upholding the four cardinal principles, and adhering to reform and opening up, ensuring a stable and united environment, and while vigorously developing the commodity economy, carrying out the matching reforms of the arts system, and under stable social conditions, promoting the further prosperity and development of socialist arts through solid work. The most important thing at present is for the relevant decision-making departments to accelerate the formulation of cultural economic policies and cultural regulations.

Participants at this seminar included more than 40 writers, scholars, professors, entrepreneurs, and responsible comrades from propaganda and art units in the capital and some provinces and cities.

　　在发展商品经济条件下繁荣文艺
    中宣部文艺局和山东省委宣传部联合召开研讨会
    新华社北京电  为了进一步贯彻落实《中共中央关于进一步繁荣文艺的若干意见》，中宣部文艺局和山东省委宣传部最近在烟台市联合召开了商品经济与文化艺术发展理论研讨会。
    与会同志认为，商品经济的发展使文化艺术呈现出丰富多彩、多样求进的繁荣景象，同时由于商品经济的冲击是在文化艺术领域没有任何体制准备的情况下出现的，物质准备与思想准备也相当地不充分，从而造成了许多困难与矛盾，产生了普遍的困惑与焦虑状态。例如商品经济的发展所带来的文化背景的多样求进同非理性、无序性并存的矛盾，文化市场的某些失控现象同社会效益的矛盾，文学艺术家对艺术审美价值的理想追求同商品意识影响的矛盾等等。多种矛盾交错并存使文化艺术面临着艰难的选择。这些问题的解决与否已直接关系到文化艺术事业在我国的生存与发展，不仅具有理论意义，而且具有重要的实践意义。
    同志们在发言中指出，要解决这些矛盾，摆脱目前文化艺术的生存与发展的困境并做出正确选择，当务之急要做好两件事情：第一，首先要在理论上搞清楚商品经济与文艺发展的一些基本概念与范畴。例如关于文艺产品到底是不是商品的问题，现在有三种观点：认为文艺产品是商品的人认为，文化艺术产品是为别人提供的、供出卖的劳动产品，要进入流通领域，要受文化市场的制约，所以它是商品。持相反观点的人认为，文化艺术的作用对象是人的精神，有些还有阶级性，况且艺术生产也无法估算其社会必要劳动时间，不可能用一般等价物来衡量，所以它不是商品。更多的人则认为文艺产品具有两重属性，有商品属性的一面，也有非商品属性的一面。两个效益的问题也是这样，有一致的一面，有矛盾的一面。所以如何把握这两重属性和两个效益的关系对文化艺术的健康发展至关重要。第二，搞好文化经济政策的制定与执行工作。大家认为目前这方面的问题比较大。例如我们经常强调艺术生产部门要把社会效益放在首位，但在某些财政税收政策上却把它们混同于一般物质生产部门，因此这个要求很难落到实处。
    在研讨会上，大家共同的认识是，商品经济与文艺发展的矛盾要得到解决，关键是要在党的十三大路线指引下，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革与开放，保证有一个安定团结的环境，在大力发展商品经济的同时搞好文艺体制的配套改革，在稳定的社会条件下，用扎实的工作促使社会主义文艺的进一步繁荣与发展。目前最重要的是，有关决策部门要加快制定文化经济政策和文化法规的步伐。
    参加这次研讨会的，有首都及部分省市的作家、学者、教授、企业家及宣传文艺单位的负责同志共４０余人。
