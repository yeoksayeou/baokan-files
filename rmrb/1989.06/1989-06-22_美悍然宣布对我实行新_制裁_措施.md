The U.S. brazenly announces new "sanctions" against us

New York, June 20th - The White House spokesman, Fitzwater, announced in a written statement today that President Bush has instructed the U.S. government to take new "sanction" measures against China, attempting to further exert political and economic pressure on China.

Fitzwater said: "The President has today instructed the U.S. government to stop all high-level contacts with officials of the People's Republic of China." He also said: "In addition to the ban on contacts, the U.S. will seek to have international financial institutions delay consideration of new loans to China."

After China suppressed the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, U.S. President Bush announced on June 5th that the U.S. would take five "sanction" measures against China, including the suspension of arms sales and mutual visits between military leaders of China and the U.S.

　　美悍然宣布对我实行新“制裁”措施
    新华社华盛顿６月２０日电  美国白宫发言人菲茨沃特２０日在一份书面声明中宣布布什总统已指示美国政府对中国采取新的“制裁”措施，试图进一步在政治和经济上对中国施加压力。
    菲茨沃特说：“总统今天指示美国政府停止参加与中华人民共和国政府官员的所有高层接触。”他还说：“除禁止接触外，美国将寻求国际金融机构推迟考虑向中国提供新的贷款。”
    在中国平息在北京发生的反革命暴乱后，美国总统布什６月５日就宣布对中国采取５项“制裁”措施，包括暂停武器出售和中、美军事领导人之间的互访等。
