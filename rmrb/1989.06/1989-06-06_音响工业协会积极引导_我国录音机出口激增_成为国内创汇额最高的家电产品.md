	The Audio Industry Association Actively Guides the Surge in Export of Cassette Players in China, Becoming the Domestic Electrical Appliance Product with the Highest Foreign Exchange Earnings

	Our reporter, Cuī Xiùzhī, reports: After 10 years of effort, China's cassette player industry has made significant progress and has now embarked on a path of healthy development. Last year, the national export of cassette players earned 224 million US dollars in foreign exchange, making it the domestic electrical appliance product with the highest foreign exchange earnings.

	Electronic audio equipment is a knowledge-intensive and technology-intensive industry with extensive cooperation and matching. Often, there are problems that individual enterprises cannot solve independently, requiring the entire industry to coordinate. In 1981, the China Electronics Industry Audio Association developed from the "National Cassette Player Industry Inter-Enterprise Competition Committee," focusing on enterprise needs, adhering to two-way service, and transforming the industry association from primarily technical content to the entire operational activities, assisting government departments in industry management and assuming functions.

	During the tenure of the second council, the industry faced a serious situation where production exceeded sales and inventory increased significantly. The council proposed a series of industry strategies in response to the situation. On one hand, it quickly reported the situation to relevant national departments and local electronic industry management departments, calling for control of the trend of expanding production points, and on the other hand, it held information release meetings to prevent enterprises from blindly expanding production, voluntarily adjusting plans, actively developing rural markets, and accelerating entry into international markets. Due to effective measures, the audio industry emerged from the "low point."

	In terms of focusing on the international market, the Audio Industry Association timely provided international market information, making enterprise leaders clear-headed and informed, and promoting the spirit of "everyone's business is everyone's responsibility." They coordinated and assisted enterprises in exporting products. Facing the situation where the cost of complete machine products was high and exports were severely loss-making, the association, from a holistic perspective, negotiated multiple times with some motor factories, making the motor factories voluntarily reduce the price of TN33 motors by 9%, enhancing the export competitiveness of complete machine products. They also organized complete machine factories and component factories into a "one-stop" operation, with the support of foreign trade departments, providing components to complete machine factories for export products at foreign trade export prices, reducing the cost of each product by tens of yuan, and striving to export more and earn more foreign exchange. The Cassette Player Head Association, to avoid chaos in exports, set the lowest export sales price for 11 enterprises in the industry, jointly abiding by it, and penalizing violators. It also stipulated that each enterprise's minimum annual export volume should be 15% of the total annual production, with bonuses for exceeding the quota, making industry management institutionalized, standardized, and scientific, helping enterprises to participate in the international cycle in the most advantageous form.

	The 8-year work of the China Audio Industry Association has proven that industry associations are vital. Compared to other daily electronic appliance manufacturing industries, the cassette player industry has less investment, more output; less foreign exchange used, more foreign exchange earned; less blind introduction, faster domestication; stable production growth, stable prices with a downward trend, from large-scale imports to large-scale exports, from exporting primary products to exporting mid-level products, forming a scale economy, and beginning to develop steadily. By the end of last year, the nationwide inventory of cassette players was 5.2 million units, a 34.7% decrease from the inventory at the end of 1987. Additionally, 17 enterprises primarily producing electronic audio products have entered the ranks of the top 100 electronic enterprises of the Ministry of Electronics.

### 音响工业协会积极引导  我国录音机出口激增  成为国内创汇额最高的家电产品

　　音响工业协会积极引导
    我国录音机出口激增
    成为国内创汇额最高的家电产品
    本报讯  记者崔秀芝报道：我国录音机行业经过１０年努力，有了长足进步，现已走上了健康发展的道路。去年，全国录音机出口创汇达２．２４亿美元，成为国内家电产品创汇额最高的产品。
    电子音响是一个知识、技术密集型的行业，协作配套十分广泛，常有一些单个企业难以独立解决的问题，需要全行业进行协调。１９８１年，中国电子工业音响协会在“全国录音机行业厂际竞赛委员会”的基础上发展起来，着眼于企业需要，坚持双向服务，使行业协会从以技术为主要内容，转到整个经营活动上来，转到协助政府部门进行行业管理和承担职能上来。
    第二届理事会任职期间，适逢全国录音机产大于销、库存量大增的严重情况。理事会针对现状，提出一系列行业对策，一方面迅速向国家有关部门和各地方电子工业主管部门通报情况，呼吁控制扩点扩产趋势，另一方面，召开信息发布会，使企业不要盲目扩大生产，自觉调整计划，努力开辟农村市场，加速打入国际市场。由于措施得力，音响行业走出了“低谷”。
    在以国际市场为主攻目标方面，音响工业协会及时提供国际市场信息，让企业领导头脑清醒、心中有数，发扬“大家的事情大家做”的好作风，协调和帮助企业将产品出口。针对整机产品成本高、出口亏损严重的情况，协会从全局出发，多次与一些机芯厂协商，使机芯厂主动将ＴＮ３３机芯的价格降低９％，增强整机产品的出口竞争力。他们还将整机厂和零部件厂组成“一条龙”，在外贸部门的支持下，零部件按外贸出口价格为整机厂的出口产品配套，使每台产品成本下降十几元，争取多出口创汇。录音机磁头分会为了避免出口打乱仗，对行业中的１１个企业制定了出口销售的最低价格，共同遵守，违者受罚。并规定各企业年出口量最低为年总产量１５％，超额出口给予奖励，使行业管理走上制度化、规范化、科学化，帮助企业以最有利的形式，参加到国际大循环中去。
    中国音响工业协会８年来的工作证明，行业协会是有生命力的。与其它一些日用电子器具制造业相比，录音机行业投入较少，产出较多；用汇较少，创汇较多；盲目引进较少，国产化进程较快；生产稳步增长，价格稳中有降，从大量进口到大量出口，从初级产品出口过渡到中等水平出口，形成了规模经济，开始稳步发展。去年底，全国收录机的工商库存量为５２０万台，比１９８７年底库存量下降３４．７％，并有１７家以生产电子音响产品为主的企业，跨入机电部电子百家企业行列之中。
