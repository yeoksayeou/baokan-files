High Technology Goes Mainstream

— Observations from the Japanese New Materials Exhibition

Surrounding the "1989 New Materials Exhibition" held from June 13th to 17th in Tokyo's Sunshine City, related publications have sparked a wave of popularization and promotion of new materials science and technology: "New materials are the driving force behind technological innovation." "New materials are the foundation of high-tech industries."

The distinctive feature of this new materials exhibition is that, as one of the three major foundational high technologies, new materials are increasingly permeating the daily lives of Japanese people, and the phenomenon of high-tech going mainstream is progressing rapidly.

Shape memory alloys are one of the new metal materials. They first appeared in the United States, developed by the U.S. Air Force for military purposes. In Japan, this new metal was still in the research and development stage a few years ago and was only used to make educational exhibits like automatic water wheels and self-opening flowers. Now, at the exhibition, life and industrial products made from this new material are everywhere, such as shape memory alloy bras, orthodontic wires, automatic sunroofs, pipe joints, and springs.

Visitors to the exhibition can see a variety of new ceramics, such as silicon carbide, silicon nitride, rare earth oxides, aluminum oxide, boron nitride, new types of glass, synthetic silicon, and more. There are also various mechanical parts and everyday items made from new ceramics. These items occupy a significant portion of the entire exhibition, indicating Japan's strong capabilities in this high-tech field.

Engineering plastics are also being increasingly applied in aerospace, aviation, automobiles, energy, and other sectors to replace and conserve expensive metals like steel and aluminum. These products are also quite eye-catching at the exhibition. Composite materials made from carbon fiber, metals, and new ceramics as reinforcing materials are one of the new materials Japan has been actively developing in recent years. It is reported that in the structural materials for the next-generation support fighter jet—F-SX, jointly developed by Japan and the U.S., 50% will use new composite materials. The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency is currently developing composite materials that can withstand temperatures of 1700 degrees Celsius for the spacecraft to be launched in 1995. This new material is made by soaking carbon fiber in phenol, then covering it with a layer of silicon carbide or silica after sintering. It is said to be lighter and more durable than the heat-resistant materials currently used on U.S. spacecraft.

The exhibition also features various high-temperature superconducting materials, biotechnology materials, and innovative products like color-changing textiles, amorphous thin-film jewelry, and hydrogen storage batteries.

The reporter noticed that most of the exhibitors showcasing the aforementioned new materials and new material products are large traditional industries known as "sunset industries," such as steel, textiles, petrochemicals, cement, shipbuilding, and non-ferrous metal smelting. This is because the two "oil crises" led to significant increases in energy and raw material prices, causing these industries to fall into long-term "structural stagnation." This predicament forced companies to implement thorough rationalization measures, maximize production automation, and adopt diversified business strategies, actively researching and developing new materials technologies.

### 高技术　大众化——日本新材料展览会观感

　　高技术　大众化   
    ——日本新材料展览会观感
    据新华社东京电（记者张可喜）围绕着１３日至１７日在东京阳光城举行的“１９８９年新材料展”，有关报刊掀起了一个新材料科学技术的宣传普及高潮：“新材料是技术革新的原动力。”“新材料是高技术产业的基础。”……
    这次新材料展的特点是，作为三大基础性高技术之一，新材料正在渗透到日本人的日常生活之中，高科技大众化现象进展迅速。
    形状记忆合金是新金属材料之一。它首先出现在美国，是美国空军出于军用目的而研制出来的。在日本，这种新金属数年前还处在研制阶段，当时只用来制作自动水车、自开花朵等科普性展品。如今在展览会上，用这种新材料制成的生活和工业用品已比比皆是，如带形状记忆合金的乳罩、齿列矫正用钢丝、自动天窗、管道接口和弹簧等。
    人们在展览会上可以看到种类繁多的新陶瓷，如碳化硅、氮化硅、稀土类氧化物、氧化铝、氮化硼、新型玻璃、合成硅等等，还有用新陶瓷制造出来的各种机械零部件、刀剪等生活用品。这些在整个展览会上占了相当大比例，说明日本在这一高技术项目上拥有强大实力。
    工程塑料也正在越来越多地被应用在航空、航天、汽车、能源等方面，以取代和节约价格昂贵的钢铁和铝等金属。这些产品在展览会上也很引人注目。用碳纤维、金属和新陶瓷作增强材料的工程塑料叫做复合材料，是近年来日本积极发展的新材料之一。据介绍，在日美决定联合研制的新一代支援战斗机—ＦＳＸ的结构材料中，将有５０％使用新型复合材料。日本宇宙开发事业团为制造１９９５年发射的航天飞机，目前正在研制耐１７００摄氏度高温的复合材料。这种新材料是用苯酚浸泡的碳纤维，在烧结后再包覆以碳化硅或氧化硅膜。据说，它比目前美国航天飞机上使用的耐热材料还轻而且坚固。
    展览会上展出的还有各种高温超导材料、生物技术材料及使人耳目一新的变色纺织品、非晶质薄膜首饰和蓄氢电池等新材料产品。
    记者注意到，展出上述新材料及新材料制品的大都是被称为“夕阳产业”的传统产业，如钢铁、纺织、石化、水泥、造船、有色金属冶炼等行业的大厂家。这是因为，两次“石油危机”带来能源和原材料价格的大幅度上涨，使上述各行业陷于长期的“结构性萧条”之中。这种困境迫使企业推进彻底的合理化措施，最大限度地实现生产自动化，同时实施多种经营战略，积极研究开发新材料技术。
