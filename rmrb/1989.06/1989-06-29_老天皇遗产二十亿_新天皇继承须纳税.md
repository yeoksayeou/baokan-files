The estate of the late Emperor Hirohito is worth 20 billion yen, and Emperor Akihito will have to pay 4.6 billion yen in inheritance tax upon inheriting it, according to a report by the *Nihon Keizai Shimbun* today.

The report states that, according to an order from the Allied occupation forces to abolish the imperial family's assets, Hirohito only retained 15 million yen in cash and some personal items such as jewels and artworks after the war. The Imperial Household Agency used this 15 million yen as a base and, with the surplus from the annual imperial allowance, purchased stocks and other securities. By the time of Hirohito's death, this amount had grown to approximately 20 billion yen.

According to Japanese civil law, there are 11 heirs to Hirohito's estate, including the Empress Dowager and Emperor Akihito. In order to minimize inheritance tax, the Imperial Household Agency hopes that relatives other than the Empress Dowager and Emperor Akihito will waive their inheritance rights. This is because the Empress Dowager is exempt from taxation on her inheritance. Therefore, the other half of the estate that Emperor Akihito inherits will be subject to an inheritance tax of 4.6 billion yen, according to Japanese civil law.

　　老天皇遗产二十亿  新天皇继承须纳税
    新华社东京６月２８日电  据《日本经济新闻》今天报道，已故裕仁天皇所留遗产多达２０亿日元，明仁天皇继承时需交纳４．６亿日元的遗产继承税。
    报道说，根据盟军司令部关于取消皇室财产的命令，裕仁天皇在战后仅持有１５００万日元现金和一些宝石、美术品等私人财产。宫内厅以这１５００万日元现金为基础，再加上每年国库支出的皇室费的节余部分，购买了股票等有价证券，到裕仁天皇去逝时，这笔财产已增加到大约２０亿日元。
    按照日本民法规定，裕仁天皇这笔遗产的继承人有皇太后、明仁天皇等共１１人。出于少交继承税的考虑，宫内厅希望皇太后和明仁天皇以外的亲属放弃继承权。因为皇太后继承遗产可以免予课税。这样，明仁天皇继承的另一半遗产，根据日本民法规定，需交纳继承税４．６亿日元。
