	National People's Congress Standing Committee member Li Gui recently wrote a letter to Xinhua News Agency to clarify the matter reported by the Hong Kong Wen Wei Po regarding the signing of NPC Standing Committee members. The full text of the letter is as follows:

	Xinhua News Agency Editorial Department:

	I recently learned that on May 25, Wen Wei Po published on its first page the news that 57 members of the National People's Congress Standing Committee jointly requested an emergency meeting of the NPC Standing Committee, listing my name among them. I have never signed such a document; it is purely fabricated. I write this letter to expose the truth and set the record straight.

　　人大常委李贵写信说
    根本没参加过“签名”
    新华社北京６月１３日电  全国人大常委会委员李贵最近给本社来信，澄清香港《文汇报》报道的有关人大常委会委员签名一事。信件全文如下：新华社总编室：
    最近才知道文汇报５月２５日在第一版刊登了所谓５７名全国人大常委会委员联名要求召开人大常委紧急会议的消息，其中列有我的名字，我根本没有签过名，纯属捏造，希写此信予以披露，以正视听。
