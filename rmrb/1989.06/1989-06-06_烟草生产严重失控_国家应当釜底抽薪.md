    Tobacco production in our country has already become severely out of control. If we do not take effective measures to address this issue at its root, we will surely regret it, just like we did in the 1950s when we failed to control population growth!

    According to a recent report from the _Market News_, data from the National Bureau of Statistics indicates that in 21 provinces producing flue-cured tobacco, a survey of 77,000 households showed that this year's flue-cured tobacco planting area increased by 19.2% on top of last year's 40% growth. Based on this, it is estimated that this year's national flue-cured tobacco planting area will reach over 23 million mu. From the 1950s to the present, China's population has doubled, while cigarette sales have increased tenfold. Additionally, a significant number of farmers who do not smoke cigarettes smoke tobacco leaves. Over the past 20 years, China's tobacco industry has developed rapidly at an average annual growth rate of 10%, becoming the world's top producer and consumer of tobacco. Currently, there are approximately 250 million smokers in the country, and including passive smokers, about 700 million people are directly or indirectly affected by the hazards of tobacco. Not to mention the health hazards of tobacco, just considering the planting area of flue-cured tobacco this year, at least 11.5 million tons of grain planting area will be displaced, equivalent to one month's worth of food for the entire population.

    More worrying is that some local governments' actions are promoting the blind development of tobacco production. Tobacco is a high-tax, high-profit commodity, and producing tobacco can open up tax sources for local governments and increase local financial revenue. Some local governments, driven by local interests, encourage or force farmers to develop flue-cured tobacco production. Jiangxi, in order to collect a 38% tobacco leaf tax, disregards natural and economic conditions and uses administrative measures to force planting. It is estimated that this year's provincial flue-cured tobacco planting area will increase by more than 30% compared to last year. Even more extreme, some places in Henan adopt harsh measures such as fining 100 yuan for not planting one mu of tobacco, implementing these measures household by household. As a result, the province's flue-cured tobacco planting area, which increased by 27.7% last year, has increased by another 16.7%. The severe lack of control in tobacco production has disrupted the rational planting structure and is extremely inconsistent with the overall development of the national economy. Those with foresight believe that at the very least, the current production and sales volume should be reduced by half.

### 烟草生产严重失控  国家应当釜底抽薪

　　烟草生产严重失控
    国家应当釜底抽薪
    本报讯  我国烟草生产已经严重失控，如果不采取釜底抽薪的有效措施，必将像５０年代没有控制人口增长一样后悔莫及！
    《市场报》最近从国家统计局获悉，２１个烤烟生产省对７．７万农户种植安排情况的调查表明，今年我国烤烟种植面积在去年增长４０％的基础上，又扩种１９．２％。据此推算，今年全国烤烟种植面积将达２３００多万亩。自５０年代至今，我国人口增加约１倍，而卷烟销售猛增１０倍，还有相当一部分农民不抽卷烟而抽烟叶。近２０年来，我国烟草工业以年均递增１０％的速度迅猛发展，已成为烟草生产和消费的双料世界冠军。全国现有吸烟者约２．５亿人，加上被动吸烟者，直接或间接受到烟草危害的达７亿人。且不说烟草危害人类健康的后果，单说今年烤烟种植面积，至少挤掉１１５０万吨粮食的种植面积，相当于挤掉全国人口一个月的口粮。
    更令人忧虑的是，地方政府的一些做法促进烟草生产的盲目发展。烟草是高税高利商品，生产烟草能为地方开辟税源，增加地方财政收入。一些地方政府从局部利益出发，鼓励或强制农民发展烤烟生产。江西为了征收３８％的烟叶税，不顾自然条件、经济条件的限制，采取行政手段，强行种植，预计今年全省烤烟种植面积将比去年增长３０％以上。更有甚者，河南一些地方采取少种一亩烟，罚交税金１００元等强硬措施，逐村逐户落实，因而使全省的烤烟种植面积在去年增长２７．７％的基础上，又增长１６．７％。烟草生产严重失控的状况已经打乱了合理的种植结构，与整个国民经济发展极不协调。有识之士认为，至少应当压缩目前产销量的一半。
