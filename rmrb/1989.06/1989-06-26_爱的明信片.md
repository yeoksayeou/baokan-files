Title: A Postcard of Love

From their hands, we received the torch of love,
We will never let it be extinguished.
From individual proliferation, humanity has become a constellation,
All due to the eternity of love.

Sent, my soul, my eyes,
To see you, day and night, in dreams and reality.
Whether rain, snow, or fog,
I will always track you down.

Since having the faith of love,
The heart has learned to gaze.
Gazing through the setting sun,
Gazing into a group of statues.

Slipping out from the mother's swaddling clothes,
But love cannot be slipped out of.
Even in distant soaring,
Love still tracks the future.

Perhaps the first cry was not melodious,
But it was a moving love song.
Perhaps this cry summoned a kindred spirit,
Ending loneliness from then on.

专栏：

　　爱的明信片
    峭岩
    从他们手里接过爱的火把
    我们再也不肯熄灭
    人类从个体繁衍成一个星座
    皆由于爱的永恒
    寄去，我的心灵我的眼睛
    看你，夜以继日情里梦中
    不管阴雨雪雾
    我都将你追踪
    自从有了爱的信仰
    心儿就学会了凝望
    望穿一轮红日
    望成一群雕像
    从母亲的襁褓里滑出
    却滑不出爱
    即便是遥远的腾飞
    爱依然跟踪未来
    也许第一声歌啼并不嘹亮
    但却是一支动情的恋歌
    也许这一声唤来了知音
    从此结束了寂寞
