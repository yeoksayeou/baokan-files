	Coordinated Action, Concentrated Arrests, Maintaining Stability, Protecting the People
	Henan Continues to Strike Against Criminal Activities

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, June 25th - Recently, Henan Province has launched a campaign to crack down on criminal activities, primarily targeting mobile criminals, across the entire province. This follows the earlier campaign in the spring to combat serious criminal activities such as robbery, theft, and hooliganism, and is another struggle that has garnered widespread support and approval from the people.

	In March and April of this year, Henan Province conducted a large-scale campaign to crack down on serious criminal elements involved in robbery, theft, and hooliganism. By the end of April, the province had solved over 38,000 criminal cases, including 4,461 major and serious cases, and arrested over 28,000 criminals, effectively curbing the arrogance of criminal elements.

	According to the Henan Provincial Public Security Bureau, the province currently has nearly 10,000 registered mobile criminals, with 80% of them being fugitives with outstanding warrants, escapees from re-education through labor, or escapees from reform through labor. In response, the Provincial Party Committee and Government have ordered the public security, procuratorial, judicial, and legal departments to work closely together, using various means and methods to take coordinated action, concentrate on arrests, and resolutely implement the policy of severe and swift punishment to severely crack down on mobile criminals and other criminal elements.

	In late May, Henan Province organized a province-wide public security operation, arresting 6,267 criminals in one swoop. Including those arrested since May 1st, over 12,000 criminals of various types were arrested in May. Among them were notorious and wanted criminals, long-sought mobile criminals, human traffickers, and criminals involved in various types of crimes such as inducing, forcing, and harboring women into prostitution.

	In the effort to maintain social order, Henan Province has combined severe crackdowns with education and rehabilitation, and has also focused on political propaganda, promoting the policy of leniency for those who confess and severity for those who resist. Since March, 6,044 criminals have voluntarily surrendered, exposing several criminal gangs and providing leads on criminals, which has led to the solving of many major cases, important cases, and long-standing cases.

　　统一行动　集中抓捕　维护安定　保卫人民    
    河南连续打击刑事犯罪
    据新华社郑州６月２５日电  河南省不久前在全省范围内开展集中打击以流窜犯为主的刑事犯罪活动。这是继今春打击抢劫、盗窃、流氓滋扰等严重刑事犯罪活动之后，又一场得人心、顺民意的斗争。
    今年３、４月份，河南省开展了一场声势较大的集中打击抢劫、盗窃、流氓滋扰等严重犯罪分子的斗争。到４月底，全省共破获各类刑事案件３．８万多起，其中重特大案件４４６１起，抓捕罪犯２．８万多人，打击了犯罪分子的嚣张气焰。
    据河南省公安厅透露，全省目前在册流窜犯近万名，其中８０％是负案在逃、批捕在逃和劳改劳教逃跑人员。为此，省委、省政府要求全省公检法司密切配合，运用各种手段和方法，统一行动，集中抓捕，坚决做到依法从重从快，严厉打击流窜犯和各种犯罪分子。
    ５月下旬，河南省组织全省公安机关集中行动，一举抓捕犯罪分子６２６７名，加上５月１日以来陆续抓捕的罪犯，５月份共抓捕各种犯罪分子１．２万多名。其中包括一些罪恶累累的惯犯、要犯，久抓未获的流窜犯，拐卖妇女、儿童的人犯子和引诱、强迫、容留妇女卖淫等各种类型的犯罪分子。
    在狠抓社会治安中，河南省实行严厉打击与教育挽救相结合，并注意开展政治攻势，宣传坦白从宽、抗拒从严的政策。３月份以来，全省６０４４名犯罪分子主动投案自首，他们揭发了一批犯罪团伙，提供了犯罪分子的线索，使一批大案、要案和多年积案得到破获。
