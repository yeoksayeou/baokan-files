Argentine President Alfonsín and President-elect Menem met on May 31 to discuss the country's difficult situation and decided to take measures to stabilize the situation.

In a joint statement issued after the meeting, which contained 11 points, the two leaders agreed to establish a joint committee to review and adjust the 1989 national budget. They also agreed that the ruling party and Menem's Justice Party should form a joint delegation to travel to the United States to negotiate with international creditors over Argentina's $60 billion foreign debt.

In recent days, riots have occurred in the capital and some inland cities of Argentina. To maintain domestic order, President Alfonsín declared a 30-day state of siege on May 29. The Argentine Congress approved the government's state of siege on May 31.

Menem, in a press conference after the meeting, emphasized that the responsibility for the recent looting and riots lies not only with the instigators but also with the "difficult economic situation of the country."
