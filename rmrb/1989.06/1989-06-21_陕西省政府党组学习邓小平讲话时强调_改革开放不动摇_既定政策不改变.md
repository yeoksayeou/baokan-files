Shaanxi Provincial Governor Hou Zongbin presided over an expanded meeting of the provincial government's Party group on June 20th. The meeting thoroughly studied Deng Xiaoping's speech, calmly reviewed and summarized the experiences and lessons from the province's economic work over the past period, further solidified the resolve for reform and opening up and rectification, and clearly announced that the province's several major decisions made and formulated since last year will not be changed and will continue to be implemented.

In response to the current situation where some comrades are hesitant and waiting to see, Governor Hou Zongbin and several vice-governors stated that all reform measures proven by practice to promote the development of productive forces and to mobilize people's enthusiasm should be continued without wavering. To maintain the continuity of policies, they proposed "four unchanging principles": the overall policy of opening up to the outside world remains unchanged; the overall deployment of rectification remains unchanged; the economic layout and strategic principles of "focusing on the development of Guanzhong, actively developing Shannan and Shannbei" and "education as the foundation, science and technology for the development of Shaanxi" remain unchanged; important policies and measures taken for deepening reform remain unchanged.

To continue implementing the principles and deployments of reform, opening up, and rectification, the provincial government emphasized that the current focus should be on propaganda and explanation work for foreign investors and experts who have temporarily left Shaanxi, to encourage them to return as soon as possible; for those who have returned, they should be warmly welcomed and well-received, and their safety should be guaranteed; for old customers from various countries, they should be actively contacted to dispel their anxieties and welcome them to visit Shaanxi. At the same time, the economic structure should be further adjusted, the policy of having both support and control should be implemented, and the policy of tilting towards agriculture, energy, transportation, raw materials, and other basic industries, as well as tilting towards 50 major tax-paying enterprises and 46 key products, should be continued. The pilot work of 13 enterprises with advanced reforms should be continued, and large and medium-sized enterprises should be revitalized to promote the stable progress of the province's economy along the path of reform and opening up.
