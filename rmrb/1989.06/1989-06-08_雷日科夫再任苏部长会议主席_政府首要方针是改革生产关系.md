Ryzhkov Reappointed as Chairman of the Council of Ministers
The Government's Primary Policy is to Reform Production Relations

	The 59-year-old Ryzhkov was reappointed as Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the Soviet Union at the Supreme Soviet meeting on the morning of the 7th. The aforementioned appointment will be confirmed at the Soviet People's Congress on the 8th.

	The proposal to have Ryzhkov continue as Chairman of the Council of Ministers was made by Gorbachev, Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union. During the discussion of Ryzhkov's candidacy, the representatives raised numerous questions. Ryzhkov, in his response, said that the previous Council of Ministers had not made any mistakes in strategic and principle planning, but there were indeed mistakes in certain aspects of the work, such as the improvement of the economic mechanisms in basic construction and agriculture. He believed that these mistakes had a negative impact on the development of the national economy and caused social tension.

	The voting result of more than 500 people was 9 against and 31 abstentions. After the vote, Ryzhkov once again took the podium to thank the representatives for their trust. He said: I understand the complex situation the country is currently in, but I also know that only by moving forward can we solve the problems facing Soviet society. The road ahead will not be smooth, and the work will not be easy.

	At the Supreme Soviet meeting of the Soviet Union on the 7th, according to Gorbachev's proposal, Kolbin, the First Secretary of the Kazakh Party Central Committee, was elected as the Chairman of the Soviet People's Supervisory Committee.

	The 66-year-old Smolentsev was elected as the President of the Supreme Court of the Soviet Union on the 6th. Before this, he served as the President of the Supreme Court of the Russian Federation.

	Moscow, June 7 (Reporter: Sheng Shiliang) Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Ryzhkov, in his policy report to the Soviet People's Congress today, stated that reforming production relations is the primary policy of the new government.

	Ryzhkov was reappointed as the head of the Soviet government by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union today.

	In his report, he believed that the economic reform situation is complex, and the reform still needs to be tested in the transitional period where administrative command methods and economic leadership methods coexist. He revealed that the Soviet Union is drafting an anti-monopoly law to ensure the normal development of the market.

	He listed the four central tasks of the new government in deepening economic reform: reforming the work of the union republics and local soviets according to the principles of regional economic accounting; improving economic accounting through various forms of ownership; managing the market with modern and effective methods; formulating tax policy principles to regulate financial relations between the central government, local governments, enterprises, and residents.

	When discussing the reform of the national economic structure and the orientation of the economy towards social welfare, he revealed that 40 million people in the Soviet Union live below the poverty line. Starting next year, through measures such as increasing the minimum pension, the welfare benefits of 22 million people will be improved.

	The deterioration of the fiscal situation is the number one problem facing the Soviet economy. Ryzhkov proposed that through measures such as increasing the production of consumer goods, reducing production-based construction investment, reducing military spending, and management expenses, the deficit will be eliminated by 1995.

	He pointed out that out of this year's military expenditure of 77.3 billion rubles (approximately $12 billion), 32.6 billion is for weaponry and equipment, 15.3 billion is for military research and development, and 20.2 billion is for military salaries. By 1995, the proportion of military expenditure in national income will be reduced by one-third to one-half.

	The head of the Soviet government also revealed several figures of general concern: the annual expenditure in the Afghan War in recent years was 5 billion rubles; the cost of space exploration was 6.9 billion rubles, of which 3.9 billion was for military space exploration. He said that the new government will strive to create a legal and socially stable atmosphere domestically, reliably ensuring the strict implementation of the will of the people.

　　雷日科夫再任苏部长会议主席
    政府首要方针是改革生产关系
    新华社莫斯科６月７日电  （记者竺承军）在７日上午的苏联最高苏维埃会议上，５９岁的雷日科夫再次被任命为苏联部长会议主席。
    上述任命将在８日的苏联人民代表大会上确认。
    让雷日科夫继续担任部长会议主席的建议是由苏联最高苏维埃主席戈尔巴乔夫提出的。代表们在讨论雷日科夫的候选人资格时，向他提出了大量问题。雷日科夫在回答时说，上一届部长会议在战略和原则计划方面没有失误，但在某些方面的工作确有失误，例如，在完善基本建设和农业的经济机制方面工作做得不够。他认为，失误对发展国民经济产生了消极影响，造成了社会的紧张。
    ５００多人的表决结果是９人反对，３１人弃权。表决后，雷日科夫再次走上讲坛，感谢代表们对他的信任。他说：我了解国家现时所处的复杂状况，但我也懂得，唯有前进才能解决苏联社会所面临的问题。今后的道路不会平坦，工作不会轻松。
    在７日的苏联最高苏维埃会议上，根据戈尔巴乔夫的提议哈萨克党中央第一书记科尔宾当选为苏联人民监督委员会主席。
    ６６岁的斯莫连采夫６日被选为苏联最高法院院长，在此之前，他担任俄罗斯联邦最高法院院长。
    新华社莫斯科６月７日电　（记者盛世良）苏联部长会议主席雷日科夫今天在向苏联人代会作施政报告时，把改革生产关系称作新政府的首要工作方针。
    雷日科夫今天再次被苏联最高苏维埃任命为苏联政府首脑。
    他在报告中认为，经济改革情况复杂，改革尚需在行政命令方法和经济领导方法并存的过渡时期经受考验。他透露，苏联在制订反垄断法，以保证市场的正常发展。
    他列举了新政府在深化经济改革方面的４项中心任务：根据地区经济核算原则改革加盟共和国和地方苏维埃的工作；运用各种所有制形式改进经济核算；用现代化的有效方法管理市场；制订税收政策原则，调节中央与地方、企业、居民的金融关系。
    他在谈到国民经济结构改革和经济面向社会福利的问题时透露，苏联有４０００万人生活在贫困线以下。明年１月起，通过提高最低退休金等措施，使２２００万人的福利待遇得到改善。
    财政状况恶化是苏联经济当前的头号难题。雷日科夫提出，通过增产消费品、减少生产性基建投资、减少军费和管理经费等措施，到１９９５年消除赤字。
    他指出，在今年的７７３亿卢布（约合１２００亿美元）的军费中，３２６亿为武器装备费，１５３亿为军事科研费，２０２亿为军饷。到１９９５年，军费占国民收入的比重将下降１／３至１／２。
    苏联政府首脑还透露了几个人们普遍关心的数字：前几年在阿富汗战争中的消耗每年为５０亿卢布；宇航费用达６９亿卢布，其中３９亿为军事宇航费用。他说，新政府将努力在国内创造法制和社会安定气氛，可靠地保证严格执行人民的意志。
