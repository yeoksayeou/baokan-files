An elderly man in his 70s from Shanghai, Wu Zhouzhong, has spent 50 years and a fortune collecting and researching ancient paper currency, becoming an expert in the field of ancient coin appraisal in China.

Mr. Wu, born into poverty, started working in a textile mill as an apprentice at a young age. After three years, he opened a small factory, improving his family's financial situation. However, he lived frugally and became passionate about collecting paper currency. Over the years, he spent tens of thousands of yuan, accumulating over 15,000 pieces of paper currency from various historical periods in China, starting from the Yuan Dynasty. He is considered the most comprehensive collector of ancient paper currency in China. The earliest three pieces of paper currency known in China are from the Yuan Dynasty, and Mr. Wu owns one of them—“Zhi Yuan Bao Chao.” He also has rare items such as the Tian Di Hui cloth currency of 5 taels, the first silver certificate in China “Tai Nan Guan Yin Piao,” and economic construction bonds issued by the Chinese Soviet Republic, all of which are rare and precious.

Collecting brought Mr. Wu joy, but it also subjected him to various hardships. During the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression, he hid currency issued by the base areas in his shoe soles to avoid Japanese searches. During the Kuomintang period, he hid these items, which were suspected of being communist, under the roof tiles. During the Cultural Revolution, his family's belongings were seized, but his collection was saved because he had deposited them in a museum a few days earlier, hiding them in a cave. In 1979, after his collection was returned to him, Mr. Wu, grateful for the museum's careful preservation, donated over 5,000 pieces to the Shanghai Museum.

Mr. Wu is not only diligent in collecting but also meticulous in his research. He spent his later years studying and appraising paper currency. He has published nearly 100 academic papers on paper currency research and authored two books: “A Brief History of Guangdong Paper Currency” and “Currency of the Xinhai Revolution.” The paper currency section of “A Comprehensive History of Chinese Currency” was also written by him. In 1986, he was appointed as a member of the National Cultural Relics Appraisal Committee by the Ministry of Culture.

In 1911, a Japanese scholar published a book titled “Ancient Paper Currency of China,” which included 72 pieces of Chinese ancient paper currency. Mr. Wu compared his collection and identified 69 of them as forgeries. In the fifth volume of “A General History of China,” there is a Song Dynasty paper currency called “Hui Zi.” Mr. Wu, through detailed research on the counterfeiting process of the copper plate used to print this currency, concluded that it was also a forgery. Mr. Wu also, through his research on the origin of the term “Bao Chao” in the Yuan Dynasty, determined that the so-called “Da Tang Bao Chao” recorded in some foreign literature is also a forgery. This finding has led the academic community to reach a more consensus on the fact that Chinese paper currency began in the Song Dynasty.

　　古稀老翁爱收藏
    新华社记者  严卫民
    上海７３岁的收藏家吴筹中，积５０年心血，耗万贯家财，悉心收藏、研究古纸币，成为国内古币鉴定专家。
    吴老先生出身贫寒，从小在纱厂学徒。３年后开了一家小厂，家境稍宽裕，却省吃俭用，迷上了纸币收藏。经年历月，耗尽数万元家私，收藏了我国从元代始各个历史时期的纸币１５０００多张，成为国内古纸币收藏的集大成者。我国目前所能见到的最早的３张纸币实物，是元代的。吴老先生就藏有其中的一张——“至元宝钞”。他还藏有天地会布币５两、中国第一张银元券“台南官银票”和中华苏维埃共和国发行的经济建设公债券等，都是难得的孤品或珍品。
    收藏给吴筹中带来乐趣，但也使他尝尽了甜酸苦辣。抗战时，他将根据地发行的纸币藏在鞋底，以躲过日本鬼子的搜查；国民党时期，他把这些有“通共”嫌疑的藏品藏在屋顶瓦片下。到了文革，他家中财物被抄，但他的藏品因早几天交博物馆保存，藏在山洞里才免遭劫难。１９７９年“完璧归赵”后，吴老先生感上海博物馆妥善保管之恩，将５０００多张精品献给了该馆。
    吴老先生勤于收藏，更精于研究。他把晚年享清福的时间都用在纸币的鉴定和研究上。他发表的有关纸币研究的专论近百篇，出版了《广东纸币小史》和《辛亥革命货币》两本专著。《中国历代货币大系》的纸币部分，也是由他主笔的。１９８６年他被文化部聘为国家文物鉴定委员会委员。
    １９１１年日本学者所著的《支那国古纸币》一书，收录了中国古纸币７２张。吴老先生对照自己藏品鉴别出其中６９张是膺品。《中国通史》第五卷中收录的一张宋代纸币“会子”，吴老先生是从对印制这纸币的铜版伪造过程的详细研究，得出这也是膺品的结论。吴老先生还从对“宝钞”一词发源于元代的考证，认定中外一些著述中收录的所谓“大唐宝钞”亦系伪造。这个辨伪结果，使学术界对中国纸币始于宋代有了较为一致的定论。　　　　　　　（新华社供本报专稿）
