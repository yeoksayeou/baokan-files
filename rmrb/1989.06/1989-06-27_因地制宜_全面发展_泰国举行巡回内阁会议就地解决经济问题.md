Starting this year, the Thai government has changed its traditional approach by moving the cabinet meetings focused on developing local economies from the Prime Minister's Office to various locations around the country. This allows for on-site inspections, broad consultations with local residents, and immediate decision-making to solve problems on the ground. This measure has played an active role in promoting local economic development, balancing regional disparities, and improving people's lives.

In recent years, Thailand's economy has developed rapidly, with per capita income increasing from 18,968 baht (approximately $758.72) in 1984 to 26,412 baht (approximately $1,056.48) in 1988. However, regional development imbalances have led to significant income disparities among the population. According to a recent survey by the Thai National Economic and Social Development Board, the population of Bangkok and its surrounding areas is approximately 8 million, but their income accounts for half of the national total, equivalent to the combined income of 46 million people in other regions. The average annual income in other regions is only 12,212 baht (approximately $488.48). The regions with the lowest incomes are the Northeast, followed by the North and South.

To address the economic backwardness in these regions and improve the income and living standards of the people, the Thai government held mobile cabinet meetings in the South, Northeast, and North in the first half of this year. Before each meeting, the National Economic and Social Development Board and other government agencies submitted reports and recommendations based on their investigations. During the meetings, the Thai Prime Minister, accompanied by government officials, personally inspected the relevant regions and actively listened to the opinions and suggestions of local residents. Based on the different characteristics of each region, the government provided targeted support for economic development projects and solved practical difficulties.

The first mobile cabinet meeting was held in Hat Yai, Songkhla Province, on March 4. Based on the geographical location and resource conditions of the South, it was decided to transform the region into an export-oriented industrial zone and a free economic zone focused on agricultural processing. Specific plans were made for the construction of the region, including the development of two deep-water ports capable of docking 20-million-ton cargo ships, one in Chumphon Province near the Andaman Sea and the other in Nakhon Si Thammarat Province near the Gulf of Thailand. These ports would be connected by roads, linking the Gulf of Thailand and the Andaman Sea. Industrial zones would be established between the two ports, forming an economic corridor. Industrial products would then be exported through the ports. The meeting also proposed turning the five provinces of Songkhla, Satun, and Trang, which border Malaysia, into a free trade zone, adopting special currency and financial measures to make the region similar to Hong Kong and Singapore.

The second mobile cabinet meeting was held in Khon Kaen Province on April 8. Given the barren geology, drought, and water scarcity in the Northeast, it was decided to allocate 20 billion baht for water conservancy projects and other development initiatives. A plan was formulated to divert water from the Mekong River, build reservoirs, and benefit 13 provinces through irrigation. Additionally, measures were studied to exploit local natural gas, establish industrial zones, and expand border trade with Laos.

The mobile cabinet meeting held in Chiang Mai on May 13 focused on the North. Emphasis was placed on developing the tourism industry, protecting the natural environment and cultural heritage, and developing new tourist attractions. Efforts were also made to improve vegetable and fruit varieties, expand planting areas, establish vegetable and fruit centers, and increase exports. The development of agricultural production among ethnic minorities in the mountains was promoted to replace the cultivation and production of opium drugs. Support was also provided for the development of small-scale industries in the 17 provinces of the North.

The decisions and measures of the mobile cabinet meetings have received strong support from local governments and people. The Thai Prime Minister has set a goal to complete these plans within four to five years.

　　因地制宜　全面发展    
    ——泰国举行巡回内阁会议就地解决经济问题
    本报记者  刘爱成
    从今年开始，泰国政府一改传统做法，将发展地方经济的内阁会议从总理府转到外地巡回举行，对所要讨论的问题进行实地考察，广泛征求当地群众意见，然后当场作出决定，就地解决问题。这一措施对因地制宜，全面发展经济，改善人民生活起了积极作用。
    近年来，泰国经济发展迅速，国民人均年收入从一九八四年的一万八千九百六十八铢（约七百五十八点七二美元）增加到一九八八年的二万六千四百一十二铢（约一千零五十六点四八美元）。但地区发展的不平衡，使人民的收入悬殊很大。据泰国国家经济社会发展委员会最近发布的一项调查报告说，曼谷及其周围地区人口总数约八百万，其收入却占国民总收入的一半，相当于外地四千六百万人口收入的总和。而外地人民的平均年收入只有一万二千二百一十二铢（约四百八十八点四八美元）。其中收入最低的是东北部，再就是北部、南部等其他地区。
    泰国政府为了改变这些地区的经济落后状况，提高人民的收入和生活水平，今年上半年先后在南部、东北部和北部巡回召开了内阁会议。每次会议之前，首先由国家经社委员会及其他政府机构根据考察结果向会议提出报告和建议。会议期间，泰国总理携政府要员亲自对有关地区进行视察，并主动听取当地群众的意见和建议。根据各地区不同特点，有重点地扶助他们的经济发展项目，解决实际困难。
    三月四日在宋卡府合艾市举行的首次巡回内阁会议，根据南部地区的地理位置和资源状况，决定把南部地区变成一个以农产品加工为主的出口工业区和自由经济区，并具体规划了该地区的建设情况，即同时在靠近安达曼海一侧的甲州府和靠泰国湾一侧的洛坤府分别建设两个能停泊二十万吨货轮的深水港，并通过公路将两港连接，使泰国湾和安达曼海相连。而在两港之间陆地上建立工业区，成为一条经济走廊。然后通过港口把工业品输往外地出口。会议还根据宋卡、沙敦及陶公等五个府与马来西亚接壤的特点，主张把这五个府变成一个自由经济贸易区，并采取使用特别的货币和财政办法使这一地区成为类似香港和新加坡式的自由贸易区。
    四月八日在坤敬府召开的第二次巡回内阁会议，根据东北部地质贫瘠，干旱缺水的情况，决定拨款二百亿铢，用于水利建设及其他项目的发展。并制定了从湄公河引水、修水库，使十三个府受益的灌溉计划。同时还研究了开采当地天然气、增设工业区以及扩大与老挝的边境贸易等措施。
    五月十三日在清迈召开的巡回内阁会议，根据北部的特点，强调该地区以发展旅游业为主，保护自然环境和文化遗产，开发新的旅游点；同时改良蔬菜、水果品种，扩大种植面积，建立蔬菜水果中心，扩大出口；发展山地少数民族的农业生产，取代鸦片毒品的种植与生产，以及扶助北部十七府发展小型工业等。
    巡回内阁会议的决议和措施深受当地政府、人民的拥护和支持。泰国总理要求在四—五年内完成上述计划。
