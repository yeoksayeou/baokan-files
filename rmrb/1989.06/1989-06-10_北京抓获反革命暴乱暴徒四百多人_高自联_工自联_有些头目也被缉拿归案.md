Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 10th.

Beijing has arrested over 400 rioters involved in the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Some leaders of the "Beijing Autonomous Federation of Students" and the "Beijing Workers' Autonomous Federation" have also been apprehended. Many rioters who fled to other regions have also been captured.

Among those arrested are rioters who smashed and burned military vehicles and public buses, looted military supplies, severely beat soldiers of the martial law troops, stormed and vandalized government buildings, and engaged in other destructive activities. Guo Haifeng, a standing committee member and secretary-general of the "Beijing Autonomous Federation of Students," was captured on the spot by soldiers while preparing to burn an armored vehicle with a group of rioters.

On the night of June 3, rioter Ban Huijie saw a detachment of martial law troops marching north on Taoranting Road. He picked up a military belt from the ground and beat the soldiers, then dragged out a soldier he had injured and, together with a group of thugs, continued to beat him severely. The soldier, who suffered serious injuries with over 50 stitches on his forehead, is still in critical condition. Lu Zhongshu, a rioter who rode from Hebei to Beijing to participate in the rebellion, took oil drums from a military truck on the night of June 4 in Hongqiao and set fire to multiple military trucks and armored vehicles. On the evening of June 6, as he attempted to repeat his violent acts, he was captured by on-duty soldiers. On the night of June 6, rioter Wang Lianxi set fire to a trolley bus used as a roadblock at Xidan intersection. As he fled, laughing wildly, he was apprehended by the public and police officers.
