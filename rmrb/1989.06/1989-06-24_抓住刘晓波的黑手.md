People still remember that after martial law was declared in parts of the capital for 12 days, extensive propaganda and explanatory work gradually gained people's understanding and support. Meanwhile, the number of students sitting in at Tiananmen Square decreased day by day, making it difficult for them to continue. However, on June 2, Tiananmen Square staged another farce where four people went on a hunger strike for 48-72 hours. The initiator of this hunger strike was Liu Xiaobo, a lecturer in the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University, who rushed back from the United States at the beginning of the turmoil.

On the evening of June 1, Liu Xiaobo made a speech through a loudspeaker at the gate of Beijing Normal University. He bluntly said, "Since I returned to China, I have devoted myself to the national democratic movement led by university students. I spent several unforgettable days and nights with the university students in Tiananmen Square. Now the government repeatedly emphasizes a 'very small number of people,' the so-called 'a handful.' It seems to refer to people like me who are not students. But I want to say... I am not afraid to be called a black hand. Instead, I am proud, proud, and honored to be called a black hand!"

The words could not be clearer. Now, let us see through Liu Xiaobo's actions during and after the student movement, as well as during the turmoil and riots, how this black hand, in collusion with domestic and foreign reactionary forces, extended its reach into the capital's student movement and incited turmoil.

Liu Xiaobo has long been known as a "madman," "mad dog," and "dark horse." Since 1986, he has gained some notoriety by denying everything about China. After obtaining a Ph.D. in literature from Beijing Normal University on June 25, 1988, he went to Norway to lecture on August 24. After three months, he moved to the United States. Even before leaving the country, he wanted to throw out a batch of so-called "heavy bombs" against communism and the people. However, considering his imminent departure, he feared it might "go wrong," so he hid them temporarily. Once abroad, he had no inhibitions and threw them out one after another. In the violent explosions and shocks of these "bombs," his true face was exposed nakedly.

In October 1988, he wrote in the Hong Kong publication *Liberation Monthly*, "Marxism-Leninism in China is more of a component of authoritarian power than a belief. Marxism-Leninism is not a belief but a tool for the rulers to impose ideological dictatorship." Therefore, he has always directed his attacks at Marxism-Leninism. In the April 1989 issue of *Liberation Monthly*, he wrote, "Criticizing Marxism will directly transform into a criticism of Oriental despotism." In November 1988, while traveling from Norway to the United States via Hong Kong, he more brazenly sang the praises of colonialism in an interview with *Liberation Monthly*. When asked under what conditions China could achieve a genuine historical transformation, Liu Xiaobo shamelessly replied, "Three hundred years of colonial rule. Hong Kong, after a hundred years of colonial rule, has become what it is today. China is so large, of course, it needs three hundred years of colonial rule to become like Hong Kong today. I still have doubts about whether three hundred years are enough." Even the reporter from Hong Kong's *Liberation Monthly* could not help but say, "This is sheer treason." Liu Xiaobo replied, "I don't care about patriotism or treason. If you say I am a traitor, I will be a traitor! I will admit to being an unfilial descendant who digs up ancestral graves and take pride in it!" As a programmatic proposition, he proposed in an article published in the November 1988 issue of *Liberation Monthly* four "replacements": "Only a multi-party democratic system can replace one-party dictatorship; private ownership and market economy can replace public ownership and planned economy; pluralistic freedom of speech and thought can replace ideological uniformity; Western (modern) culture can replace traditional Chinese culture." Here, Liu Xiaobo put forward a systematic and comprehensive proposal to replace the socialist republic with a bourgeois republic.

By the end of 1988, Liu Xiaobo arrived in the United States. He immediately hit it off with the reactionary organization "China Democratic Union" (CDU), headquartered in New York, which advocates "abolishing the 'Four Upholds' in the Constitution of the People's Republic of China" and "fundamentally changing the current authoritarian system in China." They colluded, acted in concert, and constantly sought opportunities to act. Since this year, from Fang Lizhi and others' petition to save Wei Jingsheng, to the student movement incited under the banner of mourning Hu Yaobang, they have closely watched, studied diligently, and acted in coordination. As soon as the student movement in the capital was launched, Liu Xiaobo thought the time was ripe and eagerly joined the fray.

This fascist who has always claimed, "I admire Hitler the most," now appears in the guise of a "democracy fighter." In March 1989, he participated in the signing of an open letter in New York to "uphold human rights" and support Fang Lizhi and others' demand to release Wei Jingsheng. After the student movement in the capital broke out in April, the *Ming Pao* newspaper in Hong Kong published a news item on April 20, revealing that Liu Xiaobo, together with the heads of the reactionary organization CDU, Hu Ping, and the core member Chen Jun, issued a so-called "recommendation for reform," expressing concern for the current student movement on the mainland. In the "recommendation," they proposed to "re-examine" the "1983 campaign to eliminate spiritual pollution" and the "1987 campaign against bourgeois liberalization," advocating "amending the constitution" to remove the Four Cardinal Principles. On April 22, Liu Xiaobo published an article titled "Reflections on the Phenomenon of Hu Yaobang's Death" in the *World Journal*, concentrating his attacks on China's socialist system as an "autocratic regime" and inciting the student movement to "abandon the reform model of seeking an enlightened monarch and try to walk a path of institutional reform in China." How to walk this path? Liu Xiaobo openly called for collusion with foreign reactionary forces. He said, "If university students on the mainland and those intellectuals pursuing democracy can publicly support the enlightened faction within the party while also publicly supporting Wei Jingsheng and others and the overseas *Spring of China*, it will definitely accelerate China's democratization process." The *Spring of China* mentioned here is a reactionary publication run by the "China Democratic Union" nurtured by the Kuomintang in Taiwan. Obviously, Liu Xiaobo's goal was to bring the student movement into the track of internal and external collusion and further direct its attack at opposing the so-called domestic "tyranny." He incited, "Tyranny is not to be feared; what is to be feared is the submission, silence, or praise of tyranny." (See the April 1989 issue of Hong Kong's *Liberation Monthly*). We see that the student movement in the capital quickly raised the slogan of demanding a review of the campaigns to eliminate spiritual pollution and against bourgeois liberalization. The student parade carried the reactionary slogan "Down with tyranny," which was certainly not accidental.

People remember that on April 26, at a critical juncture in the Beijing student movement, a big-character poster titled "An Open Letter to Chinese University Students" was posted at the Triangle of Peking University. The letter boosted the student movement, saying that some university students' activities "have already influenced China's present and will necessarily influence China's future to an even greater extent." It gave the organizers of the student movement seven suggestions: "Strengthen the organizational connections that have already been established," "publish their own communications or other publications," "strengthen connections with other sectors of society (including workers, peasants, urban residents, and intellectuals)," "seek their support and participation," and "strive to implement freedom on campus," including "establishing various fully autonomous associations," "strengthening freedom of expression on campus (campus democracy walls, big-character posters, academic lectures with various debates)," and "be ready to take actions from posting big-character posters to parading, striking, etc." Most of these suggestions were adopted and used in the subsequent student movement and turmoil. This open letter was drafted by Liu Xiaobo on April 22 in New York and co-signed by 10 people, including the heads of the CDU, Hu Ping and Chen Jun, and published in a U.S. newspaper before being quickly transmitted back to Beijing.

Perhaps Liu Xiaobo felt that manipulating the domestic student movement from afar was not smooth enough, so he accepted the CDU's dispatch and rushed back to Beijing from New York on April 27. Originally, Liu Xiaobo wrote to the Chinese Department of Beijing Normal University, saying he was invited to lecture at Columbia University and would return to China in 1990. However, when the letter arrived at Beijing Normal University in early May, he had already arrived at Tiananmen Square. Kind-hearted people might ask if he rushed back to participate in the mourning activities for Comrade Hu Yaobang. Absolutely not. He made it clear in an article in the *World Journal*, "Upon hearing the news of Hu Yaobang's death, apart from indifference, I had no other feelings." His sudden return to China was entirely to directly intervene in the student movement.

It is known that before returning to China, Liu Xiaobo had several discussions with Hu Ping and others about the Beijing student movement. Before his departure, Chen Jun specially called Beijing's Four Communications Company to inform them of the flight Liu was taking and requested that "Four Communications" send a car to the airport to pick up Liu. He also said that if Liu was arrested at the airport (which shows his guilty conscience), the news must be promptly reported to the CDU. From this, one can clearly see how much the CDU cared about and had high hopes for Liu Xiaobo's return to China to intervene in the student movement.

According to informed sources, after returning to Beijing, Liu Xiaobo immediately contacted the heads of the "Autonomous Federation of University Students," his friend Wu'erkaixi, Wang Dan, and others, and handed over several thousand U.S. dollars and over ten thousand yuan in cash donated by him and Wang Bingzhang (the former head of the reactionary organization CDU and the leader of the newly established China Democratic Party) to the "Beijing Normal University Student Autonomous Council" as funds for the student movement. Later, Liu Xiaobo actively participated in the "Autonomous Federation of University Students" command center's propaganda, drafting, lecturing, and fundraising activities in Tiananmen Square. Apart from being responsible for the composition and editing of "Voice of the Square" and delivering multiple speeches on the situation of the student movement, he was also in charge of the illegal organization of the "Capital United Front." When some students in the square expressed their intention to withdraw from the hunger strike, Liu Xiaobo threatened, "If you leave now, you are a traitor. We have no other way out!"

During this period, Liu Xiaobo was very busy. He drafted and distributed "An Open Letter to the Party Committee of Beijing Normal University" and "A Letter to Overseas Chinese and All Foreigners Concerned with China's Affairs," continuing to confuse public opinion and do his utmost to mislead people. After martial law was partially implemented in Beijing, Liu Xiaobo intensified his criminal activities. On May 23, in the streets and alleys of Beijing and in the center of the turmoil, Tiananmen Square, a reactionary leaflet titled "Our Proposal" appeared. This leaflet was once rampant and was regarded by some as a "guiding document" for the development of the student movement. The leaflet slandered the legitimate government elected by the National People's Congress as a "fake government" and issued the call for the "fake government to resign and Li Peng to step down"; it distorted the partial martial law in Beijing as "martial law" and incited "a general mobilization of the entire society" to seek "dissolution of martial law," and urged "workers in state-owned enterprises" to establish "autonomous councils that truly represent the interests of workers"; it incited "privately-owned enterprises" to publicly demand "complete privatization of enterprises" to make "property rights clearly belong to individuals"; it also maliciously instigated the "eight democratic parties" in China to sever their cooperative relationship with the Communist Party of China, attempting to incite them to break away from the leadership of the Communist Party of China, "systematically, openly, and clearly propose independent political participation requirements to the government, and further become truly independent democratic parties with independent rights." It has been found that this revolutionary manifesto, issued in the name of the illegal organization "Beijing Normal University Student Autonomous Council," aimed at overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subverting China's socialist system, was not written by the university students but was the work of Liu Xiaobo. This shows how closely Liu Xiaobo's black hand is related to the student movement and turmoil in Beijing.

As the situation developed, more and more people saw through the essence of the turmoil. Many university students withdrew from Tiananmen Square, and a large number of students from other provinces returned to their schools. The relationship between Beijing residents and the martial law troops of the People's Liberation Army became increasingly harmonious, and the situation was developing in a positive direction. However, a small number of plotters and manipulators behind the scenes were unwilling to give up, and the hooligans and all reactionary forces in society did not want the situation to calm down.

　　抓住刘晓波的黑手
    王昭
    人们都还记得，在首都部分地区宣布戒严１２天之后，经过大量的宣传解释工作，戒严日益取得人们的理解和支持，而天安门广场静坐的学生则日渐减少，难以为继的时候，６月２日，天安门广场却又演出了一出４人绝食４８—７２小时的闹剧。这次绝食的发起人，就是北京师范大学中文系讲师、动乱之初特意从美国匆忙赶回来的刘晓波。
    ６月１日晚，刘晓波其人在北师大校门通过大喇叭做了一通演讲。他直言不讳地说：“我从回国后，就全身心地投入到了以大学生为主体的全民民主运动，我在天安门广场同大学生度过了十几个非常难忘的日日夜夜。现在政府一再强调极少数、极少数人，所谓的一小撮，它的所指看来就是指类似我这样不是学生身份的人。但我想说……我不怕当黑手，我反而以当黑手为自豪，为骄傲，为荣光！”
    话说得再明白不过了。现在，让我们通过刘晓波在这场学潮后以及动乱和暴乱中的所做所为，看看这只黑手是如何在同海内外反动势力相互勾结中，伸向首都学潮，并极力煽动动乱的。
    刘晓波向来有“狂人”、“疯狗”、“黑马”之称，１９８６年以来，他以否定中国的一切很出了些风头。１９８８年６月２５日在北京师范大学获得文学博士学位后，８月２４日去到挪威讲学。３个月期满，转到了美国。还在出国之前，他就想抛出一批反共反人民的所谓“重磅炸弹”，但是考虑到出国在即，害怕因此“泡汤”，暂时隐藏起来。到了国外，他无所顾忌了，便把它们连续地抛了出来。在这些“炸弹”剧烈的爆炸冲击震荡中，赤裸裸地暴露出了他的真实面目。
    １９８８年１０月，他在香港《解放月报》上著文宣称：“马列主义在中国，与其说是信仰，不如说是专制权力的组成部分。马列主义不是信仰，而是统治者进行思想独裁的工具。”因而，他始终把攻击的矛头指向马列主义。在１９８９年４月的《解放月报》上，他著文说：“批判马克思主义将直接转化为对东方专制主义的批判。”１９８８年１１月，他从挪威赴美、途经香港，在接受《解放月报》记者专访时，更加放肆地为殖民主义大唱赞歌。当记者问到在什么条件下中国才有可能实现一个真正的历史变革时，刘晓波恬不知耻地答道：“三百年殖民地。香港一百年殖民地变成今天这样，中国那样大，当然需要三百年殖民，才会变成今天香港这样。三百年够不够，我还有怀疑。”对此，连香港《解放月报》的记者都忍不住说：“十足的卖国主义啦。”刘晓波回答说：“我无所谓爱国、叛国，你要说我叛国，我就叛国！就承认自己是挖祖坟的不孝子孙，且以此为荣。”而作为纲领性的主张，则是刊于１９８８年１１月《解放月报》一篇署名文章中提出的四个“代替”。他说：“只能从多党并存的民主制代替一党独裁；用私有制、市场经济代替公有制、计划经济；用多元化的言论、思想的自由来代替思想一元化；用世界的（西方的）现代文化来代替中国的传统文化。”这里，刘晓波提出了以资产阶级共和国来推翻社会主义共和国的系统的全面的主张。
    １９８８年底，刘晓波到了美国。同总部设在纽约的以“取消中华人民共和国宪法中‘四个坚持’”，“从根本上改变中国现行的专制制度”为纲领的反动组织“中国民主团结联盟”（简称“中国民联”），一拍即合。他们勾结起来，沆瀣一气，不断寻找机会，伺机而动。今年以来，从方励之等人的签名上书为魏京生请命，到打着悼念胡耀邦同志旗号煽动的学潮，他们都密切注视，潜心研究，协作行动。首都学潮刚刚发动，刘晓波自以为时机成熟，便急不可耐地披挂上阵了。
    这个一向宣称“我最佩服希特勒”的法西斯信徒，现在竟以“民主斗士”的面目出现。１９８９年３月，他在纽约参加了所谓“维护人权”、支持方励之等人要求释放魏京生的公开信的签名。４月，首都学潮出现之后，香港《明报》在４月２０日发表了一则消息，披露刘晓波伙同反动组织“中国民联”的头头胡平、骨干分子陈军联名发出了所谓“改革建言”，“对大陆目前的学运表示关注”。他们在“建言”中提出，要“重新审查”“１９８３年清除精神污染运动”，和“１９８７年反资产阶级自由化运动的有关问题”，鼓吹“修改宪法”，把四项基本原则“从宪法中取消”。４月２２日，刘晓波在《世界日报》上抛出了《胡耀邦逝世现象的省思》一文，集中攻击中国社会主义制度是“专制政体”，鼓动学潮要“抛弃寻找开明君主的改革模式，而尝试着走一条从制度上改造中国的道路”。这条路怎么走呢？刘晓波公然叫嚣要同国外的反动势力相勾结。他说：“如果大陆的大学生们和那些追求民主的知识分子们，能在公开支持党内开明派的同时，也公开支援魏京生等人和海外的《中国之春》，肯定会加快中国民主化的进程。”这里所说的《中国之春》，就是受台湾国民党豢养的“中国民联”所主办的反动刊物。很显然，刘晓波的目的就是要把学潮纳入内外勾结的轨道，进而将其进攻矛头引向反对所谓国内的“暴政”上。他煽动说：“暴政并不可怕，可怕的是对暴政的屈服、沉默或赞美”。（见１９８９年４月号香港《解放月报》）我们看到，首都学潮很快提出了要求为清除精神污染和反对资产阶级自由化平反的口号，学生游行队伍中打出了“打倒暴政”的反动标语，这当然不是偶然的。
    人们记得，４月２６日，在北京学潮面临下一步怎样走的紧急当口，北京大学三角地贴出了一张题为《致中国大学生的公开信》的大字报。信中为学潮打气说，部分大学生的闹事活动，“已经影响了中国的现在，并必将在更大的程度上影响中国的未来”。并给学潮的组织者出了“巩固已经建立起来的组织联系”，“出版自己的通讯或其他出版物”，“加强与其他社会各界的联系（包括工人、农民、市民和知识分子）”，“争取他们的支持和参与”，以及“努力落实校园内的自由”，包括“建立充分自治的各种社团”，“巩固校园内的表达自由（校内民主墙、大字报、学术讲座上的各种辩论会等）”，“随时准备采取从贴大字报到游行、罢课等方式”等七条主意。这些主意的绝大部分都在其后的学潮乃至动乱中被采纳运用了。这封公开信，就是由刘晓波４月２２日在纽约起草并伙同“中国民联”头头胡平、陈军等１０人签名，在美国报纸发表后迅速传回北京的。
    也许刘晓波感到，远隔重洋操纵国内的学潮不够得心应手，于是便接受“中国民联”的派遣，于４月２７日匆忙由纽约赶回北京。本来刘晓波向北京师大中文系写信，讲他应哥伦比亚大学邀请去讲学，到１９９０年才回国。可是５月初信到北师大时，他人早已到了天安门广场了。善良的人们也许会问，他是不是匆匆赶回来参加悼念胡耀邦同志的活动呢？绝对不是的。这一点他在《世界日报》一篇文章中说得明明白白：“听到胡耀邦逝世的消息，除了淡漠，我没有其他感觉。”他的突然提前回国，完全是为了直接插手学潮。
    据悉刘晓波在回国前，曾与胡平等就北京学潮事做过多次商谈。刘在临行前，陈军特地给北京四通公司打电话告知了刘所乘坐的航班，要求“四通”派车去机场接刘。并说，倘若刘在机场被捕（可见其作贼心虚），一定要把消息及时告知“中国民联”。从这里，人们可以清楚地看出，“中国民联”对于刘晓波的回国插手学潮何等关心备至并且寄予厚望。
    另据有关人士透露，刘晓波回京后，立即与“高自联”的头头、刘的好友吾尔开希以及王丹等人接上头，并向他们和“北京师范大学学生自治会”转交了他与王炳章（原反动组织“中国民联”头头、新组建的中国民主党党魁）等人所“捐赠”的数千元美钞和万余元人民币，作为学潮活动经费。其后，刘晓波在天安门广场积极参与了“高自联”指挥部宣传、撰稿、讲演、募捐等活动。他除负责“广场之声”的组稿、编辑，多次发表对学潮形势的演讲以外，还负责非法组织“首都各界联合会”的筹建工作。当广场绝食学生中有人表示要退出绝食时，刘晓波还恶狠狠威胁说：“你现在一走就是叛徒，我们现在没有别的后路可走！”
    在这段时间里，刘晓波十分忙碌。他起草并散发了《致北师大党委的公开信》、《告海外华人以及一切关心中国问题的外国人士书》等等，继续扰乱视听，极尽蛊惑人心之能事。北京市部分地区实行戒严以后，刘晓波更加紧了他的罪恶活动。５月２３日，在北京的大街小巷，在动乱中心天安门广场，出现了一份题为《我们的建议》的反动传单。这份传单一时甚嚣尘上，被某些人奉为“指导学潮发展”的“纲领性文件”。传单把经全国人民代表大会选举产生的合法政府诬蔑为“伪政府”，发出了“伪政府必须辞职，李鹏必须下台”的叫嚣；把北京市部分地区戒严歪曲为“军管”，煽动“全社会的总动员”，以求“瓦解军管”，鼓动“国营企业的工人们”成立“真正代表工人利益的自治会”；煽惑“民办企业”要公开提出“企业的完全私有化”，以使“产权明确为私人所有”；他还肆意挑拨国内“八个民主党派”同中国共产党的多党合作关系，妄图煽动它们脱离中国共产党的领导，“有计划地公开地明确地向政府提出独立的参政要求，进一步成为真正的具有独立权利的民主党派”。现已查明，这份以非法组织“北京师范大学学生自治会”的名义抛出来的旨在推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆我国社会主义制度的反革命宣言书，根本不是师大学生写的，而是出自刘晓波的手笔。由此可见刘晓波这只黑手同北京这次学潮及动乱的关系是何等地密切。
    随着事情的发展，越来越多的人看清了动乱的实质，许多大学生从天安门广场撤退出来，大量外地学生返回本校，北京市民和解放军戒严部队的关系日益融洽，形势在向好的方面发展。但是一小撮幕后策划和操纵者不甘心就此收兵，社会上的地痞流氓和一切反动势力也不愿事态就此平息，他们反党反社会主义制度反人民之心不死，还要进行拚死的较量。在这样的形势下，刘晓波气急败坏地从后面跳到了前台。他在煽动大学生继续绝食和组织１０００至５０００社会各界知名人士绝食之举流产以后，便亲自出马纠合了四通公司的两名职工，找上一位词曲作家，大喊大叫地来到天安门广场，搞所谓４８—７２小时的有限度绝食。他们不仅用这样的实际行动来煽动一部分学生和市民在天安门广场长期闹下去，扩大事态，为这场动乱打强心针。而且借机发出了暴乱的呼喊。在６月１日的演讲中，刘晓波就别有用心地说什么：“我希望通过我们的这次行动，结束中国知识分子几千年的只动口不动手的软骨症！”要他的信徒们丢掉“软骨症”，放弃“只动口不动手”的积习。他们到底要干什么，刘晓波自己的话说得清清楚楚。在这篇演说的最后，他叫嚷：“……今天在白色恐怖下，我们之所以站起来，是重新唤起全北京市民的自信。我们有能力、有信心主宰中国！”怎样“动手”以“主宰中国”呢？据香港某报发表的、他在６月２日与“一位大陆民运领袖”的对谈中说，我们就“必须在人民之中组织武装部队”。如果善良的好心人对他们要组织反革命暴乱的阴谋还有怀疑的话，那就请听一听刘晓波这段“对谈”吧。
    历史是不以反动派的意志为转移的。刘晓波之流“主宰中国”的呼嚎，不过是一场空想。人民，只有人民，才是中国这片土地的主人。
