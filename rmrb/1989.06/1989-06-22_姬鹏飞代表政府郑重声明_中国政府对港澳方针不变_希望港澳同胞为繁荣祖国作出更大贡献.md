Ji Pengfei, on behalf of the government, solemnly declares:
China's policy towards Hong Kong and Macau remains unchanged
Hopes Hong Kong and Macau compatriots will contribute more to the prosperity of the motherland

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 22 – Ji Pengfei, Director of the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, spoke to a Central Television reporter this evening, solemnly declaring on behalf of the Chinese government: The series of policies and principles formulated by the Chinese government in accordance with the "one country, two systems" concept regarding the Hong Kong and Macao issues will not change.

The full text of Ji Pengfei's remarks is as follows:

Reporter: Director Ji Pengfei, following the recent suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, some people are concerned about whether the Chinese government will change its policies and principles regarding the Hong Kong and Macao issues. Could you comment on this?

Ji Pengfei: The recent suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing has drawn great attention from people both at home and abroad, as well as from various sectors in Hong Kong and Macao. Some people have doubts about whether the Chinese government will continue to implement its policies and principles regarding the Hong Kong and Macao issues and whether it will continue to adhere to the Sino-British and Sino-Portuguese Joint Declarations. In this regard, I solemnly declare on behalf of the Chinese government: The series of policies and principles formulated by the Chinese government in accordance with the "one country, two systems" concept regarding the Hong Kong and Macao issues will not change. The Sino-British Joint Declaration on the Hong Kong issue and the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration on the Macao issue are solemn international agreements. The Chinese government will always adhere to these two declarations and fulfill all the obligations undertaken in them. We hope that the cooperation between China and Britain, and China and Portugal on the Hong Kong and Macao issues, which has already begun, can be maintained and developed. The Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, the Sino-British Land Committee, as well as the Sino-Portuguese Joint Liaison Group and the Sino-Portuguese Land Committee, should continue their work according to the original plan. The work of soliciting opinions on the draft of the Basic Law of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region can be extended appropriately. We hope to quickly overcome difficulties and continue this work. We hope that the drafting committee, consultative committee, and all Hong Kong and Macao compatriots will, with a sense of responsibility towards Hong Kong and Macao and the country, strive to complete the historical mission of drafting the Basic Law.

The counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing was a development from student movements and turmoil. During this process, Hong Kong and Macao compatriots have expressed various views in different ways. Due to a lack of understanding or incomplete understanding of the true situation of the entire event, some misunderstandings have arisen, which is understandable. Here, I would also like to point out that some people from Hong Kong and Macao have done things in the mainland that are not permitted by the national constitution and laws, and have, in fact, played a role in exacerbating the turmoil. Whether during the transitional period or after Hong Kong and Macao return to the motherland, the mainland and Hong Kong and Macao will implement two different social and economic systems. The central government will not change the capitalist system in the Hong Kong and Macao regions and will not implement socialist policies in these regions. The Hong Kong and Macao regions should not interfere with or attempt to change the socialist system in the mainland, nor should they allow anyone to use Hong Kong and Macao as a base to overthrow the central government. People going to Hong Kong and Macao must abide by the laws of Hong Kong and Macao, and Hong Kong and Macao compatriots returning to the mainland must abide by the national constitution and laws. Engaging in activities in the mainland that oppose the leadership of the Communist Party, oppose socialism, and endanger the stability and unity of the mainland is not only prohibited by the laws of the mainland but also goes against the wishes and interests of the entire nation. The result will inevitably harm the stability and prosperity of the Hong Kong and Macao regions, which is also against the wishes and interests of the vast majority of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots.

For a long time, the vast majority of Hong Kong and Macao compatriots and patriots have cared about the modernization drive in the mainland and have made many contributions to the prosperity and strength of the motherland. We will not forget this. We sincerely hope that Hong Kong and Macao compatriots, regardless of any misunderstandings they may have had, will continue to uphold the fine tradition of loving the motherland, loving Hong Kong, and loving Macao. They should maintain close ties with the mainland, care about the mainland's reforms and opening up, implement the Sino-British and Sino-Portuguese Joint Declarations, and make greater contributions to the prosperity of the motherland and the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and Macao.

　　姬鹏飞代表政府郑重声明     
    中国政府对港澳方针不变    
    希望港澳同胞为繁荣祖国作出更大贡献
    新华社北京６月２２日电  国务院港澳办公室主任姬鹏飞今晚向中央电视台记者发表谈话，代表中国政府郑重声明：中国政府按照“一国两制”构想所制定的关于香港、澳门问题的一系列方针政策不会改变。
    姬鹏飞谈话的全文如下：
    记者：姬鹏飞主任，最近北京平息了反革命暴乱后，有些人很关心我国政府会不会改变关于香港、澳门问题的方针政策，您能否就这个问题谈点看法？
    姬鹏飞：对于最近北京平息反革命暴乱的事件，海内外和港澳各界人士非常关心。有些人对于我国政府是否会继续贯彻执行关于香港、澳门问题的方针政策，是否会继续遵守中英、中葡联合声明，产生了一些疑虑。对此，我代表中国政府郑重声明：中国政府按照“一国两制”构想所制定的关于香港、澳门问题的一系列方针政策是不会改变的。中英关于香港问题的联合声明和中葡关于澳门问题的联合声明是庄严的国际协议，中国政府将始终不渝地信守这两个声明，并履行我们在这两个声明中所承担的各项义务。我们希望中英、中葡在香港、澳门问题上早已开始的合作能够保持和发展，中英联合联络小组、中英土地委员会，以及中葡联合联络小组、中葡土地小组，应该按原定计划继续进行工作。关于香港特别行政区基本法（草案）征求意见的工作，可将时间适当延长。我们希望尽快排除困难使这项工作能够继续进行。希望香港、澳门两地的起草委员、咨询委员和全体港澳同胞本着对香港、澳门负责，对国家负责的精神，为完成起草基本法这一历史使命而努力。
    北京发生的反革命暴乱是由学潮、动乱逐步发展起来的，在这过程中，港澳同胞以不同的方式表达过各种各样的看法。由于不了解或不完全了解整个事件的真实情况，产生了某些误会，是可以理解的。在这里，我也要指出，港澳某些人到内地做了一些国家宪法和法律不允许的事，在实际上对内地的动乱起了推波助澜的作用。无论在过渡时期或在港澳回归祖国之后，内地与港澳实行的是两种不同的社会、经济制度，中央人民政府决不会改变港澳地区的资本主义制度，不会把社会主义的政策推行到港澳地区，港澳地区也不应该干预或企图改变内地的社会主义制度，更不能允许有人利用港澳作为颠覆中央人民政府的基地；内地的人去港澳必须遵守港澳的法律，港澳同胞回到内地也必须遵守国家的宪法和法律。到内地从事反对共产党领导、反对社会主义和危害内地安定团结的活动，不仅是内地法律所不容许，违背全国人民的愿望和利益，结果也必将损害港澳地区的稳定繁荣，也是违背广大港澳同胞的愿望和利益的。
    长期以来，广大港澳同胞和爱国人士，关心内地的四化建设，为祖国的繁荣富强作出了很多贡献，我们是不会忘记的。我们衷心希望港澳同胞，不管有过什么样的误解，都能继续发扬爱祖国、爱香港、爱澳门的优良传统，密切同内地的交往，关心内地的开放改革，贯彻执行中英、中葡联合声明，为祖国的繁荣昌盛，为港澳的稳定繁荣而作出更大的贡献。
