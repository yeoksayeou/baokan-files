Polish Prime Minister Rakowski reiterated on June 15 that Poland's chosen path to political democracy is correct, and that regardless of the situation, the country will continue to implement policies of understanding and reform.

Rakowski made these remarks during a meeting with party activists in the southwestern Polish city of Wroclaw. He said that the Polish United Workers' Party's defeat in the first round of parliamentary and senate elections was not due to excessive reform, but rather because reforms were introduced too late and lacked sufficient resolve.

In discussing the reasons for the election defeat, Rakowski said that the ruling coalition participated in the elections under unfavorable conditions, carrying a heavy burden that included decades of policy mistakes and recent economic difficulties.

He stated that the Polish United Workers' Party will soon convene its 13th Central Committee Plenum to analyze the causes of the election defeat. He pointed out that the situation has become more complex and difficult after the first round of elections. He emphasized that the party must bravely face this new situation, remain calm and rational, and not lose heart. He expressed the hope that the future new government will be a coalition government including all forces in the parliament. He said that adhering to and implementing the decisions of the Round Table Conference is the primary condition for ensuring the smooth and stable development of the country.

　　波兰总理重申
    坚持谅解和改革政策
    新华社华沙６月１５日电  波兰总理拉科夫斯基１５日重申，波兰选择的通向政治民主的道路是正确的，不管出现什么形势，今后仍将坚持执行谅解和改革政策。
    拉科夫斯基是在波兰西南重镇弗罗茨瓦夫会见党的积极分子时作上述表示的。他说，波党在最近的议会和参议院的第一轮选举中失利，但失利并不是因为改革搞过头了，而相反，是改革搞晚了，而且缺乏足够的坚定性。
    在谈到大选失利的原因时，拉科夫斯基说，执政联盟派是在不利的条件下参加大选的，身上背着沉重的包袱，包袱中既有几十年的政策失误，也有近几年的经济困难。
    他说，不久之后波党将召开１３中全会，分析这次大选失利的原因。他指出，第一轮大选后，形势更加复杂和更加困难了。他强调，党必须勇敢地面对这一新的形势，要保持冷静和理智，不能灰心丧气。他表示希望未来的新政府是一个包括议会中所有力量的联合政府。他说，坚持和执行圆桌会议决议是确保国家顺利和安定发展的首要条件。
