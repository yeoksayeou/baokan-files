The book "Deng Xiaoping's Statements on Upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and Opposing Bourgeois Liberalization," edited by the CPC Central Committee's Literature Research Office, will soon be published by the Central Literature Publishing House and will be available in bookstores across the country.

Currently, the entire Party, the entire military, and people of all ethnic groups across the country are studying Deng Xiaoping's important speech given during his reception of senior military officers from the capital's martial law troops. To facilitate this study, the Literature Research Office has compiled Deng Xiaoping's statements over the past decade on upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization into a single volume. This will help everyone connect with past history and deeply understand Deng Xiaoping's consistent thoughts on this fundamental issue.

The book includes 39 statements made by Deng Xiaoping from the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee in 1979 to March 1989. The last four statements are being published for the first time.
