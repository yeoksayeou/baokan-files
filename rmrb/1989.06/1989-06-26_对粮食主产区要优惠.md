The more grain a county, township, or village produces, the lower the income of the farmers, and major grain-producing counties are often financially poor. This abnormal phenomenon affects the development of agriculture. To solve this problem, we must narrow the income gap between grain farmers and those engaged in other industries. We need to further adjust policies and implement favorable measures for major grain-producing areas:

(1) **Prioritize Funding Allocation**: National agricultural investments should break away from the egalitarian distribution method and prioritize major grain-producing areas. We should plan and implement key agricultural projects in these areas, such as drying and irrigation infrastructure, to accelerate the improvement of agricultural production conditions.

(2) **Prioritize Scientific and Technological Projects**: National key projects like the "Star Spark" and "Harvest" programs should be prioritized in major grain-producing areas. Other scientific research achievements should also be promoted first in these areas, especially in major grain-producing counties, townships, and households. By popularizing advanced technologies, we can increase output, reduce costs, and enhance the comparative benefits of grain production.

(3) **Prioritize Material Supply**: For scarce materials like fertilizers, diesel, agricultural films, and pesticides, we should prioritize the supply to major grain-producing counties, townships, and households.

(4) **Provide Relief and Support for Disaster- and Poverty-Stricken Grain-Producing Areas**: In addition to reducing, exempting, or deferring agricultural taxes, the state should appropriately increase disaster relief funds and poverty alleviation revolving funds to support recovery and development.

(5) **Reform the Current Grain Incentive Policy**: Implement a policy where commercial grain and bonuses are linked, truly reflecting the principle of "more contribution, more reward," and stimulating the enthusiasm of local governments and the masses to sell grain to the state.

　　对粮食主产区要优惠
    李红锋
    产粮越多的县、乡、村，农民的收入反而越低，粮食大县往往又是财政穷县。这种反常现象，影响农业的发展。为了解决这个问题，必须缩小粮农和从事其他产业的农民之间的收益差距，要进一步调整政策，对粮食主产区实行优惠：（一）资金优先投入。国家的农业投资，应打破平均主义的分配办法，优先投放于粮食主产区。有计划有步骤地在粮食主产区摆放农业重点工程建设项目，如烘干、排灌等基础设施，以加快改善这些地区的农业生产条件。（二）科技项目优先安排。国家重点实施的“星火计划”、“丰收计划”项目，要优先往粮食主产区安排，其他科研成果也要优先在粮区推广，特别是产粮大县、大乡、大户更要先行一步。通过普及先进技术增加产出，降低成本，提高粮食生产的比较利益。（三）物资优先供给。对化肥、柴油、农膜、农药等紧缺物资，要优先保证产粮大县、大乡和种粮大户。（四）对种粮灾区和贫困区，国家除对农业税收减、免、缓以外，要适当增加救灾款和扶贫周转金，以资其休养生息。（五）改变目前的粮食奖励政策。实行商品粮和奖金挂钩，真正体现多贡献多得，刺激地方和群众向国家卖粮的积极性。
