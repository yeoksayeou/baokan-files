These injured soldiers were either struck by bricks, stones, and clubs wielded by rioters on the night of June 3 and June 4, or were shot by criminals who had seized firearms.

Hong Xuezhi told the injured soldiers, "Chairman Deng and Vice Chairman Yang are very concerned about you all. They have sent us to visit you. You have, through your actions to suppress the counter-revolutionary riots in the capital, protected the Central Committee of the Party, protected the capital, and protected the People's Republic. Your injuries are glorious, and the Party and the people will never forget your merits. He encouraged everyone to rest and recover, wishing everyone a speedy recovery.

The injured soldiers expressed their gratitude for the care of the military commission leaders and vowed to recover quickly and resume their duties in enforcing martial law as assigned by the government.
