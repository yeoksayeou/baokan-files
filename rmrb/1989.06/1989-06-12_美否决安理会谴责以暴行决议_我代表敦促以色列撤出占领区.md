The U.S. Vetoes UN Security Council Resolution Condemning Israeli Atrocities

The U.S. representative to the United Nations, Thomas Pickering, vetoed a resolution condemning Israeli atrocities in the occupied territories. The resolution was not adopted.

The vote took place in the Security Council today. Fourteen other members of the Security Council voted in favor of the resolution.

The Security Council held an emergency meeting on June 6th at the request of the Arab states to discuss the situation in the Israeli-occupied territories. Recently, Israeli occupying authorities and military forces have intensified attacks on Palestinian civilians in cities and villages, expelled Palestinians from their homes, and closed some schools attended by Palestinian children for an extended period.

The resolution calls on the Israeli occupying authorities to fully respect the Geneva Conventions on the Protection of Civilians in Time of War.

In his speech, U.S. representative Thomas Pickering defended his veto by arguing that the resolution only condemned Israeli policies and actions without mentioning Palestinian violence, which he described as "unbalanced."

Palestinian observer Zohdi Terzi then spoke, refuting the U.S. representative's claim of "unbalance."

Chinese Representative Urges Israel to Withdraw from Occupied Territories

Chinese Deputy Permanent Representative to the United Nations, Yu Mengjia, today urged Israel to withdraw from the Palestinian and other Arab territories it has occupied since 1967, allowing the Palestinian people to exercise their right to self-determination.

Yu Mengjia pointed out that this is the fundamental way to ease the situation in the occupied territories and protect Palestinian civilians. He added that on this basis, all Middle Eastern countries have the right to security and survival.

　　美否决安理会谴责以暴行决议
    我代表敦促以色列撤出占领区
    本报联合国６月９日电  记者刘开宸报道：联合国安理会今天投票表决关于谴责以色列在占领区内镇压巴勒斯坦平民暴行的决议，由于美国否决，未获通过。
    决议表决时，安理会的其他１４个理事会的代表都投了赞成票。
    安理会应阿拉伯国家集团的要求，６日开始举行紧急会议，讨论以色列占领区的形势问题。以色列占领当局和军队近来在城镇和乡村加紧袭击巴勒斯坦平民，驱逐巴勒斯坦平民出境，还长期关闭巴勒斯坦儿童就读的一些学校。
    决议呼吁以色列占领当局充分遵重《关于战时保护平民的日内瓦公约》。
    美国代表托马斯·皮克林在发言中为他投反对票辩解说，该决议只谴责以色列的政策和做法，而未提巴勒斯坦人的暴力行动是“不平衡的”。
    巴勒斯坦观察员佐赫迪·泰尔齐接着发言，驳斥了美国代表的“不平衡”说法。
    本报联合国６月９日电　记者刘开宸报道：中国常驻联合国副代表俞孟嘉大使今天在联合国安理会会议上敦促以色列撤出１９６７年以来占领的巴勒斯坦和其它阿拉伯领土，让巴勒斯坦人民行使自决权。
    俞孟嘉指出，这是缓和被占领土局势，保护巴勒斯坦平民的根本出路。他接着说，在这一基础上，中东各国享有安全和生存的权利。
