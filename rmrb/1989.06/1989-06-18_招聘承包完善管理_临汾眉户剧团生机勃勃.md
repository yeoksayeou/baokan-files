The Meihu Theater Troupe in Linfen, Shanxi Province, which was the first to recruit a troupe leader and implement a contract-based management system, has, under the leadership of the elected troupe leader, Cui Fengming, focused on improving the troupe's internal management mechanisms. In the areas of auxiliary income, institutional improvement, talent cultivation, and new play creation, the troupe has made significant strides in four years, transforming from a troupe on the brink of dissolution into a vibrant and excellent troupe. The troupe's appearance has undergone a significant change.

— From relying solely on state subsidies to opening up multiple funding channels and developing various auxiliary businesses to support the arts. The troupe designated 17 full-time staff members to engage in the tertiary industry. Lacking funds, they relied on bank loans and personal investments to solve the problem; lacking experience, they learned as they went. After more than three years of effort, they fundamentally changed the situation of "begging for a living." Now, the annual income from the tertiary industry, performances, and special artistic awards reaches over 200,000 yuan. In terms of fund usage, they prioritize artistic investment. Over the past three years, they have invested nearly 200,000 yuan in equipment updates and the rehearsal of modern plays. The total value of the troupe's fixed assets has increased by 22%, and by this year, the total salary of the performing staff has doubled.

— From relying solely on random, experiential management to institutionalized, scientific management. The troupe committee and party branch mobilized the masses to formulate a series of systems and regulations from the bottom up, including management, medical fee usage, and property management. To ensure the implementation of the regulations, they also improved the supervisory institutions to ensure mutual restraint, achieving strict enforcement and clear rewards and punishments.

— From talent loss to opening up career paths, cultivating and boldly using talents, and paying attention to improving the quality of performing staff. Over the past three years, they have recruited 10 talents from outside the troupe who have expertise in the arts and management. At the same time, they focus on improving the quality of all performing staff in the troupe, especially the cultivation of young actors. They have sent more than 10 people to study at Northwest University, the Central Conservatory of Music, and other institutions, and more than 30 people have participated in on-the-job training across the country. The troupe has also established horizontal connections with many troupes across the country, broadening their horizons and learning from the best. Since 1986, 8 actors in the troupe have won gold and silver medals in provincial performances and competitions, and the troupe has received 13 awards for comprehensive management and spiritual civilization. Currently, the average age of the performing staff in the troupe is 24, and many young actors have distinctive performances. The troupe has become one of the most influential youth troupes in the province.

— From the troupe's poverty and neglect of artistic quality to producing new plays every year, each with its audience. A few years ago, the audience evaluated them: "The Meihu Theater Troupe has difficulty producing plays. 'Zhang Lian Sells Cloth' is never-ending, every performance is 'Three Scholars,' and 'Li Yaxian' is repetitive." Since the reform and contract-based management, they have not only improved the existing repertoire but also created and performed modern plays such as "Twilight Love," "In Front of Right and Wrong," and "Two Women and One Man," as well as classical plays like "Borrowing a Silk Hat" and "Linniang." They have also adapted and revised nearly 10 plays, such as "Qingfengting" and "Linniang," which have been well-received by the audience. Four of these plays have been adapted into television series, and the singing segments have been recorded and released on CDs and tapes. "Two Women and One Man" is adapted from the novel "Old Well" and is innovative in both its thematic depth and operatic artistry, receiving praise from some experts in the opera community. The Chinese Opera Modern Play Research Association has invited the troupe to perform in Beijing this year.

　　招聘承包完善管理
    临汾眉户剧团生机勃勃
    本报讯  最早招聘团长、实行合同承包经营责任制的山西省临汾地区眉户剧团，在中标团长崔凤鸣带领下，注重完善剧团内部经营管理机制，在以副补艺、健全管理制度、培养优秀人才和创编新剧目方面，４年迈出４大步，从原来面临解体的困境，一跃成为生机勃勃的优秀剧团。剧团面貌大变。
    ——变单靠伸手向国家要钱养人为开拓多种经费来源渠道，发展多种经营以副补艺。该团确定１７名专职人员从事第三产业。没有资金，靠银行贷款和个人集资解决；没有经验，边干边学。经过３年多的努力，根本上改变了“讨饭吃”的状况。现在每年第三产业、演出以及得到的专项艺术奖励收入达２０多万元。在经费使用上，首先保证艺术投资，３年多来已投入设备更新和排演现代戏近２０万元，剧团固定资产总值增加了２２％，到今年演职员的工资总额翻了一番。
    ——变单靠随意性的经验型管理为制度化的科学管理。团委会和党支部发动群众，自下而上地制定了管理、医疗费使用、财产管理等一系列制度和规定。为了保证规章的实施，还完善了互相制约的监督机构，做到令行禁止，赏罚分明。
    ——变人才流失为广开才路、培育人才大胆使用，并注意提高演职员素质。３年多来从团外招聘了１０名在艺术上、管理上有专长的人才。同时注重全团演职员素质的提高，特别是青年演员的培养。他们先后派１０多人到西北大学、中央音乐学院等院校学习深造，并有３０多人次参加全国各地观摩学习。剧团还同全国一些剧团建立起横向联系，开阔视野，广采博取。１９８６年以来，全团有８名演员获省级汇演、比赛的金牌、银牌奖，剧团获得综合治理、精神文明等１３项奖励。目前全团演职员平均年龄２４岁，不少年轻演员的表演很有特色。剧团成为全省有影响的青年剧团之一。
    ——变剧团贫乏、忽视艺术质量为年年出新戏，戏戏有观众。几年前观众评价他们：“眉户剧团出戏难，《张连卖布》唱不完，台台不离《三进士》，过来过去《李亚仙》”。自从改革承包后，他们不仅对原有剧目进行加工提高，还创作演出了现代戏《黄昏恋》、《在是非前面》、《两个女人和一个男人》，古装戏《借纱帽》，移植改编了《清风亭》、《林娘》等近１０个剧目，受到观众喜爱。其中４个剧目被电视台拍成电视片，同时将唱段灌成唱片、磁带出版发行。《两个女人和一个男人》是根据小说《老井》改编，无论在思想意蕴的开掘和戏曲艺术表现上都有新意，受到戏曲界一些专家的好评。中国戏曲现代戏研究会已邀请该团今年内赴京演出。
