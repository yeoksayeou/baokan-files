Ovcharov calls on people to maintain national stability and unity

	NEW DELHI, June 16 (Xinhua) -- A member of the Politburo of the Bulgarian Communist Party and Minister of Economy and Planning, Ovcharov, stressed on June 16 that Bulgaria, like any other sovereign state, will not allow any actions that threaten social stability and national security. It will not permit any violation of the constitution and laws, nor will it allow any actions that undermine national unity and solidarity.

	Ovcharov made these remarks at a grand memorial meeting held jointly by the Central Committee of the Bulgarian Communist Party and various social organizations to commemorate the 107th anniversary of the birth of Dimitrov.

	He called on the people of the entire country to draw strength from Dimitrov's theories and thoughts, to launch a patriotic upsurge, to safeguard national unity, and to resolutely oppose any attempts by anyone to exploit Bulgaria's new decisions aimed at enhancing international trust and understanding for personal gain.

	Ovcharov emphasized that Bulgaria is mobilizing the strength of all its people to carry out a revolutionary transformation of the entire society. Therefore, it is necessary to have rigorous organizational work, discipline, and selfless dedication. He said that the Bulgarian people are building their peaceful lives, and no force can divert them from the path they have chosen.

    他号召全国人民从季米特洛夫的理论和思想中吸取力量，掀起爱国主义的高潮，维护民族统一，坚决反对任何人利用保加利亚采取增进国际信任和谅解的新决定进行投机。
    奥弗恰罗夫强调说，保加利亚正在动员全体人民的力量，努力完成对全社会进行革命性改革的任务。因此，需要是严谨的组织工作、纪律和忘我的献身精神。他说，保加利亚人民正在建设自己的和平生活，没有任何力量能够使它偏离已经确定的道路。
