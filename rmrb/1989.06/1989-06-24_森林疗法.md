In the United States, Japan, the Soviet Union, and other countries, many places have established "forest hospitals" to promote a unique disease treatment method called "forest therapy." This treatment method only requires patients to take regular walks, rest, and admire the greenery along specific routes in designated forests, or to smell the fragrance of flowers and trees.

This "forest therapy" utilizes the aromatic compounds released by trees to kill bacteria. After inhaling these compounds, they can kill bacteria responsible for diseases such as whooping cough, diphtheria, dysentery, and tuberculosis. Additionally, it can achieve effects such as anti-inflammation, cough suppression, phlegm removal, and nerve stimulation. Medical scientists also believe that dense forests continuously release negatively charged ions into the atmosphere. These ions can promote human metabolism, lower blood pressure, regulate breathing, and enhance the body's resistance to disease.

Scientists have observed that different tree species have varying effects on the treatment of different diseases. For example, fir trees have a strong killing effect on staphylococci and whooping cough bacteria, beech trees on tuberculosis bacteria and typhoid bacteria, and eucalyptus trees on influenza viruses. Therefore, specific therapies are categorized into fir tree therapy, beech tree therapy, eucalyptus tree therapy, and so on. "Forest therapy" has no side effects and is pollution-free, making it very popular.

　　森林疗法
    杨建国
    在美国、日本、苏联和其他国家，不少地方都建起了“森林医院”，推行一种特殊的疾病疗法——“森林疗法”。这种治疗方法只要求病人定时、定路线在特定的森林中漫步、休憩、观赏绿树或用鼻子嗅花木的气味。
    这种“森林疗法”是利用树木施放出来的含有芳香气味的化合物质杀灭病菌。吸入这类化合物质后，可杀死体内的百日咳、白喉、痢疾、结核等病的病菌。同时还可收到消炎、止咳、祛痰和兴奋神经的效果。医学科学家还认为，浓密的森林，每时每刻都在向大气散发带负电的阴离子，它能促进人体的新陈代谢、降低血压、均匀呼吸、提高人体的抗病力。
    科学家通过观察发现不同的树种对不同的疾病治疗作用明显不同。比如，枞树对葡萄球菌、百日咳杆菌，槲树对结核杆菌、肠伤寒菌，桉树对流感病毒有较强的杀灭作用。因此具体又分为枞树疗法、槲树疗法、桉树疗法等。“森林疗法”无副作用、无污染，很受欢迎。
