The spokesperson of the Martial Law Command stated: Starting from yesterday, the situation in Beijing has taken a sharp turn for the worse. The disturbances created by a small number of people over the past month have developed into a counter-revolutionary rebellion. With the cooperation of Beijing workers and citizens, the martial law troops have taken decisive measures to suppress this rebellion. At around 5 AM this morning, the martial law troops entered Tiananmen Square, and the students and other people on the square simultaneously withdrew.

In the early hours of yesterday, part of the People's Liberation Army martial law troops entered the city to guard key targets. Under the incitement of a small number of people, some who were unaware of the truth set up roadblocks in various places, temporarily obstructing part of the troops entering the city. The rioters openly attacked, beat, and kidnapped PLA soldiers and officers. At Six Departments Intersection, a group of rioters intercepted a PLA truck carrying weapons and equipment and attempted to seize the weapons and ammunition. To prevent the weapons and ammunition from falling into the hands of the rioters, at 2 PM, Beijing Public Security Bureau officers and the People's Armed Police, with the cooperation of some students, dispersed the rioters and seized the truck and weapons. Subsequently, the rioters gathered more people to attack or blockade Zhongnanhai's New China Gate and West Gate, as well as the Great Hall of the People. Some rioters broke into a construction site and stole a large quantity of steel bars and bricks to prepare for a larger rebellion. As night fell, they went around inciting those who were unaware of the truth to blockade the martial law troops entering the city from various directions. The rioters used bricks, stones, and weapons to injure hundreds of PLA soldiers, armed police, public security officers, and citizens maintaining order. At the entrance of the Nationalities Culture Palace, a soldier was beaten to death by the rioters, and another soldier was beaten to death on Chongwenmen Overpass. One soldier was mutilated by the rioters, and his body was hung on the railing of Fuchengmen Overpass. The workers and citizens' patrol teams in Chongwen District were attacked by a group of rioters who rushed out from near the Front Gate Restaurant while rescuing an injured soldier. A medical vehicle from the First Detachment of the Armed Police, carrying eight injured soldiers to the People's Hospital, was stopped by a group of rioters, and one soldier was beaten to death on the spot. The rioters shouted that they would beat the remaining seven soldiers to death one by one. Four injured soldiers, after being treated at the hospital, were intercepted by a group of rioters in Dongdan while being transported in an ambulance, and two soldiers were kidnapped and their whereabouts are still unknown. In front of a bicycle shop in Qianmen, three PLA soldiers were injured, and the rioters shouted, "Anyone who dares to save them will be beaten to death!" On Fuyou Street, rioters stopped a Beijing Jeep, and a PLA officer in the car was stripped naked and humiliated by the rioters. Near Cuifu Road, a military vehicle was burned by the rioters, injuring more than ten soldiers, and a fire command vehicle was also destroyed. Another group of rioters looted a store in Xidan, taking everything they could and beating anyone they saw. The armed police sent to disperse the rioters had dozens injured. A group of rioters even jumped over the railing and rushed into the courtyard of the Broadcasting Film and Television Department, burning one car and destroying seven cars. Preliminary statistics show that the rioters burned and destroyed 31 military vehicles, 23 police vehicles, 2 armored vehicles, and 31 public buses last night, seriously threatening the lives and property of the people.

On Tiananmen Square, the illegal organizations "High Autonomy Federation" and "Workers' Autonomy Federation" distributed knives, daggers, chains, and other weapons to some people on the square and, through their loudspeakers, openly incited people to "take up arms to overthrow the government." Some people continued to deliver inflammatory and reactionary speeches. Their arrogance was extremely rampant.

In this situation, to restore the work, production, and living order of the great motherland's capital, to protect the lives and property of the broad masses of the people, the martial law troops were ordered to enter the city from all directions in the suburbs overnight and take coercive measures to suppress the rebellion. Conflicts occurred in some areas.

At 1:30 AM today, the Beijing Municipal Government and the Martial Law Command issued an emergency notice: "A serious counter-revolutionary rebellion occurred in the capital tonight. The rioters brazenly attacked PLA soldiers, seized military weapons, burned military vehicles, set up roadblocks, kidnapped PLA officers and soldiers, and attempted to overthrow the People's Republic of China and overthrow the socialist system. The People's Liberation Army has maintained high restraint for many days, but now it must resolutely counterattack the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Citizens of the capital should abide by the martial law regulations and closely cooperate with the PLA to resolutely defend the constitution, safeguard the great socialist motherland and the capital's security. All citizens and students on Tiananmen Square should leave immediately to ensure the martial law troops can carry out their duties. Those who do not heed the advice will not be guaranteed safety, and all consequences will be their own responsibility." After repeatedly broadcasting the emergency notice, large crowds of onlookers quickly left. However, some people still remained in the south end of the square near the Monument to the People's Heroes.

At 4:30 AM, the square broadcasted the notice from the Martial Law Command: "The clearing operation will begin now, and the call for students to withdraw from the square is agreed upon." Subsequently, the broadcasted the notice from the Beijing Municipal Government and the Martial Law Command on quickly restoring the normal order of Tiananmen Square. The notice said: "Tiananmen Square is the center of our great motherland's capital, Beijing, an important venue for our country's political gatherings and welcoming activities, and a symbol of New China. However, Tiananmen Square has now become a market for a small number of people to create disturbances and spread rumors. To quickly restore the normal order of Tiananmen Square, according to the wishes of the capital and the country's people and the first order of the Beijing Municipal Government on implementing martial law in some areas of Beijing, it is decided to immediately clear Tiananmen Square.

"1. All personnel on the square must leave the scene immediately upon hearing the broadcast.

"2. If anyone disobeys and refuses to comply with this notice, continues to stay on the square, the martial law troops have the right to take all necessary measures to forcibly deal with them.

"3. After the clearing, Tiananmen Square will be strictly managed by the martial law troops.

"4. It is hoped that all students and masses who love the country and do not want national turmoil will actively cooperate with the martial law troops to complete the clearing task."

At around 5 AM, the students on the square began to withdraw, and the martial law troops simultaneously entered Tiananmen Square. By 5:30 AM, the entire process ended.

From 3 AM to 4 AM, the rioters' various atrocities were only part of this counter-revolutionary rebellion. However, from this, it can be seen how rampant, cruel, and tyrannical they are! They have exposed their so-called "patriotic spirit," so-called "promotion of democracy," so-called "love of freedom," so-called "protection of human rights," so-called "peaceful petition," and all other disguises with their own evil facts, completely tearing them off and exposing their ugly faces and reactionary nature. The broad masses of students and the people have fully seen through their ugly faces and reactionary nature.

Facing the rioters' mad attacks and destruction, the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army martial law troops, armed police, and public security officers have strictly observed discipline, united as one, stood firm, and to defend the peace of the capital and the dignity of the motherland, to defend the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system, to defend the fruits of revolution, construction, and reform, and to defend the lives and fundamental interests of the broad masses of workers, peasants, intellectuals, and other social citizens, they have displayed a spirit of fearlessness of fatigue and bloodshed, and are now victoriously crushing this counter-revolutionary rebellion! Their heroic deeds and glorious achievements have received the enthusiastic praise and strong support of the broad masses of students and citizens, and they are indeed the people's children under the leadership of the Party, indeed the strong pillars and iron walls of our socialist republic.

    戒严部队平息反革命暴乱进驻天安门广场
    新华社北京６月４日电  戒严部队指挥部发言人称：从昨天开始，北京的事态急转直下，近一个多月来极少数人制造的动乱，已发展成为一场反革命暴乱。戒严部队在首都工人和市民的配合下，采取坚决措施平息这场暴乱。今晨五时左右，戒严部队进驻天安门广场，广场上的学生和其他人同时撤走。
    昨天凌晨，部分解放军戒严部队奉命入城进驻一些重点保卫目标。在极少数人煽动下，一些不明真相的人在各处设置路障，使一部分入城部队暂时受阻。暴徒们公然袭击、殴打、绑架解放军指战员。在六部口，一伙暴徒拦截了一辆解放军运送武器装备的汽车，并企图抢劫武器弹药。为了保护武器弹药不致落入暴徒之手，下午二时，北京市公安干警、武警在部分学生的配合下，驱散了暴徒，夺回了这辆汽车和武器装备。随后暴徒们又纠集一些人冲击或围堵中南海新华门和西门以及人民大会堂。一些暴徒闯入一处工地，抢走大量钢筋和砖石，准备制造更大的暴乱。入夜，他们四出煽动不明真相的人围堵各路入城的戒严部队。暴徒们用砖头、石块和凶器打伤数百名解放军指战员、武警战士、公安干警和维护秩序的群众。在民族文化宫门口的一名战士和建国门桥上一名战士被暴徒们活活打死。一名战士被暴徒残害后，尸体被挂在阜成门立交桥的栏杆上。崇文区的工人和群众纠察队，在营救被打伤的战士时，遭到从前门饭店附近窜出的一群暴徒的袭击。武警１支队１辆救护车拉了８名受伤的战士送往人民医院门口时，被一伙暴徒拦住，当场就打死一位战士，暴徒还叫嚷要把其余７名战士一个个打死。有４名受伤的战士在医院急救后，乘救护车在东单被一伙暴徒拦截，其中２名战士被绑架至今下落不明。在前门一家自行车行门前，有３名解放军战士被打伤，暴徒们竟叫嚷：“谁敢救他们就打死谁！”在府右街，暴徒们拦住一辆北京吉普，车上的一名解放军军官被暴徒们剥光衣服肆意侮辱。在翠薇路附近，一辆军车被暴徒们烧毁，十几名战士被烧伤，一辆消防指挥车也被砸毁。还有一伙暴徒哄抢西单的一个商店，见东西就抢，见人就打，前往驱散暴徒的武警战士有几十人被打伤。一群暴徒甚至越过栏杆，冲进广播电影电视部院内，烧毁汽车１辆，砸毁汽车７辆。据初步统计，暴徒们昨晚共烧毁、砸毁军车３１辆、警车２３辆、装甲车２辆、公共电汽车３１辆，人民的生命财产受到严重的威胁。
    在天安门广场上，非法组织“高自联”和“工自联”向广场上一些人发了菜刀、匕首、铁链等凶器，并通过他们架设的喇叭，公然鼓噪人们“拿起武器推翻政府”。还有人继续发表煽动性反动演说。气焰十分嚣张。
    在这种情况下，为了恢复伟大祖国首都的工作、生产、生活秩序，保卫广大人民群众的生命财产安全，戒严部队奉命连夜从四面八方的郊区入城，采取强制措施平息暴乱。在有些地段发生了冲突。
    今天凌晨一时半，北京市人民政府和戒严部队指挥部发出紧急通告：“首都今晚发生了严重的反革命暴乱。暴徒们猖狂袭击解放军指战员，抢军火，烧军车，设路障，绑架解放军官兵，妄图颠覆中华人民共和国，推翻社会主义制度。人民解放军多日来保持了高度克制，现在必须坚决反击反革命暴乱。首都公民要遵守戒严令规定，并同解放军密切配合，坚决捍卫宪法，保卫伟大的社会主义祖国和首都的安全。凡在天安门广场的公民和学生，应立即离开，以保证戒严部队执行任务。凡不听劝告的，将无法保证其安全，一切后果完全由自己负责。”广场上反复播放紧急通告后，大批围观群众迅速离开。但仍有一部分人盘据在广场南端人民英雄纪念碑一带。
    凌晨４时半，广场上广播了戒严部队指挥部的通知：现在开始清场，同意同学们撤离广场的呼吁。随后，广播了北京市人民政府和戒严部队指挥部关于迅速恢复天安门广场正常秩序的通告。通告说：“天安门广场是我们伟大祖国首都北京的中心，是我国举行政治性集会和迎宾活动的重要场所，是新中国的象征。但是，现在天安门广场已经成了极少数人制造动乱、传播谣言的市场。为了尽快恢复天安门广场的正常秩序，根据首都和全国人民的共同愿望和北京市人民政府关于在北京市部分地区实行戒严的第一号令，决定立即对天安门广场执行清场。
    “一、凡在广场上的所有人员，听到广播必须立即撤离现场。
    “二、如果有人违抗和拒不执行此通告，仍继续滞留广场，戒严部队有权采取一切手段予以强行处置。
    “三、清场后，天安门广场由戒严部队严格管理。
    “四、希望一切有爱国之心，不愿意国家动乱的广大学生和群众，要积极配合戒严部队执行好清场任务。”
    约五时左右，广场上的学生开始撤离，戒严部队同时进驻天安门广场。到五时半，整个过程结束。
    从３日凌晨到４日凌晨，暴徒们的种种暴行，只是这次反革命暴乱活动的一部分。但从中已足以看出，他们是何等猖獗，何等残忍，何等暴虐！他们用自己的罪恶事实，把他们的所谓“爱国精神”、所谓“促进民主”、所谓“热爱自由”、所谓“保护人权”、所谓“和平请愿”等等一切伪装，全部拆穿了，彻底撕光了。广大学生和人民群众，充分看清了他们的丑恶面目和反动本质。
    面对暴徒们的疯狂袭击和破坏，人民解放军戒严部队的指战员和武警战士、公安干警同志，严守纪律，团结一致，大义凛然，为了捍卫首都的安宁和祖国的尊严，捍卫中国共产党的领导和社会主义制度，捍卫革命、建设和改革的成果，捍卫广大工人、农民、知识分子和其他一切社会公民的生命安全和根本利益，他们发扬不怕疲劳、不怕流血牺牲的精神，正在胜利地粉碎这场反革命暴乱！他们的英勇行动和光荣功绩，受到广大学生和广大市民群众的热情赞颂和大力支持，他们不愧为党领导下的人民子弟兵，不愧为我们社会主义人民共和国的坚强柱石和钢铁长城。
