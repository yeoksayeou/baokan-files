The five-day-long India-Pakistan border negotiations concluded today here. Both sides discussed the disputed border demarcation issues in the Siachen region and the Rann of Kutch.

According to a joint press release by the Indian and Pakistani delegations, both sides also discussed the issue of maritime demarcation and agreed that the next round of negotiations will be held in New Delhi, the capital of India. The specific time has not been determined.

The border dispute between India and Pakistan in the Siachen region, which stretches 113 kilometers, is a legacy of the 1965 Indo-Pakistan War.

　　印巴边界谈判结束
    新华社伊斯兰堡６月２日电  为期五天的印度—巴基斯坦边界谈判，今天在这里结束。双方就有争议的克利克地区和库奇的边界划分问题进行了讨论。
    据印巴代表团联合发布的新闻公报说，双方还讨论了海域划分问题，并商定下次谈判将在印度首都新德里举行，具体时间未定。
    印巴之间在克利克地区的长达１１３公里的边界争端是１９６５年的印巴战争遗留下来的。
    １９６９年，双方曾就此争端举行过谈判，但毫无结果。
