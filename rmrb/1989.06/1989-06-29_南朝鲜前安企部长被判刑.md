Former South Korean Security Planning Agency Director Sentenced

	New York, June 29 (Xinhua) - Seoul: Former South Korean Security Planning Agency Director Jang Se-dong was sentenced to four years in prison for abusing his power while in office.

	During the tenure of former South Korean President Chun Doo-hwan, Jang Se-dong held positions such as Director of the Presidential Security Office and Director of the Security Planning Agency. He was known as a key figure in Chun Doo-hwan's corruption scandal. To build a residence for Chun Doo-hwan, he abused his power and unilaterally altered the city's urban planning.

	After Chun Doo-hwan stepped down, the South Korean National Assembly's Special Investigation Committee summoned Jang Se-dong last November to testify in the Daehan Financial Group's fundraising corruption case. At that time, Jang Se-dong denied any involvement in the political funding case.

	Early this year, while he was abroad, various South Korean groups called for authorities to investigate Jang Se-dong. He was urgently recalled and arrested for his involvement in the Daehan Financial Group's corruption case.

	On June 27, the Seoul District Court held a public trial and sentenced Jang Se-dong to four years in prison.

　　南朝鲜前安企部长被判刑
    新华社平壤六月二十九日电  汉城消息：南朝鲜前安全企划部长官张世东在职期间滥用职权，被判处四年徒刑。
    在南朝鲜前总统全斗焕执政期间，张世东曾任总统府警卫室室长、安全企划部长等职，被称作全斗焕舞弊案的核心人物。他为了给全斗焕建造住宅，竟滥用职权擅自修改城市规划。
    全斗焕下台后，南朝鲜国会特别调查委员会曾于去年十一月传讯张世东，令其就日海财团募捐舞弊案出席作证。当时，张世东否认他与政治资金案有关。
    今年初，在他出国期间，南朝鲜各界群众呼吁当局对张世东立案审查。他被紧急召回后，因与日海财团舞弊案有关被逮捕。
    六月二十七日，由汉城地方法院进行了公判，宣布判处张世东有期徒刑四年。
