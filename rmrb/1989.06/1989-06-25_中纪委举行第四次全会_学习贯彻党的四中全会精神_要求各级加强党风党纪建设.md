The Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission of the Communist Party of China was held in Beijing on June 24, 1989.

69 members of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission attended the session. Leaders from the discipline inspection departments of the central and state organs, as well as from various divisions of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, were also present. The main agenda of the session was to study and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee.

Jo Stone, Secretary of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, presided over the meeting.

The plenary session unanimously supported the report submitted by Li Peng on behalf of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, titled "On the Errors Committed by Zhao Ziyang in the Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Turmoil." It also unanimously supported the decision made by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee to remove Zhao Ziyang from his positions as General Secretary of the Central Committee, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau, member of the Political Bureau, member of the Central Committee, and First Deputy Chairman of the Central Military Commission, and to continue the investigation into his case. The plenary session also unanimously supported the adjustments made to the leadership of the central organs. The plenary session believed that the convening of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee was of great practical significance and far-reaching historical importance for further stabilizing the national situation and for continuing to firmly implement the line, principles, and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, to focus on economic construction, to adhere to the four cardinal principles, and to persist with reform and opening up.

The plenary session required that all levels of Party organizations and discipline inspection agencies must seriously study and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and the recent important speeches made by Deng Xiaoping. They must use these to unify the thoughts and actions of the entire Party. On the major issue of adhering to the four cardinal principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, they must take a firm stand, be clear-cut, and maintain a high degree of consistency with the Party Central Committee. The Party's discipline inspection agencies must seriously perform their duties and strictly enforce Party discipline. Those Party members who lost their political stance and violated Party discipline during this turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion must be strictly disciplined, up to and including expulsion from the Party. Those who committed crimes must be punished by the judicial organs according to law. For Party organizations that resisted the decisions of the Party Central Committee or were controlled and manipulated by bad elements during the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, decisive rectification and serious handling must be carried out. All levels of Party organizations and discipline inspection agencies must strengthen Party conduct and discipline, carry forward the Party's three major styles of work and the fine tradition of hard struggle, improve Party supervision, enhance organizational discipline, adhere to the principle of democratic centralism, and maintain the unity and solidarity of the Party. They must continue to implement the policy of strict governance of the Party, concentrate on investigating and dealing with serious and influential cases of Party members' violations of discipline, punish corrupt elements, purify the Party's ranks, and maintain the Party's image.

The plenary session called on all levels of Party discipline inspection agencies and all discipline inspection cadres to closely unite around the Party Central Committee, take the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee as the guideline, and strive to do a good job in discipline inspection work. They must make new contributions to maintaining the leadership of the Party Central Committee and promoting the development of socialist construction and the cause of reform and opening up.
