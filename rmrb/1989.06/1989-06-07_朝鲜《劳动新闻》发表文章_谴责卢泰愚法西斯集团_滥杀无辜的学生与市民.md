Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 7th.

North Korea's *Rodong Sinmun* today published an article titled "Murderers Will Not Escape Punishment," strongly condemning the fascist atrocities committed by Roh Tae-woo's military fascist group, which has been slaughtering innocent students and citizens.

The article states that South Korean police recently not only brutally murdered the young student Lee Cheol-gi but also killed an innocent citizen and a young man in his twenties in the early hours of June 4. The people and students of South Korea are outraged by the police's fascist actions, and the tide of condemnation is rising.

The article points out that after killing innocent people, the authorities fabricated lies, claiming "there is no evidence of death by torture." The article warns that just because "the dead cannot speak" does not mean that the murderers can cover up and escape their crimes.

The article exposes that the South Korean police's slaughter of innocents is not an isolated incident. This fully exposes the fascist nature of the Roh Tae-woo regime, which not only views young students and citizens advocating for national reunification and social democratization as "leftist movement" members but also arbitrarily arrests and imprisons them.

The article states that the situation shows that unless the Roh Tae-woo military fascist group is overthrown, the people of South Korea will not be able to escape bloodshed and death. The article concludes by stating that currently, the people of South Korea are filled with great indignation and are determined to fight fearlessly to demand justice for the bloodshed.

　　朝鲜《劳动新闻》发表文章
    谴责卢泰愚法西斯集团
    滥杀无辜的学生与市民
    本报平壤６月７日电  记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜《劳动新闻》今天发表题为《杀人凶手逃脱不了惩罚》的署名文章，强烈谴责卢泰愚军事法西斯集团滥杀无辜学生和市民的法西斯暴行。
    文章说，南朝鲜警察最近不仅残酷地杀害青年学生李哲魁，而且４日凌晨又杀害了一名无辜市民和一位２０多岁青年。南朝鲜人民和学生对法西斯警察的这种暴行义愤填膺，声讨浪潮不断高涨。
    文章指出，当局杀害无辜后为掩盖其罪行，造谣说“没有拷问致死的证据”。文章说，不要以为“死者不会说话”，就可以“掩盖和逃脱”杀人罪行。
    文章揭露说，南朝鲜警察屠杀无辜并非偶然。这充分暴露了卢泰愚政权的法西斯本质，他们不仅把要求祖国统一和社会民主化的青年学生和民众视为“左倾运动”分子，而且任意将他们逮捕入狱。
    文章说，事态表明，如果不推翻卢泰愚军事法西斯集团，南朝鲜人民就无法摆脱流血和死亡。文章最后指出，目前，南朝鲜人民正以极大的愤慨，决心以无畏的斗争，向杀人凶手讨还血债。
