On May 25, a serious armed robbery and murder case occurred in Shenyang: Two criminals robbed 190,000 yuan in broad daylight, shot and killed two people, and fled with the gun.

On that afternoon around 5 PM, individual tobacco vendor Cai En'guang and his wife Zhang Guilan returned home with a large sum of money after selling cigarettes in the Dadian District's Jinxing Community, Building 6, Unit 5, Floor 3. Two criminals followed and broke into the house, using a gun to threaten Cai, saying, "Don't move, or I'll shoot you." Zhang Guilan tried to escape to the balcony to call for help. Three gunshots were heard inside the house, and Cai En'guang was killed. The criminals grabbed the bag of money and ran away.

Chen Xiu'de, an employee of Shenyang Automobile Manufacturing Factory, heard the screams and went to the door to intercept the criminals. He managed to grab one of the criminals who was about to escape on a bicycle. The criminal shot Chen, who sustained serious injuries to his abdomen and fell to the ground. Meanwhile, Long Wei, an accountant from the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's Liaoning-Shenyang Branch, arrived and was shot and killed by the criminal. Three more people were injured in the chase.

Both criminals escaped, and relevant departments are currently investigating and pursuing the case.
