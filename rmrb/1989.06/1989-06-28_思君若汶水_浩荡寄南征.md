Twenty years ago, our country's outstanding leader in public security and counterintelligence work, the seasoned revolutionary comrade Xu Zirong, died unjustly and left the cause he had been pursuing. On the occasion of his twentieth anniversary, we, who had fought side by side with him, still remember his appearance, his smile, and his practical, honest, open-minded, diligent, and incorruptible character. We cherish his achievements and offer our deep remembrance.

	Hardships Tempered a Hero

	Xu Zirong was born in 1907 in a peasant family in Xiuman, Henan. Influenced by his elder brother, he sympathized with the revolution from a young age. In early 1927, he participated in the Xiuman peasant uprising led by Ma Shangde (Yang Jingyu) and Li Mingqi, and joined the Communist Party of China during the uprising. In September, he served as the secretary of the Xiuman County Committee, continuing to lead underground struggles. The following year, after the third uprising in Xiuman failed, Comrade Zirong was sent by the party organization to Beijing to engage in underground activities. He hid in the National University, secretly organizing the "Left League" association and setting up "People's Night School." After the "September 18 Incident," he devoted himself entirely to anti-Japanese patriotic activities.

	In the summer of 1933, the CPC Beijing Municipal Committee and Military Committee decided to hold a rehearsal for an uprising on August 1 to commemorate the fifth anniversary of the Nanchang Uprising and to promote anti-Japanese sentiment. On that day, Xu Zirong carried a box of pamphlets disguised as a "snack box" to the gathering place but was caught by the gendarmes. Xu Zirong insisted that the "snack box" was picked up on the road and that he had no idea what was inside. Since there was no other evidence, the reactionary authorities could only sentence him to six years in prison for "disturbing public order" and sent him to the Military Re-education Camp (also known as Caolangzi Prison). Under the leadership of the underground party branch in Caolangzi Prison, Xu Zirong participated in a series of struggles against interrogation and hunger strikes. He also assisted the underground party branch's living committee, Zhao Fu, in managing daily life, caring for the sick, and working to win over the prison guards and officials. In September 1936, after being rescued by the party organization, Xu Zirong was immediately sent to Taiyuan to serve as the secretary of the Shanxi Work Committee. In early 1938, the CPC Jin-Ji-Yu Provincial Committee (later known as the Taihang Area Party Committee) was established, and he successively served as the head of the Propaganda Department and the Organization Department. Later, he was sent to the Taihang Fifth District to serve as the secretary of the District Committee and the political commissar of the Military Sub-district. In May 1944, the dying Japanese invaders gathered 50,000 to 60,000 troops to launch the "Henan Campaign." The Nationalist Army collapsed without a fight, handing over vast territories in western Henan to the Japanese invaders. At this critical moment, the North China Bureau of the CPC and the headquarters of the Eighth Route Army ordered the Taihang Fifth District units led by Pi Dingjin and Xu Zirong to form the "Henan People's Anti-Japanese Advance Guard," cross the Yellow River, advance into enemy territory, and establish an anti-Japanese base. Comrade Xu Zirong, as the political commissar of this unit, together with Comrade Pi Dingjin, led the troops through more than a year of bloody battles, establishing an anti-Japanese democratic base centered around Mount Song, including more than ten counties such as Luoyang, Dengfeng, Mi County, and Xingyang, tying down and striking the Japanese invaders.

	After the Chongqing negotiations, the Henan Anti-Japanese Advance Guard was incorporated into the New Fourth Army's Fifth Division led by Li Xiannian and Zheng Weisan, and was reorganized into the First Brigade of the Central Plains Military Region. In June 1946, Chiang Kai-shek launched a civil war, gathering 300,000 regular troops to surround the 60,000-strong main force of the Central Plains, which was confined to a narrow strip of land 200 li east-west and 50 li north-south, intending to annihilate them in one go. To foil the enemy's plot, the Central Plains Bureau, following the instructions of the Central Committee, ordered Li Xiannian to lead the main force to break out of the encirclement, leaving a small, elite force to cover the retreat and ensure the main force's withdrawal. This honorable and arduous task fell to the First Brigade. After thorough analysis and repeated consideration, Comrade Zirong proposed a plan at the brigade party committee meeting: wait for the main force to cross the railway line, then the First Brigade would make a feint and follow closely behind, hiding after half a day to avoid the enemy's sharp edge, then turn east and march quickly to confuse the enemy, making them mistakenly believe that the main force had not yet crossed the river, thus reducing the pressure on the advancing main force. By the time the enemy realized the situation, the main force had already marched hundreds of li. This plan was approved by Comrade Pi Dingjun, who thought it was a bold yet safe plan. The brigade party committee unanimously decided to carry it out. This force of only over 5,000 people, under the command of Comrades Pi Dingjun and Xu Zirong, after 24 days and nights of continuous marching and fighting, from the Dabie Mountains in Henan, through Anhui, to Jiangsu, overcame unprecedented difficulties and dangers, broke through the enemy's pursuit and blockade, completed the covering mission with minimal losses, and advanced to Huai'an, where they successfully joined forces with the Huaihai Military Region.

	Subsequently, this force, under the command of Chen Yi, Su Yu, and Xu Xiangqian, fought bravely and tenaciously in major battles such as Lianhuai, Laiwu, Menglianggu, and Jinzhong, achieving remarkable victories and writing a glorious chapter. As the main leader of the unit, Comrade Xu Zirong devoted all his energy and wisdom, earning the praise of his superiors and comrades and being recognized as an outstanding talent.

	Devoting All Efforts to Public Security Work

	After the founding of New China, Xu Zirong was assigned by the Central Military Commission to work in the Ministry of Public Security, initially serving as the director of the Office and the director of the Personnel Department, and later as the deputy minister and deputy secretary of the party group. He followed the instructions of the Central Committee, assisted Comrade Luo Ronghui in formulating a series of policies, principles, and regulations for public security work, and did a great deal of work in organizing and building the public security force, developing professional skills, and training police officers.

	When he first arrived at the Ministry of Public Security, Comrade Zirong, entrusted by Luo Ronghui, took on the task of building the public security force. He always adhered to the party's principle of "selecting the best people," the organizational principle of "drawing from the four seas," and the standard of "both virtue and talent." He valued the selection of workers and peasants as cadres and the use of cadres with intellectual backgrounds. To ensure the purity of this force in terms of organization and political ideology, he followed the practice of the People's Liberation Army and established political departments in the public security system nationwide starting in 1952 to be responsible for the education, training, and evaluation of public security cadres. He devoted his heart and soul to building a public security force that criminals fear and the people love.

	Everyone who had contact with Comrade Zirong admired his diligence, hard work, and meticulousness in his work. The documents, reports, and summaries he was in charge of were often personally reviewed and revised, word by word and sentence by sentence, without the slightest negligence. The materials sent by the business departments and local authorities were usually annotated with his opinions after reading. For unclear matters, he would consult with relevant comrades or personally conduct investigations. After the suppression of counter-revolutionaries in 1954, Comrade Zirong vigorously advocated for the strengthening of business departments, especially in investigation work, public security work, and the foundation work of police stations, where he devoted the most effort.

	During the three years of difficulty, internal problems among the people were prominent, especially in some disaster-stricken areas where the masses seized collective property, stole, and even looted, which was quite serious. How to solve this problem was crucial for maintaining social order. At that time, the Minister of Public Security, Xie Fuzhi, advocated for "intensifying class struggle" and wanted local public security organs to use dictatorial means to solve these problems. Comrade Zirong opposed this wrong policy. He believed that the root cause of mass theft and looting was the difficulty in people's lives. For the wrongdoings of the disaster-stricken masses, on the one hand, education was needed, and on the other hand, various levels of government and party committees should help them solve practical difficulties and arrange their lives to get through the temporary hardship, rather than treating them with the methods used against class enemies. He further proposed that in the face of serious famine, the policy towards law-breaking masses could only be one of guidance, not standing in opposition to the masses and exacerbating contradictions. He summarized this policy as: "resolve but do not create," "follow but do not provoke," "dispel but do not gather." Various levels of public security organs handled this internal contradiction among the people correctly according to this principle. Comrade Zirong also personally went to the disaster-stricken areas with more problems to conduct on-site inspections, guiding local public security officers to care for the people's hardships and help them overcome temporary difficulties, doing a good job in public security work.

	Comrade Zirong paid great attention to and was good at handling contradictions between the enemy and us. He often reminded cadres that in handling contradictions between the enemy and us, one must be extremely cautious, and while not letting a single bad person go, one must also protect the good people. For those whose status as an enemy or a friend was not clear at the time, a "middle ground" should be drawn, and all such cases should be temporarily handled as internal contradictions among the people. Looking back now, Comrade Zirong's views have stood the test of practice, and at that time, they were particularly precious.

	Xu Zirong was known for his pragmatic working style. He approached matters from a practical perspective, thought independently, and often went to county public security bureaus, urban public security sub-bureaus, and police stations to inspect work and understand and grasp the situation at the grassroots level. In the late 1950s, as "leftist" ideas became more prevalent, he was very cautious about the "Great Leap Forward" in public security work and wanted cadres to consider problems calmly and not promote unrealistic slogans. Once, he went to a police station to understand the situation and heard people discussing the advantages of the masses solving cases, breaking multiple long-standing cases in the police station in just three days. Comrade Zirong immediately pointed out that attention should be paid to the masses solving cases, otherwise, it would lead to wrongful convictions. He personally reviewed the case files and overturned several false cases. After returning to Beijing, he also reminded everyone many times to pay attention to this problem and repeatedly said at the party group meetings: "We must thoroughly review the cases we handle to ensure that every statement, every piece of evidence, and every crime are accurate. We should not wait until tens of years, hundreds of years, or even a century later for our descendants to say that we did not act according to law."

	On the eve of the Cultural Revolution, at an expanded meeting of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau held in Shanghai, Lin Biao slandered Luo Ronghui for "opposing the prominence of politics," "usurping power and opposing the party," and "installing eavesdropping devices for the central leaders," launching a sudden attack on Luo. Xie Fuzhi, following Lin's intentions, wanted Xu Zirong to be responsible for organizing the collection of evidence of Luo's anti-party activities in the Ministry of Public Security. Comrade Zirong, with a clear attitude and a sense of responsibility, conducted an on-site investigation of the eavesdropping device issue, foiling Lin Biao's plot, and reminded the staff: "When reading documents, one must read the whole text, understand the historical background at that time, and not 'attack one point' or 'fabricate without evidence' and act arbitrarily."

	Sincere and Kind, Learned and Thoughtful

	Comrade Zirong always acted in the interests of the people and for the interests of the people. He maintained a sincere heart to protect the blood-and-flesh bond between the party and the people. In 1943, the Taihang Mountain base area was in a year of great disaster. Comrade Zirong's Fifth District had suffered several rounds of Japanese atrocities, and natural disasters such as drought and locusts had made the situation even worse. The people had to fill their stomachs with tree leaves, grass roots, and "Guanyin soil," and many people were severely swollen. At this critical moment, as the district committee secretary, Comrade Zirong personally led the cadres, taking their own rations, to the most severely affected areas, helping the people to save seedlings, water the fields, and exterminate locusts, and distributing their rations to the people.

	In the late 1960s, during the three years of difficulty, Xu Zirong and Wang Congwu went to Henan to correct "leftist" errors. He saw the people's hardships and had many thoughts. He often used Du Fu's "Again Presented to Wulang" and Wei Yingwu's "To Li Yuanshi" to inspire himself and educate the cadres, saying with deep emotion that even feudal officials felt ashamed to receive their salaries because of the "floating population" in their counties. If we ignore the lives and deaths of the people, then we are not even as good as feudal officials.

	Comrade Zirong cared for and loved the cadres, doing a very detailed job in ideological work, and was a respected elder in everyone's heart. In his early days as the head of the Organization Department in Taihang, the cadres all said that the Organization Department was like a family, and Comrade Xu was like the "mother" of the family. Everyone was willing to be close to him and willing to talk to him about anything. During the most intense and tense moments of the Central Plains breakout, he was concerned about the women in the unit giving birth, arranging stretchers and red sugar everywhere. After going to the Ministry of Public Security, he often had heart-to-heart talks with the cadres or chatted about family matters, with no airs at all. He even took an interest in the marital and family disputes of some cadres. For cadres who made mistakes, he insisted on the principle of "punishing the past and preventing the future, curing the illness and saving the person," criticizing severely but handling cautiously, and taking the initiative to assume leadership responsibility to shield the cadres from the wind and rain. During the Jinzhong Campaign, a regimental commander abandoned his position and retreated. The commander wanted to execute him according to military law. Comrade Zirong, after thoroughly understanding the situation, invited the commander to inspect the terrain on the spot, proving that withdrawing from the position was correct, but acting without authorization was wrong. He severely criticized the regimental commander on the one hand and asked the commander to withdraw the "execution order" on the other, which deeply moved the regimental commander, who later achieved many victories in battle. Whenever it came to the handling of people, he always carefully understood the overall situation, patiently and meticulously did work on all sides, did not speak rashly, and did not act impulsively. Several comrades in the Ministry of Public Security were given incorrect conclusions due to historical reasons, which affected their use. After Comrade Zirong learned the truth, he personally conducted investigations, clarified the problems, and removed the burdens that these comrades had carried for many years.

	Comrade Zirong was a leader with an intellectual background. He was well-read, knowledgeable, good at thinking, and had foresight. He often read until late at night, and even during business trips, he seized the time to read. He valued the cultural learning of cadres and instructed those engaged in fieldwork to seize the time to study, "not to run thin legs and an empty brain," and "not to know the Han, let alone the Wei and Jin dynasties." He often used historical anecdotes to educate those around him, using vivid, concise language and profound analogies to blend his insights into jokes, making people feel very close.

	Xu Zirong had a democratic style, never boasting, self-righteous, or acting alone. He always spoke in a consultative tone and a shared research attitude, encouraging others to express their views, not interrupting others' speeches, and not using his authority to pressure others. As early as the second party congress of the Ministry of Public Security in 1952, he required all cadres to be clean in their governance and to work diligently. After the "Three Antis" and "Five Antis" campaigns in the Ministry of Public Security in 1957, to consolidate the results, Comrade Zirong presided over the drafting of relevant regulations and institutions, calling for public supervision. In 1963, as the phenomenon of "five excesses" increased within the organization, he took the lead in checking bureaucratic tendencies and was praised by the Central Committee.

	Twenty years have passed, and our longing for Comrade Xu Zirong has never faded. His lofty character and revolutionary spirit of being loyal to the revolutionary cause, seeking truth from facts, being clean and upright, approachable, and thrifty, have always inspired us to continue to strive for the cause of the party and the people in the new era.

　　思君若汶水　浩荡寄南征
    刘澜涛　郭林祥　王芳　刘复之
    二十年前，我国公安保卫工作的卓越领导人，久经考验的无产阶级革命家徐子荣同志含冤而逝，过早地离开了他所孜孜以求的事业。在他二十周年祭日的时刻，我们这些与他并肩战斗过的人，犹记他的音容笑貌，以及他那实事求是，质朴豁达，勤奋洁廉的品德，缅怀他的业绩，献上我们深深的思念。
    　　　　坎坷磨练成英才
    １９０７年，徐子荣出生在河南确山一个农民家庭，受兄长的影响，少年就同情革命。１９２７年初，参加了由马尚德（即杨靖宇）、李鸣歧领导的确山农民起义，在起义中加入了中国共产党。９月，任确山县委书记，坚持领导地下斗争。翌年底，确山第三次起义失败后，子荣同志被党组织派往北平从事地下活动。他掩护在国民大学，秘密组织“左联”社团，举办“民众夜校”。“九一八事变”以后，他全身心地投入了抗日爱国活动。
    １９３３年夏天，中共北平市委、军委为纪念南昌起义五周年，宣传抗日，决定在８月１日举行暴动预演。当天徐子荣携带以“点心盒”伪装的传单向集会地进发，途中被宪兵查出被捕。徐子荣一口咬定“点心盒”是在路上拣的，根本不知内装何物。因没有其他证据，反动当局只好以“扰乱社会治安”的罪名判刑６年，押入军人反省分院（即草岚子监狱）。在草岚子监狱地下党支部的领导下，徐子荣投入了狱中的“反审查”、绝食等一系列斗争，还协助地下党支部生活委员赵缚管理生活、照顾病号，并对狱中的看守和狱吏做争取工作。１９３６年９月，徐子荣同志经党组营救出狱后，立即被派往太原任山西工委秘书长。１９３８年初，中共晋冀豫省委（后称太行区党委）成立，他先后任宣传部、组织部部长。以后又被派往太行五分区，任地委书记兼军分区政委。１９４４年５月，垂死挣扎的日寇集结五六万兵力发动“河南战役”，国民党军队不战而溃，把豫西的大片国土拱手让给日本侵略者。在这危急时刻，中共北方局和八路军总部命令太行五分区皮（定钧）、徐（子荣）所部，组成“豫西人民抗日先遣队”，强渡黄河，挺进敌后，开辟抗日根据地。徐子荣同志作为这支部队的政委，同皮定钧同志一道率领部队经过一年多的浴血苦战，建立了以嵩山为中心，包括洛阳、登封、密县、荥阳等十余县的抗日民主根据地，牵制和打击日寇。
    重庆谈判之后，豫西抗日先遣队并入李先念、郑位三同志领导的新四军第五师，被编为中原军区第一纵队第一旅。１９４６年６月，蒋介石发动内战，集结３０万人的正规军，将只有６万人的我中原主力包围在东西２００里，南北５０里的狭长地带，妄图一举歼灭。为了粉碎敌人的阴谋，中原局根据中央的指示命令李先念率主力突围，留下一支精干部队作掩护，保障主力部队西撤。这项光荣而艰巨的任务落到了第一旅肩上。经过深入细致的分析和反复思索，子荣同志在旅党委会上提出一个方案：待主力部队过了铁路线，第一旅便虚晃一枪紧跟其后，走上一半天就隐蔽下来，躲过敌军的锋芒，然后掉头向东急行军，迷惑敌人，使之产生错觉，减轻西进主力的压力，等敌人弄清情况时，主力部队已经走出数百里了。这一方案得到皮定均同志的赞成，认为这是一个大胆而又稳妥的方案，旅党委一致决定照此行事。这支仅有五千多人的部队，在皮定均、徐子荣同志指挥下，经过２４昼夜的连续行军、激战，由河南的大别山，经安徽，到江苏，全体将士戮力同心，克服了罕见的艰难险阻，冲破了敌军的围追堵截，以最小的损失，完成了掩护任务，挺进到淮安，同华中军区胜利会师。
    此后，这支部队，先后在陈毅、粟裕和徐向前的指挥下，在涟水、莱芜、孟良崮、晋中等重大战役中，勇猛顽强，屡建奇功，写下了可歌可泣的光荣篇章。作为部队的主要领导人，徐子荣同志贡献出自己的全部精力和才智，赢得了上级领导和同志们的赞许，是公认的英才。
    　　　　为公安工作殚精竭智
    新中国成立以后，徐子荣奉中央军委之命调到公安部工作，初任办公厅主任兼人事局局长，不久任公安部常务副部长、党组副书记。他遵照党中央的要求，协助罗瑞卿同志制定了公安工作的一系列方针、政策和法规，为公安战线的组织建设、业务建设、干警培训做了大量的工作。
    初到公安部之时，子荣受罗瑞卿的重托，承担了组建公安队伍的重任，他始终坚持党的“任人为贤”的干部路线、五湖四海的组织原则和德才兼备的标准；既重视对工农干部的挑选，又重视知识分子出身干部的使用；为了保证这支队伍在组织上特别是政治思想上的纯洁，参照人民解放军的作法，自１９５２年起全国公安系统普遍建立了政治部，负责公安干部的教育、培训、考核。在建设一支罪犯惧怕、人民喜爱的公安队伍费尽了心血。
    凡是与子荣同志有接触的人，无不佩服他工作上的勤奋、刻苦、认真，他主管的工作，不论是文件、报告，还是总结常常是亲自审改，字斟句酌，一丝不苟。业务局和各地送来的材料，他阅后一般都批上意见，不讲模棱两可的话。对下边送来的请示报告，不清楚的他都找有关同志商量和亲自去调查研究。１９５４年镇压反革命运动结束后，子荣同志即大力提倡业务部门要加强建设，特别是对侦查工作、治安工作和派出所基础工作，他耗费的心血尤多。
    三年困难时期，人民内部的问题比较突出，特别是一部分灾区的群众侵占集体财产，小偷小摸，甚至哄抢事件相当严重，如何解决这一问题对维护社会治安至关重要。当时的公安部长谢富治主张“把阶级斗争搞得更紧一些”，要各地公安机关运用专政手段来解决这些问题。子荣同志反对这个错误方针，他认为造成群众性的偷拿、哄抢等问题，主要是因为群众生活困难。对灾区群众的错误行为，一方面要教育，一方面要由各级政府、党委出面帮助他们解决实际困难，安排好生活，度过暂时的难关，而决不能以对待阶级敌人的办法去对待因生活困难而有违法行为的基本群众。进而，他提出在灾荒情况严重的形势下，对待违法群众只能采取疏导的方针，而不能站在群众的对立面，激化矛盾，他把这一方针概括为：“可解不可结”，“可顺不可激”，“可散不可聚”。各级公安机关按照这一原则，正确地处理了这一人民内部矛盾。子荣同志还亲赴问题较多的重灾区实地考察，指导当地公安干警关心群众疾苦，帮助群众克服暂时困难，把治安工作做好。
    子荣同志十分重视并善于处理敌我之间的问题，他经常告诫干部，对于敌我之间矛盾的处理，要慎之又慎，在不放过一个坏人的前提下，尤应保护好人，对那些一时间区分不清是敌还是我的问题，要划分一个“中间地带”，一律暂做人民内部矛盾处理。现在看来，子荣同志的见解是经得起实践检验的，就当时来讲，更是十分难能可贵的。
    徐子荣是以实事求是的工作作风而著称的，他遇事从实际出发，独立思考，经常深入到县公安局、城市公安分局、派出所考察工作，了解和掌握基层的情况。在５０年代后期，“左”的东西逐渐盛行，他对公安工作“大跃进”是十分谨慎的，要干部冷静的考虑问题，不要推广无法实现的口号。一次，他到派出所了解情况，听到人们议论群众办案好处很多，三天之内就破完了派出所的多年积案，子荣同志当即指出，对群众破案要予以注意，不然会造成冤假错案。他亲自复查案卷，推倒了几个假案。回北京后，他还多次提醒大家要注意这个问题，数次在党组会上讲：我们对经手办的案件要切实复查，使每份口供、每句证询、每条罪行都确实无误，不要等到十几年、几十年、上百年后让我们的子孙后代说我们不依法办事。
    “文革”前夕，在上海举行的中央政治局常委扩大会议上，林彪诬蔑罗瑞卿“反对突出政治”、“篡军反党”，“为中央领导同志安装了窃听器”，对罗进行突然袭击。谢富治秉承其意，要徐子荣负责组织搜集罗在公安部从事反党活动的证据。子荣同志以清醒的态度和敢于负责的精神，对窃听器问题进行了实地调查，粉碎了林彪的阴谋，并告诫办事人员：看文件一定要纵观全文，弄清当时的历史背景，不要“攻其一点”，更不要“无中生有”，想当然行事。
    　　　　赤诚宽厚，博学多思
    一切从人民的利益出发，一切为了人民的利益，这是子荣同志所终生坚定奉行的。他以一颗赤诚的心维护党与人民群众之间的那种血肉相连的关系。１９４３年是太行山根据地灾难深重的一年，子荣同志所在的五分区，几经日寇的烧杀抢掠，加上天旱蝗灾等自然灾害，老百姓以树叶、草根、“观音土”充饥，许多人严重浮肿。在这严峻关头，作为地委书记的子荣同志亲自带领干部，带上自己的口粮，到情况最严重的地方，替群众下地抢苗、浇水、扑蝗，把口粮分给群众吃。
    ６０年代三年困难的后期，徐子荣和王从吾同志到河南去纠正“左”的错误，他看到人民的疾苦，感触很多，常以杜甫的《又呈吴郎》和韦应物的《寄李元锡》两首诗，来激励自己，教育干部，语重心长地说，封建官吏尚因“邑有流亡”而愧领俸禄，我们若置人民生死于不顾，那么就连封建官吏都不如了。
    子荣同志关心爱护干部，做人的思想工作很细致，是大家心目中的一位忠厚长者。早年他在太行做组织部长时，干部们都说组织部像个家，徐部长就是家里的“老妈妈”。大家都愿意和他亲近，什么事也愿意同他说。在中原突围最激烈、紧张的时刻，部队里女同志生孩子的事他都惦念着，四处张罗担架、红糖。到公安部以后，常同干部谈心或话家常，没有一点架子，连一些干部的婚姻、家庭纠纷等问题他都过问。对犯了错误的干部，他坚持“惩前毖后、治病救人”的原则，批评严厉、处理谨慎，并主动承担领导责任，为干部遮风挡雨。晋中战役时，一位团长放弃阵地退了下来，司令员要按军法处理。子荣同志在深入了解情况后，邀请司令员去实地观察地形，证明撤出阵地是正确的，但未经请示擅自行动是错误的。他一面严肃批评团长，一面请司令员收回“杀”令，使这位团长颇受感动，在以后的战斗中屡立战功。只要涉及到对人的处理，他总是缜密地了解全面情况，耐心细致地做各方面的工作，不讲过激的话，不意气用事。公安部有好几位同志由于历史原因被作了错误结论，影响对他们的使用，子荣同志了解真情后，亲自做调查，澄清问题后，卸掉了这些同志背了多年的包袱。
    子荣同志是位知识分子出身的领导干部，他博览群书，学识丰富，善于思考，具有远见卓识，经常是手不释卷直到深夜，在公出的旅途中也抓紧时间读书。他重视干部的文化学习，嘱咐搞外勤的同志要抓紧时间学习，“不要把脚跑细了，脑子跑荒了”，“不知有汉，何论魏晋”。他常以历史上的典故教育身边的人，用生动简洁的语言和精辟的比喻把自己的真知灼见揉在笑话中，使人倍感亲切。
    徐子荣作风民主，从不夸夸其谈，自以为是，一个人说了算，而总是以商量的口气、共同研究的态度，启发别人说出自己的看法，不中途打断别人的讲话，不以势压人。早在１９５２年的公安部机关第二次党代会上，他就要求全体干部要为政清廉，要踏踏实实地工作。１９５７年公安部机关“三反”“五反”后，为巩固成果，子荣同志主持起草了有关的规章制度，号召群众监督。１９６３年机关内部“五多”现象有所增加，他带头检查官僚主义作风，受到了中央的表扬。
    二十年过去了，我们对徐子荣同志的思念之情从未释怀。他对革命事业赤胆忠心、实事求是、廉洁奉公、平易近人、艰苦朴素的崇高品德和革命精神，一直激励着我们在新时期为党和人民的事业继续奋斗。
