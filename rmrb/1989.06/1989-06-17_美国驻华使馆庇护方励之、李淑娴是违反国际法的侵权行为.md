The U.S. Embassy in China's sheltering of Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian is an act of international law violation.

Vice President of the Chinese Law Society, Chen Weidian

Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian have committed the crime of counter-revolutionary propaganda and incitement, violating Article 102 of the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China. They have been legally approved for arrest by the Beijing Municipal Procuratorate Branch, and the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau has issued an arrest warrant on June 11. This is a legitimate act of a sovereign state exercising its criminal jurisdiction within its own territory, which should be respected by the international community. No foreign country has the right to interfere.

However, after the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing in early June, the two criminals, Fang and Li, fled to the U.S. Embassy in China seeking so-called "protection." The U.S. Embassy in China blatantly provided shelter to these two fugitives. The U.S. Embassy's actions not only violate China's relevant laws but also violate internationally recognized rules of international law and contradict the basic principles of Sino-U.S. diplomatic relations. This is a blatant interference by the U.S. Embassy in China in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China.

Firstly, the U.S. Embassy in China's sheltering of Fang and Li is in violation of the relevant provisions of the Regulations of the People's Republic of China on Diplomatic Privileges and Immunities. These regulations provide legal protection for the privileges and immunities of foreign embassies and their personnel in China; at the same time, they also stipulate the obligations that foreign diplomatic personnel enjoying privileges and immunities in China must fulfill. Article 25 of these regulations states: "Persons enjoying diplomatic privileges and immunities shall: (1) respect the laws and regulations of China; (2) not interfere in the internal affairs of China; (3) not engage in any private business or commercial activities within the territory of China; (4) not use the premises of the embassy or the residences of embassy staff for purposes unrelated to the duties of the embassy." These are the legal obligations that all embassies and their personnel in China must bear. The U.S. Embassy in China and its personnel are, of course, no exception. However, the U.S. Embassy in China has disregarded the aforementioned provisions of Article 25, items (1), (2), and (4), blatantly failing to "respect the laws of China." Article 3 of China's Criminal Law states: "All crimes committed within the territory of the People's Republic of China shall be subject to this Law, except as otherwise provided by law"; "If any act or result of a crime occurs within the territory of the People's Republic of China, it shall be deemed a crime within the territory of the People's Republic of China." The facts show that whether it is the criminal acts committed by Fang and Li or the criminal results they caused, all occurred within the territory of China. Therefore, it is only natural that the Criminal Law of the People's Republic of China should be applied to them, and they should be arrested and punished according to law. However, the U.S. Embassy in China, disregarding China's legal provisions, obstructed China's legitimate exercise of criminal jurisdiction within its own territory, actually using its "embassy premises for purposes unrelated to the duties of the embassy" as a shelter for Fang and Li, who are wanted and arrested by Chinese public security authorities. Can this still be said to be not a blatant "interference in the internal affairs of China"?

Secondly, the U.S. Embassy in China's sheltering of Fang and Li is in violation of internationally recognized rules of international law. According to internationally recognized rules of international law, embassies abroad may not use their premises as shelters for any criminals. Anyone sheltered in an embassy is a complete violation of international law and an infringement on the sovereignty of the host country. Article 41, paragraph 1, of the 1961 Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations states: "Without prejudice to their privileges and immunities, all persons enjoying such privileges and immunities have a duty to respect the laws and regulations of the receiving State. They also have a duty not to interfere in the internal affairs of that State." Paragraph 3 of the same article further states: "The premises of the mission shall not be used in any manner incompatible with the functions of the mission as laid down in the present Convention or by other rules of general international law or by special agreement in force between the sending and the receiving State." These are the international law rules that all embassies abroad, diplomatic representatives, and other persons enjoying diplomatic privileges and immunities must strictly adhere to in their actions and activities, and are the legal obligations they bear towards the host country. Since the United States is also a party to this Convention, it should have the obligation and responsibility to strictly abide by and accept the constraints of this Convention. It is strange that the United States, which always claims to be a "rule of law" country, allows its embassy in China to disregard the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations, openly welcoming Fang and Li, who are wanted and arrested by Chinese public security authorities, into its embassy and providing them with shelter. The International Court of Justice has pointed out in its judgment on the asylum case that diplomatic asylum involves damage to the sovereignty of that country, making the criminal not subject to the jurisdiction of the local state, and thus interfering with matters within the exclusive jurisdiction of that country. Obviously, the U.S. Embassy in China's sheltering of Fang and Li is a damage and infringement on China's sovereignty, attempting to make Fang and Li evade China's criminal jurisdiction. Can this still be said to be not a public interference with China's exclusive internal affairs?

Thirdly, the U.S. Embassy in China's sheltering of Fang and Li is in violation of the fundamental principles guiding Sino-U.S. relations. It is well known that in the famous 1972 Shanghai Communiqué, China and the United States "agree that all countries, regardless of their social systems, should handle state-to-state relations on the basis of respect for each other's sovereignty and territorial integrity, non-aggression, non-interference in each other's internal affairs, equality and mutual benefit, and peaceful coexistence." "The United States and the People's Republic of China are prepared to apply these principles in their relations with each other." In the 1978 communiqué on the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and the United States, it was again "reaffirmed that the principles agreed upon in the Shanghai Communiqué." In the 1982 communiqué, the two sides reaffirmed that "mutual respect for sovereignty and territorial integrity and non-interference in each other's internal affairs are the fundamental principles guiding Sino-U.S. relations." Although the U.S. government has repeatedly agreed and reaffirmed, the fact that it is now sheltering Fang and Li shows that the U.S. government has not fully honored its assurances of "no intention to infringe on China's sovereignty" and "no intention to interfere in China's internal affairs."

It should also be pointed out that non-interference in internal affairs is not just a principle guiding bilateral relations between China and the United States, but has long been an internationally recognized basic norm for handling relations between countries in the international community. For example, the United Nations General Assembly, in 1965 and 1970, adopted the Declaration on the Inadmissibility of Intervention in the Domestic Affairs of States and the Protection of Their Independence and Sovereignty and the Declaration on Principles of International Law Concerning Friendly Relations and Cooperation Among States in Accordance with the Charter of the United Nations, both of which stipulate that "no State has the right, for whatever reason, to intervene directly or indirectly, for any reason whatsoever, in the internal or external affairs of any other State," and that all States have the obligation "to refrain from any action aimed at the partial or total disruption of the national unity and territorial integrity of any State or country and which constitutes a violation of the purposes and principles of the Charter." However, the U.S. Embassy in China's sheltering of Fang and Li, interfering in China's internal affairs, not only violates the basic norms of international relations but also infringes on the sovereignty of the People's Republic of China. We have every reason to demand that the U.S. Embassy in China stop such interference in the internal affairs of the People's Republic of China.

　　美国驻华使馆庇护方励之、李淑娴是违反国际法的侵权行为
    中国法学会副会长  陈为典
    方励之、李淑娴因犯有反革命宣传煽动罪，触犯了《中华人民共和国刑法》第一百零二条，业经北京市检察院分院依法批准逮捕，北京市公安局已于６月１１日发出了通缉令。这是作为一个主权国家在自己领域内依法行使刑事管辖权的正当行为，理应受到国际社会的尊重，任何外国无权干涉。
    可是，在６月初北京发生反革命暴乱后，方、李二犯畏罪逃入美国驻华大使馆寻求所谓“保护”，而美国驻华使馆却公然对这两名逃犯给予庇护。美国驻华使馆这一举动，既违反了中国的有关法律，也违反了公认的国际法规则，还违背了中美建交的基本原则。这是美国驻华使馆对中华人民共和国内政的粗暴干涉。
    　　首先，美国驻华使馆对方、李二犯的庇护行为，违反了《中华人民共和国外交特权与豁免条例》的有关规定。这个条例，对外国驻华使馆及其使馆人员的特权与豁免，提供了法律保障；同时，也确定了享有外交特权与豁免的外国驻华人员应履行的义务。该条例第二十五条规定：“享有外交特权与豁免的人员：（一），应当尊重中国的法律、法规；（二），不得干涉中国的内政；（三），不得在中国境内为私人利益从事任何职业或者商业活动；（四），不得将使馆馆舍和使馆工作人员寓所充作与使馆职务不相符合的用途。”这是一切驻华使馆和使馆人员所应承担的法律义务。美国驻华使馆及其使馆人员，当然也不能例外。但是，美国驻华使馆却无视上述第二十五条之一、二、四项的规定，公然不“尊重中国的法律”。我国刑法第三条规定：“凡在中华人民共和国领域内犯罪的，除法律有特别规定的以外，都适用本法”；“犯罪的行为或者结果有一项发生在中华人民共和国领域内的，就认为是在中华人民共和国领域内犯罪。”事实表明，方、李二犯不论其实施的犯罪行为，还是其所造成的犯罪结果，都是发生在中国领域内，理所当然地必须适用中华人民共和国刑法，将他们逮捕归案，依法惩处。然而，美国驻华使馆却不顾中国的法律规定，阻挠我国在自己领域内正当行使刑事管辖权，居然将其“使馆馆舍充作与使馆职务不相符合的用途”，用作被我公安机关通缉逮捕的方、李二犯的庇护所。这难道还能说不是粗暴地“干涉中国的内政”吗？
    其次，美国驻华使馆对方、李二犯的庇护行为，违反了公认的国际法规则。按照公认的国际法规则，驻外使馆不得将其馆舍作为任何罪犯的庇护所。凡在使馆馆舍内庇护人犯，既是完全违反国际法规则的行为，也是侵犯接受国主权的行为。１９６１年《维也纳外交关系公约》第４１条第一款规定：“在不妨碍外交特权与豁免之情形下，凡享有此项特权与豁免之人员，均负有尊重接受国法律规章之义务。此等人员并负有不干涉该国内政之义务。”同条第三款还规定：“使馆馆舍不得充作与本公约或一般国际法之其他规则、或派遣国与接受国之间有效之特别协定所规定之使馆职务不相符合之用途。”这是一切驻外使馆、外交代表和其他享有外交特权与豁免的人员，在其行为和活动中必须严格遵守的国际法规则，也是对接受国应负的法律义务。美国既然也是参加该公约的当事国之一，理应负有严格遵守并接受该公约约束的义务和责任。令人奇怪的是，一贯自称所谓“法治国家”的美国，却允许其驻华使馆置《维也纳外交关系公约》于不顾，公然向被我公安机关通缉逮捕的方、李二犯敞开使馆大门，让其逃匿馆舍之内并加以庇护。国际法院在庇护案的判决中曾公正地指出，外交庇护包含着对该国主权的损害，它使罪犯不受当地国家的管辖，因而是对专属该国权限的事项的干涉。显然，美国驻华使馆庇护方、李二犯的行为，就是对我国主权的损害和侵犯，妄图使方、李二犯逃避我国的刑事管辖。这难道还能说不是对专属我国内政权限的公开干涉吗？
    再次，美国驻华使馆对方、李二犯的庇护行为，违背了指导中美关系的根本原则。众所周知，在著名的１９７２年上海公报中，中美“双方同意，各国不论社会制度如何，都应根据尊重各国主权和领土完整，不侵犯别国，不干涉别国内政，平等互利，和平共处的原则来处理国与国之间的关系。”“美国和中华人民共和国准备在他们的相互关系中实行这些原则”。１９７８年在中美建交公报中，又“重申上海公报中双方一致同意的各项原则”。在１９８２年的公报中，双方再次重申，“互相尊重主权和领土完整，互不干涉内政是指导中美关系的根本原则”。美国政府尽管左一个同意，又一个重申，而如今庇护方、李二犯的活生生的事实表明，美国政府并没有在行动上完全信守“无意侵犯中国主权”、“无意干涉中国内政”的保证。
    还应指出的是，互不干涉内政，决非仅是指导中美双边关系的一项原则，而是早已成为国际社会公认的处理各国在国际社会中相互关系的一项基本准则。比如，联合国大会于１９６５年和１９７０年，先后通过的《关于各国内政不容干涉及其独立与主权之保护宣言》和《关于各国依联合国宪章建立友好关系及合作之国际法原则之宣言》都规定，“任何国家，不论为任何理由，均无权直接或间接干涉任何其他国家之内政、外交”事务，各国负有“依照宪章不干涉任何国家国内管辖事项之义务。”然而，美国驻华使馆庇护方、李二犯，干涉我国内政的行为，不仅违反国际关系的基本准则，而且侵犯了中华人民共和国的主权。我们完全有理由要求美国驻华使馆停止这种干涉中华人民共和国内政的行为。
