Xinhua News Agency, Prague, June 15th. The Czech newspaper *Red Right* published on June 14th an article by its correspondent in Beijing. The article states that Chinese public opinion has been engaged in heated discussions about the causes and consequences of the recent turmoil. Deng Xiaoping's speech during his meeting with Chinese military leaders can serve as a starting point for analysis.

The article points out that what can be called the "Beijing Incident" is not yet over. It is too early to conduct a thorough and serious analysis of the various acts in this drama. In Beijing and other parts of China, many people are still not calm, and some are not making rational judgments but are driven by emotions. Regardless of how dramatic this event is, it is ultimately an internal affair of this country. China has the strength and wisdom to find a solution that is beneficial to social stability.

The article expresses disapproval of some Western propaganda tools and some countries' governments, which hastily gave advice to the People's Republic of China and made definitive conclusions after June 3rd and 4th. The article believes that this incident can only be evaluated by the Chinese people, the Chinese Communist Party, other political parties and social organizations, and the highest state organs.

The article states that since the imposition of martial law, the Chinese leadership has shown sufficient restraint and patience over the past two weeks. However, during this period, extremist groups began to set the tone for the demonstrations. Their political creed is no longer dissatisfaction with the speed of reform, inflation, or corruption, but a demand to overthrow the current leadership, political system, and to restore capitalism in China. The situation shows that labeling these demonstrations as harmless "patriotic movements" means creating harmful illusions. It is now clear that it is time to call things by their right names and to expose their anti-socialist background.

The article concludes by stating that the Chinese leadership has clearly indicated that the events in Beijing will not cause them to deviate from the path they have taken. The process of reform and opening up is irreversible.

Xinhua News Agency, Rangoon, June 15th. On June 13th, Secretary Khin Nyunt of the Myanmar State Law and Order Restoration Council met with the Chinese Ambassador to Myanmar, Cheng Ruisheng. Representing the Council Chairman, General Saw Maung, Khin Nyunt expressed understanding and sympathy for the Chinese government's stance in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots.

Khin Nyunt said that he himself was pleased to see the quick restoration of order in China's capital and other cities.

He said that Myanmar believes the Chinese government has the ability to overcome difficulties, restore order and the rule of law. The Myanmar government supports the Chinese government's stance against foreign interference.

Khin Nyunt also expressed the hope for further strengthening the relationship between Myanmar and China.

Chinese Ambassador to Myanmar, Cheng Ruisheng, expressed gratitude for the Myanmar government's stance.

　　捷党报评“北京事件”时指出
    邓小平讲话是分析问题出发点
    缅甸同情理解我政府立场
    新华社布拉格６月１５日电  捷克斯洛伐克《红色权利报》１４日刊登该报驻北京记者写的一篇述评说，中国舆论对不久前的骚乱产生的原因及其后果展开了热烈讨论。邓小平在接见中国军队将领时的讲话可以作为分析的出发点。
    述评指出，可称作“北京事件”的东西尚未完结，要对这场剧的各幕进行比较深入的思考和认真分析，时间显然太短。在北京及中国其它地方，许多头脑发热的人尚未冷静下来，一些人不是清醒地判断事实，而是感情占上风。这个事件不论如何戏剧化，它毕竟是这个国家的内部事务，它有足够的力量和智慧找到有利于中国社会稳定的解决办法。
    述评对某些西方宣传工具和某些国家政府在６月３日和４日后，慌忙对人民中国提出劝告，并断然做出结论的作法不以为然，述评认为，对这个事件只能由中国人民、中国共产党、其它政党和社会团体以及最高国家机关进行估价。
    述评说，中国领导从宣布戒严令以来的２周多时间内表现出了足够的克制和耐心。然而在这个时期，极端集团开始为示威活动定调，他们的政治信条已不是对改革的“速度”、通货膨胀或腐败现象不满，而是要求推翻中国现领导、政治制度和在中国恢复资本主义。情况表明，把这些示威称作没有危害的“爱国运动”，就意味着制造有害的幻想。极为明显，现在是该把事物称作它应有的名称和公开揭露其反社会主义背景的时候了。
    述评最后说，中国领导明确表示，北京发生的事件不会使他们离开已采取的路线，改革和开放的道路是不可逆转的进程。
    新华社仰光６月１５日电　缅甸国家治安建设委员会秘书钦纽６月１３日在召见中国驻缅甸大使程瑞声时，代表该委员会主席苏貌将军，对中国政府在平息反革命暴乱中采取的立场表示理解和同情。
    钦纽说，他本人对中国首都及其它城市的秩序很快恢复感到高兴。
    他说，缅甸相信中国政府有能力战胜困难，恢复秩序与法律。缅甸政府支持中国政府反对外来干涉的立场。
    钦纽还表示，希望进一步加强缅甸与中国的关系。
    中国驻缅甸大使程瑞声对缅甸政府的立场表示感谢。
