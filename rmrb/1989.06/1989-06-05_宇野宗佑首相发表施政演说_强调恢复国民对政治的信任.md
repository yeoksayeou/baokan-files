Prime Minister Uno Sōsuke today emphasized that restoring public trust in politics is the foundation for consolidating national peace and prosperity, and is an essential factor in restoring and strengthening the national image.

Uno made these remarks during his first policy speech to the joint session of both houses of the Diet.

Uno, who just formed a new cabinet last week, said in his policy speech that the essence of democracy lies in not betraying the public's trust and mandate, and in conducting honest and transparent politics. However, public trust in politics has been severely damaged at present.

Uno said, "I believe we should return to this starting point of democracy and promote politics that the public can accept and understand easily." This is the reason he decided to push forward with political reforms.

When discussing foreign policy, Uno said that the current international situation is facing the biggest turning point since the war, and Japan is also at a historic turning point. He expressed his intention to continue the foreign policy of his predecessors, maintaining relations with the United States as the axis while also fulfilling international obligations as a member of the Asia-Pacific region.

Uno also reaffirmed the security and defense policies of previous cabinets, stating that Japan will adhere to the Japan-U.S. security system, maintain the principles of exclusive defense, non-nuclear policy, and civilian control within the constitutional framework, and build defense forces in a restrained manner.

　　宇野宗佑首相发表施政演说
    强调恢复国民对政治的信任
    新华社东京６月５日电  （记者张可喜）日本新任首相宇野宗佑今天强调指出，恢复国民对政治的信任是巩固国家和平与繁荣的基础，也是恢复与加强国家形象所不可缺少的因素。
    宇野是在参众两院全体议员会议上首次发表施政演说时说这番话的。
    刚刚在上周组成了新内阁的宇野宗佑在施政演说中说，民主主义的根本就在于不辜负国民的信任和委托，推行诚实而透明的政治。但是，目前国民对政治的信任受到了很大损伤。
    宇野说，他“认为应该回到民主主义的这一出发点上来，以推行国民能够接受的、容易了解的政治”，这是他下决心推进政治改革的原因。
    在谈到外交政策时，宇野说，目前的国际形势正面临着战后的最大转折，日本也到了历史性的转折点。他表示将继续推行其前任的外交路线，一方面作为西方工业发达国家的成员，把同美国的关系作为轴心，一方面又作为亚太国家的一员，来履行国际义务。
    宇野在讲演中还重申了历届内阁的安全防务政策，即坚持日美安全体系，在宪法范围内，坚持专守防卫、无核三原则和文官统治的原则，有节制地建设防卫力量。
