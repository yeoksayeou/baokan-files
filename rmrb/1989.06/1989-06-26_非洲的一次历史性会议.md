History will forever remember June 22, 1989. That afternoon at 6:30 PM, a summit meeting of 20 African countries in Zaire President Mobutu's hometown of Badollet on the issue of Angolan peace had been going on for more than two hours. At this time, the leader of the Angolan rebel group UNITA, Savimbi, strode into the conference hall, not only participating in the meeting but also warmly shaking hands with Angolan President Dos Santos. The two sides, who had been fighting a 14-year civil war, finally shook hands and made peace, marking the formal beginning of Angola's national reconciliation process and indicating the complete success of this summit meeting.

The Badollet 20-nation summit is a continuation and expansion of the 8-nation summit held in Luanda on May 16. Its purpose is to seek ways and means for Angola to achieve lasting peace and national reconciliation. The joint statement issued by the meeting shows that this purpose has been achieved. According to the decisions made by the meeting and accepted by the opposing sides in Angola, the Angolan government and UNITA will cease hostile actions, and both sides will cease fire from 00:00 on June 24; UNITA members will be incorporated into all departments of the Angolan state apparatus; a committee composed of the Angolan government, UNITA, and other parties will be established to formulate the implementation procedures for the national reconciliation process under the mediation of Zaire President Mobutu. In addition, Savimbi announced that he would not participate in the transitional government he proposed for Angola and would not personally participate in negotiations with the Angolan authorities, which means there is an implicit agreement that Savimbi will retire for a period to facilitate the implementation of the national reconciliation process.

It is well known that since UNITA is a rebel group actively supported by South Africa and the United States, how to solve the UNITA problem is not only an internal affair of Angola but also involves the overall peace in southwestern Africa. Without solving this problem, Angola cannot achieve lasting peace, the withdrawal of Cuban troops from Angola, and the independence process of Namibia will all be affected. As early as last year's "four-party talks" between Angola, Cuba, the United States, and South Africa, attempts were made to solve this problem, but it was not solved. Although the four parties ultimately overcame this problem and reached the Brazzaville Agreement and signed the New York Accord, the UNITA problem has always been a hidden danger to the realization of peace in southwestern Africa. Now, some African heads of state have solved this problem in an African way. Thus, not only can Angola achieve true and lasting peace, but the independence process of Namibia can also be accelerated, and it will promote the realization of peace in the entire southern Africa; at the same time, it also provides another example for other African countries to solve the problem of civil war. As soon as the meeting ended, Mozambican President Chissano requested President Mobutu to act as a mediator to help Mozambique achieve national reconciliation and end the civil war. Therefore, the joint statement of the Badollet summit was widely welcomed by international public opinion as soon as it was published.

The success of the Badollet summit is not accidental. It is the result of the active efforts of African heads of state based on the achievements of the "four-party talks" and the mutual concessions of the Angolan government and UNITA in accordance with the historical trend and the will of the people. If the "four-party talks" agreement eliminated the external factors of the Angolan war, then the decisions announced by the Badollet summit eliminated the internal factors of the Angolan war. In this sense, the Badollet summit is a historically significant meeting in the peace process of Angola and southern Africa.

### 非洲的一次历史性会议

　　非洲的一次历史性会议
    新华社记者  刘上阳
    历史将永远记住１９８９年６月２２日这一天。当日下午６点半，２０个非洲国家在扎伊尔总统蒙博托的家乡巴多利特市就安哥拉和平问题举行的首脑会议已持续了两个多小时，这时，安哥拉反政府武装组织——安盟的领导人萨文比大步流星进入会议厅，不仅参加了会议，而且同安哥拉总统多斯桑托斯热烈握手。打了１４年内战的双方终于握手言和，标志安哥拉民族和解进程的正式开始，说明这次首脑会议取得了圆满成功。
    巴多利特２０国首脑会议是５月１６日罗安达８国首脑会议的续会和扩大会议，其目的是为安哥拉实现持久和平寻求安哥拉民族和解的途径和方法，会议发表的联合声明表明，这一目的已经达到。根据会议作出的并为安哥拉敌对双方所接受的决定，安哥拉政府和安盟之间停止敌对行动，双方从６月２４日零点起停火；安盟成员被纳入安哥拉国家机器的一切部门；成立一个由安哥拉政府、安盟和其他方面参加的委员会，负责在扎伊尔总统蒙博托的调解下制定民族和解进程的实施程序。此外，萨文比宣布，他将不参加他建议的安哥拉过渡政府，并且不亲自参加同安哥拉当局的谈判，这意味着还有萨文比隐退一段时期的默契，以利于民族和解进程的实施。
    众所周知，由于安盟是一个得到南非和美国积极支持的安哥拉反政府武装组织，如何解决安盟问题，既属于安哥拉的内政，又牵涉到西南部非洲实现和平的全局。这一问题不解决，安哥拉就不可能实现持久和平，古巴从安撤军和纳米比亚的独立进程都会受到影响。早在去年的安、古、美和南非的“四方会谈”中就试图解决这一问题，但没能解决，四方虽然最终越过这一问题而达成了布拉柴维尔议定书和签署了纽约协定，但安盟问题始终是实现西南部非洲和平的一个隐患。如今，一些非洲国家元首以非洲方式解决了这一问题。这样，不仅安哥拉可以实现真正持久的和平，纳米比亚的独立进程可以加快，并将促进整个南部非洲和平的实现；同时，这也为其他非洲国家解决内战问题提供了又一范例。会议一结束，莫桑比克总统希萨诺就要求蒙博托总统作调解人，帮助莫桑比克实现民族和解，结束内战。因此巴多利特首脑会议的联合声明一公布，就受到了国际舆论的普遍欢迎。
    巴多利特首脑会议的成功并非偶然，它是在“四方会谈”成果的基础上，非洲国家元首们自己积极努力的结果，也是安哥拉政府和安盟顺应历史潮流和民心而相互妥协让步的结果。如果说“四方会谈”达成的协议消除了安哥拉战乱的外部因素，那么，巴多利特首脑会议宣布的决定则消除了安哥拉战乱的内部因素，从这种意义上讲，巴多利特首脑会议是安哥拉和南部非洲和平进程中具有历史意义的会议。
