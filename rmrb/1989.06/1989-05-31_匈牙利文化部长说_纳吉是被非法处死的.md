Hungarian Culture Minister Says
Nagi Was Illegally Executed

	Xinhua News Agency, Budapest, May 30: The newly appointed Hungarian Culture Minister, Gloz Ferenc, stated that the former Prime Minister, Nagi Imre, was "illegally sentenced to death."

	Gloz was appointed as the Culture Minister on May 10. The Hungarian News reported on May 30 that during his visit to the southwestern city of Kaposvar on May 29, Gloz made the above statement.

	Gloz said, "From Nagi's articles and speeches, it can be seen that he is a great figure in our country's history and a theorist of the international labor movement, a Marxist and a communist." Gloz pointed out that the basic principles Nagi established regarding legal systems, the relationships between socialist countries, and the necessity of social democratization were later reflected in the country's reform efforts, even though his name was no longer mentioned.

	Gloz is a historian and was the director of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences' History Research Institute before taking on the role of Culture Minister. His speech suggests that the official evaluation of Nagi is about to undergo a significant change.

　　匈牙利文化部长说
    纳吉是被非法处死的
    新华社布达佩斯５月３０日电  匈牙利新任文化部长格洛兹·费伦茨说，前政府总理纳吉·伊姆雷是被“非法判处死刑”的。
    格洛兹是本月１０日被任命为文化部长的。《匈牙利新闻报》３０日刊登了他在２９日访问西南部城市考波什瓦尔时发表的讲话。
    格洛兹说，“从纳吉的文章和讲话看，他是我国历史上的伟人和国际工人运动的理论家，是马克思主义者和共产主义者”。格洛兹指出，纳吉所确定的那些关于法制、社会主义各国之间的关系和社会民主化的必要性的基本原则，后来都体现在国家的改革努力之中，尽管人们不再提他的名字。
    格洛兹是位历史学家，出任文化部长前是匈牙利科学院历史研究所所长。他的这一讲话预示着官方对纳吉的评价即将发生惊人的变化。
