In mid-March, we conducted a survey of the status of rural party members throughout the county and found that the rural party member ranks are seriously aging. Taking Baita Township as an example, this township has 596 party members, among whom only 75 are young party members under the age of 35, accounting for 12.42% of the total number of party members in this township. In Mingfeng Village, half of the 12 party members are between 60 and 64 years old.

The reasons for the aging of the rural party member ranks are as follows:

First, the work of developing party members in rural party branches is generally slow. In recent years, party committees at all levels have focused on developing party members in enterprises and institutions, neglecting the development of young party members on the agricultural frontline. Last year, Baita Township developed 7 party members, with 5 from township and village enterprises and institutions and only 2 from rural areas. Lianhu Village in this township has not developed any party members for 14 years. This has made the problem of party member aging increasingly serious.

Second, although rural youth are eager to advance, few approach the party organization. According to the survey, those with some ability tend to join township and village enterprises or go out to do business or work as laborers. Currently, only some non-party village cadres write applications to join the party, and ordinary young people almost never write applications to join the party.

Third, ideological and political work has been relaxed.

### 金坛县农村党员队伍趋于老化

　　金坛县农村党员队伍趋于老化
    ３月中旬，我们对全县农村党员的状况进行了一次调查，发现农村党员队伍严重老化。以白塔乡为例，这个乡共有党员５９６人，其中３５岁以下的年轻党员只有７５人，占这个乡党员总数的１２．４２％。鸣凤村支部有党员１２人，其中６０岁至６４岁的党员竟占了一半。
    造成农村党员队伍老化的原因有：
    一是农村党支部发展党员工作普遍缓慢。近几年，各级党委把发展党员工作重点放在企事业单位，忽视了在农业第一线中发展青年党员。白塔乡去年发展７名党员，集镇企事业单位发展５人，农村只有２人。这个乡的联湖村已１４年没有发展党员。这就使党员“老化”问题越来越严重。
    二是农村青年虽求上进，但向党组织靠拢的少。从调查的情况看，稍有能耐的青年，都进了乡、村企业或出外做生意、当工人。现在，只是有一些非党员村干部写入党申请，一般青年几乎都不愿写入党申请。
    三是放松了思想政治工作。
