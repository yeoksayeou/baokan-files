Ryzhkov Speaks on the Formation of the New Government
	Three Characteristics of the New Government
	Fewer Ministries, More Experts, Average Age 55

	Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 10 (Reporter Zhu Chengjun) The Supreme Soviet of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the Nationalities Council held a joint meeting today to hear the report by the newly appointed Chairman of the Council of Ministers of the USSR, Ryzhkov, on the formation of the new government.

	Ryzhkov first emphasized that the composition of the new government must consider five key tasks: meeting the needs of the Soviet people; developing the economy under new guidelines; abandoning administrative command methods; diversifying and equalizing ownership forms; and fully tapping the creative potential of the socialist alliance system.

	He believes that it is necessary to further change the structure, functions, style, and methods of operation of the government and state management organs, abolish various overlapping institutions that may hinder the work of grassroots production units, and delegate more economic powers to the union republics and local authorities.

	Ryzhkov pointed out that the new government consists of 3 first deputy chairmen of the Council of Ministers, 10 deputy chairmen, and 57 ministries. The new government has three characteristics: first, the number of ministries has been reduced by 25 compared to before, with 20 fewer industrial management departments; second, experts have been further increased, including 6 academicians and corresponding members of the Academy of Sciences, with Vice President of the Academy of Sciences Lavrov and academician Abalkin nominated to serve as deputy chairmen of the Council of Ministers; third, "youthification," with the average age of government members being 55 years old.

	He said that if his cabinet plan is approved, two-thirds of the new members will enter the cabinet, and government administrative personnel will be reduced by 30%. In addition, he proposed the establishment of the State Economic Reform Commission and the State Emergency Committee, the latter's main task being to handle sudden disasters.

	According to reports, Chairman of the State Planning Commission Maslyukov, Foreign Minister Shevardnadze, Minister of Defense Yazov, and KGB Chairman Kryuchkov are proposed to remain in their original positions. According to the schedule, starting on the 19th, some committees of the two chambers of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR will separately discuss the relevant lists of the government composition, and on the 26th, the two chambers will hold a joint meeting to finally approve the new government list.

	The two chambers also elected vice-chairmen and chairmen of some committees today. Former leader of the Moscow Party organization, Yeltsin, was elected chairman of the Construction and Architecture Commission.

　　雷日科夫谈新政府组成
    新政府的三个特点
    部委数目减少　专家有所增加　平均年龄５５岁
    新华社莫斯科６月１０日电  （记者竺承军）苏联最高苏维埃联盟院和民族院今天举行联席会议，听取新任苏联部长会议主席雷日科夫关于新政府组成的报告。
    雷日科夫首先强调，新政府的组成必须考虑５项关键性任务，即：满足苏联人民的需求；在新的方针指导下发展经济；摒弃行政命令的管理方法；所有制形式要多样化和一律平等；充分挖掘社会主义联盟制的创造潜力。
    他认为，必须进一步改变政府和国家管理机关的结构、职能、作风和活动方式，撤销那些可能有碍基层生产单位工作的各种重叠机构，把更多的经济权力下放给加盟共和国和地方。
    雷日科夫指出，新政府设３名部长会议第一副主席，１０名副主席和５７个部委。新政府的组成有３个特点：一是部委数目较前削减２５个，其中工业管理部门减少２０个；二是专家进一步增加，其中６人是科学院院士和通讯院士，科学院副院长拉韦罗夫和院士阿巴尔金被提名担任部长会议副主席；三是“年轻化”，政府成员的平均年龄为５５岁。
    他说，如果他的组阁计划被批准，将有２／３的新人入阁，政府行政人员将削减３０％。此外，他还提议成立国家经济改革委员会和国家非常局势委员会，后者任务主要是处理突发性的灾祸。
    据报道，国家计委主席马斯柳科夫、外长谢瓦尔德纳泽、国防部长亚佐夫和克格勃主席克留奇科夫被提议留任原职。根据日程安排，１９日开始，苏联最高苏维埃两院的一些委员会将分别讨论政府组成的有关名单，２６日两院举行联席会议，最终批准新政府名单。
    两院今天还选举了副主席和一些委员会的主席。前莫斯科党组织领导人叶利钦担任建设和建筑艺术委员会主席。
