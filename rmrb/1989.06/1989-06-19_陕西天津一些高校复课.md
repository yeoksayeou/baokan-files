Some universities in Shaanxi and Tianjin have resumed classes. According to a report from our correspondent Meng Xian'an in Xi'an on June 18, in recent days, 30 colleges and universities in Shaanxi Province have resumed classes one after another. On the afternoon of the 17th, Provincial Party Secretary Zhang Boxing and Governor Hou Zongbin, along with other leaders, visited Xi'an Jiaotong University, Northwestern Polytechnical University, and Xi'an Institute of Physical Education to visit teachers and staff who have been working and studying, as well as young students.

Zhang Boxing and Hou Zongbin praised the teachers and staff of these three universities for standing firm at their posts under extremely complex and difficult conditions, fulfilling their duties as educators, and doing a great deal of persuasion and ideological and political work for the students. Zhang Boxing said, "True strength is revealed in adversity." In this struggle concerning the fate and future of the Party and the country, every comrade must face a stern test.

Statistics from the Provincial Education Department show that out of the 49 colleges and universities in Shaanxi Province, the 30 that have resumed classes are mainly provincial, municipal, and prefecture-level institutions. The 19 institutions under the State Education Commission and ministries have mostly taken early vacations, and the resumption rate is relatively low. Therefore, Governor Hou Zongbin hopes that students who have not returned from outside or have taken early vacations will dispel their concerns and return to school as soon as possible or in advance to make up for lost time and resume their studies. He requires teachers and parents to do a good job of educating and persuading the students.

According to a report from our correspondent in Tianjin on June 19, most of the municipal colleges and universities in Tianjin have resumed classes, and graduating students can graduate on schedule. The Foreign Language Institute, Medical College, Traditional Chinese Medicine College, Music College, Urban Construction College, and Vocational University have student attendance rates close to 100%. Today, Hebei Institute of Technology, Finance and Economics Institute, and other schools have student attendance rates of over 90%, with students from outside the province gradually returning to school. Hebei Institute of Technology, Civil Aviation Institute, and others have decided to postpone their vacations to make up for the previous academic losses.

　　陕西天津一些高校复课
    本报西安６月１８日电  记者孟西安报道：近日内，陕西省已有３０所高等院校陆续复课。１７日下午，省委书记张勃兴、省长侯宗宾等领导前往西安交通大学、西北工业大学和西安体育学院，看望坚持工作学习的教职员工和青年学生。
    张勃兴、侯宗宾一行赞扬这３所院校的教职工，在极其复杂、困难的条件下，坚守岗位，恪守教师职责，苦口婆心地对广大学生做了大量劝导和思想政治工作。张勃兴说：“疾风知劲草”，在这场关系到党和国家命运前途的斗争中，我们每个同志都要经受严峻的考验。
    省高教局提供的数字表明，在陕西省４９所高等院校中，已复课的３０所高校主要是省、地、市属院校，１９所国家教委和部属院校大都已提前放假，复课率较低。为此，省长侯宗宾希望外出未归或提前放假回家的学生要解除思想顾虑，尽快或提前回校复课，把丢失的时间夺回来，把荒废的学业补上，他要求教师和家长做好对学生的教育和劝导工作。
    本报天津６月１９日电　天津市属各高校大多数已复课，毕业班学生可如期毕业。外语学院、医学院、中医学院、音乐学院、城建学院、职业大学等校，学生出勤率已接近１００％。今天复课的河北工学院、财经学院等学生出勤均达９０％以上，外地学生正陆续返校。河北工学院、民航学院等还决定延期放假，以弥补前一段学业损失。
