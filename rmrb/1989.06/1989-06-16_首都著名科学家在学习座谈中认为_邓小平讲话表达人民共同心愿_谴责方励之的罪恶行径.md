Prominent scientists in the capital, during a study session, believe that Deng Xiaoping's speech expresses the common aspirations of the people and condemn Fang Lizhi's criminal actions.

Beijing, June 16 (Xinhua) — Reporter Wang Yougong: The Chinese Association for Science and Technology today organized a group of prominent scientists and relevant personnel in Beijing, including Qian Xuesen, Qian Sanqiang, Wang Dahan, Zhu Guangya, Tang Aoqing, Qiu Weifan, Wu Jiaoping, Zhang Wei, Zhuang Fenggan, and Gao Zhenning, to study and discuss Deng Xiaoping's important speech during his reception of senior military officers of the capital's martial law troops. The attendees believed that this speech deeply pointed out the causes and essence of this counter-revolutionary riot, indicated the direction for the country's future reforms and construction, and fully expressed the aspirations of China's more than 9 million science and technology workers.

The attendees highly agreed with Deng Xiaoping's opinion that the achievements of the ten years of reform and opening up should be fully affirmed. They believed that socialism should represent advanced productive forces and advanced production relations and must advance through reform and opening up. Today's world is an open and information-based world, and reform and opening up should be our general policy. After the founding of the nation, due to foreign embargoes and blockades and the influence of "leftist" ideologies, we continued to suffer from the bitter consequences of the closed-door policy that had been in place for a century and a half since the Opium War. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, China's socialist modernization construction has achieved significant results in ten years of reform and opening up. Now, the global scientific and technological revolution is rapidly developing, and we need to better promote the policy of reform and opening up. These scientists firmly believe that after this turmoil, the coordination and promotion of adhering to the four cardinal principles and adhering to reform and opening up will definitely be better, the Party and the government will definitely be more mature and strong in leading reforms and construction, and our steps in reform and opening up will definitely be more stable and faster.

The attendees hope that after the complete suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot, the Party and the government can summarize experiences, draw lessons, better listen to the opinions of people from all walks of life in major national decisions, establish dialogue channels, improve democracy and the legal system, eliminate corruption, and mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of the people to the greatest extent, so that the work can be done better.

The attendees also condemned Fang Lizhi's treasonous actions in their speeches. Many attendees pointed out that Fang Lizhi's thoughts are reactionary, and he even claimed to import a "prime minister" from abroad. During the turmoil in Beijing and the counter-revolutionary riot, he and his wife Li Shuxian had close ties with some leaders of the "High Autonomy Alliance." After the failure of the counter-revolutionary riot, they fled to the U.S. Embassy seeking protection, fully exposing the reactionary face of traitors. The attending scientists suggested that the Chinese Society for Dialectics of Nature should remove him from his position as vice-president and expel him from the society.

　　首都著名科学家在学习座谈中认为
    邓小平讲话表达人民共同心愿
    谴责方励之的罪恶行径
    本报北京６月１６日讯  记者王友恭报道：中国科协今天组织部分在京著名科学家与有关人士钱学森、钱三强、王大珩、朱光亚、唐敖庆、裘维藩、吴阶平、张维、庄逢甘、高镇宁等，学习、座谈邓小平同志在接见首都戒严部队军以上干部时的重要讲话。与会同志认为，这一讲话深刻指明了这场反革命暴乱发生的原因和实质，指明了今后国家改革和建设的前进方向，完全表达了我国９００多万科技工作者的心愿。
    与会同志非常赞同邓小平同志提出的对十年改革开放的成绩要充分估计够的意见。他们认为，社会主义应当代表发达的生产力和先进的生产关系，必然是在改革和开放中前进的社会。当今的世界是开放的信息化的世界，改革开放应当是我们的总方针。建国以后的一段时间里，由于外国禁运封锁和主观指导思想上“左”的影响，使我们继续承受了鸦片战争一个半世纪以来实行闭关锁国政策的苦头。党的十一届三中全会以来，我国的社会主义现代化建设在十年改革开放中取得了重大的成果。现在，全球性的科学技术革命浪潮正在迅猛发展，需要我们更好地推进改革开放的政策。这些科学家坚信，经过这场风波、坚持四项基本原则与坚持改革开放这两个基本点一定能够更好地协调和促进，党和政府在领导改革和建设上一定会更加成熟和坚强，我们的改革开放的步子将一定迈得更稳、更快。
    与会同志希望在彻底平息反革命暴乱之后，党和政府能够很好地总结经验，吸取教训，在国家各种重大决策上更好地听取各阶层人民的意见，建立对话渠道，健全民主与法制，消除腐败现象，把广大人民群众的积极性最大限度地调动起来，把工作做得更好。
    与会者在发言中还谴责了方励之的卖国行径。许多同志指出，方励之思想反动，竟然扬言要从国外引进“总理”。在这次北京发生动乱直至反革命暴乱的过程中，他和妻子李淑娴与“高自联”的某些头头联系密切。反革命暴乱失败之后，他们夫妇一头扎进美国大使馆谋求保护，彻底暴露了卖国贼的反动嘴脸。与会科学家建议中国自然辩证法研究会罢免他在该会中担任的副理事长职务，并开除他的会籍。
