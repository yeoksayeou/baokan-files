The cicadas singing under the mountain locust trees reflected General Ding's mood. What could be more joyous than having his grandson return from the military to celebrate his birthday?

General Ding and his granddaughter Yurong had been busy since early morning, cleaning the house inside and out, as if preparing to welcome a distinguished guest.

For General Ding, his grandson's return from the military was even more important than welcoming a distinguished guest. Fifty years ago, on this very day, he had rescued a baby wrapped in swaddling clothes from the enemy's gunfire. This child later became General Ding's son. The general had sent his son into the military, where he grew from a soldier to an officer. Unfortunately, after liberation, he sacrificed his life in a battle to defend the motherland. His son left behind a son and a daughter. When the grandson was 18, the general sent him into the military as well. Now, the grandson had become a platoon leader and was about to return home to celebrate his 24th birthday. How could the old man not be overjoyed?

The sun had risen to its zenith. The general had personally prepared various delicacies for his grandson, which were now arranged on the dining table. At this moment, Yurong was carefully inserting red candles into the large cake in the center. She thought, as soon as my brother comes in, I'll light it, and he'll definitely be happy. She lowered her head, mimicking her mother's mannerisms from when she was alive, planting two strings of suppressed sadness and excitement onto his green military uniform.

Footsteps echoed outside the door. The general was about to go out when he collided with Chen, the deputy mayor, who was entering.

"This is General Ding Keishan, the grandfather of Comrade Ding Aiguo!" Chen introduced to the military officer following him, his voice heavy.

The general, seeing the visitors' expressions, seemed to sense something amiss!

"I am the political instructor of the platoon where Ding Aiguo served." The military officer introduced himself and continued, "Comrade Ding Aiguo was seriously injured while suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing. Despite efforts to save him, he sacrificed his life for the country..."

Ah! A bolt of lightning struck from a clear sky, nearly shattering the general's soul into pieces. Yurong burst into tears, and everyone's hearts felt as heavy as lead.

"This is Ding Aiguo's personal effects." The political instructor handed a small package to the general.

The general's hands trembled as he opened the package. On top of the personal effects lay an unsealed letter. This was a letter that Aiguo had dictated after being injured but had not been able to send.

"Grandpa: First, I apologize for not being able to return. The day after I wrote to you, our unit was deployed to Beijing for martial law duties, and it seems it will take some time. Currently, our platoon is engaged in a bloody struggle. In this time of national crisis, Grandpa, I believe you will understand the feelings of a Chinese soldier who is as passionate as you were in your youth. If I sacrifice myself, Grandpa, please comfort my sister. She needs your nurturing by your side!

Grandpa, there is one more thing I need your help with. In May, a dormitory in ×× University caught fire, and three students lost all their belongings. Upon hearing this news, I sent them my half-year's allowance. This way, I am short of party dues for two months. If I sacrifice myself, Grandpa, please make sure to pay them on my behalf..."

The general, having read this far, was no longer sad. He seemed to have understood something. He went into the inner room, took out a stack of ten-yuan bills, and handed them to the political instructor.

"No, General! I have already paid Ding Aiguo's party dues."

"No, Comrade! This is my wish for your unit. You must accept it!"

"This..."

"Accept it, you cannot refuse General Ding's wish!" Deputy Mayor Chen said, turning his face towards the old general, "Comrade Keishan, if you have any requests, just tell me!"

"I have no requests. Come," the general pointed to the cake on the table with candles inserted, "Today is Aiguo's 26th birthday. You all accompany me and Yurong to celebrate it for Aiguo!"

"General!" The political instructor could no longer hold back the tears welling in his eyes. He tightly grasped the general's hand, sobbing, "I and Aiguo were like brothers. If you, old man, do not mind, please treat me as Aiguo in the future!"

"Brother—!" Just as the general silently nodded his head, Yurong suddenly rushed towards the political instructor, emitting a warm cry.

The 26 red candles were lit, their bright flames flickering with golden light, blooming the eternal flowers of the Chinese nation...

　　生日（小说）
    赵秀杰
    山槐树筛下的蝉歌，是丁将军此时的心情。有什么能比孙子要从部队回来探亲和过生日更喜的事呢？
    将军和孙女育红，一大早就忙开了，把屋里屋外收拾得干干净净，像迎接贵宾似的。
    对于将军来说，孙子爱国的归来，比贵宾临门还重要。五十年前的今日，他从敌人的枪声里，捡回一个裹着襁褓的生命。这孩子后来就成了丁将军的儿子。将军把儿子送进部队，儿子由战士成长为干部，可惜解放后在一次保卫祖国的战斗中牺牲了。儿子留下一儿一女。当孙子１８岁时，将军又把孙子送进了部队。如今孙子已当上连长，就要回家过他的２４岁生日了，老人怎能不高兴！
    太阳升上中天了，将军为孙子亲手制做的各种美味已摆在餐桌上。这时育红正在向中间的那盒大蛋糕上小心翼翼地插着红蜡烛。她想，哥哥一进门，我就把它点着，他一定很高兴。她低着头，学着妈妈生前的样子，把两串忍不住的委屈和激动，种植在他草绿色的军装上。
    门外响起了脚步声，将军正待出门，和已经进来的陈副市长撞了个满怀。
    “这就是丁爱国同志的祖父丁凯山将军！”陈副市长向跟在身后的一位军人介绍道，声音显得很沉。
    将军一看来者的神情，似乎预感到什么了！
    “我是丁连长所在连队的指导员。”那位军人自我介绍后接着说：“爱国同志在平息北京反革命暴乱的斗争中，身负重伤，经过抢救无效，为国捐躯了……”
    啊！一个晴天霹雳凌空而降，几乎把将军的灵魂轰得四分五裂。育红“哇”地一下哭出声来，每个人的心情都铅般的沉重。
    “这是丁连长的遗物。”指导员把一个小包交给将军。
    将军双手颤抖地打开包一看，遗物的上面平放着一封未封口的信。这是爱国负伤后请人代写的一封未能发出的信。
    “爷爷：首先向您道歉的是，我不能回去了，因为在我给您去信的第二天，我们部队就被调往北京执行戒严任务了，估计时间不会短。时下，我们连正投入一场血与火的斗争中。在国难当头之际，爷爷，我想您会能理解和您当年一样血气方刚的中国军人的心情的。假如我牺牲的话，爷爷，您要多劝劝妹妹，要她坚强些，她在您身边，还需要您的心血浇灌呀！爷爷，我和育红会永久感谢您的。
    “爷爷，还有一事需您帮忙。今年５月，××大学的一个男生宿舍遭火灾，三位同学的东西不幸烧光了，知道这个消息后，我把半年的津贴寄给他们了。这样，我还差两个月的党费没有交，如果我牺牲的话，爷爷，请您一定替我转交上……”
    将军看到这里，已不再悲伤了，他似乎明白了什么。他走进里屋，拿出一叠面值为拾元的人民币，递到指导员的手上。
    “别，将军！丁连长的党费，我已替他交上了。”
    “不，指导员！这是我给你们部队的一份心愿，你一定得收下！”
    “这……”
    “收下吧，丁将军的心愿你是不能拒绝的！”陈副市长一边说，一边把脸转向老将军：“凯山同志，您有什么要求就跟我说吧！”
    “我什么要求也没有，来！”将军一指桌上插满红蜡烛的蛋糕说：“今天是爱国２６岁的生日，你们就陪我和育红替爱国庆祝一番吧！”
    “将军！”指导员再也忍不住噙在眼角的泪水了，他紧紧抓住将军的手，声泪俱下地说，“我和爱国朝夕相伴，如同亲兄弟，您老人家若不嫌弃的话，以后就把我当爱国吧！”
    “哥哥——！”就在将军默默把头一点的时候，育红突然扑向指导员，发出一声亲切的呼喊。
    ２６支红蜡烛点燃起来了，那明亮的光焰，闪烁着金色的光亮，盛开出中华民族永不凋谢的花朵……
