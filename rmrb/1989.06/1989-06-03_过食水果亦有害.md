Almost all fruits have medicinal and health benefits, and regular, moderate consumption is beneficial for health. However, consuming too much fruit can also be detrimental to health.

Pears are cold in nature, and excessive consumption can damage the spleen and stomach. They are not suitable for postpartum women, those with weak constitutions, poor digestion, chronic diarrhea, and abdominal cold pain.

Oranges are cool in nature, and those with spleen and kidney deficiency and coldness should avoid eating too many, as it can lead to abdominal pain, lumbago, or phlegm.

Bananas contain a substance called "5-hydroxytryptamine," and excessive consumption can cause digestive disorders. This is especially true for children, who should avoid overeating bananas.

Persimmons are cold in nature and are not suitable for postpartum women and those with weak constitutions. Healthy individuals should avoid eating large quantities of persimmons on an empty stomach, as the tannins, pectin, and stomach acid in persimmons can form persimmon stones in the stomach. Additionally, eating persimmons immediately after consuming protein-rich crabs can cause stone formation and intestinal obstruction.

Grapes are warm in nature and slippery in texture, and excessive consumption can lead to internal heat and diarrhea.

Apples are rich in the mineral potassium, and excessive consumption can damage the kidneys.

Red dates are sweet and warm in nature, and excessive consumption can generate phlegm, increase heat, and damage teeth. Those with stomach distension, excessive dampness and heat, and children with malnutrition should avoid consuming them.

Pineapples contain protease, and soaking them in salt water before consumption can break down the protease and prevent allergic reactions. Those with stomach ulcers, kidney disease, and blood clotting disorders should avoid consuming pineapples.

Lychees are sweet and delicious, but the lychee pits contain a substance called 2-methylcyclopropyl glycine, which can cause blood sugar to drop. Excessive consumption can lead to hypoglycemic syncope, known medically as "lychee disease."

Peaches are sweet and warm in nature, and excessive consumption can generate heat and lead to boils and other ailments.

    过食水果亦有害
    几乎所有的水果都具有医疗保健作用，经常性地适量食用对身体健康大有益处。但水果吃得过多也会损害健康。
    梨属寒品，多食则损伤脾胃，对于产妇、体质瘦弱、消化不良、慢性腹泻和腹冷痛时，均不宜食用。
    柑桔性凉，脾肾虚寒者多吃会导致腹痛、腰酸或寒痰。
    香蕉中含有一种“5—羟色胺”的物质，食用过多可引起胃肠功能紊乱。尤其对于儿童来说，更不宜贪食。
    柿子性寒，产后和体弱者不宜食用。健康者若空腹时大量吃柿子，因柿子中含有丹宁、果胶与胃酸，未被消化的纤维遇到一起，在胃里形成柿结石；刚吃过蛋白质丰富的螃蟹后，不宜立即吃柿子，以防出现结石造成消化道梗阻。
    葡萄性温、质滑，食用过量易产生内热、腹泻等症。
    苹果含矿物质钾丰富，多食用会损害肾脏。
    红枣为甘温之品，多食则生痰，助热损齿。凡胃脘胀满、湿盛痰热、小儿疳疾等，均不宜食用。
    菠萝含有蛋白酶，食用前可用盐水浸泡以破坏蛋白酶，避免引起过敏反应。凡患有胃溃疡、肾脏病和血液凝血机能不全者，均不食用为好。
    荔枝为甘美佳果，但由于荔枝核中含有一种2—次甲基丙环基甘氨酸的物质，可发血糖下降。食用过多后便可产生中毒性血糖降低性昏厥，即医学上称为“荔枝病”。
    桃子性甘温，多食生热，尚可引起痈疮等病症。
