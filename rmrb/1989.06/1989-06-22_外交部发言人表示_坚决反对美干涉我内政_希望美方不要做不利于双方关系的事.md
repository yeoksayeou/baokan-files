Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Expresses Strong Opposition to U.S. Interference in China's Internal Affairs

Hopes U.S. Will Not Do Things Harmful to Bilateral Relations

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 22—The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson said today that the Chinese government strongly opposes the U.S. government's interference in China's internal affairs and exerting pressure on China.

Spokesperson Li Jinhua made the above remarks at a press conference in response to a question from an Associated Press reporter regarding the U.S. announcement of suspending high-level contacts with China.

Li Jinhua also said in response to this question that the Chinese side hopes to maintain and develop Sino-U.S. relations, but this requires mutual respect and deeper understanding from both sides. Neither side should do things that harm bilateral relations.

She said: "We believe that only by adhering to the three Sino-U.S. joint communiqués and the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence can Sino-U.S. relations continue to develop."

Li Jinhua said that the recent suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot by the Chinese government was to restore social order and stability, ensure the safety of the country and the people, and enable economic construction and reform and opening-up to proceed smoothly. This is China's internal affair, and no foreign country should interfere.

She said that if foreigners cannot see clearly what is happening in China at the moment, they can observe more, adopt a calm and cautious attitude, and not rush to conclusions. She pointed out that some countries want to exert pressure on China through political or economic means, which is unwise and futile.

Li Jinhua said: "The Chinese people never yield to external pressure. We hope they can look further ahead, from the perspective of maintaining the overall situation of bilateral relations, not do things that hurt the feelings of the Chinese people, and not do things that are harmful to bilateral relations."

She reiterated: China's policy of reform and opening-up will not change, and China's independent and peaceful foreign policy will not change.

When a foreign reporter asked her to provide evidence to prove that some foreigners supported the recent riots in Beijing, Li Jinhua said: "There are indeed foreign forces and external forces that have had close contact with illegal organizations in Beijing during the counter-revolutionary riot, inciting and instigating, and even providing various forms of support."

　　外交部发言人表示    
    坚决反对美干涉我内政     
    希望美方不要做不利于双方关系的事
    新华社北京６月２２日电  中国外交部发言人今天在这里说，中国政府坚决反对美国政府干涉中国内政、对中国施加压力。
    发言人李金华是在新闻发布会上回答美联社记者有关美国宣布中止同中国高级官员的接触的问题时作上述表示的。
    李金华在回答这一问题时还说，中国方面希望保持和发展中美关系，但这需要双方互相尊重，加深理解。任何一方都不应该做损害两国关系的事情。
    她说：“我们认为，只有遵循中美之间的三个联合公报以及和平共处五项原则，中美关系才能继续得到发展。”
    李金华说，中国政府最近平息反革命暴乱，是为了恢复社会秩序的稳定，保障国家和人民的安全，使经济建设和改革开放得以顺利进行。这是中国的内政，任何外国都不应该干涉。
    她说，外国人对中国当前发生的事情如果一时看不清楚，可以多作一些观察，采取冷静和慎重的态度，不要匆忙做出结论。她指出，有的国家想用政治或经济手段向中国施加压力，这是不明智的，也是徒劳的。
    李金华说：“中国人民从不屈服于外来压力。我们希望他们把眼光放远一些，从维护双方关系的大局出发，不要做伤害中国人民感情的事情，也不要做不利于双方关系的事情。”
    她重申：中国的改革开放政策不会改变，中国独立自主的和平外交政策也不会改变。
    当一名外国记者要求她提供证据，证实有些外国人支持最近在北京所发生的暴乱时，李金华说：“确实有外国势力和外来势力，在北京的反革命暴乱中同国内的非法组织进行密切接触，进行煽动和挑唆，乃至向他们提供各种支持。”
