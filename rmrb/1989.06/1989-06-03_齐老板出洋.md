Mr. Qi, the director of the Foreign Trade Bureau, was known as Mr. Qi the Boss.

Mr. Qi's original name was Qi Zheng, given to him by his parents with great care. Their intention was not extravagant; they simply hoped that their son would grow up to be successful, upright, and not crooked. The two elders had good intentions, but they did not know their son's grand ambition: to be a person, one must strive to be upright and complete, which is too easy and too insignificant. He wanted to be Sun Wukong, the Great Sage Equal of Heaven. Later, he took the initiative to abolish the name given by his parents and changed it to Qi Tian.

Mr. Qi's career was smooth, progressing every year from clerk to section chief; from section chief to deputy director; from deputy director to director. Recently, he was selected and recommended to serve as a commercial representative in a relatively developed country along the Adriatic Sea. Going abroad to take up his post, his position was prominent, bringing glory to his ancestors, and making others envious. It seemed that he was truly becoming the Great Sage Equal of Heaven.

Before his departure, a close friend came to see him off and took the opportunity to ask him for advice on career advancement. Mr. Qi led his friend to a private room for a confidential conversation: "It looks complicated, but it's simple. As long as you can distinguish and properly position the gold, silver, and bronze medals in the future, you are guaranteed to rise step by step."

Gold, silver, and bronze medals are not the competition awards in sports, right? This isn't about running, swimming, or playing volleyball, so what necessary connection does it have with rising or not rising? The friend was puzzled, blinking his small eyes in confusion as he continued to seek enlightenment.

"This is called borrowing," Qi Tian saw that his friend's mind was too rigid and had to explain in detail, "Nowadays, if a person wants to be promoted continuously, they need to meet three conditions: education, age, and connections. You say, which of these is the most crucial? In my opinion, connections are the gold medal, age is the silver medal, and as for education, it can only be considered a stinking bronze medal."

The friend suddenly understood, but was also astonished.

"You think my secret is not effective?" Mr. Qi saw that his friend's reaction was really too slow, and further explained with personal examples to prove his theory of advancement: "First, let's talk about myself. Education, I didn't even finish high school; age, I will be sixty in half a year. How did I get promoted so quickly, and recently was even appointed to go abroad to take up my post? In a word, I firmly grasped the gold medal of connections. Also, look at my left and right hands, you are familiar with them. One is called Yang Huo, with a cultural level of literacy, known as the production brigade leader; the other is called Jiao Liu, who indeed has an education, but is just like me, in the field of foreign trade, to put it bluntly—he knows nothing. But how did they manage to be second only to the director in the Foreign Trade Bureau? The secret behind this, do I need to point it out for you?"

The friend felt as if he had been enlightened, and his mind was suddenly clear. He raised his cup to toast Mr. Qi, but in his heart, he secretly worried about his overseas assignment: "Your theory of gold, silver, and bronze medals may not work this time."

Sure enough, as the friend predicted, Mr. Qi went to the relatively developed country along the Adriatic Sea to take up his post, but in just three months, he returned in disgrace, hiding at home, staying indoors, and eating and drinking in silence.

To avoid embarrassing Mr. Qi, the friend pretended not to know and deliberately did not visit his home, only inquiring from relevant informed parties to find out the truth.

It turned out that the diplomats from our country stationed in the relatively developed country along the Adriatic Sea did not buy Mr. Qi's routine. They only recognized talent and did not talk about connections. He tested Mr. Qi for three months and accurately understood that Mr. Qi did not know trade, did not know foreign languages, did not know information, and could not drive a car. He was completely unfit to be a commercial representative and kindly advised him to return to where he came from. But Mr. Qi firmly believed in the effectiveness of the connection theory and not only did he not listen to the advice but also secretly sent the diplomat two pounds of American ginseng and a diamond-studded red jade ring. Just when he thought he was about to succeed, he did not expect the diplomat from Guangdong to turn red with anger and suddenly slap the table, "Mr. Qi, I only know that you are incompetent, but I did not know that you are also so despicable. I have no choice but to fire you!"

Mr. Qi still tried to turn the passive situation around, boldly smiling and joking, "Comrade, you are from the south. In our north, firing someone is called moving the dung beetle."

The diplomat wanted to laugh but did not. After calming down, he immediately realized that his previous words were not dignified enough for a diplomat, so he said softly, "Whatever it is called, Mr. Qi, the ticket has been bought. Please return to the country tomorrow!"

    齐老板出洋　〔小小说〕
    陈新
    外贸局局长齐天，人称齐老板。
    齐老板原名齐整，是他的生身爹娘煞费苦心给起的。用意并不奢侈，只盼望儿子长大成才，齐齐整整，不搞歪的邪的。二老用心良苦，但不知儿郎远大抱负：做人只做到齐整太容易也太渺小了，他要做孙悟空，当齐天大圣。后来他自作主张，废黜了爹娘的赐予，改名齐天。
    齐老板官运亨通，年年进步，由科员到科长；由科长到处长；由处长到局长。最近，又被选拔推荐到亚德里亚海沿岸一个较发达国家当商务代表。出洋赴任，官位显赫，光宗耀祖，令人垂涎。眼见着，他真的就要齐天了。
    临行前，一位密友前来送行，顺便向他求教进身术。齐老板把密友领到密室密谈：“看起来复杂说出来简单，只要你今后能分清并摆正金牌、银牌、铜牌的位置，保管你步步高升。”
    金、银、铜牌不是体育场上的竞赛奖标志吗？这又不是跑步游泳打排球，与高升不高升有何必然联系呢？密友百思不得其解，眨着小眼疑惑地望着齐老板，继续虔诚地求教。
    “这叫借用。”齐天见密友脑瓜子太死，不得不详解了，“如今，一个人要想不断得到提拔重用，需要具备三个条件，即：学历、年龄和关系。你说对不对？我再问你，这三者哪个最吃紧？以愚兄之见，关系是金牌，年龄是银牌，至于学历么，只能算个臭铜牌。”
    密友恍然大悟，随之瞠目结舌。
    “你以为我这个秘诀不灵？”齐老板见密友反应实在迟钝得可以，又进一步以现身说法和实例来论证他的进身术：“先说我自己吧，学历，中学尚未毕业；年龄，还有半载年满花甲。何以提拔得这样神速，最近又点名派我出洋赴任呢？一言以蔽之，紧紧抓住关系这块金牌。再说我的左膀右臂，他们两个你也是熟悉的，一个叫阳货，扫盲的文化水平，浑名生产队大队长；另一个叫交流，倒是有学历，可也跟我一个样，对外贸这一行，说句大白话——狗屁不通。可他们在外贸局又何以能够一人之下、万人之上呢？这其中的奥妙，难道还需要我一一点破吗？”
    密友似醍醐灌顶，顿开茅塞。他举杯向齐老板祝贺，心中却为他这次出洋赴任暗暗叫苦：“你的金牌、银牌、铜牌学说此次恐怕难以奏效了。”
    果然不出密友所料，齐老板到了亚德里亚海沿岸那个较发达国家赴任不久，也就三个月的光景，便灰溜溜退职而回，躲在家中深居简出，闷吃闷喝。
    唯恐臊了齐老板的面皮，密友佯装不知，故意不登其家门，只在有关知情人那里打听个明白。
    原来，我们国家驻亚德里亚海沿岸那个较发达国家的外交官不吃齐老板那一套，只认才华，不讲关系。他对齐老板试用了三个月，确切了解到齐老板一不懂贸易，二不懂外文，三不懂信息，四不会开车，压根不配当什么商务代表，便好言好语地规劝他哪里来还回哪里去。但齐老板深信关系学的妙用，不但不听劝，反而偷偷给外交官送去二斤西洋花旗参和一枚带钻石的足赤戒指。正当他自以为就要得计的时候，却不料那位广东籍的外交官憋红了脸，猛地一拍桌子，“齐老板，我只知道你无能，却不知道你还如此下作。我不得不炒你的鱿鱼！”
    齐老板仍然妄想扭转被动局面，厚着脸皮含笑话幽默：“同志，您是南方人，炒鱿鱼在我们北方叫屎壳郎搬家。”
    外交官想笑没有笑出来。消气后，马上意识到自己刚才不够冷净，“炒鱿鱼”的话似有失外交家的风度和身份，于是和缓地说：“不管叫什么吧，齐老板，机票已经买好了，请您明天就回国去吧！”
