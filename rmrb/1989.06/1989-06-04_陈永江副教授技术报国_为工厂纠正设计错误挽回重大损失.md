Associate Professor Chen Yongjiang Contributes Technology to the Nation and Corrects Design Errors to Prevent Major Losses for a Factory

	Chen Yongjiang, an associate professor at Xi'an Jiaotong University who has long been engaged in the research and design of compressors, demonstrated a sense of ownership and recently corrected a design error, saving the nation from a major loss of over 100 million yuan.

	In September 1988, while on a business trip to Nanjing, Chen Yongjiang saw the assembly drawing of a new product from Shenyang Gas Compressor Factory—the nitrogen-hydrogen gas compressor—at the Jiangsu Chemical Design Institute. He felt that the sixth cylinder of the machine had the potential to fracture. Before leaving, he copied the drawing. Upon returning to the school, he repeatedly verified the issue and confirmed the danger. To further verify, he requested a detailed drawing from the factory. After calculations, he completely confirmed that the equivalent stress of the relevant part had exceeded the yield limit. He estimated that after 1-2 years of operation, cracks on the high-pressure cylinder would develop into fractures, leading to an explosion and causing a serious accident.

	Chen Yongjiang obtained the school's leadership approval and rushed to Shenyang Gas Compressor Factory to propose improvement measures. At the same time, he submitted preventive opinions to the Chemical Industry Department's Fertilizer Bureau. Upon receiving the information, the factory immediately held an emergency meeting, reviewed the original design, confirmed the potential serious danger, and decided to temporarily suspend production and find ways to repair and replace the 11 machines that had already been shipped.

	According to experts' analysis, Chen Yongjiang's correction this time saved at least 100 million yuan in losses. As for preventing serious accidents and their adverse effects, that is incalculable in monetary terms.

　　陈永江副教授技术报国
    为工厂纠正设计错误挽回重大损失
    本报讯  记者王友恭报道：西安交通大学长期从事压缩机研究、设计工作的陈永江副教授发扬主人翁精神，前不久纠正了一个设计错误，为国家挽回亿元重大损失。
    １９８８年９月，出差南京的陈永江在江苏化工设计院看到沈阳气体压缩机厂的新产品——氮氢气体压缩机的总装配图，感到该机的第６级气缸有发生断裂的可能。临行前，他复制了图纸，回校后经过反复校核，证实了这种危险性。为了进一步核实，他又向该厂索要一份详图，经过计算完全证实有关部分的当量应力已超过屈服极限，估计运行１—２年，高压缸上的裂纹就会发展到断裂，引起爆炸，酿成严重事故。
    陈永江征得学校领导同意，火速赶往沈阳气体压缩机厂提出改进措施，同时向化工部化肥司提出预防意见。厂方得知后，连夜召开紧急会议，核算原设计，证实了潜在的严重危险，决定立即暂停生产并设法返修更换已出厂的１１台机器。
    据专家们分析，陈永江这次纠错的结果，至少挽回损失上亿元。至于防止严重事故的恶劣影响，那是无法用金钱计算的。
