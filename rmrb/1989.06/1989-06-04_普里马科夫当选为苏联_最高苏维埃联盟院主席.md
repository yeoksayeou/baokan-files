59-year-old Soviet scholar Primakov, an academician, was elected chairman of the Union Council of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR at the first meeting of the Union Council held this afternoon.

The Union Council and the Council of Nationalities are the two equal chambers of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR, each consisting of 271 representatives. Today, when Primakov was elected chairman of the Union Council, there were no objections, and 3 abstained.

Primakov graduated from the Moscow Institute of Oriental Studies, formerly worked as a reporter for *Pravda*, and served as the director of the Institute of Oriental Studies. Since 1985, he has been the director of the Institute of World Economy and International Relations and is a member of the Central Committee of the CPSU. Today, when the representatives of the Union Council discussed his candidacy, they generally praised him for being well-versed, steady, principled, cultured, and good at listening to different opinions.

After his election, he immediately took over from Gorbachev and sat in the chairman's seat, presiding over the Union Council's discussion on the establishment of committees to handle various issues.

Gorbachev said at the opening ceremony of the Union Council meeting today that the most important task facing the Soviet parliament is to promote and deepen the already begun reforms to produce positive results. Gorbachev said that the USSR is clearly distinguishing between legislative and executive functions, and the process of decentralization in the fields of management, economy, and spiritual life is increasingly developing. The Soviet parliament will play a more active role in this regard.

    新华社莫斯科６月３日电  （记者盛世良）５９岁的苏联著名学者普里马科夫院士，在今天下午举行的苏联最高苏维埃联盟院第一次会议上，当选为联盟院主席。
    联盟院和民族院同为苏联最高苏维埃平等的两院，各由２７１名代表组成。今天在选举普里马科夫为联盟院主席时，无人反对，３人弃权。
    普里马科夫毕业于莫斯科东方学院，曾任《真理报》记者，东方研究所所长，１９８５年起任世界经济和国际关系研究所所长，是苏共中央委员。联盟院代表今天在讨论他的候选人资格时，普遍称赞他博学、稳重，讲原则，有修养，善于听取不同意见。
    他当选后即接替戈尔巴乔夫坐到主席座上，主持联盟院有关成立处理各类问题的委员会的讨论。
    戈尔巴乔夫今天在主持联盟院会议开幕式时说，苏联议会面临的最主要问题是推动、深化已经开始的改革，使之产生积极成果。戈尔巴乔夫说，苏联正在明确区分立法和执行职能，管理、经济和精神生活领域的非集中化进程日益发展，苏联议会将在这方面起更积极的作用。
