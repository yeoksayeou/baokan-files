The Jinan Children's Drama Troupe has brought the stage into the schools, performing regularly in elementary schools across the province. Their performances have been warmly received by children and praised by schools. Since 1987, they have visited over 900 elementary schools and performed nearly a thousand children's plays.

The troupe has created eight children's plays tailored to the psychological needs and weaknesses of children. For example, based on the phenomenon of some students disliking reading, they created the science popularization comedy "A Robot Comes to My Home." The play tells the story of a student named Xiaojian who, because he doesn't like to study and doesn't understand the structure of robots, is punished by a robot. The entire play is full of humor, and students gain enlightenment amidst laughter. This play has been performed over a hundred times, each time receiving a round of applause.

Although these are commercial performances, the troupe does not focus on the money but rather on social benefits. They perform for schools with many students and for those with few; they go to schools with convenient transportation and to remote schools. Once, they performed in Wujiapu Town, Jinan City, where there was no suitable venue. They were assigned to perform on a sandy beach by the Yellow River. At that time, the sun was scorching, and the sand was hot. Despite this, they performed without complaint for students from six schools. Because the area was relatively poor, the troupe only collected 24 yuan. However, when they heard the children's laughter and cheers, they felt greatly satisfied.

　　舞台进校园　演出近千场
    济南市儿童话剧团越办越活
    新华社济南电  （通讯员于海丰）济南市儿童话剧团把舞台搬进校园，常年在省内各地小学演出，深受儿童欢迎和学校称赞。一九八七年以来他们已到过九百多所小学，演出儿童剧近千场。
    这个剧团根据儿童心理和存在的一些弱点，有针对性地创作了八部儿童剧。例如，从一些小学生厌烦读书这一现象出发，创作了科普儿童喜剧《我家来了机器人》，描写一个名叫小刚的小学生因不爱学习，不懂机器人的构造，而受到机器人惩罚的故事。全剧情趣盎然，学生在笑声中得到启迪。这出儿童剧连续演出上百场，场场换来掌声一片。
    虽是营业性演出，但剧团不把眼睛盯在钱上，而是着眼于社会效益。学校人多演，人少也演；交通方便的学校去，偏僻的学校也去演。有一次，他们到济南市吴家铺镇演出，那里没有一个像样的场地，被指定在黄河岸边的一片沙滩上演出。当时骄阳似火，沙滩上热气逼人，他们毫无怨言，坚持为六所小学的学生演出。因为那里比较贫困，剧团只收了二十四元钱。然而，当他们听到孩子们的笑声、欢呼声时，心里感到极大的满足。
