Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 17th.

In recent days, some rioters who engaged in looting, arson, and vandalism during the counterrevolutionary riot, as well as some lawbreakers who incited counterrevolutionary activities, have been captured and brought to justice by the public security organs.

The captured rioter Bai Xinyu, male, 61 years old, has been sentenced multiple times since 1958 for crimes such as hooliganism and attempted murder. On June 4th, Bai believed that the time for revenge against the government had come. He went to the west side of the Muxidi Bridge and used military tarps and cotton pants to burn two armored vehicles of the martial law troops. He also stole military raincoats, belts, and other military supplies, taking them back home. At the same time, he spread rumors and counterrevolutionary propaganda at the scene.

The criminal Yang Yijun, captured by the Shijingshan Public Security Sub-bureau, is a student of the Beijing University of Science and Technology, Mining and Metallurgy Department, Class of 1987. On the evening of June 3rd at 11 PM, when the martial law troops were blocked in the Shijingshan District near Laoshan, he ferociously threw stones at the blocked military vehicles. Later, he used gasoline to ignite cotton threads, burning 12 military vehicles.

The criminal Yang Ensen is a worker at the Beijing Sixth Construction Company. On the morning of June 4th around 8 AM, he saw several military vehicles stopped in the middle of the Laoshan Road. He shouted loudly, "The military vehicles in the city have all been burned, what are these vehicles still doing here?" He shouted this four or five times, engaging in counterrevolutionary incitement. Afterwards, several rioters burned these military vehicles.

The criminal Wu Rangyuan, female, 46 years old, a laboratory technician at the Chinese Academy of Sciences Semiconductor Research Institute, was captured by the public security organs after being reported by the masses. Since June 3rd, Wu has been spreading rumors and inciting others in the Xidan and Liubukou areas. On the evening of June 6th, she incited a group of people to smash into the traffic squad, claiming that riot police were stationed inside. She also spread rumors that the military vehicles were not burned by rioters but by the military themselves. At the Xidan intersection, she told some people setting up roadblocks with carts, "You can't place them horizontally, you have to place them vertically, so the military vehicles can't knock them over." When some rioters failed to burn the vehicles, she shouted, "The metal won't catch fire, you have to burn the wheels!"

　　北京又抓获一些暴徒和不法分子
    新华社北京６月１７日电  近日，在反革命暴乱中打砸抢烧的一些暴徒和进行反革命煽动的不法分子，先后被公安机关抓获归案。
    被抓获的暴徒白信禹，男，６１岁，自１９５８年以来曾因流氓、杀人未遂等罪行先后多次被劳动教养、判刑。６月４日，白犯自以为报复政府的时机已到，便窜到木樨地桥西侧，用军苫布、棉裤先后烧毁戒严部队的装甲车两辆，并抢得军用雨衣、皮带等军用物品带回家中，同时还在现场造谣惑众，散布反革命言论。
    由石景山公安分局抓获的案犯杨毅军，是北京科技大学分校矿冶系８７级学生，６月３日晚１１时，当戒严部队行进到石景山区老山受阻时，他穷凶极恶地用石块猛砸被堵截的军车，后用汽油点燃棉丝将１２辆军车烧毁。
    案犯杨恩森，是北京市第六建筑公司工人，６月４日早８时许，见几辆军车停在老山马路中间，就扯着嗓子高喊：“城里的军车都烧了，这些车还留着它干什么？”一连喊了四五遍，大肆进行反革命煽动。之后，几个暴徒便将这些军车烧毁。
    经群众检举、由公安机关抓获的犯罪分子吴让元，女，４６岁，中科院半导体研究所实验师。吴自６月３日以来，先后在西单、六部口一带造谣、传谣，进行煽动，并于６月６日晚煽动一伙人冲砸交通中队，说里面驻有防暴警察。她还造谣说军车不是暴徒烧的，是军队自己烧的，并在西单路口对一些正在推车设置路障的人说，你们不能横放，要竖着放，这样军车才撞不翻。当一些暴徒烧车烧不着时，她又大喊，铁皮点不着，轱辘上才能烧着呢。
    目前，对以上案犯都在进一步审查中。
