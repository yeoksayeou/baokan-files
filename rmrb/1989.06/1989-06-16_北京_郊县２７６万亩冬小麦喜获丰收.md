Beijing suburbs have harvested 2760,000 mu of winter wheat this year with great success. In recent days, various districts and counties have been successively harvesting, threshing, and storing the wheat.

In Fangshan District's Doudian Village, Beijing's top labor model, Zhang Zhenliang, told the reporter, "Doudian Village's 3740 mu of winter wheat will yield about 100 jin more per mu compared to last year. The total yield will reach a historic high, exceeding 1500,000 jin. We will definitely sell the best wheat to the state!"

Since last winter and this spring, suburban farmers have responded to the call from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council to prioritize and strengthen agriculture. They have diligently focused on fertilizing, spring irrigation, and field management of winter wheat. Relevant department officials told the reporter that this year's 2760,000 mu of winter wheat in Beijing suburbs will set a historic high in total yield, with an expected increase of more than 10% in yield per mu compared to last year.
