Yesterday afternoon, over 300 college students from nine institutions, including Shanxi University and Taiyuan Teachers College, participated in the voluntary labor to repair May 1st Square.

The square, located in the heart of Taiyuan City, was recently trampled during student protests and gatherings, leaving the lawn in disarray, railings toppled, and litter scattered everywhere.

Yang Xiaodong, a student from the Philosophy Department, Class of 1987, at Shanxi University, said, "We trampled the lawn of the square before, and today we are here to work and make amends, also to express our apologies."

Taiyuan City Mayor Wan Liang also worked alongside the students. Some students said, "We did some foolish things in the past." Mayor Wan replied, "You can mature through reflection."

Some teachers from Taiyuan's colleges also participated in the voluntary labor.

    太原大学生整修五一广场
    新华社太原６月１８日电  （记者杜文峰）昨天下午山西大学、太原师专等９所高校的３００多名大学生，参加了整修五一广场的义务劳动。
    位于太原市中心的五一广场，前段时间因学生游行、集会，草坪被人踩踏得狼籍一片，栏杆倾倒，丢弃物触目皆是。
    山西大学哲学系８７级学生杨小东说：“广场草坪，我们过去踩踏过，今天来劳动，弥补一下，也表示一点歉意。”
    太原市市长万良适也和学生一起劳动。一些学生说：我们前一段做了一些蠢事。万市长说：“你们通过反思可以成熟起来。”
    太原高校一些教师也参加了义务劳动。
