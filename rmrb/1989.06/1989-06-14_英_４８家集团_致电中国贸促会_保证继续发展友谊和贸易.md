On June 12, the honorary chairman of the UK "48 Group," G. Sloan, and the chairman, T. Went, cabled the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, represented by Zheng Hongye, stating that the group's planned trade with relevant provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities in China for 1990-1995 will not change.

The telegram stated, "The members of our group, like you, have been closely following the recent developments. We wish to assure you that, as old friends of the Chinese people, we will, as we have done over the past 35 years, continue to work with confidence to develop friendship and trade with you."

The telegram also mentioned that the group sent similar telegrams to the relevant provincial and municipal leaders in China, expressing strong support for the local people.
