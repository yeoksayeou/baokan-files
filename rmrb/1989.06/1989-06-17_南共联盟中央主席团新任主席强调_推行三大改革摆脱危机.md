The newly appointed Chairman of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, M. Panchevski, emphasized that the only way for Yugoslavia to overcome its current crisis is to implement the three major reforms that have already been announced: economic, political, and party reforms.

Panchevski made these remarks in an interview with the Yugoslav News Agency and the weekly newspaper of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, "Communist." On June 16, all Yugoslav newspapers carried his interview.

Panchevski pointed out in the interview that Yugoslavia has been facing a long-term crisis, indicating that the current socio-economic development concept has objectively lost its effectiveness. Therefore, it is necessary to seek new development paths, which are the three major reforms that have already begun. He believes that overcoming the current crisis requires two prerequisites. First, the entire Yugoslav society must formulate a unified policy and take concerted action in the basic directions, goals, and content of the three major reforms. Second, the role of a unified and powerful Yugoslav Federation must be fully played. Only a stable, unified, independent, and non-aligned Yugoslavia can guarantee the realization of the wishes and interests of all ethnic groups.

In discussing the three major reforms, Panchevski pointed out that the main goal of economic reform is to establish a new socio-economic system based on respect for economic and market laws. The main goal of political reform is to promote genuine democratization, ensure the establishment of complete self-governing social relations, and lay the social foundation for the working class. It is necessary to thoroughly implement decentralization and anti-bureaucratization, and eliminate bureaucratism and officialdom. Strengthen the sense of responsibility of each republic for the overall development of Yugoslavia and ensure the macroeconomic functions of the Federation. The goal of party reform is to eliminate its own bureaucratization and monopoly over the working class and society, so that the party can truly become the political and ideological vanguard of the working class.

　　南共联盟中央主席团新任主席强调
    推行三大改革摆脱危机
    新华社贝尔格莱德６月１６日电  新任南共联盟中央主席团主席米·潘切夫斯基强调指出，南斯拉夫摆脱目前危机的唯一出路在于推行已经宣布的经济、政治和共盟３大改革。
    潘切夫斯基是对南通社和南共联盟机关报《共产主义者》周报发表谈话时说这番话的。１６日南斯拉夫各报均转载了他的谈话。
    潘切夫斯基在谈话中指出，南斯拉夫社会长期以来面临危机，说明现在的社会经济发展概念在客观上已失去效力，因而必须寻求新的发展道路，这就是已经开始推行的３大改革。他认为，克服目前危机有两个前提。一是整个南斯拉夫社会必须在３大改革的基本方向、目标和内容方面制订出统一的方针和采取一致行动。二是必须彻底发挥统一的和强有力的南斯拉夫联邦的应有作用。只有稳定的、统一的、独立的和不结盟的南斯拉夫才能保证实现各族人民的愿望和利益。
    潘切夫斯基在谈到３大改革时指出，经济改革的目的主要是建立基于尊重经济规律和市场规律之上的新的社会经济体制。政治改革的主要目的是推行真正的民主化，保证建立完整的自治社会关系和工人阶级的社会基础。彻底实行非集权化和非官僚主义化，并消除文牍主义和衙门作风。加强各共和国对整个南斯拉夫发展的责任感，保证联邦的宏观经济职能。共盟改革的目的则是消除本身的官僚化以及对工人阶级和社会的垄断，从而使共盟真正成为工人阶级的政治思想先锋队。
