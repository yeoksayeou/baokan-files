    Reporter Jing Xianfeng reports from Xi'an: At 19:55 today, the Baocheng Railway, which had been disrupted due to a landslide, resumed operations after emergency repairs. A freight train safely passed through the affected area.

    On June 21st, the Baocheng Railway was severely damaged by a landslide. Senior officials from the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau and the Xi'an Railway Division quickly arrived at the scene and mobilized over 1,360 workers to begin emergency repairs. The workers, without regard for compensation, endured harsh conditions and worked tirelessly day and night. After eight days and seven nights of hard work, they cleared over 60,000 cubic meters of soil and rocks, completing the repairs two days ahead of schedule.

    During the emergency repairs, the local government and party leadership of Feng County, Shaanxi Province, provided significant support in terms of materials and labor to the railway department.

　　宝成铁路恢复通车
    本报西安６月２８日电  记者景险峰报道：今天１９时５５分，因山体滑塌造成运输中断的宝成铁路经过抢修，已开通恢复营运，一列货车安全地通过了出事地点。
    ６月２１日，宝成铁路遭灾后，郑州铁路局和西安铁路分局的主要负责同志很快赶到现场，并迅速调集了１３６０多名员工投入抢修。工人们不计报酬，风餐露宿。经过八天七夜苦战，共清理土石方６万多立方米，比原计划提前两天修复通车。
    抢修中，陕西省凤县党政领导机关在物资和劳力方面给铁路部门以很大支持。
