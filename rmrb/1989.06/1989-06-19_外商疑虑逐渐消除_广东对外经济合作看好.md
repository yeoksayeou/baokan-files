Guangdong, which has been at the forefront of reform and opening up, has maintained a stable situation. Foreign investors' concerns are gradually dissipating. Those who hastily left during the recent period have returned, and those who have stayed are even more confident in their investments. The province's economic cooperation with foreign countries is in good shape.

According to a recent report from the provincial foreign economic and trade commission to more than 30 foreign business representatives from Guangzhou and the Pearl River Delta region: In the first five months of this year, the province signed 2,946 contracts with foreign investors, including $2.1 billion in contracted foreign investment and $1.1 billion in actual foreign investment, both more than double the figures for the same period last year. There has been a noticeable increase in wholly foreign-owned enterprises. The export value of "three types of enterprises" (wholly foreign-owned, joint ventures, and cooperative enterprises) reached more than $500 million, a 51% increase over the same period last year.

The momentum has been even better in June. The Daya Bay Nuclear Power Station is the most concentrated area of foreign investment in Shenzhen, and not a single person has left so far. On June 15, the signing ceremony for the loan agreement for the Guangzhou Pumped Storage Power Station, a key supporting project for the nuclear power station, was held. This is the first pumped storage power station in China, built with a $200 million mixed loan from the French government. Several other project agreements and contracts are also being signed in succession. Before May 10, more than 1,000 Wanbao refrigerators from the Guangzhou Wanbao Electrical Appliances Group Company crossed the Pacific Ocean into the American market. On June 13, the company signed a contract with the Italian Menoni Design Company to introduce the key equipment for the country's largest drum washing machine, with an annual production capacity of 200,000 drum washing machines, 70% of which will be exported.

At the contract signing ceremony, Filippo, the commercial manager of the Italian Menoni Design Company, said: "The situation in Guangdong is very stable, and we are full of confidence in conducting economic, technological, and trade cooperation with China."

　　外商疑虑逐渐消除
    广东对外经济合作看好
    本报广州６月１９日电  记者梁兆明报道：改革、开放先走一步的广东省，局势一直稳定，外商的疑虑逐渐消除，前段时间匆匆离境的也陆续归来，一直坚持下来的更加放心投资，对外经济合作情况良好。
    据省外经贸委日前对来自广州市和珠江三角洲地区的３０多家客商的通报：今年头５个月，全省与外商签订合同２９４６个，其中合同利用外资２１亿美元，实际利用外资１１亿美元，均比去年同期增长１倍多；外商独资企业明显增加；“三资”企业出口额达５亿多美元，比去年同期增长５１％。
    进入６月份，发展势头更好。大亚湾核电站是深圳市内外商最密集的地方，至今没有１人离开。６月１５日，核电站的重要配套工程广州抽水蓄能电站的转贷协议书举行交换仪式。这是由法国政府提供２亿美元混合贷款建造的我国第一个抽水蓄能电站。还有一批项目的协议、合同也在陆续签订。５月１０日前，广州万宝电器集团公司１０００多台万宝冰箱横渡太平洋进入美国市场，６月１３日又与意大利梅诺尼设计公司签订合同，引进目前全国最大的滚筒洗衣机关键设备，投产后年产滚筒洗衣机２０万台，７０％供出口。
    在合同签字仪式上，意大利梅诺尼设计公司商务经理菲利普先生说：“广东局势很稳定，我们对和中国进行经济、技术、贸易合作充满信心。”
