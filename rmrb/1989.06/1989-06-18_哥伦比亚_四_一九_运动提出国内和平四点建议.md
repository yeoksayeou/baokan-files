	Colombia's "April 19th" Movement Proposes Four-Point Suggestions for Domestic Peace

	Caracas, June 18 (Xinhua) -- The leader of Colombia's April 19th Movement, Carlos Pizarro, has put forward a new peace proposal, expressing a willingness to disarm and hand over weapons to become a political organization on the basis of a political agreement and a civil referendum.

	On the evening of the 13th, the press office of the Colombian presidential palace distributed a letter from the commander-in-chief of the April 19th Movement, Pizarro, to President Barco and the leaders of the two major political parties. The letter proposed four points for the demobilization of this guerrilla force. 1) The government should submit a political agreement, reached unanimously in peace talks by the authorities, various political parties, and the April 19th Movement, to the Congress to make it a legally binding document; 2) Conduct electoral reforms to ensure that all political parties have equal access to government election funds and media channels during campaigns; 3) The parties in Congress should take on the responsibility of ensuring that the political agreement is passed in the legislature; 4) Hold a civil referendum on peace and democracy issues, allowing the entire nation to vote on the various reform agreements reached during the peace process. After these legal procedures are completed, the April 19th Movement will lay down all its weapons and transform into a political organization.

	The April 19th Movement is one of the six guerrilla groups in Colombia. In March of this year, this guerrilla force reached a ceasefire agreement with the government. If Pizarro's proposal can gain the support of the authorities and the ruling Liberal Party and the main opposition party, the Conservative Party, a new phase in Colombia's peace process will emerge.

　　哥伦比亚“四·一九”运动提出国内和平四点建议
    本报加拉加斯电  记者朱满庭报道：哥伦比亚游击队四·一九运动领导人卡洛斯·皮萨罗提出一项新的和平建议，表示在一项政治协议和公民投票的基础上解除武装、交出武器，成为一个政治组织。
    １３日晚哥伦比亚总统府新闻秘书处散发了四·一九运动总司令皮萨罗致巴尔科总统和两大主要政党领导人的一封信，信中提出了实现这支游击队非武装化的４点意见。１、政府应将由当局、各政党和四·一九运动在和平谈判中一致达成的政治协议提交国会，使之形成具有法律效力的文件；２、进行选举改革，确保各政党在竞选中平等地享有政府的选举经费和新闻传播渠道；３、国会中的各政党承担义务，使政治协议在立法院得以通过；４、就和平与民主问题举行公民投票，让全国人民就和平进程中达成的各种改革协议进行表决。这些法制程序完成后，四·一九运动将全部放下武器，变成一个政治组织。
    四·一九运动是哥６支游击队中的一支，今年３月，这支游击队与政府达成了停火协议。如皮萨罗的建议能得到当局和执政的自由党和主要反对党、保守党的支持，哥伦比亚的和平进程将出现一个新的局面。
