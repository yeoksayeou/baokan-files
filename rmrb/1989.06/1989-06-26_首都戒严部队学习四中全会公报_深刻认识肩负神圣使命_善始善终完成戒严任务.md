Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 26th.

The capital martial law troops have been studying and discussing the communiqué of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee. They firmly support the decisions made by the plenum and are determined to carry out the tasks proposed by the plenum with concrete actions, ensuring the complete success of the struggle to quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

In recent days, various martial law troops in the capital have held meetings for leaders and staff at the regiment level and above to convey and study the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee. Troops stationed at various checkpoints have also taken the time to listen to and watch news about the plenum and its communiqué, engaging in heated discussions. Some units have focused on topics such as "deeply understanding the great significance of the Fourth Plenum," "deeply understanding the extreme necessity of the Party Central Committee's organizational adjustments," "deeply understanding the four major tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenum," and "deeply understanding the sacred mission shouldered by the military, especially the martial law troops," conducting in-depth discussions to align their thoughts with the spirit of the Fourth Plenum. The soldiers unanimously believe that the Fourth Plenum is another important milestone in the history of our Party. This meeting, held at a critical moment of life and death for the Party and the country, will have a profound and far-reaching impact on the complete suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the further stabilization of the national situation, and the successful development of the reform and opening-up and construction cause.

Many comrades mentioned in their studies that Zhao Ziyang, as the General Secretary of the Party, violated the Party's organizational principles, supported the turmoil, and split the Party, bearing unshirkable responsibility for the two-month-long turmoil and rebellion. The Fourth Plenum's exposure, criticism, and organizational handling of Zhao Ziyang's errors are completely necessary and correct. Everyone pointed out in the discussions that the lessons from this turmoil and rebellion are deeply profound. The most important lesson is abandoning the Chinese characteristics and giving up the four cardinal principles, the foundation of the country. Everyone believes that the Fourth Plenum's proposal to continue firmly implementing the line, policies, and principles since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee and the basic line of "one center, two basic points" determined by the Thirteenth Party Congress is extremely correct. Especially, the emphasis of the Fourth Plenum on "the four cardinal principles are the foundation of the country and must be upheld unwaveringly and consistently; reform and opening-up is the path to a strong country and must be firmly and consistently implemented, never returning to the old path of closing the door to the outside world" reflects the common aspirations of the entire Party, the entire military, and the entire nation, making us more confident in the future of the Party and the country.

Everyone believes that the Fourth Plenum's election of Jiang Zemin as the General Secretary of the Party and the strengthening of the core leadership of the Party Central Committee will ensure the continuity of our Party's policies and ensure that our Party continues on the path opened by Deng Xiaoping and other older-generation proletarian revolutionaries. This is a powerful guarantee for the success of China's modernization drive.

The Fourth Plenum highly praised the contributions of our military in this struggle against turmoil and the suppression of the rebellion, greatly encouraging the broad masses of martial law troops. They expressed their determination to study seriously, understand their responsibilities, fulfill their missions, further strengthen ideological and political work, manage the troops well, maintain high stability, unity, and political vigilance, carry forward the fine traditions and style of hard work and plain living of our military, and complete the martial law mission well. Soldiers stationed in Haidian District and Shijingshan District, while studying the communiqué of the Fourth Plenum in conjunction with their actual situations, deepened their understanding of the current situation and tasks. They said that the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion is extremely arduous and complex, and we must maintain high morale and carry this struggle through to the end. They also studied and formulated specific measures to cooperate with local public security departments in investigating criminals, strengthening the guard of key targets, and patrolling important transportation routes. Many units have written letters of application and declarations, requesting to undertake the most arduous tasks and determined to complete the martial law mission successfully. The Party Committee of the unit where the loyal guardian of the Republic, martyr Chui Guozheng, served, proposed specific requirements for the unit to deeply implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenum: strengthen the construction of clean government, better play the role of the Party organization as a fortress and the vanguard model role of Communist Party members in completing the martial law mission; strengthen ideological and political work, consolidate and expand the achievements, and achieve a complete victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Some units also expressed their determination to continue doing a good job in propaganda among the masses, spreading the voice of the Party Central Committee, strengthening military-civilian relations, and working with the broad masses to make new contributions to the development of a stable and united political situation.

　　首都戒严部队学习四中全会公报    
    深刻认识肩负神圣使命  善始善终完成戒严任务
    新华社北京６月２６日电  首都戒严部队广大官兵认真学习讨论党的十三届四中全会公报，坚决拥护全会作出的各项决定，决心以实际行动贯彻落实全会提出的任务，把平息反革命暴乱的斗争进行到底。
    连日来，首都各戒严部队多次召开团以上领导干部和机关干部会议，传达、学习十三届四中全会精神。分散在各个执勤点上的干部、战士，也抓紧时间收听收看四中全会的新闻和会议公报，展开热烈的讨论。一些部队在学习中，围绕“深刻认识四中全会的重大意义”、“深刻认识党中央进行组织调整的极端必要性”、“深刻认识四中全会提出的四项重要任务”、“深刻认识军队特别是戒严部队肩负的神圣使命”等专题，进行座谈讨论，把思想统一到四中全会的精神上来。指战员们一致认为，四中全会是我党历史上又一个重要里程碑。在党和国家生死存亡的紧急关头召开的这次会议，对于彻底平息反革命暴乱，促进全国局势的进一步稳定，推动改革开放和建设事业的胜利发展，必将产生重大和深远的影响。
    许多同志在学习中说，赵紫阳同志作为党的总书记，却违反党的组织原则，支持动乱，分裂党，对这次长达两个月的动乱和暴乱负有不可推卸的责任。四中全会对赵紫阳同志错误的揭露、批评和对他的组织处理，是完全必要和非常正确的。大家在讨论中指出，发生这次动乱和暴乱，教训极其深刻。其中重要的是丢掉中国特色，放弃四项基本原则这个立国之本。大家认为，四中全会提出要继续坚决执行党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针和政策，继续执行党的十三大确定的“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线非常正确，特别是四中全会强调的“四项基本原则是立国之本，必须毫不动摇、始终一贯地加以坚持；改革开放是强国之路，必须坚定不移、一如既往地贯彻执行，绝不回到闭关锁国的老路上去”，反映了全国、全党和全军官兵的共同愿望，使我们对党和国家的前途更加充满信心。
    大家认为，四中全会选举江泽民为党的总书记，加强党中央的核心领导，将保证我们党的政策的连续性，保证我们的党沿着邓小平等老一辈无产阶级革命家开辟的道路走下去。这对于我国四个现代化大业的成功是个有力的保证。
    四中全会高度评价了我军在这次反对动乱、平息暴乱中的贡献，使戒严部队广大官兵受到巨大鼓舞。他们表示，一定要认真学习，认清责任，不辱使命，进一步加强思想政治工作，抓好部队的管理，保持高度稳定统一和政治警惕性，发扬我军艰苦奋斗的优良传统和作风，善始善终完成戒严任务。在海淀区和石景山区执行戒严任务的某部干部、战士结合实际学习四中全会公报，加深了对当前形势和任务的认识。他们说，平息反革命暴乱的斗争是十分艰巨复杂的，我们必须保持高昂的斗志，把这场斗争进行到底。他们还研究制定了配合地方公安部门清查歹徒、加强重点目标警戒和交通要道执勤的具体措施。许多单位纷纷写请战书、决心书，要求担负最艰巨的任务，决心圆满完成戒严任务。共和国的忠诚卫士——崔国政烈士生前所在部队党委在学习讨论的基础上，对部队深入贯彻四中全会精神提出具体要求：加强廉政建设，在完成戒严任务中更好地发挥党组织的战斗堡垒作用和共产党员先锋模范作用；加强思想政治工作，巩固和扩大战果，夺取平息反革命暴乱的彻底胜利。一些部队还表示，要继续做好宣传群众工作，宣传党中央的声音，密切军政军民关系，同广大群众一道为发展安定团结的政治局面作出新贡献。
