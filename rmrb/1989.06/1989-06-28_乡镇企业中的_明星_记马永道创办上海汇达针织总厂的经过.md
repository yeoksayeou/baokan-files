A Star in Township Enterprises
—The Story of Ma Yongdao's Establishment of Shanghai Huida Knitting Factory
Zhang Guobao

He, Ma Yongdao, is an ordinary farmer from Jinwei Village, Fengxian District, Shanghai. He has turned a small village factory into a leading national township enterprise in the knitting industry with an annual output value of 37.03 million yuan, making it the first in the city to achieve the status of a second-class national enterprise.

Seven years ago, in early spring, the village allocated 6 million yuan to him to establish a new factory. The decision on how to build it and what industry to focus on was left to him, with the sole requirement that it must develop into a pillar of the village's industrial economy within a few years. Usually cheerful, Ma Yongdao fell silent.

A month later, he made his decision: to establish a knitting garment factory with products aimed at the export market. Immediately, objections, criticisms, and dissuasions poured in: "Are you crazy? Right now, domestic knitting garments are booming and highly profitable. Export products, aside from the high-quality requirements and low profits, delayed delivery can lead to losses!" "Hmph, not taking the easy money and picking the bones to chew, you're bound to fail!" Ma Yongdao's response was: "The domestic knitting garment industry is overheated, while the export market is relatively untapped. Getting in early can secure a foothold!"

Two years later, the domestic knitting garment industry in the city plummeted, and many township enterprises closed down. Ma Yongdao's Shanghai Huida Knitting Factory, however, rose to prominence. The investment paid off in the first year, and the products began to enter the international market.

In early 1985, Ma Yongdao partnered with the Shanghai Knitting Import and Export Company, a groundbreaking move in the Shanghai township knitting garment industry at the time. The factory's staff were worried, but soon they realized that Ma Yongdao's move was a brilliant one.

After the partnership, Ma Yongdao invited an experienced "old hand" in foreign trade to serve as a consultant and hired more than ten export salespeople as long-term part-time information gatherers for the factory. The factory developed over 30 popular new products in a year. Over the next four years, the factory's products were sold in 18 countries and regions across five continents, with annual sales volume increasing by an average of 300,000 pieces, 20 times the output of the first year.

In the fall of 1987, Ma Yongdao, as a representative of the city's township enterprises, participated in a visit to Japan by the city's foreign trade delegation. A knitting garment factory in Osaka, Japan, with only 150 employees, had a per capita output more than double that of Ma Yongdao's factory with over 800 employees, and the economic benefits of the enterprise were even higher. "Upon returning to the factory, we will implement major management reforms!" he said.

First came a series of "soft activities," such as having employees participate in the factory's "International Market" simulation activities, and having department heads and above study enterprise management, making the entire factory's staff eager to push for reform and scientific management. Later, Ma Yongdao launched major initiatives: implementing a full-quality reward and punishment system, a full-material consumption reward and punishment system, a full-floating wage system, and strictly enforcing factory rules and regulations...

The contrast was stark! The economic remuneration of the workers, according to the efficiency of their work, differed by more than one fold. However, all these measures were implemented smoothly and showed immediate results. In one workshop, a batch of garments destined for Australia had a slight quality issue, and the 400-plus workers had 10% of their monthly wages deducted. No one complained; instead, they redoubled their efforts and eventually became the workshop with the highest production difficulty in the factory, specializing in Japanese garments. A young worker in the dyeing workshop proposed a "comprehensive material allocation method," saving 200,000 yuan worth of dyeing auxiliaries annually.

The enterprise took off again! It was the first in the city's township enterprises to receive the Shanghai Enterprise Management Excellence Award and won the "Flying Dragon Award" for national township enterprise export earnings.

　　乡镇企业中的“明星”    
    ——记马永道创办上海汇达针织总厂的经过
    张国宝
    他、马永道，上海奉贤金汇乡的一位普通农民，竟把一家乡间小厂办成了全国乡镇同行业外向型大户：一年创产值３７０３万元，在全市乡镇同行业首家上了国家二级企业。
    ７年前初春，乡里借拨给６０万元资金，要他创办一家新工厂。怎么建、上什么产业等都由他定，但务必在数年内发展成能挑起全乡工业经济大梁的企业。向来乐呵呵的马永道沉默了。
    一个月后抉择作出：办针织服装厂，产品上外贸的。一时间，异议、责备、劝阻接踵而至：“你疯啦！现在‘内贸’针织服装正‘热’得上劲，好赚钱。而外贸的，撇开质量要求高与赢利低不说，拖了交货期限可得赔老本！”“哼，肥肉不吃挑骨头啃，准翻船！”马永道的回答是：“内贸针织服装业是虚热，外贸还没有多少人问，钻进去能占天地！”
    二年后，全市内贸针织服装业猛跌，一批乡镇企业随之关门散伙。马永道创办的这家上海汇达针织总厂异军崛起，当年投资当年见效，产品陆续进入国际市场。
    １９８５年初，马永道又与市针织进出口公司联营，这在当时上海乡镇针织服装业还是破天荒，厂里的干部职工忧心忡忡。但不久，他们深感马永道的这一步“棋”走得高。
    联营后，马永道从市进出口公司请来一位“老外贸”作高参，请１０多位外销员为本厂长年业余信息员。厂里一年开发了走俏的３０多种新产品。４年来，全厂产品扩销至五大洲的１８个国家和地区，年销售量平均递增达３０万打，是创建头年的２０倍。
    １９８７年深秋，马永道作为全市乡镇企业的代表参加市外贸代表团赴日本访问。日本大坂市的一家针织服装厂，职工仅１５０名，但与自己拥有８００多名的职工企业相比，人均产量高一倍多，企业经济效益还高出一截。“回厂后大刀阔斧上管理！”他说。
    先是一系列“软活动”，如职工们参加厂里的“国际商场”模拟活动，车间主任以上干部则学习起企业管理学，使全厂干部职工迫切要求推进改革上科学管理。此后，马永道推出大动作：全面实施质量奖罚制、物耗奖罚制，全面实行全浮动工资制，严格厂纪厂规……
    反差是强烈的！仅职工的经济报酬，按照工作效率两极高低相差一倍多。然而这一切的推行，风平浪静，即显成效。某车间加工一批销往澳大利亚的服装，质量稍出差错，共４００多名职工被扣除当月工资１０％，没有一人吵闹，发奋努力，后来居上，成为全厂产品生产难度最高的日本服装专业车间。漂染车间一位青工提出一条“统筹配料法”建议，年节省漂染助剂价值２０万元。
    企业再次腾飞！在全市乡镇企业第一家获得市企业管理优秀奖、荣获全国乡镇企业出口创汇“飞龙奖”。
