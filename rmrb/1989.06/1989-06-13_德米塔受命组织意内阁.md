Italian President Cossiga formally tasked the recently resigned Prime Minister Demita with forming a new cabinet this morning. Demita, who submitted his resignation on May 19th, was given the mandate by President Cossiga on May 26th to explore solutions to the government crisis. After two rounds of consultations with various political parties, trade unions, and local government leaders, President Cossiga made the decision last night.

Demita accepted the president's reappointment with reservations and stated in a press release that he would immediately begin frank and open consultations to overcome the difficulties that led to the government crisis. He also pledged to work towards forming a new government based on a political alliance of party platforms, without interfering with the upcoming European Parliament elections.

After tasking Demita with forming the new cabinet, President Cossiga also made a sudden statement to the press. Addressing certain parties' proposals to make decisions about forming the cabinet after the European Parliament elections, Cossiga stated that, according to Italy's political system, the procedure for resolving the crisis can only be carried out in this manner.

　　德米塔受命组织意内阁
    本报罗马６月１３日电  记者罗晋标报道：意大利总统科西加今天上午正式任命已经辞职的总理德米塔组织新内阁。
    德米塔总理５月１９日提出辞职后，科西加总统曾于５月２６日授命参议院议长斯帕多利尼试探解决政府危机的办法。斯帕多利尼与各政党、工会、地方政府领导人进行了两轮磋商后，科西加总统于昨晚作出了上述决定。
    德米塔有保留地接受了总统的重新任命，并在向记者发表的声明中表示，他将立即着手通过坦率的、开诚布公的磋商来克服造成政府危机的困难，并在不干预欧洲议会选举前提下，努力组成以各政党政治纲领联盟为基础的新政府。
    科西加总统在授命德米塔重新组阁后也突然向记者发表了讲话。针对某些党提出待欧洲议会选举后再作有关组阁决定的主张，科西加表示，根据意大利的政治体制，解决危机的程序只能采取这种作法。
