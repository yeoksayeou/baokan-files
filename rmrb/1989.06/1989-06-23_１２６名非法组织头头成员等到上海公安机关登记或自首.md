Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 23rd.

From June 15th to June 21st, 126 leaders and members of illegal organizations such as the "Shanghai Autonomous Federation of University Students" and the "Shanghai Autonomous Federation of Workers" have registered or surrendered to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau.

June 21st was the deadline set by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau for illegal and criminal elements to register or surrender. According to the Shanghai Public Security Department, during these seven days, those who registered or surrendered included 3 leaders of the "Shanghai Autonomous Federation of University Students," over 60 members of the "Shanghai Autonomous Federation of University Students," and leaders and members of other illegal organizations such as the "Shanghai Autonomous Federation of Workers." Many of these individuals who registered or surrendered expressed remorse for their previous actions and the serious consequences they caused, acknowledging that their illegal activities contributed to the chaos.

One university student, surnamed Lu, went to the Public Security Bureau to register and said with deep regret: "I joined the illegal organization 'Shanghai Autonomous Federation of University Students' and participated in its activities mainly because I was incited by some rumors and lost my composure. Now I realize that what I did was wrong and I must reflect on it." Another university student said after registering: "On June 5th, the school posted big-character posters saying that many people had died in Beijing. They also said that Shanghai would soon be under martial law and that troops had entered Kunshan. I was shocked and followed the crowd to set up barricades, engage in illegal activities, and join an illegal organization. Now, I have understood the truth. Our enthusiasm was exploited, and we were 'willingly' exploited. This only shows that our minds are too simple, too impulsive, and too easily swayed by rumors."

A hotel worker who went to the Public Security Bureau to surrender admitted that he had made inflammatory speeches. He said with regret: "After watching the television coverage of the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital, I was shocked. These real scenes are nothing like the 'bloodbath at Tiananmen' that the 'Shanghai Autonomous Federation of University Students' propagated. These facts made me wake up. I can no longer believe in rumors and be deceived."

　　１２６名非法组织头头成员等到上海公安机关登记或自首
    新华社上海６月２３日电（记者陈毛弟）记者从上海公安机关获悉：从６月１５日至６月２１日，已有１２６名上海“高自联”、“工自联”等非法组织头头、成员和其他违法犯罪人员前往登记或自首。
    ２１日是上海市公安机关规定违法犯罪人员登记、自首的最后一天。据上海公安部门介绍，在７天中前往登记或自首的人中有非法组织市“高自联”头头３人，市“高自联”成员和校“高自联”头头、成员６０余人。还有“工自联”等其他非法组织成员。这些登记、自首的人员中，许多人对自己前些时候的所作所为及造成的严重后果表示后悔，认为自己的违法行为造成了动乱的局面。
    一名姓陆的大学生前往公安机关登记时，沉痛地说：“我之所以参加了‘高自联’这个非法组织并参与活动，主要是受到一些谣言煽动而头脑发热。现在才认识到自己所干的事是错误的，一定要反省”。另一名大学生登记后说：“６月５日这天，学校贴出大字报，说北京死了多少多少人。又说上海马上要实行军管，昆山有部队开入市区等，我感到吃惊，也跟着去设路障，从事违法活动，并参加了非法组织。现在，我已明白了事实真相，我们的热情被人利用了，而且是‘自愿’被利用的。这只能说明我们头脑太简单，太容易冲动，太容易听信谣言。”
    一名宾馆工作人员前往公安机关投案自首时承认，自己发表了煽动性演讲。他后悔地说：“现在看了首都反革命暴乱的电视后，使我大吃一惊。这些真实镜头，根本不像‘高自联’所宣传的‘血洗天安门’那样。这些事实使我猛醒，再不能听谣信谣，受骗上当了。”
