Over ten thousand representatives from various countries and more than one thousand two hundred journalists gathered at the Montreal Convention Center today to begin a six-day conference on AIDS. The 5th International AIDS Conference aims to discuss how to combat the growing threat of AIDS.

The conference is jointly initiated by the International Development Research Center, the Canadian Department of Health and Welfare, and the World Health Organization, with the International AIDS Society also providing assistance.

Scientists from various countries will present over 5,500 research papers during the conference and various sub-group meetings. The conference will feature detailed discussions and lectures. The organizers believe that while it is not expected that a cure for AIDS will be found at this conference, bringing together everyone's research results and providing scientists with the opportunity to exchange ideas is highly beneficial.

At tonight's opening ceremony, Canadian Prime Minister Mulroney and Zambian President Kaunda both spoke, expressing their hopes for the success of the conference.

According to statistics from the World Health Organization in early May, by the end of April, the total number of officially reported AIDS patients worldwide had reached 151,790, an increase of 5,200 from the end of 1988. This figure does not include the more than 5 million people carrying the AIDS virus. Among the ten countries with the highest number of AIDS patients, the United States leads with 89,500 cases, accounting for 59% of the total, followed by Uganda with 6,000 cases, France with 5,000 cases, Brazil with 4,400 cases, Tanzania with 3,500 cases, Kenya with 2,730 cases, Malawi with 2,580 cases, West Germany, Italy, and Canada each with 2,000 cases.

The figures provided by the World Health Organization also indicate that the number of AIDS patients is doubling each year. By the end of 1986, there were 36,000 cases, which increased to 68,000 by the end of 1987, and doubled again to 132,000 by the end of 1988. Experts believe that by the end of the century, the number of people infected with the AIDS virus could reach 10 million.

Therefore, conquering AIDS has become a common task for people around the world, and this conference is highly valued by various countries. The first International AIDS Conference was held in Atlanta, USA, in 1985.

　　世界各国万余代表聚会蒙特利尔
    商讨对付艾滋病威胁
    本报蒙特利尔６月４日电  记者郭文福报道：来自世界各国的１１０００余名代表和１２００余名新闻记者，从今天开始会聚在蒙特利尔会议宫，举行为期６天的第５届艾滋病国际大会，研讨如何对付日益增长的艾滋病的威胁。
    这次会议是由国际发展研究中心，加拿大卫生福利部和世界卫生组织共同发起的，国际艾滋病协会也参与协助。
    与会的各国科学家将在大会和各种分组小会上提出５５００余篇研究论文。会议期间将有条款分得很细的分组讨论和讲座。会议组织者认为，虽然不能指望这次会议上就能真正找到医治艾滋病的办法，但是把大家的研究成果汇到一起，并且使科学家们有这样的机会进行交流是十分有益的。
    在今天晚上举行的开幕式上，加拿大总理马尔罗尼和赞比亚总统卡翁达先后发表了讲话，期望会议获得成功。
    据世界卫生组织今年５月初的统计，截至４月底，全球正式艾滋病患者总人数已达１５１７９０人，比１９８８年底增加５２００人，这还不包括５００多万带艾滋病毒者。在艾滋病患者最多的１０个国家中，美国居首位，有８．９５万人，占总人数的５９％，其次是乌干达６０００人，法国５０００人，巴西４４００人，坦桑尼亚３５００人，肯尼亚２７３０人，马拉维２５８０人，西德、意大利和加拿大各为２０００人。
    世界卫生组织提供的数字还表明，艾滋病患者每年都是成倍增长，１９８６年底曾为３．６万人，１９８７年底就达６．８万人，１９８８年底倍增至１３．２万。专家们认为，到本世纪末艾滋病毒将侵袭的人数可能达１０００万人。
    为此，征服艾滋病已成了当今全世界人民的共同任务，而本届大会也颇受各国的重视。第一届艾滋病国际大会是１９８５年在美国亚特兰大市召开的。
