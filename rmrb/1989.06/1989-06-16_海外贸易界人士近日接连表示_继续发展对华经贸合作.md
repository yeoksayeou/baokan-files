	Recently, overseas trade circles have expressed through various means that they will continue to develop economic and trade cooperation with China.

	Today morning, Mr. Ni Youxin, the General Manager of the China Trade Department of Bowron & Co. (Hong Kong), met with Mr. Xu Dayou, Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. He expressed his confidence in continuing friendly trade and economic and technological cooperation with China.

	He said: "Bowron & Co. has a 90-year history of trade relations with China. In the past 10 years, we have seen that China's reform and opening-up policy has achieved good results in developing the economy and improving people's living standards. In another 10 years or even longer, I believe people's lives will be even better. Therefore, whether now or in the future, our attitude is clear: we will not leave China. Although trade in the near term may be affected to some extent, we are not afraid."

	On the afternoon of June 12, Mr. Guo Dongpo, Vice Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, met with Mr. Nakata Yoshio, Executive Director of the Japan External Trade Organization. Nakata came to Beijing specifically to discuss with relevant Chinese parties the resumption of trade and economic and technological cooperation between Chinese and Japanese enterprises as soon as possible.

	During the meeting, Nakata said that he came to China this time for two purposes: to visit and comfort old friends; and to discuss business matters between the two sides.

	He said, "No matter what happens, it should not affect the development of business. We should try to minimize the impact of the turmoil on the development of economic and technological cooperation between the two sides."

	Mr. Jay Perry and Mr. G. Perry, directors of the London Export Company, also sent separate telegrams to Mr. Zheng Hongye, Acting Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, expressing their determination to continue promoting long-term relations between China and the UK.

	On June 12, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade and the China International Chamber of Commerce issued a statement, expressing their determination to overcome current temporary difficulties and continue to develop foreign trade as before. The overseas trade circles have responded quickly to this.

	On June 14, Ms. Pan Mary, Secretary-General of the British China-Britain Trade Association, met with the Chinese representative of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade in the UK. She said that the association considers the statement by the China International Chamber of Commerce and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade to be very important to them. They can use this statement to respond to British manufacturers who have been calling to inquire about the situation in China in recent days. She also said that the plan to hold an exhibition in Beijing in November this year remains unchanged and is still being prepared as usual.

	On June 13, the American Commercial Daily published on the front page the content of the statement issued by the China International Chamber of Commerce and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade. At the same time, it reported the remarks made by Mr. Sullivan, Chairman of the US-China Business Council, to the newspaper. Sullivan believes that American companies should not rush to make any decisions regarding their investments in China, especially export-oriented enterprises, which can continue to operate.
