Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, June 10th.

In recent days, more than 30,000 railway workers and public security officers of the Hangzhou Railway Bureau have overcome numerous difficulties, maintaining a high attendance rate of 98% to 100% to ensure the resumption of transportation on the entire line.

At around 10:00 AM on May 5th, due to several hundred people blocking and sitting on the Qingtai Overpass near Hangzhou Railway Station, and nearly 10,000 people gathering around, railway transportation was disrupted for over 50 hours. A total of 60 passenger trains and 88 freight trains were delayed on the Shanghai-Hangzhou, Zhejiang-Gan, Shaoxing-Ningbo, and Hangzhou-Changsha lines. The more than 200 locomotive personnel and over 1,000 train crew members on these passenger and freight trains, many of whom had been overworked for 20 to 50 hours, continued to work to alleviate the difficulties faced by the tens of thousands of passengers stranded en route. In particular, the locomotive personnel on the trains, despite the scorching heat, remained at their posts ready to receive orders to depart at any moment. Many of these personnel, due to the prolonged stoppage of the trains, were without food or water but remained without complaint. At that time, traffic in the urban area of Hangzhou was also paralyzed due to roadblocks everywhere. Some workers of this bureau left home at 3 to 4 AM, walking 20 to 30 kilometers to arrive at the stations and sections of the Hangzhou Railway Bureau for their early shifts. Many workers had to cross half of Hangzhou City to get from their homes to Hangzhou Station.

Due to the sense of responsibility and voluntary actions of the railway workers, the Hangzhou Railway Bureau's transportation was restored in a timely manner. In recent days, the 60 delayed passenger trains have all departed, and the passenger and freight transportation of the Hangzhou Railway Bureau has basically returned to normal.

　　杭州三万铁路职工
    确保运输畅通无阻
    新华社杭州６月１０日电  连日来，杭州铁路分局３万多铁路员工和公安干警克服重重困难，以高达９８％至１００％的出勤率坚守生产岗位，为恢复全线运输做出了贡献。
    ５日上午１０时多，铁路杭州站附近的清泰立交道口由于几百人设障静坐和近万人围观，造成铁路运输中断达５０多小时，共有６０趟客运列车和８８趟货物列车受阻停留在沪杭、浙赣、肖甬、杭长４条铁路线的途中。在这些客、货列车上执乘的２００多名机务人员和上千名列车乘务员，不少人超劳２０—５０多小时，仍坚持为被困在途中的几万名旅客排忧解难。特别是机车上的机务人员，不顾天气炎热，一直坚守岗位以便随时受命开车；其中不少机务人员因列车停留途中时间过长而断粮断水，仍无怨言。当时，恰逢杭州市区交通也因处处路障而陷入瘫痪，这个分局有些职工半夜３至４点钟离家，步行二三十公里赶到杭州铁路分局的站、段上早班；不少职工从家里到杭州站要穿过半个杭州城。
    由于铁路员工的主人翁责任感和自觉行动保证了杭铁分局运输的及时恢复。近几天受阻的６０辆客车已全部开出，杭州铁路分局的客货运输已基本正常。
