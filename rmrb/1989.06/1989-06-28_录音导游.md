Every museum, historical site, and tourist attraction faces the same challenge: how to help visitors better understand the history of the place? With the advancement of modern science and technology, audio tour guides are becoming an effective tool to address this issue.

Since the introduction of audio tour guides in the United States in 1958, thousands of tourist spots and short-term exhibitions around the world have adopted this service. Many famous museums and tourist destinations, such as the Louvre, the Vatican Museums, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in the United States, the Hong Kong Museum of Art, and the Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site, have all established audio tour guide services. The Palace Museum in China also introduced this service last year.

Audio tour guides use specially designed audio systems for self-service by visitors. Currently, there are two main types of services: tape systems and wireless radio systems. In places that have the first type of system, visitors can rent a specially designed portable tape player and a comfortable headset. They can then carry the player with them, follow the audio guide and map, and listen as they walk, following the directions indicated by the specially designed guide signs. Visitors can turn the machine on and off as needed during their tour and can also rewind to listen again.

The second type of system provides visitors with a small wireless receiver. As visitors enter a specific area, such as a hall, a section of an old city wall, or in front of a famous painting, they can receive detailed introductions about that area through the receiver. These introductions are broadcast by small wireless transmitters placed in that area.

The scripts for audio tour guides are usually drafted by scholars familiar with history, then edited and revised by tour guide experts. They are then recorded by famous artists from different linguistic regions and countries. For example, the Chinese language guide for the Palace Museum was narrated by Ying Ruocheng. Therefore, the explanations in audio tour guides are often vivid and interesting, and the voices are particularly warm and moving, especially when visitors realize that the person narrating is someone they are very familiar with.

　　录音导游
    丁刚
    每一所博物馆，每一座历史遗址，每一处旅游点都面临着一个同样的问题：怎样才能使游客更好地了解这里的历史？随着现代科学技术的发展，录音导游正在成为解决这一问题的有力工具。
    自从一九五八年录音导游在美国问世以来，全世界已经有数千个游览点和短期展览使用了这种服务业务。许多世界著名的博物馆和旅游胜地，像卢浮宫、梵蒂冈博物馆、美国大都会艺术博物馆、香港艺术博物馆、福兰克林·Ｄ·罗斯福故居等都开设了录音导游的业务。我国的故宫博物院也在去年增设了这项业务。
    录音导游是用专门设计的听力系统供游客自我服务的一种导游形式。目前，主要有两种服务方式，一种是录音带系统，一种是无线收音系统。在开设了第一种系统的旅游点，游客可以租到一个特制的导游单放机和一只舒适的耳机，然后把单放机挎在身上，根据导游录音带和导游图，边走边听，按照为录音导游专设的引导牌指引的方向，游完全程。游客在游览中可依据自己的兴趣和需要，随时开关机器，还可以倒带重听。
    第二种系统为游客提供的是一个小型无线电接收机，游客每走进一个区域，比方说一座殿堂、一段旧城墙或一副名画前，他都可以通过接收机收听到有关这个区域的详细介绍，这介绍是由安放在这一区域的小型无线电发射机播出的。
    录音导游使用的导游词大都由熟悉历史的学者们起草，再由导游专家整理、修订，然后交各语种地区和国家的著名艺术家播讲并录制，像故宫博物院的汉语导游词就是由英若诚播讲的。所以，录音导游的解说词往往不仅生动有趣，而且听起来声音也特别亲切感人，尤其是当游客发觉为他讲解的是他十分熟悉的某位艺术家时。
