The county of Changhai, known for the saying "beat the deer with a stick and scoop up fish with a dipper," has once again witnessed the "dipper-fishing" phenomenon this year.

Since April 23, approximately 50 meters of the coastline near the scallop farming site on Wangjia Island has seen catfish swarming towards the shore around 9 PM each night. The average weight of these catfish is over 200 grams, with some reaching nearly half a kilogram.

Local fishermen report that the catfish swarming to the shore is a new phenomenon that emerged after the island began artificial scallop farming. Previously, this had never occurred. It is speculated that this phenomenon is related to scallop farming. Wangjia Island's shallow waters have long been a habitat for catfish, which burrow into the sand during the day and come out at night to feed. The outer walls of the scallop cages have grown some algae and microorganisms, which are periodically scraped off and sink to the seabed, providing a delicious bait for the catfish. In April and May, which is the scallop harvest season on the island, the catfish gather in groups at night, following the scent of the harvested cages to the shore.

### 王家岛再现“瓢舀鱼”奇观

　　王家岛再现“瓢舀鱼”奇观
    俗有“棍打獐子瓢舀鱼”之称的长海县，今年又出现“瓢舀鱼”的奇观。
    从４月２３日开始，这个县的王家岛扇贝养殖场所在地大约有５０米长的海岸上，一到夜间９点左右，就有鲇鱼成群结队扑向滩头，平均体重在２００克以上，大的近半公斤重。
    据当地渔民说，鲇鱼扑滩，是在岛上人工养殖扇贝之后出现的新鲜事，以前从未有过。据分析，这种现象，可能与扇贝养殖有关。王家岛浅海历来有鲇鱼栖息繁衍，这种鱼白天潜入海底沙窝，夜间出来活动、觅食。由于扇贝吊笼外壁生长了一些海藻和微生物，这些海生物不断地被人们刷掉沉入海底，成为鲇鱼的可口饵料。４、５月份，正是岛上扇贝收获季节，鲇鱼便在夜间“拉帮结队”，循着收获上岸的吊笼腥味，向岸边扑来。
