Xinhua News Agency reports:

Some primary schools in Guiyang have established "Little Red Guard Anti-Gambling Teams," advocating for "a clean space for young children," which has drawn the attention of various sectors in Guiyang City.

In recent times, gambling has become prevalent in some urban areas of Guiyang City. Some students influenced by this gambling culture have become undisciplined, and their academic performance has declined. Recently, schools such as Sanqiao Primary School organized the establishment of "Little Red Guard Anti-Gambling Teams," conducting "anti-gambling" propaganda activities both inside and outside the school, calling on all sectors of society to create a healthy environment for students' growth.

The children's appeal has drawn the attention of various sectors in Guiyang. Li Wànlù, Secretary of the Guiyang Municipal Party Committee, called on all Party members and cadres to set a model example. Local street offices, police stations, and stationed armed police dispatched personnel to assist the schools in carrying out these activities. Over 500 student parents, through writing letters or visiting the school, expressed their commitment to setting a good example for their children.

　　贵阳“红领巾”带头禁赌
    据新华社讯  （通讯员何伊经、记者章传根）贵阳一些小学“红领巾禁赌团”呼吁“为少年儿童留一席净土”，引起贵阳市各界的关注。
    近一段时间以来，贵阳市部分市区赌博成风。一些受到赌风影响的学生纪律涣散，学习成绩下降。前不久，市三桥小学等学校组织成立“红领巾禁赌团”，在校内外开展“反赌博”的宣传活动，呼吁社会各界创造一个适合学生健康成长的良好环境。
    孩子们的呼吁引起了贵阳社会各界的关注。中共贵阳市委书记李万禄要求广大党员和干部起模范表率作用。当地街道办事处、派出所和驻地武警指战员派出人员协助学校开展这一活动。５００多名学生家长通过写信或到校拜访，表示要为孩子作出好榜样。
