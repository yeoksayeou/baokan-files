Martial law troops held a solemn flag-raising ceremony at Tiananmen Square this morning.

The neatly arranged Tiananmen Square was guarded by the martial law troops. Military vehicles were neatly lined up. The troops and armed police soldiers stood in formation facing the dawn. At 5:50 AM, the flag-raising ceremony began. The military band played the national anthem, and the five-star red flag slowly rose as the anthem played. The soldiers and armed police officers saluted the national flag.

After the flag-raising ceremony, the General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe and the military band performed for the martial law troops. Peng Liyuan, Kelimu, and others sang "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China," "In the Fields of Hope," and other songs.
