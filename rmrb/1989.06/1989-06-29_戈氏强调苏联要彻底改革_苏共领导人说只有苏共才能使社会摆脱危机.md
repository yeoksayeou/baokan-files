Soviet leader Gorbachev said on June 28 that the Soviet Union is still in the early stages of understanding the essence of socialism and unleashing its potential, and must carry out thorough reforms in the economic, political, legal, and state systems.

He made these remarks during a meeting with visiting General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Chairman of the State Council of the German Democratic Republic, Erich Honecker. Honecker arrived in Moscow on June 27 for a working visit.

According to TASS, Gorbachev pointed out during his talks with Honecker that the reforms currently underway in the Soviet Union are a peaceful revolution aimed at transforming all aspects of social life. He said that in the future, many things will depend on the party's own reforms.

New China News Agency, Moscow, June 27 - Soviet Communist Party Central Committee Politburo member and Secretary Chebrikov today stressed that in the Soviet Union, apart from the Communist Party, there is no other force that can lead society out of the crisis.

Chebrikov made these remarks during a meeting with representatives of the labor collective at the Soviet Ministry of Civil Aviation.

He said that at present, various criticisms of the party have emerged in society, some of which are reasonable, but unfortunately, some are completely groundless attacks. He pointed out that a series of organizations with obvious anti-socialist tendencies are actively inciting social discontent, attempting to create a rift between the party and the working class, youth, and intellectuals. He said that many laborers demand severe measures against those who undermine the party's authority by various means.

He expressed that if power is handed over to those who do not like socialism, yearn for the tsarist regime, and march towards Pushkin Square under the banner of the tsarist empire, then both the people and the party will not agree.

　　戈氏强调苏联要彻底改革
    苏共领导人说只有苏共才能使社会摆脱危机
    新华社莫斯科６月２８日电  苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫２８日说，苏联尚处在认识社会主义本质和发挥社会主义潜力的早期阶段，必须在经济、政治、司法和国家体制方面进行彻底的改革。
    他是在会见来访的德国统一社会党中央总书记、民主德国国务委员会主席昂纳克时说这番话的。昂纳克于２７日抵达莫斯科进行工作访问。
    据塔斯社报道，戈尔巴乔夫在同昂纳克会谈中指出，苏联正在进行的改革是一场和平的革命，旨在对社会生活的各个方面进行改造。而今后，许多事情将取决于党自身的改革。
    新华社莫斯科６月２７日电　苏共中央政治局委员、中央书记切布里科夫今天强调，在苏联除了共产党之外，没有其他力量能够使社会摆脱危机。
    切布里科夫是在苏联民航部会见劳动集体的代表时这样表示的。
    他说，现在社会上出现了各种各样的对党的指责，其中虽然也有合理的批评，但遗憾的是，有些是完全没有根据的攻击。他指出，现在一系列具有明显反社会主义性质的组织，积极地煽动社会不满，企图造成党与工人阶级、青年、知识分子的对立。他说，许多劳动群众要求对以各种手段破坏党的威信的人采取严厉措施。
    他表示，如果把权力给予那些不喜欢社会主义、怀念帝制、打着沙皇帝国旗帜走向普希金广场的人，那么人民和党都是不会答应的。
