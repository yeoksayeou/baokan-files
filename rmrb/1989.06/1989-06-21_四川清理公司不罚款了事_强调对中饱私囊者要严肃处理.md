People's Daily, Chengdu, June 21st.

    Sichuan Governor Zhang Haoruo and Deputy Governor Xie Shijie, after hearing a report on the province's company rectification work, stated that for companies with serious violations of discipline and law, it is not enough to just confiscate or fine them. Further investigation is needed to determine if the company's leaders have embezzled funds or abused their power for personal gain, and these issues should be handled seriously according to policy and law.

    Over the past half year, Sichuan Province has made significant progress in rectification work. The province has already handled 73% of the companies through mergers, separations, and other means, and 2,300-plus party and government officials have resigned from their positions in companies, accounting for 67% of those holding dual roles. Additionally, a number of companies with violations amounting to over 10 million yuan have been uncovered. However, there are still issues such as some bureau and department leaders not paying enough attention to the rectification work, not thoroughly investigating cases, and not strictly implementing policies.

    Regarding these issues, Zhang Haoruo and Xie Shijie emphasized that rectifying economic order and combating corruption in the circulation sector is in line with the broad masses of the people's wishes. All levels of government and relevant leaders must be resolute in their attitudes, speed up the investigation, and promptly handle cases.

　　四川清理公司不罚款了事    
    强调对中饱私囊者要严肃处理
    本报成都６月２１日电  记者罗茂城报道：四川省省长张皓若、副省长谢世杰在听取省政府清理整顿公司工作汇报后说，对严重违纪违法的公司，不能光没收、罚款了事，还应进一步查清企业公司的领导有没有中饱私囊、以权谋私等问题，按照政策法律严肃处理。
    四川省半年多来在清理整顿工作中取得了很大成绩，全省已有７３％的公司作了撤并、脱钩处理，已有２３００余名党政机关干部辞去在公司所兼职务，占兼职人数的６７％。此外，还查出一批违纪金额达百万元以上的公司。但是，在清理整顿公司中，也存在一些厅局的主要领导不够重视，查处案件抓得不紧，执行政策不坚决等问题。
    针对上述问题，张皓若、谢世杰说，整顿经济秩序、整治流通领域的腐败现象，符合广大人民群众的要求，各级政府和有关负责人一要态度坚决，二要抓紧清查，三要及时处理。
