The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Office Spokesperson on This Issue

New China News Agency, Beijing, June 3 - The spokesperson for the Office of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress today issued a statement regarding whether the eighth session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress can be held as scheduled.

The spokesperson said that the eighth session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress was originally scheduled to be held around June 20 in Beijing. The session will discuss several issues of widespread concern to the people to supervise the government's work improvements. To ensure the success of this session, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and relevant departments of the State Council have been actively preparing for various aspects.

He said that to successfully hold this session, a stable and orderly environment is necessary. It is well known that the Great Hall of the People is the venue for the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress to hold its sessions. Currently, some university students from Beijing and other provinces who have come to Beijing are holding a sit-in protest at the East Gate of the Great Hall of the People in Tiananmen Square day and night. The square is in a state of disorder, with constant noise. Public order and public safety are not guaranteed. Under these circumstances, holding a session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress in the nearby meeting hall will be seriously disrupted and will be difficult to conduct normally. It will be very difficult to hold the session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress as scheduled and complete the intended tasks.

    人大常委会会议能否如期召开？
    人大常委会办公厅新闻发言人就此问题发表谈话
    新华社北京6月3日电  全国人大常委会办公厅新闻发言人今天就全国人大常委会第八次会议能否如期召开问题发表谈话。
    这位发言人说，七届全国人大常委会第八次会议原定于6月20日左右在北京举行，将讨论人民群众普遍关心的几个问题，以督促政府改进工作。为了开好这次会议，全国人大常委会和国务院的有关部门积极进行了各项准备工作。
    他说，要开好这次会议，必须有一个安定和有秩序的环境。众所周知，人民大会堂是全国人大常委会举行会议的地方。现在北京市和外地来京的部分高等学校学生，在人民大会堂东门外天安门广场日夜静坐请愿。广场秩序混乱不堪，喧嚣之声，不绝于耳。公共秩序、公共安全得不到保障。这种情况下，在近在咫尺的全国人大常委会会议厅举行会议，将受到严重干扰，很难正常进行，要如期召开全国人大常委会会议，完成预期任务，是很困难的。
