In mid-April, the mountains around Lhasa were still covered with snow, and the nighttime temperature in the city usually dropped to minus 10 degrees Celsius. However, the soldiers stationed in Lhasa to maintain order were living in tents that were open on all sides. They posted a slogan in their camp: "For the happiness and peace of the people of Lhasa, we endure wind and rain with sweet hearts!"

One night, during a heavy snowstorm, an elderly Tibetan man named Dunzhu came to a tent and saw that the soldiers' blankets and pillows were covered with straw and dirt. He choked up and said, "How can you sleep like this? My home can accommodate seven or eight of you. Come with me!" After much polite refusal, the soldiers still declined Dunzhu's offer.

At the famous Sera Monastery, the monks saw the soldiers shivering in their tents and offered to let a certain battalion move into their living quarters. The soldiers politely declined, saying, "We have orders not to stay in monasteries, and we cannot disobey." The monks then bought electrical wires and connected power from the monastery to some of the tents, allowing the soldiers to use electric heaters to keep warm.

The Tibet Autonomous Region Statistics Bureau, the Municipal Health and Quarantine Station, the Municipal Post and Telecommunications Bureau, the Municipal Petroleum Company, and more than 30 other units quickly cleared out over 5,000 square meters of office space, conference rooms, dance halls, canteens, guest rooms, and other public buildings within a week. The soldiers insisted on not moving, so many employees from these units came in groups to "seize" the blankets for them.

Soon, more than 10 units placed public television sets in the rooms where the soldiers were staying. At least seven employees brought their home TVs to the soldiers' rooms for them to watch programs. A young couple who had just been married for three days carried a Mu Dan brand color TV to the soldiers' room. The bride said, "We just bought this TV a few days ago, and the picture quality is quite good. You can use it first!"

Some government officials voluntarily served as translators for the martial law troops. Three teachers from the Fifth Middle School used their free time to teach a Tibetan language night school for the soldiers, teaching them daily life and necessary Tibetan phrases for duty. Many government officials and school teachers gave supplementary classes to soldiers attending adult education, night school, and correspondence courses, so they could miss fewer classes while on duty.

On the streets of Lhasa, we often saw scenes that moved us: groups of elderly Tibetan men and women with canes, teams of young Tibetan men and women dressed in red and green, carrying qingke (highland barley) wine, butter tea, cigarettes, melon seeds, and candies, coming to the checkpoints to give them to the soldiers on duty.

One evening, it was snowing heavily, and the temperature had dropped to minus 14 degrees Celsius. An old woman named Zhuoxini Ma, who lived on Beijing Dong Road, carried a bundle of firewood and a pot of steaming butter tea to a checkpoint near her home. She poured a large bowl for each soldier and wanted to start a fire to warm them up. The soldiers drank the tea but patiently explained to the old woman that they couldn't start a fire near the checkpoint. The old woman then took the soldiers' hands and rubbed them to warm them up.

Many students from Tibet University and other schools organized themselves, pushing carts with thermos bottles to patrol between some checkpoints, delivering hot sweet tea to the soldiers.

The martial law troops had been stationed in Lhasa for a long time and had not been able to eat fresh vegetables, causing some soldiers' lips to crack. More than ten Tibetan villagers from the No. 1 Agricultural Farm in the western suburbs sent celery and bok choy, which they had grown in greenhouses and were reluctant to pick even for themselves, to the army canteen.

An old soldier from the troops said, "In 1951, when I entered Tibet with the main force, the Tibetan people welcomed and supported the PLA in this way; nearly 40 years have passed, and their deep affection for the soldiers has not changed at all!"

　　日光城里鱼水情
    罗同松　王黎红　秦光龙
    ４月中旬的拉萨，周围山顶依然白雪皑皑，市区夜间气温一般都在零下１０摄氏度。然而，在这里执行戒严任务的官兵，却坚持住在四面透风的帐篷里。他们在营地贴了这样的标语：“为了拉萨人民的幸福与安宁，风餐露宿心也甜！”
    一天深夜，风雪交加，藏族阿爹顿珠来到一座帐篷，见战士们的被子、枕头上落了许多茅草和泥土，便哽咽着说：“这怎么能过夜？我家挤你们七八个人没问题，走吧！”经过好一番谦让，战士们还是婉言谢绝了阿爹的邀请。
    在蜚声中外的色拉寺，喇嘛们见战士在帐篷里受冻，便腾出住房要某部一营搬进去住。官兵们千推万谢，说：“不住寺庙，是我们的纪律，不能违犯啊！”于是，喇嘛们买来电线，从寺里接通电源到一些帐篷，让战士们用电炉取暖。
    西藏自治区统计局、市卫生防疫站、市邮电局、市石油公司等３０多个单位，不到一周时间，便腾出办公室、会议室、舞厅、食堂、招待所以及诸如此类的公房５０００多平方米。战士们坚持不搬，许多单位的职工便成群结队到帐篷里去“抢”被包。
    接着，又有１０多个单位，将公用电视机摆在了战士们住的房间里。至少有７位职工将家里的电视机搬来给战士们收看节目。一对结婚才３天的年轻夫妇抬着牡丹牌彩色电视机来到战士们住的房间，新娘说：“这电视机头几天才买的，效果还不错，你们先使着吧！”
    一些机关干部，主动为戒严部队充当翻译。第五中学的３位教师利用休息时间，义务为战士们办了藏语夜校，教给战士们日常生活特别是执勤中需用的藏语。许多机关干部和学校老师，为上夜大、电大、函大的官兵补课，使他们在执行戒严任务时尽量少缺些课。
    在拉萨街头，我们常常为这样一些场面所激动：一群群拄着拐杖的藏族阿爹和阿妈，一队队穿红着绿的藏族姑娘和小伙子，提着青稞酒，捧着酥油茶，拿着香烟、瓜子和糖果，来到路口哨位，献给执勤的官兵。
    一天晚上，天空飘着鹅毛大雪，温度已经是零下１４摄氏度。北京东路一位名叫卓西尼玛的老大娘抱着一捆干柴，提着热腾腾的酥油茶来到离家不远的哨位，给每位战士斟了一大碗，还要生火给战士取暖。战士们喝了茶，但是耐心给阿妈说明了哨位旁边不能生火的理由。阿妈就拉起战士的手来搓揉，以此生热。
    西藏大学以及其他院校的许多学生组织起来，用小车推着保温桶巡回于一些哨位之间，将热乎乎的甜茶送到战士们的手中。
    戒严部队进驻拉萨市，长时间吃不上新鲜蔬菜，有的战士嘴唇干裂。西郊八一农场１０多位藏族群众将温室里种的，连自家人也舍不得轻易采摘的芹菜、小白菜送到部队伙房。
    部队一位老军人说：“１９５１年我随大部队进藏时，藏族群众就是这样欢迎和支持解放军的；快４０年了，他们热爱子弟兵的深情厚谊丝毫没有改变！”
