European Football's Three Major Cup Winners

**Champions Cup: AC Milan**

The AC Milan football club was established on December 15, 1899. It has won the Italian league championship 11 times and the European Club Champions Cup twice. In the summer of 1987, AC Milan spent $8.5 million to acquire Dutch stars Ruud Gullit and Marco van Basten. For the club's owner, Silvio Berlusconi, who has $2.5 billion, this investment was quite profitable. In this year's European Champions Cup semi-finals, AC Milan drew with Spain's Real Madrid in front of 100,000 spectators and 500 million television viewers. Upon returning to their home ground, they defeated the opposition 5-0. In the final, AC Milan defeated Romania's Steaua Bucharest 4-0, with the two Dutch stars scoring the goals. This victory earned AC Milan the right to participate in the Toyota Cup for the first time.

**Cup Winners' Cup: Barcelona**

In 1899, Swiss national Hans Gamper became the founder of the Spanish football club Barcelona. Over the past decade, stars such as the Dutch players Johan Cruyff and Johan Neeskens, Argentine Diego Maradona, Englishman Gary Lineker, West German Bernd Schuster, and two famous coaches, Dutchman Rinus Michels and Argentine César Luis Menotti, have all played for this team. In 1979 and 1982, the team won the European Cup Winners' Cup twice. Due to the knockout format used in various national cup competitions, where the level of competition is not divided, the outcome is often unpredictable. Therefore, it is not uncommon for second-tier teams to win the Cup Winners' Cup.

**UEFA Cup: Napoli**

The Italian football club Napoli was established in 1926. However, it was not until two years ago that they tasted the sweetness of winning the Italian Serie A championship. At that time, Diego Maradona vowed to turn Napoli around and achieve the team's 61-year dream of winning the championship. In this year's UEFA Cup final, Napoli defeated West Germany's Stuttgart 2-1. Maradona's handball was protected by the Greek referee, and Stuttgart was penalized for a foul. The Italian fans' firecrackers added to the chaos. Ultimately, the Germans could not stop Napoli from winning on their home turf, despite their dissatisfaction.

　　欧洲足球三大杯得主
    冠军杯：ＡＣ米兰队
    意大利ＡＣ米兰俱乐部队成立于１８９９年１２月１５日，曾１１次获得意大利联赛冠军，两次夺得欧洲俱乐部冠军杯。１９８７年夏季，ＡＣ米兰队以８５０万美元的巨资，买到荷兰球星路德·古力特和范·巴斯滕，对拥有２５亿美元的俱乐部老板贝尔鲁斯科尼来说，这笔投资相当划算。本届欧洲冠军杯半决赛，ＡＣ米兰队当着１０万现场球迷和５亿电视观众，客场逼和西班牙皇家马德里队，回到主场竟以５∶０狂胜对手。决赛中，ＡＣ米兰队又以４∶０的绝对优势制服了罗马尼亚布加勒斯特“星”队，进球的功臣正是两位荷兰籍球星。这一胜利使ＡＣ米兰队第一次获得参加丰田杯赛资格。
    　　　　优胜者杯：巴塞罗那队
    １８９９年，瑞士的汉斯·甘佩尔成了西班牙巴塞罗那俱乐部队创始人。近十几年当中，先后为该队效力的球星有荷兰的克鲁伊夫和内斯肯斯、阿根廷的马拉多纳、英国的莱因克尔、西德的舒斯特以及两位著名教练荷兰的米歇尔斯和阿根廷的梅诺蒂。１９７９年和１９８２年，该队两次在欧洲俱乐部优胜者杯赛上夺魁。由于各国杯赛采用不分级别的淘汰制，胜负偶然性大，二流球队夺得优胜者杯的情况常有所见。
    　　　　联盟杯：那不勒斯队
    意大利那不勒斯俱乐部队成立于１９２６年，但是，直到两年前，它还没有尝过意大利甲级联赛冠军的滋味。这时，马拉多纳发誓要使那不勒斯队打一个翻身仗，实现这支球队６１年梦寐以求的夺魁理想。本届欧洲足球协会联盟杯决赛，那不勒斯队２∶１战胜西德斯图加特队。马拉多纳一次手球受到希腊主裁判的“保护”，西德队反倒受定位球的惩罚。意大利观众的爆竹更推波助澜。西德人最终未能在本土上阻止那不勒斯队夺冠，尽管他们很不服气。　　　　　张朝明
