Only Belongs to Women's Beauty

Among today's youth, there is a popular saying: "The feminine is dominant, the masculine is weak." The Chinese women's volleyball team has shocked the world, and in life, there are "wife-controlled husbands" and "kneeling at the bedside." It is no wonder that some men lament: "There are no women in China."

I understand their meaning: While men praise women for their outstanding achievements in various fields of society, they complain that modern Chinese women lack some tenderness and virtue.

The reason lies in the fact that women's economic status in modern families has improved, making the dependent relationship between wives and husbands disappear. Traditional women could not participate in social work and had no independent income, so they had to depend on their husbands. A husband's misfortune meant the loss of her ability to survive. Therefore, the value of traditional women could only be reflected in being a good wife and mother. Modern women, however, are different. They have jobs and independent economic sources, their lives are secure, and their value is recognized not only by their husbands but also by society. Thus, they have less submissiveness and more self-confidence. "I earn as much money as you do, why should I serve you!"

Moreover, modern women play multiple roles in life, which also makes them "unfeminine." Every day, they work for 8 hours like men, earning money; when they return home, they immediately change roles, becoming wives and mothers, buying groceries, cooking, washing clothes, and managing the household. If they encounter something unpleasant, their "role transition" will have a masculine shadow. I have a female friend who, before marriage, was as gentle as a little bird. Recently, she took her child to the doctor, and due to a small incident, she had an argument with someone. The other person's remark of "shrew" shocked her, and later she sadly asked me, "Yanzi, have I changed?" I was speechless, but I knew clearly: it was the heavy burden of life that changed her.

Facing the current "crisis" of "women not being feminine" in China, in addition to hoping that men will have more understanding and support, I believe that Chinese women should strengthen their self-cultivation and understanding of life. A perfect life is not just about career success, but also about the happiness of life. A gentle personality, delicate emotions, and virtuous actions are the unique charm of women, and also a kind of beauty, a beauty unique to women, beautiful like water, flowing and gentle. This beauty will make a woman's career more complete and fulfilling.

### 只属于女人的美

　　只属于女人的美
    夏燕
    在当今青年中流行着一句话，叫做“阴盛阳衰”。中国女排威震四海，生活中有“妻管严”、“床头跪”。无怪有些男士哀叹：中国没有女人了。
    我深明其意：男士们在赞叹女人在社会各领域取得优异成绩的同时，他们埋怨现代中国女性身上少了点温柔和贤惠。
    究其原因，女性在现代家庭中经济地位的提高，使妻子对丈夫的依附关系消失了。传统的女性不能参与社会工作，没有独立的经济收入，他们必须依附丈夫。丈夫的倒霉，意味着她生存能力的丧失。因此，传统女性的价值只能体现在做贤妻良母上。而现代女性则不同，有工作，有独立的经济来源，生活有保障，自身的价值不仅在丈夫面前，同时也在社会面前得到承认。这样，她们便少了一分依顺，多了一分自信。“我拿的钱一分不比你少，凭什么要侍候你！”
    其次，现代女性在生活中扮演着多种“角色”，也使“女性不女”了。每天８小时要像男人那样工作，挣钱；回到家立刻换装，变成妻子，变成母亲，买菜做饭，洗衣理家。若遇到不顺心的事，“角色转换”便有了男人的影子。我有一个女朋友，结婚前像只轻柔的小鸟，前不久她带孩子看病，因一点小事与人发生争执，对方的一句“泼妇”令她震惊，事后她伤心地问我：“燕子，我变了吗？”我无言以对，心里却清楚：是繁重的生活改变了她。
    面对当今中国“女人不女”的“危机”，除了希望男士多一分理解、助力外，我认为中国女性应加强自身修养和对人生的理解。美满的人生不仅仅是事业的成功，还应加上生活的幸福。温柔的性格，细腻的情感，贤惠的行动，是女人特有的魅力，也是一种美，一种只属于女人的美，美得像水，潺潺的，柔柔的。这种美，将使女人的事业更加完满和充实。
