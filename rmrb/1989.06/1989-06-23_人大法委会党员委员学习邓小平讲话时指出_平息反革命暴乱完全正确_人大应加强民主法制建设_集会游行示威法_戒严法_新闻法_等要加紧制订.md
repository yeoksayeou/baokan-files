Members of the Standing Committee of the NPC Legal Affairs Committee Study Deng Xiaoping's Speech, Affirming the Suppression of the Counter-Revolutionary Rebellion as Completely Correct and Calling for Strengthening Democratic and Legal Construction

According to information provided by relevant departments of the National People's Congress, members of the Standing Committee of the NPC Legal Affairs Committee who are Communist Party members studied Deng Xiaoping's speech during his meeting with senior military officers of the Beijing martial law troops on June 15 and 16. They unanimously agreed that this speech is a programmatic document for unifying the thoughts of the entire Party and the people of the country, guiding us to achieve a complete victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital, and continuing to advance along the line opened by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee.

The attendees discussed that, as Deng Xiaoping pointed out, this turmoil was bound to happen. It was determined by the international and domestic environments, and was not something that could be changed by people's will. In recent years, internationally, there has been a trend suggesting that the "specter of communism" is gradually disappearing, that the construction of socialist countries has not been successful, and that Marxism is no longer effective. Most socialist countries are undergoing reforms, and there are international forces that are sparing no effort to induce these countries to deviate from the socialist path and join the capitalist republics. Domestically, in recent years, some people have echoed the hostile forces abroad, using the opportunities of emancipating the mind and reform and opening up to vigorously advocate bourgeois liberalization. Coupled with the Party's weak leadership in the ideological realm, bourgeois liberalization has spread in the political, ideological, and cultural spheres, ultimately leading to this counter-revolutionary rebellion. The facts clearly show that the purpose of this turmoil, instigated by a small number of people, is to overthrow the Communist Party and the socialist system, and to establish a completely Westernized bourgeois republic. This is a serious political struggle of life and death. The Party Central Committee and the State Council made a decisive decision to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital, which is completely correct.

The attendees pointed out that many lessons can be learned from this turmoil: (1) We lack consistency in emphasizing the Four Cardinal Principles, and the struggle against bourgeois liberalization and the elimination of spiritual pollution has not been sustained, causing confusion in the people's minds. Comrade Xiaoping said that the nature of this incident is the opposition between bourgeois liberalization and the Four Cardinal Principles, which is indeed to the point. (2) Due to the spread of bourgeois liberalization, the Party's leadership has been severely weakened. In recent years, the position and role of Party organizations have declined, many grassroots Party organizations have become paralyzed or semi-paralyzed, and certain liberal tendencies and corrupt practices within the Party have not been timely rectified and corrected. The democratic centralism and organizational discipline within the Party have been weakened, which has made the Party less strong and powerful in countering the challenges from a few bad elements, and has also reduced the Party's prestige among the people, affecting the Party's ability to unite the people. The lessons are profound. (3) Comrade Xiaoping pointed out that the biggest mistake in the past decade is education, mainly ideological and political education, which hits the nail on the head. For a long time, we have not emphasized Marxism-Leninism, revolutionary traditions, or class struggle, as if the world is really full of love. However, those who have long insisted on bourgeois liberalization have never relaxed their struggle with us for the younger generation. They spread bourgeois egoism, advocate the pursuit of money, and promote bourgeois democratic and free thought and lifestyle, attempting to achieve their dream of turning China into a bourgeois republic through peaceful evolution. We must not be complacent and must do a good job in ideological education for young people to thoroughly smash the dreams of some bourgeois elements. This is a major issue concerning the fate of the country and the nation.

The attendees expressed that Comrade Xiaoping's speech clearly affirmed that in political system reform, we must adhere to the system of people's congresses, which feels very close to us and has strengthened our confidence in doing a good job in the work of the people's congresses. Everyone pointed out that the system of people's congresses is our fundamental political system, which is written into the constitution and has proven effective. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, especially since the Sixth National People's Congress, the system of people's congresses has been strengthened, and the status and role of people's congresses at all levels in national political life have become increasingly important, contributing to the construction of socialist democracy and the improvement of socialist legal system. However, it must also be seen that this system has not been well implemented and is still not perfect. For example, supervision is very insufficient. Improving the system of people's congresses is a long-term task in political system reform, and those working in the people's congresses should clarify their responsibilities and make unremitting efforts for this.

Everyone believes that Comrade Xiaoping pointed out that the series of lines, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee must be firmly carried out, and one of the important contents is to develop socialist democracy and improve socialist legal system, which is the fundamental task of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and the main task of the Legal Affairs Committee. We should strive to strengthen this aspect of work, especially this struggle has put forward some important tasks for our legal system construction, the Legal Affairs Committee should seriously study them, such as the "Law on Assemblies, Processions, and Demonstrations," "Martial Law Law," "Press Law," "Publication Law," "Association Law," etc., which should be studied and formulated as soon as possible. In addition, this turmoil exposed that our legal education is still weak, and many people do not know the law or are not familiar with it, giving a few bad elements the opportunity to take advantage. How to improve the legal awareness and legal concept of the whole nation is still a long-term task. Some committee members emphasized that we must fully use legal weapons to severely, swiftly, and strictly punish counter-revolutionary rebels and criminals who engage in arson, looting, and murder, and not tolerate them, otherwise the harm will be endless.

The committee members also hope that the Party and the government will seriously summarize the experience and lessons, while cracking down on a few bad elements and completely suppressing the rebellion, they should also pay attention to correcting their own mistakes. In cracking down on corruption, rectifying "official profiteering," stabilizing prices, doing a good job in rectification and adjustment, and carrying out political system reform, building socialist democracy and legal system, they should do some solid work and improve the Party's prestige among the people.

The attendees unanimously suggested that to commemorate the historical merits of the People's Liberation Army in this struggle, to educate young people on revolutionary traditions, to make the whole people remember the bloody lessons, and to prevent the recurrence of historical tragedies, it is appropriate to build a "memorial" for the martyrs of the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the public security officers who sacrificed their lives in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion at an appropriate time.

The main committee member Wang Hanbin, deputy committee members Gu Ming, Lin Jianqing, Xiang Chunyi, Jiang Ping, and 14 other committee members and 4 advisors participated in the study and discussion.

### 人大法委会党员委员学习邓小平讲话时指出  平息反革命暴乱完全正确  人大应加强民主法制建设  “集会游行示威法”“戒严法”“新闻法”等要加紧制订

　　人大法委会党员委员学习邓小平讲话时指出    
    平息反革命暴乱完全正确  人大应加强民主法制建设
    “集会游行示威法”“戒严法”“新闻法”等要加紧制订
    新华社北京６月２３日电　据全国人大有关部门提供的消息：全国人大法律委员会的党员委员于６月１５日和１６日认真学习了邓小平同志接见首都戒严部队军以上干部时的讲话，一致认为，这个讲话是统一全党和全国人民思想，指导我们夺取平息首都反革命暴乱的全胜，沿着党的十一届三中全会开创的路线继续前进的纲领性文件。
    与会委员谈到，正如邓小平同志深刻指出的那样，这场风波是迟早要来的，这是国际的大气候和国内的小气候决定的，是不以人们的意志为转移的。这几年，国际上有那么一股风，说共产主义的“幽灵”正在逐渐消失，社会主义国家的建设都不成功，马克思主义不灵了。大多数社会主义国家在改革，国际上有股势力不遗余力地诱使这些国家背离社会主义道路而纳入资产阶级共和国的轨道。从国内看，这几年有些人和国外的敌对势力遥相呼应，借解放思想、改革开放之机，大肆鼓吹资产阶级自由化，加上党在意识形态领域的领导不力，致使资产阶级自由化在政治思想文化领域泛滥，最终酿成这场反革命暴乱。事实清楚地表明，极少数人挑起的这场动乱，根本目的就是要打倒共产党、推翻社会主义制度，建立一个完全西方化的资产阶级共和国。这是一场严重的、生死存亡的政治斗争。党中央、国务院果断决策，一举平息发生在首都的反革命暴乱，是完全正确的。
    与会委员指出，通过这场风波，有许多经验教训值得吸取：（一）我们在强调坚持四项基本原则方面缺乏一贯性，反对资产阶级自由化、清除精神污染的斗争没能坚持抓下去，在人民中造成了思想混乱。小平同志说，这次事件的性质，就是资产阶级自由化和四个坚持的对立，真是一针见血。（二）由于资产阶级自由化泛滥，党的领导受到严重削弱。这些年党组织的地位和作用下降，不少基层党组织陷于瘫痪、半瘫痪，党内存在的某些自由化倾向、腐败现象等问题得不到及时的克服和纠正，党内民主集中制的生活制度和组织纪律性受到削弱，这些都使党在反击少数坏人的挑战中不够坚强有力，也使党在群众中的威信下降，影响了党对群众的凝聚力，教训是深刻的。（三）小平同志指出，十年最大的失误是教育，主要是思想政治教育，这就抓住了关键。很长时间以来，我们不讲马列、不讲革命优良传统，不讲阶级斗争，似乎世界真的已经“充满了爱”，而长期坚持资产阶级自由化的人却从来没有放松和我们争夺青年一代的斗争，他们散布资产阶级利己主义，鼓吹一切向钱看，宣扬资产阶级民主自由思想和生活方式，妄图通过和平演变来实现他们把中国变成资产阶级共和国的梦想。我们绝不能再等闲视之，必须做好青少年思想教育工作，彻底粉碎资产阶级某些人的梦想，这是关系国家民族命运的大事。
    与会委员表示，小平同志讲话中明确肯定了在政治体制改革方面必须坚持实行人民代表大会制度，感到非常亲切，增强了做好人大工作的信心。大家指出，人民代表大会制度是我国根本的政治制度，是写入宪法的，也是行之有效的。党的十一届三中全会以来，特别是第六届全国人大以来，人民代表大会制度得到加强，各级人民代表大会在国家政治生活中的地位和作用越来越重要，为建设社会主义民主政治、健全社会主义法制作出了贡献。但是，也要看到这一制度还没有很好贯彻执行，也还不够完善，比如在监督方面就很不够，完善人大制度是政治体制改革中一项长期任务，在人大工作的同志要明确责任，为此做出不懈的努力。
    大家认为，小平同志指出党的十一届三中全会以来的一系列路线、方针、政策都要坚定不移地干下去，其中一项很重要的内容就是发展社会主义民主，健全社会主义法制，这是全国人大常委会的根本任务，也是法律委员会主要的任务，我们应该努力加强这方面的工作，特别是这场斗争给我们的法制建设提出了一些重要的课题，法律委员会应认真研究，如“集会游行示威法”、“戒严法”、“新闻法”、“出版法”、“结社法”等，应当抓紧研究制订。另外，这次学潮暴露了我们的法制教育仍然薄弱，许多人不懂法或不很熟悉法律，给极少数坏人钻了空子，如何提高全民的法律意识和法制观念还是一项长期的任务。有些委员强调提出，一定要充分运用法律武器依法从重、从快、从严惩处反革命暴乱分子和搞打砸抢烧杀的刑事犯罪分子，绝不姑息养奸，否则贻害无穷。
    委员们还希望党和政府认真总结经验教训，在打击少数坏人、彻底平息暴乱的同时，也要注意克服和纠正自身的失误，在克服腐败、整治“官倒”、稳定物价、搞好治理整顿以及开展政治体制改革，建设社会主义民主、法制方面扎扎实实地做些实事，提高党在群众中的威信。
    与会委员一致建议，为了铭记人民解放军在这场斗争中的历史功绩，对青少年进行革命传统教育，使全体人民牢记血的教训，防止历史悲剧的重演，在适当的时候，为这次平息反革命暴乱牺牲的人民解放军、武警和公安干警建立“纪念碑”。
    法律委员会主任委员王汉斌、副主任委员顾明、林涧清、项淳一、江平等１４位委员、４位顾问参加了学习和讨论。
