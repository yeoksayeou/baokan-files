Rumors of dead students returning to school debunk "Tiananmen Massacre" rumors in Ningxia

New China News Agency, Yinchuan, June 16th: Rumors that several university students who were said to have died in the Tiananmen Square clearing operation have returned to school safely, have debunked some rumors.

In late May, over 30 students from Ningxia University and Ningxia Institute of Technology went to Beijing to participate in the sit-in at Tiananmen Square. From June 4th to 6th, rumors of a "Tiananmen Massacre" spread in Ningxia, naming three students from Ningxia University as having died in the clearing operation. On June 6th, over 4,000 students from various universities in Ningxia held a mourning march in Yinchuan, with some people emotionally describing the deaths of students in the clearing, which stirred up strong emotions among many people. However, as the students who went to Beijing returned one by one, the so-called three "martyrs," except for one whose family is in Beijing and has not returned, the other two returned to school on the 7th and 8th respectively. Their "resurrection" caused a strong reaction among the students. The facts show that some people with ulterior motives were deliberately spreading rumors.

　　谣传死去的大学生安然返校
    “血洗天安门”谣言在宁夏不攻自破
    新华社银川６月１６日电  宁夏传闻死于天安门广场清场中的几位大学生近日安然返校，使一些谣言不攻自破。
    ５月下旬，宁夏大学、宁夏工学院有３０多名学生赴京参加天安门广场的静坐活动。６月４日至６日，宁夏风传“血洗天安门”的谣言，并指名道姓地传言宁大３名学生在天安门广场清场中死亡。６月６日，宁夏各高校４０００余名学生在银川举行追悼游行，有人声泪俱下地描述学生死于清场的情景，使许多人情绪激动。然而，赴京学生相继返回，所谓３名“死难者”除一人家在北京未回来外，其他两人分别于７、８两日返回学校。他们的“死而复生”在学生中引起强烈反响。事实说明，是一些别有用心的人在有意造谣。
