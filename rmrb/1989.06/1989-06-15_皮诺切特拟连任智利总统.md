Pinochet Considers Running for Re-election as Chilean President

	Xinhua News Agency, Santiago, June 14 — Chilean President Pinochet said on June 14 that if the people demand it, he might accept to run as a candidate for the next presidential election to be held in December this year.

	Previously, Pinochet had repeatedly stated that after handing over presidential power in March 1990, he would continue to serve as the commander-in-chief of the armed forces but would not run as a candidate in the presidential election.

	Pinochet came to power through a coup in 1973. Last October 5, Chile held a national referendum on whether to approve his re-election as president. Although Pinochet's attempt to secure re-election was rejected, his supporters have been actively working to put him forward again as a presidential candidate for the December election this year.

　　皮诺切特拟连任智利总统
    新华社圣地亚哥６月１４日电  智利总统皮诺切特１４日对新闻界表示，“如果人民要求”他作为下届总统候选人，他将“可能接受”，以参加今年１２月举行的大选。
    在此之前，皮诺切特曾多次表示，在１９９０年３月交出总统权力以后，他将继续担任武装部队总司令，但不作为总统候选人参加大选。
    皮诺切特是在１９７３年发动政变上台的。去年１０月５日，智利就是否同意他连任下届总统问题举行了全国公民投票。虽然皮诺切特连任总统的企图被否决，但他的支持者们却仍在积极活动，试图再次推出皮诺切特以总统候选人身份参加今年１２月举行的大选。
