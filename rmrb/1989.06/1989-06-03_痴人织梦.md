The Dream Weaver

**Dreams**

In a small room, two spirits are confined. Colorful dreams entwine the two spirits. The allure of history and the future has captured the two spirits.

This is the true essence of our national heritage. The magnificent and splendid series of traditional costumes of the various ethnic groups in China are being created one by one… The colors, patterns, and decorations on them radiate the sun, moon, stars, blue sky, green sea, flying birds, walking beasts, as well as the golden dragon, jade phoenix, human-faced snakes, and even the entire vast universe, dreams, and illusions. Everything swirls and dances around their agile fingertips. Thus, the stirrings of life and the quintessence of five thousand years of Chinese civilization burst forth from their blood, flowing and splashing through their fingertips, filling this tiny room with a radiant glow, illuminating their two hearts with a brilliant and tender light. The room contains only two beds and a few bowls, and the remaining space is crowded with fragments of unstitched dreams.

This is all the "wealth" that Chinese intellectuals possess—hardship in reality and splendor in dreams, and of course, love.

This dream makes him and her float as if in a trance, almost forgetting the mundane world. After a long conversation, I felt sad for them. The information age that Toffler and others enthusiastically discuss often becomes distorted when it enters China—good news doesn't spread, but bad news travels far. For example, how many people know about this good news? In the depths of the green trees at the Shanghai Theatre Academy, this cramped workshop, these two steadfast hearts, these two foreheads with deep wrinkles and silvered hair, have been working silently for years, completely oblivious to the passage of night and day at the window, using their frail lives as the price. Associate Professor Wang Fushi and his wife Ying Yulan are diligently creating a series of traditional costumes for the various ethnic groups in China.

People, do not underestimate your clothing!

Since humans parted ways with apes, they wandered for a long time wearing animal skins and leaves. In a certain early winter, when a great inventor used a bone needle to sew the first "clothes," the art of clothing, which had endured countless changes, became a treasure of human culture. Every ethnic group's mode of production, customs, religious rituals, geographical environment, climate, artistic traditions, demeanor, and even their views on the universe and their bewilderment about natural forces are all reflected in their clothing. It can be said that a history of clothing is a history of human cultural development. No wonder Françis so passionately advocated for the art of clothing: "If I die and a hundred years later I can still choose a book from the bookstores, what do you think I would choose?... I would not choose novels or similar historical works. Friend, I would unhesitatingly choose a fashion magazine to see the women's clothing of the century after my death. It would show me more about the future of human civilization than all the philosophers, novelists, prophets, and scholars could tell me."

As for the art of Chinese clothing, not to mention the splendid and dazzling changes in clothing from various dynasties and classes, even the clothing of the 56 ethnic groups in China today, with their diverse styles, vibrant colors, and profound cultural connotations, is rarely seen in the world.

Wang Fushi lowered his massive head, tightly clenched his fist, and then raised his head with a fierce gaze. Whenever he faced a major event or a difficult situation, he would habitually make this gesture, like a tiger crouching before leaping. At this moment, Ying Yulan knew he had made up his mind. "What, are we doing it?" "Do it!" he exclaimed. Oh, this unprecedented task has countless foreseen and unforeseen difficulties! Even at an old age, he still relies on the passion and vigor of an artist. Ying Yulan softly sighed.

In the 1950s, while studying at the Shanghai Theatre Academy's makeup specialty class, the Soviet expert Lesli, who came to teach, pointed to the elegant and serene Ying Yulan and said, "She will be China's best makeup artist in the future!" When talking about the rebellious and free-spirited Wang Fushi, who painted with a wild brush, he smiled slyly: "This guy is unpredictable. He is too bold, like a tiger." Love is often a complement. The delicate and weak Yulan and the fierce "tiger" combined, and their makeup skills wonderfully crystallized—surpassing the level of "skill" and entering the realm of "Dao," both becoming famous makeup artists in China today. The arrangement of lines, the composition of faces, and the depiction of forms all coalesce into a dynamic visual art image in their artistic thoughts. Invited to be the makeup designer for the grand musical "The Song of the Chinese Revolution," Wang Fushi created the images of Mao Zedong in 1921, 1927, 1945, and 1949 with astonishing realism, making many who had worked with Mao Zedong marvel.

In recent years, Wang Fushi's heart has wandered, freely roaming in the artistic currents of his field, and unexpectedly fell in love with the art of Chinese clothing in the vast mist of traditional culture. Ying Yulan, who had been together for decades, also followed suit. The two lovers were swallowed up.

It is embarrassing to say that it was a Japanese consortium that played the role of the money angel. Their business acumen allowed Wang Fushi's dream to be realized. This consortium, which operates high-end Japanese kimonos in Shanghai, decided to showcase Chinese ethnic clothing in Japan to prove that their kimonos, produced in China, would be outstanding. They wanted to fund the purchase of a complete set of male and female clothing for the 56 ethnic groups in China. Alas, in this ancient and vast country, the art of clothing is so splendid and dazzling, but the nation's clothing has no complete set! An embarrassing gap.

I'll do it! Wang Fushi, the "tiger," rushed out. Although the equivalent of 100,000 yuan in funding was taken by various gods and reduced to only 30,000 yuan, his tiger eyes still narrowed in a smile. His creative thinking entered a carnival, and a colorful whirlwind was already spinning there.

**Passion**

The colorful whirlwind shook Tokyo, Japan.

In July 1985, the Chinese National Ethnic Costume Exhibition opened at the NS Shinjuku Building Exhibition Hall. Thousands of spectators, as well as scholars and journalists, rushed in. As soon as they entered the brightly lit hall, they couldn't help but hold their breath, and a deep sigh of admiration welled up from their hearts! 112 life-sized male and female models, dressed in vibrant and diverse ethnic costumes, displayed beauty, the unique charm of the various ethnic groups in China, and the mysterious reflections of ancient civilization to the audience. The "Miao girl" wore a curved phoenix silver crown and a long skirt embroidered with red flowers, green leaves, insects, and butterflies, standing tall and graceful; the "Dai girl" had a red rose in her black hair and wore a close-fitting, elegant sleeveless short dress and long skirt, looking graceful and elegant; the "Luoba man" wore a bear fur hat and a rough, coarse wool woven shirt, with a belt adorned with shells, silver buckles, and copper chains, like a heroic ancient warrior; the "Kyrgyz youth" wore simple and elegant clothes, with many parts embroidered with animal horns, expressing the traditional artistic taste and totem worship of nomadic peoples...

Oh, the magnificent beauty, elegant beauty, ancient beauty, majestic beauty, solemn beauty, and bizarre beauty of Chinese ethnic costume art are all dazzling here. Those present strongly felt the primitive vitality of the five-colored earth, the magical ancient cosmology, the deep cultural accumulation, and the distant artistic origins.

This is simply a magnificent and splendid celebration of the Chinese family!

The guestbook was filled with exclamation marks like a forest!

Television, radio, and newspapers flooded with praise and reviews...

It was late at night. Wang Fushi, who couldn't sleep, walked onto the balcony and leaned against the railing, gazing at the endless lights of Tokyo. Oh, tomorrow morning he would depart for home. For the past few days, Wang Fushi, who had been immersed in excitement and exhilaration, finally felt tired. The success of the exhibition was beyond imagination, but at this moment, his heart was filled with a sense of loss and emptiness. He would return empty-handed—this complete set of Chinese ethnic costumes was funded by the Japanese boss and belonged to the Japanese, and would remain in Japan forever!

That was his, his wife's, and many of his colleagues' year and a half of hard work! Those sweaty days, those sleepless nights, those windy and rainy journeys, and the fruits of their labor, this exquisite work of art!

In the spring chill, with a thick wad of cash, from Zhejiang to Guizhou, Yunnan, Qinghai, Gansu... Over fifty, with faltering steps, unable to get on the long-distance bus, he hung on the car door begging, behind him was a gorge a dozen feet deep... Living in mountain villages, bamboo houses, warehouses, eating one meal hungry and one meal full, often strange and cold food from ethnic minorities... Traveled to Leishan, Xijiang's Miao people, Lijiang's Naxi people, Huosha's Achang people, Mangshi's Jingpo people, Lianghe's De'ang people, Tengchong, Yingjiang's Lisu people, Dali's Bai people, Chuxiong's Yi people... In June, the scorching heat, again to Heilongjiang, Inner Mongolia's Oroqen people, Evenki people, Mongolian people... Like a mental patient, seeing unique clothing, chasing after it endlessly, like a thief, hiding in a corner to take photos of passersby (ethnic minorities often have strange psychology, unwilling to be photographed, even considering it an inauspicious thing), like a ragpicker, squatting in the market, haggling over broken clothes, old shoes, and old ornaments... The luggage was heavy, so it was shipped back, and then set out again to collect and purchase... Falling ill, lying on the bed, sweating through the sheets, in the remote mountains and villages with few doctors, only chewing garlic...

When leaving, the face was full of red light, and when returning, the body was thin and the bones were visible. Ying Yulan's gaze was so sad: "You, you really risked your life!" But the dream was so brilliant, and the love was so deep, the price had to be paid. The old couple's bedding was moved into the workshop. Drawing patterns, cutting, assigning tasks to colleagues, assistants, students, and craftsmen, checking quality... The dream of art is extravagant and luxurious, while the labor of art is as scientific and rigorous as geometric reasoning. If there was any deviation, Wang Fushi's face would darken, and he would unceremoniously send it back to be redone, not caring about destroying all the smiles and relationships in public relations...

There were no silver ornaments, so Old Wang went to the factory's scrap pile to pick up some copper and iron sheets, cutting, hammering, filing, and finally taking them to be silver-plated, thus turning trash into treasure, and a pair of exquisite flower, bird, dragon, and phoenix chains would shine brightly...

Born into a wealthy family, Ying Yulan had a good hand at needlework, borrowing an embroidery machine, accompanying day and night, flying needle and thread...

Tired, lying down on the bed for a while, hungry, roasting a few sweet potatoes on the stove, in the morning, the assistant teacher knocked on the door, quickly wiping his face and going to teach... Those days were so busy that the sky was black and the earth was black, like being drunk and crazy, forgetting life and death. Chinese intellectuals are so "beautiful and cheap" and have suffered many hardships, but their spirits do not fall, because they can forget reality in their dedication and aspirations.

Now the great work is completed and the exhibition is over. The Japanese people's Chinese ethnic costumes will continue to shine and attract rolling money, while "for her, I have withered away" Wang Fushi will return empty-handed. He felt that the empty suitcase was a thousand times heavier than when he came.

Fortunately, he had already thought of it—if there is no real thing, we will publish a book. Publish a big book "Chinese Ethnic Costumes," and that would not be unworthy of our ancestors and the blood and passion of the past.

Another mad dash. The workshop became a prison without seeing the sky. In August 1985, it was decided to publish the book, and in December, the manuscript had to be submitted. Hundreds of drawings, hundreds of photos, and detailed and accurate text introductions. More than 20 teachers and students from the Stage Art Department under Wang Fushi's command and direction were in full swing...

Many people were willing to draw people but not the boring and monotonous costumes, so Ying Yulan and a few students silently took on the task. Those colorful embroidered clothes were almost sewn one by one. Later, when they were hung up, the fine and protruding texture made many viewers have visual illusions, often reaching out to touch. Ying Yulan's vision was seriously damaged...

She worked day and night like this "to prevent Old Wang from getting tired," and Wang Fushi worked so hard "to prevent Old Ying from getting tired," resulting in both of them spinning like tops and unable to stop.

Wang Fushi's edited book "Chinese Ethnic Costumes" was published in a dazzling manner! The exquisite binding, luxurious pictures, and poetic texts finally filled a gap in China's cultural field!

Now, Wang Fushi is also fruitful and outstanding, but traditional Chinese cultural psychology is very uncomfortable with this.

**Bitterness**

Someone said, the United States is a country that constantly raises questions. Germany is a country that constantly studies problems. France is a country that doesn't care much about problems. Japan is a country that constantly solves problems. China is a country that often complicates problems.

This is October 1986, in the autumn wind, rain, and night of Shanghai. The city's clamor gradually subsided, and every window glowed with moist and hazy light. Ying Yulan, sick and weak, leaned against the bedhead and sighed, her skin under the lamp light was as transparent and pale as porcelain, and her emaciated face had almost no color. Wang Fushi had just helped his wife take her medicine, and now his brows were tightly furrowed, pacing back and forth like a caged beast. Their only son, studying in the United States, called from across the ocean to inquire about his mother's condition. Ying Yulan picked up the phone and burst into tears. "Don't cry. Speak up." Wang Fushi forced a bitter smile, "Every tear shed is money..."

The mood was as gloomy as the rainy night. Wang Fushi, who loved Chinese traditional culture so deeply, now felt acutely that his entire being was being suffocated and choked by this cultural psychology like a fog.

It was in the early summer when the person in charge of the book, Hong Kong He Ping Book Company Limited, and Sichuan People's Publishing House decided to hold a grand release ceremony in Hong Kong in September, along with an ethnic costume exhibition, to create a strong impact wave. But there were only two months left, and it was not enough time. Someone suggested simply renting the set from Japan. Wang Fushi shook his head repeatedly: "What a big joke! Holding a Chinese costume exhibition, how can we rent from Japan. We still have to do it ourselves! If there's not enough time, we can do half of it!"

China must have its own complete set of ethnic costumes—this was the great vow Wang Fushi made on the day he returned from Japan.

There is no need to elaborate on the more than 50 days and nights of continuous struggle. The hardships and sufferings during this period can be imagined. Finally, the 65 sets of ethnic costumes belonging to China were completed on time!

When there were no "peaches," there were always people like Wang Fushi who planted them, and the leaders' support was also sincere. Now that the "peaches" are ripe and the achievements are shining, Wang Fushi's image has gradually become blurred for some reason.

—The "do not worry about poverty, worry about inequality" mentality began to make noise and sweep. In propaganda and reports, it was openly claimed that "this is the collective labor and collective wisdom of the Stage Art Department's Figure Sculpture and Costume Design Research Offices," and the draft contracts also clearly stated "Stage Art Department Production." What did Wang Fushi do? I'm sorry, a leader politely said: "You mainly did the later work, and the later work was mainly done by the craftsmen."

—Who would go to Hong Kong to participate in the release ceremony and the opening ceremony of the exhibition? Oh, it's better to be "fair." Wang Fushi had already been to Japan, so this time let two women go—one Ying Yulan, and one of course is the leader. Thus, a strange thing happened: the release ceremony of the book "Chinese Ethnic Costumes," the main editor of which was absent without any illness...

—Afraid that Wang Fushi would have objections, someone followed up to reason with him and move him with emotions: "Work hard, we will definitely promote you! The organization still cares about you, isn't your policy implemented, and your salary increased?" "I'm sorry, this is not a favor." Wang Fushi replied coldly, "This is a right, value, and dignity that a citizen should have. The past deprivation was wrong, and now returning it to me is right."

—The leaders were a bit hesitant to deal with the stubborn Wang Fushi, so they looked for the weak Ying Yulan for everything. Decades of political storms had made Ying Yulan's nerves extremely fragile, and she still trembled with fear whenever she went to places like the dean's office, forming a conditioned reflex. For a while, Ying Yulan collapsed, and her heart disease was seriously aggravated. The angel-like Ying Yulan was deeply loved by her students, and the students cried as they sent her to the hospital. She also thought she was done for, with tears in her eyes, she arranged her posthumous affairs. Fortunately, she later turned from danger to safety, and then found a quiet place to recuperate. The leader, fearing that the great achievement would be missed, actually chased after her to scold: "Old Ying can't always be absent!"

Wang Fushi could not help but be angry. He could not tolerate even the slightest injustice to his wife (when interviewed, every time he talked about Old Ying, he would have tears in his eyes). These frustrating and infuriating things may not be big, and compared to the great disasters of the Cultural Revolution, they are indeed not worth mentioning. Oh, when talking about that time, Wang Fushi's face suddenly changed, and his lips trembled...

In the dead of night, the crazy house searches... "Overthrow the historical counter-revolutionary Wang Fushi" was written in huge characters on the road, the same width as the road... Handcuffed and shoved into the corner of the car, escorted back to his hometown for labor reform... His wife, carrying their son, lived in fear, and at any moment, they would hear fierce roars: "Stop, you have to confess!" Ying Yulan would hug her son and tremble like autumn leaves...

These tragic scenes have all become history. At that time, they all endured it. But it was precisely the great tragedy of blood and tears that brought about today's awakening and revival of humanity. Because they had experienced great suffering and harm, today any slight disrespect for human dignity and value is intolerable.

The release ceremony and costume exhibition in Hong Kong ended in a lively manner. Those who wanted to go out and shine also had their share of glory. This set of Chinese ethnic costumes still only has 65 pieces, and it should be continued to complete it. Singapore and many other countries have made reservations for exhibitions and proposed purchases, more opportunities for bright lights and wine, and more opportunities to earn hard currency are smiling at the horizon.

The leaders were anxious and impatient, repeatedly urging, comforting, and encouraging...

All to no avail. On that rainy night, Wang Fushi decided not to do it anymore.

Thus, people embarrassingly discovered that "collective labor" and "collective wisdom" suddenly became ineffective, suddenly became powerless, and suddenly vanished into thin air. This fact seems to have once again verified Hegel's saying that true creative power exists in the individuals that make up the group, and without the subjectivity of the individual, there is no creative power.

Thus, to this day, the half-completed set of ethnic costumes is piled up in the damp small warehouse of the academy, unnoticed by anyone, emitting the rotten smell of both material and traditional cultural psychology...

Thus, to this day, the great China does not have a complete set of ethnic costumes to show off to the world and to future generations. A brilliant dream has not been woven before it was shattered.

China has swallowed another bitter fruit it has nurtured.

    痴人织梦
    蒋巍
    梦　想
    斗室里囚禁着两个精灵。彩色的梦缠绵着两个精灵。历史与未来的诱惑俘虏了两个精灵。
    这是真正的国粹。辉煌壮丽的中国各民族系列服饰正一件一件地诞生……那色彩花纹饰物上，闪射着日月星辰蓝天碧海飞禽走兽以及金龙玉凤人面蛇身乃至整个大宇宙大梦幻大迷惑。一切都在他和她灵动的指尖上盘旋歌舞。于是生命的骚动与中华古国五千年文明精髓便冲出血脉顺着指尖流泻飞溅开来，充盈于这区区斗室熠熠生辉，把两颗心照耀得一片灿烂并且好温柔好陶醉。室内只两张地铺几只盆碗，余下的空间便拥挤着尚未缝缀起来的梦的碎片。
    中国知识分子拥有的一切“财富”全在这里了——困窘的现实和富丽的梦想，当然还有爱情。
    这梦想使他和她飘飘欲仙，几乎忘却了人间烟火味。长谈之后，我为他们感到悲哀。托夫勒们津津乐道的信息时代，进入中国常常就成了畸形——好事不出门，坏事传千里。譬如眼下这件好事究竟有多少人知道呢？上海戏剧学院绿荫深处这间局促的工作室，这两颗执著的心，这两个前额沟壑重重鬓发霜雪重重的高洁的头颅，经年累月，默默无闻，完全不理会夜与昼在窗口的流转嬗递，以孱弱的生命做代价。副教授王辅世和妻子应玉兰潜心制作着中国各民族系列服饰。
    人啊，别小瞧了你们的服饰！
    自人类告别猿猴，披着兽皮树叶徘徊了漫长的岁月。在某个初冬，当一位伟大的发明家用骨针缝制了第一件“衣裳”以后，历尽沧桑的服饰艺术便成了人类文化中的瑰宝。每个民族的生产方式，风俗习惯，宗教礼仪，地理环境，气候条件，艺术传统，风度气质，乃至对宇宙的看法对自然力的困惑，无不将折光投映在他们的服饰上。可以这样说，一部服饰史就是一部人类文化发展史。难怪法朗士如此热烈地推崇服饰艺术：“假如我死后百年，还能在书林中挑选，你猜我将选什么？……我既不选小说，也不选类似小说的史籍。朋友，我将毫不迟疑地只取一本时装杂志，看看我身后一世纪的妇女服饰，它能显示给我的未来的人类文明，比一切哲学家、小说家、预言家和学者们能告诉我的都多。”
    至于中国的服饰艺术，且不说历朝历代五行八作三教九流的服饰及其流变辉煌旖丽令人叹为观止，即便是现今中国56个民族的服饰，其风格之迥异，色彩之斑斓，文化内蕴之深妙，也是举世罕见的。
    王辅世垂下硕大的头颅，紧紧地一攥拳头，再抬起头便目光霍霍了。每临大事或极难之处他便习惯地来一下这样的动作，犹如老虎腾跃之前的收缩匍匐。这时应玉兰便晓得他铁心了。“怎么，做吗？”“做！”他迸出这一个字。哦，前无古人的事情，有多少想到和想不到的困难呵！老了做事还是凭艺术家那股子激情那股子虎劲儿。应玉兰轻轻长叹了一口气。
    50年代在上海戏剧学院化妆专修班就读时，前来讲学的苏联专家列斯里指着端丽娴静的应玉兰说：“她将是中国未来最好的化妆师！”谈到桀骜不驯、画笔天马行空的王辅世，则黠然一笑：“这家伙难以预料。他胆子太大，像老虎一样。”爱情常常是一种互补。纤柔娇弱的玉兰与凶猛的“老虎”的结合，使两人的化妆技艺奇妙地结晶了——超越“术”的层次而进入“道”的境界，双双成为当今中国著名的化妆师。线的排列，面的组合，形的描摩，在他们艺思的灵光里凝合为一种动态的视觉艺术形象。应邀担任大歌舞《中国革命之歌》化妆设计的王辅世曾把1921、1927、1945、1949年的毛泽东形象塑造得维妙维肖，令许多与毛泽东共过事的白发人啧啧称奇。这几年王辅世的心野了，在本专业的艺术激流里狂荡恣肆纵情游弋，竟在传统文化的浩渺烟波中迷恋上中国服饰艺术。数十载相依为命的应玉兰也就相跟着迷进去。两个痴情人便被吞没了。
    说起来教中国人脸红。是日本财团扮演了金钱天使。他们的生意经使王辅世的梦想得以横空出世。这家财团经营的高级日本和服由上海加工制作，老板决定把中国民族服饰拿到日本炫耀一番，意在证明他们的和服产自中国必定卓然不群，想出资买一整套中国56个民族的男女服饰。呜呼，悠悠古国泱泱大国，服饰艺术如此绚丽夺目，全民族的服饰竟没有完整的一套！一个令人尴尬的大空白。
    我来做！王辅世这只“老虎”撞了出来。尽管相当于10万人民币的资金被各路神仙雁过拔毛七扣八扣，到他手里只剩了3万元，那双虎目还是笑成了一条缝。他的创造性思维进入了狂欢节，彩色的飓风已在那里飞旋了。
          痴　情
    彩色的飓风震撼了日本东京。
    1985年7月，中国全民族系列服饰展览在NS新宿大厦展览大厅剪开红绸。成千上万的观众以及学者记者们蜂拥而来，一进入灯光璀璨的大厅，他们便不由得屏住呼吸，从心底涌发出深深的惊叹！112座真人大小的男女模特儿，穿戴着色彩缤纷风格迥异的民族服饰，把美，把中华各民族的独特风采，把古代文明的神妙折光，热烈地展示在观众面前。那位苗族“少女”头戴弯凤银冠，身着绣满红花绿叶昆虫彩蝶的鲜艳长裙，亭亭玉立；那位傣家“姑娘”黑发上簪一朵红玫瑰，套着贴身淡雅的无袖短衫和长筒裙，显得那样婀娜多姿；那位珞巴族“男子”头戴熊皮帽，身着粗犷的氆氇毛织衣，腰箍饰满贝壳、银扣、铜链的毡带，仿佛雄健的古代武士；那位柯尔克孜族“小伙”衣裤潇洒简约，多处绣有牲畜犄角构成的图案，表现出游牧民族传统的艺术情趣和图腾崇拜……
    呵，中华民族服饰艺术的华丽之美，清雅之美，古朴之美，雄浑之美，凝重之美，怪诞之美，在这里流光溢彩。身临其境的人们，强烈地感受到五色土上勃发的原始生命力，神奇的古代宇宙观，深沉的文化积淀和悠远的艺术渊源。
    这简直是中华大家庭的辉煌壮丽的盛装庆典！
    观众留言簿上生长起森林般的惊叹号！
    电视电台报纸雪片般纷涌着赞誉的报道和评介……
    夜深沉。难以入眠的王辅世走上阳台，凭栏远眺楼山灯海的不夜的东京城。哦，明晨就要启程回国了，数天来一直沉浸在激动与昂奋之中的王辅世，这时才感到了疲惫。展览的成功程度是超乎想象的，可此刻他的内心充满了怅惘和失落感。他将两手空空地归去——这一整套中国各民族系列服饰由日本老板出资制作，所有权属于日本人，此后将永远留在日本了！
    那是他、他的妻子、他的许多同事整整一年半的心血呵！那些汗水淋漓的白昼那些彻夜不眠的夜晚那栉风沐雨的万里采风，结晶成这精美绝伦的艺术品呵！
    春寒料峭，贴身揣上厚厚的钞票，由浙江而贵州而云南而青海而甘肃……年过半百步履蹒跚，挤不上长途汽车便挂在车门上央求，身后就是丈许深沟……住的是山寨远村竹楼仓库，吃的是饥一顿饱一顿，还常常是少数民族稀奇古怪的生冷食物……足迹遍及雷山、西江的苗族，丽江的纳西族，户撒的阿昌族，芒市的景颇族，梁河的德昂族，腾冲、盈江的傈僳族，大理的白族，楚雄的彝族……6月酷暑，再闯黑龙江、内蒙古的鄂伦春族，鄂温克族，蒙古族……像神经病患者一样见到独特的衣饰便追上去没完没了地纠缠，像小偷儿一样掖着照像机，躲进角落给过往行人拍照（少数民族常有奇特心理，不愿让人拍照，甚至认为那是不吉祥的事情），像收破烂儿的一样蹲在集市上，为一些破衣烂靴旧饰物跟人家讨价还价……行囊沉甸甸了，便托运回去，再出发采风采购……病倒了瘫在铺上汗透被单，缺医少药的远山深寨里只好满口满口嚼大蒜……
    出门时红光满面，归来时形销骨瘦。应玉兰的目光好幽怨：“你呀你，真是舍上命了！”但梦那样灿烂，情又那样痴，代价只能在所不计了。老两口儿的铺盖卷儿搬进了工作室。画图放样裁剪，给同事助手学生工匠分派任务检查质量……艺术的梦想是狂放富丽的而艺术的劳作则像几何推理般科学严谨。稍有走样的，王辅世脸色一沉毫不客气地打发回去重来，不在乎毁掉公共关系中的一切情分与微笑……没有银饰物，老王又钻到工厂废料堆拣些铜皮铁料回来，剪呀敲呀锉呀，末了拿去镀银，于是化腐朽为神奇，一只只精美的花鸟龙凤链锁便光闪闪出世……出身大家闺秀的应玉兰自有一手好女红，借来一台绣花机陪着日夜飞针走线……困了地铺上倒一会儿，饿了火炉上烤几只红薯，早晨助教来敲门，草草抹把脸就去讲课……那日子真是忙得普天黑地如醉如痴舍生忘死。中国知识分子所以“物美价廉”屡遭磨难而精神不倒，盖因他们在献身憧憬中能忘却现实。
    而今大功告成展览落幕。日本人的中国民族服饰要继续风光下去并为他们的生意吸引来滚滚的金钱，而“为伊消得人憔悴”的王辅世却要空空落落地归去。他觉着那空荡荡的提箱比来时要沉重千百倍。
    好在他早动了心思——没有实物咱就出书。出一本《中国民族服饰》的大书，那也就不愧对列祖列宗，不愧对以往的心血与痴情了。
    又是一场玩命。工作室又成了不见天日的囚室。1985年8月决定出书，12月就要交稿，数百张画图数百张照片还有翔实而准确的文字介绍。舞台美术系的20余名师生在王辅世的调动指挥下如火如荼地投入……好些人愿意画人物不愿画枯燥单调的衣饰，应玉兰和几位学生便默默承担起来。那些色彩绚丽的绣衣简直就是一针一线地描画的。后来张挂起来，那细腻凸现的质感使好些观赏者发生视错觉，常常用手去摸。应玉兰的视力因此受到严重的损害……她这样没黑没白是
  “怕老王累着”，王辅世这样拚死拚活是“怕老应累着”，结果两人都像旋转的陀螺无法停下来。
    王辅世主编的《中国民族服饰》这部大书光彩照人地问世了！那精美的装帧富丽的图片富有诗意美的文字，总算填补了我国文化领域里的一角空白！
    现在，王辅世也硕果累累显得过于出类拔萃了，而中国传统文化心理看到这一点是很不舒服的。
          苦　果
    有人说，美国是一个不断提出问题的国家。德国是一个不断研究问题的国家。法国是个不大在乎问题的国家。日本是一个不断解决问题的国家。中国则是一个常常把问题搞复杂的国家。
    这是1986年10月，秋风秋雨秋夜中的上海。城市的喧嚣渐渐归于宁静，家家窗口透着湿润而朦胧的光。应玉兰病恹恹地倚在床头叹气，灯光下肌肤细瓷般透明苍白，瘦削的脸颊几乎没有血色。王辅世刚服侍妻子吃了药，此刻双眉紧锁，像笼中的困兽般在地上转来转去。在美国留学的唯一的儿子从大洋彼岸打来电话问候母亲的病情，玉兰拿起话筒便声泪俱下了。“别哭。快说话呀。”王辅世惨淡地勉强笑道，“那流眼泪的时间都是钱呢……”
    心境都像这雨夜般沉郁，如此痴爱中国传统文化的王辅世，眼下却痛切地感到整个身心受着这种文化心理雾一样的包围和窒息。
    那是初夏时，负责出书的香港和平图书有限公司和四川人民出版社决定9月份在香港搞一个隆重的发行仪式，同时搞个民族服饰展览，掀起个强冲击波。可只有两个多月的时间，来不及呀。有人建议干脆把日本那套租回来。王辅世连连摇头：“天大的笑话！搞中国服饰展览，怎么可以从日本租。还是我们自己做！时间不够，搞它一半也行啊。”中国一定要有自己的一整套全民族系列服饰
  ——这是王辅世从日本归来那天立下的宏愿。
    不必细说这马不停蹄连续奋战的50余个昼夜了，其间的劳顿苦辛是可以想见的。属于中国自己的65套民族服饰终于如期问世！
    没有“桃子”的时候，总是有王辅世这样一些痴人去栽的，领导者的支持也是真诚的。现在“桃子”熟了，成果成就红火起来了，王辅世的形象不知怎么就渐渐朦胧了。
    ——“不患穷患不均”的遗风开始出来鼓噪扫荡了。宣传上报道上堂而皇之地宣称，“这是上海戏剧学院舞台美术系人物造型、服装设计两个教研室”“集体劳动和集体智慧的结晶”，起草的合同上也赫然写着“舞台美术系制作”。王辅世究竟做了些什么呢？对不起，一位领导客客气气地说：“你主要是后期工作，后期工作也主要是老师傅们做的。”王辅世勃然大怒：“你讲的我不同意！我的劳动是受法律保护的！”
    ——谁去香港参加发行仪式和展览开幕式呢？哦，还是“公平”点好。王辅世已经去过日本，这次去两个女的罢——一位应玉兰，一位当然是领导。于是出现了这样的咄咄怪事：《中国民族服饰》一书的发行仪式，该书主编无病无灾却没能露面……
    ——生怕王辅世有意见，有人紧跟上来晓之以理动之以情：“好好干，我们一定把你树起来！组织上还是很关心你的，不是给你落实了政策，还长了工资吗？”“对不起，这不是恩赐。”王辅世冷冷地回答，“这是一个公民本该有的权利、价值和尊严。过去的剥夺是错误的，现在还给我是应该的。”
    ——领导们同性格刚烈的王辅世打交道都有点打憷了，于是事事都找柔弱的应玉兰。几十年的政治风暴已把应玉兰的神经搞得极脆弱，至今一到院长办公室之类的地方仍心惊胆颤，已形成一种条件反射。有一阵应玉兰累倒了，心脏病严重发作。天使般善良的应玉兰极得学生的爱戴，学生们哭着送她去医院。她也以为自己不行了，泪盈盈地吩咐了后事。所幸后来转危为安，便找个僻静的处所静养。领导怕误了大成就，竟追上门来斥责：“老应总不见面不行啊！”
    王辅世不能不愤怒了。他尤其不能容忍对妻子的一丝丝不公（年近花甲的人了，采访时每谈到老应他就热泪盈眶）。这些憋气窝火的事情或许都不大，与“文革”期间的大灾难相比实在不足挂齿。哦，谈起那时，王辅世脸色陡变嘴唇直抖……深更半夜疯狂的抄家……“打倒历史反革命王辅世”的巨幅标语写在马路上，字体同马路一样宽……戴上手铐塞进车厢角落，押回原籍劳动改造……妻子带着儿子战战兢兢过活，动辄半路上就会有凶恶的狂吼：“站住，你交待！”应玉兰便搂住儿子秋叶般发抖……
    这惨烈的一幕幕都成为历史了。那时候也都忍了。但正是那血与泪的大悲剧换来了今天人性的觉醒与复苏。正因为受过那大磨难大伤害，今天任何一点点对人的尊严、价值的蔑视都是无法容忍的。
    香港的发行仪式和服饰展览热热闹闹地结束了。想出去风光的也都风光过了。这套中国全民族系列服饰还只有65件，该继续做完它。新加坡等好些国家都来预约展出和提出收购，更多的灯红酒绿的出国机会，更多的赚硬通货的机会正在地平线那边诱惑地微笑。领导者着急上火了，一次次地催促劝慰鼓励……
    都无效。就在那个秋雨绵绵的夜晚，王辅世决定不干了。
    于是乎，人们尴尬地发现，“集体劳动”“集体智慧”忽然不起作用忽然无所作为忽然烟消云散了。这事实似乎又一次验证了黑格尔的说法，真正活的创造力存在于组成群体的个体之中，没有个体的主体性就没有创造力。
    于是乎，时至今日，那只完成了一半的全民族系列服饰堆在学院潮湿的小仓库里无人问津，散发着物质的同时也是传统文化心理的霉烂的气味……
    于是乎，时至今日，堂堂之中国，没有一套完整的可以向世界与子孙后代炫耀的全民族服饰。一个灿烂的梦还没有织成就破碎了。
      中国，吞下了又一枚自己滋养的苦果。
