Nearly 70% of New Caledonia's residents participated in the provincial assembly election yesterday in a calm atmosphere. Out of the 54 seats across the three provinces on the island, the pro-France alliance "Defend New Caledonia in the Republic" won 27 seats, while the independence-leaning Kanak Socialist National Liberation Front secured 19 seats in the northern province and surrounding islands. French political circles and various factions on the island have expressed satisfaction with the election results, indicating that the Matignon Accords signed last year have come into effect.

　　新喀岛省议会选举揭晓
    本报巴黎６月１２日电  记者吕网大报道：近７０％的新喀岛居民昨天在平静的气氛中参加了新喀里多尼亚岛省议会的选举。在全岛３省的５４个席位中，主张留在法国的保卫新喀里多尼亚在共和国内同盟获２７个席位，独立派的卡纳克社会主义民族解放阵线在北部和周围岛屿的两个省内共获１９个席位。法国政界及喀岛各方对这次选举结果均表满意，它意味着去年签定的马提翁协议已经生效。
