On the afternoon of June 23, a Greek tanker ran aground in Narragansett Bay off the coast of Rhode Island in the United States, causing the ship's fuel oil to leak and resulting in extensive pollution over a large area of the sea. This incident follows the severe oil spill from the American supertanker "Exxon Valdez" off the coast of Alaska on March 24 of this year.
