Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 28th.

The Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries today issued an open letter to foreign friends and organizations that are friendly to China. The full text of the letter is as follows:

Dear Friends,

Over the past month, and especially since June 4th when the People's Liberation Army's martial law troops suppressed the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, many foreign friends and friendly organizations have expressed their concerns and worries about the situation in China through telegrams, letters, and other means.

We would like to inform you that what recently happened in our capital, Beijing, was a counter-revolutionary riot instigated and orchestrated by a very small number of bad elements, aimed at denying the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system of China. If we had not taken decisive measures to stop it, the Chinese socialist cause, which was initiated by the older generation of revolutionaries such as Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai and has received the sympathy and support of many international friends and friendly organizations over the long course of revolution and construction, would have been in danger of being overturned. The tremendous achievements made in the past decade of reform and opening up would have been in danger of being destroyed. Therefore, the actions taken by our government to stop the further deterioration of the situation were completely necessary and in the fundamental interests of the Chinese people.

It is worth noting that recently some foreign news agencies have spread a large amount of rumors and distorted reports about the situation in China. We sincerely hope that friends from various countries can understand the true facts, distinguish right from wrong, and draw just conclusions.

Now, the social order in Beijing has basically returned to normal, and the situation across the country is stable. The Chinese government has repeatedly solemnly declared that China's policy of reform and opening up will not change; the policy of independent and peaceful foreign relations will not change; and the policy of developing friendly relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence will not change.

We also wish to reiterate to our friends that the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries will, as always, be committed to developing and enhancing mutual understanding and friendship with the peoples of all countries. All plans for friendly exchanges with foreign countries will proceed as scheduled. We also hope that foreign provinces (states) and cities that have friendly relations with China will continue to carry out mutually beneficial economic, technological, educational, and cultural exchanges and friendly visits with their counterpart provinces (autonomous regions) and cities in China.

There is a Chinese proverb, "True friends are known in times of trouble." We sincerely hope that all friends and social organizations from various countries who harbor friendly sentiments and good wishes towards China will, at this moment when China is facing temporary difficulties, give us your precious understanding, support, and cooperation, so that the trust and friendly relations that we have established over the years can be maintained and further developed, and the friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of all countries can be deepened.

　　对外友协致信各国对华友好人士团体    
    重申致力发展和增进与各国人民相互了解和友谊  期望各国朋友社会团体给以宝贵理解支持和合作
    新华社北京六月二十八日电  中国人民对外友好协会今天在北京发表了致各国对华友好人士和团体的公开信。公开信全文如下：亲爱的朋友们：
    近一个多月来，尤其是六月四日我解放军戒严部队平息在北京发生的反革命暴乱以来，不少外国朋友和友好组织通过来电、来函或其他形式，向我们表达了他们对中国局势的忧虑和关切。
    我们愿意告诉诸位，最近在我国首都北京发生的是一场由极少数坏人煽动和制造的、旨在否定中国共产党的领导、否定中国的社会主义制度的反革命暴乱。对此，如不采取坚决措施加以制止，由毛泽东、周恩来等老一辈革命家亲手开创的、在长期革命和建设中得到许许多多国际友人和友好组织同情和支持的中国社会主义事业有被颠覆的危险，中国改革开放十年取得的巨大成果有可能毁于一旦。因此，我国政府为制止事态的进一步恶化而被迫采取的行动是完全必要和符合中国人民的根本利益的。
    值得注意的是，近来有些外国新闻机构对中国的事态散布了大量谣言和歪曲报道，我们衷心希望，各国朋友能了解事实真相，明辨是非，得出公正的结论。
    现在北京的社会秩序已基本上恢复正常，全国局势是稳定的。中国政府一再郑重声明：我国的改革开放政策不会改变；独立自主的和平外交政策不会改变；在和平共处五项原则基础上同各国发展友好关系的政策也不会改变。
    我们也愿向朋友们重申，中国人民对外友好协会将一如既往，致力于发展和增进与各国人民的相互了解和友谊，各项对外友好交流计划仍将按计划进行。我们还希望，与我国有结好关系的外国省（州）市继续与中国的对口省（区）市开展互利的经贸、科技、文教和友好往来。
    中国有句谚语“患难见知交”。我们恳切期望，一切对中国怀有友好情谊和善良愿望的各国朋友和社会团体，在中国遇到暂时困难的时刻，给我们以宝贵的理解、支持和合作，使双方多年来所建立的信任和友好关系得以保持和继续发展，使中国人民与各国人民的友谊更加淳厚。
