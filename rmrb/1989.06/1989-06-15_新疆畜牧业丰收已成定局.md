Xinhua News Agency, Urumqi, June 15th. (Reporter Lan Xueyi) One of China's main livestock bases, Xinjiang, is assured of a bumper harvest in its livestock industry this year. According to figures provided by the Autonomous Region's Animal Husbandry Department, by the end of last month, the entire autonomous region had produced 11,858,400 young livestock, an increase of 229,500 from the 11,628,900 of the same period last year. The number of surviving young livestock reached 11,248,000, an increase of 487,700 from the 10,760,300 of the same period last year, with a survival rate of 95.1%, an increase of 2.74% from the 92.36% of the same period last year. The condition of the livestock herds after winter is generally better than in previous years.

Since last winter, some important winter and spring pastures in Xinjiang have received less snowfall than in previous years, and the carrying capacity of Xinjiang's pastures has been increasing in recent years. These factors have made it difficult for livestock to survive the winter and spring. The governments at all levels in the autonomous region, based on weather forecasts, have made early preparations for disaster relief work in pastoral areas. The Animal Husbandry Department has sent 26 work teams to various pastoral counties to assist local cadres in organizing efforts to build sheds, roads, and transport fodder, feed, salt, veterinary drugs, and supplies for herders' food and heating. Last year, the entire region stored 3.1 billion kilograms of dry fodder, 3.2 billion kilograms of crop stalks, and 1.36 billion kilograms of silage, all setting historical records. This winter and spring, the input of disaster relief fodder and feed increased by 24% and 100% respectively compared to the previous year. These material inputs effectively ensured the smooth progress of livestock wintering, spring migration, and lambing and rearing work. Compared to the previous year, Xinjiang's livestock mortality rate during winter this year decreased by more than 290,000 head.

　　新疆畜牧业丰收已成定局
    新华社乌鲁木齐６月１５日电  （记者蓝学毅）我国主要畜牧业基地之一的新疆，今年畜牧业丰收已成定局。据自治区畜牧厅提供数字，截至上月底，全自治区已产幼畜１１８５．８４万头，比去年同期的１１６２．８９万头增加２２．９５万头；成活幼畜１１２４．８万头，比去年同期的１０７６．０３万头增加４８．７７万头，成活率达到９５．１％，比去年同期的９２．３６％提高２．７４％；越冬后的畜群膘情普遍好于往年。
    去年入冬以来，新疆一些重要冬、春草场的降雪量较往年减少，近几年新疆草场的载畜量又在不断增加。这些都给牲畜越冬度春造成困难。自治区各级政府根据气象预报，对牧区抗灾工作提早做了准备。区畜牧厅先后派出２６个工作组奔赴各牧业县，协助基层干部组织力量修建棚圈、牧道，运送饲草、饲料、盐品、防疫药品和牧民的口粮、取暖用柴等物资。去年，全区打贮干饲草３１亿公斤，收贮农作物秸秆３２亿公斤，制作青贮饲料１３．６亿公斤，均创历史纪录。去冬今春投入抗灾饲草饲料，比上年度增长２４％和１００％。这些物资投入有效地保证了牲畜越冬度春、转场和产羔育幼工作的顺利进行。同上年度相比，今年新疆牲畜越冬少死亡２９万多头。
