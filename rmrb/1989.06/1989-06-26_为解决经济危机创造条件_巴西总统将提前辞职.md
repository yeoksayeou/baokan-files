Xinhua News Agency, Brasilia, June 25th.

To create conditions for solving the severe economic crisis, Brazilian President Sarney is prepared to resign before the end of his term in March 1990. The leader of the ruling party in the Brazilian House of Representatives, Pontes, announced this on the 25th. Before this, the presidential candidate of the Brazilian Democratic Social Party, Paulo Maluf, had already demanded that President Sarney step down early because the current government is unable to help the country escape its serious economic difficulties.

Pontes pointed out that President Sarney is willing to make "any sacrifice" for a peaceful transfer of power and will strive to prevent the economy from continuing to deteriorate during his term.

In recent years, Brazil's economy has been in great difficulty. Last year, the country's GDP fell by 0.5%, and the inflation rate reached 1,000%. Therefore, the Brazilian government began implementing the "Summer Plan," aimed at stabilizing the economy, starting January 15th of this year. However, it did not receive widespread support from the Congress, business community, and other sectors of society. Inflation not only failed to be controlled but also rose, and the "Summer Plan" was declared a failure. According to official estimates, the inflation rate for June could reach 27%.

　　为解决经济危机创造条件    
    巴西总统将提前辞职
    新华社巴西利亚６月２５日电  巴西众议院执政党领袖庞特２５日宣布，巴西总统萨尔内准备在明年３月１５日执政期满以前提前辞职，为解决严峻的经济危机创造条件。
    在此之前，巴西民主社会党总统候选人保罗·马卢夫已经要求萨尔内总统提前交权，因为现政府已无力使国家摆脱严重的经济困难。
    庞特指出，萨尔内总统愿为政权的和平过渡做出“任何牺牲”，并在任期内努力防止经济继续恶化。
    近年来，巴西经济十分困难，去年的国民生产总值下降０．５％，通膨率高达１０００％。因此，巴西政府从今年１月１５日开始实施旨在稳定经济的“夏季计划”，但未能得到国会、企业界和社会其他阶层的广泛支持，通货膨胀率不但未能控制，反而上升，“夏季计划”宣告失败。据官方估计，６月份的通货膨胀率可达２７％。
