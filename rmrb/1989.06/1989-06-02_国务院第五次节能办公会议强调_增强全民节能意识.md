The Fifth State Council Energy-Saving Office Meeting Emphasizes Enhancing Public Awareness of Energy Conservation

BEIJING, June 2 (Xinhua) -- The State Council held its fifth energy-saving office meeting today, emphasizing the need to enhance public awareness of energy conservation and actively promote energy-saving work.

Vice Premier Zhou Jiahua presided over the meeting and delivered a speech.

Vice Minister of the State Planning Commission Ye Qing pointed out that China's energy utilization rate is low, product energy consumption is high, economic efficiency is poor, and energy waste is severe. The main reason for this situation, from a subjective perspective, is that the energy-saving awareness of the entire population, especially some leading cadres, is weak. The phenomenon of prioritizing development over conservation, speed over efficiency, and output over energy consumption is quite common in various regions and departments.

Zhou Jiahua stressed that energy conservation is a mass work. Social energy-saving propaganda and education should be carried out to enhance public awareness of energy conservation. In all government agencies, organizations, enterprises, institutions, and the general public, it is necessary to vigorously advocate for saving electricity, water, oil, and coal. Various activities such as establishing energy-saving factories, energy-saving industries, and energy-saving cities should be launched to make energy conservation a widespread virtue in society.

The meeting required that energy-saving work should have clear goals. Various regions and industries should formulate specific energy-saving plans based on the requirements of rectification and deepening reform and the problems existing in energy-saving work. Product energy consumption should be regularly published, and strict assessments should be conducted. Technical renovations should shift from merely expanding production capacity to focusing on saving energy, improving product quality, and enhancing energy utilization efficiency. All levels of competent departments should strengthen leadership, persist in energy-saving work, and grasp it firmly.

　　国务院第五次节能办公会议强调
    增强全民节能意识
    本报北京６月２日讯  记者鲁牧报道：国务院今天召开第五次节能办公会议，强调增强全民节能意识，积极推进节能工作。
    国务委员邹家华主持今天的会议，并讲了话。
    国家计委副主任叶青指出，我国能源利用率低，产品单耗高，经济效益差，能源浪费的现象很严重。形成这种状况的原因，从主观方面看，主要是全体公民特别是一些领导干部的节能意识淡薄，各地区、各部门重开发轻节约、重速度轻效益、重产量轻物耗的现象相当普遍。
    邹家华强调，节能是项群众性的工作。要开展社会节能宣传教育，增强全民节能意识。在所有机关、团体、企业事业单位和广大居民中，大力提倡节约用电、用水、用油、用煤，开展建立节能工厂、节能行业、节能城市等多种活动，使节能美德在全社会蔚然成风。
    会议要求，节能工作应有明确的目标。各地区、各行业要根据治理整顿、深化改革的要求和节能工作中存在的问题，制订具体的节能规划，定期公布产品单耗，严格考核。技术改造要从只注意扩大生产能力，转向以节约能源、提高产品质量、提高能源利用效益为重点。各级主管部门要加强领导，把节能工作坚持下去，抓紧抓好。
