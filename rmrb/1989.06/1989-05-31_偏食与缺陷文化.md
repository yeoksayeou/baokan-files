From the perspective of nutrition science, it is advocated that a diverse diet should be used to meet the needs of the human body and promote health. Similarly, cultural arts, as spiritual nourishment, also need to be imparted and nourished to our children in various forms.

Currently, in many places in our country, the "children's arts fever" has arisen, but it has also made discerning individuals aware of a deficiency—a deficiency that needs to be promptly addressed, just as one would correct a child's picky eating habits.

This deficiency manifests in the following ways: prioritizing Western instruments over traditional Chinese instruments—pianos, violins, and electronic keyboards are everywhere, while flutes and erhus are almost unheard of. It is understood that Beijing Musical Instrument Factory's flutes and erhus are hard to sell, as if they are not musical instruments at all. Many children do not even know what a erhu or flute is. Prioritizing painting over handicrafts—children carrying sketchbooks and holding paintbrushes are considered the epitome of art education, while paper cutting, clay work, and paper collage are considered secondary. Prioritizing soft, lyrical songs over powerful, heroic songs—taking the National Excellent Children's Songs Competition held every five years by the Ministry of Culture as an example, the first competition featured powerful and heroic songs like "Youth, Youth, the Spring of the Motherland," while the 1986 second competition saw songs like "My Little Melon Patch" and "Under the Betel Nut Tree, Swinging the Net Bed" winning top prizes. Prioritizing individual arts over collective arts—sending children to training classes or inviting teachers home to learn violin or piano is common, while organizing collective recitations or school plays is rare...

Here, a question that is not necessarily obvious needs to be raised. Is the purpose of children learning and appreciating art to satisfy their own aesthetic needs and self-entertainment, or to satisfy adults' appreciation desires and psychological balance? Naturally, the answer in principle is the former. But in practice? The examples mentioned earlier all relate to the latter purpose. We (adults) decide what is interesting and have children learn and do those things, essentially taking over and suppressing children's natural interests. Perhaps it is due to a utilitarian mindset at work, thinking about which art forms will be directly beneficial for one's child in the future, including kindergarten admission, school advancement, and entering key schools. Thus, efforts are focused on those arts. Forcing a three-year-old child to play the piano, making the child cry at the sight of a piano. Why bother!

Adults' biases towards art lead to children's picky eating in the realm of art.

Indeed, every art form has its limitations, but should we avoid one limitation only to be confined by another? Who dares to say that a violin is absolutely better than an erhu? Can learning the erhu not provide children with artistic inspiration and enjoyment? Is learning to act in a play less practical for school admission than playing the piano, so it should be excluded from the realm of artistic education? Does learning clay work, paper cutting, and corn stalk painting mean that a child lacks artistic talent? In our vast rural areas, is it more practical for children to learn the erhu, flute, clay work, and paper cutting than to learn the piano, electronic keyboard, and painting?

There is also the issue of the spirit of the times. I do not dare to say that singing a few powerful and stirring songs will make our children become Paul Koriatskin, but if they are constantly immersed in soft and sweet melodies, how will it help cultivate their courageous and progressive mental qualities?

A series of question marks do not solve more problems; I only hope that they will be transformed into a correct answer in practical settings.

　　偏食与缺陷文化
　　李效
    用营养学的观点，主张以杂食满足人体需要和促进健康。作为精神食粮的文化艺术，也同样需要用多种形式灌输、滋养我们的少年儿童。
    目前在我国许许多多地方兴起的“少儿文艺热”，倒使明眼人察觉了一种缺陷，一种需要及时补足的缺陷——正如要纠正孩子偏食的毛病一样。
    这种缺陷的现象表现于：重西洋乐器，轻民族乐器——钢琴、小提琴、电子琴到处普及，笛子、二胡几乎无人问津，据了解，北京乐器厂的笛子、二胡很难卖出，仿佛那不是乐器似的，许多小孩子甚至不知二胡笛子为何物。重画笔美术，轻手工美术——让孩子背着画夹，执着画笔，才算是正宗美术教育，而布贴、泥工、剪纸则另当别论。重轻柔抒情歌曲，轻刚劲豪迈的歌曲——仅举每五年由文化部举办的全国少年儿童优秀歌曲评奖为例，第一届曾出现刚劲豪迈的《少年少年祖国的春天》等歌目，而到１９８６年的第二届，获头奖的也就是《我的小瓜棚》、《槟榔树下摇网床》一类歌了。重个体艺术，轻集体艺术——送孩子参加培训班，或把教师请到家里来，不惜花钱学习小提琴、钢琴的家庭有的是，而学校里业余活动组织集体朗诵、排演校园话剧却不多见……
    这里，需要提出一个并非不言而喻的问题。儿童学习、接受艺术是以满足其自身审美需求，自娱自美为目的，还是以满足成人的品赏欲、满足成人的某种心理平衡为目的？自然，道理上都肯定前者。可做起来呢？前面所举的例子，都与这后一种目的有关系。我们（成人）认为什么有趣，就让孩子学什么做什么，实际上包办代替，抑制童趣。或许是因为一种社会功利意识在作祟，学会哪些艺术种类对自己的孩子今后走入社会有直接好处，包括入托、升学、进重点学校，于是就在哪些艺术上下功夫。逼着三岁的孩子往钢琴上趴，闹得孩子见了钢琴就想哭。何苦来！
    有成人对艺术的偏见，就有对儿童艺术上的偏食。
    诚然，每种艺术形式皆有其局限性，但是否因避免此一种局限而囿于彼一种局限呢？谁敢说小提琴就比二胡绝对地好呢？学二胡就不能使孩子得到艺术的熏陶，就不能得到美的享受吗？学习演话剧不比会弹钢琴对升学有实用，就把学话剧排除在艺术美育范畴之外吗？是学会了泥工、布贴、高粱秆画，孩子身上便没有艺术细胞吗？在我们广大的农村，少年儿童学习二胡、笛子、泥工、剪纸，是否比学钢琴、电子琴、画笔美术更具有实际条件呢？
    还有一个时代气质的问题。我不敢说唱几支豪迈激奋的歌子就能使我们的少年儿童成为保尔·柯察金，但终日熏陶于软绵绵柔蜜蜜的调子里，又怎利于培养他们勇敢、奋进的心理素质呢？
    一连串的问号说明不了更多的问题，我只愿它在实践环境中化成一个正确答案的句号。
