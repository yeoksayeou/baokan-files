Thailand will implement stricter legal measures to control the spread of AIDS. Thailand's Deputy Minister of Health, Suthas, stated that according to new legal regulations, the Thai government and relevant departments will have the authority to detain and punish AIDS patients who do not comply with official regulations. Those who know they have contracted AIDS but do not register will also be penalized once discovered.

Recent official statistics released by Thailand indicate that the country has now identified 7,500 individuals carrying the AIDS virus. This number, compared to just a few hundred two years ago, shows an alarming rate of increase.

　　泰国采取法律措施控制艾滋病蔓延
    泰国政府将采取更严格的法律措施，以便控制艾滋病的蔓延。泰国卫生部副部长苏撒斯说，根据新的法律规定，泰国政府和有关部门将有权拘留和惩罚那些不遵守官方有关规定的艾滋病患者。那些明知自己已染上艾滋病却不去登记的患者，一经发现也会受到制裁。
    泰国官方最近公布的统计数字表明，泰国目前已发现七千五百名艾滋病毒携带者，这与两年前只有几百人的数字相比，其增长速度惊人。
