A leadership group of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO) arrived here today by special plane from Lusaka, marking the beginning of SWAPO's peaceful participation in the constitutional elections scheduled for November.

The group, led by SWAPO's Political Bureau member Hage Geingob, consists of 17 people, including SWAPO's Foreign Affairs Secretary Theo-Ben Gurirab and Information Secretary Hilifa Mupya. Over 200 SWAPO cadres also returned to their homeland with the leadership group.

Geingob told reporters at the airport, "I left my country when I was young, and today, after 27 years of being away from my homeland, I am very happy to return to participate in my country's independence process."

The leadership group was welcomed at the airport by SWAPO leaders in Namibia, officials from the United Nations Transition Assistance Group, and foreign observers. Thousands of SWAPO supporters gathered outside the airport building, cheering the arrival of the leadership group.

The New China News Agency reports from Lusaka on June 18th: 230 Namibian refugees left here today by plane, returning to Namibia.

Among the returnees, 15 are SWAPO Central Committee members. They traveled from Luanda, the capital of Angola, via Lusaka back to their country.

Hage Geingob, a senior SWAPO official responsible for election affairs, said that SWAPO's task in the elections scheduled for November this year is arduous. He pointed out that the struggle has not ended, and SWAPO is fully prepared to strive for victory in the elections.

This morning, Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda met with SWAPO officials and said he hoped they would effectively organize the Namibian people upon their return to ensure victory in the upcoming elections.

Starting from the 12th, 41,000 Namibian refugees will gradually return from Angola and Zambia to participate in the November elections.
