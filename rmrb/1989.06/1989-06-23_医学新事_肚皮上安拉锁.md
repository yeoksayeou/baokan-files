A zipper on the abdomen can open and close like a jacket. This is not a joke but a practical method in modern surgery.

In cases of severe abdominal diseases such as peritonitis and pancreatitis, it is often necessary to frequently check the condition inside the abdomen and to clean out accumulated pus, blood, and necrotic tissue daily. Clearly, it is not feasible to perform surgery every day for this purpose. Therefore, the method of installing a zipper on the abdomen has been developed. A piece of polyethylene mesh is sewn onto the abdominal muscles, and then a zipper is installed on the mesh, allowing it to be opened and closed as needed. For hygiene reasons, the zipper must be opened in the operating room, but it does not require general anesthesia; local anesthesia is sufficient.

Italy was the first to use this surgical "zipper" in 1986. At that time, the director of the Emergency Surgery Research Institute at the University of Rome performed surgery on a patient with severe peritonitis and had to leave the patient's abdomen open, covering the wound with only a piece of polyethylene mesh. The next day, instead of removing the polyethylene "patch," he cut a hole in the middle and sewed on a sterilized ordinary plastic zipper.

Now, specialized zippers for the human abdomen are industrially produced. Italy has used abdominal zippers in 50 cases. Generally, after 10 to 15 days, when the peritonitis or pancreatitis has healed, the zipper can be removed and the abdomen sewn up again. Many hospitals in the Federal Republic of Germany, Australia, and the United States have also adopted this treatment method.

　　医学新事——肚皮上安拉锁
    本报记者  罗晋标
    在肚皮上缝个拉锁，可以像夹克衫那样任意开合。这绝非笑话，而是当今世界外科处置的一种好办法。
    在腹膜炎、胰腺炎等某些严重的腹部疾病中，可能需要经常检查腹内情况，而且最好每天清除腹腔内积存的脓血和坏死组织。诚然，不能为此而每天动一次外科手术，于是便产生了在肚皮上安拉锁的办法。在腹壁肌肉上缝上一块聚乙烯网，然后在网上安上拉锁，就能任意开关。出于卫生原因，这个拉锁要在手术室里打开，但无需全麻，只需局部镇痛。
    意大利是在１９８６年首次使用这种外科“拉锁”的。当时罗马大学紧急外科研究所所长给一位严重腹膜感染患者动手术后，不得不让病人“敞着肚皮”，在伤口上只缝了一块聚乙烯网。第二天，他没有揭去聚乙烯“补丁”，而是在其中间割开，缝上一个经严格消毒过的普通粗齿塑料拉锁。
    如今，人体腹部专用拉锁已工业化生产。意大利使用腹部拉锁的已有５０例，一般在１０至１５天后腹膜感染或胰腺炎病愈，便可取下拉锁，重新缝合肚皮。在联邦德国、澳大利亚、美国的许多医院中也采用了这种处置方法。
