Tibet Welcomes Foreign Investment

	All cooperation projects between Tibet and various countries will continue to be effectively implemented according to the agreements. We welcome foreign investors to come to Tibet and welcome the financial, technological, and human resources assistance provided to promote Tibet's economic development.

	This was stated by Mao Rupai, Vice Chairman of the Tibet Autonomous Region People's Government, on June 20 when he briefed foreign personnel in Lhasa on the domestic and regional situations in Tibet.

	In recent days, some foreign personnel in Tibet have received calls or notifications from their home countries asking them to leave. A foreign female teacher expressed her unwillingness to interrupt the continuity of her teaching schedule, believing that the place is safe and the Tibetan people are friendly. Mao Rupai praised the foreign personnel in Tibet for their sense of responsibility in executing the agreements or contracts between both parties.

    本报拉萨６月２３日电  记者刘伟报道：“西藏和各国进行的各项合作项目，将继续按协议有效执行，欢迎外商来藏投资，欢迎为促进西藏经济发展所给予的资金、技术和人才援助。”西藏自治区人民政府副主席毛如柏２０日向在拉萨的外国工作人员通报国内和西藏区内情况时作了上述表示。
    前些天，一些在藏的外国工作人员收到国内来电或通知，要求其撤离。一位外籍女教师表示，她不愿中断教学课程的连续性，她认为这里很安全，西藏人民很友好。毛如柏对在藏的外国工作人员执行双方协议或合同的责任心表示赞赏。
