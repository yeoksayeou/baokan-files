Japan's Broadseas Paper Company has successfully developed the world's lightest paper, weighing only 5 grams per square meter. The material used to make this paper is polyester, and the production method employs the common "wet" process.

The company has been researching the development of 5-gram paper for the past two years. This time, the material used is "fine denier" made from ultra-fine polyester. This material has not yet been released to the market and is being used for the first time.

The world's largest book was exhibited on June 21 in Toulouse, France. This book measures 4 meters in length and 3 meters in width, weighing 8 tons. The entire book consists of 30 pages, with each page weighing approximately 200 kilograms. The content of the book introduces notable figures from the local art, industrial, and commercial sectors.
