    Maintaining Operations Amidst Turmoil: True Friendship Shines in Difficult Times
    Strengthening Sino-Foreign Cooperation in the Petrochemical Industry
    China Fulfills All Oil Export Contracts as Required

    Beijing, June 23 (People's Daily) — During the counterrevolutionary turmoil in Beijing, the plants and facilities under the China National Petroleum and Chemical Corporation (Sinopec) did not stop production for even a minute. This is what the reporter learned from a symposium held recently by Sinopec and representatives from foreign companies and banks, as well as on-site experts.

    Sinopec is one of China's major enterprise groups, responsible for multiple key projects such as the Daqing, Shandong, Yangzi, and Shanghai 300,000-ton ethylene engineering projects. During the turmoil in China, many friendly companies and banks persisted in conducting various economic and trade exchanges and cooperation with Sinopec. Many experts overcame difficulties and maintained their posts. In the construction site of the Yangzi 300,000-ton ethylene project in Nanjing, several experts from the West German company Lurgi, who were helping with the construction, continued to work on-site after receiving evacuation notices, ensuring the smooth progress of the project.

    Meanwhile, it is reported that China's oil trade has progressed smoothly this year, with the oil export volume in the first half of the year expected to match that of the same period last year. The China National Chemical Import and Export Corporation recently sent a telegram to relevant Japanese trading companies, reaffirming the guarantee of oil supply to Japan.

    A responsible person from the China National Chemical Import and Export Corporation told the reporter that the company has been responsible for the import and export of crude oil and refined oil in China. Before and after the counterrevolutionary turmoil in Beijing, the company's crude oil and refined oil import and export business has been proceeding normally, with no interruption in port shipments. The company has fulfilled all its external contracts as required.

    又讯　记者陆振华报道：今年我国石油贸易进展顺利，预计上半年石油出口量与去年同期持平。中国化工进出口总公司最近致电日本有关商社，重申确保对日本的石油供应。
    中国化工进出口总公司负责人对记者说，中化公司一直承担着中国原油、成品油的进出口任务。在北京发生反革命暴乱前后，公司的原油、成品油进出口业务一直在正常进行，港口出运工作从未间断，公司所有对外签订的合同都能按要求履约。
