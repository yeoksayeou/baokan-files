For some time, the dispute over short-range missiles within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has intensified, drawing widespread attention from the international community.

The focus of NATO's debate on short-range missiles is whether NATO's short-range missiles deployed in Western Europe should be updated, and whether negotiations with the Warsaw Pact's short-range missiles should be expedited. Within NATO, there are two main factions: the U.S.-UK camp and the Western European camp led by West Germany.

The dispute was initially sparked by West Germany. On February 10, the West German government spokesman announced that West Germany did not believe NATO needed to make a decision on short-range missile modernization before 1991. Since most of NATO's short-range missiles are deployed in West Germany, the U.S. considered West Germany's stance to be of great significance. The next day, Secretary of State Baker flew to Europe to lobby 14 NATO member countries, attempting to pressure West Germany into agreeing to expedite short-range missile modernization. However, the efforts yielded little results. Among the more than 10 member countries, only the UK firmly supported the U.S. Encouraged by the U.S., British Prime Minister Thatcher visited West Germany and France in late February to lobby, but to no avail. Subsequently, there were reports that NATO had reached a compromise agreement on the issue, but this was immediately denied by the West German government. After the NATO Nuclear Planning Group meeting in mid-April, the U.S. proposed a concession, temporarily not discussing the deployment issue, and West Germany agreed to discuss short-range missile modernization after 1991. However, on April 21, West German Chancellor Kohl delivered a statement in the Bundestag, urging the U.S. and the Soviet Union to expedite negotiations on reducing European short-range missiles. This public dissent greatly annoyed the U.S., but West Germany had the support of Denmark, the Netherlands, Belgium, and Norway, and Italy and France held conciliatory views, so it remained steadfast in its position. This led to an unprecedented "crisis" in NATO's internal relations.

There are multiple reasons for the short-range missile dispute within NATO.

Firstly, there are significant differences in policy towards the Soviet Union. After Gorbachev came to power, he adjusted the Soviet Union's domestic and foreign policies. Countries like West Germany believed that the Soviet Union was undergoing profound changes, and its policy of détente was sincere. The West should seize this "historic" opportunity to engage in serious negotiations with the East. However, the U.S. and the UK were skeptical of the Soviet Union's policy of détente, emphasizing that "one should not place hope in individuals." Given the Soviet Union's clear advantage in short-range and conventional forces, NATO could only improve its own weapon systems to strengthen its negotiating position with the Soviet Union.

Secondly, there are differing views on how to establish an effective nuclear deterrent. The U.S. and the UK emphasize that since countries like West Germany also believe that the "third zero option" to completely eliminate European short-range missiles is not feasible, it indicates that they agree with NATO maintaining an effective nuclear force in Europe. According to the U.S.-Soviet Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty, both sides will withdraw all missiles with a range of over 500 kilometers in Europe by 1992. NATO's remaining 88 Lance short-range missile launchers (with a range of 115 kilometers) will also be decommissioned by 1995. Therefore, NATO needs to develop a high-precision missile with a range slightly less than 500 kilometers to maintain the effectiveness of its nuclear deterrent. Experience shows that it takes about 4 years from the development to the deployment of a missile. If deployment begins before 1995, a decision on the quantity and deployment location of the missiles should be made before 1991. Currently, the U.S. has chosen a multiple rocket launcher as the missile launch system. Since this missile is used in the European theater, the U.S. government cannot obtain congressional funding for missile development without NATO's approval. Countries like West Germany believe that the modernization of short-range missiles depends on the progress of conventional arms negotiations, and the overall improvement of the European situation may no longer require the modernization of short-range missiles. Moreover, in a "purely conventional" battle, the loss of dual-use aircraft, artillery, and missiles could significantly weaken NATO's nuclear deterrent in Europe. All these factors have deepened NATO's doubts about the modernization of short-range missiles.

Thirdly, the interests of NATO member countries have clashed. The U.S., in order to maintain its strategic advantage over the Soviet Union and strengthen its negotiating position, attempted to expedite the modernization of NATO's short-range missiles. However, West Germany was concerned that since most of the short-range missiles of NATO and the Warsaw Pact are deployed in West Germany, in the event of a conflict between the two military blocs, Germany would be the first to become a nuclear battlefield. In the long term, easing the confrontation between the two blocs would be beneficial for West Germany's "new Eastern policy" and ultimately the reunification of Germany. Additionally, West Germany will hold elections next year, and the Kohl government needs to raise the banner of nuclear disarmament to gain votes. Many allied countries supporting West Germany's views also hope to promote East-West détente and develop relations with Eastern Europe to gain more economic benefits.

In summary, the short-range missile dispute within NATO has deep roots and indicates that the rifts within the NATO bloc are widening and difficult to fundamentally heal. It is also evident that the continuous economic growth and increasing independence of countries like West Germany will pose a greater challenge to the Bush administration's efforts to integrate the alliance into its security policy.

　　北约内部短导之争
    陈方明　胡豫闽
    一个时期以来，北大西洋公约组织内部的短导之争愈演愈烈，引起国际社会的普遍关注。
    北约在短导问题上的争论焦点是：北约部署在西欧的短导是否应予更新？与华沙条约组织的短导谈判是否应尽快举行？北约内部就此分为美英派和以西德为首的西欧派。
    争论首先由西德挑起。今年２月１０日，西德政府发言人宣布，西德认为北约没有必要在１９９１年前就短导现代化问题作出决定。由于北约的短导大多部署在西德，美认为西德的态度事关重大，次日即派国务卿贝克飞赴欧洲，对１４个北约盟国轮番游说，试图使西德在盟国的共同压力下，同意尽快实现短导现代化，然而收效甚微。在１０多个盟国中，真正坚定支持美的只有英国。在美的鼓励下，英国首相撒切尔夫人于２月下旬游说西德和法国，也未如愿。此后，又有消息说北约内部已就此达成一项折衷协议，但随即遭到西德政府的否认。４月中旬的北约核计划小组会议后，美国提出让步建议，暂不讨论部署问题，西德才同意在１９９１年后讨论短导的现代化。但４月２１日，西德总理科尔在联邦议院发表声明，敦促美苏尽快进行削减欧洲短导谈判。这种公开唱反调的做法很使美国恼火，但西德有丹麦、荷兰、比利时、挪威的背后支持，加上意大利及法国持调和主张，因而始终不肯改变立场。北约内部关系由此陷入了一次前所未有的“危机”。
    北约内部爆发短导之争有着多方面的原因。
    其一，在对苏政策上存在着重要分歧。戈尔巴乔夫上台后，调整了苏的内外政策。西德等盟国认为，苏正在发生具有深刻意义的转变，其缓和政策是有诚意的，西方应该抓住这一“历史性”时机，与东方进行认真的谈判；但美英则对苏的缓和政策怀有疑虑，强调“不应将希望寄托于个人”，在苏的短导和常规力量占有明显优势的情况下，北约只有先改善自己的武器系统，才能增强对苏的谈判地位。
    其二，对如何建立有效的核威慑认识不同。美英强调，既然西德等也认为彻底消除欧洲短导的“第三个零点方案”不足取，说明它们同意北约在欧洲维持有效的核力量；而根据美苏中导条约，双方将在１９９２年前全部撤除在欧洲的射程５００公里以上的导弹，北约仅剩的８８具长矛短导（射程１１５公里）发射架也将于１９９５年退役，因此，北约需要发展一种射程略低于５００公里的高精度导弹，以维持其核威慑的有效性；经验表明从导弹研制到部署约需４年时间，若于１９９５年前开始部署，１９９１年前应就导弹的需求量和部署地等作出决议；目前美已选择多管火箭炮作为导弹的发射系统，由于这种导弹用于欧洲战区，没有北约批准，美政府难以就研制导弹获得国会拨款。西德等盟国则认为，短导的现代化取决于常规军备谈判的进展，而欧洲总体形势的改善，可能无需再使短导现代化。而且在一场“纯常规”的战斗中，常规与核两用的飞机、火炮、导弹等武器的损耗，有可能大大削弱北约在欧洲的核威慑效能。凡此种种，更加深了北约内部对短导现代化的疑虑。
    其三，北约盟国各自利益产生了碰撞。美国为了保持对苏的战略优势和增强对苏谈判的地位，试图尽快实行北约短导的现代化。而西德则担心，北约和华约的短导大多部署在西德，一旦两大军事集团发生冲突，德国将最先成为核战场；从长远考虑，缓解两大集团的对峙，有利于西德推行“新东方政策”，最终实现两德的统一；此外，西德明年将举行大选，科尔政府需要打出核裁军的旗帜，以获取选票。支持西德观点的许多盟国也希望通过促进东西方缓和，发展与东欧的关系，以获取更多的经济实惠。
    由此看来，北约内部的这场短导之争有着深刻的背景，也表明北约集团内部的裂痕正在加深，难以从根本上弥合。还应该看到的是，西德等国经济力量的持续增长及其独立意识的日益加强，将使布什政府把联盟纳入其安全政策的努力面临越来越强烈的挑战。
