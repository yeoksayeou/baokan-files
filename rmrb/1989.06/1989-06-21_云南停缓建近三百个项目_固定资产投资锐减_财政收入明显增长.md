Yunnan Halts or Slows Construction of Nearly 300 Projects
Fixed Asset Investment Significantly Reduced, Fiscal Revenue Noticeably Increased

KUNMING, June 21 (Xinhua) — Yunnan Province's economic restructuring efforts have yielded initial results, with fixed asset investment being effectively controlled.

As of now, the province has halted or slowed the construction of 282 projects, reducing investments by 512 million yuan. Among these, 39 projects involving the construction of large-scale buildings and facilities have been halted or slowed, resulting in a reduction of 160 million yuan in investments. Last year, Yunnan's actual fixed asset investment amounted to 5.88 billion yuan, while this year it stands at 3.407 billion yuan, a reduction of 42.1%. For the first five months of this year, the cumulative fixed asset investment was 732 million yuan, a decrease of 27.2% compared to the same period last year. Notably, investment has shifted towards strengthening agriculture, energy, transportation, scarce raw materials, and education.

During the restructuring, Yunnan's industrial production has maintained a certain growth rate. In the first five months, the province's industrial output value increased by 6.4% compared to the same period last year. Fiscal revenue reached 2.029 billion yuan, an increase of 12% compared to the same period last year, surpassing the industrial growth rate.
