	For the resolution of debt problems, the "Group of Ten" held a special meeting.

	Bern, June 2 (Xinhua) - The "Group of Ten," composed of major Western developed countries, held a special meeting in Bern on June 2. The meeting adopted a report on redefining the roles of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank and issued a joint statement.

	The joint statement said that due to the progress made in debt strategies over the years, the risks borne by the international financial system have been significantly reduced.

	The financial and monetary authorities of the "Group of Ten" who attended the meeting believe that the suggestions for solving the debt problem proposed by some countries in recent months, especially the "Brady Plan" proposed by the United States, constitute a "good basis" for further discussion on the debt issue. However, they pointed out that new efforts are still needed to fully resolve the debt problem.

	The "Group of Ten" believes that a strengthened debt strategy should be based on multiple factors. First, the borrowing countries should demonstrate their implementation of "sound economic policies" under the support of the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank to mobilize savings and investment and reverse the outflow of capital. Meanwhile, the banking sector should pay more attention to voluntary debt reduction activities, which will be supported by the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank in countries that are undertaking "fundamental and convincing" economic reforms.

	The "Group of Ten" is also known as the "Paris Club," established in November 1961. Its member countries include the United States, Britain, France, West Germany, Italy, Japan, the Netherlands, Canada, Belgium, and Sweden. Switzerland joined in 1984. There are currently 11 member countries.

    为解决债务问题
    “10国集团”举行特别会议
    新华社日内瓦6月2日电  伯尔尼消息：由西方主要发达国家组成的“10国集团”2日在伯尔尼举行特别会议。会议通过了关于重新确定国际货币基金组织和世界银行作用的报告，并发表了一项联合声明。
    联合声明说，由于多年来债务战略取得的进展，“（国际）金融体系所担的风险已明显减轻”。
    出席会议的“10国集团”财政和金融负责人在声明中认为，最近几个月中由一些国家提出的解决债务问题的建议，特别是美国提出的“布雷迪计划”，构成了继续就债务问题进行讨论的“良好基础”。但他们指出，为圆满解决债务问题，还必须作出新的努力。
    “10国集团”认为，一种强化的债务战略应依据多种因素。首先，借债国应表明其在国际货币基金组织和世界银行的支持下执行“健康的经济政策”，以动员储蓄和投资，扭转资本外流的状况；而银行界则应更加重视自愿缩减债务的活动，在那些进行“根本性和令人信服的”经济改革的国家中，这样的活动将会得到国际货币基金组织和世界银行的支持。
    “10国集团”又称“巴黎俱乐部”，成立于1961年11月，成员国有美国、英国、法国、联邦德国、意大利、日本、荷兰、加拿大、比利时和瑞典，1984年瑞士加入。现有成员国11个。
