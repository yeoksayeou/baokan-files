There is a peculiar phenomenon in Shenyang: wherever there is a road, there are "reverse tricycles."

The so-called "reverse tricycle" is a three-wheeled pedal-driven vehicle with two wheels in front and the rider's seat at the back, ridden in reverse.

The "reverse tricycle" is used for transportation and as a stall when parked. With the development of a diversified economy, it has become an indispensable tool for individual business owners. Before 1980, the entire city had only a few thousand of these vehicles, mostly used by factories and shops. In just ten years, Shenyang's individual business owners have grown to 180,000, and the number of "reverse tricycles" has surged to over 130,000.

Shenyang residents' lives have become inseparable from the "reverse tricycle." At the vegetable wholesale market in the city center, every morning around 6 AM, "reverse tricycles" from all directions gather here, then transport hundreds of thousands of kilograms of vegetables to hundreds of markets across the city. The traffic police department statistics show that within an hour, 2,500 "reverse tricycles" enter and exit this area. At the fruit wholesale market, there are also more than 2,000 "reverse tricycles" daily, transporting tens of train cars of pears, bananas, and mandarins.

Currently, Shenyang has dozens of "reverse tricycle" transportation markets. If you need to transport refrigerators, washing machines, carpets, or furniture, just wave your hand, and it's usually done for no more than 10 yuan, very convenient.

In the competitive freight market, how does the "reverse tricycle" survive and thrive? A vehicle owner revealed the secret: compared to a three-wheeled vehicle, it is not only easier to drive but also has a longer body, lower frame, and can carry more goods. A basket of 25 kilograms of oranges can fit 20-30 baskets on one "reverse tricycle," and two of them can match a "half-cut beauty" (a type of passenger and cargo van). He said, "We individual business owners need transportation tools for purchasing and selling goods. How many can afford a car? But this 300-yuan 'reverse tricycle' is affordable and easy to maintain. It doesn't eat grass or drink oil, it's economical and convenient."

The proliferation of the "reverse tricycle" family not only activates urban and rural markets but also provides livelihoods for many unemployed people, easing social employment pressures.

In front of the fruit wholesale station, a woman pushes a cart of bananas out. She is named Zhōng Píng, 47 years old. She not only has to support her husband, who is sick and unable to work, and her three children but also has to support her aging parents. "Life is too hard for me!" she told the reporter, "No matter the weather, I come here every day to pull eight or nine baskets of fruit back to sell. I can earn 400-500 yuan a month, and the whole family's meals depend on this 'donkey.' But this is still much better than the 'iron rice bowl' era."

The society's demand for "reverse tricycles" has stimulated the development of the manufacturing industry. In the vehicle trading market of Huánggǔ District, there are sellers of wheels, steel pipes, and complete vehicles, with various sizes available for selection. Yang Liánshān, a 61-year-old veteran worker, is the most famous producer here. He told the reporter that since the reform and opening up, he has been doing the "reverse tricycle" business here. Due to good business, his three sons and daughter have also started their own shops, and he has hired a few helpers. His family has opened four individual vehicle shops, selling about 4,000 vehicles a year. He proudly said, "I can sell a hundred or two hundred vehicles a month. Even though I'm old, I can still earn tens of thousands of yuan a year."

However, it is worth noting that the rapid development of "reverse tricycles" has also brought some troublesome problems. Shenyang's per capita road occupancy is 3.5 square meters, while one "reverse tricycle" occupies 2 square meters. Its large-scale influx has exacerbated the "road wasteland" phenomenon. Especially since the "reverse tricycle" is all metal and not afraid of bumps, it often rushes and crashes on the road, making bicycles and cars afraid of it, becoming a bully on the road, often blocking traffic, causing headaches for the traffic department, and even leading to a special discussion by the Municipal Party Committee.

As the "reverse tricycle" develops, traffic management should keep up.

### 沈阳１０万“倒骑驴”

　　沈阳１０万“倒骑驴”
    新华社记者  刘欣欣  李玲
    沈阳一大怪：有路必有“倒骑驴”。
    所谓“倒骑驴”，是一种三轮脚踏车，二轮在前，人的坐骑在后，倒着骑。
    “倒骑驴”行当车用，停作摊床，随着多元经济的发展，如今已成为个体户不可缺少的运输工具。１９８０年以前，全市不过几千台，大都是工厂商店用。１０年光景，沈阳的个体业者发展到１８万人，“倒骑驴”也陡增到１３万多台。
    沈阳市民的生活已经离不开“倒骑驴”。在市中心的蔬菜批发市场，每天清晨６时左右，一台台“倒骑驴”从四面八方聚集这里，然后把几十万公斤蔬菜运送到全市几百个菜市场。市交通大队统计，一小时内进出此地的“倒骑驴”就有２５００台之多。在水果批发市场，每天也有２０００多辆“倒骑驴”光顾，运走十几车皮的梨、香蕉和蜜桔。
    目前，沈阳市出现了几十个“倒骑驴”运输市场，你要拉冰箱、洗衣机或是地毯、家具，招手一声就行，一般都不超过１０元钱，非常方便。
    在竞争激烈的货运市场，“倒骑驴”何以能生存和兴旺？一位车主道破奥妙：同三轮车比，它不仅容易驾驶，而且车身长、车架低、载货多。２５公斤一筐的桔子一车可以装二三十筐，两台就顶一辆“半截美”（一种客货两用汽车）。他说：“我们这些干个体的进货卖货都得有运输工具，能养得起汽车的有几个？可这３００多元一台的‘倒骑驴’谁都能买得起、养得起，它不吃草也不喝油，用着经济、方便。”
    “倒骑驴”家族的繁衍壮大，不仅活跃了城乡市场，而且为许多无职业者提供了谋生的饭碗，缓解了社会就业的压力。
    在水果批发站门前，一位妇女推着一车香蕉出来。她叫钟萍，今年４７岁。她不仅要养活有病不能劳动的丈夫和３个孩子，还得供养年迈的父母亲。“生活对我是太难了！”她向记者诉说：“不管天寒暑热，我每天都要来这里拉八九筐水果回去卖。每月可挣四五百块钱，全家吃饭就指靠这个‘驴’。不过这还是比以前‘大锅饭’时好多了。”
    社会对“倒骑驴”的需求刺激了制造业的发展。在皇姑区车辆交易市场，有卖轱辘的、钢管的，也有卖成车的，大中小号随意选购。６１岁的老工人杨连山是这里最有名的生产大户。他告诉记者，自打开放那阵他就开始在这里做“倒骑驴”买卖。由于生意不错，３个儿子、女儿也单挑门户干了起来，还请了几个帮手。他一家就开了４个个体车铺，一年里能售出４０００台。他颇为得意地说：“我每月都能卖个百八十台，别看老了，一年也能收入个万八千的。”
    不可忽视的是，“倒骑驴”的大发展也带来一些恼人的问题。沈阳市人均道路占有量是３．５平方米，而一台“倒骑驴”就占路２平方米，它的大量涌入加重了“路荒”现象。特别是由于“倒骑驴”浑身是铁，不怕磕碰，行驶时横冲直撞，自行车、汽车都怕它，成了马路上的一霸，时常阻塞交通，令交通部门大伤脑筋，以至市委常委会还为此进行了专门的讨论研究。随着“倒骑驴”的发展，交通管理应该跟上。
