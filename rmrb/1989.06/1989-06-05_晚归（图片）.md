The photograph "Returning Late" by Liu Jianwu captures a poignant moment of a young man returning home late at night. The image is taken from a low angle, emphasizing the solitude and fatigue of the subject. The streetlights cast long shadows, creating a sense of mystery and introspection. The photograph is a silent narrative of urban life, reflecting the struggles and resilience of individuals in a rapidly changing society.

The composition of the photograph is simple yet powerful. The central figure, dressed in dark clothing, stands out against the dimly lit background. His posture and expression convey a sense of weariness and determination. The surrounding environment, with its empty streets and distant lights, adds to the overall mood of the image.

Liu Jianwu's work often explores themes of urban isolation and the human condition. "Returning Late" is a testament to his ability to capture the essence of everyday life with a keen eye for detail and emotion. The photograph invites viewers to reflect on their own experiences and the universal human struggle for meaning and connection in a bustling world.

This photograph, published in the June 5, 1989, edition of the People's Daily, serves as a reminder of the enduring power of visual storytelling. In a time of significant social and political change, Liu Jianwu's work stands as a timeless portrayal of the human experience.
