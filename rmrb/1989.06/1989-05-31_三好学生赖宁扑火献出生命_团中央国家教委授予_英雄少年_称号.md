On March 13, 1988, a forest fire suddenly broke out on Mount Yingpan in Sichuan Province's Shimen County. To extinguish the fire, save the forest, and protect the safety of the ground satellite receiving station for television, Lai Ning, an excellent student from Shimen County Middle School, voluntarily joined the firefighting team. Lai Ning, during the firefighting efforts, disregarded his personal safety and fought continuously for four to five hours, sacrificing his precious life. He was only 14 years old.

To commend Lai Ning's noble spirit, the Communist Youth League Central Committee and the State Education Commission decided today to confer the title of "Heroic Youth" upon Lai Ning. They also called upon all levels of the Communist Youth League, Young Pioneers, and educational administrative departments to widely publicize Lai Ning's glorious deeds through various means. This is to educate the broad masses of young people to strive to become a new generation with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline in the great cause of promoting reform and building a modernized socialist society.
