Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 19th.

In recent days, the Party Committees of Tianjin, Shanghai, Fujian, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, Hainan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, Tibet, Gansu, Qinghai, and Ningxia have held expanded meetings of the Standing Committee and meetings of provincial-level department heads. They have seriously studied Deng Xiaoping's important speech on June 9th when he met with military officers above the rank of major from the capital's martial law troops. They unanimously expressed their full support and resolute implementation of the speech.

They believe that Deng Xiaoping's speech deeply analyzes the root causes, nature, and correctness of the decisions made by the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission regarding the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital. It is a powerful ideological weapon for thoroughly suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital and stabilizing the national situation. It has extremely important significance for uniting the thoughts of the entire Party and the people of the nation. Deng Xiaoping's speech also deeply expounds on the correctness of the line, principles, and policies formulated by our Party since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. It reaffirms the grand goal and development strategy of modernization construction and reaffirms the "one center, two basic points" summarized by the Thirteenth Party Congress. This has a very important guiding role for China's current and future reforms and construction.

In their study and discussion, they expressed that they would fully and deeply understand the essence of Deng Xiaoping's speech and use the spirit of the speech to guide their work. They believe that at present, they should use the spirit of Xiaoping's speech to unify their thoughts, understand the essence of this struggle, and correctly recognize the series of decisions made by the Party Central Committee in this struggle. They must continue to stabilize the situation and contribute to the thorough suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital with practical actions.

They pointed out that studying and implementing Xiaoping's important speech requires continuing to firmly implement the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. They must eliminate various doubts and more firmly implement the "one center, two basic points." They must use the Four Cardinal Principles to educate the people, students, all cadres, and Communist Party members. They must consciously resist bourgeois liberalization, oppose spiritual pollution, and firmly follow the Party Central Committee's leadership in walking the socialist path. At the same time, they must more practically grasp the reform and opening up and modernization construction.
