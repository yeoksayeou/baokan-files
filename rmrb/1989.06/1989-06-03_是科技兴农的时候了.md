If we say that the development of China's agriculture in the past 10 years has been led by policy, then in the current stage, it should be led by science and technology. It is time for "science and technology to revitalize agriculture"!

To achieve agricultural modernization, the basic characteristics are: the production technology system should be low-cost, high-yield, high-quality, and practical; the production structure should be reasonable, coordinated, self-improving, and have strong development functions; the production organization system should be open, socialized, commercialized, and high-efficiency; the agricultural ecosystem should be benign, stable, and have high material and energy conversion rates. To meet these requirements, the key lies in arming agriculture with scientific and technological advancements. In developed countries around the world, the role of science and technology in agriculture has already taken a dominant position. The speed and level of agricultural production development in the world today, to a large extent, depend on the speed and level of development of agricultural science and technology.

Science and technology can fully tap the potential of agricultural production. Summarized, it is mainly reflected in the following aspects:

Improving the efficiency of agricultural material inputs. Science and technology can make the composition of agricultural material inputs in a reasonable proportion, forming the best input system, achieving greater output with less input. For example, the use of formula fertilization technology can generally save 20-30% of chemical fertilizers, the application of compound feed can increase the feed return rate by 20-30%, and the use of pipeline irrigation technology can increase water utilization efficiency by 30-90% compared to flood irrigation, and so on.

Creating high-yield, high-quality, and stress-resistant new varieties of crops and livestock. For example, since the founding of the People's Republic, agricultural scientists have successfully bred new varieties of dwarf or hybrid rice, double-cross or single-cross hybrid corn, wheat resistant to rust or hybrid varieties, etc., resulting in 3-5 major variety replacements in grain crop production, each major replacement increasing yield by 10-30%, significantly improving crop yield and quality.

Strengthening the full and reasonable utilization of the five major growth factors of light, heat, water, air, and nutrients by agricultural organisms. For example, the film covering technology in high-cold, arid, and hilly areas, known as the "Food Security Project" and "White Revolution," the ridge cultivation, minimum tillage, and no-tillage technology in southern rice fields, the factory-style technology for vegetable seedling cultivation or poultry breeding, and the intensive net cage aquaculture technology in large and medium-sized lakes and reservoirs, can all, to a certain extent, coordinate the dynamic changes of light, heat, water, air, and nutrients in nature, adapt to and meet the growth needs of animals and plants, and promote a multiple increase in agricultural yield per unit area.

In regional agricultural comprehensive development, it is necessary to rely on science and technology. Because a high-level agricultural system includes the ten major industries of agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, sideline production, fishery, industry, commerce, transportation, construction, and services in the entire rural area, this is a complex and extensive system. To achieve comprehensive and coordinated development in a region, it is necessary to rely on modern natural and social sciences, promote the cross-penetration and horizontal cooperation of multiple disciplines and specialties, correctly handle the relationship between comprehensive development and environmental protection, short-term benefits and long-term benefits, micro-benefits and macro-benefits, and propose scientific agricultural comprehensive development implementation plans.

How can agricultural development rely on science and technology? First, it is necessary to rely on the 5 million agricultural science and technology personnel from the central to local levels. This includes agricultural scientific researchers, agricultural technology extension personnel, farmer science and technology households and professional households, and leaders of agricultural administrative departments. Only by mobilizing the enthusiasm of these four types of people can the relay of "science-technology-production-benefits" be ensured.

Second, it is necessary to create a good social environment for science and technology to revitalize agriculture. In terms of awareness, it is necessary for all levels of leadership departments to fully realize the urgency and strategic significance of developing agriculture through scientific and technological progress, and to promote various social strata to care for and support the development of agricultural science and technology, mobilizing other scientific and technological departments to participate in agricultural scientific and technological development. In terms of investment, currently, the national agricultural research funds account for only 3-4% of the national research funds, which is equivalent to about 0.1% of the total agricultural output value. Therefore, when the state increases its investment in agriculture, it should regard the investment in agricultural science and technology as an important component and increase its proportion. In terms of policy, the state has already formulated a series of incentive policies for scientific and technological personnel, but due to the underdevelopment of the agricultural technology market, it is difficult to provide paid services to farmers, agricultural science and technology units find it hard to generate income, and there are many restrictive factors in implementing various incentive policies. Therefore, it is necessary to formulate special incentive policies and regulations. Only in this way can science and technology revitalize agriculture have great hope.

    是科技兴农的时候了
    刘志澄　刘寄陵
    如果说前10年我国农业的发展是以政策为先导，那么现阶段就应该以科技为先导，是“科技兴农”的时候了！
    实现农业现代化，基本特征是：生产技术系统要低耗、高产、优质和适用；生产结构要合理、协调、自我完善和发展功能强；生产组织系统要开放、社会化、商品化和高效益；农业生态系统要良性、稳定，物质和能量转换率高。要达到这些要求，关键在于用科学技术武装农业。世界上发达国家的农业，科学技术的作用已占居主导地位。当今世界农业生产发展的速度和水平，在很大程度上取决于农业科学技术发展的速度和水平。
    科学技术能全面挖掘农业增产潜力。概括起来主要体现在以下方面：
    提高农业物质投入的效率。科学技术可以使农业物质投入组成合适的比例，构成最佳的投入系统，以较少的投入取得较大的产出。如采用配方施肥技术一般可节约化肥2—3成，应用配合饲料可使饲料报酬率提高20—30％，采用管道输水技术比大水漫灌提高水分利用率30—90％等等。
    创造高产、优质、抗逆性强的作物畜禽新品种。如建国以来农业科学家培育成功了水稻矮化或杂交新品种、玉米的双交或单交杂交种、小麦的抗锈或杂交新品种等，使粮食作物生产中进行过3—5次品种大更换，每次大更换都增产10—30％，大幅度提高了作物产量和质量。
    加强农业生物对光、热、水、气、养分五大生长要素的充分合理利用。如高寒、干旱、山丘地区被誉为“温饱工程”、“白色革命”的地膜覆盖技术，南方稻田的垄作少耕免耕技术，蔬菜育苗或家禽饲养的工厂化技术，大中型湖泊、水库的集约化网箱养鱼技术等，都能在一定程度上协调自然界光、热、水、气和养分的动态变化，适应和满足动植物生长的需要，促使农业单产成倍增长。
    在区域农业综合开发中，必须依靠科学技术。因为高层次的农业系统包括整个农村中农、林、牧、副、渔、工、商、运、建、服十大产业，这是一个内容繁杂、牵涉面广的庞大系统。要使一个地区全面增产和协调发展，需要依靠现代自然科学和社会科学，促进多学科多专业交叉渗透和横向协作，正确处理好综合开发与环境保护、短期效益与长期效益、微观效益与宏观效益之间的关系，才能提出科学的农业综合开发实施方案。
    农业发展如何依靠科技？一是要紧紧依靠从中央到地方500万农业科研和技术推广队伍。其中包括农业科研人员、农技推广人员、农民科技户和专业户以及农业行政部门领导干部。把这四类人的积极性发挥出来，才能使“科学—技术—生产—效益”的接力不致中断。
    二是为科技兴农创造个良好社会环境。从认识上看，要使各级领导部门充分意识到发展农业依靠科技进步的迫切性和重大战略意义，并推动社会各阶层关心和支持农业科学技术的发展，动员其它科技部门力量投入农业科技开发。从投入上看，目前全国农业科研经费仅占国家科研经费的3—4％，只相当于农业总产值的0.1％左右，因此国家在增加农业投入时，应该把对农业科技投入作为一个重要组成部分，提高其投入比重。从政策上看，目前国家已对科技人员制订了一系列鼓励政策，但由于农业技术市场不发达，对农民有偿服务较难，农业科技单位不易创收，实施各种鼓励政策的限制因素太多，因此，有必要制订专门的鼓励政策和法规。只有这样，科技兴农才大有希望。
