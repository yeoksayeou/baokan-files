The US-Soviet nuclear weapons and space weapons talks, which had been suspended for seven months, resumed on June 19 in Geneva. According to the progress of the talks, the main agenda after the resumption is to continue drafting a treaty for mutual reduction of strategic weapons by 50% by the US and the Soviet Union. This treaty has been discussed for a long time, but there are still many issues that have not been settled, and from the current situation, it is unlikely that all issues will be resolved in the short term.

The negotiations on strategic weapons are an important part of the comprehensive nuclear and space weapons arms reduction talks between the US and the Soviet Union. Since the talks began in 1985, they have gone through a tortuous process over five years. However, since the US-Soviet summit in Reykjavik in October 1986, which agreed in principle to reduce offensive strategic weapons by 50% for both sides, significant progress has been made. The general framework of the treaty to reduce strategic weapons has been basically determined, with the main contents including: both sides agree to reduce the number of strategic weapon delivery vehicles (i.e., land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and long-range strategic bombers) to 1,600 units, and the number of strategic weapon warheads to 6,000; within this total limit, both sides also agree to limit the warheads of intercontinental and submarine ballistic missiles to 4,900, of which the warheads of heavy missiles should not exceed 1,540; both sides also agree to use the verification principles of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty signed in December 1987 as the basis for drafting three verification documents related to strategic weapons. From the content of the treaty, this is only an initial agreement, and many outstanding issues need to be further negotiated and resolved. It is against this background that the negotiators from the US and the Soviet Union resumed their work in Geneva on June 19.

After entering a new round of nuclear arms reduction talks, the US and the Soviet Union face a dual task: one is to seek solutions to the original disagreements, and the other is to address new issues that may arise during the talks. The original disagreements are mainly concentrated in three areas: First, what kind of restrictions should be imposed on the three types of strategic weapons. The US and the Soviet Union currently have different compositions of strategic weapons. The Soviet Union has an advantage in land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, while the US has an advantage in sea and air nuclear forces. Therefore, in the negotiations, the US has proposed more restrictions on land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, especially on the Soviet Union's heavy and mobile missiles. During the Reagan administration, in addition to demanding the regulation of the number of land-based missile warheads, the US also proposed banning the SS-24 and SS-25 mobile missiles already deployed by the Soviet Union, which was rejected by the Soviet Union. Now, the Bush administration has decided to develop the MX and Dwarf mobile missiles, so it is unclear whether the US will change its stance on banning mobile missiles, as Congress has not yet made a funding decision. On the other hand, the Soviet Union demands restrictions on the US's sea and air nuclear forces, such as regulating the number of submarine missile warheads, determining the calculation principles for cruise missiles carried by bombers, and limiting the number of sea-launched cruise missiles, etc., to which the US has not agreed and has remained undecided. Second, the verification issue. The verification of strategic weapons is more complex than that of intermediate-range missiles. Many details have not yet been determined, and now the US is planning to propose a new initiative, that is, to conduct experimental verification before completing the drafting of the treaty to ensure the reliability of the verification measures. Some people here are concerned that this may make the talks more complicated and unnecessarily delay the progress of the talks. Third, the relationship between the strategic weapons treaty and the compliance with the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty, which is essentially the fundamental disagreement between the two sides on the strategic defense issue, has been a major point of contention between the US and the Soviet Union over the past few years. Now, the US still emphasizes the need to continue researching and deploying "a more comprehensive defense system," and it seems that the disagreement in this area still exists.

Since the Bush administration took office, it has conducted a comprehensive review of the nuclear arms reduction talks, but from the current situation, the US Congress has not yet made clear decisions on the many issues in the strategic weapons treaty. It is said that the US wants to see what new proposals the Soviet Union will make and then comment on them. President Bush recently proposed at the NATO summit to accelerate the progress of conventional forces talks and strive to reach an agreement within a year, but he has not yet expressed his attitude towards the nuclear talks. Some newspapers here believe that the US may currently focus on reaching an agreement on conventional forces, while not being in a hurry to reach a nuclear treaty. The new US government has repeatedly stated that it will not make fundamental changes to the framework of the previously agreed strategic weapons treaty, but it emphasizes that it may propose some important modifications. Therefore, it is expected that the new round of US-Soviet nuclear arms reduction talks may not be as clear-cut as originally estimated in the short term.

### 美苏核裁军谈判进入新回合

　　美苏核裁军谈判进入新回合
    本报记者  张启昕
    美苏核武器和太空武器谈判在休会７个月后，又于６月１９日在日内瓦复会。按照谈判的进展情况，复会后的谈判的主要议题是继续拟订一项美苏各自裁减战略武器５０％的条约。此项条约双方已经讨论过许久，但仍留下不少问题尚未谈妥，而且从当前的迹象看，短时间内也未必能完全谈妥。
    关于战略武器的谈判是美苏核武器和太空武器一揽子裁军谈判的重要组成部分，自１９８５年谈判开始以来已有５个年头，经历了曲折的过程。但自从１９８６年１０月美苏首脑在冰岛会晤原则上确定美苏各自削减进攻性战略武器５０％之后，双方取得了不小进展，大体上确定了削减战略武器条约的轮廓，其主要内容包括：双方同意把各自现有的战略武器运载工具（即陆基洲际导弹、潜艇发射的弹道导弹和远程战略轰炸机）从数量上减少到１６００件，战略武器的核弹头减少到６０００个；在这个总限额内，双方还同意把洲际和潜艇弹道导弹的弹头限制在４９００个之内，其中重型导弹的弹头不超过１５４０个；双方还同意以１９８７年１２月签订的中程导弹条约的核查原则为基础，制订三个有关战略武器的核查文件。从条约的内容看，这只是一项初步的协议，许多遗留问题需要继续谈判解决，正是在这种背景下，本月１９日美苏两国谈判代表在日内瓦重新开始了工作。
    美苏核裁军谈判进入新的回合后，面临着双重任务，一是寻求解决原来留存下来的分歧，二是处理谈判中可能产生的新的问题。原有分歧大致集中在三个方面：一是对三种战略武器分别实行何种限制。美苏双方现有的战略武器构成不同，苏联的优势在陆基洲际导弹方面，而美国则在海、空核力量方面占上风，因此在谈判中，美国对陆基洲际导弹尤其是对苏联的重型导弹和机动导弹提出的限制较多。在里根执政时期，美国除了要求规定陆基导弹弹头的数量外，还曾提出禁止苏联已经部署的ＳＳ—２４和ＳＳ—２５两种机动导弹，遭到苏联的拒绝。现在布什政府已决定要发展ＭＸ和侏儒两种机动导弹，因此美国是否要改变禁止机动导弹的立场，由于国会还未作出拨款决定，态度尚不明朗。而另一方面，苏联则要求对美国的海、空核力量作出限制，例如规定潜艇导弹弹头的数量，确定轰炸机装载巡航导弹的计算原则、限制海上巡航导弹的数量等等，美国也未作出允诺，一直悬而未决。其二是核查问题。战略武器的核查要比中程导弹复杂。本来许多细节尚未确定，现在美国还打算提出一个新的主张，即在完成条约的起草工作前，先进行试验性核查，以确保核查措施的可靠性。此间人士担心，这有可能使谈判更趋复杂，不必要地拖延谈判进程。三是战略武器条约与遵守反导弹条约的关系问题，这实质上是双方在战略防御问题上的根本分歧，是过去几年中美苏争执不休的重要分歧之一。现在美国仍强调要继续研究和部署“更为全面的防御体系”，看来，这方面的分歧依然存在。
    布什政府执政以来，曾对核裁军谈判过程进行了全面回顾，但从目前情况看，美国国会还没有对战略武器条约中存在的诸多问题作出明确决定，据说美国想看看苏联会有什么新的建议，然后再作议论。布什总统前不久曾在北约首脑会议上提出要加速常规力量谈判的进程，争取在１年内达成协议，但对核谈判却还未表明态度，此间报纸据此认为，美国目前可能把重点放在达成常规力量的协议上，而对核条约则并不急于求成。美国新政府还一再表示它将不对原先商定的战略武器条约的框架作根本的变动，但强调有可能提出某些重要修改。因此，人们预料，新的回合的美苏核裁军谈判可能不像原先估计的那样能在短时间内见到分晓。
