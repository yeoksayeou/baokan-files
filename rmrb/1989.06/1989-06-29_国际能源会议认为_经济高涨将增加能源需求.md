The three-day International Energy Conference concluded yesterday in Caracas. The conference held that the current global economic boom will drive increased demand for energy.

During the conference, experts and scholars from various countries discussed the prospects for energy in the next decade, trends in the oil market, the future role of OPEC, and environmental protection. At the conclusion of the conference yesterday, the current chairman of the International Energy Association, the head of the Venezuelan Petroleum Company, Mr. Barra, gave a brief summary to the press. He pointed out that the global economic boom reflects the continuous growth in energy demand. From a long-term perspective, economic growth requires greater stability in the energy market, and this provides an opportunity for such stability. Therefore, people need to change their approach to considering energy issues.

At this conference, some experts pointed out that in the next decade and for a considerable period into the next century, although natural gas, nuclear power, hydroelectric power, and other energy sources will increase, oil will still dominate all energy sources. In the past three years, global oil reserves have increased by 40%, reaching 99 billion barrels. Venezuelan experts believe that this can guarantee a sufficient supply of oil for the next 50 years. Other experts noted that over the past 30 years, energy consumption in OECD countries has shown a downward trend, while energy consumption in developing countries has continued to expand. Therefore, in the next century, developing countries will become an important energy market.

　　国际能源会议认为    
    经济高涨将增加能源需求
    本报加拉斯加６月２９日电  记者朱满庭报道：为期３天的国际能源会议于昨天在加拉加斯结束，会议认为当前世界经济的高涨将带动对能源的更大需求。
    会议期间，各国专家学者就下一个十年中能源的前景、石油市场的走向、欧佩克未来的地位和环境保护等问题展开了讨论，在昨天会议结束时，国际能源协会现任主席、委内瑞拉石油公司的领导人巴拉向报界作了一个简短的小结。他在小结中指出，世界经济的高涨反映在对能源的需求不断增长，从长期观点看，经济增长需要能源市场更大程度的稳定，也为这种稳定提供了机会，这就要求人们改变考虑能源问题的方式。
    在这次会议上，一些专家指出，在今后的十年以至下个世纪的一个相当长的时间内，尽管天然气、核能、水电等能源都有所增加，但石油仍将在所有能源中占主导地位。在最近的３年内，世界石油储量提高了４０％，目前已达到９９００亿桶。委内瑞拉专家认为，这可以保证在未来５０年内石油的充分供应。还有的专家指出，最近３０年来，经合组织国家的能源消费已出现下降趋势，而发展中国家的能源消费则不断扩大，因此，下一个世纪发展中国家将成为重要的能源市场。
