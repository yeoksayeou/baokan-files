The Propaganda Department's Bureau of Literature and Art today convened a discussion with some comrades from the literary and artistic circles to study Deng Xiaoping's speech. The attendees unanimously agreed that Deng Xiaoping's speech will serve as a guiding document for a considerable period of time, holding significant real-world and historical importance.

In light of the actual situation in the literary and artistic circles over the past decade, everyone agreed that the Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the nation and also the foundation for developing socialist literature and art. The literary and artistic circles have achieved significant progress over the past decade, with the majority of comrades supporting the Party's leadership and socialism. However, in recent years, the literary and artistic circles have indeed seen many confused ideas and theories, primarily due to the lack of consistent adherence to the Four Cardinal Principles and the opposition to bourgeois liberalization. Those who genuinely uphold Marxism are often labeled as ultra-leftists or dogmatic, while some who advocate for bourgeois liberalization are hailed as heroes leading new trends. This has led to an outbreak of irrational, antisocial, and immoral trends in the literary and artistic circles. This lesson is indeed worth serious reflection. For the literary and artistic circles, it is essential to follow Deng Xiaoping's words and calmly consider both the past and the future. The current urgent task is to thoroughly study Deng Xiaoping's important speech and relevant documents from the Central Committee, further clarify the nature and significance of this struggle, and, in conjunction with actual conditions, truly grasp the intrinsic dialectical relationship between upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and implementing reform and opening up. On this basis, it is necessary to calmly review the past, clarify the various confused ideas influenced by bourgeois liberalization, distinguish the important theoretical right from wrong that has been distorted by the liberalization trend, and draw painful lessons from the leadership work on the literary and artistic front. At the same time, in new practices, it is essential to strengthen the construction of thought and theory with new content for the times, take new steps in developing Marxist aesthetics and literary theory, and strive to reinforce the main melody of artistic creation that truly reflects the spirit of our times. Only in this way can the market for bourgeois liberalization trends gradually shrink, enabling the work on the literary and artistic front to play its due role in maintaining the country's long-term stability and prosperity and building socialist spiritual civilization.

　　中宣部文艺局召集部分同志座谈邓小平讲话    
    文艺界应冷静思考过去未来  学好有关文件澄清思想混乱
    据新华社北京６月２４日电  中宣部文艺局今天召集文艺界部分同志学习座谈邓小平同志的讲话。与会同志一致认为，邓小平同志的讲话，在相当长的历史时期内是我们工作的纲领性文件，具有重要的现实意义和历史意义。
    联系文艺界多年来的实际情况，大家认为，四项基本原则是立国之本，也是发展社会主义文艺之本。文艺界１０年来取得了很大的成绩，文艺界大多数同志是拥护党的领导、拥护社会主义的。但是，这几年来文艺界在思想上、理论上确也出现了许多混乱现象，主要原因就是没有一贯地坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化。真正坚持马克思主义的同志往往被斥之为极左、僵化，有些鼓吹资产阶级自由化的人却被吹捧为领导新潮流的“英雄”，以至于在文艺界非理性、非社会、非道德的思潮一时泛滥成灾。这一教训确实值得认真总结。对文艺界来说，应当按照邓小平同志所讲的，要冷静地考虑过去，也要冷静地考虑未来。现在的当务之急是要认真学习邓小平同志的重要讲话和中央有关文件，进一步弄清这场斗争的性质和意义，并联系实际情况，真正把握坚持四项基本原则和实行改革开放的内在辩证统一关系。在此基础上，要冷静地回顾过去，澄清资产阶级自由化思潮影响下的各种思想混乱，辨明被自由化思潮扭曲了的重要理论是非，并从文艺战线的领导工作上吸取沉痛的经验教训。与此同时，要在新的实践中，大力加强有新的时代内容的思想理论建设，在发展马克思主义美学和文艺学方面迈出新步伐，并且努力强化真正能体现我们时代精神的文艺创作的主旋律。只有这样，才能逐步缩小资产阶级自由化思潮的市场，使文艺战线的工作在维护国家的长治久安，建设社会主义精神文明中发挥应有的作用。
