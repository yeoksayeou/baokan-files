In the counter-revolutionary riot that occurred in Beijing, the broad masses of the people, disregarding their personal safety, bravely risked danger to protect a batch of armed police officers.

On the night of June 3rd at 10 PM, several hundred armed police officers from a certain unit were ordered to a certain intersection to carry out their duties. They were surrounded and beaten by thugs, and although some comrades continued to advance, the remaining several hundred injured officers were besieged. In this critical moment, the local residents bravely rushed to their rescue, saving them from further harm and eventually helping them retreat to a certain unit. More than 20 cadres and staff members of that unit spontaneously formed a medical rescue team, bandaging and rescuing over 150 injured officers. The next morning, the Party Secretary of that unit, along with other leaders, visited the injured officers, bringing 5 boxes of fresh orange juice, 10 packs of cigarettes, and over 30 blankets. They also solved the problem of food and accommodation for the injured officers.

A certain alley is a dead end. When the scattered officers retreated here, the vicious thugs blocked the alley entrance with vehicles. Then, bricks and glass bottles rained down like hail. At this critical moment, the residents, each contributing a few people from their households, hid all the armed police officers. They cooked meals for the officers, bandaged their wounds, and provided nutritional supplements like royal jelly and milk powder to the injured. For those who were severely injured and couldn't move, they fed them spoon by spoon.

　　北京广大群众挺身而出
  　紧急关头保护武警官兵
    本报北京６月１６日讯  在北京发生的反革命暴乱中，广大人民群众置个人安危于不顾，冒着危险，保护了一批武警官兵。
    ６月３日晚１０时，某部数百名武警官兵奉命到某路口执行任务，受到歹徒的围攻和殴打，除部分同志继续前进外，其余数百名伤员被围困。在危急情况下，附近地区的群众冒死相救，使他们免遭更大的伤害，终于撤进某单位。该单位的２０多名干部职工自发组成了医疗救护小组，包扎、抢救伤员１５０多人。第２天上午，这个单位的党委书记又带领有关领导看望伤员，带来５箱鲜桔汁、１０条香烟及３０多条棉被，并解决了伤员的食宿问题。
    某胡同是条死胡同，当被冲散的官兵退到这里后，穷凶极恶的歹徒用车堵死胡同口。接着，砖头、玻璃瓶如雨点般飞来。在这关头，居民们你家两个，我家三个，把武警官兵全部隐藏起来。他们给官兵们做饭，包扎伤口，拿出蜂王浆、奶粉等营养品给伤员。重伤员不能动，他们就一勺一勺地喂。　　（钟长洪）
