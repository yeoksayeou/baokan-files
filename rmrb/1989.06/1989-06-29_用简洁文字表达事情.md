A campaign aimed at making language more concise is underway in Britain, with the slogan: "Avoid complexity," "Express things in the simplest way."

Since 1981, an organization with ten members has conducted 250 training courses for local authorities, businesses, and government agencies. In addition, they have provided correspondence courses by mailing teaching materials to users.

They teach students not to use too many long sentences and to express themselves in the active voice as much as possible. For example, "We cannot send money" is more understandable than "Money cannot be sent by us." They suggest that a sentence should ideally be between 15 to 20 words long and advocate the use of everyday language.

In addition to the above measures, the organization has collaborated with a public finance research institution to produce a large amount of promotional materials to help the public better understand their advocacy.

"We are launching this campaign to save wood," said one of the organizers, Mrs. Maher: "Every day, tons of verbose and incomprehensible materials are printed and end up in the wastepaper basket. The public will not read things they cannot understand."

　　用简洁文字表达事情
    付迎斌
    一场旨在使文字简洁的运动正在英国展开，提出的口号是：“避免复杂”，“用最简洁的方式来表达事情。”
    自１９８１年以来，一个拥有十名成员的组织已经为地方当局、商业界和政府机关开设了２５０门训练课程。除此之外，他们还采取函授的方式给用户邮寄教材。
    他们教导学生不要使用太多长句子，尽量用主动语态的方式来表达，例如：“我们不能送钱”就比“钱不能被我们送”要易懂一些。他们建议一个句子长短最好在１５至２０个单字之间，并且提倡多用日常口语。
    除了上述措施，这个组织还同一个公共金融研究机构合作印发了大量宣传材料，以便使公众更加明确地了解他们的主张。
    “我们开展这场运动是为了节约木材”，组织者之一玛赫夫人说：“每天有成吨的罗罗嗦嗦只配进废纸箱的东西被印刷出来。公众不会去读那些他们看不懂的东西。”
