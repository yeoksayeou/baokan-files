The State Education Commission issues a notice to the education commissions, higher education bureaus, and education departments of all provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and municipalities with separate plans, as well as directly affiliated universities:

In view of the current situation in the capital and some other parts of the country, the State Education Commission solemnly notifies all teachers, students, and staff of universities nationwide, as well as all educational administrative departments and sectors of society:

1. All Communist Party members, cadres, and teachers, students, and staff in universities and educational administrative departments must seriously study the "Notice to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Entire Nation by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council," and make efforts to stabilize the situation and restore and maintain normal order in schools at all levels.

2. Teachers, students, and staff in universities should remain calm, sober, and rational, abide by the Constitution, legal system, and relevant regulations of the local people's government, assist schools in maintaining order on campus, and protect school property.

3. Universities should do their utmost to create conditions to restore normal teaching order. When conditions are met, they should resume classes as soon as possible. Faculty and staff should stay at their posts and fulfill their duties to ensure the resumption of classes.

4. After universities resume classes, they should strictly implement the student enrollment management system, ensure teaching quality, and help students make up for the academic losses that have already occurred.

5. Universities should strive to carry out enrollment and graduate student allocation and dispatch work as planned and on schedule. For graduating students who do not meet the requirements, the state will not be responsible for their job allocation, and they should leave school within a specified period.

6. For the small number of individuals who continue to incite and organize external connections and obstruct the restoration of normal order in schools, they should be exposed. Measures should be taken to resolutely stop their activities that disrupt normal teaching order and endanger social stability. Those who do not mend their ways after education should be dealt with according to laws and school regulations, and should not be tolerated.

7. Various sectors of society and student parents, with a sense of responsibility to the country and to the students, should consider the overall situation, help universities restore normal teaching order, and have done a lot of work. The State Education Commission expresses its thanks and hopes that all sectors of society will continue to assist schools in this work.

8. Due to the occurrence of a counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, some universities cannot temporarily restore normal order. Relevant matters will be notified separately. If individual universities in other places encounter special situations and need to make flexible arrangements, they must obtain the approval of the competent department and report to the educational administrative department of the province (municipality, autonomous region) where they are located, and also report to the State Education Commission for the record.
