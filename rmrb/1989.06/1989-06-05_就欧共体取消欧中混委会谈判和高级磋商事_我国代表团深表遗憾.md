On the cancellation of the EU-China Joint Committee negotiations and high-level consultations, China's delegation expresses deep regret.

BEIJING, June 5 (Xinhua) -- Today at noon, the Chinese delegation, which came to participate in the 10th session of the China-EU Joint Committee negotiations, expressed great indignation over the EU's news release that distorted the facts. The delegation also expressed deep regret over the chairman's cancellation of today's Joint Committee negotiations and tomorrow's high-level consultations.

The Chinese delegation believes that this session of the Joint Committee was agreed upon by both sides in October last year. Unilaterally terminating it will result in consequences that damage bilateral relations, for which the EU Commission should be fully responsible.

The Chinese delegation reiterated that since implementing the policy of reform and opening up, China's economic and foreign trade systems have undergone profound changes. The Chinese government attaches great importance to developing long-term, stable trade and economic cooperation with the EU. China will continue to adhere to the policy of reform and opening up.

　　就欧共体取消欧中混委会谈判和高级磋商事
    我国代表团深表遗憾
    本报布鲁塞尔６月５日电  记者魏崴报道：今天中午，前来参加第十届中国—欧共体混合委员会谈判的中国代表团，对欧共体当日发的新闻公报歪曲实事真相，表示极大愤慨，对委员会主席取消５日的混委会谈判和６日的高级磋商，深表遗憾。
    我国代表团认为，本届混委会是双方去年１０月间一致商定的，现在单方面中止，由此引起的损害双边关系的后果应完全由欧共体委员会负责。
    我国代表团重申，自实行开放和改革政策以来，我国的经济和外贸体制已发生了深刻变化。中国政府十分重视同欧共体发展长期稳定的贸易和经济合作关系。中国将一如既往地坚持执行开放和改革政策。
