The notice states: Since mid-April, a small number of people have taken advantage of the patriotic enthusiasm of young students and the public's dissatisfaction with certain mistakes in our work to deliberately create political turmoil, attempting to achieve their political goal of denying the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system. In this serious political struggle concerning the destiny of the state and the nation, the vast majority of public security officers, armed police, and security personnel have stood firm, held high their banners, and resolutely supported the decisions of the Party Central Committee, demonstrating a high level of political awareness and strong organizational discipline. Wherever turmoil occurred, public security officers, armed police, and security personnel have performed their duties, considered the overall situation, borne hardships, and fought day and night on the front lines of the struggle. They have done their utmost to maintain public order, direct traffic, protect key departments and headquarters, and promptly crack down on criminal activities, playing an important role in suppressing turmoil and restoring normal social order.

The notice lists the achievements of public security officers, armed police, and security personnel:

1. Leaders have taken the lead, and the vast majority of public security officers, armed police, and security personnel have worked day and night, continuously fighting and performing their duties. In the struggle to suppress turmoil, leaders at all levels of public security organs and armed police forces have taken the lead, with a high sense of responsibility, carefully organizing and deploying, going deep into the scene to command, promptly grasping information, and properly handling various problems encountered. The vast majority of officers and security personnel have considered the big picture and the overall situation, setting aside personal difficulties. Many comrades have worked while sick, and some, despite being old and weak, have insisted on working. To encourage the fighting spirit of on-duty officers and ensure the living conditions of on-duty officers, comrades engaged in political work and logistics have worked overtime, doing their best to eliminate the worries of the vast majority of officers on duty.

2. Obeying orders, following commands, guarding posts, and maintaining discipline. All on-duty officers and armed police have faced complex situations, consciously obeying superior commands, maintaining discipline, remaining calm, and doing their best to avoid bloodshed, creating conditions for properly handling the situation.

3. Strengthening information work, grasping social dynamics, and promptly providing bases for leadership decisions.

4. Promptly cracking down on criminal activities, protecting key positions and headquarters, and striving to maintain social order. In various places, some lawbreakers have taken advantage of student marches and petitions to attack party and government organs, disrupt social order, and engage in beating, smashing, looting, and arson. For such incidents, public security officers and armed police in various places have taken swift action and dealt with them decisively, arresting a number of criminals engaged in beating, smashing, looting, and arson.

The notice states: "In more than a month of intense struggle, the vast majority of public security officers, armed police, and security personnel have made significant contributions to maintaining the normal social order and stable political situation in the capital and the country, and have made new achievements for the Party, the country, and the people. They have received praise from the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and various levels of party and government leaders, as well as the broad masses. For this, the Ministry of Public Security specially issues this notice of commendation and requests that public security organs, armed police forces, and relevant departments and schools in various places commend and reward public security, security, and armed police personnel who have made achievements.

"At present, the situation has not yet been resolved, and the struggle is still developing. It is hoped that all public security officers, armed police, and security personnel will continue to study the important speeches of Comrade Li Peng and Comrade Yang Shangkun at the Central and Beijing Municipal Party and Government Cadres Conference, further clarify the nature of this struggle, and in accordance with the deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, under the leadership of local party committees and governments, remain confident, continue to strive, and closely cooperate with the People's Liberation Army to make new contributions to the complete suppression of turmoil, the smooth implementation of rectification and adjustment, the deepening of reform, and economic construction."
