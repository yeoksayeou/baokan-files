The Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, and East Germany Welcome Bush's Proposals for Arms Reduction

Soviet and East German officials have welcomed U.S. President George H.W. Bush's recent proposals for arms reduction, describing them as a step forward, although they noted that some issues still need to be studied.

Soviet Army Deputy Chief of Staff Colonel-General Kuklyov said today that Bush's proposals are "a step forward," but added that some issues still need to be examined.

At a press conference, Kuklyov said that the number of tanks, armored vehicles, and artillery pieces that Bush proposed to reduce is "in line with or close to" the figures proposed by the Warsaw Pact.

The Soviet general noted that Bush proposed to reduce all land-based combat aircraft, while the Warsaw Pact advocates reducing only the types of aircraft where NATO has an advantage and which are more suited for launching surprise attacks.

On May 29, Bush proposed at the NATO summit in Brussels to reduce the number of Soviet and American troops in Europe to 275,000 each. Kuklyov said that since this proposal does not include British and French troops in West Germany (more than 100,000), NATO would gain a unilateral advantage. He said that the Soviet Union will "carefully and thoroughly study" Bush's proposals.

People's Daily, Paris, May 31st.

Our correspondent Zhang Qihua reports: Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard Shevardnadze, who came to Paris to attend the CSCE human rights conference, said yesterday that the Soviet Union is prepared to negotiate with the United States on Bush's new proposals for arms reduction.

He believes that Bush's four-point plan for reducing conventional forces in the East and West, proposed at the NATO summit, reflects a "change in the U.S. attitude" and is "a serious and significant step in the right direction."

He said, "The Soviet representatives in Vienna are prepared to seriously discuss the U.S. proposals." However, the foreign minister also pointed out that studying the U.S. proposals will take time.

Xinhua News Agency, Prague, May 31st.

The Czechoslovakian newspaper "Red Right" published a commentary on May 31st, stating that Bush's four-point proposal for arms reduction "meets the demands of the times" and helps to "strengthen European peace and security."

The commentary said that the U.S. president's four-point proposal for arms reduction is the most significant event at the NATO summit, marking the first time the West has "specifically responded to Moscow's peace initiatives."

Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, May 30th.

The spokesperson for the East German Foreign Ministry, Meyer, said on May 30th that East Germany is "thoroughly" studying U.S. President Bush's proposals for conventional arms reduction made at the NATO summit and welcomes any steps that help with arms reduction.

He said that the direction of Bush's proposals is correct, and East Germany welcomes any steps that promote arms control and reduction.

According to the German News Agency, the spokesperson emphasized that large-scale reductions in conventional arms make it more necessary to immediately conduct negotiations on tactical nuclear weapons.

　　苏捷民德欢迎布什裁军建议
    新华社莫斯科５月３０日电  （记者王宪举）苏军总参谋部副局长库克廖夫今天说，美国总统布什的裁军建议是“向前迈出了一步”，但是，有些问题还需要研究。
    库克廖夫在记者招待会上说，布什建议削减的坦克、装甲车和大炮的数量与华约组织提出削减的数字“相符合或者接近”。
    这位苏军少将指出，布什建议削减所有陆基作战飞机，而华约组织则主张只削减北约占优势的易于发动突然袭击的进攻性作战飞机。
    布什２９日在布鲁塞尔举行的北约国家首脑会议上还建议将苏联和美国驻欧洲部队各裁减到２７．５万人。库克廖夫说，由于这一建议不把英国和法国驻联邦德国部队（１０多万人）计算在内，所以北约组织将取得单方面的优势。他说，苏联将“仔细而深入地研究”布什的建议。
    本报巴黎５月３１日电　记者张启华报道：为出席欧安会人权会议来到巴黎的苏联外长谢瓦尔德纳泽昨天在巴黎说，苏联准备就布什总统提出的新裁军建议同美国进行谈判。
    他认为，布什总统在北约首脑会议上提出的东西方裁减常规力量四点计划的建议反映了美国“态度的变化”，是“朝着好的方向迈出认真、重大的一步”。
    他说，“苏联在维也纳的谈判代表准备认真讨论美国的建议。”不过，这位外长同时指出，研究美国提出的建议需要时间。
    新华社布拉格５月３１日电　捷克斯洛伐克《红色权利报》３１日发表评论，称布什总统提出的四点裁军建议“符合时代的要求”，有助于“加强欧洲和平与安全”。
    评论说，美国总统的四点裁军建议是北大西洋公约组织首脑会议上的最重大事情，这是西方首次“对莫斯科提出的和平倡议的具体回答”。
    新华社柏林５月３０日电　民主德国外交部发言人迈耶３０日表示，民德正在“透彻地”研究美国总统布什在北约首脑会晤上提出的常规裁军建议，并对任何有助于裁军的步骤表示欢迎。
    他说，布什总统所提的建议的方向是正确的，民主德国欢迎任何有助于促进军备控制和裁军的步骤。
    据德通社报道，这位发言人强调，大规模裁减常规军备使关于战术核武器谈判的立即进行显得更加必要。
