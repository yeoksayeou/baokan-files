Recently, to maintain social order and protect the "three summer" period, the public security organs of Henan Province organized a concentrated and unified action focusing on cracking down on transient criminals. Several notorious, wanted, and long-sought transient criminals have been apprehended. This is the second major concentrated and unified action by the public security organs of Henan Province, following the crackdown on robbery, theft, and hooliganism in early April.

An official from the provincial public security bureau told the reporter that this unified action resulted in the arrest of 5,519 transient criminals across the province, 473 criminals involved in the trafficking of women and children, and 1,421 criminals involved in prostitution, solicitation, and the coercion of women into prostitution. Additionally, several transient criminal gangs were dismantled, and several major cases were solved.

In early April, while concentrating on cracking down on robbery, theft, and hooliganism, the Henan Provincial Public Security Bureau, Courts, Procuratorates, and Justice Department issued a joint notice based on the principle of combining punishment with education. They urged criminals to voluntarily surrender and take the path of leniency, reducing or exempting punishment for minor or accessory offenders based on the circumstances. Under the deterrent effect of severe crackdowns, the appeal of policies, and social pressure, over 6,000 criminals voluntarily surrendered, with scenes of wives sending husbands, brothers sending younger brothers, and parents sending sons to turn themselves in.

The concentrated actions against robbery, theft, hooliganism, and transient criminals have significantly improved social order in Henan Province. In April, the number of major robbery and theft cases in the province decreased by 10% and 9% respectively compared to March. In May, the incidence of these two types of cases further decreased significantly compared to the previous month.

　　河南打击流窜犯罪分子
    七千罪犯落网　六千多人自首
    本报郑州６月５日电  记者李杰报道：最近，为维护社会治安，保卫“三夏”，河南省公安机关组织了以打击流窜犯罪为重点的集中统一行动，一些罪恶累累的惯犯、要犯、久抓未获的流窜犯相继落网。这是河南省公安机关继４月初集中打击抢劫、盗窃、流氓犯罪活动之后，又一次集中统一的重大行动。
    省公安厅一位负责官员对记者说，这次统一行动，全省共抓获流窜犯罪分子５５１９人，拐卖妇女、儿童的犯罪分子４７３人，卖淫妇女、嫖客以及诱留、强迫妇女卖淫的犯罪分子１４２１人。同时，还摧毁了一批流窜犯罪团伙，破获了一些大案要案。
    今年４月初，在集中打击抢劫、盗窃、流氓犯罪分子的同时，河南省公安厅、法院、检察院、司法厅根据惩办与教育相结合的方针，发出联合通告，敦促犯罪分子主动投案自首，走坦白从宽的道路，视情节，对偶犯或从犯可以减轻处罚以至免除处罚。在严厉打击的威慑、政策的感召和社会舆论的压力下，６０００多犯罪分子纷纷投案自首，出现了妻送夫、兄送弟、父母送子投案的场面。
    集中打击抢劫、盗窃、流氓犯罪分子和流窜犯罪的行动，使河南省社会治安大大好转。４月份，全省重大抢劫、盗窃案件比３月份分别下降１０％和９％，５月份，两案的发案率又大大低于上月。
