The Chinese women's national basketball team lost to the Spanish team 77 to 98 in the third day of the French International Women's Basketball Tournament held tonight in Orleans. The Chinese team's offensive and defensive capabilities were weakened as their tall center, Zheng Haixia, did not play due to injury.

Tomorrow, the Soviet Union team will compete with the Spanish team for the championship, while the Chinese team will vie with the Canadian team for third place. The Chinese women's basketball team won their first match in the French International Women's Basketball Tournament held on the night of June 1 in Orleans, defeating the French team 82 to 75.
