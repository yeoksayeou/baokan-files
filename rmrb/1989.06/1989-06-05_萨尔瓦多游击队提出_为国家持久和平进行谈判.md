	Salvador Guerrillas Propose
	Negotiations for Lasting Peace in the Country
		Our reporter Guo Weicheng from Mexico City reports: Salvador guerrillas have launched a political offensive against the new government set to take office on June 1, demanding negotiations for the country's "lasting peace."

		According to Mexican news media reports, the "Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front" of Salvador guerrillas issued a statement on May 29, saying that the organization demands to negotiate with various political parties in Salvador while engaging in dialogue and negotiations with the new government. To contribute to the easing of tensions in the Central American region, the guerrillas are willing to reach a ceasefire agreement with the new government and create an atmosphere for dialogue and negotiations.

		Since the beginning of this year, Salvador guerrillas have twice proposed ending the 9-year-long civil war. At the end of January, the guerrillas suggested that if the originally scheduled March national elections were postponed for 6 months, they would be willing to create conditions to participate in national political life. However, the government rejected this proposal. At the end of February, the guerrillas proposed that if the government legally dealt with the reactionary military personnel involved in the collective massacre of the Salvadoran people, the guerrillas would be willing to stop hostile actions and reduce their military strength from the current 55,000 to the 12,000 at the start of the civil war in 1980. However, the government did not agree.

		This time, the guerrillas proposed that if the new Cristiani government agrees to legally punish Daubisson (the founder of the extreme right-wing Nationalist Republican Alliance) and other reactionary officers involved in the murder of Archbishop Romero; dissolve the extreme right-wing "death squads"; respect the 1980 land reform in economic terms, and restore state control over banks and foreign trade; then the guerrilla side will stop destroying the country's economy, including transportation and energy; stop hostile actions against new government members and U.S. facilities within Salvador, and create conditions to resume negotiations for "achieving lasting peace in the country."

　　萨尔瓦多游击队提出
    为国家持久和平进行谈判
    本报墨西哥城电  记者郭伟成报道：萨尔瓦多游击队向即将于６月１日执政的新政府发起政治攻势，要求就国家的“持久和平”进行谈判。
    据墨西哥新闻媒介报道，萨尔瓦多游击队“法拉本多·马蒂民族解放阵线”５月２９日发表公告说，该组织要求与萨尔瓦多各政党谈判的同时，与新政府进行对话与谈判。为了对中美洲地区缓和进程作出贡献，游击队愿意与新政府达成停火协议，创造对话与谈判的气氛。
    今年以来，萨尔瓦多游击队已经两次建议结束持续９年的内战。１月底，游击队曾提出，只要把原定３月份举行的全国大选推迟６个月进行，游击队愿意创造条件参与国家政治生活。但是政府拒绝了这一建议。２月底，游击队提出，如果政府依法处置参与对萨尔瓦多人民进行集体屠杀的反动军人，游击队愿意停止敌对行动，并把军事力量从目前的５５０００人减少到１９８０年内战开始的１２０００人。但是，政府没有同意。
    这次，游击队提出，只要克里斯蒂亚尼新政府同意依法惩办达乌布依松（极右翼民族主义共和联盟创始人）及其它参与杀害罗梅洛大主教的反动军官；解散极右派的“敢死队”；在经济方面尊重１９８０年的土改，恢复国家对银行与外贸的控制；则游击队方面将停止对国家经济，包括交通、能源的破坏行动；停止对新政府成员及萨尔瓦多境内美国设施的敌对行动，创造条件，重新进行“争取国家持久和平”的谈判。
