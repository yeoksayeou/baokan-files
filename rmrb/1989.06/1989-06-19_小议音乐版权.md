Title: A Brief Discussion on Music Copyright

The issue of copyright is a significant concern in the popular music industry. Young lyricists and composers like Cui Jian and Chen Zhe are eagerly awaiting the enactment of a copyright law by the state, while also taking action with entities like the Recording and Videotape Publishing House to protect their legal rights through existing legal procedures. In an industry where legal awareness is weak, one can imagine the difficulties they face in pursuing these legal battles.

Around 1984, numerous audio-visual companies were established, and despite several rounds of rectification, the practice of "ripping" (unauthorized copying) remains rampant. Since it is possible to freely compile popular tracks without paying royalties, there is little incentive to organize original creations. Since lyric and music composition is less profitable than arranging and producing, some lyricists and composers have had to abandon their artistic pursuits and join the ranks of "rippers." The crisis in creation stems from this.

The audio-visual industry's disregard for the legal rights of lyricists and composers is a form of plunder, a trampling of their legal rights. Some companies, upon receiving compensation letters from lyricists and composers, either ignore them or delay responses, or send a trivial amount of money as a mere formality. This goes beyond just a lack of legal awareness.

Cui Jian, Chen Zhe, and others believe that the copyright issue is not just about economic rights but also about human rights. The state constitution affirms the rights that citizens should enjoy, and every citizen has the right to exercise and defend these rights.

In an era of reform and opening up, it is inevitable that various problems will arise. However, this inevitability should not be an excuse for passive waiting, nor should outdated ethics be used to reform lawbreakers. Instead, we must strengthen legal construction, reform old systems, and effectively supervise and punish. If lyricists and composers do not have a clear sense of their rights, who will help change the status quo? Popular music has weathered many storms and crises, and the post-"Northwest Wind" period's crisis has clearly focused on the copyright issue. Although some have risen to call for action, most responses are moral support rather than concrete actions. This situation will stifle the enthusiasm of a batch of lyricists and composers, ruin a generation of singers, and the low-quality audio products produced from this situation will also pollute a generation of listeners.

Therefore, I believe that lyricists and composers should no longer be indifferent or complain without taking action. At the very least, they should take action based on existing relevant laws. A normal market mechanism cannot form spontaneously. If everyone endures in silence and goes with the flow, the future of popular music will be in jeopardy.

　　小议音乐版权
    金兆钧
    版权问题是流行音乐界关心的问题。崔健、陈哲等一些青年词曲作家一边期待国家早日颁行版权法，一边同录音录像出版总社等单位采取行动，力图通过现行的法律程序来保卫自身的合法权益。在法制观念淡漠的音像界中，可以想象，这些官司打起来该有多么困难。
    一九八四年左右，大批音像公司纷纷成立，虽然几经整顿，音像界“扒带子”之风仍然十分猖獗。既然可以把他人创作出版的走红曲目自由组合而不必付版税，便就无人肯去组织创作了。既然词曲创作不如配器组带，一些词曲作家只好放弃艺术，加入“扒虫”大军。创作之危机，实源于此。
    音像界漠视词曲作家合法权益，是一种巧取豪夺，是对他们合法权益的践踏。有些公司在接到词曲作家的索赔信函后，居然不理不睬，或故意拖延，或寄上一、二十元虚与委蛇。这就不仅仅是法制观念淡薄的问题了。
    崔健、陈哲等人认为：版权问题不仅是经济权益问题，也是人的权利问题。国家的宪法肯定了公民应享有的权利，每一个公民就有权利行使和保卫这些权利。
    处在改革、开放的时代，发生这种那种问题是难免的，但这种难免不应成为消极等待的借口，更不应用陈旧的伦理去感化违法者，而必须加强法制建设，改革旧体制，有效地进行监督和制裁。词曲作家倘若没有明确的权利观念，谁能帮助你改变现状呢？流行音乐在风风雨雨中几起几落，“西北风”后期的危机已经明显地集中到了版权问题上。虽有人起来奔走呼号，反应者多为道义声援，并未采取实际行动。这种状态会扼杀一批词曲作家积极性，毁掉一代歌星，由此状态中产生的低劣音响制品也足以污染一代听众。
    因此，我认为词曲作家不要再麻木不仁，不要再牢骚满腹而无所作为。至少要依据现行有关法律采取行动。正常的市场机制是不可能自发形成的。假如大家忍气吞声随波逐流，流行音乐的前途将岌岌可危。
