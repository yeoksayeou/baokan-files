South Africa Extends State of Emergency Again

	New York Times, Harare, June 9th - According to reports from South Africa, South African President P.W. Botha today announced the extension of the national state of emergency for another year, aiming to further suppress black resistance and opposition party activities.

	Botha stated that although political unrest had significantly decreased last year, some radical black elements were still seeking opportunities to overthrow the government. Therefore, the implementation of the state of emergency law would enable the government to effectively prevent large-scale riots instigated by radical elements.

	On June 12, 1986, South Africa first declared a national state of emergency. After two extensions, the national state of emergency was set to expire at midnight on June 11th. Thus, President Botha announced the third extension of the state of emergency.

　　南非再次延长全国紧急状态
    新华社哈博罗内６月９日电  据来自南非的消息，南非总统博塔今天宣布再次延长全国紧急状态一年，以期进一步镇压黑人斗争和反对党的活动。
    博塔说，尽管去年政治动乱明显减少，但是一些激进的黑人仍然伺机推翻政府。因此，紧急状态法的实施能使政府有效地制止由激进分子挑起的大规模暴动。
    １９８６年６月１２日，南非首次宣布全国处于紧急状态。经两次延长，全国紧急状态将在６月１１日午夜到期。为此，博塔总统又第三次宣布延长紧急状态。
