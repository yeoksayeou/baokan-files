Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 8th.

On the matter of the U.S. Embassy providing so-called "protection" to Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has lodged a serious protest.

On June 8th, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zhu Qizhen summoned U.S. Ambassador to China James Lilley to express the Ministry's strong objection. Vice Minister Zhu stated that according to our information, Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian have entered the U.S. Embassy in Beijing seeking so-called "protection." The U.S. Embassy has granted them refuge. On June 6th, White House spokesman Fitzwater confirmed this. This action is a violation of international law and also a violation of Chinese laws. It is well known that Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian have consistently opposed the socialist system and opposed the leadership of the Chinese government and the Communist Party of China. The U.S. Embassy's actions constitute a gross interference in China's internal affairs. We express deep regret and lodge a serious protest. We will closely monitor the development of the situation.

　　就美使馆给予方励之等所谓“保护”事
    我外交部提出严重抗议
    新华社北京６月８日电  中国外交部副部长朱启祯今天约见美国驻华大使李洁明，就美国驻华大使馆给予方励之和李淑娴所谓“保护”事，提出了严重抗议。
    朱副部长说，据我们获悉，方励之和李淑娴已进入美国驻华使馆寻求所谓“保护”。美国驻华使馆已给予庇护。本月６日白宫发言人菲茨沃特证实了此事。这一行动是违反国际法的，同时也是违反中国有关法律的。众所周知，方励之和李淑娴一贯反对社会主义制度，反对中国政府和中国共产党的领导，美国使馆的行动是对中国内政的粗暴干涉。对此，我们表示极大的遗憾并提出严重抗议，我们将密切注视事态的发展。
