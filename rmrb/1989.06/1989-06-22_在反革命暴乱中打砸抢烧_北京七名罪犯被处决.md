Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 22nd.

Following the execution order issued by the President of the Beijing Higher People's Court, Lin Zhaohong, Zhang Wenkuai, Chen Jian, Zu Jianjun, Wang Hanwu, Luo Hongjun, and Ban Huijie, seven criminals who were sentenced to death for arson, looting, and vandalism during the counter-revolutionary riot, were executed by firing squad this morning by the Intermediate People's Court of Beijing.

Lin Zhaohong and the other six criminals appealed their death sentences handed down by the Intermediate People's Court of Beijing on June 17th, claiming they did not accept the original verdict.

The Beijing Higher People's Court reviewed each of the seven appeals, listened to the appellants' reasons for appeal, self-defense, final statements, and the defense attorneys' arguments, and conducted a comprehensive review of the original verdict's facts, evidence, application of law, and the entire judicial procedure. The Beijing Higher People's Court ruled that the original verdict's determination of the appellants' crimes was clear, with sufficient and conclusive evidence. The appellants also admitted their crimes during the appeal process. Lin Zhaohong and the others committed serious crimes of arson, looting, and vandalism during the counter-revolutionary riot, which were extremely heinous and caused immense social harm. They must be severely punished by law. The original verdict's determination of guilt and sentencing was correct, and the judicial procedure was legal. Based on this, the Beijing Higher People's Court, after deliberation by the Judicial Committee, decided, in accordance with the relevant provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law, to dismiss the appeals and uphold the original verdict. According to the notice issued by the Supreme People's Court on September 7, 1983, authorizing higher people's courts to review and approve certain death penalty cases, the Beijing Higher People's Court approved the death sentences for Lin Zhaohong, Zhang Wenkuai, Chen Jian, Zu Jianjun, Wang Hanwu, Luo Hongjun, and Ban Huijie, and stripped them of their political rights for life.

　　在反革命暴乱中打砸抢烧     
    北京七名罪犯被处决
    新华社北京６月２２日电  遵照北京市高级人民法院院长下达的执行死刑的命令，林昭荣、张文奎、陈坚、祖建军、王汉武、罗红军、班会杰７名在反革命暴乱中打砸抢烧被判处死刑的罪犯，今天上午已被市中级人民法院押赴刑场执行枪决。
    林昭荣等７名罪犯，在６月１７日被市中级人民法院判处死刑后均不服原判，向市高级人民法院提出上诉。
    市高级人民法院对林昭荣放火案等７件上诉案，逐案进行了审理，听取了上诉人的上诉理由、自我辩护、最后陈述和辩护人的辩护意见，对原判认定的事实、证据、适用法律以及整个审判程序进行了全面审查。市高级人民法院认为：原审判决认定各上诉人的罪行，事实清楚，证据充分、确实、足以认定。上诉人在上诉审理中也供认不讳。林昭荣等在反革命暴乱中，打、砸、抢、烧，罪行特别严重，性质极为恶劣，社会危害极大，必须依法严惩。原判定罪量刑正确，审判程序合法。据此，北京市高级人民法院经审判委员会讨论决定，依照刑事诉讼法的有关规定，裁定驳回上诉，维持原判；并根据最高人民法院１９８３年９月７日依法授权高级人民法院核准部分死刑案件通知的规定，核准林昭荣、张文奎、陈坚、祖建军、王汉武、罗红军、班会杰死刑，剥夺政治权利终身。
