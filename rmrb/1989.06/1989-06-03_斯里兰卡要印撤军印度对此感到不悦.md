Xinhua News Agency, New Delhi, June 2nd.

India's Ministry of Foreign Affairs spokesman stated today that India is "baffled" by Sri Lankan President Premadasa's recent announcement that all Indian troops must withdraw from Sri Lanka by the end of July this year.

Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi had previously stated on April 24th that India must consider the issue of withdrawing troops from Sri Lanka as soon as possible, but that "withdrawal must be based on ensuring the achievements made in Sri Lanka."

The spokesman stated that the withdrawal date is not determined by the calendar but by the situation on the ground and can only be decided after consultations with the Sri Lankan government.

After India and Sri Lanka signed an agreement in July 1987, Indian troops entered Sri Lanka. The agreement required Indian troops to disarm the Tamil armed forces in the northeastern part of Sri Lanka and maintain peace in the region.

Recently, the main armed force of the Tamil people, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam, has begun negotiations with the government to achieve domestic peace. In this context, Sri Lankan leaders have demanded that Indian troops withdraw by the end of July.

    斯里兰卡要印撤军印度对此感到不悦
    新华社新德里6月2日电  印度外交部发言人今天说，印度对斯里兰卡总统普雷马达萨最近就所有印度军队必须在今年7月底前撤出斯里兰卡的宣布感到“迷惑不解”。
    印度总理拉·甘地曾在4月24日说，印度不得不考虑尽快从斯里兰卡撤军问题，但是，“撤军必须以保证其在斯里兰卡所获得的成果为前提”。
    发言人说，撤军日期不是看日历而是以局势为基础，通过与斯政府商量后才能决定。
    印度与斯里兰卡于1987年7月签署协议后，印军进驻斯里兰卡。协议要求印军解除斯东北部的泰米尔人的武装并维持这一地区的和平。
    最近，泰米尔人主要的武装力量泰米尔伊拉姆猛虎解放组织已开始同政府举行谈判，以求实现国内和平。在这种情况下，斯里兰卡领导人要求印军在7月底前撤出。
