On the morning of June 21, an elderly man with white hair, over fifty years old, came to a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison. He specifically asked for soldiers Li Cuinong, Kong Xianjin, and Zuo Congyuan. When the three soldiers ran to his presence and were about to salute, he had already raised his hand to the brim of his cap, facing the three young soldiers for a long time without lowering his hand, then tightly embraced the three soldiers...

This pure and intense emotion was so strong, only he himself, Zhang Huilin, the deputy director of the Dongcheng District Public Security Bureau of Beijing, could feel it most deeply...

At 3 a.m. on June 3, in the office of Deputy Director Zhang Huilin of the Dongcheng District Public Security Bureau.

"Ring, ring, ring..." The phone rang urgently. The old director quickly picked up the receiver.

"I am Su Zhongxiang. Please dispatch personnel to Chang'an Street immediately to investigate the situation of rioters setting up roadblocks and burning military vehicles." The voice of Beijing's Deputy Mayor and Director of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, Su Zhongxiang, came through the phone.

In less than 5 minutes, a white sedan sped out of the Dongcheng District Public Security Bureau compound. Inside the car were Deputy Director Zhang Huilin and three public security officers. Deputy Director Zhang looked at his watch, the hands pointing to 5:50 a.m.

They drove to Chang'an Street, where they saw the neatly arranged street barriers and concrete separators had been torn down and scattered in piles. The old director observed from the car and reported the situation to his superiors via walkie-talkie.

At 6:10 a.m., when their car reached the vicinity of Nanchizi, a group of rioters who were inciting the crowd to set up roadblocks spotted them. Shouting, "Stop it! Stop it!" they led about two thousand unaware onlookers to surround the car.

At this moment, a rioter suddenly recognized the deputy director in the car and shouted to the crowd, "These people are from the Public Security Bureau, the old man is the deputy director, catch them and take them to the High Self-Autonomy Federation!" As soon as the words were out, more than ten rioters rushed forward, tearing at the clothes of the old director and the three public security officers. Seeing the situation deteriorate, the three young officers quickly pushed the old director into the car and used their bodies to protect the car door. The rioters threw bricks, concrete blocks, and bottles like rain, injuring all three. The situation was extremely dangerous. The old director immediately reported the emergency to the Beijing Public Security Bureau. At this moment, a group of rioters discovered the walkie-talkie in the car and rushed to grab it.

Just as a few rioters grabbed the walkie-talkie, a female rioter ran to Tiananmen Square and brought back a few leaders of the High Self-Autonomy Federation, who shouted viciously, "Push the old man to the square as a hostage!" and began pushing the car. At this time, three soldiers from a certain unit of the Beijing Garrison, Li Cuinong, Kong Xianjin, and Zuo Congyuan, who were on duty in civilian clothes, arrived at the scene. Hearing the shouts, they realized that there must be a leader inside the car and quickly pushed through the crowd to the front of the car. A rioter saw them and pushed soldier Li Cuinong hard, "Who are you from?" "We are students from ×× University!" the three soldiers replied cleverly. The rioter, hearing this, did not attack. The three soldiers stood guard at both sides of the car doors, and the three officers tightly guarded the car. To avoid revealing their identities and to reassure the old director inside the car, soldier Li Cuinong shook hands with the old director, and Kong Xianjin and Zuo Congyuan pointed to their short hair to signal their presence.

The car was pushed to the west gate of the History Museum amidst the shouts of a group of rioters. Along the way, dozens of rioters threw stones at the old director inside the car, but all were blocked by the three soldiers. A group of rioters noticed something was wrong and pushed the three soldiers in civilian clothes away, opened the car door, and dragged the old director out. The situation was extremely critical! The three soldiers rushed forward and snatched the old director from the rioters, running towards the Tiananmen Police Station...

Along the way, soldiers Li Cuinong and Zuo Congyuan supported the old director, while soldier Kong Xianjin protected from the rear. The three public security officers, seeing that they were their own people, disregarded the pain from their injuries inflicted by the rioters and bravely led the way. When they approached Jin Shui Bridge, a one-meter-high iron railing blocked their path. The rioters were closely pursuing them, and stones and bricks were constantly thrown at them. What to do? "Charge through!" Soldiers Li Cuinong and Zuo Congyuan supported the old director and jumped over. Soldier Zuo Congyuan's left leg was cut by the iron railing, leaving three one-inch-long wounds, and Li Cuinong's shoe was kicked off, with several wounds on his sole, causing intense pain. But they had only one thought in mind: they must ensure the safety of the old director!

When the three soldiers brought the old director to Jin Shui Bridge, a group of rioters blocked their way, and fists rained down on them. The three soldiers tightly protected the old director in the middle, working together with the three public security officers, finally breaking through the rioters' blockade, crossing Jin Shui Bridge, and safely escorting the old director to the Tiananmen Police Station.

The old director was safely rescued, but the three soldiers who risked their lives to save him quietly left. "No matter what, we must find these three good soldiers!" said the relevant leaders of the Beijing Public Security Bureau, deeply moved.

After seven or eight days of investigation, they finally found the three soldiers in a certain regiment of the Beijing Garrison. The unit leaders only then learned that the three soldiers had not told anyone about this heroic rescue.

　　战士智救老局长
    张响贤　于保月
    ６月２１日上午，一位年过半百、头发花白的“老公安”来到北京卫戍区某部，点名要找该部战士李促农、孔宪金、左从元。当三位战士跑步来到“老公安”面前正准备敬礼时，他早已把手举到了警帽沿下，面对着三位年轻的战士久久地不肯把手放下，继而把三个战士紧紧地搂在一起……
    这纯真、炽热的情感为何这样强烈？只有他——北京市公安局东城分局副局长张惠林自己感受最深……
    ６月３日凌晨，东城公安分局副局长张惠林办公室。
    “叮呤呤……”，一阵急促的电话铃声，老局长急忙拿起话筒。
    “我是苏仲祥，请你们马上派人到长安街了解一下暴徒设置路障和烧毁军车的情况。”电话里传来北京市副市长兼北京市公安局长苏仲祥的声音。
    不到５分钟，一辆乳白色小轿车从东城公安分局大院迅速驶了出来。车上，坐着副局长张惠林和三名公安干警。张副局长抬起手腕看了看手表，指针指向凌晨５时５０分。
    他们乘车来到长安街，只见原来非常整齐的街心栏杆和水泥隔离墩，早已被拆得东一堆西一堆。老局长在车上边看边用对讲机向上级汇报。
    ６时１０分，当他们乘坐的小车来到南池子附近时，正在这里煽动群众设路障的一伙暴徒见状，边喊：“截住它！截住它！”边带领一些不明真相的群众达两千人把车团团围住。
    这时，一个暴徒突然认出了车上的副局长，便向人群高声喊叫起来：“这些人是公安局的，老头就是副局长，抓住他们，绑到高自联去！”话音一落，十多个暴徒冲了上来，开始撕拉老局长和三个公安干警的衣服。三个青年干警一看情况不好，急忙把老局长推到车上，用身体护住车门。暴徒们的砖块、水泥块、瓶子雨点般地扔了过来，三个人都受了伤，情况相当危急。老局长连忙向市公安局紧急报告。此刻，一伙暴徒发现车上有对讲机，一拥而上把对讲机抢走了。
    几个暴徒刚抢走对话机，一个女暴徒跑到天安门广场领来了几个“高自联”的头头，穷凶极恶喊道：“把老家伙推到广场去作人质！”并动手推车。这时，正在执行任务的北京卫戍区某部三名战士李促农、孔宪金、左从元，身着便衣来到此地。听到喊声，意识到车内肯定是一位领导干部，连忙拨开人群挤到车前。一个暴徒见状，上前猛推战士李促农一把：“你们是哪里的？”“××大学学生！”三个战士机智地回答。暴徒一听便没动手。三个战士分别守在两边的车门旁，三名干警也紧紧地把守在车旁。为了不暴露身份，并让车内的老局长放心，战士李促农握了握车内老局长的手，孔宪金、左从元指了指自己的寸发，进行联络。
    车在一伙暴徒的呼叫声中被推到历史博物馆西门，沿途几十个暴徒用石块砸车内的老局长，都被三名战士用身体挡住。一伙暴徒发觉情况不对头，拥上来把三个便衣战士推开，拉开车门，把老局长拖了下来。情况万分危急！三个战士一齐冲上去从暴徒手中抢过老局长，便向天安门派出所方向跑去……
    一路上，战士李促农、左从元架着老局长，战士孔宪金在后防护，三名公安干警见是自己人，不顾早已被暴徒打伤的疼痛，奋力在前边开路。在接近金水桥时，一道一米多高的铁栏杆挡住了去路，后面暴徒在紧紧地追赶着，石块、砖头不时地向他们打来。怎么办？“冲过去！”战士李促农、左从元架着老局长跨了过去。战士左从元的左腿被铁栏杆划破了三条一寸多长的血口，李促农的鞋子被踩掉，脚底被扎开了好几处血口子，疼痛钻心，但他们心中只有一个念头：一定要保住老局长的安全！
    当三个战士架着老局长来到金水桥时，一伙暴徒挡住了去路，拳头雨点般的朝他们打来，三人紧紧地把老局长保护在中间，与三位公安干警通力合作，终于冲出了暴徒的拦阻，冲过了金水桥，将老局长安全地护送到了天安门派出所。
    老局长安全脱险了，可在危急关头冒险抢救他们的三个战士却悄悄离去了。“无论如何，一定要找到这三个好战士！”北京市公安局等有关领导得知这一情况后，感动地说。
    经过七八天查询，他们终于在北京卫戍区某团找到了这三名战士。部队领导此时也才知道，原来这三个战士一直没向人讲过这件英勇救人的事迹。
