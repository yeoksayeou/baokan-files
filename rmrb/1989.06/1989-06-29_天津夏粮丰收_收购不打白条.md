		Tianjin has achieved a bumper summer grain harvest this year. The total production of wheat from 206,000 hectares across the city is expected to exceed 560 million kilograms, setting a new historical high. Thanks to the timely allocation of procurement funds, there is no need to issue "white receipts" for the procurement process. The city's procurement task of 12.5 million kilograms of summer grain is about to be completed.

		Since last winter, under the guidance of the policy to "stabilize the area, focus on increasing yield per unit, and increase total production," Tianjin has allocated 15 million yuan of special funds for grain production entirely to grain production. At the same time, the city has carried out extensive agricultural infrastructure construction to improve production conditions; further established and improved the wheat seed breeding system; actively promoted advanced scientific and technological practices, and implemented a responsibility system for leading cadres to "take charge of" specific areas and counties, strengthening management, and laying a solid foundation for the bumper wheat harvest.

		To ensure that no "white receipts" are issued during the procurement process, relevant departments have taken various measures to gain the trust of the people.

　　天津夏粮丰收　收购不打白条
    本报天津６月２９日电  记者梁小琴报道：今年，天津夏粮又获丰收，全市２０６万亩小麦总产将超过５．６亿公斤，创历史最高水平。由于提前落实收购资金，收购不用打“白条”，全市１２５０万公斤夏粮定购任务即将完成。
    去冬以来，在“稳定面积、主攻单产、增加总产”的方针指导下，天津市将１５００万元粮食生产专用基金完全用于粮食生产。同时，大搞农田基本建设，改善生产条件；进一步建立健全小麦良种繁育体系；积极推出先进的科学技术，实行领导干部“包片”、“包乡”责任制，加强管理，为小麦丰收打下了良好基础。
    为了确保收购中不出现“打白条”现象，有关部门采取各种措施，取信于民。
