Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 24th.

The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Foreign Affairs Committee has been holding full meetings over the past few days to study Deng Xiaoping's important speech during his reception of senior military officers from the capital's martial law troops. They believe that this speech is a very important historical document and that we should use it to unify our thoughts and guide our work.

The committee members expressed their high respect for the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the public security officers who made significant contributions in suppressing this counter-revolutionary rebellion. They pointed out that the essence of this counter-revolutionary rebellion was to overthrow the Communist Party of China, overthrow the socialist system, and subvert the People's Republic. At this critical moment, when the fate of the country and the nation is at stake, the Chinese People's Liberation Army firmly executed the decisions of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission. They bravely shouldered the sacred mission of "defending the motherland and protecting the peaceful labor of the people" as stipulated by the Constitution, and at a great cost, achieved a major victory in suppressing this counter-revolutionary rebellion. They are truly the people's army and the staunch defenders of the Constitution of the People's Republic of China. Their achievements will be recorded in the glorious annals of the socialist People's Republic of China.

When discussing the international community's response to the Chinese government's suppression of this counter-revolutionary rebellion, the committee members pointed out that many governments and parliaments, as well as people from various circles, have expressed understanding, sympathy, and support for the Chinese government and people in suppressing this counter-revolutionary rebellion. We appreciate this and cherish their friendship towards the Chinese people. At the same time, we have also noticed that some people abroad have, without knowing the facts, said some things that hurt the feelings of the Chinese people. We believe that as they continue to learn about the situation in China, they will understand the measures taken by the Chinese government to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion. China's door to friendship with all countries is always open.

The committee members said that suppressing the rebellion and opposing subversion are purely matters of Chinese sovereignty and internal affairs, and no country has the right to interfere. However, we must point out that a few people and some countries, when there was turmoil and rebellion in China's capital, ignored the facts, spread rumors, and incited trouble. They even used various means to support the counter-revolutionary rebellion. After we suppressed the counter-revolutionary rebellion, they shouted about imposing various sanctions on China and putting pressure on China. This is a gross interference in China's internal affairs and a blatant violation of the principles of mutual relations among countries in the international community. We advise these gentlemen not to forget: the Chinese people, who have stood up, will never do anything that harms friendly relations with other countries, and will never yield to any external pressure. This was true in the past, is true now, and will be true in the future.

The committee members unanimously agreed that Deng Xiaoping's speech clearly pointed out that the line, principles, and policies formulated since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee are correct. The "one center, two basic points" are correct. Our basic propositions, from the development strategy to the principles and policies, including reform and opening up, are all correct. If there is anything lacking, it is that reform and opening up have not gone far enough. They also pointed out that the most important thing is not to turn China into a closed country. The committee members believe that these very important judgments made by Comrade Xiaoping are correct conclusions drawn from practice. Our country will continue, as it has always done, to adhere to an independent and peaceful foreign policy and an open policy to the outside world. We will continue to develop friendly and cooperative relations with various countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence. After thoroughly suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, China's steps in reform and opening up will be more stable, better, and even faster. China's friendly and cooperative relations with various countries will be further consolidated and developed.

　　人大外事委员会学习邓小平讲话时强调    
    中国对外友好大门是敞开的   
    奉劝国外极少数人不要粗暴干涉我内政
    据新华社北京６月２４日电  据全国人大有关部门提供的消息：全国人大外事委员会连日来召开全体会议，学习邓小平同志在接见首都戒严部队军以上干部时的重要讲话，认为这个讲话是十分重要的历史性文件，要用它来统一我们的思想，指导我们的各项工作。
    委员们对在平息这场反革命暴乱中立下丰功伟绩的中国人民解放军、武警官兵和公安干警表示崇高的敬意。他们指出，这场反革命暴乱的实质是要打倒中国共产党，推翻社会主义制度，颠覆人民共和国。在关系到国家和民族前途命运的关键时刻，中国人民解放军坚定地执行党中央、国务院、中央军委的决策，勇敢地肩负起宪法所赋予的“保卫祖国，保卫人民的和平劳动”的神圣使命，以巨大的代价取得了平息这场反革命暴乱的重大胜利。他们不愧为人民的子弟兵，不愧为人民共和国宪法的坚强捍卫者。他们的功绩将载入社会主义的中华人民共和国的光荣史册。
    委员们在谈到国际社会对我国政府平息这场反革命暴乱的反应时指出，许多国家的政府和议会以及各界有识之士对中国政府和中国人民平息这场反革命暴乱表示理解、同情和支持。对此，我们表示赞赏，并珍视他们对中国人民的友好情谊。同时，也注意到国外有些人在不明事实真相的情况下说了一些伤害中国人民感情的话。我们相信，他们随着对中国情况的不断了解，是会理解中国政府对反革命暴乱所采取的措施的。中国对世界各国友好的大门任何时候都是敞开的。
    委员们谈到，平息暴乱，反对颠覆，这本来完全是中国主权范围内的事情，纯粹是中国的内政，任何国家都无权干涉。但我们不能不指出，国外有极少数人和个别国家在中国首都发生动乱和暴乱时，不顾事实，编造谣言，煽风点火，甚至用各种手段支持反革命暴乱，在我们平息反革命暴乱后，他们又叫嚷要对中国实行这样那样的制裁，对中国施加压力；这是对中国内政的粗暴干涉，是对国际社会各国相互关系准则的肆意践踏。我们奉劝这些先生不要忘记：已经站起来了的中国人民永远不做有损于与各国友好关系的事，也永远不会屈服于任何外来的压力。过去如此，现在如此，将来也是如此。
    委员们一致认为，邓小平同志的讲话明确指出，党的十一届三中全会以来制订的路线、方针、政策是正确的。“一个中心、两个基本点”是正确的。我们的一些基本提法，从发展战略到方针政策，包括改革开放，都是对的。要说不够，就是改革开放得还不够。还指出，重要的是，切不要把中国搞成一个关闭的国家。委员们认为，小平同志这些非常重要的论断，是从实践中得出的正确结论。我们国家将一如既往，坚持奉行独立自主的和平外交政策和对外开放政策，继续在和平共处五项原则的基础上发展同各国的友好合作关系。在彻底平息反革命暴乱之后，中国改革开放的步伐将会迈得更稳、更好，甚至更快，中国同各国的友好合作关系将会得到进一步巩固和发展。
