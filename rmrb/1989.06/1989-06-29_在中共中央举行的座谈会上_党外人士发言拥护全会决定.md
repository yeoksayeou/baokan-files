On June 28th in the afternoon, a meeting was held by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China (CPC) with non-Communist Party members. Leaders from the central committees of various democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, non-partisan individuals, and representatives from minority ethnic groups all spoke. They expressed their enthusiastic support for the decisions made at the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee. They stated that they would organize their members to thoroughly study the relevant documents of the Fourth Plenary Session, earnestly implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session, and assist the Party and the government in addressing the four major tasks proposed by the plenary session.

Jurong Zhu (Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang) said: Shortly after the conclusion of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee, the new leadership of the CPC, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, met with us. This vividly demonstrates the genuine cooperation and close relationship between the Communist Party of China and various democratic parties. I fully agree with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's wise judgment that "the nature of this incident is the opposition between bourgeois liberalization and the four cardinal principles." The members of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang deeply feel that the four cardinal principles are the foundation of the state. Without the Communist Party, there would be no New China. Only socialism can save China. Those who promote bourgeois liberalization attempt to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and subvert the socialist People's Republic. Such a historical regression is absolutely unacceptable. In this incident, some counter-revolutionary conspirators attempted to drive a wedge between the democratic parties and the Communist Party, turning the democratic parties into opposition parties. This is a futile attempt. The Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang has weathered storms and shared hardships with the Communist Party for decades, forging a close friendship.

Without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang today; only by following the socialist path can the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang have a future. This is a conclusion drawn from history. We must firmly uphold the four cardinal principles, oppose bourgeois liberalization, and steadfastly maintain political and practical unity with the Communist Party.

Feixiang Fei (Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League) said: After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the urgent task is to stabilize public sentiment and boost morale. We hope to strictly distinguish and correctly handle the two different types of contradictions, adopt a protective attitude towards the majority of students, and focus on education to prevent the expansion of mistakes. Members of the China Democratic League are mostly engaged in educational work and should help with this aspect. We hope that effective measures will be taken promptly to address several major issues of concern to the people, especially the punishment of corrupt officials and the promotion of clean governance, to give the people a fresh impression. The China Democratic League has always believed that upholding the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist path is the fundamental principle for improving multi-party cooperation. As a political party mainly composed of middle and upper-level intellectuals in the fields of education, science, and technology, the China Democratic League will continue to assist the CPC in implementing the policy towards intellectuals, uniting them around the Party, and making further contributions to the progress and development of the Chinese nation.

Qimeng Sun (Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Association for Promoting Democracy) said: The significant political and organizational achievements of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee will undoubtedly have a profound and far-reaching impact on further suppressing the rebellion, stabilizing the situation, and continuing to promote China's socialist modernization and reform and opening-up. The members of the China Association for Promoting Democracy fully agree with the view that upholding the four cardinal principles and reform and opening-up are indispensable and cannot be separated. Only in this way can we correctly and completely understand and implement the general line and general policy of building socialism with Chinese characteristics. The construction of socialist material civilization and socialist spiritual civilization must indeed be pursued together, and in the entire process of reform and construction, neither should be hard while the other is soft, nor should one be prioritized over the other. We highly approve of earnestly implementing the spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech, on the one hand, to thoroughly suppress the rebellion, and on the other hand, while rectifying past mistakes, to improve reform and opening-up and various construction works. The China Association for Promoting Democracy is willing, in the spirit of sharing weal and woe with the Communist Party, to contribute to the realization of the tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session.

Jieqiong Lei (Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association) said: The Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee has a profound impact on stabilizing the national situation, unifying national thought, and strengthening unity. We firmly support the major decisions of the plenary session and the new leadership of the Party Central Committee. The basic line of "one center, two basic points" reaffirmed by the plenary session must be unswervingly implemented in the work of the China Democratic National Construction Association. Comrade Jiang Zemin, the General Secretary, said that we should continue to attach importance to the cause of science and education. I believe that under the leadership of Comrade Jiang Zemin and the new Party Central Committee, China's science and education will definitely achieve greater development. At this moment when the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion has achieved decisive victory, we support the spirit of strictly implementing policies and procedures and stabilizing the national situation. The China Democratic National Construction Association will closely unite around the CPC Central Committee and strive to accomplish the various tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session.

Fengxin Fang, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, spoke on behalf of Lu Qishi (Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association), saying: From our decades of personal experience, we deeply feel that without the leadership of the Communist Party, China's affairs cannot be well managed. The four cardinal principles are the foundation of the state and also the foundation of our China Democratic National Construction Association. In the future, we must continue to steadfastly adhere to them. Under the leadership of Comrade Jiang Zemin, the General Secretary of the CPC Central Committee, we must walk the path of reform and opening-up to strengthen the country. We firmly believe that the Communist Party of China will certainly successfully complete the four major tasks and will certainly strictly distinguish between the two different types of contradictions, making every effort to expand the scope of unity. We demand that all levels of the China Democratic National Construction Association and all party members strengthen ideological and political work, carry out patriotic and hard-working education, carry out education on upholding the four cardinal principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, and work in unity with the Communist Party of China to contribute greater efforts to the socialist cause of our country.

Yincheng Dong (Member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party) said: The members of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party unanimously believe that the convening of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee is a very important meeting in the history of the Communist Party of China, proving that the Communist Party is indeed the core leadership of all ethnic groups in the country. As a close friend of the CPC, the China Zhi Gong Party will, as always, closely unite around the CPC Central Committee, connect with overseas Chinese, compatriots, and relatives, continue to uphold the four cardinal principles, and steadfastly follow the path of reform and opening-up to strengthen the country. We will, through all channels and means, do a good job of explaining to overseas communities, helping them understand the domestic situation, and believing that China will continue to adhere to the policy of reform and opening-up.

Chengpei Sun, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party, spoke on behalf of Peiyuan Zhou (Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party), saying: The convening of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee, which is a symbol of unity and victory, so soon after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, fully proves that the leadership of the Communist Party of China is strong and resolute. Currently, after the suppression of the rebellion, it is still necessary to investigate and expose the political conspiracies behind the rebellion and not to stop halfway. At the same time, it is necessary to strictly distinguish between the two different types of contradictions and unite the majority. We must seize the time to make up for the losses in economic construction, focus on rectification and deepening reform, and promote sustained economic development. This struggle makes us deeply feel that ideological and political work is indeed very important. In the future, we will strengthen ideological education, oppose bourgeois liberalization, and will definitely be able to carry out and achieve results smoothly. After experiencing the recent storm, the China Zhi Gong Party is even more determined to accept the leadership of the Communist Party and will definitely make due contributions to the implementation of the various tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenamey Session of the 13th CPC Central Committee.

Zimin Cai (Member of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League) said: The members of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League believe that without stability, there can be no construction and no work towards national reunification; without upholding the four cardinal principles, the country will change color and become a satellite of another country; without reform and opening-up, we have no way out and will return to the old path of closure and backwardness. In this turmoil, the Kuomintang authorities in Taiwan misjudged the situation on the mainland and stirred up an anti-communist wave both inside and outside the island. Members of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League have extensive connections with compatriots inside and outside the island. We should, through various channels, do a good job of dispelling doubts and resolving misunderstandings for compatriots inside and outside the island, help them understand the new situation on the mainland after the Fourth Plenary Session, eliminate various doubts, promote exchanges across the Taiwan Strait, and contribute to the prosperity, strength, and peaceful reunification of the motherland.

Siyuan Cheng (Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, non-partisan individual) said: For a long time, the Party has established a close relationship of sharing weal and woe with democratic parties and non-partisan individuals. Since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th CPC Central Committee, this relationship has developed rapidly. We hope that the new Party Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, will continue to carry forward our political advantages, improve the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Party and the system of political consultation, mobilize all positive factors, and unite all possible forces to promote the cause of socialist modernization in China.

Yiren Rong (Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce) said: The broad masses of industrial and commercial enterprises are determined, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, to contribute to the completion of the tasks of stabilizing the economy, rectification, and deepening reform. I propose several suggestions regarding economic construction work: First, fully leverage the role of people's organizations and private channels to better promote the "one center, two basic points" basic line of our country to the outside world, promote mutual understanding between our country and other countries, and establish friendly cooperative relations. Second, resolutely overcome bureaucratism, prevent red tape, and facilitate the deepening of reform and opening-up. Effective measures should be taken to eliminate bad practices and punish corruption, and to promote and accelerate the opening-up to the outside world. Third, to do a good job in economic work, it is necessary to strictly separate administrative power from management power to promote economic development, attract foreign investment, and promote opening-up to the outside world.

Abao Jinmei (Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, ethnic minority representative) said: I firmly believe that the new Central Committee, with Comrade Jiang Zemin as the core, will certainly be able to lead the entire Party, the entire military, and the people of all ethnic groups in China to achieve new and greater successes in upholding the four cardinal principles, adhering to reform and opening-up, opposing bourgeois liberalization, and building socialist modernization. The older generation of revolutionaries, represented by Comrade Xiaoping, have a keen insight into the situation, far-sighted vision, and revolutionary courage. At a critical moment, they saved the Party and the Republic. I express my highest respect to the older generation of revolutionaries represented by Comrade Xiaoping.

We are facing the issue of how to enhance the confidence of all the people and the cohesion of the Party and the government. There must be decisive measures to rectify the mistakes in the work of the Party and the government, resolutely combat and punish various corrupt phenomena within the Party, and solve the problems that the people are not satisfied with.

The national issue concerns the long-term stability and prosperity of the country. I am deeply aware that the Party has always advocated and promoted the equality of all ethnic groups, but there are still many problems in specific work. The Fifth National People's Congress passed the Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy, and 5 years have passed. This autonomy law, which is deeply welcomed by the people of ethnic minorities, still has many problems in its implementation. I hope that the Party Central Committee and the State Council will pay attention to solving these problems.

　　在中共中央举行的座谈会上    
    党外人士发言拥护全会决定
    新华社北京６月２９日电  ６月２８日下午，在中共中央举行的党外人士座谈会上，各民主党派中央、全国工商联领导人，无党派人士和少数民族代表都发了言。大家表示，热烈拥护中共十三届四中全会所作出的各项决定，将组织成员深入学习四中全会有关文件，认真贯彻四中全会精神，协助党和政府为抓好全会提出的四件大事贡献力量。
    朱学范（全国人大常委会副委员长、民革中央主席）说：在中共十三届四中全会闭幕不久，以江泽民同志为核心的中共中央领导同志就同我们见面，生动地体现了中国共产党同各民主党派真诚合作、肝胆相照的关系。我非常赞同小平同志“这次事件的性质，就是资产阶级自由化和四项基本原则的对立”的英明论断。民革的同志深深体会到，四项基本原则是立国之本，没有共产党就没有新中国，只有社会主义能够救中国。那些搞资产阶级自由化的人，妄图推翻共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义的人民共和国，这样的历史大倒退是绝不容许出现的。在这次事件中，一些反革命阴谋分子，企图离间民主党派和共产党的关系，使民主党派变成反对党，这是妄想。民革同共产党风雨同舟、患难与共几十年，结成了亲密的友谊。
    没有共产党领导，就没有民革的今天；只有走社会主义道路，民革才有前途。这是历史得出的结论。我们要旗帜鲜明地坚持四项基本原则，反对资产阶级自由化，坚定不移地在政治上行动上同共产党保持一致。
    费孝通（全国人大常委会副委员长、民盟中央主席）说：在平息反革命暴乱之后，当务之急是安定人心，振奋人心。我们希望严格区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，对广大学生采取爱护的态度，对他们的过失以教育为主，防止扩大化。民盟成员多数从事教育工作，要帮助做好这方面的工作。我们希望尽快采取有力措施做几件人民普遍关心的大事，特别是惩治官倒和廉政建设，使全国人民耳目一新。民盟一贯认为，坚持中国共产党的领导，坚持社会主义道路是完善多党合作的根本原则。作为以文教科技界中上层知识分子为主的政党，民盟要一如既往地协助中共贯彻知识分子政策，把他们团结在党的周围，为中华民族的进步和发展作出进一步的贡献。
    孙起孟（全国人大常委会副委员长、民建中央主席）说：这次中共十三届四中全会所取得的政治上和组织上的重大成果，对于进一步平息暴乱、稳定局势，对于继续推进我国社会主义现代化建设和改革开放事业，一定会产生巨大而深远的影响。民建同志完全同意这样的观点：坚持四项基本原则和坚持改革开放缺一不可，不容割裂。这样才是正确地完整地认识和贯彻建设有中国特色的社会主义的总路线、总方针。社会主义物质文明建设和社会主义精神文明建设确确实实必须一起抓，在改革和建设的全部过程中，都不应一硬一软，也不应一先一后。我们十分赞同认真贯彻邓小平同志重要讲话的精神，一方面抓彻底平息暴乱，一方面在清理改正过去失误的同时，把改革开放和各项建设工作搞得更好。民建愿意本着同共产党风雨同舟、荣辱与共的精神，为实现四中全会提出的任务，发挥民建的应有作用。
    雷洁琼（全国人大常委会副委员长、民进中央主席）说：中共十三届四中全会对稳定全国局势，统一全国人民思想，加强团结，具有深远影响。我们坚决拥护全会的重大决定和调整后的党中央新的领导核心。全会重申的“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线，必须毫不动摇，我们要坚定不移地贯彻到民进的各项工作中去。江泽民总书记讲，要继续重视科技和教育事业，我相信，在江泽民同志为核心的党中央领导下，我国的科教事业必将有更大的发展。在平息反革命暴乱取得决定性胜利的时刻，我们赞同必须严格执行政策，严格依法办事的精神，进一步稳定全国局势。民进将紧密团结在中共中央周围，为实现四中全会提出的各项任务而奋斗。
    农工党中央常务副主席方荣欣代表卢嘉锡（全国政协副主席、农工党中央主席）发言说：我们从几十年的切身经历深深体会到，没有共产党的领导，中国的事情就办不好。四项基本原则是立国之本，也是我们农工民主党的立党之本，今后要毫不动摇地继续坚持。要在以江泽民为总书记的中共中央带领下，走好改革开放的强国之路。我们坚信，中国共产党一定能出色地完成四件大事，一定会严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，尽力扩大团结面。我们要求农工党各级组织和全体党员，加强思想政治工作，开展爱国主义、艰苦奋斗教育，开展坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的教育，与中国共产党同心同德，为我国的社会主义事业贡献更大力量。
    董寅初（全国人大常委会委员、致公党中央主席）说：致公党中央的同志一致认为，这次中共十三届四中全会的召开是中国共产党发展史上一次非常重要的会议，证明共产党不愧为全国各族人民的领导核心。作为中共的诤友，致公党将一如既往，紧密团结在中共中央周围，联系归侨、侨眷和海外亲友，继续坚持立国之本的四项基本原则，坚定不移地走改革开放这一强国之路。我们将通过一切途径和方式做好对海外的解释工作，使各界人士了解国内的政局，坚信我国将继续坚持改革开放的国策。
    九三学社中央常务副主席孙承佩代表周培源（全国政协副主席、九三学社中央主席）发言说：中共在平息反革命暴乱后这么短时间内就召开了标志着团结和胜利的十三届四中全会，这充分证明了中国共产党的领导是坚强有力的。当前，平息暴乱后还必须清查和揭露制造暴乱的政治阴谋，绝不能半途而废。同时要严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，团结大多数。我们要抓紧时间挽回经济建设中的损失，抓好治理整顿和深化改革，促进经济持续发展。这场斗争，使我们深感思想政治工作实在是太重要了。今后，我们加强思想教育、反对资产阶级自由化，一定能够顺利开展并取得实效。我们九三学社在经历了最近一番风雨之后，更坚定了接受共产党领导的决心，一定要为贯彻落实中共十三届四中全会提出的各项任务做出应有的贡献。
    蔡子民（全国人大常委会委员、台盟中央主席团主席）说：台盟的同志认为，社会不稳定就谈不上建设，谈不上祖国统一工作；不坚持四项基本原则，国家就会变颜色，成为别国的附庸；不改革开放，我们就没有出路，就会回到封闭落后的老路上。在这场动乱中，台湾国民党当局错误地估计大陆形势，在岛内外掀起一股反共浪潮。台盟盟员与岛内外乡亲有着广泛的联系，我们要通过各种途径，做好岛内外乡亲的释疑解惑工作，帮助他们了解四中全会后大陆的新形势，消除种种疑虑，促进海峡两岸交流，为祖国的繁荣富强和和平统一做出贡献。
    程思远（全国政协副主席、无党派人士）说：长期以来，党同民主党派、无党派人士建立了一种风雨同舟、荣辱与共的密切关系。十一届三中全会以来，这种关系得到了迅速的发展。我们期望以江泽民总书记为核心的党中央继续发扬我们的政治优势，完善党领导的多党合作制度和政治协商制度，调动一切积极因素，团结一切可能团结的力量，把我国社会主义现代化建设事业推向前进。
    荣毅仁（全国人大常委会副委员长、全国工商联主席）说：全国广大工商企业决心在党中央的领导下，为完成稳定经济、治理整顿、深化改革的任务贡献力量。我围绕经济建设工作提出几点建议：第一，充分发挥人民团体、民间渠道的作用，更好地对外宣传我国“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线，促进我国同各国的相互了解，建立友好合作关系。第二，应坚决克服官僚主义，防止扯皮，以利于深化改革开放。要采取有效措施，消除不正之风，惩治腐败，把对外开放更好、更快地开展起来。第三，为搞好经济工作，必须严格把行政权和经营管理权分开，以促进经济发展，吸引外资，推动对外开放。
    阿沛·阿旺晋美（全国人大常委会副委员长、少数民族）说：我坚信以江泽民同志为核心的新的中央领导班子，一定能够领导全党、全军、全国各族人民在坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放，反对资产阶级自由化和社会主义现代化建设的伟大事业中，取得新的更大的成就。以小平同志为代表的老一代革命家，洞察风云，远见卓识，以革命家的胆略，在紧要关头挽救了党，挽救了共和国，我向小平同志为代表的老一辈革命家表示崇高的敬意。
    我们面临着如何增强全体人民的信心，增强党和政府的凝聚力的问题。要有一个雷厉风行的措施，切实纠正党和政府工作中的失误，切实克服、惩治党内各种腐败现象，解决人民群众不满意的问题。
    民族问题，事关国家长治久安和繁荣发展，要解决好。我深知党一贯坚持和倡导各民族一律平等，但具体工作中仍有不少问题。五届人大五次会议通过了民族区域自治法，５年过去了，这个深受少数民族人民欢迎的自治法在实施中，仍存在不少问题。希望党中央、国务院重视解决。
