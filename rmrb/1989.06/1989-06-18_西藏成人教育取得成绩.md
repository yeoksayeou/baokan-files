Adult self-study education in Tibet has achieved good results. Currently, 584 people have passed the higher education self-study examination and obtained college and vocational diplomas, while 5,481 individuals have obtained single-subject passing certificates.

Tibet began implementing the higher education self-study examination system in late 1984. By the first half of this year, a total of ten examinations have been conducted, with the number of participants increasing from over 400 to more than 2,700. The program has expanded from an initial single major in Chinese language to six majors currently. According to a responsible person from the Autonomous Region's Education and Science Commission, the cultivation of these self-study talents has cost Tibet over 500,000 yuan. If these students were to be sent to inland colleges for formal training, at least 13 million yuan would be required.

　　西藏成人教育取得成绩
    本报拉萨六月十八日电  记者刘伟报道：西藏成人自学教育取得较好成绩，目前五百八十四人通过高等教育自学考试获大中专毕业证书，五千四百八十一人次获单科合格证书。
    西藏自一九八四年底实行高等教育自学考试，到今年上半年共进行十次考试，人数从四百多人次增加到二千七百多人次，由最初一个汉语文专业发展到目前六个专业。据区教科会负责人介绍，培养这些自学人材，西藏花费五十多万元，如将这些学员送内地院校正规培训，至少需花费一千三百万元。
