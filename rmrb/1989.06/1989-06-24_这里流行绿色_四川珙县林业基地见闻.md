Here, it is not just the clothing and attire of the people that are predominantly green; the doors of the county government are green, and many units and residential houses also have green doors. A colleague went to the post office to send a letter and, seeing a green door, entered it, resulting in three mistakes.

It is said that the people of Qiong County developed this affection for green after experiencing intense pain. In the early 1950s, this small county in the mountains of southern Sichuan was once a place of lush forests and abundant grain. Later, the campaigns for "steel production" and "communal dining halls" triggered rampant logging, reducing the forest coverage from 40% to 8.2%. "Where you fall, stand up again." Under the leadership of the county committee and the county government, the people of Qiong County began large-scale afforestation in 1974. Fifteen years later, 450,000 mu of artificial forests have been established, increasing the forest coverage to 30%, and the county has been recognized as an advanced unit in national greening efforts.

We ascended to the top of Guanbao Mountain in Luobiao Township and looked out over the vast expanse of forests, which stretched out in waves like a green ocean. The "waves" were composed of one small hill after another, each covered in green from top to bottom, totaling over 1,000 hills.

In Luobiao Township, Township Head Zhang Zhizhong introduced a novel event to us: Feiyue Village's Sixth Group, located on the northern slope of Guanbao Mountain at an altitude of 780 meters, consists of 39 households. In the past, the trees on Guanbao Mountain had been cut down, and the small river had dried up, leaving 80 mu of paddy fields entirely dependent on rain. Since the mountain was reforested, water has gradually returned to the streams, and now all the fields can be fully planted and harvested. Additionally, 21 mu of dry land has been converted into fields, and plans are being made for a 5,000-watt small hydropower station.

Is this true? We visited 52-year-old farmer Yao Guozheng. He spoke even more miraculously: "In the past, our family of six had to fetch water from two li away. Two years ago, I suddenly discovered a spring of clear water in a nearby dry field and diverted it to our home, solving the problem of drinking water for people and livestock. Our four mu of responsibility fields also changed from rain-fed to irrigated fields."

County Forestry Bureau Director Xu Shengru told us: The total investment in afforestation in Qiong County over 15 years, including aid from the United Nations, is approximately 20 million yuan. Now, out of the 450,000 mu of artificial forests, 70,000 mu have already formed a closed canopy. In the past two years, 1,000 mu of 12-year-old fir forests have undergone experimental main felling, with an average yield of 5 cubic meters per mu, selling at 400 yuan per cubic meter, totaling 20 million yuan in revenue. Based on this, 70,000 mu can generate 1.4 billion yuan in revenue, approximately seven times the investment. What about the remaining 380,000 mu? In 15 years, the total output value can reach 16 billion yuan, and the 50,000 farming households in the county can each earn over 30,000 yuan. If you talk about the interest from this green bank, it's no small sum!"

In Minxing Township, we saw a brand-new three-story building, behind which was a lush green fir forest, and the sound of children's voices came from inside. Without asking, we knew it was a primary school. Township Head Li Zhixian told us: "The money to build this primary school came mostly from selling timber." It turns out that since 1974, this township has planted 14,200 mu of fir forests, and in 1987, it underwent experimental main felling, building this primary school.

This direct social benefit from artificial forest resources is not yet widespread in Qiong County, but it has given people hope. The mountains are green, the water is clear, the ecosystem is balanced, and the villages are changing, as is the entire county. In 1988, 93% of the impoverished households in Qiong County had crossed the poverty line; the "tightening spell" of the impoverished mountainous county is gradually being lifted under the green cover.

　　这里流行绿色   
    ——四川珙县林业基地见闻
    张光金　徐坚坚　方小鸿
    到了，珙县。这里不只是人们的衣着打扮是绿色居多，县政府的门是绿色的，许多单位和民房的门也是绿色的。有位同事去邮局交信，见绿门就入，结果导致三次错误。
    据说珙县人这种崇尚绿色的感情，是经过剧烈的阵痛后产生的。５０年代初期，这个位于四川南缘的山区小县，曾是块林茂粮丰的好地方。后来“大炼钢铁”、“大办食堂”诱发了疯狂的乱砍滥伐，使这里的森林覆盖率由４０％降到了８．２％。“在哪儿摔倒的，还在哪儿爬起来。”珙县人在县委和县政府的领导下，从１９７４年开始了大规模的植树造林。１５年过去，４５万亩人工林拔地而起，森林覆盖率上升到３０％，被评为全国绿化工作的先进单位。
    我们在洛表乡观宝山林场登高远眺，只见层层叠叠，莽莽苍苍，整个林区像一片波浪起伏的绿色海洋。组成“波浪”的是一个接一个的小山包，个个从头绿到脚，共有１０００多个。
    在洛表乡，张志忠乡长给我们介绍了这样一件新鲜事：飞跃村六社，在观宝山北腰，海拔７８０米，３９户人家。过去，观宝山上的树被砍光了，小河也干涸了，８０亩水田全靠天。自从山上绿化后，河沟里又逐渐有了水，现在所有的田能满栽满插，还用旱地开田２１亩，眼下又在筹划一座５０００瓦的小水电站。
    这是真的么？我们走访了５２岁的老农姚国政。他说得更神奇：“过去我们一家６口人，吃水要到２华里外的地方去挑。前年我突然发现附近一块旱地里冒出了一股清泉水，便将其引到家中，解决了人畜饮水，４亩责任田也由望天田变成了自流灌溉田。”
    县林业局长徐生恕告诉我们：珙县１５年造林总投入，包括联合国的援助，大约２０００万元。现４５万亩人工林中有７万亩已郁闭成林。近两年对１２年生的１０００亩杉木林进行了实验性主伐，平均每亩产材５立方米，每立方米４００元，共收入２００万元。以此推算，７万亩可收入１．４亿元，大约是投资的７倍。还有３８万亩呢？１５年后总产值可达１６亿元，全县５万农户每户将可收入３万多元。要说这绿色银行的利息，可不是一笔小数目！”
    在民胜乡，我们看到一座崭新的三层楼房，房后是一片翠绿的杉木林，朗朗书声从楼里传出，不用问，这是一所小学校。乡长李志贤对我们说：“建这座小学的钱多半是卖木材来的。”原来，这个乡从１９７４年以来共营造了杉木林１４２００亩，１９８７年进行了试验性主伐，修起了这座小学。
    这种由人工林资源直接转化而来的社会效益在珙县暂时还不普遍，但它给人们带来了希望。山青水秀，生态平衡，乡村开始变了，全县也开始变了。１９８８年，珙县已有９３％的贫困农户跨过了温饱线；贫困山区县的“紧箍咒”，正在绿色掩映下逐步解脱。
