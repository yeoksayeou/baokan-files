The first farmers' literary institute in the nation—Guilin Farmers' Literary Institute—is becoming increasingly vibrant. To facilitate and meet the learning needs of farmers in mountainous areas, the institute has set up classes in rural villages, which has been warmly welcomed by people of all ethnic groups. The picture shows Qin Guoming, one of the founders of the farmers' literary institute and deputy researcher at the Guilin Region Mass Art Museum, guiding students in a farmers' class in Longsheng County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region.
