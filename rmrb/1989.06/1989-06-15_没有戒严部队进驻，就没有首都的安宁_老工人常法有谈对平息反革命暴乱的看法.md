Without the Troops Imposing Martial Law, There Would Be No Peace in the Capital
— An Old Worker, Chang Fahuo, Shares His Views on Suppressing the Counter-Revolutionary Riot

I am an ordinary old worker. For a while, my heart felt like it was burning with a fire, watching the sacred and solemn Tiananmen Square being desecrated and stinking. A group of counter-revolutionary thugs in the capital brazenly attacked the Party and socialism. They committed evil deeds, set up roadblocks, blocked traffic, intercepted military vehicles, and were extremely arrogant. On the afternoon of June 3rd, we took the factory's shuttle bus home from work. When we reached Shuangping, a group of rioters forcibly boarded the bus, insisting on checking if there were any soldiers in the car, and illegally searching our bags, saying they wanted to see if there were any weapons. If we didn't stop, they would throw stones to smash the bus. That night at around 12:30, a hooligan rushed to the bottom of my residential building, shouting, "The soldiers are coming! Everyone, get ready!" Immediately, a group of thugs started moving bricks and stones, and brought out boxes of soda bottles, waiting for the martial law troops to march past the street. They then crazily threw stones and glass bottles like rain at the soldiers. Among these thugs, many were repeat offenders. At that time, I was so angry that my eyes were burning. I wanted to go down and say something, but my wife and daughter held me back tightly, not allowing me to move. They were afraid that if I went down and spoke, those thugs would beat me up. During that time, good people suffered, and bad people were happy. The truth and reason could not be spoken, and rumors and slander were rampant. The state's laws were not taken seriously, but the propaganda from the Voice of America and even Taiwan's counter-revolutionary incitement was treated as gospel. Right and wrong were reversed, and good and evil were confused. The good capital was in chaos, and they said this was to fight for freedom and democracy. Nonsense! In my opinion, these rioters do not understand what democracy is. They are creating a real white terror.

At that time, I could only be angry with myself. Where did we have any personal safety or freedom of speech? Now, things are better. The martial law troops stand tall and proud on the streets, and the patrol teams with red armbands walk around, and the capital's order is immediately restored. The bad guys are afraid and hide, and the people stand up straight with confidence. With the soldiers, we all feel much more secure. If the soldiers had not entered the city to impose martial law, who knows what Beijing would have become.

The soldiers entered the city, and the demons and ghosts quickly fled in silence. Beijing people have returned to a peaceful life. These days, I have been thinking, if it weren't for the bad guys inciting and deceiving some of the common people to block the military vehicles, allowing the martial law troops to enter the capital early to carry out their duties, things might not have turned out so badly.

Beijing is the capital, and Tiananmen Square is the heart of Beijing. However, for a period of time, Tiananmen Square became a gathering place for rioters. There were some who infiltrated the Party and seized some leadership positions; some were university students who had long been influenced by bourgeois liberalization education and the Voice of America; and some were social dregs who harbored deep hatred for the Party and the country. They turned Tiananmen Square into a center for spreading rumors and creating chaos. Some people with ulterior motives occupied the square and even erected a statue of some goddess, because they knew that causing trouble in Tiananmen Square would have an impact on the rest of the country and the world. They wanted to make Tiananmen Square like a sore on the body, hoping that by causing trouble there, they could make other places also chaotic. This time, if the martial law troops had not quickly entered the square and eliminated the "Autonomous Federation of University Students" and the "Autonomous Federation of Workers," how could the rest of the country have so quickly suppressed the riot and restored normal order? Not to mention the rest of the country, on June 1st, the Public Security Bureau arrested several leaders of the illegal organizations, and immediately, people on Tiananmen Square used loudspeakers to incite, surround, and attack the Public Security Bureau, the municipal government offices, and the Ministry of Public Security. In my opinion, without the martial law troops entering Beijing, there would be no peace in the capital, and the country would not have quickly restored normal order. The martial law troops entering some places in Beijing not only stabilized the capital but also played a huge role in stabilizing the situation across the country. We, the working class of the capital, must cooperate with the soldiers to complete the martial law mission well.

During the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot, the martial law troops severely punished the counter-revolutionary rioters and also mistakenly injured and killed some onlookers who were causing trouble. On the night of June 3rd, the radio and television stations repeatedly broadcast the announcements from the Beijing Municipal Government and the martial law troops, repeatedly telling the citizens: "From now on, please do not go to the streets or Tiananmen Square. Workers should stay at their posts, and citizens should stay at home to ensure your safety and avoid unnecessary losses." But many people were careless and did not take the announcements seriously. The soldiers are the people's army, and the military and the people are like fish and water, with deep affection. Some of the onlookers and troublemakers also took advantage of this, daring to ignore the stern warnings in the announcements. In fact, the martial law troops did not want to shoot at the people. But think about it, the martial law troops are here to suppress the counter-revolutionary riot. Facing the rioters who killed and beat soldiers, burned military vehicles, looted weapons, and attacked public security departments, in a critical moment, could the soldiers not severely suppress the counter-revolutionary rioters and not shoot at them? At this time, if you run to watch the trouble, how can the martial law troops distinguish who is good and who is a rioter? Moreover, those who go to the scene to cause trouble and watch, please speak honestly, were you just there to watch the spectacle? What was your intention? Please also look at the people around you who went to watch the trouble, and think calmly, watching and causing trouble not only makes you suffer unnecessary losses, even risking your life, but also, during the soldiers' suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot, it only adds chaos and hinders the work. From an objective point of view, it played a role in shielding the counter-revolutionary rioters and helping them create a false impression of strength. A neighbor of mine who went to watch the trouble from Chongwenmen came back and said painfully, "The soldiers are so pitiful. Some counter-revolutionary rioters mixed in with the onlookers and threw bricks at the soldiers, chasing and beating them. The soldiers feared injuring the people and could not fight back. Watching the rioters brazenly insult and beat the soldiers, watching the rioters cunningly push old people in front to approach and snatch weapons, the martial law soldiers were so frustrated they wanted to cry, begging the onlookers to retreat. It was so hard for the soldiers executing martial law! In this suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot, those who did not follow the announcements and went to watch the trouble played a role in confusing friend and foe, doing things that hurt friends and pleased enemies, adding many unwanted losses for both the martial law troops and the people. Some of the onlookers who were mistakenly injured and killed, and many more soldiers paid a heavy price, sacrificing their precious lives. Just take the soldier who was thrown and then burned to death at Chongwenmen, if it weren't for so many people causing trouble and watching, he might have been able to fight with the rioters or escape. Watching and causing trouble objectively helped the counter-revolutionary rioters a lot, making it very difficult for the troops to execute the martial law mission and quickly restore the capital's normal order. Now, when mentioning the onlookers who were mistakenly injured and killed, some people talk about how the troops did this and that. Honestly, is this fair? Some people now seize this point and try to sabotage military-civilian relations. We must be vigilant against such people with ulterior motives and not be fooled again.

To be honest, in this suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot, those who died included soldiers, civilians who were mistakenly injured, and some who participated in the rioting, looting, arson, and killing. For the rioters, they deserved it! They were rightly killed! But now, people generally say they were all mistakenly killed, and reasonable people can see that this is not practical. Of course, due to the large number of onlookers and troublemakers, the counter-revolutionary rioters became even more arrogant, making it difficult to distinguish the nature of some rioters from those who were mistakenly killed. Isn't this problem also caused by not listening to the announcements and going to watch the trouble?

Some of us seem to be born to love trouble, not thinking things through. The government has spoiled some people too much in recent years. I think the conspirators and counter-revolutionary rioters who instigated this trouble also hit the right spot, using these people's conscious or unconscious shielding to crazily carry out counter-revolutionary activities, until they caused the riot. We should seriously reflect on this bloody lesson and think it over.

　　没有戒严部队进驻，就没有首都的安宁
    ——老工人常法有谈对平息反革命暴乱的看法
    新华社北京６月１４日电  老工人常法有写信给中央有关部门，以自身的经历谈了他对这次平息反革命暴乱的看法。
    这封信内容如下：
    我是一个普通的老工人，前一阵儿心里就像憋了一团火，眼睁睁看着神圣庄严的天安门广场被糟践得乌七八糟，臭气熏人。一伙反革命歹徒在首都肆无忌惮地攻击党，攻击社会主义，他们为非作歹，设路障，堵塞交通，拦截军车，气焰嚣张之极。６月３号下午，我们坐厂子里的交通车下班回家，走到双井，一伙暴徒强行登车，硬要检查我们车里有没有解放军，非法搜查我们提包，说是要看有没有武器，若不停车就扔石头砸。那天夜晚１２点多，一个流氓小痞子匆匆骑车跑到我家楼房下面，大喊解放军快来了，大家快作准备呀！于是一群歹徒马上就搬砖头石块，抬出成箱的汽水瓶，等戒严部队列队从大街经过时，他们就疯狂地把石块、玻璃瓶像雨点似的朝解放军砸去，这伙歹徒中有不少都是二进宫，三进宫的坏蛋。当时我气得两眼冒火，想下去说道说道，老伴和闺女死死拽住我，说什么也不让动，他们怕我下去一开口，就让那帮歹徒给打了。那段时间是好人受气，坏人得意，真话正理不能讲，谣言黑话满天飞，国家的法令不当一回事，倒把美国之音甚至台湾的反革命煽动当成了真经。是非颠倒，黑白不分，好端端的首都叫他们闹得乌烟瘴气，还说这是在争取什么自由民主。呸！叫我说这伙暴徒根本不懂什么是民主，他们搞的是地地道道的白色恐怖。
    那个时候我只有自个儿跟自个儿生气，我们哪儿还有什么人身安全保障和说话的自由？现在好了，解放军戒严执勤的指战员雄纠纠地往街头一站，戴着红箍的执勤小分队在街上巡逻一走，首都的秩序顿时井然，坏人害怕缩了头，群众放心挺起了腰。有了解放军我们都感到心里踏实多了。要不是解放军进城实行戒严，北京城还不知会闹成个什么样呢。
    解放军进了城，妖魔鬼怪就赶紧消声逃遁，北京人又过上了安宁的日子。我这几天总寻思，当初要不是坏人煽动，蒙蔽了一些老百姓也去阻拦军车，让戒严部队早日进驻首都，执行戒严任务，怎么也不会闹成后来那个样吧。
    北京是首都，天安门广场是我们北京的心脏。可是在一段时间内天安门广场成了搞动乱分子聚集的地方。在这里有一些是混进党内并窃取了一些领导职务的反革命分子；有一些是长期受资产阶级自由化教育和美国之音教育的大学生；有一些是对党对国家有刻骨仇恨的社会渣滓。他们把天安门广场变成了散播谣言，制造祸害动乱的中心。一些别有用心的人强占广场，甚至还在那儿树上一个不三不四的什么女神像，就是因为他们看准了，在天安门广场闹事，对全国各地，对世界都会有影响，他们把天安门广场闹成像人身上的溃疡，妄想在那儿一闹腾，就会使外地也发烧，天安门广场乱，外地也跟着乱。这次，要不是解放军戒严部队一举进驻广场，消除了“高自联”“工自联”等这块烂疮，全国各地哪儿能那么顺利地将动乱平息下去，迅速恢复正常秩序。别说全国了，６月１号公安局抓了非法组织几个闹事的头头，天安门广场上不就马上有人通过高音喇叭煽动，包围、冲击了公安局、市政府机关和公安部吗？叫我说，没有戒严部队进驻北京，就没有首都的安宁，就没有全国迅速地恢复正常秩序。解放军进驻北京一些地方戒严执勤，不仅稳定了首都，也对稳定全国的局势起了巨大作用，我们首都的工人阶级一定要配合解放军把戒严任务完成好。
    这次戒严部队在平息反革命暴乱时，严惩了反革命暴徒，同时也误伤打死了一些现场围观、起哄的人，是当天夜里跑去的主儿。３号那天晚上，电台、电视台反反复复，一遍接一遍地播放北京市人民政府、戒严部队的通告，一再对市民说：“从现在起，请你们不要到街上去，不要到天安门广场去。广大职工要坚守岗位，市民要留在家里，以保证你们的生命安全，避免遭受不必要的损失。”可许多人就是大大咧咧，把这当耳边风，根本不把通告当回事。解放军是人民的军队，军民一家亲，有着鱼水之情，一些围观、起哄的主儿，也正因为看准了这一点，才敢置通告的严厉警告于脑后，事实上解放军戒严部队主观上也的的确确不想向老百姓开枪。可请围观、起哄的人想一想，戒严部队是来平息反革命暴乱的，面对着暴徒们枪杀殴打解放军、烧军车、抢军火、冲击公安部门等严重事件，在紧急关头，解放军能不严厉镇压反革命暴徒，能不对他们开枪吗？在这个时候，你跑去围观、起哄、乱哄哄的，让戒严部队怎么分得清谁是好人谁是暴徒？再说到现场起哄、围观的人，请你们凭良心说句老实话，你们仅仅是去看热闹吗？你们的倾向是什么？请各单位的同志也看看，自己身边跑去围观的人又都是些什么情况？退一步冷静地寻思一下，围观、起哄除了使自己遭受不必要的损失，甚至把命也搭上外，在解放军平息反革命暴乱时，只能添乱帮倒忙，从客观上起了掩护反革命暴徒，为他们虚张声势的作用。我的一个街坊从崇文门围观后回来，痛心地说，解放军真惨，一些反革命暴徒混杂在围观、起哄的人群中扔砖头追打解放军，部队战士怕误伤老百姓，无法放手还击，看着暴徒猖狂地辱骂殴打解放军战士，看着暴徒阴险地将老人拥在前头进逼到身边抢夺自己的武器，戒严战士急得要哭，苦苦请求围观的人退下去。弄得执行戒严的战士多难啊！在这场平息反革命的暴乱中，不遵照通告规定前去围观、起哄的人，起了搅混敌我的作用，干了亲者痛仇者快的事，给戒严部队和老百姓都增添了许多谁都不愿看到的损失。一些围观、起哄的人遭误伤枪杀，更多的解放军为此付出了惨重的代价，献出了宝贵的生命。就拿崇文门那个被暴徒摔伤后又被活活烧死的战士来说吧，如果不是许许多多的人起哄围观，他恐怕也能和暴徒拚斗一番或夺路逃生吧。围观、起哄在客观上帮了反革命暴徒的大忙，给部队执行戒严任务，迅速恢复首都的正常秩序帮了个大倒忙。现在一提起被误伤枪杀的围观、起哄的人，有的人就讲部队如何如何，凭良心讲，这公平吗？有个别人现在抓住这点拚命下蛆，企图恶化军民关系，对这种别有用心的人，我们千万要提高警惕，可不能再上当了。
    说实在的，在这次平息反革命暴乱中死去的有解放军战士，有被误伤的群众，还有一些就是参加了搞打砸抢烧杀的反革命暴徒。对暴徒来说是罪有应得！杀得好！可现在笼统一说都讲成误杀，明理的人都能看出这也不实际嘛。当然，由于大量的人围观、起哄，使暴徒的反革命气焰更加嚣张，使某些暴徒与被误杀的人性质一时难以划清，这难题不也是不听通告规定，凑热闹去围观、起哄造成的吗？
    咱们有的人好像天生就爱凑热闹，遇事不掂量掂量。政府这几年把一些人也惯得忒不知天高地厚了。我看这次煽风点火的阴谋家和反革命暴徒也是号准了这根脉，才把一些人煽呼起来，靠着这些人有心无心的掩护，疯狂地进行反革命活动，直到闹成暴乱，这血的教训咱们应该好好琢磨，寻思寻思了。
