Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 20th.

The Ministry of Justice today held a seminar on studying Deng Xiaoping's important speech, attended by some legal scholars from the capital. The participants pointed out that the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital is a struggle to uphold the dignity of the Constitution and to defend socialist legal system.

Professor Sun Guohua of the Law School at Renmin University of China said that the broad masses of students who demanded the advancement of democratic politics, the elimination of corruption, and the opposition to "official profiteering" had wishes that were in line with the Party and the people's government, and with the aspirations of the people of all ethnic groups across the country. However, under the conditions of our country, to build socialist democracy, it is necessary to strengthen the socialist legal system. This is a basic common sense and a profound lesson from the "Cultural Revolution." A small number of people took advantage of the students' desire to advance democratic politics and led them astray from the beginning, aiming to destroy the legal system. Their goal was to overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship and the People's Republic, but their attempts will never succeed.

Wang Shuwen, vice-president of the China Law Society, said that to maintain the long-term stability and prosperity of the country, those who blatantly violate the Constitution and laws and attempt to overthrow socialist China must be severely punished according to law. At the same time, it is necessary to distinguish between two different types of contradictions. It is also important to strengthen ideological and political education for the masses, including education on the Constitution and laws, so that they can correctly understand the spirit of the Constitution and laws and establish the concept of observing the Constitution and laws.

Professor Gao Mingxuan of the Criminal Law School at Renmin University of China pointed out that for a period of time, slogans like "Let the world be filled with love" spread widely, blinding our vision. In fact, domestic and foreign hostile forces have never given up their plots to destroy us. They have never loved us and have never stopped their evil schemes to oppose the Communist Party, overthrow the socialist system, and subvert the People's Republic of China. The class struggle has never stopped since the founding of the nation; it is just that the methods and scale of the struggle have changed. This counter-revolutionary riot, orchestrated by a small number of people, is the largest and most horrifying counter-revolutionary criminal activity to have occurred in the capital since the founding of the nation. It is an objective manifestation of the law of class struggle that is not subject to human will. This counter-revolutionary riot has awakened us, making us once again realize our true situation.

Chen Guangzhong, vice-president and professor of criminal procedure law at the China University of Political Science and Law, Professor Wu Jie of constitutional law at the People's Public Security University, and Lan Mingliang, president of the Law Press and an expert in international law, also spoke at the seminar.

Minister of Justice Cai Cheng said in his concluding remarks that in this extremely serious political struggle, our legal researchers, educators, and judicial workers must align their thoughts and actions with the spirit of Deng Xiaoping's important speech. All legal education activities, research activities, and the business work of judicial organs must help uphold the dignity of the Constitution and laws and help in the suppression of counter-revolutionary rioters' criminal activities.

Vice Ministers of Justice Jin Jian, Lu Jian, and Guo Dezhi attended the seminar.

　　首都部分法学家座谈邓小平讲话时指出    
    平息暴乱为维护宪法  建设民主须加强法制
    新华社北京６月２０日电  司法部今天召开有首都部分法学家参加的学习邓小平同志重要讲话座谈会。与会同志指出，平息首都反革命暴乱的斗争，是一场维护宪法尊严、捍卫社会主义法制的斗争。
    中国人民大学法理学教授孙国华说，本来广大学生要求推进民主政治、消除腐败现象、反对“官倒”的愿望，与党和人民政府的主张，与全国各族人民的意愿是一致的。但是，在我国条件下，要建设社会主义民主，就必须加强社会主义法制，这是起码的常识，也是“文化大革命”的深刻教训。极少数人利用青年学生要求推进民主政治的愿望，从一开始就把他们引向了破坏法制的歧途，这样做的目的是为了推翻人民民主专政、推翻人民共和国，但这些人的企图是永远也不能得逞的。
    中国法学会副会长王叔文说，为了维护国家的长治久安，对于肆意破坏宪法和法律，妄图颠覆社会主义中国的极少数暴乱分子，必须依法严惩。同时，要注意严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。还要加强对广大群众的思想政治教育，其中包括进行宪法和法律的教育，使他们正确理解宪法和法律的精神，树立遵守宪法和法律观念。
    中国人民大学刑法学教授高铭暄指出，一个时期里，“让世界充满爱”之类的歌声、口号不胫而走，蒙蔽了我们的视线。其实，国内外敌对势力亡我之心不死，他们从来没有爱过我们，从来没有放弃过反对共产党、推翻社会主义制度、颠覆中华人民共和国的罪恶阴谋。革命同反革命的斗争建国以来从来没有停止过，只是斗争的方式和规模有所变化而已。这次由极少数人阴谋策动的反革命暴乱，是建国以来在首都发生的规模最大、最骇人听闻的一次反革命犯罪活动，是不以人们的意志为转移的阶级斗争客观规律的表现。这场反革命暴乱擦亮了我们的眼睛，使我们再一次清醒了自己的认识。
    中国政法大学副校长、刑诉法教授陈光中，中国政法大学民法学教授巫昌祯，中国公安大学宪法学教授吴杰，法律出版社社长、国际法专家兰明良等也在座谈会上发了言。
    司法部部长蔡诚在会议结束前发言说，在这场极其严肃的政治斗争中，我们的法学研究、教学工作者，司法工作者，要把思想和行动统一到邓小平同志的重要讲话精神上来，一切法学教育活动、研究活动和司法机关的业务工作，都要有助于维护宪法和法律的尊严，有助于打击和镇压反革命暴乱分子的犯罪活动。
    司法部副部长金鉴、鲁坚、郭德治出席了座谈会。
