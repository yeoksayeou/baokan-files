Title: The True Intentions of Japan's New Trade White Paper

Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry officials have penned the "Heisei 1 Trade White Paper," which has received the approval of the Cabinet and is now being published and distributed. Unlike previous trade white papers that were bland and comprehensive, this year's white paper is sharply focused, both offensive and defensive, with the true intention of refuting and defending.

The sharp edge of the refutation is naturally directed at the United States, which recently used the Super 301 clause of the Omnibus Trade and Competitiveness Act to accuse Japan. The white paper devotes considerable space to analyzing the problems in the U.S. economy, aiming to show that the responsibility for the U.S.-Japan trade imbalance lies largely with the United States. The white paper points out that the problems in the U.S. economy are, on a macro level, determined by large fiscal deficits, low personal savings, and a consumption-driven economy. On a micro level, there is a lack of supply capacity, and no production base has been established to meet market demand. This has resulted in a structure where increased demand leads to increased imports, making it difficult to eliminate the trade imbalance.

Commentators believe that in the atmosphere of renewed tension in U.S.-Japan economic friction, the white paper represents the official Japanese response.

The new trade white paper devotes a significant portion to discussing Japan's major changes in 1988: a significant increase in product imports and a substantial increase in overseas investments. In 1988, Japan's total imports amounted to $187.4 billion, an increase of 25.3% over the previous year. Manufactured goods accounted for 49% of total imports. Export products remained dominated by high-value-added products such as semiconductors and fax machines, with corporate export strategies shifting from "emphasizing market share" to "emphasizing profits." In 1988, Japan's direct overseas investments reached $47 billion, approximately four times the amount in 1985. The white paper believes that with the expansion of product imports and the increase in overseas investments, it can be expected that Japan's trade structure will become internationally coordinated.

Although the white paper emphasizes that Japan has made significant efforts to adjust its external trade imbalance, the fact remains that Japan's annual trade surplus with the United States is still around $50 billion. Compared to the per capita product import figures of major Western countries, Japan ranks last. It is well known that buying Japanese cameras and VCRs in the United States and the United Kingdom is cheaper than in Japan. The white paper also cites examples of perfume, lipstick, and golf balls in Tokyo being 20% to 60% more expensive than in New York and Paris, and acknowledges that Japanese consumers pay attention to price and quality when choosing products, not just the country of origin.

From this, it can be seen that Japan's contribution to international trade, compared to its own strength and potential, still has room for improvement. The white paper's analysis and proposed strategies in this regard are relatively weak, giving the impression that while the attack is forceful, the defense has gaps, and the dissection of others is more thorough than the dissection of oneself.

In fact, there is no need for Japan to emphasize this; it is evident to all. As former U.S. Ambassador to Japan Mansfield said, the Japanese market is not as closed as Americans accuse it of being, nor is it as open as the Japanese promote it to be. In recent years, Japan has made significant progress in expanding imports. However, Japan, which has prospered from free trade, still has a long way to go to fulfill its promise of becoming a "world importer."

### 日本新贸易白皮书的真意

　　日本新贸易白皮书的真意
    本报记者  于青
    日本通产省人士执笔的《平成元年版贸易白皮书》，昨天得到内阁的首肯，开始出版发行。与历年贸易白皮书四平八稳、面面俱到的文风不同，今年的贸易白皮书重点鲜明、攻守兼顾，真意在于反驳和辩护。
    反驳的锋芒，自然指向前不久凭借《综合贸易法案》超级三○一条指责日本的美国。白皮书用不少笔墨剖析美国经济的弊病，意在表现日美贸易不平衡的责任大部分在美国方面。白皮书指出，美国经济中的问题，宏观上是财政赤字大、个人储蓄少、超前消费体制决定的。微观上是供给能力不足，没有建立满足市场需求的生产基础。形成了需求增加，进口也增加的结构，贸易不平衡痼疾难除。
    评论家认为，在日美经济摩擦再趋紧张的气氛中，白皮书是代表日本官方的反论。
    新贸易白皮书用较大篇幅谈及日本去年的主要变化是：产品进口显著扩大，海外投资大幅增加。一九八八年日本进口总额为一千八百七十四亿美元，比上一年增长百分之二十五点三。制成品进口占总进口的百分之四十九。出口产品仍以半导体、传真机等高附加价值产品为主，企业出口战略由“重视市场占有率”转向“重视收益”。一九八八年日本海外直接投资达四百七十亿美元，是一九八五年的约四倍。白皮书认为，伴随产品进口扩大，海外投资增加，可以期待，日本的贸易结构将变为国际协调型。
    尽管白皮书着意表明，为改变对外贸易不平衡，日本调整经济结构费力不小。但是，日本每年对美贸易黑字五百亿美元高居难下仍是事实；与主要西方国家中人均产品进口额相比，日本倒数第一也是事实；众所周知，在美国和英国买日本的照相机和录相机比在日本便宜。白皮书也例举了东京的香水、口红、高尔夫球价格比纽约、巴黎等城市贵百分之二十至百分之六十，并承认日本消费者在选择商品时注意价格和质量，不拘泥于生产国。
    由此可见，日本在国际贸易领域的贡献，与其自身的实力和潜力相比，还有差距。白皮书对这方面的分析和提出的对策相形见绌，给人的印象是，进攻有力度，防守有漏洞，解剖他人严于解剖自己。
    其实，不需日本极力表白，人们有目共睹。正如前美国驻日大使曼斯菲尔德所说，日本市场并不像美国人指责的那样关闭，也不像日本人宣传的那样开放。近年来，日本扩大进口确有长足进步。但受惠于自由贸易而致富的日本，要实现“成为世界的进口吸收器”这一许诺，还要努力。　　（本报东京六月十日电）
