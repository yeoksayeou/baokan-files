Beijing's commercial and service sectors resumed full operations on June 12, and since then, market order has gradually improved, with residents' savings in banks showing an upward trend.

Walking through the streets, watermelons have begun to appear in large quantities, and fresh vegetables are everywhere. The bustling Wangfujing, Xidan, and Qianmen streets have seen a noticeable decrease in the number of transient outsiders, but the number of customers in large commercial centers like Beijing Department Store and Dong'an Market is increasing daily. The first-class restaurants in the city remain relatively quiet. According to a staff member at Dong'an Market, sales a few days ago were down by 40% compared to usual, leading to a significant increase in inventory, particularly for daily necessities and food items. Recently, with a focus on counter service and door-to-door delivery, sales have been gradually improving.

It is reported that after the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China's savings offices resumed normal operations, on June 14, residents' savings increased by 1.6 times compared to June 12, with dollar deposits rising by 12%, and withdrawals from banks decreasing by 72%.

Residents' savings in the past few days have continued to show a sustained growth trend.

　　首都市场秩序好转
    居民储蓄日渐上升
    本报北京６月１６日讯  记者赵兴林报道：北京商业服务业自６月１２日全面恢复营业以来，市场秩序日渐好转，居民在银行储蓄呈上升趋势。
    漫步街头，西瓜已陆续大量登市，新鲜蔬菜随处可见。繁华的王府井、西单和前门大街，外地流动人口明显减少，但北京百货大楼、东安市场等大型商场的顾客逐日增加。市内一级饭庄仍较清闲。据东安市场有关同志介绍，前几天的销售额比平时下降４０％，造成部分商品，特别是日用商品和食品库存明显上升。近来，由于狠抓了柜台服务和送货上门，销售额日渐提高。
    据悉，市工商银行储蓄所恢复正常营业之后，６月１４日，居民储蓄比１２日增长１．６倍，美元存款上升１２％，从银行取款减少７２％。
    这几天的居民储蓄，仍保持持续增长的好势头。
