Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 8th.

Today, reporters saw on Chang'an Avenue in the capital that the martial law troops, in cooperation with local authorities, along with personnel from the public security and sanitation departments, are working together to remove barricades and clean up garbage, striving to fully restore traffic on Chang'an Avenue as soon as possible.

Currently, many sections of Chang'an Avenue are already passable for pedestrians and bicycles, but some areas with many burned vehicles are temporarily difficult to clear. At the Xidan intersection, there are more than ten burned electric cars and military vehicles tangled together. Reporters saw dozens of soldiers pushing a burned car to the side of the road, and a local heavy-duty truck, with the help of soldiers, was using steel cables to pull a damaged bus to the side of the road. On the road, there were also teams of soldiers sweeping the road surface with brooms and shovels.

At the head of the Fuxingmen overpass, the political department head of a martial law unit told reporters that since June 4, three groups of rioters have been active in this area. They have captured two groups. Another group has kidnapped six soldiers whose whereabouts are unknown, and they are currently pursuing them.

The Tiananmen Square has been basically cleaned up, and some sanitation workers are there using trucks to remove garbage. At the Jinshui Bridge, a reporter asked a responsible person from a martial law unit when Tiananmen Square would be able to resume traffic. This person said they are working on it. He believes that with the help of the citizens, Tiananmen Square will soon be able to resume traffic.

　　军民一起清除长安街路障垃圾
    天安门广场基本清扫干净很快可恢复通行
    新华社北京６月８日电  记者今天上午在首都长安街上见到，戒严部队在地方的配合下，与公安、环卫等部门的人员一起清除路障，打扫垃圾，争取尽快全面恢复长安街的交通。
    目前，长安街的许多路段行人和自行车已经可以通行，但个别地段因被烧毁的车辆较多，一时难以清除。在西单十字路口，有十多辆烧毁的电汽车和军车盘错在一起。记者见到几十名解放军战士正将一辆烧毁的汽车推到路旁，还有一辆地方上的载重汽车在战士的帮助下用钢丝绳将一部毁坏的大客车拉到路边。马路上还有一队队的战士，手持扫帚、铁锨在打扫路面的垃圾。
    在复兴门立交桥头，戒严部队某部政治部主任对记者说，６月４日以来这个地区有三股暴徒活动。他们已抓获两股。另有一股劫持了６名战士不知去向，现正在追捕中。
    天安门广场基本清扫干净，一些环卫工人正在那里用汽车清运垃圾。记者在金水桥旁，问戒严部队某部一位负责人天安门广场什么时候能恢复通行，这位负责人说，他们正在努力。他认为，在市民的协助下，天安门广场很快就可以恢复通行。
