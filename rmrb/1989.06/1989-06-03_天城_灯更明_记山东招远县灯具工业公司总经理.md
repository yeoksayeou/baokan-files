The company producing "Tiancheng" brand lamps, the Shandong Zhaoyuan County Lamp Industry Company, is a village-run enterprise. Despite the national policy of tightening credit, it has not only not stagnated or shrunk but has instead been full of vitality. In 1988, its output value reached 31 million yuan, with profits of 3.15 million yuan, both increasing by 41% and 39% respectively compared to 1987. In the first three months of this year, its output value increased by 56% compared to the same period last year, and sales revenue and profits doubled.

People are amazed and curious, wanting to know the secret behind this success.

The key lies in the company's leader, Sun Zhijian, who, in the face of an unfavorable climate for township enterprises, calmly analyzed the situation and re-established the company's guiding ideology and business strategies.

In the latter four to five months of last year, bank credit funds were only being withdrawn and not lent out. This was a blow to Sun Zhijian, who had been thinking of expanding. He couldn't sit still. He ran to the county, the city, and the province to seek loans, but to no avail. He couldn't understand it, he vented his anger... but he quickly calmed down. He thought: We can't change the national policy of tightening credit, so we must adapt to the situation. From now on, we should focus on using our own money to do our own business. Soon, he came up with a plan:

	• Sell commercial housing. In recent years, the company had used its accumulated funds to build over 20,000 square meters of residential buildings for the villagers, who all lived there for free. Now, by selling these houses, the company earned 880,000 yuan.
	• Stop all non-production expenditures. The company's office building and grand hall designs were locked away, and all raw materials were sold off. The 300,000 yuan allocated for buying a car was withdrawn, and a telegram was sent to recall it. These measures saved 1.3 million yuan.
	• Seek funds from management. First, reduce unreasonable raw material and product inventories, actively clear up problematic accounts receivable, and turn 3.17 million yuan of "dead" funds into "live" funds; second, in conjunction with the implementation of the contract responsibility system, determine the amount of circulating funds for each factory, workshop, and department, stipulate the use of quota funds, and pay interest at the normal rate, deducting the increased interest from the bonus fund.

Buildings cannot do without lamps, and with the state's reduction in building construction, the lamp market is inevitably sluggish. The number of customers coming to the company to place orders dropped from an average of over a hundred to less than 40. The eight sales outlets set up across the country were deserted, with sales plummeting; the more than 120 salespeople scattered across the country were all complaining that they couldn't sell their products. Sun Zhijian proposed: "The market changes, and so do we. We follow the market."

He categorized the existing products, immediately stopping the production of 315 types of ordinary pendant lamps and wall lamps that were not selling well. For the 650 types of products in 13 series that were popular in the market, such as luxury, functional, and energy-saving types, he invested an additional 1.2 million yuan to nearly double the production capacity.

He organized the development of new products based on market demand.

To quickly bring out new products, Sun Zhijian adjusted the technical team, established a new product development office, and organized top technical personnel to work day and night on design and trials. At the same time, he sent sales personnel to Fuzhou and Shanghai to purchase energy-saving fluorescent lamp tubes. In less than two months, they invested over 900,000 yuan. They successively developed 3 series of 35 new products, which were well received in the market. In the first three months of this year, new products accounted for 68% of the company's total sales revenue.

    “天城”灯更明
     ——记山东招远县灯具工业公司总经理孙志坚
    郭心刚　宫德琪　冷海强
    生产“天城”牌灯具的山东招远县灯具工业公司，是一家村办企业，在国家紧缩银根的大气候下，它，不但没有停滞、萎缩，相反充满了生机。1988年产值达到3100万元，利润实现315万元，分别比1987年增41％、39％；今年头三个月，产值比同期增长56％，销售收入、利润翻了一番。
    人们赞叹、惊讶！都想知道其中之奥妙。
    说来也很简单，关键是企业的当家人孙志坚，能在大气候不利于乡镇企业发展的情况下，冷静地分析问题，重新确立企业发展的指导思想和经营策略。
    去年的后四、五个月，银行的信贷资金只收不放。这给满脑子都是扩张大上的孙志坚当头一棒。他坐不住了。跑县、跑市、跑省，争取贷款，均无济于事。他想不通，他发脾气……但他又很快冷静下来。他想：国家紧缩信贷的大政方针咱改变不了，识时务者为俊杰，往后的主要精力要下在用自己的钱办自己的事上。很快有了办法：
    ——出售商品房。近几年，这个公司用积累为本村农民建造了2万多平方米的住宅楼，大伙都白住。现在一出售，收入88万元。
    ——非生产性开支一律停止。公司的办公楼、大礼堂图纸锁进了柜子里，原材料统统处理掉了。购买小轿车的30万元钱划出去了，一个电报要了回来。这几项，省下资金130万元。
    ——向管理要资金。第一招，压缩不合理的原料、产品库存，积极清理有问题的应收货款，把317万元的“死”资金变“活”了；第二招，结合落实承包制核定各厂、车间、科室流动资金额度，规定使用定额资金，按正常利率付利息，增加的利息从奖励基金中扣除。
    楼堂馆所离不开灯具，国家压缩楼堂馆所建设，灯具市场难免不景气。每天来公司订货的客户，由以往的平均上百人减为不足40人。设在全国的8个销售商店，门庭冷落，销售锐减；撒在全国的120多名销售人员，也纷纷叫喊卖不出去。孙志坚提出：“市场变，咱也变，跟着市场走。”
    他把现有的产品分类排队，对平销的普通花吊灯、普通壁灯等315种产品，立即停止生产。对市场畅销的豪华型、功能型、节能型等13个系列650种产品，增加投资120多万元，扩大生产能力近一倍。
    他根据市场的需求，组织力量开发新产品。
    为尽快拿出产品，孙志坚一面调整技术力量，成立了新产品开发办公室，组织拔尖技术人员昼夜进行设计试制，一面派供销人员去福州、上海订购节能型荧光灯管。不到两个月的时间，他们共投资90多万元。先后试制开发了3个系列35种新产品，受到了市场的欢迎。今年1至3月份全公司的销售收入新产品占到了68％。
