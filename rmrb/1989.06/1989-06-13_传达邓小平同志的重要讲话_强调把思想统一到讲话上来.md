The Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council held a meeting for leaders of various departments this morning in Zhongnanhai to convey Deng Xiaoping's important speech delivered on June 9 to senior military officers of the capital's martial law troops.

The meeting was presided over by Li Peng, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee and Premier of the State Council. Qiao Shi, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, conveyed Deng Xiaoping's speech.

Attendees included Yao Yilin, Tian Jiyun, Li Tieying, Wu Xueqian, Song Ping, Qin Jiwei, Ding Guan'gen, Yan Mingfu, Wen Jiabao, Ji Pengfei, Peng Chong, Ni Zhifu, Chen Muhua, Wang Boping, Song Jian, Wang Fang, Li Guixian, Chen Xitong, Chen Junsheng, Ren Jianxin, Liu Fuzhi, Hu Qiaomu, and Sima Yimaiti Aimaidi.

After conveying Deng Xiaoping's speech, Li Peng and Yao Yilin both delivered important speeches.

Li Peng said, Deng Xiaoping's important speech deeply analyzed the causes, nature, and the correctness of the measures taken in response to this counter-revolutionary rebellion. It also deeply expounded on the correctness of the line, principles, and policies formulated by our party since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. The Party Central Committee and the State Council require department leaders to take the lead, organize Party members and the masses, and, in conjunction with the actual situation of their units and their own thoughts, seriously study Deng Xiaoping's important speech. They must eliminate ambiguous understandings and unify everyone's thoughts with the speech.

Li Peng said, opposing this counter-revolutionary rebellion is a struggle concerning the life and death of our party and state. From April 15 to now, over two months, the situation has continuously developed. It first evolved from a student movement to turmoil and finally to a counter-revolutionary rebellion. The Party Central Committee carefully analyzed the situation at each stage and took corresponding correct policies. By mid-May, Beijing was in a state of anarchy, and the turmoil had spread to some major cities outside the capital. If martial law measures and the deployment of troops had not been taken in parts of the capital, this counter-revolutionary rebellion, which could have spread nationwide, would not have been suppressed. In suppressing this rebellion, our army made tremendous contributions. They are truly the people's army and the staunch defenders of the party and socialism. We should express our respect to them and pay silent tribute to the officers and soldiers who sacrificed their lives in suppressing this counter-revolutionary rebellion.

Li Peng said, on June 4, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and the command of the Central Military Commission, the People's Liberation Army, armed police, and public security officers cleared Tiananmen Square. This marked the initial victory in suppressing this counter-revolutionary rebellion. The tasks before us now are to restore normal order, severely crack down on counter-revolutionary rebels, and stabilize the situation. Currently, the traffic, social, and living orders in the capital have begun to recover, and production is gradually resuming. Nationwide, the situation is gradually stabilizing. The leadership of the Communist Party of China is strong, our People's Liberation Army is united, our people's government is capable of effectively exercising its functions, and we are able to completely suppress this counter-revolutionary rebellion that mainly occurred in the capital, Beijing.

Li Peng required that the central and state council departments continue to implement the central deployment, firmly guard their posts, and do a good job in their respective departments. The various ministries and commissions of the State Council should continue to implement the tasks proposed in the government work report adopted at the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, and strive to complete the tasks of this year's economic environment rectification, economic order rectification, and comprehensive deepening of reforms.

In his speech, Li Peng required that the departments do a good job in the following six aspects:

First, continue to stabilize prices. The work to stabilize prices this year has generally been effective. The price increase in the few months after February was basically the same as the same period last year, and there was a slight decrease in May. However, the work to stabilize prices remains very arduous, and we must not relax in this regard.

Second, strive for a good harvest this year, with the total summer grain production possibly reaching or exceeding the 1986 historical high. All departments and governments at all levels across the country should actively organize the harvest and procurement of summer grains and oils. The financial situation this year has generally been good, with urban and rural savings increasing and currency circulation better than last year. Governments and financial institutions at all levels should be prepared for procurement funds and strive to eliminate the phenomenon of issuing IOUs.

Third, continue to compress basic construction investment, strictly control the growth of consumption funds, carry out the "double increase and double savings" campaign, and do a good job in increasing revenue and saving expenses. From January to May, the country's production did not experience a significant decline, but the unreasonable production structure has not improved significantly, and the growth of state-owned large enterprises is slow, while the growth of collective enterprises is too fast. In the future, we must continue to adjust the production structure and focus on using funds in energy, transportation, raw materials, and products that guarantee market demand. Due to the counter-revolutionary rebellion in June, production has been affected. All departments and enterprises should organize the masses of workers to display the spirit of being masters, and make up for the losses. Agricultural production must continue to be grasped, and efforts must be made to arrange the supply of agricultural production materials well. The flood season is approaching, and local governments at all levels must strengthen flood control work. Every effort must be made to achieve a good harvest this year. After this rebellion is completely suppressed, we must take practical measures to rectify the mistakes in our work. We must seriously and objectively clean up the corruption and bureaucratism that exist in the party's organization and government work. These tasks cannot be done superficially or formally; they must be done thoroughly and concretely, so that the people can truly feel that our government is a government that serves the people.

Fourth, take this opportunity to make some demands on the media. In the struggle to suppress this turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, the media in the capital has done a lot of work in cooperation with the party's policy, especially a few newspapers, radio stations, and television stations, which have taken a firm and clear stance and played a very good role. However, due to the errors of a few comrades in the Party Central Committee in guiding news work, they deviated from the party's stance, causing some news organizations to make wrong public opinion guidance in suppressing this turmoil and rebellion. This can be said to be the result of the long-term spread of bourgeois liberalization. Public opinion guidance is a very important matter. We sincerely hope that the media will quickly stand on the side of the party and the people, redouble their efforts, propagate the central policies, further expose the crimes of counter-revolutionary rebels, inspire the people's fighting spirit, and make due contributions to achieving the complete victory in suppressing this rebellion.

Fifth, in diplomacy, we must adhere to an independent and peaceful foreign policy. Our policy of opening up to the outside world will not change. A few countries in the international community have taken advantage of China's suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion to create various rumors, stirring up an anti-China wave and putting pressure on us. We must warn them that the Chinese people who have stood up will not yield to such pressure. Rumors will not last long, and the facts will eventually be revealed to the world. We hope that all countries that want to maintain and develop friendly relations with China will look further ahead and not do anything at this time that hurts the feelings of the Chinese people.

Sixth, it is particularly important to emphasize adhering to the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, that is, taking economic construction as the center, adhering to the four cardinal principles, and adhering to reform and opening up. The lessons of this counter-revolutionary rebellion are profound, and we must reflect on them well. An important point is that for a considerable period of time, we have relaxed the construction of spiritual civilization and ideological and political work, and we must take measures to correct this.

Yao Yilin said in his speech, Deng Xiaoping's speech is a guiding document, and we must unify the thoughts of the entire party and the people of the whole country with it. We must seriously study it, and the leaders must take the lead. This is the fundamental way to do a good job in the future. We must be very soberly aware that we cannot establish a bourgeois republic; otherwise, our country will only become a vassal state of the bourgeoisie and will lose its independence.

Leaders of various directly affiliated units of the CPC Central Committee, various ministries and commissions of the State Council, and various directly affiliated institutions attended the meeting today.

　　中共中央国务院召开各部门负责人会议
    传达邓小平同志的重要讲话
    强调把思想统一到讲话上来
    李鹏姚依林分别作重要讲话要求做好六个方面工作
    新华社北京６月１３日电　中共中央、国务院今天上午在中南海召开各部门负责人会议，传达邓小平同志６月９日接见首都戒严部队军以上干部时的讲话。
    会议由中共中央政治局常委、国务院总理李鹏主持，中共中央政治局常委乔石传达邓小平同志的讲话。
    出席会议的有姚依林、田纪云、李铁映、吴学谦、宋平、秦基伟、丁关根、阎明复、温家宝、姬鹏飞、彭冲、倪志福、陈慕华、王丙乾、宋健、王芳、李贵鲜、陈希同、陈俊生、任建新、刘复之、胡绳、司马义·艾买提等。
    在传达完邓小平同志讲话后，李鹏、姚依林分别作了重要讲话。
    李鹏说，邓小平同志的重要讲话，深刻地分析了这场反革命暴乱产生的原因、性质和我们采取的措施的正确性，深刻地阐述了党的十一届三中全会以来我们党制订的路线、方针和政策的正确性。党中央、国务院要求各部门领导带头，组织党员和群众，结合本单位实际情况，结合自己的思想，认真学习邓小平同志的这一重要讲话，消除模糊认识，把大家的思想统一到讲话上来。
    李鹏说，反对这场反革命暴乱，是关系到我们党和国家生死存亡的一场斗争。从４月１５日到现在，近两个月时间里，事态不断地发展，先由学潮发展到动乱，最后发展到反革命暴乱。党中央在每个时期都经过仔细分析，采取了相应的正确的政策。到了５月中旬，北京已处于无政府状态，并且蔓延到外地一些大城市。如果对首都的部分地区不采取戒严措施，不派军队，这场有可能蔓延到全国的反革命暴乱就不可能平息。在平息这场暴乱中，我们的军队做出了巨大的贡献，他们不愧为人民的子弟兵，不愧为党和社会主义的坚强捍卫者。我们应该向他们表示敬意，向在这次平息反革命暴乱中光荣牺牲的指战员默哀。
    李鹏说，６月４日，在党中央的领导下，在中央军委的指挥下，人民解放军、武装警察部队和公安干警，对天安门广场进行了清场，这标志着平息这场反革命暴乱取得了初步胜利。现在摆在我们面前的任务是恢复正常秩序、严厉打击反革命暴乱分子。现在，首都的交通秩序、社会秩序和生活秩序已经开始恢复，生产也逐步在全面恢复。就全国来说，局势正在逐步地稳定。我们中国共产党的领导地位是坚强的，我们的人民解放军是团结的，我们的人民政府是能够有效地行使职能的，我们是能把这场主要发生在首都北京的反革命暴乱完全平息下去的。
    李鹏要求中央和国务院各部门在最后平息这场反革命暴乱中，继续贯彻中央的部署，坚守岗位，做好本部门的工作。国务院各部委要继续贯彻在七届全国人大二次会议通过的政府工作报告中提出的各项任务，努力完成今年治理经济环境、整顿经济秩序、全面深化改革的任务。
    李鹏在讲话中要求各部门当前要做好６个方面的工作：
    一是继续稳定物价。今年以来稳定物价的工作总的说是有成效的，２月份以后几个月的物价上涨幅度基本与去年同期持平，到５月份还有所下降。但是，稳定物价工作仍然十分艰巨，在这方面我们不能有丝毫的松懈。
    二是争取今年农业有个好收成，夏粮总产有可能达到或超过１９８６年历史最高水平。各部门和全国各级政府要积极组织好夏季粮油的收获和收购工作。今年以来金融形势基本上是好的，城乡储蓄增加，货币回笼好于去年。各级政府和金融单位，要在收购资金上作好准备，力争打白条的现象不再发生。
    三是要继续压缩基本建设投资，严格控制消费基金增长，开展双增双节运动，做好增收节支工作。１到５月份，全国的生产没有出现大的滑坡现象，但生产结构不合理状况还没有明显改善，国营大企业生产增长的慢，集体企业增长的过快。今后还要继续调整生产结构，把资金重点用在能源、交通、原材料和保障市场需求的产品上。６月份由于发生了反革命暴乱，生产受到了损失，各部门和企业要组织广大职工发扬主人翁精神，把损失夺回来。对农业生产一定要继续抓紧，努力安排好农业生产资料的供应工作。汛期快到了，各级地方政府要加强防汛工作。要千方百计争取今年农业有个好收成。这场暴乱彻底平息后，要采取切实措施，克服我们工作上的失误。我们要认真地、实事求是地清除在党的机体上、在政府的工作上存在的腐败和官僚主义现象。做好这些工作，不能敷衍、不能表面化，要切切实实，让人民切身感到我们的政府是为人民服务的政府。
    四是借此机会，向舆论界的同志提点要求。在平息这次动乱和反革命暴乱的斗争中，首都舆论界配合党的政策做了大量工作，特别是有几家报纸、电台、电视台，态度坚定，旗帜鲜明，起到了很好的作用。但是，由于党中央的少数同志在新闻工作的指导上有错误，离开了党的立场，致使一些新闻单位在平息这场动乱和暴乱中作了错误的舆论导向。应当说，这是长期以来资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥的结果。舆论导向是一件非常重要的事情。我们恳切地要求舆论界迅速地站到党和人民的立场上来，加倍努力工作，宣传中央的方针，进一步揭露反革命暴乱分子的罪行，鼓舞人民的斗志，为争取平息这场暴乱的彻底胜利做出应有的贡献。
    五是在外交方面，我们要坚持独立自主的和平外交政策。我们的对外开放政策是不会改变的。国际上有少数国家借我国平息反革命暴乱之机，制造各种谣言，掀起了一股反华浪潮，向我们施加压力。我们要正告他们已经站起来的中国人民是不会屈服于这种压力的。谣言是不会长久的，事实终将大白于天下。我们希望一切愿意与中国保持和发展友好关系的国家把眼光放远一点，切不要在这个时候做出伤害中国人民感情的事。
    六是特别要强调坚持党的十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针、政策，即以经济建设为中心，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放。这次反革命暴乱的教训是深刻的，要很好地反思。重要的一点是在相当长的时间里，放松了精神文明的建设，放松了思想政治工作，我们要采取措施予以纠正。
    姚依林同志讲话说，邓小平同志的讲话是纲领性的文件，要以此统一我们全党、全国人民的思想。我们要认真学习，领导要带头。这是我们搞好今后工作的根本。我们要非常清醒地认识到，我们不能建立一个资产阶级共和国，否则我们的国家将只能成为一个资产阶级的附庸国，就会丧失独立性。
    中共中央各直属单位、国务院各部委和各直属机构的负责人，出席了今天的会议。
