Yen Continues to Depreciate
Exchange Rate with Dollar at 151 to 1

BEIJING, June 15 (Xinhua) - Today, the Tokyo foreign exchange market closed with the dollar to yen exchange rate at 1:151.30. This is the lowest level the yen has reached against the dollar in one year and 10 months.

Following the dollar to yen exchange rate breaking through 1:140 at the end of May, it has now surpassed the 1:150 mark in just half a month.

Local investors believe that the main reason for today's yen depreciation is the expectation that the U.S. trade deficit will further improve after the release of the U.S. April foreign trade figures tonight (Japanese time). As a result, investors are selling yen and buying dollars.

　　日元持续贬值
    对美元汇率一五一比一
    本报东京６月１５日电  记者于青报道：今天日本东京外汇市场收盘时，美元对日元比价为１∶１５１．３０。这是一年１０个月以来，日元兑换美元的最低水平。
    继５月末美元对日元比价突破１∶１４０后，在半月之内又突破１∶１５０大关。
    此间投资家们认为，今天日元下跌的主要原因是，继３月份美国贸易赤字下降以来，今天晚上（日本时间）预定发表美国４月份外贸数字，美国贸易赤字将进一步改善，故抛售日元，抢购美元。
