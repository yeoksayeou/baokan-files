Due to the decline in oil prices, the number of young laborers in the Gulf countries has increased, coupled with the influx of large numbers of cheap foreign labor in the 1970s, the unemployment problem in the Gulf Arab countries has become increasingly prominent in recent years.

According to a United Nations research report, by the year 2000, the total population of the Cooperation Council countries (Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, and the United Arab Emirates) will reach 27.9 million, with only 18.6 million in 1989. The age structure of the Gulf countries is relatively young, with people under 20 years old accounting for more than half of the total population, and this number continues to grow at an annual rate of 3.6%. Therefore, the governments of the Gulf countries are deeply concerned about the employment of their own citizens.

The Director of the Bahrain Labor Bureau recently told foreign journalists that the current unemployment rate in Bahrain has reached an average of 10%. A Saudi newspaper published an official report in October last year stating that the number of Saudis looking for work in 1987 increased by 13% compared to the previous year.

It is believed that the main reason for the rising unemployment rate in the Gulf countries is the large number of expatriate workers occupying the Gulf labor market, taking jobs from locals. For example, in Bahrain, expatriates make up one-third of the population. In Saudi Arabia, expatriates make up one-third of the 13 million population. In the private sector, expatriate workers account for as high as 90%. In Kuwait, Qatar, and the United Arab Emirates, expatriates have exceeded two-thirds of the local population, with expatriate workers in the private sector accounting for more than 98%, and local labor accounting for less than 2%.

To solve the employment problem of local labor, the governments of the Gulf countries are taking some effective measures. First, in state-owned enterprises and departments, they are trying to use local labor as much as possible, while encouraging and persuading the private sector to adopt the same policy. The Bahraini government has formulated a plan to arrange for 20,000 Bahrainis to be employed in the private sector over the next five years, replacing the original expatriate workers. A Saudi government official said that in the new five-year plan starting in August this year, emphasis will be placed on developing labor productivity, expanding the labor market, and increasing employment opportunities, requiring private enterprises and businessmen to hire more Saudi nationals.

Economic figures in the Gulf say that most of the Cooperation Council countries attach importance to and emphasize the employment of local labor in state-owned enterprises and departments, and have achieved results. However, the results in the private sector are not ideal. Nevertheless, the above measures taken by the Gulf countries will, to a certain extent, guarantee the employment of their own citizens and restrict expatriate workers.

　　海湾国家失业问题
    本报记者  吴文斌
    由于石油价格下跌，海湾各国劳动市场的年轻劳力人数增加，加之７０年代外国廉价劳动力大量涌入这一地区，近年来，海湾阿拉伯国家的失业问题日益突出。
    据联合国的一项研究报告预测，到２０００年合作委员会国家（巴林、科威特、阿曼苏丹国、卡塔尔、沙特阿拉伯和阿联酋）的总人口将达到２７９０万，１９８９年只有１８６０万，海湾国家人口的年龄结构比较年轻，２０岁以下的年轻人占总人口的一半以上，并且仍以年率３．６％的速度持续增长，因此，海湾各国政府对本国国民的就业问题深为关注。
    巴林劳动局长最近对外国记者说，目前，巴林的失业率平均到达１０％，沙特报纸去年１０月份公布的一份官方报道说，１９８７年沙特人寻找工作的人数比前一年增加了１３％。
    人们认为，海湾国家失业率上升的主要原因是，大量外籍劳动力占领了海湾劳动市场，抢了本国人的饭碗，比如，在巴林的外籍人占巴林人口的１／３。在沙特，外籍人占其１３０万人口的１／３。而在私人部门中的外籍人从业人员则高达９０％。在科威特，卡塔尔，阿联酋的外籍人已超过本国人口的２／３，这三个国家的私人部门中的外籍劳工占９８％以上，本国劳力不到２％。
    为了解决本国劳动力的就业问题，海湾各国政府正在采取一些有效措施，首先，在国营企业和部门，尽量使用本国劳动力，同时，鼓励和说服私人部门采取同样政策。巴林政府已制定了一项计划，准备５年内在私人部门安排２万巴林人就业，顶替原来的外籍劳工。沙特政府官员说，在今年８月份开始实施的新的５年计划中，将强调发展劳动生产力，扩大劳动市场，增加就业机会，要求私人企业和实业家，更多地雇佣沙特本国劳力。
    海湾经济界人士说，大多数海湾合作委员会国家重视和强调在国营企业和部门雇佣本国劳力，已取得成果。但在私人部门结果尚不理想，然而，海湾各国的上述措施必将在一定程度上保障本国公民的就业，使外籍劳工受到限制。
