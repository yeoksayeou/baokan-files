Title: The National Party of South Africa Stumbles Through Nearly Half a Year

A series of dramatic developments have repeatedly shaken South African society.

Since the beginning of this year, the ruling National Party has been plagued by internal turmoil. Power struggles, reform setbacks, and price increases have become the three major crises facing the National Party and its government.

The National Party's misfortune began with the President's stroke.

On January 18, President Botha suddenly suffered a mild stroke. The National Party was immediately thrown into disarray. Two weeks later, Botha surprisingly announced his resignation as the party chairman, bringing the internal struggle for leadership to the surface.

After a fierce competition, the chairman of the Transvaal provincial party committee and the Minister of National Education, de Klerk, was elected as the new leader of the National Party.

Due to Botha's refusal to step down as President according to tradition, a conflict between him and the new chairman immediately erupted. The struggle inevitably ended with Botha's defeat as public support waned. First, Botha's proposal to separate the positions of State President and Party Chairman was rejected. The National Party's decision-making body decided that the new chairman should still hold both positions, signaling the end of Botha's political career. Second, to allow the new chairman to quickly ascend to the presidency and escape the awkward situation of having a position without power, the National Party decided to hold elections in September this year, thwarting Botha's plan to delay the elections until 1990.

Just as the internal power struggle was intensifying, three cabinet ministers were forced to resign due to their involvement in economic and political scandals. Facing attacks from the opposition on both sides, the National Party's reputation was in tatters.

During this period, South Africa's economic situation, especially the market situation, became increasingly severe, with bread and butter becoming the main topics of street gossip.

Gold prices continued to fall, the rand depreciated repeatedly, oil prices surged twice, and the price increases for telecommunications, transportation, bread, and corn all reached double digits. Inflation and increased taxation made private sector-led economic reforms difficult.

The fate of political reform was even worse. The political reforms, which were originally intended to patch up the fence, encountered setbacks everywhere.

Originally, Acting President Botha's announcement to repeal the Group Areas Act should have been able to inject some vitality into the stagnant reforms, but it was thwarted by the main opposition party, the Conservative Party. The Conservative Party fully restored apartheid measures in the areas it controlled, while the National Party seemed helpless.

The Minister of Constitutional Development and Planning, Botha, believed that the Group Areas Act, the Separate Amenities Act, and the Population Registration Act were the three major obstacles to inter-racial dialogue, and the government had the obligation to remove these obstacles. Furthermore, in early May, he proposed a bold plan for a "one parliament, one cabinet" with representatives from all races. However, since the essence of this plan was still to maintain the minority rule of whites, it was naturally rejected by the leftist forces. The right-wing, on the other hand, saw it as a "betrayal of whites."

Botha was in a dilemma and resigned in anger. The resignation of this close friend of Botha and the "architect" of South African reform, as well as the resignation of a Minister of the Interior before him, resulted in the National Party losing the heads of the provincial party committees in the Cape Province and Natal Province within two days. This led to another crisis for the National Party government, with a total of six cabinet ministers resigning within half a year.

Analysts believe that Botha's resignation marked the failure of Botha's reforms.

Coincidentally, the involvement of South African diplomats in the arms smuggling scandal in Western Europe was exposed, and France and Britain expelled three South African diplomats each, causing South Africa to lose face internationally.

As the National Party struggles in its predicament, the Progressive Federal Party, the Independent Party, the National Democratic Movement, and the "Fourth Force" and other leftist organizations announced the formation of the Democratic Party on April 8.

Faced with the "revolutionary atmosphere" and the impending elections, the National Party, which is anxious and on the verge of elections, can only maintain its "political advantage" by extending the state of emergency again. Nearly 300 deputies will travel to various places in the coming weeks to campaign. It can be predicted that the economic situation, taxation, prices, and political reforms will still be the main contents of their election speeches.

After stumbling through the first five months of this year, the National Party of South Africa has an indescribable sense of frustration. However, with the elections approaching and the situation becoming more severe, greater challenges lie ahead.

    南非国民党跌跌撞撞近半年
    新华社记者　陈启民　张永兴
    一连串戏剧性的事态发展使南非社会频受震动。
    今年以来，执政的国民党内风波迭起。权力斗争、改革受挫、物价上涨成了困扰国民党及其政府的三大危机。
    国民党的厄运从总统中风开始。
    一月十八日博塔总统突患轻度中风。国民党顿时乱了阵脚。两周后，博塔出人意料地宣布辞去国民党总裁之职，使党内争夺领导权的斗争表面化。
    经过急剧较量，特兰士瓦省党部主席、国民教育部长德克勒克被选为国民党新领袖。
    由于博塔不肯按惯例放弃总统职位，他和新总裁的冲突随即爆发。斗争不可避免地以人心背离的博塔败北而告终。首先，博塔企图把国家总统和执政党总裁二职分离的方案遭到拒绝，国民党决策机构决定，新总裁仍应身兼二职，从而宣告博塔的政治生涯行将结束。其次，为使新总裁早日登上总统宝座，摆脱有职无权的尴尬处境，国民党决定今年九月六日举行大选，打掉了博塔欲到一九九○年举行大选的拖延计划。
    正当党内权力斗争激烈进行之际，偏偏三名内阁部长因分别卷入经济和政治丑闻而被迫辞职。面对反对党左右夹攻，国民党声名狼藉。
    这期间，南非经济形势，特别是市场形势日益严峻，面包和黄油成了街谈巷议的中心话题。
    金价持续下跌，兰特一再贬值，石油价格两次陡涨，电讯交通、面包玉米的涨价幅度均达两位数。通货膨胀，税收加重。以私有化为核心的经济改革步履维艰。
    政治改革的命运更糟。本来不过是修补篱笆的政治改革处处受挫。
    本来，代总统许尼斯宣布废除集团区居住法修正案一举应该可以给萎靡不振的改革注入某种生机，却因主要反对党保守党的阻挠而未果。保守党在它所控制的地区全面恢复种族隔离措施，而国民党居然表现出束手无策。
    宪法发展和计划部长许尼斯认为，集团区居住法、分离社交活动法和居民登记法是各种族对话的三大障碍，政府有义务排除这些障碍。进而，他在五月初提出包括各种族代表参加的
  “一个议会，一个内阁”的大胆计划。但由于这项计划的实质仍然是维护白人的少数统治，理所当然地被左派力量所拒绝。而右派则视之为“对白人的背叛”。
    许尼斯进退维谷，愤然辞职。这位博塔挚友和南非改革的
  “设计师”的辞职，以及在此前一名内务部长的辞职，使国民党两天内失去开普省和纳塔尔省两位省党部负责人，并使半年内辞职的内阁部长达六名。这形成了国民党政府的又一次危机。
    分析家认为，许尼斯挂冠标志博塔改革的破产。
    凑巧，南非外交官参与西欧军火走私劣迹败露，法国和英国分别驱逐三名南非外交官，使南非政府在国际上大丢其丑。
    当国民党在困境中挣扎时，进步联邦党、独立党、全国民主运动及“第四力量”等左派组织于四月八日宣告结成民主党。
    对“革命气氛”惶遽不安而又濒临大选的国民党，只有靠再次延长紧急状态维持其“政治优势”。近三百名议员将于几周内分赴各地，奔走呼号。可以预计，经济形势、税收物价、政治改革等仍将是他们竞选演说的主要内容。
    南非国民党在跌跌撞撞地走过今年头五个月后，有说不出的受挫感。然而，大选在即，形势严峻，更大挑战还在前面。
