Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 19th.

	By the end of May, China's automobile industry had produced 240,000 vehicles this year, a 5% increase over the same period last year.

	The state's key development areas—heavy-duty vehicles, microcars, and sedans—saw increases of 43%, 42%, and 28% respectively. The situation of "too few heavy-duty vehicles and too many light-duty vehicles" is rapidly improving. Major automobile enterprises in First Automobile Works, Second Automobile Works, Nanjing, Jinan, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Shenyang have all completed or exceeded their production plans. Factories are actively improving production balance rates and the rate of first-class assembly. At Second Automobile Works, an "East Wind" vehicle rolls off the assembly line every two and a half minutes.

	According to a report from our correspondent Lin Gang, the State Council has decided to resume the production of the Red Flag high-end sedan.

	It is understood that the resumption of Red Flag sedan production will be carried out in two stages. In the first stage, based on the old Red Flag model, a partial improvement will be made. The upcoming Red Flag CA770AL type high-end sedan will retain its original body shape, but the interior will be more modernized. In addition to being equipped with a wireless telephone, it will also use imported car air conditioning equipment and electric window lifters.

	In the second stage, the design of a new generation of Red Flag sedans is underway. Through foreign consultations, the overall reliability, comfort, and luxury of the vehicle will be significantly improved. The new car is planned to be launched in 1992.

　　我国汽车生产持续增长
    国产红旗轿车恢复生产
    新华社北京６月１９日电  截至５月底，我国汽车行业今年累计生产汽车２４万辆，比去年同期增长５％。
    国家重点发展的重型车、微型车、轿车分别增长４３％，４２％，２８％。国产汽车“缺重少轻”的局面正在迅速改观。一汽、二汽和南京、济南、天津、上海、沈阳等地的一批汽车重点骨干企业全部完成或超额完成生产计划。各厂积极提高生产均衡率和整车装配的一等品率。在二汽，每两分半钟就有一辆“东风”开下总装配线。
    本报讯　记者林钢报道：国务院确定，我国恢复生产红旗牌高级轿车。
    据悉，恢复生产红旗轿车将分两步走。第一阶段，在老红旗基础上作局部改进，将要推出的红旗ＣＡ７７０ＡＬ型高级轿车，身车外形不变，但内饰将更加现代化。除装有无线电话外，还选用进口汽车空调设备和电动玻璃升降器等。
    第二阶段，正在设计新一代红旗轿车，通过国外咨询，使整车的可靠性、舒适性、豪华性有较大的提高。新车计划１９９２年问世。
