Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 15th.

This afternoon, leaders of Beijing Municipality, on behalf of the ten million citizens of Beijing, warmly welcomed the relatives of martyr Choi Kukjeong from his hometown.

Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong, holding the mother of the martyr's hand, said: "I saw your speech on television, which showed the high level of awareness of a soldier's mother, and it is very worthy of our learning. Thank you, thank you for raising a good son for the country." The mother of martyr Choi Kukjeong, Wen Guilin, holding back tears, said, "Kukjeong did this for the people's interests and made the ultimate sacrifice, which should be attributed to the good leadership of the Party. Although the child has sacrificed himself, I, as his mother, feel proud. She strongly demanded: "Those who slaughtered the soldiers of the Liberation Army must not be lenient."

Beijing Municipal Committee Secretary Li Ximing said: "The criminals who killed martyr Choi Kukjeong have already been caught, but we must mobilize the masses to dig out those hidden in the 'rat holes,' one by one, and bring them to justice, avenging the fallen soldiers of the Liberation Army."

Today, the leaders of Beijing Municipality presented memorial items to the mother of martyr Choi Kukjeong. Those who participated in the meeting included Vice Governor Gao Wen of Jilin Province, leaders from Huinan County, and the commanding officers of the unit where martyr Choi Kukjeong served.
