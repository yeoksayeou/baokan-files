The power of communist conviction can be deeply felt in the life of Dong Shusen, a national and provincial labor model and former director of the Chengde High-Pressure Valve Factory in Longhua County, Hebei Province.

In the autumn of 1979, the elderly Dong, suffering from multiple ailments, underwent his eighth nasal polyp removal surgery. During the procedure, cancer cells were unexpectedly discovered. The unusual "notification" informed him that his time to work for the Party and the people was limited. However, he thought that he could not be intimidated by cancer and that he should make every day meaningful and productive.

During his 43-day hospitalization in Beijing, as soon as he could get out of bed, he helped the medical staff with cleaning, sweeping the toilets, caring for fellow patients, and doing ideological work, never resting for a moment. To ensure that patients and medical staff had hot water in the morning, he would get up at 5 a.m. every day to boil water, even on the day of his discharge.

In 1984, the organization arranged for the elderly Dong to step down to the second line, but he voluntarily took on the responsibility for logistics and construction work. This was originally the full workload of a deputy director, involving numerous tasks and heavy responsibilities. Whether it was a broken boiler, inadequate heating, unboiled water in the water room, poor meals in the canteen, or problems arising during construction, he would strive to solve them without hesitation. He would arrive early and leave late, generally working more than 10 hours a day.

Workers said that as long as Dong could stand, he would not rest.

Since 1979, except for his treatment in Beijing and a month of rest at home, Dong had basically not left his post. He often said that he was racing against death, as he might suddenly collapse and never stand up again. To ensure a smooth handover of his work, he meticulously documented and archived every task.

Over the years, he directly oversaw the construction of the chemical and physics office building, new factory buildings, the main entrance hall, and rockery, which improved the factory's office and production conditions, beautified the environment, and saved the factory a significant amount of money during construction. Every year during the selection of county-level outstanding party members, all the party members in the factory unanimously voted for "Old Dong."

In the past few years, he has handled hundreds of thousands of yuan worth of materials. Some people thought this was a "lucrative opportunity" to build a few houses without drawing attention. However, he still lived in an old house, slept on a large kang (traditional heated bed), and the courtyard wall was built by his wife using bricks she collected.

Someone asked Dong, "In the work you oversee, don't you leave any room for retreat or backup?"

He answered with his actions: In matters of public affairs where he had the authority, he would never trade power and money.

Soon after taking over the construction work in 1984, he discovered multiple quality issues with the project. He insisted on having the construction team rectify the problems according to the contract and compensate for the losses.

Over the past decade, Dong has not yielded to cancer, nor has he retreated in the face of improper practices. He has always maintained the integrity of a Communist Party member. The CPC Chengde Municipal Committee and the Longhua County Committee have both conferred upon him the honorable title of Outstanding Communist Party Member.

    ——记优秀共产党员董树森
    彭怀
    在河北省隆化县，不少人说，在全国和省级劳动模范、隆化县承德高压阀门厂原厂长董树森身上，可以深深感觉到共产主义信念的力量。
    １９７９年秋，患有多种疾病的老董，在做第８次鼻息肉切除手术时，突然发现了癌细胞。那张不同寻常的“通知单”告诉他，今后为党为人民工作的时间不多了。但是，他想到的是不能被癌症吓倒，活一天也要活得充实，有意义。
    在北京住院的４３天，他刚能下床就帮医护人员搞卫生，扫厕所，护理病友，做思想工作，一刻也闲不住。为保证病友和医护人员早晨喝上开水，他每天５点钟起床烧水，连出院那天也没忘先烧好开水。
    １９８４年，组织上安排老董退到二线，他又主动要求负责总务和基建工作。这原来是一名副厂长的全部工作，事务繁杂，责任重大。锅炉坏了，暖气不热，水房的水不开，食堂的伙食不好，直至施工中出了问题，他都尽力解决，不怕麻烦。他每天早来晚走，一般工作１０小时以上。
    工人们说，老董是个只要站得起来，就躺不住的人。
    １９７９年以来，老董除了在北京治疗和在家休息一个月外，基本上没有离开工作岗位。他常说，自己是在和死神争夺时间，说不定哪天突然倒下就再也站不起来了。为使别人好接自己手里的事，每项工作他都做得条理清楚，有详细的记录和档案。
    几年来，由他直接负责兴建的理化办公大楼、新厂房、大门厅、假山石，改变了厂子的办公、生产条件，美化了环境，并在施工中为工厂节约了不少资金。年年评选县级优秀党员时，全厂党员异口同声——“老董！”
    这几年他经手百万元的物资，有人认为这是“大有油水可捞的美差”，“趁机盖三、五间房子也不显山露水”。可他仍住旧房子、睡大炕，院墙还是老伴捡砖头垒起来的。
    有人问老董，在你主持的工作中，你就不留退路和后手吗？
    他用实际行动回答：在自己说了算的公家事情上，决不拿权力和金钱做交易。
    １９８４年他接管基建工作后不久，查出工程质量多处不合格问题，坚持按合同责成工程队返修，赔偿损失。
    十年来，老董没有在癌症面前屈服，更没有在不正之风面前退却。他始终保持了共产党员的本色。中共承德地委和隆化县委分别授予他优秀共产党员的光荣称号。
