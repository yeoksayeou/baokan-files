    **Judge Commits Injustice: Accuser Turns into Accused**
    **Former Head of Yongzhou Court Sentenced to Four and a Half Years**

    **Report from our newspaper:** Peng Jian, the former president of the Yongzhou Municipal People's Court in Hunan Province, was recently sentenced to four years and six months in prison by the Intermediate People's Court of Lingling District for abusing his power and framing others. Peng appealed to the Hunan Provincial High Court, which recently upheld the original verdict after a final review.

    Peng Jian was elected as a municipal people's representative and court president in February 1987. In April of the same year, Peng's wife, Zhu, accused him of having an inappropriate relationship with a female official, which made Peng resentful. On May 4, Peng filed for divorce from Zhu with the intermediate court. Subsequently, he forged documents supposedly signed by Zhu, including a "confession," "guarantee," and divorce agreement, falsely accusing Zhu of long-term adultery and multiple abortions. On April 27 of the same year, the female official sued Zhu for defamation, slander, and infringement of personal reputation. Peng then personally forged a "questioning record," fabricating and exaggerating the facts related to the case. To sow discord within Zhu's family, Peng had a relative of Zhu copy materials supposedly revealing information from within the family, which he then reproduced and distributed. Peng also violated legal regulations regarding "self-recusal," using his authority to directly intervene in the case. On November 4 of the same year, Peng pre-arranged for Zhu's arrest, notified the judicial committee members to convene a meeting, and before the meeting, set the tone for Zhu's arrest. Under Peng's deception and influence, the judicial committee made the erroneous decision to arrest Zhu. After the meeting, Peng personally procured handcuffs, borrowed a car, and assigned personnel to execute Zhu's arrest. Due to Peng's illegal actions, Zhu was wrongfully imprisoned for 8 days, then released on bail pending trial. It was not until February 9, 1988, that the intermediate court's second-instance trial ruled Zhu not guilty, clearing her name after 97 days of wrongful imprisonment. During Zhu's bail period, Peng wrote a petition in someone else's name, circulated it at a district-wide lawyers' meeting, and continued to demand criminal charges against Zhu.

    Peng Jian's retaliatory actions against Zhu attracted the attention of various sectors of Yongzhou society. Based on Zhu's report of Peng's issues, the municipal committee promptly organized relevant departments to conduct an investigation. Peng believed this was the result of the district committee's legal affairs leader interfering, and thus harbored a grudge against this leader. From August 1987 to February 1988, Peng wrote seven defamatory and framing materials, widely distributing them in society, and mailing them to higher-level relevant departments and news agencies.

    The police arrested Peng Jian on February 18 of this year.

    法官却枉法  诬告反被告
    原永州法院院长被判刑四年半
    本报讯　湖南省永州市人民法院院长彭剑因徇私枉法、诬告陷害，最近被零陵地区中级人民法院依法判处有期徒刑四年零六个月。彭不服，上诉到湖南省高级人民法院，最近经省高院终审裁定，驳回上诉，维持原判。
    彭剑于1987年2月被选为市人民代表、法院院长。1987年4月，彭剑因其妻朱某
  （已于1988年1月离婚）告发其与一位女干部有不正当男女关系而心怀不满，于5月4日向中级法院提起与朱离婚的诉讼，随后又伪造了所谓朱某签名的“交待”、“保证”和离婚协议，诬朱与他人长期通奸并堕过胎。同年4月27日，那位女干部以侮辱、诽谤和侵犯公民名誉权对朱提起诉讼。接着彭剑亲笔伪造了所谓“问话笔录”，捏造和夸大了此案有关“事实”。为了离间朱一家的内部关系，要朱的一亲属按其书写的内容抄写“来自朱家内部的检举”材料，尔后彭复印散发。彭还违背法律有关“自行回避”的规定，利用职权直接插手该案的处理。同年11月4日，彭事先要人做好捕朱的准备，然后通知审判委员会委员开会。会前，彭发言定下捕朱的调子，在彭的欺骗和影响下，审判委员会作出了捕朱的错误决定；会后，彭又亲自找手铐、借汽车，指定执行捕朱任务的人员。由于彭的枉法行为，致使朱被捕入狱，被无辜关押8天，后取保候审，到1988年2月9日中院二审终审裁定无罪，含不白之冤97天。在朱被取保候审期间，彭以他人名义书写了呼吁书，在全区律师工作会议上拉人签名，继续要求追究朱的刑事责任。
    彭剑打击报复朱某的行为，引起了永州市社会各界人士的关注。根据朱告发彭的问题，市委及时组织有关部门进行调查。彭认为这是地委分管政法的领导插手干预的结果，因而对这位领导怀恨在心，从1987年8月到1988年2月，彭先后书写了七份诬告、陷害材料，向社会广为散发，并邮寄上级有关部门和新闻单位。
    警方于今年2月18日依法将彭剑逮捕。
