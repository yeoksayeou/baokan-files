Your newspaper published a letter on February 22nd on the first page titled "Garbage Blocks the Path, Villagers Have a Hard Time Getting Through." Since then, the villagers of Baipeng Village have been eagerly waiting for the Shuangmen Oil Field to remove the "garbage mountain" on the main road. However, not only has the "garbage mountain" not been removed, but it has been growing bigger day by day. The people are complaining, but the environmental protection department of the oil field seems to be blind and deaf to the issue. This is from Henan Province, Biyang County, Liu Jiafu.
