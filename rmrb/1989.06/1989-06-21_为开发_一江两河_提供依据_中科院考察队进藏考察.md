A 50-person team from the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Qinghai-Tibet Plateau Comprehensive Scientific Expedition entered Tibet in mid-May and has begun conducting multi-faceted scientific surveys focused on agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry in the middle reaches of the Yarlung Zangbo River, Lhasa River, and Nyangchu River. This effort aims to provide a scientific basis for resource development and economic planning in this region by the end of the century.

The middle reaches of the "One River, Two Streams" in Tibet include 18 counties, county-level cities, and districts in Lhasa, Shannan, and Shigatse, covering a total area of 65,700 square kilometers with a population of 760,000. The region has 1.515 million mu of cultivated land, producing 52.5% of the autonomous region's annual grain output, making it a major commercial grain-producing area. These regions have over 600,000 mu of cultivable wasteland, more than 400,000 mu of usable grasslands, and vast areas of suitable forest land. The region is rich in water resources, has relatively good transportation conditions, and is relatively developed in terms of culture and education. It has the characteristics of rapid resource development and utilization, with significant benefits.
