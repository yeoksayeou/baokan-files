Since May, the 100,000 employees of the Yangtze River Steamship Company have steadfastly maintained their positions, ensuring the smooth and orderly operation of the 2,648-kilometer waterway from Luzhou to Shanghai. This period has seen an attendance rate of over 98%.

On more than 30 passenger routes, over 140 operating passenger ships and tourist vessels have all adhered to strict schedules. In early June, when a large number of passengers switched from roads and railways to waterways, the company promptly adjusted and increased the number of voyages, ensuring that passengers could travel safely and on time.

From May to June 19, over a span of 50 days, the company completed nearly 50 million passenger trips, with a passenger turnover of 11 billion passenger-kilometers. Additionally, the company transported over 900 million tons of cargo. This has played a crucial role in meeting the urgent needs of industrial and agricultural production along the river in six provinces and one municipality, ensuring the transportation of key national materials, and supporting the lives of the people and the travel of foreign guests.
