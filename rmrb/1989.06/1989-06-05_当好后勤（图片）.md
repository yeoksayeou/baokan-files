    Doing a Good Job in Logistics

    The Weicheng District Agricultural Materials Company of Weifang City, Shandong Province, was established in March this year. It has established a work system based on agriculture, formed an agricultural materials inspection and investigation team, and carried out targeted procurement, supply, and sales business. This has met the demand for agricultural materials in the district and provided good logistics support for the farmers. (Photographed by Zhang Lu Tian)
