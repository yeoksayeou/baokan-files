Our construction of literary history, apart from the need for a "rewriting" that corrects past errors, should also focus on exploring new frameworks and research methods for literary history. Reverse research in literary history is one such approach we can try.

The rapid development of literary creation and literary concepts in the new era has allowed us to re-examine the entire history of Chinese ancient and modern literature with new perspectives. Thus, the call to "rewrite literary history" has grown louder. Many scholars have written articles to reassess writers, works, and trends that were previously considered "settled" in literary history, giving them a more reasonable historical position in today's view. This is undoubtedly significant and valuable for correcting the biases and errors in literary history from the ultra-leftist era. However, our construction of literary history should not be satisfied with this. Apart from rewriting the literary history of the past 50 years in terms of content and form, it should also include new explorations of the overall framework and research methods of literary history. Reverse research in literary history is one such exploratory approach.

Every literary phenomenon is part of the historical vertical connection. From any literary phenomenon as a point of view, this vertical connection can be studied from both forward and reverse directions. Forward research is conducted in the order of literary historical development, mainly grasping the connection between this literature and previous literature, seeking the origins, traditions, causes, and historical background of this literature. Reverse research is conducted in the opposite direction of literary historical development. It mainly grasps the relationship between this literature and later literature, that is, understanding its significance and value from the perspective of its changes, influences, results, and historical fate. In the study of literary history, we not only need to understand its "causes" from previous literature but also need to reverse the process and examine its "consequences" from later literature, and in the complex historical changes of contradictions or unity between the two, we can see through this phenomenon.

However, throughout history, most literary history books have been written according to the convention of studying later literature from earlier literature, following the path of forward research to examine literary phenomena. Although many researchers with broad perspectives have touched upon reverse research to some extent, such as often using the aesthetic consciousness of the new era to re-evaluate past writers and works, often using some active traditional elements in later literature to re-understand the significance of historical heritage, the shortcoming is that these are mostly limited to empirical and intuitive understanding (although this is also very valuable), and almost no one has regarded reverse research as an important method in literary history research, giving it sufficient attention and conscious application.

In fact, with the development of literary history and the full unfolding of its richness, and with people's understanding of literature gradually becoming more comprehensive and deepening (such as the new explorations of semiotics, hermeneutics, and reception aesthetics on the literary process), it has been increasingly confirmed that regardless of a writer's work or a certain trend, its significance and value are often not fully revealed in its contemporary era but gradually emerge in the subsequent historical development. To deeply understand the past literary history, one cannot avoid conducting forward research, that is, grasping its rise and fall from the previous literary tradition and contemporary situation, and at the same time, one must "reverse" the process and discover the hidden or obscured characteristics of previous literature in the developed later literature. Because the new elements in contemporary literature that belong to the future can only sprout and grow in later literature; the hidden literary development diseases in previous literature can also only be fully exposed in later literature.

Reverse research in literary history also includes reverse examination of literary history itself. By studying the different understandings of the literary process by literary histories of different eras, one can grasp the trajectory of changes in aesthetic concepts from another angle.

The birth of a true literary work or the appearance of an important literary trend generally leads to repeated descriptions and evaluations by later literary historians. Due to different aesthetic tendencies in different eras and different academic personalities of different literary historians, the same literary phenomenon often appears differently in different literary history works, sometimes even with completely opposite evaluations. This is the intrinsic reason why literary history, although already written by others in the past, must be rewritten by each new era with its own perspective. By examining the different evaluations of the same literary phenomenon by literary histories of different eras, one can not only more three-dimensionally and richly understand the research object but also discover and grasp the historical trajectory of changes in aesthetic concepts from another angle, that is, from the differences in evaluations of the same work by different eras.

For example, Tao Yuanming is undoubtedly a great writer with extremely high artistic achievements in Chinese literary history. However, during his lifetime and for a considerable period afterward, this was not recognized or valued by literary historians. Liu Xie's "Wenxin Diaolong: Tixing" lists and praises 12 outstanding writers from the Han to the Jin dynasties, including Jia Yi, Sima Xiangru, Yang Xiong, Liu Xiang, Ban Gu, Zhang Heng, Wang Can, Liu Zhen, Ruan Ji, Ji Kang, Pan Yue, and Lu Ji, but does not mention Tao Yuanming at all. Zhong Rong's "Shi Pin" evaluates five-character poems from the Han and Wei to the Southern Dynasties, placing a large group of poets in the "upper category," but Tao Yuanming is also excluded. Other important literary works from that time and afterward, such as Shen Yue's "Song Shu: Xie Lingyun Zhuan Lun," Pei Zhiwei's "Diao Chong Lun," and Xiao Zixian's "Nan Qi Shu: Wen Xue Zhuan Lun," also have a similar attitude toward Tao Yuanming as Liu Xie and Zhong Rong. It can be seen that from the Jin to the Northern and Southern Dynasties, literary historians had a very limited understanding of Tao Yuanming's achievements. After the rise of the Tang Dynasty's ancient prose movement, Tao's poetry became increasingly valuable, and through the strong advocacy of Li Bai, Du Fu, and especially Su Shi, Tao Yuanming finally established his position as a great poet. From the later praise of Tao Yuanming, we can see the coldness of Tao Yuanming in the past, and by discussing the reasons for his praise and coldness, can we not deepen our understanding of the characteristics of Tao's poetry and grasp the historical process of changes in literary aesthetic concepts from the perspective of critical reception? Even with just one example of Tao Yuanming, the comprehensive reverse examination of literary histories of various important literary phenomena throughout the ages will yield even greater results.

Reverse research in literary history is multi-layered. Once a literary phenomenon appears in history, it will continue to have an impact in the subsequent literary river, sometimes hidden and sometimes revealed, and will be repeatedly sketched and described by literary historians. Especially outstanding literary works and important literary trends will almost permanently obtain historical resonance as the literary history mountain range extends indefinitely. This historical resonance is often very complex: sometimes it harmonizes with the rhythm of literary development in this era and may be enthusiastically praised by literary historians; sometimes it may become a discordant note in the rhythm of literary development in this era and be criticized and despised by literary historians; and in another period, there may be two or more conflicting views coexisting, drawing caricatures of a work or a trend with different faces. The "May Fourth" New Literature Movement itself was only about a decade long, but its significance, influence, and the images of writers active in the literary world at that time have always been in the process of being redrawn. Studying the "May Fourth" literature from the late Qing literary turmoil and contemporary social conditions to understand its causes and innovative significance is indeed very important; but studying the rotation of viewpoints and changes in opinions in the research on "May Fourth" literature over more than half a century is also very meaningful. Because it not only accumulates various conflicting views on "May Fourth" literature, which can inspire and deepen our understanding of "May Fourth" literature; it can also make us reflect on the research on "May Fourth" literature itself, taking the limitations and mistakes of past researchers as a lesson, finding new starting points and footholds for research.

Reverse research in literary history is the process of examining how literature of each era illuminates history with its contemporary light. This "illumination of history" is actually the process of injecting new blood into history, making it come back to life and join the creation of contemporary literature.

By examining the significance and value of previous literature from the developed later literature, on the one hand, it can fully reveal the hidden or budding factors in previous literature; on the other hand, it is the process of illuminating previous literature with the contemporary light of one's own era, making historical traditions gain contemporary significance. In our past literary concepts, we always thought that once a literary work appeared in history, it became an objective existence. The main task of literary history research was to objectively explain its original meaning and clearly sort out its teacher-student and change relationships in literary history. In fact, no matter how much the researcher claims to be "objective" and to "restore the original appearance of things," it is actually impossible to do so. Because the researcher always stands on the ground of his own era to deal with past literature, always bringing the enlightenment of reality and today's understanding to different degrees of reconstruction of past literature. This point is particularly evident in reverse research in literary history.

Reverse research is different from forward research. It does not just place the research object within a "certain historical range," that is, trying to immerse oneself in the past years to experience and grasp past literature; but rather, it consciously places the research object outside a "certain historical range," consciously examining past literature from the developed later literature. Therefore, it is more evident that it illuminates historical literature with contemporary light. On the surface, reverse research in literary history seems to be studying traditional literature, but in reality, it is injecting contemporary blood into traditional literature, making it come back to life and join the creation of contemporary literature. In the new era, when literature borrowed Western modernist techniques for artistic exploration and innovation, it also faced various criticisms and accusations. At this time, many researchers almost unanimously "discovered" many signs and characteristics of modernist literature in traditional poetry and ancient novels: such as American and British imagist poetry is actually a transplanted classical Chinese poetry, and the "symbolic metaphor" and "image stacking" techniques it often talks about are just everyday practices in Chinese classical poetry. In ancient novels, the method of blending dreams and reality, and the contrast between the human world and mythology, is full of characteristics of stream-of-consciousness and magical realism... Who can say that this kind of research is just an analysis and grasp of the characteristics of past literature? Isn't it participating in the creation of contemporary literature?

Precisely because of this, reverse research in literary history is not just a dead study of old papers, nor is it just following the development of past literature and simply recording and describing past literature. It is, like literary creation and literary criticism, also a creative and dynamic study with the significance of promoting the development of contemporary literature. Because reverse research, through consciously illuminating the past with contemporary light, not only brings new meanings and new appearances to past works and traditions, but also intervenes in and participates in the development and creation of contemporary literature. In this way, past literature and contemporary literature are not just a "diachronic" linear structure from the past to the present, as we usually think, but a unified whole of "synchronic" coexistence of the past and the present. I believe that the evolution and development of literature is not a unidirectional extension from ancient times to the present, but a process of mutual penetration, interfusion, and synchronous progression of ancient and modern literature, forming a whole. In this process, tradition influences reality, reality changes tradition, the changed tradition has reality, and the reality influenced by tradition enhances its historical sense. Their cyclic progressive movement is the dynamic structure of literary development.

　　文学史的逆向研究
    钱念孙
    我们的文学史建设，除了须进行拨乱反正的“重写”外，还应注重对文学史整体框架和研究方法的新探索。文学史的逆向研究，便是可尝试探索的途径之一。
    新时期文学创作和文学观念的疾速演进，使人们得以用新的眼光来重新审视整个中国古代和现当代文学史。于是，“重写文学史”的呼声越来越高，不少论者撰写翻案文章，对以往文学史中已有“公论”、“定评”的作家作品及思潮流派，进行重新评价，给其以今天看来更加合理的历史位置。这对纠正产生于极“左”年代的文学史的偏颇和谬误，无疑极有意义和价值。不过，我们的文学史建设却不应满足于此，它除了应从内容和形式上对５０年代以来的文学史研究进行“重写”外，还应包括对文学史的整体框架和研究方法进行新的探索。文学史的逆向研究，便是这种新探索可尝试的途径之一。
    每一文学现象都处在历史的纵向联系之中。以任一文学现象为视点，这种纵向联系都可以从顺向和逆向两个方面加以研究。顺向研究是按照文学历史发展顺序进行的研究，主要把握该文学与既往文学的联系，寻求该文学的渊源、传统、起因及历史由来等问题。逆向研究是从文学历史发展顺序的相反方向来进行研究，它主要把握该文学与后代文学的关系，即从该文学的流变、影响、结果及历史命运来认识其意义和价值。在文学史的研究中，不仅需要从既往文学里了解其“前因”，还要反过来从后代文学里考察其“后果”，并在两者或矛盾或统一的复杂历史变化中透视该现象。
    然而，古往今来的文学史著作，绝大多数只是按照研究后代文学应从前代文学着手的惯例，循着顺向研究的路数来编著文学史，考察文学现象。对于逆向研究，尽管不少视域宽阔的研究者不同程度地总要涉猎一些，如人们常常会依据新时代的审美意识来重新评价过去的作家作品，常常会从某些活跃在后代文学中的传统因素来重新理解历史遗产的意义等；但感到不足的是，这些多半只停留在经验性的直观把握上（虽然这也是非常可贵的），几乎都没有把逆向研究作为文学史研究的一种重要方法，予以足够重视和自觉运用。
    实际上，随着文学历史的发展及其丰富性的充分展开，随着人们对文学的认识逐步全面和不断深化（如符号学、阐释学、接受美学对文学过程作出的新探讨等），已越来越证实：不论某一作家作品或某种思潮流派，它的意义和价值多半不能在其当代显露无遗，而只能在以后的历史发展中逐渐呈现出来。要深刻认识已逝去的文学历史，却不能不在进行顺向研究，即从先前文学传统和当时状况把握其兴衰缘由的同时，还要“倒过来”从后代发展了的文学中，发现前代文学潜藏的或由特定历史条件遮蔽了的特质。因为当代文学中蕴含的属于未来的新因素，只有在后代文学里才能得到萌发生长；前代文学中隐伏的不利文学发展的病灶，也只能在后代文学里才会充分暴露出来。
  　文学史的逆向研究，还包括对文学史自身的逆向考察，通过研究不同时代文学史对文学过程的不同认识，可以从另一角度把握人们审美观念的演变轨迹。
    一部真正文学作品的诞生或一个重要文学思潮流派的出现，一般都会引起后代文学史家的反复描述和反复评价。由于不同时代具有不同的审美倾向，不同的文学史家具有不同的学术个性，同一文学现象在不同的文学史论著中，常常会呈现出不同的面貌，有时甚至会出现评价截然相反的情况。这就是过去的文学史虽然早已有人撰写，但每个新时代都必然要以自己的眼光对它重写一番的内在缘由。而通过考察不同时代文学史对同一文学现象的不同评述，不仅可以更加立体、丰富地认识研究对象，而且可以从另一角度，即从不同时代对同一作品的评述差异中，发现和把握人们审美观念变迁的历史脉络。
    举例来说，陶渊明在中国文学史上，无疑属于艺术造诣极高的大作家，但在他生活的当时及以后相当长的一段时间里，这一点却根本不为文学史家所承认、所重视。刘勰《文心雕龙·体性》篇列举和称誉了从汉到晋的杰出作家１２人，有贾谊、司马相如、扬雄、刘向、班固、张衡、王?、刘桢、阮籍、嵇康、潘岳、陆机等，只字不提陶渊明。钟嵘《诗品》专评汉魏至南朝的五言诗，其置为“上品”的诗人一大群，陶渊明同样被排除在外。其他当时及以后一段时间论述文学的重要论著，如沈约的《宋书·谢灵运传论》、裴子野的《雕虫论》、肖子显的《南齐书·文学传论》等，对陶渊明的态度也基本和刘勰、钟嵘一致。可见，由晋至南北朝的数百年间，文学史家对陶渊明的成就均认识很不足。唐代古文运动兴起后，陶诗身价日高，中经李白、杜甫，尤其是苏轼的极力推崇，陶渊明才确立了伟大诗人的地位。从后代推崇陶渊明反观前代冷落陶渊明，并对其推崇和冷落的原因进行探讨，不是既可加深我们对陶诗特点的认识，又可从批评接受的角度把握文学审美观念的演变历程么？以陶渊明一人为例浅尝可如此，将历代文学史对各种重要文学现象的论评进行综合的逆向考察，当会有更大的收获。
    文学史的逆向研究是多层次的。任何文学现象在历史上一旦出现，便会在以后的文学长河里忽隐忽显地持续发生作用，便会被文学史家不断地勾勒描绘。尤其是杰出的文学作品和重要的文学潮流，几乎会随着文学史山脉的无限延长而永久地得到历史回响。这种历史回响常常是很复杂的：有时与此一时代文学发展的旋律和谐合拍，可能被文学史家热切颂扬；有时则可能成为被一时代文学发展旋律中的不协和音调，遭到文学史家厌弃指摘；而另一时期又可能两种或多种歧异对立的见解同时并存，给某一作品或某一思潮画出面目各异的漫画像。“五四”新文学运动本身不过短短的十来年光景，但它的意义、作用及活跃于当时文坛的作家形象，却始终在被重新描画之中。研究“五四”文学，从晚清文坛骚动和当时社会状况考察其兴起原因和革新意义，固然十分重要；但对半个多世纪来人们研究“五四”文学的视点旋转和观点变幻本身进行探讨，照样也很有意义。因为其中不仅积淀着对“五四”文学各种矛盾对立的见解，可以启发和加深我们对“五四”文学的认识；而且更可以使我们对“五四”文学研究自身进行反思，将以往研究者的局限和失误作为前车之鉴，找到研究的新的出发点和落脚点。
    文学史的逆向研究，是考察各个时代文学如何以自己的当代光芒照亮历史的过程。这种“照亮历史”，实际上是给历史输入当代的新鲜血液，使它起死回生，加入到当代文学的创造之中。
    从后代发展了的文学倒过来考察前代文学的意义和价值，一方面可以把前代文学中潜藏的或处于萌芽状态的因素，充分揭示出来；另方面则是以自己时代的当代光芒照亮前代文学，使历史传统获得当代意义的过程。在我们以往的文学观念里，总以为历史上的文学作品一经问世，便是一种客观存在，文学史研究的主要任务，就是客观地阐述它的本来意义，梳理清楚它在文学历史中的师承、流变关系。其实，不管研究者声称如何“客观”，如何“还事物本来面貌”，事实上却无法做到。因为研究者总是站在自己时代的大地上来处理以往文学，总是要带着现实的启示和今天的理解来对以往文学进行不同程度的重新塑造。这一点，在文学史的逆向研究中，表现尤为明显。
    逆向研究和顺向研究不同，它并非仅把研究对象放在“一定历史范围之内”，即尽量沉浸到过去年代里去设身处地体验和把握以往文学；而是有意识地把研究对象放到“一定历史范围”之外，自觉地从后代发展了的文学来反观既往文学，所以它用当代光芒照亮历史文学的成分更为明显。文学史的逆向研究，表面上看来是在研究传统文学，实际上是给传统文学注入当代血液，使它起死回生，加入到当代文学的创造之中。新时期文学借鉴西方现代派的表现手法进行艺术探索和艺术创新、却又招致种种非议和责难时，不少研究者几乎不约而同地从传统诗歌和古代小说里“发现”了许多现代派文学的征兆和特质：如英美意象派诗歌实际上是我国古典诗词的易地栽种，其所津津乐道的“象征隐喻”和“意象叠加”等手法，在我国古典诗词里不过是家常便饭，古典小说中，梦幻与现实交融，人间与神话映衬的写法，更是不乏意识流及魔幻现实主义的特色了……。谁能说这类研究仅仅是对以往文学特点的剖析和把握呢？难道它们不是在参与当代文学的创造吗？
    正是如此，文学史的逆向研究并非只是在故纸堆里打滚的死学问，也并不仅仅是跟在既往文学发展后面的学步邯郸，只是如实地记录、描述既往文学；而是和文学创作、文学批评一样，也具有推动当代文学发展的创造学和动力学的意义。因为逆向研究通过自觉地用当代光芒照亮过去历史，不但给过去的作品和传统带来了新的含义和新的面目，同时又介入、参与了当代文学的发展和创造。这样，既往文学和当代文学之间，就不像我们通常所认为的那样，仅仅是一个从过去到现在的“历时性”的线型结构，而是过去与现在同在的“共时性”的统一整体。我以为，文学的演进和发展，并不是从古到今的单向延伸运动，而是古今文学彼此渗透，相互交融，联成整体，共时推进的过程。在这过程中，传统影响着现实，现实改变着传统，改变了的传统具备了现实性，受传统影响的现实增强了历史感，它们的循环渐进运动，正是文学发展的动态结构。
