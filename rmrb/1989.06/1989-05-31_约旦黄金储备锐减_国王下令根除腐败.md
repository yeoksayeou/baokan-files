Jordan's gold reserves have sharply declined. King Hussein has ordered the eradication of corruption.

BEIJING, May 30 (Xinhua) -- Jordan's Central Bank Governor Muhammad Said Nabulushi said in an interview with television reporters last night that Jordan's gold reserves have significantly decreased in recent times. The country's gold reserves have dropped from 1 million ounces to 740,000 ounces, and part of this has been exchanged for foreign currency. Therefore, Jordan's current gold reserves are only one-third of the original amount.

Since Jordan announced its political and economic separation from the West Bank in July last year, the country's foreign exchange reserves have rapidly declined, and the economic situation has severely deteriorated. The government has adopted economic austerity measures.

According to a cabinet official, the Shukair government's white paper on the economic crisis in Jordan since 1988 will disclose some figures and situations.

　　约旦黄金储备锐减
    国王下令根除腐败
    本报大马士革５月３０日电  记者吴文斌报道：约旦中央银行行长穆罕默德·赛义德·纳布露希昨晚在对电视记者发表谈话时指出，约旦的黄金储备最近一个时期大幅度下降，国家黄金储备已从１００万盎司下降到７４万盎司，接着又将其中的一部分兑换成了外汇，因此，目前约旦的黄金储备只剩下原有储备的１／３。
    自去年７月约旦宣布与约旦河西岸脱离政治和经济关系之后，国库外汇储备急剧下降，经济形势严重恶化，政府采取了经济紧缩措施。
    据一位内阁官员说：沙克尔政府制定的关于１９８８年以来约旦经济危机形势的白皮书，将公布一些数字和情况。
