Film critics from both sides of the Taiwan Strait gathered in Xiamen to discuss Taiwanese film and television art. The seminar, which concluded on May 30, was the first such gathering of film critics from both sides in 40 years.

More than 20 film critics from Taiwan and Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, Fuzhou, and Xiamen began their discussions on May 27. They focused on the historical context, themes, and artistic styles of Taiwan's new cinema, women's cinema, and martial arts cinema from the 1980s. They also compared and analyzed the film art and language of mainland China and Taiwan.

The participants agreed that Taiwanese film and television art, as part of Chinese culture, has developed its own unique characteristics and made contributions to Chinese culture.
