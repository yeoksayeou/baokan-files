Fujian Leaders Visit Foreign Employees of Foreign-Invested Enterprises

FUZHOU, June 15 (Xinhua) — Leaders from Fujian Province and Fuzhou City today visited several foreign-invested enterprises in Fuzhou to meet with foreign employees. They expressed gratitude for the foreign employees' decision to stay at their posts during the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing.

The foreign managers and technicians of several enterprises said that during the past period, their family members called several times a day urging them to return home. However, they felt that the situation in Fuzhou was stable, the enterprises were operating normally, and the society was safe and secure, so there was no need to leave.

Chen Guangyi, Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee, and Wang Zhaoguo, Governor of Fujian Province, said that Fujian is an experimental zone for reform and opening up. The central government's policies on reform and opening up remain unchanged, and they asked everyone to rest assured.

Provincial and municipal leaders also listened to some of the difficulties faced by foreign-invested enterprises and proposed solutions on the spot. For issues that could not be resolved immediately, they promised to discuss and resolve them promptly upon return.

Guangdong's Reform and Opening-Up Momentum Has Not Weakened

GUANGZHOU, June 15 (Xinhua) — Recently, the Guangzhou Economic and Technological Development Zone held a meeting with representatives of some joint ventures. Lin Ruo, Secretary of the Guangdong Provincial Party Committee, praised the foreign businesspeople for staying focused on production and operations despite external influences.

This year, the momentum of reform and opening up in Guangzhou has not slowed down. In the first five months of this year, the city signed 707 contracts with foreign businesses, totaling nearly $270 million in investment. The actual investment has already reached $140 million, equivalent to the total for the entire previous year.
