The vast sea shimmers with a myriad of waves. A white sail glides gently across.

Suddenly, amidst the boundless blue, clusters of green treetops emerge, swaying gently with the waves. Amidst the roar of the tides, a forest rises from the sea.

This is the red mangrove forest. Some call it the "pioneer of land creation," others the "guardian of the coast." The tallest can reach over ten meters, some as thick as a person's embrace, standing firmly on the coastal mudflats. The average ones are about two to three meters tall, as wide as a bowl or a wine cup—year after year, with the tides, they are submerged in the green waves, and only revealed when the tide recedes… Layer upon layer, patch upon patch, their roots intertwine, stretching for dozens of kilometers along the winding coastline, like a massive green wreath.

This is China's largest and most diverse red mangrove forest reserve, located near Dongzhaigang in the northeast of Hainan Province. Legend has it that this was once a fertile land. People tilled the fragrant soil, leaving deep footprints… But now, all of that seems like a dream—nearly four hundred years ago, on a midnight, a volcanic eruption shook the earth and sky, causing nearly three hundred villages to gradually sink into the sea. Later, on this watery expanse, a red mangrove forest covering about six thousand acres gradually appeared. To this day, beneath the cool sea water of the forest, there are still remnants of ancient walls, stages, wells, temples, tombs, and winding village paths, with fields and furrows still visible…

Hainan's red mangrove forest is famous worldwide for its contributions to the arduous revolutionary struggle in Qiongya—many revolutionary veterans speak of the red mangrove forest with reverence, their voices trembling with emotion, revealing deep affection…

I once visited a nearly 70-year-old veteran of the "Qiongzhong" forces. That day, he personally took us, rowing a small boat, gently into the forest. The green leaves layered upon each other, low and close to the water's surface, covering the sea in a fresh green hue; countless sprouts hung like swords above the waves; countless steel-like roots intertwined, weaving a dense net… We had to constantly lean against the boat, bend over, and crawl through this green corridor.

The boat turned a bend, startling three herons into the blue sky. Instantly, the surrounding area was filled with the sound of birds taking flight, turning the red forest's sky into a flurry of gray and white, chirping and cawing loudly.

The small boat slowly drifted deeper into the red forest. The branches were lush, and a cool fragrance wafted through the air. Suddenly, a white sandbank appeared in the vast sea—this was where our army was forced to retreat, enduring the most difficult times. “So many good comrades sacrificed their lives,” the old man reminisced deeply, “That time, the signalman, Little Chen, was on lookout for me. A shell exploded next to him, and he fell from the mangrove into the sea, the roots supporting him… He was seriously injured, crying out in pain, but there were no doctors or medicine, nothing we could do… His last words were, ‘It hurts, it hurts so much.’ He was only fifteen that year.”

“The quartermaster, Old Yang, starved to death. At that time, we ate raw tree seeds, swallowing them hard… That day, he spat out seed after seed that he couldn’t digest, gave a bitter smile, and said, ‘Brother, I’m leaving, I’m leaving… Victory, I can’t wait to see it…’”

The old man's tears flowed freely, and my heart ached.

Back then, there were a row of small thatched houses on the sandbank, but after many years, the dilapidated huts had long disappeared, leaving only some slender grass and creeping vines, with fluffy, vibrant yellow flowers trembling gently, evoking countless thoughts.

We silently returned to the boat, quietly listening to the forest's roar and the sea's laughter, letting the small boat drift with the current.

A breeze blew, and the water against the boat's side splashed; then came a rustling sound—these were the sounds of young mangrove seedlings, nurtured in the mother tree, now falling into the water one by one—this was the final farewell, followed by a reluctant parting. Some would drift with the waves for months, settling in foreign lands to continue their growth, becoming a new forest on the sea…

The sunset was brilliant, the setting sun golden. I stood alone by the sea. The sea breeze blew, bringing back a sail; in the distance, smoke curled up, and the sound of livestock could be heard. The red forest gradually disappeared; the sea and sky became tranquil; the silver beach was like a gently plucked string. Young students from Hong Kong and Macau, who came to travel and camp by the sea, set up tents on the beach, lit a bonfire, and roasted seafood. I couldn’t hear them talking, and their laughter was so faint, only the sound of the guitar floating in the sea and sky.

Do they know the past of this peaceful land beneath their feet?

Behind the red mangrove forest, far away on the flat shore, the sound of pile-driving machines clanged sharply.

　　梦绕魂牵红树林
    潘毅敏
    大海茫茫，一片潋艳波光。白帆轻轻滑过。
    突然，在万顷碧波之上，渐渐露出丛丛翠绿的树冠，随着波浪微微荡漾。隆隆的海潮声中，海面浮升起一片森林。
    这就是红树林。有人誉它“造陆先锋”，有人称它“海岸卫士”，它最高的十多米，有的合抱粗，屹立在海岸滩涂；一般的二三米，碗口样或酒盅般大小——年年岁岁，涨潮了，它们便淹在碧波里，退潮后，它们才露出来……它们一层层，一片片，盘根错节，纵横交织，浩浩荡荡，绵延数十公里，深深地固定在弯弯曲曲的海岸线上，有如巨大的绿色花环。
    这里就是我国品种最齐全最大的红树林保护区，在海南省东北部的东寨港附近。相传，这里曾是一片生生热土。人们曾在这块充满芬芳的土地上幸福耕耘，留下深深的足迹……可如今，这一切都像梦一样消失了——近四百年前的一天深夜，一场动地惊天的火山群大爆发，使近三百座村庄渐渐沉入大海汪洋之中……以后，在这片水乡泽国上，逐渐出现了总面积约六万亩的红树林。至今，在森林下冰凉的海水中，还遗留着断壁残垣、古戏台、古水井、古庙宇、古坟茔，羊肠般曲曲弯弯的村道，阡陌纵横垄沟依旧的耕田……
    海南的红树林首先是因为对琼崖艰苦的革命斗争作出贡献而天下闻名的——多少革命老人每每说到红树林，都肃然起敬，止不住阵阵激动，流露出一片深情……
    我曾拜访了一位年近７０的“琼纵”老战士，那天，他亲自带着我们，划着小舢板，悠悠地向林中荡去。绿叶层层，低低地附依着水面，将海水掩映得一片清嫩；一条条一串串胚芽，剑一般垂挂在碧波之上；万千层钢索般缠绕绞合着的根柱，织就一张张密密的网……我们不得不时时贴着船舷，拱背弯腰，从这绿色的回廊中钻过。
    船到弯处，惊动三只苍鹭，冲上蓝天。顿时，周围远近一片??腾空飞跃，红林上空转眼间一片灰白，吱吱嘎嘎好生热闹。
    小船儿慢慢滑到红林深处。枝叶扶疏，清香拂面，苍海中攸然浮出一片白色的沙洲——当年，我军被迫转移到这儿，度过了最艰难的岁月。”“多少好同志，都牺牲了”，老人陷入深深的怀念，“那次，司号员小陈替我瞭望，一颗炮弹在他身旁炸开，他从红树上滚下海，气根托住了他……他伤很重，一声声地叫，可无医无药，没法子……临死前他最后一句话是‘好痛，我好痛哇’那年他十五。”
    “庶务长老羊是活活饿死的。那时天天吃生树籽，硬吞……那天，他吐出一粒粒没能消化的红树籽，惨惨一笑，说‘兄弟，我走啦、走啦……胜利，我等不及了……’”
    老人老泪纵横，我心里也酸酸地难受。
    当年，沙洲上有一溜小草房，可年深月久，那破漏的棚寮早已荡然无存，只长着些萋萋小草和蔓蔓藤萝，开着毛绒绒鲜艳艳的小黄花，在瑟瑟地抖动着，令人思绪悠悠。
    我们默默回到舢板上，静静地听着林涛在轻啸海浪在欢笑，任凭小船儿顺水漂摇。
    一阵风吹来，船舷水波哗哗响；又听见一阵?啦啦响——那是在母胎上孕育成熟，现纷纷脱离母体的小红树苗的轻轻落水声——这是最后的一声告别，之后便是依依不舍的分离，它们有些将随波逐浪数月漂流，在他乡异地，继续繁衍生息，长成一片新的海上森林……
    晚霞璀璨，落日溶金，我独自来到海边。海风呼呼，送来归帆一片；远处炊烟袅袅，传来家畜的叫声，红林渐渐隐去；海天趋于宁静；银滩像一张悠悠轻弹的琴。前来旅游露宿的港澳青年学生在海边搭起帐篷，燃起篝火，烧烤着海味，听不到他们说话，连开怀的笑声也那么缥渺，只有吉它琴声在海天中飞扬。
    他们可知道脚下这片安宁的土地的昨天？
    红树林后面远远的那排平岸，遥遥传来打桩机铿锵的锤音。
