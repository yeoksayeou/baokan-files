    Since last winter and this spring, over 100 deer have been brutally hunted in the Baiyin Aobao Nature Reserve and Huanggang Ridge Forest Area in the northern part of Keshiketeng Banner, Chifeng City, Inner Mongolia.

    The Baiyin Aobao Nature Reserve and Huanggang Ridge Forest Area are located at the southern foot of the Greater Khingan Mountains, covering a total area of 260,000 hectares. The area is densely forested with more than 20 species of trees, including red pine, larch, and Korean pine, creating a lush and verdant landscape. The vast forest is home to tigers, leopards, musk deer, and roe deer, among 30 different species of wildlife. The most abundant of these are the sika deer, a second-class protected animal in China.

    Since last winter and this spring, people from Liaoning, Hebei, and the local area have flocked to the forest, competing to hunt sika deer. Some use rifles, others use axes, and some use lasso poles and snares. At the peak of the hunting season, there were up to a thousand people in the forest each day. Farmer Sun Ruifang from Tianheshui Township, along with six others from Xifeng County, Liaoning Province—including You Shuwu and Zhao Jun—formed a gang. They captured 14 sika deer using snares. They mutilated the live deer, cutting off their antlers, smashing their horns, and slicing off their penises in a gruesome display. According to investigations by relevant departments, more than 100 sika deer have been killed. Due to the indiscriminate hunting, the once abundant sika deer have almost disappeared from the area.

    The case is currently under investigation.

　　小鹿何辜　竟遭屠杀
    克什克腾旗百只珍兽遇害
    本报讯  去冬今春以来，内蒙古赤峰市克什克腾旗北部的白音敖包自然保护区和黄岗梁林区的１００多只马鹿惨遭捕杀。
    白音敖包自然保护区和黄岗梁林区地处大兴安岭南麓，总面积２６万公顷，生长着茂密的红皮云杉、落叶松、红松等２０多个树种，林木葱茏，遮天蔽日。浩瀚的林海中栖息着虎豹、獐、狍等，在３０多种野生动物中，以国家二类保护动物马鹿为最多。
    去冬今春以来，辽宁、河北以及当地一些人云集林区，竞相捕杀马鹿。他们有的用猎枪打，有的用斧头砍，有的用套马杆、套子套，高峰时，每天人数达上千人。天合源乡农民孙瑞芳，勾结辽宁省西丰县农民由树文、赵军等６人结成团伙，先后套捕马鹿１４只。他们对捉到的活鹿，割鹿茸，砸鹿角，剪鹿鞭，生割活剥之状令人惨不忍睹。据有关部门的调查，遭到捕杀的马鹿有１００只以上。由于这些人乱捕滥杀，过去成群结队的马鹿几乎消声匿迹了。
　　目前，此案正在审理中。　　　　　　　　（王国文　李凯峰）
