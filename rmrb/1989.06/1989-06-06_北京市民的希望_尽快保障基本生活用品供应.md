In recent days, Beijing has experienced traffic congestion and shortages of basic living necessities, which have caused great concern among residents. They hope that the municipal government will take immediate measures to restore traffic and ensure the supply of basic living necessities for residents.

Today, reporters visited some streets and found that many shops were closed, and the number of vegetable vendors in the markets had significantly decreased compared to usual. In the few stores that were open, such as grain shops and vegetable stalls, residents formed long queues. The sales of items suitable for storage, such as canned goods, biscuits, grains, and oils, surged.

At around 1 PM, a truck carrying fresh milk arrived at the Xiaozhuang grocery store. Before the milk was unloaded, it was all sold out. A young man who managed to buy 10 bags of fresh milk said that his child was almost out of milk. He had to share this milk with several families in the building, and some were preparing to send their children to relatives in other cities.

According to the Beijing Television Evening News, many residents called the station to complain about not being able to exchange liquid gas. Residents hope that the municipal government will take immediate measures to ensure the supply of basic living necessities and alleviate their concerns.
