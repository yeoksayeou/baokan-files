Mauritanian government officials have expressed their hope for stability in China. The officials stated that Mauritania is pleased with the Chinese government's suppression of a counter-revolutionary rebellion and hopes for stability in China's political situation.

Member of the Mauritanian Salvation Military Committee and Minister of Health and Social Affairs, Ndiaye Kane, made these remarks during a meeting with the Chinese Ambassador to Mauritania, Liu Bai. Kane said that his country would stand with China and support the Chinese government. The Mauritanian government has been closely following recent events in China with concern, primarily fearing the possibility of anarchy and obstacles to economic development. He expressed his belief that China would continue to progress.

Previously, members of the Mauritanian Salvation Military Committee, including Minister of Equipment Diyeg Omar Harouna and Minister of Information Mustafa Ould Abdallah, also met with Ambassador Liu Bai. They stated that from President Taya down to ordinary citizens, Mauritania hopes for stability in China. They also expressed skepticism towards Western media reports on the situation in China, believing that the Chinese government and people would find their own solutions to their problems and achieve their goals.

    希望中国政局稳定
    新华社努瓦克肖特６月１７日电  毛里塔尼亚救国军事委员会成员、卫生和社会事务部长恩迪亚耶·卡内今天在这里说，毛里塔尼亚对中国政府平息了一场反革命暴乱表示高兴，并希望中国政局稳定。
    卡内部长是在接见中国驻毛里塔尼亚大使柳白时作出上述表示的。他说，他的国家将站在中国一边，支持中国政府。毛政府对中国最近发生的事件既关注又担心。主要是担心中国出现无政府状态，经济发展受到阻碍。他相信中国能够不断进步。在此之前，毛救国军委会成员、装备部长迪耶格·奥马尔·哈罗纳和新闻部长穆斯塔法·乌尔德·阿贝达拉赫曼在会见柳白大使时也表示，毛里塔尼亚从国家元首塔亚主席到普通公民都希望中国稳定。他们还表示不大相信西方新闻媒介对中国局势的报道，并相信中国政府和人民能够找到解决自己问题的方法，实现自己的奋斗目标。
