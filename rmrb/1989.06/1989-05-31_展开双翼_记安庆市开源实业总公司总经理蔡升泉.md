	Spreading Wings
	— A Profile of Cai Shengquan, General Manager of Anqing City Kaiyuan Industrial Corporation
	Bian Wen

	“People are not born to carry chains, but to spread their wings; there should be no crawling humans. I want to transform from a caterpillar into a butterfly, from an earthworm into a living flower, and to fly.”
	Cai Shengquan appreciates this quote from Victor Hugo. When talking about the establishment of Anqing City Kaiyuan Industrial Corporation, he first quoted this passage.

	People should “spread their wings.” Cai Shengquan is a person who has indeed spread his wings.

	In 1979, at the age of 40, Cai Shengquan was serving as the deputy director of the Anqing City Education Bureau. Suddenly, he gave up his official position and started a business. He led eight unemployed youth and retired workers to open Kaiyuan Store. Starting with selling garlic and pears, he gradually accumulated capital. Now, Kaiyuan Store has developed into Anqing City Kaiyuan Industrial Corporation. It is a comprehensive enterprise group integrating commerce, service industry, industry, foreign trade, real estate, and forestry. Not to mention other aspects, just talking about Kaiyuan's industry, there are eight factories including clothing, food, automobile repair, furniture, and paper box packaging. The path of Kaiyuan becomes wider and wider, and Cai Shengquan has become an entrepreneur.

	Cai Shengquan chose to run a business instead of pursuing an official career because he felt he was suited for commerce. The vast market is the ideal place for him to spread his wings and fly freely.

	One winter, cotton-padded jackets were in high demand. He went to Shanghai to find supplies. The suppliers said they would only provide goods upon payment. However, Kaiyuan Store couldn't come up with the money at the time. Cai Shengquan requested credit sales, pleading earnestly. When all else failed, Cai Shengquan took out his work ID and suggested: “I’ll stay in Shanghai as a hostage, and you can provide the goods on credit.” The suppliers agreed. Cai Shengquan stayed there as a “pledge,” and the store sent someone to pick up the goods every day. It was through this method that Kaiyuan Store sold 50,000 cotton-padded jackets.

	Kaiyuan Store changed the official business style, extending operating hours to 10 PM, and to 12 AM during the Spring Festival. Kaiyuan Store utilized its outlets in other cities to introduce the latest fashionable goods to Anqing, earning it the nickname “Little Shanghai” and “Little Hong Kong” among consumers.

	Cai Shengquan is good at seizing opportunities and continuously expanding the scale of the enterprise. Real estate is a new industry. In 1986, Cai Shengquan established a real estate development company, and in 1987, it completed more than 10,000 square meters of commercial housing.

	Cai Shengquan wants to turn Kaiyuan Corporation into a new type of enterprise different from the traditional system. In 1981, Kaiyuan Corporation stipulated that it would not follow the management and distribution systems of state-owned and collective enterprises, but instead implement new methods. In terms of management, the manager has full authority, and subordinate units are responsible to the company, operating independently with separate accounting and separate dining. In terms of employee income distribution, there is no equal pay for all, but a floating wage system. In 1985, Kaiyuan Corporation also implemented a shareholding system, with corporate shares as the mainstay and individual shares as a supplement.

	“Kaiyuan” is thriving, but Cai Shengquan also has many worries. For example, some people are not confident in Kaiyuan's shareholding system, feeling that it is not as reliable as “public ownership” or “large collectives.” Some employees have even left the company because of this. However, Cai Shengquan's determination is firm, and he will continue to walk the path of reform.

　　展开双翼
    ——记安庆市开源实业总公司总经理蔡升泉
    边文
    “人生下来不是为了抱着锁链，而是为了展开双翼；不要再有爬行的人类。我要幼虫化为蝴蝶，我要蚯蚓变成活的花朵，而且飞舞起来。”
    蔡升泉很欣赏雨果的这段名言。说起创办安庆市开源实业总公司的历程，他先引用了这段话。
    人应该“展开双翼”。蔡升泉就是“展开双翼”的人。
    １９７９年，４０岁的蔡升泉正当着安庆市教育局的副局长，忽然不做“官”经起商来。他领着８个待业青年、退休工人办起了开源商店。靠卖大蒜、卖梨起家，逐渐积累了资金，如今开源商店已发展成安庆市开源实业总公司。它是一家集商业、服务业、工业、外贸、房地产、林业等行业为一体的综合性企业集团。不说别的，就说开源的工业吧，有服装、食品、汽车维修、家具、纸箱包装等８个工厂。开源之路越走越宽，蔡升泉也成了企业家。
    蔡升泉不奔仕途办企业，因为他觉得自己是经商的料，广阔的市场正是他展开双翼自由飞翔的好地方。
    有一年冬天，棉袄罩衫好销。他跑到上海寻找货源。人家说一手交钱一手交货，可开源商店一时又拿不出这笔钱来。蔡升泉请求赊销，好话说尽，实在无奈，蔡升泉拿出了自己的工作证，给对方出了个主意：我留在上海做人质，你们把货先赊给我们。对方同意了。蔡升泉就“抵押”在那里，商店里的人一天一趟来取货。就是靠这种办法，开源商店共销出了５万件棉袄罩衫。
    开源商店改变了官商作风，营业时间延长到晚上１０点，春节期间延长到１２点。开源商店利用在外地的窗口，把最时兴的货物及时引进安庆，被消费者称为安庆的小上海、小香港。
    蔡升泉善于抓住机会，不断扩大企业规模。房地产是新兴的产业。１９８６年蔡升泉开办了房地产开发公司，１９８７年就完成了一万多平方米的商品房。
    蔡升泉要把开源公司办成一个不同于传统体制的新型企业。１９８１年，开源公司就规定，不沿袭国营企业、集体企业的管理分配等制度，实行新的办法。在经营管理上，经理全权负责，下属单位对公司承包，独立核算、分灶吃饭；职工收入分配上，不吃大锅饭，实行浮动工资。１９８５年，开源公司又实行了股份制，以企业股为主，个人股为辅。
    “开源”兴旺发达，但是蔡升泉也有不少苦恼。比如说，有人对开源的股份制不放心，总觉得不如“全民”、“大集体”可靠，有的职工还因此离开了公司，不过，蔡升泉的信心是坚定的，他要在改革的路上继续走下去。
