Tianjin Mayor Li Ruihuan met with representatives of foreign-funded enterprises in Tianjin yesterday afternoon and emphasized: The overall policy of reform and opening up, personally formulated by Deng Xiaoping, will not change. Reform and opening up not only need to be maintained but will also be increasingly improved.

Li Ruihuan first introduced the recent situation in Tianjin. He said, as the mayor of Tianjin, my central task in this period is to prevent turmoil, stabilize Tianjin, and prevent the people from suffering from turmoil. He said that in recent days, some foreign and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan friends have temporarily left Tianjin, which is understandable. He believes that one day they will return. Li Ruihuan said that under these circumstances, many foreign friends have stayed in Tianjin, showing us full understanding and trust. The vice-chairman of the British 48 Group sent a telegram expressing a desire to strengthen friendship and cooperation with Tianjin; some Hong Kong enterprises and companies sent telegrams expressing a willingness to lend money to Tianjin; Mr. Akira Yamazumi, advisor to the Japan-China Petroleum Development Corporation, sent a telegram of condolence and greetings. This company's staff in Tianjin did not withdraw anyone.

Li Ruihuan said, I can assert that China's policy of reform and opening up will not change. Solving China's major and fundamental problems all depend on reform and opening up. Denying reform and opening up is equivalent to denying the history created by the Chinese people in the past ten years, which goes against the wishes and interests of the vast majority. Reform and opening up are not only economic issues but also political issues. The degree of democracy and freedom cannot be separated from the economic base and the level of civilization and culture, while the development of economic construction and the improvement of civilization and culture all depend on further reform and opening up.

Li Ruihuan said that after suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, we need to think calmly about the issues, study and correct some of the mistakes in our work, better play to our advantages, and make reform and opening up better.

The foreign and Hong Kong, Macao, and Taiwan businesspeople present applauded Li Ruihuan's speech enthusiastically, and some spoke.

　　李瑞环与在津三资企业外方代表座谈时说
    中国改革开放只会完善不会改变
    本报天津６月１２日电  天津市市长李瑞环昨天下午会见了天津部分三资企业的外方代表时强调：由邓小平同志亲自制定的改革开放总方针绝不会改变，改革开放不仅要坚持，而且会越来越完善。
    李瑞环首先介绍了天津最近的情况。他说，我作为天津市长，这段时间的中心任务就是防止动乱，稳住天津，不让老百姓受动乱之苦。他说，近几天，一些外国朋友和港澳台朋友暂时离开了天津，这是可以理解的，相信总有一天他们还会回来。李瑞环说，在这种情况下，仍有许多外国朋友留在天津，对我们表示了充分的理解和信任。英国４８家集团副主席打来电传，表示将继续加强与天津的友谊与合作；香港一些企业和公司来电表示愿意向天津贷款；日中石油开发株式会社顾问井山亮先生来电慰问和致意，这家公司在天津的工作人员一个也没有撤走。
    李瑞环说，我可以断言，中国的改革开放方针绝不会改变。研究和解决中国的重大问题、根本问题，都离不开改革开放。否认改革开放，就等于否认了十年来中国人民创造的历史，违背了绝大多数人的意愿和利益。改革开放不仅是经济问题，而且是一个政治问题。民主、自由的程度，离不开经济基础和文明文化程度，而经济建设的发展，文明文化的提高，都有赖于进一步的改革开放。
    李瑞环说，在平息北京的反革命暴乱以后，我们要很冷静地思考一下问题，研究和纠正我们工作中的一些失误，更好地发挥我们的优势，使改革开放搞得更好。
    与会的外国及港澳台商对李瑞环讲话报以热烈掌声，一些人发了言。
