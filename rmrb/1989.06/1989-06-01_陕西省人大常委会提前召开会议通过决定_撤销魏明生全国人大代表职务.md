    Recently, the Seventh Session of the Seventh Shaanxi Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee was convened in advance to specifically discuss the issue of "Feasting Commissioner" Wei Mingsheng's position as a National People's Congress representative. A resolution was passed to revoke his position as a representative of the Seventh National People's Congress.

    Wei Mingsheng was originally the Deputy Secretary of the Ankang Administrative Region. Before his transfer to the position of Deputy Director of the Provincial Economic Commission earlier this year, he had used the pretext of "farewells" and "departures" to engage in extensive feasting and gift-receiving, expending public funds amounting to 5,336 yuan.

    It is understood that on May 17 of this year, the original electoral unit, the Eleventh Session of the Ziyang County People's Congress Standing Committee, held its Seventeenth Meeting and had already removed Wei Mingsheng from his position as a provincial People's Congress representative.

　　陕西省人大常委会提前召开会议通过决定
    撤销魏明生全国人大代表职务
    本报西安６月１日电  记者景险峰报道：日前，陕西省七届人大常委会提前召开第七次会议，专门就“吃喝专员”魏明生的全国人大代表职务问题进行审议，作出了撤销其第七届全国人大代表职务的决定。
    魏明生原是安康行署专员，他在今年初调任省经委副主任之前，曾借“告别”、“辞行”之名，大搞吃请、受礼，耗费公款５３３６元。
    据悉，今年５月１７日，原选举单位安康地区紫阳县十一届人大常委会举行第十七次会议，已经罢免了魏明生的省人大代表的职务。
