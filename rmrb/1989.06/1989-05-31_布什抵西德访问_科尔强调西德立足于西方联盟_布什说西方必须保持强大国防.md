American President Bush arrived in Bonn yesterday afternoon, flying in from Brussels for a 24-hour official working visit to West Germany. Yesterday afternoon and this morning, he held two meetings with Chancellor Kohl and met with West German President Weizsacker. According to local press reports, both sides discussed the recently approved NATO overall plan and the future of West German-American relations. Both sides believe that the results achieved at the NATO summit in Brussels demonstrate the West's alliance's ability to reach consensus. The future of U.S.-West German relations and U.S.-European relations is built on a secure foundation. Chancellor Kohl also briefed President Bush on West Germany's preparations for Gorbachev's visit next month.

Last night, Chancellor Kohl delivered a speech on West Germany's East-West policy at the welcoming banquet for President Bush.

Kohl emphasized that West Germany is firmly rooted in the Western alliance and will not waver between the two worlds. The basic points of West German policy remain unchanged: maintaining friendship and close cooperation with the United States, regarding NATO as a security guarantee, and the European Community as the foundation for prosperity. Being deeply rooted in the Western alliance is the basis for improving relations with the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries.

Bush said in his speech that it is hard to imagine NATO without West Germany, and West Germany without NATO is also hard to imagine. The inherent principles that have guided U.S.-West German friendship and the Atlantic Alliance for 40 years have led to the reconciliation of East and West Europe, bringing the goal of peace closer. He said that the changes in Eastern Europe are encouraging, and the West will promote economic and political reforms in Eastern Europe. However, historical experience should not be forgotten: only by maintaining a strong defense can hope be brought to reduce European divisions and guarantee freedom.

　　布什抵西德访问
    科尔强调西德立足于西方联盟
    布什说西方必须保持强大国防
    本报波恩５月３１日电  记者江建国报道：美国总统布什昨天下午从布鲁塞尔飞抵波恩，对西德进行２４小时的正式工作访问。昨天下午和今天早晨，他先后同科尔总理进行了两次会谈并会见了西德总统魏茨泽克。据此间报刊报道，双方就刚刚通过的北约总体方案，西德美国关系的未来进行了磋商。双方认为，布鲁塞尔北约首脑会议取得的成果表明西方联盟具有达成一致的能力，美国西德关系和美欧关系的未来是建立在有保障的基础之上的。科尔总理还向布什总统通报了西德对下个月戈尔巴乔夫来访的准备情况。
    昨天晚上，科尔总理在欢迎布什总统的宴会上就西德对东西方政策发表了讲话。
    科尔强调说，西德坚定地立足于西方联盟，决不游移于两个世界之间。西德政策的基本点是不变的，这就是：同美国保持友谊和密切合作，把北约作为安全的保证，把欧洲共同体作为繁荣的基础。深深扎根在西方联盟之中正是同苏联东欧国家改善关系的基础。
    布什在讲话中说，很难想象北约里没有西德，西德没有北约也难以想象。指导美国西德友谊和大西洋联盟４０年之久的固有原则，导致东西欧和解，使和平的目标更加接近。他说，东欧的变化是令人鼓舞的，西方将促进东欧的经济和政治改革。但是历史的经验不能忘记，只有保持强大的国防才能为减少欧洲的分裂和保障自由带来希望。
