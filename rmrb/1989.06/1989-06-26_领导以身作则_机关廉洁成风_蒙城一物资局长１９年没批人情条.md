Leaders Set an Example, Bureau Maintains Integrity

A bureau chief in Mengcheng has not approved a single favor-seeking note in 19 years

Xinhua News Agency, Hefei, June 26th (Correspondent Xun Fengming, Reporter Kong Xiangying) Ge Yumin, the director of the Materials Bureau in Mengcheng County, Anhui Province, is known for his integrity and honesty. In his 19 years in office, he has never approved a single favor-seeking note nor accepted any gifts.

Since 1970, when Ge Yumin became the director of the Materials Bureau, he has remained untouched by any hint of corruption. Once, someone from another province came to Ge Yumin seeking approval to buy a car, handing him a wad of money as a "gift." Ge Yumin sternly replied, "I welcome you as a guest, but I despise you for attempting to bribe me." In the past two years, due to the scarcity of materials, nearly a thousand people tried to obtain approval from Ge Yumin to buy goods, but all were rejected.

Even with close friends and relatives, Ge Yumin adheres to his principles. Last year, a close friend of Ge Yumin wanted to build a house and sought to buy subsidized steel. When the friend made the request, Ge Yumin asked, "Since I became the director, I have never approved a single favor-seeking note. As an old friend, do you support me or make things difficult for me?" According to informed sources, since taking office, Ge Yumin has never allowed any of his relatives or friends to gain any advantage from him.

Under Ge Yumin's leadership, the Materials Bureau in Mengcheng County has maintained a culture of integrity and honesty for over a decade. No one has violated regulations in their duties, and the bureau has not had any economic crimes. It has been consecutively named an advanced unit by the provincial and municipal materials systems for 16 years.

　　领导以身作则　机关廉洁成风    
    蒙城一物资局长１９年没批人情条
    新华社合肥６月２６日电（通讯员荀凤鸣、记者孔祥迎）安徽省蒙城县物资局长葛玉民清正廉明，在任１９年，没批过一张人情条子，没接受过一件礼物。
    葛玉民从１９７０年担任物资局长来，身上没有沾半点“铜臭味”。一次，外地一个人找葛玉民批条子买汽车，他一边说话，一边掏出一叠子人民币递了过去，说是见面礼。葛玉民板着面孔说：“你作为客人，我欢迎你，你要行贿，我厌恶你。”近两年来，由于物资紧缺，有近千人通过各种渠道找葛玉民批条子买货物，都被他拒绝了。
    在亲朋故旧面前，葛玉民照样坚持原则。去年，葛玉民的一位至交要盖房子，想买平价钢材。谁知他一提出要求，葛玉民就问他：“我自当局长以来从没批过条子，作为老朋友，你是支持我还是为难我？”据知情人介绍，葛玉民任职以来，亲戚朋友谁也没从他那里占过一分钱便宜。
    在葛玉民的带动下，蒙城县物资局清正廉明蔚然成风，十多年来没有人办事违反规定，这个局也没发生过经济案件，连续１６年被省、地物资系统评为先进单位。
