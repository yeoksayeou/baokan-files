Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 19th.

In recent periods, the China Patent Office has been smoothly handling the acceptance and examination of domestic and foreign patent applications. Gao Lulin, Deputy Director of the China Patent Office, said that the future of China's patent industry is very promising.

Gao Lulin told reporters that in April and May this year, the China Patent Office received a total of 5,853 patent applications, an increase of 11.7% compared to the same period last year. Among these, 959 applications were from overseas, an increase of 13.6% compared to the same period last year. During this period, the office completed the substantive examination of 682 invention patent applications, an increase of 42.7% compared to the same period last year.

According to foreign-related patent agencies such as the China Patent Agency (Hong Kong) Limited and the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade Patent Agency, the number of business delegations they have accepted from overseas clients has been continuously increasing since April. After the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, foreign-related patent agencies conducted a survey among overseas clients, and the clients still have a positive outlook on the Chinese market. Some foreign companies have even invited the China Patent Agency Association to visit their countries.

Gao Lulin happily informed reporters that the "21st Century and Patents" international seminar, jointly organized by the World Intellectual Property Organization and the Chinese government, will be held in Beijing as originally planned in early November. Currently, invitations have been sent to more than 120 member countries of the World Intellectual Property Organization, and all preparations are proceeding smoothly.

At the same time, the National Patent Documentation Center, China Patent Documentation Center, has completed the final construction work and will open as scheduled on July 1st.

Gao Lulin said that the establishment and improvement of the patent system in China is one of the important achievements of the ten years of reform and opening up. Currently, the China Patent Office has accepted nearly 100,000 patent applications and granted 21,920 patents, playing an important role in protecting intellectual property rights and promoting the commercialization of technological achievements. At the same time, the China Patent Office has established business relations with 56 countries and regions, becoming an important aspect of China's external scientific and technological cooperation and exchange. He expressed that the Chinese government will cherish this hard-won achievement and strive to promote the further prosperity of the patent industry.

　　专利申请近十万件　近一时期又有增加
    中国专利事业前景乐观
    新华社北京６月１９日电  近一个时期来，中国专利局国内外专利申请的受理、审查工作始终正常进行。中国专利局副局长高卢麟说，中国专利事业的前景是十分乐观的。
    高卢麟向记者介绍说，今年４月和５月，中国专利局共收到专利申请５８５３件，比去年同期增长１１．７％；其中来自国外的申请有９５９件，比去年同期增长１３．６％。这期间，专利局对发明专利申请的实质性审查共结案６８２件，比去年同期增长了４２．７％。
    据中国涉外专利代理机构中国专利代理（香港）有限公司和中国贸促会专利代理部等反映，４月份以来，它们接受国外客户委托代理的业务数量持续增加。北京发生的反革命暴乱平息后，涉外专利代理机构曾向国外客户作过调查，客户仍然对中国市场看好。有的外国公司还邀请中国专利代理协会访问他们的国家。
    高卢麟高兴地告诉记者，由联合国知识产权组织和中国政府联合主办的“２１世纪与专利”国际研讨会，将按原定计划于１１月初在北京举行。目前，已向知识产权组织的１２０多个成员国发出邀请信，一切筹备工作正在顺利进行。
    同时，我国的国家专利文献中心中国专利文献馆，已完成了建馆的扫尾工作，将于７月１日如期开放。
    高卢麟说，专利制度在我国的建立和完善，是十年改革开放的重要成就之一。目前，中国专利局已接受专利申请近１０万件，授予专利权２１９２０项，为保护知识产权、促进技术成果商品化发挥了重要作用。同时，中国专利局已同５６个国家和地区建立业务联系，成为我国对外科技合作与交流的一个重要方面。他表示中国政府将珍惜这一来之不易的成就，努力促进专利事业的进一步繁荣。
