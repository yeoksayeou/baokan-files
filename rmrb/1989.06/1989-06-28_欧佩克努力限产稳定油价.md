OPEC Strives to Limit Production to Stabilize Oil Prices

Xinhua News Agency, Caracas, June 26 - OPEC Secretary-General Subroto stated on June 26 in Caracas that member countries of the organization will strictly adhere to the principle of not exporting more than 19.5 million barrels of oil per day on the international oil market to ensure that oil prices rebound to $18 per barrel in the second half of the year.

He said that the international oil market price in the second quarter of this year was $17 per barrel.

Subroto made these remarks at the opening of the 11th conference of the International Association for Energy Economics.

The theme of this conference is to discuss the development and supply of energy over the next 10 years.

He pointed out that the demand for oil on the international market will increase. In the second half of this year, the world will need 52 million barrels of oil per day, of which OPEC member countries will produce 22 million barrels per day.

Subroto also revealed that, at the suggestion of Venezuelan President Perez, OPEC will hold a summit meeting on the occasion of its 30th anniversary next year to formulate the organization's future action strategy.

　　欧佩克努力限产稳定油价
    新华社加拉加斯６月２６日电  欧佩克秘书长苏布罗托２６日在加拉加斯指出，该组织成员国将严格遵守在国际石油市场上每天出口石油不超过１９５０万桶的原则，以使国际石油市场油价在下半年回升到每桶１８美元。
    他说，今年第二季度，国际石油市场油价为每桶１７美元。
    苏布罗托是在２６日开幕的国际能源经济学家协会第１１次会议上讲这番话的。
    这次会议的议题是探讨未来１０年的能源开发和供应问题。
    他指出，国际石油市场需求将有所增加。今年下半年，世界每天需要石油５２００万桶，其中欧佩克组织成员国每天生产２２００万桶。
    苏布罗托还透露，根据委内瑞拉总统佩雷斯的提议，欧佩克组织将在明年成立３０周年之际召开首脑会议，以制定该组织未来的行动战略。
