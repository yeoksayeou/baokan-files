The All-China Pioneers' Federation has issued a notice on June 16th to carry out the "Love the Party, Love the Country, Love the Army" education campaign.

The notice states that to implement the Party Central Committee's requirement of conducting education on the four cardinal principles among the people, the All-China Pioneers' Federation has decided to carry out the education campaign of "Loving the Communist Party of China, Loving the People's Republic of China, and Loving the People's Liberation Army" among all Young Pioneers. The campaign requires all levels of Young Pioneers' organizations to:

1. Conduct in-depth education on loving the Communist Party of China. Countless facts tell us that only the Communist Party of China is the core leader of China's reform and construction. To uphold the four cardinal principles, we must first uphold the leadership of the Communist Party of China. We must educate the broad masses of Young Pioneers to understand that the practice of China's revolution and construction has repeatedly proven that our party is a great and correct party. We must make them establish from a young age the firm belief of loving the party, supporting the party, and following the party's lead.

2. Conduct extensive education on loving the People's Republic of China. We must use the history of China's revolution to educate Young Pioneers to understand that only socialism can save China, and that China's reform and opening up must adhere to the socialist path and must have social stability and unity.

3. Actively organize education on loving the People's Liberation Army. We must use the glorious history of the People's Liberation Army liberating and defending the people, and the great merits it has established in the struggle to stabilize the overall situation of the country, to make Young Pioneers recognize from a young age that the People's Liberation Army is the iron wall defending socialist motherland and the strong pillar of people's democratic dictatorship. All levels of Young Pioneers' organizations must use vivid typical examples to educate Young Pioneers, learning the brave and selfless spirit of the People's Liberation Army, the tenacious spirit of overcoming difficulties, and the deep affection for the motherland and the people.

　　爱党　爱国　爱军
    全国少工委部署教育活动
    据新华社北京６月１７日电  中国少年先锋队全国工作委员会６月１６日发出关于开展“爱党、爱国、爱军”教育活动的通知。
    通知说，为了贯彻党中央提出的在人民中进行四项基本原则教育的要求，全国少工委决定在全体少先队员中广泛开展“热爱中国共产党，热爱社会主义人民共和国，热爱中国人民解放军”的教育活动，要求各级少先队组织做到：
    一、深入进行热爱中国共产党的教育。无数事实告诉我们，只有中国共产党才是中国改革、建设的领导核心，坚持四项基本原则，首先要坚持中国共产党的领导。要教育广大少先队员懂得，中国革命和建设的实践不断证明，我们的党是伟大、正确的党，要使他们从小树立热爱党，拥护党，跟着党走的坚定信念。
    二、广泛开展热爱社会主义人民共和国的教育。要用中国革命的历史，教育少先队员明确只有社会主义才能够救中国的道理，明确中国的改革、开放必须坚持社会主义道路，必须有社会的安定团结。
    三、积极组织热爱中国人民解放军的教育。要用人民解放军解放人民、保卫人民的光荣历史和在稳定全国大局的斗争中所建立的巨大功勋，使少先队员从小认清人民解放军是保卫社会主义祖国的钢铁长城，是人民民主专政的坚强柱石。各级少先队组织要用生动的典型事例，对少先队员进行教育，学习解放军英勇无畏的献身精神，勇于克服困难的顽强精神，忠诚祖国、热爱人民的深厚感情。
