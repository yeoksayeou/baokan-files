Over the past two years, trade along the Sino-Soviet border has developed rapidly, with an increasing number of people engaging in business and labor services. The friendly exchanges between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union have also become more frequent. Heihe City and Blagoveshchensk City launched the "Sino-Soviet One-Day Tour" last year, where trade deals were signed and cooperation projects were initiated.
