West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl yesterday delivered a government statement in the Federal Parliament regarding the recent NATO summit and U.S. President Bush's visit to West Germany. He stated that the NATO summit was a successful meeting, and West Germany's position was affirmed. He expressed that the West should support the reform processes in the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, creating conditions for constructive dialogue and cooperation between the East and the West.

Kohl said that the NATO summit achieved important results. It determined NATO's overall policy for the next 10 years.

He stated that risks still exist, and the balance of military power has not yet been achieved. However, unprecedented changes have occurred in the Warsaw Pact and the Soviet Union, making it possible to maintain European peace with the fewest weapons possible for an extended period. For NATO, it is still necessary to maintain a defense that is as low as possible but reliable, strengthen the partnership with the United States, and through dialogue and cooperation, overcome the division of Europe, especially Germany.

In discussing the West's attitude towards the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, he said that the entire West is prepared to support their reforms to the greatest extent possible.

    本报波恩６月２日电  记者江建国报道：西德总理科尔昨天在联邦议院就最近召开的北约首脑会议和布什总统访问西德发表政府声明说，北约首脑会议是一次成功的会议，西德的立场得到确认；他表示西方应该支持苏联东欧国家的改革进程，为东西方建设性的对话和合作创造条件。
    科尔说，北约首脑会议取得了重要成果。它确定了北约在今后１０年的总的政策。
    他说，风险依然存在，军备力量尚未平衡，但是华约和苏联都发生了史无前例的变化，因此用尽可能少的武器持久地维护欧洲和平的可能性已经展现。对于北约来说，仍然要保持尽可能低水平，同时又是可靠的防务，加强同美国的伙伴关系，同时通过对话和合作克服欧洲特别是德国的分裂。
    他在谈到西方对苏联、东欧的态度时说，整个西方都准备在尽可能的范围内支持它们的改革。
