    Towards the Distant Mountains
    Rú Bīng

    Even on a clear day, you are shrouded in mist and clouds, like a shy young girl, hiding your secrets in an air of mystery.

    I always imagined that beneath your cloak of clouds, there must be a beautiful, warm world: green mountains, clear waters, the chirping of swallows…

    One summer evening, after a heavy rain, a rainbow stretched across the sky, and you appeared clearly before me for the first time. In the twilight, you were a patchwork of pale yellow and pink, so beautiful. But when I went to fetch my sketchbook, you had put on your cloudy cloak again. Your maidenly shyness and your general's grandeur deeply moved me!

    On a day with a high sky and scattered clouds, I began my journey towards you. I don't know how many mountains I crossed, how many ravines I waded through, how much blood and sweat I shed, until I finally stood before you, exhausted.

    No lush green grass, no fields of flowers, no…

    Dry, cracked earth, endless barren hills, jagged stone slopes—is this you?

    The object of my longing? The goal of my pursuit?

    Two tears fell onto the dusty ground.

    Decades? Centuries? I don't know how long it took, but I was awakened by the sound of birdsong.

    What can I say to you? I choose you! I admit, you are desolate and barren, but don't you have the songs of birds? Then you have a living heart. I will plant the first green tree in your embrace, sow the first orchid.

    I will, I definitely will!

    Do you believe me?

　　走向远山
    如冰
    即使在晴天，你也是云雾霏霏，恰似一位含羞的少女，那样的寓不言不话于神秘莫测之中。
    我总猜想，你那件云雾衣下面一定是个美丽温馨的世界：山翠水绿，燕语呢喃……
    一个夏季的黄昏，大雨滂沱之后，彩虹横亘在天际，你第一次清晰地出现在我的面前，黄昏中的你，一片片浅黄，粉红，好美好美。可是当我从房中拿出画板时，你又穿起了那件云雾衣。你少女般的羞赧、大将般的雄浑，深深地震撼着我！
    在一个天高云淡的日子里，我开始向你挺进，不知翻过了多少高山，涉过多少沟壑，淌下了多少血汗，终于疲惫不堪地站在你的面前。
    没有如茵的绿草，没有似锦野花，没有……
    干涸的龟土，绵延的荒丘，嶙峋的石坡，这便是你么？
    我心之向往？我心之追求？
    两行清泪滴落在尘土中。
    几十年？几百年？几个世纪？不知过了多久，我被一阵鸟语声惊醒。
    我能对你说些什么？我只愿选择你！我承认，你荒芜、贫瘠，但你不是有鸟语吗？那你就有一颗活的心。我要在你的怀中栽活第一棵绿树，种上第一株兰花。
    我会的，一定会的！
    你相信么？
