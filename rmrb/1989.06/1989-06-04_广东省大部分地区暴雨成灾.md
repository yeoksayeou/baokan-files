A strong typhoon made landfall in Taishan, Guangdong on the 3rd, bringing continuous heavy or torrential rainstorms to most parts of the province. Many cities and counties have suffered severe damage.

Statistics show that 38 counties experienced heavy rain, 28 of which had torrential downpours, and 10 had extreme rainstorms. Major rivers in Guangdong, including the Bei River, Dong River, and Han River, all exceeded their warning water levels. Due to the typhoon's intensity, the wide range of the rainfall, and its duration, 11 cities, including Jiangmen, Zhaoqing, and Yangjiang, and 48 counties were affected, with 13 counties severely damaged. The total area of agricultural land affected was 4.91 million mu, including 3.21 million mu of rice fields. The number of people affected reached 1.326 million, with 84 deaths and 263 injuries. A total of 135,000 houses collapsed; a large number of roads, bridges, communication facilities, and water conservancy projects were damaged. The provincial government has dispatched eight work teams to work with local officials and residents to rescue and relieve the affected areas.

　　广东省大部分地区暴雨成灾
    据新华社广州六月三日电（记者张开机）三号强台风在广东台山登陆后，暴雨或特大暴雨接连不断袭击广东，大部分市县受灾严重。
    据统计，受强台风影响，有三十八个县降了暴雨，其中二十八个县降了大暴雨，十个县降了特大暴雨。广东境内的主要河流北江、东江、韩江等都曾出现超警戒水位。由于台风强度大、暴雨范围广、时间长，造成江门、肇庆、阳江等十一个市的四十八个县受灾，其中重灾县十三个。农业受灾面积达四百九十一万亩，其中水稻三百二十一万亩；受灾人口一百三十二点六万人，死亡八十四人，受伤二百六十三人，倒塌房屋一点三五万间；损坏公路、桥梁、通讯设备和水利工程等一大批。省政府派出了八个工作组与当地干部群众奋力救灾。
