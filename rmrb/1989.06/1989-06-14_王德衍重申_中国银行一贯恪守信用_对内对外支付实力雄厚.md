Wang Deyan, the president of the Bank of China, recently stated in an interview with a reporter that Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly stated on June 9th during a meeting with senior officers of the martial law troops that the focus on one central task and the two fundamental principles are correct and will not change. The policy of reform and opening up will continue. We at the Bank of China would like to emphasize this basic policy to our friends in the international financial community. Now, on behalf of the Bank of China, I solemnly reiterate:

First, the Bank of China guarantees payment for all letters of credit, guarantees, and various forms of external debts issued by the Bank of China.

Second, the policy of free deposit and withdrawal for individual foreign currency deposits within the country will remain unchanged. The principle of depositing foreign currency and withdrawing foreign currency will be strictly adhered to. Recently, there have been rumors that starting from July 1st, all foreign currency deposits will be paid in Renminbi, which is completely groundless and false.

Third, the Bank of China will, under any circumstances, uphold its domestic and international credibility and the country's international credibility. In these past few days, even during the most tense days of June 3rd and 4th, most of our employees, especially the heads of various departments, remained at their posts. Therefore, there was no impact on external payments.

　　王德衍重申——
    中国银行一贯恪守信用
    对内对外支付实力雄厚
    本报北京６月１４日讯  中国银行总行行长王德衍日前在接受记者采访时说，邓小平同志９日在接见戒严部队军以上干部时讲得很清楚，一个中心，两个基本点，是对的，不会变。改革开放会继续坚持下去。我们中国银行愿意向外国金融界的朋友们再强调一下这个基本国策。现在，我代表中国银行郑重地重申：
    第一，凡是中国银行开出的信用证、保函以及各种形式的对外债务，中国银行保证对外支付。
    第二，国内个人外币存款，坚持存取自由，存外币、取外币的原则。这个政策不会改变。最近有人造谣，从７月１日开始外币存款都支付人民币，这完全是毫无根据的造谣。
    第三，中国银行在任何情况下，都会维护自己的对内、对外信誉，维护国家的对外信誉。这几天，甚至在６月３日、６月４日最紧张的日子里，我行大部分职工，尤其是各个部门的负责人，都坚守岗位，因此没有影响对外支付。
