The seven provinces and autonomous regions send a telegram to the Central Authorities: Resolutely support the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital

To the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission:

On June 3rd and 4th, the martial law troops in the capital resolutely executed the orders of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission. With the cooperation of the workers and citizens of the capital, they decisively and firmly crushed a serious counter-revolutionary rebellion. We are extremely indignant at the few criminals who created a counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital! We resolutely support the major decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, and express our highest respect to the martial law troops of the People's Liberation Army, the armed police, the public security officers, and the people of the capital who participated in suppressing the rebellion!

The development of the situation fully shows that this rebellion is an attempt to overthrow the People's Republic of China, to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, and to overthrow the socialist system. If their plot succeeds, the republic, which was won by the blood and sacrifice of countless revolutionary martyrs, will be destroyed, and our reform, opening up, and socialist construction will be in vain. The Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission took decisive measures at a critical moment to suppress the rebellion, representing the fundamental interests of the entire Party and the people of the whole country. This is completely correct. We firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, this struggle will definitely achieve final victory.

The Shaanxi Provincial Party Committee, Provincial Government, and Provincial Military Region will, as always, maintain a high degree of unity with the Central Committee of the Communist Party, follow the instructions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council, and do a good job in Shaanxi. We must organize all Party members and cadres in the province to seriously study the "Notice to All Party Members and the People of the Whole Country by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council," fully understand the extreme seriousness of this struggle, unify our thoughts, and stand firm in the face of major principles and issues. We must resolutely expose the plots and rumors of a few people, unite the vast majority of the people and students, and clearly oppose the turmoil. We must resolutely crack down on lawless elements who take advantage of the situation to engage in acts of beating, smashing, looting, and arson, protect the safety of people's lives and property, and stabilize the situation. All Communist Party members and the people of Shaanxi Province are determined to unite around the Central Committee of the Communist Party and carry out this struggle against the rebellion to the end!

To the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission:

In recent days, we have seriously studied the "Notice to All Party Members and the People of the Whole Country by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council," watched and listened to important news about the situation in the capital, and are extremely indignant at the criminal acts of a few rioters who instigated a counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing. We resolutely support the decisive measures taken by the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission to suppress the rebellion, and express our highest respect for the martial law troops, armed police, and public security officers who, in protecting the people and students, adopted a restrained attitude and demonstrated great revolutionary spirit in suppressing the rebellion. We firmly believe that our Party is a great Party that has been tested by history, our people are a people with consciousness and a sense of the overall situation, and our army is the people's army under the leadership of the Party. Under the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council, we will definitely be able to overcome the difficulties we face, suppress the rebellion, stop the turmoil, restore normal order, and continue to push forward the cause of reform and opening up and modernization construction in our country.

Currently, the situation in Tibet is basically stable. Since implementing the spirit of the important speeches by Li Peng and Yang Shangkun, the martial law in Lhasa City has been effectively implemented, schools are teaching as usual, and the order of social production and life is normal. However, we are also clearly aware that domestic and foreign separatist forces are still active, trying to find opportunities to stir up trouble and create new disturbances, and we must not let down our guard.

According to the spirit of the instructions from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, we have made arrangements, requiring all Party members in the region to continue to seriously study the important speeches by the Central Committee leaders and the "Notice to All Party Members and the People of the Whole Country by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council," and resolutely do so in political thought and action to maintain unity with the Central Committee, and fully play the role of the vanguard and model of Party organizations and Party members at all levels; requiring all ethnic people in the region to unite their thoughts to the overall situation of stabilizing the situation, and clearly oppose the turmoil, and not do anything that is not conducive to unity and stability; requiring all workers to continue to guard their posts and do a good job in all aspects of work, with practical actions to maintain unity and stability, and maintain the stability of the situation; requiring the People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet, public security officers, and armed police to further strictly implement the martial law in Lhasa and its various measures; requiring Party and government organizations at all levels to strengthen positive guidance and in-depth and detailed ideological and political work, strictly implement policy boundaries, closely monitor social trends, strive to do work in advance, and solve problems in the bud. At the same time, we must firmly implement the policy of "two hands," for the defense of the southwestern border of the motherland, for the basic stability of the situation in Tibet, and for the completion of the economic and social development plan for this year.

To the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission:

On the morning of June 4th, after we listened to the news of the martial law troops in the capital quickly suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion and the editorial of the "Liberation Army Daily," we immediately organized a discussion meeting; on June 5th, after the "Notice to All Party Members and the People of the Whole Country by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council" was issued, the Provincial Party Committee held a meeting of the Provincial Party Committee, Provincial Committee of Political Consultative Conference, Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, Provincial Government, Provincial Committee of Political Consultative Conference, Provincial Military Region, and the heads of various departments and bureaus under the Provincial Government in the afternoon to conduct a serious study and discussion. Everyone unanimously agreed that the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission took decisive and resolute measures to quickly suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital, which is completely correct, and we resolutely support it. The rebellion that occurred in the capital is the malicious development of the plot by a few people to create turmoil, and is the concentrated exposure of their evil intentions to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party of China, attempt to overthrow the People's Republic of China, and overthrow the socialist system. At a critical moment when the fate of the Party and the state is facing a serious threat, the martial law troops in the capital, in an unbearable situation, took decisive measures to resolutely suppress this rebellion, and once again established a historical merit for defending the Central Committee of the Communist Party, defending the People's Republic, and defending the capital Beijing. We hereby express our highest respect and warm greetings to all the soldiers and officers of the martial law troops in the capital.

We will definitely organize and mobilize all Party members and the people of the province to do a good job in stabilizing the overall situation and stabilizing Hunan, and support the correct decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission with practical actions. To this end, we have studied and taken the following measures:

(1) Strengthen positive propaganda and do a good job in ideological and political work patiently and meticulously. Immediately organize the broad masses of cadres and the people to seriously study the "Notice to All Party Members and the People of the Whole Country by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council," seriously study the editorial of the "Liberation Army Daily" on June 4th, study the speech by Li Ximing on June 4th at the meeting of the heads of departments, offices, and commissions in Beijing, and the speech by Yuan Mu and others at the press conference on June 6th, understand the facts, do not believe in rumors, and do not spread rumors. All Party members must firmly maintain unity with the Central Committee of the Communist Party, strictly observe discipline, distinguish right from wrong, consider the overall situation, and pass this political struggle test. All cadres and workers must firmly guard their posts and strive to do a good job in production and work, and make contributions to stabilizing Hunan and stabilizing the overall situation.

(2) The Party and government leaders at all levels, departments, and units must do everything possible to do a good job in stabilizing work in their respective regions, departments, and units. At present, various contradictions are intertwined, and leaders at all levels must adhere to principles and pay attention to methods, strictly distinguish between two different types of contradictions, and properly handle various sudden events, and strive to do a good job in stabilizing the emotions of the masses.

(3) Strengthen the security protection of key positions and strictly prevent a few lawless elements from taking advantage of the situation to engage in sabotage. Those who continue to engage in criminal acts of beating, smashing, looting, and arson must be severely punished according to law, and we will not be lenient.

(4) The Party and government leadership organs at all levels must organize two sets of teams, divide responsibilities, and make comprehensive arrangements to do a good job in stabilizing the situation and organizing agricultural and industrial production, and ensure the smooth progress of construction and reform.

To the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission:

On the morning of June 4th, after we listened to the editorial of the "Liberation Army Daily" "Resolutely Support the Decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party, Resolutely Suppress the Counter-Revolutionary Rebellion" and the news of the martial law troops in the capital suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, Provincial Party Secretary He Zhukang presided over an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee attended by the heads of the Provincial Committee of Political Consultative Conference, Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, Provincial Government, Provincial Committee of Political Consultative Conference, Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, and Provincial Military Region, and conducted a serious discussion. The attendees unanimously agreed that the serious counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in the capital is unprecedented since the founding of the country, and is the malicious development of the plot by a few people to create turmoil in a period of time, and is the concentrated exposure of their evil intentions to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party of China and attempt to overthrow the socialist system. In order to defend the great People's Republic of China, defend the sacred Constitution, and defend the solemn capital, the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission made a decisive decision to resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, which is a completely just action and completely in line with the fundamental interests of the people of the capital and the people of the whole country. We completely support and support this correct decision, and express our highest respect and warm greetings to the soldiers and officers of the martial law troops in Beijing who made great contributions to suppressing the rebellion. To win the final victory in this struggle, on June 5th, the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council issued the "Notice to All Party Members and the People of the Whole Country," which is very timely and extremely important, expressing the wishes of the entire Party and the people of the whole country. We completely believe in the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, which have the strength and means to completely suppress this rebellion. According to the deployment of the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council, we will start from the actual situation of Jilin Province, unite as one, and work hard, and with the actual actions of stabilizing Jilin, make contributions to stabilizing the overall situation of the country. In recent days, we have mainly done the following:

1. Organize the broad masses of Party members and the people to seriously study the "Notice to All Party Members and the People of the Whole Country by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council." The Provincial Party Committee first held an enlarged meeting of the Standing Committee for study, and at the same time issued a notice, requiring all Party organizations and governments at all levels in the province to seriously study and resolutely implement it. Party organizations at all levels and systems in the province immediately took action, leading the broad masses of Party members and cadres to do as required by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council, and maintain unity with the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council in politics, thought, and action, stand firm, be clear-cut, observe discipline, guard their posts, stand out, work actively, and resolutely fight against the few people who plot to create turmoil, and maintain a politically stable situation of unity and stability.

2. Strengthen propaganda and public opinion guidance. The leaders of the province and Changchun City and relevant departments timely held a meeting of some labor models, union cadres, and people from all walks of life in the province and Changchun City, and carefully organized reports, propagated the spirit of the instructions from the Central Committee, reflected the righteous voice of the broad masses, and fully played the role of public opinion guidance of mass media, helping the masses to clarify confused ideas with facts, expose the plots of a few people, and refute various rumors, and unify their thoughts to the spirit of the Central Committee.

3. Focus on doing a good job in colleges and universities. Continue to adhere to principles, continue to guide, and firmly rely on the leadership, Party and League organizations, teachers, and student cadres of colleges and universities to do patient and meticulous ideological and political work, and seriously point out the nature of this struggle, guide the broad masses of students to seriously and calmly think about problems, and rationally and correctly judge right from wrong. Require colleges and universities to strictly enforce school rules and regulations, and quickly restore normal teaching order, and resolutely stop various acts of violating discipline, violating the law, and disrupting unity and stability.

4. Strengthen economic work and stabilize factories and all enterprises. The Party organizations and union organizations at all levels mobilize the broad masses of workers to play the role of the main force of the working class, overcome difficulties and unfavorable factors, and basically maintain normal production. Commercial and other relevant departments do everything possible to ensure market supply and arrange people's lives. At the same time, strengthen social security, and severely punish a few criminals who engage in beating, smashing, looting, arson, and killing to create turmoil, and maintain normal work, production, and living order.

5. Further strengthen leadership and fully play the role of the Party organizations as fortresses and the Party members as vanguards and models. The Party organizations at all levels strengthen collective leadership, and for major issues, fully discuss and make correct decisions. The Party and government leaders at all levels are loyal to their duties, take responsibility, work together, and strive together to continue to push forward construction and reform.

We clearly put forward that the current situation is a critical moment to test every Party member and cadre, and require the broad masses of Party members and cadres to definitely see through the situation, distinguish right from wrong, and firmly stand with the Central Committee of the Communist Party, and clearly oppose the turmoil, and resolutely fight against all enemy elements who plot to create turmoil, and make their due contributions to the Party and the people.

To the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council:

After the "Notice to All Party Members and the People of the Whole Country by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council" was issued on June 5th, the Provincial Party Committee, Provincial Government, Provincial Committee of Political Consultative Conference, Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, and Provincial Committee of Political Consultative Conference held a meeting of the heads of the Provincial Party Committee, Provincial Committee of Political Consultative Conference, Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, Provincial People's Congress Standing Committee, Provincial Government, Provincial Committee of Political Consultative Conference, and Provincial Military Region, and conducted a serious study and discussion. In the study, everyone expressed their resolute support for the decision made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission to suppress the serious counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, and expressed their respect and greetings to the soldiers and officers of the martial law troops who made meritorious deeds in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and the armed police and public security officers. Everyone also unanimously expressed that they would continue to do a good job in all aspects of work, strive to stabilize the situation in Jiangsu, and make practical contributions to stabilizing the overall situation of the country.

According to the spirit of the "Notice to All Party Members and the People of the Whole Country by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council," we have further analyzed the situation in our province and are currently focusing on doing a good job in the following aspects:

1. Organize Party members, cadres, and the masses to seriously study the "Notice to All Party Members and the People of the Whole Country by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council." We have issued a notice, requiring all Party committees and governments at all levels to organize all Party members and the broad masses to seriously study it, understand the current severe situation, understand the truth about the serious counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, distinguish right from wrong, improve their understanding, unite as one, guard their posts, and strive to do a good job in production and work.

2. Play the role of the Party organizations as fortresses and the Party members as vanguards and models. We require all Party organizations to stand in the front line in the current situation, dare to do work, and be good at doing work, unite the broad masses of the people, and strive to stabilize the situation in Jiangsu and support the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital, and stabilize the country. The broad masses of Communist Party members must maintain high unity with the Central Committee in politics, and clearly oppose the plots of a few people to create turmoil, oppose the leadership of the Party, and overthrow the socialist system, and resolutely fight against it. They must strictly observe discipline, set an example, be loyal to their duties, and consciously maintain a politically stable situation of unity and stability. And educate their children and relatives, and do a good job in the work of the surrounding masses.

3. Start from the actual situation in Jiangsu, do a good job in all aspects of work, and strive to stabilize the situation in Jiangsu. In the past period, the Provincial Party Committee, Provincial Government, Nanjing Municipal Party Committee, and Municipal Government have respectively done the work of colleges and universities, enterprises and institutions, government cadres, and news and public opinion units, and also paid attention to timely reporting to the democratic parties, mobilizing various forces, uniting as one, and working together to strive to stabilize the situation in Jiangsu. For the broad masses of young students, continue to do a good job in guiding and educating them, stabilize their emotions, maintain their rationality, and quickly return to school to attend classes, and do not do anything that goes against the interests of the state and the people. For the broad masses of workers in enterprises and institutions, emphasize guarding their production posts and doing a good job in their own work, and use the actual actions of increasing production to make contributions to stabilizing the situation. Educate young students and the broad masses not to believe in and spread rumors, not to engage in any form of liaison, not to do anything that is not conducive to the Party and the state, and not to do anything that hurts the people and pleases the enemy, and strive to create a good social environment for stabilizing the situation.

4. Strive to maintain normal work order, production order, and living order. Rely on the broad masses of cadres and the people, take various measures to ensure the smooth operation of various transportation facilities, especially urban and railway transportation; concentrate all efforts to do a good job in market supply, especially the supply of people's living necessities; and solve various urgent problems in production in time to provide necessary conditions for the maintenance of normal production by grassroots enterprises.

5. Strictly prevent various criminal elements from taking advantage of the situation to engage in sabotage activities. We require the political and legal departments to be highly vigilant against all kinds of criminal activities at all times, and never relax the struggle against them. Once it is found that someone takes advantage of the situation to engage in beating, smashing, looting, arson, hooliganism, theft, and other criminal activities, decisive measures must be taken to severely punish them according to law.

To the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council:

On the morning of June 4th, after we listened to the editorial of the "Liberation Army Daily" and the speech by the spokesperson of the martial law troops headquarters, as well as the reports on suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the Standing Committee of the Provincial Party Committee and the leaders of the Provincial Government immediately held a meeting and conducted a serious discussion. The attendees expressed great indignation at a group of troublemakers who actually created a counter-revolutionary rebellion in our great motherland's capital. Everyone unanimously agreed that this shocking counter-revolutionary rebellion is the malicious development of the plot by a few people to create turmoil in more than a month, and is the concentrated exposure of their evil intentions to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system. Facing this serious situation, the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission quickly made a decision and took decisive measures to resolutely suppress this counter-revolutionary rebellion, which is completely correct. Everyone unanimously expressed their support for the correct decision made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and resolutely support the just actions of the martial law troops and the public security officers and armed police in the capital. To further stabilize the situation in Henan, the meeting decided to take the following measures:

1. All regions, departments, and units in the province must quickly organize the broad masses of Party members, cadres, workers, peasants, students, and urban residents to seriously study and widely publicize the editorial of the "Liberation Army Daily" on June 4th, the speech by the spokesperson of the martial law troops headquarters, and the reports on suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, understand the true face and essence of this counter-revolutionary rebellion, understand the necessity of resolutely suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and truly unify their thoughts with the correct decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party.

2. The broad masses of cadres and workers in all industries must, at a critical moment, strictly observe discipline, guard their posts, and do their duties to maintain social stability. All Party and government cadres and workers must not only not believe in and spread rumors and not support and participate in activities that are not conducive to unity and stability, but also take the lead in doing a good job in their relatives, children, and the masses, and make due contributions to stopping the turmoil and stabilizing the situation. The broad masses of enterprise workers must strictly observe the national laws and factory rules, guard their production posts, and consciously maintain normal production order.

3. The Party and government leaders of colleges and universities at all levels must take effective measures to do a good job in the ideological and political work of students and mobilize them to quickly return to school. They must resolutely oppose the so-called "empty school" activities instigated by a few people, and effectively stop some people from going to factories, mines, enterprises, and rural areas to engage in liaison activities. Those who do not listen to persuasion and insist on their own way must be criticized and educated, and even disciplined.

4. Severely crack down on the sabotage activities of a handful of bad people. All regions and units must be vigilant and closely monitor social trends, and be prepared to deal with possible complex situations. Those who instigate and plot the turmoil must be resolutely exposed and cracked down on, and those who take advantage of the situation to engage in beating, smashing, looting, and arson must be severely punished according to law. Continue to severely crack down on the sabotage activities of criminal elements, and take all necessary measures to maintain good social order.

5. All regions, departments, and units must continue to do a good job in agricultural and industrial production, market supply, transportation, and the rectification and deepening of reform, and use the actual actions of doing a good job in work and production to support the correct decision of the Central Committee of the Communist Party.

On the afternoon and evening of the 4th, the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government held a meeting of the heads of the provincial departments and the heads of the cities, prefectures, and counties, respectively, and required them to strengthen leadership, seriously implement the above five measures, do a good job in work, and maintain social stability in the province.

On the 5th, after the "Notice to All Party Members and the People of the Whole Country by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council" was issued, we immediately conducted a study and issued a notice to all regions in the province, requiring all regions, departments, and units in the province to quickly organize the broad masses of Party members, cadres, and the people to seriously study it, deeply understand it, and make it known to every household and every person, and resolutely implement it. At present, all regions in the province are doing a good job in accordance with the requirements of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government, and are working hard and meticulously.

    坚决拥护平息在首都发生的反革命暴乱
    陕西省党中央、国务院、中央军委：
    ６月３日、４日，首都戒严部队坚决执行党中央、国务院、中央军委的命令，在首都工人和市民的配合下，坚决果断地粉碎了一场严重的反革命暴乱。我们对极少数歹徒在首都制造反革命暴乱，表示极大的愤慨！我们坚决拥护党中央、国务院、中央军委的重大决策，并向参加平息暴乱的解放军戒严部队指战员和武警部队、公安干警以及首都人民，表示崇高的敬意！
    事态的发展充分表明，这场暴乱，就是妄图颠覆中华人民共和国，推翻共产党的领导，推翻社会主义制度。如果让他们的阴谋得逞，千百万革命先烈流血牺牲换来的共和国就会毁于一旦，我们的改革、开放和社会主义建设大业就会付之东流。党中央、国务院、中央军委，在关键时刻，采取果断措施平息暴乱，代表了全党和全国人民的根本利益，是完全正确的。我们坚信，在党中央的正确领导下，这场斗争一定能取得最后胜利。
    我们陕西省委、省政府、省军区将一如既往地同党中央保持高度一致，遵照党中央、国务院的指示，进一步做好陕西工作。要组织全省党员、干部认真学习《中共中央、国务院告全体党员和全国人民书》，充分认识这场斗争的极端严重性，统一思想，在大是大非面前站稳立场。要坚决揭露极少数人的阴谋活动和各种谣言，团结绝大多数人民群众和青年学生，旗帜鲜明地制止动乱。要坚决打击趁机搞打、砸、抢、烧破坏活动的不法之徒，保护人民生命财产的安全，稳定形势。全省共产党员和人民群众，决心团结在党中央的周围，把这场反动乱的斗争进行到底！

    当前，西藏的局势基本稳定。自贯彻李鹏、尚昆同志重要讲话精神以来，拉萨市区的戒严继续得到了有效的实施，学校照常上课，社会的生产、生活秩序正常。但我们也清醒地看到，国内外的分裂主义势力仍在加紧活动，他们企图寻机挑起事端，制造新的骚乱，我们绝不能丧失警惕。
    我们根据党中央的指示精神，作出了部署，要求全区广大共产党员继续认真学习中央领导同志的重要讲话和《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》，坚决做到在政治思想上、行动上和中央保持一致，切实发挥各级党组织的战斗堡垒作用和党员的模范带头作用；要求全区各族人民群众把思想统一到稳定局势这个大局上来，旗帜鲜明地反对动乱，不做任何不利于安定团结和局势稳定的事；要求广大职工继续坚守岗位，搞好各项工作，以实际行动维护安定团结，维护局势稳定；要求人民解放军驻藏部队和公安干警、武警部队进一步严格执勤，文明执勤，坚决贯彻拉萨戒严的各项措施；要求各级党政组织加强正面疏导和深入细致的思想政治工作，严格执行政策界限，密切注视社会动向，力争把工作做在前面，把问题解决在萌芽状态。同时，要坚定不移地贯彻“两手抓”的方针，为保卫祖国的西南边疆，为实现西藏局势的基本稳定，为完成今年的经济社会发展计划而努力奋斗。

    我们一定组织和动员全省广大共产党员和人民群众，共同做好稳定大局、稳定湖南的工作，以实际行动拥护党中央、国务院、中央军委的正确决策。为此，我们研究采取了以下措施：
    （一）加强正面宣传，耐心细致地做好思想政治工作。立即组织广大干部群众认真学习《中共中央、国务院告全体共产党员和全国人民书》，认真学习《解放军报》６月４日社论，学习李锡铭同志６月４日在北京市部、办、委干部会上的讲话，和袁木等同志６月６日在记者招待会上的讲话，了解事实真相，不信谣、不传谣。全体共产党员一定要坚定地和党中央保持一致，严守纪律，明辨是非，顾全大局，经受起这场政治斗争的考验，广大干部职工都要坚守岗位，努力搞好生产和工作，在稳定湖南、稳定大局中作出贡献。
    （二）各级各部门各单位的党政领导干部，要千方百计地做好本地区本部门本单位的稳定工作。当前，各种矛盾交织在一起，各级领导干部既要坚持原则，又要讲究方法，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，妥善处理好各种突发事件，尽力做好稳定群众情绪的工作。
    （三）加强要害部位的安全保卫工作，严防极少数不法分子趁机破坏。对继续打砸抢烧的犯罪分子坚决依法惩处，决不手软。
    （四）各级党政领导机关要组织两套班子，分工负责，全面安排，做好稳定局势和组织好工农业生产这两个方面的工作，保证建设和改革的顺利进行。

    党中央、国务院、中央军委：
    ６月４日晨，我们收听到《解放军报》《坚决拥护党中央决策，坚决镇压反革命暴乱》的社论和首都戒严部队平息反革命暴乱的消息后，省委书记何竹康同志主持召开了由省顾委、省人大常委会、省政府、省政协、省纪委、省军区的负责同志参加的常委扩大会议，进行了认真的讨论。与会同志一致认为，这次发生在首都的严重的反革命暴乱，是建国以来从未有过的，是一个时期以来极少数人阴谋制造动乱的恶性发展，是他们反对中国共产党的领导、企图颠覆社会主义制度罪恶目的的集中暴露。为了捍卫伟大的中华人民共和国，捍卫神圣的宪法，捍卫庄严的首都，党中央、国务院、中央军委果断作出决策，坚决镇压反革命暴乱，这完全是正义行动，完全符合首都人民和全国人民的根本利益。我们完全拥护和支持这一正确决策，并向为平息暴乱作出巨大贡献的北京戒严部队的指战员和武警官兵、公安干警，表示崇高的敬意和亲切的慰问。为夺取这场斗争的全胜，６月５日，中共中央、国务院发布了告全体共产党员和全国人民书，非常及时，极为重要，表达了全党和全国人民的心愿。我们完全相信党中央、国务院和中央军委，有力量有办法彻底平息这场暴乱。按照党中央和国务院的部署，我们从吉林省的实际出发，团结一致，努力工作，以稳定吉林的实际行动，为稳定全国的大局做出贡献。近日来，我们主要做了以下几个方面的工作：
    一、组织广大党员和群众认真学习《中共中央、国务院告全体共产党员和全国人民书》。省委首先召开了常委扩大会议进行学习，同时发出通知，要求全省各级党组织和政府认真学习，坚决贯彻执行。各地、各系统的党组织都立即行动，带领广大党员、干部按照党中央、国务院的要求去做，在政治上、思想上、行动上同党中央、国务院保持一致，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，严守纪律，坚守岗位，挺身而出，积极工作，与极少数阴谋制造动乱的人作坚决的斗争，维护安定团结的政治局面。
    二、加强宣传舆论引导。省和长春市的领导同志及有关部门，及时召开省和长春市部分劳动模范、工会干部、各界人士座谈会，并精心组织报道，宣传党中央的指示精神，反映广大群众的正义呼声，充分发挥大众传播工具的舆论导向作用，以事实真相帮助群众澄清模糊认识，揭露极少数人的阴谋，戳穿各种谣言，把思想统一到中央精神上来。
    三、切实抓好高校工作。继续坚持原则，坚持疏导，坚定地依靠高校的领导、党团组织、教师和学生骨干，进行耐心细致的思想和政治工作，严肃地指明这场斗争的性质，引导广大学生认真、冷静地思考问题，理智、正确地判断是非。要求高校严肃校规校纪，尽快恢复正常的教学秩序，坚决制止种种违纪、违法、破坏安定团结的行为。
    四、全面加强经济工作，稳定工厂和所有企业。各级党的组织和工会组织把广大职工充分动员起来，发挥工人阶级主力军作用，克服困难和不利因素，基本上坚持了正常生产。商业等有关部门千方百计搞好市场供应，安排好人民生活。同时，加强社会治安保卫，对少数打、砸、抢、烧、杀等制造动乱的敌对分子及时予以打击，从严惩处，以保持正常的工作、生产和生活秩序。
    五、进一步加强领导，充分发挥党组织的战斗堡垒作用和党员的先锋模范作用。各级党的组织加强了集体领导，凡属重大问题，都充分讨论，作出正确决策。各级党政领导都忠于职守，切实负责，上下一心，团结奋斗，把建设和改革继续推向前进。
    我们明确提出，当前是考验每一个党员、干部的关键时刻，要求广大党员、干部一定要认清形势，明辩是非，坚定地和党中央站在一起，旗帜鲜明地反对动乱，同一切阴谋制造动乱的敌对分子作坚决的斗争，为党和人民做出自己应有的贡献。

    根据《中共中央、国务院告全体共产党员和全国人民书》的精神，我们进一步分析了我省的局势，正在抓紧做好以下几项工作：
    一、认真组织党员干部群众学习《中共中央、国务院告全体共产党员和全国人民书》。我们已发出通知，要求各级党委和政府组织全体党员和广大群众认真学习，认清目前面临的严峻形势，认清北京严重反革命暴乱的真相，明辨是非，提高认识，团结一致，坚守岗位，努力搞好生产和工作。
    二、发挥党组织的战斗堡垒作用和党员的先锋模范作用。我们要求各级党组织在目前的情况下，始终站在第一线，敢于做工作，善于做工作，团结广大人民群众，为稳定江苏的局势，支持平息首都发生的反革命暴乱事件，稳定全国而努力奋斗。广大共产党员要在政治上同中央保持高度一致，旗帜鲜明地同极少数人制造动乱，反对党的领导，颠覆社会主义制度的阴谋作坚决的斗争。要严守纪律，以身作则，忠于职守，自觉地维护安定团结的政治局面。并教育好自己的子女和亲属，做好周围群众的工作。
    三、从江苏的实际出发，认真做好各方面的工作，努力稳定江苏的局势。最近一阶段，省委、省政府以及南京市委、市政府分别做了高校的工作、企事业单位的工作、机关干部的工作以及新闻舆论单位的工作，还注意及时向民主党派通报情况，动员各方面的力量，团结一致，同舟共济，努力稳定江苏的局势。对广大青年学生，要继续做好疏导教育工作，稳定情绪，保持理智，尽快回校复课，不要做出违背国家和人民利益的事情。对广大企事业单位职工，强调坚守生产岗位，努力做好本职工作，用增加生产的实际行动为稳定局势作出贡献。教育青年学生和广大群众不听信和传播谣言，不要进行任何形式的串联，不做不利于党和国家的事，不做亲者痛、仇者快的事，为稳定局势而努力创造良好的社会环境。
    四、努力维持正常的工作秩序、生产秩序和生活秩序。依靠广大干部群众，采取各种措施，保证各种交通设施特别是城市、铁路交通畅通；集中全力抓好市场供应，特别是人民生活必需品的供应；切实解决目前生产中的各种紧迫问题，为基层企业维持正常生产提供必要的条件。
    五、严防各种犯罪分子乘机进行破坏活动。我们对政法部门提出，越是在目前的情况下，越是要对各类犯罪活动保持高度的警惕，决不放松对他们的斗争，一旦发现有人乘机进行打砸抢烧、流氓、盗窃等犯罪活动，要采取果断措施，坚决依法从重从快予以打击。
