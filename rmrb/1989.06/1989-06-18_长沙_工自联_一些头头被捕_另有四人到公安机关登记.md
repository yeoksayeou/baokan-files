Changsha "工自联" Some Leaders Arrested
Four Others Register with the Public Security Bureau

Xinhua News Agency, Changsha, June 18th.

The reporter learned from a press conference held by the Changsha Public Security Bureau yesterday that by June 16th, six main leaders of the illegal organization "Changsha Workers' Autonomous Federation" had been arrested by the Changsha Public Security Bureau. Four leaders and key members of this illegal organization have registered with the Public Security Bureau.

The illegal organization "Changsha Workers' Autonomous Federation" was established illegally on May 20th at the suggestion of the main leaders of the illegal organization "Hunan Universities Students' Autonomous Federation." After its establishment, this illegal organization distributed a large number of reactionary leaflets, engaged in counter-revolutionary propaganda, incited workers to go on strike, stormed factories, and prevented workers from going to work. Its leaders and key members also repeatedly blocked traffic in Changsha. On June 4th, 5th, and 6th, they set up barricades at seven locations, causing Changsha's traffic to come to a complete standstill.

Recently, the Changsha Public Security Bureau has arrested the main leaders of the Changsha "工自联" Li Jia, He Zhaohui, Lu Zhexing, Zhang Xudong, Zhou Yong, and Liu Xiqing. After the Changsha Municipal Government issued a notice on June 12th to disband the Hunan "高自联" and Changsha "工自联," four leaders and key members of the Changsha "工自联," Zhou Min, Wang Changhuai, Cai Jinxuan, and Li Jie, have registered with the Changsha Public Security Bureau.

    本报长沙６月１８日电  记者吴兴华报道：记者从湖南省长沙市公安局昨天举行的新闻发布会上获悉：到６月１６日止，长沙市的非法组织“长沙市工人联合自治会”的６名主要头头已被长沙市公安机关拘捕，该非法组织的４名头头和骨干分子已到公安机关进行了登记。
    非法组织“长沙市工人联合自治会”，是５月２０日在非法组织“湖南高校学生自治联合会”的主要头头的提议下非法成立的。该非法组织成立后，大量散发反动传单，进行反革命宣传，煽动工人罢工，冲击工厂，阻止工人上班。其头头和骨干还多次在长沙阻塞交通，其中６月４日、５日、６日三天在７处设置路障，使长沙交通全部瘫痪。
    日前，长沙市公安机关已将长沙“工自联”主要头头李枧、何朝辉、卢摘星、张旭东、周勇、柳星期拘捕。长沙市人民政府６月１２日发出取缔湖南“高自联”、长沙“工自联”的《通告》后，长沙“工自联”的头头和骨干分子周敏、王长怀、蔡瑾璇、李杰等４人已到长沙市公安机关进行了登记。
