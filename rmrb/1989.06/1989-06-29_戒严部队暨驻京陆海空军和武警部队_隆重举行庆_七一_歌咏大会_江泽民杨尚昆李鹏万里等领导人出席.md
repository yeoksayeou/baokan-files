Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 29th.

The golden sickle and hammer shone brilliantly under the red flags, and the words "The People's Army is Loyal to the Party" stood out vividly against the backdrop of flowers. This afternoon, the Beijing Martial Law Troops and the Beijing-based Army, Navy, Air Force, and Armed Police held a grand singing festival to celebrate the 71st anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China (CPC) at the Beijing Air Force Stadium. Jiang Zemin, Yang Shangkun, Li Peng, Wan Li, Qiao Shi, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, Li Ruihuan, and Wang Zhen attended the festival.

At 3:30 PM, the festival began with the solemn national anthem and military songs. The entire audience stood and sang "The People's Army is Loyal to the Party," setting the festival's passionate and uplifting tone. On both sides of the stage were large banners reading, "Firmly Support the Decisions of the Fourth Plenary Session, Make New Contributions to the Long-Term Stability and Prosperity of the Country and the Four Modernizations!" and "Tightly Unite Around the Party Central Committee, Achieve a Complete Victory in Suppressing the Counter-Revolutionary Rebellion!"

The martial law troops, dressed in full military gear and standing tall, sang powerful and majestic songs such as "The August First Flag Flies High," "The People's Army Marches On," "Song of the Soldiers," "Song of the Armed Police," and "I Carry the Gun for the People." Their heartfelt and resonant voices expressed the People's Liberation Army's unwavering loyalty to the Party and the country, and their dedication to serving the people.

Professional artists from the military and armed police, including Ma Yutao, Ma Guoguang, Dong Wenhua, Kelimu, Yang Hongji, and Zhang Baomo, performed their best pieces. Songs like "Party, I Want to Call You Mother," "The Country is Good, the Party is Dearest," and "Ode to the Dear Party" evoked thunderous applause from the audience.

Interspersed throughout the festival were performances by the military band of the People's Liberation Army, the naval band, and the armed police band. The marching performances, accompanied by stirring military music, showcased the disciplined and orderly nature of the troops, embodying the image of a powerful and civilized army.

In the end, the Party and state leaders joined the entire audience in singing "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China." This song reminded everyone of the CPC's 68-year glorious history, recalling how the Party had paved the way to a bright and happy future, and erected towering monuments of truth. This historical echo had long resonated in the hearts of the people, expressing the shared aspirations of all military personnel.

Other leaders present at the festival included Li Ximing, Qin Jiwei, Song Renqiong, Hong Xuezhi, Liu Huaqing, Chi Haotian, Yang Baibing, and Zhao Nanqi.

The festival concluded with the rousing "The Internationale."
