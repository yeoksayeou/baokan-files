The category of practice not only has epistemological significance but also ontological significance, a point that is increasingly recognized by more people. Some people believe that, unlike the "natural ontology" advocated by old materialism, the ontology of Marxist philosophy is essentially a "practical ontology" or "practical monism." The author believes that this proposition is tenable. The question is how to understand the proposition of "practical ontology" or "practical monism."

Recently, a representative opinion holds that the "element" in practice does not have the connotation of being the "source of all things." It only manifests as the logical starting point of philosophy and as the axis of Marxist philosophical thinking. The author believes that this opinion clearly contradicts the principle established by Marx himself, that logic should be unified with history. Indeed, the category of practice is the axis of Marxist philosophical thinking and the starting point of the logical structure of Marxist philosophy. But as the logical starting point, is practice not first of all a historical starting point? If it is not first of all a historical starting point, how can it become a logical starting point? The author believes that the reason "practical ontology" can be established is primarily that, from a historical perspective or from the perspective of genesis, it indeed has the connotation of being the "source of all things." Because the entire sensory world we face is a derivative of human historical practice. This is not only manifested in the fact that the natural substances we face are no longer primitive natural substances but are substances that have been transformed by human labor or practice, bearing the imprint of human essence, and appearing as the results and products of human historical practice; it is also manifested in the fact that human history is nothing more than history created and generated through their own labor or practice. Without the creative activity of human practice, there would be no "historical nature and natural history," and without practice, there would be no human society and the history of human society. As Marx once pointed out: "This activity, this continuous sensory labor and creation, this production, is the extremely profound foundation of the entire existing sensory world." (Selected Works of Marx and Engels, Vol. 1, p. 49) Precisely because human labor and practical activities are the profound foundation of the entire existing sensory world, the history of the development of human labor is the key to understanding the secrets of the entire human history, so the Marxist philosophy that understands things according to their true nature and their genesis takes the category of practice as its logical starting point.

The establishment of practical materialism is simultaneously the establishment of human subjectivity in the sensory world, the establishment of human subjectivity in Marxist philosophy, or the establishment of the principle of subjectivity in philosophy. Of course, the concepts of subjectivity and the principle of subjectivity should not be understood in the way some people do—equating subjectivity and the principle of subjectivity with subjective initiative or the principle of initiative. The subject is relative to the object, and the proof of subjectivity cannot be separated from the object. Since practical materialism understands human sensory activity as the profound foundation of the entire sensory world and understands the entire sensory world as the result or work of human sensory activity, the position of humans as the subject of practice is naturally established, and human subjectivity is confirmed or reflected in the objects or works created by humans themselves. Following the path of practical materialism, people will gain a completely new philosophical perspective. In their eyes, Marxist philosophy will no longer be a philosophy without a subject. What is presented to people is that humans are not only the subjects of humanized natural substances but also the subjects of the society and history they create. Especially in the historical view, categories such as productive forces and productive relations will no longer be things unrelated to human activities. Productive forces manifest as "subjective productive forces," and productive relations are also the productive relations of historical subjects.

In practical materialism, the establishment of the principle of subjectivity negates the narrow understanding of the category of labor. In a narrow sense, labor is understood as activity and mediation, that is, labor is the activity and mediation of the interaction between humans and nature, excluding the elements of labor (such as nature itself). In his article "The Role of Labor in the Transition from Ape to Human," Engels says: "Economists say: labor is the source of all wealth, in fact, labor and nature together are the source of all wealth. Nature provides the material, and labor transforms the material into wealth." Here, Engels understands the category of labor in a narrow sense, excluding nature itself. At this point, labor and nature together are the origin of the world. In a broad sense, the category of labor is understood as the unity of activity and elements, as a dynamic system formed by the combination of the three elements of laborers, means of labor, and objects of labor, including the elements of labor themselves, and including nature as the object of labor. Practical ontology understands the category of labor in a broad sense, including nature as the object of labor within the category of labor. Therefore, practical ontology critically absorbs the rational part of natural ontology while surpassing and overcoming the historical limitations of natural ontology.

Marx's practical ontology is a highly unified dialectical and materialist ontology. Marx believes that labor practice humanizes nature, imprints human thought and will on it, and brings about tremendous changes in nature, which is the dialectical ontology. However, the tremendous changes in nature brought about by the creative role of human practice can only change the state, structure, and nature of natural substances but cannot change the objective reality of natural substances. Humanized nature still maintains a prior position, which is the materialist ontology. Thus, the dialectical ontology and the materialist ontology are unified on the basis of Marx's practical view.

Engels proposed: "Spinoza: Substance is the cause of itself—clearly shows mutual action." He also said: "Ultimate cause—matter and its inherent motion." (See Dialectics of Nature, pp. 209, 221, 1971 edition) Spinoza's view that "substance is the cause of itself" is not only materialist but also dialectical, but Spinoza's materialist and dialectical view of nature is very incomplete. Because in the real world, material objects and spiritual subjects interact with each other through practice, therefore, the cause of the development of material objects (including natural objects) lies not only in the mutual action of material objects themselves, the inherent laws of motion of material objects themselves, but also in the active transformation of subjects (humans) on material objects, causing material objects to undergo tremendous changes. Therefore, a thorough materialist and dialectical view of nature must not only see the causes of material objects themselves but also see the mutual action of material objects and subjects (humans), the active transformation of subjects (humans) on material objects in practice. Therefore, without the view of practice, it is impossible to establish a truly materialist and dialectical view of nature, and a view of nature without the view of practice is ultimately incomplete, while the practical view of nature is a thorough materialist and dialectical view of nature, because practical materialism, on the one hand, acknowledges the prior position of nature, the mutual action of nature itself, and the inherent laws of motion of nature, and on the other hand, acknowledges the tremendous transformative role of human practice on nature.

Marx's epoch-making contribution is not only to introduce practice into epistemology but also into ontology, not only into the historical view but also into the natural view, thereby establishing a new materialist philosophical system with the category of practice as its core. The category of practice runs through the entire system of Marxist philosophy. Its logical starting point is labor, which creates the world. Its ontology is practical ontology, studying the real world created by practice; its natural view is the practical natural view, studying humanized nature; its historical view is the practical historical view, studying human society; its epistemology is practical epistemology, studying the subjectivity, structure, and cognition of humans; its logical endpoint is the realm of freedom. Human practice will create the realm of freedom in a communist society. The logical structure of the practical materialist system should follow the principle of the unity of logic and history, unfolding along the line of the generation, development, and negation of the negation of the contradiction between subject and object in practice. Practical materialism is a Marxist philosophical system composed of practical ontology, practical natural view, practical historical view, and practical epistemology. Whether it is ontology and epistemology, natural view and historical view, they are all materialism and dialectics in high unity on the basis of the view of practice.

　　实践唯物主义与人的主体性
    林剑
    实践范畴不仅具有认识论的意义，而且具有本体论的意义，这一点已为越来越多的人认识到。有人认为，与旧唯物主义主张的“自然本体论”不同，马克思主义哲学的本体论实质上是一种“实践本体论”或“实践一元论”。笔者认为这种提法是能够成立的。问题是对“实践本体论”或“实践一元论”的提法作何种理解。
    近来，一种有代表性的意见认为，实践之“元”不具有“万物本源”的涵义，它只表现为哲学的逻辑起点，表现为马克思哲学思维辐射的轴心。笔者认为这种意见明显地违悖了马克思本人确立的逻辑应与历史相统一的原则。不错，实践范畴确实是马克思哲学思维辐射的轴心，并且是马克思主义哲学逻辑构造的起点。但这作为逻辑起点的实践难道不首先是历史的起点吗？如果它不首先是历史的起点，又何以能成为逻辑的起点呢？笔者认为，“实践本体论”之所以能够成立，首要的根据在于，从历史的角度看，或者从发生学的意义上看，确有“万物本源”的涵义。因为，我们所面对的整个感性世界都是人的历史实践的派生物。这不仅表现在，我们所面对的自然物质，已经不是原始的自然物，而是经过人类劳动或实践改造过的，打上了人的本质力量印迹的人化自然物，表现为人的历史实践的结果和产物；而且也表现在，人类的历史也不过是通过自己的劳动或实践而创造与生成的历史。没有人的实践活动的创造就没有“历史的自然和自然的历史”，没有实践更没有人类社会和人类社会的历史。正如马克思曾经指出的：“这种活动，这种连续不断的感性劳动和创造，这种生产，是整个现存感性世界的非常深刻的基础。”（《马克思恩格斯选集》第１卷，第４９页）正因为人的劳动、实践活动是整个现存感性世界的深刻的基础，人类劳动发展史是理解整个人类历史奥秘的一把钥匙，所以，“按照事物的本来面目及其产生情况来理解事物”的马克思主义哲学才把实践范畴作为自己的逻辑出发点。
    实践唯物主义的创立，同时也就是人在感性世界中主体性的确立，也就是人在马克思主义哲学中的主体地位的确立，或者说是哲学的主体性原则的确立。当然，对主体性、主体性原则等概念不能作某些人那样的理解——把主体性、主体性原则与主观能动性或能动性原则划等号。主体是相对于客体而言的，主体性的证明也不能离开客体。既然实践唯物主义把人的感性活动理解为全部感性世界的深刻基础，而把全部感性世界理解为人的感性活动的结果或作品，那么作为实践主体的人的地位便自然而然地得到了确立，人的主体性也就在人自己创造的客体或作品中得到确证或反思。循着实践唯物主义的思路前进，人们获得的将是一个全新的哲学视角，在人们眼里，马克思主义哲学将不再是一个无主体的哲学。展现在人们眼前的，人不仅是人化自然物的主体，人也是自己创造的社会与历史的主体。特别是在历史观中，生产力、生产关系等范畴将不再是与人的活动无关的东西，生产力表现为“主体的生产力”，生产关系也是历史主体的生产关系。
    在实践唯物主义中，主体性原则的确立，扬弃，它对劳动范畴作广义的理解。从狭义讲，把劳动理解为活动和中介，即劳动是人和自然界交互作用的活动和中介，不包括劳动要素（如自然界）本身。恩格斯在《劳动在从猿到人转变过程中的作用》一文中说：“政治经济学家说：劳动是一切财富的源泉，其实劳动和自然界一起才是一切财富的源泉，自然界为劳动提供材料，劳动把材料变为财富。”在这里，恩格斯对劳动范畴作狭义的理解，劳动范畴不包括自然界在内，这时，劳动和自然界一起才是世界的本原。从广义讲，把劳动范畴理解为活动和要素的统一，理解为由劳动者、劳动资料和劳动对象三要素结合而成的动态系统，把劳动要素本身也包括在内，把自然界作为劳动对象包括在其中。实践本体论对劳动范畴作广义的理解，把自然界作为劳动对象包括在劳动范畴之中。因此，实践本体论既批判地吸取了自然本体论的合理部分，又超越和克服了自然本体论的历史局限性。
    马克思的实践本体论是辩证法和唯物论的高度统一。马克思认为，劳动实践使自然界人化了，被打上了人类思维和意志的印记，引起了自然界的巨大变化，这就是本体论的辩证法。然而，人类实践的创造作用所引起的自然界的巨大变化，只能改变自然界事物的状态、结构和性质，不能改变自然界事物的客观实在性，人化的自然界仍保持着优先的地位，这就是本体论的唯物论。这样，本体论的辩证法和本体论的唯物论在马克思的实践观基础上统一了起来。
    恩格斯提出：“斯宾诺莎：实体是自身原因——把相互作用明显地表现出来了”。又说：“终极的原因——物质及其固有的运动。”（见《自然辩证法》第２０９、２２１页，１９７１年版）斯宾诺莎的“实体是自身原因”的观点，不但是唯物的，而且又是辩证的，但斯宾诺莎的这种唯物而辩证的自然观是很不彻底的。因为在现实世界中，物质客体和精神主体通过实践而相互作用着，因此，物质客体（包括自然客体）的发展的原因，不仅在于物质客体自身的相互作用，物质客体自身固有的运动规律，而且在于主体（人）对物质客体的能动的改造作用，使物质客体发生巨大的变化。因此，彻底的唯物而辩证的自然观，不仅要看到物质客体自身的原因，而且要看到物质客体和主体（人）的相互作用，主体（人）在实践中对物质客体的能动的改造作用。因此，离开实践观不可能建立真正的唯物而辩证的自然观，离开了实践观的自然观终究是不彻底的，而实践自然观才是彻底的唯物而辩证的自然观，因为实践唯物主义一方面承认自然界的优先地位、自然界自身的相互作用和固有的运动规律，另一方面又承认人类实践对自然界的巨大的改造作用。
    马克思的划时代的贡献，不仅把实践引入了认识论，而且引入了本体论，不仅引入了历史观，而且引入了自然观，从而建立起以实践范畴为核心的唯物主义哲学新体系，实践范畴贯穿于马克思主义哲学体系的始终。它的逻辑起点是劳动，劳动创造了世界，它的本体论是实践本体论，研究对象是实践创造的现实世界；它的自然观是实践自然观，研究对象是人化自然；它的历史观是实践历史观，研究对象是人类社会；它的认识论是实践认识论，研究对象是人的主体特性、结构和认识；它的逻辑终点是自由王国。人类实践将创造共产主义社会的自由王国。实践唯物主义体系的逻辑结构应遵循逻辑与历史相统一的原则，按在实践中主客体矛盾生成、主客体矛盾发展和主客体矛盾统一的否定之否定的线索展开。实践唯物主义是由实践本体论、实践自然观、实践历史观和实践认识论所组成的马克思主义哲学体系，无论是本体论和认识论、自然观和历史观都是在实践观基础上的唯物论和辩证法的高度统一。
