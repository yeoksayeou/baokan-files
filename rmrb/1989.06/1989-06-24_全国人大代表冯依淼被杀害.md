National People's Congress Representative Feng Yimiao, General Manager and Party Secretary of the Dongjiekou Department Store (Group) Co., Ltd. in Fuzhou, was unfortunately murdered by a criminal on the morning of June 15th in Yong'an, Fujian. A memorial service for Comrade Feng Yimiao was held in Fuzhou today. Minister of Commerce Hu Ping, Secretary of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee Chen Guangyi, Governor Wang Zhaoguo, and representatives from the Provincial Party Committee, Provincial Government, Provincial People's Congress, Provincial Political Consultative Conference, and Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission sent wreaths.

Vice Mayor Liu Wenpeng of Fuzhou said in his eulogy that Feng Yimiao was 38 years old. She had worked in the countryside and was transferred back to Fuzhou in December 1974, where she had been working in the commercial sector ever since. She was politically aligned with the Central Committee, worked hard to build the business, explored boldly, and served the public with integrity. She was an outstanding female entrepreneur. During the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, she remained steadfast in her stance, actively organizing company employees to study the series of important instructions from the Party Central Committee and the State Council on opposing the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, as well as the important speeches by Comrade Deng Xiaoping. At the same time, she urged everyone to stay at their posts and do a good job in supply work to stabilize the market and people's minds. The case of Feng Yimiao's murder is currently under investigation.
