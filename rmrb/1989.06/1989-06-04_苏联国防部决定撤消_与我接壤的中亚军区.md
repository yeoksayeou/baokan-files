The Soviet Defense Ministry has decided to dissolve the Central Asian Military District from June 1.

According to a report by TASS today, some of the units and troops of this military district will be disbanded, while others will be transferred to the Turkestan Military District.

Lieutenant General Petrov, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Armed Forces, told TASS reporters that the decision to dissolve the Central Asian Military District is related to the Soviet government's decision to reduce the military by 500,000 personnel. The Soviet Union originally had 16 military districts. The Central Asian Military District, established in the late 1960s, is adjacent to China's Xinjiang region.
