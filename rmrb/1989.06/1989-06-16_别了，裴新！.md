The Voice of America correspondent in Beijing, Pei Xin, was ordered by the Beijing Municipal Government Foreign Affairs Office to leave China within 72 hours at 4:30 PM on June 14. Today is the last day of the deadline. During the period when martial law was partially implemented in some areas of Beijing, Pei Xin blatantly violated the third order issued by the Beijing Municipal Government, engaging in illegal reporting activities. He conducted a large amount of reporting that distorted the facts, spread rumors, incited, and instigated turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots. Therefore, Pei Xin was ordered to leave China, which was a self-inflicted consequence and a deserved punishment.

Throughout the entire process of turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, the Voice of America played a very unflattering role, from distorting and exaggerating, spreading rumors and slanders, to fanning the flames of counter-revolutionary riots. Pei Xin had a significant part in this. However, rumors have short legs, and when people exposed the truth, the Voice of America's unflattering face was also exposed. For example, when the Chinese martial law troops achieved an initial victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots and Beijing began to restore normal order, the Voice of America, fearing that the situation was not chaotic enough, spread rumors saying, "There are power struggles between troops loyal to different factions"; "Beijing might experience a civil war." However, the development of facts gave the Voice of America a hard slap. For instance, Beijing University, based on student reports, handed over some criminals from other provinces who had committed crimes in the university to the public security authorities for processing. This was a normal action taken to maintain campus order, but the Voice of America saw this as an opportunity to sensationalize and spread the rumor that "police entered Beijing University at night and took away about 12 students." The Voice of America did not limit its rumor-mongering to Beijing but also directed its rumor machine towards the entire country. For example, it fabricated the rumor that "the textile factories in the Xian Textile City, including the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Cotton Mills, have all gone on strike." Naturally, it was also strongly refuted by the workers of these factories. People cannot help but ask, what is the Voice of America's intention in spreading so many rumors?

According to a report by the Associated Press on the 12th, after the Voice of America's tricks were exposed by the relevant authorities and the masses, Pei Xin, as the responsible person for the Voice of America's Beijing office and a reporter, had to admit helplessly but lightly, "The Voice of America has made some honest mistakes in its reports over the past few weeks." What an "honest mistake"! We ask, how can there be honesty in a web of lies? Pei Xin also defended himself, saying, "The Voice of America does not report rumors. We have no ulterior motives; we do not engage in spreading rumors." This is strange. The lies mentioned above, fabricated by the Voice of America, are not rumors, then what are they?

The Voice of America is an official news agency of the United States, which has always claimed to be "objective and fair" and to "uphold journalistic ethics." It should understand that "truthfulness" is the lifeblood of news reporting. If news reporting is done arbitrarily and with ulterior motives, exaggerating and sensationalizing, spreading alarmist statements, and even distorting facts and fabricating lies, then what honesty is there to speak of?

Regarding the exposure and refutation by the relevant authorities in China of the Voice of America, Pei Xin had some complaints, believing that this would put pressure on the Voice of America to report on the situation in China, making him feel "uneasy." We hereby inform Mr. Pei Xin that as long as the mass media adheres to the facts, upholds journalistic ethics, respects China's relevant laws and regulations, and conducts normal news reporting, there is no need to feel any "pressure" or "unease." Otherwise, if one persists in spreading rumors and misleading the public, it is only natural that one will be unacceptable to the Chinese people.

The deadline is approaching, and Pei Xin is about to return to his country, possibly already on his way. Other reporters from the Voice of America will continue to work in China. We hope that the Voice of America will not do things that violate journalistic ethics and harm the relationship between the two countries. Pei Xin is gone, and we hope that his successors will think carefully.

　　别了，裴新！
    晓坚
    《美国之音》驻北京记者裴新，于６月１４日下午４时半被北京市人民政府外事办公室限令在７２小时内离开中国。今天是限期的最后一天。裴新在北京部分地区实行戒严期间，公然违反北京市人民政府发布的第三号令，非法从事采访活动，进行了大量歪曲事实真相、造谣、挑唆、煽动动乱和反革命暴乱的报道。因此，裴新被限期离开中国，咎由自取，罪有应得。
    在北京发生动乱以至反革命暴乱的整个过程中，《美国之音》扮演了很不光采的角色，从歪曲渲染、造谣诬蔑，直到为反革命暴乱推波助澜，可谓使尽浑身解数。这其中，就有裴新的“功劳”。但是，谣言毕竟腿短，当人们揭穿事实真相，《美国之音》极不光采的嘴脸也就暴露无遗了。比如，当中国戒严部队一举取得平息反革命暴乱初步胜利，北京开始恢复正常秩序之际，“美国之音”却唯恐天下不乱，大肆造谣说什么“在忠于不同派系的军队之间，也发生了权力斗争”；“北京可能发生内战”。然而，事实的发展，给《美国之音》狠狠打了一记耳光。又比如，北京大学根据学生的检举，把一些在北大作案的外地流窜人员交由公安部门处理，这本是为维护校园秩序而采取的正常行动，而《美国之音》对此却视为可乘之机，耸人听闻地造谣“警察晚上进入北京大学，带走约１２名学生”。《美国之音》不以对北京地区造谣为满足，还把造谣机器对向全中国。例如，它还编造了“西安纺织城地区国棉三、四、五、六厂已全面罢工”的谣言。理所当然，它同样遭到这些工厂工人的严词驳斥。人们不禁要问，《美国之音》如此起劲地散布流言蜚语，意欲何为？！
    据合众国际社１２日报道，当《美国之音》的伎俩被有关方面和人民群众揭穿后，作为《美国之音》驻北京办事处负责人和记者的裴新，只好无可奈何但却轻描淡写地承认：“《美国之音》在过去几周的报道中，也曾犯过一些诚实的错误”。好一个“诚实的错误”！试问，谎言连篇，何诚实之有？！裴新还辩解说，“《美国之音》并不报道谣言。我们没有别的用心，我们不从事制造谣言。”这就怪了，以上所举《美国之音》如此无中生有的谎话，不是谣言，又是什么？！
    《美国之音》是美国官方的新闻机构，一向自诩“客观公正”，“恪守新闻道德”，它理应懂得“真实性”是新闻报道的生命。如果在新闻报道中随心所欲，别有用心地渲染夸大，危言耸听，甚至不惜歪曲事实，无中生有，那又有何“诚实”可言。
    对于我国有关方面对《美国之音》进行的揭露和批驳，裴新不无抱怨，认为这使《美国之音》今后“对报道中国事态形成一些压力”，从而“感到不安”。我们在此奉告裴新先生，作为大众传播媒介，只要实事求是，恪守新闻道德，尊重中国有关法律和规定，进行正常的新闻报道，那就不必感到有何“压力”和“不安”。否则，一味造谣惑众，就理所当然地为中国人民所不容。
    限期即至，裴新行将返国，可能正在途中。《美国之音》其他记者仍将在中国工作。我们希望《美国之音》不要做违背新闻道德和有损两国关系的事情。裴新去了，望继之者三思。
