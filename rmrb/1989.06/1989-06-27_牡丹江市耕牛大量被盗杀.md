Over the past year, numerous draft cattle have been stolen and slaughtered in various counties of our city. In particular, the number of draft cattle theft and slaughter cases in Linkou County has increased threefold compared to the previous year. Out of the 10,300 cowhides purchased by the county's local products company, 3,400 do not comply with the procedures for slaughtering draft cattle.

The primary reasons for the large-scale theft and slaughter of draft cattle are as follows: First, some farmers do not properly guard their own draft cattle, providing opportunities for criminals; second, individual butchers are poorly managed. For example, in Linkou County's Zhujia Town, five butchers slaughtered over 100 draft cattle last year without any slaughter permits; third, there is insufficient crackdown on criminals involved in the theft and slaughter of draft cattle, with a tendency to substitute emotion for law and fines for criminal penalties.

It is suggested that relevant departments take measures to stop the theft and slaughter of draft cattle.

　　牡丹江市耕牛大量被盗杀
    去年以来，我市各县大量耕牛被盗杀，其中林口县耕牛盗杀案比上年增长３倍，县土产公司收购的１０３００张牛皮中，有３４００张是不符合屠宰耕牛手续的。耕牛被大量盗杀的主要原因，一是部分农民对自家耕牛看管不严，使作案分子有机可乘；二是对于个体屠户管理不善，林口县朱家镇５名屠户去年宰耕牛１００多头，均无屠宰证明；三是对盗杀耕牛的犯罪分子打击不力，存在着以情代法，以罚代刑的倾向。建议有关部门采取措施，制止盗杀耕牛的现象。
