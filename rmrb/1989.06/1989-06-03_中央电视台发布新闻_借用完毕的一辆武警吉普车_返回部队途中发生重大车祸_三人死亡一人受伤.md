Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 3rd.

Central Television held a press conference this afternoon to release the following news:

At 10:55 PM on June 2nd, a Mitsubishi Jeep borrowed by the Central Television 40th Anniversary Production Team from the Military Police Beijing Garrison's Fifth Detachment was involved in a major accident on its way back to the unit, resulting in three deaths and one injury.

To celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, Central Television plans to produce a large-scale series. The production team has been borrowing a Mitsubishi Jeep (license plate number 31WJ—1525) from the Military Police Beijing Garrison's Fifth Detachment since last July. The driver is Chen Fuyu. The vehicle has been working with the production team for 11 months, traveling to more than 10 provinces and cities for filming. After completing the filming tasks, arrangements were made with the unit for its return.

On the afternoon of June 2nd, the production team presented souvenirs to Chen and completed the handover of work. At 10:30 PM, four members of the production team and two hotel service staff saw him off as he boarded the vehicle, carrying his personal belongings back to the eastern suburb base. Before departing, the comrades reminded him to be careful on the road.

The vehicle was traveling from west to east when it reached east of Muzhidi. Due to high speed and the fact that a water truck had just sprayed water on the road, the tires skidded, causing the vehicle to veer to the right. The driver quickly turned the wheel to the left, but it did not respond, and in the out-of-control state, it collided with the south side barrier, crossed the slow lane, and overturned to the south side of the road, hitting four pedestrians who were traveling normally at the time, three of whom died despite rescue efforts. The driver, Chen Fuyu, has been detained by the Xicheng Public Security Bureau.

    借用完毕的一辆武警吉普车
    返回部队途中发生重大车祸三人死亡一人受伤
    新华社北京6月3日电　中央电视台今天下午举行记者招待会，发布新闻如下：
    6月2日晚10时55分，中央电视台建国四十年摄制组借用完毕的一辆三菱吉普车返回部队途中发生重大车祸，造成3人死亡1人受伤。
    为庆祝建国四十周年，中央电视台计划摄制一部大型系列片。这个摄制组从去年7月起向武警北京总队五支队借用三菱吉普车一辆，车号31WJ—1525，驾驶员陈福玉。此车与摄制组一起工作11个月，曾到10余个省市拍片。完成拍摄任务后，与部队商定返回。
    6月2日下午，摄制组向他赠送纪念品，并将工作交接完毕。晚上10时半，摄制组四位同志以及两位招待所服务员一起送他上车，随车携带他个人生活物品返回东郊驻地。行前同志们叮嘱他路上注意安全。
    此车由西往东行到木樨地以东时，由于速度快，加之前面洒水车刚洒过水，车轮打滑，冲向右侧，司机急向左打轮，没有打过来，在失控情况下撞倒南侧隔离墩，通过慢车道，翻至南侧马路边上，把当时正常行驶的四名群众撞伤，其中三人因抢救无效死亡，司机陈福玉已被西城公安分局拘留。
