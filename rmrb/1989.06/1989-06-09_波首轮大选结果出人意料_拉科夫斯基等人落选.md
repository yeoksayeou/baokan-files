    The results of the first round of elections for Poland's parliament and senate, held on June 4, were surprising. According to materials released today by the Polish National Election Commission, Prime Minister Rakowski, Interior Minister Kiszczak, and Defense Minister Siwicki, among others, failed to secure more than half of the valid votes and thus did not win their seats.

    They were originally candidates on the "National List," which was jointly proposed by the three alliance parties (Polish United Workers' Party, United Peasants' Party, and Democratic Party) and three secular religious organizations within the ruling coalition. The list included 35 parliamentary candidates, all of whom were key figures in their respective parties. Out of these 35, only the President of the Supreme Administrative Court and member of the Polish United Workers' Party, Jerzy Jędrzejewski, and the member of the United Peasants' Party, Kazimierz Kozakiewicz, were elected.

    Polish party leaders admitted that the results of this parliamentary election were unfavorable for the party and the entire ruling coalition, while Solidarity gained a "victory."

    According to the Round Table Agreement, the constructive opposition in the new parliament will occupy 35% of the 460 seats, or 161 seats. Most of Solidarity's candidates have secured more than half of the valid votes and thus won their seats. Those who have not yet won also have a relatively high number of votes and have the right to participate in the second round of elections. At the same time as this parliamentary election, a senate election was also held according to the constitutional amendment, with 100 seats distributed among the provinces, all of which are freely contested. The election results show that Solidarity has already won 92 seats. The remaining 8 seats, where no candidate secured more than half of the valid votes, will also be decided in the second round of elections.

　　波首轮大选结果出人意料
    拉科夫斯基等人落选
    新华社华沙６月８日电  （记者董福生）波兰议会和参议院４日举行的第一轮大选结果出人意料。据波兰国家选举委员会今天公布的材料，波政府总理拉科夫斯基、内务部长基什查克、国防部长西维茨基等人均未能获得超半数的有效票而落选。
    他们原属“国家名单”中的议员候选人，这个名单是由执政联盟中三个联盟党（波兰统一工人党、统一农民党、民主党）和三个世俗宗教组织共同协商提出的。名单中共有３５名议员候选人，均为各党的重要活动家。这３５人中，只有最高行政法院院长、波兰统一工人党党员杰林斯基和统一农民党党员科扎凯维奇二人当选。
    波党领导人承认，这次议会大选的结果对波党和整个执政联盟是不利的，团结工会方面取得了“胜利”。
    按圆桌会议规定，建设性反对派在新议会的４６０个席位中将占有３５％，即１６１个席位。团结工会的候选人绝大多数已赢得超半数以上的有效票而当选。少数尚未当选者也属得票相对较多者，有权进入第二轮选举。在这次议会大选的同时，也进行了按宪法修正案规定新设立的参议院选举。参议院的１００个席位分到各省，全部实行自由竞选。选举结果表明，团结工会方面已经赢得９２个席位。其余８个席位因无人获得超半数的有效票也将在第二轮选举中决出结果。
