Since the early hours of June 3, a serious counter-revolutionary rebellion has occurred in the capital. A group of troublemakers have spread rumors, incited some people to set up illegal checkpoints, attacked, beaten, and kidnapped soldiers, killed and injured our cadres and soldiers, smashed and burned military vehicles, looted weapons and ammunition, and stormed Zhongnanhai, the Great Hall of the People, looted stores, and set buildings on fire. The shocking rebellion that took place in the capital is unprecedented since the founding of the nation. It is the malignant development of a plot to create turmoil by a small number of people over a period of time, and it is the concentrated exposure of their evil intentions to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system. To defend the great People's Republic of China, to defend the sacred Constitution, and to defend the solemn capital, the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission quickly made the decision to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion. The martial law troops, along with the capital's public security personnel and the armed police, took decisive measures with an unyielding and fearless spirit, quickly quelling the rebellion. This is a great victory in the struggle to stop the turmoil and maintain the stability and unity of the capital and the country.

Some of our military units have been ordered to enter certain areas of Beijing to carry out martial law duties. Over the past half month, they have done a great deal of painstaking work to stop the turmoil and maintain social order in the capital. They have acted with the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, being a powerful and civilized army, gradually winning the understanding and support of the people of all walks of life in the capital, including the students. However, a group of criminals, unwilling to accept their failure, have been stirring up trouble everywhere, using various despicable methods to create incidents and expand the turmoil, which has reached an intolerable level. Without severe punishment for these law-breaking criminals, there would be no rule of law, no social order, and no stable and united situation! Facing the reactionary arrogance of the criminals, the broad masses of cadres and soldiers of the martial law troops have remembered the trust of the Party and the people, carried forward the "five revolutionary spirits" advocated by Chairman Deng, and once again achieved great historical merit at a critical moment when the fate of the Party and the state is seriously threatened. Their actions have powerfully proven that our army is reliable and trustworthy in critical moments, deserving to be the strong defender of the people's interests and the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat!

After the martial law troops entered the city, they will resolutely carry out their duties according to the martial law order of the State Council and the order of the Beijing Municipal People's Government. Undoubtedly, we will continue to love the capital, love the people of the capital, love the young students, and strive to protect the important targets of the capital, maintain the production, study, work, and life order of the capital, and protect the safety of people's lives and property to the best of our ability. For those who continue to plot rebellions, disrupt public order, and engage in beating, smashing, looting, and burning, we will assist the public security personnel and the armed police in severely punishing them and will not be lenient! We hope and believe that the broad masses of citizens and young students will actively assist the cadres and soldiers of the troops to complete the martial law duties, so that the normal order of the capital can be restored as soon as possible.

Comrades of all the cadres and soldiers of the martial law troops, the people of the capital are looking to us, and the people of the whole country are expecting us! Let us, with even more enthusiastic political passion and even more vigorous fighting spirit, implement policies, strictly observe discipline, unite with the broad masses of the people and young students, and fulfill the sacred mission entrusted to our army by the Constitution to defend the people's peaceful labor!

    《解放军报》6月4日社论
    坚决拥护党中央决策　坚决镇压反革命暴乱
    自六月三日凌晨开始，首都发生了严重的反革命暴乱。一伙唯恐天下不乱的歹徒，肆意制造谣言，挑动一些人非法设卡，围攻、殴打、绑架军人，打死打伤我干部战士，砸烧军车，抢劫武器弹药，并冲击中南海，冲击人民大会堂，抢劫商店，焚烧大楼。发生在首都的这起骇人听闻的暴乱，是建国以来从未有过的，是一个时期以来极少数人阴谋制造动乱的恶性发展，是他们反对中国共产党的领导、反对社会主义制度罪恶企图的集中暴露。为了捍卫伟大的中华人民共和国、捍卫神圣的宪法，捍卫庄严的首都，党中央、国务院、中央军委迅速作出镇压反革命暴乱的决策，我戒严部队和首都公安干警、武警部队一起，采取果断措施，以一往无前、勇敢无畏的精神，迅速平息了这场暴乱。这是在制止动乱，维护首都和全国安定团结的斗争中所取得的一个伟大胜利。
    我军一些部队奉命进入北京部分地区执行戒严任务，半个月来为制止动乱、维护首都社会秩序，做了大量艰苦细致的工作。他们以全心全意为人民服务，做威武之师、文明之师的实际行动，逐步赢得了首都各界人民包括青年学生的理解和支持。但是，一伙歹徒不甘心他们的失败，到处煽风点火，采用种种卑劣手法制造事端、扩大动乱，已经到了令人无法容忍的地步。不对这伙以身试法的暴徒给予严惩，就没有什么法制可言，没有什么社会秩序可言，没有什么安定团结的局面可言！面对暴徒的反动气焰，戒严部队广大干部战士牢记党和人民的重托，发扬邓主席倡导的“五种革命精神”，在党和国家的命运面临严重威胁的关头，又一次立下了历史功绩。他们的行动有力地证明，我们这支军队在关键时刻是过得硬、信得过的，不愧是人民利益的坚强保卫者，是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石！
    我军戒严部队进入城区后，将坚决按照国务院的戒严令和北京市人民政府令执行勤务。毫无疑问，我们将一如既往地坚持热爱首都，热爱首都人民，热爱青年学生，为保卫好首都的重要目标，为维护首都的生产、学习、工作和生活秩序，为保护人民的生命财产安全而竭尽全力。对那些继续策划暴乱，扰乱治安，进行打、砸、抢、烧的不法之徒，将协助公安干警和武警部队给予严惩，决不手软！我们希望而且相信广大市民和青年学生一定会积极协助部队干部战士完成戒严任务，使首都的正常秩序尽快得到恢复。
    戒严部队全体干部战士同志们，首都人民瞩望着我们，全国人民期待着我们！让我们以更加饱满的政治热情，以更加昂扬的斗志，执行政策，严守纪律，团结广大人民群众和青年学生，完成好宪法赋予我军保卫人民和平劳动的神圣使命！
