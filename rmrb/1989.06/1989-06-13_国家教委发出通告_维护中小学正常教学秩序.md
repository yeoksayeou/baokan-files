Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 13th.

The State Education Commission yesterday issued a notice titled "Notice on Maintaining Normal Teaching Order in Primary and Secondary Schools." The full text is as follows:

To maintain normal teaching order in primary and secondary schools, the State Education Commission solemnly announces to all primary and secondary schools, all levels of educational administrative departments, and all sectors of society:

1. In recent times, the vast majority of primary and secondary school staff, teachers, and workers, with the support and cooperation of student parents and all sectors of society, have, in the spirit of being responsible to the country and to young people, considered the bigger picture, overcome various difficulties, and remained at their posts to ensure the normal progress of teaching work. They have made significant contributions to maintaining a stable and united situation. The State Education Commission expresses its highest respect and heartfelt thanks to them.

2. All Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, cadres, and teaching staff in primary and secondary schools and educational administrative departments must seriously study the "Notice to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council." They must understand the current situation and maintain political and practical unity with the Central Committee of the Party. All teaching staff must clearly help students understand the facts of this rebellion in classrooms and outside, using the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing and the turmoil in various places as examples to educate the majority of teachers and students. They must recognize the counter-revolutionary nature of this rebellion, not believe in rumors, not spread rumors, and resist various reactionary propaganda that misleads people. Some teachers, due to not understanding the facts and lacking political experience, have different understandings of the nature of the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, which is understandable and can be gradually unified through study. However, it must be made clear that the education of students must be conducted in accordance with the spirit of the notice to the whole Party and the people of the whole country by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, as well as the speeches of the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, to protect the healthy growth of the minds of minors. This is a sacred duty and discipline that people's teachers must follow.

Schools should organize senior high school students to study relevant documents and conduct education for all students to love the Communist Party, love socialism, and love the People's Liberation Army.

3. All levels of people's governments, educational administrative departments, and all sectors of society should continue to work hard to maintain the normal teaching order in primary and secondary schools. The vast majority of primary and secondary school teachers and staff should remain at their posts, fulfill their duties, work hard, and strive to improve the quality of education. The enrollment and graduation examinations of primary and secondary schools must be conducted on schedule, and without the approval of the county-level people's government and the higher-level educational administrative departments, they must not be changed at will.

The vast majority of young people are the future of the country and the hope of the nation. Ensuring that primary and secondary school students have a good learning environment is not only the responsibility of all levels of people's governments, educational administrative departments, and schools, but also the social responsibility that all sectors of society and student parents cannot shirk. The State Education Commission hopes that student parents and all sectors of society will continue to make efforts to maintain the normal teaching order in primary and secondary schools.

　　国家教委发出通告
    维护中小学正常教学秩序
    本报北京６月１３日讯  国家教委昨天发出《关于维护中小学正常教学秩序的通告》，全文如下：
    为了维护中小学正常教学秩序，国家教育委员会向全国所有中小学、各级教育行政部门和社会各界再次郑重通告：
    一、最近一段时间，广大中小学校的干部、教师和职工，在学生家长和社会各界的支持、配合下，本着对国家负责、对青少年负责的精神，顾全大局，克服种种困难，坚守岗位，保证教学工作的正常进行，为维护安定团结的局面做出了重大贡献。对此，国家教委向他们表示崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢。
    二、中小学和教育行政部门的所有共产党员、共青团员、干部和教职员工都要认真学习《中共中央、国务院告全体共产党员和全国人民书》，认清当前形势，在政治上、行动上同党中央保持一致。全体教职工在课堂内外都要旗帜鲜明地帮助学生了解这场暴乱的事实真相，要以北京的反革命暴乱和各地动乱的事例来教育广大师生，认清这场暴乱的反革命性质，不相信谣言，不传播谣言，抵制各种蛊惑人心的反动宣传。少数教师由于对事实真相不了解和缺乏政治经验，对动乱和反革命暴乱的性质认识上有不同，是可以理解的，要通过学习逐步统一认识。但应明确指出，对学生进行教育必须按党中央、国务院告全党和全国人民书以及老一辈无产阶级革命家的讲话等精神进行，以保护未成年学生心灵的健康成长。这是做为人民教师必须遵守的神圣职责和纪律。
    学校要组织中学高年级的学生学习有关文件，对全体学生都要进行热爱共产党、热爱社会主义、热爱人民解放军的教育。
    三、各级人民政府、教育行政部门和社会各界应为维护中小学正常教学秩序继续努力。广大中小学教职工应坚守岗位，克尽职守，认真工作，努力提高教育质量。中小学的招生和毕业考试等工作必须如期进行，未经县级人民政府和上级教育行政部门批准，不得随意改变。
    广大青少年是祖国的未来，民族的希望。保证中小学学生有一个良好的学习环境，不单是各级人民政府、教育行政部门和学校的责任，也是社会各界、学生家长义不容辞的社会责任。国家教委希望学生家长和社会各界为维护中小学的正常教学秩序继续做出努力。
