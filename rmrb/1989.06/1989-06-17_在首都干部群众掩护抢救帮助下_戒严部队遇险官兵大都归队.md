	In the face of the counterrevolutionary riot in the capital, cadres and masses of central state organs, and various levels of party and government departments in Beijing, have wholeheartedly sheltered, rescued, and aided the scattered and injured soldiers of the martial law and armed police forces. Currently, except for those injured who have been sent to hospitals for treatment, most of these soldiers have returned to their units.

	During the implementation of martial law to quell the counterrevolutionary riot, some soldiers encountered dangers and even went missing. The masses spontaneously protected, rescued, and sheltered these soldiers. On the day the counterrevolutionary riot broke out, an elderly woman living in Dongdan was nursing a sickness at home. She saw two injured soldiers still being beaten by thugs and, risking danger, pulled the soldiers into her home, closed the door tightly, and found emergency medicine to bandage the soldiers' wounds and cooked food for them to eat. In the early hours of June 3, a colonel was knocked down by rioters with stones, covered in blood, and in critical condition. Five citizens rushed out from a side alley, carried the colonel into a small courtyard for rescue. The thugs chased behind, and several women in the courtyard immediately went out to the alley entrance to drive the thugs away.

	Central state organs and various levels of party and government departments in Beijing also contributed to finding, protecting, and sheltering the soldiers. More than 80 armed police soldiers were besieged by people who did not understand the truth in Xisi, and the situation was extremely dangerous. Leaders and comrades from the Ministry of Geology and Mineral Resources took the soldiers to the office, arranged accommodations and food, and sent them television sets and necessary living supplies. A medical vehicle of a certain martial law unit was blocked and stopped at the west entrance of Tiyuguan Road. The rioters crazily attempted to burn the vehicle, but some cadres and staff from the State Sports Commission bravely protected it, guided the way, and turned the danger into safety. The Beijing Municipal Party Committee, Municipal Government, and various district and county party and government organs made unified arrangements and deployments to find the whereabouts of the scattered soldiers. Leaders and staff at all levels worked tirelessly to find the scattered soldiers by all means. Dongcheng District safely transferred 125 scattered soldiers to a reliable place and sent 32 injured soldiers to the hospital for treatment. Nearly 10 leaders of the Shijingshan District Party Committee personally went to the streets to find and rescue scattered and besieged cadres and soldiers, took them to the district party committee courtyard, arranged accommodations and food, and then sent them to the unit gathering place by car.

　　在首都干部群众掩护抢救帮助下
    戒严部队遇险官兵大都归队
    据新华社北京６月１７日电  中央国家机关、北京市各级党政部门和人民群众，在首都发生反革命暴乱的危难关头，满腔热情收留、救治戒严部队、武警部队失散官兵和伤员。目前，这些官兵除伤员被送往医院治疗外，大部分已返回部队。
    戒严部队奉命进城平息反革命暴乱中，一些官兵遇险以至下落不明。人民群众自发地掩护、抢救、收留这些子弟兵。反革命暴乱发生的当天，家住东单的一位大娘在家养病，看到两名负伤的战士仍被歹徒追打，冒着危险将战士拉进家中，紧闭房门，并找来应急药为战士包扎，做饭给战士吃。６月３日凌晨，一位中校被暴徒用乱石打倒在地，浑身是血，生命垂危。５位市民从便道冲出，将中校抬进胡同小院抢救，歹徒们在后面追赶，院里几名妇女立即走出胡同口将歹徒支走。
    中央国家机关和北京市各级党政部门也为寻找、掩护、收留子弟兵做出了贡献。８０多名武警官兵被不明真相的人围困在西四，情况十分危急。地质矿产部的领导和同志将官兵接到机关，安排食宿，送去电视机和生活必需品。某戒严部队卫生队车辆被堵，停在体育馆路西口，暴徒们疯狂地要上前烧车，国家体委的部分干部和职工，奋力上前保护，疏导引路，使卫生队转危为安。北京市委、市政府和各区、县党政机关，为寻找失散子弟兵的下落，做了统一安排部署，各级领导和工作人员不辞辛苦，千方百计寻找失散的子弟兵。东城区将失散的１２５名官兵安全转移到可靠的地方，并将３２名伤员送到医院治疗。石景山区委近１０名领导亲自上街寻找、解救失散和被围困的干部战士，将他们接到区委大院，安排食宿，然后又派车将官兵转送部队集结地。
