Persistent rain since June 3 has been unfavorable for the wheat harvest in northern regions.

The Central Meteorological Observatory reported that from June 3 to 7, the Huaihe region, including provinces such as Jiangsu, Henan, Anhui, and Hubei, experienced rainfall ranging from 20 to 150 millimeters. This has negatively impacted the timely harvesting and threshing of wheat in these areas, particularly in southern Henan, where rainfall ranged from 50 to 150 millimeters. The Jianghuai region also experienced continuous rainfall. According to the Central Meteorological Observatory, rainfall of 30 to 70 millimeters is expected to continue in the Huaihe and Jianghuai regions until June 9, with some areas possibly receiving up to 100 millimeters.
