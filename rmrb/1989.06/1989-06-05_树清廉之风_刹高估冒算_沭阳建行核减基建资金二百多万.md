The Shuyang branch of the Construction Bank has been strictly implementing the state's policies to reduce the scale of construction investment. They have promoted a culture of integrity and rigorously scrutinized construction investment proposals. Since 1986, they have reduced construction funds by 2,251,600 yuan.

In recent years, with the deepening of reform and opening up, Shuyang's economic construction has made significant progress. The number of construction projects across the county has increased markedly. However, some construction enterprises, in pursuit of their own economic benefits, have disregarded national interests and inflated construction costs. Some have even resorted to various means, such as entertaining and bribing officials, to push through their proposals, disrupting normal construction order and increasing national expenditure. To rectify this situation, the Shuyang branch of the Construction Bank first educated its party members and the masses to prioritize the interests of the party and the state, establishing a culture of integrity and honesty. They have implemented a set of regulations to resist improper practices, such as "four nos": not accepting gifts, not attending banquets, not obstructing customers, and not accepting gifts. Simultaneously, they established a specialized team led by the bank manager to review construction project funding proposals according to state policies, strengthening various strict review systems and standards. They also changed the previous general review method to a combination of key and comprehensive reviews.

In August of last year, a construction enterprise in the county undertook the construction of the county postal building, reporting a construction cost of 1,190,000 yuan to the bank. After scientific calculation and review, the bank reduced the cost by 140,000 yuan, which is 11.8% of the original cost. During the Spring Festival of last year, three construction enterprises in the county secretly gave 1,400 yuan to Wang Yinwu of the bank's business department to ensure their construction cost proposals passed smoothly. Wang Yinwu immediately returned the money. Later, these three enterprises asked county leaders to intervene, but the bank manager, Wang Shili, refused and reduced the inflated construction costs of these three enterprises by 300,000 yuan according to state regulations. Statistics show that over the past three years, the Shuyang branch of the Construction Bank has reviewed 55 construction investment projects valued at 24,056,500 yuan, reducing funds by 2,251,600 yuan, which is 9.35% of the original value, with a 100% accuracy rate in case settlement.

　　树清廉之风　刹高估冒算
    沭阳建行核减基建资金二百多万
    本报讯  沭阳县建设银行认真执行国家压缩基建投资规模的有关政策，树清廉之风，严把基建投资审查关，１９８６年以来共核减基建资金２２５．１６万元。
    近几年来，随着改革开放的不断深入，沭阳的经济建设有了长足的发展，全县各种基建工程明显增多，但是，一些建筑企业为追求本单位的经济效益，置国家利益于不顾，在工程造价上高估冒算，有的建筑企业为达到目的还变着法儿请客送礼、托人说情，一度扰乱了正常的基建秩序，加大了国家的资金耗费。为扭转这种状况，沭阳建行首先教育党员群众以党和国家利益为重，树立清正廉洁新风，建立了抵制不正之风的一整套规章制度，如做到“四不”，即：不收馈赠、不赴宴席、不卡顾客、不要礼品。同时，成立由行长挂帅的基建工程资金预算审查的专门班子，按国家有关政策，健全各种严密的审查制度、标准。并且改变过去审查工作中的一般性审查为重点审查和全面审查。
    去年８月，县一家建筑企业承接了县邮电大楼的建筑工程，上报建行的造价为１１９万元，建行经过科学测算审查，核减了１４万元，占原造价的１１．８％。去年春节，县三个建筑企业为使上报的基建工程造价指标顺利过关，悄悄塞给建行业务科王寅武１４００元，被王寅武当场退回。后来这三个企业又托县有关部门领导前来说情，也被行长王士领拒绝，并按国家规定核减了这三个企业原工程造价高估冒算的资金３０万元。据统计，三年来沭阳建行共审查基建投资项目５５份，价值２４０５．６５万元，核减资金２２５．１６万元，占原价值的９．３５％，定案准确率达１００％。　　　　　　　　　　（沈根）
