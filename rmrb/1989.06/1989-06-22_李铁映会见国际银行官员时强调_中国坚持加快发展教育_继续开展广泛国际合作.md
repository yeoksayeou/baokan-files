State Councilor and Minister of the State Education Commission Li Tieying today, in a meeting with World Bank China Office Director Shahid Javed Burki, pointed out that China's policy of carrying out extensive international cooperation in the field of education will not change.

During the meeting, both sides exchanged views on continuing to develop cooperation between China and the World Bank in the field of education.

Li Tieying said that the Chinese government will adhere to the policy of accelerating the development of education, regarding it as a fundamental strategic measure for revitalizing the Chinese nation and building socialism.

He said that without the development of education and the improvement of the cultural quality of the entire nation, the modernization of socialist construction would not be possible.

He said that China's situation is stable and will continue to improve. The policies of educational reform and opening up will be steadfastly implemented.

Li Tieying said, "In the past decade, China's education has made great strides, but there are still over 200 million illiterates, and the educational level is low, so the task of revitalizing education and educating the people is very arduous."

He also reviewed the successful cooperation between China and the World Bank since 1981. He said, "China has signed six educational loan projects with the World Bank and hopes that the World Bank will continue to support and cooperate with China's new educational development projects."

Burki will depart for Shanghai tomorrow.

　　李铁映会见国际银行官员时强调    
    中国坚持加快发展教育  继续开展广泛国际合作
    新华社北京６月２２日电（记者杨国强）国务委员兼国家教委主任李铁映今天在会见世界银行中国局局长沙希德·伯基时指出，中国在教育方面开展广泛的国际合作的方针不会改变。
    会见中，双方就继续发展中国与世界银行在教育方面的合作交换了意见。
    李铁映说，中国政府将坚持加快发展教育的方针政策，把发展教育看作是振兴中华民族，建设社会主义的根本性的战略措施。
    他说，没有教育的发展，没有全民族文化素质的提高，社会主义现代化建设就不可能实现。
    他说，中国的局势是稳定的，并且会向更好的方面发展。教育改革、开放的方针、政策都将坚定不移地执行下去。
    李铁映说：“近十年来，中国教育有了很大的发展，但仍然有２亿多文盲，教育水平也低，所以振兴教育、教育人民的任务十分艰巨。”
    他还回顾了中国同世界银行自１９８１年以来所进行的成功合作。他说：“中国已同世界银行签订了６个教育贷款项目，希望世界银行对中国教育发展的新项目继续给予支持和合作。”
    伯基将于明天离京赴上海访问。
