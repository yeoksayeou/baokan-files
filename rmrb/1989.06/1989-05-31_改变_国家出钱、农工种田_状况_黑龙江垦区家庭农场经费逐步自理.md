The more than 100 state-owned farms in the Heilongjiang Reclamation Area have changed the long-standing situation of "state funding, farmers cultivating" through the reform of establishing workers' family farms. Farm workers are gradually becoming the main investors in various production and construction projects.

Statistics from relevant departments in the reclamation area show that from the start of establishing workers' family farms in 1985 to early 1989, the investment self-raised by family farms for production fixed assets and circulating assets has reached 197.96 million yuan, equivalent to 102% of the total investment allocated by the state to the reclamation area during the same period.

At the same time, the circulating funds self-raised by family farms for purchasing fertilizers, oil, pesticides, seeds, and other items have also been increasing year by year.

This year, the circulating funds self-raised by family farms for agricultural production this year have reached 254 million yuan, accounting for approximately 33.7% of the total funds needed for spring plowing in the reclamation area. This has broken the pattern of state-owned farms relying solely on state investment for development, not only alleviating the financial strain in the reclamation area but also enhancing the risk awareness and benefit consciousness of family farms.

　　改变“国家出钱、农工种田”状况
    黑龙江垦区家庭农场经费逐步自理
    据新华社哈尔滨５月３１日电  （记者王来喜）黑龙江垦区所属的１００多个国营农场，在兴办职工家庭农场的改革中，已经改变了延续多年的“国家出钱、农工种田”的状况，农业工人正在逐步成为各项生产建设投资的主体。
    垦区有关部提供的数字表明，从１９８５年开始兴办职工家庭农场到１９８９年初，家庭农场自筹的用于生产性固定资产和流动资产的投资已达１９７９６万元，相当于同期国家给垦区的拨改贷投资总额的１０２％。
    与此同时，家庭农场自筹的用于购买化肥、油料、农药、种子等项的流动资金，也在逐年增长。
    今年，家庭农场自筹用于当年农业生产的流动资金已达２．５４亿元，约占垦区春耕生产所需资金总额的３３．７％。这打破了国营农场单纯依赖国家投资发展生产的局面，不仅使垦区资金紧张状况得到缓解，而且使家庭农场增强了风险意识和效益意识。
