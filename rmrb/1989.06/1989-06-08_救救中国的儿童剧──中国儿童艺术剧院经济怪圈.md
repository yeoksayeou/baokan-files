The China Children's Art Theatre, which specializes in performances for children, has been producing hit after hit in recent years, but it is also sinking deeper into a financial crisis. The theatre believes that the creation and performance of children's theater have fallen into a painful cycle.

First, children need children's theater, but the troupe cannot afford to perform. The auditorium of Beijing's North Sea Kindergarten, with over 400 people, was packed. After the curtain call of the musical "Happy Hans" performed by the Children's Art Theatre, the applause from the children and parents in the audience continued for a long time. It rained, but the children of Donghua Gate Kindergarten in Beijing held umbrellas and insisted on watching the "Treasure Ship" performed by the Children's Art Theatre. Children love to watch children's theater, but major theaters are reluctant to stage children's plays because the rental fee is 600 yuan, while the box office revenue is at most 300 yuan. How can each performance not lose hundreds of yuan? For many years, the ticket price for children's theater has never exceeded 60 cents, while a string of ice sugar gourds in Beijing has risen to 1 yuan. Is it that children do not have money to watch children's theater? It seems not. Parents have always been generous in investing in their children's intelligence, buying a Transformer for dozens of yuan without batting an eye. Perhaps in people's minds, it is natural for children's theater tickets to be cheaper than spoken drama and opera, unaware of the difficulty of creating a beautiful and lively fairy tale world!

Second, the creation and performance of children's theater require high investment but yield low returns. The most financially strapped department in the theater is the stage design team. Zhang Wenxiang, the head of the costume department, thinks of every way to save money when she receives a new play purchase task. To save a few yuan, she can run through all the major department stores in Beijing. The stage design team's budget for the new play "Sun Sacrifice" was 6,700 yuan, but the theater cut 400 yuan when approving it. Zhang Wenxiang was heartbroken: "The performance effect is no longer my primary consideration. What can I do? There's no money! For the role of the mayor in 'Sun Sacrifice,' he should wear a trench coat. To save 7 yuan, I bought a second-rate one."

Third, children's theater has high social benefits but extremely low labor remuneration. The economic impact from the film and television industry has made an important incentive for the China Children's Art Theatre—labor remuneration—fade. Children's theater actors portray children, with high technical difficulty, combining singing, dancing, and character portrayal, with high labor intensity, but the labor remuneration is meager. In recent years, many actors of the Children's Art Theatre have attracted attention when they occasionally enter the film and television industry. Wang Tiecheng, Zhao Youliang, Xue Bai, Xu Yajun, and others have long been noticed by the film and television industry. Filming a film or television show can easily earn a thousand or eight hundred yuan, but in the theater, each performance earns only 4 yuan.

Looking at the financial sources of various major art theaters in China, there are only three: state subsidies, theater performance income, and paid services to the outside. However, the China Children's Art Theatre still finds it difficult to move forward on these three paths.

Save the children! Save China's children's theater!

### 救救中国的儿童剧──中国儿童艺术剧院经济怪圈

　　救救中国的儿童剧
    ──中国儿童艺术剧院经济怪圈
    本报记者  田晓明
    专为孩子们演戏的中国儿童艺术剧院，这几年好戏叠出，同时在捉襟见肘的资金窘境中越陷越深。剧院认为，儿童剧的创作与演出已陷入了痛苦的怪圈。
    一是孩子们需要儿童剧，而剧团却演不起。北海幼儿园４００多人的小礼堂爆满，儿艺演出的歌舞剧《快乐的汉斯》谢幕许久，场内孩子和家长的掌声仍然经久不息。下雨了，北京东华门幼儿园的孩子们打着伞，也要看完儿艺演的《宝船》。……孩子们爱看儿童剧，但是各大剧院却不敢上演儿童剧，因为场租６００元，票房收入最多不过３００元，哪一场演出不亏几百元呢！多少年了，儿童剧的票价从没超过６毛钱，而北京的冰糖葫芦一串却涨到１块钱。是孩子们没有钱看儿童剧吗？似乎不是，家长对孩子的智力投资从来慷慨大方，好几十元买件变形金刚，连眼睛也不眨一下。也许人们心目中：儿童剧的票价比话剧、歌剧便宜是天经地义的，孰不知儿童剧要创造一个美丽生动的童话境界是何其艰难！
    二是儿童剧创作与演出投入高，收入低。剧院里最为经费短缺焦心的是舞美队。服装组组长张文香一接新戏采买任务，就挖空心思地抠钱，为买便宜几块钱的料子，她能跑遍北京市的各大商场。新戏《太阳之祭》舞美队预算６７００元，剧院审批时一狠心砍去了４００。张文香痛心疾首：“演出效果已不是我考虑的首要条件，没办法，哪有钱啊？《太阳之祭》中有个角色是市长，出场时应穿风衣，为便宜７元钱，我给买了次品。”
    三是儿童剧社会效益高，而劳动报酬极低。来自影视圈的经济冲击，使得中国儿童艺术剧院重要的激励因素──劳动报酬暗然失色。儿童剧演员由成年人扮演儿童，演技难度大，集歌、舞、人物形象塑造于一身，劳动强度高，而劳动报酬却少得可怜。儿艺这几年许多演员偶涉影视圈便引人注目。王铁成、赵有亮、薛白、许亚军等早已为影视界所关注。拍一部影视片能轻而易举地拿上千八百，而在剧院每演一场戏，演出报酬不过４元钱。
    纵观中国各大艺术剧院的财源无非三个：国家差额拨款；剧院演出收入；对外有偿服务。然而，中国儿童剧院在这三条路上行走依然举步维艰。
    救救孩子！救救中国的儿童剧！
