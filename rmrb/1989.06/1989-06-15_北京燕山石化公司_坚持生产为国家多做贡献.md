Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 15th.

During the turmoil and rioting in the capital, the more than 40,000 employees of the Beijing Yanshan Petrochemical Corporation demonstrated a high sense of responsibility as masters of the country. They steadfastly held their production posts and made greater contributions to the nation.

Yanshan Petrochemical has 48 large-scale production units and achieved a profit and tax revenue of 1.832 billion yuan last year. In the past two months, the turmoil and rioting in the capital have seriously disrupted the normal production order of Yanshan Petrochemical. Due to traffic obstacles, not only did employees face difficulties in attending work, but production also suffered some losses. The company's party and government leadership departments, along with the majority of employees, used every possible means to overcome difficulties, hold their posts, and make up for the losses with practical actions. The company has more than 7,000 employees living in the city, 50 kilometers away from the plant area. To ensure punctual attendance, some employees ride bicycles to work, while others walk for several hours to the Yongdingmen train station to catch a train to work. According to the company's production department, the employee attendance rate has consistently remained above 97%.

On May 20th, the first day of martial law in parts of Beijing, Yanshan Petrochemical began its annual major equipment overhaul. The original plan was to take 40 days, but through efforts, it is expected to be completed 10 days ahead of schedule. On June 3rd, the counter-revolutionary rioting in the city severely affected this enterprise. Some hoodlums and idle people took advantage of the situation to incite workers to go on strike in various plants of the company and set up roadblocks to prevent workers from going to work. However, the company's party and government leaders, along with the majority of employees, took a clear stand against these troublemakers, organized thousands of people to form a plant protection team, cleared roadblocks, maintained traffic and production order, and ensured the safe and high-quality completion of the major overhaul.

While some units were undergoing overhauls, Yanshan Petrochemical continued normal production. In May, the entire company processed 576,000 tons of crude oil, achieving a production value of 257 million yuan, an increase of 18.7% and 7.4% respectively compared to the same period last year.

By the end of May, the rubber factory, carpet factory, machinery factory, and instrument factory under the company had completed more than half of their annual production value plan ahead of schedule. A batch of key products such as gasoline, diesel, lubricating oil, paraffin, polyethylene agricultural film, toluene, and acetone had also completed their production plans for the first half of the year ahead of schedule. In the first ten days of June, despite the fact that some equipment was undergoing overhauls and products could not be shipped on time due to traffic obstacles, the company still completed 28% of the monthly production value plan. General Manager Wu Xiegang said: The employees of Yanshan Petrochemical must make up for the losses caused by the turmoil and rioting and complete the production tasks for June.

　　北京燕山石化公司
    坚持生产为国家多做贡献
    新华社北京６月１５日电  （记者赖云川、刘浦泉）在首都发生动乱和暴乱期间，北京燕山石化公司的４万多名职工以高度的主人翁责任感，坚守生产岗位，为国家多做贡献。
    燕化拥有４８套大型生产装置，去年实现利税１８．３２亿元。近两个月来，首都发生的动乱和暴乱给燕化的正常生产秩序带来了严重的冲击。由于交通受阻，不仅职工出勤困难，生产也受到一定损失。公司党政领导部门和广大职工千方百计克服困难，坚守岗位，以实际行动夺回损失。这个公司有７０００多名职工家住远离厂区５０公里的城里，为了按时出勤，他们有的骑自行车上班，有的步行几小时到永定门车站坐火车上班。据公司生产部门统计，职工出勤率一直保持９７％以上。
    在５月２０日北京部分地区戒严的第一天，燕化公司开始进行一年一度的设备大检修。原计划要花４０天时间，经过努力，预计可提前１０天完成。６月３日北京城里发生的反革命暴乱严重波及到这个企业。社会上一些痞子和闲杂人员趁机到公司各厂煽动工人罢工，并设置路障阻止工人上班。但公司党政领导和广大职工旗帜鲜明地对这些捣乱分子进行了坚决的斗争，组织了数千人的护厂队，清理路障，维持交通秩序和生产秩序，保证大检修安全、优质地顺利进行。
    在部分装置进行检修的同时，燕化公司坚持正常生产。５月份，全公司加工原油５７．６万吨，实现产值２．５７亿元，分别比去年同期增长１８．７％和７．４％。
    截至５月底，所属橡胶厂、地毯厂、机械厂和仪表厂已提前完成了全年产值计划的一半以上，汽油、柴油、润滑油、石蜡、聚乙烯农膜料、甲苯、丙酮等一批重点产品也提前完成了上半年的产量计划。６月上旬，公司在部分设备检修和交通受阻产品不能及时发运的情况下，仍完成当月计划产值的２８％。公司总经理吴协刚说：燕化职工一定要夺回动乱和暴乱造成的损失，完成６月份的生产任务。
