At the end of March 1988, the newspaper received an anonymous letter from Beihui Town, Yibin County, Sichuan Province. The letter revealed:

On March 11th and 16th, 1988, Yibin County Industrial and Commercial Bureau and its subordinate Kongtan Industrial and Commercial Office seized 270 cases of Red Plum and Jade Filter cigarettes, valued at over 200,000 yuan, from the Kongtan Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau in Yibin County's Baihua District. It was alleged that these cigarettes were smuggled by personnel from Yibin County Public Security Bureau dressed in police uniforms and escorted by police vehicles. This was not the first time Yibin County Public Security Bureau had engaged in such activities. The previous year, they had organized a group to smuggle high-grade cigarettes. The letter hoped that the Party newspaper would uphold justice and publicly expose this case.

After receiving the letter, on April 2, 1988, the Mass Work Department of the newspaper sent a letter to the Yibin Regional Administrative Office:

The newspaper received a letter signed "People's Letter" reporting that the Kongtan Sub-bureau of the Public Security Bureau in Yibin County was seized by the county's Industrial and Commercial Bureau on March 11th and 16th, 1988, with 270 cases of Red Plum and Jade Filter cigarettes, valued at over 200,000 yuan. The letter stated that the issue of Yibin County Public Security Bureau smuggling high-grade cigarettes had existed since the previous year. The copy of the letter is enclosed for your investigation and handling. Please reply with the results as soon as possible.

Three months passed, and the Mass Work Department of the newspaper, having not received a reply, sent a second letter to the Yibin Regional Administrative Office on July 22, 1988:

Our department sent a copy of the letter signed "People's Letter" on April 2nd, requesting the Administrative Office to investigate the issues raised in the letter and to reply with the results as soon as possible. To date, no reply has been received. We do not know the current status of the investigation. Please inform us promptly.

Several more months passed, and the Yibin Regional Administrative Office still had not replied to the newspaper. On December 16, 1988, the newspaper sent a third letter to the Yibin Regional Administrative Office:

On April 2nd of this year, our department sent a copy of the letter signed "People's Letter," requesting an investigation into the issues raised in the letter and a prompt reply with the results. However, no response has been received. On July 22nd, our department sent a letter inquiring about the situation; on August 23rd, we also made a phone call to follow up, but still no reply has been received. We do not know the reason for this. Please inform us of the investigation status promptly.

On January 26, 1989, the Letter and Visit Office of the Yibin Municipal Party Committee and the Yibin Regional Administrative Office replied to the Mass Work Department of the newspaper; at the same time, they forwarded a notice from the Yibin Regional Discipline Inspection Commission regarding the investigation of Yibin County Public Security Bureau's cigarette smuggling case. The summary is as follows:

After receiving the letter from your department on April 2, 1988, requesting an investigation into the case of Yibin County Public Security Bureau and Kongtan Sub-bureau smuggling high-grade cigarettes, the leadership of the Administrative Office attached great importance to the matter and instructed the Regional Discipline Inspection Commission and the regional judicial departments to conduct a joint investigation. The problem has now been clarified, and the relevant personnel have been seriously dealt with.

From November 1986 to March 1988, Yibin County Public Security Bureau, under the pretext of "raising funds for meetings," violated state industrial and commercial, tobacco monopoly regulations, and relevant policies, and engaged in cigarette smuggling six times, totaling 129,000 cartons, with a total turnover of 415,000 yuan and illegal profits of 16,000 yuan. Yibin County Public Security Bureau received 6,900 yuan, and 7,900 yuan in taxes were evaded. During the investigation, they continued to smuggle while being investigated. In the process of smuggling, Yibin County Public Security Bureau, under the guise of business contacts, provided introduction letters to police stations along the route or used their own vehicles to transport cigarettes to the border between Sichuan and Yunnan; or dressed in police uniforms to escort the vehicles, even carrying guns for "protection." They also showed their work permits, gun permits, and handguns to the factory to gain trust.

For this, the Yibin Municipal Party Committee and the Yibin County People's Government separately dealt with the relevant personnel of Yibin County Public Security Bureau's cigarette smuggling case:

Yibin County Committee member, County Government Leading Group member, County Public Security Bureau Chief, and Deputy Secretary of the Bureau Party Committee, Comrade Lü Zeren, participated in and supported the speculation and smuggling activities, and had a poor attitude towards admitting his mistakes. It was decided to remove him from his positions as County Committee member, Bureau Party Committee Deputy Secretary, and Committee member, and to demote him administratively.

Yibin County Public Security Bureau Party Committee Secretary and Standing Committee member of the County People's Congress, Yan Guochang, supported the speculation and smuggling activities. Given his relatively good attitude towards admitting his mistakes, it was decided to give him a serious warning within the party and to recommend his removal from his position as Standing Committee member of the County People's Congress by law.

Yibin County Public Security Bureau Party Committee member and Deputy Chief in charge of criminal investigation, Guo Xiangming, honestly admitted his mistakes. It was decided to give him a serious warning within the party and a major demerit administratively.

The head of the Political Security Section, Mao Chonghan, led police officers to engage in cigarette smuggling five times, totaling 59,000 cartons, with a turnover of 260,000 yuan. During the smuggling activities, he evaded taxes and continued to smuggle while being investigated. It was decided to place him under party supervision for one year and to remove him from his position as head of the Political Security Section administratively.

Deputy Chief of the Criminal Investigation Team, Yuan Ande, in addition to organizing the Criminal Investigation Team to smuggle cigarettes, also smuggled 30 tons of fertilizer, making illegal profits of 3,200 yuan. It was decided to expel him from the party and to recommend that the judicial authorities pursue criminal responsibility (he has been arrested).

For other police officers involved in this case, they were given serious criticism and education; the Party Committee of Yibin County Public Security Bureau was rectified and educated.

In addition, for the personnel involved in this case from Yibin County Tobacco Company, Nixi, and Anbian District Supply and Marketing Cooperatives, they were dealt with by the Yibin County Committee and County Government.

　　多次催促有了结果——
    宜宾县公安局倒卖香烟受查处
    １９８８年３月底，本报收到一封发自四川宜宾县柏汇镇的匿名检举信，这封来信反映：
    １９８８年３月１１日和１６日，宜宾县工商局和下属孔滩工商所从宜宾县白花区孔滩派出所查获红梅牌、翡翠牌过滤嘴香烟２７０件，价值２０多万元。据说，这些烟是由宜宾县公安局派人身穿警服，动用警车武装押运倒卖的。宜宾县公安局倒卖香烟已不止一次。去年他们就曾组织集团倒卖高级香烟。希望党报能伸张正义，公开揭露这一案件。
    接到这封信后，１９８８年４月２日，本报群众工作部致函宜宾地区行署：
    本报收到一封署名“人民来信”的信件，反映宜宾县白花区孔滩派出所被该县工商局于１９８８年３月１１日和１６日两次查出红梅、翡翠香烟２７０件，价值２０多万元。来信说，宜宾县公安局倒卖高级香烟的问题去年就已存在。现转去来信的复印件，请查处，处理结果望尽快函寄我部。
    ３个多月过去了，本报群众工作部因没有收到复函，便于１９８８年７月２２日第二次致函宜宾地区行署：
    我部于４月２日转去署名“人民来信”的读者来信复印件，发函要求行署就信中反映的问题进行查处，将处理结果尽快函寄我部。至今未见回信，不知现在查处情况如何？望速告知。
    又过了几个月，宜宾地区行署仍未函复本报，我们于１９８８年１２月１６日第三次致函宜宾地区行署：
    今年４月２日，我部转去署名“人民来信”的读者来信复印件，要求就信中所反映的问题进行查处，处理结果尽快函寄我部。可是，未见回音。７月２２日，我部发函查询；８月２３日又打电话催办，至今未见答复。不知何故？查处情况如何？望速告知。
    １９８９年１月２６日，中共宜宾地委、宜宾地区行署信访办公室给本报群众工作部复函；同时还转来了中共宜宾地区纪律检查委员会查处宜宾县公安局倒卖香烟一案的通报。摘要如下：
    宜宾地区行政公署接你部１９８８年４月２日要求查处宜宾县公安局与孔滩派出所贩卖高级香烟一案的函后，行署领导极为重视，责成地纪委和地区政法部门进行了联合调查。现问题已查清，并对有关人员作了严肃处理。
    宜宾县公安局从１９８６年１１月至１９８８年３月，以“筹集会议经费”等为名，违反国家工商、烟草专卖等法规和有关政策，先后６次倒卖卷烟计１２．９万条，总经营额达４１．５万元，非法获利１．６万元。其中宜宾县公安局分得６９００元，还偷漏税款７９００元。有关部门在调查时，他们仍边查边犯。在贩烟过程中，宜宾县公安局以联系业务为名，给沿途公安局开有介绍信或使用本局小车去四川、云南交界处接烟；或身着警服随车押运，甚至携枪“护驾”。他们还向厂方出示工作证、持枪证、手枪等以骗取信任。
    为此，中共宜宾地委、宜宾县人民政府分别对宜宾县公安局倒卖卷烟的有关人员作出严肃处理：
    宜宾县县委委员、县政府领导小组成员、县公安局长、局党委副书记吕泽荣同志，参与、支持投机倒把活动，认错态度不好，决定给予撤销其县委委员、局党委副书记、委员职务和行政降职处分。
    宜宾县公安局党委书记、县人大常委会委员严国灿，支持投机倒把活动，鉴于认错较好，决定给予党内严重警告处分，建议依法罢免其县人大常委会委员职务。　　宜宾县公安局党委委员、分管刑侦的副局长郭祥明，能老实交代自己的错误，决定给予党内严重警告、行政记大过处分。
    政保科科长毛崇汉带领干警先后５次参与倒卖卷烟计５．９万条，经营额达２６万元，并在倒卖活动中闯关抗税，边查边犯，决定留党察看一年，行政上撤销政保科科长职务。
    刑警队副队长袁安德除组织刑警队倒卖卷烟外，还倒卖化肥３０吨，非法牟利３２００元，决定开除党籍，建议司法机关依法追究刑事责任（已逮捕）。
    对涉及本案的其他干警，给予严肃批评教育；对宜宾县公安局党委进行整顿和教育。
    此外，对本案涉及宜宾县烟草公司，泥溪、安边区供销社的有关责任人员，由宜宾县委、县政府处理。
