Syrian Prime Minister Meets Chinese Ambassador, Hopes for Stability in China

	BEIJING, June 18 (Xinhua) -- A Syrian government official said today that the disturbances in China were instigated by a small group of people and that it was necessary for the Chinese government to take firm measures to stop them.

	Syrian Prime Minister Mahmoud Zu'bi recently met with the Chinese Ambassador to Syria and expressed his sincere hope that the situation in China would return to normal as soon as possible.

	The Syrian official also criticized some Western countries for using the pretext of human rights to interfere in China's internal affairs.

	A Syrian businessman pointed out that some Western news agencies seemed to wish for chaos in China. They have been reporting extensively about Chinese troops using large numbers of tanks to suppress students and fabricating exaggerated figures for civilian casualties. These reports are not credible and are motivated by ulterior purposes.

	The businessman concluded by expressing his hope, as a true friend of China, that China would quickly and completely end the disturbances, stabilize the situation, and continue to prosper and grow stronger.

　　叙利亚总理会见我大使时表示
    希望中国局势恢复平静
    本报大马士革６月１８日电  记者吕志兴报道：“在中国发生的暴乱是由一小撮人煽动的。中国政府坚决予以制止是非常必要的。”叙利亚总理马哈茂德·祖埃比最近在会见我驻叙大使时，衷心希望中国局势迅速恢复平静。
    叙一位政府官员表示，西方一些国家以所谓“人权”为借口，大肆攻击中国，是干涉中国内政。
    一位叙利亚商人指出，有的西方通讯社唯恐中国不乱，他们连篇累牍地报道中国军队出动大量坦克，压死学生，并编造了惊人的群众伤亡数字，这些都是不可信的。他们的这一行径是别有用心的。这位商人最后表示，作为中国的真正朋友，希望中国尽快彻底结束暴乱，稳定局面，不断繁荣富强。
