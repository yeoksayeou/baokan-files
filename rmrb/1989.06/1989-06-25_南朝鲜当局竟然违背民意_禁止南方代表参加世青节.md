The South Korean authorities have defied public opinion by banning representatives from the "National University Student Representatives Council" from attending the upcoming World Youth Festival in Pyongyang.

The 13th World Youth Festival is scheduled to be held from July 1 to 8 in Pyongyang. On June 21, Lee Hong-ju, the head of the South Korean Unification Board, presided over a meeting of the "South-North Exchange Promotion Committee." During the meeting, it was decided to reject the invitation from the North. Lee Hong-ju announced this decision and declared that anyone who defies the authorities' decision will be handed over to the judicial authorities for processing.

According to another report, the Standing Committee of the International Organizing Committee for the 13th World Youth Festival, in order to enable South Korean student youth to participate in the activities of this festival, dispatched a Belgian representative from the International Socialist Youth Alliance and two other Standing Committee members to Seoul to mediate on June 19. However, due to the South Korean authorities' refusal to allow the delegation to enter the country, the three representatives had to return to Pyongyang via Hong Kong at noon today. They spoke to reporters at the Pyongyang airport, expressing that the South Korean authorities' stance is wrong and goes against the will of young students fighting for justice. Due to the obstruction by the South Korean authorities, a letter from the International Organizing Committee to the South Korean side could not be delivered. They expressed regret over the South Korean authorities' actions.

　　南朝鲜当局竟然违背民意  禁止南方代表参加世青节
    新华社平壤６月２４日电  据此间今天获悉，南朝鲜当局新近决定，不允许南朝鲜“全国大学生代表协议会”派代表参加即将在平壤举行的世界青年联欢节。
    第１３届世界青年联欢节定于７月１日至８日在平壤举行。南朝鲜统一院长官李洪九本月２１日主持召开了一次“南北交流促进委员会会议”，会上作出了拒绝北方邀请的决定。李洪九在宣布这一决定时还宣称，违反当局决定者，将交由司法部门处理。
    另据报道，第１３届世界青年联欢节国际筹委会常设委员会为了使南朝鲜青年学生能参加这届联欢节的活动，曾于６月１９日派遣国际社会主义青年同盟比利时籍代表与另外两名常设委员会委员前往汉城斡旋，但因南朝鲜当局拒绝该代表团入境，这３名代表不得不于今天中午由香港返回平壤。他们在平壤机场对记者发表谈话时表示，南朝鲜当局采取上述立场是错误的，违反了为正义而斗争的青年学生的意愿。由于南朝鲜当局的阻挠，使国际筹委会给南朝鲜方面的一封信也未能转交，他们对南朝鲜当局的这一行动感到遗憾。
