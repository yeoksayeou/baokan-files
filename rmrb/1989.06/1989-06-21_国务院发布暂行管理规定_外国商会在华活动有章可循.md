State Council Premier Li Peng on June 14 signed State Council Order No. 36, issuing the "Provisional Regulations on the Management of Foreign Chambers of Commerce" (full text to be published in tomorrow's fourth edition). These provisional regulations will come into effect on July 1.

The regulations clearly state that foreign chambers of commerce refer to commercial institutions and personnel from foreign countries who, in accordance with regulations, establish non-profit organizations within China that do not engage in any commercial activities. The activities of foreign chambers of commerce should aim to promote trade and economic and technological exchanges between their members and China, providing convenience for their members in studying and discussing the promotion of international trade and economic and technological exchanges. Foreign chambers of commerce must comply with the laws and regulations of the People's Republic of China and must not harm China's national security and public interests.

To establish a foreign chamber of commerce, a written application must be submitted to the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, which will then be reviewed and approved by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade. The Ministry of Civil Affairs will then approve the registration and issue a registration certificate, after which the establishment is considered complete. Foreign chambers of commerce must accept supervision from relevant Chinese authorities. Any foreign chamber of commerce found to be in violation of the provisional regulations will be subject to warnings, fines, suspension of activities, revocation of registration, or dissolution by the registration management authority.

    新华社北京６月２１日电  国务院总理李鹏６月１４日签署国务院第３６号令，发布《外国商会管理暂行规定》（全文见明日第四版），这一《暂行规定》将从７月１日起实施。
    暂行规定明确表明，外国商会是指外国在中国境内的商业机构及人员按照规定在中国境内成立，不从事任何商业活动的非营利性团体。外国商会的活动应以促进其会员同中国发展贸易和经济技术交往为宗旨，为其会员在研究和讨论促进国际贸易和经济技术交往方面提供便利。外国商会必须遵守中华人民共和国法律、法规的规定，不得损害中国的国家安全和社会公共利益。
    成立外国商会，应向中国国际商会提出书面申请，并报送经贸部审查同意，由民政部核准登记并签发登记证书后才为成立。外国商会必须接受中国有关主管机关的监督。凡外国商会违反《暂行规定》的，登记管理机关有权予以警告、罚款、限期停止活动、撤销登记、明令取缔的处罚。
