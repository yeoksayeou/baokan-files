State Council advisors today visited and extended their regards to the troops imposing martial law in the capital. Advisor Chen Xiuhe, on behalf of all the advisors at the State Council, conveyed warm greetings to the People's Liberation Army.

He said, "Most of us advisors at the State Council are in our seventies and eighties, and many of us are from democratic parties or are non-partisan. We have experienced both old and new societies and know that without the Communist Party, there would be no New China. Only socialism can save China. We deeply understand the value of stability and unity. Without a stable and united situation, nothing can be accomplished."

    据新华社北京６月１６日电  国务院参事今天看望和慰问了首都戒严部队某部官兵。陈修和参事代表国务院参事室全体同志向解放军致以亲切的问候。
    他说，我们国务院参事大都是七八十岁的老人，多是民主党派和无党派人士，经历过新旧两种不同的社会，深知没有共产党，就没有新中国，只有社会主义，才能救中国。深知安定团结之可贵，没有安定团结的局面，就什么事情也搞不成。
    据新华社北京６月１６日电　中央文史研究馆６月１５日向２１位馆员传达了邓小平同志接见戒严部队军以上干部时的讲话。馆员们一致表示，拥护中共中央、国务院平息首都反革命暴乱的英明决策，向戒严部队官兵表示崇高的敬意。
    为了表达对戒严部队的情意，馆员中的书画艺术家纷纷挥毫泼墨，为解放军官兵写字作画。解放军某部负责人闻讯赶来，对馆员们一一表示感谢。
