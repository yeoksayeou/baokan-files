Vice Premier and Mayor of Beijing Chen Xitong today, while visiting and comforting the people of Fangshan District and the employees of Yanhua Chemical Company, emphasized the need to mobilize and rely on the masses to participate in quelling the counter-revolutionary riots and production.

Since the counter-revolutionary riots in the capital on June 3, the social order, work order, and production order in Fangshan District have not been greatly disrupted. The average yield of summer grain is expected to increase from 579 jin last year to 650 jin this year. The employees of Yanhua Chemical Company have overcome difficulties and maintained their posts, with an attendance rate of over 97%. In the first five months, the company has accumulated a production value of over 1.4 billion yuan, accounting for 45% of the annual plan. Chen Xitong said to the cadres and masses of Fangshan District and the employees of Yanhua Chemical Company: "In the process of quelling the counter-revolutionary riots, you have maintained a clear stance, firmly guarded your posts, and continued production, making important contributions to the stability of the capital and the restoration of order. On behalf of the Municipal Party Committee, the Municipal Government, and all citizens, I express my gratitude and comfort to you."

Chen Xitong pointed out that we have achieved a decisive victory in quelling the counter-revolutionary riots, but the situation remains severe. At present, we must do two things at the same time: quell the riots and maintain production. Without focusing on production, we cannot stabilize people's minds, which is not conducive to social stability; without quelling the riots, production and life cannot return to normal.

When talking about investigating the counter-revolutionary rioters who engaged in beating, smashing, looting, arson, and murder, as well as the planners and organizers of the riots, Chen Xitong said, "We must eliminate these counter-revolutionary rioters completely, without letting a single one escape. We must unite the majority and isolate the few, rooting them out one by one. Otherwise, we will make historical mistakes."

Chen Xitong demanded that all levels of leadership unite their thoughts with Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech, mobilize the masses, rely on the masses, and actively participate in quelling the riots and production, contributing to the stabilization of the situation and the restoration of order.

　　国务委员、北京市长陈希同强调
    发动群众投入平暴和生产
    新华社北京６月１６日电  （记者刘浦泉）国务委员、北京市市长陈希同今天在慰问房山区人民和燕化公司职工时强调，要发动和依靠群众，投入平息暴乱和生产。
    ６月３日首都发生反革命暴乱以来，房山区社会秩序、工作秩序和生产秩序都未受到大的破坏，今年夏粮平均单产预计可由去年的５７９斤提高到６５０斤。燕化公司广大职工克服困难、坚守岗位，出勤率一直保持在９７％以上，头５个月累计完成产值１４亿多元，占年计划的４５％。陈希同对房山区干部群众和燕化职工说：“在平息反革命暴乱中，你们旗帜鲜明、立场坚定、坚守岗位、坚持生产，为首都稳定大局、恢复秩序做出了重要贡献。我代表市委和市政府以及全体市民向你们表示感谢和慰问。”
    陈希同指出，我们已经取得了平息反革命暴乱的决定性胜利，但局势仍很严峻。目前应一手抓平息暴乱，一手抓坚持生产。不抓好生产，就不能稳定人心，就不利于社会安定；不平息暴乱，生产和生活就无法正常进行。
    陈希同在谈到清查反革命暴乱中的打、砸、抢、烧、杀分子以及暴乱的策划者和组织者时说，对这些反革命暴乱分子要除恶务尽，不让一个漏网，要团结大多数，孤立一小撮，把他们一个个“挖”出来，不然就会犯历史性错误。
    陈希同要求，各级领导把思想统一到邓小平同志讲话上来，放手发动群众，依靠群众，积极投入平暴和生产，为稳定大局、恢复秩序作出贡献。
