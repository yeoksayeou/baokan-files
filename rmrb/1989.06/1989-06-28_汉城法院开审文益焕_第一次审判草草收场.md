Seoul Court Opens Trial of Moon Seung-hwan; First Hearing Ends Hastily

Seoul, June 28th — Amid protests from various sectors of South Korean society, the Seoul District Court hastily concluded the first hearing of Moon Seung-hwan's trial on June 26th.

Moon Seung-hwan visited Pyongyang from March 25th to April 3rd this year. Upon his return to Seoul on April 13th, he was arrested by the authorities. On May 31st, the Seoul District Prosecutor's Office indicted him on charges of "violating the National Security Law."

On that day, more than 100 opposition figures and citizens staged a protest outside the courthouse. To maintain order, the authorities dispatched over 170 police officers to sit in the audience. Some opposition figures and Moon Seung-hwan's family members protested to the court, asserting that such a trial was unjust.

Moon Seung-hwan's defense lawyers argued to the court that the charges against Moon Seung-hwan not only defied the current trends of the times but also violated the spirit of the constitution.

Moon Seung-hwan himself stated in court that he hoped to have the opportunity to openly discuss the issue of Korean reunification. He said that if he were to be charged with violating the current National Security Law and found guilty simply for visiting the North, he would accept the verdict.

Under these circumstances, the court authorities had no choice but to adjourn the day's proceedings. The next hearing is scheduled for July 10th.

　　汉城法院开审文益焕  第一次审判草草收场
    新华社平壤６月２８日电  汉城消息：在南朝鲜各界人士的抗议声中，汉城地方法院２６日对文益焕的第一次审判草草收场。
    文益焕今年３月２５日至４月３日访问了平壤。当他４月１３日返回汉城时遭当局逮捕。５月３１日，汉城地方检察厅以“违反国家保安法”为由对其提出起诉。
    ２６日这一天，法院外面有１００多名在野人士和市民举行抗议活动。当局为了维持秩序，派出了１７０多名警察坐在旁听席上。一些在野人士和文益焕的家属向法庭提出抗议，认为这样的审判是不公正的。
    文益焕的辩护律师们则向法庭提出，对文益焕的指控不仅违背时代潮流，而且也是违反宪法精神的。
    文益焕本人在法庭上表示，他期待着有机会开诚布公地讨论朝鲜民族的统一问题。他说，如果因他访问了北方就指控他违反了现行的保安法并判他有罪，他将接受这种罪名。
    在此情况下，法院当局不得不结束当天的审判。下次审判定于７月１０日举行。
