Yantai in Shandong Province has successfully guided social funds into energy construction. After eight years of effort, it has become one of the regions in China with a relatively abundant electricity supply. Last year, the city's total installed power generation capacity reached 800,000 kilowatts, with an annual power generation of nearly 4 billion kilowatt-hours.

Electricity supply in Yantai has long been tight. Before 1981, the installed power generation capacity was less than 200,000 kilowatts. The shortage of electricity has constrained economic development. The city has abundant lignite resources that can be used for thermal power generation, but due to a lack of funds, these resources could not be utilized. The city, with a long-term development perspective, mobilized and organized the masses to tighten consumption and raise funds for electricity projects. On average, the 16 counties, cities, and districts (including Weihai City) raised 60 million yuan each year, totaling nearly 700 million yuan over several years. Of this amount, 70% was invested by local authorities, which led to the construction of the first power plant in China jointly funded by the central and local governments—the Longkou Pithead Power Plant. Last year, the plant's power generation accounted for 69.2% of Yantai's total, and over the years, it has created a social value of 31 billion yuan. Due to the relatively abundant energy supply, the city has adjusted its industrial structure and optimized its layout, significantly boosting the city's rapid economic development.

　　引导社会资金投入能源建设
    烟台集资办电成效大
    本报讯  山东省烟台市引导社会资金投入能源建设，经过８年努力，目前已成为全国电力供应较充足的地区之一。去年，全市发电装机容量达到８０万千瓦，发电量近４０亿千瓦时。
    烟台电力供应一直很紧张，１９８１年以前，发电装机容量不足２０万千瓦。电力供应不足，经济发展速度受制。本地有丰富的褐煤可供火力发电，却因资金短缺无法利用。该市从长远发展着眼，动员组织群众紧缩消费开支，集资办电。全市１６个县、市、区（含威海市），平均每年集资６０００余万元，几年共完成投资近７亿元，其中７０％由地方投资，建成了我国第一座由中央和地方集资兴建的龙口坑口发电厂，去年发电量占烟台的６９．２％，几年来累计创可计社会价值３１０亿元。由于能源较充足，促使产业结构调整、布局合理，对全市经济迅速起飞起了巨大作用。（于永利）
