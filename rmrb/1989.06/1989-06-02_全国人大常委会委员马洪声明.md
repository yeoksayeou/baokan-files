Edition: 2

	The Hong Kong *Wen Wei Po* on May 25 published a report that several members of the NPC Standing Committee had signed a petition calling for an emergency meeting. I saw this report today for the first time and was deeply surprised. I was in Japan from May 9 to 20 leading a delegation to participate in the Sino-Japanese Economic Knowledge Exchange Conference and was not in the country. Whether I was abroad or before and after my departure, up until now, I have never signed any "petition." I am extremely indignant about this practice of forging signatures to mislead the public. I hereby make this statement.

　　全国人大常委会委员马洪声明
    香港《文汇报》５月２５日登载的若干人大常委签名要求召开紧急会议的消息，我今天才看到。对此，我事前毫不知情，阅后深为诧异。我于５月９日至２０日率团赴日本参加中日经济知识交流会，不在国内。无论在国外，或出国前后，直到现在，我从没有在任何“签名信”上签过名。对这种冒名惑众的做法，极为愤慨。特此声明。
