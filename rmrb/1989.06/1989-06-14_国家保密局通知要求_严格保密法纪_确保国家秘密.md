Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 14th.

The State Secrets Bureau recently issued a notice to the entire country, requiring further strict adherence to secrecy laws and regulations to ensure the safety of state secrets.

The notice states that under the wise decision-making and leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, the counterrevolutionary riots, mainly instigated by a small number of people in the capital Beijing, have been basically suppressed. Among the plotters and organizers of the riots, there are those who have provided important state secrets to illegal organizations. This once again underscores the importance of safeguarding state secrets in maintaining national security and interests, and in maintaining a stable and united political environment.

The notice requires that all regions, departments, and units further strengthen the propaganda and education of the "Secrecy Law," heighten vigilance, and consciously safeguard the security of state secrets. Leading organs and leading cadres must set an example. All levels of secrecy work departments must stand their posts, work hard, and effectively fulfill the responsibilities entrusted by the "Secrecy Law." Serious investigations must be conducted into any leaks of secrets. Those who provide state secrets to illegal organizations must be severely punished according to the law. Those who bravely protect state secrets in the struggle must be commended.

The notice also points out that in areas where disturbances still exist, every organ and unit, especially leading organs, must do a good job of conference secrecy, and manage secret documents, equipment, items, and other secret carriers to prevent leaks and thefts.

    严格保密法纪　确保国家秘密
    新华社北京６月１４日电  国家保密局最近向全国发出通知，要求进一步严格保密法纪，确保国家秘密安全。
    通知说，在党中央、国务院、中央军委的英明决策和领导下，极少数人主要在首都北京制造的反革命暴乱已被基本平息。在暴乱的策划者和组织者中，就有向非法组织提供重要国家秘密的人，这就再一次说明，保守国家秘密对于维护国家的安全和利益，维护安定团结政治局面，是多么重要。
    通知要求，各地区、各部门、各单位进一步加强《保密法》的宣传教育，提高警惕，自觉维护国家秘密的安全。领导机关、领导干部要起模范带头作用。各级保密工作部门要坚守岗位，努力工作，切实履行《保密法》赋予的职责。对泄密事件，要认真查处。对向非法组织提供国家秘密的犯罪分子，要坚决依法严惩。对在斗争中英勇保护国家秘密的干部职工，要给予表彰。
    通知还指出，在尚有动乱的地区，每个机关单位，特别是领导机关，要做好会议保密工作，做好秘密文件资料、设备物品及其它秘密载体的管理工作，以防泄密、窃密事件发生。
