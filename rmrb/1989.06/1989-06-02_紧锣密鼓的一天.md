A Busy Day of Political Shifts

By Yu Qing, People's Daily Correspondent

Surrounding the resignation of Prime Minister Takeshita Noboru, the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) elected Uno Sosuke as its new president and prime minister, and selected new cabinet members. Today, Japan's political arena experienced a day filled with a high-density political agenda and a fast pace.

At 10 AM, LDP Diet members gathered at the LDP headquarters for a meeting. Takeshita announced his resignation as party president. Acting Secretary-General Hashimoto proposed the election of Uno Sosuke as his successor, which was approved by a majority in a standing vote. During the meeting, six individuals proposed former Defense Agency Director Yamashita Genri as a candidate for president, requesting a secret ballot, but this was rejected by the meeting chair.

In his acceptance speech, Uno stated that he would immediately step down from his faction within the party and work towards political reform to restore public trust in politics.

At noon, during an emergency cabinet meeting, Takeshita announced the resignation of the entire cabinet. After serving 575 days in office, Takeshita then went to the Prime Minister's Official Residence to bid farewell to the staff.

At 2 PM, during the House of Representatives session, LDP's Tamura Motonoshin and Social Party's Yasutomo Yasutaka were elected as the new Speaker and Vice-Speaker of the House of Representatives.

Subsequently, during the sessions of the House of Representatives and the House of Councillors, Uno Sosuke was elected as the new Prime Minister, receiving more than half of the votes.

In the evening, the LDP elected new leadership: Secretary-General Hashimoto Ryutaro (Takeshita faction), Chairman of the General Affairs Committee Minoru Mizuno (Miyazawa faction), and Chairman of the Policy Research Council Murata Keijiro (Abe faction).

At around 6:30 PM, Uno Sosuke, as the new Prime Minister, entered the Prime Minister's Official Residence for the first time, working with LDP executives to select new cabinet members.

　　紧锣密鼓的一天
    本报记者  于青
    围绕竹下登辞职，宇野宗佑接任自民党总裁和新内阁总理大臣、选出新内阁成员。今天，日本政界度过了政治日程高密度、快节奏的一天。
    上午十点，自民党国会议员在自民党本部召开会议。竹下登宣布辞去自民党总裁。代理干事长桥本建议推举宇野宗佑接任，以起立形式表决结果，获得多数赞成而通过。其间，有六人发言提议前防卫厅长官山下元利为总裁候选人，要求进行不记名投票表决，被会议主持者否决。宇野在就任总裁致词中表示，从即日起脱离党内派系，努力进行政治改革，以恢复国民对政治的信任。
    中午，在临时内阁会议上，竹下宣布内阁总辞职。然后，执政五百七十五天的竹下来到首相官邸向工作人员告别。
    下午二点举行的众院会议上，自民党的田村元和社会党的安井吉典当选为新众院议长、副议长。
    接着，在先后举行的众院和参院会议上进行指名选举，宇野宗佑均获得过半数赞成票，当选为新内阁总理大臣。
    傍晚，自民党选出新的领导干部：干事长桥本龙太郎（竹下派）、总务会长水野清（宫泽派）、政务调查会长村田敬次郎（安倍派）。
    六点三十分许，宇野宗佑作为首相第一次进入首相官邸，与自民党干部共同着手选定新内阁成员。
