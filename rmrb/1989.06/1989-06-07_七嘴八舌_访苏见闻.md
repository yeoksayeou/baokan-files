We spent 17 days in the Soviet Union, broadly interacting with people from all walks of life. From start to finish, no one refused to answer our questions, even when they were quite sharp and highly sensitive. I once asked the editor of *Moscow News*, Brodetsky, why the Politburo member Ligachov disliked *Moscow News*.

"Whether it's you, us, or Western journalists, everyone is interested in differences of opinion," Brodetsky laughed. "Of course, there are reasons why he doesn't like our weekly. He is a Politburo member, and the Politburo's views have 'legal effects' on the entire country. However, we can also hold onto our opinions."

When we visited the editor-in-chief of *Spark* magazine, Korotich, we asked him, "During the Party Congress or the Supreme Soviet sessions in the Soviet Union, have there been instances where journalists were asked to leave? How do journalists report in such situations?" He could have given a formal response or not answered at all, but he frankly said, "Such situations have occurred, and they happened during this congress. However, journalists can still learn what they want to know and report what they want to report." In fact, the Soviet media promptly reported on the important speeches during this session, especially those with differing views; the voting results of the resolutions, including the exact number of people who voted against, even the fact that 209 delegates voted against the proposal by the General Secretary of the CPSU, Gorbachev, that the first secretary of the party committee at the district level should also be the chairman of the same-level Soviet, and the chairman of the Supreme Soviet "should have sufficient national power," were all reported.

Now, even during regular press conferences in the Soviet Union, journalists can ask any question without being told "no comment." If the host cannot immediately answer a question from a foreign journalist, such as forgetting a number, they will still provide the answer at the next meeting. It is understood that this was unimaginable just three years ago. Now, this practice has spread throughout society and become a trend.

Soviet friends say that the most prominent change in the Soviet Union's three-year-plus reform process is the consistent implementation and continuous expansion of openness. During our visit to the Soviet Union, our extensive and in-depth interactions with people from all walks of life deeply impressed us with the fact that Soviet political life has begun to become lively, breaking the long-standing stagnant political and ideological situation; people dare to speak the truth and speak from the heart; even "heretical" views dare to be "put on the table." After arriving in Moscow, a young Soviet man in his twenties who came to receive us temporarily spoke frankly about current affairs upon first meeting, saying, "We no longer need a great leader, we don't need a 'god,' we only need practical people among the common people." Once, we traveled with some friends from the news media to visit a farm. During the more than three-hour journey, our Soviet colleagues freely discussed various prominent figures in Soviet history in front of us, even touching on the "Cheka" and the "KGB." From our observations, although Soviet people have different views on openness, there is a common point: openness makes them feel relaxed and no longer spiritually oppressed.

The rapid development of the times has posed new challenges to the Soviet Union's political and economic systems.

Facing these challenges requires reform. However, the current Soviet reform encounters obstacles from three aspects—what the Soviets call the "triangular obstacle": resistance from bureaucracy, interference in the ideological sphere, and doubts from the masses. The Soviet approach is to criticize the first obstacle, debate the second, and explain the third, and to achieve all this, one must be brave enough to reflect on history in a realistic manner and correctly evaluate the present. The editor of *Moscow News*, Brodetsky, shared his thoughts with us: "Now, some new principles are difficult for the masses to grasp immediately. Some people who support old ideas often write to the magazine expressing opposition to reform and openness. This is understandable. Many people have become accustomed to the old tracks and find it difficult to change suddenly. For this reason, our publication pays great attention to promoting new concepts, new ideas, and new ways of thinking."

Today, Soviet people are all thinking, and the entire society is participating in the debate. A new atmosphere of not being bound by authority, not being confined by established conclusions, and daring to think and think well is gradually forming.

During a reception, when I mentioned the issue of openness, a political commentator from TASS candidly expressed his opinion: "Openness is good, but it must have constraints and boundaries. Now, some people with ulterior motives are using it, thinking that openness means saying whatever they want and achieving their own goals through openness." "Some people, when re-evaluating history, lack analysis and deny everything." More than ten days later, when we visited the editor-in-chief of *Spark*, his views were almost diametrically opposed to the above. He said: "Implementing openness is seeking truth from facts. But some people say that exposing Stalin's mistakes in suppression is a destruction of our ideals. So, does this mean that to maintain the ideal, we must carry out large-scale suppression? Some people also think that re-evaluating history is to deny achievements and deny everything. Can we not judge history just because we have historical achievements?" Sometimes, Soviet friends would argue quite heatedly in front of us. For example, some believe that Stalin had the background of his era, and his historical merits cannot be completely erased; others express that evaluating history is not to erase history but to clarify the facts and distinguish right from wrong. Some say that the current situation in the Soviet Union is relatively difficult, and people's thoughts are relatively chaotic and confused; others believe that on the contrary, the current diversity of opinions is a sign of the country's courage and confidence. No country in the world is without problems, and the skill of a politician lies in recognizing them and solving them.

Now, if you open Soviet newspapers and magazines, you will feel a sense of debate. Whether it is the exploration of communist theory, the evaluation of historical figures, or the study of political, economic, scientific, artistic, and educational issues, there are various differing opinions in the debate. *Pravda* has opened a new column—"Debate Forum." Other newspapers and magazines have also set up debate platforms. Debate brings change. The media has swept away the past phenomenon of singing the same old tune and continuously publishes articles with new viewpoints, new insights, and new ideas.

The Soviet Union's resolute implementation of openness is a major decision made after accepting the painful lessons of the past half-century, facing the arduous task of reform, and weighing the pros and cons.

As the reform gradually unfolds, it inevitably involves a profound reflection on the path the Soviet Union has taken over the past 70 years. Currently, the question in the minds of Soviet people is how Stalin established the political and economic model that continues to this day and why "cult of personality" appeared; the limitations and reasons for the failure of Khrushchev's reforms; during Brezhnev's 18 years in power, why did society and the economy experience stagnation and crisis, and so on.

"Criticism has no forbidden zones," this is the clear guiding ideology of the Soviet Union's implementation of openness. Of course, there is a social tolerance issue here. At the beginning, some people were concerned that Soviet society could not withstand the impact of various political forces and currents. This concern is not unreasonable. Some people also believe that this tolerance needs to be tempered by various storms, and this tolerance is becoming stronger day by day.

According to our Soviet friends, openness and democratization have further developed in the process of deepening reform in the Soviet Union. Of course, it also has a reasonable limit, that is, it cannot violate the fundamental principles of socialism and the current laws.

　　七嘴八舌
    ——访苏见闻
    徐熊
    我们在苏联１７天，广泛地接触各界人士，从头到尾无一人对我们的提问说过一声“无可奉告”，尽管提出的有些问题相当尖锐，“敏感度”极高。我就曾向《莫斯科新闻》编委布罗杰茨基提出这样一个问题：苏共中央政治局委员利加乔夫为什么不喜欢《莫斯科新闻》。
    “不管是你们，还是我们，还是西方记者，都对分歧感兴趣。”布罗杰茨基不由笑了起来。“他不喜欢我们的周刊当然是有原因的。他是政治局委员，而政治局的看法对全国是有‘法律效果’的。不过，我们也可以保留我们的意见。”
    我们访问《星火》杂志总编辑科罗季奇时，向他提出了这样一个问题：“在苏联举行党代表会议或最高苏维埃会议时，有没有让记者退席的情况发生？这时记者怎样进行报道？”他本来可以“打官腔”或者不回答，然而他却坦率地说：“有这样的情况，在这次大会上就发生过。但是，记者同样可以了解到想要了解的情况，同样可以报道想要报道的事情。”事实上，苏联新闻界及时报道了这次会议的重要发言，特别是有不同看法的言论；决议的表决情况，包括投反对票的具体人数，甚至包括有２０９位代表对苏共中央总书记戈尔巴乔夫的一项建议——区以上党委第一书记兼任同级苏维埃主席，最高苏维埃主席“应享有足够广泛的国家权力”投反对票等内幕性情况。
    现在，苏联即使在平时的记者招待会上，记者什么问题都可以提，从来没有“无可奉告”。对外国记者提出的问题，一时回答不了的，如数字记不清了，主持人在下次会上仍予回答。据了解，这在３年前，是不可想象的。现在这种做法，已波及社会，成为风气。
    苏联朋友说，苏联在三年多改革进程中出现的最突出的变化，就是一直坚持实行和不断扩大公开性。访苏期间，我们与苏联各界人士广泛而深入的接触中，深深感受到苏联的政治生活已开始活跃起来，那种长期形成的死水一潭的政治思想局面已被打破；人们敢于讲真话、讲心里话；哪怕是“异端”的看法也敢“摆在桌面上”。我们到达莫斯科后，临时前来接待我们的是一位２０多岁的苏联青年，初次相识就直言不讳地评说时政，提出“我们不再需要伟大领袖，不需要‘神’，我们只需要凡人中的实干家”。一次，我们与一些新闻界朋友一起乘车去农场访问。在３个多小时路途中，苏联同行们一直毫无顾忌地当着我们的面“侃大山”，评论苏联各个时期的大人物，连对“契卡”和“克格勃”也曾涉及。据我们观察，苏联人对公开性的看法虽然是大相径庭的，但是有一共同点，即公开性使他们心情舒畅，不再感到精神压抑。
    时代的飞跃发展，向苏联的政治体制和经济体制提出了新的挑战。
    面对挑战，就需要改革。可是当今的苏联改革遇到来自三方面的阻力——苏联人称之为“三角形的障碍”，即官僚主义的抵抗，思想领域的干扰，群众的疑虑。苏联对此的作法是对第一个障碍进行批评，对第二个障碍进行辩论，对第三个障碍进行解释，而做到这一切就要勇于对历史做出实事求是的反思和勇于对现实做出正确的评估。《莫斯科新闻》编委布罗杰茨基向我们谈了这样的体会：现在一些新的原则很难一下为群众所掌握。有些支持旧观念的人，经常给杂志来信表示反对改革、反对公开性。这是可以理解的。许多人在旧的轨道上走惯了，一下很难改变嘛。正因为这样，现在我们的刊物很注意宣传新概念、新观念、新思维。
    今天，苏联人都在思考，整个社会舆论都参与论辩。一代不为权威所束缚、不为定论所拘禁、敢想而善想的新风气，正在逐步形成。
    在一次招待会上，当我提到公开性问题时，塔斯社一位政治评论员坦诚发表他的意见：“公开性好是好，但是必须有个约束，有个范围。现在有些别有用心的人就利用它，认为公开性就是我爱说什么就说什么，想通过公开性达到自己的目的。”“有的人在重新评价历史时，缺乏分析，否定一切。”１０多天后，当我们访问《星火》总编辑时，他的看法跟上述观点几乎是针锋相对。他说：“实行公开性就是实事求是。可是有人说，把斯大林搞镇压的错误端出来，是对我们理想的破坏。那么这是不是说，要保持理想，就得搞大镇压？还有人认为对历史重新评价是否定成绩，否定一切。难道有了历史成就，就不能评判？”有时，苏联朋友还当着我们的面十分激烈地互相辩论起来。例如，有的认为，斯大林有斯大林时代的背景，他的历史功绩不能一概抹煞；有人表示，评价历史不是要抹煞历史，而是要搞清事实，分清是非。有人讲，现在苏联处境比较困难，人们思想比较动荡、比较混乱；有人则认为恰恰相反，现在众说纷纭，正是国家充满勇气和信心的表现。世界上没有哪个国家没有难题，政治家的本领就在于认识它，并且解决它。
    现在打开苏联报刊，就会感到有争鸣气氛。无论是对共产主义中理论的探讨、对历史人物的评价，还是对政治、经济、科技、文艺、教育问题的研究，都有各种不同意见在争论。《真理报》还开辟了新的专栏——“争论论坛”。其他一些报刊也设了争鸣阵地。辩论带来了变化。舆论界一扫过去那种千篇一律唱老调的现象，不断刊出有新观点、新见解和新思想的文章。
    苏联坚决进行公开性是接受过去半个世纪的沉痛教训，面临艰巨的改革任务，权衡利弊而采取的重大抉择。
    随着改革逐步展开，就必然涉及对苏联７０年所走过的道路的深刻反思。眼下，在苏联人心目中所出现的问题是斯大林如何确立延续至今的政治经济模式和为什么出现“个人迷信”；赫鲁晓夫的改革的局限性和失败的原因；勃列日涅夫当政１８年，社会经济为什么出现停滞和危机，等等。
    “批评没有禁区”，这是苏联实行公开性时明确的指导思想。这里当然有个社会承受力的问题。在开始，有人担心苏联社会承受不了各种政治力量和思潮的冲击。这种担心不是没有道理的。也有人认为，这种承受力要经过各种风浪锤炼，这种承受力反而日益增强了。
    据苏联朋友介绍，公开性、民主化在苏联改革深化过程中进一步发展。当然，它也有个合理的限度，那就是不能触犯社会主义的根本原则与现行的法规。
