Foreigners estimate that Chinese people smoke one trillion cigarettes a year, and they are eager to tap into this vast potential market. Four years ago, the *Yangcheng Evening News* published an article titled "Beware! They Are Watching Us." Two years later, foreign cigarettes indeed formed a "strange circle" in China.

A certain young worker earns less than a hundred yuan a month, but his pockets are always filled with foreign cigarettes. He calls them "status cigarettes," claiming that not smoking foreign cigarettes makes one look uncool and unable to get by. But since he doesn't have much money, he has to put on a brave face.

Smoking "foreign cigarettes" has become a trend among the youth. Apart from impacting domestic industries, it also affects some people's thinking. It's not that using foreign goods is a national disgrace, but an irrational worship of foreign goods is worrisome. We introduce advanced technology, equipment, management experience, capital, and talent from abroad to develop social productivity and strengthen self-reliance. Using limited foreign exchange to import large quantities of high-end consumer goods is definitely not a smart move.

It's strange that in the eyes of many, "foreign cigarettes" are no longer just small "white sticks," but have become symbols of social life and social attitudes. Apart from being a "status symbol," they are also a symbol of power. China is a country that values status. At the entrance of hotels, if you are dressed in a suit and tie and look healthy, you are considered a guest. If you dress modestly, you might be turned away. "Blue Bird," "Mercedes," and "Crown" cars can be parked anywhere, while a "Shanghai" car has to park on the side. Similarly, smoking high-end foreign cigarettes implies that one is wealthy and superior! Just look at the big and small meetings; how many people are smoking "Health" or "Marlboro"? And how many of these people actually buy these cigarettes with their own money? If these people really bought the foreign cigarettes themselves, many of them would have long been eating the wind from the northwest!

"Foreign cigarettes" also act as a lubricant for individual business owners and township enterprise managers when they go out to socialize. Offering a foreign cigarette is considered a "small gesture," and in private, giving a few cartons can turn obstacles into smooth paths. Buying in bulk for future use, "small money for big money," is worth it!

As a result, unlicensed cigarette vendors, despite the fluctuations in cigarette prices, remain undeterred and are a common sight on the streets of various cities. The tobacco company, public security, industry and commerce, and urban management departments should all be involved, but no one is taking action. If the source of black-market cigarettes is not blocked, isn't that like treating the symptoms instead of the cause? No wonder people complain: "Those who should manage don't manage, it's unacceptable!"

### “外烟”之怪

　　“外烟”之怪
    文洪
    外国人估计中国人一年吸掉一万亿支香烟，对这巨大的潜在市场，他们垂涎三尺。四年前，《羊城晚报》曾载文《当心！他们盯着我们》。两年后，外烟果真在中国形成了一个“怪圈”。
    某青工月工资不足百元，但口袋里外烟不断，说这是“排场烟”，不抽外烟不神气，吃不开。但手里“票子”不多，只好打肿脸充胖子。
    吸“外烟”在青年中成为一种时髦，除冲击民族工业外，也冲击了一些人的思想。不是说用洋货就是一种国耻，但对洋货的非冷静崇拜就值得警惕。我们引进国外的先进技术设备、管理经验、资金和人才，根本的宗旨是为了发展社会生产力，也可以加强自力更生的基础。而把有限的外汇用来引进大批高档消费品，绝不是一着好棋。
    说来也怪，“外烟”在不少人眼里，已经不是一根小小的“白棍”，却已成了社会生活、社会心态的一个标志。除“身份证明”之外，它更是一种权力的象征。中国是重身份的国度，宾馆门口看到你西装革履、气色红润便视作上客，衣着朴素则有拒之门外的可能。“蓝鸟”、“奔驰”、“皇冠”可随意停放，“上海”就只好靠边。同样，抽高档“外烟”便暗示囊中殷实，暗示至尊无上！试看那大大小小的会议，几多人抽的不是“健牌”、“万宝路”？而这些人又有多少是自己掏钱买的呢？如果真是各位自费购买“外烟”，其中许多人早就会喝西北风了。
    “外烟”也给个体户、乡镇企业的厂长们外出周旋增添了润滑剂，递上支“外烟”早已是“小意思”，在无人处塞上几条即可“天堑变通途”。整箱买进以作备用，“小钱换大钱”，值得！
    由此，无证烟贩在经受了烟价的起起伏伏之后依然雄风不减，成为各城市街头一景。烟草公司、公安部门、工商部门、城管部门都该管，可谁也不管。不堵黑市香烟的来源，岂非舍本逐末？难怪人们发牢骚：“该管的不管，不像话！”
