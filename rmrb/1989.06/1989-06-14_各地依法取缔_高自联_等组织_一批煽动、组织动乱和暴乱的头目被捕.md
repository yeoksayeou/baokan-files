Xinhua News Agency, June 14th.

Various places lawfully dissolve the "High Autonomy League" and other organizations. A batch of instigators and organizers of turmoil and riots have been arrested.

The wanted notice issued by the Beijing Public Security Bureau was broadcast on Central Television for just one hour, and Zhou Fengsuo, one of the leaders of the Beijing "High Autonomy League," who had fled back to Xi'an, was apprehended by local public security officers.

According to information provided by the Xi'an Public Security Bureau this morning: Last night at around 7 PM, Zhou Yinhong, an official of the Xi'an Health Bureau, saw on the television screen that the wanted list included her brother Zhou Fengsuo, and immediately discussed the matter with her husband Yang Yibao, who works as a propaganda officer at the Air Force Engineering Academy. They promptly reported the case to the academy's security department. They accurately provided the important clues that Zhou Fengsuo had returned to Xi'an by train from Beijing on June 7 and was currently staying at his brother Zhou Jianen's house in the Daguangming Glasses Store in the western suburbs of Sanqiao Town. At around 8:20 PM, Zhou Fengsuo was captured. The entire operation took only one hour.

The Ministry of Public Security reported: After the wanted notice issued by the Beijing Public Security Bureau was broadcast by Central Television on the evening of the 13th, by the early morning of the 14th, the leader of the Beijing "High Autonomy League," Xiong Yan, was captured.

At 3 AM on June 14th, the Inner Mongolia Public Security Department received a report from the Ningxia Public Security Department that Xiong Yan, who was wanted by the Ministry of Public Security, had fled on the 13th by taking the 170th passenger train from Yinchuan to Baotou. The Inner Mongolia Public Security Department immediately deployed interception measures. At 4:04 AM, when the 170th train arrived at the Fengzhen County station in Inner Mongolia, seven officers from the Fengzhen County Public Security Bureau and the station police station boarded the train and captured Xiong Yan. The Datong Railway Public Security Sub-bureau of Shanxi has sent personnel to escort Xiong Yan back to Datong and prepare to transfer him to Beijing.

The People's Government of Changsha City, Hunan Province, issued a notice on June 12th, dissolving the illegal organizations "Hunan University Student Self-Governance Federation" and "Changsha City Workers' Self-Governance Federation."

The notice stated that the above two illegal organizations must immediately disband and cease all activities; their leaders must register with the local public security authorities within 5 days of the publication of the notice. Those who refuse to register and continue their activities will be severely punished by law.

The Shanghai Municipal Government announced on June 10th that the "Shanghai University Student Self-Governance Federation" is an illegal organization. Yesterday afternoon, the "High Autonomy League" of Tongji University, East China University of Chemical Technology, Shanghai Normal University, and other universities successively posted notices in their campuses, announcing the cessation of activities and the dissolution of the organization.

The three loudspeakers set up by the "Democratic Association" (i.e., "Tongji High Autonomy League") inside and outside Tongji University have been removed. Students and teachers from more than ten universities, including Shanghai Jiaotong University, Shanghai Normal University, and Tongji University, began to clean up the campuses, removing posted slogans and leaflets. Some leaders of the "High Autonomy League" in various universities actively sought out school leaders and school public security and security departments, as well as called the public security authorities to inquire about registration procedures; some have confessed and exposed their participation in the illegal activities of the "High Autonomy League," handing over some items used for illegal activities.
