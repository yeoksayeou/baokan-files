Xinhua News Agency, Taiyuan, June 21st.

The manager, Hao Lichang, and deputy manager, Wen Yuhui, of a company in Shanxi that collectively divided 670,000 yuan in "kickbacks" have recently been arrested and detained respectively.

An investigation revealed that in July and August 1988, the Jinhua Machinery Parts Factory in Taiyuan's northern suburbs purchased electrolytic copper from this company. Deputy Manager Wen Yuhui proposed to the other party that each ton of electrolytic copper be priced at 14,500 yuan, with 5,500 yuan to be paid in cash without an invoice. The company sold 7.1 tons of electrolytic copper to the other party in two transactions, receiving a total of 385,000 yuan in cash without an invoice, which was not recorded in the accounts and was handed over to the company's cashier for safekeeping. On August 31, Hao Lichang and Wen Yuhui announced that this large sum of money would be distributed as a subsidy for purchasing refrigerators for the company's staff. As a result, 12 out of the 13 employees of the entire company each received 3,210 yuan in cash, and both Hao Lichang and Wen Yuhui also received a share.

In June 1988, the Metallurgical and Non-Ferrous Metals Company of Zhanjiang City, Guangdong Province, contacted this company to purchase electrolytic copper. Hao Lichang proposed to the other party to exchange electrolytic copper for 13 units of original 18-inch color TVs produced by Japan, and then sell 15.7 tons of electrolytic copper to the other party at a price of 9,200 yuan per ton. The other party sold 13 units of color TVs priced at 3,650 yuan each to the Shanxi Non-Ferrous Metals Industry Company at 1,400 yuan each, and the company extorted a discount of 292,500 yuan from this. Hao Lichang and Wen Yuhui distributed the TVs and invoices (priced at 3,650 yuan) to the company's employees, with each TV actually receiving only 1,400 yuan in cash, and each employee actually receiving 2,250 yuan.

After the case was exposed, the employees of this company have returned all the "kickbacks" they received.

    新华社太原６月２１日电  集体私分６．７万元“回扣”款的山西有色金属工业公司经理郝立昌、副经理文宇辉最近分别被依法逮捕和拘留。
    经查，１９８８年７、８月间，太原市北郊区晋华机械配件厂向这家公司购买电解铜时，公司副经理文宇辉向对方提出，每吨电解铜为１．４５万元，其中５５００元要付现金，不开发票。这个公司两次卖给对方电解铜７．１吨，共收不开发票的现金３．８５万元，不上帐交给公司出纳员保存。８月３１日，郝立昌和文宇辉宣布，将这笔巨款作为公司人员购买电冰箱的补助款分给大家，结果全公司１３名职工有１２人每人分得现金３２１０元，郝立昌和文宇辉也各得一份。
    １９８８年６月，广东省湛江市冶金有色金属公司与这家公司联系购买电解铜。郝立昌向对方提出以电解铜串换１３台日产原装１８英寸彩电，然后以每吨９２００元的价格卖给对方电解铜１５．７吨，对方将１３台单价３６５０元的日产彩电以１４００元售给山西省有色金属工业公司，该公司从中索贿折价２．９２５万元。郝立昌和文宇辉两人将彩电和发票（３６５０元）分给公司职工，每台彩电只实收现金１４００元，每个职工实得款２２５０元。
    案发后，这家公司职工已将所得“回扣”款全部退出。
