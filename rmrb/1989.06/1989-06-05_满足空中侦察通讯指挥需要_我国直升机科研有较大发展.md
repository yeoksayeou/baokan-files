According to a report from the *Science and Technology Daily*, it was recently learned from the aviation industry that China's helicopter industry, which has been relatively weak and started later than other aircraft industries, is expected to see significant development in the future. Currently, the Z-9 helicopter has been delivered to domestic users, and the Z-8 helicopter is also scheduled to be delivered soon.

Due to historical reasons, China's helicopter industry started about a decade later than other aircraft industries. The development of helicopter models has been in a state of instability, with weak technological foundations and various experimental facilities. The production capacity has not been able to meet the country's defense and economic construction needs for helicopters.

To introduce a competitive mechanism and gradually integrate the scattered helicopter research and production forces into a cohesive unit from research, production to business operations, the State Council approved the establishment of the China Helicopter Technology Development Corporation in October last year. Experts analyzed that the establishment of this corporation can improve the efficiency of China's helicopter research costs by about 20%.

Currently, there are two types of helicopters that have been delivered and are about to be delivered to users. The Z-8 helicopter is a large single-rotor helicopter with a tail rotor, jointly developed by Changhe Aircraft Manufacturing Factory and the China Helicopter Design Research Institute. Its maximum takeoff weight is 13 tons, and it can be widely used for patient evacuation, external load transportation, search and rescue, and other purposes. The Z-9 helicopter is a light, twin-engine, multi-purpose, high-speed helicopter produced by Harbin Aircraft Manufacturing Corporation using technology from the French aerospace company. It has a high cruising speed and large effective load, and can be widely used for personnel transportation, maritime patrol, forest fire prevention, aerial photography, and other purposes.

According to authoritative sources, China's helicopter industry is expected to see significant development in the future. The development of a light helicopter with a total takeoff weight of two tons has been approved by the state in early this year. Its development will fully consider the needs of both military and civilian sectors, meeting the requirements for aerial reconnaissance, communication, command, forest protection, exploration, pursuit, and other purposes. The development of modified versions of the Z-8 and Z-9, as well as other models, is also in the planning and preliminary research stages.

　　满足空中侦察通讯指挥需要
    我国直升机科研有较大发展
    本报讯  据《科技日报》记者日前从航空工业部门获悉，过去我国起步较晚，处于薄弱状况的直升机工业今后将会有较大发展。目前，直九飞机已交付国内用户使用，直八飞机也将在近期内交付使用。
    由于历史上的原因，我国直升机工业相对其他飞机工业起步晚十几年，机型的研制一直处于上上下下的不稳定状态，技术基础和各种试验设施也比较薄弱，生产能力与我国国防和经济建设对直升机的需求很不适应。
    为了引入竞争机制，逐步将分散的直升机科研生产力量凝聚成从科研、生产到经营配套成龙的统一体，去年１０月国家批准成立了中国直升机技术开发实业公司。据专家分析介绍，成立该公司可使我国直升机的科研费用效率提高２０％左右。
    目前，我国已交付和正要交付用户使用的有两种机型。直八直升机是由昌河飞机制造厂与中国直升机设计研究所共同研制的单旋翼带尾桨式大型直升机，其最大起飞重量１３吨，可广泛用于病员救护、外挂运输、搜索救援等；直九直升机是哈尔滨飞机制造公司引进法国宇航公司技术专利生产的一种具有８０年代先进水平的轻型双发多用途快速直升机，其巡航速度高、有效载荷大，可广泛用于人员运输、海上巡逻、护林防火、空中摄影等。
    据权威人士透露，今后我国的直升机工业可望得到较大发展。其中起飞总重为二吨的轻型直升机的研制已在今年初由国家批准立项，它的研制将充分考虑军、民两方面的要求，满足空中侦察、通信指挥以及护林、探测、追捕等各种用途的需要。直八、直九的改型机及其它机型的研制也正在方案论证和预研之中。
