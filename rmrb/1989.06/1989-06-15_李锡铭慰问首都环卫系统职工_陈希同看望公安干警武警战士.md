At the same time, they also protected and rescued more than 700 injured PLA soldiers.

Li Ximing said that the facts have proven that the capital's sanitation team is a reliable force and has brought honor to the working class of the capital.

Li Ximing, on behalf of the Municipal Committee, the Municipal Government, and all the people of the city, expressed his sincere regards and high respect to the sanitation workers and their families.

    李锡铭说，事实证明，首都环卫队伍是过得硬的，为首都工人阶级争了光。
    李锡铭代表市委、市政府和全市人民向环卫职工和他们的家属表示亲切慰问和崇高敬意。
