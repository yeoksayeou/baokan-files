Over the past period, South Korea's political situation has been in turmoil, causing economic development to suffer setbacks. President Roh Tae-woo was forced to postpone his planned visit to Japan in late May. This situation has attracted the attention of various countries in Asia.

	Workers and students strike

In March, tens of thousands of subway workers in Seoul went on strike, demanding higher wages. Subsequently, workers from Seoul to various provinces and cities followed suit, demanding improved working conditions and benefits, and protesting against the government's suppression of the workers' movement. Currently, the workers' movement is shifting from being fragmented to becoming a unified force against the government.

At the end of April, to celebrate the "May Day" International Labor Day, the "National Wage Increase Struggle Headquarters," organized by workers, planned to hold a rally of 100,000 workers on April 30 on Yeouido Island. Fifty-eight organizations, including opposition parties, provided support. However, the police implemented the "Emergency Order No. 1" starting from April 28, deploying over 40,000 police officers to seal off Yeouido Island. Despite this, over 90,000 workers and students across South Korea held demonstrations in various locations on May 1. The police arrested over 1,000 people.

One notable feature of this struggle is the large number of participants and the prolonged duration. In addition to workers in industrial and mining enterprises, government employees, hospital staff, and teachers also joined the demonstrators. Another feature is that students, who previously focused solely on demanding democracy, are now supporting the workers' movement. In South Korea's 104 universities, 55 have completely stopped classes, and 13 have attendance rates below 50%. The struggle continues.

	Economic development hindered

Due to frequent worker strikes, major enterprises are operating at reduced capacity, and some small and medium-sized enterprises have closed. Since February, production has been stagnating, export plans have not been fulfilled, and trade with the United States and Japan has significantly decreased. By the end of April, both exports and manufacturing production had decreased by 6% compared to the same period last year. Additionally, the appreciation of the South Korean won has led to a trade deficit starting in March. According to official announcements, labor disputes have caused losses of $600 million just this year. To reduce economic losses, the government plans to reduce imports and promote investment. Roh Tae-woo has called for dialogue between labor and management to resolve issues.

	Political scandal exposed

Since April, a political scandal surrounding the by-election for a National Assembly seat has added to the already turbulent political situation.

During the 13th National Assembly election last year, the ruling Democratic Justice Party's candidate Hong Su-byeong in Donghae City was found to have committed election fraud and was disqualified in March this year. To fill this vacancy, the opposition Democratic Party's Secretary-General Seo Se-hye was caught bribing the opposition Republican Party's candidate Lee Hong-sik to withdraw from the election. After the incident was exposed, the ruling Democratic Justice Party secured the seat, and Seo Se-hye and Lee Hong-sik were arrested. They are expected to be sentenced to up to five years in prison and fined between 500,000 and 2.5 million South Korean won (approximately 800 South Korean won to 1 USD). Kim Young-sam was also questioned by the police and publicly apologized to Kim Jong-pil and the people of South Korea. This incident has intensified conflicts between opposition parties and between opposition parties and the ruling party.

	One wave after another

On April 28, another incident occurred when Democratic Party lawmaker Shin Wan-gyu assaulted a police officer, leading to the collective resignation of 3,000 local and public security police officers. On May 3, students at Busan Dongui University set fire to six police officers, ultimately leading to the resignation of the Public Security Minister.

Currently, these issues are causing chaos that will not be resolved in the short term. The government has announced that it will hold an extraordinary session of the National Assembly next week to discuss the current crisis. However, labor disputes, student movements, and party conflicts have always been major problems in South Korea. It is estimated that there will be no peaceful days in the first half of this year.

### 南朝鲜政局纷争四起

　　南朝鲜政局纷争四起
    新华社记者  黎能清
    近一个时期以来，南朝鲜政局纷争四起，动荡不已，致使经济发展受到挫折，卢泰愚总统也被迫推迟５月下旬访问日本的计划，这一局势引起了亚洲各国的关注。
    　　　　工潮学潮迭起
    ３月份，数万名汉城地铁工人罢工，要求提高工资。接着从汉城到各道、市的工人陆续响应，要求改善工作条件和待遇，抗议当局对工人运动的镇压。目前，工人运动正在由分散走向联合，形成一股强大的反政府力量。
    ４月底，为了庆祝“五一”国际劳动节，由工人自发组织的“全国提高工资斗争本部”计划４月３０日在汝矣岛召开１０万人的“劳动者”大会，有包括在野党在内的５８个团体作后援。但警方从４月２８日起实施“甲号非常警务”令，出动４万多名警察封锁了汝矣岛。尽管如此，南朝鲜全境９万多名工人和学生于５月１日在各地分别举行示威斗争。警方逮捕了１０００多人。
    这次斗争的特点之一是，参加示威和罢工的人数多，持续时间长。除工矿企业的工人外，政府职员、医院职工和教师等也加入了示威罢工者的行列。特点之二是，过去单纯要求民主的学生也声援工人运动。在南朝鲜１０４所大学中，有５５所大学全部罢课，１３所大学的开学率不足５０％。目前斗争仍在继续。
    　　　　经济发展受阻
    由于工人不断罢工，各大企业开工不足，一些中小企业倒闭。自２月份以来，生产不断钝化，出口计划不能兑现，与美国、日本的贸易大大减少。截至４月止，出口和制造业生产都比去年同期下降了６％，加之南朝鲜货币升值，３月份开始出现贸易赤字。据官方宣布，仅今年以来因劳资纠纷带来的损失达６亿美元。为了减少经济损失，当局计划减少进口，促进投资，卢泰愚呼吁劳资双方开展对话，协商解决问题。
    　　　　政治丑闻曝光
    ４月份以来，围绕国会议员补选发生的政治丑闻给动荡不安的政局雪上加霜。
    去年１３届国会议员选举时，东海市执政的民正党所属议员候选人洪熙标作弊当选，今年３月事发后被取消议员资格。为争夺这一缺位，金泳三领导的在野党民主党事务总长徐锡宰私下贿赂金钟泌领导的在野共和党议员候选人李洪燮，要求李退出竞选。事情败露后，议员缺位被执政的民正党夺走，徐锡宰和李洪燮被捕，将分别被处５年以下徒刑，罚款５０万至２５０万南朝鲜元（约８００南朝鲜元合１美元）。金泳三也遭到警方传讯，并分别向金钟泌和全体南朝鲜人民公开道歉。这一事件加剧了在野党之间、在野党和执政党之间的矛盾。
    　　　　一波未平　一波又起
    ４月２８日，又发生了民主党议员沈完求殴打警察事件，导致３０００名地方和治安本部警察集体辞职。５月３日，釜山东医大学示威学生烧死６名警察，最终导致治安本部部长的辞职。
    从目前来看，这些问题所引起的混乱短期内无法消除。当局已宣布将在下周举行临时国会，讨论当前面临的危机。但劳资纠纷、学生运动、党派斗争历来是南朝鲜的最大问题，估计今年上半年不会有安宁的日子。
