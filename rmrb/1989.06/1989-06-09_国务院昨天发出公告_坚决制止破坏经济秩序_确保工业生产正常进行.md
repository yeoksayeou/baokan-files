Notice of the State Council on Resolutely Stopping Disruption of the Economic Order and Ensuring Normal Industrial Production

In recent days, the struggle to quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing has achieved initial success. However, a small number of rioters and malicious elements, unwilling to accept their defeat, have been spreading rumors and inciting the masses. They have also instigated some students to give speeches in factories, even blocking factory gates, preventing workers from going to work, cutting off factory transportation, inciting workers to strike, and disrupting production. Their goal is to sabotage the economy, create chaos nationwide, and ultimately overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system. We must be vigilant against this evil plot by a small number of reactionaries, take decisive measures, fully expose it, and mobilize and rely on the broad masses of workers to resolutely combat their disruptive actions. To maintain normal economic order and ensure the normal operation of industrial production, the following is announced:

1. Local people's governments and industrial production management departments at all levels should regard ensuring the normal operation of industrial production as an important task and take practical and effective measures to grasp it. They should rely on the broad masses of workers, give full play to the role of trade union organizations at all levels, maintain factory production order, and ensure the normal operation of industrial production.

2. No one is allowed to besiege factories, mines, and enterprises under any pretext, disrupt traffic order, or prevent workers from going to work. The disruptive actions of a small number of malicious elements must be fully exposed and dealt with according to law.

3. Public security departments and armed police forces at all levels should strengthen the protection of key enterprises; allocate appropriate forces to assist production enterprises in maintaining public order. The small number of malicious elements who disrupt production must be firmly struck down without mercy.

4. The working class is the main force of industrial production. They should uphold the spirit of being masters of the country, overcome difficulties, stay at their posts, and do a good job in production. Any speeches or linking activities that disrupt production must be firmly refuted and stopped. If necessary, "factory protection teams" can be organized to protect factories and the labor achievements of workers, and maintain the normal production order of factories.

5. Leaders at all levels should organize the broad masses of workers to study the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Nation" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, do a good job in ideological and political work, and make the broad masses of workers realize that doing a good job in their duties and production is a practical action to maintain national stability and the immediate interests of workers. They should unite as one, work together, and strive to create a good economic order and production environment.

The above points should be widely publicized and strictly implemented in all places.

    国务院关于坚决制止破坏经济秩序确保工业生产正常进行的公告
    近日来，北京平息反革命暴乱的斗争已取得了初步胜利。但是，极少数暴乱分子和别有用心的坏人不甘心他们的失败，到处制造和散布谣言，蛊惑群众，并煽动一些学生到工厂演讲，甚至堵塞工厂大门，阻止工人上班，切断工厂交通，煽动工人罢工，使生产无法正常进行，企图通过搞垮经济来搞乱全国，进而达到推翻共产党的领导和社会主义制度的目的。对极少数反动分子的这一罪恶阴谋，必须提高警惕，采取果断措施，充分予以揭露，并发动和依靠广大职工群众，对他们的破坏行为作坚决的斗争。为了维护正常的经济秩序，确保工业生产的正常进行，特公告如下：
    一、各级人民政府和工业生产主管部门，要把保障工业生产的正常进行作为一项重要任务，采取切实有力的措施抓紧抓好。要依靠广大职工群众，充分发挥各级工会组织的作用，维护工厂的生产秩序，确保工业生产的正常进行。
    二、任何人不得以任何借口围困厂矿企业，破坏交通秩序，阻止工人上班。对于极少数坏人煽动破坏生产的行为，要予以充分揭露，并依法惩处。
    三、各地公安部门和武警部队，要加强对重要企业的保卫工作；要抽调适当力量，协助生产企业维护好治安秩序。对破坏生产的极少数坏人，要坚决打击，绝不手软。
    四、工人阶级是工业生产的主力军，要发扬主人翁的精神，克服困难，坚守岗位，搞好生产。对于破坏生产秩序的任何演说、串联活动，都要坚决予以批驳和阻止。必要时，可组织“护厂队”，保卫工厂和工人的劳动成果，维护工厂的正常生产秩序。
