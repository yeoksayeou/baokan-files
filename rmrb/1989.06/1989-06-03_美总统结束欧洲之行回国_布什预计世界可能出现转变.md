	U.S. President Ends European Trip and Returns Home;
	Bush Predicts Possible Global Shift

	People's Daily, Washington, June 2nd, Reporter Zhang Qixun:

	U.S. President Bush concluded his week-long European trip and arrived back at Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, this noon.

	At the airport, Bush addressed the welcoming crowd, stating that the recently concluded NATO summit was a victory for the entire alliance, a victory for ideals and hope. He said that the U.S. proposal for arms reduction was a bold and fair suggestion, which received approval from all the allied nations. The consensus reached by NATO on short-range nuclear weapons in Europe demonstrated that the alliance could manage changes in the situation while maintaining its deterrent strategy.

	Bush said that the NATO summit also indicated that Western allies were ready to work together to rebuild a new world. The declaration issued by the summit was not a haughty challenge to the Soviet Union but a sincere appeal. He told the American people, "We must, while strengthening our defenses and remaining vigilant, begin working to end the Cold War."

	Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 2nd:

	U.S. President Bush said in an interview with the Washington Post on June 2nd that the world might be undergoing a historic shift from East-West military confrontation to a focus on global economic relations, and that U.S. policy towards the Soviet Union would also undergo "substantial" changes.

	Bush said that the Soviet Union might be undergoing "drastic changes," and that the U.S. and other Western countries should no longer regard containing a militarily aggressive Soviet Union as their fundamental principle. He said this indicated that a unified Europe without man-made borders might emerge.

    美总统结束欧洲之行回国
    布什预计世界可能出现转变
    本报华盛顿6月2日电  记者张启昕报道：美国总统布什结束一周的欧洲之行，今天中午乘飞机返抵新罕布什尔州朴次茅斯的皮斯空军基地。
    布什在机场向欢迎人群发表讲话时称，不久前结束的北约首脑会议是整个联盟的胜利，是理想和希望的胜利。他说，美国提出的裁军建议是大胆而公平的建议，得到各个盟国的赞成；北约在欧洲短程核武器上达成的一致，显示出这个联盟能够驾驭形势的变化，同时保持其威慑战略。
    布什说，北约首脑会议还表明，西方盟国准备协力重建一个新的世界。会议发表的宣言不是对苏联的傲慢挑战，而是真诚的呼吁。他对美国人民说，“我们必须在加强防务，保持警惕的同时，为结束冷战而开始工作”。
    新华社华盛顿6月2日电美国总统布什2日在接受《华盛顿邮报》记者采访时说，世界也许正在发生从东西方军事对抗走向注重全球经济关系的历史性转变，美国的对苏政策也将发生“实质性”变化。
    布什说，苏联也许正处在“急剧变革”之中，美国和西方其他国家不应该再把遏制具有军事侵略性的苏联作为它们的基本原则。他说，这表明将会出现一个没有人为边界的统一的欧洲。
