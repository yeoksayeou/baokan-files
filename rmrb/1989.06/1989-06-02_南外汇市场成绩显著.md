The Southern foreign exchange market has achieved remarkable results. Starting from last May, Yugoslavia opened its foreign exchange market, allowing commercial banks to freely buy and sell foreign exchange without restrictions. By May of this year, the foreign exchange market has been operating for a full year, achieving better-than-expected results. According to statistics, in this year, the total foreign exchange turnover between banks reached $2.6 billion. They have completed all foreign payments on time, and Yugoslavia's reserves of convertible foreign exchange have increased from $1.5 billion to $3.2 billion, while short-term foreign debt has decreased from $1.4 billion to $700 million.
