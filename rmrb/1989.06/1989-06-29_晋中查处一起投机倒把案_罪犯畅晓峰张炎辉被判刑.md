The Jinzhong Intermediate People's Court of Shanxi Province sentenced two criminals in a major case of collective speculation, bribery, and extortion on June 27.

The criminal Chang Xiaofeng, formerly the manager of the Jinzhong Regional Materials Exchange Center, abused his authority to purchase state-controlled goods for profit. He exploited his relationship with Zhang Yanhui, the deputy director of the Non-Ferrous Metals Department of the Shanxi Provincial Metallurgical Company, to obtain goods at planned prices and then resell them at a higher price. He sold a total of 812 tons of steel, aluminum ingots, copper, and zinc, with an illegal turnover of over 6.55 million yuan. Chang Xiaofeng's unit illegally gained 1.08 million yuan.

During the process of speculation, Chang Xiaofeng demanded 20,000 yuan in bribes in the name of his unit and gave Zhang Yanhui 12,650 yuan in bribes. The Jinzhong Intermediate People's Court sentenced Chang Xiaofeng to eight years in prison and Zhang Yanhui to ten years in prison.
