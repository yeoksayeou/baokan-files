Today, our newspaper received a telegram from Chen Liuji, a worker from Xinchang County, Zhejiang Province. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	Fang Lizhi has long been using the guise of a scholar to viciously attack the Party and the socialist system, inciting turmoil. Now he has sought refuge in the U.S. embassy. The human rights, democracy, and freedom that Fang Lizhi advocates are nothing but seeking protection from foreigners to become a traitor and a running dog. Zhu Ziqing, while seriously ill in Qinghua Garden, refused to accept American relief supplies and died of starvation, demonstrating the dignity of our nation. Students with a conscience have already clearly seen that Fang Lizhi is a scoundrel of the Chinese people and demand that the government publicly try Fang Lizhi according to law to satisfy public outrage.

　　浙江新昌一职工来电提出
    依法公审方励之
    本报北京６月１２日讯  今天，本报收到浙江省新昌县职工陈六桂的来电。电报全文如下：
    方励之长期以来以学者身份恶毒攻击党和社会主义制度，挑起动乱，现却去美国使馆避难。方鼓吹的人权、民主、自由，原来就是在外国人的庇护下，做一个卖国贼、汉奸。朱自清在清华园内身患重病，饿死不领美国的救济粮，表现了我们民族的气节。有良知的学生，已清楚地看到方励之是中国人民的败类，要求政府依法公审方励之，以平民愤。
