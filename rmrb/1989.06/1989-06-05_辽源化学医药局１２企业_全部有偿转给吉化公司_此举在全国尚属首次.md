Recently, Jilin Province has done something novel: Jilin Chemical Industry Company has purchased the 12 enterprises under the Liaoyuan City Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industry Bureau, including the Petrochemical Plant, Film Factory, Specialty Fiber Factory, and Pharmaceutical Factory, for a total of 75 million yuan. As a result, Liaoyuan City has abolished the Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industry Bureau.

According to a recent agreement, after the Liaoyuan City Chemical and Pharmaceutical Industry Bureau and its 12 enterprises are transferred to Jilin Chemical Company for a fee, the ownership and operational rights of the enterprises will be fully transferred to Jilin Chemical Company, changing their original affiliation and financial reporting channels. To ensure that Liaoyuan City does not see a reduction in fiscal revenue after the transfer of enterprises, during the period when Liaoyuan City implements a fiscal contract with the Jilin Provincial Government, Jilin Chemical Company will, based on the profit of the 12 enterprises in 1988, compensate Liaoyuan City's local finance with an annual increase of 6.5%. In addition, both parties, based on the principle of common development, will prioritize the arrangement of new projects for the transferred enterprises, including water, electricity, and steam; Jilin Chemical Company will prioritize the export of new chemical products from these enterprises.

Economists believe that this large-scale, institutional transfer for a fee is the first of its kind in the country. This move will promote the rational flow of local and enterprise assets, the rational allocation of production factors, the reduction of basic construction scale, and the solution to local financial shortages, providing new experiences. It is beneficial to enhance the overall competitiveness of enterprises and accelerate the adjustment of local industrial structures.

　　辽源化学医药局１２企业
    全部有偿转给吉化公司
    此举在全国尚属首次
    据新华社长春６月５日电  （记者陈广俊）吉林省最近出了一件新鲜事：吉林化学工业公司以７５００万元的现价，买下了吉林省辽源市化学医药工业局所属的石油化工厂、电影胶片厂、特种纤维厂、制药厂等１２家企业。辽源市因此取消了化学医药工业局编制。
    根据不久前签订的协议，辽源市化学医药工业局机关及所属的１２家企业有偿转让给吉化公司后，企业资产所有权和经营权统归吉化公司，改变原来的隶属关系，改变财政上缴渠道。为使辽源市在企业转让后不减少财政收入，在辽源市对吉林省政府实行财政包干期间，吉化公司以１９８８年１２家企业上缴利润为基数，按每年递增６．５％的幅度将利润补偿给辽源市地方财政。此外，双方本着共同发展的原则，辽源市今后将对已转让的企业优先安排上新项目所需的水、电、蒸汽等；吉化公司对这些企业新增的化工产品优先安排外销。
    经济界人士认为，这种大面积的、连同建制一起的有偿转让，在全国还是第一次。这对于促进地方、企业资产的合理流动，生产要素的合理配置，以及压缩基本建设规模，解决地方资金缺乏等问题，提供了新的经验，有利于提高企业的整体竞争能力，加快地方工业结构的调整。
