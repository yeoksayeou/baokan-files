Chinese mixed doubles players Wu Chibing and Yang Xinfang, who are participating in a major international tournament for the first time, defeated world-renowned players, the Swedes Bengtsson and Antonsson, today. However, Chinese men's singles player Zhang Qingwu lost his match.

Following Li Yingshu's withdrawal from the competition, South Korean men's doubles stars, the second-seeded players Park Jubong and Lee Sangbok, also announced their withdrawal today. When asked by reporters, the South Korean coach explained that Lee Sangbok had a twisted waist and could not compete.

The pair Wu Chibing and Yang Xinfang, who have only been together for four months, showed no mercy against their famous opponents today, winning 2-1. The scores for the three sets were 12-15, 15-8, and 15-7.

Zhang Qingwu lost to Indonesian player Susanto with scores of 15-11, 10-15, and 8-15. Chinese coach Hou Jiachang told reporters that Zhang Qingwu lost due to insufficient physical strength, and the opponent's defensive tactics were quite successful.

The men's and women's singles matches have produced the top 16. Chinese men's players Yang Yang, Xiong Guobao, Zhao Jianhua, and women's players Li Lingwei, Han Aiping, Huang Hua, Tang Jiuhong, Shang Fumei, and Shi Xiaohui are all among them. The host country has 5 men's players in the top 16.

　　世界羽球大赛争夺激烈　韩爱平被淘汰
    杨阳李玲蔚等均入前十六名
    新华社雅加达５月３１日电  （记者梁金雄、周宗欣）首次参加世界大赛的我国混双选手吴赤兵／杨新芳，今天淘汰了世界名将、瑞典的本特松／安通松。但我国男单好手张青武在比赛中失利。
    继李英淑退出比赛后，南朝鲜男双名将、本届二号种子选手朴柱奉／李相福今天又宣布弃权。在记者的追问下，南朝鲜教练解释说，李相福因腰扭伤，故不能参赛。
    组对刚４个月的吴赤兵／杨新芳，在今天的比赛中，面对名将毫不手软，以２∶１战胜了获得今年全英羽毛球公开赛混双亚军的对手，３局的比分为１２∶１５、１５∶８和１５∶７。　　在今天进行的男、女单打第三轮比赛中，种子选手张青武和马来西亚的傅国强均遭败绩。张青武是以１５∶１１、１０∶１５、８∶１５负于印度尼西亚选手苏桑托的。中国队教练侯加昌对记者说，张青武今天输在体力不足，对手采用的防守战术比较成功。
    男、女单打比赛已产生１６强。我国男选手杨阳、熊国宝、赵剑华和女选手李玲蔚、韩爱平、黄华、唐九红、尚幅梅、史晓惠均在其中。东道主有５名男选手进入１６强。
    在男双第一轮比赛中，一号种子选手李永波／田秉毅轮番大力扣杀，以２∶０轻取马来西亚对手。因发烧住院两天的田秉毅对记者说，他现在一切正常。我国的另两对男双选手陈康／陈红勇、郑昱闽／黄展中也均以２∶０战胜对手。
    快讯：世界冠军韩爱平６月１日以１∶２意外地负于荷兰的库纳，被挤出前８名。
