People have suddenly realized that the once revered, elegant, and profound social sciences and humanities (collectively referred to as "humanities") have, except for a few fashionable subjects, gradually lost their former luster. The crisis is most acute among university humanities teachers: not long ago, young people flocked to study humanities in universities, but now some majors are barely attracting any students. Books written over many years struggle to find publishers because there are few readers, and publishers cannot afford to take the loss. What worries them the most is the difficulty in finding jobs for humanities graduates.

What is the current situation facing the humanities? Where is the way out? The reporter consulted several experts and scholars and held a thematic seminar.

		The Humanities Face Severe Challenges

Reporter: Opinions vary on the situation of the humanities. Some say that "nihilism denying China's excellent traditional culture" is rampant today, while others say that despite various problems, the humanities are currently "unprecedentedly prosperous and fruitful." Some say the difficulties faced by the humanities are temporary and accidental, due to some issues not being handled well; others say the humanities falling into a predicament is inevitable because they do not adapt to the development of the times, and many useless subjects will inevitably be eliminated. This is not necessarily a bad thing; the humanities need to "face death and then revive." Various opinions are diametrically opposed but all have some rationale.

Jin Kai Cheng (Member of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Professor at Peking University's Chinese Department): The problems facing the humanities are serious; it is not an overstatement to call it a "crisis." At least, it is in a predicament, and the situation is worsening. Taking Peking University's Chinese Department as an example, the "three ancients"—classical literature, ancient Chinese language, and ancient literature—are subjects that most students are not interested in. Originally, students were interested in modern literature, but now even that is not appealing to them. They feel that studying these subjects is useless, and they all want to learn "practical and useful" knowledge.

Xiang Jing Jie (Deputy Director of Academic Affairs, Peking University): The foundational subjects of the humanities are Chinese, history, and philosophy, and these are precisely the subjects facing the most severe predicaments. Majors with the word "foreign" in them are very popular, such as foreign languages and foreign trade. Chinese, history, and philosophy are facing difficulties in recruitment. Peking University's Chinese Department has a well-known teaching force and level; in the past, recruitment was done first by the Chinese Department, and other departments picked the leftovers. However, in recent years, this has reversed, and very few first-choice applicants for the Chinese Department reach the admission score line. Last year, the literature major in Beijing recruited 4 students, and only 4 applicants reached the admission score line for the first choice, leaving no room for selection. In the first two years after the Cultural Revolution ended, many people applied for the classical literature major. At that time, people's psychology was to "stay away from politics." However, in recent years, the number of applicants has been decreasing, and last year, among those who reached the admission score line, not a single person applied for the classical literature major. Teachers are also not at ease.

Niu Xiao Han (Teacher, Philosophy Department, Renmin University of China): I teach "Original Works of Marxist Philosophy," and there should be fifty or sixty students attending the class, but each time only twenty or thirty people come, and some of them are just giving the teacher "face." Other classes are the same.

Reporter: What is the situation abroad? I heard that the humanities and social sciences are very developed in developed countries. As far as I know, in the United States, someone wrote a book based on historical materials from the Dutch East India Company about the relationship between China in the early Qing Dynasty and the Netherlands, obtained a Ph.D., and published a book.

Feng Zhi Wei (Deputy Researcher, State Language Commission): I have been to several countries and stayed abroad for three or four years. According to my understanding, humanities scholars are not very popular in any country. The current situation of the humanities in our country has already occurred in developed countries. In the Federal Republic of Germany, the most talented people go into business, work in banks, engage in industry, work with computers, or become doctors. Law and natural sciences come next. Those who study the humanities are not as successful. Of course, if you become a professor, you have a position, and people respect you, but your income will definitely not be as high as that of businesspeople. There are not many people interested in the humanities there. I have talked to many highly educated Germans, and I asked them if they knew Hegel, Kant, Fichte, and Goethe. There are still quite a few people who know Goethe and Hegel, but very few know Kant and Fichte. They asked me, "How do you know?" and were very surprised.

Of course, some social sciences in the Federal Republic of Germany are also very developed, such as economics and management, but not many people study them.

Yao Li Ming (Editor, Administrative Science Research Institute, Ministry of Personnel): In wealthy countries like the United States and Japan, there are many individuals and foundations that support humanities research, and many scholars also have their own businesses or other jobs. Therefore, humanities research is very developed.

		The Humanities Crisis Coincides with a "Cultural Boom"

Reporter: The situation is quite complex. You say the humanities are in crisis, but in recent years, there has also been a "cultural boom," and many books on humanities have been published, so saying "unprecedented prosperity" also makes sense.

Bao Zun Xin (Deputy Researcher, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences): In recent years, the humanities have indeed achieved great results, and many people are very interested. Since 1983, a "Chinese culture boom" has emerged in society. The number of students in the correspondence course on Chinese culture held by the Chinese Culture Institute has reached 13,000, and the advanced class has been held for 5 sessions. Many people pay their own money to learn. When I went to Kunming for face-to-face teaching, there were more than 400 people listening, and there were also many in Guilin.

Li Feng Ming (Deputy Researcher, Philosophy Research Institute, Chinese Academy of Social Sciences): In the past 10 years, the achievements of social sciences are not small, and many new disciplines have emerged. The research on Marxist theory has also deepened. The Chinese Academy of Social Sciences has a group of young people who are very dedicated to research and have achieved great results.

Jin Kai Cheng: The "cultural boom" also exists, and the crisis in the humanities also exists, and the crisis is the main issue. The humanities are not valued, resulting in two consequences: first, social problems are not solved by relying on social sciences and humanities, resulting in repeatedly "paying tuition fees" and not learning; second, the overall cultural quality of society is declining, and the trend of shallowness and vulgarity is on the rise, with short-sighted views becoming a problem for the entire society.

		The Root Cause of the Humanities' Predicament

Bao Zun Xin: The main reason the humanities are not popular is that they are detached from reality. Once research is conducted, it distances itself from real life. Why is there a "cultural boom"? The reason is that the content discussed and the issues researched are closely related to reality. Without being connected to real life, it cannot be "booming."

Yao Li Ming: The challenge to the humanities comes from real life itself, which is a challenge to the dogmatic system, academic style, and outdated content of the humanities. These things should have been eliminated long ago. The humanities need to develop by being able to face reality and get closer to life. In recent years, economics has been very prosperous and has developed greatly because it dares to face reality and research real problems.

Zhang Hua Ben (Director, Office of the Propaganda Department, Central Committee of the Jiusan Society): From the perspective of universities, the problems of the humanities are as follows: first, there is a lack of emphasis on training applied talents, and the main goal is to train research and dissemination talents, pursuing high levels, upgrading from specialized to undergraduate, and universities want to establish graduate schools; second, the setting of majors is mainly based on academic research, not mainly based on social needs; third, the training method is mainly based on indoctrination, not guiding students to research real problems. These are all product economy models that do not consider the demand status of the talent market. This is the biggest detachment from reality for university humanities, and it is the fundamental reason for falling into a predicament.

Xiang Jing Jie: Some humanities majors are set up too many, and actually, not that many people are needed. For example, the philosophy department has more than 30 nationwide, with an annual enrollment of seven or eight thousand students. Where are so many philosophy researchers needed? The history department and the Chinese department are even more numerous.

Yan Shao Zhi (Associate Professor, Chinese Department, Peking University): The humanities should become the intellectual foundation for national decision-making and the transformation of social and national spirits. This is the main function of the humanities. However, our humanities have not played this role but have become a policy interpreter. The state has not regarded the humanities as a valuable asset for correct decision-making and the transformation of social and national spirits. Therefore, the position of the humanities in social life is not high. Secondly, many humanities disciplines themselves lack vitality, and many disciplines still maintain the situation of a few decades or even a hundred years ago, with a strong tendency to adhere to old ways, and young people are not interested.

		Opportunities and Challenges Coexist

Yao Li Ming: Challenges always coexist with opportunities. The changes in society and people's ideas pose challenges to the humanities, but they also provide opportunities for the humanities to adjust, transform, and develop. The fundamental way out is to get closer to reality and life.

Li Feng Ming: There are too many disciplines and majors, and the team is too large. It is necessary to decisively reduce the scale, like reducing the scale of construction projects, in order to retain a small, high-quality team and concentrate efforts on a number of disciplines and majors that society needs.

Xiang Jing Jie: The setting and distribution of disciplines and majors must be adjusted. The same major is set up too many times, and students change their careers after graduation, resulting in a lot of waste. It is necessary to organize experts to evaluate the humanities majors in universities, retain a number of key majors, and maintain them as national key projects. Some disciplines and majors, although not very useful, such as Sanskrit, should also be retained. Some majors should reduce their scale. The philosophy department, for example, should only retain a few nationwide.

Yan Shao Zhi: Most should focus on applied humanities. I advocate that many undergraduate programs be changed to 2-year or 3-year specialized programs.

Jin Kai Cheng: The training of humanities talents should be categorized and stratified. Humanities talents can be divided into the following types: first, cultural creation type, which refers to talents who can be creative in the cultural field and open up new horizons and create new cultures; second, cultural replication type, which refers to the replication and dissemination of existing cultures, lacking creativity; third, high-level application type, which can use humanities knowledge to provide strategic advice for major national and social issues; fourth, general application type, which refers to the applied humanities talents that everyone talks about, such as secretaries, clerks, and public relations personnel. All four types are needed. The first and third types of talents are very important but difficult to cultivate and require high quality. The state should focus on supporting them. The fourth type of talent is in great demand. The second type of talent is mainly engaged in cultural dissemination work and does not need to be too numerous. However, the actual situation is that the second type of talent is being cultivated in large numbers, while the cultivation of the other three types of talents is weak. This situation needs to change. Currently, the humanities are facing a predicament, and it indeed provides a good opportunity for the humanities to adjust and optimize their structure.

　　文科：挑战与机会并存
    本报记者  毕全忠
    人们突然发现，威严、高雅、深奥的社会科学和人文科学（统称“文科”）除少数科目变得时髦以外，其它都在逐渐失去往日的光彩。高等学校的文科教师危机感最强烈：曾几何时，青年人报考大学文科还趋之若鹜，现在有些专业却门庭冷落了，费多少年之功写成的著作，却很难出版，因为读者少，出版社赔不起。最使他们感到危机的是文科毕业生分配工作难。
    文科面临的形势究竟如何？出路又在哪里？记者请教了一些专家、学者，并进行了专题座谈。
    　　　　文科面临严峻的挑战
    记者：对文科的处境，说法不一。有的说当今是“否定我国优秀传统文化的虚无主义”盛行，有的说尽管有种种问题，但目前文科仍是“空前繁荣，硕果累累”；有的说文科碰到的困难是暂时的、偶发性的，是一些问题没有处理好；有的则说文科陷入困境是必然的，因为不适应时代的发展，很多没有用的学科必然要淘汰，这未必是坏事，文科要“置之死地而后生”等等。各种意见大相径庭，又都有一定道理。
    金开诚（全国政协常委、北京大学中文系教授）：文科面临的问题是严重的，说“危机”也不为过，至少是陷入困境，事态的发展是越来越严重。以北大中文系为例，“三古”即古典文献、古代汉语、古代文学是多数学生都不感兴趣的。本来学生是爱听现代文学的，现在连这也不感兴趣了。他们觉得学了没有用处，都想学些“切实有用”的知识。
    向景洁（北京大学副教务长）：构成文科的基础的学科是中文、历史、哲学，而恰恰是文、史、哲困境最严重，而带“外”字的专业则很吃香，如外语、外贸等。文、史、哲招生越来越难。北大中文系教学力量、水平是众所周知的，以往招生总是先由中文系挑，别的系拣剩下的，而近几年倒过来了，第一志愿考中文系的上分数线的很少。去年文学专业在北京招４名学生，第一志愿上分数线的就只４名，没有挑选余地。“文革”结束后的头两年，报考古典文献专业的很多，当时人们的心理是“离政治远一点”。可是这几年报考的越来越少，去年上分数线的考生中，竟无一人报考古典文献专业。教师也不安心。
    牛晓涵（中国人民大学哲学系教师）：我开的课是“马克思主义哲学原著”，听课学生应该有五六十人，但每次只有二十多人来，其中有些还是出于给教师“面子”。其它一些课也是如此。
    记者：国外的情况如何？听说发达国家人文、社会科学很发达。据我所知，美国有人仅根据荷兰东印度公司的史料研究中国清初与荷兰的关系史，出了书，得了博士学位。
    冯志伟（国家语言文字委员会副研究员）：我去过好几个国家，在国外呆过三四年。据我了解，文科工作者在哪个国家都不很吃香。我国目前文科的境况，发达国家都已先后发生过。在联邦德国，最有才能的人是去办企业，到银行工作，搞工业，搞计算机，或者当医生，其次是搞法律，研究自然科学。搞文科的就不太行了。当然，你当了教授，有地位，人家也尊敬你，但收入肯定没有办企业的人高。那里对文科感兴趣的人也不多。我跟很多受过高等教育的德国人谈过，我问他们知道不知道黑格尔、康德、费希特、歌德。知道歌德、黑格尔的人还不少，但康德、费希特，知道的人就很少了。他们还问我：“你怎么知道的？”感到很奇怪。
    当然，联邦德国有些社会科学也很发达，如经济学、管理学，但搞的人也不太多。
    姚礼明（人事部行政科学研究所编辑）：美国、日本等发达国家很富裕，资助文科研究的个人和基金会很多，不少学者也都有产业或其它职业，所以文科研究很发达。
    　　　　文科危机同时又出现“文化热”
    记者：事情比较复杂。你说文科危机，可是这几年又出现了“文化热”，人文科学出的书也很多，说“空前繁荣”也有道理。
    包遵信（中国社会科学院副研究员）：这几年文科确实有很大成绩，不少人兴趣很大。１９８３年起社会上出现了“中国文化热”。中国文化书院举办的中国文化研究函授班的学员已达１．３万人，高级班办了５期，不少人自己掏钱来学。我到昆明面授，听的人就有４００多人，桂林也不少。
    李凤鸣（中国社会科学院哲学研究所副研究员）：这１０年来社会科学成绩是不小，出现了不少新学科。马克思主义理论研究也深入多了。社科院有一批年轻人，刻苦研究的劲头很大，也很有成绩。
    金开诚：“文化热”也存在，文科危机也存在，而且危机是主要的。文科不受重视，造成了两个后果：一是解决社会问题不重视运用社会科学、人文科学，结果是老“交学费”，老学不会；二是全社会文化素质下降，浅薄、庸俗之风日盛，目光短浅，成了全社会的一个问题。
    　　　　文科面临困境的根源何在
    包遵信：文科不受欢迎最主要的原因是脱离实际。一搞研究，就跟现实生活拉开距离。为什么有“文化热”？原因就在于讲的内容、研究的问题是与现实紧密结合的，离开了现实生活，是“热”不起来的。
    姚礼明：对文科的挑战来自现实生活本身，是对文科中教条主义的体系、学风和旧的内容的冲击，这些东西早就该淘汰了。文科要发展，就要能面对现实，跟生活接近一些。这几年经济学就很繁荣，有很大的发展，原因就是它敢于面向现实，敢于研究现实问题。
    张化本（九三学社中央宣传部办公室主任）：文科的问题从高等学校的情况看，有以下几方面：一，不重视应用人才的培养，而是以培养研究和传播人才为主要目标，追求高层次，专科升本科，大学又要办研究生院；二，专业设置以学科研究为主，不是根据社会需求为主；三，培养方式以灌输为主，不引导学生去研究实际问题。这些都是产品经济的模式，不管人才市场的需求状况。这是大学文科最大的脱离实际，是陷入困境的根本原因。
    向景洁：有些文科专业设置太多，实际上不需要那么多人。如哲学系，全国就有３０多个，在校生常年在七八千人。哪儿需要这么多研究哲学的人？历史系、中文系更多。
    严绍?（北京大学中文系副教授）：文科应当成为国家决策的智力和改造社会、民族精神的智力，这是文科的主要作用。但是我们的文科没有起这样的作用，而是在作政策的图解。国家也没有把文科作为正确决策和改造社会民族精神所依靠的宝贵财富。所以文科在社会生活中地位不高。其次，文科不少学科本身缺乏生命力，很多学科还保持着几十年、上百年前的状况，因循守旧的力量很强，青年人不感兴趣。
    　　　　机会与挑战并存
    姚礼明：挑战总是与机会并存的。社会的变革和人们观念的改变向文科提出了挑战，同时也为文科的调整、变革和发展提供了选择的机会。根本的出路是接近现实、接近生活。
    李凤鸣：学科专业设点太多，队伍太大，要下决心像压缩基建规模那样压缩，才能保留一支精干的、高质量的队伍，集中力量办好一批社会需要的学科专业。
    向景洁：学科专业设置、分布一定要调整。同样的专业设置过多，学生毕业就改行，浪费很大。要对高校各文科专业组织专家评估，保留一批重点专业，国家重点维持。有些学科、专业尽管用处不大，如梵语，也要保留。有些专业要缩小规模。哲学系，全国只要保留几个就行了。
    严绍?：多数要搞应用文科，我主张很多大学本科改成２年或３年制专科。
    金开诚：文科人才的培养要分类型、分层次。文科人才可分为以下几种类型：一，文化创造型，顾名思义是能够在文化领域中有创造性的人才，能开拓新天地、创造新文化；二，文化复制型，就是复制、传播原有的文化，缺乏创造性；三，高级应用型，能应用文科知识为国家、社会重大课题决策起参谋作用；四，一般应用型，就是大家所说的应用文科人才，如秘书、文书、公共关系人员等。这四种都需要。第一、三种人才非常重要，但难以培养，要求高质量，国家应当着重扶持。第四种人才是大量需要的。第二种人才主要是作文化传播工作，数量不必很多。可是实际的情况却是第二种类型的人才在大量培养，其他三种类型人才的培养很薄弱。这种状况要改变了。现在文科面临着困境，也确实为文科的调整，使之结构优化提供了好机会。
