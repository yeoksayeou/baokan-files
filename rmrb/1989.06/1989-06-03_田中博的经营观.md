Recently, the Beijing Hotel and Jingzun jointly opened the Jingzun Restaurant.

From a small village shop, after more than fifty years of operation, Jingzun Corporation now has over 800 branches, making it the largest chain in the Japanese cuisine industry.

When answering questions from reporters, Jingzun President Tanaka Hiroshi said that Jingzun's management has always maintained two principles: creation and gratitude. Creation means strictly adhering to the basic traditions of Japanese cuisine while continuously pursuing better flavors and taking the lead in the industry. Gratitude means that in business, one must not forget the humble attitude and be grateful for the support of local people.

In China's industry, there are also many old brands that have maintained their original style for decades or even centuries. However, there are very few that have developed as rapidly as Jingzun. Jingzun has two joint-venture restaurants in Beijing. The first is the "Gonin Hyakushoku" at the Beijing Hotel, a Japanese-style restaurant featuring local flavors, which has recovered its investment in just four years. The Jingzun Restaurant is the second, with 120 seats, a registered capital of $1.5 million, three Japanese chefs, and 18 Chinese chefs. All Chinese service staff have been trained in Japan. Tanaka demands that the service ten years from now should be as meticulous as it is on the opening day.

    田中博的经营观
    江畅
    日前，首都宾馆与京樽合作的京樽店开业。
    从一个乡村小店，经过五十多年的经营，如今拥有八百多家分店的京樽株式会社，在日本料理业中规模最大。
    京樽社长田中博回答记者提问时说，京樽的经营一直保持着两个精神：一是创造，一是感谢。创造，就是严守日本风味的基本传统，并不断追求更佳的风味，在本行业中起先锋作用；感谢，就是做生意不能忘了谦虚的态度，要感谢当地人们的力量。
    中国的这个行业中，也有许多老字号，几十年以至几百年，保持着创业时的风格。然而，真正像京樽这样迅速发展的，为数很少。京樽在北京有两家合资分店，前一家是北京饭店的
  “五人百姓”，日本民间风味的餐厅，四年时间，投资已全部收回；京樽店是第二家，一百二十个座位，注册一百五十万美元，三个日本厨师，十八个中方厨师，中方的服务人员都在日本培训过。田中要求，十年以后的服务要像开业那天一样周到。
