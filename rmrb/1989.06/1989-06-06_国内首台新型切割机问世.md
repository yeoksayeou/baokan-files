China's first transistor inverter plasma arc cutting machine has recently been developed, marking another step forward in China's metal cutting technology.

The transistor inverter plasma arc cutting machine developed this time uses inverter power supply. Compared with the controllable silicon plasma cutting process and the traditional acetylene gas cutting process, it has the advantages of low power consumption, large cutting thickness, low cost, and convenient operation. It can be widely used in the manufacturing, processing, and repair of aircraft, ships, automobiles, boilers, and other mechanical industries, and has the advanced level of the 1980s.

　　国内首台新型切割机问世
    新华社哈尔滨六月六日电  （通讯员于建平）我国首台晶体管逆变等离子弧切割机最近问世，这标志着我国金属切割技术又向前迈进了一步。
    这次研制的晶体管逆变等离子弧切割机，应用逆变电源，它与可控硅等离子切割工艺和传统的乙炔气割工艺相比，具有耗电少、切割厚度大、造价低、操作方便等优点，可广泛用于飞机、船舶、汽车、锅炉等机械制造、加工和修理行业，具有八十年代先进水平。
