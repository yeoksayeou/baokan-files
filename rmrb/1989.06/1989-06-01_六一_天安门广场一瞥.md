Today, some of the tents in Tiananmen Square have hung banners reading "Wishing children a happy holiday" and "Big brothers and sisters celebrating with you." Groups of Young Pioneers and children accompanied by their parents can be seen everywhere between the tents.

In front of the tents of the Central Academy of Fine Arts and the Central Academy of Arts and Design, university students are sketching portraits of some children. A little girl happily received a balloon and other gifts from a student of Tianjin University, and the girl's father asked the student to take a photo with his child.

Around 2 PM, students in the square began to mingle with the children, taking photos and enjoying the festivities. On the south side of the flagpole, students from art schools used banners as props to perform artistic programs for the children.

A parent told the reporter that she had originally planned to take her child to Zhongshan Park and the Workers' Cultural Palace, but unfortunately, both places were not open today.

　　“六一”天安门广场一瞥
    本报北京６月１日讯  今天，天安门广场的一些帐篷上挂起“祝小朋友节日快乐”、“大哥哥大姐姐与你共欢乐”等标语。帐篷之间，三五成群的少先队员和跟着家长来的小朋友随处可见。
    中央美术学院、中央工艺美术学院的帐篷前，大学生们在一些小朋友们的衣服上留下一幅幅速写作品。一个小女孩高高兴兴接过天津大学一位学生赠送的气球和别的礼品，孩子的父亲请这位学生和他的孩子一起合影。
    下午２时左右，广场上的一些大学生纷纷与孩子们联欢并合影留念。旗杆南侧，艺术院校的学生以横幅为道具，为孩子们表演了文艺节目。
    一位家长告诉记者，她本想带孩子去中山公园和劳动人民文化宫玩的，遗憾的是这两处今天都没开放。
