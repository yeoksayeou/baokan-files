According to an official from the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau, this afternoon at around 2:00 PM, some public security personnel and armed police soldiers safely transferred a weapons and equipment vehicle that had been surrounded at Six Ministries Intersection.

The official said that early this morning, a military vehicle carrying weapons and equipment was stopped and surrounded by some people at Six Ministries Intersection in Xicheng District. A few rioters seized the military vehicle, insulted and verbally abused the People's Liberation Army soldiers, attempting to seize firearms, and placed some of the weapons and equipment on the roof of the vehicle to incite the crowd, causing more and more onlookers to gather. Officials from relevant departments in Beijing tried to persuade and explain to the onlookers, but to no avail.

The official said that to maintain the public order of the capital and prevent the military weapons and equipment from being looted, Beijing dispatched some public security personnel and armed police soldiers at around 2:00 PM. They broadcasted to the onlookers: The People's Liberation Army is protecting national interests and the people's interests, not suppressing the masses or students. Blocking military vehicles and looting military firearms is illegal and should be stopped immediately; otherwise, all consequences will be borne by the perpetrators. However, some people not only did not heed the warnings but also threw bricks and bottles at the public security personnel and armed police soldiers. When the safety of the public security personnel and armed police soldiers was threatened, they had no choice but to release tear gas. With the assistance of some students and civilians, they safely transferred the weapons and equipment vehicle.

Today, a spokesperson for the Beijing Municipal Government said that blocking the People's Liberation Army from entering the city is wrong. The few rioters who violently beat and insulted soldiers and looted weapons are committing serious illegal acts. The public security personnel and armed police released tear gas in an emergency situation where firearms and ammunition were at risk of being looted, crowd control was ineffective, and the execution of duties was being violently disrupted.

The spokesperson for the Beijing Municipal Government pointed out that this afternoon, thousands of people rushed into a construction site and looted steel bars and bricks; some people surrounded Zhongnanhai and stormed the Great Hall of the People; a few kidnapped soldiers are still missing. All signs indicate that a small number of rioters are attempting to create more serious incidents. The spokesperson hopes that all citizens of Beijing will remain calm, not believe or spread rumors, not go out to watch, and actively assist the martial law troops, armed police, and public security personnel in restoring and maintaining the normal order of the entire city.

    北京市公安局负责人介绍
    一辆被围困的武器装备车安全转移
    新华社北京6月3日电  据北京市公安局负责人介绍，今天下午2时许，部分公安干警和武警战士将被围困在六部口的一辆武器装备车安全转移。
    据这位负责人说，今天凌晨，一辆载武器装备的军车行至西城区六部口时，被一些人拦阻围困。少数暴徒抢占军车，侮辱、谩骂解放军战士，企图夺取枪支，并将车内的部分武器装备散置车顶，借以煽动群众，使围观的群众越来越多。北京市有关部门的同志向围观群众劝说解释，均无效果。
    这位负责人说，为了维护首都的治安秩序，避免部队武器装备被抢劫，北京市于下午二时许出动了部分公安干警和武警战士。他们通过广播向围观的群众宣传：人民解放军是保卫国家利益、保护人民利益的，不是镇压群众、学生的，堵截军车、抢劫军队枪支是违法的，应立即停止，否则一切后果自负。但是，一些人不但不听劝阻，反而向公安干警和武警战士投掷砖头、汽水瓶。公安干警和武警战士在安全受到威胁时，迫不得已施放了催泪弹。在一些学生和群众的协助下，把这辆武器装备车安全转移。
    今天，北京市政府发言人说，阻拦解放军进城的行为是错误的。少数暴徒肆意殴打、侮辱战士，抢劫武器，是严重违法行为。公安干警和武警施放催泪弹，是在枪械弹药可能被抢劫，疏导人群无效，执行任务受到暴力干扰的危急情况下，迫不得已采取的。
    北京市政府发言人指出，今天下午，有上千人冲进某建筑工地，抢走了钢筋和砖头；一些人围攻中南海，冲击人民大会堂；少数被绑架的战士至今下落不明。种种迹象表明，极少数暴徒正企图制造更严重的事端，希望全市人民保持冷静，不听信谣言，不传播谣言，不要上街围观，积极协助戒严部队、武警和公安干警恢复和维护全市的正常秩序。
