Wan Li Visits Troops Carrying Out Martial Law

According to information provided by relevant departments of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Standing Committee Chairman Wan Li recently visited the martial law command center and troop quarters three times to visit the People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers.

On the evening of June 3, Chairman Wan Li visited the troop quarters to see the martial law troops who had just entered the city. He encouraged them to resolutely follow the martial law order issued by the State Council, fulfill their important mission entrusted by the Party and the people, maintain national stability, and protect the lives and property of the people. He personally inquired about the living conditions of the martial law troops, and instructed relevant responsible persons of the People's Congress to do everything possible to ensure that the PLA eats well and sleeps well, so that they can successfully complete the sacred mission entrusted by the Party Central Committee and fulfill their glorious duty of defending the motherland and protecting the peaceful labor of the people as stipulated by the Constitution.

On June 4 and 7, Chairman Wan Li visited the martial law command center and troop quarters again, visiting the PLA officers and soldiers who had achieved initial victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion. He extended his warm greetings and high respect to them.

Li Xiannian and Deng Yingchao Send Greetings to Soldiers

New China News Agency, Beijing, June 14

Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) Wang Renhe, Fang Yi, Sun Xiaocun, Cheng Siyuan, and Hou Jianru, on behalf of CPPCC Chairman Li Xiannian and all the vice chairmen of the CPPCC, visited the PLA officers and soldiers of a certain unit executing martial law at the Beijing Exhibition Hall this morning. They also visited the wounded PLA officers and soldiers at the Naval Hospital who were injured while executing martial law.

Accompanying Wang Renhe and others to visit and comfort were Vice Director of the General Political Department of the PLA Zhou Wenyuan and Deputy Political Commissar of the Beijing Military Region Chen Peimin.

Wang Renhe, during his visit to the martial law troops, expressed his high respect and heartfelt thanks to the PLA officers and soldiers, the People's Armed Police, and public security officers for their great contributions in the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital. He expressed deep condolences to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the struggle and extended his warm greetings to the wounded officers and soldiers.

He pointed out that the comrades who sacrificed their lives in this suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital died for the people, and their deaths are heavier than Mount Tai. The comrades' merits in defending the Party and the socialist motherland will be forever recorded in the annals of the People's Republic of China, and the people will forever remember you.

Wang Renhe said that this counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in the capital is a bad thing, but as long as we are good at summarizing experience and learning lessons, raising awareness and improving work, our socialist construction cause will certainly achieve more and greater victories.

He pointed out that the rebellion event made many people who were deceived and misled see the truth, making them understand that domestic and foreign reactionary forces always attempt to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party in our country, change the socialist system, and implement the capitalist system, turning our country into a vassal state of international capital. They use every means to exploit our temporary difficulties and mistakes, create incidents, confuse public opinion, and disrupt people's minds, until they stir up turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion. This serious fact must not be forgotten. We must be prepared at all times in the process of adhering to the four cardinal principles, carrying out reform and opening up, and building a socialist power, to engage in a long-term and unremitting struggle against this hostile force. Although we do have some corruption and mistakes in our work, we openly point this out and will resolutely overcome it. We firmly believe that under the supervision and help of the people, these shortcomings can be overcome, which has been repeatedly proven by the history of our Party.

Wang Renhe said, under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, our 11 billion people are united like a giant, striding forward bravely. No force can stop us. The slander and defamation from both domestic and foreign sources will not harm us in the slightest. After a few more decades of effort, China will definitely stand on the world stage as a powerful socialist country.

Deng Yingchao Sends Greetings to Soldiers

New China News Agency, Beijing, June 14

Comrade Deng Yingchao sent representatives on May 26 and June 11 to visit the PLA unit executing martial law in the Zhongnanhai area.

Respected and loved by all officers and soldiers of the PLA, Comrade Deng has always been very concerned about the growth of the People's Liberation Army. Since the martial law troops entered some areas of Beijing to execute martial law, she has been very concerned. Due to her advanced age, she could not visit the troops in person, and sent her staff to deliver part of her savings to the martial law troops, expressing her good wishes, and conveyed her greetings to the officers and soldiers of the martial law troops. Comrade Deng asked her staff to convey to the leaders of this unit that you have bravely suppressed the counter-revolutionary rebellion in this execution of martial law, and have made great contributions to defending the Party Central Committee and the people of the capital. As an old Communist Party member, I am very grateful to you. I also extend my warm greetings to all the officers and soldiers of the PLA, the People's Armed Police, and the public security officers executing martial law. I wish the injured comrades a speedy recovery, and express my deep condolences to the martyrs and deep sympathy and comfort to their families.

Beijing Municipal Leaders Visit Wounded Soldiers

New China News Agency, Beijing, June 14

Today, Li Ximing, Secretary of the Beijing Municipal Committee, and Mayor Chen Xitong led the main leaders of the Beijing Municipal Committee and Municipal Government to visit the Beijing Military Region General Hospital and the PLA 305 Hospital to visit and comfort the wounded officers and soldiers of the martial law troops recuperating there.

Li Ximing told the wounded soldiers, "You were honorably wounded in the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital. The people of the capital will never forget you." Chen Xitong praised the wounded soldiers as heroes of the people and carefully inquired about their injuries and current difficulties, hoping they would recuperate and recover soon.

Some wounded soldiers reflected that when they were beaten by thugs, some people in the capital risked their lives to rescue them. The medical staff of the Beijing Emergency Center thought of many good ways to protect the soldiers from further attacks. Some doctors and nurses even saved their meals to give to the injured soldiers.

Li Ximing and Chen Xitong expressed their thanks to the medical staff of the military hospital.

    李先念邓颖超托人看望子弟兵
    李锡铭陈希同等北京市主要领导人慰问负伤指战员
    新华社北京６月１４日电  据全国人大常委会办公厅有关部门提供的消息：全国人大常委会委员长万里最近先后三次到戒严部队指挥部和部队驻地慰问解放军官兵。
    ６月３日晚，万里委员长到部队驻地看望刚刚进城的戒严部队官兵，勉励他们坚决按照国务院的戒严令，执行好党和人民交付他们的重任，维护国家的安定，保护人民的生命财产。他亲切地询问了戒严部队官兵的食宿生活情况，当场指示人大机关的有关负责人，要全力以赴保证解放军吃好睡好，使他们能顺利完成党中央交给的神圣使命，履行宪法赋予的保卫祖国，保卫人民的和平劳动的光荣职责。
    ６月４日和７日，万里委员长又两次到戒严部队指挥部和部队驻地，看望在平息反革命暴乱中已取得初步胜利的解放军官兵，向他们致以亲切慰问和崇高敬意。
    新华社北京６月１４日电　全国政协副主席王任重、方毅、孙晓村、程思远、侯镜如受全国政协主席李先念的委托，并代表全国政协各位副主席，今天上午前往北京展览馆看望了在那里执行戒严任务的人民解放军某部官兵，并到海军医院慰问了在执行戒严任务时负伤的人民解放军官兵。
    随同王任重等一起看望、慰问的还有人民解放军总政治部副主任周文元、北京军区副政委陈培民。
    王任重在看望戒严部队时对解放军官兵和武警部队、公安干警，在平息首都反革命暴乱的斗争中，所作出的重大贡献表示崇高的敬意和衷心的感谢；向在斗争中牺牲的烈士们表示沉痛的哀悼；向在斗争中受伤的指战员表示亲切的慰问。
    他指出，在这次平息首都反革命暴乱中牺牲的同志是为人民而死的，他们的死比泰山还重。同志们保卫党、保卫社会主义祖国的功绩，将永远铭记在中华人民共和国的史册上，人民永远感谢你们。
    王任重说，这次发生在首都的反革命暴乱是一件大坏事，但是只要我们善于总结经验吸取教训，提高觉悟改进工作，我们社会主义建设事业必将取得更多更大的胜利。
    他指出，暴乱事件使许多不明真象受骗上当的人，擦亮了眼睛，使他们懂得了国内外的反动势力，总是妄图在我国推翻共产党的领导，改变社会主义制度，实行资本主义制度，把我国变为国际资本的附庸国。他们千方百计利用我们的暂时困难和失误，制造事端，混淆视听，搞乱人心，直至掀起动乱和反革命暴乱。这个严峻的事实是千万不能忘记的。我们要在坚持四项基本原则，实行改革开放，建设社会主义强国的过程中，时刻准备着，同这股敌对势力作长期不懈的斗争。尽管我们确实存在着某些腐败现象，我们在工作中也有某些失误，这是我们公开指出并要坚决克服的。我们坚决相信，在人民群众的监督和帮助之下，这些弊端都是可以克服的，这是为我们党过去的历史事实一再证明过的。
    王任重说，我们１１亿人民在中国共产党领导下，团结得像一个巨人，昂首阔步，勇往直前，什么力量也不能阻挡我们。国内外的一切造谣污蔑无损我们一根毫毛。再经过几十年的努力，中国一定会以一个强大的社会主义国家的雄姿出现在世界历史舞台上。
    新华社北京６月１４日电　邓颖超同志于５月２６日和６月１１日，两次派人代表她亲切慰问在中南海地区执行戒严任务的解放军某部。
    深受全军指战员尊敬和爱戴的邓大姐，历来十分关心人民解放军的成长。戒严部队进入北京部分地区执行戒严任务以来，她一直非常惦念。她由于年事已高，不能亲自看望部队，两次派身边工作人员把自己节余的部分工资转送给戒严部队，表示她的一点心意，并转达她对戒严部队指战员的问候。邓大姐让工作人员转告这个部队的领导同志说，你们这次执行戒严任务，勇敢地平息了反革命暴乱，为保卫党中央，保卫首都人民，立了大功。我作为一名老共产党员非常感谢你们，借此也向执行戒严任务的全体解放军同志、武警和公安干警同志们表示亲切的问候。祝受伤的同志早日恢复健康，对牺牲的烈士表示深切的哀悼，并向他们的家属表示深切的同情和慰问。
    新华社北京６月１４日电　北京市委书记李锡铭、市长陈希同今天带领北京市委市政府主要领导来到北京军区总医院和解放军３０５医院，慰问和看望在这里养伤的戒严部队官兵。
    李锡铭对伤员们说，你们在平息首都反革命暴乱中光荣负伤，首都人民永远不会忘记。陈希同称赞伤员是人民的功臣。并仔细了解了伤员的病情，询问了伤员们目前有什么困难，希望伤员安心养伤争取早日康复。
    一些伤员反映，在他们遭受暴徒殴打的时候，首都一些人冒着巨大危险，将他们抢救出来，北京急救中心的医务人员为了掩护官兵不再受到围攻想了很多好办法。有的大夫和护士还把自己的饭菜节约下来给受伤的解放军吃。
    李锡铭、陈希同对部队医院的医护人员表示感谢。
