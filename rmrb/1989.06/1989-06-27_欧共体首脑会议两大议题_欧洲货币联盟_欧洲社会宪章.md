Xinhua News Agency, Madrid, June 26th.

The 41st European Community Summit opened in Madrid, Spain, on June 26th. During this two-day meeting, the heads of government from the 12 EC countries will focus on discussing the European Monetary Union and the European Social Charter, the two major issues.

The European Monetary Union is a long-term goal proposed by the EC to achieve European integration. In April of this year, a group of experts led by Commission President Jacques Delors proposed three steps to achieve this goal: first, all member states' currencies will join the European Monetary System by July 1, 1990; second, establish a European Central Bank system; third, issue a unified currency.

The expert group also suggested amending relevant treaties or drafting new agreements to effectively urge member states to move towards this goal.

Currently, the report on the relevant issues proposed by the expert group has been recognized by the Commission and has won the support of the majority of member states. Only the British government has expressed opposition on the grounds of protecting economic and monetary sovereignty. The British delegation, upon arriving here yesterday, immediately stated: It is not yet time to discuss the issue of monetary union, and the delegation also requested that the EC implement fewer mandatory regulations and more economic freedom.

The adoption of a European Social Charter is of great importance to the EC's coordination of member states' social legislation and is an indispensable condition for the establishment of a European Single Market by 1992. Regarding the basic rights of workers proposed in the charter, most member states have initially formed a consensus, but Britain holds a negative attitude towards workers' participation in enterprise management.

Last week, Delors spoke on the issue of the Social Charter, pointing out that the EC's efforts in social issues are mainly aimed at promoting employment and strengthening solidarity. He hopes that member states can bridge their differences at this summit and jointly promote the early adoption of the Social Charter.

The British government's tough stance on these two major issues has recently been criticized by various member states, but since there is no sign of Britain making any concessions, this summit is bound to have a heated debate.

　　欧共体首脑会议两大议题    
    欧洲货币联盟　　欧洲社会宪章

    第４１届欧共体首脑会议２６日在西班牙首都马德里开幕。在这次为时两天的会议上，欧共体１２国的政府首脑们将重点讨论欧洲货币联盟和欧洲社会宪章两大问题。
    欧洲货币联盟是欧共体为实现欧洲一体化所提出的长远目标。今年４月，由委员会主席雅克·德洛尔亲自领导的一个专家小组，为实现这一目标设想了三个步骤：第一，全体成员国货币在１９９０年７月１日之前加入欧洲货币体系；第二，建立欧洲中央银行体系；第三，发行统一货币。
    专家小组还建议修改有关条约，或制定新的协议，以便能有效地督促各成员国朝着这一目标前进。
    目前，专家小组提出的有关报告已得到委员会的认可，并赢得绝大部分成员国的赞同。只有英国政府以保护经济和货币主权为由表示反对。英国代表团昨天抵达此地后立即表示：现在讨论货币联盟问题还不是时候，代表团还要求欧共体少搞些强制性规定，多搞些经济自由。
    通过一部欧洲社会宪章对于欧共体协调成员国有关社会立法有重要作用，也是在１９９２年建立欧洲统一大市场的一个不可缺少的条件。围绕宪章所提出的劳动者基本权利问题，大部分成员国已初步形成一致立场，但英国对工人参与企业管理持否定态度。
    上星期，德洛尔曾就社会宪章问题发表讲话，指出欧共体在社会问题上的努力主要着眼于促进就业和加强团结。他希望成员国能在这次首脑会议上弥合分歧，共同促成社会宪章的尽早通过。
    英国政府在这两大问题所持强硬立场近日来已受到各成员国的批评，但由于英国没有任何让步的迹象，这次首脑会议难免将有一场激烈的争论。
