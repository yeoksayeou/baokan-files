The Heilongjiang and Ussuri Rivers, located in the subarctic and temperate zones, are now thawing.

**Warm Currents: The Highly Active Sino-Soviet Border Trade**

In 1982, the governments of China and the Soviet Union approved a memorandum to resume border trade. Since then, Heilongjiang's trade with the Soviet Union has increased year by year. In 1987, the total contract value for the year reached 53 million Swiss francs, nearly matching the total of the ten years from 1957 to 1967.

In 1988, Heilongjiang's border trade saw even more rapid growth and unprecedented activity.

The trade of a few items with small amounts has developed into a variety of items and large quantities. Heilongjiang's border trade with the Soviet Union has expanded from a dozen items to over 3,000 items. Mechanical and electronic products have also been exported to the Soviet Union for the first time.

The monopoly of a single level and single entity has been broken, developing into multiple levels and channels. Previously, Heilongjiang's border trade with the Soviet Union was handled solely by the provincial foreign trade company. Now, there are four levels—national, provincial, municipal, and border towns—with over 180 entities engaged in border trade with the Soviet Union. Several towns along the Sino-Soviet border have been opened as transit ports.

The simple barter trade has been broken, developing towards a combination of trade and economic and technical cooperation. According to incomplete statistics, in 1988, over 160 economic and technical cooperation projects were signed. Sino-Soviet economic and technical cooperation, in addition to large-scale forest logging, vegetable planting, and construction labor projects, has also seen successes in photography, color enlargement, catering, food processing, tourism, publishing, and ship repair. Comprehensive cooperation has begun.

The boundaries of trade regions with the Soviet Union and within the province have been broken, expanding trade partners and broadening domestic cooperation. Heilongjiang's border trade partners are no longer limited to border regions but have established stable trade relations with Ukraine, Kiev, Minsk, Leningrad, and Moscow. Domestically, Heilongjiang actively promotes cooperation with the south. Many provinces, cities, and enterprises along the coast and inland have established offices and liaison stations in Heilongjiang's border port cities.

**Short-Term Forecast: A Brief Warmth Followed by Cold**

People see clearly that the "thaw" comes from the global trend of détente and reform. Although we have long awaited the arrival of spring, when the day finally comes, people feel somewhat unprepared.

The long-term state of tension has disappeared, but people in the border region of Heilongjiang are not yet accustomed to conducting business and cooperation on an equal footing with the other side. They are only beginning to face the new subject of international economic trade.

Our personnel are not adequately prepared. During a month of interviews in Heilongjiang Province, from the governor to the grassroots officials in charge of border trade in border towns, everyone is anxious about the lack of trade and economic talents. Managers, organizational cadres, negotiators, translators, guides, scientists, engineers, technicians... all types of talents are in short supply. Heilongjiang has already been troubled by the "migration of talents southward," and now suddenly needs a large number of various talents and cadres urgently, the predicament is not difficult to imagine.

Our facilities and goods are also not adequately prepared. After all, international trade, even border trade, is influenced by the level of domestic production. Heilongjiang Province's border trade contract amount for last year had a significant gap with the actual completion amount. Suifenhe, the only railway port to the Soviet Union in Heilongjiang Province, has hundreds of train cars pressed in the station yard every day. There are also train cars pressed in Suibei, Mudanjiang, Linkou, and even Harbin. Hundreds of train cars of Soviet fertilizers cannot be unloaded in time, causing the Soviet escorts to be very anxious, hoping that the Chinese railway department can help. Everyone will be moved and anxious by this situation, but it seems that no one can do anything about it. The lack of goods preparation was not prominent when the exchange quantity was small and the exchange variety was limited. But now, Heilongjiang is finding it increasingly difficult to fully meet the variety of goods required by the Soviet side. Indeed, it cannot always be potatoes plus hot water bottles plus towels plus small tape recorders. Our management system is also not adapted to the new situation. This is also an obstacle to the development of border trade. The current border trade situation tells us that this aspect of work urgently needs to be rectified and improved.

**Prospects: The Spring Light Will Be Even Brighter**

The normalization of Sino-Soviet relations has made the prospects for Sino-Soviet trade even broader.

The Heilongjiang Provincial Government, after summarizing the experiences, problems, and lessons of border trade work in 1988, has deployed this year's work. The following aspects are emphasized as key points:

- Expand the scope of economic cooperation with the Soviet Union, focusing on the development of engineering contracting and labor cooperation.
- Expand the sources of goods and accelerate the construction of bases. On the one hand, it is domestic horizontal cooperation, contributing to the expansion of the trade sector for domestic, especially southern and coastal economically developed regions; on the other hand, it is to develop Heilongjiang Province's economy with exports as the main focus and a combination of internal and external development, thereby increasing the self-sufficiency rate and improving the province's economic capacity.
- Expand the transit capacity and improve the contract performance rate. This requires the joint efforts of the national, local, and grassroots levels.
- Strengthen macro-control and improve the quality of border trade and economic and technical cooperation personnel.
- Do a good job in the trial work of the border trade and economic cooperation experimental zone. This is a job without prior experience. This will be a new challenge and a new opportunity for the entrepreneurs of Heilongjiang Province.

In Heilongjiang, we interviewed nearly a hundred provincial leaders, scholars, practitioners, and media personnel. Although their views are not entirely the same, there is one point on which they agree: despite the possibility of encountering cold snaps after the river opens, spring is still spring.

　　解冻黑龙江
    ——黑龙江省中苏边境贸易综述
    本报记者  王黑均  黑龙江日报记者  杨再立
    地处寒带温带的黑龙江、乌苏里江，现在解冻了。
    　　　　暖流：空前活跃的中苏边境贸易
    １９８２年，中苏两国政府批准换文，恢复了边境贸易。此后，黑龙江对苏边贸逐年递增。１９８７年全年签订合同总额达５３００万瑞士法郎，已接近１９５７—１９６７年十年的总和。
    １９８８年，黑龙江省边境贸易更是突飞猛进，空前活跃。
    少品种小金额交易，向多品种、大宗交易发展。黑龙江省对苏边境贸易进出口商品从十几种增加到３０００多种。机械、电子类产品也首次对苏出口。
    单一层次独家经营局面被突破，向多层次、多渠道发展。黑龙江省对苏边贸原来只有省对外贸易公司一家。现在“国贸”、“省贸”、“市贸”、边境城镇四个层次、１８０多家单位经营对苏边贸业务。沿中苏边境十几个城镇陆续开辟为过货口岸。
    单纯易货贸易形式被突破，向经贸结合、经济技术合作方向发展。据不完全统计，１９８８年签定的中苏经济技术劳务等各类合作项目已超过１６０项。中苏经济技术合作除大宗的森林采伐、蔬菜种植、建筑等劳务性项目，照相、彩扩、餐饮、副食加工、旅游、出版、船舶装修等都有成功之举，全面的合作已经开始。
    对苏贸易地区及国内本省的界限被突破，对苏贸易伙伴增加，扩大到国内广泛联合行动。黑龙江省对苏边贸伙伴已不限于边境地区，与乌克兰、基辅、明斯克、列宁格勒、莫斯科都建立了稳定的贸易关系。在国内，黑龙江省大力提倡南联。现已有沿海、内地许多省、市、企业在黑龙江边境口岸城市建立办事处、联络站。
    　　　　短期预报：乍暖还寒
    人们看得很清楚：“解冻”的暖流来自世界缓和和改革的大趋势。虽然，我们很长时间就盼望春天来临，但这一天真的来了时，人们又感到有些突然，感到准备太不充分。
    长期的紧张状态消失了，但地处边境的黑龙江人还不习惯这样平等地与对方做买卖搞合作，他们只是开始正视国际经济贸易这门新学问。
    我们的人员准备不充分。在黑龙江省一个月采访，从省长到边境城镇的主管边境贸易的基层负责同志，都为缺乏经贸人才而焦急。管理人员、组织干部、谈判人才、翻译、导游、科学家、工程师、技术员……等等，不管哪类人才都缺。黑龙江本已因“雁南飞”而困扰，现在又突然大批地迫切地需要各类人才和干部，其困窘之况不难想象。
    我们的设施和货物准备也不充分。说到底国际贸易即便是边境贸易也要受国内生产水平高低左右。黑龙江省去年的边境贸易签定合同数额与实际完成额有一个巨大的差额。绥芬河这个黑龙江省目前唯一的对苏铁路口岸，每天都有几百节车皮被压在火车站停车场。还有车皮则被压在绥北、牡丹江、林口乃至哈尔滨。数百车皮的苏联化肥因不能及时进入中国境内卸货，致使苏方押车人员十分焦急，希望中方铁路部门帮忙。谁都会为这情景感动、焦灼，但又似乎谁都无能为力。货物准备不充分在开始换货量小、换货品种少时还表现不突出。但现在苏联方面要求的品种黑龙江已经愈来愈难完全满足了。的确不能总是土豆加暖水瓶加毛巾被加小型录放机了。我们的管理体制还不适应新形势要求。这也是发展边境贸易的障碍。目前的边贸情况告诉我们，这方面工作还急需加以整顿和提高。
    　　　　展望：春光将更加明媚
    中苏两国关系正常化使中苏贸易的前景更加广阔起来。
    黑龙江省政府在总结了１９８８年边境贸易工作的经验、问题、教训同时，部署了今年的工作。以下几个方面作为重点被强调：
    ——扩大与苏联的经济合作领域，着重发展工程承包和劳务合作。
    ——扩大货源渠道，加快基地建设。一方面是国内横向合作，为国内特别是南方和沿海经济发达地区扩大贸易领域作出贡献；一方面是以外向为主、内外向结合发展黑龙江省经济，提高自给比重也就提高本身经济能力。
    ——扩大过货能力，提高合同履约率。这需要国家、地方、基层几个方面的共同努力。
    ——加强宏观控制，提高边境贸易和经济技术合作人员素质。
    ——搞好通货兴边试验区试点工作。这是项没有现成经验的工作。这将是对黑龙江省的创业者们一个新的挑战和新的机会。
    在黑龙江，我们采访了省领导人，学者、实际工作者、新闻界人士近百人。大家的看法虽不完全相同，但有一点是一致的，尽管开江后还有可能遇到寒潮，但春天毕竟是春天了。
