Pakistan's civil service system was established during the British colonial period in the 1850s. It consists of 22 grades. From grade 1 to grade 16 are ordinary employees. Grades 17 to 22 are civil servants, commonly referred to as civil officials.

To enter the government as a civil servant, one must pass an open recruitment examination conducted by the Civil Service Examination Commission. This commission is an independent body that can fully exercise its authority. The chairman is appointed by the president, and the 8 members are appointed by the prime minister, all of whom are prominent academics. They are generally not frequently replaced.

The civil service examination is usually held in October each year. The commission announces the departments, number of positions, and conditions for recruitment through the media a few months in advance. Except for the diplomatic and some technical departments, which have their own systems, other departments such as regional administration, customs, postal services, taxation, finance, police, and auditing all fall under the civil service system.

University graduates with a bachelor's degree can participate in the examination. Generally, the age range is between 21 and 25. The examination subjects are very broad, with 25 topics to choose from. Basic knowledge, current affairs, and studies on Pakistan are mandatory subjects.

Those who are selected do not immediately start working; they must undergo half a year to a year of on-the-job training in their respective departments. Additionally, the central government has established a civil service academy in Lahore to provide pre-appointment training for those who are selected. The central government also has a Rural Development Institute in Peshawar, where most people going to work in rural areas must undergo training.

For the training of mid-level officials, Pakistan has established 4 national public administration institutes, one in each provincial capital. Those who have worked in the government civil service for more than 15 years and have reached grades 18 to 19 must participate in the training at these institutes. The advanced courses are held twice a year, each lasting 16 weeks. The training subjects are numerous, focusing on administration and personnel management, economic development and planning, and financial management.

There is only one institute for training senior civil servants in the country, the Civil Service Academy in Lahore. Those who have served in the government civil service for more than 25 years and have reached grade 20 must undergo training at the Civil Service Academy before being promoted to grade 21.

The training course is held once a year, lasting 21 weeks. The curriculum includes policy development, management, economic and social development, and through field visits and discussions, enhances the ability to analyze and solve various cases.

Pakistan's civil servants enjoy high salaries and social status, with excellent benefits. The main benefits include free medical care. Young, unmarried civil servants at lower ranks are provided with free government housing. Others receive housing subsidies from the government, which are approximately 45% of their salary. Officials at grade 20 and above are provided with a servant by the government, while grade 21 and 22 officials are provided with a car and a driver. Upon retirement, if a civil servant lives in government-provided housing, they must return the housing, but they still enjoy free medical care and a retirement pension of approximately 70% to 75% of their original salary.

　　巴基斯坦的公务员制度
    朱长昺
    巴基斯坦的公务员制度早在英国统治期间的１９世纪５０年代就开始实行。它一共分为２２个级别。从１级到１６级为普通工作人员。１７级到２２级为文职官员，简称文官。
    要进入政府担任文官职务必须通过公开的招聘考试，考试由文官考试委员会主持。该委员会是一个独立于政府的机构，能充分地行使自己的权力。委员会主席由总统指定，８名成员由总理指定，都是国内有威望的学术界知名人士。一般不随便更换。
    文官考试通常每年１０月举行。考试委员会提前几个月把招聘的部门、人数、条件等通过新闻媒介公布。除外交和一些技术部门另有自己的系统外，其他如地区行政管理、海关、邮电、税收、财会、警察、审计等均属于文官系统。
    大学毕业获得学士学位的人都可以参加考试。一般年龄在２１至２５岁。考试的科目十分广泛，供选择的课题达２５种。其中基础知识、时事政治和对巴基斯坦的研究等为必选科目。
    被录取的人员并不马上参加工作，还要参加所在部门半年到１年的在职培训。另外，中央政府还在拉合尔设有公务员学院，对被录取的人员进行就任前的训练。中央政府在白沙瓦还设有农村发展学院，去农村地区工作的人大部分都须经过该学院的培训。
    对于中级官员的培训，巴基斯坦设有４所全国公共行政管理学院，分设在４个省的省会。参加政府公务员工作１５年以上，级别达到１８至１９级者都必须参加该学院的培训。高级课程培训班每年举办两期，每期为１６周。培训的科目很多，以行政和人事管理、经济发展和计划及财经管理等为主。
    培训高级文职官员的学院全国仅有１所，即设在拉合尔的文官学院。参加政府公务员制度服务２５年以上，级别达到２０级者，在晋升２１级以前，都必须经过文官学院的培训。
    培训班每年举行１期，时间为２１周。课程内容为政策发展、管理、经济和社会发展等。通过实地考察和讨论座谈，增强对各项案例的分析和解决能力。
    巴基斯坦公务员的工资和社会地位较高，各种福利待遇优厚。主要有医疗全部免费，职务较低未婚的年轻公务员由政府免费提供公寓住房。其他人员则由政府发给住房补贴，补贴约为工资的４５％。２０级以上的官员，由政府配备一名佣人，２１级和２２级官员由政府配备一部汽车和一名司机。公务员退休后如果住的是政府提供的住房，要将住房交回，但仍然享受免费医疗，退休金约为原工资的７０％至７５％。
