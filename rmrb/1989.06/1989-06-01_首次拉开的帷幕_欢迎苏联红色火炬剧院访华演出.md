We are filled with joy and warmly welcome the Soviet New Siberian Labor Red Banner Red Torch Theatre to visit and perform in China! They bring us two excellent plays, "The Red Island" and "The Noble House." It is fair to say that this is the first genuine performance by Soviet drama artists on the Chinese stage in history. Although drama workers from China and the Soviet Union have had various connections and exchanges, this is the first time that drama troupes from the two countries have visited each other. The completion of any beautiful thing for the "first time" always has a special charm, attracting attention with its pioneering significance. Therefore, our drama colleagues and audience friends feel genuinely excited and honored to jointly open this "first performance" curtain that has never been opened on the stage.

Chinese drama colleagues and drama enthusiasts are not unfamiliar with Soviet drama art. They hold great respect for Gogol, Ostrovsky, Chekhov, Gorky, and masters like Stanislavsky, Meyerhold, and Vakhtangov. They also highly evaluate the achievements of their Soviet modern drama colleagues in the arts. The visiting Red Torch Theatre is one of the oldest theaters in the Soviet Union, established in Odessa in 1920. The theater now has a group of artists with outstanding artistic achievements, including People's Artists of the Soviet Union, People's Artists of the Russian Federation, Meritorious Artists, and winners of state awards. Over nearly seventy years since its establishment, the theater has performed more than 300 plays, with a long tradition and rich performing experience. Last year, as part of the cultural exchange project between the two countries, my play "A Visit from a Deceased to the Living" was directed by Chinese director Zhang Qihong at the theater and received a warm welcome from Soviet audiences.

"The Red Island" being performed in China this time is a satirical play with allegorical elements. A theater is rehearsing a play about the life of indigenous people on an island, but it is banned by higher officials. Art and power come into sharp conflict. This absurd play cleverly and fiercely criticizes and mocks the ignorant and dogmatic "revolutionary" propaganda of bureaucrats. The author of the play, Mikhail Bulgakov (1891-1940), is renowned as a genius writer in the Soviet Union. In the 1920s, he was unjustly criticized and expelled from the literary circle as a dissident. He has since been rehabilitated and restored his reputation. His play "The Dog's Heart," which caused a sensation in the Soviet drama world, premiered in Shanghai earlier this year.

"The Noble House" is adapted from the novel of the same name by the famous Russian writer Ivan Turgenev. The play focuses on the poetic and sentimental love experiences of the male and female protagonists, Lavretsky and Lisa. The play uses the technique of free time and space transformation, weaving together the past and present of the protagonists, and flashing various characters who have influenced their fate. The director of the play, Leznikovich, is a People's Artist of the Russian Federation and was the chief director of the theater. His direction of this classic work is unique and profound, brilliantly handling this classic masterpiece. He not only designed a modern "author" to appear on stage to link and comment on the plot but also set the stage design as a decayed noble courtyard filled with withered vines, fallen leaves, and spider webs. The characters in the play seem to move in a historical relic filled with dust and decay, giving modern audiences a sense of shock and reflection, rather than being immersed in a faint sadness. This makes modern people deeply reflect on and savor the profound implications of the sentimental story of the noble house that has long since passed. This reflects the director's modern perspective on history and classic works, showing a strong modern consciousness, which is worth our good reference.

Following the Red Torch Theatre's visit to China, the Central Experimental Theatre will visit New Siberian and Moscow in September for a return performance. The realization of this people-to-people exchange activity between the two countries is inseparable from the strong support of the foreign affairs and cultural authorities of the two countries. It is particularly worth mentioning that the enlightened people of the Chongqing Wuzhou Industrial Company have sponsored international people-to-people cultural exchanges, which is also a new thing of pioneering significance brought about by the reform and opening up.

Finally, congratulations to the Soviet artists on their successful performance in China.

### 首次拉开的帷幕——欢迎苏联红色火炬剧院访华演出

　　首次拉开的帷幕
    ——欢迎苏联红色火炬剧院访华演出
    中央实验话剧院院长  刘树纲
    我们怀着喜悦的心情，热烈欢迎苏联新西伯利亚劳动红旗勋章红色火炬剧院来华访问演出！他们把《火红的孤岛》和《贵族之家》两个精采的话剧奉献给中国观众。应该说，这是历史上苏联话剧艺术家在中国舞台上名副其实的首场演出。因为中苏两国戏剧工作者虽然早就存在着各种联系与交流，但两国话剧团体的互访演出这还是第一次。任何美好事物的“首次”的完成，总是具有特殊的魅力，以它的开拓意义而引人关注。因此，我国戏剧同仁能与观众朋友们共同启开舞台上这未曾拉开过的“首演”帷幕，而感到由衷的激动与荣幸。
    中国的戏剧同行和戏剧爱好者，对苏联的戏剧艺术并不陌生，对果戈理、奥斯特洛夫斯基、契诃夫、高尔基，以及斯坦尼斯拉夫斯基、梅耶荷德、瓦戈坦赫夫等许多大师，怀着十分崇敬的感情，对苏联现代话剧界同志们在艺术上取得的成就也给予高度评价。这次来访的红色火炬剧院是苏联最老的剧院之一，一九二○年创建于敖德萨。现在剧院拥有一批在艺术上卓有成就的表演艺术家，他们当中有苏联人民演员、俄罗斯联邦人民演员、功勋演员及国家奖金奖得者。建院近七十年间，演出过三百多个剧目，有着悠久传统和丰富的演剧经验。去年，作为两国间的文化交流项目，由我国导演张奇虹在该院执导了我的剧作《一个死者对生者的访问》，演出受到苏联观众热烈欢迎。
    这次来中国演出的《火红的孤岛》是一出带有寓言性的讽刺剧。某剧院在排练一个描述在孤岛上的土著民族生活故事的剧目，遭到上级官员横加干涉的禁演令。艺术与权力发生了尖锐矛盾。这出带有荒诞性的话剧，智慧而激烈地抨击和嘲笑了官僚主义者愚昧的、教条的“革命”宣传。该剧作者米哈伊尔·布尔加科夫（一八九一至一九四○）被誉为苏联的一位天才作家，二十年代曾受到不公正批判，被视为异己分子逐出文坛。现已平反恢复名誉。他轰动苏联剧坛的剧本《狗心》，今年初已在我国上海公演。
    《贵族之家》是根据俄国著名作家屠格涅夫的同名小说改编的。这个戏集中表现了男女主人公拉夫列茨基和莉莎充满诗意与感伤的爱情经历。剧中采用时空自由转换的手法，把男女主人公的过去与现在交织结合起来，闪现出影响过他们命运的各色人物。该剧编导者列兹尼科维奇是俄罗斯联邦人民演员，曾任该院总导演。他执导本剧构思奇特而深沉，天才地处理这一古典名作。他不仅设计了一个现代的“作者”出场串联并评述剧情，而且把舞台布景设计成一个布满枯藤、落叶、蛛网的荒颓的贵族庭园，剧中人仿佛活动在一个布满尘埃、败落的历史陈迹之中，使现代观众带有惊悚、思考的“间离效果”，而不沉湎于淡淡的哀愁。这就不能不使现代人，深深反思和咀嚼那早已逝去了的贵族之家所演绎出的感伤故事的深刻内涵。这体现了编导者用现代人的视角，对历史及经典著作的重新观照，表现了极强的现代意识，值得我们很好借鉴。
    继红色火炬剧院访华演出后，中央实验话剧院将于九月份对新西伯利亚和莫斯科两市进行回访演出。两国民间性质的交流活动所以能够实现，是同两国外事和文化主管部门的大力支持分不开的。特别值得提出的是中国重庆五洲实业公司的有识之士，赞助国际间民间文化交流，这也是改革开放带来的具有开拓意义的新事物。
    最后，对苏联艺术家在中国的成功演出，致以同行的祝贺。
