"My Life's Hobby—Running"
— A Profile of Portuguese Long-Distance Runner Carla Cota

Portuguese athlete Carla Cota is the 1987 World Cup Athletics women's marathon champion. After winning the gold medal in the marathon at the Seoul Olympics, she said: "This victory was even more difficult than the one a year ago in Rome during the World Cup competition. Because the Olympic marathon brought together all the top athletes in the world. I finally won the championship, and I am happy for those who care about me, for all of Portugal."

Even when she was in elementary school, Carla Cota once won first place in a race without any preparation, and from then on, she never stopped competing on the track. Later, she continuously held the Portuguese national records for the 800, 1500, 3000, 5000 meters, and marathon long-distance races. Carla Cota's family fully supported her career. Carla said: "In Portugal, few people support girls participating in athletics, and I benefited from this." Now, Carla, who is already past her prime, simply cannot live without running every day. She said: "Running is my life, my hobby. In 1979, I had a serious illness, and my body collapsed. I followed the doctor's advice and stopped running. Later, I could barely stand up again and maintained that state for a while. I thought, if I could return to the track and run, then the joy of life would also return."

After treatment and careful planning by her coach, Betto Loze, Carla finally "revived" on the track and won the marathon gold medal at the 1982 European Athletics Championships in Greece. Carla said: "This was an incredibly precious victory for me. From then on, my reputation soared. In a certain sense, I became a role model for all women in Portugal. Today, it is much easier for them to participate in athletics than it was in the past." Carla is always full of energy. Although she has already achieved great success, she has not stopped. She said: "There are many strong competitors, and outstanding athletes will always emerge."

　　“我的生活嗜好——跑”
    ——记葡萄牙长跑选手莫塔
    葡萄牙运动员莫塔是１９８７年世界杯田径赛女子马拉松冠军。她在赢得汉城奥运会马拉松赛金牌后说：“这次获胜比一年前罗马的那次世界杯比赛困难还大。因为奥运会马拉松比赛云集了当今世界的所有强手。我终于夺取了冠军，我为那些关注我的人、为整个葡萄牙感到幸福。”
    还在上小学时，有一次莫塔在没有任何准备的情况下便获得了一项赛跑的第一名，从此她就一直没有间断过在跑道上的角逐。后来，她一直保持着８００、１５００、３０００、５０００米和马拉松五项中长跑的葡萄牙全国纪录。莫塔的家庭全力支持她的事业。莫塔说：“在葡萄牙很少有人赞同女孩子搞田径，我因此而获益。”如今已过而立之年的莫塔一天不跑简直就没法活。她说：“跑是我的生活，我的嗜好。１９７９年我生了一场大病，身体垮了。我听了医生的劝告，不跑了。后来我勉强能够站了起来，又这么维持了一段时间。我想，如果我能重返田径场跑步，那么生活的乐趣也就会重新开始。”
    经过治疗和教练别特洛泽的精心安排，莫塔终于在田径场上“复活”了，并在１９８２年希腊举行的欧洲田径锦标赛上夺得马拉松金牌。莫塔说：“这对我是个无比宝贵的胜利。我从此声誉日隆。我在一定意义上成了葡萄牙全国女性的榜样。今天，她们参加田径运动比过去容易多了。”莫塔总是充满着朝气。她已经功成名就，但并没有就此止步，她在继续跑着。她说：“强手有的是，佼佼者随时都会出现。”
