Vice Premier Tian Jiyun said today that China will not reduce but will further develop economic exchanges and trade with foreign countries.

Vice Premier Tian Jiyun said this afternoon at Zhongnanhai while meeting with the chairman of the British company JET China Limited, the Earl of Ellesmere, that the Chinese government's suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion does not mean that China will change its policies, nor does it indicate that the Chinese government is unstable.

He said, on the contrary, Chairman Deng Xiaoping has already stated that the policies and lines since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, especially the policy of reform and opening up, will not change.

Tian Jiyun said that the Chinese government has noted that some foreign governments do not understand the Chinese government's suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and under the leadership of a few countries, an anti-China wave has been stirred up. Some foreign experts, technicians, and businesspeople have left China. Tian Jiyun expressed his belief that as the situation stabilizes and the environment improves, those who have left China will return.

He said that some countries' restrictions on loans to China are short-sighted and cannot be sustained, and are not in their own interests.

He said that the Chinese market has enormous potential. Whoever misses out on this market will regret it in the future. If one country does not come to China, another country will. There are business opportunities and money to be made in China.

He said that the Chinese government will do everything possible to ensure the safety of foreign experts, technicians, and businesspeople, and will continue to improve the investment environment.

He said that China's import and export trade situation this year is relatively good. Exports have maintained last year's level, and imports have increased. Foreign exchange reserves are sufficient, and the banks' payment capabilities are good. He said that after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, Chinese society will be more stable, and the investment environment will improve. In the long run, Sino-foreign trade will develop further.

The British JET Group has had 25 years of business relations with China. In the past 10 years, the business volume between the two sides has reached 2 billion US dollars, with imports and exports basically balanced.

Earl of Ellesmere said that he came to China this time to express the JET Group's confidence in trade with China, and at the same time to express understanding and sympathy for the difficulties faced by the Chinese government, and to have confidence in the Chinese government's ability to overcome difficulties.

When talking about foreign loans, the Earl of Ellesmere said that he believes not all foreign governments have withdrawn loans. If everyone sits down and thinks carefully, they will find that withdrawing loans is not beneficial to the lenders, nor to the Chinese people.

He believes that international reports on the situation in China are not necessarily accurate and comprehensive. For this reason, he came to China to understand the situation.

Vice Premier Tian Jiyun praised the Earl of Ellesmere's "far-sighted and strategic attitude" and thanked him for his actions to further develop trade with China.

　　田纪云会见英国客人时说    
    中国将进一步发展对外贸易   
    一些国家在贷款上卡中国是短视之举
    新华社北京６月２２日电  国务院副总理田纪云今天说，中国将不会缩小而会进一步发展与外国的经济交往和贸易往来。
    田纪云今天下午在中南海会见英国英之杰集团中国有限公司总裁爱灵顿子爵时说，中国政府平息反革命暴乱一事并不意味着中国会改变自己的政策，也不表明中国政府是不稳定的。
    他说，正相反，邓小平主席已经说过，十一届三中全会以来的路线和政策，尤其是改革开放的政策，是不会改变的。
    田纪云说，中国政府注意到，一些外国政府对中国政府平息反革命暴乱不理解，在少数国家带领下掀起了反华浪潮，一些外国专家、技术人员和商人离开了中国。田纪云表示，他相信，随着局势的安定和环境的改善，那些离开中国的人会回来的。
    他说，一些国家在贷款上卡中国，这是短视的，不能持久，对它们自己也不利。
    他说，中国市场有巨大的潜力。谁丢掉这个市场，将来会后悔的。中国这个市场，这个国家不来，那个国家就会来。在中国是有买卖可做，有钱可赚的。
    他说，中国政府将尽一切努力保证外国专家、技术人员和商人的安全，并继续改善投资环境。
    他说，中国今年的贸易进出口情况比较好。出口保持去年的水平，进口有所增加。外汇储备足够，银行支付能力是好的。他说，在平息反革命暴乱之后，中国社会将更加安定，投资环境将得到改善。从长远看，中外贸易将会更加发展。
    英国英之杰集团与中国有２５年的业务关系。在过去的１０年内，双方的业务额达２０亿美元，进出口基本平衡。
    爱灵顿子爵说，他这次来华，是为了表示英之杰集团对华贸易的信心，同时也对中国政府遇到的困难表示理解和同情，对中国政府克服困难抱有信心。
    在谈到外国贷款时，爱灵顿子爵说，他相信，并不是所有外国政府都把贷款撤走。如果大家坐下来好好思考一下就会发现，撤走贷款将不利于贷款者，也不利于中国人民。
    他认为，国际上对中国局势的报道不一定准确和全面。正因为这样，他才到中国来了解情况。
    田纪云副总理对爱灵顿子爵的“有远见、有战略眼光的态度”表示赞赏，对他进一步发展对华贸易的行动表示感谢。
