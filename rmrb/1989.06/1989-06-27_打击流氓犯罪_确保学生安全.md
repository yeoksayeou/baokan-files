*Reader's Letter*

Recently, our county has frequently seen incidents where a minority of hooligans and criminals intercept, sexually assault female students, and steal students' study materials, disrupting the teaching order. A female student from the junior high school of Lingchuan Chemical Fertilizer Factory was raped and killed by criminals on her way home from evening self-study; once, a gang of hooligans broke into a girls' dormitory in Lingchuan at night, but fortunately, they were discovered in time and failed to succeed; within half a month, two incidents of hooligans intercepting and harassing female students occurred at Chengguan Middle School; all the study materials of a class of students in Lingchuan Middle School, placed in the classroom drawer, were stolen by criminals in one night; during evening self-study, students' bicycles parked outside the school gate often had their tires let out.

We suggest that the local government and relevant departments take effective measures to severely crack down on the activities of hooligans and criminals, and ensure the safety of students.

　　打击流氓犯罪  确保学生安全
    近来，我县经常发生少数流氓和犯罪分子拦截、强奸女学生以及偷窃学生学习用品，扰乱教学秩序的事。我县灵川化肥厂初级中学一女生在晚自习后返家途中，被犯罪分子强奸后杀害了；一次一伙流氓在夜间闯入灵川一所中学女生宿舍，幸被人们及时发现，他们才未能得逞；县城关中学半个月内就发生两起流氓拦截调戏女学生事件；灵川中学一个班的同学放在课堂抽屉里的学习用品，在一个晚上全部被不法分子盗走；同学们在上晚自习课时，放在校门外的自行车经常被放了气。
    建议当地政府及有关部门采取有力措施，严厉打击流氓和犯罪分子的活动，确保学生安全。
