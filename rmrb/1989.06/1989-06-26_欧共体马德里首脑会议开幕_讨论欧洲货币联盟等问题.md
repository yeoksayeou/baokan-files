The Madrid Summit of the European Community Opens
    Discusses the European Monetary Union and Other Issues

    BEIJING, June 26 (Xinhua) — The Madrid Summit of the European Community opened this morning.

    The main agenda items for the meeting are to discuss the plan for achieving an economic and monetary union in Europe proposed by the "Delors Committee" in April. If consensus is reached, corresponding decisions will be made; to consult on the issue of a "social Europe," including basic social rights such as employment in the unified market; and to exchange views on international issues, particularly the debt of the Third World and Eastern Europe.

    Local media believes that the Madrid Summit, which mainly involves the internal construction of the European Community, will have a strong ideological color and is likely to be a "clash of ideas and principles." The 12 heads of state will engage in fierce debates on the issue of building what kind of Europe. The focal point is the plan for the European economic and monetary union. According to European media, except for Britain, the opinions of the other 11 countries are relatively consistent. Jacques Delors, President of the European Commission, emphasized before the meeting that the three development stages outlined in the plan are an indivisible whole and cannot be treated separately. Spanish Prime Minister and current President of the Council of the European Community, Felipe González, even hinted that if Britain insists on its position, the other 11 countries will proceed first. Therefore, whether Mrs. Thatcher will remain uncompromising at the summit or make concessions to her partners at the last moment has become the hottest topic of discussion.

    As the first country to chair the Council of the European Community, Spain naturally hopes that the Madrid Summit will achieve results.

    However, since the governments of Italy, Ireland, and the Netherlands are in crisis, the Greek Prime Minister is seriously ill, and the ruling party in Denmark suffered a setback in the European Parliament elections, it is doubtful whether this summit can make significant progress in the construction of the European Community.

### 欧共体马德里首脑会议开幕  讨论欧洲货币联盟等问题

　　欧共体马德里首脑会议开幕     
    讨论欧洲货币联盟等问题
    本报布鲁塞尔６月２６日电  记者魏崴报道：欧洲共同体马德里首脑会议于今天上午开幕。
    会议的主要议程，是讨论“德洛尔委员会”今年４月间提出的关于实现欧洲经济和货币联盟方案，如果意见一致将作出相应决定；就“社会的欧洲”，即关于统一大市场的就业等基本社会权利等问题进行磋商；就国际问题，特别是第三世界的债务、东欧等问题交换意见。
    此间舆论认为，主要涉及欧共体内部建设的马德里首脑会议，意识形态色彩将很强，很可能是一次“思想和原则的交锋”。１２国首脑将在建设一个什么样的欧洲问题上，展开激烈的论战。焦点是欧洲经济和货币联盟方案。据欧洲新闻界透露，除英国外，其它１１国的意见较为一致。欧共体委员会主席德洛尔于会议召开前强调，该方案规划的３个发展阶段是个统一的整体，决不可以分割开来对待之。西班牙首相、欧共体理事会现任主席冈萨雷斯甚至放出口风：万一英国坚持己见，其它１１国将先行一步。因而，撒切尔夫人在首脑会上始终是毫不妥协，还是到最后关头向她的伙伴们让步，成了目前议论的最热门话题。
    作为首次担任欧共体理事会主席国的西班牙，当然热切希望马德里首脑会能取得成果。
    但是，由于意大利、爱尔兰和荷兰３国政府正处于危机之中，希腊总理病危，丹麦执政党在欧洲议会选举中受挫，本届首脑会能否在欧共体建设上取得明显进展，实在是个疑问。
