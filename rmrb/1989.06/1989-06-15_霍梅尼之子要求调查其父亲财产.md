	Khomeini's son demands investigation into his father's assets

	Xinhua News Agency, Tehran, June 14 - The late Iranian religious leader Khomeini's son, Ahmad Khomeini, today wrote a letter to Iran's Chief Justice Adibili, requesting him to "show no mercy" in investigating his father's and his family's assets.

	According to Iran's constitution, high-ranking officials, including the president, prime minister, ministers, and their spouses and children, must submit a list of their assets to ensure that they have not gained illegal income during their tenure. Ahmad made public his father's asset list submitted to the court in 1981. In the list, Khomeini stated that the money donated by his followers should not be inherited by his heirs.

　　霍梅尼之子要求调查其父亲财产
    新华社德黑兰６月１４日电  已故伊朗宗教领袖霍梅尼之子艾哈迈德·霍梅尼今天写信给伊朗首席法官阿德比利，要求他“毫不怜悯”地调查他父亲和他家的财产。
    根据伊朗宪法，高级官员包括总统、总理、部长以及他们的妻子和儿女必须递交一份他们财产的清单，以保证他们执政时没有非法收入。艾哈迈德公布了他父亲１９８１年交给法院的财产清单。霍梅尼在这份清单上说，他的追随者捐赠的钱财，他的继承人无权继承。
