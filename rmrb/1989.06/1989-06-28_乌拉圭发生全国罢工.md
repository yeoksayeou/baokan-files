Uruguayan workers staged a 24-hour nationwide strike on June 27 to protest the government's austerity measures and demand a 30% wage increase.

The strike was jointly initiated by the Uruguayan Workers' Congress and the National Workers' Convention. It received widespread support from students and citizens. The strike paralyzed most of Uruguay's state-owned and private production sectors, with banks and newspapers also closing their doors. However, hospitals, gas, water, and electricity services were not affected by the strike.

　　乌拉圭发生全国罢工
    乌拉圭工人２７日举行２４小时全国罢工，抗议政府的紧缩政策，要求增加工资３０％。
    这次罢工是由乌拉圭劳动者工会大会和全国工人大会联合发起的。它得到了学生和市民的广泛支持。罢工使得乌拉圭大部分国营和私营生产部门陷于瘫痪，银行和报馆也都纷纷关门，但医院、煤气、水电等部门未受罢工影响。
