	Twenty-eight international academic activities will still be held in Beijing in the second half of the year.

	Beijing, June 20 (Xinhua) - Wu Ganmei, Director of the International Conference Center of the Chinese Association for Science and Technology, told reporters that so far, after consultations with relevant international organizations and experts, the center will assist the Chinese Association for Science and Technology in holding 28 international academic exchange activities, including the Asia-Pacific Wind Engineering Conference, in Beijing in the second half of the year.

	Wu Ganmei said that since June, many foreign experts have called and written to inquire whether the upcoming conferences in Beijing will be postponed or moved to a third country. The center and relevant academic societies and experts have promptly introduced the real situation in Beijing, dispelling many foreign friends' doubts. It is reported that among the more than 2,000 foreign experts and scholars who have registered to attend the international academic exchange activities to be held in Beijing in the second half of this year, only 308 have expressed that they cannot come to Beijing.
