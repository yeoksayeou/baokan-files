The longest highway tunnel in Northeast China—the Eight-Panling Tunnel—has officially opened to traffic.

The Eight-Panling Tunnel is located in the eastern mountainous region of Liaoning Province on the Xian (Benxi)–Tian (Tianshi) line. This area is known for its high mountains and treacherous roads, where car accidents involving slides and falls into deep valleys frequently occur. The completion of this 1,672-meter-long, 9-meter-wide, and 6.5-meter-high highway tunnel has reduced the time it takes for cars to cross the mountains from 40 minutes to just three or four minutes. Drivers no longer have to worry about navigating this dangerous stretch.

　　东北地区八盘岭公路隧道通车
    新华社沈阳６月１９日电  我国东北地区最长的公路隧道——八盘岭隧道日前正式通车。
    八盘岭位于辽宁东部山区的溪（本溪）田（田师傅）线上，这里山高路险，经常发生汽车滑坡、跌入深谷的灾难性事故。这条长１６７２米、宽９米、高６．５米的公路隧道开通后，汽车过岭的时间可由过去的４０分钟减少到三四分钟，汽车司机过岭再也不用提心吊胆了。
