Child Education and Wedding Gold Insurance

Q: What is child education and wedding gold insurance?

A: This is a type of life insurance with savings features. By savings features, it means that it is similar to a bank deposit. The insured person pays a certain amount of insurance premium to the insurance company periodically, and at the end, they can withdraw the principal and interest. The insurance company pays an annual interest rate of 7.5%.

It has five aspects of insurance coverage. First, if the insured person reaches the end of the insurance period, the insurance company is responsible for paying the child education and wedding gold. Second, if the insured person becomes disabled due to an accident during the insurance period, the insurance company is responsible for paying part or all of the insurance money. Third, if the insured person dies due to an accident, the insurance company is responsible for paying the full insurance money and the death surrender value. Fourth, if the insured person dies from illness during the insurance period, the insurance company is responsible for paying the death surrender value. Fifth, if the policyholder dies during the premium payment period, the remaining unpaid premiums can be waived, but the insurance company still bears the agreed insurance responsibility.

Q: If the insured person encounters an accident resulting in disability or death, how much insurance money will the insurance company pay? How much will be paid for the education and wedding gold at maturity?

A: If only the wedding gold responsibility is insured, the insurance payment for accidental injury is 2,000 yuan. If both education and wedding gold responsibilities are insured, the insurance payment for accidental injury is 3,000 yuan. The maturity payment for education and wedding gold is determined by the insured person's age at the time of insurance and the premium standard.

Q: Who can participate in this insurance? How is the insurance premium paid?

A: Anyone between the ages of 21 and 50 who is in good health can insure this for their children aged 1 to 17 or children under their care.

The amount of insurance premium paid is determined by the policyholder, but it must be at least 5 yuan. The more you pay, the more you get. It can be paid monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. For example, if a 1-year-old child is insured with a monthly premium of 5 yuan, paid until the child is 22 years old, a total of 1,260 yuan will be paid, and at the end, 2,608.69 yuan can be withdrawn.

　　子女教育、婚嫁金保险
    问：子女教育、婚嫁金保险是怎么回事？
    答：这是一种带有储蓄性质的人身保险。所谓储蓄性质，就是像银行存款一样，保户定期向保险公司交一定的保险费，到时可连本带息领回这笔钱。保险公司以年利百分之七点五付息。
    它的保险保障有五个方面。第一、被保险人在保险期满，保险公司负有给付子女教育、婚嫁金的责任；第二、如被保险人在保险有效期内，因意外伤害而致残废，保险公司负有给付部分或全部保险金的责任；第三、被保险人因意外伤害而致身故，保险公司负有给付全部保险金及死亡退保金的责任；第四、如被保险人在保险期内病故，保险公司负有给付死亡退保金的责任；第五、如投保人在交费期间身故，可以免交未到期保险费，但保险公司仍负约定的保险责任。
    问：如被保险人遇到意外伤害事故致残或身故，保险公司能给付多少保险金？满期偿付教育、婚嫁金多少？
    答：如只投保婚嫁金责任的，意外伤害保险金给付额为人民币二千元。约定投保教育、婚嫁金责任的，意外伤害保险金给付额为人民币三千元。教育、婚嫁金的满期给付额则按被保险人的投保年龄、交费标准而确定。
    问：哪些人可以参加这项保险？如何交纳保险费？
    答：凡年满二十一周岁至五十周岁的身体健康者均可为其一周岁至十七周岁的子女或有抚养关系的儿童投保这项保险。
    保险费交纳多少由投保人自行选定，但至少不得低于五元，多交多得，可按月、按季、按半年或一年缴纳。如为一周岁的孩子每月交五元保险费，交至孩子二十二周岁，累计交一千二百六十元，到时可领取二千六百零八点六九元。
