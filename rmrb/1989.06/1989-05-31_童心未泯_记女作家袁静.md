Edition: 4

The 75-year-old Yuan Jing is truly busy. In her own words:

“I always feel like my back is on fire!”

At the end of April, the newspaper reported that the pine caterpillars in the mountains of Ji County had spread to the “Eight Immortals Table” scenic spot. She became anxious and restless, immediately donated 1,000 yuan to the forest area to buy pesticides, and at the same time wrote a fairy tale about the harm caused by pine caterpillars and sent it to the newspaper. Even the little “nanny” said:

“Nowadays, people like you who are so foolish are rare.”

“No way. I can’t sleep soundly while the pine caterpillars are eating away. I know how harmful these things are!”

Yuan Jing has been to the “Eight Immortals Table” in Ji County. She cares deeply for the rare green trees and dense shade in the north. In recent years, she has been passionate about writing science popularization fairy tales, covering a wide range of topics such as sound, light, chemistry, electricity, especially environmental protection and plant protection horticulture. The reporter encountered her at the Tianjin Electroplating Factory, where she was eagerly learning about the factory’s sewage treatment, her eyes shining with joy. She had a discovery! The story “Finding a Bride for Little Cadmium” was just completed. It tells of a fragrance factory releasing cadmium, which is highly toxic, while a leather factory urgently needs cadmium for tanning, usually spending a lot of money to buy it. The two factories agreed immediately. “The Adventures of the Red Comb,” is about a little girl’s comb falling into a sewage ditch, flowing to the Tianjin Ji Zhuangzi Sewage Treatment Plant, and becoming clean again… These all sparked her inspiration.

“Why do you like writing science popularization fairy tales so much?” I asked.

“I have written over 3 million words of novels in my life. In my old age, I want to shorten my battle lines and write what I think is most important: fairy tales. There are very few children’s literature writers now. Some people who do this have switched to writing popular literature, saying goodbye to the low-paying and hard-to-publish ‘children’s literature.’ But science popularization fairy tales are particularly rare. In fact, those that give children literary enjoyment, moral education, and scientific knowledge are precisely science popularization fairy tales!”

She closely follows the growth of young children. Some middle school students “pair up” and smoke; the indecent and violent reading materials on small bookstalls; the lack of children’s programs on television and radio… all of these cause her anxiety. She, quick-tempered and quick-witted, seizes every opportunity to speak out loudly, and some issues she has even taken to Mayor Li Ruihuan. At the same time, she gathers her spirits and takes action. Last year, she went to Dalian and Qingdao, diving into museums and aquariums, working day and night, interviewing, planning, and writing furiously… She wrote 9 pieces, while sightseeing became secondary. In 8 years, she has written 1 million words of children’s literature.

She has an unfading childhood heart. Moreover, as an off-campus tutor at Yueyang Road Primary School, she is familiar with the children’s joys, sorrows, and thoughts and language. She reads her own fairy tale “The Fool Became Smart” to the children, saying that when the old man stopped others from cutting down the forest, he shouted: “You want to cut, cut me first, my little forest is still small!” The children’s bright eyes were filled with tears, and her own tears were about to fall. She tells long fairy tales like “Dingding and Dangdang,” “Jade Island” on television, and when walking on the street, children far away would call out “Grandma Yuan,” and during festivals, children would give her carefully made greeting cards…

She has an unfading childhood heart.

　　童心未泯
    ——记女作家袁静
    本报记者  肖荻
    ７５岁的袁静同志真忙。用她自己的话说：
    “我总像身子后头着了火！”
    ４月底报纸报道：蓟县山林闹松毛虫，已蔓延到“八仙桌子”风景点。她便急得心神不安，立即捐款１０００元给林区购农药，同时连夜写了一篇松毛虫为害的童话送报社。连小“保姆”都说：
    “现在像你这么傻的人，少了。”
    “不行。我睡大觉，松毛虫不睡，一吃一大片，我知道这玩艺儿的厉害！”
    袁静到过蓟县“八仙桌子”，她心疼那一片北方少有的绿树、浓荫。这几年，她醉心写科普童话，广泛涉猎声、光、化、电，特别是环境保护和植保园艺。记者在天津电镀厂碰到她，她正津津有味地了解这个厂的污水处理，眼睛里闪耀着喜悦的光。有所发现！《给小镉找婆家》才完篇。说的是香料厂排放镉，毒性极大，而皮革厂鞣皮子急需镉，一向花大钱卖，两厂一拍即合。《红梳子的奇遇》，是写小姑娘的梳子掉到污水沟，流到天津纪庄子污水处理厂，又变干净了……这些，都触发了她的灵感。
    “您为什么这么喜欢写科普童话？”我问。
    “我一生写小说３００多万字。到老年，我要缩短战线，写我认为最重要的东西：童话。儿童文学作家，现在少得可怜。有一些搞这行的人却转业去写通俗文学，告别了稿费少、难发表的‘小儿科’。而科普童话尤其没几个人写。其实，既给孩子们文学享受，又给予道德熏陶和科学知识的，恰恰是科普童话！”
    她密切关注着少年儿童的成长。中小学生中一些人“搭伴”、吸烟；小书摊那不堪入目的色情、凶杀读物；电视广播中儿童节目的短缺……无不引起她的焦虑。她，快人快语，有机会便大声疾呼，有些事一直喊到李瑞环市长那里去。同时，抖擞精神，身体力行。去年到大连、青岛，一头扎进博物馆、水族馆，一天到晚连轴转，采访、构思、奋笔疾书……一写就是９篇，游山玩水却成了其次。８年来她写儿童文学达百万字。
    她，童心未泯。加之在岳阳道小学任校外辅导员，熟知孩子们的喜怒哀乐和心思、语言，她给孩子们朗诵自己写的童话《傻子变聪明了》，说到老大爷阻止别人砍伐森林时喊：“你们要砍先砍我，我那小林还小哪！”下面一个个亮晶晶的小眼睛里充满了泪水，自己的眼泪也快掉出来了。她在电视中讲长篇童话《叮叮和当当》、《翡翠岛》，走在街上，孩子们老远就喊“袁奶奶”，逢年过节小朋友把自己精心制作的贺年片送给她……
