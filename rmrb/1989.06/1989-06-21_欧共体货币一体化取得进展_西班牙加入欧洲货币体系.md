On June 16, the ministers and central bank governors of the 12 European Community (EC) countries held a highly secretive emergency meeting in Brussels. They unanimously agreed that the Spanish currency, the peseta, would join the European Monetary System (EMS) starting June 19.

During the transition period, the peseta will fluctuate within a 6% range around the central rate.

Jacques Delors, President of the European Commission, believes this decision has three significant implications: 1) It strengthens the European Monetary System; 2) It deepens monetary and economic cooperation within the EC; 3) It is a major topic for the upcoming Madrid Summit at the end of the month. Making this decision at this time has substantial political implications. He described the Spanish government's move as "bold and wise."

He stated that Spain's entry into the EMS exchange rate mechanism is a courageous step, as the country is still adjusting its economic structure to catch up with other EC member states.

On June 19, after consultations at the EC Economic and Financial Council meeting in Luxembourg, it was announced that the peseta and the Portuguese currency, the escudo, would be included in the European Currency Unit (ECU) basket starting June 21.

Local opinion holds that these two actions mark "significant progress" in the EC's economic and monetary integration.

The timing for the British pound and the Greek drachma to join the EMS has not been decided. Particularly, the absence of the powerful pound makes it difficult for the EMS to fully stabilize European currencies and promote economic and trade cooperation among member states.

The purpose of establishing the EMS exchange rate mechanism is to prevent large fluctuations in the exchange rates between EC member currencies and the U.S. dollar. Currently, among the 12 EC member countries, only the United Kingdom, Greece, and Portugal have not joined this semi-fixed exchange rate system.

### 欧共体货币一体化取得进展  西班牙加入欧洲货币体系

　　欧共体货币一体化取得进展    
    西班牙加入欧洲货币体系
    本报布鲁塞尔６月２０日电  记者魏崴报道：６月１６日，欧洲共同体１２国部长及其中央银行总裁，在布鲁塞尔“紧急召开了一个高度机密的会议”之后，一致同意西班牙货币比塞塔从６月１９日开始，加入欧洲货币体系。
    在过渡期内，比塞塔围绕中心汇率的浮动幅度为６％。
    欧共体委员会主席雅克·德洛尔认为，这一决定具有三方面的意义：１、加强了欧洲货币体系；２、欧共体内部的货币和经济合作得以深化；３、即将于本月底举行的马德里首脑会议的一个主要议题是发展欧洲经济货币联盟。决定在此时作出，政治上影响重大。他称西班牙政府此举是“大胆和明智的”。
    他说，西班牙加入欧洲货币体系的汇率机制是勇敢的一步，因为这个国家仍在进行经济结构的调整以赶上共同体的其他成员国。
    １９日，在卢森堡举行的欧共体经济财政部长理事会经磋商后声明，比塞塔和葡萄牙货币埃斯库多将从今年６月２１日起，纳入欧洲货币篮子——欧洲货币单位。
    此间舆论认为，这两个举动标志了欧共体在经济货币一体化方面，取得“重大进展”。
    英镑和希腊的货币德拉克马，何时参加欧洲货币体系尚未决定。尤其是势力强大的英镑不参加进来，欧洲货币体系很难充分发挥稳定欧洲货币，发展各成员国之间的经贸合作的作用。
    建立欧洲货币体系汇率机制的目的，是要防止共同体成员国货币与美元之间的比价出现大幅度波动。目前，在欧共体１２个成员国中，未加入这种半固定汇率体系的国家只有英国、希腊和葡萄牙。
