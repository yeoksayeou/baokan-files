The National Coal Mine Corporation recently held a telephone conference, calling on all coal industry workers to stay at their posts, fulfill their duties, focus on safety production, and ensure that coal production in June reaches new heights.

In the first five months of this year, the coal production situation has been excellent. The coal mines under the jurisdiction of the corporation have achieved stable and high production every month, completing and even exceeding the daily production targets. From January to May, the planned coal production was 136.89 million tons, with an expected completion of 143.50 million tons, exceeding the plan by 6.61 million tons. This has made a new contribution to easing the nationwide coal supply tension.

The telephone conference analyzed that June, being the last month of the first half of the year, has several new characteristics: First, all units are striving to achieve the goal of completing half of the year's tasks by the halfway point, which will lead to a production peak; second, many places across the country will enter the harvest season, and many coal mine workers have families in rural areas, which will bring challenges in maintaining workforce stability and addressing workers' thoughts; third, this month, many regions will enter the rainy season, facing threats from floods, high temperatures, and other factors.

Therefore, the conference demanded: All levels of leadership must continue to strengthen their leadership over safety production. Efforts should be made to control the occurrence of major accidents, especially gas and coal dust explosions. Serious efforts must be made to carry out "three-prevention" work (flood prevention, water prevention, and gas prevention) during the rainy season. Efforts should also be made to carry out heatstroke prevention and health work to prevent the spread of infectious diseases.

　　统配煤矿总公司召开电话会
    确保煤炭生产创新水平
    本报北京６月２日讯  记者刘燮阳报道：中国统配煤矿总公司于日前召开电话会议，号召煤炭战线广大职工坚守岗位，忠于职守，集中力量抓好安全生产，确保６月份煤炭生产再创新水平。
    今年头５个月，煤炭生产形势很好，总公司所属煤矿煤炭生产月月实现稳产高产，天天完成、超额完成了日产计划。１—５月，计划生产原煤１３６８９万吨，预计完成１４３５０万吨，比计划超产６６１万吨，为缓解全国煤炭供应紧张局面作出了新贡献。
    ６月份是上半年最后一个月，电话会议分析说：这个月的新特点，一是各单位都努力争取实现时间过半，任务过半，将会出现生产高潮；二是全国许多地方要进入夏收，煤矿许多职工家在农村，将带来一个保勤问题和职工思想不稳问题；三是这个月全国各地都要进入雨季，一些地区面临洪水威胁、高温等影响。
    为此，会议要求：各级领导要一如既往地切实加强对安全生产的领导。努力控制重大事故发生，特别是瓦斯、煤尘爆炸事故发生。要认真搞好雨季“三防”（防洪、防水、防瓦斯）工作。搞好防暑降温及卫生工作，防止传染病发生。
