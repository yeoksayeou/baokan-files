At first glance, one might think he is a simple, honest farmer or a coachman. He hails from Yǎo County, Shaanxi. On the eve of liberation, he graduated from Nanjing University and later became a graduate student at the Institute of Anthropology, Zhejiang University, where he studied and worked under the guidance of Professor Xia Nai for many years. He is currently the vice president of the Shaanxi Provincial Academy of Social Sciences and the director of the Shaanxi Provincial Institute of Archaeology. In the world-renowned sites of Xi'an Banpo, the Terracotta Army of Qin Shihuang, Fufeng Famen Temple, and many other archaeological excavation sites in Shaanxi, his sweat and footprints can be found. Today, he is still engaged in the excavation and research work at the Banpo site.

The Banpo site is located on the second terrace of the right bank of the Chencun River in the eastern suburbs of Xi'an. It is a major discovery in Chinese archaeology in the 1950s. In the autumn of 1953, the Institute of Archaeology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences sent Shi Xingbang and others to investigate the Banpo site. The following year, he led a team to begin the first large-scale excavation in Chinese archaeological history.

"Archaeology is a science that demands honesty and integrity," Shi Xingbang recalled the excavation at Banpo 35 years ago, saying, "Honesty is the foundation of archaeological work. The most important quality for an archaeologist is honesty. The purpose of archaeological excavation is to reveal the remains and artifacts left by ancient people in their original form."

On the excavation site, he personally checked various records and cleaned the site himself, never overlooking a single trace of a relic or a small artifact. He meticulously sifted through every piece of ash. Excavating tombs is a very detailed job. He led by example, requiring everyone to use bamboo sheets to scrape and brushes to sweep, strictly using iron tools. Archaeological records (text, drawings, photographs) are the most basic and original data for artifact excavation. Shi Xingbang had very strict requirements for this. The person in charge of the excavation must do it personally, record it at any time, and never allow others to substitute or record it the next day. During the Banpo excavation, he alone wrote over 100,000 words of notes.

At that time, the excavation of the Banpo site adopted the large-scale grid exposure method, which was the first in China's archaeological community. Under Shi Xingbang's leadership, archaeologists braved the wind and rain, endured hardships, and after four years and five large-scale excavations and clean-ups, they opened 127 grids, excavated an area of over 10,000 square meters, discovered 46 intact houses, 250 tombs, and over 200 pits, and obtained tens of thousands of production tools and daily necessities. This attempt at large-scale grid exposure opened up new paths for archaeological excavation, which are still widely used in China today.

Shi Xingbang believes that cultural relics and archaeology are ancient and evergreen professions. Archaeologists not only need to be diligent in their work, but also need to be diligent in their observations, communications, and manual labor. The book "Xi'an Banpo," co-authored by him and more than ten colleagues, emphasizes the use of archaeological material data to reconstruct the structure of tribal society, which has made breakthroughs in the theory and methods of Chinese archaeological research. In addition to his busy leadership work and social activities, he has been working day and night, successively compiling and publishing works such as "Xi'an Banpo — Primitive Tribal Commune Settlement Site" and "Banpo Tribal Commune," as well as dozens of papers such as "Several Problems in the Archaeological Study of the Primitive Society in the Yellow River Basin." At a recent international archaeological conference held in Xi'an, experts from home and abroad unanimously praised his contributions to the archaeological cause. However, he believes that the research on the Banpo Yangshao culture has only been half completed, that is, the "car" has only reached "Banpo." The next step is to expand to the Qin, Han, and Tang dynasties based on this, and he hopes to make breakthroughs in the study of the origins of agriculture, family, private property, and the state!

### 拽“车”到“半坡”——记考古学家石兴邦

　　拽“车”到“半坡”
    ——记考古学家石兴邦
    本报记者  孟西安
    乍一见，给人的印象，分明是淳厚朴实的老农或车夫。
    他是陕西耀县人。解放前夕毕业于南京大学，后为浙江大学人类学研究所研究生，长期在夏鼐先生指导下学习和工作。现任陕西省社会科学院副院长、省考古研究所所长。在举世闻名的西安半坡、秦始皇兵马俑、扶风法门寺以及陕西的许多考古发掘现场，都留下了他的汗水和足迹。今天，他仍在进行着半坡遗址的发掘和研究工作。
    半坡遗址位于西安市东郊浐河右岸的第二阶地，是２０世纪５０年代中国考古学的重大发现。１９５３年秋，中科院考古研究所派石兴邦等人对半坡遗址进行调查。次年，他率众开始了中国考古学史上第一次大面积探方考古发掘。
    “考古学是一门科学，科学要求老老实实，来不得半点虚假”，石兴邦回忆起３５年前的半坡发掘时说，“诚实是考古工作的本钱。考古工作者最重要的品质就是诚实。考古发掘的目的就是把古人遗留下的遗迹和遗物原原本本地揭露出来。”
    在考古发掘现场，他亲自核对各种记录，亲自动手清理，从不放过一个遗迹现象，从不漏掉一件细小文物，对于灰烬也一一加以筛选。清理墓葬是十分细致的工作，他带头并要求大家必须用竹笺剔剥、毛刷清扫，严格使用铁制工具。考古发掘的记录（文字、绘图、照像）是文物发掘最基本、最原始的资料，石兴邦对此要求十分严格。发掘负责人必须亲自去做，随时去记，绝不允许他人代替，也不许隔日追记。仅在半坡发掘过程中，他自己就写了１０万多字的笔记。
    当时，半坡遗址的发掘采用大面积探方揭露法，这在我国考古界是第一次。在石兴邦的主持下，考古工作者栉风沐雨，风餐露宿，经过４年５次大规模的发掘和清理，先后开探方１２７个，发掘面积达１万多平方米，发现完整房子４６座，墓葬２５０座，窖穴２００多个，获得生产工具和生活用具万件之多。这种大面积探方揭露法的尝试，开辟了考古发掘的新途径，至今仍为我国考古发掘所普遍采用。
    石兴邦认为，文物考古是古老而苍翠的事业，考古工作者不仅要腿勤，眼勤，嘴勤，而且还要手勤。由他主笔、１０多位同志通力合作写成的《西安半坡》一书，重视利用考古实物资料来复原氏族社会的结构，这对中国考古学研究的理论和方法都有所突破。他除了从事繁忙的领导工作和社会活动之外，日夜兼程，先后编写出版了《西安半坡——原始氏族公社聚落遗址》、《半坡氏族公社》等著作及《黄河流域原始社会考古研究上的若干问题》等数十篇论文。不久前在西安举行的国际性考古学术讨论会上，来自国内外的专家们齐声称赞他对考古事业作出的贡献。但他认为，半坡仰韶文化的研究才进行了一半，就是说，“车”才到了“半坡”。下一步，得以此为基础，向秦、汉、唐拓展，并希望在农业起源和家庭、私有制、国家的起源研究上有所突破！
