	Soul
	Ma Guangfu

	The elders say that humans have souls. But I don't believe there is such a thing as a soul in this world.

	But recently, I saw one.

	The train I was on roared out of Shijiazhuang. The car was packed, with people shoulder to shoulder and back to back.

	A young man who had just boarded saw a seat with a dirty, tattered book titled "Wild Woman's Love Story" on it. He picked it up and tossed it onto the tea table, then sat down as if nothing had happened.

	A man who looked like an official sitting next to him said, "Take your assigned seat. Someone is sitting here."

	The young man glared, snorted, and his facial muscles twitched. He stared menacingly at a young girl in a red shirt sitting across from him and asked, "Is that so?"

	The little girl nodded and said, "Yes. That seat belongs to another big brother. He went to get some water."

	Just as she finished speaking, the sturdy young man who had gone to get water returned. He roared, "Get the hell out of here!"

	The seated young man didn't even look up, one hand fiddling in his pocket, clearly holding a dagger. After a moment, he rolled his eyes and said, "Don't mess with me! I have a ticket. The seat is empty, so I'm sitting here, and I'm staying put!"

	The train's roar mixed with the unseemly arguments and curses, like ice water pouring into my ears, making my skin crawl and my blood freeze. I thought to myself, if people have souls, then some people probably only have a shell.

	Four hands were tangled together, a fight seemed imminent.

	No one tried to stop them, and no one tried to pull them apart.

	Suddenly, the girl in the red shirt stood up, blinking her double-lidded, bright black eyes, and said in a voice like a silver bell, "Don't fight! I'm getting off at the next stop. One of you come and sit here."

	The four hands let go. One of the young men sat in the seat the girl had vacated. Everyone let out a sigh of relief and turned their attention to the girl. Her plump, fair, and pretty face suddenly turned red, as red as an apple. She pursed her lips, tossed her jet-black hair behind her, and picked up her small travel bag, heading towards the door.

	The train stopped at Baoding Station. I thought she must have gotten off there.

	The train's final destination was Beijing. When we arrived, I got off the train and navigated through the crowd like a river. Exiting the station, I hurried towards the bus stop.

	My God! I suddenly saw that girl: big eyes, double eyelids, a pretty face, jet-black hair, a red shirt...

	Hadn't she gotten off at Baoding Station three hours ago?

	Was I seeing a soul? I don't believe so. Had I seen wrong? Impossible! So, had she hidden in another car and stood all the way to Beijing?

	I wanted to catch up to her and sincerely say, "You are truly good, I am not as good as you." But in the end, I didn't catch up. She boarded the bus with her small travel bag, the door closed, and the bus drove away.

	I stood there for a long time, watching the bus disappear into the distance. My heart suddenly thought of what the elders said, that humans have souls.

	I believed it: people have souls, the nation has a soul, the ethnic group has a soul...

　　魂
    马光复
    听老人讲，人是有魂儿的。但我不信世界上会有什么魂儿。
    可最近我却看到了。
    我乘坐的火车呼啸着开出了石家庄市。车厢里人挨人，人挤人，满满登登。
    刚上车的一个小伙子，看到一个座位上放着本又脏又破名叫《野女艳史》的书，抄起来，扔到茶几上，旁若无人地坐下。
    邻座一位干部模样的人说：“对号入座，这儿有人。”
    那小伙子眼一瞪，鼻子一抽，脸上肌肉一抖，怪怕人地望着对面座位上的一位穿红上衣的十来岁的小姑娘，问：“是吗？”
    小姑娘点点头说：“是。那也是一位大哥哥，他好像是去打开水了。”
    话音刚落，那打水去的粗壮的小伙子已经回来了，他凶煞似地吼道：“狗杂种，滚起来！”
    坐着的小伙子连头也不抬，一只手在裤兜里摆弄着，那分明是一把匕首。一会儿，他眼睛往上一翻，说：“少犯嘎！老子有票。座空着，就要坐，坐定了！”
    火车的轰鸣声夹杂着不堪入耳的争吵与谩骂，像冰水一样灌入耳中，让人肌寒血凝，连心都凉了。我暗自想，假如人有魂儿的话，那有些人大概仅只有一个躯壳了。
    四只手揪巴在一起，一场厮打迫在眉睫。
    没有人劝，也没有人去拉。
    忽然，那个穿红色上衣的小姑娘站起身，眨眨有着双眼皮的又黑又亮的大眼睛，声儿像银铃似地说：
    “别打架啦！我要下车了。你们过来一个人坐这儿吧。”
    四只手松开了。一个小伙子坐到小姑娘让出的座位上。所有的人都松了一口气，这才把目光集中到那小姑娘身上。她那胖乎乎的白净净的好看的脸刹那间红了，红得跟苹果似的。她抿抿嘴，甩了一下脑后的油黑油黑的头发，提着一个不大的旅行袋向车门走去。
    火车在保定站停了。我想，她肯定在这一站下车了。
    这趟车终点站是北京。到站了，我下了车，在河样的人流中穿行。出了站口，我快步走向公共汽车站。
    天啊！我忽然看到了那个小姑娘：大眼睛、双眼皮儿、好看的脸、油黑的头发、红上衣……
    她不是三个小时前在保定站下车了吗？
    难道我看到了魂儿？我不信。难道是看花了眼？决不会！那么，她是躲到别的车厢，一直站到了北京？
    我想追上她，真诚地对她说一声：“你真好，我不如你。”可终于没有追上，她提着那只不大的旅行袋挤上了公共汽车，门关上，车开走了。
    我久久伫立着，目送那远去的汽车。心中又忽然想起，老人说，人是有魂儿的。
    我相信了：人有魂，国有魂，民族有魂……
