The Guangzhou Military Region's Bureau of Retired Soldiers conducted a survey of over 600 widows of retired soldiers in the region. The survey revealed that the living standards of these widows have generally declined, with over 400 of them relying on a monthly subsidy of around 60 yuan to make ends meet. The Guangzhou Military Region Party Committee believes that these women have long accompanied their husbands in military campaigns and have made significant contributions to the construction of the military. Now that they are facing difficulties, it is necessary to do everything possible to help them. The military region has decided that, following the allocation of 700,000 yuan last year, it will now allocate an additional 1,000,000 yuan in special funds to improve the living conditions of over 600 widows of retired soldiers.

In Wulian County, Shandong Province, the wives of county-level cadres, in accordance with policy regulations, have converted to urban household registration and have become "part-time workers," taking on temporary jobs. Under the influence of these county-level cadres, over 300 wives of county-level and township-level cadres in the county have also converted to urban household registration and joined the ranks of "part-time workers."

    广州军区拨专款　老干遗孀得补助
    山东五莲传佳话　县官妻子打短工
    ●广州军区老干部局对该军区600多名老干部遗孀作的调查表明，遗孀的生活水平普遍下降，有400多人每月只靠60元左右的补助费维持生活。广州军区党委认为，这些同志长期随老干部南征北战，为部队建设作出了很大贡献。现在她们的生活遇到了困难，应该尽力帮助解决。军区决定，继去年拿出7万元之后，最近又拨出10万元专款，用于改善600多名老干部遗孀的生活。　（周扬东）
    ●山东省五莲县县级干部的妻子按政策规定转为城镇户口后，成了“游击队员”，干的都是临时工。在县级干部的带动下，全县300多名县直属机关干部、乡镇干部的妻子按政策规定“农转非”后，也都加入了“游击队员”的行列。
