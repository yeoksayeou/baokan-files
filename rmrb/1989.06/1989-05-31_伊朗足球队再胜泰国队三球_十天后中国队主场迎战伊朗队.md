Iran's national football team defeated Thailand 3-0 in a match for the 1990 World Cup Asian qualifying round held in Tehran on May 30. This was the second encounter between the two teams in this qualifying round. The original match, scheduled for March 5 in Iran, was postponed due to the cancellation of the flight carrying the Thai team. The match was rescheduled with the approval of FIFA.

In yesterday's match, the Iranian team dominated the field, with the Thai team struggling to advance the ball into the Iranian half. By the end of the first half, Iran was leading 2-0. In their first encounter, Iran also won 3-0.

So far, Iran has won all four of its matches, accumulating 8 points and temporarily leading the group. China has won all three of its matches, accumulating 6 points and ranking second. Bangladesh and Thailand have each won one match and lost five, accumulating 2 points each, and are out of contention for advancing in the group. There are still three matches left in the group. China and Iran will face each other on June 11 in Shenyang and on June 21 in Tehran. China will also play Thailand on June 28.

　　伊朗足球队再胜泰国队三球
    十天后中国队主场迎战伊朗队
    新华社北京５月３１日电  据外电报道，伊朗队昨天在首都德黑兰进行的１９９０年世界杯足球赛亚洲区预赛第五组一场比赛中，以３∶０再次战胜泰国队。这场比赛是伊朗队和泰国队在这次预选赛中的第二次交锋，原定于今年３月５日在伊朗进行，因泰国队乘坐的班机取消，经国际足联同意而改期举行。
    在昨天的比赛中，场上出现了一面倒的局面，泰国队在伊朗队的强大攻势面前几乎不能把球推进到伊朗队门前。上半时比赛结束时，伊朗队以２∶０领先。伊朗队在与泰国队的首场比赛中，也以３∶０的同样比分获胜。
    至此，伊朗队４战４胜积８分暂列这个小组榜首；中国队３战３胜积６分居第二；孟加拉国队和泰国队分别为６战１胜５负和５战一胜４负同积２分，小组出线已无望。目前，这个小组还有３场比赛待进行，中国队和伊朗队先后于６月１１日（在沈阳）和２１日（在德黑兰）两度较量，中国队还将于６月２８日与泰国队交锋。
