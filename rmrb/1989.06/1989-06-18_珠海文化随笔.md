First-time visitors to Zhuhai are often captivated by its charming allure: sleek imported cars speeding along wide roads; modern buildings harmoniously stretching towards the horizon; lush greenery covering the streets, and the sea's breeze stirring the heart. In this place, you won't think of words like "dense and orderly," "bustling," or "noisy and crowded." Instead, you'll feel the freshness, comfort, and even grandeur and vastness of a southern border city. However, those who stay longer begin to delve deeper into the spiritual and cultural aspects of the society.

Family Dance Parties – The Social Culture of "Small Communities"
It is said that Zhuhai residents enjoy family dance parties. Perhaps this is due to the relatively meager cultural life in Zhuhai, while housing space is quite ample. The author had the pleasure of being invited to a family dance party. The hosts of the party were both educated individuals. Upon entering the host's home, the author was immediately drawn to the luxurious and elegant decorations. The living room, spanning over twenty square meters, was adorned with high-end imported electronics strategically placed around the room; the soft light from the ceiling lamps reflected off the intricate patterned tiles on the floor; the high-quality stereo system resonated with the evening's theme. As the author took a seat, there were already a dozen or so young people in the room. The male host introduced everyone to us, and then we exchanged business cards and shook hands in a harmonious and relaxed atmosphere. Everyone enjoyed drinks, fruits, and pastries, chatting and sharing experiences.

Dumpling Making – A Special "Emotional Culture"
Making dumplings is a traditional culinary practice in northern China, but in Zhuhai, I heard that southerners from the mainland also enjoy this activity. I remember, just a few days after arriving in Zhuhai, a fellow townsman invited me to his home for a dumpling-making session on the weekend. In my memory, this friend had never shown such interest before and was not particularly skilled at it. On the weekend, I arrived at his home on time. Around the large round table in the living room, more than ten people had already gathered. My friend and his wife were skillfully rolling out the dumpling wrappers, while others were chatting and laughing as they made dumplings. As soon as they saw me, my friend loudly announced, "This gentleman is also a fellow townsman and works at the ×× unit in Zhuhai." Immediately, the room filled with familiar accents. It was then that I realized everyone present was a fellow townsman, and a sense of familiarity and warmth welled up within me. Everyone conversed naturally and joyfully in our hometown dialect.

Making dumplings carries a strong sense of human warmth. In this collaborative process, you can not only rekindle memories that are about to fade, cherishing them, but also gain endless warmth and genuine friendship. Therefore, dumpling making plays a special role in the lives of people in the new Zhuhai Special Economic Zone, and can even be considered a part of their cultural life. A scholar once said: Culture is the entire way of life of any society, not just the more refined and spiritually uplifting parts of life that society recognizes. Zhuhai is creating a unique culture for the new Zhuhai Special Economic Zone.

　　珠海文化随笔
    君衡
    初到珠海的人，都能感受到一种迷人的风采：进口车在宽阔马路上风驰电掣；现代建筑色调和谐地铺向天边；绿色的植物覆盖街区，海的气息撩人心绪。置身于此地，你断然想不到“鳞次栉比”，“熙熙攘攘”或“繁华喧嚣”等词汇，只会感到南国边城的清新、舒坦，甚至恢宏、高远。但久居于此，人们便会细细捉摸其更深层的东西，即一种带有精神色彩的社会文化心理层面。
    家庭舞会——“小社区”的交流文化。
    据说珠海人喜欢家庭舞会。这或许是由于目前珠海文化生活较为贫乏，而住房面积却很“富裕”的缘故。笔者曾有幸被邀请参加过一个家庭舞会。舞会的男女主人皆属有文凭的知识阶层。走进主人家门，笔者便被那富丽堂皇的装修和布置所吸引。二十几平方米的客厅豪华典雅；一应俱全的进口家电错落有致地置于四周；乳黄色瓷块的拼花地板倒映着吸顶灯柔和的光；高级组合音响的共鸣声正烘托着当晚活动的主题。笔者落座时，屋子里已有十几个年轻人，男主人向我们一一作了介绍，然后，便是互递名片，握手相识。在一种和谐、轻松的气氛中，大家喝着饮料，吃着瓜果、糕点，谈天说笑，交流感受。
    包饺子——一种特殊的“亲情文化”。
    包饺子，本是我国北方人的饮食习惯，可在珠海，我听说内地来的南方人，也喜欢包饺子。记得刚到珠海不几天，笔者就接到一个同乡朋友的电话，相约周末到他家去包饺子。在笔者的印象中，这位仁兄过去是无此雅兴的，更不精于此道。周末笔者按时赴约，走进他家客厅，大圆桌旁已聚集了十多人，这位朋友和他太太正熟练地擀着饺子皮儿，其他人则在有说有笑地包着。一见到我，这位朋友立刻高声说道，这位先生也是老乡，现在珠海××单位工作。顿时，屋子里响起一片熟悉的乡音。至此，笔者方知这个晚上来包饺子的全是老乡，随即一种他乡遇故知的感情油然而生。大家都用家乡话自然愉快地交谈着。
    包饺子有着一种浓郁的人情味，在这种“协同作战”的过程中，你不但可以拾起数片即将化作春泥的记忆之花，细细珍藏，同时也可获得无限温馨和真挚的友情。故包饺子在珠海的新特区人生活中有着特殊功用，甚至可以说是他们文化生活的部分。某学者说过：文化是任何社会的全部生活方式，而不仅仅是被社会公认为更高雅、更令人心旷神怡的那部分生活方式。珠海正创造着一种属于新珠海的特区文化。
