The United States and the Soviet Union resumed strategic nuclear weapons talks today in Geneva. This is the 11th round of negotiations aimed at reducing strategic nuclear weapons between the two countries.

The strategic nuclear weapons talks are one of the three components of the U.S.-Soviet arms control negotiations, which began in 1985. Driven by their respective needs and the international community's strong demand for nuclear disarmament, after several years of bargaining, the two sides have basically reached an agreement on the general outline for reducing strategic weapons in the coming years. The main contents include: reducing their existing strategic weapon delivery systems to 1,600 units and strategic nuclear warheads to 6,000; limiting the warheads of intercontinental ballistic missiles and submarine-launched ballistic missiles to 4,900, with heavy missile warheads not exceeding 1,540; and drafting three strategic weapons verification documents based on the verification principles of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty.

Currently, the main disagreements between the two sides lie in how to determine the specific quotas for land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles, submarine-launched ballistic missiles, and strategic bombers, as well as verification measures.

This morning, the heads of the U.S. and Soviet delegations, Richard Burt and Yuri Nazarkin, held their first private meeting at the U.S. Mission to the United Nations in Geneva to discuss the specific agenda for this round of talks. The first plenary session of the two delegations is scheduled to be held on June 21.

　　美苏恢复战略核武器谈判
    据新华社日内瓦６月１９日电（记者施光耀）美苏战略核武器谈判今天在日内瓦恢复。这是两国谋求削减战略核武器的第１１轮谈判。
    战略核武器谈判是美苏军备控制谈判的三个组成部分之一，始于１９８５年。双方出于各自的需要，并迫于国际社会对核裁军的强烈要求，经过几年的讨价还价，已基本达成了今后几年削减战略武器的大体轮廓，其主要内容有：把各自现有的战略武器运载工具减少到１６００件，战略核弹头减到６０００个；将洲际导弹和潜射导弹的弹头限制在４９００个之内，其中重型导弹弹头不超过１５４０个；以中导条约的核查原则为基础，制订３个战略武器核查文件。
    目前双方的主要分歧表现在如何确定陆基洲际导弹、潜射导弹和战略轰炸机的具体分类限额以及核查措施等几个方面。
    今天上午，美、苏两国代表团团长理查得·伯特和尤里·纳扎尔金在美国驻联合国日内瓦代表团驻地进行了首次单独会晤，商定本轮谈判的具体日程。两国代表团的第一次全体会议预计将于２１日举行。
