The "La Salle" station in the northern hub of Mexico City's subway system sees tens of thousands of passengers daily. To ensure that passengers can benefit from their time spent here, the authorities and relevant departments have constructed a "tunnel from the micro to the macro world" of science. The entrance to the tunnel reads: "Science is the most important cultural, economic, and social force in modern society."

This scientific tunnel, named "The Power of Ten," utilizes the spacious corridors on both sides of the subway hall to display images and concise explanations. Starting from the entrance of the hall, people journey into the depths of the micro world. The first image is of a human hand. Then, images of the hand's skin under different magnifications are shown. Under a magnification of one-tenth, the delicate skin appears quite rough; under a magnification of one-thousandth, the skin reveals deep grooves; at ten-thousandths, the skin looks like a rugged, undulating plain seen from the sky. Starting from one-hundred-thousandths, the transparent, bubble-like structures of the subcutaneous tissue become visible; at one-millionth, one has already entered the nucleus of the cell. Thus, with just a few steps, people can take an unimaginable leap on the "staircase of the human world." It also tells people that in human understanding, a simple tenfold increase or decrease can greatly deepen one's knowledge of oneself. When the magnification reaches one-trillionth, human understanding of oneself has already penetrated from the surface to the most basic layer of matter, the "quark."

Just as people's thoughts are soaring and they are immersed in the infinite recognition of their own matter, suddenly, night falls. However, this is not the end of the scientific tunnel. Looking up, one sees the vast sky and the countless stars shining brightly. Moving forward, there is a uniquely designed exhibition hall. Inside, images and models introduce "The Evolution and Study of Insects."

Following the flow of subway passengers, we return to the other side of the scientific tunnel to explore the macro world. Similar to the micro journey, the first image is of a normally proportioned lying person. Then, with a tenfold increase, the view gradually expands. Initially, the image shows a person lying on the grass. After a tenfold increase, the grass is seen as a small green patch in the middle of crisscrossing highways. With another tenfold increase, it becomes an aerial view of a city; at seven tenfolds, the city is submerged in the vast North American continent; at eight tenfolds, one sees the Earth where they live; at ten tenfolds, the enormous Earth is merely a small dot in the universe; at fourteen tenfolds, one sees the solar system; at twenty tenfolds, the solar system is just a blurry spot of light; until one adds twenty-five zeros after one, people finally realize that all the stars in the entire universe appear to be mere particles. That is the infinite macro world.

Strolling through the scientific tunnel, mothers point out the universe to their children, and students quietly record in their notebooks. The eyes of the passengers flash with a spark of surprise, which is the spark of science and wisdom.

　　墨西哥城地下科学隧道
    本报记者  郭伟成
    墨西哥城地铁的北部枢纽“拉萨”站，每天过往旅客数十万。为了使旅客在驻步之时有所获益，当局及有关部门在这里建起了一条“从微观到宏观世界”的科学隧道。隧道的入口处写着：“科学是现代社会最重要的文化、经济与社会力量。”
    这条名为“十进位的力量”的科学隧道，是利用宽敞的地厅走道两侧，布置了图片和扼要的说明。从地厅入口开始，人们走向微观世界的深层。第一幅图片是一只人手。然后看到的是在不同倍数的显微镜下的手的皮肤形象。在十分之一的显微镜下，细腻的皮肤变得十分粗糙；在千分之一的显微镜下，皮肤显现出深深的沟壑；在万分之一时，皮肤就像从空中看到的荒原那样粗犷、起伏；从十万分之一的显微镜下开始，已经可以看到皮下组织那透明的泡状体物质；到百万分之一时，已深入到细胞核中。就这样，走几步，人们就能在“人类世界的阶梯”上跨出难以思议的一步。它还告诉人们，在人类的认识上，仅以简单的十进位递增或递减就可以大大深化人类对自己的认识。当显微至千万亿分之一时，人类对自己的认识便已经从表皮深入到最基本的物质结构层“夸克”了。
    正当人们的思绪奔驰神往，沉浸在对自身物质的无限认识中时，突然，夜幕降临了。然而，那不是科学隧道的尽头，人们抬头看到了无限的苍穹，满天的繁星银光闪烁。再往前走，则是一个别开生面的展览厅。里面用图片、模型介绍“昆虫的进化与研究”。
    随着地铁旅客的人流，我们折回了科学隧道的另一侧，遨游宏观世界。与微观的旅行相似，首幅图片是一个躺着的正常比例的人。然后以十进位递增，视野也就渐渐地开阔。开始，图片上的人是躺在草地上。放大十倍后，人们看到草地仅是纵横交叉的公路中间的一小块绿地，再进１位数，是城市的鸟瞰了；进到７位数时，城市已经淹没在辽阔的北美大陆里了；进到８位数，人们看到了自己生存的地球；进到１０位数，偌大的地球原来只是宇宙中的一个小点而已；进到１４位数，人们看到了太阳系；进到２０位数，太阳系也只落得一片模糊的光点；直到１后面加上２５个零，人们终于发现整个宇宙所有的星球看来都只是一些微粒。那是无穷的宏观世界。
    漫步在科学的隧道里，母亲向孩子指点着宇宙，学生悄悄地在小本上记录。旅客的眼睛里闪过一丝惊异的亮光，那是科学与智慧的火花。
