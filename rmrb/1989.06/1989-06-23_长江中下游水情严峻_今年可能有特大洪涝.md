Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, June 23rd (Reporter Liu Xiaoning) The Yangtze River basin may experience major floods this year, according to information released at the recent meeting of the Yangtze River Middle and Lower Reaches Flood Control Command Center held in Jiujiang City.

Representatives from Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Shanghai, as well as officials from the National Flood Control Command Center and the Ministry of Water Resources, conducted a comprehensive analysis of the flood situation in the Yangtze River. This year, the rainy season in the Yangtze River basin started early. Since April, heavy rains have been frequent. Pre-flood rainfall in the upper reaches has increased by four to six times compared to the average, while in the lower reaches, it has increased by three times. The rivers, lakes, and reservoirs in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are all at higher water levels, and many reservoirs are overfilled. The two major "water reservoirs" of the Yangtze River—Poyang Lake and Dongting Lake—are both full. Due to the heavy rainfall, which is double the usual amount, the Danjiangkou Reservoir in the Hanjiang River basin has opened its gates to release water. Currently, the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are in the plum rain season, and the climate is abnormal, making it highly likely that floods will occur.

The representatives from various provinces and cities at the meeting emphasized the need to prepare for the worst and ensure that all flood control measures are in place. Currently, the flood control standards for the levees in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River are low. If a super-standard major flood occurs, the State Council's plan for defending against major floods on the Yangtze River will be strictly implemented, and flood diversion measures will be taken to sacrifice local interests for the greater good.

In related news, the National Flood Control Command Center Office reported on June 23rd that since June 5th, due to continuous rainfall in the upper reaches of the Yellow River above the Longyangxia Reservoir, a significant flood has occurred in the upper reaches of the Yellow River. Due to the continuous drought in the upper reaches of the Yellow River since 1986, water for electricity generation and irrigation has been very scarce. This flood has eased the water shortage situation.

### 长江中下游水情严峻  今年可能有特大洪涝

　　长江中下游水情严峻  今年可能有特大洪涝
    据新华社南昌６月２３日电（记者刘小宁）长江流域今年很有可能出现特大洪涝灾害，这是近日在九江市结束的长江中下游防汛总指挥部指挥长会议上传出的信息。
    来自长江中下游的湖南、湖北、江西、安徽、江苏、上海五省一市以及国家防汛总指挥部、水利部的负责同志，对长江的汛情进行了全面分析。今年长江流域雨季提前，从４月开始，大雨频繁，汛前降雨量与常年相比，上游增加四至六成，下游增加了三成，长江中下游江、湖、水库普遍底水偏高，水库超蓄情况严重。长江的两大“蓄水池”——鄱阳湖和洞庭湖的水均已蓄满，汉江流域由于降雨量比往年多一倍，致使丹江口水库已开闸泄洪。而目前长江中下游流域正值梅雨季节，且气候异常，极易出现洪涝。
    各省市负责同志在会上表示，一定要立足于来大水、抗大灾，切实做好今年的各项防汛准备工作。目前，长江中下游堤防防洪标准低，一旦出现超标准特大洪水，将坚决地、不折不扣地执行国务院关于防御长江特大洪水的方案，采取分蓄洪措施，主动牺牲局部利益顾全大局。
    又讯　据国家防汛总指挥部办公室６月２３日提供消息，６月５日以来，由于黄河龙羊峡水库以上地区连续降雨，黄河上游目前出现了较大洪水。由于黄河上游１９８６年以来连续干旱，发电、灌溉等工农业用水很紧张，这次洪水缓和了缺水局面。
