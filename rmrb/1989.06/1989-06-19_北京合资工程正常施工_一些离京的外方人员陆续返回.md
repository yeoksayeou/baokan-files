	Beijing Joint-Venture Projects Continue Normal Construction
	Some Foreign Personnel Return to Beijing

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Beijing: (Reporter Li Li) The construction site of the China International Trade Center, with the giant words "A Place Where 1 Billion People Meet the World," is bustling with activity. Construction elevators are constantly moving up and down, and workers are diligently working in an orderly manner.

	Relevant officials from the Beijing Municipal Commission of Urban Construction told the reporter that the more than 40 ongoing Sino-foreign joint-venture projects were affected to some extent during the recent turmoil and riots, but construction has generally returned to normal.

	A survey report on Sino-foreign joint-venture projects indicates that out of the 35 projects surveyed, 6 are either completely or partially halted. Of these, 3 projects have stopped due to foreign investors suspending funds, and another 3 have halted because foreign engineering and technical personnel have left Beijing. Projects such as the Overseas Chinese Building and the Beijing Development Building, despite the withdrawal of some foreign investors and foreign engineering and technical personnel, have not stopped construction and are proceeding normally.

	The Beijing Jingguang Center, located at the intersection of Dongsanhuan Road and Hujialou Road, is currently the tallest skyscraper in Beijing and the entire country. This 208-meter-high comprehensive multifunctional building, jointly constructed by Beijing and Japan, has completed its main structure and exterior decoration. The Chinese and Japanese sides are working hard to expedite the interior decoration. After the turmoil and riots in Beijing, the Japanese personnel and foreign construction teams subcontracted here successively left Beijing. However, all Chinese engineering and technical personnel and workers have remained at their posts. According to relevant sources, this is the case for all Sino-foreign joint-venture construction projects in Beijing.

	Currently, some foreign investors who had previously suspended funds have resumed payments, and some foreign engineering and technical personnel and foreign representatives who had left Beijing are gradually returning.

　　北京合资工程正常施工
    一些离京的外方人员陆续返回
    据新华社北京电  （记者李莉）写有“１０亿人民与世界相会之地”巨大字样的中国国际贸易中心工地上，施工电梯不停地起落，工人们正在紧张有序地劳动。
    北京市城乡建设委员会有关人士告诉记者，正在施工的４０多项中外合资工程，前一时期因动乱和暴乱受到影响，但施工基本正常。
    一份对中外合资工程进行的调查报告表明，在３５个接受了调查的工程项目中，有６个处于停工或半停工状态，其中３项工程停工原因是外商暂停拨款；另３项停工原因是外方工程技术人员离京；华侨大厦、北京发展大厦等２９项工程，虽也有外商及外方工程技术人员撤走，但工程并未停工，施工基本正常。
    位于北京东三环路呼家楼路口的北京京广中心大厦，是目前北京以及我国最高的摩天大楼。这座由北京与日本合资共建的２０８米高的综合性多功能大厦，主体结构和外装修工程已经完成，中日双方正在努力抓紧进行内装修工程。北京发生动乱和暴乱后，日方人员以及在此分包工程的国外建筑队伍相继离京，但中方全体工程技术人员和工人始终坚守岗位。据有关方面介绍，北京所有中外合资建筑工程的中方人员都是如此。
    目前，已有一些前一时期暂停拨款的外商恢复了拨款；一些离京的外国工程技术人员、外方代表等陆续返京。
