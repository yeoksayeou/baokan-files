French President's First Visit to Poland
Mitterrand Arrives in Warsaw

At the invitation of the Chairman of the Polish Council of State, Jaruzelski, French President Mitterrand arrived in Warsaw on June 14 for a three-day official visit to Poland.

This is the first time Mitterrand has visited Poland as the French President.

Poland and France have a long history of traditional friendly relations. However, since the early 1980s when Poland implemented martial law, relations between the two countries began to deteriorate, and France participated in economic sanctions against Poland. With the lifting of martial law in Poland and the gradual stabilization of the political situation, relations between the two countries began to thaw. In February of this year, Polish Prime Minister Rakowski visited France, and in April, the French Foreign Minister visited Poland. President Mitterrand's visit to Poland this time signifies the formal end of the nearly 10-year period of strained relations between the two countries.

During his visit to Poland, in addition to holding talks with Polish leaders such as Jaruzelski, Mitterrand will also meet with the Chairman of the Polish Solidarity Trade Union, Walesa, and the head of the Polish Church, Glemp.

Poland hopes to rebuild close political relations with France and, more importantly, to restore and develop economic relations between the two countries. In the 1970s, France was consistently Poland's second-largest trading partner in the West, second only to West Germany.

France is Poland's second-largest creditor in the West. Currently, Poland owes France approximately $3.7 billion in loans. To ease the burden of repaying foreign debts and to help the country get out of its economic difficulties as soon as possible, Poland not only hopes to obtain new loans from France but also hopes that France will invest more in Poland.

It is expected that Poland and France will sign an agreement to adjust the debt repayment issues for the years 1986-1988.

### 法国总统首次访问波兰  密特朗抵达华沙

　　法国总统首次访问波兰
    密特朗抵达华沙
    新华社华沙６月１４日电  （记者董福生）应波兰国务委员会主席雅鲁泽尔斯基的邀请，法国总统密特朗１４日抵达华沙，对波兰进行为期３天的正式访问。
    这是密特朗作为法国总统首次访问波兰。
    波法两国在历史上有着传统的友好关系。但自８０年代初波兰实行军管以后，两国关系开始恶化，法国参加了对波兰的经济制裁活动。随着波兰军管的取消和政治形势的日趋稳定，两国关系逐渐解冻。今年２月，波兰总理拉科夫斯基访问法国，４月法国外长访问了波兰。密特朗总统这次访波，意味着两国关系近１０年的冷淡时期正式结束。
    密特朗总统访波期间，除了同雅鲁泽尔斯基等波兰领导人会谈外，还将会见波兰团结工会主席瓦文萨和波兰教会首脑格莱姆普。
    波兰希望同法国重建密切的政治关系，更希望恢复和发展两国的经济关系。７０年代，法国一直是波兰在西方的第二大贸易伙伴，仅次于西德。
    法国是波兰在西方第二大债权国，目前波兰欠法国的贷款大约为３７亿美元。为了缓和偿还外债的负担和尽早使国家摆脱经济困境，波兰不仅希望从法国获得新的贷款，而且希望法国能更多地向波兰投资。
    预计，波法两国将就调整１９８６—１９８８年的还债问题签署一项协议。
