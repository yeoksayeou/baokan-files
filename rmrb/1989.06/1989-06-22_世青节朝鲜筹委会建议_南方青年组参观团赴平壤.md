The organizing committee for the 13th World Youth Festival in Korea issued a statement today, suggesting that if South Korean youth students face difficulties in attending the festival as a delegation, they can visit Pyongyang as a sightseeing group.

The statement said that the current South Korean authorities are using the excuse that the "World Youth Festival has political implications" to prevent South Korean youth students from going to Pyongyang. The Korean organizing committee believes that if South Korean youth students form a sightseeing group to visit Pyongyang, it will not only demonstrate their patriotic desire to end national division and restore the appearance of a unified country but also avoid unnecessary troubles.

The statement also formally invites South Korean political figures and opposition figures to form a "Committee to Participate in the Pyongyang Festival" and attend the World Youth Festival as honorary guests.

    世青节朝鲜筹委会建议
    南方青年组参观团赴平壤
    本报平壤6月21日电  记者徐宝康报道：第13届世界青年联欢节朝鲜筹委会今天再次发表声明说，如果南朝鲜青年学生以代表团名义参加世青节有困难的话，也可以以参观团的名义前往平壤。
    声明说，目前南朝鲜当局正以“世青节带政治性质”为借口，企图阻挡南朝鲜青年学生前往平壤。朝鲜筹委会认为，南朝鲜青年学生组成参观团前往平壤，既表现了他们希望结束民族分裂和恢复祖国统一面貌的爱国之心，又可以避免麻烦。
    声明还正式邀请南朝鲜政界和在野人士组成“参加平壤联欢节指导委员会”，以名誉宾客的身份参加世青节。
