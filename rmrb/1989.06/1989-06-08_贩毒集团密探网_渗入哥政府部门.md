The Colombian Attorney General's Office has recently launched an investigation into a spy network that sells information to drug trafficking syndicates. According to the analysis, this intelligence network may have infiltrated government departments and diplomatic circles.

On May 25, Colombian police arrested two suspicious individuals in the northern region of Bogotá who were providing intelligence to drug trafficking syndicates. Important documents they were carrying were also seized. These documents detailed the operations of the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA) in Colombia, including sensitive information that only the Colombian National Security Council had access to. The fact that such crucial documents ended up in the hands of the drug syndicates' spies has raised high alert among relevant Colombian authorities.

　　贩毒集团密探网
    渗入哥政府部门
    本报加拉加斯６月７日电  记者朱满庭报道：最近，哥伦比亚检察院对一个向贩毒集团出售情报的密探网展开调查，据分析，这个情报网可能已渗入政府部门和外交界。
    ５月２５日，哥伦比亚警方在波哥大北部地区抓获两名为贩毒集团提供情报的可疑分子。他们所携带的一份重要文件也被查获，这份文件是关于美国缉毒局（ＤＥＡ）在哥伦比亚进行工作的情况的，详细说明了只有哥伦比亚国家安全委员会内部掌握的一些事情，这样重要的文件竟落到贩毒集团的密探手中，引起了哥伦比亚有关部门的高度警惕。
