The editorial of April 26, 1989, in the People's Daily and the important speech made by Comrade Li Peng on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council on May 19 both clearly stated that we must firmly oppose the turmoil and stop it. To this end, the State Council issued a command on May 20 to impose martial law in certain areas of Beijing, dispatching part of the military to Beijing along with the Public Security Forces and police to maintain social order in the capital, and to restore normal production, work, teaching, research, and living conditions in the capital.

However, many people and students still do not fully understand this, and there are still some "knots" in their minds. Some people wonder, since the students are patriotic, why is it said that there has been turmoil? Since the students are patriotic, why is it necessary to send the PLA? The root of the problem is that there is insufficient understanding of the seriousness of this political struggle and the necessity of martial law. Therefore, it is necessary to explain the actual situation to the broad masses and young students.

1. Why is it said that Beijing has experienced serious turmoil?

First of all, the Party and the government have always affirmed the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of young students and have never said that the students are causing turmoil. The April 26 editorial in the People's Daily, the speech by Comrade Li Peng on behalf of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the speeches by Marshal Xu Xianqian and Marshal Nie Rongzhen, the letter by Comrade Deng Yingchao, the speech by Comrade Chen Yun at the Standing Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, the speech by Comrade Li Xiannian at the National People's Congress, the speech by Comrade Peng Zhen at a meeting with some leaders of democratic parties, the written speech by Comrade Wan Li, and the speech by Comrade Li Peng all repeatedly and clearly pointed out that the broad masses of young students, in promoting democracy, eliminating corruption, rectifying "official profiteering," and overcoming bureaucratism, have made positive contributions. This fully shows that the Party and the government have never said that the students are causing turmoil. At the same time, they have always distinguished the conspiracy activities of a few people to create turmoil from the patriotic enthusiasm of young students.

So, how did a few people exploit the good intentions of the broad masses of young students, the confusion of some people's minds, the mistakes of the Party and the government, and the difficulties encountered in the process of advancement to create turmoil? Everyone can see from the series of extremely abnormal situations that have occurred in recent periods and draw the correct conclusion.

First, the few people who created the turmoil had a premeditated plan.

As early as the end of last year and the beginning of this year, a few people had been secretly plotting in some colleges and universities to use the 70th anniversary of May 4th, the 40th anniversary of the founding of the nation, and the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution as opportunities to incite student movements and stir up trouble.

In early March, some unsigned big-character posters appeared in universities such as Peking University and Tsinghua University, directly attacking the Party's leadership and the socialist system. A small poster titled "Lament for the Chinese People" said that the current government is "dictatorial and autocratic," calling on everyone to "fight for freedom." A big-character poster titled "The Call of the Times" raised the question of whether "socialism still has the rationality to exist" and "what philosophical system should replace Marxism-Leninism." In the "Triangle Area" of Peking University, a letter titled "A Letter to the Broad Masses of Young Students" was posted, advocating for fighting for "democracy, freedom, and human rights" under the leadership of a scholar who promotes bourgeois liberalization. In society, some people frequently held meetings and were very active. This scholar praised these meetings for taking a "completely confrontational and thorough critique" attitude towards the authorities, saying that the "gunpowder smell" was very strong and predicting that "such meetings would lead to street protests after being held three times." On April 15, after the death of Comrade Hu Yaobang, some people thought the time had come and decided to make a big fuss.

Second, the political goal of the few people was to negate the leadership of the Communist Party and the socialist system.

A letter signed "Tianjin University" proposed: "Establish a Constitutional Amendment Committee to remove the 'principles' and 'uphold' that are deeply hated by the people from the Constitution." The leader of the illegal organization "Human Rights Alliance," Ren Yutian, said in a speech at Tiananmen Square: "If the Four Cardinal Principles cannot be removed from the Constitution... they will be suspended above the interests of the people," attacking "the false harmony and stability of our society, which is achieved at the cost of universal high-pressure policies and the blood, lives, and loss of freedom and health of millions of outstanding talents." A big-character poster posted at Peking University said: "Marxism is equal to utopianism, Mao Zedong is a complete scoundrel, and without thoroughly negating Mao Zedong Thought, reform has no real meaning." A signed article by a "doctoral student" at Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics attacked our socialist public ownership system as "premature in the historical development process," "restraining the development of productive forces," "the soil for bureaucratism," "the breeding ground for corruption," and "the cradle of authoritarianism," advocating for "ringing the death knell of public ownership early to welcome the future of the republic."

The few people, in their articles and big-character posters, ignored the fact that great achievements had been made in the past ten years of reform, and slandered our socialist country as "pitch-black," "at the most critical moment," "official profiteering rampant, corruption and decadence," "China is dying, the people are degenerating, everything is dying," advocating for the overthrow of our socialist system.

Someone at Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics posted a "Letter to All Compatriots," demanding "the abolition of the Communist Party and the implementation of a multi-party system," "the abolition of party branches and political work cadres in all organizations, schools, and units." Some big-character posters openly proposed "the abolition of parties and the removal of the Four Cardinal Principles." Some big-character posters attacked the Communist Party of China as "a band of traitors," saying that "it only cares about its own position and not the future of the country and the nation," "the Communist Party of today is an organization that is about to collapse," and even slandered, "from history to the present, everything the Communist Party has done is corrupt, authoritarian, and treacherous. The Communist Party has no good points." Some big-character posters attacked the Communist Party of China as "having lost its role as the vanguard of the advanced elements of the proletariat, and is just another group of disguised rulers of the thousand-year-old feudal autocratic system in China." Some people openly shouted to overthrow the "autocratic rule" of the Communist Party of China. Some proposed to "invite the Kuomintang back to the mainland to establish a two-party political system."

Because Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always insisted on the Four Cardinal Principles and opposed bourgeois liberalization, he is the chief architect of China's reform and opening up and modernization drive, enjoying high prestige both inside and outside the Party and the country, so the few people have always directed their attacks at Comrade Deng Xiaoping, using extremely vicious and even vulgar language to slander and curse him.

The Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of our country. If the Four Cardinal Principles are abolished and the leadership of the Communist Party is negated, is there any other way except to follow the capitalist path?

Third, the turmoil created by the few people was meticulously planned and involved the intervention of various political forces at home and abroad.

In the past month, every stage of the turmoil, every action taken, every slogan shouted, and every demand made were all carefully planned and meticulously arranged.

When the turmoil began, under the planning of the few people, they used the tactic of "shooting arrows in all directions" to attack the Four Cardinal Principles comprehensively and to attack the Party and state leaders by name. On April 18 and 19, after the storming of Zhongnanhai, the targets of the attacks were concentrated on Comrade Deng Xiaoping and Comrade Li Peng. After the April 26 editorial in the People's Daily exposed the essence of the turmoil created by the few people, they made a 180-degree strategic turn, raising slogans and banners such as "Support the Communist Party of China," "Support Socialism," and "Support the Constitution." Later, when they saw that the Party and the government had taken a very restrained attitude, they put away these "support" slogans and banners. After May 4th, the situation reversed, and their slogans changed again, with "Overthrow Deng Xiaoping" becoming widespread and rampant. After Comrade Li Peng's important speech on May 19, they first shouted to overthrow both Deng Xiaoping and Li Peng, and then made a strategic adjustment, proposing "not to shout extreme slogans, especially against Deng Xiaoping," hoping to "win over Deng Xiaoping, which is beneficial for the next step of the struggle," and thus concentrated on inciting "overthrow Li Peng and the fake government."

Some people think that if the central leadership had talked to the students earlier, the problem would not have become so big. In fact, this is not the case. Under the planning of the few people, the organizers of the student movement, on the one hand, expressed their willingness to talk to the government, and on the other hand, proposed various preconditions and spread rumors that the government had no sincerity. In fact, they obstructed the dialogue and deliberately created obstacles for the dialogue. They first proposed to send 20 representatives to talk to the government, and the government agreed, but they then proposed to send 200 people, and instead spread rumors that the government only allowed them 20 people, making the dialogue unable to proceed as scheduled. On the morning of May 13, the General Office of the Central Committee and the General Office of the State Council notified them to have a dialogue on the 15th, and they expressed their agreement to the dialogue on the one hand, but on the other hand, they quickly issued the "Hunger Strike Declaration" that they had prepared in advance, falsely claiming that the government had refused to dialogue, and pushed some students to the forefront of the hunger strike.

During the student movement, a few people who knew the core secrets of the Central Committee even sent people to some colleges and universities and Tiananmen Square to spread rumors and incite trouble. Sometimes, a few hours after the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee had a meeting, the situation discussed had not been officially conveyed, but it was quickly revealed in some colleges and universities. Different opinions of the central leadership on the student movement were also widely spread by a few people with ulterior motives, causing serious confusion of thought among the masses.

In this student movement, various political forces at home and abroad intervened, offering advice and strategies, and responding internally and externally. Members of the reactionary organization "Chinese Democratic Alliance," Hu Ping and Chen Jun, signed a letter from New York on April 22, which was posted in Beijing universities, urging the organizers of the student movement to "strengthen the organizational connections established in this activity and strive to act effectively as a strong group," and currently "to take the thorough negation of the 1987 anti-liberalization movement as a breakthrough," "strengthen contacts with various news media," "strengthen contacts with other sectors of society... and seek their support and participation in the movement." The two heads of the "Chinese Democratic Alliance," Wang Bingzhang and Tang Guangzhong, hurriedly flew from New York to Tokyo, attempting to rush back to Beijing and directly intervene in the turmoil. A group of former members of "China Spring" residing in the United States formed the "Chinese Democratic Party" and issued a "Letter to All Compatriots" on April 16 to several universities in Beijing, inciting students to "demand the resignation of conservative bureaucrats" and "urge the Communist Party to end its autocratic rule."

All of this shows that the few people, in collusion with external forces and in collusion with internal forces, meticulously planned, is this not a deliberate creation of turmoil? The broad masses of young students and the people must not use their good intentions to view the extremely complex political struggle.

Fourth, the few people used extremely despicable means such as spreading rumors and inciting trouble, making the situation worse.

Since the student movement, Beijing has been shrouded in various rumors. What is particularly thought-provoking is that every time the government takes measures to ease the student movement, and the emotions of the broad masses of students tend to calm down, someone will create new rumors and incite new trouble, stirring up the student movement.

On April 15, after the death of Comrade Hu Yaobang, someone spread a rumor saying: "Li Peng cursed Hu Yaobang at the Politburo meeting, and Hu was angered to death."

On April 20, after the storming of Zhongnanhai, some people who had gathered in front of Zhongnanhai were sent back to school by the on-duty police on large transport vehicles before dawn. In this process, there were incidents of mutual pushing and fighting between the two sides. Someone then spread a rumor that "the police beat people at Zhongnanhai, not only students but also workers, women, and children," "more than 1,000 scientific and technological workers were killed in the bloodbath," and fabricated the so-called "April 20 Massacre." At the same time, they fabricated a rumor that a police car had run over a student from the Normal University, arousing the sympathy and anger of many students who did not know the truth.

On April 22, after the memorial service for Comrade Hu Yaobang, someone spread a rumor on Tiananmen Square that "Premier Li Peng promised to come out at 12:45 to meet the students," but in fact, there was no such thing, and then the rumor spread that Li Peng had "deceived the students," causing 60,000 students to go on strike, further escalating the student movement.

On April 23, students from some universities in the capital went on strike, and a few people, in order to incite workers to cause trouble, fabricated a leaflet signed by the "Beijing Workers' Union" and distributed it everywhere.

After the April 26 editorial in the People's Daily was published, a few people spread rumors saying, "Comrade Chen Yun has given eight instructions on this student movement, and the General Secretary and the Premier should take responsibility," "the president of Peking University has resigned." Some people also spread rumors saying, "all banks in the world have stopped lending to China."

On May 13, some students from universities in Beijing went to Tiananmen Square to petition by hunger strike, and a few people, in order to expand the situation, spread rumors everywhere saying: "the workers of Beijing have gone on a general strike."

On May 20, after the State Council issued the order to impose martial law in certain areas of Beijing, someone spread rumors saying, "Li Peng chaired a meeting and made four decisions: first, to define this student movement as a rebellion; second, to suppress the 200,000 university students on Tiananmen Square; third, to vacate the major prisons in the capital to hold students; fourth, to mobilize all sanitation workers to clean up Tiananmen Square the next morning after the suppression." Later, they spread rumors that the troops would "parachute in" and "release gas," deliberately exacerbating the confrontation between students, citizens, and the PLA.

The few people relied on fabricating rumors to deceive the masses, creating chaos. When some of their rumors were exposed by facts, they changed their tactics and fabricated new rumors. The broad masses of good-hearted people and young students must be vigilant and must not easily believe them.

Fifth, the few people wantonly trampled on democracy and the legal system, causing serious disorder in social order.

In more than a month, under the instigation of a few people, some people ignored the ten regulations of the Beijing Municipal People's Congress Standing Committee on parades and demonstrations, organized parades, demonstrations, sit-ins, and hunger strikes without approval, and occupied Tiananmen Square for a long time, making it impossible for some major national events such as the Sino-Soviet high-level talks to proceed as planned, and some activities had to be canceled, seriously damaging our country's image and reputation.

Since May, the scale of parades has become larger and larger, developing from tens of thousands of people to hundreds of thousands of people, seriously disrupting and destroying the production, work, and social order of Beijing. Some people surrounded and stormed the offices of the Party Central Committee and the State Council and the residences of central leaders. Some hooligans shouted obscenities and disturbed the peace at the gates of the Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government at night. The public transportation order in the urban area was severely disrupted and once paralyzed. Factories could not transport raw materials in time, and products could not be transported out in time. Coal gas cylinders, vegetables, grain, and other transportation were obstructed. Stores and enterprises could not deposit money in banks on time. Some people arbitrarily deprived the police and traffic police of their command power, stopped vehicles at will, and illegally checked the certificates of pedestrians. Some lawbreakers insulted and even injured police and traffic police. Due to the increasingly serious state of anarchy, the police and armed police of Beijing City found it increasingly difficult to bear the heavy task of maintaining the normal order of the capital, and incidents of smashing, looting, and arson occurred in many places. Some lawbreakers took the opportunity to rob banks. Several dozen people rushed to the Huanyuan Department Store on Dongsi Street to rob. The 3,800 bottles of milk in a delivery truck from the Guang'anmen Dairy Factory were stolen. The No. 54 bus was smashed at the Yongdingmen Railway Station. Six thugs robbed farmers from Hebei Province on the road from Fangshan to Liangxiang, saying, "We heard that Beijing is in chaos, so we also want to make some money." During the parade, some thugs rushed to Wangfujing and the commercial area in front of the gate, waiting for an opportunity to commit crimes. Fortunately, the police and shopkeepers were prepared and did not dare to act.

More seriously, the situation in Beijing has spread to the whole country, and many cities have fallen into chaos. In some places, there have been multiple incidents of storming local Party and government leadership agencies, and serious illegal and destructive activities such as beating, smashing, looting, and burning have occurred. The national transportation arteries have been blocked, and students from many places have forcibly boarded trains to come to Beijing, even lying on the tracks to stop trains. The number of students coming to Beijing in advance and later reached more than 200,000, riding without buying tickets and eating without paying, with the same spirit as the "Great Link-up" during the Cultural Revolution.

Sixth, the few people attempted to seize power in the chaos.

Under the instigation of a few people, some universities openly abolished the student unions and graduate student unions elected through elections and established so-called "self-governing" student organizations, and seized the broadcasting stations. These organizations then joined forces to become the first-line command center of this student movement.

Before martial law was imposed, the situation became more and more serious. Some units were brewing to demand that the leaders "hand over power." Some departments of the State Council had people demanding the resignation of the ministers. Some people distributed leaflets, claiming to establish the "Preparatory Committee for the People's Congress of All Circles in Beijing," to replace the Beijing Municipal People's Congress, and advocated the establishment of the "Beijing District Government" to replace the legitimate Beijing Municipal People's Government. Some people attacked the State Council, which was elected by law, as a "fake government," falsely claiming that the Central Government had already announced that more than ten departments, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, had "declared independence" and separated from the State Council, and that more than 30 countries in the world had severed diplomatic relations with us. Someone claimed, "Deng Xiaoping has stepped down," and three days later, a "new government" would be established.

The few people gathered hooligans and rascals, organizing a "Flying Tiger Corps" of more than 100 motorcycles and a "Suicide Squad" of more than 1,000 bicycles, ordering them to "rise up in rebellion" like the French Revolution, to "attack the Bastille," and even threatening to "detain" Party and state leaders.

All these facts, are they not serious turmoil? In such a chaotic situation, in order to maintain social order in Beijing, to ensure the safety of citizens' lives and property, to ensure that public property is not infringed upon, and to ensure that the central state organs and the Beijing Municipal Government can carry out their duties normally, the State Council decided, according to the Constitution, to impose martial law in certain areas of Beijing, which is completely necessary. If we do not take decisive measures and allow this chaotic situation to continue, the capital will face more serious turmoil, the country will be in chaos, and what hope is there for our various reforms and the cause of the Four Modernizations? It is obvious that this is not what the 1.1 billion people of the country want to see.

2. Some misunderstandings about the imposition of martial law.

Some people ask, since the students who went on a hunger strike at Tiananmen Square announced the suspension of the hunger strike on the evening of May 19, why was martial law imposed on May 20?

There are two points that need to be explained here:

First, the announcement of martial law in certain areas of Beijing is to stop the turmoil, eliminate the serious state of anarchy, restore the normal order of the capital, and prevent the occurrence of more serious turmoil, not to solve the problem of some students' hunger strike.

Second, after the State Council decided to impose martial law in certain areas of Beijing, the news quickly leaked out. A few people, in order to deal with us, rushed to come up with strategies and tried to mobilize the suspension of the hunger strike and change it to a sit-in. This precisely shows that it is a strategic move by a few people.

Some people ask, since the order in Beijing has basically returned to normal, why is it still necessary to impose martial law?

First of all, it should be pointed out that in the extremely difficult situation over the past month, the broad masses of workers, peasants, commercial workers, teachers, medical workers, street cadres, Party and government officials, and the broad masses of police and armed police have stood their posts and performed their duties, making important contributions to ensuring the normal production and work of the people of the capital. Especially after the announcement of martial law, the troops arrived in Beijing, and all parties made arduous efforts. The current situation is the result of the broad masses of cadres and the people resisting the turmoil.

However, it cannot be ignored that the situation of turmoil in Beijing has not been pacified just because we have done some work. In the first two days of martial law, all traffic intersections were blocked, 227 buses were intercepted and used as barricades. All military vehicles were not allowed to enter the city, and the transmission of documents between government agencies was also difficult for a time. Now, unauthorized parades, demonstrations, and sit-ins are still continuing. The residence of the Party Central Committee and the State Council is still being besieged. Inciting speeches can be seen everywhere on the streets. Rumor-spreading leaflets are everywhere. Most colleges and universities have not resumed classes. A few people are still secretly planning to fight the government to the end. From this, it can be seen that stopping the turmoil and restoring the normal order of the capital is still a very serious task.

Some people think that during the students' hunger strike, if the government had shown more concern and done more work, the situation might have eased, and there would have been no need to impose martial law.

In fact, since the hunger-striking students entered Tiananmen Square, the Party and the government have been very anxious and have done everything possible in all aspects. First, school staff, cadres at all levels, and even Party and state leaders have visited them many times to guide their thoughts. Second, with the help of the Red Cross Society, more than 100 ambulances were dispatched, and hundreds of medical staff were mobilized to guard the hunger strike site day and night, and 52 hospitals were mobilized to reserve nearly 2,000 beds to ensure that students who fainted or fell ill due to hunger strike could be rescued and treated in time. Third, various materials were provided to reduce the pain of the hunger-striking students and ensure their safety. The Municipal Party Committee and the Municipal Government mobilized cadres, workers, and vehicles through the Red Cross Society to transport water to the hunger-striking students day and night, providing salt and sugar; the Environmental Sanitation Bureau provided watering trucks, basins, and towels for the hunger-striking students to wash; the Pharmaceutical Company provided sufficient anti-heatstroke, anti-cold, and anti-diarrhea medicines to the Red Cross Society for distribution; the Food Department transported a large amount of beverages and bread for emergency rescue of students; the Commercial Department transported 6,000 straw hats, and the Beijing Military Region sent 1,000 quilts to protect the hunger-striking students from the heat during the day and the cold at night; to maintain the hygiene of the hunger strike site, temporary toilets were set up, and environmental sanitation workers also cleaned the hunger strike site in the middle of the night; before the heavy rain on the 18th, 78 large buses were mobilized from the Public Transport Company, and more than 400 thick wooden boards were mobilized from the Material Bureau to protect the hunger-striking students from the rain and moisture. All of this shows that the Party and the government, as well as the whole society, have taken a very caring, loving, and responsible attitude towards the hunger-striking students, and it is not that the Party and the government do not care about the hunger-striking students, but that a few people are using the hunger-striking students as hostages to force the government to accept their political conditions. The development of the situation to this day has fully proven this.

Some people think that the martial law troops are here to suppress the students and the people. This is even more of a misunderstanding.

Since the imposition of martial law, the martial law troops, armed police, and police have been disciplined and restrained, maintaining a very restrained and tolerant attitude in the face of being misunderstood and even insulted and beaten by some people. Since the imposition of martial law, not a single student has been arrested, but more than 60 martial law troops and hundreds of police and armed police have been injured. They have proven with their actions that they are the people's army, a military that serves the people wholeheartedly. They are here to carry out the martial law mission in the capital and are not here to deal with the people and young students. The actions of the martial law troops, armed police, and police have been understood and supported by more and more people and students, and they have received the enthusiastic care and support of the people.

3. Unite all forces that can be united, expose the few people who incite and create turmoil.

In a month's time, a large number of students participated in parades, demonstrations, and sit-ins, and some students participated in the hunger strike. A large number of citizens, workers, and even office workers participated in the parades and support activities. The patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of students should be fully affirmed; the concern and sympathy of the broad masses of people for the students should also be understood. At present, some students and the masses are worried about being labeled as "participating in the turmoil" in the future. Here, we should make it clear to everyone:

First, the Party and the government firmly protect the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of young students and firmly distinguish them from the few people who create turmoil. Even if they have some extreme words and deeds in the turmoil, they will not be pursued. The dialogue between the Party and the government and the broad masses of students and people from all walks of life, including the students who participated in the parades, demonstrations, strikes, and hunger strikes, will continue to be actively and extensively carried out through various levels, channels, and forms, fully listening to the opinions of all parties. For the reasonable demands raised by the students, clear answers will be given, and for their reasonable criticisms and suggestions, such as promoting democracy, punishing official profiteering, eliminating corruption, and overcoming bureaucratism, they will be seriously listened to and adopted to improve the work of the Party and the government.

Second, some workers, citizens, and office workers, out of dissatisfaction with corruption and official profiteering and sympathy for the hunger-striking students, participated in the support and parades in a situation where they did not understand many complex backgrounds, and some even said some outrageous things and did some outrageous things. Once they understand the truth, they will support the decisions made by the Central Committee and the State Council. They should also be welcomed and not pursued.

Third, for those who engage in smashing, looting, and arson, our armed police and police should closely cooperate with the martial law troops, rely on the broad masses of citizens and young students, and give them a resolute blow, especially to the "Flying Tiger Corps" and "Suicide Squad" and other hooligan political gangs, which must be resolutely smashed.

Fourth, those who incite and create turmoil must be resolutely exposed.

Fifth, the broad masses of Communist Party members, Young Pioneers, and the people of the whole city should closely unite around the Party Central Committee, adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, adhere to reform and opening up, firmly oppose and stop the turmoil, strictly observe discipline and law, and strive to do a good job in production and work, and make contributions to stopping the turmoil and stabilizing the situation at their respective posts.

### 认清动乱的实质和戒严的必要性

　　认清动乱的实质和戒严的必要性
    中共北京市委宣传部
    ４月２６日《人民日报》社论和５月１９日李鹏同志代表党中央、国务院所作的重要讲话，都十分明确地提出，要旗帜鲜明地反对动乱，制止动乱。为此，国务院于５月２０日发布了在北京市部分地区实行戒严的命令，派部分军队到北京来和武警部队、公安干警以及广大群众、青年学生一道，维护首都社会治安，恢复首都正常的生产、工作、教学、科研和生活秩序。
    但是，不少群众和学生对此还不很理解，思想上还有一些“扣”没有解开。有人认为，既然学生是爱国的，为什么又说发生了动乱？既然学生是爱国的，为什么又要派解放军来？说到底，还是对这场政治斗争的严重性以及戒严的必要性认识不足。因此，有必要把实际情况向广大群众和青年学生解释清楚。
    一、为什么说北京发生了严重的动乱？
    首先要说的是，党和政府一直对广大青年学生的爱国热情给予了充分的肯定，从来没有说过广大学生是在搞动乱。４月２６日《人民日报》社论，李鹏同志代表党中央、国务院所作的讲话，徐向前元帅、聂荣臻元帅的讲话和邓颖超同志的信，陈云同志在中顾委常委会上的讲话，李先念同志在全国政协主席会议上的讲话，彭真同志在部分民主党派负责人座谈会上的讲话，万里同志的书面谈话，都反复地、明确地指出，广大青年学生在推进民主、清除腐败、整治“官倒”、克服官僚主义等方面提出的要求，同党和政府的愿望是一致的，并对促进这些问题的解决起到了积极的作用。这就充分说明，党和政府从来没有说过广大学生在搞动乱。同时，又总是把极少数人制造动乱的阴谋活动，同青年学生的爱国热情严格区别开来。
    那么，极少数人到底是怎样利用广大青年学生的善良愿望，利用一些人的思想混乱，利用党和政府的某些失误，以及前进中遇到的困难，来制造动乱的呢？大家看一看近一个时期以来发生的一系列极不正常的情况，就不难做出正确的结论。
    第一，极少数人制造动乱是早有预谋的。
    早在去年年底和今年年初，极少数人就在一些高校内外密谋策划，要借“五四”７０周年、建国４０周年、法国大革命２００周年的时机，煽起学潮，挑起事端。
    今年３月初在北大、清华等高校相继发现了一些没有署名的大小字报，直接攻击党的领导，攻击社会主义制度。一份题为《为中国人悲哀》的小字报说，现在的政府是“独裁专制”，号召大家“为自由而战”。一份题为《时代的召唤》的大字报，提出了“社会主义还有没有存在的合理性”和“用什么样的哲学体系去取代马列主义”的问题。在北大“三角地”，还贴出一张《致广大青年学生的一封信》，鼓吹在某位搞资产阶级自由化的学者的领导下为“民主、自由、人权”而战。在社会上，一些人频繁集会，十分活跃。这位学者称赞这些集会“对当局采取完全抵制、彻底批判的态度”，“火药味很浓”，并且预言，“这种会连续开３次就要上街了”。４月１５日胡耀邦同志逝世，有些人认为时机已到，决心大闹一番。
    第二，极少数人的政治目的，就是要否定共产党的领导，否定社会主义制度。
    署名“南开大学”的《告全国青年学生书》提出：“成立宪法修改委员会，去除宪法中为人民所深恶痛绝的‘原则’和‘坚持’。”原非法组织“人权同盟”负责人任畹町，在天安门前演讲时说：“四项基本原则如果不能从《宪法》中消失……必将高悬于人民利益之上”，他攻击“我国社会表现的虚假的宽松和谐和安定团结，是以对全体人民普遍的高压政策和数百万优秀人才的鲜血、生命以及丧失自由和健康的代价换取的”。贴在北大的一张大字报说：“马克思主义等于乌托邦，毛泽东是一个十足的无赖，不彻底否定毛泽东思想，改革就没有实际意义。”张贴在北京航空航天大学的一篇署名“博士生”的《中国的希望——私有制宣言》，攻击我国的社会主义公有制“超前了历史发展规律”，“束缚生产力的发展”，是“产生官僚主义的土壤”，“贪污腐化的温床”，“集权专制的摇篮”，鼓吹要“早日敲响公有制的丧钟，去迎接共和国的明天”。
    极少数人在他们写的文章和大小字报中，不顾十年改革取得巨大成就的事实，把我们的社会主义国家诬蔑为“漆黑一团”，“到了最危机的时候”，“官倒横行，贪污腐化，道德沦丧”，“中国正在死去，人民正在堕落，一切都在死亡”，鼓吹要推翻我国的社会主义制度。
    北京航空航天大学有人贴出《告全体同胞书》，要求“取消共产党，实行多党制”，“取消各团体、学校、单位的党支部和政工干部”。有的大字报公开提出，要“取消党派，解除四项原则”。有的大字报攻击中国共产党是“一代奸党”，“它只是关心自己的地位，而不关心国家和民族的前途”，“中共今日正是一个即将溃灭之组织”，甚至诬蔑说，“从历史到现在，共产党所做的一切都是腐败、专制、卖国的。共产党没有一点好处”。有的大字报攻击中国共产党“已丧失了作为所谓无产阶级先进分子所组成的先锋队作用，不过是中国千年封建专制制度的又一批变相的当政者”。有的人公然叫嚷要打倒中国共产党的“专制统治”。有的提出要“邀请国民党回大陆，建立两党政治”。
    因为邓小平同志一贯坚持四项基本原则，坚持反对资产阶级自由化，是我国改革开放和现代化建设事业的总设计师，在党内外和国内外享有崇高的威望，所以，极少数人一直把攻击的矛头集中指向邓小平同志，以极其恶毒甚至下流的语言，进行了疯狂的诽谤和谩骂。
    四项基本原则是我们的立国之本。取消了四项基本原则，取消了共产党的领导，除了搞资本主义那一套，难道还有别的道路可走吗？
    第三，极少数人制造的这场动乱是周密策划的，是有国内外各种政治势力插手的。
    一个月来，动乱的每个阶段，采取的每个行动，喊出的口号，提出的要求，都是经过精心策划、周密安排的。
    动乱开始，在极少数人策划下，采取乱箭齐发的手法，全面攻击四项基本原则，指名道姓地逐个攻击党和国家领导人。４月１８日、１９日冲击中南海前后，攻击的矛头就集中到了邓小平和李鹏同志的身上。４月２６日《人民日报》社论揭露了极少数人制造动乱的本质之后，他们在策略上来了一个１８０度的大转弯，打出了“拥护中国共产党”、“拥护社会主义”、“拥护宪法”的标语口号。后来，当他们看到党和政府采取了十分克制的态度，又把这些“拥护”的口号、标语收了起来。“五四”以后，形势逆转，他们的口号又有了变换，“打倒邓小平”的口号又铺天盖地，甚嚣尘上。５月１９日李鹏同志发表重要讲话之后，他们先是既打倒邓小平又打倒李鹏，后又作了策略调整，提出“不要喊过激口号，特别是对邓小平”，妄想“把邓小平争取过来，对下一步斗争有利”，因而集中鼓噪“打倒李鹏和伪政府”。
    有些群众认为，如果中央领导早和学生对话，问题就不会闹这么大。实际上不是这么回事。在极少数人的策划下，学潮的组织者一方面表示愿意同政府对话，一方面却又提出种种先决条件，并宣传政府没有诚意。事实上是他们阻扰对话，竭力为对话制造障碍。他们先是提出要派２０名代表同政府对话，政府同意了，他们又提出要参加２００人，反而造谣说政府只限定他们２０人，使对话没有能如期进行。５月１３日上午，中央办公厅和国务院办公厅通知他们１５日进行对话，他们一方面表示赞成对话，一方面又急急忙忙地抛出了早就准备好的《绝食宣言》，谎称是政府拒绝对话，而把一些学生推上了绝食第一线。
    在学潮过程中，极少数得知中央核心机密的人，甚至派人到一些高校和天安门广场，通风报信，煽风点火。有时中央政治局常委会刚刚开过几小时，讨论的情况还未正式传达，就在一些高校很快披露了出来。中央领导层对学潮问题的不同意见，也被极少数别有用心的人广为传播，暴露在群众之中，造成了严重的思想混乱。
    在这次学潮中，国内外各种政治势力纷纷插手，出谋献策，内外呼应。反动组织“中国民主联盟”成员胡平、陈军等人，联名于４月２２日从美国纽约发出《致中国大学生公开信》，在北京高校中张贴，要学潮的组织者注意“巩固在这次活动中建立起来的组织联系，力求以一个坚强的群体进行有效的活动”，目前“应把彻底否定１９８７年反自由化运动作为突破口”，“加强与各种新闻媒介的联系”，“加强与社会其它各界的联系，……在运动中争取他们的支持和参与”。“中国民主联盟”的两个头头王炳章和汤光中也急忙从纽约飞往东京，企图闯回北京，直接插手动乱。一批身居美国的原《中国之春》成员，组成了“中国民主党”，于４月１６日向北京一些大学发出《告全国同胞书》，煽动学生“要求保守派官僚们下台”，“促使中共结束其专制统治”。
    所有这些都说明，极少数人内外勾结，上下串联，周密策划，难道不是蓄意制造动乱吗？广大青年学生和人民群众，决不可用自己善良的心意去看待极其复杂的政治斗争。
    第四，极少数人采取造谣煽动等极其卑劣的手段，使事态不断恶化。
    学潮以来，北京一直被各种谣言所笼罩。特别发人深思的是，每当政府采取措施，缓和学潮，广大学生情绪趋向平静时，总会有人造出新的谣言，进行新的煽动，刺激学潮升温。
    ４月１５日，胡耀邦同志逝世后，有人造谣说：“李鹏在政治局会议上大骂胡耀邦，胡被气死。”
    ４月２０日，发生冲击新华门事件，围聚在新华门前的一些人在拂晓前由值勤警察送上大型交通汽车送回学校。在这个过程中，双方曾发生互相推拉和厮打的现象。有人就造谣，“警察在新华门打人，不光打学生，还打了工人、女人和小孩”，“１０００多名科技工作者倒在血泊中”，编造了所谓“四·二○惨案”。与此同时，又制造什么警车轧死师范大学学生的谣言，引起了许多不明真相学生们的同情和愤怒。
    ４月２２日，胡耀邦同志追悼大会结束后，有人在天安门广场向学生散布谣言说，“李鹏总理答应１２点４５分出来接见学生”，实际上根本没有这回事，然后，就传开了李鹏“欺骗学生”的谣言，引起６万学生罢课，使学潮进一步升级。
    ４月２３日，首都一些高校学生纷纷罢课，极少数人为了煽动工人闹事，又捏造出署名“北京市工人联合会”的传单，到处散发。
    《人民日报》４月２６日社论发表后，极少数人造谣说，“陈云同志对这次学潮有八点指示，总书记和总理要负责任”，“北大校长已经辞职”。还有的人造谣说，“世界各银行一律停止对中国贷款”。
    ５月１３日，北京高校部分学生到天安门广场绝食请愿，极少数人为了扩大事态，到处造谣说：“北京市工人已经总罢工”。
    ５月２０日，国务院发布对北京部分地区实行戒严的命令后，就有人造谣说，“李鹏主持会议作出了四点决定：一是这次学生运动定性为叛乱；二是要镇压掉天安门广场上的２０万大学生；三是腾出首都各大监狱关学生；四是动员所有环卫工人在镇压后的次日清晨清扫天安门广场”。后来又造谣说，部队要“空降”，要“放瓦斯”，蓄意激化学生、市民同解放军的对立。
    极少数人就是靠编造谣言欺骗群众，来制造混乱的。当他们的一些谣言被事实戳穿后，又改头换面，炮制新的谣言，广大善良的群众和青年学生，对他们这种卑劣的手段，一定要提高警惕，万万不可轻信。
    第五，极少数人肆意践踏民主和法制，造成社会秩序的严重混乱。
    一个多月以来，在极少数人的挑动下，有些人置北京市人大常委会关于游行示威的十条规定于不顾，不经过批准，任意组织游行、示威、静坐、绝食，长时期占据天安门广场，使中苏高级会谈等一些重大国事活动不能按计划进行，有的活动项目不得不取消，严重损害了我们国家的形象和声誉。
    ５月以来，游行规模越来越大，由几万人发展到几十万、上百万人，使北京市的生产、工作和社会秩序受到严重干扰和破坏。有的围堵、冲击党中央、国务院的办公机关和中央领导同志的住所，一些流氓分子深夜窜到市委、市政府门口用极下流语言谩骂滋扰。城区公共交通秩序受到很大破坏，一度陷于瘫痪，工厂的原材料不能及时运进，产品不能及时运出，煤气罐、蔬菜、粮食等运输受到阻拦。商店、企业不能及时到银行交款。有的人擅自剥夺公安干警、交通干警的指挥权，随意拦截车辆，非法检查行人证件。有的不法分子肆意辱骂甚至打伤公安和交通干警。由于日益发展的严重无政府状态，北京市公安干警和武警部队已经越来越难于承担维护首都正常秩序的繁重任务，多处发生打砸抢事件。有的不法分子乘机抢劫银行。有几十个人窜到东四大街慧源百货商店行抢。广安门乳品厂一辆送奶车的３８００瓶牛奶被抢光。５４路公共汽车在永定门火车站被砸。６名歹徒在房山至良乡公路上抢劫由河北省进京的农民，说什么：“听说北京乱了，我们也弄点钱花。”在游行期间，有些歹徒窜到王府井、前门商业区，伺机作案，由于公安干警和护店职工有准备，没敢动手。
    更为严重的是，北京市的事态已经波及到全国，不少城市出现了混乱局面。有的地方，多次发生冲击当地党政领导机关的事件，发生了打、砸、抢、烧等严重违法破坏活动。国家的运输大动脉受阻，不少地方的学生强行乘车来京，甚至卧轨拦车，前后来京的学生达２０多万人，乘车不买票，吃饭不交钱，大有“文化大革命”时期大串联的那股子劲头。
    第六，极少数人企图借混乱之机，乱中夺权。
    在极少数人的挑唆下，一些大学公开宣布废除经过选举产生的学生会和研究生会，成立所谓“自治”学生组织，并夺取了广播站。随后这些组织又联合起来，成为这次学潮的第一线指挥中心。
    戒严之前，事态的发展越来越严重。有的单位酝酿要求领导“交权”。国务院有的部门，一些人要部长下台。一些人散发传单，宣称成立“北京市各界人民代表会议筹委会”，要取代市人民代表大会，并鼓吹成立“北京区政府”，取代合法的北京市人民政府。一些人攻击依法选举产生的国务院是“伪政府”，谎称中央已有外交部等十几个部“宣布独立”，脱离国务院，世界上有３０多个国家已同我国断绝外交关系。有人声言，“邓小平已下台”，三天后要成立“新政府”。
    极少数人纠集流氓地痞，组织了有一百多辆摩托车的“飞虎队”，还组织了上千辆自行车的“敢死队”，要他们“揭竿而起”，像法国大革命那样，“攻打巴士底狱”，并且扬言要“软禁”党和国家领导人。
    所有这些事实，难道还不是严重的动乱吗？在这种十分混乱的情况下，为了维护北京市的社会安宁，保障公民的生命和财产安全，保障公共财产不受侵犯，保障中央国家机关和北京市政府正常执行公务，根据宪法规定，国务院决定，在北京市部分地区实行戒严，是完全必要的。如果不采取果断措施，听任这种混乱局面继续发展下去，首都就会发生更大规模的动乱，全国就会大乱，我们的各项改革和四化建设大业还有什么希望？显而易见，这是全国１１亿人民所不愿意看到的。
    　　　　二、对实行戒严的一些认识问题。
    有些群众提出，既然天安门广场绝食的学生已经在１９日晚宣布停止绝食，为什么还在２０日实行戒严？
    这里有两点情况需要说明：
    第一，宣布北京市部分地区实行戒严，是为了制止动乱，消除严重的无政府状态，恢复首都的正常秩序，防止更大动乱的发生，而不是为了解决一些学生的绝食问题。
    第二，国务院关于在北京市部分地区实行戒严的决定作出之后，消息很快就走漏了出去。极少数人为了对付我们，就抢先出谋划策，设法动员停止绝食，改为静坐。这恰好说明是极少数人的一种策略手段。
    有些群众提出，既然北京的秩序基本恢复正常了，还有什么必要实行戒严？
    首先应当指出，一个月来，在极端困难的情况下，广大工人、农民、商业职工、教师、医务工作者、街道干部、党政机关工作人员和广大公安干警、武警，坚守岗位，尽职尽责，为保证首都人民正常的生产和工作，作出了重要贡献。特别是宣布戒严，部队到达北京之后，各方共同作了艰苦努力。目前的局面，正是广大干部和群众抵制动乱的结果。
    但是，不能不看到，北京市动乱的状况并没有因为我们做了工作就平息下来。戒严头两天，所有交通路口一度被封堵，２２７辆公共汽车被截，当作路障。所有军车不准进城，政府机关之间文件的传递也一度难以通过。现在，不经批准的游行、示威、静坐仍然接连不断。党中央、国务院驻地仍然被围堵。街头煽动性的演讲随处可见。制造谣言的传单比比皆是。大部分高等院校还没有复课。极少数人还在暗地策划，要同政府斗争到底。由此可见，制止动乱，恢复首都正常秩序，仍然是一项极为严重的任务。
    有些群众认为，在学生绝食期间，如果政府对他们热情关怀，多做工作，事态可能缓解，也就没有必要实行戒严了。
    实际上，从绝食学生一进入天安门广场，党和政府就怀着十分焦急的心情，竭尽全力，在各方面做了力所能及的工作。首先是学校工作人员、各级领导干部直到党和国家领导人，多次看望他们，进行思想疏导。其次是协助红十字会，先后调配了１００多辆救护车，抽调了数百名医护人员，昼夜守护在绝食现场，并动员５２家医院腾出近２０００张病床，保证因绝食休克或致病的学生及时得到救护和治疗。三是提供各种物资，尽可能地减少绝食学生的痛苦和保障他们的安全。市委、市政府抽调干部、工人和车辆，通过红十字会，昼夜为绝食学生运送饮水，提供食盐和食糖；环卫局调出了洒水车，配备了脸盆、毛巾，供绝食学生洗漱；医药公司调来充足的防中暑、防感冒、防腹泻药剂，交由红十字会分发；食品部门运来大量饮料、面包等，以备紧急抢救学生时使用；商业部门调运了６０００顶草帽，北京军区送来了１０００条棉被，供绝食学生白天避暑，晚上御寒；为保持绝食现场的卫生，搭起了临时冲洗厕所，环卫工人还趁深夜进行了绝食现场的大清扫；１８日大雨前，又从公交总公司抽调７８辆大客车，从物资局调来４００多块厚木板，供绝食学生避雨、隔潮。所有这些，说明党和政府以及全社会对绝食学生采取了十分关怀、爱护和负责的态度，并不是党和政府对绝食学生不关心，而是极少数人以绝食学生为人质，强迫政府接受他们的政治条件，事态发展到今天的局面，完全证明了这一点。
    有些群众认为，戒严部队是来镇压学生，镇压群众的。这更是一种误解。
    实行戒严以来，戒严部队、武警部队和公安干警纪律严明，在不被一些群众理解，甚至遭到侮辱打骂的情况下，始终保持十分克制和容忍的态度。戒严以来，没有一个学生被逮捕，倒是有６０多名戒严部队战士、几百名公安干警和武警战士被打伤。他们以自己的实际行动证明，他们是人民的子弟兵，是全心全意为人民服务的军队。他们是来首都执行戒严任务的，决不是对付群众和青年学生的。戒严部队、武警部队和公安干警的这种行动，已经被越来越多的群众和学生所理解，得到了群众的热情关怀和支持。
    　　　　三、团结一切可以团结的力量，揭露煽动和制造动乱的极少数人。
    在一个月的时间里，大批学生参加游行、示威、静坐，一部分学生参加绝食，大批市民、工人甚至机关工作人员，参加了游行和声援。对广大爱国学生的热情应当充分肯定；广大群众对学生的关心和同情，也应给以理解。目前，有些学生和群众担心的是怕将来被扣上“参加动乱”的帽子。在这里，我们应当向大家讲清楚：
    第一，党和政府坚决保护广大青年学生的爱国热情，坚决把他们同制造动乱的极少数人严格区别开来，即使他们在学潮中有一些过激言行，也不追究。党和政府同广大同学和各界人士之间的对话，包括同参加过游行、示威、罢课、绝食的同学之间的对话，还将通过多种层次、多种渠道和多种形式广泛积极地进行，充分听取各方面的意见。对学生提出的合理要求，将给予明确的答复，对他们提出的合理批评和建议，如推进民主、惩治官倒、消除腐败、克服官僚主义等，将认真听取和采纳，以切实改进党和政府的工作。
    　第二，一些工人、市民、机关干部，出于对腐败、官倒现象的不满和对绝食学生的同情，在不了解许多复杂背景的情况下，参加了声援和游行，有的甚至说了一些出格的话，做了一些出格的事。他们一旦明白了事实真相，是会拥护中央、国务院作出的决策的。对他们也应当欢迎，不予追究。
    第三，对于那些搞打砸抢的不法分子，我们的武警和公安干警应密切配合戒严部队，依靠广大市民和青年学生，给予坚决打击，特别对“飞虎队”、“敢死队”等流氓政治团伙，要坚决打掉。
    第四，对煽动和制造动乱的极少数人，必须坚决予以揭露。
    第五，全市广大共产党员、共青团员和人民群众，要紧紧团结在党中央周围，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，旗帜鲜明地反对动乱，制止动乱，严守法纪，努力搞好生产和工作，在各自的岗位上为制止动乱和稳定局势做出贡献。
