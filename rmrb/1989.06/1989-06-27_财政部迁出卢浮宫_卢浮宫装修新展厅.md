The Ministry of Finance, which had been temporarily using the Louvre for office space for 118 years, has now completely moved out. The north wing of the Louvre will see an addition of 60,000 square meters of new exhibition space.

Constructed between the 12th and 18th centuries, the Louvre is one of the world's largest art museums, housing 400,000 artifacts. However, the current 70,000 square meters of exhibition space is insufficient, leading to many treasures being displayed on a rotating basis. For instance, out of the 15,000 oil paintings in the collection, only one-fifth are on display at any given time.

In 1981, after François Mitterrand took office as the President of France, he proposed during his first press conference that the Ministry of Finance should relocate to a more suitable location to build a new office building.

The new location for the Ministry of Finance is on Rue de Bercy in the 12th arrondissement of Paris. The new office building, covering 150,000 square meters, is a modern glass and steel structure with sophisticated internal facilities. For example, the automated document and mail delivery system has tracks stretching 6 kilometers, allowing documents and mail to be directly sent from one office to another.

The new building on Rue de Bercy will house 6,000 employees from four ministries, including the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Foreign Trade. The public generally believes that although the construction of the new building and the relocation cost 3.5 billion francs, the entire Louvre expansion and renovation project, which will be completed in three years, will increase the exhibition space to 150,000 square meters. This will make the world-renowned art treasure house truly live up to its name, making the expenditure worthwhile.

### 财政部迁出卢浮宫  卢浮宫装修新展厅

　　财政部迁出卢浮宫  卢浮宫装修新展厅
    本报巴黎６月２７日电  记者吕网大报道：法国财政部“暂借”卢浮宫办公１１８年后，最近全部迁出，卢浮宫北翼将新增展厅面积６万平方米。
    建于公元１２—１８世纪的卢浮宫是世界上最大的美术博物馆之一，共有展品４０万件，但现有的７万多平方米展厅远不够使用，许多珍品只得轮流展出。如收藏的１．５万幅油画，只能展出其中的１／５。
    １９８１年密特朗就任法国总统后，在他举行的第一次新闻发布会上就提出请财政部搬家，另找一个合适的地点盖新办公楼。
    财政部新址位于巴黎东部１２区的贝尔西街，办公楼面积１５万平方米，是一幢现代化的玻璃钢建筑，内部设施也十分讲究，如自动化资料输送系统轨道长６公里，能将文件信件直接从一个办公室传送到另一个办公室。
    在贝尔西街新楼办公的有财政部、外贸部等４个部的６０００工作人员。广大群众认为，虽然建造新楼和搬迁工作耗资３５亿法郎，但３年后整个卢浮宫扩建修复工程结束时，展厅面积将增加到１５万平方米，使这座世界闻名的艺术宝库将更名副其实，所以值得。
