Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 15th.

In recent days, the Party Committees of Jiangxi, Shanxi, Jiangsu, Hebei, Shaanxi, Inner Mongolia, Anhui, and Beijing provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government have respectively convened expanded meetings of the Standing Committee and meetings of provincial-level department heads to seriously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech delivered on June 9th during his reception of military officers at the rank of general and above from the capital's martial law troops. They unanimously expressed their full support and vowed to deeply study, thoroughly understand, and resolutely implement the speech.

They believe, through their study, that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech is a powerful ideological weapon for thoroughly suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital and stabilizing the national situation. It has extremely important significance for unifying the thoughts of the entire Party and the people of the nation. The speech deeply expounds on the correctness of the line, principles, and policies formulated by our Party since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, reaffirms the grand goal and development strategy of modernization construction, and reaffirms the "one center, two basic points" summarized by the Thirteenth National Congress. This has particularly important guiding significance for China's current and future reforms and construction.

They expressed in their study and discussion that they would fully and deeply understand the essence of the speech. Everyone believes that they should use the spirit of this important speech by Comrade Xiaoping to unify their thoughts, recognize the nature of this struggle, correctly understand the series of decisions made by the Party Central Committee in this struggle, and clarify the direction of future work. They must continue to stabilize the situation and contribute to the thorough suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital with practical actions.

They pointed out that the study and implementation of Comrade Xiaoping's important speech should continue to firmly implement the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, eliminate various doubts, and more firmly implement the "one center, two basic points." They should use the Four Cardinal Principles to educate the people, students, all cadres, and Communist Party members, consciously resist bourgeois liberalization, oppose spiritual pollution, and firmly follow the socialist path under the Party's leadership. At the same time, they should more practically grasp the reform and opening up and modernization construction.
