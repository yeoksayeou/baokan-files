Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 8th.

Hong Kong resident Li Zheren, who was involved in illegal activities, has been educated by the public security authorities and has since left Beijing and returned to Hong Kong. During the martial law period in some parts of Beijing, Li arrived from Hong Kong on May 31 and stayed at the Beijing Hotel, Room 505. That same evening, he contacted the "Beijing Students Autonomous Federation," the "Beijing Autonomous Federation of Overseas Students," and the "Square Command Center" and other illegal organizations at Tiananmen Square. After the counter-revolutionary riot on June 3, Li hurriedly left the Beijing Hotel on June 4 and prepared to fly back to Hong Kong on June 5. At 7:45 AM, 79,999 yuan in Chinese currency and propaganda materials inciting the student movement, along with multiple name cards containing false information such as "Hong Kong students Chen Qinghua (male) and Li Lanju (female) have been arrested," and a note reading "Hong Kong Citizens' Support Group for the Patriotic Democratic Movement, Li Zheren," were found discarded in the restroom on the fifth floor of the Beijing Hotel. The public security authorities, in order to clarify the situation, talked to Li at the capital airport on the evening of June 5. Li believed that the money and items might have been discarded by other individuals from Hong Kong. Li claimed to be the general secretary of the Hong Kong Garment Workers' Union and stated that his purpose for coming to Beijing was to find the "Beijing Students Autonomous Federation," the "Beijing Autonomous Federation of Overseas Students," and the "Square Command Center" to provide assistance. After the government announced the occurrence of the counter-revolutionary riot on June 3, he ceased his activities. He confirmed that Chen Qinghua and Li Lanju had already left Beijing and returned to Hong Kong. After receiving education from the public security authorities, he admitted that it was wrong to contact these counter-revolutionary conspiratorial riot illegal organizations during the martial law period and to prepare to provide economic assistance. The public security authorities have temporarily seized the funds he carried and have allowed him to leave Beijing and return to Hong Kong.

　　李卓人承认接触非法组织
    经公安机关教育后已离京返港
    新华社北京６月８日电  香港居民李卓人涉嫌，经公安机关谈话教育后已离京返港。李卓人在北京部分地区戒严期间，于５月３１日自港来京，住在北京饭店西五楼，当晚即与在天安门广场的“市高联”、“外高联”、“广场指挥部”等非法组织联系。６月３日发生反革命暴乱后，李在６月４日匆忙离开北京饭店，５日准备登机返港。７时４５分，在北京饭店西五楼厕所内发现被扔掉的人民币７９９９９元及鼓动学潮的宣传品和写有通知海外记者造谣“香港学生陈清华（男）、李兰菊（女）已被捕”等字样的多张名片，还有“香港市民支援爱国民主运动联合会李卓人”的字条一张。公安部门为查明情况，于６月５日晚在首都机场找到李卓人谈话了解。李认为上述钱物可能是香港来京其他人士扔的。李自称是香港成衣工会总干事，来京目的是找北京的“市高联”、“外高联”、“广场指挥部”，准备提供援助。６月３日政府宣布发生了反革命暴乱之后，他即停止了活动。他证实陈清华、李兰菊已离京返港。他在接受公安机关教育后，承认在戒严期间与这些反革命阴谋暴乱的非法组织接触并准备进行经济援助是错误的。公安部门对其所带款项暂予扣留，已让其离京返港。
