International scheduled flights have seen an improvement in safety levels. According to statistics from the International Civil Aviation Organization, the number of people who died in commercial aviation accidents in 1988 was 1,182, an increase of 9.1% from 1,083 in 1987. Among these, there were 27 scheduled flight accidents resulting in 735 deaths (compared to 26 accidents and 901 deaths the previous year), 21 non-scheduled flight accidents resulting in 178 deaths (compared to 11 accidents and 47 deaths the previous year), and 5 incidents caused by terrorist activities resulting in 269 deaths (compared to 4 incidents and 135 deaths the previous year).

Although the number of fatalities in aviation accidents has increased, the safety level of scheduled flights has improved. The number of passenger deaths per billion kilometers flown decreased from 0.06 in 1987 to 0.04 in 1988.
