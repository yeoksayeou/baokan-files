From the experiments conducted, it has been observed that placing a steel spring as tall as a human between two bases can generate a buffering force capable of balancing the seismic movements that can reach several tens of centimeters during an earthquake. West Germany is currently completing two earthquake-resistant buildings in France. The opera house in Montpellier should not produce discordant sounds due to the rumbling of high-speed trains passing by, so it should be built on a soft foundation. The measuring instruments ordered for this building are highly sensitive, and any passing truck can cause it to lose balance.

Rubber producers are also considering earthquake-resistant construction. They believe that a rubber block of one cubic meter in size can fully absorb the shaking and movement of the ground during a major earthquake. In New York, the Hamburg Rubber Products Company is researching another method using ball bearings to support buildings. They place steel balls between two rubber discs, and after any level of earthquake, the building above the rubber discs will automatically re-center. "It's like squeezing a tennis ball between two saucers."

Meanwhile, statics experts and structural engineers believe that there are effective ways to deal with earthquakes. Numerous experiments conducted in earthquake-prone regions like California and Japan have shown that reinforced concrete is effective. The advantage of modern reinforced concrete buildings is that they can initially follow the shaking. However, "reinforced concrete can also undergo plastic deformation and will not simply shatter like glass when it exceeds its elastic limit."

Professor Ekhard Reihl of the University of Bochum-Ruhr is convinced that "with the current level of technology, it is entirely possible to build earthquake-resistant buildings." He and a colleague have forcefully demonstrated that wrapping a building with corrugated steel sheets (as is commonly done with industrial buildings today) can withstand earthquakes. However, this only applies to buildings supported by a framework of steel and concrete. The friction between this framework and the steel shell can significantly slow down the movement caused by the earthquake. Excess force will be consumed by the building's shell and converted into heat.

　　防震新法研究
    从已作的试验看，把人体那么高的钢簧放在两个基座之间而产生的缓冲力量，可以平衡地震时出现的幅度达几十厘米的运动。西德正在法国完成两个防震建筑。蒙彼利埃的歌剧院不应由于超高速火车的隆隆驶过而产生不和谐音，所以它应当座落在柔软的基地上，为这所建筑订购的测量仪十分敏感，任何一辆驶近的大卡车都会使它失去平衡。
    橡胶生产者也在思考防震建筑。他们认为，一立方米大小的橡胶块完全能缓和大地震的晃动和地皮的移动。在纽约—汉堡橡胶制品公司研究了另外一种用滚珠支撑房子的办法。他们把钢珠夹在两个橡胶盘中间，在任何级地震发生后，橡胶盘上面的建筑物都会自动地重新定中心。“这就像把一个网球夹紧在两个茶碟之间。”
    同时，静力学家和建筑工程师认为，完全有办法对付地震。加利福尼亚和日本多震地区的地震所作的许多次试验表明，用钢筋水泥是有效果的。现代的钢筋混凝土楼房的优点是，它们起初可以随着晃动。但“钢筋水泥也可作可塑的变形，在超过弹性限度时不会简单地像玻璃一样碎裂”。
    波鸿鲁尔大学的教授埃克哈德·赖尔深信，“在目前的技术水平下，完全能建造不怕地震的房子。”他跟一位同事一起有力地证明，用波纹白铁皮似的钢板把建筑物简单地包起来（现在的工业建筑物通常是这样的）就能经受住地震。但这只适用于钢筋和水泥骨架支撑的房子。这种骨架同钢质外壳的摩擦可以大大减缓地震引起的运动。多余的力会消耗建筑物的外壳并把它变为热量。
