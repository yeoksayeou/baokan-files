Since the beginning of last year until this April, Shandong Province, Shenyang City, and Shanghai City have consecutively held trade fairs in Abidjan. There were more than fifty participating companies, and the number of visitors reached tens of thousands. Some focused on exhibitions, while others focused on sales, but regardless of the approach, all achieved relatively good results. Chinese products have begun to enter the homes of many people in Côte d'Ivoire.

"We really don't understand this market," "I didn't know Africa had such a bustling city," "We brought too few items, it would be better to bring more mid-to-high-end products," many of the exhibitors said to the reporter. Several trade fairs allowed more Chinese products to directly meet consumers, providing Chinese companies with the opportunity to understand the African market. At the same time, it also allowed Chinese companies to conduct on-site investigations into the possibility of importing Côte d'Ivoire products to expand trade between the two countries.

At these trade fairs, Chinese apparel, silk, handicrafts, towels, slippers, sports shoes, carpets, bicycles, tea, soccer balls, wigs, bed sheets, daily-use enamelware, and stainless steel utensils were popular and in short supply. At a recent Shanghai Export Commodities Fair, a batch of tractors and fourteen-inch Golden Star brand color TVs were also sold, marking the first time Chinese agricultural machinery and home appliances entered the Côte d'Ivoire market.

Several trade fairs have provided the following insights:

Conducting thorough market research is key to successfully organizing a trade fair. When holding exhibitions in Africa, one must consider the characteristics of Africa and cater to the needs of Africans. For example, Africans love playing soccer, but one time the exhibition featured mostly basketballs and volleyballs. Africans often go barefoot from a young age, and their feet are generally large, so large-sized shoes sold out quickly, while medium and small sizes were left unsold. Africans prefer colorful shirts and blue carpets. Abidjan is a city with a relatively high level of modernization, but the exhibitions organized by China featured mostly mass-market goods, with few mid-to-high-end products, failing to meet the needs of high-income individuals.

Sending capable personnel is a guarantee for successfully organizing a trade fair. Observing the situation of several exhibitions, many companies sent personnel who were knowledgeable in their field, fluent in foreign languages, and capable of handling the work at the exhibition. However, some companies sent personnel with poor business skills, who did not speak foreign languages and lacked knowledge of foreign trade. A deputy leader of an exhibition team told the reporter, "If all of us knew foreign languages, we could do more business."

Choosing the right time for the exhibition can increase its effectiveness. When Shenyang City held an exhibition here in January, many customers said they loved Chinese products, but because there were too many holidays in December last year, they had spent all their money and could only admire the goods. Based on the local situation, if the focus is on sales, it is best to hold the exhibition at the end of November or the beginning of December; if the focus is on exhibitions, March to April is more suitable, as merchants prefer to place orders during this time.

Setting prices once and sticking to them can maintain the reputation of Chinese products. Prices should be set in reference to local prices for similar products, and once the price tags are attached, they should not be changed during the exhibition. At one exhibition, prices were changed arbitrarily, which upset the customers. Near the end of the exhibition, the remaining goods were all discounted, giving the impression of a clearance sale and damaging the reputation of Chinese products. At the Shanghai exhibition, prices remained consistent from beginning to end, and all products were sold, leaving a good impression among the customers.

People in Côte d'Ivoire welcome Chinese products, and there is still great potential for developing trade with Côte d'Ivoire and even the rest of Africa. Whether we can do better depends on our companies.

### 几次商展的启示

　　几次商展的启示
    本报记者  杨汝生
    自去年年初至今年四月，我国的山东省、沈阳市和上海市接连在阿比让举办了商展。参展公司共有五十余个，观众达十几万人。有的以展为主，有的以销为主，但不管哪种，都达到了较好的效果。中国商品已开始走进科特迪瓦的千家万户。
    “我们太不了解这个市场了”，“真不知非洲还有如此繁华的城市”，“带来的东西太少了，多带些中高档的商品就好了”，不少参展的同志这样对记者说。几次商展，使更多的中国产品与消费者直接见面，给中国公司提供了认识非洲市场的机会；同时也使中国公司实地考察了进口科特迪瓦产品的可能性，以扩大两国之间的贸易往来。
    在这几次展销会上，中国服装、丝绸、工艺品、抽纱、浴巾、布鞋、运动鞋、地毯、自行车、茶叶、足球、假发丝、床单、日用搪瓷和不锈钢器皿等价格看好，供不应求。在不久前举办的上海出口商品展销会上，还成交了一批拖拉机和十四英寸金星牌彩电，这是中国农机和家电首次进入科特迪瓦市场。
    几次展销给人的启示是：
    搞好市场调查，是办好商展的关键。在非洲举办展销会，一定要考虑非洲的特点，适应非洲人的需求。如非洲人都喜欢踢足球，而有一次商展摆出来的多是篮球和排球。非洲人从小爱打赤脚，普遍脚大，大号鞋子很快售完，中小号鞋子无人问津。非洲人衬衣爱花色，地毯喜蓝色。阿比让是个现代化水平较高的城市，而我国办的几次展销都是大众化商品多，中高档商品少，未能满足收入高的人的要求。
    选派精干的人员，是办好商展的保证。纵观几次展销会的情况，不少公司派出的人员懂业务、会外语、能胜任展销会的工作。但也有一些公司的派出人员业务素质较差，不会讲外语，缺乏外贸常识。一位展团的副团长对记者说：“若是我们来的人都懂外语，买卖就做大了”。
    展销时间选择得当，可增加商展的效益。沈阳市今年一月在此举办展销时，许多顾客都说，他们非常喜欢中国商品，但因去年十二月份节日太多，钱花光了，现在只能望物兴叹。根据此地情况，若是以销为主，最好在十一月底或十二月初举办；若是以展为主，以三月至四月为宜，因商人多爱在这时订货。
    一次性定价，以保中国商品的信誉。商品定价要参照当地同类商品的价格，一旦贴上标签后，展销期间切莫更改。在一次展销会上，商品价格随便更改，顾客很有意见。临近闭馆时又将剩余商品普遍削价，给人一种大甩卖的感觉，有损中国商品的信誉。上海举办的展销会上，价格从始至终保持一致，商品不但全部售出，在顾客中亦留下较好印象。
    科特迪瓦人欢迎中国商品，发展对科特迪瓦乃至对非贸易仍有很大的潜力。能否搞得更好，这就要看我们的公司了。
