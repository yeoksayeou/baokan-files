I am a college teacher. A few days ago, I listened to the "Voice of America" broadcast, and I felt very indignant. "Voice of America" disregarded journalistic ethics and fabricated all kinds of lies to deceive the public who do not know the truth. In particular, it spread the rumor that "the military used machine guns to kill more than 3,000 people on the square and ran over many people with tanks." As an eyewitness, I was on Tiananmen Square throughout the night of June 3. The People's Liberation Army did not fire at the crowd during the entire clearing process. Around 4:00 AM on June 4, Hou Dejian and a few others made contact with the military personnel. The military agreed to let them leave the square. After Hou Dejian and the others returned, the students on the scene voted on whether to withdraw. Those who agreed to withdraw shouted "withdraw," and those who disagreed shouted "persist." Whichever side had the louder voice, their opinion would be followed. In the end, the call to withdraw prevailed. Finally, the students on the scene, carrying flags, withdrew in an orderly manner from the southeast corner.

As a teacher, I do not want innocent students to be used as tools to achieve someone else's goals, especially taking advantage of students' purity and enthusiasm, which is even more despicable. I also do not want the situation to deteriorate further. I hope that the problem can be resolved rationally and calmly. However, the irresponsible lies of "Voice of America" will only incite greater confrontation and hatred. I do not know what their intentions are? I believe that every person who hopes for social stability and cares about the future of the motherland will not tolerate such deception. The facts will expose their lies.

　　“美国之音”造谣可耻
    一个６月４日凌晨天安门广场目击者的来信
    我是一名高校的教师。前几天听了“美国之音”的广播，我感到非常气愤。“美国之音”不顾新闻职业道德，制造了种种谎言，去欺骗不明真相的群众。特别是制造了“军队在广场上用机枪打死３０００多人，还用坦克车来回轧死许多人的谣言。作为一名目击者，６月３日夜，我一直在天安门广场，解放军在整个清场过程中，从未向广场上的人群开枪。６月４日凌晨４时左右，侯德健等几人与部队的同志进行了接触，部队同意他们撤出广场。侯德健等回来以后，在场的学生就是否撤离进行了表决，同意撤的喊“撤离”，不同意的喊“坚持”，谁的声音大，就按谁的意见办。结果，主张撤离的呼声占了上风。最后，在场的学生打着旗帜有组织地从东南角缓缓撤出。
    作为一名教师，我不希望无辜的学生被人利用作为实现自己目的的工具，特别是利用学生的单纯和热情就更可恶。我也不希望局势更加恶化，我希望能在理智、冷静的条件下妥善地解决问题。而“美国之音”的不负责任的谎言，只会煽起更大的对抗和仇恨，我不知道他们到底是什么居心？我相信每一位希望社会安宁、关心祖国前途的人都不会容忍这种欺骗，事实将会揭穿他们的谎言。
