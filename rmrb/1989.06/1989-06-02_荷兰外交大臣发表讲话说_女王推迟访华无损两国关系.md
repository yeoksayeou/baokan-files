Dutch Foreign Minister says Queen's delay in visiting China will not harm bilateral relations

BRUSSELS, June 1 (Xinhua) -- The Hague: Dutch Foreign Minister Hans van den Broek recently stated that the postponement of Queen Beatrix's state visit to China will not damage the relationship between the two countries.

The Dutch Foreign Ministry announced the postponement of the visit, which was originally scheduled for May 24, just four days before it was to take place.

On May 22, van den Broek told reporters that he had written a letter to the Chinese Foreign Minister to express his regrets over the postponement.

He said he is ready to discuss a new date for the visit with the Chinese side once the situation in China permits.
