Han City, June 6th. (Xinhua News Agency) — South Korean opposition leader Kim Dae-jung, chairman of the Peace Democratic Party, stated at a press conference in Jeonju on June 4th that if the government does not address the Gwangju issue and the legacy of the Fifth Republic, the Peace Democratic Party will not compromise with the regime. He emphasized that this is a matter of life and death for the Peace Democratic Party.

Kim Dae-jung said that the government must resolve the legacy of the Fifth Republic this year. Before advocating for the overthrow of the current government, the Peace Democratic Party will first reach an agreement with the other three parties and adopt a normal political attitude, such as engaging in dialogue with the government.

Kim Dae-jung once again urged President Roh Tae-woo to make a decision to address the Gwangju incident, the legacy of the Fifth Republic, and the issue of social democratization.

    金大中说，今年当局必需解决清算第五共和国时期问题。平民党在提出打倒现政权宣言之前，将首先同其它３个政党达成协议，采取同政府对话等政治性的正常态度。
    金大中再次敦促卢泰愚总统下决心，解决光州事件及第五共和国时期问题和社会民主化问题。
