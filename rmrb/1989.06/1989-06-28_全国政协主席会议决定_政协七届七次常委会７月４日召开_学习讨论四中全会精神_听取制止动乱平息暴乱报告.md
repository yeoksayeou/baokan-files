The National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference held its 19th Chairman's Meeting this morning in Zhongnanhai. The meeting decided to hold the seventh plenary session of the seventh National Committee on July 4th to study and discuss the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and to hear reports on stopping turmoil and suppressing counter-revolutionary riots.

Li Xiannian, Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, attended the meeting and spoke. Wang Renrong, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, presided over the meeting.

All attendees unanimously supported the spirit and decisions of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee.

Li Xiannian said, "This time, we have suppressed the counter-revolutionary riots. Some countries have pressured us. Domestically, some people blindly worship everything from the West. In reality, they want to bring capitalism to China and make China a puppet of certain foreign countries. A few people who insist on bourgeois liberalization are typical examples of this. Comrade Zhao Ziyang actually supported them. In fact, capitalism accumulates capital through exploiting the people and plundering colonies. We are a socialist country and absolutely cannot do that. History does not allow us to do that. Although our country is not yet developed, we must have the spirit and determination to emphasize patriotism, self-reliance, and hard work, and we cannot abandon these traditions."

Li Xiannian pointed out that we will continue to pursue an independent and peaceful foreign policy, develop friendly relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and conduct economic and cultural exchanges. The CPPCC organization should continue to promote people's diplomacy. As long as we adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles and continue with reform and opening up, we will definitely be able to advance our science and technology and industrial and agricultural production, and build a powerful socialist country.

Li Xiannian said that although the student movement was exploited by a few people with ulterior motives, there were also some mistakes in our work, such as the "official profiteering" and corruption issues, which we need to take effective measures to solve in a practical manner to win the trust of the people.

Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Fang Yi, Qu Wu, Qian Weichang, Sun Xiaocun, Sima Yiming Aimaidi, Hou Jianru, also spoke at the meeting. In their speeches, they unanimously agreed with Chairman Li Xiannian's speech and shared their own experiences in studying the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee.

Attending the meeting were also Vice Chairmen of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference, Yan Mingfu, Gu Mu, Yang Jingren, Kang Keqing, Ma Wenrui, Hu Qiaomu, Cheng Siyuan, Qian Zhengying.

　　全国政协主席会议决定    
    政协七届七次常委会７月４日召开     
    学习讨论四中全会精神　听取制止动乱平息暴乱报告
    新华社北京６月２８日电  政协全国委员会今天上午在中南海召开第１９次主席会议。会议决定：７月４日举行全国政协七届七次常委会，学习、讨论党的十三届四中全会精神，听取关于制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的报告。
    全国政协主席李先念出席会议并讲了话，全国政协副主席王任重主持会议。
    与会同志一致拥护党的十三届四中全会精神和各项决定。
    李先念说，这次我们平息反革命暴乱，一些国家压我们。在国内，有些人对西方的一切都盲目崇拜，实际上，是要在中国搞资本主义，使中国成为某些外国的附庸。极少数坚持资产阶级自由化的人就是这样的典型。赵紫阳同志实际上是支持他们的。其实，资本主义是靠剥削人民，掠夺殖民地等手段积累资本的。我们是社会主义国家，绝对不能那样干，历史也不允许那样干。我国尽管现在还不发达，但我们要有志气，要有种精神，要强调爱国主义，自力更生，艰苦奋斗的传统不能丢。
    李先念指出，我们将继续奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，在和平共处五项原则基础上同世界各国发展友好关系，进行经济、文化交流。政协组织要继续开展人民外交。只要我们坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，就一定能把我们的科学技术和工农业生产搞上去，建设一个强大的社会主义国家。
    李先念说，这次学潮虽然被极少数别有用心的人利用了，但我们的工作中也确有一些失误，像“官倒”、腐败现象等问题，都需要我们采取有力措施，扎扎实实地加以解决，以取信于民。
    全国政协副主席方毅、屈武、钱伟长、孙晓村、司马义·艾买提、侯镜如等也在会上讲了话，他们在讲话中一致同意李先念主席的讲话，并畅谈了各自学习中共十三届四中全会精神的体会。
    出席会议的还有全国政协副主席阎明复、谷牧、杨静仁、康克清、马文瑞、胡绳、程思远、钱正英。
