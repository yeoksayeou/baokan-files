The Parthenon is located at the highest point of the Acropolis in Athens and was built between 447 and 438 BC. It is renowned as the crown jewel of ancient architecture and attracts millions of visitors from around the world each year.

However, over the course of more than 2,000 years, the Parthenon has weathered many storms. It has been converted into a Christian church and an Islamic mosque. In 1687, explosives stored inside the temple were detonated, causing the roof and walls to collapse. In the early 19th century, the British Lord Elgin removed a large number of the temple's sculptures to Britain, leaving the structure in ruins.

Now, the Greek government plans to restore this historic building. A team of experts led by 39-year-old architect Manolis Korres has developed a detailed plan, which has been approved by the Committee for the Preservation of the Acropolis Monuments. From March 31 to April 2, over 300 Greek and foreign experts gathered in Athens for an international conference on the restoration of the Acropolis to discuss the restoration plan.

The Korres team's restoration plan includes the following main points: returning the thousands of tons of marble fragments that have been collected from the front of the temple to their original positions, and filling in the gaps with new marble of the same texture. The severely damaged south side of the temple will not be restored for now. The interior will also be appropriately restored, removing some iron rivets to restore the original structure and position.

Once this project is completed, visitors will be able to better appreciate the grandeur of this ancient architectural masterpiece.

    巴特农神庙将“整容”
    ●杨广胜
    巴特农神庙位于雅典卫城最高处，建于公元前447年至前438年，被誉为世界古代建筑的王冠，每年吸引着世界各地数百万游客。
    但是在2000多年的久远岁月里，巴特农神庙历尽沧桑，曾被改为基督教教堂和伊斯兰教寺院。特别是1687年，堆放在殿内的炸药被引爆，使顶部和围墙倒塌。19世纪初，英国人艾尔金又把神庙的大量浮雕运往英国，使这座建筑成了颓垣断壁。
    现在希腊政府计划修复这一历史建筑。以39岁的建筑师马诺里斯·科雷斯为首的专家小组已制订出详细方案，并获得保护雅典卫城古迹委员会的批准。今年3月31日至4月2日在雅典召开了300多希腊及外国专家参加的修复卫城国际会议讨论了修复方案。
    科雷斯小组的修复方案主要有：把已搜集到的从大殿前殿剥落的上千吨大理石碎片复归原处，空隙处用新的质地纹理相同的大理石填补。破坏较为严重的大殿南侧暂不修复。内殿也适当修复，去掉一些铁铆钉，恢复原来的结构和位置。
    这项计划完工后，参观者将能更好地领略这座古代建筑的壮丽雄姿。
