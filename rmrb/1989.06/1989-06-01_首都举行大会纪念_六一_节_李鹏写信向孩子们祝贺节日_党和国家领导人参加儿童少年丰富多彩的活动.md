Dear children, little friends:

On the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the International Children's Day, I am very happy to, on behalf of the grandfathers, grandmothers, uncles, aunts, and other comrades working in Zhongnanhai, extend my greetings to you and wish you a happy holiday!

Little friends, our socialist motherland is advancing along the path of reform and opening up pioneered by Comrade Deng Xiaoping, striving for the Four Modernizations. The tasks are arduous, and the difficulties are not few, but I am confident that the future is bright. You are the flowers of our motherland now. I hope that you can grow up healthily in a better environment and become strong trees, contributing to the construction of our motherland in the future. The childhood and youth period is the time for little friends to grow physically and intellectually. I believe that everyone will surely study diligently, train hard, cultivate good moral character of loving the motherland, the people, science, labor, and protecting public property, and become a new generation with ideals, morality, culture, and discipline. You should always be ready to contribute your strength to create an even more beautiful future for our great socialist motherland.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 1st: (Reporter Wang Ruo) Yan Mingfu, Xi Zhongxun, Liao Hansheng, Chen Xitong, and other comrades came to Beijing Amusement Park today, celebrating the International Children's Day with over 20,000 children from the capital.

The Longtan Lake-side Beijing Amusement Park was filled with festive atmosphere today. Various amusement facilities were crowded with children who were in high spirits.

Chen Xitong, on behalf of the Beijing Municipal Party Committee and the municipal government, wished all the children, young people, and Young Pioneers in the city a happy holiday and expressed respect to their teachers, parents, and people from all walks of life who care for them.

Chen Xitong said, to celebrate the International Children's Day, our Young Pioneers and children all wanted to go to Tiananmen Square to commemorate the martyrs and express their high respect to the people's heroes. The Young Pioneers Union had made an appeal to the people occupying the square, but it did not receive a response. I regret this. Tiananmen Square is the square of the whole nation, and it is also the square of the children of the whole nation. We will definitely fulfill their wishes in a short period of time, allowing the children to hold meaningful activities on Tiananmen Square.

During the gala, the children representatives presented red scarves to the leaders. Afterwards, the leaders inspected the Beijing City Honor Guard of the Chinese Young Pioneers and watched the performances by the children together with them.
