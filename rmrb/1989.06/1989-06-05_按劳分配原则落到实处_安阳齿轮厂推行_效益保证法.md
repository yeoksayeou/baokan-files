The principle of distribution according to work is truly implemented at Anyang Gear Factory, which promotes the "enterprise efficiency guarantee method." Based on strict and scientific quota management, the factory introduces a distribution mechanism, fundamentally changing the abnormal phenomenon where wages and bonuses increase while workers' production enthusiasm decreases. The workers' labor enthusiasm and production initiative have been continuously high, making the factory's economic benefits increase significantly year by year.

Recently, the Henan Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government held a radio and television conference to summarize and promote the factory's experience across the province.

An Yang Gear Factory has more than 700 employees and is a low-profit enterprise in Henan that produces agricultural machinery parts. By 1980, the factory had accumulated losses of 2.28 million yuan, and the enterprise was on the brink of collapse.

In late 1980, Li Wanchun became the factory director and party committee secretary. To get out of the predicament and revitalize the enterprise, they combined the workers' responsibilities with their value, gradually summarizing and promoting a set of scientific management methods known as the "efficiency guarantee method." This method, centered around the enterprise's optimal benefit goal, is based on scientifically calculating and determining advanced and reasonable "process time quotas" and "process cost quotas." It deepens the control of quota costs from the factory and workshop level to each product, each hour, and each process, with each operator and manager implementing direct on-site control. At the same time, the old eight-level wage system was completely abolished, and based on the different labor intensities and technical complexities of various processes, eight wage content price standards were formulated. A "quota cost wage content time-based piecework wage system" was implemented. If the actual cost of a product exceeds the quota cost, the excess is compensated by the workers' wages; if the actual cost is lower than the quota cost, the surplus is shared between the workers and the factory in a 4:6 ratio.

This "efficiency guarantee method" truly implements the principle of distribution according to work in the distribution system. It puts all 700 employees of An Yang Gear Factory on the same starting line, ensuring equal labor and fair distribution. Each person's income is determined by the quantity, quality, and cost of their work, with no upper limit on high income and no lower limit on low income. Special care is taken for the elderly, the weak, the sick, and the disabled. In this way, although some workers have high technical skills, work overtime, and earn hundreds of yuan per month, while others have poor skills, complete fewer hours, and earn only tens of yuan per month, with wages deducted for not completing quotas, there are no complaints due to the fair and reasonable distribution basis and high transparency. Enthusiasm and creativity are stimulated in mutual competition and comparison, quickly turning into a tremendous material force.

In recent years, the factory has significantly improved labor efficiency. The production of various types of gears and spline shafts has increased from 90,000 units to 630,000 units. The equipment completeness rate has reached 88%, controlling and reducing product costs, with product quality improving year by year. Last year, the first-class product rate reached 90%, the defective rate was less than 1%, and cost indicators such as energy consumption, material consumption, and management expenses were all reduced to the best levels in the industry nationwide.

### 按劳分配原则落到实处  安阳齿轮厂推行“效益保证法”

　　按劳分配原则落到实处
    安阳齿轮厂推行“效益保证法”
    据新华社郑州电  （记者尹道夫、郭献文）河南省安阳齿轮厂推出的“企业效益保证法”，在严密科学的定额管理基础上引入分配机制，使按劳分配原则真正落到实处，从根本上改变了因分配不公引起的工资奖金越发越多而职工生产积极性反而下降的反常现象，职工的劳动热情和生产积极性持续高涨，使这个厂的经济效益连年大幅度增长。
    河南省委、省政府最近召开广播电视大会，向全省总结推广了这个厂的经验。
    安阳齿轮厂有职工７００余人，是河南一家生产农机配件的微利企业。这个厂到１９８０年，累计亏损２２８万元。企业濒临倒闭。
    １９８０年底，李万春担任厂长兼党委书记后，为了摆脱困境，振兴企业，他们将职工的责任与价值相结合，在实践中逐步总结推行了“效益保证法”的一套科学管理方法。这套方法围绕企业最佳效益目标，在科学测算和核定先进合理的：“工序工时定额”和“工序成本定额”的基础上，把定额成本由原来的厂和车间控制深化到每件产品、每个工时、每道工序，由每个操作、经营者实行直接现场控制。同时，彻底打破旧的八级工资制，按不同工序的劳动强度、技术繁简综合出８种工资含量价格标准，实行“定额成本工资含量计时计件工资制”。若产品实际成本超出定额成本，超出部分由工人拿工资补偿；若实际成本低于定额成本，节余部分工人和工厂四六分成。
    这种“效益保证法”，在分配制度上真正落实了按劳分配原则。
    它使安阳齿轮厂７００名职工都被拉到同一起跑线上，平等劳动，公平分配，每个人都全凭自己完成的数量、质量和成本量获取应得报酬，收入再高不封顶，收入再低不保底，对老弱病残者则实行照顾。这样，虽然有的工人技术水平高、加班加点干活，月收入高达三四百元，而有的人技术差，完成工时少，每月只收入几十元，完不成定额工资还要下浮，但由于分配依据公平合理，透明度非常高，大家并无怨言，积极性和创造性反而在相互竞争对比中不断受到刺激，并很快转化为巨大物质力量。
    几年来，这个厂不仅大大提高了劳动效率，全厂生产各种型号的齿轮、花键轴由过去的９万件上升到６３万件，而且设备完好率达到８８％，控制并降低了产品成本，产品质量连年提高。
    去年一等品率达到９０％，废品率不足１％，能耗、物耗、管理费用等成本指标也都降至全国同行业最好水平。
