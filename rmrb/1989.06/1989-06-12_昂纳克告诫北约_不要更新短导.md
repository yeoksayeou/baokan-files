East German leader Honecker warned NATO on June 11 not to upgrade its short-range nuclear weapons. He said that upgrading short-range missiles would be tantamount to starting a new round of the arms race.

According to the DPA, Honecker made these remarks during the completion ceremony of the restoration of the ancient St. Nicholas Church in the northern German Democratic Republic city of Greifswald.

In discussing the international disarmament process, he said that U.S. President Bush's recent disarmament proposals were welcome, but NATO had not found common ground with all of the Warsaw Pact's disarmament proposals.

　　昂纳克告诫北约
    不要更新短导
    新华社柏林６月１１日电  民主德国领导人昂纳克１１日告诫北约不要更新短程核武器。他说，更新短导无异于开始一场新的军备竞赛。
    据德通社报道，昂纳克是在参加民主德国北部格莱夫斯瓦尔德市古老的圣·尼古拉教堂的修复落成仪式时说这番话的。
    他在谈到国际裁军进程时说，美国总统布什最近提出的裁军建议是值得欢迎的，但北约并非在华约所有的裁军建议中都找到了共同语言。
