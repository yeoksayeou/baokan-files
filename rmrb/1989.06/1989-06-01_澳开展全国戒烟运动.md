Xinhua News Agency, Canberra, May 31st.

Australia will launch a nationwide anti-smoking campaign to reduce the smoking rate among young women, announced Neil Blunt, the Minister for Public Affairs and Health, today in Canberra.

Blunt stated that this campaign, with a budget of 1.5 million Australian dollars (approximately 1.1 million US dollars), aims to control the adverse health effects of smoking on Australian women.

He noted that due to the increasing smoking rates among women in many countries, the World Health Organization has designated the theme for this year’s May 31st, the second World No-Tobacco Day, as “Women and Tobacco.” Australia’s unprecedented anti-smoking campaign is a show of support for this global initiative.

　　澳开展全国戒烟运动
    新华社堪培拉５月３１日电  澳大利亚公共事物和卫生部长尼尔·布卢伊特今天在这里宣布，澳大利亚将开展一场全国性戒烟运动以降低年轻妇女吸烟率。
    布卢伊特说，这次耗资１５０万澳元（约１１０万美元）的戒烟运动是为了控制吸烟给澳大利亚妇女健康带来的不利影响。
    他说，由于许多国家妇女吸烟率日益升高，世界卫生组织决定把今年５月３１日——世界第二个无烟日的主题定为“妇女与烟草”。澳大利亚开展这次空前的戒烟运动就是为了表示对世界无烟日的支持。
