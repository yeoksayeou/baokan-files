Minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade Zheng Tuobin today told reporters that during the recent turmoil, the production of most foreign-invested enterprises across the country remained basically normal. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade will, as always, work even more actively and effectively to attract foreign investment.

Zheng Tuobin introduced that in recent times, employees of the foreign economic and trade systems in various places have overcome numerous difficulties, persisted in their work, and ensured the normal operation of various businesses related to China's import and export trade and foreign economic and technological cooperation. Although there were serious difficulties such as a shortage of funds and inflation from January to May this year, the country's exports were basically the same as the same period last year, and imports increased by 14.5% compared to the same period last year. Currently, transportation and other services have returned to normal. Ports such as Shanghai, Dalian, Tianjin, Guangzhou, and Qingdao are busy with loading, unloading, and transportation. Various foreign trade companies and enterprises across the country are also actively expanding their businesses, providing high-quality services, and ensuring the timely, high-quality, and high-quantity fulfillment of contracts to maintain China's foreign trade reputation. He said that actively utilizing foreign capital is a fundamental policy of China, and China's open policy will never change. In recent years, China has been committed to improving the environment, and both the use of foreign loans and the absorption of foreign direct investment have made rapid progress. Unfortunately, due to traffic disruptions, the normal operations of some foreign-invested enterprises have been affected to some extent over the past month. Zheng Tuobin expressed his apologies for this. He emphasized that currently, China's social order, production, and living order have basically returned to normal. The safety of foreigners in China is not a problem. He hopes that foreigners who left during the previous period can return to China as soon as possible to continue their work. Zheng Tuobin stated that the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade will firmly implement the open policy, actively develop extensive economic and trade cooperation and technological exchanges with countries and regions around the world, and do its best to help solve the difficulties encountered by foreign-invested enterprises. The Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade will guarantee the economic and trade activities of foreigners in China in accordance with China's relevant laws and policies. During the previous turmoil, many governments and international organizations of various countries believed in China's open policy, looked to the future, were not misled by rumors, and supported their companies and institutions in actively carrying out various economic and trade exchanges and cooperation with China. Many foreign companies and institutions in China overcame difficulties and stayed at their posts. Zheng Tuobin expressed his admiration and respect for their foresight and high trust in the Chinese government and people.

　　经贸部长郑拓彬强调
    中国将继续积极吸收外资
    新华社北京６月１２日电  经贸部部长郑拓彬今天对记者说，在前一段动乱期间，全国大多数外商投资企业生产基本正常。经贸部将一如既往，更积极更有效地做好吸收外商投资工作。
    郑拓彬介绍说，近一段时间，各地经贸系统的职工克服重重困难，坚持工作，保证了我国进出口贸易和对外经济技术合作各项业务的正常进行。今年１至５月份，虽然出现了资金短缺、通货膨胀等严重困难，但全国出口仍与去年同期基本持平，进口也较去年同期增长１４．５％。目前，全国交通运输等已经恢复正常。上海、大连、天津、广州、青岛等各口岸港口装卸集运工作正在紧张进行。全国各对外贸易公司、企业也正在积极开拓业务，提供优质服务，保证按质、按量、按时履约，以维护我国对外贸易信誉。他说，积极利用外资是我国的一项基本国策，中国对外开放的政策永远不会改变。这些年来，我国致力于改善环境，利用国外贷款和吸收外商直接投资都取得迅速进展。但遗憾的是，由于交通受阻，近一个月来，部分外商投资企业的正常经营受到一定影响。对此，郑拓彬表示歉意。他强调，目前，中国的社会秩序、生产和生活秩序已基本恢复正常。外商在中国的安全没有问题。他希望前一阶段离境的外商能尽快地回中国继续工作。郑拓彬表示，经贸部将坚定不移地贯彻执行对外开放的政策，积极发展同世界各国、各地区广泛的经济贸易合作和技术交流，同时将尽力帮助解决外商投资企业遇到的困难。经贸部将按照我国的有关法律和政策对外商在中国的经贸活动给予保障。在前一段动乱期间，许多国家的政府和国际组织，相信中国的对外开放政策，着眼未来，不为谣言所惑，支持其厂商和机构积极开展对华各项经济贸易交流和合作业务，不少在华外国企业、机构的人员，克服困难，坚守岗位。郑拓彬对他们表现出的远见卓识和对中国政府、人民的高度信任，表示钦佩和敬意。
