The two woodcut prints published here are created by officers and soldiers of the Chengdu Military Region's Logistics Department. The authors, who are on average only thirty years old, have mostly not attended art academies and rely primarily on self-study. Their growth has been valued by the military leadership, and they have received enthusiastic guidance and assistance from the Sichuan Provincial Fine Arts Association and woodcut artists from the Sichuan Academy of Fine Arts. This has helped them express their passionate feelings about military life through the artistic language of woodcut prints. Their works demonstrate significant achievements in terms of life foundation, modeling ability, black-and-white handling, and the use of carving techniques.

The authors of "Footprints of the Soldier" have vividly depicted the tense yet serious military life. Amidst the tension, there is lightness, and within the seriousness, there is liveliness. In their creation, they have infused their works with lyrical colors, making black-and-white woodcuts come alive with new vitality.

　　战士的足迹
    这里刊登的两幅版画是成都军区后勤部干部和战士创作的。这些平均年龄只有三十岁的作者，大都没有进过美术院校，靠自学为主。他们的成长受到部队领导的重视，受到四川省美协、四川美院版画家的热心辅导和帮助，促使他们把对部队炽热的生活感受用版画的艺术语言表达出来。他们的作品，无论是在生活根基、造型能力、黑白处理以及刀功的运用上都显示出较高的成就。
    《战士的足迹》作者们把紧张而严肃的军旅生活表现得丰富多姿。紧张中有轻快，严肃中有活泼。在创作中注入了作者的抒情色彩，黑白木刻在他们手里焕发出新的生机。
