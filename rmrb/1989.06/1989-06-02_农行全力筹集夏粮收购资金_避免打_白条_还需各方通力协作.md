The Agricultural Bank of China (ABC) has been actively raising funds for the summer grain procurement since April by mobilizing deposits and reducing general loans. By mid-May, the bank's savings balance had increased by nearly 9 billion yuan compared to the beginning of the year, an increase of 2.5 billion yuan over the same period last year. Loans to township enterprises had decreased by 450 million yuan compared to the beginning of the year, and by 4.6 billion yuan compared to the same period last year. Deposits with the People's Bank of China reached 11.2 billion yuan, an increase of over 5 billion yuan compared to the beginning of the year, thereby enhancing the bank's payment capacity.

However, during the process of raising procurement funds, the ABC has encountered some problems that it cannot solve on its own. The main difficulties currently faced are as follows: First, some commercial enterprises have severely occupied and misappropriated procurement funds. According to statistics from seven provinces, including Shandong, by mid-May, some commercial enterprises had unreasonably occupied and misappropriated 1.8 billion yuan of procurement funds. Second, the arrears of agricultural product sales revenue are severe. Investigations show that by mid-May, seven provinces, including Zhejiang, had not yet recovered 3.4 billion yuan of agricultural product sales revenue. Third, the turnover of agricultural products is slow. Nationwide, due to slow turnover of agricultural products and other reasons, over 6 billion yuan of loans have been occupied. Fourth, the allocation of subsidies is delayed. According to the commercial sector, by the end of April, relevant departments had not allocated over 5 billion yuan in price subsidies and policy losses for grains and cotton to the commercial sector, an increase of over 2 billion yuan compared to the same period last year. This directly reduces the ABC's sources of procurement funds.

An official from the ABC headquarters told reporters that the bank will continue to do its utmost to support the summer procurement. However, relying solely on the ABC to handle all the procurement funds is not feasible. Therefore, the bank appeals to all relevant departments to, under the unified leadership of governments at all levels, strengthen the management of agricultural product procurement funds, divide responsibilities, and cooperate with each other. At the same time, the bank hopes that the central bank will, in cases where efforts have been made on all fronts but there is still a funding gap, provide timely assistance to resolve the issue. Together, we can ensure the supply of procurement funds, prevent the issuance of "white receipts" during procurement, and alleviate the concerns of farmers.

　　农行全力筹集夏粮收购资金
    避免打“白条”还需各方通力协作
    本报讯  记者江夏报道：记者从主办农副产品收购信贷业务的中国农业银行总行了解到，农行从４月份即开始通过大力组织存款、压缩一般贷款，为筹集收购资金作准备。到５月中旬为止，农行的储蓄余额比年初增加近９０亿元，比去年同期多增加２５亿元；对乡镇企业贷款比年初减少４．５亿元，比去年同期减少４６亿元；在人民银行的存款达１１２亿元，比年初增加５０多亿元，支付能力进一步增强。
    农行在筹集收购资金的过程中遇到一些靠他们自身难以解决的问题，目前面临的主要困难一是部分商业企业挤占、挪用收购资金的情况严重。据对山东等７省的统计，到５月中旬为止，被一些商业企业不合理挤占、挪用的收购资金为１８亿元。二是农副产品销货款拖欠情况严重。调查表明，浙江等７省应收回而未收回的农副产品销货款到５月中旬达３４亿多元。三是农副产品调销缓慢。全国因农副产品调销缓慢等原因多占用贷款６０多亿元。四是应拨补款下达迟。据商业部门反映，到４月底有关部门应补未补商业部门粮棉加价款和政策性亏损５０多亿元，比去年同期增加２０多亿元。直接减少了农行收购资金来源。
    农行总行一位负责同志对记者说，农行将继续全力以赴支持夏季收购，但是收购资金全靠农行一家是包不下来的。因此，吁请各有关部门在各级政府的统一领导下，加强农副产品收购资金管理，分工负责，互相配合。同时希望中央银行在各方面尽了最大努力而资金仍有缺口的情况下，及时帮助通融解决，大家共同努力，确保收购资金供应，杜绝收购打“白条”的现象，解除农民的后顾之忧。
