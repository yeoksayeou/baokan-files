A long-standing and stubborn disease, osteomyelitis, has recently been overcome by Jiao Bo Kui, a traditional Chinese medicine practitioner in Harbin.

Osteomyelitis, also known as tuberculosis of the bones and joints, commonly affects middle-aged and elderly individuals. Those afflicted first experience pain in the bones and joints, followed by the formation of abscesses, which can ultimately lead to limb deformities. Patients endure immense suffering.

After more than a decade of tireless research, Dr. Jiao Bo Kui has finally unraveled the mysteries of osteomyelitis and invented four new medications. Clinical trials on over a thousand patients have shown a cure rate of over ninety percent.
