Westerners have a habit of giving nicknames to the people they like. In the past, they called former U.S. President Ronald Reagan "Ronnie," and now they call Gorbachev "Gorbie." This "Gorbie" has, since taking office as the leader of the world's largest country over four years ago, repeatedly brought about new changes, both internationally and domestically, sometimes leaving people dizzy. Sandwiched between the U.S. and the Soviet Union, West Germany naturally pays extra attention to the movements of this leader. People are not driven by mere curiosity; rather, West Germany has many issues that need to be resolved with the Soviet Union—disarmament, missiles, West Berlin, and so on. Now, "Gorbie" has arrived, and the eyes of West Germany's political circles, media, and ordinary citizens are almost all focused on him.

In recent days, the top headline in West Germany's media has been "Gorbie." Major newspapers have almost all published supplements, with articles spanning dozens of pages, covering everything from the Soviet Union to West Germany-Soviet Union relations, East-West European relations, and more. Nearly 2,000 journalists from over 50 countries have gathered in Bonn. Due to the large number of people, the press center is located in the headquarters of the West German Christian Democratic Union. A reporter inquired and found that the Soviet TASS News Agency alone has sent a team of fifty or sixty people, with many foreign journalists flying in from Moscow. This morning, the reporter went to the presidential palace to cover the welcoming ceremony and had to wait in line for half an hour before finally getting in.

The "Gorbie" delegation arrived at the presidential palace in the city center at 12:30 PM. Countless cameras and video cameras were aimed at him, with shutters clicking non-stop. Latecomers had to aim their cameras over the heads of the front row. Gorbachev wore a dark suit today, looking dashing. On the lawn of the presidential palace, he stopped twice to chat with the welcoming crowd. A Soviet teenager, about fifteen or sixteen years old, told him that they were a group of exchange students from Rostov, Soviet Union, currently studying in a school in Dortmund. The teenager said, "Openness" brought them to West Germany, and Gorbachev smiled in satisfaction. A West German said to Gorbachev that a foundation in Hamburg is training young managers from the Soviet economic sector, and Gorbachev said that such cooperation will only increase. I observed that this welcoming ceremony was much more lively and relaxed than Bush's half a month ago, with nearly twice as many attendees. Outside the presidential palace, many passersby gazed in from behind the fence. As Gorbachev's motorcade passed by, the crowd applauded, and "Gorbie" waved back from the car window.

"Gorbie" has arrived. What new gifts will he bring for West Germany, for German-Soviet relations, and for East-West European relations? We can only wait and see.

　　“戈尔比”来了
    本报记者  江建国
    西方人习惯给他们喜爱的人起个爱称。从前他们称美国前总统罗纳德·里根为“罗尼”，现在他们称戈尔巴乔夫为“戈尔比”。这个“戈尔比”自从４年多以前就任世界上最大的国家的领导人职务以来，无论在国际上还是国内一次又一次地刮起新风，有时简直吹得人们有些晕头转向。夹在美国和苏联之间的西德，对这位领导人的一举一动自然有着分外的关注。人们不是从一般的好奇出发，实在是因为西德有许许多多的问题需要同苏联一起解决，裁军、导弹、西柏林……等等。现在，“戈尔比”来了，西德政界、新闻界和普通老百姓的目光，也就自然而然地差不多全都注视着他了。
    连日来，西德的新闻界头号标题是“戈尔比”。各大报几乎全都出版增刊，篇幅长达十几版，苏联的这个，苏联的那个，西德苏联关系，欧苏关系……真是排山倒海。全世界５０多个国家近２０００名记者云集波恩，因为人太多，新闻中心是借西德基督教民主联盟的总部。记者在那里打听了一下，仅苏联塔斯社一家就派出五六十人的队伍，许多外国记者专程从莫斯科飞来。今天上午，记者到总统府采访欢迎仪式，在门前排了半个钟头的队才好不容易进去了。
    “戈尔比”一行１２时３０分抵达市中心的总统府。数不清的摄影机、摄像机对准了他，快门响个不停。晚到一点的记者只好从后排头顶上把镜头对准他按快门。戈尔巴乔夫今天着深色西服，风度潇洒。在总统府草坪上，他两次停步同欢迎的人们交谈。一个苏联十五六岁的少年告诉他，他们是一组交换的中学生，来自苏联罗斯托夫，现在多特蒙德一个中学学习。这个少年说，“开放性”使他们来到西德，戈尔巴乔夫满意地笑了。一位西德人对戈尔巴乔夫说，他们汉堡的一个基金会正在培训苏联经济界的年轻经理，戈尔巴乔夫说，这种合作会越来越多。我观察了一下，这次欢迎仪式比布什半个月前那次气氛热烈轻松得多，来的人差不多超出一倍。总统府外不少行人隔着栅栏向里面眺望，戈尔巴乔夫的车队经过时，行人向他鼓掌。“戈尔比”隔着车窗招手作答。
    “戈尔比”来了，他将为西德、为德苏关系、为东西欧关系带了什么新的礼物？人们只能拭目以待了。
