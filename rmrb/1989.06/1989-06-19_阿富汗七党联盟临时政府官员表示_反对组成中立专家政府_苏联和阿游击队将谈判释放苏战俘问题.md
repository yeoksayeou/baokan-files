Afghan Seven-Party Alliance Interim Government Officials Oppose Formation of Neutral Expert Government
Soviet Union and Afghan Mujahideen to Negotiate Release of Soviet POWs

ISLAMABAD, June 19 (Xinhua) — Afghan Seven-Party Alliance Interim Government Foreign Minister Gulbuddin said yesterday that the Mujahideen oppose the so-called proposal to "first form a neutral expert government in Afghanistan and then transfer power to the interim government."

Gulbuddin made these remarks yesterday in a speech at the Pakistan Strategic Studies Institute. He said this is not a new proposal; last year, when the Geneva Agreement on the Afghan issue was signed, then UN Special Envoy Diego Cordovez had made a similar suggestion. He pointed out that the key issue is not about changing individual leaders, but the entire system.

Previously, the Prime Minister of the Seven-Party Alliance Interim Government, Rasul Sayyaf, also expressed opposition to the above proposal on June 17, calling it a "delaying tactic." He believed that this proposal is "unfeasible and will not produce results."

Sayyaf said that if this proposal means putting pressure on the Soviet authorities to stop aiding the Kabul regime and helping the Mujahideen government, it would be meaningful; if the purpose of this proposal is to impose a regime on the Afghan people, it will inevitably face resistance from the Mujahideen.

The proposal to establish a neutral expert cabinet in Afghanistan as a transitional institution was made by the Pakistani Foreign Ministry spokesman on June 14.

Xinhua News Agency, Islamabad, June 18 — A Soviet delegation arrived here today to negotiate the release of Soviet prisoners of war with the Afghan Mujahideen.

The delegation includes three mothers of POWs and one father of a POW. Some members of the delegation told reporters upon arrival at the airport that their country's invasion of Afghanistan was a mistake. Although Soviet troops have withdrawn from Afghanistan, the pain of thousands of people still exists.

　　阿富汗七党联盟临时政府官员表示
    反对组成中立专家政府
    苏联和阿游击队将谈判释放苏战俘问题
    本报伊斯兰堡６月１９日电  记者任毓骏报道：阿富汗七党联盟临时政府外交部长古勒布丁昨天说，游击队方面反对所谓“在阿富汗先组成一个中立的专家政府，然后向临时政府移交权力”的建议。
    古勒布丁是昨天在巴基斯坦战略研究所发表演讲时说这番话的。他说，这不是新建议，去年签订关于阿富汗问题的日内瓦协议时，当时的联合国特使科多韦斯就曾提出类似的建议。他指出，问题的关键不在于更换个别领导人，而在于整个制度。
    在此之前，七党联盟临时政府总理拉苏尔·萨亚夫１７日也表示反对上述建议，并称之为“拖延战术”。他认为这一建议“不可行而且不会产生效果”。
    萨亚夫说，如果这个建议意味着向苏联当局施加压力，使它停止对喀布尔政权的援助，并且帮助阿游击队政府，那将是有意义的；如果这个建议的目的是把一个政权强加给阿富汗民族，它将必然受到游击队的抵制。
    在阿富汗成立一个中立的专家内阁作为过渡机构的建议，是巴基斯坦外交部发言人于６月１４日提出来的。
    新华社伊斯兰堡６月１８日电　一苏联代表团今天到达这里，以便同阿富汗游击队谈判释放苏联战俘问题。
    这个代表团里包括３名战俘的母亲和１名战俘的父亲。代表团的一些成员在抵达机场时对记者表示，他们的国家侵略阿富汗是犯了一个错误。虽然苏军已从阿富汗撤走，但是数千人的悲痛仍然存在。
