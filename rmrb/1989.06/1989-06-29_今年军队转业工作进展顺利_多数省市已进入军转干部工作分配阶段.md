The military transfer work progresses smoothly this year

Most provinces and cities have entered the stage of distributing military transfer cadres

Beijing, June 29th, according to information from the Office of the State Council's Military Transfer Cadres Settlement Work Group, by the end of June, 27 provinces and cities across the country have completed 99.8% of their transfer plans. Most provinces and cities have entered the stage of distributing military transfer cadres.

The head of the Office of the State Council's Military Transfer Cadres Settlement Work Group said that nearly 40,000 military cadres will be transferred this year.

The main leaders of the Sichuan Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government actively listened to the report from the provincial military transfer office and promptly deployed this work throughout the province. Currently, Sichuan Province has accepted over 500 transferred cadres in banks, insurance, taxation, and auditing departments, accounting for 20.6% of the total number of transferred cadres in the province this year. In May, Shaanxi Province also carried out a month-long propaganda campaign for military transfer work.

This year, nearly 7,000 division and regiment-level cadres will be transferred, accounting for 17.4% of the total number of transferred cadres this year, the highest in history. To ensure that these cadres find suitable positions and fully utilize their talents, various regions are actively preparing. Tianjin City has prepared 4,000 square meters of housing for fully transferred households in urban areas in advance, and provides a subsidy of 3,000 yuan for each household moving to suburban counties. Heilongjiang, Sichuan, and Hubei provinces have also appropriately increased housing construction subsidies.

　　今年军队转业工作进展顺利     
    多数省市已进入军转干部工作分配阶段
    本报北京６月２９日讯  据来自国务院转业干部安置工作小组办公室的消息，截至６月底，全国２７个省、市的军转工作已完成交接计划的９９．８％，绝大部分省、市已进入转业干部工作分配阶段。
    国务院军队转业干部安置工作小组办公室的负责人介绍说，今年有近４万名军队干部转业。
    四川省委、省政府主要负责同志，主动听取省军转办公室的汇报，并及时在全省部署了这项工作。目前，四川省仅银行、保险、税务、审计等部门就接收转业干部５００余名，占全省今年转业干部总数的２０．６％。陕西省在５月份还开展了军转工作宣传月活动。
    今年师、团职转业干部近７０００名，占今年转业干部人数的１７．４％，是历年最高的。为了使这些干部各得其所、各展所长，各地正抓紧做准备工作。天津市为市区安置的全迁户提前准备了４０００平方米住房，对到郊区县的全迁户，每户给予３０００元的补助。黑龙江、四川、湖北也适当增加了建房补助费。
