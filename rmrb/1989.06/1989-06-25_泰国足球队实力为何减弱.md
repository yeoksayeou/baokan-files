Recently, it has been evident from several international matches that the strength of the Thai football team has declined compared to its past performance. What are the reasons behind this? Recently, the reporter interviewed Mr. Wei Ji, the secretary-general of the Thai Football Association. According to him, the main reason is that some key players and technically proficient members of the Thai football team have been hired away by foreign football teams with high salaries.

The Thai football team consists of A and B teams. In international matches, the A team is the main team, with the B team providing support. Currently, out of the 12 players in the A team, 6 key players have been hired by foreign football teams. Among them, the forward Piyapong has been hired by Malaysia, the midfielder Warawan by Japan, and the defender Nadi by Denmark. The Thai Football Association has repeatedly requested them to return to the country to participate in matches, but due to the competitive salaries offered by foreign football teams, it has been difficult to bring them back.

Given the current situation, the Thai Football Association is supplementing the A team with the B team and selecting outstanding players from various teams across the country to join the national team. Currently, the remaining players from the A team, Basao and Pongtong, are serving as forwards and key players. Although their skills are not on par with Piyapong, they are performing with great effort and are expected to catch up with the veteran Piyapong in about two years. The key players who are currently playing abroad will still be members of the Thai football team. It is estimated that by the end of July this year, they will gradually return and participate in training together, preparing for the Southeast Asian Games to be held in Malaysia from August 20 to 31.

Mr. Wei Ji believes that players participating in foreign teams can learn good techniques and experiences from foreign football teams, enriching themselves and improving the team's skills. For a national team, understanding the situation and techniques of foreign teams is very important. Therefore, the Thai Football Association has been sending teams abroad to participate in matches for over a decade. Through these matches, they have continuously gained new experiences and lessons. He hopes that the football teams of Thailand and China will strengthen their exchanges and matches in the future, learning from each other's strengths and weaknesses, and jointly improving. He praised the Chinese football team's skills and said that if possible, he would like to hire a football coach from China.

　　泰国足球队实力为何减弱
    本报记者  刘爱成
    最近一个时期，人们从一些国际比赛中明显看出，泰国足球队实力不如以前。究竟是什么原因？记者最近访问了泰国足球协会秘书长维集先生。据他介绍，其主要原因是泰国足球队中的部分主力和技术较高的队员都被外国足球队高薪聘走。
    泰国足球队共有Ａ、Ｂ两队。在对外比赛中，以Ａ队为主，Ｂ队作补充。目前Ａ队１２名队员中，有６名主力队员被外国足球队聘用。其中前锋披耶蓬被马来西亚聘走，中场球员瓦拉旺被日本聘走，后卫纳迪在丹麦。泰国足球协会曾多次要求他们回国参加比赛，但由于在报酬方面竞争不过外国足球队，而难以使他们回来。
    鉴于目前这种情况，泰国足球协会一方面用Ｂ队补充Ａ队，另一方面从全国各球队中选拔优秀队员，加入国家队。现在由Ａ队剩下的队员巴硕和蓬通作为前锋和主力。他们虽然技术比不上披耶蓬，但表现很努力，估计两年后能赶上老将披耶蓬。在国外踢球的那些主力选手目前仍是泰国足球队队员。估计到今年７月底，他们将陆续归来，一起参加训练，准备参加今年８月２０日至３１日在马来西亚举行的东南亚运动会。
    维集先生认为，队员参加外国队，也可学到外国足球队好的技术和经验，以充实自己和提高本队的技术。作为一个国家的球队对于了解外国队的情况和技术是十分重要的。为此泰国足球协会早在十几年前就多次派球队出国参加比赛。在交战中，不断获得新的经验教训。他希望泰中两国足球队今后能加强交往和比赛，互相取长补短，共同提高。他称赞中国足球队技艺不错，并说有可能的话，想从中国聘请足球教练。
