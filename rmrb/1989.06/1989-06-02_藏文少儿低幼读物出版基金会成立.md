The Tibetan Children's Picture Book Publishing Foundation was recently established in Beijing. Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, Ngapoi Ngawang Jigme, attended the founding ceremony and delivered a speech. He said, "We must provide our future and hope—the innocent children—with a small book, a bit of knowledge, a bit of science, a bit of method, a bit of wisdom, and a bit of affection. Let them follow the footsteps of science from a young age."

This foundation is a non-profit civilian organization. Its purpose is to connect with international friends, organizations, groups, Tibetan people both domestically and abroad, and relevant domestic groups, organizations, and democratic individuals to raise funds for the publication of Tibetan children's picture books.
