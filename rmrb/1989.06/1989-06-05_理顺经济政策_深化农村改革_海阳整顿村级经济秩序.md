The CPC Haiyang County Committee and the County Government in Shandong Province mobilized over 1,500 cadres from county and township levels to conduct a comprehensive rectification of village-level economic order in April and May. This effort aimed to deepen rural reforms and promote the development of village-level economies, laying a solid foundation for future progress.

Since Haiyang County implemented the household contract responsibility system in 1982, rural economies have seen significant growth. However, the relationship between collective and individual management was not properly handled, leaving village-level economic management in a state of disarray. Many central policies were not effectively implemented at the village level, leading to issues such as incomplete financial teams, unplanned financial expenditures, lack of financial management systems, and chaotic accounting and contracts. By the end of 1988, the county's rural collective debt had reached over 500 million yuan, a 44.6% increase from 1982. Non-productive expenditures, particularly management fees, surged from 8.1 million yuan in 1982 to over 80 million yuan in 1988, marking a ninefold increase.

Recognizing these issues, the county committee and government decided to focus on rectifying rural economic order. They dispatched cadres to villages across the county to unify the understanding of party policies among the masses, thoroughly clean up financial records, and collect overdue payments. Each village reviewed and verified all financial records since 1982, ensuring that accounts, assets, and funds matched, and publicly disclosed the results. Based on this, they settled various overdue payments and unfulfilled grain and oil procurement tasks.

Building on this foundation, they worked to improve contract management and establish regulations. The county standardized contract templates, bringing grain and oil production, sideline industries, diversified operations, orchards, mountains, grain and oil procurement, and supply of production materials under a unified, scientific, and institutional framework. They also revised and adjusted economic development plans, focusing on grain and oil production, diversified operations, fruit industry, sideline industries, and agricultural infrastructure, ensuring that development priorities were clearly defined and non-essential expenditures were curtailed.

Currently, through this rectification, the county's rural areas have streamlined economic policies and strengthened management at all levels, laying a solid groundwork for achieving a bumper harvest this year and ensuring the stable development of the rural economy.

　　理顺经济政策　深化农村改革
    海阳整顿村级经济秩序
    新华社济南６月４日电  据烟台日报社记者侯云友报道：中共山东省海阳县委、县政府从县乡两级抽调了１５００多名机关干部，４至５月份深入全县农村，集中开展治理整顿村一级经济秩序活动，为深化农村改革，促进全县村一级经济的发展，打下了坚实的基础。
    海阳县从１９８２年推行家庭联产承包责任制以后，农村经济获得长足的发展。但是，由于“统”与“分”的关系没有处理好，村一级经济的经营管理却处在“空档”上。中央的许多政策到了村这一级出现了“断层”，导致不少村财会队伍不健全，财务收支无计划，资金管理无制度，乱支乱花，帐目、合同不完善，整个经济活动不能正常开展。到１９８８年底全县农村集体债务达到５００多万元，比１９８２年增长４４．６％；非生产性开支急剧上升，仅管理费一项就由１９８２年的８１万元增加到１９８８年的８００多万元，绝对额增长９倍。
    根据这种情况，县委、县政府认为，必须狠抓农村经济秩序的治理整顿。他们从县乡两级机关抽调干部，分赴全县各乡镇村，用党的政策统一广大农民的认识，扎扎实实地清理财务帐目，收缴各种欠款。各村对１９８２年以来集体的各种财务帐目进行重新清理核实，做到帐帐相符，帐物相符、帐款相符，并公布于众。在清帐的基础上，清交了各种欠款和欠交的粮油定购任务。
    在此基础上，他们认真抓了完善承包合同、健全规章制度的工作。县里统一制定合同样本，把粮油生产，工副业项目，多种经营、果园、山岚、粮油征购以及生产资料供应等方面的合同纳入规范化、科学化、制度化，并重新制定和调整经济发展规划，把粮油生产，多种经营、果业、工副业、农业基本建设等按治理整顿的要求，重新修订，该发展的发展，该压缩的压缩。
    现在，全县农村通过治理整顿，理顺了各项经济政策，加强了各个管理环节，为夺取今年农业丰收，稳定发展农村经济打下了良好基础。
