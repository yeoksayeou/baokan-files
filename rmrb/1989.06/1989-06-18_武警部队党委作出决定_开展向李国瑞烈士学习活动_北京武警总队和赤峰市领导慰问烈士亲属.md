Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 18th.

The People's Armed Police Force Party Committee today decided to launch a campaign for all officers and soldiers of the armed police nationwide to learn from Li Guorui, who sacrificed his life while defending the Party Central Committee, the capital Beijing, and the people during the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

Li Guorui, the martyr, enlisted in November 1987 from Wengniute Banner, Chifeng City, Inner Mongolia. He was a member of the Communist Youth League and served as a soldier in the Communication Platoon of the 1st Company, 2nd Battalion, Beijing Garrison. On the night of June 3, during the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital, he was on duty with his unit when their vehicle was set on fire. While on foot, he was attacked and beaten by rioters and separated from his unit. At around 4 AM on June 4, while searching for his unit near the Fuchengmen Overpass, Li Guorui was brutally beaten and killed by a group of rioters using clubs and shovels. He was only 20 years old.

The decision states that Li Guorui, the martyr, bravely fought to quickly suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, defend the capital, and protect the people. He defended the People's Republic of China, which was established by the blood and sacrifices of millions of revolutionary martyrs, and the achievements of ten years of reform. In extremely difficult and harsh conditions, he demonstrated a revolutionary spirit of bravery and fearlessness, enduring humiliation and fighting to the death, ultimately sacrificing his young life. His heroic actions won the high praise of the people and fully demonstrated the armed police soldiers' loyalty to the Party, the country, and the people. He set a shining example for all officers and soldiers. According to the martyr's wishes and his consistent performance, as well as his spirit and bravery in sacrificing himself for the country and the people, the Political Department of the General Headquarters approved him as a revolutionary martyr and posthumously granted him membership in the Communist Party. To carry on the martyr's will, promote and carry forward the revolutionary heroism of the martyr, and cultivate more heroic and exemplary figures, the Party Committee of the General Headquarters decided: to launch a campaign throughout the armed police force to learn from the revolutionary martyr Li Guorui. All levels of party committees and political organs should closely combine this with the actual situation of their units and start from themselves to quickly and widely launch this campaign.

The decision calls on all officers, soldiers, workers, and families of the armed police force to learn from Li Guorui, the martyr. Learn from his high political awareness of loyalty to the country and the people; learn from his revolutionary spirit of fearlessness in the face of bloodshed and sacrifice, and not being afraid of hardships and difficulties; learn from his heroic spirit of loyalty to duty and fearlessness in the face of violence; learn from his noble character of diligence and wholeheartedly serving the people; learn from his excellent style of strictly observing discipline and obeying orders. Guided by Chairman Deng's important speech during the reception of senior officers of the martial law troops, we will continue to advance, build on our victories, and resolutely carry the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion to the end. We will strive to better maintain social order and normal social order, defend the four cardinal principles, and promote the great cause of construction and reform!

On the afternoon of June 16, leaders from the Beijing Armed Police Force and the Party, government, and military of Chifeng City drove to the hometown of Li Guorui, the martyr—Mao Mountain East Township, Ximaobulao Village, Wengniute Banner, Inner Mongolia—to visit the martyr's family.

Zhang Zicheng, the Political Department Director of the Beijing Armed Police Force, said: "Guorui was our good comrade, a good soldier of the armed police force, and a good young man from our hometown. All officers and soldiers of the Beijing Armed Police Force will take the hero as an example, resolutely and thoroughly suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and use practical actions to comfort the loyal soul of the martyr."

Li Guorui's second elder brother, Li Guocheng, on behalf of the whole family, requested that the martyr's third elder brother, Li Guozhong, be enlisted to serve in the armed police unit where his younger brother served, to contribute to the defense of the great capital Beijing.
