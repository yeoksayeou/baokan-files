Since June 22, the Public Security Bureau Party Group has seriously studied and disseminated the spirit of the Central Political Bureau Enlarged Meeting and the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, and studied Comrade Deng Xiaoping's recent important speeches. They unanimously support the various important decisions made at the Fourth Plenary Session.

Members of the Public Security Bureau Party Group who directly participated in the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital deeply felt that in this serious political struggle, without the far-sighted leadership of Comrade Deng Xiaoping and the other veteran proletarian revolutionaries, the future of our Party and country would have been unthinkable. The veteran proletarian revolutionaries, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at their core, saved the Party and the country at this critical historical juncture. With their support for the decisions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, our public security organs and the People's Armed Police were able to assist the People's Liberation Army in successfully completing the martial law mission and achieving a major victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital.

In recent days, the Public Security Bureau has conveyed the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session to the leaders and cadres of all levels in the bureau and its affiliated units, and issued a notice to all levels of public security organs, requiring all public security personnel to seriously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speeches and the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session, and to link this with the actual work of public security. They should calmly reflect on the past and the future, and seriously study the actual problems facing public security work and the strategies to be adopted. In the current struggle to stop the turmoil and suppress the counter-revolutionary riot, they must strictly act according to law, base themselves on facts, and adhere to legal principles. They must severely crack down on the most heinous counter-revolutionary rioters. At the same time, they must strictly distinguish between two different types of contradictions. For various serious criminals who seriously endanger social order, they must seize the current favorable opportunity to give them a powerful blow. This is to fully implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, ensure the smooth progress of socialist construction and reform, and create a good social security environment.

　　公安部党组在学习四中全会精神时表示    
    创造良好社会治安环境  保障建设改革顺利进行
    本报北京６月２８日讯  ６月２２日以来，公安部党组认真传达学习中央政治局扩大会议和党的十三届四中全会精神，学习邓小平同志最近几次重要讲话，一致拥护四中全会的各项重要决定。
    直接参加平息首都反革命暴乱斗争的公安部党组成员深切地体会到，在这次严重政治斗争中，如果没有邓小平同志为代表的老一辈无产阶级革命家高瞻远瞩，力挽狂澜，我们党和国家的前途命运是不堪设想的。以邓小平同志为代表的老一辈无产阶级革命家在历史的紧要关头，挽救了党，挽救了国家。有他们支持党中央、国务院决策，我们公安机关和武警部队才能协助人民解放军胜利完成戒严任务，取得平息首都反革命暴乱的重大胜利。
    连日来，公安部向部机关和直属单位各级领导干部、广大党员干部传达四中全会精神，向各级公安机关发出通知，要求全体公安干警认真学习邓小平同志重要讲话和四中全会文件，联系公安工作的实际，冷静地思考一下过去和未来，认真研究公安工作面临的实际问题和应采取的对策。在当前制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱的斗争中，要严格依法办事，以事实为根据，以法律为准绳，严厉打击罪大恶极的反革命暴乱分子。同时，严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。对各种严重危害社会治安的严重犯罪分子，要抓住当前有利时机给予有力打击，为全面贯彻落实党的十三届四中全会精神、保障社会主义建设和改革事业的顺利进行，创造良好的社会治安环境。
