	Painful Reflection, Regret, and Hatred – A University Student's Heavy Reflection and Diary Excerpts
	From a Second-Year Student at a Certain Academy

	These past few days, I have been afraid to watch television, yet I can't help but watch. Military vehicles are engulfed in flames, a group of counter-revolutionary rioters are brutally beating soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and especially when I see the remains of the two soldiers who were cruelly killed under the bridge at Chongwenmen and at Xidan, my heart feels like it's being stabbed and burned, and my spirit is almost completely shattered.

	On April 27th, I served as a member of the security team during the march. On May 13th, I started with the support team and later joined the hunger strike. Although I have consistently maintained that we should not use violent resistance and have not thrown a single brick or stone, the harsh reality forces me to admit that our enthusiasm and actions have been exploited. Whether intentionally or unintentionally, we have fanned the flames, turning the turmoil into a counter-revolutionary riot. We were crowned with the titles of "elite" and "vanguard," cheered by the crowd, and praised for disrupting the capital. Meanwhile, the People's Liberation Army, in order to restore order and ensure the peace of the capital, was slandered and misunderstood by many "well-intentioned" people as suppressing students. They endured humiliation, bearing the pain of being misunderstood and cursed by the people they were supposed to protect. Under the watchful eyes of many, they were brutally killed, and even after death, their bodies were desecrated and left to rot in the streets, bearing the false accusations heaped upon them. From the television, I saw that those we once enthusiastically welcomed and proudly fought alongside, the "Workers' Autonomous Federation," were actually social dregs and counter-revolutionary rioters. The "democracy fighter" Fang Lizhi, whom I once admired and respected as a mentor, turned out to be a traitorous clown. He incited us and then fled to the American embassy, becoming a traitor to the nation under the protection of foreigners. I repeatedly ask myself in pain: Is this what we marched, sat in, and went on hunger strikes for? Right and wrong are confused, black and white are reversed, and the dizzying changes of the past month or two are like a nightmare! Reflecting painfully, I regret and hate! I truly want to cry out loud: We were deceived! We became tools for some people with ulterior motives, a card in their hands. During this period, society has had various comments and evaluations about our student actions. Based on this, they analyze and evaluate the current situation. If in the past, passionate emotions had suppressed reason, and for the sake of face, we created some illusions, now facing the painful consequences and bloody atrocities, we can no longer deceive ourselves! I have excerpted some of my diary entries from this period, not to exonerate myself or seek forgiveness. For this period of action, I fear that I will never be able to escape self-blame and regret in this life. I sincerely reveal some of the facade, only hoping that good-hearted people can truly understand us and prevent some people from using us as pawns. We will not be deceived again, nor do we want to be used to deceive others.

	I believe that I should settle my own accounts, and every upright person will review their past, summarize lessons. Therefore, in the diary, I have changed the names of the people mentioned. This is to explain.

		March 10, 1989, Friday
	I heard from an old classmate at X University that their teacher said in class that China's reforms have hit a dead end. Now, official profiteering is rampant, and corruption is widespread. China is beyond cure. An teacher said that some people say that people's living standards have improved, and many families have color TVs and refrigerators. This is nonsense, the remnants of rigidity. We benefit from the development of the times and the progress of science and technology. Modernization is not something that any one person or any one party can decide.

	I heard that this teacher, after graduating from the graduate school, was originally assigned to work at the State Planning Commission. He didn't go, saying that his ideas were not listened to there, so he chose to teach us and put his hopes in us.

	After hearing my classmate's words, I lost the spirit to study. Everywhere there is official profiteering and corruption, what's the point of studying? They are all graduates and still not useful, let alone us. We barely made it into university, let's just get by.

		March 29, 1989, Wednesday
	Old Liu is really talkative, Freud, Sartre, Nietzsche, he can talk about all of them. Now it's fashionable. In the morning, I skipped the party history class. It's only now that we are taking action, which is somewhat justified, seeing the teacher lecture so hard, dry and dull, what's the point.

		April 20, 1989, Thursday
	Under the leadership of Old Liu, some classmates went to Zhongnanhai today. I didn't go because Xiao Ou said they were going to shout slogans to overthrow the Communist Party. This is not a joke, if they catch us, none of us can escape. Without the Communist Party, who has the qualifications and ability to lead such a large country?

		April 27, 1989, Thursday
	The editorial in People's Daily caused a stir in the school. Old Liu said the government is going to take action against us. We must push away the sword hanging over our necks. Students will not have a good outcome. Ü teacher also sympathizes with the students, saying he didn't expect the higher-ups to be so unreasonable.

	Today, we marched on the streets. Old Liu arranged for the team to be well-organized, to carry out a non-violent petition march, and to shout the slogans "Support the Communist Party" and "Support Socialism" loudly, so that they can see that we students are not causing turmoil. Everyone agreed with his words.

	I joined the security team, responsible for maintaining order during the march. We shouted slogans like "Punish official profiteering and clean up corruption." The team was orderly. At the intersection of XX Road, we encountered the police blockade set up by the armed police. We broke through it, and many onlookers cheered and applauded in support. We broke through the armed police's blockade, and they didn't say anything and retreated. I was originally worried that they would use Beijing's parade law against us, causing a conflict, fortunately, there was none. However, Old Liu said: "Even if there is a conflict, we are not afraid. Let them beat us, let them arrest us. We will not fight back. We will use blood to awaken the masses. In fact, the government does not dare to suppress the students, once they suppress the students, they will be finished. I really hope they will suppress us."

	Ü teacher said that a sorrowful army will be victorious.

		April 28, 1989, Friday
	We suddenly became the center of attention. Everywhere people are praising us, saying that our actions have awakened the masses, we are the vanguard of democracy. No matter what the government says, our actions will shine brightly in Chinese history. Old Un and I share a room. Usually, he is lazy in his studies, gambling, playing mahjong, dancing, and traveling. Except for gambling, he is proficient in everything. Every night's bedtime chat, he talks the most vulgar and trivial, boasting about women as if he were an old hand. Now he has also become active, handling external relations and transmitting messages enthusiastically. The struggle has purified people.

		May 5, 1989, Friday
	The dialogue with Yuan Mu and He Dongchang has been the center of our discussions these days. At noon, I met Ü teacher. He told us to quickly find Zhao Ziyang's speech at the ADB annual meeting and study it carefully. He said to use our hearts to study, since China will not have turmoil, how can the student movement be labeled as turmoil!

	Is Zhao Ziyang trying to appease foreigners or support us? Old Liu said it's to support us, repeatedly saying: There's hope!

		May 9, 1989, Tuesday
	Tonight, we had a meeting in the cafeteria to select two representatives for the dialogue. Graduate student Old Ou went on stage to give a speech, refuting Yuan Mu's speech at the dialogue meeting on April 29th. Many people applauded him. He said that two Yuan Mus and He Dongchangs combined are not as knowledgeable as him. Such a government should not be expected to have any hope... I think he is too arrogant, although I don't like him, I have to admit that he has the talent to incite.

	I heard that X University has started a hunger strike at Tiananmen Square, and after his incitement, everyone suddenly became passionate and wanted to go to Tiananmen Square.

		May 13, 1989, Saturday
	We marched into Tiananmen Square in the afternoon, and our school flag was raised in front of the Monument to the People's Heroes. A large black flag with yellow characters reading "Hunger Strike" was also hung up. Before leaving, someone was worried that Gorbachev would arrive in two days, and it would not be good to go to Tiananmen Square then. Old Liu mocked the person who said this, saying he didn't understand politics at all. The day was chosen precisely because at this time, they (the government) would take it seriously and agree to our demands. Fortunately, I didn't speak up, or I would have been called naive.

	In the square, Old Liu arranged for a few people to sign up for the hunger strike, while the rest should spread out in the square and propagate to the masses, explaining our demands. We must make it clear that we have a patriotic heart, demanding to punish official profiteering and clean up corruption, but the government has labeled us as causing turmoil. They have no sincerity in dialogue, forcing us to come out and petition through hunger strikes. Do not say anything out of line, as there are plainclothes police. We must not give them any excuse to arrest us.

	The propaganda was successful, and the masses were on our side.

		May 17, 1989, Wednesday
	The number of people coming to the square to sit in and go on hunger strikes has reached more than two thousand. Today is the fifth day of the hunger strike. Many people gathered in teams and took cars to support us, and the square was so crowded that water could not pass through. Yesterday, many people in the school were still confused and content with mediocrity, but today they have suddenly become the vanguard of democracy and fighters, becoming the center of attention for the whole city and the whole country. The loudspeakers of the broadcasting station continuously broadcasted messages of support for us, and everyone felt their blood boiling, although it was hard to endure, we must grit our teeth and hold on, facing the strong support behind us, we cannot retreat!

	Today, a few more foreigners came to take photos and videos. Old Un was particularly enthusiastic, with a sense of pointing at the world and commanding the situation. He said, open a gap, and we can advance further and achieve greater victories. I knew his water was shallow, and after he came down, I asked him, what are you talking about? He mysteriously asked me back: What do you know, if you don't know, go ask the leader.

	I noticed that during these days, he often went to the southeast corner of the Monument to the People's Heroes, where the "High Autonomy Federation" command center was set up.

		May 18, 1989, Thursday
	I announced my hunger strike.

	In the afternoon, a sudden shower fell, and the students on hunger strike were safely taken away by large buses arranged by the city. Although no one died these days, the continuous calls of the ambulances made people's hearts ache, and many students were anxious and restless.

	At noon, Li Peng met with Wang Dan, Wu'erkaixi, and other hunger strike representatives at the Great Hall of the People. He proposed that for humanitarian reasons and for the precious lives of the students, the hunger strike should be ended as soon as possible and the students should go to the hospital for treatment. He affirmed our patriotic enthusiasm. I felt that his words were reasonable. But Old Liu said, Li Peng is playing for time, we must not be fooled! We must maintain the pressure on the government. As long as we persist in the hunger strike for more than seven days, the government will collapse. The "Workers' Autonomous Federation" and some cadres and civilians also came to remind us to hold on. Now the whole country and the whole world are watching us. If we soften and retreat, it will be too shameful. I had just started the hunger strike for a day, and it was even more difficult to say anything. The group effect bound everyone together, so-called freedom is also a luxury for us.

	What the goal is below, everyone is quite vague.

		May 19, 1989, Friday
	Early this morning, Zhao Ziyang and Li Peng came to the square to visit the students on hunger strike. They got on the front bus.

	It seems that the party and the government are desperate. If this continues, how will they end it?

	For a while, it has been said outside that Zhao Ziyang supports us. From his sincere attitude today, it seems that there is no mistake. Old Liu said that Zhao Ziyang was hesitant, definitely had difficulties, and was different from Li Peng. We must hold on in the square, and Zhao Ziyang might be okay. Now if we withdraw from the square, he will immediately collapse. He said it was really suspenseful.

		May 20, 1989, Saturday
	There are countless rumors in the square, some of which are obviously false. The radio broadcasted that Deng Yingchao was preparing to announce her resignation from the party, and even such absurd things it dared to broadcast, without fear of exposing its own cards. Although it is like this, we, who cannot see the future, can only rely on these to support and maintain our spirits.

	Originally, we were the ones leading the movement, controlling everything, but now we are out of control, being carried away by the movement, and it is difficult to get off the tiger's back, not knowing what to do.

	I heard that the People's Liberation Army was going to enter the city to suppress the students, and the square was in chaos. In the afternoon, many people went to various intersections and alleys to propagate, calling on the masses to come to the square to support us and fight side by side.

	The situation is tense, on the verge of explosion.

		May 30, 1989, Tuesday
	We have lost our goals and control, and our hearts are more chaotic than the square now. I and Old U, Old Un, and a few others were chatting, and each person talked about what they were most looking forward to at the moment. Old Un spoke the most absolutely, saying he was looking forward to the riot police coming, one person for each of us, to forcibly take us out of Tiananmen Square. Everyone agreed, and Old Un added, of course, we should also half-resist and half-cooperate. To make it grand, when we are taken away, we must raise our arms and shout loudly: Long live the Communist Party of China!

	The tents donated by Hong Kong are set up in the northeast of the square, very eye-catching. These days, our spiritual willpower has been supported by these supports. The "Goddess of Democracy" erected last night has also encouraged the students.

	Old Liu came to arrange, to defend the "Goddess of Democracy" statue to the death. He said that someone said it was illegal, what law? Struggling for democracy and freedom is the greatest law. Setting up the goddess statue can, first, set a symbol for our great movement and expand its influence. Second, it gives Li Peng a big headache. If he tolerates it, the government loses face, and its authority is further undermined. If he removes it, he can only use violence. As long as they dare to provoke a conflict, we can get rid of this deadlock, and we will be in the active position.

		June 1, 1989, Thursday
	Many people have been coming and going, back to school to take a bath, eat, and sleep for a while, and then come back to the square to show their faces. Anyway, we just have to hold on. I went back to school to take a bath and saw An teacher. I told him that if this continues, the students will be dragged down. He said, no problem, the government is more afraid of dragging on. To punish official profiteering and clean up corruption, we must be to the point. If this cannot be done, China will not be saved. I asked in doubt: Does punishing official profiteering solve all of China's problems? He said, of course not, I have never taken this as the core, but this slogan is easy for the masses to understand and accept. "April 27th" march without this slogan, could we get so much support? To attack the fortress, we must find a breakthrough, this is the art of struggle.

	Lying in bed, thinking about An's words, my heart was a bit uneasy. They say politics is dirty, and I have already smelled its smell in the stinky air above the square. I am afraid...

		June 3, 1989, Saturday
	The broadcasting station broadcasted that the troops had entered the city last night, killing a few civilians who died blocking the cars. Now Beijing is in danger, the square is in danger, let everyone quickly return to Tiananmen Square.

	Entering the city from the gap, everywhere people are discussing the troops' forced entry into the city, and people are anxious. In front of the Longan Theater at Xidan, a large bus with a roof rack placed with rifles, helmets, and military uniforms seized from the troops, and a horizontal banner reads: Look, this is the gift Li Peng's government gave to the people of Beijing! A person was giving a speech, saying that as soon as the troops entered the city, we would seize their weapons, and this car was their fate... The crowd immediately applauded.

	Entering the square, it was crowded again. The leaders said that the broadcasting loudspeakers said that the people below were transmitting, all were messages about blocking the People's Liberation Army at the main entrances to Beijing. The "Workers' Autonomous Federation" daredevil team set out. They were going to gather various vehicles to block the roads and prevent the troops from entering the city to Tiananmen. News from Huifang Bridge said that the troops and police had been driven away by the masses, and weapons had been seized... Conflicts occurred everywhere, and it seemed that some military vehicles were burned. A group of people from the west pressed over, chasing and beating the riot police. The police retreated into the Great Hall of the People. The crowd began to charge towards the Great Hall of the People.

	Beijing is in chaos!

		June 4, 1989, Sunday
	In the early morning, we were driven out of Tiananmen Square by the troops. When the leader asked for everyone's opinion on whether to withdraw or hold on in the square, I and the majority of people shouted together: "Withdraw!" We supported each other, holding flags, looking like a group of defeated soldiers, we left the square in teams. Someone cried excitedly, I looked back at the desolate surroundings of the Monument to the People's Heroes, a mess, like a garbage dump. We fought here (if it can be called that), once had hot blood here, but now I have no affection for this place at all. Perhaps it is because the place is empty, I suddenly saw that it was so dirty and chaotic, with a mix of sour, sweet, bitter, and spicy, I don't know what to say. Some say we lost the battle, some say this is a peaceful withdrawal, whatever it is, I think it's good to withdraw.

	I slept heavily, not wanting to listen or say anything.

	In the afternoon, "High Autonomy Federation" came to notify us that the leaders asked everyone to quickly leave the school, the troops were about to enter the school, it would be best to go to the countryside to visit relatives and friends. I hurriedly picked up a few books, a good man does not eat the loss in front of him, let's go.

		June 7, 1989, Wednesday
	Staying at home, Mom said she would not let me go out no matter what. These two days, there have been continuous news of people being beaten to death outside, and the old lady is even more afraid.

	In the afternoon, Xiao I came to see me. He was my classmate in middle school and now works at a grocery store. He said I was lucky to be able to escape from Tiananmen Square. I was surprised to hear this, and when I asked, it turned out that last night, Hong Kong Radio broadcasted a letter from a female student at Tsinghua University, saying that the troops had massacred Tiananmen Square, and most of the students had been mowed down by machine guns and some were crushed to death by tanks. The announcer read the letter, sometimes sobbing, and the listeners were all moved. They can really make things up! I don't know where this little fox came from. A while ago, I noticed that some people had never been on the square to go on a hunger strike, but when they talked about the square, they were more excited and passionate than us. I told Xiao I: nonsense, making things up. According to her, I should have been a "martyr" long ago. They make things up, and also rush to send us who withdrew from the square to the underworld as ghosts.

	It seems that whether we are alive or dead, whether we persist or withdraw, we are all materials for others to write articles. Pathetic, discouraged!

		June 9, 1989, Friday
	Today, I secretly returned to the school to take a look, and it was really cold and desolate. After inquiring, the troops had not entered the school at all, and we had been fooled again.

	I met Ü teacher returning from buying vegetables at the gate. He asked me to go to his house for dinner. I talked about the many messages I had heard from the television and outside these days, especially the letter from a female student at Tsinghua University, and I had a feeling of being deceived and betrayed. We had known many things with water mixed in. I didn't finish speaking, and Ü suddenly got angry, excitedly pointing at me and saying, you don't talk to me about these, I study astronomy, I am used to grasping problems from a macro and overall perspective, and I am not interested in these trivial details. You should not be blinded by these specific small things, and see the essence of the matter. I didn't expect him to suddenly become so excited to this extent. A few months ago, when a student proposed that we should love the party, love socialism, and have a correct starting point to view the problems that appear in life, Ü teacher also said that we should not start from empty things to look at problems, but look at the specific things, look at the official profiteering and corruption, and the suppression of democracy, which have made China what it is. How today he suddenly made a 180-degree turn, wanting to see the big picture and not the specifics.

	I silently got up and left his house, feeling extremely heavy-hearted. I walked out of his apartment building, looked back at the door, and said in my heart: Farewell! Let us take separate ways.

　　痛定思痛，我悔！我恨！    
    ——一个大学生的沉重反思和日记摘抄
    某学院一名二年级学生
    这些天我怕看电视，可又忍不住不能不看。一辆辆军车被烈焰吞食，一群反革命暴徒疯狂地追打解放军战士，特别是看到被残酷杀害在崇文门天桥下和西单的两位解放军烈士的遗骸，我的心像被刀扎，被火烧，精神几乎要完全崩溃了。
    “４·２７”游行时我曾经担任过纠察队队员。“５·１３”开始绝食，我先是活跃在声援团，后两天也进到了绝食队伍中。虽然我自始至终坚持绝不采取暴力对抗，没有投掷过一块砖头石块，可严酷的事实使我不得不承认，我们的热情、行动已被人利用，有意无意地推波助澜，使动乱发展成了反革命暴乱。我们被戴上了“精英”、“先锋”的桂冠，受人欢呼，被吹捧着搅乱了首都。而解放军为了恢复首都的正常秩序，保证首都的安宁，却遭诬陷被许多“好心”的人误解唾骂为镇压学生。他们忍辱负重，怀着好心而不能被人理解的痛苦，在自己要保护的许许多多人的围观下惨遭杀害，更残忍的是死后还遭残酷地凌辱暴尸街头，还要顶着被人捏造的恶名。从电视上我看到，当初我们热烈鼓掌欢迎引以为荣，要并肩战斗到底的“工自联”的许多人，原来都是社会渣滓，反革命暴徒。我曾经崇拜过、尊为导师的“民主斗士”方励之，原来是个叛国的小丑，他把我们煽动起来，自己却逃进了美国大使馆，在洋人的卵翼下成了民族的败类。我不断痛苦地责问着自己：这一切难道就是我们游行、静坐绝食要实现的目的？是非混淆、黑白颠倒，这一两个月令人眩晕的变化，如同一场噩梦！痛定思痛，认真反思，我悔！我恨！我真想痛哭一场，大声喊出：我们受骗了！我们成了某些别有用心的人的工具，成了他们手中的一张牌。这一段时间，社会上对我们学生的行动有各式各样的议论、评价。并据此分析评价眼前发生的事情。如果说过去狂热的感情曾压倒了理智，为了面子我们做出了一些假象，现在面对着惨痛的后果，血淋淋的暴行，我们再也不能自欺欺人了！我把自己这段时间的一些日记摘抄出来，目的并不在开脱自己，乞求宽恕。对这一段的行动，我怕今生今世都永难摆脱自谴和懊悔。我坦诚地撕开一些外衣，只求善良的人能真正理解我们，避免某些人还把我们当枪使。我们不再受骗，更不希望用我们去继续骗人。
    我认为自己的帐应该自己去了结，每个正直的真正的人都会审视自己的过去，总结教训。为此，日记中涉及到的人，我都将姓名改了，特此说明。
    　　　　１９８９年３月１０日　星期五
    听在×大的老乡讲，他们老师在课堂上讲，今天中国的改革已走进了死胡同。现在官倒盛行、贪污腐化成风。中国是病入膏肓无可救药。ａｎ老师说，有人讲现在人们生活水平提高了，许多人家都有了彩电、冰箱，这都是改革开放带来的。这是愚昧的胡说，僵化的余毒。我们得益于时代的发展，科技的进步，现代化可不是哪一个人，哪一个党能决定的。
    听说这位老师从研究生院毕业后，原本是分到国家计委工作，他不去，说他的主张在那儿没人听，所以宁肯来吃粉笔末教我们，把希望寄托在我们身上。
    听了老乡的话，我更打不起精神读书了。到处都是官倒、贪污腐化，这书读起来有什么劲。他们老师都是研究生毕业了还没用，我们就更别提了。好歹跨进了大学门，混吧。
    　　　　１９８９年３月２９日　星期三  　老ｉｕ真能侃，弗洛依德、萨特、尼采他都能侃一气。现在就这时髦。上午党史课，我溜号了。时到今日才采取行动，算是对得起他了，看老师讲得那么累，干巴巴的，有什么劲呀。
    　　　　１９８９年４月２０日　星期四
    在老ｉｕ带领下，我们班今天有人去新华门，听说打起来了。我没去，因为小ｏｕ说要呼打倒共产党的口号，这可不是闹着玩的，到时把你们抓起来一个也跑不掉。没有共产党，我们这么大的一个国家，谁有资格、有能力来领导？
    　　　　１９８９年４月２７日　星期四
    人民日报昨天的社论在学校炸锅了。老ｉｕ讲政府要拿我们开刀，不把架在脖子上这把刀推掉，学生们都没好果吃。ü老师也非常同情学生，说没想到上面会这么不通情理。
    今天上街游行，老ｉｕ布置一定要把队伍组织好，搞非暴力请愿游行，要把“拥护共产党”、“拥护社会主义”的口号喊得响响的，让他们看看我们学生是不是在搞动乱。大家都同意他的话。
    我参加纠察队，负责维持游行秩序。我们高呼“惩治官倒、清除腐败”的口号，队伍井然有序。在××路口碰上了武警公安设置的警戒线，我们一冲就冲破了，许多围观的群众向我们热烈鼓掌表示支持。我们冲破了武警的阻拦，他们也没说什么就退了。我原来担心他们会拿北京的游行法压我们，引起冲突，幸亏没有。不过老ｉｕ说：“发生冲突也不怕，就让他们打，让他们抓，我们决不还手。要用血来唤起群众。其实政府不敢把我们大学生怎么样，一镇压学生就得玩完。我还真盼他来镇压哩。”
    ü老师讲哀兵必祥。
    　　　　１９８９年４月２８日　星期五
    我们一下成了引人注目的中心。到处都在赞扬我们，说我们的行动唤醒了广大群众，我们是民主先锋，不管政府怎么说，我们的行动在中国历史上都占了光辉的一页。我的心中仿佛一下升起了一种神圣的使命感。老ｕｎ和我同房，平日学习吊儿郎当，一托（考托福）、二麻（打麻将）、三旋（跳舞）、四游（游山逛水），除一托和他没缘，其余样样鬼精老辣，每天夜晚的卧谈，就他聊得下流庸俗，吹女人俨然是个老鬼。现在他也积极起来了，对外联络，传递消息跑得挺欢。斗争把人净化了。
    　　　　１９８９年５月５日　星期五
    与袁木、何东昌的对话是我们这些日子议论的中心。中午碰到ü老师，他让我们赶紧找赵紫阳在亚行年会上的讲话看看，他说要用心研究，既然中国不会发生动乱，怎么还能给学生运动硬扣上动乱的帽子！
    赵紫阳到底是为了安抚老外还是支持我们？老ｉｕ说是支持我们，连声说：有戏！
    　　　　１９８９年５月９日　星期二
    今晚在大饭堂集会，准备选两名参加对话的代表。研究生老ｏｕ上台发表讲演，逐一批驳了袁木在４月２９日对话会上的讲话，不少人为他鼓掌。他讲，两个袁木和何东昌加一起也赶不上他的学识。对这样的政府根本就不应抱什么希望……我觉得他太狂了，虽然不喜欢他，也不得不承认他挺有煽动之才。
    听说×大已经在发起去天安门广场搞绝食，经他一鼓动，大伙顿时热血沸腾，也要去天安门。
    　　　　１９８９年５月１３日　星期六
    我们在下午开进了天安门广场，在纪念碑前的旗杆升起了我们的校旗，一面黑底黄字写着“绝食”的大旗也挂出来了。出发前有人担心后天戈尔巴乔夫就要来了，这时到天安门怕不好。老ｉｕ讥讽讲这话的傻冒，一点都不懂政治。选的就是这日子，在这种时候才能逼他们（政府）当回事，答应我们的要求。我幸亏没说话，要不也成傻冒了。
    在广场老ｉｕ布置除少部分签名绝食的，其余的人都尽可能在广场分开活动，向群众宣传，说明我们的要求，要讲清楚，我们怀着一片爱国之心，要求打倒官倒，惩治腐败，可政府却给我们扣上动乱的帽子，他们对对话毫无诚意，逼得我们出来绝食请愿。千万别说出格的话，人群中有便衣，要让他们什么把柄也抓不到。
    宣传成功，群众都向着我们。
    　　　　１９８９年５月１７日　星期三
    来广场静坐绝食的已达两千多人。今天是绝食的第五天，许多人集队乘车前来支持我们，广场被挤得水泄不通。昨天在学校里不少人还是浑浑噩噩自甘平庸的一代，今天一下子都成了民主的先锋、斗士，成为全市、全国注目的中心。广播站的高音喇叭不停地播放着声援我们的消息，大家感到浑身上下热血沸腾，虽然难熬，无论如何也要咬牙挺下去，冲着后面这么多强大的支持声援，我们决不能退！
    今天又有几起老外来拍照拍电视，老ｕｎ特起劲，大有指点江山挥斥方遒的味道。他说，冲开一个口子，我们就可以进一步前进，取得更大的胜利。他那点水我太明戏了，下来我问他，你都胡说八道什么呀，他神秘地反问我：你懂什么，不懂去问问头头。
    我注意到，这些日子他是常去纪念碑东南角，“高自联”的指挥部就设在那儿。
    　　　　１９８９年５月１８日　星期四
    我开始宣布绝食。
    下午下了场阵雨，绝食的同学们都安全地上了市里调来的大客车。这几天虽然没死一个人，救护车来来往往的呼叫声，叫得人挺揪心的，不少同学都烦躁不安。
    中午李鹏在人大会堂会见了王丹、吾尔开希等绝食代表，他提出为了人道主义，为了同学们宝贵的生命，要尽快结束绝食，到医院接受治疗。他肯定了我们的爱国热情。我觉得他的话是合情理的。可老ｉｕ说，李鹏在搞缓兵计，不能上当！要保持住对政府的压力，只要坚持绝食七天以上，政府就得垮台。“工自联”和一些干部、百姓也挺关心地跑来叮嘱我们要顶住。现在全国、全世界都在看着我们，要软下来，往后退就太掉份儿了。我刚绝食一天，更不好说什么。群体效应把大家绑在了一起，所谓自由，在我们这儿也是奢谈啊。
    下面到底还要达到什么目的，大家都挺模糊。
    　　　　１９８９年５月１９日　星期五
    今天一早赵紫阳、李鹏来广场看望绝食的同学。他们上了前面那辆大客车。
    看来党和政府是急眼了，再这么下去他们怎么收场？
    这一阵外面一直在传赵紫阳支持我们，从他今天那诚恳的态度看，是不会错了。老ｉｕ回来说，赵紫阳吞吞吐吐，肯定有难处，他和李鹏不一样。我们在广场坚持住，赵紫阳也许没事，现在一撤出广场，他马上就垮。说得还真悬了。

    广场上传的事多如牛毛，有的一看就是假的，广播里说邓颖超准备要宣布脱党，连这么荒唐的事它也敢播，也不怕自己倒自己的牌子。虽然如此，看不清前途的我们，也只能靠这些来支撑维持精神了。
    原来是我们在搞运动，我们主宰一切，现在却是身不由己，被运动卷着走，骑虎难下，不知该怎么办。
    听说解放军要进城镇压学生，广场又乱了。下午不少人分别去各个路口、小巷作宣传，呼吁老百姓来广场支援，和我们并肩战斗。
    形势紧张，一触即发。
    　　　　１９８９年５月３０日　星期二
    失去了目标，失去了控制，我们的心比现在的广场还要乱。我和老ｕ老ｕｎ几个侃大山，每个人都说说自己当前最盼的是什么。老ｕｎ讲得最绝，他盼防暴警察来，一人一个把我们强行架出天安门广场。大家一听都同意，老ｕ补充道，当然还要半推半就反抗一下。为壮行色，被架走时，一定要振臂高呼一声：中国共产党万岁！
    香港捐来的几顶旅游帐篷搭在广场东北，挺醒目的。这些天我们的精神意志就靠这些声援支撑着。昨晚树起来的“民主女神”又使同学们振作起来。
    老ｉｕ来布置，要誓死保卫“民主女神”像。他说有人讲违法，什么法？争民主争自由就是最大的法。树起女神像，一可以为我们这场伟大的运动树个象征，扩大影响，第二又给李鹏出了个大难题，他容忍不动吧，政府丢面子，威信更加扫地。拆除吧，只能使用暴力，只要他们敢挑起冲突，我们就能摆脱这种不死不活的局面，就主动了。
    　　　　１９８９年６月１日　星期四
    不少人已是三天打鱼两天晒网，回校洗个澡，吃饭睡上一觉，过一两天再到广场露个面。反正挺着就是了。我回学校洗完澡见到ａｎ老师，我告他这么下去同学们非拖垮不可。他说，没问题，政府更怕拖，要垮李鹏政府得先垮。在打倒官倒、惩治腐败上就得一针见血，连这都做不到，中国还能有救？我怀疑地问：难道把官倒惩治了，中国的问题就都解决了？他说，当然不行，我从来就没有把这当核心，但这个口号群众容易理解、容易接受。“４·２７”游行要不喊这个口号，能得到那么多人支持吗？要攻进堡垒就得找突破口，这是斗争艺术。
    躺床上想着ａｎ的话，心里有点犯嘀咕。他们说政治是肮脏的，我在广场上空的臭气中已经闻到它的气息。我怕……
    　　　　１９８９年６月３日　星期六
    广播站广播，昨晚部队进了城，压死了几个冒死堵车的市民。现在是北京危急，广场危急，让大家迅速回天安门广场。
    从豁口进城，到处都在议论部队强行进城的事，人心惶惶，在西单长安大戏院前面，一辆大客车顶篷上放着从部队手上缴来的冲锋枪、钢盔、军服等，一幅横幅上写着：看，这就是李鹏政府送给北京市人民的礼物！有个人在讲演，他说，部队一进城，我们就缴他的械，这辆车就是他们的下场……群众中马上响起了掌声。
    进到广场，这里又变得人群拥挤了，头头们说，广播喇叭讲，下面的人自己传，都是在进北京的主要路口地段堵截解放军的消息。“工自联”的敢死队出发了，他们要去把各种车辆集中横堵路口，阻挡部队进城到天安门。虎坊桥那边传来消息，部队和公安都被群众打跑了，还收缴了武器……到处都发生了冲突，好像烧了一些军车。西边一群人压了过来，是在追打防暴警察。警察退进大会堂。人群开始向大会堂冲击。
    北京全乱了！
    　　　　１９８９年６月４日　星期日
    凌晨，我们被部队赶出了天安门广场。当头头征求大家意见是撤离还是坚持守在广场时，我和绝大多数人一起高喊：“撤离！”我们互相搀扶着，举着旗，活像一群残兵败将似的集队离开了广场。有人激动地哭了，我回头看了看人去场空的纪念碑四周，一片狼藉，活像个垃圾场。我们在这儿战斗过（如果能这么说的话），曾经在这里热血沸腾，可现在对这里我已没有半点留恋之情，大概是人走空了的关系，我忽然看清这儿是那么脏，那么乱，酸甜苦辣说不清是什么滋味。有人说我们打了败仗，有人说这叫和平撤离，管它算什么，我看撤下来就好。　　今天这个结局挺他妈的好。
    闷头大睡，什么也不想听也不想说。
    下午“高自联”来通知，头头让大家赶紧离校，部队马上要进驻学校了，最好是到外地投亲靠友。我匆匆捡了几本书，好汉不吃眼前亏，走。
    　　　　１９８９年６月７日　星期三
    呆在家里，妈说什么也不让我出去。这两天外面不断传来有人被打死的消息，老太太就更怕了。
    下午小ｉ来看我，他原是我中学的同学，现在副食店干活儿。他说我命真大，还能从天安门跑出来。我听了挺奇怪，一问，原来是昨晚香港电台播了一封一个清华女大学生的信，说是部队血洗了天安门广场，大多数同学都被机枪扫射打死了，有的还被坦克活活压死。播音员念着这封信，有时声泪俱下，泣不成声，听的人都感动了。真能胡编！也不知道是从哪儿钻出来这么个小狐狸。前一阵我就看出了，有的主儿根本没在广场绝食，可他要侃起广场来比我们还激动，还要热血沸腾。我对小ｉ讲：扯淡、胡编。照她说的我早就该当“烈士”了。他们胡说八道，也别急赶着把我们这些从广场撤下来的当鬼往阴间打发嘛。
    看来不管是生还是死，是坚持还是撤离，我们都是被人作文章的材料。窝囊、丧气！
    　　　　１９８９年６月９日　星期五
    今天偷偷跑回学校看了一眼，真是冷冷清清一片凄凉。一打听，部队压根就没进学校，又上了一次小当。
    在门口碰到买菜回来的ü老师，他让我去他家吃饭。我谈到这几天从电视、从外面听到的许多消息，特别是清华大学那个女同学的信，自己有种上当受骗的感觉，我们以前了解到的东西有许多都有水分。我没说完，ü突然发起火来，激动地指着我说，你别和我谈这些，我是搞天文的，我习惯从宏观、从总体来把握问题，对这些枝末小节不感兴趣。你也不应该为这些具体的小事所蒙蔽，看不到事情的本质。我想不到他会突然狂躁到这种程度。在一两个月前有同学提出我们要热爱党，热爱社会主义，要有个正确的出发点来看待生活中出现的问题，ü老师还说看问题不能从空的东西出发，要看具体的，看看官倒腐败，压制民主，已经把中国弄成什么样子。怎么今天却来了个１８０°大转向，要宏观不要具体了。
    我默默起身离开了他家，心情异常沉重。我走出他的单元楼，回头看了一下房门心里说：Ｆａｒｅｗｅｌｌ！ｌｅｔ　ｕｓ　ｔａｋｅ　ｓｅｐａｒａｔｅ　ｗａｙｓ。（再见吧，我们各自走各自的路。）
