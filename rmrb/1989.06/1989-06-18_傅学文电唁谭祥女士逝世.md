Fu Xuewen, the wife of Mr. Shao Lizi, sent a telegram to Mr. Chen Lian, the son of Chen Cheng, to express deep sorrow over the passing of Mrs. Tan Xiang. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To Mr. Chen Lian,
No. 15, Fuzhou Road, Taipei:

I was shocked to hear of the passing of your esteemed mother. I am deeply grieved. In the past, my husband and I often accepted invitations from your father to visit and dine together, and the farewell with Xiang Jie before she went to Taiwan are all vivid in my memory. Unexpectedly, it has become a final parting, and the sorrow is unbearable. This year, on New Year's Day, I invited Xiang Jie to choose an auspicious day to return home to sweep the graves and visit the old residence in Hunan. Unfortunately, fate did not allow it, and we did not have the chance to meet one last time, which is truly regrettable. I send this telegram to express my condolences and hope you can bear the sorrow.

Fu Xuewen

    惊悉令堂大人逝世，不胜哀悼。昔日我与邵先生屡应令尊大人之邀登门宴叙以及祥姐赴台前握别情景，宛然犹在眼前，不期竟成永诀，悲痛不已，今年元旦，曾邀祥姐择吉归省扫墓，并到湖南故居看看。惜天不假年，未谋最后一面，实为憾事。特电致唁，尚望节哀。
