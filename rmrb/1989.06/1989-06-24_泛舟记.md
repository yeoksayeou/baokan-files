When I was in middle school, Qi Jun was my Chinese literature teacher. At that time, she had just graduated from Zhejiang University and, to avoid the war, returned to Wenzhou with Professor Xia Chengfeng to teach at Yongjia Middle School. Although Qi Jun was still young, she was already a distinguished disciple of Professor Xia and was deeply fascinated by poetry. Forty years later, today, her literary achievements are renowned in Taiwan, and in the field of poetry, she is indeed a worthy successor to the famous poet Xia Chengfeng.

In the approximately thirty years after the founding of New China, I had no news of her. With the increasing exchanges between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait, news about Qi Jun gradually became more frequent. Last winter, I saw a few of Qi Jun's works that the old principal, Ye Yunfan, had brought back from America. Among them, the one I particularly liked was "The Boat of the Poet." It was quite a coincidence that I soon received a copy. It was sent to me by a friend in Taiwan. The cover design was also unique in style, with green waters and blue mountains, a small boat, and an ancient atmosphere, taking the reader into a more ethereal and wonderful realm.

The author said that this book is not an academic monograph but an introduction that is easy to understand. As an introductory book, it is suitable for young friends interested in classical literature to read. This is the author's modesty. Although I am not young, I can understand the author's expectations, especially since I had listened to her lectures in my youth.

I enjoy reading Qi Jun's books, not only to learn from them but also to carefully savor the thoughts of my teacher, whom I have not seen in nearly half a century, from the lines of her writing. This will inspire more associations and memories. As Qi Jun said, a sensitive poet, when encountering the changing seasons and the blooming and withering of flowers, cannot help but be moved by the joys and sorrows of life. Poetry is the most suitable form of literature for expressing feelings of distress and melancholy, because the essence of poetry is elegance, subtlety, tenderness, and lingering affection. Poetry often blends emotion and scenery, with descriptions of scenery expressing emotions, and descriptions of emotions also expressing scenery. Although the works being explained are those of ancient poets, the explanations cannot help but infuse the emotions and resonances of the explainer. Therefore, holding Qi Jun's book, I carefully pondered it, as if I were back in my student days, sitting in the classroom, listening to Qi Jun teach. Her voice, her demeanor, always echoed in my mind. "In the south of the Yangtze River, I remember, most of all, the time I met you." Forty years later, today, what I can remember is still my teacher from my youth.

Qi Jun's comments on ancient poets have unique insights. For example, she uses the line "How long will the setting sun return?" from Yan Shu's work to summarize Yan Shu's style. She says that he knows the sun will set and rise again the next day, but tomorrow is not today, so the question "How long will it return?" is asked in a foolish and meaningful way. She uses the last line of Yan Shu's famous work "Washing the River Sand" to praise his leisurely and elegant style and his slightly melancholic life attitude, which is also a self-portrait of the author.

The author highly appreciates Su Dongpo's contribution to the innovation of poetry, and uses the line "Neither wind nor rain, nor clear sky" to summarize Su Dongpo's worldview. She appreciates how Su Dongpo made poetry not dependent on strict rules or music, but expressed its unique beauty through its own momentum, tone, and realm. Especially with his passion, he did not want to be constrained by strict rules. When he was drunk and in high spirits, he would freely change the sentence structure, often disregarding the rules. She believes that Su Dongpo's bold style had the deepest influence later on, but Su Dongpo's talent was not limited to the bold style. He could be bold and also elegant, free and also lingering. For example, his "Prelude to the Water Melody" is a famous work that combines boldness and tenderness. It is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and looking up, one sees a full moon, but he still asks, "When will there be a full moon?" It can be seen that the poet's heart is full of bitterness because he is spending the festival in a foreign land. Compared to Li Bai's "When will the clear moon come in the blue sky, I will stop my cup and ask," the feeling is different. The next line, "What year is it tonight?" seems even more foolish. Seeing true feelings in natural expressions, it becomes a timeless masterpiece.

Spending the festival in a foreign land, there is endless bitterness. The moon does not understand the pain of separation, "Last night the west wind withered the green trees, alone I climbed the high tower, looking towards the end of the horizon. I wanted to send a letter but had no paper, the mountains are long and the water is vast, where can I find you?" The latter half of the "Butterfly Loves the Flower" selected by Qi Jun is full of homesickness. "Alone I climbed the high tower, looking towards the end of the horizon" is the common voice of the people of the two sides of the Taiwan Strait who have been forcibly separated for 40 years, expressing the feelings of a traveler and the pain of separation! But in Qi Jun's "Prelude to the Rain" she writes, "My heart is already broken and tears are hard to hold back, it is always thinking of you but not climbing the highest tower," one is "alone climbing the tower" and the other is "not climbing the highest tower." The methods of expression are different, but the feelings are the same.

Qi Jun particularly likes the lines "The spring grass in the pond is all blurred, turning to feel that tonight's dream is better than none" from the Qing Dynasty poet Wu Zao's "Prelude to the Rain." She says that after waking from a dream, the spirit is even more confused, so it is better not to have any dreams at all. She uses this line to write another "Prelude to the Rain" that I mentioned earlier. I will copy the entire poem here:

	The letter of a thousand miles, who can send it?
	The flying geese have all passed.
	My heart is already broken and tears are hard to hold back,
	It is always thinking of you but not climbing the highest tower.
	In the dream, you should recognize the way home,
	But the dream has no basis.
	The events of ten years are already blurred,
	Turning to regret that today's thinness is better than none.

The poem mentions "already blurred" only for the "events of ten years," estimating that this poem is one of her early works after going to Taiwan. She said this poem was inspired by a tragic love story in Phnom Penh, but what I saw was also the remembrance of "the moon like a hook on the Stone City." The flying geese have all passed, the letter of a thousand miles, who can send it? For Wu Zao's line "The spring grass in the pond is all blurred," I think it will not be without Qi Jun's own feelings. The Xie Pool Lane in Wenzhou is named after Xie Lingyun's line "The pond is full of spring grass." In the early 1940s, Qi Jun lived in Xie Pool Lane in Wenzhou with Professor Xia Chengfeng. Here, she spent an important period of her literary career, and we, a group of students who loved literature, often came here to receive guidance from Professor Xia and her. We also carried out other literary activities together. Around 1983, Professor Xia filled a small tune "Reducing the Wood Orchid Flower" in Beijing, dedicating it to Pan Xizhen in Taiwan (Pan Xizhen is Qi Jun). It also mentions "The pond grass flies with clouds, the dream path should be the same as Yongjia." It is clear that the line "The spring grass in the pond is all blurred" has a very deep impact on the poets and teachers of the two sides, condensing the feelings of those who are separated.

　　泛舟记
    沙里
    中学读书时，琦君是我的语文老师。那时，她刚从之江大学毕业不久，因避战乱与夏承焘先生一起回到温州，执教永嘉中学。琦君虽还很年轻，但她已是夏先生的高足，对诗词很是着迷。４０多年后的今天，她在文学上的成就已著誉于台湾，在词学上也不愧为一代名家夏承焘先生的传人了。
    新中国成立后的大约３０多年中，我完全不知道她的讯息。随着两岸交往的增多，关于琦君的消息也渐渐多起来了。前年冬天，我在温州老校长叶云帆先生处看到他从美国带回的几本琦君的作品，其中我特别喜欢的一本是《词人之舟》。说也巧，不久，我果然收到了一本。那是一位在台湾的友人寄给我的。封面的设计也风格独异，绿水青山，扁舟一叶，古意盎然，把人带入更空灵美妙的境界。
    作者说，这本书不是学院派的专论，而是深入浅出的介绍。作为一种入门书，可供对旧文学有兴趣的青年朋友们阅读。这是作者的谦意。我虽非青年，但作者的期待我是能理解的，何况我在青年时代就曾听过她的课。
    我爱读琦君的书，除了想由此入门以外，也总想从字行里细细品味阔别近半个世纪的老师的思绪，借此引起更多的联想和回忆。正如琦君所说，一个灵心善感的词人，每遇春去秋来，花开花谢，哪能不引发对于人生的悲欢离合的感触呢？词是文学中最便于表达苦闷抑郁的情绪的，因为词的本色是婉约、蕴藉、柔媚与缠绵。词常常是情景交融，写景处是写情，写情处却又写景。讲解的虽是古人的作品，又不能不溶入讲解者的情思和共鸣。因此手捧琦君的书，我是细细地捉摸的，像是回到学生时代，端坐在课堂上，听琦君讲课。她那声音，她那神韵，总是在我脑际历历回荡。“江南忆，最忆识君时”，４０多年后的今天，我所能忆起的也还是青年时代的老师罢了。
    琦君对古代词人的评论，有她独到的见解，例如她以晏殊的“夕阳西下几时回”句，来概括晏殊的作品风格。她说，他明知太阳落下，明天依然会上升，但明天究竟不是今天，所以“几时回”三字问得痴，问得傻，也问得意味无穷。她以晏殊得意之作《浣溪沙》中这最后这一句来赞美他闲适淡雅的风格和微带伤感的生活情调，也未尝不是作者借以自我写照罢了。
    作者很赞赏苏东坡对词的变革性的贡献，同时以“也无风雨也无晴”句概括苏东坡的人生观。她赞赏东坡使得词不必依赖严谨的格律，也不必借助于音乐，而由其本身的气势、格调、境界表现出独特的美。尤其以他的豪情，不愿受严格的格律的约束。吟到酒酣意足之处，就任意改变句法，他是常常不顾格律的。她认为东坡的豪放风格对后来影响最深，但东坡的才情，并不局限于豪放一格。他能豪放也能婉约，能洒脱也能缠绵。例如其《水调歌头》就是一首豪放与柔媚的名作。既是中秋，抬头便见一轮明月，却偏要问一句“明月几时有？”可见词人内心因在异乡度佳节，有说不尽的辛酸滋味。比起李白的“青天明月来几时，我今停杯一问之”的心情是不同的。下面再问：“今夕是何年？”显得更痴傻。于自然处见真情，成为千古绝唱。
    异乡度佳节，说不尽的辛酸滋味。明月不谙离恨苦，“昨夜西风凋碧树，独上高楼，望断天涯路。欲寄彩笺无尺素，山长水阔知何处？”这首琦君选录的晏殊《蝶恋花》的后半阙，充满了去国怀乡之情。“独上高楼，望断天涯路”这正是被人为隔绝４０年的两岸同胞的共同的心声，是游子情怀与相思别离之苦的抒写！而琦君的一首《虞美人》中却写的是“柔肠已断泪难收，总是相思不上最高楼”，一个是“独上高楼”，一个是“不上最高楼”，“独上”与“不上”，表达的手法虽殊，情怀却是一样的。
    琦君特别喜欢清朝词人吴藻《虞美人》中的“池塘春草总模糊，转觉今宵有梦不如无”句。她说，一枕梦回，心魂更是恍惚，倒不如连梦都没做一个的好。她套用这一句也写了一首我在前面已经提到的《虞美人》，现将全词抄录如下：
    锦书万里凭谁寄。过尽飞鸿矣。柔肠已断泪难收，总是相思不上最高楼。
    梦中应识归来路，梦也无凭据。十年往事已模糊，转悔今朝分薄不如无。词中提到“已模糊”的还只不过是“十年往事”，估计这首词是她去台后的早期作品。她说这首词是为金边的一个悲惨的爱情故事所感动而写，但我看到的同样也是“石头城上月如钩”的怀念。飞鸿已过尽，锦书凭谁寄？对吴藻词中“池塘春草总模糊”句，我想也不会不是琦君自己的感触。温州的谢池巷是以谢灵运“池塘生春草”句命名的，４０年代初期，琦君在温州就住在谢池巷夏承焘先生的寓所里。在这里，不仅度过了她的文学生涯的重要时期，我们一批喜爱文学的学生，也经常来此得到夏先生和她的指导，她还和我们一起开展其他的文学活动。大约是１９８３年，夏先生在北京曾填了一首《减字木兰花·寄怀潘希珍台湾》（潘希珍即琦君）的小令，其中也提到“池草飞霞，梦路应同绕永嘉”。确见“池塘春草总模糊”句，对于两岸的词人、师生都有很深刻的感染力，凝聚着离人的情怀。
