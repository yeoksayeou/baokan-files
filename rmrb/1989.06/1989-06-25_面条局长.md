The impoverished region of Ankang has seen the emergence of a "feasting and drinking specialist" named Wei Mingsheng. Today, we introduce another figure, the "noodle bureau chief," Yang Zhan Shan, currently serving as the director of the Ankang Division of the Zhengzhou Railway Bureau.

Yang Zhan Shan assumed the position of division director in April 1984. Over the past two years, whether attending meetings, visiting family, or conducting on-site inspections, he frequently travels on trains operated by his division. According to relevant regulations and customs, when division leaders travel, the train conductor must first report on work progress and arrange a banquet, typically consisting of "four dishes and a soup." Initially, when four dishes were served, Yang Zhan Shan had three of them removed. He said, "One person can't finish four dishes; it's all wasted!" Later, as soon as he boarded the train, he would instruct, "The simpler the meal, the better. Don't bother the dining car; a bowl of noodles will do." The reporter interviewed several train conductors, and they all said: Now everyone knows that Director Yang only eats noodles on the train. We call him the "noodle bureau chief." Under Yang Zhan Shan's influence, several leaders of the Ankang Railway Division also make do with a bowl of noodles when traveling.

Several leaders of the Ankang Division (including Yang Zhan Shan) live separately from their spouses. In the past, while in other divisions, some leaders had the habit of drinking a couple of glasses of wine during meals. After coming to Ankang, they would bring bottles of wine to the small kitchen. Yang Zhan Shan patiently explained the pros and cons: "What do we eat in the small kitchen? The workers see it every day. How do they know if the wine you drink is bought by yourself? It's better to drink it in your own room." He repeatedly reminded the leaders of the division's life department: "Whatever is sold in the outside workers' canteen, the small kitchen should eat the same. Make it simple and delicious, and do not seek special treatment, just for convenience."

An official from the division's office told the reporter that in 1987, Director Yang returned 1,600 yuan in bonuses; in 1988, he returned 800 yuan. The reporter asked, "Why are the returned bonuses always whole numbers?" The answer was, "The issued bonuses are whole numbers." Yang Zhan Shan believes that the division director is responsible for overall work and should not accept bonuses from every department, such as spring transportation bonuses, energy-saving bonuses, leak prevention and collection bonuses, labor service company bonuses, etc. These bonuses should not be taken by himself. On January 28, the Ankang Railway Division achieved 1,000 consecutive days without major train accidents, ranking first in safety production across the entire railway system. The Zhengzhou Railway Bureau clearly stipulated in the reward decision that Director Yang Zhan Shan of the division should be rewarded 100 yuan, but he did not take this bonus either.

Yang Zhan Shan not only strictly requires himself but also manages his family and children well. In the more than two years he has been director, his family and children have not gained any "benefits" or "perks." On May 13, his wife, who works in the railway department, accompanied him to Baoji for a medical check-up. The two of them sat in soft sleeper seats. Yang Zhan Shan told the train conductor that his wife was not entitled to soft sleeper treatment according to regulations, and he paid the difference of 26 yuan for the hard sleeper and soft sleeper seats.

### “面条局长”

　　“面条局长”
    本报记者  景险峰
    安康这个贫困地区的行署机关，出了个“吃喝专员”魏明生。这里介绍一位“面条局长”，他叫杨占山，现任郑州铁路局安康分局局长。
    杨占山是１９８４年４月担任分局长的。两年来，不论是外出开会，回家探亲，还是现场办公，他经常乘坐本分局的列车。按照有关规定和惯例，分局领导乘车，列车长首先要汇报工作，同时要安排招待饭，标准一般是“四菜一汤”。开始时，端上四个菜，杨占山让撤下三个。他说：“我一个人，四个菜吃不完，都浪费了！”后来，他一上车就交待：“吃饭越简单越好，不要麻烦餐车，一碗面条就行了。”记者访问了几位列车长，他们都说：现在谁都知道，杨局长乘车只吃面条，大家称他为“面条局长”。在杨占山带动下，安康铁路分局几位领导乘车用餐，大都是一碗面条了事。
    安康分局有几位领导（包括杨占山），与爱人两地分居。过去在别的分局时，个别领导吃饭时，有喝一两杯酒的习惯。到安康以后，又拎着酒瓶上小灶。杨占山耐心陈述利弊：“咱们在小灶吃什么饭，职工每天都看得一清二楚，你喝的酒是不是自己买的，别人怎么知道呢？有酒还是在自己房子里喝好。”他一再叮嘱分局生活段的领导：“外面职工食堂卖什么，里面小灶就吃什么，做得清淡可口一些就行，不得搞特殊化，只图个方便。”
    分局办公室负责同志告诉记者，１９８７年，杨局长退回奖金１６００元；１９８８年，退回奖金８００元。记者追问：“退的奖金为什么都是整数”？答：“发的都是整数呗。”杨占山认为，分局长负责全面工作，不要每个部门发奖金全都去伸手，如春运奖、节能奖、杜漏保收奖、劳动服务公司奖等等，这些奖金自己都不能拿。今年１月２８日，安康铁路分局实现连续１０００天无行车重大事故，安全生产跃居全路先进行列。郑州铁路局在奖励决定中明确规定，奖给分局长杨占山１００元，他连这笔奖金也没有拿。
    杨占山不仅严格要求自己，而且能管好家属和子女。他当局长两年多，家属子女没有从中得到任何“好处”和“油水”。今年５月１３日，他在铁路部门工作的爱人陪他到宝鸡看病，两个人同坐软卧席。杨占山告诉列车长，他爱人按规定不能享受软卧待遇，他如数补交了硬卧与软卧差价２６元。
