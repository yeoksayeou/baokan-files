In the administrative offices, townships, street offices, and vast rural areas of Sand River City in Hebei Province, there stand 490 "administrative transparency columns." The masses call them "equality columns" and "supervision columns."

Based on the practice of the mayor's open reception days, Sand River City established "administrative transparency columns" at various levels starting in August last year. The main contents include: publicizing policies that are about to be issued to solicit and absorb public opinions; publicizing the implementation methods and procedures of issued policies, as well as the responsible units, personnel, and procedures for handling matters; and publicizing the results of handling matters. The issues of concern to the masses that are publicly announced mainly include: the "three recruitments" (recruitment of workers, cadres, and students), conversion from agricultural to non-agricultural status, allocation of graduates from colleges and universities, placement of military cadres, as well as the distribution of special funds and important materials allocated by higher authorities. The scope of administrative transparency in rural areas also includes financial revenues and expenditures, second-child birth quotas, and the allocation of residential land.

The "transparency columns" may be small, but their impact is significant. In just a few months, the number of letters and visits from the masses has decreased by one-third.

　　把群众关心的问题张榜公布
    沙河层层设政务公开栏
    本报石家庄６月１日电  本报记者陈国琦、河北经济报记者宋国胜报道：在河北沙河市市直单位、乡镇机关、街道办事处及广大乡村，矗立着４９０多个“政务公开栏”。群众称之为“平等栏”、“监督栏”。
    沙河市在实行市长接待日的基础上，于去年８月层层设立“政务公开栏”，主要内容包括：公开准备出台的政策，征求吸收群众意见；公开出台政策的执行方法、办事制度，以及承办单位、承办人和办事程序；公开办事结果。张榜公布的群众关心问题主要是：三招（招工、招干、招生）、农转非、大中专毕业分配、军队干部安置，以及上级拨发专款、重要物资分配情况等。乡村的政务公开范围还包括财务收支、二胎生育指标及宅基地发放等内容。群众把自己的看法随时投入栏旁的意见箱，很快反馈到上级机关。
    “公开栏”不大，作用可不小。短短几个月，群众来信、上访告状的减少了１／３。
