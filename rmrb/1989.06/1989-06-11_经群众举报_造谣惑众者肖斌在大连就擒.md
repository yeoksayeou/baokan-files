Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 11th.

The Martial Law Command Headquarters Press Office reports: On the evening of June 10th, the person who spread rumors and incited chaos in the "Live Coverage of the Cleanup of Tiananmen Square" broadcast on CCTV's News Simulcast, was captured in Dalian at 9:20 PM after a public tip-off.

According to information from the Zhongshan District Public Security Bureau of Dalian City, this person is named Xiao Bin, 42 years old, formerly the deputy head of the supply department at the original Dalian Fourth Rubber Factory, and currently employed as a business representative at the Dalian Star Sea Aluminum Window Factory.

Evidence from the television recording shows that on June 5th, Xiao Bin spread false information about the clearing of Tiananmen Square, saying, "I saw it. They used tanks and armored vehicles to crush people into a pulp, and they shot and beat them with batons. If they didn't die, they were shot again. Some were even stabbed with bayonets. It was too brutal, I've never seen anything like it. Now many people are thinking of ways to deal with them (referring to the martial law troops). If one of them comes out, we'll fight them one-on-one and kill them." He also gestured with two fingers, saying, "Now nearly 20,000 people have died, 20,000 people have died." The broadcast said, "It's all fake, fake."

Xiao Bin returned to Dalian on June 8th. At 9 PM on the 10th, Xiao Bin was buying cigarettes at a private stall in front of the Labor Service Company office building and continued to incite counter-revolutionary activities, spreading rumors that "the PLA killed more than 20,000 people in Tiananmen Square," "the blood on the square is this thick," "the bullets used by the troops have explosive tips, one shot creates a hole. They beat people with batons and then finish them off with a shot."

Two female citizens passing by noticed that the person spreading rumors on CCTV earlier looked very similar to Xiao Bin. They followed and monitored him, seeing him enter the "Beifang Building" hotel. They immediately stopped a police car on the road and reported the case to the nearby police station. Police officers quickly arrived at the hotel to investigate. Xiao Bin initially denied his actions in Beijing, but after the police played the television recording, he admitted to them.

Currently, the Zhongshan District Public Security Bureau of Dalian City is conducting a legal investigation of Xiao Bin.

    造谣惑众者肖斌在大连就擒
    新华社北京６月１１日电  戒严部队指挥部新闻处消息：６月１０日晚，中央电视台新闻联播中播放的《清理天安门广场纪实》中，那个造谣惑众，煽动暴乱的人，经群众举报，已于当日晚９时２０分在大连市就擒。
    据大连市公安局中山区分局提供的消息说，此人名叫肖斌，现年４２岁，是原大连第四橡胶厂供销科副科长，现受聘大连星海铝窗厂任业务员。
    据电视录像提供的证据表明，６月５日，肖斌就天安门广场清场情况当众绘声绘色地造谣说：“我看见了。用坦克车、用装甲车压，压成肉浆，还用枪打，用警棍打，打昏了再打一枪，有的没死，补一枪，还有的用刺刀挑，太凶残了，没有见过。现在好多人在想办法，只要他们（指戒严部队官兵）出来一个，是单挑，就杀死他。”他还伸出两个手指比划着说：“现在死了将近２万多，死了两万多。”广播里说的“都是假的、假的”。
    肖斌是６月８日返回大连的。１０日晚９时，肖斌正在市劳动服务公司办公楼前的个体商摊上买烟，并继续进行反革命煽动，造谣说：“解放军在天安门广场打死了两万多人”，“广场的血有这么厚”，“部队的子弹带炸子，一打一个洞。用棍子打倒后再补枪”。
    两位女市民经过这里时，发现刚才在中央电视台上播出的那个造谣者与肖斌非常相似，便跟踪监视，见他进了“北方楼”宾馆，立即在路上拦截警车到附近派出所报了案。公安干警迅速赶到宾馆查验，肖斌开始不承认在北京的所作所为，经公安干警播放电视录相，才承认。
    目前，大连市公安局中山区分局正在对肖斌依法审查。
