This spring's national forest fire prevention period ended on June 15. According to the Ministry of Forestry and the Office of the National Forest Fire Prevention Command, the number of forest fires this year has decreased by 57.6% compared to the same period in 1988, the best year since the founding of the nation. Major forest fires have been reduced by 79%. The area of affected forests and the number of firefighters who lost their lives have decreased by 35% and 42%, respectively.
