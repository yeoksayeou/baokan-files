	Unite and Fight the Enemy Together

	The editorial board of this newspaper

	Deeply exposing the conspiracy of a very few people to instigate turmoil and plan a counter-revolutionary rebellion, strengthening the unity of the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the entire nation, and to the greatest extent possible isolating and striking down a handful of reactionaries, is a crucial key to achieving complete victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

	In this counter-revolutionary rebellion, the most important political strategy of a very few people's conspiratorial activities is to try every means to incite the relationship between the people, the Party, the government, and the People's Liberation Army, and to use all means to sabotage the unity of the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the entire nation. They used the pretext of punishing corruption and demanding democracy, exploited some mistakes made by the Party and the government, and exploited the patriotic enthusiasm of young students to incite students to take to the streets to march, and to encourage students to go on a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square. They deceived innocent citizens to support them, and tried to stir up dissatisfaction among young students and citizens towards the Party and the government, in an attempt to use the power of the masses to force the Party and the government to yield and achieve their sinister goals. The State Council's decision to impose martial law in some areas of Beijing dealt a serious blow to their conspiracy, so they changed their tactics and directed their attacks at the People's Liberation Army. They spread rumors and incited the masses to block and attack the martial law troops, constantly provoking incidents, escalating contradictions, and creating and expanding some opposition between young students, citizens, the Party, the government, and the People's Liberation Army, causing the turmoil to escalate step by step. When their conspiracy was exposed by more and more people and was about to fail, they became desperate and made a last-ditch effort, instigating a shocking counter-revolutionary rebellion. They ruthlessly attacked key departments of the Party, the government, and the military, inhumanely slaughtered martial law troops, recklessly looted and burned state property, set fires everywhere, incited workers to go on strike, shops to close, and students to boycott classes, colluded with external reactionary forces, begged foreign reactionary forces to exert pressure on China, and attempted to politically isolate China and economically destroy China. However, their evil conspiracy did not succeed and will never succeed. Their reckless actions only exposed their true faces to the world, making them excellent negative examples for educating and uniting the people.

	The planners and organizers of this counter-revolutionary rebellion are mainly a very few people who have long stubbornly adhered to the bourgeois liberalization stance, engaged in political conspiracies, colluded with external and foreign hostile forces, and provided illegal organizations with core state secrets. The main perpetrators of various violent acts such as looting and burning are mainly some released criminals who have not been reformed, some political hooligan gangs, remnants of the "Gang of Four," and other social dregs. Their evil goal is to overthrow the Party's leadership, deny the socialist system, and establish a bourgeois republic that is subordinate to Western powers. If their conspiracy succeeds, the country will face greater turmoil and division, the People's Republic won by the sacrifices of millions of martyrs will be destroyed, the achievements of ten years of reform and construction will be lost, and the country will be engulfed in a white terror. Every true communist and every conscious citizen of the republic will not allow them to do so.

	The Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the Chinese working class, the faithful representative of the interests of all ethnic groups in China, and the core leader of the socialist cause in China. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the Communist Party of China has united with workers, peasants, and intellectuals of all ethnic groups in the country, united with various democratic parties, non-party democrats, and patriotic forces of all ethnic groups, adhered to the four cardinal principles, adhered to the general policy of reform and opening up, led the people of the whole country to carry out socialist modernization construction, and achieved remarkable results, recognized by the world. Of course, the Party has made many mistakes in its work, some of which are quite serious, but the Party's basic line is correct, representing the fundamental interests of the broad masses of the people of the whole country, representing the direction of the times, and thus has won the support and approval of the people of the whole country. The Communist Party of China does not deny or avoid its own shortcomings and mistakes and has the confidence and ability to correct its own errors. A very few people exploit some mistakes made by the Party in its work, trying to incite the masses to oppose the Party, attempting to fundamentally deny the Party's leadership, overthrow the Party's leadership, which is unpopular and doomed to failure.

	In this serious struggle concerning the future and destiny of the Party and the state, various contradictions are intertwined, extremely complex, the Party and the government, in accordance with the times, reasonably and appropriately, have taken extremely cautious measures. When young students used marches, sit-ins, and hunger strikes and other inappropriate means to put forward the slogans of punishing corrupt officials and eliminating corruption, the Party and the government fully affirmed their patriotic enthusiasm, had multiple dialogues with them, patiently listened to their opinions, persuaded them to stop the hunger strike and return to school, and repeatedly reminded them not to be used by a few people, distinguishing them from a very few people who caused the turmoil, and trying to ease the contradictions. When the turmoil gradually escalated, and the government, in a situation of no alternative, decided to impose martial law in some areas of Beijing, due to the deception of a very few people, innocent young students and citizens clashed with the martial law troops entering the city, contradictions intensified, and it was difficult to distinguish between good and bad. The Party and the government still took an extremely restrained attitude. However, the development of the situation did not change with people's good wishes. A very few people were not willing to accept their failure and finally instigated a counter-revolutionary rebellion. At this critical moment, the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council, representing the fundamental interests of the people of the whole country, took decisive measures to resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion and saved the People's Republic. The facts have proved that the Communist Party of China is loyal to the people, our government is loyal to the people, the Party and the government have the ability to stop the turmoil and also have the ability to suppress the rebellion, and have won the support and approval of the people of the whole country.

	The People's Liberation Army is a military force that serves the people wholeheartedly. In order to defend the great capital Beijing and carry out the sacred task of martial law, the broad cadres and soldiers, in the face of insults, attacks, beatings, and illegal kidnappings by the rioters, did not betray the people's trust, united as one, strictly observed discipline, bravely fought, and severely suppressed the counter-revolutionary arrogance of a handful of villains, quickly suppressing this counter-revolutionary rebellion. After suppressing the rebellion, they worked tirelessly, fought continuously, and did a lot of work to restore the normal order of the capital. They used their blood and loyalty to show that the People's Liberation Army is indeed a strong pillar of the People's Republic and a righteous army that loves and protects the people. They won the understanding and support of the people of the capital, including young students, and the respect and love of the people of the whole country with their actual actions.

	At present, the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion has achieved significant victories, the situation in Beijing and even the whole country is stabilizing and developing in a good direction, but the struggle has not ended. The entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the entire nation should seriously study the "Notice to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council," seriously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech when he met with military officers above the rank of general of the martial law troops, deeply understand the nature of this counter-revolutionary rebellion, distinguish right from wrong, raise awareness, and consciously maintain unity with the Central Committee of the Communist Party. We must draw clear policy boundaries. For the planners and organizers of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, for the rioters who created the chaos of beating, smashing, looting, and burning, we must promptly expose and report them, and punish them severely according to law, without leniency. For the general masses who took to the streets and other behaviors due to not knowing the truth, we mainly need to strengthen education, present facts, reason with them, and help them raise their ideological awareness. We must, according to the deployment of the Third Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, further rectify the economic environment, rectify the economic order, deepen the reform comprehensively, develop production, increase supply, and do a good job in economic work. We must further strengthen military-civilian unity, strengthen military-civilian and police-civilian relations, actively assist the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the public security police in performing their duties, quickly end the chaotic situation, and restore normal work, study, and living order. We believe that as long as the people of the whole country are closely united around the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the State Council, with one heart and one mind, we will definitely be able to overcome difficulties and achieve complete victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

　　团结起来　共同对敌

    深刻揭露极少数人挑起动乱和策划反革命暴乱的阴谋，加强全党、全军、全国人民的团结，最大限度地孤立和打击一小撮反动分子，这是夺取平息反革命暴乱全胜的重要关键。
    在这次反革命暴乱中，极少数人阴谋活动最重要的政治策略，就是千方百计地挑动人民群众与党、政府、人民军队之间的关系，不择手段地破坏全党、全军和全国人民的团结。他们打着惩治腐败、要求民主的幌子，利用党和政府工作中的某些失误，利用青年学生的爱国热情，挑动学生上街游行，鼓动学生在天安门广场绝食，蒙蔽不明真相的市民声援支持，竭力煽动青年学生、市民对党和政府的不满，妄图借用群众的力量，迫使党和政府就范，实现其不可告人的目的。国务院决定在北京部分地区戒严，他们的阴谋受到了严重打击，于是又变换手法，把矛头直接指向人民军队。他们谣言惑众，煽动群众拦堵和围攻戒严部队，不断挑起事端，激化矛盾，制造和扩大一些青年学生、市民与党、政府、人民军队之间的对立，使动乱步步升级。当他们的阴谋被越来越多的群众和干部识破、行将破产时，他们便狗急跳墙、孤注一掷，策动了骇人听闻的反革命暴乱。他们丧心病狂地冲击党、政、军要害部门，惨无人道地残害戒严部队官兵，肆无忌惮地打砸抢烧国家财产，四处点火，煽动工人罢工，商店罢市，学生罢课，内外勾结，乞求海外反动势力对中国施加压力，妄图从政治上孤立中国，从经济上搞垮中国。然而，他们的罪恶阴谋并没有得逞，也决不可能得逞。他们的猖狂一跳，反而使他们的真实面目大白于天下，成为教育人民、团结人民的极好的反面教材。
    这次反革命暴乱的策划者和组织者，主要是极少数长期顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场、搞政治阴谋的人，同海外、国外敌对势力相勾结的人，向非法组织提供党和国家核心机密的人。出面制造打砸抢烧等种种暴行的，主要是一些没有改造好的刑满释放分子，一些政治性的流氓团伙，“四人帮”的残渣余孽和其他社会渣滓。他们的罪恶目的，就是要推翻党的领导，否定社会主义制度，建立附庸于西方大国的资产阶级共和国。如果让他们的阴谋得逞，全国就会发生更大的动乱和分裂，几千万先烈用生命换来的人民共和国就会毁于一旦，十年改革建设的成果就会丧失殆尽，全国就会笼罩在一片白色恐怖之中。每一个真正的共产党员，每一个有觉悟的共和国公民，决不会容许他们这么做。
    中国共产党是中国工人阶级的先锋队，是中国各族人民利益的忠实代表，是中国社会主义事业的领导核心。党的十一届三中全会以来，中国共产党同全国各民族工人、农民、知识分子团结在一起，同各民主党派、无党派民主人士、各民族爱国力量团结在一起，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放的总方针，领导全国人民进行社会主义现代化建设，成绩卓著，举世公认。当然，党在工作中也有不少失误，有些甚至是比较大的失误，但是，党的基本路线是正确的，代表了全国广大人民群众的根本利益，代表了时代发展的方向，从而得到了全国人民的支持和拥护。中国共产党并不否认或回避自己的缺点和失误，有信心也有能力改正自己的错误。极少数人利用党在工作中的某些失误，竭力挑拨人民群众与党的关系，妄图从根本上否定党的领导，推翻党的领导，不得人心，这就注定了他们失败的命运。
    在当前这场事关党和国家前途命运的严肃斗争中，各种矛盾交织一起，异常错综复杂，党和政府审时度势，有理有节，采取了极其慎重的做法。当青年学生采用游行示威、静坐绝食等不适当的方式，提出惩治官倒、消除腐败的口号时，党和政府充分肯定了他们的爱国热情，多次与他们对话，耐心听取意见，劝导他们停止绝食，回校复课，并反复提醒他们不要被少数人利用，把他们与极少数搞动乱的人区分开来，尽量缓和矛盾。在动乱逐步升级，政府在万不得已的情况下决定在北京部分地区实行戒严时，由于极少数人的蛊惑，不明真相的青年学生、市民与进城的戒严部队发生了冲突，矛盾趋于激化，良莠难分，党和政府仍然采取了极其克制的态度。但是，局势的发展并不以人们的善良愿望为转移，极少数人并不甘心他们的失败，终于策动了反革命暴乱。在这危急关头，党中央、国务院代表全国人民的根本利益，采取断然措施，坚决镇压反革命暴乱，挽救了人民共和国。事实证明，中国共产党是忠于人民的，我们的政府是忠于人民的，党和政府有能力制止动乱，也有能力平息暴乱，得到了全国人民的支持和拥护。
    中国人民解放军是全心全意为人民服务的军队。为了保卫伟大的首都北京，执行神圣的戒严任务，广大指战员在遭到暴徒们疯狂辱骂、围攻殴打、非法绑架的情况下，不负人民重托，团结一致，严守纪律，英勇无畏，狠狠打击了一小撮歹徒的反革命气焰，迅速平息了这场反革命暴乱。平息暴乱后，他们不怕疲劳，连续作战，又为恢复首都正常秩序做了大量工作。他们以自己的热血和忠诚表明，人民解放军不愧为人民共和国的坚强柱石，不愧为热爱人民、保卫人民的仁义之师。他们以自己的实际行动，赢得了包括青年学生在内的首都人民的理解和支持，赢得了全国人民的尊敬和热爱。
    目前，平息反革命暴乱已经取得了重大胜利，北京乃至全国的局势趋于稳定，正在向好的方向发展，但是斗争并没有结束。全党、全军、全国人民要认真学习《中共中央、国务院告全体共产党员和全国人民书》，认真学习邓小平同志在接见戒严部队军以上干部时的重要讲话，深刻认识这场反革命暴乱的性质，明辨是非，提高认识，自觉地与党中央保持一致。要划清政策界限，对于反革命暴乱的策划者和组织者，对于制造打、砸、抢、烧的暴乱分子，要及时检举揭发，依法严惩，决不手软。对于不明真相、有上街游行等行为的一般群众，主要是加强教育，摆事实，讲道理，帮助他们提高思想认识。要按照十三届三中全会的部署，进一步治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序，全面深化改革，发展生产，增加供给，把经济工作搞好。要进一步搞好军民团结，密切军民、警民关系，积极协助解放军、武警和公安干警执行任务，尽快结束混乱状态，恢复正常的工作秩序、学习秩序和生活秩序。我们相信，只要全国人民紧密地团结在党中央、国务院的周围，万众一心，团结一致，就一定能够克服困难，夺取平息反革命暴乱的全面胜利。
