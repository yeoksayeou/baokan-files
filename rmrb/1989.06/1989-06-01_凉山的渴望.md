Early in the spring of February, we braved the falling snowflakes and drove from the heart of the Liangshan region in Zhaojue City to visit the copper smelting plant in Zhaojue County, Sichuan Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture.

The Zhaojue County copper smelting plant was established in the late 1950s and had experienced four cycles of rise and fall. It was not until the second half of 1987 that it miraculously turned around and became a renowned profitable enterprise in the Liangshan region.

"What is the reason for the copper smelting plant's revival?" I asked the county magistrate.

"Sigh, it's hard for the poor to do industry!" County Magistrate Shi Zhenghua (Yi ethnic) first sighed, then said, "We Yi people lack culture and are even less familiar with technology and management, so how can we run an enterprise well? Last year, we invited a few experts from outside, and the copper smelting plant turned losses into profits that year. Last year, it even made 830,000 yuan! So I say, the reason for the copper smelting plant's 'death' and 'rebirth' lies in the problem of talent."

In Liangshan, we also visited the counties of Xide, Yanyuan, Jinyang, Puge, and Mianning, as well as the Xichang region, and inspected some factories, enterprises, hospitals, and schools. Everywhere we went, people sighed like Shi Zhenghua: "We lack talent!" Jinyang County, located in the smaller Liangshan region, has 36 townships, 16 of which have no formal doctors in their hospitals! The county's teachers are also in short supply. The county's six middle schools are short of more than 130 teachers; of the existing teachers, only 48% have a college degree, the rest are high school students teaching high school students! Yanyuan County, which is primarily agricultural, has 46 townships, and to this day, 22 of them still have no agricultural technicians. When the Liangshan Steel Plant was built, they wanted to find local technical cadres, but after searching the entire prefecture, they couldn't find a suitable candidate, so they had to recruit talent from outside, even borrowing the plant manager. Due to a lack of talent, the Yi people and people of all ethnic groups here, despite guarding gold and silver mountains, live in "begging for food" conditions.

Liangshan is thirsty for talent. Therefore, they respect knowledge and respect talent. In Yanyuan County, we heard a story similar to Xiao He pursuing Han Xin: It was September 1985, when Chen Zhong, then deputy secretary of the Yanyuan County Committee, suddenly heard that Yang, a teacher at Yanyuan Middle School, had left without notice. Chen Zhong thought, Yang is a university graduate, young and strong, and the county's top math teacher, such a talent is a pity to lose. So, he immediately set out and chased Yang for more than 60 kilometers. He sat down and had a heart-to-heart talk with him, exchanging views. Yang was moved and returned to school the next day. The comrades in Jinyang County said, "Liangshan is not 'cold,' the hearts of the Liangshan people towards intellectuals are burning hot." This is true. One year, it was decided from above to allocate a medical college student to Jinyang County. The county's leaders heard the news and were as happy as if they had found a treasure: before the person arrived, they cleared out a room for him, and when he arrived, the director of the Health Bureau and a deputy county magistrate personally welcomed him...

Despite this, the phenomenon of "talent cannot be retained, cannot be transferred in" is still very common in Liangshan. As mentioned earlier, that Yang teacher eventually still left the mountain; the college student in Jinyang County left without notice just a month later! For some people, Liangshan has become synonymous with "desolation." A graduate of an agricultural university fainted on the spot when the leader announced that she was assigned to the Great Liangshan. A graduate of a normal university failed 7 courses in the graduation exam. The school negotiated with him: if you go to Liangshan to work, we will give you a diploma, otherwise, you can forget about graduating. In order to get the diploma, the graduate had no choice but to go to Liangshan.

Materials provided by Liangshan Prefecture show that the outflow of talent from Liangshan far exceeds the inflow. From 1981 to 1986, a total of 4,296 talents flowed out of the prefecture, while from 1978 to 1987, only 1,262 were brought in; from 1978 to 1987, approximately 6,000 students from Liangshan were admitted to colleges and universities, while the same period saw only 3,867 college graduates assigned to Liangshan Prefecture. As of October 1987, Liangshan Prefecture had a total of 40,730 intellectuals, of whom only 6,757 had college degrees, the latter accounting for only 1.9‰ of the total population of the prefecture.

The reasons for Liangshan's "talent cannot be retained, cannot be transferred in" are multifaceted. In addition to the fact that the party's policy towards intellectuals has not been fully implemented and the natural environment is relatively harsh, transportation is relatively closed, an important reason is that many intellectuals have serious concerns about the employment and education of their children. Some intellectuals who came to Liangshan in the 1950s and 1960s lamented: "For Liangshan, we have given our youth and our whole lives, given our whole lives and our descendants. In some minority-concentrated counties in Liangshan Prefecture, many factories and mines far from the county seat are unable to establish children's schools, most districts and townships have no middle schools, and it is very difficult for workers' children to go to school. A teacher in Butuo County has been teaching in the district and township for over 30 years, and none of his four children have found employment. The broad masses of intellectuals in Liangshan demand that their concerns be resolved as soon as possible so that they can settle down and contribute to Liangshan. They reflect that those Han children who have become "minority-like" do not enjoy policy benefits. They demand to change this factually unfair treatment. Some party and government cadres in Liangshan also hope that the state, when advocating for the "double-choice" system for college graduates, will fully consider the actual situation of minority areas and reserve a certain proportion of unified national allocation, otherwise, there will be few people willing to choose to come to such a harsh and backward place like Liangshan.

Liangshan lacks talent, Liangshan calls for talent!

### 凉山的渴望

　　凉山的渴望
    本报记者  贾昭全
    早春二月，我们冒着纷扬的雪花，驱车从大凉山腹地的昭觉城出发，访问了四川凉山彝族自治州昭觉县铜选厂。
    昭觉县铜选厂建于５０年代末，曾经四起四落。直到１９８７年下半年才绝处逢生，时来运转，成为大凉山上赫赫有名的赢利大户。
    “铜选厂起死回生，原因何在呢？”我问县长。
    “唉，翻身娃子办工业难啊！”县长施正华（彝族）先叹了一口气，然后接着说：“我们彝族缺少文化，更不大懂技术、管理，怎能办好企业呢！？前年，我们从外地请了几位能人来，铜选厂当年就扭亏为赢，去年居然赚了８３万元！所以我说，铜选厂‘死’与‘生’的原因，关键是个人才问题。”
    在凉山，我们还到过喜德、盐源、金阳、普格、冕宁等县和西昌地区，参观访问过一些工厂、企业、医院和学校，所到之处，人们和施正华一样地感叹：“我们缺乏人才！”地处小凉山上的金阳县，全县３６个乡镇中，有１６个乡的医院没有一名正式医生！这个县的教师也奇缺。县里６所中学共缺教师１３０多名；现有的教师里，也只有４８％达到大专学历，其余都是中学生教中学生！以农业为主的盐源县，全县４６个乡镇，至今还有２２个乡没有农业技术员。凉山钢铁厂建厂时，本想就地物色技术干部，可找遍全州也没有合适的人选，只好从外地引进人才，连厂长也是借来的。凉山由于缺乏人才，这里的彝族同胞和各族人民尽管守着金山、银山，却过着“要饭吃”的日子。
    凉山渴望人才。因此，他们尊重知识，尊重人才。在盐源县，我们听到一个恰似肖何追韩信的故事：那是１９８５年９月的一天，当时在盐源工作的县委副书记陈其中，突然听到在盐源中学任教的杨某不辞而别的消息。陈其中想，杨老师大学本科毕业，年富力强，又是县里第一流的数学老师，这样的人才走了实在可惜。于是，他立即出发，撵了６０多公里，追上了杨某。和他促膝谈心，交换意见。杨某被感动了，第二天便回到了学校。金阳县的同志说：“凉山不‘凉’，凉山人民对待知识分子的心是滚烫的。”这话是真的。有一年，上面决定分配给金阳县一名医科大学生。县里的领导听说后，高兴得像得了宝贝似的：人还未到，就给他腾了一间住房，来的时候，卫生局长和一名副县长亲自迎接……
    尽管如此，凉山人才“留不住，调不进”的现象仍很普遍。前面谈到的那位杨老师，后来还是下了山；金阳县的那位大学生，一个月后竟不辞而别！对于一些人来说，凉山简直成了“荒凉”的代名词。有位农大毕业生，当领导宣布她被分配到大凉山时，当场休克了。某师范学院一位大学生，毕业考试７门课程不及格。学校和他协商：如果你去凉山工作，就给你毕业证，否则休想毕业。为了拿到文凭，那位大学生只得逼上凉山。
    凉山州提供的材料表明：凉山人才外流大大超过引进。１９８１年至１９８６年６年间，全州外流的人才４２９６人，而１９７８年至１９８７年十年间引进的只有１２６２人；１９７８年至１９８７年凉山州考入大专院校的学生约６０００人，而同期分配到凉山州的大专毕业生仅３８６７名。截至１９８７年１０月，凉山州共有知识分子４０７３０名，其中具有大专文凭的才６７５７人，后者仅占全州总人口的１．９‰。
    凉山人才“留不住，调不进”的原因是多方面的。除了党的知识分子政策尚未完全落实和自然环境比较艰苦、交通比较闭塞等因素外，一个重要原因是许多知识分子在其子女的升学和就业问题上存在着严重的后顾之忧。一些五六十年代来到凉山的知识分子伤感地说：“对凉山，我们是献了青春献终身，献了终身献子孙。在凉山州的一些少数民族聚居县里，离县城较远的厂矿大多无力兴办子弟学校，多数区乡没有中学，职工子女上学困难很大。布拖县有位教师，在区乡任教３０多年，４个子女无一人就业。凉山的广大知识分子要求尽早解除他们的后顾之忧，以便安下心来为凉山做贡献。他们反映，那些基本“少数民族化了”的汉族子女却享受不到政策的优惠。他们要求改变这种事实上不大公平的待遇。凉山一些党政干部也希望国家在倡导大学生毕业分配“双向选择”时，要充分考虑到少数民族地区的实际情况，保留一定比例的国家统一分配，否则是没有多少人自愿选择到像凉山这样艰苦落后的地方来的。
    凉山缺乏人才，凉山呼唤人才！
