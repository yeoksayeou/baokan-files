In May 1981, I was injured and disabled during the self-defense counterattack against Vietnam, classified as a second-class Type A disability. On April 7 of this year, at the long-distance bus ticket office across from the Nanning Railway Station in Guangxi, I presented my disability certificate and requested that the ticket seller give me a half-price ticket from Nanning to Ningming County. However, the ticket seller coldly replied, "The buses are all leased out, so the disability certificate is useless now."

I am disabled for defending my country. Article 52 of the Military Service Law states: "Revolutionary disabled soldiers have priority in purchasing tickets for trains, ships, airplanes, and long-distance buses, and enjoy reduced fares according to regulations." Has the world changed so much that even disabled soldiers who have shed blood for the defense of the motherland are no longer sympathized with or cared for by society?!

### 汽车承包与残废证

　　汽车承包与残废证
    １９８１年５月，我在对越自卫反击战斗中负伤致残，属二等甲级残废。今年４月７日，我在广西南宁火车站对面的长途汽车售票处，拿出残废证，请求售票员卖给我一张南宁至宁明县的半价票。可是，售票员却冷冷地说：“汽车都承包了，残废证无用了。”
    我是为保卫祖国而致残的。兵役法第５２条规定：“革命残废军人乘坐火车、轮船、飞机、长途汽车，优先购票，并按照规定享受减价优待。”难道这年头变得一切向钱看，连为保卫祖国流过血的残废军人，社会也不再同情和照顾了吗？！
