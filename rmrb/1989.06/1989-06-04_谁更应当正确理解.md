	Who Should Understand Correctly
	Xú Xīnlín

	Currently, in the kingdom of mass media, the numerous newspapers reflect various units' methods of "situational education." These methods are mainly: comparing people's lives and national economic conditions before and after the reforms, hoping that cadres and the masses will correctly understand the current social situation (i.e., negative phenomena, corrupt phenomena), believe in the bright future of the reforms, and recognize that the path forward is still tortuous. They should strengthen their confidence in overcoming difficulties, and so on. The author believes that this approach is somewhat reminiscent of the past, where the emphasis was on how the future is bright and the path is tortuous.

	Some people say that nowadays, many people eat meat while cursing. How exactly do they "curse," and have those who blame them delved into the root causes?

	There is a couplet in our area: "The top is upright, the middle is crooked, and the bottom is chaotic; the diligent are poor, the lazy are rich, and officials get rich." The horizontal scroll reads: "The party's style is not upright." This couplet reveals that the people have fully enjoyed the fruits of reform and are very supportive of it. People are very clear in their minds about how self-reliant economies, colorful clothes, refrigerators, and color TVs came about. In other words, without reform, none of this would exist; if China does not reform, it will only return to the days of eating chaff and half a year's grain. These "sweets" have already been stored in people's hearts.

	So why do people still curse? This is mainly because they are disgusted by and powerless to change the negative, ugly, and corrupt phenomena in society, so they can only complain and curse. In a certain village, two years ago, the collective raised funds to build a coal mine, which could yield a net profit of 260,000 yuan annually. However, after two years, the villagers not only did not enjoy any benefits, but the collective also owed 230,000 yuan in debt. Where did the money go? According to a certain cadre within the village leadership, the seven members of the village committee each privately divided 80,000 yuan, and they also ate up another 100,000 yuan, so they ended up in debt. Three years ago, when the village party branch secretary was not a cadre, he could not even afford to build a kitchen worth 300 yuan. Now, he has built a house worth more than 20,000 yuan, and every village cadre is the same. Each cadre has a color TV, refrigerator, and other household appliances. How can this not make people "curse"? In some places, a recent crackdown on "official profiteering" was a big fuss but yielded no results. Some "official profiteers" became even more brazen, profiteering more and more shamelessly. How can this not make people curse?! A certain cadre who indulges in feasting and squandering public funds once, after eating his fill and drinking his fill, gave a situational education to the surrounding people: "Some people, seeing that cadres have eaten a little more, taken a little more, become envious, and complain. Everything must be correctly understood, right?" This cadre actually wants people to "correctly understand" his feasting and squandering, how can this not make people curse!

	Looking back at history, those who have ruined and brought chaos to the country have always been corrupt and greedy "officials." I believe that for China's reforms to proceed smoothly and for the social atmosphere to fundamentally improve, it is necessary to rectify the "corrupt officials." The majority of the masses only know how to work hard and are beneficial to society and reform. The current "pests" are mainly those corrupt officials who do not implement policies, engage in crooked practices, and make huge illegal gains. In a word, at present, those who need to "correctly understand" the reform policies are mainly the officials at various levels, not the masses. Once the party's style is upright, the masses' understanding will also become "clear."

### 谁更应当正确理解

　　谁更应当正确理解
    徐新林
    时下，大众传播王国里林立的报纸，反映各单位进行“形势教育”的形式，不外乎是：改革前后人民生活、国民经济的对比，希望干部、群众正确理解社会现状（即不良现象、腐败现象），要相信改革的前途光明远大，只是前进的道路还曲折，要增强克服困难的信心云云。笔者以为，这种做法有点像过去，大讲特讲前途是光明的、道路是曲折的味儿。
    有人说，如今不少人一边吃肉，一边骂娘。这“骂娘”是如何的骂法，责难者是否深究了根源？
    我们这里有这样一副对联：“上正中歪下乱来，勤穷懒富官发财”，横批：“党风不正”。此联道出：国人已经饱尝了改革的成果，是十分赞成、拥护改革的。人们心里特别清楚，自立自主的经济，花花绿绿的衣衫，冰箱、彩电是如何来的。也就是说，没有改革，就没有这一切；中国不搞改革，只能回到糠菜半年粮的年代。这些“甜”，人们已装入了心底。
    那为何还要骂娘呢？这主要是对社会上的不良现象、丑恶现象、腐败现象看不惯又无力改变，只能埋怨、骂娘。某乡有一个村，前年集体筹资办了一座煤矿，每年可获纯利润２６万元。然而，两年下来，村里群众不但没享受到一分利，集体反背了２３万元钱债。款到哪里去了呢？据该村领导班子内部某干部透露，村班子７名干部每人私分了８万余元，另外吃了十几万元，所以倒欠债。３年前未当村干部时连造价３００元的厨房都盖不起的村党支书，如今已盖起了造价２万余元的楼房，并且每个村干部都是如此。彩电、冰箱等一应家用电器，村干部也个个都有。这还能使人不“骂娘”吗？有些地方，前一段查“官倒”，折腾了一阵子竟没查出啥名堂。有些“官倒”反而变本加厉，越倒越凶，越倒越邪乎。这，怎能使人不骂娘呢？！有一位花天酒地、肆意挥霍公款的乡干部，某日吃饱喝足以后，对周围群众进行了一番形势教育：“有些人，看见干部多吃了一点，多拿了一点，就眼红，就发怨。任何事情都得正确的理解嘛。”这个干部竟要人们“正确理解”他的花天酒地，还能使人不骂娘！
    纵观历史，大凡败国、乱国之徒，无不是腐败、贪心不足的“官们”。我认为，中国的改革要顺利进行，社会风气要根本好转，非整整“腐败”的“官们”不可。大多数群众是只知道埋头苦干，对社会、对改革只有益而无害。现在的“害虫”，主要是那些不执行政策，搞歪门邪道，大捞特捞的腐败的“官们”。一句话，目下对改革政策需要“正确理解”的主要是各级的官们，而不是群众。党风端正了，群众的认识也就“清楚”了。
