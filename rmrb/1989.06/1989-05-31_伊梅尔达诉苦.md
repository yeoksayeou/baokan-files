	Imelda Complains
	The former Philippine President Ferdinand Marcos, who is in exile in Hawaii, is critically ill and on the verge of death. His wife, Imelda, is by his bedside, full of grievances.

	This former "First Lady" of the Philippines, once known for her opulence, complains to anyone who will listen about her family's "miserable" situation. According to a report by the American magazine *Newsweek*, Imelda has always believed that in February 1986, Marcos was "kidnapped" by the United States to Hawaii, forcing them into exile.

	The Marcos family now resides in a $5 million villa in the suburbs of Honolulu. Their annual living expenses amount to approximately $1 million, but Imelda claims she is living in "hell on earth."

	The Marcos couple is accused of embezzling hundreds of billions of dollars from the Philippine national treasury. Although the case is still under investigation, their lifestyle remains extravagant. They have three full-time chefs, one personal photographer, and a large entourage. Imelda has grown tired of "home-cooked meals" and often hosts banquets at the "Black Lantern" restaurant for friends and relatives. Not only does this change her diet, but it also helps her alleviate her sorrows. It is said that each banquet has about 40 guests, with an average cost of $50 per person.

	When mentioning the U.S. government, Imelda's anger is evident. She says, "Our family are all children of the United States. We come from your only colony. You once raised us, but now you are trampling on us." She believes that the New York court handling her husband's case will not conduct a fair trial because her image has been tarnished by the news media, and in the United States, almost everyone knows about her scandal involving 3,000 pairs of shoes.

	During her conversation with a *Newsweek* reporter, Imelda wore a ring adorned with a large diamond, sapphire, and ruby, symbolizing the colors of the Philippine flag. Her earrings were also made of three-colored gemstones. Her nails were painted with red stripes. She said that she and her husband long to return to their homeland to live as ordinary citizens and escape politics. When asked if she would be arrested if she returned to the Philippines, she replied, "I am not afraid of going to jail. At least in prison, food, accommodation, and medical care are all free."

　　伊梅尔达诉苦
    流亡在夏威夷的菲律宾前总统马科斯已病入膏肓命在旦夕，他的妻子伊梅尔达守在病床边，满腹怨气。
    这位珠光宝气的昔日菲律宾“第一夫人”逢人便诉说她一家人的“悲惨”处境。据美国《新闻周刊》报道，伊梅尔达一直认为，１９８６年２月马科斯是被美国“劫持”到夏威夷的，被迫过着流亡生活。
    马科斯一家现住在火奴鲁鲁近郊一座价值５００万美元的别墅中，每年生活开支约１００万美元，但伊梅尔达却说她处在“天堂中的地狱”。
    马科斯夫妇被控贪污菲律宾国家财产成百亿美元，虽然此案在候审中，但生活排场仍相当奢华。他们有３名专职厨师，１名私人摄影师和一大堆随从。伊梅尔达吃厌了“家常便饭”，经常到“黑兰”饭店宴请亲友，除换换口味之外还可消愁解闷。据说每宴的宾客在４０人左右，平均每人餐费５０美元。
    提到美国政府，伊梅尔达便怒形于色。她说：“我们一家人都是美国的孩子。我们来自你们唯一的殖民地。你们曾教养我们，但现在你们却蹂躏我们。”她说，受理她丈夫案件的纽约那所法院是不会进行公正审判的，因为她的形象已被新闻媒介丑化，在美国已几乎无人不知她拥有过３０００双鞋子的丑闻。
    在和《新闻周刊》记者谈话时，伊梅尔达手指上戴着一个镶有巨大钻石、蓝宝石和红宝石的戒指，象征着菲律宾国旗的颜色。她的耳坠也是由三色宝石制成的。她的指甲涂着红色条纹。她说她们夫妻切盼能回到祖国过平民生活，脱离政治。问到她如果飞返菲律宾有无被捕危险时，她说：“我不怕坐牢。至少在监狱里，吃、住和看病都可免费。”
