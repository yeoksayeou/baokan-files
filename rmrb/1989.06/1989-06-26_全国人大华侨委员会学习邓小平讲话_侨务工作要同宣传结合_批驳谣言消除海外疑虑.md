Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 26th.

The Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee held meetings on June 17th and 19th in Beijing to study Deng Xiaoping's speech during his reception of senior military officers from the capital's martial law troops and related documents. The meetings also included serious discussions.

The committee members believe that Comrade Xiaoping's speech is a guiding document of great importance. It will play an immeasurable role in unifying the thoughts of the entire Party, the military, and all ethnic groups in the country, thoroughly smashing the counter-revolutionary riots instigated and created by a very few people, and fundamentally stabilizing the current situation.

The committee members believe that the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing was determined by both the international and domestic climates. In recent years, Western capitalist countries have exploited problems that arose during the reform process in socialist countries to support these countries in pursuing capitalist liberalization and nurturing anti-communist forces. This is a reactionary trend against Marxism-Leninism and the Communist Party, aiming to overthrow the socialist system and replace it with a capitalist social system, and to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party in these countries.

The committee members believe that due to the slander and false propaganda of overseas reactionary forces, many overseas Chinese, foreign Chinese, and compatriots from Taiwan do not understand the truth and have doubts about the domestic government. We must patiently and meticulously do our work, explain the facts to them, and combine overseas Chinese work with the overall propaganda work. We must vigorously publicize the true facts, refute the reactionary propaganda abroad in a targeted manner, and make overseas Chinese, foreign Chinese, and compatriots from Taiwan understand that the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenum of the Eleventh Central Committee have not changed, and that the basic state policy of reform and opening up has not changed.

　　全国人大华侨委员会学习邓小平讲话    
    侨务工作要同宣传结合  批驳谣言消除海外疑虑
    新华社北京６月２６日电  据全国人大有关部门提供的消息：全国人大华侨委员会６月１７日、１９日召开在京委员会议，学习邓小平同志在接见首都戒严部队军以上干部时的讲话及有关文件，并进行了认真的讨论。
    委员们认为，小平同志的讲话是纲领性文件，非常重要，对于统一全党、全军和全国各族人民的思想，彻底粉碎极少数人煽动制造的反革命暴乱，从根本上稳定当前的局势，将产生不可估量的作用。
    委员们认为，在北京发生的这场反革命暴乱，是国际的大气候和中国的小气候所决定的。近几年，西方资本主义国家利用社会主义国家在改革过程中出现的一些问题，支持这些国家搞资本主义自由化，培植反共势力。这是一股反对马列主义，反对共产党的反动逆流，其目的就是要颠覆社会主义制度，用资本主义社会制度取代社会主义制度，推翻共产党在这些国家中的领导。
    委员们认为，由于海外反动宣传机器的造谣诽谤，许多华侨、外籍华人、台胞不明真相，对国内政府产生怀疑，对此我们要耐心细致地做工作，晓之以理，把侨务工作同整个宣传工作结合起来，大力宣传事实真相，对国外的反动宣传要有针对性地给予批驳，使海外华侨、外籍华人、台胞都知道，党的十一届三中全会以来的路线方针政策不变，改革开放的基本国策不变。
