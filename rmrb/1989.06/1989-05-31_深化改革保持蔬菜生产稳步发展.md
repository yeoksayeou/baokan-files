This year marks the fifth year of vegetable system reform in China's major and medium-sized cities. Over the past five years, the direction of vegetable system reform has been correct. It has mobilized the enthusiasm of producers and operators, promoted production development, increased varieties, enriched the market, and brought benefits to consumers. Currently, we should seriously summarize the experiences and lessons of vegetable system reform, continue to deepen the reform, and ensure the stable development of vegetable production.

In 1988, various levels of leadership seriously implemented the spirit of the vegetable system reform experience exchange meeting of the ten major cities in Xi'an, proposed that the mayor should personally oversee the vegetable fields, and ensured the vegetable field area. They overcame the difficulties caused by natural disasters and basically guaranteed the vegetable needs of urban residents. According to estimates, the vegetable supply in major and medium-sized cities across the country in 1988 was 21 billion kilograms, with an average daily supply of 500 grams per person, an increase of 5% over the previous year. Especially since May last year, the vegetable supply has increased, the supply of state-owned vegetable companies has been sufficient, the market prices have returned to normal, and residents are relatively satisfied.

On the other hand, there are still some unstable factors in the current vegetable production and supply in major and medium-sized cities: the situation of old vegetable fields in urban suburbs being occupied is serious, the facilities in distant suburbs, neighboring counties, and national vegetable bases are poor, the scientific cultivation level is low, and the commodity quantity is very unstable; the facilities of state-owned vegetable companies are simple, there are few vegetable cold storage facilities, and there is a lack of adjustment capacity for surplus and deficit; the construction of wholesale markets has just started, and there is a lack of vegetable distribution places; retail is mostly open-air sales, with sun and rain exposure, poor commodity quality, and high loss, etc., affecting the play of the leading role; most cities have not yet established vegetable risk funds and price stabilization funds, making it difficult to guide production according to market needs, adjust supply and demand, and stabilize vegetable prices; the vegetable circulation order is still not completely normal, especially in some production areas, the operation channels are chaotic, and the vegetable prices fluctuate greatly. The fundamental way to solve these problems lies in deepening the reform.

Common Experiences in Vegetable System Reform

(1) Establishing Multi-level Vegetable Commodity Bases. Many cities have implemented the policy of "near suburbs as the main, far suburbs as the supplement, and external adjustment." Practice has proven that the era of relying solely on near suburbs to solve vegetable supply has passed. From a national perspective, establishing a multi-level vegetable commodity base pattern is in line with the law of vegetable commodity production and sales development in China. With the expansion of urban construction, many old vegetable fields have been expropriated. While the living standards of urban residents improve, the demand for fine vegetables, varieties, and quality is also increasing. Each city should, while seriously grasping the construction of near and far suburbs vegetable fields, plan comprehensively and make the best use of the geographical, climatic, and other advantages of each place to establish different levels of vegetable commodity bases, striving to achieve a basic balance between the total supply and total demand of vegetables throughout the year, or a slight surplus. Some comrades have said well: too many vegetables are not good, too few are not good, neither too much nor too little is not possible, it is still better to have a little more than a little less. Vegetable work should stabilize production to stabilize consumption. The construction of vegetable bases has a trend. Generally speaking, the near suburbs have higher land rent, more income for farmers, better infrastructure, higher cultivation technology, and can build more greenhouses to grow more fine vegetables to meet higher-level consumption needs. Far suburbs and near counties should be used as production bases for major vegetables to ensure the supply of major vegetables. At the same time, it is necessary to develop national vegetable commodity bases for adjustment, as a supplement to the variety and quantity of vegetables in cities during the spring and autumn seasons. At present, China has initially formed vegetable commodity bases with a certain production scale, such as the large cabbage base in Tangshan and Shandong, the southern vegetables to the north base, the spring vegetable production base in Huaihai Economic Zone centered on Xuzhou, the autumn vegetable production base in Zhangjiakou Economic Zone, and the autumn vegetable production base in the Hexi Corridor in the northwest. These five bases can provide more than 20 billion kilograms of commercial vegetables each year, playing an important role in adjusting and supplementing the vegetable supply in major and medium-sized cities. However, the bases are still not standardized. The receiving cities should give support and assistance to gradually improve the base construction.

(2) Combining Management and Relaxation. Some comrades are right in saying that it is not feasible to manage without relaxation, and it is not feasible to relax without management. How to combine them? Nanjing is managing the big and relaxing the small, with the city managing 80% of the varieties accounting for the total market volume, mainly implementing contract procurement and planned prices, and the remaining 20% are negotiated for purchase and sale. Shanghai is "managing both ends and packaging the middle," that is, unifying planning and services before and after production, and contracting field management to households.

(3) Playing the Leading Role of the State-Owned Market Channel and Establishing Wholesale Markets to Form Multiple Circulation Channels. In terms of stabilizing prices, adjusting surplus and deficit, and implementing necessary absorption, the role of the state-owned vegetable market is indispensable. At the same time, the vegetable wholesale trading market also has great flexibility. In recent years, some major and medium-sized cities in China have successively established a number of vegetable wholesale trading markets, which have been welcomed by producers, operators, and consumers. However, from an overall perspective, China's vegetable wholesale trading markets are still in the initial stage of development, and various functions are not fully played. It is necessary to gradually improve them. Major cities should establish a number of large-scale, fully functional wholesale trading markets, and at the same time, establish a number of medium and small wholesale trading markets, gradually forming a network of large, medium, and small wholesale trading markets, which can gradually develop from spot trading to a combination of futures and spot trading.

(4) Implementing Production and Sales Integration. Since last year, various places have carried out pilot work in this regard and have achieved initial experience. At present, there are basically three types: one is that production and sales are unified under the management of the agricultural department; the second is to establish a comprehensive institution - the Vegetable Bureau or the Vegetable Office; the third is to unify the leadership of the deputy mayor in charge, and coordinate the two sides of agriculture and commerce. Production and sales integration should continue to be piloted. Although this experience is not yet perfect, the direction is correct. Since it is a pilot, there is no need to emphasize a fixed model.

(5) Gradually Improving the Production and Sales Service System. At present, China's vegetable production is basically based on household contract production, with small scale and scattered production. The contradiction between small production and large market is prominent. How to solve this contradiction, many cities have conducted explorations and achieved some experiences. In early 1988, the urban area of Tangshan City, with the Commercial Bureau as the leader, established a vegetable commercial association, attracting 159 professional vegetable growers and large vegetable stores to participate. They also established a vegetable cooperative in 6 key vegetable-producing counties, with the supply and marketing cooperatives as the leader, focusing on cabbage, and attracting more than 3,700 households to join. The vegetable commercial association and cooperative adhere to the principle of serving members first, and provide strong support to vegetable farmers in terms of materials, technology, information, transportation, sales, etc., and have achieved good results.

(6) Establishing Vegetable Production Risk Funds. This work has had a good start. Now the vegetable land occupation fee is a considerable amount, which can be fully utilized.

Several Problems That Need Further Study and Resolution

(1) Price Issue. Vegetable prices occupy a significant proportion in the overall price system, and their rise and fall have a great impact on the price index. The general policy is that the retail price of vegetables this year must remain basically stable. To this end, price departments at all levels should closely cooperate, strengthen management, and effectively control the increase in vegetable prices. For the major vegetables of the season, if the price is too high, it is necessary to regulate the price. For example, Beijing City implemented price regulation management for the market price of cabbage last year, which stabilized the rise in vegetable prices. All departments should unify their understanding, coordinate and cooperate, and guide the market price of vegetables. It is absolutely not allowed to relax the management of vegetable prices just because the vegetable situation is good.

(2) How to Better Play the Role of Subsidies. Last year, the price subsidy for vegetables nationwide reached 820 million yuan, an increase of 210 million yuan over the previous year, which played a significant role in stabilizing vegetable prices. Cities such as Nanjing, Chongqing, Xi'an, and Shenyang have opened up multiple channels to raise vegetable price adjustment funds, which have played a good role in protecting production and stabilizing prices. The current problem is that the state has spent so much money, first, how to better play its role; second, where to subsidize. Some cities have proposed that subsidizing the wholesale link may be more beneficial to protect the interests of producers and consumers, stabilize prices, and reduce some subsidies. No matter how to subsidize, subsidies cannot be eaten as a "big pot meal" or "scattered sesame salt." Subsidy funds must be used for their designated purposes and cannot be intercepted or misappropriated. They cannot be used for other purposes.

(3) Strengthening Technological Development, Improving Unit Area Yield, and Ensuring Vegetable Area. Without a certain area, it is not possible to guarantee a certain amount of vegetables. But the area cannot be expanded indefinitely. In the long run, we must focus on improving the yield per unit area to achieve stable production under drought and flood conditions. Therefore, we must do a good job in technological development. At present, the yield is not high, and technological development can significantly increase the yield. Shenzhen's soil-less cultivation of lettuce and cucumbers has become a foreign exchange-earning vegetable, sold to large hotels in Hong Kong, and earned a lot of foreign exchange. Huangqiao Township in Shanghai County has developed some new vegetable varieties, all of which are supplied to several large hotels in Shanghai. There is great potential in this regard nationwide.

(4) How to Play the Role of Scale Benefits. Scale operation mainly depends on efficiency, not simply on size. To do a good job in the scale operation of vegetables, we should learn from the experience of some countries in the world, starting from developing agricultural cooperatives or associations, and organizing production and sales services. Production and operation are managed by individual households, and production and sales are unified and responsible. Wholesale markets and agricultural cooperatives are the two legs of serving vegetable farmers and vegetable distribution. In developing agricultural cooperatives, supply and marketing cooperatives can play a good role. Supply and marketing cooperatives have a wide range and long legs, and the information is relatively timely. From its establishment, it has emphasized the mass nature. Although it is not yet done well, efforts should be made in this direction. In addition, for newly developed vegetable bases, if the land resources are not allocated to the collective and farmers, the beginning can be managed in the form of contract operations.

(5) The Issue of Legal Vegetable Management. This path must be taken, gradually achieving standardization, institutionalization, and legalization. At present, there seem to be three aspects: one is the wholesale market management law; two is the vegetable production base construction management regulations; three is the risk fund regulations. These three aspects can be piloted in various places.

　　深化改革保持蔬菜生产稳步发展
    陈俊生
    提要：大城市蔬菜体制改革的方向是正确的，取得了一些共性经验，如建立多层次蔬菜商品基地、放管结合、多渠道流通、建立蔬菜生产风险基金等；同时，需要深化改革，研究解决价格、补贴效益、科技开发以及搞好蔬菜规模经营、依法管菜等问题。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    今年是我国大中城市蔬菜体制改革的第５个年头。５年来，蔬菜体制改革的方向是正确的。调动了生产者和经营者的积极性，促进生产的发展，增加了品种，丰富了市场，也给消费者带来了利益。当前，应该认真总结蔬菜体制改革的经验教训，继续深化改革，以保持蔬菜生产稳定发展。
    １９８８年，各级领导认真贯彻西安１０大城市蔬菜体制改革经验交流会精神，提出市长亲自抓菜、落实菜田面积，克服了自然灾害造成的困难，基本上保证了城市居民的吃菜需要。据匡算，１９８８年全国大中城市蔬菜供应量为２１０亿公斤，人均日供应５００克，较上年增加５％。特别是去年５月份以来，蔬菜货源增多，国营蔬菜公司供应量充足，集市菜价趋于正常，居民比较满意。
    另一方面，目前大中城市蔬菜生产和供应仍存在一些不稳定因素：城市近郊老菜田被占情况严重，远郊、邻县和全国性蔬菜基地设施差，科学种菜水平低，商品量很不稳定；国营蔬菜公司经营设施简陋，蔬菜冷库少，缺乏余缺调剂能力；批发市场建设刚起步，缺乏蔬菜集散场所；零售多是露天卖菜，日晒雨淋，商品质量差，损耗大，等等，影响主导作用的发挥；大部分市蔬菜风险基金和平抑蔬菜价格基金尚未建立，难以有计划地按照市场需要指导生产，调剂供求、平抑菜价；蔬菜流通秩序还不完全正常，特别是有些产区经营渠道乱，菜价波动较大。解决这些问题的根本出路在于深化改革。
    蔬菜体制改革的共性经验
    （一）建立多层次的蔬菜商品基地。许多城市实行了“近郊为主，远郊为辅，外埠调剂”的方针。实践证明，光靠近郊来解决蔬菜供应的时代已经过去了。从全国看，建立多层次的蔬菜商品基地格局，是符合我国蔬菜商品产销发展规律的。随着城市建设的扩展，很多老菜田被征占。而城市人民生活的改善，对细菜、品种、质量的要求也不断提高。各市要在认真抓好近郊、远郊菜田建设的同时，统筹规划，尽可能利用各地地理、气候等优势，建立不同层次的蔬菜商品基地，力争做到蔬菜常年总供给与总需求基本平衡，或供略大于求。有的同志说得好：菜太多了不好，少了也不好，不多不少办不到，还是多一点比少一点好。蔬菜工作要通过保护生产来保护消费，稳定生产来稳定消费。蔬菜基地建设问题，有一个趋势，一般地讲，近郊级差地租比较高，农民收入比较多，基础设施比较好，栽培技术比较高，可以搞些大棚，尽量多种一些细菜，满足比较高层次的消费需要。远郊区、近郊县，要作为大路菜生产基地，以保证大路菜的供应。同时，还要发展全国性调剂的蔬菜商品基地，作为城市春淡、秋淡、品种、数量的补充。目前，我国初步形成了具有一定生产规模的唐山和山东的大白菜基地、南菜北运基地、以徐州为中心的淮海经济区春淡蔬菜生产基地、张家口经济区秋淡蔬菜生产基地、西北河西走廊秋淡蔬菜生产基地。这五块基地每年可提供商品菜２０多亿公斤，对调剂补充大中城市蔬菜供应发挥了重要作用。但基地现在还很不规范。销区各城市要给予支持和扶植，逐步使基地建设完善起来。
    （二）放管结合。有些同志讲得对，光管不放不行，光放不管也不行，还是放管结合好。怎样结合？南京是大管小活，市管的品种占总上市量的８０％，主要品种实行合同定购和计划价格，其余２０％议购议销。上海是“两头统中间包”，就是产前和产后统一规划和服务，田间管理承包到户。
    （三）发挥国营市场主渠道作用和建立批发市场，形成多种流通渠道。在平抑物价，调剂淡旺余缺，实行必要的吞吐等方面，国营蔬菜市场的作用是必不可少的，同时，蔬菜批发交易市场也具有很大的灵活性。近几年，我国一些大中城市先后建立了一批蔬菜批发交易市场，受到生产者、经营者和消费者的欢迎。但从总体来看，我国蔬菜批发交易市场，还处在发展的初级阶段，各项功能还发挥得不够，需要逐步完善。各大城市要建立一批规模比较大的、功能齐全的大型批发交易市场，同时，要建立一批中小型批发交易市场，逐渐形成大、中、小型结合的批发交易市场网络，可以由现货交易逐步向期货、现货相结合的方向发展。
    （四）实行产销一体化。去年以来，各地都在这方面进行了试点，已经取得了初步经验。现在基本上是三种类型：一种是产销统一归农口管理；第二种是成立综合机构——蔬菜局或蔬菜办公室；第三种是由分管市长统一领导，对农商两家进行协调。产销一体化要继续试行。尽管这个经验现在还不完善，但方向是对的。既然是搞试点，就不要强调某一种固定模式。
    （五）逐步完善产销服务体系。目前，我国蔬菜生产基本上是以农民家庭联产承包为主，规模比较小，生产比较分散，小生产和大市场之间的矛盾比较突出。如何解决这个矛盾，很多城市进行探索，并取得了一些经验。唐山市１９８８年初市区以商业局为龙头成立了蔬菜商社，吸收了１５９个种菜专业大户和经营量较大的菜店参加。他们还在６个重点产菜县以供销社为龙头，成立了以大白菜为主的蔬菜合作社，吸收了３７００多户入社。蔬菜商社、合作社坚持优先为社员服务，在物资、技术、信息、运输、销售等方面给予菜农大力扶持，已经取得了比较好的效果。
    （六）建立蔬菜生产风险基金。这个工作已经有了一个好的开端。现在菜地占用费是一笔相当大的数字，可以充分利用。
    需要继续研究解决的几个问题
    （一）关于价格问题。蔬菜价格在整个价格体系中占有明显比重，它的升降对物价指数影响很大。总的方针是，今年蔬菜零售价格必须保持基本稳定。为此，各级物价部门要密切配合，加强管理，有效地控制菜价上涨幅度。对于当季的大路菜，价格搞得太高的，必要时也可以规定限价。如北京市对去年大白菜集市价格实行限价管理，平抑了菜价上涨。各部门要统一认识，协调配合，指导集市菜价。绝不能放松对菜价的管理，不能因为蔬菜形势好了，就放松管理。
    （二）怎样更好地发挥补贴效益。去年，全国用于蔬菜的价格补贴，达到８．２亿元，比上年增加２．１亿元，这对平抑菜价起到很大的作用。南京、重庆、西安、沈阳等城市开辟多种渠道，筹集蔬菜价格调节基金，用以保护生产，平抑价格，起了很好的作用。现在的问题是，国家拿出这么多钱，一是怎样更好的发挥它的效益；二是往哪里补。有的市提出，补给批发环节，可能对保护生产者、消费者利益，平抑物价更有好处，又可以减少一些补贴。不管怎么补，补贴都不能吃“大锅饭”、“撒芝麻盐”。补贴款要专款专用，决不能截留挪用，不能用来干别的。
    （三）加强科技开发，提高单位面积产量，蔬菜面积必须保证。没有一定的面积，不能保证一定的蔬菜量。但面积也不可能无限扩大。从长远看，要立足于提高单产，做到旱涝保收。因此必须搞好科技开发。现在产量不高，搞科技开发可以大幅度提高产量。深圳搞的无土栽培生菜、黄瓜，成了创汇蔬菜，卖到了香港的大饭店，创收了不少外汇。上海县虹桥乡搞了一些蔬菜新品种，全部供给上海几个大饭店。这方面全国各地都大有潜力。
    （四）如何发挥规模效益问题。规模经营主要是要看效益，不是简单地归大堆。为搞好蔬菜的规模经营，我们应借鉴国际上一些国家的经验，从发展农协组织或者搞联合会入手，把产前产后服务组织起来。生产经营归一家一户，产前需要的东西统一组织，产销统一负责。批发市场和农协是对菜农服务和蔬菜集散的两条腿。在发展农协这方面，供销社可以起到很好的作用。供销社面多、腿长，信息比较灵通。从它成立开始，就强调群众性。虽然现在做得还不够，但要朝着这个方向努力。另外，新开辟的蔬菜基地，如果属于开发项目，土地资源没有划归集体和农户的，开始就可以搞承包性质的规模经营。
    （五）依法管菜问题。这条路非走不可，逐步做到规范化、制度化、法制化。现在看来有三项：一是批发市场管理法；二是蔬菜生产基地建设管理条例；三是风险基金条例。这三个方面各地都可以试行。
