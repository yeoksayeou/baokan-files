The World Cup qualifying match between the Chinese and Iranian football teams will be held in Shenyang in a week, but Shenyang fans are already unable to contain their excitement, and the "football fever" has once again swept through Shenyang.

In several "fan corners" around the city, groups of people have been gathering to discuss football. They talk about the characteristics of the Iranian team, the Chinese team's lineup, and strategies to defeat the opponent, all with great expertise. Local newspapers' sports columns also frequently publish insightful suggestions from fans. The president of the Shenyang Football Fans Association, Huang Zugang, has received over a thousand letters from fans across the region in recent days, some offering advice and others seeking tickets. Additionally, he receives visits from two to three hundred fans at his home every day.

Huang Zugang told reporters that Shenyang has hundreds of thousands of football fans, and this crucial match has captured their hearts. The city's football fans association recently held a mobilization meeting with over 2,000 participants. To ensure a spectacular and lively atmosphere, as well as a civilized, friendly, and rational environment, they have specially made 10,000 sets of fan jerseys and caps. The white fan jerseys have "China" written in large letters on the front and the signatures of all members of the Chinese football team on the back. Flags and balloons for the stands have been prepared, and 1,000 small trumpets and 300 cow horns have been specially prepared. At the time of the match, a 50-member orchestra from the Shenyang Military Region Forward Song and Dance Troupe will perform the "Fan Song" for the audience. The lyrics of this song were written by Hu Hongwei, the author of the theme song for "The Story of the Yangtze River."

It is understood that relevant departments in Shenyang have made meticulous preparations for this event, with arrangements for ticketing, transportation, order, and safety all in place. The expansion project of the Shenyang People's Stadium is in the final stages of completion and will welcome tens of thousands of enthusiastic spectators with a brand-new look in 10 days.

　　沈阳球迷急待中伊之战
    世界杯足球预选赛中国队与伊朗队的比赛一周后将在沈阳举行，但沈阳球迷已经按捺不住内心的激动，“足球热”再次袭击沈阳。
    在市内的几处“球迷角”，连日来出现一批批“侃球”的人们。他们从伊朗队的特点，到中国队的用人方案、制敌方针，讲得头头是道。此间报刊的体育专栏，也不时登出球迷们颇有见地的“主意”。沈阳市球迷协会会长黄祖刚几天内收到千余封各地球迷的来信，有的出谋划策，有的为求购门票。此外，他每天还要在家里接待二三百名来访的球迷。
    黄祖刚对记者说，沈阳市有几十万球迷，这场关键的比赛牵动着他们的心。市球迷协会日前已召开有２０００多人参加的动员大会。为了使比赛场面壮观，气氛热烈，文明友好，理智安全，他们特意制做了１万套球迷衫和球迷帽。白色的球迷衫胸前是“中国”两个大字，背后印有中国足球队全体成员的签名。看台上的旗帜和气球均已备齐，还特别准备了１０００支小喇叭和３００支牛角号。届时，沈阳军区前进歌舞团５０名乐手组成的乐队，将为观众高唱《球迷歌》伴奏。这支歌的词是由《话说长江》主题歌词作者胡宏伟所作。
    据了解，沈阳市有关部门为这场赛事进行了认真周密的准备，票务、交通、秩序、安全俱已妥善安排。沈阳市人民体育场的扩建工程正在抓紧最后的收尾工程，１０天后将以崭新的面貌迎接数万名热情的观众。
