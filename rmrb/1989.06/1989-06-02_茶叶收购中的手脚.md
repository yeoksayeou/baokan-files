Title: Corruption in Tea Procurement

The state promotes tea production by allocating fertilizer to tea farmers each year. However, many tea farmers find it difficult to obtain these fertilizers.

Why is this the case? The primary reason is that some tea procurement personnel abuse their power and shirk their responsibilities. In recent years, there have been frequent incidents of leaders embezzling allocated fertilizers. The situation is complex and cannot be explained in a few words; ordinary people find it hard to understand. However, it is commonly known that large quantities of allocated fertilizers end up in the hands of tea merchants.

During the spring tea harvest, tea farmers work the hardest and have the highest hopes of making money. Unfortunately, these hopes often fade away. Some tea procurement stations do not evaluate tea quality according to regulations, instead they downgrade and underprice the tea. Tea farmers have no recourse to complain or seek justice, and are forced to find other ways to sell their tea. Tea farmers near the county seat sell their tea on the streets, although they do not receive allocated fertilizers, they can earn a bit more money. Those who live far from the county seat, to save time and effort traveling to the procurement stations, are willing to give up the allocated fertilizers and sell their tea to door-to-door merchants.

Tea merchants buy tea at prices comparable to those of the procurement stations, so how do they make a profit? A former student of mine, who graduated a few years ago and now works as a tea merchant, revealed the secret to making money:

Last year, he took a truckload of spring tea to a procurement station. The station manager intentionally downgraded the tea. What to do? After dark, he gave the station manager a red envelope containing 1,000 yuan. The next day, the station upgraded the tea and gave him fertilizer coupons. Not only did he make a net profit of over 2,000 yuan, but he could also sell the fertilizer coupons at a high price. The hard-earned money of the tea farmers and the state's subsidies for them ended up in the pockets of a few tea merchants and station managers.

My student is still a novice in the tea trade. Some well-capitalized tea merchants make even more money and fertilizer coupons each year. They can earn in a few days what tea farmers earn in several years of hard work. Now, some tea farmers cannot afford high-priced fertilizer for their tea gardens, accelerating the aging of tea trees and causing a year-on-year decline in tea quality and quantity.

Due to some procurement stations not following regulations, the state ends up with high-priced, low-quality tea that cannot be sold. Reports indicate that the international reputation of Chinese green tea is declining, a situation that is worrying. If tea procurement methods are not improved soon, and tea farmers do not truly benefit from state subsidies, China's tea will lose its competitiveness in the international market, and tea farmers will have to change professions.

### 茶叶收购中的手脚

　　茶叶收购中的手脚
    国家为了发展茶叶生产，每年都要调拨一批化肥奖售给茶农。事实上，不少茶农却很难得到奖售化肥票。
    这是什么原因呢？主要是一些茶叶收购人员以权谋私，工作不负责任造成的。近几年来，一些地方经常发生有关领导干部截留奖售化肥的现象。这里面的事情错综复杂，三言两语无法讲清，一般老百姓也无法去弄清楚。不过，大宗的奖售化肥流入茶贩子手中的事情却时有所闻。
    春茶采摘期间，是茶农最辛苦，也最有希望赚钱的季节。可是，茶农的这种愿望往往落空，成为泡影。有些茶叶收购站，不按规定品评茶叶质量，压级压价，茶农有苦无处说，有理无处讲，只得另找门路出售茶叶。县城附近的茶农把茶叶拿到街上叫卖，虽然得不到奖售化肥，但可以多赚点钱。那些远离县城的茶农为了节省到茶叶收购站售茶的走路和排队时间，也愿意放弃茶叶奖售化肥，把茶叶卖给上门收购的茶贩子。
    茶贩子以相当于茶叶收购站的价钱购茶叶，为何能赚钱呢？我的一位前几年毕业的、现在当了茶贩子的学生，向我道破了赚钱的诀窍：
    去年，他将收购来的一车春茶拉到一家茶叶收购站出售。茶站负责人故意压级收购这批茶叶。怎么办？等到天黑后，他包了１０００元钱的红包塞给茶站站长。第二天，这个茶站就加价收购了这批茶叶，还给了他茶叶奖售化肥票。他不但净赚２０００多元，而且手中的化肥票还可卖高价。茶农的辛苦钱，国家给茶农的优惠，都给少数茶贩子和茶站负责人赚去了。
    我这个学生还是个“初出茅庐”的小茶贩。有些本钱雄厚的茶贩里手，每年贩茶赚的钱和化肥票，数目更加惊人。他们做几天贩茶生意赚得的钱，茶农就得起早摸黑干几年。现在，一些茶农无法买高价化肥给茶园施肥，加速了茶树的老化，致使茶叶质量和数量逐年下降。
    由于一些茶站不按规定收购茶叶，造成国家收购茶叶价高质次，无法推销出去。报载，目前我国的绿茶在国际上信誉下降，形势令人忧虑。如不尽快改进茶叶的收购办法，让广大茶农真正得到国家的优惠，我国的茶叶就会在国际茶叶市场上失去竞争能力，茶农也要改行了。
