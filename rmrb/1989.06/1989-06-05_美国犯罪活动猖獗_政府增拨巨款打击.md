	U.S. Crime Rampant, Government Allocates Massive Funds to Crack Down

	People's Daily, Washington, June 5 (Cang Lide) - To severely crack down on the increasingly rampant crime in the United States, President Bush announced on May 15 the allocation of an additional $200 million to build new prisons, increase law enforcement personnel, and impose the death penalty on serious criminals. He also proposed legislation to ban the import and sale of foreign semi-automatic assault weapons.

	The key points of this new plan are as follows:

	1. On the basis of the $500 million prison budget for the 1990 fiscal year, an additional $100 million will be allocated to increase the number of prison beds nationwide by 24,000, from the current 48,000 to 72,000.

	2. Law enforcement agencies such as the Department of Justice, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives will expand their staff and receive new funding.

	3. According to the law, those who commit serious crimes such as hiring assassins and terrorist murders will be sentenced to death.

	4. Legislation will be passed to permanently ban the import, manufacture, and sale of semi-automatic firearms that can fire more than 15 rounds.

	This new plan to combat criminal activities was announced by Bush at a public gathering outside the U.S. Congress. Bush also met with police officers who were injured on duty.

　　美国犯罪活动猖獗
    政府增拨巨款打击
    本报华盛顿电  记者仓立德报道：为严厉打击美国日益猖獗的犯罪活动，布什总统５月１５日宣布增拨２亿美元建造新监狱、增加执法人员，要求对重犯处以极刑，并谋求通过立法禁止进口及销售外国半自动进攻型武器。
    这项新计划的要点是，一、在１９９０财政年度的５亿美元监狱预算基础上追加１０亿美元，在全国范围内增加２．４万个监狱新床位，从目前的４．８万个床位增至７．２万个；二、司法部、联邦调查局、烟酒枪支管理局等执法机构将扩大编制并得到新拨款；三、依法重判持枪参与毒品犯罪的暴徒，对雇用谋杀、恐怖谋杀等重犯处于死刑；四、通过立法永久禁止从国外进口、制造及销售可连射１５发以上子弹的半自动枪支。
    这项打击刑事犯罪的新方案是布什在华盛顿国会外的群众集会上宣布的。布什同时还接见了在执勤中受伤的警官。
