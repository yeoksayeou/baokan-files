Kato Masao, known as the "Death Star" and "Executioner" in the Japanese chess world, is a formidable player who strikes fear into the hearts of many chess masters. In 1979, he won five out of the seven major titles in the Japanese chess world. In 1987, when the "Kato Volcano" erupted again, he held the titles of Meijin, Judo, Tengen, and Oza, and also earned the right to challenge for the Kisei title, seemingly poised to dominate the Japanese chess scene and usher in the "Kato Era."

However, just as volcanic eruptions are intermittent, Kato Masao's peak competitive form did not last long. In 1987, during his visit to China for a series of matches, his record was only 2 wins and 5 losses. He also lost three consecutive matches to Nie Weiping and Ma Xiaochun with scores of 0-2 and 1-2 respectively. If the losses in the series were due to lack of focus, then the World Professional Championship should have been his full effort. However, in two Fujitsu Cups and one Appleseed Cup, he failed to reach the top four. In the first Fujitsu Cup last year, he lost to Nie Weiping, and in the Appleseed Cup's semifinals, he was defeated by veteran Fujisawa Shuko. In this year's second Fujitsu Cup, he started poorly, losing to South Korean player Seo Bongsoo in his first match. Additionally, in last year's third China-Japan League Championship final, Kato again lost to Nie Weiping. Any excuses for these losses may seem weak.

This year, Kato has also struggled in a series of major domestic tournaments. In the Meijin challenge qualifying rounds, he lost his first three matches. In the Honinbo qualifying rounds, he finished last with 2 wins and 4 losses. In the first round of the Tengen tournament, he surprisingly lost to Kobayashi Shodan, leaving him without a chance to challenge for any titles this year except in the Oza tournament. The "Kato Volcano" seems to have entered a "dormant period."

### 加藤正夫进入“休眠期”

　　加藤正夫进入“休眠期”
    拥有“天煞星”和“刽子手”之称的日本棋坛高手加藤正夫，是一位令众多棋士望而生畏的虎将。他在１９７９年曾囊括日本棋界七大桂冠中的五顶。在１９８７年“加藤火山”再度爆发时，他又集名人、十段、天元和王座于一身，并又获得棋圣挑战权，大有在日本棋界独领风骚，开创“加藤时代”之势。
    然而，正如火山喷发是间歇的，加藤正夫的最佳竞技状态并未长久维持。就在他处于鼎盛的１９８７年，在访华对抗赛中，他的战绩仅为２胜５负，三番棋亦分别以０比２和１比２负于聂卫平及马晓春。如果说对抗赛失利是由于不太重视的话，那世界职业锦标赛当全力以赴了。可是在两届富士通杯和一届应氏杯中，他均未能进入前四名。去年的首届富士通杯赛上负于聂卫平，在应氏杯的复赛中又不敌耆宿藤泽秀行。在今年的第二届富士通杯赛上，他出师不利，上阵就被南朝鲜好手徐奉洙斩下马来。此外在去年的第三届中日擂台赛决赛中，加藤亦再次输给聂卫平。对这些失利，也许任何辩解都是苍白的。
    今年以来，加藤在国内的一系列大赛中也是南风不竞，在争夺名人挑战权的循环赛中，前三轮竟连连告负。在本因坊的循环赛中，他亦以２胜４负殿后。在天元战的首场争夺中，他竟失手于小杉七段，以至今年他除了在王座战中接受挑战外，其他头衔的挑战均与他无缘。“加藤火山”看来正进入“休眠期”。
