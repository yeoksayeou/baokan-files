To shorten the transition period and avoid further national crisis and public suffering, Argentine President Alphonsin announced tonight that he will resign from the presidency of the republic on June 30, handing over power to the elected president Menem ahead of schedule. According to the regulations, Alphonsin should hand over power to the newly elected president on December 10.

Elected President Menem expressed surprise at Alphonsin's decision. The two sides apparently failed to reach an agreement on the handover of power.

Alphonsin, in his televised speech tonight, said that after the May 14 elections, the domestic situation left the government with very little room to maneuver to solve the economic and social problems facing the country. Despite efforts, the situation could not be reversed. In this case, if the issue of power transfer is not resolved quickly, the country will face serious turmoil.

In recent days, representatives from Alphonsin and Menem have been in intense negotiations over the handover of power. Alphonsin hopes to step down gracefully within the constitutional framework, while Menem has not made a clear statement. Alphonsin, in his speech tonight, accused the Justice Party of widely publicizing the specific content of the economic policies that the future government will adopt through the media, causing further market chaos. Menem, in a statement after Alphonsin's speech, pointed out that while both sides were negotiating the handover issue, Alphonsin's announcement of his resignation on June 30 was at least surprising.

The Ministry of the Interior revealed today that the Electoral College will be convened on June 21 to complete the procedure for electing the president, so that on June 30, the Congress can confirm Menem as the president of the republic while accepting Alphonsin's resignation. However, Menem's spokesman said that the time is too tight for June 30, and the earliest Menem can take office is mid to late August. If the current crisis cannot be resolved, after Alphonsin formally submits his resignation to Congress according to the constitution, only the constitutional provision of the vacancy of the head of state can be invoked, and the president of the Senate, Menem's brother Eduardo Menem, will serve as acting president.

Currently, the Alphonsin government has completely lost its administrative capacity. The majority within the ruling party advocate for an early exit from the political leadership to avoid further damage to the party's prestige. The Justice Party has not yet fully prepared to take over the government, as there are disputes within the cabinet.

### 为缩短过渡时期  阿根廷总统宣布提前交权  当选总统梅内姆未接受阿方辛决定

　　为缩短过渡时期
    阿根廷总统宣布提前交权
    当选总统梅内姆未接受阿方辛决定
    本报布宜诺斯艾利斯６月１２日电  阿根廷总统阿方辛今天晚上宣布，为了缩短过渡期以避免国家陷入更严重的危机，人民遭受更多痛苦，他将在６月３０日辞去共和国总统职务，以提前向当选总统梅内姆交权。按规定，阿方辛总统应在１２月１０日向新当选总统移交权力。
    当选总统梅内姆表示对阿方辛的决定感到意外。双方显然未能就交权问题达成协议。
    阿方辛总统在今晚的电视讲话中说，５月１４日大选之后，国内形势的发展使得政府只剩下很少的活动余地，不足以解决国家面临的经济社会问题，虽然经过努力仍然不能扭转这种状况。在这种情况下，如果不尽快解决交接政权问题，国家将会爆发严重的动乱。
    最近几天，阿方辛派代表同梅内姆就交接政权问题进行紧张谈判。阿方辛希望在宪法范围内体面下台，梅内姆则不肯明确表态。阿方辛在今晚的讲话中指责正义党通过新闻媒介大肆宣传未来政府将采取的经济政策的具体内容，造成市场更加混乱。梅内姆在阿方辛讲话后发表一项公报指出，在双方已在就交接问题进行谈判时，阿方辛宣布６月３０日辞职至少是令人感到意外。
    政府内政部今天透露，本月２１日将召集选举人团完成选举总统的程序，这样，６月３０日议会就可以在接受阿方辛辞职的同时确认梅内姆为共和国总统。但是，梅内姆的发言人称，６月３０日时间太紧迫，最早要到８月中下旬梅内姆才能就职。如果目前的危机不能解决，在阿方辛按照宪法正式向议会提出辞职之后，只能援用宪法的元首空缺条款，由参议院代议长、梅内姆的弟弟爱德华多·梅内姆担任临时总统。
    目前，阿方辛政府已经完全失去行政能力。执政党内多数人主张及早退出政治领导地位，以免党的威信遭到更大损失。正义党实际尚未作好接收政权的准备，因为，在内阁班子问题上党内发生纠纷。
