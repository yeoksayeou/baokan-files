Title: Reading "A Chronology of Chen Duxiu"
Author: Ren Jianshu
Date: 1989-06-25
Edition: 6

The chronology of Chen Duxiu, co-compiled by Tang Baolin and Lin Maosheng, has been published with the support of Shanghai People's Publishing House.

The academic community has been paying serious attention to the study of Chen Duxiu since the Party's Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee called for emancipating the mind. Soon after, his family genealogy was discovered in Anqing, and his complete set of "Anqing Vernacular Newspaper," which he edited as early as 1904, was found in Shanghai. Many publications have subsequently published articles on his research. Chen Duxiu is an important and complex figure in modern Chinese history. His life was full of ups and downs and hardships, making him a worthy subject of study and reference. I believe that the study of him will continue to deepen and broaden. At this nascent stage, the publication of "A Chronology of Chen Duxiu" is indeed meaningful and gratifying.

This chronology is the result of the authors' years of diligent work. The book is nearly 400,000 words long and references some drafts of "Chen Duxiu Research Materials" co-authored by several comrades. It has been supplemented and revised several times. The materials are rich, the narration is concise, and there is a detailed account of Chen Duxiu's activities and political views after he joined the Trotskyist movement. This aspect of the materials is rarely seen by general researchers and is therefore more valuable. The chronology also provides brief annotations on relevant individuals, events, and organizations. For certain issues that are difficult to verify at the moment, the authors adopt a cautious attitude of suspending judgment and list various opinions. In summary, the chronology comprehensively and systematically reflects the life events and the development of the subject's thoughts.

A chronology is not a compilation of materials. The author can only excerpt what they deem important. Since it is an excerpt, there must be a selection process, and thus the author's views are consciously or unconsciously reflected in the selection. It can be said that different people will have different interpretations, and it is not appropriate to demand uniformity. The chronology reflects the current level of research on Chen Duxiu and is constrained by it. For issues on which the academic community generally agrees, the selection of materials is appropriate; however, for issues that are more controversial (such as the issue during the critical period of the Great Revolution), although many materials have been included, the narration is not as clear as the former, and the ability to distinguish between rough and refined materials seems insufficient. As for some minor flaws in certain details, that is inevitable. Overall, the book is flawless, and it is the best "A Chronology of Chen Duxiu" I have seen so far.

　　读《陈独秀年谱》
    任建树
    唐宝林、林茂生两同志合纂的《陈独秀年谱》，在上海人民出版社的支持下问世了。
    党史学界认真地关注对陈独秀的研究，始自党的十一届三中全会提出解放思想的号召，此后不久，在安庆发掘出他的家谱，在上海发现了他早在一九○四年主编的全套《安徽俗话报》，许多刊物相继发表了关于研究他的论文。陈独秀是中国近现代史上一个重要而又复杂的人物，他的一生跌宕起伏，历尽坎坷。是很值得研究和借鉴的。我相信对他的研究将会继续深入广泛地进行。在此方兴未艾之际，出版《陈独秀年谱》确是很有意义和令人欣慰的。
    这部《年谱》是两位作者多年辛勤笔耕的成果，全书近四十万字，参考了一些同志协作编写的《陈独秀研究资料》稿本，并几经补充，修改而成。资料丰富，叙事简洁，对陈独秀参加托派以后的活动及政治主张，也有详细的记述，这方面的资料为一般研究者所不易见到，因而更为可贵；对有关人、事、团体，作了简要的注释；对某些一时难以考订的问题，作者持审慎的存疑态度，罗列了各家之说。总之，《年谱》全面系统地反映了谱主一生的事迹及其思想发展的脉络。
    年谱不是资料汇编，作者只能摘录他们认为重要的段落，既然是摘录，就必定有所取舍，于是作者的观点有意无意地体现于取舍之中，可谓是仁者见仁，智者见智，是不应当强求一律的。《年谱》体现了当前对陈独秀研究的水平，并受其制约，对学术界看法基本上一致的问题，记事取材是确当的；而对那些争论较多的问题（如大革命紧急时期的问题），虽然收入了许多资料，叙事却不如前者清晰，对资料粗精的鉴别功夫似嫌不足。关于在某些细节上有所疵瑕，那更是难免的了。综观全书，瑕不掩瑜，是我迄今见到的最好的一部《陈独秀年谱》。
