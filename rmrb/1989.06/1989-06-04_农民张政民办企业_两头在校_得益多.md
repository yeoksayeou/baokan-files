Farmer Zhang Zheng Establishes a Business and Benefits from "Both Ends in School"

According to Xinhua News Agency, Xian, June 3 (Reporter Yang Runben) Zhang Zheng, a young farmer from Huayuan Village, Doumen Township, Chang'an County, Shaanxi Province, who was named a "National New Long March Pioneer" by the Central Committee of the Communist Youth League, has been deeply involved in the education sector since he took over the collective factory, construction team, and transportation team six years ago. He runs his business with "both ends in school."

One end is that the operational success of his business is due to the enthusiastic support of many institutions of higher learning. His enterprises are now linked with more than 10 colleges and universities, including Xi'an Highway College, Shaanxi Normal University, Northwest University, and Lanzhou University. Because many knowledgeable people provide timely information, teach technology, develop products, and guide business operations, his several factories and teams have increased their annual total output value and total tax revenue from the initial 30 million yuan and 500,000 yuan to the current nearly 200 million yuan and more than 20 million yuan.

The other end is that most of his family's income is used to support education in rural areas. In 1984, when he first had some savings after taking over the village's building materials factory, he voluntarily donated 760,000 yuan to build a "Huayuan Primary School" for the surrounding community. Subsequently, he insisted on spending tens of thousands of yuan each year from his own pocket to beautify the school campus, improve teachers' living conditions, and encourage students to study. The school's academic performance has consistently ranked among the top in the township.

　　农民张政民办企业
    “两头在校”得益多
    据新华社西安６月３日电（记者杨润本）被团中央命名为“全国新长征突击手”的陕西省长安县斗门乡花园村青年农民张政民，自从家庭承包集体工厂、建筑队、运输队６年来，一天一天地跟教育事业结下不解之缘，他办企业，“两头都在学校”。
    一头是，经营成效得力于许多高等学府的热情帮助。他的企业现已和西安公路学院、陕西师范大学、西北大学、兰州大学等１０多所大专院校挂上了钩。由于众多有知识的人及时给张政民提供信息、传授技术、开发产品、进行业务指导，他的几个厂、队年总产值、总利税分别从当初的３０来万元、５万来元，逐步增加到如今的近２００万元和２０万元以上。
    另一头是自家的收入大都用于为乡村办学兴教。１９８４年当他因承包村上建材厂而刚刚有了一些积蓄的时候，便主动捐资７．６万元，替周围群众修建一所“花园小学”。随后还坚持每年自掏腰包上万元，美化校园，改善教师生活，鼓励学生学习。学校教学成绩一直名列全乡前茅。
