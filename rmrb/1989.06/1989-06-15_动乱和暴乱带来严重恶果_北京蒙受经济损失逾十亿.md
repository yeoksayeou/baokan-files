The turmoil and counterrevolutionary riot that occurred in the capital have caused Beijing to suffer economic losses of over 10 billion yuan, according to relevant departments in the city.

Relevant departments in Beijing introduced that May and June are the golden season for industrial production. However, due to traffic disruptions, raw materials and parts could not be delivered, and products could not be shipped out. Many workers were unable to go to work normally, causing many enterprises to shut down or operate at half capacity. According to the Beijing Municipal Economic Commission, industrial output in the city decreased by more than 700 million yuan and tax revenue decreased by nearly 200 million yuan in May and the first seven days of June.

It is reported that the economic loss caused by the public buses burned by rioters alone is 13.896 million yuan, excluding the loss of operating income. According to the Beijing Railway Bureau, the passenger and freight transportation income in May decreased by 10.79 million yuan compared to the same period last year; from June 1 to June 10, 101 passenger trains were canceled, and 341 trains were delayed. The number of loaded and unloaded cars was 17,450 less than the planned number, resulting in a loss of 140 million yuan in transportation income over 10 days.

Due to the counterrevolutionary riot, the capital's tourism industry has fallen into a predicament. The occupancy rates of hotels and guesthouses have plummeted, a large number of taxis have stopped operating, and travel agencies have no groups to receive. According to statistics from the Beijing Municipal Tourism Bureau, the tourism loss in May was more than 40 million yuan, and the loss in the first 10 days of June reached 12 million US dollars.

Even during the earthquake and the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution, the bank note business did not stop, but this time it was forced to stop for 4 days during the counterrevolutionary riot. According to the People's Bank of China, Beijing Branch, 185,000 bills were accumulated during the 4-day suspension of bill exchange, with a total of 28 billion yuan in funds being frozen.

It is also reported that from June 3 to June 9 alone, due to the inability of agricultural and sideline products to be marketed in time and the insufficient operation of township enterprises, a loss of more than 3 billion yuan was caused.

The decline in production and operation in the economic and industrial sectors has had a serious impact on Beijing's fiscal revenue. According to preliminary statistics from the Beijing Municipal Finance Bureau, from May to June 10, over 40 days, the revenue decreased by 3.5 billion yuan compared to normal conditions, and expenditures increased by 1.3 billion yuan, with a total of 4.8 billion yuan in reduced revenue and increased expenditure.

　　动乱和暴乱带来严重恶果
    北京蒙受经济损失逾十亿
    新华社北京６月１５日电  （记者靳尚巩）据北京市有关部门介绍，首都发生的这场动乱和反革命暴乱，北京蒙受的经济损失据不完全统计已达１０多亿元。
    北京市有关方面介绍，五、六月份本是工业生产的黄金季节。但是，由于交通受阻，原材料、协作件运不进，产品运不出去，许多工人无法正常上班，造成大批企业停产或半停产。据北京市经委讲仅５月份和６月头７天中全市工业就减少产值７亿多元，减少利税近２亿元。
    据介绍，仅被暴徒烧毁的公共电汽车造成的经济损失就有１３８９．６万元，造成的运营收入还不在内。据北京铁路分局介绍，５月份的客货运营收入比去年同期减少１０７９万元；６月１日至６月１０日有１０１列旅客列车停开，３４１列晚点；装卸车比应完成数少装卸１７４５０车，１０天损失运输收入１４００万元。
    由于反革命暴乱，首都的旅游业陷于困境。饭店、宾馆的出租率急剧下降、出租车大批停驶、旅行社无团可接。据北京市旅游局统计，５月份的旅游损失为４０００多万元，６月上旬的损失达１２００万美元。
    在地震、文革动乱中也未中断过的银行票据业务在这次反革命暴乱中也被迫中断了４天。据北京市人民银行介绍，在中断４天的票据交换中，积存票据达１８．５万张，占压资金２８亿元。
    另据报载，仅６月３日至９日，由于农副产品不能及时上市、乡镇企业开工不足等就造成损失３亿多元。
    经济实业界的生产、经营下降，给北京市的财政收入带来严重影响。据北京市财政局初步统计，从５月到６月１０日的４０天中，比正常情况减少收入３．５亿元，增加支出１．３亿，两项合计减收增支达４．８亿元。
