Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 9th.

On June 3rd and 4th, after experiencing more than a month of turmoil, Beijing witnessed a shocking counter-revolutionary rebellion. With the heroic efforts of the soldiers of the martial law units of the People's Liberation Army and the police officers, and with the support and cooperation of the broad masses of the people, the initial victory of suppressing the rebellion has been achieved. However, this counter-revolutionary rebellion has not yet been completely suppressed. A small number of rebels are still plotting and spreading rumors to confuse people and make a comeback. They use weapons and ammunition they have seized to shoot, burn cars, smash sentry boxes, and attack shops and public places, attempting to make a desperate struggle. Currently, there are various rumors circulating in society, and many people do not fully understand the facts, and there are still some unresolved issues in their thoughts and emotions. Therefore, it is necessary to clarify the truth about this counter-revolutionary rebellion to the people, so that everyone can understand the background and development of the events, recognize the necessity and urgency of suppressing this rebellion, actively participate in the struggle, and contribute to stabilizing the situation in the capital.

1. Some comrades have asked, given that the situation of turmoil has eased in recent days, is it necessary for the martial law troops to enter the city?

It should be made clear that executing the martial law order issued by the State Council and completing the martial law tasks in some areas of the capital, the troops must enter the city. In fact, since the martial law order was issued on May 20th, the martial law troops have been advancing into the city every day according to the predetermined deployment, reaching their designated positions. It is precisely because of the gradual deployment of the martial law troops and the hard work of all parties that the situation of turmoil has begun to ease. However, it must be pointed out sharply that the activities of a small number of people to create turmoil have not stopped for a single day, and their goal of overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party has not changed at all.

They claim to have already decided on the members of the "new government," prepared lists of officials to be suppressed, continued to sit in at Tiananmen Square, and created incidents to achieve the goal of "overthrowing the current government and establishing a new government."

They actively organized forces, gathered hooligans, and recruited people who have deep hatred for the Communist Party and the socialist system, forming so-called "Flying Tiger Squad," "Volunteer Army," and "Suicide Squad," vowing to "detain" party and state leaders and to seize power in the manner of "storming the Bastille."

They used funds and materials provided by overseas reactionary political forces to prepare for long-term occupation of Tiananmen Square, established a "Democracy University," claiming it to be the "Whampoa Military Academy of the new era."

They erected a statue of a "Goddess of Freedom" in front of the Monument to the People's Heroes, which was originally called the "Statue of Liberty" and later renamed the "Goddess of Democracy," intending to use American freedom and democracy as their spiritual pillar.

They said, "We will use the struggle on the square to support the struggle nationwide," using extremely vile means to threaten young students, not allowing them to withdraw from the square, and even threatening, "Anyone who withdraws will be killed."

They were afraid that the students' sit-in petition would not be sustained, so they mobilized a "5,000-person hunger strike by intellectuals," but the call did not work, resulting in a farce of only 4 people participating in a 48-hour to 72-hour hunger strike.

They distributed leaflets inciting armed counter-revolutionary rebellion, advocating "a spark can start a prairie fire," shouting to form "armed forces," "unite all forces including the Kuomintang in Taiwan," and "be prepared to sacrifice their lives and shed blood, and openly oppose the Communist Party and its government."

All of this shows that the turmoil planned and premeditated by a small number of people is not, as imagined by kind-hearted people, gradually subsiding, but is changing its appearance and continuing to fight to the death with us.

They knew that once the martial law troops were fully in place and the broad masses were further mobilized and organized, their plots would be foiled. Therefore, they seized the opportunity to provoke incidents and escalate the turmoil.

On June 1st, after the public security organs arrested several leaders of the illegal organization "Workers' Autonomous Federation," they took the opportunity to incite some people to surround and attack the Beijing Public Security Bureau, the municipal party committee, municipal government offices, and the Ministry of Public Security.

On the evening of June 2nd, the Central Television Station borrowed a jeep from the armed police unit for 10 months, which overturned on its way back to the original unit due to excessive speed and slippery roads, killing 3 people and seriously injuring 1 person, none of whom were students. This was originally a traffic accident, and the relevant departments were handling it. However, a small number of people deliberately linked it to the martial law troops' planned entry into the city, spreading rumors that the advance car of the martial law troops deliberately ran over students, inciting those who did not know the truth to seize the bodies and hold a funeral procession. For a time, people's hearts were unsettled, and the atmosphere was extremely tense. After two days of incitement and clamor, the fire of the rebellion was ignited by them.

2. Some comrades have asked, is what happened on June 3rd enough to be called a rebellion?

This question is best answered by the facts.

At around 1 AM on June 3rd, when the martial law troops continued to enter the designated targets according to the plan, some people shouted and incited others to block vehicles at intersections such as Jianwai Dajie, Nanhe St., Xidan, and Muxidi, set up barricades, intercept military vehicles, beat soldiers, and seize military supplies.

At around 1 AM, 12 military vehicles were blocked near Lugu Village, soldiers passing by the front door of the Yanjing Hotel were forcibly searched, the tires of military vehicles in front of the Telecommunications Building were punctured, and they were surrounded by isolation pillars.

Before dawn, military vehicles were overturned at Yongdingmen Bridge, the tires of military vehicles at Muxidi were punctured, and more than 400 soldiers entering the city at Chaoyangmen were beaten with stones by thugs. Military vehicles were intercepted at six intersections and Hou'er Street, and soldiers were surrounded.

Before 7 AM, some thugs crawled into the military vehicles surrounded at Liujiazhuang, seized machine guns loaded with bullets. From Jianwai Dajie to Dongdan, as well as near Tianqiao, the entering troops were intermittently cut off and attacked. On the Jianwai Bridge, some soldiers' clothes were torn off, and some soldiers were beaten to tears.

In the morning, the entering troops at Hufangqiao were rushed, soldiers were beaten, and some had their eyes beaten out. Some injured soldiers were intercepted on their way to the hospital, the ambulance was deflated, and the injured were kidnapped. At Hufang Road to Taoran Park, 21 military vehicles were surrounded, and when soldiers were transferring ammunition, the accompanying police were beaten.

At noon, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army blocked at Fuyou Street South, Yizhong Road North, Xuanwumen, Hufangqiao, Muxidi, Dongsi, and other intersections were beaten, and some had their helmets, military caps, raincoats, water bottles, and bags seized. At some intersections, compressed biscuits and canned goods were scattered on the ground. A group of people intercepted a military vehicle loaded with weapons and ammunition at Liujiazhuang. The armed police and public security officers tried to rescue it multiple times but failed. If the vehicle's weapons and ammunition were seized or exploded, the consequences would be unimaginable. In order to protect the lives and property of the people of the capital, the armed police had to use tear gas to retrieve the ammunition vehicle. At this time, some students were injured and immediately sent to the hospital for treatment.

At the same time, a group of rioters began to besiege and attack state organs and important locations. They rushed the Great Hall of the People, the Propaganda Department, the Broadcasting and Television Department, and the West and South Gates of Zhongnanhai. Dozens of armed police and public security officers guarding these organs were injured.

As the situation worsened, the instigators of the rebellion became more rampant. At around 5 PM, a few people from the illegal organizations "High Autonomous Federation" and "Workers' Autonomous Federation" distributed knives, daggers, iron bars, chains, and pointed bamboo sticks to the uninformed masses in Tiananmen Square, claiming "catch a soldier or police and beat them to death." The "Workers' Autonomous Federation" broadcasted, calling to "take up arms and overthrow the government." Another group of rioters gathered more than a thousand people, knocked down a construction site wall near Xidan, seized a large number of construction tools and steel bars, bricks, and prepared for street fighting.

Look, is this not a rebellion? At this critical moment, the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission made a firm decision to order the martial law troops stationed around the capital to forcefully enter the city and suppress the rebellion.

3. Some comrades have asked, why did the troops open fire on civilians when they entered the city to suppress the rebellion?

Since the imposition of martial law, the martial law troops that have gradually entered the city have maintained a highly restrained attitude and have done their best to avoid conflicts, which is evident to all. After the rebellion broke out on June 3rd, before the main forces entered the city, to avoid harming the people, the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the martial law command issued an emergency notice at 6:30 PM, requiring "all citizens to be vigilant, from now on, please do not go out, do not go to Tiananmen Square. Workers should stay at their posts, and citizens should stay at home to ensure your safety." This notice was repeatedly broadcasted through radio, television, and various loudspeakers.

At around 10 PM on June 3rd, various martial law troops entering the city according to orders successively entered the urban area. However, they were seriously obstructed at various major intersections. Even in this situation, the troops still maintained an extremely restrained attitude. But a few rioters took advantage of this restraint to commit heinous acts of beating, smashing, looting, burning, and killing.

From 10 PM to 11 PM, from Cuigong Road, Gongzhufen, Muxidi to Xidan, 12 military vehicles were burned. Some people transported bricks by truck and hacked at the soldiers. Some rioters pushed trolleybuses to the intersections, set them on fire, and blocked the roads. Some fire trucks rushed to extinguish the fire but were smashed and burned.

At around 11 PM, three military vehicles were smashed at Hufangqiao, and one jeep was overturned. Military vehicles were blocked at Andingmen Flyover, a regiment of soldiers was blocked at Chongwenmen Street, 30 military vehicles were blocked at Jianwai Flyover, and more than 300 military vehicles were blocked west of Beijing Coal Industry School. To ensure the advance of military vehicles, some soldiers and commanders got off the vehicles to do guiding work but were attacked and beaten, and some were forcibly kidnapped and their whereabouts are unknown. The military vehicles obstructed at the gate of the Third Brigade in Nanyuan had to detour eastward to avoid conflict, and were again blocked at the South Gate of Tian Tan, with many military vehicles smashed and burned. At Zhushikou, a military vehicle was blocked, and a group of people climbed onto the vehicle. A person who looked like an official tried to persuade them to get down but was immediately beaten, and his fate is unknown.

After midnight on June 4th, the situation of burning military vehicles became more serious. At Tian Tan East Road, Tian Tan North Gate, West Exit of Dongdan Subway, East Road of Qianmen, Fuyou Street, Liujiazhuang, Xidan, Fuxingmen, Nanshizi Road, Muxidi, Lianhuachi, Chegongzhuang, Donghua Gate, Dongzhimen, and in Dabeiwa, Hujiayuan, Beidouqiaozhuang in Chaoyang District, and Jiuying Village in Daxing County, dozens of intersections and hundreds of military vehicles were set on fire by rioters using gasoline, Molotov cocktails, and homemade flamethrowers, with flames reaching the sky. Some soldiers were burned to death in the vehicles, and some jumped out of the vehicles and were beaten to death. In some places, several, more than ten, or even more than twenty vehicles were burned at the same time, creating a sea of fire. At Shuangjing Intersection, more than 70 armored vehicles were surrounded, and more than 20 machine guns on the vehicles were dismantled by rioters. From Jingyuan Road to the west of the Old Mountain Crematorium, more than 30 military vehicles were burned by rioters, and the scene was filled with thick smoke. Some rioters armed with iron bars, pushing oil drums, blocked the intersections, and when the vehicles were burned, the soldiers on the vehicles fired warning shots, but the rioters ignored them. A few rioters in the Fuxingmen Flyover area drove a seized armored vehicle, firing as they moved. The illegal "Workers' Autonomous Federation" also announced on the radio that they had seized a military radio and a codebook. Many military supply trucks and clothing trucks were looted by rioters, and their whereabouts are unknown.

Some rioters took the opportunity to engage in looting. The display windows of shops such as Yan Mountain in Xicheng District were smashed. A group of people set fire to the pine wall on the west side of the Chairman Mao Memorial Hall. Some public buses, fire trucks, ambulances, and taxis were smashed and burned. Particularly malicious was a group of people who pushed a public bus to the city gate of Tiananmen and set it on fire, attempting to burn down the Tiananmen Gate Tower, but it was extinguished in time.

While fiercely attacking military vehicles and engaging in looting, burning, and smashing, the atrocities of killing soldiers of the People's Liberation Army continued, and the methods were extremely brutal.

At around 4 AM on June 4th, a group of rioters at Dongdan Intersection used bottles, bricks, and bicycles to beat and hack at soldiers, and many soldiers were covered in blood. At Fuxingmen, a vehicle was intercepted, and 12 people on the vehicle, including the management section chief, management staff, and cooks of a certain unit, were pulled down and searched, then beaten, with many seriously injured. At Liujiazhuang, four soldiers were surrounded and beaten, and some died on the spot. Near Guangqumen, three soldiers were beaten, and only one was rescued by the crowd, while two are missing. In Xicheng District's Xixingsheng Hutong, more than 20 armed police were blocked by a group of thugs, some were beaten into serious injuries, and some are missing. At Huguosi, a military vehicle was intercepted, soldiers were pulled down and beaten, then held hostage, and a batch of submachine guns were seized. A truck loaded with bricks from Dongjiaominxiang to Tiananmen Square had people shouting, "Chinese people, come up and smash the PLA."

At dawn, the atrocities of beating and killing soldiers of the People's Liberation Army reached a horrifying level. An ambulance from the armed police's first detachment, carrying eight injured soldiers to a nearby hospital, was intercepted by a group of rioters, and one was beaten to death on the spot, with the rioters shouting to beat the remaining seven to death. In front of a bicycle shop on Qianmen Street, three soldiers of the People's Liberation Army were beaten and seriously injured, and the rioters surrounded them, shouting, "Whoever dares to save them will be beaten to death." On Chang'an Street, a military vehicle stopped, and more than a hundred rioters rushed up, smashed open the driver's cabin, and beat the driver to death. East of Xidan Crossroads, 30 meters away, a soldier was beaten to death, and gasoline was poured on the corpse and burned. At Fuchengmen, a soldier was brutally murdered by rioters, and the corpse was hung on the railing of the flyover. At Chongwenmen, a soldier was pulled onto the overpass by a group of rioters, thrown down, poured with gasoline, and burned to death, with the rioters shouting, "This is a sky lantern." Near the Capital Cinema on Xichang'an Street, a soldier of the People's Liberation Army was beaten to death by rioters, disemboweled, and his eyes gouged out, with the corpse hung on a burning military vehicle. Another soldier of the People's Liberation Army had his eyes gouged out, his genitals cut off, and the corpse thrown into the moat.

Since the rebellion, according to incomplete statistics, more than 450 military vehicles, police vehicles, and public buses were smashed and burned, including more than 180 military vehicles, more than 40 armored vehicles, more than 90 police vehicles, more than 80 public buses, and more than 40 other vehicles. A batch of weapons and ammunition were seized. Thousands of injured martial law troops, armed police, and public security officers, and more than a hundred deaths. They sacrificed their blood and even their precious lives to defend the republic, the constitution, and the people. Their merits will be forever remembered by the people.

Such heavy losses most powerfully illustrate the extreme tolerance and restraint shown by the martial law troops. Otherwise, how could the troops have caused such heavy casualties and losses? Does this not show that our army is a people's army, willing to sacrifice itself to protect the people? However, to quickly suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion and avoid greater losses, the martial law troops, in the face of severe casualties, unbearable situations, and great difficulties in advancing, had no choice but to fire to clear the way and counterattack, killing some rampaging rioters. Due to the presence of many onlookers and students at the scene, some were hit by vehicles, trampled by the crowd, or struck by stray bullets. More than a thousand people were injured, and more than a hundred died in the rebellion, which is something no one wants to see. The government, martial law troops, and the families of the victims share the same feelings and will do a good job in the aftermath.

4. There is a widespread rumor that after the martial law troops entered the city, they "bloodily suppressed Tiananmen." This is completely a rumor.

The actual situation is that after the martial law troops entered the square, at 1:30 AM, the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the martial law command issued an emergency notice: "A serious counter-revolutionary rebellion occurred in the capital tonight. The rioters brazenly attacked the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, seized military weapons, burned military vehicles, set up roadblocks, kidnapped soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, and attempted to overthrow the People's Republic of China and overthrow the socialist system. The People's Liberation Army has maintained high restraint for many days, but now it must resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Citizens of the capital should comply with the martial law regulations and work closely with the People's Liberation Army to resolutely defend the constitution and protect the great socialist motherland and the safety of the capital. Those who do not heed warnings will not be able to guarantee their safety, and all consequences will be their own responsibility." This emergency notice was repeatedly broadcasted using loudspeakers for more than three hours. Most of the onlookers in the square had already quickly left. At this time, the thousands of young students who were still sitting in the square were concentrated in the south end of the square near the Monument to the People's Heroes. Around 3 AM, they sent representatives to express to the martial law troops that they were willing to withdraw from the square voluntarily, and the martial law troops welcomed this.

At 4:30 AM, the square broadcasted the notice from the martial law command: "The clearing of the square will begin now, and the call for students to withdraw from the square is agreed upon." At the same time, it broadcasted the notice from the Beijing Municipal People's Government and the martial law command on quickly restoring the normal order of Tiananmen Square. The notice said: "1. All personnel on the square must immediately leave the scene upon hearing the broadcast. 2. If anyone disobeys and refuses to comply with this notice, continues to stay on the square, the martial law troops have the right to take all measures to forcibly remove them. 3. After the clearing, Tiananmen Square will be strictly managed by the martial law troops. 4. All students and masses who have patriotic sentiments and do not want the country to be in turmoil are hoped to actively cooperate with the martial law troops to complete the clearing task."

The thousands of young students who remained on the square immediately gathered their teams, set up hand-in-hand patrol teams, and at around 5 AM, with their respective flags, began to leave the square in an orderly manner. The martial law troops opened a wide passage on the east side of the south entrance of the square, ensuring that the students left quickly, smoothly, and safely. At this time, a few students still insisted on not leaving, and the armed police, according to the "notice," forcibly removed them from the square. By 5:30 AM, the clearing task was completely finished, and the entire clearing process took less than half an hour. The students sitting in the square did not have a single death, including those who were forcibly removed at the end. The so-called "Tiananmen bloodbath" is completely nonsense.

5. Raise Awareness and Achieve Complete Victory in Suppressing the Counter-Revolutionary Rebellion

1. Correctly understand the seriousness of this counter-revolutionary rebellion and the importance of suppressing the rebellion. The small number of people who created this rebellion are those who have long stubbornly adhered to the bourgeois liberalization stance, engaged in political conspiracies, colluded with overseas and foreign hostile forces, and provided party and state core secrets to illegal organizations. In this rebellion, the main perpetrators of various acts of beating, smashing, looting, burning, and killing were mainly those who had not been reformed after serving their sentences, some political hooligan gangs, remnants of the "Gang of Four," a few bad elements hidden in illegal organizations, and other social dregs. The broad masses of the people and young students, including those who were involved to varying degrees, must draw a clear line with them and actively participate in the struggle against the rebellion.

2. In the struggle to suppress the rebellion, the broad cadres and masses should, under the leadership of the party and government in their respective regions, departments, and units, organize better, strengthen joint defense, do a good job in protecting factories, stations, schools, and ensuring the safety of their units, and actively assist the People's Liberation Army in restoring traffic order, maintaining social order, and completing various martial law tasks. In the process of suppressing the rebellion, many people have shown high political awareness. Some actively protected the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who were being chased; some promptly handed over lost weapons and ammunition to the public security and security departments; some actively propagated to the masses, clarified rumors, and did work to stabilize people's minds; some actively reported and exposed the crimes of the rioters; some bravely stood up and fought face-to-face with the rioters. This spirit is very precious.

3. The broad masses of the people and young students should think carefully about those absurd rumors and not be easily deceived. During the martial law period, they must strictly comply with the martial law regulations and absolutely not be curious and gather to watch, let alone follow the crowd and cause more casualties.

4. Enhance the awareness of the enemy, closely monitor the movements of a small number of rioters, and timely grasp their criminal facts, while reporting to the government and unit leaders to expose and assist the government in quickly apprehending these rioters and severely punishing them according to law. Now, some rioters are still continuing to burn military vehicles and public buses; some rioters are using seized weapons to shoot at soldiers and the masses; the illegal "High Autonomous Federation" is still distributing leaflets, inciting nationwide strikes, work stoppages, and market closures. Their crimes must be resolutely suppressed.

5. The relevant departments have announced: those who did bad things during the rebellion should quickly surrender and confess to seek lenient treatment. If they do not repent and continue to do evil, they will be severely punished.

　　北京发生反革命暴乱的事实真相
    中共北京市委宣传部（一九八九年六月五日）
    ６月３日、４日，首都北京在经历了一个多月的动乱之后，发生了一场骇人听闻的反革命暴乱。依靠人民解放军戒严部队的官兵和武警官兵、公安干警的英勇斗争，依靠广大人民的配合和支持，已经取得了平息暴乱的初步胜利。但是，这场反革命暴乱现在还没有完全平息。极少数暴乱分子还在那里阴谋策划，制造谣言，蛊惑人心，进行反扑。他们利用抢来的枪支弹药，打黑枪、烧汽车、砸岗亭、冲击商店和公共场所，企图垂死挣扎。目前，社会上有种种传闻，许多群众对事实真相还不够了解，思想上和感情上都有些问题没有解决。因此，有必要把这场反革命暴乱的真相向群众讲清楚，使大家明了事情的来龙去脉，认清平息这场暴乱的必要性和紧迫性，积极投入斗争，为稳定首都局势做贡献。
    一、有的同志提出，前几天动乱的局势已有所缓和，戒严部队还有必要进城吗？
    应当明确，执行国务院戒严令，完成首都部分地区的戒严任务，部队必须进城。事实上，从５月２０日发布戒严令之日起，戒严部队每天都在按照预定部署，采取不同方式向城里开进，到达指定部位。正是因为戒严部队的陆续进驻和各方面的艰苦努力，动乱的局势才开始向着缓和的方向发展。但是，必须尖锐指出，极少数人制造动乱的活动一天也没有停止，推翻共产党领导的目标丝毫也没有改变。
    他们声称，已经内定了“新政府”的成员，准备了要镇压的干部名单，继续在天安门广场静坐，不断制造事端，可以达到“推翻现政府，建立新政府”的目的。
    他们积极组织力量，纠集流氓地痞，网罗对共产党和社会主义制度有刻骨仇恨的人，拼凑所谓“飞虎队”、“义勇军”、“敢死队”，扬言要“软禁”党和国家领导人，要用“攻打巴士底狱的方式”夺取政权。
    他们用海外反动政治势力援助的资金和物资，准备长期占据天安门广场，开办了“民主大学”，声称这是“新时期的黄埔军校”。
    他们在人民英雄纪念碑前竖起了一个什么女神像，原来叫“自由女神”，后来又改名为“民主之神”，要用美国的自由民主来作为他们的精神支柱。
    他们说，“要用广场的斗争，来支持全国的斗争”，采取极其恶劣的手段，威胁青年学生，不许撤离广场，甚至扬言，“谁要撤就干掉谁”。
    他们生怕青年学生静坐请愿的行动难以坚持，又动员搞５０００人的“知识分子大绝食”，但号召不起来，结果搞了一个仅４人参加的４８小时至７２小时的绝食闹剧。
    他们散发煽动反革命武装暴乱的传单，鼓吹“星星之火，可以燎原”，叫嚷要组成“武装力量”，“团结包括台湾国民党在内的各种力量”，“不惜抛头颅，洒热血，旗帜鲜明地反对共产党和它的政府”。
    所有这些说明，极少数人有计划、有预谋制造的动乱，绝不像善良的人们想象的那样正在趋向平息，而是改头换面，继续在那里同我们作拚死的斗争。
    他们深知，戒严部队一旦全部到位，广大群众进一步动员和组织起来，他们的阴谋就将落空。于是，伺机挑起事端，使动乱激化。
    ６月１日，我公安机关收审了非法组织“工自联”的几个头头，他们就借机煽动一些人，包围和冲击了北京市公安局，市委、市政府机关和公安部。
    ６月２日晚，中央电视台借用了１０个月的武警部队的一辆吉普车，在返回原单位途中，由于车速过快，路面有水打滑，造成翻车事故，撞死３人，重伤１人，没有一个是学生。这本来是一起交通事故，有关部门已在处理，但是，极少数人却有意把它同戒严部队按计划进城的行动联系起来，大造谣言，说是戒严部队的开道车故意轧死学生，鼓动不明真相的人，要抢夺尸体，举行抬棺大游行。一时间，人心浮动，气氛极为紧张。经过这两天的煽动和鼓噪，暴乱的火就被他们点了起来。
    二、有的同志问，６月３日这一天发生的事情，够得上是暴乱吗？
    这个问题，最好还是让事实来回答。
    ６月３日凌晨，当戒严部队按既定计划继续进入警戒目标的过程中，就有人大呼小叫，煽动一些人在建国门、南河沿、西单、木樨地等路口阻拦大小车辆，设置路障，拦截军车，殴打战士，抢夺军用物资。
    １时许，鲁各庄附近１２辆军车被拦，从燕京饭店门前经过的战士被强行搜身，电报大楼前的军车轮胎被扎穿，并被隔离墩围住。
    拂晓前后，永定门桥头的军车被推翻，木樨地的军车车胎被扎穿，朝阳门的４００多名进城的战士被歹徒用石块乱砸，六部口、横二条一带军车被拦截，战士被围困。
    早上７时前后，有的歹徒钻进被围困在六部口的军车内，抢夺装有子弹的机枪。从建国门到东单，以及天桥附近，进城部队被零星隔断，遭到围攻、殴打。在建国门立交桥上，有些战士的衣服被扒光，有的战士被打得痛哭。
    上午，虎坊桥一带的进城部队被冲，战士遭痛打，有的被打瞎了眼睛。有些被打伤的战士在被送往医院途中被人拦截，急救车被放气，伤员被绑架。虎坊路至陶然亭２１辆军车被围，在战士转移弹药时，前往护卫的民警被打伤。
    中午，被拦阻在府右街南口、正义路北口、宣武门、虎坊桥、木樨地、东四等路口的解放军战士，有的被打伤，有的钢盔，军帽、雨衣、水壶、挎包被抢。有的路口，压缩饼干、罐头等撒满一地。六部口一伙人截了一辆满载枪支弹药的军车，武警部队和公安干警多次解围均未成功。这车枪支弹药如被抢走或发生爆炸，后果不堪设想。为了保护首都人民生命财产安全，在万不得已的情况下，武警部队施放了催泪弹，抢回了弹药车。在这时，有的学生受伤，随即送往医院治疗。
    与此同时，一伙暴徒开始围堵和冲击国家机关和重要部位。他们冲人民大会堂，冲中宣部，冲广播电视部，冲中南海的西门和南门。保卫这些机关的武警战士和公安干警数十人负伤。
    随着事态的急剧恶化，暴乱的挑动者也更加猖狂。下午５时许，非法组织“高自联”和“工自联”的少数人，向天安门广场不明真相的群众分发了菜刀、匕首、铁棍、铁链子和带尖的竹竿，声言“抓住军警就要往死里打”。“工自联”在广播中大肆叫嚣，要“拿起武器推翻政府”。还有一伙暴徒纠集了上千人，推倒西单附近一个建筑工地的围墙，抢走大批施工工具和钢筋、砖块等，准备打巷战。
    请大家看看，这不是暴乱是什么？在这紧急关头，党中央、国务院、中央军委下定决心，命令驻守在首都城区周围的戒严部队，强行开进，平息暴乱。
    三、有的同志问，部队进城平息暴乱，为什么向老百姓开枪？
    自戒严以来，陆续进城的戒严部队始终保持高度克制的态度，尽量避免发生冲突，这是有目共睹的。６月３日暴乱发生后，大部队进城前，为了避免伤害群众，北京市人民政府和戒严部队指挥部于晚６时半发出《紧急通告》，要求“全体市民要提高警惕，从现在起，请你们不要上街去，不要到天安门广场去。广大职工要坚守岗位，市民要留在家里，以保证你们的生命安全。”这个《通告》，通过电台、电视台和各种广播器，进行了反复广播。
    ６月３日晚１０时前后，奉命向城内开进的各路戒严部队先后进入市区。但在各主要路口，都受到了严重阻拦。即便在这种情况下，部队仍然采取了极其克制的态度。而少数暴徒却利用这种克制发动骇人听闻的打、砸、抢、烧、杀。
    ２２点到２３点，从翠微路、公主坟、木樨地到西单一线，有１２辆军车被烧。有些人用卡车运来砖头，向战士猛砍。一些暴徒把无轨电车推到路口，放火燃烧，阻断了道路。有的消防车赶去灭火，也被砸烂、烧毁。
    ２３点前后，虎坊桥３辆军车被砸，１辆吉普车被推翻。安定门立交桥军车被围堵，崇文门大街一个团的战士被围堵，建国门立交桥３０辆军车被围堵，北京煤炭工业学校以西３００多辆军车被围堵。为保证军车前进，有的战士和指挥员下车做疏导工作，被围攻殴打，有些被强行绑架，不知去向。在南苑三营门受阻的军车，为避免冲突，往东绕行，至天坛南门再次被堵，许多军车被砸、被烧。珠市口一辆军车被堵，一帮人爬到车上，下边一个干部模样的人劝他们下来，当即被痛打，生死不明。
    ６月４日凌晨以后，焚烧军车情况愈演愈烈。在天坛东侧路、天坛北门、前门地铁西口、前门东路、府右街、六部口、西单、复兴门、南礼士路、木樨地、莲花池、车公庄、东华门、东直门，以及朝阳区的大北窑、呼家楼、北豆各庄，大兴县旧宫乡等地，数十个路口的数百辆军车，被暴徒用汽油、燃烧瓶和土制喷火器引燃，火光冲天，有的战士在车内被活活烧死，有的跳下车后被活活打死。有的地方几辆、十几辆，甚至二三十辆同时被烧，一片火海。在双井路口，有７０余辆装甲车被围，其中２０余辆车上的机枪被暴徒拆掉。京原路口至老山骨灰堂以西，３０多辆军车被暴徒付之一炬，现场浓烟冲天。有的暴徒手持铁棍，推着汽油桶，在路口堵截，见车被烧，车上战士鸣枪警告，暴徒也置之不理。有几名暴徒在复兴门立交桥一带，开着抢来的装甲车，边行进边开枪。非法的“工自联”还在广播上宣称，他们缴获了一部军用电台和密码本。还有多辆军用运粮车、被服车被暴徒抢劫，不知去向。
    一些暴徒趁机大搞打砸抢。西城区的燕山等商店的橱窗被砸。一伙人点燃了毛主席纪念堂西侧的松树墙。一些公共电汽车、消防车、救护车、出租汽车被砸毁和烧毁。特别恶毒的是，一伙人将一辆公共汽车推到天安门城洞下点燃，企图烧毁天安门城楼，被及时扑灭。
    在猛烈攻击军车和大搞打、砸、抢、烧的同时，残杀解放军战士的暴行接连发生，手段极其残忍。
    ６月４日凌晨，东单路口一伙暴徒用酒瓶、砖头、自行车砸砍战士，许多战士血流满面。复兴门一辆车被截，车上的某部管理科长、管理员、炊事员等１２人被拉下车来，强行搜身，然后痛打，多人受重伤。六部口４名战士被围攻殴打，有的当场死亡。广渠门附近３名战士被痛打，只有一名被群众救出，两名下落不明。在西城区西兴盛胡同有２０余名武警战士被一伙歹徒堵住，有的被打成重伤，有的下落不明。护国寺一辆军车被截，战士被拉下来痛打后当作人质，一批冲锋枪被抢走。一辆装满砖头的汽车，由东交民巷开往天安门广场，车上的人高喊：“是中国人的上来，砸解放军去。”
    拂晓之后，打、杀解放军战士的暴行达到令人发指的地步。武警一支队的一辆救护车，拉了８名受伤的战士送往附近医院时，被一伙暴徒拦住，当场就打死一名，还叫嚷要把其余的７名一齐打死。在前门大街的一家自行车店门前，有３名解放军战士被打负重伤，暴徒们围住狂叫：“谁敢救他们就打死谁。”在长安街上，一辆军车息火，一二百名暴徒一涌而上，砸开驾驶室，将司机活活砸死。西单十字路口以东３０米处，一名战士被打死，又在尸体上浇汽油焚烧。在阜成门，一名战士被暴徒残害后，尸体被悬挂在立交桥的栏杆上。在崇文门，一名战士被一伙暴徒拉上过街天桥，从桥上扔下，浇上汽油，活活烧死，暴徒们狂叫，这是“点天灯”。在西长安街首都电影院附近，一名解放军军官被暴徒打死后，剖腹挖眼，把尸体挂在一辆正在燃烧的军车上。还有一名解放军被挖掉眼珠，割掉生殖器，将尸体扔进护城河。
    暴乱以来，据不完全统计，被暴徒砸毁、烧毁的军车、警车和公共汽车达４５０多辆，其中军用汽车１８０多辆，装甲车４０多辆，警车９０多辆，公共电汽车８０多辆，其它机动车４０多辆。抢走一批武器、弹药。负伤的戒严部队战士、武警战士、公安干警数千人，死亡上百人。他们为保卫共和国，保卫宪法，保卫人民，付出了鲜血甚至宝贵的生命。对他们的功绩，人民将永远铭记。
    如此惨重的代价，最有力地说明了戒严部队所采取的极大的容忍和克制态度。否则，部队怎么可能造成这么大的伤亡和损失呢？这难道不正说明我们的军队是人民军队，为了保护人民而不惜牺牲自己吗？但是，为了迅速平息反革命暴乱，避免造成更大的损失，戒严部队在伤亡严重、忍无可忍、让无可让而又很难前进的情况下，迫不得已鸣枪开道，进行反击，击毙了一些肆虐的暴徒。由于围观的群众和在场的学生很多，有的被车撞、人挤，有的被流弹击中，暴乱中有上千群众受伤，上百人死亡，这是大家都不愿看到的事情。对于被误伤的群众和学生，政府、戒严部队和受害者家属的心情是一样的，要做好善后工作。
    四、社会上盛传，戒严部队进城之后，“血洗天安门”。这完全是谣言。
    真实情况是，戒严部队进入广场之后，凌晨１时半，北京市人民政府和戒严部队指挥部发出紧急通告：“首都今晚发生了严重的反革命暴乱。暴徒们猖狂袭击解放军指战员，抢军火，烧军车，设路障，绑架解放军官兵，妄想颠覆中华人民共和国，推翻社会主义制度。人民解放军多日来保持了高度克制，现在必须坚决反击反革命暴乱。首都公民要遵守戒严令规定，并同解放军密切配合，坚决捍卫宪法，保卫伟大的社会主义祖国和首都的安全。凡不听劝告的，将无法保证其安全，一切后果完全由自己负责。”这个紧急通告用高音喇叭，进行了反复播放，时间长达３个多钟头。在广场围观的群众，多数都已迅速离开。这时，停留在广场上静坐的青年学生只有数千人，集中在广场南端人民英雄纪念碑一带。３时左右，他们派出代表向戒严部队表示，愿意自动撤出广场，戒严部队表示欢迎。
    凌晨４时半，广场上广播了戒严部队指挥部的通知：“现在开始清场，同意同学们撤离广场的呼吁。”同时，广播了北京市人民政府和戒严部队指挥部关于迅速恢复天安门广场的正常秩序的通告。通告说：“一、凡在广场上的所有人员听到广播必须立即撤离现场。二、如果有人违抗和拒不执行此通告，仍继续滞留广场，戒严部队有权采取一切手段予以强行处置。三、清场后，天安门广场由戒严部队严格管理。四、希望一切有爱国之心，不愿意国家动乱的广大学生和群众，要积极配合戒严部队执行好清场任务。”
    停留在广场上的数千名青年学生听到通告后，立即集结了队伍，布置了手拉手的纠察队，于５时左右，打着各自的旗子开始有秩序地离开广场。戒严部队在广场东侧南口开出了一条宽阔的通道，保证了学生迅速、顺利、平安地离开。这时，还有少数学生坚持不走，武警战士按照“通告”要求，强制他们离开了广场。到５时半，清场任务全部完成，整个清场过程用了不到半小时，广场静坐的学生没有死一个人，包括最后强制离开的。所谓“天安门血流成河”，完全是胡说八道。
    五、提高认识，夺取平息反革命暴乱的全胜
    １、要正确认识这场反革命暴乱的严重性和平息暴乱的重要意义。制造这场暴乱的极少数人是指的长期顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场、搞政治阴谋的人，同海外、国外敌对势力相勾结的人，向非法组织提供党和国家核心机密的人。在这场暴乱中，出面制造打、砸、抢、烧、杀等种种暴行的，主要是那些没有改造好的刑满释放分子、一些政治性的流氓团伙、“四人帮”的残渣余孽、潜藏在非法组织中的少数坏人和其他社会渣滓。广大群众和青年学生，包括不同程度卷入了的人们，一定要和他们划清界限，积极投身到这场反暴乱的斗争中来。
    ２、在平息暴乱的斗争中，广大干部、群众，应在本地区、本部门、本单位党政领导下，更好地组织起来，加强联防，做好护厂、护站、护校和保卫本单位安全的工作，同时，积极协助人民解放军恢复交通秩序，维护社会治安，完成各项戒严任务。在平息暴乱的过程中，许多群众表现了很高的政治觉悟，他们有的积极保护被追打的解放军战士；有的及时向公安、保卫部门送交失散的枪支弹药；有的主动宣传群众，澄清谣言，做安定人心的工作；有的积极检举揭发暴乱分子的罪行；有的挺身而出，同暴徒进行面对面的斗争。这种精神是十分可贵的。
    ３、广大群众和青年学生，对那些荒诞离奇的谣言，要动脑筋好好想一想，不要轻信上当。在戒严期间，一定要严格遵守戒严令，千万不要好奇围观，更不要跟着起哄，避免再发生意外的伤亡。
    ４、要增强敌情观念，密切注视极少数暴乱分子的动向，随时掌握他们的犯罪事实，同时向政府和本单位领导检举揭发，协助政府尽快地将这些暴乱分子捉拿归案，依法严惩。现在，一些暴徒仍在继续焚烧军车和公共电汽车；一些暴徒用抢到的武器在那里放冷枪，杀伤战士和群众；非法组织“高自联”还在散发传单，煽动全国总罢课、总罢工、总罢市。对他们的罪行，必须予以坚决的打击。
    ５、有关部门已经宣布：在暴乱中干了坏事的人，要赶快投案自首，争取宽大处理。如果不思悔改，继续作恶，一定从严惩办。
