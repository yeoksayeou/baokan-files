The Current Financial Situation

Reporter: Honorable Director Rong, please introduce the current financial situation.

Rong Feng'e: This year, due to the further implementation of the tight monetary policy by banks at all levels, some positive situations have emerged. By the end of April, not only was the large amount of currency issued before the Spring Festival fully withdrawn, but an additional 6.5 billion yuan was also withdrawn. In the first quarter, urban and rural savings deposits nationwide increased by 31.8 billion yuan, 3.8 billion yuan more than the same period last year. Enterprise deposits began to reverse the trend of continuous decline over the past few months, increasing by 7.1 billion yuan in March. The deposit and payment capabilities of various specialized banks have improved compared to the first two months of this year and the same period last year.

Reporter: I feel that the aforementioned figures are not sufficient to indicate an improvement in the financial situation this spring, because last year China's net currency issuance was very high, so naturally more will be recovered this spring.

Rong: Yes, in the first quarter of this year, in absolute terms, the net withdrawal of currency was indeed higher than the same period last year. However, a large amount of currency issued last year is still circulating in the market. This will inevitably put strong pressure on the market this year. In recent years, generally, if the net issuance of currency increases by 100 yuan in the previous year, 26.7 yuan of currency will be withdrawn in the first quarter of the following year, but this year only 5.1 yuan was withdrawn.

The situation for the central bank in the first quarter is also not good. Last year, the central bank lent a lot to specialized banks, and this year, in the first half of the year, more should have been recovered, but in the first quarter, not only was more not recovered, but 900 million yuan less was recovered compared to the same period last year.

According to normal rules, every spring, specialized banks should deposit a portion of the loans they recover as reserves with the central bank. The central bank generally does not lend to specialized banks. However, the situation this year is abnormal. Since the beginning of the year, almost every month, the central bank has had to increase loans to support production, which has never happened in history.

Reporter: Since the spring, the collection of agricultural and sideline products has again resulted in the issuance of IOUs, and large and medium-sized enterprises have also complained of "blood shortage." Many people attribute this situation to the tightening of monetary policy being too severe. However, from the situation you just introduced, it seems that the monetary policy has not been truly tightened yet.

Rong: Yes.

Reporter: Why?

Rong: Natural disasters have been frequent this spring, especially in many provinces where large-scale pests and diseases have occurred, requiring a large amount of pesticides. Enterprises producing pesticides lack funds and raw materials and need bank support, so loans cannot be withheld.

Reporter: If the monetary policy is not tightened, large and medium-sized enterprises, the collection of agricultural and sideline products, and foreign trade exports are all in urgent need. If the monetary policy is relaxed, it will be difficult to ensure that the price increase index this year is significantly lower than last year. Isn't this a dilemma?

Rong: If we do not take effective measures, we will fall into the dilemma you mentioned.

The Causes of Tight Working Capital

Reporter: Director Rong, since the central bank has not tightened loans, why is the working capital of enterprises so tight?

Rong: The fundamental reason is that the high investment and consumption demands have not been significantly reduced, and the industrial structure has not been effectively adjusted, resulting in a large amount of working capital being stagnant and a large loss, making the loan structure even more irrational.

Reporter: Can you talk about the prominent problems that have emerged from the two expansions this year?

Rong: The prominent problems this year are: first, many places and enterprises are hoarding scarce materials, occupying a large amount of loans, making it difficult to reduce loans that should be reduced. According to our investigation and calculation, the agricultural and sideline products that should have been sold but have not been sold nationwide occupy about 15 billion yuan of funds. According to the statistics of the Industrial and Commercial Bank on more than 40,000 state-owned industrial enterprises, the scarce steel materials in the market have accumulated in production, materials, supply, and marketing enterprises, equivalent to more than 200 days of national consumption. So many commodities and working capital are blocked in the circulation, unable to continue to be used for turnover, how can the working capital not be tight? Second, a large amount of working capital is squeezed and misappropriated. The most prominent is the loss of misappropriation. Since last year, some enterprises have used the appreciation of inventory caused by price increases as operating income and distributed it, not using it to supplement their own working capital as stipulated by the state. However, the increased expenditure due to the rise in raw material prices is hung on the account, and the costs that should be allocated are not allocated, forming a situation of apparent profit but actual loss.

In addition to the loss of misappropriation by enterprises, there is also misappropriation by the fiscal department. Many enterprises also misappropriate working capital for basic construction, staff welfare, and staff borrowing. According to a typical survey and calculation, about 15-20% of the funds for grain and cotton procurement are misappropriated for other uses.

Third, the "external circulation" of funds and cash is developing rapidly. After tightening the monetary policy, many places and enterprises have turned to various forms of fundraising to obtain the funds they need. Moreover, the investment direction of "external circulation" funds is mostly used to expand fixed asset investment, used for enterprises that the state's industrial policy wants to limit and close, and enterprises that should be given priority support, especially large and medium-sized enterprises, still need the bank to continue to support loans in this situation, which has exacerbated the supply and demand contradiction of working capital.

Reporter: Are the current phenomena of large-scale hoarding by industrial and commercial enterprises and short-term behavior of enterprises related to the following situations: such as the current unclear property rights of enterprises, and some administrative departments adopting too many administrative measures during the rectification and adjustment, causing market blockage and obstruction?

Rong: Yes, the above three reasons are direct reasons, but the deeper reasons are the mechanism problems you mentioned.

Measures to Be Taken

Reporter: The current financial situation is so severe, what measures do you think should be taken to solve it?

Rong: I think to get out of the current situation, we must first solve a problem of awareness. Now many people think that controlling inflation mainly depends on whether the bank can control the currency issuance. In fact, the fundamental problem lies in the incompleteness of the current economic system reform, especially the irrationality of the industrial and credit structures caused by this incompleteness. Because of this incompleteness and irrationality, it is difficult for us to achieve this: tightening the monetary policy while not affecting the effective supply. Thus, it also affects the tightening of the monetary policy.

Reporter: This is also the fundamental reason why credit has repeatedly appeared as "control and die, release and expand" in recent years.

Rong: From the reasons for the tight working capital this year, you should see that if the commercial and fiscal departments strictly control the loss of funds and solve the problem of fund stagnation, the loans issued by the central bank this year are completely sufficient, and the situation of tight working capital should not occur. Therefore, to change the current financial situation, relying on the bank alone to sing a "solo" is difficult to achieve, and it is necessary for local governments and all sectors of society to work together to carry out comprehensive management.

Reporter: Can you specifically talk about the specific comprehensive management measures to be taken at present?

Rong: From the bank's side, we believe that it is appropriate to adjust the deposit and loan interest rates in a timely manner, develop urban and rural savings, control the loss of funds, suppress external circulation. As for other aspects, the State Council should immediately take effective measures to solve the problems of hoarding, misappropriation, and occupation, and while taking administrative measures, it is more important to take economic measures, further activate enterprises and the market, accelerate the turnover of funds, and increase effective supply. The summer grain procurement season is approaching, and all levels of departments should make early preparations.

    金融形势不容乐观　银行呼吁综合治理
    ——访中国人民银行资金管理司司长荣凤娥
    本报记者　张锦力
    面临的金融形势
    记者（下简称记）：荣司长，请您介绍一下当前的金融形势。
    荣凤娥（下简称荣）：今年由于各级银行进一步贯彻执行紧缩银根的方针，出现了一些较好的情况，到4月底，不但春节前大量投放的货币全部回笼，还净回笼货币65亿元。一季度全国城乡储蓄存款增加318亿元，比去年同期多增加38亿元。企业存款开始改变连续几个月下降的局面，3月份增加71亿元。各家专业银行的存款支付能力，比今年前两个月和去年同期相比都有增强。
    记：我觉得上述数字不能足以说明今春的金融形势好转，因为去年我国货币净投放量很高，今春自然会多收回一些。
    荣：是的，今年一季度，从绝对额看，货币净回笼是比去年同期增加了。但仍有大量的去年投放的票子滞留在流通中。这必将对今年的市场形成很强的压力。近几年，一般凡头年增加百元货币净投放，次年一季度有26.7元货币回笼进来，而今年一季度只回笼5.10元。
    今年一季度中央银行回笼情况也不太好。去年中央银行对专业银行贷款增加很多，今年上半年本应多收回些，但今年一季度不但没有多收回，还比去年同期少收9亿元。
    按正常规律，每年春季，各专业银行要将收回的贷款一部分，作为准备金交给中央银行。中央银行一般不向专业银行贷款。然而，今年情况反常。从年初开始，几乎每个月都要依靠中央银行增加贷款来支持生产，这在历史上是从未有过的。
    记：今春以来，农副产品收购再次出现打白条现象，大中型企业也因“缺血”而发出抱怨。许多人把这种情况看成是紧缩银根过头造成的。可是从你刚才介绍情况来看，到目前为止，银根并未真正收紧。
    荣：是的。
    记：为什么？
    荣：今春的自然灾害频繁，尤其是许多省份发生了大面积的病虫害，急需大量农药。生产农药的企业缺乏资金、原料，要银行支持，贷款不能不发放。
    记：现在银根还没有收紧，大中型企业，农副产品的收购，外贸出口频频告急，如果放松银根，就很难保证今年物价上涨指数明显低于去年。这不是处于两难境地吗？
    荣：如果我们不采取切实有效的措施，就会陷入你所说的
  两难境地。
                  流动资金紧张的原因
    记：荣司长，既然中央银行没有收紧贷款，为什么企业的
  流动资金会相当紧张呢？
    荣：根本原因是过高的投资需求和消费需求没有明显的压缩，产业结构没有得到有效调整，造成了流动资金沉淀多，流
  失大，贷款结构更加不合理。
    记：你能不能谈谈今年两个膨胀所出现的突出问题？
    荣：今年出现的突出问题：一是许多地方和企业囤积紧俏物资，占用大量贷款，使该降的贷款降不下来。据我们的调查
  测算，全国该调出销售而未调出销售的农副产品就占用了资金
  150亿元左右。据工商银行对4万余户国营工业企业的统计，市场短缺的钢材，在生产、物资、供销等企业都积存了相当于全国200
  多天的消费量。这么多的商品物资和流动资金梗塞在流通中，
  不能继续周转使用，流动资金怎么会不紧张呢？二是流动资金
  大量被挤占挪用。比较突出的是亏损占用。去年以来一些企业
  把物价上涨引起库存的升值，作为经营收入分掉了，不按国家规定用于补充自有流动资金。而原材料涨价增加的支出却挂在
  帐上，该摊的费用不摊，形成虚盈实亏。
    除企业亏损性挪用，还有财政上的挪用。还有不少企业挪
  用流动资金去搞基本建设、职工福利和职工借支。据典型调查
  测算，粮棉收购资金中约有15—20％挪作了它用。
      三是资金和现金的“体外循环”发展很快，紧缩银根后，
  许多地方和企业转为采取各种形式的集资来取得他们所需的资
  金。而且，“体外循环”资金投向，多是用于扩大固定资产投
  资，用于国家产业政策所要限制、停关的企业，应优先支持的企业，特别是大中型企业，仍然要银行继续贷款支持这种状况，加剧了流动资金的供求矛盾。
    记：目前所出现的工商企业大量囤积，企业短期化行为，是不是与这些情况有关：如现在企业产权关系不明，一些行政部门在治理整顿中过多采取行政手段，造成市场封锁和不畅。
    荣：是的，上述三个原因是直接原因，但更深层的原因，是你所提到的机制问题。
                  应采取的措施
    记：目前金融形势这么严峻，你认为应采取哪些措施加以解决？
    荣：我觉得要摆脱目前这种局面，首先要解决一个认识问题。现在许多人认为治理通货膨胀，主要在于银行能否控制住货币发行量。其实根本问题还在于现行经济体制改革的不彻底，特别是这种不彻底所带来的产业结构和信贷结构的不合理。因为这种不彻底和不合理的情况，使我们很难做到这一点：既收紧了银根，又不影响有效供应。于是，也就影响了收紧银根。
    记：这也就是为什么这几年信贷上反复出现“一控就死，一放就胀”的根本原因。
    荣：从今年流动资金紧张的原因中，你应该看到，如果工商部门、财政部门严格控制资金流失，解决好资金的沉淀问题，今年中央银行发放的贷款是完全够用的，不应出现流动资金紧张的状况。所以要改变目前的金融状况，光靠银行一家唱“独角戏”是难以奏效的，需要各地政府和社会各方面齐抓共管，进行综合治理。
    记：你能否具体谈谈当前采取哪些具体的综合治理措施？
    荣：从银行方面，我们认为适时调整存贷款利率，发展城乡储蓄，控制资金的沉淀流失，抑制体外循环，至于其它方面，国务院应立即采取有效措施，解决囤积、挪用、挤占等行为，在采取行政手段同时，更重要的还是采取经济手段，进一步搞活企业和市场，加速资金周转，增加有效供给。夏粮收购季节已到，各级部门应及早准备。
