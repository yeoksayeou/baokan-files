The State Council for National Defense Science, Technology, and Industry recently held a meeting with leaders from the mechanical and electrical, aerospace, shipbuilding, nuclear, and ordnance sectors, as well as from various defense industry corporations. The meeting emphasized the need to make up for the losses caused by the turmoil and counter-revolutionary rebellion, ensuring the full completion of this year's defense research, production, and foreign trade tasks.

Ding Henggao, the Minister of the State Council for National Defense Science, Technology, and Industry, presided over the meeting. Leaders from various departments spoke at the meeting. The meeting noted that although the total industrial output value of national defense science and technology for the first five months of this year reached 38% of the annual target, with both output value and profits increasing simultaneously, the recent domestic turmoil has made the already tight supply of funds, energy, raw materials, components, and transportation even more challenging. Fully completing this year's defense research, production, and foreign trade tasks will be quite arduous.

The current primary task for national defense science and technology is to focus on key research and production, especially ensuring the completion of key models of new weapons and equipment urgently needed for combat. Funds, energy, raw materials, and transportation should be prioritized for enterprises undertaking key tasks and those with good economic benefits.

The meeting emphasized that national defense science and technology must adhere to the principles of self-reliance and hard work, as well as the policy of reform and opening up. On the basis of equality and mutual benefit, active cooperation should be pursued with other countries. The attempts by a few countries' governments to pressure us by stopping technological and economic exchanges will only make us more determined to strengthen our spirit of self-reliance and hard work.

The meeting called for further development of military technology for civilian use and civilian product production. This year, the output value of civilian products in the defense industry accounted for 67.8% of the total industrial output value in the first half of the year. The focus should be on developing civilian products that are technology-intensive, have high added value, and ensure effective supply.

　　国防工业部门负责人会议强调    
    确保完成国防科研生产外贸任务
    新华社北京６月２３日电（记者许志敏）国防科工委日前召开机电、航空航天、船舶、核、兵器等军工部门和总公司负责人会议，强调将动乱和反革命暴乱造成的损失夺回来，确保今年国防科研、生产和外贸任务全面完成。
    国防科工委主任丁衡高主持了这次会议，各部门负责同志在会上发了言。会议认为，虽然今年１至５月份完成了全年国防科技工业总产值的３８％，产值与利润同步增长，但由于前一段时间国内的动乱，导致本来就很紧张的资金、能源、原材料配套件、交通运输等更加困难，全面完成今年国防科研、生产和外贸等任务相当艰巨。
    当前国防科技工业的首要任务是抓好重点科研生产，特别是确保新型武器装备的重点型号、作战急需装备的完成。资金、能源、原材料、运输要优先保证承担重点任务和经济效益好的企业。
    会议认为，国防科技工业必须坚持自力更生、艰苦奋斗，坚持改革开放的方针，在平等互利的基础上积极开展与各国的合作，极少数国家政府企图用停止技术和经济交往来压我们，只能促使我们更加振奋自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神。
    会议要求进一步开展军工技术转民用和民品生产工作。今年上半年国防工业民品产值已占工业总产值的６７．８％，要重点发展技术密集、附加价值高、保证有效供给的民品。
