The Chafang District of Zhangjiakou City in Hebei Province has implemented the "Four Guarantees" responsibility system to ensure the effective implementation of the Compulsory Education Law. This has transformed the previous situation where the education department was fighting alone, leading to a societal enthusiasm for education. Last year, the district achieved a 100% enrollment rate for primary schools, a 99% retention rate, a 93% promotion rate, and a 100% graduation rate. For middle schools, the retention rate was 93% and the promotion rate was 70%.

The "Four Guarantees" are as follows:

- Parents guarantee enrollment. Parents who do not send their school-age children to school on time are fined 50 yuan in educational funds, and are required to send their children to school within a specified period. For parents who encourage their children to drop out of school, the school will notify them to send their children back to school within a week. If they fail to do so, they will be fined 2 yuan per day until the student returns to school. The district committee and government have designated March as the month for checking enrollment retention rates and September as the month for checking enrollment rates, promptly correcting any issues that arise.

- Townships and villages guarantee school conditions. The district committee and government have included improving school conditions as an important indicator in the term targets for township and village officials. They hold an education work meeting every quarter and an annual education work conference, linking education indicators to the salaries of village officials. Over the past three years, the district has raised 1.75 million yuan through various channels, such as collective contributions, enterprise support, and public donations, to improve school conditions. The district has built and renovated 14,819 square meters of school buildings and repaired 4,460 square meters of existing buildings.

- Schools guarantee teaching quality. All primary and secondary schools in the district have shifted their focus from merely pursuing high promotion rates to both providing qualified students for higher education and cultivating a large number of qualified personnel for local development. While systematically teaching scientific and cultural knowledge, some subjects have added local teaching materials, gradually forming a virtuous cycle where education promotes rural economic development and vice versa.

- The district education commission guarantees the improvement of teacher qualifications. In accordance with the State Education Commission's regulations on teacher qualifications, the district education commission has created conditions to encourage primary and secondary school teachers who do not meet the standards to actively participate in various forms of study, such as part-time, correspondence, and distance learning, or to take leave for further study. Currently, the qualification rate for primary school teachers is 92%, and the qualification rate for middle school teachers has increased from 23% to 40%.

　　张家口市茶坊区重视教育工作
   “四保”责任制带来办学热
    本报讯  河北省张家口市茶坊区区委、区政府为认真贯彻《义务教育法》，制定实施教育“四保”责任制，改变了过去教育部门孤军奋战的局面，出现了乡村领导“管”教育，乡村企业“帮”教育，社会各界“助”教育，教育部门“抓”教育的社会办学热。去年，全区小学入学率１００％，巩固率为９９％，升学率为９３％，毕业率为１００％；初中巩固率为９３％，升学率为７０％。
    这“四保”是：
    ——家长保入学。对没有按时送适龄子女入学的家长，罚教育金５０元，同时责令家长限期将子女送到学校；对怂恿子女中途退学的家长，由学校通知其在一周内将子女送回学校，逾期不送者，拖延一天罚款２元，直至学生返校为止。区委、区政府把每年３月定为入学巩固率检查月，把９月定为入学率检查月，发现问题及时纠正。
    ——乡村保办学条件。区委、区政府把改善办学条件作为一项重要指标，列入乡、村干部的任期目标责任制，每季召开一次教育工作例会，每年召开一次教育工作会，并把教育指标同村干部的工资挂起钩来。３年来，全区各乡村通过集体“拿一点”、企业“助一点”、群众“捐一点”等多种渠道集资１７５万多元用于改善办学条件。全区新建改建校舍１４８１９平方米；维修校舍４４６０平方米。
    ——学校保教学质量。全区各中小学把基础教育由单纯追求升学率转向既为更高一级学校输送合格新生、又为本地建设培养大批合格人才的正确轨道上来。在系统传授科学文化知识的同时，部分学科增加了乡土教材，逐步形成教育与农村经济发展互相促进的良性循环。
    ——区文教委保师资素质的提高。按照国家教委关于教师学历达标的规定，区文教委创造条件，鼓励未达标的中小学教师积极参加各类院校举办的业余、函授、刊授学习，或离职进修。目前，全区小学教师达标率为９２％；中学教师达标率由过去的２３％上升到４０％。
