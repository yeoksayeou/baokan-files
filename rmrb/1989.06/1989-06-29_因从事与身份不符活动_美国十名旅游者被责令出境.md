Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, June 29th.

Ten American tourists, including Davis, Gwendolyn Nami, were ordered to leave China for engaging in activities inconsistent with their status. The Yunnan Provincial Public Security Bureau announced yesterday that, in accordance with Article 16 of the "Law of the People's Republic of China on the Control of Entry and Exit of Aliens," the Kunming Public Security Bureau shortened their stay in China and ordered them to leave by June 30th. The 10 Americans departed on a flight to Guangzhou on the afternoon of the 27th.

Davis, Gwendolyn Nami, and the other 9 Americans entered China on June 20th and arrived in Kunming on the 21st. On the afternoon of the 23rd, they distributed religious propaganda materials in Kunming's Cuihu Park to passersby. Public security personnel immediately stopped them and confiscated 157 pieces of propaganda. Another 97 pieces that had been distributed were turned in by citizens. That evening, public security personnel seized over 800 pieces of religious propaganda, audio tapes, and books from their residence. Some of the propaganda materials contained content attacking the Chinese government and interfering in China's internal affairs. A spokesperson for the Yunnan Provincial Public Security Bureau stated that Davis, Gwendolyn Nami, and the other 9 Americans violated Article 36 of the "Constitution of the People's Republic of China," which states that "religious groups and religious affairs shall not be subject to foreign domination," as well as relevant provisions of the "Regulations on Administrative Penalties for Public Security" and the "Law of the People's Republic of China on the Control of Entry and Exit of Aliens."

The spokesperson also pointed out that we welcome foreigners to travel in China and protect the legal rights of foreigners who abide by Chinese laws.
