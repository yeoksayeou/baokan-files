Beijing Daily reporters

During the hunger strike by some students in Beijing, the "High Autonomy Alliance" claimed they would not contact the Beijing municipal government. To ensure the safety of the hunger-striking students, the Beijing Red Cross Society organized medical personnel to engage in rescue work, doing everything possible to guarantee the lives and health of the hunger-striking students, ensuring that no student died and no serious complications occurred. At the same time, relevant personnel from the Beijing Red Cross Society also contacted the leaders of the "High Autonomy Alliance" to work on quickly resolving the situation. However, the leaders of the "High Autonomy Alliance" had ulterior motives, disregarding the health of the hunger-striking students, deliberately delaying their rescue to escalate the situation, and deceiving public opinion and the masses. From the accounts of several incidents by members of the Beijing Red Cross Society, one can see some of the truths behind the "High Autonomy Alliance" organizing this hunger strike.

To gain intervention from international organizations, the "High Autonomy Alliance" even drove out the Red Cross rescue personnel from Tiananmen Square

On the afternoon of May 13, some students in the capital began a hunger strike. The municipal government paid close attention to this, and by 9 PM that night, dispatched medical personnel from the Beijing Red Cross Society and two ambulances from the Beijing Emergency Center to the vicinity of the square to prepare salt, sugar, and boiling water for the hunger-striking students. Medical personnel went to the square to deliver water and medicine, conduct rounds, treatment, and transport patients for rescue work.

By May 16, 600 people had fainted on the square. The 2,200 medical personnel and students from 22 hospitals and medical colleges on the scene appealed to the Beijing Red Cross Society to take immediate measures to ensure the safety of the hunger-striking students. At the same time, 1,200 hunger-striking students jointly signed a letter expressing their highest respect for the medical personnel from the Beijing Red Cross Society and various hospitals who had helped them. In the afternoon at 5 PM, students on the square also held up banners demanding a dialogue with the responsible person from the Beijing Red Cross Society. At 7 PM, the executive committee members of the "High Autonomy Alliance," including Xiong Wei, met with the responsible person from the Beijing Red Cross Society.

Xiong Wei and others did not specifically propose how to rescue the hunger-striking students but instead presented a letter of appeal to the International Red Cross, the Chinese Red Cross, and the Beijing Red Cross, stating that according to international customs, after 72 hours of hunger striking, the International Red Cross could intervene. They clearly stated that they wanted to contact the International Red Cross. This request was immediately rejected. In fact, there is no such custom internationally. The responsible person from the Beijing Red Cross Society said, "You claim to be patriotic, but why ask foreigners to do what Chinese people can do? The Beijing Red Cross Society has 620,000 members and is fully capable of taking on the responsibility of monitoring and medical treatment for the hunger-striking students." After repeated efforts by the Beijing Red Cross Society, the "High Autonomy Alliance" finally reached an agreement with the Beijing Red Cross Society to take over the monitoring, rescue, and treatment of the hunger-striking students starting from 1 AM on May 17.

At this time, Xiong Wei and others proposed to meet with the responsible person from the Chinese Red Cross Society. At the society, Xiong Wei and others repeatedly raised the issue of international organizations intervening. This time, they changed their tune, saying that UNESCO had such regulations, and the International Red Cross should inspect and intervene in hunger strikes lasting more than three days. The responsible person from the society told them that there is only one United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization in the world, but it has no regulations that allow it to intervene in hunger strikes in any country. The responsible person from the society rejected the "High Autonomy Alliance's" request.

Returning to Tiananmen Square from the Chinese Red Cross Society was already 0:40 AM on May 17. The leaders of the "High Autonomy Alliance" provocatively asked the responsible person from the Beijing Red Cross Society: Can you mobilize the rescue team in 20 minutes?

At 1 AM sharp, 80 members of the Beijing Red Cross Society, 16 ambulances, and two large buses arrived at the square on time.

The leaders of the "High Autonomy Alliance" were stunned and then disappeared.

According to the agreement, the "High Autonomy Alliance" was supposed to open the passage for the rescue personnel to enter the hunger strike circle and divide the hunger-striking students into four groups to facilitate the rescue personnel's diagnosis and rescue. However, the "High Autonomy Alliance" did not make any preparations, causing the rescue personnel to wait for over half an hour outside the square before they could enter the hunger strike circle. They saw that most of the hunger-striking students were already asleep, lying densely packed together, making it impossible for the rescue personnel to work or even distinguish who was asleep, who was unconscious, and who was weak.

With the assistance of medical students, the rescue personnel woke up and examined each student, and hundreds of students who had been on a hunger strike for more than three days were promptly sent to various hospitals.

Around 4 AM, the broadcast on the square suddenly sounded: The "High Autonomy Alliance" unilaterally tore up the agreement, announcing that the Beijing Red Cross Society was not welcome and drove out the medical personnel who had come to rescue them.

The "High Autonomy Alliance" used the lives of the majority of hunger-striking students as political bargaining chips, proposing harsh conditions to escalate the situation

The "High Autonomy Alliance's" action of driving out the Red Cross medical personnel was opposed by the majority of hunger-striking students. By the afternoon of May 17, the number of hunger-striking students sent to the hospital for rescue had reached 1,700. They all received treatment, and some students began to eat under the persuasion of the medical personnel. These students reflected that the "High Autonomy Alliance" had set up checkpoints, making it difficult for hunger-striking students to contact the outside world, and they heard various slogans from the supporters, feeling that the nature of the event had changed. They expressed support and gratitude to the Beijing Red Cross Society for their monitoring and rescue. Some students on the square also questioned the "High Autonomy Alliance": After driving away the Beijing Red Cross Society, how would they guarantee the safety of the hunger-striking students? It was only then that the "High Autonomy Alliance" apologized to the Beijing Red Cross Society and invited back the medical rescue personnel.

At 5 PM on May 17, the Beijing Red Cross Society received a notice from the municipal government that there would be thunderstorms on May 18, requesting the Beijing Red Cross Society and relevant departments to help solve the problem of sheltering the hunger-striking students from the rain. The Beijing Red Cross Society immediately contacted the "High Autonomy Alliance" and the hunger strike command center, proposing a plan to use large buses for shelter, but it was not until midnight that the executive committee member Guo Haifeng of the "High Autonomy Alliance" responded.

Guo Haifeng insisted on demanding that the Beijing Red Cross Society provide them with tents. Previously, the "High Autonomy Alliance" had made such a request to stay on the square for a long time. The responsible person from the Beijing Red Cross Society said that, from the perspective of ensuring the health of the hunger-striking students, large buses should be used, which is beneficial for cleaning and disinfection, while tents are prone to water ingress and bacterial growth. Guo Haifeng asked, "Are you using large buses to take all the students away?" The responsible person from the Beijing Red Cross Society told him, "We will not take anyone away. But you should consider the safety of the students. If you let the students get caught in a heavy rain or lie on the wet ground in a tent and get seriously ill, can you take responsibility?" Guo Haifeng then said he would go back to discuss it.

It was not until 2:30 AM on May 18 that the "High Autonomy Alliance" agreed to use large buses to shelter the hunger-striking students from the rain. They proposed that 70 large buses should enter the square by 6 AM on May 18.

At 5:50 AM, the Beijing Public Transportation Corporation overcame various difficulties, and 70 large buses drove into the square.

The hunger-striking students cheered as they entered the large buses. However, the "High Autonomy Alliance" once again tore up the agreement. The agreement stated that the hunger-striking students should protect the large buses. However, most of the large buses that entered the square either had their tires punctured, had their air let out, or even had their engines damaged.

There were indeed people behind the scenes directing the "High Autonomy Alliance's" hunger strike activities

At 5 AM on May 18, Party and state leaders Li Peng and others visited the hospital to see the hunger-striking students, hoping that the students would end their hunger strike as soon as possible and receive treatment in the hospital. At this time, the number of hunger-striking students sent to the hospital had reached 3,504, and 32 had serious conditions. There was a possibility of a large-scale epidemic breaking out on Tiananmen Square at any time. For this reason, the Beijing Red Cross Society issued an urgent appeal through the media, urgently calling on students to cherish their bodies, stop the hunger strike, and the Red Cross Society was willing to rescue, monitor, and treat the hunger-striking students.

From the early morning of May 18, the responsible person from the Beijing Red Cross Society repeatedly sought out the leaders of the "High Autonomy Alliance" and the hunger strike team on the square for negotiations, and it was not until the afternoon that Guo Haifeng and others from the "High Autonomy Alliance" agreed to a dialogue. They let the responsible person from the Beijing Red Cross Society follow them onto the hunger strike command vehicle, and they wandered around the square and the front gate area for 4 hours, eating, drinking, and reading the "Hunger Strike Declaration" over the loudspeaker, completely disregarding the issue of rescuing the hunger-striking students. Finally, the leader of the "High Autonomy Alliance," Feng Chengde, told the responsible person from the Red Cross Society to come back at 12 AM to the Monument to find them.

This negotiation lasted from 12 AM on May 18 to the afternoon of May 19. During this period, a student from Peking University broke through several checkpoints and rushed onto the command vehicle where the negotiations were taking place, loudly reproaching the leaders of the "High Autonomy Alliance" for treating the lives of the hunger-striking students as a joke. The responsible person from the Beijing Red Cross Society finally sternly stated, "If you continue to obstruct our monitoring of the hunger-striking students and insist on the hunger strike, if a student dies, you will not be able to explain to society, to the students' parents, and to the broad student body!" He firmly said, "You hand over the hunger-striking students to us, and the Red Cross Society will guarantee their safety. If you do not hand them over, you will be responsible for all the consequences!" The 9 leaders of the "High Autonomy Alliance" present were evasive. At 8 PM, 7 out of the 9 people expressed agreement to stop the hunger strike and let the Beijing Red Cross Society monitor the hunger-striking students, and they were ready to sign the agreement.

At this moment, a person of unknown identity rushed into the negotiation scene and handed over a note. The leaders of the "High Autonomy Alliance" looked at it and immediately stood up, saying only, "We will not sign the agreement. You can come back in an hour to hear our response," and then hurriedly left.

An hour later, it was 9 PM, just one hour before the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council held a meeting of Party and government cadres in the capital, the "High Autonomy Alliance" announced over the loudspeaker on Tiananmen Square: To deepen the struggle, we will change the hunger strike to a sit-in. They also stated that there might be a special situation tonight. At the same time, teams of university students organized by the "High Autonomy Alliance" rushed to various intersections outside the city, preparing to block military vehicles.

The above facts show that the Beijing Red Cross Society, entrusted by the municipal government, genuinely and sincerely rescued the large number of students during the hunger strike, and their actions reflected the concern and care of the Party and government for the students. The former front organization of the hunger strike, the "High Autonomy Alliance," used and deceived the hunger-striking students, disregarding their lives and deaths, using despicable means to put pressure on the government, and engaged in political blackmail.

　　看“高自联”如何利用绝食学生搞政治讹诈    
    ——部分医务人员谈绝食现场救护见闻
    北京日报记者
    首都部分大学生在天安门广场绝食请愿期间，“高自联”宣称不与北京市政府发生联系。为了确保绝食学生安全，市红十字会组织医务人员投入救护工作，千方百计保证绝食学生的生命和健康，使得绝食学生没有一人死亡，也没有出现一例严重的合并症。同时，市红十字会有关人员还与“高自联”头头进行接触，做尽快平息事态的各项工作。但是，“高自联”头头却别有用心，置绝食学生的身体健康于不顾，故意拖延对绝食学生的救护，以扩大事态，欺骗舆论和群众。从市红十字会的一些会员讲述的这几件事情，可以看出“高自联”组织这场绝食的一些真相。
    “高自联”为取得国际组织干预，竟将红十字会的救护人员赶出天安门广场
    ５月１３日下午５时，首都部分大学生开始绝食请愿。市政府对此十分关注，当晚９点即派市红十字会的医务人员和市急救中心的两辆救护车进入广场附近，为绝食学生准备了食盐、白糖和开水，医务人员到广场给学生送水送药，进行巡诊、治疗和接送病号等救护工作。
    ５月１６日，广场上已有６００人次晕倒，在现场进行救护工作的２２所医院和医学院校师生呼吁，要求市红十字会迅速采取措施，以保证绝食学生的生命安全。与此同时，１２００名绝食学生联合签名，对市红十字会及各医院帮助他们的医务人员表示最高的敬意。下午５时，广场上的学生还打出横幅，要求与市红十字会负责人对话。晚７时，“高自联”常委熊炜等人与市红十字会负责人会面了。
    熊炜等人并未具体提出如何对绝食学生进行救护，而是拿出一份写给国际红十字会、中国红十字会、北京红十字会的呼吁书，声称按照国际惯例，绝食７２小时以上，国际红十字会可以干预。并明确表示要与国际红十字会进行联系。这一要求被当场拒绝了。实际上，国际上根本没有这种惯例。市红十字会的负责人说：“你们不是爱国吗？中国人能干的事为什么要请洋人来干呢？我们北京红十字会有６２万会员，完全有能力担负起对绝食学生的监护和医疗工作。”经过市红十字会的反复做工作，“高自联”才与市红十字会达成协议，从１７日凌晨１时起，由市红十字会全部接管对绝食学生的监护、抢救、治疗工作。
    这时，熊炜等人又提出要与中国红十字总会负责人见面。在总会，熊炜等人又一再提出要国际组织干预的问题。这次他们改口说，国际科教文组织有这种规定，国际红十字会应对绝食３天以上者进行检查干预。总会的负责同志告诉他们，世界上只有一个联合国教科文组织，但它并没有规定可以干预哪个国家的绝食活动。总会的负责同志拒绝了“高自联”的这项要求。
    从中国红十字总会回到天安门广场已是１７日凌晨零点四十分，“高自联”的头头们挑衅地问北京市红十字会的负责人：２０分钟后，你们能调救护队伍来吗？
    凌晨１时整，市红十字会的８０名会员、１６辆救护车和两辆大轿车准时到达了广场。
    “高自联”的头头们愣了，继而都不露面了。
    按照协议，“高自联”应负责打开救护人员进入绝食圈的通道，并将绝食学生分成四组，以利救护人员进行诊断和救护。可是“高自联”根本没有进行一点准备，致使救护人员在广场外等了半个多小时才得以进入广场绝食圈。只见绝食的学生绝大多数已经入睡，密密麻麻躺成一片，救护人员既无法下脚工作，也很难看出谁是睡熟、谁是昏迷、谁的身体虚弱。
    救护人员在医学院校师生的协助下，一个个将学生推醒诊断，数百名绝食三天以上的体弱同学被及时地送往各医院。
    凌晨４时许，广场上的广播突然响了：“高自联”单方面撕毁了协议，宣布市红十字会不受欢迎，将前来救护的医务人员赶出了广场。
    “高自联”以广大绝食学生的生命为政治筹码，提出苛刻条件企图扩大事态
    “高自联”轰赶红十字会医务人员的举动遭到了广大绝食学生的反对。至１７日下午，被送往医院抢救的绝食学生已达１７００人次。他们都接受了治疗，在医务人员的劝说下，一些学生开始进食。这些学生反映，“高自联”设立了纠察线，绝食学生难以与外界接触，听到声援的人喊什么口号的都有，已感到性质发生变化了。他们对市红十字会对他们的监护抢救表示支持和感谢。广场上的一些学生还质问“高自联”：轰走市红十字会后，怎样保证绝食学生的生命安全？此时，“高自联”才向市红十字会表示道歉，又请回了医疗救护人员。
    １７日下午５时，市红十字会接到市政府的通知，１８日将有雷阵雨，要求市红十字会和有关部门帮助解决绝食学生的避雨问题。市红十字会马上与“高自联”和学生绝食指挥部联系，提出用大轿车避雨的方案，但直到深夜１２点多，“高自联”的常委郭海峰才出面答复。
    郭海峰坚持要求市红十字会给他们提供帐篷，在此之前，“高自联”已提出过这样的要求，以便在广场长期呆下去。市红十字会负责人说，从保证绝食学生健康出发，应该使用大轿车，这样有利清扫和消毒，而帐篷则容易进水和滋生病菌。郭海峰却问：“你们用大轿车，是不是想把学生都拉走？”市红十字会负责人告诉他：“我们一个也不会拉走。但是你们要考虑学生的生命安全。如果让学生淋大雨、或躺在帐篷里的湿地上生了大病，你们负得起责任吗？”郭海峰这才表示要回去商量商量。
    一直拖延到１８日凌晨两点多，“高自联”才同意用大轿车让绝食学生避雨。他们提出，７０辆大轿车要在１８日早６∶００开进广场。
    ５∶５０，市公交总公司克服了种种困难，７０辆大轿车驶进广场。
    绝食的学生们欢呼着进了大轿车。然而，“高自联”又一次撕毁了协议。协议规定，绝食学生应保护大轿车。但是，开进广场的“大轿车”大都不是被扎了车带，就是被放了气，甚至被损坏了发动机。
    幕后确有操纵者指挥着“高自联”组织的绝食活动
    １８日清晨５时，党和国家领导人李鹏等到医院去看望了绝食的学生，希望同学们尽快结束绝食，尽快到医院接受治疗。这时，被送进医院的绝食学生已达３５０４人次，并有３２人病情严重，天安门广场随时有爆发大规模流行病的可能。为此，市红十字会通过新闻媒介发出紧急呼吁，迫切呼吁学生们爱惜身体，停止绝食，红十字会愿意对绝食学生进行抢救、监护和治疗。
    从１８日凌晨起，市红十字会的负责人一次次地找“高自联”和广场绝食团的头头们要求谈判，直到下午，“高自联”的郭海峰、柴玲等人才同意进行对话。他们让市红十字会的负责人跟着他们上了绝食指挥车，断断续续地在广场和前门一带转悠了４个小时，郭海峰、柴玲等人又吃又喝又对着喇叭念“绝食宣言”，根本不屑于谈绝食学生的救护问题。最后，“高自联”的头头封从德让红十字会的负责人晚上１２点再去纪念碑前找他们。
    这次谈判从１８日晚１２时左右一直进行到１９日下午。这期间，北京大学的一名学生越过几道纠察线，冲到正在谈判的指挥车上，大声斥责“高自联”的头头们把绝食的学生的生命当儿戏。市红十字会的负责人最后严厉表示：“如果你们继续阻止我们对绝食学生进行监护，仍然坚持绝食，一旦有学生发生死亡，你们将无法向社会、向学生家长、向广大学生交待！”他坚定地说：“你们把绝食学生交给我们，我们红十字会保证负责他们的生命安全。如果不交，一切后果将由你们负责！”
    在场的９名“高自联”头头含糊了。晚８点，９人当中有７人表示同意停止绝食，由市红十字会监护绝食的学生，并准备在协议书上签字。
    这时，一个不明身份的人匆匆闯入谈判现场，送来一张纸条。“高自联”的头头们看后立即起身，只说了一句“协议我们不签了，你们过一个小时再听答复吧”，便都匆匆离去了。
    一个小时后是晚９点，也就是在党中央国务院召开首都党政军干部大会之前一小时，“高自联”在天安门广场的高音喇叭上宣布：为了使斗争深入下去，我们将绝食改为静坐。并声称今晚可能发生特殊情况。与此同时，“高自联”组织的一队队大学生赶到了城外各个路口，准备堵截军车了。
    以上事实说明，受市政府委托支持的市红十字会在学生绝食期间真心诚意地救护广大学生，他们的行动体现了党和政府对大学生的关心和爱护。已绝食的前台组织者“高自联”则利用和欺骗绝食学生，将他们生死存亡置之度外，以卑鄙的手段向政府施加压力，搞了一场政治讹诈。
