Xinhua News Agency, June 17th. According to information from the Communist Party of China Central Committee's State Organs Work Committee, on June 13th, the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council held a meeting with leaders from various departments. After the meeting, the various departments of the central state organs quickly conveyed Comrade Xiaoping's important speech during his reception of senior military officers of the capital's martial law troops, as well as the important speeches by leaders such as Li Peng and Yao Yilin, to leaders at all levels and all party members. They also conducted serious discussions. Sixty-one departments made learning arrangements based on their specific circumstances, and some even held special party group meetings, departmental meetings, and meetings with leaders at the bureau level to conduct in-depth learning and discussions related to their work and thoughts.

The Communist Party of China Central Committee's State Organs Work Committee held an expanded meeting of the entire committee to study and discuss the aforementioned important speeches. The meeting proposed to conduct in-depth and detailed ideological and political work based on the actual thoughts of the cadres and staff.

The Foreign Affairs Department's Party Committee discussed and studied how to actively carry out foreign work under the current situation. Everyone agreed that some people internationally are attempting to use this turmoil to pressure China, interfere in internal affairs, and this must be resolutely opposed. It was also pointed out that China's independent and peaceful foreign policy remains unchanged, the policy of reform and opening up remains unchanged, and the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee remain unchanged.

The State Planning Commission stated that it will continue to push forward the implementation of this year's annual plan, further coordinate and dispatch production and transportation work, carry out various tasks to clean up fixed asset investment projects and reduce the scale of investment, and further strengthen the study of macroeconomic control.

The Supervision Department requires all cadres in the department to be resolute in two aspects: first, the attitude towards suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion must be resolute. Second, the anti-corruption struggle must be resolute and cannot be relaxed because some people use the anti-corruption slogan to achieve ulterior motives during the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

The Personnel Department proposed to make personnel work better serve reform and opening up, and serve the construction of a clean government.

The leaders and the majority of party members of the Metallurgical Department expressed their determination to rely on the transformation, expansion, and development of existing enterprises to increase steel production, overcome all difficulties, and make up for the losses caused by this counter-revolutionary rebellion.

The Party Group of the Ministry of Railways expressed that it will organize all party members and staff on the railway to overcome all difficulties and ensure the smooth operation of railway transportation.

The meeting of the office of the Minister of Aeronautics and Astronautics expressed its firm response to the call of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, to suppress the rebellion with one hand and to grasp scientific research and production with the other.

The Public Security Department proposed to strengthen public security work during the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, establish legal authority, maintain the authority of the public security organs, and build the public security organs well.

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 17th. In recent days, the Party Committees of Guangdong, Liaoning, Jilin, Xinjiang, Zhejiang, and Heilongjiang provinces and autonomous regions have held expanded meetings of the Standing Committee and meetings with responsible comrades from provincial-level organs to seriously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech on June 9th when he met with senior military officers of the capital's martial law troops. They unanimously expressed their full support and resolute implementation.

They believe that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech deeply analyzes the root causes, nature, and correctness of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission's decisions regarding the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital. It is a weapon of thought to thoroughly suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital and stabilize the national situation, and it has extremely important significance for uniting the thoughts of the entire Party and the people of the country. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech also deeply expounds on the correctness of the Party's line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, reaffirms the grand goal and development strategy of modernization construction, and reaffirms the "one center, two basic points" summarized by the Thirteenth Party Congress. This has a very important guiding role for China's current and future reform and construction.

They expressed in the study and discussion that they would fully and deeply understand the essence of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech and use the spirit of the speech to guide their work. Everyone believes that at present, they should use the spirit of Comrade Xiaoping's speech to unify thoughts, understand the essence of this struggle, and correctly recognize the series of decisions made by the Party Central Committee in this struggle. They must continue to stabilize the situation and make practical contributions to the thorough suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital with their actions.

They pointed out that the study and implementation of Comrade Xiaoping's important speech should continue to firmly implement the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, eliminate various doubts, and more firmly implement the "one center, two basic points." They should use the Four Cardinal Principles to educate the people, students, all cadres, and Communist Party members, consciously resist bourgeois liberalization, oppose spiritual pollution, and firmly follow the Party Central Committee in walking the socialist road. At the same time, they should more concretely grasp the reform and opening up and the construction of modernization.
