　　欧洲男篮锦标赛降下帷幕    
    南斯拉夫队第四次荣获桂冠
    新华社北京６月２６日电  据外电报道，南斯拉夫队２５日在本土萨格勒布进行的欧洲男篮锦标赛决赛中，以９８∶７７战胜上届冠军希腊队，第四次获得这项比赛的冠军。
    南斯拉夫队在决赛中比分一直领先，上半时以５４∶３４赢对方２０分。下半时头１５分钟，南队仍未给对方以喘息之机，竟以３５分的优势遥遥领先。之后，胜券在握的奥运会亚军松了口气，希腊队乘机捞回不少分。
    在这场比赛中，南队球星佩特罗维奇得了２８分，为全场个人得分最多的选手。希腊球星加利斯被对方守得难以施威，开赛１５分钟时仅得了４分。
    南斯拉夫队曾于１９７７年击败苏联队第三次夺得欧洲冠军。南队和希腊队是分别战胜意大利队和苏联队后进入决赛的。
    在另一场决赛中，奥运会冠军苏联队以１０４∶７４击败意大利队，获得铜牌。意大利队名列第四。西班牙、法国、保加利亚和荷兰队分列第五至第八名。获前５名的队取得参加下届世界男篮锦标赛的比赛资格。
