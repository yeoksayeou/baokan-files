The once quiet Shanghai literary scene has become lively again, with writers moving from a state of mutual tolerance to "internal strife" as the trend of criticism and counter-criticism gains momentum.

The increasingly active *Shanghai Wenlun* has consecutively published articles such as "Muses in the City," "Strolling in the Grass," and "Chen Chun: For Don Quixote of Dusinia" evaluating Shanghai writers and critics, all penned by young writers from the Shanghai literary circle. The *Shanghai Literature*, which has long focused on publishing pure literary works, has also recently launched the "Critics' Club" column, providing a platform for writers to engage in verbal sparring. Those who have been criticized are not willing to remain silent and have also published responses in *Literary Corner* and *Book Forest*.

This development reminds one of the vibrant Shanghai literary scene of the 1920s and 1930s. At that time, literary debates were intense, with giants like Lu Xun, Mao Dun, and Feng Xuefeng actively cultivating the art of criticism. Masterpieces emerged, leaving a profound impact on the Chinese literary world.

The function of literary criticism is also evolving. Political debates are increasingly being replaced by discussions on artistic merit, depth, success, and failure. Whether it is criticism or counter-criticism, despite the sharp exchanges, the focus remains on objective analysis and evaluation. Critics are often referred to as "connoisseurs," who specialize in tasting others' works and then nitpicking, often without being criticized themselves. This phenomenon is also changing, as both the "cooks"—writers—and the "connoisseurs" are now subject to criticism. "Strolling in the Grass" scans a group of young critics in Shanghai who have gained national influence, with the author Wang Binbin pointing out the "weeds" they have planted in the theoretical field. It is understood that writers generally accept these criticisms.

### 批评反批评之风兴盛  上海文坛出现新气象

　　批评反批评之风兴盛
    上海文坛出现新气象
    新华社上海５月３１日电  （记者赵兰英、实习生朱丹）冷清数年的上海文坛热闹起来，文人们从相安无事走向“内哄”……兴起批评与反批评之风。
    日趋活跃的《上海文论》，连续刊出《都市里的缪斯》、《草丛中的漫步》、《陈村：为了杜辛尼亚的堂·吉诃德》等评论上海作家和评论家的文章，作者均是上海文坛上的青年人。长期坚持发表纯文学作品的《上海文学》也在近期内推出《批评家俱乐部》一栏，给文人们以施展唇枪舌剑之地。被批评者也不甘寂寞，纷纷在《文学角》、《书林》等载文进行反批评。
    这一态势，令人想起活跃的二三十年代上海文坛。其时，文坛论争极为热烈，鲁迅、茅盾、冯雪峰等文坛巨匠积极浇灌批评之花，名家名作脱颖而出，给中国文坛带来深远影响。
    文艺批评的功能也在变化，政治论争更多地为艺术的高低、粗细、成败等等论争所取代。批评也好，反批评也好，尽管针尖对麦芒，但多的仍是客观的分析与评价。评论家多被称为“食客”，专品味他人的作品，然后横挑鼻子竖挑眼，自己却常不被人指责。如今这一现象也在改变，受到批评的不仅是“厨师”——作家，“食客”也同时受到批评。《草丛中的漫步》对在全国有一定影响的上海青年评论家群进行“扫描”，作者王彬彬——指出他们在理论园地里栽下的“蒿草”。据了解，文人们大多接受批评。
