	Wake Up, Dream of Officialdom!
	Wei Xinde

	A young man still in college eagerly asks the relevant department: what kind of "official hat" will he get after graduation. Another young man, assigned a deputy position by the organization, bluntly states: he wants a full position! The allure that induces young people to dream of officialdom is naturally the reality of "promotion and wealth," "officials are noble, commoners are lowly." "Official stamps," "official salaries," "official cars," "official houses," "official meals," "official residences" ... all kinds of privileges and benefits centered around the "official hierarchy" undoubtedly have a magnetic attraction for young people.

	Yesterday, today, and tomorrow of society cannot do without "officials." However, to achieve the dream of officialdom by any means necessary is not commendable. In our country, "officials" should be servants of the people, and being an official is to serve the people. Equating being an official with seeking pleasure is shameful. Such people, even if they become officials, will not be good servants of the people, but will only be greedy thieves seeking personal gain, and will ultimately be abandoned by the people!

	The value of a person does not lie in whether they are an official or not, or in the size of their position. People with ideals and aspirations can achieve great things even if they are not officials. Throughout history, both in China and abroad, those with knowledge and learning often have greater value, influence, and impact than officials. In many economically developed countries, people are indifferent to becoming officials but respect knowledge, and have few prejudices about what kind of work they do. An American ambassador from the 1980s, after leaving his post, became a tour guide. If we can accept the idea that being an ambassador and being a tour guide are equally valuable, we can avoid many troubles!

	Of course, this matter is not so simple. To reduce the emphasis on becoming an official, the key is to change the current reality of "official hierarchy." Society still needs various kinds of talents, and all 360 trades are beneficial to society and human development. Therefore, young people should still focus on studying and pursuing their careers. If everyone rushes onto the same "official path," dreaming of unrealistic "official hats," it will not only be painful but also impractical!

	Wake up, dream of officialdom!

　　醒来吧，乌纱梦！
    魏信德
    一个尚在读大专的青年，迫不及待地询问有关部门：他毕业后给什么样的“乌纱帽”。另有一青年，组织上安排他副职，他竟直言不讳：要给给正职！诱发青年做“乌纱梦”的，自然是“升官发财”、“官贵民贱”的现实。“官贴”、“官薪”、“官车”、“官屋”、“官吃”、“官住”……以“官本位”为核心的种种特权和优惠，对青年无疑有磁石般的引力。
    社会的昨天、今天和明天，不能无“官”。然而，为实现“乌纱梦”，不择手段往上爬，则不足取。在我们国家，“官”应是民之仆，当官是要为民办事。把当官与寻欢作乐划等号，实为可耻。这样的人，即使当了官，也不会是一个为民做好事的“公仆”，而只会是一个谋个人私利的贪贼，终究会被人民所抛弃！
    人之价值，不在于做不做官，官大与官小。人有理想和抱负，不当官也可有作为。古今中外，凡有学问者，其价值、作用和影响，常常远在当官者之上。世界上不少经济发达国家，人们就淡于为官，而尊敬学问，对干什么工作极少偏见。一位八十年代的美国驻外大使卸任后，干起了导游。我们倘若能接受当大使和当导游都一样的观念，必可省去许许多多的麻烦！
    当然，此事并非那么简单。要淡化当官的观念，关键还是要改变目前这种“官本位”的现实。社会毕竟还是需要各式各样人才的，三百六十行都有利于社会和人类发展。因此，青年人还是应多做学问奔前程。大家都挤在一条“官道”上，尽做想入非非的“乌纱梦”，不仅痛苦，也不现实！
    醒来吧，“乌纱梦”！
