Being dismissed by a company, a term that has always been painful and an embarrassing situation, has entered people's lives in the 1980s.

"Please give me a way out!" A skilled worker who had been working at a cotton mill for over 20 years actually requested to be dismissed, sounding like a plea and also like an ultimatum. Before this, he had repeatedly requested to be dismissed but was unsuccessful.

"I request to resign," said a young worker, handing over a thick stack of RMB as training fees to the company.

"You can agree or disagree, but I have to leave."

In 1988, Beijing had 14,000 people who either voluntarily resigned or were "actively" dismissed by their companies. Among them, the majority were key production personnel and skilled workers in enterprises, as well as recent graduates from universities and graduate schools.

How do people view these "job hoppers"? What is their current situation?

"Mid-career job hopping by employees causes a gap in the production and management personnel of enterprises." The leadership of Beijing Cotton Mill No. 2, which is severely affected by personnel loss, expressed astonishment at this somewhat unequal "talent competition" but found no solution. Originally, this state-owned enterprise with over 9,000 employees had seen over 1,000 people leave in recent years. In terms of age structure, those around 30 years old were the most numerous. There were loom operators, electricians, and truck drivers.

Enterprise personnel believe that the reasons for "job hopping" are multifaceted. Some are dissatisfied with the current state of their company; the sudden wealth of individual entrepreneurs and the relatively high income of joint ventures are also strong attractions. Some applicants for resignation have already found a way out and have a transfer order from the receiving unit in their pockets. Such people are determined to leave and cannot be stopped. A computer room assistant engineer in a certain cotton mill in Beijing "job hopped" to a company and was immediately promoted to engineer, with a corresponding increase in basic salary. The factory leadership's attempts to retain him were unsuccessful, and the "freeze" transfer measure was ineffective. The receiving unit proposed not to take the salary relationship and personnel file, and this technical staff member left without saying goodbye.

Not all "job hoppers" can immediately find a suitable position. Some temporarily store their personnel files with the street office, despite paying an annual storage fee of 180 yuan, which they do not mind. They place their hopes on the labor market in the capital, where there is no interference from "personal connections" and "relationships," providing every job seeker with an open and equal opportunity. Some people with business expertise are very popular in the market. At last year's labor market in Xicheng District, a young man named Zhou Jie, who could drive, work as an electrician, and operate a boiler, was sought after by four units on the spot. That morning, another 50-plus technicians with expertise in electricity and welding also found relatively ideal jobs.

However, those "job hoppers" without business expertise have become "difficult cases." After hitting a wall everywhere, some of them want to return to their original units.

"Factory director, please show mercy and let me come back to work." During a reporter's visit to a factory, a young woman worker was seen crying. It turned out that this woman worker saw that some people who had "job hopped" from the factory had found easier jobs, and some had increased their income. She was tempted and submitted a resignation application to the factory in August last year. The factory leadership, considering her actual situation, did not agree to her request. However, this woman worker adopted the tactic of absenteeism and did not show up for three months. She achieved her goal of being dismissed. But things did not go as she wished. After staying at home for more than half a year, she still did not find a suitable place. Family members complained, and neighbors gossiped. She could not stay at home and today, she visited the factory leadership for the fifth time.

Those who "job hopped" into the circulation sector have a different situation. In a corner of the capital's street market, a "boss" dressed in a dark gray suit and a red tie said, "I really regret leaving the factory too late..." A young man next to him, wearing jeans, bare-chested, with curly hair, took over, "Brother, selling goods on the street, cold in winter, hot in summer, wind, rain, sun, and many troubles, you should experience these flavors." Then, he used his mouth to point to an empty stall next to him and said, "That guy secretly returned to a state-owned store a few days ago and picked up the iron rice bowl again." This is truly, throwing away the "iron rice bowl" and then wanting the "iron rice bowl" again!

"Job hoppers" are not all for money. Jiang Guanjun, the publicity officer of Dongan Market, is one of them. She served in the military for over ten years and, after being demobilized, worked in the Beijing Daily Chemical Factory as the secretary of the Youth League Committee and deputy director of the office, and later became the party branch secretary of a workshop. For her, the career path in the factory was bright, and there were two opportunities each year to increase her salary. The problem is that her home is too far from her workplace, and she spends at least 4 hours commuting every day. In February this year, she came to Dongan Market to work as a clerk, and her economic income decreased significantly. She was willing. What for? "Saving time on commuting every day is equivalent to extending life," she replied frankly.

Wang Qiuya is straightforward. Before coming to Dongan Market, she was a teacher at Beijing Business College, and her husband had already been allocated a house in the college. She had been teaching for four years. In the spring of last year, Wang Qiuya and some students came to Dongan Market for internships, and she was deeply attracted by the Dongan Group Company, which was famous. She said: I study business economics, but as soon as I contact the actual situation, I feel that the knowledge I have learned is pale. So I came to Dongan Market.

A university teacher comes to the market to work as a clerk, even giving up the house allocated by the original unit, is it a bit of a loss? She answered cheerfully: "I seek personal satisfaction in my career."

How should we view the "job hopping" phenomenon? Economic circles believe that this is a challenge to the labor distribution system that has existed for many years, indicating that they begin to pay attention to their own value and competitive consciousness.

Facing this situation, if "command-style" and "closed-style" measures are used, it is no longer possible to solve the talent flow problem that will inevitably emerge in the development of commodity economy.

The strategy can only be found in deepening the reform.

### 从“跳槽”看就业动向

　　从“跳槽”看就业动向
    本报记者  赵兴林
    被单位除名，这个一向刺人的字眼和令人难堪的境况，８０年代已闯进人们的生活。
    “给我一条生路吧！”一位在棉纺厂工作２０多年的熟练工竟然要求除名，像是哀求又似乎是最后“通牒”。之前他已多次请求单位除名而未成。
    “我要求辞职”，一位青年工人递来厚厚的一沓人民币，作为向单位交纳的培训费。
    “你同意也好，不同意也好，反正我得走人。”
    １９８８年，北京市自动辞职，或采取“主动”被单位除名的有１４０００多人。他们中多数是企业的生产骨干、熟练工，也有走上工作岗位不久的大学生、研究生。
    人们怎样看待这些“跳槽”者？他们现在的境况又如何呢？
    “就业职工中途‘跳槽’，使企业生产和管理人员出现了断层。”人员流失严重的北京棉纺二厂领导对这种不甚平等的“人才竞争”发出惊叹，却又找不到对策。原来这个拥有９０００多名职工的国营企业，近年来人员外流达１０００多人。从年龄结构看，３０岁左右的居多。有挡车工、电工、汽车司机。
    企业界人士认为，“跳槽”，个中原因是多方面的，不满本单位现状者有之；个体户的暴富，合资企业的较高收入，也是很强的吸引力。有些申请辞职者，事先已找好门路、衣袋里揣着已经联系好接收单位的调令。这种人横下心要走，拉也拉不住。北京某国棉厂计算机室有位助理工程师，“跳槽”到一家公司，马上被晋升为工程师，基本工资随之上涨。厂领导挽留不住，采取“冻结”调出措施无济于事。接收单位提出不要工资关系、人事档案，这位技术员不辞而去。
    不是所有“跳槽”者都能马上找到合适单位，有的把自己的档案材料，暂时寄存街道办事处，尽管每年交纳１８０元保管费，也在所不惜。他们把希望寄托在首都的劳务市场，那儿没有“人情”、“关系”干扰，给每个求职者以公开、平等的机遇。一些有业务专长的人在市场上非常吃香，在去年西城区举办的劳务市场上，一个小伙子名叫周杰，会驾驶、电工和司炉，在场的４个单位争着要。这天上午，另外有５０多位有技术专长的电工、焊工，也都找到了比较理想的职业。
    而那些无业务专长的“跳槽”者，却成了“困难户”，他们四处碰壁之后，想回原单位的也不乏其人。
    “厂长，开开恩，让我回来上班吧。”记者在一家工厂采访时，就遇上一位哭哭啼啼的青年女工。原来这位女工看到从本厂“跳槽”出走的人，有的找到了轻松活计，有的增加了经济收入。她动心了，去年８月，向厂部递交了辞职申请书。厂领导考虑到她的实际情况，没有答应她的请求。但这位女工却采取旷工手段，一连３个月未露面。她被除名的目的达到了。可事与愿违，在家待了半年多，仍未找到合适去处。家人埋怨，邻里风言风语，在家待不下去了。今天，她第５次找厂领导。
    “跳槽”进入流通领域的，则是另一番景象。在首都摊群市场一隅，一位身穿深灰色西服，脖子上系红色领带的“老板”说：“我真后悔离开工厂太晚了……”旁边一位身着牛仔裤，上身赤膊、满头卷发的青年接过话茬：“老弟，在街头摆摊售货，冬冷夏热、风吹、雨淋、日晒，还有许多麻烦事，看来你该多尝尝这些滋味罗。”接着，他用嘴噜了噜旁边一个空摊位说：“那哥儿前几天悄悄回到一家国营商店，重端铁饭碗了。”这真是，扔掉“铁饭碗”，又想“铁饭碗”呀！
    “跳槽”者，并非都是为了钱。东安市场宣传干事姜冠军就是其中的一位。她从军十多年，从部队复员回京后，先后在市日化一厂任团委书记、厂办公室副主任，之后又到车间担任党支部书记。对她来说，在工厂仕途光明，并且每年还有两次向上浮动工资的机遇。问题是家离上班地太远，每天上下班路上至少４小时。今年２月，她来到东安市场当科员，经济收入减少了一大截。她心甘情愿。图什么？“每天上下班路途省时间，就等于延长了生命”，她坦然地回答。
    王秋霞，快人快语。她来东安市场前是北京商业学院教师，夫妇已在商学院分到了住房，执教也有４个年头了。去年春季，王秋霞和部分学生来东安市场实习，她深深被名声日震的东安集团公司吸引。她说：我是学商业经济的，但一接触实际，就感到自己所学得的知识苍白。所以才来东安市场的。
    大学教师来商场当办事员，连原单位分到的住房也退掉了，是不是有点吃亏？她爽朗地答：“我要求的是个人事业上的满足。”
    究竟如何看待“跳槽”现象？经济界有关人士认为：这是对多年来的劳动分配制度的冲击，表明他们开始注重自身价值和竞争意识。
    面对这种形势，如果采用“命令式”、“封闭式”手段，已无法解决商品经济发展中必然涌现出来的人才流动问题。
    对策，只能从深化改革中寻找。
