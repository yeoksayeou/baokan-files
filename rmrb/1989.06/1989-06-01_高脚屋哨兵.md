The blazing sun, the blue sea, and the silver towers; national dignity, military spirit, rainbows, and the southernmost family of the nation. Guarding the Nansha Islands, the sentinels of the reefs enjoy the distant horizon.

On some reefs in the Nansha Islands of our motherland, there stand silver-gray tower-like structures suspended above the waves, which people vividly call "stilt houses." Like the Cat Ear Cave in Laoshan, they forge batches of iron soldiers and also record the hardships and joys, virtues, and beliefs of these hot-blooded men.

New Year's Eve

Huayang Reef. Lunar New Year's Eve, 1988.

Due to the hurried arrival, no one brought a calendar, and the only watch with a calendar had "quit working." The soldiers had not known the exact date for several days. Just now, they were arguing heatedly about which day was the Spring Festival. Suddenly, a New Year's greeting from higher-ups was received, and everyone realized that today was New Year's Eve. They hurriedly went to the sea to celebrate.

The sea is generous. In no time, the soldiers returned to the stilt house with buckets of grouper, octopus, eel, clams, and crabs. Everyone busily prepared the New Year's meal. In an instant, the stilt house was filled with the enticing aroma of seafood.

Dishes were placed one by one on the table, and the comrades sat around, ready to eat the New Year's meal. "Report, there's a situation!" Before everyone could pick up their chopsticks, the sentinel rushed into the living quarters and shouted loudly. On the eastern side of the reef, three Vietnamese armed fishing boats were stealthily approaching the reef. After the boats got close to the reef, several dozen Vietnamese soldiers jumped off and began climbing onto the reef. "We can't let the Vietnamese soldiers land on the reef!" The reef commander Yan Junliang reported the situation to higher-ups while ordering the firing of signal flares to warn the Vietnamese soldiers. One after another, green signal flares soared into the sky, and the Vietnamese soldiers, who were crawling towards the reef, panicked and fled, climbing back onto their boats and escaping into the distance.

The soldiers, seeing the Vietnamese soldiers flee, returned to the living quarters. Who would have thought that just as the reef commander was about to start his New Year's greeting, the sentinel rushed in to say that the Vietnamese soldiers had returned. Without waiting for orders, the soldiers rushed out of the living quarters. At this time, it was near dusk, and the Vietnamese armed boats were ghostly in the twilight. The soldiers, hugging their rifles, lay in wait. At dawn, several dozen Vietnamese soldiers jumped off the boats and crept towards the stilt house. The soldiers, following the prearranged plan, immediately drove them back.

The sun came out, and the sea and sky were radiant. The soldiers, forgetting their fatigue, sat around again, using water as wine, raising their bowls to toast each other, celebrating the foiling of the Vietnamese soldiers' sneak attack and this unforgettable New Year's meal.

Longing

The harsh environment and extreme loneliness made these lively young men long even more for their homeland and their families.

Here, far from the mainland, there is no television, no newspapers. The only thing that can connect the soldiers to their homeland is the radio. But to save electricity, they can only listen to half an hour of news programs each day. At 6:30 every morning, the soldiers would gather around the radio. At this time, everyone not only wanted to understand the homeland but also wanted to savor something from the clear and pleasant voice of the announcer to comfort the deep longing for the homeland in their hearts.

They also longed for their families in a way that was like a wandering soul. Huayang Reef's political instructor Xie Changming especially missed his wife back home. A few months ago, when his nurse wife was giving a patient an injection, she was infected by the medicine and fell ill. The unit gave her half a year of leave, and she came to the unit with their three-year-old daughter. Who would have thought that the next day after arriving at the unit, Xie Changming received orders to go to Nansha to guard the reef. His wife did not utter a word of complaint, tears streaming down her face as she silently packed her husband's belongings. At the time of parting, his wife hugged their daughter and struggled to wave her right hand, which was still infected, and said tearfully, "Work hard, don't think of home, take care of yourself." At that time, Xie Changming, this iron man who had carried a waist injury and marched over 100 miles in one night without flinching during the self-defense counterattack against Vietnam, could not help but shed tears. Such a good wife, how could he not miss her?

New soldier Chen Xiangsong is the youngest in his family. Just a year ago, he was still by his mother's side, acting spoiled. This year, on the tenth day of the lunar New Year, it was his 19th birthday. In the past, on his birthday, his mother would always make him long noodles for longevity and boil eggs, peeling the shells for him to eat. After going to the reef, he missed his mother so much, hoping to have a happy birthday in Nansha. But to avoid bothering his comrades, on his birthday, he went on duty as usual. He stood on the lookout post with his rifle, gazing northward, and silently called out, "Mom, your son has grown up!"

Wish

If someone asked the sentinels of the stilt houses what their wishes were, they would answer without hesitation: "Take a bath, eat a plate of vegetables, that's enough." These most ordinary needs in life are rare luxuries for the soldiers of the stilt houses.

The climate in Nansha is hot and humid. During the day, the sun is scorching, and the reef is like a giant pot full of boiling water, with the stilt house like a steamer on top. At night, thick fog envelops everything, and the stilt house becomes a crystal palace, damp everywhere, with the bedding seeming to squeeze out water. Here, far from the mainland, fresh vegetables are scarce, seriously affecting people's appetites. To maintain their strength, the soldiers tried every means to increase their physical activity. The "Nansha Sentinel Dance" directed by Dongmen Reef's political instructor You Jianguo was the most popular among the soldiers. Everyone learned it on the first day and wanted to dance to their heart's content. Who would have thought that after just a few minutes, everyone was sweating profusely. You Jianguo had to announce loudly, "Freshwater is limited, the dance party is over." Thinking of the half basin of freshwater each person had per day, everyone's spirits sank.

So people looked forward to rain. But the sky seemed to intentionally test these new owners, not only was there little rain, but each time it came and went quickly. Often, before people finished washing, the rain would stop, and the sky would clear. The most embarrassing thing was that you had just lathered up with soap, but the rain stopped, leaving you in a state of laughter and tears.

Is it hard? Yes, it is hard. But there is sweetness and joy in the hardship. Every time the soldiers saw merchant ships flying the five-star red flag passing by the reef, and saw more and more fishing boats coming from the homeland, they would feel proud and content from the bottom of their hearts, as if all their wishes had been fulfilled.

　　高脚屋哨兵
    新华社记者  曹国强  孙茂庆  新华社通讯员  白煜章
    赤日、碧海、银塔；国威、军魂、虹霞、国之最南人家。卫我南沙，守礁人乐天涯
    在祖国南沙群岛的一些礁盘上矗立着一座座高悬于波涛之上的银灰色塔状建筑，人们形象地称它们为“高脚屋”。它如同老山的猫耳洞，熔炼出一批批钢铁战士，也记录着热血男儿们的辛苦与欢乐，情操与信念。
    　　　　年饭
    华阳礁。１９８８年农历除夕。
    由于来的匆忙，没带日历，唯一一块带日历的手表也“罢了工”，战士们已有好几天不知确切的日期了。刚才大家还为哪天是春节争得面红耳赤。正争着，收到了上级的春节慰问电，大家才知道今天就是除夕，忙高兴地赶海去了。
    大海是慷慨的。不大功夫，战士们就提着一桶桶石斑鱼、章鱼、海鳝、海蚌和螃蟹回到高脚屋。大伙七手八脚忙着作年饭。顷刻，高脚屋便飘出浓郁诱人的海鲜味。
    菜一个个摆上桌，战友们围坐在一起准备吃年饭。“报告，有情况！”不等大家动筷，哨兵跑进住舱高声呼喊。礁盘东侧，３艘越南武装渔船正鬼鬼祟祟地朝礁盘驶来。船靠近礁盘后，从上面跳下几十个越军便往礁盘上爬。“不能让越军上礁！”礁长颜俊良一边向上级报告情况，一边命令打信号弹向越军发出警告。一发发绿色信号弹腾空而起，在礁盘边蠢蠢蠕动的越军见状慌忙转身溃逃，爬上船向远方逃去。
    战士们见越军逃远了，便回到住舱。谁知，礁长的年饭祝辞刚开了个头，哨兵跑进来说越军又来了。战士们不等命令，又呼啦啦跑到住舱外。此时天近傍晚，暮色苍茫中越南武装船只在波涛间幽灵般晃动着。战士们在掩体内怀抱钢枪，枕戈待旦。黎明时分，几十名越军又从船上跳下，向高脚屋方向摸来。战士们按着预定方案，立即迎头驱赶。
    太阳出来了，海天间一片辉煌。战士们忘了疲劳，又一次围坐在一起，以水代酒，举碗相庆，为粉碎越军的偷袭，也为这难忘的年饭。
    　　　　思念
    艰苦的环境，极度的寂寞，使这些生龙活虎般的年轻人越发思念祖国，思念亲人。
    这里远离大陆，看不到电视，看不到报纸，唯一可连接战士和祖国感情的是广播。但为了省电每天只能听半小时新闻节目，一到早晨６点半，战士们都要围坐在收音机旁。此时，大家不仅要了解祖国，也想从播音员清脆、悦耳的话音中品味出些什么，以慰藉心底对祖国强烈的思念之情。
    他们也牵魂萦梦般思念着亲人。华阳礁指导员谢长明，格外思念远在家乡的妻子。几个月前，当护士的妻子给病人打针时被药物感染患病，单位给了她半年假，她带着３岁的女儿来到部队。谁知来队第二天，谢长明便接到赴南沙守礁的命令。妻子没有半句怨言，淌着泪，默默为丈夫收拾行装。离别时，妻子抱着女儿吃力地挥动着那只感染未愈的右手含泪道了一句：“好好干，别想家，多保重。”当时，谢长明这位在对越自卫还击战中，带着腰伤一夜穿插１００多里不皱眉的钢铁汉子，也禁不住掉了泪。这样的好妻子怎能不让他思念？
    新战士陈祥松在家是老么。一年前还在母亲身边撒娇呢。今年正月初十是他１９岁的生日，往年过生日，母亲总要为他作长寿面，煮鸡蛋亲手剥了皮看着他吃下去。上礁后，他想母亲想得好苦，多么希望在南沙过个快乐的生日。但为了不给战友添麻烦，生日这天他照常上了岗。他持枪站在哨位上，遥望北方心里默默呼唤着：“妈妈，您的儿子长大了！”
    　　　　心愿
    如果有人问高脚屋的哨兵们有啥心愿，他们会不加思索地回答：“洗个澡，吃一盘青菜足矣。”这些生活中最平常的需求，对高脚屋的战士们来说却是难得的享受。
    南沙气候炎热、潮湿。白天骄阳似火，礁盘就像盛满沸水的巨锅，高脚屋仿佛是锅上的蒸笼；夜晚，浓雾四合，高脚屋又变成水晶宫，到处湿漉漉的，被褥仿佛能攥出水来。这里远离大陆，新鲜蔬菜奇缺，严重影响了人们的食欲。为了保持体力，战士们想尽办法增加运动量。东门礁指导员游建国编导的《南沙哨兵舞》最受战士们欢迎。大伙学会的第一天便想跳个痛快。谁知刚刚跳了几分钟，人人热得汗水四溅。游建国只得高声宣布：“淡水有限，舞会停止。”想到每人每天仅有的半脸盆淡水，大伙的情绪才低落下来。
    于是人们盼望下雨。但老天像有意考验这些新到的主人似的，不但雨少，而且每次都来去匆匆。常常是不等人们洗完，便雨过天晴了。最难堪的是，你刚打上肥皂，雨却停了，弄得你哭笑不得。
    苦吗？是苦。但苦中有甜、有乐。每当战士们看到飘扬着五星红旗的商船从礁边驶过，看到来自祖国的捕鱼船队一天天多起来的时候，他们会从心底觉得自豪、欣慰，仿佛全部心愿都得到了满足。
