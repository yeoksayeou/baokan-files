In recent days, Buddhist, Taoist, Islamic, and Catholic religious figures in Beijing have been seriously studying and discussing Deng Xiaoping's important speech during his meeting with senior military officers of the capital's martial law troops. They expressed their support for Deng Xiaoping's important speech and the decisions made by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission to suppress the counter-revolutionary riots.

Zhao Puchu, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference and President of the Chinese Buddhist Association, who is currently in Shanghai for medical treatment, called to express his firm support for Deng Xiaoping's important speech and the line, policies, and principles established by the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. He said that the restoration and implementation of China's religious policies, and the active role played by various religions in the socialist construction of the motherland, are all thanks to the guidance of the line of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

The Chinese Taoist Association organized a series of meetings on June 15, 16, and 17 to have its standing committee members, committee members, Taoist figures, and association staff seriously study Deng Xiaoping's important speech. On June 17, the Standing Committee decided to conduct education among the broad masses of Taoists to love the Communist Party of China, love socialism, love the People's Liberation Army, abide by laws and regulations, not believe in or spread rumors, and maintain a stable and united political situation. Li Yuhang, President of the Chinese Taoist Association, who is currently in Shanghai, wrote a letter expressing his firm support for the various decisions made by the government since the turmoil and demanding that the government severely punish the ringleaders of the riots according to law.

In recent days, Islamic figures in Beijing have been seriously studying Deng Xiaoping's important speech. Everyone unanimously agreed that Deng Xiaoping's speech is far-sighted, has stabilized the overall situation, and pointed out the direction. The Chinese Islamic community and the broad masses of Muslims must, with high patriotic enthusiasm, firmly support the correct decisions of the Party and the government, and contribute to stabilizing the overall situation with practical actions. On June 17, Shen Jixi, President of the Chinese Islamic Association, led the entire staff of the Chinese Islamic Association and Islamic figures and Muslim masses from Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, and other provinces and regions who were self-funded to perform the Hajj in Saudi Arabia, totaling more than 60 people, to visit and comfort the capital's martial law troops.

On June 20, the Chinese Catholic Bishops' Conference, the Chinese Catholic Patriotic Association, and the Chinese Catholic Administrative Committee wrote a letter to the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the capital's martial law troops, expressing that Chinese Catholics will seriously study Deng Xiaoping's important speech and the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Entire Country" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. They will maintain a firm stance, hold high the banner, and be highly consistent with the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China politically. They will adhere to the four cardinal principles, adhere to the policy of independently managing the church, and make due contributions to maintaining the stability and unity of the motherland and the happiness and well-being of the people.
