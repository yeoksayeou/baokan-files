Older wives and younger husbands are becoming increasingly common in the United States. According to the U.S. Health Statistics Center, among approximately 2 million newlywed couples each year, 22% of the brides are older than their grooms. This figure was only 16% in 1970. The National Bureau of Statistics confirms that about 40% of women aged 35 to 40 have escaped marital difficulties by marrying men younger than themselves. Currently, the age difference between men and women is only a few years, but this gap appears to be widening.

Victoria Wright, a 42-year-old woman from Boston, is 9 years older than her husband. She says, "This type of marriage indicates that people's views on the age of a spouse have changed significantly; at the same time, people also have new ideas about what constitutes a happy marriage." A psychologist from New York believes that such marriages have actually freed both parties from mutual exploitation in terms of money and sex, reflecting a "highly equal gender relationship."

One of the reasons for the increase in older wives and younger husbands is that today's women are more financially independent and are less willing to marry a "sugar daddy" who can support them. Therefore, in the marriage model of older wives and younger husbands, white women with higher employment rates make up the majority.

Although such marriages have long been viewed as "evil" and "abnormal," some supporters seek scientific justification for this arrangement. They believe that, from a biological perspective, men reach their sexual peak around the age of 20, while women reach theirs around 30. This makes the sexual relationship in marriages with older wives and younger husbands more reasonable. Jessica, a 43-year-old fundraiser, says, "Since women live longer than men, such marriages are very meaningful."

Young men believe that marrying older women can reduce their economic and sexual burdens. Additionally, a mature female companion can help stabilize their emotions.

Marriages with older wives and younger husbands are not without their challenges. They must deal with ridicule and difficulties from family, friends, and colleagues. The issue of having children can also lead to marital discord. The age difference forces them to make decisive choices. If the wife misses her childbearing years because her husband does not want children in the near future, it will create more problems and crises.

For older wives and younger husbands, the most important thing is to eliminate doubts and build trust. In a recent article titled "Love for Younger Men," Houston states: "More than half of the couples will tell you that, due to the age difference, they do not believe their marriage can last long-term."

"Older wives" often have a sense of insecurity, always worried that their husbands will pursue younger women and abandon them. Many women admit that they often go to fitness clubs to exercise vigorously, in order to maintain their attractiveness to younger men. Some women say that, to attract a younger husband, they do not rule out the possibility of plastic surgery. Despite this, most women emphasize that maintaining harmony is more important than eliminating wrinkles in their future lives.

### 老妻少夫在美国

　　老妻少夫在美国
    老妻少夫的婚姻，在美国有日益增加的趋势。据美国健康统计中心估计，在每年约２００万对新婚夫妇中，有２２％的新娘比新郎年龄大。这种情况在１９７０年，仅占１６％。国家统计局证实，大约４０％的３５—４０岁的妇女，通过与比自己年轻的男子结婚，摆脱了婚姻上的困境。目前，男女之间年龄相差只有几岁，而这种差别似乎还在增大。
    波士顿妇女赖特·维多利亚，今年４２岁，比丈夫大９岁。她说：“这种婚配说明，人们对配偶的年龄的看法有了很大变化；同时，在什么样的婚姻才是美满的这一问题上，人们也有了新的观念。”纽约的一位心理学家认为，这种婚姻实际上已摆脱了双方在金钱和性方面的相互利用，体现出一种“极为平等的两性关系”。
    导致老妻少夫的原因之一是，今天的妇女自己能挣钱的很多，她们大都不愿违心地找个“富公”供养自己。因此，在老妻少夫的婚姻模式中，就业率更高的白人妇女占了多数。
    尽管长期以来，人们曾视这种婚姻是“邪恶的”、“反常的”，但有些持支持态度的人却为这种婚配寻找科学根据，他们认为，从生物学规律看，男子在２０岁左右达到性高峰期，女子则在３０岁左右进入高峰期。这么一来，老妻少夫的性关系就较为合理。４３岁的资金筹集人杰西卡说：“由于女人比男人长寿，所以这种婚姻是很有意义的。”
    年轻的男子则认为，与年龄大的女人结婚可以减轻自己在经济和性生活上承担的压力，另外，成熟的女伴还能使他们情绪安稳。
    老妻少夫的婚姻并不是十全十美的。他们必须对付来自家庭、朋友和同事的奚落和刁难。生孩子的问题也容易导致夫妇不和。年龄差距迫使他们不得不做出果断决定。因为如果妻子由于丈夫近几年不想要孩子而错过了生育年龄，就会造成更多的麻烦和危机。
    对老妻少夫来说，最重要的恐怕还是消除疑心，增强信任。豪斯顿在最近发表的《对年轻男子的爱》一文中说：“半数以上的夫妇都会告诉你，因为年龄的缘故，他们并不认为他们的婚姻能长期维持下去。”
    “老妻”们常有一种不安全感，总担心丈夫今后会去追求年轻女人而抛弃自己。许多妇女承认，她们经常到健身俱乐部刻苦锻炼，以保持对年轻男子的吸引力。有的妇女说，为了吸引年轻丈夫，她们不排除整容的可能。尽管如此，大多数妇女都强调，在今后的生活中，保持和谐比消除皱纹更重要。
