The 1989 Konica International Gymnastics Grand Prix left a strong impression: the difficulty of men's gymnastics is continually increasing, and the Soviet women's team has a clear advantage in both the difficulty and quality of their routines. This is the view of Yang Mingming, coach of the Chinese team, after participating in the Konica Gymnastics Grand Prix in Brisbane, Australia, as he shared with reporters.

Coach Yang said that this gymnastics competition was the largest and highest-level international event held since the 1988 Seoul Olympics. The participating athletes were generally of a high standard, with teams from the Soviet Union, East Germany, and others sending athletes who competed in the Seoul Olympics. The Chinese team's athletes were of a mid-to-high level. He said that the main purpose of the Chinese team participating in this international gymnastics competition was to train and test the team, observe the strength of other teams, and understand the technical developments of various teams since the 1988 Olympics.

Coach Yang said that although new compulsory routines were implemented this year, the men's teams, in addition to ensuring good performance of these compulsory routines, have made many new breakthroughs in the arrangement, innovation, and difficulty of their optional routines. In the vault competition, Soviet athletes used the tuck front double pike, considered the highest difficulty in this event today. Two out of the three Soviet male athletes could perform this move, and they did so with good stability. Additionally, in the horizontal bar competition, athletes from various countries used more over-the-bar and other flight moves compared to the Seoul Olympics. Soviet athlete Vorodiev's new connected moves on the horizontal bar—Tekachev salto, cross-grip to 180-degree turn, front flip to catch the bar, and triple backflip dismount—earned him the highest score of 9.95 in this competition.

He said that from this competition, some countries with mid-level gymnastics, such as Britain, Canada, and Italy, have seen rapid development in men's gymnastics in recent years. Some events, such as vault, parallel bars, and horizontal bar, have reached a high international level.

Coach Yang expressed satisfaction with the performance and results of the Chinese athletes in this competition. He said that in recent years, the overall level of the Chinese men's team has declined due to the retirement of a batch of veteran athletes. However, the emergence of athletes like Nong Qiang (gold medalist in men's floor exercise) in this competition is very encouraging. With further training, the Chinese men's team is expected to achieve good results in the World Gymnastics Championships in the latter half of this year and the Asian Games next year.

When discussing the women's team, Coach Yang believed that Yang Bo of the Chinese women's team performed exceptionally well in this competition and is a very promising athlete. She won two gold medals in the uneven bars and balance beam competitions, attracting the attention of coaches from various countries. Additionally, the two Chinese athletes, Luo Feng and Zhang Xia, although they still have some gaps compared to strong opponents from the Soviet Union and other countries, their performances show that these gaps can be narrowed.

He pointed out that in recent years, the difficulty of women's gymnastics routines has also been increasing. The difficulty of the floor exercise can now be compared to men's routines. In this competition, many female athletes from various countries used moves starting with a straight body double backflip and ending with a straight body double backflip with a 180-degree turn. The flight moves on the uneven bars, such as a double-arm giant and a 360-degree turn, also appeared frequently. Coach Yang believed that in recent years, the difficulty of women's gymnastics in countries like the United States and Canada has significantly improved, but their stability is not sufficient.

### 奥运会后的新检阅——杨明明评国际体操大奖赛

　　奥运会后的新检阅    
    ——杨明明评国际体操大奖赛
    １９８９年柯尼卡国际体操大奖赛给人一个较为突出的印象是，男子体操难度还在不断提高，苏联女队在动作难度和完成质量上占有明显优势。这是中国队教练杨明明在澳大利亚布里斯班参加了柯尼卡体操大奖赛后对记者谈他对这次比赛的看法。
    杨教练说，这次体操赛是自去年汉城奥运会以来所举行的规模最大水平较高的一次国际性比赛，参赛队员的水平普遍都比较高，苏联、民主德国等队都派出了参加汉城奥运会的选手。中国队参赛队员的水平属中上等。他说，中国队参加这次国际体操赛的目的，主要是为了锻炼、检验队伍，观察各队的实力，了解自去年奥运会以来各队在技术上的新发展。
    杨教练说，尽管从今年开始实行新的规定动作，但各男队在保证较好完成这些规定动作外，在自选动作的编排、创新以及难度上又有许多新的突破。苏联选手在跳马比赛中，采用了团身前空翻两周这个被认为这个项目当今最高难度的动作，参赛的三名苏联男选手中有两人能做，并且稳定性较好。另外，在单杠比赛中，各国运动员采用的越杠以及其它飞行动作，比去年奥运会期间相比更多了。苏联队的沃罗杰夫在单杠比赛中采用的新的连接动作——特卡切夫腾跃、交叉握杠接转体１８０度、再接前空翻抓杠、三周空翻下，获本次比赛的最高分９．９５分。
    他说，从这次比赛看，有些体操水平属中等的国家，如英国、加拿大、意大利等国的男子体操水平近年来发展较快，有些项目，如跳马、双杠、单杠已达到了较高的国际水平。
    杨教练对中国队员在这次比赛中的表现以及所取得的成绩表示满意，并说，近年来中国男队由于一批老队员的退役，总的水平有所下降，但这次比赛中出现了像侬强（男子自由体操金牌获得者）这样一些有希望的队员是很可喜的。如能进一步抓好训练，中国男队可望在今年下半年的世界体操锦标赛和明年的亚运会上取得好成绩。
    杨教练谈到女队时认为，中国女队的杨波在这次比赛中成绩突出，是个很有希望的运动员。她在高低杠和平衡木比赛中一人夺得两枚金牌，引起了各国教练的注意。另外，两名参赛的中国选手罗峰和张霞，虽然同苏联等国的强手相比还有一定的差距，但从她们的表现来看，这些差距有希望缩小。
    他指出，近年来女子体操动作的难度也在不断提高，自由体操的难度已可同男子动作相比，在这次比赛中，许多国家的女运动员在自由体操比赛中采用直体后空翻两周开始，直体后空翻两周转体１８０度结束，高低杠上的飞行动作双臂大回环接转体３６０度的动作也不断出现。杨教练认为，近年来美国、加拿大等国的女子体操在动作难度上有较大提高，但稳定性显得不够。
