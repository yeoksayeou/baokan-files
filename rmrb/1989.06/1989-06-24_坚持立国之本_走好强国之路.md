In the context of achieving decisive victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China was convened. The meeting primarily discussed the errors made by Comrade Zhao Ziyang in supporting the anti-party and anti-socialist turmoil and in his leadership of the Central Committee, and revoked his positions as General Secretary of the Central Committee, member of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau, member of the Political Bureau, member of the Central Committee, and First Vice Chairman of the Central Military Commission. The plenary session also made necessary adjustments to some members of the central leadership, forming a new leadership core of the Party Central Committee. This plenary session resolved urgent issues that needed to be addressed to further suppress the turmoil, stabilize the national situation, consolidate the Party's leadership, maintain the unity of the entire Party, and the unity between the Party and the people, and also resolved the major issue of continuing to advance along the line of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. This is a very important meeting with far-reaching influence in the historical development of our Party.

Over the past two months, our Party has undergone a severe political test. A small number of individuals exploited student movements to instigate a planned, organized, and premeditated political turmoil, which then escalated into a counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, attempting to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subvert the socialist People's Republic of China. The occurrence and development of this turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot have deep international backgrounds and domestic social foundations. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, "This turmoil was bound to happen. It was determined by the international climate and China's own small climate, and it was inevitable, regardless of people's will." In this struggle concerning the fate of the Party, the nation, and the people, our Party resolutely resisted and overcame the errors of Comrade Zhao Ziyang in supporting the turmoil and splitting the Party, adopted correct policies, decisions, and a series of decisive measures, and finally won the victory. This shows that the Communist Party of China is indeed a great party, a party armed with Marxism, and a party representing the interests of the Chinese people. It also shows that the broad masses of workers, peasants, and intellectuals are conscious, firmly oppose the turmoil and counter-revolutionary riot, and support the Party and government's necessary and correct decisions. In particular, the People's Liberation Army, as the strong pillar of the republic, made tremendous contributions in this struggle, winning high honor and the heartfelt love of the people. The struggle has given us profound lessons and also given us full confidence. As long as the Party's leadership is strong, and as long as the entire Party, the entire military, and all ethnic groups of the country unite as one, any difficulties encountered in the process of advancing can be overcome, and any plots to sabotage and subvert the socialist system can be defeated.

After the storm, the Party is calmly reflecting, the Chinese people are calmly reflecting, and the whole world is closely watching: Where is China heading? Some people say: China's reform and opening up will be "reversed," will "retreat"! The key question is: Should the line of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee of the Communist Party of China still be adhered to? Should the basic line of "one center, two basic points" summarized by the Thirteenth Party Congress still be adhered to? Some people have doubts in their minds, and domestic and foreign forces hostile to us have taken the opportunity to create various confusing public opinions. Just a few days after achieving initial victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot, Comrade Deng Xiaoping clearly answered this question. In his speech to military officers above the rank of division during the martial law period, he pointed out, "We will continue to implement the basic line, policies, and principles we originally formulated, and we will do so steadfastly and unshakably." The great significance of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee also lies in the fact that the session reaffirmed that the line, policies, and principles of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee are correct, and that the basic line of "one center, two basic points" proposed by the Thirteenth Party Congress is correct. The Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the state and must be adhered to unshakably and consistently; reform and opening up are the path to a strong nation and must be implemented steadfastly and unremittingly, and we must not return to the old path of closing the door to the outside world. The Party will, on the basis of summing up experience, adhere to the correct parts, rectify the erroneous parts, and strengthen the insufficient parts. After serious rectification and adjustment, we will make our construction and reform and opening-up cause even more stable, better, and even faster. This is our resolve and direction.

The Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up, the foundation of the state and the path to a strong nation, are indispensable. The ten years of reform practice and the two months of turmoil have made the Party and the people realize, recognize, and affirm these two basic points. The Central Committee will not change them, and the people will not allow them to be changed. We must draw lessons from the turmoil, conduct education on adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, and seriously and solidly make up for this lesson. This is completely necessary, but it does not mean that we can relax reform and opening up. Adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and adhering to reform and opening up are complementary and mutually reinforcing. By clearly adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles, we aim to give our construction, which takes developing productive forces as the center, and our reform and opening up, a clear direction, a stable social environment, and the high cohesion and initiative of the people. In a word, it is for the country to become increasingly prosperous.

The Chinese people's choice of the socialist path is a historical necessity; building socialism requires the path of reform and opening up, which is also a historical necessity. Forty years of experience, both positive and negative, have proven that to give full play to the superiority of the socialist system, we must continuously carry out reforms, through reforms to make the socialist system self-improve and self-develop; we must implement opening up to the outside world, through opening up to absorb everything beneficial to us from the world, and enhance the strength of socialism. To make our country strong, we must take the path of reform and opening up. Imagine, if there were no reform and opening up, if we still adhered to the old system and closed the door to the outside world, how could we have today's situation? Adhering to the line of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee means adhering to reform and opening up. If we abandon reform and opening up, people's thoughts will inevitably be shackled again, social productive forces and all new things will be suppressed, a prosperous and lively economy will be stifled again, a lively and dynamic political situation will become dull and lifeless, the path to the five continents and four seas will be blocked, and China will return to the shackles of old ideas and old systems, "realizing the four modernizations and revitalizing China" will become an empty slogan. This is a situation that our Party and people do not want to see.

Today in China, no one has any reason to change the policy of reform and opening up. Reform and opening up represent the fundamental interests of the people. In the ten years of reform and opening up, although some mistakes were made and a certain price was paid, the vast majority of Chinese people have nevertheless benefited from reform and opening up in an unprecedented way, seeing the great trend of reform and opening up in line with the world tide and in line with the hearts of the Party and the people. Therefore, our people firmly support reform and opening up. Even those with ulterior motives during the counter-revolutionary riot did not dare to openly advocate opposing reform and opening up, instead trying to use the banner of reform to deceive people. The Communist Party is a party that struggles for the interests of the people. Reform and opening up is the Party's established policy. The Party will not only not change this policy but will also continue to deepen the reform and opening up, to be bolder and more decisive in reform and opening up. As long as we adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles and adhere to reform and opening up, we have great hope in building a prosperous socialist country.

The socialist cause of China is led by the Communist Party of China. We firmly believe that the central leadership, after adjustments made by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, as a strong leadership collective of the Party, as the core of the unity of the entire Party and all the people of the country, will definitely lead us to adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles and steadfastly walk the path of reform and opening up to a strong nation.

### 坚持立国之本　走好强国之路

　　坚持立国之本　走好强国之路
    在平息北京反革命暴乱取得决定性胜利的形势下，中国共产党第十三届中央委员会召开了第四次全体会议。会议主要讨论了赵紫阳同志在反党反社会主义的动乱中和主持中央工作以来所犯的错误，撤销了他的中央委员会总书记、中央政治局常务委员会委员、中央政治局委员、中央委员会委员和中共中央军事委员会第一副主席的职务。全会还对中央领导机构的部分成员进行了必要的调整，形成了党中央的新的领导核心。这次全会，解决了当前进一步平息动乱和稳定全国局势、巩固党的领导、维护全党的团结和党与人民的团结需要解决的紧迫问题，也解决了沿着十一届三中全会路线继续前进的大问题。这是我们党的历史发展上的一次具有深远影响的非常重要的会议。
    近两个月来，我们的党经受了一次严峻的政治考验。极少数人利用学潮，掀起了一场有计划、有组织、有预谋的政治动乱，进而在北京发展成了反革命暴乱，企图推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义的中华人民共和国。这场动乱和反革命暴乱的发生和发展，有着深刻的国际背景和国内社会基础。正如邓小平同志所说：“这场风波迟早要来。这是国际的大气候和中国自己的小气候所决定了的，是一定要来的，是不以人们的意志为转移的”。在这场关系到党的命运、国家命运、人民命运的惊心动魄的斗争中，我们的党坚决抵制和克服了赵紫阳同志支持动乱和分裂党的错误，采取了正确的方针、决策和一系列果断的措施，终于夺取了斗争的胜利。这说明中国共产党不愧为伟大的党，不愧为马克思主义武装起来的党，不愧为代表中国人民利益的党。也说明广大工人、农民、知识分子是有觉悟的，是坚决反对动乱和反革命暴乱的，是拥护党和政府必要和正确的决策的。特别是作为共和国坚强柱石的人民解放军，在这场斗争中作出了巨大贡献，赢得了崇高的荣誉和人民由衷的爱戴。斗争给了我们以深刻的教训，也给了我们以充分的信心，只要党的领导坚强有力，只要全党、全军、全国各族人民团结一致，任何前进中的困难都是能够克服的，任何破坏、颠覆社会主义制度的阴谋都是能够战胜的。
    风雨过后，党在冷静地思考，中国人民在冷静地思考，全世界也正密切地注视：中国向何处去？有人说：中国的改革开放要“收”了，要“倒退”了！问题的关键在于：中国共产党十一届三中全会的路线还要不要继续坚持，十三大概括的“一个中心、两个基本点”还要不要继续坚持？人们思想上出现一些疑虑，国内外敌视我们的人也乘机制造了种种混淆黑白的舆论。在取得平息反革命暴乱初步胜利后仅仅几天，邓小平同志就明确回答了这个问题。他在接见戒严部队军以上干部的讲话中指出：“我们原来制定的基本路线、方针、政策，照样干下去，坚定不移地干下去。”党的十三届四中全会的重大意义，也在于会议重申了党的十一届三中全会的路线、方针和政策是正确的，党的十三大提出的“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线是正确的。四项基本原则是立国之本，必须毫不动摇、始终一贯地加以坚持；改革开放是强国之路，必须坚定不移、一如既往地贯彻执行，绝不回到闭关锁国的老路上去。党将要在总结经验的基础上，坚持正确的部分，纠正失误的部分，加强不足的部分，在经过认真的治理整顿之后，把我们的建设和改革开放事业搞得比过去更稳，更好，甚至更快。这就是我们的决心，我们的方向。
    四个坚持和改革开放，立国之本和强国之路，是缺一不可的。十年改革的实践，两个月动乱的教训，使党和人民认清了，认准了，也认定了这两个基本点，中央不会改变它，人民也不允许改变它。我们吸取暴乱造成的教训，进行坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的教育，认真地、扎实地补好这一课，这是完全必要的，但是，这丝毫也不意味着可以放松改革开放。坚持四项基本原则和坚持改革开放是相辅相成，互为保证的。旗帜鲜明地坚持四项基本原则，目的是使我们以发展生产力为中心的建设事业，使我们的改革开放，有明确的方向，有稳定的社会环境，有人民的高度的凝聚力和积极性。一句话，是为了国家的日益富强。
    中国人民选择社会主义道路，是历史的必然；建设社会主义要走改革开放之路，也是历史的必然。四十年来正反两个方面的经验都证明，要发挥社会主义制度的优越性，必须不断进行改革，通过改革使社会主义制度自我完善，自我发展；必须实行对外开放，通过对外开放，吸取世界上一切对我有益的东西，增强社会主义的实力。要使我们的国家富强起来，必须走改革开放之路。试想，如果没有改革开放，还固守旧的体制，还闭关锁国，哪有今天的局面？坚持党的十一届三中全会路线，就要坚持改革开放。如果放弃了改革开放，人们的思想必然将会重新被禁锢，社会生产力和一切新生事物将会被压制，繁荣活跃的经济将会重新被统死，生动活泼的政治局面将会变得死气沉沉，通向五洲四海的途径将会被阻塞，中国将重新回到旧思想、旧体制的束缚中去，“实现四化，振兴中华”将成为一句空话。这种情况是我们党和人民决不愿看到的。
    今天在中国，谁也没有理由去改变改革开放的方针。改革开放代表了人民的根本利益，在十年的改革开放中，虽然也出现了一些失误，付出了一定代价，但绝大多数中国人毕竟从改革开放中得到了前所未有的好处，看到了改革开放顺乎世界潮流、符合党心民心的大趋势，所以，我们的人民坚决支持改革开放。甚至反革命暴乱中那些别有用心的人，也不敢冒大不韪喊出反对改革开放的口号，相反要接过改革的口号以售其奸。共产党是为人民利益而奋斗的党，改革开放是党的既定方针，党不仅不会改变这个方针，而且要继续深化改革，深化开放，要更大胆、更放手去改革开放。只要坚持四项基本原则，又坚持改革开放，我们建设富强的社会主义国家就大有希望。
    中国的社会主义事业是由中国共产党领导的。我们坚信，经过十三届四中全会调整后的中央领导机构，作为党的坚强的领导集体，作为全党和全国人民紧密团结的核心，一定能够领导我们坚持四项基本原则，坚定不移地走改革开放的强国之路。
