Greek Election Results Announced

New Democracy Defeats Ruling PASOK

According to Xinhua News Agency in Athens on June 19, the latest election results announced by the Greek Ministry of the Interior today at noon indicate that the largest opposition party, New Democracy, defeated the ruling Panhellenic Socialist Movement in the national parliamentary elections held on June 18. Although New Democracy is in a clear lead in terms of votes, it has not secured the absolute majority needed to form a government on its own.

So far, the Greek Ministry of the Interior has completed the counting of 82% of the votes nationwide. The results show that the center-right New Democracy has received 44.52% of the votes and can secure 144 seats in the 300-seat national parliament. However, it is still short of 5 seats to form a government on its own.

According to the new Greek election law passed at the end of March this year, only a party that wins more than 46% of the votes is eligible to form a government on its own. However, the New Democracy election headquarters has announced that the party has the ability to form a government.

The Panhellenic Socialist Movement, led by Prime Minister Papandreou, currently has 39.10% of the votes. Local political observers believe that the main reason for PASOK's defeat this time is that since last autumn, Prime Minister Papandreou has been plagued by scandals in his private life. A large number of PASOK government officials are involved in "the largest post-war economic scandal in Greece," which has led to a sharp decline in their credibility among voters.

Early this morning, Papandreou, the Prime Minister, made a televised speech from his villa in the northern suburbs of Athens, acknowledging that PASOK has failed in the general election and has been demoted to Greece's second-largest party for the first time in eight years.

Xinhua News Agency, Athens, June 19. After the Panhellenic Socialist Movement led by Greek Prime Minister Papandreou suffered a defeat in the general election, Papandreou submitted his government's resignation to President Satsetakis in the afternoon of June 19.

Papandreou said that the President asked him to remain as acting Prime Minister until a new government is formed.

New Democracy leader Konstantinos Mitsotakis said on the evening of June 19 that he would start forming an interim government and called on all political forces in Greece to support the investigation of the economic scandals of the Papandreou government.

If Mitsotakis cannot form a new government within 3 days, PASOK will be given the same period to form a new government.

If both major parties fail to form a new government on time, an interim government with representatives from the major parties will be formed, and new elections will be held within 6 weeks.

### 希腊大选揭晓  新民主党击败执政的泛希社运

　　希腊大选揭晓    
    新民主党击败执政的泛希社运
    据新华社雅典６月１９日电（记者周锡生）据希腊内政部今天中午公布的最新选举结果，最大反对党新民主党在１８日举行的全国议会选举中击败了执政的泛希腊社会主义运动，得票处于明显领先的地位，但未能赢得单独组阁所需的绝对多数票。
    到目前为止，希内政部对全国８２％的选票已经统计完毕，结果表明，属中右派的新民主党得票４４．５２％，在３００席的全国议会中可得１４４席。但尚差５席才能单独组阁。
    根据今年３月底通过的希腊新选举法，只有赢得４６％以上选票的政党才有资格单独组阁，但新民主党竞选总部已宣布该党有能力组成政府。
    由帕潘德里欧总理领导的泛希社运目前得选票３９．１０％。此间政治观察家认为，泛希社运这次遭受失败的主要原因在于，自去年秋天以来，帕潘德里欧总理一直被其私生活丑闻所困扰，一大批泛希社运政府官员同“希腊战后最大的一桩经济丑闻”有牵连，在选民中威信陡降。
    今天凌晨，帕潘德里欧总理在雅典北郊的别墅中发表电视讲话，承认泛希社运已在大选中失败，８年来首次退居希腊第二大党。
    新华社雅典６月１９日电　希腊总理帕潘德里欧在他领导的泛希腊社会主义运动在大选中遭到失败后，１９日下午向总统萨采塔基斯提出政府辞呈。
    帕潘德里欧说，总统要求他在新政府组成之前留任看守总理。
    新民主党领导人康斯坦丁诺斯·米佐塔基斯１９日晚上表示，他将着手成立一个临时政府，并呼吁在希腊所有政治力量的支持下，把帕潘德里欧政府的经济丑闻查个水落石出。
    如果米佐塔基斯在３天之内没有能够成立新政府，那么，泛希社运将得到同样的期限来成立一个新政府。
    如果两个主要政党均未能如期成立新政府，就将成立一个有各主要政党代表参加的看守政府，并在６周内举行新的大选。
