Lack of Plastic Film and Fertilizer Hinders Implementation of Poverty Alleviation Program

According to the Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on June 2, it is reported that the "Poverty Alleviation Program" implemented in national poverty-stricken areas this year is expected to complete only 62% of the planned area.

It is understood that the "Poverty Alleviation Program" refers to the hybrid corn plastic film coverage increase production plan implemented in high-altitude cold regions and arid areas. This plan involves 375 impoverished counties in 16 provinces and autonomous regions nationwide, with a task of promoting 7.45 million mu this year, and it is expected to complete 4.63 million mu.

Providing plastic film, special fertilizers, and matching technologies in a timely manner at affordable prices is the key to implementing the "Poverty Alleviation Program." This year, the required special plastic film has only been secured at 20,000 tons, with a shortfall of 10,000 tons; the existing plastic film that meets quality standards accounts for 60%, with prices exceeding 9,000 yuan per ton. In addition, the state's special fertilizers have not yet been allocated. If the mid-June top-dressing period is missed, it will inevitably affect the increase in production.

　　贫困地区缺少地膜化肥
    实施温饱工程遇到困难
    据新华社北京６月２日电  （记者鹿永建）记者从农业部获悉：在国家贫困地区实施的“温饱工程”，今年预计只能完成计划面积的６２％。
    据了解，“温饱工程”指在高寒山区和干旱地区实施的杂交玉米地膜覆盖增产计划。这一计划涉及全国１６个省、自治区的３７５个贫困县，今年的推广任务是７４５万亩，预计可完成４６３万亩。
    适时提供平价地膜、专项化肥和配套技术，是实施“温饱工程”的关键。今年各地所需的专用地膜只落实了２万吨，缺口为１万吨；现有的地膜符合质量标准的占６０％，价格高达每吨９０００元以上。此外，国家专项化肥目前尚未下达，如果误过了６月中旬的追肥期，势必影响增产效果。
