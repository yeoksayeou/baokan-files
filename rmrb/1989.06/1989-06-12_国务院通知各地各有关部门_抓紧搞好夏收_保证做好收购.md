Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 9th.

The State Council on June 9th issued a notice to local governments and relevant departments regarding the expediting of the summer harvest and ensuring the procurement of summer grains and oils.

The notice states: Currently, the summer grain-producing regions from south to north have entered the busy season of summer harvest and summer planting. To effectively carry out the summer harvest and ensure the procurement of summer grains, oils, and other agricultural products, the following instructions are issued:

1. **Expedite Summer Harvest, Summer Threshing, and Summer Planting**. This year's summer grain crops are thriving, and from a national perspective, increased production is already assured. With the summer harvest approaching, local governments at all levels should organize relevant departments to work closely together, mobilize a large number of cadres and the masses to prioritize the supply of electricity, machinery, and other materials needed for summer harvest, summer threshing, and summer planting. All other needs must give way to these "three summers." The battle of the "three summers" must be won without delay.

2. **Ensure Funding for Summer Grain and Oil Procurement to Avoid Issuing IOUs**. All levels of government must resolutely implement the spirit of the State Council's telegram on May 22nd. Local government leaders must take responsibility, strengthen leadership, and organize banks, commercial (grain), and financial departments to study and implement measures at all levels to raise funds. These funds must be concentrated on the procurement of grains, oils, and other agricultural products. It must be fully recognized that if IOUs are issued again during the summer procurement, it will seriously affect farmers' enthusiasm for production, especially for grain cultivation, and directly impact autumn agricultural production. This will be detrimental to the overall national economy. Banks, auditing, commercial administration, and supervisory departments at all levels must actively cooperate. Wherever IOUs are found, the causes must be thoroughly investigated, and solutions must be found quickly. Places that have resolved procurement funding issues should be commended.

3. **Further Strengthen Propaganda and Education**. Governments and relevant departments at all levels must conduct extensive and in-depth propaganda and education. Farmers must understand that contract procurement is both an economic contract and a national task. Completing contract procurement is a duty that farmers must fulfill and must be ensured to contribute more to the country.

　　国务院通知各地各有关部门
    抓紧搞好夏收
    保证做好收购
    新华社北京电  国务院６月９日向各地各有关部门发出《关于抓紧搞好夏收、保证做好夏季粮油收购工作的通知》。
    《通知》说：目前夏粮产区从南向北已经进入夏收、夏种大忙季节，为了切实搞好夏收，保证做好夏季粮油和其它农副产品收购工作，特再作如下通知：
    一、抓紧搞好夏收、夏打、夏种生产。今年夏粮长势喜人，从全国来看增产已成定局。夏收在即，希望地方各级人民政府组织有关部门密切配合，动员广大干部和群众优先保证夏收、夏打、夏种所需的电力、机械设备和其它物资，不失时机地打好“三夏”这一仗。其它方面的需要都要为“三夏”让路。
    二、千方百计保证夏季粮油收购所需资金，避免出现收购农副产品“打白条”现象。各级人民政府要坚决贯彻５月２２日国务院的电报通知精神，地方人民政府负责人要切实负起责任，加强领导，组织银行、商业（粮食）、财政等有关部门层层研究落实，想方设法筹措资金，集中用于粮油等农副产品收购。要充分认识到，如果在夏季收购中再出现“打白条”现象，将会严重影响农民发展生产特别是种粮的积极性，也直接影响秋季农业生产，对国民经济全局极为不利。各级银行、审计、工商管理和监察部门要主动配合，凡是发现有“打白条”现象的地方，要认真查明原因，迅速设法解决。对那些收购资金解决好的地方要进行表扬。
    三、进一步做好宣传教育工作。各级政府和有关部门要广泛、深入进行宣传和教育工作。要使农民理解，合同定购既是经济合同，也是国家任务，完成合同定购是农民应尽的义务，必须保证完成，为国家多作贡献。
