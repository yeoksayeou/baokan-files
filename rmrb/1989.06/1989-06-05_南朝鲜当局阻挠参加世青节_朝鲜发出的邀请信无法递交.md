Our reporter Xu Baokang reports from Pyongyang on June 1: The representative of the Standing Committee of the International Organizing Committee for the 13th World Youth Festival today went to Panmunjom to hand over a letter to the South Korean side. Due to the obstruction by the South Korean authorities, the letter could not be delivered.

The representative of the Standing Committee of the International Organizing Committee arrived at the meeting room of the Neutral Nations Supervisory Commission at Panmunjom at 3 PM today with the letter. Due to the unreasonable obstruction by the South Korean authorities, the South Korean student representative was unable to go to Panmunjom. Therefore, the letter could not be handed over to the South Korean student representative.
