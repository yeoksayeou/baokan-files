Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 21st.

Li Peng, Premier of the State Council, met with Humayun Khan, the Foreign Secretary of Pakistan, who is in Beijing for vice-ministerial consultations between China and Pakistan, this afternoon in the Zhongnanhai Ziguang Pavilion. Li Peng stated: Our policy of reform and opening up will not change; our independent and peaceful foreign policy will not change; we will continue to develop friendly relations with all countries on the basis of the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, and this will not change either. He said, I am optimistic about China's future.

At the beginning of the meeting, Humayun first conveyed warm greetings from Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto to Premier Li Peng, saying that Benazir Bhutto looks forward to Li Peng's visit to Pakistan. Premier Li Peng also sent his greetings to Benazir Bhutto and expressed his willingness to visit Pakistan as scheduled.

When introducing the current domestic situation in China, Li Peng said, "It takes three feet of ice to freeze, and it doesn't happen in a single day." The recent events in Beijing, from student protests to turmoil, from turmoil to riots, have deep domestic and international backgrounds. The key is that both domestically and internationally, there are people who do not like our socialist system and the leadership of the Communist Party. In China, a developing country with 1.1 billion people, people believe that only under the leadership of the Communist Party can we truly overcome poverty and backwardness.

Li Peng said, we strictly distinguish between two types of contradictions. For a small number of criminals who have violated the law, we will handle the matter completely according to the law and legal procedures. For the majority who participated in marches, demonstrations, sit-ins, and hunger strikes, even if they had excessive behavior, we will adopt a lenient attitude and handle the matter properly.

Li Peng said, the Chinese government is stable and has the ability to completely quell the riots and stabilize the situation. In fact, Beijing has now basically returned to normal, and the situation across the country is also stable.

Li Peng went on to say, "A strong wind reveals the sturdy grass, and a long journey reveals the strength of the horse." At this moment when China is facing temporary difficulties, it is clear who are true friends and who are false friends. He said, some countries are applying diplomatic and economic pressure on China, interfering in China's internal affairs, which is a shortsighted and unwise move. We believe that once they understand the truth, many people will change their views.

Both hosts and guests also exchanged views on international issues such as Afghanistan and Cambodia.

　　李鹏会见巴基斯坦客人时强调    
    中国不会屈服于外来压力    
    将继续在和平共处五项原则基础上同各国发展关系
    本报北京６月２１日讯  国务院总理李鹏今天下午在中南海紫光阁会见正在北京参加中巴副外长磋商的巴基斯坦外交秘书胡马云·汗时表示：我们的改革开放政策不会改变；我们的独立自主的和平外交政策不会改变；我们将继续在和平共处五项原则的基础上同各国发展友好关系，这一点也不会改变。他说，我对中国的前途持乐观态度。
    会见开始时，胡马云首先转达了贝·布托总理对李鹏总理的热烈问候，他说，贝·布托总理期待着李鹏总理前往巴基斯坦进行访问。李鹏总理也问候了贝·布托总理，并表示他将愉快地按照双方商定的日期访问巴基斯坦。
    李鹏向客人介绍了当前中国国内的情况时说，“冰冻三尺，非一日之寒”。北京最近发生的从学潮到动乱，从动乱到暴乱的事件，有着深刻的国内和国际背景。关键是国内和国外都有人不喜欢我们的社会主义制度和共产党的领导。而在中国这样一个有１１亿人口的发展中大国，人们认定只有在共产党的领导下走社会主义道路才能真正摆脱贫困和落后。
    李鹏说，我们严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。对一小部分触犯刑律的犯罪分子，我们将完全按照法律和法律程序办事。对大多数参加过游行、示威、静坐和绝食的人，即使是有过过激的言行，我们也将采取宽厚的态度，妥善处理。
    李鹏说，中国政府是稳定的，完全有能力彻底平息暴乱，稳定局势。事实上现在北京已基本上恢复正常，全国的形势也是稳定的。
    李鹏接着说，“疾风知劲草，路遥知马力”。在中国遇到暂时困难的时刻，谁是真朋友，谁是假朋友，就看的很清楚了。他说，经过长期斗争站立起来的中国人民是不会屈服于任何外来压力的。现在有些国家在外交上、经济上对中国施加压力，干涉中国的内政，这是目光短浅、不明智的表现。我们相信，一旦了解了事情的真相，许多人是会改变他们的看法的。
    宾主双方还就阿富汗、柬埔寨等国际问题交换了看法。（附图片）
