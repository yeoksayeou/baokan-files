Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly Election Begins

    BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) — The election campaign for the Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly officially started today, with voters set to cast their ballots to evaluate Japan's current political landscape.

    This election is the first major poll since the formation of the Uno Cabinet. With approximately 9 million voters in Tokyo, accounting for about one-tenth of the national electorate, the results will have significant representativeness and influence subsequent elections. All parties are fully engaged, actively canvassing voters.

    Prime Minister Uno, who also serves as the president of the Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), braved the rain today to deliver a passionate speech in front of the LDP headquarters: "Regarding the Recruit scandal, which is of utmost concern to the public, LDP members sincerely reflect and deeply feel the weight of our responsibility. We are determined to push forward political reforms and respond to the public's trust."

    Leaders of opposition parties also took to the streets to deliver speeches, urging voters to use their ballots to judge the LDP's misrule and change Japan's political tide.

    The Tokyo Metropolitan Assembly election is crucial for the Uno Cabinet, as it will significantly impact next month's House of Councillors election. Therefore, the outcome will determine the stability of the Uno Cabinet.

　　日东京都议员选举拉开序幕
    本报东京６月２３日电  记者于青报道：东京都议员选举活动今天正式开始，选民们将用选票来评价当今日本政治。
    这次选举是宇野内阁问世以来的第一次大型选举。都内９００万选民，约占全国的十分之一，既有较大代表性，又对以后的选举有波及效应，各党全力以赴，四出游说选民。
    身兼自民党总裁的首相宇野今天冒雨在自民党本部前慷慨陈词：“对于国民最关心的利库路特事件，自民党人诚心反省，痛感责任重大。决心推进政治改革，回答国民的信赖。”
    在野党各党首脑也纷纷在街头讲演，要求选民用选票审判自民党恶政，改变日本的政治潮流。
    东京都议员选举对宇野内阁十分重要，因为它将严重影响下月的参院选举，所以胜负关系到宇野内阁是否稳定。
