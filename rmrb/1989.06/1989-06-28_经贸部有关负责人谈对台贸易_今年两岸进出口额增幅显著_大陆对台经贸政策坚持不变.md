An official from the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation stated that the mainland's economic and trade policies towards Taiwan will not be affected by temporary incidents. Economic and trade exchanges between the two sides are in line with public sentiment and the interests of the entire nation, and there is every reason to make them better, faster, more stable, and more comprehensive.

An, Min, Deputy Director of the Taiwan Affairs Office of the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation, told a reporter from this newspaper that China's reform and opening-up policy is a fundamental policy that has been summarized over many years and cannot be changed. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee of the Communist Party of China clearly and firmly emphasized this point. Therefore, the mainland's economic and trade policies towards Taiwan remain unchanged and will strive to implement the current policies and seriously address practical issues.

He explained that the economic and trade exchanges between the two sides are mutually complementary and beneficial. This fact has not changed. This year, both imports and exports between the two sides have seen significant growth. In the first four months of this year, the trade volume between the two sides through Hong Kong reached $1.144 billion, a 64% increase over the same period last year. Of this, the mainland's imports from Taiwan amounted to $949 million, and exports amounted to $194 million, representing a 73% and 31% increase over the same period last year, respectively. He said that we will seriously implement the "Regulations of the State Council on Encouraging Investment by Compatriots from Taiwan" to address specific issues that have arisen in the investment by compatriots from Taiwan, to manage well the existing joint ventures, to continue to focus on improving product quality and contract performance, to improve the foreign trade environment, and to clean up unqualified foreign trade companies. He also stated that the Ministry of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation is preparing to organize some scarce commodities to further expand exports to Taiwan.

An Min said that some Taiwanese businessmen have some doubts about the recent events in Beijing, which is understandable. Having doubts means there is a need and expectation. Some people may adopt a wait-and-see attitude in the short term, but once they understand the facts and realize that our consistent policies have not changed, more people will come to the mainland to invest, set up factories, and do business. In fact, Guangdong and Fujian, where Taiwanese investment is most concentrated, have been basically unaffected, and the commercial activities of Taiwanese businessmen remain very active.

An Min revealed that after June 4, some large-scale Taiwanese investment projects are still being actively negotiated, and large-scale economic and trade consultation activities between enterprises on both sides are also being actively planned. He expressed respect for these far-sighted Taiwanese businessmen and believed that with the joint efforts of compatriots on both sides, economic and trade exchanges and cooperation between the two sides can develop more rapidly.

　　经贸部有关负责人谈对台贸易    
    今年两岸进出口额增幅显著  大陆对台经贸政策坚持不变
    本报北京６月２８日讯  经贸部一位主管对台贸易的官员表示，大陆对台经贸政策不会因暂时的突发事件而受影响。两岸经贸往来符合民心，符合全民族的利益，只有理由做得更好、更快、更稳、更完善。
    经贸部对台经贸关系司副司长安民对本报记者发表谈话说，我国的改革开放政策是多年来总结出的基本政策，没必要也不可能改变。中共十三届四中全会非常坚定、明确地强调了这一点。因此，大陆对台经贸政策坚持不变，将努力贯彻现行政策，并且认真解决现实问题。
    他解释说，两岸经贸往来是互补互益的关系，现在，这个事实并没有任何变化。今年两岸贸易进、出口都有较大增长，今年前４个月，经香港的两岸贸易额已达１１．４４亿美元，比去年同期增长６４％，其中大陆从台湾进口占９．４９亿美元，出口占１．９４亿美元，分别比去年同期增长７３％和３１％。他说，我们将认真贯彻执行《国务院关于鼓励台湾同胞投资的规定》，解决好台胞投资中出现的一些具体问题，把现有的合资企业办好，继续重视提高商品质量、提高履约率，改善外贸经济环境，清理不合格的外贸公司。他表示，经贸部还准备组织一些紧俏物资，努力扩大对台出口。
    安民说，一些台湾商人对前一段北京发生的事情有些疑虑，这是可以理解的。有疑虑，说明有需求，有期望。近期有些人可能采取观望态度，等了解了事实真相，明白了我们的一贯政策并没有改变，相信会有更多的人来大陆投资办厂，做生意。实际上，台资最集中的广东、福建两省基本上没受什么影响，台湾客商的经贸活动仍然十分活跃。
    安民透露说，６月４日后，某些大型台商投资项目仍在积极洽谈，两岸企业界大型的经贸洽谈活动也在积极酝酿之中。他对这些目光远大的台湾企业家表示敬意，相信在两岸同胞的共同努力下，两岸经贸往来和合作能够更快发展。
