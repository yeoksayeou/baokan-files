Courageous in Inheritance, Courageous in Development
– An Interview with Sun Daolin
Zhāng Shìhóng

Not long after the "Sun Daolin's 40-year Film Career" event concluded, I visited the artist's home. On the table lay the awards given by the Wenhui Daily and other units for the "Film and Television Elite Award," a bronze-like ancient ding.

When I congratulated him, he smiled slightly and said, "My films have won awards, but this is the first time I have received a personal award. This is a great encouragement for me, but the pressure is also great. Can I elevate my creative work? There are many difficulties."

Sun Daolin has acted in more than 20 films. As his old comrade Liu Jun said at the award ceremony, although he has not acted in many films, each one is a masterpiece. The artistic images of Xiao Jieqiu, Li Lianchang, Li Xia, Gao Juexin, and Zhang Bokun have left a deep impression on the audience. He acted in plays early on, so if this period is included, his artistic career spans 50 years. His talents are multifaceted, with achievements in drama performance, recitation, novel translation, poetry creation, and film performance theory. In recent years, he has also self-written, directed, and acted in "Thunderstorm" and "The Extraordinary President."

"Over the past 40 years, the road that Chinese cinema has traveled is tortuous," he calmly reflected on the past. "In the 17 years after the founding of the nation, I made the most films, and these films are still passable. I think the main reason is that they are rooted in the masses."

When discussing the inheritance of the realistic tradition, he said, "The concept of realism should be broadened a bit and not confined to old notions. Since the reforms and opening up, colleagues have made many exploratory films, which are worth noting. No matter how 'subjective' a film is, it is an objective existence to the audience. Realism should not be understood too narrowly; otherwise, there will be no progress. In practice, I feel that for a film to break through, one must work very hard. This is also a difficult problem I face now."

"You mentioned that commercial films are rampant now, and there are many discussions about this. What is your view?" I asked.

"This is an inevitable process. In the past, films overly emphasized their educational function, deviating from the laws of film art. Now, films are in a stage of recovery and have achieved results. Entertainment films are needed. In fact, the term 'entertainment film' is not quite accurate. All films have entertainment value; different levels of people have different requirements. Good entertainment films also have artistic value and educational significance. The problem lies in the level of taste. Some current entertainment films are of poor quality. How to improve the quality of creators and explore new paths is a problem that needs to be addressed. At the same time, efforts should be made to improve the audience's artistic appreciation, rather than catering to them."

In recent years, a large number of young actors have emerged, and this is the hope of Chinese cinema. I hope he can give some advice to young actors.

He said, "Many young actors are very talented. There is a debate: should actors mainly express themselves, or should they strive to create characters? I think an actor cannot always repeat himself or rely on the actor's personal charm. Creating various characters should be the direction of effort. A good actor should create various character images. For example, Shi Hui, the characters he created have breadth and depth, making people unforgettable. But he is still Shi Hui, not someone else. Jiang Wen can act in 'Hibiscus Town' and also in 'Red Sorghum.' I think this is a success. If every role is the same, it becomes monotonous. Of course, directors have a great influence on actors, but I always hope that actors can be good at creating and not become tools for others to manipulate."

Currently, the Shanghai Film Studio is preparing to shoot our country's classic "Romance of the Three Kingdoms," divided into 10 episodes, directed by the old director Xu Sangchao. Sun Daolin is preparing to direct the first episode, "The Chaos of Dong Zhuo," and is also writing the script for the tenth episode, "The Fall of Shu." He said he is studying the political philosophy of the Han and Jin periods, familiarizing himself with the characters' state of mind. In the later period of the Three Kingdoms, Zhong Hui and Jiang Wei were both very learned men. Zhong Hui even wrote "The Treatise on the Tao," not the face in Peking opera.

Sun Daolin is still relentlessly seeking. His artistic vitality is still very strong. Indeed, artists with a strong sense of responsibility will not grow old.

　　勇于继承　勇于发展
    ——访孙道临
    章世鸿
    “孙道临电影生涯４０年”活动结束后不久，我到艺术家府上访问。桌面上放着举办这次活动的文汇报等单位发给的“影视精英奖”的奖品，一个仿青铜古鼎。
    我向他祝贺时，他微微一笑说：“我的电影得过奖，但我个人得奖还是第一次。这对我是很大的鼓励，但压力也很大，我能否把创作抓上去，困难很多。”
    孙道临拍了２０多部影片，正如他的老战友刘琼在颁奖仪式上所说，他拍的影片虽不多，但都是精品，肖涧秋、李连长、李侠、高觉新、张伯韩一系列艺术形象给观众留下很深印象。他早期演过话剧，如把这段加上去，他的艺术生涯就有５０年了。他的才华是多方面的，在话剧表演、朗诵、小说翻译、诗文创作和电影表演理论上都有一定成就，近年来还自编自导自演了《雷雨》和《非常大总统》。
    “４０年来，中国电影走过的道路是曲折的”，他平静地回顾过去，“建国后１７年，我拍的电影最多，这些影片还过得去，我想主要是它扎根于群众。”
    谈到继承现实主义传统时，他说：“现实主义这个概念应该扩大一点，不要停留在老观念上。改革、开放以来，同行们拍了许多探索性影片，值得重视。电影不论怎样‘主观’，对观众来说，它也是客观存在。不能把现实主义理解得太狭隘，否则不能进步。我在实践中感到，电影要有所突破，需下大功夫。这也是我现在面临的一个难题。”
    “现在商业化电影泛滥，有不少议论，你怎样看？”我说。
    “这是一个难以避免的过程。过去的电影过份强调教育功能，背离电影艺术的规律。现在电影处于复苏阶段，取得了成就。娱乐片是需要的，其实‘娱乐片’的名词也不大确切。任何电影都具有娱乐性，不同层次的人有不同要求。好的娱乐片也有艺术性，也有教育意义，问题在于格调高低。现在有些娱乐片质量差。如何提高创作人员的素质，需要探索新路子，同时要设法提高观众的艺术欣赏力，而不是去迎合。”
    这几年，涌现了大批年青演员，这是中国电影的希望所在。我希望他对青年演员提些要求。
    他说：“不少青年演员很有才华。现在有一种争论：演员主要表现自己，还是努力塑造人物？我想，一个演员，总不能老重复自己，或者老依靠演员个人的魅力。塑造各种人物，应该是努力方向。好的演员应该塑造各种人物形象。如石挥，他塑造的人物有广度，也有深度，使人难以忘怀。但他又是石挥，而不是别人。姜文能演《芙蓉镇》，又能演《红高粱》，我以为是成功的。什么戏都一个面孔，就单调了。当然，导演对演员影响很大，但我总希望演员要善于创造，不能成为任人摆布的工具。”
    现在，上影厂正在筹拍我国古典名著《三国演义》，共分１０集，由老厂长徐桑超主持。孙道临准备导演第一集《董卓之乱》，同时写第十集《蜀国灭亡》的剧本。他说，他正在研究汉晋时期人物的政治哲学思想，熟悉人物的思想状态。三国后期钟会、姜维都是很有学问的人，钟会还写过《道论》，不是京剧舞台上的那副脸谱。
    孙道临仍在不绝地求索。他的艺术生命力依然十分壮旺。确实，具有强烈责任感的艺术家是不会衰老的。
