There are still over 1,200 days until the 500th anniversary of Columbus's "discovery" of the American continent (October 12, 1992), but various commemorative activities have already begun in full swing on both sides of the Atlantic.

For centuries, historical monographs and textbooks have consistently recounted that it was Columbus who first "discovered" the American continent. In recent years, this assertion has faced challenges. In June 1984, at a meeting in Santo Domingo attended by representatives of the 500th Anniversary Commemoration Committee of Latin American countries and Spain and Portugal, the Mexican representative first proposed the theory of the "meeting of two continents." This theory pointed out that the phrase "Columbus discovered the American continent" is not entirely accurate, as before Columbus's arrival, the American continent from north to south was already inhabited by indigenous peoples who had created cultures of significant historical importance. Columbus's expedition in 1492 marked the beginning of a great historical process where peoples from previously isolated hemispheres began to approach and meet each other. From then on, the different cultures of Europe and the Americas began to exchange and promote each other. The phrase "the meeting of two continents" is closer to historical fact, as it places Europeans and American Indians on an equal footing, facilitating friendly cooperation and the development of relations between the peoples of the two continents. After this theory was proposed, it received the support and endorsement of many Latin American countries. In December of the same year, the Organization of American States, at a special meeting in Santo Domingo, unanimously adopted Mexico's proposal. In 1987, Spanish King Carlos, in a proclamation about the commemorative activities, also used the term "meeting." Last November, the Executive Board of UNESCO adopted Mexico's proposal, unanimously acknowledging that "the arrival of the Spanish fleet in the New World in 1492 constituted the meeting of two continents, not a discovery. Therefore, the activities held for the 500th anniversary of Columbus's arrival in the Americas should be 'commemorative' activities, not 'celebratory' activities." Since then, "the meeting of two continents" has become the theme and tone of the commemorative activities.

As early as the 1980s, Spain first proposed the idea of commemorating the 500th anniversary of Columbus's "discovery" of the American continent, aiming to establish a modern and democratic image of Spain in the contemporary international environment and to strengthen Spain's comprehensive exchanges and cooperation with Latin American countries. On April 10, 1981, King Carlos signed a decree establishing a national committee to be responsible for the commemorative activities. Spain's initiative was immediately met with enthusiastic responses, and the vast majority of Latin American countries established national committees to commemorate the "meeting of two continents." Since 1983, the national committees have held annual meetings to discuss matters related to the 500th anniversary commemorative activities. Since then, various activities have been frequently held, such as organizing exhibitions of Indian culture, historical issue discussions, international art festivals, scientific expeditions, restoration of related relics, personnel exchanges, filming of movies and television series, publishing books, and building replicas of the sailing ships used by Columbus, among others. It is estimated that Spain alone will have 500 such activities, costing 100 billion pesetas (1 dollar equals 110 pesetas).

The maritime commemorative activity named "Adventure-92" along the route of Columbus's "discovery" of the American continent has attracted over 2,000 young people from more than 20 countries in Spain and Latin America. Starting in 1985, they will sail five times, with an estimated cost of $9 million. The organizers hope that the young people, while following in the footsteps of the great explorer, will experience the importance of the "meeting of two continents" for history and the future. The 500th Anniversary Commemoration Committee in Japan decided to spend tens of millions of dollars to build a replica of Columbus's flagship, the "Santa Maria." This wooden sailboat without an engine is scheduled to depart from Palos in Spain in early 1992 and sail across the ocean to Japan in August of the same year, "realizing" Columbus's dream of finding the "Golden Country."

To coincide with the 500th anniversary commemorative activities, Spain decided to hold a large-scale international exposition in the ancient city of Seville, which has a history of 2,000 years, from April 12 to October 12, 1992. For 500 years, Seville has been the gateway for Europe to the Americas. The city's Columbus Library houses a rare manuscript on vellum with illustrations of the navigator and Columbus's own manuscripts, and Columbus's remains rest in the Carthusian Monastery there. The exposition will cover 215 hectares and is expected to attract about 60 countries. The European Economic Community, as a whole, will showcase Europe's achievements and future technological plans in the fields of science and culture. By the beginning of 1987, the main construction of the exposition had begun, and it is estimated that the number of visitors will reach 20 million. In addition, the 25th Olympic Games to be held in Barcelona in 1992 will undoubtedly add splendor to the 500th anniversary commemorative activities.

Looking back on history is for the future. As the honorary chairman of Spain's 500th Anniversary Commemoration Council, King Carlos said in his proclamation, "The upcoming grand celebration is not only about looking back at the past, but also about using the spirit of striving for great causes, inspired by nostalgia, to look forward to the future." The grand commemorative activities for the 500th anniversary of the meeting of the European and American continents will be recorded in history as "one of the most important events of the contemporary era."

　　两洲相遇五百年    
    ——哥伦布到达美洲五百周年纪念活动
    管彦忠
    距哥伦布“发现”美洲大陆５００周年（１９９２年１０月１２日）还有１２００多个日夜，但各式各样的纪念活动已在大西洋两岸紧锣密鼓地展开。
    几百年来，一部部历史专著和教科书总是重述：是哥伦布首先“发现”了美洲大陆。近年来，这一论断遇到了挑战。１９８４年６月，在圣多明各召开的拉美国家和西班牙、葡萄牙５００周年纪念委员会代表参加的会议上，墨西哥代表首次提出了“两个大陆相遇”的理论，指出哥伦布“发现”美洲大陆的提法并不确切，因为在哥伦布到达美洲之前，美洲从南到北早已有印第安人繁衍生息，他们创造的文化在世界历史上有一定的地位和作用。１４９２年哥伦布的远征意味着从前相互隔绝的两个半球上的人民彼此接近和相遇这一伟大历史过程的开始，从此欧美两个大陆不同的文化相互交流，彼此促进。“两个大陆相遇”的提法更接近于历史事实，它把欧洲人和美洲印第安人摆到平等的地位，有利于两个大陆人民的友好合作和国家关系的发展。这一理论提出后，得到了许多拉美国家的赞同和支持，同年１２月美洲国家组织在圣多明各召开的特别会议一致通过了墨西哥的主张。西班牙国王卡洛斯１９８７年在关于纪念活动的文告中也使用了“相遇”的提法。去年１１月联合国教科文组织执行委员会通过了墨西哥的提议，一致承认“１４９２年西班牙船队到达新大陆构成了两个大陆相遇，而不是发现。由此哥伦布到达美洲５００周年所举行的活动应为‘纪念’活动，而不是‘庆祝’活动”。此后，“两个大陆相遇”成为纪念活动的基调和主题。
    早在８０年代初，西班牙首先提出了纪念哥伦布“发现”美洲大陆５００周年活动的设想，目的是要在当代国际环境中树立现代化和民主的西班牙的新形象，加强西班牙与拉美国家的全面交流与合作。１９８１年４月１０日，卡洛斯国王签署法令成立了全国委员会来负责纪念活动。西班牙的倡议立即得到热烈响应，绝大多数拉美国家都成立了纪念“两个大陆相遇”的全国委员会。从１９８３年起各国委员会每年举行会议，商讨５００周年纪念活动事宜。此后各项活动频繁举行，如举办印第安文化展览会、历史问题讨论会、国际艺术节、进行科学考察、修复有关文物、人员互访、拍摄电影和电视系列片、出版图书、仿造哥伦布航行使用的帆船等等，总计活动项目仅西班牙将达５００个，耗资１万亿比塞塔（１美元等于１１０比塞塔）。
    沿着哥伦布“发现”美洲大陆的航线取名为“冒险—９２”的航海纪念活动，更吸引着来自西班牙和拉美２０多个国家的２０００名青年人，从１９８５年开始将航行５次，预计费用９００万美元。主办者希望青年们追寻伟大探险者的足迹时，体验“两个大陆相遇”对于历史和未来的重要意义。远在东方的日本纪念５００周年委员会决定花费上千万美元，仿造哥伦布的旗舰“圣马丽亚”号。这艘不装马达的木结构帆船预计１９９２年初从西班牙的帕洛斯角出发，飘洋过海于同年８月驶抵日本，“实现”当年哥伦布寻找“黄金国”的梦想。
    为配合５００周年纪念活动，西班牙决定１９９２年４月１２日至１０月１２日在有２０００年历史的古城塞维利亚举办大型国际博览会。５００年来，塞维利亚是欧洲联系美洲的门户，城里的哥伦布图书馆珍藏着印有航海家画像插图的牛皮纸孤本和哥伦布手稿，哥伦布的遗体就安息在那里的卡尔图哈修道院。博览会占地２１５公顷，预计约６０个国家参加。欧洲经济共同体作为一个整体，将在博览会上展示欧洲在科学文化方面的成就和未来的技术规划。１９８７年初博览会主体工程已破土动工，估计届时参观者将达２０００万人次。此外，１９９２年在巴塞罗那举办的第２５届奥运会无疑将为５００周年纪念活动增添异彩。
    回首历史是为了将来。卡洛斯国王作为西班牙纪念５００周年最高理事会名誉主席，他在《西班牙和美洲：相遇和手足之情》的文告中说，“日益临近的盛大庆典不仅限于回首往事，而且应该用怀古激发出来的为伟大事业奋发进取的精神展望未来”。隆重纪念欧美大陆相遇５００周年的活动，将以“当代最重要的事件之一”而载入史册。
