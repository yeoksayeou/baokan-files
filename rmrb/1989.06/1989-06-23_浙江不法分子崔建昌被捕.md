Criminal Cui Jianchang from Zhejiang Arrested

Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, June 23rd: The criminal Cui Jianchang, who tore down part of the national flag on the flagpole in front of the Zhejiang Provincial Government building, creating the incident of "Zhejiang Provincial Government lowering the flag to half-mast in mourning for the deceased students in Beijing," was arrested by the Nanchang Public Security Bureau on June 20th.

Cui Jianchang, 26 years old, is a student in the Industrial Art Department of Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts, class of 1985. On the morning of June 5th, around 11:00 AM, some students from Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts gathered in front of the Zhejiang Provincial Government building, causing a disturbance and demanding that the provincial government lower the flag to half-mast in mourning for the so-called deceased students in Beijing. Ignoring the warnings from the provincial government staff, Cui Jianchang climbed up to the flagpole and untied the rope securing the flag. When he couldn't pull the flag down immediately, he shook the flagpole violently, causing the national flag to be torn and hanging crookedly on the flagpole. The next day, student Zhang Weiping from Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts spread the lie that the Zhejiang Provincial Government had lowered the flag to half-mast in mourning for the deceased students in Beijing, which was then broadcast by "Voice of America," causing a very bad influence.

Cui Jianchang returned to Nanchang on June 10th. The Nanchang Public Security Bureau, based on the report from the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau, apprehended Cui Jianchang. Cui Jianchang admitted his crimes without hesitation.

　　浙江不法分子崔建昌被捕
    新华社南昌六月二十三日电  把浙江省政府门前旗杆上的国旗摇下一截，制造“浙江省政府为北京死难学生下半旗志哀”事件的不法分子崔建昌，六月二十日被南昌市公安机关抓获。
    崔建昌，现年二十六岁，是浙江美术学院八五级工艺美术系学生。六月五日上午十一时许，浙江美术学院一些学生游行来到浙江省政府前大门起哄，要省政府在门前下半旗，为所谓的北京死难学生志哀。崔建昌不顾省政府工作人员的劝阻，爬上门楼旗杆旁，解开系旗的绳索。旗一时拉不下来，他又猛摇旗杆，硬把国旗摇下一截，使之斜歪在旗杆上。次日，浙江美术学院学生、不法分子张伟平制造浙江省政府下半旗为北京死难学生志哀的谎言，通过电话传给“美国之音”记者。当天，“美国之音”就播出了这一谎言，造成极坏影响。
    崔建昌于六月十日潜回南昌市。南昌市公安机关根据杭州市公安局的通报，将崔建昌缉拿归案。崔建昌对自己的罪行供认不讳。
