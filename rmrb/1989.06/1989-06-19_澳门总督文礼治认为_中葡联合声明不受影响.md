Macao Governor Vitorino Cunha Ribeiro believes the Sino-Portuguese Joint Declaration will not be affected by the situation in China. According to a report by the _Macao Daily News_ yesterday, citing a Portuguese News Agency dispatch, Ribeiro pointed out that the Joint Declaration is binding on both countries. Regardless of what happens in China or Portugal, the Joint Declaration remains a document binding on nations rather than individuals.

The report said Ribeiro left Macao on June 16 to return to his home country for a report on his duties, and made the above remarks upon his arrival in Lisbon on June 17. He emphasized that there is no reason to doubt whether the agreement will be implemented.

　　澳门总督文礼治认为
    中葡联合声明不受影响
    新华社澳门６月１９日电  据《澳门日报》昨天援引葡新社消息报道：澳门总督文礼治指出，中葡联合声明不会受到中国局势的影响，因为联合声明对两个国家具有约束力，不管中国或葡国发生什么情况，联合声明始终是对国家而非对个人具有约束力的文件。
    据报道，文礼治于１６日离开澳门回国述职，１７日抵达里斯本时发表上述谈话。他强调说，没有任何理由怀疑协议是否会得到执行。
