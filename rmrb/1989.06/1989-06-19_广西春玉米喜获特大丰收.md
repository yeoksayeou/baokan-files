Guangxi, an important spring corn production area in southern China, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. Through the efforts of farmers from various ethnic groups, the region's 60 million mu (approximately 4 million hectares) of spring corn has yielded over 800 million kilograms, an increase of over 300 million kilograms compared to the same period last year.

Guangxi seized the optimal planting season for spring corn this year, with 60% to 70% of the spring corn planted during the best planting period from late January to February.
