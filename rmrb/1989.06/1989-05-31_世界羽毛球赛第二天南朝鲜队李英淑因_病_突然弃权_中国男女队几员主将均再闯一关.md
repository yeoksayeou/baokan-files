The second day of the sixth World Badminton Championships saw South Korean player Lee Young-Sook withdraw due to "illness," while several Chinese men's and women's team main players advanced to the next round.

Newspaper reporters Liang Jinxiong and Zhou Zongxin reported from Jakarta on May 30: On the second day of the tournament, female singles seed player and South Korean star Lee Young-Sook withdrew from the competition due to illness. Three seed players were eliminated.

Lee Young-Sook, who had a bye on the first day, suddenly announced her withdrawal from the competition today, drawing the attention of spectators and reporters. When interviewed by our reporter, Lee Young-Sook's coach said she had been too tired and felt unwell, hence her withdrawal. However, some eyewitnesses said that Lee Young-Sook had been slapped by her coach during the Sudirman Cup final, which had affected her mentally and made it impossible for her to compete normally. The reporter observed that Lee Young-Sook sat silently at breakfast this morning, waiting for her teammates to serve her food. At noon, "big brother" Kim Moon-soo led her by the hand into the bank.

Lee Young-Sook was slapped because, during the final, after winning the first set and leading 10-7 in the second set, she was unexpectedly defeated 2-1 by Indonesian youngster Rukmini. This cost South Korea a valuable point.

In today's second round of men's and women's singles and the first round of women's doubles and mixed doubles, three seed players were eliminated. They included China's Wu Wenkai, England's Smith, and South Korea's Bang Joo-hyun. Wu Wenkai, in his match against South Korea's 17-year-old youngster Kim Hak-kyun, was too eager to win, resulting in more mistakes and a 1-2 loss. The set scores were 15-6, 12-15, and 10-15.

China's Yang Yang, Zhao Jianhua, Xiong Guobao, and Zhang Qingwu all won 2-0 against their opponents and advanced to the third round of the men's singles. China's female players Li Lingwei, Han Aiping, Tang Jiuhong, Shi Xiaohui, and Shang Fumei all eliminated their opponents 2-0 and advanced to the third round. Huang Hua advanced to the third round without a fight due to her opponent's withdrawal.

Today, 16 mixed doubles seed pairs and 8 women's doubles seed pairs all had byes, with China having 3 pairs in each category. They will directly enter the second round tomorrow.

　　世界羽毛球赛第二天南朝鲜队李英淑因“病”突然弃权
    中国男女队几员主将均再闯一关
    新华社雅加达５月３０日电  （记者梁金雄、周宗欣）第六届世界羽毛球锦标赛今天进入第二天，女单种子选手、南朝鲜名将李英淑因“病”退出比赛，３名种子选手被淘汰。
    昨天轮空的李英淑今天突然宣布退出比赛，这一新闻引起观众，特别是记者的关注。李英淑的教练在接受本社记者采访时说，李英淑这几天太累了，身体感到不适，故退出比赛。而据一些目击者说，李英淑在苏迪曼杯决赛中，遭其教练一记耳光，精神受到刺激，无法正常参赛。记者看到，李英淑今早用餐时只呆呆坐着，等队友们供食。中午，“老大哥”金文秀牵着她的手步入银行。
    李英淑挨耳光，是因为她参加决赛时，在先胜一局，第二局又以１０∶７领先的情况下，反被印度尼西亚小将王莲香以２∶１取胜，使南朝鲜失去宝贵的一分。
    在今天男、女单打第二轮比赛和女双、混双第一轮角逐中，３名种子选手被拉下马。他们中男选手是中国的吴文凯，女选手是英格兰的史密斯和南朝鲜的方铢贤。吴文凯在与南朝鲜的１７岁小将金学均比赛时，求胜心切，致使失误增多，以１∶２失利，３局的比分为１５∶６，１２∶１５，１０∶１５。
    中国的杨阳、赵剑华、熊国宝和张青武均以２∶０战胜对手，进入男单第三轮比赛。中国女选手李玲蔚、韩爱平、唐九红、史晓惠和尚幅梅均以２∶０淘汰对手，闯入第三轮比赛。黄华因对手弃权不战自胜进入第三轮比赛。
    １６对混双种子选手和８对女双种子选手在今天的比赛中均轮空，其中中国各有３对选手，明天直接进入第二轮比赛。
