	Martial Arts in South Yang Han Paintings
	Dou Yue-sheng

	In the Han paintings stored and displayed at the South Yang Han Painting Museum in Henan Province, there are many scenes depicting sports activities. Among these, martial arts stand out prominently.

	This indicates that martial arts were already popular and highly regarded by the people of South Yang during the Han Dynasty, and had reached a considerable level of proficiency.

	In the South Yang Han paintings, there are scenes of boxing, striking with open hands, and hooking with hands. There are scenes of hunting and shooting tigers. There are scenes of riding horses and practicing archery. There are scenes of unarmed warriors fighting against monsters. There are scenes of warriors wielding long spears, wearing masks, or engaging in bullfighting without any weapons. The most representative of these can be said to be the "Boxing Heroes" (see attached image).

	This block of Han painting stone, which depicts a scene of practicing boxing and fighting, is 44 centimeters wide and 136 centimeters long, and was discovered in South Yang County. The image shows three heroes engaged in unarmed combat. The person in the middle is in a bow stance, punching towards the enemies on both sides, creating a one-against-two free-fighting situation. The person on the left is in a jumping, fierce, and forward-moving posture, with one hand in a fist and the other hand open, stepping forward to attack. The person on the right is in a bow stance, defending and protecting himself, also using both fists and open hands (the actions of the three people's hands in the image are shown in two sets, including fist, open hand, and hooking hand movements). The scene is concise and vivid, the figures are lifelike, and the martial arts movements are strong and powerful, giving a lively and realistic feeling of performing, competing, and actually fighting in martial arts.

	From another perspective, the martial arts in the South Yang Han paintings not only show postures and scenes but also help us understand the attire of the practitioners (such as sportswear) and the physical beauty of the human body at that time. The clothing was loose-sleeved, baggy pants, half-length shirts, and tightly tied belts; the body shapes were all standard "inverted triangle" male physiques.

	Martial arts have influenced ancient Chinese acrobatics, dance, wrestling, and literature. In the South Yang Han paintings, there are also contents related to martial arts, wrestling, acrobatics, and dance.

### 南阳汉画中的武术

　　南阳汉画中的武术
    窦跃生
    在河南省南阳汉画馆珍藏陈列的汉画像石中，可以看到很多描述体育活动的画面。而尤为突出的当属武术。
    这表明武术早在汉代就已经受到南阳人民的喜爱和重视，并已达到相当的水平。
    在南阳汉画中，有打拳亮掌勾手的画面，有田猎射虎的画面，有骑马引弓对练射术的画面，有赤手空拳的武士与怪兽相斗的场面，有手执长矛、头戴面具或徒手斗牛角技的画面等等。最具有代表性的可以说是《拳勇图》（见附图）。
    这一块刻有练拳对打场景的汉画像石宽４４厘米，长１３６厘米，发现于南阳县。图中表现的是：在山峦与云气之间，三勇士正在进行徒手搏击格斗。位居中间的一人弓步出拳迎战左右敌手，为一对二的散打局势。左边一人作跳跃奋勇向前状，他一手握拳，一手亮掌跨步进击；而右边一人则呈弓步防守自卫的姿式，亦拳掌并用（图中三人手的动作均为两套，有拳、掌、勾手的动作）。画面简洁精练，人物形象栩栩如生，武术动作刚健有力，进行武术表演、比赛和实打的整体感觉生动逼真。
    从另外一个角度看，南阳汉画中的武术，不仅表现出姿态、场景，还可以帮助我们了解当时习武者的装束（即运动衣之类）和人体的健美情况。服装是敞袖、肥裤、半长衫、紧束腰带等；体形均为标准的“倒三角”男子健美体魄。
    武术影响到中国古代的杂技、舞蹈、角抵百戏和文学等。在南阳汉画中，也有武术和角抵百戏、杂技、舞蹈等方面的内容。
