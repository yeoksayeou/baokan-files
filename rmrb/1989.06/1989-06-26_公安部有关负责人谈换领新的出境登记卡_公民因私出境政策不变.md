Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 26th.

A reporter recently visited the relevant authorities at the Public Security Bureau's Exit-Entry Administration Bureau regarding the need for Chinese citizens to obtain new exit-entry permits for private travel abroad.

The official stated that to strengthen the management of private travel abroad in accordance with the law, the Public Security Bureau recently issued a notice. All individuals holding exit-entry permits issued before June 20 must obtain new permits to enter foreign embassies and consulates in China to apply for visas and exit the country.

The public security organs' exit-entry administration departments issue exit-entry permits to domestic citizens at the same time as they approve the issuance of passports, in accordance with Article 6 of the "Implementation Regulations of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Control of Exit and Entry of Citizens." This is one of the administrative measures the state takes to manage citizens' exits. To ensure that applicants with complete procedures and documentation can exit the country as soon as possible, local public security bureaus have increased the number of staff handling permit exchanges, worked overtime, and expedited the process for those who have already purchased international flight or train tickets, providing convenience.

According to statistics from Beijing, Shanghai, Guangdong, Fujian, and Zhejiang, from June 20 to 24, 8,523 new exit-entry permits were issued. Most of these individuals exchanged their permits to apply for visas at foreign embassies and consulates, while many others did so to purchase international flight or train tickets. Additionally, some had already completed the necessary procedures and were preparing to exit the country or had already done so.

Regarding the issue of overseas Chinese returning to China and then exiting again, the official stated that according to Article 8 of the "Implementation Regulations of the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Control of Exit and Entry of Citizens," overseas Chinese returning to China and then exiting again only need to present a valid People's Republic of China passport or a valid People's Republic of China travel document or other valid exit documents. In other words, overseas Chinese can exit the country with a valid passport, document, and residence permit or visa from their country of residence.

Self-funded students temporarily returning to China to visit family or take a vacation and then exiting again to continue their studies need to obtain an exit-entry permit, which is the original regulation.

The official concluded by stating that the policy for Chinese citizens' private exit and entry will not change. We will continue to improve the system, increase transparency, and legally protect the lawful rights of citizens for private exit and entry. He hopes that domestic citizens applying for private exit, overseas Chinese, and self-funded students abroad will not believe in rumors.

　　公安部有关负责人谈换领新的出境登记卡    
    公民因私出境政策不变
    本报北京６月２６日讯  记者日前就我国公民因私出国需要更换新的出境登记卡事，走访了公安部出入境管理局负责人。
    这位负责人说，为依法加强因私出境的管理工作，公安部最近发出通知，凡持有６月２０日以前签发的出境登记卡者，需要换领新的出境登记卡，方能进入外国驻华使、领馆办理签证和出境。
    公安机关出入境管理部门在批准国内公民出境签发护照的同时附发出境登记卡，是根据《中华人民共和国公民出境入境管理法实施细则》第六条的规定办理的，这是国家对公民出境实施行政管理的措施之一。为使手续完备、证明齐全的申请人能够尽快顺利出境，各地公安机关增加了办理换卡人员，加班加点，为已购妥机票等人员急办快办，给予方便。
    据北京、上海、广东、福建、浙江等五省市统计，从６月２０日到２４日，为申请人换领新出境登记卡８５２３张。其中多数人换卡是为了到外国驻华使、领馆申办签证，也有不少人是为了购买国际机、车票，还有不少人已办妥有关手续准备出境或已经出境。
    关于定居国外的华侨回国后再出境是否换领新的出境登记卡问题，这位负责人说，根据《中华人民共和国公民出境入境管理法实施细则》第八条规定：定居国外的中国公民回国后出境，凭有效的中华人民共和国护照或者有效的中华人民共和国旅行证或者其他有效出境证件，无需换领新的出境登记卡。也就是说，华侨凭有效的护照、证件和侨居国居留证或居留签证即可出境。
    自费留学人员临时回国探亲、休假，再出境继续学习的，需要领取出境登记卡出境是原来既有的规定。
    这位负责人最后说，中国公民因私出入境的政策不会改变。我们还将继续完善制度，增加透明度，依法保障公民因私出入境的合法权益。他希望申请因私出境的国内公民和国外华侨以及在国外的自费留学人员，不要听信谣言。
