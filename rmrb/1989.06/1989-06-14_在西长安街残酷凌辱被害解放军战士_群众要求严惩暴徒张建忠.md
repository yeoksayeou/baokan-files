According to a report from the Beijing Municipal Public Security Bureau: Over the course of three days and nights, Beijing's public security organs have been working tirelessly and successfully apprehended the perpetrator Zhang Jianzhong at around 2:00 AM on June 12.

Zhang Jianzhong, male, 27 years old, resides in Beijing's Chongwen District. He was previously sentenced to re-education through labor for theft. After being released from re-education in 1985, he engaged in individual business operations. However, he did not repent and instead turned against the people, venting his dissatisfaction with the government and society. This year in May, he joined the "Citizen's Suicide Squad" and spent his days causing trouble in Tiananmen Square.

Upon interrogation, Zhang Jianzhong confessed that on the night of June 5, he went to West Chang'an Avenue. He saw the corpse of a PLA soldier hanging from a burned-out public bus in front of the Telegraph Building. He then found a piece of broken glass and brutally cut a 5-centimeter-long incision into the soldier's abdomen. He then used a plastic rope to tie up the exposed intestines. This brutal desecration of the soldier's body has sparked widespread outrage among the public, who are demanding severe punishment for the perpetrator.

　　在西长安街残酷凌辱被害解放军战士
    群众要求严惩暴徒张建忠
    据新华社北京６月１３日电  据北京市公安局提供的消息：北京市公安机关连续奋战三天三夜，于６月１２日凌晨二时许将残酷凌辱被害解放军战士的暴徒张建忠抓获。
    张建忠，男，２７岁，住北京市崇文区，曾因盗窃被劳动教养。１９８５年解除劳教后从事个体经营，但他不思悔改，与人民为敌，发泄对政府和社会的不满，在今年５月加入“市民敢死队”，整天活动在天安门广场，制造事端。
    经审讯，张建忠交待，他于６月５日零时许，窜到西长安街，见在电报大楼对面一辆被烧毁的公共汽车上吊着一具解放军战士的尸体，便找到一块碎玻璃片凶残地在尸体的肚子上割开一个长约５厘米的口子，然后用一根塑料绳将勾出来的一部分肠子系上。这种残酷凌辱被害解放军战士的行径，引起了广大群众的强烈愤慨。他们纷纷要求严惩暴徒。
