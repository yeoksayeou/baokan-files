Nicaraguan President Ortega proposed on June 24 that the next summit of the five Central American countries be held from July 28 to 30 in Honduras.

Costa Rican President Arias had announced on June 1 on behalf of the four Central American countries, excluding Nicaragua, that the summit would be held from July 7 to 9.

Nicaraguan President Ortega said at a meeting with small industrialists in Masaya that it would be inappropriate to hold the Central American summit on July 8, as the foreign ministers of the Central American countries would be attending the inauguration of the new Argentine president.

Ortega pointed out that the fifth summit of the Central American countries should discuss the issue of disbanding the Nicaraguan anti-government guerrilla forces stationed in Honduras. He also hoped that the Central American presidents would reach an agreement to demand that the U.S. government lift the trade embargo against Nicaragua.

The fourth summit of the five Central American countries was held in February this year in El Salvador.

　　尼加拉瓜总统建议    
    推迟召开中美洲首脑会议
    新华社马那瓜６月２４日电  尼加拉瓜总统奥尔特加２４日建议，７月２８日至３０日在洪都拉斯召开下一次中美洲５国首脑会议。
    哥斯达黎加总统阿里亚斯曾于６月１日代表除尼加拉瓜以外的中美洲４国总统宣布，７月７日至９日召开中美洲首脑会议。
    尼加拉瓜总统在马萨亚同小工业主举行的一次会议上说，鉴于７月８日阿根廷新总统就职，中美洲各国外长将前去参加仪式，那时召开中美洲国家首脑会议是不合适的。
    奥尔特加指出，中美洲国家第５次首脑会议应该讨论解散驻扎在洪都拉斯的尼加拉瓜反政府武装游击队问题。他还希望中美洲各国总统达成协议，要求美国政府取消对尼加拉瓜的贸易禁运。
    中美洲５国首脑第４次会议是今年２月在萨尔瓦多举行的。
