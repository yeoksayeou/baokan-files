Japanese Liberal Democratic Party Decides on Uno as New President

Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, May 31st. Reporter Yu Qing reports: The current Japanese Foreign Minister Uno Soichiro was finally confirmed by the Liberal Democratic Party today as the successor to Takeshita as the new president.

The acting secretary-general of the Liberal Democratic Party, Hashimoto Ryutaro, announced this decision to reporters at the party headquarters this evening. Hashimoto said he had contacted Uno, who is currently in Paris attending the OECD meeting. Uno responded, saying that although he lacked confidence in taking on the role at such a critical time, he would dedicate himself fully, given the party's greatest crisis since its founding, and accepted the party's decision.

Prime Minister Takeshita decided on May 24th to personally mediate the selection of a new president. Uno was proposed as a candidate on the 27th. In the days that followed, Takeshita traveled extensively, gathering opinions within the party. Former Prime Ministers Fukuda Takeo and Suzuki Zenko proposed the "separation of president and prime minister" and the "collective leadership system within the party," which were ultimately not accepted by the party's executive meeting. Fukuda and Suzuki expressed opposition to Uno's candidacy for the presidency.

Takeshita has instructed Uno in Paris to return to Japan immediately. It is expected that Uno will return to Tokyo this afternoon. On the 2nd, he will be formally elected as the 13th president of the Liberal Democratic Party at the party's parliamentary meeting. On the 2nd or 3rd, he will undergo a nomination election in the National Diet to confirm him as Japan's 75th and 47th government prime minister.

　　日自民党决定
    宇野继任总裁
    本报东京５月３１日电  记者于青报道：现任日本外相宇野宗佑今天最终被自民党确定为继任竹下的新总裁。
    日本自民党代理干事长桥本龙太郎今天傍晚在自民党本部向记者公布了这一决定。桥本说，他已同正在巴黎参加经合组织会议的宇野取得联系。宇野回答说，受命于非常时期，虽然缺少自信，但面临结党以来最大危机，将不惜献身，表示接受自民党的决定。
    竹下首相２４日决定亲自出面斡旋新总裁。宇野作为候选人是２７日突然提出的。几天来，竹下四处奔走，在党内听取意见。前任首相福田赳夫和铃木善幸提出“总裁、总理分离论”，“党内集体领导体制论”，最终没有被自民党干部会议接受。福田和铃木等对宇野出任总裁表示反对。
    竹下已指示在巴黎的宇野立即回国，预计宇野将在１日下午返回东京。２日，将在自民党国会议员大会上正式选出宇野担任自民党第１３任总裁。２日或３日，将在国会进行指名选举，确定宇野为日本内阁第７５任、第４７位政府首相。
