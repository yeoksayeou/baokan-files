In recent days, in the garrison city of Zhangjiakou, Hebei Province, where the People's Liberation Army's certain group army is stationed to carry out martial law in Beijing, a wave of supporting the military and caring for military families has surged.

To ensure that the troops can focus on carrying out martial law in Beijing, the Zhangjiakou Municipal Party Committee and Municipal Government issued a special notice. The city and various districts and counties have established temporary leading groups to specifically handle the organization and coordination of supporting the military and caring for military families. Various units and departments have designated a leader to be responsible for this work. At various levels, leaders have led teams to visit the garrison offices of the troops carrying out martial law and the homes of the soldiers, and have distributed letters of condolence to the soldiers and their families carrying out martial law. They have adopted a household service approach, visiting each household, and helping to solve practical difficulties. The public security departments have also organized forces to strengthen the security of the garrison camps and family areas.

The People's Liberation Army's certain group army, which went to Beijing to carry out martial law, learned about the situation of supporting the military and caring for military families in Zhangjiakou City, and specially wrote a letter to express their heartfelt thanks.

　　热情关心进京戒严部队
    张家口开展拥军活动
    本报张家口６月１６日电  近日来，在开赴北京执行戒严任务的解放军某集团军驻扎地河北省张家口市，掀起了拥军优属的热潮。
    为使部队安心在京执行戒严任务，张家口市委、市政府专门发出了通知。市里和各区、县分别成立了临时领导小组，具体负责拥军优属的组织、协调工作。各单位、各部门确定一名领导负责这项工作。各级领导带队，分别到执行戒严任务的各部队留守处及官兵家中慰问，并向执行戒严任务的官兵及家属印发了慰问信。他们采取包户服务的办法，逐户走访，帮助解决实际困难。公安部门还组织力量，加强驻军营房周围和家属区的安全保卫。
    赴京执行戒严任务的解放军某集团军得知张家口市拥军优属的情况后，特意写信表示衷心感谢。
