Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 1st.

The World Youth Football Championship is imminent. Our young players are in Europe for warm-up matches and are in good form.

The Chinese national youth football team, which is training in Europe, recently concluded its stay in West Germany and played two matches against local strong teams, achieving one win and one draw.

The Chinese youth team defeated the Wolfsburg youth team 2-1 in West Germany and drew 3-3 with the Lower Saxony youth team.

The Chinese youth team, sponsored and arranged by Coca-Cola China Limited, was invited by the West German and Dutch football associations to train and compete in Europe. This is a preparatory exercise for the team before representing Asia in the FIFA Under-16 World Championship to be held in Scotland in June.

After defeating the Dutch youth champions Ajax 1-0 in Amsterdam on May 21st, the Chinese youth team moved to Bassum, West Germany. Their first match was against the Lower Saxony youth team on May 23rd. In the 30-degree Celsius heat, the Chinese youth team conceded a goal shortly after the start. More than ten minutes later, the Chinese youngsters steadied their formation and began attacking the opponent's goal. Forward Li Ming scored the first goal. Soon after, Liu Zhong added another goal. At halftime, the Chinese team led 2-1.

In the second half, midfielder Jin Guangxu took advantage of an opponent's misplaced pass, intercepted the ball, and scored, making it 3-1. However, the Chinese team was affected by the high temperature, and the players' stamina waned, allowing the opponent to quickly counterattack and score two goals in the closing minutes.

Coach Zhu Guanghui said after the match that the Chinese team's defense was excellent, and their midfield control was also good. They should have scored more goals, but they relaxed in the final minutes, giving the opponent a chance to counterattack. He believes the Chinese team must improve their ability to maintain peak performance throughout the entire match. The Chinese youth team's second match in West Germany was against the Wolfsburg youth team on May 25th. The Wolfsburg youth team had taller players than the Chinese youngsters. However, the Chinese team was fearless and launched a massive offensive from the start. The defenders also performed exceptionally well, and goalkeeper Fu Bin repeatedly saved crucial shots, earning the audience's applause.

The newly joined Liu Zhong, with his speed, seized the opportunity to open the scoring. Just before halftime, Li Ming scored another goal, making it 2-0 for the Chinese team.

In the second half, the Chinese team's offensive did not wane, but the opponent strengthened their defense and counterattacked, scoring a goal. The Chinese team won 2-1.

So far, the Chinese youth team has achieved a record of 3 wins and 1 draw in their European training matches.

The Chinese youth team returned to the Netherlands on May 27th and will play three more matches there. On June 5th, they will leave the Netherlands for Scotland to participate in the biennial World Youth Football Championship.

　　世界少年足球大赛在即
    我小将赴欧热身状态良好
    新华社北京６月１日电  西德沃尔夫斯堡消息，赴欧洲集训的中国国家少年足球队近日结束西德之行，并在西德期间与当地两支强队比赛，取得１胜１平的战绩。
    中国少年队在西德以２∶１战胜沃尔夫斯堡少年队，与下萨克森郡少年队踢成３平。
    中国少年队是在可口可乐中国有限公司的赞助和安排下，应西德和荷兰足球协会邀请前往欧洲集训比赛的。这是该队代表亚洲参加今年６月在苏格兰举行的国际足联１６岁以下世界锦标赛前的一次适应性练兵。
    继５月２１日在阿姆斯特丹１∶０击败荷兰少年冠军阿贾克斯队后，中国少年队便移师西德巴辛豪森，首战于５月２３日与下萨克森郡少年队交锋。在３０摄氏度的高温下，中国少年队开赛不久即失一球。十多分钟后，中国小将才稳住阵脚，开始攻击对方球门，由前锋李明首先射入一球。随后刘忠为中国队再添一分。上半时结束时，中国队以２∶１领先。
    下半时比赛，中国队前卫金光洙利用对方传球失误，断球后攻入一球，打成３∶１的局面。但其后中国队受高温影响，队员体力不支，被对手伺机快速反击，在终场前射入两球。
    中国队教练朱广沪赛后表示，中国队防守较为出色，中场控制也不错，应该能多攻进几个球，可惜在终场前有些松懈，给对手造成反击机会。他认为，中国队必须加强在全场比赛中保持最佳状态的能力。中国少年队在西德的第二役于５月２５日在沃尔夫斯堡进行，对手沃尔夫斯堡少年队队员身材比中国小将高。但中国队队员毫不畏惧，开球后即大举进攻，后卫防守也相当出色，守门员符宾更是屡救险球，令对手多次攻门都无功而返，博得观众阵阵喝采。
    新近入队的刘忠速度快，把握时机首开纪录。上半时比赛结束前，李明攻门成功，使中国队２∶０领先。
    下半时比赛中国队攻势不减，但对手加强了防守并伺机反击扳回一球。中国队以２∶１取得最后胜利。
    至此，中国少年队在欧洲的集训比赛中取得了３战２胜１平的成绩。
    中国少年队已于５月２７日重返荷兰，并在荷兰再进行３场比赛。６月５日，他们将离荷兰赴苏格兰，参加两年一度的世界少年足球大赛。
