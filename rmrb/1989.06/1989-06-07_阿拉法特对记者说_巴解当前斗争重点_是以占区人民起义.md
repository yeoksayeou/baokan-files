Yesterday afternoon, during a press conference in Kuwait, the Palestinian national leader Arafat said that the PLO has not stopped armed struggle. He has not asked anyone to stop military actions, but the current focus of the struggle is on the uprising of the people in the occupied territories. He mentioned that he had faced tremendous pressure on the issue of using weapons against the Israeli occupiers, but in the end, the PLO leadership decided not to use weapons.

Arafat pointed out that Syria agrees with all the political initiatives proposed by the PLO at present. At the special Arab summit, President Assad abandoned his reservations and supported the Palestinian initiative.

Arafat said that on Thursday, the third round of US-Palestine talks will be held. The PLO is not in a weak position in the US-Palestine dialogue.

　　阿拉法特对记者说
    巴解当前斗争重点
    是以占区人民起义
    本报大马士革６月７日电  记者吕志星报道：昨天下午，正在科威特进行访问的巴勒斯坦国家元首阿拉法特在记者招待会上说，巴解没有停止武装斗争，他没有要求任何人停止军事行动，但当前的斗争重点是放在被占领土人民的起义上。他提到，在使用武器对付以色列占领者问题上，他曾遇到巨大压力，但最后在巴解领导会议上决定不使用武器。
    阿拉法特指出，叙利亚同意巴解组织目前所提出的一切政治倡议。在阿拉伯特别首脑会议上，阿萨德总统放弃了保留意见而赞同巴勒斯坦倡议。
    阿拉法特说，星期四美巴将举行第三次对话。巴解在美巴对话中不是处在弱者位置。
