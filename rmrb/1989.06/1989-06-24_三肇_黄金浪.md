The "Three Zhaos"—Zhaozhou, Zhaodong, and Zhaoyuan counties in Heilongjiang Province—were once known for their poverty. Over the past three years, their total grain production has increased by 10% to 20% annually. What brought about this change? Let's take a look.

The "Three Zhaos" refers to the three counties of Zhaozhou, Zhaodong, and Zhaoyuan in Heilongjiang Province. The crescent-shaped black soil belt on the Songnen Plain bypasses them, leaving the people of the "Three Zhaos" with barren land that is hard as iron in dry weather and impermeable after rain. Until the early 1980s, the grain yield per mu (approximately 0.067 hectares) was barely over 100 kilograms, and some impoverished villages still relied on relief grain.

However, in recent years, while many counties have been troubled by stagnant grain production, the "Three Zhaos" have achieved a continuous increase of 10% to 20% in grain production for three consecutive years. Last year, the total grain production reached 1.674 billion kilograms, an increase of 64.5% compared to the bumper harvest year of 1984. This production accounts for 1/10 of the total grain and soybean production in Heilongjiang Province, while their cultivated area is only 1/22 of the province's total. How did the "Three Zhaos," known for their barren land, achieve continuous increases in production? This phenomenon, praised by experts as the "Golden Wave of the Three Zhaos," provides what kind of inspiration for breaking through the stagnation in agriculture?

The "soft and hard" investment

Using the phrase "generous investment" to describe the "Three Zhaos'" investment in agriculture is not an exaggeration.

Firstly, there is the investment in fertilizers, with the amount applied per mu increasing by 5 to 7 times over a few years. Secondly, there is the investment in agricultural machinery. According to statistics from Zhaodong City, last year the city had 1,564 large and medium-sized agricultural tractors, an increase of 12.8% compared to before the household responsibility system. Thirdly, there is the construction of anti-drought and waterlogging projects. Zhaozhou County, which has no water sources, invested 5.1 million yuan from 1986 onwards to build 1,670 motorized wells and 400 kilometers of drainage and irrigation channels. In the spring of 1987, during a severe drought, nearly 1 million mu of corn was irrigated and planted in just 15 days. In the autumn of 1988, after a heavy rain of 184 millimeters, 400,000 mu of farmland was flooded, but 90% of the water was drained in just two days. In addition, there are large quantities of high-quality seeds, pesticides, and plastic film, among other inputs.

As the main investors, farmers are willing to invest because they have seen the effects of these inputs. In early 1984, a farmer from Fengle Town in Zhaozhou County brought back 10 kilograms of "four single eight" corn seeds from Jilin Province, turning the dream of 1,000 kilograms per mu into a reality. Later, a team of experts from the Heilongjiang Provincial Agricultural Science Academy and the county's Party Secretary, Ma Dianyou, conducted a high-yield corn experiment on 150 mu of land in seven households in Shuangfa Township, achieving an average yield of 600 kilograms per mu. The news spread, and a high-yield corn campaign covering 1 million mu quickly gained momentum.

"High investment must be scientific investment." During the interviews, I truly felt the importance of this approach. While they introduced new technologies such as high-quality seeds, deep plowing, reasonable planting density, soil testing for fertilizer application, and increased use of micro-fertilizers into the fields, they also emphasized the importance of bringing scientific awareness and methods into the minds of the farmers. For example, they invited experts and professors to give lectures, organized technical personnel to go to the countryside, established agricultural technology promotion schools, conducted practical technology training, and launched large-scale "Science Winter" activities for the masses, ensuring that "every household has someone who understands scientific farming." It is the combination of science and investment that has opened the door to high agricultural yields.

The "central axis strategy" of promoting agriculture through animal husbandry

This strategy has different specific implementations in the "Three Zhaos," but the overall intent is the same. Because the "Three Zhaos" have vast grasslands, and with the bumper harvest of grain and abundant feed, the animal husbandry industry has developed rapidly in recent years, with the breeding of sheep, cattle, chickens, and geese ranking at the top in the province. The development of animal husbandry has provided a large amount of high-quality organic fertilizer for agriculture. The average amount of organic fertilizer applied per mu has increased from 1,000 kilograms in the past to 2,500-3,000 kilograms. According to surveys, last year, the organic matter content in about 60% of the fields in the "Three Zhaos" increased by 0.3‰ to 0.6‰ compared to 1984.

In Li Qin's household in Dechang Township, Zhaodong City, I heard an interesting story. His 19 mu of land had an average yield of 735 kilograms per mu. The amount of chemical fertilizer applied per mu was less than 30 standard units, mainly relying on manure for fertilization. Last spring, he lent a piece of land to Zhang Lichang to grow sugar beets, and in the autumn, each sugar beet head weighed an average of 1 kilogram, with a yield twice as high as that of ordinary fields. Inspired by Li Qin, many farmers nearby also adopted the strategy of promoting agriculture through animal husbandry. Last year, Dechang Township had an average of 0.8 cattle, 4 sheep, and 3.6 pigs per household.

The implementation of the strategy of promoting agriculture through animal husbandry was driven by price leverage. From 1985 to 1988, the price increase for three major agricultural production materials (fertilizer, diesel, and pesticides) was 75.3%, while the price increase for three major livestock products (pork, fresh eggs, and wool) was 103%. For farmers engaged in both agriculture and animal husbandry, the latter increase offset the former, ensuring investment in grain production.

The "micro-adjustment" of industrial and agricultural interests

In the context of a deteriorating macro environment, how can agricultural counties protect farmers' enthusiasm for developing commodity production and their willingness to invest in land? This is indeed a headache. The "Three Zhaos" have done their best to adopt "micro-adjustment" measures, achieving good results.

Government investment in agriculture is maintained at 8%-12% of the total fiscal expenditure each year, used for agricultural water conservancy, large and medium-sized agricultural machinery matching, agricultural technology promotion, and partial price subsidies for industrial raw materials.

Encouraging urban support for rural areas. Mobilizing and organizing processing enterprises and commercial enterprises that use agricultural and sideline products as raw materials to start from vigorously supporting the production of the "first workshop," providing loans with interest subsidies for farmers, and supplying fertilizers, pesticides, and plastic film at preferential prices. During the two years of 1986 to 1987 when the sugar industry was not prosperous, they used this method to protect farmers' enthusiasm for growing sugar beets. Factories also maintained profits due to sufficient raw materials; financial and tax departments increased income by first giving and then taking back.

Establishing and improving various types of rural socialized service systems.

### “三肇”黄金浪

    黑龙江省的肇东、肇州、肇源三个市县，过去以贫困出名。近三年，粮食总产连续以百分之十至百分之二十的速度递增。这一变化从何而来？请看——
    “三肇”黄金浪
    周晓冰
    “三肇”，即黑龙江省的肇东、肇州、肇源三个市县的习惯称谓。松嫩平原上那条状如弯月的黑土带，紧贴着绕了过去，丢给“三肇”人的却是“旱天硬邦邦，雨后不渗汤”的贫瘠地。直到８０年代初期，这里粮食亩产不过百公斤左右，一些贫困乡村还在吃返销粮。
    可是近年来，当众多市县深为粮食生产停滞所困扰时，“三肇”却连续三年以１０％至２０％的速度递增。去年粮食总产１６．７４亿公斤，比大丰收的１９８４年增加６４．５％。这个产量占黑龙江全省粮豆总产的１／１０，而他们的耕作面积仅为全省的１／２２。素以土地贫瘠闻名的“三肇”地区，何以连续增产？这个被专家誉为“三肇黄金浪”的现象，为农业突破徘徊提供了什么样的启示？
    “软硬兼施”的投入
    用慷慨大方四个字形容“三肇”人对农业的投入，恐怕不过分。
    首先是化肥的投入，亩施量几年间增加了５—７倍。其次是农业机械的投入。据肇东市统计，去年全市大中型农用拖拉机发展到１５６４台，比大包干前增加１２．８％。再次是抗旱排涝工程的建设。四不靠水的肇州县，１９８６年以来，累计投资５１０万元，配机电井１６７０眼，修排涝干支渠４００多公里。１９８７年春旱，近百万亩的玉米只用了１５天就全部坐水种完。１９８８年秋一次降雨１８４毫米，４０万亩农田被淹，仅两天就排净了９０％地块的积水。除此，还有大量良种、农药、地膜等等。
    作为投资主体的农民，所以心甘情愿，是他们亲眼见到了投入的效应。１９８４年初，肇州县丰乐镇的一个农民从吉林背回１０公斤“四单八”玉米种，把亩产千斤由梦想变成了事实。而后，黑龙江省农科院的专家小组和肇州县委书记马殿友，一起在双发乡七户农民的１５０亩土地上进行玉米高产攻关试验，平均亩产达到６００公斤。消息传开，百万亩高产攻关活动迅速兴起。
    “高投入必需按科学投入”。采访中，我真真地感受到这种功夫。他们把良种、深耕、合理密植、测土施肥、增施微肥等新技术引进田间地头的同时，更注意把科学意识、科学办法引进庄户人头脑。例如，聘请专家教授讲学，组织科技人员下乡，开办农技推广学校，进行实用技术培训，展开规模浩大的“科技之冬”群众活动等等，基本上保证“每个农户家有一个科学种田的明白人”。是科学加投入，打开了农业高产的大门。
    以牧兴农的“中轴战略”
    这个战略，“三肇”各有具体说法，但总体意图一致。因为“三肇”草原辽阔，加之粮食丰收饲料充足，近几年畜牧业发展迅速，其中羊、牛、鸡、鹅的饲养量居全省前列。畜牧业的发展，为农业提供了大量优质农家肥。平均亩施农家肥由过去的１０００公斤增加到２５００—３０００公斤。经测查，去年“三肇”６０％左右地块的有机质含量比１９８４年增加０．３‰—０．６‰。
    在肇东市德昌乡养畜户李勤家，我听到一个有趣的故事。他家１９亩土地平均亩产７３５公斤。亩施化肥不足３０标准斤，主要靠畜粪肥田。去年春天，他让给张礼奇家一块地种甜菜，秋后平均每个甜菜头重１公斤，亩产比一般地块高一倍。在李勤的带动下，远近许多农民都走上以牧兴农的路子。去年，德昌乡户均０．８头牛、４只羊、３．６头猪。
    实现以牧兴农，价格杠杆起了驱动作用。从１９８５年到１９８８年，３种主要农业生产资料（化肥、柴油、农药）涨价幅度为７５．３％，３种主要畜产品（猪肉、鲜蛋、羊毛）涨价幅度为１０３％。对农畜兼业户来说，后者的涨轻松地抵消了前者的涨，保证了对粮食生产的投入。
    工农两业利益的“微调”
    在宏观环境恶化的情况下，农业市县怎样保护农民发展商品生产的积极性和向土地投入的热情？的确是伤脑筋的问题。“三肇”尽其所能，采取了“微调”措施，收到了良好效果。
    政府农业投资每年保持在财政总支出的８％—１２％左右，用于农田水利、大中农机具配套、农技推广和部分工业原料的价格补贴。
    鼓励以城补乡。动员和组织以农副产品为原料的加工企业和经营农副产品的商业企业，从大力扶持“第一车间”生产出发，为农民贷款贴息，优惠供应化肥、农药、农膜等物资。在１９８６至１９８７两年糖业生产不景气时期，他们就靠这种办法保护了农民种甜菜的积极性。工厂也因原料充足保持了盈利；财税部门先予后取，增加收入。
    建立健全各类农村社会化服务系统。
