Polish leader says election is a great attempt at reconciliation
Warns against anyone playing with fire

		WARSAW, June 2 (Xinhua) -- Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee First Secretary and Council of State Chairman Jaruzelski said in a televised speech last night that he hopes the entire nation will keep the country's interests at heart, and that "no one should play with fire."

		He said that elections can and should change many things within the country, but there are also invaluable, undeniable, and national qualities that will not fade, such as national sovereignty, security, alliance credibility, the bold and profound political and economic reforms confirmed by the Round Table Conference, and the consolidation of achievements, among others.

		Jaruzelski hopes that everyone will prove that the Round Table Conference was not a mistake, nor an episode, but a rational and beneficial compromise.

		He pointed out that this election is a great attempt to adhere to the path of reconciliation. Fireplay is not allowed. Choosing a path of hostility, tension, and turmoil would mean destruction for Poland.

		Jaruzelski said that he is proud that it is the Polish United Workers' Party, and not anyone else, that has conducted a bold and honest self-assessment, issued a call to itself, and stood at the forefront of change. He expressed that the party extends its hand to anyone who truly keeps the country's interests at heart, to build a grand alliance after the election, promote economic reform, enrich democratic content, and consolidate and develop the nation.

    波领导人指出选举是和解的伟大尝试
    告诫任何人都不要玩火
    新华社华沙6月2日电波兰统一工人党中央第一书记、国务委员会主席雅鲁泽尔斯基2日晚发表电视讲话时表示希望全国人民都把国家利益放在心上，任何人“都不要玩火”。
    他说，选举可以，而且应该改变国内的许多东西，但也具有不会过时的，不容怀疑和全民性质的宝贵的东西，那就是国家主权、安全、联盟信誉、圆桌会议确认的大胆深刻的政治经济改革以及对取得的成果的巩固，等等。
    雅鲁泽尔斯基希望大家来证明圆桌会议不是个错误，也不是个插曲，而是个理智而有益的妥协。
    他指出，这次选举是坚持这条和解路线的伟大尝试。不允许玩火。走敌视、紧张、动荡的路对波兰来说将意味着毁灭。
    雅鲁泽尔斯基说，他感到骄傲的是，正是波兰统一工人党——而不是其他的什么人——进行了大胆的、诚实的自我估价，向自己发出号召，站到变革的先锋队伍之中。他表示，党向每一个真正把国家利益放在心上的人伸出手来，建立一个选举之后的大联盟，促进经济改革，丰富民主内容、巩固和发展国家。
