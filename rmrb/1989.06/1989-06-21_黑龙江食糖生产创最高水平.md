Heilongjiang Province produced 583,000 tons of sugar during the 1988-1989 sugar production season, an increase of 283,000 tons compared to the previous season, setting a new historical high. Heilongjiang is one of the major sugar beet production areas in China, accounting for about half of the country's total sugar beet production. In recent years, the province has continuously adjusted the price ratio between grains and sugar beets, motivating farmers' enthusiasm. It has also renovated, expanded, and built a number of sugar factories. Currently, the province has 29 sugar factories with an annual processing capacity of 700,000 tons, nearly double the capacity of the late 1970s.

　　黑龙江食糖生产创最高水平
    新华社哈尔滨六月二十日电（记者刘常金）黑龙江省一九八八至一九八九年制糖期共产食糖五十八点三万吨，比上个制糖期多产糖二十八点三万吨，创历史最高水平。黑龙江省是我国甜菜糖的主要产区，产量约占全国甜菜糖总产量的一半。近几年，这个省不断调整粮、甜菜比价，调动了农民积极性，并改造、扩建和新建了一批糖厂。目前，全省共有二十九座糖厂，年加工能力达七十万吨，比七十年代末增加近一倍。
