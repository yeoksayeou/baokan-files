Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 4th.

The spokesperson of the Martial Law Command of the People's Liberation Army issued a statement on June 4th at 6 AM, stating that in accordance with the martial law decree issued by the State Council and the order from the Beijing Municipal Government, to stop the escalating turmoil and quickly restore order in the capital, the troops of the People's Liberation Army tasked with enforcing martial law in parts of Beijing entered their positions, including Tiananmen Square, on the night of June 3rd. This news was broadcast through television and radio stations and other news media. The martial law troops sincerely hope that the general public will support and assist the troops in this action. However, during the troops' advance and execution of duties, a small group of ruthless criminals and rioters, disregarding the law and martial law, viewed the troops' patient persuasion as weakness and took advantage of the situation. They wantonly destroyed over a hundred military vehicles, burning 31 of them, and several young soldiers were burned to death. They seized firearms and ammunition, stormed the compound of the Ministry of Radio, Film, and Television, burned a car parked inside, and damaged 7 other vehicles. They stormed the Great Hall of the People, smashing its doors and windows. They used various violent means to kidnap and injure troops and public security personnel, injuring over a thousand officers and soldiers on duty. Particularly outrageous was their use of various despicable methods to obstruct the military and local medical personnel from rescuing the injured soldiers, preventing the wounded from being loaded onto ambulances, and preventing them from being sent to hospitals. They wantonly obstructed and destroyed ambulances carrying the wounded. The brutal facts show that they are a group of inhuman rioters who have created a counter-revolutionary riot in our capital.

To protect the lives and property of the people, which have been threatened, and for the fundamental interests of the state and the nation, in accordance with the martial law decree of the State Council, the troops tasked with enforcing martial law, in an unbearable situation, were forced to take decisive measures in accordance with the law to severely punish a small group of counter-revolutionary rioters. They are currently clearing Tiananmen Square, which has been used by a small number of people with ulterior motives as a base for spreading rumors and illegal activities for more than a month. The measures taken by the martial law troops are completely legal and unavoidable.

As the People's Liberation Army, which bears the sacred duty of defending the country and protecting the peaceful labor of the people, we will unshakably carry out the martial law decree of the State Council. We solemnly warn the small group of rioters to stop immediately all illegal activities that violate martial law and obstruct military duties, otherwise, we will take legal and severe measures to crack down on them.

　　戒严部队指挥部发言人发表谈话
    新华社北京６月４日电  人民解放军戒严部队指挥部发言人６月４日６时发表谈话说，根据国务院戒严令和北京市政府令，为制止日趋发展的动乱，尽快恢复首都秩序，执行北京部分地区戒严任务的人民解放军官兵，于６月３日奉命进驻包括天安门广场在内的各个执勤位置。这一消息于当晚通过电视台、广播电台等新闻媒介作了报道，戒严部队诚恳希望广大人民群众支持和协助部队这一行动。然而，在部队开进和执行军务中，一小撮丧心病狂的歹徒和暴乱分子，置法律和戒严令于不顾，把部队官兵的耐心劝阻视为软弱可欺，肆无忌惮地砸毁军用汽车上百辆，烧毁３１辆，有数名年轻的战士被活活烧死。他们抢截枪支弹药，冲击广播电影电视部大院，烧毁了停放在院内的一辆汽车，并砸坏了７辆汽车。他们冲击人民大会堂，砸坏人民大会堂的门窗。他们用各种暴力手段，绑架和杀伤部队官兵和公安干警，打伤千余名执行军务的指战员。尤其令人愤慨的是，他们用各种卑劣手段阻止军队和地方医务人员抢救被他们打伤的部队官兵，不准将伤员抬上救护车，不准送往医院，肆意拦阻、砸毁载有负伤人员的救护车。残酷的事实表明，他们是一伙惨无人性的暴徒，在我们的首都制造了一场反革命暴乱。
    为了维护已经受到威胁的人民的生命财产，为了国家和民族的根本利益，根据国务院戒严令，执行戒严任务的部队在忍无可忍的情况下，被迫依法采取了坚决的措施，严惩一小撮反革命暴徒，并正在清理一个多月来被极少数别有用心的人作为制造谣言和各种非法活动基地的天安门广场。戒严部队所采取的这些措施，是完全符合法律的，是迫不得已的。
    作为担负保卫祖国和保卫人民和平劳动神圣职责的人民解放军，将坚定不移地执行国务院戒严令。我们严正警告一小撮制造暴乱的反革命暴乱分子，必须悬崖勒马，停止一切违反戒严令和妨碍军务的违法活动，否则，我们将依法严厉打击。
