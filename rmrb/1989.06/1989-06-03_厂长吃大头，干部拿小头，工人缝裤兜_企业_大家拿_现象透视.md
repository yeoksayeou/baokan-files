Title: "Factory Director Takes the Big Share, Cadres Take the Small Share, Workers Patch Their Pockets"

The saying goes: “There’s a Canada abroad, and there’s ‘everyone takes a share’ at home.” In recent years, the phenomenon of “everyone takes a share”—internal theft—has been worsening in some enterprises.

Internal Theft Persists

A major cigarette factory in China suffered approximately 110,000 yuan in economic losses due to severe internal theft in 1988.

In a certain city, a factory producing high-grade chocolate candies has workers whose lunch boxes are never empty when they go home. At the end of their shifts, they fill their boxes with chocolate, effectively doubling or tripling their daily wages.

In a certain factory’s weaving workshop, an investigation revealed that out of 36 people, only the workshop director and one elderly worker did not steal bedsheets. The remaining 34 individuals were all involved in this semi-public “everyone takes a share” scheme.

Easy to Fence Stolen Goods

A worker named Cui from a pharmaceutical factory in Tianjin began stealing red mycetin and other drugs from the factory in 1986. Over two years, he stole over 340,000 pills. Drug collectors from Anhui would come to his home at regular intervals to buy the stolen goods.

In one factory, high-grade tin was stolen, and the thieves were employees of the factory. The receivers of the stolen goods would meet with the thieves at designated times and places, then coordinate with a state-owned factory in Hebei Province. The factory would send a truck to transport the stolen goods to a township enterprise, which was desperately in need of materials and had dispatched numerous people to purchase high-grade tin at high prices. The receivers and the internal thieves worked in perfect harmony, forming a complete chain of theft, transportation, and sale.

What’s the Root Cause?

The idea of “everyone takes a share, take a big share, and if you don’t take it, you’re missing out” is spreading, posing a serious question. Every country and every era will have theft, which is directly related to the thief’s personal bad character. However, in China’s current enterprises where internal theft is severe, are there other reasons? The rapid development of new enterprises, coupled with insufficient and continuously rising raw material prices, has led some enterprises to desperately “find rice to cook.” This objectively stimulates the occurrence of internal theft cases.

When enterprises experience internal theft, the state suffers the losses, and enterprise leaders do not lose a single cent. Therefore, poor systems and lax law enforcement are another reason for the frequent occurrence of internal theft.

Workers have a saying: “The factory director takes the big share, cadres take the small share, and workers patch their pockets.” “All factory workers are thieves, not like the leaders who can make a quick profit.” These satirical sayings might also reflect some improper practices?

An elderly worker nearing 60 said: “Just after liberation, leaders ate bitterness first and enjoyed later. Now, some cadres enjoy first and then eat bitterness.”

A worker recounted an incident: A factory leader had the factory’s driver use the company car to transport factory timber to his home. The driver thought, “It’s not fair for the director to benefit alone; I should get some too.” So, he unloaded some of the timber for himself on the way and then honestly reported to the director. The director did not scold him but laughed instead. After that, the director no longer hid anything from the driver when doing wrong things. How great is the corrupting influence of such “personal example”!

### “厂长吃大头，干部拿小头，工人缝裤兜”  企业“大家拿”现象透视

    “厂长吃大头，干部拿小头，工人缝裤兜”
    企业“大家拿”现象透视
    民谚云：“外国有个加拿大，中国有个大家拿。”近年来，某些企业职工的“大家拿”——内盗现象，有愈演愈烈之势。
    内盗不绝　我国一家生产卷烟的大厂，由于内盗现象严重，1988年一年造成的经济损失约11万元。
    某市生产高级巧克力奶糖的工厂，工人们的饭盒从不空着回家。下班时装上满满一盒巧克力，使他们一天的工资增加两三倍。
    某工厂有个织布车间，据查，全车间36个人，只有车间主任和一名老工人没有偷床单，其余34个人，都参与了这种半公开的“大家拿”。
    销赃不愁　天津一家制药厂的工人崔某，从1986年开始，两年之中从厂内盗出红霉素、甲晴咪呱等药34万余片。安徽收药人定时到他家来收购。
    一个工厂的高锡被盗，偷盗者是厂内职工，收赃者按指定时间、地点与偷盗者接头，再与河北省一个国营工厂联系，由该厂派车将赃物运到某乡镇企业，这个乡镇企业正等米下锅，派出大批人员到处高价收购高锡呢！收赃者与厂内的偷盗者配合默契，形成了偷、运、销“一条龙”。
    症结何在　“大家拿、拿大家、不拿白不拿”的思潮泛滥，向人们提出了一个严肃的课题。任何国家、任何时期都会出现偷盗现象，这与偷盗者个人的恶劣品行有直接的关系，但是，在我国目前内盗严重的企业里是否还有其他原因呢？新兴企业大批上马，原材料供应不足而且不断涨价，使得某些企业到处“找米下锅”，这从客观上刺激了内盗案的发生；
    企业出现内盗，受损失的是国家，企业领导者不会有一丝一毫损失，因此，制度不善、执法不严，这是内盗频仍的又一原因；
    工人中流传着这样的顺口溜：“厂长吃大头、干部拿小头、工人缝个大裤兜”。“工厂工人都是贼，不如当头儿的捞一回。”这些揶揄性的民谚是否也可以说是某些不正之风的折光？
    一位年近60岁的老工人说：刚解放那阵，当领导的吃苦在前，享受在后，现在的有些干部却享受在先，得捞就捞。
    一位工人说了这样一件事：有个工厂的领导让厂内司机用公车往自己家中拉厂内的木料，司机心想：“不能光让厂长个人白得，我也要沾点儿便宜”，于是他在拉料途中为自家卸下一部分，而后如实向厂长汇报了，厂长没批评，反而笑了。以后办歪事，厂长再不避讳司机。这种“身教”的腐蚀作用有多大？！
