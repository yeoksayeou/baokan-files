North Korean political parties and social organizations call for international support for Korean unification struggle

	BEIJING, June 23 (Xinhua) -- On the eve of the "June 25-July 27 Anti-American Joint Struggle Month," the political parties and social organizations of North Korea issued a joint appeal on June 23, calling on the people of the world to support North Korea's peaceful reunification. The appeal strongly demands that the U.S. government fundamentally change its policy of dividing Korea, adapt to the trend of dialogue and détente, and enable Korea to achieve peaceful reunification as soon as possible.

	The appeal points out that the current state of Korea, which is full of war dangers, is contrary to the trend of détente in the times. The appeal strongly demands that the United States respond to the North Korean government's proposal for North Korea-U.S. talks and tripartite talks.

	The appeal finally calls on the governments, political parties, parliaments, and social organizations of various countries in the world, as well as peace-loving people, to support and assist the Korean Workers' Party and the government in their struggle to force U.S. troops to withdraw from South Korea, turn the Korean Peninsula into a non-nuclear peace zone, eliminate the danger of war, and achieve self-reliant and peaceful reunification of Korea through dialogue and consultation.

    本报平壤６月２３日电  记者徐宝康报道：在“６月２５日—７月２７日反美共同斗争月”前夕，朝鲜各政党、社会团体于６月２３日发表联合呼吁书，呼吁世界各国人民支持朝鲜的和平统一，并强烈要求美国政府彻底改变分裂朝鲜的政策，以适应对话和缓和的潮流，使朝鲜早日实现和平统一。
    呼吁书指出，朝鲜目前继续存在的这种充满战争危险的状态，是与时代的缓和潮流相违背的。呼吁书强烈要求，美国应当响应朝鲜政府提出的朝美会谈和三方会谈的建议。
    呼吁书最后呼吁，世界各国政府、政党、国会和社会团体及爱好和平的人们，支持和声援朝鲜劳动党和政府为迫使美军撤出南朝鲜，把朝鲜半岛变成无核和平区，以及消除战争危险，通过对话协商自主和平统一朝鲜的斗争。
