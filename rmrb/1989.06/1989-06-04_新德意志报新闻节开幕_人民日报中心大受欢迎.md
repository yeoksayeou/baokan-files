The People's Daily and the New Germany Newspaper exchanged greetings today in Berlin. Along the roads in the Friedrich-Ebert-Park, bright red five-star flags were hanging, and slogans in both Chinese and German such as "Welcome People's Daily," "People's Daily Greets New Germany Newspaper," and "New Germany Newspaper Greets People's Daily" were highly noticeable.

The 30th New Germany Newspaper Festival opened here today. A distinctive feature of this festival is that the People's Daily of China was invited as an honorary guest, and a center with an area of 10,000 square meters was specially set up, which was warmly welcomed by people from all walks of life in Berlin.

In the afternoon, Hermann, a member of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany, and Naumann, a member of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and the editor-in-chief of the New Germany Newspaper, along with other leaders of the German Democratic Republic, visited the "People's Daily Center." They were warmly welcomed by Fan Rongkang, the deputy editor-in-chief of the People's Daily and the head of the delegation, and Zhang Dake, the Chinese ambassador to the German Democratic Republic. The two sides had a friendly conversation and drank Chinese tea together.

Today, people from all walks of life in Berlin enthusiastically participated in the festival activities. The rich and colorful activities in the "People's Daily Center" attracted great interest. The performances by the Hubei Folk Art Troupe and the Hengnan Acrobatic Troupe from China attracted a large audience. The exhibition of pictures and videos introducing the achievements of China's socialist construction and the situation of the People's Daily helped more people in the German Democratic Republic to deepen their understanding of China. The Chinese handicrafts and Chinese-style fast food sold here were also very popular. Several editors and reporters from the People's Daily, who were invited to participate in the festival activities, met with people from the German Democratic Republic. Many people from the German Democratic Republic lined up to have their names written in Chinese by Chinese colleagues using a brush. People from the German Democratic Republic generally felt happy to have the opportunity to participate in such activities. One friend from the German Democratic Republic said, "Coming to the 'People's Daily Center' is like coming to China." Another friend from the German Democratic Republic told the reporter that he had been to China in the 1950s and he was happy to see the developing relations between the German Democratic Republic and China.

Editor-in-Chief Naumann of the New Germany Newspaper pointed out that the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and Comrade Honecker attach great importance to this activity. Holding this activity in the year when both China and the German Democratic Republic celebrate their 40th anniversaries of founding and establishing diplomatic relations will play a positive role in further developing the relations between the two parties and the two countries.
