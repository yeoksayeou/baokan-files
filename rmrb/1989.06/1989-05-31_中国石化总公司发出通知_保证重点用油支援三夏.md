China Petrochemical Corporation's sales company recently issued an urgent notice to various provincial, autonomous region, and municipal oil sales units and production enterprises, requiring careful arrangement of the oil market and ensuring the supply of key oil needs.

According to reports, in recent years, the supply of oil products has been insufficient, coupled with tight transportation, leading to insufficient oil reserves in many areas and a very tight market supply. Some regions have already experienced shortages. Currently, the agricultural "three summer" period is approaching, and oil demand is surging. Therefore, China Petrochemical Corporation requires relevant units to make careful arrangements and prioritize the supply of oil for the agricultural three summer period, ensuring oil for disaster relief, flood prevention, grain and essential living supplies transportation, urban public buses, long-distance passenger transport, and other urgent needs as arranged by local governments. Oil for internal combustion locomotives and transportation and navigation must be supplied according to the plan. General oil supplies will be reduced based on resource availability.

To stabilize the market, sales units must maintain a certain amount of inventory for emergency needs. Production enterprises and shipping units must prioritize the shipment of state-mandated plans and strictly execute the emergency tasks assigned by the sales company.

　　中国石化总公司发出通知
    保证重点用油支援三夏
    新华社北京５月３１日电（记者赵明亮）中国石油化工总公司销售公司日前向各省、自治区、直辖市成品油销售及各生产企业发出紧急通知，要求精心安排好石油成品油市场，切实做好重点用油的供应工作。
    据介绍，近年来成品油资源不足，再加上交通运输紧张的原因，许多地区成品油库存不足，市场供应十分紧张，少数地区已出现脱销现象。目前农业“三夏”在即，用油剧增。为此，中国石化公司要求有关单位精心安排，重点保证农业三夏用油，保证救灾防汛、粮食和生活必需品运输、城市公共汽车、长途客运用油以及当地政府安排的急需用油。对铁路内燃机车和交通航运用油要按计划兑现。对一般用油视资源情况予以压缩供应。
    为稳定市场，各销售单位务必保留一定数量的库存以应急需。各生产企业、各发运单位要优先发运国家指令性计划，并严格执行销售公司下达的急调任务。
