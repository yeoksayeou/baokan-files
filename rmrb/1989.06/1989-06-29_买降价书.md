Buying Discounted Books
Lin Qi

Older generations of literary figures were often frequent visitors to Liu Li Chang. Mr. Zheng Zhen Diao bought a book he was satisfied with and repeatedly exclaimed, "It's wonderful!" His expression and tone not only left a lasting impression on his fellow traveler, Mr. Ye Shao Tao, but his joy was so palpable that it transcends the pages, enough for us latecomers to share.

Nowadays, antique books are becoming increasingly expensive, so expensive that we dare not even look at the price tags.

Thus, the phrase "going to Liu Li Chang" from the mouths of older literary figures has turned into "going to buy discounted books" for us.

My home is near the Summer Palace in Xiyuan. On Sundays, when going out to buy discounted books, there is a fixed route: take the 332 bus to Huangzhuang Station. The first stop is the Haidian Cultural Book Society. From there, continue on the 332 bus to Baishizi Bridge Station, the second stop is the International Book Trade Company's bookstore at the south gate of the Capital Gymnasium. From this bookstore, cross the street, take the 107 tram to Xinkai Hutong Station, enter Bei Wei Hutong, and the third stop is the discounted bookstore under the jurisdiction of the Xicheng District New Hua Bookstore. These three discounted bookstores have made me excited more than once. For example, I once bought a brand new copy of Feng Zikai's "Yuan Yuan Tang Random Notes" for one yuan; I bought a beautifully printed "Four Kinds of Qing Dynasty Poetry Criticism" for one yuan and twenty jiao; I bought "Feng Yuan Jun's Creative Translation Collection" for eight jiao, and most unforgettable, I bought a copy of Wang Yao's masterpiece "Collection of Essays on the History of Medieval Literature" for four jiao...

Shopping at discounted bookstores, of course, is to seek bargains. Books from a few years ago, even if not discounted, are quite affordable by today's standards. If they are further discounted by six or seven tenths, it's almost like getting them for free. With ten yuan in my pocket, I can "strut" into the discounted bookstore because this ten yuan can buy at least ten decent books with some preservation value. However, the joy of shopping at discounted bookstores is not just about finding bargains. The three discounted bookstores are not very large, some are even quite crowded, but crowded with books, not people. There are no counters in the stores, only bookshelves. Thus, when we pick books, we not only feel that the distance between us and the books has almost disappeared in the quiet atmosphere, but we can also find endless charm in the limited space where "one can rest one's knees and shoulders." The atmosphere in the three discounted bookstores is very good. We went to Haidian Cultural Book Society and Baishizi Bridge Bookstore twice at noon, and the aroma of home-cooked meals from the iron pots made the store warm and cozy; the few elderly women in the Bei Wei Hutong discounted bookstore were very friendly. While we were picking books, they were reading, and when we finished picking, they would wrap the books while slowly and gently saying a few words. Since we are regular customers, we are familiar with the situation, and our book buying adds even more fun. A quick browse through the bookshelves, and it's clear which books are original and which are new. Seeing the original books is like meeting an old friend; seeing new books is like making a new acquaintance. Discovering that the few remaining copies of the book I bought last time have been bought by others makes me feel as if several unnamed friends are smiling at me; seeing that the books we didn't buy are also not bought by others makes me secretly think that my taste is not bad.

Exiting Bei Wei Hutong, and crossing the alley opposite, you arrive at the bustling New Street Market. After buying spiritual nourishment, of course, you also need to stock up on physical nourishment. The leisurely stroll of four or five people quickly turns into the hustle and bustle of countless people, and the scent of books turns into the sweetness of fruits and the smell of fish and shrimp. This is another kind of enjoyment.

　　买降价书
    林琪
    老一辈文人大多是琉璃厂的常客。郑振铎先生买了一本满意的旧书后连声说：“好得弗得了！”那神色，那语调，不仅令同行的好友叶圣陶终生难忘，而且喜悦之情溢出纸面，足够我们这些晚生后学分享的。
    现在的古旧书是越来越贵了，贵得我们连标价牌都不敢看。
    于是乎，老一辈文人常挂在口头的那句“逛琉璃厂去”，到我们嘴里就变成“买降价书去”了。
    我家居颐和园附近的西苑，星期天外出买降价书有一条固定的路线：乘３３２路汽车到黄庄下，第一站是海淀文化书社。从那里出来继续乘３３２路汽车到白石桥下，第二站是首都体育馆南门左边的国际图书贸易总公司书刊门市部。从这家门市部出来过马路，搭上１０７路电车到新开胡同下，入北魏胡同，第三站便是西城区新华书店下属的降价书店。这三家降价书店都曾让我不止一次地激动过。比如，我曾用一元钱买了一本崭新的丰子恺著《缘缘堂随笔集》；用一元二角钱买了一本印刷精美的《清人说诗四种》；用八角钱买了一本《冯沅君创作译文集》，最难忘的是用四角钱买了一本王瑶先生的大作《中古文学史论集》……
    逛降价书店，当然是图便宜，前几年的书即使不降价，在现在也算很便宜了，如果再打上六折七折，那简直等于白送。口袋里揣十元钱，便可以“大摇大摆”地进降价书店，因为这十元钱总可以买上十本像模像样的有保存价值的书。不过，逛降价书店的乐趣决不仅仅在于捡便宜。这三家降价书店的面积均不大，有的还很拥挤，但拥挤的是书而不是人。店里没有柜台，只有书架。这样，我们挑书时，不仅在静悄悄的氛围中感到自己和书的距离几乎消失了，而且能在“可以容膝，可以息肩”的有限空间里寻出无限的韵致来。三家降价书店的气氛都很好。我们有两次是中午到海淀文化书社和白石桥书刊门市部的，大铁炉上的饭盒里发出家常便饭的香味，使店内一片温馨；北魏胡同降价书店的几位老太太一团和气，我们挑书的时候她们在看书，我们挑好后，她们一边包扎一边还会慢声细语地说几句什么。由于是常客，情况熟悉了，我们的购书又平添许多乐趣，浏览一遍书架，哪些书是原有的，哪些书是新上的，一目了然。见到原有的书，如遇故人；看到新上的书，如逢新交。发现上次自己买的那种书，剩下的几本也被别人买走了，便仿佛看见几位不知名的朋友在向我们微笑；看到我们不买的书别人也没买，又会暗自认为自己的眼光不差。
    出北魏胡同，再穿过对面的一条胡同，便是新街口闹市了。买好精神食粮，当然也得采购些物质食粮，四五个人的悠哉游哉，很快变成无数人的摩肩擦背，书香也变成水果甜鱼虾腥了，这又别是一番情趣。
