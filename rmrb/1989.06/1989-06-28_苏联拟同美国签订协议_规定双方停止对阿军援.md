According to Pakistani newspaper reports today, Soviet First Deputy Foreign Minister and Ambassador to Afghanistan Vorontsov said in Kabul that the Soviet Union is prepared to sign an agreement with the United States to halt the provision of weapons and equipment to their respective supported factions in Afghanistan.

According to the report, Vorontsov made these remarks in a recent interview with Reuters. He said that the Soviet Union will propose this agreement during the U.S.-Soviet talks to be held in Moscow on July 31st. "This is an effective measure to achieve a ceasefire in Afghanistan. If the United States and the Soviet Union agree to stop military aid now, the fighting will immediately cease." "The problem is that both the Kabul government and the guerrilla forces can obtain weapons very cheaply and easily from Moscow and Washington, and their demands are endless."

Vorontsov further stated, "It is immoral to continue pushing the Afghan people into war." The Soviet Union has learned a "very expensive lesson" from this war, with approximately 15,000 Soviet soldiers losing their lives on the Afghan battlefield. He continued, "Military means cannot solve the Afghan problem."

　　苏联拟同美国签订协议  规定双方停止对阿军援
    本报伊斯兰堡６月２８日电  记者任毓骏报道：据巴基斯坦报纸今日消息，苏联第一副外长兼驻阿富汗大使沃龙佐夫在喀布尔说，苏联准备同美国签订一项协议，规定两个超级大国同时停止向各自在阿富汗支持的一方提供武器装备。
    据报道，沃龙佐夫是在日前接受路透社记者采访时说这番话的。他说，苏联将于７月３１日在莫斯科举行的美苏会谈中提议签订这一协议，“这是在阿富汗实现停战的有效措施，如果美苏两国同意现在就停止军援，战火马上就会停熄。”“问题在于，喀布尔政府和游击方面都可极其廉价而又容易地从莫斯科和华盛顿得到武器，它们的要求没有止境”。
    沃龙佐夫还说：“把阿富汗人民继续推向战争是不道德的。”苏联已经从这场战争中取得了“代价昂贵的教训”，约有１．５万名苏联士兵葬身阿富汗战场。他继续说，军事手段解决不了阿富汗问题。
