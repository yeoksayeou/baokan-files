The European Community Commission announced on May 30 that the Council of Ministers of the Community had adopted a forestry action program proposed by the Commission in September of last year.

This program has four main points: protecting the existing forests within the Community; developing forestry in rural and underdeveloped areas; assisting small and medium-sized enterprises in the Community with the processing and sale of forest products; and supporting the conversion of farmland to forestry to avoid agricultural overproduction.

According to this program, the Community will establish a permanent forestry committee, whose role will be to provide advice for the implementation of the program and to be responsible for the management of forest protection. At the same time, a European Forest Information System will be created to collect information from the Community's forestry departments.

According to official statistics from the Community, the forest coverage rate is 20%; the forestry sector employs more than 2 million people, and the annual wood production is 115 million cubic meters.

　　欧共体为保护森林
    通过林业行动纲领
    新华社布鲁塞尔电  欧洲共同体委员会５月３０日宣布，共同体部长理事会于前一天通过了委员会在去年９月提出的一项林业行动纲领。
    这一纲领有４个重点，即：保护共同体内现有的森林；发展农村地区和落后地区的林业；帮助共同体有关中小企业林业产品加工和销售；支持改田为林以避免农业生产过剩。
    根据这一纲领，共同体将成立一个森林常设委员会，其作用是为纲领的实施提供咨询，并负责对森林保护的管理，同时还将创设一欧洲森林情报体系，收集共同体林业部门的信息。
    据共同体官方统计，共同体的森林覆盖率为２０％；林业部门就业人数超过２００万，年产木材１．１５亿立方米。
