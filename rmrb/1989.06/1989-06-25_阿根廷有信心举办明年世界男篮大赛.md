Argentina has expressed confidence in hosting next year's men's basketball world championship. The organizing committee of the Argentina World Basketball Championship recently wrote to the International Basketball Federation (FIBA), assuring that Argentina will be able to host the 1990 World Basketball Championship as scheduled. FIBA Secretary-General Boris Stankovic had previously sent a telegram to the Argentine Basketball Federation, expressing doubts about whether Argentina could host the championship in August 1990 due to recent political instability in the country. The committee's letter was a response to this telegram. Committee Chairman Hugo Montivero traveled to Mexico City on the 13th to deliver a personal letter from newly elected Argentine President Carlos Menem to the Pan American Basketball Federation. The letter stated that Argentina is capable of hosting the tournament next year, as the situation in the country is improving. "Argentina has never considered canceling this competition."

　　阿根廷有信心举办明年世界男篮大赛
    阿根廷世界篮球锦标赛组委会前不久写信给国际篮联，保证阿根廷能如期举办一九九○年世界篮球锦标赛。国际篮联秘书长博·斯坦科维奇曾打电报给阿根廷篮协。电报说，由于阿根廷最近以来的动荡局势，对阿方是否能于明年八月举办世界篮球锦标赛表示质疑。锦标赛组委会的信就是对以上电报的回答。组委会主任乌戈·蒙蒂维罗于十三日去墨西哥城，把新当选的阿根廷总统梅内姆的一封私人信件交给泛美篮球联合会。信中说，阿根廷能够举办明年的比赛，因为阿根廷的形势越来越好，“阿根廷从未考虑取消这一比赛”。
