Once-paralyzed urban traffic in Wuhan has been gradually returning to normal since June 8.

Since June, various key transportation routes such as the Yangtze River Bridge and the Hanyang Interchange have experienced incidents of roadblocks, train interruptions, and looting of fruit stalls. As a result, public transportation in the entire city was temporarily suspended. Starting from June 8, units such as the Wuhan Bus Company and the Tram Company promptly organized personnel to repair vehicles and clear roadblocks. This not only restored normal operations for passenger and freight transportation on Wuhan's railways but also resumed normal public transportation within the city. By the afternoon of June 8, all 96 bus and tram routes, 17 ferry lines, and 2 ferryboat routes in the city had been fully reopened. The number of vehicles in operation has reached over 1,400, basically returning to normal operational levels.

　　抢修车辆　清除路障
    武汉交通秩序恢复正常
    新华社武汉６月１０日电  （记者熊金超、张松青）曾一度瘫痪的武汉城市交通，从８日起趋于正常。
    ６月以来，长江大桥、汉阳立交桥等交通要道上，先后出现了设置障碍、拦截列车、哄抢水果摊等现象，全市公共交通一度中断。从８日开始，市公汽公司、电车公司等单位及时组织人力抢修车辆，清除路障，不仅使武汉地区铁路客货运输转入正常营运，也使市内公共交通恢复正常。到８日下午，全市９６条公共汽车、电车线路、１７条轮渡和两条汽渡航线已全部开通。投入营运车辆已达１４００余辆，基本接近正常营运水平。
