Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 15th.

Some rioters involved in the mutilation of soldier Cai Guojing have been arrested.

According to information from relevant departments in Beijing, some rioters who participated in the mutilation of soldier Cai Guojing at the Chongwenmen overpass on June 4th have been apprehended by a certain unit of the martial law troops and the public security authorities.

The criminal Zhao Yuetang is a farmer from Jingzhou, Hubei Province. According to his initial confession, on June 4th at the Chongwenmen overpass, he saw a group of thugs pouring gasoline on Cai Guojing. He then poured a bottle of gasoline on Cai and, along with other rioters, hung Cai under the overpass. Zhao then took out a match, lit it, and threw it onto the soldier, burning him alive. Additionally, Zhao confessed to using a Molotov cocktail to burn a military vehicle and stabbing a soldier with a knife.

The criminal Yang Shizeng was a worker at a hospital in Chongwen District. On the afternoon of June 4th, he saw a group of rioters mutilating soldier Cai Guojing at the Chongwenmen overpass and joined them in throwing the already unconscious Cai off the bridge.

The criminal Li Weidong is unemployed and relies on government subsidies for living. He has been detained by the public security authorities before. On the afternoon of June 4th, he, along with several other rioters, hung the body of the fallen soldier back up on the bridge. Afterwards, Li brazenly boasted on the street: "We are about to establish a provisional government. Hanging that corpse was my doing. Even if you report it to the police, I am not afraid."

Currently, the public security authorities are expediting the trial of this case and continuing to pursue other criminals.

    新华社北京６月１５日电  据北京市有关部门提供的消息，６月４日在崇文门过街天桥参与残害解放军战士崔国政的部分暴徒，已由戒严部队某部和公安机关抓获归案。
    案犯赵跃堂，是湖北省荆州地区农民。据他初步交待，６月４日在崇文门过街桥上，他看见一伙歹徒正在往崔国政身上倒汽油，他便将一瓶汽油倒在崔国政身上，随后又和其他暴徒一起将崔吊在过街桥下。赵犯掏出火柴划燃扔到战士身上，将其活活烧死。此外，赵犯还交待了用燃烧瓶烧了一辆军车、用刀子刺一名战士的罪行。
    案犯杨世增，原崇文区某医院工人。６月４日下午，他在崇文门过街桥上看到一伙暴徒正在残害解放军战士崔国政，便上前与这伙暴徒一起将已经昏迷的崔国政扔下来。
    案犯李卫东，无业，平日靠政府救济为生，曾被公安机关拘留过。６月４日下午，他伙同几名暴徒把已掉下桥的烈士尸体再次吊上去。事后，李又在街道上猖狂扬言：“我们马上要成立临时政府。吊那个尸体是我干的，告给警察我也不怕。”
    目前，公安机关已抓紧审理此案，并继续缉捕其他案犯。
