This is a true story. The conversations are real, but names cannot be mentioned because the events took place on the street.

In the evening, on a street corner of Huaihai West Road, a crowd gathered, discussing national affairs and the current complex situation.

A young man sighed, "Nowadays, there are endless rumors, and we keep falling for them."

A man in a plaid shirt, riding a bicycle, suddenly stopped and hurriedly asked, "What happened? What happened?"

"What happened? Yesterday afternoon, the loudspeaker of the 'High Autonomous Federation' broadcasted that the 38th Army had mutinied and was fighting with the 27th Army. Deng Xiaoping was so angry that he died."

"Really? I knew this would happen," the man in the plaid shirt said excitedly.

"You knew! Damn it, it's a rumor!" the young man angrily retorted.

The man in the plaid shirt also angrily said, "How can it be a rumor? The students have reliable information; they even know the military unit numbers, how can it be false?"

"Did you watch the evening news last night?" someone interjected.

"..."

A middle-aged man who looked like a worker said, "The Central Television has officially refuted this."

"Which bastard spread such a malicious rumor?" someone muttered.

A young man wearing glasses said, "I listened to the broadcast from Taiwan, and it was them who broadcasted this news."

"Foolishly believed it!" the first young man sighed and shook his head.

"Falling for rumors is not just this one time," a retired teacher or cadre wearing bifocals said, putting down his evening newspaper and turning to join the conversation. "When the Beijing students went on a hunger strike, everyone was worried. Suddenly, news came that three students had died, with names and everything. Everyone was very sad, and some quickly put on black armbands and carried wreaths to march in protest. It turned out to be a big lie. Later, it was said that two old marshals opposed the central decision. I thought it might be possible. We older people just want peace and oppose radical actions. But after two days, the two marshals spoke, and it was published in the newspaper. This rumor was debunked. Then, it was said that Deng Yingchao did this and that. This time, I was more cautious. Comrade Zhou Enlai and Comrade Deng Yingchao are models of discipline; they would never oppose the central government. Sure enough, the next day, Deng Yingchao's letter was published in the newspaper, and it turned out to be another rumor."

"There was also news that dozens of Standing Committee members of the National People's Congress signed a petition to dismiss Li Peng. In our alley, a few people from the countryside had already bought firecrackers to celebrate the victory! Now, some Standing Committee members have stated that they did not sign, and some said they signed to request a meeting to discuss the situation. However, a Hong Kong newspaper published a letter adding the demand to dismiss Li Peng. I saw in a friend's place that this Hong Kong newspaper has already apologized for this," an old man said.

"All these rumors are spread by Hong Kong and Taiwan newspapers and radio stations. In the past, we ordinary people didn't see or hear or know about these things. This time, I finally experienced the taste of capitalist press freedom," the middle-aged worker said.

"This can't be said that way. 'Voice of America' is very objective and fair," the man in the plaid shirt retorted. "It says what is true is true, and for unreliable information, it honestly says it is unconfirmed news, and this news needs further verification."

"This is a more cunning way of spreading rumors," the middle-aged worker also did not back down. "When spreading rumors, adding a phrase like 'unconfirmed news,' the result is that the rumor becomes news. Since it is unconfirmed, what are you reporting? Isn't this intentionally harming people?"

"Too complicated, really endless rumors, and endless deceptions, sigh!" the first young man sighed again.

Before he finished speaking, a female worker, obviously the young man's wife, ran out of a nearby house with a bottle, shouting, "We're out of soy sauce, quickly go and buy half a kilogram, I'm cooking dinner, hurry up, don't just stand on the street chatting nonsense."

"Eh—sister, you can't say that, we are concerned about national affairs," the young man in the plaid shirt immediately flattered.

"What national affairs? We ordinary people don't understand these things. Do you know the situation? I can't even figure out the affairs of a factory, how can you figure out the national situation?" Obviously, this female worker was a capable and outspoken woman, speaking quickly and clearly.

"We are just exchanging information," her husband seemed a bit timid but couldn't back down in front of so many people, struggling to argue.

"Oh! Just relying on you guys' street news, you can exchange information and decide national affairs, then let the mayors and premiers step down."

"This sister, we are street news, but 'Voice of America' is official news, right?" the young man in the plaid shirt proudly raised his head.

"Chinese people don't listen to their own government, but listen to 'Voice of America.' Foreigners give you salary, bonuses, food to eat, and clothes to wear? I don't have as much news as you. I only believe in one thing: if China is messed up, the ones who suffer are still us Chinese people. What are you still standing here for? No soy sauce, do you want to eat dinner or not?" The female worker spoke like a machine gun, firing on both sides.

The young worker silently took the soy sauce bottle and left. The young man in the plaid shirt, while saying, "Sister, don't put labels on people," quickly pushed his bicycle away, still muttering, "The remnants of the class struggle are too deep."

The female worker didn't bother with him either and went back inside to cook. The remaining people were silent for a while and then continued their previous conversation.

"The reason there are so many rumors is that our newspapers, radio stations, and TVs have too little information. There was a counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing. Look, the streets are full of Hong Kong and Taiwan newspapers saying it's the 'Black June 3rd,' with blood flowing in Tiananmen Square. But we don't have a single detailed report or a single photo. You want the ordinary people to believe whom? If the right path is blocked, naturally, the wrong path will flourish..." the middle-aged worker said discontentedly.

"That's right. It's been almost a week, and only now has Yuan Mu spoken on TV that the troops in Tiananmen Square agreed to the students' peaceful withdrawal and that there was no conflict. The total number of deaths is 300. Is it not okay to announce that 300 people died in suppressing a riot? Even in the Soviet Union, hundreds of people died in a train station explosion!" The young man with glasses also indignantly agreed. "I really don't know what those central propaganda departments are doing?"

"You can't say that either," the retired teacher or cadre said. "To spread rumors, you just need to open your mouth, of course, it's fast and irresponsible. But to publish the facts and refute rumors, you need to take some time to investigate and verify, of course, it will be slower."

"That makes sense, but it's too slow. This is news dissemination, not a central document, why do you need to scrutinize every sentence? By the time you scrutinize it, the ordinary people might have already followed the rumors."

"Yes, people always have a tendency to believe first and then doubt. Once they believe the rumors, they won't easily believe the truth. If rumors have no effect, why do people spread them?"

The young man who bought the soy sauce returned just in time to hear this sentence and couldn't help but stop and say, "Hey—really, you say, those who spread rumors and are refuted, why do they keep spreading rumors?"

"Didn't the central government say this is a political struggle?"

"Then why do people keep falling for it, and some still believe and spread the rumors?"

"Hey, to boost their courage!"

"Don't talk nonsense, maybe the troublemakers need courage, but what courage do I need?" the young man unhappily said.

"We are all kind-hearted ordinary people. We believe the rumors, get deceived, regret it; new rumors come, we believe again, get deceived again, regret it again; more rumors come, we might still believe. In psychology, this is called psychological fragility," the retired teacher or cadre explained.

"Oh! Psychological fragility." The young man looked confused, holding the soy sauce bottle to report to his wife, shaking his head and muttering, "It seems there are still endless rumors and endless deceptions..."

　　关于谣言的街头对话
    陈一辛
    这是一个真实的故事，对话都是真实的，但是说不上人名，因为事情发生在街头。
    傍晚，在淮海西路一个街角围着一群人，议论着国家大事和当前复杂的形势。
    一位青年感慨地说：“现在真是听不完的谣言，上不完的当。”
    一位穿着花格衬衫的骑自行车的行人戛然停下，匆匆地问道：“啥事体？啥事体？”
    “啥事体？昨天下午‘高自联’大喇叭在街上广播说３８军起义了，与２７军打起来了，邓小平给气死了。”
    “真的？我早就想到了有这么一天。”穿花格衬衫的行人喜形于色地说。
    “你早想到！他妈的，是谣言！”那位青年气愤地说。
    那位行人也愤愤然地说：“怎么会是谣言？人家大学生消息灵通，连部队番号都知道，还会有假？”
    “你看过昨晚电视新闻没有？”一位插话道。
    “……”
    一位工人模样的中年人说：“中央电视台已经正式辟谣了。”
    “哪个赤佬下作，造这种缺德谣？”不知谁咕噜了一句。
    一位戴眼镜的青年：“我收听了台湾电台的广播，是他们广播这个消息的。”
    “真是上当！”第一位青年感慨地摇了摇头。
    “上当何止这一回？”一位戴副老花镜的退休教师或干部的人，放下手中的晚报转过身来参加了谈话：“北京学生绝食，大家都很忧虑，忽然传来死了３个同学，有名有姓，大家都感到十分悲伤，有的手脚快的赶快戴着黑纱、抬着花圈游行，结果上了大当。后来，又说两位老帅反对中央决定，我想大概有可能，我们年纪大的人总想求个太平，反对激烈行动，可隔了两天，两位老帅讲了话，在报上公布了。这个谣言破了。又说邓颖超怎么怎么，这回我就留点心眼了，周总理、邓大姐都是遵守纪律的模范，决不会反对中央，果然不错，第二天报上登了邓颖超的信，原来又是一个谣言。”
    “还有说几十位人大常委联名要求罢免李鹏。我们弄堂里几个山上下来的都已买了爆仗准备庆祝胜利呢！现在一些常委声明根本没有签字，一些常委说是签名要求开常委会讨论局势，可香港一家报纸登的信却加上罢免李鹏，我在一个朋友那里看到香港这家报纸已经对此表示歉意了。”一位老先生说。
    “都是一些港台报纸、电台造的谣，过去我们老百姓也看不到听不到不知道，这回我总算领教了资本主义新闻自由的味道了，”那位中年工人说。
    “这话不能这么说，人家‘美国之音’可是很客观公正的。”那位花格衬衫的行人反驳道：“它说真的就是真的，靠不住的消息它也老老实实说这是未经证实的消息，这个消息还有待进一步证实。”
    “这是造谣造得更巧妙。”那位中年工人也不相让。“传谣言的时候，加上一个未经证实的消息的话，结果谣言就变成新闻了。既然未经证实，你报道什么，不是存心害人吗？”
    “太复杂了，真是听不完的谣言，上不完的当，唉！”第一位青年再一次感叹地说。
    话未说完，一位女工，显然是位青年的妻子拿着瓶子从路边屋里跑出来，嚷道：“酱油没有了，快去打半公斤，等着烧菜用，快点，下了班不干事就站在马路上胡扯蛋。”
    “哎——这位大姐，话不能这么说，我们是关心国家大事。”那位穿花格衬衫的青年马上讨好地搭腔道。
    “什么关心国家大事？都是你们这帮男人偷懒的办法。国家大事，阿拉小百姓懂个屁，你知道情况吗？一个厂里的事阿拉还搞不灵清，全国情况你们搞得清？”显然这位女工是位能干泼辣的女性，说起话来又快又干净利落。
    “我们这不是在交流情况嘛”，她的丈夫似乎有些惧内，可一下子在这么多人面前下不来台，勉强地争辩着。
    “噢！就靠你们这样马路新闻，就能交流情况决定国家大事了，那市长、总理都让你们当去。”
    “这位大姐，我们是马路新闻，可人家‘美国之音’总是正式新闻吧。”那位穿着花格衬衫的青年颇为自负地扬了扬头。
    “中国人不听自己政府话，听‘美国之音’，外国人给你工资，给你奖金，给你饭吃衣穿啦？我没有你那么多新闻，我只认一个理，把中国搞乱了，结果吃苦的还是我们中国老百姓。你还站在这里干什么？没有酱油，你菜要不要吃？”那位女工像连珠炮似地左右开弓。
    那位青工无声地拿过酱油瓶走了。那位花格衬衫青年一边说着：“大姐可别乱戴帽子”，一边赶快推着自行车走了，一边还低声咕噜着：“阶级斗争为纲的余毒太深了。”
    那位女工也没有再理会，回到屋里烧饭去了。留下的人静场了一会，又继续了方才的谈话。
    “谣言多也怪我们的报纸、电台、电视里消息太少。北京发生反革命暴乱，你看满街贴着港台报纸说是‘黑色的６月３日’，天安门血流成河。可我们没有一篇详细报道，没有发一张照片，你叫老百姓相信谁？正道不通，自然小道泛滥……”中年工人不满地说。
    “是这个理，都快一个星期了，才由袁木在电视上讲在天安门戒严部队是同意学生和平撤退，根本没有发生什么冲突。全部死亡人数是３００人。平息一场暴乱死３００有什么不可以公布的，苏联火车站爆炸还死几百人呢！”那位戴眼镜的青年也愤愤地附和道。“真不知道我们中央那些宣传部门干什么去了？”
    “话也不能那么说。”那位退休教师或干部说：“你想造谣只要嘴一张就行了，当然快，也不负责的。可要公布事实真相，要辟谣，总要花一点时间调查核实吧，当然就要慢点了。”
    “这话也在理，可是也太慢了，这是新闻传播，又不是中央文件，要那么句句推敲干什么？等你推敲好了老百姓恐怕早就跟着谣言跑了。”
    “是啊，人总有先入为主的心理，信了谣言，一时还不信你那真相呢！谣言没有作用，人家造谣干什么？”
    那位青年买了酱油回来，正听到这句，忍不住又停住脚步说：“嗨——真的，你说，那些人造谣被辟了，为什么还要一而再造谣？”
    “中央不是说这是一场政治斗争嘛？”
    “那为什么一再上当，还有人信谣传谣呢？”
    “嗨，给自己壮胆嘛！”
    “别瞎讲，闹事的人或许要壮胆，我壮什么胆？”那位青年不满地说。
    “我们都是心地善良的老百姓，信了谣，上当，懊悔；新的谣言来了，又信，又上当，又懊悔；再来谣言，可能还信，这在心理学上叫做心理脆弱。”那位退休教师或干部解释说。
    “噢！心理脆弱。”那位青年茫然地拿着酱油瓶去向夫人交差去了，一边摇着头喃喃着：“看来还是听不完的谣言，上不完的当……”
