The "Huaihai Campaign" of Afforestation

When the term "Huaihai Campaign" is mentioned, some people might think it only refers to events that occurred during the "Great Leap Forward." However, this is not the case. Last winter and this spring, Guangdong launched a massive "Huaihai Campaign" to eliminate barren hills suitable for afforestation. The entire province had thousands of people participating in tree planting and afforestation every day. In just one city, Heyuan, the amount of earth and stones moved for land preparation and pit digging could build a one-meter-high, one-meter-wide dirt road from Guangzhou to Beijing and back.

This "Huaihai Campaign" achieved remarkable results. The province's 15 million mu of barren hills suitable for afforestation were reduced by over 12 million mu, with most counties (cities) planting trees on their barren hills, except for a few places. This shows that for major undertakings like tree planting and land greening, it is necessary and feasible to organize one or several "Huaihai Campaigns" within a certain scope.

In 1985, Guangdong still had 50 million mu of barren hills suitable for afforestation. In less than four years, this number was reduced to less than 3 million mu. The people who created this miracle are the broad masses of the people, while the provincial, municipal, and county-level cadres are the organizers of this great campaign. Planting trees is like fighting a battle, with clear responsibilities and strict discipline. No one is exempt. A county party secretary was given a "yellow card" warning and removed from his post for not achieving the afforestation target within his term. This incident shocked the entire province, known as the "yellow card effect." The "yellow card" warning took effect at all levels, from cadres to the masses, who all regarded afforestation as a duty that must be fulfilled. If a household did not afforest their "two mountains" (private mountain, responsibility mountain) within three years, the collective would unceremoniously take back the "two mountains" and reallocate them. This spring, the author went to Guangdong for an interview and deeply felt the power of the responsibility system, witnessing the moving scene of the masses eagerly afforesting and protecting the forests.

Today's "Huaihai Campaign" is very different from the "Huaihai Campaign" of the 1950s and 1960s. Back then, many places also organized "ten thousand people up the mountain" campaigns, which were once lively and noisy, with drums and gongs. However, trees were planted year after year without seeing forests, and the afforestation survival rate was extremely low. Why? The main reason is that afforestation was not combined with the farmers' immediate interests. Planting trees was also a matter of "eating from the same big pot," so how could the farmers be enthusiastic? Although the farmers went up the mountain, their hearts were not on planting trees, and they did not put in their full effort. They just went through the motions, even destroying as they planted, wasting both manpower and resources. Now, farmers plant trees not only for the country but also for themselves, so their enthusiasm is naturally high.

Currently, in some places, some farmers still do not plant trees after receiving their "two mountains." They are not unwilling to plant trees but are waiting to see what others do, fearing that they will be at a disadvantage if they plant trees first and others become envious. They hope for a good "atmosphere" for afforestation. To this end, on the one hand, we must further implement various forestry policies and make great efforts to stop the evil trend of indiscriminate felling; on the other hand, we can learn from Guangdong's experience and strengthen the organization and leadership of afforestation in a justified manner, including mobilizing the masses to launch a few "campaigns" after careful planning and demonstration, to promote the early formation of a national tree-planting "atmosphere."

### 造林的“淮海战役”

　　造林的“淮海战役”
    万兴
    建设年代提出打“淮海战役”，有人也许会以为这只能是发生在“大跃进”时的事。其实不然，广东于去冬今春为消灭宜林荒山就打了一场声势浩大的“淮海战役”，全省每天有上千万人参加植树造林，仅一个河源市整地打穴搬动的土石，就可以筑起一道一米高、一米宽的从广州至北京、又从北京至广州的泥土路（摘自五月七日《南方日报》第一版）。
    此次“淮海战役”可谓战果赫赫，全省一千五百万亩宜林荒山一下子消灭了一千二百多万亩，除少数地方外，大部分县（市）的宜林荒山都种上了树。这说明，类似植树造林、绿化大地这样艰巨的事业，在一定范围内适当组织一次、几次“淮海战役”是必要的，可行的。
    广东一九八五年尚有宜林荒山五千万亩，不到四年时间就减少到不足三百万亩。创造这一奇迹的是广大人民群众，而省、地（市）、县各级干部则是这场伟大战役的组织者。种树就像打仗一样，责任清楚，纪律严明，谁也不能例外。一个县委书记因没有达到任期内植树造林的目标而被“黄牌”警告后撤了职，这件事曾震动全省，这就是家喻户晓的“黄牌效应”。“黄牌”警告逐级生效，从干部到群众，都把植树造林当成必尽的义务。如果农户在划给他的“两山”（自留山、责任山）上三年不造林，集体就毫不客气地收回“两山”，另行承包。今年春天，笔者到广东采访，深深感到了责任制的力量，亲眼看到广大人民群众争着造林护林的动人情景。
    今天的“淮海战役”与五六十年代的“淮海战役”有很大的不同。那时不少地方也组织过“万人上山”，一时轰轰烈烈，锣鼓喧天，可年年植树不见林，造林保存率极低。什么原因？最主要的是没有把植树造林与农民的切身利益结合起来，种树也吃“大锅饭”，农民哪会有积极性？尽管农民人上了山，心却没有放在种树上，劲也不肯真使，凑合应付，甚至边造边毁，劳民而伤财。如今，农民种树既是为了国家，也是为了个人，劲头儿自然很足。
    目前，在一些地方，有些农民分了“两山”后仍不种树。他们并非不想种树，而是在互相观望，担心自己先种了，别人眼红，种树反而吃亏。他们盼望造林有个好的“大气候”。为此，一方面要进一步落实各项林业政策，下大力气刹住乱砍滥伐歪风；另一方面，则可以借鉴广东的经验，理直气壮地加强对植树造林的组织领导，包括经过精心论证规划后动员群众打几次“战役”，促进全民植树的“大气候”早日形成。
