A Banquet Causing Concern
– A Record of Shuling Village Cadres Squandering Public Funds on Feasting

Shuling Village in Qianchang Town of our county has 11 teams, 403 households, 1,733 people, and 4,690 mu of arable land. It produces 3,029 tons of grain annually, with a per capita net income of 591 yuan. Last year, the 11 village cadres collectively feasted 1,144 times, averaging 104 meals per person, spending 35,069.86 yuan on feasting, which is 3,188.17 yuan per person. Of this amount, 7,889.46 yuan was spent on feasting under the pretext of entertaining guests, while 27,080.40 yuan was spent on feasting without any guests. Additionally, the 11 village teams had another 15,100 yuan in feasting expenses. The total feasting expenses of the village and team cadres amounted to over 50,000 yuan. The per capita burden of the village's farmers for the cadres' feasting expenses is 28.95 yuan.

A Special Village Rule

In March 1987, Shuling Village established a special "village rule and regulation," specifying the amount of public funds each cadre could spend on feasting annually. According to this rule, the village party branch secretary Pan Xingbin, deputy secretary Zeng Huotang, village committee director Fu Shixiong, and accountant Zeng Gaochao could each spend 600 yuan; the two deputy directors of the village committee could each spend 500 yuan; the director of the women's committee could spend 400 yuan; the deputy director of the women's committee, the youth league branch secretary, the cashier, and the accountant could each spend 300 yuan. The 11 cadres could collectively spend 5,000 yuan annually. However, during banquets, the 5,000 yuan limit was long forgotten.

Shocking Feasting

In Shuling Village, there are two "cadres' restaurants" in the village office. In 1988, the village cadres feasted 710 times in these two restaurants alone, spending over 28,000 yuan.

Their feasting methods are diverse, mainly manifested in four aspects: First, they feast extravagantly when going out on business. On September 15, 1987, the village party branch secretary Pan Xingbin, deputy director Zeng Zhaonian, and accountant Zeng Gaochao went out on business. They dined at a restaurant, drinking from 7 PM until midnight, spending 180 yuan. The three of them were so drunk that they had to hire a tractor to take them home.

Second, they feast when guests come. On January 9 last year, an official from the town land management office came to the village for an inspection. The village sent 9 cadres to accompany him, spending 85.70 yuan on one meal.

Third, they use meetings and festivals as excuses to feast. In this village, almost every meeting involves feasting, and every festival involves a banquet. On February 11 last year, the village held a summary meeting. The cadres, under the pretext of comforting revolutionary martyrs' families and five-guarantee households, set up 6 banquet tables, spending 503.90 yuan in one go. In reality, they only sent 24 kilograms of pork to 6 five-guarantee households.

Fourth, they compete with each other in feasting. The 11 cadres in Shuling Village are not willing to be outdone in feasting. The main leaders go out more often and feast outside, then submit the expenses upon returning. The ordinary cadres find various reasons to feast in the village restaurants. On May 13, 1988, the village director Fu Shixiong, under the pretext of arranging for fertilizer, submitted 358.41 yuan in living expenses for one day. The main leaders feast extravagantly, and the other cadres follow suit. On July 2, 10 out of the 11 cadres feasted in 8 different places, spending 332.89 yuan.

Chaotic Finances

How do the cadres in Shuling Village handle the financial procedures for squandering public funds? The village's reimbursement procedures are very simple. As long as a cadre signs on the dining receipt, the financial personnel do not ask for the reason for the feast, do not care about the amount spent, do not check the dining location, do not distinguish between genuine and fake receipts, do not require any approval, and reimburse everything. Every cadre manages and uses money, and everyone signs for reimbursement.

In 1988, the 11 cadres signed for reimbursement of 1,085 dining receipts. Among them, Pan Xingbin handled 107, totaling 4,511.26 yuan; the village director Fu Shixiong handled 158, totaling 7,561.16 yuan; the youth league branch secretary handled the least, with 32, totaling 782.96 yuan. Even more astonishing, among these reimbursement vouchers, 41 receipts totaling 856.87 yuan for feasting had no dining date or handler's signature, but all were successfully reimbursed. The accountant Zeng Gaochao forged 14 receipts, embezzling 1,048.25 yuan of public funds. The village director Fu Shixiong often had relatives and friends come to his home, and they would frequently take dishes from the "cadres' restaurant," with the public paying the bill.

Currently, Shuling Village is already heavily in debt. By the end of last year, Shuling Village owed a total of 126,000 yuan in internal and external debts.

Concerns from Exposure

The extravagant feasting of Shuling Village cadres has drawn the high attention of the county and town party organizations and governments. People can draw the following enlightenment from this:

First, it is necessary to build a clean and truly people-serving village-level party and government organization. The implementation of the party's policies, the connection between the party and the people, and the development of the rural economy ultimately depend on the village-level party and government organizations. Without a reliable and solid village-level party and government leadership team, the rural economy cannot develop, the four modernizations cannot be realized, and the cause of our party will become a bubble. The party committees at all levels must not take the construction of village-level party and government teams lightly.

Second, it is necessary to strengthen the financial management of rural areas. After the implementation of the household contract responsibility system, the financial management of some townships and villages is quite chaotic and full of loopholes. Relevant departments should take measures to improve the financial system and thoroughly change the chaotic situation of rural financial management.

Third, it is necessary to truly implement the work. The extravagant feasting of Shuling Village cadres is not something that can be formed in a day or two. However, since 1986, Qianchang Town has organized relevant personnel to clean up the village-level financial situation every year, and Shuling Village has smoothly passed the inspection every year. This shows that many tasks assigned by higher-level authorities have not been implemented, and many things have been deceived by seemingly reasonable reports.

Fourth, it is necessary to promptly rectify and regulate. The situation in Shuling Village tells us that regulating the economic environment and rectifying the economic order is a comprehensive and overall task. In rural areas, carrying out rectification and regulation is not only necessary but also has a lot to do.

### 令人忧思的宴席——舒岭村干部挥霍公款吃喝纪实

　　令人忧思的宴席   
    ——舒岭村干部挥霍公款吃喝纪实
    我县钱场镇舒岭村共有１１个组、４０３户、１７３３人、４６９０亩耕地，年产粮食３０２９吨，人均纯收入５９１元。去年１１个村干部累计吃喝１１４４顿，人均１０４餐，吃喝资金达３５０６９．８６元，人均３１８８．１７元。其中以招待来客为由的吃喝开支７８８９．４６元，无客自吃的２７０８０．４０元。此外，１１个个村民小组另有吃喝开支１５１００元。村、组干部两级吃喝开支共达５万多元。全村农民人均负担干部吃喝开支２８．９５元。
    　　　　特殊的村规
    １９８７年３月，舒岭村制订了一个特殊的“村规民约”，分别确定了每个村干部一年可“吃”公款的具体细目。其中，村党支部书记潘兴彬、副书记曾火堂、村委会主任付世雄、会计曾高潮等４人每人可吃６００元；两名村委会副主任每人可吃５００元；村妇委会主任可吃４００元；一名妇委会副主任、一名村团支部书记、一名出纳员、一名记帐员，每人可吃３００元；１１名村干部一年共计可吃５０００元。然而，到了酒席宴会上，５０００元的限额早抛到了九霄云外。
    　　　　惊人的吃喝
    在舒岭村村部，有两家“干部餐馆”。１９８８年，村干部仅在这两家餐馆吃喝就达７１０多顿，开支２８０００多元。
    他们吃喝的方式多种多样，突出表现在４个方面：一是外出办事大肆吃喝。１９８７年９月１５日，村支部书记潘兴彬，副主任曾照年、会计曾高潮外出联系工作。晚饭时，他们到一家餐馆喝酒，从晚上７点钟一直喝到午夜，共花资金１８０元。３人喝得烂醉如泥，只得花钱雇了一台拖拉机将他们送回家。
    二是来了客人陪着吃。去年１月９日，镇土地管理所一名干部到这个村里检查工作，村里派了９个干部作陪，一餐吃掉８５．７０元。
    三是开会过节借口吃。在这个村，几乎逢会必摆酒，逢节就会餐。去年２月１１日，村里召开总结会，村干部以慰问烈军属、五保户为名，摆了６桌酒席，一次就吃掉５０３．９０元。实际上，他们只给６户五保户送去了２４公斤猪肉。
    四是互相“竞赛”比着吃。舒岭村１１个村干部在吃喝上都不甘示弱。主要领导干部外出多一些，就在外面吃了回村报帐，而一般干部就借各种名目在村里的餐馆“赶本”。１９８８年５月１３日，村主任付世雄以联系化肥为名，一天就报销生活费３５８．４１元。主要领导干部大吃大喝，其它干部也竞相攀比。７月２日，１１名村干部就有１０人分８处进餐，耗资３３２．８９元。
    　　　　紊乱的财务
    舒岭村的干部大肆挥霍公款，他们是怎样履行财务手续的呢？这个村的报账手续很简单，在吃喝的发票单上，只要有村干部签字，财务人员就不问吃喝理由，不管耗资多少，不看进餐地方，不分发票真假，不要任何人审批，一概报销。村干部人人管钱用钱，个个签字报账。
    １９８８年，１１个村干部签字报账的吃喝发票共有１０８５张。其中，潘兴彬经手签字的有１０７张，４５１１．２６元；村主任付世雄经手签字的有１５８张，７５６１．１６元；签字最少的是团支部书记，也有３２张，７８２．９６元。更有甚者，这些报账单据中，有４１张发票，８５６．８７元的吃喝款，既没有进餐日期，也没有经手人签字，都顺利地入了帐。会计曾高潮开假发票１４张、骗取公款１０４８．２５元。村主任付世雄家里来了亲戚朋友，经常到“干部餐馆”端菜，最后由公家出钱。
    目前，舒岭村已负债累累。到去年底止，舒岭村共欠内外债１２．６万多元。
    　　　　“曝光”的忧思
    舒岭村干部大肆挥霍公款，已经引起了县、镇两级党组织和政府的高度重视。人们可以从中得到这样一些启示：
    一、必须建设一个廉洁的、真正为群众办事的村级党政组织。党的政策的贯彻落实，党与群众的联系，发展农村经济，最终都要通过村级党政组织才能实现，没有一个可靠的、坚实的村级党政领导班子，农村经济就不能发展，四化就难以实现，我们党的事业就会成为泡影。各级党委对村级党政班子建设切不可等闲视之。
    二、必须切实加强农村财务管理。农村实行联产承包责任制以后，一些乡村的财务管理十分混乱，漏洞不少。有关部门要采取措施，健全财务制度，彻底改变农村财务管理混乱的状况。
    三、必须真正把工作抓落实。舒岭村干部大吃大喝非一朝一夕所能形成的。然而，１９８６年以来，钱场镇每年都组织有关人员清理村级财务情况，舒岭村每年都顺利过关。这说明上级机关布置的许多工作并没有落到实处，许多事情都被一些冠冕堂皇的汇报蒙骗了。
    四、必须抓紧治理整顿。舒岭村的情况告诉我们，治理经济环境，整顿经济秩序是一个全方位、全局性的工作，在农村，开展治理整顿不仅十分必要，而且大有文章可做。
