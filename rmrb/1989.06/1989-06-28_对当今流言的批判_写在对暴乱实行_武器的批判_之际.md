**Criticism of Rumors Today**
**—Written at the Time of the Criticism of Weapons in the Suppression of the Riots**

Chen Tanqiang

Regardless of one's will, a storm of class struggle has emerged in today's China; it is imperative to consciously use "criticism of weapons" and "weapons of criticism."

The summer of 1989 in Beijing, where blood and fire wrote a memorable page in the history of the People's Republic of China.

Suppressing this counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing was a battle of justice over evil, of revolutionary violence against counter-revolutionary violence. It was a struggle where the People's Liberation Army, defending the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system of our country, defeated the reactionary forces that opposed the Communist Party and socialism.

In the struggle and choice between the People's Republic of China, as defined by the constitution, and the completely Westernized bourgeois republic that the enemy elements sought to establish, apart from the "criticism of weapons" that the armed forces of the people had to resort to, the civilian forces of the people must also not forget to take up the "weapons of criticism." This includes the need to conduct a criticism of today's rumors to achieve the correct guidance of public opinion through mass media.

It is a shocking fact: a small number of people who feared that today's People's China would not be chaotic, using a large number of young students who are inexperienced and biased, and borrowing the strength of some hooligans, actually occupied Tiananmen Square in the capital for more than a month. They manufactured and spread rumors nationwide from there. Tiananmen Square, where rumors were rife, became a festering sore on the body of the People's Republic, quickly causing unrest in some places across the country, especially in a number of large and medium-sized cities.

Now is the time to analyze and dissect, to see how rumors fully manifested their inherent attributes and distinctive features in this social turmoil that started in the capital and spread to some parts of the country.

Social turmoil is the breeding ground for rumors, and rumors are the hormones of social turmoil.

Rumors and social turmoil are inseparable. Whenever there is significant social turmoil, a sense of instability arises among the broad masses, and a large number of rumors emerge. Social turmoil is a serious disruption to the social organism, where the rational order established in society is disrupted by human forces, providing a suitable breeding ground for the emergence of irrational rumors. The more intense the social turmoil, the more it affects the interests of groups (classes, strata, groups, organizations) with the same tendencies and carries ambiguity, the more rumors in these groups become a way to express their will, a psychological projection, balancing the imbalanced psychology of the confused, to maintain this group.

The spread of each rumor is like injecting a dose of hormones, making groups with the same tendencies active in social turmoil.

In this turmoil and riot that occurred in Beijing, rumors kept emerging, adding fuel to the fire. The fact is that a group of students who illegally stormed the seat of the Central People's Government and blocked major traffic arteries were forcibly removed, but rumors spread that the law enforcement officers had arrested and beaten people, fabricating a so-called "April 20 massacre." Clearly, it was a traffic accident involving Bus Route 105, but rumors insisted that a police car had run over petitioning students. Such rumors, born of turmoil, also acted on the turmoil, merely to mislead people and incite more unaware individuals to join the turmoil. Rumors that the People's Liberation Army's martial law troops entering Beijing were there to suppress students and common people, as well as other such rumors, confused and captured the temporarily unaware masses, further mobilizing and gathering a number of rioters and criminals, showing how malicious the role of rumors was in the process of the turmoil developing into a riot!

Rumors, this man-made, expanding social phenomenon, are full of variability in their spread and expansion, and their lack of accuracy has an inherent basis.

A large number of facts prove that those with malicious intentions deliberately lied, fabricated lies, and created rumors. They claimed to be "mobilizing the masses," knowing that a student from Beijing Normal University had died in a traffic accident, they still lied and said he was run over by a police car. For this "need to mobilize the masses," which was essentially a plot to overthrow the legitimate government of the People's Republic of China, they even fabricated rumors such as "the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of China has announced its withdrawal from the central government," "more than 30 countries internationally have announced non-recognition of the Chinese government," and so on.

It should also be noted that even some well-meaning, kind-hearted people, in times of intense social turmoil, cannot help but spread hearsay, randomly capture information, and the rumors become more and more mysterious as they spread from one person to ten, and from ten to a hundred.

Generally speaking, the internal mechanism of rumors is memory. Those who spread rumors rely on memory to pass on the information they receive to others, but memory itself is often inaccurate. Scholars' experimental research on memory has proven: the impression or description of a certain thing or process is not the prototype, the impression or description can be "infinite close" to the prototype, but cannot be completely identical. The content of memory, after being spread and reproduced by several people, is often distorted and varied, and may eventually become unrecognizable. This is from the perspective of psychological science, explaining the lack of accuracy in lies.

From the perspective of cognition, the social nature of the cognitive subject necessarily makes the spreader of rumors, in the process of spreading, play a role in emphasizing and evaluating the rumors, easily making the content of the rumors subjective and arbitrary, leading to the rumors becoming less accurate the more they are spread.

In this turmoil and riot that occurred in Beijing, as well as the turmoil and unrest in a number of large and medium-sized cities, are there not many rumors that originated from the same source but developed into different "versions"?

Not a single student who went on a hunger strike in Tiananmen Square died, and the rumors about dying from hunger strikes were all lies. However, the rumors spread to a certain large city, claiming that there was a "female hero" named Huang, and to a certain medium-sized city, claiming that there were "16 brave martyrs." Looking at the way people wore black armbands and offered wreaths for the so-called deceased "heroes" and "martyrs," one truly feels how pitiful and sad these people are. After feeling sad, one also feels angry, isn't this misleading the masses and fanning the flames of turmoil?

The rumor of the "massacre at Tiananmen" spread to Yinchuan City, where more than 4,000 university students took to the streets, holding a memorial march for the supposed "deceased" three local university students. The irony is that these three university students, except for one who stayed in Beijing, returned to school within two days. Such "death and resurrection," couldn't this make the kind-hearted, well-meaning people who participated in the farce of mourning the living learn a lesson and be wary of being misled by rumors in the future?

Rumors harm people; when combined with reactionary ideologies and conspiratorial activities, they can become a destructive force of enormous magnitude.

Groups with the same tendencies, driven by immediate, personal interests, often spread lies that are exclusive, with their sharp edges directed at groups and individuals with opposite tendencies. Especially, in a group, the representative individual or several individuals, i.e., the person or several leaders with outstanding social status and role performance, are most likely to be the target of rumors during social turmoil.

This intense social turmoil that started in the capital and spread to several cities across the country is the result of the rampant bourgeois liberalization trend in recent years. It is the result of a few leading figures who have been making waves for a long time, plotting to overthrow the Communist Party and the socialist system. The deep-seated essence of various harmful rumors is their spread of heresy; conversely, the surface projection of their spread of heresy is various harmful rumors.

As the chief architect of China's reform and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping first proposed and consistently adhered to the four cardinal principles as the foundation of the state and the path to national strength: adhering to the socialist road, adhering to the people's democratic dictatorship, adhering to the leadership of the Communist Party, and adhering to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. He clearly opposed this social turmoil that began in April, and decisively and resolutely took measures to suppress the counter-revolutionary riot brewing from the turmoil, thereby attracting all kinds of bizarre and vicious rumors.

The ancient Chinese philosopher Xunzi said: "All rumors, sayings, actions, plots, praises, and accusations that do not go through official channels but come from the side, the gentleman should be cautious about them." Translated into modern Chinese, this means: "All false rumors, sayings, plots, schemes, flattery, and slander that do not go through proper channels but come from the side, good people should be cautious about them." The harsh reality not only perfectly annotates this ancient experience, but also makes one appreciate the new features of the contemporary era.

In this turmoil and riot that occurred in Beijing, a small number of people, either behind the scenes or in the front lines, worked hard to manufacture and spread rumors, combining rumors with sayings (fallacies of the bourgeois liberalization trend), actions (various illegal activities), plots (plots to create turmoil and riots), praises ("democracy fighters," "political elites," etc., self-flattery), and accusations (slandering and defaming recognized party leaders and legal government heads). In this process of mutual use and infiltration, various exclusive rumors are transformed into a material force with enormous destructive power.

Even Xunzi of ancient times understood that "words that harm people are deeper than spears and halberds," can't contemporary people wake up from the lessons of reality?

Rumors are constrained by the duration and spatial range of social turmoil, and their frequency and spatial scope of transmission are determined by their alignment or opposition to modern mass media.

Rumors are originally small talk and street news, but once they are connected to mass media using modern technology, their spread and timeliness are not to be underestimated, especially the use of electronic technology makes rumors easily cross borders in an instant.

In this social turmoil that spread from Beijing to several cities across the country, when rumors were rampant, whether it was our country's media or foreign media, whether it was print media or electronic media, most of them inevitably took different attitudes and evaluations based on their different positions, actively exerting different influences; of course, there were a few who remained neutral, observing the situation, and did not comment, but they were few in number.

Those who gave positive evaluations aligned with the rumors, using modern technology to spread them, actively acting on the rumors, making them rise to a higher level of public opinion form, enhancing the positive effect of the rumors. Those who gave negative evaluations opposed the rumors, using modern technology to create a public opinion to suppress the rumors, forming another active effect on the rumors, producing the negative effect of the rumors.

Look at the treatment of the "massacre at Tiananmen" rumor, in our country's media, the *People's Liberation Army Daily*, *Beijing Daily*, and CCTV, China National Radio, Xinhua News Agency, etc., clearly refuted it, and even in the reports, they quoted the figures that the State Council spokesman Yuan Mu had at that time to clarify the facts: on the morning of June 3, after the riot occurred, more than 5,000 soldiers of the People's Liberation Army were injured, 2,000 people in the local area (including lawless rioters and onlookers who did not understand the truth) were injured, nearly 300 people in the military and local areas died, and no one died in the cleanup process in Tiananmen Square. There were no tanks or military vehicles running over people, all of which were to correct public opinion and distinguish truth from falsehood; while some newspapers in Hong Kong blatantly and tirelessly put "massacre at Tiananmen" on the front page to fulfill their wishes and incite readers. As for international public opinion, there were even more who were not willing to fall behind. According to a report from the *World Journal* in New York on June 5, the so-called "massacre at Tiananmen" death and injury figures spread by Western media at that time were already all over the place, among which the American National Broadcasting Network said 1,400 people died and 10,000 were injured, the American Broadcasting Company said 2,000 people died, the Associated Press said at least 500 people died, the British Broadcasting Corporation said 2,000 people died and more than 10,000 were injured, Reuters said more than 1,000 people died, Agence France-Presse said at least 1,400 people died and 10,000 were injured. In short, they fabricated out of thin air, not caring that their numbers contradicted each other, they still wanted to spread it to the world and defame China.

"Voice of America" has been particularly prominent recently, playing a particularly unseemly role in the turmoil and riot that occurred in China and Beijing. It treats street news and square rumors as treasures, using several shortwave radio frequencies to widely spread them in the form of seemingly objective reports such as "an eyewitness said" and "according to reliable sources," poisoning international public opinion and confusing the vision of the world. It can be called the number one "rumor company," acting as both a broker and a workshop, chattering all day. So many rumors flying around, ordinary people can't help but find it difficult to distinguish which ones are its current purchases and sales, and which ones are simply its own production and sales.

From this, one can see how domestic and foreign reactionary forces communicate with each other, and further, from one side, see the internal connection between China's storms and the international climate. This cannot but make the Chinese people wary of Dulles, who, though dead, is not forgotten, and his strategy of plotting to break the "fortress from within" through the Cold War to gradually transform socialist countries is now being worshipped by someone. This must be firmly resisted and exposed. Let's see how this countercurrent ebbs and flows!

The criticism of today's rumors should go beyond general social psychology: it cannot be just a political struggle in reality, a real political struggle.

In the literature of social psychology, rumors, hearsay, and gossip are usually discussed as a special manifestation of mass psychology, placed in chapters such as "collective psychology." Of course, there are also those who have written books as a specialized research object, such as the book *Psychology of Rumors* by Chen Xueping, a Chinese scholar, published by the Commercial Press in the 1930s, and in the 1940s, American social psychologists C.W. Allport and Postman also wrote the book *The Psychology of Rumors*. Seeking advice from scholars is not without benefit, but there is no need to insist that people bury themselves in piles of old papers.

However, from a deeper analysis of the suppression of the turmoil and riot in Beijing, reading this real political struggle textbook, and linking it to reality to conduct a criticism of rumors, the benefits will definitely be greater, and it is a necessary lesson. It can vividly educate us on how to strike a small number of enemy elements, how to unite the masses, how to make kind-hearted, well-meaning people wake up, and how to make our basic forces even stronger.

"Flattering words and falsehoods are universally hated." Only by doing a good job of criticizing rumors can we truly seek the consensus and hatred of the masses.

"Rumors stop at the wise." By doing a good job of criticizing rumors, again and again, we become wiser, continuously expanding the ranks of the wise, and thus shrinking the market for rumors. Do not spread rumors, do not believe rumors, and I wish to strive together with the readers.

　　对当今流言的批判    
    ——写在对暴乱实行“武器的批判”之际
    陈谈强
    不以人的意志为转移，一场阶级斗争的急风骤雨出现在今日中国；
    而自觉运用“武器的批判”和“批判的武器”，则是势在必行的。
    １９８９年北京之夏，那血与火写就了中华人民共和国历史上可歌可泣的一页。
    平息这场发生在北京的反革命暴乱，是一场正义压倒邪恶、革命暴力反击反革命暴力的战斗，是捍卫中国共产党的领导、捍卫我国社会主义制度的人民子弟兵战胜反对共产党、反对社会主义的反动势力的斗争。
    在这关乎宪法既定国体的中华人民共和国和敌对分子企求建立的完全西方化的资产阶级共和国这样两种命运的较量与选择中，除了人民的武装部队不得已而为之的“武器的批判”，人民的文装队伍还切切不可忘却拿起“批判的武器”，其中包括为了实现大众传播媒介正确的舆论导向，而需要进行对当今流言的批判。
    这是令人惊骇不已的铁的事实：唯恐今日人民中国天下不乱的极少数人，利用涉世不深、激愤偏颇的大批青年学生，再借用一些痞子流氓的力量，竟然占据首都天安门广场一月有余，他们在这里制造流言推广到全国。流言沸沸扬扬的天安门广场，一时成了人民共和国肌体上一块发炎的溃疡，迅即引起全国一些地方、特别是一批大中城市跟着动乱发烧。
    现在该是条分缕析的时候了，看看在这次发轫于首都而扩展到全国一些地方的社会动荡中，流言是怎样充分表现出固有的属性和鲜明的特色的吧。
    社会动荡是流言的温床，流言是社会动荡的激素。
    流言和社会动荡密不可分，每当发生大的社会动荡，在广大社会成员中会产生不安定感，大量的流言便应运而生。社会动荡是社会有机体遭到严重干扰，社会既定的有理性的秩序遇到人为力量的破坏，这就为萌生非理性的流言提供了适宜的温床。社会动荡越是剧烈，越是触及其成员具有同一倾向的群体（阶级、阶层、集团、组织）的利害关系并又带有模糊性的时候，在这个群体中的流言，便成了他们表达意愿的一种方式，成了一种心理投射，使盲然无措的失衡的心理得到某种心理的平衡，以维系这一群体。
    一个个流言的传播，好比注入一剂剂激素，使其成员具有同一倾向的群体在社会动荡之中处于活跃的状态。
    在这次北京发生的动乱、暴乱中，流言不时迭起，一阵阵火上加油。事实是违法冲击中央人民政府所在地、阻塞交通要道的一批学生被强制送走，流言却风传执法人员抓人打人，生造出一个什么“４·２０惨案”；明明是１０５路电车发生行车事故，流言硬说警车轧死请愿学生。如此等等流言，既生之于动乱，又作用于动乱，无非是蛊惑人心，挑动更多不明真相的人裹入动乱。而把中国人民解放军戒严部队开进北京城，硬说是来镇压学生和老百姓的流言，以及其他种种流言，则把一时不明真相的群众迷惑俘虏，更把一些暴徒歹徒动员起来、聚集起来，足见流言在动乱发展成为暴乱的过程中的作用是何等恶劣！
    流言这种人为的、扩张性的社会现象，在其传播扩张过程中富有变异性，它的不确切性有着必然的内在根据。
    大量事实证明，那些居心不良的人，硬是睁眼说瞎话，捏造谎言，制造流言。他们声称为了“动员群众的需要”，明知北京师范大学那位学生不幸死于交通事故，也要撒谎说是警车轧死的。为了这个“动员群众的需要”，实质上是图谋颠覆中华人民共和国合法政府的需要，甚至编织出“中国外交部已宣布脱离中央政府”、“国际上已有３０多个国家宣布不承认中国政府”等等流言。
    还应看到，即如某些善良、好心的人们，在社会动荡剧烈之时，也不免道听途说，胡乱捕捉信息，一传十，十传百，流言内容越传越玄乎。
    一般地说，流言的内部机制是记忆，传播流言者凭记忆把得到的消息转给别人，而记忆本身多有误差。学者们有关记忆的实验研究证明：记忆某一事物的印象或某一过程的描述并不是原型，印象或描述同原型之间可以“无限接近”，但是不能完全等同，记忆内容经过若干人的传播再现，走样变异是常见的，甚至最终可能面目全非。这是从心理科学的角度，讲谎言的不确切性。
    而从认识上讲，认识主体的社会性，必然使得流言传播者在传播过程中对流言起加重和评价的作用，容易使流言内容带有主观随意性，导致流言越传越不确切。
    在这次北京发生的动乱、暴乱以及一批大中城市发生的动乱、骚乱中，同一发源而衍生出不同“版本”的流言还少吗？
    在天安门广场绝食的学生无一死亡，那关于绝食至死的流言完全是弥天大谎。可是，流言传到某大城市竟有板有眼地说是出了一个“女英烈”叫黄某某的，而传到某中等城市则冒出了什么“壮烈牺牲１６勇士”。看看为所谓死难“英烈”、“勇士”戴黑纱、献花圈的那等模样，真叫人感到彼等众生是何等可悲可怜。而悲怜之后又令人感到可恼，这不是流言惑众、为动乱推波助澜吗？
    所谓“血洗天安门”的流言传到银川市，竟有４０００多大学生上街，指名道姓地为所谓“死难”的３名当地大学生举行追悼游行。具有极大讽刺意味的是，这三名大学生，除一人滞留北京家中，另外两人两天之内先后返校。如此“死而复生”，还不能使参加追悼未亡人闹剧的善良、好心的人们从中得到教益，警惕今后不为流言所惑吗？
    流言伤人，它同反动思潮、阴谋活动相结合，可以成为增量极大的破坏力。
    成员具有同一倾向的群体在眼前的、切身的利益驱动下，其组成个体之间传播的谎言，内容往往具有排他性，锋芒所向往往是具有另一倾向的群体及其组成的个体。特别是，那群体中具有代表性的某一个体或若干个体，即社会地位和角色表现超群的某一个人或若干领袖人物，在发生社会动荡之时，最容易招致流言。
    这次始于首都而波及全国若干个城市的剧烈的社会动荡，是近几年中资产阶级自由化思潮泛滥的结果，是极少数坚持打倒共产党、推翻社会主义制度的头面人物，在相当长的时期里翻云覆雨制造一定气候的结果。种种伤人流言的深层底蕴，就是他们散布的异端邪说；反过来说，他们散布的异端邪说的表层投射，就是种种伤人的流言。
    作为当代我国改革开放总设计师的邓小平同志，首先提出并一贯坚持立国之本、强国之路的四项基本原则，即坚持社会主义道路，坚持人民民主专政，坚持共产党的领导，坚持马列主义、毛泽东思想，旗帜鲜明地反对这次起于４月的社会动乱，坚决果断地采取平息由动乱而酿成的反革命暴乱，因而招致的流言百般离奇和凶狠。
    中国古代思想家荀子有言：凡流言、流说、流事、流谋、流誉、流诉，不官而衡至者，君子慎之。把这段话译成现代汉语就是：凡是虚妄的谣言、论说、谋事、筹划、溢美、谗毁，不走正道却横逆而来，善良的人们就要谨慎对待。严酷的现实，不仅正好注释了古已有之的这个经验之谈，而且使人领略到当代的新特色。
    在这次北京发生的动乱、暴乱中，极少数人或幕后策划，或赤膊上阵，他们竭力制造和传播流言，把流言同流说（资产阶级自由化思潮的谬说）、流事（种种违法活动）、流谋（制造动乱、暴乱的阴谋）、流誉（“民主斗士”、“政治精英”等自我溢美）、流诉（诽谤诋毁公认的党的领袖和合法的政府首脑）结合起来。在这种交相为用、互相渗透的过程中，各种排他性的流言就转化为具有巨大破坏作用的物质力量。
    古之荀子尚且懂得“伤人之言，深于矛戟”，今人难道还不能从现实的教训中警醒吗？
    流言受着社会动荡延续时间和范围空间的制约，它传播的时间频率和空间跨度，则以其同现代化大众传播媒介相向结合或背向排斥为转移。
    流言本是小道消息、马路新闻，但它一旦同采用现代化技术的大众传播媒介发生联系，那传播之广、时效之速，就不可小看，特别是电子技术的运用使流言极易瞬间跨越国界。
    在这次从北京到全国若干个城市的社会动荡中，当流言频传之时，无论是我国传播媒介还是外国的传播媒介，也无论是印刷传播媒介还是电子传播媒介，大多势必依自己不同的立场而取不同的态度、不同的评价，积极施加不同的影响；当然，一时超然，以静观动，不予置评，消极对待者有之，但为数不多。
    肯定评价者，同流言相向结合，运用现代化技术手段加以扩散，积极作用于流言，使之上升为高一层次的舆论形式，加重流言的正效应。否定评价者，同流言背向排斥，通过现代化技术手段制造一种舆论压制流言，形成另一种积极作用于流言的后果，产生流言的负效应。
    试看对待“血洗天安门”的流言，国人的传播媒介中，《解放军报》、《北京日报》和中央电视台、中央人民广播电台、新华通讯社等旗帜鲜明地予以驳斥，早在报道中就援引国务院发言人袁木６月６日当时已掌握的数字说明事实真相：６月３日凌晨暴乱发生后，解放军官兵伤５０００多人、地方上（包括为非作歹的暴徒、围观的不明真相的群众）２０００人、军队和地方死亡近３００人，而在天安门广场清理过程中无一死亡，没有坦克、军车轧伤人，这都是为了端正视听，明辨真伪；而香港一些报纸竟堂而皇之、不厌其烦地把“血洗天安门”捧上头版，以遂其心志，煽惑读者。至于国际舆论中更有不甘落后者，据纽约《世界日报》６月５日一则消息报道，西方传播媒介到那时散布的所谓“血洗天安门”的死伤数字就已五花八门，其中美国全国电视广播网说１４００人死亡、１万人受伤，美国广播公司说２０００人死亡，美联社说至少５００人死亡，英国广播公司说２０００人死亡，上万人受伤，路透社说超过１０００人死亡，法新社说至少１４００人死亡、１万人受伤。总之，它们无中生有，哪管它们的数字互相打架，也要推向世界、诋毁中国。
    “美国之音”近来表现尤为突出，在中国、在北京发生的动乱、暴乱中，扮演了一个特别不光彩的角色。它把马路新闻、广场流言当珍奇宝贝，通过“一个目击者说”、“据可靠人士称”等貌似客观的报道形式，用好几个无线电短波频道广为传播，毒化国际舆论，混淆世人视听。它可称得上不可一世的头号“造谣公司”，既当掮客、又开作坊、成天价喋喋不休。那样多流言飞传，常人不免难于分清哪些是它现趸现卖的，哪些简直就是它自产自销的。
    由此可以看清国内外反动势力是怎样互通声息的，进而从一个侧面看到中国风风雨雨同国际大气候之间的内在联系。这不能不使中国人民警惕杜勒斯虽死不僵，他那图谋通过冷战使“堡垒从内部攻破”，实现社会主义国家逐渐蜕变的战略，如今又有人顶礼膜拜。对此，必须坚决顶住，加以揭露。且看这逆流如何消长！
    对当今流言的批判，理当超越一般社会心理学：它不能不是走出书斋的政治斗争的现实、现实的政治斗争。
    在社会心理学的论著中，通常是把流言、传闻、谣言等集合现象，作为大众心理的一种特殊表现形式，放在“集合心理”一类的篇章里来阐述。当然，也有以此作为专门研究对象著书立说的，本世纪３０年代商务印书馆就出版了我国学者陈雪屏的专著《谣言心理学》，而在４０年代美国社会心理学家Ｃ.Ｗ.奥斯波特和波斯特曼还写了《蛊惑心理学》一书。向学者们求教不无益处，却大可不必强求人们埋头于故纸堆。
    但是，从深层剖析平息北京这场动乱、暴乱，捧读这现实政治斗争的活的教科书，联系实际进行对流言的批判，裨益必定更大，是很有必要的一课。它可以生动地教育我们，怎样打击极少数敌对分子，怎样团结人民大众，怎样使善良、好心的人们警觉起来，怎样使自己基本队伍更加坚强。
    “利口伪言，众所共恶。”只有做好对流言的批判，才能真正求得人民大众的共识、共恶。
    “流丸止于瓯臾，流言止于智者。”做好对流言的批判、再批判，使我们更加聪明起来，不断补大智者的队伍，便可缩小流言的市场。不传播流言，不听信流言，愿与读者共勉。　　　　　　　　　（原载６月２６日《经济参考》）
