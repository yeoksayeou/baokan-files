East Germany Highly Values Gorbachev's Visit to West Germany

West German Chancellor Kohl today addressed the Federal Parliament regarding Soviet leader Gorbachev's visit to West Germany. He pointed out that this visit achieved "significant results" and laid the foundation for building a "peaceful future" in Europe.

Kohl said that through his visit to the Soviet Union last autumn and Gorbachev's current visit, "the foundation of relations between the two countries has been consolidated and greatly expanded." The "Joint Declaration" signed by the two countries is a "political program" that far exceeds the scope of "Soviet-West German relations."

Kohl said that both sides agreed that the Vienna negotiations on conventional arms control "must be vigorously advanced." To this end, he will maintain "close personal contact" with Gorbachev.

Kohl also emphasized that during Gorbachev's visit, the West German government was aware of its "special responsibility" as a partner of the United States. West Germany did not act "unilaterally," and the Soviet Union did not attempt to "undermine our ties with the West." Kohl said that Gorbachev responded "constructively" to the arms control proposals made by U.S. President Bush at the end of the month at the NATO summit.

Kohl announced that he will make an official visit to Hungary this year.

Newspaper: Berlin, June 15th

East German Foreign Ministry spokesman Mayer said on the 15th that East Germany highly values Gorbachev's visit to the Federal Republic of Germany from the 12th to the 15th of this month, believing it to be a major contribution to maintaining stability and peace in Europe.

Mayer said that Gorbachev's visit has elevated the relationship between the Soviet Union and the Federal Republic of Germany to a new level. East Germany supports the principles and goals of maintaining peace, arms control, and détente as outlined in the joint statement by Gorbachev and Kohl, believing that these align with the goals that East Germany itself pursues.

　　民主德国高度评价戈氏访问西德
    科尔说戈氏来访为和平奠定基础
    新华社波恩６月１６日电  西德总理科尔今天在联邦议院就苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫访问西德发表讲话。他指出，这次访问取得了“重大成果”，为在欧洲“建立和平的未来”奠定了基础。
    科尔说，通过他去年秋天的对苏访问和戈尔巴乔夫的这次来访，“德苏两国关系的基础巩固了并大大拓展了”。两国签署的“共同声明”是一项“政治纲领”，远远越出了“德苏关系的范围”。
    科尔说，德苏双方一致认为，维也纳常规裁军谈判“必须大力推进”。为此，他将同戈尔巴乔夫保持“紧密的个人接触”。
    科尔还强调说，西德政府在戈尔巴乔夫访问时意识到自己作为美国伙伴所承担的“特殊责任”，西德既没有“自行其是”，苏联也没有试图“动摇我们同西方的联系”。科尔说，戈尔巴乔夫对美国总统布什月底在北约首脑会议上提出的裁军建议作出了“建设性的反应”。
    科尔宣布，他将在今年对匈牙利进行正式访问。
    新华社柏林６月１５日电　民主德国外交部发言人迈耶尔１５日指出，民主德国高度评价戈尔巴乔夫本月１２日至１５日对联邦德国的访问，认为这是对维护欧洲稳定与和平所作出的重大贡献。
    迈耶尔说，戈尔巴乔夫这次访问把苏联同联邦德国之间的关系提高到了一个新的水平。民主德国支持戈尔巴乔夫和科尔共同声明中所阐述的维护和平、关于裁军和缓和所遵循的原则和所要达到的目标，认为这同民主德国自己所追求的目标是一致的。
