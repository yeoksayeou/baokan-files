	The All-China Women's Federation today issued a notice to all levels of women's federations and women from all walks of life regarding the launch of the "Love, Support, Learn from the PLA" campaign.

	The notice states that under the decisive leadership of the Party Central Committee, the People's Liberation Army's martial law troops, the People's Armed Police, and public security officers have worked closely together to decisively suppress the counter-revolutionary riot that occurred in the capital. This struggle has achieved a major victory. The soldiers have once again proven, with their new historical achievements, that they are worthy of the honorable title of the people's children and the strong pillar of defending people's democratic dictatorship.

	The notice states that the people cannot do without the army, and the army cannot do without the people. The people's army and the common people are heart to heart. However, a small number of rioters have taken the opportunity to spread rumors and incite trouble, attempting to sow discord and destroy the fish-water relationship that has been built through decades of blood and sweat. We must not let their plots succeed. Therefore, we call for the launch of the "Love, Support, Learn from the PLA" campaign among women nationwide. All levels of women's federations should unite with the majority of women, heighten vigilance, open their eyes, and resolutely fight against the small number of rioters while actively carrying out support activities for the military. The following should be done:

	--- All levels of women's federations should organize women to study the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" issued by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, unify their thoughts, strengthen their convictions, and firmly support the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot. They should stand firmly and clearly on the side of stabilizing the situation and promoting unity and stability.

	--- They should understand and support the just actions of the soldiers, fully support and assist the martial law troops, the People's Armed Police, and public security officers in restoring traffic order, maintaining social stability, and completing various martial law tasks.

	--- They should organize various forms of support and visit activities for the military, such as soldier-civilian get-togethers and heroism report meetings, to let more women care for, love, and do good deeds for the soldiers.

	--- Women should learn from the PLA's glorious traditions and revolutionary spirit through practical actions. They should actively take action, stick to their posts, fulfill their duties, do a good job in production and work, overcome all difficulties, and strive to restore production and work order. They should make up for the losses caused by the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital and the disturbances in some places.

	--- They should isolate the enemy to the maximum extent, educate women not to spread or believe in rumors, and bravely expose a small number of rioters and looters. They should play the special and important role of women in families, society, and the construction of the two civilizations.

	The notice finally calls on women from all walks of life to take action, give the soldiers more understanding and support, which is a direct contribution to defending the motherland and building modernization!

　　全国妇联发出通知
    开展“热爱、支持、学习解放军活动”
    新华社北京６月１２日电  全国妇联今天向各级妇联并各界妇女发出关于开展“热爱、支持、学习解放军活动”的通知。
    通知说，在党中央的果断决策下，经中国人民解放军戒严部队、武警部队和公安干警的密切协同，坚决反击发生在首都的反革命暴乱的斗争，已经取得了重大胜利。指战员们以新的历史功绩，再一次证明：他们无愧于人民子弟兵的光荣称号，无愧于保卫人民民主专政的坚强柱石。
    通知说，人民离不开军队，军队离不开人民，人民军队和老百姓心连心。然而，极少数暴乱分子乘机造谣煽动，企图挑拨破坏几十年来军民浴血共建的鱼水关系，我们决不能让他们的阴谋得逞。为此，我们号召：在全国妇女中广泛开展“热爱、支持、学习解放军活动”。各级妇联要团结广大妇女、提高警惕、擦亮眼睛、与极少数暴乱分子进行坚决斗争的同时，积极开展拥军活动，做到：
    ——各级妇联组织要认真组织广大妇女学习中共中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》，统一思想，坚定信念，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明地支持平息反革命暴乱，为稳定大局、促进安定团结作贡献。
    ——要理解、支持子弟兵的正义行动，全力支持和协助戒严部队、武警部队和公安干警，做好恢复交通秩序、维护社会治安、完成各项戒严任务的工作。
    ——开展多种形式的拥军慰问活动，如军民联欢会、英雄事迹报告会等，让更多的妇女关心部队、爱护部队、为子弟兵做好事。
    ——广大妇女要以实际行动向解放军学习，学习解放军的光荣传统和革命精神。积极行动起来，坚守岗位、恪尽职守、搞好生产，搞好工作，克服一切困难，尽力恢复生产秩序和工作秩序，把首都反革命暴乱和一些地方发生的动乱造成的损失夺回来。
    ——要最大限度地孤立敌人、教育广大妇女不传谣、不信谣，大胆检举、揭露一小撮暴乱分子、打砸抢分子。发挥妇女在家庭、社会中，在两个文明建设中的特殊重要作用。
    通知最后要求各界妇女积极行动起来，多给军人一份理解、一份支持，这就是对保卫祖国、建设四化的直接贡献！
