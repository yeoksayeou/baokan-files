Operational chaos leads to disaster – an inside look at the purchase of adulterated cotton by Benxi Second Textile Mill

On April 21st, this newspaper reported on the issue of adulterated cotton sent from Yanzhou Railway Station in Shandong to Benxi Second Textile Mill in Liaoning, which included 120,000 bricks and a large amount of sand. This report raised many questions: Who sent this batch of cotton? Who adulterated it with bricks and sand? Why did such a major incident occur? After more than 20 days of investigation, the truth has been uncovered: operational chaos is the root cause of the problem.

There is a regulation that cotton should be managed by the cotton and hemp company, but this has not been strictly followed. Benxi Second Textile Mill has repeatedly purchased cotton from cotton-producing areas, but often encountered difficulties and returned empty-handed. Of course, the cotton and hemp company also has its own problems. With no other way to sell cotton, they had to rely on a single buyer, which led some to reduce the grade and price, and with the cotton price already low, many farmers chose not to sell. This resulted in a strange situation: on one hand, farmers had a lot of cotton, but on the other hand, the cotton and hemp company had very little. In this situation, if Benxi Second Textile Mill only used planned cotton for production, it would have to stop production for 8 months a year, failing to complete its profit and tax tasks, and even struggling to pay the wages of thousands of employees. Therefore, they resorted to buying cotton from farmers through the back door. They obtained cotton transport permits from Liangcheng in Shandong, gave various benefits to commercial and supply departments to buy transport rights, and also paid cash to various checkpoints to ensure smooth passage. These departments did not care and did not uphold principles, allowing the adulterated cotton to pass through smoothly and reach Benxi.

The lesson for Benxi Second Textile Mill is that when faced with problems, they resorted to desperate measures. They had a large shortage of raw cotton, so they mobilized all their employees to find ways to buy cotton. Packaging worker Wu Beneyuan, through a relative, indirectly contacted Guo Guicheng from Xincheng Township in Xin County, using improper means to let Benxi Second Textile Mill's planning department head Wang Xibang sign a cotton purchase contract with Li Liancheng from Xincheng Township Supply and Marketing Cooperative. They then transferred 1000,000 yuan through a specially set up account number 127, and Guo Guicheng organized the adulteration of the cotton. Wu Beneyuan lacked purchasing experience and did not personally supervise the sellers packaging the cotton, allowing Guo Guicheng and his accomplices to take advantage of the situation.

Another lesson from this incident is the railway department's disregard for regulations to make money. Shandong Province has clear regulations that cotton outside the plan cannot be transported out of the province without a special permit. However, the Yanzhou Jiuqiao Railway Supply and Transport Station, in order to earn more transport fees, treated new cotton as "estimated cotton (old cotton)" and transported it without hesitation.

　　经营混乱酿成大祸
    ——本溪第二纺织厂购进掺假棉花透视
    段心强　王静
    本报４月２１日《掺假之风何时了》的报道，披露了山东兖州火车站发给辽宁本溪第二纺织厂的棉花中掺砖１．２万块和大量沙土的事实，同时也留给读者许多问号：这批棉花是谁发的？砖、沙是谁掺的？为什么会出这么大事件？经过２０多天的调查，水落石出：经营混乱是事件症结所在。
    棉花归棉麻公司统一经营，是有这个规定，但没做到。本溪第二纺织厂曾多次到棉产区的棉麻公司买棉花，但多是碰“顶门炮”，空手而归。当然，棉麻公司也有棉麻公司的难处。棉花销售别无出路，只能吊死在他们一棵树上，难免一些人压级压价，加上棉价本来就低，许多棉农放着不卖。这就出现一种怪现象：一方面农民手中有不少棉花，另一方面棉麻公司又棉花不多。在这种情况下，本溪第二纺织厂如果只用计划内的棉花生产，一年要停产８个月，完不成利税任务不说，几千名职工的工资也发不出去，因此便走后门从农民手中买棉花。他们从山东聊城花钱弄到省内的棉花准运证；给工商、供销部门许多好处，买到行车权；还给一道道关卡现金，留下买路钱。这些单位不管事，更不坚持原则，使掺假的棉花一路“绿灯”，发到本溪。
    本溪第二纺织厂自身的教训是有“病”乱投医。他们原棉缺口大，就发动职工有风的使风，有雨的使雨，到处想法买棉。包装工吴本元通过一个亲戚关系，拐弯抹角与莘县燕店乡郭贵勤私下联系，以不正当的手段让本溪第二纺织厂计划科长王喜邦与莘县城关供销社的李连升签订购棉合同，通过特设的１２７帐号转去１００万元，然后由郭贵勤组织掺假棉花。吴本元缺乏采购经验，没亲自监视卖棉者打包，使郭贵勤及其同伙钻了空子。
    这个事件的另一个教训是铁路部门不择手段地拿车皮买钱。山东省有明文规定，没有特殊的准运证，计划外的棉花不能出省。可兖州九仙桥铁路供销储运站，为了多要运费，把新棉花当成“估棉（破旧棉花）”运输，照发不误。
