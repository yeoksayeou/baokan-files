Mexico Publishes National Development Plan
Defend Sovereignty, Expand Democracy, Stabilize Prices, Increase Production

BEIJING, May 31 — Mexican President Carlos Salinas de Gortari today released the "1989-1994 National Development Plan," which outlines a strategy to achieve an annual economic growth rate of around 6%. President Salinas emphasized that the modernization of the nation is the responsibility of all its people.

Mexican law requires the president to present a national development plan within the first six months of his six-year term. The Salinas administration, which has been in power for half a year, proposed four main objectives in the plan: first, to defend national sovereignty and protect Mexico's legal rights in the international community; second, to expand democratic life; third, to achieve economic growth on the basis of price stability; and fourth, to improve productivity and living standards. In the political realm, the plan specifies the tasks of improving the electoral process at all levels, expanding transparency and public participation in politics, and promoting the further democratization of national life to facilitate consultation and coordination among social groups on development tasks. The economic strategy proposed in the plan aims to achieve an annual growth rate of around 6% and to control the annual inflation rate within a comparable level to Mexico's trading partners. The plan also includes measures and policies to ensure agricultural food production in line with population growth; land management and the decentralization of economic activities; strengthening housing and infrastructure construction, and focusing on the treatment of environmental pollution in the capital, Mexico City, among other tasks.

Mexican public opinion believes that this plan is a continuation of the "Economic Stabilization and Growth Agreement" implemented last December; it is also a blueprint for laying the foundation for Mexico's march into the 21st century.

　　墨西哥公布全国发展计划
    保卫主权　扩大民主　稳定价格　提高生产
    本报墨西哥城５月３１日电  记者郭伟成报道：墨西哥政府今天公布《１９８９年—１９９４年全国发展计划》，提出使墨西哥年经济增长率达到６％左右的经济战略。萨利纳斯总统强调说，实现国家现代化是全体人民的任务。
    墨西哥法律规定，总统必须在６年任期的头６个月内提出全国发展计划。今天执政刚满半年的萨利纳斯政府在上述发展计划中提出了４项基本目标：一保卫国家主权，维护墨西哥在国际社会的合法权益；二扩大民主生活；三在稳定价格的基础上实现经济增长；四提高生产率与人民生活水平。在政治方面，通过发展计划具体规定了完善各级选举进程，扩大透明度与人民在政治上参与的任务，以国家生活的进一步民主化推动社会集团对发展任务的协商与协调。计划提出的经济战略是争取使年增长率达到６％左右，并且把物价的年上涨率控制在与墨西哥贸易伙伴可比的水平内。计划还规定了与人口增长相适应的农业食品生产保证措施与政策；进行领土整治、分散经济活动；加强住宅与基础设施建设，重点治理首都墨西哥城环境污染等一系列任务。
    墨西哥舆论认为，该计划是去年１２月开始实行的《经济稳定与增长协议》的继续；也是为墨西哥走向２１世纪奠定基础的纲领。
