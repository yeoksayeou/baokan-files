Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 12th.

Song Renqiong and other members of the Central Advisory Commission visited troops, police, and security forces in the Forbidden City.

Song Renqiong, Vice Chairman of the Central Advisory Commission, and other members of the Commission visited the troops, police, and security forces in the Forbidden City this morning.

Song Renqiong said, "I and some old comrades from the Central Advisory Commission are very excited and happy to see you all. First, on behalf of the Central Advisory Commission, I extend our warm greetings and highest respect to you and to all the soldiers, police, and security forces who participated in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot. We also express our deep condolences to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives in this struggle and extend our sincere condolences to their families."

Song Renqiong said, "In the process of stopping the turmoil and suppressing the riot, you followed orders, listened to commands, maintained discipline, united as one, and bravely fought against the counter-revolutionary rioters, demonstrating a high level of political awareness and selfless revolutionary spirit. After suppressing the riot, you overcame fatigue, continued to fight, and overcame various difficulties to immediately engage in removing roadblocks, cleaning streets, delivering food and daily necessities to the people, educating the masses, and maintaining social order. In summary, you have made great contributions to maintaining the stability of the capital, defending the People's Republic of China, which was won with the blood of millions of revolutionary martyrs, defending the fundamental interests of all ethnic groups, defending the fruits of revolution, construction, and reform, and defending the leadership of the Communist Party of China. The Party and the government thank you, the people of the whole country thank you, and we old comrades who have fought for more than half a century thank you. Your actions fully demonstrate that you have withstood the severe test, are worthy of being the glorious people's army, are worthy of being the strong pillar of people's democratic dictatorship, and are worthy of being the iron wall defending socialist China. Your righteous actions are being understood and enthusiastically supported by more and more citizens and students in the capital and will inspire all ethnic groups to strive for the Four Modernizations and the rejuvenation of China."

Song Renqiong said, "The counter-revolutionary riot has not been completely suppressed, and the struggle must continue. A small number of rioters and their behind-the-scenes organizers and commanders aim to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system, replacing the People's Republic of China with a bourgeois republic. Therefore, the people's struggle against them is a serious political struggle. Although their plots have been exposed, they will continue to cause trouble until they are completely defeated. They will not deviate from this logic. We hope you will continue to maintain high vigilance and, with the support and cooperation of all ethnic groups and relevant departments, severely crack down on a small number of bad elements in accordance with the law, continue to deeply educate the people of the capital to love the people, and do your best to protect the lives and property of the masses, to make new contributions to completely suppressing the riot and fully stabilizing the situation."

Song Renqiong finally said, "On June 9th, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech to the martial law troops at the level of military officers and above is extremely important. It not only deeply expounds on the nature of this struggle and our policies but also further points out the direction for us to understand and summarize the past, think about and open up the future. Let us all take the spirit of this speech as our guide, unify our thoughts and actions, adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, adhere to reform and opening up, carry forward the revolutionary entrepreneurial spirit of hard work, honesty, diligence, and self-improvement, and continue to strive forward to build our country into a prosperous, democratic, and civilized socialist modern country!"

General Liu Zhenhua, Political Commissar of the Beijing Military Region, said in his speech, "Today, 20 old leaders and comrades from the Central Advisory Commission specially came to visit the troops, police, and security forces carrying out martial law tasks. This is a warm concern and great encouragement for us."

He said, "Just now, Comrade Song Renqiong's speech expressed the old comrades of the Central Advisory Commission's warm concern and sincere hopes for us. We must fully understand the seriousness and complexity of this struggle. The struggle to suppress the riot has not ended, and we must keep a clear mind. The People's Liberation Army, police, and security forces are the strong pillars of people's democratic dictatorship, with great responsibilities. We must seriously study the important speeches of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, Comrade Li Peng, and Comrade Yang Shangkun, and maintain high consistency in political thought with the Party Central Committee; we must continue to carry forward the 'five revolutionary spirits,' fight continuously, and together with the broad masses of the people, severely crack down on rioters, make due contributions to maintaining the order of the capital and protecting the people's peace; we must deeply carry out the 'three loves' activities, carry forward the spirit of serving the people wholeheartedly, strictly abide by discipline, insist on civilized law enforcement, and widely educate the masses, promoting military-civilian unity and the civilization construction of the capital with practical actions. We will not disappoint the old leaders and comrades, resolutely complete the martial law tasks entrusted to us by the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, and be a 'powerful, civilized, and victorious army.'"

The members of the Central Advisory Commission who went to visit today were: Wang Shoudao, Liu Lantao, Yang Dezhi, Yu Qiuyi, Song Shun, Lu Dingyi, Chen Pixin, Chen Xilian, Hu Qiaomu, Duan Junyi, Geng Biao, Ji Pengfei, Huang Hua, Huang Zhen, and Kang Shien.

Members of the Central Advisory Commission Li Lian, Zheng Tianxiang, and Zeng Zi, as well as relevant officials from the State Council, the three general departments of the People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Municipal Committee and Municipal Government, also participated in the visit.

　　宋任穷等慰问戒严部队官兵武警官兵和公安干警
    赞扬子弟兵为党为国为民立新功
    新华社北京６月１２日电  中共中央顾问委员会副主任宋任穷和中顾委部分常委，今天上午来到天安门内院慰问首都部分戒严部队官兵、武警官兵和公安干警。
    宋任穷说，我和中顾委的一些老同志来看望大家，心情很激动很高兴。首先，我们代表中顾委向你们并通过你们向所有参加这次平息反革命暴乱的解放军指战员、武警指战员和公安干警，表示亲切的问候和崇高的敬意。同时，向所有在这次平息暴乱的斗争中光荣牺牲的烈士们表示沉痛的悼念，并向他们的亲属致以诚挚的慰问。
    宋任穷说，在制止动乱和平息暴乱中，你们服从命令，听从指挥，严守纪律，团结一致，英勇反击反革命暴徒，表现出了很高的政治觉悟和无私无畏的革命精神。在粉碎暴乱后，你们又不顾疲劳，发扬连续作战的作风，克服种种困难，立即投入排除路障、清扫街道、为老百姓运送粮食和生活用品、宣传群众、维持社会秩序等工作中去。总之，你们为维护首都的安定，为保卫用几千万革命先烈的鲜血换来的社会主义的中华人民共和国，保卫各族人民的根本利益，保卫革命、建设和改革的成果，保卫中国共产党的领导，立下了新的伟大功绩。党和政府感谢你们，全国人民感谢你们，我们这些奋斗了半个多世纪的老战士、老同志感谢你们。你们用自己的行动充分表明：你们经受住了严峻的考验，不愧为光荣的人民子弟兵，不愧为人民民主专政的坚强柱石，不愧为捍卫社会主义祖国的钢铁长城。你们的正义之举，正在受到首都越来越多的市民和学生的理解和热情支持，并必将激励各族人民为建设四化，振兴中华而努力奋斗。
    宋任穷说，反革命暴乱尚未完全平息，斗争还须继续进行。极少数暴徒及其幕后的组织者和指挥者，他们制造动乱和暴乱的目的，就是妄图推翻中国共产党的领导，推翻社会主义制度，以资产阶级共和国代替社会主义的人民共和国。因此，人民同他们的斗争，是一场严重的政治斗争。他们的阴谋虽已败露，但还会继续捣乱，直至彻底失败。他们是不会违背这个逻辑的。希望你们继续保持高度警惕，在各族人民和有关部门的支持与配合下，依法严厉打击极少数坏人，继续深入进行热爱首都人民的教育，竭尽全力保护广大群众的生命、财产安全，为彻底平息暴乱、全面稳定局势再立新功。
    宋任穷最后说，６月９日，邓小平同志同戒严部队军以上干部的讲话极为重要，不仅深刻阐述了当前这场斗争的性质和我们的方针，而且为我们认识和总结过去、思考和开辟未来进一步指明了方向。让我们大家共同以这个讲话的精神为指导，统一思想，统一行动，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，发扬艰苦奋斗、廉洁奉公、励精图治、自强不息的革命创业精神，为把我国建设成为富强、民主、文明的社会主义现代化国家继续奋勇前进！
    北京军区政委刘振华上将在讲话中说，今天，中央顾问委员会的２０位老首长、老领导，专程来看望执行戒严任务的部队、武警和公安干警，这是对我们的亲切关怀和巨大鼓舞。
    他说，刚才，宋任穷同志的讲话，表达了中顾委的老前辈，对我们的热情关怀和殷切希望。我们一定要充分认识这场斗争的严重性和复杂性，平息暴乱的斗争还没有结束，要保持清醒的头脑。（⑴⑶）中国人民解放军、武警和公安干警是人民民主专政的坚强柱石，责任重大，我们一定要认真学习邓小平同志、李鹏同志和杨尚昆同志的重要讲话，在政治思想上与党中央保持高度一致；我们一定要继续发扬“五种革命精神”，连续作战，和广大人民群众一起，严厉打击暴乱分子，为维护首都秩序，保卫人民的安宁做出应有的贡献；我们一定要深入开展“三热爱”活动，发扬全心全意为人民服务的精神，严格遵守纪律，坚持文明执勤，广泛宣传群众，以实际行动促进军政军民团结和首都的文明建设。我们一定不辜负老首长、老同志的期望，坚决完成党中央、国务院、中央军委赋予我们的戒严任务，做“威武之师、文明之师、胜利之师”。
    今天前往慰问的中顾委常委是：王首道、刘澜涛、杨得志、余秋里、宋时轮、陆定一、陈丕显、陈锡联、胡乔木、段君毅、耿飚、姬鹏飞、黄华、黄镇、康世恩。
    中顾委委员李力安、郑天翔、曾志和国务院有关方面的负责人、解放军三总部及北京市委、市政府负责人也参加了慰问。
