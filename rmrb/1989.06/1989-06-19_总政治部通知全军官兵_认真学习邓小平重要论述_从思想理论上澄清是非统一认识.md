The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army recently issued a notice, requiring all military personnel, especially those at the battalion level and above, to seriously study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important statements on upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization.

The notice states that to help all military personnel deeply study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's series of important statements on upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, and to further deepen their understanding of the essence and significance of this struggle, the General Political Department has recently compiled several books, including "Deng Xiaoping on Upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and Opposing Bourgeois Liberalization," "Selected Statements by Deng Xiaoping on Upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and Opposing Bourgeois Liberalization," "Firmly Opposing Turmoil," and "Resolutely Supporting the Party Central Committee's Decision to Suppress the Counter-Revolutionary Rebellion." These books have been distributed to military personnel at the battalion level and above and to grassroots soldiers for study.

The notice from the General Political Department points out that upholding the Four Cardinal Principles is an important part of the Party's basic line and the foundation of the Party and the state. In the current situation, it is of great significance to restudy Comrade Deng Xiaoping's series of important statements on upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization.

The notice requires that all levels of Party committees and political organs use "Deng Xiaoping on Upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and Opposing Bourgeois Liberalization" as the main content for theoretical study by military personnel at the battalion level and above. They should combine the study of this book with the study of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech during his reception of senior officers of the martial law troops. They should closely link this with the actual situation of the current struggle, seriously review and summarize the experiences and lessons from the struggle to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, strive to clarify right and wrong in thought and theory, unify understanding, further enhance the awareness and firmness of upholding the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, and carry this struggle, which is related to the future of the Party and the state, to the end.
