Upon receiving the book *Selected Satirical Poems from One Hundred Chinese Poets* edited by Luo Shaoshu, I read it carefully and found it to be truly "roses have thorns but retain their fragrance."

This book includes 239 outstanding satirical poems by 101 poets from the period 1919 to 1986, providing a snapshot of satirical poetry over the past nearly seventy years.

The selected satirical poems are concise, lively, witty, and sharp, with a common touch yet not lacking in depth, and subtle yet not obscure.

Writing poetry is difficult, and writing satirical poetry is even more so. Writing excellent satirical poetry is the most challenging. What constitutes good satirical poetry? As the editor notes in the *Afterword*: "It should possess both satirical and humorous qualities, and often reveals, lashes out at, and mocks phenomena that hinder social progress." Some people compare satirical poetry to bees, which have both stingers and honey. I find this analogy quite apt.

The editor, Luo Shaoshu, is a middle-aged poet known for his satirical poetry. In compiling this book, he has been meticulous, selecting works that have had a significant impact during a certain period, as well as unique pieces that are not found in other collections. He has also paid attention to the diversity of styles, whether they are free verse, metered verse, ballads, rhymed or unrhymed, using traditional or modern techniques, all the best have been selected. What is particularly commendable is that the poems were selected based on their merit, not on the fame of the poet. Therefore, reading these poems allows one to gain an overview of the development of modern Chinese satirical poetry over the past half-century and hear the distinct voices of various poets.

The book includes brief introductions to each author's satirical poetry, and notably, it features the creative views of a group of poets, such as Lu Xun, Zang Kejia, Gong Mu, Gong Liu, Liu Shahe, Yan Yi, Yi Heyuan, and Bian Guozheng, making the content of the book even richer.

Poet Zang Kejia specially wrote a preface titled *This Flower of Satirical Poetry*, and the renowned artist Huang Yongyu inscribed the book's title. The illustrations in the book are by the cartoonists Hua Junwu, Liao Bingxie, Jiang Fan, and Liu Yong, adding greatly to the book's appeal.

"Laughter should avoid false sentiment, satire must have a sharp pen. Where the poet's blood congeals, the reader's heart understands." Indeed!

　　蔷薇带刺留真香
    ——读《中国百家讽刺诗选》
    孙重贵
    收到罗绍书选编的《中国百家讽刺诗选》，读后细细品味，果真是“蔷薇带刺留真香”。
    这本书选入一九一九—一九八六年一百○一位诗人的讽刺诗佳作二百三十九首，是现代近七十年讽刺诗的一幅缩影。
    所选的讽刺诗，短小精炼，生动活泼，风趣幽默，刺锋犀利，通俗而不寡味，含蓄而不晦涩。
    写诗难，写讽刺诗更难，写好的讽刺诗更是难上加难。何谓好讽刺诗？诚如编选者在《后记》中所述：“应是讽刺与幽默两重属性，并多以揭露、鞭挞、嘲讽有碍于社会发展的丑恶现象而见美。”有人把讽刺诗誉为蜜蜂，既有刺，又有蜜，笔者颇为认同。
    编者罗绍书先生是位写讽刺诗的中年诗人，他在选编此书时，态度严谨，既选入了一定时期影响较大之作，又选入了诸家所无，一家独创的作品，同时注意风格的多样性，无论是自由体、格律体、歌谣体，有韵无韵的，运用传统手法、新手法的，皆择优入选。尤其难能可贵的是以诗选诗，不以人定目。因此，读这些诗作，而鸟瞰中国半个多世纪以来讽刺新诗发展的概貌，可听到诸家不同凡响的心声。
    书中附有每位作者以讽刺诗创作为主的情况简介，特别令人耳目一新的是载入了一批诗家的创作论见，如鲁迅、臧克家、公木、公刘、流沙河、雁翼、易和元、边国政等，令此书的内容更加充实。
    诗人臧克家特地作序《讽刺诗这朵花》，画坛奇才黄永玉为该书书名题字，而书中插画分别为华君武、廖冰兄、江帆、刘雍四位漫画家所绘，令此书大为增色。　　“笑忌假情味，刺须真笔锋。诗家凝血处，读者有心通。”信也！
