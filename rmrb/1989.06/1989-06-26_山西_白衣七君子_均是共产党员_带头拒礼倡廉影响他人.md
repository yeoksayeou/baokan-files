The seven chief and deputy chief physicians at the Shanxi Provincial Eye Hospital, all of whom are Communist Party members, have taken the lead in refusing gifts and advocating for integrity, earning them the title of "Seven White-Garbed Gentlemen" from their patients.

These physicians—Shā Luò, Wáng Ěrguāng, Shí Zhèngqí, Rèn Shùshùn, Wáng Ruìshuǐ, Fén Kèxiào, and Shēn Chánglǐ—have addressed the current issues in the medical field where patients often face difficulties in receiving treatment or hospitalization unless they provide gifts or money. Since last year, they have led by example in refusing gifts and promoting integrity, also requiring their colleagues to do the same.

Last winter, a farmer from a mountainous area came for surgery and secretly placed 100 yuan under the pillow of Dr. Wáng Ěrguāng. Dr. Wáng discovered the money and returned it that very night. The next day, the farmer's family, still anxious, bought a box of Health Drink and left it in the operating room. However, after the surgery, the Health Drink remained unopened and was returned to the patient. This spring, a farmer from Shuozhou County brought his son for surgery and secretly placed 30 yuan in Dr. Shí Zhèngqí's pocket. When Dr. Shí declined, the farmer mistakenly thought the amount was too small and, just before entering the operating room, placed another 200 yuan in Dr. Shí's pocket. Dr. Shí temporarily accepted the money. After the surgery, Dr. Shí held a meeting with the patient to discuss the matter and returned the 200 yuan on the spot.

　　山西“白衣七君子”均是共产党员    
    带头拒礼倡廉影响他人
    新华社太原６月２６日电（通讯员胡有恒）山西省眼科医院７名共产党员、主任医师带头不收患者钱物，被患者誉为“白衣７君子”。
    这所医院的主任医师、副主任医师沙洛、王尔光、石正琦、任佘顺、王瑞姝、冯克孝、申长礼，针对目前医务界存在的病人不送钱物就看病难、住院难的不正之风，从去年开始，带头拒礼倡廉，并要求各自身边的工作人员不收患者钱物，自尊自爱。
    一名山区农民去年冬来动手术，找到将为他做手术的王尔光家，把１００元钱悄悄塞在王大夫的被子下。王尔光发现后连夜将钱退还。第二天，这位农民的家属放心不下，又买了一箱健力宝饮料放到手术室。可手术做完后，健力宝一桶未开又全部退给患者。今年春，朔县一位姓李的农民带儿子来动手术，悄悄将３０元钱塞给主治大夫石正琦，被谢绝后，这农民误认为送的钱少，第二天临进手术室时，又将２００元钱塞到石大夫口袋里。石大夫暂时收下了。做完手术后，石大夫召开了一次向患者亮心座谈会，当场将这２００元钱退给病人家属。
