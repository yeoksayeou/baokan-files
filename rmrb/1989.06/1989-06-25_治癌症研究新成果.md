	Recent research in the United States has produced several notable advancements in cancer treatment.

	Currently, researchers at Tufts University in Boston are testing a new drug for brain cancer (Imuvert). This drug, produced by bacteria, can penetrate the blood-brain barrier and activate the body's immune system to attack brain tumor cells. Initial clinical trials have shown that out of twenty-two brain cancer patients treated with this drug, nine showed significant improvement, with two cases resulting in the complete disappearance of the tumor.

	Bone and soft tissue sarcomas account for about one percent of cancer cases in the United States. While previous immunotherapy could attack cancer cells, it also harmed normal cells. Recently, researchers at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia have used lymph cell cultures that specifically target cancer cells without damaging healthy tissues.

	A tumor specialist is experimenting with a new form of radiotherapy. He first injects pigs, rabbits, horses, and monkeys with ferritin, a protein secreted in large quantities by liver cancer. Once it enters the animal's body, the immune system produces antibodies to combat the ferritin. These antibodies are then extracted and labeled with radioactive isotopes before being injected into the patient. This method not only inhibits tumor growth but also continuously releases radiation to directly kill cancerous cells.

	A newly developed computer-controlled automatic radiation heat machine has solved the problems associated with localized hyperthermia treatment. Before treating patients, researchers apply mild anesthesia to the hypothalamus to suppress normal neural function, thereby shortening treatment time and further enhancing the effectiveness of whole-body hyperthermia. In twelve clinical treatments, five cases showed stable conditions, and five cases showed significant tumor regression.

	In surgical treatments, some American doctors have begun using a procedure that replaces the surgical knife with ultrasound to remove malignant liver tumors, making the previously dangerous surgery safer.

	Dr. Stazel of the Presbyterian University Hospital has pioneered a procedure for internal organ transplantation in late-stage cancer patients. Since last June, the medical team has performed this surgery on thirteen patients near death from late-stage cancer. Their tumors were located in the liver and pancreas and could not be surgically removed. The surgery involved removing the patient's liver, pancreas, most or all of the stomach, two-thirds of the colon, the duodenum, and ten inches of the small intestine, and then replacing them with a complete set of organs from a donor. Eleven of the late-stage cancer patients who underwent this treatment not only had their lives extended but also had all the toxins removed from their bodies.

　　治癌症研究新成果
    刘正生　杨昆
    美国最近有几项治疗癌症的研究成果引人注目。
    目前，美国波士顿塔夫茨大学的研究人员正在试验一种治疗脑癌新药（Ｉｍｕｖｅｒｔ）。此药由细菌制成，可透过血脑屏障，激活机体免疫系统攻击脑肿瘤细胞。初期的临床试验表明，接受此药治疗的二十二例脑癌患者中，九例效果显著，其中有二例的癌瘤完全消退。
    骨和软组织肉瘤，在美国约占癌发病率的百分之一。过去的免疫疗法虽可攻击癌细胞，但也会伤害正常细胞。最近费城托马斯杰佛逊大学的研究者们使用淋巴培养细胞，这些细胞专门攻击癌细胞而不侵袭机体健康组织。
    一位肿瘤专家正在试验一种新式的放射疗法。他首先给猪、兔、马和猴注射铁肮。铁肮是肝癌大量分泌出来的一种蛋白质。当它进入动物体内后，这些动物的免疫系统就制造出一种抗体来对付铁肮。首先把这种抗体提取出来，并使它带上放射性同位素，然后将它注入患者体内。它不仅会抑制癌瘤的发展，而且还会连续不断地释放出射线，直接杀死癌变细胞。
    新近问世的由电脑操纵的自动辐射热机一举解决了局部加温疗法中的问题。研究人员在对患者治疗前先对下丘脑实施轻微麻醉，以抑制神经中枢的正常工作，从而缩短了治疗时间，进一步提高了全身高温疗法的医治效果。在十二例临床治疗中，有五例病情稳定，五例肿瘤明显消退。
    在手术治疗方面，美国一些医生已开始应用一种以声波代替手术刀的手术来消除肝部恶性肿瘤，使本来非常危险的手术增加了安全系数。
    美国长老会大学医院的斯塔泽尔医生还首创了一种晚期癌症病人内脏移植手术。从去年六月开始，医疗小组对十三名濒临死亡的晚期癌症病人进行了该项手术。当时，他们的癌肿分布在肝脏和胰脏一带，已不能割除。因而手术采取腹脏移植方法，把每个患者的肝、胰、大部分或全部胃、三分之二的结肠、十二指肠和十英寸长的小肠割掉，然后换上内脏捐献者的整套器官。十一位经此手术治疗的晚期癌症患者不仅延长了生命，而且除去了身上的全部毒瘤。
