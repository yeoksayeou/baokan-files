New Zealand Prime Minister David Lange said on June 15 that New Zealand will withdraw from the trilateral council of the Australia-New Zealand-United States security treaty.

As early as April this year, Lange had described the New Zealand-U.S. security relationship under the treaty as "empty." He said New Zealand was preparing to withdraw from the treaty council. On June 15, he told a press conference: "The cabinet has indeed decided to do so."

In 1985, the New Zealand government refused to allow a U.S. nuclear warship to enter a New Zealand port. Three years ago, New Zealand passed an anti-nuclear law. Since then, the United States has excluded New Zealand from military cooperation.

Lange emphasized that New Zealand is not confronting the United States, while also pointing out that New Zealand has a firm belief in the anti-nuclear issue. This belief is not open to debate, and no one can persuade New Zealand to abandon it.

### 朗伊指称新美安全徒有虚名  新西兰将退出澳新美理事会

　　朗伊指称新美安全徒有虚名
    新西兰将退出澳新美理事会
    新华社惠灵顿电  新西兰总理戴维·朗伊６月１５日说，新西兰将从澳、新、美安全条约的三国理事会中退出。
    早在今年４月，朗伊曾描述在上述条约下的新美安全关系是“徒有虚名”的，新西兰准备退出条约理事会。１５日他在一个记者招待会上又说：“内阁当然已经决定这样做了。”
    １９８５年，新西兰政府拒绝一艘美国核军舰进入新西兰港口。３年前，新西兰又通过了一项反核法。自此，美国将新西兰排除在军事合作之外。
    朗伊一方面强调新西兰没有与美国对抗，同时又指出，新西兰在反核问题上有着坚定的信念。这种信念是不容争辩的，谁也不能说服新西兰放弃它。
