Egypt and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) held a high-level meeting, with both sides expressing reservations about Shamir's proposal.

Our reporter Lin Jiaming reports from Cairo on June 13: Egypt and the PLO "principally do not reject Shamir's election plan," but still have reservations and questions.

PLO Executive Committee Chairman Arafat arrived in Cairo yesterday to discuss with Egyptian President Mubarak the plan proposed by Israel to hold free elections in the occupied territories.

After the meeting, President Mubarak told the press, "We principally do not reject holding elections in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, but we still have reservations and questions that need to be answered." Chairman Arafat also holds this position and insists that the elections must be part of a comprehensive peace solution.

President Mubarak also announced that the Egyptian government has sent Deputy Foreign Minister Boutros Ghali to Israel to discuss the election plan with Shamir, conveying Egypt's stance and the need for further clarification on certain issues, "so that a decision can be made on this matter."

Egyptian Deputy Foreign Minister Boutros Ghali returned to Cairo on the evening of the 12th. During his one-day visit to Israel, he conveyed President Mubarak's message to Prime Minister Shamir and held talks with representatives of the Palestinians in the occupied territories. Ghali later told the outside world that the Palestinian representatives hoped Egypt would act as a bridge between the Palestinians and Israel.

　　埃及巴解举行高级会晤
    双方对沙米尔建议仍有保留
    本报开罗６月１３日电  记者林皎明报道：埃及和巴勒斯坦解放组织“原则上不拒绝沙米尔选举计划”，但仍有保留和疑问。
    巴解组织执委会主席阿拉法特昨天抵达开罗，与埃及总统穆巴拉克磋商有关以色列提出的在被占领土进行自由选举的计划。
    穆巴拉克总统会谈后对新闻界说，“我们原则上不拒绝在约旦河西岸和加沙地带进行选举，但是仍有保留和需要解答的疑问。”阿拉法特主席也持上述立场，并坚持选举必须是全面和平解决的一部分。
    穆巴拉克总统同时宣布，埃及政府派外交国务部长加利去以色列，与沙米尔讨论选举计划，转达埃及的态度和需要进一步澄清的问题，“以便对此作出决定”。
    埃及外交国务部长加利已于１２日晚回到开罗。他在对以色列为期１天的访问中，向沙米尔总理转达了埃及总统的口信，并与被占领土巴勒斯坦人代表会谈。加利事后对外界说，巴勒斯坦代表希望埃及成为巴勒斯坦与以色列对话的桥梁。
