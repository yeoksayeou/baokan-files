The Polish "Solidarity Weekly," an official publication of the Solidarity Trade Union, was officially published here on June 2.

"The Solidarity Weekly" is the second regular publication of the Solidarity Trade Union approved by the Polish authorities.

In its first issue, "The Solidarity Weekly" published an interview with Lech Wałęsa, the chairman of the Solidarity Trade Union. Wałęsa pointed out that the Solidarity Trade Union "should engage less in politics and pay more attention to workers and their working and living conditions." He hopes that "The Solidarity Weekly" will fully reflect the nature and tasks of the Solidarity Trade Union in its reporting and editorial policies. It should report on the creative labor and daily lives of workers and become a publication that workers love to read.
