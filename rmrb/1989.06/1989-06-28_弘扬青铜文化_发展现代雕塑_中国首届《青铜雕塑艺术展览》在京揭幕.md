A new chapter in Chinese sculpture history has been opened. This is the assessment of art circles regarding the opening of China's first "Bronze Sculpture Art Exhibition" in Beijing.

The exhibition, which will begin on June 29th at the China Art Museum in Beijing, showcases works from the first generation of Chinese sculptors who studied in France at the beginning of the 20th century to the new stars of the 1980s. The scale of this exhibition surpasses all previous sculpture exhibitions in China. The significance lies in the fact that all 140-plus exhibits are cast in bronze and other metal materials, marking the end of an era where most Chinese sculptures could only be presented in plaster form.

China entered the mature age of bronze artifacts as early as the Shang Dynasty, boasting a 4,000-year history of splendid bronze culture. However, this historical river has almost dried up in the past century in the realm of Chinese art. Due to the disconnect between art and technology, creation and production, China has long lacked a dedicated "sculpture publisher" for casting metal artworks. Sculptors' masterpieces have mostly existed only in the transitional material form of plaster, subject to decay and damage. Even the renowned Chinese sculptor Wei Tianyou, who was listed among the world's cultural figures in the 1930s, left behind only plaster statues. His masterpiece, which won the "Rome Gold Medal" in France, remains a plaster piece to this day.

Last year, the Sichuan Province Bronze Art Research Institute was established, beginning the work of rectifying a long-standing regret in Chinese sculpture history. This institute, which brings together experts, scholars, and veteran artisans specializing in precision casting and surface treatment, aims to promote Chinese bronze culture and develop metal sculpture. With the support of more than 30 art units nationwide, they have transformed nearly 90 outstanding works by sculptors of the past century into metal pieces, rescuing a batch of sculptures on the verge of damage. All 140-plus exhibits in this exhibition were produced by this research institute.

Relevant officials believe that the emergence of this "sculpture publisher" holds profound significance for the inheritance and development of Chinese bronze culture, broadening the path of sculpture art, enabling sculptors' creations to enter households, and breaking into the international market.

　　弘扬青铜文化　发展现代雕塑    
    中国首届《青铜雕塑艺术展览》在京揭幕
    本报北京６月２８日讯  记者向兵报道：中国雕塑史上新的一页揭开了。这是艺术界有关人士对中国首届《青铜雕塑艺术展览》的评价。
    将于２９日起在北京中国美术馆举办的这次展览，荟萃了我国自本世纪初第一代留法学习的雕塑家到８０年代新秀们的作品，其规模超过了我国历次的雕塑作品展览；其意义更在于参展的１４０余件作品，全用青铜等金属材料铸成。它结束了我国大多雕塑作品只能以石膏形式问世的历史。
    我国早在殷商之世就进入了青铜器的成熟时代，有着四千年光辉灿烂的青铜文化史。然而这条历史长河，在近百年来的中国艺术园地上却几乎断流。由于艺术和科技，创作和生产的脱节，长期来中国没有一个专门铸造金属艺术品的“雕塑出版社”。雕塑艺术家的精作，大都始终只能以过渡材质——石膏形式存在，任其粉化、破损。３０年代即列入世界文化名人的中国雕塑大师渭田友先生一生留下来的也只能是些石膏像，就连当年在法国获“罗马金奖”的杰作，至今仍是石膏品。
    去年四川省青铜艺术研究所成立，开始了弥补我国雕塑史上常年遗憾的工作。这家集中了一批专事精密铸造、表面处理的专家、学者和老艺人的研究所，以弘扬我国青铜文化，发展金属雕塑为宗旨。他们在国内３０多家艺术单位的支持下，将我国本世纪来近９０名卓有成就的雕塑艺术家的优秀作品，变成了金属品，抢救了一批濒于破损的雕塑杰作。这次展出的１４０多件作品，全由这个研究所制作。
    有关方面人士认为，这家“雕塑出版社”的出现，对于我国青铜文化的继承、发扬，拓宽雕塑艺术道路，使得雕塑家的创作进入群众家庭，打入国际市场等都具有深远的意义。
