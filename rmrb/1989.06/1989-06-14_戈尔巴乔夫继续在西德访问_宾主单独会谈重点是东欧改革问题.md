Gorbachev Continues Visit to West Germany
Hosts Hold Private Talks Focused on Eastern European Reforms

Bonn, June 14 (Xinhua) - Soviet leader Gorbachev continued his visit to West Germany today, holding a second private meeting with Chancellor Kohl and delivering a speech on bilateral economic relations at the German Eastern Economic Committee in Cologne. In the evening, he attended a grand state banquet hosted by West German President von Weizsacker. Both sides highly praised Gorbachev's visit. Chancellor Kohl said that relations between West Germany and the Soviet Union have undergone a significant shift, while Gorbachev stated that bilateral relations have reached a new level.

According to sources, Kohl and Gorbachev's private meeting yesterday afternoon focused on changes in Eastern Europe. Gorbachev emphasized that the Soviet Union would not interfere in the internal reform processes of Eastern European countries, and that Warsaw Pact nations have full autonomy to determine their reform policies based on their own situations. He hoped that the West, particularly West Germany, would also refrain from interfering in the internal reforms of Eastern European countries. Chancellor Kohl stated that West Germany does not wish for unrest in Eastern European countries and is willing to develop relations with all Warsaw Pact nations, not just a few.

Yesterday afternoon, Gorbachev delivered a speech on bilateral economic relations at the German Eastern Economic Committee in Cologne. He noted that the Soviet Union and West Germany have mutual needs, but the current bilateral trade volume is only 50-60 billion rubles, which is quite low. There are only 72 joint ventures with a total investment of 2.04 billion rubles, and West Germany's investment is only 77 million rubles. The broad possibilities for economic cooperation between the two sides have not been fully utilized.

He stated that the Soviet Union will not retreat from the chosen path of economic democratization and will not revert to the stagnation of the past. The Soviet Union is currently drafting price reform plans and new foreign trade laws, aiming to establish a completely new system of external economic and trade relations, and strive to coordinate with the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. He urged the German business community to adopt a strategic perspective on bilateral cooperation.

Gorbachev's delegation will fly to Stuttgart this morning to visit Baden-Württemberg for a day. Tonight, he will hold his third private meeting with Chancellor Kohl, which has been added to the schedule.

　　戈尔巴乔夫继续在西德访问
    宾主单独会谈重点是东欧改革问题
    本报波恩６月１４日电  记者江建国报道：正在西德访问的苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫昨天下午同科尔总理进行了第二次单独会谈，并在科隆的德国经济东方委员会就双边经济关系发表了演讲。晚上出席了西德总统冯·魏茨泽克举行的盛大国宴。西德苏联双方高度评价戈尔巴乔夫的访问。科尔总理说，西德苏联关系已经发生转折，戈尔巴乔夫说，双边关系已经达到了一个新的水平。
    据此间人士透露，科尔与戈尔巴乔夫昨天下午的单独会谈重点谈了东欧地区的变化。戈尔巴乔夫强调，苏联不干涉东欧国家内部的改革进程，华约各国有充分的自主权根据自己的情况决定改革政策，他希望西方，特别是西德也不要干涉东欧国家内部改革。科尔总理说，西德不希望东欧国家发生动乱，愿意同华约的所有国家，而不仅仅是某几个国家发展关系。据说，戈尔巴乔夫对此感到满意。
    昨天下午，戈尔巴乔夫在科隆的德国经济东方委员会就双边经济关系发表了演讲。他说，苏联和西德互相需要，但目前双边贸易额仅为５０—６０亿卢布，少得可怜。合资企业仅有７２个，总投资额仅为２．０４亿卢布，西德投资额不过７７００万卢布。双方经济合作的广泛可能性显然还未充分利用。
    他说，苏联方面不会从已经择定的经济民主化道路上后退，不会退回到停滞时代的状况去。苏联正在制订价格改革方案和新的外贸法律，总之，将建立全新的对外经济贸易关系体制，努力与关贸总协定相协调。他呼吁西德经济界以战略眼光看待双边合作。
    戈尔巴乔夫一行今天上午飞往斯图加特，对巴登—符腾堡州进行一天访问。今天晚上他将同科尔总理进行第３次单独会谈，这次会谈是临时增加的。
