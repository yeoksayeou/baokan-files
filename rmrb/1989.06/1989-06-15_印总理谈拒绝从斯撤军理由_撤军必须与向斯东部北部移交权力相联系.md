Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi said on June 14 that India supports the withdrawal of troops from Sri Lanka, but the withdrawal must be linked to the transfer of power to the eastern and northern regions of Sri Lanka.

Rajiv Gandhi said that India has clearly stated its position to Sri Lanka. He said: "India is a joint guarantor of the Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement, and before the agreement is fully implemented, we are responsible, first of all, for the safety of the Tamil people in Sri Lanka, and at the same time, for the unity and integrity of that island nation."

Sri Lankan President Premadasa formally requested on June 1 that India withdraw all its troops from Sri Lanka by July 29, the second anniversary of the agreement between the two countries. However, the Indian side formally rejected this request. India said the withdrawal timetable is "unilateral and unrealistic."

Rajiv Gandhi said that as long as the Sri Lankan government has not fully transferred power in the eastern and northern regions to the local government, the agreement between the two countries has not been fully implemented.

　　印总理谈拒绝从斯撤军理由
    撤军必须与向斯东部北部移交权力相联系
    新华社新德里６月１４日电  印度总理拉·甘地１４日说，印度赞成从斯里兰卡撤军，但撤军必须同向斯里兰卡东部和北部移交权力联系在一起。
    拉·甘地说，印度已向斯里兰卡明确表明了其立场。他说：“印度是印—斯协议的联合保证国，在协议完全得到履行前，我们是负责任的，首先对斯里兰卡的泰米尔人的安全负责，同时也对那个岛国的统一和完整负责。”
    斯里兰卡总统普雷马达萨６月１日正式要求印度在两国协议两周年的７月２９日前，全部从斯里兰卡撤军。但印方正式予以拒绝。印度说这一撤军的时间表是“单方面的和不现实的”。
    拉·甘地说，在斯里兰卡政府没有完全将东部和北部的权力移交给地方政府之前，两国的协议就未完全得到履行。
