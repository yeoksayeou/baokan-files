The counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing has caused many difficulties for the printing and distribution of our newspaper. Starting from June 7th, our newspaper had to be published with only four pages. Now, the struggle to quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion has achieved decisive victory, and order in the Beijing region has been restored to normal. All factors affecting the normal publication of our eight-page newspaper have been eliminated. Therefore, starting from today, our newspaper will resume publishing eight pages daily. The newspaper was published with four pages for a total of 18 days. To compensate for the loss of our subscribers, we will gradually compile and print supplements and additional pages, which will be sent along with the newspaper to all subscribers. We will not handle the refund of newspaper fees separately. We appreciate the understanding of our readers.

　　本报启事
    北京发生的反革命暴乱给本报印刷发行造成许多困难，从６月７日起，本报不得不改出四块版。现在，平息反革命暴乱的斗争已经取得决定性胜利，北京地区的秩序恢复正常，影响本报正常出八块版的各种因素都已消除。因此，从今天起本报恢复每天出八块版。本报改出四块版共１８天。为了弥补订户的损失，我们将陆续编印增刊、附页，随报送各订户，不再另办退还报费手续。敬请读者谅解。
