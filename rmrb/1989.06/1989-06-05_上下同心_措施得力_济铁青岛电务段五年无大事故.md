Qingdao Electric Section has achieved five years of safe production, ranking among the best in the entire railway system. By mid-May, it had already maintained over 1,800 days without any major accidents, setting a new historical record for the bureau and being recognized as an advanced unit for safety and quality by both the Jinan Railway Bureau and Qingdao City, as well as being rated as a second-class enterprise.

This section has over 700 employees and is responsible for the maintenance of communication and signaling systems for nearly 300 kilometers of operational lines on the eastern section of the Jiaoji Line and the Lanyan Branch Line, as well as 33 stations. In the past, there were frequent issues with "blind eyes" and "deaf ears," leading to numerous accidents, sometimes up to 20 incidents in a single year. In 1985, the new leadership team, led by Section Chief Xu Feng'e, studied the party's reform and opening-up policies and focused on ensuring safety and improving railway capacity. They implemented three targeted measures:

First, they reformed the management system to strengthen the organizational foundation for safety production. They established a comprehensive management system centered around the section chief, covering production organization and command, safety supervision and assurance, technical consultation services, and information dynamic control. They also implemented a safety policy and target responsibility system at all levels, with clear rewards and punishments, fully mobilizing the enthusiasm of the employees. The enterprise system better adapted to the needs of safety production in the railway electric section. The information control system alone handled over 12,000 safety information items and addressed over 3,500 unsafe factors, preventing 37 train accidents.

Second, they improved technical equipment to provide a scientific guarantee for safety production. The section learned from both positive and negative experiences, focusing on improving safety production equipment and enhancing the technical skills of employees as a fundamental measure. Over the past five years, while ensuring normal equipment maintenance tasks, they completed over 5 million yuan in equipment renovation and transformation projects, effectively controlling safety production from the equipment side.

Third, they changed the leadership style to solve key safety production issues. Cadres went to the front lines to promptly break through difficulties. The party, government, trade union, and youth league, along with 60-plus cadres from the headquarters, adopted a divisional responsibility system for the section's 98 teams, with rewards and punishments linked together. The section chief and deputy section chief held monthly on-site meetings, and half of the functional department cadres participated in team work. Two full-time safety cadres spent five days a week along the lines, collecting information. Therefore, the pulse of safety production was accurately grasped, and issues were handled promptly, boosting everyone's enthusiasm for safety production.

　　上下同心　措施得力
    济铁青岛电务段五年无大事故
    本报讯  青岛电务段实现五年安全生产，名列全路前茅。到５月中旬，已连续１８００多天无重大事故，创全局历史最高纪录，被评为济南路局和青岛市的安全优质先进单位和二级企业。
    这个段共有７００多名职工，担负着胶济线东段和兰烟支线近３００运营公里线路和３３个站的通信信号维修任务和电报电话业务，前几年“眼不明”、“耳不灵”、事故不断，有时一年发生２０多件。１９８５年新的段领导班子成员在段长徐风峨的带领下认真学习党的改革开放的路线方针，在确保安全生产提高铁路运能上下功夫，有针对性地采取了三条措施。
    一改革管理体制，夯实安全生产的组织基础。他们建立了以段长为中心的生产组织指挥、安全监督保证、技术咨询服务、信息动态控制等一个全方位的管理系统，并层层实行安全方针目标承包责任制，奖惩分明，充分调动了职工积极性。企业体制更加适应铁路电务部门安全生产的需要，仅信息控制系统就受理安全信息１２０００多条，处理不安全因素３５００多件，防止了３７起行车事故。
    二改善技术设备，提供安全生产的科学保证。这个段吸取过去正反两方面的经验教训，把改善安全生产的设备条件和提高职工技术素质作为搞好安全生产的根本措施之一，五年来在保证正常的设备维修任务前提下，他们共完成５００多万元的设备更新改造工程，已从设备上对安全生产进行了有效控制。
    三改变领导作风、解决安全生产的关键问题。干部深入一线，及时突破难关。段党政工团和机关６０多名干部对全段９８个班组实行划片包干，奖惩挂钩。正副段长每月一次到现场办公，职能部门干部半数时间参加班组工作，有两名安全专职干部每周五天泡在沿线，搜集信息，因此安全生产脉搏摸得准，处理快，大家安全生产的劲头越来越足。
