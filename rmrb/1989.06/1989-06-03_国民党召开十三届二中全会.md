Taipei - The Kuomintang's 13th Central Committee Second Plenary Session began today and will continue for three days. This session will discuss Taiwan's political, economic, and party affairs. Recent developments on the mainland are also on the agenda.

Newly appointed Kuomintang Central Secretariat Director Song Chuyu said yesterday, "The Second Plenary Session will continue to push forward work on the existing foundation." The meeting will hear the administrative report from the newly appointed Premier Li Huan, Song Chuyu's party affairs report, and the "mainland situation report" from the Kuomintang's Mainland Affairs Committee.

The Central Evaluation Committee, composed of Kuomintang elders, will also hold a one-day meeting tomorrow.

Kuomintang Chairman Lee Teng-hui proposed a list of 31 Central Standing Committee members before the meeting ended. It is generally expected that the list of 31 Central Standing Committee members will not change, but because there has been a reorganization of party and government personnel, the ranking of the Central Standing Committee members will undergo significant adjustments.

    国民党召开十三届二中全会
    新华社香港6月3日电　台北消息：国民党十三届二中全会于今天起连续举行三天。这次全会将讨论台湾的政治、经济及国民党党务，大陆最近情势的发展也被列为议程之一。
    新任国民党中央秘书长宋楚瑜昨天表示，“二中全会是在旧有基础上继续推动工作”。会议将听取新任“行政院长”李焕的行政报告，宋楚瑜的党务报告，以及国民党大陆工作会的“大陆情势报告”。
    由国民党元老组成的中央评议委员会也将在明天举行一天的会议。
    国民党主席李登辉今天在会议结束前提出31名中常委的名单，一般预料，这31名中常委名单不会易动，但因为已进行过党政人事改组，所以中常委的排名会有大幅度调整。
