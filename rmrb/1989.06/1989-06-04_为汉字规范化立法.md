Title: Legislation for the Standardization of Chinese Characters

The current state of Chinese character usage can be described as a "Cultural Revolution" of characters. On one hand, non-standard simplified characters are ubiquitous; on the other hand, traditional characters are being widely revived. The latter is particularly severe. The "Simplified Character Table," which serves as the national standard for characters, was approved and published by the State Council. Various uses of characters, such as printing and publishing, television and film, enterprise and shop signs, product packaging, advertisements, etc., all have specific regulations from the State Language Commission and relevant departments. However, many departments are now arbitrarily reviving traditional characters and using them extensively, which is incorrect.

The standardization of characters is a marker of a country's level of civilization. The chaotic use of Chinese characters seriously damages the image of this ancient civilization and severely hinders the function of characters, causing inconvenience for many tasks. The majority of people in our country have a low level of education, and the chaos in characters especially brings them difficulties, particularly harming the more than 400 million young children. This is a completely man-made disaster.

There is an argument that using traditional characters is a necessity for opening up; because Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan have not simplified their characters, and overseas Chinese do not like simplified characters. This argument does not hold up. First, assuming that using traditional characters helps overseas Chinese, for the convenience of these few million overseas Chinese, we cause inconvenience for the 100 million people within China. Is this reasonable? Second, no matter how much traditional characters are revived, simplified characters will not be abolished. As long as simplified characters are used domestically, overseas Chinese will have to read simplified character books and newspapers and learn simplified characters. Therefore, the chaotic use of traditional characters does not help overseas Chinese. Third, simplicity is more convenient than complexity. The feelings of overseas Chinese will not be different from ours. As long as we firmly use standardized simplified characters, they will gradually adapt and ultimately use simplified characters. As for the fact that Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan have not simplified their characters, we can use the "one country, two systems" approach in the short term. Moreover, the above three points are also applicable to Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan.

Given the chaotic state of Chinese character usage, I suggest that the National People's Congress legislate for the standardization of Chinese characters. Establish a temporary special committee to study this issue and use legal forms to constrain the standardized use of characters; for various official printed materials, television and film, product packaging, various signs, fixed propaganda slogans, etc., there should be specific regulations for the use of characters; for phenomena that violate character standards, there should be effective punitive measures. The "standardized use" mentioned here also includes traditional characters. Some specific character uses must use traditional characters (such as restoring ancient sites, publishing ancient books for research, etc.), and the scope should also be clearly defined.

Before formulating character usage regulations, a review of character simplification should be conducted. On one hand, some simplified characters are indeed simplified unreasonably and can be adjusted appropriately. For example, "余" and "馀," "折" and "摺," since these characters are sometimes still used, it is better to not simplify them; just like the handling of "迭" and "叠," "象" and "像." For example, many people have deep feelings for the character "華," and it can be considered not to simplify it. On the other hand, under the premise of not damaging the expression of meaning and not increasing the number of homophones, the method of simplifying complex characters can be used to reduce some characters. Some characters have similar meanings and are already in common use, such as "反返、飞蜚、回迴、皇惶、历砺、驼鸵," and the complex characters can be simplified. Some characters only have phonetic functions and can be replaced with simplified homophones, such as using "巴答巴答" to replace "吧嗒吧嗒," "辟里拍拉" to replace "噼里啪拉," "丁东丁东" to replace "叮咚叮咚," "匡当匡当" to replace "哐哐噹噹," etc. Some characters that have already been commonly used in society, such as "采（彩）、灿（粲）、付（傅）、家（傢)," can be legally "legitimized." Many compound words have multiple forms, such as "倘佯、徜徉; 仿佛、彷彿; 蒙龙、曚昽、朦胧、矇眬; 旁皇、彷徨、徬徨," and simplified forms should be chosen. Chinese characters should be stable and should not be continuously simplified. But taking the opportunity of legislating for character standardization, using the above methods to simplify a batch of characters will only be beneficial and will not be harmful.

After legislating for character standardization, I suggest that the state publish a standard Chinese dictionary and urge leaders to take the lead in adhering to character standards, and call on calligraphers to study the form of standardized Chinese characters.

### 为汉字规范化立法

　　为汉字规范化立法
    黄瑞云
    当前汉字使用混乱的程度，可以称之为汉字的“文化大革命”。一方面，不正规的简化字随处可见；另一方面，繁体字却在大量复旧。就当前情况看，后者尤为严重。作为国家用字规范的《简化字总表》是经国务院批准制定公布的；各种用字，诸如印刷出版、电视电影、企业商店的牌匾、商品包装、广告等等，国家语言文字工作委员会同各有关领导部门，都有具体规定。但现在许多部门随意复旧，大量使用繁体字，是不对的。
    文字的规范与否，是一个国家文明水平的标志之一。汉字使用如此混乱，严重损害了文明古国的形象，也严重妨碍了文字功能，给许多工作带来不便。我国大多数人文化水平不高，文字的混乱，特别给他们带来困难，尤其是坑害了多达四亿的少年儿童。这完全是人为的灾难。
    有一种论调认为，使用繁体是开放的需要；因为港澳台湾的汉字没有简化，海外华人也不喜欢简化字。这种论点是站不住脚的。第一，假定使用繁体有助于海外华人，为了这几千万海外华人的方便，却给十亿海内华人造成不便，难道这是合理的吗？第二，不管把繁体复旧到什么程度，总不至于废掉简化字，而只要国内使用简化字，海外华人也就不能不看简化字书报，不能不学简化字。因此乱用繁体字，并无助于海外华人。第三，简易比繁难方便，海外华人的感觉同我们不会两样，只要我们坚定地使用规范简字，他们也就会慢慢适应，并且最终使用简化字。至于港澳台湾的汉字没有简化，短时间可用“一国两制”的办法对待。而且上述三点，对港澳台湾也是适合的。
    鉴于汉字使用情况的混乱，我建议全国人大为汉字规范化立法。成立临时的专门委员会来研究这个问题，对汉字的规范使用，用法律的形式加以约束；对各种正规印刷品、电视电影、商品包装、各种招牌、固定的宣传标语等等，使用文字，都要有具体的法规；对违反用字规范的现象，要有有效的制裁措施。这里所说的“规范使用”，还包括繁体。有些特定的用字必须使用繁体的（如恢复古迹、出版供研究用的古籍等），也应规定明确的范围。
    在制定用字法规之前，对汉字的简化应进行一次审核。一方面，简化字中有个别确实简得不合理的，可以适当调整。如“余”和“馀”、“折”和“摺”，既然“馀、摺”二字有时仍然要用，不如干脆不简；就像对“迭”和“叠”、“象”和“像”的处理一样。又如许多人对“華”字感情深厚，也可以考虑不简。另一方面，在不损害字义表达、不增加字音异读的前提下，用以简代繁的办法，还可以压减一些字。有些字甲乙二字意义相通，本来就通用的，如“反返、飞蜚、回迴、皇惶、历砺、驼鸵”之类，可把其中的繁字简掉。有些字仅有表音作用，可用同音简字代替，如用“巴答巴答”代“吧嗒吧嗒”、“辟里拍拉”代“噼里啪拉”、“丁东丁东”代“叮咚叮咚”、“匡当匡当”代“哐哐噹噹”等。有些在社会流通中早已代用的字，如“采（彩）、灿（粲）、付（傅）、家（傢）”之类，可以法定“扶正”。不少联绵词，有多种形态，如“倘佯、徜徉；仿佛、彷彿；蒙龙、曚昽、朦胧、矇眬；旁皇、彷徨、徬徨”等，应该去繁取简。汉字应该稳定，不宜连续不断地简下去。但趁为用字规范立法之机，采取上述办法简掉一批，只有好处，绝无害处。
    为汉字规范立法之后，我建议国家出版一部汉文规范字典，请求领导人带头遵守用字规范，并呼吁书法家研究规范汉字的造型。
