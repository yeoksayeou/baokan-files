The resolution passed by the first Soviet People's Congress today calls on the Soviet people to continue steadfastly and vigorously pushing forward with reforms.

The resolution on the basic guidelines for the Soviet Union's domestic and foreign policies, adopted by the first Soviet People's Congress from May 25 to June 9, states that the country "has not yet overcome the crisis." It notes that while reforms have generated great hope, they have not yet yielded the expected results, especially in the economic and social spheres. Certain issues have intensified, and social tensions have risen.

The resolution focuses primarily on economic issues. It states that due to a lack of comprehensive planning and insufficient decisive action, economic reforms and the establishment of new management mechanisms have encountered serious obstacles. To deepen economic reforms, the People's Congress tasks the Supreme Soviet and the government with completing five tasks: developing various forms of socialist ownership, creating equal conditions for national ownership, local ownership, cooperative ownership based on leasing, shares, and individual labor, and various mixed ownership forms to foster competition; transitioning to wholesale trade of means of production within a few years to create conditions for a socialist market economy, including securities and investment markets; addressing the issues of loss-making and low-profit enterprises through leasing, cooperation, and closure; reforming the financial system, implementing resource fees and progressive profit (income) taxes; and reforming the import and export structure to gradually address the exchange of the ruble.

In discussing legal matters, the resolution emphasizes that in the socio-political and economic activities of citizens, groups, and enterprises, the principle should be clear: whatever is not prohibited by law should be permitted. The People's Congress demands strengthening the fight against corruption, organized crime, theft, and bribery.

In addressing another major issue facing Soviet society—the nationalities question—the resolution points out that this problem should be approached realistically, with a reasonable and wise attitude towards national relations, allowing all nationalities to develop fully within the framework of a federal union. Due to the complexity and sensitivity of national disputes, all nationalities should practice mutual understanding, benevolence, and restraint.

The resolution believes that the current international situation has significantly eased, but positive changes in arms reduction and trust-building are not irreversible. The Soviet Union still needs to further develop its armed forces in terms of quality.

　　苏联首届人大通过决议    
    危机尚未摆脱　努力推进改革
    新华社莫斯科６月２４日电  今天此间发表的苏联首届人代会决议，呼吁苏联人民继续坚定不移、奋发努力地推进改革。
    ５月２５日至６月９日召开的首届苏联人民代表大会通过了一项关于苏联内外政策基本方针的决议。决议认为，国家“尚未摆脱危机”，“改革产生了巨大的希望，但暂时还未带来预期的成果，尤其是在经济和社会领域。某些问题激化，社会气氛紧张”。
    决议重点谈经济问题。其中说，由于缺乏通盘考虑，行动不彻底、不坚决，经济改革和新经营机制的形成严重受挫。为了深化经济改革，人代会责成最高苏维埃和政府完成五项任务：发展社会主义所有制的多种形式，为全国所有制，地方所有制，以租赁、股份和个体劳动为基础的合作所有制及各种混和所有制的发展和竞赛创造平等的条件；近年内过渡到生产资料批发贸易，为形成包括有价证券和投资市场在内的社会主义市场创造条件；通过租赁、合作和关闭，解决亏损和低利企业问题；改革金融，实行资源收费和累进利润（收入）税；改革进出口结构，逐步解决卢布的兑换问题。
    决议在谈到法制时强调，在公民、团体和企业的社会政治和经济活动中，应明确一个原则，凡是法律不禁止的，都应许可。人代会要求加强对贪污腐化、集团犯罪、盗窃和受贿等现象的斗争。
    决议在谈到苏联社会当前另一大难题——民族问题时指出，解决这一问题应从现实出发，以合理明智的态度对待民族关系问题，使各民族在联邦制联盟国家范围内全面发展。由于民族纠纷极为复杂、敏感，各民族应相互谅解、与人为善、克制。
    决议认为当前国际形势已大大和缓，但裁军和加强信任方面的积极变化并非不可逆转，苏联仍需从质量上进一步发展武装力量。
