Japan-China Economic and Trade Center Chairman Kiyoshi Yoshizawa wrote in the June 22 issue of the weekly "Business Liaison" that the Japanese trade community, through long-term arduous efforts, has established today's economic relations with China. Sino-Japanese economic relations are the fruit of cooperation between many people on both sides and are a precious asset for both countries. The decades-long history of Sino-Japanese trade can also withstand today's test.

The article mentions that since the founding of New China, the imposition of martial law in Beijing for the first time is indeed an extraordinary event, which is a matter of China's internal affairs, and our trade should continue. What should be emphasized now is that the Japanese trade community should not remain at the superficial level of merely buying and selling. China has immense potential, and for both Japan and the peace and stability of Asia, it is an irreplaceable neighboring country. Sino-Japanese relations cannot be compared with the relations between Europe, America, and China; they are inseparable relations. Therefore, regarding China, we should not be misled by temporary phenomena but should stand firm in the long-term and continue our work.

According to the June 25 report by the "Nihon Keizai Shimbun," Matsushita Electric Industries President Shota Taniguchi said that China's economic policies will not undergo major changes, and the implementation of an open economic policy is a historical necessity. Economic cooperation with China will not shrink. Due to this turmoil, the scheduled start date for the Beijing Cathode Ray Tube Factory has been postponed. As long as China adheres to the open policy, the start date will surely come. We are now watching the developments and studying the start date. Fujitsu President Takamasa Yamamoto said that Fujitsu's staff in Beijing and Shanghai temporarily returned to Japan, and returning to work is a matter of course. We believe that China will continue to implement the open policy in the future, and we will also cooperate calmly. Mitsubishi Heavy Industries President Yutaro Iida said that China's electricity is severely insufficient, and our company's stance is to cooperate fully in any way we can. There is no consideration of changing this attitude.

　　日本经济界人士指出
    日中经济关系经得起考验
    本报东京６月２７日电  记者于青报道：日中经济贸易中心理事长吉泽宏始在６月２２日的周刊《业务联络》报上发表文章指出，日本贸易界经过长期艰苦努力，建立了今天的对华经济关系。日中经济关系是日中双方众多人们合作的结晶，是日中双方的宝贵财产。历经数十年的日中贸易历史，也能够经得起今天的考验。
    文章中谈到，新中国建立以来，在北京第一次发布戒严令确是异常事情，这属于中国内政问题，我们的贸易应该继续进行。现在应该强调的是，日本贸易界不能停留在只作买卖的肤浅认识上。中国有巨大的潜在力，无论对日本，还是对亚洲的和平和稳定，是不可替代的邻国。日中关系与欧美和中国的关系不能类比，是难以切断的关系。因此，对于中国不要被一时的现象迷惑，应该立足长远继续工作。
    另据《日本经济新闻》６月２５日报道，松下电器公司社长谷井昭雄说，中国的经济政策不会发生大的变化，实行经济开放政策是历史的必然，对华经济合作不会缩小。由于这次动乱，预定中的北京显像管厂开工日被迫延期。只要中国坚持开放政策，开工日定会到来。现在我们正注视事态发展，研究开工日期。富士通公司社长山本卓真说，富士通公司在北京和上海的工作人员一度回国，返回工作是理所当然的。相信中国今后将继续实行开放政策，我们也将冷静地予以合作。三菱重工公司社长饭田庸太郎说，中国电力严重不足，本公司的立场是，有能发挥作用的事情就尽力合作，没有考虑改变这一姿态。
