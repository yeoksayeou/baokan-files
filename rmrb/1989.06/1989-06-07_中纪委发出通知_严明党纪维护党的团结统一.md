The Central Discipline Inspection Commission has issued a notice on strictly upholding party discipline to maintain party unity.

Recently, a counterrevolutionary riot aimed at overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party of China, overthrowing the socialist system, and subverting the People's Republic occurred in our great capital. The People's Liberation Army's martial law troops, following orders, took decisive measures to crush the riot instigated by a small number of people, achieving an initial victory. The facts have proven that the decisions made by the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission are completely correct. It must be recognized that the political struggle we face is extremely complex. A small number of people continue to create and spread rumors, incite the masses, and stir up trouble between the people and the martial law troops, armed police, and public security officers, engaging in destructive activities such as looting and arson. The situation remains very severe. All levels of party organizations and all Communist Party members must fully understand the arduousness and complexity of this struggle, stand firmly on the front lines of the struggle, and contribute to the complete suppression of the counterrevolutionary riot, the maintenance of stability and unity, and the defense of the achievements of the revolution, construction, and reform. To this end, the Central Discipline Inspection Commission requires all levels of party organizations and all Communist Party members:

1. In this political struggle, strictly adhere to political discipline, and firmly align politically and in action with the Party Central Committee. Seriously study and resolutely implement the Party Central Committee and the State Council's "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Entire Nation" and all directives and orders regarding the suppression of the riot and the stabilization of the situation. Do not believe or spread rumors. Maintain party unity and fully play the role of the party organization as a fortress and the vanguard model role of Communist Party members, organizing and uniting the broad masses of the people to resolutely fight against the small number of people who intentionally create chaos and the counterrevolutionary rioters.

2. Take the lead in maintaining work posts, and maintain normal production, work, and living order. Party organizations must strengthen the education and management of party members. Communist Party members must consciously abide by party discipline and model the execution of national laws and regulations, fighting against all illegal activities that disrupt production, work, and social order.

3. Actively support and cooperate with the People's Liberation Army, armed police, and public security officers in performing their sacred duties as stipulated by the constitution and laws, providing convenience and creating conditions for them to carry out their missions.

4. Strictly uphold party discipline and severely punish Communist Party members who engage in looting and arson during the counterrevolutionary riot. Those who plan, organize, and lead riot activities will be expelled from the party once found. Those who violate the criminal law will be severely punished by judicial organs according to the law.

5. All levels of discipline inspection organs and all discipline inspection cadres must stand firm in this sharp political struggle, distinguish right from wrong, pass the test, fully play their functional role, and with a high sense of political responsibility and strong party principles, resolutely uphold and seriously implement party discipline. Seriously and responsibly handle the people's complaints and reports, continue to seriously investigate and punish party disciplinary cases, eliminate corrupt elements, purify the party organization, and with practical actions uphold the party's leadership and defend the cause of socialist modernization.
