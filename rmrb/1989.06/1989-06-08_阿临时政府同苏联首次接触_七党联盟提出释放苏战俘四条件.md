Xinhua News Agency, Islamabad, June 7th. Reporter Ren Yujun reports:

The Afghan Interim Government and the Soviet Union held their first contact yesterday at the Pakistani Ministry of Foreign Affairs to discuss the release of Soviet prisoners of war. This was the first time the interim government has engaged with the Soviet side since its establishment.

According to reports, the Soviet delegation consisted of the Soviet ambassador to Pakistan, military attaché, and secretary, while the interim government sent four representatives. The negotiations lasted 45 minutes. According to the interim government's negotiators, this meeting was held at the request of the Soviet side. The Soviet side wanted to know the list of prisoners, their conditions, and the terms for their exchange. According to reports, the interim government proposed four points regarding the prisoner issue:

1. The exchange of prisoners should be conducted as a package deal and not piecemeal to avoid unexpected problems;
2. During the war, over 40,000 Afghans either went missing, were imprisoned, or were killed, and their whereabouts are unknown. The Soviet side should provide information about these Afghans;
3. The interim government should maintain contact with the International Red Cross and arrange for them to meet with the prisoners. The Soviet Union can contact this organization to understand the situation of the prisoners;
4. The interim government disputes the Soviet-provided figure of 313 prisoners, stating that this number is significantly lower than the actual number.

It is reported that the Soviet negotiators agreed to convey the conditions from the Mujahideen side to Moscow and inform the Mujahideen side of the response.

　　阿临时政府同苏联首次接触
    七党联盟提出释放苏战俘四条件
    本报伊斯兰堡６月７日电  记者任毓骏报道：据巴基斯坦《国民报》今天消息，苏联代表团和阿富汗七党联盟临时政府代表团于昨天在巴基斯坦外交部举行了有关释放苏联战俘问题的谈判，这是阿临时政府成立以来第一次与苏联方面接触。
    据报道，参加这次谈判的苏方代表团由苏联驻巴使馆的参赞、武官和秘书等人组成，阿临时政府也派出４名代表，谈判共进行了４５分钟。据临时政府的谈判代表说，这次谈判是应苏方的要求举行的。苏联方面想知道战俘名单、战俘情况以及交换这些战俘的条件。据报道，临时政府就战俘问题提出了４点建议：
    １，交换战俘应以一揽子交易方式进行，不应零敲碎打，以免出现一些意外的问题；
    ２，战争期间，４万余名阿富汗人或失踪、或被监禁、或被杀，这些人下落不明，苏联方面应提供这些阿富汗人的信息；
    ３，临时政府方面和红十字会国际组织保持联系并安排他们和战俘会过面，苏联可与该组织接触并了解战俘情况；
    ４，临时政府对苏联提供的共有３１３名战俘这一数字持异议，这一数字比实际数字要少得多。
    据称，苏方谈判代表同意把游击队方面的条件转达给莫斯科并把其答复告诉游击队方面。
