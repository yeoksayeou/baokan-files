Workers in Hebei Maintain Stability and Production

Xinhua News Agency, June 21st.

The workers in Hebei province have steadfastly maintained their posts and ensured stability and unity, achieving record industrial production in May. The province's industrial output value for May reached 4.548 billion yuan, a 10.7% increase over the same period last year, setting a new historical high.

Since late April, Hebei's industrial production has faced numerous difficulties and disruptions. The provincial government held five different types of meetings to study measures for overcoming these challenges. They urged workers to continue production and work hard, supporting the Party Central Committee's correct decisions. The government also notified various cities and counties to take effective measures to ensure the normal operation of all industrial and mining enterprises.

In Stone City, despite attempts by some individuals to incite workers to strike, the municipal Party committee and government called on the working class to exhibit a sense of ownership and strengthen labor discipline. Simultaneously, the municipal Party committee and government strengthened coordination and logistics, ensuring normal production order. In May, the city's total industrial output value exceeded 1 billion yuan.
