From June 6 to 11, Pakistani Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto made an official visit to the United States, her first visit to this Western country since taking office. Upon her return to Islamabad, Bhutto stated that her visit was "beneficial and fruitful."

During her visit to the U.S., Bhutto and American President George H.W. Bush focused on the Afghanistan issue. Before Bhutto's visit, Bush had stated that the U.S. would fully respect Pakistan's opinions on the Afghanistan issue. In reality, the U.S. sought to use this opportunity to adjust its Afghanistan policy. After the Soviet Union completely withdrew from Afghanistan on February 15, the U.S. and some of its Western allies overestimated the strength of the Afghan Mujahideen, encouraging the seven-party alliance to launch an attack on Jalalabad, aiming to resolve the Afghanistan issue through military means. Due to the Mujahideen's lack of urban combat experience, air power, and unified command, the attack on Jalalabad stalled, leading to a military stalemate. This visit helped Pakistan and the U.S. reach a relatively consistent opinion on politically resolving the Afghanistan issue. Both sides agreed that "a politically representative, non-aligned government that coexists peacefully with neighboring countries should be established in Afghanistan to replace the current illegal regime in Kabul." This is the first time the U.S. has publicly stated that the future Afghan government should have broad "representativeness," but it still insists on the removal of Najibullah.

Bhutto also discussed the Afghanistan issue with United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar. Both sides expressed their willingness to make efforts to politically resolve the Afghanistan issue. They also discussed how to ensure that UN aid reaches Afghan refugees directly and how to establish UN-managed refugee camps within Afghanistan to accommodate new refugees caused by the civil war.

Local media believe that Bhutto's visit to the U.S. has brought new opportunities for a political resolution to the Afghanistan issue. If, as she hopes, the Afghanistan issue can be resolved politically within a few months, this will be a blessing for South Asia, especially for the Afghan people.

On the issue of economic relations between Pakistan and the U.S., Bhutto signed three agreements with the U.S.: the U.S. will provide $280 million in aid to Pakistan to promote the development of primary education, especially women's education; another $80 million in aid to improve the quality of higher education in Pakistan; and $105 million in aid to help Pakistan complete its plan to provide housing for the poor. These aids are all part of the U.S.'s six-year aid package to Pakistan, which began in 1988 and totals $2.28 billion.

Bhutto also held talks with the Pentagon. The U.S. Department of Defense agreed to sell Pakistan 64 Standard anti-aircraft missiles worth $40 million and 64 MK-46 shipborne torpedoes worth $28 million. The main purpose of Bhutto's contact with the Pentagon was to push for the sale of 60 advanced F-16 fighter jets to Pakistan, a deal worth $1.4 billion. A U.S. State Department official stated that a decision to approve this weapons deal would be announced soon.

Bhutto visited the U.S. after her government announced the new fiscal year budget on June 3. The substantial economic and military aid from the U.S. will help the National Assembly pass the new budget more smoothly and help the People's Party government improve its credibility and stability.

　　贝·布托的美国之行
    本报记者  任毓骏
    从６月６日到１１日，巴基斯坦总理贝·布托对美国进行了为期６天的正式访问，这是她就任总理以来第一次访问这个西方大国。贝·布托在返抵伊斯兰堡时称，她的这次访问是“有益的和富有成果的”。
    访美期间，贝·布托和美国总统布什重点谈了阿富汗问题。贝·布托赴美之前，布什曾说，在阿富汗问题上，美国将充分尊重巴基斯坦的意见。实际上，美国想借此机会调整其阿富汗政策。苏联于今年２月１５日完全从阿富汗撤军后，美国及其一些西方盟国过高估计了阿富汗游击队的实力，鼓励七党联盟对贾拉拉巴德发动进攻，想以军事手段解决阿富汗问题。由于游击队方面缺乏攻城经验，没有空中力量，再加之缺乏统一指挥，致使贾城久攻不下，军事解决陷入僵局。这次访问使巴美在政治解决阿富汗问题上取得了较为一致的意见，双方都认为，“应通过政治方式，鼓励在阿富汗建立一个有代表性的不结盟的与邻邦和睦共处的政府”，“以取代目前喀布尔的非法政权”。这是美国第一次公开表示未来的阿富汗政府应有广泛的“代表性”，但仍坚持纳吉布拉下台。
    贝·布托还就阿富汗问题和联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔举行了会谈，双方都表示要在政治解决阿富汗问题上尽各自的努力。双方还讨论了如何使联合国的援助能直接送到阿富汗难民手中以及在阿富汗境内建立由联合国管理的难民营以接纳内战造成的新难民等问题。
    此间舆论认为，贝·布托的美国之行给政治解决阿富汗问题带来了新的契机。如能像她希望的那样，在几个月内使阿富汗问题得到政治解决，这将是南亚地区，特别是阿富汗人民的福音。
    在巴美经济关系问题上，贝·布托同美国签署了３项协议：美国向巴基斯坦提供２．８亿美元援助，促进巴基斯坦发展初等教育，特别是妇女教育；另提供０．８亿美元援助，以提高巴高等教育质量；１．０５亿美元的援助，帮助巴基斯坦完成为穷人提供住房的计划。这些援助都包括在美国为巴基斯坦提供的从１９８８年开始的６年一揽子经援计划之中，这项援助共计２２．８亿美元。
    贝·布托还和五角大楼进行了会谈，美国国防部同意向巴基斯坦出售价值４０００万美元的６４枚标准防空导弹和价值２．８千万美元的６４枚ＭＫ—４６舰载鱼雷。贝·布托和五角大楼接触的最主要目的是促使其同意向巴出售６０架先进的Ｆ—１６战斗机，这笔交易高达１４亿美元。美国国务院官员称，同意这笔武器交易的决定将在近期内宣布。
    贝·布托是在她的政府于６月３日宣布新年度财政预算后访问美国的。美国的数量可观的经援和军援，将有助于国民议会较顺利地通过新预算，也有助于人民党政府提高威信和稳定地位。　　　　　（本报伊斯兰堡６月１２日电）
