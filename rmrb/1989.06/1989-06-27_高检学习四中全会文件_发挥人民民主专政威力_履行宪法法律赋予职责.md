The Supreme People's Procuratorate began transmitting the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee to party members and cadres at the bureau level and above on June 26. Procurator-General Liu Fuzhi presided over the meeting, requiring the procuratorial organs and all procuratorial personnel to seriously study and resolutely implement the resolutions of the Fourth Plenary Session.

Participants unanimously expressed their support for the decision of the Fourth Plenary Session to remove Zhao Ziyang from his positions as General Secretary and other posts, firmly supporting the new leadership of the Party Central Committee with Jiang Zemin as the General Secretary. They also expressed their support for the high evaluation of the outstanding role played by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, with Deng Xiaoping as the representative, in stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Everyone unanimously stated that they would respond to the call of the plenary session, unite more closely around the Party Central Committee, work together, strive hard, overcome difficulties on the road ahead, and continue to firmly adhere to the four cardinal principles, adhere to reform and opening up, and push forward the modernization of Chinese socialism. They must fully exert the power of the people's democratic dictatorship, perform the duties conferred by the constitution and laws on the procuratorial organs, and do a good job in procuratorial work.

Liu Fuzhi said that recently, Comrade Xiaoping's important speech is a guiding document for the work of the whole Party and is also the guiding principle for procuratorial work in the coming long period. We must seriously study Comrade Xiaoping's important speech, study the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session, and unify the work of the procuratorial organs, the thoughts, and actions of procuratorial personnel with Comrade Xiaoping's speech and the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee. In the study, we must link it with the actual situation of thoughts and work, clearly recognize the nature and serious harm of Comrade Zhao Ziyang's mistakes, and unswervingly implement the basic line of the Thirteenth National Congress, which is to take socialist economic construction as the center, adhere to the four cardinal principles, and adhere to reform and opening up. We must consciously carry out the policy of opposing bourgeois liberalization and combating corruption to the end.

Liu Fuzhi said that the Fourth Plenary Session proposed that the current task is to focus on four major issues, which is very wise and in line with the hearts of the Party and the people. In focusing on these four major issues, the procuratorial organs bear important responsibilities. Currently, procuratorial organs at all levels must stand firm, be clear-cut, and actively participate in the thorough investigation and resolute suppression of counter-revolutionary rebels, severely cracking down on counter-revolutionary rebels and other serious criminal elements in accordance with the law; continue to firmly combat bribery and embezzlement as the first priority in combating economic crimes, and as the key work of the procuratorial organs, focus on investigating and prosecuting major cases of bribery and embezzlement, and make due contributions in combating corruption.

    据新华社北京６月２７日电  最高人民检察院自６月２６日起，向处以上党员干部传达了党的十三届四中全会精神。刘复之检察长主持了会议，他要求检察机关和全体检察干警认真学习和坚决贯彻四中全会的决议。
    与会同志一致表示坚决拥护四中全会撤销赵紫阳同志的总书记及其他职务的决定，坚决拥护以江泽民同志为总书记的党中央新的领导集体，坚决拥护全会对以邓小平同志为代表的老一辈无产阶级革命家在制止动乱、平息反革命暴乱中发挥的杰出作用的高度评价。大家一致表示，一定要响应全会号召，更加紧密地团结在党中央周围，同心同德，艰苦奋斗，克服前进道路上的困难，满怀信心地继续坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，把我国社会主义现代化建设推向前进。要充分发挥人民民主专政的威力，履行宪法和法律赋予检察机关的职责，做好检察工作。
    刘复之说，最近小平同志的重要讲话是全党工作的纲领性文件，也是检察工作今后一个长时期的指导方针。我们要认真学习小平同志的重要讲话，学习四中全会精神，把检察机关的工作、检察人员的思想和行动统一到小平同志的讲话上来，统一到十三届四中全会精神上来，在学习中，要联系思想和工作实际，认清赵紫阳同志错误的性质和严重危害，坚定不移地贯彻执行党的十三大制定的以社会主义经济建设为中心、坚持四项基本原则、坚持改革开放的基本路线，自觉地把反对资产阶级自由化和惩治腐败的方针贯彻到底。
    刘复之说，四中全会提出当前要抓好四件大事，是非常英明的，是合乎党心、民心的。在抓好四件大事中，检察机关担负着重要的责任。当前，各级检察机关要立场坚定，旗帜鲜明地积极参加彻底清查、坚决镇压反革命暴乱分子的斗争，依法严厉打击反革命暴乱分子和其他严重刑事犯罪分子；继续坚定不移地把反贪污、受贿列为打击经济犯罪的第一位工作，作为检察机关的工作重点，抓紧查办重大的贪污、受贿案件，在惩治腐败中作出应有的贡献。
