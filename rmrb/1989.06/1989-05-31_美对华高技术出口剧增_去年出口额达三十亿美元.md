Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 31st.

The United States' high-tech exports to China have seen a dramatic increase, with last year's export value reaching $3 billion.

According to a report by the United States New Agency, an official from the U.S. Department of Commerce responsible for approving export licenses to China said that the number of applications for exporting high-tech goods to China in 1988 reached 6,900, with an export value of $3.6 billion. Among these, 6,200 applications were approved, accounting for 91% of the total, with an export value of $3 billion. Of the applications that were not approved, only 1.25% were rejected, while the rest were returned either because they did not require an export license or because the application lacked necessary information.

An official from the Department of Commerce responsible for issuing licenses said that the types of advanced technology products approved for export to China are diverse, including certain digital control devices, the latest components for numerical control machine tools, and precision testing equipment. In addition, the United States exported to China large mainframe computers, some semiconductor manufacturing equipment, and scientific instruments.

In the field of high-tech exports, the U.S. Department of Commerce classifies China in the "V" group, which includes most friendly countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe.

　　美对华高技术出口剧增
    去年出口额达三十亿美元
    新华社北京５月３１日电  据美新署报道，美国商务部一位负责审批对中国的出口许可证的官员说，美国对中国的高技术出口急剧增加。
    商务部负责发放出口许可证的局长贝尔德最近说，１９８８年申请向中国出口高技术商品的报告达６９００份，出口额为３６亿美元。其中获得批准的有６２００份，占总数的９１％，出口额为３０亿美元。在未获批准的申请书中只有１．２５％被否决，其余被退回的或是根本无须出口许可证，或是申请报告缺少必要的资料。
    商务部一位发放许可证的官员说，获准向中国出口的各类先进技术商品的种类很多，其中包括某些数字控制装置、数控机床和精密检测设备的最新部件。此外，美国出口中国的商品还包括某些大型计算机主机、一些半导体生产设备和科学仪器。
    在高技术出口方面，美国商务部把中国编在“Ｖ”组，列入这组的国家包括亚洲、非洲和欧洲的大部分友好国家。
