Currently, in the computer field, "computer viruses" are causing widespread alarm. Any computer, large or small, once infected by a "computer virus," will have all the data in its database turned into a blank. Moreover, its transmission is very rapid, spreading through computer networks or the exchange of computer disks, and can infect tens of thousands of computer systems in an instant, causing them to lose all their memory and data.

The consequences are unimaginable. If a stock exchange's computer is infected by a virus, all stock trading records will be destroyed, and daily transactions worth millions of dollars will be impossible to reconcile. If the computer system controlling the launch of nuclear missiles at the Pentagon in the United States is infected, all its memory and data will be erased. These missiles, out of control, could be launched indiscriminately, potentially triggering a global nuclear war.

Computer viruses have already wreaked havoc in the United States. An American economic journalist had spent half a year collecting various data and interview content, all of which was entered into the newspaper's computer system and made into a computer disk. When she was ready to write her report and inserted the disk into the computer, the data on the screen appeared for only a second or two before turning into a blank screen, accompanied by a screeching sound. The entire newsroom's computers quickly exhibited the same problem, plunging the newsroom into chaos. Computer experts suspected the problem was with the journalist's disk. This virus-infected disk had 360 data tracks, and the experts only found the virus after checking to the innermost track.

In early September of last year, a computer at a U.S. trading company suddenly lost its memory, and all the data in its database was erased, including the company's 168,000 sales commission records. It was later discovered that a dismissed computer programmer had planted a "computer virus" in the system, connected to a timer, which activated after he left the job. The court ordered the programmer to pay $12,000 in compensation and may sentence him to 10 years in prison.

The infectious power of computer viruses is even more frightening than AIDS. Computer viruses can spread through computer networks to hundreds of kilometers away. The computer system at the aforementioned newspaper, through network connections, destroyed 150,000 computer disks across the United States.

Another type of virus called "Scoop" first appeared in a computer service center in Dallas. It quickly spread to large companies like Boeing and eventually infected the computer systems of NASA, the IRS, and the House of Representatives. Unverified reports suggest that computer viruses have infiltrated the FBI and the CIA. According to statistics, there are about 3,000 computer consulting clubs in the United States, and their members, unknowingly, become carriers of computer viruses when exchanging disks.

There are currently about 25 known types of computer viruses, with an average of one or two new viruses appearing each week. Some viruses are prank-like, such as making the machine emit strange noises to startle you, while others cause temporary malfunctions. The most serious ones destroy the computer's data.

Who is behind the creation of these viruses? Opinions vary. Experts point out that computer viruses are actually the work of some American teenagers and young adults in their twenties who are computer "prodigies." From a young age, they enjoy playing with computers, initially writing prank programs to tease their friends and have fun. Later, they expanded their pranks by hiding viruses in disks and exchanging them with unsuspecting users, spreading the viruses. This prank quickly caught on, and various types of viruses began to appear.

General measures to prevent computer viruses include not buying disks from unknown sources, not exchanging disks with others, and not allowing strangers to touch the computer. Companies with computer systems do not easily allow outsiders near their computers and pay special attention to the actions of computer operators. However, these measures can only serve as passive defenses.

Recently, a U.S. court sentenced a person who spread computer viruses to a heavy penalty, which had a certain positive effect in curbing the spread of viruses. Forty-eight states in the United States have passed laws prohibiting malicious computer sabotage. However, most computer viruses have timers and only cause damage after a certain period, making them difficult to trace and investigate.

There are now "computer vaccines" on the market. These vaccines set up protective programs in areas where viruses are most likely to hide, such as certain software control sections. When an unknown signal attempts to breach these areas, the "computer vaccine" will block it and issue a warning signal to notify the computer owner. However, the areas where computer viruses attack are not fixed, so the effectiveness of "computer vaccines" still needs to be further expanded and improved.

If a computer is infected, a special program can be used to find and eliminate the virus. The simplest method is to turn off the computer, erase all memory and disks, and rebuild the database. However, you must use new disks from the original manufacturer and scan them for any strange signals before using them.

Of course, if the virus programmer tries every means to break these preventive measures, it will be difficult to defend against. In summary, preventing viruses from infecting computers is a formidable battle that cannot be underestimated.

### 防范电脑“病毒”刻不容缓

　　防范电脑“病毒”刻不容缓
    泰然
    目前，在电脑领域内，“电脑病毒”令人闻之色变。任何大小电脑，一旦被“电脑病毒”侵入，电脑资料库内的所有资料都会变成一片空白。而且它的传染很迅速，通过电脑联线或互相交换电脑磁盘，就能使数以万计的电脑系统在一瞬间失去所有记忆与资料。
    　　　　后果不堪设想
    证券交易所的电脑被“病毒”侵入，所有股票买卖纪录便毁于一旦，每天数以千万元计的交易额将无从对帐。如果主管核导弹发射的美国五角大楼的电脑系统遭到“病毒”感染，它的全部记忆与资料将被消灭，这些核导弹在失去控制的情况下将有可能无端发射，甚至引发世界核大战。
    “电脑病毒”已肆虐美国。美国一名经济记者，把半年内收集的各种资料、访问内容全部输入报社的电脑系统，制成一个电脑磁盘。在她准备写报道，而把磁盘插入电脑时，电脑屏幕上显示的资料只出现了一两秒钟，接着就成为一片空白，并发出一阵尖叫声。全报社的电脑都很快出现同样情况，整个报社陷入一片混乱。电脑技术专家怀疑问题就出在这位记者的磁盘上。这个感染了“病毒”的磁盘共有３６０圈数据线，技术专家一直检查到最内圈才找到了它。
    去年９月初，美国一家贸易公司的电脑突然丧失记忆，资料库中的资料全被洗掉，其中包括该公司１６．８万项销售佣金资料。后查出是一位被裁减的电脑程序设计师，在电脑系统内“埋设”了一个“电脑病毒”，并连通定时装置，直至他离职后才发作。法院已判该设计师赔偿１．２万美元，并可能判处１０年徒刑。
    　　　　传染力比艾滋病还可怕
    电脑“病毒”可以经由电脑联线传到数百公里之外。前面所提到的那家报社的电脑系统通过联线毁掉了美国各地１５万个电脑磁盘。
    另外一种名叫“史可尔”的电脑“病毒”，最初出现在达拉斯一家苹果电脑服务站内，很快就蔓延到波音等大公司，最后连美国航宇局、税务局和众议院的电脑系统也全被“病毒”侵入。未经证实的报道说，电脑“病毒”已入侵联邦调查局和中央情报局。据统计，美国约有３０００家电脑咨询俱乐部，其会员在交换磁盘中，不知不觉地充当了电脑病毒的传播者。
    目前已发现的电脑“病毒”大约有２５类，平均每星期都会冒出一两种“新病毒”。有些“病毒”是玩笑性质的，比如使机器发出一些怪声，吓你一跳，有些则造成暂时故障，最严重的是毁掉电脑的资料。
    谁是制作“病毒”的罪魁祸首？众说纷纭。据专家们指出，电脑“病毒”实际上是美国一些十几岁到二十来岁的电脑“神童”想出来的。他们从小喜欢玩电脑，最初只是写些恶作剧的程序整整朋友，开开玩笑，后来则把玩笑扩大，把“病毒”藏在磁盘中，跟不知情的使用者交换磁盘片，把“病毒”传送出去。这种恶作剧方式很快引起了仿效，于是各种各样的“病毒”不断出现。
    　　　　防范办法效果难定
    一般人对电脑病毒采取了下列防范措施：如不买来历不明的磁盘，不和别人交换磁盘，更不让陌生人接触电脑。配有电脑系统的公司则不轻易让外人接近公司电脑，对电脑操作人员的一举一动也要特别注意。但这些办法只能起消极防范的作用。
    最近，美国法院对一位散布电脑“病毒”的人判处重刑，对遏制电脑病毒起了一定的积极作用。美国已有４８个州通过法律，禁止恶意破坏电脑活动。但是，一般“电脑病毒”都连有定时装置，要在一定时间后才能发生破坏作用，不容易寻迹追查。
    目前已有“电脑疫苗”上市。它是在病毒最容易藏身的某些软件控制部位设下保护程序，当来历不明的信号要突破这些部位时，“电脑疫苗”便会阻挡，发出警告信号，通知电脑主人。不过，电脑病毒侵袭的部位并不固定，所以“电脑疫苗”的作用还有待进一步扩大与提高。
    电脑一旦受侵害，也可以使用一种特别程序找出“病毒”，加以消除。最简单的方法是把电脑关掉，消除所有记忆和电脑磁盘，重新建立资料库。但一定要使用原厂出品的新磁盘，并在使用它之前先扫描一遍，看磁盘中是否藏有奇怪的信号。
    当然，如果病毒程序的设计者想尽办法来破解这些预防措施，那就会使你防不胜防。总的说来，预防“病毒”对电脑的侵害已是一场不可小视的攻坚战。
