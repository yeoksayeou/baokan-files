The basic meaning of insurance is to transfer risks to the insurer, who accumulates the uncertain losses caused by these risks and converts them into definite premiums, collected from all policyholders. When a loss occurs, the insurer pays the agreed compensation.

The insurance industry in Western countries has developed rapidly alongside the high degree of socialization of their economies, and related insurance legislation and systems have become increasingly refined.

	Four Types of Insurance Companies

	In summary, today's Western insurance companies can be roughly divided into four types. Private insurance companies dominate the insurance market. These companies are purely commercial in nature, so in choosing risks, they prioritize operational stability. They compete with each other in business, vying for customers with high-quality service. Currently, the largest private insurance organization in the world is the Lloyd's of London. Government-operated insurance companies are generally established to support the implementation of certain government policies. For example, they provide unemployment insurance and labor compensation insurance to the unemployed, injured, or those who have lost their ability to work. Some are established to support the development of certain industries and enhance their international competitiveness. Insurance companies jointly operated by the government and private sector aim to implement certain social insurance plans. For instance, in the United States, according to the 1965 legislation, the elderly health care program jointly operated by the government, life insurance companies, Blue Cross, and Blue Shield falls into this category. Mutual aid cooperative insurance companies are usually called mutual insurance societies or insurance cooperatives, and are often small-scale enterprises or mutual aid cooperative organizations for certain industries or regions. Examples include Japan's Fire Mutual Aid Society, Forest Mutual Insurance Society, and Fishermen's Insurance Society.

	Legislative Management

	Western countries place great importance on strengthening the management of the insurance industry through legislation. For many years, Britain has insisted on strengthening insurance legislation and management. The 1906 British Marine Insurance Act has had a significant impact on the global insurance industry. In 1974, Britain enacted the Insurance Companies Act, which stipulates that insurers must distinguish between assets and liabilities related to long-term business and those related to general business. The act also stipulates that the Department of Trade is the highest management authority for the British insurance industry.

	The United States has federal and state insurance laws. The former includes the McCarran-Ferguson Act, while the latter includes the New York State Insurance Law and the California State Law. According to the McCarran-Ferguson Act, states have the legislative authority to manage the insurance industry. However, if state laws are insufficient or non-existent, the federal government has jurisdiction.

	Japan's insurance legislation is relatively complete, including the Commercial Code, Insurance Business Law, Insurance Business Control Law, Non-Foreign Insurers Law, Foreign Insurers Law, and the Shipowners Mutual Insurance Society Law. Japan manages insurance institutions by classification: private companies and their agents are supervised and managed by the Ministry of Finance; unemployment insurance and labor compensation insurance are managed by the Ministry of Labor; mutual aid cooperative insurance societies are jointly managed by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry; forestry and fisheries mutual insurance societies are managed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Forestry, and Fisheries.

	Positive Role

	Insurance companies in Western countries actively undertake the risks of the insured, reducing the losses of the victims. They generally convert only 5% of the insurance premiums into profits. After deducting various operational expenses, the rest is used as compensation funds. Some insurance businesses, such as motor vehicle insurance and crop insurance, have compensation rates that even exceed 100%. Insurance investments have become the source of compensation funds and profits for insurance companies. Generally, companies set aside 40% of the insurance premiums as technical reserves, with the remainder used as investment funds. According to statistics from a authoritative magazine of the Swiss Reinsurance Company, the current per capita insurance premium income in the United States is nearly $1,000, with the total annual insurance investment income reaching over $100 billion, accounting for 7.23% of the national GDP.

	In recent years, insurers in Western countries have increasingly recognized the role of disaster prevention and loss reduction in insurance operations. Insurance companies take a series of measures to reduce the likelihood and extent of risks. For example, installing magnetic dust collectors in textile workshops can reduce friction from dust in the air, helping to prevent fires. Regularly checking the safety indicators of insured units has become an effective measure for insurance companies to prevent disasters and reduce losses. To this end, insurance companies employ a group of specialized engineering and technical personnel who frequently visit insured units to explain risk management knowledge, promoting society's disaster prevention and reduction efforts.

　　西方的保险业
    方春银
    保险的基本含义是，将危险转嫁给保险人，而保险人积聚因该危险而导致的不定损失，并使之转化为一定的保费，向全体投保人员收取。当损失发生时，保险人付给约定的补偿。
    西方国家的保险业随着其经济的高度社会化发展而日益发达，有关保险的立法和制度也日臻完善。
    　　　　四种类型
    概括起来，当今西方的保险公司大致有四种类型。私人保险公司在保险市场中占绝对优势。这种公司是纯商业性的，所以在风险的选择上，更多地是从经营稳定性出发的。它们在业务上相互竞争，以优质服务争取客户。目前，世界上最大的私人保险组织是英国的劳合社。政府经营的保险公司一般是为配合政府某项政策的实施而建立的。如向失业人员、受伤人员或失去劳动能力的人提供失业保险及劳工补偿保险等等。有的则是为支持某些行业的发展，加强其国际竞争力。政府与私人联合办的保险公司旨在实施某种社会保险计划。美国根据１９６５年的立法，由政府与寿险公司、蓝十字、蓝盾共同兴办的老年保健医疗就属于这一类。互助合作性的保险公司通常称为相互保险社，又叫保险合作社，多为小型企业或某行业某地区的互助合作性组织。如日本的火灾互助合作社、森林相互保险社、捕鱼者保险社等。
    　　　　立法管理
    西方国家重视通过立法来加强对保险业的管理。多年来，英国始终坚持加强保险立法和管理，１９０６年制订的英国海上保险法对世界保险业有很大的影响。１９７４年，英国又制订了保险公司法。该法规定，保险人必须把与长期业务有关的资产和负债，同与一般业务相联系的资产和负债区别开来。该法还规定，贸易部为英国保险业的最高管理机构。
    美国的保险法分联邦法和州法，前者如麦卡伦—弗格森法，后者如纽约州保险法和加利福尼亚州法。根据麦卡伦—弗格森法的规定，各州对保险业的管理享有立法权。但如州法无规定或规定不充分者，联邦政府有管辖权。
    日本的保险立法比较完备，有日本商法、保险业法、保险展业控制法、非外国保险人法、外国保险人法以及船舶所有人相互保险社法等等。日本对保险机构实行分类管理：私人公司及其代理人由大藏省监督管理；失业保险、劳工补偿保险由劳动省管理；互助合作性质的保险合作社由大藏省和通产省联合管理；森林、渔业相互保险社则由农林省管理。
    　　　　积极作用
    西方国家的保险公司主动承担了受保人的风险，减少了受害者的损失。它们一般仅有５％的保险费转化为利润。除去各种经营开支，其余都用作赔付基金。有些保险业务如机动车辆保险、农作物保险的赔付率甚至超过百分之百。保险投资就成了保险公司赔付基金和利润的来源。一般公司提留４０％的保险费作技术准备金，余者作为投资基金。据瑞士再保险公司的一家权威杂志统计，美国目前的人均保险费收入近１０００美元，全美年保险总投资收入达１００多亿美元，占国民生产总值的７．２３％。
    近年来，西方国家的保险人越来越认识到防灾防损在保险经营中的作用。保险公司通过一系列措施，减少险情发生的可能性和损失程度。比如，在纺织车间中安装磁性吸尘器可以减少空气中尘粒的磨擦，有助于避免火灾的发生。定期检查受保单位的安全指标，成了保险公司防灾防损的有力措施。为此，保险公司都拥有一批有专长的工程技术人员，经常到受保单位讲解风险管理知识，促进了社会防灾防损的工作。
