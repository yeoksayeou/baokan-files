In the months of April, May, and June, when the social environment was turbulent, the urban deposits of the Henan Industrial and Commercial Bank continued to show a significant growth trend. By June 15, the deposit balance had exceeded 10 billion yuan, completing 110% of the annual target.

People have noticed that during May and June, when some cities in Henan also experienced disturbances, the more than 20,000 employees of the Henan Industrial and Commercial Bank worked hard to overcome the disruptions and difficulties caused by the chaotic social order. They continued to maintain their work positions. Under the premise of ensuring bank safety, there were no savings institutions that closed their doors for business, and the freedom of the public to withdraw money was guaranteed.

　　河南工商行存款超百亿
    本报郑州６月１７日电  记者李杰、李而亮报道：在社会环境动荡的４、５、６月份，河南工商银行城镇存款数额却保持着大幅度增长的势头。截至６月１５日，存款余额超１００亿元大关，已完成全年任务的１１０％。
    人们注意到，在５、６月份，正当河南一些城市也一度出现动乱现象时，河南省工商银行２万多职工努力克服社会秩序混乱带来的干扰和困难，一直坚持工作岗位。在保证银行安全的前提下，无一储蓄机构关门停业，保证群众自由支取。
