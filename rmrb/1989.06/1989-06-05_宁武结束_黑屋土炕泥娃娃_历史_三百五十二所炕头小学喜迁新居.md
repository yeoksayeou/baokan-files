	Ningwu County has ended the history of "dark rooms, earthen beds, and mud dolls." 352 schools have moved into new premises.

	According to a report from the Shanxi Daily, on the eve of June 1st, the sound of firecrackers echoed at the Qian Shihu Lake Primary School in Ningwu County. Nearly 30 teachers and students joyfully moved into the bright new school buildings. With this, Ningwu County's 352 earthen-bed schools have ended their history of "dark rooms, earthen beds, and mud dolls."

	Ningwu County is located in the deep mountains of western Shanxi, with deep valleys and steep slopes, and harsh natural conditions. Culture and economy have long been backward. Of the county's 460 primary and secondary schools, most are located in remote mountain areas, with very poor educational conditions. Since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, the county has taken education as the foundation for poverty alleviation and prosperity. From 1983 to 1988, the county's financial department invested a total of 16.367 million yuan to improve educational conditions, accounting for 22.57% of the total financial expenditure. From 1983 to 1988, the total amount of social fundraising reached over 4.51 million yuan, and 229 new primary and secondary schools were built.

　　宁武结束“黑屋土炕泥娃娃”历史
    三百五十二所炕头小学喜迁新居
    本报讯  据《山西日报》报道：“六一”前夕，宁武县前石湖小学响起一阵热烈的鞭炮声，近３０名师生兴高彩烈地搬进了明亮的新校舍。至此，宁武县的３５２所炕泥小学结束了“黑屋土炕泥娃娃”的历史。
    宁武县地处晋西北山区，沟深坡陡，自然条件恶劣，文化、经济一直很落后。全县４６０所中小学大部分分布在深山僻壤之中，办学条件十分简陋。十一届三中全会以来，该县把兴学育人作为治穷致富的基础来抓，从１９８３年至１９８８年，县财政累计投资１６３６．７万元用于改善办学条件，占财政总支出的２２．５７％；从１９８３年至１９８８年６年时间社会集资总额达４５１万多元，共新建中小学２２９所。
