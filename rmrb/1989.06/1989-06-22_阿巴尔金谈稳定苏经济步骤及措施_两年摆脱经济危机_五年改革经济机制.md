Soviet economist Abalkin said today in an interview with a Soviet Central Television reporter that the Soviet Union must overcome the economic crisis in two years and then use five years to implement a thorough reform of the entire economic mechanism.

Abalkin has been nominated as Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers and Chairman of the State Economic Reform Commission. He said that the main task of the commission he will lead is to coordinate efforts to fundamentally reform the Soviet economy and overcome the situation where departments act independently.

He proposed four measures to stabilize the Soviet economy: normalize the financial credit system; formulate anti-monopoly action plans; abandon the old practice of focusing solely on total output indicators in planning work; and use economic methods to manage the economy, shifting from centralized allocation to economic units raising funds on their own.

Abalkin believes that there is no panacea to immediately improve the economic situation at present. It is necessary to comprehensively solve economic problems and rebuild a complete operating system.

    两年摆脱经济危机  五年改革经济机制
    新华社莫斯科6月21日电  苏联经济学家阿巴尔金今天对苏联中央电视台记者发表谈话时说，苏联必须在2年内摆脱经济危机，再用5年时间对整个经济机制实施深刻改革。
    阿巴尔金已被提名为苏联部长会议副主席兼国家经济改革委员会主席。他说，他将领导的委员会的主要任务是，协调在根本改革苏联经济方面所作的努力，克服部门各自为政的状况。
    他提出了稳定苏联经济的4项措施：使金融信贷体制正常化；制订反垄断行动计划；放弃计划工作中只顾总产值指标的老办法；用经济方法管理经济，变集中调拨分配为经济单位自筹资金。
    阿巴尔金认为，目前不存在即刻改善经济状况的灵丹妙药，必须综合解决经济问题，重新建立完整的经营体系。
