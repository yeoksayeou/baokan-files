The Fifth International AIDS Conference concluded on the afternoon of June 9 in Montreal, Canada. The conference, jointly organized by the World Health Organization and the Canadian government, attracted over 11,000 delegates from more than 80 countries. Approximately 600 people delivered speeches at around 200 sessions, and the conference received over 6,000 papers.

A notable feature of this conference was the increased attention given to the AIDS problem in developing countries. Officials from the World Health Organization and many delegates expressed serious concern over the spread of AIDS in third-world countries and its social and economic impacts.

The conference also invited Zambian President Kenneth Kaunda to deliver a keynote speech at the opening ceremony. Kaunda's own family has been affected by the disease, with one of his sons succumbing to AIDS in 1986.

The most pressing issue at this conference was the lack of breakthroughs in AIDS research. Currently, the primary treatment available is a drug called AZT, which can only alleviate symptoms and extend life but cannot cure the disease.

According to the latest statistics from the World Health Organization, by June 1 of this year, the global number of reported AIDS cases had reached 157,191. The actual number of infected individuals is estimated to be around 500,000, with approximately 5 million people carrying the HIV virus, which can develop into AIDS. If this trend continues, the situation in the 1990s will be even more severe. By the year 2000, the number of people carrying the HIV virus is expected to be three times higher than in the 1980s, and the number of AIDS patients is projected to be nine times higher.

Many speakers at the conference called for everyone, especially AIDS patients and those infected with the HIV virus, to consider the well-being of society as a whole. They urged individuals to voluntarily undergo blood tests, seek treatment, and change their sexual behaviors to prevent the spread of the disease.

### 第五届国际艾滋病大会闭幕

　　第五届国际艾滋病大会闭幕
    新华社渥太华６月１０日电  （记者袁荣生）规模空前的第５届国际艾滋病大会已于６月９日下午在加拿大的蒙特利尔结束。
    这次大会由世界卫生组织和加拿大政府共同举办，８０多个国家的１．１万名代表参加了会议，６００多人在约２００次的大小会议上作了发言。大会收到的论文达６０００篇之多。
    这次大会的一个显著特点就是发展中国家的艾滋病问题第一次得到重视。从世界卫生组织的官员到许多与会代表，都对第三世界国家艾滋病的蔓延和造成的社会、经济影响表示严重关切。
    大会还专门邀请赞比亚总统卡翁达到开幕式上作主要讲话。卡翁达本人的家庭就是这一疾病的受害者，他的一个儿子于１９８６年被艾滋病夺去了生命。
    在本届大会上，人们最关心的艾滋病研究仍无突破性的报告。目前世界上主要用的是一种叫作ＡＺＴ的口服药，但它只能减缓症状、延长寿命，不能根治此病。
    世界卫生组织的最新统计材料表明，到今年６月１日，全世界已报告的艾滋病患者达１５７１９１人；实际患者人数约５０万；至于带有ＨＩＶ病毒的人，估计已有５００万之多。ＨＩＶ病毒会发展成为艾滋病。如果按照这种速度发展下去，９０年代的情况将会更加严重。到２０００年，带ＨＩＶ病毒的人将为８０年代的３倍，艾滋病患者将为８０年代的９倍。
    因此许多发言者呼吁，每个人，特别是艾滋病患者和受ＨＩＶ病毒感染的人，要为整个社会着想，主动接受血液检查、接受治疗、改变自己的性行为，防止此病蔓延。
