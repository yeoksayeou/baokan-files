The Sri Lankan Tamil Eelam Liberation Tigers Organization announced on June 27 that it has decided to halt hostilities against the government, and all issues will be resolved through negotiations and discussions.

The Sri Lankan government welcomed the organization's decision today and announced that it would also stop all hostile activities against the organization. Thus, the six-year-long state of hostility between the two sides has ended, and they have agreed to a ceasefire.

The Tamil Eelam Liberation Tigers Organization is the strongest Tamil armed group in Sri Lanka. Since 1983, it has been fighting against the central government for independence in the eastern and northern parts of the country. In 1987, the Indian military entered Sri Lanka to disarm the Tamil forces, and the organization engaged in guerrilla warfare with the Indian troops. Early this year, Sri Lankan President Premadasa demanded the withdrawal of Indian troops and decided to resolve domestic issues independently. On April 26, the Tiger Liberation Organization accepted the president's invitation, and both sides began negotiations while the organization declared a ceasefire with the government forces.

After negotiations, both sides agreed that all groups should unite around the president to ensure the withdrawal of Indian troops; all groups and organizations should resolve all issues through consultation without external interference.

The Indian Foreign Ministry spokesman said today that, according to the Indo-Sri Lankan agreement, the Sri Lankan government cannot reach a ceasefire agreement with the Tamil Eelam Liberation Tigers Organization without consulting India.

He said, "India must investigate whether the Sri Lankans consulted with India or informed us of their decision before making such a move."

According to reports, the Sri Lankan government reached a ceasefire agreement with the Tiger Liberation Organization during negotiations, without Indian involvement.

    印度说未同印商量斯双方不得达成协议
    新华社科伦坡６月２８日电  斯里兰卡泰米尔伊拉姆猛虎解放组织２７日宣布，它决定停止与政府的敌对活动，一切问题将通过谈判和讨论来解决。
    斯里兰卡政府今天对该组织的决定表示欢迎并宣布，政府也将停止对该组织的一切敌对活动。至此，双方结束了６年的敌对状况，握手言和。
    泰米尔伊拉姆猛虎解放组织是斯里兰卡最强大的泰米尔人武装组织。自１９８３年以来，它一直为斯东部和北部的独立而与中央政府进行对抗。１９８７年，印度军队开进斯里兰卡，解除泰米尔人武装，该组织与印军展开了游击战。今年初，斯里兰卡总统普雷马达萨要求印度撤军，决定自己解决国内问题。４月２６日，这个猛虎解放组织接受总统邀请，双方开始谈判，同时该组织宣布与政府军停火。
    经过谈判，双方同意，所有社团应该团结在总统周围，确保印度撤军；所有社团和组织应该在不受外来干涉的情况下，通过协商解决一切问题。
    新华社新德里６月２８日电　印度外交部发言人今天说，根据印—斯协议，斯里兰卡政府，未经与印度商量，不得与泰米尔伊拉姆猛虎解放组织达成停火协议。
    他说，印度必须调查“斯里兰卡人在决定这样做之前是否与印度商量过及是否向我们通报过他们的决定”这一问题。
    据报道，斯里兰卡政府同猛虎解放组织在谈判中达成了停火协议，印度未参与谈判。
