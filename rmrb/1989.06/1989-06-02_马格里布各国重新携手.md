The leaders of Libya, Tunisia, Algeria, Morocco, and Mauritania signed the treaty establishing the Arab Maghreb Union and documents outlining the phased realization of Maghreb economic integration in Marrakech, Morocco, on February 17 this year. The establishment of this new regional group has both cultural and historical roots and is also a result of changes in the current international political and economic situation.

The Maghreb, meaning "West" in Arabic, generally refers to the Arab regions west of Egypt. Since the 1960s, the Maghreb countries have begun to promote the process of unity by strengthening economic cooperation. From 1964 to 1975, Algeria, Morocco, Tunisia, and Libya held seven meetings of economic ministers, established the "Maghreb Permanent Consultative Committee," and conducted extensive discussions on how to achieve "Maghreb economic integration" and "economic unity." Unfortunately, after the late 1960s, the Maghreb countries had sharp disagreements in their socio-economic development strategies, political system choices, and stances on certain major international issues. In particular, the Western Sahara War that broke out at the end of 1975 turned the Maghreb countries into enemies, and the discussion of economic integration was suspended after 1975.

The significant changes in the international political and economic situation in the 1980s have once again pushed the process of Maghreb unity. The trend of dialogue replacing confrontation in international political relations has weakened the various international factors that caused discord among the Maghreb countries, greatly easing the tense situation in the Maghreb region and creating a good international political environment for the Maghreb countries to join hands and cooperate. At the same time, the common challenges faced by the Maghreb countries today have also made them more urgent to achieve regional unity. On the one hand, the Maghreb countries are generally burdened with heavy foreign debt, deteriorating trade conditions, and serious employment problems, and their economic development is hindered, so they urgently hope to improve their comprehensive economic development capabilities through economic unity and explore new paths for economic development. On the other hand, the internal unified market of the European Economic Community, which will be established in 1992, poses an imminent threat to the export of traditional products of the Maghreb countries. Therefore, the Maghreb countries urgently need to adopt a united approach to strengthen their negotiating power with the EEC.

As a whole, the Maghreb countries have more than 6 million square kilometers of land and more than 60 million people, rich in oil, minerals, agriculture, fisheries, and tourism resources, with an initial industrial base and good transportation conditions. Their geographical location is close to developed Western Europe, which is convenient for economic and technological exchanges, and indeed has the potential economic complementarity required for economic unity. On the other hand, the Maghreb controls Europe's southern gateway and is an important source of energy and raw materials for Europe, as well as an important export market, so it is also of great significance to the EEC. However, it should be noted that the Maghreb countries are still in a disadvantageous position in the current irrational international economic order, and in the markets for the export of commodities and labor, as well as in the supply of funds, technology, and a large number of consumer goods, they are deeply dependent on the EEC countries. Moreover, this dependence often far exceeds the actual economic complementarity between the Maghreb countries. Therefore, whether the Arab Maghreb Union can develop smoothly in the direction of economic integration in the future will, to a large extent, depend on how the Maghreb countries can take practical measures to turn potential economic complementarity into a reality of economic cooperation and gradually reduce their over-reliance on the EEC. In addition, the significant differences in the current political and economic systems and ideologies of the Maghreb countries are undoubtedly an important factor constraining the relations between the Maghreb countries. Therefore, the Arab Maghreb Union still faces a tortuous and arduous test on its way forward.

　　马格里布各国重新携手
    杨光
    今年２月１７日，利比亚、突尼斯、阿尔及利亚、摩洛哥和毛里塔尼亚５国元首在摩洛哥南方城市马拉喀什签署了阿拉伯马格里布联盟成立条约和分阶段实现马格里布经济一体化的文件。这个新的地区性集团的成立既有其文化历史渊源，也是当前国际政治经济局势变化的结果。
    马格里布是阿拉伯语“西方”的意思，泛指埃及以西的阿拉伯地区。从６０年代开始，马格里布各国开始从加强经济合作入手推动统一进程。１９６４—１９７５年，阿、摩、突和利比亚共召开过７届经济部长会议，设立了“马格里布常设协商委员会”，并围绕如何实现“马格里布经济一体化”和“经济统一”的问题进行过多方面的探讨。但遗憾的是，马格里布各国在６０年代末以后在社会经济发展战略和政治制度选择，以及对待某些重大国际问题的立场上都出现了比较尖锐的分歧，特别是１９７５年底爆发的西撒战争使马格里布各国反目为仇，经济一体化的探讨自１９７５年以后暂告中断。
    ８０年代国际政治经济局势的重大转变重新推动了马格里布统一的进程。国际政治关系中对话代替对抗的趋势弱化了造成马格里布各国之间不和的多种国际因素，大大缓和了马格里布地区的紧张局势，为马格里布各国重新携手合作开创了良好的国际政治环境。与此同时，马格里布各国当前共同面临的挑战也使它们增强了实现区域性联合的紧迫感。一方面，马格里布各国普遍面临沉重的外债负担、恶化的贸易条件和严重的就业问题，经济发展受阻，因而迫切希望通过实现经济联合提高经济发展的综合实力，探求经济发展的新途径；另一方面，１９９２年即将建成的欧洲经济共同体内部统一市场，对马格里布国家传统产品的出口构成的威胁已迫在眉睫。因此，马格里布国家迫切需要采取联合方式，增强对欧共体的谈判实力。
    马格里布国家作为一个整体，拥有６００多万平方公里土地和６０００多万人口、丰富的石油、矿产、农业、渔业和旅游业资源，有初具规模的工业基础，以及良好的交通运输条件，地理位置临近发达的西欧，便于开展经济技术交往，确有实现经济联合所必须的潜在经济互补性。另一方面，马格里布扼守欧洲的南大门，并且是欧洲的能源，原料的重要供应来源和重要出口市场，因此对欧共体而言也确有重要意义。但是也应看到，马格里布国家在当前不合理的国际经济秩序中仍处在不利地位，在商品和劳动力输出市场、资金、技术乃至大量的消费品供应上都深深依赖于欧共体国家。而且这种依赖性往往大大超过马格里布各国之间的现实经济互补性。因此，阿拉伯马格里布联盟今后能否朝着经济一体化的方向顺利发展，在很大程度上将取决于马格里布各国如何切实采取措施，把潜在的经济互补性转化为经济合作的现实，并逐步摆脱对欧共体的过度依赖。另外，马格里布各国现行政治经济制度和意识形态的显著差异无疑也是制约马格里布各国关系的一个重要因素。因此，阿拉伯马格里布联盟在前进的道路上仍面临着艰苦曲折的考验。
