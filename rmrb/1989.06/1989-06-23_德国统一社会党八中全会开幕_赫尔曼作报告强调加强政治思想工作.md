The Eighth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany Opens
Hermann Delivers Report Emphasizing Strengthening Political and Ideological Work

BERLIN, June 22 (Xinhua) -- Hermann, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany and a secretary of the Central Committee, delivered a report at the opening of the 8th Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee of the Socialist Unity Party of Germany today. The report focused on the party's work priorities, the current situation in the German Democratic Republic (GDR), and the international situation.

Hermann stressed that in the future, party organizations at all levels should pay more attention to the criticisms and suggestions of the people, patiently and principledly explain the party's policies to the people, strengthen the persuasiveness of political and ideological work, and take effective measures to further strengthen the trust between the party and the people.

Hermann summarized the tremendous achievements made by the GDR in economic development and social progress. He pointed out that in the first five months of this year, the GDR's national income from production grew by 4 percent, and the completion of the plan was good. In the future, the unified economic policy and social welfare policy should continue to be implemented. Through the development of advanced technology, labor productivity should be improved and economic benefits realized. He also announced that the method of self-raising funds by joint enterprises, which has been tested, will be gradually promoted. He said that the results of the trial in 16 joint enterprises over a year and a half showed that this method could promote the joint enterprises to fully tap the potential for production and efficiency growth. Therefore, in formulating the plan for next year, another 40 joint enterprises under the jurisdiction of the industrial departments, such as electronics and machinery manufacturing, will also begin to implement the self-raising funds method, and more experience will be collected for the gradual adoption of this method by joint enterprises in all departments.

Hermann stated that the GDR will continue to stand shoulder to shoulder with brotherly countries, develop friendly cooperation with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries. The GDR insists on maintaining peaceful coexistence with West Germany, adheres to the policy of being good neighbors with West Berlin, but expresses concern about the increasing influence of neo-Nazi forces in the Federal Republic of Germany. He emphasized that the Berlin Wall cannot be demolished because the GDR cannot give up its own security, cannot prevent the infiltration of criminals engaged in economic plundering, psychological warfare, and drug trafficking.

Hermann called on the entire party and the people of the nation to strive to achieve new successes to welcome the 40th anniversary of the founding of the country and the 12th Party Congress.

The plenary session will continue on the 23rd.

　　德国统一社会党八中全会开幕    
    赫尔曼作报告强调加强政治思想工作
    本报柏林６月２２日电  记者许宏治报道：德国统一社会党中央政治局委员、中央书记赫尔曼在今天召开的德党１１届８中全会上就党的工作重点、民主德国当前形势和国际局势作了报告。
    赫尔曼强调，今后，各级党组织要更重视人民群众的批评意见，认真考虑群众的建议，同时要耐心而有原则地向群众解释党的政策，加强政治思想工作的说服力，采取有效措施，进一步加强党与人民之间的信任关系。
    赫尔曼总结了民德在发展经济和社会进步方面取得的巨大成就。他指出，今年头５个月民德生产性国民收入增长４％，完成计划情况良好。今后要继续执行经济政策与社会福利政策相统一的总方针。要通过发展尖端科技来提高劳动生产率，实现经济效益。同时，他还宣布，经过试行的联合企业自筹资金的办法将要逐步推广。他说，在１６个联合企业一年半的试行结果表明，这一办法能够促进联合企业全面发掘内部的生产和效益增长的潜力。因此，在制订明年的计划时，让所有工业部所属的电子、机械制造联合企业等另外４０个联合企业也开始实行自筹资金的办法，为所有部门的联合企业逐步采用这一办法搜集更多的经验。
    赫尔曼表示，民德将继续肩并肩和兄弟国家站在一起，发展同苏联和其他社会主义国家的友好合作关系。民德坚持与西德保持和平共处的关系，奉行同西柏林做好邻居的政策，但对联邦德国的新纳粹势力影响增大表示忧虑。他强调，柏林墙不能拆除，因为民德不能放弃自己的安全，不能不防止经济掠夺、搞心理战的犯罪分子的渗入及毒品交易。
    赫尔曼号召全党和全国人民努力以新的成就来迎接建国４０周年和党的１２大。
    全会２３日继续举行。
