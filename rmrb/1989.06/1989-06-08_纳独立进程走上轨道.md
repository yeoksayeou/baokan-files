After the South African colonial authorities deliberately delayed, South African President Pieter Botha finally signed the amnesty proclamation today, granting amnesty to Namibians in exile abroad. Now, the United Nations Security Council's Resolution 435 on Namibia's independence plan can be implemented, and the once-stalled process of Namibia's independence is back on track.

The promulgation of the amnesty law first creates conditions for the return of Namibian refugees. In Angola, Zambia, and Botswana, 41,000 Namibians have registered to return to Namibia to participate in the November 1 elections. United Nations agencies are expediting preparations to ensure their safe and speedy return. In Angola and other countries, several airplanes and large buses have been chartered, and several entry points have been established on the Namibia border. Many reception centers have been set up within Namibia, stocked with food and medicine.

About 80,000 Namibian refugees who fled to Angola and other neighboring countries to oppose South African colonial rule have registered to return. The registration process will continue.

Other important measures in the independence plan, which were not implemented on schedule earlier, are now finally being carried out. The first condition for starting the independence process—ceasefire—has been achieved in Namibia. South African troops have withdrawn to their bases as required, and most have already left. Only 4,000 troops remain in Namibia. The South African colonial authorities' established Namibian Territorial Force has been "demobilized." Many discriminatory and restrictive laws, regulations, and administrative measures in Namibia that hinder free and fair elections have been announced as revoked by the South African authorities today.

Several important measures that were supposed to be completed by mid-May under the independence plan have not yet been fully implemented. For example, all legislation not in accordance with the United Nations plan, including proclamations by the South African administrator in Namibia, has not been revoked, the general election rules have not been published, and Namibian political prisoners and detainees held by the South African authorities have not been released.

The free and fair elections scheduled for November 1 are the core of the Namibia independence plan, and the political process before that is crucial to whether the elections can be free and fair. The struggle among the relevant parties is intense.

The South African authorities are using various means to undermine the power of the South West Africa People's Organization (SWAPO), attempting to prevent them from winning the elections or at least from obtaining two-thirds of the seats in the "constitutional assembly." The delay in implementing several important measures in the independence plan is due to South Africa's obstruction. It seeks to compress the political process before the elections, giving SWAPO insufficient time to prepare for the campaign. During negotiations with the United Nations on the promulgation of the amnesty law, the South African authorities insisted on the condition that South African troops have the right to suppress SWAPO at any time, which was firmly opposed and did not succeed. The South African authorities still claim that the South African troops remaining in the base are "prepared for any eventuality," attempting to threaten SWAPO.

The South African colonial authorities are also directly playing tricks in the election issue. In the election law, they raised the minimum voting age from 18 to 21, causing SWAPO to lose a large number of young voters. They tried to move blacks in Angola, Botswana, and South Africa who are opposed to SWAPO to Namibia and grant them Namibian citizenship, creating a situation unfavorable to SWAPO in the number of voters. They also create public opinion to defame SWAPO; take measures to restrict SWAPO's activities; deploy police to intimidate residents, warning them not to vote for SWAPO, and so on.

The South African authorities are also providing election funds for pro-South African political forces to maintain control over Namibia.

SWAPO is urgently devising countermeasures. It has established a unified election command center, strengthened the unity of its domestic and overseas leadership organizations, formulated new programs and policies, and is mobilizing and organizing voters within the country to strive for victory in the elections and achieve true independence for Namibia.

The situation in Namibia is severe. Although the independence process is back on track, the road ahead will be bumpy.

### 纳独立进程走上轨道

　　纳独立进程走上轨道
    本报记者  刘开宸
    在南非殖民当局有意拖延之后，南非总统彼得·博塔终于在今天签署了大赦公告，对流亡在国外的纳米比亚人实行大赦。现在，关于纳米比亚独立计划的联合国安理会４３５号决议可以执行，一度受阻的纳米比亚独立进程回到轨道上。
    大赦法的颁布，首先为纳米比亚难民的返回工作创造了条件。在安哥拉、赞比亚和博茨瓦纳等国已有４．１万纳米比亚人登记，要求回到纳米比亚参加１１月１日的大选。联合国有关机构正在加紧准备工作，使他们尽快地顺利返回。在安哥拉等国包租了一些飞机和大轿车等交通工具，在纳米比亚边境上建立了若干入境点，还在纳米比亚境内设立了许多接待处，备有食品、药品等。
    为反对南非殖民统治而逃到安哥拉等邻国的纳米比亚难民共约８万人。难民要求返回的登记工作，将继续进行。
    独立计划的其它几项重要措施，前些时候未能按期执行，现在也终于实施。开始独立进程的首要条件──停火，已在纳米比亚实现。南非军队已按规定退回到基地内，而且大部分已撤离，现在只有４０００军队留在纳米比亚。南非殖民当局在当地建立的纳米比亚国土军已经“复员”。在纳米比亚有许多歧视性和限制性法律、规章和行政措施，是阻碍自由和公正选举的，今天也由南非当局宣布撤销。
    按独立计划应于５月中完成的几项重要措施，尚未完全执行。如所有不符合联合国计划的立法──包括南非在纳米比亚的行政长官的公告尚未撤销，选举的总则尚未公布，南非当局关押的纳米比亚政治犯和政治拘留者尚未释放。
    定于１１月１日进行自由公正的选举，是纳米比亚独立计划的核心，而在此之前的政治过程，则是选举能否自由公正的关键。有关各方间的斗争相当激烈。
    南非当局正采取各种手段，打击西南非洲人民组织（人组）的力量，企图阻挠他们在大选中获胜，至少不让他们获得“制宪议会”２／３多数席位。独立计划几项重要措施的拖延执行，就是由于南非的阻挠。它企图借此压缩大选前的政治进程，使人组没有充分的时间进行竞选准备工作。南非当局在与联合国方面商谈颁布大赦法问题时，曾坚持以南非军队有权随时镇压人组为条件，遭到坚决反对，未能得逞。现在南非当局仍然声称，留在基地内的南非军队仍要“准备万一”，企图威胁人组。
    南非殖民当局还在选举问题上直接耍花招，它在选举法中，将选民的最低年龄从１８岁提高到２１岁，使人组失去大批年轻人的选票。它设法把居住在安哥拉、博茨瓦纳和南非的反对人组的黑人移居到纳米比亚并加入纳米比亚籍，使选民人数上造成对人组不利的局面。它还制造舆论，诋毁人组；采取措施，限制人组活动；出动警察恫吓居民，警告他们不得投人组的票，等等。
    南非当局还为亲南非的政治势力提供竞选经费，以图保持对纳米比亚的控制。
    人组急谋对策。它成立了大选统一指挥部，加强国内外领导机构的团结。制订了新的纲领和政策。正在国内动员和组织选民，力图在选举中获胜，以谋求纳米比亚获得真正独立。
    纳米比亚的形势是严峻的，独立进程虽已走上轨道，但前进的过程中，将是颠簸不平的。
