	In the Eighth Session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress

	Dear Commissioners:

	The Eighth Session of the Standing Committee of the Seventh National People's Congress begins today.

	Everyone knows that since the adjournment of the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, we have undergone a severe political struggle that concerns the life and death of the Party and the state. Since mid-April, a small number of people with ulterior motives have used student movements to instigate a planned, organized, and premeditated political turmoil in Beijing and some other places, which then escalated into a counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing. Their goal in instigating the turmoil and riot was to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subvert the socialist People's Republic of China. As Comrade Deng Xiaoping pointed out: "This turmoil was bound to happen. It was determined by both the international climate and China's own climate, and it was inevitable, regardless of people's will." In this serious political struggle, the Party Central Committee made major decisions, and the State Council, in accordance with Article 89, Item 16 of the Constitution, decided to impose martial law in certain areas of Beijing. The Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission took decisive measures in response to the situation's development and resolutely suppressed this counter-revolutionary riot. This major decision represents the fundamental interests of the people of all nationalities across the country and is legal, correct, and necessary. The older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at the core, had a far-reaching vision and played a significant role in this struggle. The People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the public security police made tremendous contributions. We express our highest respect to the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the public security police for their outstanding achievements in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot! We extend our heartfelt greetings to the comrades who were injured in the struggle! We express our deep sorrow for the martyrs who sacrificed their lives!

	We have achieved a decisive victory in crushing the counter-revolutionary riot. The social order in the capital has quickly been restored, and the situation is stabilizing. The situation across the country is stable. After suppressing the riot, the tasks before us are arduous. Currently, the entire Party, the military, and the people across the country are seriously studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech, unifying their understanding, and consciously aligning their political actions with those of the Party Central Committee. The Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee, held a few days ago, is a very important meeting in the history of our Party. It not only has a significant impact on further stabilizing the national situation at present but will also have a profound influence on ensuring the continuity of the Party's line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. We must continue to resolutely implement the line, principles, and policies formulated since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee and resolutely implement the basic line of "one center, two basic points" determined by the Thirteenth National Congress. Economic construction is the center, and we must resolutely achieve the strategic goals of economic development. The Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the state and must be upheld without wavering and consistently. Reform and opening up are the path to national strength and must be pursued steadfastly and consistently, never reverting to the old path of closing the country off from the world. At present, we must pay special attention to the four major tasks proposed by the Plenum. At this session of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, we must seriously study the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session and deeply understand the spirit of the meeting. Upholding the system of people's congresses is an important part of the political system reform in our country. Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, we must continue to develop socialist democracy and improve socialist legal systems, making this fundamental political system stronger and more perfect. We must fully recognize that the highest interest of China is stability. We must strengthen education on socialist democracy and legal systems among the people of all nationalities across the country, enhance socialist democratic consciousness and legal awareness. Everyone must consciously exercise the democratic rights granted by the Constitution, while strictly fulfilling the duties prescribed by the Constitution and laws. Citizens must not infringe upon the interests of the state, society, collectives, or the lawful freedoms and rights of other citizens when exercising their freedoms and rights, and must use the law to constrain their own behavior. In this way, our country can be both full of vitality and stable and united, achieving long-term governance and smoothly implementing the series of lines, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee.

	Now, I will make some explanations regarding the agenda and the meeting time of this Standing Committee session: (1) This session was originally scheduled to be held around June 20th. However, in early June, students were still sitting and petitioning in Tiananmen Square, and some even threatened to withdraw only after the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress convened around June 20th, exerting pressure. After discussion, the spokesperson of the General Office issued a statement to Xinhua News Agency reporters, stating that due to the students' sit-in and demonstrations in the square, it would be difficult to hold the Standing Committee session as scheduled in such an environment. Later, the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission took decisive measures to suppress the counter-revolutionary riot that occurred in Beijing, and the Central Committee also convened the Fourth Plenary Session, providing us with a clear guiding ideology and necessary conditions to hold this Standing Committee session well. Therefore, the Chairman's meeting on June 26th decided that the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress would be held today. (2) The agenda of this session has some changes compared to the agenda proposed in mid-May. The Chairman's meeting on June 26th considered that the Fourth Plenary Session is a very important meeting and suggested including the study and discussion of the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session in the agenda of this session. The reports on the rectification and reorganization of companies and the drafting of the Press Law were previously suggested to be included in the agenda. However, due to the recent focus of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and relevant departments on studying and handling the issues of stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot, further measures are needed to punish corruption and rectify companies to achieve results; the drafting of the Press Law also needs to summarize the experience and lessons learned from the guidance of public opinion in the work of stopping the turmoil and suppressing the riot, and enrich the content in this regard. To better handle the rectification and reorganization of companies and the drafting of the Press Law, the original two agenda items are not included in this session. Regarding the decision on the timing of county and township elections, due to some issues that need to be further studied based on the current situation, it is also not included in the agenda.

	It is very important to hold this Standing Committee session well. We should take Comrade Xiaoping's speech and the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session as the guiding ideology for this session. I hope everyone will follow this guiding ideology, fully practice democracy, unite as one, and strive to make this session a success.

　　在人大常委会第八次会议上的讲话
    万里
    各位委员：
    全国人大常委会第八次会议今天开始举行。
    大家知道，七届全国人大二次会议闭会以来的这段时间，我们经历了一场关系到党和国家生死存亡的严重的政治斗争。从４月中旬以来，极少数别有用心的人利用学潮，在北京和一些地方掀起一场有计划、有组织、有预谋的政治动乱，进而在北京发展成了反革命暴乱。他们策动动乱和暴乱的目的，就是要推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义的中华人民共和国。正如邓小平同志指出的：“这场风波迟早要来。这是国际的大气候和中国自己的小气候所决定了的，是一定要来的，是不以人们的意志为转移的。”在这场严肃的政治斗争中，党中央作出了重大决策，国务院根据宪法第八十九条第十六项的规定，决定在北京市部分地区实行戒严。党中央、国务院、中央军委根据事态发展，采取了果断措施，坚决平息了这场反革命暴乱。这一重大决策代表了全国各族人民的根本利益，是合法的、正确的、必要的。以邓小平同志为代表的老一辈无产阶级革命家高瞻远瞩，在这场斗争中发挥了重大作用。中国人民解放军、武警部队和公安干警作出了巨大贡献。我们向在平息反革命暴乱中立下丰功伟绩的中国人民解放军、武警部队和公安干警表示崇高的敬意！向光荣负伤的同志表示亲切的慰问！向英勇献身的烈士表示沉痛的哀悼！
    我们已经取得了粉碎反革命暴乱的决定性胜利。首都的社会秩序迅速恢复，形势已趋于稳定。全国的形势是稳定的。平息暴乱以后，摆在我们面前的任务十分艰巨。现在全党、全军和全国人民都在认真学习邓小平同志的重要讲话，统一认识，自觉地在政治上、行动上与党中央保持一致。前几天召开的党的十三届四中全会，在我们党的历史上是一次非常重要的会议。它不仅对于当前进一步稳定全国局势具有重大作用，而且对于保证十一届三中全会以来的党的路线、方针、政策的连续性，必将产生深远的影响。我们要继续坚决执行党的十一届三中全会以来制定的路线、方针和政策，继续坚决执行十三大确定的“一个中心，两个基本点”的基本路线。经济建设是中心，必须坚决实现经济发展的战略目标。四项基本原则是立国之本，必须毫不动摇、始终一贯地加以坚持；改革开放是强国之路，必须坚定不移、一如既往地贯彻执行，绝不回到闭关锁国的老路上去。当前要特别注意抓好全会提出的四件大事。在这次人大常委会议上，我们要认真学习四中全会有关文件，深刻领会会议精神。坚持实行人民代表大会制度，是我国政治体制改革的一项重要内容。我们要在党中央领导下，继续发展社会主义民主，健全社会主义法制，使人民代表大会这个根本政治制度不断加强和完善。我们要充分认识到，中国最高利益就是稳定。要在全国各族人民中加强社会主义民主和法制教育，增强社会主义民主意识和法制观念。大家既自觉地行使宪法赋予自己的民主权利，又严格履行宪法和法律规定的义务。公民在行使自由和权利的时候，不得损害国家的、社会的、集体的利益和其他公民的合法的自由和权利，用法律约束自己的行为。这样就可以使我们国家既充满活力，又安定团结，达到长治久安，顺利贯彻执行十一届三中全会以来的一系列路线、方针、政策。
    现在我对这次常委会议的议程和开会时间，作点说明：（１）这次会议原定于６月２０日左右举行。但由于６月初学生仍在天安门广场静坐请愿，有人甚至扬言要到６月２０日左右人大常委会开会后再撤离，施加压力。经研究，办公厅新闻发言人向新华社记者发表谈话，说明由于学生在广场静坐、示威，在这种环境下如期举行常委会议确有困难。以后党中央、国务院、中央军委采取果断措施，平息了在北京发生的反革命暴乱，中央并召开了四中全会，使我们有了开好这次常委会议的明确指导思想和必要条件。所以６月２６日委员长会议决定，人大常委会议在今天举行。（２）这次会议的议程比５月中旬建议的议程有些变化。６月２６日委员长会议考虑到四中全会是一次非常重要的会议，建议把学习讨论四中全会精神列入本次会议议程。清理整顿公司和新闻法起草工作两个汇报曾建议列入议程，由于最近一个时期，党中央、国务院和有关部门集中精力研究处理制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱问题，惩治腐败、整顿公司还需进一步采取措施，作出成效；新闻法的起草工作也要总结这次制止动乱和平息暴乱工作中的舆论导向的经验教训，充实这方面的内容。为了把清理整顿公司和新闻法起草的工作搞得更好，原定的这两项议程这次会议暂不列入。关于县乡选举时间的决定，因有些问题需要根据当前情况作进一步研究，这次也不列入议程。
    开好这次常委会议很重要。我们要把小平同志讲话和四中全会的精神作为这次会议的指导思想。希望大家按照这一指导思想，充分发扬民主，同心同德，努力把这次会议开好。
