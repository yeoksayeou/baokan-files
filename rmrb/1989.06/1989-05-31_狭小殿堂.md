One day, a group of timid children suddenly appeared in front of a large iron gate at the eastern corner of Dafosi Temple. Parents with a few silver strands in their hair stood incongruously among them. On that early May morning in the north, the chill had not yet dissipated. Children dressed in various cotton clothes instinctively hunched their shoulders, their clear and bewildered eyes sometimes reflecting longing, sometimes showing unease.

They were waiting for the entrance exam.

Dongniao still remembers that when he was three years old, he drew a black sparrow with a few strokes, and his father was overjoyed. He wrote a line on the drawing: "A thousand-mile journey begins with a single step." Twelve years have passed, and his drawings have piled up like a mountain. The night before the exam, the drawings were spread all over the house, and father and son huddled among them, looking through them. He remembered the scorching sun on the streets, the snowflakes on the tombs, the waves on the ship, and the mountains in the drizzle. But the tears and slaps had vanished like the shadow of the sun. His father said that drawing, like a person, has its peaks and troughs. Dongniao's talent peaked at eight years old. He hoped that today would bring another peak, and he prayed for himself as he stepped over the threshold.

Xiaohé was still hesitating until yesterday: with only one class nationwide and one out of ten being accepted, it would be better to study computers. He had always been brilliant in math, physics, and chemistry, and his scores were always at the top. Three years ago, he accidentally got into a middle school with an attached art class, which pushed him onto the path of learning art. During the dull and rigorous basic skills training, he imagined using a computer to draw in the future. Perhaps a person's interest choice is a torment in itself. Now, dressed in his uniform, Xiaohé looked at the crowd of his peers on the playground and whispered to his mother, "Look at them all so passionate, I don't seem to belong in this circle." In the heavy and tense atmosphere, the chattering Xianxian appeared more open and free-spirited. In fact, she had her share of worries. She had the good fortune of following her father, who organized art exhibitions, on a trip abroad, and casually brought back a high school diploma, but it also brought her excessive pain from cramming. She had to memorize ancient texts, politics, and grammar, making her face even paler. The stark contrast of different national conditions also made it hard for her to adapt. "Dad, I'm afraid I won't pass the exam!" She issued warnings at home over and over again, "It's all because you insisted on coming back!" How could she understand that her father's works were born from this land, and he feared losing his roots. Now, after spending five months and 1,500 yuan on tutoring fees for his daughter, he was a bit uncertain about his decision.

The assembly whistle blew. The children hurriedly lined up in the exam queue, disappearing one by one into the grayish building.

The playground was empty. The fathers and mothers sitting outside had their hearts emptied as well. At this moment, there was only one thing left to do: stare at the transparent, faint sunlight as it slowly moved across the sky, spreading over this narrow yet magical campus.

"The school buildings aren't great, but it's still hard to get in!" someone muttered.

"Apparently, there are quite a few students from this school!" another person revealed.

"It's not like becoming an official, so what's the big deal? That's called genetic inheritance."

Perhaps 30 years ago, they were small, and in Xiaohé's mother's memory, the school was very large, spacious, and beautiful.

"Remember?" she lightly massaged her tired eyelids while chatting with an old classmate. "For the National Day, we participated in the cultural parade. The girls wore pink dresses, and the boys wore white, all gathered on this playground."

"I remember the soup bowl with only a few vegetable leaves floating in it, eating black steamed buns, and not being able to go to the toilet." Xianxian's father rubbed his balding head and said sarcastically.

"And I donated two jin of grain coupons every month!"

"Right, your face was swollen like steamed buns, and your hands were frozen and bleeding when you went out to sketch. You were such a fool!" "But David still drew brilliantly, and your composition 'The wind from Inner Mongolia' had a great rhythm!" Dongniao's father squinted his eyes, as if he were really in a chaotic dusk.

"Unfortunately, the artificial hill is gone, the swings are gone, a piece of land has been taken over, a hole has been dug, and a lathe has been installed. The old building is dilapidated and there's no money to fix it. No wonder when it comes to our children, everything is lacking!"

"But not people!"

"But teachers..."

The conversation suddenly fell silent because the bell rang, and the children should have finished their exam. At this moment, whether it was the fathers or the mothers, their eyes were all focused on that dirty door. Would it open to bring good news or misfortune? It was about to hit their hearts.

Xianxian's smooth forehead appeared. She waved her hand in an American style: "No! No! Why insist on one path?"

Soon after, the young and mature Xiaohé pushed his glasses up and stepped down. He wrinkled his brow at his mother: "I got a bad angle on a flying bird!"

Finally, it was Dongniao. He saw his father and his face flushed: "Peak! Dad, another peak!"

An old teacher with gray hair smiled and walked over to them:

"When you came to take the exam, you all came by yourselves. Now that you're fathers and mothers, you have to accompany your children?"

"Teacher, back then it was easy to get in, but now it's too narrow, and the children are struggling..." Dongniao's father said.

　　狭小殿堂
    赵蘅
    有一天，大福寺东拐口的一扇大铁门前突然出现了一群怯生生的孩子。鬓发略露银丝的家长不协调地夹在他们中间。５月初的北方早晨凉意未褪，身着各色棉织衣裤的孩子们不由得缩起双肩，一只只清澈而迷茫的瞳仁里时而透出一种神往时而又显示出不安。
    他们正在等待招生考试。
    东鸟始终记得他三岁那年信笔涂抹了一只黑色小八哥，爸爸欣喜若狂，在画上题了一行大字：“千里之行始于足下”。十二年过去了，他的画变成小山一样多。报考前夕，画摊了一屋，父子二人趴在画堆里翻看。他又记起烈日炎炎的街头，雪花飘飘的陵墓，江轮上的波峰，细雨中的山峦。而那些个眼泪、巴掌像太阳的影子一样消失了。爸爸说画画像人一样有生长高峰，也有低潮，东鸟的才华高峰是在八岁。但愿今天又临一次高峰，他在踏进门坎的瞬间保佑自己。
    晓河直到昨天还在犯嘀咕：全国只招一个班，十个人取一人，还不如去学电脑。他从小就在数理化上灵光，考分总名列前茅，三年前歪打正着进了一所附设美术班的中学，从此把他推上了学艺的道儿。在枯燥而严格的基本功训练间隙，他遐想着将来用电脑画画。也许人的兴趣选择本来就是一桩苦恼，这会儿，一身制服的晓河瞅着挤满操场的同代人，小声对妈妈说：“瞧他们一个个那么入潮，我简直不像这个圈子里的。”在一片沉闷紧张的气氛中，喋喋不休的恬恬倒显得大方洒脱。其实她的愁并不少。得天独厚地跟办画展的爸爸逛了一趟异国，轻松地带回一张中学毕业证书，也同时给她带来了超量的补课的苦痛。背古文背政治背语法，累得她脸更苍白了，加上不同国情的强烈反差更使她难以适应。“爸爸，我怕要考不上了！”在家中她一次次发出警报，“就是你偏要回来！”她哪里能懂爸爸的作品产生于这块土地，他怕失掉根。现在当他为女儿付出了五个月一千五百元的补习费后，却对自己的决断有点茫然了。
    集合哨声响了。孩子们急匆匆排入考生队伍，依次消失在灰不拉几的楼门里。
    操场腾空了。退至场外地而坐的父亲母亲们的心也被腾得空空荡荡。此时只剩下一件事可做：干瞪着透明淡泊的阳光一点一点挪向天空，漫射在这个狭小的而神奇的校园里。
    “校舍不怎么样，还挺难进！”有人在叨咕。
    “听说有不少本校子弟呢！”又一位透露。
    “又不是做官，那怕什么，这叫遗传基因嘛。”
    也许３０年前他们个儿小，在晓河妈的记忆中，母校本是很大很宽很美的呀。
    “还记得吗？国庆参加文艺仪仗队，女生一身桃红衣裙男生一身白，就在这操场上集合。”她一边轻轻按摩疲乏的眼皮一边与老同学搭话。
    “我更记得汤盆里只飘着几根菜叶子，吃黑窝头拉不出屎来。”恬恬爸爸摸摸早谢的头顶，不无讥讽地说。
    “那我还每月捐献二斤粮票呢！”
    “是喽，脸蛋肿得像蒸馍，外出画速写手冻裂了直淌血，傻帽！”
    “可大卫照旧画得棒棒的，你那张记忆构图‘内蒙古刮来的风’调子绝了！”东鸟爸眯缝着双眼，仿佛真的置身在一片浑沌的黄昏中。
    “可惜假山没了，秋千没了，地皮给人占去一块儿，凿了眼儿，装了车床。大楼破旧了也没钱整治，难怪轮到咱们孩子的头上什么都缺！”
    “就不缺人！”
    “可缺老师啊……”
    聊到这儿，大伙儿突然沉默了。因为铃声响了，孩子们该考完了。这时无论爸爸还是妈妈的眼珠全都凝聚在那扇脏兮兮的楼门。门将启开，福音？还是厄运？在撞击他们的心。
    恬恬光洁的额头出现了。她美国味地一挥手：“Ｎｏ！Ｎｏ！为什么要强求一种路子？”
    紧跟着，少年老成的晓河推推眼镜框迈下了台阶。他向妈妈一皱眉：“赶上个飞机头大正面！”
    最后才是东鸟。他一眼看见爸爸，小脸泛出红晕：“高峰！爸爸，又一个高峰！”
    一位花白头发的老教师笑吟吟地走到他们跟前：
    “当年你们来考都是自己来的，怎么当了爸爸妈妈反而要陪着孩子？”
    “老师，当年顺顺当当进来，如今太窄了，孩子难呐……”东鸟爸说。
