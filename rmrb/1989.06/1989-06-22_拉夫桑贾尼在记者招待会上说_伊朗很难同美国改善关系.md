    Rafsanjani Says Iran Faces Difficulties in Improving Relations with the U.S.

    MOSCOW, June 22 (Xinhua) — Iranian Parliament Speaker Ali Akbar Hashemi Rafsanjani said that Iran faces difficulties in improving relations with the United States because the U.S. has undermined its own position in Iran.

    Rafsanjani, who is visiting the Soviet Union, said at a press conference today that before the Iranian Revolution, the U.S. implemented a policy of domination in Iran, humiliating the Iranian people. After the revolution, the U.S. adopted a policy of interference and conspiracy, freezing Iranian assets in U.S. banks. He declared that Iran is willing to maintain good relations with all countries, except for a couple of countries, including Israel.

    In response to a question about whether Iran would negotiate with the Soviet Union to purchase weapons during his visit, Rafsanjani said that Iran's defense policy is to defend its country independently, adhering to the principle of independence. Iran can manufacture aircraft, missiles, electronic equipment, armored vehicles, and cannons. When needed, Iran can obtain weapons from various sources.

    The Iranian speaker said that after the Soviet military entered Afghanistan, Iran did not want Soviet troops to be stationed in that country, and the Afghan people did not want the presence of Soviet troops. Now that the issue has been resolved, in the future, it should be up to the Afghan people to solve their own problems, and we have no right to interfere in the internal affairs of the Afghan people.

    He also said that he and Gorbachev clearly agreed in their talks that the Soviet Union and Iran would not interfere in each other's internal affairs.

    拉夫桑贾尼在记者招待会上说
    伊朗很难同美国改善关系
    新华社莫斯科6月22日电（记者唐修哲）伊朗议会议长拉夫桑贾尼说，伊朗很难同美国改善关系，因为美国自己破坏了在伊朗的地位。
    正在苏联访问的拉夫桑贾尼今天在记者招待会上说，伊朗革命前，美国在伊朗执行统治政策，侮辱了伊朗人民。伊朗革命后，美国奉行了干涉和搞阴谋的政策，冻结伊朗在美国银行的存款。他宣称，伊朗愿意同所有国家保持良好关系，只有包括以色列在内的二三个国家不在此列。
    在回答访问期间是否同苏联谈判出售武器的问题时，拉夫桑贾尼说，伊朗的防务政策是自力更生地捍卫自己的国家，坚持独立原则，伊朗自己能制造飞机、导弹、电子设备、装甲车和大炮。在需要时，伊朗可从多种来源获得武器。
    伊朗议长说，苏联军队进入阿富汗后，伊朗不愿苏军驻在那个国家，阿富汗人民也不愿苏军的存在。现在这个问题已经解决，今后要由阿富汗人民自己来解决问题，我们无权干涉阿富汗人民的内政。
    他还说，他和戈尔巴乔夫在会谈中明确商定，苏联和伊朗都不相互干涉对方的内政。
