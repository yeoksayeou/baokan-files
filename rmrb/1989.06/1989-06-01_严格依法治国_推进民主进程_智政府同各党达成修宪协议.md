	Strictly Govern by Law, Advance the Democratic Process
	Chilean Government Reaches Constitutional Amendment Agreement with Various Parties

	On May 31, Chilean President General Pinochet delivered a televised speech announcing that his government had reached an agreement with various political parties on amending the 1980 Constitution.

	He did not disclose the full content of the constitutional amendment bill, but pointed out that the amended constitution would guarantee genuine and responsible political pluralism in the best possible form. He also said that according to the constitutional amendment bill, the number of senators elected directly by citizens would increase; the term of the president who will take office on March 11, 1990, will be four years, and re-election will not be allowed after the term expires.

	The spokesperson for the opposition alliance, composed of 17 parties, Elvin, announced that the opposition alliance representative meeting had adopted the constitutional amendment bill proposed by the government side. Elvin said that some of the opposition's constitutional amendment proposals were accepted by the government, while others were rejected. He also said that when the government distributes the content of the bill, the opposition alliance will issue a written statement specifically explaining its position.

	The military junta, which exercises constitutional and legislative powers, announced that it would urgently study the constitutional amendment bill.

	After Chilean citizens voted to reject Pinochet's re-election in October last year, the opposition emphasized the need to amend as many clauses as possible in the 1980 constitution, which was drafted by the military government and unfavorable to the democratic process, before the election begins. The government had conducted a series of consultations with the opposition on the issue of constitutional amendment, but due to significant differences, the negotiations were suspended in early May.

　　严格依法治国　推进民主进程
    智政府同各党达成修宪协议
    新华社圣地亚哥５月３１日电  智利总统皮诺切特将军５月３１日发表电视讲话，宣布他的政府已同各政党就修改１９８０年宪法问题达成协议。
    他没有披露修改宪法法案的全部内容，但指出修改后的宪法将用最好的形式保证真正的和负责的政治多元化。他还说，根据修宪法案，由公民直接选举的参议员人数将增加；将于１９９０年３月１１日就职的总统任期为４年，任满后不得连任。
    由１７个党组成的反对党联盟发言人埃尔文宣布，反对党联盟代表会议通过了政府方面提出的修宪法案。埃尔文说，反对党提出的修宪建议，有些被政府吸收，有些遭拒绝。他还说，在政府分布法案内容时，反对党联盟将发表一份书面声明，具体阐述自己的立场。
    行使立宪和立法权的军人执政委员会宣布，它将紧急研究修宪法案。
    去年１０月智利公民投票否决了皮诺切特连任总统之后，反对党强调要在竞选开始之前尽量修改军人政府１９８０年制定的宪法中的不利于民主进程的条款。政府曾同反对党就修宪问题进行一系列磋商，但因分歧太大，谈判于５月初中断。
