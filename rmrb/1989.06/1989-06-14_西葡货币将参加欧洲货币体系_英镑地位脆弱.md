European Community officials revealed today that the Spanish currency, the peseta, and the Portuguese currency, the escudo, will become part of the European Currency Unit starting this September. The relevant arrangements have been confirmed by the Community's responsible agencies.

The European Currency Unit is the core component of the European Monetary System, which was established in 1979 and currently comprises 10 currencies. Spain and Portugal, which joined the European Community in 1986, have not yet participated in the European Monetary System.

Given that the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo are relatively weak, it is anticipated that after these two currencies become part of the European Currency Unit, the unit's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar and other strong currencies will tend to decline. However, officials from the Community stated that this decline will be minimal.

On the other hand, the inclusion of the Spanish and Portuguese currencies in the European Currency Unit will alter the current relative weights of the currencies that make up this unit, thereby causing changes in the relationships between some of these currencies.

Meanwhile, on June 13, the pound sterling's exchange rate against the U.S. dollar in the London foreign exchange market fell to 1:1.5165, the lowest level since February 1987.

On the same day, the pound sterling's exchange rate against the West German mark dropped to 1:3.0739, the lowest level since February of the previous year.

### 西葡货币将参加欧洲货币体系  英镑地位脆弱

　　西葡货币将参加欧洲货币体系
    英镑地位脆弱
    据新华社布鲁塞尔６月１３日电  欧洲共同体人士今天透露，西班牙货币比塞塔和葡萄牙货币埃斯库多将于今年９月成为欧洲货币单位的组成部分，有关事宜已由共同体负责机构确定。
    欧洲货币单位是１９７９年成立的欧洲货币体系的中心内容，现由１０种货币组成。１９８６年加入欧洲共同体的西班牙和葡萄牙尚未参加欧洲货币体系。
    由于西班牙比塞塔和葡萄牙埃斯库多比较疲软，预计在这两种货币成为欧洲货币单位后，这一单位对美元和其他坚挺货币的汇价将趋于下降。但共同体方面说，这种下降将是极小的。
    另一方面，西、葡两国货币进入欧洲货币单位将改变目前组成这一单位的各货币的相对比重，从而会引起其中一种货币对其他货币关系的变化。
    据新华社伦敦６月１３日电　１３日伦敦外汇市场上英镑对美元的比价跌到１∶１．５１６５，为１９８７年２月以来的最低水平。
    同日，英镑对西德马克的比价跌到１∶３．０７３９，为去年２月以来的最低水平。
