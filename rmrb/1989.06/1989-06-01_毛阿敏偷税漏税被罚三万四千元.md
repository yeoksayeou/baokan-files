Singer Mao Aimin was fined 34,000 yuan for tax evasion. It is reported that Mao Aimin declared her total income from external performances, amounting to over 270,000 yuan, in four installments within the deadline set by the tax authorities. This declaration was basically consistent with the information obtained by the tax bureau during their investigation. Mao Aimin was required to pay an additional tax of over 150,000 yuan, which she has already paid within the deadline. According to the provisions of the "Provisional Regulations on Tax Collection and Administration of the People's Republic of China" and the principle of "self-examination leniency, strict investigation, seeking truth from facts, and appropriate leniency and severity" during tax inspections, Mao Aimin was fined 30,000 yuan for tax evasion and an additional 4,000 yuan for violating tax declaration regulations. Mao Aimin paid the fine on May 29.
