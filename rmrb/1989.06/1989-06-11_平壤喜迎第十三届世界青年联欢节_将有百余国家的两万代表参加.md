Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 11th.

The 13th World Youth Festival will be held in Pyongyang, the capital of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, from July 1 to 8. This is a grand gathering of youth from around the world.

The World Youth Festival is initiated by the World Federation of Democratic Youth. The first festival was held in Prague in 1947. Since then, it has been held in Budapest, Berlin, Bucharest, Warsaw, Moscow, Vienna, Helsinki, Sofia, and Havana. This 13th festival, to be held in Pyongyang, will have approximately 20,000 representatives and tourists from over 100 countries. The Communist Youth League of China, at the invitation of the Socialist Youth League of Korea, the host country of this festival, will send 300 representatives to participate in some of the festival's activities and has provided material support for the preparations.

The main activities of this festival can be divided into political activities, sports competitions, and artistic performances. During the political activities, representatives from various countries will hold lectures on eight international issues, including anti-war, disarmament, non-alignment, foreign debt, and environmental protection. Various sports competitions and diverse national art performances will be the most eye-catching activities of the festival.

Since February 1987, when it was decided to hold this festival in Pyongyang, the Workers' Party of Korea and the Korean government have mobilized the entire nation and youth to intensively prepare for the festival. To provide suitable venues for this festival, many well-equipped sports facilities, cultural facilities, and service facilities have been built in Pyongyang. These include three stadiums, nine gymnasiums, three hotels, as well as theaters, cinemas, circuses, and a 6-kilometer-long Liberation Boulevard. Hosting this festival has become a matter of common concern for the entire nation. Party and youth league organizations have conducted extensive propaganda and lectures among the residents, mobilizing workers and farmers to strive for better production. Various levels of youth organizations are conducting activities to cultivate and recognize advanced individuals. Outstanding young people from various industries who have achieved excellent results in arts, sports, production, and study will be selected to participate in the festival activities in Pyongyang. A nationwide campaign to clean up streets and houses and beautify the social environment has been carried out in both urban and rural areas. The young students of Pyongyang are now training in formations every day. On the day of the festival's opening, a grand parade and large-scale group gymnastics will be held along the banks of the Taedong River in Pyongyang and inside the "May Day Stadium" (formerly known as the "Ryongmun Stadium," renamed on May 1st), which can accommodate 150,000 spectators.

Now, there are 20 days left until the opening of the festival, but the atmosphere of the festival has already begun to appear in Pyongyang. The civilized and hospitable people of Pyongyang are eagerly awaiting the arrival of young friends from all over the world.

　　平壤喜迎第十三届世界青年联欢节
    将有百余国家的两万代表参加
    新华社平壤６月１１日电  （记者朱克川）第１３届世界青年联欢节７月１日至８日将在朝鲜民主主义人民共和国首都平壤举行。这是一次隆重的世界性青年集会。
    世界青年联欢节的倡导者是世界民主青年联盟。第一届联欢节是１９４７年在布拉格举行的。此后曾在布达佩斯、柏林、布加勒斯特、华沙、莫斯科、维也纳、赫尔辛基、索非亚和哈瓦那等城市举行。这次在平壤举行的第１３届联欢节，将有来自世界１００多个国家的约２万名代表和观光者参加。中国共产主义青年团应本届联欢节东道国朝鲜的社会主义劳动青年同盟的邀请，将派３００名代表参加联欢节的部分活动，并为这次联欢节的筹备工作提供了物质上的支援。
    本届联欢节的主要活动可分为政治活动、体育比赛和文艺演出等。在政治活动中，各国的代表将就反战、裁军、不结盟、外债、保护自然环境等８个方面的国际性问题举行各种讲演会。各种项目的体育比赛和形式多样的民族艺术表演将是联欢节中最引人注目的活动。
    自从１９８７年２月决定在平壤举行本届联欢节以后，朝鲜劳动党和朝鲜政府就开始动员全国人民和青年紧张地投入了联欢节的筹备工作。为了给这次联欢节提供适当的活动场所，在平壤已建成了许多设备良好的体育设施、文化设施和服务性设施等。其中包括３座体育场、９座体育馆、３座旅馆，另外还有剧场、电影院、杂技场和一条长达６公里的光复大街。办好这次联欢节已成为朝鲜举国上下共同关心的一件大事。党、团组织和青年学生在居民中间广泛地进行宣传和讲演活动，动员工人、农民努力搞好生产。各级青年团体都在开展培养先进评先进的活动，在文艺、体育、生产、学习中获得优秀成绩的各行业青年人将被选派到平壤参加联欢的活动。全国城乡普遍地搞了一次清理街道房屋、美化社会环境的群众运动。平壤的青年学生们现在每天都在进行队列训练。在联欢节开幕的那一天，平壤市内的大同江畔和能容纳１５万名观众的“五·一体育场”（前称“绫罗岛体育场”，５月１日改为现名）内，将举行空前隆重的游行活动和大型团体操表演等。
    现在，距联欢节开幕还有２０天，但平壤市内已开始出现节日的气氛。文明好客的平壤人正等待各国青年朋友的到来。
