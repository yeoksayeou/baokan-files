Britain Unilaterally Delays Sino-British Meeting, Chinese Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Expresses Deep Regret

	BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) — The Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson today expressed deep regret over the British government's unilateral decision to delay the 13th meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group.

	The spokesperson made these remarks in response to a reporter's question.

	He said that according to the ninth paragraph of Annex II of the Sino-British Joint Declaration, the Joint Liaison Group should hold at least three meetings each year. This year, only one meeting has been held, the 12th meeting. During this meeting, both sides agreed to hold the 13th meeting in London from July 18 to 21.

	The Foreign Ministry spokesperson said that now the British government has unilaterally announced the delay of the 13th meeting of the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group, suspending the normal work of the Joint Liaison Group. We deeply regret the British government's irresponsible action. Any consequences that may arise from this can only be borne by the British government. We reserve the right to make further comments.

	He said, we hope the British government will consider the overall situation of Sino-British relations and, from the perspective of promoting Hong Kong's prosperity and stability, seriously implement the provisions of the Joint Declaration and adhere to the agreements between China and Britain regarding the work of the Joint Liaison Group.
