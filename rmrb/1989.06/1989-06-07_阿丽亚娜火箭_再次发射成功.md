The European Ariane rocket was successfully launched this morning at 00:36 from the Guiana Space Centre. This was its 31st launch. The rocket placed two communication satellites, one from Japan and one from West Germany, into Earth's orbit.

Due to technical issues, the originally scheduled launch date was postponed multiple times. The personnel responsible for the new super-large capacity 44L-type rocket anxiously awaited its ascent. A notable feature of this launch was the high standard achieved in resolving the noise issue during takeoff, which exceeded the designed maximum payload capacity by 3%. The Ariane rocket has maintained a streak of 12 consecutive successful launches since September 1987.

　　阿丽亚娜火箭
    再次发射成功
    本报巴黎６月５日电  欧洲阿丽亚娜火箭于今晨零点３６分在圭亚那发射中心再次发射成功，这是它们第３１次发射。火箭把日本和西德两颗通讯卫星送上了地球轨道。
    由于技术上的原因，原定发射日期一再推迟。负责这枚新型超大功能４４Ｌ型火箭的有关人员怀着焦急不安的心情期待火箭升空。这次发射的特点是，火箭起飞中的噪音问题解决达到了很高的水准，并超过了其设计最大载重量的３％，阿丽亚娜火箭自１９８７年９月以来的连续１２次发射成功。
