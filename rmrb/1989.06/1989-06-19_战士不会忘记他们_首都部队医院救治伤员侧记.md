Soldiers Will Never Forget Them
– A Side Story of the Capital Military Hospital Treating the Injured
By Lai Renqiong, People's Daily Reporter

On the night of June 3, a batch of military injured personnel were sent to the Beijing Military Region General Hospital. At 4 a.m. on June 4, the first medical team composed of excellent medical staff rushed to the front line to rescue the injured. On the way, one of their ambulances was smashed, and another was burned. Doctors and nurses were surrounded and attacked, with 2 beaten and 1 shot. However, they paid no heed to their own lives and deaths...

In the following days, the hospital rescued and treated thousands of injured personnel and admitted more than 200. During the period when transportation was disrupted, more than 400 medical staff who lived outside the hospital rushed from Mentougou, Xishan, Fengtai, and other places to participate in the rescue. Some walked more than 30 kilometers. On June 9, military leaders Hong Xuezhi, Liu Huaqing, and Qin Jiwei visited the hospital to see the injured personnel of the martial law troops. After learning about the situation of medical staff rescuing injured personnel on the front line, they said, "The Beijing Military Region General Hospital has the heaviest medical tasks and has completed them the best."

Located in the western suburbs of Beijing, the Fifth Department of the General Hospital of the People's Liberation Army began receiving injured personnel at 9:30 p.m. on June 3. Late at night, the number of injured personnel increased, and their conditions became more severe. The leadership and experts of the hospital formed a command group at the emergency department to direct the rescue operations. Injured personnel sent to the emergency department were quickly examined, classified, and received specialized examinations and treatments such as hemostasis and dressing. Those needing surgery were immediately sent to the operating room. All surgeons of the hospital were on duty, and 18 surgeries were performed simultaneously.

At a critical moment when some misinformed crowds attacked the outpatient building of the hospital, the hospital's cadres formed two rows of human walls to maintain the rescue passage. The director of the Medical Department, Zhu Shijun, said, "The condition of the injury is the order, and time is life. Injured personnel sent to the hospital were not delayed for even half a minute!" A seriously injured soldier needed a large amount of fresh blood. The drivers of the hospital's motor pool and the guards immediately lined up at the emergency department to donate blood. 5000 milliliters of fresh blood dripped into the soldier's veins. Eye specialists also went to various hospitals in Beijing for rounds and consultations, ensuring that some difficult and severe injured personnel received timely and effective treatment. The hospital treated injured personnel without any deaths due to improper treatment.

Wang Lihua, the platoon leader of a motorized platoon of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, was severely injured by rioters on the west side of the Xinhua Gate on the night of June 3 while protecting his platoon leader Liu Guocheng. He was transferred to the 304th Hospital of the People's Liberation Army. Here, he received meticulous treatment and care, and his body recovered quickly. On June 16, the reporter saw Wang Lihua, who was excitedly lying in bed and said, "I am deeply grateful to the doctors, nurses, and kind-hearted people in the capital. I will never forget them."

On the night of June 3, some people with ulterior motives threatened to storm the hospital, and many misinformed crowds gathered at the hospital gate. To ensure the smooth progress of the rescue work and the safety of the military injured personnel, dozens of hospital staff formed small teams to guard the gate. They also patiently propagated and explained to the crowds. When the onlookers saw that the injured personnel, whether military personnel or misinformed civilians, were all actively treated, they gradually dispersed. The hospital treated military and civilian personnel separately with two teams. When the hospital's blood supply and medicines were in short supply, the drivers of the motor pool braved the danger to go to the central blood station and other hospitals to fetch blood, glucose saline, and other supplies.

Although the medical staff of several military hospitals in the capital had taken off their military uniforms and changed to civilian status last year, they still demonstrated the discipline and style of the military in this rescue of the injured. Doctors and nurses said, "Even though we have taken off our military uniforms, we are still soldiers. In any situation, we must save lives, practice revolutionary humanitarianism. Serving the army and serving the people is the eternal mission of the people's army."

　　战士不会忘记他们
    ——首都部队医院救治伤员侧记
    本报记者  赖仁琼
    ６月３日深夜，一批部队伤员被送到北京军区总医院。４日凌晨，由优秀医护人员组成的第一支医疗队奔赴火线抢救伤员。行进途中，他们乘坐的救护车一辆被砸坏，一辆被烧毁，医生护士被围攻，２人被打，１人中弹。但他们置个人生死于不顾……
    连日来，该院抢救治疗伤员数千人，收住院２００多人。在交通中断期间，４００多名家住院外的医护人员从门头沟、香山、丰台等地赶到医院参加救护，有的步行３０多公里。６月９日，洪学智、刘华清、秦基伟等军委领导来院看望戒严部队伤员，当他们得知医护人员火线救治伤员的情况后说，北京军区总医院的医疗任务最重，完成任务最好。
    位于北京西郊五棵松的解放军总医院，从６月３日晚上９点多开始接收伤员。深夜，伤员越来越多，伤情越来越重。院领导和专家教授组成的指挥组在急救科现场指挥。送到急诊科的伤员，在最短的时间里得到初诊、分类、专科检查和止血、包扎等处理，需手术的立即送往手术室。该院外科医生全部到位，１８台手术同时展开。
    在部分不明真相的群众围攻医院门诊大楼的危急时刻，该院的干部们组成两排人墙，维护抢救通道。医务部主任朱士俊说：“伤情就是命令，时间就是生命。伤员送到医院，连半分钟也没有耽搁！”抢救一严重火击伤的战士需要大量新鲜血液，该院汽车队、警卫连的同志马上列队到急诊科献血，５０００毫升鲜血一滴滴流进了这个战士的血管。眼科的专家还到各驻京医院巡诊、会诊，使一些疑难重症伤员得到及时有效的治疗。该院收治的伤员中，无一例因治疗不当而死亡。
    解放军某部司机班班长樊利华，６月３日晚在新华门西侧为保护排长刘国庚而被暴徒打得遍体鳞伤，他转送到解放军３０４医院。在这里，他得到了精心的治疗、护理，身体恢复很快。６月１６日，记者见到樊利华，他在病床上激动地说：“我万分感谢首都的医生护士和好心的群众，我永远忘不了他们。”
    ６月３日晚，一些别有用心的人扬言要冲击医院，许多不明真相的群众也聚集在医院门口。为使救治工作顺利进行，确保部队伤员的安全，医院几十名同志组成小分队守卫大门，他们还耐心地向群众宣传、解释。当围观者看到陆续送来的伤员不管是军人还是误伤的群众，都得到了积极的救治，便纷纷散去。医院按军队、地方分开并由两套人马分别救治。当该院的血源、药品告急时，汽车队的司机冒着危险到市中心血站和其他医院拉来血液、葡萄糖盐水等。
    虽然首都数家部队医院的医务人员已在去年脱掉军装改为文职，但在这次救治伤员中却依然体现了军队的纪律和作风。医生护士说：“我们脱下军装还是兵，无论在任何情况下，都要救死扶伤，实行革命的人道主义。为部队服务，为人民服务，这永远是人民军队的宗旨。”
