On June 8th, these individuals were apprehended by public security personnel in accordance with the law.

These lawless individuals are a minority of unrehabilitated "released criminals and released detainees" and some young workers and idle social elements. On June 7th and 8th, they intercepted more than seventy vehicles of various types, then sat on the vehicles, carrying large banners, shouting slogans, seriously disrupting public order, and blocking traffic on most major roads.

　　沈阳市抓获一批拦截车辆人员
    沈阳市一些不法人员，乘大学生游行之机，混入游行队伍，随意堵截拦挡正常运行车辆、扰乱社会秩序，六月八日被公安人员依法抓获。
    这些不法人员是少数没改造好的“两劳”释放人员和一些青工及社会闲散人员，他们于六月七日、八日共拦截各种车辆七十余台，然后坐在车上，打着大旗，呼喊口号，严重扰乱了社会治安，堵塞了大部分重要路段交通。
