The European Commission Vice-President delivered a speech, urging the signing of the new Lomé Convention. Our correspondent Wei Wei reports from Brussels: On May 16, European Commission Vice-President Marlin pointed out that although the negotiations for the renewal of the Lomé Convention have made some progress, they "have not yet touched on the difficult points." He called on the member states of the European Community to abandon their tactical positions and show "patience, perseverance, and charm" to flexibly negotiate, with the aim of achieving greater progress at the next meeting of the Council of Ministers for Foreign Affairs.

Marlin made these remarks during a meeting of the Council for Cooperation and Development of the European Community. He believes that signing the fourth Lomé Convention still faces many difficulties, mainly in the amount of aid to developing countries in the non-African, Caribbean, and Pacific (ACP) regions and the methods to be adopted. For example, France and the Netherlands support increasing aid. Italy and some other countries, while agreeing to expand aid, refuse to make significant concessions on supplementary trade. The United Kingdom, on the other hand, advocates for concessions on trade and prefers to minimize aid.

The European Commission has always been relatively active in its attitude towards helping developing countries overcome the difficulties arising from economic structural adjustment. Currently, most member states believe that the Commission is too generous and are negotiating with the Commission's proposals on financial and trade matters.

　　欧共体委员会副主席发表讲话
    呼吁签署新洛美协定
    本报布鲁塞尔电  记者魏崴报道：５月１６日，欧洲共同体委员会副主席马林指出，续签《洛美协定》的谈判虽然取得了不少进展，但“尚未触及难点”，他呼吁欧共体诸成员国放弃各自的战术立场，表现出“耐心、坚韧和魅力”来，灵活磋商，以期在下一届外长理事会上取得更大进展。
    马林是在欧共体合作与发展理事会举行会议期间讲这番话的。他认为，签署第四个《洛美协定》还存在许多困难，主要是在援助非加太地区发展中国家的款额多寡和采取什么方式上，欧共体国家意见不一。例如，法国、荷兰赞成增加援款。意大利等一些国家虽同意扩大援助，但拒绝在补充贸易上作较大让步。而英国则主张在贸易上作让步，在援助上越少越好。
    欧共体委员会对于帮助发展中国家克服经济结构调整中出现的困难，态度一向比较积极。目前，大多数成员国认为委员会过于慷慨了，正在财政和贸易上，和委员会的建议讨价还价。
