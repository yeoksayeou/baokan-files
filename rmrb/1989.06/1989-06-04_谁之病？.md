	Who's to blame?
	Jiang Yongsheng
	Currently, a significant portion of the marriage expenses for young people is covered by their parents' "assistance." This is a fact and indeed a major social issue. However, to say that contemporary youth suffer from "soft-boned disease" and to place all the blame on them is, I believe, unfair.

	Contemporary youth are not all complacently accepting their parents' "assistance." More often, they do so out of necessity. Take myself as an example: In 1985, I graduated from university, and after becoming a formal employee, my monthly salary was 70 yuan. After deducting living expenses, there was hardly anything left. In nearly four years of work, I didn't save a single penny. My peers are in a similar situation (with a few "speculators" being the exception), and I rarely hear of anyone saving money. We all need to start a family, but with current prices, even the bare necessities of life cost at least 2,000 yuan. For those with low incomes, there's no choice but to shamefully accept the hard-earned money from our parents.

	Moreover, do the incomes of young people match their contributions? Although young people, as a whole, lag behind middle-aged and older individuals, they are actually taking on important work across various fronts and fields. Yet, they almost without exception earn less than their middle-aged and older counterparts. Everything is based on seniority and rank. When will it be the turn for young people to shine?

	As for the current competitive environment and the stage for young people to showcase their talents, I have to ask: Is this competition based on fairness? Can competition without connections, without backing, and without privileges be compared to competition with connections, with backing, and with privileges? With a rigid allocation system and an inflexible social environment, how can contemporary youth be provided with a stage to showcase their talents?

	Indeed, contemporary Chinese youth do lack a sense of independence, but a sense of independence requires corresponding objective social conditions. To criticize youth without considering social realities is unhelpful in solving the problem. If we follow this approach, it's like trying to catch a fish by climbing a tree.

　　谁之病？
    姜永生
    时下青年结婚费用大半依靠父母“资助”，这是事实，也的确成为一大社会公害，但据此就说当代青年患“软骨病”，把责任全都推到青年头上，我认为有失公允。
    当代青年并不都是心安理得接受父母“资助”的，更多的则是不得已而为之。以笔者为例，１９８５年大学毕业，转正后月工资７０元，每月除掉吃饭，所剩无几，工作近四年，竟未存下分文。而我的同龄人，平均工资水平也大致如此（个别“倒爷”除外），很少听说有人攒下钱的。我们总得成家，但按现在的物价，不敢高攀什么，仅生活必需品，没有２０００元能下来吗？对收入少的人来说，只好羞愧地接过父母的血汗钱。
    再说，青年的收入和付出成比例吗？虽然青年人在总体上和中老年人有差距，但青年实际上在各条战线、各个领域已经担负着重要工作，他们却几乎无一例外地比中老年人收入低。一切都论资排辈，何时才是青年人的出头之日？
    至于说现在有竞争的环境，有青年人施展才华的舞台，我要反问一句，这竞争是建立在公平的基础之上吗？没有门路，没有后台，没有特权的竞争和有门路，有后台，有特权的竞争能相提并论、同日而语吗？基本上的硬性分配加上难以流动的社会环境，又怎么能为当代青年提供施展才华的舞台？
    诚然，中国当代青年确实缺少自立意识，但自立意识的确需要有与之相适应的客观社会条件，脱离社会实际而一味指责青年，无助于问题的解决，若依此下药，则无异于缘木求鱼。
