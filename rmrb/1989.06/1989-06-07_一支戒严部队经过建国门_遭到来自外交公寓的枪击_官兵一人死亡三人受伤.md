A martial law unit passing through Jianguomen was shot at from the direction of the diplomatic compound and a building to the south of the road.

Today around 10 AM, as one of our martial law units was moving from east to west and passing near the Jianguomen overpass, they were shot at from two directions: the diplomatic compound outside Jianguomen and a building to the south of the road. This resulted in one soldier being killed and three injured. The unit was forced to return fire and temporarily surrounded the diplomatic compound and other buildings before quickly withdrawing.

The martial law unit demands that all foreigners and residents in Beijing strictly adhere to all relevant regulations issued by the martial law unit command. Under these circumstances, the martial law unit will be responsible for ensuring their safety.
