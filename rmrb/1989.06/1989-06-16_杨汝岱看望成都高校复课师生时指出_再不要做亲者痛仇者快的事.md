	Yang Ruidai, a member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and Secretary of the Sichuan Provincial Committee, along with other responsible comrades, visited Chengdu University and Sichuan University yesterday afternoon to visit teachers and students returning to classes and to understand the situation of the schools.

	The counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing also affected Chengdu. Currently, some universities have started classes, and the attendance rate at Chengdu University has reached 88%.

	After listening to the introduction of the situation of protecting the school and resuming classes at Sichuan University, Yang Ruidai and other comrades said that some students took extreme actions such as parades, demonstrations, and hunger strikes, which are easily exploited by a few people with ulterior motives. The turmoil and rebellion in Beijing, and the chaos of looting and arson created by a small group of criminals in Chengdu, are worth our deep reflection. This is a bloody lesson. Yang Ruidai encouraged teachers and students to seriously study the important speech of Comrade Xiaoping, to clearly support the correct decision of the Party Central Committee, and not to do things that are contrary to one's wishes, causing pain to loved ones and joy to enemies. They should strive to learn and better complete the learning tasks given by the Party and the people, and cultivate themselves into qualified talents for building socialism.

　　杨汝岱看望成都高校复课师生时指出
    再不要做亲者痛仇者快的事
    本报成都６月１６日电  记者罗茂城报道：中共中央政治局委员、四川省委书记杨汝岱等负责同志，昨天下午先后前往成都大学、四川大学，看望复课的师生员工，了解学校情况。
    北京发生的反革命暴乱也涉及到成都。目前，有的大学已开始复课，成都大学上课率已达８８％。
    杨汝岱等同志听了四川大学师生护校和复课情况的介绍后说，一些同学采取游行、示威、绝食等过激行动，很容易被少数别有用心的人所利用。北京的学潮发展成动乱、暴乱，成都一小撮犯罪分子制造打砸抢烧的骚乱，值得我们深思，这是血的教训。杨汝岱勉励师生认真学习小平同志的重要讲话，旗帜鲜明地支持党中央的英明决策，再不要去做那些事与愿违、亲者痛仇者快的事，努力学习，更好地完成党和人民交给的学习任务，把自己培养成建设社会主义的合格人才。
