	Thai Foreign Minister Siddhi Savetsila said today that he has proposed to hold an international conference on the Cambodian issue as soon as possible to reach an agreement on establishing a committee to supervise the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia and to hold elections in Cambodia.

	Siddhi made the remarks upon his return to Bangkok after completing his European tour and participating in a conference on refugee issues held in Geneva. He said he had consulted with the French Foreign Minister on this matter. He estimated that 20 countries would participate in the international conference on the Cambodian issue to be held in France in July or August this year. Siddhi said that after this conference, two working group meetings would be held to address issues such as the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops from Cambodia, the establishment of an international monitoring mechanism, the maintenance of stability, and the formation of a temporary government in Cambodia.
