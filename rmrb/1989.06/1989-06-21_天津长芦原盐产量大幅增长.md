The Tianjin Changlu Salt Region has already produced 150 million tons of raw salt, an increase of 33 percent compared to the same period last year. Among these, the Tanggu Salt Field has already completed its annual production plan of 102 million tons of raw salt ahead of schedule.

The Changlu Salt Region is an important salt production base in China. Since March, the salt workers here have taken advantage of the favorable production conditions of this spring's drought and little rain. They have seized the opportunity to produce brine, strengthen crystallization management, and accelerate the salt extraction process. As a result, spring production has shown a good momentum that has been rare in recent years.

　　天津长芦原盐产量大幅增长
    新华社天津六月二十一日电（记者张宏文）天津长芦盐区现已生产原盐一百五十万吨，比去年同时增长百分之三十三，其中塘沽盐均已提前完成一百零二万吨原盐的全年生产计划。
    长芦盐区是我国重要海盐生产基地。今年三月以来，这里的广大盐工抓住今春天旱少雨的有利生产条件，不失时机地赶制卤水，加强结晶管理，狠抓扒盐进度，春晒生产出现了近几年少有的好势头。
