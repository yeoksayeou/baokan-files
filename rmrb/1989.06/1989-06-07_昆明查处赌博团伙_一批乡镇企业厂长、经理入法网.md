	Kunming Cracks Down on Gambling Ring
		Several Town and Township Enterprise Directors and Managers Fall into the Legal Net

	Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, June 7 - Kunming City recently held a meeting to publicly handle 19 individuals from township enterprises, street-level industries, and private enterprises who participated in organized gambling and committed illegal and criminal acts. Among them, 5 were arrested by law, and 14 were sent to labor re-education.

	This gambling ring was uncovered by police from the Lianhua Substation of the Kunming Public Security Bureau earlier this year. These directors and managers included some who were Communist Party members, labor models, and district people's congress representatives. Since last October, they had been gambling with stakes ranging from several thousand yuan to tens of thousands of yuan in cash. Some even used gold and cars as stakes. When some lost, they would immediately write checks from their enterprises to pay off their gambling debts.

　　昆明查处赌博团伙
    一批乡镇企业厂长、经理入法网
    新华社昆明６月７日电  昆明市最近召开大会，对参加团伙赌博的违法犯罪的１９名乡镇企业街道工业和私营企业的厂长、经理进行公开处理，其中５人被依法逮捕，１４人被劳动教养。
    这个赌博团伙是今年初被昆明市公安局莲华派出所的公安干警破获的。这些厂长、经理，有的是共产党员，有的是劳动模范，有的是区人大代表。自去年１０月以来，在赌博中，他们竟以数千元以至上万元的现金作赌资，有的人还以黄金、轿车作赌资；有的人赌输了，当场填写本企业的支票支付赌债。
