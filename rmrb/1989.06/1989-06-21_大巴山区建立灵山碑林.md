A modern calligraphy stele forest was completed in the Ling Shan area of the Daba Mountains just before the May Day holiday this year. Located about 20 kilometers northwest of the city of Bazhong, this area has been a significant site for Buddhism and Taoism since the Sui and Tang dynasties, with 13 temples and hundreds of statues built over the centuries. Currently, it has been designated by the Sichuan Provincial Government as a tourist attraction along the Shu Road tourism line.

With the contributions of nearly a thousand calligraphy masters from home and abroad, the Ling Shan Stele Forest showcases over 2,000 pieces of calligraphy, with 1,300 steles already erected, making it the fourth-largest stele forest in China.

　　大巴山区建立灵山碑林
    在千里大巴山区阴灵山，今年“五一”前夕建成一座现代书法碑林。这里位于巴中县城西北二十余公里，自隋唐以来曾先后成为佛、道教重地，修庙宇十三座，塑神像数百尊。目前，已被四川省人民政府划为蜀道旅游线上的一个旅游点。
    千家书艺到，灵山分外娇。灵山碑林荟萃了近几年来中外一千多位名人书家奉献的墨宝二千余幅，已建成书碑一千三百块，成为中国的第四大碑林。
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（张崇渔）
