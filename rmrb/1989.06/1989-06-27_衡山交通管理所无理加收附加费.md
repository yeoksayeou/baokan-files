Recently, the Ministry of Forestry allocated two special-use vehicles to our bureau for forest protection and fire prevention, as well as to stop illegal logging. In mid-March, our bureau sent two drivers to Tianjin to pick up the vehicles. After obtaining the vehicles, they returned to Kunming on March 19, passing through Tianjin, Hebei, Henan, and Hubei. Along the way, they were inspected multiple times, but because their documents were complete, they passed without any issues. On the afternoon of March 27, the two vehicles arrived in Hengshan County, Hunan. The Hengshan County Traffic and Transportation Management Bureau stopped the vehicles for inspection. The drivers immediately handed over the purchase invoice, purchase tax receipt, and other documents. However, the inspectors, Wang Qiuyuan and others, looked at these documents and said, “The purchase price of these two vehicles is too low; you need to pay an additional purchase fee of 7,292 yuan.” The two drivers repeatedly explained, but the relevant inspectors not only did not listen but also impounded the vehicles and threatened, “You have three days to pay this fee, otherwise, it will be tripled!”

The two drivers had no choice but to leave one vehicle as collateral and drove the other back to the Hunan Provincial Forestry Bureau to borrow the cash. They then rushed back to Hengshan to pay this “additional fee.” Only then were the two vehicles allowed to continue.

According to the drivers, the Hengshan County Traffic and Transportation Management Bureau has been impounding passing new vehicles, arbitrarily setting their own collection standards, and forcibly collecting fees, which seriously violates the Ministry of Communications' regulations regarding the collection of vehicle purchase additional fees.

　　衡山交通管理所无理加收附加费
    最近，林业部调拨给我厅两辆用于护林防火、制止乱砍滥伐的专用车。３月中旬，我厅派两位驾驶员赶赴天津取车。他们取到车后，便于３月１９日返回昆明，途经天津、河北、河南、湖北，沿途多次受检查，都因手续齐备，一路绿灯。３月２７日下午，这两辆车到了湖南衡山县。衡山县交通运输管理所拦车检查，驾驶员当即交上购车发票、购置附加税收据以及其它手续。可是，检查人员王秋元等人看了这些证明后，说：“这两辆车购价太便宜，要补交购置附加费７２９２元。”两位驾驶员反复向他们解释，但有关检查人员不但不听，反将车扣下，并威胁说：“限你们３天内交齐这笔费用，否则加罚３倍！”
    两位驾驶员没有办法，只得留下一辆车作抵押，开着另一辆车赶到湖南省林业厅借了现金，连夜赶回衡山交了这笔“附加费”。这样，两辆车才得以放行。
    据驾驶员反映，衡山县交通运输管理所扣留过往的新车，擅自另立收费标准，强行收费，严重违反了交通部有关征收车辆购置附加费的规定。
