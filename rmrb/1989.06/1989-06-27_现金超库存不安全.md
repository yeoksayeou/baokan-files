On the nights of March 16th and 18th, five safes in our county were burglarized, resulting in a loss of 32,300 yuan in cash. Shortly afterward, five safes in Bo County and Wudi County were also pried open.

The burglary of safes caused significant losses and should serve as a warning: on one hand, we should not blindly trust safes; on the other hand, cash storage should be kept within the prescribed limits and minimized as much as possible. According to a survey by the banking department, the phenomenon of units exceeding the prescribed limits for cash storage is widespread across the country. Over 80% of units have cash storage that exceeds the prescribed limits by several times or even tens of times. Some unit leaders believe that keeping large amounts of cash in safes makes business transactions more convenient and can also help evade bank supervision. They think this is a clever move. However, this practice not only violates cash management regulations but also provides opportunities for criminals.

We hope that all units will, while strengthening their own security work, strictly implement cash management regulations.

### 现金超库存不安全

　　现金超库存不安全
    ３月１６日和１８日夜间，我县有５个单位的保险柜被盗，损失现金３．２３万元。后不久，博兴、无棣两县又有５只保险柜被撬开。
    保险柜被撬，损失不小，应引起人们的警惕：一方面不能迷信保险柜；另一方面现金库存只能在规定限额以下，尽量少留。据银行部门调查，单位现金库存超过规定限额的现象在全国很普遍，８０％以上的单位现金库存超过规定限额几倍甚至几十倍。有的单位领导人认为这样做，办理业务往来时方便，同时还可逃避银行监督，就把大笔现金存放在保险柜内，自以为得计。殊不知，这样做不仅违反现金管理制度，而且给不法分子以可乘之机。
    希望各单位在加强本单位的安全保卫工作的同时，严格执行现金管理制度。
