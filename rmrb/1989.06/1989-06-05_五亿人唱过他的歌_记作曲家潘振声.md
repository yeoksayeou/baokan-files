	Five Hundred Million People Have Sung His Songs
	– A Profile of Composer Pan Zhensheng
	By Xinhua News Agency reporter Chuxingxi

	“Where is spring? Where is spring?…” In the famous children’s song “Dili Dili,” renowned music composer Pan Zhensheng uses lively and cheerful melodies to bring the beauty of spring into every child’s heart.

	In 1955, at the age of 27, Pan Zhensheng composed the beloved children’s song “Little Duckling.” The parents who taught this song to their children back then have now become grandparents; the children who learned “Little Duckling” have grown up to become parents themselves. In a society where four generations coexist, three generations have sung his children’s songs—this is a massive group of 500 million people.

	Pan Zhensheng’s songs have accompanied the growth of children in New China. In the 1950s, his children’s song “Little Duckling” was popular; in the 1960s, it was “One Cent”; in the 1970s, it was “Good Mother”; and in the 1980s, it was “Dili Dili.” Times are constantly changing, but he has always been at the forefront of children’s song creation.

	Pan Zhensheng’s children’s songs have beautiful melodies and vivid, accurate imagery, exerting an irresistible attraction that resonates in the hearts of children. “I picked up one cent on the street,” immediately evokes the image of children’s activities. In March 1965, after this song was first broadcast on the Central People’s Radio Station’s Little Trumpet program, it received over a hundred letters from children within a week. In the song “One Cent,” the image of the honest “Little Lei Feng” became the role model for millions of children.

	In his children’s song lyrics, Pan Zhensheng is skilled at “making big topics small.” He transforms the love for the country and love for labor into small matters like loving animals and plants, based on children’s psychological and physiological characteristics. “Little Duckling” cultivates children’s love for labor and hometown, and ultimately their love for the country, through the emotional bond between children and small poultry. When composing, Pan Zhensheng “makes small topics big.” He exaggerates the unique intonations of children’s language with humor. In the song “Dili Dili,” he uses the technique of alternating high and low notes to repeatedly emphasize the sound of the little yellow bird, allowing children to associate the beautiful music with the beauty of spring.

	Pan Zhensheng understands and loves children. At 57 years old, his childlike heart remains undiminished. When he is with children, every expression, every gesture, carries a childlike charm.

### 五亿人唱过他的歌——记作曲家潘振声

　　五亿人唱过他的歌
    ——记作曲家潘振声
    新华社记者  褚庆喜
    “春天在哪里？春天在哪里？……”著名音乐作曲家潘振声在这支名为儿童《嘀哩嘀哩》的儿童歌曲里，通过活泼欢快的歌声，将美丽的春天播进每个孩子的心田。
    １９５５年，２７岁的潘振声创作了脍炙人口的儿歌《小鸭子》。当年给孩子教唱这首歌的爸爸妈妈们，如今变成了爷爷奶奶；当年学唱《小鸭子》的孩子们也都成了爸爸妈妈。在四代循环的社会里，有三代人唱过他写的儿歌——这是一支５亿人的庞大队伍。
    潘振声的歌伴随着新中国儿童们长大。５０年代流行他的儿歌《小鸭子》，６０年代流行他的儿歌《一分钱》，７０年代流行他的儿歌《好妈妈》，８０年代流行他的儿歌《嘀哩嘀哩》。时代在不断的变化，而他却始终搏弄着儿歌创作的潮流。
    潘振声的儿歌旋律优美，形象鲜明准确，用不容置疑的吸引力，在孩子们心灵中产生共鸣。“我在马路边捡到一分钱”，一听就是孩子们的事情。１９６５年３月，这首儿歌在中央人民广播电台小喇叭节目第一次播出后，一周内便收到孩子们的来信上百封。在《一分钱》的歌声中，拾金不昧的“小雷锋”成了千万个孩子的心灵偶象。
    在儿歌歌词创作中，潘振声善于“大题小作”。他根据孩子们的心理和生理特征，把爱祖国爱劳动的大道理化进爱动物、爱花草的小事中。《小鸭子》便是通过孩子和小家禽的感情，培养儿童们爱劳动、爱家乡，进而爱祖国的美好情操。在谱曲时，潘振声则“小题大作”。他根据孩子语言所特有的音调加以趣味性的夸张。在《嘀哩嘀哩》这首儿歌里，用高、低音序变换的手法，反来复去地强调小黄莺的叫声，使孩子们在优美动听的音乐中产生对春天的美好联想。
    潘振声熟悉孩子、热爱孩子，５７岁的人了，一颗童心依然不泯。和孩子们在一起时，一颦一笑，举手投足，都带着一股“孩子气”。
