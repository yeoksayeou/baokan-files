Stability has increasingly become the consensus of Shanghai's 12 million people. In recent days, despite severe difficulties in various sectors, Shanghai's industrial, financial, and commercial workers have prioritized the overall situation, overcome challenges, maintained production, and ensured normal life.

Starting from June 4, Shanghai's main transportation routes were blocked, and all public transportation within the city was suspended. To ensure attendance, many workers walked to their factories and shops. Some workers had to walk for several hours between their homes and workplaces. To arrive at their posts early, they left home at 3 a.m. Many people's feet and legs became swollen. The staff of the Municipal Telephone Bureau's suburban office and various telephone sub-bureaus, as well as the wireless paging center's operators, were almost all present. From June 4 to June 7, the attendance rate of factories and enterprises in the city remained between 60% and 70%, and on June 8, it reached over 85%.

Due to transportation disruptions, some factories could not receive raw materials and parts, and finished products could not be shipped out, threatening production. Various enterprises did everything possible to rush deliveries, ensuring normal production operations. On the night of June 4, the transportation companies of Hunan, Hubei, and Huaxi, along with the chemical industry, dispatched 8 teams with 55 trucks to rush-deliver coal, chemical reagents, and various production materials for the textile and chemical industries overnight. Among these, 3,127 tons of coal, 285 tons of chemical reagents, and 48 tons of salt were delivered, solving the urgent needs of 15 textile enterprises and 9 chemical enterprises. In nearly five days of transportation paralysis, only a few enterprises in Shanghai stopped production or operated at half capacity, and the city's industrial production remained basically normal.

Workers on the water, electricity, gas, grain, and food supply lines fought tirelessly, maintaining their posts and production, ensuring that the normal life of the city's residents was not affected. Many factory workers got up in the middle of the night, walked to the factory to take over their shifts; some workers who were hospitalized did not heed the doctor's advice and returned to the factory to work. The attendance rate of various water plants in the city remained above 85%, ensuring the quality and quantity of water supply. The night-shift workers of various power plants and power supply companies maintained their posts, ensuring normal power supply. The three gas plants of the Municipal Gas Company worked around the clock, continuously supplying household gas. The staff of the liquefied gas management office also worked overnight to fill and deliver bottles, maintaining the supply of liquefied gas for civilian use. Food industry workers found ways to purchase and transport various vegetables and tofu products, ensuring a stable market supply. The grain system workers dispatched 82 trucks to deliver grain to stores, ensuring the supply of grain to residents.

　　稳定大局成为上海人民的共识
    广大职工克服困难坚持生产保障生活
    新华社上海６月１０日电  “稳定大局”越来越成为上海１２００万人民的共识。连日来，在各方面出现严重困难的情况下，上海工交、财贸战线的广大职工坚持以大局为重，克服困难，坚持生产，保障生活。
    从６月４日开始，上海的主要交通干线路障重重，市内公交线路全部停驶。为了坚持出勤，许多职工步行到厂、到店。有些职工住处与单位之间距离较远，有的要走几个小时。他们为了早到岗位，凌晨３时就从家里出门，不少人把脚、腿都走肿了。市电话局市郊台和各电话分局的话务、机务人员绝大多数到岗，无线传呼台的话务员也全部到岗。从６月４日到６月７日，全市工厂企业的出勤率始终保持在６０％至７０％，６月８日达到８５％以上。
    因为运输受阻，一些工厂原材料和配件进不来，产成品出不去，给生产造成威胁。各企业千方百计突击抢运，保证生产正常运行。６月４日夜，沪南、沪东、沪西和化工运输公司派出８个车队共５５辆货车，为纺织、化工系统夜间抢运煤炭、化学试剂和各种生产物资，其中抢运煤炭３１２７吨，化学试剂２８５吨，食盐４８吨，为１５个纺织企业、９个化工企业解决了燃眉之急。在交通瘫痪近５天的情况下，上海只有少数企业先后停产和半停产，全市工业生产基本保持了正常运转。
    奋战在水、电、煤气以及粮运、副食品等战线上的职工，以高度的责任感坚守岗位，坚持生产，使广大市民的正常生活基本未受影响。许多工厂职工半夜起来，徒步赶到厂里接班；有的职工本来患病住院，也不顾医生劝说，离院赶往工厂上岗。全市各水厂出勤率均保持在８５％以上，做到保质保量供水。各发电厂、供电公司的夜班职工坚守岗位，做到接班工人不到不下岗，保证了正常发供电。市煤气公司的３家煤气厂夜班连早班，早班连中班，把生活用煤气源源不断地送往各家各户。液化气管理所职工还连夜灌气送瓶，维持民用液化气供应。副食品行业职工想方设法采购、运送各种蔬菜、豆制品，做到市场上菜多价稳。粮食系统职工出动８２辆卡车送粮进店，保障了居民的粮食供应。
