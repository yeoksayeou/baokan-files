Due to drought and lack of rain, Heilongjiang Province has approximately 15 million mu of farmland that cannot be sown. About one-quarter of the rice fields cannot be transplanted, and one-third of the transplanted fields are struggling to withstand the scorching heat. Many seedlings have already withered, and some fields, although sown, have seeds that cannot germinate.

Heilongjiang has not seen a single heavy rain this spring. Many small and medium-sized rivers have dried up, water reserves in reservoirs have significantly decreased, and the water level in wells has generally dropped by three to four meters. Some lands have already cracked. In the severely drought-affected areas of Qiqihar City, 11 suburban counties have over 4 million mu of farmland that have been sown but have no seedlings.

The provincial and county leaderships are organizing large numbers of government officials to go to the countryside to help with anti-drought efforts, sowing, and replanting. Local supply and marketing cooperatives are expediting the allocation of anti-drought materials to the front lines. Financial and banking departments will also advance the release of agricultural funds for the third quarter.

　　黑龙江遇旱灾欠播缺苗较多
    本报哈尔滨六月十一日电  记者武培真报道：由于干旱少雨，黑龙江省约有一千五百万亩大田无法播种；四分之一稻田不能播秧，三分之一已播秧田难以经受高温烈日的烘烤；许多禾苗已经枯死；有些大田虽已播下，但种子不能吐芽。
    黑龙江今春未下一场透雨，大批中小河流断流，水库储水大幅度减少，水井水位普遍下降三四米，有些土地已经龟裂。旱情严重的齐齐哈尔市的十一个郊县，有四百多万亩大田播后无苗。黑龙江省地县各级领导机关正组织大批机关干部下乡帮助抗旱，播种补苗。各地供销部门正加紧调拨抗旱物资供应第一线。财政金融部门亦将第三季度农用款项提前发放。
