The largest agricultural investment project in Shenzhen, the construction of the West Sea Dike in Bao'an County, has begun with an investment of over 14 million yuan. The new dike, which is 26.54 kilometers long, is planned to be completed in three years with a total investment of 60 million yuan, and fully improved within five years.

The West Sea Dike is located on the eastern shore of the Pearl River estuary, facing the Lingding Sea. The dike starts from the mouth of the Maozhou River in Shajing to the west of the Dazhou Island in Xixiang (Xixiang River mouth). Inside the dike are the towns of Shajing, Fuyong, and Xinan (Xixiang), with a total population of approximately 200,000 residents. The protected farmland and ponds within the dike cover an area of 90,000 acres.

The old West Sea Dike has a low construction standard and has been eroded by years of typhoons and heavy rains, making the dike body thin and the surface low. During typhoons and storm surges, the dike often experiences flooding and breaches, seriously threatening the agricultural and industrial production and the safety of people's lives and property along the coast. In 1987, the "5.20" flood caused severe flooding, resulting in economic losses of over 67 million yuan. Therefore, the comprehensive improvement of the West Sea Dike is an urgent task to adapt to the development of Bao'an County's western region's export-oriented and foreign exchange-earning agriculture.

　　宝安新建西海堤动工
    投资六千万元　计划三年完成
    本报讯  深圳市农业投资最多、工程量最大的项目——宝安县西海堤建设，已投入１４００多万元，开始动工。据了解，新海堤总长２６．５４公里，计划投资共６０００万元，３年成堤，５年完善。
    西海堤位于珠江口东岸，濒临伶仃洋，堤线北起沙井茅州河口，南至西乡大王洲（西乡河口），海堤内有沙井、福永、新安（西乡）等镇，区域常住和暂住人口约２０万人，受保护农田和池塘达９万亩。
    旧的西海堤填筑标准不高，加上历年台风暴雨的冲刷和剥蚀，造成堤身单薄，堤面低矮，每逢台风暴潮到来便出现漫堤毁堤现象，严重威胁沿线乡镇工农业生产和人民生命财产安全。１９８７年“５·２０”山洪暴发，海潮顶托，造成严重的洪涝灾害，经济损失达６７００多万元。因此，全面整治西海堤是适应宝安县西片外向型创汇型农业发展的迫切任务。
