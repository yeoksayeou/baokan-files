Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 15th.

China's policy and principles for marine oil cooperation with foreign entities will remain unchanged. Already signed contracts will continue to be executed, and established cooperative relationships will continue to develop. This was emphasized by a senior official of the China National Offshore Oil Corporation (CNOOC) in a recent interview with a reporter from this newspaper.

The official stated that marine oil cooperation with foreign entities has been largely unaffected by the counter-revolutionary riot that occurred in Beijing. Production and operations in various sea areas are proceeding normally. Currently, there are 13 drilling rigs operating at sea, with 7 of them in cooperative areas. The oil fields that have already started production, such as the Sino-Japanese cooperative Chennan Oil Field and Bohai 28-1 Oil Field, as well as the Sino-French cooperative Tuo 10-3 Oil Field, are all operating normally. In the Bohai Sea and South China Sea, Chinese and foreign partners are jointly drilling exploration wells, production wells, and evaluation wells. The first-line operations in the Bohai Sea, East China Sea, and West China Sea are being carried out by foreign personnel who are working normally on their posts. Currently, there are 184 foreign experts continuing to execute oil contracts in China, 23 providing technical services, and 53 experts have been hired.

It is reported that a few days ago, foreign representatives of oil companies temporarily left Beijing, but none of the companies have closed their offices, nor have any requested to terminate contracts. The business of marine oil cooperation has not stopped. In the past few days, since the riot was suppressed and order in Beijing has gradually been restored, some foreign company representatives who left Beijing have called to express their desire to return as soon as possible. The representative of the Shell Oil Company in Beijing and the General Manager in Hong Kong called from Hong Kong to the senior official of CNOOC, expressing their intention to return to Beijing soon. The Chairman of the Eastern Company of Amoco Oil Corporation in the United States stated that despite the situation in China, it does not affect cooperation between the two parties, and they will continue to cooperate with the China National Offshore Oil Corporation in the South China Sea. Previously, there were rumors that the Beijing office of Arco Company had withdrawn from China. Recently, Arco Company, as well as the Sun Company and Phillips Company from the United States, have expressed to the media that their cooperation with China's offshore oil will not be affected by the situation in China. The representative of BP Company in Beijing also expressed the desire to return to work in Beijing as soon as possible.

　　我海洋石油对外合作方针不变
    各海域生产作业正常，已签合同将继续执行
    本报北京６月１５日讯  中国海洋石油对外合作的方针、政策不会改变，已签订的合同将继续执行，已建立的合作关系将继续发展。这是中国海洋石油总公司负责人日前在此间向本报记者强调的。
    这位负责人说，海洋石油对外合作基本未受发生在北京的反革命暴乱的影响，各海域的生产和作业正常。目前，有１３部钻机在海上作业，其中有７部钻机在合作区内。已投产的中日合作的埕北油田、渤中２８—１油田，中法合作的涠１０—３油田生产正常。渤海、南海海域中外双方正在钻探井、生产井和评价井。渤海、南海东部和西部石油公司第一线作业的外国人在岗位上照常工作。目前，继续在华执行石油合同的外国专家有１８４人，提供技术服务的专家有２３人，聘请专家５３人。
    据介绍，前几天，外国石油公司驻京外籍代表暂时离京，但没有一家撤销办事处，也没有一家要求中止合同，海洋石油的对外合作业务一直未停。这几天，暴乱平息，北京秩序逐渐恢复，一些离京的外国公司驻京人员来电表示要尽早返回。英国壳牌石油公司驻京代表、驻香港总经理从香港打电话给海洋石油总公司负责人，表示将于近日回京。美国阿莫科石油公司东方公司董事长表示，尽管中国发生了一些情况，并不影响双方的合作，我们要在南海同中国海洋石油公司继续合作。前一时期传言美国阿科公司驻京办事处从中国撤离。最近，阿科公司以及美国的太阳公司、菲利普斯公司对报界表示同中国海上石油的合作不受中国国内发生的事情影响。英国ＢＰ公司驻京代表也表达了尽早返京工作的愿望。
