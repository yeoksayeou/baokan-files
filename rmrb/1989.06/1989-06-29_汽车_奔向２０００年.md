The development of automobiles is advancing rapidly. In the past 20 years, the global average annual increase has been 2.5%, with the current number of cars reaching 500 million. The development trend for the next 10 years remains promising. Some developed countries' automobile manufacturers have already begun researching cars for the next century. Recently, the "Automobile Research Discussion for the Year 2000" and the "Man and Automobile" exhibition held in Paris revealed this trend.

	Functional Diversity

	The cars racing toward the year 2000 are no longer just tools for transportation. Automobile manufacturers from various countries are sparing no effort to develop "future cars," "all-purpose cars," and "intelligent cars," endowing automobiles with diverse functions. A new model designed by a Japanese automobile factory has become a "space" for the owner's life and work. The driver can, while driving, make phone calls for work, watch television news and commercial information, and send and receive fax documents. At the same time, the driver can operate the washing machine at home, control the stove in the kitchen to simmer chicken, and command a robot to clean the house. Is it safe to drive like this? No, because the driving route has been programmed into the computer, and the car is always on the optimal route. Even if an unexpected situation arises, the computer will issue a warning signal in advance.

	Various countries' automobile manufacturers, when developing future cars, have more fully and universally applied electronic technology and micro-engineering to automobiles. This multifunctional car is undoubtedly a sign of the leap in automobile technology in the new century.

	More Fuel-Efficient

	Everyone knows that a significant portion of the world's oil is consumed by cars on the roads. The idea of extracting hydrogen from solar energy to use as fuel, as proposed by the BMW automobile factory in West Germany, is indeed good, but it is not something that can be widely promoted in the short term. Under current conditions, fuel efficiency is the most practical method. According to a survey, 62% of people in the Western market still hope to buy fuel-efficient cars.

	Automobiles save fuel through two methods: improving the internal engine and enhancing the aerodynamic design of the exterior. At the automobile exhibition, people first notice the "strange-looking" car models. All manufacturers are striving to achieve new results in aerodynamics, industrial art, and engineering design because these are the main ways to reduce resistance and save fuel. The "Mesta" four-seater designed by Renault Automobile has a low fuel consumption, which is primarily due to its nearly monolithic aerodynamic design. Experts believe that fuel-efficient cars will not only have a market in developed countries but also in other regions of the world. They will undoubtedly occupy an important position in the future development of the automobile industry.

	Reducing Metal Materials

	In terms of the materials used in automobiles, reducing the metal content is a problem that needs to be continuously solved. It is not possible to make a "fully plastic car" by the year 2000, but some newly designed models already have 30% non-metallic components. Compared to metal, materials like plastic have advantages such as easy molding, low cost, and light weight. Currently, each car has an average of only 60 kilograms of non-metallic parts, accounting for 8% of the total weight and 10% of the cost. This indicates that there is great potential for innovation in automobile materials. With the development of the chemical industry and other fields, the material composition of cars by the year 2000 will undoubtedly be more diverse and reasonable.

	Increasing Safety

	In recent years, the number of people dying in car accidents worldwide has reached approximately 400,000 per year, the highest among all types of accident fatalities. Given that the number of cars is continuously increasing and the problems with road facilities and management are difficult to solve in the short term, the demand for the future automobile industry is to increase safety. According to a survey on improving car performance, more than 80% of people demand strengthened safety measures. In recent years, many automobile manufacturers have been actively promoting new technologies such as four-wheel steering and four-wheel drive to improve braking performance and ensure safe driving on snowy and rainy roads. Last year, in Western Europe, orders for four-wheel drive cars reached 180,000. Another factor in safety is the reliance on electronic devices. In 1980, there were 1.5 million cars worldwide equipped with electronic devices, and by 1984, this number had increased to 8 million. In the next ten years, this number will undoubtedly increase even more significantly.

	Mid-Range Luxury Cars

	As the performance and quality of cars continue to improve, more people are pursuing luxury cars. According to this market trend, manufacturers are planning a blueprint for the "mid-range luxury" of high-end cars, transferring some of the equipment that serves high-end luxury cars to mid-range cars. According to statistics, after mid-range cars are upgraded, their prices may increase by 40%. However, due to quality assurance, users will benefit from maintenance, repairs, and fuel savings, which can at least offset 20% of the expenditure. Therefore, from the perspective of safety and comfort, more customers will purchase mid-to-high-end cars with high-end equipment in the future.

	Globalized Production

	The competition in the automobile industry and product market has always been intense. After years of continuous division, reorganization, and mergers, ten major automobile groups have already formed in Western Europe, the United States, and Japan, and they are currently developing in a more complex "globalized" direction. A cross-industry, cross-enterprise, and cross-national collaboration is spreading worldwide.

	Due to the long product update cycle and high research costs, collaborative research and development of new products have been elevated to a higher level. The "intelligent car" jointly developed by France, West Germany, Sweden, and other Western European countries has concentrated the efforts of 14 automobile factories, 2,000 electrical factories, 50 universities, and research institutes.

	Japan's competition with the United States and Western Europe has entered a higher level. More than half of Japan's automobiles are exported, accounting for more than one-third of the U.S. market. In recent years, taking advantage of the approaching European unified market, Japan has preemptively established factories in countries such as the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, and Portugal, producing and selling locally. Currently, Japan exports 1.3 million cars to Western Europe annually.

	Major automobile-producing countries are expanding their markets to the Third World. France and Japan have already jointly established factories in Mexico. People believe that the automobile industry heading towards the year 2000 will follow a path filled with global competition.

　　汽车　奔向２０００年
    本报记者  张启华
    汽车的发展日新月异，近２０年来，世界年均增加２．５％，目前已达５亿辆车。未来１０年，发展趋势依然看好，一些发达国家的汽车制造商，已着手研制下个世纪初的汽车。不久前，在巴黎举行的公元２０００年汽车研究讨论会和《人与汽车》展览会揭示了这一发展趋势。
    　　　　功能多元化
    奔向２０００年的汽车，已不仅仅是代步的工具。各国汽车制造商使出浑身解数研制“未来车”、“全能车”、“智慧车”，赋予汽车多元化的功能。日本汽车厂设计的一部新型车，成了车主生活、工作的“场所”，驾车人在开车过程中，一会儿通过电话联系工作，一会儿收看电视新闻和商业信息，还可以收发传真资料。与此同时，驾车人还在操纵家里的洗衣机、掌握厨房间电炉炖鸡的火候，指挥机器人打扫卫生……这样开车不危险吗？不，因为他的行车路线已编入电脑，汽车一直处在最佳的路线上，即使临时遇到意外，电脑也会提前发出警告信号。
    各国汽车制造商在研制未来车时，把电子技术和微型工艺更充分、普遍地应用到汽车上，这种多功能的汽车无疑是新世纪汽车技术飞跃发展的一个标志。
    　　　　更加省油
    人们知道，现在世界上的石油，很大一部分是被公路上的汽车吃掉的。联邦德国ＢＭＷ汽车厂研究从太阳能提取氢气作动力的设想固然很好，但这不是短时间可以普遍推广的。就目前条件说，省油还是最实际的办法。据一项调查，在　西方市场上，仍然有６２％的人希望买省油车。
    汽车省油一靠内部发动机的改造，二靠外壳流线型的改善。在汽车展览中，人们首先看到的是外表“怪里怪气”的车型。所有的制造商都力图在空气动力学、工艺美术学、设计工程上获得新成果，因为这是达到减少阻力、节省用油的主要途径。雷诺汽车厂设计的“梅斯塔”四座位小车，耗油量低，这首先归功于它的近乎整体成型的流线型设计。行家们认为，省油车不但在发达国家拥有市场，在世界其它地区也会拥有市场，它在未来的汽车工业发展中必将占有重要的地位。
    　　　　金属材料减少
    就汽车使用的材料来说，减少金属成分是一个需要不断解决的课题。公元２０００年还不可能制成“全塑料车”，但现在已设计的个别新型车的非金属代用件已达到３０％，和金属比较，塑料等成分具有容易成型、价格便宜、重量轻等优点。目前每辆汽车平均只有６０公斤非金属件，占全重的８％，成本费的１０％，这说明汽车材料的革新大有作为。随着化工业等的发展，公元２０００年汽车的材料组成必将更加多样、合理。
    　　　　提高安全系数
    近些年来，全世界每年死于车祸的人数高达约４０万人，居各种事故伤亡人数的首位。鉴于汽车数量不断增加，而公路设施和管理存在的问题短时期又难以解决，因此对未来汽车工业的要求，莫过于提高安全系数。据一项改进汽车性能的民意测验，８０％以上的人要求加强安全措施。近年来，许多汽车制造商都在积极推广四轮导向、四轮传动的新技术，以提高刹车性能，确保在有雪雨的路面上行车的安全。去年，在西欧四轮汽车订单达１８万份。安全的另一个因素就是依靠电子装置。１９８０年装有电子设备的汽车全世界为１５０万辆，１９８４年已增加到８００万辆，未来十年，肯定还会有更大幅度的增加。
    　　　　高级车中档化
    随着汽车性能、质量不断提高，追求高档车的人逐渐多起来了。根据这一市场动向，制造厂商们正在规划一个高级车中档化的蓝图，把一部分为高级豪华汽车服务的设备移植到中档车上。据统计，中档车提高档次后，价格可能提高４０％。但由于有质量保证，用户在维修、保养、耗油方面得到的好处，至少可以补偿２０％的支出。因此，从安全、舒适的角度看，今后将有更多的顾客购买拥有高档设备的中高档汽车。
    　　　　生产世界化
    汽车工业和产品市场的竞争历来十分激烈。经过多年不断的分化、改组、兼并，早已形成了分布西欧、美国、日本的十大汽车集团，目前正朝着一种更加错综复杂的“世界化”发展。一种跨行业、跨企业、跨国家的联合正在世界蔓延。
    由于产品更新周期长、研究费用高昂，联合研制新产品已提到更高地位。法国、西德、瑞典等西欧国家联合研制的“智慧车”就集中了１４家汽车厂、２０００家电器工厂、５０所大学和研究所的力量。
    日本同美国、西欧的竞争进入更高的层次。日本汽车大半外销，已占了美国市场的１／３以上。近年来，乘欧洲统一大市场到来之前，日本抢先在英国、意大利、西班牙、葡萄牙等国设厂，就地生产就地推销。现在日本一年销往西欧的汽车为１３０万辆。
    汽车生产大国正向第三世界扩充市场。法、日已联合到墨西哥办厂。人们认为，迈向２０００年的汽车工业，走的将是一条充满世界性竞争的道路。
