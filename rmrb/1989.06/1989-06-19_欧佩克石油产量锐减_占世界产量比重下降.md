The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) has seen its share of global oil production decline sharply from 50% in 1971 to around 30% in recent years.

According to a report released by the International Energy Agency in Paris on June 18, OPEC's average daily oil production in 1971 was 25.4 million barrels, accounting for about half of the world's total oil production that year. By 1980, this figure had increased to 27.5 million barrels, but its share of the global oil production had dropped to 44%. This downward trend continued, and by 1987, OPEC's share had further decreased to 32%, with an average daily production of 19.6 million barrels. In contrast, the world's total oil production in 1987 averaged 61 million barrels per day.

The report also noted that the peak of global oil production occurred in 1979, with an average daily output of 66 million barrels.

    新华社北京６月１９日电  石油输出国组织（欧佩克）的石油生产在世界石油生产中所占的比重已由１９７１年的５０％锐减至近年来的约３０％左右。
    据设在巴黎的国际能源机构６月１８日发表的一份报告说，欧佩克１９７１年的原油产量平均每天为２５４０万桶，约占当年世界原油总产量的一半，１９８０年为２７５０万桶，在世界石油总产量中所占的比例下降为４４％，并由此每况愈下，到１９８７年锐减至３２％，平均日产量为１９６０万桶，而当年世界石油总产量平均每天达６１００万桶。
    这份报告还说，世界石油生产高峰为１９７９年，平均每天６６００万桶。
