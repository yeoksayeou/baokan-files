	Li Peifu, a young writer from Henan, is not one to speak much, and he seems to get excited rarely. During meetings, he always sits in a corner that doesn't draw attention, quietly listening. His works are much like his personality—subtle yet profound, calm and stern.

	Unexpectedly, it was this very quiet and modest Li Peifu who "shocked the audience" at a recent literary discussion. That day, Li Peifu mainly discussed three points: that writers must have a sense of betrayal in life, that one cannot transcend the process, and that language is thought.

	The phrase "language is thought" sparked a debate that day. However, from the perspective of the relationship between writers and the world and the social symbolic nature of literature, the original intention of this statement should be clear. Style is not just a matter of language, structure, and narrative methods; it is the manifestation of the writer's way of thinking, that is, how you view the world and the results of such a view. If we attribute this to an individual's creative changes, then finding the style is to find your unique understanding of the world.

	From writing about familiar people and trivial matters to contemplating the course of Chinese culture, from focusing on concrete life details to pondering the abstract meanings of life, Li Peifu's works have undergone continuous changes in themes and language forms. This is a reflection of his evolving understanding of the "world" as a writer and his personal growth. For example, before 1984, works like "Letters from a Small Town," "Cricket," and "Young Builders" received positive reviews, but the perspectives, structures, tones, and colors—i.e., the language—fully revealed that the author's thinking was still confined to a concrete understanding of the world. The evaluations of the world in these works lacked sufficient rational depth and abstract elevation. After the transitional work "Forest," works like "Red Grasshoppers, Green Grasshoppers," "The Seventeenth Descendant of the Li Family," "Golden House," and "Red Brick Mat" showcased a completely different realm. These new works, regardless of length, strive to break free from personal experiences and concrete perceptions, offering readers an overall image of human existence and order. They aim to transform the writer's personal life experiences into universal human experiences as fully as possible. This effort not only indicates that Li Peifu has begun to see the world as a whole but also shows that when he says, "language is thought," he actually means "you can only express what you understand."

	The sense of betrayal in life. This was the central point of Li Peifu's speech that day, but it can also be seen as the fundamental driving force behind his current creative work. In contemporary terms, cultivating a sense of betrayal in life is to strengthen the writer's sense of independence and subjectivity, and to enhance the writer's critical spirit towards life. Of course, the most important aspect is the writer's spirit of self-denial. Li Peifu has seen the flesh-and-blood connection between people and the land, between reality and history. He has taken up the tradition of "writing about life," but he has also transcended the simple, pure emotions towards the land. He uses a critical eye to view the land and life, which is his unique strength and the spiritual source of his ability to constantly negate and transcend himself. The most direct example is the novel "The Seventeenth Descendant of the Li Family." This work devotes half of its length to the history of the Li ancestors and the other half to contemporary life. Many people feel that the historical part, whether in terms of ideological content or artistic expression, is stronger than the part about contemporary life. I share this sentiment. However, I have also noticed that the imbalance in the proportion of these two parts is actually a manifestation of the author's internal conflict. On one hand, he emphasizes that "blood is connected," and history cannot be severed; on the other hand, he deeply feels that contemporary Chinese people have lost the toughness, resilience, and firm beliefs of their ancestors. Therefore, in his expression, he unconsciously pours too much love into the Li ancestors, who symbolize the spirit of humanity. But this is just a partial technical error. As a whole, the work focuses on the fate of "humanity," on the history of humanity from yesterday to tomorrow. Therefore, the work should convey at least two messages: one is that reality is a continuation of history. That is, so-called national weaknesses, cultural inertia, etc., come from the cultural process itself and will not disappear overnight. This is a criticism of history. The other is that humans are moving towards tomorrow. Regardless of whether the people of "Dali Village" are willing, the machine sounds representing the will of history will eventually replace Grandma Li's folktales. This is a criticism of reality. These two sentences are what Li Peifu expresses with twenty thousand words about his sense of betrayal in life, and they are the soul he imbues in this work. Without such a critical spirit, a writer loses his meaning, and cannot become a spiritual pillar of human existence and a pioneer of human culture. From writing simple life stories like "Cricket" to writing life experiences like "Red Grasshoppers, Green Grasshoppers," and then to panoramic life paintings like "Descendant" and "Golden House," it not only shows that Li Peifu's vision has broadened but also demonstrates that his sense of betrayal in life has become increasingly self-aware.

	One cannot transcend the process. This is the sentence from Li Peifu's speech that interests me the most. For Li Peifu personally, he entered the literary world by writing about people and things he knew best. His debut work, "Young Builders," from the protagonist to the details, even the name of a street, was all genuine "local color." "Plowed an Extra Furrow" is his real-life experience in the countryside. At that time, he did not know about "symbolism" and did not understand how to experience the "suffering of all humanity" while sitting on a sofa. Therefore, he could only honestly write about what he saw and what he understood. The saying "thirty years ago, an old monk saw a mountain: the mountain is a mountain, the water is water" is an inevitable process constrained by one's experiential intelligence and theoretical cultivation. Starting from "Forest" to the recent "Red Brick Mat," his vision has opened up, and he has seen a completely different order of existence. He has experienced the charm of symbolism, so his works are now full of philosophical reflections on life, with a mix of reality and illusion, truth and fantasy. This is another process, indicating that after fully experiencing life and absorbing the sweet dew of the earth, Li Peifu has begun to search for the rational connotations of culture, history, philosophy, etc., behind life's appearances. If a writer cannot often negate himself and cannot often move from one process to another new process, then the literary life of this writer will inevitably decline. Therefore, Li Peifu must also necessarily transcend the current stage of exploration and move towards new unknown territories. I would like to use his recent work "Golden House" as an example. This work has a flexible structure, charming language, and profound psychological portrayal. It conveys the strong impact of the era on traditional culture and social order from the side. It can be said to be a good work. However, as a long novel, I feel that the author's vision is not broad enough, and the background pushed out is not deep and vast enough. Moreover, this seems not to be a technical error—such as not writing about the city, not directly writing about reforms, etc., but a limitation of the vision itself. Of course, as a reader, I cannot provide any "prescriptions," but I am willing to see Li Peifu find new spiritual realms and literary visions with broader cultural backgrounds beyond "symbolism" and "history."

　　李佩甫和他的小说
    曾凡
    李佩甫，河南青年作家，他不肯多说话，似乎也很少激动。每逢开会，总是坐在不引人注目的角落里静静地听。他的作品也一如其为人，引而不发，宁静峻峭。
    没想到，就是这样一个老实腼腆的李佩甫，居然在前不久的一次作品讨论会上“语惊四座”。那天，李佩甫主要谈了三个观点，一是作家必须有人生的背叛意识，一是人不能超越过程，一是语言即思维。
    语言即思维。这句话那天是引起争论的一个触发点，其实，从作家与世界的关系和文学的社会性符号性这种角度来看，这句话的本意应该是明确的。文体不是一般的语言、结构、叙述方法的问题，而是作家思维方式的呈现，即你从哪个角度看世界和这样看的结果。归之于一个人的创作变化，那么找到了文体就是找到了你个人对于世界的独特理解。
    李佩甫从写身边的熟人琐事到纵观中国文化进程，从关注具象的生活细节到沉思抽象的人生意蕴，其间作品主题和语言形式的不断变化，正是他作为一个作家对“世界”的认识不断升华的表现，也是他作为一个人不断成熟的表现。比如１９８４年以前，他的《小城书柬》、《蛐蛐》、《青年建设者》等作品虽受到舆论好评，但那些作品的视角、结构方式和语调、色彩即语言则充分显示出作者的思维仍停留在对世界的具象感悟之中，那里所展示的作家对世界的评价还缺少足够的理性沉淀和抽象升华。经过《森林》这个过渡带，《红蚂蚱，绿蚂蚱》、《李氏家族的第十七代玄孙》、《金屋》、《红炕席》这些作品则展示了完全不同的境界。这些新作，不拘长短，都力图跳出个人经验和具象感悟的限制，而向读者提供一种理解人和人的生存秩序的整体图象，力图使作家个人的人生体验最充分地转化为普遍的人生体验。这种努力不仅表明李佩甫开始把世界理解为一个整体，而且也表明，当他说：“语言即思维”的时候，他实际想告诉我们的是“你只能说出你所理解的”。
    人生的背叛意识。这是李佩甫那天发言的中心，但也不妨看成是他现阶段创作的基本精神动力。用现在比较流行的话来说，树立人生的背叛意识，也就是要强化作家的独立意识、主体意识，强化作家对人生的批判精神。当然，还有最重要的一条：作家的自我否定精神。李佩甫看到了人与大地、现实与历史的血肉联系，接过了“写生活”的传统，但又超越了对土地的质朴情感，用批判的眼光看待土地和人生，这正是他的过人之处，也是他能不断否定自己超越自己的精神之源。最直接的例子是《李氏家族第十七代玄孙》这部长篇。这部作品用一半的篇幅写李氏先祖的历史，一半的篇幅写当代人生世相。许多人感觉，写历史的部分无论思想内涵还是艺术表达都强于写现实的部分。我也有同感。但我也注意到，这两部分的比例失调其实也是作者自己内心矛盾的一种呈示。一方面，他强调“血脉是联着的”，历史无法割断；一方面他又痛感当代中国人已经失去了祖先的强悍坚韧和坚定的人生信念，因此在表达中不自觉地把过多的爱倾注给了象征着人的精神的李氏先祖们。不过这只是一种局部的技术性失误而已。作为整体，这部作品所关注的其实是“人类”的命运，是从昨天走来向明天走去的人类历史。所以，作品告诉我们的至少应该有两句话：一是现实是历史的继续。即所谓民族劣根性、文化惰性等等来自文化过程本身，不会在一天里断然消失。这是对历史的批判。一是人是向着明天的，不管“大李村”人是否愿意，代表历史意志的机器声终会取代七奶奶的瞎话儿。这是对现实的批判。这两句话就是李佩甫用二十万言表达的他对人生的背叛意识，就是他赋予这部作品的灵魂。没有这样的批判精神，作家就失去了存在意义，就不能作为人类生存的精神支柱成为人类文化的开拓者。从写《蛐蛐》那样质朴的生活故事到写《红蚂蚱，绿蚂蚱》那种生命体验，再到《玄孙》和《金屋》这种全景式的人生画卷，不仅表明李佩甫视野开阔了，更显示出他对人生的背叛意识愈益自觉了。
    人不能超越过程。这是李佩甫那次发言里最令我感兴趣的一句话。就李佩甫个人来说，他是从“写自己最熟悉的人和事”步入文坛的。他的处女作《青年建设者》从主人公到细节甚至一条街道的名称都是实实在在的“本色”。《多犁了一沟田》是他在农村的真实生活经验。这时他还不知道“象征”，还不懂得坐在沙发里体验“全人类的苦难”。所以他只能老老实实见到什么写什么，认识什么写什么。所谓三十年前老僧看山“山是山，水是水”，这是人的经验智力和理论素养所制约着的无可逾越的过程。从《森林》开始直到最近的《红炕席》，他的视界打开了，见到了和以往完全不同的生存秩序，体会到了象征的魅力，因此作品虚虚实实亦真亦幻充满了对人生的哲理思考，是所谓“见山不是山，见水不是水”的光景儿了。这也是一个过程，这表明李佩甫在充分体验了人生吮吸了大地的甘露之后，开始搜寻生活表象之后的文化、历史、哲学等等理性内涵了。一个作家如果不能经常地否定自己不能经常地从一个过程走向另一个新的过程，那么这个作家的文学生命必然也就衰亡了。所以，李佩甫必然也必须超越现阶段的探索，走向新的未知里程。我想以他的新作《金屋》为例。这部作品结构自如，语言有魅力，心理刻画洞幽烛微，从侧面传达出时代对传统文化冲心的强序会态和社秩大击，可以说是部好作品。但作为一部长篇小说，我觉得作者的视野似乎还不够开阔，推出的背景不够幽深宏大，而且，这似乎不是技术性失误——比如没有写城市、没有正面写改革之类，而是视界本身的限制造成的。当然，作为读者我不能提供任何“药方”，但我却愿意看到李佩甫在“象征”和“历史”之外能够找到新的具有更广阔文化背景的精神境界和文学视界。
    我想，这就是我借助于李佩甫的几句话和他的作品所认识的作家李佩甫。未知是也不是？
