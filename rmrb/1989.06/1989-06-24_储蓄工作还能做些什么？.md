Recently, a Japanese friend suggested that China should treat increasing national savings as a major national policy. He said that 40 years ago, Japan's economy also faced a situation of significant price increases and enterprises urgently needing loans. After the Japanese government decided to launch a national savings campaign, many people went deep into urban and rural areas to extensively promote savings and expand services, and the situation quickly improved. In 14 years, private savings rose from 700 billion yen to 8000 billion yen. Today, Japan's national savings have reached several trillion yen, and funds are in surplus, yet the national savings campaign remains a global focus.

The friend's remarks are not some major news, but he indeed raises an important question for us: What more can we do for our savings work? If we ponder this question thoroughly, perhaps our national savings will see a new situation.

Currently, our country mainly expands savings by raising deposit interest rates, and some places also use methods like lotteries and prize draws. However, many people have observed that after a period of enthusiasm in some places, the bank's business still does not show much change: many savings offices still operate on a rigid schedule, and factory and office workers find the doors locked after work; there are no good strategies for children and students' savings, with no breakthrough progress; flexible and diverse deposit and withdrawal services like multi-branch access and credit cards have not been widely promoted; the savings campaign's propaganda cannot be sustained and universally carried out in urban and rural areas. According to a sample survey, most people holding cash are willing to deposit their money in banks. However, why is there still over 150 billion yuan of cash in the hands of the people? There are certainly many reasons for this, but the problems within the savings work itself are worth studying.

Some economic experts say that increasing savings is not just a measure but should become a national policy for our country. This is a profound insight. For such a large country as ours, construction funds mainly rely on internal accumulation, relying on the hard work and thrift of the entire nation, and using savings to put all the money that can be saved into national construction. Only with this understanding can we reflect the position of savings work in the development of the national economy, and only then can the financial sector treat it as a fundamental task, and various levels of government and departments treat it as an important task. The financial sector should ensure the rights of depositors, increase service items, improve service attitudes, enhance bank credibility, adjust business hours, and create a good savings environment. The author has received several letters from the public, and their common opinion on savings work is: deposits and withdrawals are inconvenient, business is not flexible and diverse enough, and the service attitude is rigid. The problems they reflect are not complex, but they all involve the fundamental construction of savings work. The financial sector should focus more on this fundamental construction, which will not only bring convenience, trust, security, and economic benefits to depositors but also bring new hope to our country's financial industry.

Expanding savings cannot rely on administrative orders but requires extensive propaganda to arouse people's savings enthusiasm. Bank and savings office staff should frequently go to the public to promote and carry out savings work, and relevant departments should closely cooperate.

Increasing savings promotes economic growth, economic growth brings an increase in national income, and an increase in national income further promotes savings. All of this helps to establish a thrift-conscious society. We hope to see this virtuous cycle as soon as possible.

### 储蓄工作还能做些什么？

　　储蓄工作还能做些什么？
    路华
    前些时候，一位日本友好人士提出建议，中国要把增加国民储蓄作为国家重大方针对待。他说４０年前日本经济也出现过物价大幅度上涨、企业急需贷款的困境。在日本政府决定开展国民储蓄运动以后，许多人深入城乡广泛宣传储蓄，扩展业务，结果局面迅速改观。１４年中民间储蓄由７万亿日元上升到８０万亿日元。而今，日本国民储蓄已达到数百万亿日元，资金出现过剩，可国民储蓄运动依然举世瞩目。
    这位友好人士所述并非什么大新闻，但他确实给我们提出一个重要问题：我们的储蓄工作还能做些什么？如果把这个问题琢磨透，也许我国的群众储蓄会出现新局面。
    目前，我国扩大储蓄主要采取提高存款利率，有些地方也搞些抽奖、摸奖等招数。但是，许多人看到不少地方在一阵热劲过去以后，银行的业务仍然没有多大变化：许多储蓄所营业的时间还是机关化，工厂、机关的职工下班后去储蓄，看到的是紧锁的大门；儿童、学生的储蓄也拿不出良策，没有突破性进展；一处开户多处取用和信用卡等灵活多样的储取业务还没有大面积推广；储蓄运动的宣传也不能持之以恒地在城乡普遍开展。据抽样调查，现在手持现金的大部分群众是愿意把钱存入银行的。但是，为什么还有１５００亿元以上的现金在群众手里呢？这里原因固然较多，但储蓄工作本身的问题很值得研究。
    有些经济专家说，增加储蓄不仅是对策，而且应成为我国的国策。这是卓识之见。我们这样大的国家，建设资金主要靠内部积累，靠全国人民勤劳节俭，把一切能够节省下来的钱通过储蓄用到国家建设上。只有这样认识，才能反映储蓄工作在国民经济发展中的地位，金融部门才能把它当作基础工作来抓，各级政府和各个部门才能把它作为重要的工作去做。金融部门要保障储户权益，增加服务项目，改进服务态度，提高银行信誉，调整营业时间，创造良好的储蓄环境。笔者收到好几封群众来信，他们对储蓄工作的共同意见是：存取不便，业务不够灵活多样，服务态度生硬。他们反映的问题并不复杂，但都涉及储蓄工作基础建设问题。金融部门应在这个基础建设上多下功夫，这不独会带给储户方便、信任感、安全感和经济利益，也会给我国的金融事业带来新的希望。
    扩大储蓄不能指望行政命令，要靠广泛的宣传，以唤起人们的储蓄热情。银行、储蓄所的职工要经常到群众中去宣传和开展储蓄工作，各有关部门要密切配合。
    储蓄增长促进经济增长，经济增长带来国民收入的增加，国民收入增加又促进储蓄进一步增多。这一切，又有助于社会勤俭之风的树立。我们希望早日看到这种良性循环。
