　　波兰大选第２轮选举揭晓    
    执政的联盟派在议会中占６５％
    新华社华沙６月２０日电  据波兰全国选举委员会今天公布的波兰大选第２轮选举结果，２９４名执政的联盟派候选人和１名反对派候选人当选为第１０届波兰议会议员；７名反对派候选人和１名无党派人士当选为新设立的参议院议员。
    第２轮选举是６月１８日进行的。按照波兰宪法规定，波兰议会大选必须选出４６０名议员和１００名参议员，以组成新的议会和参议院。然而，６月４日举行的第１轮选举仅选出１６５名议员和９２名参议员。大多数候选人因未能获得半数以上的有效票而落选。根据选举法，尚有２９５名议员和８名参议员须在第２轮选举中产生。
    参加第２轮选举的共有１６名参议员候选人和５８５名议员候选人，其中包括５３５名在第１轮选举中得票未超过半数的候选人和６６名由联盟派新提出的候选人。
    从两轮选举结果看来，以波兰统一工人党为首的联盟派在议会中占６５％，拥有２９９个席位，以团结工会为核心的反对派占３５％，拥有１６１个席位。参议院选举结果是，联盟派未获１席，反对派赢得１００个席位中的９９个，剩下１席被无党派人士、私人企业家夺走。
    据悉，不久将举行的议会和参议院联席会议——国民大会，将选出共和国总统。
