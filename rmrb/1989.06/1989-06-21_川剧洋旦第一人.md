In the cold winter, the Beijing Jixiang Theater was filled with warmth: the Chongqing Sichuan Opera Theater was performing a series of excerpts that warmed the hearts of both Chinese and foreign audiences. As the final excerpt, "Departing for the Northern Frontier," was about to begin, the subtitle displayed the name of the actress playing Wang Zhaojun as "Susan Petrel," with her Chinese name "Pei Jingyuan." Before the audience could react, the high-pitched Ma Men melody "Hanling clouds are horizontal, the north wind blows through the purple silk robe" resonated like a clap of thunder. The tall Wang Zhaojun hurried onto the stage, her steps graceful and her movements well-practiced. However, her deep-set eyes and high nose bridge eventually revealed her Caucasian features. The theater fell silent. After singing "Chujiang Yin," the excited audience burst into applause.

If Wei Lisha was the first Westerner to perform Chinese opera (Beijing Opera), then Susan was the first Westerner to perform Chinese local opera.

Susan is a PhD student in the drama department of the University of Hawaii. She originally studied Chinese and in 1984 participated in the school's performance of the Beijing Opera "Phoenix Returns to the Nest" directed by Wei Lisha, which toured in the United States. Susan played the role of a clown. In 1986, she also toured with the troupe to perform in China. From then on, she developed a deep interest in Chinese opera. In 1987, she went to Sichuan and studied at the Sichuan Opera School and Sichuan Opera Research Institute. In March 1988, she became a disciple of Liu Shiyu, a teacher at the Sichuan Opera School, and focused on learning the high-pitched style. In just a few months, she mastered three excerpts, "Departing for the Northern Frontier," "Beating the Gods," and "Worshipping the Moon Twice," as well as some singing segments. Sichuan Opera is not easy to learn; even people from outside Sichuan find it difficult to grasp. Susan faced even greater challenges, especially with the echoing dialogue. However, she overcame the language barrier, and even a Sichuan Opera enthusiast like myself found her performance quite authentic.

Susan believes that many English resources about Chinese opera abroad are full of errors. She wants to seriously study Chinese opera, especially Sichuan Opera, and introduce it to Western audiences and readers. If possible, she would like to invite Sichuan Opera artists to perform in the United States. General Zhang Aiping highly praised her spirit and gave her the Chinese name "Zhong Meiyu." General Zhang explained: first, she fell in love with Sichuan Opera at first sight; second, the name "Zhong" is a homophone for "China," symbolizing a beautiful jade that combines China and America; third, it includes the name of her teacher, Liu Shiyu.

Incidentally, "Pei Jingyuan" was the Chinese name she took before coming to China.

　　川剧洋旦第一人
    罗辛
    隆冬时节，北京吉祥戏院里春意融融：重庆川剧院演出的折子戏温暖着济济一堂的中外观众。最后一折《出北塞》即将开演，字幕上打出王昭君扮演者“苏珊·佩特尔”，中文名字“裴静媛”，观众还没明白怎么回事，高亢的马门腔“汉岭云横，朔风吹透紫罗衣”仿若一声春雷。高挑个儿的王昭君急步上场，台步娴熟，身段训练有素。然而深眼窝，高鼻梁，终于露出了白种人的本相。剧场里鸦雀无声。一曲“楚江吟”歌罢，兴奋的观众连声喝采。
    如果说魏莉莎是第一个登台演唱中国戏曲（京剧）的白种人，那末，苏珊就是第一个登台演唱中国地方戏的白种人。
    苏珊是美国夏威夷大学戏剧系的博士研究生，原学中文，１９８４年曾参加该校魏莉莎排演的京剧《凤还巢》，在美国公演。苏珊在戏中饰丑旦。１９８６年还曾随团到中国演出。从那时起，她便对中国戏曲产生了浓厚的兴趣。１９８７年赴四川，在省川剧学校和川剧研究院学习。１９８８年３月，拜川剧学校教师刘世玉为师，重点学高腔。短短几个月，她便学会了《出北塞》、《打神》、《双拜月》三个折子戏以及一些片断唱腔。川剧不好学，别说外国人，四川以外的中国人也感到难以把握。苏珊更是如此，最难的是道白的回声。但她毕竟克服了语言障碍，就连笔者这样在四川土生土长的川剧迷，都觉得她唱得很够味儿。
    苏珊认为，国外关于中国戏曲的英文资料许多错误百出。她要认真学习中国戏曲，特别是川剧，并把它介绍给西方观众读者，可能时，还请川剧艺术家到美国演出。张爱萍将军十分称赞她的这种精神，给她起了个中文名字“钟美玉”。张老解释说：一是她对川剧一见钟情；二是取“钟”与“中”之谐音，犹言中美结合的一块美玉；三，取其教师刘世玉名字中的一个字。
    顺便告诉读者，“裴静媛”是她来中国之前取的中文名字。
