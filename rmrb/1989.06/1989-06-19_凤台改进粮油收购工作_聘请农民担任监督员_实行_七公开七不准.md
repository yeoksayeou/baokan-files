Fengtai Improves Grain and Oil Procurement Work
Hires Farmers as Supervisors
Implements "Seven Opens and Seven No's"

New China News Agency, Hefei, June 19 — (Correspondent Wang Xiaomei) To increase the transparency of grain and oil procurement work, overcome negative phenomena in procurement, and ensure the timely, quality, and quantity completion of summer grain and oil procurement tasks, Fengtai County in Anhui Province has hired two to three farmers known for their fairness and policy knowledge in each township's procurement point as supervisors this year. The county has implemented the "Seven Opens and Seven No's" to allow farmers to sell their grain and oil with confidence.

The "Seven Opens and Seven No's" are as follows: Open the amount of grain pre-purchase deposits, do not allow deductions at each level; open the quantity of grain and oil procurement tasks, do not allow additional quotas at each level; open the grain and oil bonus and sales materials, do not allow retention at each level; open the grain and oil procurement prices, implement quality-based pricing, do not favor relatives and friends, or accept grain as gifts; open the grain and oil procurement standards, do not suppress grades and prices, or raise grades and prices; open the grain and oil settlement methods, insist on the principle of "who sells the grain, who gets the money," except for agricultural taxes, do not deduct grain funds for any unit or individual; open the procurement discipline, mobilize the masses to supervise, set up suggestion boxes, do not retaliate against those who report issues.

The county's grain and oil food bureau has also decided: To improve the service attitude and quality, all procurement personnel must wear identification tags and consciously accept supervision.

　　凤台改进粮油收购工作
    聘请农民担任监督员
    实行“七公开七不准”
    新华社合肥６月１９日电  （通讯员王晓梅）安徽省凤台县为了提高粮油收购工作的透明度，克服收购中的不良现象，确保夏季粮油收购按时、按质、按量完成任务，今年在全县各乡收购点都聘请了二至三名办事公道、懂政策的农民担任监督员，实行“七公开、七不准”，让广大农民放心出售粮油。
    这“七公开、七不准”是：公开粮食预购定金数额，不准层层克扣；公开粮油定购任务数量，不准层层加码；公开粮油奖售物资，不准层层截留；公开粮油收购价格，实行优质优价，劣质劣价，不准优亲厚友，收人情粮；公开粮油收购标准，不准压级压价，抬级抬价；公开粮油结算办法，坚持谁卖粮谁得款，除农业税外，不准为任何单位或个人代扣粮款；公开收购纪律，发动群众监督，设立举报箱，不准打击报复。
    这个县粮油食品局还做出决定：为切实改善服务态度，提高服务质量，所有收购人员一律挂牌亮号，自觉接受监督。
