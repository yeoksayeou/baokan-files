Title: The Trend of "Enhancing and Adding Splendor" Should Not Be Allowed to Continue

The author previously published an article titled "Why Change the Old Appearance?" which Mr. Dou Zonglin from Fuxian County found "unpleasant to hear." This genuinely puzzled me: the author was not specifically targeting any particular unit or any specific ancient building restoration project, but rather was expressing feelings about the problem of "protective destruction" that currently exists in the work of restoring cultural relics. Since Mr. Dou's article wants to attribute everything to Famen Temple, let's see how Famen Temple is "enhancing and adding splendor" to the ancient site!

Firstly, Mr. Dou's article acknowledges that for cultural relics, we should "adopt the policy of active protection and development and utilization," and "ensure the original appearance," but it also proposes that we should "enhance and add splendor" to the ancient sites. Isn't this self-contradictory? If "enhancing and adding splendor" means actively doing a good job in cultural relic protection work, making the ancient relics shine with the glorious light of historical culture, this is commendable and should be strongly advocated. However, Mr. Dou's article obviously does not mean this. An ancient building reflects the scientific and technological level of its time, the social, cultural, and living conditions of its time, and showcases the architectural style of a certain dynasty. Therefore, it has historical, artistic, and scientific value. The "Cultural Relics Protection Law" clearly stipulates that when "repairing, maintaining, or relocating" ancient buildings, one must follow the principle of not changing the original state of the relics. In 1963, Professor Liang Sicheng proposed that the repair of ancient buildings should be "restored to their original state." Protection and destruction seem to be unrelated, but if one does not follow the above principles, thinking that the older the building, the better, and the more splendid, the better, blindly pursuing "enhancing and adding splendor," the cultural value of the ancient site will depreciate and even be lost, turning protection into destruction. This is absolutely not an attitude of respecting history and cultural science. Fuxian County plans to demolish the well-preserved Ming and Qing dynasty Buddhist halls and expand them into grand Tang-style buildings. Can this "enhancing and adding splendor" be considered "ensuring the original appearance"? Fortunately, this plan has not been implemented. Moreover, Mr. Dou's article mixes the construction of Famen Temple with the development of the Terracotta Army, which is utterly wrong. The former is destruction, while the latter is the excavation and restoration of the original appearance based on historical evidence; the two cannot be compared. As for the issue of Loulan Ancient City mentioned by Mr. Dou, I believe there are many ways to protect it, such as building protective forest belts and changing the macroclimate around the ancient city to prevent it from being eroded by wind and sand, etc. It achieves the goal of not being submerged without "changing the old appearance to a new one" and rebuilding a new city, which is the correct method of protection.

Secondly, regarding the restoration of the Famen Temple Pagoda. I did not mention the restoration of the pagoda in the previous article, but I was worried that the existing Buddhist halls would be demolished and rebuilt. Mr. Dou's article remains silent on the demolition of the halls but writes about the restoration of the pagoda and the excavation of the underground palace. Mr. Dou acknowledges that the development and utilization of cultural relics "is to carry out necessary restoration," but if regular maintenance and reinforcement of the pagoda could be done, why wait until it collapses before taking remedial measures? This has been done many times by our people, not just in the field of cultural relics. The pagoda collapsed half in 1981, with many materials and photographs available for restoration, and the building materials can also be reused. If it is restored to its original state, it will not lose its cultural value. I once consulted a famous expert in ancient architecture, who said that only by maintaining the original form, the original architectural style, layout, structure, materials, and construction techniques, can the restoration be the original meaning of the ancient site. Modern materials and technologies are not prohibited from being used, but the purpose is to reinforce the original materials so that they can be preserved for a longer time, not to replace them, and to achieve concealment and harmony. However, it is said that the local authorities once wanted to turn the Ming dynasty pagoda into a Tang dynasty pagoda. If the current construction is a Tang dynasty pagoda, where does the scientific basis come from? If it is a Ming dynasty pagoda, does the reinforced concrete structure maintain the original eaves and carved brackets? Has it achieved the several "maintains"? According to Mr. Dou's article, the current height of the pagoda is 47 meters, while the original height was 45 meters (see "Dictionary of Famous Chinese Scenic Spots"). Suddenly, it has increased by 2 meters. Can this be considered "completely maintaining the original appearance and architectural style"? "Enhancing and adding splendor" to the ancient pagoda is making a fake antique!

Thirdly, protecting cultural relics and developing tourism are not contradictory, but the relationship between the two must be handled properly. The development of China's tourism industry cannot do without scenic spots and cultural relics. Foreign tourists come to see China's long history and ancient culture. If precious ancient sites are turned into worthless fake antiques one after another, why would they travel thousands of miles to China? It would be more convenient to build some Chinese fake antiques at home and spend money there? Doesn't America already have "Mingxuan"? Building hotels and other service facilities should also pay attention to protecting the original environment and appearance of ancient buildings, and avoid mixing the old with the new or letting the guest overshadow the host. In short, "enhancing and adding splendor" and "restoring the old to its original state" have essential differences. If this trend of "enhancing and adding splendor" continues, it will bring serious consequences to the protection of cultural relics, which cannot be ignored!

### “增色添辉”风不可长

　　“增色添辉”风不可长
    郑凯歌
    笔者曾发表一篇《旧貌何须变新颜》的文章，扶风县窦宗林同志对此颇感“逆耳”，这着实让我不解：笔者并非具体针对某个单位、某项古建筑修复工程，而是出于对目前在文物古迹修复工作中存在的“保护性破坏”问题的有感之作。既然窦文要全揽到法门寺头上，那么，且看法门寺是怎样“让古迹增色添辉”的吧！
    其一，窦文承认对文物古迹要“采取积极保护和开发利用的方针”，“确保原貌”，却又提出“应当让古迹增色添辉”，岂不自相矛盾？如果说“增色添辉”是指积极做好文保工作，使古老的文物焕发出历史文化的绚丽光彩，这是无可指责且大力倡褒的，但窦文显然指的不是这。一座古建筑，它反映了当时的科学技术水平，当时的社会、文化与生活状况，展示了某一朝代的建筑风格，所以才具有历史、艺术和科学价值。“文物保护法”中明确规定，古建筑“在进行修缮、保养、迁移的时候必须遵守不改变文物原状的原则”。１９６３年梁思成教授提出维修古建筑应“整旧如旧”。保护与破坏似乎是风马牛不相及，但如不按以上原则办事，认为古建筑愈新愈好，愈辉煌愈好，一味追求“增色添辉”，古迹的文物价值就会贬值乃至丧失殆尽，保护即变成破坏。这绝非是尊重历史、尊重文化科学的态度。扶风县拟把尚好的明清佛殿拆掉扩建为规模宏大的仿唐建筑，这种“增色添辉”算得上“确保原貌”吗？幸而这一计划还未实施。另外，窦文把法门寺的建设同秦兵马俑的开发混为一谈，实谬矣。前者属于破坏，后者是有历史依据的发掘、恢复原貌，二者不能同日而语。至于窦文提到的楼兰古城问题，我以为保护的方式也很多，如营造防护林带，改变古城周围的大气候，使之免遭风沙侵蚀，等等。既做到使其不被淹没，又非“旧貌变新颜”重起新城，这才是正确的保护方法。
    其二，关于法门寺宝塔的修复。我上文并未谈及塔的修复，只是忧虑尚存的佛殿将被拆毁重建。窦文对拆殿保持缄默，反在修塔及发掘地宫上作文章。窦文承认对文物古迹开发利用“就是要进行必要的修复”，倘平时能搞好塔的修缮加固，何至于倒塌？等无可挽回了再来补救，这事国人干得多了，岂止是文物方面。塔在１９８１年倒塌一半，有很多资料、照片做修复依据，建材也可利用，如按原状修复也不失其文物。我曾请教过一位著名古建筑专家，他讲只有保持原来的形质，保持原来的建筑风格、形式与布局，保持原来的结构、材料与施工工艺，修复后才能是原来意义上的古迹。现代材料和技术不是不能应用，目的是为了加固原来的材料，使其能更多地得到保存，而不是去更换，并做到隐蔽与和谐。然而，据说当地曾想把明代的塔修成唐朝的塔，若现建的是唐塔，科学依据从何而来？若是明塔，钢筋水泥结构是否保持了原来雕檐刻拱的风貌？是否做到了几个保持？据窦文说现在塔高４７米，而原塔高则是４５米（见《中国名胜词典》），陡然间增长了２米，这能是“完全保持了原有的形象和建筑风格”了吗？“古塔增色添辉”就是造假古董呀！
    其三，保护文物与发展旅游并不相悖，但也须处理好二者的关系。我国旅游事业的发展离不开风景名胜与文物古迹，外国游人看的是中国的悠久历史与古老文化，如果珍贵的古迹相继变成不值钱的假古董，他们何必万里迢迢来到中国，花些钱在本国造些中国的假古董岂不方便？美国不是已有“明轩”了吗？建宾馆等服务设施也要注意保护古建筑原有的环境风貌，切忌古新混杂或喧宾夺主。总之，“增色添辉”与“整旧如旧”有着本质区别，长此“增色添辉”下去，将给文物保护带来严重后果，不可不察！
