　　世界杯足球预赛
    日本队胜朝鲜队
    新华社东京６月４日电  （记者姜占国）世界杯足球赛亚洲区第六组日本队与朝鲜队的首场比赛今天在东京举行，日本队以２∶１获胜。
    比赛是在下午开始的。尽管天气炎热，但双方均是全攻全守型打法，在９０分钟比赛中一直是处于激烈的对抗中。比赛进行到下半场第２６分钟后达到高潮。朝鲜队在一次进攻中，该队９号队员在对方门前看准队友横传过来的球，头顶破门。
    日本队先失一球后全力反击。３分钟后，该队主力、２９岁老将水沼攻破对方大门，把比分扳平。
    在终场前３分钟，日本队打快攻。在朝鲜队门前，一名朝鲜队队员看到形势危急，跳起顶球想把球传给守门员，然而，这时守门员已离开球门，结果把球顶入自己大门。
    到目前为止，日本队和朝鲜队都赛过三场。日本队是１胜２平，朝鲜队是１胜１平１负。
