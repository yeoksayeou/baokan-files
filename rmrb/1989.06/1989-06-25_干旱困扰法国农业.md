A severe drought is ravaging the land of France, with high temperatures and lack of rain becoming a disaster for French agriculture.

Since last autumn, the southwestern region of France has not seen any rain, with some farmlands cracking from dryness. In the past two months, France has seen barely any rain, and agricultural workers across the country are exclaiming, "It's a drought!" Efforts to combat the drought and mitigate the damage are underway, but it is already too late for the winter crops. It is estimated that there may be a loss of "two thousand kilograms of grain per hectare."

Farmers had hoped for 500,000 hectares of spring-planted corn, which, under normal weather conditions, could bring in approximately 10 billion francs in foreign exchange each year. However, the unusually hot weather over the past two months has been disappointing. Farmers are disheartened, saying, "If it doesn't rain in the next two weeks, the losses will be significant." Currently, the sun continues to shine brightly.

　　干旱困扰法国农业
    本报巴黎６月２２日电  据此间报道：严重的干旱正在法兰西土地上肆虐，高热、缺雨已成为法国农业的一场灾难。
    自去秋以来，法国西南部地区一直未下雨，有的农田干裂，近两个月，法国也下几滴雨，各地农业工作者无不惊呼“旱了！”人们虽着手抗旱救灾，但对于冬季谷物已经晚了。人们估计可能“每公顷损失两千公斤谷物”。
    农民们本来寄望于５０万公顷的春播玉米，因在正常气候条件下，每年约可赚汇１００亿法郎。但两个月来比以往高热气候令人失望。农民们沮丧地说，“两星期内再不下雨损失可就大了”。现在，仍是炎阳当空。
