Indulgent in Drinking and Women, Unrepentant

Cuban Transport Minister Dismissed

According to a report by the *Granma* newspaper, the official organ of the Cuban Communist Party Central Committee, on June 13th, the vice chairman of the Cuban Council of Ministers and Minister of Transport, Diocles Torralba, has been relieved of his duties due to issues with his personal conduct.

The report states that Torralba served as the Minister of Sugar in 1980 and later became the Minister of Transport in 1985. During his tenure, he was known for his decadent lifestyle, indulging in drinking and women. He received multiple warnings from the Party Central Committee, but he remained unrepentant and refused to change his ways. Therefore, the Cuban Council of State, upon the recommendation of the Cuban Communist Party Central Political Bureau, decided to remove Torralba from his positions and appointed General Senén Casas to temporarily act as the Minister of Transport.

　　贪杯好色　不肯改悔
    古巴运输部长被罢官
    新华社哈瓦那６月１３日电  据古巴共产党中央机关报《格拉玛报》１３日报道，古巴部长会议执委会副主席兼运输部长迪奥克莱斯·托拉尔瓦因生活作风问题被解除职务。
    报道说，托拉尔瓦１９８０年担任古巴糖业部长，１９８５年以后又改任运输部长。他在任期间因生活腐化，贪杯好色。曾受到过党中央的多次警告，但他仍执迷不悟，不肯改悔。因此，古巴国务委员会根据古巴共产党中央政治局的建议，决定撤销托拉尔瓦所担任的职务，并任命塞嫩·卡萨斯将军暂时代理运输部长一职。
