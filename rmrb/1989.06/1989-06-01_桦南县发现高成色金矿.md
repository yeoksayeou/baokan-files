Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, June 1st.

A high-grade ancient gold mine with significant mining value has been discovered in Huinan County, Heilongjiang Province, by Chinese researchers. This discovery challenges the domestic geological theory that "there are no placer gold mines in the Tertiary period under basalt cover," opening up new avenues for gold exploration.

Over the past four years, a research team consisting of Li Peijie, an engineer from Huinan County Gold Company, and Wang Xianfa, a senior engineer from the county's Science and Technology Commission, along with three other members, has drilled four deep vertical shafts through the basalt and Tertiary rock layers in the areas of Mengjiagang Township and Shitouhezi Township. They have successfully located the ore deposit.

　　桦南县发现高成色金矿
    新华社哈尔滨６月１日电  （通讯员周延河、记者王来喜）我国科研人员在黑龙江桦南县找到具有较高开采价值的古金矿，突破了国内地质界认为“玄武岩掩盖下第三纪没有砂金矿”的理论，开辟了寻找金矿的新领域。
    由桦南县黄金公司工程师李佩杰和县科委高级工程师王显发等五人组成的课题组，最近四年里先后在桦南县孟家岗乡和石头河子镇区域内打了四口穿透玄武岩第三纪岩层的大竖井，找到了矿床。
