Entrepreneurship Knows No End
— A Record of the Director of Weifang Tire Factory, Yu Panlong

Thirteen years ago, on the shores of Yangjiao Bay in Weifang, Shandong, there was a desolate beach. Today, a modern enterprise stands here—Weifang Tire Factory.

The director, Yu Panlong, is often referred to as "a complete set." With his entrepreneurial spirit, he has made this factory produce 740,000 sets of tires annually, with a production value exceeding 100 million yuan, making it one of the top three A-level tire enterprises in the country and a major foreign exchange earner for Weifang.

In the spring of 1976, Yu Panlong was transferred from Weifang Rubber Factory to establish the tire factory. The total capital, including loans and subsidies, was only 29.6 million yuan. Building a factory of this scale was no easy task!

The 150-ton extruder was a key piece of equipment. Unable to purchase it, Yu Panlong decided to make it himself. During the hottest days of summer, he carried heavy parts, traveling to Yantai, Haiyang, and Yizhou County. On the day the machine was finally installed and brought back to Weifang, he collapsed in the workshop from exhaustion and fainted...

On April 28, 1978, the first tire was produced, and Yu Panlong shed tears of joy.

To help Chinese tires reach the world stage, Yu Panlong has always been driven by a strong determination.

In 1980, when the national tire industry was in a slump, Weifang Tire Factory's production of Sanjiao-brand cart, tractor, and automobile tires was also facing a large backlog, teetering on the brink of closure. Yu Panlong noticed that many farmers had bought 12-horsepower tractors but couldn't find matching tires. Seizing this opportunity, he immediately organized production. That year, the factory paid 80 million yuan in taxes and profits, becoming one of the designated tire production factories in the country.

With the modernization of equipment, the introduction of production lines, and the strengthening of technical forces, Yu Panlong planned for the future: producing large engineering tires.

To secure the project, Yu Panlong started lobbying relevant departments in 1984, persistently for over 40 months. His efforts paid off in 1988 when the project was finally approved. The production of large engineering tires has initially changed the long-term reliance on imports.

The "△" brand tires produced by Weifang Tire Factory have developed into 80 different specifications and are sold in 27 provinces and municipalities across the country. They are also exported to nearly 20 countries and regions in Southeast Asia, Eastern Europe, and Western Europe. Mr. Lala Li, a Pakistani businessman, said: The "△" brand tires produced by this factory are not inferior to the famous Japanese brand "BS."

Recently, the 53-year-old Yu Panlong shared his entrepreneurial vision with the reporter: Our factory has included steel cord fabric, full-steel radial truck tires, and semi-steel passenger car tires in our enterprise plan. Production of tubeless tires began in May, and Santana tires will be launched in the third quarter of this year...

　　创业未有穷期    
    ——记山东省威海轮胎厂厂长于泮龙
    本报记者  宋学春
    １３年前，山东威海，羊角湾畔，是一片满目荒凉的海滩。
    如今，这里出现了一座现代化企业——威海轮胎厂。
    厂长于泮龙，人们称其为“一条龙”。他凭着一种创业精神，使这家企业年产轮胎达７４万多套，产值突破亿元，跃为国内三家Ａ级轮胎企业之一，成为威海创汇大户。
    １９７６年初春，于泮龙从威海橡胶厂调出，奉命创建轮胎厂。资金连拨带借仅有２９６万元。建一座相当规模的工厂，谈何容易！
    一五○挤出机是关键设备，买不起，想法做。三伏天里，于泮龙背着几十斤重的零件，跑烟台、走海阳、奔掖县。机器装好拉回威海那天，他却累得跌倒在车间，昏了过去……
    １９７８年４月２８日生产出第一条轮胎时，于泮龙激动的流出了眼泪。
    为了让中国轮胎早日驶向世界，于泮龙早就憋着一股劲。
    １９８０年，全国轮胎行业处于低谷时期，威海轮胎厂生产的三角牌马车、拖拉机、汽车等轮胎也大量积压，面临倒闭。于泮龙看到许多农民买了１２马力拖拉机，但配不到轮胎。摸准信息后，立即组织生产。这一年上缴利税８０多万元，成为全国轮胎生产定点厂家。
    随着设备的改造，生产线的引进和技术力量的加强，于泮龙计划着未来：生产大型工程轮胎。
    于泮龙为争取到项目，从１９８４年起就跑有关部门，缠磨了４０多个月，“功夫不负有心人”，１９８８年终于被批准了。生产的大型工程轮胎，初步改变了我国长期依赖进口的局面。
    威海轮胎厂生产的“△”牌轮胎已发展到８０个规格品种，销售全国２７个省市，并出口东南亚、东欧、西欧近２０个国家和地区。巴基斯坦商人拉拉列先生说：该厂生产的“△”牌轮胎不亚于日本名牌“ＢＳ”。
    最近，今年５３岁的于泮龙向记者展示了他的创业宏图：我们厂已将钢丝帘线、全钢丝载重车胎、半钢丝轿车胎等三大项目列入企业规划。５月份已开始生产无内胎轮胎，今年第三季度桑塔纳轮胎将投放市场……
