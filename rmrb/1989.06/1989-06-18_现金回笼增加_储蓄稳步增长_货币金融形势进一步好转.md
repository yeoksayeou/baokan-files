Cash withdrawals increase, savings grow steadily: monetary and financial situation further improves

A senior official from the People's Bank of China today in Beijing said that in the first five months of this year, China's monetary and financial situation has further improved. Cash withdrawals have significantly increased, and urban and rural savings deposits have steadily grown. There will be no issue of "white receipts" during the summer agricultural and sideline product procurement season.

From January to May this year, the country's net cash withdrawals amounted to 9.7 billion yuan, which is 10.9 billion yuan more than the same period last year. In the first five months, banks and credit unions increased savings deposits by 52.7 billion yuan, which is 22.1 billion yuan more than the same period last year. The savings deposits, which had briefly declined in early June, have now rebounded.

It is currently the peak season for summer agricultural and sideline product procurement. The senior official from the People's Bank of China stated that this year, various specialized banks have opened multiple channels to raise funds. So far, the procurement funds for major summer grain and oil products have been basically secured. By the end of May, the deposit reserves of various specialized banks with the central bank had reached 41.8 billion yuan, which is sufficient to guarantee the fund needs for summer procurement. This summer, there will be no issue of "white receipts" due to insufficient funds during the agricultural and sideline product procurement.

The senior official from the People's Bank of China emphasized that the further improvement and stabilization of the national monetary and financial situation will be beneficial for the steady development of the national economy. The People's Bank and various specialized banks will continue to implement the tight monetary policy while adjusting the credit structure. We are confident in this.

　　现金回笼增加　储蓄稳步增长
    货币金融形势进一步好转
    本报北京６月１７日讯  中国人民银行总行负责人今天下午在北京发表谈话指出，今年头５个月我国货币金融形势进一步好转，现金回笼大量增加，城乡储蓄存款稳步增长，夏季农副产品收购将不会出现打“白条”现象。
    今年１月至５月，全国现金净回笼９７亿元，比去年同期多回笼１０９亿元。头５个月全国银行和信用社增加储蓄存款５２７亿元，比去年同期多增加２２１亿元。６月上旬曾一度下降的储蓄存款，现在已重新回升。
    现在是夏季农副产品收购旺季。中国人民银行负责人对此表示，今年各专业银行广开渠道筹集资金，到目前为止，夏季粮油等主要农副产品收购资金已经基本落实。５月底，各专业银行在中央银行的存款准备金已达４１８亿元，足够保证夏季收购的资金需要。今年夏季农副产品收购不会因为资金不足出现打“白条”现象。
    中国人民银行负责人强调，全国货币金融形势的进一步好转和稳定，将有利于社会经济的稳步发展。人民银行和各专业银行将继续贯彻紧缩方针，同时注意调整信贷结构。对此，我们是有信心的。　　　　（张继东）
