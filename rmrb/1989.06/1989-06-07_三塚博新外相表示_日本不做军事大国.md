Newly appointed Japanese Foreign Minister Mitsuzuka Hitoshi said in an interview with the *Asahi Shimbun* that "Japan is an economic power, but it will not become a military power. I want to advance diplomacy based on this goal."

The *Asahi Shimbun* published the interview with the new foreign minister today.

Mitsuzuka Hitoshi stated that one of the pillars of Japanese diplomacy is the axis of Japan and the United States, and this policy has not changed. The basic framework of coordination and friendship between Japan and the United States will not be destroyed in the future.

When discussing Japan-Soviet relations, the foreign minister said that the Soviet Union is an important neighbor of Japan. If the Northern Territories issue is resolved and a peace treaty is signed, a genuine friendly relationship can be established. He expressed his intention to further expand political dialogue between Japan and the United States and work to improve bilateral relations.

Mitsuzuka Hitoshi also stated that he will engage in direct dialogue with the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

When asked about how he views Japan's war responsibility in World War II, Mitsuzuka Hitoshi said that as Japan's foreign minister and a politician, he will deeply reflect on this with regard to China, the entire Asia, the Korean Peninsula, and Siberia, and use this as a starting point to advance diplomacy.

    日本不做军事大国
    新华社东京６月７日电  新上任的日本外相三塚博在接受《朝日新闻》记者采访时说，“日本是个经济大国，但不做军事大国，我想根据这一目标推进外交。”
    《朝日新闻》今天刊登了这位新外相的答记者问。
    三塚博表示，日本外交的支柱之一是以日美为轴心，这一方针没有发生变化，日美协调和友好这一基本格局今后也不会被破坏。
    在谈及日苏关系时，这位外相说，苏联是日本的重要邻国，如果解决了北方领土问题，缔结和约，就可以建立起真正的友好关系。他表示今后要进一步扩大日美之间的政治对话，努力改善双方关系。
    三塚博还表示将同朝鲜民主主义人民共和国进行直接对话。
    当记者问及怎样认识第二次世界大战中日本的战争责任时，三塚博说，他作为日本的外相、一名政治家，将向中国、整个亚洲、朝鲜半岛以及西伯利亚作出深刻的反省，并以此为立足点来推进外交。
