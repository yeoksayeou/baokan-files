	Gorbachev Meets with U.S. Military Chief

	MOSCOW, June 21 (Xinhua) -- Soviet leader Gorbachev today received the Chairman of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff, Crowe, who is on an official visit to the Soviet Union.

	According to Tass, Gorbachev emphasized the importance of regular contact between the military leaders of the two countries, saying this would make a significant contribution to improving Soviet-U.S. relations. He said that the Soviet leadership and the majority of Soviet people advocate improving Soviet-U.S. relations, advocating mutual respect, equality, and consideration of national security.

	At the same time, the Soviet leader pointed out that in the speeches of some U.S. leaders, one can still hear the tone of nuclear threats and "cold war." He believes that the times require the establishment of civilized relations, respecting the freedom of peoples to choose their social and national systems.

	Crowe arrived in the Soviet Union on June 12. During his visit, he signed an agreement with the First Deputy Minister of Defense and Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Armed Forces, Moiseyev, to prevent dangerous military actions between the U.S. and the Soviet Union.

	At the end of the visit, Crowe and Moiseyev said at a press conference that there are still disagreements and differences on some issues, but it is important that "the visit has deepened mutual understanding."
