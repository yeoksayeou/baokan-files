The Ministry of Railways Office in Beijing reported: Since May 16, some regions have seen students storming train stations and forcibly boarding trains heading to Beijing. In some places, students have lain on the tracks and blocked passenger and freight trains, severely disrupting normal transportation order.

Forcibly entering stations to board trains to Beijing. Since May 16, this has occurred at major passenger stations. From May 16 to 24, there were 375 such incidents on trains heading to Beijing, averaging over 40 incidents per day. For example, on May 18, the 280th train from Xi'an to Beijing had over 3,000 students forcibly board, causing the train's springs to fail and endangering the safety of the journey. After local government persuasion, over 1,000 students disembarked, and the train departed 5 hours and 5 minutes late. On May 19, the 298th train from Jinan to Beijing had over 600 students enter the depot and board the train, causing the train to be unable to leave the depot. Local government persuasion was ineffective, and the train was forced to be canceled. On May 19, over 1,000 students boarded the 18th express train from Sanqiaoshu to Beijing. Persuasion was ineffective, and the train departed 6 hours late.

Lying on the tracks to block trains. There were 11 such incidents. For example, on May 19, students in Fuzhou lay on the tracks, blocking passenger trains and interrupting train operations for over 5 hours. On May 21, students from Qufu Normal University lay on the tracks, blocking three passenger trains. On May 21, over 1,000 students from Southwest Jiaotong University stormed the Emei station, stopping the 92nd train and blocking two freight trains, causing the trains to be delayed by over 8 hours. On May 24 at 5:15 AM, over 200 students in Xi'an lay on the tracks at Xi'an station, causing the Xi'an railway hub and the Longhai Line to be interrupted for over 2 hours.

Under the pretext of intercepting military transport trains, students set up checkpoints at some stations to inspect trains heading to Beijing. Due to the obstruction of normal train operations, the running order was disrupted, causing some sections to be chaotic and train operations to be interrupted. Some even opened the seals on freight cars for inspection, compromising the safety of transported goods. On May 21 around 4 PM, over 5,000 students in Xuzhou stormed the station, occupying the military transport platform, control room, north side of the shunting yard, and south side of the passenger car yard, inspecting and intercepting military transport trains. This forced the station to stop receiving and dispatching trains, and some shunting locomotives stopped operating until 7:30 PM before operations were basically restored, severely impacting normal transportation order. Stations in Zhengzhou, Jinan, Shenyang, Yuhong, Chifeng, Tongliao, Maocun, Shatan, Yanzhou, Baoding, and other places also experienced incidents of intercepting and inspecting military transport trains.

According to incomplete statistics, from May 16 to 31, 200,226 out-of-town students boarded 457 passenger trains to reach Beijing; 215,440 students boarded 381 passenger trains to leave Beijing (including some who came to Beijing by bus). Among them, 6 temporary passenger trains were specially added to transport students leaving Beijing. Additionally, 47,582 out-of-town students heading to Beijing were persuaded to disembark from 183 passenger trains.

To ensure smooth railway transportation, the Ministry of Railways and railway bureaus have taken numerous measures, requiring all railway workers to stay at their posts, follow orders, maintain discipline, and do their jobs well. Leaders at all levels have gone to the front lines of transportation production, strengthened duty shifts, organized forces to persuade students heading to Beijing, and promptly solved existing problems. Despite the railway department's extensive efforts, due to the large scale and wide scope of this student movement, it still had a significant impact on railway transportation:

First, it disrupted the normal order of passenger transportation. From May 16 to 29, there were 457 passenger trains heading to Beijing with collective students on board. Among them, 181 trains heading to Beijing were stopped midway to persuade students, and 66 starting trains were canceled, affecting 845 passenger trains. The delayed trains ranged from a few dozen minutes to over 10 hours. To avoid students forcibly boarding, some trains changed their starting or stopping stations, severely impacting the normal travel and life of the majority of passengers. During this period, the number of passengers sent by the entire railway network decreased significantly. From May 1 to 16, the daily passenger volume was 3,414,000, which decreased to 3,166,000 from May 17 to 28, a daily decrease of 248,000.

Second, the level of loading and unloading and the transportation of key materials decreased. Due to the disorder in passenger transportation, railway transportation could not proceed normally, causing congestion on major railway lines such as Jinghu, Jingguang, Jingha, Jingbao, Longhai, Baocheng, and Chengkun, and at major hubs such as Beijing, Shijiazhuang, Zhengzhou, Wuhan, Xuzhou, Xi'an, Shenyang, and Harbin. The good trend of increasing transportation levels in May was reversed. From May 1 to 16, the daily loading volume was 74,712 cars, which decreased to 73,030 cars from May 17 to 28, a daily decrease of 1,682 cars. The daily unloading volume decreased by 2,602 cars compared to the previous 16 days, and the daily coal loading volume decreased by 1,435 cars.

Third, it affected railway transportation revenue. Since May 16, due to the abnormal railway transportation, the volume of passenger and freight transportation decreased, significantly reducing railway revenue. It is estimated that during this period, passenger transportation revenue decreased by 90 million yuan, of which Beijing Station alone lost over 700,000 yuan per day. Freight transportation revenue decreased by over 20 million yuan. Additionally, due to the decrease in material transportation volume, the impact on national economic development is incalculable.

Currently, the majority of out-of-town students in Beijing have returned. The railway transportation order has basically returned to normal, and passenger and freight transportation have begun to increase. In addition to continuing to do a good job of transporting students returning home, the railway department is currently working hard to rectify the transportation order and striving to make railway transportation better.

### 正常秩序受到冲击　运输形势发生逆转  动乱给铁路运输造成严重影响

    正常秩序受到冲击　运输形势发生逆转
    动乱给铁路运输造成严重影响
    新华社北京6月3日电　铁道部办公厅消息：5月16日以后，一些地区陆续发生学生冲击车站、强行登乘进京客车的情况，一些地方还发生学生卧轨、拦截客货列车的情况，严重打乱了正常运输秩序。
    强行冲进车站登乘进京列车。从5月16日以来，在较大的客运站均有发生。仅5月16日至24日进京列车共发生375起，平均每天40多起。如5月18日，西安—北京的280次客车，有3000余名学生强行上车，客车弹簧压死，危及行车安全。经地方政府劝阻，1000多名学生下车，列车晚点5小时05分发车。5月19日，济南—北京的298次客车，600余名学生进入车库登上列车，造成车体不能出库，地方政府劝阻无效，列车被迫停开。5月19日，三棵树开往北京的18次特快列车，1000多名学生上车，劝阻无效，晚点6小时开车。
    卧轨拦截列车。前后发生11起。如5月19日福州车站学生卧轨，阻拦客车，中断行车达5个多小时。5月21日，曲阜师大学生卧轨拦截列车，共有三列客车受阻。5月21日，西南交大1000多名学生冲进峨眉车站，拦停92次客车，并将两列货车拦住，使列车晚点8个多小时。5月24日5时15分，西安市有200多名学生在西安站卧轨拦车，使西安铁路枢纽和陇海线运输中断2个多小时。
    以拦截军运列车为名，在一些车站设卡检查进京客、货列车。由于阻拦列车正常运行，打乱了运行秩序，造成一些区段运输混乱，中断行车。有的还打开棚车铅封进行检查，使运输物资的安全得不到保证。5月21日16时左右，徐州地区5000多学生冲进车站，占据军运站台、运转室、运转场北部、客车场南部，检查拦截军运列车，迫使该站停止接发列车，部分调车机车停止作业，直到19时30分才基本恢复作业，严重影响正常运输秩序。郑州、济南、沈阳、于洪、赤峰、通辽、茅村、沙塘、兖州、保定等车站也发生了拦截、检查军运列车的情况。
    据不完全统计，5月16—31日，有外地学生200226人分乘457列客车到达北京；有215440名学生分乘381列客车离开北京（包括一些乘汽车来京的学生），其中，为运送离京学生，专门加开了6列临时客车。另外，还从183列客车上劝阻下了47582名外地进京学生。
    为了确保铁路运输畅通，铁道部、铁路局均采取了不少措施，要求全路职工坚守岗位，服从命令，严守纪律，搞好工作。各级干部深入运输生产第一线，加强值班，组织力量劝阻进京学生，及时解决存在的问题。尽管铁路部门做了大量工作，但因这次学潮规模大，面广，对铁路运输仍造成了较大影响：
    一、打乱了正常旅客运输秩序。5月16—29日，全路共有457列进京列车上有集体进京的学生，其中有181列进京客车因劝阻学生在途中停留，有66列始发列车停运，影响到845列客车晚点，晚点列车少则几十分钟，多的长达10多个小时。为了避开学生强行上车，一些列车改变始发站或停车站，严重影响了广大旅客正常的旅行生活。这段时期，全路发送旅客人数明显减少。5月1—16日，客运量日均为341.4万人，17—28日下降为316.6万人，日均减少24.8万人。
    二、装卸车和重点物资运输水平下降。由于客运秩序紊乱，铁路运输一度不能正常进行，造成京沪、京广、京哈、京包、陇海、宝成、成昆等主要铁路干线和北京、石家庄、郑州、武汉、徐州、西安、沈阳、哈尔滨等主要枢纽一度阻塞，5月以来运输水平持续上升的好形势发生逆转。5月1—16日，全路日均装车为74712车，17—28日日均装车为73030车，日均少装1682车，卸车比前16天每天减少2602车，煤炭装车比前16天每天减少1435车。
    三、影响铁路运输收入。5月16日以来，由于铁路运输不正常，客货运量下降，使铁路收入显著减少。据初步估计，在这期间客运收入减少9000万元，其中仅北京站每天就少收入70多万元，货运收入约减少2000多万元。另外，由于物资运量减少，对国民经济发展造成的影响是难以计算的。
    目前，在京外地学生绝大多数已返回。铁路运输秩序已基本恢复正常，客货运输已开始上升。铁路部门除继续搞好学生的返程运输工作外，正全力整顿运输秩序，争取把铁路运输搞得更好。
