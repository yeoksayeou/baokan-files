Title: The Small Temple with Great Magic—On the Dongguan City Labor Service Company

This cannot be considered anything less than a miracle. Dongguan City, with a population of 1.26 million in Guangdong Province, has seen over 300,000 surplus rural laborers transition to non-agricultural industries in just eight years, and has also absorbed over 400,000 migrant workers from other regions.

People say that the city and district (town) labor service companies have played a significant role in this achievement.

When the winds of reform awakened Dongguan, the people of Dongguan realized their advantage of being close to Hong Kong and Macau, allowing them to fully develop "three-in-one, one-compensation" enterprises. However, as soon as they opened up, they encountered a shortage of labor. They realized that for Dongguan to take off, relying solely on local labor was not enough.

Thus, a unique institution—the labor service company—was born.

Although the municipal company has only about twenty staff members and the district (town) companies together have only about 120, their reach is vast! Some jokingly refer to them as the "police of the Pacific." They handle everything from labor service introductions and labor markets to wages, benefits, and education and training. Almost any matter related to migrant workers falls under their purview.

Now, the small city of Dongguan has established "hotlines" with over ten provinces and more than twenty counties and cities across the country. Information related to labor inflow and outflow can be quickly communicated and transmitted.

Guanghan City in Sichuan, one of Dongguan's labor import points, issued over 50,000 cards this year to register all surplus rural laborers in the city, categorizing them by skill level and providing laborers as needed.

According to a contract, the Yulin region in Guangxi is currently training 300 laborers with basic electronic skills for Dongguan. This batch of laborers will gradually enter Dongguan in June.

During the Spring Festival this year, a large number of migrant workers headed south, causing chaos in many places. Dongguan, however, remained calm. This was mainly due to the labor service companies' proactive work. Before the Spring Festival, they clearly instructed migrant workers not to spread false information about Dongguan needing labor and not to bring people in without proper arrangements. According to standard procedures, the labor service company's job is done once they introduce laborers to the employing units. However, Dongguan, which transfers about 80,000 rural laborers annually, has broken this routine. As soon as migrant workers enter Dongguan, the service company helps them obtain temporary residence permits, temporary employment certificates, and food supply cards for management.

For regions with a high output of labor, the company requires the other party to send personnel for joint management.

The labor service company both "manages" and "protects" migrant workers. Last year, due to issues on the factory's end, a shoe factory in Huacheng Town did not operate normally and withheld three months' wages from migrant workers. The labor service company intervened promptly upon learning of this, ensuring that the migrant workers received their wages in full. They also sought the migrant workers' opinions and reassigned over twenty of them to another enterprise. Migrant workers who have left their hometowns to work in Dongguan all consider the labor service company their caring "home."

Of course, if migrant workers unreasonably fail to fulfill their contracts, the labor company will not be lenient. Some migrant workers, upon arriving in Dongguan, do not take their contracts seriously, frequently changing jobs, causing trouble for the enterprises. The service company, together with local management personnel, conducts serious criticism and education of such individuals. For those with severe offenses, their temporary residence permits and temporary employment certificates are revoked, and they are sent back to their original locations.

In recent years, Dongguan's "three-in-one, one-compensation" enterprises have seen new developments each year, but they have never worried about a lack of labor. In just 1988, Dongguan's total industrial and agricultural output value reached 5.12 billion yuan, and fiscal revenue reached 240 million yuan. Without the labor service company's meticulous organization of labor import and export work, this would have been unimaginable.

### “庙”小神通大——记东莞市劳动服务公司

    “庙”小神通大
    ——记东莞市劳动服务公司
    陈秋中
    这不能不算是一个奇迹。一百二十六万人口的广东省东莞市，八年间，不仅本地有三十多万农村剩余劳动力转向非农产业，而且接纳了四十多万外地农民。
    人们都说，这里有市和各区（镇）劳动服务公司的一份汗马功劳。
    当改革的春风把东莞吹醒时，东莞人看清了自己邻近港澳，可以放手发展“三来一补”企业的优势。可是，一放开就遇到了劳动力不足的问题。他们意识到，东莞要起“飞”，光靠本地人还不行。
    于是，一种特殊的机构——劳动服务公司诞生了。
    别看市公司才二十来号人，各区（镇）公司总共才一百二十多人，但“庙”小神通大，管的事可宽啦！有人戏称他们是“太平洋的警察”。他们既管劳动服务介绍，又管劳务市场；既管工资待遇，又管教育培训。与务工农民沾边的事，几乎没有不管的。
    如今，小小的东莞已和全国的十多个省市的二十多个县市接通了“热线”。有关劳务进出的信息，都能迅速沟通、传递。
    东莞劳务输入点之一的四川广汉市，今年用五万多张卡片对全市的农村剩余劳动力进行逐一登记，并按劳动力的素质分类，随时按需提供劳动力。
    按一项合同的要求，广西玉林地区正在为东莞培训三百名懂一定电子技术的劳动力。今年六月，这批劳动力将陆续输进东莞。
    今年春节前后，大批农民南下，许多地方为此焦头烂额，东莞却很平静。这主要也是因为劳动服务公司把工作做在了前面。春节前，他们就明确要求外地农民工回去后不要盲目宣传东莞要人，更不能不经联系随便带人来。按照常规，劳动服务公司把劳动力介绍到用工单位就算完事了。可是，每年以八万人左右速度转移农村劳动力的东莞却打破了这个常规。外地农民工一进东莞，服务公司就帮助他们办理暂住证、临时就业证、粮食供应卡等证件，以便管理。
    对输出劳动力较多的地区，公司要求对方派人进行联合管理。
    劳动服务公司对农民工既“管”也“保”。去年，厚街镇鞋厂由于厂方原因开工不正常，停发了农民工三个月的工资。劳动服务公司得知后及时出面干预，使农民工如数领到了工资。他们还进一步征求农民工的意见，将二十多名农民工调剂到另一家企业工作。远离家乡来东莞做工的农民都把劳动服务公司当成贴心的“娘家”。
    当然，如果农民工无理不履行合同，劳动公司也决不迁就。有的农民工初到东莞，把合同不当一回事，这山望着那山高，三天两头“跳槽”，苦了企业。服务公司就同当地管理人员一道，对他们进行严肃的批评教育。个别情节严重的，就收回暂住证、临时就业证，退回原地。
    近几年，东莞“三来一补”企业年年都有新发展，但从没为缺少劳动力发过愁。仅仅一九八八年，东莞的工农业总产值就达五十一点二亿元，财政收入达二点四亿。如果没有劳动服务公司对劳务输出入工作的精心组织，这是不可想象的。
