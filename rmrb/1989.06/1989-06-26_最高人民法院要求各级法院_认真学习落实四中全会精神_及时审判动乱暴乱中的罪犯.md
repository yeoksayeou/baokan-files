The Supreme People's Court requires all levels of courts to seriously study and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and promptly try criminals involved in turmoil and riots.

New China News Agency, Beijing, June 26th: Supreme People's Court President Ren Jianxin presided over a meeting of senior leaders of the Supreme People's Court this afternoon to seriously study the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the Thirteenth Central Committee and convey the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session.

The attendees firmly supported the Fourth Plenary Session's decision to remove Zhao Ziyang from his positions as General Secretary and other posts due to his serious errors in supporting the counter-revolutionary turmoil and splitting the party. They also firmly supported the new leadership core of the Party Central Committee, led by Jiang Zemin, which was adjusted after the Fourth Plenary Session. Everyone believed that this meeting is a very important one in the history of the Party's development. It not only plays a major role in stabilizing the national situation at present but will also have a far-reaching impact on ensuring the continuity of the Party's line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee and the "one center, two basic points" proposed by the Thirteenth National Congress in the future, and on firmly adhering to the fundamental principles of the state and walking the path to a strong nation.

Ren Jianxin said at the meeting that Zhao Ziyang committed serious errors in supporting the turmoil and splitting the party during the incident that developed from a student movement into turmoil and then into a counter-revolutionary riot. The nature of his errors and the consequences are extremely serious. During his tenure as the head of the Central Committee, he took a negative attitude towards the principle of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, seriously neglected the construction of the party, spiritual civilization, and ideological and political work, and caused great harm to the cause of the party.

Ren Jianxin said that we firmly believe that the new leadership collective, led by Jiang Zemin, elected by the Fourth Plenary Session, will definitely become a united, combat-effective, and strong leadership core that represents the fundamental interests of the whole party and the people of all nationalities, leading the whole party and the people of all nationalities to achieve the strategic goals set by the Thirteenth National Congress and complete the historic mission entrusted by the party and the people.

Ren Jianxin proposed that judicial personnel should seriously study the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session, combine it with reality, raise their awareness, and implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session in the work of the courts. He also emphasized that the current focus and urgent task of the courts nationwide is to promptly try counter-revolutionaries and serious criminal offenders involved in counter-revolutionary riots and social turmoil in accordance with the law, and to carry out the struggle to completely quell counter-revolutionary riots and stop social turmoil to the end.

Ren Jianxin pointed out that the struggle to completely quell riots and stop turmoil should be combined with the severe crackdown on serious criminal offenders. Seize this opportunity to deal a heavy blow to various criminals who seriously endanger social order. Ren Jianxin said that the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session points out: "Resolutely punish corruption, earnestly do a few things that the people generally care about, and do not disappoint the people's expectations of the party." To this end, all levels of courts must urgently fight against serious crimes in the economic field such as embezzlement, bribery, speculation, smuggling, and private trading. Ren Jianxin said that the Supreme People's Court should play a good role in judicial supervision in the struggle to quell counter-revolutionary riots, follow the spirit of the central instructions, combine it with the actual situation of major cases in various places, organize forces, and seriously study the legal application issues of some cases in counter-revolutionary riots and turmoil, timely and effectively guide the trial work, and make due efforts and contributions to implement the four major tasks that the Fourth Plenary Session proposed to focus on at present.

　　最高人民法院要求各级法院    
    认真学习落实四中全会精神  及时审判动乱暴乱中的罪犯
    新华社北京６月２６日电  最高人民法院院长任建新今天下午主持召开高法领导干部会议，认真学习党的十三届四中全会公报，并且传达了四中全会精神。
    与会同志坚决拥护四中全会根据赵紫阳同志在反党反社会主义的动乱中和他主持中央工作以来所犯的严重错误，撤销赵紫阳的总书记及其他职务的决定；坚决拥护经过四中全会调整后的以江泽民同志为总书记的党中央新的领导核心。大家认为，这次会议在我们党的历史发展上是一次非常重要的会议，不仅对于当前进一步稳定全国局势具有重大作用，而且对今后坚持立国之本，走好强国之路，即保证十一届三中全会以来党的路线、方针、政策和十三大提出的“一个中心，两个基本点”的连续性，必将产生深远的影响。
    任建新在会上说，赵紫阳同志在这次由学潮发展为动乱以至反革命暴乱的事件中，犯了支持动乱和分裂党的严重错误，其错误性质和造成的后果是极为严重的。他主持中央工作以来，消极对待坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的方针，严重忽视党的建设、精神文明建设和思想政治工作，给党的事业造成了极大的损失。
    任建新说，我们坚信，四中全会选出的以江泽民同志为总书记的新的领导集体，一定能够成为团结的、有战斗力的、代表全党全国人民根本利益的坚强领导核心，领导全党全国各族人民实现党的十三大确定的战略目标，完成党和人民赋予的历史重任。
    任建新提出，法院同志要认真学习四中全会公报，联系实际，提高认识，把四中全会的精神，落实到法院各项工作中去。他并且强调，当前全国法院工作的重点和面临的紧迫任务，就是要及时依法审判进行反革命暴乱和制造社会动乱的反革命分子和严重刑事犯罪分子，把彻底平息反革命暴乱、制止社会动乱的斗争抓到底。
    任建新指出，要把彻底平息暴乱、制止动乱的斗争同严厉打击严重刑事犯罪分子结合起来。抓住这个有利时机，对各种严重危害社会治安的犯罪分子，给予有力打击。任建新说，四中全会公报指出：“坚决惩治腐败，切实做好几件人民普遍关心的事情，决不辜负人民对党的期望。”为此，各级法院必须抓紧同贪污、受贿、倒买倒卖、走私贩私等经济领域的严重犯罪作斗争。任建新说，最高人民法院在平息反革命暴乱的斗争中，要很好地发挥审判监督职能作用，要遵循中央的指示精神，联系各地大案要案的实际情况，组织力量，认真研究处理反革命暴乱和动乱中一些案件的适用法律问题，适时有力地指导好审判工作，为落实四中全会提出的当前特别要抓好的四件大事做出应有的努力和贡献。
