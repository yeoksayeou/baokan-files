The All-China Federation of Trade Unions reported that Niezhi Fu, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, emphasized today that the urgent task before us is to maintain social stability, which is the key issue. Every worker should uphold this stability.

This afternoon, Niezhi Fu convened a meeting with the chairpersons of 17 national industrial trade unions, including those from railways, telecommunications, hydropower, light industry, and urban construction, to discuss how trade unions can further play a role in stopping the turmoil and maintaining stability. The attendees unanimously expressed their support for the major decisions made by the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and also reflected the wishes and demands of workers and trade union cadres in various industries.

In his concluding remarks at the meeting, Niezhi Fu said, "Today, we invited the chairpersons of various national industrial trade unions to hold a discussion on the views of industrial workers on the current situation and their wishes and demands. Everyone, in their speeches, unanimously supported the important speeches by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun, and the series of major measures taken by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to stop the turmoil and maintain stability. Everyone unanimously agreed that in the face of this severe political struggle, the Chinese working class has shown a broad perspective and a sense of the bigger picture, demonstrating that they are not only the main force in developing productive forces but also the main force in maintaining stability and unity. In the current situation, we must clearly uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and resolutely oppose the attempts by a small number of people to incite unrest, organize strikes, and create turmoil. I fully agree with everyone's views. Here, on behalf of the All-China Federation of Trade Unions, I would like to extend my warm greetings and express my highest respect to all ethnic workers across the country who have remained at their production and work posts and made significant contributions to maintaining stability."

Niezhi Fu said, "The urgent task before us now is to maintain social stability, which is the key issue. Every comrade should uphold this stability. Only by maintaining stability can we push forward with reforms and develop the economy. The country will have a future, the Chinese nation will have hope, and the people will benefit. The stability of the workforce plays a crucial role in the stability and unity of the entire society. Social instability affects reforms, the economy cannot progress, and the ones who suffer are the working class and the people of the entire country. The demands raised by the broad masses of students to oppose official profiteering, punish corruption, promote democracy, improve the legal system, and hope for social progress and national prosperity are good intentions and are consistent with the goals of the Party, the government, and the broad masses of workers. Only under the conditions of a stable and united society, within the framework of democracy and the legal system, can these problems be solved. We sincerely hope that the students will quickly return to their original places and resume classes as soon as possible. Currently, trade union organizations at all levels should mobilize the broad masses of workers to stay at their posts, do a good job in production and work, increase effective supply, and maintain a stable and united political situation with practical actions. We should actively support the People's Liberation Army, armed police, and public security officers in maintaining social order, assist the government and administration, and vigorously rectify the order of social production, work, teaching, and living."

He said, "The Chinese trade union is a mass organization of the working class led by the Communist Party of China, an important social and political organization in China, and a representative and defender of the interests of the workers. The history of the Chinese workers' movement shows that since the birth of the Chinese trade union, it has always fought under the leadership of the Party. The workers of our country and the broad masses of trade union workers have deeply realized from their long-term practice that without the Communist Party, there would be no New China, no great achievements of reform and opening up, no victory of socialist modernization, and no master status of the Chinese working class. Now, a small number of people are using the name of workers' organizations and the banner of 'self-governing unions' to create all kinds of lies, not only to make the trade unions break away from the leadership of the Party but also to make the trade unions into a political force opposed to the Communist Party of China and the socialist system of our country. This plot to sow discord between the trade unions and the Party, split the ranks of workers, and create chaos in ideology and organization has been firmly opposed by the broad masses of workers. Their ulterior political motives are doomed to failure."

Niezhi Fu said, "Trade union organizations at all levels should unswervingly adhere to the guidelines and tasks set by the 11th National Congress of Trade Unions, faithfully perform their social functions of maintaining, building, participating, and educating. While maintaining the overall interests of the people of the whole country, we should better express and maintain the specific interests of the workers, actively promote trade union reforms, and build the Chinese trade union into a mass organization of the working class led by the Communist Party of China, independent and autonomous, fully democratic, and trusted by the masses. Trade union cadres should go deep into the workers, carefully understand the mood of the masses, do more ideological guidance and conflict resolution work, reflect the demands of the workers through normal democratic channels to safeguard the master status of the working class, eliminate corruption, curb inflation, achieve fair distribution, strengthen social order, and better play the role of trade unions in democratic participation and social supervision of government administration."

Niezhi Fu expressed his belief that the broad masses of trade union cadres will certainly maintain consistency with the Party Central Committee, stay at their posts, and fulfill their duties to ensure normal work order and maintain stability and unity.

　　倪志福在全国产业工会主席座谈会上强调
    每个职工都应维护稳定大局
    工会干部要深入群众多做思想疏导工作
    新华社北京６月２日电  全国总工会消息，全国总工会主席倪志福今天强调指出，当前摆在我们面前的紧迫任务是维护社会的稳定，这是大局，每一个职工都应该维护这个大局。
    今天下午，倪志福召集铁路、邮电、水电、轻工、城建等１７个全国产业工会的主席，就工会在当前制止动乱、稳定大局中进一步发挥作用等问题进行了座谈。与会同志一致表示拥护党中央、国务院的重大决策，同时反映了各产业系统职工和工会干部的愿望和要求。
    倪志福在会议结束时讲话说，今天，我们请各位全国产业工会主席开个座谈会，就产业工人对当前形势的看法和他们的愿望、要求，进行座谈。大家在发言中一致拥护李鹏、杨尚昆同志的重要讲话，拥护党中央、国务院为制止动乱、稳定大局所采取的一系列重大措施。大家一致认为，在这场严重的政治斗争面前，我国工人阶级识大体，顾大局，表明自己不仅是发展生产力的主力军，而且是维护安定团结的主力军。在当前形势下，我们必须旗帜鲜明地坚持四项基本原则，坚决反对极少数人蓄意挑起事端，煽动罢工，制造动乱的活动。我完全赞同大家的看法。在这里，我代表中华全国总工会向坚守生产和工作岗位，为稳定大局作出重大贡献的全国各族职工，表示亲切的问候，致以崇高的敬意。  　倪志福说，当前，摆在我们面前的紧迫任务是维护社会的稳定，这是大局，每一个同志，都应当维护这个大局。只有在稳定中推进改革，发展经济，国家才有前途，中华民族才有希望，人民群众才能得到实惠。职工队伍的稳定，对于全社会的安定团结起着关键性的作用。社会不安定，改革受影响，经济上不去，受损害的还是工人阶级和全国人民。广大学生提出的反对官倒，惩治腐败，促进民主，健全法制，希望社会进步、国家富强等要求，愿望是好的，是同党、政府和广大职工群众的目标一致的。只有在安定团结的社会条件下，纳入民主和法制的轨道，才有可能解决这些问题。我们深切希望同学们尽快返回原地，尽快复课。当前，各级工会组织要动员广大职工，坚守岗位，搞好生产和工作，增加有效供给，以实际行动维护安定团结的政治局面。要积极支持人民解放军、武装警察、公安干警维护社会治安，协助政府和行政，大力整顿社会生产、工作、教学、生活秩序。
    他说，中国工会是中国共产党领导工人阶级群众组织，是我国重要的社会政治团体，是职工群众利益的代表者和维护者。中国工人运动的历史表明，从中国工会诞生之日起，就始终在党的领导下开展斗争。我国职工和广大工会工作者，从自己的长期实践中深切地认识到，没有共产党就没有新中国，没有共产党就没有改革开放的巨大成就，没有共产党就不可能有社会主义四个现代化的胜利，没有共产党也就不可能有中国工人阶级的主人翁地位。现在有极少数人盗用工人组织的名义，打着“自治工会”的旗号，制造种种谎言，不仅要工会摆脱党的领导，而且要使工会成为同中国共产党和我国社会主义制度对立的政治力量。这种离间工会和党的关系、分裂职工队伍、在思想上和组织上制造混乱的图谋，遭到了广大职工的坚决反对。他们别有用心的政治目的注定要失败。
    倪志福说，各级工会组织要坚定不移地按照中国工会十一大确定的方针任务，忠实地履行自己的维护、建设、参与、教育等社会职能。坚持以经济建设为中心，在维护全国人民总体利益的同时，更好地表达和维护职工群众的具体利益，积极推进工会改革，把中国工会建设成为中国共产党领导的，独立自主、充分民主、群众信赖的工人阶级群众组织。广大工会干部要深入到职工群众中去，悉心体察群众情绪，多做思想疏导和化解矛盾的工作，通过正常的民主渠道，反映职工群众要求保障工人阶级主人翁地位，消除腐败现象、抑制通货膨胀、实现公正分配、强化社会治安等愿望，更好地发挥工会对政府行政工作的民主参与和社会监督作用。
    倪志福表示深信，广大工会干部一定会与党中央保持一致，坚守岗位，尽职尽责，为保证正常工作秩序，维护安定团结做出自己的贡献。
