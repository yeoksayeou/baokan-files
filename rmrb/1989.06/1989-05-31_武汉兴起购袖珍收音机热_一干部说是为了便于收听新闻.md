Wuhan has recently seen an unexpected surge in the purchase of pocket radios, revitalizing the once-neglected radio counters.

In the "Culture City" of Wuchang District, a large department store has seen a steady stream of customers flocking to the radio counters, with a particular preference for multi-band pocket radios. A university student, who bought one for himself and two for his classmates, remarked, "These radios have fine-tuning capabilities and are very easy to use. Plus, they're not expensive, so my classmates all like them."

It is understood that this trend of purchasing portable radios has been ongoing for the past two months, with May seeing the highest sales. Since May 20th, the daily sales have averaged around 160 units, with peak sales reaching nearly 200 units per day.

A government official who specifically came to buy a radio told the reporter, "I bought this multi-band pocket radio to conveniently listen to the news."

　　武汉兴起购袖珍收音机热
    一干部说是为了便于收听新闻
    据新华社武汉５月３１日电（记者熊金超）武汉三镇近日来兴起了一场出人意料的收音机购买热，使备受冷落的收音机柜台生意兴隆。
    在“文化城”武昌城区的一家大型商场，连日来收音机柜台前人头攒动，人们对多波段袖珍收音机分外青睐。一位自己买一只，还帮同学代买两只的大学生说，这种收音机有微调，调谐特别好使，而且价格也不贵，同学们都很喜欢。
    据了解，这种便携式收音机走俏是近两个月的事，尤以５月为甚。２０日以来，日均销量接近１６０台，最高峰时可日售近２００台。
    一位专程来买收音机的机关干部告诉记者，他买这种多段袖珍收音机是为了便于收听新闻。
