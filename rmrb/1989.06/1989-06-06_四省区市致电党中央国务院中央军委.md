The Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission received telegrams from several provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities on June 4, expressing their firm support for the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital. The telegrams are as follows:

	Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region
	Party Central Committee, State Council, Central Military Commission:

	At a time when we are deeply studying and implementing the editorial of the People's Daily on April 26 and the series of important speeches by central leaders, and are full of confidence in the current struggle to stop the turmoil, we have heard on the radio the news that the People's Liberation Army's martial law troops have swiftly suppressed the counter-revolutionary riot and entered Tiananmen Square. We firmly support the major decision and resolute action taken by the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission to stabilize the national situation and safeguard the security of the capital. We deeply feel that the central decision to stop the turmoil and impose martial law in parts of the capital is completely correct.

	The People's Liberation Army, which is loyal to the Party, loyal to the motherland, and loyal to the people, has, at a crucial moment that decides the fate of the nation and the people, faced a small group of arrogant and law-breaking thugs and rioters, and given a resolute counterattack. They have smashed this counter-revolutionary riot, used their blood and lives to defend the people's regime and the dignity of the constitution, and achieved a decisive victory in the struggle. Our army is truly the strong defender of the people's interests and the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	The people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia, located on the northern border of the motherland, express their highest respect and warm greetings to all the officers and soldiers of the martial law troops! We deeply mourn the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who were injured or sacrificed their precious lives in the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot!

	The 20 million people of all ethnic groups in Inner Mongolia firmly support the resolute actions of the martial law troops. We will, with a unified understanding and a unified pace, strive to do a good job in all aspects of work in the region as a strong backbone for the people's army. We hope and firmly believe that the People's Liberation Army will surely not disappoint the trust of the Party and the people, continue to carry forward the "five revolutionary spirits" advocated by Chairman Deng Xiaoping, and strive for a comprehensive victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot and restoring normal order in the capital.

	Sichuan Province
	Party Central Committee:

	At 6:30 AM on June 4, after listening to the People's Central Broadcasting Station's broadcast of the editorial from the People's Liberation Army Daily, "Firmly Support the Party Central Committee's Decision, Resolutely Suppress the Counter-Revolutionary Riot," and the news of the swift suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot by the capital's martial law troops, Comrade Yang Ruzhai immediately convened an emergency meeting of the provincial committee standing committee members who were at home for a discussion. It was unanimously agreed that the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission's decision to take resolute and decisive measures to swiftly suppress the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital is completely correct, and we firmly support it.

	The serious counter-revolutionary riot that occurred in the capital is unprecedented since the founding of the country. It is the result of a small number of people's conspiracy to create turmoil over a period of time, and it is the concentrated exposure of their evil intentions to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party of China, attempt to overthrow the People's Republic of China, and overthrow the socialist system. The Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission's decision to resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionary riot has defended the great People's Republic of China and the sacred constitution, expressing the wishes of the people of the entire country. We express our respect for the heroic People's Liberation Army capital martial law troops and the broad public security and armed police forces for resolutely implementing the Party Central Committee's decision, displaying fearless spirit, and swiftly suppressing this counter-revolutionary riot.

	To stabilize the situation in Sichuan and do a good job, the provincial committee has taken the following measures:

	(1) Immediately organize the broad masses of cadres, party members, and the masses to listen to and watch the news reports about the Beijing martial law troops taking measures to suppress the capital's counter-revolutionary riot, raise their ideological awareness, and clearly support the Party Central Committee's decision, maintaining high unity in thought and action with the Party Central Committee.

	(2) At 8:00 AM on June 4, convene a meeting of the party committee secretaries of higher education institutions in the Chengdu region, requiring all teachers and students of each university to continue classes, not to go out to parade, and not to link up or distribute leaflets, etc. Those who violate the rules will be held accountable.

	(3) At 8:30 AM on June 4, the Chengdu People's South Road Square has been cleared, and dozens of students who were sitting in the square have been taken away from the scene and returned to school.

	(4) All units of government agencies, industrial and mining enterprises must maintain stability and firmly guard their production and work positions, not to go out to parade, and those who violate the rules will be dealt with according to relevant disciplines.

	(5) Immediately notify the committees of all cities, prefectures, and states to closely monitor social trends, grasp the reflections of all sectors, do a good job in a timely manner, and stabilize the situation.

	(6) Public security and armed police forces must maintain high vigilance, firmly guard their positions, maintain good social order, and effectively protect the safety of important departments. Those who take advantage of the situation to engage in beating, smashing, looting, and arson will be severely punished according to law and will not be lenient.

	The provincial committee will convene a meeting of standing committee members and leaders of several major provincial-level organizations in the afternoon of June 4 to report the situation and study further measures to stabilize the situation.

	Shanghai Municipality
	Party Central Committee, State Council, Central Military Commission:

	The Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission have made the correct decision and taken resolute measures to suppress the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing. The Shanghai Municipal Committee convened an emergency meeting of the secretariat and an expanded meeting of the standing committee with district committee and commission office party committee leaders participating early in the morning of June 4. After serious study and discussion, everyone unanimously expressed their firm support.

	The martial law troops and public security police and armed police forces in the capital have carried forward their fine traditions and style, strictly disciplined, endured hardships, loved the people, and swiftly suppressed this counter-revolutionary riot. We hereby express our highest respect and warm greetings to all the officers and soldiers.

	For more than a month, a small number of people have deliberately instigated and created turmoil, which has become increasingly intense and developed into a shocking counter-revolutionary riot, really to the point of being unbearable. If the turmoil continues and the riot is not suppressed, the people will not be at peace, and the country will not be stable. Reform and opening up, and the Four Modernizations will all become a bubble. Resolutely and swiftly suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot is the common wish and unanimous demand of the broad masses of Communists and every patriot.

	The Shanghai Municipal Committee and the Municipal Government will mobilize all Communists and the people of the entire city to jointly strive for stability, maintain stability in Shanghai, firmly guard their positions, continue production, maintain order, and use their actual actions to support the Party Central Committee's correct decision. Support the just actions of the capital martial law troops and public security police and armed police forces.

	Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region
	Communist Party of China Central Committee, State Council:

	This morning, after listening to the editorial of the People's Liberation Army Daily on June 4 and the news of the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital, the autonomous region party committee immediately convened an emergency standing committee meeting at 10:30 AM for a serious discussion. National Committee Vice Chairman and Chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Congress Standing Committee Wang Enmao, and Vice Chairman of the Autonomous Region People's Congress Standing Committee Qi Guo also participated in today's meeting.

	The attendees expressed great indignation and strong condemnation of the heinous crimes of a group of troublemakers who instigated a serious counter-revolutionary riot in the capital! They unanimously firmly supported the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission's decision to resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionary riot, and enthusiastically welcomed the martial law troops and the capital's public security police and armed forces for taking decisive measures to swiftly suppress this riot, achieving a great victory in stopping the turmoil and maintaining the stability and unity of the capital and the country!

	The shocking counter-revolutionary riot that occurred in the capital is unprecedented since the founding of the People's Republic of China. It is the result of a small number of people's conspiracy to create turmoil over a period of time, and it is the concentrated exposure of their evil intentions to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system. Resolutely suppressing this counter-revolutionary riot completely represents the fundamental interests and common wishes of the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of all ethnic groups in the country. The party organizations, governments, and people of all ethnic groups in Xinjiang firmly oppose all turmoil and sincerely support the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission's decision to resolutely suppress the counter-revolutionary riot.

	At a time when the fate of the Party and the state is facing a serious threat, we will, as always, firmly and unshakably maintain unity with the Party Central Committee, resolutely implement all decisions of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, strive to do a good job in Xinjiang, resolutely stop any turmoil, maintain the stability of Xinjiang, and strive to ensure the smooth progress of reform and opening up and all undertakings.

    党中央：
    ６月４日６时３０分，我们在收听了中央人民广播电台广播的解放军报社论《坚决拥护党中央决策，坚决镇压反革命暴乱》和首都戒严部队迅速平息反革命暴乱的消息后，杨汝岱同志赓即召开了在家的省委常委紧急会议，进行了座谈讨论，一致认为，党中央、国务院、中央军委采取坚决、果断的决策，迅速平息了首都的反革命暴乱，是完全正确的，表示坚决拥护。
    这次发生在首都的严重的反革命暴乱，是建国以来从未有过的，这是一个时期以来，极少数人阴谋制造动乱的恶性发展，是他们反对中国共产党的领导，妄图颠覆中华人民共和国、推翻社会主义制度罪恶企图的集中暴露，党中央、国务院、中央军委采取坚决镇压反革命暴乱的决策，捍卫了伟大的中华人民共和国，捍卫了神圣的宪法，表达了全国人民的心愿。对英雄的中国人民解放军首都戒严部队和广大公安、武警部队，坚决执行党中央的决策，发扬大无畏精神，迅速平息了这场反革命暴乱，表示敬意。
    为稳定四川局势，做好工作，省委采取了以下措施：
    （一）立即组织广大干部、党员和群众收听看有关北京戒严部队采取镇压首都反革命暴乱的新闻报道，提高思想认识，旗帜鲜明地坚决支持党中央的决策，同党中央在思想上和行动上保持高度的一致。
    （二）在６月４日上午８时，召开成都地区高等院校党委书记会议，要求各高校的全体师生坚持上课，不得上街游行，更不准串连、散发传单等，违者要予以追究。

    一个多月来，极少数人蓄意煽动和制造的动乱，越演越烈，发展成骇人听闻的反革命暴乱，实在到了使人忍无可忍的地步。动乱不止，暴乱不平，人民不得安宁，国家不得安定。改革开放、四化建设都将成为泡影，坚决、迅速地平息反革命暴乱，是广大共产党员和每个爱国人民的共同心愿和一致要求。
    上海市委、市政府将动员全体共产党员、全市人民共同努力，坚持稳定大局，稳定上海，坚守岗位，坚持生产，维护秩序，用自己的实际行动，拥护党中央的正确决策。支持首都戒严部队和公安干警、武警部队的正义行动。
