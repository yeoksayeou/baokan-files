Mr. Lan Yuzong has dedicated decades to the study and teaching of ethnic music, gaining fame as a music theorist. A few years ago, he suddenly appeared before readers as a calligrapher and quickly gained renown in the domestic and international calligraphy circles. *Wenyi Yanjiu* selected him as one of the four outstanding calligraphers in the country. His works have participated in numerous national calligraphy exhibitions and have been displayed in Japan and Singapore. He has also held two personal exhibitions in Nanjing and Hong Kong. Recently, *Lan Yuzong's Small Regular Script of Song Ci* was published.

How did a musician achieve such high proficiency in calligraphy?

Lan Yuzong comes from a scholarly family and began practicing calligraphy at the age of four. At thirteen, he started studying under a master. He extensively studied epigraphy, calligraphy, and ancient inscriptions, focusing particularly on *The Sutra of the Holy Teaching*, *The Book of Calligraphy*, the inscriptions on Yunfeng Mountain, Jin and Tang scriptures, and Han dynasty bamboo slips. As a young man, he also studied Song poetry under Huang Xiaozai, studied seals under Shou Shih, and learned Chinese painting from Huang Binong. He was highly regarded by some cultural elders and celebrities of that time.

Lan Yuzong, who loves literature, history, calligraphy, and painting, did not establish his reputation in these fields in his early years. In times of national difficulty, he, as a passionate young man, threw himself into the tide of the times. During his university years, he was a student leader, chairman of the student union, and secretary of the underground party branch of the school. Later, he was sent by the organization to work undercover in the Nationalist military and political agencies in the Northeast. After the founding of the nation, he taught and researched ethnic music at the Lu Xun Academy of Arts and the Central Conservatory of Music, making significant contributions to Chinese music history and the erhu, and gaining considerable influence.

Experts know that a piece of calligraphy not only reflects the calligrapher's cultural background and artistic accomplishment but also reveals his personality, temperament, and aesthetic taste. Lan Yuzong's rich experiences and diverse cultural activities undoubtedly promoted his calligraphic art. It is precisely because of this that he was able to absorb the strengths of various schools, digest them, and form a style uniquely his own. He has accumulated decades of calligraphic experience and possesses remarkable talent. However, due to political reasons, he had to "conceal his talents" in the past few decades. His recent emergence in the calligraphy world is not accidental.

The calligraphy community highly praises Lan Yuzong's calligraphic art. Huang Miaozhi said that Lan Yuzong's cursive script, at first glance, seems to come from Huaisu and Zhao Ji, but it completely breaks away from these "traditions," has its own distinct style, and is very vivid. He described Lan Yuzong's calligraphy as powerful, rhythmic, and full of life. If the dynamism of ancient calligraphy is compared to the grace of Princess Sun Wukong's dance, then Lan Yuzong's calligraphy is like modern ballet. Qi Gong said Lan Yuzong has "true insight and great skill."

Think about it, in the bustling world of calligraphy, how many can achieve a unique style?!

In recent years, his cursive script and seal script, both in terms of skill and variation, are extraordinary.

Lan Yuzong is by nature open-minded, generous, and even aloof and proud. Only those who are self-confident can stand alone. This trait is somewhat similar to that of the great cursive script masters of past dynasties! His wild cursive script can be called "unparalleled in China." From a distance, it is like a clear wind and bright moon, with elegant lines. Up close, it is like flying sword shadows. It is calm and composed, but with a piercing glow, making one's heart race and spirit soar.

"Truth, goodness, and beauty are the essence of art; I only want to express myself genuinely." Well said! Those who wish to know Lan Yuzong can learn about him through his calligraphic art.

　　蓝玉崧的书法艺术
    本报记者  赖仁琼
    蓝玉崧先生从事民族音乐研究及教学数十载，以音乐理论家闻名，数年前忽然以书法家面目出现在读者跟前，而且很快蜚声国内外书坛。《文艺研究》把他选为全国杰出的四位书法家之一。他的作品参加过多次全国书展，还到日本、新加坡展出；个人书展也相继在南京、香港举办过两次。前不久出版了《蓝玉崧书宋词小楷》。
    一位音乐家何以在书法艺术上有这样高的造诣呢？
    蓝玉崧出身书香门第，四岁开始练字，十三岁投师学艺。他广泛研习碑学、帖学、金石，对《圣教序》、《书谱》、云峰山刻石、晋唐写经、汉简等用力最勤。少年时代，他还曾拜黄孝纾为师攻宋词，从寿石治金石，向黄宾虹学国画：见重于当时文化界的一些耆宿名流。
    喜爱文史书画的蓝玉崧早年没有以此立身扬名。国运维艰，他以一个热血青年投身时代洪流之中。上大学时是学生领袖、学联主席和学校的地下党支部书记；后来被组织派到东北的国民党军政机关做地下工作。建国以后，他先后在鲁艺和中央音乐学院从事民族音乐教学和研究，在中国音乐史和二胡领域独树一帜，极有影响。
    行家们都知道，一幅字不但可以表现出书法家的文化素质、艺术修养，还可以从中透出他的人格、气质和审美情趣。蓝玉崧的丰富经历和多方面的文化活动，对他的书法艺术无疑起了推动作用，唯其如此，才更加容易博取众家之长，加以消化，形成全然属于蓝玉崧的“这一个”。他在书法上有几十年的丰厚积累和卓荦的才华，只是在近二三十年间由于政治原因使他不得不“韬光隐晦”，近年他在书坛的“异军突起”并不是偶然的。
    书法界对蓝玉崧的书法艺术评价很高。黄苗子说，蓝玉崧的草书，乍看似从怀素和赵佶出来，但完全摆脱了这些“家数”，有了自己的面目，并且还很鲜明，说他的书法气势磅礴，有韵律感和生命力。如果把古人的动感比作公孙大娘的洒脱，那么蓝玉崧的书法则正是现代芭蕾舞。启功则说蓝玉崧有“真见识，大本领”。
    想想看，热热闹闹的书苑，有几人够得上有了自己面目的呢？！
    近年他写的草篆和汉隶，功力既深，且变化有神。
    蓝玉崧生性豁达、豪放，甚至孤高傲岸。唯自信者独来独往。这一点，同历代的草圣不是有几分相似么？！他的狂草堪称“中国一绝”。铁锥划沙，远观如疏风朗月，线条流丽，细看似剑影飞腾。神闲气定，但精光湛湛，看着看着就叫你心驰神摇。
    “真善美是艺术的真谛，我只想真实地表现自己。”说得对！谁想认识蓝玉崧，尽可以从他的书法艺术中去了解他。
