To tackle the current economic challenges, we must adopt a two-pronged approach. On one hand, we need to accelerate the reform of the economic system. On the other hand, we must strengthen macroeconomic control.

Firstly, accelerating the reform of the economic system is crucial. The current economic system has many shortcomings that hinder the development of the national economy. We need to deepen the reform, break through the barriers that restrict the development of productive forces, and unleash the vitality of the economy. This includes further opening up to the outside world, promoting the development of a market economy, and encouraging innovation and entrepreneurship.

Secondly, strengthening macroeconomic control is essential. While promoting reform, we must also pay attention to the overall situation and avoid excessive fluctuations in the economy. This requires strengthening the role of the government in economic regulation, improving the macroeconomic control system, and ensuring the stability and sustainability of economic development. We need to control inflation, stabilize prices, and ensure the basic living standards of the people.

In summary, to achieve sustainable economic development, we must adopt a two-pronged approach: accelerating the reform of the economic system and strengthening macroeconomic control. Only by doing so can we overcome the current difficulties, promote economic growth, and improve the living standards of the people.
