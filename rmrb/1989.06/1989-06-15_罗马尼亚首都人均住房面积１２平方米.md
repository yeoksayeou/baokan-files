Bucharest's per capita housing area has been increasing year by year, reaching 12 square meters currently, basically meeting the standard of one room per person.

According to statistical materials, over the past 20 years, Bucharest has built 600,000 new housing units, of which 350,000 are public housing.

The Romanian government attaches great importance to housing construction and allocates substantial funds each year for building houses. During the current five-year plan (1986-1990), the state has allocated 129 billion lei to build 150,000 housing units for the capital.

Romania's capital combines housing construction with old city renovation, plans comprehensively, and proceeds step by step. Currently, there are 10 new residential areas in the city. These new residential areas have relatively complete supporting service facilities, which can basically meet the living needs of residents.
