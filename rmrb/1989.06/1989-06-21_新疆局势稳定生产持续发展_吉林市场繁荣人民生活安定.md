During the recent turmoil that started in Beijing and spread to many cities across the country, Xinjiang maintained stability, and production and people's lives did not experience any decline or abnormal situations.

It is understood that since May, including the early June period when the counter-revolutionary riot occurred in Beijing, no factories in Xinjiang stopped production, and no shops closed. Among the more than ten colleges and universities and thousands of primary and secondary schools in Xinjiang, except for a few days in mid-May when some students in Urumqi and a few other cities and universities held demonstrations, teaching order has been maintained normally. No university suspended classes. All dance halls and cinemas in the city continued to operate as usual.

Since May, industrial production in the region has continued to grow steadily. In particular, the textile industry, one of Xinjiang's three pillar industries, has seen an increase in both production and profits compared to the same period last year. Foreign trade exports have also seen a significant increase compared to the same period last year. Livestock farming has been successful, with the survival rate of young livestock increasing by 2.74% compared to the same period last year. The condition of the livestock after winter is generally better than in previous years. The total summer grain production is expected to be about 20% higher than last year.

Jilin Province has focused on improving effective supply through production, maintaining a stable and prosperous market, and ensuring the stability of people's lives. From January to May this year, the total retail sales of commodities in the state-owned commercial system in the province increased by 19.6% compared to the same period last year. The retail price index, except for a slight increase in March, has been slightly lower than December last year for the other months.

The supply of meat, vegetables, tofu, and other staple foods, which are closely related to people's lives, is generally good. The procurement and supply of pork are better than in previous years. By June 10, the eight major cities of Changchun, Jilin, and Siping had a vegetable market supply of over 140 million kilograms, an increase of 15.1% compared to the same period last year. Due to the higher temperatures and balanced rainfall, as well as the use of plastic greenhouses for low-temperature rapid-growth vegetables, vegetables such as small white cabbage, early green beans, and rapeseed have been on the market about 10 days earlier than in previous years. According to statistics from the provincial vegetable company on 12 major varieties, the prices of 8 varieties have decreased this year in the first five months. The supply of tofu and dried tofu is sufficient, with more than 10 varieties available daily.

The supply of daily necessities is abundant, with matches, soap, and detergent basically ensuring no shortages or out-of-stock situations.

　　新疆局势稳定生产持续发展  吉林市场繁荣人民生活安定
    本报乌鲁木齐６月２１日电  记者曾坤报道：前一阵子，在由北京发端并且波及到全国许多城市的动乱中，新疆局势始终稳定，生产和人民生活没有出现滑坡和不正常现象。
    据悉，５月份以来，包括６月初北京发生反革命暴乱期间，新疆没有一个工厂停工停产，没有一个商店关门停业，新疆十几所大专院校，几千所中小学，除了５月中旬有二、三天时间乌鲁木齐等地几所大中专的部分学生上街游行之外，始终保持了正常的教学秩序。没有一所大学停过课。全市所有营业性舞厅、所有影剧院也都照常营业。
    进入５月以来，全区工业生产持续稳定增长，特别是新疆三大支柱产业之一的纺织业，产量利润比去年同期都有增长。外贸出口也比去年同期有较大增长幅度。全区畜牧业获得丰收，幼畜成活率比去年同期提高２．７４％，越冬后的畜群膘情普遍好于往年。夏粮总产量可望比去年提高二成左右。
    本报讯　记者李安达报道：吉林省从抓好生产入手提高有效供给，市场稳定繁荣，人民生活安定。今年１至５月，全省国营商业系统商品零售总额比去年同期增长１９．６％，零售物价指数除３月略有上升外，其他几个月均比去年１２月份略有下降。
    跟人民生活关系重大的肉、菜、豆制品等副食品，收购和供应形势都比较好。生猪收购好于往年，到６月１０日，长春、吉林、四平等８个主要城市蔬菜上市量达１．４亿多公斤，比去年同期增１５．１％。由于气温偏高，雨水调和，同时利用塑料大棚搞低温速生菜，小白菜、早豆角、油菜等春菜比往年提前１０多天上市。据省蔬菜公司对１２个主要品种统计，今年头５个月价格下降的有８个。大豆腐、干豆腐能满足供应，小品种每天都有１０个以上。
    日用工业品货源充足，火柴、肥皂、洗衣粉等基本做到了不脱销，不断档。
