Title: Casual Talk on "Getting Things Straight"

The phrase "getting things straight" is quite popular in certain parts of Northeast China. If you want to get a promotion or a job, someone might advise you to "get things straight" with your superiors; if an enterprise needs production materials, it often sends someone to "get things straight" with the relevant departments; if an ordinary person has a major or minor illness, someone might remind them to "get things straight" with the doctor... If something hasn't been done, someone is sure to tease you for not "getting things straight."

"Getting things straight" essentially means bribing those in charge to make things go smoothly. Although this phrase is used in Northeast China, the meaning it conveys is familiar to people in all regions. Some things are actually quite easy to handle, but they just can't be done without pulling strings and going through the back door to "get things straight." As a result, those who handle the matters lose their integrity, and those in charge lose their principles, trading integrity and principles for each other.

In today's society, those who can "get things straight" are actually not many. They are called "having the ability to get things done," "knowing how to handle things," "being quick-witted," and "having good relationships," which all seem to be words of praise, but they actually contain negative connotations.

Because these people are so smooth-talking and ingratiating, they often gain the favor of certain people in power. Even if they are not competent at work, they can often be promoted and given important positions. Some "discipline" and "strict standards" seem to soften in the face of such people. Getting relatives and friends jobs, moving to the city, and so on, naturally become no big deal. A young man who had just started working and had average performance managed to join the party, become a cadre, and even be evaluated as an assistant engineer all because he "got things straight." During the "diploma fever," someone even managed to get a college diploma without anyone knowing, and good things kept coming... But for the majority of ordinary people, because they don't have the financial means, opportunities, or the face to "get things straight" for everything, they often end up hitting a wall everywhere they turn.

"Getting things straight" not only damages the party's integrity and social ethics but also makes a large number of talented and upright individuals unable to serve their country. We should deepen our reforms and strengthen our legal system, bringing this problem into the normal track of democracy and the rule of law to solve it.

### 闲话“整明白”

　　闲话“整明白”
    晚国波
    “整明白”这个词儿在东北某些地方很流行。要想晋级、提干，有人劝你去跟领导“整明白”；企业需要生产资料，常常要派专人去和有关部门“整明白”；老百姓有个大病小灾，也有人提醒去和医生“整明白”……如果有事没办成，准有人笑话你“没整明白”。
    “整明白”，意思无非是指把那些管事的人“打点”好，使事情办得顺利一些。这个词儿虽然东北地区有，但所表达的意思却是各地区的群众都很熟悉的。有些事情本来很容易办，但就是办不成，非要拉关系、走后门去“整明白”不可。结果是办事的人丧失人格，管事的人丧失原则，人格和原则作了交易。
    当今社会，凡事能“整明白”的人其实并不多。他们被称为“有活动能力”、“会来事儿”、“脑瓜儿开窍”、“人缘儿好”，看上去都是些赞美之词，其实包含贬义。
    由于这些人八面玲珑，深得某些当权人的“喜欢”，即便工作不称职，也常能受到提拔、重用，一些“纪律”、“硬性标准”在这号人面前“软”了，亲戚朋友就业、户口进城等等自然更算不上什么难事。有位青年刚参加工作不久，而且政绩平平，可他整得“明白”，不但入了党，转了干，还被评为助理工程师；在“文凭热”时，有人竟神不知鬼不觉地弄到了大专文凭，好事接踵而至……但对于大多数平民百姓来说，由于他们没有那么多财力、机会，也舍不出脸面去将样样事情都“整明白”，因而经常是四处碰壁。
    “整明白”不仅损坏了党风和社会风气，也使一大批有真才实学又光明磊落的人才报国无门。我们应该深化改革，加强法制建设，将这个问题纳入民主与法制的正常轨道来加以解决了。
