Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 18th. (Correspondent Wang Chengfeng, Reporter Chen Jiming) By improving the composition of export products and independently developing the global market, Shanghai's mechanical and electrical industry has seen a steady increase in export earnings. Last year, the industry's export earnings increased significantly compared to the previous year. In the first five months of this year, the growth rate was 25% higher than the same period last year.

Shanghai's mechanical and electrical industry has been working to improve the composition of its export products. While vigorously promoting the export of more than 20 internationally popular products, the industry has also been striving to develop high-end mechanical and electrical products. The Shanghai Machine Tool Factory shipped a large, precision thread grinding machine to a European country in the first quarter, which adopted advanced technologies such as computer control and laser measurement precision. This type of world-class machine tool can earn over $100 million in foreign exchange per unit. The Shanghai Machine Tool Company has absorbed and digested imported technologies to develop a series of advanced numerical control machine tools. Among them, the numerical control copying milling center and the numerical control three-point bending machine have reached the world's advanced level of the mid-1980s.

The mechanical and electrical industry in Shanghai, which has implemented the export agency system, has also focused on developing mid-to-high-level international markets. The company established by the Shanghai Machine Tool Factory in Atlanta, Georgia, has organized 22 retailers and has 125 salespeople familiar with the U.S. grinding machine market. The sales network covers 40 states in the major industrial areas of the United States. The implementation of the foreign trade agency system has pushed the enterprise onto the global market, prompting the enterprise to organize production according to international customs.

　　改善出口产品构成　自主开发世界市场
    上海机电产品出口大增
    据新华社上海６月１８日电  （通讯员王承丰，记者陈继明）改善出口产品构成，自主开发世界市场，上海机电行业依靠这两个“翅膀”，使出口创汇逐年上升。去年，全行业出口创汇额比上年有较大幅度增长，今年１至５月又比去年同期增长二成半。
    上海机电行业为改善出口产品构成，在大力推进２０多种国际市场热销产品出口的同时，努力研制开发高档机电产品。上海机床厂一季度出运欧洲某国的大型精密螺纹磨床，采用了电脑控制、激光测量精度等先进技术。这类世界一流水平的机床，出口一台即可创汇１００多万美元。上海机床公司吸收、消化引进技术，研制出一批先进的数控机床，其中数控仿型加工中心、数控三点折弯机等产品，已达到８０年代中期世界先进水平。
    实行了出口代理制的上海机电行业，还着力开发中、高层次的国际市场。上海机床厂在美国佐治亚州亚特兰大市开设的一家公司，已组织了２２个零售商，拥有１２５名熟悉美国磨床市场的推销员，销售网络覆盖了美国主要工业区的４０个州。实行外贸代理制，把企业推上了世界市场，促使企业按照国际惯例组织生产。
