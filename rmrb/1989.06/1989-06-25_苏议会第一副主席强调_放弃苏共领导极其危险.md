	Soviet Deputy Chairman of the Presidium Lukyanov said on June 24, "At this extremely complex and difficult stage, abandoning the political leadership of the CPSU is extremely dangerous."

	He made these remarks in an interview with a reporter from Izvestia. He emphasized that the current reforms are being led by the Communist Party, not by anyone else. Without the CPSU, there would be no political and economic reforms in today's Soviet society, nor would there be a process of democratization, openness, and new political thinking.

	In discussing the multiparty system, Lukyanov pointed out that multiparty systems have not guaranteed the elimination of autocracy or the automatic solution of material and economic problems, regardless of time or place. Only by uniting society around the Party can all the problems currently existing in the Soviet Union be solved. "All power to the Soviets" does not mean abandoning the Party's leadership. The Soviet government and the Party's political work, working together, will increasingly and more fully realize the potential of the socialist system.

　　苏议会第一副主席强调    
    放弃苏共领导极其危险
    新华社莫斯科６月２４日电  苏联最高苏维埃第一副主席卢基扬诺夫２４日说，“在目前极其复杂、困难的阶段，放弃苏共的政治领导作用是极其危险的”。
    他是在接受《消息报》记者采访时说这番话的。他强调，当前的改革不是由别人，而是由共产党领导的。没有苏共，就没有今天苏联社会的政治和经济改革，就没有民主、公开性进程和政治新思维。
    卢基扬诺夫在谈到多党制时指出，无论何时何地，多党制并未保证摆脱专制或自动解决物质和经济问题。只有把社会团结在党的周围，才能解决苏联当前存在的所有问题。“一切权力归苏维埃”，并不是不要党的领导。苏维埃政权同党的政治工作共同努力，就会越来越充分地发挥出社会主义社会制度的潜力。
