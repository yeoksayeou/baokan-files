Chile's first successful case of artificial insemination has been achieved by a team of experts from the Institute of Reproductive Medicine in the capital. This is the second instance worldwide where artificial insemination has resulted in a successful pregnancy.

According to reports, the Chilean expert team had previously attempted the same method in May 1984, successfully impregnating a woman who was unable to conceive.

The experts introduced a 28-year-old Chilean woman who is currently three months pregnant and in good health. Five years ago, this woman had an intrauterine device inserted, which led to blocked fallopian tubes and the loss of her ability to ovulate.

The experts explained that the method of artificial insemination involves extracting the woman's eggs and placing them in a special tube, which is then inserted deep into her vagina. After 48 hours of intercourse with her husband, the tube is removed to check if fertilization has occurred. If fertilization is confirmed, the fertilized egg is then placed in the woman's uterus.

The Chilean experts stated that, to date, no other country has successfully achieved pregnancy using this method.

　　智利人工体内受精成功
    新华社圣地亚哥电  智利首都生殖医学研究所专家小组１７日在这里宣布，智利第一次采用人工体内受精获得怀孕成功。这是世界上采用人工体内受精的方法怀孕成功的第二个例子。据报道，智利专家小组曾在１９８４年５月采用同样的方法首次使一位不能生育的妇女怀孕。
    据智利专家介绍，一位２８岁的智利妇女目前已怀孕３个月，一切正常。这位妇女是５年前因子宫内放置避孕装置后造成输卵管堵塞而失去排卵能力的。
    专家说，这种人工体内受精的方法是先取出这位妇女的卵子，装入一个特殊的小管内，然后把小管置于她的阴道深处，在与其丈夫同房４８小时后，再将小管取出检查卵子是否受孕。她获得受孕，再把受精卵置于妇女的子宫内。
    智利专家们说，到目前为止，世界上尚无其它国家使用这种方法获得怀孕成功的例子。
