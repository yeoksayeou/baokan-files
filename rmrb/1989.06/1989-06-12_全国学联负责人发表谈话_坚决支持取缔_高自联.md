Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 12th.

A leader of the National Student Federation today issued a statement regarding the dissolution of the illegal organization "University Student Self-Governance Union."

The leader pointed out that the "Beijing University Student Self-Governance Union" and its affiliated "Student Self-Governance Associations" in various universities, as well as similar organizations established in some universities outside Beijing, were all illegal from their inception to their formation. We firmly support and endorse the dissolution of the Beijing "High Self-Governance Union" and similar illegal organizations. At the same time, we strongly urge relevant local governments to promptly issue orders to dissolve similar organizations in their regions. We also urge the "High Self-Governance Union" and its affiliated "Student Self-Governance Associations" to immediately cease all activities and dissolve voluntarily.

This leader stated, "We hope that all students can discern right from wrong, further understand the current grave situation, recognize the nature of this struggle, maintain the unity of our student body, oppose and resist any attempts to establish illegal organizations among students, and take active steps to return to school and resume classes as soon as possible, quickly restoring and maintaining normal study and living order."

    据新华社北京６月１２日电  全国学联负责人今天就取缔非法组织“高校学生自治联合会”一事发表谈话。
