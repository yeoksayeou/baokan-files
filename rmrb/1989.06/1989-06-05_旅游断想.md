Tourism is a commodity, and customers must choose. The international tourism industry involves the export of scenic attractions and services. Of course, it is also a bridge for enhancing friendship among peoples of different countries. Tourism, as a special commodity, is participating in international market competition. In 1988, China hosted over 4.3 million organized overseas tourists, earning $2.2 billion in foreign exchange. Generally speaking, this type of non-trade foreign exchange income requires less effort, less investment, and yields more output, with both economic and social benefits being good.

Since it is a commodity, international tourists, as customers, naturally choose and judge based on international standards. Whether it is your tourism methods, routes, projects, or services, they will all be measured and compared against international standards. Therefore, the tourism industry must set its standards not by how much it has improved from the past, but by how it compares to international advanced levels. Only in this way can it have competitiveness in the international market.

“Tourism as the stage, trade as the performance”

In 1988, there was a notable phenomenon: “Tourism as the stage, trade as the performance.” A single tourism activity could bring in billions of dollars in trade deals. This shows the interdependent and mutually beneficial relationship between the tourism industry and relevant sectors of the national economy. Nowadays, it is common to see a mountain enriching a county, a lake enriching a township, or a cave enriching a village. Clearly, developing commercial tourism has great potential.

Services that don’t cost money

Traffic congestion, where tourists can enter but cannot leave, has long been a headache. Solving the traffic problem involves many parties and cannot be done overnight. However, some things do not necessarily require money to achieve. For example, how well is the principle of prioritizing international tourists, as stipulated by the State Council, being implemented? This is not to belittle domestic tourists but is done out of the need to earn foreign exchange and is a form of courtesy. This is one aspect. Secondly, domestic flights often experience delays, with some delays being very long. Shouldn’t there be an apology? Shouldn’t there be proper arrangements for the accommodation and meals of delayed passengers? Unfortunately, some airports do not pay attention to this, and their attitude is cold, which cannot but make passengers angry.

　　旅游断想
    杨泓
    是商品，顾客就得选择
    国际旅游业是风景出口和劳务出口。当然，它还是增进各国人民友谊的桥梁。旅游正作为一种特殊的商品，参与国际市场竞争。１９８８年我国接待有组织的海外旅游者４３０多万人，收汇２２亿美元。一般来讲，这种非贸易外汇收入，比之通过出口商品换取外汇，费劲小，投入少，产出多，经济效益、社会效益均好。
    既然是商品，作为顾主的国际旅客，当然要用国际标准来选择，来评判。诸如你的旅游方式、旅游路线、旅游项目、旅游服务，人家都要用国际水平来衡量比较。所以，旅游行业要求自己的标准，不是我比过去提高了多少，而是我比国际先进水平如何。这样，才能在国际市场有竞争力。
    “旅游搭台，经贸唱戏”
    １９８８年有个比较引人注目的现象，就是“旅游搭台，经贸唱戏”。一项旅游活动带来几亿元的经贸成交额。这说明旅游业与国民经济有关部门互相依存，互相促进的关系。现在，一座山富裕了一个县，一个湖富裕了一个乡，一个洞富裕了一个村是常有的事。可见，开展商贸旅游，是大有文章可做的。
    不用花钱的服务
    交通梗阻，游客进得来，出不去，一直令人头痛。解决交通问题事关多方，不能一蹴而就。但是有些事情并不是需要花钱才能做到的。如国务院定下的国际旅游者优先的原则，贯彻得如何？这里不含丝毫轻视国内旅客之意，而是出于创汇的需要，也是一种礼让。此其一。其二，国内航班经常误点，有的误点时间很长。总该表示一下歉意吧，必要时总该妥善安排误点旅客的食宿吧？可惜，有的机场不理不睬，态度冷漠，不能不使旅客恼火。
