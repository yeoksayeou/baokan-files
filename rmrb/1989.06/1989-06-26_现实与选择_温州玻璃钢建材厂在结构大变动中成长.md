In 1988, the Wenzhou Fiberglass Building Materials Factory was once again hit by macroeconomic tightening, with nearly 10 million yuan in business contracts falling through.

Some people predicted: "This time, the Wenzhou Fiberglass Building Materials Factory will be completely 'bankrupted'." At multiple meetings of the factory's leadership, Teng Zengshou—this outstanding provincial director, national building materials industry labor model, and senior economist—told his colleagues: "This year, the difficulties are great. After the macro-control, the construction of buildings and halls has been reduced by about 90%, and many contracts have been canceled. The difficulties are a test for our leadership. Difficulties are pressure, but they are also motivation. We have the determination to overcome all kinds of difficulties and achieve better results than in previous years."

While directing the entire factory to fully develop high-end sanitary ware, Teng Zengshou was also adjusting the factory's product structure.

Turning decisions into reality is not an easy task. Take, for example, the integrated train toilet. The factory first had to spend 167,000 yuan in research and development costs to exchange for 2,000 yuan in sales revenue. If it failed, the tens of millions of yuan would be wasted! As of now, the factory's series of fiberglass train products has secured over 10 million yuan in business contracts, with an estimated total output value of 10 to 20 million yuan for 1989. At the same time, the Wenzhou Fiberglass Building Materials Factory has successively developed and successfully produced a series of new fiberglass products, including export "four-star" luxury toilets, "Tatola" heavy-duty truck integrated driver's cabs (replacing imported projects), Beijing "Cherokee" new type of jeep seats, domestically produced minibus integrated car bodies, export 64 cubic meter large integrated swimming pools (matched with foreign yachts), and more. Among these, the "four-star" luxury toilets and integrated train toilet compartments are listed as national-level new product development projects, and the underwater dredging dual-purpose motorboat and 7-meter workboat are designated products for the National Fisheries Bureau and the Navy Equipment Department, respectively.

Last year, the factory also designated an area within the factory to attract social talent, capital, and technology, establishing a shareholding enterprise—the Wenzhou Dongfang Industrial Complete Equipment Company. They developed nine new products, including multifunctional travel knives, numbered safety locks, motorcycle helmets, teaching chalk pens, a series of export antennas, and pressure vessels, with an investment of only 200,000 yuan and 8 months of time, achieving a production value of 3.27 million yuan and creating a tax profit of 370,000 yuan.

A new dilemma has fallen upon the Wenzhou Fiberglass Building Materials Factory: the development of ship products requires funds, technology, equipment, facilities, and talent, all of which are in short supply.

Teng Zengshou saw a major trend: the practice of economic development calls for the flow, transfer, and re-combination of asset and resource stocks. As an enterprise, merely paying attention to the accumulation rate and investment rate in investment decisions is far from enough. One must also pay attention to fully utilizing existing asset and resource stocks and improving their utilization efficiency to make up for the lack of "hardware." Based on this new way of thinking, Teng Zengshou chose the investment decision to merge other people's asset and resource stocks. The New Hua Shipyard, located just a stone's throw away from the factory, had stopped production due to losses and became the target of the Wenzhou Fiberglass Building Materials Factory's merger. The Wenzhou Fiberglass Building Materials Factory, on the one hand, injected the "living water" of internal reform and management mechanisms into the gasping New Hua Shipyard, and on the other hand, flowed and transferred the asset and resource stocks of the New Hua Shipyard to the factory, optimizing their combination with the factory's assets and resources and investing them into the effective supply mechanism. In just three months, they successively resumed work on the 1,000-ton special vehicle transport ship, two 500-cubic-meter dredging barges, and a 400-passenger yacht that had been halted, and sent them down the water, with work efficiency exceeding the original by three times.

The Wenzhou Fiberglass Building Materials Factory originally had no wharf, no shipyard, no berthing technical force or equipment, and did not have the basic conditions for shipbuilding. After the merger, the situation changed dramatically. The Wenzhou Fiberglass Building Materials Factory immediately matched the ship and boat production line with the New Hua Shipyard, utilizing the existing shipbuilding facilities, equipment, and technical forces to directly invest in the production of fiberglass ships and boats, greatly improving work efficiency and significantly reducing costs.

　　现实与选择    
    ——温州玻璃钢建材厂在结构大变动中成长
    张和平
    １９８８年，玻璃钢建材厂再次受到宏观紧缩的冲击，近千万元业务额泡了汤。
    有人料定：这回玻璃钢建材厂要彻底“倒摊儿”了。在厂领导班子多次会议上，滕增寿——这位省优秀厂长、全国建材行业劳模、高级经济师对同行们说：“今年困难很大，宏观控制后楼堂馆所压缩了９０％左右，取消的合同甚多。困难对我们领导班子是个考验。困难是压力，但也是动力，我们有决心克服种种困难，取得比往年更好的成效。”
    滕增寿在指挥全厂全力开发豪华型卫生洁具的同时，也进行着企业产品结构的调整。
    将决策转为现实，决非一件易事。且说火车整体卫生间，厂方先得花１６．７万元的研制开发费去换２０００来元的销售额，如果搞砸了，那十几万元的巨资就打了水漂漂！到目前止，该厂的火车玻璃钢系列制品已定下１０００多万元的业务额，预计１９８９年这一项业务的总产值可达一二千万元。同时，玻璃钢建材厂还相继研制开发成功了出口的“四星级”豪华型卫生间、“太脱拉”重型汽车整体型驾驶室（取代引进项目）、北京“切诺基”新型吉普车座椅、国产面包车整体型车壳、出口的６４立方米大型整体游泳池（与国外游船配套）等一系列玻璃钢新产品。其中“四星级”豪华型卫生间和整体式火车厢卫生间列为国家级新产品开发项目，水下清淤两用机动船与７米工作艇分别被定为国家水产局和海军装备部的定点产品。
    去年，该厂还在厂内划出一块“领域”，吸引社会的人才、资金、技术，构建股份化企业——温州东方工业成套设备公司，开发多功能旅游刀、号码保险锁、摩托车头盔、教棒原珠笔、系列出口天线、压力容器等９个新产品，仅以２０万元投入，花８个月时间，实现产值３２７万元，创税利３７万元。
    一个新的困境，又落在温州玻璃钢建材厂的眼前：开发船艇产品所需的资金、技术、设备、设施、人才等全都紧缺、匮乏。
    滕增寿看到了这样一个大趋势：经济发展的实践，召唤着资产、资源存量的流动、转移和重新组合。作为一个企业，在投资决策中仅仅注意自身积累率和投资率的高低是远远不够，还必须注意充分利用已有的资产、资源存量，提高它的利用效率，来填补“硬件”的不足。根据这样的新思维，滕增寿选择了兼并他人资产、资源存量的投资决策。离该厂仅一箭之遥的新华造船厂因亏损停产，成了温州玻璃钢建材厂的兼并对象。玻璃钢建材厂一方面将本厂内部改革和管理机制的“活水”输入气息奄奄的新华造纸厂，另一方面，又将新华造船厂的资产、资源存量流动、转移到本厂，并与本厂的资产、资源优化组合，将之投入有效供给的机体中。他们仅花３个月的时间，相继把已停工待造的１０００吨特种车辆运输船、两艘排泥量为５００立方的坭驳、４００个客位的游轮复工后送下水，工效超出原来３倍。
    玻璃钢建材厂原来一无码头，二无船坞，三无泊装技术力量与设备，不具备起码的造船条件。一兼并，情况起了大变化。玻璃钢建材厂立即将船、艇制造的生产线与新华造船厂配套，利用现成的造船设施、设备、技术力量直接投入玻璃钢船、艇的生产，工效大大提高，成本大大节省。
