Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 15th.

Wan Li, Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, visited Capital Steel today to meet with the workers. He praised the Capital Steel workers for passing a severe test during the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion, for clearly supporting the Party Central Committee's wise decision, and for consciously maintaining production and stability.

At around 10 a.m., Chairman Wan Li arrived at the Chrysanthemum Garden Hall of Capital Steel. Over the past decade, Chairman Wan Li has always cared for Capital Steel. He said, "During the rebellion, Capital Steel passed a severe test. While I was abroad, I heard foreign news reports saying that 70,000 people at Capital Steel went on strike. I didn't believe it. After returning, I asked Comrade Chen Xitong of Beijing Municipality: How did Capital Steel perform during the rebellion? He said, 'Very well.' Then I was reassured."

The leadership of Capital Steel, Zhou Guanwu, reported that during the turmoil, many thugs and members of the Flying Tigers attempted to storm the factory multiple times. Often, people would hold up banners and megaphones at the factory gate, calling for Capital Steel workers to come out and support them, saying, "Don't be indifferent." However, the workers of Capital Steel remained steadfast. Due to traffic disruptions, some workers walked for seven or eight hours to get to work; some colleagues even picked up distant workers to stay at their homes. Some worked continuously for three or four shifts without leaving their posts. Production in May was even better than in the first four months. The cumulative profit for the first five months was 74,257 million yuan, an increase of 22.4% over the same period last year.

Comrade Wan Li happily said, "These workers should be commended. Capital Steel is undergoing both economic and political system reforms. Reform has enhanced the workers' sense of ownership, strengthened organizational discipline, and raised awareness of unity and struggle. Your leadership team is very cohesive, which is the result of reform. Your enterprise's reform has not only passed the test of profits increasing by 20% consecutively for 10 years but also, without national investment, the steel output from 1978 to 1988 doubled and a half; you have also passed the test of political turmoil, proving that you are a model of large enterprise reform."

He said, "Capital Steel has both reform and strong party building and political thought work. Your implementation of the contract system is very good. The contract system, especially the persistence of the workers' congress system, solves the problem of the working class being masters of their own house, truly reflecting the status of workers as masters. The transparency from top to bottom is very high." Wan Li said, you should seriously summarize the successful experiences of ten years of reform and continue to push reform forward. You started reform the earliest, and as a large enterprise, you have the most say. Some people want to blow away reform with a single gust of wind or take a step back, which is not acceptable. You should clearly say: 'Without reform and opening up, China has no way out.'"

Finally, Chairman Wan Li asked the workers how they were and said, "Thank you to all the workers of Capital Steel! I hope you will continue to advance in deepening reform and make greater contributions to building Capital Steel into a large-scale socialist enterprise with Chinese characteristics."

　　万里到首钢看望广大职工
    新华社北京６月１５日电  全国人大常委会委员长万里今天到首钢看望广大职工。他称赞首钢职工在平息反革命暴乱中，经受了严峻的考验，旗帜鲜明地拥护党中央的英明决策，自觉地坚持生产，维护安定团结。
    上午１０时许，万里委员长来到首钢月季园大厅。近十年来，万里委员长一直关怀着首钢。他说：“在暴乱中，首钢经受了严峻的考验。我在国外访问时，听到外电报道，首钢有７万人罢工。我不相信。回来后，问北京市陈希同同志：在暴乱中，首钢表现怎么样？他说，很好。我就放心了。”
    首钢公司领导人周冠五汇报说，动乱时，很多歹徒和飞虎队几次向工厂内冲击，经常有些人举着横幅、标语，拿着大喇叭在厂门口呼叫：首钢人赶快出来声援我们，你们不要麻木不仁了。但首钢广大职工纹丝不动。由于交通受阻，有的职工步行七、八个小时，坚持上班；有的同志把路途远的职工接到自己家中住。有的同志连上三、四个班不下岗。５月份生产比１—４月还好。头５个月累计完成利润７４２５７万元，比去年同期增长２２．４％。
    万里同志高兴地说：“对这些工人应好好地表扬一下。首钢是经济体制改革和政治体制改革双轨进行的。改革提高了工人阶级的主人翁地位，增强了组织纪律性和团结战斗的觉悟。你们领导班子团结得很好，有凝聚力，这是改革的结果。你们企业的改革不仅经过了利润连续１０年递增２０％的考验，在国家没有投资的情况下，钢材产量从１９７８年到１９８８年翻了一番半；你们还经受了政治大动乱的考验，事实证明你们是大企业改革的典范。”
    他说：“首钢一个是改革，一个是党的建设、政治思想工作都抓得很紧。你们实行承包制，我认为你们的办法很好。承包制，特别是坚持了职工代表大会制度，解决了工人阶级当家作主的问题，真正体现了工人主人翁的地位，上下透明度很高。”万里说，你们要认真总结十年改革的成功经验，把改革继续向前推进。你们改革最早，你们作为大企业是最有发言权的。有的人想把改革一风吹，或走回头路，都是不行的。你们要旗帜鲜明地说：“不改革开放中国就没有出路。”最后，万里委员长问职工们好，并说：“感谢首钢全体职工！希望你们在深化改革中继续前进，为把首钢建设成具有中国特色的社会主义大型企业做出更大贡献。”
