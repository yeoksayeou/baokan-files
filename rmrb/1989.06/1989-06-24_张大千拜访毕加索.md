In June 1956, Zhang Daqian held a successful art exhibition at the Louvre Museum in Paris. After the exhibition ended, on July 28, Picasso joyfully received Zhang Daqian at his private villa. The meeting of these two great masters from the East and West attracted worldwide attention in the art world.

The world-renowned Picasso had a very eccentric personality and generally did not receive visitors. Therefore, some people referred to Picasso's villa as the "modern-day castle."

The two masters hit it off immediately, enthusiastically discussing past and present events and exploring artistic issues together. Picasso was very interested in Zhang Daqian's recent paintings, carefully examining each one. Picasso had always been fond of Chinese ink paintings, and after directly conversing with Zhang Daqian, his interest in Chinese ink paintings deepened. From then on, he often painted in the Chinese style.

Picasso was delighted with Zhang Daqian's visit and invited him to stay for lunch to have more time for conversation. After lunch, Zhang Daqian and his wife, accompanied by Picasso, toured the studio and the artistically rich garden, and took a commemorative photo together.

During their meeting, the two artistic giants were inspired to create art. Zhang Daqian painted a bamboo in ink, and Picasso drew a deity figure. After signing and inscribing their names, they exchanged these pieces as cherished mementos.

　　张大千拜访毕加索
    １９５６年６月，张大千在巴黎卢浮宫博物馆举办画展获得成功。画展结束后，７月２８日，毕加索在他的私人别墅，高兴地接待了张大千。东西方两位大师的会晤，引起了世界画坛的注目。
    名震世界的毕加索，脾气十分古怪，一般是不接待来访者的，因此，有人把毕加索居住的别墅称之为“当代古堡”。
    两位大师一见如故，兴致勃勃地谈古论今，一起探讨艺术问题。毕加索对张大千带去的近期绘画作品颇感兴趣，一张接着一张，看得很仔细。毕加索本来对中国水墨画就很喜欢，通过和张大千直接交谈，他对中国水墨画的兴趣就更浓了，从此以后常作中国画。
    毕加索对张大千的来访很高兴，要留大千共进午餐，以便有更多的时间进行交谈。午餐后，张大千夫妇又在毕加索的陪同下，参观了画室和充满艺术气息的花园，并合影留念。
    二位艺术大师在会晤中，画兴勃发，便各自用自己常用的绘画工具各作了一幅画。张大千画了一幅墨竹，毕加索画了一张神像，签名题款后，作为美好的纪念物相互交换。
