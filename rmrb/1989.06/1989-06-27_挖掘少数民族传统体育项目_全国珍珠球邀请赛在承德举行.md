To further explore traditional sports of China's ethnic minorities, promote the development of ethnic sports, and enhance unity and friendship among ethnic groups, the National Pearl Ball Invitational was recently held in Chengde, a famous summer resort in northern China.

Pearl Ball is a traditional sport of the Manchu ethnic group, resembling both basketball and handball. Pearl Ball, also known as "Picking Pearls," originated from the Manchu people's imitation of pearl picking and was once popular in the Northeast, Hebei, Beijing, Tianjin, and other regions. The opposing teams use an embroidered ball to symbolize large pearls, which are thrown from a basket, signifying that the thrower can collect more pearls in the future. The current competition ball is a round rubber ball. Scoring team members hold a net bag to catch the ball and can move around within the scoring area. Outside the scoring area is the defense zone, where two defenders from the opposing team use shell-shaped paddles to block the other team from obtaining the "pearls." Each match involves two teams, with six players on each team. The sport is intense, fast-paced, and requires athletes to have strong physiques, excellent skills, and good teamwork.

This National Pearl Ball Invitational attracted 26 teams from eight provinces and municipalities, including Liaoning, Jilin, Heilongjiang, Hebei, Shandong, and Beijing. The scale of this event is unprecedented in the history of national ethnic minority single-sport events. The Fengning Manchu Autonomous County Performing Troupe also performed "Manchu Grand Dance" and other culturally rich performances at the opening ceremony.

    全国珍珠球邀请赛在承德举行
    本报讯  据新华社报道：为进一步挖掘我国少数民族的传统体育项目，促进民族体育事业的发展，增进各民族的团结和友谊，全国珍珠球邀请赛日前在塞外避暑胜地承德举行。
    珍珠球是我国满族的一个传统体育项目，既似篮球又似手球。珍珠球又称采珍珠，是满族先人模仿采珍珠的劳动演化而来，曾广泛流行于东三省、河北、北京、天津等地。对抗双方以绣球象征着大颗珍珠，从海篓中抛甩，预示着抛中者未来可采集到更多的珍珠。而目前的比赛用球采用圆形橡胶球，得分区队员持有带网兜的抄网，可以在区内来回移动接球。得分区外是封锁区，由对方两名防守队员手持贝壳状的球拍，阻止对方获得“珍珠”。每场比赛由两个队参加，每队出场６人，其对抗性强、速度快、要求运动员有强壮的体魄、高超的技艺及良好的集体配合。
    参加这次全国珍珠球邀请赛的有来自辽宁、吉林、黑龙江、河北、山东、北京等８个省市的２６个代表队，其规模之大，在全国少数民族单项体育史上还是首次。丰宁满族自治县演出团还在开幕式上表演了“满族大秧歌”等富有民族特色的节目。
