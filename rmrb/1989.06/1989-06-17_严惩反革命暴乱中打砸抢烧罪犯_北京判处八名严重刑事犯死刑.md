Today, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court publicly sentenced a group of serious criminal offenders who committed arson, looting, and violence during the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing. The arsonists Lin Zhaohong, Chen Jian, Zu Jianjun, Wang Lianxi, Wang Hanwu, and Zhang Wenkuai, along with the looter Luo Hongjun and the hooligan Ban Huijie, were all sentenced to death and deprivation of political rights for life in the first instance.

Lin Zhaohong, a worker at the Beijing Hui People's Hospital, was previously subjected to three years of forced labor for hooliganism. During the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, at around 1 a.m. on June 5, 1989, he sneaked into the martial law-imposed area near the right gate of the Yongdingmen Bridge in Fengtai District, Beijing, and set fire to a military transport vehicle, destroying it, and stole seven military uniforms from the vehicle. Luo Hongjun, a ringleader of the mob involved in looting and arson, was a ticket seller at the Beijing Public Transportation Company. He was previously administratively detained for assaulting others. At around 8 a.m. on June 4, 1989, Luo, riding a tricycle, sneaked into the martial law-imposed area near the right gate of the Yongdingmen Bridge in Xuanwu District, Beijing, and jumped onto a military vehicle carrying military supplies that was obstructed from entering the city. He threw military uniforms, blankets, and compressed biscuits from the vehicle onto the ground, shouting and inciting the crowd to smash and loot. He also wielded a kitchen knife, slashing and hacking on the vehicle. Under Luo's incitement, a large amount of military supplies were looted. Luo took the opportunity to steal a large quantity of military supplies, including military blankets, mosquito nets, raincoats, uniforms, caps, military rubber-soled shoes, instant noodles, compressed biscuits, audio tapes, and more.

Ban Huijie, a farmer from Xingle County, Hebei Province, took advantage of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing while working as a contract worker in the city. At around 8 p.m. on June 3, 1989, he sneaked into the martial law-imposed area near the west gate of the Taoranting Swimming Pool in Xuanwu District, Beijing. Seeing that soldiers from the 52408 unit of the People's Liberation Army, who were on duty for martial law, were passing by, he joined some rioters in chasing and verbally abusing the soldiers and beating them. Ban threw bricks at the soldiers and wielded a leather belt with a metal buckle, viciously whipping multiple soldiers on the head, face, chest, and back. Ban also joined a group of rioters in brutally beating soldier Yue Haishen, leaving him unconscious on the ground with a through-and-through injury on his right lower jaw and a fractured right lower jawbone. Ban also joined a group of rioters in intercepting soldier Wen Lianglei and viciously whipping him on the chest and back with the metal buckle of the leather belt.

These criminals include local farmers, workers, and unemployed individuals, as well as outsiders or farmers who had fled to Beijing. Many of them had been previously punished for various illegal activities or had fled to Beijing after committing crimes. During the counter-revolutionary riot, they brazenly set fire to military vehicles and public buses, viciously attacked and injured soldiers on duty with martial law enforcement, and led mobs in looting military supplies. They collectively burned six military vehicles and public buses, injured multiple soldiers, and stole a large amount of military supplies. Their criminal acts were extremely flagrant, with particularly severe circumstances and consequences, posing a significant threat.

To severely suppress the counter-revolutionary riot and severely crack down on serious criminal offenders during the riot, the Beijing Municipal Intermediate People's Court sentenced the aforementioned eight criminals to death in the first instance. Lin Zhaohong and the other criminals appealed to the Beijing Municipal Higher People's Court.

　　严惩反革命暴乱中打砸抢烧罪犯
    北京判处八名严重刑事犯死刑
    新华社北京六月十七日电  今天，北京市中级人民法院公开判处一批在北京发生的反革命暴乱期间进行打砸抢烧的严重刑事犯罪分子。放火犯林昭荣、陈坚、祖建军、王连禧、王汉武、张文奎，抢劫犯罗红军、流氓犯班会杰等八名罪犯，一审被判处死刑、剥夺政治权利终身。
    北京市回民医院工人林昭荣，曾因流氓行为被强制劳动三年，在北京发生反革命暴乱期间，于一九八九年六月五日凌晨一时许窜到已戒严的北京市丰台区右安门大桥附近，将戒严部队的运输车放火烧毁，并抢走车上的军衣七件。聚众打砸抢的首要分子、抢劫犯罗红军是北京市公共汽车总公司的售票员，曾因殴打他人被行政拘留。一九八九年六月四日上午八时许，罗犯骑着平板三轮车窜到已实行戒严的北京宣武区右安门大桥附近，跳上一辆进城受阻的解放军戒严部队装有军用物资的军车，将汽车上的军衣、军被及压缩饼干等物资往车下乱扔，向围堵军车的人狂喊乱叫，煽动砸抢，并手持菜刀在汽车上乱砍乱剁。在罗犯的煽动下，大量军用物资被洗劫一空。罗犯趁机将军车上装载的军用棉被、蚊帐、雨衣、军服、军帽、军用胶布鞋、方便面、压缩饼干、录音磁带等大量物品抢走。河北省新乐县农民班会杰，在北京做合同工期间，乘北京发生反革命暴乱之机，于一九八九年六月三日晚八时许，窜至已实行戒严的宣武区陶然亭游泳场西门附近，见执行戒严任务的中国人民解放军五二四○八部队的部分官兵正在行进，即伙同一些暴徒追赶战士进行谩骂和围打。班会杰向战士投掷砖头，并手持一条武装皮带，紧随部队用皮带铁头向多名战士的头部、脸部、胸部、背部等处凶狠抽打。班犯又伙同一伙暴徒围住战士岳海银进行残酷殴打，将岳海银打昏在地，右下颌面部形成贯通伤，右下颌骨骨折。班犯还伙同一伙暴徒将解放军战士温良磊截住，用武装带铁头部狠抽这位战士的胸、背部。
    这批罪犯有的是本市农民、工人和无业人员，有的是外地流窜犯或农民，其中有多人因各种违法行为被处理过，或因犯罪潜逃来京。他们在反革命暴乱中，猖狂放火焚烧军车和公共汽车，穷凶极恶地持械殴打、残害执行戒严任务的部队官兵，聚众为首抢劫军用物资。他们共烧毁军车和公共汽车六辆，打伤解放军官兵多人，抢走大量军用物资，犯罪气焰极为嚣张，情节和后果特别严重，危害极大。
    为了严厉镇压反革命暴乱，严厉打击在反革命暴乱中的严重刑事犯罪分子，北京市中级人民法院一审判处上述八名罪犯死刑。林昭荣等罪犯不服，向北京市高级人民法院提出上诉。
