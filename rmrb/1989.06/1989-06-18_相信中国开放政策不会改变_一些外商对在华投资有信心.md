	Some foreign investors express confidence in investing in China.

	According to reports from Xinhua News Agency's correspondents, some foreign investors have recently expressed confidence in investing in China.

	Our correspondent Ji Jingru reported from Hangzhou that some overseas clients who had previously requested to postpone business activities in Hangzhou or delay issuing letters of credit have recently called to place orders for goods and request quotations. Some clients have even come to Hangzhou to sign new purchase contracts or remit prepayments.

	From June 5 to 7, Hangzhou Grain, Oil, Livestock, and By-Products Import and Export Company received four letters of credit and remittances from clients in West Germany, Malaysia, and Hong Kong, requesting the shipment of goods totaling $215,500, including mushroom slices, feathers, alcohol, and purple clay teapots. In recent days, business activities at this import and export company have gradually returned to normal.

	Our correspondent Xia Ruge reported from Shanghai that the previously quiet office of the Shanghai Foreign Investment Commission has become busy again. On the morning of June 13, when the reporter visited to listen to staff member Li Guanliang introduce the situation of foreign investment, they were frequently interrupted by people coming to discuss business. Many foreign investors believe that China's policy of opening up to the outside world will not change and that China has the ability to overcome the current difficulties. Some foreign investors have explicitly stated that Shanghai remains their ideal investment location. Recently, the Dutch company Alcatel decided to establish a joint venture with Shanghai, "Shanghai Alcatel Communication Equipment Co., Ltd.," and held a signing ceremony in Shanghai. The boss of the Canadian Hamilton John Engineering Co., Ltd., Yao Cheng, came to Shanghai to discuss a joint venture project for tire retreading. He was recalled by the company's board of directors midway through the process and instructed to cancel the investment in Shanghai. However, he argued his case, and the board of directors had to decide to use his personal assets as collateral to invest in Shanghai. Yao Cheng explained these circumstances in a recent letter, expressing his wish that it would be realized soon. The representative of the American Wanxiang United Company, who left Shanghai midway, recently wrote a letter praising Shanghai's sincerity towards joint ventures. They expressed that they would soon return to Shanghai to continue discussing business. Several large companies from West Germany, Australia, the United States, and Japan, which have already invested in and established joint ventures in Shanghai, have directly expressed to Mayor Zhu Rongji that they will continue to invest in Shanghai.

	According to our correspondent He Guanghuai in Shenzhen, during this period, none of the more than 60 Japanese-funded enterprises in Shenzhen have withdrawn their personnel. Some Japanese businessmen have expressed that their confidence in investing in Shenzhen has not wavered. Local economic circles pointed out that Japan has become one of the most important sources of foreign investment in Shenzhen, with Japanese businesses involved in real estate, electronics, machinery, food, printing, chemicals, fisheries, and apparel. Most Japanese-funded enterprises have achieved good economic results. The Japanese Seiko Group, after an on-site investigation, concluded that the comprehensive cost of setting up a factory in Shenzhen is one-third lower than that of similar factories in Japan, and moreover, the quality of Chinese labor is quite good.

　　相信中国开放政策不会改变
    一些外商对在华投资有信心
    据新华社北京６月１８日电  综合本社记者发来的报道，最近一些外商表示对在中国投资有信心。
    本社记者纪静如从杭州发来的报道说，前些日子曾要求推迟来杭进行商务活动或延缓开具信用证的有些海外客商，近几天又来电订购商品、要求报价；有的客商还来杭签订新的购货合同或汇来预付款。
    杭州市粮油土畜产进出口公司从６月５日至７日收到了联邦德国、马来西亚和香港等地的客商寄来的４份信用证及汇款，要求发去蘑菇片、羽毛、酒、紫砂壶等总值２１．５５万美元的商品。几天来，这家进出口公司商务活动渐趋正常。
    本社记者夏儒阁从上海发来的报道说，一度冷清的上海外国投资工作委员会的办公室，现在又重新热闹起来。６月１３日上午，当记者到这里听取工作人员李关良介绍外商投资情况时，经常被前来联系业务的人打断。不少外商表示相信中国对外开放的方针不会变，而且有能力渡过当前的难关。有的外商明确表示，上海仍然是他们理想的投资场所。最近荷兰光纤公司决定与上海合资成立“上海爱梯恩梯通信设备有限公司”，并在沪举行了签字仪式。加拿大汉密尔顿约翰工程有限公司老板姚诚来沪洽谈轮胎翻新合资项目，中途被公司董事会调回，让他取消向上海投资。但他据理力争，董事会只好作出决定，以他个人财产作抵押向上海投资。姚诚在最近的来信中说明了这些情况，表示他的愿望一定会很快实现。中途离沪的美国万象联合公司代表，最近也来信称赞上海对合资的诚意，他们表示不久便来沪继续洽谈生意。联邦德国、澳大利亚、美国、日本等已经在上海投资办了合资企业的几家大公司，目前还直接向朱熔基市长表示，继续向上海投资。
    据本社驻深圳记者何广怀报道，这段时间，在深圳的６０多家日资企业没有一家把人员撤走。一些日本客商表示，他们没有动摇对深圳的投资信心。此间经济界人士指出，日本目前已成为深圳最重要的外资来源之一，地产、电子、机械、食品、印刷、化工、渔业、服装等行业均有日商涉及，大部分日资企业都取得了良好的经济效益。日本精工集团实地调查后认为，在深圳投资办厂的综合成本要比日本同类厂低１／３，而且，中国劳动力素质相当好。
