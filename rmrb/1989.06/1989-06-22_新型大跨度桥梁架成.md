A new large-span bridge employing a non-standard steel truss structure with bolted and welded connections was successfully assembled and closed on June 18 in Fujian Province's Minjiang Double Tower Railway Bridge. Its successful construction provides new experience for building large-span under-deck steel truss bridges in China.

The bridge, with a total length of 773 meters and a central span of 108 meters, is currently the largest span of a continuous under-deck bolted and welded truss structure in China. It was constructed using the "divide and conquer" method, where the structure is broken down into smaller sections, assembled piece by piece, and then suspended and joined together in one successful installation.

    本报讯  国内首次采用的大跨度非标准钢桁梁栓焊结构，６月１８日在福建闽江双塔铁路桥顺利悬拼合拢。它的架设成功，为我国修建大跨度下承式钢桁梁桥提供了新的经验。
    这座特大桥全长７７３米，中部跨度１０８米，为我国目前最大跨度的连续下承式栓焊桁梁结构，是采用“化整为零，节节组装”的悬拼架设方法，一次架设成功的。
