A year and a half ago, a reporter entered a public toilet near the offices of the Hubei Provincial Committee and Government in Wuchang, Wuhan. However, after just a few seconds, the reporter rushed out. The place was overflowing with excrement and urine, flies and maggots were swarming, and the stench was suffocating. A nearby resident said, "I've been to Beijing's public toilets, and compared to ours in Wuhan, they're like heaven and earth!"

This remark made the managers of Beijing's public toilets feel quite ashamed. Xue Baoyi, director of the Beijing Municipal Sanitation Bureau, told the reporter: "In reality, more than 80% of Beijing's public toilets can be found by following one's nose, and when approaching, one needs to cover their nose to pass by. It's better in the city, but in the urban-rural fringe areas and suburbs, there are still many toilets in the same condition as 'Wuchang Fruit Lake'."

A foreign visitor who had experienced the hardships wrote an account of using a toilet on the way to the Badaling Great Wall. He summarized his experience in four steps: "Cry" - unable to find a toilet along the way, already desperate, but seeing the toilet still requires waiting in line, crying in frustration; "Laugh" - people in the toilet are together without any cover, looking at each other is quite funny; "Shout" - a moment of inattention and a large maggot crawls onto your foot, screaming in fright; "Jump" - the ground inside is covered with piles of excrement, making it difficult to step down, so one has to jump around. Therefore, some foreign visitors, to avoid embarrassment, proposed activity plans such as "visiting the Forbidden City and using the toilet at the Beijing Hotel" and "visiting Shougang and returning to the Fragrant Hills Hotel to find a toilet."

On December 2, 1986, Pak Tung-kwok, who came to Beijing to participate in the drafting of the Basic Law of Hong Kong, reported to General Secretary Hu Yaobang: "I got off the plane at the Capital Airport and smelled the stench as I approached the toilet. My nine dragons have a lot of people, with more than 100 public toilets, none of which have any smell, and they all have toilet paper. I'm talking about management, and I'll go for a walk whenever I have time."

On January 20, 1989, Song Jian, the director of the State Science and Technology Commission, wrote a letter to Beijing Mayor Chen Xitong and Vice Mayor Wu Yi: "...Foreigners almost complain every day that China's toilets are too dirty. Since 1984, I have heard countless times in the State Council meetings about this problem. However, we have no solution, it's too humiliating. I suggest: we jointly launch a campaign to clean up the toilets! Beijing can lead this trend, and the whole country will follow. Beijing already has a number of relatively good toilets, with a considerable foundation.... The key is to have practical methods, and I suggest that the environmental protection, science and technology, and health departments work together, for two years. If we can't even change this bad habit, what modern civilization are we talking about! Please consider, the Science and Technology Commission is willing to contribute to this, and to accompany you to the end."

A few days ago, a resident from Dabeiwao called the office of the Beijing Vice Mayor: "This morning, I was attacked by 3 big rats in the public toilet, and my buttocks were bitten. Are you going to do something about it?" What can the vice mayor say? Apart from consolation and expressing regret, he can only assure the resident that the public toilets will be improved as soon as possible.

Currently, Beijing has a total of 57,800 public toilets. Among them, 50,000 are managed by units, 1,000 are managed by tourist attractions and large public venues, and 6,800 are managed by the sanitation system. This is indeed a lot for the vice mayor to handle.

In the past five years, Beijing has invested a lot of effort in the construction of public toilets. An investment of 20 million yuan was made to build and renovate 1,300 toilets and to renovate 1,000 overflowing septic tanks with sewer connections, and the previously serious leakage problems have been basically solved. Recently, McCauley, the deputy director of the Beijing Municipal Sanitation Bureau, took the reporter to see several public toilets in Beijing.

The first place: Located next to the west gate of the History Museum at Tiananmen Square. It is a semi-underground facility covering an area of more than 300 square meters. The rest area has a fake mountain, a fountain, goldfish swimming, flowers, sofas, and soothing music. The floor and the PVC plastic board separated toilets are polished and shiny. Naturally, there is no smell here. The comment book has many praises for the service and hygiene here, with some writing: "Entering once costs 3 jiao, it's worth it." But 12% of the commenters think that using such a toilet is "beyond their financial means." This "luxury" type of public toilet, currently Beijing has 40, all located at tourist attractions.

The second place: Located on the west side of the south gate of Zhongshan Park, it is the toilet that the Wuhan resident praised at the beginning of this article. Since March last year, it has been operated by Liu Zhaomin, a 61-year-old retired team leader of the West City Sanitation Team 5, and his wife. The toilet is clean and tidy, with sewing and other free services outside. Previously, this toilet lost 250,000 yuan a year, and both the public and the managers complained. Now, with a charge of 3 jiao (seniors, the disabled, and students are not charged), not only are some minor repairs and service facilities added and the management fees no longer a burden on the state, but the couple also earns 800 to 900 yuan a month. There are currently 17 such toilets in Beijing.

The third place: Located under the Xizhimen overpass. It uses a new invention from the Fourth Planning and Design Research Institute of the Aerospace Department, which has applied for a patent - an automatic flushing and water circulation treatment device. This system, which can achieve unmanned management, uses treated circulating sewage to flush the toilet, uses tap water to flush the urinal and wash hands, saves electricity, and saves 90% of water, which is very environmentally friendly. The renovation cost only 147,000 yuan, and it has been in use for more than seven months. It is estimated that the entire investment can be recovered in one year. There are currently 23 such toilets in Beijing, and the city plans to renovate more than 20 this year.

Xue Baoyi believes that the main problem with Beijing's public toilets is "two shortages and two lows." That is, there is a shortage of places to build toilets and a shortage of funds to build and manage toilets; the vast majority of toilets are built to a low standard, and the vast majority of toilets are managed to a low level.

The reporter thinks that these "hardware" issues are also related to some "software" issues. This is the modern concept and social ethics.

Chinese eating and drinking are recognized as first-class in the world. Defecation, although also an unavoidable human need, was tabooed by our ancestors, who considered it something unworthy of mention. This traditional concept has been passed down to this day, and at a time when we are calling for "comprehensive modernization," it cannot be mentioned alongside other aspects of life. Therefore, after opening up and reform, a large number of foreigners rushed into China, and as a symbol of human civilization progress, the toilet has made a fool of itself. In addition to serving foreigners in the "window," the toilets for ordinary people should also get out of the predicament of being dirty, smelly, and makeshift, because this is a need for public health and a need for the social health system.

The most headache-inducing are those who destroy public facilities. The newly painted white walls in the toilet are quickly covered with obscene language. When it became plastic and difficult to write on, he would burn it with a lit cigarette. What is baffling is: why does he have to do these things that harm others and do not benefit himself? If people talk more about social ethics, it will increase the confidence of the management personnel to manage the toilets well. The toilet is indeed a window of social civilization.

### 却说北京的公厕

　　却说北京的公厕
    本报记者  艾笑
    　　　　名声在外
    一年多以前，记者走进距湖北省委、省政府办公地不远的武昌水果湖公厕。不料，只几秒钟就逃了出来。因为里面满溢着粪尿，蝇蛆横飞滥爬，臭气让人窒息。一位附近居民说：“我上过北京的公厕，和我们武汉的比，真是天上地下呢！”
    此话倒使北京的公厕管理者着实惭愧。市环卫局薛宝义处长告诉记者：实际上目前北京的公厕，８０％以上可以让人“跟着感觉”找，走近时则需掩鼻而过。市内还好，城乡结合部和郊区的公厕，像“水果湖”那种状况的，也有不少。
    一位曾身受其苦的外宾，写过一篇记述去八达岭途中在滚天沟上厕所的经历。他总结的四步曲是：“哭”——沿途一直找不到厕所，已憋得够呛，但见厕所还得排队等候，急得想哭；“笑”——入厕者共济一堂毫无遮挡，彼此对视十分可笑；“叫”——稍没警惕大尾巴蛆便爬上脚来，吓得大喊大叫；“跳”——厕内地上粪尿东一堆、西一摊，使人难以放心下足，只好跳着走。所以，有的国外来客为避免难堪，提出“在故宫参观到北京饭店上厕所”、“去首钢访问回香山饭店寻方便”的活动计划。
    　　　　内在压力
    １９８６年１２月２日，来京参加香港基本法起草委员会会议的包玉刚先生到总书记胡耀邦那里奏了一本：“我从首都机场下飞机，走近厕所，就闻到臭味。我那个九龙仓，人也特别多，有１００多个公共厕所，没有一个有臭味的，而且都有手纸。我说的是管理，一有空我就去走一走。”
    １９８９年１月２０日，国家科委主任宋健给北京市市长陈希同、副市长吴仪写了封信：“……外国人几乎天天在抱怨中国的厕所太脏。从１９８４年我到科委以后，听到国务院无数次会议上都讲到这个问题。然而，我们却没有办法，太窝囊了。建议：我们共同发起一个运动，把厕所治好！北京先引导一下这个潮流，全国就会跟着学。北京已有了一批较好的厕所，有相当基础。……关键是要有切实的办法，建议由环保、科委、卫生部门联合作战，干它两年。如果连这一点陋习也改不过来，还谈什么现代文明！敬请斟酌，科委愿为此出力，舍命相陪。”
    几天前，一个家住大北窑的居民电话打到北京市副市长的办公桌上：“今天早晨，我在公厕里遭到３只大老鼠的围攻，屁股被咬破。你管不管？”副市长能回答什么？除了慰问和表示抱歉外，只得向这位居民保证，一定尽快整治好公厕。
    目前，全北京市共有公厕５．７８万多个。其中属于单位内部的５万多个，旅游点和大型公共场所管理的１０００多个，环卫系统管理的６８００多个。确实够这位副市长管的。
    　　　　解决有望
    最近这５年，北京在公厕建设上没少花力气。投资２０００万元，新建翻建公厕１３００个、改建通下水道的溢流粪井１０００个，原先较严重的渗漏问题基本都解决了。日前，市环卫局麦绍在副处长领记者看了几处北京的公厕。
    第一处：位于天安门广场历史博物馆西门旁。３００多平方米，半地下式。休息厅里有假山、喷水池，还有游弋的金鱼、鲜花、沙发和悠扬的音乐。地面和ＰＶＣ塑料板隔开的马桶擦得光亮照人。自然，这里没有臭味。留言簿上对这里的服务和卫生状况赞美的很多，有的写着：“进来一次花３角钱，值得。”但有１２％的留言者认为上这样的厕所“财力不够”。这种“豪华”型公厕，目前北京已有４０个，均分布在各旅游景点上。
    第二处：位于中山公园南门西侧，就是本文开头那位武汉居民曾赞扬过的那间。去年３月开始，由６１岁的西城区环卫５队退休队长刘兆民夫妇承包，厕所里清清爽爽，厕所外有针线。开水和存物等免费服务。以前这间厕所每年亏损２．５万元，群众和管理者都怨声载道。现在靠“收费３分”（老弱残和学生不收），不仅一些小修、服务设施的添置和管理费都不用国家操心，老两口每月还有八九百元收入。这种模式的，北京现有１７个。
    第三处：位于西直门立交桥下。它使用了航空航天部第四规划设计研究院一项已申报专利的新发明——自动冲刷水循环处理装置。这套可实现无人管理的系统，用处理过的循环污水冲洗大便器，用自来水冲洗小便器和洗手，省电并节水９０％，极利环保。改建投资仅１．４７万元，现已使用７个多月，预计一年可回收全部投资。像这种样子的，北京市今年要改建二十几个。
    　　　　还缺什么
    薛宝义认为，当前北京公厕的主要问题是“两缺两低”。即缺建公厕的地方，缺建缺管公厕的资金；绝大部分公厕建的标准低，绝大部分公厕管的水平低。
    记者捉摸，他提的这些“硬件”还和一些“软件”有因果关系。这就是现代观念和社会公德。
    中国人的吃喝，世界公认是第一流的。拉撒虽也是人之不可遏制的需要，但我们的祖先却对其忌讳得很，认为那是不登大雅之堂的事。这一传统观念遗传至今，就在到处呼唤“全方位现代化”的时候，也不能和其它生活要素相提并论、配套安排。因此，开放搞活以后，大批外国人涌进中国，作为人类文明进步标志之一的厕所，就出尽了“洋相”。除了为外宾服务的“窗口”，普通百姓的厕所也应当走出脏、臭、凑合的窘境，因为这是公共卫生的需要，是社会大卫生系统的需要。
    最令人头痛的是那些公共设施的破坏者。新刷的厕所内白墙，转眼间涂画了污言秽语。改成塑料的不易涂画了，他就用点着的香烟烧。使人百思不得其解的是：为什么他非要干这些损人不利己的事情？人们多讲些社会公德，就会增加管理人员管好公厕的信心。厕所，确是社会文明的一个窗口。
