A Scene of Inhumanity
The Truth Behind the Murder of Soldier Chui Guozheng at Chongwenmen Overpass

The identity of the soldier who was brutally murdered by counter-revolutionary thugs and then left to hang on the Chongwenmen overpass has been confirmed! He was Chui Guozheng, a soldier in the artillery battalion of a certain unit of the martial law troops.

On June 9, the author interviewed soldiers who witnessed Chui Guozheng's murder. Below is a transcript of their conversation.

Platoon Leader Chu Hui Min: I don't know why some Beijing residents don't believe the truth but instead listen to rumors. Take the incident where our soldier Chui Guozheng was killed, for example. Rumors spread widely on the streets. Some say they saw Chui Guozheng shoot three civilians in a row before being beaten to death by the angry crowd. Others say he shot an old woman who was kneeling on the ground begging him not to shoot, and was then beaten to death by the old woman's son and hung on the overpass. As a witness and participant in the scene, I truly don't know what these rumor-mongers are thinking. I really wish I could give these irresponsible, gossiping people a couple of slaps!

The truth is this: At around 4:30 AM on June 4, we were ordered to Beijing to carry out martial law. When our convoy reached the intersection of Chongwenmen Inner Street and West Street, we encountered a group of thugs and uninformed civilians blocking our way. The two vehicles in front were obstructed and immediately turned around to take a different route, but our vehicle, being a large kitchen truck, got stuck on the curb while trying to turn around. As soon as the engine was turned off, the thugs started attacking with stones, bricks, and soda bottles. Then they swarmed over, tearing off the vehicle's cover, letting the air out of the tires, and pulling out the wires from the engine compartment. A group of thugs armed with iron bars, clubs, Molotov cocktails, bricks, and stones climbed onto the vehicle, beating the soldiers and trying to seize their weapons and ammunition. Several thugs brutally dragged the acting platoon leader Wang Feng and the driver Li Jingmin out of the driver's seat and beat them mercilessly, shouting, "Beat the officer to death!" "Maim the driver so they can't escape!" Li Jingmin was beaten unconscious, foaming at the mouth. The platoon leader had eight or nine wounds on his head and body, with the largest wound on his head being over two inches long. Even so, the thugs were not satisfied and hoisted the unconscious Li Jingmin, shouting, "Soldiers, hand over your weapons and ammunition! We have hostages in our hands!"

Squad Leader Zhang Zhenyu: Seeing the platoon leader covered in blood and our comrades beaten unconscious and kidnapped, I was furious and wanted to open fire to teach these thugs a lesson. But thinking of the order from above not to fire, and to avoid hurting innocent people, we held back and didn't fire a single shot.

Platoon Leader Chu Hui Min: To minimize casualties, I discussed with the platoon leader, who had escaped from the thugs, and decided to abandon the vehicle and break out.

Sergeant Sun Chaoheng: The platoon leader led the way, and I and Sun Fucai supported the platoon leader from the rear. When we 11 people broke out to a pedestrian overpass, we were all shocked by the scene before us: A group of thugs had somehow brought three women in their fifties and sixties, pushing and shoving them towards us (Platoon Leader: The thugs knew we couldn't shoot at the people, so they used them as human shields). The three unwilling women walked and shouted, "Children, don't shoot!" When they were about to reach us, the women were pushed to their knees by the thugs. Seeing this, the platoon leader, the platoon leader, and I rushed forward and knelt down to support the three elderly women. The platoon leader said to them as he helped them up, "You are all like our mothers, how could we shoot at you! Please go back, don't be fooled by the bad people!" Just then, the thugs took advantage of our helping the elderly women and attacked us with fists and clubs, knocking Chui Guozheng unconscious and dragging him away. At this moment, a man in his forties warned us not to persist any longer, saying that these people had gone mad and that we might all die in their hands. He then voluntarily led us to the wall outside the National Defense Science and Technology Commission Guesthouse. At that time, a young man handed over an assault rifle, saying, "Your comrade was badly beaten, you'd better jump over the wall quickly. This gun belonged to the beaten soldier and was taken back from a thug by me." After entering the courtyard, we immediately received warm care and careful treatment from the guesthouse staff.

Platoon Leader Chu Hui Min: Later, a witness who saw Chui Guozheng's tragic death told me that after he was beaten unconscious, several thugs lifted him up and threw him off the overpass. At that time, the unconscious Chui Guozheng still had some awareness and was writhing on the ground in pain. Seeing this, some thugs laughed wildly, while others ran to the bottom of the bridge and poured gasoline all over Chui Guozheng's body and set it on fire, burning him alive. Even then, the vicious thugs were not satisfied and found a rope to hang Chui Guozheng's charred body for display. You can imagine how miserable Chui Guozheng's death was!

To this day, the whereabouts of the driver Li Jingmin are still unknown, and his life is in danger.

　　灭绝人性的一幕
    战士崔国政在崇文门天桥被杀真相
    被反革命暴徒残酷杀害后又暴尸崇文门过街天桥上的战士的身份查清了！他就是戒严部队某部榴炮二连战士崔国政烈士。
    ６月９日，笔者采访了目睹崔国政烈士被害经过的官兵。下面是他们的谈话实录。
    指导员初慧民：不知为什么，有些北京市民不信真话，却偏偏听信小道消息。就拿我们连战士崔国政被害一事来说吧，大街小巷就传得很厉害。有人说亲眼看见崔国政连续枪杀了３个老百姓之后，被愤怒的群众打死了。还有人说他枪杀了一个跪在地上求他不要开枪的老大娘后，被老大娘的儿子打死后吊到过街天桥上，等等。作为一个现场的目击者、当事人，我真不知道这些造谣者居心何在，真恨不能给这些不负责任、随意乱嚼舌头的人两记耳光！
    事实的真相是这样的：６月４日凌晨４时３０分左右，我们奉命到北京市执行戒严任务。当车队行驶到崇文门内大街与西大街交叉路口时，遇到了一伙暴徒和不明真相群众的拦截。前面的两台车受阻后立即调头改线前进，而我们乘坐的这台车却因挂着炊事车，体积大，调头时被马路牙子卡住了。车一熄火，暴徒们先是用石头、砖块、汽水瓶疯狂袭击，接着就蜂拥而上，有的扯掉车上的篷布，有的给车胎放气，有的掀开发动机盖拽掉电线。一伙手持铁棍、木棒、燃烧瓶、砖头、石块的歹徒则爬到车上殴打战士，抢夺枪支弹药。几个歹徒凶狠地把坐在驾驶室里的代理连长王峰和驾驶员李井民拽出来就是一顿猛揍，边揍边狂呼：“打死这个当官的！”“把司机打残，他们就跑不掉了！”李井民当场就被打得口吐白沫昏了过去。连长的头上、身上有八九处伤口，头部最大的一处有两寸多长。即便是这样，歹徒们还觉得不够劲，又架起昏了过去的李井民狂呼：“当兵的，快把枪支弹药交出来吧！你们有人质在我们手里呢。”
    班长张振宇：看到连长被打得满身是血，战友被打昏了又遭绑架，心里气愤极了，真想开枪教训一下这伙暴徒。可一想到上级不许开枪的命令。为了不误伤好人，我们还是忍住没有放一枪。
    指导员初慧民：为了减少伤亡，我与从暴徒之手挣脱出来的连长商量后，决定弃车突围。
    中士孙朝恒：指导员在前面开路，我和孙福泉架着连长断后。当我们１１个人突围到了一个人行天桥上时，都被眼前的情景惊呆了：一伙歹徒不知从哪里架来了３位五六十岁的老大娘，推捅着向我们逼了过来（指导员：歹徒们知道我们不能向人民开枪，弄她们来充当挡箭牌）。３个身不由己的老大娘战战兢兢地边走边喊：“孩子们，千万别开枪啊！”在快要接近我们的时候，老大娘们被歹徒们推搡着跪下了。见此情景，连长、指导员和我抢前一步，也跪下去搀扶３位老人家。指导员边扶老人边对她们说：“您们都和我们的妈妈一样亲，我们怎么能向您老开枪呢！求求您了，快回去吧，千万别上坏人的当！”就在这时，暴徒们乘我们去搀扶救助老人之机，拳脚交加，棍棒横飞，将跟在队伍中的崔国政打昏后拖走了。这时，一位４０多岁的群众提醒我们不要再坚持下去了，这伙人已经到了丧心病狂的程度，弄不好，你们都要惨死在他们手中，并主动把我们带到了国防科工委招待所墙外。这时，一个男青年拿着一支冲锋枪送过来说：“你们那个人被打得不行了，你们赶快跳墙走吧。这支枪是那个被打战士的，被我从一个歹徒手里抢了回来。”我们进院后，立即得到了招待所人员的热情照顾和精心救治。
    指导员初慧民：后来，亲眼看见崔国政惨死的群众告诉我，他被打得不省人事之后，被几个暴徒抬起来从过街天桥上摔了下去。当时，昏迷的崔国政还有一点知觉，他在地上痛苦地抽缩着四肢。见此情景，有的暴徒哈哈大笑，有的暴徒跑到桥下往崔国政的身上浇满了汽油后点燃，将其活活烧死。至此，穷凶极恶的暴徒还觉得不够狠，又找来绳子，将崔国政烧焦了的尸体吊起来示众。你说，崔国政死得多惨！
    到现在为止，司机李井民还下落不明，生死未卜。
