Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa said on June 20 in the Sri Lankan Parliament that the Indian Peacekeeping Forces deployed in the northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka have failed to protect the safety of Muslims and Sinhalese there.

According to the peace agreement signed by India and Sri Lanka in 1987, India sent about 50,000 troops to the northern and eastern parts of Sri Lanka to protect local citizens and to disarm Tamil militants to maintain peace there.

Premadasa said that two years have passed, but the Tamil militants have not been disarmed.

Sri Lankan President Premadasa has formally requested that India withdraw all its troops from Sri Lanka by the end of July.

    斯里兰卡总理说
    在斯印军未能履行诺言
    新华社科伦坡6月21日电  斯里兰卡总理维杰通加20日在斯议会发表讲话说，部署在斯北部和东部的印度维持和平部队未能保护那里的穆斯林和僧伽罗人的安全。
    根据印斯双方1987年签订的和平协议，印度向斯北部和东部派遣约5万名印军承担保护当地公民的义务，并且负责解除泰米尔人的武装以维持那里的和平。
    维杰通加总理说，两年过去了，泰米尔人的武装也未被解除掉。
    斯总统普雷马达萨已经正式要求印度在7月底以前从斯撤出所有军队。
