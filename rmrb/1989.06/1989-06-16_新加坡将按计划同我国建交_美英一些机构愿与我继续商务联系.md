Singapore to Establish Diplomatic Relations with China as Planned

According to reports from Singaporean newspapers today, Singapore's First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, Goh Chok Tong, stated on June 14 during his visit to Japan that the issue of establishing diplomatic relations between Singapore and China will proceed as planned.

He made these remarks during an interview with the Japanese Economic News.

When asked by the reporter whether Western investments in Hong Kong might flow into Singapore, he replied that the outflow of funds from Hong Kong would not be beneficial for the economies of Southeast Asia.

In March of this year, Singapore's Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew reiterated the stance of recognizing only one China and expressed that after China normalizes its relations with Indonesia, Singapore will establish diplomatic relations with China.

Some U.S. and British Institutions Will Continue Business Ties with China

According to a report published in the U.S. Commercial Daily on June 15, several department heads of major American and British companies and banks stated to the newspaper's reporter that they are prepared to continue business ties with China as before.

The deputy manager of Rockwell International's Beijing office, Robert Yeager, said that Rockwell International will continue to sell electronic equipment to China. He added, "We hope to sell equipment related to the military, but we have not done so yet."

Howard Sheldon, the Asia-Pacific director of Dow Chemical Company, expressed that Dow Chemical Company will continue to implement the agreement to build a pharmaceutical factory worth $50 million in Ningbo in cooperation with China.

Robin Brilliant, the manager in charge of Chinese investments at Lloyds Bank of the UK, said that the Hong Kong branch of the Bank of China is making payments on time according to the letter of credit, and the Chinese side seems to be "very serious about maintaining their international credibility."
