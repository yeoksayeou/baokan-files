The Qiang flute master Chen Haiyuan spoke passionately, taking out a Qiang flute for us to examine closely. It was a pair of square bamboo tubes, about the thickness of a thumb, tied together with thread, approximately five or six inches long, with a bamboo reed inserted at the top and six finger holes. He picked it up and played it vertically, the sound was mournful and plaintive, as if lamenting, attracting a group of Qiang new recruits who were having a meeting in the courtyard of the Maoxian County Committee...

The Qiang people living along the Minjiang River in the upper reaches are one of the oldest ethnic groups in China, with their own language but no written script. Their oral literature, folk music, and dances are rich and varied, spanning thousands of years. How can this precious ethnic heritage be preserved and promoted? In early April, we went to Maoxian County, where the Qiang people live, to conduct interviews on this issue with the director of the county cultural center, Yu Guangyuan.

This forty-year-old Qiang director said, "Yesterday, you visited the Qiang Museum. The historical relics and folk customs of the Qiang people exhibited there were set up last November during the Qiang New Year. As for our cultural center, over the years, with the guidance and help of higher authorities, we have conducted extensive collection and organization of Qiang folk music, dances, folk songs, and folk tales, and have compiled a series of collected works, such as 'Collection of Folk Music and Dances,' 'Collection of Folk Tales,' 'Collection of Folk Songs,' and 'Ancient Chanting Scriptures of Qiang Shamans.' Some of the folk songs and dances we have created, such as the Armor Dance and the Qiang flute, have been performed in Beijing and even abroad, and some programs have won awards."

The next day, we visited Dong Fangquan, a Qiang music worker and member of the Sichuan Music Association. He is thirty-four years old, wears black-rimmed glasses, and appears somewhat scholarly. When introducing his work experience, he couldn't help but sing a Qiang folk song, "Naji Nana," with tears in his eyes. He said, "This is our Qiang folk song, meaning that I am a descendant of the Qiang people." This song has dozens of verses, and now most of the elderly in the Qiang villages can sing it. Dong Fangquan continued, "That year, I heard Wang Guai Guai, an old lady in the mountain village, sing this song. The more she sang, the more excited she became, and she cried, and the people listening around her also cried. Influenced by the situation at that time, now I can't help but cry when I sing this song."

Dong Fangquan, from junior high school to working in a farm, has always loved Qiang songs and dances and often performs. After being transferred to work at the county cultural center, he systematically studied history and literature, and also went to Sichuan Music Academy for a year of further study. Dong Fangquan, undeterred by hardship, went to all the Qiang villages to collect Qiang songs and dances. Some villages are over 3,000 meters above sea level, taking several days to reach. Qiang singers perform, and he records every word and phrase, understands each lyric, translates them into Chinese one by one, and sings them back to the Qiang singers for verification. Over nearly five years, Dong Fangquan has collected over 1,500 Qiang folk songs and selected 263 of the best to compile into a book. Dong Fangquan said that from Qiang folk songs and dances, one can understand their joys, sorrows, and the temperament of their nation.

The second person I interviewed was Li Jizhu, who is enthusiastic about Qiang folk stories. He is very outgoing and the first thing he said to me was, "I became fascinated with Qiang folk literature and eventually became a member of the Folk Literature and Art Association, which can be said to be a stroke of luck."

Li Jizhu worked at the county horticultural farm, and there was a Qiang driver in the nearby Tudian Township who could tell many folk stories and sing mountain songs. Li Jizhu listened to the driver tell a few stories and was hooked, running there whenever he had free time, and recording the stories and songs he heard. Later, Li Jizhu was transferred to the county cultural center and could devote himself to the work he loved. Over the years, Li Jizhu has left his footprints in almost all the Qiang villages in Maoxian County, collecting nearly 400 folk songs and over 260 folk stories, totaling tens of millions of words, all of which have been compiled into books and become valuable resources. Some of the Qiang folk stories collected and created by Li Jizhu have been compiled into books.

A foreign publication once published an article saying that the Qiang, the oldest ethnic group in China, has disappeared from the Chinese land. This is not true. The Qiang people living along the Minjiang River had only over 30,000 people when New China was founded, and now their population has grown to over 100,000; Sichuan used to have a Maowen Qiang Autonomous County, and now there is an Aba Tibetan and Qiang Autonomous Prefecture. Ten years of reform and opening up have not only made the economy of the Qiang-inhabited areas increasingly prosperous but also enabled their ethnic culture to be well inherited and promoted. Qiang folk songs and dances have participated in provincial and national performances many times, and some programs have won awards. Qiang folk songs and dances, as well as some historical relics, have also been performed and exhibited abroad, receiving good reviews from international friends.

### 羌管悠扬诉心声

　　羌管悠扬诉心声
    本报记者  吴学林
    羌笛演奏家陈海元谈得兴浓，拿出一只羌笛让我们细看。那是两根拇指粗的方形竹管用丝线缠紧的笛子，约五六寸长，管头插着竹簧，有六个按孔。他拿起竖着吹奏，声音悠扬、婉转，如怨如诉，引得一群正在茂县县委院子里开会的羌族新兵围了上来……
    居住在岷江上游河畔的羌人，是我国最古老的民族，有自己的语言，然而没有自己的文字。他们的口头文学、民间音乐舞蹈丰富多采，绵延数千年，到如今，如何保存和发扬这份宝贵的民族遗产呢？四月初，我们到羌族聚居的四川省茂县采访，就这个问题请教县文化馆馆长余光远。
    这位四十岁的羌族馆长说：“你们昨天参观了羌族博物馆，那里的羌族历史文物和民俗展览，是去年十一月羌历年才办起来的。就我们文化馆说，这些年在上级的指导帮助下，对羌族民间音乐舞蹈、民谣、民间传说故事进行了广泛的收集和整理工作，并且编印了一系列的集成资料卷，如《民间音乐舞蹈集成》、《民间故事集成》、《民谣集成》、《羌族巫师古唱经》等。我们创作的一些民间歌舞如盔甲舞，还有羌笛，拿到北京以至国外表演过，有些节目还获奖哩。”
    第二天，我们又访问了羌族音乐工作者、四川音乐学会会员董方权。他今年三十四岁，戴黑边眼镜，显得有点斯文。在介绍自己的工作经历时，他禁不住引吭高唱一曲羌族民歌《纳吉纳那》，眼里闪着泪花。他说：“这是我们羌族自己的民歌，意思是说，我是羌族的后代。”这首歌有几十段，现在羌寨里大多数老人都会唱。董方权接着说：“那年，我在山寨里听王拐拐老太太唱这首歌，她愈唱愈激动，自己哭了，旁边听的人也哭了。受当时情景的影响，现在我唱这首歌也止不住要流泪。”
    董方权从读初中到进农场当工人，一直非常喜爱羌族歌舞，经常出去表演。调到县文化馆工作以后，他系统学习历史、文学方面的知识，还到四川音乐学院进修一年。董方权不辞辛苦，到所有羌寨去搜集羌族歌舞，有些山寨在海拔三四千米以上，要走几天才能走到。羌族歌手演唱，他逐字逐句记录，弄懂每个唱词，一个一个翻译成汉文，再唱给羌族歌手听，进行核对。在近五年的时间里，董方权搜集羌族民间歌曲一千五百多首，再从中精选出二百六十三首汇集成册。董方权说，从羌族民歌和舞蹈中，可以了解他们的喜怒哀乐，了解他们民族的气质。
    我访问的第二位是热心羌族民间故事的李冀祖。他很开朗，见到我的头一句话就说：“我迷上羌族民间文学，竟然成为民间文艺家协会会员，可以说是机遇。”
    李冀祖在县园艺场当工人时，附近土门乡有位羌族司机，会讲许多民间故事，也会唱山歌。李冀祖听这位司机讲过几次故事就给迷住了，一有空就朝那里跑，并把所听的故事和歌谣记下来。后来李冀祖调到县文化馆，可以专心从事自己迷上的工作了。这些年来，茂县绝大多数羌寨都留下李冀祖的足迹，他收集民谣近四百首，民间故事二百六十多篇，共有好几十万字，都编印成册，成为宝贵的资料。李冀祖征集和创作的羌族民间故事有些已集册成书。
    国外有个刊物曾经发表文章说，羌族这个最古老的民族在中国大地上消失了。这话不是事实。居住在岷江河畔的羌人，新中国成立时只有三万多人，现在已发展到十多万人；四川过去有个茂汶羌族自治县，现在有个阿坝藏族羌族自治州。十年改革开放，不仅促使羌族聚居的地区经济日益繁荣，也使他们的民族文化得到很好的继承和发扬。羌族民间歌舞多次参加全省和全国的演出，有些节目获奖。羌族的民间歌舞和部分历史文物还到国外表演和展出过，得到国际友人的好评。
