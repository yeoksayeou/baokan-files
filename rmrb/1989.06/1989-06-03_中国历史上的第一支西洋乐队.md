The first Western orchestra in Chinese history

Kangxi Emperor was one of the few monarchs in history who had a deep appreciation for Western learning and a comprehensive understanding of both Chinese and Western cultures. He not only had extensive knowledge in geometry, algebra, astronomy, calendars, arithmetic, and medicine, but also had a profound understanding of Western music theory and Western musical instruments.

Over three hundred years ago, Western missionaries serving in the imperial court, such as Ferdinand Verbiest and Xu Risheng, presented various Western musical instruments to Kangxi Emperor, which sparked his great interest. Kangxi learned to play Western musical instruments and performed Western music using these instruments. However, at that time, only Kangxi in the Forbidden City possessed this skill, and there were no fellow enthusiasts.

After Qianlong Emperor ascended the throne, he seemed to remember his ancestor's fondness for Western musical instruments and music. One day, he suddenly had the idea to establish a Western wind and string orchestra consisting of fourteen eunuchs within the Forbidden City. In the records of the Neiwufu Zaobanchu, which documented the production activities, there are mentions of Western musicians coming to China to present instruments, the storage of Western musical instruments in the palace, the formation and rehearsals of the orchestra, and the costumes and props used by the orchestra. The Western musical instruments presented by the foreigners at that time included organs, cellos, violins, Western flutes (clarinets and oboes), and wire-stringed instruments (possibly pianos). In the seventh year of Qianlong's reign, the emperor issued an order to have the various Western musical instruments presented by the foreigners taught to young eunuchs in the Yu Hua Lou. Thus, a small wind and string orchestra primarily performing palace music was born within the Qing Palace, marking the first Western orchestra in Chinese history. During performances, the eunuchs dressed in a peculiar blend of Eastern and Western styles to amuse Qianlong.

In reality, Qianlong Emperor did not understand Western music. The orchestra he assembled could at most satisfy his curiosity and serve as a form of entertainment to liven up the atmosphere.

    中国历史上的第一支西洋乐队
    康熙皇帝是历史上少有的雅好西学、学贯中西的君主，他不仅对几何、代数、天文、历法、算术、医学等自然科学颇有研究，而且对西洋乐理和西洋乐器也造诣不浅。
    距今三百多年前，由供奉内廷的西洋传教士南怀仁、徐日升等人向康熙皇帝进献了许多西洋乐器，从而引起了康熙皇帝的极大兴趣。康熙学会了西洋乐理和西洋乐器的演奏，并用西洋乐器演奏了西洋乐曲。不过那时的紫禁城内，只有康熙一人独擅此技，并无知音。
    乾隆皇帝即位后，似乎想起了乃祖对西洋乐器和乐曲的爱好。一天，他突然心血来潮，破天荒地在紫禁城中建立了一支由十四名太监组成的西洋管弦乐队。在记载内务府造办处传办活计的《各作成做活清档》中就有西洋乐师来华供奉与进献乐器，宫内收贮西洋乐器及乐队的组成、排练和乐队的服装道具等。当时来华洋人进献的西洋乐器有风琴、长拉琴（大提琴）、小拉琴（小提琴）、西洋箫（单簧管、双簧管）、铁丝琴（可能是钢琴）等。乾隆七年，乾隆皇帝下旨：将洋人进献的各种西洋乐器在陆花楼教小太监弹奏。这样以演奏宫内乐为主的小型管弦乐队在清宫内诞生了，这是我国历史上的第一支西洋乐队。演出时，演奏的太监们打扮成不中不西的怪模样，以博乾隆一笑。
    其实，乾隆皇帝并不懂得西洋音乐，他下旨拼凑起来的这么一支滑稽乐队，充其量只能是满足他的好奇心，并以此当杂耍凑热闹罢了。
