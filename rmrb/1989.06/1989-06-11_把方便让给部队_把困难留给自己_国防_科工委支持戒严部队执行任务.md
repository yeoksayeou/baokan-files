The People's Daily, Beijing, June 11th

The leadership and staff of the Commission of Science, Technology, and Industry for National Defense (COSTIND) are fully committed to solving practical difficulties for the martial law troops, providing a stable working and living environment for the troops stationed in the COSTIND headquarters and military camps.

On June 3rd, when the martial law troops encountered obstacles and were attacked by rioters, COSTIND dispatched nearly 200 staff members and technical personnel to form a working team, risking their lives to assist the troops in danger. On June 4th, the first batch of martial law troops had not yet been fully settled in the COSTIND camp when they received a notice to accommodate another batch of martial law troops. To help the troops quickly recover their strength and alleviate fatigue, the management department broke the rules and specially arranged for the troops to take showers. They also took all the carpets from the office building to use as bedding for the martial law troops. The martial law troops arrived at the camp at 1:30 AM and were greeted by the COSTIND staff who had stayed up all night. They were then served their first decent meal in two days.

To ensure the organizational command of this martial law troop, the communication department immediately provided 49 automatic telephones and two long-distance single machines. Upon learning that one of their radios had been damaged by rioters, they quickly provided a replacement. To ensure communication and liaison during mobile patrols, they provided 7 sets of walkie-talkies for the martial law troops to use.

The relevant responsible persons of COSTIND convened two meetings with the staff to study various plans and contingency measures, requiring that even in the event of power outages, water shortages, and interruptions in grain, oil, and gas supply, the needs of the martial law troops to complete their missions must be met. To this end, the departments of personnel, politics, and logistics, under unified command, established smooth contact with the corresponding institutions of the martial law troops to build a direct service relationship. The business departments, warehouses, oil depots, and grain depots have all made necessary preparations.

　　把方便让给部队　把困难留给自己
    国防  科工委支持戒严部队执行任务
    本报北京６月１１日讯  国防科工委领导和机关工作人员全力以赴为戒严部队解决实际困难，使驻在科工委机关和部队营区的戒严部队有了一个稳定的工作和生活环境。
    ６月３日，在戒严部队进城受阻、遭到暴徒围攻的紧急关头，科工委派出近２００名机关干部、科技人员组成工作队，冒着生命危险去接应在危难中的受阻部队。６月４日，第一批进驻国防科工委营区的戒严部队尚未安置就绪，仅隔一天，又接到进驻一支戒严部队的通知。为使部队尽快恢复体力、消除疲劳，管理部门打破常规，专门安排部队洗了澡。他们还把办公楼内所有的地毯都拿出来，让戒严部队当褥子。戒严部队凌晨一时半来到营区，受到彻夜不眠的国防科工委机关干部的夹道欢迎，接着又吃上了两天来第一顿可口的饭菜。
    为保证这支戒严部队组织指挥，通信部门立即提供了４９部自动电话和两部长途单机。听说他们的一部电台被暴徒破坏，马上又给解决一部。为保证流动执勤的通信联络，拿出７套播话机（对讲机）供戒严部队使用。
    科工委有关负责人两次召集机关开会，研究多种方案和预案，要求做到即使在停电、停水和粮、油、气供应不上的情况下，也要满足戒严部队完成戒严任务的需要。为此，司、政、后各业务部门在统一指挥下，与戒严部队相应的机构取得联系，建立了对口服务的顺畅关系。业务部门、仓库、油库、粮库都做了必要的储备。
