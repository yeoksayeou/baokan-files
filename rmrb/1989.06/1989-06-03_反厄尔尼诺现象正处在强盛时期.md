The chief scientist of the Chinese side, Wang Zongshan, who is executing the Sino-American cooperative research task on ocean-atmosphere interactions, revealed on May 30 aboard the "Zhongguo Haijian" No. 14 oceanographic research vessel of the State Oceanic Administration: comprehensive analysis of a large amount of first-hand data obtained from this voyage indicates that the tropical western Pacific is currently experiencing a relatively strong La Niña period.

Wang Zongshan said that during the formation of El Niño, the eastern Pacific typically warms up, with sea temperatures rising, while the western Pacific is relatively cooler, with sea temperatures lower. The opposite of this is known as the La Niña phenomenon. Following the El Niño event that occurred between 1986 and 1987, which had a global climate impact, after a period of dynamic adjustment and incubation, by October to November of last year, the western Pacific began to show noticeable warm water accumulation. Sea water temperatures above 29 degrees Celsius have occupied the broad area west of 162 degrees east longitude and south of 7 to 14 degrees north latitude, at depths of 50 to 95 meters. It can be inferred that the tropical western Pacific is currently in a relatively strong La Niña period, which has prepared certain conditions for the possible outbreak of a new El Niño event in the future. Wang Zongshan believes that the occurrence of the La Niña phenomenon may bring relatively favorable signs for China's climate.

    反厄尔尼诺现象正处在强盛时期
    本报西太平洋专电　执行中美海洋与大气相互作用合作研究任务的中方首席科学家王宗山，5月30日在国家海洋局向阳红14号远洋科学考察船上披露：从本航次获得的大量第一手资料综合分析表明，热带西太平洋目前正处于较强的反厄尔尼诺时期。
    王宗山说，在厄尔尼诺形成期间，通常是东太平洋变暖，海水温度升高，西太平洋相对较冷，海水温度偏低，与此相反的则称为反厄尔尼诺现象。自1986——1987年爆发影响全球气候的厄尔尼诺之后，经过一段时间的动力调整和孕育，到去年10至11月，西太平洋即开始出现了较明显的暖水堆积。高于29度的海水已占据东经162度以西和北纬7—14度一线以南的50—95米深的广大海域。可以推断，热带西太平洋目前正处在较强的反厄尔尼诺时期，它为未来再次爆发新的厄尔尼诺现象准备了一定的条件。王宗山认为反厄尔尼诺现象的出现，可能会给我国的气候带来较好的征兆。
