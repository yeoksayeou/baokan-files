Pakistan Proposes New Solution to the Afghan Problem

	In Afghanistan, Establish a Neutral Expert Cabinet
	As a Transitional Institution for Short-Term Governance

	Xinhua News Agency, Islamabad, June 14 — The spokesperson for Pakistan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs said on the 14th that Pakistan advocates for the establishment of a short-term governing neutral expert cabinet in Afghanistan as a transitional institution to transfer power to the provisional government of the Afghan Mujahideen.

	The spokesperson said that during Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto's recent visit to the United States, she discussed this idea with United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar. This is because the UN Secretary-General can engage with all parties involved in the Afghan issue, including the Soviet Union. Pakistan is also in contact with the Soviet Union to seek a peaceful resolution to the Afghan problem.

	He said, as Prime Minister Benazir Bhutto reiterated, the Kabul regime should step down because it has become the main obstacle to a peaceful resolution of the Afghan problem.

	The spokesperson said that once the Soviet Union agrees to this proposal, it will play a significant role in resolving the Afghan problem.

	The spokesperson said that Benazir Bhutto assured the leaders of the United States and the United Nations Secretary-General that she supports a political solution to the Afghan problem.

	He also said that Pakistan will continue to urge the Afghan people to adopt a political approach to solve the problem.

　　巴基斯坦提出解决阿富汗问题新建议
    在阿成立中立专家内阁
    作为过渡机构短期执政
    新华社伊斯兰堡６月１４日电  巴基斯坦外交部发言人１４日说，巴基斯坦主张在阿富汗成立一个短期执政的中立专家内阁，作为过渡机构，将政权移交给阿富汗游击队临时政府。
    这位发言人说，贝·布托总理在最近访美期间，同联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔讨论了这一设想。因为联合国秘书长德奎利亚尔能同包括苏联在内的阿富汗问题所有方面进行接触。巴基斯坦也在同苏联接触，以求阿富汗问题得以和平解决。
    他说，正如贝·布托总理重申那样，喀布尔政权应当下台，因为它已成为和平解决阿富汗问题的主要障碍。
    这位发言人说，一旦苏联同意这一建议，它将在解决阿富汗问题方面发挥很大作用。
    发言人说，贝·布托向美国领导人和联合国秘书长保证，她赞成政治解决阿富汗问题。
    他还说，巴基斯坦将继续敦促阿富汗人采取政治解决问题的方式。
