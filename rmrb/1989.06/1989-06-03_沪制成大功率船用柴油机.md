Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 3rd.

Shanghai's Hudong Shipyard and Shanghai Shipyard have jointly manufactured the first Sulzer low-speed marine diesel engine. After a period of running-in, adjustment, and test runs, the engine has recently passed the inspection by representatives of the shipowner, the Germanischer Lloyd of the Federal Republic of Germany, and the China Classification Society.

This diesel engine, with a power output of 23,100 kilowatts, is the most powerful marine diesel engine ever produced in China to date.

The diesel engine jointly manufactured by Hudong Shipyard and Shanghai Shipyard weighs a total of 1,050 tons and stands tall on the test bed, resembling a five-story steel building. It will serve as the main engine for a 2,700 TEU refrigerated container ship that Hudong Shipyard is building for the Federal Republic of Germany.
