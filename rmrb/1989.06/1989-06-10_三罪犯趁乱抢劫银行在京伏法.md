Three criminals who exploited chaos to rob a bank were executed in Beijing this morning. According to Xinhua News Agency, the three criminals, Jin Wencheng, Zhang Jing (female), and Li Longnan, were sentenced to death and executed by firing squad.

On the evening of April 27 this year, Jin Wencheng, Zhang Jing, and Li Longnan took advantage of the disorder caused by students protesting in the streets and the resulting traffic chaos. They carried knives and burst into the Beijing Post and Telecommunications Institute branch of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China in Haidian District, stealing nearly 60,000 yuan. Prior to this incident, the three had also conspired to commit two other robberies. In preparation for robbing the bank, they had also planned to steal firearms and ammunition but were thwarted by police dogs.
