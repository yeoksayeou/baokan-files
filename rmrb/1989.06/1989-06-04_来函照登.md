	People's Daily Editorial Department:

	The report titled "A Reading Society for Everyone in Hangzhou" published on the fourth page of your newspaper on May 6th of this year contains inaccuracies.

	1. The reading society is not "self-sustaining." Last year, my library allocated over 30,000 yuan from its operational funds for it.

	2. The reading society is not about "reading books"; it merely lends out periodicals. The correct term should be "periodical lending society," and it cannot be compared to the entire work and functions of a library.

	3. This year, due to the inability to cover the losses amounting to tens of thousands of yuan, it has been forced to scale down.

    人民日报编辑部：
    贵报今年五月六日第四版的报道《杭州有个人人读书社》，与事实有出入。
    一、这个读书社根本不是“自负盈亏”，去年我馆就在事业费中为它开支了三万元以上的费用。
    二、读书社并非“读书”，仅仅是出借期刊，正确的说法应是“读刊社”，不能和图书馆的全部工作和职能类比。
    三、今年由于赔不起这笔数万元的款子，已被迫加以收缩。
