Foreign Investment in Fujian Remains Strong
	Foreign Investors Continue to Flock to Fujian
	35 New Contracts Approved in First Half of June, Totaling Over $40 Million

FUZHOU, June 23 (Xinhua) — Foreign investors continue to show strong interest in Fujian Province. From June 1 to 15, Fujian approved 35 new foreign investment contracts worth a total of $41.658 million. "I am confident that the Chinese government has the ability to stabilize the situation and manage the country well. The policy of reform and opening up will not change," said the chairman of the newly opened Fujian Jinlong Real Estate Co., Ltd. on June 19. His words may reflect the sentiments of some foreign investors.

From January to May this year, Fujian's utilization of foreign capital, which grew by 2.9 times last year, has maintained a good momentum. Foreign investors signed 399 new investment contracts, with a total contract value of $285 million, representing a 57% and 1.19 times increase over the same period last year, respectively. Among these, 116 projects are Taiwanese investments, totaling $102 million, accounting for 29% of the total number of projects and 35% of the total contract value. Solely-owned enterprises accounted for 126 projects, with a total value of $123 million, representing a 3.2 times and 3.1 times increase over the same period last year, respectively. The total industrial output value of the three types of enterprises (foreign-funded, joint ventures, and cooperative enterprises) reached 2.09 billion yuan, a 55% increase over the same period last year.

This year, Fujian's foreign investment contracts have the following characteristics: First, the majority of foreign investments are directed towards productive projects, with a focus on export-oriented enterprises, import-substituting enterprises, and technologically advanced enterprises. Second, a significant proportion of the investments are from Taiwan. Xiamen, which has attracted a considerable amount of Taiwanese investment, has already approved 67 Taiwanese projects by the beginning of June, accounting for 60% of the total foreign investment projects, a 1.2 times increase over the same period last year. Third, the contract fulfillment rate is relatively high. Of the 300 foreign investment projects signed at the Xiamen Investment and Trade Fair in September last year, 61% have already obtained business licenses.

Due to the efforts made by Fujian Province in the previous period to stabilize the situation, all three types of enterprises in the province have not stopped production, and more than 80% of these enterprises have achieved good economic results. Foreign investors are satisfied with the social stability in Fujian and have expressed their willingness to further improve their enterprises and expand their investments.

In response to the specific difficulties faced by the three types of enterprises, the provincial and municipal foreign economic and trade departments have organized on-site offices and door-to-door services to help solve their problems.

　　外商在福建投资势头不减    
    ６月上旬批准外资合同３５项金额４０００多万美元
    本报福州６月２３日电  记者张铭清报道：进入６月，来闽洽谈投资的外商络绎不绝。从６月１日至１５日，福建就新批外商直接投资合同３５项，协议金额达４１６５．８万美元。“我坚信中国政府有能力稳定局势，有能力治理好国家，改革开放的方针是不会变的”。６月１９日新开业的福建金龙地产有限公司董事长的这番话，也许能代表一些外商的心声。
    今年１至５月，福建利用外资在去年增长２．９倍的基础上，一直保持了良好的发展势头。外商新签投资合同３９９项，协议金额达２．８５亿美元，分别比去年同期增长５７％和１．１９倍。其中台资企业１１６项，金额１．０２亿美元，分别占总项目数和总金额数的２９％和３５％。独资企业１２６项，金额１．２３亿美元，分别比去年同期增长３．２倍和３．１倍。三资企业工业总产值２０．９亿元，比去年同期增长５５％。
    今年福建签订的外资合同有以下特点：一是外资投向绝大多数是生产性项目，重点是出口创汇企业、进口替代企业和技术先进企业。二是台资所占比例大。吸收台资比较集中的厦门，到６月上旬，台资项目已达６７个，占吸收外资项目的６０％，比去年同期增长１．２倍。三是履约率较高。去年９月在厦门投资洽谈会上签定的３００个利用外资项目已有６１％办理了开业执照。
    由于前一阶段福建省做了大量稳定局势的工作，全省三资企业无一家停产，而且８０％以上的三资企业都取得了较好的经济效益。外商对福建的社会安定比较满意，表示要进一步办好企业，扩大投资。
    针对三资企业的具体困难，省市外经部门组织了现场办公、上门服务，为其排忧解难。
