Another reporter asked: On the 7th of this month, the martial law troops fired at the diplomatic compound outside Jian Guo Men, damaging furniture and other equipment. Will the Chinese side apologize for this?

    外交公寓枪击事件中公寓里无人伤亡
    新华社北京六月二十二日电  外交部发言人李金华今天说，现在北京局势已恢复正常，一些外商已表示将来华继续洽谈生意，也有一些外国公司决定继续在中国投资。
    她在下午的新闻发布会上答记者问时说，在北京发生暴乱的情况下，一些在华外国人出于安全方面的考虑，暂时离开了中国，这是可以理解的。
    李金华说，中国将坚持改革开放政策，继续发展同外国的经济技术合作。希望外国继续发展同中国的合作，这对双方都有利。
    另有记者问：本月七日戒严部队向建国门外外交公寓开枪，损害家具及其他设备，中国方面是否准备为此表示歉意？
    李金华答道：中国人民解放军戒严部队是在受到来自外交公寓的枪弹袭击时进行还击的。对这一事件，中国政府做了迅速的处理。在这一过程中，公寓中无人伤亡。
