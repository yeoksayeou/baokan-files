Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 14th.

According to information from the Communist Party of China Central Committee State Organs Work Committee, the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office and 12 other units have successively written to the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, expressing their firm support for the central authorities' decision to suppress the counterrevolutionary riot in the capital.

The 13 units are: the State Council's Hong Kong and Macao Affairs Office, the State Council's Advisory Office, the Chinese People's Association for Friendship with Foreign Countries, the China Kanghua Development Corporation, the China Industrial and Commercial Economic Development Corporation, the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, the China New Technology Development Investment Corporation, the China State Construction Engineering Corporation, the Chinese Federation of Literary and Art Circles, the China Automobile Industry Association, the State Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, the Soong Ching-ling Foundation, and the National Committee on Aging.

In recent days, these units have organized their Party members, cadres, and staff to study the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Entire Nation" issued by the Communist Party of China Central Committee and the State Council. They have also listened to and watched important news about the situation in the capital, and studied Deng Xiaoping's important speech during his meeting with military officers above the rank of division commander. Everyone believes that the serious counterrevolutionary riot that occurred in the capital was deliberately instigated by a small number of people. It was bound to happen sooner or later and was inevitable. The goal was to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, to overthrow the socialist system, and to subvert the People's Republic of China. If their plot succeeded, the republic won by the blood and sacrifice of countless revolutionary martyrs would be destroyed, and our reform, opening up, and socialist construction would be in vain. Everyone is convinced that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, this struggle will definitely achieve final victory. They also expressed their determination to unite closely around the Party Central Committee, to work hard with practical actions, to focus on production, and to contribute to the stabilization of the situation in the capital and the entire country.

　　国务院港澳办等十三个单位致信中央
    坚决拥护平息首都反革命暴乱
    新华社北京６月１４日电  据来自中共中央国家机关工委的消息：国务院港澳办公室等１３个单位先后致信党中央、国务院、中央军委，表示坚决拥护中央平息反革命暴乱的重大决策。
    这１３个单位是：国务院港澳办公室、国务院参事室、中国人民对外友好协会、中国康华发展总公司、中国工商经济开发公司、中国海洋石油总公司、中国新技术开发投资总公司、中国建筑工程总公司、中国文学艺术界联合会、中国汽车工业联合会、国家中医药管理局、宋庆龄基金会、中国老龄问题全国委员会。
    连日来，这些单位认真组织党员、干部、职工学习了中共中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》，收听、收看了有关首都局势的重要新闻，学习了邓小平同志在接见戒严部队军以上干部时的重要讲话。大家认为，这次发生在首都的严重的反革命暴乱，是极少数人蓄意制造的，是或迟或早要发生的，是不以人的意志为转移的，目的是要推翻共产党的领导，推翻社会主义制度，颠覆中华人民共和国。如果让他们的阴谋得逞，千百万革命先烈流血牺牲换来的共和国就会毁于一旦，我们的改革、开放和社会主义建设大业就会付之东流。大家坚信，在党中央、国务院的正确领导下，这场斗争一定能取得最后胜利；并表示要紧密地团结在党中央周围，以实际行动，努力工作，抓好生产，为稳定首都和全国局势作出贡献。
