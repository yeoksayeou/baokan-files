Anshan Traffic Bureau Road Administration Department official Guo Jingxiao neglected his duties, arbitrarily shut down the water pump switch of Tangjiafang Steel Plant, causing a serious accident involving an explosion in the blast furnace water tank and furnace body. The direct economic loss amounted to 340,000 yuan. He has recently been arrested by law.

The 52-year-old Guo Jingxiao, on May 11 this year, accompanied the traffic management department of Anshan's Jiufu District to inspect road barriers in Tangjiafang Town. After lunch at a restaurant, at around 2 PM, he and 12 others arrived at Tangjiafang Steel Plant in three cars. Guo Jingxiao believed that the water pump station built by the steel plant along the road and the river was an illegal structure. He walked over and turned off the control switch of the operating water pump. The workers in the pump room noticed the pump had stopped and immediately came out to ask, "Who stopped the pump?" Guo Jingxiao pointed to himself and shouted, "I did!" "If the pump stops, the furnace will collapse!" "I don't care if it collapses or not!" Despite repeated pleas, Guo Jingxiao remained obstinate and refused to restart the pump, watching as the blast furnace experienced a partial explosion. Seeing the situation turn bad, he quickly drove away.

The once fiery blast furnace is now in ruins; over 6 tons of steel raw materials are solidified in the furnace; more than 100 workers are forced to take extended leave, and the steel products with good sales are unable to be produced. The workers angrily said: Guo Jingxiao abuses his authority like this, he doesn't act like a Communist Party member!

　　凭借“执法”耍特权　国家损失三十四万    
    鞍山交通局干部郭景孝被捕
    新华社沈阳６月２８日电  鞍山市交通局公路处路政科干部郭景孝玩忽职守，擅自关闭唐家房钢厂的水泵开关，造成平炉水包、炉体内局部爆炸的恶性事故， 直接经济损失达３４万元，近日被依法逮捕。
    ５２岁的郭景孝今年５月１１日随鞍山市旧堡区交通管理部门到唐家房镇检查公路路障情况。中午在饭店吃喝后，下午２时许一行１３人乘３台小车来到唐家房钢厂。郭景孝认为钢厂搭在公路和河套中间靠路边一侧的水泵站是违章物，就走过去把正工作的水泵控制电钮关闭。泵房工人发现水泵停转，立即出来问：“谁停的泵？”郭景孝指着自己鼻尖高声说：“我！”“水泵停了，炉就塌呀！”“塌不塌我不管！”虽经多方劝阻，郭景孝仍固执己见，拒绝开泵，眼睁睁地看着炼钢平炉炉体发生了局部爆炸。郭景孝见状不妙，急忙驱车扬长而去。
    昔日喷出腾腾烈焰的炼钢炉已化为断垣；６吨多钢铁原料凝固炉膛中；１００多名工人被迫放了长假，销路畅通的钢产品无法生产。职工们气愤地说：郭景孝如此耍特权，哪像是共产党的干部！
