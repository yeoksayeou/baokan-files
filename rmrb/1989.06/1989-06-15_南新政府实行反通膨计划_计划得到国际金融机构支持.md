The main contents of this plan include liberalization policies in many areas such as prices, imports, and wages, utilizing a unified market mechanism to enable economic entities to operate independently and improve economic efficiency through competition; taking measures to reduce the economic burden on enterprises; strengthening fiscal discipline, and restoring control and regulation of currency circulation.
