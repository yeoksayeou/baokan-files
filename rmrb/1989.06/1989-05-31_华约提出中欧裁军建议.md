　　华约提出中欧裁军建议
    新华社维也纳５月３０日电  华沙条约组织今天在维也纳欧洲常规军备谈判中又提出一项关于华约和北约驻中欧常规军力最高限额的新建议。
    根据这一建议，华约和北约在中欧的常规军力不得超过５７万士兵、４２０架战术战斗机、８００架战斗直升机、８７００辆坦克、７６００门火炮和１４５００辆装甲车辆。华约和北约要在１９９６至１９９７年实现以上限额。
    民主德国首席谈判代表恩斯特今天说，建议中所提中欧在华约方面指民主德国、捷克斯洛伐克、波兰和匈牙利，在北约方面指西德、荷兰、比利时、卢森堡和丹麦。
    恩斯特指出，根据以上规定限额，华约组织必须把其驻这一地区的常规军力裁减近一半。另外，恩斯特还透露，由参加谈判的双方代表和专家们组成的工作小组将具体讨论以上武器种类、数字调整和交流情况等问题。
