    Stopping the Slide in Fiscal Revenue
    Guizhou Requires Strengthening Tax Collection and Management

    GUANGYANG, May 31 (Xinhua) -- This year, Guizhou Province has seen a significant decline in fiscal revenue. As of mid-May, the province's fiscal revenue only completed 20.21% of the annual budget, a 20.43% decrease compared to the same period last year. This decline is the most severe since the "Sixth Five-Year Plan."

    According to relevant departments, the main reasons for the severe drop in fiscal revenue are as follows: First, enterprises are experiencing poor economic performance, leading to a significant increase in tax arrears. Incomplete statistics show that from January to April, enterprises in the province owed nearly 400 million yuan in product taxes. Second, banks are facing a shortage of funds, making it difficult to collect taxes. Third, tax laws are not strictly enforced, and tax collection and management are weak, resulting in significant tax evasion and arrears. According to statistics from 17 enterprises in Guiyang City, each enterprise owes an average of over 12 million yuan in taxes.

    The leadership of the Guizhou Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government has demanded that all departments, units, and enterprises strengthen their sense of the overall situation, prioritize the larger picture, and ensure national fiscal revenue. At the same time, they have required tax departments to strengthen tax collection and management, resolutely enforce tax laws, and conduct tax inspections. They must strictly handle any taxpayer who violates tax laws according to the law.

　　制止财政收入滑坡现象
    贵州要求强化税收征管
    本报贵阳５月３１日电  记者潘帝都报道：今年以来，贵州省财政收入大幅度滑坡。截至５月上旬，全省财政收入仅完成年度预算的２０．２１％，比去年同期下降２０．４３％，下降幅度之大是该省“六五”以来所没有的。
    据有关部门分析，贵州财政收入出现如此严重下滑的主要原因，一是企业经济效益不佳，欠税大幅度增加。据不完全统计，１至４月，全省企业新欠产品税近４亿元。二是银行资金紧缺，税款入库难度加剧。三是依法治税不严，征管工作不力，漏欠税严重。仅据贵阳市１７家企业统计，平均每家欠税达１２０多万元。
    贵州省委、省政府领导要求各部门、单位、企业增强全局观念，小局服从大局，确保国家财政收入。同时，要求税务部门强化税收征管工作，坚决按税法规定，开展税收大检查，依法征税。对违反税法规定的任何纳税义务人，都要按税法规定给予严肃处理。
