People's Daily, Zhengzhou, June 3rd. Reporter Li Erliang reports: Henan Province, which has suffered from the "tobacco leaf war" for two consecutive years, has come up with a set of stringent measures to prevent the "war" from resuming as the tobacco leaf purchasing season approaches.

Henan Province, known as the "Kingdom of Tobacco Leaves," is an important tobacco leaf production base in China. The "tobacco leaf war" over the past two years has caused the state to suffer severe economic losses. The malicious behaviors of upgrading and price hikes, as well as the mixing of fake products that emerged during the "war," have greatly damaged Henan's tobacco leaf reputation and shrunk its market.

This year, Henan's tobacco leaves are growing well, and a bumper harvest is in sight. Will it be dragged into the "war" again? Henan Province has recently taken measures, showing a firm determination to address the root causes: First, cancel all regulations that reward or penalize based on quantity, and implement a "quality veto power." All tobacco leaf purchasing stations (points) must not engage in tobacco leaf trading and must not operate independently, but they must implement a target management responsibility system. Establish provincial, municipal, and county-level quality supervision organizations and implement a purchasing quality responsibility system. If any level has problems, the leaders and inspectors of that level will be held accountable. Second, strictly enforce the tobacco leaf production and purchasing contract system. Any purchasing without a contract will be considered as hoarding, and the "tobacco leaf purchasing permit" will be revoked. The bank will stop issuing purchasing loans, and the station manager will be dismissed. The responsibility of the superior leaders will also be investigated. Third, comprehensive management, and the role of legal departments. Public security, industry and commerce, taxation, price, and tobacco departments will work closely together to severely crack down on illegal business activities. Those who do not follow the national standards and price policies for tobacco leaves, engage in overpriced purchasing or hoarding, do not follow national standards, accept "favor tobacco" and "backdoor tobacco," accept mixed and fake tobacco leaves, collude internally and externally, engage in corruption and bribery, and deceive users by upgrading and increasing prices, will be penalized according to the law depending on the severity of their actions.

    采取措施避免新的损失
    河南防止“烟叶大战”重起
    本报郑州6月3日电　记者李而亮报道：连续两年深受“烟叶大战”之苦的河南省，在即将到来的烟叶收购季节拿出一套强硬措施，防止“大战”再度发生。
    享有“烟叶王国”之称的河南省，是我国重要的烟叶生产基地。近两年的“烟叶大战”，使国家在经济上蒙受严重损失，在“大战”中引发出来的提级提价、掺杂兑假等恶劣行为，也使河南省烟叶信誉大降、市场萎缩。
    今年，河南烟叶长势良好，丰收在望，会不会再度卷入“大战”之中？河南省最近采取措施，显示了治本的坚定决心：一、取消一切以数量论奖罚的规定，实行“质量否决权”。所有烟叶收购站（点），一律不得经营烟叶，也不得搞独立核算，但要实行目标管理责任制；建立省、地、县三级质量监督组织，实行收购质量负责制，哪一级出了问题，追查哪一级领导和检验人员的责任。二、严格烟叶生产收购合同制。凡无合同收购的，均视为抢购，要吊销其“烟叶收购许可证”，银行停发收购贷款，撤销收购站站长职务，追究上级领导责任。三、综合治理，发挥法律部门的职能。公安、工商、税务、物价、烟草部门密切配合，严厉打击非法经营活动。对不执行烟叶国家标准和价格政策，加价收购、抢购者，对不执行国家标准、收“人情烟”和“后门烟”、收掺杂兑假烟叶、内外勾结、贪污受贿、提级上调欺骗用户的检验人员，都要视其情节，依法制裁。
