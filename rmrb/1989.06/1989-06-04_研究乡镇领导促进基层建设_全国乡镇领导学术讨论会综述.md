In April, a national academic symposium on township leadership was held in Qingzhou, Shandong Province. The symposium was organized by the Organization Department of the Shandong Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the Leadership Science Press, the Qingzhou Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, and the municipal government. The conference focused on the position, characteristics, problems, and countermeasures of township leadership work.

	The Importance of Studying Township Leadership Work

Townships are the basic units of political power, community systems, and comprehensive economic entities in China. They play a crucial role in China's socialist construction and development. Over the past decade of reform, we have achieved significant successes, but we have also encountered problems such as agricultural decline, educational crises, and uncontrolled population growth. Representatives at the symposium believed that, apart from certain policy mistakes, neglecting and relaxing grassroots construction is a significant factor. In a country where 80% of the population lives in rural areas, the most important grassroots level is the township. Therefore, we must pay attention to township construction, and strengthening and improving township leadership work is the key.

Township leadership work has its unique laws compared to leadership work at other levels and sequences. With the deepening of rural reforms, township leadership work has encountered many new situations and problems. Adapting to new situations and solving new problems requires special work methods. However, the study of township leadership work is still weak. To date, there are no specialized research institutions or academic activities, which is unacceptable. Only by seriously studying the laws of township leadership work and exploring methods for township leadership work can we strengthen and improve township leadership work.

	Characteristics of Township Leadership Work and the Qualities and Methods of Its Cadres

In China's leadership system, township leadership work is a level between macro and micro leadership, which can be called "meso" leadership. Representatives pointed out that township leadership work has four characteristics: First, compared to county-level and above party and government leadership work, township leadership work has a more concrete and specific nature. County-level and above leadership organs mainly provide guiding principles, while township leadership work requires concrete command. Party policies and state laws and regulations must be implemented by township leaders, and villages, enterprises, and mass organizations, as well as farmers, rely on township leaders to solve difficult and miscellaneous issues. Second, compared to county-level departments, township leadership work has a more comprehensive community nature. County-level departments have specialized leadership, while township leadership work is comprehensive. Townships have party, government, mass, and enterprise organizations; industries include agriculture, industry, commerce, construction, transportation, services, and more; work includes political power construction, economic work, ideological education, population management, social stability, culture and education, science and technology promotion, sports and health, and village and town construction, so township leadership work must be comprehensively managed and coordinated. Third, compared to village party branches and village committees, township leadership work has a more complex nature of overlapping jurisdictions. Townships have multiple supervisory bodies above them. Fourth, compared to enterprises and public institutions, township leadership work has a more unified nature of party and government. Enterprises and public institutions have already implemented or are implementing the separation of party and government, with clear division of responsibilities, while township party committees and governments often handle everything at once, going down to handle everything and then dividing responsibilities upon return.

Given the above characteristics of township leadership work, there are special requirements for the qualities and work methods of township leadership cadres. Regarding the qualities of township leadership cadres, some representatives believe that township leaders should have a people-first mindset, a spirit of dedication, a practical style, a clean and diligent character, a decisive style, a coordinating art, and innovative abilities. Other representatives pointed out that township leaders should have a thinking mode that combines macro and micro perspectives, a work method that combines leniency and strictness, and a broad and accurate knowledge structure.

Regarding the work methods of township leadership cadres, some representatives believe that in terms of basic responsibilities, they should, under the premise of implementing the policies, laws, and regulations of the party and government at higher levels, do a good job of service, guidance, organization, and coordination. In terms of work methods, some representatives pointed out that they should center around service, using policy levers, legal levers, economic levers, and information levers together; in terms of work means, some representatives pointed out that they should achieve three transformations: from a single administrative management type to a service management type, from a uniform model of "one-size-fits-all" to a diversified approach tailored to local conditions, and from general calls and empty gestures to practical work and effectiveness.

	The Causes and Countermeasures of Difficulties in Township Leadership Work

Many representatives believe that the current period is the most difficult time for township leadership work since the founding of the nation. Representatives generally agreed on the main difficulties in township leadership work. They felt that the most troublesome and thorny issues were mainly in family planning, funeral reforms, levies and fund-raising, and village and town planning. These "inextricable" issues not only consume the main time and energy of township leaders but are also important causes of tense relations between officials and the masses.

Representatives believed that the main causes of difficulties in township leadership work are: the contradiction between frequently changing macro decisions and the need for consistent implementation at the grassroots level; the contradiction between large responsibilities and limited powers; the contradiction between promoting certain work and traditional concepts of the masses; the contradiction between "hard" task indicators and "soft" policy regulations, etc.

How to solve the difficulties in township leadership work? Representatives suggested that the following two aspects should be addressed. First, simplify administration and promote the reform of the township leadership management system, i.e., clarify the relationship between the party and the government. The conditions for separating the party and government at the township level do not seem to be mature, so the unified leadership of the township party committee should be clarified; streamline the relationship between vertical and horizontal management, and it seems that personnel, financial, and material powers should be given to townships, and relevant business work should be changed from vertical management by county-level departments to "block" management by townships. Second, adjust unreasonable policies and improve legal regulations. In agricultural production, it is necessary to implement a comprehensive investment of funds, talents, and technology to ensure stable agricultural growth; in township enterprises, it is necessary to carry out rectification and reorganization under the premise of supporting the strong and eliminating the weak; in family planning, relevant laws and regulations should be formulated and issued as soon as possible; in levies and fund-raising, it should be changed from arbitrary collection to fixed taxation. In short, through the gradual improvement of policies and laws, the scientific management of township leadership work can be promoted.

　　研究乡镇领导促进基层建设
    ——全国乡镇领导学术讨论会综述
    ４月间，由中共山东省委组织部、领导科学报社、中共青州市委和市政府等单位发起的全国乡镇领导学术讨论会，在山东省青州市召开。会议围绕乡镇领导工作的地位、特点、问题及对策等展开了讨论。
    　　　　要重视乡镇领导工作的研究
    乡镇是我国基层政权组织、基本社区系统和综合经济单位，它在我国社会主义建设与发展中具有十分重要的地位和作用。十年改革，我们取得了很大的成绩，也出现了一些问题，诸如农业滑坡、教育危机、人口失控等。代表们认为，究其原因，除了决策的某些失误之外，忽视和放松基层建设是一个重要方面。在我们这样一个８０％人口在农村的国家中，最重要的基层是乡镇。所以，必须重视乡镇建设，而加强和改善乡镇领导工作，就是关键所在。
    乡镇领导工作与其他层次和序列的领导工作相比，有其特殊的规律。随着农村改革的深化，乡镇领导工作出现了大量的新情况、新问题。适应新情况、解决新问题，就需要特殊的工作方法。但是，乡镇领导工作的研究还很薄弱，迄今既没有专门的研究机构，也没有专门的学术活动，这是很不应该的。只有认真研究乡镇领导工作的规律，探讨乡镇领导工作的方法，才能加强和改善乡镇领导工作。
    　　　　乡镇领导工作的特点及其干部素养与工作方法
    在我国领导系统中，乡镇领导工作是介于宏观领导与微观领导之间的一个层次，可称为“中观”领导。代表们指出，乡镇领导工作的特点表现在四个方面：一是与县以上党政领导工作比，乡镇领导工作具有基层具体性。县以上领导机关的工作多为原则性指导，而乡镇领导工作必须具体性指挥，党的方针政策和国家的法律、政令要由乡镇领导贯彻落实，村和企事业单位及农民群众的难事、杂事得靠乡镇领导处理解决。二是与县直部门比，乡镇领导工作具有社区综合性。县直部门的工作属于专业领导，而乡镇领导工作是全面领导。乡镇组织上党、政、群、企事业都有；行业上农、工、商、建、交通、服务俱全；工作上政权建设、经济工作、思想教育、人口管理、民政治安、文化教育、科技推广、文体卫生、村镇建设并存，所以，乡镇领导工作必须综合治理，协调发展。三是与村党支部和村民委员会相比，乡镇领导工作具有条块的交叉性。乡镇党委和政府上面，政出多门、婆婆众多。四是与企事业单位相比，乡镇领导工作具有党政一体性。企事业单位已经和正在实行党政分开，党政职有专司，各尽其责，而乡镇党委和政府往往是“一揽子”工作，“下去一把抓，回来再分家”。
    鉴于上述乡镇领导工作的特点，对乡镇领导干部的素质修养和工作方法就有着特殊的要求。关于乡镇领导干部的素质修养，有的代表认为，乡镇领导干部要有为民观念、献身精神、务实作风、廉勤本色、果敢风格、协调艺术、创新能力。有的代表指出，乡镇领导干部要有宏观与微观结合的思维方式，宽严并济的工作方法，广博准确的知识结构。
    关于乡镇领导干部的工作方法，在基本职责上，有的代表认为，要在贯彻执行上级党和政府的方针、政策、法律、政令的前提下，做好服务、指导、组织、协调工作。在工作方式上，有的代表指出，要以服务为中心，实行政策杠杆、法律杠杆、经济杠杆、信息杠杆多管齐下；在工作手段上，有的代表指出，要实现三个转变，即由单一的行政管理型向服务管理型转变，由统一模式“一刀切”向因地制宜多样化转变，由一般号召摆花架子向深入实际讲究实效转变。
    　　　　乡镇领导工作困难的成因与对策
    许多代表认为，目前乡镇领导工作是建国以来最难干的时期。代表们对乡镇领导工作主要困难的看法基本一致。大家感到最头痛和最棘手的大都在计划生育、殡葬改革、提留集资、村镇规划等工作上。这些“剪不断，理还乱”的事情，既消耗着乡镇领导的主要时间和精力，也是造成干群关系紧张的重要原因。
    代表们认为，乡镇领导工作困难的成因主要是：宏观决策多变与基层执行不走样的矛盾；岗位职责大与现有权力小的矛盾；倡导推行的某些工作与群众传统观念的矛盾；任务指标“硬”与政策规范“软”的矛盾等。
    如何解决乡镇领导的困难？代表们建议，目前应着力解决如下两个方面的问题。首先，要简政放权，大力推进乡镇领导管理体制改革，即：明确党政关系，乡镇党政分开的条件似不成熟，应该明确乡镇党委一元化领导的制度；理顺条块关系，似应将人财物实权放给乡镇，将有关业务工作变县直部门条块管理为乡镇“块块”管理。其次，调整不合理的政策，完善法律规范。在农业生产方面，要切实实行资金、人才、科技“三位一体”的倾斜投入，保证农业生产的稳定增长；乡镇企业方面，要在扶优压劣的前提下进行治理整顿；计划生育方面，应该尽快制订并出台有关法律法令；提留集资方面，应该变随意性征敛为固定性税收等。总之，要通过政策法律的逐步完善，促进乡镇领导工作的科学化。（彭树人）
