	The Canvas of History
	—A Review of "Dawn of a New Era"
		Jian Xian Ai

	In the early 1950s, Shi Guo published a series of short stories in "People's Literature," including "Storm," "Happy Times," and "Official Blessings," which earned him a reputation in the literary world. After publishing his short story collection "Collection of Joyful Winds" in 1983, he remained silent for five years. Recently, he has returned with a 380,000-word novel, "Dawn of a New Era," which is the first part of his trilogy "The Saga of Turmoil." This novel can be seen as a historical canvas of the decade before and after the founding of the nation.

	After reading the first part, "Dawn of a New Era," it left a very deep impression on me. Since the author writes about the brutal class struggles and the dramatic social changes of that era in my hometown, the characters are vivid, and the details are very authentic, making me feel particularly close to it. Shi Guo was born and raised in Guilin, so he is very familiar with the local customs and traditions. In the 1930s, he participated in the Red Army and fought as a guerrilla, and later engaged in underground work, interacting with various types of people, accumulating a wealth of life experiences. He writes with ease and confidence, displaying a broad and profound style. The author excels in portraying characters from various strata of large families. In the book, he not only sketches the scenes of the era but also depicts the appearance and spiritual state of some oppressed peasants who have a higher level of awareness. He uses a network-like approach, writing about the Jinlong and two large families and various types of characters, totaling over two hundred, with intense and complex struggles; initially, it may seem confusing, but upon careful reading, it becomes clear and well-organized. He created two female characters: one is Xu Ruanshu, who hides her identity as an underground party leader by posing as a nun in an ancient temple, deep and reserved; the other is Ling Feifei, the daughter of a hunter named Ling Yunshan, who is intelligent, straightforward, and an excellent marksman. Through the party's cultivation and short-term training, she quickly grew and participated in battles, becoming a simple and lovable young woman.

	The cunning and viciousness of the fake councilor Jin Runan, although mentioned, I believe it could be delved into more deeply. Although Li Yangtun is a small town, it is also the base of those officials and gentry. There should be an intense battle there, but the author only mentions its destruction, which is somewhat brief.

	"Dawn of a New Era" contains some dialect, which naturally highlights the thick local flavor and emphasizes the characters' personalities; however, it may also limit the readership. Some obscure dialects from Sichuan and Guizhou are not annotated, and many readers may not understand them.

	In my opinion, Shi Guo's novel does not follow trends or chase fads but maintains his original personal style, which is also commendable.

　　历史的画卷
    ——喜读《拂晓时节》
    蹇先艾
    五十年代早期，在《人民文学》连续发表《风波》《喜期》《官福店》等短篇小说而饮誉文坛的石果同志１９８３年出版了他的短篇小说集《喜风集》后，沉默了五年之久，最近又以３８万言的长篇《拂晓时节》与读者见面了（重庆出版社出版）。这是他的沧桑三部曲之一。像这样的长篇，可谓建国前后十年的历史画卷。
    读了第一部《拂晓时节》以后，它给我留下了极为深刻的印象。由于他所写的都是我的家乡那个时期残酷的阶级斗争与社会的翻天覆地的变化，人物形象鲜明，细节也很真实，使我感到分外亲切。石果生在贵林，长在贵林，对黔北民情风俗既然熟悉，加上３０年代曾经参加过红军，打过游击，后来接着又搞地下工作，和诸色人等都有接触，积累了种种宝贵的生活经验，写起来得心应手，显得大气磅礴，有一定的广度深度。作者以写大家族各阶层的人物见长，在书中不仅勾勒了时代的画面，而且刻画了一些受压迫最深，觉悟较高的农民的风貌和精神状态。他采取了网状式的手法，写金龙两个大家族及各种类型的人物，多到两百余人，斗争剧烈，错综复杂；初读时也许会感到眼花缭乱，细加咀嚼，又觉得头头是道，脉络分明。他塑造了两个妇女形象：一个是以古庙尼姑来隐藏地下党领导者身分的徐宛如（慧敏），深藏者虚，遇事持重；一个是打山匠（猎人）凌云山的女儿凌飞飞，心思聪明，性情直爽，枪法超群，通过党的培养，经过短期锻炼，参加战斗，成长得相当迅速，是一个朴实可爱的女青年。
    伪参议长金如楠的阴险毒辣，诡计多端，虽然写到了一些，我认为还可以挖得深一点。黎阳屯虽然是一个小场镇，但又是那些官绅的根据地，双方应当在那里有一场激烈的战斗，作者只提到它的被烧毁，未免失之简略。
    《拂晓时节》中方言稍多，好处自然是表现了浓厚的地方色采，突出了人物的性格；但也可能会缩小读者面，有些川黔生僻的方言，没有注释，有很多读者往往就看不懂。
    我个人认为石果同志的这个长篇，不趋时，不赶浪潮，仍然保持着他原来个人的风格，这一点也是难能可贵的。
