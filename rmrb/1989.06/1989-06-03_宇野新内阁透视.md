Title: Insight into the New Ueno Cabinet

The new Japanese cabinet led by Ueno Sozo, the 13th president of the Liberal Democratic Party, was formed last night and held its appointment and certification ceremony at the Imperial Palace today, marking the official birth of the Ueno cabinet.

From a macro perspective, the birth of the Ueno cabinet was a difficult process fraught with twists and turns. From a micro perspective, it was swift and decisive. Since Prime Minister Takeshita announced his intention to step down on April 25, the search for a successor began. Due to differing political views, the initial candidate, Ito Seiji, declined to take the position, leading to multiple rounds of negotiations that lasted a month. On May 25, Prime Minister Takeshita personally intervened, and the seasoned politician indeed proved his mettle. A week later, Ueno was pushed to the prime minister's seat.

As a candidate for the prime minister's position, Ueno Sozo was not initially on the list. After being suddenly proposed on May 27, people were first taken aback, but upon reflection, it seemed "natural." The reasons can be divided into two aspects. The most obvious reason is that Ueno meets the primary condition for the successor to the prime minister—he is unrelated to the Recruit scandal, has a clean image, is a powerful figure within the Liberal Democratic Party, has served in multiple cabinets, is well-versed in policy, and has some leadership ability. With the summit of Western countries scheduled for mid-July in Paris approaching, Ueno is skilled in diplomacy and has a certain level of international recognition, making him a suitable representative for Japan. Behind the scenes, Ueno is neither an elder statesman nor a young politician, which avoids criticism of being "old-fashioned" or "inexperienced," making it easier to gain the approval of the business community. Secondly, according to the Liberal Democratic Party's "seniority system," the 66-year-old Ueno's position as prime minister is beneficial for transitioning to several party colleagues who are eyeing the prime minister's seat.

Although Ueno's candidacy was swift, he still faced strong opposition within and outside the party. The issue is that Ueno belongs to the Nakasone faction within the Liberal Democratic Party, and the stock market scandal during Nakasone's administration is well-known. Former Prime Minister Fukuda Takeo sarcastically referred to Ueno as the "managing director of Nakasone Inc.," stating that Ueno's appointment is a challenge to the national sentiment. Young lawmakers within the party formed the "Liberal Reform Alliance" and proposed their own candidate to challenge Ueno. The opposition parties criticized Ueno's cabinet as a "neo-Nakasone regime." People expressed great dissatisfaction with the "backroom politics" of selecting a new prime minister through behind-the-scenes deals.

Despite this, the formation of the Ueno cabinet is a fait accompli. From the process of Ueno's cabinet formation and its composition, there are notable changes: Firstly, Ueno stated that he would no longer allocate positions based on the lists provided by various factions within the party. Secondly, cabinet members are not primarily selected from the leaders of various factions within the party. Thirdly, the cabinet members are noticeably younger. The average age is 59.48 years old, which is 6 years younger than the previous cabinet. The youngest minister is 40 years old, and a post-war-born individual has entered the cabinet for the first time. In addition to the notable changes, there are also aspects that adhere to tradition: Although Ueno stated that he would not allocate positions based on the lists provided by various factions within the party, the composition of the cabinet members is still a product of seat allocation based on the strength of various factions within the party. The cabinet includes 6 members from the Takeshita faction, 5 from the Miyazawa faction, 4 from the Abe faction, 3 from the Nakasone faction, 1 from the Kawamoto faction, and 1 from the Nikaido faction. It is almost a replica of the "factional balance" composition of the previous cabinet, which is a unique deformity of Japanese Liberal Democratic Party politics. Secondly, similar to the relationship between the Nakasone cabinet and the Takeshita cabinet, the former prime minister's influence on the production and future direction of the new cabinet is significant, and the transition from Takeshita to Ueno is no exception. Public opinion believes that the Ueno cabinet will rely on the "Takeshita administration."

Regarding the immediate tasks after the formation of the Ueno cabinet, there is no significant disagreement. The most important domestic issue is political reform. Changing the status quo where factional dynamics dominate politics, eradicating the breeding ground for money politics, and restoring the public's trust in politics is not an easy task for the Ueno cabinet. The House of Councillors election in late July is also a severe test for the Ueno cabinet. A reduction in the Liberal Democratic Party's seats is inevitable, and how to reduce the extent of the seat reduction through convincing achievements, and how the effectiveness of political reform will be interdependent. The main diplomatic issue is also evident. To ease the renewed tension in Japan-U.S. economic friction and strengthen the alliance between the two countries, Ueno has begun preparations for his visit to the United States later this month. The summit of Western leaders in mid-July is an important opportunity for Ueno to make his debut on the international political stage as the prime minister of Japan. How to propose new policies that are beneficial for the international community to understand Japan, and how to present a new image of "Japan contributing to the world" in the increasingly tense international trade relations, the Ueno cabinet faces numerous challenges.

According to the established political schedule, the Ueno cabinet is a transitional government, with its term ending in late October. Regarding whether he intends to seek re-election, Ueno avoided answering. It is clear that whether he can seek re-election does not depend on Ueno's will, but his performance does. It is said that Ueno can play the piano, and people hope that he will play a new melody on the piano of Japanese politics, rather than repeating old tunes.

    宇野新内阁透视
    本报记者　于青
    以自民党第13届总裁宇野宗佑为首的日本新内阁于昨晚组成，今天在皇宫举行了任命和认证仪式，宇野内阁正式诞生。
    宇野内阁的问世，从宏观来看是历经波折的难产，从微观看是速战速决。自4月25日竹下首相表示有意引退之后，就开始物色继任人选。由于政见相左，最初的候选人伊东正义拒绝接任，为此多次反复，耗时一月之久。5月25日，竹下首相亲自出马斡旋，谙熟内政的竹下果然身手不凡，一周之后，就把宇野推上首相宝座。
    作为首相继任候选人，宇野宗佑本来榜上无名，5月27日被突然提出后，人们先是大吃一惊，细想之后也觉“顺理成章”。究其原委，可分表面两个方面。堂而皇之的理由是，宇野符合继任首相的首要条件——与利库路特事件无关，形象清廉，是自民党内实力人物，多次入阁，精通政策，有一定领导能力；7月中旬在巴黎举行的西方国家首脑会谈临近，宇野擅长外交，在国际上有一定知名度，是代表日本的合适人物。幕后的内情是，宇野既非长老型，也非少壮型，可避免“老气横秋”和“嘴上无毛”之类的指责，容易得到财界的首肯。其二是，按自民党内的“年功序列制”，66岁的宇野位居首相，有利用向几位伺机当上首相的党内同代实力人物过渡。
    虽然宇野出马是速战速决的，在党内外还是遇到了意外的强烈反对。问题在于宇野在自民党内属于中曾根派，而中曾根执政期间发生的股票丑闻已尽人皆知。前首相福田赳夫辛辣地把宇野喻为“中曾根商社的专务理事”，直言宇野出任是对国民感情的挑战。党内少壮派议员组成的“自由革新联盟”，提出自己选出的总裁候选人与之分庭抗礼。在野党指责宇野组阁将是“亚中曾根流政权”。人们对经过幕后交易选定新首相的“密室政治”表示极大不满。
    尽管如此，宇野内阁出台已是既成事实。从宇野组阁过程和内阁构成看，有显著变化的一面：首先是宇野表示不再根据党内各派提供的人选名单搭配；其次是，内阁成员不是优先从党内各派系头目中选拔；其三是，内阁成员明显年轻化。平均年龄59.48岁，比前内阁年轻6岁。最年轻的大臣40岁，战后出生的人物首次入阁。除显著变化的一面，还有墨守成规的一面：虽然宇野表示不按党内各派提供的人选名单搭配，但内阁成员构成仍然是按党内各派实力分配座席的产物。内阁中竹下派6人，宫泽派5人，安倍派4人，中曾根3人，河本派1人，二阶堂派1人。几乎是前内阁“派系均衡”构成的翻版，这是日本自民党政治特有的畸型病。其次是，与中曾根内阁和竹下内阁更迭时的关系一样，前内阁首脑对新内阁首脑的产生和日后走向都有举足轻重的影响，竹下和宇野的交替也是如此。舆论认为，宇野内阁将依赖于“竹下院政”。
    对于宇野内阁成立后当务之急的认识，并不存在大的分歧。内政最重要的课题是政治改革。改变派系力学左右政治的现状，铲除金权政治的温床，恢复国民对政治的信任，对宇野内阁来说颇不轻松。7月下旬的参院选举对宇野内阁也是一次严峻考验。自民党议席减少将不可避免，怎样通过有说服力的政绩，缩小议席减少的幅度，与政治改革的成效如何互为因果。外交的主要课题也是显而易见。为缓和再度紧张的日美经济摩擦，加强两国的同盟关系，宇野已开始准备本月下旬出访美国。7月中旬的西方首脑会谈，是宇野作为日本首相首次在国际政治舞台上表现的重要机会。如何提出有利于国际社会理解日本的新决策，如何在日趋紧张的国际贸易关系中，以新的形象体现“为世界做出贡献的日本”，宇野内阁面临为数众多的难题。
    按既定的政治日程，宇野内阁是过渡性政权，任期到10月底止。对是否有意连任，宇野避而不答。事情很明显，能否连任不取决于宇野的意愿，但政绩如何，则取决于宇野的努力。据说宇野会弹钢琴，人们期待他对日本政治这架钢琴弹奏出新的乐章，而不是老调重弹。
