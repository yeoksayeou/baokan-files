    French professor Ned Guedon of the Paris Institute of Social Sciences announced in early June in Sao Paulo, Brazil, that scientific analysis of artifacts unearthed during archaeological excavations indicates that humans were active in the Americas at least 48,500 years ago.

    According to Agence France-Presse, Professor Guedon is currently collaborating with archaeologists from the University of Campinas in Brazil on this research. Over the past decade, they have unearthed primitive tools used by ancient humans, including polished stone tools and many drawings similar to those found in the Altamira Cave in Spain.

    These artifacts were tested using the carbon-14 dating method at the Paris Micro-Radiation Center laboratory. The results indicate that humans inhabited the state of Piaui in Brazil as early as 48,500 years ago.

　　美洲四万八千多年前有人类居住
    法国巴黎社会科学研究所教授尼埃德·吉东６月上旬在巴西圣保罗市宣布，经过对考古发掘出土物的科学测定结果表明，美洲至少在４８５００年前就开始有人类活动。
    据法新社报道，吉东教授目前正同巴西坎皮纳斯大学的考古人员一起从事这项研究工作。１０年来，他们发掘出古人类用过的原始工具，其中有经琢磨过的石器、磨光的石质工具，以及发现许多与西班牙的阿尔塔米拉洞穴中的壁画相类似的绘画。
    这些发掘物经巴黎微放射中心实验室运用碳１４测量法进行测定后，人们得出的结论表明，巴西皮奥伊州在４８５００年前就有人类居住了。
