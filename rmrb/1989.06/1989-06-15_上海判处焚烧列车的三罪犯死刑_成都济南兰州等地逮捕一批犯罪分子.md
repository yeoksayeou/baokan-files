Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 15th

Shanghai Intermediate People's Court today handed down a first-instance verdict, sentencing criminals Xu Guoming, Bian Hanwu, and Yan Xuehong to death and depriving them of political rights for life for their roles in the severe disturbance at the Guangxin Road railway crossing, where they set fire to trains, wantonly destroyed transportation vehicles and facilities. From June 6th to the early morning of June 7th, Xu Guoming, a contract worker at the Shanghai Brewery, Bian Hanwu, an unemployed individual, and Yan Xuehong, a worker at Shanghai Radio Factory No. 18, along with other thugs, took advantage of a traffic accident at the Guangxin Road railway crossing in Shanghai to create a shocking and severe disturbance. These thugs brazenly smashed and burned train carriages and police motorcycles, destroyed transportation facilities, obstructed firefighters from extinguishing the fire, assaulted public security and firefighting personnel, resulting in the destruction of 9 train carriages, 6 police motorcycles, and over 900 mailbags. A large amount of firefighting equipment was looted and destroyed, dozens of public security and firefighting personnel were injured, causing direct economic losses of nearly 3 million yuan to the state. Railway transportation was disrupted for nearly 50 hours, and over 500 freight and passenger trains were halted.

Our reporter in Chengdu, Luo Mao Cheng, reports: As of yesterday, Chengdu Public Security Bureau has lawfully arrested over 40 criminals involved in arson, looting, and vandalism.

From June 4th to 7th, a small group of lawless elements in Chengdu, in response to the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, frantically stormed party and government offices, assaulted on-duty armed police officers, smashed cars, destroyed transportation facilities, looted and burned shops, hotels, and cinemas, causing severe damage to state property and seriously threatening the lives and property of the people.

Our reporter in Jinan, June 15th: A counter-revolutionary organization with a manifesto, premeditated plans, and destructive activities—“Jinan City Federation of Self-Governance”—was lawfully disbanded by Jinan Public Security Bureau today. The leaders Liu Yubin, Che Hongyuan, and core members Zhang Xinchang, Shao Liangchen, and Hao Jinliang, who refused to register and surrender, have been apprehended.

Investigations revealed that this illegal organization was formed by the merger of the “Jinan City Workers' Self-Governance Federation” and the “Jinan City Workers' Democratic Federation.” Its reactionary manifesto aims to “seize power by force, overthrow the government,” planning to “establish underground armed forces in cities, build bases and guerrilla forces in rural areas, seek overseas economic and military aid,” and “launch guerrilla warfare in urban areas, seize weapons from the military” to achieve the goal of overthrowing the people's democratic dictatorship.

Our reporter in Lanzhou, June 15th: Since the Gansu Provincial Government’s announcement on June 12th, leaders of illegal student organizations in Lanzhou’s colleges and universities have begun to register with the Public Security Bureau. As of yesterday afternoon at 5:30 PM, 9 individuals have registered at the Municipal Public Security Bureau.

Five leaders of illegal student organizations from Northwest Normal University registered at the Municipal Public Security Bureau on June 12th, accompanied by teachers and security personnel from the school.

Our reporter in Nanchang, June 15th: Recently, the Nanchang Public Security Bureau has lawfully disbanded the illegal organization “Nanchang United Workers' Union.” The main leaders and core members of this illegal organization have been detained for investigation.

After the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, some individuals in Nanchang openly raised the banner of the “United Workers' Union,” inciting work stoppages and production halts, and spreading rumors. Upon investigation, the leaders of this illegal organization include those who have previously committed crimes and received administrative detention, re-education through labor, and detention; those who harbor resentment towards society and collude with enemy spy agencies; those who are lazy and engage in fraud; and those who oppose the four cardinal principles and vigorously advocate for bourgeois liberalization.
