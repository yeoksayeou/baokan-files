People's Daily reports: The first mainland Chinese film adaptation of a Qiong Yao novel will begin shooting in Hangzhou soon. The movie, based on the novel "Courtyard in the Depths," will be divided into two parts, tentatively titled "Soul of the Ruins" and "After the Storm."

The film is produced by the Shanghai Film Studio and directed by female director Shi Shujun. Shi Shujun previously adapted Qiong Yao's novel "Moonlit Night, Bird in the Mist" into a multi-episode television series. She believes that "Courtyard in the Depths," which depicts the emotional entanglements of middle-aged people, is one of Qiong Yao's novels with the most intricate plot and complex colors, differing from other pure love stories of young girls. Before the adaptation, Shi Shujun met with Qiong Yao twice to discuss the project, aiming to make the future film more profound and distinct from Hong Kong and Taiwan's Qiong Yao films, showcasing mainland characteristics.

　　上影投拍琼瑶电影
    本报讯  大陆投拍的第一部琼瑶电影将于日内在杭州开机，由小说《庭院深深》改编拍摄的上下集电影暂名为《废墟之魂》和《暴风雨后》两部。
    影片为上海电影制片厂投资拍摄，由女导演史蜀君执导。史蜀君曾将琼瑶另一部小说《月朦胧鸟朦胧》改拍为多集电视剧，她认为表现中年人感情纠葛的《庭院深深》是琼瑶小说中情节比较曲折、色彩十分复杂的一部，而不同于另一些纯情少女爱情故事的格局。在改编之前，史蜀君曾两度与琼瑶会晤并作探讨，力图将未来的影片拍得深沉一些，具有不同于港台琼瑶片的大陆特色。
