Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, June 14th

The newly reestablished Polish Writers' Association was approved for registration by the Warsaw Provincial Court on June 14th.

The Polish Writers' Association was suspended in late 1981 when martial law was declared in Poland and was officially disbanded on August 20, 1983.

The Polish Writers' Association was reestablished in the context of Poland's formal declaration of political and social pluralism. It currently has over 500 members and recently held a preparatory congress, during which a board of directors was elected. Jan J. Szczepanski was elected as the chairman of the board.

On the same day, the Polish Union of Visual Artists also regained its registration.

    波兰作家协会是在波兰正式宣布实行政治、社会多元化的背景下重新建立的。它现有会员５００多名，不久前召开了筹建代表大会，会上选出了协会理事会。扬·约·什切潘斯基当选为理事会主席。
    同一天，波兰美术家联合会也重新获得登记。
