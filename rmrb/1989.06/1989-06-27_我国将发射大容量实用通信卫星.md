Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 27th.

China will launch a large-capacity practical communication satellite—“Dongfanghong III” by the end of 1992. The China Satellite Broadcasting Company announced today that the research and development work is progressing smoothly with the support of relevant departments. The funding, usage requirements, overall design plan, and imported projects from abroad have been basically settled. The initial prototype development phase of the satellite has begun.

The Dongfanghong III satellite is designed for domestic communication and television program transmission in China. The satellite is equipped with 24 transponders, capable of simultaneously transmitting 6 channels of color television programs and 15,000 channels of telephone, telegraph, fax, and data signals. Its transmission range will cover the entire Chinese territory, including the South China Sea islands.

According to the development requirements of China's satellite communication system, after the Dongfanghong III is operational, China will launch another identical Dongfanghong IIIB satellite at a later time, positioned at a different orbital location. The two satellites will serve as backups for each other, with unified arrangements for primary and secondary services. When both satellites are operational, they will be able to simultaneously transmit 12 television channels and 30,000 telephone channels.

The Dongfanghong III satellite is primarily developed by research and production units under the Ministry of Aerospace Industry of China, following the principle of "self-reliance with international cooperation." It collaborates extensively with relevant manufacturers from several countries. The satellite adopts many advanced technologies, reaching the international advanced level of the early 1980s. It will be launched to the designated position using China's Long March 3A carrier rocket.

The Dongfanghong III satellite will also be China's first satellite for commercial operation, serving the entire society. After its launch, it will be operated and managed by the China Satellite Broadcasting Company, which will lease its lines to users in broadcasting, television, postal, and educational departments through contractual agreements.

　　我国将发射大容量实用通信卫星
    新华社北京６月２７日电（记者卓培荣）中国广播卫星公司今天在此间宣布：我国将于１９９２年底发射一颗大容量实用通信卫星——“东方红三号卫星”。在使用与研制部门的努力下，目前研制工作进展顺利，经费、使用要求、总体设计方案及国外引进项目已基本落实，已经开始了卫星的初样研制阶段。
    东方红三号卫星是用于我国国内通信和广播电视节目传输的卫星。卫星上装有２４个转发器，能够同时传送６路彩色电视节目和１５０００路电话或电报、传真、数据等信号。它的传输范围将覆盖包括南海诸岛在内的我国全部国土。
    根据中国卫星通信系统发展要求，在东方红三号运行使用以后晚些时候，我国还将发射一颗同它完全相同的东方红三号Ｂ卫星，定点于不同轨道位置。两星互为备份，统一安排主要和次要业务。两星同时开通时，能同时传送１２路电视和３万路电话。
    东方红三号卫星由我国航空航天工业部所属科研生产单位为主研制，本着“以我为主、辅以国际合作”的方针，与一些国家的有关厂商进行广泛合作。卫星采用许多先进技术，达到８０年代初的国际先进水平。将采用我国的长征三号甲运载火箭发射到预定位置定点。
    东方红三号卫星也将是我国第一颗面向全社会的、实行商业化经营的通信卫星。开通以后由中国广播卫星公司经营及运行管理，并采取合同形式把它的线路分别租让给广播、电视、邮电、教育等部门的用户。
