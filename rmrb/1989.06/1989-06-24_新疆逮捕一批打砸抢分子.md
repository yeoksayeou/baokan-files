Urumqi Public Security Bureau today arrested a batch of seven ringleaders and key figures involved in the May 19 political disturbance.

The political disturbance that occurred in Urumqi on May 19 this year was orchestrated by a small group of individuals who harbor hostility towards the Communist Party of China and the socialist system, and who oppose national unity and ethnic harmony. They exploited the already resolved issue of the book "Sexual Customs" to launch a large-scale smashing, looting, and arson campaign against the organs of the Autonomous Region Party Committee, the People's Congress, the Consultative Committee, and the Discipline Inspection Commission. During this disturbance, more than 40 vehicles were destroyed, and over 150 armed police officers, public security personnel, and government employees were injured.

　　新疆逮捕一批打砸抢分子
    新华社乌鲁木齐６月２４日电  乌鲁木齐市公安局今天逮捕一批共７名“５·１９”政治骚乱事件的首恶分子和骨干分子。
    今年５月１９日发生在乌鲁木齐的政治骚乱事件，是一小撮敌视中国共产党和社会主义制度，反对祖国统一和民族团结的人，借已经处理了的《性风俗》一书问题，有组织、有预谋地对自治区党委、人大、顾委会、纪检委机关进行的大规模打砸抢活动。在这场骚乱中，４０多辆小车被砸毁，１５０多名武警战士、公安干警和机关工作人员被打伤。
