When the student unrest began, as a graduate of Peking University, I was deeply moved by the patriotic fervor displayed by my fellow alumni during their marches. Later, when I saw the immense damage the unrest had caused our country, I felt deeply pained. This prompted me to reflect calmly on the student unrest. Here, I would like to express some thoughts on the term "patriotic students."

Since the unrest began, the term "patriotic students" has frequently appeared in newspapers, radio broadcasts, and television. This concept, during the unrest, generally referred to students who went on strike, took to the streets, held banners and shouted slogans, sat in protest, and went on hunger strikes.

Are all the actions of these students patriotic? No. The Constitution of our country and various laws, regulations, and rules are all designed to safeguard the fundamental interests of the state, maintain social stability, and ensure the well-being of the people. They represent the dignity of the state. Actions that disregard our socialist legal system cannot be considered patriotic. For example, forming illegal organizations, engaging in illegal marches, violating traffic regulations, and obstructing traffic cannot be considered patriotic actions. As for disrupting major state affairs, storming state institutions, and turning the symbol of our nation, Tiananmen Square, which is the aspiration of all Chinese people, into a mess, not only does this have nothing to do with patriotism, but it can be said to have damaged the national image.

Are all students who participated in these activities patriotic? It cannot be denied that the vast majority of students were filled with patriotic enthusiasm. At the same time, it should be noted that the broad masses of citizens, including a large number of students, who did not agree with or participate in these activities, also have deep patriotic feelings, and perhaps even more rational and lofty patriotic sentiments. As for the leaders of the illegal organization "Beijing Autonomous Federation of Students," they maliciously attacked the leadership of the Party, attacked the socialist system, stirred up trouble everywhere, and hoped that the country would fall into chaos. They even defamed and opposed the pillar of the Republic, the People's Liberation Army, attempting to overthrow the government of our country and seek rewards from foreign masters. This can only be described as treacherous behavior. We know that the student marchers shouted slogans such as "Support the Communist Party," "Eliminate Corruption," and "Patriotism is not a Crime." However, these slogans were carefully planned and uniformly printed by the leaders of the "Beijing Autonomous Federation of Students." These slogans were not made with sincere intentions but were merely a cover to deceive the broad masses of students and citizens. The slogan shouted most frequently and loudly was "Patriotism is not a Crime." This banner once became a protective umbrella and shield for a small number of people to commit crimes. Those who stubbornly held fast to the bourgeois liberalization stance, as well as hooligans and social dregs, all once gathered under this banner.

Therefore, I suggest that we stop using the term "patriotic students" indiscriminately. Please consider this.

### 对“爱国学生”提法的一点见解

　　对“爱国学生”提法的一点见解
    学潮刚开始的时候，作为一名北京大学毕业生，我曾为校友们游行中表现的爱国热情所感动。后来看到动乱给我们国家造成那样巨大的损失，我又感到十分痛心。这促使我冷静地反思这次学潮。这里我要说的是对“爱国学生”这个提法的一点见解。
    学潮以来“爱国学生”的字眼经常见诸报端、广播、电视。这个概念在动乱中泛指那些罢课上街闹学潮，举旗游行呼口号，静坐请愿搞绝食的学生。
    是这些学生的所有行为都是爱国的吗？不是。我国的宪法和各项法律法令法规都是为了维护国家的根本利益、保持社会稳定和保证人民安居乐业制定的，代表着国家的尊严。无视我国社会主义法制的行为，至少不能算是爱国吧。像成立非法组织，搞非法游行和违反交通法规、阻塞交通等这类行为，决不能算是爱国行为。至于干扰重大国事活动，冲击国家机关，把祖国的象征、全国人民向往的天安门广场搞得乌七八糟，非但与爱国沾不上边，说损害国家形象总不为过吧。
    是所有参加这类活动的学生都爱国吗？不可否认，绝大多数学生是满怀爱国热情的。同时也应看到，不赞同、不参加这类活动的广大公民，包括广大学生也是有满腔爱国热情的，甚至有着更理智、更崇高的爱国热情。至于大学生中的非法组织“高自联”里的头头，他们恶毒攻击党的领导，攻击社会主义制度，四处煽风点火，惟恐国家不乱，甚至诋毁和反对共和国的坚强柱石人民解放军，妄图颠覆我国政府，到外国主子那里邀功请赏，恐怕只能算是卖国的行径了。我们知道大学生的游行队伍中是喊过“拥护共产党”、“清除腐败”、“爱国无罪”等口号，但这些口号都是“高自联”的头目精心策划，统一印发的。制定这些口号，并非出以真心，不过是这些头头掩人耳目，欺世盗名，蒙骗广大学生和市民的幌子。这些口号中喊得最多的，喊得震天价响的，莫过于“爱国”了。“爱国无罪”的旗帜一度成了极少数人违法犯罪的保护伞和护身符，那些顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场的人、地痞流氓和社会渣滓都曾麇集在这面大旗之下。
    因此，我建议不要再滥用“爱国学生”这种提法，请予考虑。
