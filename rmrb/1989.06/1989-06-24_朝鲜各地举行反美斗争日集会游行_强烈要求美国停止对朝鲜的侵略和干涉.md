People's Daily, Pyongyang, June 24th - Over the past few days, various regions in North Korea have held rallies and parades to mark "June 25th Anti-American Struggle Day."

On June 24th, 180,000 people from various sectors in Pyongyang, Hamhung, Wonsan, and Kaesong held mass rallies and demonstrations. They strongly demanded that the United States stop its aggression and interference in North Korea, halt its efforts to create "two Koreas," and crush the new war provocations by the United States and the South Korean authorities. They also expressed their determination to achieve the independent and peaceful reunification of Korea as soon as possible.

The crowds at the rallies vehemently denounced the United States for launching an invasion of Korea 39 years ago, turning the country into a wasteland. They unanimously demanded that the United States stop interfering in North Korea's internal affairs and withdraw all its troops and weapons of mass destruction from South Korea.

The day before, several thousand people from the General Federation of Trade Unions of Korea, the Democratic Front for the Reunification of Korea, and central and local party and government agencies held a protest rally and demonstration in Sinchon County.

The participants unanimously pointed out that since the U.S. imperialists extended their aggressive tentacles to Korea, they have not only grossly violated Korea's sovereignty and independence and plundered Korea's wealth, but also turned Korea's land into a sea of fire.

The participants emphasized that after suffering defeat in the Korean War, the United States has not learned its lesson. For 36 years since the armistice, it has remained in South Korea and continued to engage in new war provocations, bringing immense misfortune and disaster to the South Korean people.

　　朝鲜各地举行反美斗争日集会游行    
    强烈要求美国停止对朝鲜的侵略和干涉
    本报平壤６月２４日电  记者徐宝康报道：连日来，朝鲜各地纷纷就“６·２５反美斗争日”举行集会和游行。
    ２４日，平壤市，咸兴市，元山市，开城市１８万各界群众举行群众集会和示威游行，强烈要求美国停止对朝鲜的侵略和干涉，停止制造“两个朝鲜”，并决心粉碎美国和南朝鲜当局的新战争挑衅，早日实现朝鲜的自主和平统一。
    各地群众在集会上纷纷声讨美国在３９年前发动侵朝战争，把朝鲜变成一片废墟的罪行，一致要求美国停止干涉朝鲜内政、从南朝鲜撤走一切军队和杀人武器。
    在此前一天，朝鲜职业总同盟、朝鲜统一民主主义战线等群众团体以及中央和地方党政机关数千人也在信川郡举行声讨大会和示威游行。
    与会者一致指出，自美帝国主义把侵略的魔爪伸向朝鲜以来，不仅粗暴侵犯了朝鲜的主权和独立，掠夺了朝鲜的财富，而且还把朝鲜的国土变成了一片火海。
    与会者强调说，美国在朝鲜战争战败以后，仍不接受教训，停战３６年来至今仍赖在南朝鲜，并不断进行新的战争挑衅活动，给南朝鲜人民带来了巨大的不幸和灾难。
