Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 29th.

The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Li Jinhua, said at a press conference held today that the Chinese government and people believe that Hong Kong can continue to maintain stability and prosperity.

A reporter asked, "Recent events in mainland China have led to an increase in Hong Kong residents seeking to emigrate. What measures will China take to remedy this?"

The spokesperson said, "As an international, modern city, the flow of people in Hong Kong is a normal phenomenon. In recent years, there has been an increase in the outflow of people and funds from Hong Kong, and the reasons are multifaceted."

She said, "To maintain the stability and prosperity of Hong Kong and to boost the confidence of Hong Kong people, Chinese leaders have already stated that China will continue to cooperate with Britain, strictly adhere to the Sino-British Joint Declaration, and implement a series of policies regarding Hong Kong through the drafting of the Basic Law."

She also said, "The policy of reform, opening up, and construction in mainland China will not change."
