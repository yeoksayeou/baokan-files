Comrades, you have worked hard! (Applause)

First of all, I express my profound sorrow for the brave soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the public security officers who sacrificed their lives in this struggle! I extend my warm regards to the thousands of soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the public security officers who were injured in this struggle! I extend my warm greetings to all the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the public security officers who participated in this struggle!

I propose that we all stand up and observe a moment of silence for the fallen comrades! (Standing in silence)

Taking this opportunity, I would like to say a few words.

This turmoil was bound to happen. It was determined by the international climate and China's own climate, and it was inevitable, not subject to human will, only a matter of time and scale. And now that it has happened, it is advantageous for us. The most advantageous thing is that we have a large number of old comrades who are still alive. They have experienced many storms and understand the pros and cons of things. They support taking decisive action against the riot. Although some comrades may not understand this for the time being, they will eventually understand and support the Central Committee's decision.

The April 26 editorial in the People's Daily defined the nature of the problem as turmoil. The words "turmoil" are apt. Some people opposed these two words and wanted to change them. Practice has proven that this judgment is accurate. Later, as the situation developed into a counter-revolutionary riot, it was also inevitable. We have a group of old comrades who are still alive, including the military, and a group of cadres who participated in the revolution at various times. Therefore, the situation is relatively easy to handle now. The main difficulty in handling this incident is that we have never encountered such a situation before. A small group of bad elements mixed in with so many students and onlookers, making it difficult to distinguish the lines at first, making it difficult for us to take necessary actions. If we did not have so many old comrades in our party supporting us, we would not even be able to determine the nature of the incident. Some comrades do not understand the nature of the problem and think that this is simply a matter of dealing with the masses. In fact, the other side is not just a group of people who do not distinguish right from wrong, but also a group of rebels and a large number of social dregs. They want to overthrow our country, overthrow our party, which is the essence of the problem. Not understanding this fundamental issue is not understanding the nature of the problem. I believe that through serious work, we can gain the support of the vast majority of party comrades for the definition and handling of the incident.

Once the incident broke out, it became clear. Their main slogans were two: one was to overthrow the Communist Party, and the other was to overthrow the socialist system. Their goal was to establish a completely Westernized bourgeois republic. The people demand anti-corruption, and we certainly accept that. Those with ulterior motives who put forward the so-called anti-corruption slogan, we should also accept it as a good word. Of course, this slogan is only an accompaniment to their core, which is to overthrow the Communist Party and the socialist system.

In this suppression of the riot, so many of our comrades were injured and even sacrificed their lives, and weapons were also seized. Why? It is also because good and bad people were mixed together, making it difficult for us to take decisive measures. Handling this matter is a very severe political test for our military. Practice has proven that our People's Liberation Army has passed the test. If we had used tanks to crush the riot, it would have caused confusion about right and wrong throughout the country. Therefore, I want to thank the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army for their attitude towards the riot. Although the losses are heartbreaking, they can win the hearts of the people and change the views of those who are unclear about right and wrong. Let everyone see who the People's Liberation Army is, whether they have bloodily suppressed Tiananmen, and who is shedding blood. Once this issue is clear, we will take the initiative. Although many comrades have sacrificed their lives, which is very heartbreaking, an objective analysis of the process of the incident will make people have to admit that the People's Liberation Army is the people's army. This will also help the people understand the methods we have taken in this struggle. In the future, when the People's Liberation Army encounters problems and takes measures, it will be able to obtain the support of the people. Here, I would like to add that in the future, we must not let people seize our weapons again. In short, this is a test, and the test is passed. Although there are not many old comrades in the military, the soldiers are mostly young people in their late teens and early twenties, but they are still true people's army. In the face of danger to life, they did not forget the people, did not forget the party's teachings, did not forget national interests, and faced death without hesitation. They are worthy of their title. When I say the test is passed, I mean the nature of the army is qualified. This army still has the tradition of the old Red Army. This time, it is a true political test and a test of life and death, which is not easy! This shows that the people's army is truly the iron wall of the party and the state. This shows that no matter how great our losses are, no matter how much we are renewed, our army will forever be an army under the leadership of the party, forever the defender of the state, forever the defender of socialism, forever the defender of the people's interests, and the most beloved people! At the same time, we must never forget how cruel our enemies are. We should not have even one percent of forgiveness for them.

This incident is worth our reflection and makes us calmly consider the past and the future. Perhaps this bad thing will make our reform and opening up steps more stable, better, and even faster. It will make us correct our mistakes faster and better promote our strengths. Today, I cannot elaborate on this, but only propose a topic.

The first question is: Is the line, principles, and policies formulated by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, including our development strategy of the "three-step" plan, correct? Has the correctness of the line, principles, and policies we formulated been called into question because of this turmoil? Is our goal a "leftist" goal? Should we continue to use it as our future goal? These major issues must be answered clearly and affirmatively. We have already completed the first goal of doubling our output; the second goal of doubling our output is planned to be completed in twelve years; and in the next fifty years, we aim to reach the level of a moderately developed country, with a growth rate of around 2.3 percent. This is our strategic goal. I think we have not made a "leftist" judgment, nor have we set an overly urgent goal. Therefore, the answer to the first question should be that the strategic goals we have formulated are at least not a failure. In sixty-one years, a country with a population of 1.5 billion people reaching the level of a moderately developed country is a great achievement. Achieving such a goal should be possible. We cannot say that our strategic goals are wrong just because this incident has occurred.

The second question is: Is the "one center, two basic points" summarized by the Thirteenth Party Congress correct? Are the two basic points, namely the Four Cardinal Principles and reform and opening up, wrong? I have been thinking about this question recently. We have not made a mistake. The Four Cardinal Principles themselves are not wrong. If there is a mistake, it is that we have not consistently adhered to the Four Cardinal Principles, not treated them as a fundamental ideology to educate the people, students, all cadres, and Communist Party members. The nature of this incident is the opposition between bourgeois liberalization and the Four Cardinal Principles. The Four Cardinal Principles, ideological and political work, opposition to bourgeois liberalization, and opposition to spiritual pollution, we have not been consistent in our actions, and we have even spoken very little about them. It is not that the Four Cardinal Principles are wrong, but that we have not been consistent in adhering to them, and our ideological and political work is too poor. In my New Year's speech at the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference in 1980, I mentioned the "four guarantees," one of which is the "spirit of hard work and self-reliance." Hard work is our tradition. The education of hard work and simplicity must be grasped in the future, for sixty to seventy years. The more our country develops, the more we must grasp hard work and self-reliance. Promoting the spirit of hard work and self-reliance will also help to overcome corruption. Since the founding of the country, we have always been talking about hard work and self-reliance. Later, when life was a bit better, we advocated high consumption, and thus various wasteful phenomena spread. Coupled with weak ideological and political work and an imperfect legal system, various illegal and disorderly acts and corruption emerged. I told foreigners that the biggest mistake in the past ten years was education, and here I mainly refer to ideological and political education, not just for schools and young students, but for the education of the people in general. Regarding hard work and self-reliance, regarding what kind of country China is and what kind of country it will become, there has been very little education, which is a big mistake on our part.

Has the basic point of reform and opening up been wrong? No, it has not. Without reform and opening up, how could we have today? In the past ten years, the people's living standards have improved significantly, and we should say that we have made a leap forward, although problems such as inflation have emerged. But the achievements of ten years of reform and opening up should be fully recognized. Of course, reform and opening up will inevitably bring in many bad influences from the West, and we have never underestimated this. In the early 1980s, when we established economic special zones, I discussed with comrades from Guangdong that we should do two things: one is to grasp reform and opening up, and the other is to severely crack down on economic crimes, including ideological and political work. This is the two-point theory. But looking back today, there are obvious shortcomings. One hand is relatively firm, and the other hand is relatively weak. The combination is not good. This point may be helpful for us to formulate policies in the future. Also, we must continue to adhere to the combination of planned economy and market regulation, and this cannot be changed. In actual work, during the adjustment period, we can strengthen or increase the planned aspect, and in another period, increase the market regulation aspect, making it more flexible. In the future, it will still be the combination of planned economy and market regulation. The important thing is not to turn China into a closed country. Implementing a closed policy is extremely unfavorable to us, even information is not smooth. Now, isn't information important? Indeed, it is very important. People who do management work without information are like having a blocked nose and deaf ears. Also, we must never repeat the past and make the economy rigid. I propose this suggestion for the Standing Committee to study. This is also a relatively urgent problem that we will inevitably encounter.

This is a summary of our past ten years. Our basic propositions, from the development strategy to the policies, including reform and opening up, are all correct. If there is any lack, it is that reform and opening up are not enough. We have encountered more difficulties in reform than in opening up. In terms of political system reform, there is one thing that can be affirmed: we must adhere to the system of the People's Congress, not the American-style three-branch system. In fact, Western countries do not all implement the three-branch system. The United States criticizes us for suppressing students, but when they deal with domestic student unrest and riots, don't they also send in police and the military, and don't they also arrest people and shed blood? They suppress students and the people, while we suppress counter-revolutionary riots. They have no right to criticize us! In the future, when dealing with such issues, we should pay attention to not letting a dynamic situation spread.

How will we proceed in the future? I say that we will continue to implement the basic line, principles, and policies formulated since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and we will do so firmly and unshakably. Except for some language that may need to be adjusted, the basic line and basic principles and policies will not change. This issue has been raised, and I ask everyone to consider it seriously. As for some measures, such as the direction of investment and the use of funds, I support strengthening basic industries and agriculture. Basic industries, such as raw material industries, transportation, and energy, should strengthen investment in these areas and adhere to this for ten to twenty years, even if it means borrowing money. This is also opening up, and we should be bolder in this regard and will not make big mistakes. More electricity, more railways, highways, and shipping can do many things. Steel, foreigners judge that we will need 120 million tons in the future, and now we are close to 60 million tons, still half. If we add 20 million tons on the basis of the existing enterprises, we can reduce the import of steel materials. Borrowing some foreign debt for these purposes is also called reform and opening up. The current problem is not whether the reform and opening up policy is correct, whether to do it or not, but how to do it, which aspect to open and which aspect to close.

We must firmly and unshakably implement the series of line, principles, and policies formulated since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee. We must seriously summarize our experience, continue what is correct, correct our mistakes, and add more effort to what is lacking. In short, we must summarize the present and look to the future.

Taking this opportunity, I will say this much.

　　在接见首都戒严部队军以上干部时的讲话    
    （１９８９年６月９日，根据记录整理）
    邓小平
    同志们辛苦了！（热烈鼓掌）
    首先，我对在这场斗争中英勇牺牲的解放军指战员、武警指战员和公安干警的同志们表示沉痛的哀悼！对在这场斗争中负伤的几千名解放军指战员、武警指战员和公安干警的同志们表示亲切的慰问！对所有参加这场斗争的解放军指战员、武警指战员和公安干警的同志们致以亲切的问候！
    我提议，大家起立，为死难的烈士们默哀！（肃立默哀）
    利用这个机会，我讲几句话。
    这场风波迟早要来。这是国际的大气候和中国自己的小气候所决定了的，是一定要来的，是不以人们的意志为转移的，只不过是迟早的问题，大小的问题。而现在来，对我们比较有利。最有利的是，我们有一大批老同志健在，他们经历的风波多，懂得事情的利害关系，他们是支持对暴乱采取坚决行动的。虽然有一些同志一时还不理解，但最终是会理解的，会支持中央这个决定的。
    《人民日报》四月二十六日社论，把问题的性质定为动乱。“动乱”这两个字恰如其分，一些人反对的就是这两个字，要修改的也是这两个字。实践证明，这个判断是准确的。后来事态进一步发展到反革命暴乱，也是必然的。我们有一批老同志健在，包括军队，也有一批各个时期参加革命的骨干还在，因此，事情现在爆发，处理起来比较容易。处理这一事件的主要难点在于，我们从来没有遇到过这种情况，一小撮坏人混杂在那么多青年学生和围观的群众中间，阵线一时分不清楚，使我们许多应该采取的行动难以出手。如果没有我们党这么多老同志支持，甚至连事件的性质都难以确定。一些同志不了解问题的性质，认为这只是单纯的对待群众的问题，实际上，对方不只是一些是非不分的群众，还有一批造反派和大量的社会渣滓。他们是要颠覆我们的国家，颠覆我们的党，这是问题的实质。不懂得这个根本问题，就是性质不清楚。我相信，经过认真做工作，能取得党内绝大多数同志对定性和处理的拥护。
    事情一爆发出来，就很明确。他们的根本口号主要是两个，一是要打倒共产党，一是要推翻社会主义制度。他们的目的是要建立一个完全西方附庸化的资产阶级共和国。人民要求反腐败，我们当然接受。那些别有用心的人提出的所谓反腐败的口号，我们也要当好话来接受。当然，这个口号仅仅是他们的一个陪衬，而其核心是打倒共产党，推翻社会主义制度。
    这次平息暴乱中，我们那么多同志负了伤，甚至牺牲了，武器也被抢去了，这是为什么？也是因为好人坏人混杂在一起，使我们有些应该采取的断然措施难于出手。处理这件事对我们军队是一次很严峻的政治考验，实践证明，我们的解放军考试合格。如果用坦克压过去，就会在全国造成是非不清。所以，我要感谢解放军指战员用这种态度来对待暴乱事件。尽管损失是令人痛心的，但可以赢得人民，使是非不明的人改变观点。让大家看看，解放军究竟是什么人，有没有血洗天安门，流血的到底是谁。这个问题清楚了，就使我们取得了主动。虽然牺牲了许多同志非常令人痛心，但客观地分析事件的过程，人们就不得不承认，解放军是人民的子弟兵。这也有助于人民理解在这场斗争中我们所采取的方法，今后解放军遇到问题，采取措施，就都可以得到人民的支持了。这里顺便说一下，以后再不能让人把武器夺去了。总之，这是一个考验，考试是合格的。虽然军队里老同志不是很多了，战士们大都是十八、九岁，二十岁出头的娃娃，但他们仍然是真正的人民子弟兵。在生命危险面前，他们没有忘记人民，没有忘记党的教导，没有忘记国家利益，面对死亡毫不含糊。慷慨赴死，从容就义，他们当之无愧。我讲考试合格，就是指军队仍然是人民子弟兵，这个性质合格。这个军队还是我们的老红军的传统。这次过的是真正的政治关、生死关，不容易呀！这表明，人民子弟兵真正是党和国家的钢铁长城。这表明，不管我们受到多么大的损失，不管如何更新换代，我们这个军队永远是党领导下的军队，永远是国家的捍卫者，永远是社会主义的捍卫者，永远是人民利益的捍卫者，是最可爱的人！同时，我们永远也不要忘记，我们的敌人是多么凶残，对他们，连百分之一的原谅都不应有。
    这次事件爆发出来，很值得我们思索，促使我们很冷静地考虑一下过去，也考虑一下未来。也许这件坏事会使我们改革开放的步子迈得更稳、更好，甚至于更快。使我们的失误纠正得更快，使我们的长处发扬得更好。今天我不可能展开来讲，只是提出一个课题。
    第一个问题，党的十一届三中全会制定的路线方针政策，包括我们发展战略的“三步曲”，正确不正确？是不是因为发生了这次动乱，我们制定的路线方针政策的正确性就发生了问题？我们的目标是不是一个“左”的目标？是否还要继续用它作为我们今后奋斗的目标？这些大的问题，必须作出明确、肯定的回答。我们第一个翻一番的目标已经完成了；第二个翻一番的目标计划用十二年完成；再往后五十年，要达到一个中等发达国家的水平，增长速度为百分之二点几就够了。这就是我们的战略目标。对此，我想我们做出的不是一个“左”的判断，制定的也不是一个过急的目标。因此，对第一个问题的回答，应当说，我们所制定的战略目标，现在至少不能说是失败的。在六十一年后，一个十五亿人口的国家，达到中等发达国家的水平，是了不起的事情。实现这样一个目标，应该是能够做到的。不能因为这次事件的发生，就说我们的战略目标错了。
    第二个问题，党的十三大概括的“一个中心、两个基本点”对不对？两个基本点，即四个坚持和改革开放，是不是错了？我最近总在想这个问题。我们没有错。四个坚持本身没有错，如果说有错误的话，就是坚持四项基本原则还不够一贯，没有把它作为基本思想来教育人民，教育学生，教育全体干部和共产党员。这次事件的性质，就是资产阶级自由化和四个坚持的对立。四个坚持、思想政治工作、反对资产阶级自由化、反对精神污染，我们不是没有讲，而是缺乏一贯性，没有行动，甚至讲得都很少。不是错在四个坚持本身，而是错在坚持得不够一贯，教育和思想政治工作太差。１９８０年元旦，我在政协讲话，讲了“四个保证”，其中有一条叫“艰苦奋斗的创业精神”。艰苦奋斗是我们的传统，艰苦朴素的教育今后要抓紧，一直要抓六十至七十年。我们的国家越发展，越要抓艰苦创业。提倡艰苦创业精神，也有助于克服腐败现象。建国以来我们一直在讲艰苦创业，后来日子稍微好一点，就提倡高消费，于是，各方面的浪费现象蔓延，加上思想政治工作薄弱、法制不健全，什么违法乱纪和腐败现象等等，都出来了。我对外国人讲，十年最大的失误是教育，这里我主要是讲思想政治教育，不单纯是对学校、青年学生，是泛指对人民的教育。对于艰苦创业，对于中国是个什么样的国家，将要变成一个什么样的国家，这种教育都很少，这是我们很大的失误。
    改革开放这个基本点错了没有？没有错。没有改革开放，怎么会有今天？这十年人民生活水平有较大提高，应该说我们上了一个台阶，尽管出现了通货膨胀等问题，但十年改革开放的成绩要充分估计够。当然，改革开放必然会有西方的许多坏的影响进来，对此，我们从来没有估计不足。八十年代初建立经济特区时，我与广东同志谈，要两手抓，一手要抓改革开放，一手要抓严厉打击经济犯罪，包括抓思想政治工作。就是两点论。但今天回头来看，出现了明显的不足，一手比较硬，一手比较软。一硬一软不相称，配合得不好。讲这点，可能对我们以后制定方针政策有好处。还有，我们要继续坚持计划经济与市场调节相结合，这个不能改。实际工作中，在调整时期，我们可以加强或者多一点计划性，而在另一个时候多一点市场调节，搞得更灵活一些。以后还是计划经济与市场调节相结合。重要的是，切不要把中国搞成一个关闭性的国家。实行关闭政策的做法对我们极为不利，连信息都不灵通。现在不是讲信息重要嘛，确实很重要。做管理工作的人没有信息，就是鼻子不通，耳目不灵。再是绝不能重复回到过去那样，把经济搞得死死的。我提出的这个建议，请常委研究。这也是个比较急迫的问题，总要接触的问题。
    这是总结我们过去十年。我们的一些基本提法，从发展战略到方针政策，包括改革开放，都是对的。要说不够，就是改革开放得还不够。我们在改革中遇到的难题比在开放中遇到的难题要多。在政治体制改革方面，有一点可以肯定，就是我们要坚持实行人民代表大会的制度，而不是美国式的三权鼎立制度。实际上，西方国家也并不都是实行三权鼎立式的制度。美国骂我们镇压学生，他们处理国内学潮和骚乱，还不是出动了警察和军队，还不是抓人、流血？他们是镇压学生和人民，而我们则是平息反革命暴乱。他们有什么资格批评我们！今后，在处理这类问题的时候，倒是要注意，一个动态出现，不要使它蔓延。
    以后我们怎么办？我说，我们原来制定的基本路线、方针、政策，照样干下去，坚定不移地干下去。除了个别语言有的需要变动一下，基本路线和基本方针、政策都不变。这个问题已经提出来了，请大家认真考虑一下。至于一些做法，如投资方向、资金使用方向等，我赞成加强基础工业和农业。基础工业，无非是原材料工业、交通、能源等，要加强这方面的投资，要坚持十到二十年，宁肯欠债，也要加强。这也是开放，在这方面，胆子要大一些，不会有大的失误。多搞一点电，多搞一点铁路、公路、航运，能办很多事情。钢，外国人判断我们将来需要一亿二千万吨，现在我们接近六千万吨，还差一半。如果在现有企业的基础上加以改造，增加两千万吨，就可少进口钢材。借点外债用在这些方面，也叫改革开放。现在的问题不是改革开放政策对不对，搞不搞，而是如何搞，开哪方面，关哪方面。
    要坚定不移地执行党的十一届三中全会以来制定的一系列路线方针政策，要认真总结经验，对的要继续坚持，失误的要纠正，不足的要加点劲。总之，要总结现在，看到未来。
    利用这个机会，我就讲这一点。
