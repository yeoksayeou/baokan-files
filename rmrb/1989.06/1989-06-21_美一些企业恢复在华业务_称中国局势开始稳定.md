Some U.S. companies are gradually resuming their operations in China, according to a report by the Associated Press from New York. Some American companies have said that there are increasing signs that the situation in China is stabilizing. Most of their employees have returned to work in China, and many of their business operations have resumed.

An official from Occidental Petroleum, headquartered in Los Angeles, said the company has informed its employees in Beijing that they can return to China.

Robinson, the vice chairman of Portman Overseas Investments in Atlanta, said that the company's project to build the tallest building in Shanghai—a commercial complex with a total investment of $175 million—is nearing completion. Most experts have already returned to Shanghai.
