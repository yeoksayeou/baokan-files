The Shengli Oilfield produces over 30 million tons of crude oil annually, accounting for approximately one-quarter of the nation's total crude oil production. In recent times, lawless elements from nearby rural areas have been brazenly stealing oilfield resources, both openly and covertly. Last year, the oilfield uncovered 1,250 cases of theft involving oilfield resources and equipment, including 320 major cases. These thefts resulted in a loss of over 4.01 million yuan for the entire oilfield and caused hundreds of oil wells to cease production.

In the first two months of this year, the number of cases involving the theft and sabotage of oilfield equipment and the number of major cases increased by 50% and 32% respectively compared to the same period last year. Most alarming was the incident on the night of March 11, when criminals broke into the warehouse of the Drilling Supply Company and stole resources worth over $100,000, including 40 imported electric coils.

Although the oilfield has implemented emergency measures to strengthen investigation and prevention, it is still difficult to completely prevent such incidents. We appeal to local governments to cooperate with the oilfield in severely cracking down on criminal elements to ensure the completion of the state's crude oil production tasks.

　　胜利油田被盗严重
    胜利油田年产原油３０００多万吨，约占全国原油产量的１／４。近一个时期以来，附近农村的一些不法分子明抢暗偷油田物资，十分猖獗。去年，全油田就破获盗窃油田物资设备案１２５０起，其中重大案件３２０起。这些盗窃案使全油田损失４０１万多元，还造成数以百计的油井停产。
    今年一二月间，一些不法分子盗窃破坏油田设备的案件数和重大案件数分别比去年同期上升５０％和３２％。尤为严重的是３月１１日晚，犯罪分子破窗进入钻井供应公司的仓库，盗走价值１０多万美元的物资，其中有进口电动线圈４０个。
    我油田虽采取了应急措施，加强了查处和防范，但仍防不胜防。呼吁地方政府配合油田严厉打击犯罪分子，保证国家原油生产任务的完成。
