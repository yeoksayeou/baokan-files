With the public's vigilance against economic crimes, some criminals have adopted more covert and cunning methods to commit crimes in defiance of the law. This is a noteworthy social phenomenon.

From January to April this year, the Tianjin Procuratorate received an increasing number of public tips, leading to the investigation of 256 economic crime cases, a 56.1% increase compared to the same period last year. Among these, 70% were cases of crimes committed in defiance of the intensified crackdown on economic crimes over the past year. The notable characteristics of these crimes include:

1. Using deceptive names such as "consulting," "subsidy," "temporary borrowing," or having relatives act as intermediaries to conceal bribery.
2. Forming groups to commit crimes and protect each other. Often, uncovering one person leads to the discovery of two or three more. This phenomenon has caused outrage and apprehension among those who are aware of these crimes. While public reporting in Tianjin is very active, the proportion of anonymous reports is significant, accounting for about 60%, higher than the national average.

Recently, the Tianjin Procuratorate has successfully investigated two major economic crime cases, the largest in the city's history. The Tianjin branch of the China Machinery and Equipment Import and Export Corporation's Jin Wenjie and the Fangjiazhuang Credit Union's Yang Wenming were found to have embezzled over 30 million yuan. Out of the 66 cases filed in April, 16 were major or particularly serious cases, resulting in the arrest of 28 individuals. Concurrently, the procuratorial departments have ensured that every public tip is acknowledged, and rewards and protections are provided to the informants.

    天津踊跃举报经济犯罪
    本报天津６月２０日电  记者肖荻报道：天津检察院今年受理的群众举报显示：在老鼠过街人人喊打的势态下，一些经济犯罪分子往往采取更加隐蔽狡猾的手法顶风作案。这是值得注意的社会现象。
    今年１至４月，天津检察院受理群众举报仍呈上升趋势，巳立案查处２５６件经济犯罪案，比去年同期上升５６．１％。其中，在加紧打击经济犯罪活动的一年来顶风作案的占７０％。其特点是犯罪手法更加隐蔽。如：打着“聘任”、“咨询”、“补助”、“暂借”名义，或叫亲属出头变相受贿。二是成帮结伙，互相包庇。有的揪出一人追查出两三个。这一现象使知情者既愤恨不平又心存顾忌。天津群众举报十分踊跃，但匿名现象突出，约占６０％左右，高于全国平均数。
    最近天津市检察机关连续侦破两起该市建国以来最大的经济犯罪案件。中国机械设备进出口公司天津分公司金文珍、天津宝坻方家庄信用社杨文明等均侵吞公款３０多万元。在４月份立案的６６件中，重、特大案件占１６件，已依法逮捕２８人。与此同时，检察部门对群众举报做到件件有反馈，对举报者兑现奖励并严加保护。
