Blood Soaks a Generation of Naval Spirits

    Reports of the "3.14 Naval Battle" this year in the South China Sea tell of six Chinese naval soldiers standing in seawater up to their knees, guarding a newly emerged reef. According to international maritime law, the 200-kilometer sea area around the reef belongs to our country, and we will not allow any foreign country to occupy it. Whoever loses this small reef loses a 200-kilometer radius of national territory, and whoever does so is a criminal in history...

    I
    Is this also building a new Great Wall with flesh and blood? Six people stand in seawater up to their knees, defending a reef that has just emerged from the sea.

    The concrete foundation on the reef, with a red national flag fluttering in the wind, is the center that unites everything. Six people stand back to back, hand in hand, even transmitting body heat with a shared belief.

    This is a newborn baby, still bloody from the motherland. This is a territory soaked in seawater. This is a territory that requires blood and tears to nurture, a territory that requires sacrifices to create. Territory, it is a name that makes one intoxicated, a sacred name, a song that is always yearned for. Oh, this new territory.

    II
    In the bitter seawater, the reef that has just emerged needs warmth, tranquility, and heavy love. But if someone invades it, I will not tolerate it, I will not hesitate.

    The seawater dyed red by the morning light is a smile and a blessing. But the seawater dyed red by fresh blood? That is a warning, a duty, a mixture of love and hate, a monument soaked in it.

    III
    A reef is 200 nautical miles of territory. Do not despise the smallness of the reef. Once it becomes the border of the motherland, it becomes immensely great. Losing it is a sin, and being invaded and defiled is even more of a sin. A reef will forge the spirit of a generation of naval soldiers. A reef will also forge the dignity of a nation's independence, an unyielding and immortal image standing in the world.

    I guard the reef. The reef becomes me. The reef is in my heart's ocean. I am the tree on the reef, the flower on the reef.

    If one day I leave this world, please hang the equally sacred military medal given to me on a corner of another newly emerged reef. Yes, another new reef's corner.

　　血染一代海魂
    柯蓝
    报载南沙今年“３·１４海战”，中国海军战士六人，站立在海水中，护卫刚露出海面的礁盘。按国际海洋法，礁盘２００公里海面归祖国所有，决不容许外国侵占。谁丢失这小小礁盘，就丢失了周径２００公里的国土，谁就是历史的罪人……
    一
    这也是用血肉去建筑新的长城吗？六个人站在过膝的海水里，去维护一个露出海面的礁盘。
    礁盘上刚用水泥竖起的基石，上面插着一杆迎风的鲜红的国旗。这，就是凝聚一切的中心。六个人背靠背，手牵手，连体温也传递着一个信念。
    这是从祖国母体刚出生的带血的婴儿。这是泡浸在海水中的国土。这是要付出血泪去哺育、要付出代价去创造的国土。国土，就是一个令人心醉的、神圣的名字，一首永远令人向往的歌。呵，这新生的国土。
    二
    在海水苦涩中刚刚冒出的礁盘，它需要温暖，需要宁静和沉重的爱。但，一旦有人侵犯她，我决不容忍，决不犹豫。
    晨光染红的海水，那是微笑和祝福。而用鲜血染红的海水呢？那是一种警惕，一种职责，一种爱和恨交织的、融浸在一起的碑文。
    三
  　一个礁盘，就是２００海里的国土。请不要嫌弃礁盘的渺小。一旦它成为祖国的边线，它就高大无比。丢弃是罪恶，被侵犯、被玷污更是罪恶。一个礁盘将铸造一代海魂。一个礁盘也将铸造一个民族自主的尊严，一个不朽不屈的立足世界的形象。
    我卫护礁盘。礁盘化为我。礁盘自在我心中的海洋。我是礁盘上的树，礁盘上的花。
    如果有一天我离开了人间，请把给我的同样圣洁的军功章，挂在另一个新浮现的礁盘的一角。是的，另一个新的礁盘的一角。
