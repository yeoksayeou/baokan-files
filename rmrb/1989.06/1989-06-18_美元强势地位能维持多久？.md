A notable phenomenon in the Western foreign exchange market this year has been the rise in the dollar exchange rate amidst fluctuations, reversing the trend of weakness and decline seen in recent years. As of now, the dollar has appreciated by nearly 13% against 18 other Western currencies compared to the end of last year. Notably, it has appreciated by over 13% against the European Currency Unit and more than 13% against the West German Mark, breaking the two Mark barrier for the first time since December 1986. The dollar-to-yen exchange rate has also surpassed 142, the highest since October 27, 1987, with an appreciation of over 14%. The dollar has appreciated even more against the Swiss Franc and the British Pound, by over 17% and 15% respectively. Among the major Western currencies, only the Canadian dollar has maintained a stable exchange rate with the dollar, with an appreciation of just 0.5%.

The significant rise in the dollar's exchange rate against major Western currencies this year is indeed intriguing, especially considering that the U.S. currently faces severe "twin deficits" (trade and fiscal deficits), particularly its massive trade deficit, which would require a weaker dollar to gradually correct. However, several factors in the U.S. and global economic and political environments this year have supported the dollar's strength, driving its continuous rise.

Firstly, after several years of significant depreciation, the dollar's purchasing power parity indicates that it was already undervalued last year. Consequently, the competitiveness of U.S. goods has improved, with exports growing by 26.8% in 1988 and the trade deficit decreasing by 22%, a rare occurrence in the past decade. As people realize the dollar's undervaluation, the demand for dollars in the foreign exchange market naturally increases.

Secondly, U.S. inflation and price increases accelerated last year, leading to multiple interest rate hikes. This year, the price increase trend has been even more pronounced, and the financial community has long anticipated further interest rate hikes in the U.S. This has stimulated more demand for dollars, further driving up the dollar's value.

Thirdly, the Federal Reserve has repeatedly emphasized its anti-inflation policy, slightly tightening monetary and credit policies, which has also helped maintain the dollar's stable position. The rise in the dollar's exchange rate aligns with its anti-inflation policy, so the U.S. government has adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards it.

Fourthly, the rise in oil prices this year has increased the global demand for dollars, driving up the dollar's exchange rate.

Fifthly, the U.S. economic growth rate has slowed, which is seen as a sign of a healthy economy. Japan and West Germany, on the other hand, have experienced currency impacts due to domestic political factors. Thus, the dollar is considered a better currency for preservation or investment. West Germany's implementation of a withholding tax on interest this year has caused capital outflows, further weakening the Mark.

However, how long can the dollar maintain its current strong position? Given the complexity of the situation, domestic and international experts have varying views. Most believe that by the end of this year or sometime in the second half, the dollar will decline again. Looking at a longer timeframe, the dollar remains a weak currency. The primary reason is that the U.S.'s "twin deficits" are unlikely to see significant improvement in the future. The author believes that the dollar's appreciation trend will not last long. In the near term, there may be fluctuations or a stalemate, followed by a potential weakening. The main reason is that the U.S.'s high interest rates have severely impacted the housing construction industry and are affecting the automotive industry. Therefore, there is little room for further interest rate hikes, while Japan and others may raise their interest rates. Additionally, some temporary factors contributing to the dollar's strength may gradually change or disappear. Once this happens, the dollar's trend may weaken.

### 美元强势地位能维持多久？

　　美元强势地位能维持多久？
    蔡述理
    今年以来西方外汇市场上的一个突出现象，就是美元汇率在波动中上升，扭转了近几年来在波动中呈疲软下跌的状态。迄今，美元对西方其他１８种货币汇率加数平均比去年年底时已升值将近１３％，其中对欧洲货币单位升值１３％以上，对西德马克升值幅度也超过１３％，突破两马克，是１９８６年１２月以来的首次。美元对日元的比价也突破１４２，是１９８７年１０月２７日以来最高的，升值幅度超过１４％。美元对瑞士法郎和英镑升值幅度更大，分别超过１７％和１５％。西方主要货币中，只有加拿大元同美元汇率基本保持平稳，美元对其升值仅达０．５％。
    今年来美元对西方主要货币汇率回升幅度之大的确耐人寻味，因为美国目前的“双赤字”（即贸易赤字和财政赤字）仍较严重，尤其是其巨额的贸易赤字还须保持美元的弱势才能逐步纠正。但是，今年来在美国及世界经济、政治环境中，出现了一些支持美元强势的因素，促使美元步步攀升。
    首先，美元经过前几年的大幅度贬值之后，从货币购买力平价看，前一年美元就已出现被低估的趋势。因此，美国商品的竞争力提高，１９８８年出口增长２６．８％，贸易赤字减少２２％，成为近１０年来的罕见现象。人们觉察到美元被低估时，外汇市场中购入美元者必然增多。
    其次，美国去年通货膨胀和物价上涨加剧，利率几经调高，今年来物价涨势尤甚，西方金融界中，人们一直预期，美国利率必将再升无疑。这又刺激人们多购美元，从而导致美元进一步上升。
    第三，美国联邦储备局一再强调反通货膨胀的政策，银根与信贷略为收紧，这也有助于维持美元的坚稳地位。而美元汇率上升与其反通货膨胀政策吻合，因此美政府对此采取听其自然的态度。
    第四，今年来石油价格上涨，致使国际上对美元的需求增多，美元汇率上升。
    第五，美国经济增长速度已经放慢，人们认为这是美国经济健康的表现。日本和西德则由于国内的政治因素而对其货币产生了冲击。于是，美元则被认为是一种较好的保值或投资货币。西德今年施行征收利息预扣税，造成资本外流，也使马克疲软。
    但是，美元当前的强硬地位能维持多久呢？由于情况复杂，国内外行家对此看法纷纭，多数人认为到今年下半年某时或年底以前，美元将再度转跌，从更长时间看，美元还是一种疲软的货币。主要原因是美国的“双赤字”今后尚难有大的缓解。笔者认为，美元汇率挺升的局面不会维持太久，近期内可能出现升跌互见，或僵持的局面，以后可能开始转疲。重要原因是美国的高利率已使住宅建筑业受到严重打击，并波及汽车工业，因此利率再度调高的余地很小，而日本等的利率则有可能调高。此外，导致美元强势地位的某些临时因素，有的可能逐渐发生转化或消失。一旦出现这种情况，美元走势便可能转弱。
