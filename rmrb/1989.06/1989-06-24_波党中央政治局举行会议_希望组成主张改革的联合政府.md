The Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee Politburo Holds a Meeting
	Hopes to Form a Reform-Minded Coalition Government

	Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, June 22 (Reporter Tang Deqiao) Local newspapers today published a communiqué from the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee Politburo meeting, stating that the Polish United Workers' Party hopes to form a broadly representative, reform-minded "coalition government."

	The Politburo held a full meeting on the 20th, analyzing the results of the recent parliamentary elections and the domestic situation after the elections.

	The communiqué pointed out that the Constructive Opposition, which holds 35% of the seats in the parliament and an overwhelming majority in the Senate, should not only participate in governance but also take responsibility for the fate of the Polish state and major domestic developments.

	The communiqué believes that the proposal made earlier by the First Secretary of the Polish United Workers' Party Central Committee, Jaruzelski, to establish a broadly representative coalition government is "supported by other ruling parties and organizations" and is "timely." The communiqué hopes that this proposal will receive an active response from the Constructive Opposition, which is centered around Solidarity.

	Leaders and some advisors of Solidarity had previously stated that they "will only participate in the parliament, but not in the government." However, their stance has changed somewhat recently. Wałęsa said at a press conference that, as a whole, "Solidarity will not participate in the government," but since Solidarity is not a political party and is not bound by party discipline, "it does not rule out the possibility of individual members participating in the government."

　　波党中央政治局举行会议    
    希望组成主张改革的联合政府
    新华社华沙６月２２日电（记者汤德乔）此间报纸今天发表的波兰统一工人党中央政治局会议公报说，波兰统一工人党希望组成一个有广泛代表性的主张改革的“联合政府”。
    波党中央政治局２０日举行了全体会议，分析不久前举行的议会选举结果和大选后的国内形势。
    会议公报指出，在议会中占３５％席位并在参议院中占绝大多数席位的建设性反对派不仅应当参加执政，而且应对波兰国家的命运和国内的重大事态发展“承担责任”。
    公报认为，波兰统一工人党中央第一书记雅鲁泽尔斯基先前提出的关于成立有广泛代表性的联合政府的建议是“得到执政的其他党派和团体支持的”，是“适合时宜的”。公报希望这建议得到以团结工会为核心的建设性反对派积极响应。
    团结工会领导人和一些顾问早些时候曾表示，他们“只参加议会，但不参加政府”。不过，最近他们的说法有些变化。瓦文萨在一次记者招待会上说，就团结工会整体来说，“将不参加政府”，但是由于团结工会不是政党，没有党纪约束，“不排除个别成员参加政府的可能性”。
