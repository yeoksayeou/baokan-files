The U.S. government proposed a new plan to control air pollution on June 12, requiring a reduction of industrial emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen dioxide by 1,000 million tons and 200 million tons respectively each year, and a 3% reduction in exhaust emissions from urban vehicles. This was announced by President Bush in a speech today. However, this plan will significantly increase industrial investment, particularly in the power, automotive, and petroleum industries. According to the estimate by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Director Reilly, implementing this new plan will require the industrial sector to spend between $14 billion and $18 billion annually.

　　美提出治理空气新计划
    本报华盛顿电  美国政府６月１２日提出治理空气污染新计划，要求每年把工业排泄的二氧化硫和二氧化氮分别减少１０００万吨和２００万吨，并把城市车辆等排泄的废气减少３％。这是布什总统在今天发表的演说中提出的。但这一计划将大大增加工业投资，特别是发电、汽车和石油工业的投资。据美国环保局局长雷利估计，实施这一新计划，工业部门每年需耗资１４０亿至１８０亿美元。
