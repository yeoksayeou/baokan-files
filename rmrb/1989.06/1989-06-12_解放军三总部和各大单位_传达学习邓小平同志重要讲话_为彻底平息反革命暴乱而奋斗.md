The PLA General Departments and various major units have been studying and disseminating the important speech given by Deng Xiaoping, Chairman of the Central Military Commission, during his meeting with martial law troops at the corps level and above. They have expressed their determination to resolutely follow the Party's leadership, remain loyal to the people, and strive for a complete victory in stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion to stabilize the situation.

In recent days, the General Staff Department, General Political Department, General Logistics Department, Beijing Military Region, Shenyang Military Region, Jinan Military Region, Nanjing Military Region, Guangzhou Military Region, Chengdu Military Region, Lanzhou Military Region, Air Force, Navy, Second Artillery Corps, Commission of Science, Technology and Industry for National Defense, National Defense University, and the Academy of Military Sciences have all held meetings of their party committees and staff meetings to study and disseminate Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech. Through study and discussion, everyone has gained a deep understanding of the nature and roots of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital, the decisive role played by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries at the critical moment of the Party and the state's life and death, and the important role of our army in defending the motherland and consolidating the people's democratic dictatorship.

Many comrades said that at a time when the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion has achieved initial success, Chairman Deng's warm reception of the leaders of the martial law troops and his important speech will have an immeasurable impact on unifying the thoughts of the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country, smashing the counter-revolutionary rumors spread by a few conspirators, and fundamentally stabilizing the current situation. Some old comrades said that Chairman Deng is the true helmsman of our Party and state. Especially since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, he has pointed the way for us at every critical moment. At this crucial juncture when the Party and the state are in danger, it is he who has stepped forward with the great courage and daring of a proletarian revolutionary, leading the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country to smash this counter-revolutionary rebellion, save the socialist cause, and preserve the achievements of the past decade of reform.

Through study and discussion, everyone has further clarified the nature of this struggle. Many comrades said that Chairman Deng's explanation of the nature of this struggle is very clear. A few people's calls for democracy and anti-corruption are just a cover. The essence is to overthrow the Communist Party, negate the socialist system, and subvert our country. This rebellion is organized and premeditated, with both domestic and international factors. The occurrence of the rebellion is not subject to people's will. Chairman Deng's profound analysis of the nature and roots of this counter-revolutionary rebellion has made us more deeply understand the inevitability, complexity, and long-term nature of this struggle. Some party committees of various units have realized the importance of summarizing experiences and lessons through study. They said that Chairman Deng had solemnly pointed out that we must seriously summarize the experiences and lessons of the past decade of reform and give full play to the political advantages of our Party. However, due to various reasons, this correct instruction has not been implemented. This counter-revolutionary rebellion is the result of promoting bourgeois liberalization. One of the lessons of our Party is that in the new situation of reform and opening up, ideological education has been weakened, the spirit of hard work and self-reliance has been weakened, and the Four Cardinal Principles have not been persistently upheld. This mistake is very profound and deserves to be remembered forever and corrected resolutely.

Some units have deepened their understanding in the following aspects through study and discussion: First, they have further clarified the inevitability of this counter-revolutionary rebellion. This incident has prompted us to calmly consider the past and the future, summarize experiences and lessons, and make our future steps more stable, better, and faster. Second, they have further clarified the essence and harm of this rebellion. The Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission have taken decisive measures to suppress the rebellion, which is very wise and correct. Third, they have further clarified the important role played by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries in suppressing this rebellion. Fourth, they have further clarified the great responsibility of the army in this struggle.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech has greatly inspired and urged the party committees and the broad masses of cadres and soldiers of various units. Many comrades said that Chairman Deng has given high praise to the troops for their loyalty to the Party, loyalty to the people, obedience to orders, strict discipline, fearlessness of hardship and sacrifice, and dedication to duty in this suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion. This is the Party and the people's encouragement and urging to the troops. We are the people's army and must always closely unite around the Party Central Committee, defend the interests of the Party and the people, protect the people's fruits of labor, and maintain social stability. The People's Liberation Army is the iron wall built by the Party. We will never allow anyone to attempt to overthrow the Communist Party, overthrow the socialist system, and subvert the People's Republic of China. The facts have proven that our Party has the ability to lead the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country to overcome all obstacles on the road ahead and ensure that the correct line, principles, and policies formulated since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee are consistently implemented, building our country to be more stable and prosperous.

The broad masses of cadres and soldiers have expressed that although the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion has achieved initial success, the tasks ahead are still arduous and complex, and we must not relax our vigilance. We must ensure that in any severe situation, we remain consistent with the Party Central Committee in our thoughts, politics, and actions. Through this test and tempering of suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the troops will better love the masses, fulfill their duties, and severely crack down on a handful of rioters. With the image of a mighty and civilized army, and with more effective measures and actions, we will contribute to the complete suppression of the rebellion and the maintenance of stability and unity.

　　解放军三总部和各大单位
    传达学习邓小平同志重要讲话
    为彻底平息反革命暴乱而奋斗
    新华社北京６月１２日电  人民解放军各总部、各大单位认真传达学习中央军委主席邓小平在接见戒严部队军以上干部时的重要讲话，表示要坚决听党的话，忠于人民，为取得制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱、稳定局势的彻底胜利而奋斗。
    连日来，总参谋部、总政治部、总后勤部、北京军区，沈阳军区、济南军区、南京军区、广州军区、成都军区、兰州军区、空军、海军、第二炮兵、国防科工委、国防大学、军事科学院等单位党委分别召开了党委会、机关干部大会，认真传达、学习邓小平同志的讲话。通过学习讨论，大家对首都反革命暴乱的实质及其根源、老一辈无产阶级革命家在党和国家生死存亡的关键时刻所起的决定性作用、我军在保卫祖国和巩固人民民主专政中的重要作用等问题有了深刻的认识。许多同志说，在平息反革命暴乱取得初步胜利的时候，邓主席亲切接见戒严部队的领导同志并作重要讲话，这对于统一全党、全军和全国人民的思想，粉碎少数阴谋分子的反革命谣言，从根本上稳定当前的局势，将产生不可估量的作用。有的老同志说，邓主席是我们党和国家真正的掌舵人，特别是党的十一届三中全会以来，在每一个关键时刻，都是他给我们指明了方向。在这次党和国家命运处于危险的紧要关头，又是他挺身而出，以无产阶级革命家的雄伟气魄和胆略，率领全党、全军和全国人民粉碎了这场反革命暴乱，挽救了社会主义事业，保住了１０年改革的成果。
    在学习讨论中，大家进一步明确了这场斗争的性质。许多同志说，邓主席对这场斗争的性质讲得非常透彻。极少数人要民主、反腐败只是个陪衬，其实质是要推翻共产党，否定社会主义制度，颠覆我们的国家。这场暴乱是有组织、有预谋的，既有国内的原因，又有国际的因素。暴乱的发生是不以人们意志为转移的。邓主席对这场反革命暴乱的性质和根源作了精辟的分析，使我们更加深刻地认识到这场斗争的必然性、复杂性和长期性。一些单位的党委通过学习，认识到总结经验教训的重要性。他们说，邓主席曾语重心长地指出，要认真总结１０年改革的经验教训，要发挥我们党的政治优势。但是由于种种原因，这一正确的指示，并没有得到贯彻落实。这场反革命暴乱是搞资产阶级自由化产生的恶果。我们党的一条教训就是，在改革开放新形势下，思想教育削弱了，艰苦创业精神削弱了，没有持之以恒地坚持四项基本原则。这一失误的教训极其深刻，值得永远记取，并应坚决予以纠正。
    还有一些单位经过学习讨论，在以下几个方面加深了思想认识：一是进一步明确了发生这场反革命暴乱的必然性。这次事件促使我们冷静地考虑过去，考虑未来，总结经验教训，将使我们今后的步子走得更稳、更好、更快。二是进一步明确了这场暴乱的实质和危害。党中央、国务院、中央军委采取果断措施平息暴乱，非常英明，非常正确。三是进一步明确了老一辈无产阶级革命家在平息这场暴乱中所起的重要作用。四是进一步明确了军队在这场斗争中的重大责任。
    邓小平同志的讲话，使各单位党委和广大指战员受到巨大鼓舞和鞭策。许多同志说邓主席对部队在这次平息反革命暴乱中所表现出的忠于党，忠于人民，听从指挥，严守纪律，不怕艰苦牺牲，忠于职守的行动给予很高评价，这是党和人民对部队的鼓舞和鞭策。我们是人民军队，就要时刻紧密团结在党中央周围，捍卫党的利益、人民的利益，保卫人民的劳动成果，维护社会的安定。人民解放军是党缔造的钢铁长城，我们任何时候都不允许有人企图打倒共产党，推翻社会主义制度，颠覆中华人民共和国。事实已经证明，我们的党完全有力量领导全党、全军、全国人民排除前进道路上的一切阻力，保证党的十一届三中全会以来制订的正确路线方针政策坚持不断地贯彻下去，把国家建设得更稳定繁荣。
    广大指战员表示，这次平息反革命暴乱的斗争虽然取得初步胜利，但是今后的任务仍然是艰巨复杂的，不能有松劲思想，还要保持高度的警惕。要保证在任何严峻的情况下，在思想上、政治上、行动上坚决同党中央保持一致。通过这次镇压反革命暴乱的锻炼和考验，部队要更好地热爱人民群众，履行职责，严厉打击一小撮暴徒。以威武之师、文明之师的形象，以更有效的措施和行动，为彻底平息暴乱，维护安定团结做出贡献。
