	Beijing "Workers' Autonomous Federation" Two Leaders Arrested
	Public Security Authorities Uncover "Capital Workers' Special Patrol Squad"

	The People's Daily, Hohhot, June 15 — Liu Qiang, a leader of the Beijing "Workers' Autonomous Federation" who was wanted by the Beijing Public Security Bureau, was apprehended this morning in Wuchuan County, Inner Mongolia.

	Liu Qiang left Beijing on June 9 on the 263rd train and arrived in Hohhot the next day. He stayed at the home of his cousin, Ma Bingying, who works at the Inner Mongolia Finance and Taxation School. On June 14, he went with his father to the home of Ma Bingying's brother in Wuchuan County.

	Last night, Ma Bingying saw on television that Liu Qiang was a wanted man and immediately reported him. The Hohhot Public Security Bureau, based on the report, immediately dispatched six officers to pursue and capture him. At 7:30 this morning, they arrested him in Wuchuan County.

	The People's Daily, Beijing, June 15 — The main leader of the Beijing "Workers' Autonomous Federation," Liu Huanwen, has been apprehended by the public security authorities.

	Liu Huanwen was arrested by the Shijiazhuang Public Security Bureau in the city area on the afternoon of June 13. Liu Huanwen, 28, was originally a worker at Capital Iron and Steel Company. He joined the "Workers' Autonomous Federation" after seven days of student hunger strike in Beijing. He personally organized the "Workers' Autonomous Federation Workers' Patrol Squad" and served as the commander-in-chief. Later, he developed and appointed seven squad leaders. During the counter-revolutionary rebellion, he organized and participated in the storming of Xinhuamen, setting up roadblocks in Tiananmen Square, and burning military vehicles in six locations including Liubukou, Gongzhufen, Muxidi, Fuxingmen, and others.

	According to a message from the Beijing Public Security Bureau on June 14: With the assistance of the martial law troops, the Beijing Public Security Bureau successfully uncovered the illegal organization "Capital Workers' Special Patrol Squad" and apprehended 16 members led by Liu Zihou.

	The predecessor of this organization was called the "Beijing Citizens' Hunger Strike Team and Suicide Squad." Its leader, Liu Zihou, a 33-year-old employee of the Beijing Fishery Company, and its members were mostly unemployed and idle people. They were controlled and directed by the "High Autonomous Federation" and received activity funds and materials from the "High Autonomous Federation." They directly participated in creating disturbances and counter-revolutionary rebellion activities. They set up strongholds and tents in the square, calling it the "Free Zone." Since the imposition of martial law, they have been dispatched by the "High Autonomous Federation" to surround and intercept the martial law troops of the People's Liberation Army in Huangtugang, Hujialou, and Liuliqiao. They set up roadblocks in the Tiananmen area, using Molotov cocktails provided by the "High Autonomous Federation" to burn military vehicles and armored vehicles, and participated in the erection of the so-called "Goddess" statue in Tiananmen Square. After June 4, they continued to secretly organize and plan to escape abroad.
