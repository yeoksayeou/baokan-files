You have achieved initial victory in suppressing the serious counter-revolutionary riots in the capital. On behalf of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the people of all ethnic groups in the country, and on behalf of the Chairman of the People's Republic of China, Yang Shangkun, I extend my warm greetings to you and salute you with the highest respect! Your high morale, I will report to the Chairman of the Military Commission, Deng Xiaoping."

Wang Zhen said: "You have bravely defended the People's Republic of China, which was created by the blood and sacrifices of tens of millions of revolutionary martyrs, defended the sacred Constitution, defended the achievements of ten years of reform and opening up, and defended the solemn capital. You are indeed the loyal guardians of the people, the strong pillars of the people's democratic dictatorship. The Party and the government thank you, and the people of all ethnic groups in the country thank you. The great merits you have established for the great Chinese nation and for the cause of socialist modernization will be forever inscribed in the glorious annals of the People's Republic of China."

Wang Zhen said: "Comrades, the serious counter-revolutionary riots in the capital have not yet been completely suppressed. I sincerely hope that you will continue to press forward and achieve further victories. You must continue to severely crack down on a small number of counter-revolutionary rioters without mercy. You must continue to protect the lives and property of the broad masses of the people with all your heart and with all your might. For the sake of defending the fundamental principles of the state, for the sake of advancing the great cause of construction and reform, you must achieve new merits."

In his concluding remarks, Vice Chairman Wang Zhen led the officers and soldiers of the martial law troops in shouting slogans: "Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live the People's Republic of China! Long live the People's Liberation Army!"

The officers and soldiers of the martial law troops were filled with enthusiasm, repeatedly raising their arms and shouting: "Defend the Party Central Committee resolutely! Defend the People's Republic resolutely! Suppress the counter-revolutionary riots resolutely! Complete the martial law mission resolutely!"
