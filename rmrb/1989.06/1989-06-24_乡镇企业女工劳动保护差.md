	Labor Protection for Women Workers in Township Enterprises is Inadequate

	As township enterprises have risen, issues such as environmental pollution, occupational poisoning, labor hygiene, and occupational diseases have become increasingly prominent in rural areas. The maternal and child health department of Jiading County, Shanghai, conducted a survey of 967 township enterprises in the county and found that a significant number of factories have serious issues with labor protection for women workers.

	Out of the 967 surveyed township enterprises, there are a total of 132,934 employees, of which 69,864 are women, accounting for 52.6%. 58.9% of the factories have hazardous occupations, with 17,972 women workers exposed to these hazardous conditions, making up 54% of the total number of workers exposed to hazardous occupations.

	The products of these factories are mostly those that have been transferred or relocated from large urban enterprises. The equipment is outdated, and the technology is backward. The workers are mainly those who have transitioned from farming to industrial work and have little knowledge of industrial hygiene and occupational disease prevention.

	Factory management also does not pay much attention to environmental monitoring and labor protection. Only 17.9% of the enterprises have health and hygiene rooms, only 8.4% have women's bathrooms, and 3% do not even have women's restrooms.

	Women workers' health measures during menstruation, pregnancy, maternity leave, and lactation periods are largely not implemented. They basically do not have rest during menstruation, and after seven months of pregnancy, they do not have breaks during work.

	91.4% of the factories do not have lactation rooms. Some provide lactation time, but production quotas must still be met without reducing output. 71.7% of women who are seven months pregnant and 70.2% of lactating women have to work night shifts and overtime.

	The industrial hazards and neglect of labor protection are gradually revealing their direct and potential impacts on women workers. Therefore, the investigators call on relevant departments to pay attention to and address these issues.

### 乡镇企业女工劳动保护差

　　乡镇企业女工劳动保护差
    随着乡镇企业的崛起，农村中环境污染、职业中毒、劳动卫生、职业病等问题也渐见突出。上海嘉定县妇幼保健部门对该县９６７个乡镇企业作了调查，发现其中大部分工厂的女工劳动保护存在着严重的问题。
    被调查的９６７个乡镇企业，共有职工１３２９３４人，其中女职工６９８６４人，占５２．６％。５８．９％的工厂具有有害工种，接触有害工种的女工１７９７２人，占接触有害工种总人数的５４％。
    这些工厂的产品大都是由城市大企业下放或转产的，设备陈旧、工艺落后，生产者大量是从务农转到务工的，对工业劳动卫生和职业病防治知之甚少。
    工厂的干部对环境监测和劳动防护也不重视。企业中，有卫生保健室的工厂只占１７．９％，仅有８．４％的工厂有女浴室，３％的工厂连女厕所都没有。
    女工的经期、孕期、产假和哺乳期的各项保健措施大部分得不到落实。她们基本上经期无休息，怀孕７个月后也没有工间休息。
    ９１．４％工厂无哺乳室，有的给予哺乳时间，但生产指标照样要完成，不能减少产量。有７１．７％的妊娠７个月女工和７０．２％的哺乳期女工要上夜班和加班。
    工业危害和忽视劳动保护给女工带来的直接和潜在影响，正在逐渐显露出来。为此，调查者呼吁各有关部门加以重视和解决。
