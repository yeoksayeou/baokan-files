The World Wildlife Fund has called for an immediate ban on the ivory trade to save elephants from extinction.

According to the latest research report, if poaching is not stopped, African elephants will become extinct within 50 years. The report states that the number of African elephants has decreased by 50% in the past 10 years, from 1.3 million in 1979 to 625,000 today. Approximately 10% of the elephant population is killed each year.

The 102 signatory countries of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora are scheduled to meet in Switzerland this October to discuss the issue of banning the ivory trade.

The chairman of the Wildlife Fund, Train, said that it is crucial for the United States and the European Community to immediately ban the import of ivory.

　　世界野生生物基金会呼吁
    挽救大象　禁止象牙交易
    新华社华盛顿电  世界野生生物基金会６月１日呼吁立即禁止象牙交易，以挽救大象免于灭绝。
    据最新研究报告表明，如果偷猎现象不加制止，非洲大象将在５０年内灭绝。报告说，非洲象的数量在最近１０年中减少了５０％，从１９７９年的１３０万头降到今年的６２．５万头。每年约有１０％的大象惨遭捕杀。
    保护濒于灭绝动物国际条约的１０２个签约国计划于今年１０月在瑞士开会，讨论禁止象牙交易问题。
    野生生物基金会主席特雷恩说，美国和欧洲共同体立即禁止象牙进口是至关重要的。
