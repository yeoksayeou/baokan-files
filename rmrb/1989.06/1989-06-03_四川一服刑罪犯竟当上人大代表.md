A convicted criminal who was serving a sentence has been elected as a People's Representative in Jianyang County, Sichuan. Two years later, in April of this year, this "secret" was revealed when the "representative" was arrested by the procuratorate for another case. Recently, the Jianyang County People's Congress Standing Committee has revoked the representative status of this individual.

The criminal, Pan Dachang, is a villager from Luguang Township in Jianyang County. In 1963, Pan was sentenced to two years of re-education through labor for vagrancy and theft. In September 1977, he was placed under surveillance for three years for embezzlement and fraud. In 1980, while being detained and investigated for stealing timber, he escaped while awaiting trial. After escaping, Pan was hired as a purchasing agent by a supply and marketing cooperative in Wengjiang County in 1980. In 1981, he was sentenced to six years in prison for embezzling 9,616 yuan. At that time, due to his "paralyzed lower limbs," he was released on medical parole on December 5, 1983.

During his medical parole, Pan took over the management of the Jianyang New Hua Food Factory. Later, he raised funds and loans to establish the Jianyang Hemp Textile Mill, where he served as the director.

On January 20, 1987, Pan was elected as a county People's Representative during the 10th Jianyang County People's Congress.

According to Mao Zhiliang, the former Party Secretary of Luguang Township and the director of the township election committee, Pan was selected as a representative because he was seen as an enterprising individual with many external connections and was considered a capable person. Regarding his criminal record, we were indeed unaware and did not think to investigate his history.

A report from the Jianyang County People's Congress Standing Committee stated: Pan Dachang was sentenced in Wengjiang County. Only the original township documents and the township security personnel who signed and stamped for his medical parole knew about this situation; no one else was aware. Therefore, under these specific historical conditions, the township Party committee nominated and recommended Pan Dachang as a candidate for representative, and the broad masses of voters elected him as a county People's Representative, which is understandable.

The investigation report from the Sichuan Provincial People's Procuratorate pointed out: The occurrence of this incident was "due to Pan's concealment of his criminal identity and lax examination."

Currently, Pan Dachang has been detained for investigation.

    四川一服刑罪犯竟当上人大代表
    本报讯　一个正在服刑的罪犯，居然当上了四川省简阳县的人民代表。事隔两年后的今年4月，该“代表”因涉嫌另一案件被检察机关收审时，这一“秘密”才被揭露。最近，简阳县人大常委会已罢免了该“代表”的代表资格。
    罪犯潘大章，是简阳县石板区卢葭乡村民，1963年，潘因流窜扒窃，被劳教二年，1977年9月，因贪污、诈骗被管制三年。1980年因盗伐林木，在收容审查中畏罪脱逃。潘大章脱逃后，于1980年被温江县一个供销社经理部聘为采购员，1981年潘因贪污现金9616元被判刑6年。当时因潘犯“下肢瘫痪”，于1983年12月5日保外就医。
    潘犯在保外就医期间，承包了简阳新华食品厂，后又集资‘贷款’办起了简阳麻纺厂并自任厂长。
    1987年1月20日，潘犯在简阳县第十届人民代表大会上被选为县人大代表。
    据简阳县卢葭乡当年的党委书记、乡选举委员会主任毛志良说：对于选潘当人大代表，是看他办企业有开拓精神，外面关系多，是个能人。对于他被判刑的问题，我们确实不清楚，也没想过要查一下他的历史。
    简阳县人大常委会的一份报告中认为：潘大章是在温江县被判刑的。这一情况仅有为潘大章保外就医签字盖章的原乡文书及乡治安员知道，其它便无人知晓。因此，在这种特定的历史条件下，乡党委提名推荐潘大章作为代表候选人，广大选民投票选举他为县人大代表，是可以理解的。
    四川省人民检察院的调查报告指出：这一事件的发生，是“因潘犯隐瞒犯罪身份和审查不严所致”。
    目前，潘大章已被收容审查。
