    New Insights from Comparative Studies of Writers
    – Reading "A Comparative Study of Lu Xun and Guo Moruo"
    Huang Houxing

    Zhang Enhe's "A Comparative Study of Lu Xun and Guo Moruo" (published by Tianjin People's Publishing House) provides a relatively systematic comparative study of two literary giants who made significant contributions to modern Chinese cultural thought and represented the direction of development. Compared to some past simplistic comparisons or biased criticisms, this work shows clear progress and breakthroughs in its stance and comparative methods.

    In conducting vertical and horizontal comparisons of the writers, "A Comparative Study" pays attention to multi-faceted historical examinations, considering the writers' entire lives, their complete works, and the objective environments in which they lived. The book is divided into three parts: "Overall Comparison," "Parallel Comparison," and "Intersecting Comparison." It grasps the differences in the lives, times, environments, families, and experiences of Lu Xun and Guo Moruo, analyzing the formation of their patriotic and democratic thoughts from these differences, and the factors that shaped their personalities, temperaments, and aesthetic tastes. It also explains their political views, philosophical views, literary views, and various literary creations from a parallel perspective, using their similarities and differences to argue their contributions to the cultural cause of the Chinese nation and comparing their differences in creative thought and artistic pursuits.

    Engels said, "The literary value of any individual is not determined by himself, but only in comparison with the whole." Another feature of "A Comparative Study" is its comprehensive examination of the different achievements of Lu Xun and Guo Moruo since the May Fourth Movement, comparing them with their contemporaries in the context of society, politics, and culture, thereby arguing that Lu Xun and Guo Moruo are the "twin stars" of the brilliant constellation of new literature. This overall comparison is a broader and deeper excavation based on individual comparisons, leading the research work to a deeper level. "A Comparative Study" has made many beneficial attempts in this regard.

    In the intersecting comparison, regarding the relationship between Lu Xun and Guo Moruo and the disputes that occurred between them, "A Comparative Study" avoids the past tendency of "suppressing Guo and elevating Lu" or "blaming Lu and defending Guo," striving to reflect on the matter with a realistic attitude. The author does not analyze whether the contradictions between them belong to sectarianism or factionalism but compares, from multiple angles, the various entanglements formed due to their differing experiences, thoughts, personalities, temperaments, and tastes, as well as the influence of leftist social and literary trends, and the resulting mistakes or misunderstandings, making the arguments more convincing. In short, the book emphasizes the analysis of essence in bilateral comparisons, that is, the consistency of Lu Xun and Guo Moruo in the great revolutionary goal, and draws conclusions that conform to the facts from their internal connections and development.

　　作家比较研究的新收获    
    ——读《鲁迅与郭沫若比较论》
    黄侯兴
    张恩和的《鲁迅与郭沫若比较论》（天津人民出版社出版），对于在中国现代文化思想史上有过重大贡献并且可以代表发展方向的两位文豪，作了较系统的比较研究。比之过去某些简单化的类比或自挟成见的批评，它在立论的态度和比较的方法上，都有明显的进步与突破。
    《比较论》在对作家进行纵横比较时，注意到了多层面的历史考察，即顾及作家的全人、他们的全部作品及其生活的客观环境。它将全书分为“总体比较”、“平行比较”、“交叉比较”三篇。既从总体上把握了鲁、郭生活的时代、环境、家庭、经历的差别，从差别中分析他们的爱国主义、民主主义思想形成的过程，他们的性格气质、审美情趣培育的因素；又从平行上阐释了他们的政治观、哲学观、文艺观及各种文学创作等的异同，从异同中论证他们在文化事业上对中华民族作出的奉献，比较了他们在创作思想与艺术追求上的差异。
    恩格斯说：“任何一个人在文学上的价值都不是由他自己决定的，而只是同整体的比较当中决定的。”《比较论》的另一个特点，就是全面考察了自“五四”以来各个历史阶段鲁迅、郭沫若的不同业绩，从社会的、政治的、文化的大背景中把他们与同时代人进行“整体的比较”，从而论证鲁迅、郭沫若是新文学灿烂群星中的“双子巨星”。这种整体比较，是在单项比较的基础上作更广泛、更深层的开掘，把研究工作引向深入。《比较论》在这方面作了许多有益的尝试。
    在交叉比较中，就鲁迅与郭沫若的关系，他们之间发生过的龃龉，《比较论》避免了过去存在的“抑郭扬鲁”或“责鲁袒郭”的倾向，力求用实事求是的态度进行反思。作者没有就他们之间是否属于宗派主义、小集团主义的矛盾性质进行辨析，而是多视角地比较了他们之间由于经历、思想、性格、气质、情趣迥然有别，加之“左”的社会思潮、文艺思潮的影响形成的种种纠葛，以及由此出现的失误或误解，因而更令人信服。总之，该书在双向比较中注重本质的分析，即鲁、郭在革命大目标方面的一致性，从他们内在的联系和发展去作出合乎事实的结论。
