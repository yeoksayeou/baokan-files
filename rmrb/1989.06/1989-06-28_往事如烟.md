	The Past Like Smoke
	Yu Haijun

	Back then, for the sake of a love, I was studying in a small town far away.
	Alone in a distant land, I experienced all my joys and sorrows by myself.
	My heart was left in my hometown, on that rain-soaked path. And I, I was left with only an empty shell, battered by wind and rain, which my pen could never fill. Night after night, I repeated a lonely dream, but the person I longed for never appeared.
	Moreover, dreams and reality were always two different worlds.
	For countless days, I thought everything would fade away, but loneliness persisted, disturbing my sleep! If it were just tears in my eyes, it would be tolerable. But my heart was enduring, finding no moment to burst out. The suppressed pain had no outlet, and that sorrow would accompany me for life.
	Every evening, on the path outside the window, there would be a pair of sad eyes, silent, motionless, voiceless, every day, every day. I felt ashamed, grateful, and at a loss. And the music in the house every evening was always a sad song. In the years to come, I did not have more tears, only because all my tears were given to that one moment of emotion.
	For that boy's gaze, for that every day, I was sent to the small town, which was indeed a distant land. Before leaving, I dared not look back to see if there were people waving on the balcony. My heart was like ashes, carrying my bag along the path, like a wandering traveler. Everything was the same, but my eyes were filled with emptiness. The sunset was beautiful and romantic, but for whom?
	Years later, that boy—Qiuyin—has been my good friend for a long time. And I, I have found the love of my life.
	Qiuyin's appearance from back then has faded, but in my memory, there is still a faint image of a denim jacket. His gaze, however, has never changed, always a sweet reminder in my heart, urging me not to give up on myself.
	Now, I live in the arms of my beloved. Back then, with Qiuyin, we also played games with three people. When I suddenly walked down that path again, I could only smile slightly and say "thank you" in my heart.
	What is a moment? A moment is eternity. Perhaps Qiuyin's heart no longer holds that eternal moment from back then. The past is like smoke, but it leaves behind not emptiness after passing by.
	After all, the past is always a light rain in late spring, a tear on the face of a first love, forever beautiful like a good dream.

　　往事如烟
    于海琼
    当年，为了一段感情，我远在小城读书。
    只身天涯，喜怒哀乐都做给自己看。
    那时的心留在故乡，留在那条初雨的甬路上。而我，只剩下一个被风雨噬坏了的空壳，用笔永远也填不满，夜夜重复一个孤寂的梦，梦中总不见思念的人。
    而且，梦幻和现实总是两个世界。
    多少日子，本以为一切会淡淡无烟，却不料寂寞不散，扰我梦酣！如单单是眼中的泪，倒也罢了，偏偏有心在忍着，找不到爆发的一刻，那抑郁的苦楚无以倾诉，那份伤情，怕要伴我今生。
    每到黄昏，窗外的甬路上便多了一双忧郁的眼睛，没有言语没有动作没有声音，每天，每天。我惭愧，我感激，我不知所措。而傍晚家里的音乐也每每是一首伤感的歌。今后的许多年里我不曾有更多的泪，只因为泪都给了那一次感动。
    为了那个男孩的目光，为了那个每天。我被送到小城，那里确是天涯。临走，不敢回头看阳台上是否有挥手的亲人，心如死灰，拎着包走在甬路上，像个流浪的游子，一切都是原貌，可眼底又是一片茫然。黄昏美得浪漫，可夕阳为谁？
    几年后的现在，那个男孩——秋音，已是我做了很久的好朋友。而我，也已有了今生最爱的人。
    秋音当年的模样已模糊，记忆里依稀残存着一件牛仔布夹克，可他的目光至今总也不会变，一直都是我心中的一颗糖，我不敢轻尝，却一直在提醒我不放弃自己。
    如今，我活在爱人的臂膀里。那时，和秋音也玩三个人的游戏，突然又走上那条甬路时，我只会微微地笑一下，心里说声“谢谢”。
    一瞬是什么？一瞬是永恒。此时秋音的心中也许已不再装住当年那个永恒的一瞬。往事如烟，可它飘过后给我留下的并不是空。
    其实，往事，总是暮春里的一场小雨，初恋情人脸上的一滴泪，永远像好梦一般美丽。
