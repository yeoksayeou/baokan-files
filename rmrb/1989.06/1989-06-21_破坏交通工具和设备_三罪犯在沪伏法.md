Three criminals involved in the serious disturbance at the Guangxin Road railway crossing in Shanghai, who were convicted of sabotage of transportation vehicles and facilities, were executed today.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 21 (Correspondent Zhong Yuan, Reporter Chen Mao Di) - On June 15, the Shanghai Intermediate People's Court sentenced Xu Guoming, Bian Hanwu, and Yan Xuehong to death for their roles in the serious disturbance at the Guangxin Road railway crossing. The three defendants appealed the verdict. The Shanghai Higher People's Court ruled yesterday to uphold the original verdict, confirming that the facts were clear and the evidence was conclusive, and that the sentencing was appropriate. The court rejected the appeals of Xu Guoming and the other two defendants, maintaining the original verdict.

Zhao Jianming, Ai Qilong, Yuan Zhimin, and Sun Manhong were sentenced to 12 to 5 years in prison for sabotage of transportation vehicles and for disturbing public order.
