Title: No Offering of Cigarettes or Pressuring to Drink Alcohol

Offering cigarettes and pressuring to drink alcohol are traditional customs in China and across the broader Eastern society. Friends meeting for the first time will often say, "Have a cigarette." When male guests visit, the host will first offer them a cigarette as a sign of respect. Friends gathering, colleagues in meetings—it's common to see one person offering a cigarette to another, as if the more cigarettes offered, the more generous and impressive the person seems. When hosting a meal, only serving fine wines can show the host's prestige. Even if the guest doesn't drink or has a low tolerance, the host will insistently encourage them to drink, sometimes even forcing them, as if not getting the person drunk would be disrespectful. Using cigarettes and alcohol as gifts is also widespread, leading to bad social habits like "getting things done with Maotai" and "you have a request, I need to 'study' (cigarettes and alcohol)."

I have worked abroad for many years and have interacted with many foreigners. I found that Westerners, including Latin Americans, do not have the custom of offering cigarettes or alcohol or using them as gifts. Regardless of the occasion, smoking is a personal matter. Whether among friends, colleagues, or superiors, those who smoke will smoke their own cigarettes, and no one offers cigarettes to others.

Once, I visited a friend's home. During our conversation, my friend smoked one cigarette after another but did not offer me any, nor did he ask if I wanted one. At the time, I thought, "This person really doesn't know etiquette, only caring about his own smoking habit and not even offering a cigarette to the guest!" Later, I noticed that many other foreigners were the same. When they visited my home, those who smoked brought their own cigarettes, and I didn't need to worry about whether they smoked or not. Upon reflection, this custom of not offering cigarettes is quite reasonable, because everyone knows that smoking is harmful. If that's the case, why bother offering cigarettes to harm others? For the same reason, Western society does not use cigarettes and alcohol as gifts. Generally, gifts are things like picture books, books, ordinary handicrafts, or souvenirs.

When it comes to drinking, Western customs are also different from China's. Whether at a family dinner or a large reception, the various beverages prepared on the table, including mineral water, soda, fruit juice, beer, or hard liquor, guests and hosts serve themselves, taking what they want. At family dinners, the host pouring drinks for guests or guests toasting each other is common, but no one will pressure others to drink, let alone try to get them drunk.

I often think: China is promoting modern science and civilization. This outdated custom of using cigarettes and alcohol to show respect should be abolished.

### 不请烟不劝酒

　　不请烟不劝酒
    本报记者  兰才基
    请烟和劝酒在我国以至整个东方社会是一种传统习俗，朋友见面，先“来一支”。男客人光临，首先递烟，以表敬意。朋友们聚会，同事们开会，常常是你一支，我一支地互递香烟，似乎谁请烟多，谁就表现得豪爽、气派。请客吃饭，只有用好酒、名酒招待才显出主人脸面光彩。即使客人不会喝酒或酒量不大，主人也殷勤相劝，甚至强人所难，似乎不把人灌醉就不成敬意。用烟酒送礼更是普遍，以至形成“办事靠茅台”，“你有请求，我要‘研究’（烟酒）”等不良社会风气。
    我在国外工作多年，接触不少外国人士，发现西方人包括拉美人没有这种请烟敬酒或用烟酒送礼的习俗。不管在什么场合，吸烟都是自备，亲朋故友也好，同仁上级也好，聚会时，吸烟者各吸各的，谁也不给谁递烟。
    有一次，我去一位友人家作客，这位朋友坐着聊天时，自己点烟吸了一支又一支，但就是不给我递烟，也不问我想不想吸一支。当时我心里嘀咕：“此人真不懂礼节，只管自己过烟瘾，不招待一下客人！”后来我觉察到其他许多外国人也是如此，他们到我家作客，会吸烟的都是自备，用不着去理会他们吸烟还是不吸烟。细一想来，这种不请烟不递烟的习俗是不无道理的，因为吸烟有害，尽人皆知，既然如此，又何必去请烟加害于人呢？出于同样理由，西方社会也不兴以烟酒之类物品作为礼物馈赠朋友，一般送礼多是画册、书籍、普通工艺品或纪念品等。
    说到喝酒，西方习俗也与中国不同，不论家宴或举办大型招待会，餐桌上所备的各种饮料，包括矿泉水、汽水、果汁、啤酒或烈性酒，宾主都是自己动手，各取所需，想喝什么就倒什么。家宴上，主人给宾客倒酒或者互相碰碰杯也是有的，但谁也不会劝酒，更不会想方设法把你灌醉。
    我常想：中国正在提倡现代科学与文明，用烟酒敬人这种陈规陋俗，也应该革除掉。
