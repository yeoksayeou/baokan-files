Prague, the "Garden of Central Europe," has been severely affected by environmental pollution in recent years. According to a report in the *Prague Evening News*, the concentration of sulfur dioxide in the air of most parts of the city exceeds the standard by 30%. During winter when weather conditions are poor, it can even exceed the standard by 19 times. The amount of dust in the air also exceeds the allowable limit by one times.

The Vltava River, which meanders through the city center, is also seriously polluted. Its water quality has deteriorated from level 2 at the entrance to level 4 at the exit. None of the drinking water sources for Prague residents meet the standards for use by infants and young children.

Long-term residents of Prague are experiencing declining health. The city has the highest disease rate in the country. The number of children suffering from congenital kidney diseases, lung diseases, and allergic diseases is higher than the national average. The number of spontaneous abortions among pregnant women is also higher than in other regions. In recent years, the number of residents diagnosed with malignant tumors has been increasing.

The pollution problem in Prague has attracted the attention of the federal government and local leaders, who have taken some measures to address it.

　　布拉格环境污染严重
    据新华社布拉格６月１日电  据《布拉格晚报》报道，布拉格这座“中欧花园”的古城近年来深受环境污染的困扰，该城大部分地区空气中的二氧化硫的含量超过标准的３０％。冬季气候条件不好时，甚至超过标准的１９倍，空气中飞尘量超过允许量的１倍。
    蜿蜒流经市中心的伏尔塔瓦河也被严重污染，其清洁度已从入口处的２级降到出口处的４级，布拉格人的饮水水源无一达到婴幼儿使用的标准。
    长期生活在这种环境中的布拉格居民的健康水平每况愈下。市民患病率居全国之首，儿童患先天性肾病、肺病和过敏性疾病的人数高于全国平均水平。孕妇自然流产者也多于其他州。近年来，布拉格居民患恶性肿瘤的病人也不断增加。
    布拉格的污染问题已引起联邦政府和市领导的关注，并采取了一些治理措施。
