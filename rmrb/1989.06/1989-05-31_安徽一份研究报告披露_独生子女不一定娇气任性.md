A report from Anhui reveals that only children, often perceived as spoiled, willful, and aloof, actually excel in areas such as kindness, altruism, bravery, and honesty compared to non-only children.

The report, provided by the Anhui Provincial Urban Socio-Economic Sample Survey Team, also confirms that these so-called "little emperors" do not significantly differ from non-only children in terms of sociability, gentleness, and adaptability.

The survey, which included 435 preschool and some school-aged children, presents the following data: 74.3% of only children are willing to share their toys with other children or offer snacks to others, compared to 63% of non-only children; 43.4% of only children can get along well with peers and resolve minor conflicts by compromising, compared to 32.6% of non-only children; 44% of only children have independent opinions in daily life, compared to 37% of non-only children; 32.8% of only children admit their mistakes and do not hide them, compared to 32.6% of non-only children; 22.5% of only children are not afraid of strangers or unfamiliar animals and dare to go play alone, compared to 21.7% of non-only children.

Experts in child education believe that a child's character, behavior, and qualities are not determined by whether they are an only child or not. Instead, they are shaped by the social environment and educational methods they experience through life practice. Only children, due to their unique family circumstances, may develop certain negative personality traits, but with proper educational methods, their character and behavior can develop normally and healthily.

　　安徽一份研究报告披露
    独生子女不一定娇气任性
    新华社合肥５月３１日电（通讯员宋青、记者宋斌）一份研究报告表明，一向被认为娇气、任性、孤僻的“小皇帝”的独生子女，在友善、利他、勇敢诚实等方面，却优于非独生子女。
    这份由安徽省城市社会经济抽样调查队提供的报告还证实：这些被称作“小皇帝”的独生子女，在合群、温顺、适应性等方面与非独生子女并无明显差异。
    这份对４３５名学龄前和部分学龄儿童的调查报告，提供了这样一组数据：愿意把自己的玩具拿给别的小朋友玩或把点心拿给别人吃的，独生子女占７４．３％，非独生子女占６３％；能和小朋友友好相处、发生小矛盾能主动相让的，独生子女占４３．４％，非独生子女占３２．６％；在日常生活中，遇事有自己独立见解的，独生子女占４４％，非独生子女占３７％；不论做错什么事，能主动承认，不隐瞒的，独生子女占３２．８％，非独生子女占３２．６％；不怕生人和陌生动物，敢单独去某处玩的，独生子女占２２．５％，非独生子女占２１．７％。
    有关儿童教育专家认为，孩子性格、行为、品质的好坏，并不以独生或非独生为条件，而是在一定的社会生活环境中，受到一定的教育方式影响，通过生活实践而逐渐形成的。独生子女因家庭条件特殊，容易产生某些不良性格特征，但只要注意教育方式，他们的品行就会正常健康地发展。
