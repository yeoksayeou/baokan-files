The State Education Commission recently issued a notice, requiring the education commissions, bureaus (offices) of provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and separately planned cities to organize this year's high school graduates to study documents related to suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing.

The notice said that the recent counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing is a good negative example. Before the graduates leave school, local education administrative departments and schools should seize the opportunity to give them a patriotic education and a lesson on the current situation, with the main content being love for the Communist Party of China, love for socialism, and love for the People's Liberation Army.

The notice requires that schools should use Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech when he met with military officers above the rank of colonel from the capital's martial law troops as a weapon, and organize this year's high school graduates to study the following documents: "We Must Clearly Oppose the Turmoil" (April 26, 1989, People's Daily editorial), the speech by Comrades Li Peng and Yang Shangkun at the May 19 meeting of the capital's party, government, and military cadres, "A Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country," "A Programmatic Document to Unify the Thoughts of the Whole Party—Seriously Study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's Important Speech" (June 16, 1989, People's Daily editorial), "The Facts About the Counter-Revolutionary Rebellion in Beijing" (June 5, 1989, article by the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China), and "Understanding the Nature of the Turmoil and the Necessity of Martial Law" (June 2, 1989, article by the Propaganda Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China).

The notice requires that after organizing students to carefully read the above documents, schools can have the principal, party branch secretary, political instructor, or invite local party and government leaders to give a report, link it to reality, and conduct targeted guidance. They can also organize discussions appropriately. Through study, students should understand the truth about the turmoil and rebellion, recognize the nature and causes of the turmoil and rebellion, and the importance of suppressing the turmoil and rebellion. They should distinguish right from wrong, remember that without the Communist Party, there would be no New China; without adhering to the socialist road, it would be impossible to achieve the four modernizations of China; and without the people's army, there would be nothing for the people. They should support the wise decisions of the Party Central Committee and the State Council with actual actions.

The notice said that local education administrative departments and schools should, under the leadership of the local party committee, regard this educational activity as the primary task of political and ideological education for graduates, and conduct thorough research and arrangements.

    组织学习平息反革命暴乱文件  帮助应届高中毕业生明辨是非
    据新华社北京６月２０日电  国家教委近日发出通知，要求各省、自治区、直辖市、计划单列市教育委员会、教育厅（局）组织应届高中毕业生学习平息北京反革命暴乱的有关文件。
    通知说，最近在北京发生的反革命暴乱是一个很好的反面教材。各地教育行政部门和学校在应届高中毕业生离校前，应不失时机地对他们进行一次以热爱中国共产党，热爱社会主义，热爱中国人民解放军为主要内容的爱国主义教育和形势教育。
    通知要求，各学校应以邓小平同志接见首都戒严部队军以上干部时发表的重要讲话为武器，认真组织应届高中毕业生学习下列文件：《必须旗帜鲜明地反对动乱》（４月２６日《人民日报》社论）、李鹏、杨尚昆同志５月１９日《在首都党政军干部大会上的讲话》、《中共中央、国务院告全体共产党员和全国人民书》、《统一全党思想的纲领性文件——认真学习邓小平同志重要讲话》（６月１６日《人民日报》社论）、《北京发生反革命暴乱的事实真相》（中共北京市委宣传部６月５日文章）、《认清动乱的实质和戒严的必要性》（中共北京市委宣传部６月２日文章）。
    通知要求，各学校在组织学生认真阅读上列文件的基础上，可由校长、党支部书记、政治课教师或请当地党政领导干部作报告，联系实际，有针对性地进行辅导，并可适当组织讨论。通过学习，要使学生了解动乱和暴乱真相，认识动乱和暴乱的性质，发生的原因及平息动乱、暴乱的重要意义。明辨是非，牢记没有共产党就没有新中国；不坚持社会主义道路，就不可能实现中国的四个现代化；没有人民的军队便没有人民的一切，以实际行动拥护党中央、国务院的英明决策。
    通知说，各地教育行政部门和学校要在当地党委领导下，把这项教育活动作为毕业生政治思想教育工作的首要内容，认真进行研究和安排。
