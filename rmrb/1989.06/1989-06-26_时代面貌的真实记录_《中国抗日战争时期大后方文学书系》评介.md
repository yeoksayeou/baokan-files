Edition: 6

The "Series of Chinese Literature from the Rear Areas During the War of Resistance Against Japan," totaling 12 million words, 10 volumes, and 20 collections, was published by the Chongqing Publishing House on the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China and is now available to readers. This is a significant event in contemporary literary history and the cultural life of the people. Together with the "Yan'an Literary Collection" published by Hunan People's Publishing House and some literary "selections" from parts of the liberated areas, we now have a relatively complete collection of Chinese literature from the War of Resistance Against Japan (excluding novels). This is of great importance for the preservation of literary materials, research, inheritance of traditions, and patriotic education for future generations.

The "Series" is divided into 10 volumes: literary movements, theory and debates, novels, reportage, essays and miscellaneous writings, poetry, drama, film, popular literature, and works by foreigners. The selected works span from the July 7, 1937, Lugouqiao Incident to Japan's surrender on August 15, 1945, with some works extending appropriately before and after these dates. The "Series" covers the "rear areas," which basically refer to the areas under the Kuomintang's rule, excluding the liberated areas and occupied areas, and also includes Hong Kong based on its role in the literature of the resistance period.

The first volume, "Literary Movements," includes guiding documents for the culture and literature of the rear areas. It selects articles by Zhou Enlai, Guo Moruo, and Mao Dun, as well as articles by Zhang Zhizhong, Zhang Daofan, and Wang Pingling. It includes both the inaugural editorial of "Resistance Literature" and the inaugural editorial of "Literary Spring and Autumn." However, in terms of the overall quantity and quality of the "Series," it is impossible to achieve equality, which is mainly determined by historical realities.

The "Theory and Debates" volume selects works on the construction of literary theory and debates on literary issues during the resistance period in the rear areas. Notably, it includes materials from six literary debates that occurred in the rear areas over the eight years of resistance: the "popularization of literature" issue, the "exposure and satire" issue, the "irrelevance to resistance" theory, the "national form" issue, the "Warring States" faction issue, and the "subjectivism" and "life attitude" issues. The chief editor, Cai Yi, wrote a long preface summarizing and introducing these debates and their historical background.

Realism permeates the entire literature of the resistance period in the rear areas, occupying an unquestionable position. The combativity of literature was placed in the foremost position, and the cognitive function and aesthetic value of literature were intertwined in the works and critiques of this period. Resistance literature produced its social effects and gained readers' appreciation and recognition from these aspects.

In the face of the enemy's bloody butcher's knife, writers shared the same fate and hardships with the people, and their life-and-death relationship had never been as close as during the resistance period. As stated in the preface to the novel volume: "We must teach today's youth about the eight-year war of resistance in our modern history, about how their elders endured days of exile and terror, ... Some writers went to the front lines or to the enemy's rear areas to participate in the resistance, some experienced the hardships of fleeing, and some in the rear areas were also terrified by the sound of bombs and could not find peace..." The preface to the poetry volume also recalls the scenes of that time: "Whether in the south or the north, regardless of age or gender, fields, homes, peace, and warmth, everything was in ruins and suffering, ah, the mountains and rivers were filled with smoke..." Time cannot erase historical memories. Writers shared the joys and sorrows of the people, producing a fighting literature—"It cries out in pain for the suffering masses, it fights for the future of the sacred motherland! It calls for battle, it reports on the hope for the future, like a rainbow of light, it pierces the clear sky of the century, like a group of brave seagulls, it strikes the gloom of the times."

The relationship between writers and life, despite still being constrained by various human and material factors in the rear areas at that time, was broadened by the war, which drove many writers away from coastal cities to the interior and countryside, the front lines, and the enemy's rear areas, expanding their vision of life and stimulating their creative energy.

Politics, a word that was declared to be distanced and neglected in the 1980s, was a natural friend of writers during the War of Resistance Against Japan. As a universal content of life, it entered the writers' consciousness because the success or failure of the resistance determined the life and death of the nation and whether the people would be masters or slaves. Writers consciously followed the principles of "persisting in resistance, opposing surrender, persisting in unity, opposing division, persisting in progress, and opposing regression," forging them into their lives and art. Regarding this historical and literary process, Xia Yan has a good explanation: "After reading 'Germany—A Winter's Tale,' Marx said to the author Heine: 'The songs of the nightingale and the lark are beautiful, but today, Germany needs the poetry of the times.' The period of the War of Resistance Against Japan was a time of war and revolution. At that time, in the rear areas, except for Guo Moruo, Ye Shengtao, Wen Yiduo, Zhu Ziqing, and Mao Dun, the majority of writers were still hot-blooded youth in their twenties and thirties. Under these subjective and objective conditions, it was difficult to achieve the ideal of combining political content and beautiful form in the literature of the rear areas. The literature of the rear areas during the resistance period was 'the poetry of the times,' a literature overflowing with patriotic passion." (From the "General Preface")

It is precisely as "the poetry of the times" that the literature of the rear areas during the resistance period issued the roar and murmurs of that era, with its passionate and sorrowful songs, thunderous and weeping tones, composing a symphony of the Chinese nation's struggle for survival—"The Japanese invaders are slaughtering, the Chinese nation is fighting, the blood of the Chinese people is splattering, and the fire of the Chinese land is burning." (From the "Preface to the Reportage Volume")

We can temporarily set aside the artistic merits and randomly select a few titles from the easily accessible reportage, poetry, and works by foreigners: "By the Lugou Bridge," "Blood Battle at Taierzhuang," "Defending the Yellow River," "Blood-Stained Flag," "When Nanjing Was Massacred," "Chengdu, I Wake You Up," "Dreaming of Jiangnan Every Night," "1943—Chiang Kai-shek Loses the Hearts of the People," "To the Enemy's Rear Areas" ... Is this not—history of iron and fire, poetry of blood and tears! It is connected to the emotions of the entire nation's life and death, honor and disgrace, and the restless souls of millions of fallen compatriots. Should it not be remembered forever by our descendants! This is the lifeblood of Chinese literature during the entire period of the War of Resistance Against Japan (including the rear areas and the liberated areas), and the value that makes this literature eternal in literary history.

It is also a record of the times, a witness to the aggression launched by Japanese imperialism. It can serve as a warning bell for the Chinese and Japanese peoples who suffered from this war, and as a warning to the militarists in Japan who attempt to distort history.

Particularly worthy of thanks are the works by foreigners writing about the Chinese resistance, which possess greater objectivity, fairness, and moral integrity. According to the selector Lin Yaguang, this volume selected 640,000 words from 20 million words of materials, including 70 works by 40 authors. The selectors believe: "Due to the cultural consciousness, comparative perspective, and insights of the authors, these works have the value of cultural and historical reflection and contemporary significance. They still have strong vitality today. They are of reference value for researchers, literary creators, and appreciators, especially for those exploring the mystery of the vitality of literary works." (From the "Afterword" of this volume)

Under the banner of national unity, the theme of Chinese resistance literature derives its vitality from resistance and democracy. The struggle between resistance and non-resistance, democracy and anti-democracy, the sharpness and complexity of the contradictions, further enhance the literature's indignation and historical value. Xia Yan pointed out: "In the early days of the resistance, the Communist Party, the Kuomintang, and non-partisan writers could hold meetings, have discussions, and engage in collective creation (such as 'National Supremacy' during the Wuhan period and 'Yellow Flower Mound' during the Guangzhou period), and even perform on the same stage. However, after 1939, it became difficult to do so." (From the "General Preface") Most of the excellent works of the eight-year resistance literature in the rear areas were produced in the middle and later periods of the resistance, such as Ai Qing's "Torch," Lao She's "Four Generations Under One Roof," Ba Jin's "Cold Night," Guo Moruo's "Qu Yuan," Mao Dun's "Corruption," Cao Yu's "Beijing People," Xia Yan's "Fascist Bacteria," Yang Hanqing's "Spring and Autumn of the Heavenly Kingdom," Wu Zuguang's "Returning Home in the Snowy Night," Shen Congwen's "Long River," Zhang Henshui's "Eighty Years of Dreams," Sanding and Zhang Tianyi's short stories, and Ma Fan's mountain songs ... A long list of excellent works by contemporary masters can be listed in the "Series," which were produced under the strict censorship. Especially, the rise of miscellaneous writings and the large number of historical dramas. The selector Shi Man provided the historical context of the performances of the historical dramas "Spring and Autumn of the Heavenly Kingdom" and "Qu Yuan" in the "Afterword": "Yang Hanqing's 'Spring and Autumn of the Heavenly Kingdom' was written in September 1941, at a time when the Xuancheng Incident had just occurred. The author used the historical lessons of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom to condemn the crimes of the stubborn faction's infighting and sabotage of the resistance. On November 16 of that year, it was performed by the Zhonghua Drama Society at the Guotai Grand Theater in Chongqing. Whenever the character Hong Xuanjiao woke up and cried out in self-reproach: 'The enemy is at the door, we cannot kill each other!' the audience immediately erupted in thunderous applause. ... In my editing, I found that the 1944 version of 'Spring and Autumn of the Heavenly Kingdom' by Qunyi Publishing did not include the famous lines of Hong Xuanjiao mentioned earlier, obviously because of the need to pass censorship at that time, which has now been restored."

"Those who watched the performance of 'Qu Yuan' heard every line of the 'Ode to the Thunder,' and their hearts burned with fire, and their blood boiled throughout their bodies. The 'Explode, destroy!' roar ... This was Guo Moruo expressing his anger through the mouth of Qu Yuan. At that time, people everywhere responded to the poet's anger at reality. It was like a life-giving fire breaking through the gloom, spreading across the vast rear areas."

Compared to drama, film was a weak link in the rear areas at that time. The reasons and details are discussed by Zhang Junxiang in the preface to this volume. It is commendable that, despite the lack of textual materials, the selectors, with the strong support of relevant parties, overcame the difficulties and finally selected 21 films for the volume. Among them, a few were restored from the only surviving copies to scripts, filling the gaps and regaining textual materials. They did excellent work. The editors wrote in the "Afterword": "If the film volume in the 'Series of Chinese Literature from the Rear Areas During the War of Resistance Against Japan' were to be missing, we would be ashamed of our predecessors and successors." This sentiment is shared by all the selectors. The selection of popular literature and the inclusion of both old and new forms in the poetry volume are also difficult and innovative achievements. The "Series" of over 10 million words, with thousands of entries, except for the film volume, were all selected from a "census" of tens to hundreds of times the materials. The depth and breadth of the "census" vary among the volumes, but the serious and responsible attitude towards selection is consistent.

At a time when paper is expensive, the publishing industry competes for economic benefits, and the publication of serious books is difficult, Chongqing Publishing House has shown great courage and determination in undertaking the publication of this massive "Series," winning the admiration of the publishing and literary circles. The editorial board of the "Series" is pleased to have completed the editorial work, and in the "Editor's Note" at the beginning of the volumes, they wrote the following passage expressing their aspirations: "'Series' as an initial collection of important literary materials from an era, awaits the criticism of readers and the publishing industry, and further improvement. The division of the rear areas and the liberated areas during the War of Resistance Against Japan is a product of history, just as there is still a division between the mainland and Taiwan today. Literature belongs to the people, to the motherland, and to the times. We hope that in the near future, a more complete volume of Chinese 'resistance literature' from a unified region will be published, as a witness to the history of suffering in a great era, forever left to our nation's descendants."

　　时代面貌的真实记录    
    ——《中国抗日战争时期大后方文学书系》评介
    殷白
    《中国抗日战争时期大后方文学书系》，１２００万字，１０编，２０集，于中华人民共和国建国４０周年前夕由重庆出版社出版，与读者见面了。这是当代文学史和人民文化生活的一件大事。加上湖南人民出版社出的《延安文艺丛书》、部分解放区的文艺“选集”，我们有了一部（除了长篇小说外）大体完备的中国抗日战争时期的文学大全。这对于保存文学史料，研究、继承传统，和对子孙后代的爱国主义教育，都有重要作用。
    “书系”依次分为文艺运动、理论和论争、小说、报告文学、散文与杂文、诗歌、戏剧、电影、通俗文学、外国人士作品等１０编，选编作品的时限为１９３７年７月７日芦沟桥事变起，至１９４５年８月１５日日本宣告无条件投降止，个别作品有适当的上延和下延。“书系”范围的“大后方”，基本上为除解放区、沦陷区外的国民党统治区，并依据对抗日时期文学所起的实际作用，包括香港在内。
    首编“文艺运动”，为大后方抗战文化、文艺的指导性文献，既选了周恩来、郭沫若、茅盾的文章，也选了张治中、张道藩、王平陵的文章；既选了《抗战文艺》发刊辞等史料，也选了《文艺春秋》发刊辞等史料。只是在“书系”总体的量和质上不可能对等，这主要是由历史实况所决定。
    “理论与论争”编，选编了抗战时期大后方文艺理论建设和有关文艺问题争论的著述。值得提出的是，选辑了抗战８年中发生在大后方的６个文艺问题的争论材料，即：“文艺大众化问题”，“暴露与讽刺”问题，“与抗战无关”论，“民族形式”问题，“战国”派问题，“主观论”和“生活态度”问题，主编蔡仪写了长篇序言，对这些争论及其历史背景作了归纳和介绍。
    现实主义，贯穿整个抗日时期的大后方文学，处于无可争议的地位。文学的战斗性被提到首要位置，文学的认识功能和美学价值，交织在这一时期的作品和见诸评论。抗战文学正是从这些方面产生当时的社会效益，取得读者的赏析和承认。
    在民族敌人血腥的屠刀面前，作家与人民同命运，共患难，其生死相依的关系，从来没有抗战时期这样密切，正如小说编序言中所说：“我们要教我们今天的年轻人知道我国近代史上还有８年抗日战争的灾难，他们的老一辈人是怎样过着流离恐怖的日子，……作家中有的人亲身到前线或去敌后参加了抗日战争，有的在流亡途中尝尽了逃难的苦头，有的处在后方，也在炸弹声中惊魂动魄，不得安宁……”。诗歌编序言也回忆了当年情景：“不管江南塞北，不论男女老少，田园家室，安宁温馨，一切都在苦难、破碎之中，啊，山河无处不烽烟……”。岁月抹不掉历史的记忆，作家与人民休戚相关，产生着战斗的文学——“它为着痛苦的民众，呼出悲怒的叫号，它为着神圣的祖国，争取前途的光明！它号召着战斗，他报告着未来的希望，像一道光华的长虹，划破了世纪的晴空，像一群勇敢的海燕，冲击着时代的阴霾。”
    作家与生活的关系，在当时的大后方，尽管还受着人为的和物质的种种限制，但是战争驱使大批作家离开沿海城市，走向内地和农村，前线和敌后，开阔了生活的视野，激发了创作的活力。
    政治，这个在八十年代被宣称要疏远冷落的字眼，在抗日战争年代，却是作家很自然的朋友，作为生活的普遍内涵，进入作家的主体意识，因为抗战的成败，系着民族的生死存亡，决定人民做主人还是为奴隶的命运。作家们自觉服从“坚持抗战，反对投降，坚持团结，反对分裂，坚持进步，反对倒退”的准则，熔铸于自己的生活和艺术之中。关于这一历史和文学的客观进程，夏衍有一段很好的说明——“马克思读了《德国——一个冬天的童话》之后对作者海涅说：夜莺和百灵鸟的歌声是很美的，但今天，德国更需要有时代的诗。抗日战争时期是战争和革命的时代，当时在大后方的作家，除了郭沫若、叶圣陶、闻一多、朱自清、茅盾之外，绝大多数人都还是二三十岁的热血青年，在这种主客观条件下，希望或要求大后方文学能达到用优美的形式来表现急剧变化着的时代，要达到政治内涵和美的形式的高度结合的境界，还是难以实现的理想和责备求全的苛求。抗战时期的大后方文学是‘时代的诗’，是洋溢着爱国主义热情的文学。”（《总序》）
    正是作为“时代的诗”，大后方抗战文学发出了那个时代的巨响和沉吟，慷慨悲歌，哀怨决绝，似雷似鼓，如泣如诉，组成了一部中华民族决死求生的战斗交响乐——“日本侵略军在屠杀，中华民族在拚搏，中国人民的血在迸溅，中华大地的火在燃烧。”（《报告文学编序言》）
    我们暂且不以艺术论先后，不妨从易于直窥内涵的报告文学、诗歌和外国人士作品中随意摘出几组篇目来：——《芦沟桥畔》、《血战台儿庄》、《保卫黄河》、《血染的军旗》、《当南京被虐杀的时候》、《成都，我把你摇醒》、《夜夜梦江南》、《一九四三——蒋介石开始失去民心》、《到敌人后方去》……这难道不是——铁与火的历史、血和泪的诗篇！它牵连着全民族生死荣辱的感情，躁动着千百万死难同胞不安的灵魂，难道不应让我们的子孙后代永记不忘！这是整个抗日战争时期（包括大后方和解放区）中国文学生命力之所在，是这个文学永存于文学史册的价值之所在。
    它又是一部时代的备忘录，是日本帝国主义发动侵略战争的见证。可以作为深受这场战争之害的中国人民、日本人民的暮鼓晨钟，可以作为日本国内少数人企图篡改历史的军国主义者的黄牌警告。
    这里特别值得感谢的是外国人士写中国抗战的作品，更加具有客观的公正性和道义性。据选编者林亚光同志介绍，这一编是从２０００多万字的资料中选出的６４万字，有４０位作者的７０篇（题）作品。选编者认为：“由于作者渗透在写作中的文化意识，比照眼光和真知灼见，这些作品具有文化历史反思的价值和现实意义，至今有强大的生命力，它们对于研究者及文学创作和欣赏者，特别是对于人们探讨文学作品生命力之谜，也具有借鉴作用。”（该编《后记》）
    在全民团结旗帜下的中国抗战文学，其主题的生命力来自抗日和民主。抗日和不抗日，民主和反民主的斗争，险象环生的矛盾的尖锐性和复杂性，益增文学的悲愤感和时代价值。夏衍指出：“抗战初期，国共两党和无党派作家可以在一起开会，座谈，可以搞集体创作（如武汉时期的《国家至上》、广州时期的《黄花岗》），乃至可以同台演戏，可是１９３９年之后，要这样做就不容易了。”（《总序》）而八年抗战大后方文学的优秀之作，大多数产生于抗战的中期和后期，如艾青的《火把》、老舍的《四世同堂》、巴金的《寒夜》、郭沫若的《屈原》、茅盾的《腐蚀》、曹禺的《北京人》、夏衍的《法西斯细菌》、阳翰笙的《天国春秋》、吴祖光的《风雪夜归人》、沈从文的《长河》、张恨水的《八十梦》、沙汀和张天翼的短篇小说、马凡陀的山歌……可以列出一长串《书系》编入的或存目的当代名家的优秀之作，正是在文网森严的高压下产生的，特别是杂文的崛起和历史剧的大量涌现。戏剧选编者石曼在《后记》里提供的历史剧《天国春秋》和《屈原》演出的实况，具有现实和文学的规律性——“阳翰笙的《天国春秋》写于１９４１年９月，这时正值皖南事变之后，作者借太平天国的历史教训谴责顽固派同室操戈、破坏抗战的罪行，当年１１月１６日即由中华剧艺社在重庆国泰大戏院上演。每当剧中人洪宣娇在醒觉后深自忏悔地喊出：“大敌当前，我们不能自相残杀！”观众席中立刻爆发出雷鸣般的掌声。……我在校订中，发现１９４４年群益版的《天国春秋》，竟无前面提到的洪宣娇那段烩炙人口的台词，显然当时是为了通过检查的关系，这次已经恢复。”
    “看过《屈原》演出的人，听到《雷电颂》的每一句诗，都像在心里添了一把火，全身热血都会沸腾起来，那‘爆炸吧，毁灭吧！’的吼声……这本是郭沫若借屈原之口，喷发出自己的愤怒，当时人们到处响应着诗人对现实的愤怒，它像冲破阴霾的生命之火，传播在广袤的大后方。”
    与戏剧相比，当时大后方电影是薄弱的一环，其原因始末，张骏祥在该编序言中有所论述。难能可贵的是，由于选编者的艰苦努力，在有关方面的大力协助下，克服文字资料奇缺的困难，终于选出２１部电影成编。其中有几部是从仅存拷贝中，依据影片还原为剧本的，填补了空白，又重新获得了文字资料。他们做了很好的工作。编者们在《后记》里说：“如果在《中国抗日战争时期大后方文学书系》中电影成为空缺，我们将愧对前辈和后人。”这种心情，也是全体参加选编者的心情。通俗编的沙里淘金，诗歌编的新旧体并蓄，都是工作繁难的创举。“书系”１０００余万字，篇目盈千，除了电影编，都是从十倍几十倍资料的“普查”基础上筛选出来的，“普查”的深广度各编都有差别，但选编态度的严肃认真却是一致的。
    在纸张昂贵，出版界竞争经济效益，严肃书籍出版困难的时候，重庆出版社卓具胆识，毅然担负起这套浩大《书系》的出版重任，赢得出版界、文艺界的赞佩。《书系》编委会勉力完成编务的欣慰之余，在揭诸卷首的《编辑的话》里，写了如下一段寄托心愿的文字：“‘书系’作为一个时代的重要文学史料的初步汇成，还有待于读者的批评，有待于出版界的批评和继续完善。抗日战争时期的大后方和解放区之分，是历史的产物，犹如今天还存在大陆与台湾之分一样。文学是属于人民，属于祖国，属于时代的，但愿不久的将来，有一部分区域的统一的更完备的中国‘抗战文艺’的巨卷面世，作为一个伟大时代的苦难历史的见证，永远留给我们民族的子孙后代。”
