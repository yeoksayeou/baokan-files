Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 27th.

The important economic indicators released today by the National Bureau of Statistics, the State Planning Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and the People's Bank of China show that in the first five months of this year, the national fixed asset investment continued to decrease, the credit scale continued to expand, the total wage increase remained unabated, and industrial economic efficiency showed no significant improvement.

Fixed asset investment growth continued to decline. From January to May, the total investment completed by state-owned enterprises was 44.16 billion yuan, a decrease of 7.1% compared to the same period last year. There were 22 regions with decreases, with Hubei, Yunnan, Ningxia, and Beijing seeing declines of over 20%. Eight regions saw an increase in fixed asset investment compared to the same period last year, with Hainan seeing approximately a 100% increase and Tibet seeing a 50% increase. In terms of completed investment, Guangdong, Shanghai, Liaoning, Jiangsu, Sichuan, and Shandong remained at the forefront.

From January to May, the cumulative completed investment for local projects was 24.03 billion yuan, a decrease of 4.9% compared to the same period last year. The proportion of local projects in the total national investment completed remains high, at 54.42%. Although the investment scale was somewhat reduced in the first five months, it still falls short of the planned reduction of 28.8%.

The credit scale continued to expand. Since the beginning of this year, the total loan balance of banks nationwide has increased month by month, reaching 1065 billion yuan by the end of May, an increase of 9.8 billion yuan from the beginning of the year. Sixteen provinces and municipalities saw different degrees of increase, with Shanghai, Guangdong, and Liaoning seeing the most significant increases, accounting for 72.6% of the national loan increase. Fourteen regions saw different degrees of decrease, with Shandong, Jiangsu, and Henan seeing the most significant decreases. Currently, in the context of sustained strong social demand, credit cannot be relaxed. Banks should primarily control the credit scale and adjust the loan structure to alleviate the contradiction of social capital shortages.

The total wage increase remained unabated. From January to May, the total wage was 96.38 billion yuan, an increase of 24.6% compared to the same period last year. Seven regions saw increases above the national average, with Guangdong leading at 41.7%. Tianjin, Liaoning, Fujian, and Shandong also saw increases of over 26%.

Industrial labor productivity continued to rise slowly. From January to May, the labor productivity of state-owned industrial enterprises with independent accounting was 3.4% higher than the same period last year. Excluding Tibet, 26 out of 29 regions saw increases compared to the same period last year, with Hunan, Jiangsu, and Hubei seeing decreases.

The industrial sales tax rate continued to decline. From January to May, the sales tax rate for budgetary industrial enterprises was 17.53%, a decrease of 2.23 percentage points compared to the same period last year. Out of 29 regions, only 10 saw small increases, while 19 saw different degrees of decrease, with Tianjin seeing the largest decrease.

The cost of comparable industrial products continued to rise sharply. From January to May, the cost of comparable industrial products rose by 18%, an increase of 11.3 percentage points compared to the same period last year. All regions saw an upward trend, with 18 regions higher than the national average, and Beijing seeing the largest increase at 24.5%.

　　今年头五个月各地重要经济指标表明    
    固定资产投资减少　信贷规模继续扩大  工资总额增速不减　经济效益未见好转
    本报北京６月２７日讯  记者张国荣报道：国家统计局、国家计委、财政部和中国人民银行今天发布的各地区重要经济指标统计资料表明，今年１至５月份，全国固定资产投资继续减少，信贷规模继续扩大，工资总额增速不减，工业经济效益未见明显好转。
    固定资产投资增速继续下降。１至５月，全民所有制单位固定资产投资完成额４４１．６亿元，比去年同期下降７．１％。全国共有２２个地区下降，下降幅度在２０％以上的有湖北、云南、宁夏、北京。有８个地区的固定资产投资额比去年同期增多，其中海南增长约１倍，西藏增长５０％。从投资完成额看，广东、上海、辽宁、江苏、四川、山东等省市仍居前列。
    １至５月累计地方项目投资完成额２４０．３亿元，比去年同期下降４．９％。地方项目占全国投资完成额比重依然偏高，达５４．４２％。尽管前五个月投资规模有所压缩，但与计划压缩２８．８％的要求仍有很大距离。
    信贷规模继续扩大。今年以来，全国银行各项贷款余额逐月增加，５月末达到１０６５０亿元，比年初增加９８亿元。有１６个省市区比年初有不同程度的增加，其中上海、广东和辽宁增加最多，这三省市合计占全国贷款增加额的７２．６％。有１４个地区有不同程度的减少，其中山东、江苏、河南三省减少最多。当前，在社会总需求旺盛不衰的情况下，信贷不能松动，银行主要应在控制信贷规模的基础上，通过对贷款结构的调整来缓解社会资金紧缺的矛盾。
    工资总额增速不减。１至５月工资总额９６３．８亿元，比上年同期增长２４．６％。有７个地区增幅超过全国平均水平，广东依旧居于首位，达４１．７％。天津、辽宁、福建、山东四省市增幅也超过２６％。
    工业劳动生产率继续缓慢上升。１至５月全民所有制独立核算工业全员劳动生产率比上年同期增长３．４％。除西藏以外的２９个地区中２６个地区是比上年同期增长的，湖南、江苏和湖北３个地区比上年同期下降。
    工业销售利税率继续下降。１至５月，全民所有制预算内工业企业销售利税率为１７．５３％，比去年同期下降２．２３个百分点。２９个地区中仅有１０个地区有小幅度上升，１９个地区呈不同程度的下降，下降幅度最大的是天津市。
    工业可比产品成本仍大幅度上升。１至５月工业可比产品成本上升１８％，比上年同期多１１．３个百分点。全国各地均呈上升趋势，１８个地区高于全国平均水平，北京上升幅度最大，为２４．５％。
