In recent days, Liaoning province has shut down seven underground factories producing candy containing toxic dyes.

These underground factories used large amounts of industrial dyes containing toxins in their candy production. According to Wu Deming, director of the provincial food inspection bureau, industrial dyes are harmful to consumers and can cause genetic mutations, birth defects, and even cancer.

The seven shut-down underground factories were set up by farmers from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and other provinces without proper authorization. In their pursuit of profits, they added cheap industrial dyes to the candy and packaged it in bags resembling those used by state-owned large food enterprises, deceiving consumers.

　　在糖果中投放含毒色素
    辽宁七家地下工厂被封
    据新华社沈阳６月１９日电  （记者马义）辽宁最近查封了７家生产含毒糖果的地下工厂。
    这些地下工厂生产的糖果中，使用大量含毒素的工业色素。据省食品检验所主任吴德明介绍，工业色素不仅对食用者有害，而且还导致遗传功能突变，出现畸形，甚至致癌。
    被查封的这７家地下工厂是由来自江苏、浙江、安徽等地的农民在未经批准的情况下开办的。他们为了牟取暴利，竟在糖果中投放廉价的工业色素，然后用国营大食品企业的包装袋包装，蒙骗消费者。
