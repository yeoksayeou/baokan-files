Beijing Invites Representatives from Eight Ongoing Projects for a Discussion to Accelerate the Construction of Joint Venture Projects

    The Beijing municipal government today invited representatives from both Chinese and foreign parties involved in eight ongoing joint venture projects, as well as the heads of the construction units, to discuss and plan the construction efforts.

    Beijing's acting mayor, Zhang Baifu, assured the attendees that safety in Beijing is absolutely guaranteed. He also mentioned that officials from departments such as urban construction, planning, and public utilities were present to discuss how to speed up the construction process and make up for the time lost in previous phases.

    When Mr. Liang Baohong, the site manager from Singapore's Indeco Company for the International Trade Center, mentioned that the project needs nearly 10,000 additional workers to complete by the end of this year, the representative from the China Construction First Bureau immediately responded that the 10,000 workers would be sourced domestically. Mr. Nagai Jusuke, the Japanese director and general manager of the International News Broadcasting and Television Exchange Center, who had just arrived from Tokyo, also spoke, expressing his confidence that China's open-door policy would not change.

    The responsible official from the Beijing Municipal Commission of Economy and Trade sincerely stated that Beijing's existing foreign-funded projects will not stop executing their contracts, and the approval and construction of new projects will also continue.

    The eight ongoing joint venture projects are: International Trade Center, Beijing Overseas Chinese Building Co., Ltd., International News Broadcasting and Television Exchange Center, Beijing Development Building Co., Ltd., Jingguang Center, Hong Kong and Macau Center, Huawai Building, and Jingbo Sass Hotel.

    本报北京６月２２日讯  记者赵兴林报道：北京市政府今天邀请８个在建合资项目的中、外方人士和承建施工单位负责人座谈，共商建设大计。

    当国际贸易中心的新加坡英迪柯公司现场经理梁宝宏先生谈到国贸中心工程今年要全部竣工，还需要增加近万名工人时，承建施工的中建一局负责人当即表示：这万名工人由国内解决。刚从日本东京飞抵北京，立即赶来参加座谈的国际新闻广播电视交流中心董事、日方总经理永井寿助先生即席发言，他坚信中国政府对外开放政策不会改变。
    市经贸委负责人诚恳表示，北京已有外资项目执行合同不会停止，建设、审批新项目也不会停止。
