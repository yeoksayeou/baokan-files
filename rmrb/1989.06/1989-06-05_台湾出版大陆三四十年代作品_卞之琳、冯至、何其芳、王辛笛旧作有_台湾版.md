Taiwan Publishes Works from Mainland China's 1930s and 1940s

Works by Mainland Chinese Authors from the 1930s and 1940s Have "Taiwan Editions"

    Taiwan's cultural circles have recently introduced and published a batch of works by mainland Chinese authors, using such "foundational work" to fill the "gap" between Taiwanese and mainland modern literature.

    The well-known Da Yan Bookstore in Taiwan recently released the "Da Yan Classics Series," with the first batch including works by four renowned mainland poets. These are the works of Bian Zhilin, known as a heavyweight in the modern poetry scene, including his "Ten Years of Poetry"; the poet Feng Zhi's prose works "Mountains and Rivers"; He Qi Fang's "Dream Painting," which was praised in the 1930s as an "independent artistic creation with a profound charm"; and Shanghai poet Wang Xin Di's "Palm Collection." Over the past month, Da Yan Bookstore has held seminars for this series, with Xiang Xian lecturing on Wang Xin Di's poetry collection, Chen Yi Zhi lecturing on Bian Zhilin's poetry collection, and Wei Tian Xiang and Jiang Xun introducing Feng Zhi and He Qi Fang's prose collections, respectively. It is reported that Taiwan's concentrated introduction and publication of mainland authors' works and translations from the 1930s and 1940s is the first of its kind in nearly forty years.

　　台湾出版大陆三四十年代作品
    卞之琳、冯至、何其芳、王辛笛旧作有“台湾版”
    本报讯  台湾文化界最近接连介绍和出版了一批大陆作家的作品，以这样的“砌石搬土工作”，来填满台湾与大陆现代文学间的“断层空间”。
    在台湾颇有名望的大雁书店最近推出《大雁经典大系》，首批四位大陆名诗人的作品列入大系出版，他们是被誉为现代诗坛重镇的卞之琳的《十年诗草》，诗人冯至的散文作品《山水》、三十年代就被评为“独立的艺术制作、具有超达深渊的情趣”的何其芳的《画梦录》和上海诗人王辛笛的《手掌集》。一个月来，大雁书店还为这套大系的出版举行研讨会，由痖弦主讲辛笛诗集，陈义芝主讲卞之琳诗集，尉天?和蒋勋分别介绍冯至和何其芳的散文集。据悉，台湾集中介绍和出版大陆作家三四十年代作品和译作，是近四十年来首次。
