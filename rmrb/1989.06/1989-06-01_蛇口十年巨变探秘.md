In the early spring of the Year of the Snake, I visited Snake Mouth. At the Nanhai Hotel, I happened to see a couplet written by Mr. Yuan Geng: "Standing proudly by the Pearl River, surveying the world; Overlooking the Guangdong Sea, reflecting on a thousand years." It is grand and expresses the ambitious spirit of the pioneers of Snake Mouth. Ten years of hard work, ten years of great changes. Snake Mouth has transformed from a snake into a dragon.

---Snake Mouth was originally a small fishing village. In just ten years, it has become a modern port industrial city. In 1980-1981, Snake Mouth's industrial output value was zero; by 1988, it had reached 1.9 billion yuan, with a per capita GDP of $5,400, and the port's annual throughput was nearly 60 million tons.

---Snake Mouth, once a cultural desert, has in just ten years become a civilized new city. From kindergartens, primary schools, and middle schools to training centers, a path of talent cultivation has been created. Annual training of 4,000 people has improved the quality of Snake Mouth residents. Among the 3,600 managers and entrepreneurs, about 70% have received college education or above, showcasing the cultural charm of a young immigrant city.

Comrade Deng Xiaoping said, "Shenzhen develops fast, and Snake Mouth is even faster than Shenzhen." The former Governor of Hong Kong, Yuet, said, "The pace of change in Snake Mouth is faster than that in Hong Kong." People ask: What is the secret behind the decade of transformation in this small area with a population of just 50,000? This question can be answered from different perspectives. In my view, the secret of Snake Mouth's decade of transformation lies in the transformation of the social model, not towards a capitalist system, but breaking away from the constraints of the traditional socialist model and exploring a new socialist model.

Stalin's traditional socialist model, in short, is the use of a highly centralized government system to regulate the national economy, replacing multiple market networks and the competitive behavior of hundreds of thousands of enterprises, thus suffocating the vitality that socialism should have.

The pioneers of Snake Mouth are exploring a new socialist model. The core of this model is to provide a new combination mechanism for promoting the modernization of the national economy—a seemingly invisible force, a seemingly intangible catalyst.

Starting from its own situation, what combination mechanism have the explorers of Snake Mouth found? From my observation, it is the combination of economic, political, and cultural mechanisms. This combination releases human energy and the energy of production factors.

Economic Mechanism

Snake Mouth implements a "three-in-one" development strategy of foreign investment as the main driver, exports as the main focus, and industry as the mainstay. In terms of ownership, it breaks away from the traditional socialist product economy model and establishes a corporate economy with multiple economic components, where the state-owned economy, though not large in proportion, controls the economic lifeline of the Snake Mouth community. It clearly separates the ultimate ownership of the state-owned economy, the ultimate ownership of natural persons, and the corporate ownership of enterprises; at the same time, it implements various forms of responsibility systems within enterprises, with contracts as the bond between corporate owners and managers.

Corporate economy, whether state-owned, private, or joint ventures (domestic and foreign), all have mechanisms for property rights constraints and innovation incentives, making enterprises have self-profitable mechanisms, thereby deriving mechanisms for enterprise self-development and self-restraint, as well as mechanisms for participating in market competition.

From the perspective of Snake Mouth, the leading role of the state-owned economy and the catalytic role of foreign capital are the keys to forming a corporate economy. The basic characteristic of the corporate economy is to exclude the government functions of blending politics and business, officialdom and commerce, and to accept the government's macro-regulation and legal supervision equally. The corporate economy, combined with the reform of the enterprise distribution system, adheres to the principle of more pay for more work and a fair and reasonable redistribution system; reforms the personnel and labor system, promotes a two-way selection of personnel mobility; implements the commercialization of housing, with the principle of equality before commodities; implements the social labor insurance system, making everyone feel secure, and so on. This forms an economic mechanism that releases human energy and the energy of production factors. This is the economic secret of Snake Mouth's decade of transformation.

Political Mechanism

The 13th Party Congress proposed: "We will ultimately catch up with developed capitalist countries in economics, create a higher and more practical democracy in politics, and cultivate more and better talents than these countries. We will use these requirements to examine the effectiveness of the reform." This major task of political reform has been seriously explored and experimented with in the Snake Mouth Industrial Zone.

The political reform in the Snake Mouth Industrial Zone is carried out under the leadership of the Party, focusing on building a socialist democratic system and opposing privileges and "officialdom." They have carried out the following reforms: First, they have weakened privileges and "officialdom" and were the first in the country to cancel the preferential regulations for officials going abroad; in the personnel system, they have frozen the original administrative ranks. Second, in the distribution system, they have canceled privileges, and wages are determined according to ability and position, decoupled from the original administrative ranks. Third, they adhere to the principle that power must be constrained, and the decision-making of the leadership is subject to public supervision. The public has the right to know, and the leadership has transparency. Fourth, for high-level leaders holding social management positions, they implement open differential elections and votes of confidence. Fifth, they implement the system of public opinion supervision and implement the constitutional provisions of freedom of speech for the people. Sixth, they implement the constitutional provisions of freedom of association for the people and have legally established 26 civilian organizations, which are a force for political participation. Seventh, the "Snake Mouth Newsletter" has become a forum for the people of Snake Mouth, implementing the system of editorial responsibility. Often, articles criticizing Snake Mouth leaders are published in the newspaper. Eighth, the "Snake Mouth Salon" is a place for the people of Snake Mouth to exchange ideas with the leadership and a platform for discussing major events in Snake Mouth.

The political reform in Snake Mouth has created a lively political atmosphere. The people enjoy the freedom guaranteed by the constitution. This political mechanism has become a catalyst for releasing the energy of the people. This is the political secret of Snake Mouth's decade of transformation.

Cultural Mechanism

The core role of the cultural mechanism in Snake Mouth is to guide the updating of people's ideas, and traditional cultural concepts are subject to new tests. In the collision between traditional national culture and overseas culture, the people of Snake Mouth have carried out a new selection of cultural concepts, promoting the new development of Marxist cultural thought.

---Socialist democratic consciousness is growing, and feudal hierarchical concepts are fading;
---The consciousness of self-choice is growing, and the psychology of personal dependence is fading;
---The consciousness of equal competition is growing, and the concept of privileges is fading;
---The concept of contractual credit is strengthening, and the habit of using power to replace law is being criticized;
---The concept of time and progress is strengthening, and the psychology of being content is fading;
---The value of knowledge is increasing, and the concept of respecting knowledge is strengthening, and the social atmosphere of self-study and self-improvement is strengthening;
---The sense of social responsibility of citizens is strengthening, and the attitude of only taking and not giving is being criticized, and so on.

The cultural mechanism is like a catalyst. It helps to turn lazy people into diligent people, stupid people into smart people, and backward people into progressive people. The cultural mechanism is a subtle mechanism that helps to turn people into civilized people. This is the cultural secret of Snake Mouth's decade of transformation.

The new mechanism replaces the old mechanism, which is the product of reform and opening up. Therefore, ultimately, the decade of transformation in Snake Mouth is due to reform and opening up.

While praising the decade of transformation in Snake Mouth, people often raise various questions:

---Will Snake Mouth's high investment growth, with an annual increase of 28.32% from 1984 to 1988, disrupt the national balance of supply and demand and lead to demand inflation? I don't think so. From the source of funds, in 1984, the actual cumulative investment was 1.467 billion Hong Kong dollars, and in 1988, it was 3.977 billion Hong Kong dollars, mainly from foreign and overseas investments, not domestic investments. In 1988, Snake Mouth remitted 242.12 million yuan in customs duties and surcharges to the state. In terms of finance and foreign exchange, Snake Mouth has formed a small "macro" adjustment mechanism of self-balancing, with a surplus every year. For credit, Shenzhen implements a tiered management system, and the state's "big cage" and Shenzhen's "small cage" have been separated, while Snake Mouth's credit receipts and payments are subject to Shenzhen's "small cage" and will not disrupt the national macro balance.

---Will Snake Mouth's high economic growth, with an average annual increase of 36.31% in total industrial output from 1984 to 1988, affect the inland areas? I don't think so. Snake Mouth mainly develops industry and maritime transport. Snake Mouth's electricity is supplied from overseas; transportation facilities are invested in advance, and the port provides the country with a large amount of transshipment capacity; most of the raw materials are imported, using some inland non-scarce resources, and the products are also mostly exported. In 1988, exports accounted for 66.2% of the total industrial output, and the average annual increase in exports over the past four years was 39.32%. Through imports and exports, the supply and demand relationship in the domestic market is also adjusted. Snake Mouth's own grain is also mostly imported with its own foreign exchange. Therefore, there are fewer criticisms of Snake Mouth from the inland areas.

Snake Mouth is, after all, not a crystal-clear crystal ball, but a small society on earth, with various social contradictions and spots. What is gratifying is that Snake Mouth is continuing to move forward. The contradictions in the process of advancement will be resolved in the reform.

　　蛇口十年巨变探秘
    王琢
    蛇年早春访蛇口。在南海酒店，偶尔看到袁庚先生所撰楹联：“雄踞珠江纵观天下，胜览粤海秉鉴千秋。”它气势磅礴，抒发了蛇口开拓者们的壮志豪情。十年耕耘，十年巨变。蛇口已从一条蛇变成一条龙。
    ——蛇口原是个小渔村，短短十年，变成一座现代港口工业城市。１９８０—１９８１年，蛇口工业产值是个零数；１９８８年已达１９亿元，人均国内生产总值为５４００美元，港口年吞吐量已近６００万吨。
    ——世代文化沙漠的蛇口，短短十年，却变成一座文明新城。从幼儿园、小学、中学到培训中心，开创了一条育才之路。每年４０００人次的培训，提高着蛇口人的素质。３６００名经营者、管理者中，受过大专以上教育的约占７０％，显示了青年移民城市的文化风采。
    小平同志说：“深圳发展快，蛇口比深圳还快”。香港前总督尤德说：“蛇口变化的节奏比香港还快”。人们要问：弹丸之地、五万之众的蛇口，十年巨变的奥秘是什么？这样的问题，可从不同视角，作出种种回答。依我看来，蛇口十年巨变的奥秘，从社会原因分析，就在于社会模式的转型，不是转到资本主义制度那边去，而是突破了传统社会主义模式的束缚，对新的社会主义模式进行的探索。
    斯大林的传统社会主义模式，简而言之，就是用一个高度集中的中央政府体系调节全国经济的运行，取代了多种市场网络和几十万个企业的竞争行为，因此，窒息了社会主义经济应有的生机与活力。
    蛇口的开拓者正在探索一种新的社会主义模式。这种模式的核心是为推动国民经济现代化提供一种新的组合机制——一种似乎看不见的力量，一种似乎摸不到的催化剂。
    蛇口的探索者从自身的情况出发，找到了什么组合机制？据我的观察，就是经济机制、政治机制和文化机制的组合，这种组合释放了人的能量，也释放了生产要素的能量。
    　　　　经济机制
    蛇口实行外资为主、出口为主、工业为主的“三连环”发展战略，从所有制上突破了传统社会主义产品经济模式，建立了国有经济比重不大却掌握蛇口社区经济命脉的多种经济成份的法人经济。它使国有经济的最终产权、自然人的最终产权同企业法人产权明确分开；同时在企业内部企业法人与经营者之间实行多种形式的以合同为纽带的负责制。
    法人经济，不论国有制法人经济、私有制法人经济，还是公私（内资与外资）合营的法人经济，都有产权约束和创新激励的机制，使企业具有自负盈亏的机制，由此派生出企业自我发展与自我约束机制，以及参与市场竞争的机制。
    从蛇口来看，国有经济的主导作用和国外资本的酵母作用是形成法人经济的关键。法人经济的基本特征是排斥政企不分、官商不分的政府职能，而接受政府一视同仁的宏观调节与法律监督。法人经济加上企业分配制度的改革，坚持多劳多得的原则和公平合理的再分配制度；改革人事劳动制度，推行双向选择的人员流动制度；实行住宅商品化，在商品面前人人平等的原则；推行社会劳动保险制度，使人人都有安全感，等等。这就形成释放人的能量，释放生产要素能量的经济机制。这是蛇口十年巨变经济上的奥秘。
    　　　　政治机制
    党的十三大提出：“我们最终要在经济上赶上发达的资本主义国家，在政治上创造比这些国家更高更切实的民主，并且造就比这些国家更多更优秀的人才。要用这些要求来检验改革的成效。”政治改革这件大事，在蛇口工业区认真进行了探索与试验。
    蛇口工业区的政治改革，是在党的领导下围绕建设社会主义民主制度，反对特权现象和“官本位”展开的。他们先后进行这样一些改革：一、淡化特权和“官本位”，在全国率先取消干部出国的优惠规定；在人事制度上，冻结了原有行政级别。二、在分配制度上取消特权，工资根据能力、岗位确定，而同原有行政级别脱钩。三、坚持权力要受制约的原则，领导层的决策受群众监督。群众有知情权，领导层有透明度。四、对担任社会管理职务的高层领导人员，实行公开的差额选举和信任投票。五、实行舆论监督制度，落实宪法规定的人民言论自由。六、实行宪法规定的人民结社自由，依法先后成立２６个民间社团，是议政参政的一支力量。七、《蛇口通讯报》成为蛇口人的论坛，实行总编辑负责制。在报上经常刊出批评蛇口领导成员的文稿。八、蛇口“沙龙”，是蛇口群众与领导层人员交流思想的场所，也是议论蛇口大事的讲坛。
    蛇口的政治改革产生了一个生动活泼的政治局面。人民享有宪法保障的自由。这种政治机制成为释放人民能量的催化剂。这是蛇口十年巨变政治上的奥秘。
    　　　　文化机制
    蛇口文化机制的核心作用，是引导人民观念的更新，民族传统文化观念受到新的检验。在民族传统文化与海外文化的撞击中，蛇口人进行了文化观念的新筛选，推动了马克思主义文化思想的新发展。
    ——社会主义民主意识在增长，封建主义等级观念在淡化；
    ——自主选择意识在增长，人身依附心理在淡化；
    ——平等竞争意识在增长，特权观念在淡化；
    ——契约信用观念在增强，以权代法的积习受到非议；
    ——时间观念和进取观念在增强，“知足”心理在淡化；
    ——知识价值在升值，尊重知识的观念在增强，自觉学习、自求上进的社会风气在加强。
    ——公民的社会责任感在增强，只顾索取、不讲奉献的态度受到非议，等等。
    文化机制犹如一种催化剂。它有助于把懒惰的人变为勤劳的人，把愚蠢的人变为聪明的人，把落后的人变为进步的人。文化机制是一种潜移默化的机制，它有助于把人变为文明的人。这是蛇口十年巨变在文化上的奥秘。
    新的机制代替旧的机制是改革开放的产物。所以，归根到底，蛇口十年巨变得力于改革开放。
    人们在赞誉蛇口十年巨变的同时，往往也会提出这样那样的疑问：
    ——蛇口投入的高增长，１９８４—１９８８年的四年内投资每年递增２８．３２％，这会不会冲击国家总量平衡，导致需求膨胀？我看不会。从资金来源看，１９８４年实际投资累计为１４．６７亿港元，１９８８年实际投资累计为３９．７７亿港元，主要是国外、境外投资，而不是国内投资。蛇口１９８８年向国家上交关税和代征税２４２１２万元。财政与外汇，蛇口已形成自求平衡的小“宏观”调节机制，每年都有点结余。对于信贷，深圳市实行切块分层管理体制，国家的“大笼子”与深圳市的“小笼子”已经分开，而蛇口的信贷收支则受制于深圳市的“小笼子”，不会冲击国家宏观总量平衡。
    ——蛇口经济的高增长，１９８４—１９８８年的四年内，工业总产值每年平均递增３６．３１％，会不会牵动内地？我看也不会。蛇口主要发展工业和海运业。蛇口的电力靠境外供给；交通设施超前投资，海港为国家提供大量中转能力；大部分原料靠进口，用一部分内地不稀缺的资源，产品也都大部分出口。１９８８年工业总产值中出口占６６．２％，近四年内出口每年平均递增３９．３２％。通过进出口也调节了国内市场的供需关系。蛇口自用粮食也大部分用自有外汇进口。所以，内地对蛇口非议较少。
    蛇口，毕竟不是一颗晶莹明亮的水晶球，只是一个人间的小社会，总有种种社会矛盾，总有斑斑点点。令人高兴的是：蛇口在继续前进。前进中的矛盾必将在改革中得到解决。
