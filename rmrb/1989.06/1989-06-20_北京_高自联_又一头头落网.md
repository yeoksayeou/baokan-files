	At 7 PM on June 19th, an active member of the public security patrol in Renmin Park, Baoding City, discovered a suspicious individual and immediately took him to the police station for questioning. The individual identified himself as Zhang Shun, a loader. The officers noticed that his skin was relatively fair, which did not match his profession, and conducted further questioning.

In March 1978, he was admitted to the University of Science and Technology of China, graduated in 1982, and was assigned to the 601st Institute in Shenyang. In July 1984, he was admitted to the Physics Department of Peking University as a graduate student.

He is currently unemployed.

	After contacting the Beijing Public Security Bureau, the Baoding Public Security Bureau escorted Liu Gang to Beijing this morning.
