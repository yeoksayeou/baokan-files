Soviet Girls Enthralled by Professional Tennis

The current world No. 8 female tennis player, Soviet athlete Nataliya Zvereva, recently signed a contract with the American ProServ company, which will act as her agent, handling her competition and advertising contracts.

Zvereva and another Soviet female player, Larisa Savchenko, have decided to become professional players of the International Tennis Federation. Since January 1, 1989, Zvereva has earned a total of $442,780 from tennis. In 1988, Zvereva earned $403,000 in prize money, of which a portion was handed over to the Soviet State Sports Committee, leaving her with approximately $80,000.

After signing the contract, Zvereva said she had carefully considered this decision and hoped that by taking this step, she could address the issue of athletes' earnings when playing abroad.

On April 16, Zvereva turned 18. On her birthday, she and Larisa Savchenko won the doubles championship at the Amelia Island tournament.

　　苏联姑娘着迷职业网球
    现排在世界女子网球第８位的苏联选手娜塔妮娅·兹韦列娃最近与美国普鲁斯布公司签约，该公司将作为她的代理人，负责她的比赛和广告合同等事宜。
    兹韦列娃和另外一位苏联女选手拉里萨·萨夫琴科决心成为国际网球联合会的职业选手。从１９８９年１月１日以来，兹韦列娃已经从网球运动中赢得总数为４４２７８０美元的收入。而１９８８年全年兹韦列娃共获４０３０００美元奖金，除部分上缴苏联国家体委外，本人收入为８万美元左右。
    合同签订后，兹韦列娃说她是经过深思熟虑后才做出这一决定的，并希望通过采取这一步骤，能对实际存在的运动员到国外打球的报酬问题有所改变。
    ４月１６日，兹韦列娃刚满１８岁。在生日的这一天，她在阿梅里亚—艾兰德参加的决赛中，和拉里萨·萨夫琴科合作夺得了双打冠军。
