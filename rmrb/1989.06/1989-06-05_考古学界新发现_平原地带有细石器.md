The People's Daily reports: According to the results of the first phase of drilling and excavation at the Zhaibai site group in the city of Jinan, Shandong Province, which concluded at the end of May, the long-held belief in the archaeological community that fine stone tools could not exist in plain regions has been refuted.

The Zhaibai site was first excavated in early May this year by a team led by Hu Binghua, Deputy Chief Engineer of the Institute of Archaeology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Zhaibai Village, Yanzhuang Township, Wenshang County, Jinan. After more than 20 days of intensive drilling, it was preliminarily determined that the site forms a group of sites covering an area of more than 10 square kilometers. Among these, the Zhaibai site itself stretches 500 meters east to west and 100 meters north to south, covering a total area of over 50,000 square meters. So far, nine house foundations dating back approximately 7,000 years and belonging to the "Beixin Culture" type have been discovered, along with seven ash pits. Over 50 typical Beixin Culture pottery pieces and a large number of pottery shards have been unearthed, as well as more than 20 stone and bone tools. Additionally, large grinding stone disks and bone needles measuring 4 to 3 centimeters have been found.

According to Hu Binghua and other scholars and experts, these are the first such artifacts to be discovered in Shandong Province. They also found plant leaves, stems, seeds, grains, and red-burned soil blocks with mat impressions, as well as a large number of fish, turtle, snail, and shell animal remains, all of which hold significant research value.

Of particular note is the collection of over 200 fine stone tools dating back more than 10,000 years. This is the first time such artifacts have been found in a plain region in China. This major discovery provides scientific evidence for the study of prehistoric cultures and refutes the archaeological community's belief that fine stone tools could not exist in plain regions. Currently, more than 20 sites contemporaneous with the Zhaibai site have been discovered near Zhaibai, and excavation and collection work is still ongoing.

　　考古学界新发现
    平原地带有细石器
    本报讯  据５月底结束的对山东省济宁市境内的槚柏等遗址群第一期挖掘钻探结果表明：国内考古学界认为平原地带不可能有细石器的观点被否决。
    槚柏遗址是今年５月初，由中科院考古研究所副总技师胡秉华先生带队，在济宁市汶上县苑庄乡槚柏村南开始挖掘的。经过２０多天的紧张钻探，已初步探明遗址周围形成遗址群，方圆１０余平方公里。其中，槚柏一处遗址范围东西长５００米，南北宽１００米，总面积５万余平方米。现已发现距今约７０００年前的“北辛文化”类型的房基９座，灰坑７个，出土“北辛文化”典型陶器５０余件，陶片一大宗，石器、骨器２０余件；还有大型磨棒石盘，还有４至３厘米的磨制骨针。
    据胡秉华副总技师和学者、专家考证，这些都是目前山东省境内首次发现的文物珍品。并有植物的叶、茎、种子、谷物和伴有席纹痕迹的红烧土块，及大量鱼、龟、螺、蚌生物遗骨遗片，具有十分重要的资料价值。
    值得重视的是，采集到的２００余片距今一万年以上的细石器，这在国内平原地带尚属首次。这一重大发现，为研究史前文化提供了科学依据，并对否定考古学界认为平原地带不可能有细器的观点，提供了可靠的依据。目前，槚柏附近，已发现２０余处与槚柏遗址同时代的遗址群，挖掘、收集工作仍在进行。
