Nearly 100 experts and professors from Beijing, Nanjing, and other places have raised 300,000 yuan to develop the coastal tidal lands in Nantong, Jiangsu. The Nantong Purple Seaweed Joint Aquaculture Farm, which they helped invest in, began operations this spring and by the end of May had produced and processed 18 tons of purple seaweed, earning 170,000 US dollars in foreign exchange for the country.

In the early stages of building the Nantong Purple Seaweed Aquaculture Farm, attracting social idle funds was difficult due to the long investment cycle and slow returns of tidal land development. Experts from Beijing and Nanjing, who had scientific and technological cooperation with Nantong, took the initiative to contribute their long-term savings to support the tidal land development. An old professor from Nanjing Agricultural University even sold his property in his hometown for this purpose.

　　近百专家筹资
    开发南通海涂
    本报讯  北京、南京等地近百名专家、教授、研究员集资３０万元开发江苏南通海涂。由他们参与投资兴办的南通紫菜联合养殖场，于今年初春正式投产，截至５月底，已生产加工紫菜１８吨，为国家创汇１７万美元。
    南通紫菜养殖场筹建初期，由于海涂投资周期长、见效慢，吸引社会闲散资金困难。北京、南京一些与南通有科技协作关系的专家便主动拿出多年的积蓄，支持海涂开发事业。南京农业大学一位老教授为此卖掉了留在故乡的房产。
