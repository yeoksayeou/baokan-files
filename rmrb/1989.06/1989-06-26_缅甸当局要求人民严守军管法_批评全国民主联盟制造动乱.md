Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, June 26th.

Myanmar authorities are demanding that the people strictly adhere to martial law. They have criticized the National League for Democracy for causing unrest.

The official newspaper of Myanmar today once again published the 1988 No. 2 Order and No. 8 Statement issued by the State Law and Order Restoration Council last year. It urged the people to strictly abide by the government's orders regarding the implementation of martial law.

The order and statement were issued in September last year after the military took over the government by the State Law and Order Restoration Council. The main contents are to prohibit demonstrations, assemblies, anti-military incitement, unrest, and other illegal activities.

Since last night, the military has been patrolling the streets of Yangon and other towns, broadcasting the above martial law orders through loudspeakers. The broadcast said: "The martial law order is still in effect, and the country is still under martial law."

The authorities also distributed a report on the 45th press conference held by the State Law and Order Restoration Council on June 22. The report criticized Aung San Suu Kyi, the General Secretary of the National League for Democracy, and claimed that the league was causing unrest, opposing the law, and inciting the people to defy the government.

The authorities also said that there were signs that the league's strategy was similar to that of the Communist Party of Burma.

Aung San Suu Kyi defended herself at today's press conference, saying that she had never made any statements that would cause divisions within the armed forces. She emphasized that she does not believe in communism.

She once again urged the authorities to engage in dialogue with her party and other political parties to solve the problems facing Myanmar.

　　缅甸当局要求人民严守军管法    
    批评全国民主联盟制造动乱
    新华社仰光６月２６日电  缅甸的官方报纸今天再次刊登恢复法律和秩序委员会去年发布的１９８８年２号命令和８号声明，并且敦促人民严格遵守政府有关实行军事管制的法令。
    该项命令及声明是去年９月军方接管政权后由国家恢复法律和秩序委员会发布的，主要内容是禁止示威、集会、反军鼓动言论、动乱及其他违法行为。
    从昨晚起，军方一直在仰光和其他城镇的街道上巡逻，并用高音喇叭广播上述军事管制的命令。广播说：“军事管制令仍然有效，目前仍处于军事管制阶段。”　　当局今天还散发了关于恢复法律和秩序委员会６月２２日举行第４５次新闻发布会的报道。报道批评全国民主联盟总书记昂山素季，并声称发现该联盟制造动乱，反对法律并唆使人民藐视政府。
    当局还说，有迹象表明该联盟的策略与缅甸共产党的策略相同。
    昂山素季在今天举行的新闻发布会上申辩说，她从未有过使武装部队产生分裂的言论，并强调说，她决不信仰共产主义。
    她再次敦促当局为解决缅甸面临的问题而与她领导的党及其他政党对话。
