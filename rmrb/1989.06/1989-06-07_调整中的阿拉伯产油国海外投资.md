The two major oil price hikes in the 1970s left Arab oil-producing countries with substantial petrodollars. Apart from using these funds for large-scale industrialization at home, a significant portion was invested overseas. After 1982, to cover fiscal deficits, Arab oil-producing countries began withdrawing funds from overseas, leading to a continuous decline in their overseas investment. However, in the past two years, with effective measures to prevent a sharp reduction in overseas capital and a slight recovery in oil export revenues, the total overseas investment of Arab oil-producing countries has stabilized.

Scale and Distribution
According to statistics from the Arab financial sector, the current total overseas investments of Arab countries (including bank deposits, various securities, real estate, direct investments, and loans) amount to approximately $350 billion. The majority of these investments belong to the Gulf oil-producing countries, particularly Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates. These overseas investments are primarily distributed in Western developed countries, with the United States and the United Kingdom together accounting for about 30% (the United States slightly more), excluding the United Kingdom, European Community countries account for 20%, other Western developed countries account for 17%, and international organizations such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank account for 8%. Together, these account for approximately 75%; the remaining 25% is dispersed among other overseas financial centers and developing countries and regions.

Main Investment Forms
1. Bank Deposits and Short-Term Securities. For a long time, bank deposits and short-term bonds from Western countries have been one of the main forms of overseas investment for Arab oil-producing countries, at times accounting for more than two-thirds of their total overseas assets. In the 1980s, with the diversification of investments, the proportion of bank deposits and government short-term bonds in the overseas investments of Arab oil-producing countries has continuously decreased, but it is estimated that they still account for about 40% of their total overseas investments.
2. Medium and Long-Term Securities Investments. This is another major form of overseas investment for Arab oil-producing countries. Arab oil-producing countries generally have various investment companies overseas, which widely purchase medium and long-term securities with good credit ratings issued or guaranteed by foreign governments; purchase medium and long-term securities issued or guaranteed by official institutions (such as the World Bank) or institutions related to the government (such as the European Investment Bank); participate in the trading of major stock exchanges in the West, obtaining different proportions of equity in various industries.
3. Official Aid. Since the mid-1970s, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and the United Arab Emirates alone have provided more than $50 billion in official aid to developing countries, with nearly half of this amount going to non-Arab Asian and African countries. China is also among the beneficiary countries.
4. Direct Investments. Arab oil-producing countries are cautious in their overseas direct investments, aiming for "risk avoidance and preservation." Due to their lack of advanced technology and management experience, the amount of direct investments is relatively small. Compared to direct investments, bank deposits have lower risks and can be withdrawn at any time, while various securities investments are easier to manage and can generate dividends. Therefore, Arab oil-producing countries' overseas investments mainly take the form of bank deposits and indirect investments. Additionally, Arab oil-producing countries have a significant amount of funds invested in important international institutions (such as the International Monetary Fund) in the form of donations, and they also own a certain amount of real estate overseas.

Trends and Characteristics
In recent years, the weakness of the U.S. dollar, financial market fluctuations, and especially the 1987 stock market crash in the West have caused significant losses to the overseas investments of Arab oil-producing countries. Under these circumstances, the overseas investments of Arab oil-producing countries have shown some new trends:

1. Increased Interest in the East. The active economic situation in the Asia-Pacific region has long attracted the attention of Arab investors. After 1986, Kuwait began to systematically transfer part of its overseas investments to the Asia-Pacific region, particularly to Japan, Singapore, Malaysia, and South Korea. Meanwhile, Arab oil-producing countries are closely monitoring the economic reforms in China, the Soviet Union, and Eastern Europe, showing interest in finding ideal investment locations in socialist countries. At the beginning of this year, the general manager of the Kuwait Investment Company, which has hundreds of billions of dollars in overseas assets, Rashid, stated, "Eastern Europe and China are becoming places for Kuwait to consider investing."

2. The ceasefire in the Iran-Iraq war has stimulated the return of Arab overseas investments to the Arab world, especially the Gulf region. At the same time, the Arab financial sector is actively working to establish an Arab financial market, creating a suitable environment for the return of Arab capital.

3. The investment activities of Gulf oil-producing countries, especially Kuwait, in the competitive financial markets of the United States, Europe, and Japan, are increasingly recognized as mature. During the 1987 stock market crash in the West, various oil-producing countries took the opportunity to purchase a large number of shares in major oil companies and gas stations in the United States and Europe, with Kuwait making significant profits in the purchase of shares in British Petroleum.

4. There is a growing call for the Arabization of the management of Arab overseas assets. The proportion of Arab overseas investments managed through Arab banks or by Arab banks has always been very small. Today, as investment activities become increasingly mature, "how to enhance the role of Arab banks in the management of Arab overseas assets" has been placed on the agenda of the Arab financial sector. The Arabization of the management of Arab overseas assets will effectively promote the return of Arab capital.

5. Official development aid is gradually shrinking. After 1982, due to the sharp decline in oil revenues, official financial aid from Arab oil-producing countries has gradually decreased. According to statistics from the Development Assistance Committee of the Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development, official development aid from Arab countries (mainly oil-producing countries) decreased from $5.78 billion in 1982 to $3.29 billion in 1987.

Currently, the possibility of China utilizing a large amount of funds from Arab oil-producing countries is not high, but it should be noted that in recent years, the willingness of Arab oil-producing countries to disperse their overseas investments to developing countries and regions with strong economic development momentum has indeed increased; China's investment environment is continuously improving and is recognized as one of the most promising yet underdeveloped countries in the world; China's political and economic influence in the Arab world is continuously expanding. Therefore, seizing the opportunity and taking effective measures to gradually introduce a portion of the funds from Arab oil-producing countries is entirely possible.

　　调整中的阿拉伯产油国海外投资
    李绍先
    七十年代石油两次大幅度提价，阿拉伯产油国手中积聚了巨额石油美元。这些石油美元除用于国内大规模的工业化建设外，很大一部分被投放国外。１９８２年后，阿拉伯产油各国为弥补财政赤字，纷纷从海外抽回资金，其海外投资额出现连年下降趋势。但近两年，由于各国采取有力措施防止海外资本骤减，同时石油出口收入也有所回升，阿拉伯产油国海外投资总额已基本趋于稳定。
    规模和分布　据阿拉伯金融界的统计，当前阿拉伯拥有的各类海外投资（包括银行存款、各种有价证券、不动产、直接投资、贷款等）总额在３５００亿美元左右，其中绝大部分属于阿拉伯海湾产油国，特别是沙特、科威特和阿联酋三国。这些海外投资主要分布在西方发达国家，其中美国和英国共占约３０％（美国略多一点），除英国外欧共体国家占２０％，其它西方发达国家占１７％，国际货币基金组织和世界银行等国际机构占８％，以上共占约７５％；其余２５％分散在海外其它金融中心和发展中国家、地区。
    主要投资形式　（１）银行存款和短期有价证券。长期以来银行存款和西方国家短期债券一直是阿拉伯产油国海外投资的主要形式之一，比例最高时占其海外资产总额的２／３以上。进入８０年代，随着投资多样化，银行存款及政府短期债券在阿拉伯产油国海外投资中的比重不断下降，但估计目前仍占其海外投资总额的４０％左右。（２）各种中长期证券投资。这是阿拉伯产油国海外投资的又一种主要形式。阿拉伯产油国政府普遍在国外设有各类投资公司，它们广泛收购信誉较好的、由外国政府发行或保证的中长期有价证券；购买由官方机构（如世界银行）或与政府有关的机构（如欧洲投资银行）所发行或保证的中长期证券；参与西方各大股票交易所的交易，在各行业中取得不同比例的股权。（３）官方援助。七十年代中期以来，仅沙特、科威特和阿联酋三国向发展中国家提供的官方援助累计已超过５００亿美元，其中近一半提供给了非阿拉伯的亚非国家，中国也在受惠国之列。（４）直接投资。阿拉伯产油国在海外投资上注重“避险保值”，同时由于它们缺乏先进技术和管理经验，因此在直接投资方面一向谨小慎微，投资数量也很小。与直接投资相比，银行存款风险较小并可随时抽回，各种证券投资也较易于把握，坐收红利，故阿拉伯产油国海外投资多采用银行存款和间接投资等形式。此外阿拉伯产油国有一笔数目可观的资金以捐助等形式投放在一些重要国际机构（如国际货币基金组织等），在国外还拥有一定数量的房地产。
    动向、特点　近年来美元疲软，金融市场动荡，特别是１９８７年１０月西方股市暴跌，使阿拉伯产油国海外投资蒙受较大损失。在此情况下，阿拉伯产油国海外投资出现了一些新的动向：
    ⒈东来意向增强。亚太地区活跃的经济形势早已引起阿拉伯投资者的注意。１９８６年后科威特开始有计划地将其一部分海外投资向亚太地区，特别是日本、新加坡、马来西亚、南朝鲜等地转移。同时阿拉伯产油国还密切注视中、苏及东欧国家的经济改革，表现出在社会主义国家寻找理想投资场所的兴趣。今年初，拥有数百亿美元海外资产的科威特投资公司总经理拉希德表示，“东欧和中国正在成为科威特考虑进行投资的场所。”
    ⒉两伊停火重建给阿拉伯海外投资回流阿拉伯世界，特别是海湾地区以新的刺激。同时阿拉伯金融界也在积极活动，努力建立阿拉伯金融市场，为阿资回流创造适宜的环境。
    ⒊海湾产油国，特别是科威特近年在强手林立的美、欧、日金融市场上的投资活动被公认为日趋成熟。１９８７年１０月西方股市暴跌时各产油国趁机大量收购美、欧大石油公司的股权和加油站，特别是科威特在收购英国石油公司股权中，获利颇丰。
    ⒋阿拉伯海外资产管理阿拉伯化的呼声日高。通过阿拉伯银行渠道或由阿银行管理的阿拉伯海外投资在其海外投资总额中所占比重一向很小。在投资活动日益走向成熟的今天，“如何增强阿拉伯银行在阿海外资产管理中的作用”已经提上阿拉伯金融界的议事日程。阿拉伯海外资产管理阿拉伯化将有效地促进阿资的回流。
    ⒌官方开发援助日渐萎缩。１９８２年后由于石油收入骤减，阿拉伯产油国官方援助金融日渐萎缩。据经合组织的发展援助委员会的统计，阿拉伯国家（主要是产油国）的官方开发援助由１９８２年的５７．８亿美元下降到１９８７年的３２．９亿美元。
    目前我国大量利用阿产油国资金的可能性不大，但也应看到，近年来阿产油国向经济发展势头较好的发展中国家和地区分散海外投资的意愿确实在加强；我国投资环境不断改善，是公认的世界最有前途的尚待开发国家之一；我国在阿拉伯世界的政治、经济影响在不断扩大等。所以，看准时机，采取得力措施逐步引进一部分阿拉伯产油国资金还是完全可能的。
