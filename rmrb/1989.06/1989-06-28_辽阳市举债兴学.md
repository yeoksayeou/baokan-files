Liaoyang City Borrows to Build Schools

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shenyang, June 28 (Correspondent Chen Dian Sheng): To solve the problem of dilapidated and insufficient school buildings in primary and secondary schools, Liaoyang City, despite the lack of funds from the fiscal budget, decided to borrow money for educational development, securing a loan of 10 million yuan for education.

Last year, eight primary and secondary schools in the urban area of Liaoyang City needed to be rebuilt, with a funding shortage of 10 million yuan. The mayor thought, "Developing the economy can involve borrowing, and developing education is a long-term plan. Why can't we borrow for it?" After discussion at the mayor's office, it was decided to borrow 10 million yuan at an interest rate of 9.5% from the city's insurance company and labor service company to rebuild school buildings.

　　辽阳市举债兴学
    据新华社沈阳六月二十八日电（通讯员陈殿升）辽阳市为解决中小学校舍破旧短缺问题，在财政拨不出款的情况下，毅然举债兴学，贷款一千万元办教育。
    去年，辽阳市市区有八所中小学校舍需要翻建，缺少经费一千万元。市长想，发展经济可以贷款，发展教育是百年大计，为什么不能贷款？经市长办公会研究确定，以九厘五的利息从市保险公司、劳动服务公司贷款一千万元，给学校翻建校舍。
