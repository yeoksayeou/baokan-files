In recent days, in some alleys in western Beijing, officers and soldiers of a certain martial law unit have enthusiastically done good deeds for the people and brought warmth. The people praised them for bringing the spirit of Lei Feng into the capital.

In the Shijingshan and Mentougou districts, reporters saw martial law troops clearing garbage and weeds under the scorching sun, repairing roads, and assisting the elderly and children at stations and public places to maintain order. The military and civilians are as close as one family. The environment of Sanjia Shop Street was poor, and more than 100 soldiers came here multiple times to clean, making the streets look new. The medical staff of the unit went deep into the residential areas for medical examinations and sprayed disinfectant in some streets and garbage points. Near the barracks, an elderly retired worker in his seventies has no children and finds it difficult to take care of himself. The officers and soldiers, upon learning this, voluntarily helped him buy rice, move coal, and do odd jobs, making the old man feel warm at heart.

Since taking on the martial law mission, this unit has emphasized turning Lei Feng's spirit of wholeheartedly serving the people into the practical actions of the broad masses of officers and soldiers. Officers and soldiers have organized more than a hundred Lei Feng learning groups. They said, "While we are carrying out the martial law mission as ordered, we need to carry forward the spirit of Lei Feng even more, to win the love and trust of the people." When the unit advanced, Squad Leader Li Zhan Sheng saw a girl fall to the ground in the crowd and rushed to rescue her without hesitation. The girl was saved, but he was trampled by the crowd and is still in the hospital with unhealed injuries. Section Chief Dong Yinming saw a child crying in the crowded crowd and quickly took the child to a safe place.

　　把“雷锋精神”带进京城
    某戒严部队为群众送温暖
    新华社北京６月２日电  连日来，在京西的一些街巷，某戒严部队的干部、战士热情地为群众做好事，送温暖。群众称赞他们带着雷锋精神进京城。
    在石景山和门头沟区，记者看到戒严部队官兵冒着炎热清除垃圾和杂草，修补道路，在车站和公共场所扶老携幼，维持秩序，军民亲如一家。三家店街道卫生环境较差，１００多名官兵多次来到这里清扫，使街容面貌一新。部队的医务人员深入居民区巡诊，到一些街道、垃圾点喷药灭菌。驻地附近一位年已古稀的退休老职工，膝下无儿女，生活自理困难。干部战士得知后，主动帮他买米、搬煤、干杂活，老汉心里暖烘烘的。
    执行戒严任务以来，这支部队注重把雷锋全心全意为人民服务的精神变为广大官兵的实际行动。干部战士组织起上百个学雷锋小组。他们说“我们在奉命执行戒严任务的时候，更需要发扬雷锋精神，赢得人民的爱戴与信赖。”部队开进时，排长李战胜看到一名女孩被撞倒在人群中，他奋不顾身前去搭救。女孩脱险了，他却被人群踏伤，至今住在医院，伤未痊愈。科长董银明看到一名儿童在拥挤的人群中哭泣，赶忙将小孩抱到安全地带。
