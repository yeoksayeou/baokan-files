Xinhua News Agency, Warsaw, June 12th.

	Poland's Council of State met today to address the issue of 33 vacant seats in the new parliament.

	The results of the parliamentary elections on June 4 were unexpected: out of the 35 candidates proposed by the ruling coalition, only 2 were elected, while the remaining 33, including Prime Minister Rakowski and other key figures from various parties, all failed to secure a seat. This outcome caused a "great shock" within the coalition.

	According to the agreement reached by the Consultative Council established during the Round Table talks, the Council of State today amended the parliamentary election law. It was decided that in the second round of elections to be held on June 18, 33 additional seats would be added, distributed across 33 constituencies, with each seat contested by 2 candidates, and the winner determined by a simple majority. All 66 new parliamentary candidates will be proposed by the central leadership bodies of the various parties and organizations within the ruling coalition.

	Polish Prime Minister Rakowski announced on June 12 that he will not participate in the second round of parliamentary elections and will no longer seek a parliamentary seat.

	In his statement, Rakowski expressed that in order to respect the will of the voters, he has decided to abandon his electoral efforts and will not seek to enter the parliament. However, he also stated that he will not withdraw from public life. If the party and the state power organs, formed in accordance with the constitution, entrust him with a position that he can handle, he "will devote himself fully to serving the people in the new post."

	The chairman of the Polish parliament, the chairman of the United Peasants Party, Malinowski, and the member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Polish United Workers' Party, the chairman of the National Coordination Council of Polish Trade Unions, Miodowicz, as well as all 3 candidates from the Democratic Party, who were among the 35 parliamentary candidates on the "national list," also announced that they will not participate in the second round of elections after failing to secure a seat in the June 4 parliamentary elections.

　　波就议席空缺问题作出安排
    拉科夫斯基等宣布不再谋求议席
    新华社华沙６月１２日电  波兰国务委员会今天开会，就解决新议会出现的３３个议席空缺问题作出安排。
    ６月４日的议会大选结果出人意料：执政联盟提出的３５名议员候选人中只有２人当选，其余３３人，包括总理拉科夫斯基在内的各党派主要负责人，全部落选。这一结果在联盟派中引起“很大震动”。
    根据在圆桌会议上成立的协商委员会达成的妥协，国务委员会今天对议会选举法作了修改。决定在６月１８日举行的第二轮选举中增加３３个议员名额，分配到３３个选区中，每个名额由２名候选人争夺，最后以简单多数票当选。这全部６６名新的议员候选人全部由执政联盟的各党和组织的中央领导机构提出。
    新华社华沙６月１２日电　（记者董福生）波兰总理拉科夫斯基１２日发表声明，宣布不参加第二轮议员竞选，不再谋求议员席位。
    拉科夫斯基在声明中表示，为了尊重选民的意志，决定放弃竞选努力，不再争取进入议会。但他同时表示不退出“公共生活”。如果党和按照宪法产生的国家政权机构委任他能够胜任的职务，他“将在新岗位上全力以赴地为人民服务”。
    属于“国家名单”中３５名议员候选人之列的波兰议长、统一农民党主席马利诺夫斯基以及波兰统一工人党中央政治局委员、波兰工会全国协议会主席米奥多维奇和民主党方面的全部３名候选人，在６月４日议会大选中落选后，也已宣布不参加第二轮选举。
