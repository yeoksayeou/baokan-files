The results of the first round of Poland's general election were officially announced on June 8. According to materials released by the National Election Commission, a total of 165 people were elected as deputies to the Sejm (lower house), of which 5 are from the ruling alliance (composed of the United Workers' Party, United Peasant Party, Democratic Party, and three secular religious associations), and 160 are from the constructive opposition led by Solidarity. A total of 92 people were elected as senators, all of whom are from the opposition. Since many candidates for deputies and senators did not receive more than half of the votes, a second round of elections will be held on June 18.

Representatives of various political and social forces in Poland reached an agreement at the Round Table Conference: the Sejm elections would be conducted through proportional representation after the allocation of seats, while the Senate elections would be conducted through free competition. According to this agreement, the ruling alliance would occupy 65% of the seats in the Sejm, while the opposition would occupy 35%. Given that 33 out of the 35 candidates proposed by the ruling alliance failed in the first round of elections, the ruling alliance can actually only secure less than 58% of the seats. Even if their candidates win in the second round of elections, they will only hold a narrow majority in the future Sejm, while in the Senate, they will be completely in the minority. As for the opposition, the results of the first round of elections indicate that they have already secured nearly 35% of the seats in the Sejm, and have surprisingly taken 92% of the seats in the Senate.

Although the election has not yet concluded, the outcome is clear. The fall of various party and group leaders in the ruling alliance, including the Prime Minister and the Ministers of Defense and Internal Affairs, was unexpected. The reasons are multifaceted, but the primary cause lies in the deteriorating economic situation. Amidst market shortages, inflation, and rising prices, people are discontented due to the decline in their living standards. This sentiment inevitably reflected in the voting. Over the past 45 years, repeated economic and social crises have eroded people's trust in the authorities. As recently pointed out by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the United Workers' Party, this is the result of "complex political, economic, historical, and psychological factors."

The opposition led by Solidarity achieved a significant victory in the elections, which also came as a surprise. For a long time, Solidarity has been "denying everything" and adhering to a strategy of "struggle and confrontation." However, since the second half of last year, Solidarity has summarized past lessons, changed its approach, and no longer frequently calls for strikes and demonstrations. Instead, it advocates resolving contradictions and conflicts through "dialogue and compromise," thereby improving its image in the eyes of the people. During the election campaign, Solidarity's candidates emphasized social stability and thorough reform, which greatly won the favor of voters. The "Political Weekly" attributed the victory of the opposition led by Solidarity to "changing past practices" and "successfully employing strategies."

With the opposition entering the Sejm and the Senate, a new situation will emerge in Polish political life. Social contradictions and conflicts such as strikes, boycotts, demonstrations, and petitions will shift to the parliament, reflected in the competition among various parliamentary factions. Due to the opposition's majority in the Sejm, the government will face strict supervision and constraints from the parliament in the future, but this will also lead to conflicts and disputes between the government and the parliament.

The new Sejm and Senate face an important task: to promote political and economic reforms and help Poland emerge from the economic crisis as soon as possible. Whether the new parliament can complete this task is a test of Poland's parliamentary reform, as well as a severe test for the new parliament.

### 波兰大选结果说明了什么？

　　波兰大选结果说明了什么？
    新华社记者  汤德乔
    波兰大选的第一轮选举结果８日正式揭晓。根据全国选举委员会公布的材料，当选议会议员的总共１６５人，其中执政的联盟派（由统一工人党、统一农民党和民主党以及三个世俗宗教协会组成）５名，以团结工会为首的建设性反对派１６０名；当选参议员的总共９２人，全是反对派的候选人。由于许多议员和参议员候选人得票都未超过总数的一半，６月１８日将举行第二轮选举。
    波兰各政治和社会力量代表在圆桌会议上曾达成如下协议：议会选举按比例分配议席后竞选，而参议院选举则实行自由竞选。按照这个协议，联盟派将在议会中占６５％席位，反对派则占３５％席位。鉴于联盟派提出的３５个候选人中３３人在第一轮选举中落选，联盟派实际上只能获得不到５８％席位。即使他们的候选人在第二轮选举中获胜，他们在未来议会中也不过占微弱的多数，而在参议院中则完全占少数。至于反对派，第一轮选举结果表明，他们在议会中已获得近３５％席位，而在参议院竟然夺得了９２％席位。
    虽然这次大选尚未最后结束，但大局已定。执政联盟的各党派和团体负责人，其中包括政府总理和国防、内务部长落选是出人意料的。原因尽管是多方面的，但主要原因在于每况愈下的经济状况。在市场供应紧张、通货膨胀加剧、物价不断上涨的形势下，人们因生活水平下降而怨声载道。这种情绪不可避免地反映在投票上。４５年来，一次又一次的经济和社会危机削弱了人们对当局的信任。正如统一工人党中央政治局最近指出的那样，是“错综复杂的政治、经济、历史和心理因素起作用的结果”。
    以团结工会为首的反对派在选举中大胜也使人们感到突然。长期以来，团结工会“否定一切”，坚持“斗争和对抗”的策略。但自从去年下半年开始，团结工会总结了过去教训，改变了做法，不动辄号召罢工和举行示威，而主张通过“对话和妥协”解决矛盾、冲突，从而改善了自己在人们心目中的形象。团结工会的候选人在竞选活动中大谈社会安定，大讲彻底改革，这也在很大程度上赢得了选民的好感。《政治周刊》把以团结工会为首的反对派获胜说成是“改变过去做法”、“成功地运用策略”的结果。
    随着反对派进入议会和参议院，波兰政治生活中将出现一个新的局面，罢工罢课、游行示威、抗议请愿等社会矛盾和冲突将转移到议会中来，反映到各议会党团的角逐中来。由于反对派在议会占绝大多数，今后政府将受到议会严格的监督和制约，但也会因此而出现政府与议会之间的矛盾和纠葛。
    新的议会和参议院面临一项重要的任务——推进政治和经济改革，使波兰早日摆脱经济危机。新国会能否完成这项任务乃是波兰议会制度改革的考验，也是对新国会的一次严峻考验。 　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（新华社华沙６月９日电）
