Workers of Shougang Have Been Continuously Maintaining Normal Production

The 180,000 employees of the Capital Iron and Steel Company (Shougang) have been continuously maintaining normal production since the counter-revolutionary riot that occurred in the capital on June 3.

Shougang is one of the earliest large-scale industrial enterprises in China to implement the contract responsibility system, generating over 5 million yuan in profits daily. The normal production order at Shougang was seriously threatened after the counter-revolutionary riot on June 3.

Facing this situation, the Shougang Party Committee promptly organized the broad masses of employees to unify their thoughts, firmly align politically with the Party Central Committee, and steadfastly guard their posts at work. Shougang is located about 20 kilometers from the downtown area of Beijing in Shijingshan, with over 10,000 employees living in the city. To overcome transportation difficulties and ensure punctual attendance, they ride bicycles or walk for tens of kilometers to come to work, ensuring the normal operation of production equipment.
