Macau's first Municipal Assembly was established on June 3, with 13 members attending and signing their oaths of office. The first chairman of the Municipal Assembly, Mascarenhas, stated that the majority of the members being Chinese signifies an important step towards the localization of civil servants in the municipal administration.

This term of the Macau Municipal Assembly has 10 members elected either directly or indirectly, while the remaining 3 members are appointed by the Governor. Previously, all members of the municipal administration were appointed by the Governor.

Local opinion holds that this term of the Municipal Assembly has several distinctive features: for the first time, a significant number of Chinese residents have entered the assembly; the vast majority of the members are either long-term residents or have multiple generations of ancestry in Macau; all members can communicate directly in Cantonese. All of these factors will facilitate the smooth operation of administrative affairs.

　　澳门首届市政议会成立
    华人议员占多数
    新华社澳门６月５日电  澳门首届市政议会３日举行成立大会，１３名市政议员出席并签字就职。首任市政议会主席马斯华认为，华人议员在本届市政议会中占多数，标志着市政机构向公务员本地化迈出了重要一步。
    本届澳门市政议会有１０名议员分别由直接和间接选举产生，其他３名议员由澳督委任。而在此之前，市政机构的成员全部由澳督委任。
    此间舆论指出，本届市政议会具有多个特点：第一次有这么多华籍居民议员进入议会；绝大部分议员都是多代或长期居住在澳门的中葡籍人士；全部议员都可以直接用粤语交流沟通。所有这些都有利于行政运作的顺利进行。
