In recent years, holding exhibitions has become a trend. The effects are mixed, with both praise and criticism. Examining Beijing's exhibitions, everyone hopes for: strengthening management and establishing a new order for exhibitions.

In the spring of 1983, during the Chinese New Year, the Beijing Agricultural Exhibition Hall held its first Agricultural, Industrial, and Commercial Exhibition, which became news and caused a sensation throughout the city.

Once the precedent was set, various types of exhibitions, such as "new trend" furniture, "new trend" clothing, and "new trend" home appliances, came one after another. Exhibitions became a popular place to chase after the latest trends. Just in Beijing Exhibition Hall, about 30 different types of exhibitions were held last year; this year, from January to April, 13 more were held.

The exhibitors included ministries, state-owned enterprises, collective units, and individual business households. The products on display covered food, clothing, housing, daily necessities, and transportation. The exhibition venues became "prime real estate," and customers found it more convenient to visit one exhibition than to run around multiple stores, allowing them to choose the best products. Exhibitions indeed opened another channel for commodity circulation.

For the exhibition halls, organizing units, and exhibitors, most exhibitions brought in substantial profits. Many exhibition halls in Beijing gradually implemented self-sufficiency, covering rent, water, electricity, heating, construction, salaries, and bonuses. They relied on exhibitions as their "money tree" and "treasure trove."

However, managing this "money tree" and "treasure trove" is also quite challenging. Although since 1986, in addition to the exhibition halls, departments such as public security, fire protection, industry and commerce, prices, taxation, and health quarantine have jointly managed the exhibitions, the improvement in management capabilities has lagged far behind the expansion of exhibitions. During this year's Women's Day, the Women and Children's Products Exhibition had banners hanging in the Beijing Exhibition Hall, attracting over 160,000 women from urban and suburban areas. The colorful clothing and the surging crowd even bent the iron railings that were as thick as a cup.

Passing off fake goods as genuine, hiring "stooges" to praise products, and using inferior goods to pass off as high-quality ones. Consumers suffered, while the "bosses" profited.

As the saying goes, "Murky waters are good for fishing." Exhibitions with relatively loose management are like a pool of "murky water." Sometimes, 80% of the booths in an exhibition are rented by individual business households. Even state-owned and collective units find it difficult to maintain integrity in such an environment. These people pass off inferior goods as high-quality ones, shortchange customers, sell fake goods, and default on payments. A piece of pure synthetic fiber fabric is labeled as "pure wool fabric"; a package of acrylic yarn is labeled as containing "50% wool"… As a result, customers pay several times the actual price. Fake "Dukang" liquor from Henan and "one-week shoes" from Fujian have all deceived customers. The worst are the furniture items, which, once moved home, have cracks, glue issues, doors that don't close properly, drawers that won't open, sofas that collapse when sat on, and cabinets with peeling surfaces… causing consumers to suffer.

Another annoying issue is that sellers of fabric, yarn, and clothing hire "stooges." These "stooges" are mostly women in their forties, who are eloquent and can "make the dead speak." They might stop a young woman and say, "Sister, look at this wool fabric, it's so durable!" or approach an elderly couple and say, "This yarn is really good, I heard it's going to increase in price soon!" Countless consumers are deceived by these "stooges."

"Don't the management staff see this?" The staff from the exhibition hall explained, "It's not that we don't care, but we can't manage it all. Some exhibitors even set up lookouts. When they see the management staff, they give a signal, and immediately switch from fake to genuine goods. As soon as the management staff leave, they go back to passing off fakes as genuine."

"What about the tax situation?" we asked. "There are quite a few individual business households who evade or resist taxes. During this year's Spring Festival, a fruit vendor from Shandong made 40,000 yuan and was caught by the tax authorities, who made him pay 3,000 yuan in back taxes in one go."

Enforce the law to rectify and establish a new order for exhibitions; crack down on illegal operations and behaviors that harm consumers.

Often, customers find out they have bought inferior goods only after the exhibition has ended. Customers can only seek help from the venue (exhibition hall, etc.). Old Cao from the Beijing Exhibition Hall said, "We take the blame for others, and we have suffered many unjust accusations!"

Originally, the general procedure for holding an exhibition is that the venue rents out the space to the organizing unit for a fee, and the organizing unit then invites exhibitors to set up booths and sell goods.

"The key is all about money!" A colleague from the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce said bluntly, "Whether the exhibition venue is idle or not, the rent is high, and the price department doesn't care, so they charge exorbitant prices and collect money on the spot. The organizing unit is even more crazy about money, not caring whether the exhibitors have a license or not, as long as they pay, it's fine. The exhibitors then turn around and exploit the consumers."

On February 23 this year, the Beijing Municipal People's Government issued the "Temporary Regulations on the Management of Daily Necessities Exhibitions in Beijing." As a local regulation, it was issued ahead of other cities in the country. The key points of this regulation are twofold: first, it specifies the qualifications for the organizing unit and exhibitors. The organizing unit must be a corporate entity that can independently assume civil liability. Exhibitors must be enterprises or individual business households with a business license. Any exhibition must first apply to the industry and commerce administration for a permit before it can be held. Second, it stipulates penalties for violators, including confiscating all illegal gains and paying a certain proportion of fines.

"With the regulations in place, can we ensure that the law is enforced?" "How can we further develop exhibitions without stifling them?" We expressed our concerns. The colleague from the Municipal Bureau of Industry and Commerce candidly said, "As of now, the common problem in the enforcement of economic laws is that the law is not enforced. On the one hand, the enforcement departments need to take their responsibilities seriously and ensure that the law is enforced; on the other hand, all relevant departments in society need to work closely together, especially the broad masses of consumers need to actively report and supervise. Only by continuously improving the regulations and cultivating the necessary order can exhibition activities develop healthily."

　　近两年，办展销会成了时髦。效果如何？人们褒贬不一。透视北京的展销会，大家希望：    
    加强管理建立展销新秩序
    董焕亮　王静
    北京农展馆。１９８３年春节期间，这里第一次举办农工商展销会，成了新闻，全市轰动。
    先河一开，“新潮”家具、“新潮”服装、“新潮”家电……各种各样的展销会，纷至沓来，展销会成了追赶“新潮”的好去处。仅北京展览馆，去年就举办了各种类型的展销会约３０个；今年１至４月，又举办了１３个。
    展销会的参展单位，有国家部委、国营企业、集体单位，也有个体工商户。参加展销的商品遍及吃、穿、住、用、行。举办场所成了“寸金之地”，顾客们光顾一个展销会，胜于跑十几家、几十家商店，购货择优。展销会确为商品流通多开了一道闸门。
    而对于展览馆、主办单位、参展单位来说，绝大多数展销会赢来了丰厚的利润。北京不少展览馆逐步实行了自负盈亏，房费、水电费、暖气费、基建费、工资、奖金自理，依靠的就是展销会这“摇钱树”和“聚宝盆”。
    可这“摇钱树”、“聚宝盆”，管理起来却也颇有难度。虽说自１９８６年起，除展览馆外，公安、消防、工商、物价、税务、卫生检疫等部门联席办公，齐抓共管，但管理能力的提高远远跟不上展销的扩展。今年“三八”妇女节，妇女儿童用品展销会的横幅在北京展览馆招摇，来自市区、郊区的１．６万余名女同胞，拥塞在馆外，赤橙黄绿青蓝紫的各色服装，呼啦啦飘展，蜂拥而来的亢奋的人潮竟将口杯粗的铁栏杆都挤弯了……
    以假充真，有人望风；以次充好，雇“托”帮腔。苦了消费者，肥了众“老板”
    常言道：“浑水好摸鱼”。管理相对松弛的展销会，似一池“浑水”。有时，一个展销会的摊位，被个体户租去的占８０％。即使是国营、集体单位，此时也难做到洁身守正。这些人以次充好，缺斤短两，卖假货，赖账，一匹纯化纤的花呢，说是“全毛花呢”；一包腈纶毛线，标以“含５０％羊毛”……结果，顾客多掏数倍的钱。河南的假“杜康酒”，福建的“一周鞋”（旅游鞋，只能穿一星期），等等，都曾骗过顾客。最糟糕的是家具，搬回家后，裂口的、开胶的、门关不严的、抽屉拉不开的，沙发一坐就塌的、组合柜贴面脱落的……令消费者叫苦不迭。
    还有讨厌的，就是卖布、卖毛线、卖服装的雇“托”。“托”，大半是四十岁上下的妇女，能说会道，“死人都让她说活了”。一会儿拦着一位年轻妇女说，“大姐，你看这毛料多好！可经穿着呢”；一会儿凑近一对老年夫妇说“这毛线确实不赖，听说快要涨价了！”难以数计的消费者被“托”所诳。
    “难道管理人员看不到吗？”展览馆的同志解释道：“不是我们不管，可管不过来。有的参展单位还设立望风人员，见到管理人员，一个暗号，马上撤假换真；管理人员一走，照旧以假充真”。
    “税收情况怎么样？”我们又问。“漏税、抗税的个体户为数不少。今年春节，来自山东的一个卖苹果的商贩，赚了４万，被税务人员查出来，一次就补交了税款３０００元”。
    依法整顿、建立展销新秩序；打击非法经营和坑害消费者行为
    常常有这样的情况，顾客买了劣质货，发现时，展销会已鸣金走人了。顾客只好找举办场所（展览馆等），北京展览馆的老曹说：“我们代人受过，蒙受了许多不白之冤！”
    原来，办展销会的一般程序是，举办场所把场地有偿租给主办单位，主办单位再拉愿展销产品的参展单位摆摊售货。
    “关键都是为了钱！”市工商局的同志一针见血地说：“展览场地闲着也都闲着，租出去，租金多高物价部门也不管的，于是漫天索价，就地还钱。主办单位则想钱想得更疯，不管有照无照，交钱就行。参展单位转过头就拚命搜刮消费者。”
    今年２月２３日，北京市人民政府发布《北京市生活用品展销会管理暂行规定》。作为一项地方法规，它的发布是走在全国其他城市前面的。这项法规的要点有二：一是对主办单位、参展单位的资格作了规定。主办单位必须是企业法人，能够独立承担民事责任。参展单位必须是持有营业执照的企业或个体工商户。任何展销会都要先向工商行政管理机关申请，领取许可证后，方可举办。二是规定了对违犯法规者的罚则，除没收全部非法所得外，还必须缴纳一定比例的罚金。
    “有了法规，能不能做到有法必依？”“如何进一步发展展销，而不是管死？”我们对此表示关切。市工商局的同志坦诚地说：“迄止目前，有法不依是经济法规执行中常见的毛病。这一方面需要执法部门切实负起责来，做到有法必依；另一方面需要全社会有关部门紧密协同配合，特别需要广大消费者积极举报、监督。只有不断完善法规，培育、形成必要的秩序，展销活动才能健康发展。”
