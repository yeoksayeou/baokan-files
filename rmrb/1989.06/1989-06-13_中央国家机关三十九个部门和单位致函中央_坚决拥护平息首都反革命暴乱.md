Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 12th.

Recently, 39 departments and units under the Central Government have written to the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, firmly supporting the major decision to suppress the counter-revolutionary riots.

These departments and units include: the State Ethnic Affairs Commission, the State Education Commission, the Ministry of Personnel, the Ministry of Labor, the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Agriculture, the Ministry of Culture, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, the Ministry of Health, the Chinese Academy of Sciences, the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences, the National Audit Office, the National Bureau of Statistics, the State Bureau of Building Materials, the National Tourism Administration, the State Pharmaceutical Administration, the State Environmental Protection Administration, the State Bureau of Foreign Experts, the State Land Administration, the Civil Aviation Administration of China, the China Earthquake Administration, the State Intellectual Property Office, the State Administration of Cultural Heritage, the Taiwan Affairs Office of the State Council, the State Council's Office for the Special Economic Zones, the China International Trust and Investment Corporation, the China Rural Trust and Investment Corporation, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China, the Agricultural Bank of China, the China Construction Bank, the People's Insurance Company of China, the China Disabled Persons' Federation, the All-China Federation of Returned Overseas Chinese, the National Natural Science Foundation of China, the Rural Development Research Center of the State Council, the Three Gorges Region Economic Development Office of the State Council, and the China Electronics Technology Group Corporation.

In recent days, these departments have organized their Party members, cadres, and staff to study the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Nation" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, listen to Deng Xiaoping's speech at the meeting of military officers above the rank of major general, and watch and listen to radio and television broadcasts exposing the truth about the counter-revolutionary riots. Everyone agrees that over the past month, a small number of people have deliberately incited and created turmoil, which has developed into a shocking counter-revolutionary riot. Their evil intentions are to attempt to deny the leadership of the Communist Party of China, deny the socialist system, and overthrow the People's Republic of China. This is a severe struggle concerning the fate of the Party and the country. If the riot is not suppressed, the Party will have no peace, the country will have no peace, and reform and opening up and modernization construction will become a mere dream. The Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission have taken decisive and resolute measures to quickly suppress the riot, representing the fundamental interests of the entire Party and the people of the nation, expressing the common wishes of the entire Party and the people of the nation, and this is completely correct. We firmly support this and express our highest respect and sincere greetings to the martial law troops, all officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, public security officers, and armed police who have successfully completed the task of suppressing this counter-revolutionary riot.

Some departments have also studied and formulated specific measures to implement the Party Central Committee and the State Council's requirements for stabilizing the situation, in accordance with the characteristics of their departments or industries. The State Ethnic Affairs Commission emphasized that under the leadership of the Party, we must correctly handle and resolve various problems existing in ethnic relations, be vigilant against the instigation and sowing of discord by domestic and foreign separatist forces, and resolutely expose and oppose all conspiracies to sabotage ethnic unity and national unity. The Ministry of Agriculture requires that the department and industry cadres and staff must overcome all difficulties, stay at their posts, and do everything possible to ensure a bumper harvest of summer grain and oil, and strive for a bumper harvest in all aspects of agriculture this year. The Ministry of Health clearly proposed that the department and its affiliated units' staff must firmly maintain normal work and living order, strengthen duty shifts, timely grasp the epidemic situation, and do a good job of coordination, service, and command work. At present, it is especially important to do a good job of treating the wounded and normal disease prevention and treatment work. The China Earthquake Administration has strengthened security and duty shifts, ensuring the timely transmission of information and materials and earthquake monitoring and forecasting work. The Civil Aviation Administration of China emphasized that all levels of leadership and staff must stay at their posts, perform their duties, and at the same time strengthen the security of airports, offices, and key departments.
