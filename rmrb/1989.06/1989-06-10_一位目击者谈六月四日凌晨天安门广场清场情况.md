	The following material is based on an interview with a cadre from a government agency. To protect the interviewee's safety, the interviewee's name and workplace have been omitted.

	Question: I heard that you were at Tiananmen Square from the night of June 3 to the early morning of June 4 and witnessed the entire sequence of events. There are rumors outside that on that night, the soldiers were injured and many students were harmed. What is the actual situation? We would like to ask you to describe it.

	First, I would like to ask you a question: What time did you arrive at your shop?

	Answer: I work at a shop on the east side of Tiananmen Square. On that day, I heard there was a situation, and I arrived at Tiananmen Square around 1:50 AM on June 4.

	Question: It is said that by 1:30 AM, the troops had already started to enforce martial law. How were you able to enter at that time?

	Answer: At that time, martial law was enforced on East and West Chang'an Streets, but it did not cross the central axis of Chang'an Street. I came from the south and did not encounter any obstacles.

	Question: Can you describe the situation you saw after entering the square?

	Answer: After I entered, I saw that the situation was chaotic, but not as chaotic as I had imagined before I arrived. When I came, there were many onlookers in the square and around the Monument to the People's Heroes. Some university students were arguing about whether to withdraw. The martial law troops were north of the central axis of Chang'an Street, in front of the Gate of Heavenly Peace, and had not entered the square.

	Question: Can you describe the process of the students arguing whether to withdraw or not?

	Answer: At that time, some students said, "I think we should be rational. The government has already sent in the troops, we should be rational and withdraw." Another group of students said, "We have persisted here for so long, and since we are already here, it would not be appropriate for us to leave. We think we should stay here and persist to the end."

	Question: When did the broadcast call for students to withdraw from the square?

	Answer: The broadcast in Tiananmen Square started at 1:50 AM, almost every five minutes, continuously for more than two hours, from 1:50 AM to around 3:55 AM.

	Question: By 3:55 AM, did you see any students still in the square?

	Answer: At 3:50 AM, there were still many students in the square, and there were also many onlookers. The debate on whether to withdraw had reached a climax.

	Question: What was the final conclusion of their debate?

	Answer: After 3:50 AM, around 4:00 AM, the martial law command center on the Great Hall of the People repeatedly read the "Notice" again. Then, the lights in the square were turned off. The square became chaotic, believing that the troops were about to take action. Some onlookers ran out from the southeast corner of the square. At that time, the troops had not taken any action.

	Question: Did the students also start to run at that time?

	Answer: The students did not run out. Around 4:20 AM, they were still arguing and had not reached a conclusion. Later, in the broadcast, Hou Dejian, who participated in the hunger strike, said, "I would like to express a personal opinion. I think we have already achieved victory. We do not need to stay here any longer. I think we should be rational and withdraw."

	Question: After the students heard this, did they start to withdraw from the square in an orderly manner?

	Answer: After the students heard this, there were two reactions: one was to prepare to withdraw, and this group was larger. The other group still wanted to persist. Some onlookers thought that withdrawing was reasonable. Others thought that after persisting for so long, why should they withdraw? There were also two reactions.

	Question: How were you able to hear their different opinions so clearly?

	Answer: Because I was in the square, right at the base of the Monument to the People's Heroes. Almost every day for the past month or two, I have been on duty at the shop, and I wanted to clarify this issue and see how it was resolved.

	Question: When did the students start to withdraw from the square?

	Answer: Around 4:40 AM to 4:55 AM, the students gradually lined up. When the students were preparing to withdraw, they could not vote on the issue. I heard some students cursing "Beida Autonomous Federation," saying they could not find anyone at this time. Later, a student from an unknown school said in the broadcast, "We cannot hold an emergency meeting now. Let's vote. The method is that I count 1, 2, 3. Those who support withdrawal shout 'withdraw,' and those who want to stay shout 'stay.' The minority will obey the majority." After repeating this several times, he counted 1, 2, 3. After counting, the shout for withdrawal was much louder than the shout for staying. Thus, the students prepared to withdraw from the southeast corner of the square. At this time, the martial law command center on the Great Hall of the People immediately responded, saying they agreed with the students' immediate withdrawal and that the troops would not take any action. After that, the students withdrew in groups of five, carrying their school flags.

	Question: During the withdrawal process, did you see the soldiers take any action against the students?

	Answer: During the students' withdrawal, the soldiers did not take any action. When the students were withdrawing, the troops gradually moved south from Tiananmen. The students also gradually moved south. The distance between the troops and the armored vehicles and the crowd and students was at least ten meters, and at most fifty or sixty meters.

	Question: Did the armored vehicles fire at that time?

	Answer: No, the armored vehicles did not fire, and the troops did not fire.

	Question: After the students withdrew, there were still many tents in the square. Did you see any students who did not want to leave?

	Answer: At that time, outside the square, there were a few students who did not want to leave. Some students, due to their long stay, were in very poor physical condition. In other words, they could hardly control themselves, sitting there and staring blankly. The martial law troops' soldiers helped these students up and gathered them in front of the entrance of the Memorial Hall. After checking each tent, the armored vehicles came in. I saw with my own eyes that there was no one in the tents.

	Question: Does this mean that the armored vehicles only came in after the soldiers checked each tent and confirmed that there were no students left inside, and then they drove the armored vehicles in?

	Answer: Yes, that's correct.

	Question: So, there was no incident of armored vehicles running over students or soldiers shooting students, right?

	Answer: Absolutely correct.

	Question: Some people said that there was a fire in Tiananmen Square. Can you explain what happened?

	Answer: Regarding the fire in Tiananmen Square, before the students withdrew, some onlookers and individual students burned the donated cotton jackets, new wool blankets that were used for the first time and got dirty, and new quilts. They set them on fire and threw them onto the barricades, thinking it could prevent the armored vehicles from coming in. The fire burned until the next morning. The troops did not extinguish it because there was a lot of garbage in the square, and it all burned. I think that's what happened.

	Question: Did you see this phenomenon: the troops coming to burn things? Did you see that?

	Answer: At that time, the square was under martial law. I saw the fire set by the onlookers and students. I did not see if the martial law troops burned anything.

	Question: When did the martial law troops complete the clearing of the square, and when did all the students withdraw?

	Answer: Around 4:50 AM to 5:30 AM.

	Question: During this process, did any shots ring out in Tiananmen Square?

	Answer: No, there were no shots.

	Question: Did Tiananmen Square remain quiet all night without any shots?

	Answer: No, there were shots on East Chang'an Street before 1:50 AM and after 12:00 AM.

	Question: Did any shots ring out in the square?

	Answer: No, there were no shots in the square.

	Question: Some people said that shots rang out in the square after 5:30 AM. Were you at the scene at that time? Did you see this situation?

	Answer: Around 6:00 AM, the students had already left the square, and the martial law troops had reached Qianmen Street. There was no one left in the square. There were shots, which were a fact. It was from a building outside the square. Someone said that there were people with weapons on the roof shooting at the martial law troops. This was before the troops took action, and someone was shooting over there. At that time, the troops were preparing to search the area. There were onlookers on the roof. The troops ordered them to come down, but they did not. The troops fired shots into the air to signal them to leave.

	Question: So, the shots were fired from a building outside the square into the square. After the troops entered the square, they sent soldiers to search the building, right?

	Answer: Yes, that's correct.

	Question: I have another question. During the process of the troops and armored vehicles driving the students out of the square, did the students show any reaction?

	Answer: During the clearing process, the distance between the armored vehicles and the crowd and students was 50 meters at the farthest and 10 meters at the closest. At this time, some onlookers threw bottles and bricks at the armored vehicles.

	Question: I have another question. As an eyewitness or bystander at that time, how did the troops treat you personally during the clearing process?

	Answer: During the withdrawal of the crowd and students, I followed the crowd out. At that time, I was only about 10 meters away from the armored vehicles. After the clearing was completed, I stood at the door of our unit. The crowd continued to move south, and I returned to our unit. The martial law troops began to search. During the search, the martial law troops discovered that there were weapons in our location. A soldier stood guard, aiming his gun at me for over an hour.

	Question: What were you doing during this hour?

	Answer: During this hour, I was sitting at the door of our unit, watching the troops clear the area, and smoking.

	Question: Did you talk to the soldier?

	Answer: No, I did not.

	Question: After that night, I heard that some people called you to ask about the situation in Tiananmen Square. How did you respond?

	Answer: After that, around 6:00 AM and 7:00 AM, people who knew me, colleagues from my unit, and some people from outside the province called long-distance, knowing that our unit was on the east side of Tiananmen Square. They asked if there was a bloody incident in Tiananmen Square and if the blood was more than an inch thick. I said there was no such situation. In fact, during the clearing process, that is, from 1:50 AM to 5:30 AM, there was no bloody incident, and there were no shots. They called to ask about the situation and suspected, "Is there a soldier with a gun next to you, not letting you speak?" I said there was no such problem.

	Question: What has been the situation in the past two days? You are still in the shop, and there are troops all around. Can you describe the situation in the past two days?

	Answer: Starting from 10:00 AM on June 4, we began to partially reopen, of course, this partial reopening is only for the martial law troops. The soldiers are very disciplined and respectful to the colleagues in this place, especially the night shift workers. The commander of the martial law command center came to us several times to ask, "Have our soldiers been undisciplined? If there is such a situation, do not hesitate to report it to us, and we will deal with it strictly."

	Question: Are the other shops in Tiananmen Square open now?

	Answer: In Tiananmen Square, there are two small shops at the south gate of the Memorial Hall, selling cigarettes and some beverages to the soldiers. On the east side, north of the History Museum, there are also shops selling cigarettes to the soldiers. The others are not open for business.

	Question: You have been in the shop for the past two days. How do you think the soldiers are living?

	Answer: During this martial law period, up to the 7th, some troops have been here since June 3. When they came in, they were obstructed, and some supply vehicles were burned. Therefore, many soldiers came in with very little food and no water. They often came to our shop to ask for tap water to drink. Their food was compressed biscuits, about half a pound per bag, four pieces, and one piece was enough for four people to eat for a day. As for sleeping, they only laid a raincoat on the ground, with no blankets. They slept on the concrete floor with their helmets as pillows.

	Question: So, they are living very hard, but from your observation, have there been any disciplinary violations?

	Answer: Absolutely not. Because we brought our own food to eat, the soldiers came to our shop to buy things and saw that we had food. They were envious and hoped we could help them. We saw that the soldiers were living very hard and were already exhausted. The day before yesterday, in the afternoon, we helped some soldiers buy several hundred bags of instant noodles and some pickled vegetables.

　　一位目击者谈六月四日凌晨天安门广场清场情况
    《北京日报》按：这份材料是根据一位机关干部的采访录音整理的。为保护被采访人的安全，文中省略了被采访人的姓名和单位。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    问：听说您在６月３日夜里到６月４日早晨这一段时间一直在天安门广场，从您的位置看到了天安门广场发生的全部事情。现在外头传说，那天夜里天安门广场伤了解放军，伤害了很多的学生。事实情况到底怎么样？我们想请您介绍一下。
    首先我要问您一个问题，您是几点钟到您的商店的？
    答：我是一家商店的，在天安门广场东侧路。那天听说有情况，我是在４号凌晨１点５０分左右到了天安门广场。
    问：天安门广场在１点半的时候，据说部队已经开始警戒了。那您这个时候怎么能进来呢？
    答：当时部队戒严是在东西长安街上，没有过长安街的中轴线，我从南边过来，没有受到任何阻拦。
    问：您能不能说明一下，进场以后您看到的一些情况？
    答：当我进场以后，我看到当时的情况比较乱。但不像我没来之前想象的那么乱。因为我来的时候有很多的围观群众，在广场上，在纪念碑周围，有一些大学生围着互相争吵是否撤离的问题。至于戒严部队那个时候在长安街中轴线以北、天安门城楼前，没有进入广场范围内。
    问：大学生们争论撤还是不撤的过程您能不能说一下？
    答：当时一部分大学生说，我觉得我们应该理智，现在政府已经派入军队，我们应理智一些撤走。还有一部分大学生说，我们在这里坚持这么长时间，反正已经来了，走嘛对我们来说不大合适，我们觉得还是应该呆在这个地方坚持到底。
    问：是什么时候广播叫学生撤离广场的？
    答：天安门广场１点５０分已经广播了，几乎是每一遍用５分钟的时间，不间断地广播了２个多小时，从１点５０分一直广播到３点５５分左右。
    问：到３点５５分左右的时候，您看广场上还有没有学生？
    答：在３点５０分的时候，广场上的学生还是比较多的，围观群众也比较多，已经达到比较高潮的时期，就是争论到底是否撤离。
    问：最后他们的结论是撤还是不撤？
    答：在３点５０分以后到４点钟的时候，这段时间，在人民大会堂上戒严指挥部又重新反复念了《通告》以后，广场的灯关闭了。这时广场上哗然，认为部队马上就要采取行动，有一部分围观群众，从广场的东南角往外边跑，当时部队并没有行动。
    问：学生这时是不是也开始跑了？
    答：学生当时没有往外跑。在４点２０分左右，他们还是争论，一直没有争论出结果，后来就在广播上去争论，争论以后呢，当时去参加绝食的叫侯德健的说：“我发表一个个人意见”，说“我认为我们已经取得了胜利，我们没有必要在这个地方再留守。我认为我们应该理智，应该撤离。”
    问：学生听到这个以后，是不是就开始整队撤离广场了呢？
    答：学生听到以后，有两种反应：一种就是准备撤离，人数比较多。另外一个就是还有一部分是想坚持。一部分围观群众已经认为撤离是合理。还有一部分说坚持这么长时间，为什么要撤？也有两种反应。
    问：您怎么能够这么清楚听到他们的这些不同意见？
    答：因为当时我在广场，就在纪念碑底下，因为将近一两个月的时间，我几乎天天在商店值班，我也愿意把这个问题搞清楚，看看到底这个问题是怎么解决的。
    问：学生是什么时候开始撤离广场的？
    答：大约是在４点４０分左右到４点５５分左右，学生逐步排起队来，在学生准备撤离的时候，他们当时无法表决意见，当时我听到部分学生在骂“高自联”的，就说他们到这个时候找不到人了。以后，不知是哪个学校的学生在广播里说，我们现在也无法再开什么紧急会议了，咱们现在表决一下，表决方式就是我数１、２、３，主张撤离的就喊“撤离”，愿意留守的就喊“留守”，根据人的多少，少数服从多数，反复说了几遍后，他就喊１、２、３。喊完１、２、３后，喊撤离的比喊留守的声音多得多，于是学生就准备从广场的东南角撤离。这时，在人民大会堂戒严部队指挥部的喇叭里马上给予了回答，说同意学生马上撤离，部队不采取什么行动，以后学生就五人一排，打着各校的旗子开始向外撤离。
    问：在撤离过程中，您看到解放军对学生有没有什么行动？
    答：在学生撤离的过程中，解放军没有采取任何行动。撤离时，部队从天安门逐步往广场这边南移，学生也逐步南移。部队和装甲车距群众和学生最近的也有十几米，最远的有五六十米。
    问：这时装甲车上没有开枪吧？
    答：没有开枪，部队也没有开枪。
    问：学生在撤离后，广场上还有很多帐篷，据你所见还有没有留下不走的学生？
    答：当时在广场外面有个别的学生，也是不愿意走，少数学生由于长期在这个地方，身体状况极差，换句话说他们几乎不能自制，坐在那儿呆呆地看，戒严部队的战士把这些学生搀起来，集中在纪念堂的正门前。在检查了每个帐篷后，装甲车才开过来，我亲眼看着帐篷里没有人。
    问：是不是说装甲车开过来之前，战士们把每个帐篷都检查之后，确信里面没有留下学生，才把装甲车开过来的？
    答：是这样的。
    问：那就是说根本没有装甲车轧学生或是战士开枪打学生的事，是不是这样？
    答：完全是这样的。
    问：那以后有人说天安门广场起了火，这个你能不能说一下是怎么回事？
    答：至于天安门广场起了火这个问题，是在学生撤离之前，一些围观群众和个别学生把他们穿的那些捐赠来的棉袄，还有看见明明就是新毛毯，第一次使用踏脏了的那种毛毯，还有新的棉被，他们用火点着了。点着以后，他们扔到路障上，觉得能够防止装甲车开过来。火烧到第二天凌晨以后，部队也没有扑灭它，因为当时广场垃圾很多，一起都烧了，我估计就是这样。
    问：这个现象您看到了没有：就是部队来烧东西您看到了没有？
    答：当时广场戒严了，我看到着的火是围观群众和学生点的，戒严部队是否烧我没看到。
    问：戒严部队最后清场，学生全部撤离完大体上是什么时间？
    答：大体是在４点５０——５点３０左右。
    问：这个过程中，天安门广场响了枪没有？
    答：没有响枪。
    问：当天夜里，天安门广场是不是整夜都没有响枪？
    答：那不是，东长安街１点５０以前１２点以后有枪声。
    问：广场上响过枪没有？
    答：广场上没有响枪。
    问：有人说广场上５点３０以后响起了枪声，您当时在现场，您看到这个情况吗？
    答：６点钟左右，学生已经离开广场，戒严部队已经到了前门大街，广场上已经没有人了。有枪声也是事实，是广场外面一个楼房，有人说上面有人持武器朝戒严部队开枪，那是在戒严部队行动之前，有人往那边打枪。这时部队准备往这边查，楼上有围观的人，部队勒令他们下去，他们不下去，部队朝天上放枪，示意让他们离开。
    问：那就是说这个枪声是从广场外的楼里向广场射出的子弹。部队进入广场以后，部队派出战士搜索这座楼，是不是这样？
    答：是这么回事。
    问：我再问您一个问题，就是装甲车、部队把学生赶出广场这个过程中，学生们有什么表示没有？
    答：在部队清场的过程中，装甲车和群众、学生距离有５０米的，有１０米的；在这个时候，有部分围观群众，往装甲车上扔瓶子和砖头。
    问：再想问您一个问题，就是解放军在清场过程中，您作为当时的一个目击者，或者说是一个旁观者，部队对您本人是怎么个态度？
    答：在群众撤离和学生撤离的过程中，我是随着群众一起往外走的。当时我离装甲车也就只有１０米远。清场完了以后，我就在我们单位门口站住了。群众就继续往南走，我回到了我们单位，戒严部队就开始搜索，搜索的时候，戒严部队发现我们所在的地方有带武器的，有一个战士作为戒备，枪口对着我瞄了一个多小时。
    问：这一个多小时，您在干什么？
    答：这一个多小时，我就在我们门口这个地方坐着，看着部队如何清场，我在抽烟。
    问：您跟这个战士讲话了没有？
    答：当时没有讲。
    问：那天夜里过了以后，我听说有一些人打电话问您当时天安门广场情况，您是怎么回答的？
    答：那天过了以后，６点多钟、７点多钟，开始有认识我的人和我单位的同事，还有一些外地人打长途来，因为他们知道我们这个单位是在天安门广场东侧路。问天安门广场是不是发生了流血事件，说血是不是有一寸多厚？当时我说，没有这种情况，确实在清场这个过程中，也就是说在１点５０——５点３０分的过程中，没有出现流血事件，也没有出现枪声。他们打电话问情况的就怀疑，说：“是不是你旁边有解放军拿枪对着你，不让你说？”我说根本不存在这个问题。
    问：最近两天情况怎么样？因为您现在还在这个商店，而且周围全是部队。您能不能讲一下您最近两天的情况？
    答：从６月４日上午１０点多钟开始起，我们就开始部分营业了，当然这个部分营业只是对着戒严部队。战士们都是严守纪律的，对我们这个地方的同志，值夜班的老同志，都是比较尊重的，特别是戒严指挥部的首长，他几次到我们这来询问：“我们的战士有没有不守纪律？如果有这种情况，你不要有任何顾虑，报告我们，我们会严加处置的。”
    问：天安门广场其他商店目前开门没有？
    答：天安门广场在纪念堂的南门，有两个商亭，向战士出售香烟和部分饮料，广场的东侧往北的历史博物馆那边，也有向战士出售香烟的，其他的就没有什么营业的了。
    问：您这两天一直在商店里边，您看战士生活得怎样？
    答：在戒严的这段时间里头，至今天为止是７号了，有些部队是从６月３日进来的，由于他们进来的时候受阻，部分军需车被烧毁，所以说很多战士进来以后，食品非常的少，而且也没有水。他们经常到我们门市部来要自来水喝，他们吃的干粮都是压缩饼干，就说半斤一袋的压缩饼干吧，四块，其中一块，甚至要四个人吃一天。至于睡觉啊，他们只是在地上铺一个雨衣，也没有被子，头枕着钢盔在水泥地上睡的觉。
    问：那就是说，他们生活很艰苦的，但是据您观察有没有违反纪律的情况？
    答：绝对没有违反纪律的情况。因为我们自己带着饭吃，战士到我们这来买东西，看见我们有吃的，很羡慕，希望我们帮助他们一下。我们看到战士生活得很艰苦，而且已经疲惫不堪了，在前天下午的时候，我们帮助一部分战士买了几百袋方便面和一些榨菜。
