Xinhua News Agency, Washington, June 21st.

Former U.S. Ambassador to China, Leonard Woodcock, today expressed his hope that Americans doing business in China would return to the country.

Woodcock, in an interview with the CBS television program "This Morning," said that the U.S. government had advised and urged American citizens to leave China due to concerns over events in China that might endanger Americans. Now, it seems the crisis has passed.

The 69-year-old Woodcock served as the U.S. Ambassador to China from 1981 to 1985. When discussing how the U.S. government should respond to recent events in China, he said, "An important point is not to put oneself in a position where one cannot back down," and "weighing the pros and cons is important."

    希望在华经商的美国人返华
    新华社华盛顿6月21日电  美国前驻华大使恒安石今天表示希望在中国经商的美国人返回中国。
    恒安石在接受哥伦比亚广播公司电视网《今晨》专题节目记者采访时说，美国政府要求和劝告美国公民从中国撤离，是因为担心在中国发生的事件会危及美国人，现在看来，危机已经过去。
    今年69岁的恒安石从1981年到1985年担任驻中国大使。他在谈到美国政府对中国最近发生的事件应如何反应时说，“重要的一点是，不把自己置于一种覆水难收的地步”，“权衡得失是重要的”。
