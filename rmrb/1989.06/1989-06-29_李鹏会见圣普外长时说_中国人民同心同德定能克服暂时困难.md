Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 29th.

Li Peng, the Premier of the State Council, met with a delegation led by Carlos da Graça, the Foreign Minister of São Tomé and Príncipe, in the Zhongnanhai's Ziguangge this afternoon.

Li Peng, on behalf of the Chinese government, welcomed the first foreign minister to visit China after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

Li Peng told Carlos da Graça, "Your visit to China right after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion is a show of support for China."

He said, "China and São Tomé and Príncipe, along with other African countries, share common historical experiences. Now, we face the task of developing our economies and building our nations. Our shared destiny and aspirations bind us closely together."

Li Peng briefly introduced the situation in Beijing, from the student movement to the turmoil, and then to the counter-revolutionary rebellion, as well as the correct measures taken by the Party and the government to oppose the turmoil and suppress the rebellion.

He said, "Currently, many countries and individuals around the world have shown understanding and support for China's suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion. At the same time, China has also seen a wave of anti-China sentiment. They use the banner of human rights to unjustly criticize China's suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion and the legal punishment of criminals."

He said, "The Chinese government will not change its policies due to this incident. The Chinese government does not determine its policies based on temporary events, but rather from a correct analysis of the overall global situation and from the fundamental interests of the Chinese people, to formulate China's domestic and foreign policies."

Li Peng reiterated that China will firmly adhere to the socialist system, persist in reform and opening up, and maintain an independent and peaceful foreign policy.

He said, "Although China has encountered some temporary difficulties, I believe that under the leadership of the Party, the people of the entire nation, united as one, will definitely overcome these temporary difficulties."

Foreign Minister Carlos da Graça said that his visit to China was to express São Tomé and Príncipe's determination to strengthen friendly relations with China; to express his belief that the Chinese Party, government, and people have the right and ability to solve their own problems; and to express support for China's reform and opening up and its independent foreign policy.

　　李鹏会见圣普外长时说     
    中国人民同心同德定能克服暂时困难
    新华社北京６月２９日电  国务院总理李鹏今天下午在中南海紫光阁会见了圣多美和普林西比外交部长卡洛斯·达格拉萨一行。
    李鹏代表中国政府对在中国平息反革命暴乱后第一位来访的外国外长表示欢迎。
    李鹏对卡洛斯·达格拉萨说：“你在中国平息反革命暴乱之后来华访问，是对中国的支持。”
    他说，中国和圣多美和普林西比以及其它非洲国家有共同的历史遭遇，现在又面临发展经济和建设国家的任务。共同的命运和愿望把我们紧紧地联系在一起。
    李鹏向客人们简要介绍了在北京发生的由学潮到动乱、由动乱到反革命暴乱的情况及党和政府为反对动乱、平息暴乱所采取的正确措施。
    他说，现在世界上不少国家和人士对中国平息反革命暴乱采取了理解和支持的态度。与此同时，中国也看到，世界上也出现了一股反华逆流，他们打着人权的旗帜，对中国平息反革命暴乱，依法惩处犯罪分子进行无理指责。
    他说，中国政府不会因为这场风波而改变自己的政策。中国政府不是根据一时一事来确定自己的政策的，而是从对整个世界形势的正确分析和从中国人民的根本利益出发，来制定中国的内外政策的。
    李鹏重申，中国将坚定地坚持社会主义制度，坚持改革开放，坚持独立自主的和平外交政策。
    他说，虽然中国遇到了一些暂时的困难，但相信在党的领导下，全国人民同心同德，一定能克服这些暂时的困难。
    卡洛斯·达格拉萨外长说，他来中国访问是为了表达圣多美和普林西比决心加强同中国友好关系的愿望；表达相信中国党、政府和人民有权利、有能力解决自己的问题；表达对中国的改革开放和独立自主的外交政策的支持。
