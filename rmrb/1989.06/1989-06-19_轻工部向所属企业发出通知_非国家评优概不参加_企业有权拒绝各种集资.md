The Light Industry Department has issued a notice to its affiliated enterprises stating that they should only participate in state-level and provincial/municipal evaluations for excellent products, and that enterprises have the right to refuse various forms of fundraising.

According to a report, in response to the widespread "evaluation fever" driven by profit motives, the Light Industry Department recently issued a notice. It stated that in the future, all enterprises within the light industry system should only participate in evaluations for national, departmental, provincial, and municipal excellent products organized by the state and provinces/municipalities. All other evaluation activities, including various product exhibitions and quality tracking activities organized by other units, should not be participated in. Enterprises have the right to refuse various forms of fundraising.

The notice points out that according to the "Regulations on the Evaluation of National Excellent Products" approved by the State Council, except for evaluating excellent products in accordance with the regulations and the provisions of the State Council's competent departments or the people's governments of provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, no unit may confer the title of excellent product on industrial products.

The Light Industry Department also emphasized in the notice that during the participation in unified evaluations for national, departmental, provincial, and municipal excellent products, bribery, corruption, and falsification must be strictly prohibited.
