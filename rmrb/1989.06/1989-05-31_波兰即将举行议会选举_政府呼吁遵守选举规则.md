Poland is set to hold parliamentary elections, and the government has called on the Solidarity trade union and other constructive opposition groups to strictly adhere to election rules. This will ensure that the election campaign remains "honest, non-confrontational," and in line with the spirit of the Round Table Agreement.

The quadrennial parliamentary elections are scheduled for June 4. This year's elections will determine the composition of the new parliament and Senate, and a joint session of the parliament and Senate will elect the President of the Polish People's Republic.

Currently, various political parties, social organizations, and independent candidates are actively campaigning.

Rekowski stated that while every candidate naturally hopes to win, they should not resort to "any means necessary" or engage in "unscrupulous behavior."
