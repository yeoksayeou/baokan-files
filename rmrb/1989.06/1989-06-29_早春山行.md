Early Spring Mountain Walk
Xie Shu

In my decades-long career as a journalist, my footsteps have almost covered every mountain and river in Heilongjiang Province. Reflecting on it, as the relentless years pass, what remains in my memory?

Of course, I cannot forget the poetic and picturesque moon over Mirror Lake.

In the early 1960s, I and a photographer went to Mirror Lake for a special report. That day, our boat returned from the suspension bridge, and it was already dusk. At this time, the lake was vast and misty, with water vapor rising, and the mountains on both sides of the lake were shrouded in twilight, dark and solemn, giving a sense of solemnity and weight. Everyone fell silent, no longer chatting and laughing.

We walked quietly for a few miles. Suddenly, a flash of gold appeared before our eyes, as if the lake waves were gilded with the purest gold.

“Moonlight!” Someone joyfully exclaimed.

We looked at the lake again, and the shimmering gold light was spreading farther and farther. In an instant, the entire lake was golden and dazzling. What a bright autumn moon! As soon as it appeared, Mirror Lake in front of us became even more charming. The sparkling waves seemed to be her speaking eyes; the cool breeze seemed to be her even, fragrant breath. Because of the bright moon, she added many indescribable charms...

I also cannot forget the most fantastical scenery of the Heilongjiang River at dusk. In the early spring of 1984, I accompanied several writers from the upper reaches of the Heilongjiang River in Mohe to board a ship, sailing downstream to Heihe Town. That day, we boarded the ship at noon, and after settling down, the ship set off. Most of the writers were from the south, although they were used to seeing green mountains and waters, they had never sailed on a river that borders two countries, which naturally added to the novelty. After the ship sailed for a while, they were greatly surprised by the extraordinary scenery of the Heilongjiang River. What they saw was the deep blue and profound river water, the winding and distant green mountains; where the ship sailed, sometimes the river was wide, like a vast lake, sometimes the banks were steep, and the waterway was turbulent, like the Three Gorges. The river scenery changed constantly, and they were all stunned. When it was almost time for dinner, two of them wanted to go back to the cabin, but suddenly one of them pointed and shouted, “Look!” Following his pointing hand, we saw a round, orange-red setting sun hanging between the two mountains. At this time, the mountains on both sides were dark green, the river water was deep blue, and the setting sun was orange-red. These colors combined to create a magical, fairy-tale-like atmosphere; it could be said to be a magic palace or a fairyland. We were all mesmerized.

I especially cannot forget a philosophical early spring mountain walk.

In the early spring of 1962, that mountain walk gave me the opportunity to fully appreciate the vast and majestic scenery and the charming green beauty of the Xing'an Mountains.

A publicity officer from the Forestry Bureau accompanied me. We walked through the snow-covered mountains, chatting as we went. I suddenly had an idea and curiously asked him, “What flower blooms to announce the arrival of spring in the Xing'an Mountains?”

He replied without hesitation, “Of course, it’s the ice flower!”

I had never seen this flower and asked, “Why is it called an ice flower?”

“Because it blooms through the ice and snow!” He looked at my curious expression and said, “Let me find it for you!”

So, I followed him as he searched.

Suddenly, he listened carefully and asked me, “Do you hear it?”

I didn’t understand his meaning and shook my head in confusion.

He didn’t ask me again but continued to search ahead. After walking about a dozen steps, he shouted, “Found it!”

I rushed over in a few steps and looked, only to be greatly disappointed. There was no ice flower, but a stream just thawing under the ice and snow, bubbling.

Seeing my disappointment, he smiled and said, “You don’t know, when the stream thaws, the grass wakes up, and the trees come to life. There must be ice flowers here.”

Indeed, nearby we found a small plant with a stem about two inches long and small yellow flowers on top.

He pointed to this pitifully thin plant and said, “This is the ice flower!”

I widened my eyes in amazement and squatted down to take a closer look. Ah! Its stem was so thin, like transparent bean sprouts, and the flowers were so delicate, as if they would melt with a single breath. Yet, it was indeed standing proudly on the snow-covered mountain. I was astonished and said, “I can’t believe it’s so thin!”

Walking on the road, I kept thinking: In nature, why do some things that appear strong and robust not withstand the wind and frost, perishing in an instant; while those that are frail and thin can break through the frozen soil and bravely resist the ice and snow?

Perhaps solving this can reveal a philosophy. I thought.

　　早春山行
    谢树
    在我几十年的记者生涯中，足迹几乎踏遍黑龙江省的山山水水。细想一想，随着无情岁月的流逝，在记忆里还留下了些什么？
    当然，我忘不了那极富诗情画意的镜泊赏月。
    ６０年代初，我和一位摄影记者到镜泊湖去作专题采访。那天，我们的游船从吊水楼子回来，已经是暮色苍茫了。这时，镜泊湖上烟波浩渺，水气浮生，湖两岸的群山披着暮霭，苍黛沉郁，给人一种肃穆而凝重的感觉。大家都沉默下来，不再纵谈嬉笑。
    这样静静地走了几里水程。忽然，我们的眼前金光一闪，就像用最纯的金子镀亮了湖波。
    “月亮！”不知谁快乐地呼喊起来。
    我们再向湖中看，粼粼金光正越镀越远，一时间，满湖金灿，耀眼生辉。好一轮皎洁的秋月！她一照临，我们眼前的镜泊湖便更加妩媚多姿了。光闪闪欲语不语的流波，好像是她会说话的眼睛；凉习习欲走不走的清风，好像是她那均匀香馥的呼吸。她因了明月，竟平添了许多令人难言的蜿约之美……
    我也忘不了最富奇幻色彩的龙江晚眺。１９８４年早春，我陪几位作家自黑龙江最上游的漠河登轮，一路顺水，下放黑河镇。那天上船是中午，安顿好之后，船便开了。几位作家多是南方人，虽然看惯了青山绿水，却未航行过两国的界江，这自然增加了新奇感。及至船行一段水程之后，他们又为黑龙江上不凡的景色大大惊讶了。他们看到的是碧蓝而深沉的江水，曲折婉蜒、时远时近的青山；船行处，有时江面宽阔，酷似烟波浩渺的大湖，有时两岸削壁、水道湍急，又极像三峡。江景变幻，不时而异，把他们几位都看呆了。快吃晚饭时，有两位要回舱去了，忽然其中一位用手一指大喊一声：“快看！”大家随着他的手指看去，两岸山夹峙处，悬着一轮橙红色的浑圆落日。这时，两岸的山是黛绿色，江水是深蓝色，落日是橙红色，这几种颜色配搭在一起，产生了一种奇妙的童话般的意境；可以说那是魔宫，也可以说是仙境。我们都被痴痴地迷住了。
    我更忘不了一次颇有哲理启迪的早春山行。
    １９６２年早春的那次山行，使我有机会饱览了小兴安岭里莽莽苍苍的浑博气象和老绿如黛的动人秀色。
    林业局的一位宣传干事陪我同行。我俩踏着漫山积雪，边走边唠。我灵机一动，好奇地向他提出了一个问题：“什么花来为小兴安岭报春？”
    他不假思索地回答：“当然是冰凌花！”
    我没见过这种花，问：“为啥叫冰凌花？”
    “因为它是顶着冰雪开花的！”他望着我好奇的神色说，“我给你找找看！”
    于是，我跟着他边走边找。
    忽然，他侧起耳朵仔细听，并且问我：“听见了吗？”
    我弄不清他这话的意思，茫然地摇了摇头。
    他不再问我，探寻着向前走去。走出十几步，他喊叫起来：“找到了！”
    我三脚两步奔过去，一看，不禁大失所望，哪里有什么冰凌花，却是冰雪覆盖下一条刚刚解冻的山溪在汩汩地流淌。
    他见我失望的样子，笑着说：“你不晓得，山溪解冻，草苏树醒。这一片准有冰凌花。”
    果然，在附近我们找到一棵二寸多长的细茎、顶端开着小黄花的细嫩植物。
    他指着这瘦得可怜的小植物说：“这就是冰凌花！”
    我顿时瞪大了眼睛，蹲下身去仔细看。啊！它的枝茎竟是那么纤细，就像透明的豆芽菜，花朵又是那么单薄，仿佛呵一口气就会融化。然而，千真万确地就是它傲然挺立在积着冰雪的山地上。我大为惊诧地说：“真不敢相信，它竟是这么纤细！”
    走在路上，我边走边想：在自然界，为什么有些看上去粗壮遒劲的竟不胜风霜，毁于旦夕；而那些伶仃纤细的却能力破冻土，勇抗冰雪？
    也许，解开它能得到一条哲理。我这样想。
