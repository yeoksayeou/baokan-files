Guangzhou handles a traffic obstruction incident

New China News Agency, Guangzhou, June 7th: According to the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau, at around 4 AM today, Guangzhou public security officers and armed police together took measures to handle a group of people obstructing traffic on the Haizhu Bridge.

On the afternoon of June 6th, around 4 PM, a group of people using the "Guangzhou Workers" banner blocked vehicles on the Haizhu Bridge, a major traffic artery in Guangzhou, and forcibly solicited donations from passing pedestrians. This attracted thousands of onlookers and caused thousands of vehicles to be unable to pass. Starting at midnight on the 7th, some of these people went to nearby areas along the river and Yide Road, using wooden sticks to smash the doors and windows of four shops, harassing multiple young women, and looting watermelons from a car.

At around 4 AM today, more than 600 public security officers and armed police from the Guangzhou Public Security Bureau and the armed police force jointly encircled and processed this group of people. The so-called "Guangzhou Workers" did not resist. The public security bureau interrogated 129 people, of whom 42 were from Guangzhou, none of whom were industrial workers or students. The remaining 87 people were from other provinces and regions. Among the 60 people detained for interrogation, most were criminals who had migrated from other provinces and regions to Guangzhou. There were 4 people who had been released from reform through labor or re-education through labor, and 1 person who was being pursued for fraud.
