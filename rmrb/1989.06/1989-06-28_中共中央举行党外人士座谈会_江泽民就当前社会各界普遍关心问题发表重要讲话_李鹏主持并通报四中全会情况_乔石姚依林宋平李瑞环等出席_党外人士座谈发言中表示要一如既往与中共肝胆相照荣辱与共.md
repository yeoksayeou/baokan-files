Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 28th. The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Jiang Zemin, said today that the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee was held smoothly and successfully. This not only has a significant impact on further stabilizing the situation across the country but will also have a profound influence on ensuring the continuity of the Party's line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee. The plenary session clearly outlined four major tasks for the coming period, which we must work together to accomplish.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a symposium with non-party personnel in the Huairen Hall of Zhongnanhai this afternoon. The Standing Committee members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, and Li Ruihuan, attended the symposium. Li Peng presided over the meeting and reported on the situation of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee to the non-party personnel.

Jiang Zemin spoke at the symposium about issues of widespread concern in society. He said that the work of thoroughly suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion and stopping the turmoil must be both decisive and swift, while strictly distinguishing between different types of contradictions. We must resolutely investigate and punish the plotters, organizers, and masterminds behind the rebellion and turmoil, as well as the core members of illegal organizations and those who committed serious crimes such as arson, looting, and killing. If we allow them to go unpunished, it will lead to endless troubles and no peace for the country or the people. We must not show even one percent of leniency towards these ruthless enemies; otherwise, we will commit a historical mistake. On the other hand, in this struggle, we must strictly distinguish between different types of contradictions, strictly implement policies, and strictly act according to the law. For those who were misled and participated in marches, support, and hunger strikes, especially young students, the main issue is education. We must help them summarize their experiences and learn from their mistakes to win over and unite with the broad masses of people, isolating and striking at a small number of bad elements.

We must seriously carry out education and struggle to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization, and we must persist in this for a long time. The struggle against liberalization will not change the Party's policy towards intellectuals, nor will it change the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend."

Jiang Zemin said that we must continue to focus on economic construction and improve economic work. Currently, all levels of leadership must focus on both thoroughly suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion and stabilizing the situation, as well as economic construction. We must avoid economic decline and strive to maintain a reasonable and achievable development speed. Various measures for rectification and deepening reform in the economic field must continue to be implemented. For weak links that seriously constrain economic development, such as basic industries, transportation, and agriculture, we must continue to take effective measures to strengthen them. We must continue to pay attention to science and technology and education. We must continue to focus on and improve economic work, and make up for the losses caused by the turmoil and rebellion. In this regard, we must especially strive to improve economic efficiency, leverage the role of large and medium-sized enterprises as the backbone of the national economy, and leverage the role of the working class as the main force, using the facts of continuous, stable, and coordinated economic development to completely shatter the dreams of the plotters and masterminds behind the scenes who want to reverse the verdict and restore the old system.

Jiang Zemin pointed out that we must continue to adhere to the policy of reform and opening up. Reform and opening up have been implemented in our country for ten years. Our country, our workers, peasants, intellectuals, and other laborers have all benefited from this policy. Why should we withdraw a policy that is supported by the vast majority of the people? Of course, our reform and opening up are reforms and opening up that adhere to the socialist direction, which are completely different from the "reform and opening up" advocated by those who stubbornly pursue bourgeois liberalization with capitalistization as the center. Here, I want to solemnly declare to the comrades and friends present, as well as to all those at home and abroad who care about China's development: the general policy and general direction of China's reform and opening up will not change; not only will it not change, but we will also better and more effectively adhere to reform and opening up, making this great cause advance more steadily, better, and even faster. It is true that after this turmoil and rebellion, we indeed need to seriously summarize our experiences, persist in the correct parts, correct the mistaken parts, and strengthen the weak parts, all for the purpose of better promoting reform and opening up!

Jiang Zemin emphasized that we must continue to adhere to the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party, and better utilize the role of the People's Political Consultative Conference, various democratic parties, and people's organizations in the political life of the state. Everyone knows that Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always advocated better utilizing the role of democratic party members in political participation and supervision. This is an important part of our political system reform. We must continue to provide conditions for democratic parties to participate in politics and supervision. We hope that various democratic parties will continue to assist our Party and government in correcting mistakes, eliminating corruption, and mobilizing the socialist enthusiasm of people from all walks of life. In the process of stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, members of various democratic parties and non-party democrats, in general, have considered the overall situation. Many comrades and friends have done a lot of work in difficult situations, playing an active role in stabilizing the situation. "True friends are known in times of adversity." In this struggle, due to the complex situation and the process of the event's evolution and complete exposure, some non-party friends, due to not fully understanding the situation at the time, had various doubts and views, which is understandable. After further understanding the facts and studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech, everyone's doubts gradually disappeared, and their understanding gradually unified, which is very gratifying. Through this event, it is proven that the cooperative relationship between our Party and various democratic parties and non-party democrats has a solid foundation, can withstand tests, and has a broad future.

He said that in the future, our Party will continue to expand the united front. The communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session pointed out that the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee will not change. The "not change" here includes our various principles related to the united front not changing, the principle of "one country, two systems" not changing, the principles towards Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao not changing, and the established national policies, religious policies, and policies towards overseas Chinese also not changing.

Jiang Zemin finally pointed out that the domestic and international reactions to the Fourth Plenary Session are good. The situation in Beijing and other places continues to develop towards stability. At the same time, we are also soberly aware that the Party and government still face many problems and difficulties, especially the arduous tasks of stabilizing the situation, developing the economy, punishing corruption, and unifying ideological understanding. We hope that the comrades and friends present will continue to make their respective contributions to achieving a complete victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, promoting reform and opening up, and strengthening democratic and legal construction.

At the symposium, Zhu Lianfen, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang; Fei Xiaotong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League; Sun Qimeng, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic Construction Association; Lei Jieqiong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association; Fang Rongxin, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association (representing Chairman Lu Jishi); Dong Yincheng, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party; Sun Chengpei, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League (representing Chairman Zhou Peiyuan); Cai Zimin, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League; non-party personage Cheng Siyuan; Rong Yiren, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce; and ethnic minority representative Apu Awang Jinmei spoke at the symposium.

They believed that the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee was held at a very timely and successful moment, with significant practical significance and far-reaching historical influence. They expressed their complete support for Comrade Jiang Zemin as the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, their complete support for the handling of Comrade Zhao Ziyang's mistakes, and their complete support for the adjustments made by the plenary session to part of the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

They pointed out that the Fourth Plenary Session clearly declared that the people of the whole country must continue to resolutely implement the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, and continue to resolutely implement the basic line of "one center, two basic points" of the Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. We firmly support this. Practice has proven that without the Communist Party, there would be no New China, and without adhering to the socialist road, China would have no way out. The Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the state, and reform and opening up are the path to strength. We must persist in this.

In their speeches, they also mentioned that Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out that the work of thoroughly suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion and stopping the turmoil must be both decisive and swift, while strictly distinguishing between different types of contradictions, which is very correct.

They expressed that in the future, they will continue to unite closely around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, share joys and sorrows with the Communist Party of China, and work together to achieve greater victories in China's socialist modernization construction.

The alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Secretary of the Secretariat, Ding Guan'gen; the alternate member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Wen Jiabao; and the Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Yan Mingfu, also attended the symposium.

The leaders of the Central Committees of various democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, non-party democrats, ethnic minorities, and religious representatives who attended the symposium included: Qu Wu, Zheng Dongguo, Jia Yibin, Hou Jingru, Peng Qingyuan, Li Ganliu, He Luli, Li Peiyao, Sun Yueqi, Qian Weichang, Gao Tian, Ye Duyi, Tao Dazong, Luo Hanshun, Ma Dayou, Feng Zhiyun, Ding Shisun, Wu Xiuping, Wan Guangquan, Feng Tiyun, Huang Danna, Bai Dahua, Feng Kehu, Sun Xiaocun, Chen Shungli, Ge Zhicheng, Chu Zhuang, Ye Zhishan, Mei Xiangming, Chen Nanshan, Chen Yiqun, Yao Jun, Zhang Shimin, Tian Guangtao, Shen Qizhen, Huang Dingchen, Yang Jike, Lu Rongshu, Wang Songda, Yan Jizi, Xu Caideng, Hao Yipu, Chen Mingshao, Zhao Weizhi, Wang Gengchang, Lin Shengzhong, Wu Ketao, Chen Zhongyi, Wu Guozhen, Pan Yuanying, Ma Yi, Ye Baoshan, Jing Shuping, Huang Liangchen, Hu Dingyi, Li Tieqing.

    新华社北京６月２８日电　中共中央总书记江泽民今天说，党的十三届四中全会开得很顺利、很成功。这不仅对于当前进一步稳定全国局势具有重大作用，而且对于今后保证十一届三中全会以来我们党的路线、方针、政策的连续性，必将产生深远的影响。全会明确提出了今后一个时期要抓好的四件大事，我们要共同努力，把这四件事情做好。
    中共中央今天下午在中南海怀仁堂召开了党外人士座谈会。中共中央政治局常委江泽民、李鹏、乔石、姚依林、宋平、李瑞环出席座谈会。李鹏同志主持会议并向党外人士通报了中共十三届四中全会的情况。
    江泽民同志在座谈会上就当前社会各界普遍关心的问题发表了重要讲话。他说，彻底平息反革命暴乱和制止动乱的工作，既要坚决、抓紧，又要严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。我们要下决心把那些制造暴乱、动乱的策划者、组织者和幕后指挥者，各种非法组织的骨干分子和进行打、砸、抢、烧、杀等严重危害社会治安的犯罪分子，彻底清查出来，及时依法从严惩处。如果让他们逍遥法外，必将后患无穷，国无宁日，民无宁日。对这些凶残的敌人，连百分之一的原谅都不应有，如果手软，那就会犯历史性的错误。另一方面，在这场斗争中，我们又必须严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，严格执行政策，严格依法办事。对于一时不明真相，参加过游行、声援、绝食的群众，特别是青年学生，主要是教育问题，要热情帮助他们总结经验、吸取教训，以利于最大限度地争取和团结广大群众，孤立和打击极少数坏人。
    我们必须认真开展坚持四项基本原则、反对资产阶级自由化的教育和斗争，并且长期坚持下去，决不走过场或半途而废。反对自由化的斗争，绝不会改变党的知识分子政策，绝不会改变党的“百花齐放、百家争鸣”的方针。
    江泽民说，要继续坚持以经济建设为中心，搞好经济工作。当前，各级领导要一手抓彻底平息反革命暴乱和稳定局势的工作，一手抓经济建设。经济要避免滑坡，努力保持一个合理的切实可行的发展速度。经济领域治理整顿和深化改革的各项措施都要继续抓紧落实。对基础工业、交通运输、农业等严重制约经济发展的薄弱环节，都要继续采取得力措施予以加强。要继续重视科技和教育事业。我们务必要继续聚精会神把经济工作抓紧、抓好，把动乱、暴乱造成的损失夺回来。在这方面，我们要特别注意努力提高经济效益，发挥大中型企业在国民经济中的骨干作用，发挥工人阶级主力军的作用，用经济持续、稳定、协调发展的事实彻底粉碎那些幕后策划者、指挥者翻案、复辟的梦想。
    江泽民指出，要继续坚持改革开放。改革开放在我国已经实行了十年。我们的国家，我们的工人、农民、知识分子和其它劳动者，都从这个政策中得到了利益。一个受到全国广大人民群众拥护的政策，有什么理由收回去呢？当然，我们的改革开放是坚持社会主义方向的改革开放，同那些顽固搞资产阶级自由化的人所主张的以资本主义化为中心的“改革开放”是迥然不同的。我在这里愿意向在座的同志们、朋友们，也向国内外所有关心中国发展的人们负责地申明：中国改革开放的总方针和总政策决不会变；不仅不会变，而且要更好、更有效地坚持地改革开放，使这一伟大事业前进得更稳、更好甚至更快。不错，经过这次动乱和暴乱，我们确实需要认真总结经验，坚持正确的部分，纠正失误的部分，加强不足的部分，目的是为了把改革开放更好地推向前进！
    江泽民强调，要继续坚持共产党领导的多党合作制和政治协商制度，更好地发挥人民政协、各民主党派、各人民团体在国家政治生活中的作用。大家知道，邓小平同志一直主张更好地发挥民主党派成员的参政和监督作用。这是我国政治体制改革的一项重要内容。要继续为民主党派参政议政和实行民主监督进一步提供条件。希望各民主党派继续协助我们党和政府纠正工作中的失误，消除腐败，调动各界人士的社会主义积极性。在这次制止动乱和平息反革命暴乱的过程中，各民主党派成员和无党派民主人士，从总体上来说，是顾全大局的。许多同志、朋友在困难的情况下做了大量工作，对稳定局势起了积极作用。“疾风知劲草，患难见人心”。在这场斗争中，由于情况相当复杂，事件也有个演变和彻底暴露的过程，有些党外朋友由于一时对情况不够了解，曾经有过这样那样的疑虑和看法，这也是可以理解的。在经过对事实真象的进一步了解和学习了邓小平同志的讲话之后，大家的疑虑逐步消除了，认识逐步统一了，这是十分可喜的。通过这次事件，证明我们党同各民主党派和无党派民主人士的合作关系，基础是牢固的，是经得起考验的，前景也是广阔的。
    他说，今后，我们党将继续坚持和扩大爱国统一战线。四中全会公报指出，十一届三中全会以来的路线方针政策不变。这里所说的不变，包括我们的有关统一战线的各项方针不变，“一国两制”的方针不变，对台湾、香港、澳门的方针不变，既定的民族政策、宗教政策、侨务政策也不变。
    江泽民最后指出，国内国外对四中全会的反应是好的。北京和各地的形势继续向稳定的方向发展。同时，我们也清醒地看到，党和政府面临的问题和困难还不少，特别是稳定局势、发展经济、惩治腐败以及统一思想认识等任务还相当艰巨。希望在座各位同志、朋友为夺取平息反革命暴乱的彻底胜利，推进改革开放，加强民主和法制建设，继续作出各自应有的贡献。
    在座谈会上，民革中央主席朱学范、民盟中央主席费孝通、民建中央主席孙起孟、民进中央主席雷洁琼、农工党中央常务副主席方荣欣（代表卢嘉锡主席）、致公党中央主席董寅初、九三学社中央常务副主席孙承佩（代表周培源主席）、台盟中央主席团主席蔡子民、无党派人士程思远、全国工商联主席荣毅仁、少数民族代表阿沛·阿旺晋美在座谈会上发了言。
    他们在发言中认为，中共十三届四中全会开得非常及时，非常成功，具有重大的现实意义和深远的历史影响。他们表示完全拥护江泽民同志为中共中央总书记，完全拥护对赵紫阳同志所犯错误的处理决定，完全拥护全会对中共中央领导机构部分成员进行调整的决定。
    他们指出，四中全会明确宣告全国人民要继续坚决执行中共十一届三中全会以来的路线、方针和政策，继续坚决执行中共十三大“一个中心、两个基本点”的基本路线，我们坚决拥护。实践证明，没有共产党，就没有新中国，不坚持社会主义道路，中国就没有出路。四项基本原则是立国之本，改革开放是强国之路，我们一定要坚持下去。
    他们在发言中还谈到，江泽民总书记指出，彻底平息反革命暴乱和制止动乱的工作，既要坚决、抓紧，又要严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，这是非常正确的。
    他们表示，今后将一如既往，紧密团结在中共中央周围，和中国共产党肝胆相照、荣辱与共，齐心协力，为夺取我国社会主义现代化建设事业的更大胜利共同奋斗。
    中共中央政治局候补委员、书记处书记丁关根，中共中央书记处候补书记温家宝，中共中央统战部部长阎明复，也出席了座谈会。
    出席座谈会的各民主党派中央、全国工商联领导同志和无党派人士、少数民族及宗教界代表人士还有：屈武、郑洞国、贾亦斌、侯镜如、彭清源、李赣骝、何鲁丽、李沛瑶、孙越崎、钱伟长、高天、叶笃义、陶大镛、罗涵先、马大猷、冯之浚、丁石孙、吴修平、万国权、冯梯云、黄大能、白大华、冯克煦、孙晓村、陈舜礼、葛志成、楚庄、叶至善、梅向明、陈难先、陈益群、姚峻、章师明、田光涛、沈其震、黄鼎臣、杨纪珂、陆榕树、王宋大、严济慈、徐采栋、郝诒纯、陈明绍、赵伟之、王淦昌、林盛中、吴克泰、陈仲颐、吴国祯、潘渊静、马仪、叶宝珊、经叔平、黄凉尘、胡定一、李铁铮。
