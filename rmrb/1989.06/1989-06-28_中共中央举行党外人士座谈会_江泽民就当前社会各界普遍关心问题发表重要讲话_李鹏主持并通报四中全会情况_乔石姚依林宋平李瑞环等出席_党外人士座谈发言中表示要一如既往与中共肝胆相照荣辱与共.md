Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 28th. The General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Jiang Zemin, said today that the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee was held smoothly and successfully. This not only has a significant impact on further stabilizing the situation across the country but will also have a profound influence on ensuring the continuity of the Party's line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee. The plenary session clearly outlined four major tasks for the coming period, which we must work together to accomplish.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China held a symposium with non-party personnel in the Huairen Hall of Zhongnanhai this afternoon. The Standing Committee members of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee, Jiang Zemin, Li Peng, Qiao Shi, Yao Yilin, Song Ping, and Li Ruihuan, attended the symposium. Li Peng presided over the meeting and reported on the situation of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee to the non-party personnel.

Jiang Zemin spoke at the symposium about issues of widespread concern in society. He said that the work of thoroughly suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion and stopping the turmoil must be both decisive and swift, while strictly distinguishing between different types of contradictions. We must resolutely investigate and punish the plotters, organizers, and masterminds behind the rebellion and turmoil, as well as the core members of illegal organizations and those who committed serious crimes such as arson, looting, and killing. If we allow them to go unpunished, it will lead to endless troubles and no peace for the country or the people. We must not show even one percent of leniency towards these ruthless enemies; otherwise, we will commit a historical mistake. On the other hand, in this struggle, we must strictly distinguish between different types of contradictions, strictly implement policies, and strictly act according to the law. For those who were misled and participated in marches, support, and hunger strikes, especially young students, the main issue is education. We must help them summarize their experiences and learn from their mistakes to win over and unite with the broad masses of people, isolating and striking at a small number of bad elements.

We must seriously carry out education and struggle to uphold the Four Cardinal Principles and oppose bourgeois liberalization, and we must persist in this for a long time. The struggle against liberalization will not change the Party's policy towards intellectuals, nor will it change the Party's policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend."

Jiang Zemin said that we must continue to focus on economic construction and improve economic work. Currently, all levels of leadership must focus on both thoroughly suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion and stabilizing the situation, as well as economic construction. We must avoid economic decline and strive to maintain a reasonable and achievable development speed. Various measures for rectification and deepening reform in the economic field must continue to be implemented. For weak links that seriously constrain economic development, such as basic industries, transportation, and agriculture, we must continue to take effective measures to strengthen them. We must continue to pay attention to science and technology and education. We must continue to focus on and improve economic work, and make up for the losses caused by the turmoil and rebellion. In this regard, we must especially strive to improve economic efficiency, leverage the role of large and medium-sized enterprises as the backbone of the national economy, and leverage the role of the working class as the main force, using the facts of continuous, stable, and coordinated economic development to completely shatter the dreams of the plotters and masterminds behind the scenes who want to reverse the verdict and restore the old system.

Jiang Zemin pointed out that we must continue to adhere to the policy of reform and opening up. Reform and opening up have been implemented in our country for ten years. Our country, our workers, peasants, intellectuals, and other laborers have all benefited from this policy. Why should we withdraw a policy that is supported by the vast majority of the people? Of course, our reform and opening up are reforms and opening up that adhere to the socialist direction, which are completely different from the "reform and opening up" advocated by those who stubbornly pursue bourgeois liberalization with capitalistization as the center. Here, I want to solemnly declare to the comrades and friends present, as well as to all those at home and abroad who care about China's development: the general policy and general direction of China's reform and opening up will not change; not only will it not change, but we will also better and more effectively adhere to reform and opening up, making this great cause advance more steadily, better, and even faster. It is true that after this turmoil and rebellion, we indeed need to seriously summarize our experiences, persist in the correct parts, correct the mistaken parts, and strengthen the weak parts, all for the purpose of better promoting reform and opening up!

Jiang Zemin emphasized that we must continue to adhere to the system of multi-party cooperation and political consultation under the leadership of the Communist Party, and better utilize the role of the People's Political Consultative Conference, various democratic parties, and people's organizations in the political life of the state. Everyone knows that Comrade Deng Xiaoping has always advocated better utilizing the role of democratic party members in political participation and supervision. This is an important part of our political system reform. We must continue to provide conditions for democratic parties to participate in politics and supervision. We hope that various democratic parties will continue to assist our Party and government in correcting mistakes, eliminating corruption, and mobilizing the socialist enthusiasm of people from all walks of life. In the process of stopping the turmoil and suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, members of various democratic parties and non-party democrats, in general, have considered the overall situation. Many comrades and friends have done a lot of work in difficult situations, playing an active role in stabilizing the situation. "True friends are known in times of adversity." In this struggle, due to the complex situation and the process of the event's evolution and complete exposure, some non-party friends, due to not fully understanding the situation at the time, had various doubts and views, which is understandable. After further understanding the facts and studying Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech, everyone's doubts gradually disappeared, and their understanding gradually unified, which is very gratifying. Through this event, it is proven that the cooperative relationship between our Party and various democratic parties and non-party democrats has a solid foundation, can withstand tests, and has a broad future.

He said that in the future, our Party will continue to expand the united front. The communiqu√© of the Fourth Plenary Session pointed out that the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee will not change. The "not change" here includes our various principles related to the united front not changing, the principle of "one country, two systems" not changing, the principles towards Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Macao not changing, and the established national policies, religious policies, and policies towards overseas Chinese also not changing.

Jiang Zemin finally pointed out that the domestic and international reactions to the Fourth Plenary Session are good. The situation in Beijing and other places continues to develop towards stability. At the same time, we are also soberly aware that the Party and government still face many problems and difficulties, especially the arduous tasks of stabilizing the situation, developing the economy, punishing corruption, and unifying ideological understanding. We hope that the comrades and friends present will continue to make their respective contributions to achieving a complete victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, promoting reform and opening up, and strengthening democratic and legal construction.

At the symposium, Zhu Lianfen, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang; Fei Xiaotong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League; Sun Qimeng, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic Construction Association; Lei Jieqiong, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association; Fang Rongxin, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association (representing Chairman Lu Jishi); Dong Yincheng, Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party; Sun Chengpei, Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League (representing Chairman Zhou Peiyuan); Cai Zimin, Chairman of the Central Committee of the Taiwan Democratic Self-Government League; non-party personage Cheng Siyuan; Rong Yiren, Chairman of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce; and ethnic minority representative Apu Awang Jinmei spoke at the symposium.

They believed that the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee was held at a very timely and successful moment, with significant practical significance and far-reaching historical influence. They expressed their complete support for Comrade Jiang Zemin as the General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, their complete support for the handling of Comrade Zhao Ziyang's mistakes, and their complete support for the adjustments made by the plenary session to part of the leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

They pointed out that the Fourth Plenary Session clearly declared that the people of the whole country must continue to resolutely implement the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, and continue to resolutely implement the basic line of "one center, two basic points" of the Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China. We firmly support this. Practice has proven that without the Communist Party, there would be no New China, and without adhering to the socialist road, China would have no way out. The Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the state, and reform and opening up are the path to strength. We must persist in this.

In their speeches, they also mentioned that Comrade Jiang Zemin pointed out that the work of thoroughly suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion and stopping the turmoil must be both decisive and swift, while strictly distinguishing between different types of contradictions, which is very correct.

They expressed that in the future, they will continue to unite closely around the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, share joys and sorrows with the Communist Party of China, and work together to achieve greater victories in China's socialist modernization construction.

The alternate member of the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Secretary of the Secretariat, Ding Guan'gen; the alternate member of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Wen Jiabao; and the Minister of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Yan Mingfu, also attended the symposium.

The leaders of the Central Committees of various democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, non-party democrats, ethnic minorities, and religious representatives who attended the symposium included: Qu Wu, Zheng Dongguo, Jia Yibin, Hou Jingru, Peng Qingyuan, Li Ganliu, He Luli, Li Peiyao, Sun Yueqi, Qian Weichang, Gao Tian, Ye Duyi, Tao Dazong, Luo Hanshun, Ma Dayou, Feng Zhiyun, Ding Shisun, Wu Xiuping, Wan Guangquan, Feng Tiyun, Huang Danna, Bai Dahua, Feng Kehu, Sun Xiaocun, Chen Shungli, Ge Zhicheng, Chu Zhuang, Ye Zhishan, Mei Xiangming, Chen Nanshan, Chen Yiqun, Yao Jun, Zhang Shimin, Tian Guangtao, Shen Qizhen, Huang Dingchen, Yang Jike, Lu Rongshu, Wang Songda, Yan Jizi, Xu Caideng, Hao Yipu, Chen Mingshao, Zhao Weizhi, Wang Gengchang, Lin Shengzhong, Wu Ketao, Chen Zhongyi, Wu Guozhen, Pan Yuanying, Ma Yi, Ye Baoshan, Jing Shuping, Huang Liangchen, Hu Dingyi, Li Tieqing.

The responsible comrades of the United Front Work Department of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Li Ding, Wan Shaofen, Wu Lianyuan, and Song Kun, also attended the symposium.
