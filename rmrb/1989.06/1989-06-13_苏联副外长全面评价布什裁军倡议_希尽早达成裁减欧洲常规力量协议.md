Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Evaluates Bush's Disarmament Initiative
Hopes for Early Agreement on Reducing Conventional Forces in Europe

WASHINGTON, June 12 (Xinhua) — Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Viktor Karpov today published an article in The New York Times, providing a comprehensive evaluation of President Bush's disarmament proposals made at the NATO summit. He expressed the hope that an agreement on reducing conventional forces in Europe could be reached as soon as possible.

Karpov believes that Bush's initiative is a response to the Soviet Union's proposals and is the result of the Bush administration's analysis of military strategy and political-military issues. The Soviet Union hopes that the United States will also respond similarly in areas such as reducing offensive strategic weapons, promoting space weapons negotiations, and adhering to the anti-ballistic missile treaty.

Karpov said that with regard to conventional forces, a unique situation has emerged that allows the parties involved in the Vienna negotiations to bring their positions closer together and reach an agreement within a shorter time frame to begin reducing military forces from the Atlantic to the Urals. He mentioned that there are common points and differences between the two sides. The Warsaw Pact and Bush's proposed reduction levels for tanks and armored vehicles are the same, and the reduction levels for artillery and helicopters are very close, making it possible to reach an agreement soon in these areas. However, the issue of reducing the number of aircraft is complex. The Soviet Union believes it is unreasonable for the United States to include purely defensive interceptors in the reduction.

Karpov also noted that Bush's proposal only discusses the reduction of U.S. and Soviet troops stationed abroad, without mentioning the troops of Britain, France, Belgium, and Canada, thus ignoring the balance of forces between the two blocs.

Karpov further believes that the U.S. initiative did not formally respond to the negotiations on short-range tactical nuclear weapons, which is a serious shortcoming. He said the Soviet Union advocates for a parallel solution to conventional and tactical nuclear forces in Europe to ensure that the Warsaw Pact and NATO rebuild their military forces on a purely defensive basis.

### 苏联副外长全面评价布什裁军倡议  希尽早达成裁减欧洲常规力量协议

　　苏联副外长全面评价布什裁军倡议
    希尽早达成裁减欧洲常规力量协议
    本报华盛顿６月１２日电  苏联外交部副部长维克多·卡尔波夫今天在《纽约时报》发表文章，全面评价布什总统在北约会议上提出的裁军倡议，希望尽早达成一项裁减欧洲常规力量的协议。
    卡尔波夫认为，布什总统的倡议是对苏联提出的建议的响应，也是布什政府对军事战略和政治军事问题进行分析的结果。苏联希望美国在削减进攻性战略武器等领域也能作出同样的响应，以推动太空武器谈判，遵守反导弹条约。
    卡尔波夫说，就常规力量而言，现在出现了一种特有的情况，能使有关各方在维也纳谈判中的立场更加接近，同时使他们在较短的时间内达成协议并开始削减从大西洋到乌拉尔的军事力量。他在谈到双方的共同点和分歧点时说，华约和布什提出的坦克和装甲车的削减水平相同，火炮和直升机的削减水平很接近，在这些方面可望早日达成协议。但在削减飞机数量方面问题复杂，苏联认为美国把纯属防御的截击机包括在削减之列是不合理的。卡尔波夫还说，布什的建议只谈美苏驻国外军队的削减，而未提及英、法、比利时和加拿大的驻外军队，忽略了两个集团的力量平衡。
    卡尔波夫还认为，美国在倡议中未对举行短程战术核武器谈判作出正式响应，是个严重的不足。他说苏联主张对欧洲的常规力量和战术核力量平行解决，以保证华约和北约在单纯防御的基础上重建它们的军事力量。
