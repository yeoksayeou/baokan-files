At around 6 PM on June 25, 200,000 people from various sectors of Pyongyang gathered in Kim Il-sung Square and major streets in the city center for a massive anti-American rally and demonstration. During the two-hour event, the crowd repeatedly chanted slogans condemning the continued presence of U.S. troops in South Korea, expressing the strong anti-American sentiments of the North Korean people.

June 25 is a day that North Koreans will never forget. On this day 39 years ago, the United States and the South Korean government of Syngman Rhee suddenly launched the Korean War. This imposed a grueling and arduous war on the North Korean people. The Chinese people, whose national security was seriously threatened, had no choice but to send their finest sons and daughters to defend their homeland, making tremendous sacrifices. During the three-year war, the young Democratic People's Republic of Korea suffered severe destruction in both urban and rural areas, with tens of thousands of people killed and many families separated. Even 30 years later, many families remain divided.

The lessons of the three-year war and the reality of continued U.S. hostility towards the Democratic People's Republic of Korea have made the North Korean people realize that the United States is the mastermind behind the disruption of peace on the Korean Peninsula and the obstruction of Korean reunification. Therefore, the North Korean government has designated June 25 to July 27 as "Anti-American Struggle Month." Every year around June 25, Pyongyang and various provinces, cities, and some factories and enterprises hold large-scale anti-American struggle rallies and demonstrations. Leaders from various sectors, war victims' families, veterans of the Fatherland Liberation War, and other representatives speak at the rallies, protesting against the atrocities committed by the United States during the war and its long-standing policy of hostility towards North Korea. During "Anti-American Struggle Month," various newspapers and other media continuously remind the people to stay vigilant and introduce the efforts made by the North Korean Party and government to achieve lasting peace and independent reunification on the Korean Peninsula. At this year's June 25 rally in Pyongyang, Choe Won-sun, Secretary of the Pyongyang City Committee of the Workers' Party of Korea and Chairman of the Pyongyang City People's Committee, said that as long as U.S. troops remain in South Korea, the Korean nation will face the danger of war and permanent division. He strongly demanded the withdrawal of U.S. troops from South Korea and urged the Seoul authorities to abandon the "two Koreas" policy.

The long-term presence of U.S. troops in South Korea not only faces opposition from the people of North Korea but also seriously hurts the self-respect of the South Korean people. Among the South Korean people, especially among young students, anti-American sentiments are on the rise. The United States should stop interfering in the internal affairs of other countries and withdraw its troops from the Korean Peninsula as soon as possible.

### 朝鲜举行“反美斗争月”

　　朝鲜举行“反美斗争月”
    新华社记者  朱克川
    ６月２５日下午６时许，在平壤市中心的金日成广场和主要街道上，２０万名平壤市各界群众举行了一次声势浩大的反美集会和示威游行。在历时两个小时的活动中，与会群众谴责美国军队继续留驻南朝鲜的口号声此起彼伏，表现了朝鲜人民强烈的反美情绪。
    ６月２５日，是朝鲜人民最难忘记的日子。３９年前的这一天，美国和南朝鲜李承晚政权突然发动了朝鲜战争。从此，一场艰苦卓绝的战争强加到了朝鲜人民的头上。国家安全受到严重威胁的中国人民也不得不派出自己的优秀儿女，为保家卫国做出了巨大的牺牲。在为期３年的战争中，年轻的朝鲜民主主义人民共和国的城乡建设遭到了严重破坏，成千上万的人民惨遭杀害，许多美满的家庭妻离子散，３０多年后的今天仍旧天各一方。
    ３年战争的教训和战后美国继续敌视人民共和国的现实，使朝鲜人民认识到，美国是破坏朝鲜半岛和平和阻碍朝鲜实现统一的主谋。因此，朝鲜政府把每年的６月２５日至７月２７日定为“反美斗争月”。每逢“６·２５”前后，平壤和各道（省）、市以及部分工厂企业都举行声势浩大的反美斗争集会和示威游行，各地的党政主要负责人、战争受害者家属、参加过祖国解放战争的老战士和其他各界代表分别在集会上讲话，抗议美国在战争中犯下的暴行和长期执行敌视朝鲜的政策。在“反美斗争月”期间，各种报刊和其他舆论机构，不断提醒人民要保持警惕，并介绍朝鲜党和政府为实现朝鲜半岛巩固的和平与国家的自主和平统一所进行的努力。朝鲜劳动党平壤市委员会责任书记兼平壤市人民委员会委员长崔文善在今年“６·２５”平壤市群众集会上讲话说，只要美国军队继续留在南朝鲜，朝鲜民族就难以避免战争和永久分裂的危险。他强烈要求美军撤出南朝鲜，并敦促汉城当局放弃“两个朝鲜”政策。
    美国军队长期驻扎在南朝鲜，不仅遭到朝鲜北方人民的反对，也严重伤害了南朝鲜人民的自尊心。在南朝鲜人民中间，尤其是在青年学生中间，反美情绪日趋高涨。美国应该停止干涉别国的内政，尽早把自己的军队从朝鲜半岛撤走。
