The Yan Emperor's Mausoleum in Tancun County

In recent times, Tancun County in Hunan has restored the Yan Emperor's Mausoleum.

The *Book of Jin* records: "In his later years, the Yan Emperor Shen Nong treated the people's illnesses, gathered herbs in Hunan, and died from tasting poisonous plants, buried in Changsha." (Jin Dynasty, Huangfu Mi's *Records of Emperors and Kings*). The *Book of Roads and Empires* by Song Dynasty scholar Luo Bi also states: "The Yan Emperor Shen Nong died and was buried in Chaling, which is known as Tea Mountain." According to historical records, this refers to the present-day western border city of Tancun County in Hunan. This year during the Qingming Festival, the Hunan Provincial Government's Advisory Office invited several renowned figures from home and abroad to the Yan Emperor's Mausoleum to participate in the first ancestral worship ceremony since its restoration.

The Yan Emperor's Mausoleum is located west of Tancun County. The mountains and bamboo groves remain lush and verdant. It is surrounded by a bright red wall. Entering the courtyard, climbing the steps, and passing through the Meridian Gate into the hall, the more than one-meter-high wall encloses two rows of stele pavilions, a worship pavilion, the main hall, and the Yan Emperor's tomb, forming a rectangular whole. Along with more than a dozen ancient trees of rare species, their new leaves spread out like a canopy, swaying gently on the glazed tiles of the main hall's roof, as if casting layer upon layer of halos. The buildings are solemn and magnificent, and the temple is spacious and bright.

Surrounding the temple, there are more than a thousand years of historical buildings constructed by successive dynasties, including the Temple of Heaven, the Arch of Virtue, the Heavenly Envoy's Residence, the Accompanying Sacrifice Residence, the Tasting Herbs Pavilion, and the Herb-Washing Pool, forming a grand architectural complex.

The temple is situated beside a slope of pine trees, with the Xuan River flowing around the foot of the mountain in a reluctant circle. Across the Xuan River, there is a stretch of farmland, and a few yellow oxen are plowing. Perhaps five thousand years ago, the Yan Emperor also cultivated here. It is hard to imagine how ancient people, with their knowledge, chose such a good location when they built the Yan Emperor's tomb. The Chinese nation, spanning five thousand years from ancient times to the present, has an eternal centripetal force and cohesion towards the Yellow Emperor and the Yan Emperor. Apart from the Yan Emperor, who "first made the hoe and plow, taught people to farm, tasted hundreds of herbs, discovered medicine, processed hemp into cloth, and opened the first market," the *Classic of Huai* also records the merits of Shen Nong. I believe this is the reason why Shen Nong is remembered by later generations.

　　酃县炎帝陵
    李树型
    湖南酃县，最近修复了一座炎帝陵。
    《晋书》里曾记载：“炎帝神农氏晚年为民治病，采药到湖南，味毒草而殁葬长沙。”（晋·皇甫谧《帝王纪事》）宋朝罗泌所著《路史》也说：“炎帝神农崩葬于长沙茶乡之尾，是曰茶陵。”据考，即今湖南西陲边城酃县。今年清明，湖南省人民政府参事室，邀请了海内外一些知名人士，前往炎帝陵，举行修复后的首次祭陵谒祖仪式。
    炎帝陵坐落在酃县城西。依然是云山逶迤，翠竹丛丛。它被耀眼的红色围墙簇拥着。进入院内，跨上台阶，从午门入殿，那一丈多高的围墙，把左右两排碑亭、拜礼亭、正殿、炎帝陵寝，围成一个长方形整体。加上十多株稀世参天古树，展开用新叶织成的华盖，在大殿琉璃瓦屋顶上，飘飘摇摇，像是往瓦上撒落出层层光环。屋宇庄严华美，庙堂宽浩敞亮。
    祠庙的周围山里，还有一千多年来历代相继建造的奉天寺、崇德坊、天使公馆、陪祭公馆、味草亭和洗药池，组成一个规模宏大的古建筑群。
    祠庙坐落在松树山坡旁，山脚下洣江围绕着环流一圈，依依不舍流去。洣江对岸，一片农田，几条黄牛正在翻耕。兴许五千年前，炎帝也在这里耕种过。想象不出，上古的人，凭借什么知识，建炎帝陵墓地时选择了这么好的地势。连绵五千年的中华民族，从古至今，对炎黄怀有永恒的向心力和凝聚力。除了炎帝，“始作耒耜，教民耕种，普尝百草，发明医药，治麻为布、首辟市场”外，《越绝书》还对神农氏的功德作了记载。我想这就是神农氏受到后人纪念的道理了。
