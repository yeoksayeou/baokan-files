Troops Under Martial Law Cherish Beijing's Historic Sites

	The People's Daily, Beijing, June 17th - "Beijing has many historic sites and treasures. It is our duty as troops under martial law to cherish and protect these precious historical gems," said Major General Qin Tao, the commander, and Major General Hao Gongcheng, the political commissar of a certain division of the Beijing Garrison Command, during an interview with reporters at the martial law command center a few days ago. Since then, the soldiers of their division have been protecting Beijing's historic sites as if they were their own eyes.

	After the martial law order was issued in parts of Beijing, this division was deployed to various units to take on guard duties. Many ancient buildings and cultural relics are located within these guard areas, some of which are listed as key protected sites by the State Council, and others as key guarded sites by the Beijing Municipal Government. The division leaders demanded that all levels of leadership strictly manage the troops while seriously carrying out civilized duty education. They required every soldier to protect the cultural relics and ancient sites within their duty areas and near their posts as if they were their own eyes.

	The second battalion of a certain regiment is responsible for guarding an area that includes two ancient sites built during the Ming Dynasty. The officers and soldiers not only perform their duties but also help the management department clean up garbage and maintain the lawns. Since there are many pine trees in the courtyard and most of the ancient sites are made of wood, the entire courtyard is listed as a first-class fire prevention area. Based on this situation, all the officers and soldiers actively participated in a no-smoking campaign, eliminating fire hazards. The officers and soldiers of a certain regiment responsible for guarding a key position live in a hall that was once the place where the traitor Yuan Shikai ascended the throne. This hall is listed as a key cultural relic protection unit by the Beijing Municipal Government. The officers and soldiers voluntarily comply with indoor regulations, mark out activity areas, and install isolation signs, ensuring that the indoor facilities and exhibits remain intact.

　　戒严部队爱护首都名胜古迹
    本报北京６月１７日讯  “首都名胜古迹较多，珍惜、爱护这些珍贵的历史瑰宝是我们戒严部队官兵应尽的职贵。”担负戒严任务的北京卫戍区某师师长秦涛、政委郝功成大校日前在戒严指挥部接受笔者采访时讲了这一番话。几天来，他们所在的部队官兵像爱护自己的眼睛一样爱护着首都的名胜古迹。
    北京部分地区实行戒严的命令下达后，这个部队先后开进一些单位担负警卫值勤任务，这些警卫区域内的古建筑、古文物较多，有的被国务院列为重点保护，也有的被北京市政府列为重点看管。师领导要求各级领导在严格管理部队的同时，认真抓好文明执勤教育，要求每个战士像爱护自己的眼睛一样，保护好值勤区域内和距执勤点较近的文物古迹。某团二营担负的警卫值勤区域有建于明朝年间的两处古迹，干部战士一面执勤，一面帮助管理部门清除垃圾，护理草坪。由于院内油松较多，加之两处古迹多属木质结构，大院被列为一级防火区。根据这一情况，全体官兵积极开展戒烟活动，消除了火灾隐患。担负某要害部位执勤的所属某团官兵所住宿的礼堂，曾是卖国贼袁世凯当年登基的地方，被北京市政府列为重点文物保护单位，干部战士自觉遵守室内规定，并划出活动范围，安上隔离标志，使室内设施及陈列品完好无损。
