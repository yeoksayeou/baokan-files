Take Active Measures to Save Hainan's Wildlife

Hainan Island is China's second-largest island, with abundant rainfall, evergreen forests throughout the year, and rich forest vegetation, making it an ideal habitat for animals. Currently, the island is home to 78 species of mammals, including several key protected species such as the gibbon, Hainan sika deer, water deer, macaque, clouded leopard, large civet, and small civet. At present, these wild animals are either on the brink of extinction or have seen a significant decline in numbers. To protect and develop Hainan Island's wildlife, it is suggested that relevant departments take measures to legally investigate and punish those who illegally hunt and poach wildlife, and protect the habitats of wild animals.

　　积极采取措施
    挽救海南动物
    海南岛是我国第二大岛，雨量充沛，四季常青，森林植被丰富，是动物生活的最佳地区。现在，全岛共有兽类７８种，其中列为国家重点保护的兽类有长臂猿、海南坡鹿、水鹿、猕猴、云豹、大灵猫、小灵猫等。目前，这些野生动物在海南岛有的濒于绝迹，有的数量大幅度下降。为了保护和发展海南岛的野生动物，建议有关部门采取措施，依法查处乱捕滥猎野生动物的不法分子，保护野生动物的栖息地。
