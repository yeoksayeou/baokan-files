All sectors unite to raise funds for the Asian Games

Beijing, June 24 (Xinhua) - The organizing committee of the 11th Asian Games held a press conference yesterday to report on the progress of fundraising for the event. Wang Zhiliang, head of the fundraising department, announced that as of now, 370 million yuan has been raised, leaving a shortfall of 230 million yuan to reach the 600 million yuan target. He expressed confidence in meeting the fundraising goal.

Wang Zhiliang said: The entire nation is concerned about the 11th Asian Games. Many units, enterprises, and individuals have donated money and goods in various forms. Even primary and secondary school students have saved their pocket money to donate to the Asian Games. Beijing's No. 31 Middle School, despite its tight educational budget, donated a newly produced oven worth 100,000 yuan to show their support for the Asian Games. Statistics show that in the past month and a half, the foundation has received over 200 remittance slips from all over the country, totaling more than 400 million yuan.

Wang Zhiliang stated that after the suppression of the riots, the fundraising work will be further strengthened to ensure the successful completion of the task. He announced the "three unchanged" principles for fundraising: the methods, policies, and targets for fundraising will remain unchanged; already signed agreements and contracts will remain unchanged; and the principles of mutual benefit, equality, and sincere cooperation will remain unchanged. At the meeting, relevant personnel also disclosed information about the issuance of Asian Games fund reward coupons and proposed to strengthen the organization of exclusive sales of Asian Games patented products and advertisements to further raise funds.

　　各界齐心协力为亚运会多集资
    本报北京六月二十四日讯  记者黄振中报道：昨天，第十一届亚运会组委会集资部召开新闻发布会，介绍亚运会集资工作情况。集资部部长王志良宣布，到目前为止已集资三点七亿元人民币，距六亿元的目标还差二点三亿元。他对完成集资任务充满信心。
    王志良说：全国人民都关心第十一届亚运会，许多单位、企业和个人通过各种形式向亚运会捐款捐物，连中小学生也把平时零花钱省下来捐给亚运会。北京第三十一中本来办学经费紧张，但是为了表示他们对亚运会的关心和支持，把自己校办厂刚生产出的价值一万元的烤鸡炉捐给亚运会。据统计，五月份以来的一个多月里，基金会共收到全国各地寄来的汇款单二百多件，金额达四百多万元。
    王志良表示，平息暴乱后，要进一步加强集资工作，保证圆满完成任务。他宣布了集资工作“三不变”原则：即集资方法、政策、目标不变；已签订的协议、合同不变；互惠互利、平等协商、真诚合作的原则不变。会上，有关人士还透露了将发行亚运会基金奖券的信息，并提出要加强组织专营、出售亚运会专利以及广告等工作，以进一步集资。
