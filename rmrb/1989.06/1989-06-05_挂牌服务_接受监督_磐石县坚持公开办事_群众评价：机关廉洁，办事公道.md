Panshi County in Jilin Province has implemented a system where the county committee and government departments publicly disclose their operations and accept supervision from the public. The general consensus among the people is that the government agencies are clean and fair in their dealings.

The various departments in Panshi County have adopted different methods to publicly disclose the following four aspects of their operations: first, they publish the scope of responsibilities for each internal division, the names and positions of the staff, the legal provisions and procedures that public servants follow when enforcing the law and managing affairs, and the final outcomes of services provided to the public. All personnel who frequently interact with the public are required to wear name tags for service. Second, they establish regulations and systems to address any gaps or weaknesses in management and institutional structures. Third, they implement measures to serve the public more conveniently. Fourth, they publish regulations related to rewards and punishments.

While insisting on public disclosure of operations, Panshi County has also expanded and improved channels for supervision. Each department has an internal supervision system and has set up complaint boxes and supervision hotlines. They have also appointed supervisors from among the public and department leaders regularly receive visitors. Some departments even periodically invite service recipients to evaluate their work.

Since implementing the public disclosure of operations system half a year ago, Panshi County has seen noticeable results. The public has become more aware of their right to participate in politics and are more willing to defend their legitimate interests and report issues. The construction of a clean government has also been strengthened. A farmer wrote to the county's Metrology Bureau, reporting that a store under the county's Materials Bureau sold cement that was underweight. The Metrology Bureau investigated and found the allegation to be true, confiscating the store's illegal earnings, imposing a fine, and ordering them to deliver the two tons of cement that were shorted to the farmer's home. The county's Health Bureau received a tip-off about a few medical staff at the county hospital deliberately overprescribing medications for patients and keeping a portion for themselves. The bureau director immediately went to the hospital to investigate, ordering the hospital director to apologize to the whistleblower at their workplace, and refunding the money for the overprescribed medications. The county hospital also deducted the monthly bonus of the individuals involved and had them publicly reflect on their actions at a staff meeting. Since implementing the public disclosure of operations, the county's Tax Bureau has received 52 reports of tax evasion, all of which have been investigated and resolved, with a total of 100,000 yuan in back taxes collected.

　　挂牌服务　接受监督
    磐石县坚持公开办事
    群众评价：机关廉洁，办事公道
    新华社长春６月５日电  吉林省磐石县委和县政府所属部、局公开办事制度，广泛接受监督。群众的评价是：机关廉洁，办事公道。
    磐石县各部门采取各种形式公开以下四方面的办事内容：一是公布本部门内设机构的职责范围，干部的姓名、职务，公职人员执法、管理所依据的条款、办事的程序和为群众办事的最终结果，经常与群众接触的管理、监督人员一律实行挂牌服务；二是针对管理上、体制上的漏洞及薄弱环节而建立的规章制度；三是便民服务措施；四是奖惩的有关规定。
    在坚持公开办事的同时，磐石县进一步疏通和拓宽了监督渠道。各部门内部都有监督系统，并且普遍设立了举报箱、监督电话，在群众中聘请了监督员，部门领导定期接待来访群众。有的部门还定期请服务对象对本部门工作予以讲评。
    磐石县实行公开办事制度半年来，已取得明显效果。群众增强了参政议政意识，敢于维护自己的正当利益，也敢于举报问题，机关的廉政建设也有所加强。一位农民给县计量局写信，反映县物资局下属一家商店卖出的水泥不足量，县计量局查实后，没收了这家商店的非法收入，处以罚款，并且责令他们把少付给农民的两吨水泥送到农民家里。县卫生局接到举报电话，反映县医院少数医务人员故意给病人多开好药，自己从中分一部分。局长立即去县医院查处，责令院长到举报人工作单位向举报人赔礼道歉，退还多开的药的现款。县医院还扣发了当事人的月奖金，责令他们在全院职工大会上公开检查。县税务局公开办事制度以来，先后接到群众举报偷漏税案５２件，都已全部查处，共补缴税款１０万元。
