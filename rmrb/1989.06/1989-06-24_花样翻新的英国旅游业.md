Shakespeare once said, “Britain is a string of jewels set in a silver sea.” Every year, more than fifteen million tourists visit Britain, making tourism a significant source of foreign exchange earnings. This is not only due to Britain's picturesque countryside and numerous historical sites but also to the creative ideas and diligent efforts of the British tourism industry.

Several years ago, a tourism company launched the Victoria Tourist Train to the Scottish Highlands, covering a distance of 1,100 kilometers. Passengers can dine in the world's oldest dining car, built in 1891, and enjoy Scottish delicacies such as salmon, venison, and the globally renowned Scotch whisky, as well as champagne. Along the way, besides enjoying the beautiful coastal scenery of the Highlands, tourists can visit numerous historical sites, such as the ancient Ashton Abbey, the ruins of the Gaelic Parliament, the ancient fortress of Clan Cameron, and the country estate of the Stuart kings. During the six-day journey, there is also a visit to Glamis Castle, the setting of Shakespeare's famous play "Macbeth" and the childhood home of Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

The British tourism department places great importance on marine tourism. The giant yacht "Princess Diana," known as the "floating palace," has a tonnage of 45,000 tons and can accommodate 1,260 passengers. The ship has 600 first-class cabins, 152 suites, each with a private balcony, and is equipped with color TV, telephone, refrigerator, and a bathroom with both a shower and a bathtub. The yacht is adorned with 800 varieties of flowers, has four swimming pools, two freshwater reservoirs, ten bars, and a disco hall with a marble floor. A French head chef oversees the culinary operations. The yacht even publishes a daily newspaper.

The British tourism organization considers that after a week of intense work, people hope to have a peaceful weekend. Therefore, in villages with old traditions and lifestyles, they have organized tourist spots, allowing visitors to enter rustic homes, appreciate the unfamiliar yet interesting lifestyle of urban residents, and enjoy a "weekend retreat in a rural village." Bartley and Burley are two elegant and ancient villages with houses built 500 years ago and ancient fireplaces. Some families still use kitchens that are 400 years old. The two villages win over tourists with their hospitality and centuries-old lifestyle, bringing them joy away from the city.

There is also the caravan holiday tour in Ireland. Tourists, like gypsies, drive horse-drawn caravans through the quiet country roads of Ireland, leisurely traveling twelve miles a day. The caravans are equipped with two to four single beds, a small food cabinet, a bathtub, a gas stove, and horse feed. The bedding, including sheets, blankets, and pillows, is clean and elegant. Before tourists take the reins, they receive training on driving the caravan. This allows them to freely arrange their itinerary.

Additionally, the British tourism organization holds various entertainment activities during the peak tourist season, such as ballet, puppet shows, opera, magic, and comedy, to attract tourists.

　　花样翻新的英国旅游业
    莎士比亚曾说：“英国是镶在银色海洋上的一串珠宝”。每年来英国的旅游者多达一千五百万，旅游已成为英国外汇收入的一大源泉。这不仅要归功于英国旖旎的田园风光，众多的文物古迹，还要归功于英国旅游部门的奇思异想和苦心经营。
    数年前，一家旅游公司筹建了开往苏格兰高地的维多利亚旅游列车，行程一千一百公里，游客可在建于一八九一年的目前世界最古老的餐车中进膳，品尝苏格兰的鲑鱼、鹿肉和名闻全球的苏格兰威士忌以及香槟等名菜佳酿。沿途除欣赏优美多姿的高地海滨景色外，还可游览众多的古迹，如古老的阿什顿修道院、盖尔族的议会遗址、喀米伦克兰族的古代要塞，以及斯图亚特王朝国王的乡村宅邸。在六天的游程中，还包括去格拉梅丝古堡的游览，这个古堡就是莎士比亚的名剧《麦克佩斯》的背景地，也是伊丽莎白王太后孩童时代的故乡。
    英国旅游部门非常重视海洋旅游，被称为“水上浮宫”的巨型游艇“戴安娜王妃号”，载重四点五万吨，可载乘客一千二百六十人，船上有六百个特等卧室，一百五十二个套间，每间有专用阳台，并备有彩电、电话、冰箱、盆淋兼备的浴室。游艇内有八百种花草，四个游泳池，两个淡水库，十间酒吧，一所大理石地板的迪斯科舞厅。聘有一位法国总厨师，统管饮食烹调。游艇上还出版一份日报。
    英国的旅游组织考虑到人们在一周紧张的工作后，希望过一个平静的周末，因而在有古老传统建筑和生活习俗的小村中组织起旅游点，让游人走进古朴的家庭，欣赏一下城市居民陌生而感兴趣的生活格调，享受一番“乡野小村的周末小憩”。巴特斯莱和布立莱是两个幽雅而古老的村庄，村中有五百年前建造的房屋和古老的壁炉。有的家庭还在使用有四百年历史的厨房，两个小村以好客的热情和历经数世纪而未变的生活情调征服旅游者，给他们带来远离市廛的愉悦。
    还有爱尔兰的大篷车度假旅游。游客像吉卜赛人那样，驾着马拉大篷车，在幽静的爱尔兰乡间小道上，悠闲地一天漫游十二哩。大篷车备有两至四张单卧铺，车内备有小食品橱、洗澡盆、煤气灶，并供应马的饲料。卧铺上的床单、被褥、枕头清洁而雅致。在游客接受马和大篷车之前，要接受一定的驾车训练。这样他们就可自由地安排游览的时间表。
    此外，英国旅游组织还在旅游旺季举办各种文娱活动，如芭蕾舞、傀儡戏、歌剧、魔术、滑稽等，以招徕旅游者。
