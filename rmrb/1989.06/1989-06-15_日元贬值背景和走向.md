Title: The Background and Trend of the Yen's Depreciation

Since the beginning of 1989, the yen's exchange rate has been plummeting. At the start of the year, the dollar-to-yen exchange rate hovered around 1:125. After three months of fluctuation, it broke through 1:130. From early April to the end of May, the Bank of Japan sold nearly $200 billion in the foreign exchange market, but the dollar-to-yen rate still surged past 1:140. On May 31, the Bank of Japan, which had maintained a stable stance amidst the wave of rising interest rates in Western countries, raised its discount rate for the first time in 9 years and 2 months. However, this did not stop the yen's downward trend. On June 14, Japanese Ministry of Finance officials summoned leaders of financial institutions, urging them to refrain from buying dollars in the frenzy, and not to follow the trend of dollar appreciation. Despite taking consecutive measures, the dollar-to-yen rate still broke through 1:150. From 1:140 to 1:150, it only took half a month. The yen's depreciation shows no signs of stopping.

The continuous depreciation of the yen has both economic and political backgrounds. In terms of economic factors, the fluctuation of the dollar-to-yen exchange rate is primarily influenced by changes in the U.S. economy. This year, the U.S. economic growth rate has declined, showing signs of reducing the fiscal deficit. The trade deficit has been decreasing, and inflation concerns have also eased. Investors in the foreign exchange market are optimistic about the U.S. economy's "soft landing" and are eager to buy dollars. Secondly, there is the interest rate differential between the U.S. and Japan. Even after the Bank of Japan raised its discount rate, the annual interest rate is only 3.25%, compared to the U.S.'s 7% discount rate, which is still a significant gap. Investors naturally choose high-interest-rate currencies. Among the various economic indicators reflecting the U.S. economic situation, there are also warning signals that make it difficult for the U.S. to decide on easing monetary policy and lowering interest rates. Thirdly, while the appreciation of the dollar is beneficial for attracting investment, it also hinders the expansion of product exports, presenting both advantages and disadvantages. In the current situation, the U.S. has chosen a strategy where the benefits outweigh the drawbacks, adopting a non-interventionist attitude towards the dollar's appreciation, which has also contributed to the continuous rise in the dollar's exchange rate.

In the process of the yen's continuous depreciation, political factors have played a significant role. This year, the support rate for the Takeshita cabinet has been declining. According to Japanese political norms, when the cabinet's support rate falls below 30%, it indicates the onset of "end-of-regime symptoms." In mid-May, the succession of the Japanese Prime Minister became uncertain, exacerbating political instability. The political trust crisis in Japan has led to a decline in the yen's credibility in the foreign exchange market. "Buy dollars when there's trouble" is a common speculative mentality among Western foreign exchange market investors.

Will the yen's exchange rate continue to fall? Financial experts believe that the downward trend will not stop immediately, but the possibility of the dollar-to-yen rate dropping to 1:160 in one go is not high. Because a further rise in the dollar is not beneficial for anyone. If the dollar continues to appreciate, the competitiveness of U.S. exports will decline, leading to production shrinkage, and economic recovery will become a mirage. If the yen continues to depreciate, Japanese prices will rise, triggering inflation, which is something Japan is trying to avoid. Moreover, since the September 1985 coordination of financial policies by Western countries' finance ministers, allowing the yen to appreciate from a 1:240 dollar-to-yen rate, the economic foundations of the U.S. and Japan have not changed: the U.S. is still plagued by fiscal and trade deficits, becoming the largest debtor nation. Japan, on the other hand, has been prosperous with abundant foreign exchange reserves, making it the largest creditor nation. Therefore, this depreciation of the yen does not reflect the change in economic strength between the U.S. and Japan. Experts here believe that, in the long term, the yen's appreciation and the dollar's depreciation are still the inevitable trend. The rush to buy dollars is just a short-term speculative phenomenon. By autumn, the yen's exchange rate is expected to rebound.

The world is ever-changing, and exchange rate trends are even harder to predict. Just as the dollar-to-yen rate approached 1:120 at the end of 1987, surprising the experts, and just as the experts' prediction of reaching 1:110 in the first half of this year turned out to be far from reality, experts' predictions can also be wrong and can only serve as a reference.

　　日元贬值背景和走向
    本报记者  于青
    进入１９８９年以来，日元汇价直线下跌。年初，美元对日元比价还在１∶１２５之间，徘徊３个月后，突破１∶１３０。从４月初到５月末，日本银行共抛售近２００亿美元介入外汇市场，美元对日元比价还是突破了１∶１４０。５月３１日，一向在西方国家竞相提高利率浪潮中稳坐钓鱼台的日本银行，在９年零２个月之后首次提高贴现率，但仍未能阻止日元下跌的颓势。６月１４日，日本大藏省官员召集金融企业首领，要求他们在抢购美元风潮中自肃，不要随波逐流，助长美元上涨。尽管接连采取措施，今天，美元对日元比价还是一举突破１∶１５０。从１∶１４０到１∶１５０，仅用半个月功夫。日元下跌之势大有不可阻挡之势。
    日元持续下跌，有经济和政治两个方面的背景。在经济背景中，美元对日元比价的波动，首先是受美国经济状况变化的影响。今年以来，美国经济增长率下降，出现有利于财政赤字减少的迹象。贸易赤字不断减少，通货膨胀隐忧也随之减少。外汇市场投资者们对美国经济“软着陆”寄予期待，踊跃购买美元。其次是美日两国的利率差。日本银行提高贴现率后，年息仍不过是３．２５％，与美国年息７％的贴现率相比，仍然存在较大差距。投资者选择高利率货币是人所共知的。在表明美国经济现状的各种经济指标中，也有警告的信号，使美国方面难以做出放松银根、降低利率的决断。其三，美元升值对美国来说，虽然有利于吸引投资，但也有碍于扩大产品出口，利弊兼而有之。在目前的形势中，美国方面审时度势选择利大于弊的决策，对美元升值采取不积极介入的听之任之态度，也助长了美元汇价持续上涨。
    在日元持续下跌过程中，很大程度受政治因素的影响。今年以来，竹下内阁支持率不断下降。按日本政界的常识，内阁支持率跌落到３０％以下，就预示出现“政权末期症状”。５月份中，日本首相后继人选难产，加剧政局动荡，日本政治信任危机在外汇市场的连锁反应是日元信誉下降。“有事买美元”是西方外汇市场投资者们惯有的投机心理。
    日元汇价还会下跌？金融界人士认为，下跌势头不会马上刹住，但美元对日元比价一气跌到１∶１６０的可能性不大。因为美元再涨对谁来说都不是好事。美元继续升值，美国产品出口竞争力下降，引起生产萎缩，经济恢复将化为泡影。日元持续下跌，日本物价上涨，诱发通货膨胀，是日本方面极力避免的。再者，从１９８５年９月西方国家财政部长协调金融政策，允许日元从１∶２４０的美元日元比价升值以来，美日两国经济基础条件没有发生变化：美国仍为财政贸易双赤字困扰，沦为最大的债务国。而日本一直景气，外汇储备雄厚，又是最大债权国。因此，这次日元下跌并不反应美日两国经济实力的变化。此间专家认为，长期观点而言，日元升值美元贬值仍是大势所趋。抢购美元不过是短期性投机现象，入秋之后，日元汇价可望上扬。
    世情多变，汇率走向更难预测。如同１９８７年底美元对日元比价迫近１∶１２０，出乎行家们料想一样，也如同今年初行家们认为上半年会接近１∶１１０的估计与现实大相径庭一样，行家们的预测也难免失误，仅能参考。
