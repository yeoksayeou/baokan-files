Recently, the urban social and economic survey team of Liaoning Province and Benxi City conducted a survey among 260 neighborhood committee cadres regarding the cultural and recreational activities of minors. The findings are as follows:

First, there are few activity venues for minors, and most children cannot join activity classes. Benxi City has 170,000 minors. Many parents hope their children can have rich and varied extracurricular activities to cultivate their interests from a young age, but this is difficult to achieve. Some parents say: "Children usually go to school, and on holidays, they occasionally visit a park. Otherwise, they stay at home or wander around with a keychain around their necks. This is not safe, and it is difficult for them to learn extracurricular knowledge."

Based on the feedback from neighborhood committee cadres and parents, we visited the staff of the city's Youth Palace. They said: "The public's feedback reflects the actual situation. Currently, our city has only two Youth Palaces (one is district-run), both built in the 1950s and 1960s, with very outdated facilities. The largest Youth Palace in the city has an area of only 2,400 square meters. The first floor is occupied by the Municipal Communist Youth League, and the second floor is filled with family members, serving as a dormitory. Now, the learning classes held by the Youth Palace each year can only accommodate 3.7% of minors, and the vast majority of children cannot join the classes.

Second, there are few grassroots youth activity stations, making it difficult to organize more children to participate in extracurricular activities. According to the survey, Benxi City currently has only 36 activity venues for minors. Among them, there are 14 street-level youth homes and 20 activity stations, with a total activity area of 7,600 square meters, or 0.04 square meters per minor. The cultural and recreational facilities in these activity venues are very simple and outdated, and the quantity is extremely limited, far from meeting the children's desire for knowledge and intellectual growth.

Third, there are no dedicated cinemas for minors. Many parents have pointed out that in a city with nearly 1.5 million people, there is not a single cinema dedicated to minors. Currently, the order in cinemas is chaotic, and moreover, some films are not suitable for minors to watch, making parents reluctant to let their children go to the cinema.

In response to this, we hope that the entire society will pay attention to the cultural and recreational venues for minors, so that they can grow up healthily.

### 孩子们课外无处娱乐

　　孩子们课外无处娱乐
    最近辽宁省及本溪市城市社会经济调查队就少年儿童文化娱乐活动场所情况，在２６０名街委干部中进行了一次调查，反映如下：  　一是少年儿童活动场所少，大多数儿童进不了活动班。本溪市有１７万少年儿童，很多家长希望自己的子女课外活动丰富多采，从小培养子女情趣，而现在却很难得到满足。一些家长说：“孩子平时上学，节假日偶尔去一趟公园，其余时间呆在家里或脖子上挂一串钥匙到处野跑，一是不安全，二是很难学到课外知识。”
    根据街委干部及家长们的反映，我们又走访了市少年宫的工作人员，他们说：“群众的反映符合实际情况，目前我市仅有两所少年宫（一所是区办的），都建于五六十年代，各种设施都很落后。市内最大的一所少年宫面积仅有２４００平方米，宫内三层楼，一层被团市委占用，一层住满了家属，成了宿舍。现在少年宫每年举办的学习班，只能有３．７％的少年儿童参加，绝大多数儿童进不了学习班。
    二是基层少年活动站少，无法更多地组织儿童参加课外活动。据调查，目前本溪市少年儿童活动场所仅有３６处。其中：街道少年之家１４个，活动站２０个，活动面积仅有７６００平方米，全市少年儿童人均０．０４平方米。这些活动场所的文娱活动设施也相当简陋、陈旧，而且数量极少，根本满足不了孩子们渴求知识、增长智慧的需求。
    三是没有少年儿童专用的影剧院，很多家长反映：近１５０万人口的本溪，竟没有一个少年儿童专用的影剧院。现在影剧院秩序很乱，再说一些影剧也不宜少年儿童观看，家长不放心自己的孩子到影剧院去。
    对此我们希望，全社会都要关心少年儿童的文化娱乐活动场所，使他们能健康地成长。
