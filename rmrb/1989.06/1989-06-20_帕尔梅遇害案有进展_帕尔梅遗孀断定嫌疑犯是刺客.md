Stockholm, June 19 (Reported by Gù Yàomíng) - Today, the widow of the late Swedish Prime Minister Olof Palme, Lisbet Palme, testified in court. She identified the suspect currently under interrogation as the assassin of her husband.

Since the trial of the suspect in the Palme assassination began on June 5, several witnesses have testified in court, accusing the 42-year-old man of being involved in the assassination. However, some witnesses have also testified to exclude the possibility of his involvement.

At Lisbet Palme's request, the suspect did not appear in court during her testimony. She recounted that before the incident, when she and Palme left the cinema, she noticed someone watching them from the shadows. As they approached the scene of the crime, she heard a sound similar to a firecracker, and Palme immediately fell to the ground. She then heard another sound and saw the man she had previously noticed standing nearby. She remembered his appearance.

Mrs. Palme answered questions from the judge and the defense lawyer in court. As her testimony was about to conclude, the suspect was brought into the courtroom. This was the first time Mrs. Palme had faced the suspect since his arrest. When she saw the man, she confidently stated that he was the person she had seen at the scene of the crime.

Some local lawyers believe that although her testimony is very important, it does not rule out the possibility that the actual assassin was nearby and that Mrs. Palme did not see him. So far, no witness has testified that the suspect fired the gun or had a weapon in his hand. According to Swedish law, if the court can rule out the possibility of other suspects and there is no evidence of the murder weapon or witnesses seeing the suspect commit the crime, the suspect can be convicted.

　　帕尔梅遇害案有进展    
    帕尔梅遗孀断定嫌疑犯是刺客
    本报斯德哥尔摩６月１９日电  记者顾耀铭报道：今天上午瑞典已故首相帕尔梅的夫人丽丝帕特·帕尔梅出庭作证，她断定正在被审讯的嫌疑犯是刺杀她丈夫的凶手。
    自本月５日对刺杀帕尔梅的嫌疑犯开审以来，已有一些证人在法庭上作证指控这名４２岁的男子有刺杀帕尔梅的嫌疑，但也有人作证排除他进行刺杀的可能。
    应丽丝帕特·帕尔梅的要求，在她出庭作证时，嫌疑犯不出场。她谈到，出事前，当她同帕尔梅从电影院出来时，她发现有一个人在暗中盯着她看。当他们走到出事地点时，她听到一声类似爆竹的响声，帕尔梅随即倒在地上。她接着又听到另一声响声，她看到了旁边站着先前见到的那个男子，她记住了他的相貌。
    帕尔梅夫人在法庭上回答了法官和辩护律师提出的问题。在作证即将结束时，嫌疑犯被带入法庭，这是帕尔梅夫人自该犯被押以来第一次面对面相遇。当帕尔梅夫人见到这名男子时，非常肯定地说，这就是她在出事地点见到的人。
    此间一些律师认为，她的证词虽然十分重要，但仍不能排除真正的凶手在出事地点附近，帕尔梅夫人没有看到他。迄今为止，所有证人都没有能作证此犯开了枪或手中持有枪支。根据瑞典法律，在无法获得凶器或无人能作证见到嫌疑犯进行犯罪行为的情况下，如果法庭能够排除其他人作案的可能，可以裁决此人为凶手。
