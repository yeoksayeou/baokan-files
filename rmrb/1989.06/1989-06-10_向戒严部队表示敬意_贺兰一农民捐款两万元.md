A farmer from Helan County in the Ningxia Hui Autonomous Region, who wishes to remain anonymous, recently sent a letter to the Ningxia Military Region, donating 20,000 yuan. The money is to be transferred to the State Council and the martial law troops in the capital. A reporter has seen the original letter.

The farmer wrote in the letter: "I, on behalf of the broad masses of farmers, donate 5,000 yuan to the family of the soldier who was killed by counter-revolutionary rioters and then thrown off the Chongwenmen overpass and burned with gasoline, as funeral expenses. I donate 10,000 yuan to the martial law troops as a token of appreciation. I donate 5,000 yuan to other meritorious individuals. This is the sentiment of farmers who have become prosperous."

The farmer also wrote in the letter: "The officers and soldiers of the martial law troops, most of you come from peasant families. You deeply understand the life of peasants ten years ago, and now the living standards of the broad masses of peasants have increased many times over. 'In times of national and hometown crisis, the hopes of hometown elders and brothers are placed on you. We hope you will fight to safeguard the peaceful lives of our hometown elders and brothers!'"

I want to declare that I am neither a party member nor a cadre, and I have not been instructed by anyone. I am merely speaking on behalf of the farmers to say a few words.

　　向戒严部队表示敬意
    贺兰一农民捐款两万元
    本报银川６月１０日电  宁夏回族自治区贺兰县一位不愿透露姓名的农民，日前寄信给宁夏军区，捐款２万元，要求转给国务院和首都戒严部队的指战员。记者见到了这封原信。
    这位农民在信中说：“我代表广大农民赠给被反革命暴徒打死后摔下崇文门过街桥又放汽油烧的那位战士的家属５０００元，作为安葬费。赠给戒严部队１００００元，作为慰问品费。赠给其他有功人员５０００元。这是富起来的农民的心意。”
    这位农民在信中写道：“戒严部队的官兵们，你们中间的大部分来自（至）农民家庭，你们深深知道十年前农民的生活，而今广大农民生活水平成倍增长。”“在国家、乡亲面临危机时刻，家乡父老兄弟寄予你们无限的希望，盼你们为保卫家乡父老兄弟的生活安宁去战斗！”
    我要声明，我既不是党员，也不是干部，也未受任何人的指使，我只不过是代表农民说上几句话。
