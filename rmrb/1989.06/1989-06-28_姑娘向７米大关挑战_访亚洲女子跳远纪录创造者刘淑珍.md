The Girl Challenges the 7-Meter Mark
—An Interview with Liu Shuzhen, the Record Holder for Women's Long Jump in Asia

“My wish was to break the 7-meter mark in Qingdao, but unfortunately, I didn't perform to my full potential. It's really a pity!” As soon as we met, the straightforward Liu Shuzhen blurted out these words, a mix of joy and regret.

At 23 years old, Liu Shuzhen stands at 1.67 meters tall and weighs 64 kilograms. Her figure is well-proportioned and sturdy, and her eyes are bright and spirited. Born in Tangshan, Hebei, known as the "hometown of track and field" in China, she was lively and energetic from a young age, loving to jump around, almost like a "wild child." After finishing primary school, she entered Tangshan No. 50 Middle School, which also functioned as an amateur sports school, to practice long jump. Her coach, Zhu Fengshu, nurtured this young talent with great care, hoping she would one day bloom beautifully.

In 1984, two admission notices arrived almost simultaneously for Liu Shuzhen: one inviting her to join the provincial sports team, and the other from Hebei University of Traditional Chinese Medicine. For Liu Shuzhen, who had older siblings, going to university was a long-cherished dream. Her parents, like any others, hoped for a college graduate in the family. She tossed and turned, torn between the two choices. Finally, after much thought, she decided to choose the former and joined the team under the guidance of Zhang Changhong, who had just graduated from Beijing Institute of Physical Education.

"The choice was painful and difficult," Coach Zhang interjected emotionally. He was delighted to have such a determined student but couldn't help feeling sorry that she missed the chance to go to university.

After that, Liu Shuzhen trained diligently, improved her techniques, overcame her weaknesses, and for five consecutive years, she gave up her New Year's break. Under her coach's meticulous guidance, her performance steadily improved. Coach Zhang showed a record of her achievements: in 1985, she jumped 5.91 meters, a preliminary test; in 1986, 6.25 meters; in 1987, she improved to 6.52 meters. Finally, last year at the National Track and Field Elite Championship in Shijiazhuang, she showed her prowess, jumping 6.79 meters, breaking the 6.70-meter Asian record held by Wang Zhiwei from Shanghai.

"But I also had a disastrous performance," Liu Shuzhen admitted frankly. It turned out that just half a year later, in September, at an international invitational meet in Tianjin, Sichuan's female athlete Xiong Qiying raised the Asian record by 9 centimeters, while Liu Shuzhen did not perform well and failed to make it into the top three.

Back in Hebei, her coach and she carefully reviewed her experience, identified gaps, and found areas for improvement. She increased her 100-meter speed to 11.25 seconds, and her explosive power also improved, laying a solid foundation for future outstanding performances. In the early June battle in Qingdao, she finally leaped to 6.89 meters, once again breaking the Asian record.

When talking about coming to Qingdao to participate in the National Women's Track and Field Championships, Liu Shuzhen excitedly said, "I am very grateful to the Qingdao audience for their enthusiastic encouragement and applause." Liu Shuzhen expressed her determination to break the 7-meter mark as soon as possible.

　　姑娘向７米大关挑战    
    ——访亚洲女子跳远纪录创造者刘淑珍
    “我的愿望是在青岛破７米大关，结果未发挥尽水平，很可惜！”一见面，性格直爽的刘淑珍就“蹦”出这么一句话，欣喜中有几分遗憾。
    今年２３岁的刘淑珍身高１．６７米，体重６４公斤，身材匀称健壮，一对眼睛明亮有神。她出生在我国“田径之乡”河北唐山，从小活泼好动，喜欢蹦跳，简直是个“疯丫头”。上完小学后进入兼有业余体校性质的唐山第５０中学，练习跳远。朱凤书老师精心地扶植这棵幼苗，期待她将来开出芬芳的花蕾。
    １９８４年，两张录取通知书几乎同时飞到刘淑珍手里，一张召唤她入省体工队，另一张是河北中医学院的入学通知单。上大学对于上有兄姊的刘淑珍来说，真是渴求不已，作父母的谁不盼望家里出个大学生啊。她辗转反侧，陷入矛盾之中。最后经过苦苦思索，毅然挑选了前者，投至刚刚从北京体院毕业的臧长虹麾下。
    “抉择是痛苦而又艰难的。”臧教练动情地插话说。他为有这么一个信念坚定的弟子而欣慰，又不免替她失去上大学的好机会惋惜。
    此后，刘淑珍刻苦训练，改进技术，克服弱点，并连续５年放弃了春节休息，在教练的悉心指导下成绩稳步上升。臧教练出示这样一个成绩表：１９８５年她跳了５．９１米，小试牛刀；１９８６年，６．２５米；１９８７年提高至６．５２米。终于，去年在石家庄全国田径精英赛上，她锋芒毕露，跳出６．７９米的好成绩，打破了上海姑娘王智慧保持的６．７０米的亚洲纪录。
    “但是，我也有惨败的时候。”刘淑珍坦率承认。原来，仅过半年，９月在天津的一次国际邀请赛上，四川女将熊其英又把亚洲纪录提高了９厘米，而刘淑珍发挥不理想，连前３名也未进入。
    回到河北，教练和她认真总结经验，找差距，寻不足。她将百米速度提高到１１秒２５，爆发力也有加强，为以后跳出优异成绩打下基础。今年６月初青岛之战，终于跃出６．８９米，再次刷新亚洲纪录。
    谈到来青岛参加全国女子田径赛，刘淑珍兴奋地说：“我非常感谢青岛观众给我的热情鼓励和掌声。”刘淑珍表示，要早日闯过７米大关。
