Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 1st.

The financial situation in the first quarter has eased. The total foreign exchange reserves are $174.88 billion, and the total external debt is $123.64 billion. There is still a gap with the austerity targets, and the basis for improvement is not very solid.

According to a report from the *Financial Times*, in the first three months of this year, urban and rural savings deposits in China have significantly increased, and the scale of loans has been controlled. The state's gold and foreign exchange reserves are in good condition. The important financial figures for the first quarter of this year, authorized by the *Financial Times* to be published today, indicate that the national financial situation has shown signs of easing recently.

According to statistics from the banking sector, by the end of March, the total deposits absorbed by all banks in the country amounted to 752 billion yuan. Of this, enterprise deposits were 281.6 billion yuan, and urban and rural savings deposits were 349 billion yuan, an increase of 25.53 billion yuan compared to the end of last year. The total circulation of Renminbi was 209.9 billion yuan. In terms of loan conditions, by the end of March, the total loan amount from the state bank was 1053 billion yuan, an increase of 9.5 billion yuan compared to the same period last year. Among the various loans, fixed asset loans were 154.6 billion yuan, agricultural loans were 82.8 billion yuan, loans to industrial production and construction enterprises were 260.7 billion yuan, loans to material supply and commercial enterprises were 457.9 billion yuan, loans to urban collective enterprises were 64 billion yuan, and the total loan amount to individual industrial and commercial households was approximately 2 billion yuan.

In addition, by the end of May, the total deposits absorbed by rural credit cooperatives nationwide were 141.4 billion yuan, of which household savings deposits were 120.5 billion yuan. The total loan amount from rural credit cooperatives was 102.1 billion yuan, of which household loans were 44.1 billion yuan, and township enterprise loans were 49.4 billion yuan. Statistics also show that by the end of March, China's total assets in international financial institutions were 18.52 billion yuan, and the Ministry of Finance's borrowing from banks was 57.646 billion yuan.

Also published today are the figures for China's total gold and foreign exchange reserves and the national external debt balance. By the end of March, China's gold reserves were 12.67 million ounces, the total foreign exchange reserves were $174.88 billion, and the total external debt was $123.64 billion.

A spokesperson for the People's Bank of China said that although the financial situation in the first quarter has eased, there is still a gap with the austerity targets. The basis for continued improvement in the financial situation is not very solid, and the development trend remains uncertain. In China, the shortage of construction funds will be a long-term phenomenon, and mobilizing and absorbing national savings is an important link in economic development and financial stability. The People's Bank and various specialized banks will continue to adhere to the tight policy and will not change the various economic measures taken for rectification, adjustment, and deepening reform.

　　我首季金融形势有所缓和
    外汇储备总额１７４亿美元外债总额１２３亿美元
    与紧缩目标要求还有差距好转基础不很稳固
    本报北京６月１日讯  据金融时报报道，今年头３个月，我国城乡储蓄存款明显上升，贷款规模有所控制，国家黄金、外汇储备情况良好。今天由金融时报受权公布的今年一季度国家信贷收支情况和国家黄金、外汇储备等重要金融数字表明，近来全国金融形势出现缓和迹象。
    据银行部门的有关统计资料，截至３月底，全国各银行吸收各项存款总额为７５２０亿元，其中企业存款为２８１６亿元，城乡储蓄存款额为３４９０亿元，比去年底增加２５５．３亿元。流通中的人民币总额２０９９亿元。从贷款情况看，到３月末，国家银行的贷款总额为１０５３０亿元，比去年同期少增加９５亿元。各项贷款中，固定资产贷款为１５４６亿元，对农业贷款为８２８亿元，对工业生产和建筑企业贷款为２６０７亿元，对物资供销和商业企业贷款为４５７９亿元，对城镇集体企业贷款为６４０亿元，对个体工商户贷款总额约２０亿元。
    此外，至５月底，全国农村信用社吸收存款总额为１４１４亿元，其中农户储蓄存款为１２０５亿元。农村信用社贷款总额为１０２１亿元，其中农户贷款为４４１亿元，乡镇企业贷款为４９４亿元。统计数字还表明，到３月底，我国在国际金融机构的资产总额为１８５．２亿元，财政部门向银行的借款为５７６．４６亿元。
    今天同时公布的金融情况还有我国黄金外汇储备总额和国家对外借款余额。至３月末，我国黄金储备为１２６７万盎斯，国家外汇储备总额为１７４．８８亿美元，国家对外借款总额为１２３．６４亿美元。
    中国人民银行总行新闻发言人在此间表示，一季度金融形势虽有所缓和，但是与紧缩目标的要求还有差距。金融形势继续好转的基础并不很稳固，发展趋势仍不容乐观。在我国，建设资金短缺将是长期现象，动员和吸收国民储蓄是发展经济、稳定金融的重要环节。人民银行和各专业银行将继续坚持从紧方针，为治理整顿、深化改革而采取的各项经济措施都不改变。
