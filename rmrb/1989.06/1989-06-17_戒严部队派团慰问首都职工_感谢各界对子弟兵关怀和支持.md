Today, the martial law troops and troops stationed in Beijing sent a delegation to visit the Beijing Food Company, the Capital Iron and Steel Company, the Beijing Municipal Public Transportation Company, and the Beijing Municipal Public Utilities Bureau. They warmly comforted the broad masses of cadres and workers on the capital's industrial, transportation, public utilities, and financial and commercial fronts who had stood their posts during the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion. They expressed gratitude for the concern and support shown by all quarters to the soldiers.

The delegation leader, Deputy Director of the General Political Department Zhou Wenyan, in his speech, highly praised the capital's working class for their strong support of the troops in executing martial law, and for their important contributions in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion and maintaining the stability of the capital. He said: In the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, you have earnestly studied and understood the spirit of the instructions from the Party Central Committee and the State Council. You have remained politically consistent with the Party Central Committee, and have clearly opposed the counter-revolutionary plots of a few people, fully demonstrating the political character of the working class. You have braved hardships and endured insults and attacks, stood your posts, ensured the normal supply of water, electricity, transportation, and production in the capital, and effectively promoted the restoration and stabilization of social order. You have firmly supported the major decision of the Party Central Committee and the State Council to impose martial law in some areas of Beijing, creating conditions for the martial law troops to carry out their missions. You have laid water pipes, strung electric wires, transported materials, ensured supplies, and with your day-and-night struggles, you have composed song after song in praise of the army, making the officers and soldiers of the martial law troops feel the care and warmth of the capital's people.

During the visit, artists from the People's Liberation Army Music Ensemble and the General Political Department Song and Dance Troupe performed artistic programs for the broad masses of cadres and workers on the capital's industrial, transportation, public utilities, and financial and commercial fronts. Artists from the Capital Iron and Steel Company Art Troupe also performed on stage with the army's artistic soldiers.

The martial law troops and troops stationed in Beijing were accompanied by Beijing Municipal Party Committee and government leaders Zhang Baifa, Huang Chao, and Wu Yi. Wherever they went, they were warmly welcomed by cadres and workers, presenting a moving scene of the army loving the people and the people supporting the army.
