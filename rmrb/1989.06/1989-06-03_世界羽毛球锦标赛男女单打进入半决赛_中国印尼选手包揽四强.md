The women's singles semifinalists are China's Li Lingwei, Tang Jiuhong, Huang Hua, and Indonesia's Sarwendah. The men's singles semifinalists are China's Yang Yang and Indonesia's Sugiarto, Adi, and Liusia.

Tonight's most thrilling match was between 20-year-old Huang Hua and the in-form 18-year-old Indonesian veteran Wang Lianxiang. The first set saw both players tied at 1-1, then 4-4. Huang Hua then took control with aggressive play, combining her powerful smashes with precise net shots. She gradually dominated the court, winning the first set 11-5. In the second set, Huang continued her strong performance, forcing her opponent to retreat and defend, ultimately winning 11-6.

Tang Jiuhong needed only 20 minutes to defeat the Soviet Union's Ribkina, becoming the first to advance to the semifinals. Li Lingwei lost the first set 10-12 but came back strong, winning the next two sets 11-2 and 11-6 to defeat Sweden's "Black Pearl" Magnusson. Indonesia's Sarwendah advanced to the semifinals with a 2-1 victory over the Netherlands' Kuangna.

The men's singles matches were closely contested. Yang Yang defeated Denmark's Bo Larsen 15-11 and 17-15. Zhao Jianhua and Sugiarto were tied 1-1 after two sets. In the third set, Zhao led 14-10 but faltered due to fatigue, losing 15-17. Xiong Guobao fought hard against Liusia but lost 10-15 and 13-15.

Adi defeated his teammate Susanto 2-0 to advance to the semifinals.

The women's doubles, men's doubles, and mixed doubles will also determine their semifinalists tonight.

    世界羽毛球锦标赛男女单打进入半决赛
    中国印尼选手包揽四强
    新华社雅加达6月2日电　（记者梁金雄、周宗欣）第六届世界羽毛球锦标赛男、女单打1／4决赛今天结束。中国队和印度尼西亚队包揽了男、女四强。
    获得女单半决赛权的是中国的李玲蔚、唐九红、黄华和印尼的萨尔文达；中国的杨阳和印尼的苏吉亚托、阿迪、罗天宁获得男单半决赛权。
    今晚女单最为精彩的一场比赛是20岁的黄华同士气正旺的印尼18岁“老将”王莲香。首局，双方从1平战至4平。之后黄华“以毒攻毒”，在与擅长防守的对手展开拉锯战的同时，还多了一手凶狠的劈杀。这样，她逐渐控制了全场，以11∶5先拔头筹。第二局，她继续发挥球路刁和高质量的后场球，使对手退居后场招架，轻松地以11∶6淘汰了对手。
    唐九红今晚仅用20分钟便战胜了苏联的里布金娜，第一个进入半决赛。李玲蔚先以10∶12失利，接着，以11∶2和11∶6连扳两局，战胜了瑞典“黑珍珠”玛格努松。印尼的萨尔文达以2∶1战胜荷兰的库纳进入四强。
    男单比赛水平相当，每一场都很激烈，杨阳以15∶11和17∶15战胜了丹麦的波·拉尔森。赵剑华与苏吉亚托头两局战成1平。第三局，赵剑华曾以14∶10领先，但因体力不支，球路不稳，反以15∶17失利。熊国宝与罗天宁苦斗两局，以10∶15和13∶15败阵。
    阿迪以2∶0胜队友苏桑托后进入半决赛。
    女双、男双和混双今晚也将决出四强。
