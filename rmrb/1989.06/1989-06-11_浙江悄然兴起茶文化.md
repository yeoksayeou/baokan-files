Zhejiang, known as the "City of Famous Teas" in China, is quietly witnessing a resurgence of tea culture.

In recent years, whenever new tea is available, tea farmers from various tea-producing regions in Zhejiang bring their carefully cultivated and meticulously processed local famous teas to participate in tea cultural activities at the provincial, municipal, and county levels. The forms of these activities vary with time, place, and type of tea, including tea competitions, tea evaluations, tea tasting sessions, tea festivals, spring tea banquets, and tea art performances. They invite renowned tea experts and scholars to form a panel of judges, who use secret ballots to determine the winners.

Zhejiang, known as the "Hometown of Tea," is one of the birthplaces of Chinese tea culture. As early as the Southern Song Dynasty, the highest form of ancient Chinese tea culture—tea competitions—were extremely popular in Hangzhou. The famous Japanese "tea ceremony" art evolved and developed on the basis of absorbing the "Jingshan Tea Banquet" from that time in Hangzhou. Since the tea market was opened in 1984, tea culture has rapidly emerged in Zhejiang's tea-producing regions. It is understood that, in addition to cultivating their minds and pursuing the enjoyment of tea art, tea farmers are more focused on developing the commodity economy. They use tea cultural activities to enhance the fame of traditional famous teas, develop and innovate new famous teas, open up tea sales channels, and occupy the tea market.

A tea expert familiar with this field told the reporter: Tea competitions are like a challenge on a stage. Once the results are announced, not only does the champion tea's value increase a hundredfold, but even the top 10 teas see a significant boost in sales. The rich and varied tea cultural activities in Zhejiang's tea-producing regions have also attracted the Taiwan Lu Yu Tea Art Culture Group to perform in Longjing Tea Village in Hangzhou in late May, realizing the first tea culture exchange between the two sides of the Taiwan Strait in 40 years.

　　浙江悄然兴起茶文化
    新华社杭州电  （记者虞云达）我国“名茶之都”浙江省正悄然兴起茶文化。
    近几年，每当新茶应市，浙江各茶区茶农带着辛勤培育精心炒制的地方名茶，参加省、市、县不同层次的茶文化活动，活动形式因时、因地、因茶而异，主要有斗茶会、评茶会、品茗会、茶叶节、迎春茶宴、茶艺演出等等，他们请一些德高望重的茶叶专家、学者组成评委，密码记分决定雌雄。
    “茶叶之乡”浙江省是我国茶文化的发祥地之一，早在南宋，作为我国古代茶文化的最高表现形式——斗茶活动就在杭州盛极一时，著名的日本“茶道”艺术就是在吸收当时杭州“径山茶宴”的基础上演变发展而成的。１９８４年茶叶市场开放以来，浙江茶区迅速兴起了茶文化，据了解，茶农们除修心养性追求茶艺享受之外，更多的是为了发展商品经济的目的，他们借助茶文化活动，提高传统名茶知名度，发展创新名茶，打开茶叶销路，占领茶叶市场。
    一位深谙此道的茶叶行家告诉记者：斗茶好比打擂台，一旦揭晓不仅名茶状元身价百倍，就是前１０位名次的名茶也顿时销路大增。浙江茶区丰富多采的茶文化活动还吸引了海峡对岸的台湾陆羽茶艺文化团专程于５月下旬来杭州龙井茶乡进行茶艺表演，实现了海峡两岸茶人４０年来第一次茶文化交流。
