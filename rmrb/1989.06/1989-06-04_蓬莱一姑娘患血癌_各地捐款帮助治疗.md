A young woman from Penglai County, Shandong Province, suffering from leukemia, has received donations from people across the county and the nation, and her condition has now improved significantly.

The young woman, named Hu Xiaoxia, is a student in the accounting class at Penglai County's Third Vocational High School. She is 18 years old. Last December, she was diagnosed with leukemia and hospitalized in a hospital in Yantai City. To pay for her treatment, her family exhausted their savings and sold part of their property. Unable to afford further medical expenses, they had to bring her home. On March 24, Penglai County Radio Station broadcasted this news, and people from all walks of life in the county spontaneously launched the "Everyone Contributes a Little Love" campaign. From the county magistrate and bureau chiefs down to the elderly in nursing homes and children in kindergartens, everyone enthusiastically donated money to help Hu Xiaoxia. An elderly man in his late seventies left 100 yuan at the radio station and walked away without leaving his name, saying only, "The money is for the child's treatment." A young couple about to get married donated 100 yuan to Hu Xiaoxia. A primary school student donated the coins he had saved over the years. In just five days, the county collected 31,000 yuan in donations. Soon, Hu Xiaoxia returned to the Yantai hospital for treatment. Recently, Central Television broadcasted this news, and donations, letters, medicines, and prescriptions from all over the country poured in to Hu Xiaoxia. Now, she has been introduced to the affiliated hospital of Suzhou Medical College in Jiangsu Province for treatment.

　　蓬莱一姑娘患血癌
    各地捐款帮助治疗
    新华社济南６月４日电（通讯员于丕源、姜福）山东省蓬莱县一位身患血癌的姑娘，得到全县、乃至全国各地人民的捐助，目前病情已接近缓解。
    这位叫胡晓晓的姑娘是蓬莱县第三高级职业中学财会班学生，现年１８岁。去年底，她患血癌住进了烟台市一家医院。为了给她治病，家里花光了多年的积蓄，并变卖了部分家产。因无钱再交医疗费，只好把她接回。今年３月２４日，蓬莱县广播站广播了这一消息后，全县各界群众自发开展“人人献出一点爱”活动，上至县长、局长，下至敬老院的老人和幼儿园的孩童，都踊跃地为胡晓晓治病捐款。一位年近古稀的老大爷到广播站放下１００元就走，当追问他姓名时，他只丢下一句话：“那钱是给孩子治病用的。”一对正准备结婚的青年拿出１００元捐给胡晓晓。一位小学生把自己多年积攒的硬币捐献出来。仅５天时间，全县捐款就达３．１万元。很快，胡晓晓又回到了烟台医院接受治疗。前不久，中央电视台播放了这一消息，全国各地的捐款、信件、药品、药方，纷纷飞到了胡晓晓身边。现在，她经人介绍住进了江苏苏州医学院附属医院。
