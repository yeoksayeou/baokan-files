Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 1st.

The People's Daily published an article titled "Tiananmen Square, I Weep for You" today. The full text is as follows:

The People's Daily Editor's Note: We urge students who are still staying in Tiananmen Square and all those who care about the current social order in the capital to read this article. The author is a third-year student from a normal university in a certain province. Over the past month, he has come to Beijing twice. However, after reflecting on the situation in the square, he decided to leave. Before his departure, he went to the municipal government's petition reception office and left this article. At his request, his name has been omitted.

I am a student from an out-of-town university. I have been in Beijing for several days. After arriving, I have been eating and sleeping in Tiananmen Square. I have not, like other students, hoarsely shouted to the onlookers about "Reuters News" or told stories and reasons that I myself do not fully believe, but have calmly thought and observed. I am well aware that once a person is controlled by a certain emotion, he will lose his ability to judge fairly. Now, I will introduce to the domestic and international compatriots who are concerned about us the situation I have heard and seen over this period.

First, everyone has a sense of being deceived.

Before coming to Beijing, students who had returned from Beijing told us how the Beijing residents supported the students, how individual businessmen would casually throw out hundreds of yuan in cash without leaving their names; how the railway passenger transport department would wink at students boarding trains without tickets to come to Beijing to support them; how after arriving in Beijing, food and clothing would not be a problem, with free supplies, and truly, what's not to enjoy in touring Beijing? Such a big event, if you don't go to see it, you will regret it for life, etc. We were moved by these words and came to Beijing. After a day or two of "practice," most students felt deceived and returned to their schools or even went home. It turned out that the situation was not as described by those who had been to Beijing. Some students who returned from Beijing took a temporary and local phenomenon as the whole picture. We found that Beijing residents no longer supported the students selflessly as they did before. On the contrary, some street vendors took the opportunity to raise the prices of food, mainly snacks and drinks, to dig into our already meager pockets. The Beijing tourism map, priced at 0.35 yuan, some people dared to sell it to us for one yuan per copy. And we, being unfamiliar with the place, could only dare to be angry but not dare to speak. In Beijing, you have to pay for every move. A subway ride costs three jiao for a ticket, and even one fen less is not acceptable, so we might as well ride around the city a couple of times for the wind; taking a bus, sometimes for five fen, you still have to explain to the ticket seller with a red face for half a day; at night, sleeping in the underground passageways, some students sleep on the square, wrapped in old clothes; eating is just to fill the stomach, one meal a day, usually two meals of dry bread, of course, you can't eat your fill, sometimes you have to sing an empty city strategy. The conditions are harsh, can be described as eating and sleeping in the wind. Of course, we know that coming to Beijing is not for enjoyment, but there should be a clear purpose, yet most students do not know what the clear purpose is, just want to come and support. As a result, the grand support turned into a farce that is neither support nor tourism.

Second, the mentality of university students in Tiananmen Square.

Currently, the mentality of university students in Tiananmen Square is quite complex.

Some students came to escape the burden of schoolwork. Long-term confinement within four walls makes one feel bored, irritated, and bored, coupled with the prevalence of anti-study sentiments, so they took the opportunity to come to Beijing for a trip to relax their nerves. However, what about the future? The burden of schoolwork can only be postponed and accumulated but cannot be fundamentally eliminated. What to do in the future? Once thought of, it becomes very anxious, falling into a dilemma.

Some students came to Beijing to play. Now is a good time to come to Beijing, with little expense, because eating and sleeping are not too worrying, fortunately, we are all young, and we can endure it. Some students plan to go to a certain place on a certain day, and even plan the bus routes, preparing to visit all the famous scenic spots. This part of the students does not want to withdraw from Tiananmen Square because they can have a "nest" to return to after a day of sightseeing. The reason is simple, now everyone is eating and sleeping on the square, because it is an extraordinary time, no one looks down on anyone. If there is another chance to come to Beijing in the future, as a face-conscious little intellectual, who still dares to do so on the square?

Another part of the students came to Beijing to fulfill their wishes. Because no one knows how many such opportunities one can encounter in a lifetime, missing such an opportunity is very regrettable, and one may regret it for life. While hurriedly boarding the train to Beijing, anyway, no matter sweet or bitter, just leave a memory in the heart.

There is also a part of the students, generally "representatives" of various schools or leaders of various organizations, of course, they do not want to withdraw easily. In addition, a few students are because they usually do not have an opportunity to show their talents and talents, this time they finally caught such an opportunity to show themselves, of course, they will not easily give up. Because here there is no danger, after all, the army is not used to deal with students, and the party and the government also want to firmly protect their patriotic enthusiasm, so they become more and more fearless, and their courage becomes bigger and bigger, naming and cursing certain leaders, with the flavor of "dung on the former nobles."

Third, a general view of Tiananmen Square.

Before coming to Beijing, I had a great admiration for Beijing—the capital of the People's Republic of China. Tiananmen Gate Tower and Tiananmen Square are the "holy land" in my heart. But now, looking at it, I am very disappointed, I can't describe the feeling in my heart. The people and things on the square have all become strange and unrecognizable.

The wide East and West Chang'an Streets in front of Tiananmen Gate are far from the orderly traffic we imagined, but rather chaotic. People cross the barriers and weave through the vehicle lanes, and the screeching sound of brakes is often heard. Once there is a parade or demonstration, traffic is immediately blocked; some speakers start giving speeches on the side of the road, and a crowd of people gather around, and the traffic dilemma immediately appears. On the road in front of the Museum of Chinese History, because there is a temporary toilet next to it, people do not pay attention to urinating and defecating, and excrement flows into the tree pits by the road and even onto the road. When the weather is hot, the smell of excrement rushes to the sky, and people have to cover their noses to pass by.

It is worth mentioning that in front of the toilet, some street vendors set up food stalls, selling watermelons, ice cream, soda, skewered lamb, and egg rolls, etc., and these stalls are always surrounded by a group of students who no longer care about hygiene. Now, the vast Tiananmen Square has become a large garbage dump. I met many students who said that some students have not washed their faces, brushed their teeth, or washed their feet for ten days. Is it because there are no conditions? No. The simple water pipes around Tiananmen Square are always supplying water, it's just that some students are too lazy. At night, they just crawl into the various tents, lie down together with their feet and heads touching, with foot odor, sweat odor, and bad breath mixed with the smell of spoiled food, all kinds of odors mixed together. Some students throw away the bottles after drinking beverages, throw away the packaging after eating pickled vegetables, bread crumbs, vegetable scraps, and rice grains fall on the sleeping cotton and old clothes, after eating, they either sleep or look for some excitement to pass the time, there are those who cheer, those who joke and play, those who talk about love, and those who gather to play cards. At night, they raise their hoarse throats to sing a few lines of northern and southern dialects, thirsty and drink a belly full of tap water around the square, or argue fiercely with street vendors, making trouble. Look, all this constitutes the life picture of university students on our square. What is even more infuriating is that the Monument to the People's Heroes is also covered with many slogans and garbage in patches. What is most unbearable to the eye is the lawn around the square. The expensive lawn should be green now, but now it is trampled so that even the roots of the grass are not visible. These scenes, I believe, will make people who come to Beijing now and Beijing residents sad.

Fourth, we should withdraw from Tiananmen Square.

After a few days of extensive contact with my fellow students, many of them think we should withdraw from Tiananmen Square. There are many reasons, now I summarize these reasons as follows:

First, our purpose has been achieved, and there is no need to stay any longer. In the early stage of the student movement, we demanded the punishment of corrupt officials and the elimination of corruption, which has resonated with the people of the whole country and the world, and has also attracted the high attention of the Party and the government. Party and state leaders have successively expressed their opinions and met with student representatives. Next, it should be the Party and the government taking measures to implement our demands. However, if we insist on not withdrawing, it will inevitably divert the Party and the government's attention and focus on taking measures. Therefore, we should stop while we are ahead, prevent the situation from escalating, and withdraw voluntarily, which is a wise move. Otherwise, our high demands will not be realized, and it will also affect the realization of our low goals. The implementation of democracy and freedom also has a process and is not something that can be achieved overnight. This we must understand. If the situation develops, it will lead to a situation that we cannot predict, uncontrollable, and that everyone does not want to see.

Second, we should not disturb the Beijing residents any longer. Beijing residents indeed gave us great support in the early stage of the student movement. However, with the passage of time, Beijing residents also have a tolerance problem. Especially now, the goals and directions of the student movement have shifted and are quite volatile. Not to mention that Beijing residents have changed from understanding to being at a loss, even we ourselves sometimes do not know what we are talking about. In addition, some of our students' uncivilized behavior in Beijing, such as spitting on the ground, evading fares on public transportation, not maintaining hygiene, hurting people with words, arbitrarily stopping cars, etc., has already made some Beijing residents have opinions, and some residents' good feelings towards university students have become cold. Now, Beijing residents who send meals and water have become quite rare or even disappeared, which shows this point. Do we have to wait until Beijing residents are disgusted and drive us away? It can be said that this student movement has caused a relatively large psychological impact on Beijing residents, and even if there is another student movement in the future, they will not support us like this.

Third, the behavior of a few Beijing residents and a few Beijing university students is thought-provoking. It is undeniable that the vast majority of Beijing residents are kind and hospitable, but there are also a few Beijing residents whose behavior is disappointing. A fellow student told me that he had encountered the same question from the same Beijing resident in three different places, and it turned out that this resident did not recognize the fellow student. Looking at the smiling face, the fellow student felt angry after eating. Some Beijing people have a strong curiosity, and if the out-of-town university students do not withdraw from the square, they will come to satisfy their curiosity after dinner in the cool evening breeze, wandering around, looking at us university students daring to shout and curse anyone, and they are quite happy, treating us like artworks to be played with and appreciated, as if they were watching a circus. A few Beijing university students planted flags on the square, but they themselves disappeared somewhere, went home or to school to sleep when it was hot, and came to the square for a walk when it was cool, making some high-sounding remarks, making us out-of-town university students feel inferior. These people, although not many, have hurt our feelings, and we out-of-town university students all have a feeling of being played with.

Fourth, the organizers of this student movement have poor quality and are not qualified to continue leading us in the student movement. The original organizers have retired for unknown reasons, and the later organizers have poor quality, and their behavior is disgusting. They are mysterious and make people confused, and each one is an untouchable and unapproachable "general in charge" and "head," and the organizational structure is overlapping, with no one serving anyone. It is understood that there are at least four or five relatively large parallel organizations on the square, and many other organizations with various names, with orders coming from multiple sources, and the loudspeakers interfere with each other. On the one hand, they shout the slogan of "overthrowing corrupt officials," on the other hand, they look at their fellow students with cold eyes and a harsh voice. A fellow student once saw an organizer issue a blank receipt to the supply station to receive a large number of bread, eggs, beverages, and pickled vegetables, and a few people could not finish eating and threw them away. Meanwhile, many out-of-town university students could not eat or could not eat their fill. We saw the organizers on the Monument to the People's Heroes eating and drinking, casually discarding food and beverages. They should publish the income and expenditure of donations and donated items every day and let all fellow students supervise. What is even more outrageous is that they dare to hug a girl and laugh under the Monument to the People's Heroes, on the white marble pedestal. Such organizers, how can we out-of-town university students respect them?

Fifth, the situation on Tiananmen Square has developed in a direction opposite to the original intention, and there are indeed a few people fanning the flames. As educated intellectuals, we should not be deceived. There are so many rumors on the square that one cannot keep up with them, but after calm thinking, they are all groundless. Before coming to Beijing, rumors spread everywhere about how the government cut off the water and lighting in Tiananmen Square, released tear gas, and how the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Shanghai did not recognize the current government, and how armed helicopters suppressed students, etc. After coming to Beijing, we found that all this is nonsense. Putting malicious imaginations on the wings of rumors and imposing them on the Party and the government. When we understand the truth, we feel very angry. Speaking and acting should be reasonable and moderate, why do a few people spread rumors and confuse people's minds? What is the purpose? There are also a few people who, out of one-sided understanding and narrow-minded thinking, speak ill of the Party and the government, using shouting and cursing to gain cheap applause from the onlookers. We do not even understand why the Party and the government would allow such an abnormal situation to continue? A few students have been controlled by irrational and unreasonable emotions, and if it continues, these fellow students' nerves will collapse, why not send them to the hospital for treatment? It should be emphasized that the patriotic enthusiasm of the vast number of university students is precious and must be acknowledged. However, there are indeed a few university students whose motives are not pure, and we are also very disgusted.

Sixth, various local universities have started classes again, and if we delay any longer, it will not be beneficial to us, and the school will seriously deal with us according to school rules and regulations, or according to special regulations for extraordinary times, and this is something we cannot afford. Now, students are most afraid of being expelled, because once expelled, they are no longer students and become unemployed, and their backbone will not be straight.

In summary, most students have already left Beijing and returned to school. They have started to restore normal teaching order. Therefore, I advise the university students on the square to withdraw and not to let the overloaded Beijing people think we are "staying" here and not leaving. Let those who want to make trouble stay, we out-of-town university students do not want to be used as a tool! A few students want the government to send people to take them away so that they can have a way down and can explain when they return. This idea is naive. If it causes general dislike and resentment, I ask those fellow students with "firm beliefs" at that time, how will they end up? We do not need to talk about the political and economic losses that our actions have brought to the country and the government. I ask university students—my peers—to respect, love, and cherish themselves and not to do things that are detrimental to national dignity and personal dignity.

　　《北京日报》发表一位外地大学生离京时的反思文章
    天安门广场啊，我为你哭泣
    新华社北京６月１日电  《北京日报》今天发表一篇题为“天安门广场啊，我为你哭泣”的文章，全文如下：
    《北京日报》编者按　请至今仍留在天安门广场的学生以及所有关心当前首都社会秩序的人们，都来读读这篇文章。文章的作者是某省师范大学三年级学生，一个月来曾两次进京。然而面对广场上的现状，经过反思，他决定离去。临行前，他前往市政府信访接待站，留下了这篇文章。应本人要求，略去姓名。
　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　
    我是一名外地大学生，来北京已好几天了。到京后，吃住都在天安门广场，我没有像其他同学那样嘶哑着嗓子给围观群众讲述“路透社消息”，说些连自己都不太相信的传闻和道理，而是冷静地思考和观察。我深知，一旦人被某种情绪所支配，那么他将失去公正的判别力。现在，我就把这一段时间耳闻目睹的情况向关注我们的海内外同胞作一介绍。
    一、大家有一种受骗的感觉
    没来北京前，从北京返回的同学告诉我们说，北京市民如何如何支持学生，个体户一甩手便是数十张票额百元的人民币，而且不留名姓；铁路客运部门如何睁一只眼闭一只眼，暗中怂恿学生无票上车进京声援；到北京后吃穿如何不用愁，免费供应，真是这样游览北京何乐而不为；这么一件大事不去看看将会留下终生的遗憾和后悔，等等。我们便被说动了心，到了北京。经过一两天的“实践”后，大多数同学都有一种受骗后的感觉，便又打轿回府，返回学校或顺便回了家。原来，情形并不像那些到北京的同学所说的那样。一些从京返回的同学把一时一地的现象当成整体形象了。我们发现，北京市民已不像前些日子那样无私无偿地支援学生了。相反，一些小摊小贩乘机抬高食品的价格，主要是风味小吃和饮料，来抠我们本已羞涩的腰包。北京市旅游图，定价０．３５元，有些人竟敢对傻乎乎的我们卖到一元一张。而我们因人生地不熟，只有敢怒而不敢言的份。在北京抬手动脚就得掏钱。乘地铁三角一张票，少一分也不行，索性我们乘上后就环城绕上两圈兜兜风；坐公共汽车，有时为五分钱还得满脸通红地给人家售票员解释上半天；晚上睡在地下道里，也有一些同学睡在广场上，围裹四周的是破旧的衣服；吃饭只好饱一顿、饥一顿凑合，一天一般两顿饭，顿顿干面包，当然吃不饱了，有时只好唱唱空城计。条件艰苦，可谓风餐露宿。当然，我们知道来京并不是为了享福，可得有个明确目的呀，然而大多数同学并不知道什么明确目的，只是想来声援一下。结果轰轰烈烈的声援变成了一场既不像声援，又不像旅游的闹剧了。
    二、广场上大学生的心态
    目前，天安门广场的大学生心态十分复杂。
    一部分同学是为了逃避学校功课的负担而来的。长期呆在封闭的四堵墙里，感到苦闷、烦躁、无聊，加上厌学风盛行，因而乘机来京一趟，借以松弛一下神经。然而，未来呢？功课的负担只能往后推移和累积，但不能从根本上取消。将来怎么办？一想起来便十分心焦，陷入矛盾之中。
    有一部分同学是来北京游玩的。现在这个时候来北京，花费很少，因为吃的睡的不是太发愁的事，好在我们都年轻，顶一顶也就过去了。有的同学拟定计划某日去某个地方，而且把乘车路线也都规划好，准备把名胜古迹逛个够。这部分同学不愿撤离天安门广场，是因为白天游玩回来后能有个“窝”，把天安门广场作为“根据地”。原因很简单，现在大家都在广场上吃呀睡的，因为是非常时期，谁也不寒碜谁。如果以后再有机会来北京，作为一个重面子的小知识分子，谁还好意思在广场上这么着？
    另有一部分同学是来北京满足心愿的。因为谁也不知道一生中能遇到几次这样的机会，觉得错过这么一次机会十分可惜，说不定会后悔一辈子。而匆忙之中踏上赴京列车，反正甭管它酸甜苦辣，留个心中的纪念而已。
    还有一部分同学，一般是各个学校的“代表”或各个组织的负责人，当然不愿轻易撤离。此外，少数同学是因为平时没有一个发挥才干、显露才华的机会和场所，这次好不容易抓住这么一个表现自我的机会，当然不会轻易放弃。因为在这里没有什么危险，反正军队不是用来对付学生的，党和政府又要坚决保护其爱国热情，因而愈发有恃无恐，胆子变得越来越大，指名道姓地痛骂某些领导人，大有“粪土当年万户侯”之味。
    三、天安门广场概览
    没有来到北京前，对北京——中华人民共和国的首都心中是十分景仰的，天安门城楼及天安门广场是心中的“圣地”。可现在一看，令人十分失望，说不出心里是个什么滋味。广场上的人和物都变得陌生，面目全非了。
    天安门前宽阔的东西长安街，交通秩序远非我们想象得那样井然有序，而是有些凌乱。人们跨越栏杆，在车行道上穿梭，刺耳的刹车声不时响起。一有游行示威活动，交通即被堵塞；一些演讲者在马路边就开始发表演说，一大堆人群围拢来，交通的窘境便立刻显现出来。在博物馆前的马路上，因为旁边有一简易厕所，人们大小便不注意，粪便涌到路边的树坑里甚至马路上。天气一热，粪便气味直冲云天，令人掩鼻而过。
    值得一提的是，就在厕所前边，一些小摊小贩摆起了食品摊，卖起了西瓜、冰糕、汽水、羊肉串及蛋卷面包等，而这些摊点前总是围着一群已顾不得卫生的大学生们。现在偌大的一个天安门广场，已变成一个大垃圾场。我遇见不少同学，他们说有的同学已有十来天时间不洗脸、不刷牙、不洗脚了。是没有这个条件吗？不是。天安门广场周围简易水管无时不在供水，实在是有些同学太懒了。晚上便在那五花八门的帐篷里一钻，在旧衣服堆里头脚相挨地躺在一起，脚臭、汗臭、口臭加上一些食物变馊发臭，诸种臭味混杂一起。一些同学喝完饮料后随手把瓶一扔，吃完榨菜后把包装纸扔在脚边，面包屑、菜渣、米饭粒纷纷落在睡的棉絮旧衣上，吃完饭后不是睡觉，便是寻找点刺激来打发日子，起哄者有之，嘻笑打闹者有之，谈情说爱者也不乏其人，还有围在一起打扑克的。到了晚上则扯起嘶哑的喉咙吼上一段南腔北调，渴了则灌上一肚子广场周围的自来水，或者与小摊小贩脸红脖子粗地去斤斤计较，胡搅蛮缠。看，这一切便构成了我们广场上大学生的生活图画。令人气愤的是，人民英雄纪念碑上也涂贴了不少标语口号，垃圾成片。最令人目不忍睹的是广场及其周围的草坪。造价昂贵的草坪如今该是绿茵如碧了，可现在踩得连草根也都不见踪影了。这些情形，想必现在来到北京的人和北京市民都会黯然神伤的。
    四、我们应该撤离天安门广场
    我经过几天广泛地和同学接触，不少同学认为我们应该撤离天安门广场。理由很多，现在我把这些理由归纳一下：
    第一，我们的目的已经达到，没有必要再呆下去了。学潮的前期，我们要求惩治官倒，铲除腐败，这些已引起全国人民和全世界的共鸣和关注，也引起党和政府的高度重视，党和国家领导人已先后表态和会见过学生代表，接下来该是党和政府采取措施实施我们的要求了。可是如果我们一味坚持不撤，势必会分散党和国家采取措施的注意力和集中力。因此我们适可而止，防止事态扩大，主动撤离，可谓明智之举。否则，我们的高要求得不到落实，也影响了我们的低目标的实现。民主和自由的实施，也有一个过程，决不是一蹴而就的事。这一点我们必须明白。事态发展下去，将会出现我们所无法预料的，不可控制的，同时大家又不愿看到的局面。
    第二，我们不宜再打扰北京市民了。北京人民在学潮前期确实给了我们极大的支持。但是随着时间的推移，北京市民也有个承受力问题。尤其是现在学潮的目标和方向已发生转移而且十分波动。不要说北京市民已由理解变为茫然无措了，连我们自己有时也不知所云了。加之我们一些同学在北京的不文明行为，如随地吐痰、乘车逃票、不讲卫生、出口伤人、随意拦车等等，已使北京一些市民产生看法，一些市民对大学生的好感已经变得冷淡。现在送饭送水的北京市民已相当稀少乃至绝迹，正说明了这一点。难道我们非要等引起北京市民的反感和讨厌，把我们赶走不成？可以说，这次学潮给北京市民造成了较大的心理负作用，以后即使再有学潮，他们也不会如此支持我们了。
    第三，北京少数市民和北京的少数大学生的行为令人深思。无庸讳言，北京的绝大多数市民是善良而好客的，但也有极少数北京市民的所作所为令人失望。一位同学告诉我，他曾在三个不同的地方遇到同一个北京市民所问的同一个问题，原来这位市民没认出这位同学。看那笑眯眯的样子，吃饭后没事寻大学生开心的样子，真令人生气。有的北京人好奇心特强，外地大学生不撤离广场，他们便在晚饭后凉风习习时来满足一下好奇心，转悠来转悠去，看一看我们大学生什么都敢喊，谁也能骂，倒也十分开心，把我们当作艺术品一般把玩欣赏，仿佛是在看一场马戏似的。北京的少数大学生把旗子插在广场上，人却不知溜到哪儿去了，天热了回家里或去学校睡觉，天凉了才到广场遛一圈，发表些高论，令我们外地大学生自愧弗如，他们吃得饱，穿得净，可苦熬了我们这些外地大学生。这些人虽然不多，但却伤害了我们的感情，我们外地大学生都有一种被耍弄了的感觉。
    第四，这次学潮的组织者素质较差，不足以继续领导我们进行学运。原来的组织者们不知因为什么原因相继退出，后来的这些组织者们素质较差，其所作所为令人作呕。他们故弄玄虚，作神秘状，让人摸不着头脑，每一位都是碰不得、惹不起的“总负责人”、“总头头”，而且组织机构叠出，谁也不服气谁。据了解，广场上至少有四五个较大的平行组织，还有名目繁多的其它组织，令出多门，喇叭之间也互相干扰。他们一方面喊着打倒“官倒”的口号，另一方面却又对同学横眉冷目，恶声恶气。有一位同学，曾亲眼看到有一位组织者开张白条到物资供应站领取大量的面包、鸡蛋、饮料和榨菜，几个人吃不完后便白白扔掉。可与此同时，外地不少大学生却吃不上或吃不饱。我们看到在纪念碑上的组织者大吃大嚼，随意丢弃食品饮料。他们应每天公布捐款和捐赠物品的收支情况，让全体同学监督。更有甚者，竟敢在人民英雄纪念碑下，洁白的汉白玉台柱上，搂抱着姑娘嘻笑。这样的组织者如何令我们外地大学生心服？
    第五，天安门广场上事态发展已走向与原来愿望相背离的方面，确有少数人在煽风点火。作为受着高等教育的知识分子，不应受到蒙蔽。广场上流短飞长，令人目不暇给，可经过冷静一想，纯属子虚乌有。没来北京前，到处流传着什么政府断绝天安门广场供水和照明，施放催泪瓦斯，外交部和上海等不承认现政府，武装直升飞机如何如何镇压学生等等，到北京后方知这一切都是一派胡言。把一些恶毒的想象装上流言的翅膀强加到党和政府头上。当我们明白事情真相后，感到十分气愤。说话办事要做到有理有节，少数人为什么要造谣惑众，扰乱人心？究竟出于什么目的？更有少数人出于片面的理解、偏狭的思维把党和政府说得一无是处，用狂呼乱骂的形式博得围观人群廉价的掌声。我们甚至不明白，党和政府怎么会容忍这种不正常情况继续存在？少数学生已被狂热和无理智的情绪所支配，发展下去，这些同学的神经会崩溃，为什么不把他们送往医院加以治疗？应该着重指出的是，广大学生的爱国热情难能可贵，这是必须予以承认的。但是，确有极少数大学生目的动机并不纯正，我们也十分反感。
    第六，各地高校陆续开始复课，耽误下去究竟于己不利，校方认真起来根据校规校纪处分，或者根据非常时期的特殊规定制裁，这可是吃不了要兜着走的。现在学生最怕开除，因为一旦除名便不是学生，成了无业之民，腰杆就不硬了。
    综观这些情况，大多数同学已经离京返校。开始恢复正常的教学秩序。因此我奉劝广场上的大学生们应予撤离，不要让已经超负荷的北京人民认为我们是“赖”在这儿不走。谁愿意闹就让他呆下去吧，我们外地大学生可不要被人当成枪杆使！少数同学想等政府派人来架走自己以便有个台阶下，回去好交代。这种想法是幼稚的。如果引起人们普遍讨厌和反感，请问那些具有“坚定信念”的同学到那时又该如何收场？我们不必说因我们的行动已给国家、给政府所带来的政治、经济上的损失了。请大学生们——我的同龄人自尊自重自爱，不要再做那些有损于国格、有损于自己的事了。
