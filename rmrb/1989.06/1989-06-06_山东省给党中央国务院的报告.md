Report from Shandong Province to the Party Central Committee and the State Council

CPC Central Committee, State Council:

On the night of June 3 to the early morning of June 4, news was broadcast about a few rioters creating a counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing and the People's Liberation Army's imposition of martial law to suppress it. The responsible comrades of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government immediately held an emergency meeting. Based on the development of the situation and the conditions in our province, they studied specific measures to prevent riots and stabilize the situation. On the morning of June 5, the Provincial Party Committee held an expanded meeting of the Standing Committee. They seriously listened to and studied the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Entire Nation" issued by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. Comrade Jiang Chunyun, Secretary of the Provincial Party Committee, presided over the meeting. The main responsible comrades of the Provincial Advisory Committee, Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, Provincial People's Congress, Provincial Government, Provincial Political Consultative Conference, and the central committee members, members of the Central Advisory Committee, and members of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission who were in Jinan participated in the meeting. Everyone expressed great indignation at the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing. They unanimously expressed their firm support for the CPC Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission's wise decision to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and extended warm regards and respect to the brave soldiers and police officers of the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the public security police who participated in the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion. This decision represents the fundamental interests of the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the entire nation, reflecting the wishes and demands of the broad masses of the people. The 3.8 million Communist Party members and 80 million people of Shandong, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, actively respond to the call of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, and maintain a high degree of unity with the Party Central Committee in politics, ideology, and action. They are urgently mobilized to defend the Party, the country, and socialism, and to resolutely fight against a small handful of counter-revolutionaries who attempt to overthrow the Party and socialism. We firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, the broad masses of Communist Party members, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, and the people will unite and fight to achieve a complete victory in this struggle. The attendees at the meeting expressed their determination to follow the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions, actively do a good job in all aspects, and make due contributions to the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion and the stabilization of the situation. Please rest assured, Party Central Committee and State Council.

The meeting studied the measures for implementing the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Entire Nation" by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council, and decided to immediately issue an emergency notice to all cities, counties, and departments, and make specific arrangements.

1. Organize the broad masses of Party members and cadres to seriously study and discuss the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Entire Nation" and other related documents and articles issued by the CPC Central Committee and the State Council. Conduct strong ideological and political work to unify the thoughts and actions of the Party and the people. All Party committees, Party groups, and branches must hold meetings to study and discuss, understand the spirit of the Central Committee's instructions, closely link them with reality, unify their thoughts, and express their attitudes. The core leadership and fighting fortress role of the Party organization and the vanguard and exemplary role of Party members must be fully utilized to unite, educate, and lead the broad masses of the people to fight against the rebellion and stabilize the situation.

2. Actively and proactively do a good job with the work of college students, restoring and maintaining normal teaching order. Given that some students do not understand the facts and have resistance, efforts should be concentrated on educational guidance work. They should be guided to recognize the essence and serious consequences of the counter-revolutionary rebellion created by a few rioters in Beijing, consciously draw a clear line with the counter-revolutionary rebellion, do not listen to, believe, or spread rumors, do not be deceived, do not participate in activities that harm stability and unity, and insist on returning to class and studying. The Party and Youth League organizations and administrative leaders of the schools should do this, as should the teachers, counselors, and student cadres. The parents of the students and various sectors of society should also be mobilized to do this.

3. Strengthen the security of key and vital departments and transportation routes. Administrative, educational, and legal measures should be comprehensively adopted to prevent bad elements from taking advantage of the situation to cause trouble and ensure social stability and the smooth flow of transportation. At the same time, great attention should be paid to stabilizing institutions, streets, and enterprises and public institutions, maintaining normal work order, production order, and living order.

4. Do a good job of publicity and propaganda. At present, newspapers, radio stations, and television stations in the entire province should concentrate on propagating the spirit of the instructions of the Central Committee and the State Council, propagating the actual actions of various levels, departments, and units in implementing the instructions of the Central Committee and the State Council, and propagating the strong voice of the broad masses of the people demanding the cessation of the rebellion and the stabilization of the situation, forming a powerful public opinion.

5. Strictly distinguish and correctly handle two different types of contradictions. Fully recognize the complexity of this struggle, and in the work, resolutely act according to the Party's policy, strictly distinguish the patriotic enthusiasm of the broad masses of students from the counter-revolutionary rebellion created by a small handful of rioters. For the few who engage in beating, smashing, looting, arson, and killing, they must be resolutely struck down by law without mercy. At the same time, do a good job of uniting and educating the majority. In the work, both dare to grasp and manage, take responsibility boldly, and pay attention to methods and means, avoiding the escalation of contradictions.

6. Strengthen the leadership of this struggle. The province and all levels of Party and government should regard the implementation of the instructions of the Central Committee and the State Council, the cessation of turmoil, the suppression of the rebellion, and the stabilization of the situation as the top priority. All levels, industries, and units should implement the responsibility system for leaders. The role of people's congresses, governments, political consultative conferences, and mass organizations such as the Federation of Trade Unions, the Communist Youth League, and the Women's Federation, as well as the militia organizations at all levels, should be fully utilized. At the same time, the current economic work should be grasped to ensure the victory of various planned targets.

　　山东省给党中央国务院的报告
    山东省委、省政府学习党中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》向党中央、国务院的报告中共中央、国务院：
    ６月３日晚至４日凌晨，北京发生极少数暴徒制造反革命暴乱和人民解放军戒严部队采取果断措施予以平息的消息播放后，省委、省政府负责同志即召开紧急会议，根据事态的发展和我省的情况，研究了防止暴乱、稳定局势的具体措施。６月５日上午，省委召开常委扩大会议，认真收听学习了中共中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》。省委书记姜春云同志主持会议，省顾委、省纪委、省人大、省政府、省政协的主要负责同志和在济南的中央委员、中顾委委员、中纪委委员参加了会议。大家对北京发生的反革命暴乱，表示极大的愤慨。一致表示，坚决拥护党中央、国务院、中央军委关于平息反革命暴乱的英明决策，并向参加平息反革命暴乱战斗的英勇的解放军指战员、武警部队指战员、公安干警表示亲切的慰问和敬意。这一决策代表了全党全军和全国人民的根本利益，反映了广大人民群众的愿望和要求。具有光荣革命传统的山东３８０万共产党员和８０００万人民，积极响应党中央、国务院的号召，同党中央在政治上、思想上、行动上保持高度一致，紧急动员起来，为保卫党、保卫国家、保卫社会主义，旗帜鲜明地同妄图颠覆党、颠覆社会主义的一小撮反革命分子进行坚决的斗争。我们坚信，在党中央、国务院的正确领导下，全国广大共产党员、人民解放军指战员和人民群众团结战斗，一定能够取得这场斗争的彻底胜利。与会同志表示，一定按照中央的指示精神，主动做好各方面的工作，为平息反革命暴乱、稳定局势，做出应有的贡献，请党中央、国务院放心。
    会议研究了我省贯彻中共中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》的措施，确定立即向各市地县、各部门发出紧急通知，作出具体部署。
    一、组织广大党员和干部群众认真学习讨论中共中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》和其它有关文件、文章，开展强有力的思想政治工作，统一党内外的思想认识和行动。所有党委、党组和支部，都要召开会议，进行学习讨论，领会中央指示精神，密切联系实际，统一认识，表明态度。要充分发挥党组织的核心领导、战斗堡垒作用和党员的先锋模范作用，团结、教育、带领广大群众为反对暴乱、稳定局势而奋斗。
    二、积极主动地做好高等院校学生的工作，恢复和维护正常的教学秩序。鉴于部分学生不明事实真相，有抵触情绪，要集中力量做好教育疏导工作，引导他们认清北京极少数暴徒制造反革命暴乱的实质和严重后果，自觉地划清同反革命暴乱的界线，做到不听不信不传播谣言，不上当受骗，不参与危害安定团结的活动，坚持复课学习。对学生的工作，学校的党团组织和行政领导要做，教师、辅导员和学生骨干要做，还要动员学生家长和社会各界共同去做。
    三、切实加强重点要害部门和交通要道的安全保卫。要采取行政的、教育的和法制的综合措施，防止坏人乘机破坏捣乱，确保社会安定和交通线路的畅通。同时，要十分重视稳定机关、稳定街道、稳定企事业单位，保持正常的工作秩序、生产秩序和生活秩序。
    四、大力做好舆论宣传工作。当前，全省的报纸、电台、电视台等新闻宣传单位，要集中宣传中央、国务院的指示精神，宣传各级各部门各单位贯彻中央、国务院指示的实际行动，宣传广大人民群众要求制止暴乱、稳定局势的强烈呼声，形成强大的舆论。
    五、严格区分、正确处理两种不同性质的矛盾。充分认识这场斗争的复杂性，在工作中坚决按党的政策办事，把广大学生的爱国热情同一小撮暴徒制造反革命暴乱严格区别开来。对极少数搞打砸抢烧杀的坏人，要依法坚决打击，决不手软。同时，做好团结教育大多数的工作。在工作中，既要敢抓敢管，大胆负责，又要讲究方式方法，避免激化矛盾。
    六、加强对这场斗争的领导。省和各级党政都要把贯彻中央、国务院的指示，制止动乱、平息暴乱、稳定局势，当作头等大事来抓。各级各行各业各单位都要落实领导负责制。要充分发挥各级人大、政府、政协、工青妇等群众团体和民兵组织的作用。同时，要抓好当前的经济工作，确保各项计划指标的胜利实现。
