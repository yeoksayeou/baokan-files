The Central Advisory Commission of the Communist Party of China held its fourth plenary session and resolutely responded to the call of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee, fully supporting the work of the new leadership collective.

The fourth plenary session of the Central Advisory Commission of the Communist Party of China, elected at the Thirteenth National Congress of the Communist Party of China, was held in Beijing on June 24, 1989. A total of 184 members attended the meeting.

Vice Chairman Song Rongcun presided over the meeting and delivered a speech.

The meeting fully endorsed the report submitted by Comrade Li Peng on behalf of the Political Bureau to the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee, titled "On the Errors Committed by Comrade Zhao Ziyang in the Anti-Party and Anti-Socialist Turmoil." The meeting completely agreed with and supported the resolution of the Fourth Plenum to remove Comrade Zhao Ziyang from his positions as General Secretary of the Central Committee of the Party and other posts, as well as the adjustments made by the Fourth Plenum to the members of the Standing Committee of the Political Bureau and the Secretariat.

The meeting resolutely endorsed Comrade Jiang Zemin assuming the position of General Secretary of the Central Committee. Everyone expressed their determination to fully support the work of the new leadership collective of the Central Committee.

The meeting highly praised the important speech by Comrade Deng Xiaoping and fully agreed with the profound views he put forward regarding the current situation and the tasks of the Party in his speech. Everyone is determined to continue to study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech deeply and use the spirit of the speech to guide their actions.

All members present at the meeting believed that in this anti-Party and anti-socialist turmoil, Comrade Zhao Ziyang committed errors of supporting the turmoil and splitting the Party, and the nature and consequences of these errors are extremely serious. Over a long period, Comrade Zhao Ziyang passively opposed the policy of adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles and opposing bourgeois liberalization, seriously neglected the construction of the Party, spiritual civilization, and ideological and political work, causing serious losses to the Party's cause. The Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee's exposure, criticism, and organizational handling of Comrade Zhao Ziyang's errors are completely necessary and correct.

All members present at the meeting expressed their determination to resolutely respond to the call of the Fourth Plenum of the Thirteenth Central Committee, adhere to the central task of economic construction, adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, and adhere to reform and opening up. They will carry forward the revolutionary spirit of self-reliance and hard work, unite closely with the entire Party and people of all ethnic groups across the country around the Central Committee, and continue the struggle to quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion to the end. They will overcome all difficulties on the road ahead and strive to advance the cause of socialist modernization and reform and opening up.
