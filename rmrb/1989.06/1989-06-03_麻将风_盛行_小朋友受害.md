The prevalence of mahjong fever is increasingly harming the healthy growth of minors, which is a worrying social phenomenon that reporters recently discovered during their visit to Hefei City.

A young couple living on Huizhou Road in Hefei City started inviting people to play mahjong at home about a year ago. Their son, who is in the fourth grade, often watched them play out of curiosity. Soon, the student learned to play mahjong. Sometimes, when the adults were short of one player, they would invite him to join. After a few months, this 11-year-old child became a "little addict," and his grades began to drop. Once, the father returned home from work and found that his son had also invited a few classmates to play mahjong at home.

A survey by the Urban Planning Team of Anhui Province is shocking: among the 407 primary school students surveyed, 37% have learned to play mahjong due to their parents' influence, and 10.5% of the students often participate when their parents play mahjong.

Some parents play mahjong all night, and even gamble in front of their children, seriously disrupting the children's rest, study, and thoughts. A second-grade student from Changjiang Road Second Primary School complained: "My father plays mahjong two or three times a week. They shout and argue when they play, and I can't do my homework. But I dare not say anything, fearing that my father will get angry and beat me."

For this reason, many primary school teachers in Hefei City have called for: to ensure the healthy growth of children, parents should create a good living, learning, and growing environment for them.

### “麻将风”盛行　小朋友受害

    “麻将风”盛行　小朋友受害
    新华社合肥6月2日电（通讯员宋寿、记者宋斌）麻将风日益盛行，少年儿童健康成长受到侵害，这是记者近日在合肥市采访时发现的一个令人忧虑的社会现象。
    家住合肥市徽州路的一对年轻夫妇，去年开始经常邀人在家打麻将。他们正上小学四年级的儿子因好奇经常在旁“观战”。耳濡目染，这位小学生不久也学会了打麻将。有时大人打麻将三缺一，就拉他入伙。几个月下来，这个年仅11岁的孩子竟成了“小瘾君子”，学习成绩不断下降。一次，父亲下班回家，竟发现儿子也邀了几个同学在家打麻将。
    安徽省城调队的一项调查令人吃惊：被调查的407名小学生中，由于受父母影响，已有37％的人学会了打麻将，有10.5％的小学生在家长打麻将时经常参与。
    有些父母打麻将一打就是通宵，甚至当着孩子的面赌博，孩子的休息、学习和思想都受到严重干扰。长江路第二小学一名二年级小学生诉苦说：“我父亲一星期要打两三次麻将，他们一打牌就大吵大嚷，我根本没法做功课，但我又不敢说，怕爸爸生气打我。”
    为此，合肥市许多小学教师呼吁：为了孩子的健康成长，父母应该为他们创造一个良好的生活、学习、成长的家庭环境。
