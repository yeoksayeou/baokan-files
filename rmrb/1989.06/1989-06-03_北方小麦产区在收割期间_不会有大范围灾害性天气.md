As June arrives, the wheat harvesting season is gradually beginning in China's northern wheat-producing regions. The national meteorological department announced today that there will be no large-scale disaster weather in the northern wheat regions in June, and the temperature will be slightly lower than the average.

An expert from the Agricultural Meteorology Research Institute of the National Meteorological Science Research Institute said that since last autumn, the climate in China's northern wheat regions has been warm and the rainfall has been appropriate, with no large-scale disaster weather occurring. The wheat growth this year is significantly better than last year. In late May, during the wheat filling and ripening period, the average temperature in most wheat regions was higher than the same period in previous years, and the rainfall was less than the same period in previous years. Some parts of North China experienced short-term hot and dry winds and short-term strong winds, causing some wheat to lodge. However, the climate in most parts of the north is suitable for wheat filling and ripening, and the wheat growth in the main wheat regions is good. According to preliminary satellite remote sensing predictions for the wheat regions, if there are no major disasters during the harvesting period, it is estimated that the total wheat production this year will be significantly higher than last year.

According to the analysis of the Central Meteorological Observatory on the weather trend in June, the rainfall in the northern wheat regions this month will be slightly less than the same period in previous years, and there will not be large-scale continuous rainy weather. However, some local areas may still experience thunderstorms, strong winds, and hailstorms.

    北方小麦产区在收割期间
    不会有大范围灾害性天气
    据新华社北京6月3日电（记者赵鹏）进入6月，我国北方小麦产区渐次开镰。国家气象部门今天告知：6月份北方麦区不致有大范围灾害性天气，气温接近常年略偏低。
    国家气象科学研究院农业气象研究所专家介绍说，去秋以来，我国北方麦区气候温暖，降水适宜，没有出现大范围灾害天气，小麦长势明显好于去年。5月下旬，正值小麦灌浆成熟期，大部分麦区平均气温较常年同期偏高，降水量较常年同期偏少。华北部分地区出现了短期干热风天气和短时大风，致使部分小麦倒伏。但北方大部地区气候适于小麦灌浆和成熟，主要麦区小麦长势良好。据对麦区卫星遥感初步预测，在收割期间若无重大灾害，预计今年小麦总产量明显高于去年。
    据中央气象台对6月份天气趋势的分析，北方麦区月内降水量较常年同期略为偏少，尚不致有大范围连阴雨天气，但局部地区仍可能出现雷雨、大风、冰雹灾害。
