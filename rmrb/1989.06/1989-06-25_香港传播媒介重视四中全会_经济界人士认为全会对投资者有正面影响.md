Hong Kong's media has quickly reported on the situation of the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

On the evening of June 24, Hong Kong's television stations had already broadcast multiple times via satellite the situation of the "Fourth Plenum" as shown on China Central Television. Until late at night, many households in Hong Kong were still watching the related news on television.

Today, various newspapers in Hong Kong have published news about the "Fourth Plenum" in prominent positions. Several major newspapers have published the full text of the "Fourth Plenum" communiqué, along with brief biographies and photographs of several newly elected members of the Politburo Standing Committee. Seven or eight newspapers have published commentaries.

Today's editorial in our newspaper, "Uphold the Foundation of the State, Walk the Path to a Strong Nation," has been extensively excerpted by two evening newspapers.

Some newspapers have also reported on the reactions of some figures in Hong Kong's economic circles to the "Fourth Plenum." The reports state: "Economic figures believe that with the high-level personnel adjustments in the central government now confirmed, China's political situation is gradually stabilizing and becoming clearer, which has a positive impact on investors' sentiments," "The personnel changes in the Politburo Standing Committee are good news for the economy. Overseas and local investors are more likely to accept this result, which will be beneficial for Hong Kong's economy and stock market."
