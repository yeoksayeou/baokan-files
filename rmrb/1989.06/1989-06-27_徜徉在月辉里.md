	Wandering in the Moonlight
	Yan Chunsheng

	I don’t know when it started, but I have developed a habit: whenever it’s a clear night and I have some free time, I love to walk alone in the fields or open spaces, looking up at the moon.

	I think there aren’t many people who don’t love the moon. There’s a poem that says: “The moon rises in the sky, and all the people on earth look up at it.” Everyone who enjoys the moon has different reasons: poets write about it, refined people admire it, idle people play with it, those who have failed in life sigh over it, and lovers worship it… Even someone as ordinary as me can’t help but look up at the clear moonlight. This is not just a trivial distraction or a pretentious display of emotion; it’s just that the moon’s silvery light is so captivating, making one long for the vast and distant sky.

	Bathing in the moonlight, my thoughts wander between the world and the heavens, the stars and the universe. I have always admired astronomy and geology, believing that these two sciences can broaden one’s horizons and expand one’s mind, allowing human thought to reach out to the universe, explore the earth’s mantle, and transcend history, bringing a sense of joy and detachment.

	Standing in the moonlight, there is a vague sense of exploring the depths of philosophy. The 18th-century German romantic poet Novalis gave a unique definition of philosophy: “Philosophy is the longing to find a home.” People living in cities, surrounded by concrete and steel, breathing polluted air… always have a desire to escape the noise, and sometimes a sense of confusion wells up from the depths of their souls, making them yearn to be in the mountains, fields, or remote wilderness, to embrace nature. But for city dwellers, this is not always possible. Only when you are alone at night, looking up at the moon, with a longing to return to simplicity, perhaps you can find a rare compensation. I think this is a kind of spiritual enjoyment.

	Daydreaming in the moonlight, all the trivial worries and concerns of daily life seem to disappear, and suddenly you feel that the sky and the earth, people and the moon, are all blended together in harmony. All the dirt, imperfections, and obscurities of the world, including one’s own heart which has been tainted by worldly dust, seem to be purified by the silvery moonlight, making you feel that your heart is much more open, and something seems to be brewing within, making you feel very comfortable…

	Is wandering in the moonlight just a matter of leisurely enjoyment?

　　徜徉在月辉里
    严春生
    不知从什么时候起，我有了一个嗜好：只要是晴夜，一有闲暇，总爱踽踽独行于野地里或空旷处，翘首赏月。
    世上不爱月的人可能不多，我想。有诗云：天上一轮才捧出，人间万姓仰头看。芸芸众生所喜观月者，也是心态各异：诗人吟月，雅人赏月，闲人玩月，失意人叹月，痴情人则拜月……即便如一介凡夫的我，也禁不住要在清辉月色之中仰视一番。这，绝不是庸人自扰，亦非故作多情，实在是这如水似银的月华最撩人心弦，最令人神往那深邃邈远的苍穹。
    沐浴在月辉里，思绪就会神游于人间天上、星辰宇宙之间。我一直崇仰天文学和地质学，总以为这两门科学最能开阔人的视野，拓展人的胸怀，从而使人类思维的触角向两端延伸，生发出那种遥望宇宙、瞰察地幔、跨越历史的欣悦与超脱。
    伫望在月辉里，会有一种探索哲学底蕴的朦胧意识。十八世纪德国著名浪漫诗人诺瓦利斯对哲学下了不同凡响的定义：“哲学就是怀着一种乡愁的冲动到处去寻找家园。”都市里的人们居住在钢筋混凝土构筑的街市上，常年呼吸着污染了的空气……总有一种企图摆脱喧嚣的意念，甚至会从心灵深处滋出某种茫然的情绪，恨不能立即置身于山川田园、荒野静僻处，去拥抱大自然。但这对于都市的人来说，并不是随时能够如愿的。只有当你夜阑人静，仰首观月，怀着一种乡愁的“冲动”，去寻觅意绪的返朴归真时，或许不失为难得的补偿。我想，这不能不说是一种精神的享受。
    遐想在月辉里，将平素那些庸碌无聊的宠辱得失排遣殆尽，就会突然觉得天与地、人与月溶融亲和，世间一切污秽、残缺、晦涩，包括自己那颗多少也沾附了世俗尘埃的心，好像已被那水银般的月辉所浸润而得以净化，隐隐地觉得胸襟坦荡了许多，而心眼里又酿就了什么似的，倍感舒畅……
    徜徉在月辉里，难道仅仅是闲情逸致使然么？
