    The MiG-29 Crashed
    By Zhang Qihua, Our Correspondent

    “Look, look, the MiG aircraft has crashed!” Witnesses shouted in various languages. This event shocked reporters and professionals from various countries attending the Paris Air Show. Onlookers craned their necks to see what happened. Visitors from various exhibition halls rushed to the performance area. This tragedy occurred around 4 PM Paris time on June 8.

    Yesterday afternoon, during the opening ceremony of the 38th Paris International Aerospace and Defense Exhibition, it was the turn of the Soviet Union’s MiG-29 to perform. The aircraft was towed out by a small vehicle. Countless eyes were fixed on it, and numerous cameras were aimed at it. This was a sharp-nosed, wide-winged aircraft with two tail fins, the most advanced fighter jet currently owned by the Soviet Union. During the performance, it soared vertically into the sky, then suddenly dove down; it would level off during vertical ascents and descents, and it would perform continuous rolls in the air... The roar of the jet engines was deafening.

    When it was flying low and level, suddenly the nose dipped down and the tail pointed upwards. At an altitude of about 200 to 300 meters, something popped out from the middle of the aircraft, immediately splitting into two parts—one resembling a parachute fluttering away, and the other exploding like a fireball. Meanwhile, the entire aircraft plunged straight down, engulfed in flames and thick smoke. All of this happened in a matter of seconds.

    Amidst the shouts of surprise, the well-trained French firefighters and rescue teams rushed to the scene. The fire was extinguished, and the rescue personnel carried the pilot, who had a bandage on his right eyebrow, to a helicopter. The pilot’s name was Anatoly Kvochur, aged 37. He seemed to have only sustained minor injuries. Lying on the stretcher, he still lifted his head to look around. According to reports, the pilot ejected from the aircraft only 30 meters above the ground, leaving him almost no time to deploy his parachute. The parachute, the pilot, and the aircraft all landed almost simultaneously. People described it as a miraculous escape from death.

### 米格二十九摔下来了

　　米格二十九摔下来了
    本报记者  张启华
    “看，看，米格飞机摔下来了！”目睹这一惨景的人们用各种语言惊呼着。这一事件震惊了参观布尔日国际航空展的各国记者和专业人员。在现场的人翘首争看究竟。各展厅参观的人也纷纷向表演场跑去。这一幕惨剧发生在巴黎时间６月８日下午４时许。
    昨天下午，在第３８届布尔日国际航空航天博览会开幕式上，各国参展的飞机表演轮到苏联米格２９，它被小车拖出展地。无数双眼睛盯着，众多的摄像机、照相机瞄着。这是一架机头尖尖的、翼展较大、有两片尾翼的飞机，是目前苏联拥有的最先进的战斗机。表演中，它在蓝天中时而垂直爬高直插蓝天，时而又急速掉转机头垂直下冲；一会儿在垂直升降过程中拉起平飞，一会儿又在空中连续翻转……喷气的呼啸震耳欲聋。
    当它滑下低空平飞时，突然间机头冲下，尾部朝天。在离地大约二、三百米高度，从机身中间弹出一个东西，立即分成两个部分，一似伞状东西飘飞，一个似火球的东西爆开；与此同时，整个飞机直插地面，一团火光，浓烟滚滚。这一切，都发生在分秒之间。
    在一片惊呼声中，训练有素的法国消防队、救护队奔向现场。大火熄灭了，救护人员抬着右眉上方敷着纱布的飞行员往直升机上送。飞行员名叫阿纳托利·沃特库尔，今年３７岁。看来，他只受了点轻伤。他躺在担架上还把头抬起来，瞪大眼睛朝外看。据报道，飞行员从机上弹出时离地面只有３０米，他几乎没有时间去打开降落伞，伞、人、机几乎同时落地，人们称他是死里逃生。
