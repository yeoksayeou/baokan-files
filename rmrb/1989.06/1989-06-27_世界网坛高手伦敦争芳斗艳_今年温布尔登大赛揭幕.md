The Wimbledon tennis championships began today in London. Reigning champion Stefan Edberg easily won his first match in straight sets, while world number one Ivan Lendl had to battle through four sets to advance to the second round.

Edberg, the world's second-ranked player from Sweden, confidently defeated Canadian player Glenn Michibata with a score of 6-3, 6-4, and 6-1. Last year, Edberg won the men's singles title at Wimbledon by defeating Boris Becker of West Germany in the final. Lendl, from Czechoslovakia, faced a strong challenge from 18-year-old Venezuelan youngster Luis Herrera. After more than three hours of intense play, Lendl managed to win with a score of 7-6, 4-6, 6-3, and 6-1. Herrera, the world junior men's singles champion, had previously defeated Edberg in a grass-court tournament just 11 days ago. Lendl praised Herrera, saying, "His serve is quite good, and his returns are also very powerful."

In other men's singles matches, the third-seeded Becker and the fourth-seeded Swede Mats Wilander both won their first-round matches 3-0, advancing smoothly to the next round.

The majority of the women's singles first-round matches will begin tomorrow. Steffi Graf of West Germany, Martina Navratilova of the United States, and Gabriela Sabatini of Argentina are seeded first, second, and third, respectively.

    新华社伦敦６月２６日电  温布尔登网球锦标赛今天在这里开始，卫冕冠军埃德贝里直落３盘通过第一关，而世界头号种子伦德尔则经４盘苦战进入第二轮。
    世界２号种子、瑞典的埃德贝里今天信心十足地以６∶３、６∶４和６∶１击败加拿大选手普里德姆。在去年的温布尔登网赛决赛中，他战胜西德的贝克尔后摘得男子单打桂冠。捷克斯洛伐克的伦德尔今天遇到１８岁的委内瑞拉小将佩雷拉的有力挑战，经过３个多小时的角逐，才以７∶６、４∶６、６∶３和６∶１获胜。佩雷拉是世界青少年男子单打冠军，１１天以前，曾在这里的草地网球赛上战胜过埃德贝里。伦德尔评价他“发球相当出色，回球也很有力”。
    在男单另外两场比赛中，第三号种子贝克尔和第四号种子、瑞典的维兰德都以３∶０击败对手，顺利通过第一轮。
    女子单打第一轮绝大多数场次从明天开始。西德的格拉夫、美国的纳夫拉蒂洛娃和阿根廷的萨瓦蒂尼分列第一、二、三号种子。
