According to information provided by the Central Committee's Work Committee for Directly Affiliated Organizations, various directly affiliated organizations of the Central Committee have held meetings for Party members and cadres over the past few days to thoroughly study and discuss the spirit of the Fourth Plenum. Leaders of various departments and agencies of the Central Committee, along with a broad range of Party members and cadres, have unanimously expressed their firm support for all the decisions made by the Plenum, for Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech, for Comrade Li Peng's report, for the decision to appoint Comrade Jiang Zemin as the General Secretary of the Central Committee and to adjust some members of the Central Leadership, and for the decision to handle the serious errors committed by Comrade Zhao Ziyang. They have also pledged to unite more closely around the Party Central Committee, to thoroughly quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion, to strengthen the Party's leadership, to fully complete the four tasks proposed by the Plenum, and to achieve victory in socialist construction and reform and opening-up, making new contributions.

The General Office of the Central Committee held a meeting to study the spirit of the Plenum and, in light of the actual situation of the General Office, put forward five opinions on further implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenum. They emphasized the need to thoroughly study the Plenum documents, to fully understand the nature and serious consequences of the errors committed by Comrade Zhao Ziyang in the anti-Party and anti-socialist turmoil, and to consciously unite around the new leadership core of the Central Committee, giving full effort to all work.

The Central Organization Department held departmental meetings and meetings for Party members and cadres to disseminate, study, and discuss the spirit of the Plenum. Everyone agreed that this Plenum is a very important meeting in the history of the Party's development, which will have a profound impact on ensuring the continuity of the Party's line, principles, and policies, and on further improving reform, opening-up, and construction. They are determined, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee and guided by the spirit of the Fourth Plenum, to work together with all Party members to do a good job in Party building and cadre work.

After studying the spirit of the Plenum, the Central Propaganda Department's leadership promptly put forward opinions on implementing the spirit of the 13th Fourth Plenum and doing a good job in propaganda work. They pointed out that Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech on June 9 to military leaders above the rank of major in Beijing is a guiding document for the entire Party's work, as well as for propaganda and ideological work. It is the basis and guiding principle for doing a good job in propaganda and ideological work. The comrades in the department expressed their determination to use the spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech to guide their thoughts and actions, and to do a good job in the Party's propaganda work in the future.

The leaders of the International Liaison Department unanimously expressed that at present, they should earnestly disseminate and deeply study the spirit of the Plenum, strengthen political and ideological work, strengthen the construction of the Party's foreign affairs team, and use the spirit of the Plenum to unify the thoughts and actions of Party members and staff. At the same time, they should use various channels and methods to actively report and publicize the spirit of the Plenum to foreign political parties and organizations, and further strengthen the Party's foreign affairs work in the new situation.

The Central Discipline Inspection Commission held an expanded meeting of the Standing Committee on the morning of June 26 to deploy and put forward requirements on how the commission should disseminate and study the spirit of the Fourth Plenum and the Fourth Session of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission. The Standing Committee decided to concentrate on a period of time for study and discussion, to thoroughly understand the spirit of the documents, to closely link with the actual situation of discipline inspection work and ideological work, and to study measures to implement the spirit of the Fourth Plenum.

The expanded meeting of the Central United Front Work Department believed that the convening of the Fourth Plenum marks the decisive victory in quelling the counter-revolutionary rebellion and the birth of a new leadership collective of the Party. Everyone expressed that as a working organ of the Party Central Committee, they must earnestly grasp the construction of the Party, follow the deployment of the Central Committee, and act in accordance with the instructions of the Central Committee. They must maintain political and ideological unity with the Central Committee.

The leaders and Party members and cadres of the Central Documents Research Office, Party History Research Office, Rural Policy Research Office, and Central Compilation and Translation Bureau held meetings to thoroughly study and discuss the spirit of the Plenum. Everyone expressed full confidence in the new Party Central Committee and in the future of socialism, and pledged to link the spirit of the Plenum with the actual situation of their units, to study thoroughly, to raise their awareness, to guard their posts, and to work hard, to make actual efforts under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, and to firmly complete the four major tasks proposed by the Plenum.

The Central Committee's Work Committee for Directly Affiliated Organizations has earnestly disseminated, studied, and discussed the spirit of the Plenum and issued a notice to various organizational committees. They required that the Party organizations at all levels of the Central Committee's directly affiliated organizations earnestly organize all Party members and cadres to study the spirit of the Fourth Plenum, to unify their thoughts, to continuously raise their awareness of continuing to implement the line, principles, and policies since the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, to continue to adhere to "one center, two basic points." They must unite more closely around the Party Central Committee, work together, strive hard, overcome all difficulties on the road ahead, and achieve new victories. In the study, they must closely link with the actual situation, strengthen the construction of the Party within the organization, strengthen ideological and political work, and in further stabilizing the situation, rectifying and consolidating, and deepening reform, strive to play the role that Party organizations and Communist Party members should play.

Various departments of the Central State Organs have earnestly studied and discussed the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee and are determined to grasp the four major tasks at hand.

After the successful conclusion of the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee, various departments of the Central State Organs immediately took action, quickly disseminating, studying, and implementing the spirit. By today, the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, the Supreme People's Court, the Supreme People's Procuratorate, the General Office of the State Council, and 40 ministries and commissions have held meetings for Party member leaders and cadres; 46 directly affiliated institutions, offices, and public institutions of the State Council have held meetings for leaders and cadres at the bureau, office, room, and bureau levels; 27 national-level companies, banks, associations, and federations have held meetings for general managers, bank presidents, and chairpersons to earnestly study and discuss the documents of the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee.

Various departments unanimously agreed in their studies that the Fourth Plenum was held well and timely, with important practical and historical significance, fully in line with the wishes of the Party and the people. They expressed their complete support for all the decisions made by the Fourth Plenum, for Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech, for the report by Comrade Li Peng on behalf of the Political Bureau to the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee on the errors committed by Comrade Zhao Ziyang in the anti-Party and anti-socialist turmoil, for the resolution to remove Comrade Zhao Ziyang from his positions as General Secretary of the Central Committee and other positions, and for the adjustments made by the Fourth Plenum to the members of the Political Bureau Standing Committee and the Secretariat. Various departments expressed that the foundation of the state must never be forgotten, and the path to a strong country must never be abandoned. Under the leadership of the new leadership team of the Party Central Committee, the Central State Organs must revive the revolutionary spirit, carry forward the tradition of hard work and self-reliance, strive to set an example in implementing the spirit of the Fourth Plenum of the 13th Central Committee, firmly grasp the four major tasks proposed in the communiqué, redouble their efforts, fulfill their duties, and do a good job in their respective departments' work.

Various departments generally believed in their discussions that the Fourth Plenum was held at a crucial moment when the counter-revolutionary rebellion had been significantly suppressed. It has important practical and historical significance for further stabilizing the national situation, for continuing to unswervingly implement the line and principles and policies of the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee, and for continuing to implement the basic line proposed by the 13th Party Congress of "one center, two basic points."

Various departments generally believed that in the past two months of serious political struggle, the series of major decisions and measures taken by the Party Central Committee were necessary and correct. The older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, with Comrade Deng Xiaoping at the core, played a major role when the Party and the state were in a critical situation. The People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and the public security police made important contributions to quelling the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Everyone expressed their determination to earnestly study the spirit of the Fourth Plenum, to study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech, to unify their thoughts with the decisions of the Fourth Plenum, and to unify their thoughts with the spirit of Comrade Deng Xiaoping's speech.

In the study and discussion, various departments, in light of the severe facts of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital, talked about how Comrade Zhao Ziyang committed errors in supporting the turmoil and splitting the Party at a critical moment concerning the life and death of the Party and the state, and how the nature and consequences of his errors were extremely serious. For a long time, he neglected Party building, did not focus on ideological and political work and the construction of socialist spiritual civilization, took a negative attitude towards adhering to the four cardinal principles, supported and indulged in bourgeois liberalization, causing serious losses to the Party's cause. Various departments unanimously expressed their support for the Plenum's decision to remove his position as General Secretary and other positions and to continue to investigate his problems.

Various departments believed that the Fourth Plenum adjusted the Party Central Committee's leadership structure, elected Comrade Jiang Zemin as the General Secretary of the Party, which is a correct decision to strengthen the Party's core leadership and ensure the continuity and stability of the Party's line, principles, and policies. The facts once again prove that our Party has the ability to solve its own problems and gradually form a more united and stronger leadership core in the struggle. Various departments firmly believe that with such a strong core, our Party has great hope, our country has great hope, and we will definitely achieve greater victories in the cause of reform, opening-up, and construction.

Various departments, in light of the actual work and characteristics of their respective departments, expressed their determination to firmly grasp the four major tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenum. Everyone believed that these four tasks are in line with the wishes of the Party, the military, and the people, embodying the Party Central Committee's far-sighted strategic vision and high sense of responsibility for the state and the nation. Everyone firmly believed that as long as we can firmly implement Comrade Deng Xiaoping's instructions, we will definitely be able to win the trust of the people and enhance the confidence of the entire Party and the people. Party members and cadres expressed their determination to firmly respond to the call of the Fourth Plenum, to unswervingly take economic construction as the center, to correctly adhere to the four cardinal principles, to adhere to reform and opening-up, to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of hard work and self-reliance, to closely unite around the Party Central Committee, to firmly carry out the struggle to quell the counter-revolutionary rebellion to the end, to continue to implement the principles and tasks determined by the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress, to do a good job in their respective departments' work, and to achieve greater victories in reform and construction.

Recently, the Central Committee's Work Committee for State Organs held an expanded meeting to earnestly study and discuss the spirit of the Fourth Plenum and Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech, and to research measures to study and implement the spirit in Party organizations at all levels of the Central State Organs. They decided to organize the study of Party members and cadres in the Central State Organs, to concentrate on time for training in rotation, to firmly follow the requirements of the Party Central Committee, to strengthen the Party's work and ideological and political work in the Central State Organs, to take practical and effective measures, to eliminate corruption, to maintain integrity, to grasp Party discipline construction, and to make the Central State Organs truly play a leading role nationwide.
