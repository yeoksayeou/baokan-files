Indonesian Foreign Minister Says
Normalization of Relations with China Not Affected

WELLINGTON, June 22 (Xinhua) — Indonesian Foreign Minister Ali Alatas, who is visiting New Zealand, said today here that the recent events in China will not affect the process of normalizing relations between Indonesia and China.

Alatas made the remarks at a press conference here.

He said, "The normalization of relations between China and Indonesia has its own considerations and momentum of development." "The current situation in China is China's internal affair. China has its own considerations and environment. We hope these two matters do not affect each other."

China recently suppressed a counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing. When asked about his views on the recent events in China, Alatas said, "We have neither the tradition nor the desire to comment on the internal affairs of other countries."

Alatas arrived in New Zealand on June 21 for a three-day visit.

　　印尼外长说    
    同中国关系正常化不受影响
    新华社惠灵顿６月２２日电  正在新西兰访问的印度尼西亚外交部长阿里·阿拉塔斯今天在此间说，中国最近发生的事情不会影响印度尼西亚同中国关系正常化进程。
    阿拉塔斯是在此间记者招待会上说这番话的。
    他说：“中国和印尼关系正常化的进程有它自己的考虑和发展势头”，“中国目前发生的事情，是中国的内政。中国有自己的考虑和自己的环境。我们希望这两件事互不影响。”
    中国最近在北京平息了反革命暴乱。当有记者问及他对中国最近发生的事件的看法时，阿拉塔斯说：“我们既没有评论别国内政的传统，也没有这方面的愿望。”
    阿拉塔斯是２１日到达新西兰进行为期三天的访问的。
