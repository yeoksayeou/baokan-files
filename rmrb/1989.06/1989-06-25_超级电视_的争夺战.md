	The Battle for "Super TV"
	Wáng Rújūn

	Television, the "youngster" of the electronics industry, has won the world's favor with its unique charm, becoming an important tool for people's work, life, and entertainment. Since the United States began television broadcasting in 1941, television has continuously innovated, from black and white to color, from small to medium to large, from desktop to wall-mounted to pocket-sized, from "convex arc" to "flat angle," and so on. Now, a new type of television—high-definition television—is attracting the attention of the international community. It is called "super TV."

	The United States, Japan, and Western European countries are racing to develop it.

		An Unprecedented Revolution

	High-definition television represents a revolutionary breakthrough in many aspects. In terms of ordinary television, the scanning lines for the NTSC system used in the United States and Japan are 525 lines, while the SECAM system used in France and the Soviet Union has 625 lines. In contrast, high-definition television has increased the number of scanning lines to 1050, 1125, and 1250, significantly improving image resolution.

	High-definition television can accommodate five times the amount of information as current color TVs. Additionally, while the broadcasting system for current televisions uses FM modulation, high-definition television uses a new PCM encoding method, virtually eliminating audio distortion, thus forming a comprehensive audio-visual system composed of high-definition images and high-fidelity sound.

	People believe that high-definition television will bring an unprecedented revolution to the entire electronics industry.

	Firstly, in terms of applications, high-definition television is not limited to television broadcasting but can be applied to all aspects of the information dissemination field. It will enter areas such as information retrieval, art resources, electronic dictionaries, medical education, printing and publishing, commercial sales, industrial production, and even military radar systems.

	Secondly, since high-definition television transmits information using digital signals instead of the analog signals used by ordinary televisions, it will bring a highly impactful "digital revolution" to the entire electronics industry. Telephones, semiconductors, tape recorders, VCRs, movies, and even the computer industry will be greatly affected.

	Moreover, the digital signals of high-definition television will integrate fax machines, copiers, and computer output devices, thus posing a challenge to computer peripherals.

		Intense Competition

	Currently, high-definition television has not yet entered the practical stage, but a global competition is already underway around it.

	Japan has been developing high-definition television for nearly 20 years and is currently in the lead. During the Seoul Olympics last year, they conducted a trial broadcast that caused a sensation. Japan plans to begin limited satellite broadcasting of high-definition television this year and to launch a complete satellite transmission system by 1990.

	Although Western European countries lag behind Japan in this area, they have been catching up in recent years. An important part of the European Eureka plan is to develop a high-definition television system. Last year, at the International Broadcasting Conference held in the United States, the first batch of Western European products was demonstrated. The high-definition television developed by Western Europe has compatibility functions and can match the existing ordinary television transmission system. It is expected that by the mid-1990s, Western Europe will officially begin high-definition television broadcasting.

	The United States is naturally not willing to fall behind. In January of this year, 17 major companies, including the International Business Machines Corporation and Apple, agreed to cooperate in developing high-definition television. In mid-March, the U.S. Congress held a hearing and preliminarily drafted a five-year plan for developing high-definition television, with the government providing $100 million in research funds annually. According to reports, high-definition televisions developed in the United States are expected to be launched in the market in 1992 or 1993.

	Currently, both Japan and Western Europe are demanding that the United States support the internationalization of their own standards. Whichever country's standard is internationalized will bring enormous commercial benefits. It is predicted that by 2010, the global sales of high-definition television will reach $40 billion, with the United States alone accounting for $11 billion. The competition to develop high-definition television will become increasingly fierce.

	The internationalization of standards is the key to whether high-definition television can be popularized worldwide. Another challenge is the price issue. Experts estimate that when high-definition television first appears, each unit may cost $3,000 or more. Therefore, when high-definition television will enter ordinary households is still a question.

　　“超级电视”的争夺战
    王如君
    电视，这个电子工业界的“晚辈”，以其独具的魅力赢得了世人的宠爱，成了人们工作、生活和娱乐的重要工具。自１９４１年美国开始运用电视广播以来，电视不断创新，从黑白到彩色，从小型、中型到大型，从台式、挂式到袖珍式，从“凸面弧角式”到“平面直角式”等等。现在，又有一种新型电视——高清晰度电视正引起国际社会的关注，它被称为“超级电视”。
    美国、日本和西欧国家正在竞相研制。
    　　　　空前革命
    高清晰度电视在许多方面具有变革性的突破。就普通电视而言，美国、日本使用的ＮＴＳＣ制式电视的扫描线为５２５条，法国和苏联等国用的ＳＥＣＡＭ制式为６２５条，而高清晰度电视的扫描线却增多到１０５０条、１１２５条和１２５０条，大大提高了图像分辨率。
    高清晰度电视容纳的信息量为现行彩电的５倍。另外，现行电视的广播系统是采用ＦＭ调频式，而高清晰度电视则采用新的ＰＣＭ编码式，几乎没有音响失真，从而形成由高清晰度图像和高保真音响组成的视听综合系统。
    人们认为，高清晰度电视为整个电子工业带来了空前革命。
    首先，从用途方面来看，高清晰度电视不单单限于电视广播，还可应用于传播领域的所有方面，并将进入情报检索、美术资料、电子辞典、医学教育、印刷出版、商业销售和工业生产，乃至军用雷达系统。
    其次，由于它传送信息的方式由普通电视的波纹信号，改用数字式信号，所以对整个电子工业会带来一场冲击性极强的“数字革命”。电话、半导体、录音机、录像机、电影，甚至电脑行业都会受到极大影响。
    同时，高清晰度电视的数字式信号还使传真机、复印机和电脑读出机一体化，从而对电脑的配套产品带来挑战。
    　　　　激烈争夺
    目前，高清晰度电视还未进入实用阶段，围绕它正在掀起一场世界性的竞争。
    日本开发高清晰度电视已有近２０年的历史，现在居于领先地位，去年汉城奥运会期间，曾搞过试播，引起过轰动。日本计划今年开始有限的高清晰度电视卫星传播，到１９９０年推出完整的卫星传输系统。
    西欧国家在这方面虽然落后于日本，但近年来奋起直追。欧洲尤里卡计划的一项重要内容就是研制高清晰度电视系统。去年，在美国举行的国际广播会议上，西欧的首批成品曾作过演示。西欧研制的高清晰度电视具有兼容功能，能与现有的普通电视发射系统相匹配。预计到９０年代中期，西欧将正式开始高清晰度电视的播放业务。
    美国自然也不甘落后。今年１月，美国国际商用机器公司、苹果公司等１７家大企业同意合作研制高清晰度电视。３月中旬，美国国会举行听证会，并初步拟定了为期５年的高清晰度电视研制计划，政府每年提供１亿美元的研制经费。据报道，美国研制的高清晰度电视机可望在１９９２年或１９９３年投放市场。
    目前，日本和西欧都要求美国支持使其自己的制式标准国际化。无论哪国的标准国际化，都会带来巨大的商业利益。据预测，到２０１０年，高清晰度电视世界销售额将高达４００亿美元，单美国一国的销售额就将达１１０亿美元。研制高清晰度电视的争夺将日趋激烈。
    制式的标准国际化，是高清晰度电视能否普及于世界的关键。另一难题是价格问题。有专家估计，高清晰度电视问世之初，每台售价可能高达３０００美元或更多。所以高清晰度电视何时进入寻常百姓家，还是个疑问。
