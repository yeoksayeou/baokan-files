Under the wise and decisive leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, the severe counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital has been suppressed, achieving a decisive victory in this struggle. In this struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, the People's Liberation Army and the People's Armed Police, entrusted by the Party and the people, have demonstrated an unyielding spirit of fearlessness in the face of hardships and sacrifices. They have defended the capital, defended the People's Republic, and defended the achievements of a decade of reform. Practice has once again proven that our army is forever the defender of the state, the defender of the socialist system, and the defender of the people's interests. They are the most beloved people. Practice has also once again proven that strengthening military-civilian unity is an important guarantee for overcoming all enemies, surmounting all difficulties, and ensuring the victory of the revolution and construction. To achieve a complete victory in this struggle, it is particularly important to do a good job in support-military and preferential treatment for families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled veterans, and to strengthen military-civilian relations at this time. Therefore, the following notice is issued:

1. Extensively carry out propaganda and education work. Seriously study and propagate the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country," and the important speech by Deng Xiaoping, Chairman of the Central Military Commission. Propagate the great achievements of the People's Liberation Army in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion and stabilizing the national situation. Recognize that strengthening military-political and military-civilian unity is an important guarantee for defending the four cardinal principles and continuing to push forward the construction and reform. At the same time, strengthen ideological and political work among the broad masses of preferential treatment objects, encouraging them to firmly align with the Party Central Committee, seriously implement the spirit of the instructions from the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission on suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion and stabilizing the situation. They should stay at their posts, work hard in production and work, and resolutely fight against the handful of people who created the counter-revolutionary rebellion. They should make new contributions to maintaining stability and unity.

2. Extensively carry out patriotic support-military activities. The people's army's suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion is a just action to safeguard the fundamental interests of the people. The broad masses of the people should fully understand and trust this, and consciously safeguard the lofty reputation of the people's army. They should mobilize and organize people from all walks of life to enthusiastically support the martial law troops and the People's Armed Police in carrying out their missions, actively solve their practical difficulties, create conditions, and provide conveniences. At the same time, they should care for the thoughts and lives of the families of the troops and the People's Armed Police carrying out martial law missions, and eliminate their worries. Those who have made outstanding achievements in patriotic support-military activities should be commended.

3. Timely do a good job in consolation work. For the wounded soldiers in the task of suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion and stopping the turmoil, organize consolation activities to make them rest assured and recover their health as soon as possible. For the families of the martyrs who sacrificed their lives, local leaders should personally visit each household to do a good job in consolation, promptly issue funeral allowances, and help them solve difficulties in life and production. Encourage them to turn their grief into strength, take care of their health, and make more contributions to the four modernizations.

4. All levels of civil affairs departments should place the work of support-military and preferential treatment for families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled veterans in an important position in their current work, strengthen leadership, make arrangements, and promptly report the situation to the Party committee and the government. They should serve as good advisors and ensure that the work of support-military and preferential treatment for families of revolutionary martyrs and disabled veterans is well done. With practical actions, they should contribute to achieving a complete victory in this struggle.
