Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, June 24th.

Argentina's President-elect Menem said on June 24th that the economic policy goals of the next government are to reduce inflation, improve the people's standard of living, and develop the country's economic capabilities.

Menem said in an interview with a radio station that the economic adjustment being studied is very strict. He pointed out that it is time to make sacrifices to help the country get out of the crisis. He suggested that those who have cars, when they can no longer afford gasoline after the price adjustment, should buy a bicycle to ride.

Menem won the election on May 14th. According to the Argentine Constitution, Menem should have taken office on December 10th. However, due to the country's serious economic crisis, after negotiations, Menem will take office early on July 8th.

　　阿根廷下届政府经济目标   
    降低通货膨胀
    新华社布宜诺斯艾利斯６月２４日电  阿根廷当选总统梅内姆２４日说，下届政府的经济政策目标是降低通货膨胀、提高人民消费水平和发展国家的经济能力。
    梅内姆在接受一家电台采访时说，正在研究中的经济调整是非常严厉的。他指出，现在是做出牺牲以使国家摆脱危机的时刻了。他建议那些有汽车的人，在汽油调价后付不起油钱的时候，应该买辆自行车骑。
    梅内姆在５月１４日的大选中获胜。按阿根廷宪法，梅内姆本应在１２月１０日就职。但因国家面临严重经济危机，经过协商，梅内姆将提前于７月８日就职。
