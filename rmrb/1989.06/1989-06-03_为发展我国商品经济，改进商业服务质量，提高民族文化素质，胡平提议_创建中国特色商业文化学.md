Commercial Minister Hu Ping's proposal to establish "commercial cultural studies" has attracted the attention of people both inside and outside China. The momentum to study "commercial cultural studies" has already begun in China. Recently, the author specially visited Hu Ping to discuss the issue of "commercial cultural studies." Below is the transcript of the interview.

Q: The enterprise culture construction that emerged in the late 1970s has had a significant impact in economically developed countries abroad. However, "commercial cultural studies" is being proposed for the first time. What considerations led you to propose establishing commercial cultural studies?

A: "Commerce is commerce, and culture is culture; they don't communicate with each other." This is an old notion deeply rooted in people's minds. In reality, commerce and culture are not unrelated. The more developed the commodity economy, the richer the commercial culture. Establishing commercial cultural studies in China is not only necessary for the development of the commodity economy but also for strengthening ideological and political work, improving the level of commercial work, and enhancing the cultural attainment of the entire nation. For example, commercial sales require advertising, and good advertising must study the cultural and psychological qualities of the nation. Only when the product quality is suitable for the market and the psychological penetration is just right can business thrive. The study of commercial culture can become an important intangible asset.

Q: Commercial culture is born and nurtured with the emergence of modern commodity economy and urban culture. What scope does the commercial culture you propose include?

A: The scope of commercial culture covers all industries in the circulation sector. Tea has "tea culture," China has the "Classic of Tea," and Japan has the "Way of Tea"; alcohol has alcohol culture, Li Bai's "a hundred poems from a jug of wine," and many famous lines in Tang poetry are about drinking; during the Qing Dynasty, snuff was popular, forming snuff art, which combines tobacco with culture; gourmets are a product of China's high-level food culture; elegant fashion shows are fashion culture; service also has culture (such as photography). The idiom "buying a box and returning the pearl" praises packaging. Good packaging can stimulate consumers' desire to buy. There are also advertising culture, window display culture, counter culture... Traditional temple fairs are also a form of culture and commodities combined. Commercial cultural studies have rich content and need to be well studied.

Q: The formation of China's modern commodity economy and commercial culture can be said to have been a difficult process. Apart from external reasons, there are also deep-rooted reasons in our nation's traditional culture of seclusion and conservatism. How can we break free from the shackles of traditional culture's backwardness while also absorbing the essence of national aesthetic consciousness, making the newly created commercial culture more Chinese in character?

A: Traditional culture is China's national condition, and modern culture is the need to go to the world. Commercial culture should adopt the principle of absorbing the essence and discarding the dross, organically combining traditional culture, modern culture, and overseas culture. Japan's Doraemon and America's Mickey Mouse have a great influence in various countries because they constantly change and have rich imagination and conception. The role of our "Sun Wukong" should be much greater, but due to the lack of change and not properly combining with modern culture, the "Monkey King's" magic is greatly affected. Our food carvings for entertaining foreign guests, if we can combine traditional forms like fortune, prosperity, longevity, and joy, the influence would be much greater. In short, the creation of "commercial cultural studies" cannot lose China's characteristics; otherwise, it would be like Dong Shi's imitation of Xi Shi.

Q: Commerce, as a component of the economy, is the foundation for the development of social culture, and culture in turn serves the economy, including commerce. Regarding China's current commercial culture, what is your assessment of the situation?

A: There are 30 million commercial workers actively engaged in the frontline of economic life, and their service quality plays an important role in stabilizing national life, thus reflecting the level of commercial culture. Good commercial culture has a motivating effect, helps to create a competitive atmosphere that drives people forward, and can change the face of commercial work. In this regard, the commercial front has conducted some beneficial explorations in recent years. For example, many research institutions and commercial enterprises have conducted studies on customer psychology, consumer psychology, and market forecasting. Some stores have also compiled and promoted civilized language for receiving guests, promoting the scientific management of service work and improving service quality. In addition, there have been significant improvements in the use of commodity advertising and packaging. The cultural attainment of commercial workers is gradually improving, with the average educational level reaching junior high school, which is obviously beneficial for the prosperity of commercial culture and the development of the commodity economy.

    为发展我国商品经济，改进商业服务质量，提高民族文化素质，胡平提议
    创建中国特色商业文化学
    王静
    商业部长胡平提出创建“商业文化学”的倡议，引起海内外各界人士的关注。研究“商业文化学”的势头已在国内发端。日前，笔者专门就“商业文化学”问题走访了胡平同志。下面是答问录。
    问：70年代末兴起的企业文化建设在海外经济发达国家已颇具影响，而“商业文化学”尚属首次提出，您讲要建立商业文化学是出于怎样的考虑？
    答：“商业是商业，文化是文化，彼此不说话。”这是人们头脑中根深蒂固的老观念。其实，商业与文化并非不搭界。商品经济越发达，商业文化也越丰富。在我国建立商业文化学，不仅是发展商品经济的需要，也是加强思想政治工作、提高商业工作水平和提高全民族文化素质的需要。例如，商业销售要做广告，而广告做得好，就必须研究民族文化心理素质。只有商品品质适销对路，心理渗透恰到好处，生意才能越做越红火。商业文化的研究可以成为一种重要的无形资财。
    问：商业文化是伴随现代商品经济的出现和城市文化的形成而孕育诞生的。您提出的商业文化包含哪些范围？
    答：商业文化的范围遍及流通领域的各个行业。茶有“茶文化”，中国有《茶经》，日本有《茶道》；酒有酒文化，李白“斗酒诗百篇”，唐诗中有不少名句是饮酒之作；满清时代吸鼻烟，形成鼻烟工艺，把烟与文化连在一起了；美食家则是中国高水平饮食文化的产物；高雅的时装表演，就是时装文化；服务也有文化（如摄影）。有句成语“买椟还珠”中就有赞美包装的意思。好的包装可以刺激消费者的购买欲，其它还有广告文化、橱窗文化、柜台文化……传统的庙会也是一种文化和商品结合的形式。商业文化学内容丰富，需要很好研究。
    问：中国近代商品经济和商业文化的形成可以说是步履艰难，除了外部原因外，还有我们民族传统文化的封闭与保守的深刻根源。您认为怎样才能既挣脱传统文化落后面的羁绊，又吸取民族审美意识中的精华，使新创的商业文化更具有中国特色？
    答：传统文化是中国的国情，现代文化是走向世界的需要。商业文化应采取吸取精华，剔除其糟粕的原则，将传统文化、现代文化以及海外文化有机地结合起来。日本的阿童木、美国的米老鼠在各国有很大的影响，就是因为它们不断变化，有丰富的想象力和构思。我们“孙悟空”的作用应该比它们大得多，但由于缺少变，没有很好地和现代化文化结合起来，使“猴王”的神通大受影响。我们宴请外宾的食物雕刻，如能把福禄寿喜等传统形式结合进来，影响就大多了。总之，创建“商业文化学”不能丢了中国的特色，否则，就成了东施效颦。
    问：商业作为经济的一个组成部分，是社会文化赖以发展的基础，文化反过来为经济包括为商业服务。就我国目前的商业文化，您认为现状如何？
    答：全国有3000万商业职工活跃在经济生活的第一线，他们的服务质量对稳定国民生活起着重要作用，因而集中地反映了商业文化的水准。由于好的商业文化具有激励作用，有助于产生一种催人奋进的竞争气氛，可以使商业工作面貌改观。在这方面，近年来商业战线进行了一些有益的探索，比如许多研究机构和商业企业开展了顾客心理学、消费心理学和市场预测学的研究，一些商店还编制推广了文明待客语言，促使服务工作科学化，服务质量上台阶。此外，在利用商品广告和包装方面也有较明显的进步。商业队伍内部职工的文化修养在逐年提高，平均文化程度已达到初中水平，这显然是有益于商业文化的繁荣和商品经济发展的。
