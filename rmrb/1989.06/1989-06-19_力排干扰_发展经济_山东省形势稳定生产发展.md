Overcoming Interference to Develop the Economy: Shandong's Situation Stable, Production Developing

Xinhua News Agency and People's Daily reporters Jia Jianzhou and Mao Zhicun report from Jinan: At a recent economic work meeting, Ma Jianchun, Secretary of the Shandong Provincial Party Committee, said that during the period of turmoil, Shandong Province overcame interference, not only reducing economic losses but also achieving new developments in various productions.

In mid-May, disturbances occurred in cities such as Jinan and Qingdao. Faced with this situation, the Party committees and governments at various levels in Shandong Province took two approaches: one to stop the turmoil and stabilize the situation; the other to develop the economy and ensure supply. They organized Party members to study the relevant spirits of the Central Committee's decision to stop the turmoil, unify thoughts, and lead the broad masses of workers and peasants to uphold the spirit of being the masters of the state, actively resist the turmoil, and firmly guard their production posts. More than 240,000 large, medium, and small enterprises across the province generally maintained normal production, with an attendance rate of more than 95% among the 6 million workers. On June 5 and 6, under the influence of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing, a small number of people in Jinan and Qingdao set up roadblocks, causing city traffic to be temporarily interrupted. In extremely difficult conditions, the workers in these two cities used every possible means to go to work, taking detours through alleys when main roads were blocked, and walking or riding bicycles when there were no buses, ensuring that the various links of production continued to operate normally.

　　力排干扰　发展经济
    山东省形势稳定生产发展
    本报济南６月１９日电  本报记者贾建舟、新华社记者毛致存报道：中共山东省委书记姜春云在日前召开的经济工作座谈会上说，在发生动乱期间，山东省力排干扰，不仅减少了经济损失，而且使各项生产有了新的发展。
    ５月中旬，济南、青岛等地发生了动乱现象。面对这种情况，山东省各级党组织和政府一手抓制止动乱，稳定形势；一手抓发展经济，保障供给。他们组织党员学习中央制止动乱的有关精神，统一思想，带领广大工人和农民发扬爱国家的主人翁精神，自觉抵制动乱，坚守生产岗位。全省２．４万多个大中小型企业，普遍坚持正常生产，６００万名工人出勤率一直保持在９５％以上。６月５日和６月６日，在北京出现反革命暴乱的影响下，济南、青岛极少数人设置路障，使城市交通一度中断。在极度困难的情况下，这两个市的工人千方百计设法上班，大路不通就绕道走小巷，没有公共汽车就改骑自行车和步行，使生产的各个环节照样正常运转。
