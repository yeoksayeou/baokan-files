Since June 4th, the Lanzhou area has experienced significant turmoil. The most prominent issue has been the dissemination of political rumors by a small number of individuals, inciting the people against the Party, the government, the People's Liberation Army, public security officers, and the People's Armed Police. There have been four instances of blocking trains, causing repeated disruptions on the Longhai Line. In the main streets and key bridges of Lanzhou City, barricades were set up, obstructing public transportation. Workers were incited to go on strike, severely impacting the production of several key enterprises.

Faced with this serious situation, the Gansu Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government took decisive measures to resolutely stop the turmoil. Public security officers, in coordination with the People's Armed Police, have taken firm action against lawbreakers and various criminal elements that disrupt social order. Since June 7th, 32 individuals from the so-called "Citizens' Support Group" and "Suicide Squad" have been arrested, and further actions are being taken to completely dismantle these criminal gangs. Party and government officials, along with Communist Party members, have left their offices to work with grassroots political organizations, factories, enterprises, and public security officers to jointly remove the barricades. Starting from the 8th, all barricades in the city have been removed, and public buses have resumed operation. By the 9th, nine enterprises that had stopped production or were partially shut down due to the disturbances have all resumed normal operations. The "Autonomous Federation of University Students" and other illegal organizations have voluntarily dismantled their broadcast stations set up in the city center and the Qilihe District.

　　坚决制止动乱
    兰州秩序恢复正常
    本报兰州６月１０日电  ６月４日以来，兰州地区发生了相当严重的混乱。最突出的是，极少数人大肆散布政治谣言，挑拨人民群众同党、政府、解放军、公安干警和武警部队的关系；先后四次坐轨拦截火车，使陇海线几度中断；在兰州市区的主要交通路口、重要桥梁设置路障，阻断公共交通；煽动工人罢工，使一些大型骨干企业生产受到严重影响。
    面对这种严重局势，甘肃省委、省政府采取一系列果断措施，坚决制止动乱。广大公安干警同武警部队协同作战，坚决打击了扰乱社会治安的不法分子和各种刑事犯罪分子。６月７日以来，先后抓捕了３２名所谓“市民声援团”、“敢死队”的不法分子，并正在采取进一步行动，彻底摧垮各种犯罪团伙。党政机关干部、共产党员走出机关，配合基层政权组织、厂矿企业和公安干警，共同拆除路障。从８日开始，市区路障已全部拆除，市内各路公共汽车开始运营。到９日，前几天因受冲击停工或半停工的九个企业，已全部恢复生产。兰州大学“高自联”等非法组织主动拆除了设在市中心广场和七里河区的广播站。
