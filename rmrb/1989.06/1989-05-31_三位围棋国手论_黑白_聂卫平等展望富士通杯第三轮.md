Predicting high-level Go tournaments is becoming increasingly difficult, and writing about them often feels like betting or fortune-telling, but perhaps that is part of the fun. Today (June 1), Ma Xiaochun and Liu Xiaoguang from China will depart for Tokyo to participate in the third round of the Fujitsu World Professional Go Championship. Their opponents will be Rin Kaiho and Takeyama Michiharu, and both matches will be their first encounters. Before their departure, I interviewed Ma Xiaochun, Liu Xiaoguang, and China's national team coach Nie Weiping. I found that the three top players had some interesting views on the "black and white" issue.

Nie Weiping said: Optimistically speaking, I think one of Ma and Liu will win. However, there is also the issue of drawing lots to determine who goes first. There is a difference between playing black and white. Obviously, if the so-called "cosmic style" player Takeyama Michiharu gets the black stones, it will be disadvantageous for Liu Xiaoguang, who is not good at white layouts. As for Ma Xiaochun, who is proficient in both black and white layouts, he also has this problem because Rin Kaiho's chess skills are comprehensive and he has a strong ability to balance the entire board. Therefore, I hope they both draw black stones.

Ma Xiaochun's views are quite similar to Nie Weiping's. He said: Rin Kaiho's chess style is close to the kung fu style, with no particularly brilliant moves and few bad moves. Therefore, if he gets the black stones, he will play more solidly, making it harder to deal with. "You see, right?" he asked Liu Xiaoguang. Liu Xiaoguang said: "More or less like that." However, Liu Xiaoguang disagreed with Ma Xiaochun's view that Takeyama Michiharu is rigidly sticking to the cosmic style and not letting go. This view originated from the commentary on the match last year where Jiang Jieqi defeated Takeyama Michiharu in the first round of the Ing Cup. Ma Xiaochun believed that Takeyama Michiharu won the draw, but in the situation of attaching eight points, Takeyama still chose black. Obviously, Ma Xiaochun thought that the burden of attaching eight points (equivalent to attaching seven and a half points) was too heavy.

"I don't think the outcome depends on the additional two points," Liu Xiaoguang said. The confidence of Liu Xiaoguang, who defeated Cho Chikun in the second round of the Fujitsu Cup, has obviously grown. He said: "Takeyama Michiharu's style is distinct, and this time when facing him, I have not thought of any special strategies. I will play as I normally do, of course, I will try to avoid following his pace."

Liu Xiaoguang did not explicitly state that he hoped to draw black stones, it seems that this big-killing player does not place his hopes on black and white. The success of defeating Cho Chikun in the previous round has injected a strong stimulant into him. He is prepared to have a life-or-death struggle with Takeyama Michiharu in the "central area," either a big loss or a big win. Liu Xiaoguang said that if he gets the white stones, he will likely play a double star to compete with Takeyama; but if he gets the black stones, he will play a star-small knight.

Nie Weiping said, on the afternoon of June 3, I will go to the television station to commentate on these two games. Originally, I really wanted to have another match with Rin Kaiho, but because I lost to Wang Mingyuan from Taipei, I don't have the chance this time. I hope Ma Xiaochun can have an outstanding performance. I will go to commentate on the games for Ma and Liu, and my mood will be more relaxed. I hope they both win.

### 三位围棋国手论“黑白”——聂卫平等展望富士通杯第三轮

　　三位围棋国手论“黑白” 
    ——聂卫平等展望富士通杯第三轮
    本报记者  张抒
    高水平围棋大赛的预测越来越难，文章作起来常有押宝算命的味道，但也许这正是趣味所在。今天（６月１日），中方马晓春、刘小光启程赴日，将在东京参加富士通世界职业围棋锦标赛的第三轮比赛，两人的对手分别是林海峰和武宫正树，而且都是初次交锋。行前，记者采访了马晓春、刘小光及中国队总教练聂卫平，发现三位国手的“黑白问题”论很有点意思。
    聂卫平说：乐观地讲，我看马、刘二人中有一人会胜。不过这里还有一个抽签猜先的问题，执黑棋还是白棋是有些差别的。显然，如果号称“宇宙流”的武宫正树拿着黑棋，对白布局不擅长的刘小光肯定是不利的。至于说黑白布局都全面的马晓春也不是没有这个问题，因为林海峰的棋技全面，全局平衡能力强，拿到黑棋更难对付。故我希望他们都猜到黑棋。
    马晓春的看法和聂卫平比较一致。他说：林海峰的棋接近于功夫棋的类型，虽没什么鲜招，也少有坏棋，因此他拿黑棋，会走得更厚实，因而也要难对付一些。“你看是不是这样？”他问刘小光。刘小光说：“差不多是这样吧。”不过，刘小光不同意马晓春对武宫正树的“墨守成规”，死抱着宇宙流不放的说法，此说起因于评论去年江铸久在应氏杯首轮击败武宫正树的那盘棋。马晓春认为当时猜先武宫得手，但是在贴八点的情况下，武宫还是选择了黑棋。显然马晓春认为贴八点（等于贴七目半）的负担太重了些。
    “我看胜负不在这多贴了两目”。刘小光说。在富士通杯第二轮杀得赵治勋一塌糊涂的刘小光信心显然大长了。他说：“武宫正树的棋风鲜明，这次与他交锋，我并没有想什么专门的对策，该怎么下就怎么下，当然我要尽量避免跟着他的步调。”
    刘小光没有明确表示希望能猜到黑棋，看来这位大杀大砍的棋手，似乎并没把希望寄托在黑白上。上一轮大胜赵治勋的成功为他注入了强有力的兴奋剂，他准备在“中原”一带与武宫正树来个鱼死网破，不是大输便是大胜。刘小光说，如果他拿白棋，他很可能会走个二连星以与武宫抗衡；但如拿到黑棋，他会走个星小目。
    聂卫平说，６月３日下午我要去电视台讲解这两盘棋，本来我很想与林海峰再交一次手，但因输给台北王铭琬，这次没机会了。我希望马晓春能有出色表演，我去给马、刘二人讲棋，心情更轻松些，我希望他们两个都能赢。
