Economics contains culture, and culture contains economics. How can we promote the integration of economics and culture? The proposal by Minister of Commerce Hu Ping to establish "commercial cultural studies" is very meaningful.

To do a good job in economic work, we need to study the cultural connotations contained in various types of economics. Although economic work inevitably involves the exchange of goods, this exchange of goods necessarily involves people. People's cultural literacy and the cultural environment in which they live are different, especially the cultural psychological qualities of different ethnic groups. Studying the culture in economics, on the one hand, helps to understand various cultural phenomena more deeply, on the other hand, it can improve economic work by targeting people with different cultural customs and backgrounds. When people reach a consensus, the exchange of goods will be smoother.

The significance of integrating economics and culture also lies in the fact that economic work needs theoretical guidance. Theory belongs to the category of culture. Many leading cadres on the economic front have been busy for decades, day after day, what is called "opening eyes, busy until the lights go out." Busy as they are, the way they handle practical affairs is "long-term and consistent," and the effectiveness is also difficult to improve. Even when the situation develops, old methods are no longer effective, so there is often a feeling of hard work for little result. The reason is that they emphasize experience over theory. Practice has shown that whether it is macroeconomics, microeconomics, or departmental economics, there are laws to follow. Developing economic cultural studies will greatly benefit the improvement of the level of economic work.

So far, the integration of economics and culture can be said to have just begun, with few successful examples and few beneficial results. This is related to the lack of recognition of its necessity, especially to the fact that a considerable number of leaders have not yet recognized its significance. Leaders need to be the "matchmakers under the moonlight" for the integration of economics and culture, with courage and insight. This courage is to dare to discard old methods and dare to innovate in work methods. This insight is to be good at discovering the appropriate intersection of economics and culture, so that culture and economics can truly produce beneficial results. If there are many people with courage and insight to lead the way, pave the way, and build bridges, new disciplines like "commercial cultural studies" will surely flourish quickly.

    善做“月下佬”
    瓯亮
    经济里面有文化，文化里面也有经济。如何促使经济与文化结合呢？商业部长胡平倡导建立“商业文化学”，是很有意义的。
    搞好经济工作，需要研究各门类经济中所包含的文化内涵。因为经济工作中，虽然少不得物与物的交换，但这种物物交换必然有人参与其间。而人的文化素养、人所处的文化环境是不同的，特别是各民族的文化心理素质存在着差异。研究经济中的文化，一方面有助于更深刻地理解形形色色的文化现象，一方面又可针对具有不同文化习俗、文化背景的人们改进经济工作。人与人之间形成了共识，物物交换便会更加顺畅。
    经济与文化结合，其意义还在于经济工作需要理论做指导。理论属于文化的范畴。我们经济战线不少领导干部，几十年日复一日地忙，叫做“两眼一睁，忙到熄灯”。忙则忙矣，处理实际事务的方式“长期一贯制”，处理效果也很难提高，甚至形势一发展，老办法不灵了，因而每有心劳日拙之感。其原因就在于重经验而轻理论。实践表明，宏观经济也好，微观经济也好，部门经济也好，都有其规律可循。发展经济文化学，大有益于提高经济工作的水平。
    迄今，经济与文化结合，可以说刚刚开始，佳偶不多，产生的宁馨儿也不多。这和人们对必要性认识不足有关，尤其与相当数量的领导尚未认识其意义有关。领导人要做经济与文化结亲的“月下佬”，需有胆，有识。这胆，就是在工作方法上勇于抛弃老一套，敢于弃旧图新。这识，就是要善于发现经济与文化恰当的结合部，使文化与经济结亲，真正地产生出有益的成果来。若有了大批有胆有识的人鸣锣开道，铺路架桥，“商业文化学”这样的新学科必定会很快地繁荣昌盛起来。
