The bonds have a repayment period of three years, with an annual interest rate that floats with the three-year fixed-term savings deposit interest rate set by the People's Bank, plus a value-preservation supplement rate, and an additional one percentage point.

	2. The interest on the 1989 Value-Preserving Bonds is calculated from the date of purchase, with principal and interest paid upon maturity after three years. No compound interest is calculated, and early redemption or late redemption without interest is not allowed. Individual citizens' income from purchasing the 1989 Value-Preserving Bonds is exempt from personal income adjustment tax.

	3. The 1989 Value-Preserving Bonds are denominated in yuan, with face values of 20 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan. The bonds are non-named, non-loss, can be pledged to banks, and can be transferred at designated national locations.

	4. The 1989 Value-Preserving Bonds will be issued starting from July 1, 1989, and will end on December 31, 1989.

	5. The issuance quota of the 1989 Value-Preserving Bonds is allocated to the people's governments of various provinces, autonomous regions, municipalities directly under the Central Government, and municipalities with separate plans. All levels of government must complete the allocated sales tasks. The remaining portion after sales will be purchased by various levels of government using local budgetary funds outside the plan. All levels of people's governments should organize various specialized banks and financial, postal, and other departments to handle the sales through multiple channels. The Ministry of Finance will allocate sales funds according to the sales amount.

	6. The Ministry of Finance is responsible for the repayment of principal and interest on the value-preserving bonds, and various handling units will handle the redemption.

	The issuance of 12 billion yuan in value-preserving bonds is an important task. All levels of people's governments and relevant departments of the State Council must strengthen organizational leadership and, together with various levels of propaganda departments and mass organizations such as workers, youth, and women, do a good job of propaganda and mobilization to ensure the smooth completion of the issuance task.
