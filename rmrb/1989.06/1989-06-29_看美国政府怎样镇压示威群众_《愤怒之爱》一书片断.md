Editor's Note: After the PLA martial law troops, the People's Armed Police, and public security officers suppressed the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, U.S. government officials and congressmen maliciously slandered and attacked our country, as if the U.S. government were a "protector of human rights." Now we excerpt a passage from "Angry Love" by Taiwanese writer Nan Fangshuo, to let the world see how the U.S. government brutally suppresses protesters.

It should be particularly noted that our country suppressed a counter-revolutionary riot, while the U.S. government suppressed the democratic movement of the American people. The two are fundamentally different in nature. We publish these materials to let readers see the brutal, anti-people, and anti-democratic nature of the U.S. government, and to expose its hypocritical face.

In the 1960s, African Americans faced the peak of segregation, discrimination, and oppression. Therefore, on February 1, 1960, the North Carolina incident ignited the torch of the African American struggle for civil rights. Sit-ins and protests began in black colleges and universities across the South.

Two thousand arrested: Between 1960 and 1963, approximately 20,000 people were arrested in the South for marching or sitting in protest. The non-violent student protests of the early 1960s did not escape the threat of violence. For example, on a bloody night in Danville, 65 protesters were beaten by police, with 47 sent to the emergency room for treatment. In the summer of 1963, protests reached their peak. The authorities legalized police violence; many black churches holding meetings were burned down, and many black families were shot at by snipers. On May 10, the headquarters of the Birmingham protesters – the Gaston Motel – and the home of protest leader King were both bombed. On June 12, 1963, the secretary of the Mississippi NAACP, Evers, was assassinated.

Military occupation of schools for a year: In Cambridge, Maryland, due to continuous protests and hundreds of arrests, the National Guard occupied the city and imposed martial law for a year. In May, 1,000 people were arrested in Greensboro, North Carolina, 1,400 in Durham, and 1,400 in Bridgeport, South Carolina, in September.

In November 1963, students at the University of California in the Bay Area protested for civil rights, resulting in the arrest of 1,300 people.

In the summer of 1967, anti-Vietnam War protests broke out. During this period, at least 57 black communities in the North, including Newark and Detroit, saw protests, and the handling of the situation by the police and the National Guard was shocking. In Newark, at least 24 blacks were killed, and in Detroit, 43 people died. At least 10 people died in other places.

On June 23, a police force brutally suppressed an anti-war march in Los Angeles, arresting 51 people and injuring 40 who were sent to the hospital. On June 26, the chairman of the "Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee," Brown, was arrested on charges of "rioting." In July, President Johnson instructed all officials, "Do not analyze, but end social disorder." Additionally, Johnson and other high-ranking officials notified the "U.S. Army Intelligence Agency" to strengthen surveillance of discontented political groups and immediately send the information to the FBI and local police departments.

Beat with rifle butts at the door: In the fall of 1967, there were anti-war and anti-draft protests at 106 universities. In the capital, the protest in front of the Pentagon on October 21 was the most spectacular. That noon, over 100,000 people, mostly students, along with the elderly and women, marched to protest under the full armor of military police. The military police had bayonets fixed and were lined up to confront the crowd. Anyone who crossed the warning line was immediately arrested. However, a group of radical youths still rushed through the blockade to the door, but were beaten with rifle butts by soldiers inside and then arrested. In this massive protest, 700 people were arrested and 1,400 were injured.

After the Pentagon protest, the U.S. government heightened its vigilance and strengthened its suppression. President Johnson ordered his subordinates to "pay complete attention to all disorderly events" and established a high-level presidential special committee to unify command. The U.S. Department of Defense expanded its intelligence network until it collected information on 18,000 radicals and established two major files before the Attorney General knew. The personnel of the military training department of the schools also began to closely monitor radical students. The draft board notified all draft centers to immediately list all anti-draft elements as 1-A and draft them immediately to the Vietnam battlefield.

Military enters over 100 universities: On April 4, 1968, Dr. King was assassinated in a hotel in Memphis, Tennessee. This event sparked a frenzy, and there were riots of varying scales in 100 cities. FBI Director Hoover said, "The riots in April resulted in more than 60 deaths, thousands of injuries, and millions of dollars in property damage." Federal troops entered major cities like Chicago, with a total of 88,700 troops deployed.

In the fall of 1968, at least 21 universities called in police, with at least 1,265 people arrested.

In the spring semester of 1969, the National Guard and police were called into 127 campuses to restore order. From January to June, 4,000 people were arrested, and 1,000 were expelled. Many students were handed over to the courts by their schools for prosecution.

On the evening of October 8, 1969, a crowd gathered in Lincoln Park, Chicago, but the police were already on high alert. They used riot batons to strike people's heads, faces, chests, and feet, with blood gushing from many people's heads and mouths. Twice, police cars rammed into protesters, throwing people under the wheels and into the air. A police officer fired at three people, hitting one in the head. The first clash resulted in at least six people being shot, 68 arrested, and an unknown number of injuries. After a day of calm, the Weather Underground organized a protest of over 200 people, while the authorities had 2,500 armed National Guard troops. The clash resulted in 130 arrests and many serious injuries.

Arrested 14,000 students in two years: On April 30, 1970, Nixon ordered the invasion of Cambodia. Within a few days, campus protests erupted, with 60-odd universities declaring protests.

On May 4, 28 National Guardsmen with long and short guns entered Kent State University without warning and fired at over 200 protesters. Four students were killed on the spot, nine were injured, and one was paralyzed for life. From May 5 to May 8, at least half of the 1,350 universities across the country were involved. From May 1 to May 15, 1,800 students were arrested.

Many schools were occupied by the military, and several states declared all schools in a state of emergency. In 16 states, 21 universities had National Guard troops patrolling 24 hours a day.

The FBI immediately computerized its operations, strengthened its eavesdropping and surveillance equipment, and added 1,200 new agents. Therefore, in 1970-1971, based on these materials, 14,565 people were arrested in succession.

　　看美国政府怎样镇压示威群众
    ——《愤怒之爱》一书片断
    编者按：解放军戒严部队、武警部队和公安干警平息了北京发生的反革命暴乱以后，美国政府官员、国会议员肆意对我国进行诬蔑和攻击，似乎美国政府是“人权保护者”。现在我们摘录台湾作家南方朔所著《愤怒之爱》一书中的片断，让世人看看美国政府是怎样残酷镇压示威群众的。
    这里要特别指出，我国平息的是一场反革命暴乱，美国政府镇压的是美国人民的民主运动，两者性质根本不同。我们发表这批材料，是要让读者看清美国政府反人民、反民主的残暴本性，并识破它的伪善面目。
    六十年代，美国黑人遭到了被隔离、歧视、压迫的高峰。因此，一九六○年二月一日起，北卡罗来纳事件便点燃了黑人争取民权的火炬。静坐示威在南部各城市中的黑人院校中展开，学生们开始行动。
    两万人被捕　在一九六○至一九六三年之间，在南部约有二万人因游行示威或静坐抗议而被捕。六十年代初期的学生非暴力示威行动未能免除暴力的威吓。例如，在丹维尔的一个血腥的夜晚，六十五名示威者被警察痛殴，其中四十七人送急诊救治。一九六三年夏天，示威走向高峰，当局使警察暴力合法化，许多南方黑人集会的教堂被焚毁，许多黑人家庭遭冷枪射击；五月十日，伯明罕的示威者总部——加斯吞旅舍以及示威领袖金氏的家都被炸毁，一九六三年六月十二日，密西西比州“有色人种促进会”的秘书依华斯被刺。
    军队驻占学校一年　在马里兰州剑桥，由于示威不断，被捕者数百人，结果国防军驻占，实施戒严法达一年之久。五月间，北卡罗来纳州的绿堡有一千人被捕，杜汉有一千四百人被捕，九月在南卡罗来纳州的桥堡则有一千四百人被捕。
    一九六三年十一月，加州大学学生在湾区从事民权运动的抗议游行，有一千三百多人被捕。
    一九六七年夏，发生了反越战的示威游行，这一期间在纽瓦克和底特律等至少五十七个北方黑人社区发生了抗议事件，而警察及国防军的处置也使人惊讶！在纽瓦克至少有二十四个黑人丧生，底特律则有四十三人死亡。其他地方至少十人死亡。
    接着，六月二十三日，洛杉矶的一次反战游行队伍被警察强力镇压，被捕五十一人，四十人受伤进了医院。六月二十六日，“学生非暴力支援委员会”主席布朗被捕，罪名是“暴动”。七月份，约翰逊总统通知所有官员，“不要去分析，而是要结束社会的无秩序”。另外，詹森和其他高级官员也通知军部的“大陆美国情报局”加强对不满政治团体的监视，并将情报立即送联邦调查局、地方警察局。
    冲到门口就用枪托打　一九六七年的秋天，在一百零六所大学有过反战反征兵示威。而在首都，一九六七年十月二十一日的五角大厦前示威最为壮观。这天中午，十万以上群众，学生为主，其他尚有老人和妇女等，在军警全副武装的情况下前往示威，军警均刺刀上鞘，列阵以对，人群只要一过警戒线立即被捕。但还是有一群激进青年冲进封锁线到了门口，但被里面冲出的军人用枪托痛击，然后被捕。在这次规模巨大的群众示威中，有七百人被捕。一千四百人受伤。
    五角大厦示威事件之后，促使美国政府提高警觉和加强镇压。约翰逊总统要求所属对“所有混乱的事件完全注意”，并成立了一个高阶层的总统特别小组统一指挥。美国国防部扩大它的情报网，一直到这个情报网收集到一万八千名激进分子的资料并建立两大档案后，首席检察长才知道，学校的学生军训处人员也开始密切监视学校的激进分子。征兵处通知所有的征兵中心，要立刻将所有反征兵分子都列为—Ａ级，立即征召，送到越南战场。
    军队进入一百多所大学　一九六八年四月四日，金恩博士在田纳西州孟菲斯的一间旅馆被刺。这个事件激起了狂潮，在一百个城市就有了大小规模不等的黑人暴动。联邦调查局长胡佛说：“四月份的暴乱造成了六十人以上死亡，数千人受伤，数百万财产受损。”联邦军队进入了芝加哥等大都市，出动军力高达八万八千七百人。
    一九六八年秋至少有二十一所大学召警察入校，被捕者至少一千二百六十五人。
    一九六九年春季学期，国防军和警察被召入一百二十七所校园平乱，一月到六月被捕者多达四千人，有一千人被开除。许多学生被学校送交法院起诉。
    一九六九年十月八日晚，群众在芝加哥林肯公园开大会，但警察早已严阵以待，他们用镇暴棍猛击人们的头、脸、胸、脚，许多人鲜血从头上和口中涌出。有两次警车向示威者身上冲，把人弹向轮下和天空，一个警察向三人开枪，打中一人的头部。第一次冲突结果，至少有六人被枪击，六十八人被捕，受伤者无法统计。静止了大概一天，又发生了气象人党二百多人示威，而官方则是二千五百名荷枪实弹的国防军，接着冲突发生，一百三十人被捕，许多人受重伤。
    两年逮捕学生一万四千多　一九七○年四月三十日，尼克松下令进军柬埔寨，几天内校园抗议事件不断，六十几所大学宣布示威。
    五月四日，有二十八名国防军士携带长短枪进入肯特州立大学，没有事先警告，就向二百多个示威者射击，四名学生当场死亡，九人受伤，一人终生瘫痪。从五月五日到五月八日，美国全国大学一千三百五十所，至少半数卷了进去，从五月一日到五月十五日，学生被捕计一千八百人。
    许多学校由军人占领，好几个州宣布所有学校进入紧急状态，有十六个州的二十一所大学，国防军二十四小时全天候巡逻。
    ——联邦调查局立即电脑化，加强监听和监视装备，增加一千二百名新特务。因此后来在一九七○至一九七一年，根据这些资料陆续逮捕了一万四千五百六十五人。
