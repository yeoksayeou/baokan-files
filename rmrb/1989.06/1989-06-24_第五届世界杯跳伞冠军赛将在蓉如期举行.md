The Fifth World Cup Parachuting Championship will be held in Chengdu as scheduled.

Our reporter Luomaocheng reports from Chengdu on June 24: The director of the organizing committee for the Fifth World Cup Parachuting Championship and Vice Governor of Sichuan Province, Han Bangyan, announced today that the competition will be held in Chengdu as scheduled.

Han Bangyan said that in the previous period, a counter-revolutionary riot occurred in Beijing, and a small group of thugs caused serious disturbances in Chengdu, including looting and arson. Now, the situation has calmed down, and social order is improving. We are fully confident that this competition will be held in Chengdu on October 13, 1989, as scheduled. We sincerely look forward to the participation of parachuting champions from all over the world to compete, exchange skills, and foster friendship.

　　第五届世界杯跳伞冠军赛将在蓉如期举行
    本报成都６月２４日电  记者罗茂城报道：第五届世界杯跳伞冠军赛组织委员会主任、四川省副省长韩邦彦今天宣布：比赛将在成都如期举行。
    韩邦彦说，前一段时间北京发生了反革命暴乱，在成都也发生了一小撮歹徒打砸抢烧的严重骚乱，现在均已恢复了平静，社会秩序正在朝着好的方向发展。我们完全有把握使这次竞赛于１９８９年１０月１３日在成都如期举行，热诚地期待世界各国的跳伞冠军们前来拚搏竞赛、切磋技艺、增进友谊。
