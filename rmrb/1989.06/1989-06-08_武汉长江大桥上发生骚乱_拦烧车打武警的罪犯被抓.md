Wuhan's public security organs have captured several ringleaders who caused a disturbance on the Wuhan Yangtze River Bridge by overturning and burning vehicles, blocking trains, and assaulting on-duty armed police officers.

According to Wu Han's public security bureau spokesperson Cai Chengde, on the morning of June 7th, some unidentified individuals took advantage of the disorderly situation caused by a gathering of students from several universities at the Dadaomen area in Wuchang. They set up roadblocks using dismantled road barriers and let the air out of the tires of passing public buses and trams, causing long-term traffic congestion. Around 11 a.m., a group of people took advantage of the chaos to overturn a public bus on the southern approach of the Yangtze River Bridge, remove the fuel line, and set it on fire. In the chaos, some people knocked over a section of the iron fence and a guardhouse on the west side of the railway bridge, and placed a large piece of rail on the railway track to block the train, causing the Beijing-Guangzhou railway line to be interrupted again for 10 hours. In the afternoon, some people removed the guardrails, smashed the hanging lights, and broke the glass windows and doors in the lower layer of the bridgehead fort in Wuchang. They threw two motorcycles and several bicycles belonging to the public security and railway departments into the Yangtze River. A released criminal named Chen Wei, who had been released from re-education through labor for one and a half years, shouted, "It's chaotic now, the opportunity has come!" They used coal blocks to injure four on-duty armed police officers. Several other criminals dumped the lunch of dozens of armed police officers on duty on the Yangtze River Bridge into the river.

The spokesperson for the Wuhan Public Security Bureau said that the public security organs have arrested 23 ringleaders of the disturbance, including Hu Liangbing, Yang Gechuan, Chen Wei, and Jin Tao. They are all idle social elements or released prisoners who have not been reformed, as well as temporary workers from other places, and none of them are students. The case is currently under further investigation.

It is reported that in the past few days, Wuhan has also seen several incidents of looting watermelons, publicly insulting and molesting women, and leading attacks on the Yangtze River Hotel, with the ringleaders of these criminal activities being taken into custody for investigation.

　　武汉长江大桥上发生骚乱
    拦烧车打武警的罪犯被抓
    新华社武汉６月８日电  （记者方政军、通讯员鲁艺兵）武汉市公安机关发言人今天在这里说，昨天在武汉长江大桥上掀翻并烧毁汽车、拦截列车、打伤值勤武警战士的几名为首刑事犯罪分子，已被公安机关抓获归案。
    据武汉市公安局新闻发言人蔡承德介绍，６月７日上午，一些不明身份的人乘一些高校学生在武昌大东门地区集会秩序比较混乱之机，先在武昌大东门地段用拆除的公路交通护栏设置路障，并将路过的几辆公共汽车和电车的车胎气放掉，造成交通长时间阻塞。上午１１时许，一伙人又乘混乱之机在长江大桥南端的引桥上掀翻一辆公共汽车，拔掉油管，纵火烧毁。混乱之中，一些人掀倒了大桥铁路桥西侧的一段铁栅栏和一座岗亭，并将一根大铁轨搬到铁路轨道上拦截列车，致使这一段京广铁路干线又一次被中断达１０小时。下午，一些人在武昌长江大桥桥头堡内底层拆护栏，击吊灯，砸碎门窗玻璃，将公安和铁路部门值勤的两台摩托车和数辆自行车摔入长江。因流氓犯罪劳教一年半刚释放的陈伟叫喊说：“现在乱了，机会来了！”他们用煤块砸伤４名值勤武警战士。还有几名歹徒将几十名在长江大桥上值勤武警的中餐饭菜全部倒入江中。
    武汉市公安局发言人说，公安机关当天已将这次闹事的为首分子胡良兵、杨革闯、陈伟、金涛等２３人抓获。他们均属社会闲杂人员或未改造好的劳改劳教释放人员以及外地来汉的临时工，没有一名是学生。目前，此案正在进一步审理。
    据悉，武汉市这几天还发生了几起哄抢西瓜、当众调戏侮辱妇女、带头冲击长江大酒店等流氓活动，为首罪犯均被收容审查。
