A few students are still sitting in front of Zhongnanhai's Xinhuamen. The State Council's spokesperson made a statement regarding this matter, pointing out that Xinhuamen is the gate of the Chinese people's Zhongnanhai, a crucial passage for important diplomatic and state affairs. Currently, some students are sitting in front of Xinhuamen, blocking traffic, disrupting normal order, and hindering the Party and the state's important official business. This behavior, which disregards the bigger picture and violates laws and regulations, cannot continue. It should be noted that the government has been very restrained in handling the issue of students sitting in front of Xinhuamen. It is hoped that the students sitting in front of Xinhuamen will not ignore the government's advice, will abide by laws and regulations, and will promptly end their sit-in, cooperating with the government and the security forces to restore and maintain normal order in front of Xinhuamen.

According to relevant departments, since May 17th, a small number of students from several universities in the capital have been continuously sitting in front of Zhongnanhai's Xinhuamen, causing a bad influence. In recent days, relevant departments of the State Council and responsible officials from relevant universities, with the spirit of caring for and cherishing students, have been continuously doing guidance work for the sitting students, reasoning with them and persuading them to leave Xinhuamen promptly and return to school. After several days of effort, some students have gradually left Xinhuamen, but a few dozen students from a few universities still refuse to leave. Early this morning, Vice Minister of Justice Lu Jian, Vice Minister of Metallurgy Xu Daqian, and relevant responsible officials from the China University of Political Science and Law, Beijing University of Technology, and Beijing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics, as well as some professors and lecturers, once again did work separately for the sitting students from their respective universities, persuading them to leave. After patient guidance, some students left Xinhuamen. However, students from the China University of Political Science and Law and Beijing University of Technology still insist on sitting. The sitting students said that this was supposedly directed by the "Beijing Students Autonomous Federation" to persist in sitting in front of Xinhuamen.

　　少数学生仍在新华门前静坐
    国办发言人劝他们尽快离去
    新华社北京５月３１日电  国务院办公厅发言人就极少数学生在中南海新华门前静坐一事发表谈话指出，新华门是中国人民的新华门，是进行重要外事活动和国务活动的必经之门。现在一些学生在新华门前静坐，堵塞了交通，破坏了正常秩序，妨碍了党和国家的重要公务。这种不顾大局、违犯法纪的行为是不能持续下去的。应当指出，政府对处理新华门前学生静坐问题是十分克制的。希望在新华门前静坐的学生不要无视政府的劝告，要遵纪守法，尽快结束静坐，配合政府和警卫部队恢复和维护新华门前的正常秩序。
    据有关部门介绍，自５月１７日以来，首都几所高校的极少数学生一直在中南海新华门前静坐，造成了很坏的影响。连日来，国务院有关部门和有关院校的负责同志本着关心学生、爱护学生的精神，不断对静坐的学生做疏导工作，晓之以理，规劝他们尽快离开新华门，回校复课。经过几天的努力，一些学生陆续离开了新华门，但仍有几所高校的三十几名学生不走。今天凌晨，司法部副部长鲁坚、冶金部副部长徐大铨和中国政法大学、北京科技大学、北京航空航天大学的有关负责同志以及部分教授、讲师，再次分别对所属高校静坐的学生做工作，劝说他们离去。经过耐心地疏导，有些学生离开了新华门，中国政法大学、北京科技大学仍有一些学生坚持静坐。静坐的学生表示，这是所谓的“高自联”指示他们坚持在新华门前静坐的。
