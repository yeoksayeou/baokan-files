Vsevolod Ovchinnikov has gray hair, a calm demeanor, and the air of a scholar.

This representative of the Soviet press, who accompanied Soviet leader Gorbachev on his visit to China, spoke with great emotion during an interview at the "International Hotel": "I am incredibly happy to have lived to see this day: a tragic chapter of 30 years of quarrels, confrontation, and coldness has finally ended, and the high-level meeting between China and the Soviet Union has opened a new page in the history of relations between the two countries."

Ovchinnikov's words were a genuine expression of his feelings. This veteran Soviet journalist, who has been reporting on China since the founding of the People's Republic, interviewed "General Peng" three times during the Korean War, and crossed the Yalu River alongside Chinese volunteers, has believed for 30 years that the clouds in Sino-Soviet relations would dissipate and that the sunshine of friendship would once again shine on the two neighboring countries. For 30 years, he has closely watched and studied everything that has happened in the China he loves, becoming a top expert on China in the Soviet Union. Not long ago, when someone internationally criticized China for "violating human rights" over the issue of Tibet, Ovchinnikov stood up and spoke out. As the first foreign journalist to visit Tibet after its peaceful liberation, he wrote in "Truth" newspaper, using a large amount of facts to explain how cruel and grim the serfdom system in Tibet was at that time, and how the people of Tibet under the serfdom system had no basic "human rights" to speak of? Ovchinnikov has a deep understanding and unique insights into China's economic reforms. He has not once published articles on China's economic reforms, fully affirming the achievements China has made in its economic reforms, while also pointing out the problems and drawbacks that have arisen, hoping that his own country can learn from them.

"Today, the foundation of Sino-Soviet relations is more solid than ever before, because we no longer oppose each other, but we are also no longer allies," Ovchinnikov said confidently. "'Alliance' itself does not fit today's reality. In today's world, war is giving way to dialogue, and tension is giving way to relaxation. In such a situation, an alliance is not the best form of state relations. Peaceful coexistence is the best foundation for relations between countries. However, for these two socialist powers, peaceful coexistence should not only mean no war, but also strengthening cooperation and good-neighborly relations."

Ovchinnikov believes that both China and the Soviet Union are carrying out reforms, and the difficulties and problems they encounter are quite similar. Expanding enterprise autonomy and the formation of a market mechanism have injected great vitality into the economy; however, at the same time, they have also produced negative phenomena such as localism and regionalism, and no one wants to produce those necessary and inexpensive small commodities. The diversification of the economy and the dual-track pricing system have also created conditions for the emergence of "official profiteering." He smiled and said, "Our 'official profiteering' has not yet become a disaster, but inflation is indeed quite serious."

"Yes, we have astonishing similarities. But we each have our own characteristics, solving our own problems, and walking our own paths. We are all wiser than before and have understood the truth that 'we cannot only export revolution, but also export reform models.' But this does not prevent us from studying and learning from each other's experiences and lessons, does it?" he asked seriously.

Yes, of course. But what exactly should we learn from each other? To my question, Ovchinnikov thought for a moment before answering: "Some people say that China has achieved remarkable results in economic reform, while we have taken bigger steps in political reform. I am not sure if this statement is correct, but the Soviet Union should indeed learn from China's courage in economic reform, learn from China's effective open policy, and learn from China's fruitful experience of establishing economic special zones. We highly appreciate China's achievements in developing joint ventures. Now China has 18,000 joint ventures, while we temporarily have only 200. Our people have not yet felt the benefits of reform. If Chinese comrades study our political reforms, they should see that the principle of 'openness' and democratization on the one hand greatly mobilized the political enthusiasm of all social strata, and on the other hand also caused various long-accumulated social problems to erupt, such as ethnic problems...

In short, when either side studies the other's experience, it should also seriously summarize its lessons. Lessons are equally beneficial."

"For example, last year, a sudden wave of panic buying swept through China, and inflation struck the Chinese economy and the pockets of ordinary people. Not long after, Gorbachev announced in Kiev, Ukraine, that the Soviet Union would not carry out price reforms in the next two or three years. Look, this is a clear example of learning from lessons!" We both laughed.

As we shook hands to say goodbye, Ovchinnikov enthusiastically said to me, "Our newspaper eagerly looks forward to establishing contact with the People's Daily. I personally hope to visit your ancient yet young country again on the occasion of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China."

　　“我为活到今天而感到无比幸福！”    
    ——访苏联《真理报》评论员奥夫钦尼科夫
    李惠生
    弗谢沃洛德·奥夫钦尼科夫头发灰白，举止安详，一派学者风度。
    这位随同苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫一起前来访华的苏联新闻界代表在“国际饭店”接受我的采访时，很动感情地说：“我为活到了今天而感到无比幸福：３０年争吵、对抗和冷淡的悲剧性一页终成过去，中苏高级会晤揭开了两国关系史上全新的一页。”
    奥夫钦尼科夫这一番话是他真情的流露。这位自新中国诞生之日起就从事对中国的报道，抗美援朝时曾三次采访“彭大将军”，同中国志愿军并肩跨过鸭绿江的老一辈苏联新闻工作者，３０年来一直相信两国关系中的阴云会消散，友谊的阳光会重新照耀两个邻邦。３０年来，他一直注视、研究着他所喜爱的中国所发生的一切，成为苏联的第一流中国问题专家。不久前，当国际上有人就西藏问题指责中国“侵犯人权”的时候，奥夫钦尼科夫挺身而出，仗义执言。他以西藏和平解放后首批访问这个地区的外国记者身份，在《真理报》撰文，以大量的事实说明当时西藏的农奴制度是怎样的阴森残酷，农奴制下的西藏人民，哪里有起码的“人权”可言？奥夫钦尼科夫对中国的经济改革有深刻的研究和独到的见解。他不只一次地发表有关中国经济改革的文章，充分肯定中国经济在改革之路上所取得的成就，同时也指出产生的问题和弊端，希望自己的国家加以借鉴。
    “今天，中苏关系的基础比过去任何时候都更加巩固了，因为我们不再对抗，但也不再结盟”，奥夫钦尼科夫侃侃而谈。“‘结盟’一词本身就不符合今天的现实。在当今的世界上，战争正在让位给对话，紧张正让位给缓和。在这种形势下，结盟并非国家关系的最好形式。和平共处才是国与国关系的最好基础。然而对于中苏这两个社会主义大国来讲，和平共处不应仅仅意味着不要战争，还更应意味着加强合作和睦邻关系。”
    奥夫钦尼科夫认为，中苏两国都在进行改革，遇到的困难和问题也颇相似。扩大企业自主权和市场机制的形成给经济注入了极大的活力；然而同时也产生了本位主义、地方主义，而那些必不可少的便宜小商品无人愿意生产等一些反面现象。经济的多元化和价格的双轨制又给“官倒”的产生创造了条件。他笑着说：“我们的‘官倒’暂时尚未成灾，但通货膨胀却的的确确已经相当严重了。”
    “是的，我们有惊人的相似之处。但是我们又各有各的特点，各自在解决着自己的问题，各自走着自己的路。我们都比从前聪明了，明白了‘不仅不能输出革命，也不能输出改革模式’的道理。可这并不妨碍我们互相研究、借鉴对方的经验和教训，不是么？”他认真地问道。
    是的，当然是这样。但是我们究竟彼此应该学习些什么呢？对于我的这个问题，奥夫钦尼科夫沉思片刻后回答：“有人说，中国在经济改革方面成绩斐然，而我们则在政治改革方面迈的步子大一些。我很难判断这种说法是否正确，不过苏联委实应该学习中国进行经济改革的勇气，学习中国卓有成效的开放政策，学习中国硕果累累的建立经济特区的经验。我们高度评价中国发展合资企业的成就。如今中国已有１８０００家合资企业，而我们暂时还只有２００家，我们的人民目前还尚未感受到改革的实惠。如果中国同志研究我们的政治改革，应看到‘公开性’原则和民主化一方面极大地动员了社会各阶层的政治热情，另一方面也使得积累已久的各种社会问题不断爆发，例如族际主义问题……总之，任何一方研究对方的经验时，也要认真总结它的教训。教训也同样是十分有益的。”
    “例如，去年中国的抢购之风骤然刮起，通货膨胀打击了中国经济和老百姓的口袋之后不久，戈尔巴乔夫就在乌克兰的基辅市毅然宣布，最近两三年之内苏联不进行物价改革。看，这就是借鉴教训的明证！”我们都笑了。
    握手告别之际，奥夫钦尼科夫热情地对我说：“我们的报纸热切地期待着与《人民日报》建立联系。我本人期望着在中华人民共和国４０周年华诞之时再来造访你们古老而又年轻的国家”。
