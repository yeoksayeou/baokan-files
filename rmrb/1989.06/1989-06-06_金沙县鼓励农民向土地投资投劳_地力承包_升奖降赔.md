Jin Sha County Encourages Farmers to Invest in Land
Land Quality Contracting, Rewards for Improvement, Penalties for Decline

XINHUA, GUIYANG, June 6 - (Correspondents Wang Wei Yi and Li Xiao You) In Guizhou Province's Jin Sha County, the implementation of land quality contracting, rewards for improvement, and penalties for decline, along with compensation for basic farmland construction, has motivated farmers to invest in and work on their land.

Jin Sha County has addressed the issue of some farmers prioritizing short-term gains and neglecting land maintenance after the implementation of the household responsibility system, leading to a decline in soil fertility and reduced grain yields. In 1987, the county conducted trials and proposed a system of land quality contracting, rewards for improvement, penalties for decline, and compensation for basic farmland construction. This system was fully implemented in all 88 townships in 1988. The methods include:

Dividing land into grades based on fertility, soil depth, quality, irrigation conditions, and soil obstacles. Contracting land based on its estimated annual yield or value, and implementing a system of rewards for improvement and penalties for decline. Every three or five years, the results are settled, and if the yield exceeds the contracted amount for several consecutive years, each mu (a unit of area) can receive a land quality improvement reward of 2 to 4 yuan. If the contracted target is not met, each mu will be penalized with a land quality decline fee of 3 to 6 yuan. If a farmer receives the land quality improvement reward for three consecutive times, the upgraded land will be recorded in the "Land Contracting Certificate." For those who are penalized for land quality decline for three consecutive times, they must improve the contracted land within a specified period to meet the grade. If the improvement is not completed within the period, only the land for grain ration will be allocated, and the remaining land will be taken back and leased to others for operation. For compensation for basic farmland construction, the investment and labor of each household in converting dry land to paddy fields, terraced fields, expanding cultivated land, improving barren and infertile land, and adding irrigation facilities are compensated based on the amount of investment and labor. The compensation standards are divided into several periods: from 1980 to 1984, each workday is compensated with 0.50 yuan for meals; from 1985 to 1987, each workday is compensated with 1 yuan; from 1988 onwards, each workday is compensated with no more than 2 yuan. The depreciation of tools used is calculated at 8%, and consumable materials are evaluated by the masses and approved by the village economic organization.

These measures to improve land management have changed the situation where land fertility was neglected after the implementation of the household responsibility system. Statistics show that last year, 1,715 households in the county converted 1,740 mu of dry land to paddy fields, 589 households converted an average of 2.4 mu of slope land to terraced fields per household, and 970 households either personally or jointly built and repaired small ditches and hill reservoirs. At the same time, it promoted the development of non-arable land resources. Last year, farmers in the county contracted a total of over 300,000 mu of wasteland, grassland, and water surfaces, which were developed into citrus orchards, tea gardens, mulberry gardens, fish ponds, or used for afforestation, grass planting, and livestock raising on barren hills.

　　金沙县鼓励农民向土地投资投劳
    地力承包　升奖降赔
    新华社贵阳６月６日电  （通讯员王维义、李孝佑）贵州省金沙县在全县推广地力估价承包、升奖降赔和对农田基本建设进行补偿的办法，调动了农民向土地投资投劳的积极性。
    金沙县针对土地承包到户后，有些农民追求短期效益，种地不养地，造成地力下降，粮食减收的状况，１９８７年，这个县经过试点，提出了地力估价承包、升奖降赔和农田基本建设补偿制度，并于１９８８年在全县８８个乡（镇）实施。其作法是：将土地按肥力、活土层、质地、灌溉条件，土地障碍层等分等定级后，根据地力的年产量或年产值估价承包，实行升奖降赔，每３年或５年兑现一次，连续几年超产的，每亩可获得地力上升奖２至４元；如果达不到承包指标，则每亩赔地力下降费３至６元。连续３次获得地力上升奖的，升级的土地应填入《土地承包使用证》。对连续３次赔偿地力下降费的，要限期改造所承包的土地，使其达到等级。若超过期限未能达到，只划给口粮田，其余土地收回转租他人经营。对农田基本建设的补偿，是按包干到户以来各农户在责任地里改旱地为水田，坡土改梯土、扩大耕地、改造冷烂锈田、增添水利设施等情况，以其投资、投劳多少，实行“投工补助伙食费、投资补助折旧费”办法进行的。补助标准分几个时期，１９８０年至１９８４年间投劳，每个工日补助伙食费０．５０元，１９８５年至１９８７年间每工补助１元，１９８８年以后每工补助不超过２元。使用的工具按８％折旧费计算，消耗性材料由群众评议，村经济组织审核。
    这些健全土地管理制度的措施，改变了包干到户后土地肥力上升下降无人过问的状况。据统计，去年，全县有１７１５户农民改旱地为水田１７４０多亩，有５８９户平均每户改坡土为梯土２．４亩，有９７０户自己动手或联户兴修维修小型沟渠和山塘水库，同时还促进了对非耕地资源的开发。去年全县农户共承包荒山、草坡和水面等非耕地３０余万亩，被分别开发为柑桔园、茶园、桑园、鱼塘或从事荒山造林、荒山种草养畜等。
