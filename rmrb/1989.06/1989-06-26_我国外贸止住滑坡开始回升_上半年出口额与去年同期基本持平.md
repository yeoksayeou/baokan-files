China's foreign trade stops sliding and begins to recover

Exports for the first half of the year are basically the same as last year

Beijing, June 26 (Xinhua) - According to the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, China's foreign trade saw a significant decline in the first half of June. Through the joint efforts of cadres and workers, it began to recover in mid-June. From June 10 to 20, a total of $99.3 million was exported, averaging nearly $100 million per day, an increase of 2.4% over the same period last year. From January 1 to June 20 this year, the country's total exports reached $1.759 billion. According to the same statistical criteria, this is basically the same as the same period last year.

However, due to the domestic economy being in a period of tightening and adjustment, issues such as insufficient funds for foreign trade procurement, inadequate supply, and declining quality and contract performance of export goods have not been fundamentally resolved. The export situation remains severe, and the task of making up for the losses caused by the turmoil and riots is still quite arduous.

Yesterday afternoon, the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade held a meeting for department heads and above, requiring the entire system to focus on studying the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session and related documents, while also focusing on business operations. Special attention should be paid to improving the foreign trade environment and order, and making every effort to expand exports and ensure national foreign exchange earnings. At the same time, efforts should be made to solve the problems encountered by approved foreign-invested enterprises, using facts to show that investing in China is safe and profitable. Efforts should be made to strengthen clean governance, rectify corruption, and genuinely address some of the issues that society cares about.

### 我国外贸止住滑坡开始回升  上半年出口额与去年同期基本持平

　　我国外贸止住滑坡开始回升     
    上半年出口额与去年同期基本持平
    本报北京６月２６日讯  记者刘霄报道：据经贸部透露，我国外贸６月上旬降幅较大。通过广大干部职工的共同努力，６月中旬开始回升，６月１０日至２０日共完成出口额９．９３亿美元，平均每天近１亿美元，比去年同期增长２．４％。今年１月１日至６月２０日止，全国出口实绩达１７５．９亿美元，按相同统计口径计算，与去年同期基本持平。
    但是，由于国内经济处于紧缩和调整时期，外贸收购资金紧缺、货源不足以及出口商品质量和履约率下降等问题并没有从根本上得到解决，出口形势依然严峻，把动乱和暴乱的损失补回来，任务还相当艰巨。
    昨天下午，经贸部召开司局级以上大会，要求全系统一手抓好四中全会公报和有关文件的学习，一手抓好业务。特别要抓紧治理外贸环境和秩序，千方百计扩大出口，保证国家外汇收入。同时，努力解决已批准的外商投资企业遇到的问题，用事实说明在中国投资是安全的，有利可图的。下功夫抓好廉政建设，整治腐败现象，实实在在解决一些社会上关心的问题。
