The curtain rises on the development of Meizhou Bay
The first phase of the refinery construction is completed

	The Ministry of Railways' 17th Engineering Bureau's Fourth Division, which participated in the earthwork construction of the Meizhou Bay Refinery, a key project of the national "Seventh Five-Year Plan," overcame various difficulties in the construction process by relying on advanced technology and mechanical equipment. They completed the first phase of the earthwork for the refinery 52 days ahead of schedule. Thus, the curtain has been raised on the state's development and construction of Meizhou Bay.

	Meizhou Bay is located in the central part of Fujian's coastal region and overlooks the Taiwan Strait. The state has decided to invest 13.5 billion yuan to build Meizhou Bay City over 15 years. The refinery covers an area of 1.5 square kilometers and requires an investment of 1 billion yuan, making it the first project in the development and construction of Meizhou Bay.

	Upon completion, this refinery will have an annual processing capacity of 2.5 million tons of crude oil and will produce 2.3 million tons of petroleum products annually. This will be significant in changing the overall layout of China's refining industry and accelerating the construction of the Meizhou Bay project.

　　湄洲湾开发序幕拉开
    炼油厂首期工程完工
    本报讯  参加国家“七五”计划重点工程湄洲湾炼油厂土方施工的铁道部第１７工程局四处，依靠先进的技术和机械设备，克服了施工中遇到的各种困难，提前５２天时间完成了炼油厂第一期土方工程。至此，国家开发建设湄洲湾的序幕已经拉开。
    湄洲湾位于福建沿海中部，濒临台湾海峡。国家决定投资１３５个亿，用１５年时间建成湄洲湾市，其中炼油厂占地面积１．５平方公里，投资１０亿元，是开发建设湄洲湾的第一个工程。
    这座炼油厂建成后，将形成２５０万吨原油的年加工能力。年产２３０万吨石油产品。对于改变我国炼油工业总体布局，以及加快湄洲湾工程建设都具有重要作用。　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　（宋占波）
