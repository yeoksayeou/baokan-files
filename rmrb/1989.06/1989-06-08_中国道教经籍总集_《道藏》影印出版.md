The extensive collection of Chinese Daoist scriptures, the "Daozang," has been reprinted by the Shanghai Bookstore, with the first batch of 800 copies already sold out.

Daoism has a history of over 2,000 years in China. The compilation of Daoist books began during the Eastern Jin Dynasty. Currently, the only complete versions of the "Daozang" and its supplement, the "Xu Daozang," are those printed during the Ming Dynasty and preserved in Beijing and Shanghai.

The "Daozang" is not only a compilation of ancient Daoist classics, various commentaries, Daoist scriptures, talismans, rituals, and writings, but it also includes a wide range of ancient texts. It comprises 5,485 volumes in total, making it an important document for the study of Chinese Daoism, history, philosophy, literature, social customs, music, art, and scientific technology. This reprint uses the Beijing Baiyun Temple's edition as the base text. It has corrected missing characters, pages, duplicate pages, and misplaced pages by referring to the Shanghai Baiyun Temple's old collection preserved in the Shanghai Library. The reprinted "Daozang" consists of 36 volumes.
