The White House Has Changed Its Mind

    By Zhang Liang, Correspondent

    The head of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, William K. Reilly, recently announced that the United States agrees to hold an international conference specifically to discuss the issue of global warming. Just before this, the White House had opposed the idea on the grounds that the timing was "not yet ripe." It should be said that the White House has taken a welcome turn on this major issue concerning human survival.

    As early as March of this year, more than 20 countries proposed holding such an international conference to reach an international agreement to solve this problem. Recently, under the auspices of the United Nations, representatives from 30 countries gathered in Geneva to preliminarily discuss the threat that global warming poses to the world environment. For a period of time, the United States had consistently refused to respond to the initiative to hold an international conference, citing the reason that the economic costs required by the treaty to be signed at the conference were not yet clear. Until last week, the White House still instructed its representatives attending the Geneva meeting to adopt a cautious attitude toward holding an international conference until the scientific, economic, and other impacts of global warming and the costs of correcting this problem were fully understood. However, other major Western countries unanimously supported holding an international conference, which put the United States in a very isolated position.

    The United States' actions have been strongly criticized by many countries, especially environmental protection organizations and many members of Congress within the United States, accusing President Bush of breaking his promise made during the presidential election. Bush had then promised that the United States would take the lead in solving this problem. What made the White House even more embarrassed was that the director of the U.S. Space Research Institute revised his testimony. According to Hansen's original draft, he believed that pollution caused by human activities would lead to drastic changes in the Earth's temperature, such as significant temperature increases, droughts, severe storms, and other natural disasters. However, the revised testimony was not affirmative or had some degree of doubt about the above conclusions. The White House later admitted that the Office of Management and Budget had revised Dr. Hansen's testimony. This small incident, like pouring oil on the fire, further fueled people's dissatisfaction and criticism.

    It is not difficult to see that it was under the strong pressure of domestic and international public opinion that the White House had to change its mind. In addition, President Bush will host a "Global Forum on Global Warming" in Washington this October to prepare for the formal convening of an international conference.

    Global warming is a major threat to human survival, primarily due to the greenhouse effect. According to scientists' general predictions, by the mid-21st century, the global average temperature will rise by 4-9 degrees Fahrenheit. And the rise in temperature will accelerate the reduction of organic matter on Earth. Therefore, many governments, environmental organizations, and relevant scientists from various countries strongly advocate for holding an international conference and signing an agreement to jointly address this serious problem.

    Although the White House has taken a welcome turn, U.S. environmental organizations still criticize the Bush administration for moving too slowly and call on the government to support congressional bills to unilaterally reduce mineral fuel consumption. It is estimated that 1/4 of the greenhouse gases causing the global greenhouse effect come from the United States, as the United States consumes 1/4 of the world's fuel each year. Therefore, the United States has an obligation to play an active role in solving the serious problem of global warming that threatens human survival.

　　白宫转了个弯子
    本报记者  张亮
    美国环境保护局局长赖利最近宣布，美国同意召开一次专门讨论全球性气温变暖问题的国际会议。而就在此之前，白宫还以现在时机“尚不成熟”为由表示反对。应该说，白宫在这个事关人类生存的重大问题上转了个值得欢迎的弯子。
    早在今年３月，世界２０多个国家倡议召开这样一次国际会议，以达成一项解决这一问题的国际条约。最近，在联合国主持下，３０个国家的代表聚会日内瓦，初步探讨全球性气温变暖对世界环境的威胁程度。前一个时期，美国一直拒绝响应召开国际会议的倡议，其理由是现在尚不大清楚会议签订的条约所需要的经济成本会有多大。直到上个星期，白宫还指示其参加日内瓦会议的代表，在没有弄清全球性气温变暖所产生的科学、经济和其它影响以及纠正这一问题需要的费用之前，美国要对召开国际会议采取谨慎态度。但是，其它主要西方国家则一致赞成召开国际会议，这就使美国处于一种十分孤立的境地。
    美国的做法遭到许多国家特别是美国国内环境保护组织和许多国会议员的强烈批评，指责布什总统违背在总统竞选时许下的诺言。布什当时曾保证，美国在解决这一问题上要发挥带头作用。使白宫更为难堪的是，美国宇航局空间研究院院长修改了证词。根据汉森的原稿，他认为人类活动产生的污染所造成的全球性气温变暖会导致地球气温的剧烈变化，如气温大大升高、干旱、强烈风暴等其它自然灾害。而经过修改后的证词则对上述结论并未肯定或有某种程度的怀疑。白宫后来也承认行政管理和预算局曾修改过汉森博士的证词。这一小插曲犹如火上加油，更加激起了人们的不满和指责。
    不难看出，正是在国内外舆论的强大压力下，白宫不得不转了个弯子。此外，布什总统还将于今年１０月在华盛顿主持一次讨论全球性气温变暖的“全球专题讨论会”，为正式召开国际会议作准备。
    全球性气温变暖是对人类生存的一大威胁，其主要原因是由于温室效应的影响。据科学家们的普遍预测，到下个世纪中期，全球性平均气温将升高华氏４—９度。而气温升高会加速地球上有机物的减少。因此，许多国家政府、各国环保组织和有关科学家强烈呼吁召开国际会议并签署一项条约，共同决定这一严重问题。
    尽管白宫转了一个值得欢迎的弯子，但是美国的环保组织仍批评布什政府的步子太慢，并呼吁政府支持国会提出的议案，单方面减少矿物燃料。据估计，造成全世界温室效应的１／４废气出自美国，因为美国每年消耗的燃料占世界的１／４。因此，美国在解决全球性气温变暖这一威胁人类生存的严重问题上有着义不容辞的责任，理应发挥积极作用。
