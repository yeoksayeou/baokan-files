I am a procurement officer for the grain and oil procurement station recently established by my company. Due to my work, I have seen and heard things that make me feel that the current state of the grain market in our country urgently needs rectification.

Over the past year, many places in our country have seen various industries engaging in the buying and selling of grain. Companies, shops, and government agencies are all involved in this type of business. They use trucks, ships, and trains to speculate on grain, creating an unprecedented "grain procurement and sales war." Some grain is still in state warehouses but has already changed hands multiple times, with prices soaring higher and higher. Some control the supply, hoarding grain to wait for the right moment to sell at high prices, making the grain market chaotic. At the same time, a large amount of grain procurement loans have impacted the financial market.

I believe that the grain market should be controlled by the state at the macro level. Given the increasingly severe grain situation in our country, such a chaotic grain market can easily burden the public's psyche, which is not conducive to stability and unity. Therefore, the grain market has reached a point where it must be rectified.

### 粮食市场亟需整顿

　　粮食市场亟需整顿
    我是我公司新近设立的粮油采购站的采购员。由于工作关系，所见所闻使我感到我国粮食市场的现状亟需整顿。
    去年以来，我国一些地方不少行业都在从事粮食买卖，公司、商店、机关都在搞这种经营活动。他们动用汽车、轮船、火车倒卖粮食，形成了一场盛况空前的“粮食购销大战”。有的粮食还在国家的仓库里，却已几经倒手，几易其主，价格一涨再涨；有的垄断货源，囤积居奇，等待时机高价抛出，把好端端的粮食市场搞得十分混乱。同时，大量的购粮贷款，冲击了金融市场。
    我认为，粮食市场应由国家宏观控制。在我国粮食问题日趋严峻的形势下，如此混乱的粮食市场，容易给群众的心理造成负担，不利于安定团结，所以粮食市场已到了非整顿不可的时候了。
