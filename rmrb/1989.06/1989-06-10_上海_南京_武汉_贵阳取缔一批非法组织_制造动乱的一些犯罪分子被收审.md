Shanghai, Nanjing, Wuhan, Guiyang Dissolve Illegal Organizations
Criminals Who Incited Chaos Arrested

	Shanghai, June 10 (Xinhua) — The Shanghai Municipal Government yesterday took legal action to dissolve the illegal organization "Shanghai Workers' Autonomous Federation," which had been inciting disturbances and attempting to overthrow the government. The nine ringleaders of this illegal organization have been apprehended by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau.

	According to reports from the public, the Shanghai Public Security Bureau has preliminarily investigated that the "Shanghai Workers' Autonomous Federation," planned by Chen Shengfu, Wang Miaogen, Wang Hong, and others, frequently held secret meetings, spread rumors, distributed leaflets, incited strikes, and advocated "overthrowing the government." These individuals also often mingled with student crowds, shouting reactionary slogans, setting up barricades, and disrupting traffic and social order. Some of them even participated in the chaos at the Shanghai Guangxin Road railway crossing and secretly connected with Fudan University, Tongji University, and other institutions. It was found that some of these individuals had previously committed theft, hooliganism, and other illegal activities, as well as the illegal sale of tickets.

	Additionally, the Shanghai Public Security Department reported that another illegal organization, the "Patriotic Volunteer Army," which spread rumors and incited the overthrow of the government, has also been dissolved.

	Nanjing, June 10 (Xinhua) — Today, the Nanjing Public Security Bureau legally arrested more than ten ringleaders of the illegal organizations "Workers' Patrol Squad" and "Workers' Autonomous Federation."

	These two illegal organizations were established by some lawless elements in Nanjing since May. They collaborated with the illegal organization "Nanjing University Autonomous Federation" and organized several illegal marches and demonstrations, shouting reactionary slogans, distributing reactionary leaflets, spreading rumors, and misleading the public. Especially after the suppression of the counterrevolutionary riots in Beijing, their activities became more frequent, using methods such as blocking traffic, inciting strikes, class boycotts, and market closures to support the counterrevolutionary riots. On June 5, the Nanjing Municipal Government issued a "Notice" ordering these illegal organizations to immediately stop their activities and dissolve themselves. However, they not only did not stop their activities but became even more arrogant. A few bad elements even plotted to seize weapons, rob banks, expand their organizations, murder police officers, and go underground.

	It was found that some of the ringleaders of these illegal organizations were not workers at all, and some had criminal records in the past. The Standing Committee member of the illegal organization "Workers' Autonomous Federation," Zhu Huimin, is an unemployed resident of Nanjing who has been detained by the public security authorities multiple times in the past for assaulting others and engaging in hooliganism.

	Wuhan, June 10 (Xinhua) — (Reporter Fang Zhengjun, Correspondent Lu Yibing) The Wuhan Public Security Bureau reported that recently, the public security authorities have detained and investigated a group of 28 people known as the "Shirtless Marching Squad."

	It was reported that a few days ago, when the situation in Wuhan was chaotic due to some college students taking to the streets, a group of shirtless individuals wearing slippers appeared on the bustling Zhongshan Road in Hankou. These people carried a banner reading "Workers' Support Team" and shouted wildly, "We want to eat! We want to smoke!" They behaved disgracefully on the streets, forcibly demanding money and cigarettes from passersby. According to a young worker who reported to the public security station with his shirt off and his pants held up, several shirtless squad members stopped him and shouted, "Quickly take off your clothes and join our team, and you'll have food and drink!" This young worker refused, and immediately, the gangsters forcibly removed his shirt and took the belt from his pants.

	After receiving the report, the officers of the Public Security Patrol Team of Wuhan Public Security Bureau immediately rushed to Zhongshan Road and surrounded the group of "shirtless squad members" at the intersection of Lanling Road; 28 "shirtless squad members" were arrested. Preliminary investigation revealed that these individuals were mostly idle and unemployed people and young workers with bad records.

	Guiyang, June 10 (Xinhua) — Early this morning, the Guiyang Public Security Bureau smashed an illegal activity by lawless elements who intercepted vehicles, set up barricades, blocked traffic, and disrupted social order. Twenty-five ringleaders were administratively detained or detained for investigation.

	Last night around 8:00 PM, this group of lawless elements gathered hundreds of people at the People's Square in Guiyang to incite and provoke, announcing a so-called "action plan" to incite some people to block vehicles at key traffic points, set up barricades, and claim to disrupt Guiyang City. At 10:25 PM, this group, carrying banners with slogans such as "For democracy, for freedom," set off from the People's Square, passing through major streets such as the Guiyang Post and Telecommunications Building, and finally gathered at the traffic bottlenecks near the Guiyang Bus Station and Touqiao. They first stopped two large trucks, forcing the drivers to place the vehicles in the middle of the road, forcibly removing the high-voltage circuits of the vehicles, seizing the keys, and letting the air out of the tires. They then blocked 16 more large trucks, forming layer upon layer of barricades, causing severe traffic congestion for nearly an hour.

	Upon investigation, it was found that among these lawless elements, some were released from reform through labor, some were recently released from re-education through labor, and some were individuals who had been expelled from their work units and repeatedly caused trouble in society.

　　上海　南京　武汉　贵阳取缔一批非法组织
    制造动乱的一些犯罪分子被收审
    新华社上海６月１０日电  上海市人民政府昨天依法取缔煽动闹事、妄图搞乱上海、推翻政府的非法组织“上海工人自治联合会”，这个非法组织的９名头头已被上海公安机关抓获。
    根据人民群众举报，上海市公安机关初步查实，由陈盛福、王妙根、王虹等人策划成立的“上海工自联”，经常秘密聚会，传播谣言，散发传单，煽动罢工，鼓吹“打倒政府”。这些人还多次混在学生队伍中呼喊反动口号，设置路障，破坏交通和社会秩序。有的人还窜到上海光新路铁路道口参与骚乱活动，出入复旦、同济等大学进行秘密串连。据查，他们中的有些人过去曾犯有盗窃罪以及流氓、贩卖票证等违法活动。
    另据上海公安部门介绍，一个散布谣言煽动推翻政府的非法组织“爱国义勇军”日前也被取缔。
    据新华社南京６月１０日电　南京市公安机关今天依法逮捕了非法组织“工人纠察队”、“工人自治联合会”为首作案的１０多名歹徒。
    这两个非法组织是今年５月以来南京市一些不法分子先后成立的。他们同设在南京大学的非法组织“南京高校自治联合会”串联，多次组织参加非法游行示威，呼喊反动口号，散发反动传单，造谣惑众，蛊惑人心。特别是在北京平息反革命暴乱以后，他们的活动更加频繁，以阻塞交通、煽动罢工、罢课、罢市等手段支持反革命暴乱。南京市人民政府６月５日发出《通告》，责令这些非法组织立即停止活动，自行解散。但是，他们不仅没有停止活动，反而气焰更加嚣张。少数坏人还密谋策划夺取枪支、抢劫银行，发展组织，杀害民警，转入地下等犯罪活动。
    据查，这些非法组织的头头有的根本不是什么工人，一些人历史上还有违法犯罪前科。非法组织“工自联”常委朱惠明是南京市一个无业居民，过去曾因殴打他人和耍流氓，多次被公安机关拘留过。
    据新华社武汉６月１０日电　（记者方政军、通讯员鲁艺兵）武汉市公安局提供的消息说，近日公安机关收容审查了一支２８人组成的“赤膊游行队”。
    据介绍，前几天当武汉地区由于部分高校学生上街游行集会、秩序比较混乱之时，在武汉市汉口繁华的中山大道上，出现了一支由三四十名袒胸露背、脚穿拖鞋的“赤膊游行队”。这些人扯出“工人声援团”的横幅，一路狂呼乱喊：“我们要吃饭！我们要抽烟！”他们在马路上丑态百出，强行向过往行人要钱、要烟。据一名光着上身，提着裤子来到公安派出所报案的青年工人揭发：几个赤膊队员拦住他喊道：“快把衣服脱掉，参加我们的队伍，保你有吃喝！”这名青年工人不从，立刻被这伙歹徒强行脱光其上衣，并抽走了他裤子上的皮带。
    武汉市公安局治安巡逻大队接到报告后，干警们兵分两路，马上赶到中山大道将这伙“赤膊队”合围在兰陵路口；共抓获２８名“赤膊队员”。据初步审查，这些人均是社会无业闲散人员和有劣迹的青年工人。
    据新华社贵阳６月１０日电　今日凌晨，贵阳市公安机关粉碎了一起不法分子拦截汽车，设置路障，堵塞交通，扰乱社会治安的违法活动，２５名为首者分别被依法行政拘留或收容审查。
    昨天晚上２０时许，这伙不法分子纠集数百人聚集在贵阳市人民广场进行挑唆煽动，宣布了所谓的“行动方案”，煽动一些人到交通要道拦截车辆，设置路障，扬言要把贵阳市搞乱。２２时２５分，这伙人打着“为民主而来，为自由而战”的横幅标语，从人民广场出发，经贵阳市邮电大楼等主要街道，最后聚集在贵阳汽车站和头桥一带的交通咽喉地带。他们先将过往的两辆大货车拦住，威逼驾驶员把车横放在路中央，强行撤掉汽车高压电路，抢走钥匙，放掉车胎的气，接着又堵截了１６辆大货车，形成层层路障，造成交通严重堵塞近一小时。
    经审查，这伙不法分子中，有的是劳改释放分子，有的是刚解除劳教的人员，还有的是被工作单位开除后多次在社会上寻衅闹事的流窜犯罪分子。
