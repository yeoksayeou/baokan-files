According to a report by *China Business News*, Hu Ping, the Minister of Commerce, recently stated that to build a clean government, both ideological education and the establishment of relevant systems are necessary. Corrupt practices must not be allowed to infiltrate award evaluations and product certifications.

At a meeting held by the Ministry of Commerce, Hu Ping analyzed the current situation of integrity construction in the commercial sector. He pointed out that while some award evaluations and new product certifications are beneficial, some have been tainted by corrupt practices, turning into instances of buying gold medals with money. This is a form of deceit and immoral behavior that is even more harmful than extravagant banquets and feasts. We must resolutely oppose this trend and advocate for truthfulness and hard work. Hu Ping emphasized that in the future, the purchase of imported cars without approval will not be permitted, and meetings should not be held at tourist spots during peak travel seasons. Necessary banquets should be conducted in accordance with state regulations.

Hu Ping stressed that the integrity construction of the Ministry of Commerce should start from its own actual situation. In terms of transforming functions, integrity is directly related to business operations and commercial reforms. A large number of commodities flow through our work to the entire country, and if the Ministry of Commerce is not clean, it will inevitably bring disorder to the circulation sector. He pointed out that what we ask others to do, we must first do ourselves. If leaders violate regulations, investigations must be conducted and appropriate actions must be taken.

　　胡平谈商业部门廉政建设
    评奖创优不能染上腐败风
    本报讯  据《中国商报》报道：商业部长胡平日前说，搞好廉政建设既要进行思想教育，也要建立有关制度，决不能把腐败作风带进评奖创优和产品鉴定活动中。
    在商业部召开的一次会上，胡平分析了商业系统廉政建设的情况，他指出，目前社会上搞的一些评奖创优和新产品鉴定活动，本来是好事，但是有的把腐败作风带进去，变成用金钱买金牌，这是一种弄虚作假、欺骗百姓的不道德行为，比宴请吃喝的影响还要坏。我们必须坚决地反对这种倾向，提倡实事求是，提倡艰苦奋斗。胡平指出，今后，未经批准不准购买进口车，在旅游旺季不要到旅游点开会；必要的宴请要按国家规定执行。
    胡平强调，商业部机关的廉政建设要从自身的实际情况出发。从转变职能上看，廉政同业务工作、同商业改革都有直接关系。大量的商品是通过我们的工作流向全国的，如果部机关不廉洁，就必然会给流通领域带来混乱。他指出，要让下面做到的，我们自己首先要做到。领导干部如果违反规定，该查的一定要查，该处理的一定要处理。
