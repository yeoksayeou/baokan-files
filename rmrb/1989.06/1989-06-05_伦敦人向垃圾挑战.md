Recently, the reporter visited the British Department of the Environment and the London Waste Management Agency, and toured the Edmonton Solid Waste Incineration Plant. London's success in garbage disposal left a deep impression on me.

"Reduce Pollution, Produce and Clear Daily"
As the fifth-largest economy in the West, Britain has seen a rapid increase in solid waste (including domestic, construction, and industrial waste) due to the development of industrial production, the expansion of construction, and the improvement of living standards. According to the Department of the Environment, the total amount of solid waste in Britain has reached 100 million tons per year, with 30 million tons being domestic waste.

Facing the threat of increasing garbage, the British government and relevant departments in London have taken active measures to ensure that garbage is "produced and cleared daily," reducing the pollution caused by garbage. Mr. Burns, an official in charge of waste management at the Department of the Environment, told the reporter that the British government has always attached great importance to environmental protection. By formulating a series of policies and regulations, it guides and supervises waste management. For example, just last year, two regulations were issued: "Rules for the Collection and Disposal of Garbage" and "Rules for the Packaging of Hazardous Waste." At the same time, the government also provides technical guidance for waste management as much as possible.

Landfill Method Saves Money, Incineration Method is Thorough
Currently, the main methods of garbage disposal in the London area are landfill and incineration. Each method has its advantages and disadvantages.

The landfill method is economical and convenient. It is calculated that the cost of treating garbage with this method is only 7 pounds per ton. Currently, 87% of the garbage treated in Britain is handled using this method. However, the drawback of this method is that it requires a large amount of land, and the methane gas produced by the buried garbage can move around and has caused explosions in the past. Improving landfill standards and controlling the production of methane gas is also costly.

The incineration method utilizes high temperatures to incinerate garbage, making it harmless, with the residue being small in volume and light in weight, making the final disposal relatively simple. It can also generate electricity and heat. Currently, incineration handles 8% of the solid waste in Britain. London has four garbage treatment plants. The Edmonton Waste Incineration Plant in North London, which the reporter visited, is the largest plant in Europe for recovering heat and electricity from waste. The general manager of the plant, Mr. Martin Jones, told the reporter that the plant incinerates 400,000 tons of garbage annually, recovering heat to generate electricity worth over 4 million pounds, and plans to supply heat to London in the future. However, the drawback of the incineration method is that it is expensive, with the cost of treating each ton of garbage being three times that of the landfill method.

Classification and Recycling, Reuse
"Classification and recycling of waste, and reuse seem to be a viable option," said Mr. Cooper, a responsible person at the London Waste Management Agency, who has written extensively on waste management.

London has done a lot of work in waste classification and recycling, and waste reuse. London currently has 26 "recycling centers" for waste. Some areas in East London have set up classified garbage bins for recycling old newspapers, used clothes, glass bottles, tin cans, etc. Last year, London recycled 40,000 tons of old newspapers and 300,000 tons of concrete. By the end of this year, half of London will implement separate recycling of paper waste.

The British government has also worked hard to strengthen public environmental awareness. Some promotional booklets and publications prominently state: "Save our resources," "80% of household waste can be reused," "Garbage is money! Recycle it! Reuse it! Recycle it!" This is London's response to the increasing challenge of garbage.

### 伦敦人向垃圾挑战

　　伦敦人向垃圾挑战
    本报记者  陈特安
    不久前，记者走访了英国环境部和伦敦垃圾管理局，参观了埃德蒙顿固体垃圾焚烧厂。伦敦在垃圾处理上的成功给我留下深刻的印象。
    “力减污染　日产日清”英国作为西方第五经济大国，随着工业生产的发展、建设规模的扩大、居民消费水平的提高，城乡固体废弃物（包括生活垃圾、建筑垃圾和工业垃圾）也急剧增加。据环境部统计，全英国的固体垃圾已增至一年１亿吨的天文数字，其中生活垃圾３０００万吨。
    面对垃圾不断增加的威胁，英国政府及伦敦有关部门积极采取措施，做到垃圾“日产日清”，力减垃圾对环境造成的污染。环境部主管垃圾处理的官员伯恩先生告诉记者，英国政府一直非常重视环境保护，通过制定一系列的政策法规，来对垃圾处理进行引导和督促。比如，仅在去年，就制定了《垃圾的收集和处理规则》和《危险垃圾的装配规则》等两项法规。同时，政府还尽量为垃圾处理提供技术指导。
    填埋法省钱　焚烧法彻底　目前，伦敦地区使用的垃圾处理法主要是填埋法和焚烧法。这两种方法各有千秋。
    填埋法的特点是经济而简便。据计算，用这种方法处理垃圾，每吨垃圾处理费用仅７英镑。目前，英国用这种方法处理的垃圾占全部被处理垃圾的８７％。但这种方法的弱点是，占地大，埋于地下的垃圾产生的沼气到处移动，曾引起过爆炸，而要改进填埋标准和控制沼气的产生，代价又较昂贵。
    焚烧法的特点是利用高温焚化垃圾，无害化彻底，其残渣体积小、重量轻，最终处理较为简单，同时又能产生电能和热能。焚烧法目前担负着全英国固体垃圾的８％的处理任务。伦敦地区现有４座垃圾处理工厂。记者参观的伦敦北郊埃德蒙顿垃圾焚烧厂是欧洲从垃圾回收热能和电能的最大的工厂。该厂总经理马丁·琼斯先生告诉记者，该厂每年焚化４０万吨垃圾，回收热能发电价值４００多万英镑，今后还准备向伦敦供热。但焚烧法的弱点是费用昂贵，每吨的处理费用是填埋法的３倍。
    分类回收　循环利用　“看来，废弃物分类回收、循环利用正在被证明是一种可行的选择”，对垃圾处理有不少著述的伦敦垃圾管理局负责人库伯先生对记者说。
    伦敦在垃圾分类回收，垃圾再利用方面还做了大量的工作。伦敦目前已有２６个废弃物“再循环中心”，伦敦东部的一些地区已设置分类垃圾筒，分类回收废报纸、破旧衣服、玻璃瓶、铁皮罐等。去年，伦敦就回收４万吨旧报纸和３００万吨混凝土。到今年年底，伦敦将有一半地区实行废纸分开回收。
    英国政府在加强公众的环境意识方面也下了苦功，一些宣传小册子和出版物上面醒目地写着：“节约我们的资源”，“８０％的家庭垃圾可以再利用”，“垃圾就是英镑！回收它！再利用它！再循环它”！这就是伦敦人对垃圾日增挑战的回答。
