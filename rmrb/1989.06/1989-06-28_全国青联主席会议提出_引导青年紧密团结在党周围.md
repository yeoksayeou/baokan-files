The National Youth Federation held a chairman's meeting on June 26 to seriously study the important speeches by Comrade Deng Xiaoping recently, as well as the communiqué and related documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Party. They expressed their full support for all the resolutions made by the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee and their full support and confidence in the new central leadership headed by Comrade Jiang Zemin.

The meeting was presided over by Liu Yandong, Chairman of the National Youth Federation. During the discussion, the comrades highly praised the important judgment proposed by the meeting that "the four cardinal principles are the foundation of the country, and reform and opening up are the path to national strength." They unanimously agreed that the experience since the founding of New China has shown that only by adhering to the four cardinal principles can we ensure that the socialist modernization of our country has a correct direction and the possibility of success; only by taking the path of reform and opening up can China's development and various construction undertakings have hope. The National Youth Federation should mobilize and guide the youth of all ethnic groups and sectors across the country to closely unite around the Party, to firmly and consistently adhere to the four cardinal principles, and to steadfastly and consistently implement the policy of reform and opening up.

The attendees fully agreed with and firmly supported the four key tasks proposed by the Party Central Committee. Everyone believed that these four major tasks are in line with the hearts of the Party and the people, in line with the interests and wishes of the vast majority of young people, and embody the Party Central Committee's strategic vision and high sense of responsibility for the country and the nation. The meeting required that all levels of Youth Federation organizations and Youth Federation members actively respond to the call of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, adhere to the four cardinal principles, adhere to reform and opening up, carry forward the spirit of patriotism, unity, hard work, and entrepreneurship, and vigorously promote the in-depth development of socialist, patriotic, hard work, and legal discipline education. To further stabilize the situation, achieve the tasks of rectification and comprehensive deepening of reform, to promote the construction of democracy and the rule of law, to build socialism with Chinese characteristics, to play a greater role, and to make new contributions.
