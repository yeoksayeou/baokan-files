Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 9th.

The Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army have received letters from the Navy, Air Force, National Defense Science and Technology Commission, and National Defense University Party Committees expressing their support for the Central Committee's decision to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital.

The Navy

To the Central Military Commission and the General Political Department:

After the publication of the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council on June 5, the Standing Committee of the Navy Party Committee organized a thorough study and discussion. They unanimously expressed their firm support for the major decision and resolute measures taken by the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Everyone agreed that the serious counter-revolutionary rebellion that occurred in the capital was deliberately instigated by a small number of people, aiming to oppose the leadership of the Communist Party of China, attempting to overthrow the socialist system, and overthrow the People's Republic of China. At this critical moment concerning the fate of the Party and the country, the troops executing the martial law have firmly executed the Central Committee's decision, achieving an initial victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, defending the Four Cardinal Principles, defending the People's Republic of China won by tens of millions of martyrs with their lives, and defending the fundamental interests of the Party and the people. The Navy Party Committee and all officers and soldiers of the Navy will firmly respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, maintain a firm stance, hold high the banner, and contribute to the complete suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

In accordance with the spirit and requirements of the Central Committee's decision, we have issued a notice to the troops, requiring them to seriously study the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, and the editorial in the People's Liberation Army Daily on June 4, to maintain political and action consistency with the Party Central Committee. We demand that the direct organs and units in Beijing do everything possible to provide food, accommodation, vehicles, medical care, and other material support for the martial law troops to suppress the rebellion.

To further implement the Central Committee's decision, we have made the following deployments for the troops: First, unify the troops' thoughts with the Central Committee's decision, educate the officers and soldiers to fully understand the truth and essence of the counter-revolutionary rebellion; recognize the severity of the situation and the long-term, arduous, and complex nature of the struggle; recognize that whether this rebellion can be suppressed is related to the survival of the People's Republic of China, the survival of the Party, and the survival of the nation. Second, give full play to the leading and combat roles of party organizations at all levels, educate party members to recognize the seriousness of this struggle, distinguish right from wrong, stand firm, and actively participate in the struggle to stop the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and be tested in the struggle. Third, strengthen publicity and propaganda, use various channels and means to propagate the Central Committee's spirit, propagate the facts, expose various rumors, and create a strong public opinion offensive against the rebellion in the Navy. Fourth, ensure the safety and smooth command of command organs at all levels, and resolutely stop the sabotage and disruption by the rioters.

The Air Force

To the General Political Department of the Air Force:

On June 4 and 5, the Standing Committee of the Air Force Party Committee and the broad cadres and soldiers of the entire army repeatedly and seriously studied the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, the important speeches by the Central Committee leaders, and the editorial in the People's Liberation Army Daily on June 4. They firmly support the Party Central Committee's decision to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion and resolutely complete the various tasks assigned by the Central Military Commission to the Air Force.

Through the study, the Air Force Party Committee and the broad cadres and soldiers expressed great indignation towards the counter-revolutionary elements who plotted, organized, and instigated this rebellion, and towards the thugs who carried out various violent acts such as beating, smashing, looting, burning, and killing. They expressed high respect and greetings to the cadres and soldiers of the martial law troops who made significant contributions to defending the Party Central Committee, defending our People's Republic of China, and defending the capital. The broad cadres and soldiers of the Air Force firmly believe that the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission have the ability and confidence to suppress this rebellion, stabilize the situation in the capital and the country, and consolidate the situation of unity and stability.

The Air Force Party Committee believes that this shocking counter-revolutionary rebellion is unprecedented since the founding of the country, is the result of the malicious development of turmoil instigated by a small number of people over a period of time, and is the consequence of the long-term spread of bourgeois liberalization. Its purpose is to attempt to overthrow the Party's leadership, deny the socialist system, and overthrow the People's Republic of China. Suppressing this rebellion fully reflects the strong wishes of the broad cadres and soldiers of the Air Force. At this critical moment when the fate of the Party and the country is at stake, we are determined to closely unite around the Party Central Committee, maintain a firm stance, hold high the banner, oppose the rebellion, and resolutely fight with the entire Party, the entire army, and the people of the whole country to complete the various tasks assigned by the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission to the Air Force. We must resolutely fight against those reactionary elements who have deep hatred for the Party and the socialist system, defend the fruits of revolution, construction, and reform.

The Air Force Party Committee expresses that it will organize the troops to deeply study the spirit of the instructions by the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, further unify the thoughts and actions of the cadres and soldiers, consciously maintain high consistency with the Party Central Committee in ideology and politics, strengthen the management of the troops, strengthen ideological and political work, strictly observe organizational discipline, perform duties conscientiously, carry out combat readiness training, and make due contributions to suppressing the rebellion and stabilizing the situation.

The National Defense Science and Technology Commission

To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission:

In recent days, the broad cadres and soldiers of the National Defense Science and Technology Commission have seriously studied the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, as well as the series of instructions from the Central Committee and the three general departments. They have listened to and watched the relevant announcements and news reports, expressing great indignation towards this shocking counter-revolutionary rebellion instigated by a small number of people, and firmly supporting the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission in taking resolute measures to suppress this rebellion.

This counter-revolutionary rebellion was premeditated by a small number of people and is the result of the escalation of large-scale turmoil. They openly raised the banner of "taking up arms and overthrowing the government," attempting to use violence to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party, deny the socialist system, and overthrow the People's Republic of China. The broad cadres and soldiers have witnessed the various violent acts of a small number of rioters, such as beating, smashing, looting, burning, and killing. Their methods are vile, and the situation is cruel, shocking people. We strongly condemn the counter-revolutionary rebellion and fascist atrocities instigated by a small number of people! We firmly believe that the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission have the resolve and confidence to command the martial law troops, armed police, public security personnel, and the people of the capital to thoroughly crush this counter-revolutionary rebellion. We strongly demand that the counter-revolutionary rioters and their behind-the-scenes planners and commanders be severely punished. If we are lenient, it will have endless consequences.

The National Defense Science and Technology Commission is responsible for the modernization construction of socialist China. We, the broad scientific and technological workers, engineering and technical personnel, workers, cadres, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, are determined to closely unite around the Party Central Committee, obey orders, follow commands, and for the suppression of the rebellion, maintain normal order in scientific research, production, testing, and teaching, and make new contributions to accelerating the modernization of our military equipment!

The National Defense University

To the General Political Department of the National Defense University:

The Party Committee and all comrades of the National Defense University have seriously studied the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council and unanimously expressed their firm support for the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission in taking resolute measures to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

The Party Committee of the National Defense University believes that since June 3, the turmoil instigated by a small number of people has developed into a shocking counter-revolutionary rebellion. Their purpose is to overthrow the Party's leadership, deny the socialist system, and overthrow the People's Republic of China. If resolute measures are not taken to suppress this rebellion, the People's Republic of China won by tens of millions of martyrs with their lives may be overthrown, the achievements of socialist construction and ten years of reform may be destroyed, and the country may be shrouded in a white terror. Suppressing this rebellion is a just action and fully reflects the wishes and fundamental interests of the people of the capital and the country. At this critical moment of national crisis, the Party Committee of the National Defense University requires all faculty, staff, and students to fully recognize the extreme seriousness of this struggle, unify their thoughts and actions with the spirit of the Party Central Committee, maintain a firm stance, follow commands, and resolutely carry out the wise decision of the Party Central Committee and the Central Military Commission to the end, and defend the fruits of revolution, construction, and reform.

    　　　　海军中央军委、总政治部：
    ６月５日，中共中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》发表以后，海军党委常委认真组织学习讨论。一致表示，坚决拥护党中央、国务院、中央军委为平息反革命暴乱作出的重大决策和采取的果断措施。大家一致认为，这次发生在首都的严重的反革命暴乱，是极少数人蓄意制造的，是他们反对中国共产党的领导，妄图推翻社会主义制度，颠覆人民共和国的集中暴露。在关系到党和国家命运前途的严峻时刻，执行戒严任务的部队，坚决执行中央决策，取得了平息反革命暴乱的初步胜利，捍卫了四项基本原则，捍卫了几千万先烈用生命换来的人民共和国，捍卫了党和人民的根本利益。海军党委和海军部队的共产党员及全体官兵，坚决响应党中央、国务院的号召，立场坚定，旗帜鲜明，为彻底平息反革命暴乱作出贡献。
    根据中央的决策精神和要求，我们向部队发出通知，要求认真学习中共中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》、解放军报６月４日社论，在政治上、行动上坚定地与党中央保持一致，要求海直机关和驻京单位尽一切可能为戒严部队平息暴乱提供食宿、车辆、医疗等物质方面的保障。
    为进一步贯彻落实好中央决策，我们向部队作了如下部署：一，用中央决策统一部队思想，教育干部战士充分认清反革命暴乱的真相和实质；认清形势的严峻和斗争的长期性、艰巨性、复杂性；认清这场暴乱能否平息，关系到人民共和国的存亡、党的存亡、民族的存亡。二，发挥各级党组织在斗争中的核心领导作用和战斗堡垒作用，教育党员认清这场斗争的严肃性，明辨是非，站稳立场，积极投入制止反革命暴乱的斗争，在斗争中经受考验。三，加强舆论宣传，通过多种渠道，运用多种手段，宣传中央精神，宣传事实真相，揭穿各种谣言，在海军形成反对和制止暴乱的强大舆论攻势。四，确保各级指挥机关的安全和顺利实施指挥，坚决制止暴徒的冲击袭扰和破坏。

    　　　　空军总政治部：
    ６月４日和５日，空军党委常委和全军部队广大干部战士，反复认真地学习了中共中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》、中央领导同志的重要讲话以及６月４日解放军报社论，坚决拥护党中央关于镇压反革命暴乱的决策，坚决完成中央军委赋予空军的各项任务。
    通过学习，空军党委和广大指战员对策划、组织、制造这场暴乱的反革命分子，对疯狂进行打、砸、抢、烧、杀等种种暴行的歹徒，表示极大的愤慨，对为保卫党中央、保卫我们的人民共和国、保卫首都作出重大贡献的戒严部队的指战员，表示崇高的敬意和问候。空军广大干部战士坚信，党中央、国务院、中央军委有能力、有把握平息这场暴乱，稳定首都和全国的局势，巩固安定团结的局面。
    空军党委认为，这场骇人听闻的反革命暴乱，是建国以来从未有过的，是一个时期以来极少数人蓄意制造动乱的恶性发展，是资产阶级自由化思潮长期泛滥的恶果，其目的就是妄图推翻党的领导，否定社会主义制度，颠覆中华人民共和国。平息这场暴乱完全符合全国人民的根本利益，充分反映了空军广大指战员的强烈愿望。在党和国家前途命运危急的关头，我们决心紧密地团结在党中央周围，立场坚定、旗帜鲜明地反对暴乱，坚决与全党、全军、全国人民一道，完成党中央、国务院、中央军委赋予空军的各项任务。要坚决同那些对党和社会主义制度有刻骨仇恨的反动分子进行斗争，保卫革命、建设和改革的成果。

    这场反革命暴乱是极少人蓄谋已久的，是大规模动乱愈演愈烈的结果。他们公开打出“拿起武器、推翻政府”的旗帜，妄图用暴力推翻共产党领导，否定社会主义制度，颠覆中华人民共和国。广大指战员目睹了一小撮暴徒打、砸、抢、烧、杀的种种暴行，其手段之恶劣，景况之残忍，令人发指。我们强烈声讨极少数人制造的这场反革命暴乱和法西斯暴行！我们坚信党中央、中央军委有决心有把握指挥戒严部队、武警部队、公安干警和首都人民一起彻底粉碎这场反革命暴乱。并强烈要求对反革命暴徒及其幕后策划指挥者进行严惩，决不能再手软了，否则，将后患无穷。
    国防科工委担负着祖国社会主义现代化建设的重任。我们广大科技工作者、工程技术人员、工人、干部、解放军指战员，决心紧密团结在党中央周围，服从命令，听从指挥，为平息暴乱，坚持正常科研、生产、试验、教学工作秩序，为加速我军武器装备现代化建设做出新的贡献！

    国防大学党委和全体同志认真学习中共中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》一致表示，坚决拥护党中央、国务院、中央军委采取果断措施镇压反革命暴乱。
    国防大学党委认为，从６月３日凌晨起，极少数人制造的动乱已经发展成为一场骇人听闻的反革命暴乱。他们的目的就是要推翻党的领导，否定社会主义制度，颠覆中华人民共和国。如不采取果断措施平息这场暴乱，几千万先烈用生命换来的人民共和国就可能被颠覆，社会主义建设和十年改革的成果就可能毁于一旦，全国就可能笼罩在一片白色恐怖之中。果断地平息这场暴乱，完全是正义的行动，是符合首都人民和全国人民的愿望和根本利益的。在国难当头的危急时刻，国防大学党委要求全校教职员工和全体学员，要充分认识这场斗争的极端严重性，用党中央的精神统一思想和行动，立场坚定，听从指挥，坚定不移的贯彻执行党中央、中央军委的英明决策，坚决把平息暴乱的斗争进行到底，保卫革命、建设和改革的成果。
