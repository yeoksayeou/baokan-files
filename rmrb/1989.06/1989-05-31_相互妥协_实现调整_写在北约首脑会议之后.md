Title: Mutual Compromise Achieves Adjustment

The summit held to celebrate the 40th anniversary of NATO's founding concluded on May 30th in a relaxed atmosphere.

The conference's development can be described as a "three-act play." The first act was "crisis looming," with pessimistic views spreading that there was little hope of reaching a consensus. Even some of the more optimistic observers began to speak cautiously. The second act was "a turning point." Bush's new arms reduction proposal was introduced, raising hopes. Although the working meeting on the afternoon of May 29th did not yield results, the gloomy atmosphere began to dissipate. From the night of May 29th to 30th, the foreign ministers of 16 countries engaged in "intense debate throughout the night." The final act was "reaching a compromise." At noon on May 30th, the leaders issued a conference declaration and a "comprehensive concept." As the curtain fell, everyone was pleased.

The French version of the declaration is 9 pages long, the English version is 10 pages, totaling 37 articles, making it "the longest declaration since NATO's founding." It elaborates in detail on the political strategy of the Atlantic Alliance. The "comprehensive concept" is even longer, with the French version being 16 pages and the English version 17 pages, totaling 65 articles. It is about NATO's arms reduction strategy, starting to be drafted in June 1987, and has been nearly two years in the making. Both documents aim to build on the past and look to the future, outlining a framework for NATO's future strategy, tasks, and role. From now on, NATO can proceed along the adjustment direction designed by these two documents, although the steps will be heavy and difficult, but at least there is a path to follow. That is to say, it will continuously develop full-scale cooperation with the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, influence the reforms in Eastern Europe, gradually reduce the conventional and nuclear forces deployed across Europe through arms reduction talks to "the minimum level," slowly break away from the post-war confrontation pattern, and establish a "peaceful new political order" from the Atlantic in the west to the Ural Mountains in the east.

The decisive factor in the birth of these two documents is that the leaders of NATO member countries, especially U.S. President Bush and West German Chancellor Kohl, made concessions on the short-range missile issue. First, on modernization, the two countries have been at odds in recent months, with the U.S. insisting on modernization and West Germany firmly opposing it. The "comprehensive concept" postpones the decision on modernization until after 1992, which is a concession by the U.S. The agreement that the research and development of short-range missile updates will be handled by the U.S. is an indication that the West German countries have made a concession to the U.S. because the so-called modernization is currently only a research and development issue. Secondly, on the negotiation issue, the U.S. originally firmly refused to negotiate with the Soviet Union on the short-range missile issue, while West Germany and other countries insisted on "starting talks as soon as possible." At this summit, all parties finally agreed to negotiations, but with several conditions: first, the short-range missile talks must be linked to the conventional weapons talks, and the latter must take precedence over the former. Only after the conventional weapons talks reach an agreement and begin implementation can the short-range missile talks start. Second, the Soviet Union must reduce its short-range missiles to the same number as NATO's, i.e., only 88. Third, if the short-range missile talks reach an agreement, it can only be implemented after the conventional weapons talks agreement is fully executed. From this, it can be seen that the U.S. has abandoned its "no talks" stance, and West Germany and other countries have abandoned their "as soon as possible" stance, with the latter's concession seeming to be greater. Finally, on the "third zero option," West Germany originally held a supportive attitude. The two documents of this summit avoid discussing this issue. But the meaning is very clear, that is, it emphasizes the short-range missile talks, which only involve "partial reduction of short-range nuclear weapons," and actually negates the "third zero option." It seems that West Germany and other countries, considering the firm stance of the U.S., the UK, and France, did not fully insist on their own views.

In summary, this summit, due to concessions from all parties, achieved the results of easing internal tensions and realizing strategic adjustments. In future East-West arms reduction talks, NATO's position may be strengthened. However, internal differences have not been completely eliminated, and this is reflected in the differing interpretations of the conference documents. For example, West Germany believes that since the "third zero option" was not mentioned in the documents, it means that it has not been ruled out as a possibility. In other words, NATO will continue to argue over the issue of denuclearization in Europe.

　　相互妥协　实现调整
    ——写在北约首脑会议之后
    本报记者  魏崴
    在庆祝北约成立４０周年之际召开的这次首脑会议，３０日在一片轻松的氛围中落下帷幕。
    会议的发展，可谓“三部曲”。第一部是“危机四伏”，达成一致的希望渺茫的论调不胫而走，连本来较为乐观的一些观察家也措词谨慎起来。第二部是“出现转机”。布什的裁军新建议出台，希望大增，５月２９日下午的工作会议虽然未获结果，但悲观阴霾开始消散，２９日—３０日夜间，１６国外长“激烈论战了整整一个通宵”。最后一部曲是“达成妥协”，３０日中午，首脑们发表了一个会议宣言，一个“整体构想”。曲终人散时，皆大欢喜。
    宣言的法文本共９页，英文本为１０页，计３７款，是“北约成立以来最长的一项宣言”，它较详尽地阐明了大西洋联盟的政治战略。“整体构想”更长，法文本１６页，英文本１７页，计６５款，是关于北约裁军战略的，自１９８７年６月着手起草，至今已近两年之久。两个文件都意在承上启下，继往开来，为北约未来的战略、任务和作用，勾勒出一个轮廓。从今后，北约可以沿着这两个文件设计的调整方向走下去了，步履当会沉重而又艰难，但总算是有路可循了。就是说，它将不断开展和苏联及东欧的全方位合作，影响东欧的改革，通过裁军会谈逐步使部署在整个欧洲的常规及核力量，削减到“最小限度”，慢慢摆脱战后形成的对峙格局，在西起大西洋，东至乌拉尔山脉建立起一个“和平的政治新秩序”。
    促成这两个文件问世的决定因素，是北约成员国领导人，特别是美国总统布什和西德总理科尔，在短导问题上相互作了让步。首先，在现代化上，两国近几个月来针锋相对，美国坚持现代化，西德坚决反对。“整体构想”中，把现代化的决定推迟到１９９２年后再作出，是美国作了妥协。西德诸国同意短导更新的研制工作由美国负责这一说法，是它们实际上向美国让步的表示。因为所谓现代化，目前只是个研制问题。其次，在谈判问题上，美国原本坚决拒绝和苏联谈判短导问题，西德等国则坚持“尽早”开谈。这次首脑会议上，诸方最后同意谈判，但附有几个条件：一是短导谈判必须与常规武器会谈挂钩，而且后者优先于前者。常规武器谈判达成协议并着手实施后，短导谈判才能开始。二是苏联在此期间得把它的短导压缩到和北约的同等数量，即也只有８８枚。三是如果短导谈判达成协议，也只能在常规武器谈判协议完全执行后，才可执行。由此观之，美国放弃了“不谈”，西德等放弃了“尽早”，后者的让步似乎更大些。最后，在“第三个零点方案”上，西德原是持赞成态度的。这次首脑会议的两个文件，对此均避而不谈。但意思是非常明白的，就是强调了短导谈判，仅涉及“部分短程核武器的裁减”，实际否定了“第三个零点方案”。看来，西德等国考虑到美国、英国及法国的强硬立场，未完全坚持己见。
    总而言之，此次首脑会议，由于各方让步，取得了缓和内部紧张关系，实现战略调整的成果。在今后的东西方裁军谈判中，北约地位可能有所加强。但是，内部分歧并未完全消除，反映在对会议文件的解释上，不尽相同。例如，西德认为“第三个零点方案”既未见诸于文字，就说明它并未被排除实现的可能。换句话说，在欧洲非核化问题上，北约还会继续争吵下去。
