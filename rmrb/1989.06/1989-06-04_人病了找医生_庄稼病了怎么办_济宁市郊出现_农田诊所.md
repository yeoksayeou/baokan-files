When people get sick, they see a doctor. But what about when crops get sick? On May 12, farmer Liu Qingzhong from Xiliucun Village in the suburbs of Jinan City, Shandong Province, hurried to the home of fellow villager Xie Yunfu, saying that the leaves of his 8 mu of wheat had suddenly turned yellow. After Xie Yunfu carefully inquired about the symptoms of the wheat disease, he took out a soil thermometer, slung a sprayer over his shoulder, and followed Liu to the wheat field. Farmers like Xie Yunfu, who are skilled in diagnosing and treating crop diseases, now number over 300 in this district.

The suburbs of Jinan are located on the northern shore of Weishan Lake in the southwestern part of Shandong Province, with over 700,000 mu of land. In the past, many plots of land were often affected by diseases, pests, and other natural disasters, making it difficult to increase grain production. Since 1986, the district has held over 480 training sessions on the prevention and treatment of crop diseases and pests for farmer technicians. After rigorous examinations, over 200 farmers have obtained high, intermediate, and primary technical titles. Soon, 102 specialized households for diagnosing and treating crop diseases emerged throughout the district, earning the nickname "field clinics" from the locals. Some are temporarily hired by farmers to inspect crop conditions, while others sign long-term contracts with farmers.

　　人病了找医生　庄稼病了怎么办
    济宁市郊出现“农田诊所”
    本报讯  人病了找医生，庄稼病了怎么办？５月１２日，山东济宁市郊区西五里营村农民刘庆忠急匆匆来到村民谢云福家，说是自己的８亩麦田叶子突然发黄。谢云福详细询问了小麦发病情况后，拿起地温计，背上喷雾器跟着他向麦田走去。类似谢云福这样的“庄稼大夫”，目前这个区已有３００多名。
    济宁郊区地处微山湖北岸的鲁西南平原，拥有７０多万亩土地，过去不少地块常受病虫等自然灾害的影响，粮食生产上升缓慢。１９８６年以来，这个区先后举办４８０多期有关农作物病虫害防治的农民技术员培训班。经过严格考试，２００多名农民获得高、中、初级技术职称。很快，全区出现了１０２个专门为庄稼“诊脉治病”的农技专业户，被乡亲们称作“农田诊所”。他们有的被农户临时请去查看庄稼病情，有的与农户签定了长期合同。　　　　　（谢迎秋）
