Xinhua News Agency, Geneva, June 13th.

The Chinese government representative today called for Vietnam to immediately stop policies that have led to a massive exodus of its own citizens and those of neighboring countries, and to fulfill its obligations to the international community to promote a permanent solution to the Indochina refugee problem.

The head of the Chinese delegation to the ongoing International Conference on Indochina Refugees in Geneva, China's Permanent Representative to the United Nations Office at Geneva, Ambassador Qian Jiaodong, said in his speech at the conference that the key to genuinely and thoroughly solving the refugee problem is to eliminate the root causes of refugee generation.

Ambassador Qian praised the conference for drafting and adopting a "Comprehensive Plan of Action" to address the Indochina refugee issue. However, he believed that countries producing refugees and those seeking asylum should commit to and take concrete measures to reduce and stop the large-scale outflow of their citizens. Additionally, they should unconditionally repatriate their citizens who have been identified as non-refugees after screening. Only then can the entire plan of action be effectively implemented.

In his speech, Qian also mentioned that due to the geographical location of China's southern coastal regions, some Vietnamese boat people pass through these areas on their way to their destinations. He told the conference attendees that the Chinese government is highly concerned about this issue and has already taken a series of corresponding measures.

The International Conference on Indochina Refugees, organized by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, opened this morning. The conference is attended by several hundred representatives from more than 40 countries and relevant international organizations. The conference is scheduled to conclude tomorrow.

　　我代表在印支难民国际会议上发言
    要求越停止导致难民产生的政策
    以促进印支难民问题永久性解决
    新华社日内瓦６月１３日电  中国政府代表今天在这里要求越南立即停止导致大批本国和邻国国民外流的政策，承担起对国际社会应尽的义务，以促进印支难民问题的永久性解决。
    出席正在日内瓦举行的印支难民国际会议的中国代表团团长、中国常驻联合国日内瓦办事处代表钱嘉东在大会发言中指出，要真正彻底解决难民问题，关键是必须消除产生难民的根源。
    钱嘉东大使对本次会议将制订并通过一项解决印支难民问题的“综合行动计划”表示赞赏。但他认为，产生难民和寻求庇护者的国家应承诺并切实采取措施减少和制止本国居民大规模外流，同时应无条件地接回经甄别确定为非难民的本国国民，只有这样，整个行动计划才能得以贯彻执行。
    钱嘉东在发言时还提到，由于中国南部沿海地区所处的地理位置，一些寻求庇护的越南船民在前往目的地途中路经这些地区。他对与会代表说，中国政府对这一问题极为关注，并已采取了一系列相应的措施。
    由联合国难民署主办的印支难民国际会议是在今天早上开幕的。参加会议的有来自４０多个国家及有关国际组织的数百名代表。会议定于明天结束。
