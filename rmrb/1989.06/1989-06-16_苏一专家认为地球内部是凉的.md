A Soviet expert believes that the Earth's interior is cold, not hot.

The Novosti news agency reported today that Mikhailov, a Soviet geologist and mineralogist, believes that the Earth's interior is cold. His argument is that the mantle rocks, which have been squeezed to the surface, contain liquid methane, liquid nitrogen, and liquid hydrogen. If the Earth's core were extremely hot, these liquids would vaporize. From this, he deduces that the asthenosphere is not hot but cold, and the temperature is low enough to liquefy hydrogen. The immense pressure within the Earth's interior destroys the crystal structure of the asthenosphere's minerals, turning them into cold, viscous magma.

Recent developments in the new field of thermobaric geochemistry and low-temperature chemistry also support the idea that the Earth's core is cold, not hot.

　　苏一专家认为地球内部是凉的
    新华社莫斯科六月十五日电  苏联地质学和矿物学副博士米赫因科认为，地球内部是凉的，而不是热的。
    米赫因科的论据是：被挤压到地表的地幔岩石晶体中混有液态甲烷、液氮和液氢。如果地心是炽热的，液态甲烷等就会被汽化。由此推断，岩流圈不是热的，而是凉的，而且温度低到使氢气能变成液态的程度。地球内部的强大压力破坏了岩流圈的矿石晶格，矿石变成了冰冷而粘稠的岩浆。前不久新生的学科——温压地质化学和低温化学提供的资料也证明地心是冷的，而不是热的。
