Tom Foley Elected as Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives

The U.S. House of Representatives yesterday elected Democrat Thomas Foley as the 49th Speaker of the House with 251 votes to 164, replacing Jim Wright, who resigned from the position due to allegations of violating ethical standards in personal financial activities.

In the subsequent inauguration ceremony, Foley expressed that he would work with Republican representatives in a spirit of cooperation and strengthened consultation, and called on members of both parties to join hands, abandoning resentment, division, and hostile sentiments.

Foley is a senior representative from the state of Washington, who has served as the House Majority Leader since 1987.
