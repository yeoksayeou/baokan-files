Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 14th.

During the period of martial law in parts of Beijing, two American journalists, Pan Aiwen of the Associated Press and Pei Xin of Voice of America, violated Chinese laws and regulations. Pan Aiwen, the Associated Press correspondent in Beijing, engaged in activities inconsistent with his journalist status. He frequently contacted leaders of illegal organizations, relayed messages for them, provided shelter, and illegally obtained state secrets. The Beijing Municipal State Security Bureau, acting on higher orders, summoned Pan Aiwen at 5 PM on June 14th and ordered him to leave China within 72 hours.

Additionally, Pei Xin, the Voice of America correspondent in Beijing, blatantly violated the third order issued by the Beijing Municipal Government during the martial law period. He conducted illegal reporting activities and published numerous reports that distorted facts, spread rumors, and incited and fomented turmoil and counter-revolutionary riots. The Beijing Municipal Government's Foreign Affairs Office notified Pei Xin at 4:30 PM on June 14th to leave China within 72 hours.
