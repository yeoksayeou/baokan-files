Letter to the Editor: Save the Yin Ruins Culture

Editorial Department:

Recently, a member of the Henan Provincial Political Consultative Conference, Liang Qing, issued an appeal to strengthen the protection and management of the Yin Ruins. The Anyang Yin Ruins are the site of the late Shang Dynasty's relocation to Yin by King Pan Geng, and are one of the earliest known ancient capitals in China with documented records and confirmed locations. The Yin Ruins were designated as one of the first batch of key cultural relics protection units by the State Council in 1961. In recent years, several international and domestic academic conferences on Shang Dynasty history and culture have been held here, and many international friends have visited, promoting cultural and academic exchanges between China and the rest of the world and fostering friendship. However, this ancient cultural treasure is being destroyed.

In recent years, some units have disregarded the national cultural relics protection law and engaged in illegal construction. The famous Yangshao, Longshan, and "three-layer culture" overlapping areas have been largely occupied by construction projects, with very little remaining. Along both sides of the Ansteel Road, there are more than ten illegal constructions.

In response to this situation, Commissioner Liang Qing appeals: We must strengthen the protection and management of the Yin Ruins. He suggests:

- The provincial government should issue a document requiring the entire society to seriously implement the cultural relics protection law and strengthen the protection of the Yin Ruins. In the future, any unit that engages in illegal construction should be held legally responsible by the relevant leaders. Those who steal or sell cultural relics should be severely punished by law.

- It is suggested to establish the Yin Ruins Museum. With a museum, cultural relics can be collected and stored, making it convenient to study the history of the Shang Dynasty. It can also educate the masses in patriotism and improve national cultural quality.

- Strengthen the study of Yin Ruins. The content of Yin Ruins studies is very rich, including not only history, archaeology, cultural studies, and ancient script studies, but also related natural sciences, such as bronze casting technology, white pottery firing technology, astronomy and calendar, animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, etc. It is suggested to establish a research institution for Yin Ruins studies, further collect and organize relevant materials, cultivate talents, and strengthen the study of Yin Ruins.

　　读者来信：救救殷墟文化
    编辑部：
    河南省政协委员梁晴最近发出呼吁，要求加强对殷墟的保护和管理。安阳殷墟是商代晚期盘庚迁殷的遗址，是我国目前有文献记载而又找到确切位置的最早古都之一。殷墟是１９６１年国务院公布的第一批重点文物保护单位。近几年来，一些国际、国内有关商代历史、文化的学术会议在此召开，不少国际友人到此参观，促进了中外学术文化的交流，增进了友谊。然而，这一古代文化的瑰宝正在遭到破坏。
    近几年来，有些单位不顾国家的文物保护法，大搞违章建筑。著名的仰韶、龙山及“三层文化”叠压区遗址，已被基建侵占所剩无几。安钢大道两侧，违章建筑就达十几家。
    针对这种状况，梁晴委员呼吁：要加强对殷墟的保护和管理。他建议：
    ——省政府应发出文件，要求全社会认真贯彻文物保护法，加强对殷墟的保护。今后凡是搞违章建筑的单位，要追究有关领导人的法律责任。对盗窃、倒卖文物者，要依法严惩。
    ——建议筹建殷墟博物馆。有了博物馆，既可收藏文物，便于研究商代历史，又可对广大群众进行爱国主义教育，提高民族文化素质。
    ——加强殷墟学的研究。殷墟学的内容非常丰富，不仅包括历史学、考古学、文化学、古文字学，也包括自然科学的有关学科，如青铜铸造技术、白陶烧制技术、天文历法、畜牧兽医学等。建议筹建殷墟学的研究机构，进一步收集整理有关资料，培养人才，加强殷墟学的研究。
