During the "Seventh Five-Year Plan" period, Shenyang Jinbei Automobile Co., Ltd. invested 400 million yuan in technological transformation, according to national regulations, 20% of this, or 80 million yuan, could be used for the construction of housing and other living facilities, which means that the living conditions of several thousand people could be improved. However, they did not do this, instead using 100% of the funds for technological transformation. The light trucks and tour buses they produced won first place in national industry evaluations for four consecutive years, with production increasing by more than twofold. The company's performance is top-tier in the national automobile industry and across all industries in the city, but the workers' income has always been controlled at the city's average level. General Manager Zhao Xiyou said: "Considering the future of the enterprise and increasing personal income, we cannot just think about the present. We still need to tighten our belts and first get the technological transformation done."

However, the "Jinbei people's" spirit of "tightening their belts" is seen by some as outdated; flaunting wealth, enjoying life, and competing in consumption have become a "fashion." Some enterprises and units use various pretexts to try to give out more money and goods, and even enterprises with poor performance do not want to fall behind. Many enterprises do not hesitate to divert production funds and technological transformation funds to build dormitories for their employees.

The "Jinbei people" have never forgotten a shameful figure: currently, the 100-plus automobile factories in our country produce 500,000 vehicles annually, which is only equivalent to one medium-sized automobile factory in the United States or Japan. This huge gap cannot be eliminated in a short time. Looking at the whole country, although after 10 years of reform and opening up, the economy has made great strides, it still has not shaken off the status of a poor country and the danger of being expelled from the global community. China's per capita national income still ranks below 100th in the world!

The country's fortunes are at stake, and the crisis is still present. Do not "warm the people to the point of intoxication, mistaking China for the United States," with the body of a poor country, going to compete in consumption with rich countries. Learn from Jinbei Company, have a bit of foresight.

　　金杯人的意识
    新华社记者  刘欣欣
    “七五”期间，沈阳金杯汽车股份有限公司技术改造投资４亿元，按国家规定可以拿出２０％即８０００万元的资金用于住宅等生活设施的建设，这意味着可以使几千人改善居住条件。可是他们没有这样做，百分之百的资金用于技术改造，生产的轻型货车和旅行车在全国同行业评比中连续４年夺魁，产量增长了两倍多。效益在全国汽车行业和全市各行业中都是一流的，但职工的收入始终控制在全市中等水平。总经理赵希友说：“从企业的前途和增加个人收入着想，不能只图眼前。我们还要勒紧裤带，先把技术改造搞上去。”
    然而，“金杯人”这种“勒紧裤带”的奋斗精神，有人认为不合时宜；摆阔、讲享受、攀比消费成为一种“时尚”。有的企业、单位以各种名目想方设法多发钱物，效益不太好的企业也不甘落后。还有不少企业不惜挪用生产基金和技术改造基金给职工建宿舍。
    “金杯”人始终没忘一个令人汗颜的数字：目前我国１００多家汽车厂５０万台的年产量，仅相当于美、日的一家中小型汽车厂，这个巨大的差距绝非短时间能消除的。再看全国，虽然经过１０年改革开放，经济有了长足的进步，但仍没摆脱穷国的地位和被开除球籍的危险，我国的人均国民收入在世界各国中的位次仍排在１００名以后！
    国运待兴，危机尚在。切莫“暖风熏得游人醉，错把中国当美国”，以穷国之身，去同富国攀比消费。学学金杯公司，有点长远的眼光。
