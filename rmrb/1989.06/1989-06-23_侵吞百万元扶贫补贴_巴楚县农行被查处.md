A notorious poverty-stricken county in Xinjiang, Baicheng, has seen a significant amount of state-subsidized agricultural funds embezzled by officials within the county's Agricultural Bank. The amount embezzled exceeds 10 million yuan. This was revealed recently by the Higher People's Court of the Xinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region.

An investigation found that 21 employees within the county's Agricultural Bank system took advantage of severe bureaucratism and financial mismanagement from 1986 to 1988. They embezzled public funds, with some stealing thousands of yuan and others stealing over 100,000 yuan. The total amount embezzled reached 1,160,000 yuan. The Kashgar Regional Court has handed down first-instance verdicts to 8 of the criminals, while 4 others are still under trial. Relevant departments have dismissed 8 individuals from their posts and expelled them from the party.

　　侵吞百万元扶贫补贴    
    巴楚县农行被查处
    本报乌鲁木齐６月２３日电  记者曾坤报道：靠吃国家大量补贴过日子的新疆著名贫困县之一的巴楚，国家补给的大量农业资金却被负责全县农业资金管理的县农行一些干部吞噬截留，数额高达百万元以上。这是日前自治区高级人民法院向记者公布的一桩大案。
    经查实，这个县农业银行系统有２１名业务人员，在１９８６年至１９８８年的三年中间，利用领导严重官僚主义和财务管理混乱的空子，大肆贪污公款，有的贪污数千元，有的贪污数１０万元，共计贪污公款１１６万元之多。喀什地区两级法院已对其中８名罪犯作出一审判决，另外４名罪犯正在审理之中。有关部门已对８人做了撤职、除名等政纪处理。
