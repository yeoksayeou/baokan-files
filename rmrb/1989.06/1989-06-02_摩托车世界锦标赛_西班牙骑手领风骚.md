Motorcycle racing has a wide influence around the world. The thrilling spectacle of speeding motorcycles and the adrenaline-pumping competition attract countless adventurous spirits.

Motorcycle racing is divided into off-road and track racing. Among these, the most attention-grabbing is the formal track racing—the World Championship.

The annual World Championship consists of 15 grand prix races, starting in late March and ending in mid to late September, spanning half a year. The venues are spread across Europe, America, Asia, and Oceania. The rider with the highest points from the 15 races is crowned the annual world champion.

The races are categorized into four levels based on the engine displacement of the motorcycles, and the results are calculated separately for each level.

Last year, Spanish riders secured three out of the four championships. Among them, Martinez Aspar won the championships in both the 80cc and 125cc categories. Prior to this, he had also won the 80cc category in 1986 and 1987, making him a three-time champion. Another Spanish rider, Sito Pons, won the 250cc category championship.

This year, the first race has already been held in Japan, and the final event is scheduled in Brazil. Currently, Martinez and Pons are leading in the 80cc and 250cc categories, respectively, and are poised to defend their titles.

　　摩托车世界锦标赛
    西班牙骑手领风骚
    摩托车运动在世界上有广泛的影响，铁骑奔腾、风驰电掣的竞逐场面，吸引着无数富于冒险精神的人们。
    摩托车运动分为越野赛和场地赛。其中，正规场地赛——世界锦标赛最引人注目。
    每年一届的世界锦标赛由１５场大奖赛组成，从３月下旬开始，至９月中下旬结束，历时半年。赛场分布在欧、美、亚和大洋洲。１５场比赛积分最高者为年度世界冠军。
    比赛按照摩托车的汽缸容积分为四个级别，分别计算成绩。
    去年的四项冠军被西班牙骑士占去了三项。其中，马丁内斯·阿斯帕尔一人夺得８０ＣＣ和１２５ＣＣ两个级别的冠军。在这之前，他还于１９８６和１９８７年两次在８０ＣＣ级别的比赛中夺魁，是位三连冠骑士。另一位名叫西托·彭斯的西班牙选手获得２５０ＣＣ级冠军称号。
    今年头场比赛已在日本举行，压轴戏安排在巴西。目前，马丁内斯和彭斯在８０ＣＣ和２５０ＣＣ级两个项目中分别处于领先地位，蝉联冠军有望。
