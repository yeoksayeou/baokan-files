Most of the border defense units I visited have horses, perhaps due to poor vehicle conditions and a lack of fuel.

When I arrived at C Company, they had just finished cutting grass for the winter. Currently, the cavalry of the field army has been mechanized, but some of our border defense companies still cannot do without horses for patrol and transportation. Therefore, there are many days in a year dedicated to cutting grass. In my memory, cutting grass is a very pleasant and aesthetically pleasing task: the autumn wind begins to blow, the grass turns slightly yellow, and the grass blades sway and ripple like a lake. On the bright and serene grassland, the soldiers, each wielding a large sickle, expose their healthy arms, and stand in a line. You can only hear the "swish, swish, swish, swish" of the sickles. Where the sickles pass, a neat fan-shaped area is cut. The posture and scene are simply like a painting! While cutting grass, occasionally a rabbit or a field mouse is startled, and everyone chases after it, adding a special joy to the labor. In fact, cutting grass is very tiring, and after a few days, one can lose a circle of weight.

At this time, the grasslands where C Company is located are covered with piles of fresh grass. They stretch and undulate, arranged in an orderly manner, like beacon towers or ancient fortresses.

The biggest enemy here is the "wildfire"—not necessarily man-made, sometimes caused by the intense direct sunlight causing spontaneous combustion. Since autumn, the Hulunbuir grasslands have not seen a drop of rain, and the drought is severe. The grass is so dry that it catches fire at the slightest spark. It is hard to notice during the day, but by night, it has already spread into a raging inferno.

The high watchtower of the company is used to observe border conditions, and at this time, watching for fires has also become a customary duty. Therefore, once there is a fire alarm, the company is always the first to respond.

C Company has a Red Flag Observation Post located in the triangular area of the Sino-Mongolian-Soviet border. For dozens of miles around, there are no houses, only a vast expanse of grassland in a single color. The post commander, Teng Jianhua, is an old soldier who has extended his service. When I met him, his hand was still wrapped in bandages, and his eyebrows had burns from the fire. He told me that a few days ago, a grassland caught fire, and the fire spread for 20 kilometers, turning the sky red. The fire had already reached the triangular area. At this time, the border guards from all three sides rushed out, each fighting the flames on their own territory. Seeing the Soviet soldiers using their clothes to extinguish the fire, and catching fire after a few swipes, our soldiers quickly threw them brooms and sticks. Everyone fought for a whole day and night, finally extinguishing the wildfire. I was deeply moved. The triangular area has always been a sensitive region, and a slight mistake could lead to an incident; but in the face of the wildfire, the soldiers united as one, involuntarily forming a single entity. What kind of centripetal force is this?

In the brigade, I heard that Teng Jianhua had faced several setbacks in his marriage and had recently been introduced to another girl. But during the firefighting, his face was blackened with soot, how would he meet his girlfriend? Before enlisting, he was a formal worker, and last year, his family had helped him find a job. His girlfriend was ready to marry him, like a warm spring standing in the courtyard of his hometown waiting for him. The company also wanted to help him, and when he left, the soldiers at the post carried his luggage to send him off, and everyone cried. Teng Jianhua's heart was complicated, torn between his comrades he had lived with day and night and the girl's expectations. The car had just started when he received a call from the brigade, saying that an old soldier was needed at this point, and he was asked to stay. Teng Jianhua agreed readily and continued to fulfill his duty and responsibility at this post in the triangular area. The soldiers cheered, but the girlfriend's hopes were dashed again. The brigade leaders learned of this and were very uneasy, again trying every means to find him a girlfriend in a certain place. The girl was a beautiful and talented worker in a shoe factory, and they agreed to meet today...

"Will she be scared seeing you like this?" I heard that he was going to the city for the date, so I asked him. He smiled innocently and said, "If she is scared by this, what if something really bad happens?" He was frank and confident, as if there was indeed happiness waiting for him. I thought: this happiness is contained in the green border grass swaying, contained in the blood-red twilight of the triangular area, contained in that high watchtower where you can see the flickering lights of the border nomads through the observation hole.

I was moved by his sincerity and silently blessed him.

When we rode in the same car and passed by the grasslands of the triangular area, I couldn't help but worry for him again: originally a handsome and sprightly young man, after being licked by the wildfire, he had turned into a "thunder god." Would the girl like him?

After parting, I kept thinking about the outcome of his date. Perhaps my worries were unnecessary. Although girls have different aesthetic requirements for choosing a partner, the beauty of the soul is still an important standard, especially since a "wildfire" cannot burn away Little Teng's original handsomeness. When the spring breeze turns the grasslands green again, the young man will surely regain his original appearance!

　　野火
    曾凡华
    我所走的边防一线的几个中队几乎都有马，也许是车况不佳及油料缺乏所致。
    我到Ｃ中队的时候，他们刚打完马草，在做越冬的储备了。目下野战集团军的骑兵已被机械化所替代，但我们有的边防中队仍然离不开马，巡逻、运输都要用的，因此，一年中打马草的时日不在少数。在我的印象里，打马草是极惬意、极富美感的活儿：秋风乍起，牧草微黄，草叶翻覆涌动，犹如一汪湖水。在明媚、沉静的草甸子上，战士们一人抡一把大钐刀，胳膊袒露出健康的美，一字儿排开，只听得“唰、唰、唰、唰”！钐刀响处，齐崭崭削出一个扇面来。那姿势那场面，简直是一幅画！打草中，间或惊起一两只野兔、田鼠之类，大伙儿围扑一阵，算是劳作间一种特别的乐趣。其实打草是很累人的，几天下来，就得瘦去一圈。
    这会儿，Ｃ中队所在的牧区草场，到处是一垛垛新草。绵延起伏，错落有致，像烽火台又像古代的城堡。
    此间的大敌是“野火”——不一定是人为的，有时也因强烈阳光的直射而引起自燃。入秋以来，呼伦贝尔草原一直滴雨未落，旱情严重，牧草干得一点就着。白天难以觉察，到了夜间，已成燎原之势了。
    中队那高高的哨塔是用来观察边情的，到了这时，瞭望火情也成了约定俗成的义务。因此一旦有了火警，中队总是率先出动。
    Ｃ中队有个红旗观察哨，位于中、蒙、苏边境的三角地带。周围几十里没有人家，全是单色调的一片草地。“哨长”滕建华是个超期服役的老兵。我见到他时，手上还缠着纱布，眉毛有被火舔过的痕迹。他告诉我，前几天一处草场着了火，大火蔓延２０公里，天都红了，火头已蹿到三角地带。这时，三方的边防军人都出动了，各自在自己的国土上扑打烈火。见到苏军士兵用衣服扑火，扑几下就着了，我们的战士忙扔给他们笤帚和木棍。大家奋战了整整一天一夜，终于把野火扑灭了。对此，我感慨良多。三角地带历来是最敏感的区域，稍有不慎就会酿成事端；但在野火面前，军人们却同仇敌忾，不由自主地结成了一体。这是一种什么样的向心力呢？
    在支队里我听说，滕建华在婚姻上几度碰壁，最近又给他介绍一个，可救火时脸熏黑了，将如何去和对象见面呢？他入伍前是正式工人，去年家里已帮他联系了工作，对象准备同他完婚，像温馨的春天一般，站在故乡的小院里等着他。中队里也想成全他，临行，哨所战士们扛着行李送他，全哭了。滕建华内心是复杂的，一边是朝夕相处的战友，一边是姑娘的期盼。车刚开动，接到支队一个电话，说这个点上没个老兵不行，要他留下。滕建华欣然从命，在三角地这个哨卡上，继续尽他的义务和责任。战士们一片欢呼，可对象却又一次吹了“灯”。支队领导得知此事，很觉不安，又千方百计给他在某地找了个对象，姑娘是个品貌兼优的制鞋厂工人，相约今天见面……
    “她见了你这副模样，不会吓坏吧！”我听说他要进城赴约，便问他。他憨然一笑，说：“这样就吓坏了，要是有个三长两短咋办？”坦然而自信，好象前面真有幸福在等着他。我想：这幸福，就包含在绿茵茵的边草的颤动里，包含在三角地的血色的黄昏中，包含在那座可以透过瞭望孔看见边地牧民点闪闪灯火的高高的哨塔上。
    我被他的赤诚感动了，暗暗为他祝福。
    当我们同乘一辆车，路过三角地带那一片草场时，又禁不住替他犯起愁来：本来眉清目秀、利利索索一个小伙子，被这野火一舔，简直成了个“雷公”，姑娘能看得上吗？
    分手之后，我一直惦着他这次相亲的结局。也许，我的担心是多余的，虽然姑娘有各自择侣的不同审美要求，但心灵美依然是重要标准，更何况一场“野火”也烧不掉小滕本来的英俊。待春风再度吹绿草原，小伙子定会恢复他本来的容颜！
