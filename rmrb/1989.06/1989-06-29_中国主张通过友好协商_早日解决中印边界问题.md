China has consistently advocated for resolving the Sino-Indian border issue through friendly negotiations, based on the principles of mutual understanding and compromise, to achieve a fair and reasonable solution as soon as possible.

At a press conference this afternoon, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Li Jinhua stated that from June 30 to July 4, the first round of talks between the Sino-Indian Border Affairs Joint Working Group and vice-ministerial-level consultations between the two countries will be held in Beijing. The two sides will discuss the border issue, bilateral relations, and exchange views on international issues of mutual concern.

She added that before the border issue is resolved, both sides should strive to maintain stability and tranquility in the border areas. While seeking a resolution to the border issue, both sides should also work to strengthen friendly exchanges and cooperation in other fields.
