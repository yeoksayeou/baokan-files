Two years ago on May 29, our newspaper published the news "Ma Steel High-Speed Wire Rod Mill Trial Run Successful." Recently, I received a letter from this factory: "...Ma Steel's modern baby—the High-Speed Wire Rod Mill—has turned two. We hope you can come and see her again, and contribute your love to her growth..." I hurried over. What I saw and heard was truly inspiring: the factory area inside and out was tidy and clean, and the production order was well-organized. The factory party secretary, Wen Long, told me: This set of equipment, which has reached world advanced levels, has its main machine imported from the Federal Republic of Germany, while most of the other equipment is domestically produced or jointly manufactured by China and foreign countries. Calculated by the weight of the equipment, the total weight is 5,330 tons. Of this, 1,453 tons are imported, 2,228 tons are domestically produced, and 1,649 tons are jointly manufactured by China and foreign countries. After two years of trial production, it has produced 370,000 tons of high-quality steel, realizing a profit and tax of over 120 million yuan, already recouping half of the investment in building the factory. This year, it can produce 300,000 tons of wire rods...

As we were talking, an engineer handed me a congratulatory message from the German company Snoerman Westmark AG: "Congratulations to Ma Steel, this is the world's fastest wire rod mill, a symbol of high-speed wire rod rolling technology in the 1990s!"

How fast is it? At its best, it can roll out 120 meters of wire rod per second. Each wire rod is over 4 kilometers long. It not only can produce conventional wire rods used in high-rise buildings but has also batch-produced 16 new varieties including stainless steel, bearing steel, welding rod steel, cold-headed steel, and spring steel. These wire rods not only replaced imported wire rods, saving foreign exchange, but also entered the Japanese, Southeast Asian, and Hong Kong markets, receiving welcome from customers.

Comrade Wen Long told me: Ma Steel has added a foreign baby, and both Chinese and foreign people praise her. Our 800 employees naturally cherish her even more, so they always steadfastly ensure production despite any storms.

　　两岁“现代娃”    
    ——再访马钢高速线材厂
    本报记者  张振国
    两年前的５月２９日，本报发表了《马钢高速线材轧机试车成功》的消息。日前，记者接到这个厂的一封信：“……马钢的现代娃娃——高速线材厂已两岁了，希望您能再来看看她的姿容，为她的茁壮成长再尽一份爱心……”
    我赶去了。所见所闻，实在令人振奋：厂区内外整齐清洁，生产秩序井井有条。厂党委书记闻龙对我说：这套具有世界先进水平的轧机，其主机是从联邦德国引进，其他大部分设备均为国产或中外合制。按设备重量计算，总重为５３３０吨。其中进口１４５３吨，国产２２２８吨，中外合制１６４９吨。试产两年，已产优质钢材３７万多吨，实现利税１．２亿多元，已赚回建厂投资的一半，今年可产线材３０万吨……
    正谈之间，一位工程师递给我一份署名为联邦德国斯诺曼西马克股份公司发来的祝词：“向马钢祝贺，这是世界上最高速的线材轧机，是９０年代高速线材轧制工艺的象征！”
    她高速到什么程度呢？最佳时，一秒钟已能轧出１２０米线材。每根线材长达４公里多。她不仅可以生产高层建筑使用的常规线材，而且已成批轧出不锈钢、轴承钢、焊条钢、冷镦钢、弹簧钢等１６个新品种。这些线材，不仅替代了进口线材，节约了外汇，还打入日本、东南亚及香港市场，受到客商的欢迎。
    闻龙同志告诉我：马钢添个洋娃娃，中外人士都夸她，我厂８００名职工自然倍加疼爱，所以始终是任凭风浪起，稳把生产关。
