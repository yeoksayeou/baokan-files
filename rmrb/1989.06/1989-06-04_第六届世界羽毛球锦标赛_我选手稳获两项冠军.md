The Sixth World Badminton Championships

Chinese Athletes Secure Two Titles

YAKARTA, June 3 (Xinhua) — Tonight, the enthusiastic but biased Indonesian spectators at the Sixth World Badminton Championships half-finals finally applauded the superb skills of Chinese athletes. In all five events, Chinese athletes have secured the championship and runner-up positions in women's singles and men's doubles, with one athlete (pair) each in men's singles and women's doubles advancing to the finals.

The athletes who have secured spots in the finals are: Men's singles, Yang Yang (China) and Rohana Nurdin (Indonesia); Women's singles, Li Lingwei and Huang Hua (China); Men's doubles, Li Yongbo/Tian Bingyi and Chen Kang/Chen Hongyong (China); Women's doubles, Lin Ying/Guan Weizhen (China) and Chung So-young/Chung Myung-hee (South Korea); Mixed doubles, Park Joo-bong/Chung So-young (South Korea) and Hong Chong/Veronika (Indonesia).

Yang Yang and Sugiarto pushed today's matches to a climax. "Whenever Yang plays, Sugiarto loses," but in the cheers of his countrymen, Sugiarto, with his fierce smashes and excellent net play, won the first game 15-13. In the second game, Yang Yang, with his delicate touch and aerial smashes to the corners, took the lead from the start and equalized the score. In the decisive game, Yang Yang saw that his opponent was already out of breath and launched a series of attacks, leading 8-0. The audience began to applaud his superb skills. At this moment, his stamina also began to wane, and Sugiarto gradually caught up. At the critical moment, Yang Yang changed his tactics, using drop shots and lobs to tire out his opponent, finally winning 15-9, securing his 12th victory in 13 matches against Sugiarto.

In the women's singles, 19-year-old Huang Hua lost the first game 8-11 to Indonesia's Sarwendah. However, in the next two games, she played to her usual standard, winning 11-7 and 11-2 against her opponent.

In the men's doubles, Chen Kang's powerful backcourt smashes and Chen Hongyong's timely net play controlled the entire court. They defeated the world-renowned Indonesian pair, Hong Chong/Koh Hong Choon, with scores of 15-10 and 15-9.

Li Yongbo/Tian Bingyi defeated their old rivals, the Malaysian pair Razif Sidek/Jalani Sidek, with scores of 15-10 and 15-9.

China's two mixed doubles pairs, Wang Pengren/Shi Fangjing and Wu Chibing/Yang Xinfeng, lost to Indonesia's Hong Chong/Veronika and South Korea's Park Joo-bong/Chung So-young with scores of 1-2 and 0-2, respectively.

Li Lingwei won against her teammate Tang Jiuhong with scores of 6-11, 11-8, and 11-2. In the women's doubles, Lin Ying/Guan Weizhen defeated Sweden's Maria Bengtsson/Bengt Fröman with scores of 15-2 and 15-3. Sun Xiaqing/Zhou Lei lost to South Korea's Chung So-young/Hwang Hye-young with scores of 1-2 (15-13, 11-15, 4-15).

　　第六届世界羽毛球锦标赛
    我选手稳获两项冠军
    新华社雅加达６月３日电（记者梁金雄、周宗欣）狂热而偏向的印度尼西亚观众今晚在第六届世界羽毛球锦标赛半决赛中，首次为中国选手的精彩球艺鼓起掌来。在全部５项比赛中，中国选手已稳获女单和男双的冠、亚军，男单及女双也各有一人（对）进入决赛。
    获得各项决赛权的选手是：男单，杨阳（中国）、罗天宁（印尼）；女单，李玲蔚、黄华（中国）；男双，李永波／田秉毅、陈康／陈红勇（中国）；女双，林瑛／关渭贞（中国）、郑明熙／黄惠英（南朝鲜）；混双，朴柱奉／郑明熙（南朝鲜）、洪忠中／维拉华蒂（印尼）。
    杨阳与苏吉亚托把今天来的比赛推向高潮。“逢杨必败”的苏吉亚托，在同胞的喊叫声中，发挥其扣球凶狠、网前球好的特长，以１５∶１３险胜首局。第二局，杨阳以细腻的手上功夫和跃起突击杀两角的绝招，一路领先，扳回一局。决胜局，杨阳见对手已经气喘吁吁，连连进攻，以８∶０领先，场上观众开始为他的高超球艺鼓起掌来。此时，他的体力也渐不足，苏吉亚托渐渐追上来。关键时刻，杨阳改变战术，以放网前、拉后场调动对手，终以１５∶９取得同苏吉亚托交锋１３场中的第１２次胜利。
    １９岁的黄华在同印尼的萨尔文达交手中，先以８∶１１失一分。但在后两局中，她发挥正常，以１１∶７和１１∶２轻取对手。
    男子双打，陈康的后场大力扣杀，陈红勇的前场及时封网，控制了全场。他们以１５∶１０，１５∶９击败了世界名将、印尼的洪忠中／郭宏源。
    李永波／田秉毅一对以１５∶１０，１５∶９挫败老对手、马来西亚的拉·西德克／贾·西德克。
    我国两对混双选手王朋仁／史方静、吴赤兵／杨新芳分别以１∶２和０∶２负于印尼的洪忠中／维拉华蒂和南朝鲜名将朴柱奉／郑明熙。
    李玲蔚是以６∶１１、１１∶８、１１∶２战胜队友唐九红的。女双林瑛／关渭贞以１５∶２、１５∶３轻取瑞典的玛格努松／本特松。孙小青／周雷则以１∶２（１５∶１３、１１∶１５、４∶１５）负于南朝鲜的郑明熙／黄惠英。
