To all Communist Party members and the people of all ethnic groups in the nation:

The current situation in Beijing is grave. For over a month, a tiny number of people with ulterior motives have deliberately created turmoil. Starting from the early hours of June 3, this turmoil has developed into a shocking counter-revolutionary rebellion.

A tiny number of rioters have incited some people who are unaware of the truth to commit various atrocities. They have blocked the entry of martial law troops into the city and Tiananmen Square to carry out martial law; they have destroyed, burned, and set fire to over 100 military and public vehicles; they have insulted, beaten, and kidnapped cadres, soldiers, and armed police; they have seized guns, ammunition, and other military equipment; they have stormed Zhongnanhai, the Great Hall of the People, the Central Broadcasting and Television Building, public security organs, and other key government departments; they have looted stores and burned police stations. They have also brutally murdered dozens of People's Liberation Army soldiers and armed police, even hanging the bodies of soldiers they have murdered on overpass railings. Their goal in causing the rebellion is to deny the leadership of the Party, deny the socialist system, and overthrow the People's Republic of China. They openly shout slogans such as "take up arms and overthrow the government" and openly call for "killing 47 million Communist Party members." The planners and organizers of this counter-revolutionary rebellion are mainly a tiny number of people who have long stubbornly adhered to a bourgeois liberalization stance, engaged in political intrigue, colluded with hostile forces overseas and abroad, and provided state and Party core secrets to illegal organizations. The main perpetrators of various acts of violence, looting, arson, and destruction are some unrepentant released criminals, some political hooligan gangs, remnants of the Gang of Four, and other social dregs. In short, they are a group of reactionaries who harbor deep hatred for the Communist Party and the socialist system. It is well known that for over a month, the government has repeatedly adopted a tolerant and restrained attitude towards the turmoil created by a tiny number of people who have deceived the masses. However, a tiny number of people thought the government was weak and could be bullied, and they escalated their activities, finally launching a counter-revolutionary rebellion.

Faced with this serious situation, the People's Liberation Army martial law troops, having endured to the limit, took decisive measures to resolutely suppress this rebellion. To avoid injuring innocent people, starting from the afternoon of the 3rd, they repeatedly issued urgent announcements, urging the majority of students and citizens not to obstruct the martial law troops from carrying out their duties. During the suppression, the martial law troops did their utmost to avoid bloodshed. However, a tiny number of rioters paid no heed and launched a frenzied attack on the martial law troops. In this situation, some casualties occurred, most of whom were soldiers and armed police. This is something we do not want to see. However, if we do not take this action, the rebellion cannot be suppressed, and more and larger-scale bloodshed would occur. The People's Republic, for which tens of millions of martyrs have sacrificed their lives, would be in danger of being overthrown, the achievements of socialist construction and 10 years of reform would be in danger of being destroyed, and the entire nation would be in danger of being engulfed in a white terror. Therefore, resolutely suppressing this rebellion is a just action and is in line with the wishes and fundamental interests of the people of Beijing and the nation.

Relying on the heroic struggle of the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army martial law troops, the armed police, and public security personnel, and relying on the active cooperation and support of the broad masses of the people and young students, we have achieved the first victory in suppressing the rebellion. However, we must be soberly aware that the counter-revolutionary rebellion has not been completely suppressed, and a tiny number of rioters will not accept defeat. They will wait for an opportunity to counterattack and create various incidents. All Party comrades and the people of the nation must heighten their vigilance, keep their eyes open, unite as one, and resolutely fight against them to defend the achievements of the revolution, construction, and reform. As long as they dare to continue causing trouble, we will fight them to the end. We have the guidance of Marxism, a powerful people's democratic dictatorship, tens of millions of Communist Party members, millions of soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who are loyal to the Party and the people, and the strong support of the broad masses of workers, peasants, intellectuals, various democratic parties, and patriotic people from all walks of life. We have the strength and confidence to completely defeat them and completely suppress this rebellion.

All Communist Party members, the broad masses of the people, and patriotic people from all walks of life must respond to the call of the Party and the government, distinguish right from wrong, consider the overall situation, take immediate action, stand up and resolutely fight against the tiny number of people who create turmoil, and not do anything that will cause pain to friends and joy to enemies. Believe that the Party and the government have the ability to stop the turmoil. Communist Party members must set an example and play a model leading role everywhere. The broad cadres and workers must stick to their posts, do a good job in production, ensure supply, and actively maintain social order and normal social order. Party and government organizations at all levels must strengthen positive guidance and ideological and political work, patiently educate young students and the broad masses, not to easily believe and spread rumors, and not to engage in any form of linkage. Strive to create a stable and good social environment, unite as one and continue to push forward the construction and reform.

### 中共中央、国务院  告全体共产党员和全国人民书

专栏：

　　中共中央、国务院
    告全体共产党员和全国人民书
    全体共产党员、全国各族人民：
    目前，首都北京形势严峻。一个多月来，极少数别有用心的人，蓄意制造动乱。从６月３日凌晨起，这种动乱已经发展成为一场骇人听闻的反革命暴乱。
    极少数暴乱分子煽动一些不明真相的人，制造了种种暴行。他们拦截戒严部队进驻市区和天安门广场执行戒严任务；砸毁、焚烧军车和公用车１００余辆；辱骂、殴打和绑架干部战士和武警官兵、公安干警；抢夺枪支弹药和其他军用设备；冲击中南海、人民大会堂、中央广播电视大楼、公安机关等首脑要害部门；抢劫商店和烧毁警察岗楼。他们还惨无人道地杀害几十名解放军战士和武警战士，甚至把被他们残害的战士尸体悬挂于立交桥栏杆上。他们进行暴乱的目的，就是要否定党的领导，否定社会主义制度，颠复中华人民共和国。他们公然喊出“拿起武器，推翻政府”的口号，公然叫嚷“要杀死四千七百万共产党党徒”。这次反革命暴乱的策划者和组织者，主要是极少数长期顽固坚持资产阶级自由化立场、搞政治阴谋的人，同海外、国外敌对势力相勾结的人，向非法组织提供党和国家核心机密的人。出面制造打、砸、抢、烧等种种暴行的，主要是一些没有改造好的刑满释放分子，一些政治性的流氓团伙，四人帮的残渣余孽和其他社会渣滓。总之，他们是一伙对共产党和社会主义制度有刻骨仇恨的反动分子。众所周知，一个多月来，政府对极少数人蒙蔽群众制造的动乱一再采取忍让、克制的态度。但是极少数人以为政府软弱可欺，变本加厉进行活动，终于发动了反革命暴乱。
    面对这种严重局面，中国人民解放军戒严部队在忍无可忍的情况下，采取果断的措施，坚决平息这场暴乱。为避免误伤好人，从３日下午开始一再发出紧急通告，劝说广大学生和市民不要妨碍戒严部队执行任务。在平息过程中，戒严部队又尽了最大努力避免流血。但是极少数暴徒置若罔闻，对戒严部队发动疯狂袭击，在这种情况下，发生了一些伤亡，其中多数是解放军和武警战士。这是我们很不愿意看到的。但是，不这样做，暴乱就不能平息，那就要发生更多更大的流血事件。几千万先烈用生命换来的人民共和国就可能被颠复，社会主义建设和１０年改革的成果就可能毁于一旦，全国就可能笼罩在一片白色恐怖之中。因此，果断地平息这场暴乱，完全是正义的行动，是符合首都人民和全国人民的愿望和根本利益的。
    依靠人民解放军戒严部队的官兵和武警官兵、公安干警的英勇斗争，依靠广大人民群众和青年学生的积极配合和支持，我们已经取得了平息暴乱的第一步胜利。但是必须清醒地看到，反革命暴乱还未完全平息，极少数暴乱分子是绝不会甘心失败的。他们还会伺机反扑，制造种种事端。全党同志和全国人民，务必提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，团结一致，同他们进行坚决的斗争，保卫革命、建设和改革的成果。只要他们胆敢继续捣乱下去，我们就同他们斗争到底。我们有马克思主义的指导，有强大的人民民主专政，有几千万共产党员，有几百万忠于党忠于人民的解放军，有广大工人、农民、知识分子、各民主党派和各界爱国人士的大力支持，我们完全有力量有信心彻底战胜他们，彻底平息这场暴乱。
    全体共产党员、广大人民群众和各界爱国人士，一定要响应党和政府的号召，明辨是非，顾全大局，迅速行动起来，挺身而出与制造暴乱的极少数人作坚决的斗争，而不要做任何亲痛仇快的事情。要相信党和政府有能力制止暴乱，共产党员要处处以身作则，起模范带头作用。广大干部职工要坚守岗位，搞好生产，保障供给，积极维护社会治安和社会正常秩序。各级党政组织，要加强正面疏导和思想政治工作，耐心教育青年学生和广大群众，不要轻信和传播谣言，不要进行任何形式的串联，为稳定局势创造安定和良好的社会环境而斗争，同心同德把建设和改革继续推向前进。
