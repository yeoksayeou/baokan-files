The "Riva" singing group from Zadar, Yugoslavia, won the top prize in the 34th Eurovision Song Contest held this May, marking the country's first victory in this competition. The "Riva" group consists of one professional musician and members who are a sociology professor, an elementary school teacher, and a university student majoring in foreign languages.

Yugoslavia is a land where mass art blooms everywhere. Whether in famous theaters in major cities like Belgrade, scenic tourist spots like the Adriatic Sea, or open-air stages in villages across the country, during grand events welcoming guests or celebrating festivals, one can almost always see amateur performers dressed in vibrant costumes, skillfully showcasing their talents with enthusiastic songs and dances, earning waves of applause. According to friends in the Yugoslavian arts community, there are 1,890 amateur art associations in Serbia alone, with over 400,000 amateur artists.

Each republic and autonomous province in Yugoslavia has an amateur art association federation. The thousands of affiliated amateur art associations scattered across various regions, factories, enterprises, institutions, and schools are essentially comprehensive art groups. They have various sub-groups such as choirs, drama, folk music, fine arts, poetry recitation, modern ballet, and folk dances. Participants join voluntarily without any restrictions. Each art group is divided into children's and adult classes, with each person participating in about three activities per week, guided by experts. After a period of practice, if someone finds it unsuitable, they can freely switch groups or withdraw. Once they reach a certain level, they can perform on amateur stages. The activity fees mainly come from the earnings of amateur performances. Performers do not receive any remuneration but enjoy free meals, accommodation, and transportation.

Many dancers, singers, musicians, and art groups that are currently popular in Yugoslavia, as well as leaders of art academies, have all received their initial training and inspiration from amateur art groups. Even after gaining fame, they do not forget their roots and often return to guide the amateur art groups, either directly on the rehearsal stage or by participating in the work of the federation's art committees.

Except for a few full-time staff like the secretary-general, the rest of the Yugoslavian Amateur Art Association Federation is composed of part-time art and social celebrities from various fields. They help publish amateur art magazines, write instructional materials on sculpture, ceramics, recitation, and other arts, and write scripts and compose music for amateur theater groups. During amateur art performances and competitions, they assist in selecting programs and awarding prizes. All these works are done voluntarily or with only symbolic remuneration. Thanks to the experts' hard work and cultivation, many amateur art groups have reached a high level. They often represent Yugoslavia in overseas performances and competitions. Three amateur art groups from Serbia, including Obrazovici, have visited China.

To promote mass cultural activities, Yugoslavia frequently holds various art exchanges and performances. These performances and exhibitions are either free to the public or charge very low ticket prices.

The secretary-general of the Serbian Amateur Art Association Federation told reporters during an interview that culture and art are created by the people and should be enjoyed by them. The more mass cultural activities develop, the more they can break the monopoly of culture and art by a few people.

　　这里盛开群众文艺之花
    本报记者  严正
    今年５月举行的第３４届欧洲广播联盟歌曲大赛中，南斯拉夫扎达尔“里瓦”演唱小组艺压群芳，为自己的国家首次摘取了此项比赛的桂冠。“里瓦”演唱小组只有１名专职音乐工作者，其余的成员为社会学教授、小学教师、外语系大学生……　　南斯拉夫处处盛开群众文艺之花。无论在贝尔格莱德等大城市的著名剧院里，还是在亚得里亚海等风景优美的旅游区，以及全国各乡村的露天舞台上，在欢迎佳宾、喜庆节日的盛会中，几乎随时随地都能见到那些身穿艳服、技艺娴熟、热情奔放的业余演员以欢歌乐舞博得阵阵赞美声。据南斯拉夫艺术界朋友告诉记者，仅在塞尔维亚共和国就有１８９０个业余艺术协会，４０多万业余艺术大军。
    南斯拉夫各共和国和自治省都建有业余艺术协会联合会，所属的数以千计分散在各地区、厂矿企业、机关学校的业余艺术协会实际上都是些综合性的艺术团体，分别建有合唱、话剧、民乐、美术、诗歌朗诵、现代芭蕾、民间舞蹈等小组，参加者自愿报名，无任何限制，每个艺术组分为儿童班和成人班，每人每周活动３次左右，有专家指导，经过一段实践后，如有人觉得不合适可以自由转组或退出，当他们达到一定水平时，就走上业余演出舞台。其活动费用主要来自业余演出所得。参加演出的人员均无报酬，只享受免费食宿和交通。
    目前在南斯拉夫走红的许多舞蹈家、歌唱演员、音乐家以及艺术团体、艺术院校的领导，都曾在业余艺术团体受到启蒙和熏陶，他们成名后仍不忘回娘家，有的直接到业余文艺团体排练现场进行艺术指导，有的参加联合会各艺术委员会的工作。
    南斯拉夫业余艺术协会联合会除秘书长等极少数专职干部外，其余全由来自各界的艺术名家和社会名流业余兼任。他们帮助出版业余文艺刊物、编写雕塑、陶瓷艺术、朗诵常识等知识性的辅导材料，为业余剧团编写剧本、谱曲作词；在进行业余文艺会演时，帮助选拔节目和评奖，所有这些工作都是义务的，或只给一些象征性的酬金。由于专家的辛勤耕耘和培植，使许多业余艺术团体达到很高的水平，它们经常代表南斯拉夫出国演出，参加比赛，塞尔维亚共和国奥布拉舍维奇等３个业余艺术团体曾先后访问过我国。
    为了繁荣群众文化活动，南斯拉夫经常举行各种文艺观摩和会演。这些演出和展览都向群众免费开放，或者收取价格很低的门票。
    塞尔维亚业余艺术协会联合会秘书长在接受记者采访时说，文化艺术本是人民群众创造的，因此应该成为他们的享受品，群众文化活动越发展，就越能打破少数人对文化艺术的垄断。
