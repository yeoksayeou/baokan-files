The Fruit of Sino-Burundian Friendship and Cooperation — A Visit to the Bujumbura Joint Textile Factory
Xinhua News Agency reporter Liu Shangyang

“Are you going to ‘Haute Taille’?” As I walked out of the Bujumbura International Airport building, a taxi driver mistook me for a Chinese expert from “Haute Taille” and approached me to offer a ride, exclaiming, “‘Haute Taille’ is great, it’s like this!”

It turns out that “Haute Taille” is the French abbreviation for the Bujumbura Joint Textile Factory, a name that is almost universally known in Burundi. It is a very successful project of Sino-Burundian cooperation. Locals praise it, saying: With “Haute Taille,” Burundi has ended the history of importing cotton cloth; “Haute Taille” stands out among Burundian state-owned enterprises for its high profits and good economic benefits; “Haute Taille” products are renowned domestically and internationally, bringing honor to Burundi. Thus, I postponed other interview tasks and first visited “Haute Taille.”

“Haute Taille” is located in the vast plains to the northeast of Bujumbura. The factory, covering an area of over 35,000 square meters, has four main workshops: spinning, weaving, dyeing, and power generation, with a total of 1,700 employees. It is the largest state-owned enterprise in Burundi. After the factory was completed and handed over to the Burundian side in 1980, technical cooperation with the Chinese side continued. Factory Director Jean Kabura and the leader of the Chinese technical team, Sun Daqiang, sent by Anhui Province, introduced to the reporter that since 1986, the grey cloth produced by the factory has won the gold medal at the Madrid International Textile and Apparel Exhibition for three consecutive years.

“Haute Taille” started production in 1980 and only began to make a profit in the fourth quarter of 1982. Since 1986, it has made a profit of over four million US dollars annually. The factory’s annual output has long reached its designed capacity. Today, “Haute Taille” plays an indispensable role in Burundi’s national economy. “Haute Taille” produces high-quality substitute import products, especially printed fabrics with 1,700 varieties, meeting the clothing needs of women nationwide, making Burundi no longer need to import cotton cloth, thus saving the country a large amount of foreign exchange; moreover, since 1986, the factory has started exporting part of its products, earning foreign exchange for the country. Burundi is a cotton-producing country, with an annual output of about four thousand tons. In the past, all cotton was exported, making it subject to the international market. Now, “Haute Taille” can consume most of the domestically produced cotton, solving the sales problem of domestic cotton. Burundi, with the second-highest population density in Africa, has a serious unemployment problem. The establishment of “Haute Taille” has solved the unemployment problem for a large number of people.

“Haute Taille” currently has several million US dollars in bank deposits. To address supply and demand issues, the factory is preparing to expand. Recently, both sides of Sino-Burundian cooperation have reached an agreement to use the factory’s own funds, with the Chinese side undertaking the expansion project and providing 10,000 spindles of equipment, with construction to begin this year.

Kabura pointed out in his introduction, “The Chinese experts’ work quality is high and very satisfying. We thank them.”

Indeed, “Haute Taille”’s economic benefits in recent years have been at the top among all enterprises in Burundi and have exceeded the profit level of similarly scaled and equipped textile enterprises in China. Without the joint efforts of both sides of Sino-Burundian cooperation, this would not have been possible.

The achievements of “Haute Taille” have received high praise from Burundi’s leaders, who call it a model of South-South cooperation and urge the nation to learn from it. During the factory tour, a worker told the reporter that everyone is willing to work at “Haute Taille,” and the enthusiasm for labor is high.

After leaving “Haute Taille,” what remains in my mind is the bustling and prosperous scene of the factory. It can be believed that under the joint cultivation of both sides of Sino-Burundian cooperation, the flower of Sino-Burundian cooperation, “Haute Taille,” will bloom even more beautifully!

### 中布友好合作的结晶——访布琼布拉联合纺织厂

　　中布友好合作的结晶
    ——访布琼布拉联合纺织厂
    新华社记者  刘上阳
    “您去‘高台布’吗？”当我走出布琼布拉国际机场大楼时，一位出租汽车司机把我这位记者当作“高台布”中国专家，迎上前来拉生意，并竖起大拇指说：“‘高台布’好，是这样的！”
    原来“高台布”就是中国援建的布琼布拉联合纺织厂的法文缩写名，在布隆迪，这一名称几乎已家喻户晓。它是中布合作的一个很成功的项目。当地人称赞说：有了“高台布”，布隆迪从此结束了进口棉布的历史；“高台布”以其盈利多、经济效益好而为布隆迪国营企业树立了一面旗帜；“高台布”的产品饮誉国内外，为布隆迪赢得了殊荣。于是，我推迟其他采访任务，首先来到“高台布”参观。
    “高台布”位于布琼布拉东北部广阔的平原上，３５０００多平方米的厂房排列有序，拥有纺纱、织布、印染和机动四大车间，现有职工１７００名，是布隆迪最大的国营企业。该厂于１９８０年竣工移交布方后，仍一直与中方进行技术合作。工厂总经理让·卡布拉和由安徽省派出的中方技术组组长孙大祥向记者介绍说，自１９８６年起，该厂生产的坯布已连续３次获得马德里纺织品与服装国际博览会的金质奖。
    “高台布”于１９８０年投产，直到１９８２年第四季度才开始盈利。１９８６年以来年盈利四百多万美元。工厂年产量早已达到设计能力。如今的“高台布”在布隆迪的国民经济中已起着不可忽视的作用。“高台布”生产出高质量的替代进口产品，特别是印花布品种达到了１７００种，既满足了全国妇女穿衣的需要，使布隆迪不再进口棉布，从而为国家节省了大量外汇；而且，该厂从１９８６年起开始出口部分产品，为国家赚取了外汇。布隆迪是个产棉国，年产量约四千吨，过去棉花全部用于出口，因而受制于国际市场。如今“高台布”能吃掉绝大部分国产棉，从而解决了国产棉的销路问题。人口密度名列非洲第二的布隆迪，失业问题相当严重，“高台布”的建成，解决了一大批人的失业问题。
    “高台布”目前在银行已有几千万美元的存款，为解决供求矛盾，工厂正在准备扩建。最近，中布双方已就由工厂自身提供资金、由中方承担扩建工程和提供一万纱锭的设备达成了协议，将于今年动工。
    卡布拉在介绍中指出，“中国专家工作质量高，非常令人满意，我们感谢他们。”
    的确，“高台布”近几年的经济效益能居布隆迪全国各企业之冠，并超过了中国国内同样规模和设备水平的纺织企业的盈利水平，如果没有中布双方的通力合作，是难以做到的。
    “高台布”取得的成就，受到了布隆迪领导人的高度赞扬，称之为南南合作的典范，并号召全国人民学习它。在车间里参观时，一位工人告诉记者说，大家都乐意在“高台布”工作，劳动热情高昂。
    离开“高台布”后，留在我脑海中的是该厂一幅繁忙兴旺的景象。可以相信，在中布双方的共同培育下，“高台布”这朵中布合作之花必将开得更加鲜艳！
