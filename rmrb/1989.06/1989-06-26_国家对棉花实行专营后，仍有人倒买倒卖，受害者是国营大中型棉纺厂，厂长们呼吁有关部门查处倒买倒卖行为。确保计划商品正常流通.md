A state-owned cotton mill in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, recently received a telegram: "1,000 tons of 129-grade cotton from Henan, priced at 8,900 yuan per ton, delivered to Lianyungang, with a transit permit, reply to Shenzhen 2711, Xie Sai'er."

Who is this Xie Sai'er? Since last year, the State Council has repeatedly emphasized that cotton is a planned commodity under state management, to be exclusively handled by supply and marketing cooperatives. Other departments and individuals are not allowed to intervene. Yet, Xie Sai'er possesses a large amount of high-quality cotton and can deliver it directly to Lianyungang. Surprisingly, the transit permit, which is only issued by the cotton monopoly department to those who purchase cotton according to state plans, is in his hands, allowing him to sell large quantities of cotton without hindrance.

The price quoted in the telegram is shocking. It is more than double the state-regulated price of over 4,000 yuan per ton. If the deal goes through, this single transaction would allow the cotton speculator or some other company in Shenzhen to make a profit of hundreds of millions of yuan.

This is one of the strange phenomena currently plaguing China's textile industry.

To uncover the mystery, the reporter visited several state-owned cotton mills in major cities. The factory directors mostly spoke of the many difficulties their factories face but avoided discussing issues related to the procurement and supply of raw cotton. The procurement personnel hesitantly told me, "We buy cotton from the monopoly units in the producing areas according to the state allocation plan. First, we have to entertain and give gifts. A few months ago, we had to pay in advance, and we had to beg and plead, almost to the point of kowtowing. Even so, the cotton we bought is less than half of the planned allocation."

The reporter learned from various relevant parties that the current sources of cotton for "speculators" mainly come from two channels. One is that certain units engaged in cotton operations use their authority for personal gain, secretly retaining part of the purchased cotton to sell to cotton dealers and "connected parties." The cotton dealers then resell it at a higher price. Such cases often involve collusion, with "openly repairing the bridge while secretly crossing the river." The fact that the Shenzhen-based Xie Sai'er has so much cotton and holds a transit permit is obviously not possible without the support of certain monopoly departments.

The other source of cotton for speculators is the illegal purchase of cotton from farmers in cotton-producing areas at prices higher than the state-regulated rates. According to statistics from relevant departments in Hebei Province, there are still over 35 million kilograms of cotton in the hands of farmers. Farmers are reluctant to sell their cotton for several reasons: some procurement departments lack cash, issuing IOUs is common, and farmers fear they won't get paid in cash; some farmers find the state's procurement price too low and, after fulfilling their quota, store the remaining cotton, waiting for a better price. As a result, the cotton market is closed, and the black market thrives. Many peddlers go from village to village, buying cotton from farmers, then selling it to larger dealers. After several transactions, the price skyrockets, and when it reaches the textile mills in the cities, it becomes exorbitantly high, making many state-owned textile mills reluctant to buy.

Currently, cotton also flows into many small cotton mills. These small mills generally have outdated and inefficient machinery, high raw material consumption, and poor product quality. The root cause of this abnormal situation is that, after implementing the financial decentralization and leadership term target responsibility system, local officials in cotton-producing areas, driven by local interests, intercept cotton for their own mills. These small textile mills produce low-quality cotton yarn using low-priced raw materials, which they sell at high prices to large and medium-sized knitting and weaving mills struggling to survive, and even to foreign trade departments. Because the products of knitting and weaving mills can be sold at high prices, with prices fluctuating with the market, the prices of knitted and woven products on the market keep rising like a snowball, resulting in large textile mills suffering losses, small mills benefiting, and consumers and the state being harmed. The reporter learned from relevant departments that out of the 1,204 state-owned textile enterprises nationwide, the comparable cost of products for the first five months of this year increased by 20.67%, profits decreased by 9.51%, and 124 enterprises incurred losses, with the loss amount increasing by 1.8 times compared to the same period last year.

On one hand, cotton supply is severely short, and on the other hand, there is cotton but it is too expensive to buy, this abnormal phenomenon is troubling state-owned cotton mills. This year, the state plans to supply the textile industry with cotton equivalent to only 70% of the annual production needs, and in reality, a considerable part of this allocation cannot be fulfilled. By the end of April this year, Shanghai had only purchased 55% of the planned cotton, and Beijing had only purchased 56% of the planned amount for the same period. Some large textile mills have already exhausted their reasonable inventory, producing as they receive raw materials, with some relying on processing materials from suppliers to barely maintain production. The abnormal production of cotton mills, the lack of yarn supply, and the forced shutdown or reduced production of some weaving, knitting, and cotton product mills have led to a comprehensive decline in the production and economic benefits of the textile industry, making it difficult to fulfill export contracts. Since April, although the downward trend has been reversed and production has begun to recover, out of the 10 major product categories, the number of products completing the production plan has increased from two in January and February to five, but half of the products have not completed the monthly progress plan, and 75% of the products have a lower output than the same period last year.

The state has implemented monopolistic management of cotton, but the chaotic situation in the cotton circulation field has not been fundamentally resolved. In January this year, the State Price Bureau and the State Technical Supervision Bureau jointly issued the implementation measures for the punishment of price violations in cotton trading, but the effect has been limited. Multiple parties are involved, and the number of speculators buying and reselling at inflated prices is increasing. The directors of state-owned cotton textile enterprises appeal to relevant departments to investigate the misuse of monopolistic power for personal gain and resolutely solve this problem, ensuring the normal circulation of state-planned commodities.

　　国家对棉花实行专营后，仍有人倒买倒卖，受害者是国营大中型棉纺厂，厂长们呼吁有关部门查处倒买倒卖行为。     
    确保计划商品正常流通
    本报记者  李茜
    江苏省常州市一家国营棉纺厂，不久前接到一份电报：“河南产１２９（一级棉花，纤维长为２９毫米）棉花１０００吨，每吨价８９００元，连云港交货，有放行证，回电深圳２７１１，谢赛儿。”
    这个谢赛儿是何许人？去年以来国务院三令五申，棉花属国家计划管理商品，统一归供销社经营，其他部门和个人不得插手。而谢赛儿却拥有大量优质棉花，可以直运连云港交货。令人吃惊的是，放行证是只有按国家计划购买的棉花，才能从专营棉花部门拿到，而他却持有放行证，倒卖大量棉花可以畅通无阻。
    电报上开出的售价是吓人的，它比国家规定的每吨４０００多元高出一倍多。如果成交，仅此一笔交易，这位深圳的棉花倒卖者或者别的什么公司，即可获利数百万元。
    这就是目前困扰着我国纺织业的一个怪影。
    为了探寻其中的奥秘，记者访问了一些大城市的国营棉纺织厂。厂长们大都诉说了工厂面临的许多困难，却避而不谈涉及原棉采购、供应等方面的内情。采购人员吞吞吐吐对我说，我们按国家分配计划到产地的专营单位买棉花，先要请客送礼，几个月前就预付款，还得求爷爷，告奶奶，就差给人家磕头了，就这样买进的棉花还不到计划分配数的一半。
    记者从各有关方面了解到，目前棉花“倒爷”们的货源主要来自两条渠道。一条是某些经营棉花的单位以权谋私，把收购的棉花私自留出一部分卖给棉花贩子和“关系户”，棉花贩子再转手抬价倒卖。这类事有的是互相勾结，“明修栈道，暗渡陈仓”。那个深圳的谢赛儿手中这么多棉花，并持有放行证，显然，没有某些专营部门的支持是办不到的。
    棉花倒爷们的另一个货源，是以高于国家规定的价格，从棉产区农户中非法收购的。据河北省有关部门统计，目前全省尚有３５００多万公斤棉花存在农民手中。农民储棉不售的原因是，有些收购部门现金不足，打白条子的事时有发生，农民怕卖掉棉花拿不到现钱；有的农民嫌国家的收购价低，完成定购任务后把余下的棉花存起来，等待卖个好价钱。结果棉花市场关闭了，“黑市”趁机兴旺起来，许多小贩每天走村串乡，从农民手中收购棉花，然后卖给大商贩，几经倒手，层层加码，卖到城市的纺织厂，价格高得惊人，许多国营纺织厂不敢问津。
    目前，棉花还有一个流向，就是流进了许多小棉纺厂。这些小厂的机器设备一般都比较陈旧，技术落后，原料消耗很高，产品质量很低。导致这种不正常情况的原因是，实行财政分灶吃饭和领导任期目标责任制后，产棉区的地、县、乡干部从本地的利益出发，把棉花截留给自己办的纺织厂。这些小纺织厂用低价原料生产的棉纱质量虽差，却可以高价出售给在饥饿中挣扎的大中型针织厂、棉织厂，甚至外贸部门。由于针织厂、棉织厂的产品可以高进高出，价格随行就市，市场上销售的针棉织品价格就像滚雪球一般，不断加码，结果是苦了大棉纺织厂，肥了小厂，坑害了消费者和国家。记者从有关部门获悉，全国１２０４家国营纺织企业，今年头５个月可比产品成本上升２０．６７％，利润下降９．５１％，亏损企业１２４户，亏损额比去年同期上升１．８倍。
    一方面棉花供应严重短缺，一方面有棉花却因价格过高而买不起，这个畸形现象困扰着国营棉纺厂。今年国家计划供应纺织工业棉花，只相当于全年生产所需要的７０％，而实际上这个分配指标有相当一部分不能兑现。上海今年到４月底购进的计划内棉花，只有应分配数量的５５％，北京只购到同期分配计划的５６％。一些大型纺织厂早已把合理库存吃光，原料进一点生产一点，有的靠来料加工勉强维持生产。棉纺厂生产不正常，无纱可供，有的织布厂、针织厂、棉制品厂也被迫停产或减产，从而导致纺织工业的生产、经济效益全面滑坡，出口合同无法履约。今年４月份以来，滑坡现象虽有所扭转，生产开始回升，在１０大类主要产品中，完成生产计划的由一二月份的两种增加到５种，但仍有半数产品未能完成月进度计划，７５％产品产量低于去年同期水平。
    国家实行了棉花专营，但棉花流通领域里的混乱问题并未得到根本解决。今年１月间，国家物价局、国家技术监督局联合发布了棉花购销经营中价格违法行为的处罚实施办法，收效不大，多方插手，抬价收购，转手倒卖者有增无减。国营棉纺织企业的厂长们呼吁有关部门，查一查借专营以谋私，下决心解决这个难题，确保国家计划管理商品的正常流通。
