After the hard work of cadres and the masses, the summer grain harvest in China has been basically completed. According to the latest information provided by the Ministry of Agriculture, this year's summer grain production is expected to increase by about 3 billion kilograms compared to last year, surpassing the historical high of 93.25 billion kilograms in 1986.

This year's wheat harvest was successful due to several factors. Firstly, the autumn sowing area expanded. Secondly, local leadership departments paid great attention to agriculture, implementing various policies in a solid manner. The supply of agricultural materials was also more timely and sufficient compared to previous years. Additionally, scientific management of wheat fields was strengthened, and efforts were made to increase investment in agriculture. Agricultural water conservancy projects were also better than in previous years, especially in key wheat-producing areas where the irrigated area increased significantly. Furthermore, the climate was favorable after wheat sowing, with appropriate and timely rainfall, providing good natural conditions for wheat growth. This year, after the spring, various places seized key moments to timely apply fertilizer, plow, irrigate, and carry out large-scale field management activities. Due to the combined efforts of all levels, careful management, and high-quality care, this year's summer grain yield also reached a relatively good historical level. According to estimates from agricultural departments, the national average number of ears per mu has increased by 10,000 to 30,000 ears compared to last year, with each mu potentially increasing production by 5 to 15 kilograms.

From the current harvest situation in various places, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Sichuan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Beijing have all seen increased production, with Henan, Shaanxi, and Beijing seeing significant increases this year.

Experts remind that the weather has been good recently, and all places must seize this opportunity to hurry up with threshing and drying, striving to prevent spoilage and ensure that every grain is stored.

　　夏粮增产３０亿公斤超过历史最高水平    
    专家提醒各地抢打抢晒力争不霉不烂
    新华社北京６月２０日电（记者蒲立业）经过广大干部群众紧张奋战，我国夏粮已基本抢收完毕。根据农业部提供的最新情况，今年我国夏粮总产可望比去年增产３０亿公斤左右，超过历史上最好的１９８６年９３２．５亿公斤的水平。
    今年小麦丰收，除了去年秋播种面积扩大的因素外，主要是各地领导部门普遍重视农业，扎扎实实地落实了各项政策；各项农用物资供应也比以往及时，比较充足；同时加强了对麦田的科学管理；千方百计增加了对农业的投入；农田水利建设也搞得比往年好，特别是一些重点产麦区，水浇地面积增加了许多。加上小麦播种后，大部分地区气候适宜，雨量适中且及时，使小麦生长有了一个良好的自然条件。今年开春后，各地又抓住各个关键时刻，及时追肥、耕耙、浇水，开展了大规模的田间管理活动。由于上下努力，管护精心，今年夏粮单产也夺得了历史较好水平。据农业部门估计，全国平均亩成穗比去年提高１万至３万穗，每亩可增产５至１５公斤。
    从目前各地收获情况看，河南、河北、山东、四川、山西、陕西、甘肃、北京等省市普遍增产，其中河南、陕西、北京等地今年增产幅度较大。
    有关专家提醒说，最近一段天气较好，各地务必抓住这一有利时机，抓紧抢打抢晒，力争不霉不烂，颗粒归仓。
