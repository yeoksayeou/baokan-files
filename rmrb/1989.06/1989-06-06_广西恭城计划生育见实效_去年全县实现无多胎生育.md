	Gongcheng County in Guangxi, predominantly inhabited by the Yao and Zhuang ethnic minorities, has achieved remarkable results in family planning after more than two years of painstaking propaganda and guidance. The county's population control efforts have reached an unprecedented level of success. According to accurate statistics, the birth rate in 1988 was reduced to 10.5‰, and the natural growth rate was reduced to 5.3‰, effectively eliminating multiple births across the county. Recently, a responsible official from the State Family Planning Commission visited the county to inspect the work and concluded that Gongcheng's family planning efforts have reached an advanced level nationwide.

	Gongcheng County is located in northern Guangxi and is one of the famous "old, minority, border, mountainous, and poor" counties in the region. In the past, due to an emphasis on the unique characteristics of ethnic minorities and mountainous areas, family planning work was not given sufficient attention. Since the spring of 1987, the new county committee and government leadership have established a strong population consciousness and a "per capita" concept, treating family planning as part of poverty alleviation in mountainous areas. By controlling the population, they aim to achieve the goal of poverty alleviation and prosperity. They organized over 1,500 county, township, and village cadres to go door-to-door in rural areas, propagating family planning policies and scientific knowledge, thereby providing the masses with the necessary ideological preparation for widespread implementation of family planning.

	While conducting extensive ideological guidance for the masses, the county implemented a family planning contract system at all levels of leadership. These measures have helped the masses understand the importance of family planning, and the cadres have become more enthusiastic, leading to a sustained family planning movement in both urban and rural areas. The masses have changed their previous attitude of "being told to practice family planning" to "wanting to practice family planning."

　　广西恭城计划生育见实效
    去年全县实现无多胎生育
    本报讯  以瑶、壮等少数民族为主体的广西壮族自治区恭城县，经过两年多艰苦细致的宣传引导工作，使党和国家的计划生育政策在此深入人心，全县人口控制工作出现一个前所未有的好成绩。据准确统计，该县１９８８年人口出生率降至１０．５‰，自然增长率降至５．３‰，全县基本实现了无多胎生育。最近国家计划生育委员会负责人到该县考察工作，认为该县计划生育工作已达到了全国先进水平。
    恭城县地处桂北，是广西有名的“老少边山穷”县之一。过去，由于强调少数民族和山区特点，对计生工作抓得不紧。自１９８７年春以来，新的一届县委和县政府领导树立起较强的人口意识和“人均”观念，把计划生育工作作为山区扶贫的内容之一，通过控制人口来达到脱贫致富的目的。他们组织１５００多名县乡村干部到农村挨家挨户宣传计划生育政策和计划生育的科学知识，为群众广泛实现计划生育提供了思想准备。
    在对群众做大量思想引导工作的同时，该县在各级领导中层层推行计划生育承包制。采取这些措施，群众思想通了，干部劲头大了，从而该县城乡出现了一个经久不衰的计划生育热潮。广大群众一改过去“要我计划生育”的状况，代之的是“我要计划生育”。
