Where there is dissatisfaction, there are complaints; where there are complaints, there are folk rhymes. Sometimes, in certain places or on certain issues, folk rhymes can become popular. This reflects, to some extent, the public's urgent desire to overcome social ills. For example, some people are dissatisfied with the extravagant banquets, so they have rhymes like, “‘Four dishes and one soup,’ fooling the central authorities,” and “Raise the wine cup, policies relax; pick up the chopsticks, it’s all good.” For the lazy and irresponsible bureaucratic style, there are rhymes like, “Morning flying around the county, noon holding a wine cup, afternoon sleeping soundly, evening ‘drawing turtles’ (playing cards),” “A cup of tea and a cigarette, a newspaper to pass the day, incoming documents get a circle, real issues not touched,” “Playing cards all night, drinking eight ounces without getting drunk, dancing any step, agreeing with whatever the leader says.” For the customs of gift-giving, bribery, and other unethical practices, there are rhymes like, “Being good at doing is not as good as being good at talking, being good at talking is not as good as being good at flattering, being good at flattering is not as good as being good at giving, being good at giving is not as good as being good at taking,” “To find truth, go to the radio station, to find an honest official, go to the theater, to get promoted, find a backer, to go through the back door, find Maotai,” “The rich are speculators, the poor are law-abiding, the promoted are flatterers, the rewarded are cheaters.” For dissatisfaction with certain personnel arrangements, there are rhymes like, “In-laws’ office, husband and wife’s department, nephew fetches water for the uncle to drink, grandson drives, grandfather rides,” “If they say you’re good, you’re good, if they say you’re not, you’re not, disagreeing is not allowed.” For dissatisfaction with certain departments that have policies from above but countermeasures from below, there are rhymes like, “When encountering a green light, hurry up and go, when encountering a yellow light, rush ahead, when encountering a red light, go around, when there’s no light, feel your way.”

Some people praise these folk rhymes, while others disregard them, finding them very annoying. I believe that blindly praising or criticizing folk rhymes, saying they are all good or all bad, is not quite appropriate. The proliferation of folk rhymes indicates open channels for expression, which is actually a sign of the maturation of democracy and freedom. We should carefully analyze and treat the dissatisfaction and complaints reflected in folk rhymes. Our Party and government should find the causes of public dissatisfaction from these rhymes and strive to change the problems that make the public unhappy.

For folk rhymes that reflect some incorrect and unhealthy sentiments, we should be even more cautious, paying attention to analysis and research, drawing lessons from the negative aspects, providing correct guidance, and turning negative factors into positive ones.

　　“顺口溜”中听民意
    河北承德军分区政治部  梁文俊
    有不满，便有牢骚；有牢骚，随着出现一套套的顺口溜。有时，在有些地方或有些问题上，顺口溜也会走红。这从一个侧面反映了群众对克服社会不良现象的迫切心情。比如：一些群众对吃喝风不满，便有“‘四菜一汤’，糊弄中央”、“酒杯一端，政策放宽；筷子一提，可以可以”。对闲散逍遥，不负责任的官僚作风不满，便有“上午满乡飞，中午端酒杯，下午呼呼睡，晚上‘画乌龟’（打扑克）”、“一杯香茶一支烟，一张报纸混半天，来了文件画个圈，实际问题不沾边”、“打牌一宿不睡，喝酒八两不醉，跳舞什么步都会，领导说什么都对”。对请客送礼，行贿受贿等不正之风不满，便有“会做不如会说，会说不如会拍，会拍不如会塞，会塞不如会要”、“要真理找电台，要清官找戏台，要升官找后台，走后门找茅台”、“富了投机倒把的，苦了奉公守法的，提了溜须拍马的，奖了弄虚作假的”。对有些人事安排不满，便有“亲家局，夫妻科，外甥打水舅舅喝，孙子开车爷爷坐”、“说你行你就行不行也行，说不行就不行行也不行，不服不行”。对于某些部门搞上有政策，下有对策不满，便有“遇到绿灯赶快走，遇到黄灯抢先走，遇到红灯绕着走，没有灯光摸着走”。
    对于各种各样的顺口溜，有人叫好，有人不屑一顾，甚为恼火。我认为，对于顺口溜，盲目地褒之贬之，说它一概都好或一概都坏，恐怕都不大得当。顺口溜多起来，说明言路畅通，实际上是民主和自由走向成熟的标志。对于以顺口溜形式反映群众的不满和牢骚，我们应该有分析的慎重对待才对。我们党和政府应该从顺口溜中找出群众不满的原因，然后尽力去改变那些令群众不满的问题。
    对于反映了某些不正确、不健康情绪的顺口溜，则更应持慎重态度，注意分析研究，从反面悟出一些道理，加以正确引导，化消极因素为积极因素。
