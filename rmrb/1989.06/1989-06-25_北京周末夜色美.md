The third weekend after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing arrived on June 24, 1989. At 6:30 PM, Beijing Television broadcast the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, announcing that Comrade Jiang Zemin would serve as the General Secretary and removing Comrade Zhao Ziyang from all his positions in the Central Committee. This was a piece of news that people had been eagerly awaiting.

As night fell, the high temperatures that had persisted for five days were somewhat alleviated by a gentle breeze. After a day's work, Beijing residents flocked out of their homes to enjoy the cool evening air. At Xibianmen, the reporter saw some "old Beijingers" playing poker in the park, while in the park near Xuanwumen, people were singing Peking opera, creating a peaceful scene. The reporter also saw residents of courtyard houses enjoying the cool air, chatting, and eating watermelons. This year is a bumper year for watermelons in Beijing, with the Beijing Fruit Company reporting that 600 million kilograms of watermelons were on the market this weekend alone.

At the Daxia Film Theater on Mishi Street, the reporter found that they had resumed night screenings for the first time since the rebellion. Starting at 10 PM, they continuously showed five films, including "The Capture of the Demons," "Secret Mission to the Golden Triangle," and "The Mystery Within the Mystery," three of which were premiering in Beijing. A driver from the Guizhou Provincial Office in Beijing, after buying two tickets for the night show, told the reporter, "It's been a long time since I last watched a night movie. Tonight, I'm going to enjoy it." Before this, the multi-functional film theater had already resumed activities such as video screenings, dance parties, billiards, and electronic games. Information from relevant municipal departments indicated that more than 50 cinemas, over 80 dance halls, more than 200 billiard rooms, nearly 200 video screening points, and more than 10 music tea houses across the city had all resumed operations in the past few days. Large swimming venues such as Yuanyuan Lake, Taoranting, Longtan Lake, and Qingnian Lake have been open to the public since June 10, with the number of visitors increasing daily.

After 10 PM, the reporter arrived at the Fuxingmen Overpass, where everything appeared orderly and tranquil. People enjoying the cool air had not yet dispersed. Some elderly people and women sat by the bridge chatting, a few children were riding bikes and playing on the open space by the bridge, and couples were enjoying each other's company. A retired female cadre from the Chinese Revolutionary History Museum told the reporter that she had been walking or enjoying the cool air here for several nights in a row. She said, "More and more people are coming out these nights, and everyone seems more relaxed. There's nothing to worry about." She pointed to the soldiers on duty on the overpass and said, "They are all so young and hardworking, truly lovable." The reporter chatted with a few soldiers on duty, and one of them from Shandong said, "Seeing the citizens enjoying themselves makes us happy, but it also reminds us of our heavy duty to maintain order."

Beijing's night markets have fully resumed operations, providing another good place for people to enjoy the summer weekends.

A relevant official from the Beijing Municipal Government told the reporter that many units are preparing to hold some distinctive summer activities to enrich people's cultural and entertainment lives and help eliminate the psychological barriers caused by the rebellion.

　　北京周末夜色美
    新华社记者  刘浦泉  王坚
    １９８９年６月２４日，是北京平息反革命暴乱后的第三个周末。
    晚６时３０分，北京电视台播出了中国共产党十三届四中全会公报，宣布江泽民同志任总书记，撤销了赵紫阳同志在中央的一切任职。这是人们等待已久的一个消息。
    入夜，持续了５天的高温气候，被一股习习凉风减退了一些。工作了一天的北京市民纷纷走出家门，涌向街头纳凉。记者在西便门看到一些“老北京”在街心花园玩扑克，在宣武门街头公园有人唱京戏，一派和平景象。记者还看到住在四合院里的人们一边乘凉、聊天，一边吃着西瓜。今年是北京的西瓜丰收年，市果品公司统计这个周末一天就有６００万公斤西瓜上市。
    在米市大街的大华电影院，记者发现他们暴乱以后第一个恢复了夜场电影，从晚上１０点开始连续放映了《智擒群魔》、《秘闯金三角》、《谜中之谜》等５部影片，其中３部是在京首次上映。贵州省驻京办事处的一位司机买到两张夜场电影票后对记者说：“好久没看夜场电影了，今晚出来过个瘾。”在此之前，这家多功能电影院已经恢复了录相、舞会、台球、电子游艺等项娱乐活动。市有关方面提供的情况表明，全市５０多家电影院、８０多家舞厅、２００多家台球、１９０多家录相放映点，以及１０多家音乐茶座等近几天都已陆续恢复营业。玉渊潭、陶然亭、龙潭湖、青年湖等十几家大型游泳场所也从１０日开始向社会开放，接待人次与日俱增。
    晚上１０点过后，记者来到复兴门立交桥，一切显得有序而宁静。乘凉的人们仍未散去，一些老人、妇女坐在桥边聊天，几个儿童在桥旁的空地上骑车追逐戏玩，还有一对对情侣在谈情说爱。中国革命历史博物馆的一位离休女干部连着几个晚上都在这儿散步或乘凉，她告诉记者，这几天晚上出来的人越来越多了，心情也显得越来越轻松，没有什么不放心的。她指着在立交桥上值勤的战士说：“他们一个个都很年轻，也很辛苦，真可爱。”记者同几位值勤的战士交谈了几句，其中的一位山东籍战士说：“市民们过得轻松愉快，我们感到高兴，但同时感到肩负的戒严任务更重了。”
    北京的夜市已全部恢复营业，为周末消夏的人们提供了又一个好的去处。
    北京市有关部门负责人告诉记者，不少单位正筹备举办一些富有特色的消夏活动，以丰富人们的业余文化娱乐生活，帮助消除因暴乱而产生的心理障碍。
