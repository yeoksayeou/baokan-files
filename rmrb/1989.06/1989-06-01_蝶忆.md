	Butterfly Memories
	Sun Weidong

	It was a small incident that happened in spring. At that time, I was still studying at the regional party school. In April, the flowers had already bloomed and faded. In one evening, I went for a walk with two companions. Perhaps it was because it had rained a little earlier, the weather was cooler than usual. We chatted and laughed as we walked through the waist-high wheat. At that time, the wheat stalks and ears still held rainwater, which soaked our hands, giving a sticky, heavy feeling. I looked down at my hands and suddenly saw a butterfly resting on a blade of grass. It had snow-white wings and a red back, and it was very beautiful. My hand was already brushing against its wings, but it remained unmoved. I gently tapped it, and it still didn't move. I then realized that the little butterfly was also competing for the spring light, but it was too fragile and couldn't withstand the chill after the rain, so it had "drunk" in the spring light...

	I felt a surge of sympathy and quickly squatted down to cup the little butterfly in my palm, gently blowing warm breath on it. My two companions turned back and saw my unusual behavior, laughing loudly. Soon, the little butterfly woke up from its spring dream. Its sticky wings had opened, thin as silk but flexible, and its two antennae began to spin. "Ah, it's alive," I exclaimed, as if I had done something great. My two companions were still deeply engrossed in their conversation, "What's alive?" "The butterfly!" "Oh—" They both drew out a long sound, as if they finally understood the reason for my silence. Then they both laughed loudly again. I didn't pay any more attention to them. I thought I should let the little butterfly return to nature as soon as possible, "to be in its proper place." So I threw it into the air with force. The little butterfly, not yet accustomed to the friction of the air, fell straight down at first, then spread its wings and fluttered away...

	I let out a long sigh.

	My two companions couldn't stand my delay and had already walked far ahead. I ran to catch up with them. Unexpectedly, when they saw me, they stared and laughed loudly again. This time, I was really at a loss. "How deep your feelings are, look, you're leaning on its shoulder again." This nonsensical remark made me even more confused. I glanced at my shoulder, and I was stunned. Yes, it was the little butterfly from just now, with snow-white wings and a red back, no mistake. At this moment, it was resting on my shoulder, shaking its wings calmly and leisurely...

	This truly moved me. "Little butterfly, are you coming to thank me, or are you still asking me for protection?" The insect couldn't speak, and I couldn't know for sure. But if it was the former, then I was ashamed. The heart of compassion is something everyone has, and it's a small effort that anyone can make, so what's the big deal? Instead, I should thank this little creature for being so understanding and trusting me so much. But if it was the latter, I thought it was really unnecessary. After all, the world is full of spring light and vitality, everyone is pursuing and struggling. As for the temporary cold in one place, it's only natural and doesn't matter...

	Of course, the little butterfly finally flew away. The little butterfly flapped its wings and flew towards the distance, flying lightly and spiritedly, finally merging into the golden sunset, becoming a tiny point, glowing...

	I let out a long sigh.

　　蝶忆

    那是春天里的一件小事。那时，我还在地区党校学习。４月里芳菲已尽在一个黄昏，我同两个伙伴出外散步。许是才漏过几星雨的缘故，天气较往日凉。我们一边谈笑，一边揽了齐腰深的麦子。此时，麦的秆叶间、麦穗里都还积着雨露，漫浸手掌，有一种粘重感。我低头看自己的手掌，蓦地，见一株草上落着只蝴蝶，雪翅红背，漂亮极了。那时我的手已擦着它的翅膀，它却无动于衷，再轻轻弹一下，依然如故。我这才明白，小蝴蝶也是来竞争春光的，只是它们太脆弱了，竟经受不住雨后春凉，要“醉倒”在这春光里了……同情之心油然而生，我赶紧蹲下去，将小蝴蝶捧在手掌心，轻轻给它哈着气。两个伙伴回头见我反常的样子，叽叽笑个不止。不大功夫，小蝴蝶从春梦中醒来了，它的粘合的翅子已经张开，其薄如纱，可灵活扇动，两条触须也开始打旋儿。“啊，活了”，我像是做了件什么大事，脱口而出。两个伙伴正兴味浓郁地高谈着，“什么活了？”“蝴蝶呀！”“噢——”两人同时长长一声，似乎才明白我这半天沉默的原由，继而又一齐叽叽笑了。我再不去理会他们。我想，该尽早让小蝴蝶重归自然，“得其所哉”。于是我用力将它抛向空中，小蝴蝶一时尚不堪空气的摩擦，先是直直落下节子，才又张开翅膀，翩翩飞动起来……
    我长吁了一口气。
    两个伙伴耐不住我的磨蹭，已走出很远。我紧跑一阵追上他们。谁料，他俩一见我，又是死盯着我叽叽地笑。这回真让我有些不知所措。“感情好深呐，瞧，又靠上膀子呢。”这没头没脑的话更令我莫名其妙，无意中看一眼肩膀，呀，我呆住了。不错，是刚才那只小蝴蝶，雪翅红背，一点不错。此刻，它正安然落在我肩头，恬静而又悠闲的摇着翅子……这真令我动情了。“小蝴蝶，你是来作谢呢，还是继续来请求我保护呢。”虫不能言，我亦不得而知。但若是前者，则让我惭愧了，恻隐之心，人皆有之，举手之劳，人能为之，又何足道哉，倒是我该感谢这小生灵如此通情达性，对我又如此信任。而倘是后者呢，我想就大可不必了，要知道，这个世界毕竟是春光明媚，充满生机，人人在追求，人人在奋斗，至于一时一地的清寒既在情理之中，又算得什么呢……
    自然，小蝴蝶终于飞走了。小蝴蝶鼓起羽翼频频朝远方飞去，飞得轻盈、飞得精神，最后融入金色的晚霞里，成一个点点，泛着光……
