Thug Involved in the Mutilation of Li Guorui Arrested

Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 16th: The Martial Law Command Headquarters' Press Office reported: Meng Duo, who participated in the mutilation of the fallen soldier Li Guorui at the Fuchengmen Overpass, was arrested last night by the Beijing Xicheng District Public Security Bureau.

Yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, a Beijing resident who witnessed the incident reported to the Fuchengmen Branch of the Xicheng District Public Security Bureau that Meng Duo had participated in the mutilation of Li Guorui. After verifying the facts, the Xicheng Public Security Bureau, with the assistance of the Martial Law troops, arrested Meng Duo last night.

According to Meng Duo's confession: On the early morning of June 4th, Meng Duo was passing by the northeast side of the Fuchengmen Overpass when he saw a group of people beating a soldier with belts, shovel handles, and bicycle chains. The soldier was rolling on the ground. Meng Duo picked up a piece of wood and struck the soldier, cursing obscenities. The first blow hit the soldier's temple, the second hit the forehead, and the third hit the face. Seeing the soldier covered in blood with brain matter flowing out, Meng Duo dropped the wood and left hastily.

Meng Duo is 24 years old. He was previously detained for theft and served two years in a juvenile detention center and three years in re-education through labor. He was released in April this year.

    据孟多交待：６月４日凌晨，孟多路过阜成门立交桥东北侧附近，见一伙人用皮带、锹把、自行车链子毒打一名战士，战士在地上翻滚。孟多抓起一截木棒，向战士打去，边打边骂下流话。第一棒打在战士的太阳穴，第二棒打在脑门，第三棒打在面部，孟多见战士被打得满脸流血，脑浆外流，便丢下木棒扬长而去。
