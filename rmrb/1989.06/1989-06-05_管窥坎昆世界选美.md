A Glimpse into the Miss Universe Pageant in Cancun

People's Daily, Cancun, May 23rd

On the evening of May 23, 22-year-old Dutch model and beautician Angela Visser was crowned "Miss Universe 1989" in Cancun, Mexico. Angela herself was surprised by the outcome. Just a month earlier, when she arrived in Cancun with her fiancé, she realized that competing against 75 contestants from five continents would be a daunting task. To date, none of the 37 Miss Universe winners have been from the Netherlands. What would the outcome of this competition be?

The competition for the title of Miss Universe began the moment the 76 contestants arrived in Cancun. Apart from sightseeing, the participants mainly engaged in various rehearsals, aiming to score points in several group appearances, including performances in national costumes, swimsuits, and evening gowns. The host introduced each contestant's personal details, birthdate, characteristics, and hobbies to the judges and audience. From the introductions, it was clear that the contestants were all accomplished in their own fields. For example, the Canadian contestant was studying business management; the Colombian contestant was pursuing a medical degree with the goal of becoming an expert in AIDS prevention; the Guatemalan contestant was committed to child welfare; the Nigerian contestant was a lawyer; and there were others studying civil law, history, literature, and more. The contestants also had to individually converse with the judges, who evaluated each person's appearance, personality, and intelligence, recording their scores in a secret computer system. Based on these scores, along with the group appearances and semi-final scores, the top 10 contestants were selected. The judges included a female writer, a hairstyling expert, a fashion model designer, a sports star, a television producer, a singer, an actor, a publisher, and others. Although they claimed to score objectively and fairly, focusing on inner beauty, they also admitted that it was difficult to grasp global beauty standards. One of the judges, American writer Jacqueline Briskin, told the contestants, "For me, the most important thing is your inner beauty and character." Another judge, figure skating champion Rosalyn Summers, said, "Your appearance is just one part of you. I think the most important thing is how you consider and achieve success in your life." Some judges also believed that the contestants' attitudes towards family, marriage, and life views were important.

In this year's competition, none of the top 10 contestants were from the East. However, in the previous year's competition held in Taiwan, four Eastern contestants made it to the top 5, and the Miss Universe crown went to Thailand. Some people questioned the objectivity of the pageant. In reality, beauty, especially inner beauty, reflects the judges' ethical views and has a significant subjective element. After being crowned, Angela candidly admitted that she had not expected to win. Although she received $300,000 in prize money and the opportunity to travel around the world, for others, the importance lay in the national and racial honor. Some even believed that the crowning of the Dutch contestant would help promote the export of Dutch cheese. It is no surprise that some feminists criticized the pageant as the commodification of women's images.

To prepare for this pageant, the Mexican government invested in improving Cancun's satellite communication conditions, and private hotel groups invested in enhancing tourism facilities. The Mexican tourism authorities confidently believed that approximately 600 million people watched the Cancun pageant on television, learning about Cancun, which would become a potential source of massive tourism for Cancun.

　　管窥坎昆世界选美
    本报记者  郭伟成
    ５月２３日晚，２２岁的荷兰模特儿、美容师安吉拉·维塞尔在墨西哥坎昆被加冕为“１９８９年环球小姐”。安吉拉本人对此也感到吃惊。一个月前，当她与未婚夫一起到坎昆时，面对来自五大洲７５位各国与地区的小姐时，就意识到，这将是一场十分艰巨的角逐。迄今为止，在当选的３７位“环球小姐”中，还没有一位是荷兰人，这次竞争结果又会怎么样呢？
    对“环球小姐”的竞争，从７６名小姐到达坎昆的那一天就开始了。除了参观游览外，参加者主要进行各种排练，争取在几次集体亮相中“得分”，包括着民族服装、泳装、夜礼服的表演。主持者逐一向评委及观众介绍个人的情况、生辰、特征及爱好。从介绍来看，参赛者都是学有所长的。例如加拿大小姐在攻企业管理；哥伦比亚小姐正在医科大进修，立志成为防治艾滋病的专家；危地马拉小姐决心从事幼儿福利事业；尼日利亚小姐是位律师；还有攻读民法、历史、文学等等。参赛者还必须逐个与评审员谈话，由他们就每个人的外表、个性、智力打分，存入秘密的计算机里。在这基础上，加上亮相及半决赛的打分，筛选出前１０名。评审员中有女作家、发型专家、时装模特设计师、运动名将、电视制片人、歌唱家、演员、出版商等等。虽然他们表示要客观、公正地打分，多为内在美打分，但是也承认掌握全球观念的选美标准是很难的。这届评委、美国作家萨奎琳·布里斯金对小姐们说，“对我来说，最重要的是你们的内在美与人格。”评委、女子滑冰冠军罗莎琳·萨默也说，“你们的外表只是你们拥有的外衣，只是一部分。我认为，最重要的是你们怎么考虑以何种方式在人生道路上取胜。”有的评委认为参赛者对家庭、婚姻的态度及生活观念也很重要。
    在这次选美中列入前１０名的小姐中没有一位东方人。而去年在台湾举办的上届选美，有４名东方人进入前５名，“环球小姐”的桂冠亦属东方的泰国小姐。为此，也有人对选美的客观性表示怀疑。事实上，美不美，尤其所谓内在美，总是反映评委的伦理观念，有很大的主观随意性。安吉拉加冕后坦率地说，她事先并没有料到自己会获胜。虽然，她本人获奖３０万美元，并周游各国，但是，对其他人来说，重要的是国家与种族的殊荣。有人甚至还认为荷兰小姐的加冕，会有助于荷兰奶酪的出口。无怪乎有的女权主义者批评说，选美是妇女形象的商品化。
    为了这次选美，墨西哥政府投资改善了坎昆的卫星通讯条件，私人旅店集团投资改善了旅游设施。墨西哥旅游当局有信心地认为，大约有６亿人通过电视观看了坎昆选美，了解了坎昆，这将成为坎昆的潜在的巨大客源。
