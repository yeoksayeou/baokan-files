The Linghe Supply and Marketing Cooperative in Anqiu County, Shandong, has implemented a system where they first conduct trials and then supply pesticides to meet the needs of cotton, tobacco, and fruit farmers. They provide different pesticides according to the seasons and sell them in both bulk and small quantities. They also deliver the pesticides to the villages, making it convenient for the farmers and preventing the sale of counterfeit, substandard, and fake pesticides. This also prevents the resale of pesticides, which can harm farmers.

This is a scene of them delivering pesticides to the villages.

    凌河供销社方便农民买农药
    山东安丘县凌河供销社为满足方便棉农、烟农、果农的农药供应，实行先试验后供应，根据不同季节供应不同药品，并拆整卖零，送货下乡方便群众，杜绝和防止伪、劣、假冒农药和销售后转手倒卖者的坑农、害农活动。
    这是他们在下乡送药。
