    Eighteen senior veterans of the State Education Commission held a symposium and proposed to summarize experiences and educate the next generation. Li Tieying, accompanied by senior comrades, visited the capital's martial law troops.

    According to a report from our newspaper, on the morning of June 18, Li Tieying, a member of the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, State Councilor, and Minister of the State Education Commission, visited the garrison of a certain unit of the capital's martial law troops with 18 senior veterans who were former vice-ministerial level officials of the Ministry of Education. They looked after and comforted the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army who contributed to suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot.

    Yang Yuyu, former member of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission and former vice-minister of the Ministry of Education, expressed the gratitude of the senior veterans to the soldiers and officers of the martial law troops on behalf of the group. She said that under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, the People's Liberation Army, armed police, and public security officers had successfully crushed the counter-revolutionary riot. The Party, government, and people are grateful, and the people will never forget.

    Dong Chun Cai, former vice-minister of the Ministry of Education, former secretary of the Party group, and senior educator, excitedly recited a poem he dedicated to the soldiers and officers of the martial law troops, titled "Praise to the Heroic Army": The Long March raises heroic winds, subduing tigers in the nine realms of red, dispelling demons and clearing the mist, writing new deeds in history. As long as the heroic army is here, the mountains and rivers will be red for a hundred generations.

    Other senior comrades who visited the martial law troops included Zhang Chengxian, Yang Haibo, Guo Mingqiu, Zang Boping, Zhang Wensong, Huang Xinbai, and others. Vice Minister of the State Education Commission, Zhu Kaixuan, also participated in the visit.

    Finally, under the direction of Li Tieying, the more than 800 soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army present sang the song "Without the Communist Party, There Would Be No New China" together with the senior comrades. The visit concluded with resounding singing and enthusiastic applause.

    After the visit, Li Tieying had a discussion with these senior comrades. During the discussion, these senior comrades unanimously expressed their firm support for the wise decision of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission to suppress the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital, as well as for Deng Xiaoping's important speech. At the same time, they proposed to conduct a deep reflection, seriously summarize experiences and lessons, and strengthen ideological and political education. They emphasized the need to uphold the socialist educational front and educate the next generation well.
