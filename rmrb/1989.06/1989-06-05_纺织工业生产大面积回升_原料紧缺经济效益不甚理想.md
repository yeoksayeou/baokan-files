	The latest statistical data shows that the total industrial output value of the national textile industry from January to April accumulated to 4.2 billion yuan, an increase of 3.03% compared to the same period last year. Five products, including chemical fibers, yarn, printed fabrics, woolen yarn, and textile machinery, have completed their planned progress, thereby reversing the continuous decline in textile production since the beginning of the year.

	According to the June 5 issue of the "China Textile News," textile production experienced a significant decline in January and February, drawing the attention of local and higher-level leaders. Some local governments took emergency measures to support textile production in terms of energy and funds. Textile departments in various regions also strengthened the organization and coordination of production, reversing the declining trend. The daily production level of yarn has been increasing month by month, with a 7.8% increase in February compared to January, a 2.8% increase in March compared to February, and a 4.7% increase in April compared to March, basically restoring to the normal level of last year. The number of regions with declining total output value has decreased from 14 in January and February to 7. Despite this, the production of woolen fabrics, sackcloth, silk, and silk products has not completed the planned progress. Although yarn production has completed the planned progress, there are imbalances among provinces and cities. Cotton-producing provinces generally complete more than 35% of their annual plans, while cotton-importing provinces struggle with raw material shortages and perform relatively poorly. Tianjin and Shanghai have only completed 26.42% and 28.14% of their plans, respectively.

	Economic benefits are even more concerning. According to a survey of 33 large and medium-sized cities' state-owned textile industries, although profits in March and April have rebounded compared to January and February, the cumulative profit from January to April has decreased by 13.02% compared to the same period last year. The most indicative economic benefit indicator, the capital profit tax rate, has decreased by 7.14% compared to the same period last year. There are 124 loss-making enterprises, an increase of 44 compared to the same period last year; the loss amount is 64.58 million yuan, an increase of 1.8 times. Among the 33 large and medium-sized cities, 13 regions have seen an increase in profits and taxes compared to the same period last year, with Weifang, Xi'an, Shashi, and Shaanxi (directly affiliated) seeing increases of more than 20%. The remaining 20 regions have seen a decrease in profits and taxes compared to the same period last year.

	Additionally, the shortage of textile raw materials remains a major issue affecting textile production this year. Most regions have significant shortages and minimal inventory. Production can barely be maintained in the second quarter, but the situation in the third quarter will be more severe, potentially leading to production halts due to raw material supply disruptions. Relevant departments in various regions should make early preparations and not be complacent.

### 纺织工业生产大面积回升  原料紧缺经济效益不甚理想

　　纺织工业生产大面积回升
    原料紧缺经济效益不甚理想
    本报讯  最新统计资料表明：全国纺织工业总产值１—４月累计完成４２０亿元，比去年同期增长３．０３％，已有化纤、纱、印染布、毛线、纺织机械等５种产品完成了计划进度，从而使进入元月以来纺织生产持续滑坡局面开始扭转。
    据６月５日《中国纺织报》报道，今年１、２月份，纺织工业生产出现了大面积滑坡，引起了各地各级领导的重视。一些地方政府采取了紧急措施，从能源、资金等方面尽力支持纺织生产。各地纺织工业部门也加强了生产的组织协调工作，使生产滑坡的局面得到扭转。纱的日产水平逐月提高，２月比１月上升７．８％，３月比２月上升２．８％，４月比３月又上升４．７％，基本恢复到去年的正常水平。总产值下降的地区已由１、２月份的１４个减少到７个。尽管如此，呢绒、麻袋、丝、丝织品等的产量仍未完成计划进度。纱产量虽然完成了计划进度，但各省市不平衡，产棉省一般完成年计划的３５％以上，而棉花调入省则苦于原料短缺而完成较差，天津、上海仅完成２６．４２％和２８．１４％。
    经济效益更令人忧虑。从对３３个大中城市国营纺织工业调查的结果看，虽然３、４月份的利润比１、２月份有所回升，但１至４月利润累计比去年同期下降１３．０２％，最能反映经济效益的指标资金利税率比去年同期下降７．１４％。亏损企业达１２４户，比去年同期增加４４户；亏损额６４５８万元，增亏１．８倍。在３３个大中城市中，有１３个地区利税比去年同期增长，潍坊、西安、沙市、陕西（直属）等地增幅达２０％以上；其余２０个地区利税均比上年同期下降。
    另外，纺织原料短缺仍是困扰今年纺织生产的主要问题。多数地区缺口较大，库存很少，二季度尚能勉强维持生产，三季度形势将更加严峻，可能出现因原料供应脱节，造成停产的情况。各地有关部门要早做准备，不可掉以轻心。
