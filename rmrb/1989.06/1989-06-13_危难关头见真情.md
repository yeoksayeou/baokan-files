On June 4th, the Jinan Army Corps, tasked with maintaining martial law in the capital, entered the city to patrol. When they reached the Chongwen District, they were surrounded and attacked by thousands of uninformed civilians and a few rioters. Despite being armed, the soldiers maintained restraint and did not fire at the crowd. Several dozen officers and soldiers were injured and separated from their units. Just as the soldiers were worried about the safety of their comrades, they learned that these comrades had been protected by local residents. Upon returning to their units, the soldiers were deeply moved as they recounted their personal experiences.

	Certain Division's Organizational Staff Officer Wang Li, Lieutenant, said:

	I received careful treatment from the workers at Tian Tan Park.

	"On that morning, as we were marching into the Chongwen District near Tian Tan Park, a group of people shouted, 'They are going to Tiananmen to suppress the students, beat them up!' Immediately, stones and bricks rained down. I was hit on the head by a stone and passed out...

	"When I came to, I saw four people dragging me towards Tian Tan Park. I was anxious, thinking they were going to harm me. I tried to struggle but couldn't move and passed out again. When I woke up the second time, it was noon. I opened my eyes and saw that it was quiet around me. I found myself lying in the emergency room, with a nurse sitting beside me. I thought I was dreaming and tried to move, but the nurse gently held me down and signaled for me to stay still. She told me, 'You are now in the Tian Tan Park clinic, and you just had surgery.' From her, I learned that I had four stitches on my head and had been unconscious for half a day due to excessive bleeding. She also told me that the four park management staff had rescued me after seeing me beaten and bleeding on the ground, being insulted by a group of people. The Tian Tan Park clinic quickly called four surgeons from the Fourth People's Hospital of Chongwen District to perform the surgery on me.

	"Thanks to timely treatment and good care in the local hospital, I recovered quickly. Although the people of the capital did not understand our entry into the city to maintain martial law at first, when we were in danger, they stood up and cared for their own soldiers."

	Certain Division's Third Artillery Company's Fourth Platoon Leader Chen Gang, Sergeant, said:

	A university student from the China University of Political Science and Law protected me.

	"In the chaos, three of our soldiers were seriously injured, and I covered their retreat. Facing this chaotic scene, we didn't know where to retreat; at this time, there were still many attackers beating us. At this critical moment, a student wearing the emblem of the China University of Political Science and Law ran towards us and said, 'Follow me, I will protect you.' We followed him, somewhat skeptical, to a crossroad. This student stopped a truck and let us get on. He told the driver, 'Send these soldiers to the hospital, they are badly injured.' The driver, without a word, drove towards Longtan Hospital. When the car reached a crossroad, some people saw that the truck was carrying soldiers and immediately blocked the way, shouting that soldiers should not be treated. This student jumped off the car and explained to these people, and we were finally allowed to pass.

	"Arriving at Longtan Hospital, this student found the hospital director and doctors, explained the situation, and the hospital quickly treated us before he left the hospital with peace of mind.

	This student's name is Zhao Wei. He told us that many students do not support the rioting, and I believe he spoke from the heart."

	Certain Division's Bodyguard Wang Yi, Private, said:

	I will never forget the kindness of Beijing's kind-hearted citizens.

	"I never imagined that in this situation, Beijing citizens would have so much affection for the soldiers. If it weren't for that citizen hiding me in his home, I would have been killed.

	"That day, after we were dispersed, a group of people stripped me of my clothes, and I ran out of the crowd in my undershirt and shorts. A group of thugs chased after me, shouting, 'Catch that soldier, beat him to death!' I ran into an alley and hid, but they found me again. I ran again, and the thugs chased after me desperately. Just as I was at my wits' end, an old man heard the noise and came out of his house, pulling me into his home. The thugs asked him for me, and the old man shouted, 'This is my son, what do you want?' Seeing this, the group dispersed. After they left, the old man asked me, 'Are you a soldier?' I said, 'Yes.' He nodded and then gave me a set of civilian clothes to wear, telling me to stay in their home for the time being.

	"Since it was dark and I was unfamiliar with the area, I only remember that this old man lives in the Xuanwu District, but I must find a way to find this old man. I will never forget the kindness of Beijing's kind-hearted citizens towards the soldiers."

　　危难关头见真情
    章立品　韩瑞华
    ６月４日，担负首都戒严任务的济南部队某部奉命进入市区值勤，当他们进至崇文区地段时，遭到数千名不明真相群众的围观阻拦和少数暴徒的疯狂袭击。这支荷枪实弹的部队仍保持克制态度，没向人群开枪，有几十名干部战士被砸伤后失散。正当该部队官兵为这些同志的生命担忧的时候，这些同志都分别被当地的人民群众保护着。他们回部队后十分感动地叙述了自己的亲身经历。
    　　　　某部组织股干事王黎中尉说：
    　　在天坛公园，我得到了职工的悉心救护
    “那天清晨，当我们行进到崇文区天坛公园路口时，有一伙人喊：‘他们是去天安门镇压学生的，快打呀！’顿时，石头、砖块雨点般打来。我头部被一块石头打中，立即昏了过去……
    “当我醒来时，只见有四个人拖着我往天坛公园跑，我心中很急，以为他们要杀害我，我想挣扎又动不了，只好由他们拖，再次昏了过去。当我第二次醒过来时，已是中午时分，我睁眼一看，四周静悄悄的，发现自己躺在急救室内，身边坐着一名护士。我以为自己在做梦，拚命想动一动，这位护士小姐轻轻按住我，示意我不要动。她告诉我，‘你现在是在天坛公园卫生所，刚刚动了手术。’从她口中得知，我头部缝了四针，由于失血过多，已昏迷大半天。她还告诉我，抢救我的是天坛公园的四名管理人员，他们发现我被暴徒打倒在地，鲜血淋淋，受着一伙人的辱骂，把我给抢救了出来。天坛公园卫生所为了及时无误地给我治疗，立即打电话请来了崇文区第四人民医院的四名外科医生，为我动了手术。
    “由于治疗及时，在地方医院得到了很好的护理休养，我很快痊愈。尽管首都人民对我们进城戒严一时不理解，但当我们遭受危难时，他们又总是挺身而出，依然关怀爱护自己的子弟兵。”
    　　　　某部三炮连四班长陈刚上士说：
    　　政法大学一名大学生保护了我
    “在混乱中，我们班里的三名战士受了重伤，我掩护这三名战士后撤。面对这一混乱场面，我们并不知道撤到什么地方好；这时，仍有不少围攻者殴打我们。在这危急关头，一位佩带政法大学校徽的大学生向我们奔了过来，对我们说：‘跟我走，我保护你们’，我们将信将疑地跟他走到一个路口，这位大学生拦了一辆卡车让我们上去。他告诉司机：‘把这些解放军送到医院去，他们伤得很厉害。’司机二话没说，开车朝龙潭医院驶去。当车开到一个路口时，一些人见车上拉的是解放军，马上又阻拦起哄，高喊不能给当兵的治伤。这位大学生跳下车去向这些人作了许多解释，我们才被放了过去。
    “来到龙潭医院，这位大学生找到医院院长、医生，说明了情况。医院迅速为我们进行治疗后，他才放心地离开医院。
    这位大学生的名字叫赵伟。他对我们讲，许多大学生不赞成搞暴乱，我相信他说的是心里话。”
    　　　　某部警卫员王毅下士说：
    　　忘不了北京善良市民的恩情
    “我怎么也没想到，在这种情况下北京市民对子弟兵这么有感情。要不是那位市民把我藏在他家里，我早就没命了。
    “那一天，我们被打散以后，我被一伙人剥去了衣服，只穿着背心和短裤从人群里跑了出来。后面有一群歹徒还在追赶我，边追边喊：‘抓住这个当兵的，打死他！’我跑进一个胡同躲了起来，又被他们发现，我接着又跑，这伙歹徒在后面拚命地追。正当我走投无路时，一位老大爷闻声从屋里出来，把我拉进了他家。歹徒找他要人，老人大声说：‘这是我的儿子，你们想怎么样？’这帮人见状就散了回去。这些人走后，老大爷问我：‘你是当兵的吧？’我说：‘是。’他点了点头，随后拿了一套便装让我穿上，并叫我先在他们家住下。
    “由于当时天黑，对这里又不熟悉，我只记得这位老大爷住在宣武区一带，但我一定要想办法找到这位老人。我忘不了北京善良市民对子弟兵的恩情。”
