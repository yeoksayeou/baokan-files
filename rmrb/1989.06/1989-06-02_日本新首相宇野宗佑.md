On June 2, Takeshita Cabinet Foreign Minister Uno Sōsuke was elected as the new president of the Liberal Democratic Party; on the same day, he was nominated by the Diet to become the new prime minister and tasked with forming a cabinet.

Uno Sōsuke belongs to the Nakasone faction within the Liberal Democratic Party. He has held various positions within the party, including Chairman of the Diet Strategy Committee and Acting Secretary-General. In the government, he has served as the Director-General of the Defense Agency, Director-General of the Science and Technology Agency, Director-General of the Management and Coordination Agency, Minister of International Trade and Industry, and Minister of Foreign Affairs. Uno is the first politician in the history of Japan's governments to ascend to the throne of power without being a factional leader.

In 1922, Uno was born in the brewery family of Moriyama City, Shiga Prefecture. He attended Hikone Higher Commercial School and Kobe Commercial University. In 1945, when Japan surrendered, he was a junior accounting officer and was captured in northern Korea and sent to Siberia. He returned to Japan in 1947 and was elected as a prefectural assembly member in 1951. Later, he served as the secretary of the famous politician Kawano Ichirō. Since 1960, he has been elected to the House of Representatives nine times. The Japanese media believes that Uno is not a "money-politician" within the Liberal Democratic Party and has not been implicated in the Recruit scandal. On May 31, when he learned of his nomination as the next president of the Liberal Democratic Party, he was in Paris attending the annual meeting of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. He said that asking him to take the helm of the government was like a "bolt from the blue."

Uno is a versatile politician within the Liberal Democratic Party. He is skilled in painting, loves music, plays the harmonica, and often plays the piano. He is also a haiku poet, a local historian, and proficient in kendo. He speaks English, Russian, and Chinese. His wife, Chiyo, is related to the "Rikyu family" of the Japanese tea ceremony. Both of his daughters are married.

Uno has visited China several times and met with Chinese leaders. When he served as the foreign minister, he clearly stated that the past war between China and Japan was an aggressive war initiated by Japan.
