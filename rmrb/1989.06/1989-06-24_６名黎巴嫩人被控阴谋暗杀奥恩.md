Xinhua News Agency, Nicosia, June 22nd.

Six Lebanese citizens have been accused by a local court in Cyprus of participating in an assassination plot.

The six Lebanese Muslims admitted to planning to shoot down the aircraft of Lebanese Christian leader Aoun. Aoun was scheduled to fly through Larnaca International Airport in Cyprus en route to Casablanca, Morocco, for last month's Arab Summit.

The six Lebanese individuals were detained by the police on May 30th after several SAM-7 surface-to-air missiles and launchers were discovered by the police near Larnaca Airport.

The Larnaca District Court will conduct a preliminary hearing on this case on June 30th.

　　６名黎巴嫩人被控阴谋暗杀奥恩
    新华社尼科西亚６月２２日电  据塞浦路斯通讯社今天报道，塞浦路斯一地方法院指控６名黎巴嫩公民参加谋杀阴谋。
    这６名黎巴嫩穆斯林人承认他们计划用导弹击落黎巴嫩基督教领导人奥恩的座机。奥恩原定途经塞浦路斯拉纳卡国际机场飞往摩洛哥卡萨布兰卡参加上月举行的阿拉伯首脑会议。
    这６名黎巴嫩人是在警方在拉纳卡机场附近发现了数枚萨姆—７地对空导弹及发射器之后于５月３０日被警方拘留的。
    拉纳卡区法院将于６月３０日就这一案件进行初审。
