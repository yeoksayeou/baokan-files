The June 9 edition of the People's Daily reported on its front page that Hong Kong resident Li Zhuoren arrived in Beijing from Hong Kong on May 31, claiming that his purpose was to provide assistance to illegal organizations such as the "Capital Federation of Autonomous Student Unions," the "Capital Federation of Autonomous Workers Unions," and the "Tiananmen Square Command Center." Upon his arrival, he immediately made contact with these illegal organizations. On June 3, a counter-revolutionary riot occurred in Beijing, and Li fled in a hurry on June 4, attempting to board a plane back to Hong Kong. After being educated by our public security authorities at the airport, he admitted that it was wrong to have contact with these counter-revolutionary riot organizations during the martial law period and to prepare to provide economic assistance. This report is worth reading and seriously considering by all well-meaning people, including the broad masses of Hong Kong compatriots. We believe that Li Zhuoren's actions are not an isolated or accidental individual behavior but are part of the activities of some individuals in Hong Kong who have openly disregarded our country's laws and have been fanning the flames of the turmoil in Beijing over a period of time. This is also another performance of certain political forces at home and abroad responding to each other and stirring up trouble. Consider the following reports from some Hong Kong newspapers at the end of May:

	1. The May 27 edition of the Ta Kung Pao reported that a delegation of 81 people from the Hong Kong Federation of Students and educational institutions, carrying some materials collected by the Hong Kong Federation of University Students, departed for Beijing.
	2. The May 27 edition of the Ming Pao reported that the Hong Kong Federation of University Students, the Contemporary China Research Association, and the Chinese University Student Union established a "Material Liaison Station" in Beijing and have made an urgent appeal to all Hong Kong citizens to quickly donate various materials, including blankets, sleeping bags, communication equipment, and cash, to be sent to Beijing as soon as possible to better assist the students.
	3. The May 29 edition of the Sing Tao Daily reported that the Hong Kong Federation of Students sent 900,000 Hong Kong dollars to Tiananmen Square to address the urgent needs of the students, which is estimated to support the student movement on the square for 9 days.
	4. The May 31 edition of the Ming Pao reported that the "Beijing Material Liaison Station" set up by the Chinese University Student Union, the Federation of Students, and the Contemporary China Research Association currently has approximately 1 million Hong Kong dollars. According to the same report in the Ming Pao, members of the Chinese University Student Union delegation in Beijing believe that "Hong Kong students and organizations can play a significant role in supporting Beijing students, not only financially but also in boosting morale," and "raising the morale of other students."

It is well known that the State Council, in accordance with Article 89, Item 16 of the Constitution, decided to "impose martial law in certain areas of Beijing starting from 10:00 AM on May 20, 1989." The first order issued by the Beijing Municipal Government in accordance with the martial law decree stipulates: "During the martial law period, it is strictly forbidden to hold parades, petition, go on strike, or engage in any other activities that disrupt normal order." At that time, some students were still gathering in Tiananmen Square within the martial law area to sit in protest, petition, or parade, which was a serious violation of the martial law decree. Individuals like Li Zhuoren from Hong Kong, during the martial law period in certain areas of Beijing, came to the mainland and even to Tiananmen Square to provide financial support, materials, and even communication equipment to encourage, support, and fund activities that violate martial law. This is a behavior that undermines our country's laws and order. Our country, based on the principle of "one country, two systems," allows Hong Kong to maintain its capitalist system for 50 years after 1997. What Hong Kong people say in Hong Kong is their own business. However, when Hong Kong people come to the mainland, they must respect and abide by China's laws. Recently, some individuals in Hong Kong have come to the mainland to encourage, support, and participate in illegal activities aimed at overthrowing the government of the People's Republic of China and subverting the socialist system, which is not allowed by Chinese law. Individuals like Li Zhuoren directly intervened in the turmoil in Beijing by coming to the martial law area, "encouraging" and "boosting the morale" of those who created the turmoil. This cannot but make all well-meaning people seriously consider: What role did their actions play in a group of people illegally occupying Tiananmen Square for a long time, continuously creating turmoil, and ultimately leading to a counter-revolutionary riot?

### 对近期香港某些人一些活动的看法

　　对近期香港某些人一些活动的看法
    全国人大常委会法制工作委员会八名工作人员
    ６月９日《人民日报》头版报道，香港居民李卓人于５月３１日自港来京，自称他此行的目的是向在天安门广场的“市高联”、“外高联”、“广场指挥部”等非法组织提供援助。他抵京当晚即与上述非法组织联系。６月３日北京发生反革命暴乱，李在６月４日仓皇逃离，准备登机返港，在机场经我公安机关教育后，承认在戒严期间与这些反革命阴谋暴乱的非法组织接触并准备进行经济援助是错误的。这篇报道很值得一切善良的人们、包括广大香港同胞认真地读一读，严肃地想一想。我们认为，李卓人此行决非孤立的偶然的个人行为，而是一段时间以来香港某些人公然无视我国法律，对北京发生的动乱推波助澜的活动的一个组成部分，也是国内外某些政治势力相互呼应、兴风作浪的又一次表演。请看５月底香港一些报纸的报道：
    一、《大公报》５月２７日报道，香港学联及教育机构主办的“北京学生慰问团”一行８１人，已携香港专上学生联会所收集的部分物资启程前往北京。
    二、《明报》５月２７日报道，香港专上学生联会、当代中国学会及中大学生会在北京成立了“物资联络站”，已向全港市民作紧急呼吁，尽快捐输各类物资，包括毛毡、睡袋、通讯器材、现金等，以便尽速把物资运送北京，更有效地帮助学生。
    三、《成报》５月２９日报道，香港学联送款９０万港元解天安门广场学生燃眉之急，用来购买必需品，估计可为广场学运支持９天的需要。
    四、《明报》５月３１日报道，由中大学生会、学联及当代中国学会等设立的“驻京物资联络站”，目前约有１００万港元。
    另据《明报》同一篇报道，香港中文大学学生会驻北京代表团成员认为，“香港学生及团体对北京学生的支援，除了金钱上支持外，可以发挥很大的鼓舞作用”，“提高其他学生的士气”。
    众所周知，国务院根据宪法第八十九条第十六项赋予的职权，决定“自１９８９年５月２０日１０时起在北京市部分地区实行戒严”，北京市人民政府根据国务院戒严令发布的第一号命令规定：“在戒严期间，严禁游行、请愿罢课、罢工和其他聚众妨害正常秩序的活动”。当时，一部分学生仍然在戒严区内的天安门广场聚众静坐示威请愿或者游行示威，这是严重违反戒严令的违法行为。香港李卓人之类人士在北京部分地区实行戒严期间，到内地甚至来到天安门广场以提供金钱、物资甚至通讯器材鼓励、支持、资助违反戒严令的违法活动，这是破坏我国法律和秩序的行为。我国根据“一国两制”的原则，允许香港在１９９７年后保持资本主义制度５０年不变。香港人在香港发表什么主张，那是他们自己的事。但是香港人来到内地，就必须尊重中国的法律，遵守中国的法律。最近香港某些人到内地来鼓励、支持、参与颠覆中华人民共和国政府和推翻社会主义制度的非法活动，是中国法律所不能允许的。李卓人之类人士来到戒严地区的北京直接插手北京的动乱，对那些制造动乱的人“鼓舞”“提高”所谓“士气”，这就不能不使一切善良的人们认真思考：他们这种行为对一部分人长期聚众非法占据天安门广场，不断制造动乱，最后酿成的一场反革命暴乱，到底起着什么样的作用。
