An American hostage has been released.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, June 23rd: According to news from Jerusalem, American rescue worker Chris George was released this afternoon in the Gaza Strip after being kidnapped for 30 hours.

The vice president of the "Save the Children Federation" based in the United States said to reporters after his release that the kidnappers, who are said to be linked to the Palestine Liberation Organization, asked him to deliver a letter to U.S. President Bush.

The six-page letter stated that the kidnapping was not intended to harm Americans but aimed to draw international attention, particularly in the United States, to the plight of the Palestinians and their demand for independence.

The letter also requested that the U.S. President, like the French President, hold talks with PLO Chairman Arafat.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Embassy in Israel said after George's release that he was unaware of any conditions for the release.

After George was kidnapped, a PLO spokesperson in Tunis issued a statement condemning the kidnappers' "criminal actions" and demanding his immediate release.

　　被绑架的美国人获释
    新华社开罗６月２３日电  据来自耶路撒冷的消息，美国援救人员克里斯·乔治在遭绑架３０小时之后于今日下午在加沙地带被释放。
    这位设在美国的“挽救儿童联合会”副会长在释放后对记者说，那些据说同巴勒斯坦解放组织有联系的绑架者要求他将一封信带给美国总统布什。
    这封长达６页的信说，此绑架行动并不是有意伤害美国人，而是旨在呼吁国际舆论，特别是美国舆论，了解巴勒斯坦人的困境和他们的独立要求。
    这封信还要求美国总统像法国总统那样同巴勒斯坦解放组织主席阿拉法特会谈。
    美国驻以色列使馆发言人在乔治被释放后说，他不知道这一释放的任何条件。
    乔治被绑架后，巴解组织发言人在突尼斯曾发表声明，谴责绑架者的“罪恶行径”，并要求立即释放乔治。
