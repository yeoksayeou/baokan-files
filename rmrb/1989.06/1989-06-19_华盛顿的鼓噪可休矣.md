	The clamor from Washington should cease
	Jián Zhīqián

	Some individuals within the U.S. government and certain political figures have recently made a lot of noise about the Chinese government and people's suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot. They accuse the Chinese government's suppression of the riot as a "massacre of civilians" and threaten to impose various sanctions on China. These actions by Washington cannot but arouse the indignation of the broad masses of the Chinese people.

	The recent counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, the capital of China, is an inevitable historical necessity that cannot be changed by human will. A small number of people hostile to the socialist system first created chaos and then developed it into a counter-revolutionary riot. Countless facts show that this was a riot with an international background, planned and organized, aimed at overthrowing the leadership of the Communist Party of China and subverting the socialist system. The Chinese government resolutely suppressed this riot, preventing greater losses to the lives and property of the people and the achievements of construction. This is a matter within the sovereignty of a sovereign state. I ask the U.S. government, would it allow a similar riot to occur and spread in Washington and do nothing about it?

	Some members of the U.S. Congress and certain individuals in the White House, acting as if they were the "saviors of human rights," have been recklessly pointing fingers and making accusations about what is happening within China's borders. They even pass resolutions to attack China, as if they were so "humane." However, history has long nailed them to the cross of shame.

	Those gentlemen in Washington who always talk about human rights should remember that in the past, when black people in Little Rock, Arkansas, demonstrated against racial segregation policies and supported a black girl attending a public school, the authorities actually used fully armed National Guards to obstruct them, causing the shocking Little Rock incident. They should also remember that in the 1960s, the black people's struggle against racial segregation, such as the "Freedom to Enter School," "Freedom to Dine," and "Freedom to Ride" movements, were repeatedly suppressed by the U.S. authorities. Especially after the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr., the leader of the black civil rights movement, to suppress the black people who participated in the protests, the U.S. government mobilized a large number of regular troops and the well-equipped 82nd Airborne Division, causing the most severe bloodshed in U.S. history after World War II. What is even more unforgettable is that during the nationwide anti-Vietnam War protests, the U.S. government had repeatedly used force against the protesters. The consequences of these events still have an impact on American politics today. I ask, what qualifications do the gentlemen in Washington have to talk about "human rights" and "freedom" there? What right do they have to criticize the Chinese government's just actions in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot?

	During the process of the Chinese government and people suppressing this counter-revolutionary riot, certain individuals in Washington played a very unseemly role. Before making arrogant accusations and interfering in China's sovereignty and internal affairs, the U.S. authorities should consider the consequences of their own erroneous actions!

　　华盛顿的鼓噪可休矣
    詹之乾
    美国政府中的一些人和某些政界人士最近对中国政府和人民平息反革命暴乱一事，发出不少鼓噪。他们指责中国政府的平息暴乱是“大规模屠杀平民”，扬言要对中国采取这样那样的制裁。华盛顿的这些作法，不能不激起广大中国人民的义愤。
    中国首都北京最近发生的反革命暴乱，是不以人们的意志为转移的历史必然。极少数敌视社会主义制度的人先是制造动乱，而后发展到反革命暴乱。无数事实表明，这是一次有国际背景的、有计划、有组织的暴乱，其目的是推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义制度。中国政府坚决平息了这场暴乱，避免人民群众的生命财产和建设成果遭受更大的损失，这是一个主权国家范围内的事。试问美国政府，是否能允许类似的暴乱在华盛顿发生和蔓延，并听之任之？
    美国国会一些议员和白宫的某些先生，俨然以“人权的救世主”自居，无所顾忌地对中国境内发生的事情颐指气使、横加指责，甚至还通过这个、那个决议，对中国攻击一番，好像他们就是那样地“讲仁政”。可是，历史的记录，早把他们自己钉在耻辱的十字架上。
    华盛顿那些言必称人权的先生们应该记得，当年阿肯色州小石城的黑人群众为反对种族隔离政策、支持黑人女孩去公立学校就读而举行示威，当局竟动用全副武装的国民警卫队进行阻挠，造成震惊世界的小石城事件。还应该记得，６０年代美国黑人反对种族隔离而掀起的“自由入校”、“自由进餐”、“自由乘车”运动此伏彼起，但是，几乎每一次抗议浪潮都遭到美国当局的镇压。特别是当黑人民权运动领袖马丁·路德·金被枪杀之后，为了镇压参加抗议的黑人群众，美国政府调动大批正规军和装备精良的第８２空降师，酿成了战后美国历史上空前的流血事件。更令人记忆犹新的是，在遍及全国的反对越南战争浪潮中，美国政府曾多次动用武力对付抗议群众，这些事件的后果，至今仍对美国政治产生影响。试问，华盛顿的先生们还有什么资格在那里侈谈什么“人权”和“自由”？！有什么权利指责中国政府镇压反革命暴乱的正义行动？
    在中国政府和人民平息这场反革命暴乱过程中，华盛顿的某些先生扮演了很不光彩的角色。在对中国的主权和内政进行蛮横的指责和干涉之前，美国当局还是考虑一下自己这种错误行为的结果吧！
