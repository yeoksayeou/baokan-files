Recently, the Director of the State Bureau of Quality and Technical Supervision, Zhu Zhenyuan, stated that from January to April this year, the rate of non-compliant exported goods was 3.76%, a decrease compared to the same period last year. The rate of non-compliant imported goods for the same period was 15.33%, a reduction of 4.77 percentage points compared to the same period last year.

Zhu Zhenyuan revealed that preparations for the implementation of the Quality and Technical Supervision Law on August 1 are currently being accelerated. The "Catalog of Imported and Exported Goods Subject to Quality Inspection by Quality and Technical Supervision Authorities" and the "Catalog of Goods Subject to Import Quality Permit System" are expected to be published before August 1. The draft of the "Regulations for the Implementation of the Quality and Technical Supervision Law," which is to be paired with the law, has been submitted to the State Council for approval.

Zhu Zhenyuan reiterated that the quality inspection work of imported and exported goods by national quality inspection authorities is based on the economic contracts signed by both parties and strictly adheres to the terms of the contract. He urged domestic and foreign enterprises to specify quality requirements as concretely as possible when signing contracts.

　　我进出口商品质量普遍提高
    本报北京六月十六日讯  记者潘岗报道：今年以来，我国进口、出口商品质量普遍提高。国家商检局局长朱震元日前称：今年一至四月，出口商品不合格率为百分之三点七六，比去年同期有所降低；前四个月进口商品不合格率为百分之十五点三三，比去年同期下降四点七七个百分点。
    朱震元透露，为八月一日正式实施商检法的各项准备工作，目前正在加紧进行。《商检机构实施检验的进出口商品总类表》、《进口商品质量许可制度的商品目录》完全有把握在八月一日前公布，与商检法配套的商检法实施条例初稿已报国务院审定。
    朱震元重申，国家商品检验机关对进出口商品的检验工作，依据的是双方签订的经济合同，严格按合同办事。他呼吁中外企业签订合同时，尽量将有关质量的要求作具体规定。
