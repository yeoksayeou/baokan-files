The Editor's Passion and the Writer's Dream

He Qǐzhì is both an editor and a writer. He has always nurtured a writer's dream. Before long, he will turn fifty, yet he remains steadfast in his pursuit.

During the New Year, I went to visit him. Amidst a thick pile of proofs, a pair of smiling eyes emerged.

The leaves of the sea buckthorn are lush, and the laughing flowers are half-bloomed. That is his home, his small study.

"How come you don't rest during the New Year?"

"Ah, us!" A single word encapsulates a world of meaning.

Still smiling, he offers a seat and brews some tea. Then, cradling a cup of fragrant tea, he enthusiastically discusses the novel he is currently proofreading.

"Are you tired? Exhausted?" I gaze into those reddened eyes.

"Look, the laughing flowers are blooming."

Amidst the green leaves, three radiant flowers bloom modestly, smiling.

He is no longer young, but his face bears a youthful glow, and his steps are as vigorous and powerful as a young man's. Though he is occasionally plagued by illness, his abundant vitality still fills him with energy.

As an editor, he passionately discovers new authors and nurtures new works. From the manuscripts submitted to Guangxi, he discovered the novel "Roadside Anecdotes." The author, Shí Shānhào, is a telegraph operator in a small town. He wrote to the author multiple times, urging revisions. The work was revised, garnered attention, and he had yet to meet the author. Four years later, when he went to Guangxi to lecture, he met this young man who loves writing and playing basketball. The young man said, "It was you who published this novel that changed my life, making me unstoppable. Now, Shí Shānhào is studying at the Wuhan University Writers' Class.

In Mian County, Sichuan, there is a man named Jiāng Tāng who wrote a novel titled "New Rules in Effect Today." He Qǐzhì selected it from the natural submissions, and after publication, it received a good response. "Novel Monthly" reprinted it, and it won the Hundred Flowers Award.

As the deputy editor-in-chief of "Contemporary" magazine, he also has the courage and resolve to publish cutting-edge works under pressure. Last year, the work "Dream of a Strong Nation," which caused a significant stir in society and was reported in the "internal reference" and accused, was handled and approved by him. This work won the first "Chinese Tide" essay contest award.

As a writer and critic, he has never put down his pen. Between editing tasks, in the quiet of the night, he sips a cup of fragrant tea, squints his eyes, which seem to always hold a smile, and quietly cultivates his own garden.

He writes on the bed in his small house, in the simple wooden room in the publishing house courtyard, in the quiet office at night...

In recent years, with emotion and sincerity, he has written critiques of long novels such as Gǔ Huá's "Hibiscus Town" and Zhāng Wěi's "Ancient Ship."

He does not have large blocks of time, nor a comfortable environment. He relies solely on diligence and hard work to weave his writer's dream.

Comrade Qín Mù read some of his essay drafts and recommended to New Sprout Press that he write "Stories of Lu Xun." He then collected materials, drafted an outline, and wrote the initial draft during his editing breaks. In August 1981, "Stories of Young Lu Xun" was published, and in May of the following year, it won the first prize for excellent children's literature nationwide.

Additionally, he wrote the novel "Before Dawn" (published by People's Literature Publishing House) and the essay and reportage collection "Dream, Bodhisattva, and the Fifteenth Moon" (published by Lijiang Publishing House). Furthermore, the reportage "Spreading the Spirit of Lu Xun," which he co-wrote, won the national excellent reportage award.

The famous poet and editor of "Blue Star Poetry Magazine" in Taiwan, Xiàng Míng, and the Taiwanese novelist Wáng Yí, commissioned Gǔ Jìtáng to edit "Mainland Critics' Biographies" and invited He Qǐzhì to write a biography for himself. The fifty-something-year-old man is once again deep in thought. "Fifty is neither dream nor smoke," he must leave something for the world. There is a rainbow of reason that always attracts and illuminates him, and that is his literary dream...

### 编辑情怀作家梦

　　编辑情怀作家梦
    李汉平
    何启治是编辑，也是作家。他一直做着作家梦。转眼已年过半百，依然梦得执著。
    新年时我去看他。厚厚的一堆校样中升起一双含笑的眼睛。
    海棠叶正肥，含笑花半开。那是他的家，他的小小的书斋。
    “怎么？过年也不休息？”
    “嗨，我们！”一言难尽，一语道破。
    仍旧含笑，让座、泡茶。然后捧一杯香茗，津津乐道地谈起正在校对的小说。
    “苦么？累么？”我望定那双泛红的眼睛。
    “你看，含笑开花了。”
    绿叶丛中，三朵灿灿的花，含蓄地微笑着。
    他不年轻了，可是一张脸上浮着年轻人似的红晕，步子也如年轻人似地矫健、有力。虽然也不时被疾病所苦，可是那丰盛的生命的底蕴仍使他充满活力。
    作为一个编辑，他热情地发现新作者，扶植新作。在广西来稿中发现了小说《路边轶事》。作者石山浩是个小镇上的电报员。他三番五次地给作者写信，让作者修改。作品改成了，引起反响了，他跟作者还未谋一面。四年后，他去广西讲学时见到了这个爱写作也爱打篮球的小伙子。小伙子说，是您给我编发的这篇小说改变了我的命运，使我一发而不可收。现在，石山浩正在武汉大学作家班学习。
    四川万县有个姜汤，写了篇小说叫《新客规今天生效》。何启治从自然来稿中把它筛选出来，编发后反应很好，《小说月报》转载，并获百花奖。
    作为《当代》杂志的副总编，他又有顶着压力上尖端作品的胆魄和勇气。去年在社会上引起很大反响和上了“内参”被告状的《强国梦》就是他经手签发的。这篇作品获得了首届“中国潮”征文奖。
    作为一个作家和评论家，他又一直没有放下手中的笔。编稿之余，夜深人静的时候，他喝一杯香茶，眯起那双似乎永远含笑的眼睛，悄悄地耕耘着他自己的园地。
    他在小小家屋的床板上写，他在出版社大院简易的木板房里写，他在寂静无人的夜晚的办公室里写……
    这些年，他带着感动和真诚，写了关于古华的《芙蓉镇》和张炜的《古船》等长篇小说的评论。
    他没有整块的时间，没有优裕的环境，全靠着刻苦和勤奋作为经纬，来编织他的作家梦。
    秦牧同志看过他的一些散文原稿，向新蕾出版社推荐他写《鲁迅故事》。他便在编余收集材料，拟定提纲，写出初稿。１９８１年８月，《少年鲁迅的故事》出版，第二年５月获全国优秀少儿读物一等奖。
    此外，他还写了长篇小说《天亮之前》（人民文学出版社出版），散文、报告文学集《梦·菩萨·十五的月亮》（漓江出版社出版），另外，他与人合作的报告文学《播鲁迅精神之火》，获全国优秀报告文学奖。
    台湾著名诗人、《蓝星诗刊》主编向明和台湾小说家王怡委托古继堂编《大陆评论家传》，邀何启治为自己写一篇传记。年过半百的他又在面壁思索了。“五十非梦亦非烟”，他总要给这世界留下一些东西。有一道理想的彩虹始终在吸引着他，照耀着他，那就是他的文学梦……
