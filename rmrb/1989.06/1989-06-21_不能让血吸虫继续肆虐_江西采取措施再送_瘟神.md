    **Do Not Let Schistosomiasis Continue to Ravage**
    **Jiangxi Takes Measures to Send the "Plague" Packing Again**

    In recent years, the schistosomiasis situation in Jiangxi Province has shown signs of resurgence, threatening the health of over 2.5 million people in the affected areas. Currently, the province is taking multiple measures to send the "plague" packing again.

    Jiangxi Province is one of the most severely affected areas of schistosomiasis in southern China. Since the founding of New China, the province has invested over 200 million yuan in the fight against schistosomiasis, achieving remarkable results.

    However, since 1983, the province's schistosomiasis control work has shown a downward trend, and the "plague" has made a comeback. The number of schistosomiasis patients, the area infested with Oncomelania snails, and the number of infected cattle in the Poyang Lake area and along the Yangtze River have all increased, with some areas experiencing acute outbreaks and infection rates as high as 98%. Currently, the province has a total of 320,000 patients, with the proportion of young and middle-aged individuals increasing year by year. There are over 80,000 infected cattle, and the area infested with Oncomelania snails reaches over 1.24 million mu.

    Jiangxi Provincial Governor Wu Guanzheng and Vice Governor Chen Guizun have both inspected the Poyang Lake affected areas. Recently, the provincial government decided to allocate 3 million yuan from its tight fiscal budget to supplement schistosomiasis control work. Together with the 4.8 million yuan originally allocated by local governments this year for schistosomiasis control, the total schistosomiasis control funds for the province in 1989 will reach a record high for the past 40 years.

    Relevant provincial departments have conducted reform pilot projects for snail eradication in lake areas. This year, the Jiangxi Institute of Parasitic Diseases and Jinxian County cooperated to deep plow and plant 1,000 mu of sesame on the grasslands of Poyang Lake under the county's jurisdiction.

　　不能让血吸虫继续肆虐    
    江西采取措施再送“瘟神”
    新华社南昌６月２１日电（记者陈瑶、骆国骏）江西省血吸虫病疫情近年回升，疫区２５０余万群众的健康受到威胁。目前这个省正采取多项措施，再送“瘟神”。
    江西省是我国南方血吸虫病重疫区。新中国成立以来，全省已耗资２亿多元用于血防事业，成就辉煌。
    但是，１９８３年以后，这个省血防工作呈“滑坡”趋势，“瘟神”卷土重来，鄱阳湖区和长江沿岸县市的血吸虫病患者、钉螺面积、病牛头数等全面回升，局部地区发生急性爆发流行和高达９８％的感染人群。目前全省有病人总数３２万，青壮年比例逐年增加，病牛８万多头，有螺面积达１２４万多亩。
    江西省省长吴官正、副省长陈癸尊曾先后考察鄱阳湖疫区。最近，省政府决定从十分紧张的财政中挤出３００万元专款补助血防工作，加上当年各地财政原定用于血防的４８０万元，１９８９年全省血防经费将达到血防４０年来的最高纪录。
    省有关部门对湖滩灭螺作了改革试点。今年，由省寄生虫病研究所和进贤县合作，在该县所辖的鄱阳湖草滩上深耕垦种１０００亩芝麻。
