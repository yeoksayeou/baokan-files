	The small business owners who could only barely make ends meet in old China have almost without exception become wealthy overnight. Why is this? A survey in Gu Cheng County, Hubei Province, sheds some light on the mystery from one angle.

	The survey shows that among the 5,185 individual industrial and commercial households in the county, 80% engage in tax evasion. Those who evade the most can avoid paying over 7,000 yuan annually. Their methods of tax evasion are numerous, including underreporting business revenue, issuing fewer or no invoices, using other people's names or signs, or adopting a "hit-and-run" tactic to wage "guerrilla warfare" against industrial and commercial and tax authorities. In the entire county, 98% of individual households have tens of thousands of yuan in cash on hand. The direction of this large sum of money will seriously threaten market stability.

	It is understood that if individual industrial and commercial households pay taxes according to current tax laws, it will be very difficult for them to become wealthy. The monthly business revenue of clothing individual households in the county is generally around 10,000 yuan, with a gross profit rate of about 20%, meaning they can earn around 2,000 yuan per month. According to regulations, in addition to paying individual industrial and commercial household income tax, they must also pay product tax, urban maintenance and construction tax, additional education fees, and energy and transportation construction fund fees, totaling approximately 1,060 yuan. Additionally, they must pay industrial and commercial management fees of 200 yuan and helper fees of 200 yuan. Furthermore, they must deduct other business expenses, so an individual household with a business revenue of 10,000 yuan has a monthly income of only about 400 yuan.

	It can be seen that tax evasion is a major reason for the wealth of individual industrial and commercial households.

### 不少个体户靠逃税暴富

　　不少个体户靠逃税暴富
    曾经在旧中国只能勉强维持生计的小生意人，如今却几乎无一例外地成了暴发户。原因何在？湖北省谷城县的一项调查，从一个侧面道出了个中奥妙。
    这项调查表明，在该县５１８５家个体工商户中，８０％存在偷漏税行为。其漏交金额多的，每年可达７０００余元。他们偷漏税手段很多，除少报营业额、少开或不开发票外还有的借用他人名义，他人招牌，或采取“打一枪换一个地方”的方法与工商、税务人员进行“游击战”。全县９８％的个体户，手中持有数万元现金，这笔巨款的投向，将严重威胁市场稳定。
    据了解，如果按当前的税收法照章纳税，个体工商户暴富是很困难的。该县的服装个体户月营业额一般在１万元左右，毛利率大致为２０％，即每月可赚２０００元左右。按照规定，除须交纳城乡个体工商业户所得税外，还须交产品税，城市维护建设税，附加教育费、能源交通基金费，合计大致为１０６０元许，另外还须交工商管理费２００元，支付帮工费２００元，此外尚须剔除其他业务性支出，这样，营业额为１万元的个体户，月收入实际只有４００多元。
    由此可见，偷税漏税是导致个体工商户暴富的重要原因。
