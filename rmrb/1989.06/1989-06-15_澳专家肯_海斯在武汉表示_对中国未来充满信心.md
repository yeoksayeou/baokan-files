Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, June 15th. (Reporter Luo Hui) On June 13th, the "foreign manager" Ken Hayes, who works in Wuhan, said, "I hope China can quickly recover from the turmoil, the sooner the better."

He made these remarks during a meeting with foreign experts and representatives of foreign-invested enterprises in Wuhan, which was arranged by the city's deputy mayor Wang Mingquan. He said, "Over the past year, the Chinese side has given me a lot of support for my work. Now that China is facing difficulties, I will not leave Wuhan. I am full of confidence in China's future and will continue to do everything I can."

The 67-year-old Ken Hayes is an Australian expert. Last year, he took the initiative to take over the management of Changhong Mold Factory, a key enterprise in China that produces plastic molds. This was the first time a domestic enterprise was managed by a foreigner.

After the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing, Wuhan also experienced turmoil. Traffic on the Yangtze River Bridge was disrupted, and criminals set up roadblocks at intersections, which once disrupted normal production and living order.

Deputy Mayor Wang Mingquan said, "Wuhan's steps towards opening up to the outside world will not stop. We will continue to implement a series of policies to encourage foreign investment and protect the interests of foreign parties in Wuhan."

　　澳专家肯·海斯在武汉表示
    对中国未来充满信心
    据新华社武汉６月１５日电  （记者罗辉）在武汉工作的“洋厂长”肯·海斯先生６月１３日说：“我希望中国迅速从动乱中恢复过来，越快越好”。
    他是在武汉市副市长王明权约见在汉外国专家和部分“三资企业”外方代表时说这番话的。他说：“一年多来，中方对我的工作给予了很大的支持，现在在中国困难的时候我决不会离开武汉。对中国的未来我充满信心，我将继续尽我的力量，做我所能做的一切”。
    今年６７岁的肯·海斯先生是澳大利亚专家，去年，他主动提出承包了我国生产塑料模具的重点骨干企业长虹模具厂。国内企业由外国人来承包经营，这在我国还是第一例。
    北京发生了反革命暴乱后，武汉也发生了动乱。长江大桥交通受阻，歹徒在交通路口设置路障，正常的生产和生活秩序曾一度受到了干扰。
    王明权副市长说：“武汉对外开放的步子绝不会停下来，将继续认真执行鼓励外商投资的一系列政策，保护外方在武汉的利益。”
