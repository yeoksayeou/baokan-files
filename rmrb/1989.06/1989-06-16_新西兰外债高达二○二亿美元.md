Xinhua News Agency, Wellington, June 16th.

A New Zealand bank issued a report today stating that by the end of March this year, New Zealand's external debt had reached $20.2 billion.

The bank stated that although external debt has decreased over the past year, by international standards, New Zealand's external debt figures have reached an unacceptable level for its people.

New Zealand has a population of over 3.2 million. In the year up to March this year, $3.3 billion in external debt has been repaid, reducing the proportion of external debt in the GDP from 60% to 51%. Despite this, the figure is still higher than the average of 40% for smaller countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development.

The report believes that New Zealand must strive to reduce the current trade deficit from 2.3% of GDP to at least 1%. At the same time, it must further accelerate economic development to reduce external debt to an acceptable level for its people over the next ten years. However, achieving these two goals will be very difficult.

### 新西兰外债高达二○二亿美元

　　新西兰外债高达二○二亿美元
    新华社惠灵顿六月十六日电  一家新西兰银行今天发表一份报告说，新西兰外债到今年三月底为止，高达二百零二亿美元。
    这家银行说，尽管过去的一年中外债有所下降，但按国际标准计算，新西兰外债数字已高到令人民无法接受的地步。
    新西兰全国人口三百二十多万。到今年三月为止的一年中已偿还外债三十三亿美元，从而使外债在国内生产总值中的所占比例从百分之六十一下降到百分之五十一。尽管如此，这数字仍高于经济合作与发展组织中较小国家外债占国内生产总值百分之四十的平均数。
    该报告认为，新西兰必须努力使目前国际收支赤字从占国内生产总值百分之二点三至少下降到百分之一。同时，进一步提高经济发展速度，以便在今后十年内使外债下降到人民可以接受的水平。但是，要达到这二项目标是非常困难的。
