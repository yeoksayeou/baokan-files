Second Artillery, Military Science Academy, Central Military Commission Directly Affiliated Organs, Zhejiang Province, and Six Industrial Corporations Send Telegram to the Central Authorities in Support of Suppressing the Counterrevolutionary Riot in the Capital

Second Artillery, Central Military Commission, and the Party Central Committee, State Council:

Since June 3, the political turmoil that has persisted for over a month in Beijing, under the instigation and incitement of a very small number of people, has rapidly escalated into a counterrevolutionary riot. Their evil intentions to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party and negate the socialist system have been fully exposed. Their brutal methods of beating, smashing, looting, burning, and killing are horrifying. At this critical moment for the Party and the nation, the Party Central Committee, State Council, and Central Military Commission have swiftly taken decisive and resolute measures to suppress the counterrevolutionary riot, stabilize the capital, and calm the nation. This is extremely timely and completely correct, and it has won the hearts of the Party, the military, and the people. We firmly support this.

In recent days, the Standing Committee of the Second Artillery Party Committee has seriously studied the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Entire Nation" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, as well as the speeches by Li Peng, Yang Shangkun, and Qiao Shi on June 6. They unanimously believe that the initial victory in suppressing the counterrevolutionary riot in Beijing has been achieved, but the situation in the capital and throughout the country remains very serious. At this critical moment when the Party and the state face life-and-death struggles, it is a practical test for every Communist Party member, especially high-level leaders. The people's army, as the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, must always maintain high political and operational unity with the Party Central Committee. The Second Artillery Party Committee has promptly forwarded the speeches of the central leaders and related materials on suppressing the counterrevolutionary riot to the troops, requiring them to seriously study and disseminate, unifying the thoughts of the broad masses of officers and soldiers with the spirit of the Party Central Committee. They must also strengthen management, make organizational preparations, and be ready to execute all tasks assigned by the Central Military Commission at any time. With practical actions, they will defend the People's Republic, which was won with the blood and lives of countless revolutionary martyrs, and defend the great achievements of a decade of reform and construction.

Military Science Academy Political Department:

In recent days, the Standing Committee of the Military Science Academy Party Committee has repeatedly studied the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Entire Nation" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, as well as the June 4 editorial of the Liberation Army Daily, and held serious discussions.

The attendees expressed great indignation and strong condemnation towards a group of ruthless rioters who obstructed the execution of duties by the capital's martial law troops, brutally beat and humiliated our Liberation Army officers and soldiers, and created a horrifying counterrevolutionary riot. They unanimously and resolutely support the correct decision of the Party Central Committee, State Council, and Central Military Commission to suppress the counterrevolutionary riot. They highly praise the initial victory achieved by the martial law troops, the capital's public security personnel, and the armed police in suppressing the riot, and express deep condolences to the officers and soldiers who sacrificed their lives in the process.

Everyone unanimously believes that the counterrevolutionary riot that occurred on June 3 is the malicious development of a period of conspiracy by a very small number of people to create turmoil. It is a concentrated and naked exposure of their opposition to the leadership of the Communist Party of China, their opposition to the socialist system, and their promotion of bourgeois liberalization. Once their conspiracy succeeds, it will plunge our country and nation into a deep disaster. Resolutely suppressing this counterrevolutionary riot fully represents the interests and common wishes of the entire Party, the entire military, and the people of all ethnic groups in the country.

The Standing Committee members unanimously expressed that, in the current severe situation, they will resolutely maintain high unity with the Party Central Committee, closely unite around the Party Central Committee, listen to the Party, and not be disturbed by rumors. They will stand firm in their posts and do their jobs well, striving to completely suppress this riot.

Central Military Commission Directly Affiliated Organs Political Department:

In recent days, all Communist Party members, Communist Youth League members, all cadres, soldiers, and workers of the Central Military Commission Directly Affiliated Organs have listened to the radio broadcast of the martial law troops quickly suppressing the counterrevolutionary riot and the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Entire Nation" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council with great excitement. They have held serious discussions. Everyone unanimously believes that, at this critical moment concerning the life and death of the Party and the state, the Party Central Committee, State Council, and Central Military Commission have taken decisive and resolute measures to quickly suppress the counterrevolutionary riot that occurred in the capital. This is extremely wise and correct, and we firmly support it.

Everyone expresses great indignation and strong condemnation towards the extremely inhuman crimes committed by a very small number of counterrevolutionary rioters. In a period, a very small number of people have planned, premeditated, and organized to incite and create turmoil, which has escalated into a horrifying counterrevolutionary riot. Their evil purpose is to overthrow the people's democratic dictatorship, overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China, and overthrow the socialist system. The officers and soldiers of the martial law troops, public security personnel, and armed police have resolutely executed the orders of the Party Central Committee, State Council, and Central Military Commission, standing firm, bravely and tenaciously defending the people's power and the dignity of the capital with their blood and lives. Everyone expresses high respect to the officers and soldiers of the martial law troops who have established immortal merits in suppressing the counterrevolutionary riot, extends warm regards to the comrades who were injured in the process, and expresses deep sorrow for the martyrs who were harmed by the counterrevolutionary rioters.

Comrades unanimously expressed that, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, State Council, and Central Military Commission, they will carry out the struggle to suppress the counterrevolutionary riot to the end and make active contributions to safeguarding the security of the capital and stabilizing the situation throughout the country. The following work should be done at present: (1) Seriously study and propagate the series of important instructions of the Party Central Committee, fully understand the great significance of this political struggle, and firmly believe in victory. In any situation, we must maintain high unity with the Party Central Committee. (2) Thoroughly expose the crimes and conspiracies of the counterrevolutionary rioters, carry forward the fearless revolutionary spirit, and resolutely fight against all counterrevolutionary words and deeds that harm the interests of the state and the people. (3) Carry forward the glorious tradition of the people's army loving the government and the people, love the capital, love the people of the capital, love the youth students, and make contributions to quickly restoring the normal social order, production order, living order, and scientific research and teaching order of the capital. (4) Stand firm in their posts, fulfill their duties, and resolutely complete all tasks assigned by the Central Military Commission. (5) Stay alert, prevent and crack down on the sabotage activities of the counterrevolutionary rioters, and safeguard the security of the Central Military Commission leadership organs.

Zhejiang Province, Party Central Committee, State Council, Central Military Commission:

Since June 4, the Provincial Party Committee has held five consecutive Standing Committee meetings, seriously studying the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Entire Nation" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, as well as the important documents such as the June 4 editorial of the Liberation Army Daily. Everyone unanimously believes that the counterrevolutionary riot that occurred in Beijing on June 3 and 4 was a conspiracy planned and deliberately instigated by a very small number of people, aiming to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and the socialist system. The inhuman counterrevolutionary crimes of a small group of rioters are shocking. At this critical moment concerning the life and death of the Party and the state, the Party Central Committee, State Council, and Central Military Commission have taken decisive and resolute measures to suppress this counterrevolutionary riot in a situation of no other choice. This is extremely correct. We firmly support the wise decision of the Party Central Committee, State Council, and Central Military Commission, and resolutely maintain political and operational unity with the Party Central Committee. We express high respect and warm regards to the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army capital martial law troops, armed police troops, and public security personnel who have made outstanding contributions in this struggle.

In recent days, the Provincial Party Committee and Provincial Government have, through various means, required all Party members, cadres, and the masses in the province to be clear in their attitudes and stand firmly with the Party Central Committee and the State Council in this struggle. They should do their jobs well, pass the test, and make due contributions to completely suppressing the counterrevolutionary riot, safeguarding the People's Republic of China, and maintaining the stability of Zhejiang and Hangzhou.

1. Require all levels of Party committees and governments to organize Party members, cadres, and the masses to further study the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Entire Nation" and other important documents by the Party Central Committee and the State Council. They should recognize the nature of the counterrevolutionary riot event in Beijing, the necessity and importance of suppressing this counterrevolutionary riot, unify their thoughts, improve their understanding, and work with the Party Central Committee to maintain stability.

2. Cadres and workers in organs, organizations, enterprises, and schools should overcome difficulties, stand firm in their posts, insist on production, work, and discipline, and ensure the normal order of production, work, and life.

3. After Beijing achieved initial victory in stopping the riot, we should be especially vigilant of the heads of a few illegal organizations in the capital dispersing to various places, plotting to create bigger incidents. Cities should organize forces at the district level, divide responsibilities, remove roadblocks, ensure the smooth flow of railways and urban traffic, and resolutely resist some people from inciting strikes and disrupting production in factories.

4. Strengthen public security management, enhance security protection, and strictly prevent bad people from taking advantage of the situation to cause disturbances, looting, burning, and destroying. Factories, organs, shops, and schools should organize forces to protect factories, shops, roads, and schools, do a good job in security protection for their units, and cooperate with public security personnel to maintain social order. Armed police and public security personnel should protect key departments and important facilities and severely crack down on criminals who take advantage of the situation to cause disturbances.

We should unite more closely, respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and the State Council with actual actions to stabilize the overall situation, stabilize Zhejiang, and stabilize Hangzhou.

Six Industrial Corporations, Party Central Committee, State Council:

In recent days, we, the six industrial frontline leadership organs and their affiliated enterprises and institutions, have seriously studied the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Entire Nation" by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council. We express great indignation towards the counterrevolutionary riot created by a very small number of rioters in the capital, firmly support the resolute measures taken by the Party Central Committee, State Council, and Central Military Commission to suppress this riot, and express high respect and warm regards to the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army martial law troops, armed police, and public security personnel. Today, the State Council issued a notice on "Resolutely Stopping the Disruption of the Economic Order and Ensuring the Normal Operation of Industrial Production," which we feel is very timely and important. We will definitely resolutely implement it.

We, the coal, petroleum, petrochemical, nuclear, non-ferrous metals, and shipbuilding industries, are directly related to the economic construction, national defense construction, and people's livelihood of the country. In this serious political struggle, we deeply understand the heavy responsibilities we bear and the sincere expectations of the Party and the state. We must fully rely on the broad masses of workers, overcome all difficulties, maintain the normal order of production and work, and do everything possible to increase production, providing a strong material foundation for stabilizing the overall situation and developing the economy.

In the past month, the broad masses of Communist Party members, cadres, and workers in our six industrial departments have, under extremely difficult conditions, always stood firm in their posts, insisted on production, and worked hard, and the situation is stable. According to the spirit of the State Council's "Notice," we will further take strong measures to continue strengthening ideological and political work, strengthening the organization and leadership of production, strengthening various security measures, and have notified our affiliated enterprises to give full play to the role of various levels of Party organizations and Communist Party members as fortresses and models in stabilizing the situation and promoting production. They should lead and unite the broad masses of workers, resolutely stop anyone from engaging in linking activities under any name, resolutely expose and crack down on all incitements to strikes and disruptions of production, and ensure the normal operation of all production and construction activities.

We, the 10 million industrial army of the six industrial fronts, are determined to unite around the Party Central Committee and the State Council, resolutely smash the conspiracy of a very small number of people to disrupt the economy and create chaos throughout the country, and strive for the leadership of the Party, the defense of the socialist system, the persistence of reform and opening up, and the advancement of socialist construction.

    第二炮兵中央军委并党中央、国务院：
    ６月３日以来，在北京持续一个多月的政治动乱，在极少数人的挑唆和煽动之下，急剧演变成一场反革命暴乱，其推翻共产党领导，否定社会主义制度的险恶用心已昭然若揭，其打、砸、抢、烧、杀手段之残忍骇人听闻。在党难、国难关头，党中央、国务院、中央军委迅速采取坚决、果断措施，平息反革命暴乱，稳定首都，安定全国，是十分及时，完全正确的，深得党心、军心、民心，我们坚决拥护。
    近日来，二炮党委常委认真学习中共中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》，学习李鹏、杨尚昆、乔石同志６月６日讲话，一致认为，平息北京的反革命暴乱取得了初步胜利，但目前首都乃至全国的局势仍然相当严峻。在党和国家面临着生死存亡的关键时刻，对我们每个共产党员、特别是高级领导干部都是一次最实际的考验。人民军队作为无产阶级专政的坚强柱石，何时何地都要与党中央在政治上行动上保持高度一致，坚决听从中央军委的指挥。二炮党委已及时把中央领导同志讲话和有关平息反革命暴乱的材料转发部队，要求认真搞好传达学习，把广大官兵的思想统一到党中央的精神上来，并加强管理，做好组织准备，随时准备执行中央军委赋予的各项任务，以实际行动来保卫千百万革命先烈用鲜血和生命换来的人民共和国，保卫十年改革和建设的伟大成果。
