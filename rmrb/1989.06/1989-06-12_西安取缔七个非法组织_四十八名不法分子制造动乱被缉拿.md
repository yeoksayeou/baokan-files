Xi'an Shuts Down Seven Illegal Organizations, 48 Lawbreakers Arrested for Causing Turmoil

Xi'an, June 12 (Xinhua) - The Xi'an Public Security Bureau announced this morning that as of June 11, the city's public security organs have apprehended 48 lawbreakers who disrupted social order and caused turmoil.

According to several notices issued by the Xi'an Municipal People's Government in recent days, the following seven illegal organizations have been disbanded in accordance with the law: the "Shaanxi Provincial Students' Autonomous Federation" (also known as "Provincial Student Federation"), the "Xi'an Workers' Democratic Autonomous Federation" (also known as "Municipal Workers' Federation"), the "Citizens' Support Group," the "Workers' Patrol Squad," the "Blood Debt Squad," and the "Suicide Squad."

The leaders of these illegal organizations, such as Ma Hongliang and Liu Congshu of the "Provincial Student Federation" and "Municipal Workers' Federation," who incited students, citizens, and workers to go on strike, disrupt government agencies, obstruct traffic, and cause turmoil, have been successively apprehended.

In addition, the "Suicide Squad," which had previously set up roadblocks, intercepted vehicles, and disrupted traffic and public order, not only refused to disband and cease illegal activities after the Xi'an Municipal Government's notice to disband illegal organizations was issued, but also put up resistance. Last night at 12 a.m., the leader of this organization, Liu Xiaolong, gathered Zhu Lin, Yu Yunjiang, Li Tao, Pang Xiaobin, and Wang Jianjun in Xingqing Palace Park to plot new schemes and was apprehended on the spot by public security officers.

　　西安取缔七个非法组织
    四十八名不法分子制造动乱被缉拿
    本报西安６月１２日电  西安市公安局今天上午提供的消息说，截至６月１１日，该市公安机关已抓获破坏社会秩序、制造动乱的不法分子４８名。
    按照西安市人民政府连日来发布的几个《通告》，“陕西省高校学生自治联合会”（即“省高自联”）、“西安工人民主联合自治会”（即“市工自联”）、“市民声援团”、“工人纠察队”、“讨血团”、“敢死队”等７个非法组织已被依法取缔。曾煽动学生、市民和工人罢课、罢市、罢工，冲击政府机关、破坏交通、制造动乱的“省高自联”、“市工自联”等非法组织的头目马洪良、刘丛书等相继被缉拿。
    此外，前些日子专门设置路障、堵截车辆、破坏交通和社会治安的“敢死队”，在西安市府取缔非法组织的《通告》下达后，不仅不解散组织、停止非法活动，反而负隅顽抗。昨晚１２时，这个组织的头目刘晓龙召集朱琳、于云刚、李涛、庞小斌、王建军等，在西安兴庆宫公园集会，策划新的阴谋，被公安干警当场抓获归案。
