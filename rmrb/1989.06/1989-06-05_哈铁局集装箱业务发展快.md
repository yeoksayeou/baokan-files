The Harbin Railway Bureau is actively developing international container transportation business, creating good social benefits. In the first four months of this year, it directly handled over 1,000 international containers for imports and exports, and transported over 30,000 tons of goods.

It is understood that in the past, most of China's imported and exported goods were packed or unpacked at the port, and then transported by rail in whole cars or in other ways, which not only easily caused damage or loss of goods, but also increased the cost for enterprises. In order to adapt to the development needs of China's import and export trade volume and international container transportation, the Harbin Railway Bureau has invested more than 100 million yuan since 1986 to establish international container receiving and dispatching bases in more than ten stations including Harbin, Mudanjiang, Qiqihar, and Jiamusi. By implementing container transportation, it has reduced the turnover of funds and goods, ensured the completion rate of goods transportation, and maintained the country's credibility.

　　哈铁局集装箱业务发展快
    新华社哈尔滨６月５日电  （通讯员梁维德、王楷）哈尔滨铁路局积极发展国际集装箱运输业务，创造了良好的社会效益。今年头４个月，直接办理进出口国际集装箱１０００多箱，接发货物３万多吨。
    据了解，过去我国进出口的货物大多是在口岸站装箱或拆箱，然后通过铁路整车或另担来回发运，这不仅容易造成货损货差，而且加大了企业的费用。哈尔滨铁路局为了适应我国进出口贸易运量和国际集装箱运输的发展需要，从１９８６年起已投资１亿多元，在哈尔滨、牡丹江、齐齐哈尔、佳木斯等十几个车站建立了国际集装箱接运基地，实行集装箱运输，减少了资金和货物的周转，确保了货物运输的完成率，维护了国家的信誉。
