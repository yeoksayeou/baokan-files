To ensure a bumper harvest, Hunan Province is making vigorous preparations for this year's flood season.

According to relevant provincial departments, Hunan may experience severe flooding across its rivers and lakes this year. On the other hand, the problem of siltation in Dongting Lake is becoming increasingly serious, with the lakebed rising continuously, and the levees' ability to withstand disasters failing to meet flood control needs. Of the 3,471 kilometers of levees along Dongting Lake, a significant portion does not meet the 1980 flood control standards, and 1,291 kilometers of critical sections urgently need reinforcement and repair.

In response to these issues, while establishing and improving the flood control responsibility system at all levels of government, Hunan is also working to implement engineering measures and secure flood control funds and materials. According to relevant departments, the hilly areas have addressed issues with 1,846 dangerous and problematic reservoirs. In the lake areas, 406 kilometers of flood control levees have been reinforced, 1,497 kilometers of inner lake levees and intermediate levees have been fortified, 22,500 electrical drainage and culvert facilities have been repaired, and 58 levee structures have been constructed or renovated.

    湖南省抓紧做好防汛准备
    本报长沙六月十六日电  记者吴兴华报道：为了确保农业丰收，湖南省努力做好今年的防汛准备工作。
    据省有关部门反映，湖南今年有可能发生全江全湖性大水。另一方面，洞庭湖泥沙问题越来越严重，湖底不断抬高，堤垸抗灾能力不适应防洪需要。洞庭湖三千四百七十一公里的临洪大堤，大部分未达到一九八○年的防洪标准，还有一千二百九十一公里的险工险段急待处理加固。
    针对上述情况，湖南在各地建立、健全各级政府主要负责人防汛责任制的同时，努力落实工程措施和防汛资金器材。据有关部门统计，山丘区先后处理险病水库一千八百四十六座，湖区已加固防洪大堤四百零六公里，加固内湖渍堤、间堤一千四百九十七公里，整修电排和涵闸设施二点二五万处，兴建、改建堤建筑物五十八处。
