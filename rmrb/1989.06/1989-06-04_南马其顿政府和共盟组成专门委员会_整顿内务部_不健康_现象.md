The Macedonian government and the League of Communists have formed a special committee to rectify "unhealthy" phenomena in the Ministry of Interior. Recently, the Minister of Interior and his assistant, A. Andonovsky and K. Kostanov, have resigned, and one deputy director has been dismissed. This is a move by the Macedonian government to rectify the "unhealthy" and "negative" phenomena within the Ministry of Interior.

According to reports, due to the incompetence and lack of vigilance of its leadership, they have come into conflict with the policies of the League of Communists, resulting in many "unhealthy" and "negative" phenomena in the work of the Macedonian Ministry of Interior. For example, some police officers waste state funds, misuse police cars for hunting or vacations, and waste ammunition without regret, even giving weapons to officials and their relatives. Some police stations even provide rest and other comfortable services for privileged "guests" after intense hunting activities.

In the implementation of cadre and housing policies, the Ministry of Interior also has many illegal phenomena. Some people who are not suitable for security work or have even engaged in hostile activities occupy very sensitive positions through connections, while ordinary job seekers without strong connections cannot even get in the door. An assistant minister has 17 family members working there.

In the Ministry of Interior, there are 353 police housing units that have not been registered and have been privately allocated to certain special individuals for residence, and so on.

These "unhealthy" and "negative" phenomena in the Macedonian Ministry of Interior have caused widespread dissatisfaction. The presidium of the basic organization of the League of Communists in the Ministry of Interior has proposed that some individuals should not only bear moral responsibility but also criminal responsibility. The party committee composed of members of the League of Communists in the Ministry of Interior and the government committee headed by the deputy prime minister of the republic have simultaneously begun to investigate these issues. The investigation work has received the support of the broad masses of the people of the Republic of Macedonia.

　　南马其顿政府和共盟组成专门委员会
    整顿内务部“不健康”现象
    本报贝尔格莱德６月３日电  记者严正报道：最近马其顿共和国内务部长及其助理阿·安多诺夫斯基和基·科什塔诺夫已辞去职务，１名副局长则被解职，这是马其顿政府为整顿内务部“不健康”现象采取的一个举动。
    据报道，由于其领导人员不谙业务、缺乏警惕性，他们与共盟政策发生冲突，以致造成马其顿内务部工作中许多“不健康”和“消极”的现象。例如有些警察浪费国家钱财，滥用警车去打猎或休假，毫不可惜地消耗弹药，把武器赠送给当官的和自己的亲友。有些警察局甚至专门为那些享有特权的“客人”在紧张的打猎活动后提供休息和其它舒适的服务。
    内务部在执行干部政策和住房政策方面，也有许多违反法律的现象。一些不适合搞安全工作甚至从事过敌对活动的人靠关系占据了非常敏感的工作岗位，而一般求职者因无过硬关系休想进入大门。１名部长助理竟有１７个家属在那里工作。
    在内务部有３５３套警察住房没有登记私自分给了某些特殊人员居住等等。
    马其顿内务部这些“不健康”的“消极”现象引起广泛不满，该部共盟基层组织代表大会主席团提出其中某些人员不但要承担道德上的而且还要承担刑事责任，由内务部共盟代表大会成员组成的党的委员会和以共和国副总理为首的政府的委员会已同时开始对其进行清查工作。清查工作得到了马其顿共和国广大人民群众的支持。
