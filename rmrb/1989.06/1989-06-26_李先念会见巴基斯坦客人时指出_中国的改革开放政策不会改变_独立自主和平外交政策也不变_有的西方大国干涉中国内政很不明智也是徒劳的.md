	Li Xiannian Meets with Pakistani Guests and States that China's Reform and Opening-Up Policy Will Not Change, Nor Will Its Independent and Peaceful Foreign Policy

	New China News Agency, Beijing, June 26 – Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference Li Xiannian this afternoon met with and hosted a banquet for the Pakistani Senate delegation led by Chairman Waseem Sajjad at the Diaoyutai State Guesthouse.

	In his remarks during the meeting and the banquet, Li Xiannian pointed out that the essence of the counter-revolutionary riots in Beijing was to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China and to subvert the socialist People's Republic of China.

	He said, the Chinese government took decisive measures to quell the riots in order to restore social order and stability, to safeguard the security of the state and the people, and to ensure the smooth progress of economic construction and reform and opening-up.

	He said, China's reform and opening-up policy will not change, and China's independent and peaceful foreign policy will not change either. China will, as always, adhere to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence to further develop friendly relations with all countries in the world and to further develop economic and cultural exchanges with foreign countries. The Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference will, as always, actively carry out people's diplomacy, develop ties and cooperation with friendly countries and organizations, and jointly safeguard world peace. He said, "Our attitude is consistent and sincere."

	Li Xiannian said, now some Western powers are pointing fingers and trying to exert political and economic pressure on China, interfering in China's internal affairs. The Chinese government and people are firmly opposed to this. Their actions are unwise and futile.

	Li Xiannian said, the friendship and affection between the peoples of China and Pakistan have stood the test of history. Chairman Waseem Sajjad's visit will surely promote the traditional friendship between the two countries.

	Chairman Waseem Sajjad said in his remarks that he came this time to express support to the Chinese people. He said, Pakistan hopes to see a strong China and believes that China can solve its own problems without external interference.

	Sajjad said in his banquet speech, Pakistan has noted the normalization of Sino-Soviet relations, the easing of tensions in South Asia, the Soviet withdrawal from Afghanistan, and the progress on the Cambodian issue. However, despite these or that progress, the final resolution of regional conflicts and the attainment of complete peace in these regions still face substantial obstacles.

	Chairman Waseem Sajjad arrived in Beijing yesterday at the invitation of Chairman Li Xiannian. The Pakistani guests will also visit Xi'an, Guilin, and Kunming.

　　李先念会见巴基斯坦客人时指出     
    中国的改革开放政策不会改变  独立自主和平外交政策也不变    
    有的西方大国干涉中国内政很不明智也是徒劳的
    新华社北京６月２６日电　全国政协主席李先念今天下午在钓鱼台国宾馆会见并宴请了由瓦西姆·萨贾德主席率领的巴基斯坦参议院访华代表团。
    李先念在会见时和宴会致辞中均指出，在北京发生的反革命暴乱的实质就是推翻中国共产党的领导，颠覆社会主义的中华人民共和国。
    他说，中国政府采取坚决措施平息暴乱，是为了恢复社会秩序的稳定，保障国家和人民的安全，使经济建设和改革开放得以顺利进行。
    他说，中国的改革开放政策不会改变，中国独立自主的和平外交政策也不会改变。中国将一如既往地按照和平共处五项原则，进一步发展同世界各国的友好关系，进一步发展同外国的经济、文化交流。中国人民政治协商会议将一如既往地积极开展人民外交，发展同友好国家、友好组织的联系和合作，共同维护世界和平。他说，“我们的这种态度是一贯的，是真诚的。”
    李先念说，现在有的西方大国在那里指手划脚，试图在政治上和经济上对中国施加压力，干涉中国的内政。对此，中国政府和中国人民是坚决反对的。他们这样做是很不明智的，也是徒劳的。
    李先念说，中巴两国人民的友谊和感情是经过历史考验的。瓦西姆·萨贾德主席的来访一定会使中巴两国人民之间的传统友谊得到更好的发展。
    瓦西姆·萨贾德主席在会见时说，他这次来访是为了向中国人民表示支持。他说，巴基斯坦希望看到一个强大的中国，并相信中国能在没有外来干涉的情况下解决自己的问题。
    萨贾德在宴会致辞中说，巴基斯坦注意到中苏关系正常化和南亚次大陆缓和迹象、苏联从阿富汗撤军以及柬埔寨问题的进展。但是，尽管有了这样或那样的进展，地区冲突的最后解决和在这些地区获得完全和平仍存在实质性障碍。
    瓦西姆·萨贾德主席是应李先念主席的邀请于昨天抵达北京的。巴基斯坦客人还将到西安、桂林和昆明参观访问。
