The 26-kilometer-long flood control embankment along the Songhua River in Harbin city has undergone comprehensive improvements. The flood control standard has been raised from withstanding a once-in-40-years flood to defending against a once-in-a-century major flood, meeting the national standard for large city embankments. Additionally, the riverbank, road, and park are integrated into one, becoming another scenic spot for the public to enjoy.
