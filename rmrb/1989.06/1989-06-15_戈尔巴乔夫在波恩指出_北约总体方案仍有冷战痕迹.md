Gorbachev Points Out in Bonn: NATO's Overall Plan Still Bears Traces of the Cold War

Xinhua News Agency, Bonn, June 15th. Reporter Jiang Jian Guo reports: Soviet leader Gorbachev criticized NATO's recently adopted overall plan at a press conference here today, stating that it still bears traces of the Cold War. He said that NATO has yet to abandon its nuclear deterrence strategy, which is regrettable in an era when the world and Europe are moving towards détente. However, he added that despite this, arms reduction can still achieve results.

Regarding the issue of arms reduction, he said that whether the negotiations on conventional arms reduction and the reduction of short-range nuclear missiles will proceed in parallel, this cannot be determined by the timetable set by the United States and the Soviet Union alone. It depends on the progress of global and European arms reduction and the will of the European people, of course, the Soviet Union and the United States should consider this.

When asked about German reunification, Gorbachev said that the current situation in Europe is a reality formed after the war. On this basis, the process of European security and cooperation is developing. He hopes this process will bring more benefits to Europe. He welcomed the statements from both Germanys that war will never again be waged from German soil.

He also said that the Berlin Wall is not the only obstacle to building a European house. Many conditions still need to be created for equal cooperation. The Berlin Wall was built under certain conditions, and if the conditions that led to its construction no longer exist, the Berlin Wall will disappear. He does not consider the Berlin Wall to be a major problem.

When asked whether the joint statement mentions that the United States and Canada have a place in the European house, whether they should still station troops in Europe, Gorbachev replied that no country should station troops on another country's territory. If the military confrontation in Europe is not eliminated, it is difficult to imagine a stable European house being built. At the same time, he said that he does not think it is a realistic policy to restrict American interests; people should start from reality.

At the press conference, Gorbachev also praised the Soviet-West German joint statement as a rare document that reflects "new thinking." He said that the Soviet Union will continue to move forward, steadily and realistically carrying out solid reforms, and there is no question of retreating.

　　戈尔巴乔夫在波恩指出
    北约总体方案仍有冷战痕迹
    本报波恩６月１５日电  记者江建国报道：苏联领导人戈尔巴乔夫今天在这里的记者招待会上批评北约最近通过的总体方案仍然带有冷战的痕迹。他说，北约迄今不放弃核威慑战略，在全世界都走向缓和的时代这是令人十分遗憾的。但尽管如此，裁军仍然可能继续取得成果。
    在谈到裁军问题时，他说，关于常规裁军和短程核导弹裁减两场谈判是否会平行进行，这一点不能由美苏两家来确定时间表，它取决于世界和欧洲的裁军进程和欧洲人民的意愿，当然苏美两国要考虑这一点。
    在回答有关德国统一的提问时，戈尔巴乔夫说，欧洲今天的状况是战后形成的现实，在这一现实的基础上欧洲安全和合作的进程在发展。他希望这一进程会为欧洲带来更多的益处。他对两个德国都表示战争永不再从德国的土地上发生表示欢迎。
    他还说，柏林墙并不是建立欧洲大厦的唯一障碍，为了进行平等的合作还需要创造许多条件。柏林墙是在某种条件下建起来的，如果导致建墙的条件不再存在，柏林墙就会消失。他不认为柏林墙是个很大的问题。
    有记者问到，联合声明说美国和加拿大在欧洲大厦中占有位置，那么它们是否还应在欧洲驻军？戈尔巴乔夫回答说，任何国家都不应在他国领土上派驻军队。如果不消除欧洲的军事对峙，很难设想会建起一座稳固的欧洲大厦。他同时又说，他认为限制美国利益不是一种现实政策，人们应从现实出发。
    在记者招待会上，戈尔巴乔夫还称赞苏联西德联合声明是一个少有的文件，反映了“新思维”。他还说，苏联将继续前进，稳步现实地进行扎实的改革，不存在后退问题。
