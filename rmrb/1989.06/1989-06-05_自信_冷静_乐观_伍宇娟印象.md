	Confidence, Calmness, Optimism
	– Impressions of Wu Yujuan
	Qian Le

	Some say that there are many new faces in the film industry today, but few leave a lasting impression. Wu Yujuan is an exception.

	She studies at the acting department of the Central Academy of Drama and plays the female lead, Qingqing, in the film "The Madness of Price." This girl from the banks of the Xiangjiang River has played several roles in films during her studies. Qingqing is her last role as a student and her first important role on the silver screen.

	Wu Yujuan is warm-hearted, simple, and cheerful; Qingqing is stern, aloof, and intense. To play such a role, which is so different from her own personality, and to do so without any similar life experiences to draw upon, Wu Yujuan's ability to accurately portray the various characteristics of a kind-hearted psychopath is truly commendable.

	She is confident. After the film's release, Wu Yujuan began to attract attention from within and outside the film industry. Faced with the various comments, she seems both serious and happy. Tasting success for the first time is indeed an intoxicating experience. However, she also has her complaints: a few reports referred to her as "Gong Li's classmate." In her view, she can earn her fame through her own abilities and does not want to rely on someone else's reputation to boost her own. "I am very confident," she says.

	She is calm. Confidence after success is natural, but calmness after success is rare.

	What she is most pleased about is that her acting skills have been recognized. When the film was screened at her school, the usually critical "professional" audience gave her a standing ovation. Her male classmates also showed their respect with a "surrounding" approach. Most of the reviews in the newspapers also considered her performance a success.

	All of this brings her joy, but it has not made her lose her calm. She looks forward to hearing all kinds of reactions, especially from professionals, because this can benefit her more. At the same time, she also rationally protects the reputation she has earned through her outstanding performance. Recently, several directors have come to invite her to act in their films, some hinting in strange tones that there would be "those kinds" of scenes. She has refused all such invitations. "I don't want to become famous through these means," she says with a hint of sadness.

	She is optimistic. Although life is full of ups and downs, she maintains an optimistic attitude towards life. "I love life," you can taste her genuine enthusiasm for life from her tone, not just empty words.

	She and Qingqing are indeed two completely different types of people. She is full of confidence for the future. "I like my acting major, and I am willing to develop my strengths. After graduation, it would be ideal to join a drama troupe and become an actor," she says to her friends.

	Now, she is writing her graduation thesis, using Freudian theories to explore issues in acting theory. She is very confident about completing this thesis.

	I hope that in 20 years, she will still be as confident, calm, and optimistic.

### 自信·冷静·乐观——伍宇娟印象

　　自信·冷静·乐观
    ——伍宇娟印象
    千了
    有人说，时下影坛新人不少，可是给人留下印象的不多。伍宇娟是个例外。
    她在中央戏剧学院表演系学习，在影片《疯狂的代价》中扮演女主角青青。这位来自湘江之畔的姑娘，学习期间曾先后在几部影片里担任角色。青青是她学生时代最后一个，也是表演生涯第一个重要银幕角色。
    伍宇娟热情、淳朴、愉快；青青严厉、孤僻、激烈。饰演这样一个与本色相去甚远的角色，又是在不可能有相似生活经历可资体验的情况下，伍宇娟能准确地表现一个善良的心理变态者的种种性格特征，颇为难能可贵。
    她自信。这部影片上映后，伍宇娟开始受到影坛内外的注意。面对纷至沓来的各式评论，她显得既认真又开心。初尝成功味道毕竟是种醉人的经历。然而她也有不满：有几篇报道提到她时，都以“巩俐同学”相称。在她看来，她完全可以自己的能力赢得名声；并不想靠别人的名气来提高自己的知名度。“我是很自信的。”她说。
    她冷静。成功后的自信是必然的，成功后的冷静则很难得。
    她最感欣慰的是自己的演技得到了肯定。片子拿到学校试演时，一向善于挑剔的“专业”观众们居然给了她一个满堂彩。同班男生们也用“围攻”的方式刮目相待。见诸报端的评论大都认为她的表演是成功的。
    这一切给她带来喜悦，然而并未使她失去冷静。她渴望听到各式各样的反应，特别是行家的意见，因为这可使她获益更多。同时，她也很理智地保护由于表演出色而赢得的声誉。近来，一些导演纷纷上门邀她拍片，有的用异样的口吻暗示，片中将有“那种”镜头。对此类邀请，她一律回绝。“我不靠这些出名。”百感之余，她也有一丝忧郁。
    她乐观。尽管生活中少不了七七八八的事情，可是她对生活抱乐观态度。“我热爱生活。”从语调中，你品味到的不是附庸风雅的陈辞，而是一个青年人对生活的渴望。
    她与青青确实是截然不同两类人。她对未来充满信心。“我喜欢我的表演专业，我愿意发挥自己的专长，毕业后能进话剧团当演员是比较理想的。”她对她的朋友们这样说。
    现在，她正在写她的毕业论文，运用弗洛伊德的学说来探讨表演理论问题。对完成这篇论文她很有把握。
    但愿２０年后她依然这样自信，冷静和乐观。
