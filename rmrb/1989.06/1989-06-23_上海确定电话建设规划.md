Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, June 22nd.

Shanghai has determined a medium and long-term telephone construction plan: by the year 2000, the total number of telephones in the urban area will reach 1.6 to 2 million units, with a telephone penetration rate of approximately 25%.

By the end of 1988, the telephone exchange capacity in Shanghai had reached 387,000 lines, an increase of 2.28 times compared to 1979.

The main contents of Shanghai's medium and long-term telephone construction plan include:

- Transitioning from small-capacity to large-capacity systems. By 1995, the city will initially establish a network of 1 million digital and analog telephone exchange equipment; by 2000, a network primarily consisting of digital telephone exchange equipment will be built, with a capacity of 1.6 to 2 million lines; by 2020, the city's telephone exchange capacity will reach 4 million lines.

- Transitioning from a network based on administrative divisions to a unified local network. Within the city's 6,100 square kilometers, urban and suburban telephone communications will form a unified local network, with the entire network achieving automation.

- Transitioning from a simple telephone network to an integrated digital communication network.

　　上海确定电话建设规划
    新华社上海６月２２日电（记者冯亦珍）上海确定中远期电话建设规划：到２０００年，市区电话机总数将达到１６０万至２００万部，电话普及率约２５％。
    到１９８８年底，上海市电话交换机容量已达３８．７万门，比１９７９年增加了２．２８倍。
    上海中远期电话建设规划主要内容包括：
    ——由小容量向大容量发展。１９９５年前，全市初步建成１００万门数字和模拟电话交换设备网；到２０００年，建成以数字电话交换设备为主的网，容量达１６０万至２００万门；到２０２０年，全市达到４００万门电话交换容量。
    ——从以行政区划为主的局部网向统一的本地网发展。在全市６１００平方公里内，市内、郊县的电话通信将组成统一的本地网，全网实现自动化。
    ——从单纯的电话网向综合业务数字通信网发展。
