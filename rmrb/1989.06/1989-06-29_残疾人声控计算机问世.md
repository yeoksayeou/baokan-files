Voice-Controlled Computer for the Disabled Debuts

	BEIJING, June 29 (Xinhua) -- A voice-controlled personal computer system designed specifically for the disabled has been successfully developed. The system allows users to issue commands to the computer through a microphone, and the computer executes these commands and confirms them via a speaker. This innovative system was jointly developed by the Italian Association for the Disabled's Dattarco Group and the Industrial Union of Turin.

	The voice-controlled computer system can recognize and remember approximately 400 words and phrases commonly used by the user, with an error rate of less than 2%. It can receive commands to turn lights or household appliances on or off, open doors, use telephones or televisions, and even operate wheelchairs for the disabled.

　　残疾人声控计算机问世
    本报罗马电  记者罗晋标报道：通过一个话筒，以声音直接向电子计算机发出指令，电子计算机执行指令并通过一个喇叭加以确认。这是专为残疾人使用的一种声控个人电子计算机系统，最近由意大利残疾人协会达塔尔克小组与都灵市工业联合会合作研制成功。
    这种声控电子计算机系统的程序能识别惯常使用者的声音，记忆约４００个单词和短语，其错误系数低于２％。它能接受使用者的指令而开关电灯或家用电器、开门、使用电话机或电视机。它还可以操作残疾人的轮椅。
