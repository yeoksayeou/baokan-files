Scribbling
Tǔ Lā

A letter of admission brought me into the gates of the Wuhan Normal School for Early Childhood Education in Hubei Province. Little did I expect that the first lesson I attended at the school would lead my thoughts and vision into a brand new world.

It was an art class. The teacher introduced us to the history of art, saying, "...when children draw, it is called scribbling; the period when children draw is called the scribbling period. Can any of you explain what 'scribbling' means?"

The entire classroom was as quiet as a pond in spring, and you could even hear the breathing of the person next to you.

The teacher was flipping through the new student roster, and it seemed she was about to call on someone to answer.

"Tǔ Lā, please explain what 'scribbling' means."

Before I could stand up, the classroom erupted in laughter: "Ha ha! Tǔ Lā—scribbling," "He he! Scribbling—Tǔ Lā...".

I never imagined that the homophone of these two characters would lead to such a lively scene! My mind was in turmoil: I was most afraid of being given a nickname. This was my first day at the normal school!

The teacher used a strong gesture to quell the laughter. Facing the teacher's expectant gaze and the friendly smiles of my classmates, I gained a bit more courage. I had to answer.

Initially, applying to the normal school was my first choice. My middle school principal praised my decision to apply to the normal school, writing in the comments that I "was deeply influenced by my family's education (I come from a 'family of educators') and possessed the basic qualities of an early childhood educator." I remember that when I was filling out my first choice under the lamp, I hesitated a bit. Because I loved literature, I always wanted to go to university and dreamed of becoming a writer after graduation, never thinking of becoming a "child king." My parents, sitting next to me, kept urging me to fill out the form for the normal school. Mother said, "When you truly understand the work of early childhood education, you will love it!" Father said, "Going to university means you can become a writer? Nonsense! Writers are people with a particularly strong sense of social responsibility. Look, our nation is about to enter the 21st century with the heavy burden of 229 million illiterates. If you still don't feel the importance of early childhood education, it shows you lack the most basic quality of a writer! Fill it out, it's correct!" So I made up my mind.

"Now, please listen to Tǔ Lā explain 'scribbling,'" the teacher urged.

" 'Scribbling,' " I replied, "is a humble term, originating from two lines in Lu Tong's 'Poem on Adding a Child' from the Tang Dynasty: 'Suddenly, ink is spilled on the desk, scribbling poems and books like an old crow.' It is used to describe writing poorly and later was used to describe children drawing..."

The classmates listened and lowered their heads in thought. The teacher's eyes shone brightly, and she immediately asked with a double meaning, "Tǔ Lā, are you interested in 'scribbling'?"

My mind went blank. How should I answer? To be honest, I didn't like it before because I didn't understand it; later, I began to understand it a bit, thanks to the days when I filled out the application form. My parents, to help me establish a firm professional ideology, often instilled in me ideas like "young people should have a sense of historical mission" and "you should have a sense of social responsibility," truly opening my mind. So now? I thought of yesterday when I reported to the school and visited the classrooms of the senior students. The white walls were adorned with exquisite decorations; the blackboard newspapers were colorful and elegant, with a girlish spirit in every word. On each desk were many exquisite handicrafts: puppets, lanterns, dolls, paper cuts; on the window sills were displayed sculptures of various poses and lifelike forms made of plaster and clay. A few students were carefully refining their works. "Do you like it?" one of them asked me. I nodded, and she smiled, seemingly with endless feelings, saying, "These are the results of our years of 'scribbling,' all for the sake of guiding children to 'scribble' in the future. Don't underestimate it, it's not easy. The colorful life of the normal school will help you understand everything!" Her words were somewhat incomprehensible to me, but I vaguely felt that I had already fallen in love with this school.

At this moment, I noticed that my classmates were all looking at me with eager eyes. Finally, I thought of six sentences:

"In a country of illiterates, it is impossible to build socialism. A child influenced by poor education is like a lost child. Knowledge is the lamp that guides life to the realm of light and truth. Therefore, education is an inexpensive defense. The roots of education are bitter, but its fruits are sweet. I, Tǔ Lā, have come from the scribbling period! The roots of education are my roots!"

The classroom erupted in enthusiastic applause. My seatmate quietly asked me, "Wow, a series of aphorisms, how did you come up with them?" I quietly told her, "Five-sixths of it is quoted. The first sentence is by Lenin of the Soviet Union, the second by Kennedy of the United States, the third by Li Dazhao of China, the fourth by Aristotle of Greece, the fifth by J.P. Jones, and the last sentence is mine."

"Well said, scribbling!"

The teacher was talking on the podium, and my thoughts were drifting with her words. I felt that I had already entered a completely new realm.

New life begins here...

专栏：

　　涂鸦
    涂拉
    一纸录取通知单把我带进了湖北省武昌幼儿师范学校的大门。没想到进入幼师的第一节课竟把我的思想、视野引入了一个崭新的世界。
    那是一节美术课。老师向我们介绍美术史，说：“……幼儿画画，称作涂鸦；幼儿作画的时期，称作涂鸦时期。哪位同学能够解释一下，什么叫涂鸦吗？”
    整个教室安静得像一池春水，甚至于能感觉到邻座的呼吸声。
    老师正在翻阅新生点名册，看样子她要点名提问了。
    “涂拉同学，请你解释一下什么叫‘涂鸦’。”
    还没等我站立起来，满堂“咯咯咯”的笑声便把我包围了：“哈哈！涂拉——涂鸦”“嘻嘻！涂鸦——涂拉……”。
    真没想到这两个字的谐音竟然会引出如此热闹的场面！我心里乱腾腾的：我最怕别人起外号。这可是我进入中师生活的第一天呀！
    老师用强烈的手势把笑声压了下去。我面对老师期待的目光，同学们友爱的笑容，平添了几分勇气，我必须作出回答。
    当初报考幼师是我的第一志愿。初中的班主任对我报考幼师表示赞赏，在评语中说我“受家庭教育影响较深（我出身于“师范世家”），具备幼儿教育工作者的基本素质。”记得当时在灯下填写第一志愿时，我还有些犹豫。因为我爱好文学，总想上大学，幻想毕业后当作家，从没想过去当“孩子王”。坐在我身边的爸爸妈妈一个劲儿地催促我下笔填报幼师。妈妈说：“当你真正理解了幼教工作，你会爱上它的！”爸爸说：“上了大学就能当作家？笑话！作家是属于社会责任感特别强的人。眼看我们的民族将要驮着２．２９亿文盲的沉重包袱进入２１世纪，如果你还不感到幼教工作的重要，就说明你缺乏作家的最基本的素质！填吧，没错！”于是我下了决心。
    “现在请听涂拉同学解释‘涂鸦’。”老师在催促。
    “所谓‘涂鸦’，”我回答道，“它是一个谦词，出自唐朝卢仝写的《添丁诗》里的两句话，‘忽来案上翻墨汁，涂抹诗书如老鸦’。它用来形容写得很不好，后又用来形容幼儿画画……”
    同学们听了各有所思地低下了头。老师听了，眼睛闪着亮光，紧接着一语双关地问道：“涂拉同学，你对‘涂鸦’感兴趣吗？”
    我脑子里“嗡”的一声。该怎么回答？老实说，我原先并不喜欢，因为我不理解它；后来呢，有些理解了，那得归功于填报志愿书的那段日子里，爸爸妈妈为了帮助我树立牢固的专业思想，经常对我灌输什么年轻人“要有历史使命感”呀，“要有社会责任心”呀，真使我茅塞大开。那么现在呢？我想起昨天我到校报到时，参观了高年级同学的教室。雪白的墙上点缀着精美的装饰品；黑板报色彩绚丽，文笔清秀，字里行间透出一股少女的灵气。每一张课桌上都摆着许多精致的手工艺品：木偶、宫灯、布娃娃、剪纸；窗台上陈列着姿态各异、神形兼备的石膏像，泥巴雕塑。有几位同学正在精心修饰她们的作品。“你喜欢吗？”其中一位问我。我点头，她笑了，仿佛无限感慨地说：“这些都是我们多年‘涂鸦’的成果，为的是将来去引导幼儿们‘涂鸦’。你莫小看它，很不容易的。多彩的幼师生活会帮助你了解一切！”她的话我似懂非懂，但我隐约感到自己已爱上了这个学校。
    这时，我发觉同学们都在用热切的目光期待着我，终于，我想到了六句话：
    “在一个文盲的国家里是不能建成社会主义的。一个受了不良教育影响的孩童等于走失了方向。知识才是引导人生到光明与真实境界的灯烛。所以教育是廉价的国防。教育的根是苦的，但它的果是甜的。我涂拉就是从涂鸦时期走过来的呀！教育的根就是我的根！”
    满堂的热烈掌声。同座悄悄地问我：“好家伙，一系列的警句，你是怎么想出来的？”我也悄悄地告诉她：“有六分之五是引用的。第一句是苏联列宁说的，第二句是美国肯尼迪说的，第三句是中国李大钊说的，第四句是希腊亚里斯多德说的，第五句是Ｊ·Ｐ·逊说的，最后一句才是我说的。”
    “好一个涂鸦！”
    老师在讲台上侃侃而谈，我的思绪随着她的语言飘忽不定，我感到自己已进入了一个全新的境界。
    新生活从这里开始……
