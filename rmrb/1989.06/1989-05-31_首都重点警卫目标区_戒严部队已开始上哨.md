Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, May 31st.

Troops under martial law have begun patrolling key areas in the capital. Soldiers assigned to guard over a dozen key locations in Beijing have started their duties in uniform. These units arrived on May 21st and are stationed at key sites such as the Beijing Capital International Airport, Beijing Railway Station, and the Telegraph Building.

At Beijing Railway Station, the previous chaotic scenes have disappeared. Inside the Telegraph Building, the telecommunications system is operating normally.

Colonel Liu Yinsheng, commander of the unit responsible for martial law duties at Beijing Railway Station, told reporters that since the troops arrived, they have helped the station manage and transport over 100,000 students returning to their schools, expedited the delivery of 25,000 backlogged mail and newspapers, assisted public security officers in processing over 250 individuals impersonating university students, and helped the station restore normal operations.

A leader of the martial law troops told reporters, "Some people in society have mistakenly referred to the military's execution of martial law as 'military control.' This is completely wrong. 'Military control' refers to military personnel taking over the functions of local government departments. Our primary task in implementing martial law in the capital's key areas is to assist the People's Armed Police in ensuring the safety of important national departments and achieving absolute security."

The soldiers tasked with martial law duties at these key locations have won the understanding and support of the local populace through their exemplary conduct. In recent days, many residents have voluntarily provided water and food to the stationed soldiers, vacated rooms for them, and helped the military resolve various living difficulties.

### 首都重点警卫目标区  戒严部队已开始上哨

　　首都重点警卫目标区
    戒严部队已开始上哨
    新华社北京５月３１日电  进驻首都重点警卫目标区的戒严部队官兵近日开始着装上哨。
    肩负首都１０多个重点目标警卫任务的官兵是５月２１日陆续进驻的。进驻的单位包括首都机场、北京火车站、电报大楼等。
    在北京火车站，前几天那种混乱现象不见了；电报大楼里，电讯通信系统正在正常运转。
    担负北京火车站戒严任务的某部团长刘寅生上校告诉记者，部队进驻后，主动协助车站疏导、输送１０余万外地学生离京返校，抢运积压邮件、报纸２５０００余件，协助公安干警对２５０多名冒充大学生的社会闲杂人员进行了查处，协助车站恢复正常的工作秩序。
    戒严部队一位领导同志对记者说，现在社会上一些人将解放军执行“戒严”任务说成是“军管”，这是非常错误的。所谓“军管”，是指军队干部将地方部门的权力接管过来。这次我们对首都重要目标实行戒严的主要任务，是协助武警部队确保国家重要部门的安全，做到万无一失。
    担负这些重点警卫目标戒严任务的官兵以自己的模范行动赢得了所在单位群众的理解和支持。连日来，不少群众主动为进驻部队官兵送水送饭，腾房让房，帮助解放军解决了许多生活上的困难。
