	Guangdong province has made significant progress in addressing the drinking water difficulties faced by residents in old revolutionary areas, minority regions, and remote mountain areas. Over the past three years, the province has constructed over 3,000 water supply projects, including reservoirs, pumping stations, and water diversion systems. As a result, the drinking water issues for 1.1 million people have been resolved, accounting for more than 70% of the total number of people who needed this help.

	Originally, 1.8 million people in rural Guangdong faced drinking water difficulties. These individuals are spread across more than 60 counties and cities, with a significant concentration in old revolutionary areas, minority regions, and remote mountain areas. In 1984, the Guangdong Provincial People's Congress, during its sixth session, listed solving these drinking water difficulties as its top priority. Subsequently, various levels of government formulated specific plans to address the drinking water issues by 1990. Departments such as planning, finance, water resources, and materials worked closely together to secure funding and allocate materials. The province has raised over 87 million yuan and allocated more than 4,200 tons of steel and 20,000 tons of cement for water supply projects, helping to resolve the drinking water difficulties for these residents.

　　广东百万人饮水不再难
    新华社广州６月１５日电  （通讯员孙国惠）广东省各级人民政府把解决老少边区群众的饮水难问题当作一件大事来抓，取得初步成果。
    近三年，全省共修建蓄、提、引等各类型饮水工程３０００多处，已有１１０万人的饮水难问题得到解决，占应解决饮水困难总人数的七成以上。
    广东农村原有１８０多万人存在饮水难问题。这些人分布在全省６０多个县、市，其中又大部分集中在革命老区、少数民族地区和边远山区。１９８４年广东省人大六届二次会议把解决这些群众饮水难问题列为第一议案，各级政府随之制订出１９９０年以前解决群众饮用水难的具体规划。各地计划、财政、水利、物资等部门密切配合，筹措资金，调拨物资。全省先后筹集８７００多万元，调拨４２００多吨钢材和两万多吨水泥用于饮用水工程，帮助群众解决饮水难问题。
