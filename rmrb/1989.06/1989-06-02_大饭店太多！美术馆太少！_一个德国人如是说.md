A visitor from West Germany, upon discussing his impressions of China, expressed bewilderment at the sheer number and opulence of hotels and restaurants in Beijing, while noting the scarcity and poor condition of art galleries. He stayed at the Great Wall Hotel and remarked, "The suite I'm staying in could easily accommodate 20 people, but it's just me. Then look at your art galleries—there's only one, and it's in such poor shape. How can you display art in a place like that?"

The gentleman is named Buchhain, a renowned writer and painter from West Germany, and also a collector of numerous artworks. He traveled from Bavaria to Beijing with the purpose of exploring the feasibility of hosting an exhibition of German Expressionist paintings. Upon arriving in Beijing, he immediately began inspecting potential venues for the exhibition. The China Art Gallery left him deeply disappointed. The equipment in the exhibition halls was rudimentary, and what he found most incomprehensible was the apparent lack of management. His accompanying personnel explained the limited financial resources and other objective conditions, but he believed that not all problems could be attributed to money. "Sweeping away the dirty sawdust and moving the broken wooden crates doesn't require much money!" When he heard that China was still a developing country, he said, "No, China is not a developing country. China's advanced culture and arts are not those of a developing country..." He wondered how a country with such a rich artistic heritage could tolerate a situation where there are only luxury hotels and no art galleries.

### “大饭店太多！美术馆太少！”——一个德国人如是说

　　“大饭店太多！美术馆太少！”
    ——一个德国人如是说
    一个来自联邦德国的客人，谈到访华观感，他大惑不解的是北京竟然有这么多、这么豪华的旅馆、饭店，而美术馆竟然如此少，如此寒伧。他住在长城饭店，他说：“我住的那套房间足足住得下２０个人，但只有我一个人住。再看看你们的美术馆，只有一个而且太糟。那样的地方怎么能陈列美术作品？”
    这位老人叫布赫哈因，是联邦德国著名作家，又是画家，还收藏了大量美术作品。他从巴伐利亚专程来北京的目的是寻求在北京举办德国表现主义绘画展览的可行性。他一到北京，便四出巡视可以举办画展的地方，中国美术馆使他大失所望。展厅设备的简陋就不要说了，他最难以理解的是似乎无人管理。陪同人员向他解释了我们财力有限等等客观条件，但他认为，不能把一切问题都归结到钱上去。“扫掉那些脏的锯末，搬走那些破烂的木箱，并不需要什么钱！”当他听到中国还是一个发展中国家时，他说“不，中国不是发展中国家，中国高超的文化艺术不是发展中国家的文化艺术……”他奇怪的是具有如此丰富艺术宝藏的中国，怎么能容忍只有大饭店而没有美术馆的局面。　　　（原载《中国艺术报》）
