    Recently, a case involving a deputy town head raping a young girl occurred in Qingzhou City, Shandong Province. Subsequently, threats, intimidation, bribery of the victim, and promises to intercede emerged, affecting the normal operation of judicial authorities.

    On April 21, the deputy town head of Wangfen Town, Qingzhou City, Li Lündù, raped a 16-year-old female employee of a certain restaurant. The public security authorities arrested Li Lündù on the same day. However, five days later, just as the procuratorate was about to approve Li's arrest, the victim suddenly retracted her statement. This left the judicial authorities in a difficult position, and the public was abuzz with discussions.

    It turned out that after the case involving Li Lündù was exposed, his relatives, comrades-in-arms, classmates, and friends all took action. They quickly formed a network of connections through acquaintances to defend and intercede for Li Lündù, attempting to bribe and intimidate the plaintiff and her relatives.

    Under these circumstances, the municipal disciplinary committee and other departments formed a special team to investigate the case. They quickly clarified the facts and, in conjunction with the judicial authorities, punished those involved in interceding: the public security bureau imposed a 15-day administrative detention on Li Changfu, the director of an auto repair shop who had bribed and coerced the victim; the disciplinary committee will impose disciplinary actions on two party members and issue a notice to the entire city.

　　副镇长强奸案发  说情者纷至沓来
    本报讯  前不久，一起副镇长强奸少女案在山东省青州市发生后，随之出现了威胁、恐吓、利诱受害者和许愿说情等，影响司法部门正常办案。
    ４月２１日，青州市王坟镇副镇长李伦笃强奸了某饭店１６岁的女营业员，公安机关当天将李伦笃抓获归案。但时隔５天，在检察机关将要批准逮捕李时，却突然接到了被害者的反供信。一时间，使司法部门骑虎难下，群众议论纷纷。
    原来，李伦笃案发后，他的亲戚、战友、同学、朋友等纷纷出动，还通过熟人托关系迅速结成关系网，为李伦笃辩解说情，利诱和威胁原告人及其亲戚。
    在此情况下，市纪委等部门专门组成班子，立案调查，很快查明事实真相，并会同司法部门对参与说情者做出惩处：公安局对利诱胁迫受害人的汽修厂厂长李长富，给予治安拘留１５天的处罚；纪委对两名党员干部将做出党纪处分，并通报全市。
