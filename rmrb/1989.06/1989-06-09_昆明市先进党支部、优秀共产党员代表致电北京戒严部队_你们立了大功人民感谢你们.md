Representatives of Advanced Party Branches and Outstanding Communist Party Members in Kunming Send a Telegram to the Beijing Martial Law Troops

You Have Achieved Great Success, the People Thank You

	Beijing, June 8 (Xinhua) — The Martial Law Command received a telegram from representatives of advanced party branches and outstanding Communist Party members in Kunming, extending their greetings to the martial law troops. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

	Dear Comrades of the People's Liberation Army, Public Security Officers, and Armed Police Executing Martial Law:

	You have worked hard! First of all, let us, on behalf of all Communist Party members in Kunming, extend our warm congratulations to you for your great victory in suppressing the shocking counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital and restoring normal order in the capital! We express our heartfelt gratitude for the immortal merits you have established in defending the socialist system, the people's government, and the interests of the country and the people!

	Since the early hours of June 3, a small group of heartless and insane rioters in our great capital, Beijing, created a serious counter-revolutionary rebellion. They illegally set up barricades, looted weapons, burned military vehicles, and wantonly attacked, beat, kidnapped, and killed soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. Their purpose in carrying out the counter-revolutionary rebellion was to oppose the Party's leadership, deny the socialist system, and overthrow the People's Republic of China. We express our utmost indignation and hatred for the counter-revolutionary actions of these rioters. In the face of this grave situation, the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission made a decisive decision, and the martial law troops took resolute measures to crush this counter-revolutionary rebellion. We firmly support this wise decision by the Central Committee.

	In the past few days, in the process of suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, you have resolutely carried out the sacred martial law mission. On your way to the front, despite being subjected to the rioters' vicious insults, inhuman beatings, and illegal kidnappings, you have shouldered the heavy responsibility entrusted by the Party and the people. You have carried forward the five revolutionary spirits advocated by Chairman Deng, fought bravely and tenaciously, and dealt a heavy blow to the counter-revolutionary arrogance of the gang of rioters. You have proven with your loyalty and blood that you are indeed the brave sons and daughters of the people under the leadership of the Party, the steadfast guardians of the state and the people, and the strong pillars of the people's democratic dictatorship. We believe that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, you will surely continue to rely on the broad masses of the people and students in Beijing, carry forward the spirit of revolutionary heroism that fears neither hardship nor sacrifice, and resolutely and thoroughly suppress this counter-revolutionary rebellion, writing a new chapter of heroism.

	The 130,000 Communist Party members in the spring city of Kunming, on the southwestern border of our motherland, in the face of this struggle concerning the future of the Party and the state, must resolutely defend the leadership of the Party Central Committee, resolutely defend the socialist system and people's democratic dictatorship, and fully play the vanguard and exemplary role in their respective posts. They must guard their posts, be loyal to their duties, maintain normal work and social order, unite the 3.4 million people of all ethnic groups in the city, strive to complete various tasks, maintain a stable and united political situation, support you in executing martial law, quickly suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, restore normal order in the capital, and ensure that the cause of China's modernization continues to advance along the socialist road.

	Representatives of Advanced Party Branches and Outstanding Communist Party Members in Kunming

    你们立了大功人民感谢你们
    本报北京６月８日讯  戒严部队指挥部收到昆明市先进党支部、优秀共产党员代表致戒严部队的慰问电，全文如下：亲爱的执行戒严任务的全体解放军官兵、公安干警和武装警察同志们：
    你们辛苦了！首先让我们代表昆明市的全体共产党员向你们在平息首都发生的骇人听闻的反革命暴乱、恢复首都的正常秩序中所取得的重大胜利表示热烈祝贺！向你们为保卫社会主义制度、保卫人民政权、保卫祖国和人民的利益所创立的不朽功勋表示衷心的感谢！
    从６月３日凌晨开始，一小撮丧心病狂的暴徒在我们伟大祖国的首都北京，制造了一场严重的反革命暴乱，他们非法设置路障、抢劫武器、砸烧军车，肆意围攻、殴打、绑架和杀害解放军战士。他们进行反革命暴乱的目的，就是要反对党的领导，否定社会主义制度，颠覆中华人民共和国。对这一小撮暴徒的反革命暴行，我们表示极大的愤慨和仇恨。在这种严峻的形势面前，党中央、国务院、中央军委果断决策，戒严部队采取了坚决措施，一举粉碎了这场反革命暴乱。对中央的这一英明决策，我们表示坚决的支持。
    几天来，同志们在平息反革命暴乱的过程中，坚决执行神圣的戒严任务，开进途中，在遭到暴徒们疯狂辱骂、惨无人道的殴打、非法绑架的情况下，你们肩负党和人民的重托，发扬邓主席倡导的五种革命精神，英勇无畏，顽强奋战，狠狠打击了制造暴乱的一伙歹徒的反革命气焰。你们用自己的忠诚和热血证明，你们不愧为党领导下的英勇的人民子弟兵，不愧为国家和人民坚强的忠诚卫士，不愧为人民民主专政的坚强柱石。我们相信，在党中央、国务院和中央军委的正确领导下，你们一定能够紧紧依靠北京市广大人民群众和青年学生，继续发扬不怕艰难困苦、不怕流血牺牲的革命英雄主义精神，坚决彻底地平息这场反革命暴乱，谱写新的英雄篇章。
    地处祖国西南边疆春城的１３万共产党员，在这场关系党和国家前途命运的斗争面前，一定要做到坚决捍卫党中央的领导、坚决捍卫社会主义制度和人民民主专政，并在各自的工作岗位上充分发挥先锋模范作用，坚守工作岗位，忠于职守，维护正常的工作和社会秩序，团结全市３４０万各族人民，努力完成各项工作任务，维护安定团结的政治局面，用工作、生产、建设新成绩支援你们执行戒严任务，迅速平息反革命暴乱，恢复首都的正常秩序，使我国现代化建设事业沿着社会主义的道路不断前进。
