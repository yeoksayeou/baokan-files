Lanxi Establishes Agricultural Development Fund System

Lanxi City in Zhejiang Province has relied on rural self-accumulation to collect agricultural development funds at the city, township (town), and village levels. This has improved the policy of supplementing and supporting agriculture, thereby increasing effective investment in agriculture.

This effective measure to promote agricultural development in Lanxi City began in 1987. By now, all 50 townships in the city have established the agricultural development fund system, and 60 percent of the administrative villages have also established this system. According to statistics, by the end of last year, the city had collected a total of 4.778 million yuan in agricultural development funds over two years, with 75 percent of this amount coming from the township and village levels. Of this total, 22.538 million yuan was used for agricultural infrastructure construction.
