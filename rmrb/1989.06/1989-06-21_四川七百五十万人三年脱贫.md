In the process of deepening reforms, Sichuan Province has accelerated its poverty alleviation efforts. Over the past three years, 71 percent of impoverished households, totaling 7.5 million people, have resolved their food and clothing needs.

Three years ago, Sichuan Province had 46 impoverished counties with over 10 million agricultural population whose per capita annual income was less than 200 yuan, and whose grain supply was less than 300 kilograms per person. The production and living conditions were extremely difficult. The Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial Government have prioritized poverty alleviation work, and at all levels, leading groups headed by the main leaders of the Party and government have been established. Effective measures have been taken to achieve remarkable results in poverty alleviation work.
