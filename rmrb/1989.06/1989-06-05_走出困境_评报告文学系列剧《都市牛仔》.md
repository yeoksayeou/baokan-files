Title: Getting Out of the Dilemma - A Review of the Reportage Drama Series "Urban Cowboy"

For most audiences, the various bizarre and peculiar aspects of human relationships depicted in "Urban Cowboy" (written by Ling Shen and Liu Gang, performed by the Central Experimental Theater) undoubtedly belong to a different layer of life that they are not familiar with. However, even so, it is unlikely that anyone would find it unrealistic. This is certainly due to the work's ability to summarize life. The strange marriage between the naturally beautiful Fangfang and the crippled individual entrepreneur Wanlong, the humiliation and eventual descent into crime experienced by Zhao Jinming and Lin Ying, the fate of the rural girl Late Sister who came to the city to work and her complacent acceptance, the mysterious humiliation suffered by Quanzi, the owner of the Black Cat Restaurant, and her lover Wang Lei, as well as the dark underground gambling dens, the mysterious masked figures, and the open but twisted triangular relationships... Behind these various scenes, which are somewhat legendary, there is always a familiar ghost: money. It is money, like an invisible yet omnipresent thread, that manipulates and, to a certain extent, creates all of this.

Thus, the work possesses a power that brings it close to life and close to the audience. Indeed, individuals like Wanlong, Quanzi, and Niudagun, who bravely (and also urgently and greedily) play the role of urban "cowboys," are not the majority. In reality, it is rare to find someone who, for the sake of wealth, allows others to pry into the most private aspects of marital life. However, in the surroundings of every audience member, how many dramas of life caused by money have they not seen? Similarly, because of money, how many troubles and worries do people not encounter every day? More importantly, due to the rampant force of money in social life and its shameless mockery of traditional values, the psychological turmoil it causes in people—the various states of mind, desires, impulses, excitements, pains, and confusions—is not a common phenomenon? It also makes the choices of life that people are familiar with undergo various dazzling changes. The life stories presented in the work seem to belong more to that new "cowboy" group (this obviously makes the audience feel novel), but the social atmosphere of the times reflected in the work, and the central conflict that runs through the work, are things that everyone cannot avoid. Therefore, watching them, every audience member will surely feel a conscious or unconscious soul-searching (this also makes the audience feel somewhat heavy).

This soul-searching makes this seemingly lively and superficial work begin to have a philosophical meaning, although this meaning is hidden in the depths of the plot. The "urban cowboys" compete in the newly emerged social arena, relying on their wit, luck, hard work, and to some extent, unscrupulous methods. They have made money and become rich, finally becoming wealthy people that they could not even dream of in several generations. However, along with the piles of money, they have not gained the life they equally yearn for. Wanlong's marriage, built on money, results in an embarrassing wedding night (not to mention Wen Xiaoti's later involvement); Lin Ying makes a shocking "sacrifice," resulting in her own madness and her husband's imprisonment; Late Sister counts the money, but at the cost of a girl's chastity, and when the wealthy man Da Guo "righteously" defends himself, what he reveals is nothing but a petty soul... They seem to have fallen into a vicious circle: in the past, they lived poorly because they had no money, and now, because of money and having money, they still live poorly. They are always stuck in a life dilemma from which they cannot escape. Now, although they have money, they are even more painful and more confused.

In real life, poverty and wealth are indeed a stark contrast, but what mainly determines the value of life is not whether one has money or not. This does not mean that poverty can bring people a beautiful and valuable life. No, on the contrary, people today choose money and hope to live a wealthy life, which is indeed a great progress in history and society. We only say that if people cannot make their lives transcend the opposition of poverty and wealth, that is, transcend the money that determines poverty and wealth, then perhaps people will be destined to never escape the dilemma. This transcendence is built upon and determined by the search and exploration of the true value of life. The tragedy of Wanlong and other "urban cowboys" lies here, whether they were once poor or are now rich. In this sense, in the tide of the commodity economy, the final "beast in distress that is twisted, excited, dim, and yet shining" (as seen in the plot introduction of "Urban Cowboy") is not money, but the general lack of people's search for the meaning and value of life.

Therefore, the soul-searching of this work, for most audiences, has become an important and necessary thing. The Chinese people have always lacked the tradition of self-examination of the soul. The judgment of life and its value and meaning also often stays at the level of following the trend and seeking worldly satisfaction. From the once nationwide political fervor to the current rampant money worship, what is drawn is just a track that is fundamentally not much different. How do we get out of the life dilemma? In a word, what is the purpose of living? It is indeed time for everyone to question themselves and thereby establish their ultimate standards. In this sense, "Urban Cowboy" has sounded an alarm for us—although the bell rope needs us to grasp and pull it ourselves. For this reason, I think we all have reason to thank the entire creative team of this work.

　　走出困境
    ——评报告文学系列剧《都市牛仔》
    何志云
    对大多数观众来说，《都市牛仔》（凌申、柳岗编剧，中央实验话剧院演出）表现的这种种光怪陆离的人情世相，显然属于他们所不熟悉的另一生活层面。不过即便如此，想来也并不会有谁因此而觉得虚妄。这当然得力于作品对于生活的概括力。天生丽质的芳芳与瘸脚的个体大亨万龙的奇异婚配，赵金铭与林颖所遭历的难堪屈辱以及后来的堕入犯罪，进城打工的农村姑娘晚妹子的遭际与她的麻木自得，黑猫餐厅主人泉子与恋人汪蕾莫明其妙地遭受侮辱，还有阴暗的地下赌窟、扑朔迷离的蒙面人、公开却畸形的三角关系……在这一幅幅多少带着传奇色彩的当代都市风景的背后，始终游荡着一个人人熟悉的幽灵：金钱。正是金钱，犹如一根隐形而又无处不在的线，操纵着并在一定意义上制造出了这一切。
    作品于是就具有了一种迫近人生、迫近观众的力量。不错，万龙、泉子、牛大群一类勇敢（也带着急迫和贪婪）地充当了都市“牛仔”角色的个体户尚不在多数，为了发财，不惜让别人窥视夫妻间最为隐秘的房事，在现实生活中更属罕见。但是，在每一个观众的周遭，因为钱而引发的各种人生活剧，人们见到的难道还少么。同样因为钱，人们所遭历的困扰与烦恼，不也比比皆是么？更加重要的是，由于金钱在社会生活中的横冲直撞的力量，由于它对传统价值观念的肆无忌惮的嘲弄，围绕着它而引起的人的心理波折——那种种心态，那欲望、冲动、兴奋、痛苦和困惑——不更是一种司空见怪的现象，并且也使人们习熟的人生选择，发生了种种眼花缭乱的变化么？作品所表现的生活故事，看来较多地属于那个新兴的“牛仔”群落（这显然让观众感到新奇），但是，作品展示的社会时代氛围，贯串作品始终的矛盾焦点，却是每一个人都无法回避的。于是，看着他们，相信每一个观众都会感受到一种自觉不自觉的灵魂拷问（这又使观众或多或少地感到沉重）。
    这种灵魂拷问，使这部貌似热闹浅显的作品，开始具有一种哲理意味，尽管这种意味隐伏在剧情的深层。“都市牛仔”们在新近出现的社会竞技场上角逐，靠机敏也靠运气还靠吃苦受累和多多少少的不择手段，他们发了财致了富，终于成了几辈子梦寐不敢奢求的富人。但是，伴随着大把大把的金钱，他们并不曾获得他们同样梦寐以求的人生。万龙依仗金钱铺垫起来的婚姻，换来的是难堪的洞房之夜（且不说文小提后来的介入了）；林颖作出了骇人听闻的“牺牲”，结果是自己的发疯和丈夫锒铛入狱；晚妹子数着那一叠钱，却是以少女的贞节作为代价的，而卖大户的大郭“义正辞严”地为自己辩护的时候，他自我抖露出来的不过是一颗卑琐的心灵……他们仿佛都不由自主地陷入了一个怪圈：过去，他们因为没钱而生活得不好，如今则因为了钱和有了钱而照旧生活得不好。他们总是陷在一种人生困境里拔不出脚来。现在尽管有了钱，他们反倒更加痛苦，更加回顾茫然。
    在现实生活中，穷和富固然是一种截然的对立，但是，决定人生价值的主要并不在是否有钱。这并不是说，穷困能给人们带来美好而有价值的人生。不，不是的，相反，人们在今天选择钱，期望过一种富裕的生活，实在是历史与社会的巨大进步。我们只是说，倘若人们不能使自己的人生超越于穷富的对立，也就是说超越于决定穷和富的金钱，那么，也许人们就将被注定了永远无法走出困境。这种超越建筑于并且决定于对于真正的人生价值的寻找和探求。万龙等“都市牛仔”们的悲剧的实质就在这里，无论他们是曾经穷困也罢，还是而今富有也罢。在这个意义上，在商品经济大潮里，最终“使人扭曲、亢奋、暗淡又闪光的那头困兽”（见《都市牛仔》的剧情介绍）并不就是金钱，而是人们对于人生意义和价值的探求的普遍缺乏。
    因此，作品的这种灵魂拷问，对大多数观众来说，又切切实实地成了一种重要和必须。中国人历来缺乏对灵魂的自我拷问的传统。对于人生及其价值和意义的评判，也常常停留于随波逐流，趋时附尚的世俗满足里。从曾经有过的举国一致的政治狂热，到如今甚嚣尘上的金钱迷恋，所划出来的，不过是一条在根本上没多大区别的轨迹。我们怎么走出人生困境？换用一句老百姓的话来说，人活着，究竟为了什么？确实到了每一个人逼问自己，并由此确立始极标准的时候了。在这个意义上，《都市牛仔》给我们敲响了警钟——尽管这根钟绳需要我们自己去把握并且拉动它。为了这一点，我想，我们都有理由感谢这部作品的全体创作人员。
