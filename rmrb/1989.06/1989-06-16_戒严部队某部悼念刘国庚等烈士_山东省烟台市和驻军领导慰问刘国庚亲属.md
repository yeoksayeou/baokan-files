This morning, several hundred officers and soldiers from the command headquarters of a certain unit of the martial law troops came to the site where Liu Guogeng, the martyr, was killed on Xidan Road, West Chang'an Street, to hold a memorial ceremony.

	Nearly one hundred wreaths and flower baskets surrounded a display board that recorded the martyr's brief life and the circumstances of his death. Liu Guogeng was a second lieutenant and platoon leader in a certain unit of the martial law troops. He was 25 years old and a member of the Communist Youth League from Laiyang City, Shandong Province. He enlisted in 1983 and graduated from Chongqing Communication Institute. On the early morning of June 4, Liu Guogeng, along with his vehicle, entered the assembly area of his unit and learned that some of his unit's vehicles loaded with radios, weapons, and ammunition were besieged near the Six Departments area. He volunteered to go and rescue them. When he rushed to the besieged military vehicles, he was severely injured by thugs using bricks and iron rods. They poured gasoline on him and set him on fire. Despite his injuries, he lunged towards the thugs, only to be knocked down again. He perished in the flames.

	After the memorial ceremony for Liu Guogeng, the martial law troops proceeded to Cuiming Road to hold a memorial ceremony for the six soldiers who heroically sacrificed their lives there.

	Yesterday afternoon, leaders from the Shandong Provincial Government, Yantai Municipal Party and Government, and the stationed military units visited and comforted the family of Liu Guogeng, the martyr who sacrificed his life while performing martial law duties in Beijing.

	Liu Guogeng's father, Liu Zhirong, is a second-grade disabled veteran from the War of Liberation. His mother has been bedridden for a decade due to rheumatoid arthritis and heart disease. Around 3:30 AM on June 4, Liu Guogeng was beaten to death by rioters with bricks and iron rods while performing duties with the martial law troops. His charred body was hung on a burned-out large car with a rope. The rioters also inserted a stick in his hand and placed a military cap on his head, defaming the image of the military.

	Chen Jianguang, Secretary of the Yantai Municipal Party Committee, on behalf of the 6 million people of the city, expressed his highest respect and warmest condolences to the martyr's family and expressed deep sorrow for the martyr's death.

	The martyr's father, with tears in his eyes, said to the leaders who came to comfort him, "My son sacrificed his life to defend the motherland and maintain the security of the capital. His death is worth it. I am grateful from the bottom of my heart for the concern of the leaders at all levels."
