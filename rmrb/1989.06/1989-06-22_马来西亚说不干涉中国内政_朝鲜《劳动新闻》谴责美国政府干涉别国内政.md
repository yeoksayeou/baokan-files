Xinhua News Agency, Singapore, June 22nd.

According to a report by Malaysia's *Sin Chew Daily* today, Malaysia's Deputy Foreign Minister Abdullah Fadzil on June 21st reiterated that Malaysia has consistently adhered to the principle of non-interference in the internal affairs of other countries regarding the recent turmoil in China.

Abdullah Fadzil made this statement in response to a question from a member of the Malaysian Parliament. He said that the Malaysian government believes that the turmoil in China is an internal matter and that Malaysia should not interfere in China's internal affairs.

He said that Malaysia continues to adhere to the one-China policy, recognizing the People's Republic of China as the sole legal government and Taiwan as part of China's territory.

He said that Malaysia's relations with China remain unchanged. As the situation in China has gradually returned to normal, the Malaysian government does not prevent its citizens from visiting China.

People's Daily, Pyongyang, June 22nd.

Reporter Xu Baokang reports: Today, North Korea's *Rodong Sinmun* published an article denouncing the U.S. government's interference in the internal affairs of North Korea and other countries, calling it an attempt to impose their will on others.

The article states that the U.S. has consistently used political, diplomatic, military, and economic pressure to interfere in the internal affairs of other countries, attempting to intimidate and threaten them with a "policy of strength."

The article points out that the U.S.'s purpose in interfering in the internal affairs of other countries is to turn these countries into political, economic, and military satellites. The U.S.'s continued occupation of South Korea, disregarding the will of the Korean people and attempting to permanently divide Korea, is a prime example.

The article concludes by stating that the U.S. must stop interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. Anyone who brazenly interferes in the internal affairs of others is doomed to fail.

　　马来西亚说不干涉中国内政    
    朝鲜《劳动新闻》谴责美国政府干涉别国内政
    新华社新加坡６月２２日电  据马来西亚《星洲日报》今天报道，马来西亚外交部副部长阿卜杜拉·法齐勒２１日重申，马来西亚对中国最近发生的动乱事件始终遵守不干涉他国内政的原则。
    阿卜杜拉·法齐勒是在马来西亚国会回答议员询问时重申马来西亚这一立场的。他说，马来西亚政府认为，中国动乱事件是中国内部事务，马来西亚不应插手干涉中国的内政。
    他说，马来西亚仍然坚持一个中国的立场，即中华人民共和国政府，台湾为中国领土的一部分。
    他说，马来西亚对中国关系不变。由于中国局势已逐渐恢复平静，马来西亚政府并不阻止它的国民访问中国。
    本报平壤６月２２日电　记者徐宝康报道：朝鲜《劳动新闻》今天发表署名文章，严正谴责美国政府干涉朝鲜和其他国家内政，是企图把他们的意志强加于人。
    文章说，从政治、外交、军事、经济上施加压力来干涉别国内政，是美国的一贯做法，他们妄图以“实力政策”对别国进行威胁和恐吓。
    文章指出，美国干涉别国内政的目的，是企图把这些国家变成自己在政治、经济、军事上的附庸。美国不顾朝鲜人民的意愿，继续霸占南朝鲜，企图永久分裂朝鲜，就是一个例证。
    文章最后指出，美国必须停止干涉别国内政，任何粗暴干涉别国内政的人，都注定要失败。
