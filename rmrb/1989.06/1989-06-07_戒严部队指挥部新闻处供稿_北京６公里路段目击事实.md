Eyewitness Accounts from a 6-Kilometer Stretch in Beijing

According to a report from the *Liberation Army Daily*, the streets of Beijing bear the marks of the violent acts committed by counter-revolutionary thugs. Below are the facts observed by a reporter along a 6-kilometer stretch.

At the intersection of Jinsong Road West, there is a burned-out military truck, with two damaged public buses on either side. Moving east along Jinsong Road, on the left side of the road, there are 24 military trucks, all of which have been burned out. The driver's cabs are tilted in various directions, the bodies are unrecognizable, and the metal parts have all turned red.

On Yongdingmen Outer Street, there are garbage bins strewn about, used as roadblocks. Stones and bricks used to attack the martial law troops are scattered everywhere. Along this street, there are also 8 burned-out military trucks and one overturned and burned Beijing Jeep.

On Tian Tan East Road and Ti Yu Guan Road, there are several burned-out military trucks. Near the north gate of Tian Tan Park, there are 3 trees used as roadblocks by the thugs, along with many scattered stones and bricks. At the north gate of Tian Tan Park, there is a burned-out armored vehicle with most of its parts stripped out. Additionally, there are two damaged local vehicles. Along the 6-kilometer stretch the reporter traversed, 43 military vehicles were burned out.

In Tian Tan Park, the reporter saw a soldier's body, a gruesome sight. This soldier was burned to death by thugs on the afternoon of June 4th and then hung from the overpass at Chongwenmen with a rope. A deputy chief of staff from a certain regiment discovered the body and led soldiers to retrieve it under a hail of stones thrown by the thugs. The charred body had ropes around the neck and ankles.

    北京６公里路段目击事实
    本报讯  据《解放军报》报道：在北京街头的许多地方，记录着反革命歹徒所施暴行的痕迹。下面是记者在６公里左右的路段上目击的事实。
    在劲松路西口立交桥头，有一辆被烧毁的军用卡车，两边还有两辆被毁坏的公共汽车。沿劲松路向东，路左侧一排２４辆军用卡车全部被烧毁，驾驶室东倒西歪，车体面目皆非，铁质部分都已变红色。
    在永定门外大街上，横七竖八躺着用做路障的垃圾箱，用来袭击戒严部队官兵的石块、碎砖块到处可见。在这条大街上，还有８辆被烧毁的军用卡车，另有一辆被翻倒又焚毁的北京吉普。
    在天坛东路和体育馆路也有数辆被焚毁的军用卡车，在接近天坛公园北门的一段马路上，躺着暴徒们用做路障的３棵树，并有许多碎石和碎砖块。在天坛公园北门有一辆被烧毁的装甲车，里面的零件几乎被拆光。另外还有被毁坏的两辆地方小车。记者所经过的６公里路上有４３辆军用车被焚毁。
    在天坛公园，记者见到一具战士尸体，令人惨不忍睹。这个战士是在６月４日下午被暴徒们烧焦后，又用绳索吊在崇文门过街天桥上的。某团副参谋长发现后，带领战士冒着暴徒们投掷的雨点般的碎石，抢下这具焦尸。焦尸的脖颈上和脚脖上缠绕着绳索。
