When men and women compete for the most precious things in life—longevity and health—women always come out on top. They live an average of six years longer and are less likely to suffer from heart disease and strokes in middle age. This is not just a matter of luck; it is because women smoke and drink less than men and are more likely to seek medical help.

However, men are catching up. Men aged 45-55 are in better physical condition than other age groups. The main disadvantage for men—the number of heart disease and lung cancer patients—has significantly decreased.

The reason for these changes lies in the shift in people's lifestyles. Nowadays, liberated British women smoke and drink more. In 1971, the number of men admitted to mental hospitals for alcohol-related problems was four times that of women, but 12 years later, this ratio had dropped to two. Especially among young women, delaying marriage and working outside the home has led to increased drinking (the number of single women with moderate to severe alcohol problems is about twice that of married women). Unfortunately, alcohol is more harmful to women than to men. Women are more likely to develop cirrhosis of the liver, and once damaged, their livers are harder to recover than men's. Between 1979 and 1987, the number of women dying from cirrhosis increased by 37%, while for men, it only increased by 11%.

Men are quitting smoking faster than women. According to statistics, in the 10 years up to 1986, the proportion of adult male smokers decreased by 24%, while for women, it only decreased by 18%.

Additionally, men pay more attention to physical exercise. One-fifth of men have increased their ability to prevent heart disease through exercise. Women, however, do not engage in as much physical activity, with only 1 in 50 women participating in exercise.

Meanwhile, the incidence of some diseases that plague women is on the rise. Between 1963 and 1983, the death rate from breast cancer increased by a quarter. According to current trends, by the end of the century, 4,000 women will die from cervical cancer each year.

The gap in estimated lifespans between the sexes is narrowing. Between 1973 and 1984, the estimated lifespan at birth for men increased by 2.3 years, and for women, it increased by 1.8 years. This gap is expected to narrow further.

    寿命的性别差距正在缩小
    当男人与女人竞争以获得生命中最宝贵的两样东西——长寿和健康时，女人总是胜过男人。她们平均要多活六年之久，而且在中年患心脏病和中风的较少。这并不是因为她们运气好而是因为她们抽烟、喝酒比男人少，而且更经常地去求医看病。
    不过，现在男人也赶上来了。45—55岁的男人比其他年龄段的身体要好。男人比女人不利的主要原因即身患心脏病和肺癌的人数已大大下降。
    上述变化的原因是人的生活习惯的改变，现在，英国新解放的妇女抽烟和喝酒更凶了。1971年因酒精有关的问题，收入精神病医院的男性为女性的四倍，而12年后仅为两倍。特别是年轻姑娘由于推迟婚姻和出外工作而学会喝酒（单身妇女中程度中等或严重的酒徒数约为已婚妇女的两倍）。不幸的是，酒精对妇女的伤害要比对男人重得多。女性更容易患肝硬化，她们的肝脏一旦受损，比男人更难康复。1979—1987年之间，女性死于肝硬化的人数增加了37％，而男性只增加了11％。
    男性戒烟比女性要快。据有关部门统计，截至1986年的10年中，成年男性吸烟者的比例下降24％，而女性只下降了18％。
    另外，男人比女人更注意锻炼身体。有1／5的男性由于锻炼身体，在一定程度上增添了预防心脏病的能力。而女人不常开展体育活动，只有1／50的女性从事锻炼。
    与此同时，一些折磨女性的疾病的发生率正在上升。1963—1983年间，乳房癌的死亡率增加了1／4。据发展趋势，到本世纪末每年将有4000女性死于子宫颈癌。
    性别间估计寿命的差距正在缩小。1973—1984年间，出生时的估计寿命男性增加2.3岁，女性增加1.8岁。这一差距还将进一步缩小。
