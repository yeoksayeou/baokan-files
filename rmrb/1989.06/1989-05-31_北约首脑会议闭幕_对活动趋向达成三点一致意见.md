	NATO Summit Concludes
	Agreement Reached on Three Key Points

	BRUSSELS, May 30 (Xinhua) — The NATO summit concluded at noon on May 30. Before the meeting ended, the alliance issued "A Comprehensive Concept on Arms Control and Disarmament" and a political declaration. NATO Secretary-General Manfred Wörner, speaking at a press conference after the meeting, said the summit had achieved "significant success."

	Since U.S. President George H.W. Bush publicly announced the U.S. government's proposals for East-West arms talks yesterday, the pessimistic atmosphere hanging over the meeting has dissipated. On the nights of May 29 and 30, the foreign ministers of the 16 member countries engaged in "intense debate" and finally reached a compromise.

	The heads of state or government of the 16 countries attending the meeting outlined NATO's future activities in the "declaration" and "comprehensive concept" documents: 1. Strengthen cooperation with the Soviet Union in the political, economic, technological, and social fields in Eastern Europe, "to establish a new political order of peace in Europe." 2. While maintaining the principle of deterrence, express a willingness to reduce existing military forces to the "minimum level." 3. While insisting that both conventional and nuclear forces are "indivisible parts of the deterrence strategy," agree to negotiate with the Soviet Union on short-range nuclear weapons, but neither document mentions the "third zero option."

　　北约首脑会议闭幕
    对活动趋向达成三点一致意见
    本报布鲁塞尔电  记者魏崴报道：北约首脑会议于５月３０日中午闭幕。会议结束前发表了《关于控制军备和裁军的总体构想》和一项政治宣言。北约秘书长韦尔纳在会议结束后举行的记者招待会上认为，此次首脑会议取得了“重大成功”。
    自从美国总统布什昨日公开发表了美国政府关于东西方裁军会谈的建议之后，笼罩在会议上空的悲观气氛为之一扫。２９—３０日夜间，参加会议的１６个成员国外长经过了“激烈的争论”，终于达成妥协。
    出席会议的１６国国家或政府首脑在“宣言”和“总体构想”两文件中，阐述了北约今后的活动趋向：１、加强和苏联在东欧国家的政治、经济、科技、社会等领域内的合作，“在欧洲建立一个和平的政治新秩序”。２、在坚持威慑原则的同时，表示愿意把现有的军事力量削减到“最小限度”。３、在坚持常规力量与核力量均是“威慑战略的不可分割的一部分”的同时，同意在短程核武器问题上，和苏联进行会谈，但对于“第三个零点方案”，两个文件都没有涉及。
