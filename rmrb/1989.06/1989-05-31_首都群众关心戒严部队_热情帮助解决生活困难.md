In recent days, reporters in the capital have frequently seen trucks, horse-drawn carriages, and tricycles loaded with fresh vegetables, daily necessities, and various foodstuffs heading towards the camps... The people have gradually transformed their past doubts into understanding and genuine affection, which is now turning into concrete actions to support the troops.

Warmly assisting the martial law troops in solving living difficulties and ensuring that the troops have good food and shelter has become a common wish among some residents of the capital. It is understood that in recent days, the commercial and grain supply system workers in Fengtai District have supplied the martial law troops with ten thousand kilograms of rice and flour, more than ten thousand kilograms of cooking oil, pastries, meat, eggs, and vegetables. In addition to supplying grain, oil, vegetables, and meat to the martial law troops, the Haidian District Government also provided a large number of cotton mats to keep the soldiers warm and dry. The Shijingshan District Committee mobilized six streets, villages, and a hotel to vacate two thousand beds for the troops to rest. The Fengtai District Coal Company, upon learning that the troops urgently needed firewood for cooking, immediately supplied three thousand kilograms of chopped wood to the troops. At a certain martial law troop's "open-air convenience store," fruit juices, canned goods, cigarettes, fruits, beer, and eggs are neatly arranged for the officers and soldiers to purchase. The eight employees from the Fengtai District Sanqianmen Food Market serving here told reporters: "A few days ago, we refused to sell anything to the soldiers. Now we understand that the soldiers are not here to suppress the students; they are here to maintain order and protect the interests of the people. We sisters have voluntarily organized a 'Support the Soldiers Service Team' and work early and late every day to serve the officers and soldiers of the martial law troops."

It is understood that at present, with the strong support of the people, the martial law troops have all set up camps at the designated locations. They not only have good food and shelter but can also watch television. Many officers and soldiers of the martial law troops have also held military-civilian joint celebrations with local residents and performing arts troupes that came to visit, performing artistic programs together on stage.

　　首都群众关心戒严部队
    热情帮助解决生活困难
    新华社北京五月三十一日电  连日来，记者在首都戒严部队不时见到一辆辆满载新鲜蔬菜、日用百货和各种副食品的汽车、马车、三轮车驶向营区……人民群众一改往日的疑虑，理解和真情正渐渐转化为热爱子弟兵的实际行动。
    热情帮助戒严部队解决生活困难，保证部队吃好、住好，已成为首都一些群众的共同心愿。据了解，连日来，丰台区商业、粮食系统的职工，为戒严部队供应十万公斤大米、白面，上万公斤食油、糕点、肉、蛋和蔬菜。海淀区人民政府除了给戒严部队送去粮、油、菜、肉等食品外，还供应了大量棉垫让战士们防潮御寒。石景山区委还动员了六个街道、村庄和一个宾馆，腾出两千张床位，供部队休息。丰台区煤炭公司得知部队生火做饭急需柴禾，他们当天就把筹集的三千公斤劈柴供应部队。在某戒严部队的“露天小卖部”，整齐摆着果汁饮料、罐头、香烟、水果、啤酒、鸡蛋等，供部队指战员选购。在这里服务的丰台区三营门副食品商场的八名职工告诉记者：前几天，我们见到解放军一律不卖给他们东西，现在我们明白了解放军确实不是来镇压学生的，是来维持秩序的、保护人民群众利益的。我们姐妹们自觉组织起“支援解放军服务队”，天天早出晚归为戒严部队官兵服务。
    据了解，目前，戒严部队在人民群众的大力支援下，已全部在预定地点安营生活，他们不仅能吃好、住好，还能看上电视，不少戒严部队官兵还与地方群众和前来慰问的文艺团体，开展军民联欢，同台演唱文艺节目。
