In the eyes of some people, the household registration office of the public security bureau is a place with a lot of "grease," and the head of the household registration office, who holds the power to approve the transfer of rural to urban and agricultural to non-agricultural household registrations, is an "oily position." However, Li Chen, the head of the household registration office of the West Ganting District Public Security Bureau in Dalian City, Liaoning Province, does not think so. He says, "Our power is given by the Party and the people, and we must not use our power for personal gain."

	Power Test

Li Chen has been the head of the household registration office for 9 years, and his family of four still lives in a dark, unheated two-room "tube house." Someone asked in confusion, "You manage the household registrations of tens of thousands of people. Changing to a better house is just a matter of saying a word, right?" Li Chen smiled, "We don't do things that make people talk behind our backs."

One morning in the summer of 1987, three staff members from a construction command center in Dalian came to Li Chen's office: "Old Li, we want to help you improve your living conditions. You just need to do us a small favor." It turned out that a family member of a staff member from the construction command center had a rural household registration and wanted to move to the city. Li Chen carefully inquired about the situation and found that it did not meet the requirements for moving to the city. He clearly said, "Everyone wants to live in a good house, but if the house is not obtained through proper channels, I won't feel comfortable living in it either. The things you ask me to do, I can't do." One of the staff members quickly changed the subject: "Old Li, you just need to make a phone call to the Xiangluojiao Police Station to establish a household registration, and we'll help you change your house." Li Chen flatly refused: "I am the head of the household registration office. If I don't handle things according to regulations, how can I have the face to educate others in the future?"

"Use power for the public good," this is Li Chen's motto. He never abuses power that goes against policies; he strives to help residents solve their problems.

In the Dayin Street of West Ganting District, there is an old worker who has suffered from severe rheumatoid arthritis due to long-term work at sea and can only walk with the help of crutches, needing someone by his side to take care of him. Li Chen learned during his visits that the old worker's wife still had a rural household registration. He immediately had the on-duty police officers from the police station conduct a household registration investigation. Soon, the police station reported the household registration application procedures and investigation results to the household registration office. After re-examination, Li Chen quickly responded. The old worker, holding his wife's household registration transfer certificate, said excitedly, "If government officials all cared for the people like Director Li, that would be great!"

	Money Test

Over the years, many people have given Li Chen money and various gifts to handle household registration matters, but he has always adhered to the principle of "not touching unrighteous wealth" and maintained a clean and upright style.

In early spring in March, a resident came to Li Chen's home, talking about his wife who was ill in the countryside and expressing the wish to move to the city. After sending the guest off, Li Chen found a box of unopened Shilin brand cigarettes on the table. Upon opening it, he found twenty 50-yuan notes. The next morning, Li Chen and a police officer went to the resident's home and handed him 1,000 yuan in cash, saying seriously, "The public security bureau has never used the amount of money as a condition for approving or not approving household registrations."

After investigation, the resident's wife met the conditions for moving to the city and was quickly approved. A few days later, the resident came to Li Chen's home again, handing over the 1,000 yuan, saying, "Old Li, when the household registration was not approved, you didn't take this money; now you take it, and if something happens, it's my responsibility."

Li Chen sincerely said, "I just did what I should have done according to national policies. I appreciate your kindness, but I cannot accept the money."

	Relationship Test

Li Chen holds the power to approve household registrations. Over the years, more than 100 relatives, friends, and colleagues have come to him to plead for their friends and relatives. However, out of the 1,900-plus various urban household registration applications he has approved, not a single one has violated the policies.

Before the Spring Festival, two old cadres who had known Li Chen for more than 20 years came to his door, requesting him to approve a rural-to-urban household registration. Li Chen clearly pointed out that the person applying for the household registration did not meet the conditions for moving to the city. However, the other party got angry upon hearing this, "Old Li, don't give us official talk. If they met the conditions, they wouldn't have come to you." Li Chen replied bluntly, "If they don't meet the conditions, even if they are my own parents, I won't approve it."

Li Chen's adherence to principles has offended many people. Some say he is "stubborn," some complain that he is "not approachable," and some mock him for "holding a 'golden lump' but not knowing how to use it." However, the Party and the people have given him a fair evaluation. Residents say, "The more household registration office heads like Li Chen, the better." The West Ganting District Committee awarded him the honor of "Outstanding Communist Party Member," and the household registration office he leads has been rated as a civilized unit in Dalian City twice.

　　户籍科长过“三关”    
    ——大连市西岗区公安分局李忱的故事
    苗红亮　江云洲
    在一些人的眼里，公安局的户籍科是一个“油水”很大的地方，掌管“乡进城”、“农转非”户口审批权的户籍科长更是一个“肥缺”。辽宁省大连市西岗区公安分局户籍科长李忱却不这么认为，他说，“我们的权力是党和人民给的，决不能以权谋私。”
    　　　　权力关
    李忱当户籍科长９年了，一家四口至今仍住在阴暗、没有暖气的两小间“筒房”里。有人不解：“你掌管着几十万人的户口，换套好房还不是一句话的事？”李忱一笑：“让人背后戳脊梁骨的事，咱不干。”
    １９８７年夏季的一天上午，大连一工程指挥部的３位工作人员来到李忱的办公室：“老李，我们想帮你改善改善住房条件，你只要帮个小忙就行。”原来，工程指挥部一名工作人员的家属户口在农村，要求办理进城。李忱详细地询问了情况，认为不符合进城规定，他明确地说：“谁都愿意住上好房子，但不是正道来的房子，我住着也不舒坦。你们求我的事，我办不成。”一位工作人员忙转开了话题：“老李，你只要挂个电话给香炉礁派出所立一份户口，房子我们帮你换。”李忱一口回绝：“我是户籍科长，如果我自己不按规定办事，今后哪有脸教育别人？”
    “要用权为公”，这是李忱的座右铭。对违反政策的权力，他从不滥用；对居民的疾苦，他努力帮助解决。
    西岗区日新街道有一名老工人，因为常年在海上作业，患有严重的风湿性关节炎，依靠双拐才能走路，身边需要人照顾。李忱在走访中了解他爱人户口仍在农村，立即让派出所的外勤民警进行户口调查。不久，派出所将户口申报手续和调查结果报到了户籍科，经过复查，李忱很快作了批复。那位老工人拿着爱人的户口迁移证，激动地说：“要是政府干部都像李科长这样关心百姓，那该有多好！”
    　　　　金钱关
    多年来，一些人为了办理户口，送给李忱的金钱和各种各样的礼物应有尽有，但他坚持“不义之财不可沾”的原则，始终保持着清正廉洁的作风。
    初春３月，一居民找到李忱家，述说在农村患有疾病的爱人，提出进城的愿望。送客归来，李忱发现桌子上放有一盒没开封的石林牌香烟。打开一看，竟装着二十张面额５０元的人民币。第二天一早，李忱和一位民警一起找到那位居民，把１０００元现款交到他手中，并严肃地说：“公安局办户口从来不是以钱的多少来作为是否批准的条件。”
    经过调查，那位居民的爱人符合进城条件，并很快得到批准。事过几天，那位居民又来到李忱家，再次拿出了那１０００元钱说：“老李，当初户口没批，你不收这些钱；现在你收下，出了事儿算我的。”
    李忱诚恳地说，“我只是按国家政策做了应该做的事，你的心意我领了，钱决不能收。”
    　　　　人情关
    李忱掌握着审批户口的大权，几年来，一些亲属、朋友和同事，先后有１００多人为他们的亲朋好友来找李忱求情。然而，经他审批的１９００多份各类进城户口，没有一份违背政策的。
    春节前，有两位和李忱相处了２０多年的老干部找上门来，要求他给一份乡进城户口，李忱明确指出办户口的人不符合进城条件。谁知对方一听就火了，“老李，你不要跟我们打官腔，要是够条件就不来找你了。”李忱回答得很干脆：“不够条件，就是亲娘老子的也不批。”
    李忱坚持原则，得罪了不少人。有人说他“死心眼儿”，有人埋怨他“不开面儿”，也有人讥讽他“握着‘金疙瘩’不会使。”但是，党和人民却给予了他公正的评价，居民群众说：“李忱这样的户籍科长，越多越好。”西岗区委授予他“优秀共产党员”的光荣称号，他领导的户籍科，曾两次被评为大连市文明单位。
