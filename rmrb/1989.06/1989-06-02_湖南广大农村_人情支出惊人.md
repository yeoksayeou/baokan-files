	Rural areas across Hunan province are witnessing an alarming surge in expenditures related to social obligations.

	According to a survey conducted by the Hunan Provincial Agricultural Adjustment Team involving 3,700 households in 37 counties and cities, the average household expenditure on "social obligations" in the first quarter of this year amounted to 106.17 yuan in cash, an increase of 15.9 yuan compared to the same period last year, marking a 17.61% rise. If this trend continues, the total cash expenditure on "social obligations" for the 14.85 million households in the province would reach 15.77 billion yuan, which is equivalent to 48 times the total fixed asset investment completed in the province's agricultural sector for the first quarter.
