Bulgaria opposes foreign interference in China's internal affairs and supports China's measures to stabilize the domestic situation.

Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 13 (Reporter Liu Fuping) Bulgarian Foreign Minister Petar Mladenov said on the afternoon of the 13th when he met with Chinese Ambassador to Bulgaria Li Fenglin that Bulgaria supports China's measures to stabilize the domestic situation and opposes foreign interference in China's internal affairs.

The Bulgarian foreign minister said that the Bulgarian leadership and the public are concerned about the recent events in China. He pointed out that it is gratifying to see that the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing has been suppressed and social life is gradually returning to normal.

Mladenov expressed opposition to external forces interfering in China's internal affairs, as such interference can only hinder the normalization and stabilization of the situation in China. He believes that the measures taken by the Chinese leadership are aimed at consolidating social stability, restoring national order, and defending the socialist achievements of the Chinese working people.

The Bulgarian foreign minister finally expressed the hope that the current difficulties in China will soon pass, and the great Chinese people will continue to advance along the road of socialist reform.
