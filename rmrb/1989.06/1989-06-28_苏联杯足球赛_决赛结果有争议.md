Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, June 27th.

The first-time finalist Dnipro team won the 48th Soviet Cup football tournament by defeating the veteran powerhouse Torpedo team 1-0 in a controversial match.

The Soviet Cup football tournament concluded on June 25. However, Soviet football fans are still debating whether the cup should stay with Dnipro.

During the first half of the final, Torpedo had equalized the score with a goal just before the end of the half. However, the linesman Medvedev signaled for offside, and the referee nullified the goal.

However, the replay of the match did not clearly prove the offside. The referee of the match, national referee Tabakov, believed that the two officials made a serious mistake. Torpedo has lodged a protest, and the Soviet Football Federation's expert committee is currently investigating the matter.

　　苏联杯足球赛    
    决赛结果有争议
    新华社莫斯科六月二十七日电  首次闯入决赛的第聂伯队在有争议的比赛中以一比零战胜老牌劲旅托尔佩多队，捧走了第四十八届苏联杯足球赛的奖杯。
    今年苏联杯足球赛是二十五日结束的。然而，苏联球迷对苏联杯能否继续留在第聂伯队，仍然议论纷纷。
    原来，托尔佩多队曾在决赛上半时终场前回敬了对方一球，将比分扳平。但巡边员梅德韦茨基示意越位，主裁判遂判此球无效。
    但是，从赛后播放的录相中却难以证实这次越位。这场比赛的仲裁、国家级裁判塔巴科夫认为上述两位裁判严重失误。为此，托尔佩多队已提出抗议，苏联足协专家委员会正在对此进行研究。
