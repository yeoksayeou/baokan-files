Hubei Province has recently launched a comprehensive investigation into officials and employees building private houses in violation of laws and regulations.

Vice Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Committee, Zhao Fulin, stated that this investigation targets party and government officials, as well as employees of enterprises and public institutions who have built private houses in urban areas since January 1986. The focus is on investigating cases where leading officials and those in charge of personnel, finances, and materials have violated laws and regulations in building private houses. For private houses built by officials and employees before the end of 1985, if they were not previously investigated or if issues were not resolved, or if new violations are discovered, they will also be investigated.

It is understood that the main contents of this investigation include whether the conditions and approval procedures for building houses are complete and legal; whether there are issues of under-reporting and over-occupying land, unauthorized relocation, public land for private use, or evading or underpaying "three fees and one tax"; and whether the funding sources and construction costs are consistent.

　　湖北清查干部建私房问题
    据新华社武汉６月１日电  （记者方政军、实习生王汉清）湖北省清查干部违法违纪建私房工作近日全面展开。
    湖北省委副书记赵富林说，这次清查的范围是１９８６年元月以后，党政机关、企事业单位干部、职工在城镇建造的私房，重点是查处领导干部和掌握人财物实权的干部违法违纪建造私房的问题。对１９８５年底以前干部职工在城镇建造的私房，凡是过去没有清查或已清查而问题没有得到处理、或又发现违法违纪行为的，也要清查。
    据了解，这次清查的主要内容是建房条件和审批手续是否完备和合法；征用土地有无少征多占、擅自易地、公征私建、偷漏或少交“三费一税”；资金来源与建房造价是否相符等。
