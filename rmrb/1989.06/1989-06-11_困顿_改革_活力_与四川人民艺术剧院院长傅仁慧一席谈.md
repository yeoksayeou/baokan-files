Facing the challenges of a commodity economy and other forms of art, the theatre industry is in a state of stagnation. Sichuan People's Art Theatre (Sichuan People's Theatre) – the leading theatre in the southwestern region – has finally hit a low point. What is the way out for Sichuan People's Theatre? Where is the vitality of the theatre genre? Where will the funds for developing artistic production come from?... One question after another is troubling the leaders and every member of the troupe. Recently, it has been heard that they have made some encouraging progress in solving these difficulties, so I visited Fu Renhui, the director of Sichuan People's Art Theatre.

▲ What are the main problems facing your theatre?

● There are many problems, mainly in the following areas: First, the morale is low. Actors feel that rehearsing plays is a waste of effort, as they only perform a few times after rehearsing for half a day. It's better to act in TV shows, which have a wider reach and greater influence among the audience. Generally speaking, theatre lacks a kind of cohesion. Second, the cast and crew are seriously aging, and there is a shortage of middle-aged and young actors. Currently, the number of retired and soon-to-retire personnel is nearly one-third of the total number. They cannot participate in theatre production, and it is difficult to retain excellent middle-aged and young actors. Due to the relatively poor conditions of the theatre, some young female actors have become "public relations officers" in large companies. Additionally, since our province does not have a drama school, there is a lack of reserve talent. Good students from drama schools do not want to come to Sichuan, and the theatre does not have the conditions to provide especially favorable treatment, which is the most serious problem. Third, there is a shortage of funds. The current budget, after paying salaries, leaves very little, and the development of the business is facing a crisis. Fourth, the means of artistic production are single, and theatre performances are facing difficulties. Fifth, there are many idle members in the performance team, and their salaries and allowances are still managed by the theatre, making the theatre's burden very heavy.

▲ How do you plan to solve these problems? Will theatre disappear?

● Theatre is in a low point, which means it will not develop and will disappear. It will always seek new paths. Our "Deepening Reform Trial Plan" may be a turning point. Through this plan, we hope to find a way out, revitalize theatre art, and implement a transfer of artistic productivity, opening up a broad path for the development of the theatre industry.

▲ The economic issue is a major problem facing the theatre. How do you handle the relationship between economic benefits and social benefits?

● We have always valued social benefits and tried to prioritize them. In the future, we will grasp the main theme of reform, carefully select plays, and focus on producing plays that can have a social impact. We will strive for artistic exploration and innovation, better fulfilling the theatre's experimental and demonstrative role in the theatre industry. At the same time, we need to address the problem of insufficient openness in selecting plays. As long as they are not low-level and ugly, they can be performed, making the content more diverse. For example, recently, the theatre boldly staged a multi-episode play titled "Absurd World," adapted from a famous contemporary Japanese detective novel. With a sharp pen and a twisted plot, it depicts the ugly face of a cunning and vicious schemer, exposing the ugliness of such people from a human perspective.

▲ How do you strengthen management methods to seek new paths?

● Based on the separation of party and government, we implement the director responsibility system. The director fully exercises the right to manage within the scope of their authority and is fully responsible for the theatre. It's hard to be a director now! You have to manage both the business and act as a manager. I'm always thinking about "money" now. We also implement hierarchical and target management. The theatre, based on the principle of combining responsibility, authority, and benefits, delegates power, giving each department sufficient autonomy to manage. This ensures that things can be activated without losing control. The theatre issues mandatory tasks to each department based on the annual plan and signs contracts or agreements according to the situation.

▲ Why did you formally include the production of television dramas as a theatre art production project in the plan?

● Acting in plays and shooting television dramas are both means of artistic production and creating benefits, just in different forms. Shooting television can also train theatre actors, enhancing their sense of the camera and bringing the naturalness of television performance to the stage, making theatre performances more real and vivid. Shooting television can also solve the funding needed for stage plays and should be given equal attention.

▲ How do you utilize technical advantages to carry out various paid services and business activities?

● After the actor troupe completes the scheduled number of performances (100 per year) on time and with quality, they can implement item-by-item contracting, organize their own performances, and only need to pay the theatre 10,000 yuan per year. Other income can be decided by the contracting department. For example, after ensuring the design and production of the theatre's rehearsal plays, the stage design team has carried out paid services and business activities such as art decoration, furniture making, closed-circuit television decoration, and sewing children's clothing. They pay the theatre 30,000 yuan per year, and the rest is distributed by themselves. The television drama department also started the business of wedding videos. Although it has only been a few months, they are all very enthusiastic!

▲ Please talk about the benefits that contracting has brought to the theatre?

● The item-by-item contracting of the television drama "White Lotus Heroine" has shortened the shooting period, reduced costs, and improved quality. The entire drama has 4 episodes and over 1,000 shots. In the past, it would take a month to complete, but now it is completed in just 20 days, using only 140,000 yuan, which was impossible in the past. We watched the footage and thought it was good. For example, the children's drama troupe believes that children find it difficult to accept the form of theatre, so they presented a comprehensive program with both theatre and song and dance to primary school students, which was well-received. After contracting, the actors' sense of responsibility has increased, and they have creatively carried out artistic creation and performance according to the different needs of audiences at various levels.

▲ Can you talk about your plans for the future?

● In the future, we will produce some dubbed films and commercial films, strive to obtain distribution rights, and earn some money to invest in the filming of classics. Later, we may produce some good films, so the television drama department will enter a virtuous cycle. Now, many are units and factories that provide funds to shoot industry-specific films, with monotonous content, making it difficult to produce good films. This year, we plan to shoot 10 (episodes) of television dramas. If the situation is good, we can shoot 20 (episodes).

　　困顿·改革·活力
    ——与四川人民艺术剧院院长傅仁慧一席谈
    沈欣
    面对商品经济与其他艺术形式的挑战，话剧业陷于困顿之中。四川人艺——西南地区首屈一指的老牌话剧院，终于坠入低谷。四川人艺的出路何在？话剧剧种的生机在哪里？发展艺术生产的资金从哪儿来？……一个个炙人心手的问题困扰着这个院的领导和每一个演职人员。近来，听说他们在解决这些困难中取得了可喜的进展，于是我走访了四川人民艺术剧院院长傅仁慧。
    ▲你们剧院步履艰难，主要存在哪些问题？
    ●问题很多，主要有这样几个方面：一是人心涣散。演员觉得排戏是在搞无效劳动，排了半天演不了几场。不如拍电视，覆盖面大，在观众中的影响也大。总的说，话剧缺乏一种凝聚力。二是演职人员严重老化，中青年演员短缺。现在剧院离退休人员已近总人数的１／３，他们不能参加话剧生产，而优秀中青年演员又不易留住。由于话剧院比较清贫，有些年轻女演员进大公司当了“公关小姐”。另外，由于我省没有戏剧学校，后备力量不足。一些戏剧院校好的学生又不愿来四川，剧院也没有条件提供特别优厚待遇，这个问题最严重。三是资金紧缺。现有经费用于支付人头费后所剩无几，事业发展面临危机。四是艺术生产手段单一，话剧演出举步维艰。五是演出团队的闲置人员较多，这些人员的工资津贴仍由剧院统包统管，剧院包袱十分沉重。
    ▲这些问题您打算怎么解决？话剧是否会消亡？
    ●话剧处于低谷，不就等于消亡、不发展了，它总是要寻找新出路的。我们制订的《深化体制改革试行方案》可能是个转机，通过这个方案，我们想寻求一条生路，使话剧艺术重获生机，同时实行艺术生产力的转移，开辟一条发展话剧事业的广阔道路。
    ▲经济问题是困扰剧院的大问题，你们怎样处理经济效益与社会效益的关系？
    ●我们历来重视社会效益，尽量把它放在首位。今后我们将把握改革主旋律，认真选择剧目，着力抓一些能够产生社会影响的戏，力求在艺术上探索、创新，更好发挥剧院在话剧事业上的实验和示范作用。同时，还要注意解决选择剧目角度，开放度不够的问题，只要不是低级、丑陋的都可以演，这样内容就更广泛一些。比如，最近剧院大胆排演了根据日本当代著名推理小说改编的同名多场次话剧《荒诞世界》，以辛辣的笔调，曲折的情节，刻划了一个阴险毒辣的野心家的丑恶嘴脸，从人性高度上揭露了这类人的丑恶灵魂。
    ▲你们如何强化管理手段，寻求新的生路？
    ●我们在党政分开的基础上，实行院长负责制。院长在职权范围内充分行使经营自主权，对剧院全面负责。现在的院长很难当啊！既要管业务，还要当经理。我现在满脑子尽是“钱”。我们还实行了分级管理和目标管理。剧院按责、权、利三结合的原则，下放权力，使各部门有充分的经营自主权。做到既能搞活，又不失控。剧院根据年度计划，对下属各部门下达指令性任务，并根据情况签订承包合同或协议。
    ▲你们为什么正式将电视剧的生产作为剧院艺术生产项目纳入计划？
    ●演话剧、拍电视剧都是艺术生产和创造效益的手段，只是形式不同而已。拍电视还能使话剧演员得到锻炼，增强镜头感，把电视表演的自然化带到舞台上，使话剧表演更真实、更生动。拍电视还能解决舞台剧所需的资金，理应受到同样重视。
    ▲你们如何利用技术优势，开展各种有偿服务和经营活动？
    ●演员剧团在按时保质完成规定演出场次（每年１００场）后，可实行单项承包，自行组织演出活动，一年只需向剧院交１万元。其它收入，承包部门有权决定分配。如舞美队在保证剧院排演剧目的设计制作后，开展了美术装修营业、做家具、承担闭路电视装修、缝制儿童服装等有偿服务和经营活动。一年交剧院３万元，其余自行分配。电视剧部还开展新婚录像的业务，尽管才开始两个来月，它们都搞得挺来劲咧！
    ▲请您谈谈承包给剧院带来了哪些好处？
    ●电视剧《白莲女杰》的单项承包，使拍摄周期缩短，经费减少，质量提高。全剧４集，１０００多个镜头，过去一个月都拍不完，现在仅用２０天即完成，只用了１４万元，这在过去是根本办不到的。我们看了片，觉得不错。再如儿童剧团，他们认为话剧这种形式儿童不易接受，于是把一台既有话剧，又有歌舞的综合节目奉献给小学生，受到欢迎。承包以后，演员责任感增强，想方设法根据多种层次观众的不同需要，创造性地进行艺术创作与表演。
    ▲请您谈谈今后的打算好吗？
    ●今后再搞些译制片、商业片，争取能有发行权，赚点钱便能投入名著的拍摄。以后可能会产生一点好片子，这样电视剧部便转入了良性循环。现在很多是一些单位、厂家出钱，拍行业片，内容单调，不容易出好片子。我们今年准备拍１０部（集）电视剧，如果情况好，可拍２０部（集）。
