The frugal life of a municipal party secretary

New China News Agency reporters Meng Xianjun and Lü Fengpo

"Our country is not yet wealthy, and consciously living a frugal life is a necessary awareness for Chinese Communists in the 1980s." This is a firm belief held by Zhang Zhenhuan, the secretary of the Cangzhou Municipal Party Committee in Hebei Province.

Zhang Zhenhuan became the secretary of the Cangzhou Municipal Party Committee in 1984. After arriving in Cangzhou alone, he has consistently insisted on eating in the canteen with the staff, sharing the same meals. He rejects any special treatment for himself, believing that it is only natural to live the same way as the staff. When higher-level officials come with guests, he does not accompany them for meals. When working at the grassroots level, he does not eat the meals provided and pays according to the standard rates for food and grain tickets. Once, when he inspected work in Beitaoxing Township in Cang County, after the meal, the township officials insisted on not accepting payment. After returning to the office, he had his accompanying staff send the exact amount. He said, "If we open a small hole at the top, a big wind will blow at the bottom."

In recent years, Cangzhou's industrial and agricultural production has developed rapidly, and the economy is becoming increasingly prosperous. Last year, the State Council also listed the city as an open coastal city, attracting many visitors from the south and north. The municipal party committee planned to replace the 30-year-old office desks and chairs and clean up the rural atmosphere in the office. Zhang Zhenhuan learned of this and suggested that desks and chairs that can be repaired should be repaired and repainted for continued use, starting with himself. This alone saved the municipal party committee 100,000 yuan in fiscal expenditures. Someone with a keen eye did an interesting small survey: out of the 1,330 pieces of furniture and equipment in the municipal party committee, 41% have been in use for more than 28 years.

After arriving in Cangzhou, Zhang Zhenhuan, together with other comrades in the municipal party committee and government, made significant contributions to improving the city's water and electricity supply and road conditions. He also built beautiful apartment buildings for teachers and scientific and technological personnel. However, his own living conditions are quite modest. In 1985, the office arranged a unit of apartments for him, but he voluntarily gave it to other comrades and moved into a low, narrow warehouse in the office with a child. Last spring, due to construction and relocation, he moved into two rooms in the west wing. He has only recently moved into the office building.

When one's conduct is upright, orders are followed without being given. When one's conduct is not upright, even orders are not followed. Zhang Zhenhuan's conscious awareness of living a frugal life has made frugal management a prevailing trend in the municipal party committee. The municipal party committee currently has 6 cars, 3 of which are nearing the age for major repairs. In the past three years, the municipal party committee has not purchased a single luxury car.

Zhang Zhenhuan's clean and honest style has been praised by local officials and the masses. In September last year, the Office of the Hebei Provincial Party Committee reported to the entire province that the experience of the Cangzhou Municipal Party Committee in maintaining its own cleanliness is valuable in its self-awareness and peace of mind. In March this year, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee also commended Zhang Zhenhuan.

　　过俭朴日子的市委书记
    新华社记者  孟宪俊  吕风坡
    “国家还不富裕，自觉地过俭朴日子，是八十年代中国共产党人应有的觉悟。”这是河北沧州市委书记张震环的一条坚定信念。
    张震环是１９８４年任中共沧州市委书记的。他只身到沧州市后，一直坚持在机关职工食堂用餐，和大家吃一样的饭菜。他拒绝对他个人的任何特殊的照顾，认为生活上理所当然要和职工相同。上级来了客人，他不陪客吃饭。到基层工作，不吃招待饭，并按标准付钱和粮票。一次，他到沧县北桃杏乡检查工作，饭后付款时乡干部执意不收。回到机关后，他让随行的工作人员如数寄去。他说：“我们在上边开针尖大的孔，下边就会起斗大的风。”
    沧州市的工农业生产近几年发展较快，经济日趋繁荣。去年国务院又将该市列为沿海开放城市，南来北往的客人很多。市委机关打算更换一下３０年前的办公桌椅，洗一洗机关里的乡土气。张震环得知后，提出可维修的桌椅要维修、漆新，继续使用，并先从自己做起。仅此一项，市委机关就节省财政开支１０万元。有心人做过一个有趣的小统计，市委机关现有桌椅柜橱等设施１３３０件，使用过２８年以上的占４１％。
    张震环到沧州后，同市委、市政府其他同志一道，为改善城市的水电供应和道路状况，做出了贡献，还先后为教师和科技人员盖起了栋栋漂亮的宿舍楼。可是，他自己住的却很简陋。１９８５年机关为他安排了一个单元的楼房，他主动让给其他同志，自己与身边的一个孩子住进了机关一间低矮的库房里，去年春因基建拆迁他又搬进了两间西厢房里。最近才搬到机关办公楼。
    己身正，不令而行。己身不正，虽令不行。张震环过穷日子的自觉意识，使市委勤俭办事业蔚成风气。市委机关现有６辆小车，３辆已接近大修年龄。近３年时间，市委没有购置一辆豪华轿车。
    张震环清政廉洁的作风，受到当地干部和群众的好评。去年９月，中共河北省委办公厅通报全省，认为沧州市委保持自身清廉的经验，贵在自觉和心安。今年３月，河北省委又对张震环提出表扬。
