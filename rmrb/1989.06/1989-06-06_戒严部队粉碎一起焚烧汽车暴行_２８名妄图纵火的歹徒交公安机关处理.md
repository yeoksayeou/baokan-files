Martial Law Troops Foil an Arson Attempt on Buses
28 Arsonists Handed Over to Public Security Authorities

The Martial Law Command Headquarters announced today that early this morning, a certain unit of the martial law troops apprehended 28 counter-revolutionary thugs who attempted to set fire to public buses and handed them over to the public security authorities for processing.

According to the command headquarters, on June 5th, a gang of counter-revolutionary thugs, armed with gasoline, bottles, and other tools, infiltrated the Beijing Chaoyang District's He Ping Street North Bus Terminal. They used eight large buses to block nearby intersections, intending to set fire to 28 public buses parked there during the night. They openly shouted, "Anyone who dares to stop us will meet their end!" "We will paralyze Beijing's transportation!"

At 2:25 AM on June 6th, upon learning of this situation, a certain unit of the martial law troops immediately organized troops to advance towards He Ping Street. At 3:30 AM, just as the gang of counter-revolutionary thugs began to set fire, the People's Liberation Army suddenly appeared before them and fired warning shots. The thugs, upon seeing this, fled in all directions. The troops pursued and captured the thugs, while others rushed onto the buses to remove and destroy the gasoline bottles that had already been ignited but had not yet exploded. Twenty-eight thugs were captured on the spot. After the thugs' violent acts were foiled, the troops helped the bus fleet move the public buses to a safe location.

Mayor Chen Xitong called the martial law troops to express his gratitude on behalf of the Beijing Municipal Committee, the municipal government, and all the people of Beijing to the soldiers of the unit that foiled this counter-revolutionary violent act.

　　戒严部队粉碎一起焚烧汽车暴行
    ２８名妄图纵火的歹徒交公安机关处理
    新华社北京６月６日电  戒严部队指挥部发布消息说：今日凌晨戒严部队某部一举捕获２８名妄图焚烧公共汽车的反革命歹徒，交公安机关处理。
    据该指挥部宣布，６月５日，一伙反革命歹徒携带汽油、酒瓶等作案工具，窜至北京朝阳区和平街北口公共汽车终点站，用８辆大客车堵住附近路口，准备在夜间焚烧停放在那里的２８辆公共汽车。他们公然叫嚣：“谁敢来阻止，叫他有来无回！”“要让北京市交通瘫痪！”６日凌晨２点２５分，戒严部队某部得知这一情况后，立即组织部队向和平街疾进。３点３０分，正当这伙反革命歹徒开始纵火时，解放军突然出现在他们面前，并鸣枪示警。歹徒们见状四处逃窜。部队官兵有的追捕歹徒，有的冲上公共汽车，将已经燃烧还未爆炸的汽油瓶取出销毁。２８名歹徒被当场抓获。歹徒的暴行被粉碎后，部队官兵又帮助车队把公共汽车转移到安全地带。
    陈希同市长给戒严部队打电话，代表北京市委、市政府和全市人民向粉碎这起反革命暴行的某部官兵表示感谢。
