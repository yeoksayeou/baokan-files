A Polish climber, Ann Malczyniak, who successfully summited Mount Everest, was rescued after being stranded at the 1st camp at an altitude of 6,000 meters for four days. The Nepalese Ministry of Tourism announced today that the rescue team found Malczyniak this morning. It is expected that the Polish climber will arrive in Kathmandu the day after tomorrow. The rescue team consisted of one Pole, two New Zealanders, and two Nepalese. Due to an avalanche, the rescue team could not operate from the Nepal side, so the rescue was conducted from the Chinese side.

Malczyniak and four other Polish climbers reached the summit of Everest on May 25th. However, on their return journey to the 3rd camp at an altitude of 7,200 meters on May 27th, his four teammates were all killed in an avalanche. At that time, he took a safer ice slope and escaped unharmed, reaching the 1st camp the next night to await rescue.

　　波兰一登山者受困珠峰四天后得救
    新华社加德满都６月１日电  （记者印高乐）攀登珠峰成功的波兰人安·马尔齐尼亚克在海拔６０００米的１号营地受困４天后，今天得到营救。尼泊尔旅游部宣布这一消息时说，营救队伍是今天上午找到马尔齐尼亚克的，预计这名波兰人后天可抵达加德满都。这支营救队由一名波兰人、两名新西兰人和两名尼泊尔人组成。由于雪崩，营救队无法从尼泊尔一侧行动，所以，营救队是从中国一侧登山营救的。
    马尔齐尼亚克同另４名波兰登山者２５日登上珠峰。但在２７日返回海拔７２００米的３号营地途中，他的４名队友遇雪崩全部罹难。当时，他走的是另一条较安全的冰坡，幸免于难，并于次晚到达１号营地等待救援。
