Central Discipline Inspection Commission (CDIC) officials and all staff members have recently been studying and discussing Deng Xiaoping's important speech during his meeting with senior military officers of the Beijing martial law troops. They felt deeply educated and inspired.

On the afternoon of June 13 and the morning of June 14, CDIC Deputy Secretary Chen Zuolin convened two meetings—an expanded meeting of the CDIC and a meeting of the CDIC staff and cadres—to convey Deng Xiaoping's important speech. He urged all departments and administrative heads to organize the study thoroughly, using Deng Xiaoping's speech to unify everyone's thoughts and guide the work of the Party's disciplinary inspection in the struggle to completely suppress the counter-revolutionary riot.

The CDIC officials unanimously agreed that Deng Xiaoping's speech was concise yet profound, providing a deep analysis and thorough explanation of several major issues, including the inevitability, essence, and root causes of the counter-revolutionary riot, the major decisions made by the Party Central Committee and the State Council to suppress the riot, the significant role played by the older generation of revolutionaries and the People's Liberation Army in this struggle, and the line, principles, and policies established by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, as well as the "one center, two basic points" summarized by the Thirteenth Party Congress. These insights will play a significant guiding role in unifying the thoughts of the entire Party, the military, and the people of the nation, and in working together to build a modernized country.

The officials also believed that Deng Xiaoping's timely affirmation of the line, principles, and policies established by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, and his reaffirmation of the "one center, two basic points" summarized by the Thirteenth Party Congress, are highly necessary. This will greatly boost the confidence of the entire Party and the people of the nation, helping them to continue with reform and opening up, and to work together to achieve the Party's basic line.

Through the study and discussion, the staff members deepened their understanding to varying degrees. The majority of the comrades further clarified the situation, distinguished right from wrong, and expressed their determination to stand firm, maintain high unity with the Party Central Committee, and resolutely fight against the few rioters.

The National People's Congress (NPC) Party Group, the Supreme People's Court, and the Supreme People's Procuratorate recently held meetings with their Party members and cadres to convey and study Deng Xiaoping's important speech during his meeting with senior military officers of the Beijing martial law troops. They believed that the speech expressed the wishes of the people of the nation.

On the morning of June 14, the NPC Party Group held a meeting with Party members who are NPC Standing Committee members and members of specialized committees in Beijing, as well as all Party members and cadres of the NPC apparatus. On behalf of Wan Li, Peng Chong presided over the meeting and spoke. He said that Deng Xiaoping's important speech, made at a critical moment for the Party and the state, profoundly explained the nature of this struggle. It is a struggle from turmoil to a counter-revolutionary riot, aiming to overthrow the Communist Party, the socialist system, and our republic, and to establish a completely Westernized bourgeois republic. This speech, with its high-level perspective and far-sighted vision, is of great importance in unifying the thoughts of the entire Party and the people of the nation, achieving a comprehensive victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot and turmoil, and fundamentally stabilizing the current situation.

Peng Chong said that Deng Xiaoping pointed out that in terms of political system reform, one thing can be affirmed: we will adhere to the people's congress system, not the Western-style separation of powers. This is very important. We, the Communist Party members and all cadres in the NPC work, must, under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, uphold the dignity of the Constitution and the law, and work hard to develop socialist democracy and improve socialist legal system, to further improve the people's congress system, and make new contributions.

Members of the NPC Party Group, Liao Hansheng, Chen Muhua, Wang Hanbin, and Cao Zhi attended the meeting.

On the morning of June 14, the Supreme People's Court held a meeting with all Party members and cadres. Ren Jianxin, President of the Supreme People's Court, said at the meeting that Deng Xiaoping's important speech is programmatic and of great significance. It not only summarized the initial victory of suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot but also pointed the direction for achieving a comprehensive victory in the future. It not only summarized the basic experiences and lessons of the Party since the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee but also pointed the direction for further implementing the line, principles, and policies established by the Thirteenth Party Congress, which is the "one center, two basic points."

He said that while studying Deng Xiaoping's speech thoroughly, all levels of people's courts should focus on judicial work and other tasks, fulfill the sacred duties entrusted by the Constitution, and strive to complete the various tasks proposed in the "Report on the Work of the Supreme People's Court" approved by the Second Session of the Seventh National People's Congress. The current focus of work is to promptly try and judicially sentence those who committed serious criminal offenses such as beating, smashing, looting, arson, and killing, as well as counter-revolutionary criminals in this counter-revolutionary riot and turmoil. We should link the situation in Beijing and the rest of the country with the actual situation of our institution and each individual's thoughts and work, and carry out in-depth and detailed ideological and political work, to improve the ideological understanding of all judicial personnel, improve our work, and contribute to the rectification and reform, opening up, strengthening socialist democracy and legal system, and socialist modernization construction.

Since June 12, the Party Group of the Supreme People's Procuratorate has begun to convey and study Deng Xiaoping's important speech during his meeting with senior military officers of the Beijing martial law troops. On June 13, a meeting was held with all Party members and cadres of the institution. On the mornings of June 14, 15, and 16, an expanded meeting of the Party Group was held. Procurator-General Liu Fuzhi said at the meeting: Deng Xiaoping once again, at a critical moment for the Party and the state, pointed the direction for the Party's advance. His important speech not only deeply analyzed the causes, nature, and purposes of the Beijing counter-revolutionary riot but also pointed out our Party's firm stance on this incident. It also pointed out that our Party will firmly adhere to the four cardinal principles and the direction of reform and opening up. Deng Xiaoping's speech is the guiding ideology for our Party in the current and future long-term period and is a programmatic document of the Party.

The comrades of the Supreme People's Procuratorate expressed their firm support for Deng Xiaoping's speech during the study and discussion and vowed to implement it in their work, contributing to the strengthening of people's democratic dictatorship and socialist legal system.

    ６月１３日下午和次日上午，中央纪委副书记陈作霖分别召开常委扩大会议和机关党员、干部大会，传达小平同志的重要讲话，要求机关各厅室党组织和行政负责人认真组织好这次学习，用小平同志的重要讲话统一大家的思想，指导开展彻底平息反革命暴乱斗争中的党的纪律检查工作。
    中央纪委常委一致认为，小平同志的重要讲话言简意赅，寓意深刻，对发生这场反革命暴乱的必然性、实质和根源，对党中央、国务院平息反革命暴乱采取的重大决策，对老一辈革命家和人民解放军在这场斗争中起的重大作用以及党的十一届三中全会制定的路线、方针、政策和党的十三大概括的“一个中心、两个基本点”等几个重大问题，都作了精辟地分析、深刻地阐述和充分地肯定。这对于统一全党、全军和全国人民的思想，同心同德进行四化建设，都将起重大指导作用。
    常委们还认为，小平同志在平息反革命暴乱后及时肯定党的十一届三中全会制定的路线、方针、政策和提出的战略目标，重申党的十三大概括的“一个中心、两个基本点”，这是十分必要的，对于坚定全党、全国人民的信心，继续搞好改革开放，齐心协力地为实现党的基本路线而奋斗，有着极其重要的意义。

    １４日上午，全国人大党组召开在京党员人大常委会委员和专门委员会委员以及人大机关全体党员干部会，受万里同志委托，彭冲同志主持会议并讲了话。他说，小平同志在党和国家命运处于严峻时刻作的这个重要讲话，深刻地阐明了这场斗争的性质，是从动乱发展成为反革命暴乱，其实质是要推翻共产党，推翻社会主义制度，颠覆我们的共和国，建立一个完全西方化的资产阶级共和国。这个讲话高屋建瓴，高瞻远瞩，对于统一全党和全国人民的思想，夺取平息反革命暴乱和平息动乱的全面胜利，从根本上稳定当前局势，有着极为重要的意义。
    彭冲说，小平同志指出，在政治体制改革方面，有一点可以肯定，就是我们要坚持实行人民代表大会制度，而不是西方式的三权鼎立制度。这一点非常重要。我们在人大工作的共产党员和全体干部，一定要在党中央的领导下，维护宪法和法律的尊严，为发展社会主义民主、健全社会主义法制，为继续完善人民代表大会制度，努力工作，作出新的贡献。

    他说，在学好邓小平同志讲话的同时，各级人民法院要认真抓好审判工作和其他各项工作，履行宪法赋予我们的神圣职责，努力完成经七届全国人大二次会议批准的《最高人民法院工作报告》中提出的各项任务。当前工作的重点，是及时审理、依法判处在这次反革命暴乱和动乱中进行打、砸、抢、烧、杀的严重刑事犯罪分子和反革命犯罪分子。要联系北京和全国的形势，联系本机关的实际和每个人的思想、工作实际，进行深入细致的思想政治工作，以提高法院全体干警的思想认识，改进我们的工作，为治理整顿、改革开放、加强社会主义民主和法制，为社会主义现代化建设，做出应有的贡献。
