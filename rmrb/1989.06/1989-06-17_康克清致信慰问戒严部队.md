Steadfastly uphold the leadership of the Party, uphold the socialist system, and safeguard the fundamental interests of the people of all nationalities in the country. The martial law troops command headquarters news office reports: On June 16, the martial law troops command headquarters received a letter of comfort from Kang Keqing, chairman of the Soong Ching Ling Foundation, to all officers and soldiers of the martial law troops. The full text is as follows:

Dear officers and soldiers of the martial law troops:

Hello! You have worked hard!

Under the leadership of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, together with the capital's armed police officers and public security police, you have made special contributions in suppressing this shocking counter-revolutionary riot. As an old Red Army soldier, my heart has always been with you. Because of my old age and recent illness, I have not been able to visit you in person. I hereby express my sincere comfort and high respect to you on behalf of myself and all the staff of the Soong Ching Ling Foundation, as well as the hundreds of millions of young people and children across the country. I also express my deep sorrow to the martyrs who sacrificed their lives and my heartfelt condolences to their families. I wish the injured comrades a speedy recovery.

The facts have proven that the political turmoil and the subsequent counter-revolutionary bloody riot planned by a small number of conspirators aimed to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China, overthrow our socialist system, and subvert the People's Republic of China. You have carried forward the glorious revolutionary traditions of the old Red Army and the Eighth Route Army, with strict discipline and iron will, bearing hardships and fears, selflessly and fearlessly, achieving a great victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot. Thus, you have saved the People's Republic, safeguarded the fundamental interests of the people of all nationalities in the country, and safeguarded the socialist mountains and rivers won with the blood of tens of millions of martyrs. The people of the whole country will forever thank you, and millions of mothers and children will forever thank you. Your great achievements will be forever recorded in the annals of the People's Republic.

Although the international situation has eased somewhat today, and the land of China has seen a good situation of reform and opening up and stability and unity, the hostile forces at home and abroad have not stopped for a day in their attempts to overthrow the leadership of our great Party and subvert the socialist People's Republic. Your heroic deeds have powerfully exposed the conspiracies of the enemy at home and abroad, dealt a heavy blow to their reactionary arrogance, and greatly aroused the political vigilance of the broad masses of the people and their revolutionary enthusiasm to adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, adhere to reform and opening up, and build modernization.

You are the most beloved people of the new generation. You are indeed the people's children, indeed the iron Great Wall of the socialist motherland, and have once again set a shining example for our new generation of young people to love the Party, love the people, and love the socialist motherland. They will forever learn from you.

Comrades, Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech during his reception of the capital's martial law troops' military and above-level leading cadres has summarized the historical experience of this struggle for the whole Party, the whole army, and the people of the whole country, and pointed out the direction for the People's Republic to continue to advance.

Let the whole Party, the whole army, and the people of the whole country be further united under the banner of our great Party, and march forward bravely on the broad avenue of socialism!

	Kang Keqing
	Chairman, Soong Ching Ling Foundation
	June 16, 1989

　　康克清致信慰问戒严部队
    新华社北京６月１７日电  戒严部队指挥部新闻处消息：６月１６日，戒严部队指挥部收到了宋庆龄基金会主席康克清给戒严部队全体官兵的慰问信，全文如下：
    亲爱的戒严部队全体官兵同志们：
    你们好！你们辛苦了！
    在党中央、国务院和中央军委的领导下，你们和首都武警官兵、公安干警一道，在平息这场骇人听闻的反革命暴乱中，立下了特殊的功勋。我作为一名老红军战士，我的心一直和你们连在一起。只因为年纪大了，最近又有病，未能亲自前去看望你们，谨以此信，代表我个人和宋庆龄基金会的全体同志，以及全国亿万少年儿童向你们致以亲切的慰问和崇高的敬意，向牺牲的烈士表示沉痛的哀悼，并向他们的家属表示深切的慰问。祝受伤的同志们早日康复。
    事实证明，极少数阴谋分子策划的这场政治动乱和由此发展的反革命血腥暴乱，其罪恶目的是妄图推翻中国共产党的领导，推翻我国的社会主义制度，颠覆中华人民共和国。你们发扬当年老红军和老八路的光荣革命传统，以严明的纪律和钢铁的意志，忍辱负重，无私无畏，取得了平息反革命暴乱的重大胜利，从而挽救了人民共和国，保卫了全国各族人民的根本利益，保卫了用几千万烈士的鲜血换来的社会主义江山。全国人民将永远感谢你们，亿万母亲和少年儿童将永远感谢你们。你们的丰功伟绩将永载人民共和国的史册。
    虽然当今国际紧张局势有所缓和，神州大地也出现了改革开放与安定团结的大好形势，但国内外的敌对势力没有一天不妄想推翻我们伟大的党的领导，颠覆社会主义的人民共和国。你们的英雄行动，有力地揭露了国内外敌人的阴谋，狠狠地打击了他们的反动气焰，大大激发了广大人民的政治警惕性和一往无前坚持四项原则、坚持改革开放和建设四化的革命热情。
    你们是新一代的最可爱的人。你们不愧为人民的子弟兵，不愧为社会主义祖国的钢铁长城，又一次为我们新一代少年儿童树立了热爱党、热爱人民、热爱社会主义祖国的光辉榜样。他们将永远向你们学习。
    同志们，小平同志在接见首都戒严部队军以上领导干部时的重要讲话，为全党、全军、全国人民总结了这场斗争的历史经验，指明了人民共和国继续前进的方向。
    让全党、全军、全国人民进一步团结起来，在我们伟大的党的旗帜下，沿着社会主义的康庄大道奋勇前进！
