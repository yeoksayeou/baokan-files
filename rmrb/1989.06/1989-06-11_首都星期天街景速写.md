Beijing residents today spent the first Sunday after the suppression of the counter-revolutionary riot in a peaceful and calm atmosphere.

Reporters in bustling areas such as Wangfujing, Xidan, and Dongsi saw that most shops, large and small, were open for business, and the number of customers shopping had noticeably increased. A young mother pushing a stroller told the reporter that she had been wanting to buy a pair of shoes for her child but had not dared to go out during the previous days of disorder. Today, she finally managed to buy them.

The Sunday markets and some state-run vegetable stores were bustling and busy. Fresh seasonal vegetables like cucumbers, green beans, eggplants, and tomatoes filled the shelves. Despite the large number of shoppers, there were no long lines or signs of panic buying.

Individual vendors who had been less active in recent days were back on the streets of Beijing; residents could hear the calls of scrap collectors; and the smell of grilled lamb skewers once again filled the air.

The usually quiet park on Dongdajie had returned to its normal atmosphere: retired workers gathered in groups to play cards and chess, with many onlookers. Under the shade of the trees, elderly couples and young lovers sat on the benches. An auntie accompanied a few children, swinging on the swings and playing in the cradle...

On the streets, people no longer looked frightened or anxious when soldiers with guns passed by. The soldiers of the martial law troops, despite their fatigue, vigilantly patrolled various key locations in the capital.

　　首都星期天街景速写
    本报北京６月１１日讯  首都市民今天在平和安然的氛围中，度过了平息反革命暴乱后的第一个星期天。
    记者在王府井、西单、东四等繁华闹市区，看到大小商店基本上开门营业，前来购买物品的顾客明显增多。一位推着小童车的年轻母亲对记者说，她一直想给孩子买双鞋，前几天秩序不正常，没敢上街，今天总算买上了。
    星期日的集贸市场和一些国营菜店，显得兴旺与繁忙。带刺的黄瓜、鲜嫩的豆角、紫黑发亮的茄子、透红的西红柿等一些时令蔬菜，摆满货架。尽管选购的人多，但未见有排长队，也看不到有抢购的现象。
    前几天一些不大出门的个体摊贩，又纷纷出现在首都的街头；居民区不时响起收废品的吆喝声；烤羊肉串的烟气和香味又在空气中弥漫。
    一度冷落的东大桥街头公园，又恢复往常的气氛：退休的老工人三一群五一伙在打扑克，下象棋，围观的人也很多。绿荫丛中的椅子上，坐着老年夫妇和一些谈情说爱的年轻人。一位阿姨带着几个儿童，荡秋千、玩摇篮……
    在大街上，人们对从身边走过的挎枪战士，不再有惊恐不安的神色。戒严部队的战士，不顾疲劳，警惕地巡逻在首都各个保卫目标。
