Thai Prime Minister Chatchai Chunhawan today said that Thailand will adopt a flexible and constructive foreign policy to adapt to the changes in the contemporary world.

Chatchai made these remarks at the opening ceremony of the "Discussion on Economic and Trade Relations between Thailand and Indochina."

He said that in today's world, "the lines of division are no longer as clear as they used to be. Formerly hostile countries are striving to remove barriers between them, seeking ways to control and eliminate differences and strengthen cooperation." "Countries are increasingly focusing on economic issues and are becoming more interdependent in economic and technological matters."

Chatchai said that, in response to these changes, he has been seeking ways to adjust Thailand's various policies since taking office as Prime Minister, so that they better reflect the changes in the world and more effectively safeguard the interests of the Thai people.

When discussing foreign policies that have close political, trade, and investment relations with Thailand, Chatchai emphasized the need to "accelerate cooperation with other ASEAN neighbors and to live in peace with the Indochina countries." He said that Thailand must also develop economic relations with countries that have not yet established close economic ties.

Chatchai also stressed in his speech that Vietnamese troops must withdraw from Cambodia. "If Vietnam does not withdraw its troops, Cambodia will never achieve true and lasting peace."

The "Discussion on Economic and Trade Relations between Thailand and Indochina" was organized by the Political Science Association of Thammasat University. Its purpose is to enable participants to understand Thailand's political and economic policies and Thailand's relations with the Indochina countries. Approximately 300 officials and scholars from various Thai government departments attended the discussion.

　　差猜总理说
    泰将采取建设性对外政策
    新华社曼谷６月１０日电  （记者张秋来）泰国总理差猜·春哈旺今天说，泰国将采取灵活和富有建设性的对外政策，以适应当今世界的变化。
    差猜是在这里举行的“泰国同印支之间的经贸关系”讨论会的开幕式讲话中说这番话的。
    他说，在当今世界上，“分裂的界线已不像过去那样明显，曾经是敌对的国家纷纷努力拆除他们之间的藩篱，寻找途径控制和消除分歧和加强合作。”“各国日益重视经济问题，在经济和技术方面越来越相互依赖。”
    差猜说，面对这种变化，他自从就任总理以后，就一直在寻求途径修正泰国的各种政策方针，以便使之更大程度地真正符合世界的变化和更好地维护泰国人民的利益。
    在谈到同泰国在政治、贸易、投资等方面有着密切关系的外交政策时，差猜强调“必须加速同其它东盟邻国之间的合作，并同印支国家和平共处。”他说，泰国还必须同尚未建立起密切经济往来的国家发展经济关系。
    差猜在讲话中还强调说，越南军队必须撤出柬埔寨。如果越南“不撤军，柬埔寨就永远不能实现真正的、持久的和平”。
    “泰国同印支之间经贸关系”讨论会是由泰国法正大学的政治科学协会举办的，其目的是使与会者了解泰国的政治和经济政策以及泰国与印支国家之间的关系。来自泰国政府各部门官员及学者约３００人参加了讨论会。
