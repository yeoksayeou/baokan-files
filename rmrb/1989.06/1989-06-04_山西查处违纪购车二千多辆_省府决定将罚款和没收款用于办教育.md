A fleet of 2,700 small cars would be quite an impressive sight. All of these vehicles were purchased in violation of state regulations. This is just the number of illegally purchased cars uncovered during Shanxi Province's 1988 inspection to control the purchasing power of social groups.

The Shanxi Provincial People's Government has made a decision on how to handle these vehicles: the proceeds from the confiscated vehicles and fines will be used to increase educational funding. Local and municipal authorities will form appraisal committees consisting of personnel from the control office, materials, and commerce departments to propose handling measures. After approval by the local government, the vehicles will be reappraised and sold to units approved by the control purchasing management agency or to individuals. To avoid the situation where "one person gets sick, and everyone takes medicine," the decision also stipulates that for fines, enterprises and units with income should allocate funds from their own resources, not spread into costs. Other administrative and public institutions must pay from their extra-budgetary funds, and local finances will not provide additional allocations. The profits from the sale of the vehicles will also be fully confiscated.

According to relevant personnel, if the execution is firm, at least 50 million yuan will be added to the educational investment.

　　山西查处违纪购车二千多辆
    省府决定将罚款和没收款用于办教育
    本报太原６月４日电  记者阎晓明报道：用２７００辆小汽车组成一个车队，可能是一个相当壮观的车队。这些车全部是违反国家有关规定购置的。这仅仅是山西省１９８８年控制社会集团购买力大检查中查出的违纪购置小车数。
    山西省人民政府已对这批车的处理做出决定：将没收车辆的变价款和罚款用于增加教育经费。各地市没收的车辆，由各地市控办、物资、工商等部门组成评议小组提出处理意见，经当地政府批准后，重新作价出售给经控购管理机关批准的单位使用，或销售给个人。为避免“一人感冒，大家吃药”，这项决定还规定，对于罚款，企业和有收入的单位从自有资金中列支，不准摊入成本，其它行政、事业单位一律在其预算外资金中支付，各财政不予追加拨款。对销售汽车单位，也将全部没收其销售利润。
    据有关人士估计，如果执行坚决的话，至少有５０００万元的资金增加到教育投资中去。
