For "Voice of America" Providing Lies
Zhang Weiping Apprehended

Xinhua News Agency, Hangzhou, June 19th - (Reporter Hu Hongwei) According to information provided by the Hangzhou Public Security Bureau: During the turmoil in Hangzhou, the lawbreaker Zhang Weiping, who fabricated the lie that the "Zhejiang Provincial Government lowered the flag to half-mast to mourn the deceased students in Beijing" and provided it to "Voice of America" for broadcast, was apprehended by the public security authorities yesterday afternoon in Jiashan County, Zhejiang Province.

According to relevant departments, on the morning of June 5th around 11:00, some students from the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts marched to the front gate of the Zhejiang Provincial Government. To dissuade the marching students from entering the government building and to ensure the normal work order of the office, relevant personnel temporarily closed the iron gate. The students gathered at the gate and caused a commotion. At this time, someone in the crowd shouted, "Lower the flag, lower the flag!" A student wearing a white short-sleeved T-shirt climbed to the top of the gate tower near the flagpole and began to untie the flag rope. Unable to lower the flag immediately, the student forcefully shook the flagpole and tore off a piece of the national flag, leaving it hanging crookedly on the flagpole. The provincial government staff and some onlookers present at the scene expressed great indignation.

The next day, Zhang Weiping, a student from the Chinese Painting Department of the Zhejiang Academy of Fine Arts, fabricated lies claiming that the "Provincial Government lowered the flag to half-mast to mourn the deceased students in Beijing," and so on. He also reported this lie to a "Voice of America" reporter via telephone. On June 6th, "Voice of America" broadcasted this fabricated story.

After being apprehended, Zhang Weiping admitted to his crime of spreading false information. It is understood that the case is currently under investigation.

　　为“美国之音”提供谎言
    张伟平被缉拿归案
    新华社杭州６月１９日电  （记者胡宏伟）据杭州市公安局提供的消息：在杭州动乱期间，制造所谓“浙江省政府为北京死难学生下半旗志哀”这一谎言并提供给“美国之音”广播的不法分子张伟平，已于昨天下午，在浙江省嘉善县被公安部门缉拿归案。
    据有关部门介绍，６月５日上午１１时许，浙江美术学院一些学生游行来到浙江省政府前大门。为了劝阻游行学生进入省政府大楼，保证机关正常的工作秩序，有关工作人员暂时关闭了铁栅大门。学生们聚集在大门前起哄。这时，人群中有人叫喊：“下半旗，下半旗！”一个身穿白色短袖体恤衫的学生翻爬到门楼顶部旗杆旁，动手解开升旗绳索。因一时拉不下，这个学生就用力摇晃旗杆，猛力把国旗扯下一截，斜歪在旗杆上。当时在场的省政府工作人员和一些群众对此表示了极大的愤慨。
    浙江美术学院国画系学生张伟平第二天编造谎言称，“省政府为北京死难学生下了半旗以表示哀悼”等等。他还通过电话把这则谎言报送给了“美国之音”记者。６月６日“美国之音”播出了这篇谎言。
    张伟平被缉拿归案后对自己造谣惑众的罪行供认不讳。据悉，此案正在审理中。
