Bold and Precious Exploration
— Reading Yu Zhi'an's "Walking Out of the Narrow Path"
Dong Fuqin

Yu Zhi'an is a renowned entrepreneur in China. His achievements are well-known to many people in the country. Recently, I read his book "Walking Out of the Narrow Path," which gave me a deeper understanding of how he achieved such great success.

He is not a professional economic theorist, but he wrote this economic book based on his practical experience. We cannot demand that his book be as conceptually accurate, logically rigorous, or theoretically comprehensive as works by professional economic theorists. However, his book summarizes his own experiences, is profound and vivid, and full of life. Therefore, only he could write such a book.

After reading this book, I believe that in the following three aspects, the book is written with considerable depth.

First, regarding the qualities of an entrepreneur

Yu Zhi'an is an entrepreneur who has overcome many hardships and finally achieved great success. It is natural that he talks about the qualities of an entrepreneur, making his discussion more profound. In the book, there are many very insightful discussions that could not have been written by someone without practical experience. At the same time, some of his discussions share common ground with domestic and international economists' discussions on entrepreneurial spirit. From his discussions, the essential qualities of an entrepreneur can be summarized as follows:

(1) Possessing a pioneering and innovative spirit of progress. According to the theory of the American economist Joseph Schumpeter, entrepreneurial spirit is the spirit of innovation. Without a pioneering and innovative spirit of progress, one cannot become an entrepreneur, let alone an excellent entrepreneur. In Yu Zhi'an's book, this spirit of never being satisfied and constantly innovating is evident. He writes: "With the ever-changing market competition, enterprises should continuously promote technological progress, develop new products based on new technologies, expand operations, and make the enterprise's satisfaction of market or social needs increasingly greater and better. I always remind myself to be vigilant in times of peace. Now that the product is selling well, we should not be satisfied; we should continue to develop more popular and competitive products to pursue and occupy the ever-changing social needs in a broader field" (p. 102).

(2) Possessing a spirit of not fearing pressure and daring to take risks. In the ever-changing market competition, for an entrepreneur to achieve victory, one must not fear the pressure of competition and dare to take the risks of competition. Yu Zhi'an says: "Whether one can become a strong and victorious competitor in the competition where benefits and risks coexist first depends on how one deals with pressure. A true competitor should not fear pressure and should not avoid pressure because pressure is often the source of strength." He even believes: if the pressure is insufficient, I advocate introducing pressure. "Introducing pressure is to digest pressure, increase pressure, and compete better" (p. 19). He himself does this. He proactively cut off the path of asking the state for money to carry out technological transformation and merged some long-term loss-making enterprises to introduce pressure. He is right in saying: "The ability to bear risks should be considered a necessary condition for an entrepreneur," "those who do not dare to take risks, are timid, and are yes-men, cannot become true entrepreneurs" (p. 96). This is absolutely true. Successful entrepreneurs at home and abroad all possess the fearless spirit of daring to do and dare to take risks.

(3) Being good at seizing opportunities and making decisions. In the face of great risks, how to turn danger into opportunity and overcome risks is the key. In the book, Yu Zhi'an has many excellent and unique discussions on this. For example, any enterprise leader will face opportunities, but not everyone can recognize and utilize opportunities. When there is an opportunity, one must seize it in time, as many opportunities are fleeting. Therefore, one must be good at making decisions, making cautious yet decisive decisions. He says: "When deciding whether to decide, the opportunity to develop the enterprise is lost," "success may turn into failure, and losing the opportunity may make it difficult to seize it again" (pp. 109, 111). Then, why do some enterprise leaders hesitate and miss opportunities? One reason, as Yu Zhi'an says, is that "opportunities, in many cases, appear with difficulties" (p. 108). Therefore, hesitation in the face of opportunities is actually weakness and timidity in the face of difficulties. Such enterprise leaders naturally cannot become true entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs are entrepreneurs precisely because they have the courage to challenge difficulties and precisely because they use correct decisions to overcome risks and achieve victory. At the same time, entrepreneurs should also be good at combining personal decisions with collective wisdom.

(4) Possessing high management abilities. Schumpeter regards entrepreneurs as organizers and promoters of the new combination of production factors, and making production factors recombine is part of the content of entrepreneurial spirit. Yu Zhi'an's view is in line with this. He says: "The most important quality of an entrepreneur should be the ability to, through his efforts, make various production factors reach optimal combination, and then carry out production activities most effectively" (p. 96). This is the embodiment of an entrepreneur's management abilities.

(5) Possessing a strong sense of duty and a spirit of dedication to society. This is a quality of outstanding entrepreneurs today. For socialist entrepreneurs, it is necessary to advocate the unremitting pursuit of the cause and the spirit of dedication to the country and the collective, and to make contributions to the revitalization of China to the best of one's abilities. He proposes: "One should balance the scales of giving and taking" (p. 107). If a factory director lacks the spirit of dedication and is obsessed with personal fame and gain, seeking personal interests with power, then "not only will it ruin oneself, but it will also ruin an enterprise" (p. 105). These views are very pertinent and are heartfelt words, worthy of being a warning to enterprise leaders.

Second, regarding the way of enterprise operation

The entire book talks about the way of operation. Here, I will focus on the aspects that Yu Zhi'an has the deepest understanding of.

(1) Enterprise operators must always pay attention to changes in market demand, be innovative, and strive to open up the market. In Yu Zhi'an's words: the way to win in competition is to "aim at the target market, change towards the direction of special fields that others have not yet developed, and leap to become a leader in the new field" (p. 85). One should "exploit strengths, avoid weaknesses, and develop new products that are unique" (p. 2). It can be said that this is a management skill that Chinese enterprise leaders who have long lived under the material economic order lack, but it must be learned and mastered in the commodity economic order. Yu Zhi'an has vividly and concretely explained this with his own experiences in the book.

(2) Enterprise operators must pay attention to efficiency, adhere to the path of technological progress, and strive to achieve the overall goal of enterprise operation behavior of "less input, more output." Chinese enterprise leaders have become accustomed to a set of methods under the existing system, that is, to increase production, they ask the state for investment. It seems that enterprises cannot have momentum without adding new equipment and investing in construction. Because this method is easier than innovating technology. Yu Zhi'an calls it a "superstition" that should be broken. He insists on taking a "shortcut" of relying on technological progress to develop productivity, which is the path of "less input, more output," and it can cure "investment hunger." He believes: traditional investment theory concepts and habits have seriously hindered enterprises from exerting internal efforts, affecting enterprises' enthusiasm for tapping potential and transformation, and improving economic benefits. He lists the various drawbacks of traditional methods. Yu Zhi'an's experience and unique insights in this regard have universal practical significance for Chinese enterprises.

(3) Enterprise operators must be good at coordinating and controlling the complex interpersonal relationships within the enterprise, tapping the full potential of people, which is a difficult problem that many enterprises have not solved. Yu Zhi'an proposes to bring out the "aggregation effect of people" and to "activate" people. He says that factory directors and managers not only need to have the ability and courage to open up operations but also need to have the good quality of being able to inspire and mobilize the intelligence of employees, to "activate" people, and to bring infinite vitality to the enterprise. In this regard, he indeed has a set of good proposals and methods, for example, in his eyes, there are no "useless people"; one should "use people's strengths"; "on the basis of management, be strict," so that employees "truly feel that they are closely related to the factory and that their fate is connected" (p. 76); one should rely on the two wings of intellectuals and workers to make the enterprise soar. A good enterprise leader must first rectify himself to bring out a strong team of employees, with righteousness to overcome evil, then righteousness prevails, the factory's wind is correct, people's hearts are united, and the strength is great; etc. I think that in his experiences, there are contents that can constitute an "enterprise culture" and enterprise management methods suitable for China's traditions, which are worth our consideration and study.

(4) Enterprise operators must be good at formulating enterprise development strategies and measures that suit the actual situation of the enterprise within the scope of national policies. This is one of the most important conditions for the success of an enterprise. A truly capable entrepreneur not only has the ability to operate an enterprise but also must inject a strong "policy" awareness into the operation and management, doing well in correctly understanding and executing national and regional policies while being good at formulating some policy-oriented measures and methods. In this regard, Yu Zhi'an has many insights and experiences and applies them in practice, making the enterprises he operates achieve remarkable results.

Third, regarding the external environment of the enterprise

Even if the enterprise leader has many qualities of an entrepreneur and understands the way of enterprise operation, if there is no suitable external environment, it will be difficult for him to become a true entrepreneur and operate the enterprise well. This is the situation under the traditional material economic system. Yu Zhi'an is right in saying, "In a society and historical conditions where commodity economy is not implemented, there is no competition or competition is not allowed, it indeed does not have the basic conditions for running an enterprise well, and it is naturally difficult to cultivate true entrepreneurs. This means that the survival and development of entrepreneurs need an objective environment" (p. 97). Yu Zhi'an has worked in enterprises for decades and knows well that to create a necessary external environment, economic system reform is needed. The insights on reform he proposes from his many years of personal experience are naturally quite pertinent. I would like to emphasize the following points:

(1) Developing the commodity economy. He believes this is the fundamental aspect of the objective environment. Because if the commodity economy is not developed, the market and competition will not exist; and without the market and competition, there will be no survival of the fittest, and enterprises and entrepreneurs will have no external pressure and no stage for activities, and it will not be possible to implement the way of operation that matches the commodity economy.

(2) Establishing an environment of equal competition. That is, letting enterprises compete on the same starting line. Regarding this, Yu Zhi'an believes: the serious drawbacks of the traditional classification of enterprise levels must be eliminated, and the special treatment enjoyed by some enterprises due to their affiliation and superior innate conditions should be abolished. It is not allowed for any unit or individual to interfere with competition by abusing their power, violating policies and laws, and it is even less allowed for bureaucratic monopolies to oppose competition. Of course, in addition to this, it is also necessary to reform the price system and other system issues.

(3) Separating government and enterprise, so that the enterprise can enjoy full autonomy. This is to make the enterprise get rid of various interferences from administrative departments and be able to operate autonomously. Yu Zhi'an says that the "affiliation relationship" should be "diluted" until the enterprise can operate autonomously under the condition of having no "mother-in-law," no superior, no interference, and only being constrained by policies, guidelines, and laws. He believes that the government "managing enterprises only needs one magic weapon, that is, the 'tightening spell' of the Tang Monk," the so-called "tightening spell" is "replacing administrative command with legal regulation" (p. 31). For this, it is necessary to formulate various regulations that are conducive to forming a good external environment and conducive to the autonomous operation of enterprises.

Yu Zhi'an applies these ideas to the internal management of Changjiang Power Company, establishing the principle of "managing without managing," and achieving success. Of course, for the whole society, the situation is much more complicated than the relationship between various enterprises within a company and between the company and the enterprises. But some principles are still the same.

In summary, Yu Zhi'an's "Walking Out of the Narrow Path" is a meaningful and valuable book. Not only is it worth reading for those who do practical economic work (especially enterprise leaders), but it is also worth reading for those who engage in economic theory work.

　　大胆而可贵的探索    
    ——读于志安的《走出夹缝》
    董辅礽
    于志安同志是我国著名的企业家。他的业绩已为国内许多人所熟知。最近，我读到他的著作《走出夹缝》，使我对他为何能取得巨大成功有了进一步的了解。
    他不是专业的经济理论工作者，但他用自己的实践经验写出了这本经济学著作。我们当然不能像对待专业经济理论工作者的著作那样要求他的著作的概念很准确、逻辑很严密、理论的概括很强，但他的著作总结了自己的经验，内容深刻、生动，有血有肉。所以也只有他能够写出这样的著作。
    在读了这本书后，我认为，在下述三个方面，本书写得颇有深度。
    　　　　第一，关于企业家的素质问题
    于志安是经过许多磨难终于取得巨大成功的企业家。由他来谈企业家的素质问题，可谓现身说法，自然更加深刻。在书中，有着许多相当精辟的论述，决非无实践经验者所能写出。同时他的有些论述又与国内外经济学家关于企业家精神的论述不乏共同之处。从他的论述来看，一个企业家必备的素质归纳起来，主要有以下几点。
    （１）具有开拓创新的进取精神。按照美国经济学家熊彼特的理论，企业家精神就是创新精神，没有开拓创新的进取精神就不能成为企业家，更不能成为优秀的企业家。在于志安的书中这种永不满足、不断创新的精神跃然纸上。他写道：“随着市场竞争的千变万化，企业应不断地推进科技进步，在新科技的基础上开发新产品，开拓经营，使企业对市场或社会需求的满足程度越来越大，越来越好。我总是告诫自己，要居安思危。现在产品畅销，但不能满足，我们仍要不断地开发更加畅销的产品、更有竞争力的产品，以便在更广阔的领域去追赶和占领不断发展变化的社会需求”（第１０２页）。
    （２）具有不畏压力、敢担风险的精神。在风云变幻的市场竞争中，企业家要取得胜利，必须不畏竞争的压力，敢担竞争的风险。于志安说：“能否在利益和风险并存的竞争中成为强者、胜者，首先取决于如何对待压力。真正的竞争者应不畏压力，不回避压力，因为压力常常是力量的源泉。”他甚至认为：如果压力不足，我主张引进压力。“引进压力是为了消化压力，增进压力，更好地竞争。”（第１９页）他自己就是这样做的。他主动切断向国家伸手要钱搞技术改造的路、兼并一些长期亏损的企业，就是为引进压力。他说得很对：“承担风险的能力应视为企业家的必备条件”，“不敢担风险，胆小怕事、唯唯诺诺的人，都不可能成为真正的企业家。”（第９６页）这是千真万确的。中外有成就的企业家无不具有敢作敢为、敢冒风险、敢担风险的大无畏精神。
    （３）善于捕捉机遇、善于决策。在面临巨大风险的情况下，如何化险为夷、克险制胜，关键在于捕捉机遇，善于决策。在书中，于志安对此有不少精采、独到的论述。举例来说，任何一个企业领导人，都会面临机遇，但不是所有的人都能认识机遇、利用机遇。有了机遇，就要及时捕捉住，不少机遇稍纵即逝。为此就要善于决策，谨慎而又果断地决策。他说：“当决策不决策，失掉发展企业的机会”，“成功便可能变成失败，而失去了时机，就可能再难捕捉到它。”（第１０９、１１１页）。那末，为什么有些企业领导人优柔寡断、放走了机遇呢？其中一个原因就是，正如于志安所说的：“机遇，在不少场合是伴随着困难出现的”，（第１０８页）因此，在机遇面前优柔寡断的背后，原来是在困难面前的软弱和胆怯。这样的企业领导人自然不可能成为真正的企业家。企业家之所以是企业家，正是具有向困难挑战的勇气，正是要通过正确的决策去克险取胜。同时，企业家还应善于把个人定夺与集体智谋很好地结合起来。
    （４）具有较高的经营管理的才能。熊彼特把企业家看作是生产要素新组合的组织者和推动者，使生产要素重新组合是企业家精神的内容之一。于志安的看法与此相合。他说：“一个企业家，最重要的素质，应该是具有这样的能力，即通过他的努力，使各种生产力要素，达到最优化的组合，然后最有效地进行生产活动”。（第９６页）这也就是企业家的经营管理才能的体现。
    （５）具有强烈的事业心和对社会的献身精神。这是当代优秀企业家具有的素质。对社会主义企业家来说，要大力提倡对事业的不懈追求、为国家和集体作贡献的献身精神，要为中国的振兴作出力所能及的业绩。他提出：“应该摆正奉献与索取的天平”（第１０７页）。如果一个厂长没有奉献精神，孜孜于个人名利的追逐，以权谋私，那末，“不仅足以毁掉自己，而且将毁掉一个企业”（第１０５页）。这些看法都是很中肯的，也是肺腑之言，足为企业领导者戒。
    　　　　第二，关于企业经营之道问题
    本书全部讲的都是经营之道。这里仅就于志安体会最深的地方着重地谈谈。
    （１）企业经营者必须时刻注视市场需求的变化，出奇制胜，勇于创新，努力开拓市场。用于志安的话来说：竞争中取胜之道在于“瞄准目标市场，朝人家尚未搞的特殊领域的方向去‘变’，而一跃成为新领域的佼佼者”（第８５页）。要“扬长避短，标新立异开发新产品。”（第２页）应该说这是长期生活在实物经济秩序下的中国企业领导人所缺乏的经营本领，但在商品经济秩序中又必须学会它、掌握它。于志安在书中多次用自身的经验对此作了生动而又具体的说明。
    （２）企业经营者必须注重效益，坚持走科技进步的道路，千方百计地实现“少投入，多产出”这一企业经营行为的总目标。我国企业的领导人已经习惯了在原有体制下的一套办法，即要增加生产就伸手向国家要投资。似乎企业不添新设备，不投资搞基建就没有后劲。因为这种办法比革新技术要容易。于志安把它称为应当破除的“迷信”。他坚持走一条依靠科技进步发展生产力的“捷径”，这就是“少投入、多产出”之路，它可以治疗“投资饥饿症”。他认为：传统的投资理论观念和习惯作法，已严重地妨碍了企业向内使劲，影响了企业挖潜、改造的积极性和经济效益的提高。他历数了传统做法的各种弊端。于志安在这方面的经验和独到见解对我国的企业具有普遍的现实意义。
    （３）企业经营者必须善于协调和驾驭企业内部复杂的人际关系，挖掘人的全部潜能，这是许多企业没有解决好的难题。于志安提出要发挥“人的集聚效应”，要把人“盘活”。他说，厂长、经理不仅要具有善于开拓经营的头脑和气魄，还须具备善于启迪和调动职工智能的良好素质，把人“盘活”，才能给企业带来无穷的活力。在这方面，他确实有一套好的主张和办法，例如，在他的眼中“没有‘废人’”；要“用人所长”；“在管的基础上严”，使职工“真正感到自己与工厂息息相关，命运相连”；（第７６页）要依靠知识分子和工人这两只翅膀，使企业腾飞。一个好的企业领导者必须首先正己，才能带出一支过得硬的职工队伍，以正治邪，则正气盛、厂风正、人心齐、力量大；等等。我觉得，在他的这些经验中包含有可以构成适合我国传统的“企业文化”和企业管理办法的内容，值得我们思考和研究。
    （４）企业经营者必须善于在国家政策范围内制定适合企业实际状况的企业发展的总体战略和措施。这是企业能否取得成功的最重要条件之一。一个真正有作为的企业家，不仅要有经营企业的才能，而且要在经营管理中注入强烈的“政策”意识，做到在正确理解和执行国家与区域政策的同时，善于制定一些带政策性的措施与办法，在这方面于志安有很多见解和经验并在实践中运用，使他经营的企业取得了可观的成效。
    　　　　第三，关于企业的外部环境问题
    即使企业领导人具有能够成为企业家的许多素质，并懂得企业经营之道，如果没有一个合适的外部环境，他也很难成为真正的企业家，把企业经营好。这就是我们在传统的实物经济体制下存在的情况。于志安说得对，“在没有实行商品经济、没有竞争或者不允许竞争的社会历史条件下，确实不具备办好企业的基本条件，自然也很难成长出真正的企业家来。这就是说，企业家的生存和发展是需要客观环境的”。（第９７页）于志安在企业中干了几十年，深知要造就必要的外部环境就必须改革经济体制。他从多年的切身经历中提出的关于改革的一些见解自然是颇为中肯的。我想着重指出以下几点：
    （１）发展商品经济。他认为这是造成客观环境中根本的方面。因为不发展商品经济，市场和竞争就不复存在；而没有市场和竞争，也就没有优胜劣汰，企业和企业家就没有外部压力，没有活动的舞台，也就谈不上施行与商品经济相适应的经营之道。
    （２）建立平等竞争的环境。也就是让企业处在同一条起跑线上开展竞争。对此，于志安认为：我国传统的划分企业等级的严重弊端必须革除，某些企业由于隶属关系和先天条件优越而享有的特殊待遇应予取消，不允许任何单位和个人凭借其职权，违背政策和法律来干扰竞争，更不允许官僚垄断来反对竞争。当然除此以外还必须改革价格体系等体制问题。
    （３）政企分离，使企业享有充分的自主权。这是为了使企业摆脱来自行政部门的各种干预，能够自主经营。于志安说，要“淡化”隶属关系，直到让企业在没有“婆婆”、没有主管、没有干预，而只受方针、政策、法律约束的条件下自主地开展经营活动，自主地参与商品经济的竞争。他认为，政府“管理企业只要有一个法宝就可以了，那就是唐僧的‘紧箍咒’”，所谓“紧箍咒”就是“以法规制约代替行政指挥”（第３１页）。为此就要制定有利于形成良好外部环境、有利于企业自主经营的各种法规。
    于志安把他的这些想法运用于对长江动力公司内部的管理，确立了“无治而为”的原则，并取得了成功。当然，就整个社会来说，情况要比一个公司内部各企业之间、公司与企业之间的关系复杂得多。但有些道理还是相通的。
    总之，于志安同志的《走出夹缝》是一本有意义、有价值的书，不仅从事实际经济工作的人（特别是企业领导人）值得读，从事经济理论工作的人也值得一读。
