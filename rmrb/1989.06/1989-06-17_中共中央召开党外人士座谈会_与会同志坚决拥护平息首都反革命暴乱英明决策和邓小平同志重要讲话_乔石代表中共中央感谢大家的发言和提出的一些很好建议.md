The Communist Party of China Central Committee held a symposium with non-party personnel this afternoon in the Zhongnanhai Huairen Hall, inviting leaders from the central committees of various democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and non-partisan individuals to discuss Deng Xiaoping's speech during his reception of senior military officers of the Beijing martial law troops and the joint letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council to all Communist Party members and the people of the entire nation. The symposium also listened to the opinions and suggestions of non-party comrades on current work.

The meeting was presided over by Qiao Shi, a member of the Political Bureau Standing Committee of the CPC Central Committee.

Chairman Zhu Xuefan of the Central Committee of the China National Democratic Construction Association, Chairman Fei Xiaotong of the Central Committee of the China Democratic League, Chairman Sun Qimeng of the Central Committee of the China Democratic National Construction Association, non-partisan individual Cheng Siyuan, Chairman Lei Jieqiong of the Central Committee of the China Democratic Promotion Association, Vice Chairman Fang Rongxin of the Central Committee of the Chinese Peasants and Workers Democratic Party, Vice Chairman Yang Jike of the Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party, Vice Chairman Sun Chengpei of the Central Committee of the Jiusan Society, Chairman Cai Zimin of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, and Vice Chairman Sun Naoling of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce spoke at the meeting.

During the symposium, the central committees of various democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and non-partisan individuals unanimously expressed their firm support for the CPC Central Committee's wise decision to quell the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital and Deng Xiaoping's important speech. They believed that Xiaoping's speech was far-sighted and eloquently explained the nature and root causes of this counter-revolutionary riot, deeply summarized the past, looked ahead to the future, and pointed out the direction for China's reform and construction. It is a programmatic document. The attendees expressed their highest respect to the People's Liberation Army martial law troops, the armed police, and public security personnel who made great contributions to quelling the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital, expressed deep condolences to the martyrs who died, and expressed heartfelt thanks to the broad cadres and workers who persisted in their work and production under extremely difficult conditions.

The attendees studied Xiaoping's important speech and deeply understood that a small number of people planned this counter-revolutionary riot to overthrow the Communist Party of China, overthrow the socialist system, and overthrow the People's Republic of China to establish a completely Western-style bourgeois republic. Everyone unanimously agreed that without the Communist Party, there would be no New China, and without adhering to the socialist path, China would have no way out. Various democratic parties and the Federation of Industry and Commerce have always adhered to relying on the leadership of the Communist Party and devoted themselves to the socialist cause. In this serious political struggle, they will, as always, stand together with the Communist Party of China, weather the storm, share weal and woe, continue to adhere to the four cardinal principles, and resolutely fight against any plot to deny the leadership of the Communist Party, deny the socialist system, and overthrow the People's Republic. They will play an active role in the construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics.

The attendees expressed that at this critical moment concerning the future and destiny of the country and the nation, various democratic parties and the Federation of Industry and Commerce should assist the Communist Party of China and the government in thoroughly quelling the counter-revolutionary riot and maintaining a stable and united political situation. Various democratic parties require all members to seriously study the joint letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council to all Communist Party members and the people of the entire nation, study Deng Xiaoping's important speech, distinguish right from wrong, unify their understanding, guard their posts, do their jobs well, and explain to the masses and overseas communities they are connected with, clarify the facts, and contribute to stabilizing the situation and making up for the losses caused by the riot with practical actions.

At the symposium, the attendees sincerely proposed suggestions to the work of the Communist Party of China and the government. They unanimously believed that in the struggle to quell the counter-revolutionary riot in the capital, it is necessary to adhere to facts as the basis and the Constitution and laws as the criterion, pay attention to strictly distinguishing between two types of different contradictions, and severely punish a small number of rioters and their behind-the-scenes planners. For the vast majority of the masses who do not understand the truth and students who have some extreme words and deeds, it is necessary to do in-depth and detailed ideological and political work to help them raise their awareness. Everyone believes that the problems of "official profiteering" and corruption, which are of common concern to the government and the people, will definitely be effectively solved on the track of democracy and the rule of law.

The attendees expressed their firm support for Deng Xiaoping's reiteration of the thought of "one center and two basic points" summarized by the 13th National Congress of the Communist Party of China. Xiaoping's speech clearly pointed out that our basic propositions, from the development strategy to policies, including reform and opening up, are correct, and we must carry them out unswervingly. Everyone expressed their determination to carry out this spirit, continue to adhere to various united front policies and policies for intellectuals, and continuously consolidate and develop the broadest patriotic united front. The democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and non-partisan individuals are determined to unite more closely around the Communist Party of China, adhere to the four cardinal principles, adhere to reform and opening up, strengthen spiritual civilization construction, and continue to promote socialist democratic politics and socialist legal system construction. They will improve and develop the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party, mobilize all positive factors, boost spirits, enhance confidence, and strive for the revitalization of China, the reunification of the motherland, and the greater victory of China's socialist modernization construction.

Qiao Shi, on behalf of the CPC Central Committee, thanked the attendees for their speeches and the good suggestions they made in their speeches. He said that such a symposium fully reflects the superiority of the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, fully reflects the spirit of sharing weal and woe and sharing honor and disgrace between various democratic parties and the Communist Party of China.

Qiao Shi said that due to the turmoil in Beijing from the student movement to the disturbance and then to the counter-revolutionary riot, the time was relatively long and also quite complex. Therefore, people having various thoughts and doubts is very natural. These can be solved through a further understanding of the facts and studying Xiaoping's speech to achieve a unified understanding.

Qiao Shi said that now, from Beijing to the whole country, the overall situation is tending to stabilize. Xiaoping's speech has played an important role in stabilizing people's minds and the whole country. He hoped that various democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and non-partisan individuals would do more work to further stabilize the situation.

Qiao Shi said that in the future, we should work together to further strengthen the construction of socialist democracy and the legal system, including improving and developing the people's congress system, the system of multi-party cooperation under the leadership of the Communist Party, and the system of political consultation; continue to solve the problems that the people care about in a practical and solid manner; continue to carry out multi-level and multi-channel consultations and dialogues with various sectors of society to improve the work of the Party and the government, and make the modernization construction of socialism with Chinese characteristics even better.

Those who attended the symposium today also included: Yan Mingfu, a member of the Secretariat of the CPC Central Committee, Vice Chairman Xi Zhongxun of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress, and Vice Chairman Wang Renzhong of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference; major responsible persons from the central committees of various democratic parties, the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce, and representatives of non-partisan individuals Qu Wu, Zheng Dongguo, Hou Jingru, Peng Qingyuan, Li Ganliu, Gao Tian, Ye Duyi, Tao Dayong, Feng Zhixun, Sun Xiaocun, Wan Guoqian, Feng Tiyun, Huang Danni, Bai Dahua, Chen Shunli, Ge Zhicheng, Chu Zhuang, Zhang Shiming, Tian Guangtao, Huang Dingchen, Lu Rongshu, Yan Jizi, Xu Caideng, He Yipu, Chen Mingshao, Wu Kete, Chen Zhongyi, Rong Yiren, Huang Liangchen, Gu Gengyu; and relevant department heads Cao Zhi, Song Deshen, Li Ding, Wan Shaofen, Wu Lianyuan, Song Kun, Zhang Shengzuo, etc.

    新华社北京６月１７日电  中共中央今天下午在中南海怀仁堂召开党外人士座谈会，邀请各民主党派中央、全国工商联领导同志和无党派人士，讨论邓小平同志在接见首都戒严部队军以上干部时的讲话和中共中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》，同时听取了党外同志对当前工作的意见和建议。
    会议由中共中央政治局常委乔石主持。
    民革中央主席朱学范、民盟中央主席费孝通、民建中央主席孙起孟、无党派人士程思远、民进中央主席雷洁琼、农工党中央副主席方荣欣、致公党中央副主席杨纪珂、九三学社中央副主席孙承佩、台盟中央主席团主席蔡子民、全国工商联副主席孙孚凌，先后在会上发了言。
    座谈中，各民主党派中央、全国工商联、无党派人士一致表示，坚决拥护中共中央平息首都反革命暴乱的英明决策和邓小平同志的重要讲话。大家认为，小平同志的讲话高瞻远瞩，精辟地阐述了这场反革命暴乱的性质、根源，深刻地总结了过去，展望了未来，指明了我国改革和建设的方向，是一个纲领性的文件。到会同志向在平息首都反革命暴乱中作出巨大贡献的人民解放军戒严部队、武警指战员和公安干警表示崇高的敬意，向死难烈士表示深切的哀悼，向在十分困难的条件下坚持工作和生产的广大干部和职工表示由衷的感谢。
    与会同志学习了小平同志的重要讲话，深刻认识到极少数人策划这场反革命暴乱的目的是要打倒中国共产党，推翻社会主义制度，颠覆中华人民共和国，建立一个完全西方式的资产阶级共和国。大家一致认为，没有共产党，就没有新中国，不坚持社会主义道路，中国就没有出路。各民主党派、工商联一贯坚持依靠共产党的领导，致力于社会主义事业，在当前这场严肃的政治斗争中，将一如既往地同中国共产党站在一起，风雨同舟，患难与共，继续坚持四项基本原则，旗帜鲜明地同任何否定共产党的领导、否定社会主义制度、颠覆人民共和国的阴谋活动进行坚决的斗争，在建设有中国特色的社会主义事业中发挥积极作用。
    与会同志表示，在关系到国家和民族前途命运的关键时刻，各民主党派、工商联要协助中国共产党和政府，为彻底平息反革命暴乱，为维护安定团结的政治局面而努力。各民主党派要求全体成员认真学习中共中央、国务院《告全体共产党员和全国人民书》，学习邓小平同志的重要讲话，明辨是非，统一认识，坚守岗位，做好本职工作，并向所联系的群众和海外各界人士多做解释，阐明事实真相，以实际行动为稳定大局和挽回因暴乱造成的损失作出贡献。
    座谈会上，与会人士还诚恳地向中国共产党和政府的工作提出了建议。他们一致认为，在平息首都这场反革命暴乱的斗争中，要坚持以事实为根据，以宪法、法律为准绳，注意严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，对极少数暴乱分子及其幕后策划者，要严惩不贷；对广大不明真相的群众和有一些过激言行的学生，要多做深入细致的思想政治工作，帮助他们提高觉悟。大家相信，政府和人民一致重视的整治“官倒”、清除腐败等问题，一定能够在民主和法制的轨道上得到切实有效的解决。
    到会同志对邓小平同志再次强调中国共产党十三大概括的“一个中心、两个基本点”的思想深表拥护。小平同志讲话中明确指出，我们的一些基本提法，从发展战略到方针政策，包括改革开放，都是对的，要坚定不移地干下去。大家表示要坚决贯彻这一精神，继续坚持各项统战政策和知识分子政策，不断巩固和发展最广泛的爱国统一战线。民主党派、全国工商联和无党派人士，决心更紧密地团结在中国共产党周围，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，加强精神文明建设，继续推进社会主义民主政治和社会主义法制建设，完善发展中国共产党领导的多党合作制度，调动一切积极因素，振奋精神，增强信心，为振兴中华、统一祖国，为夺取我国的社会主义现代化建设事业的更大胜利而奋斗。
    乔石代表中共中央对与会同志的发言和他们在发言中提出的一些很好的建议表示感谢。他说，这样的座谈会充分体现了中国共产党领导的多党合作制度的优越性，充分体现了各民主党派与中国共产党同舟共济和肝胆相照、荣辱与共的精神。
    乔石说，由于北京从学潮发展到动乱、以至反革命暴乱，时间较长，也比较复杂，因此人们有这样那样的想法、疑问，是很自然的，可以通过对事实的进一步了解，通过对小平同志讲话的学习加以解决，取得一致的认识。
    乔石说，现在，从北京到全国，总的形势趋于稳定。小平同志的讲话对稳定人心，稳定全国，起到了重要的作用。希望各民主党派、全国工商联和无党派人士为进一步稳定局势多做工作。
    乔石说，今后，我们要共同努力，进一步加强社会主义民主与法制建设，其中包括完善、发展人民代表大会制度、共产党领导的多党合作制度和政治协商制度；继续扎扎实实地解决好人民群众普遍关心的问题；继续开展同社会各界多层次、多渠道的协商对话，以改进党和政府的工作，把有中国特色的社会主义现代化建设搞得更好。
    出席今天座谈会的还有：中共中央书记处书记阎明复、全国人大常委会副委员长习仲勋、全国政协副主席王任重；各民主党派中央、全国工商联主要负责人，无党派人士代表屈武、郑洞国、侯镜如、彭清源、李赣骝、高天、叶笃义、陶大镛、冯之浚、孙晓村、万国权、冯梯云、黄大能、白大华、陈舜礼、葛志成、楚庄、章师明、田光涛、黄鼎臣、陆榕树、严济慈、徐采栋、郝诒纯、陈明绍、吴克泰、陈仲颐、荣毅仁、黄凉尘、古耕虞；有关部门负责人曹志、宋德敏、李定、万绍芬、武连元、宋堃、张声作等。
