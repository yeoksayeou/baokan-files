The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said today that the U.S. Embassy in China sheltering the two fugitives Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian is an interference in China's internal affairs and a violation of China's sovereignty. China is closely monitoring the developments of the situation.

Li Jinhua said at a news conference this afternoon, "This action not only violates China's relevant laws but also violates internationally recognized international law and the principles of the Sino-American Joint Communiqué."

She said, "Fang Lizhi and his wife have violated China's laws and should be punished according to the law. The Chinese public security authorities have issued a warrant for their arrest."

Li Jinhua made these remarks in response to a question from an American journalist about the changes in Sino-American relations over the past two weeks.

　　外交部发言人说    
    美国驻华使馆庇护方励之夫妇是干涉中国内政侵犯中国主权
    新华社北京６月２９日电  外交部发言人今天在这里说，美国驻华使馆庇护方励之、李淑娴两名逃犯是对中国内政的干涉、对中国主权的侵犯，中国正密切注意事态的发展。
    李金华在下午举行的新闻发布会上说：“这既违反中国有关法律，又违反公认的国际法，更违反中美联合公报的原则”。
    她说，方励之夫妇触犯了中国的法律，应依法受到惩处，中国公安机关已发出通缉令。
    李金华是在一位美国记者问及最近两周中美关系有何变化时说这番话的。
