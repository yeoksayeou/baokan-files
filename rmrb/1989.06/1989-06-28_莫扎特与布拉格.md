	Mozart and Prague
	Sun Xiyou

	Those who love music are generally aware that Mozart was a musical giant of Austria. However, the people of Prague also hold a special affection for him, affectionately referring to Mozart as their own musician. In the bustling Wenceslas Square in Prague, some shop windows display the words "Prague discovered Mozart's genius." When the American film "Mozart" was screened in Prague cinemas, the entire city was abuzz, with lines of people stretching hundreds of meters to buy tickets. The film was shown continuously for half a year, with unabated enthusiasm.

	Mozart has a special connection with Prague. In the summer of 1786, Prague staged Mozart's famous opera "The Marriage of Figaro," with every performance packed to the brim. Historical records note, "The highly musically educated Czech audience, especially the Prague audience, appreciated Mozart's genius more than the Viennese audience." Inspired by the enthusiasm of the audience, Mozart visited Prague for the first time that year, witnessing this touching scene, and decided to write an opera for the people of Prague.

	For this purpose, Mozart returned to Prague in October 1787, staying in the villa of his close friend, the then most famous classical musician in Czechoslovakia, Dussek, located on a hill outside Prague (see the accompanying image). Dussek highly appreciated Mozart's light operas, and Mozart also admired Dussek's musical talent and artistic achievements, regarding him as an elder brother.

	That year, the autumn in Prague was particularly beautiful. Dussek's villa garden was filled with poetic charm. Mozart often walked along the quiet paths on the hill, stepping on the golden autumn leaves. As the sun set, the rosy hues of the evening sky cast a shimmering glow over the Vltava River below, creating a spectrum of colors. A surge of creative inspiration flashed through Mozart's mind. Thus, his masterpiece "Don Giovanni" was quickly born. "Don Giovanni," also known as "The Punishment of the Libertine," exposes the decadent and corrupt lifestyle of the nobility. On October 29, Mozart dedicated this work to the audience of Prague. He personally conducted the performance of the opera "Don Giovanni" in the resplendent National Theater, achieving great success.

	To commemorate Mozart, Dussek's villa has been converted into the Mozart Museum, housing Mozart's used instruments, musical manuscripts, and personal belongings. The museum holds Mozart's works concerts every Friday evening in the courtyard.

	The people of Prague will never forget that Mozart also composed the "G Minor Fantasy" in Prague. It was one day in November 1787 when Mozart visited the ancient Smichov Czech National Literary Institute. The institute's introduction still proudly mentions Mozart's visit as a glorious page in its history. After the visit, Mozart went to the adjacent church, where there was a finely crafted organ. He asked if he could play a piece, and the authorities readily agreed. Mozart enthusiastically walked to the organ and played a piece impromptu. The melodious sound of the organ captivated everyone present. The church organist was a diligent person who made every effort to record Mozart's impromptu performance, thus giving birth to the "G Minor Fantasy."

	On one day in November 1987, the music community of Prague gathered in the Smichov Church, using the organ that Mozart had played on to perform this famous piece once again, recreating the moving scene of the genius composer's performance 200 years ago.

　　莫扎特与布拉格
    孙希有
    爱好音乐的人大都晓得莫扎特是奥地利一代音乐泰斗。然而布拉格人对他也怀有特殊的感情，亲切地称莫扎特为自己的音乐家。在布拉格最繁华的瓦茨拉夫大街商店的一些橱窗上贴着“布拉格人发现了莫扎特天才”的字幅。在布拉格影院放映美国摄制的影片《莫扎特》时，全城轰动，排队购票的长龙达数百米，影片连续上演半年，盛况不衰。
    莫扎特与布拉格有着特殊的缘份。１７８６年夏，布拉格上演了莫扎特著名歌剧《费加罗的婚礼》，场场爆满。史书上曾这样记载，“有高度音乐修养的捷克听众，尤其是布拉格听众，比维也纳的听众更能欣赏莫扎特的天才。”在观众热情感染下，莫扎特在这一年里首次来到布拉格，目睹这感人的场面，决定为布拉格人写一部歌剧。
    为此，莫扎特于１７８７年１０月再次来到布拉格，住在自己的挚友、捷当时最著名的古典音乐家杜谢克在布拉格郊外山上的别墅（见题图）。杜谢克十分欣赏莫扎特的轻歌剧，莫扎特也敬佩杜谢克的音乐天才和艺术造诣，视其为兄长。
    这一年，布拉格的秋天特别美丽。杜谢克别墅的花园充满诗情画意。莫扎特经常踏着金秋的落叶，漫步于山上幽静的小道。夕阳西下，玫瑰色的晚霞洒在山下伏尔塔瓦河上，泛起碧波，激起五彩缤纷的虹光。一阵阵创作灵感闪现于莫扎特的脑海。于是，他的另一部巨作《唐璜》便很快问世。《唐璜》又名《浪子受罚》，这部歌剧揭露了贵族的荒淫腐朽的生活。１０月２９日，莫扎特把这部作品献给了布拉格的观众。他在金碧辉煌的迪尔剧院亲自指挥歌剧《唐璜》的演出，获得极大成功。
    为纪念莫扎特，杜谢克别墅已被辟为莫扎特博物馆，珍藏着莫扎特用过的乐器、音乐作品手稿和生活用品。博物馆每星期五晚上都在院子里举办莫扎特作品音乐会。
    布拉格人永远不会忘记，莫扎特还在布拉格创作了《Ｇ小调幻想曲》。那是１７８７年１１月的一天，莫扎特来到古老的斯米霍夫捷克国家文学馆参观。这家文学馆的解说词中至今还把莫扎特的来访作为自己历史上的光荣一页。莫扎特参观完后，来到紧靠文学馆的教堂，里面有一架精制的管风琴，他问能否弹奏一曲，院方欣然允诺。莫扎特兴致勃勃地走到琴前，即兴演奏一曲。悠扬悦耳的琴声使在场的人陶醉。教堂的琴师是位有心人，他尽最大的努力将莫扎特即兴演奏的曲子记录下来，《Ｇ小调幻想曲》就这样诞生了。
    １９８７年１１月的一天，布拉格音乐界人士聚集在斯米霍夫教堂，用莫扎特当年使用过的管风琴再次演奏了这一名曲，重现了２００年前这位天才作曲家演奏时的动人情景。
