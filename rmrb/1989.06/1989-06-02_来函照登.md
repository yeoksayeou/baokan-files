The People's Daily published an article titled "Ignorance Challenges Science" on May 20th, 20th edition, 5th page, which mentioned that Xueyuan Publishing House also publishes books on "astrology." Upon investigation, our publishing house has never published such books. In March of this year, we discovered a book titled "Palmistry and Destiny" that illegally used the name "Xueyuan Publishing House" on its cover. The ISBN numbers belong to other publishers, making it an illegal publication unrelated to our publishing house.

    人民日报５月２０日第五版刊登的《愚昧在向科学挑战》一文中，提到学苑出版社也出版了“星相”一类书籍。经查，我社从未出版过这类书。今年３月我们发现有一种叫《手相与命运》的书，封面盗用“学苑出版社”名义，书号都是别的出版社的，属于非法出版物，与我社无关。　　　　　　　　学苑出版社
