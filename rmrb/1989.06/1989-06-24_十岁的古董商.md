The business of buying and selling antiques requires a keen eye and experience. Most people in this field are quite old, at least adults, so they can distinguish and appreciate old antiques. However, in Britain, a young prodigy has emerged in the antique world. He is only ten years old and has already opened an antique shop to conduct antique business. He is also planning to write a book to guide people on how to search for and purchase valuable antiques. This unique antique dealer with a keen eye is named James Harris. His antique sources are all from flea markets, bought with a few pennies of pocket money. Due to his professional eye for antiques, even British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has written him a letter, praising him for his young age but great ambition to become the boss of an antique shop.

James's antique shop operates in Cardiff, Britain. This young boy said that he started collecting antiques at the age of four. From then on, his bedroom was filled with various antiques and books about antiques. James explained that his interest in collecting antiques is related to his mother. He said, "From a young age, my mother liked to take me to flea markets to buy things. Gradually, I felt that if I didn't pick out a couple of things I liked while waiting for my mother to shop, it would be a waste of time."

Since then, this four-year-old boy started collecting antique toys and antique statues at flea markets. These items were later found to be mostly valuable and could be sold at high prices. A gold-colored relief seashell that James bought for very little money is now worth six hundred pounds. In addition to buying antique toys, James is also interested in old tableware. Among the large collection of tableware he has, there are many silverware worth one hundred pounds, and a silver spoon made in the eighteenth century can now be sold for over one thousand pounds at an auction.

His mother, Mrs. Harris, is also amazed by his unique talent. She has three sons, and the other two are like ordinary boys who like to play soccer and read comic books. Only James is special. This mother said, "Since James was four and a half years old, he can earn at least one hundred and fifty pounds every week. I used to take the children to the flea market because we didn't have money to buy good clothes for the children, so we had to buy used clothes. Now I still go to the flea market to buy used clothes for the children."

　　十岁的古董商
    古董买卖，是一门讲究眼光和经验的行业。从事这一行业的，大多数年纪都很大，至少也应该是成年，这样才能分辨和欣赏老古董。然而，英国却出现了一位古董界的幼年奇才，他现年只有十岁，已开设了一间古董店来经营古董买卖，他还准备写一本书，指导人们如何搜购价值不低的古董。这名眼光独特的古董业奇才，名叫詹姆士·哈利斯，他的古董货源，全是在杂货摊里以一分一厘微薄的零用钱买回来的。由于他对古董具备专业眼光，连英国首相撒切尔夫人也曾给他写过一封信，称赞他年纪虽小，却有志气做起了古董店的老板。
    詹姆士开设的古董店，在英国卡迪夫营业。这位小孩说，他从四岁起就开始收购古董，从那时起，在他的卧室里，就放满了各类古董，以及有关古董的书籍。詹姆士解释这种搜购兴趣，其实和他的母亲有关。他说：“从小母亲就喜欢带我到杂货摊买东西，渐渐地我觉得在杂货摊里等妈妈买东西的时候，不选一两件自己喜欢的东西，那就等于在浪费时间。”
    从此，这位当年只有四岁的小朋友，就在杂货摊里搜购那些古董小玩具和古董神像。这些东西后来经证实，大部分是可以高价出售的。詹姆士花了很少钱买回的一个金色浮雕贝壳，现在就价值六百英镑。除了买古董小玩具外，詹姆士对那些旧餐具也很感兴趣。他所收藏的一大堆餐具中，就不乏那些价值一百英镑的银器，而一只十八世纪制造的银匙，现在在拍卖行出售大概可以超过一千英镑。
    其母哈利斯夫人对他这种奇妙的天份也感到很惊奇。她一共有三个儿子，另两个儿子都像一般男孩一样，喜欢踢足球和看连环画书，只有詹姆士最特别。这位母亲说：“自从詹姆士四岁半的时候起，他每星期至少可以收入一百五十英镑。我以前带孩子去杂货摊，是因为家里没有钱给孩子买好衣服穿，只好到杂货摊买旧衣服。现在我仍去杂货摊买旧衣服给孩子穿。”
