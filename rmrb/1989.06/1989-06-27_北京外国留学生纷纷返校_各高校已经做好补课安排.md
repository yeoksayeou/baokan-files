	Foreign students in Beijing have been returning to their campuses in large numbers. At institutions such as the Beijing Language Institute, Tsinghua University, Beijing Medical University, Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications, and Beijing University of Technology, over 500 students from more than 60 countries are currently preparing for exams.

	Following the counter-revolutionary riot that occurred in Beijing on June 3, some countries' embassies in China sent their students back home, and a number of students traveled to other regions. Since Beijing has restored order, many students have returned to their campuses to resume their studies. Some students who have already returned home have recently contacted their schools by phone or letter, expressing their desire to return to continue their education. Beijing's universities welcome their return and have made arrangements for make-up classes.

    新华社北京６月２７日电（记者张慧贤）大批在北京学习的外国留学生最近纷纷返校学习。在北京语言学院、清华大学、北京医科大学、北京邮电学院、北京科技大学等学校，目前已有６０多个国家的５００多名留学生正在准备考试。
    ６月３日北京发生反革命暴乱后，一些国家驻华使馆把本国留学生接送回国，还有一批留学生到外地旅游。北京恢复正常秩序之后，许多留学生纷纷返校学习。一些已回国的留学生近日给学校打电话或写信，要求返校继续学习。北京各高等院校欢迎他们返校，并作好了为他们补课的安排。
