In the western part of Lake City, Zhejiang, there stands a temple surrounded by red walls known as the Iron Buddha Temple.

The temple was originally built during the Tang Dynasty's Kaiyuan era (713–741), initially named Guangfu Guanyin Temple, housing a clay statue of Guanyin. Legend has it that in the third year of the Tianbao era (744), Master Jianzhen failed in his three attempts to sail east to Japan. He traveled from Aoyue Temple in Mingzhou (Ningbo) through Yuezhou (Shaoxing) and Yuhang to Lake City to lecture and confer precepts. At that time, there was an attempt to cast an iron Guanyin statue, but it was not completed. It was not until the third year of the Song Dynasty's Tianxi era (1025) that the wish of Master Jianzhen was fulfilled, and an iron Guanyin statue was cast, establishing the Iron Guanyin Temple. By the end of the Yuan Dynasty, the temple was destroyed in the war, leaving only the iron Guanyin statue. In the second year of the Hongwu era (1369), the temple was moved to its current location and renamed the Iron Buddha Zen Temple. In the eighth year of the Xuande era (1433), the monk Tanbi cast three large iron Buddhas: Sakyamuni, Manjusri, and Samantabhadra, establishing the Ciyun Hall. From then on, the Iron Buddha Temple became famous far and wide, with thriving incense offerings.

During an unprecedented catastrophe, the three large iron Buddhas in the temple were destroyed. Shortly after, two grand halls were occupied by a factory. The temple's scriptures and other valuables were burned, leaving only the iron Guanyin statue without its hands.

In 1978, the provincial and municipal governments allocated funds for the original Jiaxing Prefecture Cultural Relics Management Committee to undertake repairs. Through the meticulous efforts of skilled craftsmen, the iron Guanyin's hands were restored to their original state, akin to a successful "hand reattachment" surgery!

Today, the iron Guanyin statue in the Iron Buddha Temple stands at 2.15 meters tall and weighs approximately 1.5 tons. Its body is a deep black color with a lustrous sheen. The Buddha stands to the right, facing sideways on a turtle's back, with a dignified and benevolent expression. Its posture is elegant and graceful, adorned with a high-crowned headdress, and its robes flow smoothly. It embodies the rich heritage of the Tang Dynasty and heralds the elegant style of the Song Dynasty, truly a rare and precious large-scale art treasure. During holidays and festivals, visitors flock to the temple.

　　铁佛寺
    金弧
    在浙江湖州城西，有一座赭墙四围的铁佛寺。
    寺始建于唐开元年间（７１３—７４１年），初名广福观音院，奉观音泥塑像。相传唐天宝三年（７４４年），鉴真大师三次东渡扶桑不克，曾从明州（宁波）阿育王寺经越州（绍兴）、余杭到湖州讲经授戒。当时，欲铸造一尊铁观音未成。及至宋天圣三年（１０２５年），始承鉴真宿愿，铸就铁观音，建铁观音院。元末，寺毁于兵乱，仅存铁观音。明洪武二年（１３６９年）移寺于今址，改名铁佛禅寺。明宣德八年（１４３３年），僧昙璧又铸大铁佛释迦牟尼、文殊、普贤三尊，创慈云阁。从此，铁佛寺遐迩闻名，香火鼎盛。
    在史无前例的浩劫中，寺内三尊大铁佛被毁。未几，两幢大殿被占为工厂。寺内法卷、壮严等均遭焚坏，幸存的只有失去双手的铁观音。
    １９７８年，省、地政府拨款由原加兴专署文物管理委员会进行整修。经能工巧匠精心“会诊”，铁观音双手得复原状，无异于人的“断手再植”！
    今天的铁佛寺中铁观音像，高２．１５米，重约１．５吨。体呈黝黑色，颇具光泽。佛身右向侧立鳌背，法相庄严仁慈，体态端丽飘逸，冠饰高雅，衣缝流畅，上承盛唐丰腴遗风，下开宋代俊丽先声，确实是一尊罕见的大型艺术珍品。逢节假日，游人接踵。
