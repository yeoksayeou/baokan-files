A Sichuan opera, "Pan Jinlian," has sparked a flurry of praise and criticism in the theatrical world, while a few essays have stirred up a storm in the literary circles.

People are asking: Who is Wei Minglun?

This gentleman is a scriptwriter for the Sichuan Opera Troupe of Zigong City, Sichuan. He is 47 years old. Like many people who grew up with the white salt of Zigong, Wei Minglun has a greenish-yellow complexion and is not particularly handsome. He is nearly two heads shorter than his friend Feng Jicai. Wei Minglun's education is not impressive; by today's standards, he only completed elementary school. His subsequent experiences involve treading the stage and rolling through rural factories. The ups and downs of the stage, the twists and turns of life, combined with the unique talent of a Sichuan scholar and his diligence, have led Wei Minglun to achieve success in literature. His works are extraordinary. The scripts "Yi Dan Da," "Four Sisters," and "Ba Shan Scholar" won the National Excellent Script Award for three consecutive years. Following that, the unconventional Sichuan opera "Pan Jinlian" brought new life to the somewhat lackluster opera stage. Looking at his essays, they are all excellent pieces, sometimes stirring, sometimes hilarious. His elegant four-character phrases astonish those from formal schools, and when seasoned with the spicy sarcasm of Sichuan dialect, opponents find it difficult to refute him.

To understand Sichuan dialect, listening to Wei Minglun chat is a great pleasure. Whether discussing politics or theater, he has unique insights, and his eloquence is exceptional. He speaks incredibly fast, often inserting Sichuan opera arias appropriately. When excited, he stands up, performs a series of stage steps, and demonstrates various gestures. Singing, speaking, acting, and fighting are all included, embodying the roles of sheng, dan, jing, and chou. The audience cannot help but share in his anger and joy.

That year, "Pan Jinlian" came to Beijing, performed three shows, and hurriedly left, leaving those who did not get to see it envious for three years. This early summer, Wei Minglun will bring "Pan Jinlian" back to Beijing. Even more exciting is that the Sichuan Opera Troupe of Zigong will also bring Wei Minglun's new play "Xi Zhao Qishan," another unconventional play that reflects on Zhuge Liang's later years. According to Wei Minglun, "This play is against the mythical Zhuge Liang, denying the human god created by generations of Chinese people, and turning Kongming into a human." This play is sure to stir up some waves on the capital's stage. Let's see.

### 魏明伦来京何为

　　魏明伦来京何为
    袁晞
    一出川剧《潘金莲》引得剧界毁誉纷纷，几篇杂文惹得文坛沸沸扬扬。
    人们惊问：谁是魏明伦？
    这位先生是四川自贡市川剧团的编剧，现年４７岁。魏明伦跟许多守着自贡白盐长大的人一样肤色青黄，其貌不扬，比他的朋友冯骥才矮了近两个头。魏明伦学历也不佳，按时下正规标准，他只能填小学肄业。之后的经历就是在戏台上蹬踏，农村工厂滚打。舞台的风风雨雨，生活的坎坎坷坷，加上蜀中秀才别具的才气和他的孜孜不倦，魏明伦成就了文学事业。他出手不凡，剧本《易胆大》、《四姑娘》和《巴山秀才》连续三年获全国优秀剧本奖，接着是反传统的川剧《潘金莲》，给不那么景气的戏曲舞台带来生机。再看他的杂文，喜笑怒骂皆成文章，时让人激动，时让人捧腹，那漂漂亮亮的四六句让科班出身的咋舌，再佐以四川话中讥诮挖苦的辣味调料，反对者想下笔驳他也颇费踌躇。
    要懂四川话，听魏明伦聊天也是一大乐事。不论是议政还是谈戏都有独见，口才更不一般，说起来奇快无比，不时恰如其分地插入川剧的唱段。说高兴了，起身一串台步，几番招势，唱念作打尽在其中，生末净丑集于一身，听众禁不住也同愤怒同欢乐。
    那年《潘金莲》进京，演三场后匆匆离去，让未饱眼福的人眼馋三载。今年初夏，魏明伦将携《潘金莲》再度进京。更让人高兴的是自贡川剧团还带了魏明伦的新戏《夕照祁山》，这又是一出反传统的戏，反思诸葛亮的晚年。按魏明伦的说法，“这个戏就是反对神话的诸葛亮，否定历代中国人塑造的人格神，把孔明变成人。”想必这个戏又得在首都戏剧舞台掀起不大不小的波澜，我们等着瞧。
