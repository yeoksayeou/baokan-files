The martial law command's news office reported today that another eye-catching wreath was added to the spot where martyr Cui Guozheng sacrificed his life—Beijing's Chongwenmen overpass. This wreath was sent by the martyr's mother and sister from Huinan County, Jilin Province, to express the family's grief for their loved one.

Cui Guozheng's mother, Wen Guilian, and his sister arrived in Beijing this morning. The Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army, Xiong Guohua, met with the martyr's mother and thanked her for raising such a fine son. Wen Guilian said, "My son is the Party's son, and he is also the country's son." She told the military leaders, "My elder son has sacrificed himself, but I still have a younger son. If the country needs him, I will also send him to join the army."

Cui Guozheng's mother and sister also visited the unit to see the officers and soldiers who had escaped with Cui Guozheng during the breakthrough, encouraging them to overcome difficulties and better complete their missions.

The martyr's mother also wrote a letter to all the officers and soldiers of the martial law troops. The letter said: "Guozheng died to defend Beijing, the capital, and to defend the Party Central Committee. He died for the interests of all ethnic groups. His death is glorious. As his parents, we feel proud and honored to have such a son." It also said, "You have overcome difficulties and made initial achievements in suppressing the counterrevolutionary rebellion. I hope you will continue to strive and achieve new victories for the people."

　　崔国政烈士母亲勉励戒严部队指战员
    再接再厉为人民立新功
    据新华社北京六月十四日电  戒严部队指挥部新闻处消息：今天，崔国政烈士牺牲的地方——北京崇文门过街天桥上又添了一个引人注目的花圈。这是从吉林省辉南县赶来的烈士的母亲和妹妹献上的，以表达全家对亲人的哀思。
    崔国政的母亲温桂琴和妹妹在今天上午到达北京。人民解放军总参谋长迟浩田会见了烈士的母亲，感谢她养育了一个好儿子。温桂琴说：“我的儿子是党的儿子，也是国家的儿子”。她向部队领导表示，我的大儿子牺牲了，还有个小儿子。如果国家需要，我也叫他参军。
    崔国政的母亲和妹妹还到连队看望了与崔国政一起突围幸免于难的干部战士，勉励他们克服困难，更好地完成任务。
    烈士的母亲还给戒严部队全体官兵写了一封信。信中说：“国政是为保卫首都北京、保卫党中央而死的，是为各族人民利益而死的，他的死是光荣的，作为孩子的家长，我们为能有这样的儿子而感到自豪和骄傲。”又说：“你们不怕困难，不怕牺牲，取得了平息反革命暴乱的初步胜利，希望你们再接再厉，为人民再立新功。”
