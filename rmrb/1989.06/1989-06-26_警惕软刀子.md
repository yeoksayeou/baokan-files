Title: Beware of the Soft Blade

In recent times, rumors have been spreading across the country, causing a stir and making people uneasy.

Rumors, in a country as vast as ours, can be considered a "national treasure." During the Xia Dynasty, King Shao Kang sent his son Ru Ai to the Eastern Yi region to engage in subversive activities, relying on rumors; during the Warring States period, the favored minister of the King of Zhao, Guo Kai, framed the general Li Mu and made the elderly general Lian Po wear the "three arrows in a row" black hat, causing him to be unable to serve his country, all through the use of rumors; in the 1930s, the famous actress Ruan Lingyu also met her tragic end amidst a flurry of rumors. Clearly, rumors are a blade that kills without drawing blood.

During the ten years of the "Cultural Revolution," the "Gang of Four" reached the pinnacle of rumor-mongering to achieve their nefarious goal of seizing power. They "turned their hands to create clouds and turned them back to create rain," fabricating countless false and baseless cases, often slapping labels like "capitalist roader" and "traitor" on people, seizing their homes, parading them through the streets, and killing them. This created an atmosphere of fear, leading many to die unjustly under their tyranny. Now, a small number of people with ulterior motives, driven by their hidden agendas, are also eager to spread rumors. They fabricate lies, speak without evidence, and exploit people's naivety and gullibility to sow discord between the Party and the people, and between the military and the civilians. Their ultimate goal is to confuse the public, disrupt the peace, and achieve their hidden objectives.

Facts speak louder than words. Once the truth is revealed, rumors will naturally crumble. I hope that the citizens of the People's Republic can discern right from wrong, not believe in rumors, and not spread them. Let us take concrete actions to maintain the overall stability and unity of the country.

### 警惕软刀子

　　警惕软刀子
    近一个时期以来，全国谣言四起，传得沸沸扬扬，说得有鼻子有眼，闹得人心惶惶。
    谣言，在咱们这样一个泱泱大国可谓“国粹”了。夏代的国王少康，派其子女（音ｒǔ）艾到东夷搞颠覆活动，靠的是谣言；战国时赵王的宠臣郭开置大将李牧于死地，使老将廉颇背上“顷之三遗矢”的黑锅，有心报国却无门，靠的是谣言；三十年代的著名女影星阮玲玉不也是在谣言声中香销玉殒的吗？可见，谣言确是一把杀人不见血的软刀子。
    在十年“文革”中，“四人帮”为了达到其篡党夺权之险恶目的，编造谣言达到了登峰造极的地步。他们“翻手作云覆手雨”，专搞一些无中生有、捕风捉影的冤假错案，动不动就给你扣上“走资派”、“叛徒”等帽子，抄家游斗，置之死地而后快，闹得人人自危，许多人冤死在他们的淫威之下。而现在，有极少数别有用心的人，出于其见不得人的险恶目的，也热中于造谣之道，凭空捏造，信口雌黄，利用人们的单纯和轻信，挑拨党群关系和军民关系，以此混淆视听，扰乱人心，最终无非是妄想达到他们不可告人的目的。
    事实胜于雄辩。真相一旦大白于天下，谣言自然会土崩瓦解。望我共和国公民明辨是非，不信谣，不传谣，以实际行动维护安定团结的大局。
