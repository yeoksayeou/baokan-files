Czechoslovakia's fiscal situation improved in 1988

    New China News Agency, Prague, June 21 - According to the Czechoslovakian Finance Minister Styiskal, who reported at the joint session of the Federal Assembly on June 20, the federal budget for 1988 was slightly better than in previous years. The total fiscal revenue reached 216.28 billion koruna, while expenditures were 214.63 billion koruna, resulting in a surplus of 1.65 billion koruna.

    Styiskal pointed out that the improvement in last year's fiscal situation was mainly due to the accelerated creation of funds. Many enterprises and units completed or exceeded their profit submission plans, and the turnover tax from the commercial sector also increased compared to previous years.

    However, due to the fact that the national income created in the first three years of the 8.5 plan was 3.5 billion koruna less than planned, it caused fiscal tension. The budget surplus for 1988 was achieved under the condition of national austerity measures. The government decided to use the surplus funds to subsidize the Czech and Slovak Republics.

    捷去年财政状况好于往年
    新华社布拉格6月21日电  据捷克斯洛伐克财政部长斯特伊斯卡尔6月20日在联邦议会两院会议上介绍，捷1988年度联邦财政决算状况略好于往年。财政总收入达2162.8亿克朗，支出为2146.3亿克朗，盈余16.5亿克朗。
    斯特伊斯卡尔指出，去年财政状况有所改善的主要原因是资金的创造速度加快。许多企业和单位完成或超额完成利润上缴计划，商业部门的周转税也比前几年有一定增加。
    但是，由于8.5计划头三年所创造的国民收入比计划减少350亿克朗，造成了财政紧张。1988年度的决算盈余是在国家采取紧缩措施的情况下实现的。政府决定，将把盈余资金用于对捷克和斯洛伐克两个共和国的补贴。
