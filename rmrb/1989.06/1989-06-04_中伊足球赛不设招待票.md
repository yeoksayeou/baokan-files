The China-Iran football match scheduled for June 11 will not have any complimentary tickets, as announced by Zhang Jiaxiang, deputy director of the Shenyang Sports Bureau, today in Shenyang.

The match between the Chinese and Iranian teams, to be held at the newly expanded Shenyang People's Stadium, is a crucial game in the Asian zone of the World Cup. Shenyang City has decided that, except for a small number of tickets for public security and media work, all other tickets will be sold. The ticket price is set at 10 yuan. This reform has been widely welcomed by football fans and the general public.
