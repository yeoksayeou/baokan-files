The martial law enforcement command headquarters news office reports: On June 11, Marshal Nie Rongzhen, who is highly respected, wrote a letter to comfort all the troops enforcing martial law. He expressed his deep affection for the people's children in the military, his sincere comfort to all the troops enforcing martial law, and his profound grief for the fallen heroes. The full text is as follows:

Dear comrades of the martial law enforcement troops:

	You are well! You have worked hard!

	The situation over the past few days has clearly improved, and some of the masses who were not fully aware of the facts have also shown a clear change in their attitude towards our Party, government, and military. The day before yesterday, Comrade Xiaoping warmly received the military officers above the rank of colonel from the martial law enforcement troops. This can be said to be an inspection of the initial victory in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, which has had a great inspiring effect throughout the Party, the military, and the people of the entire nation, and has dealt a heavy blow to the enemies both domestically and internationally.

	This time, the martial law enforcement troops entered the city, resolutely executed the orders of the Military Commission, overcame numerous difficulties, fearlessly sacrificed, and fought bravely, dealing a fatal blow to a small group of rioters and achieving a glorious victory. At the same time, they showed love for the capital, love for the people of the capital, and love for the young students. The facts have proven that our military is indeed the people's army, indeed the pillar of people's democratic dictatorship, and indeed the people's iron wall! For this, I extend my sincere greetings to you, and express my deep condolences to the fallen heroes, and my sincere comfort to their families.

	Respectfully,

	Nie Rongzhen

	June 11, 1989

　　聂帅写信慰问戒严部队全体官兵
    向死难烈士表示深切的哀悼
    新华社北京６月１２日电  戒严部队指挥部新闻处消息：６月１１日，德高望重的聂荣臻元帅给戒严部队全体官兵写来一封慰问信，表达了他对人民子弟兵的深切厚爱，对戒严部队全体官兵的亲切慰问，对死难烈士的沉痛悼念。全文如下：亲爱的戒严部队的全体官兵同志们：
    你们好！你们辛苦了！
    最近几天的形势明显好转，一些不明真相的群众对我们的党、政府和军队的态度也有了明显的变化。前天，小平同志亲切接见了戒严部队军以上干部，可以说是对平息反革命暴乱取得初步胜利的检阅，在全党、全军和全国人民中起到了极大的鼓舞作用，给国内外敌人以沉重的打击。
    这次戒严部队进城，坚决地执行军委命令，克服重重困难，不怕牺牲，英勇奋战，给一小撮暴徒以致命打击，取得了辉煌胜利。同时也做到了热爱首都，热爱首都人民，热爱青年学生。事实证明，我军不愧是人民的军队，不愧是人民民主专政的柱石，不愧是人民的钢铁长城！为此，我向你们表示诚挚的问候，并向死难烈士表示深切的哀悼，向他们的家属表示亲切慰问。
    　　谨此顺致
　　敬礼！　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　聂荣臻
    　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　１９８９年６月１１日
