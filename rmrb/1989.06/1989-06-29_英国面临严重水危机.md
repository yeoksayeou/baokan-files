Britain is facing its most severe water crisis since 1976, according to a report by The Times on June 22.

Meteorologists have warned that although temperatures are expected to drop, the drought may continue until next week.

The Southern Water Company has requested that the Department of the Environment declare a large area along the Sussex coast as a drought zone, banning the use of water to irrigate parks, racecourses, and sports fields, prohibiting the use of decorative fountains, and forbidding the washing of cars.

The company stated that groundwater levels in many areas have significantly decreased following a mild winter.

Other water companies have urgently called on users to share a bath, and cars equipped with loudspeakers have been advising people to conserve water and refrain from washing their cars.

    南方水公司已经要求环境部宣布，苏塞克斯沿海大片地区为旱区，禁止放水浇公园、赛马跑道和运动场，禁止使用装饰性的人造喷泉，禁止用水洗汽车。
    这家水公司说，许多地方的地下水位在暖冬后已下降得很低。
    其他一些水公司紧急要求用户合用一缸水洗澡，装着高音喇叭的汽车劝告人们节约用水，不要用水洗汽车。
