Xinhua News Agency, Sofia, June 18th.

Bulgarian Prime Minister Andrey Lukanov issued a statement regarding the issue of certain foreign media spreading rumors that "Bulgaria is expelling Bulgarian Turks." He emphasized that Bulgaria will never force Muslim citizens to leave their homeland.

The Bulgarian newspaper "Rabotnichesko Delo" published this statement on June 18th. Lukanov explained that on May 29th, Bulgarian leader Todor Zhivkov officially announced the opening of the borders, allowing Muslim citizens who wish to visit or settle in Turkey to freely leave or return, and called on Turkey to also open its borders. The Turkish government responded accordingly and began accepting large numbers of Bulgarian citizens requesting to go to Turkey starting in early June.

It is reported that since early June, over 25,000 Muslim citizens requesting to go to Turkey have left Bulgaria.

Given that the number of Muslim citizens applying to leave Bulgaria is still increasing, the Bulgarian government, after refuting some slanderous rumors against Bulgaria, reiterated its long-term policy of allowing citizens to freely leave and return to the country, and made efforts to persuade those wishing to leave not to believe the rumors.

Xinhua News Agency, Istanbul, June 18th.

Turkish Prime Minister Turgut Özal suggested that Turkey and Bulgaria hold talks as soon as possible to resolve the "immigration" issue.

Özal made this suggestion at a press conference held today. He said that Turkey is willing to discuss the signing of an "immigration agreement" with Bulgaria at any time and place agreed upon by both sides.

Since June 2nd, over 40,000 "immigrants" have come to Turkey from Bulgaria. According to the Turkish side, most of these "immigrants" are "Turkish minorities" within Bulgaria, but the Bulgarian side emphasizes that they are "Bulgarian Muslim citizens."

According to Turkish television reports, Turkish Prime Minister Özal visited the Turkey-Bulgaria border yesterday to inspect the reception work for "immigrants" and comforted tens of thousands of "immigrants."

According to Bulgarian reports, there are about 800,000 "Bulgarian Muslim citizens" within Bulgaria, while according to Turkish estimates, there are approximately 1.5 to 2 million "Turkish-speaking minorities—Turkish people" in Bulgaria.

    土耳其建议同保商谈“移民”问题
    新华社索非亚６月１８日电  保加利亚政府总理阿塔纳索夫就某些外国舆论散布“保加利亚驱赶保加利亚的土耳其人”一事发表声明时指出，保绝不会强迫穆斯林公民离开祖国。
    保加利亚《工人事业报》１８日刊登了这项声明。阿塔纳索夫解释说，保加利亚领导人日夫科夫５月２９日正式发表声明，宣布开放边境，允许要求去土耳其访问或定居的穆斯林公民自由出境或回归，并呼吁土耳其也开放边境。土耳其政府随后也作出了相应的反应，并从６月初开始大批接纳要求去土耳其的保公民。
    据悉，自６月初以来，已有２．５万要求去土耳其的穆斯林公民离开了保加利亚。
    鉴于目前申请离开保加利亚的穆斯林公民尚在增加，保政府在驳斥了一些中伤保加利亚的谣言之后，再次重申保允许公民自由出国与回归的长期政策，努力说服想出走的公民不要听信谣言。
    新华社伊斯坦布尔６月１８日电　土耳其总理厄扎尔建议土保两国尽快举行会谈以解决“移民”问题。
    厄扎尔是今天在这里举行的记者招待会上提出上述建议的。他说，土方愿意在土保双方认可的任何时间、任何地点与保方讨论有关签订“移民协定”问题。
    自６月２日至今，从保加利亚来土耳其定居的“移民”已达四万多人。据土方讲，这些“移民”多数为保加利亚境内的“土耳其族”，但保方强调，他们是保加利亚的“穆斯林公民”。
    据土电视台报道，土耳其总理厄扎尔昨天到土保边境视察了“移民”接待工作，并慰问成千上万的“移民”。
    据保方报道，在保境内有约８０万“保加利亚的穆斯林公民”，而据土方估计，在保加利亚有大约１５０万至２００万“操土耳其语的少数民族——土耳其族”。
