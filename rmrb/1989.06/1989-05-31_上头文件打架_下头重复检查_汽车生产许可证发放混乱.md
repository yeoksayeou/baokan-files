	Conflicting Policies and Redundant Inspections: Chaos in the Issuance of Automobile Production Licenses

	According to a report by our reporter Lin Gang: Currently, the issuance of automobile product production licenses is in a state of chaos: multiple licenses are issued, redundant inspections are conducted, and fees are excessively high. Enterprises are struggling to bear the burden and are complaining bitterly.

	Automobiles are multi-purpose transportation tools. Dan Dong Automobile Factory, which produces the "Yellow River" brand of large buses, arranges production of multiple varieties according to user needs. Despite differences in models, the internal layout of the products is slightly different, but their structure and technical performance are the same. However, in addition to obtaining a long-distance bus license from the Ministry of Communications, the Ministry of Construction also conducts a second inspection and issues a certificate for public buses. The 20+ varieties of vehicles produced by the Beijing Automobile Factory are inspected and certified by four central departments. Due to the different technical standards enforced by each department, enterprises have to conduct a six-month factory-wide preparation for inspections from top to bottom, consuming a significant amount of manpower and resources. Without a license, a certain product cannot be produced. Enterprises dare not offend anyone.

	The fees are also chaotic. Some departments conduct quality sampling inspections for free, while others charge high fees. A car factory in Gansu reported that in July of last year, three people from the Beijing Automobile Quality Supervision and Inspection Center came with just a few forms and a few pencils. They used the factory's testing equipment and, with the participation of a large number of accompanying inspectors from the factory, conducted a month-long inspection. Before leaving, they demanded a fee of 26,600 yuan. Including other expenses, the factory spent over 30,000 yuan, equivalent to the profit of 35 buses, and the workers had many complaints. They reported the issue upwards, but there was no result.

	It is reported that the National Industrial Product Production License Office has tried to coordinate this situation multiple times, but without success, because each department has a "mandate"—a red-headed document stamped with the national emblem.

	A factory's chief economist, who did not wish to be named, said: Issuing production licenses can strengthen macro-management and effectively improve product quality, which is a good thing, and we support it. However, some agencies have severe bureaucratism. The policies from above conflict, and the inspections below are redundant, causing trouble for the enterprises and turning a good thing into a bad one. He called for the relevant departments of the State Council to step in and coordinate, straighten out the relationships, and rectify the chaos in the issuance of automobile product production licenses.

### 上头文件打架　下头重复检查  汽车生产许可证发放混乱

　　上头文件打架　下头重复检查
    汽车生产许可证发放混乱
    本报讯  记者林钢报道：目前，汽车产品生产许可证的发放工作出现某些混乱现象：“证”出多门，重复检查，收费过高。企业不堪承受，叫苦连天。
    汽车是多种用途的运输工具。生产“黄河”牌大客车的丹东汽车厂按用户需要，安排多品种生产。尽管型号不同，除本身内部布置稍有区别，其产品结构和技术性能都是相同的。但是，它在取得交通部发放的长途客车许可证外，建设部还要对公共汽车进行二次检查和发证。燕京汽车厂生产的２０多种变型车，有四家中央主管部门参与检查和发证。由于各个部门执行的技术标准不同，企业都得从上到下进行为期半年的全厂性迎检准备工作，耗费不少人力财力。没有许可证，某种产品就不能生产。企业谁都不敢得罪。
    收费也混乱。有的部门质量抽检是免费的，有的则要高额收费。甘肃有一家汽车厂反映，去年７月，中国汽车质量北京监督检验所来了３个人，只带了几份表格，几支铅笔，运用该厂提供的检测仪器，由厂里大量陪检人员参与进行了一个月的检查，临走时要收费２．６６万元。加上其它费用，工厂共花费３万多元，相当于３５辆客车的利润，职工意见纷纷。向上反映，了无结果。
    据悉，对这种现象，全国工业产品生产许可证办公室曾多次出面协调，但无结果，因为各部门都有“尚方宝剑”——盖有国徽图章的红头文件。
    一位不愿透露姓名的工厂总经济师说：发放许可证，可以加强宏观管理，有效提高产品质量，这是桩好事，我们拥护。但是，一些机关官僚主义太严重，上头文件打架，下头重复检查，坑苦了企业，好事变成坏事。他呼吁国务院有关部门出面协调，理顺关系，纠正汽车产品生产许可证发放工作中的混乱现象。
