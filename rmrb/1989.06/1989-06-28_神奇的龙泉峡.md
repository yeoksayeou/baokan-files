In the northern part of Sichuan Province, in the Fan Kuai District of Xuanhan County, there is a picturesque valley known as the "Hundred-Li Gorge," stretching over a hundred miles. The scenery here is as beautiful as a painting, with numerous wonders. The Longquan Gorge is one of these wonders.

The waters of the Longquan Gorge are mysterious and enchanting. On the side of the river near the Ox Stone, there is a large spring that resembles a cauldron. The spring water flows day and night, never stopping. What is astonishing is that during long periods of dry weather, the water in the gorge is clear, but the spring water that emerges is muddy and yellow. Conversely, during long periods of rain, the water in the gorge is murky, but the spring water that emerges is clear and sparkling. Even more remarkable is that this section of the gorge is always half clear and half yellow, with the two colors distinctly separated throughout the seasons. However, once the water flows out of the Longquan Gorge, which is about ten miles long, it becomes uniformly mixed and of one color.

There is a section of the river in the Longquan Gorge known as the Front River. On the surface of the Front River, there is a stretch of mist that is about a mile long, creating a magnificent sight. This mist is present year-round, regardless of the weather or season. It sometimes thickens or thins, sometimes floats or hangs, sometimes appears as a veil or a curtain, and sometimes takes the shape of a dragon or a snake. It is mysterious and ever-changing. During the clear and bright days of spring and summer, the sunlight caresses the thin, transparent mist that lies across the river, making it appear like a long, soft, white silk ribbon. The ribbon and the water surface are almost one, with a hazy glow, making the gorge appear even more secluded. During the gloomy and rainy days of autumn and winter, the mist is long and thick. When the mountain mist rolls in, it merges with this strange mist, covering the mountains and fields with a thick, white veil that neither wind nor rain can disperse. The rugged mountains, flowing streams, and withered grass on both sides of the river are all beautifully revealed within this mist, making the scene indescribably wonderful.

Legend has it that there was once a mischievous dragon in this river, which was slain by a monk surnamed He in front of the Lingguan Temple. The Jade Emperor, believing the report of the dragon king Ao Guang, sent Erlang Shen with heavenly soldiers to capture the monk and make him kneel to pay homage to the dragon. The monk refused, and in a fit of anger, spat out blood and died. The blood stained half of the water in the gorge red, symbolizing his eternal enmity with the dragon. This is the reason why the water in the gorge is distinctly separated. After the monk's death, his heroic deed moved the Yangyu Fairy from the South Sea, who came with her clan to pay their respects. They burned incense and jade, transforming into the mist that lingers in the gorge.

　　神奇的龙泉峡
    陈显涪
    川东北宣汉县樊哙区，有一条风光绮丽的幽谷，长达百里，人称“百里峡”。这百里峡景致秀美如画，奇景荟萃。龙泉峡，便是其中一奇。
    龙泉峡峡水怪迷。牯牛石靠河一侧，有一大如锅口的泉眼。泉水日夜奔涌，长流不断。令人咋舌的是：久晴不雨，峡水清亮，喷出的泉水却浑浊透黄；久雨不晴，峡水昏黄，喷出的泉水却清亮晶莹。更奇特的是，这段峡面常年是半边清亮半边黄，四时泾渭分明。但峡水只要流出这长达十多里的龙泉峡，便又浑然一体、纯然一色了。
    龙泉峡上有一段河面称为前江，前江河面上还有长达里许的奇怪雾霭，蔚为壮观。雾霭无论阴雨阳晴，春秋冬夏，四季常在，从来不散。唯有时浓时淡，时逸时垂，时纱时帘，时龙时蛇……神秘莫测，变幻不定。春夏晴朗清明之时，阳光抚摸横陈河面上薄如蝉翼的透亮纱雾，长长的，软软的，宛若素洁的缎带。缎带与水面若即若离，清辉朦胧，峡谷更显幽寂。秋冬阴雨绵绵，颇多障晦，却是赏雾之良辰佳时。此间整日可见又长又浓的雾霭，一旦山雾涌来，与这怪雾溶为一体，乳白色的纱巾弥漫山野，不飘不聚，不升不降，肥厚臃肿，严严实实。山风吹它不散，秋雨淋它不走。而两岸莽苍的群峦，叠流的溪涧，枯杂的草丛，尽在玲珑寓趣之中，妙不胜言。
    传说，这一带河中有一孽龙作怪，被一姓何的方丈斩于灵官庙前。玉帝偏信敖广所告，派二郎神率天兵擒方丈为孽龙下跪祭奠。方丈不从，一气之下口吐鲜血而殁，血水染红半边峡水，以示与孽龙誓不两立。这就是峡水泾渭分明的原因。方丈死后，他的壮举惊动南海阳鱼仙子，带着本族儿女前来凭吊，点燃朱香玉帛，化作雾霭袅袅……
