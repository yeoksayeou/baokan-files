Hungarian Party Central Committee Issues Statement on Reburial of Nagy
Calls Nagy a Representative Figure of Socialist Reform Policies

BEIJING, June 1 (Xinhua) — The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee issued a statement on the reburial of former Prime Minister Imre Nagy, saying Nagy was an important figure in Hungarian history after 1945 and a representative of socialist reform policies.

Imre Nagy, born in 1896, participated in the workers' movement in his early years and fought bravely for the liberation of Hungary. After liberation, he served as the Minister of Agriculture and was a proponent of Hungary's new agricultural policy. In July 1953, he became the Prime Minister but was later persecuted by the Party's First Secretary, Rakosi. In October 1956, he was reappointed as Prime Minister following widespread public demand. In 1958, he was sentenced to death on charges of "overthrowing the democratic state system" and "treason."

The Party Central Committee's statement, published in today's issue of the Hungarian People's Freedom Newspaper, notes that under the special circumstances of the time, Nagy had to oppose Stalinism's constraints on Hungary, heal national wounds, eliminate foreign interference, and combat counter-revolutionary activities hidden behind the people's uprising. In this struggle, neither the Party nor the government provided him with the necessary support. The statement says that in this incident, Nagy himself also showed a lack of firmness and made mistakes in judging international conditions and consequences, proposing an erroneous foreign policy. However, his name is still associated with national independence, autonomy, and the democratic socialist path of multi-party democracy. The Party Central Committee plenary session held on May 29 determined that the Nagy case was a "fabricated political case" and that "Nagy's execution was illegal."

The Hungarian Supreme Prosecutor's Office has returned Nagy's belongings to his daughter, Nagy Elizabeth. These items include: Nagy's autobiography titled "The Stormy Years," written during his final days in prison, notes titled "Reflections and Memories," some poems, and some letters, as well as medical diagnostic reports.

According to an agreement reached between relevant departments and the victims' families, Nagy and others will be reburied on June 16.

The Hungarian Socialist Workers' Party Central Committee issued a statement on May 31, warning against using the reburial of Nagy and others as a source of national tension, and calling on all Party members and the people of the nation to adopt a "responsible attitude" to make this burial activity a "symbol of national stability."

　　匈党中央就重新安葬纳吉发表公报
    称纳吉是社会主义改革政策代表人物
    新华社布达佩斯６月１日电  匈牙利社会主义工人党中央就重新安葬前政府总理纳吉·伊姆雷发表公报说，纳吉·伊姆雷是１９４５年以后匈牙利历史上的重要人物，他走过的道路与共产主义运动密不可分。他还是社会主义改革政策的代表人物。
    纳吉·伊姆雷，１８９６年生。早年参加工人运动，并为匈牙利解放事业进行英勇斗争。解放后，他当过政府土地部长，是匈新农业政策的倡导者。１９５３年７月，他出任政府总理，后受到党的第一书记拉科西的政治迫害。１９５６年１０月在广大群众要求下，他再次出任总理。１９５８年，他因被指控“推翻民主国家制度”和“叛国”罪被判处死刑。
    匈《人民自由报》今天刊载的党中央公报指出，在当时特殊的环境下，纳吉·伊姆雷既要反对斯大林主义对匈牙利的束缚，又要医治民族创伤；既要排除外来的干涉，又要同隐藏在人民起义后面的反革命活动作斗争。在这场斗争中，党和政府的同僚都没有给他以应有的支持。公报说，在这次事件中，纳吉·伊姆雷本人也表现得不够坚定，在判断国际条件和后果方面出现了失误，提出了错误的外交政策。然而，他的名字仍然是与民族独立、自治和多党制的民主社会主义道路联系在一起的。５月２９日举行的匈党中央全会已确定纳吉事件是一个“捏造的政治案件”，“纳吉·伊姆雷被处死是非法的”。
    匈牙利最高检察院已将纳吉的遗物归还给他的女儿纳吉·伊丽莎白。这些遗物包括：纳吉在被监禁的最后日子里写下的题为《暴风雨的时代》的自传、题为《思考与回忆》的笔记、一些诗歌和一些信件以及医疗诊断书等。
    根据有关部门与被害者的家属达成的协议，纳吉等人将于６月１６日重新安葬。
    匈牙利社会主义工人党中央委员会于５月３１日发表文告，告诫不要使重新安葬纳吉等人成为使国家产生紧张的根源，呼吁全体党员和全国人民采取“负责态度”，使这次安葬活动成为“国家安定的象征”。
