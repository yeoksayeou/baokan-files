On the evening of June 22, a summit of African heads of state on the issue of peace in Angola adopted a joint statement announcing a ceasefire throughout Angola from 00:00 on June 24. This move marks the end of the 14-year-long civil war in Angola and is a major step forward in the Angolan people's efforts towards domestic peace and national reconciliation.

In the mid-1950s, the "Angolan People's Liberation Movement" (MPLA) and the "National Union for the Total Independence of Angola" (UNITA) had jointly fought against Portuguese colonial rule. After Angola gained independence in November 1975, the MPLA declared the establishment of the People's Republic of Angola, while UNITA was driven out of the cities. The two sides then began a protracted civil war. Due to the background of U.S.-Soviet rivalry and confrontation, as well as the intervention of South African troops and Cuban forces, the Angolan issue became extremely complex and could not be resolved for a long time, becoming one of the world's regional hotspots.

In the trend of shifting from military confrontation to political solutions for regional hotspots, Angola, Cuba, South Africa, and the United States finally signed the "Brazzaville Agreement" in December of last year regarding peace in Angola and the realization of Namibian independence. According to the agreement, from the beginning of this year to mid-May, more than 7,000 Cuban troops have withdrawn from Angola. Before that, South African troops had completed their withdrawal from Angola. However, without resolving the contradictions between the Angolan government and UNITA, any peace agreement could be a mere piece of paper. As many observers have pointed out, without national reconciliation, there can be no peace in Angola; and without peace in Angola, there can be no stability in southwestern Africa.

The road to national reconciliation in Angola has been extremely difficult. Last June, after a meeting of the presidents of Angola, Congo, and Gabon, Angolan President Dos Santos first expressed the possibility of negotiating with UNITA. UNITA Chairman Savimbi also repeatedly expressed his willingness to engage in direct talks with the government. However, the two sides have deep-seated differences and suspicions on issues such as political systems and economic policies, repeatedly leading to new conflicts and setbacks in Angola. The Angolan government announced an amnesty law at the beginning of this year, which came into effect on February 4, with the aim of encouraging UNITA to lay down their arms and surrender to the government. UNITA, on the other hand, announced that due to the government's lack of intention to negotiate, it decided to launch a new offensive against the government starting from February 8, including urban guerrilla warfare.

Hopefully, the reconciliation of the two factions in Angola is the will of the people and the trend of the times. Many African leaders have also been actively advocating for this. On April 26, the presidents of Gabon, Zaire, and Congo met in Kinshasa to discuss the Angolan issue. On May 5, the presidents of Angola, Congo, and Gabon held a meeting in Brazzaville on the same topic. On May 16, the heads of state of eight southern and central African countries held a meeting in Luanda on the issue of achieving peace within Angola. Based on this, the joint statement adopted by this summit of African heads of state further laid the foundation for restoring peace in Angola.

It can be predicted that the process of national reconciliation in Angola will not be smooth. New conflicts and problems may arise during the adjustment of political, economic, and military interests between the two sides. However, the bloodshed of the past decade has shown that civil war is a dead end. Only national reconciliation is the wise choice that truly serves the interests of the people. As long as the Angolan people prioritize peace and achieve genuine national reconciliation through negotiations, there is hope.

　　安哥拉民族和解的重大进展
    温宪
    ６月２２日晚，关于安哥拉和平的非洲国家首脑会议通过了一项联合声明，宣布安哥拉全境从６月２４日零时起实行停火。此举标志着持续１４年之久的安哥拉内战的结束，是安人民在国内和平和民族和解过程中取得的重大进展。
    ５０年代中期以后，“安哥拉人民解放运动”（安人运）和“争取安哥拉彻底独立全国联盟”（安盟）等曾为安哥拉摆脱葡萄牙殖民统治而共同斗争。１９７５年１１月安哥拉获得独立后，“安人运”宣布成立安哥拉人民共和国，“安盟”则被赶出城市。双方从此开始了旷日持久的内战。由于安哥拉的两派对立有着美苏争夺和对抗的背景，加之南非入侵和古巴军队的介入，使得安哥拉问题非常复杂，长期得不到解决，成了世界上的地区热点之一。
    在地区热点从军事对抗走向政治解决的潮流中，安哥拉、古巴、南非和美国四方终于在去年１２月就安哥拉和平和实现纳米比亚独立问题签署了《布拉柴维尔协议议定书》。根据协议精神，从今年初至５月中旬，已有７０００余名古巴军队撤离安哥拉。在此之前，南非军队已完成从安哥拉撤军。然而，不解决安哥拉政府与“安盟”之间的矛盾，任何和平协议都可能是一纸空文。正如许多观察家所指出的，没有民族和解，就没有安哥拉的和平；而没有安哥拉的和平，也就不会有西南部非洲的稳定。
    安哥拉在实现民族和解的道路上步履十分艰难。去年６月，安哥拉、刚果和加蓬３国总统会晤后，安哥拉总统多斯桑托斯第一次表示与“安盟”谈判是可能的。“安盟”主席萨文比也多次表示愿意同政府进行直接会谈。但双方在政治体制、经济政策等治国方略上歧见和疑虑甚深，不断导致安国内出现新的冲突和波折。安哥拉政府年初宣布了一项大赦法并于２月４日正式生效，其目的是让“安盟”放下武器，向政府投诚。“安盟”则宣布鉴于政府无意谈判，决定自２月８日起向政府发动新的进攻，包括开展城市游击战。
    希望安两派和解毕竟是人心所向、大势所趋。许多非洲国家领导人也在奔走呼号。４月２６日，加蓬、扎伊尔和刚果总统曾聚会金沙萨，讨论安哥拉问题。５月５日，安哥拉、刚果和加蓬总统在布拉柴维尔就同一主题举行了会晤。５月１６日，８个南部和中部非洲国家首脑在罗安达举行关于实现安哥拉国内和平的会议。在此基础上，这次非洲国家首脑会议所通过的联合声明进一步为恢复安哥拉和平奠定了基础。
    可以预料，安哥拉民族和解的进程不可能坦坦荡荡。双方在政治、经济、军事利益的调整过程中还会出现一些新的矛盾和问题。但十几年的血与火早已表明，内战是没有出路的。只有民族和解才是符合人民利益的唯一明智选择。只要安哥拉人民以“和”为重，通过谈判实现真正的民族和解是有希望的。
