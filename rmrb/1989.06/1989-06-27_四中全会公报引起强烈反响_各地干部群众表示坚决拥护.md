He said that the Fourth Plenary Session was convened at a critical moment for our Party and state. Li Peng's report at the meeting on the errors made by Comrade Zhao Ziyang in the anti-Party, anti-socialist turmoil made us see that the errors made by Comrade Zhao Ziyang are serious, and the consequences are also serious. Comrade Deng Xiaoping's several speeches are weighty and far-sighted, with both practical significance for guiding current work and profound historical significance. We must think about the past and the future, and we must definitely study Comrade Deng Xiaoping's important speech well. He said that to do a good job in the construction of the Hainan Special Economic Zone, we must, in the future, strengthen the Party's construction, more boldly and more handsomely carry out reform and opening-up, resolutely combat corruption, and strengthen ideological and political work.
