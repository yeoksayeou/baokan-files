	Chongqing Publishing House Allocates Funds for Publishing Scientific Books

	Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, June 15th – (Reporter Ma Ping) To alleviate the difficulty in publishing scientific and academic works, Chongqing Publishing House allocated one million yuan last year to establish the Chongqing Publishing House Scientific and Academic Works Publication Fund, which has been warmly received by the scientific and academic community.

	The director of the Science and Technology Editing Department, Chen Jingzhang, told the reporter that currently, the publication of scientific monographs faces the "difficulties of publishing, buying, and selling" books. Coupled with the reduction in funding for materials and periodicals by most units, and the increase in printing and paper costs, the difficulty in publishing scientific monographs has become more pronounced. Therefore, the publication of such books often results in losses. Director Chen introduced that since Chongqing Publishing House resumed operations in 1980, a significant portion of its profits has been used to subsidize the publication of scientific monographs. In recent years, the house has annually published an average of over 20 outstanding scientific and academic works in the fields of science, engineering, medicine, and agriculture, rescuing a batch of academic monographs.

	During the interview, enthusiastic editors showed the reporter one published academic monograph after another: "Genetic Mineralogy and Ore-Finding Mineralogy" is an academic monograph that was once overlooked. The author came to the publishing house with a try-it-and-see attitude. The publishing house found that the manuscript had significant academic value and decided to publish the monograph at a loss. After its publication, the monograph attracted widespread attention both domestically and internationally and was considered "a groundbreaking work in the field of genetic mineralogy in China," playing a major guiding and promoting role in China's deep ore-finding efforts. "Applied Mathematics and Mechanics" is a monthly journal edited by the renowned Chinese scientist Qian Weichang, which has high academic value. It was previously published by another publishing house but faced difficulties due to its high academic level and limited circulation. After learning of this situation, Chongqing Publishing House took the initiative to publish it. For this, Chongqing Publishing House subsidizes several tens of thousands of yuan annually.

　　重庆出版社专款出版科技书
    新华社重庆六月十五日电  （记者马平）为缓解科学学术著作出版难的矛盾，重庆出版社去年拨出一百万元专款，设立重庆出版社科学学术著作出版基金，受到科学学术界的热情赞扬。
    这家出版社科技编辑室主任陈敬章告诉记者，当前科技专著的出版普遍存在“出书难、买书难、卖书难”的矛盾，再加上多数单位资料报刊费用的削减，印刷费用、纸张的涨价，科技专著“出书难”的矛盾更为突出。所以，这类图书的出版往往都要赔钱。陈主任介绍说，重庆出版社自一九八Ｏ年恢复以来，将大部分盈利资金用于补贴出版科技专著。近年来，全社年平均出版理工医农优秀科学学术著作二十余部，挽救了一批学术专著。
    采访中，热心的编辑们拿出一部部已出版的学术专著向记者介绍：《成因矿物学与找矿矿物学》是一部曾遭冷遇的学术专著，书的作者抱着试一试的想法来到出版社，出版社发现这部书稿很有学术价值，当即决定赔钱出版这部专著。专著问世后，引起国内外的广泛重视，被认为是“我国成因矿物学研究的空前著作”，对我国深部找矿起了重大的指导和促进作用。《应用数学力学》杂志，是我国著名科学家钱伟长主编的一本有很高学术价值的月刊，过去一直由其他出版社出版，但由于这本杂志发表的论文学术层次很高，发行量十分有限，出版遇到了困难，这一情况被重庆出版社知道后，主动出版，为此，重庆出版社每年就要补贴好几万元。
