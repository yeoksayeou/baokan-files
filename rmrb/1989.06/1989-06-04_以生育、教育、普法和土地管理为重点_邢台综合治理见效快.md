	With birth control, education, legal awareness, and land management as key areas, Xingtai has achieved quick results in comprehensive management.

	Xinhua News Agency reporter Ma Chengguang reports: For a long time, issues such as family planning, quality education, legal construction, and land management have been considered four major challenges. In recent years, the Xingtai region of Hebei Province has taken these four areas as key tasks and conducted comprehensive management without hesitation, achieving noticeable results.

	With the deepening of rural reforms and the development of a commodity economy, the Communist Party of China's Xingtai Regional Committee and the Regional Government acutely felt that the population had become a heavy burden for economic revitalization. Without strict control over birth rates and strict prohibition of house building that encroaches on arable land, the situation was becoming untenable. Moreover, the majority of farmers had low cultural literacy and weak legal awareness, making it difficult for them to adapt to the needs of modernizing agriculture and developing a commodity economy, even to take a small step forward. Therefore, in recent years, they have resolutely undertaken comprehensive management.

	To improve family planning, the Xingtai region has, on the one hand, focused on propaganda and education, creating a strong public opinion; on the other hand, it has ensured organizational implementation, appointing assistants at the county and township levels to oversee family planning, who enjoy the same treatment as deputy-level officials, and taking responsibility to the end. According to statistics, since last September, after half a year of intense efforts, more than 50,000 births and pregnancies have been reduced.

	While focusing on family planning, the Xingtai Regional Committee and the Regional Government have also decided to change the low cultural literacy of the workforce. They have promoted vocational and technical education that integrates "teaching, research, production, business, and service" across the entire region, as well as adult education that encourages "universal enrollment, classified teaching, showcasing talents, and diversified enrichment."

	In conjunction with cultural and scientific knowledge education, the Xingtai region has also intensified legal education in recent years, ensuring that 80% of the legal education targets in the entire region have learned basic legal knowledge. This has enabled timely resolution of issues such as theft, gambling, fighting, superstition, illegal occupation of residential plots, and neighborhood disputes. In recent years, none of the 1,161 villages in the 110 townships in the region have had criminal cases, and social order has become stable.

	Reporters in Xingtai's rural areas have seen that some slogans promoting family planning and legal construction are written on the walls of various villages and towns; the situation of a few over-quota birth families being heavily fined is written in large characters on local propaganda boards; some households are using small wheelbarrows to fill in abandoned ponds at the edges of villages to create residential plots. It is said that due to Xingtai's strict controls, the phenomenon of rural households randomly occupying arable land for construction has been basically eliminated. In addition to new land development, the Xingtai region has increased its arable land by more than 20,000 mu in recent years.

### 以生育、教育、普法和土地管理为重点  邢台综合治理见效快

　　以生育、教育、普法和土地管理为重点
    邢台综合治理见效快
    本报讯  新华社记者马成广报道：一向被人们视为四大难题的计划生育、素质教育、法制建设和土地管理，近几年被河北省邢台地区作为四项重点工作，毫不含糊地进行综合治理，迅速取得明显效果。
    随着农村改革的深入和商品经济的发展，中共邢台地委和行署痛切地感到，人口已成了振兴经济的沉重负担，不严格控制生育和严禁建房占用耕地，实在不行了；而大多数农民的文化素质低下、法制观念淡薄，又根本不适应建设现代化农业和发展商品经济的需要，甚至要前进一小步都很困难。于是，近年来他们横下一条心综合治理。
    为搞好计划生育，邢台地区一方面抓宣传教育，大造舆论；一方面抓组织落实，从县到乡为分管计划生育工作的党政主要领导人设专抓计划生育、享受同级副职待遇的助理员，一抓到底。据统计，从去年９月以来，狠抓了半年多，就已减少５万多人出生和怀孕。
    在抓计划生育工作的同时，邢台地委和行署还下决心改变劳动者文化素质低的状况，在全地区抓了“教学、科研、生产、经营、服务”五位一体的职业技术教育和“全民报名，分类施教，各展其材，多方致富”的成人教育。
    配合文化科学知识教育，邢台地区近年来还大抓了普法教育，使全地区８０％的普法对象学到了基本的法制知识，从而使盗窃、赌博、打架、迷信、强占宅基、邻里纠纷等问题都及时得到了处理。全地区１１０个乡、１１６１个村近年来没有发生刑事案件，社会治安趋于稳定。
    记者在邢台农村看到，一些宣传计划生育和法制建设的常年性标语口号书写在各村镇的墙壁上；少数超生户受重罚的情况被用大字写在当地的宣传牌上；一些建房户正用小推车一车车地推土填垫村边荒置的水坑做宅基。据说，由于邢台地区卡得严，农村建房乱占耕地现象基本杜绝，加上新造地，邢台地区近年来新增耕地２万多亩。
