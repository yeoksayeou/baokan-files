The Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission received a telegram from the Party committees of Fujian and Jiangxi provinces and the Party group of the Supreme People's Procuratorate, expressing their firm commitment to implementing the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council.

To the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission:

On the morning of June 5, the Party Central Committee and the State Council issued the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country." The Provincial Party Committee immediately convened a meeting of provincial leaders to listen and study the letter, and required all prefectures, cities, and provincial departments to organize serious study. On the morning of June 6, the Provincial Party Standing Committee held an expanded meeting, attended by leaders of the Provincial People's Congress, Provincial Government, Provincial Military Region, Provincial Political Consultative Conference, and Provincial Discipline Inspection Commission, as well as relevant department heads, to continue studying and discussing the letter. Everyone unanimously agreed that the purpose of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in the capital was to negate the Party's leadership, negate the socialist system, and overthrow the People's Republic of China; unanimously supported the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission's decisive action to suppress the rebellion; and expressed gratitude and respect to the People's Liberation Army for their outstanding contributions in this struggle!

Based on our serious study of the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" issued by the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and starting from the actual situation in Fujian, we have studied and arranged the current work, proposing six opinions for implementation, requiring all Party members, cadres, and the people of the province to firmly respond to the call of the Party and the government, resolutely execute the deployment of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, and unswervingly maintain consistency with the Party Central Committee. We are determined to maintain the stability and unity of Fujian through practical actions, stabilize the situation in Fujian, protect the achievements of reform and opening up, and contribute to the stabilization of the national situation. The entire province should unite as one, work together, and continue to push forward the construction and reform.

To the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission:

On June 4, upon learning of the swift suppression of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in Beijing by the martial law troops, the Provincial Party Committee immediately convened a meeting of the Standing Committee for serious discussion. In the evening, a meeting of Party members and responsible cadres from the provincial and Nanchang city levels was held, and arrangements were made for work in Jiangxi based on the spirit of the Central Committee. On June 5, the heads of the Provincial Party Committee, Provincial Government, and other leading bodies seriously studied the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, analyzed the current situation, and further studied specific measures to stabilize Jiangxi and maintain the overall situation. At the same time, a document was issued to all parts of the province for implementation.

Everyone unanimously agreed that the turmoil deliberately created by a small number of people with ulterior motives had developed into a shocking counter-revolutionary rebellion. The decisive action of the martial law troops of the People's Liberation Army to suppress this rebellion is a just action and is in line with the wishes and fundamental interests of the people of the capital and the country. Everyone expressed their firm support for the major decisions of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, and their firm support for the martial law troops in the capital to perform their sacred mission of defending the People's Republic of China and the capital in accordance with the law. Respect is also expressed to the heroic People's Liberation Army martial law troops and the broad public security and armed police forces. Everyone expressed their determination to respond to the call of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, to distinguish right from wrong, to unite as one, to take swift action, and to firmly fight against the small number of people who created the rebellion, to protect the achievements of the revolution, construction, and reform. We will cherish and fully maintain the politically stable situation in our province, strive to do a good job in all aspects of work, stabilize Jiangxi, and maintain the overall situation. The following measures have been taken:

1. Immediately organize all Communist Party members, the broad masses of the people, and people from all walks of life to seriously study the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, and further study the series of important speeches by Li Peng, Yang Shangkun, and other central leaders and the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries on opposing and stopping the turmoil and maintaining stability, and the June 4 editorial of the "Liberation Army News." The "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council must be known to every household and every person. Through study, everyone's ideological understanding must be unified with the spirit of the Central Committee, firmly believing in the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, firmly believing that the Party and the government have the ability to stop the rebellion and stabilize the overall situation of the country. Unswervingly maintain political consistency with the Party Central Committee, distinguish right from wrong, consider the overall situation, take swift action, and stand up to firmly fight against the small number of people who created the rebellion, and not do anything that hurts the feelings of the people and pleases the enemy.

2. Mobilize all Party members, cadres, and key personnel from all aspects to clearly and meticulously do a good job in ideological and political work. Whether in offices, factories, schools, shops, or neighborhoods, work must be done deeply and meticulously, patiently educating young students and the broad masses not to believe and spread rumors, not to engage in any form of linkage, and to firmly resist the instigation and incitement of a small number of people with ulterior motives. Communist Party members must set an example and take the lead in everything. Every Party member, cadre, and the masses must not only actively maintain stability and unity but also educate their children and relatives not to do anything that harms stability and unity. Party and government organizations at all levels must support key personnel to work boldly and fully play the role of key personnel. All levels and units must have a clear attitude in their work, insist on positive guidance, and pay attention to methods.

3. Take decisive measures to maintain normal order in all aspects. Educate the broad cadres and workers to stay at their posts, do a good job in production, ensure supply, and actively maintain normal social order. Schools must strengthen management, organize teaching activities according to normal teaching plans and requirements, and resolutely expose and resist the conspiracy of a small number of people to "vacate schools." Seriously warn those who instigate trouble and disrupt normal order, and if they do not heed the warning and insist on their own way, they will bear the consequences.

4. Heighten vigilance, strengthen security work, and actively maintain social order. Educate the broad cadres and the masses to support the public security police and armed police soldiers, and do a good job in the security of key departments, key positions, factories, and shops, maintain good urban traffic order and social security, and prevent criminals from taking advantage of the situation to cause trouble. Strictly prohibit forced boarding of vehicles, rushing of railways, and rushing of offices, factories, schools, and shops. Do not allow the establishment of illegal organizations, and once discovered, resolutely abolish them. Strictly prohibit the posting of big and small character posters, the distribution of various inciting leaflets, and the delivery of various inciting speeches in accordance with the law. Those who shout and attack, and curse the Party and state leaders with reactionary slogans and post reactionary slogans must be clearly opposed. Those who engage in beating, smashing, looting, and burning must be severely punished in accordance with the law and will not be lenient.

We firmly believe that under the correct leadership of the Party Central Committee and the State Council, the people of Jiangxi, who have a glorious revolutionary tradition, are aware and consider the overall situation and will certainly make due contributions to stabilizing Jiangxi and maintaining the overall situation.

To the Party Central Committee:

After the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" was issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, the Party group of the Supreme People's Procuratorate immediately convened an expanded meeting of the Party group, unanimously expressing their firm support for the Party Central Committee's decisive action to swiftly suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and expressing their high respect to the entire army, armed police forces, and public security police who participated in this suppression of the rebellion. At this crucial moment that decides the fate of the Party and the country, we must stand firm and clearly maintain consistency with the Party Central Committee. Actively support the martial law troops in executing the martial law mission and suppressing the rebellion in various aspects of work.

At the same time, the Supreme People's Procuratorate issued an urgent notice to the procuratorates of all provinces, autonomous regions, and municipalities directly under the Central Government, and military procuratorates on June 5, seriously requiring all levels of procuratorates and all procuratorial personnel to: (1) Seriously study the "Open Letter to All Communist Party Members and the People of the Whole Country" issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, fully understand the seriousness and harm of this counter-revolutionary rebellion, fully understand the process of this struggle from the turmoil created by a small number of people developing into a counter-revolutionary rebellion, stand firm, clearly maintain consistency with the Party Central Committee, and be tempered and tested in this sharp and intense class struggle. (2) Strictly perform legal duties, closely cooperate with public security, courts, and other departments, use legal means to severely punish counter-revolutionary rebellion elements and various serious criminal elements who engage in beating, smashing, looting, and burning, and make due contributions to the swift suppression of this serious counter-revolutionary rebellion and the restoration of normal social order. (3) Continue to focus on investigating and prosecuting cases of embezzlement and bribery to promote clean government construction.

    中央、国务院、中央军委：
    ６月４日，当我们获知戒严部队迅速平息北京发生的反革命暴乱的消息后，省委立即召开常委会议进行了认真的讨论。晚上，召开了省直和南昌市党员负责干部会议，根据中央精神，对如何做好江西的工作，进行了部署。５日，省委、省政府等几套班子的负责同志又认真学习了《中共中央、国务院告全体共产党员和全国人民书》，并分析当前形势，进一步研究了稳定江西、维护大局的具体措施，同时，以省委、省政府文件下发全省各地贯彻落实。
    大家一致认为，极少数别有用心的人蓄意制造的动乱，已经发展成为一场骇人听闻的反革命暴乱。解放军戒严部队果断地平息这场暴乱，完全是正义的行动，是符合首都人民和全国人民的愿望和根本利益的。一致表示，坚决拥护党中央、国务院、中央军委的重大决策，坚决支持首都戒严部队依法履行捍卫人民共和国和首都的神圣使命，并对英雄的中国人民解放军首都戒严部队和广大公安、武警部队表示敬意。大家表示，坚决响应党中央、国务院的号召，擦亮眼睛，团结一致，迅速行动起来，与制造暴乱的极少数人进行坚决的斗争，保卫革命、建设和改革的成果。十分珍惜和全力维护我省安定团结的政治局面，努力做好各方面的工作，稳定江西、维护大局。并采取了以下措施：
    一、立即组织全体共产党员、广大人民群众和各界爱国人士，认真地学习《中共中央、国务院告全体共产党员和全国人民书》，进一步学习李鹏、杨尚昆等中央领导同志和老一辈无产阶级革命家关于反对和制止动乱、维护稳定的一系列重要讲话，学习《解放军报》６月４日的社论。务必使《中共中央、国务院告全体共产党员和全国人民书》家喻户晓，人人皆知。通过学习，真正把大家的思想认识统一到中央的精神上来，坚信党中央、国务院的正确领导，坚信党和政府有能力制止暴乱，稳定全国大局。坚定不移地在政治上同党中央保持一致，明辨是非，顾全大局，迅速行动起来，挺身而出与制造暴乱的极少数人作坚决的斗争，而不做任何亲痛仇快的事情。
    二、把所有的党员、干部和各方面的骨干动员起来，旗帜鲜明、深入细致地做好思想政治工作。无论是机关、工厂、学校、商店、街道，都要把工作做深做细，耐心教育青年学生和广大群众不轻信和传播谣言，不进行任何形式的串联，坚决抵制极少数别有用心的人的挑拨和煽动。共产党员要处处以身作则，起模范带头作用。每个党员、干部和群众不仅自己要积极维护安定团结，而且要教育自己的子女、亲属不做有损于安定团结的事。各级党政组织要支持骨干理直气壮地开展工作，充分发挥骨干的作用。各级各单位在工作中既要态度鲜明，又要坚持正面疏导，注意方法。
    三、采取坚决措施，维护各方面的正常秩序。教育广大干部、职工坚守岗位，搞好生产，保障供给，积极维护社会正常秩序。学校要加强管理，按照正常的教学计划和要求组织教学活动，坚决揭露和抵制极少数人策划的“空校”阴谋。严正警告那些挑起事端，破坏正常秩序的幕后策划者和组织者，如不听劝告，一意孤行，后果自负。
    四、提高警惕，加强安全保卫工作，积极维护社会治安。教育广大干部和群众大力支持公安干警和武警战士，切实做好首脑机关、要害部位和工厂、商店的安全保卫工作，维护好城市的交通秩序和社会治安，严防不法分子乘机破坏。严禁强行乘车、冲击铁路，严禁冲击机关、工厂、学校、商店。决不允许成立非法组织，一经发现，坚决取缔。依法严禁张贴大小字报、散发各种煽动性的传单、发表各种煽动性演讲。对于呼喊攻击、谩骂党和国家领导人的反动口号、张贴反动标语的，要旗帜鲜明地予以反对。对于那些搞打、砸、抢、烧的要依法严惩，决不手软。
    我们坚信，在党中央、国务院的正确领导下，富有光荣革命传统的江西人民是有觉悟的，是顾全大局的，一定能为稳定江西、维护大局作出应有的贡献。
