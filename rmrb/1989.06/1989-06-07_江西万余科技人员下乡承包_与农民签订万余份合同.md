Xinhua News Agency, Nanchang, June 7th.

This year, over ten thousand "scholars" in Jiangxi have gone to the fields and paths to engage in technical contracting. Preliminary statistics show that so far, 126 contracting groups have been formed, consisting of 11,166 technical personnel, and 13,314 contracts have been signed with farmers.

This is a major measure taken by Jiangxi Province to promote a new level of agricultural production this year. Various levels of government attach great importance to it and are making great efforts to ensure its implementation. The Yichun Administrative Bureau dispatched 33 cadres to various counties to help establish more than ten contracting groups, focusing on promoting ten practical technologies such as "double hybrid high-yield rice cultivation model," "optimal formula fertilization," and "improving medium and low-yield fields." Jiujiang City selected a number of technical cadres from ministries and provincial-level enterprises to serve as deputy county magistrates in various counties, specifically responsible for doing a good job in scientific and technological support for agriculture. The Science and Technology Commission of Jian and the Seed Company jointly contracted the hybrid rice seed production technology in the grain-producing areas of Yongfeng, Xingan, and Jishui counties.

Various places, in accordance with the requirements of the provincial government, have focused on improving the production of grain, cotton, oil crops, and forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries, and have combined this with the "Spark Program" and World Bank loan projects.

　　江西万余科技人员下乡承包
    与农民签订万余份合同
    新华社南昌６月７日电  （记者卢晶）今年以来，江西万余名“秀才”来到田头陌上搞技术承包。据初步统计，到目前为止，已组成由１１１６６名科技人员参加的１２６个承包集团，并与农民签订了１３３１４份合同。
    这是江西省为今年农业生产上新台阶采取的一项重大措施，各级政府都十分重视，花大力气抓落实。宜春行署派３３位干部到各县帮助组建成１０多个承包集团，重点推广“双杂吨粮模式栽培”、“优化配方施肥”、“改造中低产田”等十项实用技术。九江市从部、省属企业中抽调一批科技干部到各县任科技副县长，具体负责做好科技支农工作。吉安地区科委与种子公司联合承包了产粮区永丰、新干、吉水三县的杂交水稻的制种技术。
    各地根据省政府要求，把技术承包的重点放到抓好粮、棉、油大田作物及林、牧、渔等生产方面，并结合“星火计划”及世界银行贷款项目进行。
