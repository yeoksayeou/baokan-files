This year marks the 2,540th anniversary of Confucius' birth. Both Qufu City and the National Museum of China will hold solemn memorial ceremonies. Do you know about the grand ceremony of Confucius worship in Japan, a country adjacent to China across the sea? The author had the fortune to participate in the Confucius worship ceremony in Ashikaga City, Tochigi Prefecture, Japan. The ceremony was solemn, full of ancient customs, and quite interesting.

The Confucius Temple in Ashikaga City is one of the four largest and most complete temples left from the post-war period in Japan. It is located 80 kilometers north of Tokyo within the Ashikaga School, with a temple hall, surrounding walls, and a gate named Xingtan. Inside the temple hall, there is a bronze statue of Confucius. Although the scale of the temple is much smaller than the Temple of Confucius in Qufu, many parts of it are surprisingly similar.

The Confucius worship ceremony in Ashikaga City is held every year on November 23rd. On that day, more than 200 people, including key officials from the Ashikaga City government, key personnel from local organizations in Ashikaga City, and notable figures from Tokyo and other related units, participate in the ceremony. The entire worship ceremony consists of fifteen procedures and is solemn and grand.

1. The host of the worship ceremony, the "priest," and the bell ringer enter the hall to check and arrange the preparations inside the hall.

2. At 10:00 AM, the bell is rung three times, marking the official start of the worship ceremony.

3. The main participants (about 20 people) and the general participants line up and enter the temple. They use wooden ladles to rinse their mouths with water at the Xingtan gate before passing through. The main participants enter the hall from the eastern steps and stand in front of the statue of Confucius. The general participants take their seats in front of the hall.

4. The host of the worship ceremony stands on the eastern side of the hall.

5. The host announces the start of the worship ceremony. The participants in the hall bow in front of the statue of Confucius and then stand in order according to the sequence of initial offering, secondary offering, revised offering, and other offerings on both sides of the statue of Confucius, behind the offering table and the offerings.

6. The general participants in front of the hall stand up and bow.

7. Three monks walk to the front of the statue of Confucius, bow, and then sit cross-legged.

8. The door in front of the statue of Confucius is opened, and the monks chant the welcoming words.

9. Music is played. The initial offering, secondary offering, revised offering, and other offerings move the offerings of chicken, fish, meat, beans, and vegetables from the table to the offering board in front of the statue of Confucius. The music stops.

10. The host of the worship ceremony kneels and offers incense.

11. Music is played. The initial offering presents wine to the deity (Confucius). After the wine is presented, the music stops.

12. The worship ceremony is completed.

13. The "priest" chants the farewell words to send off the deity.

14. The host announces the end of the worship ceremony to all participants.

15. The bell is rung twice, and the participants in the hall exit from both sides of the steps.

After the entire worship ceremony is completed, related lectures are held in front of the hall.

    足利市的孔子庙是日本战后遗留下来的四个孔庙中较大、较完整的一处，座落在东京以北八十公里处的足利学校内，有庙殿、围墙，并设有杏坛门，庙殿内有孔子的铜像。其规模尽管比曲阜孔庙小的多，但许多地方却有着惊人的相似之处。
    足利市的孔子祭奠仪式是在每年的十一月二十三日。届时有足利市政府的主要官员、足利市地方团体组织的主要负责人和东京等地的一些有关单位以及社会名流等共二百多人参加。整个祭奠仪式共分十五道程序，庄严而隆重。

    四、祭奠主持人走到殿内东侧站定。

    七、三名和尚走到孔子像前，礼拜后盘腿坐定。
    八、打开孔子像前的封门，和尚诵迎神词。
