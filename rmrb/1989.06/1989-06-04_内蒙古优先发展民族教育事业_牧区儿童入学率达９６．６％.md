Inner Mongolia Prioritizes Development of Ethnic Minority Education
School Enrollment Rate for Pastoral Area Children Reaches 96.6%

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, June 4th - In recent years, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region has implemented the "Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy," taking active measures to prioritize and focus on the development of ethnic minority education.

In developing ethnic minority education, the region first improved the basic education and school conditions in pastoral areas. In 1986 and 1987, the region allocated 400 million yuan annually, along with funds from various levels of government, to develop ethnic minority education. This ensured that 80 schools in 18 border pastoral counties met the requirements of the "Law on Regional Ethnic Autonomy" for "boarding as the main method, scholarships as the main support, and public ethnic primary and secondary schools." In the past two years, the region has allocated an additional 2,000 million yuan to gradually address the basic education needs of 350 schools in inland pastoral and semi-pastoral areas. Currently, the enrollment rate for children aged 8 to 12 in pastoral areas has reached 96.6%.

Adjusting the structure of ethnic minority secondary education has accelerated the development of ethnic minority vocational and technical education. Compared to 1983, the number of ethnic minority agricultural vocational schools has increased by 37, and the number of ethnic minority vocational school students has increased by 10.7 times. The ratio of ethnic minority high school students to vocational high school students is 1:0.47. Various types of ethnic minority vocational and technical education have laid the foundation for cultivating ethnic minority talents with practical skills, and have also opened up new avenues for ethnic minority students to find employment.

Previously, the region's colleges and universities only offered Mongolian language courses in the field of education. In recent years, courses in agriculture, forestry, finance, and other fields have been added. Starting in 1987, 12 vocational schools directly under the region have opened ethnic minority classes each year. These measures have created opportunities for Mongolian language high school graduates to continue their education. At the same time, the region has adjusted its exchange enrollment policy with cooperating provinces, increasing the proportion of Mongolian language graduates studying outside the region. This year, more than 100 Mongolian language graduates will study at colleges and universities outside the region. Currently, the region has 24.8 Mongolian ethnic college students per 10,000 people.

　　内蒙古优先发展民族教育事业
    牧区儿童入学率达９６．６％
    据新华社呼和浩特６月４日电  （新华社通讯员钱咏虹）内蒙古自治区近年来根据《民族区域自治法》，采取积极措施，优先、重点发展民族教育事业。
    在发展民族教育中，自治区首先改善牧区基础教育和办学条件。１９８６年、１９８７年，自治区每年拿出４００万元，加上各级政府的拨款，用来发展民族教育，使全区１８个边境牧区旗县的８０所苏木（乡）中心校实现了《民族区域自治法》提出的“寄宿为主、助学金为主、公办民族小学和民族中学”的要求。去年和今年，自治区又拿出２０００万元，逐步解决内地牧区和半农半牧区３５０所苏木中心校的基础教育问题。现在，牧区８至１２岁的儿童入学率达到９６．６％。
    调整民族中等教育结构，加快了民族职业技术教育的步伐。今年与１９８３年比，少数民族农职业中学增加了３７所，少数民族职业中学在校生增加了１０．７倍。少数民族高中在校生与职业高中在校生的比例为１∶０．４７。各类少数民族职业技术教育为培养有一技之长的少数民族人才奠定了基础，也为少数民族学生就业开辟了新的渠道。
    过去，全区高等院校蒙古语授课专业只有师范类。近年来，增加了农牧、林业、财经等类。从１９８７年开始，每年有１２所自治区直属中专开办民族班。这些都为蒙古语授课的初高中毕业生创造了连贯的继续升学的机会。同时，调整了与协作省区交换招生政策，增加蒙古语授课毕业生出区外上大学的比例。今年，全区又将有百余名蒙古语授课毕业生赴区外大专院校上学。目前，自治区每万人口中蒙古族普通高等学校在校生为２４．８人。
