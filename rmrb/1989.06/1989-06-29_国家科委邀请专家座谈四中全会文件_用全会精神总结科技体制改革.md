The State Science and Technology Commission invited experts to discuss the Fourth Plenary Session documents and Deng Xiaoping's important speech. The experts proposed that the spirit of the documents and the speech should be used to summarize the experiences and lessons of China's science and technology system reform since 1985. The correct aspects should be maintained, the insufficient aspects should be improved, and the erroneous aspects should be corrected. Based on the summary of experiences, the reform should be further deepened.

The experts fully affirmed the mainstream and direction of the science and technology system reform in recent years. Tang Aoqing, the director of the National Natural Science Foundation, said: Under the guidance of the policies and lines of the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, China's science and technology system reform has achieved remarkable results. In terms of focusing on the main battlefield of economic construction, developing high-tech research and development, and basic research, a reasonable three-tier structure has been formed, and the enthusiasm of a large number of scientific and technological personnel has been widely mobilized. However, in the past few years, propaganda of Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, self-reliance, and hard work has been insufficient, which is a big lesson. In the future, we must combine the reform and opening up in the field of science and technology with the adherence to the four cardinal principles.

Everyone pointed out in their speeches that the erroneous advocacy of "short-term behavior" in recent years has had adverse effects on China's scientific and technological work. Beijing University Professor Tang Youqi said, we are a country with 11 billion people, and we must consider long-term interests and formulate policies. The short-term behavior reflected in education, population, and resource development in recent years has already caused irreparable losses.

Everyone believes that the commercialization of scientific and technological achievements has played an immeasurable role in the rapid transformation of science and technology into productive forces. However, the "money-oriented" trend in society has also corrupted the scientific and technological community, and the experiences and lessons in this aspect should be summarized with the spirit of the Fourth Plenary Session.

Fan Weidang, deputy general manager of China's Unified Coal Mines Corporation, and Hou Yunde, director of the Institute of Virology at the Chinese Academy of Preventive Medicine, pointed out that China's scientific and technological modernization ultimately depends on China's scientific and technological forces. Therefore, it is crucial to build a team that is strong in both ideology and professional skills. On the scientific and technological front, we should vigorously advocate patriotism, dedication, cooperation, hard work, and the spirit of serving the Chinese people wholeheartedly. Yuan Yaxiang, the youngest researcher at the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who is 29 years old, said with deep feelings: We should educate young scientific and technological personnel on the national situation, so that everyone can work hard on the basis of understanding China's history and current situation. He also emphasized that we should mainly rely on our own strength to cultivate a new generation of high-level scientific and technological talents.

Song Jian and others spoke at the meeting.

　　国家科委邀请专家座谈四中全会文件     
    用全会精神总结科技体制改革
    本报北京６月２９日讯  记者王友恭报道：今天上午，国务委员、国家科委主任宋健在此间邀请首都部分著名科学技术专家座谈党的十三届四中全会文件和邓小平同志重要讲话。专家们提出，要用文件和讲话精神总结１９８５年来我国科技体制改革的经验教训，正确的要坚持，不足的要改进，错误的要纠正，要在总结经验的基础上进一步深化这一改革。
    专家们充分肯定近几年来科技体制改革的主流和方向。国家自然科学基金会主任唐敖庆说：在党的十一届三中全会以来的方针、路线指导下，我国的科技体制改革取得了举世瞩目的成就。科技工作在面向经济建设主战场、发展高技术研究开发和基础研究方面，已经形成了三个不同层次的合理格局，广泛地调动了广大科技人员的积极性。但是，这些年在宣传马列主义、毛泽东思想、自力更生、艰苦奋斗等方面做得不够，这是一个很大的教训。今后，一定要把科技领域中的改革、开放同坚持四项基本原则很好地结合起来。
    大家在发言中指出，几年来“短期行为”的错误主张，给我国的科技工作带来不良影响。北京大学教授唐有祺说，我们是一个有１１亿人口的大国，考虑问题、制定政策一定要从长远利益出发。近年来在教育、人口、资源开发等方面所表现出来的短期行为，都已造成难以挽回的损失。
    大家认为，科技成果商品化为科学技术迅速转化为生产力发挥了不可估量的作用。但是，社会上出现的一切“向钱看”的倾向，对科技界也有腐蚀，应该用四中全会精神总结这方面的经验教训。
    中国统配煤矿总公司副总经理范唯唐、中国预防医学科学院病毒研究所所长侯云德等指出，中国的科技现代化最终要靠我国的科技力量来完成。因此，建立一支思想和业务上都过得硬的科技队伍至关重要。要在科技战线上大力提倡爱国主义精神、献身精神、协作精神、艰苦奋斗的精神和全心全意为中国人民服务的精神。中国科学院最年轻的研究员、２９岁的袁亚湘很有感触地说：应该对青年科技人员进行国情教育，让大家在了解我国历史和现状的基础上，脚踏实地努力工作。他还特别强调要主要靠我们自己的力量，培养新一代高水平的科技人才。
    宋健等在会上讲了话。
