The head of the Chinese delegation, Li Daoyi, delivered a speech at the ministerial-level special meeting of the Group of 77 on June 23. He warmly praised the achievements of the Group of 77 over the past 25 years in advocating for the reform of unfair international economic relations and promoting economic cooperation among developing countries.

Li Daoyi pointed out that throughout the 1980s, the gap between the North and the South widened further, capital flows reversed, trade protectionism rose, and the heavy burden of debt made it difficult for developing countries to resume development. In the next decade, overcoming these difficulties, resuming the momentum of development, and creating a new situation will be a common task for all developing countries.

In the 1990s, the international community will hold a series of important meetings. In particular, at the initiative of the Group of 77, the United Nations will convene a special session in 1990 to discuss international economic cooperation, with a focus on revitalizing the development and growth of developing countries. We advocate that developing countries unite and urge developed countries to seriously participate in the economic special session, engage in a new round of South-North dialogue on a series of interrelated economic issues, and revitalize international economic cooperation to promote development.

Li Daoyi said, we firmly believe that in the face of the rapidly changing international situation, developing countries will welcome the new challenges of the 1990s with new strategies and new attitudes. This ministerial-level special meeting of the Group of 77 will be an important step in this direction, writing a new chapter in the mission entrusted to the Group of 77 by history.

Li Daoyi concluded by saying, the Chinese government has consistently pursued an independent and peaceful foreign policy, with one of the key points being to strengthen solidarity and cooperation with Third World countries. At the same time, the Chinese government adheres to the policy of reform and opening up. We will continue to engage in economic and technological cooperation with all countries, including developing countries, on the basis of equality and mutual benefit. We believe that as our construction progresses, cooperation between China and developing countries will achieve new breadth and depth. In the coming years, the Chinese government and people will continue to work with the Group of 77 to jointly strive for the reform of international economic relations and the revitalization of the development of developing countries.

　　我代表团长在七十七国集团特别会议上发言    
    继续加强同各国经济合作
    本报加拉加斯６月２４日电  记者朱满庭报道：在７７国集团部长级特别会议２３日的大会上，中国观察员代表团团长李道豫发表了讲话。他热烈赞扬７７国集团２５年来在要求改革不合理的国际经济关系、推进发展中国家的经济合作方面所取得的成绩。
    李道豫指出，在整个８０年代，南北差距进一步扩大，资金倒流，贸易保护主义上升和沉重的债务负担等种种不利条件，使发展中国家恢复发展的努力遇到重重障碍。在今后的１０年里，如何克服困难，恢复发展的势头，开创发展的新局面，是摆在我们广大发展中国家面前的共同任务。
    ９０年代国际社会将举行一系列重要的会议，尤其是在７７国集团倡议下，联合国将在１９９０年召开一次专门讨论国际经济合作并重点讨论重振发展中国家发展与增长的特别联大。我们主张广大发展中国家团结一致，呼吁和推动发达国家认真参加经济特别联大，就相互关联的一系列经济问题开展一轮新的南北对话，振兴促进发展的国际经济合作。
    李道豫说，我们坚信，面对急剧变化的国际形势，广大发展中国家将会以新的战略和新的姿态，迎接９０年代新的挑战。７７国集团这次部长级特别会议将成为朝着这个方向前进的重要一步，为７７国集团完成历史赋予的使命谱写新的篇章。
    李道豫最后说，中国政府过去和今后都坚持奉行独立自主的和平外交政策，其中一个基本点就是加强与第三世界国家的团结和合作。同时，我国政府坚持实行改革开放政策。我们将继续在平等互利的基础上，同世界各国包括发展中国家开展经济技术合作。我们相信，随着我国建设事业的发展，中国与广大发展中国家之间合作的广度和深度都将取得新的进展。在未来的年代里，中国政府和人民愿同７７国集团团结合作，继续为改革国际经济关系、重振发展中国家的发展而共同奋斗。
