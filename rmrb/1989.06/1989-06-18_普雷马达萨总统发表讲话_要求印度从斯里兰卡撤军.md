	President Premadasa delivered a speech
	Demanding the withdrawal of Indian troops from Sri Lanka
	Xinhua News Agency, Colombo, June 16 – President Premadasa of Sri Lanka tonight delivered a speech via the national television network, calling on all parties, groups, and individuals in Sri Lanka to unite and demand the withdrawal of the Indian Peacekeeping Forces from Sri Lankan territory.

	Premadasa stated that this action is necessary to smoothly achieve the goal of the withdrawal of Indian troops from Sri Lanka.

	Premadasa said, "The Indian Peacekeeping Forces must withdraw as soon as possible, and there is no room for debate on this point."

	On June 1, Premadasa had requested that Indian Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi withdraw all Indian soldiers from Sri Lanka by the end of July.

	According to an agreement signed between Sri Lanka and India in July 1987, India deployed 50,000 to 75,000 troops to Sri Lanka. The agreement required the Indian forces to disarm the Tamil armed groups opposing the Sri Lankan government and maintain peace in the eastern and northern regions of Sri Lanka. After Premadasa was elected president in December last year, he immediately demanded the withdrawal of Indian troops from Sri Lanka. So far, approximately 8,000 Indian troops have withdrawn from Sri Lanka.

　　普雷马达萨总统发表讲话
    要求印度从斯里兰卡撤军
    新华社科伦坡６月１６日电  斯里兰卡总统普雷马达萨今晚通过国家电视网发表讲话，号召斯里兰卡所有党派、团体和个人团结起来，要求印度维持和平部队从斯里兰卡领土上撤走。
    普雷马达萨说，这样做是为了顺利实现印度从斯里兰卡撤军的目标。
    普雷马达萨说：“印度维持和平部队必须尽快撤走，在这一点上没有什么可以争论的。”
    今年６月１日，普雷马达萨总统曾要求印度总理拉吉夫·甘地７月底以前从斯里兰卡撤走所有印度士兵。
    根据斯里兰卡和印度１９８７年７月签署的一项协议，印度向斯里兰卡派驻了５万至７．５万军队。协议要求印军解除斯里兰卡反政府的泰米尔人武装，维持斯里兰卡东部和北部的和平。普雷马达萨去年１２月当选总统后，立即要求印度从斯里兰卡撤军。到目前为止，约有８０００名印军撤出了斯里兰卡。
