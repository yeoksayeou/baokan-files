Daqing workers stick to their posts to increase production

	Daqing's 200,000 workers, with a high sense of political awareness, have been sticking to their posts and striving to increase production. They have made active contributions with practical actions to oppose and resist the turmoil and riots.

	In recent months, some people have been constantly coming to Daqing to link up and give speeches, inciting workers to stop work and production. However, Daqing workers have always stuck to their posts. They have also organized oil field patrol teams to maintain normal production order, and the oil field production has been stable and developing. In the first five months of this year, the entire oil field produced 23.032 million tons of crude oil, exceeding the plan by 1.13 million tons. The crude oil output has also seen a new increase since June.

	Recently, the cadres and workers of Daqing City have been seriously studying the speeches of Comrade Deng Xiaoping, carrying out the "double increase and double saving" activities in depth, striving to achieve the goal of increasing income by 150 million yuan this year and accumulating the production of 1 billion tons of crude oil to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Republic of China.
