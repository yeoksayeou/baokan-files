At a meeting held today for leading cadres in the industrial system of Beijing, Mayor Chen Xitong, on behalf of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China and the municipal government, delivered an important speech. He called on all workers in various sectors of the city to take immediate action to restore production, scientific research, teaching, and work order, and to recover the losses caused by the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

Chen Xitong said, forty years ago, the People's Liberation Army of China bravely marched into Beijing, with an overwhelming force that compelled the defending enemy to lay down their arms, and Beijing was peacefully liberated. Forty years later, today, the valiant and benevolent People's Liberation Army of China has once again saved Beijing from the counter-revolutionary rebellion, restoring peace and stability, allowing us to continue to adhere to the correct line established by the Third Plenary Session of the Eleventh Central Committee, to uphold the four cardinal principles, to adhere to reform and opening up, and to promote the socialist modernization of the capital.

After proposing that all attendees stand in silent tribute to the brave soldiers, armed police, and public security officers of the People's Liberation Army who sacrificed their lives in suppressing the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and expressing deep concern for the injured, Chen Xitong said, during the suppression of the rebellion, soldiers of the People's Liberation Army were brutally attacked by a group of rioters. In an unavoidable situation, they had to retaliate against the rioters, resulting in some civilians being mistakenly injured and even killed. This is something we do not want to see. Here, let us express our condolences and sympathy to the injured and deceased civilians.

Chen Xitong pointed out that this counter-revolutionary rebellion, which escalated from turmoil, aimed to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China, deny the socialist system, and subvert the People's Republic. Under the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, with the great assistance of all ethnic groups in the city, the martial law troops have bravely and resolutely crushed the counter-revolutionary rebellion. However, the planners and rioters of the rebellion are not willing to admit defeat and are still struggling desperately, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. They will not stop causing trouble; the struggle is far from over. With the gradual restoration of traffic order, the production, work, and living order disrupted by the counter-revolutionary rioters are beginning to return to normal, but they have not yet fully recovered. The brutal facts of the counter-revolutionary rebellion have educated the people, and their understanding of the nature of the counter-revolutionary rebellion and the correctness of the Party Central Committee's decision to suppress the rebellion has rapidly increased. They have expressed great indignation towards the counter-revolutionary rioters and great love for the People's Liberation Army. Numerous moving stories of the bond between the military and the people have emerged, and people's hearts are becoming more stable day by day. The counter-revolutionary rebellion is unpopular, and the enemy is bound to fail. This situation has been determined, and no one can change it.

Chen Xitong said that at present, the task facing the Party and government cadres at all levels in Beijing and all the people is to "grasp two things at once": on the one hand, to continue the struggle to suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion unyieldingly. To this end, four tasks need to be accomplished: first, to carry out extensive propaganda and education, fully expose the plots of the rioters, further publicize the correctness of the Central Committee's decision to suppress the rebellion, further raise the awareness of the people, and unite to fight against the rioters; second, to further develop and strengthen the organization of the masses to maintain order, mobilize the masses to take the initiative to protect factories, mines, shops, schools, and streets. Wherever the counter-revolutionary rioters engage in beating, smashing, looting, arson, and killing, they will be subjected to people's democratic dictatorship; third, to extensively carry out activities to support the military, and to do everything possible to assist the People's Liberation Army, armed police, and public security officers in completing the task of suppressing the rebellion; fourth, to extensively and deeply rely on and encourage the masses to expose and report, and to root out all the counter-revolutionary rioters hiding in every corner. We also warn those counter-revolutionary rioters that our policy is to be lenient to those who confess, strict to those who resist, to reward those who turn themselves in, and to reward those who perform meritorious deeds. The choice is yours. On the other hand, workers in industry, commerce, construction, scientific research, education, and government agencies should take immediate action to restore production, scientific research, teaching, and work order, and to recover the losses caused by the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Many contributions have been made by cadres and workers who have persevered in their posts and continued their work and production under extremely difficult conditions. We are deeply grateful for this, and we believe that they will continue to make greater contributions. For this, I, on behalf of the Municipal Committee and the Municipal Government, express my heartfelt thanks.

Chen Xitong pointed out that the political and economic losses caused by the counter-revolutionary rebellion are enormous. The evil purpose of a few counter-revolutionary plotters is to paralyze and reverse our socialist modernization construction, and to destroy the achievements of socialist construction and ten years of reform. However, under the correct leadership of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China and the State Council, we have the confidence, determination, ability, and means to definitely recover the losses caused by the counter-revolutionary rebellion. Finally, Chen Xitong called on all Communist Party members, Young Communist League members, and the general public to turn their righteous indignation and hatred towards the brutal counter-revolutionary rioters into strength, to defend the capital, and to make greater contributions to achieving a complete victory in the struggle against the counter-revolutionary rebellion.

　　把反革命暴乱造成的损失夺回来
    陈希同向北京市工业系统领导干部作重要讲话
    新华社北京６月１０日电  在今天举行的北京市工业系统领导干部会议上，陈希同市长代表中共北京市委和市政府作了重要讲话。他号召全市各行各业的职工立即行动起来，恢复生产、科研、教学、工作秩序，把反革命暴乱造成的损失夺回来。
    陈希同说，４０年前，中国人民解放军英勇挺进北平，以兵临城下、大军压境之势，迫使北平守敌放下武器，北平宣告和平解放。４０年后的今天，威武、仁义的中国人民解放军，又一次把北京从反革命暴乱中解救出来，还我们以安定团结的局面，使我们得以继续坚持党的十一届三中全会制订的正确路线，坚持四项基本原则，坚持改革开放，推动首都社会主义现代化建设胜利前进。解放军这两次丰功伟绩，将永远铭记在共和国和首都北京的史册上，铭记在广大人民群众的心中。
    陈希同在提议与会全体同志为在平息反革命暴乱而英勇牺牲的解放军指战员、武警官兵、公安干警肃立默哀和表示对受伤的同志以深切慰问之后说，在平定暴乱中，解放军战士遭到一批暴徒的残酷杀伤，在忍无可忍，迫不得已的情况下，对暴徒进行还击，有少数市民受到误伤，以至死亡，这是我们不愿意看到的。在此，让我们对误伤和死亡的人民群众表示慰问和哀悼。
    陈希同指出，这场由动乱恶性发展成的反革命暴乱，旨在推翻中国共产党的领导，否定社会主义制度，颠覆人民共和国，在中共中央、国务院、中央军委的正确领导下，在全市各族人民的大力协助下，目前戒严部队已经英勇、果敢地粉碎了反革命暴乱阴谋，但暴乱的策划者和暴徒们并不甘心失败，还在拚命挣扎，伺机反扑，他们决不会停止捣乱，斗争还远没有止息；随着交通秩序的逐步恢复，被反革命暴徒破坏的生产、工作、生活秩序开始趋向正常，但还没有完全恢复正常；活生生的凶残的反革命暴乱的事实，教育了人民群众，人们对反革命暴乱的性质和党中央平息暴乱的正确决策的认识迅速提高了，对反革命暴乱分子表示了极大的愤慨，对人民解放军表现了极大的热爱，军民鱼水情的动人事迹大量涌现，人心一天天更加稳定。反革命暴乱不得人心，敌人肯定失败这个大局已经定了，任何人也改变不了。
    陈希同说，当前，摆在北京市党政各级干部和全体人民面前的任务就是要“两手抓”：一方面，要把平息反革命暴乱的斗争坚定不移地继续进行下去，为此，要作好４项工作：一是要大力开展宣传教育工作，充分揭露暴乱分子的阴谋，进一步宣传中央平息暴乱决策的正确性，进一步提高人民群众的认识，起来同暴乱分子做斗争；二要进一步发展壮大群众维护秩序工作队的组织，发动群众自己起来搞好护厂、护矿、护店、护校、护街，反革命暴乱分子再在哪里搞打、砸、抢、烧、杀，就在哪里对他们实行人民民主专政；三要广泛开展拥军活动，尽一切可能协助人民解放军、武警、公安干警完成平息暴乱的任务；四是广泛深入地依靠和鼓励群众开展揭发检举，把潜藏在各个角落里的反革命暴乱分子统统挖出来。我们也正告那些反革命暴乱分子，我们的政策是坦白从宽，抗拒从严，将功折罪，立功受奖，何去何从由你们自己选择。另一方面，工业、商业、建筑业、科研、教学、机关等各行各业的职工立即行动起来，恢复生产、科研、教学、工作秩序，把反革命暴乱造成的损失夺回来。广大干部、职工在十分困难的情况下坚守岗位，坚持工作和生产，已经作出了许多贡献，我们深信一定将继续作出更大贡献，对此，我代表市委、市政府表示衷心的感谢。
    陈希同指出，反革命暴乱所造成的政治、经济损失是巨大的，极少数反革命阴谋策划者的罪恶目的就是要使我们的社会主义现代化建设事业瘫痪、倒退，使社会主义建设和１０年改革的成果毁于一旦。但是，在中共中央、国务院的正确领导下，我们有信心、有决心、有能力、有办法一定能把反革命暴乱造成的损失夺回来。最后，陈希同号召全体共产党员、共青团员和广大市民，要把对凶残的反革命暴乱分子的满腔义愤和仇恨转化为力量，为保卫首都，为夺取同反革命暴乱作斗争的彻底胜利作出更大的贡献。
