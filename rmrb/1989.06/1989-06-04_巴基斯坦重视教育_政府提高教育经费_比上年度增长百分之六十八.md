Pakistan Values Education: Government Increases Educational Funding by 68% Compared to Last Year

		Our reporter, Rényùjùn, reports from Islamabad on June 3: The Pakistani government has decided to increase the educational budget for the 1989-1990 fiscal year from 1.17 billion rupees last year to 1.97 billion rupees, a 68% increase.

		The Pakistani government announced the 1989-1990 fiscal year budget this afternoon. The budget states that 1.1 billion rupees of the educational budget will be used to develop primary education, especially in rural and minority areas, accounting for about two-thirds of the total educational budget. The government will also allocate special funds to emphasize technical training and staff advancement to improve the quality of the workforce.

		Today's announced government budget is the first budget released by the People's Party government after taking office. After Benazir Bhutto became Prime Minister, she repeatedly stated that her government would particularly focus on developing education and science and technology, reducing the illiteracy rate in Pakistan, creating conditions for rural and mountainous girls to attend school, and striving to achieve primary school graduation. This budget reflects Benazir Bhutto's advocacy.

　　巴基斯坦重视教育
    政府提高教育经费
    比上年度增长百分之六十八
    本报伊斯兰堡６月３日电  记者任毓骏报道：巴基斯坦政府决定在１９８９—１９９０财政年度把教育经费由上年度的１１．７亿卢比提高到１９．７亿卢比，提高率为６８％。
    巴基斯坦政府是在今天下午宣布１９８９—１９９０财政年度的预算的。预算指出，教育经费中将有１１亿卢比用于发展小学教育，特别是农村和少数民族地区的小学教育，约占整个教育经费的２／３。政府还将拨出专款重视技术培训和职工进修，以提高工作人员的素质。
    今天宣布的政府预算是人民党政府上台后推出的第一个预算。贝·布托就任总理后，曾多次表示，她的政府将特别重视发展教育和科学技术，降低巴基斯坦人口中的文盲率，创造条件让农村、山区的女童入学，争取达到小学毕业。这一预算体现了贝·布托的这一主张。
