The nuclear power stations currently under construction in Zhejiang's Qinshan and Guangdong's Dayawan have not been affected by the turmoil in Beijing and disturbances in some other places. All work is proceeding normally. Among the 318 foreign experts from France, Britain, the United States, and other countries working at the Dayawan Nuclear Power Station, along with their 173 families, not a single person or family has left the site. President Jiang Xinxiong of the China National Nuclear Corporation emphasized to a reporter from this newspaper that China's policy of actively and appropriately developing nuclear power remains unchanged; nuclear power will continue to be open to foreign cooperation and exchange; the goal of building 6 million kilowatts of nuclear power by the end of this century remains unchanged. According to the spirit of Deng Xiaoping's recent important speech, we also hope to develop more. The progress of the Dayawan and Qinshan nuclear power stations, which are already under construction, will not be affected. These two power stations will adhere to the principles of safety first and quality first and will be completed on schedule.

The Dayawan Nuclear Power Station, which is jointly invested in with Hong Kong, consists of two 900,000-kilowatt generating units. The first unit is scheduled to start generating electricity in October 1992, and the second unit is scheduled to start generating electricity nine months later. All equipment and designs for this large pressurized water reactor power station are provided and undertaken by foreign countries. The design and equipment supply for the nuclear island are the responsibility of France's Framatome Company; the design and equipment supply for the conventional island are the responsibility of Britain's General Electric Company; and the overall engineering services are the responsibility of France's Electricité de France. According to the plan, the containment building for the first unit's reactor will be topped off in September.

During the turmoil and disturbances in Beijing, the Dayawan Nuclear Power Station, located in Shenzhen, was also affected to some extent. However, due to the leadership of the Guangdong Nuclear Power Joint Venture Company's effective guidance and patient explanations, the situation in Dayawan remained stable. The 5,000 Chinese construction workers on the Dayawan site remained at their posts, and production continued as normal. Design drawings and all engineering construction proceeded on schedule. The more than 800 foreign experts and their wives and children did not leave. The coordination meeting scheduled for June 19 in Shenzhen with experts from China, France, Britain, and other countries, which was initially affected by the turmoil in Beijing, will now be held as planned. Currently, several dozen French and British nuclear power experts have obtained visas and will soon depart from their home countries to arrive in Shenzhen.

The Qinshan Nuclear Power Station completed 45% of its annual construction plan from January to May this year, making it the best period for the station's construction in the four years since it began. In terms of major projects, the first evaporator, manufactured by the Shanghai Boiler Factory, with a height of 17 meters, a diameter of nearly 4 meters, and a weight of 210 tons, was installed in place on May 2. Due to the serious disturbances in Shanghai, the delivery of the second evaporator was delayed by one week. The workers at the Qinshan Nuclear Power Station are striving to install it in place by early July as scheduled. According to the plan, the first phase of the Qinshan Nuclear Power Station's 300,000-kilowatt generating unit will be completed and start generating electricity by December next year. The negotiations for the second phase's 600,000-kilowatt unit's Sino-foreign cooperation have also not been affected by the domestic disturbances. The relevant negotiations will continue in June.

　　中国核工业总公司总经理强调
    核电对外开放合作交流不变
    秦山大亚湾电站将如期建成
    本报北京６月１６日讯  记者张何平报道：正在建设中的浙江秦山核电站和广东大亚湾核电站未受北京发生的暴乱和外地一些骚乱事件的影响，各项工作正常进行。在大亚湾核电站工作的来自法、英、美等国的３１８名专家和１７３户眷属，未有一人一户撤离现场。中国核工业总公司总经理蒋心雄向本报记者强调，中国积极、适当地发展核电的方针不变；核电对外开放、合作交流不变；本世纪内争取建成６００万千瓦核电站的总目标不变，根据邓小平同志最近重要讲话精神，我们还想争取多发展一点；已经在建的大亚湾和秦山核电站的进度不变。这两座核电站将坚持安全第一、质量第一的方针，如期建成。
    与香港合资，规模为两台９０万千瓦发电机组的大亚湾核电站，预定于１９９２年１０月第一台机组发电，９个月后第二台机组发电。这座大型压水堆核电站全部设备和设计均由国外提供和承担。其中，核岛设计和设备供应由法国法马通公司负责；常规岛设计和设备供应由英国通用电器公司负责；整个工程服务由法国电力公司负责。按预定计划，第一台机组的反应堆安全壳将于９月封顶。
    在北京动乱和暴乱期间，地处深圳的大亚湾核电站也一度受到波及，由于广东核电合营有限公司领导妥善疏导和耐心解释，大亚湾局势保持稳定，大亚湾工地５０００名中方建设者坚守岗位，生产秩序正常，图纸设计及各项工程建设如期进行。８００多位外国专家和他们的夫人及子女，未有一人撤离。原来一度担心的预定６月１９日在深圳召开的中、法、英等国专家的协调会，也未受北京暴乱的影响，将按期召开。目前，几十名法、英核电专家已拿到签证，即将从国内启程抵深。
    秦山核电站今年１至５月，已完成全年基建计划的４５％，为这座电站施工４年以来最好的时期。主要工程方面，由上海锅炉厂制造的第一台高１７米，直径近４米，重２１０吨的蒸发器，已于５月２日安装就位；由于上海发生的严重骚乱事件，第二台蒸发器交货比预期晚了一个星期，秦山核电站职工力争７月初如期安装就位。按照预定计划，秦山核电站第一期工程３０万千瓦发电机组将于明年１２月建成发电。二期工程中的６０万千瓦机组的中外合作谈判，也未受国内动乱的影响。有关商谈将于６月份继续进行。
