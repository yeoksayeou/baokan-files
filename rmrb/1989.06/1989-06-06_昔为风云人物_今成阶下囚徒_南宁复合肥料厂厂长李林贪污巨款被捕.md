Once a prominent figure in the enterprise reform, Li Lin, the director of the Nanning Compound Fertilizer Factory, was arrested for embezzling a huge sum of money. The Nanning Municipal People's Procuratorate recently swiftly cracked down on this case based on public reports, and the culprits, including Li Lin, have been arrested.

According to a responsible person from the Nanning Municipal Procuratorate, Li Lin and others embezzled a total of 480,000 yuan, which is the largest amount ever embezzled in Guangxi. From January 1988 to March of this year, Li Lin, along with Deputy Director Wu Chuan and Supply and Marketing Department Head Yan Songhua, colluded with Luo Rujun, the manager of Chengdu Dongcheng District Rongbei Trade Company. Luo falsely claimed to assist the Nanning Compound Fertilizer Factory in obtaining out-of-province certificates and arranging train cars, submitting fake receipts to the factory for reimbursement, thereby embezzling funds. The embezzled money totaled 480,000 yuan, with Luo Rujun receiving 370,000 yuan, Wang Bingguang 100,000 yuan, and the rest being divided among Li Lin, Wu Chuan, and Yan Songhua.

On May 5, after the procuratorial organ filed the case for investigation, 3,600 yuan in cash, 180 savings books and savings reward coupons worth 170,000 yuan, 3 color televisions, 2 refrigerators, and 1 VCR were seized from Li Lin's home. Currently, the case has recovered a total of 300,000 yuan in cash and savings books, 6 color televisions, 3 refrigerators, 3 VCRs, and 27 pieces of gold jewelry.
