Preventing Dangerous Military Activities
US and Soviet Union to Sign Agreement

According to a report by the Washington Post, after negotiations, the military representatives of the US and the Soviet Union have reached an agreement on a "Prevention of Dangerous Military Activities" pact, which will be signed next Monday. According to the agreement, in the event of accidental military encounters or incidents, the two countries will refrain from using force to prevent such accidental military activities from escalating into larger conflicts. The agreement stipulates that both sides will take measures to ensure that any incidents that may arise from dangerous military activities are resolved peacefully and promptly, without resorting to threats or the use of force. These military activities include the entry of military vessels and troops into border and tense areas, as well as communication jamming. It is said that the purpose of this agreement is, first, to prevent provocative military activities, and second, to prevent accidental incidents or misunderstandings from leading to military conflicts.
