Title: Warning to the US Government and Voice of America

This time, the turmoil and then the riot in Beijing, why did it receive such extraordinary support from the US government and Voice of America? To put it bluntly, it is because you have never given up on interfering in China's internal affairs and the delusion of changing China's color!

The great Chinese people, from their own painful experiences, know that without the Communist Party of China, there would be no New China. Only by building a socialist China with Chinese characteristics can there be an infinitely bright future. As for your US government, we have learned from the past and are now prepared: first, if you talk about friendly exchanges, we will also be friendly with you; if you want to do business with us, we are also willing to do business with you. According to the Five Principles of Peaceful Coexistence, equality and mutual benefit, fairness and reasonableness, it is beneficial to both sides and to world peace and development; second, if you interfere in China's internal affairs, or try to do some unscrupulous activities through exchanges and business, or even lead anti-China waves, apply pressure, etc., the Chinese government and people will never agree. The Chinese people have never been afraid of ghosts or superstitions. If the current US government is not forgetful, without going too far back, just from the past when the US government aided Chiang Kai-shek's Nationalist Party in the civil war, what role did you play after Japan's surrender and in the talks between the Communist Party and the Nationalists? What did your Hurley, Marshall, and Stuart do? What did your Dulles say and do? You invaded the Democratic People's Republic of Korea and brought the war to the Yalu River, bombing and shelling Chinese territory, did the great heroic Chinese people ever fear you? You imposed a 20-year economic blockade on the Chinese people, attempting to strangle the newly born New China—the People's Republic of China. Did the great heroic Chinese people ever fear you? You should know that the great heroic Chinese people were not afraid of ghosts or superstitions before they seized power. In the nearly 40 years since they stood up, they have created a great miracle recognized by the world, possessing a preliminary prosperity and strength and an eleven-billion-strong New China today. Will they now be afraid of ghosts, believe in superstitions, or yield to pressure? Do not dream your yellow dream again! It is better to put away your "old tricks" and look further ahead, do things more wisely!

However, some facts show that you are still not quite willing to give up. Previously, a few people in the US Congress openly interfered in China's internal affairs, talking nonsense about the Tibet issue. Now, the US government is openly supporting, raising, and sheltering traitors like Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian, and is fervently supporting the so-called "democracy movement" of Chinese youth students. In reality, it is a small number of people attempting to overthrow the Communist Party of China and the socialist system, and establish a completely American-style bourgeois republic. Don't you think you are reaching too far and doing things too blatantly? Don't you think that Voice of America has done so many unscrupulous things, spreading rumors and slander, playing a role in inciting trouble, and damaging the image of the great American people? Why don't you listen to the voice of the Chinese government, the voice of the People's Liberation Army of China, and the voice of the broad masses of the Chinese people? Why don't you look at the truth of the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing, look at what the Fang Lizhi, Li Shuxian, and their ilk, as well as the "High Autonomy Federation," "Workers' Autonomy Federation," and those illegal organizations and the thugs, riffraff, and criminals who looted, burned, and killed have done? You like to boast about American "democracy, freedom, and human rights." Do you allow the trampling of your American Constitution and laws, and the overthrow of the US government? Don't you know that in the 1950s, 1960s, and 1970s, you had student unrest and riots multiple times and each time you sent police and the military, and even air-dropped troops to suppress students and the people? You are truly suppressing students and the people. While we are suppressing counter-revolutionary riots, and to protect the people and students, our most beloved People's Liberation Army, the army of justice and righteousness, is willing to suffer great casualties and losses, but will never fire on the people and students. Have you seen such heroic and tragic behavior in America? Why don't you look at how many people from all walks of life and the masses of the people are shown on Chinese television every day, bringing food and drink to comfort the soldiers, and angrily denouncing the heinous crimes of the counter-revolutionary rioters? Yes, you are unwilling to face the facts and would rather make policies according to the rumors of Voice of America. How sad and regrettable! What qualifications do you have to criticize us? Your Voice of America is still chattering away, creating all kinds of shocking lies, deceiving yourself and others. Anyone with a bit of common sense and reason, who will believe your rumors and slander? The truth will eventually be revealed, and the rumor-mongers and those who believe in rumors will only end up lifting a stone to drop it on their own feet.

As for Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian, I think for your sake and for the long-term interests of the people of China and the United States, it is better for you to be wise and quickly hand over these two traitors of the Chinese people to the Chinese government. Otherwise, you will only become more passive and foolish by carrying this burden.

Here, I would like to remind the US government that the broad masses of the Chinese people are firmly standing with the Communist Party of China and the Chinese government. The Chinese government has the ability to stop the turmoil, suppress the riot, stabilize the situation, and exercise its functions normally. Comrade Deng Xiaoping recently pointed out that China's line, principles, and policies will not only not change but will also be more stable, better, and even faster in the future. The Chinese government will continue to adhere to an independent and peaceful foreign policy. Currently, more and more countries and peoples are issuing statements supporting the Chinese government in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riot and are willing to continue to cooperate with us in friendship. I hope the US government will be more calm, wise, and far-sighted, and consider the long-term interests of the people of China and the United States!

　　正告美国政府和美国之音
    中国公民、研究馆员  王明哲
    这次在北京发生的先是动乱后是暴乱，为什么得到了美国政府和美国之音那样异乎寻常的支持？说穿了就是你们从来没有放弃干涉中国内政和妄图改变中国颜色的梦想！
    伟大的中国人民，从自己痛苦的经历中深知，没有中国共产党就没有新中国，只有建设有中国特色的社会主义中国才有无限光明的前途。对于你们美国政府，我们过去领教过，现在也有思想准备：一是你讲友好交往，我们也同你们友好交往，你愿意同我们做生意，我们也愿意同你们做生意，按照和平共处五项原则，平等互惠、公平合理，于双方、于世界和平和发展都有好处；二是你要干涉中国内政，或是想通过交往和做生意搞什么不光彩的活动，甚至带头煽起反华浪潮，想施加什么压力等等，中国政府和中国人民绝不答应。中国人民从来就是不怕鬼、不信邪的。如果美国现政府不健忘的话，远的不说，就从过去美国政府援助蒋介石国民党打内战算起，你们在日本投降后以及在国共和谈中扮演了什么角色？你们的赫尔利、马歇尔、司徒雷登究竟干了些什么勾当？你们的杜勒斯又说过些什么、做过些什么？你们侵略朝鲜民主主义人民共和国并把战火烧到鸭绿江边，狂轰滥炸中国的领土，伟大英雄的中国人民害怕过吗？你们对中国人民实行了２０多年的经济封锁，妄图扼杀刚刚诞生的新中国——中华人民共和国，伟大英雄的中国人民害怕过吗？你们应该知道，伟大英雄的中国人民在没有取得政权以前都不怕鬼、不信邪，在已经站起来将近４０年，创造了举世公认的伟大奇迹，具有初步繁荣强大的国力和拥有十一亿人口的今天的新中国，难道反而会怕什么鬼，信什么邪，屈服于什么压力吗？请不要再做你们的黄粱美梦吧！还是收起你们的“老一套”，把眼光放远一点，把事情做得明智一点为好！伟大的社会主义中华人民共和国政府和伟大英雄的中国人民，永远不会吃你们的“老一套”！
    可是一些事实说明，你们还是不大甘心，前者美国议会里的少数人曾公然干涉中国内政，在西藏问题上说三道四。现在美国政府又公然支持、豢养、庇护什么方励之、李淑娴等中华民族的败类，公然狂热的支持什么中国青年学生争取所谓“民主运动”，实际是极少数人妄图打倒中国共产党，推翻社会主义制度，建立完全美国式的资产阶级共和国。你们不觉得把手伸得太长、把事情做得太露骨了吗？你们不觉得美国之音干了那么多不光彩的造谣中伤、起了推波助澜的煽动作用，有损于伟大美国人民的形象吗？你们为什么不听一听中国政府的声音，中国人民解放军的声音，中国广大人民群众的声音？你们为什么不看一看北京反革命暴乱的真相，看一看你们那么起劲赞扬和支持的方励之、李淑娴之流以及“高自联”、“工自联”等非法组织和那些打砸抢烧杀的暴徒、社会渣滓们干了何等野蛮、凶残、骇人听闻、惨不忍睹的罪恶勾当？你们喜欢标榜什么美国的“民主、自由、人权”，难道你们容许践踏你们美国的宪法和法律，推翻美国政府吗？难道你们在５０年代、６０年代和７０年代不是多次发生过学潮和骚乱并且每次都出动警察和军队，甚至出动空降部队去镇压过学生和人民吗？你们是名副其实地镇压学生和人民。而我们则是平息反革命暴乱，并且为了保护人民群众和青年学生，我们最可爱的中国人民解放军正义之师、仁义之师，甘愿使自己遭受巨大的伤亡和损失，而决不向人民群众和青年学生开枪。你们在美国见到过这样慷慨悲壮的英雄行为吗？你们怎么不看看中国的电视台每天播放多少各界人士和人民群众“箪食壶浆”以慰王师，并愤怒控诉反革命暴徒滔天罪行的真实记录呢？是的，你们根本不愿意正视事实，而宁肯按照美国之音的谣言制定政策，多么可悲可叹！你们有什么资格批评我们？你们的美国之音直到目前还在喋喋不休地制造各种耸人听闻的谎言，自欺欺人。稍有常识和理智的人，谁会听信你们蛊惑人心的谣言中伤？真相终究会大白于天下，谣言者和信谣者，最后只能搬起石头砸自己的脚。
    说到方励之、李淑娴之流，我看为你们着想，也为中美两国人民的长远利益着想，你们还是放明智一点好，请你们还是赶快把方李这两个中国人民的败类交给中国政府是上策！否则你们把这个包袱背起来，只能越背越被动、越愚蠢。
    在这里我想提醒美国政府，广大中国人民是坚决站在中国共产党和中国政府一边的。中国政府完全有能力制止动乱、平息暴乱、稳定大局、正常行使职权。邓小平同志最近明确指出，中国的路线、方针和政策不仅不会改变，而且今后还会搞的更稳、更好、甚至更快。中国政府将继续坚持独立自主的和平外交政策，目前，越来越多的国家和人民纷纷发表声明支持中国政府平息反革命暴乱，并愿意继续同我们友好合作下去。我希望美国政府还是冷静一点、明智一点、把眼光放远一点，以中美两国人民长远利益的大局为重更好些！
