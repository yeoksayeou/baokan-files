Marshal Xu Xiangqian and Marshal Nie Rongzhen have inscribed their calligraphic works for the soon-to-be-published book "The Military Work of the Contemporary Chinese Army."

Marshal Xu Xiangqian's inscription reads: "Carry forward the glorious tradition and strive for greater achievements." Marshal Nie Rongzhen's inscription reads: "Learn from historical experiences and strengthen the modernization of our army."

The 1 million-word book "The Military Work of the Contemporary Chinese Army" is one of the four comprehensive volumes in the "Contemporary China" series on national defense and military affairs. For the first time, it systematically records the development process, major achievements, and lessons learned from the military work of the People's Liberation Army since the founding of New China.

In the preface written by Yang Dezhi, it is pointed out that to enhance the combat effectiveness of the army, it is necessary to strengthen scientific research and develop modern weapons and equipment; it is necessary to unswervingly take military training as the center of the work of the troops, and conduct training from a strict, difficult, and practical perspective based on real combat; it is necessary to adhere to Mao Zedong's military thought and strengthen the strategic exploration of national defense and army development.
