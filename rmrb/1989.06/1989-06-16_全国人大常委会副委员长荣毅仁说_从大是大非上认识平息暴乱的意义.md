Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress and Chairman of the China International Trust and Investment Corporation (CITIC) Rong Yiren recently said at a joint meeting of the CITIC Party Committee and administrative leadership: "The Party and the government's swift suppression of the riots was a very wise and correct decision."

Rong Yiren pointed out that this is a matter of major principles, concerning the defense of the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the socialist system, and major issues of the People's Republic of China. It is necessary to recognize the great significance of suppressing the riots from the perspective of major principles.

At the meeting held on June 12, he said that everyone should organize and study thoroughly, combining the characteristics of the company, and think carefully. Sometimes, emotional issues and rational analysis differ, and one should consider more from a rational perspective. Without the leadership of the Communist Party, there would be no reform and opening up, and our country would have no hope. The country, the company, and individuals are all the same.

He demanded the following: First, on matters of major principles, one must be clear-cut and firmly support the decisions of the Party Central Committee, the State Council, and the Central Military Commission, without any ambiguity; second, work must be done thoroughly and meticulously, and problems must be analyzed calmly and rationally. He pointed out that one should start from the desire for unity, unite people, help people, and educate people. Only in this way can the truly bad elements be genuinely isolated.

    从大是大非上认识平息暴乱的意义
    新华社北京６月１５日电  全国人大常委会副委员长、中国国际信托投资公司董事长荣毅仁，日前在中信公司党委常委和行政领导联席会议上说：“这次党和政府迅速平息暴乱，是非常英明正确的决策。”
    荣毅仁指出，要认识这是个大是大非问题，关系到捍卫中国共产党的领导、社会主义制度、中华人民共和国的大事。要从大是大非上去认识这次平息暴乱的重大意义。
    他在６月１２日举行的这次会议上说，要好好组织学习，要结合公司的特点，大家认真思考一下。有的时候，感情问题和理智的分析是会不同的，要多从理智上来考虑。没有共产党的领导就没有改革开放，我们国家就没有希望，国家、公司、个人都是这样。
    他要求：一是在大是大非问题上，一定要旗帜鲜明，坚决拥护党中央、国务院、中央军委的决策，不能含糊；二是做工作要深入细致，冷静、理智地分析问题。他指出，要从团结的愿望出发，团结人、帮助人、教育人，这样才能把极少数坏人真正孤立起来。
