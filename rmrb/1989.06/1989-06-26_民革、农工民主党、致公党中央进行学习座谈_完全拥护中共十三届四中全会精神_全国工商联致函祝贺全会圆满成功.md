Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 26th.

The Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang held a meeting of chairpersons today. The chairman of the Central Committee, Zhu Xuefan, presided over the meeting. The meeting studied and discussed the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, unanimously supporting the session's organizational handling of Zhao Ziyang's errors in the anti-party, anti-socialist turmoil, and unanimously supporting Jiang Zemin's assumption of the position of General Secretary of the CCP Central Committee. The meeting expressed heartfelt support and full trust in the new leadership core of the CCP Central Committee after the adjustment.

The meeting fully agreed with the session's high evaluation of the significant role played by the older generation of proletarian revolutionaries, with Deng Xiaoping as their representative, in this struggle; the session's high evaluation of the great contributions made by the People's Liberation Army, the People's Armed Police, and public security officers in suppressing the counter-revolutionary riots in the capital.

The meeting fully agreed with the session's proposal to focus on four major tasks at present, believing that these are in line with the hearts of the Party and the people. The meeting demanded that all levels of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang and all party members should seriously study the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the CCP and Deng Xiaoping's important speech, understand the situation, raise awareness, unify thoughts, boost spirits, adhere to "one center, two basic points," and more closely unite around the Communist Party of China. Responding to the session's call, we will carry forward the glorious tradition of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang working together with the Communist Party of China through thick and thin, sharing honor and disgrace, and contribute all our strength to further stabilizing the national situation, promoting the rectification and opening up, strengthening ideological and political work, opposing bourgeois liberalization, punishing corruption, and building a clean government.

Vice Chairpersons of the Central Committee of the Revolutionary Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, Zheng Dongguo, Hou Jingru, Peng Qingyuan, and Li Ganliu, and Chairman of the Central Discipline Inspection Commission, Sun Yueqi, attended the meeting.

The Central Committee of the China Democratic League held an expanded meeting of the central chairpersons in Beijing today to seriously study and discuss the communiqué of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the CCP. The attendees unanimously agreed that the decisions made at this session are completely in line with the hearts of the Party, the people, and all members of the China Democratic League, expressing unanimous support.

The attendees resolutely supported the session's decision to adjust some members of the CCP Central Committee's leadership, and resolutely supported the new leadership core of the CCP Central Committee.

The attendees said in their speeches that the line, principles, and policies formulated at the Third Plenary Session of the 11th Central Committee are completely correct, and the basic line of "one center, two basic points" determined at the 13th National Congress of the CCP is completely correct. We must firmly and unwaveringly implement and execute them.

The attendees especially emphasized that the Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the state and also the foundation of our China Democratic League. Adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles is something that every member of the China Democratic League must never forget. In the future, we must conduct in-depth education among all members of the China Democratic League on adhering to the Four Cardinal Principles.

The attendees believed that adhering to reform and opening up is the path to strengthening the country and is the common wish of the people across the country. We, the members of the China Democratic League, must actively respond to the call of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the CCP, remain confident, boost spirits, and under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, strive to accomplish the various tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session.

The Central Committee of the China Zhi Gong Party held a meeting of the central standing committee members and central committee members in Beijing today to study the documents of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the CCP. The attendees believed that the Fourth Plenary Session is a very important session in the history of the development of the Communist Party of China. The session once again proved with unshakable unity that the Communist Party of China is indeed a great party and is indeed the leadership core of all the people of China. The attendees fully supported Li Peng's report on behalf of the Political Bureau at the Fourth Plenary Session, and believed that Zhao Ziyang's error of supporting the turmoil and splitting the Party is extremely serious in nature and consequences, supporting the session's decision to remove his Party positions; supporting the session's decision to elect Jiang Zemin as the General Secretary of the CCP Central Committee and to adjust some members of the Central Committee's leadership.

The meeting believed that the China Zhi Gong Party is one of the democratic parties led by the Communist Party of China. The China Zhi Gong Party will, as always, closely unite around the CCP Central Committee, and with the Communist Party of China, share joys and sorrows, and unite, connect with overseas Chinese and their relatives, and continue to adhere to the Four Cardinal Principles, the foundation of the state, and firmly walk the path of reform and opening up, the path to strengthening the country. At present, we must especially strive to implement and assist the Party and the government in focusing on the four major tasks proposed by the Fourth Plenary Session.

The All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce sent a letter to the CCP Central Committee today, warmly congratulating the successful conclusion of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee of the CCP.

The letter from the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce said that the Federation fully agrees with the session's analysis of the national political situation in the past two months, believing that the Party Central Committee's major decisions and series of measures at the critical moment are necessary, timely, and correct; fully supports the session's handling of Zhao Ziyang's errors and the decision to remove his positions, as well as other personnel adjustments; resolutely supports the new leadership core of the CCP Central Committee produced by the session and Jiang Zemin's assumption of the position of General Secretary of the CCP Central Committee, believing that the Communist Party of China, after this serious political struggle, is truly representative of the interests of all the people, is strong and powerful, and is worthy of being a great party; the Federation fully agrees with the session's judgment that the Four Cardinal Principles are the foundation of the state and that reform and opening up is the path to strengthening the country.

The letter expressed resolute response to the call of the Fourth Plenary Session of the 13th Central Committee, to further unite the broad membership, seriously study Deng Xiaoping's important speech during his reception of senior military officers of the capital's martial law troops and related documents, strengthen ideological and political work, raise awareness, and unify thoughts; to seriously participate in various economic construction undertakings at their respective posts, promote the smooth progress of the tasks of stabilizing the economy, rectification, and deepening reform, and develop a stable and united political situation; to give full play to the Federation's advantages in connecting with the business community in Hong Kong, Macao, Taiwan, and overseas, and strengthen exchanges and cooperation in economic and technological aspects and trade.
