The adjustment of the political system has always been an important aspect of China's ongoing reforms, and this includes the adjustment of the government. However, the adjustment of the government is not limited to changes in government institutions and functions. In a more practical sense, the adjustment of the government primarily involves the adjustment of its power structure.

Two Different Power Structures in Transition

Under the traditional highly centralized system, the government, as the owner of assets, was the organizer and manager of all economic activities, directly organizing and commanding economic activities. Based on its role as the owner of assets, the government held the power to make production decisions, appoint and dismiss personnel, allocate materials, and distribute funds. Clearly, these powers reflect the government's control over the elements and processes of production activities, which is consistent with its role as the owner of assets and is necessary for the government as the organizer and manager of economic activities. Without these powers, the government would be unable to organize economic activities or effectively control them. However, tightly controlling the elements of economic activities such as materials, funds, and personnel within the layers of government and allocating and distributing them according to administrative organizational principles and administrative subordination systems is a major reason for the rigidity and lack of vitality in economic activities.

China's reforms aim to break away from the situation where politics and economics are combined, and government and enterprises are not separated. For enterprises, this means breaking free from the control of various levels of administrative organs, entering the market, and becoming market participants—commodity producers. For the government, this means withdrawing from specific economic activities, no longer appearing as an economic activity subject, but as a public power organization supervising economic exchanges between the two parties in the economic field and maintaining the basic order of economic activities. Accompanying the changes in the government's role and status, there must be an adjustment in the government's power structure. For a government that maintains public order, traditional powers lose their necessity with the abolition of the old system, and correspondingly, new powers are needed that are suitable for the government's new role and status.

Under the system of separation of government and enterprise, the government's main function is to exercise supervision, including the approval and licensing of certain activities, inspection and supervision of production and business activities, and punishment and enforcement against those who fail to fulfill legal obligations and disrupt public order. Obviously, these powers are indispensable for a government that exercises supervisory functions and maintains public order. Therefore, a government that performs supervisory functions should have the power to approve and license, inspect and investigate, punish, and enforce. To this end, the government's powers must be adjusted and allocated, eliminating, weakening, or de-emphasizing those powers that are unnecessary or do not meet the requirements of the new system and new functions, and increasing or strengthening those powers that meet the requirements of the new system and new functions. This forms the adjustment and change of the government's power structure during the reform process, transitioning from the old power structure to the new.

Contradictions in the Transition of Government Power Structure

With the progress of the reform, China's government's old and new power structures are in the process of transition. Some powers that are suitable for the old system are gradually shrinking in scope, such as mandatory planning, material allocation, and fund distribution. At the same time, some powers that the old system did not have are gradually being grasped by the government, such as inspection and investigation powers, and punitive powers. However, the transition of the government's old and new powers is not coordinated, especially for some powers that are required by the new system and necessary for administrative organs to perform supervisory functions, such as the power to seal up and freeze deposits, which are still not possessed by administrative organs. As a result, administrative organs generally feel that it is difficult to inspect, handle, and enforce decisions, making it difficult to effectively perform supervisory functions.

The reasons for the above situation are mainly twofold: (1) We lack sufficient understanding of the adjustment of the government's power structure during the reform. In recent years, the reform has mainly focused on the enterprise side, but in fact, the system reform should first be a reform of the government. Reforming the government is not just a matter of "delegating power" but a matter of adjusting the power structure. The abandonment of old powers must be accompanied by the acquisition of new powers, and the acquisition of new powers must be based on the internal requirements of the new system. For the complex issues involved in the adjustment of the power structure, it can be said that we still lack a deep understanding and comprehensive recognition. (2) There is a lack of clear understanding of the nature of new powers. The adjustment of the government's power structure is not just a matter of quantity but also a matter of quality. Accompanying the government's transition from the organizer of economic activities to the maintainer of public order, the government's powers should also transition from administrative organizational powers within the system to public powers outside the system. Because in the system where politics and economics are combined, the government is the superior of enterprises and exercises powers according to administrative organizational principles; in the system where politics and economics are separated, the government and enterprises are independent subjects, and the government exercises public powers as the maintainer of public order. The nature of power is different, and the requirements are also different. Traditional powers based on administrative organizational relationships require enterprises to be submissive, while public powers based on the relationship between two different subjects require enterprises to be submissive but not absolutely submissive, but to act according to legal norms. Because enterprises have their own interests, and public powers may infringe on the interests of enterprises.

Due to the above two reasons, the current government power structure in China has become somewhat chaotic, even contradictory and conflicting. On the one hand, the powers that administrative organs should have are not yet obtained, and administrative organs lack the necessary powers to perform supervisory functions; on the other hand, there is a lack of necessary restraints on the powers already granted to administrative organs, leading to frequent occurrences of illegal, derelict, and abusive practices. These two aspects intertwine, forming a vicious cycle: the lack of necessary powers makes it difficult for administrative organs to manage effectively; to perform supervisory functions, administrative organs have to resort to some illegal or unreasonable means, but the use of illegal or unreasonable means inevitably brings about some negative consequences, leading to more cautious authorization, and the inability to adapt to the needs of system changes in a timely manner to grant the necessary powers to administrative organs. Thus, the adjustment of the government power structure is likely to fall into contradictions or paradoxes.

Rules for the Adjustment of Government Power Structure

Timely adjustment of the government's powers is a difficult problem that China's system reform must constantly pay attention to and solve. To get the government power structure adjustment out of contradictions and paradoxes, the following rules should be followed:

1. Powers that administrative organs should have must be granted, and powers that administrative organs need to perform new functions should be fully granted. This is the first rule for adjusting the government's power structure during the reform.

To adapt to the requirements of a socialist commodity economy, the government's functions should shift from direct organization and command to indirect supervision and control. Powers such as inspection, handling, and enforcement are necessary for the government to perform supervisory functions and maintain public order. Because the supervisory function is based on the separation of government and enterprise, administrative organs do not have enterprises directly subordinate to them, nor do they have the means to allocate and control the personnel, funds, and materials of enterprises. Instead, they control the activities of enterprises through indirect supervision. To perform supervisory functions and maintain public order, first, it is necessary to inspect the production and business activities of enterprises to see if they comply with the standards set by the state and if there are factors that harm or have adverse effects on public interests or public order. Second, there must be a certain handling power. That is, administrative commands such as prohibitions can be issued for certain improper activities, and administrative penalties can be given to lawbreakers, etc. Administrative organs must have the power to handle the situations they have learned about. Finally, there must be the power to enforce the state's administrative order. The purpose of performing supervisory functions is to ensure the state of the administrative order required by the state, and the occurrence of illegal or improper activities in the administrative process is a disruption of the administrative order. For this, administrative organs need the ability to restore the disrupted order or state, that is, the power of enforcement. Once such a situation occurs, administrative organs can take coercive measures to prompt the managed party or the administrative organs themselves to restore the required state.

The above powers are the complete powers needed for the government to perform supervisory functions. Since we require administrative departments to assume supervisory responsibilities, we should grant them the necessary powers to perform supervisory responsibilities; since our reform has determined that administrative organs should shift from direct organization to indirect control, we should grant them the complete powers to achieve indirect control.

2. Any authorization must be accompanied by control; without control, there can be no authorization. This should be the second rule for adjusting the government's power structure.

Granting the powers that should be granted is only one aspect of adjusting the government's power structure. It is especially worth noting that: power is a force that can compel others to obey. It not only means breaking the balance of power division among various state organs but also means that it may cause some damage to the rights and interests of citizens and enterprises. This is perhaps the important reason why we have been reluctant to clearly grant the powers that administrative organs should have. In fact, the key issue is not whether administrative organs should be granted the necessary powers, but that after granting powers, corresponding measures must be taken to control the powers, so that the powers are exercised within reasonable limits and in a proper manner. Therefore, corresponding to the rule of "powers that should be granted must be granted" for power adjustment is: any granted power must be limited, and without limitation, there is no authorization. Authorization and control must be carried out simultaneously, and consideration of control must be given at the same time as the granting of powers. Without establishing control, there can be no authorization. The control of powers includes clearly defining what powers are granted, the scope of authority, the conditions and procedures for the exercise of powers, and the legal responsibilities that must be borne for illegal, derelict, and abusive practices, etc. The law must make clear provisions for these, so that the granted powers are exercised within a controllable range.

Controlling power is one of the essences of modern democratic politics. In modern society, administrative power is constantly expanding, but with this comes the need for stricter and more perfect institutional controls on administrative power. The growth of power and the control of power are inseparable. For a long time, China has not controlled power, leading to many problems in the construction of the past 30-plus years, and even the "Ten Years of Catastrophe" that is difficult to recall. Therefore, it is necessary to emphasize the control of power. This is especially important in the current system transition. We must establish a new system on a new basis and also establish a new government power structure on the basis of controlling power.

From the above, it can be seen that only when the above two rules are coordinated and complementary can China's government power structure adjustment enter a virtuous cycle and thus smoothly complete the system transition.

　　政府权力结构调整及其规则
　　张树义
    政治体制改革始终是我国当前这场改革所不能忽视的重要内容，而政治体制改革包括政府的调整，但政府的调整绝不仅仅限于对政府机构、职能等的调整。从更实在的意义上说，政府的调整主要是权力结构的调整。
    　　　　两种不同权力结构的转换
    在传统的高度集中体制下，政企合一、政经合一，政府是以资产所有者的身份、处于全部经济活动的组织者和管理者的地位，直接对经济活动进行组织和指挥。基于资产所有者的身份，政府掌握着经济活动中的生产决定权、人事任免权、物资调拨权、资金分配权等。很明显，这些权力体现了政府对生产活动的要素和流程进行控制的特征，是与政府作为资产所有者的身份相适应的，是政府作为经济活动的组织者和管理者所必需的。没有这些权力便无法对经济活动进行组织，也无法实现对经济活动的有效控制。但是，将作为经济活动要素的物资、资金以及人员等牢牢控制在层层隶属的政府手中，按行政组织原则、行政隶属系统分配、调拨，正是经济活动僵化、缺乏活力的重要原因。
    我国的改革就是要破除政经合一，政企不分的状况。实行政府和企业分开，对于企业来说，意味着摆脱各级行政机构的控制，走入市场，成为市场活动的主体——商品生产者；对于政府来说，意味着退出具体经济活动的领域，不再以经济活动主体的身份出现，而是以公共权力组织的身份对经济领域中双方当事人的经济交往进行监督，维持经济活动的基本秩序。伴随着政府身份、地位的变化，必然是政府权力结构的调整。对于公共秩序维持者的政府来说，传统的权力随着旧体制的革除而失去存在的必要，相应的，需要的是适应政府新的身份、地位的新的权力结构。
    在政企分离的体制下，政府的主要职能是实行监督，包括对从事某项活动的批准许可、对生产、经营活动的检查、监督、对不履行法定义务、破坏公共秩序者的处罚与强制执行等。显然，这些权力对行使监督职能、维持公共秩序的政府来说是不可缺少的。因此，履行监督职能的政府应当享有批准许可权，检查、调查权，处罚权，强制执行权等。为此，必须对政府权力进行调整和配置，取消、削弱或淡化那些不必要或不适应新体制、新职能要求的权力，增加或强化那些适应新体制、新职能要求的权力，由此形成改革过程中政府权力结构的调整与变化，从旧的权力结构向新的权力结构的转换。
    　　　　政府权力结构转换中的矛盾
    随着改革的进展，我国政府的新旧权力结构也处于交替之中。一些适应旧体制需要的权力正在缩小、减少，如指令性计划、物资调拨，资金分配等权力都在逐步缩小作用范围。同时，一些为旧体制所不曾有过的权力已逐步为政府所掌握，如检查、调查权，处罚权等，但是，政府新旧权力的交替并不协调，尤其是某些为新体制所需求的，行政机关履行监督职能所必需的权力，如查封权，冻结存款权等仍不为行政机关所掌握，以致行政机关普遍感到检查难、处理难，对处理决定的执行更难，不能有效地履行监督职能。
    上述状况的出现，原因主要有两方面：（１）我们对改革中政府权力结构调整缺乏足够的认识。近年来的改革主要偏重于企业方面，但实际上，体制改革首先应当是对政府的改革。而对政府进行改革就绝不是一个简单“放权”的问题，而是一个权力结构的调整问题。旧的权力的放弃必须以新的权力的获得为前提条件或同时进行，而获得新的权力必须根据新体制内在的要求。对于权力结构调整所涉及的复杂问题，可以说，我们仍然缺少深刻的理解及全面的认识。（２）对新的权力的性质缺少清醒的认识。政府权力结构的调整绝不仅仅是数量上的增减，而是有着质的变化。伴随着政府从经济活动的组织者的身份转为公共秩序的维持者身份，政府权力也应从行政系统内部的组织权转变为对外部的公共权力。因为在政企合一的体制下，政府是作为企业的上级，按行政组织原则行使权力；而在政企分开的体制下，政府和企业是互不隶属的主体，政府是作为公共秩序的维持者而行使公共权力。权力的性质不同，要求自然也不同。基于行政组织关系的传统权力，企业必须且也只能是服从，而基于两个不同主体关系的公共权力，则企业必须服从，但不是绝对服从，而是按法律规范行事。因为企业存在着自己的利益，而公共权力有可能侵害企业的利益。
    由于上述两方面的原因，目前我国政府权力结构出现了某种混乱，甚至矛盾和冲突。一方面是行政机关应当享有的权力还未取得，行政机关缺少履行监督职能的必要权力；另一方面是对已授予行政机关的权力缺少必要的制约，导致违法、渎职，滥用职权的现象经常出现。这两方面互相交错，形成一种恶性循环：缺少必要的权力，行政机关便无法进行有效的管理；为了履行监督职能，行政机关不得不动用一些非法或不尽合理的手段，但非法或不尽合理的手段的采用必然带来一些不良的后果，从而导致授权的更为谨慎，不能适应体制变化的需要及时将所需之权授予行政机关。于是，政府权力结构的调整就难免陷入矛盾或悖论之中。
    　　　　政府权力结构调整的规则
    适时地对政府权力进行调整，是我国体制改革要时常注意，并加以解决的难题。政府权力结构调整走出矛盾与悖论的境地，应当遵循以下规则：
    １、凡是行政机关应该享有的权力就必须授予，凡是行政机关履行新职能所需要的权力就应当完整地授予。这是改革中对政府权力结构进行调整的第一项规则。
    适应社会主义商品经济的要求，政府的职能应从直接的组织和指挥转变为间接的监督和控制。类似于检查权、处理权、强制执行权等权力都是政府履行监督职能、维持公共秩序的必要权力。因为监督职能是基于政企分开，行政机关既没有直接隶属于己的企业，更没有掌握对企业人、财、物的分配、控制手段，而是通过间接的监督对企业的活动进行必要的控制。履行监督职能，维持公共秩序，首先，需要对企业的生产、经营情况进行检查，看其是否符合国家所规定的标准，是否存在对公共利益或公共秩序构成危害或带来不利影响的因素。其次，要有一定的处理权。即对于某些不正当活动下达禁止等行政命令，对于违法者给予行政处罚等。行政机关必须有权对所了解的情况分别作出处理。最后，要有实现国家行政秩序所要求的状态的强制执行权。履行监督职能的目的就是要保证国家行政秩序所要求的状态，行政过程中违法或不当活动的出现是对行政秩序的一种破坏，对此，行政机关需要具有恢复被破坏的秩序或状态的能力，即强制执行权。一旦出现上述状况，行政机关可以采取强制措施，促使被管理者或由行政机关自己恢复所要求的状态。
    上述权力是政府履行监督职能所需要的完整的权力。既然我们要求行政部门承担监督职责，那么就应赋予其履行监督职责的必要权力；既然我们的改革已确定行政机关从直接的组织转变为间接的控制，那么就应赋予其实现间接控制的完整的权力。
    ２、凡授权必须有控制，没有控制就不能授权。这应当是政府权力结构调整的第二项规则。
    授予应授之权只是政府权力结构调整的一个方面。特别需要指出的是：权力毕竟是一种可以强制他人服从的力量。它不仅意味着将打破国家各机关之间权力分工方面的平衡，而且意味着可能会对公民、企业的权益造成某种损害。这恐怕正是我们对行政机关应享有的权力迟迟不予明确授予的重要原因。但实际上，问题的关键并不在于是否应该授予行政机关以必要的权力，而在于授予权力之后，必须采取相应的措施对权力加以控制，使权力在合理的界限内正当行使。因此，与“应该享有的权力就必须授予”这一权力调整的规则相对应的是：凡授予的权力必须有限制，没有限制就没有授权。授权与控制必须同步进行，授予权力的同时就应考虑控制，不设立控制就不能授权。对权力进行限制包括明确授予何种权力，权限范围，权力行使的条件和程序，违法、渎职、滥用职权应当承担的法律责任等内容，法律必须对此作出明确规定，使授予的权力在可控的范围内行使。
    控制权力是现代民主政治的精髓之一。现代社会行政权力呈不断扩大的趋势，但与此相伴而随的是对行政权力的控制应更加严格、制度更为完善。权力的增长与权力的控制是不可分割的。我国长期以来对权力不讲控制，导致３０多年建设的诸多弊端，甚至出现了“十年浩劫”这种不堪回首的悲剧。因此，必须强调对权力的控制。这一点在当前体制转换中尤为重要。我们要在新的基础上建立新的体制，也要在控权的基础上建立新的政府权力结构。
    由上可见，只有上述两项规则互相配合、互为补充，我国政府权力结构调整才能进入良性循环，并进而顺利完成体制的转换。
