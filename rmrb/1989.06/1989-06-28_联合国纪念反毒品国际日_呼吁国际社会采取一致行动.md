United Nations Marks International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking

	Call for International Community to Take Unified Action

	United Nations, June 26 (Xinhua) — United Nations Secretary-General Javier Pérez de Cuéllar today called on the international community to take unified action to combat drug trafficking.

	In a message to the "Second International Day Against Drug Abuse and Illicit Trafficking" commemoration meeting, the Secretary-General said that the drug problem is one of the most destructive threats currently facing the world.

	He noted in his message that after four years of unremitting efforts, the international community agreed last December to sign an anti-drug trafficking convention. He said this was a major political breakthrough, demonstrating the resolve of governments worldwide to cooperate in the fight against drug traffickers.

	He urged countries that have not yet ratified this convention to take swift action to join the ranks of those fighting against drugs.

　　联合国纪念反毒品国际日    
    呼吁国际社会采取一致行动
    新华社联合国６月２６日电  联合国秘书长佩雷斯·德奎利亚尔今天呼吁国际社会采取一致行动与毒品走私作斗争。
    秘书长在致“第二届反吸毒反贩毒国际日”纪念集会的信中说，毒品问题是目前世界面临的最具破坏性威胁的问题之一。
    他在信中指出，经过４年不懈的努力，国际社会已经于去年１２月同意签署一项反毒品走私公约。他说，这是一项重大的政治突破，表明各国政府一致合作打击毒品贩子的决心。
    他要求还未批准这项公约的国家应尽快采取行动加入到反毒品的行列中来。
