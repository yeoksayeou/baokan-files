Employees of some Singaporean companies are gradually returning to China to resume work.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Singapore on June 17, the Singapore Trade Development Board issued a statement on June 17 saying that during the peak of the recent turmoil in China, some employees of Singaporean companies who had withdrawn from China have begun to return and resume work.

The statement said that after recent meetings with major Singaporean companies that have investments and trade ties in China, the Trade Development Board learned that none of them have changed their investment commitments to China. Many companies have decided to resume their operations in China.

The statement said that according to reports from the Singapore Trade Offices in Beijing and Shanghai, business in these two cities has returned to normal.

According to a report by a Singaporean newspaper today, Singapore's First Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defense, Goh Chok Tong, who is currently on a friendly visit to Japan, said in an interview with the Japanese newspaper Asahi Shimbun on June 15 that despite the recent turmoil in Beijing, Singapore will continue to strengthen its economic ties with China.
