Pay Attention to Protecting Farmers' Interests
Cui Xueming

Recent years of practice have made us realize that paying close attention to protecting farmers' interests and production enthusiasm is the key to ensuring the steady development of the rural economy.

Our county, Qixia in Shandong, is a mountainous agricultural county. The state of agricultural economy has a significant impact on the entire county's economy. In 1984, driven by the motive to accelerate the development of the rural economy, the county mandated that every village must establish industry under the slogan of "eliminating villages without industry." As a result, village-run industries sprang up and within a short time, half of them closed down, causing severe economic losses in many villages, with some burdened with heavy economic debts. Learning from this lesson, our county has, in recent years of rural work, paid great attention to starting from the actual situation of each village and respecting public opinion.

Firstly, we seriously listen to and address the suggestions and voices from the farmers. In 1983, most villages in this county had their collective orchards leased at low prices to a few individuals, which caused dissatisfaction among the majority of farmers who frequently petitioned and filed complaints. The county committee and government understood the situation and, in 1986, worked hard to improve the leasing of orchards. Farmers' grievances were alleviated, and their management of the orchards significantly improved. In 1987, the fruit production reached 1.4 billion kilograms. Last year, despite being a lean year, the fruit production reached 2 billion kilograms, ranking first in the province.

Secondly, for initiatives promoted from above, we allow each village to adapt according to local conditions without imposing a one-size-fits-all approach. In 1987, there was a push from above to implement large-scale land management. However, through investigations, it was found that the vast majority of farmers were opposed and hoped that the household contract responsibility system would remain unchanged for the long term. Therefore, while introducing relevant experiences of large-scale land management, the county warned the leaders of each township and village to implement it only where conditions allowed. Currently, 99% of the villages in the county have stabilized the household contract responsibility system, and farmers' investment in land has increased year by year.

　　注意保护农民的利益
    崔学明
    近几年的实践，使我们认识到，十分注意保护农民的利益和生产积极性，是保证农村经济稳步发展的关键。
    我们山东栖霞县是一个山区农业县，农业经济状况如何，对全县经济影响很大。１９８４年，出于加快农村经济发展的动机，在“消灭无工村”的口号影响下，县里曾硬性规定村村必须办工业，结果村办工业一哄而起，不长时间就倒闭了一半，致使不少农村经济损失严重，有的背上了沉重的经济债务。吸取这一教训，我们县在近几年的农村工作中十分注意从本村的实际情况出发，尊重民意。
    首先，对来自农民群众的有关建议和呼声能认真听取，该解决的坚决解决。１９８３年，这个县的大多数村的集体果园，均在事前串通好的情况下低价承包给了少数人，大多数农民有意见，纷纷上访告状。县委县政府了解下情，于１９８６年下功夫完善果园承包。农民顺了气，对果园的管理比过去明显增强。１９８７年，水果产量达到１．４亿公斤。去年，尽管是小年，但水果产量达２亿公斤，名列全省第一。
    其次，对上面提倡的事情，允许各村因地制宜，不搞一刀切。１９８７年，上面提倡搞土地规模经营。但通过调查，绝大多数农民不同意，希望家庭联产承包责任制长期不变。因此，县里在介绍有关土地规模经营经验的同时，告诫各乡镇、各村领导，有条件的地方才搞土地规模经营。现在，全县９９％的村稳定家庭联产承包责任制，农民向土地的投入逐年增多。
