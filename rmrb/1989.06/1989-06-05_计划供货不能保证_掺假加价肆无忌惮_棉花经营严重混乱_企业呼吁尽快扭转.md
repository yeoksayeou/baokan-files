Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 5th.

	Supply shortages and price gouging are rampant in the cotton industry, causing significant chaos. Enterprises are urgently calling for swift action to rectify the situation.

	Investigations reveal that the current cotton supply faces four major issues:

		— Cotton distributors are exploiting the tight supply to arbitrarily raise prices. According to some cotton textile enterprises, except for Xinjiang, all cotton-producing provinces are using various excuses such as "packaging fees" and "price differences" to demand extra money from enterprises. Each ton of cotton is marked up by more than 10 yuan, with some provinces marking up by as much as 22 yuan per ton.

		— Inflated grades and adulteration are common. A reporter visited a cotton textile mill and found that cotton labeled as first-grade actually differed by two grades after factory inspection. One mill director said that it is rare to find cotton where the grade matches the label. It is normal for grades and fiber length to be inflated by one or two grades, and cases of inflation by three or four grades are also common. Additionally, issues like underweight, mixing in bricks and stones, and mixing different grades in one package are frequently encountered.

		Someone estimated that currently, cotton mills are paying an extra 60 to 70 yuan per ton beyond the state-regulated price, increasing costs and leading to losses for many large cotton mills.

		— Failure to deliver according to contracts. According to a city's textile department, the state-allocated cotton distribution plan for the first four months of this year has seen some provinces delivering nothing by the end of April, while others have only delivered a fraction of the planned 220,000 tons, leaving many cotton mills to rely on processing raw materials and reducing speeds to maintain production.

		— Despite the State Council's notice prohibiting advance payments, cotton mills cannot obtain cotton without making advance payments. It is understood that the cotton procurement department uses one hand to borrow from local agricultural banks to purchase cotton and the other hand to collect advance payments from cotton mills, effectively using two loans from the bank to buy cotton.

	Many cotton mill directors told reporters that they can only endure these issues without raising objections, otherwise, cotton supply will be immediately halted, and the mills will have to shut down. They eagerly hope that relevant departments will take measures to address the problems in cotton supply.

　　计划供货不能保证　掺假加价肆无忌惮
    棉花经营严重混乱　企业呼吁尽快扭转
    新华社北京６月５日电  （记者王坚、夏俊生）记者在调查中发现，当前棉花供给中不能按计划供货和掺杂使假、乱加价等现象普遍存在，棉纺企业苦不堪言、苦不敢言。厂长们迫切希望有关部门采取措施尽快改变棉花经营中的混乱状况。
    据了解，在棉花供货中目前突出存在四大问题：
    ——棉花经销单位趁紧俏之机随意加价。据一些棉纺企业反映，除新疆以外，各产棉省均以“包装费”、“平议棉差价”等多种名义向企业多要钱，每担棉花加价１０元以上，有的省一担棉花加价２２元。
    ——虚抬等级，掺杂使假。记者在一家棉纺厂看到，产地来的棉花标明是一级品，但经工厂检验，实际品级却与标牌相差２个等级。一位棉纺厂厂长说，现在品级名实相符的棉花很少见，等级和棉花纤维长度虚高一二个等级算正常，虚高三四个等级也随处可见。另外，缺斤短两、内掺砖块和石头以及好几个品级混包的现象也常见。
    有人估算，现在棉纺厂购入每担棉花实际上要比国家规定价格多付六七十元，使许多大棉纺厂成本增加，出现亏损。
    ——不按合同供货。据某市纺织部门反映，国家下达的今年头４个月的棉花调拨计划，有的省到４月底连一担也没完成，有的省２２万担的计划只给了３万多担，使不少棉纺厂只得靠来料加工、降低车速来维持不停产。
    ——尽管国务院通知不准预付款，但棉纺厂不预付款就拿不到棉花。据了解，棉花收购部门一手从当地农业银行贷款收购棉花，一手又向棉纺厂收预付款，这等于银行拿出两笔贷款收棉花。
    许多棉纺企业的厂长对记者说，对棉花供货中的这些问题，他们只能忍气吞声而不能提出异议，否则，马上停供棉花，工厂就得“歇摊”。他们热切希望有关部门采取措施，解决棉花供货中的问题。
