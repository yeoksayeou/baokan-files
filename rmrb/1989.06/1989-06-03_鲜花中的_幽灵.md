While you are captivated by the colorful and fragrant flowers, be cautious of the "ghost" hidden within them! Many common flowers contain toxic substances. Every year, approximately 20,000 elderly people and children worldwide are harmed by toxic flowers.

The oleander has vibrant red flowers that are pleasing to the eye and has a long blooming period, making it easy to cultivate. It is suitable for both garden planting and potted arrangements. However, the leaves, bark, and fruits of the oleander contain a highly toxic organic compound called oleandrin. If ingested, it can cause poisoning and even death. Recent reports from abroad indicate that American experts have discovered that oleander can pollute the air and cause respiratory and digestive system cancers.

The elegant dracaena has a liquid in its branches and leaves that causes severe itching when it comes into contact with the skin. The vibrant poinsettia has white sap in its stems and leaves that can cause skin redness and swelling. Ingesting its stems and leaves can lead to poisoning and even death. The elegant daffodil, valued for its ornamental and medicinal properties, is widely loved. However, it has recently been discovered that its bulbs contain a toxic substance called lycorine, which can cause vomiting and diarrhea if ingested. The beautiful mimosa contains mimosine, a highly toxic organic compound. Excessive contact with it can cause hair loss. The strong scent of jasmine can make people feel nauseous and cause discomfort for those with high blood pressure and heart disease. The jasmine plant, when placed indoors, can cause asthma, restlessness, memory loss, and excitement from the fragrance of orchids and lilies. The pine and cypress plants produce pine resin, which can affect appetite. Some spiky palm plants can cause allergic reactions in sensitive individuals. Additionally, plants like devil's ivy, coralberry, water hyacinth, turtleback fern, five-colored meadowsweet, and stone lily all contain different toxic substances. Therefore, when planting flowers in the garden or placing them on balconies and indoors, it is important to be familiar with the nature and effects of the flowers. Even for flowers with less toxic substances, they should not be touched indiscriminately to prevent toxins from entering the mouth, eyes, or nose and causing poisoning.

    鲜花中的“幽灵”
    当你陶醉于多彩多姿、芳香扑鼻的鲜花中时，可要小心提防鲜花中的“幽灵”！因为，常见的花卉中有100多种含有毒物质，全世界每年大约有2万多老人和儿童受到有毒花卉伤害。
    夹竹桃花朵鲜红，逗人喜爱，并且花期较长又容易种植，不仅适用于庭院栽培，又可盆栽。但在夹竹桃的叶、皮和果实中，均含有一种叫夹竹桃苷的剧毒有机物质，误入口中，可致人中毒，甚至死亡。近据国外报道，美国专家发现夹竹桃会污染空气，并证实可引起呼吸道和消化系统的癌症。
    清雅的万年青，其枝叶中的液体接触人体后，可使皮肤奇痒难忍；艳丽的一品红，其茎叶中白色乳汁会使人的皮肤红肿，误食其茎叶后还会引起中毒，甚至“命归西天”；素雅的水仙花，具有观赏和药用价值，广为人们所爱。但最近发现，其鳞茎内也含有一种叫
  “拉可丁”的有毒物质，一旦误食，能引起呕吐、腹泻等症；美丽动人的含羞草，其内的含羞草碱是一种毒性很强的有机物，人体过多的接触后会使毛发脱落；夜来香的香味虽浓，但易使人感到恶心，并使患有高血压和心脏病的人感到憋闷；玉丁香常放置在室内会引起气喘、心烦意乱、记忆衰退；兰花和百合花的香味，会使人过度兴奋；松柏类的花卉，因产生松香可影响人的食欲；一些带刺的掌类植物，对某些体质过敏者则会产生“过敏反应”；此外，虎刺、冬珊瑚、马蹄莲、龟背竹、五色梅以及石蒜等花草都含有不同的有毒物质。所以在庭院种植和在阳台、室内放置花卉时，要熟悉花卉的性质和作用，对某些毒性不太大的花卉，也不能随意去触摸，以防毒素误入口、眼、鼻而发生中毒事故。
