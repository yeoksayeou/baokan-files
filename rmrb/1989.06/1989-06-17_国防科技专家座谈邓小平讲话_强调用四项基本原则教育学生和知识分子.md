Defense Science and Technology Experts Discuss Deng Xiaoping's Speech
Emphasize Educating Students and Intellectuals with the Four Cardinal Principles

BEIJING, June 17 (Xinhua) - The State Council for National Defense Science and Technology today organized a meeting of renowned defense science and technology experts to study and discuss the important speech by Chairman Deng Xiaoping of the Central Military Commission. The experts shared their personal experiences and the history of China's defense science and technology industry to express their views, believing that only by adhering to one central task and two fundamental points can China's intellectuals have a bright future, and science and technology can continue to develop.

Notable experts who have made outstanding contributions to the development of defense science and technology, including Qian Xuesen, Wang Ganchang, Zhu Guangya, Chen Nengkuan, Gu Zengfen, Wang Dafang, Wang Shiguang, Yang Chuanquan, Zhuang Fenggan, and You Ziping, attended the meeting.

The experts agreed that Deng Xiaoping's analysis of the causes of the counter-revolutionary rebellion from both the international and domestic perspectives is highly insightful and correct. They noted that China's domestic environment has been significantly influenced by the lack of resistance to bourgeois liberalization over a long period. The four cardinal principles have not been effectively used to educate the people, students, and intellectuals. Currently, young people around 20 years old are deeply influenced by both domestic and international bourgeois liberalization. These middle-aged and elderly intellectuals should bravely step forward to do the work of guiding young intellectuals and students, resolutely criticizing the liberalization thoughts within our ranks. The experts expressed their condemnation and disgust towards Fang Lizhi and Li Shuxian's treacherous actions of seeking refuge in foreign embassies and plotting to overthrow the socialist system.

When discussing the recent events where many in the academic and scientific communities took to the streets to support the students' sit-ins, the experts believed that it is necessary to correct misunderstandings and unify thoughts based on Deng Xiaoping's speech. This will ensure that China's science and technology industries can develop more steadily and smoothly during the period of reform and opening up, and that China's intellectuals can have a bright future.

The meeting was presided over by Ding Henggao, Director of the State Council for National Defense Science and Technology, and Ying Yongning, Political Commissar. They accompanied the experts to visit the martial law troops.

　　国防科技专家座谈邓小平讲话
    强调用四项基本原则教育学生和知识分子
    本报北京６月１７日讯  国防科工委今天组织著名国防科技专家学习座谈中央军委邓小平主席重要讲话。专家们以自已的切身经历和我国国防科技工业的发展历史谈体会，认为只有坚持一个中心、两个基本点，中国的知识分子才有光明前途，科学技术才能不断发展。
    为发展国防科技事业作出卓越贡献的钱学森、王淦昌、朱光亚、陈能宽、顾诵芬、王大珩、王士光、杨楚泉、庄逢甘、尤子平等２７位专家出席座谈会。
    专家们认为，邓小平同志从国际大气候和中国自己的小气候两方面分析了反革命暴乱产生的原因，是非常英明正确的。专家们谈到，中国自己的小气候，主要是较长时期以来，我们对资产阶级自由化思潮抵制不力，没有把四项基本原则作为基本思想来教育人民、教育学生、教育知识分子。现在２０岁左右的青年受国内外资产阶级自由化影响较深，我们这些中、老年知识分子应该勇敢地站出来，做青年知识分子的工作，做青年学生的工作，毫不犹豫地批评我们队伍中的自由化思想。对于方励之、李淑娴投靠外国驻华使馆、阴谋颠覆社会主义制度的罪恶行径，专家们表示了声讨和唾弃。
    在谈到前一段知识界、科技界许多人一度上街声援学生静坐时，专家们认为，现在需要在邓小平讲话的基础上扭转认识、统一思想，保证我国科技工业在改革开放中得到更稳、更好的发展，保证中国的知识分子有一个光明的前途。
    国防科工委主任丁衡高、政委邢永宁主持了座谈会并陪同专家们看望了戒严部队。
