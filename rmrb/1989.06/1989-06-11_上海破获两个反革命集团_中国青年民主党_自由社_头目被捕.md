Shanghai Public Security Bureau on June 10 busted the counter-revolutionary groups "Chinese Youth Democratic Party" and "Free Society." The leaders of these two counter-revolutionary groups, including Wong Cheng-ming, have been captured.

According to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau, individual clothing vendor Wong Cheng-ming had been plotting to organize a counter-revolutionary group since 1986. He wrote a so-called "general outline," proposing the "ultimate goal: to overthrow the leadership of the Communist Party of China." Wong Cheng-ming appointed himself as the "general secretary" and repeatedly advocated that "the Communist Party of China is no longer effective, China must establish an opposition party," and threatened that the leaders of the Communist Party and the government should "step down."

Taking advantage of the turmoil that began in April this year, Wong Cheng-ming and his accomplices frequently engaged in activities, planning to recruit members from universities such as Fudan and Tongji, and arranging to urgently produce seals for the "Chinese Youth Democratic Party," printing the "general outline," "party member registration forms," and other reactionary propaganda materials. They also decided to send people to other regions to recruit members. On May 17, Wong Cheng-ming and his accomplices joined the student parade, inciting trouble. This group also displayed a banner reading "Shanghai Citizens' Support Group," parading through the streets. Wong Cheng-ming and his accomplices also frequently visited various universities to incite unrest.

The Shanghai Public Security Bureau also pointed out that the ringleader of the counter-revolutionary group "Free Society," Li Zhi-guo, has been actively organizing since March this year. He has been visiting various universities and public places such as the new railway station to post "society formation" notices. He sent "condolence letters" to students in various regions who were involved in the turmoil, inciting them to "fight the corrupt government to the end." In the "Free Society" charter, he proposed establishing a "Great Free Kingdom," "establishing armed forces, bases, and headquarters," and made seals for the "Free Society." He also formulated so-called "national flag, national emblem, national flower, national name, national currency," and other items.

　　上海破获两个反革命集团
    “中国青年民主党”“自由社”头目被捕
    新华社上海６月１１日电  上海市公安机关６月１０日破获反革命集团“中国青年民主党”和“自由社”。这两个反革命集团的头头翁正明等人已捕获。
    据上海公安机关介绍，个体服装户翁正明早在１９８６年就策划组织反革命集团，书写了所谓“总纲”，提出“最高目标：推翻中国共产党的领导”。翁正明自封为“总书记”，多次鼓吹“现在中国共产党不行了，中国必须成立一个反对党”，并叫嚣要中国共产党和政府领导人“下台”。
    翁正明等人乘今年４月开始的学潮之机，四出频繁活动，策划到复旦、同济等大学发展成员，布置抓紧刻制“中国青年民主党”印章，印制“总纲”、“党员登记表”和其他反动宣传品，并决定派人去外地发展成员。５月１７日，翁正明等人混入大学生游行队伍，鼓动闹事。这伙人还打出“上海市民声援团”的横幅，招摇过市。翁正明等人还多次到一些大学串联，进行煽动。
    上海公安机关还指出，预谋组织反革命集团“自由社”的为首分子李治国，今年３月以来，四处串联，先后在一些大学和铁路新客站等公共场所张贴“结社”启事，向各地闹事学生投寄“慰问信”，鼓动学生“同腐败政府斗争到底”。他在“自由社”章程中提出建立“大自由王国”、“建立武装、根据地、大本营”，刻制了“自由社”图章，制定了所谓“国旗、国徽、国花、国名、国币”等。
