The Communist Party of Fujian Province has decided to make the punishment of corruption a key part of rectifying the Party's organizations and purifying the Party's ranks.

This decision was made at the conclusion of the Fourth Plenum of the Tenth Session of the Fujian Provincial Party Committee on June 28. The Fujian Provincial Party Committee requires that all Party and government leadership organs focus on the following tasks in punishing corruption: investigating and rectifying issues where leading cadres and their family members have engaged in business or established enterprises in violation of regulations; seriously investigating and prosecuting major cases of using power for personal gain and bribery, and making the results public; cracking down on the illegal occupation of land for the construction of private homes; investigating and rectifying issues where family members of leading cadres have traveled abroad in violation of regulations; and severely cracking down on serious criminal offenses, economic crimes, and various social evils.

The decision emphasizes that these issues should start with county-level and above cadres, who are required to self-report within a specified period. The public is also encouraged to report any issues. Regardless of who is involved, any problems that arise must be thoroughly investigated and handled.

In terms of reform and opening up, the Fujian Provincial Party Committee has decided to seriously address the issues of the 1,200 already operational "three-resource" enterprises, genuinely helping them solve problems in production and operations, and ensuring the safety and legal rights of foreign-invested enterprises. It will continue to develop special economic zones and areas for Taiwanese investment, further improve the investment environment, strengthen legislation, improve efficiency, provide high-quality services, accelerate the development of basic industries and infrastructure such as steel, petroleum, and chemicals, and continue to upgrade the Xiamen and Fuzhou airports and expand the Dongdu and Mazu ports, making it convenient and beneficial for investors. It will actively prepare for the September 1989 Xiamen International Investment and Trade Fair to expand economic and technological cooperation with overseas entities. Effective measures will be taken to continue to expand exports and ensure the sustained growth of foreign trade exports.
