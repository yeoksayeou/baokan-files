Residents in the Military Museum area assisted in clearing barricades, and martial law troops bravely repelled armed thugs. The Martial Law Command Center reported: At around 6:30 PM on June 6th, a group of thugs hiding in an unfinished building fired at soldiers and officers of a certain martial law unit who were clearing barricades and burned tanks and armored vehicles near the Military Museum in Beijing. The martial law troops immediately retaliated. Local residents strongly supported the troops' just actions. Seeing that the troops' loudspeaker batteries were running low, they eagerly provided new batteries and sent bread and cigarettes to the troops as gifts. The residents said, "Those who shoot at the troops deserve to be retaliated against!" With the support of the residents, the martial law troops quickly repelled the thugs, who fled in disarray. Some residents told the troops, "Your bullets flew into the residential buildings." The soldiers explained, "Our guns are aimed at a small group of thugs, not at you, not at the people of the capital. We will never fire at the people." The mood of some residents who were initially frightened rose, and they helped the troops clear the barricades, restoring traffic flow in the area. The residents enthusiastically shouted, "Firmly support the People's Liberation Army!" Many residents excitedly embraced the soldiers, presenting a moving scene of military-civilian unity.

    新华社北京６月７日电  戒严指挥部消息：６月６日下午６时３０分左右，一伙歹徒躲在一栋未完工的大楼上向在北京复兴路军事博物馆一带清除路障和被烧毁的坦克、装甲车的某戒严部队指战员开枪，戒严部队立即还击。当地居民对戒严部队的正义行动非常支持，见部队喊话的话筒电池电力不足，争着送来新电池，并给部队送来面包和香烟等慰问品，居民们说：“对向部队放黑枪的歹徒，就是应该还击！”在居民支持下，戒严部队很快将歹徒击退，歹徒仓惶逃跑。有一部分居民对部队的同志说，你们打枪，有的子弹飞到了居民楼上。部队官兵向他们宣传：“我们的枪是对着一小撮歹徒的，绝不是对准你们的，不是对准首都人民的。我们绝不会向人民开枪。”一些原来有害怕心理的群众的情绪高涨起来，帮助部队清理路障，使这一带的交通疏导开了。群众高兴地呼喊：坚决支持解放军！许多群众兴奋地与解放军官兵拥抱，呈现出军民一家的动人情景。
