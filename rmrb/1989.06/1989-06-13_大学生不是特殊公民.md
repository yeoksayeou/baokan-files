A recent graduate from Peking University wrote a letter to relevant authorities. The content of the letter is as follows:

The turmoil that began with the student movement has escalated into a counter-revolutionary rebellion, resulting in hundreds to thousands of casualties and causing billions of yuan in damage to state property. I am deeply grieved.

As a graduate from Peking University a few years back, I would like to say a few words to society. I believe that the political awareness of some college students today is very poor, yet they are arrogant and do as they please. The public is too indulgent of them, and the Party and government are too lenient and accommodating, even turning a blind eye to their lawbreaking, which has allowed the turmoil to escalate.

The biggest mistake the Party and government have made in recent years is not paying enough attention to education, particularly neglecting the political and ideological education of college students. This includes education on communist ideals, the Four Cardinal Principles, organizational discipline, and moral character. As a result, many college students have been corrupted and captured by bourgeois liberalization, becoming the successors of the bourgeoisie.

Many college students have not systematically studied Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, but they uncritically accept bourgeois theories. Many of them do not understand the arduous and tortuous process of establishing the People's Republic, nor do they understand why New China can only take the socialist path. Therefore, they lack deep feelings for the Party and the people's government. They have not experienced the ten years of turmoil and do not cherish the hard-won stability and unity. My classmates and I were the first batch to enter university after the restoration of the national college entrance examination system proposed by Comrade Deng Xiaoping following the end of the ten years of turmoil. Therefore, we cherish the opportunity to study and have a sense of gratitude towards the Party and the government. During the 35th anniversary national day parade, college students sincerely held up banners saying "Comrade Xiaoping, you are good." This fully illustrates this point. However, some current college students now curse and attack our country's chief architect of reform and opening up, Comrade Deng Xiaoping, which is incomprehensible. In recent years, many college students have had little contact with labor and the working class, and do not understand that it is their peers, the young soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, who have used their blood and lives to defend the motherland, allowing them to study in a peaceful environment; nor do they understand that it is their peers, the young workers and farmers, who have created a large amount of material wealth with their hard work and sweat, allowing them to study for free. Compared to these peers, our college students have contributed very little to society and have no reason to be arrogant, let alone act as if they are the new saviors. Our impoverished motherland is like a big family, where older brothers and sisters support their younger siblings to study, and the younger siblings naturally should cherish the opportunity to study.

Judging a person is not about listening to their words, but observing their actions. Judging the nature of this student movement should not be based solely on the slogans they shouted or the flags they waved, but rather on their actions and the consequences they caused. The criterion for testing truth can only be social practice.

I believe that since the beginning of this student movement, a very small number of students have used despicable means for ulterior motives. These people have deceived and utilized a large number of college students and misled public opinion. They are hypocritical, saying one thing and doing another, and from the beginning, they have placed themselves in opposition to the Party and the government, even attempting to rise above the Party and the government and become special citizens. They do not listen to the Party and government leaders' sincere advice, and even use threatening language, saying things like, "If this condition is not met, we will go on strike and parade; if that condition is not met, we will sit-in and go on a hunger strike." They abstractly affirm the Party's leadership while concretely denying it. In their speeches, the people's government led by the Party is a dictatorial, incompetent, and corrupt government, and the main leaders of the Party and the state are all bad people who all need to be overthrown. Where is the shadow of "supporting the Communist Party"? They broadcast the Voice of America every day with loudspeakers in the campus and Tiananmen Square, erecting a so-called Chinese version of the Statue of Liberty, disrupting major national events of global significance, and inciting strikes and work stoppages everywhere, as if they were afraid that the country would not be in chaos. How can this be called "patriotism"? On the one hand, they constantly go to many news agencies to make trouble, shouting "the news must tell the truth," and on the other hand, they manufacture a large number of shocking rumors every day on the main streets' power poles and Tiananmen Square's loudspeakers. On the one hand, they say the government does not value education, and on the other hand, they not only do not attend classes themselves but also incite elementary and middle school students to go on strike. On the one hand, they say they want to "maintain the dignity of the constitution" and "rule of law, not rule of man," and on the other hand, they establish illegal organizations, engage in illegal parades, and lead the way in storming Zhongnanhai in late April, constantly engaging in unconstitutional incitement. Not to mention that in Beijing, they led the way in violating urban and traffic regulations, carrying people on bicycles, throwing away garbage, and turning the sacred and solemn Tiananmen Square into a stinking pile of garbage. After the martial law was declared, they thought they could act lawlessly as long as they claimed to be "patriotic" and ignored the martial law, continuing to parade and demonstrate, posting slogans, and spreading rumors. Some people actively participated in the counter-revolutionary rebellion of blocking military vehicles and beating PLA soldiers. Even today, some students still refuse to return to class, travel around to incite strikes and work stoppages, and even threaten to launch a larger so-called "patriotic democratic movement," with their reactionary arrogance being very rampant.

I believe that the government has been too indulgent with these college students, and the public opinion has been too flattering of them in the past period, to the extent that these college students have become untouchable social masters and special citizens above the law, with no laws, regulations, or rules being able to control them. Even thugs, thieves, and robbers have claimed to be college students.

Reflecting on this, I hope that every college student and citizen with a conscience will reflect on this issue. I urge that in the eyes of the law, everyone is equal, and college students cannot become special citizens. No one can use the excuse of "patriotism is not a crime" to do as they please. Illegal organizations should be disbanded immediately upon establishment, illegal parades should be stopped immediately upon taking to the streets, and those who violate criminal laws should be held criminally responsible. College students who violate the law should be punished the same as civilians. Those who violate the law and commit crimes should not be punished only "after the autumn harvest," and even "after the autumn harvest" should not be left unaccounted for. Not enforcing the law is indulgence, which will cause the law to lose its dignity, and more and more people will ignore or even trample on the law, leading to social turmoil.

### 大学生不是特殊公民

　　大学生不是特殊公民
    本报北京６月１３日讯  据有关部门提供：一位北京大学毕业生日前给有关部门写了一封信，信件内容如下：
    这次由学潮开始的动乱发展到反革命暴乱，死伤了成百上千的人，给国家财产造成了数亿元的损失，我感到十分痛心。
    作为一名早几届的北京大学毕业生，我想向社会讲几句话。我觉得现在的某些大学生政治素质太差，而又自高自大，为所欲为。群众对他们过于宠爱，党和政府也对他们过于宽容、迁就，甚至违法不究，才使得动乱愈演愈烈。
    党和政府这几年的最大失误是对教育重视不够，主要是忽视了对大学生的政治思想教育，包括共产主义理想教育、四项基本原则教育、组织纪律性教育和道德品质教育，使不少大学生被资产阶级自由化腐蚀了、俘虏了，成了资产阶级的接班人。
    不少大学生没有系统地学过马列主义毛泽东思想理论，却不加批判地接受了不少资产阶级理论。他们许多人不大了解共和国的建立经历了怎样艰难曲折的历程，不大了解新中国为什么只能走社会主义道路，因而对党和人民政府缺乏深厚的感情。他们没有经历过１０年动乱，不知道珍惜得之不易的安定团结的局面。我和我的同学们是结束１０年动乱后，由邓小平同志亲自提议恢复高考制度后首批上大学的，因此十分珍惜学习的机会，对党和政府是有感激之情的。３５周年国庆游行的时候，大学生们发自内心地打出“小平您好”横幅，充分说明了这一点。现在有些在校大学生却谩骂攻击我国改革开放的总设计师邓小平同志，真是不可思议。近年不少大学生很少接触劳动，接近工农群众，不懂得是他们的同龄人年轻的解放军战士，用鲜血和生命保卫祖国，才使得他们能在和平的环境下学习；不懂得是他们的同龄人年轻的工人农民，用辛勤和汗水创造了大量物质财富，才使得他们能免费上大学。比起这些同龄人来，我们的大学生对社会的奉献还很少，没有任何理由自高自大，更不能俨然以新的救世主自居。我们还很贫穷的祖国就像一个大家庭，哥哥姐姐们用自己的劳动供养弟弟妹妹们上学，弟弟妹妹们理所当然地应当珍惜学习机会。
    判断一个人，重要的不是听其言，而是观其行。判断这次学潮的性质，也不能光看他们喊了什么口号，打过什么旗帜，而是要看他们的所作所为和引起的后果。检验真理的标准只能是社会实践。
    我认为，这次学潮以来，有极少数学生手段卑鄙，目的更不可告人。这些人蒙蔽利用了广大学生，欺骗了社会舆论。他们言行不一，口是心非，从一开始就把自己摆到党和政府的对立面，甚至妄想凌驾于党和政府之上，成为特殊公民。他们对党和国家领导人苦口婆心的劝说根本不听，甚至用威胁的口吻说什么，不答应这个条件就罢课就游行，不答应那个条件就静坐就绝食。他们对党的领导抽象肯定，具体否定。在他们的演说中，党所领导的人民政府是独裁、无能、腐败的政府，党和国家主要领导人没有一个好人，通通要打倒。这哪里还看得见“拥护共产党”的影子？他们在校园里和天安门广场上每天用高音喇叭转播美国之音，竖立所谓中国化的美国自由女神像，干扰举世瞩目的重大国事活动，到处煽动罢课、罢工，惟恐国家不乱。这怎么能谈得上“爱国”？他们一面不断到许多新闻单位去闹，高喊“新闻要讲真话”，一面每天在各主要街道的电线杆上和天安门广场的喇叭里炮制大量耸人听闻的谣言。他们一面说政府不重视教育，一面不但自己不上课，还鼓动中小学生罢课。他们一面说要“维护宪法尊严”、“要法制不要人治”，一面又成立非法组织，搞违法游行，带头在４月底冲击中南海，不断进行违反宪法的蛊惑宣传。更不用说他们在北京市带头违反市容交通法规，骑车带人，乱扔废弃物，把神圣庄严的天安门广场变成臭气熏天的肮脏垃圾堆了。戒严令颁布以后，他们自以为只要标榜“爱国”就可以无法无天，对戒严令置若罔闻，继续游行示威，贴标语造谣言。一些人积极参与了拦截军车殴打解放军指战员的反革命暴乱。直到今日，还有一些学生仍拒不复课，四处串联，到处煽动罢课、罢工，甚至扬言要发动更大的所谓“爱国民主运动”，反动气焰十分嚣张。
    我认为政府对这些大学生太过于迁就了，前一个时期舆论界对这些大学生太过于吹捧了，以至于这些大学生一度成了神圣不可侵犯的社会主宰，高高在上的特殊公民，什么法律法令法规都管不了他们，甚至那些流氓地痞、盗窃抢劫犯都纷纷声称自己是大学生。
    痛定思痛，我希望每个有良知的大学生和公民都来反思这个问题。疾呼在法律面前人人平等，大学生不能成为特殊公民。任何人都不能借口“爱国无罪”就可以为所欲为。非法组织一成立就立即取缔，对违法游行一上街就坚决止住，触犯刑律的更要依法追究其刑事责任。大学生犯法与民同罪。对违法犯罪的大学生决不能等到“秋后”再去惩处，更不能连“秋后”都不算账。有法不依就是放纵，就会使法律失去其尊严，就会使越来越多的人无视甚至践踏法律，就会酿成社会动乱。
