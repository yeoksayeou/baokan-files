This year, the renowned overseas Chinese hometown of Shishi City, Fujian Province, has a heartwarming story circulating in every alley and lane: the village cadres took the lead in changing customs and eliminating superstition, transforming the ancestral hall into a senior citizens' association and recreational center.

Spending the later years in peace and enjoying leisure activities is the wish of every senior citizen. After the Double Ninth Festival last year, the Party branch and village committee of Kengdong Village decided to renovate an ancestral hall, built a few years ago at a cost of 294,600 yuan, into the premises for the senior citizens' association and a recreational venue for the elderly. Initially, some people were not in favor of this decision: the ancestral hall is a place to honor gods and ancestors, and it has been housing over 400 spirit tablets. How can we move the ancestors' spirit tablets? Through the patient and meticulous guidance of the cadres, the villagers soon changed their outdated ideas and donated money and items. Within a few days, they raised 2,500 yuan, and some even donated televisions, tape recorders, stools, chairs, and musical instruments, enabling the renovation plan to proceed smoothly.

The Kengdong Village Senior Citizens' Association was established amidst the sounds of drums and firecrackers. A grand ancestral hall, once filled with spirit tablets of ancestors, has been transformed into a recreational home for grandfathers and grandmothers. The Shishi City and Shishi Town governments specially sent representatives to offer congratulations and presented a golden plaque with the inscription "Senior Citizens' Home."

　　祠堂变成“老人之家”
    今年初，著名侨乡福建石狮市坑东村，村头巷尾流传这样一段佳话：咱村干部带头移风易俗，破封建除迷信，改祖宗的祠堂为老年协会和老年娱乐中心。
    安度晚年、娱乐身心，是老年人的渴望。去年重阳节后，坑东村党支部、村委会决定将几年前建造的一幢造价２９４６００多元的祠堂，改修成老年协会会址，改为老年娱乐场所。这一决定，起初有人不同意：祠堂是敬神敬祖的地方，堂内一直安放着４００多座灵位，让列祖列宗易位，这怎么行！经过干部们耐心细致的疏导，村民们很快改变了陈旧观念，并纷纷捐款捐物，几天之内捐款２５００多元，有的还捐赠了电视机、录音机、凳椅、乐器等，使改修计划得以顺利进行。
    坑东村老年协会在一片锣鼓声、鞭炮声中成立。一座列祖列宗安放灵龛的大祠堂，变成了爷爷奶奶们的娱乐之家。石狮市、石狮镇人民政府特地派人前来祝贺，并赠送了“老年之家”的金匾。
