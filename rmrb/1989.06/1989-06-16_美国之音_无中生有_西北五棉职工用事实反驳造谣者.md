Voice of America Fabricates Lies
Workers of Northwest Cotton Mill Five Refute Rumors with Facts

New China News Agency, Xi'an, June 15 - Recently, some workers of Northwest Cotton Mill Five wrote an article using facts to refute the fabrications and slanders of the Voice of America.

On the evening of June 6, the Voice of America broadcasted, "The workers in the textile city of Xi'an, including the Third, Fourth, Fifth, and Sixth Cotton Mills, have gone on a full-scale strike." Workers of Northwest Cotton Mill Five said that this news is pure fabrication. From June 5 to 8, a very small number of people in Xi'an incited some students and a few misinformed individuals to surround large and medium-sized enterprises in Xi'an, block workers from entering the factories, and instigate them to go on strike. Facing this situation, the broad masses of workers in our factory, while persuading and educating the students, insisted on going to work. At that time, the main gate of the factory was blocked, so the workers entered the factory through side gates and other passages. After the city's public transportation was disrupted, many workers either took taxis, rode bicycles, or even walked to the factory. Those days, the attendance rate of the entire factory remained above 86%. The neighboring Third, Fourth, and Sixth Cotton Mills also maintained production during those two days, and there was absolutely no so-called "strike." These workers finally questioned the Voice of America: You fabricate lies and stir up trouble, what do you really want to achieve?

### “美国之音”无中生有  西北五棉职工用事实反驳造谣者

　　“美国之音”无中生有
    西北五棉职工用事实反驳造谣者
    新华社西安６月１５日电  西北国棉五厂部分职工近日写文章用事实回击“美国之音”的造谣诬蔑。
    ６月６日晚，“美国之音”广播说，“西安纺织城地区的国棉三、四、五、六厂已全面罢工”。西北国棉五厂的职工说，这条消息纯属造谣，６月５日至８日，西安有极少数人煽动部分学生和不明真相的少数群众到西安大中型企业围堵工厂，阻拦工人上班，鼓动工人罢工。面对这种情况，我厂广大职工在说服教育学生的同时坚持上班。当时，工厂正门被堵，工人们就从侧门和其他通道进入工厂。市区公共交通受阻后，不少职工，或坐出租车，或骑自行车，有的甚至步行，纷纷赶到工厂上班。那几天，全厂职工出勤率始终保持在８６％以上。同我们相邻的国棉三厂、四厂、六厂，那两天也都坚持生产，根本没有发生所谓“罢工”之事。这些职工最后质问“美国之音”：你们无中生有，造谣生事，到底想干什么？
