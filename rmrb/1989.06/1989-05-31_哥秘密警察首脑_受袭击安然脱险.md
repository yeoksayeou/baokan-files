Yesterday morning at around 7 a.m., a car bomb exploded in the eastern part of Bogota, resulting in 5 deaths and over a hundred injuries.

The target of this terrorist attack was the head of Colombia's secret police, Martha Marquez. At the time, she was traveling to work in an armored car. A group calling itself the "Workers' Self-Defense Guerrilla Squad" claimed responsibility for the attack, stating that they had previously assassinated Colombia's former Minister of the Interior. The police confirmed that the car used in the attack was stolen a few days prior in Medellin. Local newspapers speculated that this attack might be related to the Medellin Cartel drug trafficking organization, as Martha Marquez was leading anti-drug operations.

　　哥秘密警察首脑
    受袭击安然脱险
    本报加拉加斯５月３１日电  记者朱满庭报道：昨天早晨７时许，一颗汽车炸弹在波哥大东城地区爆炸，造成５人死亡、百余人受伤。
    这次恐怖主义袭击事件攻击的目标是哥伦比亚秘密警察首脑马撒·马尔克斯。当时他正乘防弹汽车经此地去上班。一个自称“工人自卫游击小组”的组织打电话承认这次事件是他们干的，这个组织曾暗杀了哥伦比亚前内务部长。警方确认袭击中使用的汽车是几天前在麦德林城失窃的，当地报纸认为，这次袭击事件可能与麦德林卡特尔贩毒集团有关，因为马撒·马尔克斯正进行扫毒工作。
