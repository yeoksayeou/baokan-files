Guangzhou prosecutors have established a reporting office that has been operating for a year, diligently handling public reports and playing an active role in combating corruption and promoting integrity.

On June 1st of last year, the Guangzhou Municipal Prosecutor's Office was the first among major cities in the country to establish an economic crime reporting office, opening an important channel for the public to supervise state officials.

Statistics show that over the past year, the city's prosecutors received 2,162 reports of illegal and criminal activities from the public. Among these, 1,141 cases involved suspected embezzlement and bribery, with 337 major leads involving amounts over 100,000 yuan, totaling 17.56 million yuan and 1.6 million Hong Kong dollars. Nearly 70% of the cases that the prosecutors could investigate in the past year were provided by public reports. A worker named Zhang Maoyun from a certain unit colluded with lawless elements, using his position to illegally handle "agricultural to non-agricultural" household registrations for over 60 people, extorting between 2,500 and 6,500 yuan from each, totaling over 200,000 yuan in bribes over three years. After receiving reports from the public, the Yuexiu District Prosecutor's Office immediately launched an investigation and arrested Zhang. The case has recently been filed with the court.

The establishment of the reporting office has increased the vitality and transparency of the prosecutors' work. The prosecutors have timely commended and rewarded individuals who provided valuable reports, severely punished those who retaliated, and protected the public's legal rights to expose and report corruption. Now, there are fewer anonymous letters and phone calls, and more people are willing to provide their real names. The public says, "The prosecutors have given us the courage, and righteousness has suppressed evil."

The Guangzhou Municipal Prosecutor's Office has consistently placed the fight against embezzlement and bribery as the top priority in combating economic crimes, focusing on processing and investigating public reports, and quickly solving major cases. By the end of last year, the public reported that some mid-level leaders of the Municipal Housing Management Bureau were taking bribes during the reconstruction of the Xiaoma Station residential area. The Yuexiu District Prosecutors, along with the deputy prosecutors, led the investigation team to visit 15 units, interviewed nearly 100 people, and successfully solved four major cases involving Zhang Bolong, the deputy director of the Construction Section of the Housing Management Bureau's Labor Service Company, who took 80,000 yuan in bribes; Ye Jiancheng, the party branch secretary of the company, who took over 30,000 yuan in bribes; Shi Weirong, the deputy director of the Finance Section, who extorted 9,000 yuan; and Peng Guoxiong, an engineer, who took over 10,000 yuan in bribes. An old resident said, "These 'housing tigers' were only out to make money, causing trouble for the people. The prosecutors have removed the harm for us."

Over the past year, the reporting offices of the city's prosecutors have handled 482 cases through the investigation of public reports, arresting over 100 serious economic criminals and filing them with the court, promoting the development of clean governance.

　　遏制贪污受贿　致力肃贪倡廉
    广州检察机关查结举报案四百多件
    本报讯  据《广州日报》报道：广州市检察机关成立举报室一年来，努力处理公民的举报，在肃贪倡廉、消除腐败现象方面起了积极作用。
    去年六月一日，广州市各级检察机关在全国大城市检察院中率先建立经济罪案举报室，为群众监督国家机关工作人员开辟了一条重要的渠道。
    据统计，全市检察机关一年来收到公民举报违法犯罪的线索共二千一百六十二件，其中涉嫌贪污受贿等一千一百四十一件，涉及万元以上重大线索三百三十七条，总金额一千七百五十六万多元，港币一百六十多万元。检察机关近一年可侦查的案件，有百分之七十是公民举报提供的。某单位工作人员张玛云，与社会上不法分子勾搭，利用职权，采取十分诡秘的手段，非法替六十多人办理“农转非”的户口，每个索款二千五百元至六千五百元，三年来共索贿受贿二十多万元。越秀区检察院收到群众的举报后，立即开展侦查，终于把张依法逮捕，近日已向法院起诉。
    举报室的建立，增加了检察机关工作的活力和透明度，检察机关及时表彰奖励举报有功人员，严肃惩处打击报复者，保护了公民检举揭发的合法权利，有力地支持公民对贪污受贿腐败现象作斗争。现在，举报信件和电话中，匿名的越来越少，敢讲真名实姓的越来越多。群众说，“检察院壮了我们的胆子，正气压了邪气。”
    广州市检察机关坚持把反对贪污受贿的斗争列为打击经济犯罪的第一位工作，抓好对公民举报材料的消化、查处，突出重点，迅速侦破大案。去年底，群众举报了市房管局一些中层领导干部乘改建小马站住宅区之机索贿受贿。越秀区检察院正副检察长带领办案人员，反复到十五个单位调查取证，访问了近百名群众，一举侦破了市房管局劳动服务公司基建科副科长张伯龙受贿八万元、公司党支部书记叶建成受贿三万多元、公司财务科副科长施伟荣索贿九千元、工程师彭国雄受贿一万多元等四起重要案件。有一位老街坊说：“这些‘房老虎’一味捞油水，害苦老百姓，检察院为民除了祸害。”
    全市检察机关举报室建立一年，通过对公民举报线索的查处，已查结四百八十二件，把一百多名严重的经济犯罪分子依法逮捕归案，陆续向法院起诉，促进了廉政建设的开展。
