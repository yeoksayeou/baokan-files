Mexican President Salinas has been in office for just half a year, and no one expected him to consolidate his ruling party's position so quickly and restore confidence in economic growth.

Salinas took office amidst a prolonged economic crisis, and his election was by a narrow majority. Salinas clearly saw that Mexico's debt and economic crises were long-term issues, and the economic situation could not fundamentally improve in a short period. Therefore, he had to open a "second front" to quickly improve the image and position of the ruling party. In the past few months, Salinas has successfully waged "three major battles" on the "second front": one against corruption, two against speculation, and three against drug lords. This not only affected key figures within the ruling party but also struck at illegal and corrupt practices within the government and judicial departments, producing a good impact both domestically and internationally. Recently, 68 U.S. senators wrote to Salinas, expressing their "admiration and support" for his actions.

**Against Corruption**
As early as the late 1930s, then-President Cardenas, in order to curb the power of the business class and consolidate the ruling party's position, enacted the "Trade Union Law," granting various powers to trade union organizations. As a result, trade unions rapidly developed and became a major pillar and important social force above the working masses. Some industry unions turned into "gangs," with union leaders acting as "godfathers," doing as they pleased. The oil workers' union was particularly notorious. Led by figures like Huaxin and Balagan, the oil workers' union leaders used their control over state oil engineering contracts to engage in nepotism and squander resources. As the general secretary of the oil workers' union, Balagan gambled away $30 million in one go at an Atlantic City casino in the United States. It was found that Huaxin, Balagan, and several other oil workers' union leaders had $3.2 billion in deposits in U.S. banks. Salinas believed that only by eliminating the "corruption center" of the oil workers' union leaders could other corrupt practices within the party and government be punished. Therefore, the government, using the pretext of Huaxin and others smuggling weapons, decisively deployed the military to arrest the main culprits and placed important oil industry departments under military control, quickly suppressing the turmoil. Then, using facts to persuade various factions within the ruling party and gaining the support of some unions, the ruling party not only did not split but also strengthened its authority.

**Against Speculation**
In the past two years, the Mexican stock market has been bullish, while domestic production has been stagnant and declining, which is extremely inconsistent with the abnormal rise of the stock market. This indicates rampant speculative activities in trading. Last autumn, the Mexican Stock Exchange experienced a serious crisis, and many people went bankrupt as a result. In February this year, the Federal Prosecutor's Office, based on intelligence, arrested four officials of the Mexican Stock Exchange, including Legoreta, and uncovered the truth behind the stock market crash, which shocked the Mexican financial and political circles. Legoreta and others thought that by politically aligning with the ruling party, they could use the stock market for speculation and do as they pleased. However, the Salinas government still eliminated the ringleaders of speculation and cleaned up the stock market to create a healthy environment for economic activities.

**Against Drug Lords**
Salinas' third "battle" was to take decisive measures against the notorious drug kingpin Gallardo and his extensive network within the government's judicial department. The authorities had long been aware of the Gallardo case, but a corrupt network had protected this drug lord who had been rampant for 20 years. The Salinas government exposed the dark and corrupt practices within the government's judicial department along with the drug lord, indicating that the Salinas government is not ambiguous on the issue of anti-drug and anti-corruption, which relates to the future of the nation.

Salinas' "three major battles" improved the image of the ruling party and consolidated his ruling position. The United States also expressed support for the "political courage" of the Salinas government. Of course, for the ambitious Salinas, this is only the first step in achieving his proposed "deep reforms in Mexico."

　　墨西哥：“第二战线”的“三大战役”
    本报记者  郭伟成
    墨西哥总统萨利纳斯执政刚刚半年，他执政之初，谁也没有预料到他会这样迅速地巩固其执政党的地位，并且重新建立起人们对经济增长的信心。
    萨利纳斯是在国家面临持续已久的经济危机的情况下开始执政的，而且他当时是微弱多数当选的。萨利纳斯清楚地看到，由于墨西哥的债务危机与经济危机是长期形成的，经济形势不可能在短时间内实现根本性好转，因此，必须开辟“第二战线”，争取尽快改善执政党的形象与地位。几个月来，萨利纳斯在“第二战线”上成功地打了“三大战役”：一除腐败、二铲投机、三捉毒枭。这不仅触及到执政党内的要员，而且打击了政府与司法部门内的违法堕落现象，在国内外产生了很好的影响。美国６８位参议员不久前致信萨利纳斯，对他的行动表示“钦佩与支持”。
    除腐败　早在３０年代末，当时的卡德纳斯总统为了制约企业主阶级，稳固执政党的地位，制订了《工会组织法》，给工会团体以各种权力。结果，工会组织迅速发展，变成了执政党的主要支柱和凌驾工人群众之上的重要社会势力。有些行业工会成了“帮会”，工人领袖以“教父”自居，为所欲为。其中尤以石油工会为甚。以华金、巴拉甘等人为首的石油工会领导人利用工会掌握的国家石油工程承包合同权，徇私舞弊，肆意挥霍。身为石油工会总书记的巴拉甘，在美国大西洋赌城一掷万金，一次就挥霍３０万美元。经查实，华金、巴拉甘等几个石油工会领导人在美国银行拥有３２亿美元存款。萨利纳斯认定，只有搞掉石油工会领导人这一“腐败中心”，才能惩戒党和政府内的其它腐败现象。因此，政府以华金等人走私武器为由，果断地动用军队逮捕主犯，对重要的石油工业部门实行军管，以最短的时间平息了风波，然后以事实说服执政党内各派，争取到一些工会的支持，结果，执政党不仅没有发生分裂，还增强了权威。
    铲投机　近两年来，墨西哥股市交易一直看好，而国内生产却是停滞与下跌趋势，与股市的反常上涨极不协调。这说明交易中的投机活动猖獗。前年秋天，墨西哥股票交易所曾发生严重危机，不少人因之破产。今年２月，联邦总检察院根据情报，逮捕了以莱戈雷塔为首的４名墨西哥股票交易所负责官员，搞清了那次股崩事件的真相，震动了墨西哥财界与政界。莱戈雷塔等人满以为在政治上依附于执政党就可以利用股市投机，为所欲为。但是，萨利纳斯政府还是铲去投机首恶，清理了股市，以便为经济活动创造一个健康的环境。
    捉毒枭　萨利纳斯的第三个“战役”是对各国通辑已久的头号毒王加利亚多及其在政府司法部门的庞大关系网采取了断然措施。当局对加利亚多一案早就知情，但是，腐败的关系网掩护了这个横行２０年的毒枭。萨利纳斯政府将政府司法部门内的黑暗腐败现象与毒枭一同曝光，这表明萨利纳斯政府在反毒反腐败这个关系到国家民族前途的问题上是不含糊的。
    萨利纳斯进行的“三大战役”改善了执政党的形象，巩固了自己的执政地位。美国也对萨利纳斯政府的“政治勇气”表示支持。当然，这对于踌躇满志的萨利纳斯来说，只是为实现他提出“在墨西哥进行深入变革”而走出的第一步。
