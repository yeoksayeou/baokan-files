The farewell ceremony for the body of Comrade Shen Baoying, an outstanding member of the Communist Party of China, a loyal communist warrior, and the widow of martyr Yun Daiying, was held today at the Baobao Mountain Revolutionary Public Cemetery Hall. Comrade Shen Baoying passed away in Beijing on June 12, 1989, due to illness, at the age of 83. Li Peng, Peng Zhen, Nie Rongzhen, Qiao Shi, Bo Yibo, Wen Jiabao, Hab Comrade Hab, Kang Keqing, Cai Chang, and other comrades, as well as the Central Office and the Central Directly Affiliated Units' Work Committee, sent wreaths.

Comrade Shen Baoying was born in October 1905 in Wuhan, Hubei Province, to an ordinary family. In 1922, at the age of 17, she enrolled in the Hubei Provincial Women's Normal School. In 1924, she joined the Communist Youth League at the school and transferred to the Communist Party in 1925. She served as the Youth Committee of the Communist Youth League branch of Hubei Provincial Women's Normal School, the propaganda and secretariat of the Women's Federation of Hubei Provincial First Primary School, and a teacher. In 1926, she married Comrade Yun Daiying. After the failure of the Great Revolution, the Party went underground. She followed Yun Daiying to Hong Kong to work as a propaganda officer in the Central Propaganda Department, a secretary in the Central Organization Department in Shanghai, and a women's committee member and factory branch secretary in the Shanghai Zhabei District Committee. She organized workers' struggles and revolutionary propaganda in factories, organizing women workers' night schools. During the War of Resistance and the War of Liberation, she mainly worked on childcare and family support. After the founding of New China, she served as the secretary of the Northwest Nursery, the principal of the Lanzhou August 1st Primary School, the director of the Northwest Military Region Rear Services Nursery, and the director of the Central Office First Bureau Kindergarten. She retired in 1982.

Comrade Shen Baoying was an old party member and cadre who joined the party in the early days of the party's establishment, a loyal warrior who fought for the cause of communism for more than 60 years. From the time she decided to revolutionize and join the Communist Party, she remained steadfast in her communist ideals for decades, unwavering in her belief in the party's cause. In every critical moment of party struggles and revolutionary struggles, she demonstrated a strong sense of party principles. Throughout her long revolutionary career, she endured the hardships of revolutionary struggles and the ups and downs of personal family life, always maintaining the excellent qualities of a Communist Party member who strives hard and serves the people with integrity. She never cared about personal status and treatment, nor did she ask for special care from the organization. Her eldest son and daughter-in-law worked in Shanghai. The organization had repeatedly proposed to transfer them to Beijing to take care of her life. Although she also missed her grandchildren and hoped they could be by her side to enjoy family happiness, after careful consideration, she still declined the organization's care.

　　中共优秀党员　恽代英烈士遗孀    
    沈葆英同志逝世
    新华社北京６月２４日电  向中国共产党优秀党员、忠诚的共产主义战士、恽代英烈士的遗孀沈葆英同志遗体告别仪式今天在八宝山革命公墓礼堂举行。沈葆英同志是１９８９年６月１２日因病在北京逝世的，终年８３岁。李鹏、彭真、聂荣臻、乔石、薄一波、温家宝、习仲勋、康克清、蔡畅等同志以及中央办公厅、中央直属机关工委等单位送了花圈。
    沈葆英同志１９０５年１０月出生于湖北省武汉市一个普通市民家庭。１９２２年１７岁时考入湖北省立女子师范学校读书，１９２４年在该校加入共产主义青年团，１９２５年转党，曾任湖北省女子师范学校共青团支部青年委员，湖北省立第一完小教员兼妇女协会宣委、秘书。１９２６年和恽代英同志结为伴侣。大革命失败后党转入地下斗争，她随恽代英同志先后在香港任中央宣传部宣传干事，上海中央组织部秘书，上海闸北区委妇女委员兼工厂支部书记等职，曾深入工厂组织工人斗争，组织女工夜校开展革命宣传工作。抗战时期和解放战争时期她主要做战时儿童保育工作和家属工作。新中国成立后，她先后任西北保育院秘书，兰州八一完小教导主任，西北军区后勤部保育院院长，中央办公厅一局幼儿园主任等职，１９８２年转为离休。
    沈葆英同志是一位在我党建党初期入党的老党员、老干部，是一位为共产主义事业奋斗了６０余年的忠诚战士。她从立志革命、参加共产党时起，几十年如一日，对共产主义理想矢志不渝，对党的事业坚信不移，在历次党内斗争和革命的严峻关键时刻，都表现出很强的党性原则。在漫长的革命生涯中，她历尽革命斗争的艰险，也历尽个人家庭生活的坎坷，始终保持着共产党员艰苦奋斗、廉洁奉公的优良品质。她从不计较个人名位待遇，从不要求组织上的特殊照顾。她大儿子、儿媳在上海工作，组织上曾多次提出拟调来北京以照顾她的生活，她虽然也想念儿孙，希望他们在自己身边共享天伦之乐，但经再三考虑，还是谢绝了组织上的关怀。
