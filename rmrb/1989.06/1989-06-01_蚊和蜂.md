	Mosquitoes and Bees
	Xie Yun

	As the summer heat approaches, one can't help but think of mosquitoes. People have always hated and cursed these pests for biting and sucking blood. Fu Xuan's "Mosquito Elegy" states: "They hinder farmers in the fields, and disrupt women's work at the loom," listing their crimes; Liu Yuxi's "Gathering Mosquitoes" says: "The clear notes of the autumn morning, shame on you, tiny form, feeding the vermilion birds," which is a curse. Mr. Lu Xun in "Summer Insects" expresses his particular dislike for their humming before sucking blood, thinking it is not as direct and straightforward as the flea's silent bite.

	I think the mosquito's humming is indeed annoying, but at least before biting and sucking blood, it does announce its presence with a kind of "blood-sucking warning." People can hear the humming and take precautions, avoid, or even counterattack—with a slap to kill it. So this humming is somewhat beneficial to humans. If the humming is indeed explaining that human blood should be used to satisfy its hunger, and if people could understand it, they could also argue with it. Even if people do not have the right to argue at that moment, the sound left in the world becomes evidence and a negative example. As for fleas, they give no warning at all, do not explain anything, and just bite without a sound. In terms of ruthlessness and cunning, fleas are indeed worse than mosquitoes.

	But mosquitoes also have a type that does not hum before biting. In the past, while working in the labor camp, after a day's labor, sitting on a small stool in front of the thatched hut in the summer evening, looking at the stars, mosquitoes would often silently attack. By the time I felt the pain and itch, they had already sucked enough blood and flown away. At that time, I thought that the humming mosquitoes were at least a bit lovable. These mosquitoes that do not hum before biting are generally smaller in body and mainly appear in late summer and early autumn. Whether they belong to another species of mosquito, or because the weather is getting colder and their arrogance has waned, making them not even dare to hum, I do not know.

	As a child, I was once stung by a bee, and it hurt a lot, leaving a red swelling for half a day. Since then, I have had a fear of this small flying insect. It was not until I grew up and tasted the nutritious and delicious honey that I realized people can use bees to serve their own interests. At the same time, I learned that this insect can also pollinate crops, benefiting the harvest of crops and fruit trees. In addition, it is an amazing architect and has a strong sense of organization and collective spirit, so I developed a respect for bees.

	During this time, I also read many poems and essays praising bees: working all their lives, self-sacrificing, selfless dedication... they are models for humans to learn from. But one day, I felt very uncomfortable with these praises.

	That was in May-June of the previous year, during the time when jujube flowers were fragrant. A beekeeper in my residential compound set up dozens of bee boxes. So in my spare time, I often went to watch the beekeeper's work and occasionally chatted with them. At that time, I witnessed for the first time how people, like thieves, steal the results of bees' labor. Watching those hardworking bees flying back and forth all day, busily working, I suddenly remembered two lines of poetry by Luo Yin: "After gathering nectar from a hundred flowers, for whom do they toil, for whom do they sweeten?"

	What shocked me even more was the process of extracting royal jelly. This involves using artificially made royal cells to trick bees into feeding royal jelly to the larvae inside, and then using a special tweezers to remove and kill the larvae, while scraping out the royal jelly that the bees have carefully made. This is not just "stealing," but almost like a "speculative business."

	I am not a moralist, nor a Buddhist. I do not think it is against human or animal nature for humans to kill pigs, sheep, fish, and turtles for their survival, development, and enjoyment. But I believe that protecting certain rare birds and animals, preventing their extinction, is ultimately for ecological balance, not out of pity or justice.

　　蚊和蜂
    谢云
    炎夏将至，不免想起蚊子来。对这家伙的咬人吸血，人们历来痛恨，且多诅咒。傅选《蚊赋》：“妨农夫于南亩，废女工于机杼”，是数它的罪状；刘禹锡《聚蚊谣》：“清商一来秋日晓，羞尔微形饲丹鸟”，则是一种诅咒。而鲁迅先生在《夏三虫》中，表示尤其讨厌其于吮血之前，先要“哼哼地发一篇大议论”，以为实不如跳蚤的“一声不响地就是一口”，来得“直接爽快”。
    我以为蚊子的哼哼固然讨厌，但毕竟在噆肤吮血之前，总还是打了几声招呼，发出了一种“喝血预告”。人们也可以由听到的哼哼之声而早为防范，躲避，直至反击——啪的一声将其击毙，所以这哼哼于人毕竟有些好处。如果其哼哼确是在说明人血应该给它充饥的理由，而人们又能听懂的话，也还可以与之争辩一番。即使人们当时并无与之争辩之权，但那声音留在人间，一旦到了可以理论的时候，便成了罪证和反面教材。若夫跳蚤，一点招呼也不打，更不跟你讲什么理，上来就是一口，论其霸道和阴狠，实在较蚊子更甚。
    但蚊子也有在咬人之前，并不哼哼的。早些年在干校，劳动了一天，夏日晚间坐在茅屋前的小板凳上看星星，便常有蚊子悄然无声地袭来，待感到痛痒难熬时，它早已吸饱了血，飘然不知去向。这时我就觉得，那事前哼哼者，毕竟多少有点可爱。这种不哼而下口的蚊子，一般躯体较小，而且主要出现于夏末初秋之际。是属于蚊的另一种类，还是因为天气转凉，气焰已衰，连哼哼也不敢，就不知道了。
    童年时，曾经被蜜蜂螫过，疼得很，而且红肿了半天。从此，对这小小的飞虫便存了一种惧怕之心。直到长大品尝到营养丰富、甜美可口的蜂蜜，才知道人们是可以利用蜜蜂来为自己的利益服务的。同时，又知道这飞虫还能为农作物授粉，有益于庄稼和果树的丰收。此外，它还是了不起的天才建筑师，并且极有组织性和集体精神，于是对蜜蜂颇生了敬佩之意。
    而在这期间，也读到了不少赞美蜜蜂的诗文：终生劳动，自奉甚俭，无私奉献……简直是人类学习的楷模。但终于有一天，我对这些赞词，感到很不舒服。
    那是前年５—６月间，正当枣花飘香之时，一个养蜂专业户，在我住的大院子里，安下了几十箱蜂。于是闲暇时，我便常去看看养蜂人的劳作，偶尔也跟他们聊聊天。这时，我第一次亲眼目睹到人是怎样像窃贼一样，偷取了蜜蜂劳动的成果的。看着那些辛勤的蜜蜂终日飞来飞去，忙个不停的情形，我忽然想起罗隐的两句诗来：“采得百花成蜜后，为谁辛苦为谁甜？”
    更使我震惊的，是采取王浆的过程。那是先用人工做成的王台，骗得蜜蜂给里面的幼虫饲喂王浆，然后再用一种特制的镊子，把幼虫取出弄死，而将蜜蜂精心酿制的最佳营养品——王浆刷出来。这就不只是“偷窃”，而简直是近乎“官倒”营生了。
    我不是道德家，更非佛教徒，对于人类为了自身的生存、发展和享受，杀猪宰羊，烹鱼蒸鳖，并不认为有违人道或兽道禽道。但愚以为保护某种珍禽异兽，免其灭绝，说到底也是为了生态平衡，并非缘于怜悯和正义。
