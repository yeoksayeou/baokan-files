    Xinhua News Agency, Pyongyang, June 10 - Seoul: Seoul District Court recently announced that Chun Doo-hwan's cousin, Chun Woo-hwan, was sentenced to 10 months in prison and fined 550 million South Korean won for accepting bribes.

    During Chun Doo-hwan's presidency, Chun Woo-hwan served as the chairman of the South Korean Flour Processing Association Central Committee. He abused his power for personal gain and accepted bribes. After Chun Doo-hwan's resignation in February last year, the crimes of his family were exposed. So far, more than 10 members of the Chun family have been arrested or sentenced.

    Chun Woo-hwan was arrested on August 19 last year on charges of bribery. Seoul District Court sentenced him to 10 months in prison and a fine of 550 million South Korean won. Chun Woo-hwan appealed the verdict. The court recently rejected his appeal, upholding the original sentence.

　　全斗焕堂弟被判刑
    新华社平壤６月１０日电  汉城消息：汉城地方法院日前宣布，南朝鲜前总统全斗焕的堂弟全愚焕因接受贿赂被判处有期徒刑１０个月，罚款５５０万南朝鲜元。
    全愚焕在全斗焕任总统期间当上了南朝鲜粮食加工协会中央委员会会长。他依仗权势营私舞弊和受贿。去年２月，全斗焕下台后，他的家族的罪行被揭露。目前，全氏家族已有１０多人被捕或判刑。
    全愚焕于去年８月１９日以受贿罪被捕。汉城地方法院判处他１０个月有期徒刑，罚款５５０万南朝鲜元。全愚焕不服，提出上诉。法院最近驳回他的申诉，维持原判。
