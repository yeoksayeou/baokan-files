	The dollar against the yen and mark rose on June 12 in the Western European foreign exchange market, reaching the highest level in two and a half years.

	When the Frankfurt foreign exchange market closed, the dollar against the West German mark rose from 1:2.0050 on June 9 to 1:2.0260. In London, the dollar against the yen rose from 1:146.25 on June 9 to 1:148.95, and against the mark to 1:2.0250. The dollar also rose against other major Western European currencies.

	Due to the strong dollar, gold prices fell. On June 12, the London gold market closed at $360 per ounce, the lowest price in 33 months.

	In Tokyo, the yen exchange rate fell to 148.4 yen per dollar today, the lowest level since August 18, 1987.

	The Bank of Japan is currently preparing to coordinate with the monetary authorities of major Western countries to strengthen market intervention. It also plans to raise short-term market interest rates to narrow the interest rate differential between Japan and the United States if the trend of buying dollars cannot be stopped. Today, the Bank of Japan intervened twice by releasing $200 million into the market, but the intervention had no effect.

　　美元对日元马克比价攀升
    新华社北京６月１３日电  综合本社记者报道：西欧外汇市场上１２日美元对马克的比价上升到两年半来的最高水平。
    当法兰克福外汇市场收盘时，美元对西德马克的比价由９日的１∶２．００５０上升到１∶２．０２６０；在伦敦，美元对日元的比价由９日的１∶１４６．２５上升到１∶１４８．９５，对马克的比价上升到１∶２．０２５０。美元对其它西欧主要货币的汇价也均上升。
    由于美元坚挺，黄金价格下跌。１２日伦敦黄金市场收盘时，每盎司降到３６０美元，为３３个月来的最低价格。
    新华社东京６月１２日电　今天，在东京外汇市场上，日元汇价跌至１美元兑１４８．４日元。这是自１９８７年８月１８日以来日元兑换美元的最低水平。
    日本中央银行当前准备与西方主要国家通货当局协调，加强市场干预，并且打算在抢购美元的势头难以制止的情况下，提高短期金融市场的利息，以缩小日美间的利息差距。今天日本中央银行两次向市场抛出两亿美元进行干预，但未收到效果。
