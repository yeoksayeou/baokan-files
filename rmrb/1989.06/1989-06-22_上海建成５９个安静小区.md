Shanghai's environmental protection department, in collaboration with relevant factories and enterprises, has been actively addressing fixed-source noise pollution. To date, the city has established 59 quiet residential areas, benefiting 2.87 million residents.

Many factories and enterprises in Shanghai are located within residential areas. The mechanical equipment in these factories often produces noise during operation, disturbing the rest and mental health of nearby residents, who have expressed strong dissatisfaction. In recent years, Shanghai's environmental protection department, in conjunction with district authorities and relevant factories and enterprises, has been working to mitigate these fixed-source noise issues, aiming to create quiet residential areas on a street-by-street basis.

Statistics show that the city has invested over 18.7 million yuan to address noise pollution from 1,792 units and 4,022 fixed noise sources. The environmental protection department plans to establish 19 more quiet residential areas this year and aims to make Xuhui and Huangpu districts into quiet urban areas.

　　上海建成５９个安静小区
    新华社上海６月２２日电（记者季进成）上海环保部门会同有关工厂、企业，积极治理固定源噪声。到目前为止，全市已建成５９个安静小区，２８７万居民受益。
    上海相当多的工厂、企业夹杂在居民住宅区中，不少工厂、企业的机械设备在操作中发出噪声，影响周围居民的休息和身心健康，群众反映强烈。近几年来，上海环保部门会同地区及有关工厂、企业，对这些固定源噪声进行治理，以街道为单位建设安静小区。
    据统计，全市已投资１８７０多万元，对１７９２个单位的４０２２个固定噪声源进行治理。上海环保部门计划今年再建１９个安静小区，并计划先将徐汇、黄浦两个区建成安静城区。
