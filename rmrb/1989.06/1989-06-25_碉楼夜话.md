In the depths of the mountains of Sichuan's Maoxian County, there is the Baihe Township of the Qiang ethnic minority. To truly understand the unique appearance of the Qiang people's watchtowers, we stopped here. Half an hour's climb from the township government, we entered the Baihe Village. Zhou Xiangcheng, a 67-year-old Qiang elder, welcomed us into his watchtower. He told us that this watchtower has been passed down for several hundred years.

The Qiang people "live in the mountains and build houses with stones." Using stone blocks and stone chips as materials and yellow mud as a binder, constructing watchtowers and stone houses is a specialty of every Qiang person. During construction, they do not draw plans, use plumb lines, or rely on scaffolding, but rather rely on artistic imagination and build freely. These houses are not only sturdy and durable but also withstand multiple earthquakes without collapsing. Watchtowers are typically divided into three layers: the bottom layer is for livestock, the middle layer is for living, and the top layer is for storing grain and other items.

One day of touring Baihe, we lingered and forgot to return, unaware that the evening was approaching. At this time, the mountain rain was drizzling. After more than two hours on the mountain path, we were a bit tired, so we rested in a village called "Xiadu."

By coincidence, the Du Hongguan family in the village had just completed a new watchtower. That night, the villagers, young and old, gathered at Du's place to drink "zhaojiu" to celebrate. Du Hongguan invited us. As guests from afar, we drank the first cup of wine among the singing and dancing of the villagers.

After drinking the zhaojiu, we sat by the fire pit. The villagers gathered around us and started chatting:

Chen Kaiyu, 35 years old. As the village leader, the first topic he discussed with me was the village's school. Obviously, this is a hot topic among the villagers. He said—

In Xiadu, there was a school starting in 1974, which was closed in 1983 because the higher authorities thought there were too many schools. Since then, the children in the village had to go to the township central school 10 li away to study. The children couldn't walk 10 li, not to mention crossing two suspension bridges. The parents also couldn't rest easy, and soon, there were almost no children studying in the village. I am determined to send my second son to school, but after two years, he only recognized about 20 characters. It turned out that he hadn't attended school for many days, just walked halfway and then returned, playing along the way. The sun would set just as he got home. There are dozens of people in the village, and no one is studying. It's urgent. Everyone bit the bullet, raised money, and the first time raised 500 yuan to make 20-plus desks. Soon, another 500 yuan was raised to buy kitchen utensils for the hired teacher and repair the classroom doors and windows. In 1986, the school was finally restored, and more than 10 school-age children put down their shepherd's hooks and picked up their school bags. Now, there are 22 students, divided into two grades, and one teacher teaches.

We mountain people have a principle: if we don't study, the gap with people outside the mountains will only widen. To fight for the school's legitimacy, I ran to the county education bureau several times, but I didn't get any recognition. Therefore, every penny of the school's expenses is raised by dozens of village households. Although we are doing our best, it is still a bit difficult to bear.

Chen Conglian, 35 years old, mother of five children (four boys and one girl). In Xiadu, there are quite a few women of her age with five or six children. I talked to her about the benefits of family planning. She said—

I don't want to have so many children either. Children are a burden to their mother. But here, the emperor is far away, and without a few sons, one is likely to be bullied. If there is any dispute or quarrel, one's backbone will not be strong. Moreover, without a few sons, one cannot become rich. The mountain paths are treacherous, and every year, at least a few thousand jin of goods are carried up and down the mountain. Men are also needed for this. Although the land is scarce, there is plenty of wasteland on the mountain. The reasoning you mentioned has also been talked about here in the past two years.

Du Hongjiang, 22 years old, completed five years of primary school. When I talked to him, a few young men interrupted, saying that his parents were looking for a bride for him. In the morning, the township party secretary told me that arranged marriages still account for a significant proportion here. So, I asked Du Hongjiang about his views on marriage. He said—

Marriage still depends on parents. First, economically, we rely on them. In our place, young people can only become economically independent after marriage; second, without parents, it is difficult to find a partner because there is little interaction with the outside world; third, parents' chosen partner cannot be rejected, otherwise, it would be disrespectful. Parents raised us with great difficulty, and everything, including our lives, is given by them, so how can we not listen to them? My parents have prepared everything for my marriage, and I only need to manage the family's production well, and it will be very relaxed.

Sitting quietly in the corner was Chen Kaifu, 50 years old, living on an even higher mountain. In the afternoon, when we were climbing the mountain, he was ahead of us, carrying several dozen jin of potato seeds on the unrecognizable mountain path, step by step up the mountain. He rested midway, and we got to know each other. Now, he stayed here because it was dark and the road was dangerous. I chatted with him about his family. He said—

There are 8 people in my family, 6 children. The oldest girl is 17 years old, and the youngest is 1 year old. We contracted 12 mu of land, mainly planting potatoes, corn, and beans. Potatoes yield more than 30,000 jin a year. After keeping enough for food, the rest is all fed to the pigs. Every year, we raise 15 pigs, but there is no way to transport them down the mountain. Even if we transport them down the mountain, the money from selling them is not enough to cover the transportation costs. The 15 pigs can only be slaughtered and eaten. The whole year has almost no vegetables, just potatoes and pork. In addition, we can harvest about 1,000 jin of beans, which can be exchanged for nearly 600 jin of rice. Usually, we eat fresh food.

It was past 11 at night. The mountain rain was getting heavier, and the sound of the stream was getting louder. Some Qiang people who couldn't bear the fatigue had quietly left, and I was also exhausted from the day's mountain journey...

### 碉楼夜话

　　碉楼夜话
    本报记者  龚金星
    四川茂县白溪乡，在大山深处。为识羌族独特的碉楼真面目，我们在这里停车。从乡政府出发，爬山半小时，即入白溪寨。６７岁的羌族老人周巷成把我们迎进了他家的碉楼里。他告诉我们，这座碉楼相传好几百年了。
    羌族人民“依山居业，垒石为室”。以石块石片作原料，黄泥为粘合剂，建造碉楼碉房，是每个羌民的拿手好戏。施工时，他们不绘图、不吊线，也不用柱架支撑，而是凭艺术想象，信手而来。这种房子不仅坚固耐久，而且经多次地震不塌。碉楼通常分为三层，底层关牲口，中层住人，最上层储存粮食、物品等。
    一日白溪游，流连忘返，不觉暮色苍茫。此时，山雨点点。两个多小时的山路，也有些腰酸腿痛了，我们便在一个名叫“下杜”的寨子里歇下。
    赶巧，寨里的杜洪全家新碉楼完工。晚上，村里的男女老少到杜家饮“咂酒”，以示庆贺。杜洪全来请我们。作为远方客人，在男女老少边歌边舞中，我们饮了第一口酒。
    饮完咂酒，在火塘边坐定。村民们围着我们聊了起来：
    陈开宇，３５岁。作为一村之长，他和我摆的第一个话题，是寨子里的那所小学。显然，这是村民们关心的热点。他说——
    下杜，１９７４年开始有学校，１９８３年撤销，原因是上边认为学校太多了。从此，寨里的小孩只得到１０里外的乡中心小学读书。小孩走不了１０多里路不说，还要过两座吊桥，家长也放心不下，读书的在寨子里快绝迹了。我是铁了心，逼老二去上学，可是读了两年，识不下２０多个字。原来他并没有在学校上过几天课，每天只是走到中途，就往回赶，边走边耍，太阳下山时，刚好回到家里。寨子里百几号人，没个读书的，急呀。大家一咬牙，凑钱，第一次凑５００元，用来做了课桌２０多张。不久，又凑起了第二个５００元，为聘来的老师添炊具，修理教室门窗。１９８６年终于恢复了学校，１０多名学龄儿童，放下羊鞭，背上了书包。到现在，有学生２２名，分一、二两个年级，一位老师上课。
    我们山里人认准一个理，不读书，跟山外人的差距会越来越大。为争取学校合法，我跑了好几趟县文教局，就是得不到承认。因此，学校的每一分开支都靠几十户村民自筹。尽管我们在尽最大努力，但总是有些难以承受。
    陈聪莲，３５岁，五个孩子（四男一女）的妈妈。在下杜，像她这样年纪，有五、六个孩子的为数不少。我和她说起计划生育的好处。她说——
    我也不想生这么多，儿多母苦呀。但我们这里天高皇帝远，没有几个儿子，是要受欺负的。若有个什么争执吵闹，腰杆子也硬不起来。再者，没有几个儿子，也富不起来。这上山下山是没路的路，一年少说也有好几千斤东西背上背下，没有男人也不行啊。虽然地少，山上有的是荒可开。你讲的这些道理，我们这里这两年也在说。
    杜洪江，２２岁，读过小学五年级。我和他搭话时，几个小伙子打岔，说他父母正在给他找媳妇。上午，乡党委书记告诉我，这里父母包办婚姻还占相当大的比例。于是，我问起了杜洪江的婚姻观。他说——
    结婚，还是要靠父母。一是经济上要靠他们。我们这里的年轻人一般只有结婚后，才有可能经济独立；二是不靠父母也很难找到对象，原因是平时与外界交往很少；三是父母物色的对象，不能不愿意，否则就是不孝顺。父母把我们养大不容易，自己的一切包括生命都是父母给的，怎么能不听他们的？我的父母已为我备齐了一切结婚费用，我除了把家里的生产搞好外，很轻松。
    坐在一角不吭声的是陈开福，５０岁，家在另一座更高的山上。下午，我们在往山上爬时，他在我们前头，在不成其为路的山道上，背着几十公斤马铃薯种，一步一步往山上挪，中途休息时，我们就认识了。此时，他因天黑路险，留宿在此。我和他拉起家常。他说——
    家里８口人，６个小孩，最大的女孩１７岁，最小的１岁。承包了１２亩地，主要种马铃薯、玉米、胡豆。马铃薯一年收３万多斤，除留足口粮外，余下全部喂猪。每年养猪１５头，没办法运下山来，即使运下山了，卖的钱，还不够运费。１５头猪只能杀来吃，一年到头没什么蔬菜，只是马铃薯加猪肉。此外，能收千把斤胡豆，可换回将近６００斤大米，平常吃个新鲜。
    夜１１点多了。山雨越下越大，山涧流水，越来越响。有些耐不住疲倦的羌胞已悄悄离去，毕竟走了一天山路，我也困顿不堪了……
