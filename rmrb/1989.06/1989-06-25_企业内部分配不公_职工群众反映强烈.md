Workers in some enterprises in Huaihua, Hunan Province, have strongly expressed their dissatisfaction with the issue of inequitable internal distribution.

According to the Huaihua Regional Office, a recent survey of 50 enterprises in the region by relevant departments revealed that the problem of inequitable internal distribution is prominent:

First, the bonuses for factory directors (managers) are excessively high, creating a significant disparity with workers' bonuses. In 50% of these 50 enterprises, the bonuses for factory directors (managers) are 4 to 10 times higher than those of workers, while in the remaining 50% of enterprises, the bonuses for factory directors (managers) are generally 2 to 3 times higher than those of workers. For example, in Jingzhou Autonomous County's Timber Company, the bonuses for leaders and middle-level cadres in 1988 amounted to 90,000 yuan, with each person receiving several thousand yuan, while workers received nothing.

Second, bonuses for frontline production workers are deducted layer by layer. Some enterprises allocate job-based salaries and job-based bonuses to anyone with a "rank" or "title," and also grant the contractors the authority to distribute workers' salaries and bonuses. However, some contractors, in order to earn more for themselves, find various ways to deduct workers' salaries and bonuses. For instance, in Hongjiang Paper Mill, the bonuses for production workers are deducted layer by layer, resulting in an average annual income of only 1,800 yuan per worker.

Third, in the distribution of bonuses, a practice of "red envelopes" and secrecy is adopted. In 70% of these 50 enterprises, the reward schemes are decided by a few responsible individuals, and the amount of bonuses each person receives is kept secret from the workers.

It is understood that the issue of inequitable internal distribution in some enterprises in Huaihua has become a significant problem affecting the development of the enterprises and local stability and harmony.

### 企业内部分配不公  职工群众反映强烈

　　企业内部分配不公  职工群众反映强烈
    湖南省怀化地区部分企业的职工对企业内部分配不公的问题反映强烈。
    据怀化行署办公室反映，该地区有关部门最近对５０家企业的调查发现，目前，企业内部分配不公问题突出：
    一、厂长（经理）承包奖过高，与职工奖金悬殊。这５０家企业５０％的企业厂长（经理）的奖金是职工奖金的４至１０倍，另外５０％的企业的厂长（经理）的奖金大多也为职工的２至３倍。如：靖州自治县木材公司１９８８年领导和中层干部的奖金９万元，每人数千元，而职工分文未得。
    二、层层克扣生产第一线工人的奖金。一些企业对凡是有“衔”带“长”的，都确定了职务工资和职务奖金，同时还赋予承包人工资、奖金分配大权，而一些承包人为了自己多拿钱，千方百计克扣工人的工资和奖金。如：洪江造纸厂生产工人的奖金被层层“剥皮”，工人年人均收入仅１８００元。
    三、在奖金分配上实行封“红包”，神秘化。这５０家企业中７０％的企业的奖励方案是由少数几个负责人商定，谁拿多少奖金，职工一概不知。
    据了解，怀化地区部分企业内部分配不公的问题已成为影响企业发展和当地安定团结的重要问题。
