From April 1 this year, grain markets in various parts of Jiangxi province have reopened. Grain transactions have been active, and by May 25, the grain department had already purchased 100 million kilograms of negotiated grain.

According to statistics from 28 key grain and oil markets in the province for April, the price of rice per 100 kilograms was 131.93 yuan, an increase of 1.6%, and the price of early indica rice per 100 kilograms was 85.92 yuan, an increase of 0.79%. The slight increase in grain prices is due to the current period of green and yellow crops, where farmers have a tendency to hold back on selling, some grain merchants engage in illegal reselling, and the grain department fears grain outflow, thus raising the purchase price. However, the price of grain sold to other provinces remains stable with a slight decrease. The grain market at the border, which has been strictly controlled, is now particularly active.

Jiangxi is one of the major rice-producing areas in China. Last year, grain production decreased by 250 million kilograms, and the negotiated purchase portion was reduced by 75 million kilograms compared to previous years. To ensure the local population's grain supply and prevent grain merchants from hoarding, Jiangxi closed its grain markets after completing the state procurement task by the end of July last year. This year, during the period of green and yellow crops, the grain market reopened, allowing grain to be freely exchanged. The supply-demand contradiction in grain-deficient areas has been somewhat alleviated. Farmers who went out to buy grain have returned to their hometowns to purchase grain locally, and some commercial departments have found a place to buy grain. Farmers have some cash after selling negotiated grain. The grain price in Jiangxi's grain market follows the market, but it cannot exceed the highest limit price of 2 yuan per kilogram. The negotiated purchase price in the main grain-producing areas has slightly increased, while the grain price in grain-deficient areas has decreased, with rice dropping from 1.4 yuan per kilogram to 1.36 yuan. After approval by the grain department, market grain can also be sold to other provinces, with 50 million kilograms sold to provinces and cities such as Fujian, Guangzhou, Yunnan, and Shanghai in the first 25 days of May alone.

According to reports from some grain-producing counties visited by the reporter, the grain market is not fully open, and in some places, farmers cannot engage in inter-county transactions after completing the state procurement and negotiated conversion tasks. There are still various checkpoints at the border. Most farmers hope that in the future, after completing the state procurement task, they will have more freedom to buy and sell.

　　江西重开粮食市场    
    成交活跃各地粮价普遍趋向合理  仍有关卡农民希望渠道更加畅通
    本报记者毕月华报道：从今年４月１日起，江西各地集贸粮食市场重又开放。粮食成交活跃，截至５月２５日止，粮食部门已收购议价粮１亿公斤。
    据全省２８个重点粮油市场４月份的统计，大米每百公斤１３１．９３元，上升１．６％，籼稻每百公斤８５．９２元，上升０．７９％。粮价略有上升的原因是，目前正值青黄不接，农户有惜售思想，一些粮贩非法进行倒卖活动，粮食部门怕粮食外流，提高了收购价格。但销往外省的粮价稳中有降。一向控制甚严的边界粮食市场，目前分外活跃。
    江西为我国主要产米区之一，去年粮食减产２．５亿公斤，议购部分比往年减少７５００万公斤。为保证本省群众用粮和防止粮贩套购，从去年７月底完成定购任务后，江西即关闭了粮食市场。今年青黄不接之际，粮食集贸市场重新开放，使粮食可以自由交流，缺粮地区的供需矛盾有所缓和，外出购粮的缺粮户纷纷返回家乡就地购买，一些工商部门的用粮有了买处，农民卖出议价粮后手头有了活钱。江西粮食市场粮价随行就市，但不得超过每公斤２元的最高限价。粮食主产区的议购价格稍升，缺粮区粮价却下跌，大米由每公斤１．４元降到１．３６元。经粮食部门审批后，集市粮食也可运销外省，仅５月头２５天就销往福建、广州、云南、上海等省市５０００万公斤。
    据记者到过的一些产粮县反映，粮食市场开放程度不够，一些地方农户在完成定购和议转平任务后，仍不能进行跨县买卖，边界处仍设有种种关卡。大多数农民希望今后在完成国家定购任务后，有更多的买卖自由。
