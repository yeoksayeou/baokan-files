Laos Holds National Assembly Session, Fongsamouane Elected Chairman

	Vientiane, May 31 (Xinhua) — The second session of the second National Assembly of Laos opened in Vientiane on May 30. Acting President Phoumi Vongvichit presided over the meeting. Kaysone Phomvihane, General Secretary of the Lao People's Revolutionary Party and Chairman of the Council of Ministers, delivered a lengthy speech at the session.

	Kaysone said that the current trend in international relations is moving from tension to relaxation, from confrontation to dialogue, and that competition and cooperation coexist in peaceful coexistence.

	He noted, "After 30 years of tension, the leaders of the Soviet Union and China recently held their first meeting and talks, deciding to normalize relations between the two countries. This event not only serves the interests of the peoples of the Soviet Union and China but is also a major contribution to peace, friendship, and cooperation in Asia-Pacific and the world."

	Kaysone expressed that Laos will strive to improve relations with China, and the two countries will develop trade and economic cooperation on a mutually beneficial basis.

	On the issue of Cambodia, Kaysone reiterated Laos' support for Vietnam's position, claiming that the withdrawal of Vietnamese troops must be simultaneous with the cessation of military aid to various Cambodian factions and the exclusion of the anti-Vietnamese resistance forces of the Khmer People's National Liberation Front.
