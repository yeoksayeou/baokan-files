	You Get the Fame, I Get the Profit
		—Discussing Issues in Product Awards

	Last year, the National Food Expo was a bustling event with over 5,000 products recommended for awards. An astonishing 4,957 products were awarded gold, silver, or bronze medals. It was revealed that to participate in this evaluation where the "quality product rate" exceeded 90%, each product had to pay a 300 yuan evaluation fee. Many enterprises also paid varying amounts of sponsorship fees. Just from the evaluation fees alone, the organizers collected 1.5 million yuan.

	Even more shocking, a month after the Expo closed, several enterprises from a remote province, whose products had neither been exhibited nor evaluated, wanted to obtain a quality label just for the sake of it. They negotiated with the organizers using money, and surprisingly, they succeeded.

	The practice of "buying quality" did not start with the Food Expo. The media had previously exposed the "Ziwei Cup" white wine evaluation, which occurred earlier. It was reported that each participating product had to pay several thousand yuan in fees. In the absence of most white wine factories, the few dozen that eagerly participated all won the "Ziwei Cup."

	Even more astonishing is that some products' quality ratings were determined by how much money the enterprises paid. In a certain evaluation in Henan, two products with the same name were initially rated as gold and silver awards. Upon learning this preliminary evaluation result, the manager of the product rated as silver immediately convened an emergency meeting, instructing his public relations personnel: "Even if it costs 200,000 yuan, we must secure the gold award." Sure enough, when the evaluation results were announced, this product was listed among the gold award winners.

	In an evaluation organized by a certain department, a "key" product from a certain region did not make the "golden list" in the initial evaluation. The administrative official in charge of this region scolded the organizers for being "incompetent," instructing them to "send more samples and increase their 'understanding'." The organizers, understanding the implication, went all out, and the outcome was predictable.

	Why can money buy quality? This is closely related to the motives of many organizers of these evaluations. This award or that award, this quality or that quality, this best or that best, this cup or that cup... In reality, many organizers simply want you to pay, and they will evaluate; you get the fame, and they get the profit. It is revealed that in a certain region's quality product exhibition and evaluation, the income from two nights alone was several million yuan; to compete for the "Best After-Sales Service Cup," each enterprise had to pay tens of millions of yuan...

	The media's exposure of 13 famous beer factories jointly boycotting the "National Top Ten Beers" evaluation sparked a strong social reaction because it reflected the majority of enterprises' aversion to evaluations and expressed the discontent of many consumers with these "quality" products.

### 你获名　我得利——谈产品评优中的问题

　　你获名　我得利    
    ——谈产品评优中的问题
    新华社记者  杨理科
    去年末热闹过一阵子的全国食品博览会，有５０００多种展品被推荐参加评奖，获得金、银、铜牌奖的产品竟达４９５７种。据介绍，原来在这“优质品率”高达９０％以上的评比背后，却是参评产品必须交纳３００元的评奖费，不少企业还交了数额不等的各种名目的赞助费。仅评奖费一项主办者就收了１５０万元。
    更有甚者，在这个博览会闭幕一个月后，某边远省区的几个企业产品既未参展，又未参评，但也想捞个名优牌子过过瘾，于是就用钱与主办者“接洽协商”，最后竟然如愿以偿。
    “以钱买优”的始作俑者并非食品博览会，报纸披露过的“紫薇杯”白酒评比就在其前。据称，那次白酒评比每个参评品种须交纳数千元费用，在多数白酒厂未参加的情况下，“踊跃”报名的二三十家白酒厂统统捧回了“紫薇杯”。
    更让人惊诧的是有些产品的优质等级竟是根据企业交钱多少论定的。河南某地两个名称相同的产品，在某次评比的预评中一个定为金质奖，另一个定为银质奖。得知这一预评消息，被定为银质奖的那个工厂的厂长立即召开紧急会议，对他的公关人员下达指令：哪怕花上２０万，也要拿到金质奖。果然，公布评比结果时，这一产品赫然列入金质奖名册。
    在一次某部举办的评优中，初评时一地区的“重点”产品未能“金榜题名”。这一地区的主管行政长官斥责承办人“不会办事”，指示“再多送几车样品去，让每个评委增加‘了解’”。承办人心领神会，放手去干，最后的结局当然可想而知了。
    为什么掏钱就能买到优呢？这同不少评优活动举办者的动机密切相关。这奖那奖、这优那优、这佳那佳、这杯那杯……实际上不少举办者无非是你掏钱，我评优；你获名，我得利。据透露，某地区的优质产品展评会，两个晚上的收入便是几百万；争一个“最佳售后服务杯”，每个企业就得拿出数十万……
    新闻界曾披露的１３家名优啤酒厂联合抵制“全国十佳啤酒”评比一事，之所以引起强烈的社会反响，因为它反映了多数企业厌“评”心理，也表达了众多消费者厌“优”情绪。
