The Flow of Love in the Desert

In the vast desert, there is such a small stream:
Like a seed sprouting, breaking through the dark underworld; like a silkworm spinning silk, originating from numerous fine sand springs. Carrying the deep emotions and longings of the sand springs, it sets off from the boundless desert, quietly sets off.

The desert is endless, the journey is far.
There is no path beneath its feet. There are no birds in the sky.
The horizon is boundless, monotonous and vast, with only a streak of yellow from the desert, a streak of blue from the sky, and a blazing sun. This is an abstract painting. To pass through the painting, it must endure the sun's layer upon layer of scorching. The method of scorching is evaporation under high temperatures. The sun is so greedy, as if it wants to devour it in one gulp. But it, like a bleeding soldier, even if lagging behind, does not give up on life. With a desire to live, it grits its teeth and slowly crawls forward...

It seems to be not just for survival.
There is no babbling of mountain streams, no singing of river currents, only the philosopher's silent journey, deep in thought. It believes: as long as the sand springs do not dry up, there is hope ahead; as long as the will does not falter, life is eternal. Thus, it endures the sun's greedy scorching, unyielding and unyielding, moving forward.

One day, I followed its flow, searching and praying: if I were the sun, I would not be so greedy, but would borrow a shadow of clouds to cast a cool shade for it. However, I am not the sun, nor can I borrow anything. I can only sing for it with all my heart—

In the vast desert, there is such a small stream:
Like a flash of lightning that never disappears, it tears through the darkness of the desolate wilderness; like a plowshare that never turns back, it travels day and night, covering one journey after another, plowing a line of life's scenery.

The path gradually widens. It now has its own riverbed and shallow banks. On the banks grow three-leaf green grass, two-petal yellow flowers, and a lost white bird. Unfortunately, there are no people, no songs, no barking herdsmen's dogs. Tall sand dunes still stand on both sides of it. The only thing that accompanies it day and night is the deep love of the flowing sand. The love of the flowing sand is sincere but selfish. So it reaches out to detain it, spreading a soft bed of emotions to seep into it. This detainment and seepage is a great consumption, even more than the sun's evaporation. It realizes that this is a bottomless pit, so it makes up its mind to break through, enduring a soft emotional friction. It continues to walk alone towards the front.

One day, I followed its flow, searching and praying: if I were the flowing sand, I would not be so selfish, but would borrow a piece of clay to lay a leak-proof riverbed for it. However, I am not the flowing sand, nor can I borrow anything. I can only respectfully praise it—

In the vast desert, there is such a small stream:
Enduring the sun's hellish torment, parting with the flowing sand's deep love, it walks, walks resolutely. Although the journey is difficult, it is unyielding. Walking forward seems to be its innate instinct. Walking forward, crossing the desert, crossing itself, finally walking out the name written in the wilderness—Desert Flow.

This is a name that cannot be found in the dictionary, a name that the ancients have never seen. But who dares to say it is fabricated?!

One day, I followed the Desert Flow and suddenly found myself in a lush oasis.

Desert Flow, is this lush oasis the revenge of your hatred, or the destination of your love?

"No!" the Desert Flow murmurs, as if telling me, "Do you not see that beyond the oasis, there are ten acres of grain fields; beyond the grain fields, there are a hundred acres of pastures; beyond the pastures, there are thousands of ships competing on the rivers; beyond the rivers, there are ten thousand waves on the sea..."

　　爱的漠流
    全秉荣
    大漠里，有这样一条小溪流：
    像种子爆芽，顶破冥冥地府；若春蚕吐丝，源于纤细而众多的沙泉。带着沙泉的幽情夙愿，它从浩瀚的沙漠中出发了，悄然出发了。
    大漠漫漫，征途遥遥。
    脚下没有路。天上没有鸟。
    视野无涯，单调而空旷，只见大漠的一抹黄，长天的一抹蓝，还有一轮烈焰灼灼的太阳。这是一幅抽象派的画。要从画中穿过，它就得几经太阳的层层盘剥。盘剥的方式，便是高温下的火烧火燎的蒸发。太阳真贪婪，仿佛要一口吞噬了它。而它，倒像一位滴血不止的战士，纵然落伍，并不甘心死亡。怀着生的欲望，它咬紧牙关，缓缓地向前爬呀爬……
    好像不仅仅是为了生存。
    没有山溪的潺潺诗吟，没有田流的哗哗歌唱，只有哲人的一路缄默，一路沉思。它坚信：沙泉不竭，前程有望；信念不倒，生命永恒。就这样，它经过太阳的贪婪盘剥，不屈不挠地向前走去。
    那一天，我顺着它的流向，一边追寻，一边祈愿：假如我是太阳，绝不如此贪婪，而要借来一片云影，为它投下一道清凉。然而，我不是太阳，也无法借来什么，我只为它潜心歌唱——
    大漠里，有这样一条小溪流：
    仿佛一道永不消失的闪电，划破了荒漠绝域的黑暗；宛若一支永不回头的犁铧，晓行夜也行，走了一程又一程，犁开了一条生命的风景线。
    道路渐渐变宽。它已有了自己的河床、浅浅的堤岸。岸边长出三叶青草，两瓣黄花，还有一只迷路的白色鸟。可惜没有人，没有歌，没有汪汪的牧狗叫。高大的沙丘依然耸立在它的两岸。与它朝夕相伴的，只有流沙的一往深情。流沙的爱是真挚而自私的。于是便伸手挽留它，铺开绵绵的床垫与感情渗漏它。这种挽留与渗漏，是一种巨大的消耗，以至于要胜过太阳的蒸发的消耗。它意识到，这是一个无底的陷井，便横下一条心撞过去，撞过了一个感情上的软磨擦。它又向着前方踽踽独行了。
    那一天，我顺着它的流向，一边追寻，一边祈愿：假如我是流沙，绝不如此自私，而要借来一方粘土，为它铺设一道毫不渗漏的河床。然而，我不是流沙，也不会借来什么，我只为它钦敬地礼赞——
    大漠里，有这样一条小溪流：
    忍了太阳的炼狱之苦，别了流沙的倾心相爱，它走，执著地走。尽管步履维艰，依然义无返顾。向前走，仿佛是它与生俱来的本能。向前走，走过大漠，走过自我，终于走出了大写在荒野上的名字——漠流。
    这是一个辞典里查不着、先人们未见过的名字。但，谁敢说，它是生造的呢？！
    那一天，我顺着漠流走下去，蓦然间，走进一片生命的绿洲。
    漠流呵漠流，这茵茵的绿洲，该是你恨的报复，还是爱的归宿？
    “不！”漠流淙淙，仿佛告诉我，“君不见，绿洲那边，还有十顷粮田；粮田那边，还有百里牧场；牧场那边，还有江河的千帆竞发；江河那边，还有大海的万顷波涛……”
