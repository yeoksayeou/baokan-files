Salvador's New President Takes Oath of Office
Expresses Intent to Govern by Rule of Law

A reporter from our newspaper in Mexico City reports: Today, 41-year-old coffee plantation owner Alfredo Cristiani took office as the President of the Republic of El Salvador for a term of five years.

According to Mexico's television station, Cristiani stated during his inauguration that his government will adhere to the principles of freedom, integrity, the rule of law, and security in governing the country. He criticized the previous government for plunging the nation into a serious political and economic crisis and accused the "National Liberation Movement" of being a "terrorist movement." However, he announced his intention to seek dialogue with the Farabundo Martí National Liberation Front (FMLN) guerrilla forces to achieve domestic peace through democratic processes. Nevertheless, he emphasized that the offer of dialogue does not signify government weakness.

Cristiani was nominated by the far-right Nationalist Republican Alliance and won the election in March. At that time, out of 1.8 million registered voters, only 900,000 cast their ballots, with Cristiani receiving 54% of the votes, which actually amounted to only 27% of the registered voters. The new government will face a very severe situation. On one hand, the ongoing civil war for over nine years has resulted in 70,000 deaths and forced over 1.2 million people to flee their homes, nearly a quarter of the country's population. Social contradictions are extremely sharp. On the other hand, the "middle forces" supported by the United States for many years suffered a defeat in the election, and there are doubts about the human rights record of the extreme right-wing government.

Since his victory, Cristiani has refused to engage with the guerrilla forces, stating that his government can only accept the "surrender" of the "rebel forces," not negotiations. Therefore, the guerrilla forces started disrupting transportation and energy supplies from midnight today, cutting off 90% of the country's urban and rural transportation, in protest of the new government.

Today, only the presidents of Costa Rica, Honduras, and Guatemala were invited to attend Cristiani's inauguration ceremony.

### 萨尔瓦多新总统宣誓就职  表示以法制原则治理国家

　　萨尔瓦多新总统宣誓就职
    表示以法制原则治理国家
    本报墨西哥城６月１日电  记者郭伟成报道：４１岁的咖啡庄园主阿尔弗雷多·克里斯蒂亚尼今天就任萨尔瓦多共和国总统，任期５年。
    据墨西哥电视台报道，克里斯蒂亚尼在就职时声称，他的政府将恪守自由、廉洁、法制与安全的原则治理国家。他批评前政府执政期间国家陷于严重的政治、经济危机；指责“民族主义解放运动”是“恐怖主义运动”。但是，他宣布将谋求与游击队法拉本多·马蒂民族解放阵线“对话”，争取通过民主进程实现国内和平。不过，他强调说，提出对话并不表示政府的软弱。
    克里斯蒂亚尼是由极右翼的民族主义共和联盟推举为总统候选人，在今年３月大选中获胜的。当时，全国１８０万登记选民只有９０万人投票，克里斯蒂亚尼得票５４％，实际仅占选民数的２７％。新政府将面临十分严峻的形势。一方面，持续９年多的内战造成７万人死亡，１２０多万人背井离乡，流亡他邦，几乎占全国人口的１／４。各种社会矛盾异常尖锐。另一方面，美国多年扶植的“中间力量”大选败北，对于在人权方面有不光彩纪录的极右派执政，也抱有疑虑。
    克里斯蒂亚尼获胜以来拒绝与游击队接触，声称他的政府只能接受“反叛力量”的“投降”，而不是谈判。因此，游击队从今天零点起发动对交通与能源的破坏，断绝了全国９０％的城乡交通，抵制新政府。
    今天，只有哥斯达黎加、洪都拉斯与危地马拉三国总统应邀出席克里斯蒂亚尼的就职仪式。
