Following the Clues to Uncover the Truth
— New Developments in the Johnson Case Investigation

Johnson Planned to Cover Up the Truth in Seoul

Canadian athlete Johnson, after handing over his 100-meter gold medal in Seoul, had conspired with his accomplices to cover up the truth about his use of anabolic steroids. This was revealed by Johnson's doctor, Astafiev, at a hearing in Toronto on the 29th. In the Hilton Hotel in Seoul, Johnson, along with his coach Francis and doctor Astafiev, met for the first time to discuss their strategy. They decided to cover up the facts and protect Johnson. Later, on the flight from Seoul to New York, Johnson and Astafiev discussed their strategy again. Astafiev said that Johnson was very afraid of publicly admitting he had taken drugs and expressed his intention to hide the truth and never admit it until the matter was settled.

Astafiev Refuses to Reveal the Source of the Banned Substance

Johnson's doctor, Astafiev, refused to disclose who provided the anabolic steroids given to Johnson and other athletes. During his testimony, Astafiev admitted that in June 1985, he exchanged 48 bottles of synthetic anabolic steroids for B-12 with a German Democratic Republic athlete. However, he refused to name the person who gave him the steroids, stating that he had received threats that his family members would be harmed.

Although Astafiev did not explain the "threats," what drew people's interest was the 48 bottles of banned substances. Astafiev and others insisted that the anabolic steroids they gave Johnson were different from the ones Johnson was found to have used in his urine test in Seoul last year.

　　顺藤摸瓜  查清事实
    ——约翰逊事件的调查又有新进展
    约翰逊在汉城就打算掩盖真相
    加拿大运动员约翰逊在汉城交出他的百米金牌后，曾和他的同谋策划如何掩盖其服用类固醇的真相。这是约翰逊的医生阿斯塔芬２９日在多伦多听证会上披露的。在汉城的希尔顿饭店，约翰逊及其教练弗朗西斯、医生阿斯塔芬首次碰头研究对策，决定掩盖事实真相，保护约翰逊。此后，在汉城至纽约的飞机上，约翰逊又同阿斯塔芬再次商量对策。阿斯塔芬说，约翰逊很害怕公开承认自己吃药，并表示要隐瞒到底，绝不承认，直到此事平息为止。
    　　　　阿斯塔芬拒绝透露禁药来源
    约翰逊的医生阿斯塔芬３０日拒绝披露，他是从谁手里得到提供给约翰逊和其他选手的那种类固醇药的。阿斯塔芬在作证时承认，他于１９８５年６月用Ｂ—１２与一位民主德国选手换了４８瓶合成类固醇。但他拒绝说出换给他类固醇者的人名，他说，这是由于他受到了有人将对他的家属下毒手的威胁。
    尽管阿斯塔芬没有对“威胁”作任何解释，但引起人们兴趣的却是这４８瓶禁药，因为，阿斯塔芬等人坚持说，他们给约翰逊的那种类固醇，同约翰逊去年在汉城尿样检验中被查出的那种类固醇不一样。
