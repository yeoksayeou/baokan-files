	An Unconquerable Spirit
	– A Profile of Wang Jia Kui, Star of "Under the Same Blue Sky"

	People's Daily reporter Wu Huo

	Seeing Wang Jia Kui holding the highest award of the 1989 China International Sports Festival, the "International Image Grand Prize," I was moved to tears. This handsome man had finally proven his words: "Everyone can see my disabled limbs, but no one can see my heart that can never be conquered."

	I have known Wang Jia Kui for a long time. Before he won the gold medal in the men's 100-meter backstroke at the Third World Games for the Disabled in the United States in 1984 and set a new world record, I already knew of this remarkable figure from Baoding.

	There are three reasons why he became famous. First, his appearance. With thick eyebrows, big eyes, curly hair, and a sturdy build, he resembles the character Raju from the Indian film "The Vagabond." Second, his fiery temper. The physical disabilities of the disabled often lead to a natural psychological defense and heightened self-esteem. Since losing his right leg to osteomyelitis at the age of 14, he has frequently resorted to violence when his self-esteem is hurt. Third, his experiences. After graduating from middle school, he had to fend for himself, selling vegetables, taking photos, repairing cars, and selling clothes. Various hardships have made him taste the bittersweetness of life.

	All these past experiences not only became valuable assets in his life journey but also provided rich material for the protagonist in "Under the Same Blue Sky." It was also one of the main reasons why director Li Shu'an from the Beijing Film Academy chose him to lead the cast. Wang Jia Kui is not satisfied with just surviving; he yearns for recognition from society. He loves the lyrics from "The Internationale": "There has never been a savior, nor gods or emperors." To achieve his goals, he has paid a tremendous price.

	In 1982, the Third Far East and South Pacific Games for the Disabled were held in Hong Kong. He signed up for the domestic selection trials for swimming. Through hard work and early preparation, Wang Jia Kui achieved his goal and was selected as a member of the delegation. During the competition, he fell off the starting platform, dislocating his arm, but he popped it back in and immediately continued the race, winning a bronze medal.

	Wang Jia Kui himself is a disabled person. He understands the plight and thoughts of all disabled people. He did not rest on his laurels. In late 1988, he established the Baoding branch of the Hebei Kanglong Company, a disabled enterprise, hiring dozens of disabled people from cities and villages, and began his journey as an entrepreneur. Now, their company's McStick cleaning wax paper towels are bestsellers nationwide and are even exported overseas. A group of previously unknown disabled people finally saw their own value and gained recognition from society.

	The path from athlete to actor to entrepreneur is not easy for anyone, and it is even more challenging for a disabled person.

	Under the same blue sky, people should enjoy the same rights and the same honors. I sincerely hope that his unconquerable heart will forever remain young, pursuing and achieving new futures.

    不能征服的心
    ——记《同在蓝天下》的主演王家奎
    本报记者　吴骅
    看着王家奎捧着1989年中国国际体育节最高奖“国际影像联大奖”奖杯时激动的情景，我的视线模糊了。这个仪表堂堂的男子汉终于用行动实践了自己的誓言：“谁都能看到我残疾的肢体，但谁也无法看到我永远不能被征服的心。”
    我和王家奎是老相识了，在他1984年获得在美国举行的第三届世界伤残人奥运会上夺得男子100米仰泳金牌，并刷新该项世界纪录之前，我就知道保定市有这么个风云人物。
    之所以成名，原因有三。第一是他的相貌。浓眉大眼、曲卷的头发、健壮敦实的身体，酷像印度电影《流浪者》中的拉兹。第二是他火爆的脾气。伤残人生理上的缺陷造成心理上一种自然的防范警觉性，自尊心极强。自从14岁因骨髓炎截去右腿之后，他多次因自尊心受到伤害而“动武”。第三是他的遭遇。为了生存，中学毕业后他开始自谋生路，卖菜、照相、修汽车、卖服装……各种坎坷的经历使他饱尝了人生的酸辣苦甜咸。
    过去的一切不仅成为他在人生道路上宝贵的积累，而且成为《同在蓝天下》主人公人物不可多得的素材。同样也是北影导演李淑安选中他领衔的主要原因之一。王家奎不满足于生存，他渴望得到社会的承认。他最喜欢《国际歌》中“从来就没有什么救世主，也不靠神仙皇帝”这句歌词，为实现自己的目标，他付出了超人的代价。
    1982年，第三届远东及南太平洋地区伤残人运动会在香港举行，他报名参加了游泳的国内选拔赛。刻苦的努力，及早的准备，王家奎如愿以偿，入选为代表团成员。比赛时，他从起跳台上摔了下来，胳膊脱臼，但他接上后马上投入比赛，竟然夺得了一枚铜牌。
    王家奎自己是个残疾人，他理解所有残疾人的苦衷和想法，他没有满足自己的成功。1988年底，他创办了保定市残疾人企业——河北康隆公司保定分公司，招收了城市、乡村的几十名伤残人，开始了一个企业家的奋斗。如今，他们公司生产的麦斯蒂克清洁蜡纸巾已成为畅销全国、远销海外的产品。一批默默无闻的残疾人终于看到了自身的价值，得到了社会的承认。
    运动员——演员——企业家的道路对一个人来说是不容易的，对一个残疾人来说其困难和挫折就更加不易。
    同在蓝天下，人们要享受同样的权利，也应该享受同样的荣誉。衷心地希望他那颗不可征服的心永远年轻，去追求和实现新的未来。
