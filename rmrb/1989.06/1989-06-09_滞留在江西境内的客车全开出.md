Recently, eleven trains that were successively delayed and stopped at various railway stations within Jiangxi Province have all departed.

During the period when the trains were delayed and stopped, local party committees and government leaders organized personnel to rush to the stations, providing tea, water, food, and medicine to the stranded passengers, ensuring the passengers' living conditions and safety. The passengers said, "It's still the Communist Party that's good!"
