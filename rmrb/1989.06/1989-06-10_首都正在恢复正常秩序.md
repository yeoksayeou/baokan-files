Today is the seventh day since the counter-revolutionary riot in Beijing was suppressed. The tense atmosphere that has enveloped the capital for a week is gradually easing, and social order is returning to normal.

This morning, reporters saw on their tour that the streets of Beijing, which had been quiet for several days, were once again bustling with people. There were noticeably more workers commuting by bicycle. At major intersections such as Dabeiying and Hujiayuan on the Third Ring Road, there were troops on duty or patrolling. Some soldiers from the People's Liberation Army and armed police, with the help of the public, were cleaning up debris and garbage on both sides of the streets. On the roads leading into the city, trucks carrying grain and vegetables were coming and going, and military trucks with "Grain Supply Vehicle" signs occasionally passed by.

It is understood that out of the city's 170 public bus routes, 166 have resumed operation. The number of buses in service today was significantly higher than yesterday, providing convenience for commuters. At the No. 9 bus stop, reporters saw that the waiting passengers were orderly.

On Wangfujing Street, most shops have reopened. Reporters saw that the Department Store and Dong'an Market had ample goods after reopening, and customers were leisurely selecting items. The sales staff were enthusiastically serving customers. The business departments and savings offices of banks that had reopened were busy. Most grain stores, vegetable stores, and food stores in the city and its suburbs had reopened.

With the resumption of public transportation, postal workers have begun delivering mail, sanitation workers are out cleaning up garbage, and factory attendance rates are gradually increasing. The Municipal Education Bureau has issued a notice requiring all primary and secondary schools in the city to resume classes by June 12 at the latest.

Reporters also learned that air and rail services have been basically normal in recent days. A passenger from Tianjin told reporters: "In Tianjin, I heard a lot of rumors about Beijing and was quite nervous. When I got out of the station, the scene was similar to usual, and taking a car was also very convenient. I feel much more at ease now."

　　首都正在恢复正常秩序
    本报北京６月１０日讯  今天是北京平息反革命暴乱的第七天，一周来笼罩着首都的紧张气氛逐渐缓和，社会秩序趋于正常。
    记者上午在采访中看到，冷清几天的北京街道重又人来人往，骑自行车上下班的职工明显见多；在大北窑、呼家楼等三环路主要路口，都有戒严部队在值勤或巡逻；还有一些解放军战士和武警战士在群众的协助下清理街道两旁的杂物和垃圾；在通往城里的一条条大道上，运粮运菜的车辆络绎不绝，不时有贴着“为民运粮车”字样的军车驶过。
    据了解，全市１７０条公共电汽车线路中已有１６６条恢复运营，今天投入运营的车辆比昨天明显增多，为上下班的乘客提供了方便。在９路公共汽车站，记者看到候车的乘客秩序井然。
    在王府井大街，大部分商店恢复营业。记者看到恢复营业后的百货大楼和东安市场内货物充足，顾客神情自在地挑选商品，售货员热情待客。开门的银行营业部、储蓄所业务繁忙。城近郊区的粮店、菜店、副食商店基本上都已开门营业。
    随着公共交通的恢复，邮政工人已开始投递信件，环卫工人上街清运垃圾，工厂的出勤率逐日提高。市教育局已发通知，要求全市所有中小学最迟于１２日正常上课。
    记者还了解到，近几天的民航航班和火车运行都基本正常。一位从天津来的乘客对记者说：“在天津听到很多关于北京的谣传，心情比较紧张。出站一看，景象与往常相似，坐车也很方便，心里踏实多了。”
