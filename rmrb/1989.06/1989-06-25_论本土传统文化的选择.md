In recent years, discussions about Chinese culture have garnered attention from scholars both domestically and internationally. Many scholars have eagerly shared their views, publishing articles and monographs, creating a wave of discussions on Chinese culture. One of the key issues is how to approach indigenous culture, particularly its traditional aspects, commonly referred to as "traditional culture." The concept of "traditional culture" has been mistakenly equated by some to the "heavy shackles" of China's historical legacy, while "Westernization" and modernization are seen as equivalent, placing Western culture in a position devoid of tradition. Due to the ambiguity of these concepts, traditional culture is viewed as backward and in need of abandonment, while foreign culture is seen as advanced, leading to calls for "complete Westernization." In reality, "tradition" should be synonymous with "modern" and "contemporary," and both indigenous and foreign cultures have their own traditions. When discussing attitudes towards China's indigenous traditional culture, some advocate for restoration, others for abandonment, and still others for selective treatment. Each perspective has its own merits, but there is no consensus. The crux of the matter lies in the lack of a thorough analysis of the meaning of "tradition."

I believe that "tradition" is a historical concept that continuously forms and develops in specific eras. It must be passed down, widely accepted, and continuously used. "Tradition" reflects social existence and is also a constantly changing social phenomenon. Any "tradition" is not singular; it is not simply good or bad but rather reflects the era from multiple sources, regions, dimensions, and layers. Therefore, "tradition" should not be seen solely as a harmful, conservative force, as it can also be a starting point for progress. Some view "tradition" as both a "burden" and a "treasure," which is a fair assessment.

If "tradition" is both a burden and a treasure, then the approach to traditional culture should not be based on subjective assumptions or emotional attachments, leading to either restoration and preservation or abandonment and severance. Instead, a cautious selection approach is necessary. Selection involves screening, eliminating, preserving, inheriting, and promoting, and integrating the chosen elements into the structure of new culture for the present and future. Since the Han and Wei dynasties, Chinese traditional culture has been formed through continuous creation of new cultural models. Even in modern times, this quest continues, such as the late Qing dynasty's "Chinese essence, Western application," which was a choice made after prolonged suffering. This slogan emerged in an era of continuous foreign invasions and had the political goal of patching up the feudal system. On one hand, it reluctantly accepted foreign objects seen as "strange and seductive" as "Western application," while on the other hand, it maintained the theoretical and institutional layers inherent in Chinese traditional culture as "Chinese essence." The result was that with the import of Western technological objects, Western political theories and organizational institutional models also unexpectedly came along, challenging the existing "Chinese essence." This cannot be dismissed as one of the sources of the democratic models during the Xinhai Revolution and the early Republic of China (though they were already distorted). In reality, "Chinese essence, Western application" did not contribute to the construction of modern new culture but only became a historical relic.

In the past few decades, the standard for selecting traditional culture has been "retaining the essence and discarding the dross," further interpreted as democratic essence and feudal dross. This standard had a significant impact and was convenient to use; however, it sometimes oversimplified traditional culture. If a simple either-or selection criterion is used, it does not align with reality. Firstly, it overlooks the existence of neutral culture (culture that is neither beneficial nor harmful), which indeed exists. Secondly, Chinese traditional culture was largely produced in a feudal context. If specific cultures are not analyzed and the feudal dross is generally discarded, it is easy to view Chinese history as a void, which is entirely contrary to historical existence.

Another standard for selecting traditional culture is the familiar "learning from the past to serve the present." This slogan has a reasonable demand, which is to select from reality what is useful. However, it is also necessary to recognize from reality the valuable historical existence in traditional culture to avoid being discarded, because traditional culture indeed contains elements that were not needed in contemporary life but had their own brilliance in their original historical context. Every culture is a product of a specific historical era, existing within a certain history, and there is no culture outside of history. If only "learning from the past to serve the present" is emphasized without "understanding the past through the present," then the traditional culture, which originally had a dual-directional connotation, is reduced to a one-way movement. In recent years, there has been a proposal for the revival of Confucianism, which is quite popular. It views Confucianism as a remedy for spiritual ailments in a highly materialistic society, including a sense of nostalgia among some overseas Chinese. It can be seen as a trend in understanding tradition, but it seems to have little practical use for building new culture and may even hinder or weaken the impact on the irrational and lifeless parts of traditional culture.

Understanding the core of traditional culture is the primary condition for selection. Some scholars, especially those from Hong Kong and Taiwan, advocate for Confucian thought as the core, with Confucian doctrine as the mainstream. Western Sinologists also often use Confucianism to summarize Chinese traditional culture. In fact, Confucianism is not a single entity. Before Confucian culture, there was a fusion of cultures among various ethnic groups within China. After Confucianism was established, there was a synthesis of Confucianism with Buddhism and Taoism, leading to the metaphysics of the Wei and Jin dynasties and the Neo-Confucianism of the Song and Ming dynasties. In reality, Confucianism has already absorbed various cultural sources, so it is necessary to further seek the core.

Among the three major cultural centers in the world, Chinese traditional culture is neither like Greek culture, which emphasizes the relationship between humans and nature, nor like Indian culture, which emphasizes the relationship between humans and gods. Instead, as some scholars advocate, it is centered around humanism (more precisely, human relations). This is a view that aligns with reality. Because Chinese traditional culture places the relationship between humans and nature as "harmony between heaven and man," as Sima Qian took "investigating the relationship between heaven and man, and exploring the changes of ancient and modern times" as the standard for writing history. Chinese traditional culture also handles the relationship between humans and gods as a pantheistic concept, that is, all gods around humans are determined and named by human will, and "worshipping gods as if they are present" is a typical summary. Chinese traditional culture uniquely emphasizes real human relationships, such as benevolence, love for all things, respect for the elderly, kindness to the young, human relations, and "not knowing life, how can one know death," all of which reflect the core of Chinese traditional culture.

Next, we should select traditional culture from the following perspectives:

(1) Traditional culture should not be viewed as the legacy of sages and worthies, which can only be preserved and maintained without selection. It should not be used as a past shackle to constrain future development, becoming a burden for the construction of modern national culture.

(2) Traditional culture is a historical accumulation. Long-standing nations naturally have sediment in the process of cultural accumulation, so traditional culture inevitably contains both good and bad elements, and even its essence is not flawless, but it continuously changes and develops with the times and societal needs.

(3) Traditional culture is not a frozen corpse; it has past origins, present characteristics, and is a starting point for the future, so it must have selectable elements and should not rashly discard the baby with the bathwater.

(4) Traditional culture is multi-layered and comprehensive, including material, institutional, customary, ideological, upper-class, folk, etc. Even Confucian thought is not singular but diverse. The Confucian scholar Xunzi recorded in his "Law of Conduct" that a scholar once asked, "Why is the master's door so mixed?"

(5) Traditional culture contains many contradictions and conflicts with modern society, such as equality versus hierarchy, openness versus closure, reform versus conservatism, horizontal absorption versus vertical inheritance, etc. One must distinguish between contradictions, choose the better, and be good at recognizing and reflecting on tradition.

With these understandings, one will not be confused or helpless when faced with the complex content of traditional culture. It can describe and record the splendor of a specific era under historical conditions and can also evaluate and select from a developmental perspective to meet the needs of modern national cultural construction.

　　论本土传统文化的选择
    来新夏
    近年来，关于中国文化的讨论已引起海内外学术界的关注，许多学者争相发表意见，撰写论文与专著，形成一股谈论中国文化的热潮。讨论问题之一便是如何对待本土文化，尤其是本土文化的传统部分，即一般惯称的“传统文化”。“传统文化”这个概念曾被一些人错误地等同于中国历史遗留的“沉重枷锁”，而把“西化”与现代化划等号，明显地置西方文化于无传统的地位。正因为概念含混，以致视传统文化为落后而必需摒弃，外来文化为先进而“全盘西化”。传统本应与现代、当代对称，不论本土和外来文化中都各有传统。在讨论对待中国本土传统文化的态度时，主张恢复者有之；主张抛弃者有之；而主张区别对待者也有之。各自为说，莫衷一是。实际上，问题在于没有很好地剖析“传统”的含意。
    我认为“传统”是特定时代不断形成和发展的一种历史概念。它必须经过延续沿用和普遍认可。“传统”既是社会存在的反映，也是不断变化发展的社会现象。任何“传统”既不是单一的，也不是好坏两极，而是多来源、分地区、全方位、多层次地反映时代。因此，不能把“传统”单纯地看作是有害的保守阻力，因为它同时也可能是向前发展的起点。有人把“传统”看作“既是包袱，也是财富”，确是一种公允的看法。
    “既是包袱，也是财富”，那么对待传统文化就不能凭一种主观臆断或情感牵制而采取恢复保留或摒弃斩断的态度，而必须采取一种审慎选择的态度。所谓选择就是要筛选、淘汰、保存、继承和发扬，并将精选所得更新为现实的和未来的新文化的结构成分。从汉魏以来，中国的传统文化都在这种不断创造中形成新的文化模式。直至近代，这种探求仍在继续，如清末的“中体西用”便是在长期挨打后的一种选择。这一口号是在外来势力不断侵入的特定时代所产生，并且有为封建制度“补漏缝缺”的政治目的。它一方面被迫接受传统观念中视为“奇技淫巧”的外来器物层作为“西用”，另一方面仍然保持中国传统文化中固有的理论制度层，是为“中体”。其结果是随着西方器物层的技术进口，西方那些政治理论与组织制度模式也出乎意料地在一条船上被载了进来，冲击着固有的“中体”。这不能不说是辛亥革命和民国初年某些民主模式（尽管它已被扭曲）的源头之一。实际上，“中体西用”并未能为近代新文化的建设作出贡献，而只能是一种历史的陈迹。
    近几十年来，对传统文化的选择标准是“取其精华，去其糟粕”，并进而诠释为民主性精华和封建性糟粕。这个标准曾产生过时代效应，运用时也简便易行；但有时却把传统文化简单化了。如果以简单的非此即彼的选择标尺，是与实际不相符合的。因为其一是，视好坏之间即精华与糟粕之间不存在中性文化（无益无害文化），事实上中性文化是存在的；其二是中国传统文化基本上产生于封建土壤之上，若对具体的文化缺乏分析，笼统地说去掉封建性糟粕，则很容易将中华历史看成是一片虚无空白，这是完全违背历史存在的。
    还有一种被作为选择传统文化的标准是人所习知的“古为今用”。这一口号有其合理的要求，即从现实需要去挑选为我所用者。但还应该从现实反过去认识传统文化中某些有价值的历史存在，以免被丢弃，因为传统文化中确有不是现实生活所需用，而在其原来的特定的历史时代中仍有其光辉的东西。因为每一种文化都是特定历史时代的产物，它存在于一定历史之中，超历史的文化是没有的。如果只是“古为今用”，而没有“以今识古”，那就使本来具有双向内涵的传统文化只能赋予有来无往单向运动的意义了。近年来，更出现了一种儒学复兴的主张，而且比较流行。它把儒学作为高度物质文明中医治精神弊病的“良药”，当然其中也包括一部分异国游子寻根意识的感情纠葛。它可以被作为认识传统的一种思潮；但对建设新文化似乎于实际无补，甚至阻止或削弱对传统文化中已失去生命力的不合理部分的冲击力。
    了解传统文化的核心是进行选择的首要条件。有些学者，特别是港台学者多主张以儒家思想为核心，以儒家学说为主流；西方的汉学家也多以儒家来概括中国的传统文化。其实儒家并不是单一体，因为在儒家文化之前，中国有境内各民族的文化融合；在儒家定于一尊之后，又有儒家与释、道之学的和合物，而有魏晋玄学和宋明理学等等，事实上儒家已经杂糅进多种文化来源，因此需要更进一步去寻求核心。
    在世界三大文化中心中，中国传统文化既不像希腊文化那样注重人与自然的关系，也不像印度文化那样注重人与神的关系，而是如目前一些学者所推崇和主张的乃是以人文主义（更准确点说是人伦思想）为核心。这是比较符合实际的看法。因为中国传统文化中把人与自然的关系摆成“天人合一”，如司马迁就把“究天人之际，穷古今之变”作为写史准则。中国传统文化也把人与神的关系处理成一种泛神观念，即凡在人周围的神都是以人的意愿去确定其存在并命名的，“祭神如神在”正是一种典型概括。中国传统文化唯独对于人际间的现实关系非常注重，仁人爱物、尊老慈幼、人伦纲常以及“未知生，焉知死”等等论题，都表现中国传统文化的核心所在。
    其次，我们应从如下所述的一些认识观念去选择传统文化，即：
    （１）不能把传统文化视作圣人贤哲的遗留，只能保存、维护而不容去取选择。更不要以逝去的枷锁来束缚后来的发展，成为现代化民族文化建设的包袱。
    （２）传统文化是历史的累积。历史悠久的民族在文化积累过程中自然会有沉渣，因此传统文化势必会泥沙俱下，良莠并存，即使其精华部分也不能说毫无瑕疵，只是随时代和社会的需求不断发生变化和发展。
    （３）传统文化不是凝固的死亡遗体，它既有过去源头，又有现实特色，更是未来起点，所以必有可备选择的，不可轻率地把孩子和洗澡水一齐泼掉。
    （４）传统文化是多层次全方位的，有物质的、制度的、风习的、思想的、上层的、民间的，等等。即使儒家思想也非单一而是杂陈的，儒学大师荀况在其《法行》篇中就曾记述过一位学者的质询说：“夫子之门，何其杂也？”
    （５）传统文化中有不少与现代社会间有矛盾冲突，如平等与等级、开放与封闭、改革与保守、横向吸收与垂直承受等等。要明辨矛盾，择善而从，并且善于认识和反思传统。
    有了这些认识，那么在传统文化的纷繁内容面前就不致有所困惑而束手。它既能就历史条件作量的描述与记录以显示特定时代的璀璨；也可用发展观点作质的评价和选择以适合现代化民族文化建设的需要。
