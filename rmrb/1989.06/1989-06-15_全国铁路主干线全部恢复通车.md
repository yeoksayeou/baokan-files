Xinhua News Agency, Beijing, June 13th.

All main railway lines in the country, including the Jingguang, Jinghu, and Longhai lines, which were previously disrupted, have now resumed operation thanks to the efforts of the vast number of railway workers nationwide and the assistance of local governments, the People's Armed Police, and the People's Liberation Army. Railway transportation is gradually returning to normal.

By June 9th, all disrupted sections had resumed operation, and all lines were clear, with passenger trains running on schedule. The level of loading and unloading has begun to recover. By June 12th, the daily average number of loaded cars exceeded the plan by 2,532, reaching normal levels.

It is reported that since early June, many regions across the country have experienced multiple incidents of disrupting railways, intercepting trains, and blocking railway crossings, seriously affecting railway transportation. From June 4th to 8th, railways nationwide were disrupted 49 times, totaling nearly 350 hours. Among them, the Jingguang line was disrupted for 135 hours, the Jinghu line for 63 hours, and the Longhai line for 64 hours. A large number of passenger and freight trains were held up along the way. From June 5th to 9th, the daily average number of held-up trains reached 639 trains and 27,490 cars. The loading level also dropped sharply, with 7,266 fewer cars loaded per day than planned, the lowest level this year. Due to severe delays in passenger trains, many trains could not operate, and from June 4th to 9th, 331 passenger trains were forced to stop. In early June, the daily average number of passengers sent nationwide was only 2.785 million, a decrease of over 1 million from the same period last month.

Even in such difficult circumstances, the vast number of railway workers nationwide stood firm at their posts, working overtime and continuously, doing their utmost to ensure the priority loading of industrial key materials and essential items for people's livelihood. Despite the overall daily average loading level dropping nationwide, coal loading exceeded the plan, with 153 more cars loaded per day than planned. In particular, coal sent to the five major power grids did not experience a significant drop, ensuring the normal operation of power plants and preventing major social unrest among the people.

　　全国铁路主干线全部恢复通车
    新华社北京６月１３日电  据铁道部消息，一度中断的京广、京沪、陇海等铁路主要干线经过全路广大职工的努力和各级地方政府、武警部队、人民解放军的协助，现已全部开通。铁路运输秩序逐步恢复正常。
    到６月９日，全部所有中断处所全部恢复行车，各条线路畅通无阻，在途的旅客列车正常开行，装卸车水平开始回升。至６月１２日，全路装车日均超过计划２５３２车，已达到正常水平。
    据介绍，６月上旬以来，全国不少地区多次发生冲击铁路、拦截列车，围堵铁路道口等恶性事件，使铁路运输生产受到严重影响。６月４日至８日，全国铁路共中断行车４９次近３５０小时。其中，京广线中断１３５小时，京沪线中断６３小时，陇海线中断６４小时。大量客、货列车在沿途保留。６月５日至９日，全路日均保留列车达６３９列２７４９０辆。装车水平也急剧下降，每天比计划少装７２６６车，是今年以来最低水平。由于旅客列车严重晚点，许多客车不能开行，６月４日至９日，客车被迫停开３３１列。６月上旬，全路日均发送旅客人数仅为２７８．５万人次，比上月同期减少１００多万人次。
    即使在如此困难的情况下，全路广大职工坚守岗位，超劳超时，连续作战，尽最大努力保证了工业重点物资和人民生活急需品的优先装运。在全路总体日均装车水平下降的情况下，煤炭装车超额完成计划，比计划每日多装１５３车。特别是全路运往五大电网的煤炭没有出现大幅度滑坡，保证了电厂的正常生产，保证了人民群众的社会生活没有出现大的动荡。
