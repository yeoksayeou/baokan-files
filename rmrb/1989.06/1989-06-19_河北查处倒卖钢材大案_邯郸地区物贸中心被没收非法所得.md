Xinhua News Agency, Shijiazhuang, June 19th.

Hebei Province's Handan Regional Materials and Trade Center has been found to have abused its material management authority to engage in large-scale scalping of steel materials and steel material quotas, earning illegal profits amounting to tens of thousands of yuan. This case has recently been investigated and handled by Hebei Province's Industrial and Commercial Administration.

In May 1987, the Handan Regional Materials and Trade Center, under the guise of bartering, reached a verbal agreement with the China Metallurgical Products Import and Export Corporation to exchange 1,700 tons of flat-price construction steel for 3,220.5 tons of cold-rolled steel quotas at the national steel materials procurement meeting. Subsequently, this batch of steel material quotas was entrusted to the Nanjing Steel Rolling Plant's Cold-Rolled Section to be sold at a price of 300 yuan per ton to 25 units. At that time, a total of 1,870.575 tons of quotas were sold, earning illegal profits of 561,000 yuan. In addition, the trade center used the method of not spending any capital, only using settlement procedures, to resell 443.19 tons of steel materials purchased from the Wuhan Iron and Steel Design Research Institute's Experimental Plant at a higher price, earning illegal profits of 152,000 yuan. It also purchased 643.72 tons of flat-price steel materials within the plan from the Hankou Thin Plate Plant and Nanjing Steel Rolling Plant's Cold-Rolled Section, and then resold them at a higher price to the Wuhan Steel Materials Market and five other units, earning profits of 255,000 yuan.

The Handan Regional Materials and Trade Center, under the pretext of activating the economy, engaged in large-scale scalping of steel materials and steel material quotas, seriously disrupting the economic order. According to relevant national regulations, Hebei Province's Industrial and Commercial Administration has confiscated all of the trade center's illegal earnings and handed them over to the financial authorities. The main responsible parties in this case will be subject to administrative disciplinary actions by the relevant departments.

　　河北查处倒卖钢材大案
    邯郸地区物贸中心被没收非法所得
    据新华社石家庄６月１９日电  （记者赵永金）河北省邯郸地区物资贸易中心利用掌握的物资经营权，大量倒卖钢材和钢材指标，牟取暴利达数１０万元，近日被河北省工商行政管理机关查处。
    邯郸地区物资贸易中心１９８７年５月在全国钢材订货会上，以串换为名，与中国金属产品贸易有限公司达成了用１７００吨平价基建钢材，换取３２２０．５吨冷弯型钢材指标的口头协议；随即把换来的这批钢材指标，就地委托南京轧钢厂冷弯型分厂，以每吨３００元的价格卖给２５个单位，当时共卖出指标１８７０．５７５吨，非法获利５６．１万多元。此外，该贸易中心采用不动分文资金、只用结算手续的方法，将从武汉钢铁设计研究院试验工厂购进的４４３．１９吨钢材，就地加价转手倒卖，从中非法牟利１５．２万多元；还从汉口薄板厂、南京轧钢厂冷弯型分厂购进计划内平价钢材６４３．７２吨，然后加价倒卖给武汉钢材市场等５个单位，从中获利２５．５万多元。
    邯郸地区物资贸易中心打着搞活经济的幌子，大量倒卖钢材和钢材指标，严重扰乱了经济秩序。河北省工商行政管理机关根据国家有关规定，已将该贸易中心的非法所得全部没收上缴财政。对本案的主要责任者，有关部门将给予行政纪律处分。
