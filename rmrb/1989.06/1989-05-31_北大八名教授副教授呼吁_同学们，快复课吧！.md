Eight professors and associate professors from Peking University urge students to resume classes

New China News Agency, Beijing, May 31 - Some professors and associate professors from Peking University wrote a letter to the school leadership on May 29, hoping that students would resume classes. The full text of the letter signed by Professors Feng Zhongyun and Zhao Qiping, and Associate Professors Zhou Qiang, Li Guangzhong, Dong Xuewen, Wang Lijia, Min Kaide, and Zhu Shiyi is as follows:

	Students, please resume classes!

	Since mid-April, teaching at our university has been unable to proceed normally, and campus order has been difficult to maintain. Students, out of patriotic fervor, demand the elimination of corruption, punishment of officials involved in corruption, and acceleration of the democratization process. These demands represent the common aspirations of the broad masses of teachers and students, as well as the people, and are in line with the wishes of the Party and the government. However, the facts of the past month have clearly shown that using methods such as class boycotts, marches, and hunger strikes can fully express the indignation of the masses and the urgency of their hopes, but cannot effectively solve specific problems. Instead, they easily lead to a stalemate, prolonging the situation without achieving anything. At this point, many students have not yet resumed classes, and the summer vacation is approaching. If classes are not resumed soon, the original teaching plan will be difficult to complete, which will cause a huge loss that will affect students for the rest of their lives. In view of this, we sincerely advise students who have not yet resumed classes to be extremely cautious in dealing with serious political issues. In the current complex situation, it is particularly necessary to maintain a high degree of calm and rationality. We hope that students will consider the long-term situation, make a decisive move, resume classes, and through various channels and levels, engage in dialogue with Party and government leaders at all levels in a democratic and legal manner to seek a proper solution to the problems. Do not oppose patriotism with diligent study for the motherland. Please cherish your youth!

　　北大八名教授副教授呼吁
    同学们，快复课吧！
    新华社北京５月３１日电  北京大学一些教授、副教授５月２９日写信给北京大学校领导，希望同学们复课。冯钟芸、赵齐平教授，周强、李光中、董学文、王理嘉、闵开德、朱士毅副教授的联名信全文如下：
    同学们，快复课吧！
    从４月中旬以来，我校的教学基本上不能正常进行，校园秩序亦无法维持。同学们出于满腔爱国热忱，要求清除腐败，惩治官倒，加速民主化进程，这些都代表了广大教职员工和广大人民的共同心愿，也与党和政府的愿望一致。但是，一个多月的事实，清楚地表明，采用罢课、游行和绝食等手段，能充分表现群情激愤和希望的殷切，不能切切实实地解决具体问题，并且容易形成僵持不下的局面，旷日持久，于事无补。时至今日，不少同学尚未复课，离暑假却越来越近。如果不尽快复课，原订的教学计划难以完成，将给同学们造成影响终生的巨大损失。有鉴于此，我们诚恳地劝告尚未复课的同学们，对待严肃的政治问题，必须慎之又慎，在当前异常复杂的形势下，尤其需要高度的冷静和理智。希望同学们从长远考虑，当机立断，一面复课，一面在民主与法制的轨道上，通过多种渠道、多种层次，与党和政府各级领导人进行对话，谋求问题的妥善解决。不要把爱国与为祖国而刻苦学习对立起来，请珍惜自己的青春年华吧！
