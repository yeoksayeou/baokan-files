Title: What to Show the Living?

It was the lunar month of December, and two pieces of bad news came in quick succession: my parents had passed away. I was anxious and hurried back home with my wife to attend the funerals.

My father and mother were the same age, both 81, and had been ill for many years. It was expected that they would not live much longer. My siblings and I had discussed it beforehand: "Show filial piety while they are alive, and keep the funeral simple." However, as soon as I entered the house, I was surprised by the elaborate scene: the band had already arrived, and the paper craftsmen were at work. The male and female pallbearers were each doing their jobs, and the courtyard was bustling with people coming and going. In front of the parents' bier, a basin of paper ashes was smoking.

We politely conveyed our intention to keep the funeral simple to the elders in charge, but they said, "You all work in the city, so it's not appropriate to have a big funeral, but you still need to consider how it looks. No mourning clothes, no burial, no paper offerings, just wear a black armband, have a meal, and leave. As for the music, it must be played, and the paper figures and horses are also necessary. This is for the living to see."

They had thought of what we should have considered and done it for us. Both my mother's and father's funerals were conducted in this half-traditional, half-modern, half-new, half-old ceremony.

Although we complied, we did not gain a reputation for being filial. Later, we learned that holding such a "stingy" and "shabby" funeral was rare in the surrounding villages. No wonder the villagers mocked us, saying, "Raising children is useless (working outside), it's better to have a son who can carry a hoe!"

Several months have passed, but a question still lingers in my mind: What exactly is shown to the living? For children, filial piety to parents is a natural duty. In our parents' old age, my siblings and I took turns caring for and supporting them. Before my mother passed away, she lost control of her bladder and bowels, and we would wash her bedding, clothes, and body every day, dress her, comb her hair, and wash her face. As my mother's condition worsened, she would have bowel movements seven or eight times a day. In the countryside, water is not convenient to get, and my brother and sister would break the ice on the river and wash my mother's clothes and bedding in the cold water.

What exactly is shown to the living? Is it not "filial piety in life," but rather the grandeur of the funeral? If one is not filial in life, what does a grand funeral after death have to do with "filial piety"? If so, at the very least, it misinterprets the meaning of "filial piety to the elderly." If the spirits of the elderly knew, they might not approve of this wasteful "filial piety."

　　给活人看什么？
    王庆祥
    时值腊月，噩耗两次传来：父母相继去世。我心急如焚，携妻子回家奔丧。
    父亲和母亲同龄，八十一岁，患病也已多年。老人不久于人世，本是意料中事。我们兄妹五人曾商议过：“活着尽孝，后事从简”。然而，我刚进家门，一番“隆重”场景却出乎想象：吹鼓手已经到位，“纸匠”也进入工作状态，男女“执殡”各司其职，满院人员出出进进，忙忙碌碌。老人灵床前，一盆纸灰青烟缭绕。
    我们向“主事”的长辈委婉表达“从简”的意思，长辈说：“你们是在外边吃‘官’饭的，办大了不行，可也得看过眼去。一不穿孝，二不土埋，三不送纸儿，每人戴块黑纱，吃完饭走人，到火化场火化。至于喇叭还是要吹的，纸人纸马也少不得，这是给活人看的。”
    应该子女想到的，人家替我们想到、做到了。母亲和父亲的葬礼都是在这半土半洋、半中半西、半新半旧的仪式中进行的。
    我们虽然“从命”了，但未赢得“孝”的名声，事后我们得知，殡葬老人如此“小气、寒酸”，在三里五村实属少见。难怪乡亲们奚落我们“养儿不能有出息（在外工作），还不如搂锄杠的呢！”
    几个月过去了，有个疑团却时常萦绕我心头：究竟给“活人”看什么？对儿女来说，孝敬老人天经地义，责无旁贷。在父母晚年，我们兄妹五人轮番侍奉赡养。母亲临终前大小便失禁，我们每天为老人洗刷被褥衣裤、擦身、穿衣、梳头洗脸。母亲病情恶化，一日大小便七八次。农村用水不方便，我的哥哥、姐姐都是在冰河中砸洞，在冰冷的河水中为母亲洗衣裳被褥。
    究竟给活人看什么，难道不是“生时孝敬”，而是死后的殡葬“气派”？活着不孝，死后再排场又与“孝”何关？如是那样，最起码是曲解了“孝敬老人”的含义。老人如果泉下之灵有知，对这种铺张浪费的“孝”法，恐怕也会不以为然。
