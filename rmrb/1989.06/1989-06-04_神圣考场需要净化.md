In many universities, although the school administration always conducts a routine reminder before each exam about not cheating, and although the school always reports the punishment of those caught cheating after each exam, cheating has become increasingly rampant.

Many students do not consider cheating to be a bad or shameful thing. In broad daylight, they can openly discuss how to cheat. Even when some cheaters are caught, most people still sympathize with them, blaming their bad luck.

Some courses are dull and fail to arouse students' interest, which is also a reason for cheating. Some courses have outdated viewpoints and content, unable to explain real-world problems. Teachers cannot even convince themselves, let alone their students. It's no wonder some people think these courses have no value to learn, not even worth copying for the exam, so why waste time? For such courses, cheating becomes the main way to get by, and more and more people are doing it.

In the eyes of many cheaters, teachers and schools tacitly approve of cheating. In the exam hall, many proctors often turn a blind eye to cheating. Schools handle cheating cases in a way that is generally "killing the chicken to scare the monkeys," with a soft heart and a light hand. With so many cheaters, how can the law be enforced against the masses?

The increasing number of falsehoods in society also has an impact on the psychology of young students. Some important matters related to the fate of the country are also falsified, so exam cheating is merely a small matter in comparison. Society uses low income to deceive scholars, and scholars use exam cheating to deceive society.

Of course, ultimately, it is oneself who is deceived by cheating. This is obvious, but such a severely distorted cheating mentality should also be a cause for concern and reflection by relevant departments, to improve work and purify the sacred university exam hall.

　　神圣考场需要净化
    陈秋中
    在不少大学，尽管每次考试前校方都要例行公事地作一番不准作弊的教育，尽管每次考试后，校方都要通报处分作弊者，但作弊却越演越烈。
    对考试作弊，不少大学生既不认为是坏事，也不认为是丑事。在光天化日之下，他们也可以堂而皇之“研究”如何作弊。个别作弊者被查获，多数还会同情，怪他运气不好。
    某些课程索然无味，不能引起学生的兴趣，也是学生作弊的一个原因。有些课程观点、内容过于陈旧，无法解释现实中的问题，教师说服不了自己，更说服不了学生。难怪有人认为，这种课程没有学习的价值，连考试照抄一遍都不值，何必浪费时光？对这类课，作弊成了应付的主要手段，而且人越来越多。
    在不少作弊者看来，教师和学校对作弊是默许的。在考场上，不少监考老师常常是睁一只眼闭一只眼，对作弊行为视而不见。学校处理作弊问题，一般也是“杀鸡给猴看”，心也慈，手也软。作弊人数如此之多，法又如何责众？
    社会上日益增多的虚假现象，对年轻的学生心理上也是一种冲击。有些关系到国家命运前途的重大事情还有人作假，考试作假充其量不过是小巫见大巫而已。社会用低收入糊弄读书人，读书人便用考试作弊糊弄社会。
    当然，最终被作弊糊弄的，还是自己。这是显而易见的，但如此严重扭曲的作弊心态，是否也应该引起有关部门的关注和反思，以改进工作，净化神圣的大学考场呢？
