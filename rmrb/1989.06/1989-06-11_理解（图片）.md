On the morning of June 10, Qu Shufen from Beijing's Rongxian Hutong delivered cigarettes to the martial law troops of the People's Liberation Army who were transporting grain. She said with deep emotion: "You have come to Beijing to carry out martial law, suppress the counter-revolutionary rebellion, and protect the lives and property of the people. You are so hardworking. Please be sure to accept our family's token of appreciation."
