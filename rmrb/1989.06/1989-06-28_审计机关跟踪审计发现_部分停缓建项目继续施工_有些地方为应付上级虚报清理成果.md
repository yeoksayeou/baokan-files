	Audit agencies have been tracking audits this year to implement the State Council's deployment to reduce the scale of construction investment. The situation provided by the National Audit Office indicates that some units still violate the ban, and some halted projects are still under construction.

	Hubei Province conducted tracking audits on 305 halted projects and found that 26 projects had not stopped work. The audit office of the National Audit Office in Shenyang audited 12 projects, of which 3 construction projects had not stopped as decided. The guest house project of Guangdong Provincial Coal Industry Corporation received a notice to halt construction at the end of last year, but the bank that opened the account still allocated 250,000 yuan for construction in January this year. Therefore, the provincial audit bureau, while requiring the relevant units to stop work immediately as decided, imposed a fine of 400,000 yuan. The comprehensive building project of Shanghai Fengxian County Industrial Association was partially halted by the county government, requiring construction up to the seventh floor and roofing, but one month after the decision was issued, the building had been constructed up to the ninth floor, and some parts had been built up to the tenth floor. The commercial building project of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Commercial Bureau continued with preliminary preparations after the government decided to delay construction and was ready to start construction as soon as the cleanup was over.

	It is also understood that some projects listed for halting construction in some places are not actually under construction. The cleanup results are falsely reported just to appease higher authorities and have not actually been reduced. In the 12 halted projects audited by the Anhui Provincial Audit Bureau, it was found that only 4 were under construction, and the rest were projects that had not started. Some projects, although the construction area has been reduced, have not reduced the investment.

	In addition, some places have not strictly implemented the cleanup work for the halted construction projects, and some supervisory departments have delayed issuing the halt construction notice to the construction units, resulting in some loopholes. Among the 31 halted projects decided by Guiyang City, 15 had not received the halt construction notice by the time the audit agencies conducted tracking audits and were still under construction.

　　审计机关跟踪审计发现
    部分停缓建项目继续施工    
    有些地方为应付上级虚报清理成果
    本报北京６月２８日讯  记者王锦鹄报道：今年以来，各级审计机关为落实国务院压缩基建投资规模的部署，对政府决定的停缓建项目进行了跟踪审计。审计署提供的情况表明，目前仍有一些单位有禁不止，部分停缓建项目还在继续施工。
    湖北省对３０５个决定停缓建的项目跟踪审计，发现２６个项目未停工。审计署驻沈阳特派员办事处审计的１２个项目中，有３个在建项目未按决定停缓建。广东省煤炭工业总公司招待所项目去年底接到省清办停缓建通知，而开户银行今年１月还拨付基建款２５万元。为此，省审计局在要求有关单位按决定立即停工的同时，处以４０万元罚款。上海市奉贤县工业联社综合楼项目，县政府决定部分停建，要求建至七层封顶，但决定下达１个多月后，大楼已建至九层，局部建至十层。内蒙古自治区商业厅营业楼项目在政府决定缓建后，仍进行前期准备工作，并准备待清理风头一过，立即开工。
    另据了解，一些地方被列为停缓建的项目，实际并非在建项目。虚报清理成果，不过是为了应付上级，并未真正压缩。安徽省审计局审计的１２个停缓建项目中，发现仅有４个是在建项目，其余为未开工的工程。也有些项目虽压缩了建筑面积，但未压缩投资。
    此外，个别地方对决定停缓建的基建项目清理工作抓得不紧，有的主管部门迟迟不向建设单位下达停缓建通知，造成一些漏洞。贵阳市决定的３１个停缓建项目中，有１５个直至审计机关跟踪审计时，尚未接到停缓建通知，还在继续施工。
