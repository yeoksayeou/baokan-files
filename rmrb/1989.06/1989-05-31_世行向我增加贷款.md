World Bank Increases Loans to China

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Beijing on May 31, a senior official from the Ministry of Finance said that the World Bank provided a total of $2.12 billion in loans to China in the 1989 fiscal year, an increase of 24% compared to the previous fiscal year.

Chen Junshuo, Deputy Director of the World Bank Division of the Ministry of Finance, stated, "This growth rate is the highest in recent years, whether it is the World Bank's loans to China or to other third-world countries."

These loans will be used for the construction of 18 projects, including agriculture, highways, ports, railways, phosphate mines, and light industry.

Chen Junshuo estimated that the loans for the 1990 fiscal year will not be less than this year.

In this year's loans, soft loans with a 35-year grace period and no interest account for 36.9%; hard loans with an annual interest rate of 7.65% and a repayment period of 20 years account for 63.1%.
