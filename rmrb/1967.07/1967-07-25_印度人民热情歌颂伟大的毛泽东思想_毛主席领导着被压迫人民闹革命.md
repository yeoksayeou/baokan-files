At a time when the Indian reactionaries, in collusion with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, are viciously slandering the great leader of the revolutionary people of the whole world, Chairman Mao, the broad masses of Indian revolutionaries, with boundless reverence, are using the most sincere words to warmly praise the great leader Chairman Mao and the great Mao Zedong Thought. They say: "Chairman Mao is not only the wise leader of the Chinese people, but also the wise leader of the Indian people and the people of the whole world." "The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought has illuminated the entire world." "Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of the whole world will surely achieve final victory."

The Indian revolutionary people yearn to see the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao. Whenever they see Chairman Mao's brilliant image in Chinese films, they cannot suppress their inner excitement and burst into thunderous applause. They see Chairman Mao radiant with health, see the touching scenes of Chairman Mao and the broad masses with hearts united, see the revolutionary masses holding high the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," forming a boundless red sea, their emotions blend with the emotions of tens of millions of Chinese revolutionary masses in the film. They excitedly write letters or pour out their boundless love for Chairman Mao to Chinese friends. An Indian friend said: "Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time." "Chairman Mao is a true leader of the people, he is always with the people." Some Indian friends say: "Chairman Mao is not only the wise leader of the Chinese people, but also the wise leader of the Indian people and the people of the whole world." "Chairman Mao is the greatest leader in the world today."

An Indian friend deeply appreciates the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant guidance in the revolutionary struggle of the oppressed people. He said: "Chairman Mao has developed Marxism-Leninism, and every time there is a major event in the world, he always issues a call to guide the struggle of the oppressed people." "We are very fortunate, because we live in the era of Mao Zedong."

An Indian revolutionary said: "Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people, but also the great leader of the oppressed and exploited people of the whole world. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought has illuminated the entire world. The oppressed people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America all respect him. Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the people of the whole world will surely achieve final victory. Chairman Mao is the eternal leader of the oppressed and exploited people of the world."

The Indian people from the bottom of their hearts wish the best for Chairman Mao. Some Indian friends say: "Seeing Chairman Mao in good health is truly a joy. Chairman Mao's health is not only the happiness of the Chinese people, but also the happiness of the people of the whole world." Some say: "I am an Indian, I support the great Mao Zedong Thought. Long live Mao Zedong!" Another Indian friend, full of passion, said: "I wish Chairman Mao Zedong a long life! May China, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong, further lead the world revolution. Let the red sun shine forever in the East."
