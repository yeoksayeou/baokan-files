The most resounding song is "The East is Red," and the greatest leader is Mao Zedong. In this new era where the world has raised the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary masses of China and the revolutionary people of the world are continuously obtaining the long-awaited portraits of Chairman Mao. The revolutionary people draw boundless spiritual strength from the radiant image of Chairman Mao, the red sun in their hearts, and march forward on the revolutionary road with even greater fighting spirit.

In the short span of eleven months from last July to this May, the revolutionary workers in China's photography and art publishing industries, with hearts full of boundless respect for Chairman Mao, have printed 840 million portraits of Chairman Mao. This number is more than five times the total printed in the sixteen years before the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Now, portraits of Chairman Mao are not only supplied in large quantities throughout China but are also widely circulated in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and other parts of the world. This is a great achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought, and another triumphant song of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line that resonates through the clouds!

The portraits of Chairman Mao printed in various places include 33 types, both in color and black and white. These photographs record the radiant image of our great leader Chairman Mao. Most of them record Chairman Mao's great practice of being heart to heart with the revolutionary masses during the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, inspecting the cultural revolutionary army time and again, and wholeheartedly supporting the revolutionary mass movement.

The billion revolutionary people of China, who are infinitely loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, are deeply moved when they obtain portraits of Chairman Mao. They gaze at Chairman Mao's portrait with deep emotion and even greater love and loyalty to the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Mao Zedong. They carry Chairman Mao's portrait and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them at all times. When they study and apply Chairman Mao's works, seeing Chairman Mao's portrait is like having Chairman Mao by their side, as if Chairman Mao is speaking to them directly. They feel enlightened, clear about the direction, and filled with boundless energy!

Revolutionary people from various countries are also greatly inspired when they obtain portraits of Chairman Mao. Foreign friends who have long yearned for the great leader Chairman Mao often cannot help but shout with joy when they finally get a portrait of Chairman Mao: "Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! I see you today!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand times long live Chairman Mao!" The military and civilians in South Vietnam, who are fighting on the front lines against American imperialism, jump for joy when they receive portraits of Chairman Mao. They say that Chairman Mao's radiant image and the great Mao Zedong Thought have become the source of their strength and the guarantee of their victory!

Chairman Mao is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. He has brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to a new stage—the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. All the revolutionary people of China and the world look towards Beijing and Chairman Mao with their hearts. They express their most sincere wish from the bottom of their hearts: to be able to see Chairman Mao's radiant image frequently. Thus, billions of revolutionary hearts have turned into urgent telegrams and letters, pouring in from various places at home and abroad to China's photography and art publishing industries!

Letters and telegrams from various places in China express the boundless love of the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary students, and revolutionary cadres for Chairman Mao. In their letters and telegrams, they eagerly express: "We cannot do without Chairman Mao for a moment. We want to see Chairman Mao at all times. Chairman Mao is heart to heart with us. When we see Chairman Mao's portrait, we feel that Chairman Mao is by our side, commanding us in battle. We can then surmount thousands of mountains and break through ten thousand waves, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!"

From the letters and telegrams from abroad eager to obtain portraits of Chairman Mao, it can be seen that the revolutionary people of the world, like the Chinese people, have the same strong feelings of boundless love for the greatest revolutionary leader of our time, Chairman Mao. The revolutionary people of various countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America, who are fighting for national independence and liberation, all regard obtaining portraits of Chairman Mao as "the greatest happiness of their lives." Many foreign friends say: "We hope that Chairman Mao will always be with us, leading us in revolution, guiding us to overcome all difficulties, and march from victory to victory!"

The sincere and deep feelings of boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao from all the revolutionary people of China and the world have resonated strongly among the revolutionary workers in China's photography and art publishing industries. In the past, their revolutionary wish to print large quantities of portraits of Chairman Mao was suppressed by a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, while fighting against these capitalist-roaders, they have decided to realize with their own hands the long-unfulfilled wish of printing large quantities of portraits of Chairman Mao!

    毛主席的光辉形象鼓舞着革命人民胜利前进
    我国摄影界和美术出版界在短短的十一个月中，已印制毛主席像八亿四千多万张，不仅在我国各地大量供应，而且在世界各地广泛发行
    据新华社十七日讯　最响亮的歌是《东方红》，最伟大的领袖是毛泽东。在全世界进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代里，我国广大革命群众和世界革命人民，正在源源不断地得到渴望已久的毛主席像。广大革命人民从自己心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的光辉形象里，得到了无穷无尽的精神力量，更加斗志昂扬地在革命的道路上奋勇前进。
    从去年七月到今年五月底短短十一个月当中，我国摄影界和美术出版界的革命职工，怀着对毛主席无限敬仰的心情，已经印制了毛主席像八亿四千多万张。这个数字相当于无产阶级文化大革命前十六年印制总数的五倍多。现在，毛主席像不仅在我国各地大量供应，而且在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲和世界其他地区广泛发行。这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大硕果，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的又一曲响彻云霄的凯歌！
    各地印制的毛主席像包括彩色和黑白色共三十三种。这些照片纪录了我们伟大的领袖毛主席的光辉形象。其中的大多数，纪录的是毛主席在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，和革命群众心连心，一次又一次地检阅文化革命大军，全心全意地支持革命群众运动的伟大实践。
    无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席的我国亿万革命人民，得到毛主席像片，深情凝望，无限激动，对伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席更加热爱，更加忠诚，人们把毛主席像和《毛主席语录》一起，随时带在身上。他们在活学活用毛主席著作时，看到毛主席像，如同毛主席就在自己身旁，好象毛主席就在给自己讲话，感到心明眼亮方向清，浑身上下增添了使不完的力量！
    各国革命人民得到毛主席像，都无限欢欣鼓舞。那些日夜思念伟大领袖毛主席的外国朋友们，一旦得到一张毛主席像，往往情不自禁地欢呼起来：“毛主席！毛主席！我今天看到你了！”“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”战斗在反对美帝国主义斗争前哨的越南南方军民，得到毛主席像都高兴地跳了起来。他们说，毛主席的光辉形象和伟大的毛泽东思想成了他们力量的源泉，胜利的保证！
    毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者，他天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到一个崭新的阶段，即毛泽东思想的阶段。全中国、全世界革命人民眼望北京，心向毛主席。他们从内心发出最殷切的愿望，就是能经常看到毛主席的光辉形象。于是，亿万颗革命的红心变成了一份份急电，一封封信件，从国内、外各地向我国摄影界和美术出版界发来！
    来自国内各地的信件和电报，表达了广大工农兵和革命师生、革命干部对毛主席的无限热爱。他们在来信、来电中急切地表示：我们一时一刻也离不开毛主席，我们要时时刻刻看到毛主席，毛主席和我们心连心，我们看到毛主席的像，就感到毛主席在我们的身边指挥我们战斗，我们就能踏平千重山，排开万层浪，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利！
    从一份份渴望得到毛主席像的国外来信、来电中可以看出，世界革命人民和中国人民一样对当代最伟大的革命导师毛主席怀有同样无限热爱的强烈感情。正在为争取民族独立解放而斗争的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲各国革命人民，都把得到毛主席像看作是自己
  “一生中最大的幸福”。许多外国朋友都说：我们希望毛主席永远和我们在一起，指挥我们闹革命，领导我们排除万难，从胜利走向胜利！
    全中国和全世界革命人民对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的真挚感情，在我国摄影界和美术出版界的革命职工中引起了强烈的共鸣。过去，他们要求大量印制毛主席像的革命愿望，遭到了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的压制。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作斗争的同时，决心用自己的双手，把大量印制毛主席像这个多年来没有实现的愿望变成现实！
