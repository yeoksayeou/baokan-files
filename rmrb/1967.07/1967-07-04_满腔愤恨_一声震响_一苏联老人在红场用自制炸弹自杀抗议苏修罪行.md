A Soviet old man, filled with indignation, detonates a self-made bomb in Red Square to protest against the crimes of the Soviet revisionists.

	New China News Agency, July 3rd: Moscow news: A 67-year-old Soviet old man, on June 28th, blew himself up with a "self-made explosive device" in Moscow's Red Square. This is the first time such an incident has occurred in Red Square since the October Revolution 50 years ago. It has caused a stir and discussion among the Soviet people.

	It is reported that after this incident, the number of police and plainclothes agents in Red Square has increased significantly compared to usual.

	The mouthpiece of the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, Tass, hurriedly issued a message about this matter on the 29th, which was then published in *Pravda* and *Izvestia*. However, the message was vague and did not dare to mention the cause of the old man's death, leaving people confused.

	The Tass message stated that the old man's name was Kresenkoff, "born in 1900, a retiree with a low level of education." He "was sentenced to imprisonment by the Vilnius Court in Lithuania in 1961. Later, he was hospitalized for severe cerebral arteriosclerosis." The message also said that Kresenkoff arrived in the capital from Vilnius on the 28th, carrying a self-made explosive device similar to a hand grenade. That evening at 7 PM, he was in Red Square when the self-made hand grenade exploded on his body.

	The message issued by the Soviet revisionist leadership to cover up the true political reasons for Kresenkoff's suicide has raised many questions. People do not understand why this old man, who had experienced the October Revolution and the period of building socialism under Stalin's leadership, would travel thousands of miles to Red Square, near the Kremlin where the Soviet revisionist ruling clique is based, and in front of a crowd, blow himself up in this manner?

	At a time when the Brezhnev-Kosygin traitor clique is intensifying their role as the number one henchman of U.S. imperialism internationally, betraying the interests of the people of the world, and fully restoring capitalism domestically, implementing barbaric fascist rule, the occurrence of this incident is certainly not coincidental. The attempt by the Soviet revisionist leadership to cover up the indignation and protest of the Soviet people against their heinous crimes is in vain.

### 满腔愤恨　一声震响　一苏联老人在红场用自制炸弹自杀抗议苏修罪行

　　满腔愤恨　一声震响
　　一苏联老人在红场用自制炸弹自杀抗议苏修罪行
    新华社三日讯　莫斯科消息：一位六十七岁的苏联老人，六月二十八日，在莫斯科红场上用“自制爆炸装置”把自己炸死。自十月革命以来的五十年中，在红场上发生这样的事件，这还是第一次。它在苏联人民中引起了震动和议论。
    据悉，这一事件发生后，红场上的警察和便衣特务比平日大有增加。
    苏修统治集团的喉舌塔斯社，二十九日急急忙忙为此事发了一条消息，并由《真理报》和《消息报》加以刊登。但是，这条消息含糊其词，对这位老人死亡的原因根本不敢讲，使人不知所云。
    塔斯社消息说，这位老人名叫克雷森科夫，“一九○○年生，是一位退休者，文化水平不高”。他“曾在一九六一年被立陶宛维尔纽斯法院判处徒刑。后来，他由于脑血管严重硬化在医院治疗”。消息又说，克雷森科夫是在二十八日“从维尔纽斯到达首都的，随身携带有手榴弹类型的自制爆炸装置”，当天“晚七时到了红场，自制手榴弹在他身上爆炸”。
    苏修领导集团发布的这条掩饰克雷森科夫自杀的真正政治原因的消息，使人们产生了很多疑问。人们不理解，这位经历过十月革命和在斯大林领导下建设社会主义时期的老人，为什么要在目前不远千里，赶到苏修统治集团所盘踞的克里姆林宫旁的红场上，在大庭广众面前，以这种方式把自己炸死？
    正当勃列日涅夫—柯西金叛徒集团在国际上加紧充当美帝头号帮凶，出卖世界人民的利益，在国内全面复辟资本主义，实行野蛮的法西斯统治的时候，发生这个事件绝不是偶然的。苏修领导集团企图掩盖苏联人民对他们的滔天罪行的愤慨和抗议，是枉费心机的。
