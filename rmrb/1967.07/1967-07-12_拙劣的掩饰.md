Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The counter-revolutionary business of the imperialist governments is done every day, but in words, in official documents, it is always full of righteousness and morality, or at least contains some righteousness and morality, and never tells the truth." The Soviet revisionist traitors have long since become, like the imperialists, swindlers who say all the right things but do all the wrong things.

After Khrushchev's secret talks with Johnson, he immediately put on an act at a press conference held at the United Nations, saying: "As long as the United States invades Vietnam, there can be no hope of improving Sino-American relations," and to improve Sino-American relations, "the United States must first stop the Vietnam War." Khrushchev's fine words are completely shameless lies.

It was this same Khrushchev who, more than a year ago, said: "When the Vietnam War is continuing, when bombs are being dropped on innocent people, it is unrealistic for Soviet leaders to meet with President Johnson." Over the past year, has the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam stopped? No, it has only intensified; have U.S. bombs stopped killing innocent Vietnamese people? No, they have only become more frenzied. Yet, Khrushchev shamelessly threw himself into Johnson's arms. This is not a clear indication that the Soviet revisionist clique is insincere?

On the one hand, they pretend to support the Vietnamese people, and on the other hand, they collude with U.S. imperialism in "comprehensive cooperation," using the hypocritical slogan of supporting the Vietnamese people to cover up the tightening of Soviet-American collusion. In recent years, as the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam has been continuously "escalated," the Soviet revisionists' "cooperation" with the U.S. imperialists has also been continuously "escalated," from secret collusion to open collusion. Whether it is cultural exchanges, economic cooperation; consular treaties, fishing agreements; preventing nuclear proliferation, anti-ballistic missiles... the number of areas and the scope are unprecedented, not to mention their "joint actions" in suppressing the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries.

Not only that, but the Soviet revisionists and the U.S. imperialists are also collaborating closely in their efforts to "induce peace" with the Vietnamese people. In this global deal with Johnson, Khrushchev not only betrayed the people of the Middle East but also betrayed the Vietnamese people. Johnson advocates so-called "gradual de-escalation," and Khrushchev also shouts about stopping the bombing first. This indicates that the two are once again plotting to play the "induce peace" trick together. The traitorous face of the Soviet revisionist clique as a major accomplice in the U.S. imperialist aggression against Vietnam has long been exposed, and no matter how Khrushchev tries to cover it up, it is obviously in vain.

### 拙劣的掩饰

    拙劣的掩饰
    毛主席曾经指出：“帝国主义政府的反革命事业尽管每天都在做，但是在嘴上，在官方的文书上，却总是满篇的仁义道德，或者多少带一些仁义道德，从来不说实话。”苏修叛徒也早已同帝国主义一样，堕落成为好话说尽、坏事做绝的江湖骗子了。
    柯西金刚同约翰逊密谈之后，马上就在联合国举行的记者招待会上装模作样地说：“只要美国侵略越南，就不能指望改善苏美关系”，要改善苏美关系，“美国首先要停止越南战争”。柯西金的这种漂亮话，完全是无耻的撒谎。
    就是这个柯西金，在一年多以前曾经说过：“当越南战争在继续进行的时候，当炸弹投向平白无辜的人们的时候，苏联领导人同约翰逊总统会晤是不现实的。”一年多以来，美帝国主义侵略越南的战争停止了吗？没有，而且是越来越扩大；美国的炸弹停止残杀无辜的越南人民了吗？没有，而且是越来越疯狂。然而，柯西金却不知羞耻地投进了约翰逊的怀抱。这不是充分表明苏修集团完全是言不由衷的吗？
    一面假装支持越南人民，一面同美帝国主义大搞“全面合作”，用支持越南人民的虚伪口号来掩饰苏美之间的加紧勾结，这是苏修集团的一贯伎俩。近年来，美帝国主义的侵越战争不断“升级”，而苏修同美帝的“合作”也是不断“升级”，从暗中的勾搭发展到了公开的勾结。什么文化交流，经济合作；什么领事条约，渔业协定；什么防止核扩散，反弹道导弹……方面之多，范围之广，真是前所未有，更不用说在镇压各国人民革命斗争中的“联合行动”了。
    不但这样，苏修同美帝在对越南人民诱“和”方面也合作得极其紧密。就在这一次同约翰逊进行的全球性交易当中，柯西金就不仅出卖了中东人民，而且也出卖了越南人民。约翰逊鼓吹所谓“逐步降级”，柯西金也叫嚷要首先停止轰炸，这预示它们两家又要合伙再次玩弄诱“和”的阴谋。苏修集团充当美帝国主义侵略越南大帮凶的叛徒面目，早已大暴露，柯西金不管怎样掩饰，显然都是徒劳的。
