The British colonial authorities in Hong Kong, defying our government's serious warnings, have resolutely chosen to oppose the Chinese people. In the early hours and afternoon of the 15th, they dispatched large numbers of military and police forces, along with secret agents, to once again brutally arrest two journalists from the Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch, five other patriotic journalists, and more than twenty patriotic compatriots. They also surrounded and attacked a patriotic school. The fascist atrocities of the British colonial authorities have sparked immense anger and strong protests from the patriotic people of Hong Kong and Kowloon.

On the afternoon of the 15th, around 5 PM, a delegation from the Hong Kong education community went to the British colonial "Government House" to strongly protest against the British colonial authorities' recent deployment of British troops and "riot control units" to violently surround and attack patriotic schools, as well as their persecution of patriotic teachers and students. At the time, journalists Chen Fengying and Chen Demu from the Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch, along with journalists from the Wen Wei Po, Ta Kung Pao, and Xin Wan Bao newspapers, were on the scene conducting interviews. Shortly after, a large number of British troops and Hong Kong "riot control units" arrived at the scene, rudely surrounding and arresting all the education community representatives who were protesting. Simultaneously, they rudely arrested the Xinhua journalists Chen Fengying and Chen Demu, as well as the five journalists from the aforementioned patriotic newspapers. Chen Fengying and Chen Demu immediately identified themselves as Xinhua journalists and lodged a strong protest, but the "riot control units" ignored them and forcibly put them and the other patriotic journalists onto police cars, detaining them at the "Central Police Station" and later transferring them to the "Victoria Detention Center."

Upon learning of the British colonial authorities' unreasonable detention of Xinhua and Hong Kong patriotic newspaper journalists, two other journalists from the Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch immediately rushed to the scene but were refused entry by the Hong Kong police. Plainclothes agents rudely drove them away, and despite the journalists' strong protests, they forcibly seized and searched a journalist's handbag.

Around 6 PM, Deputy Editor-in-Chief Pan Desheng of the Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch called the responsible person at the British colonial "Police Political Department" to lodge the strongest protest over this incident. He pointed out that the Xinhua journalists were conducting normal interviews at the scene and were illegally arrested by the Hong Kong "riot control units." The British colonial authorities must immediately release them. However, the other party used the excuse of "not knowing" to stall.

The Education Community Committee Against British Colonial Persecution issued a statement on the evening of the 15th, strongly protesting the British colonial authorities' fascist atrocity of arresting the education delegation. The statement pointed out: The British colonial authorities have gone mad, and in these past few days, their persecution of Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon has been escalating. Our comrades in the education community know how to deal with the British colonial authorities, and the vast number of young students we educate even more so. If the British colonial authorities do not stop, do not release our comrades, we will definitely mobilize more patriotic teachers and students to fight them to the end.

In the early hours of the 15th, around 2:30 AM, the British colonial fascist authorities dispatched a large number of police and secret agents to unreasonably abduct the patriotic film workers Fu Qi and Shi Hui. The fascist thugs, armed with carbines and pistols, used heavy objects and iron tools to break down the iron door. Without giving any reason, they arrested Fu Qi and Shi Hui and conducted a search that violated their personal freedom. Fu Qi and Shi Hui immediately lodged a serious protest against the British colonial authorities' fascist actions on the spot.

The Hong Kong and Kowloon Film Industry Struggle Committee, as well as struggle committees from some film companies and production studios, issued statements today, lodging the strongest and most serious protests against the British colonial authorities' unreasonable abduction of Fu Qi and Shi Hui. They demanded that the British colonial authorities immediately release them, ensure their personal safety, publicly apologize, and guarantee that such incidents will not happen again.

In the early hours of the 15th, the British colonial authorities also dispatched a company of British troops, a squad of auxiliary troops, and hundreds of "riot control units" and armed police to surround and forcibly search the patriotic school Fujian Middle School in the Western District of Hong Kong. Large numbers of military and police set up barbed wire and sandbag fortifications on the streets near Fujian Middle School, then launched attacks from multiple directions, using welding torches and other weapons to burn and break down the school's doors. They rushed into the school, conducting extensive searches, destruction, and looting. The evil British colonial authorities even smashed the statue of Chairman Mao inside the school, pierced and defaced portraits of Chairman Mao, and tore down large banners praising our great leader Chairman Mao.

Since the night of the 11th, the British colonial fascist authorities have repeatedly launched armed raids on our six patriotic institutions at night, five of which were carried out by the British colonial authorities deploying regular British troops and the Hong Kong Defense Force. Preliminary statistics show that in these incidents, the British colonial authorities have shot and killed one patriotic compatriot, injured dozens with guns and beatings, and arrested more than 130 people from patriotic institutions and nearby residents. Including today's afternoon incident at the "Governor's House," a total of 160 people have been arrested. The patriotic people of Hong Kong are outraged by the British colonial authorities' fascist bloody atrocities over the past few days. They have taken to the streets in Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the "New Territories," fiercely attacking the British colonial "riot control units." They warn the British colonial fascist authorities: You have escalated your atrocities to a serious level. The organized patriotic people of Hong Kong will definitely give you double the punishment.

    无视我政府严重警告　顽固与中国人民为敌
    港英当局又非法逮捕我记者和爱国同胞
    英帝的法西斯暴行激起了港九爱国同胞无比愤慨和强烈抗议
    新华社香港十五日电　港英法西斯当局不顾我国政府的严重警告，决心与中国人民为敌，十五日凌晨和下午，先后出动大批军警和特务，再一次疯狂地逮捕了新华社香港分社两名记者，及其他五名爱国记者，还有二十多名爱国同胞，另外还包围和袭击了一所爱国学校。港英的法西斯暴行激起了港九爱国同胞极大的愤怒。
    十五日下午五时左右，香港教育界代表团前往港英“总督府”，向“代理总督”祁济时强烈抗议港英当局连日出动英国陆军和“防暴队”，武力包围、袭击爱国学校以及迫害爱国师生的法西斯暴行。当时，新华社香港分社记者陈凤英和陈德穆，同香港文汇、大公、新晚等报的记者一起，正在现场进行采访。其后，大批英国陆军和港英“防暴队”到达现场，横蛮无理地包围并逮捕了教育界的全部抗议代表，同时还横蛮无理地逮捕了在场的新华社记者陈凤英和陈德穆两人，以及上述爱国报纸的五名记者。陈凤英和陈德穆两人当时立即表明新华社记者身份，并提出强烈抗议，但“防暴队”不加理睬，横蛮地把她们和其他爱国记者一起，用强力持上警车，扣押在“中央警署”，随后又转至“维多利亚拘留所”。
    在获悉港英法西斯当局无理拘捕新华社及香港爱国报纸的记者时，新华社香港分社另外两名记者立即赶到现场，但为港英警察拒绝进入，并派出便衣特务无理加以驱逐，还不顾记者提出强烈抗议，强行抢去一个记者的手提包进行检查。
    下午六时许，新华社香港分社副总编辑潘德声，打电话给港英“警务处政治部”负责人，就此事提出最强烈抗议，并指出新华社记者当时在现场进行正常的采访活动，是被港英“防暴队”非法逮捕的，港英当局必须立即释放。但是，对方却以“不知情”为借口加以推宕。
    教育界反对港英迫害斗争委员会十五日晚就此事发表声明，严重抗议港英当局逮捕教育代表团这一法西斯暴行。声明指出：港英当局疯狂到极点，在这几天内，对港九中国同胞的迫害连续升级。我们教育界的战友们是懂得怎样去对待港英的，我们所教育的广大青年学生更是懂得怎样去处理他们的。港英如果不住手，不释放我们的战友，我们就一定要动员更广大的爱国师生同它斗争到底。
    十五日凌晨二时半左右，港英法西斯当局还派出大批警察、特务，无理绑架了爱国电影工作者傅奇、石慧夫妇。法西斯暴徒拿着卡宾枪、手枪，用重物和铁器凿烂铁门，没有说明任何理由，便逮捕了傅奇和石慧，并进行了侵犯人身自由的搜身。傅奇和石慧对港英当局的这种法西斯行径当场提出了严重抗议。
    港九电影界斗委会以及一些影业公司和制片厂的斗委会，今天分别发表声明，对港英当局无理绑架傅奇、石慧提出最强烈、最严重的抗议，要求港英当局立即释放他们，保障他们的人身安全，公开道歉，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。
    港英当局在十五日凌晨，还出动了一连英国陆军、一队辅助陆军及数百名“防暴队”和武装警察，包围并强行搜查香港西区爱国学校福建中学。大批军警在福建中学附近街道上架起铁丝网，设置沙包掩体，然后分别从学校的正门、后门等处展开了数路进攻，用烧焊器及其它武器烧毁及凿开学校的门户，冲进学校，大肆搜索、破坏和劫掠。万恶的港英当局还悍然打碎学校内的毛主席塑像，戳穿及涂污毛主席画像，撕毁歌颂我们伟大领袖毛主席的大幅标语。
    从十一日晚以来，港英法西斯当局连续在夜间武装突袭了我六个爱国机构，其中有五个爱国机构是港英当局出动正规英军和香港防卫军来干的。初步统计，在这几次事件中港英枪杀我爱国同胞一人，枪伤和打伤数十人，逮捕了爱国机构人员及附近居民一百三十多人。包括今天下午在“港督府”门前制造的暴行在内，共有一百六十多人被捕。香港爱国同胞对港英当局几天来干下的法西斯血腥暴行，无不感到怒火冲天，他们纷纷走上街头，在香港、九龙和“新界”广大地区，痛击港英“防暴队”。他们警告港英法西斯当局：你们已把暴行升了严重的一级，组织起来的香港爱国同胞，定将给你们双倍的惩罚。
