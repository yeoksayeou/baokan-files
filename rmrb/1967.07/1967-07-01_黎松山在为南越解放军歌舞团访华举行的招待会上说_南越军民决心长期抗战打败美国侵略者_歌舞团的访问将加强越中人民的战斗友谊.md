Li Songshan, the acting head of the permanent representative office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China, held a reception tonight for the visit and performance of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe in China.

Relevant responsible persons Zhang Xiruo, Xu Yixin, Yuan Ziqin, Pan Zhenwu, Ding Xilin, and Zhou Yiping were invited to attend the reception.

Deputy Chief of Mission Le Cong Chi of the Embassy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in China also attended the reception.

Li Songshan spoke first at the reception. He said, the South Vietnamese Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe is honored to be dispatched by the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the Command of the Armed Forces to bring the fighting friendship, gratitude, and determination to resist the Americans of the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces and South Vietnamese cultural workers to China. The visit and performance of the Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe in China will contribute to the unbreakable fighting friendship between the two peoples of Vietnam and China.

After strongly condemning and exposing the heinous crimes committed by American imperialism in the war of aggression against Vietnam, he said, the entire military and civilian population of Vietnam is advancing with an irresistible momentum, striking back with even greater force against American imperialism and its lackeys and accomplices, determined to smash all the "escalation" activities and "peace talks" plots of the likes of Johnson. The people of South Vietnam have firmly declared that no matter what trials and sacrifices they have to endure, no matter if they have to fight for ten years, twenty years, or even longer, the military and civilian population of South Vietnam are determined to fight to the end and will definitely defeat the American aggressors, completely accomplish the glorious task of liberating the South, defending the North, and ultimately reunifying the country.

Li Songshan said, in their patriotic and just struggle, the people of South Vietnam have received the firm and great support of the Chinese government and people. On this occasion, he expressed the heartfelt thanks of the military and civilian population of South Vietnam to the beloved Chairman Mao, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people.

Zhang Xiruo, the director of the Foreign Affairs Cultural Commission, said in his speech that no matter how American imperialism plays with the two-faced tricks of "escalation" and "peace talks," no matter how imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries plot and collude with each other, the final victory will definitely belong to the heroic Vietnamese people. The Chinese people resolutely support the Vietnamese people's just struggle against American aggression and for national salvation. The Chinese people will always stand together with the Vietnamese people, fight together, and win together.

Zhang Xiruo said, the proletarian revolutionary faction of our country's cultural circles, following the teachings of Chairman Mao, wielding pens as swords, bravely engage in the battle, and will definitely bury the culture of the bourgeoisie, feudalism, and revisionism thoroughly! They will definitely make the heroic images of workers, peasants, and soldiers stand forever on the stage of proletarian culture! Our artists have created a series of models in drama, music, and dance. This is the fruit of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in literature and art, the victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Before the reception ended, the comrades of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe sang revolutionary songs reflecting the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression and songs praising our great leader Chairman Mao, such as "Navigating the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and "Long Live Chairman Mao!"

    越南民主共和国驻中国大使馆临时代办黎终始也出席了招待会。
    黎松山在招待会上首先讲话。他说，越南南方解放军歌舞团荣幸地得到越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会和武装力量指挥部的派遣，把越南南方人民解放武装力量和南方文艺工作者对中国人民、中国人民解放军和文艺工作者的战斗友谊、感谢的心情和抗美的决心带到了中国。解放军歌舞团在中国的访问演出，将对越中两国人民牢不可破的战斗友谊作出贡献。
    他在强烈谴责和揭露美帝国主义在侵越战争中所犯的滔天罪行以后说，越南全体军民，正以排山倒海之势，乘胜前进，给予美帝国主义及其走狗和帮凶军以更有力的打击，决心粉碎约翰逊之流的一切战争“升级”活动和“和谈”阴谋。越南南方人民已经坚强表明，无论要承担多么大的考验和牺牲，无论要进行十年、二十年或者更长时间的战斗，越南南方军民决心打到底，并且一定能打败美国侵略者，彻底完成解放南方，保卫北方，进而统一祖国的光荣任务。
    黎松山说，越南南方人民在自己爱国正义的斗争中，获得中国政府和中国人民所给予的坚决、巨大的支持，趁此机会，向敬爱的毛主席、中国政府和中国人民表达越南南方军民的衷心感谢。
    对外文委主任张奚若在讲话中说，无论美帝国主义怎样玩弄战争“升级”和“和谈”反革命两手阴谋，无论帝国主义、修正主义和反动派怎样策划，相互勾结，最后胜利必定属于英雄的越南人民。中国人民坚决支持越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争，中国人民永远和越南人民团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    张奚若说，我国文艺界的无产阶级革命派，遵循毛主席的教导，拿笔作刀枪，英勇地投入战斗，一定要把资产阶级、封建主义、修正主义的文化彻底埋葬！一定让工农兵群众的英雄形象永远屹立在无产阶级的文艺舞台上！我国艺术家们在戏剧、音乐、舞蹈各个方面创作了一系列的样板，这是毛主席革命文艺路线的成果，是毛泽东思想的胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利。
    在招待会结束前，越南南方解放军歌舞团战友们，演唱了反映越南人民抗美救国战争的革命歌曲和《大海航行靠舵手》、《万岁！毛主席》等歌颂我们伟大领袖毛主席的歌曲。
