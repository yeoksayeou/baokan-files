	The reactionary Burmese government is the chief culprit in the persecution of our patriotic overseas Chinese. Our government has decided to dispatch an aircraft to evacuate severely injured overseas Chinese back to China for treatment. Minister Counselor Xiao Ming has strongly protested against the Burmese government's fascist atrocities of detaining overseas Chinese students.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, July 4th: Rangoon news: On the 3rd, the Chinese Embassy in Burma, acting on instructions, sent a note to the Burmese government stating that the Chinese government has decided to dispatch a civilian aircraft to Burma immediately to evacuate patriotic overseas Chinese who have been severely injured by mobs organized and manipulated by the Burmese government back to China for treatment.

	The note states: The People's Republic of China, out of concern and care for overseas Chinese, has decided to dispatch a civilian aircraft to Burma immediately to evacuate patriotic overseas Chinese who have been injured by mobs organized and manipulated by the Burmese government back to China for treatment. For this purpose, the Chinese Embassy requests the Burmese government to:

	1. Immediately give a formal reply to the Chinese government's dispatch of a civilian aircraft to Burma to evacuate injured overseas Chinese.
	2. Dispatch responsible officials to accompany embassy diplomatic personnel and representatives of overseas Chinese organizations to immediately visit the injured overseas Chinese.
	3. Quickly issue entry and exit visas for severely injured overseas Chinese and make all necessary arrangements for their entry and exit from Burma.

	The note sternly points out that the Burmese government has organized and manipulated mobs to kill and injure countless overseas Chinese, committing heinous crimes against the Chinese people and destroying the friendly relations between China and Burma. The Burmese government owes a blood debt to the Chinese government and people. The Burmese government is the chief culprit in the persecution of overseas Chinese. The Burmese government must arrange for the injured overseas Chinese to return to China for treatment; otherwise, all consequences will be the responsibility of the Burmese government.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, July 4th: Rangoon news: On the 3rd, Minister Counselor Xiao Ming, acting on instructions from the People's Republic of China, handed a note to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, strongly protesting against the Burmese government's illegal arrest and unreasonable detention of a large number of patriotic overseas Chinese students, and demanding to visit and comfort the persecuted patriotic overseas Chinese students. The note states: The Burmese reactionary government, in order to achieve its evil purposes of anti-China and anti-Chinese, has continued to illegally arrest thousands of patriotic overseas Chinese students since June 26th and unreasonably detained them in detention camps. This is another fascist atrocity you have committed. We express our utmost indignation and strongest protest against your blatant persecution of innocent overseas Chinese students and your hostility towards the People's Republic of China.

	The note states: Overseas Chinese students residing in Burma have the sacred and inviolable right to love their motherland, love the Chinese people, and love the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao. No one has the right to deprive them of this right. The note states: We have, on instructions from the Chinese government, repeatedly negotiated and struggled with you, demanding that you immediately allow diplomatic personnel to visit the military detention camps to visit and comfort the patriotic overseas Chinese students who have been persecuted by the Burmese government. However, you have not responded to this completely reasonable and legitimate demand, delaying it to this day without making any arrangements. This fully proves that you are guilty, extremely afraid of sunlight, afraid of truth, and afraid that your heinous crimes will be exposed to the world.

	The note states: We once again sternly demand that the Burmese government immediately arrange for our embassy's diplomatic personnel to visit the military detention camps to visit and comfort the overseas Chinese students. If the Burmese government continues to delay or conspire to sabotage the embassy's visit to the persecuted overseas Chinese students, all consequences will be the responsibility of the Burmese government.

　　缅反动政府是残害我爱国侨胞的罪魁祸首
　　我政府决定派机接运重伤华侨回国治疗
　　肖明临时代办强烈抗议缅政府拘留华侨学生的法西斯暴行
    新华社四日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆三日奉命照会缅甸政府：中国政府决定派遣民航班机立即到缅甸接运被缅甸政府组织和操纵的暴徒毒打重伤的爱国侨胞返回中国进行治疗。
    照会说：中华人民共和国政府出于对华侨的关怀和爱护决定派遣民航班机立即到缅甸接运被缅甸政府组织和操纵的暴徒打伤的爱国侨胞返回中国进行治疗。为此，中国大使馆要求缅甸政府：
    一、对中国政府派遣民航班机来缅接运受伤华侨事立即作出正式答复。
    二、派遣负责官员陪同大使馆外交人员，侨团代表立即前往探视受伤华侨。
    三、迅速发给重伤华侨出入缅甸的来回签证并为他们出入缅甸作出一切安排。
    照会严正指出，缅甸政府制造反华排华运动，组织和操纵暴徒残杀和打伤了无数华侨，对中国人民犯下了滔天罪行，一手破坏了中缅两国的友好关系。缅甸政府对中国政府和人民欠下了血债。缅甸政府是残害华侨的罪魁祸首。缅甸政府必须安排受伤华侨返回中国治疗，否则一切后果必须由缅甸政府负责。
    新华社四日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆临时代办肖明奉中华人民共和国政府之命，三日向缅甸外交部递交一份照会，强烈抗议缅甸政府非法逮捕和无理拘留大批爱国华侨学生，严正要求探望和慰问遭受迫害的爱国华侨学生。照会指出：缅甸反动政府为了达到反华、排华的罪恶目的，自六月二十六日起继续非法逮捕了数以千计的爱国华侨学生并无理将他们关在拘留营内。这是你们犯下的又一法西斯暴行。我们对于你们公然迫害无辜华侨学生，敌视中华人民共和国的这一行径表示最大的愤慨和最强烈的抗议。
    照会说：侨居缅甸的华侨学生热爱祖国、热爱中国人民和全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席是他们神圣不可侵犯的权利，任何人无权剥夺。照会说：我们奉中国政府指示多次与你们交涉斗争，要求立即允许外交人员前往缅军方拘留营探望和慰问受缅甸政府迫害的爱国华侨学生。但是，你们对于这一完全正当和合理的要求竟不予置理，拖延至今不予安排。这充分证明你们作贼心虚，极端害怕阳光，害怕真理，害怕你们的滔天罪行被公诸于世。
    照会说：我们再次严正要求缅甸政府立即安排我使馆外交人员前往缅军方拘留营探望和慰问华侨学生。如缅甸政府继续拖延，或玩弄阴谋破坏大使馆探望受难华侨学生，一切后果由缅甸政府负责。
