Forty years ago, after the Kuomintang had completely betrayed the revolution, under the condition that the correct line represented by Chairman Mao had defeated the right-opportunist line of Chen Duxiu, and under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Nanchang Uprising on August 1st fired the first shot against the Kuomintang reactionaries.

Under the personal leadership of Chairman Mao, the great historical significance of the Autumn Harvest Uprising and the march to Jinggangshan began to establish a completely new type of people's army, established the first revolutionary base area, and opened up the revolutionary road for the vanguard of the proletariat to go deep into the countryside, lead the peasants in armed struggle, establish rural base areas, and surround the cities with the countryside to seize national power. This road is not only the only correct road for the Chinese people to achieve revolutionary victory, but also the brilliant road for the proletariat and all oppressed peoples and nations around the world to struggle for liberation.

Over the past forty years, under the leadership of our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao, guided by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the People's Liberation Army has gone through an extremely arduous and tortuous, extremely glorious and magnificent journey. Relying on the great People's Liberation Army, we spent twenty-two years to overthrow the reactionary rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, seize national power, and establish a great state of proletarian dictatorship. Relying on the great People's Liberation Army, in the eighteen years since the founding of the nation, we have smashed the armed attacks and subversive plots of domestic and foreign class enemies, bravely defended the socialist motherland, and supported the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries. The People's Liberation Army is the strongest pillar of proletarian dictatorship in our country and the strongest backing for all oppressed nations and peoples.

The great achievements of the People's Liberation Army over the past forty years have shocked the world, and are the great victories of Chairman Mao's military theory and Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "From the viewpoint of Marxism on the state, the army is the main component of state power. Whoever wants to seize state power and wants to maintain it must have a powerful army."

The history of the Chinese revolution proves that the proletariat must have a new type of highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready people's army to seize power and consolidate power. Without a people's army built according to Mao Zedong Thought, everything is empty talk.

In the long-term struggle against domestic and foreign class enemies, Comrade Mao Zedong brilliantly created the most complete, most systematic, and greatest proletarian military theory. Chairman Mao's famous proposition that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," that "without a people's army, there is nothing for the people," his brilliant ideas on building the army politically first and strengthening the political and ideological work of the army, his important principle that "the party commands the gun, and the gun must never command the party," his great theory of people's army and people's war, have pushed the military science of Marxism-Leninism to a new stage. It is the most powerful and sharpest weapon for the proletariat and revolutionary people around the world to defeat imperialism, modern revisionism, and all reactionaries.

In the struggle over armed struggle and army building, there have always been two lines within our party. One is the proletarian military line represented by Chairman Mao, and the other is the bourgeois military line pursued by "left" and right opportunists. Chairman Mao's proletarian military line has been continuously developed and perfected in the struggle against the bourgeois military line and in the process of criticizing Chen Duxiu, Li Lisan, Wang Ming, Zhang Guotao, and the Chinese Khrushchev and other representatives of the bourgeoisie within the party.

The Chinese Khrushchev has always opposed Chairman Mao's correct line and practiced class capitulationism. During the War of Resistance Against Japan, he openly advocated handing over the people's army to the "National Government" for "leadership" and praised the public enemy Chiang Kai-shek as a "revolutionary banner." After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he once again fervently advocated the parliamentary road, advocated surrendering to the Kuomintang and disarming, and shamelessly shouted that "the army takes a step back, the whole country makes great progress."

Chairman Mao thoroughly criticized and smashed the Chinese Khrushchev's line of abolishing the people's army and armed struggle, thus enabling our army to develop and grow stronger and achieve great victories in the people's revolutionary wars.

After the founding of the great People's Republic of China, the Chinese Khrushchev continued to oppose Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fiercely opposed proletarian dictatorship, and attempted to restore capitalism. He colluded with a small handful of bourgeois representatives who had infiltrated the party and the army, and carried out frenzied plots to seize the party, seize power, and seize the army. His agents in the army were the anti-party, anti-army, and counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, who were exposed at the Lushan Conference in 1959 and shortly before the Cultural Revolution. They were time bombs buried in the party and the army, the most dangerous enemies of proletarian dictatorship. For a long time, under the support of the Chinese Khrushchev, the biggest power-holder within the party who was taking the capitalist road, they stubbornly pursued the bourgeois military line, attempting to turn the great People's Liberation Army into a tool for personal ambition and a tool for restoring capitalism.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist elements Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing were most afraid of the great Mao Zedong Thought and most afraid of the combination of Mao Zedong Thought with the broad cadre and soldiers. They maliciously attacked and slandered Chairman Mao, and fiercely resisted and opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian political and military lines. The important instructions of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee on military work were either deliberately blocked and not conveyed, or were followed in name but opposed in fact, using two-faced tactics. They emphasized standardization and modernization one-sidedly, denied revolutionization, and denied the glorious tradition of political work in our army. They fiercely opposed the prominence of proletarian politics and attempted to lead the army astray. They opposed Chairman Mao's people's war theory, opposed the universal militia system, and destroyed the traditional system of combining the main forces, local forces, and militia guerrilla forces. They pursued this set of bourgeois military lines precisely to fundamentally change the nature of our army and attempt to turn it into a bourgeois old army that is detached from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, detached from the masses, and stands against the masses.

Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, this gang of anti-party conspirators, pursued the bourgeois military line to serve the reactionary political line of the small handful of power-holders within the party who were taking the capitalist road and opposed proletarian dictatorship and restored capitalism. It was the manifestation of this reactionary political line in the military.

The exposure of the anti-party conspirators Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and a great victory in smashing the plot to restore capitalism.

In the struggle between the two lines within the party and the army, Comrade Lin Biao has always been the most loyal, most resolute, and most thorough in implementing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and military thought. Over the past forty years, at every major historical juncture, he has always stood firmly on Chairman Mao's side, waged uncompromising struggles against erroneous lines, and bravely defended Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Since Comrade Lin Biao took charge of the work of the Central Military Commission, he has called on the entire army to study and apply Chairman Mao's works creatively, proposed the thought of the "four firsts," proposed the "three-eights style," advocated the "three democracies," and launched the "four good" company movement. This series of principles, policies, and major measures for army building have pushed the construction of our army to a new stage and have great and far-reaching significance for turning the entire army and the whole country into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Lin Biao is Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms and best student, and is a veteran and outstanding leader of our party. His works such as "Long Live the Victory of People's War" systematically expound and develop Chairman Mao's military thought and are brilliant examples of the creative application of Mao Zedong Thought.

The People's Liberation Army is responsible for the glorious task of consolidating national defense and defending proletarian dictatorship. To accomplish this great historical task, the most important thing is to strengthen the leadership of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, to strengthen the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, to establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and to ensure that all cadres and soldiers in the army can, in the face of any class struggle storms, loyally defend Chairman Mao, defend the Party Central Committee, and defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao.

In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the People's Liberation Army responded to Chairman Mao's great call, actively participated in the revolutionary mass movement, and achieved great success and new merits in the "three supports, two militaries" work.

At present, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution throughout the country is in a great situation. However, the class struggle is extremely sharp and complex. The broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army must fully recognize the great role of the army in this struggle, firmly support the proletarian revolutionaries, and share their breath and destiny. The proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses must believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army and support the People's Liberation Army. The military and civilian people of the whole country must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call to "support the army and love the people," unite closely, and in any situation, be loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, loyal to the great Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to Chairman Mao and his closest comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

The People's Liberation Army, which has been tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and has greatly enhanced its combat effectiveness, will certainly be able to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, make greater and new contributions to the defense of the socialist motherland, support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries, and fight against imperialism led by the United States, modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and all their accomplices, for the people of our country and the people of the world.

Long live the great People's Liberation Army!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the great Communist Party of China!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live our great leader and great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao!

    无产阶级专政最坚强的支柱
    ——纪念中国人民解放军建军四十周年
    四十年前，在国民党完全叛变革命之后，在以毛主席为代表的正确路线战胜了陈独秀右倾机会主义路线的条件下，在毛泽东思想的指引下，八一南昌起义打响了反对国民党反动派的第一枪。
    毛主席亲自领导的具有伟大历史意义的秋收起义和向井冈山进军，开始创立了一支完全新型的人民军队，建立了第一个革命根据地，开辟了无产阶级先锋队深入农村，领导农民进行武装斗争，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，夺取全国政权的革命道路。这条道路，不仅是中国人民取得革命胜利的唯一正确道路，也是全世界无产阶级和一切被压迫人民、被压迫民族争取解放的光辉道路。
    四十年来，在我们伟大统帅毛主席的率领下，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，中国人民解放军走过了极其艰难曲折、极其光荣伟大的路程。依靠伟大的人民解放军，我们花了二十二年的时间，推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的反动统治，夺取了全国政权，建立了无产阶级专政的伟大国家。依靠伟大的人民解放军，我们在建国后的十八年中，粉碎了国内外阶级敌人的武装进攻和颠覆破坏阴谋，英勇地保卫了社会主义祖国，支援了世界各国人民的革命斗争。中国人民解放军，是我国无产阶级专政的最坚强的支柱，是全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民的最强大的后盾。
    中国人民解放军四十年来所取得的震惊世界的丰功伟绩，是毛主席军事理论的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    毛主席指出：“从马克思主义关于国家学说的观点看来，军队是国家政权的主要成份。谁想夺取国家政权，并想保持它，谁就应有强大的军队。”
    中国革命的历史证明，无产阶级要夺取政权和巩固政权，必须有一支新型的非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的人民军队。没有一支按照毛泽东思想建立起来的人民军队，一切都是空谈。
    在同国内外阶级敌人的长期斗争中，毛泽东同志天才地创立了最完整、最系统、最伟大的无产阶级军事理论。毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”、“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”的著名论断，关于首先从政治上建军、加强军队政治思想工作的光辉思想，关于“党指挥枪，而决不容许枪指挥党”的重要原则，关于人民军队，人民战争的伟大理论，把马克思列宁主义的军事学说推进到一个崭新的阶段。它是全世界无产阶级和革命人民战胜帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派的最强大、最锐利的武器。
    在武装斗争和军队建设的问题上，我们党内一直存在着两条路线的尖锐斗争。一条是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级军事路线，一条是“左”、右倾机会主义者所推行的资产阶级军事路线。毛主席的无产阶级军事路线，就是在同资产阶级军事路线的斗争中，在批判陈独秀、李立三、王明、张国焘以及中国赫鲁晓夫等党内资产阶级代表人物的过程中，不断发展和完善起来的。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫，一贯地反对毛主席的正确路线，实行阶级投降主义。在抗日战争时期，他公然主张把人民的军队交给“国民政府”去“领导”，吹捧人民公敌蒋介石是什么“革命的旗帜”。抗日战争胜利后，他又一次狂热地鼓吹议会道路，主张向国民党缴枪投降，无耻地叫喊什么“军队让一步，全国大进步”。
    毛主席彻底批判和粉碎了中国赫鲁晓夫取消人民军队，取消武装斗争的投降主义路线，从而使我们的军队不断发展壮大，取得了人民革命战争的伟大胜利。
    伟大的中华人民共和国建立以后，中国的赫鲁晓夫继续同毛主席的无产阶级革命路线相对抗，猖狂反对无产阶级专政，力图搞资本主义复辟。他纠合混进党内、军内的一小撮资产阶级代表人物，疯狂进行篡党、篡政、篡军的阴谋活动。他在军内的代理人，就是在一九五九年庐山会议上揭露出来的和文化大革命前不久被揪出来的反党篡军的反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿。他们是埋在党内军内的定时炸弹，是无产阶级专政的最危险的敌人。长期以来，他们在中国的赫鲁晓夫、党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，顽固地推行资产阶级军事路线，妄图把伟大的人民解放军变成个人野心家的工具，变成复辟资本主义的工具。
    反革命修正主义分子彭德怀、罗瑞卿，最害怕伟大的毛泽东思想，最害怕毛泽东思想和广大干部战士相结合。他们恶毒地攻击和诽谤毛主席，疯狂地抵制和反对毛主席的无产阶级政治路线和军事路线。毛主席、党中央对军队工作的重要指示，他们或者竭力封锁，拒不传达；或者阳奉阴违，两面三刀，打着红旗反红旗。他们片面强调正规化、现代化，否定革命化，否定我军政治工作的光荣传统。他们竭力反对突出无产阶级政治，妄图把军队引到邪路上去。他们反对毛主席的人民战争思想，反对普遍民兵制，破坏主力军、地方军和民兵游击队相结合的传统体制。他们推行这套资产阶级军事路线，就是为了从根本上改变我军的性质，妄图使它变成一支脱离毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，脱离人民群众，站在群众对立面的资产阶级旧军队。
    彭德怀、罗瑞卿这伙反党野心家，推行资产阶级的军事路线，是为党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派反对无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义的反动的政治路线服务的，是这条反动的政治路线在军事上的表现。
  彭德怀、罗瑞卿等反党野心家被揭露出来，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的重大胜利，是粉碎资本主义复辟阴谋的重大胜利。
    在党内军内两条路线的斗争中，林彪同志一贯最忠实、最坚决、最彻底地贯彻执行了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和军事思想。四十年来，在每一个重大的历史关头，他总是坚定地站在毛主席一边，同错误路线进行不调和的斗争，英勇地捍卫了毛泽东思想，捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。
    林彪同志主持中央军委工作以来，号召全军指战员活学活用毛主席著作，创造性地提出了四个第一的思想，提出了大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好连队运动。这一系列关于军队建设的方针、原则和重大措施，把我军的建设推进到一个新阶段，对于把全军和全国办成毛泽东思想的大学校，具有伟大的深远的意义。
    林彪同志是毛主席最亲密的战友，最好的学生，是我们党久经考验的卓越的领导人。他所著的《人民战争胜利万岁》等书，系统地阐明和发挥了毛主席的军事思想，是创造性地运用毛泽东思想的光辉典范。
    人民解放军担负着巩固国防和保卫无产阶级专政的光荣任务。要完成这个伟大的历史任务，最最重要的，就是加强以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线的领导，加强以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导，就是要树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，使全军指战员在任何阶级斗争的风浪面前，都能够赤胆忠心地保卫毛主席，保卫党中央，保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，人民解放军响应毛主席的伟大号召，积极投入革命的群众运动的洪流，在“三支”“两军”工作中，取得了巨大成绩，立下了新功。
    当前，全国的无产阶级文化大革命是一片大好形势。但是，阶级斗争十分尖锐复杂。人民解放军的广大指战员，一定要充分认识到解放军在这场斗争中的伟大作用，坚决地支持无产阶级革命派，同他们同呼吸，共命运。无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，要相信和依靠人民解放军，拥护人民解放军。全国军民要坚决响应毛主席“拥军爱民”的号召，紧密团结起来，在任何情况下，都忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，忠于伟大的毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席和他的最亲密战友林彪同志，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    经过无产阶级文化大革命锻炼而大大地提高了战斗力的人民解放军，一定能够更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，在保卫社会主义祖国，支援世界各国人民的革命斗争中，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义、以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义及其一切帮凶的斗争中，为我国人民和世界人民作出更加伟大的新贡献。
    伟大的中国人民解放军万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们的伟大领袖、伟大统帅毛主席万岁！
