	No Way Out in a Dead End
	McNamara's Ninth Visit to Saigon Cannot Save the Failed Invasion of Vietnam

	U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara, in an attempt to strategize further expansion of the Vietnam War and salvage the U.S. imperialists' failing situation in Vietnam, concluded his five-day conspiratorial activities in South Vietnam and departed Saigon on the 11th, returning to the United States.

	McNamara was originally scheduled to visit South Vietnam in mid-June. Due to his participation in the Johnson-Kosygin Glassboro talks, the visit was postponed until recently. During the Glassboro talks, Kosygin further capitulated to U.S. imperialism on the Vietnam issue, striking a secret deal with Johnson, allowing U.S. imperialism, with the tacit approval and support of the Soviet revisionist clique, to intensify its counter-revolutionary schemes of war and "peace" against the Vietnamese people. McNamara's visit to South Vietnam took place against this backdrop.

	The reason for McNamara's visit to South Vietnam this time was that the U.S. invading forces suffered a severe defeat in the so-called "dry season offensive," prompting an urgent request to Washington for reinforcements. The Associated Press reported upon McNamara's departure for South Vietnam that "the United States is now facing a decisive moment in Vietnam"; the U.S. invaders are not only seeing entire companies of troops being wiped out but entire battalions being forced to withdraw from the battlefield due to dangerously low troop levels. To cope with the "significantly worsening" military situation, the U.S. military leaders in Saigon demanded an immediate increase of 70,000 to 150,000 troops.

	However, it is no easy task for Washington to meet Saigon's demands. According to Reuters, if the United States were to send another 70,000 troops to South Vietnam, it could "drastically increase military spending, mobilize reserve forces, and cause inflation." If the Johnson administration were to do this, it would inevitably provoke even stronger opposition from the American people to the Vietnam War. Internal disputes within the U.S. ruling class would also become more intense. McNamara's visit to South Vietnam was an attempt to find a way out of this predicament.

	McNamara, who was terrified by the South Vietnamese people, did not dare to reveal the specific date of his departure before going to South Vietnam due to fear of "destruction." Upon arriving in Saigon on the 7th, he immediately plunged into the U.S. military headquarters in Vietnam, listening to reports on military, political, and "pacification" plans, and plotting further steps to escalate the Vietnam War with the U.S. military leaders in Vietnam, including the so-called "mining of Haiphong Harbor" and "bombing of North Vietnam." It was revealed that the so-called "military experts" of the U.S. invading forces in Vietnam believed that to achieve a "quick victory," 200,000 more U.S. troops were needed. However, where could so many troops come from? McNamara obviously did not dare to agree to this outright. Instead, he demanded the "maximum utilization" of all available U.S. military units and the strengthening of the combat effectiveness of the puppet army. According to the United Press International, McNamara wanted to solve the problem of insufficient troops by sending U.S. military logistics personnel and more puppet troops to the front lines. This means that in this visit to South Vietnam, he found a solution that was not a solution.

	Therefore, upon leaving Saigon, McNamara had to admit that the United States had "not eliminated the enemy's threat in South Vietnam" and that the "pacification plan" would "not have dramatic progress in the future."

	Over the past six years, McNamara has visited South Vietnam nine times. Each visit was at a critical juncture in the U.S. Vietnam War, always escalating the war significantly. This time is no exception. However, the result of each of McNamara's visits to South Vietnam has proven that the more U.S. imperialism expands the war, the more disastrous the failure. This visit to South Vietnam only further exposed the desperate plight of the U.S. imperialism, which is strong on the outside but weak on the inside, in South Vietnam. As the Washington Post acknowledged, McNamara "seemed to look into a long tunnel and see no light at the end."

### 死胡同里哪能找到活路  麦克纳马拉九访西贡也无法挽救侵越败局

    死胡同里哪能找到活路
    麦克纳马拉九访西贡也无法挽救侵越败局
    美国国防部长麦克纳马拉为了策划进一步扩大侵越战争，挽救美帝国主义在越南的败局，在南越进行了五天阴谋活动以后，已经在十一日离开西贡，返回美国。
    麦克纳马拉原定在六月中旬访问南越。由于他要参加约翰逊同柯西金的葛拉斯堡罗会谈，所以推迟到最近。在葛拉斯堡罗会谈中，柯西金在越南问题上进一步向美帝国主义屈膝投降，同约翰逊做成了秘密交易，使美帝国主义得以在苏修集团的默契和支持下，加紧对越南人民推行战、“和”两手的反革命阴谋活动。麦克纳马拉对南越的访问，就是在这个背景下进行的。
    麦克纳马拉这次访问南越，是因为美国侵略军在所谓“旱季攻势”中遭到了惨败，向华盛顿提出了形势危急和赶快增兵的紧急要求。美联社在麦克纳马拉前往南越的时候报道说，“美国在越南正面临一个决定性的时刻”；美国侵略者现在不但“整连整连的军队被打垮，而且整营整营的军队由于兵力被削弱到危险水平之下而不得不撤出战场”。为了应付“显著恶化”的军事形势，西贡的美军头子要求马上增加侵略军七万人到十五万人。
    但是，华盛顿要满足西贡的要求又是谈何容易呢？据路透社说，美国如果要向南越再增兵七万人，就可能“使军事开支急剧上升，动员后备部队，造成通货膨胀，除了已要求国会通过百分之六的附加税以外再增加税收”。约翰逊政府要是这样做，势必引起美国人民对侵越战争的更强烈的反对。美国统治集团内部的争吵也将更加激烈，麦克纳马拉这次去南越，就是要从没有办法之中想出办法来。
    被南越人民吓破了胆的麦克纳马拉，在去南越之前，由于害怕“破坏的危险”，连动身的具体日期都不敢透露。他在七日到达西贡之后，就一头钻进侵越美军总部，听取关于军事、政治和“绥靖计划”的“汇报”，同侵越美军头子策划进一步扩大侵越战争的步骤，包括所谓对“海防港布雷”和“轰炸北越”等等。据透露，侵越美军的所谓“军事专家”认为，如果要取得“迅速胜利”，需要再增加美军二十万人。可是，这么多兵力究竟从何而来呢？麦克纳马拉显然不敢一口答应下来。相反，他倒是要求“最大限度地利用”现在可以利用的一切美军部队和加强伪军的战斗力。据合众国际社说，麦克纳马拉所以要打这个算盘，是因为在南越的四十多万美国侵略军中，实际用于作战的部队只有六万人，其余都是替这些少爷兵担任后勤、支援工作的。所以，麦克纳马拉就想用把侵越美军的后勤人员和更多的伪军赶上火线的办法来解决兵力不足的问题。这也就是说，他在这次南越之行中找到的，还是一个不是办法的办法。
    因此，麦克纳马拉在离开西贡的时候不得不承认，美国在南越战场上“丝毫没有消除敌人的威胁”，“绥靖计划”“在将来也不会有戏剧性的进展”。
    六年来，麦克纳马拉已经去了南越九次。他每去一次，都是在美国侵越战争面临危急的关头，总是把侵越战争大大升级一次。这一次当然也是如此。但是，麦克纳马拉的每一次南越之行的结果都证明，美帝国主义越是扩大战争，就失败得越惨。现在这一次南越之行，只能更加充分暴露出外强中干的美帝国主义在南越黔驴技穷的窘态。正如《华盛顿邮报》所承认的，麦克纳马拉“好象望进一个长长的隧道而看不到顶头的一线亮光”。
