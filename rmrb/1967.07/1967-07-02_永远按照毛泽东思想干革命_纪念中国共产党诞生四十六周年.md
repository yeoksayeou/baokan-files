On the occasion of the 46th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China, we, all the officers and soldiers, enthusiastically cheer from the bottom of our hearts:

Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!

Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!

Long live the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

The 46-year struggle of our Party has repeatedly proven that the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times—great Mao Zedong Thought—is the sole correct guide for the Chinese revolution and the strongest ideological weapon of the proletariat. As Comrade Lin Biao has pointed out, the reasons for the victory of the Chinese revolution are many, but the main and decisive reason is that we have Mao Zedong Thought.

The history of our Party is the history of the development of Mao Zedong Thought, the history of the victory of Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line over various "left" and right opportunist lines, and the history of the victory of Mao Zedong Thought over various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies.

Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the First Revolutionary Civil War and the Second Revolutionary Civil War both achieved great victories; but due to the erroneous leadership of the right and "left" opportunist lines of Chen Duxiu, Li Lisan, Wang Ming, and others, these two revolutionary wars finally suffered failures and severe setbacks. At the critical juncture of the revolution, it was Chairman Mao who saved the Chinese revolution, turning failure into victory. The Zunyi Conference established Chairman Mao's leadership in the Party Central Committee, and since then, under the great banner of Mao Zedong, the Chinese revolution has advanced from victory to victory. However, the struggle between the two lines has not stopped. In the early stages of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the capitulationist line of Wang Ming and Peng Dehuai emerged. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the largest capitalist-roaders within the Party openly advocated the parliamentary road and the abandonment of armed struggle, a capitulationist line. Great Mao Zedong Thought defeated the right-opportunist current, guiding the Chinese people to achieve nationwide victory.

After the national victory, over the past 17 years, the largest capitalist-roaders within the Party have been stubbornly pushing a bourgeois reactionary line, attempting to turn our Party into a revisionist party and implement capitalism in China. If this plot succeeds, our great motherland will change color, and the Chinese revolution and world revolution will suffer a major setback. Due to the wise leadership of our great helmsman Chairman Mao, the plot to restore capitalism was timely smashed, ensuring that the ship of the Chinese revolution sails forward victoriously towards socialism and communism.

The conclusion of history is this: No other ideology, no other line, works except Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Only Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line work. Under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, no matter what storms or difficulties arise, the revolution can advance rapidly, leap forward, and achieve one great victory after another. Conversely, without Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, even if the objective situation is good, the revolution will suffer setbacks and fail. Having Chairman Mao's wise leadership is the greatest happiness of the entire Party and the people of the whole country. We must carry out the revolution according to Mao Zedong Thought and never use any other ideology to carry out the revolution. This was true in the past, is true today, and will be true in the future, forever.

Mao Zedong Thought concentrates the highest interests of the proletariat and the broad masses of laboring people. To carry out the revolution according to Mao Zedong Thought and implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we must overcome the resistance and interference of various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies within the revolutionary ranks.

Chairman Mao has always placed great importance on ideological struggle and education within the revolutionary ranks. As early as in the article "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Thoughts," Chairman Mao pointed out: "Within the Communist Party of the Fourth Red Army, there exist various non-proletarian thoughts, which greatly hinder the implementation of the Party's correct line. If these are not thoroughly rectified, the great revolutionary struggle of China will inevitably be unable to be undertaken by the Fourth Red Army." During the great rectification movement in our Party's history, Chairman Mao taught us: "To complete the task of defeating the enemy, we must complete the task of rectifying the Party's style. ... As long as our Communist Party's ranks are in order and our steps are unified, our soldiers are elite soldiers, and our weapons are good weapons, then any powerful enemy can be defeated by us." At the Seventh National Congress of the Party, Chairman Mao pointed out: "Mastering ideological education is the central link in uniting the entire Party for great political struggles. If this task is not completed, the Party's political tasks cannot be completed."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolutionary movement initiated and led by Chairman Mao. Mao Zedong Thought is the great guide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. In any department and any place, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution cannot be separated from the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought for a single moment. Facts tell us that wherever the line, principles, and policies stipulated by Chairman Mao are strictly followed, the masses are trusted, relied upon, and mobilized, the direction of the struggle is firmly grasped, and the two types of contradictions are correctly distinguished and handled, the revolution there will be in a great situation, the mass movement will be vigorous and solid, and healthy development will be achieved, and the revolution's great alliance and the revolution's "three-in-one combination" will be smoothly realized for the proletariat to seize, hold, and use power well. Conversely, wherever the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line has not been thoroughly eliminated, wherever the interference of non-proletarian thoughts is significant, and wherever Mao Zedong Thought is not seriously followed, the direction of the struggle will deviate in various ways, and the revolutionary movement will experience reversals and twists and turns.

In such a profound revolutionary movement as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which touches people's souls, various ideologies of different classes will inevitably emerge and struggle tenaciously. To ensure the absolute leadership of Mao Zedong Thought and to ensure that the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is not interfered with, it is necessary to attach great importance to the various non-proletarian ideologies within the people and the revolutionary ranks, and to actively carry out ideological struggles. As Comrade Lin Biao has pointed out, we must use Mao Zedong Thought to unify our thoughts and take Mao Zedong Thought as the common ideological foundation for the unity and revolution of the people of the entire country.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao has always paid great attention to the ideological transformation of our revolutionary ranks. He requires us, while seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, to seize the power of the "self" in our minds. Recently, Chairman Mao has emphasized: It is necessary to skillfully guide the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks to the track of proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

If we deviate from the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought and the leadership of proletarian ideology and carry out the revolution according to petty-bourgeois ideology, it will be impossible to lead the revolution to victory. Historical experience has repeatedly proven this.

Our country was originally a country with an extremely broad petty-bourgeois composition, and petty-bourgeois ideology has a fairly wide influence. Not only do some old revolutionaries bear the imprint of petty-bourgeois ideology, but even the revolutionary youngsters who grew up under the red flag cannot avoid its influence. If we are not fully aware of this and do not draw a clear line between proletarian revolutionary nature and petty-bourgeois ideology, always thinking that we are very revolutionary and very correct, and do not seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works, while transforming the objective world, we also transform our subjective world, we will deviate from the track of proletarian revolution.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution to establish Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao has correctly solved a series of problems of contemporary proletarian revolution, solved the theoretical and practical problems of carrying out revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration, and developed Marxism-Leninism to a new stage—the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. Using great Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, and policies on carrying out revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, to arm our minds, overcome individualism, sectarianism, anarchism, and various non-proletarian ideologies, break with selfishness and establish public spirit, and transform our worldview, is the decisive factor for the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrade Lin Biao has always held high the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works. Comrade Lin Biao is Chairman Mao's best student and closest comrade-in-arms. He has the deepest understanding of Mao Zedong Thought, the most active promotion of Mao Zedong Thought, the most skillful creative application of Mao Zedong Thought, and the most courageous defense of Mao Zedong Thought. He has always followed Chairman Mao and has always been the most loyal, resolute, and thorough executor of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, setting a brilliant example for us. We must actively respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call: "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao," "Study with questions in mind, study and apply actively, study and apply in combination, learn urgently what is needed immediately, see results immediately, and work hard on the 'use' aspect." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, raise the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new level.

Our army is the people's army created and led by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao. All the victories of our army are the victories of Mao Zedong Thought. The experience of building our army has countless principles, but the most fundamental one is to do a good job of Mao Zedong Thought education. We must take Comrade Lin Biao as an example and follow Comrade Lin Biao's instructions to further grasp the study and application of Mao Zedong Thought and further study and implement the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Only in this way can we complete the glorious and arduous tasks of "supporting the left," "military assistance," and "military control," only in this way can we make the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of our army better, and only in this way can we establish new merits for defending the motherland and defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

We will always carry out the revolution according to Mao Zedong Thought, and we will always be victorious!

　　永远按照毛泽东思想干革命
　　——纪念中国共产党诞生四十六周年
    纪念“七一”，我们全体指战员从心底发出热烈的欢呼：
    伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席万岁！
    伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们党四十六年斗争的伟大实践反复证明，当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——伟大的毛泽东思想，是中国革命唯一正确的指针，是无产阶级最强大的思想武器。正如林彪同志所指出：中国革命胜利的原因很多，但主要的具有决定性的原因，就是我们有了毛泽东思想。
    我们党的历史，就是毛泽东思想的发展史，就是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线战胜各种“左”右倾机会主义路线的历史，就是毛泽东思想战胜各种资产阶级和小资产阶级思想的历史。
    在毛泽东思想指引下，第一次国内革命战争，第二次国内革命战争，都曾经获得伟大的胜利；但由于陈独秀、李立三、王明等右的和“左”的机会主义路线的错误领导，这两次革命战争终于遭受到失败和严重挫折。在革命的危急关头，是毛主席挽救了中国革命，转失败为胜利。遵义会议确立了毛主席在党中央的领导地位，从此，在伟大的毛泽东旗帜下，中国革命就从胜利走向胜利。但是，两条路线的斗争并没有停止。抗日战争初期，曾经出现过王明、彭德怀的投降主义路线。抗日战争胜利之后，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派公开鼓吹议会道路、放弃武装斗争的投降主义路线。伟大的毛泽东思想战胜了右倾机会主义的逆流，引导中国人民夺取了全国范围的胜利。
    全国胜利之后，十七年来，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，仍然一直顽固地推行一条资产阶级反动路线，妄图把我们党变成修正主义的党，在中国实行资本主义。如果这种阴谋得逞，我们伟大的祖国就要改变颜色，中国革命和世界革命就要出现一次大倒退。由于我们伟大舵手毛主席的英明领导，及时地粉碎了复辟资本主义的阴谋，就保证了中国革命的航船沿着社会主义共产主义的方向胜利前进。
    历史的结论就是这样：别的什么思想，什么路线，都不灵，只有马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想最灵，只有毛主席的无产阶级革命路线最灵。在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，不管有什么惊涛骇浪，不管有什么艰难险阻，革命都能够迅速前进，飞跃发展，取得一个又一个的伟大胜利。相反，离开了毛泽东思想，离开了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，即使客观形势很好，革命都要遭受挫折，都要失败。有毛主席的英明领导，是全党全国人民的最大幸福。我们一定要按照毛泽东思想干革命，而决不能用任何别的思想干革命。过去是这样，今天是这样，将来是这样，永远是这样。
    毛泽东思想集中体现了无产阶级和广大劳动人民的最高利益。要按照毛泽东思想干革命，要贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就必须克服革命队伍内部形形色色的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想的抗拒和干扰。
    毛主席历来极端重视革命队伍内部的思想斗争和思想教育。早在《关于纠正党内的错误思想》一文中，毛主席就指出：“红军第四军的共产党内存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，这对于执行党的正确路线，妨碍极大。若不彻底纠正，则中国伟大革命斗争给予红军第四军的任务，是必然担负不起来的。”在我党历史上具有伟大意义的整风运动期间，毛主席又教导我们：“我们要完成打倒敌人的任务，必须完成这个整顿党内作风的任务。……只要我们共产党的队伍是整齐的，步调是一致的，兵是精兵，武器是好武器，那末，任何强大的敌人都是能被我们打倒的。”在党的第七次代表大会上，毛主席又指出：“掌握思想教育，是团结全党进行伟大政治斗争的中心环节。如果这个任务不解决，党的一切政治任务是不能完成的。”
    无产阶级文化大革命是毛主席亲自发动和领导的史无前例的伟大革命运动。毛泽东思想是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大指南。任何部门，任何地方，无产阶级文化大革命一刻也不能离开毛泽东思想的指导。事实告诉我们，凡是坚决按照毛主席规定的路线、方针、政策办事，相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，严格区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，那里的革命就形势大好，那里的群众运动就轰轰烈烈，扎扎实实，健康地向前发展，就能够顺利地实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，为无产阶级夺好权、掌好权、用好权。相反，凡是资产阶级反动路线的影响没有很好肃清，凡是非无产阶级思想的干扰比较大，没有认真按照毛泽东思想办事的地方，那里斗争的大方向就会出现这样那样的偏差，革命运动就会出现反复和曲折。
    在无产阶级文化大革命这样一场触及人们灵魂的深刻的革命运动中，各个阶级的各种不同的思潮，不可避免地都要出来顽强地表现自己。要保证毛泽东思想的绝对领导，要保证毛泽东思想的指导不受干扰，就必须充分重视对人民内部和革命队伍中的各种非无产阶级思潮，开展积极的思想斗争。要象林彪同志所指出的那样：用毛泽东思想来统一我们的思想，把毛泽东思想作为全国人民团结和革命的共同思想基础。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席一直十分重视我们革命队伍的思想革命化。要求我们，在夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权的同时，要夺自己头脑里“私”字的权。最近，毛主席着重指出：必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。
    如果离开了毛泽东思想的领导，离开了无产阶级思想的领导，而按照小资产阶级思想干革命，决不可能把革命引向胜利。历史经验早已反复证明了这一点。
    我们的国家原来是一个小资产阶级成分极其广大的国家，小资产阶级思想有着相当广泛的影响。不仅有些老一代的革命者身上有着小资产阶级思想的烙印，就是在红旗下生长的革命小将，也不能不受到它的影响。如果我们在这方面没有充分的自觉，不划清无产阶级革命性和小资产阶级思想的界线，总以为自己是非常革命、非常正确，不认真去活学活用毛主席著作，在改造客观世界的同时改造自己的主观世界，那就会脱离无产阶级革命的轨道。
    无产阶级文化大革命是大立毛泽东思想的大革命。毛主席正确地解决了当代无产阶级革命的一系列的问题，解决了在无产阶级专政下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题，把马克思列宁主义发展到一个崭新的阶段——毛泽东思想的阶段。用伟大的毛泽东思想，用毛主席关于无产阶级专政下进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，来武装我们的头脑，克服个人主义、小团体主义、无政府主义，克服各种非无产阶级思想，破私立公，改造世界观，是无产阶级文化大革命取得彻底胜利的决定因素。
    林彪同志一贯高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作。林彪同志是毛主席最好的学生，最亲密的战友。他最深刻地领会毛泽东思想，最积极地宣传毛泽东思想，最善于创造性地应用毛泽东思想，最英勇地捍卫毛泽东思想。他一贯紧跟毛主席，一贯最忠实最坚决最彻底地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为我们树立了光辉的榜样。我们要积极响应林彪同志号召：“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”，“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫”。在无产阶级文化大革命中，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新阶段。
    我军是毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林彪同志直接指挥的人民军队。我军取得的一切胜利，都是毛泽东思想的胜利。我军建设的经验千条万条，搞好毛泽东思想教育是最根本的一条。我们一定要以林彪同志为榜样，按照林彪同志的指示，进一步抓紧活学活用毛泽东思想，进一步学习和贯彻以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。这样，才能胜利完成光荣而艰巨的“三支”“两军”任务，才能把我军的无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好，才能为保卫祖国、保卫无产阶级文化大革命建立新的功勋。
    我们永远按照毛泽东思想干革命，我们就永远胜利！
                                          （七月一日）
