The revolutionary masses of the Dalian Mining and Vehicle Factory, along with the broad revolutionary masses, have responded to Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production." In the midst of a high tide of criticism against the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, they have successfully developed China's first narrow-gauge railway hydraulic transmission diesel locomotive.

The locomotive, with a power of 240 horsepower, features advanced hydraulic-mechanical transmission and automatic gear-shifting equipment. It has excellent traction performance, high starting traction force, and is easy to operate. The running gear of the locomotive is designed with a bogie structure, providing good shock absorption. The locomotive runs smoothly even at high speeds. This new type of locomotive outperforms steam locomotives and mechanical transmission diesel locomotives. Using this type of locomotive on forest railways, mining railways, and local narrow-gauge railways will significantly reduce the investment in railway construction and maintenance costs compared to using steam locomotives with the same traction force.

The successful development of the hydraulic transmission diesel locomotive marks a significant leap in China's narrow-gauge railway locomotive manufacturing technology.

Recently, this narrow-gauge railway hydraulic transmission diesel locomotive underwent trial runs on a forest railway in Heilongjiang Province, which has complex lines, steep slopes, and many curves. After being evaluated by relevant departments, it was found that the locomotive's main technical performance fully met the design requirements.

    我国制成窄轨铁路液力传动内燃机车
    据新华社哈尔滨电　大连工矿车辆厂的无产阶级革命派同广大革命群众一起，响应毛主席提出的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，在对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派进行大批判的高潮中，试制成功了我国第一台窄轨铁路液力传动内燃机车。
    试制成功的这台功率为二百四十马力的窄轨铁路液力传动内燃机车，采用了先进的液力机械传动装置和自动换挡设备，牵引性能良好，起动牵引力大，操纵方便。机车走行部分为转向架结构，减震性能好；机车在高速运行时，比较平稳。这种新型机车的技术性能超过了蒸汽机车和机械传动内燃机车。森林铁路、矿山铁路和地方窄轨铁路采用这种机车，比采用同样牵引力的蒸汽机车将大大降低铁路建设的投资和线路的维修费用。
    液力传动内燃机车的试制成功，标志着我国窄轨铁路机车制造技术水平的一个飞跃。
    最近，这台窄轨铁路液力传动内燃机车，在黑龙江省一条线路复杂、坡度大、弯路多的森林铁路上试验运行，经有关部门鉴定，认为这台机车的主要技术性能完全达到了技术设计要求。
