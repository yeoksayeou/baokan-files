Currently, in many places and departments, the proletarian revolutionary factions are in a dominant position or have seized power. The new situation poses new and higher demands on the proletarian revolutionary factions. It requires us to use Mao Zedong Thought as our guide, to continuously carry out rectification, to summarize the experiences of the past year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to promote achievements, overcome shortcomings, transform our worldview, and raise our revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline. We must oppose bourgeois ideology and style, and strive for new victories in the decisive battle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, their ideological consciousness is bound to be reflected. They will definitely use various means to stubbornly express themselves in political and ideological issues. It is impossible for them not to reflect and express themselves."

Our country is a country with a large number of petty bourgeoisie. Petty bourgeois ideology belongs to the category of bourgeois ideology. In the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a large number of revolutionary intellectuals responded to Chairman Mao's call, threw themselves into the cultural revolution, were tempered, and played a vanguard and bridge role. However, it must be seen that their bourgeois worldview has not been thoroughly transformed. Many among them still have a bourgeois and petty bourgeois kingdom in the depths of their souls. We must pay attention to this reality, strengthen ideological transformation, and adapt to the needs of the current revolutionary situation.

In our ranks, the vast majority responded to Chairman Mao's great call, with class hatred towards the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and participated in the cultural revolution. However, it is undeniable that there are also many people who participated in the revolutionary ranks with various personal motives. Therefore, when they were suppressed by the bourgeois reactionary line, they would also rise up to resist and fight, and play a certain positive role in the struggle. However, after they themselves were liberated, they forgot the Marxist teaching that the proletariat can only liberate itself by liberating all of humanity, became complacent, stopped being revolutionary, and stopped moving forward.

The bourgeois and petty bourgeois ideology within the proletarian revolutionary ranks is a stumbling block to the revolution's progress, a serious obstacle to achieving great unity and the "three-in-one combination," and plays a role in weakening the proletarian dictatorship. If we do not face up to these problems and break with self-interest to serve the public, we will not be able to correctly implement the proletarian revolutionary line, and we may end up implementing the bourgeois reactionary line again. We may even become stumbling blocks to the revolution and become figures who bloom for a day and fade away.

The bourgeois and petty bourgeois ideology within the revolutionary ranks poses a great threat to the revolutionary cause. If the proletariat does not wage a resolute struggle against these erroneous tendencies, it is equivalent to indulging the petty bourgeoisie's disorderliness, vacillation, and inability to act in unison. Therefore, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the proletariat must mobilize the masses to overthrow the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road; on the other hand, it must also wage a resolute struggle against the bourgeois and petty bourgeois ideology within the revolutionary ranks, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform petty bourgeois ideology, let them educate themselves and liberate themselves, and gradually abandon the bourgeois worldview in the struggle, establishing a proletarian worldview.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Many of our comrades still do not clearly understand the difference between the proletariat and the petty bourgeoisie." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has developed to this day, and the situation requires us to clearly recognize the difference between proletarian revolutionaries and petty bourgeois revolutionaries; to recognize the difference between the proletariat's revolutionary consciousness and the petty bourgeoisie's spontaneous revolutionary nature. We must deeply understand Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, and policies of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and place the transformation of our bourgeois worldview in a more important position. Gradually become a conscious proletarian revolutionary fighter.

    反对资产阶级思想和作风
    北京航空学院　红旗战斗队
    目前，在许多地方和部门，无产阶级革命派已处于优势或掌权的地位。新的形势向无产阶级革命派提出了新的更高的要求。要求我们以毛泽东思想为指南，不断进行整风，总结一年来无产阶级文化大革命的经验，发扬成绩，克服缺点，改造世界观，提高革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，反对资产阶级思想和作风，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的决战中夺取新胜利。
    毛主席教导我们：“资产阶级、小资产阶级，他们的思想意识是一定要反映出来的。一定要在政治问题和思想问题上，用各种办法顽强地表现他们自己。要他们不反映不表现，是不可能的。”
    我国是一个小资产阶级人数众多的国家，而小资产阶级思想是属于资产阶级思想的范畴的。在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大的革命知识分子响应毛主席的号召，投身到文化大革命的洪流中去，受到了锻炼，起了先锋和桥梁的作用。但是，必须看到，他们的资产阶级世界观还没有得到彻底的改造，他们中间的许多人，灵魂深处还是一个资产阶级、小资产阶级的王国。我们必须重视这一现实，加强思想改造，适应当前革命形势发展的需要。
    在我们的队伍中，绝大多数是响应毛主席的伟大号召，带着对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的阶级仇恨参加文化大革命的。但是，无可讳言，也有许多人是带着形形色色的个人动机参加到革命队伍中来的。因此，当他们在受资产阶级反动路线压抑的时候，也会起来反抗、斗争，并在斗争中起到一定的积极作用。但是，当他们自己获得解放之后，就忘记了马克思主义关于无产阶级只有解放全人类，才能解放自己的教导，安于现状，不再革命，不再前进了。
    无产阶级革命派队伍中的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，是革命前进的绊脚石，是实现革命的大联合和“三结合”的严重障碍，起着削弱无产阶级专政的作用。我们如果不正视这些问题，破私立公，就不可能正确地执行无产阶级革命路线，就有可能重新执行资产阶级反动路线。甚至变成革命的绊脚石，成为昙花一现的人物。
    革命队伍中的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，对革命事业的危害极大。无产阶级如果不对这些错误倾向作坚决的斗争，就等于放纵小资产阶级的散漫、动摇、不能统一行动等劣根性。因此，在无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级要发动广大群众打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派；另一方面，又要向革命队伍中的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想进行坚决的斗争，用毛泽东思想改造小资产阶级思想，让他们自己教育自己，自己解放自己，在斗争中逐步抛弃资产阶级世界观，树立无产阶级世界观。
    毛主席指出：“我们有许多同志还不大清楚无产阶级和小资产阶级的区别。”无产阶级文化大革命发展到今天，形势要求我们必须认清无产阶级革命家与小资产阶级革命家的区别；认清无产阶级革命自觉性与小资产阶级革命自发性的区别。要深刻领会毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，把改造自己的资产阶级世界观放在更为重要的位置。使自己逐步成为一个自觉的无产阶级革命战士。
