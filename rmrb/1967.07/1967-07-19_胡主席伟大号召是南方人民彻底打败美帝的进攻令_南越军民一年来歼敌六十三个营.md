Chairman Ho's great call is the order for the people of South Vietnam to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors' invasion. In the past year, the military and civilian population of South Vietnam have annihilated 63 enemy battalions.

According to a report from the Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 17th, the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency reported that Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call to resist America and save the nation, issued last July 17, is the battle cry that has inspired the military and civilian population of South Vietnam to thoroughly defeat the American invaders. Over the past year, the military and civilian population have bravely fought the enemy and worked hard to produce, resolutely implementing Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call, and have achieved great victories on all fronts.

The heroic armed forces of South Vietnam have taken Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Call" as the trumpet call to lead all the military and civilian population to charge into battle, determined to defeat the American imperialist invaders!

Six days after Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Call" was issued—on the night of July 23 last year—the If Man military airfield in Quang Nam was bombed to smithereens by the liberation armed forces, with 70 aircraft destroyed and 150 American soldiers annihilated. In response to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call in the past year, the military and civilian population of the South have annihilated 63 American puppet and mercenary battalions.

Under the great call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh, the guerrilla forces in the enemy's rear have risen up to attack the enemy. They have tightened the encirclement of the Americans, cut off the enemy's No. 1, No. 20, No. 13, and No. 15 strategic highways, and continuously attacked the enemy's transport convoys, dealing heavy blows to the enemy. Many village guerrilla forces have become stronger and stronger. They have defeated the "sweeping" operations of entire American battalions.

In the winter-spring battles of 1966-1967, the military and civilian population of the South resolutely implemented Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to thoroughly defeat the American bandits, achieving extremely brilliant victories in defeating the American bandits. From last October to this April, over seven months, the military and civilian population of the South annihilated 175,000 American puppet soldiers, completely wiped out 49 enemy battalions, and annihilated nearly one-fifth of the enemy's main combat forces. Since May of this year, the military and civilian population of the South have continued to achieve brilliant victories. Preliminary reports indicate that since May, they have annihilated 9 enemy battalions, including 5 American battalions.

In the liberated areas, which cover four-fifths of the entire South, Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call has greatly inspired the fighting spirit and production enthusiasm of the broad masses of peasants. In a letter of determination written by the Executive Committee of the Vietnam South Liberation Peasants' Association on behalf of all the peasants of the South to Chairman Ho, they expressed their determination to fight to the end and make any sacrifice.

Under extremely fierce war conditions, the peasants of the South have overcome all difficulties caused by natural disasters and enemy attacks, ensuring the area of cultivation and increasing production. In some places, in addition to growing rice, they have also planted three crops of miscellaneous grains, and in some places, they have grown three crops of rice in one year. Provinces such as Tra Vinh, Soc Trang, and Long An have also increased the area of early rice cultivation. Many places have achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest in the late season of last year.

In this past year, the peasants of the South have enthusiastically paid the war tax, faster and better than in any previous year. Many provinces' peasants, within two months after Chairman Ho issued the "Call," paid the war tax that exceeded the 1966 pre-collection plan. Many peasants also voluntarily sold their surplus grain to revolutionary organizations.

In various guerrilla zones and enemy-occupied areas, Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Call" of last year has become a great force inspiring the broad masses of people to fight against the enemy. Chairman Ho's call to resist America and save the nation has also greatly promoted the struggle of workers in cities occupied by the enemy.

Now, the armed forces and all the people of South Vietnam are continuing to implement Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call to resist America and save the nation with actions to thoroughly defeat the American bandits. Some time ago, Nguyen Huu Tho, Chairman of the Central Committee of the South Vietnam National Liberation Front, wrote a letter to Chairman Ho on behalf of the people of the South, assuring him: "The military and civilian population of the South remember your sacred call and affectionate instructions, and are more determined to overcome all difficulties, fear no sacrifice, and die rather than be slaves. Nothing is more precious than independence and freedom. The military and civilian population of the South will strive forward and build more brilliant battle achievements."

    胡主席伟大号召是南方人民彻底打败美帝的进攻令
    南越军民一年来歼敌六十三个营
    据新华社河内十七日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，胡志明主席去年七月十七日发出的抗美救国的伟大号召，是鼓舞越南南方军民彻底打败美国侵略军的进攻令。一年来，南方军民英勇杀敌、努力生产，坚决实现胡志明主席的伟大号召，在各条战线都取得了巨大的胜利。
    英雄的越南南方解放武装力量把胡志明主席的《号召书》当作指挥全体军民冲锋杀敌的号角，决心战胜美帝国主义侵略者！
    胡主席的《号召书》发出后的第六天——去年七月二十三日夜间，广南的若曼美军机场就被解放武装力量打得稀巴烂，七十架飞机被击毁，一百五十名美军被消灭。在响应胡志明主席的伟大号召的一年中，南方军民共歼灭美伪军和帮凶军六十三个营。
    在胡志明主席的伟大号召下，在敌人后方的游击队也奋起进攻敌人。他们紧缩了各个歼美包围圈，切断了敌人的第一号、第二十号、第十三和第十五号战略公路，连续袭击敌人的运输车队，给敌人以沉重打击。许多乡的游击队越战越强。他们打败了整营美军的“扫荡”。
    在一九六六——一九六七年冬春季战斗中，南方军民坚决贯彻胡志明主席彻底战胜美国强盗的号召，取得了战胜美国强盗的极其辉煌的胜利。从去年十月到今年四月冬春季的七个月中，南方军民共消灭美伪军十七万五千名，全歼敌人四十九个营，消灭了敌人近五分之一的战斗主力部队。从今年五月以来，南方军民又接连取得了辉煌的胜利。据初步消息，五月以来，共歼灭敌人九个营，其中包括美军五个营。
    在占整个南方五分之四面积的解放区里，胡志明主席的伟大号召极大地鼓舞了广大农民战斗意志和生产热情。越南南方解放农民协会执行委员会代表南方全体农民写给胡主席的决心书中表示，坚决战斗到底，不惜一切牺牲。
    在极其激烈的战争环境中，南方农民克服了由于天灾敌祸造成的一切困难，保证了耕种面积，提高了产量。有些地方除种水稻外，还增种了三造杂粮，有些地方一年种三造水稻。茶荣、芹苴和永隆等省还增加了早稻的耕种面积。许多地方取得了去年晚造的空前丰收。
    在这一年中，南方农民踊跃缴纳抗战公粮，比过去任何一年都要快和好。许多省的农民，在胡主席发出《号召书》后的两个月内所缴纳的抗战公粮，超过了一九六六年的预收计划。许多农民还自愿把余粮卖给革命组织。
    在各游击区和敌占区里，胡志明主席去年的《号召书》成为鼓舞广大人民同敌人斗争的巨大力量。胡主席的抗美救国《号召书》，对被敌人占据的城市里工人的斗争也起了很大的促进作用。
    现在，越南南方解放武装力量和全体人民，正继续以彻底战胜美国强盗的战斗行动来实现胡志明主席的抗美救国伟大号召。越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会主席团主席阮友寿代表南方人民前些时候写信向胡主席保证：“南方军民铭记您的神圣号召和亲切嘱咐，更加决心克服一切困难，不怕牺牲，誓死不当奴隶，没有什么能比独立、自由更为宝贵。南方军民将努力前进，建立更多的辉煌战功。”
