The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a fierce struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. It is a major issue concerning whether our country will follow the socialist path or the capitalist path, and it is also a major issue concerning the fate and future of the world proletarian revolution. For such a major political struggle, every true revolutionary cannot but be concerned and actively participate.

After the Cultural Revolution began, I particularly liked to read big-character posters and leaflets. From these big-character posters and leaflets, one can learn the revolutionary spirit of rebellion from the Red Guards, learn how they use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to analyze problems and expose enemies. From these big-character posters and leaflets, one can also understand the trends of class struggle in society and improve one's analytical and critical abilities. However, in the early stages of the movement, some comrades were concerned about me, advising me to read fewer big-character posters and leaflets, fearing that I would not understand the situation, not be able to distinguish right from wrong, say the wrong things, and be caught by others. After the People's Liberation Army intervened in the local Cultural Revolution, the leadership organized the troops to go out and propagandize, and I requested to participate, but some comrades also advised me not to go, fearing that I would say the wrong things and have a bad influence.

Why did some comrades advise me to go out less, read fewer big-character posters, and participate in fewer propaganda activities? It was simply because I had some understanding of studying Chairman Mao's works in the past, and the Party had given me honors. They were afraid that I would say the wrong things, do the wrong things, and have a bad influence, afraid that I would "fall."

With this question in mind, I studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists should experience storms and see the world; this storm is the storm of the masses' struggle, and this world is the world of the masses' struggle." The current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an unprecedented storm and world of class struggle. This storm is a severe test for us, but it is also the best training. We must not, in order to preserve our honor, not care about or participate in this revolution, or avoid this storm. We must not "wear a raincoat" and mix in this storm. On the contrary, we should actively participate in the struggle, stand at the forefront of the movement, and bravely face this storm. To preserve one's honor, not daring to actively participate in the struggle, not standing up to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, is 100% selfish; in front of the masses deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line, not struggling to win them back to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, is 100% ruthless; not exposing, criticizing, and striking at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, is 100% loss of position! Such people are 100% not qualified as revolutionary fighters. If I have studied Chairman Mao's works well in the past and can continue to study and apply them well in the struggle, I will not make big mistakes. Even if I say a few wrong words, do a few wrong things, and make some mistakes, I will quickly correct them. In this way, I will not "fall." If I have not studied Chairman Mao's works well and do not study and apply them well in the struggle, I will definitely make mistakes, and it is right that I "fall." Even if I do not "fall" today, I will "fall" in the future class struggles. It is not possible to preserve. To defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and to respond to Chairman Mao's great call, I must resolutely support the revolutionary leftists and actively throw myself into the great storm of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to undergo tempering and testing.

I tried to find time to read big-character posters and leaflets to better understand the local and national struggles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. After reading, I would ask myself questions and use Mao Zedong Thought to analyze and understand, improving my ability to discern direction and right from wrong. At the same time, I actively supported the struggles of the revolutionary leftists, participated in their organized meetings and parades, and under the leadership of the army, I stood firmly and boldly expressed my support for all revolutionary actions of the revolutionary leftists. For a period of time, to repel the new counterattack of the bourgeois reactionary line, I went out with the propaganda team to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, propagate Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the policies and directives of the Party Central Committee. Some people with ulterior motives once provocatively asked me questions, trying to shut our mouths. On the spot, I told them: Our support for the revolutionary leftist organizations is completely correct. Anyone using any pretext to prevent us from propagating Mao Zedong Thought, preventing us from defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, preventing us from supporting the revolutionary leftists, is impossible! Where there are masses, we will propagate Mao Zedong Thought there. Where there are revolutionary leftists, we will go there to support them.

Personally participating in the fierce struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads has deepened my understanding of the great significance of the Cultural Revolution, the essence of the bourgeois reactionary line, and strengthened my belief in the great leader Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The consciousness of class and class struggle, the consciousness of power, and the consciousness of line have taken deeper root in my mind. At the same time, I have also learned the revolutionary spirit of rebellion and fighting experience from the revolutionary youngsters.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "To study Marxism, one must not only learn from books, but mainly through class struggle, practical work, and getting close to the workers and peasants, can one truly learn." The struggle practice of the past year has made me deeply feel that the scene of the fierce struggle between the two classes and two lines is the best classroom for us to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. As long as you enter this classroom, various events, various trends, various viewpoints, and various people's questions to you, all force you to take a stand, force you to use Mao Zedong Thought to answer. This is the best school for studying and applying Mao Zedong Thought, and the best classroom for living class education. In this classroom, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works with questions is the most realistic, the most vivid, the most profound, the most able to touch the soul, the most able to test the learning effect, and the learning gains are the greatest. Only by learning in this classroom can one truly raise the level of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage. Every comrade who has some understanding of studying Chairman Mao's works in the past should not "live on past merits," should not be afraid of this and that to preserve honors, but should remove the "fear" and replace it with "dare," personally participate in the fierce struggle practice between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, become the most active fighters to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and raise the level of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle.

    文化革命是活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂
    王道明
    无产阶级文化大革命，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争。它是关系到我们的国家走社会主义道路，还是走资本主义道路的大问题，也是关系到无产阶级世界革命的命运和前途的大问题。对于这样一场重大的政治斗争，每一个真正的革命者，是不能不关心，不能不积极参加的。
    文化大革命开始以后，我特别喜欢看大字报和传单。从这些大字报和传单里，可以学习红卫兵小将的革命造反精神，学习他们如何用毛泽东思想作武器，分析问题，揭露敌人。从这些大字报和传单里，也可以了解社会阶级斗争的动向，提高自己的分析批判能力。可是在运动初期，有的同志却替我担心，劝我少看大字报和传单，怕我不了解情况，分辨不清是非，说错了话，被人家抓住。在解放军介入地方文化大革命以后，领导上组织部队上街宣传，我要求参加，有的同志也建议我不去，怕我说错了话，影响不好。
    为什么有的同志让我少上街，少看大字报，少参加一些宣传活动呢？不是别的，就是因为我过去学习毛主席著作有点体会，党给了我荣誉。他们怕我说错了话，做错了事，影响不好，怕我“倒”了。
    我带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们说：“我们共产党员应该经风雨，见世面；这个风雨，就是群众斗争的大风雨，这个世面，就是群众斗争的大世面。”当前的无产阶级文化大革命，是史无前例的阶级斗争的大风雨大世面，这场大风雨是对我们的严峻考验，也是最好的锻炼。绝对不能为了保住自己的荣誉，就不关心、不参加这场革命，或躲避这场大风雨。更不能在这场大风雨中“穿着雨衣”混。相反，应该积极参加斗争，站在运动的前面，迎着这场大风雨往前闯。为了保住自己的荣誉，不敢积极参加斗争，不站出来保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，是百分之百的私心；在受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的群众面前，不争取他们回到毛主席的革命路线一边来，是百分之百的无情；对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派不揭露、不批判、不打击，是百分之百的丧失立场！这种人，是百分之百的不够一个革命战士。如果说我过去学毛主席著作学得比较好，在参加斗争中又能继续学好，用好，我就不会犯很大的错误。即使说了几句错话，办了几件错事，犯了一些错误，也会很快地改正。这样我就不会“倒”。如果我没有学好毛主席著作，在斗争中又不很好地学，很好地用，就一定会犯错误，“倒”了也是应该的。就是今天不“倒”，在以后的阶级斗争中也要“倒”。保是保不住的。为了保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为了响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚决支持革命左派，我要积极地投身到无产阶级文化大革命的大风雨里去，经受锻炼，经受考验。
    我尽量挤出时间看大字报和传单，更多地了解当地的和全国的无产阶级文化大革命的斗争情况。看了以后，就给自己提出问题，用毛泽东思想去分析，去认识，提高自己辨别方向、辨别是非的能力。同时，我还积极支持革命左派的斗争，参加他们组织的集会、游行，在部队领导的支持下，旗帜鲜明，立场坚定，大胆表态，坚决支持革命左派的一切革命行动。有一段时间，为了打退资产阶级反动路线的新反扑，我随宣传队上街宣传毛泽东思想，宣传毛主席的革命路线和党中央的方针、政策。有些别有用心的人曾经挑衅性地向我提出问题，想堵住我们的嘴。当场我就告诉他们：我们对革命左派组织的支持是完全正确的，任何人用任何借口不让我们宣传毛泽东思想，不让我们捍卫毛主席的革命路线，不让我们支持革命左派，都是办不到的！那里有群众，我们就在那里宣传毛泽东思想，那里有革命左派，我们就到那里去支持。
    亲身投入到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈的斗争中，使我对文化大革命的伟大意义，对资产阶级反动路线的本质，认识更加深刻了。对伟大领袖毛主席，对毛泽东思想，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的英明正确，更加坚信了。阶级和阶级斗争观念，政权观念，路线观念，在脑子里更扎根了。同时，也向革命小将们学习了革命造反精神和斗争经验。
    毛主席教导我们说：“学习马克思主义，不但要从书本上学，主要地还要通过阶级斗争、工作实践和接近工农群众，才能真正学到。”一年来的斗争实践，使我深深地体会到：两个阶级、两条路线激烈斗争的现场，是我们活学活用毛主席著作最好的课堂。只要你一进入这个课堂，各种事件，各种思潮，各种观点，各种人向你提出的问题，都逼着你表态，逼着你用毛泽东思想去回答。这是活学活用毛泽东思想的大学校，活的阶级教育的课堂。在这个课堂里，带着问题活学活用毛主席著作，最现实，最生动，最深刻，最能够触及灵魂，最能够检验学习效果，学习的收获也最大。只有在这个课堂里学，才能够真正把活学活用毛主席著作提高到一个新阶段。每一个过去学习毛主席著作有些体会的同志，都不应该“吃老本”，不应该为保荣誉而怕这怕那，而应该去掉“怕”字，换上“敢”字，亲身投入到两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争的实践中去，做保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线最积极的战士，在斗争中把活学活用毛主席著作的水平提高一步。
