The top capitalist-roaders within the party have betrayed proletarian dictatorship, and thus they cannot help but betray the proletarian dictatorship's command center—the Communist Party. In his book *Self-Cultivation*, he proposes a whole set of revisionist party-building guidelines, which is ironclad proof of his betrayal of proletarian dictatorship.

Chairman Mao says: "Why is there a need for a revolutionary party? Because there are enemies oppressing the people in the world, and the people want to overthrow the enemy's oppression, so there must be a revolutionary party. In the era of capitalism and imperialism, a revolutionary party like the Communist Party is needed. If there were no such revolutionary party as the Communist Party, it would be impossible for the people to overthrow the enemy's oppression." This makes us deeply understand that the Communist Party is the core leadership force of proletarian dictatorship, the command center of proletarian dictatorship. Chairman Mao has always regarded party building as the main magic weapon for leading the Chinese revolution, and pointed out that strengthening party building is the need of the proletarian revolution and proletarian dictatorship. Chairman Mao's party-building thoughts are completely opposed to the revisionist party-building guidelines of the author of *Self-Cultivation*. Chairman Mao insists on building the Communist Party according to the needs of proletarian dictatorship, while the author of *Self-Cultivation* attempts to destroy the Communist Party according to the needs of bourgeois restoration.

Chairman Mao says: "The Communist Party must expand its organization, open its doors to the broad masses of workers, peasants, and youth who are truly revolutionary, believe in the party's ideology, support the party's policies, and are willing to obey discipline and work hard, making the party a great mass party." The author of *Self-Cultivation*, however, openly welcomes those with "various colors and different purposes and motives," including those who "join the Communist Party to find a way out," "to be able to 'get along' in the future," and those brought in by relatives and friends. Not only does he write this way, but he also acts this way. Hasn't he advocated that "capitalists can join the party" and develop so-called "rich peasant party members"? Hasn't he stuffed a large number of traitors, who have betrayed under his instructions, into the key departments of the party? Where is this the "organizational line" of the Communist Party? This is a thorough and complete gangster-like affair of surrender and corruption!

Chairman Mao has always believed that intra-party struggle is a reflection of class struggle within the party. Chairman Mao points out: "If there are no contradictions and struggles to resolve contradictions within the party, the party's life will also stop." However, the author of *Self-Cultivation* claims that intra-party struggle is caused by "different methods of looking at problems" among party members, leading to "disagreements, different views, and disputes." Here, the struggle between proletarian thought and bourgeois thought is gone, the struggle between the socialist road and the capitalist road is gone, and the struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line and the bourgeois reactionary line is gone, completely erasing the Marxist principle that intra-party struggle is a reflection of class struggle.

At the same time, the author of *Self-Cultivation* maliciously slanders normal intra-party ideological struggles as "deliberately searching for 'struggle targets' within the party, deliberately creating intra-party struggles, and abusing organizational means, even means of struggle outside the party, to punish comrades." Particularly malicious is his attack on our great leader Chairman Mao, and our party's struggle against right-opportunism, accusing it of "committing unforgivable errors." This is intolerable!

It is clear that the "party" that the Chinese Khrushchev dreams of is the "party of the whole people" of Soviet Khrushchev. He is attempting to use the revisionist party-building guidelines to transform our party, trying to change our proletarian dictatorship's command center—the Communist Party—into the command center of bourgeois counter-revolutionary restoration—a revisionist party. How evil his intentions are!

However, we have the great leader Chairman Mao, we have the great Mao Zedong Thought. We must use Chairman Mao's party-building thoughts as a weapon to thoroughly criticize the reactionary essence of the revisionist party-building guidelines of the top capitalist-roader within the party, defend the proletarian command center, and never allow the ambitions of Khrushchev-like schemers to succeed!

    休想把共产党变为修正主义的党
    党支部书记、指导员　丁先明
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派背叛无产阶级专政，就不能不背叛无产阶级专政的司令部——共产党。他在《修养》里提出一整套修正主义的建党纲领，便是背叛无产阶级专政的铁证。
    毛主席说：“为什么要有革命党？因为世界上有压迫人民的敌人存在，人民要推翻敌人的压迫，所以要有革命党。就资本主义和帝国主义时代说来，就需要一个如共产党这样的革命党。如果没有共产党这样的革命党，人民要想推翻敌人的压迫，简直是不可能的。”这使我们深刻认识到，共产党是无产阶级专政的核心领导力量，是无产阶级专政的司令部。毛主席历来把党的建设作为领导中国革命的主要法宝，并指出，加强党的建设，是无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的需要。毛主席的建党思想，完全同《修养》作者的修正主义建党纲领针锋相对。毛主席坚持按无产阶级专政的需要建设共产党，《修养》作者妄图按资产阶级复辟的需要搞垮共产党。
    毛主席说：“共产党必须扩大自己的组织，向着真诚革命、信仰党的主义、拥护党的政策、并愿意服从纪律、努力工作的广大工人农民和青年积极分子开门，使党成为一个伟大的群众性的党。”《修养》作者却公开表示“欢迎”“带着各种各色不同的目的和动机”，包括那些“到共产党里来找出路”、“为了将来能够‘吃得开’，以及被亲戚朋友带进来”的人加入共产党。他不但这样写，而且也是这样做的。他不是宣扬“资本家也可以入党”，要发展所谓“富农党员”吗？他不是把一大批在他指使下变节的叛徒塞进党的要害部门吗？这哪里是什么共产党的“组织路线”，这是彻头彻尾的招降纳叛、藏污纳垢的帮会勾当！
    毛主席历来认为，党内斗争是阶级斗争在党内的反映。毛主席指出：“党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”可是《修养》作者偏偏把党内斗争说成是“因为各种党员看问题的方法不同”而引起的“不同意见、不同主张的分歧和争论”。在这里，无产阶级思想同资产阶级思想的斗争不见了，社会主义道路同资本主义道路的斗争不见了，无产阶级革命路线同资产阶级反动路线的斗争不见了，完全抹煞了党内斗争是阶级斗争的反映这一马克思主义原理。
    与此同时，《修养》作者还肆意污蔑党内正常的思想斗争是“故意在党内搜索‘斗争对象’，故意制造党内斗争，并且滥用组织手段甚至党外斗争的手段来惩罚同志”。尤其恶毒的是，他竟以反对“左”倾机会主义为名，含沙射影地攻击我们伟大领袖毛主席，攻击我们党对于右倾机会主义的斗争“犯了不可饶恕的错误”。是可忍，孰不可忍！
    很明显，中国赫鲁晓夫的理想的“党”，正是苏联赫鲁晓夫的“全民党”。他就是企图利用修正主义的建党纲领来改造我们党，妄图把我们无产阶级专政的司令部——共产党，篡改为资产阶级反革命复辟的司令部——修正主义的党。用心何其恶毒！
    但是，我们有伟大的领袖毛主席，我们有伟大的毛泽东思想，我们一定要用毛主席的建党思想作武器，彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的修正主义建党纲领的反动本质，捍卫无产阶级的司令部，绝不让赫鲁晓夫那样的野心家篡党阴谋得逞！
