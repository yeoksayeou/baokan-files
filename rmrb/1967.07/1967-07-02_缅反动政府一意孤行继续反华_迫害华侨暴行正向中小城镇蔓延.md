The reactionary government of Burma is continuing to defy China and persecute overseas Chinese, with fascist atrocities spreading to medium and small towns in Burma.

According to a report from the New China News Agency on July 1, the fascist atrocities against Chinese people in Burma, instigated by the reactionary government, are spreading to some medium and small towns in Burma.

According to reports, on the evening of June 29, more than 2,000 rioters gathered in Magwe, a town in central Burma, and ransacked about 20 Chinese shops and residences.

According to the Burmese newspaper "The Guardian," in Mandalay, about 300 miles from Rangoon, approximately 1,000 rioters engaged in rampant anti-Chinese activities on the morning of June 30, shouting anti-Chinese slogans in the streets. The newspaper also reported that in Bassein, about 300 rioters held anti-Chinese activities. According to the Burmese newspaper "The People's Daily," in Yenangyaung, some rioters on June 29 moved around in groups, and about 100 of them smashed a Chinese-run tea house on the main street with stones in the afternoon.

Another report from a Western news agency in Rangoon stated that on June 27, "almost all Chinese shops and many Chinese residences were systematically destroyed." "Rangoon looked like a city that had been bombed, with burned-out cars lying haphazardly, and burned and charred Chinese belongings piled on the roads. Broken glass and smashed jars covered the entire sidewalk."

Some reports said, "Groups of 100 to 200 Burmese people roamed the city, smashing Chinese shops, restaurants, cinemas, beauty salons, and photo studios." "It seems that not a single Chinese residence or shop escaped destruction." Meanwhile, some reports revealed touching examples of Burmese people risking their lives to protect Chinese people during the days when rioters looted Rangoon's Chinese community. Some reports said, "Many Burmese people were seen helping them (Chinese) clean up the damaged residences and shops." The report said, "Some Burmese people were also injured when they tried to protect their Chinese friends."

　　缅反动政府一意孤行继续反华
    迫害华侨暴行正向中小城镇蔓延
    据新华社一日讯　仰光消息：缅甸反动政府一手制造的反华排华法西斯暴行，正在向缅甸的一些中、小城镇蔓延。
    据报道，缅甸中部的马圭镇，六月二十九日晚上有两千多暴徒纠集在一起，捣毁了华侨商店和住所约二十处。
    据缅甸《卫报》报道，在远离仰光三百多英里的曼德勒市，六月三十日上午大约有一千多名暴徒进行猖狂反华活动，沿街狂呼反华口号。这家报纸还报道，在贝塞因大约有三百个暴徒举行反华活动。据缅甸《劳动人民日报》报道，在仁安羌，一些暴徒六月二十九日四处出动，其中的一百人在当天下午用石块砸了设在主要街道上的一家华侨经营的茶庄。
    另西方通讯社发自仰光的报道，在二十七日发生的反华暴行中，“几乎所有中国的店铺和许多中国的住宅成系统地被破坏了。”“仰光看起来象一个被炸弹炸过的城市，被烧的汽车乱七八糟地躺着，被烧毁的、烧得焦黑的中国人的财物堆在路上。打碎的玻璃和打烂的坛坛罐罐盖满了整个人行道。”
    有的报道说：“一百到二百成批的缅甸人在这个城市游荡，打砸中国人的店铺、饭馆、电影院、美容院和照相馆。”“看来，在被砸坏中国人的住宅和商店时，没有一家幸免于遭到破坏。”同时，一些报道透露了缅甸人民在暴徒们洗劫仰光华侨的几天中，冒着生命危险，保护华侨的动人事例。有的报道说：“人们看到许多缅甸人帮助他们（华侨）收拾被砸坏的住宅和店铺。”报道说：“有一些缅甸人试图保护中国朋友时，也被打伤了。”
