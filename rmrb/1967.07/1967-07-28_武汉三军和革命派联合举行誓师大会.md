Raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher, and swiftly launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism

Wuhan's three military branches and revolutionary factions jointly hold a swearing-in rally

In a telegram to Chairman Mao, it was stated that the proletarian revolutionary factions in the Wuhan region, under your warm care and nurturing, have even more ardent fighting spirit and have further consolidated, developed, and grown stronger. Conservative forces are crumbling, and the deceived masses are quickly awakening. The Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and military in the Wuhan region have completely fallen into the vast sea of "people's war." The situation of the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan is excellent and getting better!

New China News Agency, Wuhan, July 27th — The great power of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is shaking the three cities of Wuhan. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and military in the Wuhan region have fallen into the vast sea of "people's war." Today, the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Wuhan, along with the revolutionary factions of military academies and the revolutionary fighters of the proletarian revolutionary factions in the Wuhan region, jointly held a swearing-in rally. They are determined to launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism on an even larger scale.

The cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary fighters of the proletarian revolutionary factions, with hearts full of indignation, denounced and condemned the heinous crimes committed by the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and military in the Wuhan region. They resolutely declared: We must raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, swiftly launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, resolutely overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev, resolutely overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and military, resolutely overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and military in the Wuhan region, and resolutely overthrow the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

The rally venue was adorned with red flags, and the shouts of slogans echoed through the sky. The revolutionary pioneers, who are fighting stronger and braver with each passing day, were all spirited and full of fighting spirit. The slogans "Overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders who have infiltrated the Party and military!" "Defend Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, Vice Chairman Lin, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group with our blood and lives!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" shook the revolutionary city of Wuhan with its glorious history of struggle. The revolutionary pioneers, with their great practice, showed the proletarian revolutionary factions across the country: They have not let down the great expectations of the great leader Chairman Mao, and they have not let down the support of the proletarian revolutionary factions across the country. They have united even more closely to fight! They are advancing victoriously!

At the rally venue, the cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary fighters of the proletarian revolutionary factions repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's quotations: "The enemy will not disappear on its own. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the invading forces of American imperialism in China, they will not retreat from the historical stage on their own." "The people rely on us to organize. The reactionaries in China rely on us to organize the people to overthrow them. Anything that is reactionary, if you don't fight it, it won't fall. This is also like sweeping the floor; if the broom doesn't reach, the dust won't run away on its own."

Amidst thunderous applause, the rally passed a telegram of respect to our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, expressing the revolutionary pioneers' determination and confidence to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end. The telegram said: Our most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao, at present, the broad proletarian revolutionary factions in the Wuhan region, under your warm care and nurturing, under the strong leadership and support of the Party Central Committee and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and under the powerful support of the proletarian revolutionary factions across the country, have even more ardent fighting spirit and even more vigorous morale, and have surged up a magnificent revolutionary tide. The revolutionary leftist forces that have emerged from the fierce struggle have further consolidated, developed, and grown stronger; conservative forces are crumbling, and the deceived masses are quickly awakening. The Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and military in the Wuhan region have completely fallen into the vast sea of "people's war." The situation of the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan is excellent and getting better! Beloved Chairman Mao, we swear to you: We will forever read your books, listen to your words, and act according to your instructions. We will be your good soldiers. We will definitely care about the affairs of the state and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end! Let the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high in the Wuhan region, in all of China, and in the world, forever!

After the rally, the cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and the proletarian revolutionary factions participated in a grand demonstration march in the rain.
