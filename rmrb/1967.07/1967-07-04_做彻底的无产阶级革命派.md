The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is developing more broadly and deeply. After a year of arduous and tortuous struggle, proletarian revolutionaries have gradually gained the upper hand politically and organizationally. In many places and units where power needs to be seized, proletarian revolutionaries have already taken power. With the change in their status, proletarian revolutionaries are facing new and severe tests.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists are not seeking official posts, but are seeking revolution. We must have a thorough spirit of revolution. We must not for a moment divorce ourselves from the masses. As long as we do not divorce ourselves from the masses, we shall certainly be victorious."

Broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries, following Chairman Mao's teachings, after taking power, adhere to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly grasp the general direction of the struggle. They are becoming politically mature in the practice of mass struggle. Their actions, their struggles, and their growth show that they have great hope, that they can advance with Chairman Mao in the midst of storms and waves, truly become good students of Chairman Mao, and become thorough proletarian revolutionaries.

Among the ranks of proletarian revolutionaries, there are also some comrades with serious petty-bourgeois ideas. When they are suppressed by the bourgeois reactionary line, they can fight alongside the proletariat against the bourgeois reactionary line and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, even playing important roles. However, it must be seen that the petty-bourgeois ideas and actions of these comrades are essentially different from proletarian revolutionary nature. They often easily turn to extreme fanaticism and blind spontaneity. This weakness often becomes prominent, especially after they take power.

Chairman Mao said: "The bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, their ideology will definitely be reflected. They will definitely use various means to stubbornly express themselves in political and ideological issues. To make them not reflect and not express themselves is impossible." It is not strange that various erroneous ideas and styles appear in the movement. The question is, what attitude do we take towards the ideology and style of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie: is it to resolutely resist and resolutely oppose, or to ignore and let them spread? This is a serious struggle between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview, a major issue concerning where the proletarian revolutionaries go after taking power.

In "The Central Committee to the Communist League," Marx and Engels pointed out: "The attitude of the revolutionary workers' party to the petty-bourgeois democrats is this: to go together with the petty-bourgeois democrats against the parties which the workers' party wants to overthrow; to oppose them when the petty-bourgeois democrats want to consolidate their position and seek private interests." Today, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we still need to deeply understand this important thought of Marx and Engels.

People with serious petty-bourgeois ideas, when they are not in power, the harm of their ideological flaws to the revolutionary cause is relatively small. When they take power, it is different. If they insist on using their petty-bourgeois methods to transform the world, it will be impossible to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and it is possible to execute the bourgeois reactionary line, repeating the historical mistakes.

It should be pointed out that in every great revolutionary movement led by the proletariat, there will inevitably be various kinds of fellow travelers to participate. As Lenin pointed out: in the proletarian party, "in the period of the bourgeois revolution, it is inevitable that more or less various kinds of 'fellow travelers' of different colors are absorbed... because the proletariat is constantly in contact with various strata of the petty bourgeoisie, constantly drawing strength from these strata." The situation in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is the same.

In our great socialist country, under the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought, these people, after joining the proletarian revolutionary ranks, as long as they can seriously study Chairman Mao's works in the struggle and highly value the transformation of their worldview, can completely be tempered into proletarian revolutionary fighters. However, if they neglect the transformation of their thoughts, are afraid to touch their souls, and do not dare to carry out the fierce conflict and struggle between collectivism, communism, and individualism, then they will gradually weaken and lose their revolutionary nature, will not be able to withstand the severe test of class struggle, and may leave the ranks of the proletarian revolutionaries who are advancing without fear, becoming transient figures on the historical stage.

In the history of our party, there have been such people. In the period of the democratic revolution, they could still partially agree with the party's minimum program, but they never intended to carry the proletarian revolution to the end. Because their bourgeois worldview was not transformed in the revolutionary struggle, they often clashed with the party. When the revolution entered the socialist period and the bourgeoisie and its ideology became the main target of the revolution, their contradictions with the party and the socialist revolution became increasingly sharp, and some eventually degenerated into right-opportunists discarded by history. Chairman Mao once sharply pointed out that these people were never Marxists-Leninists, but only fellow travelers of the party.

Today, every comrade of the proletarian revolutionaries should learn from this, take it as a warning.

Chairman Mao teaches us: we must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideas in our ranks to the track of proletarian revolution, which is a key issue for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to achieve victory. We must use Mao Zedong Thought, use the spirit of proletarian revolution to guide. If guided well, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will be victorious; if guided poorly, or not guided at all, we may still fail. If the proletarian revolutionaries in any unit that have taken power do not have a full awareness of this issue, the movement in that unit may suffer setbacks and recurrences.

Guiding petty-bourgeois ideas to the track of proletarian revolution is essentially a problem of thoroughly transforming the worldview. Chairman Mao said: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation," "the thorough transformation of worldview requires a long time." Completing this transformation is not an easy task. It is ten times, a hundred times more arduous than seizing power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. Our comrades must go through a long-term struggle and painful tempering process to become politically mature and truly grow into proletarian revolutionaries. They must constantly arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, while transforming the objective world, they must also work hard on transforming their subjective world, and carry out one battle after another to break down "private" and establish "public" in the depths of their souls. As awakened proletarians, as revolutionary fighters shouldering the heavy responsibility of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution, we should consciously and strictly demand ourselves to be thorough proletarian revolutionaries, and not be transient figures on the historical stage.

　　做彻底的无产阶级革命派
　　任立新
    无产阶级文化大革命正在更加广泛而深入地向前发展。经过一年来艰苦曲折的斗争，无产阶级革命派逐渐在政治上和组织上占了优势。在不少需要夺权的地方和单位，无产阶级革命派已经掌了权。无产阶级革命派随着地位的改变，面临着新的严峻的考验。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。只要我们不脱离群众，我们就一定会胜利。”
    广大的无产阶级革命派，遵循着毛主席的教导，在掌权以后，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，紧紧地掌握斗争的大方向。他们在群众斗争的实践中，正在政治上逐步成熟起来。他们的行动，他们的斗争，他们的成长，表明了他们很有希望，表明了他们能够在大风大浪中跟着毛主席前进，真正做一个毛主席的好学生，做一个彻底的无产阶级革命派。
    在无产阶级革命派队伍中，也有一些小资产阶级思想严重的同志，他们在受到资产阶级反动路线压制时，也能和无产阶级一道，跟资产阶级反动路线斗争，跟党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗争，甚至起过重要的作用。但是，应该看到，这些同志身上的小资产阶级思想和行动，在本质上和无产阶级革命性是不同的。他们常常容易转向极端的狂热性和盲目的自发性。这种弱点，在革命发展的转折关头，特别是在他们掌权以后，往往会突出地暴露出来。
    毛主席说：“资产阶级，小资产阶级，他们的思想意识是一定要反映出来的。一定要在政治问题和思想问题上，用各种办法顽强地表现他们自己。要他们不反映不表现，是不可能的。”在运动中出现这样那样的错误思想和作风，是不奇怪的。问题在于，我们对资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想和作风采取什么态度：是坚决抵制、坚决反对，还是熟视无睹，任其泛滥呢？这是无产阶级世界观同资产阶级世界观的严重斗争，是关系到无产阶级革命派掌权后向何处去的重大问题。
    马克思和恩格斯在《中央委员会告共产主义者同盟书》一文中指出：“革命的工人政党对于小资产阶级民主派的态度是这样的：同小资产阶级民主派一起去反对工人政党所要推翻的派别；小资产阶级民主派想要巩固本身地位来谋私利的时候，就要加以反对。”今天，在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们仍然有必要深刻领会马克思和恩格斯的这个重要思想。
    小资产阶级思想严重的人，在不当权时，他们思想上的毛病对革命事业的损害还小一些。当他们掌权后，就不同了。如果坚持用他们小资产阶级的一套去改造世界，就不可能把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，就有可能执行资产阶级反动路线，重蹈历史的覆辙。
    应该指出，在无产阶级领导的每一个伟大的革命运动当中，总会有各式各样的同路人来参加的。正如列宁所指出的：无产阶级政党中，“实际上在资产阶级革命时期都不可避免地或多或少吸收一些各种色彩的‘同路人’……因为无产阶级经常同小资产阶级的各式各样的阶层接触，经常不断地从这些阶层中吸取力量。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，情况也是这样。
    在我们伟大的社会主义国家里，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，这些人，在参加到无产阶级革命队伍里之后，只要能够在斗争中认真学习毛主席著作，高度地重视自己世界观的改造，是完全可以锻炼成为无产阶级革命战士的。但是，如果他们忽视自己思想的改造，害怕触及自己的灵魂，不敢于开展集体主义、共产主义同个人主义这样剧烈的冲突和斗争，那么，他们就会一天天减弱和丧失自己的革命性，就不可能经受阶级斗争的严峻的考验，就有可能离开一往无前的无产阶级革命派的队伍，成为历史舞台上匆匆来去的过客。
    在我们党的历史上，就曾经有过这样一些人。他们在民主革命时期，还能够勉强地部分地同意党的最低纲领，但是，他们从来也不打算把无产阶级革命进行到底。由于在革命斗争中他们的资产阶级世界观没有得到改造，他们常常和党发生抵触。当革命进入社会主义时期，资产阶级及其意识形态成为革命的主要对象时，他们和党、和社会主义革命的矛盾，就越来越尖锐，有些人最后堕落成为被历史抛弃的右倾机会主义分子。对于这样的人，毛主席曾经尖锐地指出，他们从来不是马克思列宁主义者，只不过是党的同路人。
    今天，每一个无产阶级革命派的同志，都应当从这里吸取教训，引以为戒。
    毛主席教导我们：必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。我们必须用毛泽东思想，必须用无产阶级革命精神来引导。引导得好，无产阶级文化大革命就会胜利；引导得不好，甚至不去引导，我们还可能失败。哪一个单位掌权的无产阶级革命派，如果对这个问题没有充分的自觉，这个单位的运动，就可能遭受挫折，出现反复。
    把小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，实质上是一个彻底改造世界观的问题。毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”，“世界观的彻底改变需要一个很长的时间”。完成这个转变，是一件不容易的事情。它比从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺权更加艰巨十倍、百倍。我们的同志要在政治上成熟起来，真正成长为一个无产阶级的革命家，还必须经过一个长期斗争、痛苦磨炼的过程；不断地用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，在改造客观世界的同时，还要在改造自己的主观世界上狠下功夫，在自己灵魂深处进行一场又一场破“私”立“公”的攻坚战。作为觉悟了的无产阶级，作为肩负着中国革命和世界革命重任的革命战士，我们都应当自觉地、严格地以彻底的无产阶级革命派来要求自己，而不要做历史舞台上昙花一现的人物。
