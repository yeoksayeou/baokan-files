Chairman Mao says: The just struggles of the people of all countries in the world are mutually supportive. The people of the world stand together with American blacks and fight together.

	According to a report compiled by our newspaper, the heroic struggle of American blacks against violence has received enthusiastic support and cheers from the revolutionary people of the world.

	The Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement on the 27th, expressing full support for the just struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination and for freedom and equal rights.

	The statement strongly condemns the savage racial discrimination system of the U.S. government and its bloody suppression of American blacks and whites who are fighting to defend freedom, democracy, and civil rights. The statement says that the people of South Vietnam and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam regard the struggle of American blacks as a great contribution to the struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism and the patriotic war of the people of South Vietnam.

	The statement concludes by saying that as long as they are closely united and continue the fight, the struggle of American blacks will surely achieve glorious victory.

	On the evening of the 27th, representatives of various circles in Hanoi held a rally to strongly support the just struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination and oppression.

	Le Thi Dinh, Vice-Chairman of the Vietnam Peace Committee, said in her speech at the meeting that the struggle of American blacks is an inseparable part of the national liberation movement and the struggle of the people of the world against imperialism led by U.S. imperialism and neo-colonialism, old and new, for national independence, democracy, peace, and social progress. She said that the struggle of American blacks against racial discrimination and the struggle of the American people against the U.S. imperialist war of aggression in Vietnam are continuously weakening the strength of U.S. imperialism, which is also a practical support for the cause of the Vietnamese people's resistance against U.S. aggression and national salvation.

	The meeting unanimously passed a resolution, enthusiastically hailing the heroic struggle of American blacks against the savage repression, persecution, and racial discrimination of the U.S. authorities.

	The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published a short commentary on the 27th, enthusiastically hailing the new developments in the struggle of American blacks against racist oppression. The commentary pointed out that this struggle is part of the entire world's anti-imperialist revolutionary movement.

	The commentary said that in recent times, the struggle of American blacks has gone beyond general struggles and economic demands and has become a political struggle.

	The commentary said that the struggle of American blacks is increasingly closely linked with the struggle of the American working class. American blacks, with their resolute and just struggle, are striking at the heart of imperialism, which imperialism considers "most reliable." Their struggle is making a contribution to the entire anti-imperialist revolutionary struggle of the peoples of various countries.

	The organ of the Communist Party of Australia (Marxist-Leninist), "Vanguard," published an editorial on the 27th, enthusiastically praising the heroic struggle of American blacks against violence in many cities in the United States. The editorial said that Australian workers enthusiastically support the just struggle of American blacks.

	"The Vanguard" emphasized: American blacks have come to realize that U.S. imperialists are their most vicious enemies, and the promises of U.S. imperialists are worthless. American blacks are now following the teachings of the great leader Mao Zedong and have risen up in rebellion. They have come to understand the truth that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." They are using revolutionary violence to counter revolutionary violence and have become an extremely important component of the increasingly powerful world united front against U.S. imperialism.
