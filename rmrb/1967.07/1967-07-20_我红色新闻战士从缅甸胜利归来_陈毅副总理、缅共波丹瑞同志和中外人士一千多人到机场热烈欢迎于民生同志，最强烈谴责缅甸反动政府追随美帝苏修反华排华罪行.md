Our red news warriors triumphantly return from Burma. Vice Premier Chen Yi, Burmese Communist Party comrade Bo Dan Ru, and more than a thousand Chinese and foreign people warmly welcome Comrade Yu Min Sheng, strongly condemning the Burmese reactionary government's crimes of following the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists in anti-China and expelling Chinese people.

Xinhua News Agency, July 19th: More than a thousand news workers in the capital gathered at the capital airport today to warmly welcome the Xinhua News Agency's correspondent in Rangoon, Yu Min Sheng, who returned triumphantly from Burma. They strongly protested against the Burmese Ne Win reactionary government's crimes of following the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, crazily opposing China and expelling Chinese people, and driving out Xinhua News Agency correspondents.

The revolutionary news workers from the capital who came to welcome the delegation held high portraits of Chairman Mao and plaques with Chairman Mao's quotations, repeatedly studying Chairman Mao's teachings at the airport. They decided to firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, more resolutely support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world, more resolutely oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, and spread Mao Zedong Thought all over the world.

At around 8 PM, Comrade Yu Min Sheng waved the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" as he stepped off the plane. Vice Premier Chen Yi and other comrades walked forward to shake hands with Comrade Yu Min Sheng. Yu Min Sheng excitedly said to Vice Premier Chen Yi, "All the comrades of the Chinese Embassy in Burma and the Chinese comrades working in Burma wish Chairman Mao eternal life! Eternal life! We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings: 'Resolve to overcome all difficulties, do not be afraid of sacrifice, and strive for victory.' Our heads can be cut off, our blood can flow, but Mao Zedong Thought will never be lost!"

Deputy Foreign Minister Xu Yi Xin, Deputy Director of the Foreign Affairs Committee Chu Tu Nan, former Chinese Ambassador to Burma Geng Biao, and Central Cultural Revolution Group Propaganda Group member Li Guang Wen, as well as leaders of the capital's news units Tang Ping Zhuo and Wang Wei Zhen, also shook hands warmly with Comrade Yu Min Sheng by the plane, expressing their sincere greetings. Representatives of the revolutionary news units in the capital presented Comrade Yu Min Sheng with a portrait of Chairman Mao, "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and Mao badges. At this time, the welcoming crowd enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

Bo Dan Ru, a member of the Burmese Communist Party Central Representative Team in Beijing, also came to the airport to welcome, and hugged Comrade Yu Min Sheng for a long time. The revolutionary masses shouted, "Firmly support the armed struggle of the Burmese people! Ne Win will be defeated, the Burmese Communist Party will be victorious!"

Those who came to the airport to welcome included Lu Bin, the first secretary of the All-China Journalists Association, Cha He Duo, the general secretary of the Asian-African Journalists Association, Japanese secretary of the Standing Committee Sheng Shan Shi Ping, Azania secretary Gao La Yi Bu La Xin, member of the Vietnam National Liberation Front's Permanent Representative Team in China Li Xin Yi, as well as revolutionary journalists from Albania, the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Indonesia in Beijing. Thong Love, the permanent representative abroad of the Thai Patriotic Front, and the head of the Malaysian National Liberation Alliance's Representative Team in China, Sha Er Ma, also came to the airport to welcome. They held up banners reading, "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with British imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with the Burmese reactionary government led by Ne Win! The invincible Mao Zedong Thought lives forever! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

Vice Premier Chen Yi and other comrades, along with Comrade Yu Min Sheng, circled the airport, waving red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" together with the welcoming crowd, shouting, "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Ne Win is the common enemy of the Chinese and Burmese people! Down with Ne Win! Down with the Burmese reactionary government!" The passionate slogans echoed through the airport.

Comrade Yu Min Sheng arrived in Kunming on the 17th from Rangoon. When he arrived and left Kunming, revolutionary news workers and relevant department heads in Kunming warmly welcomed and saw him off. (With picture)
