Working alone is like crossing a log bridge.
Gao Feng, a Five-Good Soldier from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army

After the liberation of the whole country, where should China's rural areas go? Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: Organize and take the path of agricultural collectivization. The path pointed out by Chairman Mao is a path of light, victory, and happiness. However, the directors of the reactionary film "Two Families" do not propagate Chairman Mao's great instructions nor do they educate the peasants to resolutely take the path of collectivization. On the contrary, they use all their strength to cheer for the capitalist roaders within the party to restore capitalism. The film extensively propagates the "superiority" of working alone, intending to tell people that as long as one works alone like Gao Zhenguo, the "five-year plan" for personal wealth will soon be realized. Things like buying cows and carriages, buying fields and land, and having money and bills will all be available, and life will become more prosperous. To propagate the "superiority" of working alone, the film does not hesitate to distort facts and maliciously slander agricultural collectivization as having "destroyed" the "joy and happiness" of the family, bringing "disaster" to people, making adults cry and children wail, causing chaos among chickens and dogs, and making the Gao Zhenguo family quarrel and the old and young not harmonious. In "Two Families," there is no sight of the high-flying red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, no sight of the magnificent movement of agricultural collectivization, no sight of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants' boundless love for Chairman Mao and their resolute walk on the socialist road, and even less sight of the prosperous scene of the rural areas after liberation. In short, the film depicts the rural areas of New China after liberation as a dark and desolate place, turning the broad and smooth road of collectivization pointed out by Chairman Mao into a "log bridge"; on the contrary, it turns the log bridge of working alone into a broad and smooth road. Seeing such a reversal of history, I was so angry that I almost burst with rage.

What kind of vine produces what kind of melon, what class speaks what words. The capitalist-roaders within the party and the reactionary filmmakers under their support think of capitalism, love capitalism, and talk about capitalism. They wield their black pens to create public opinion for the restoration of capitalism, plotting to incite the peasants to divide land and work alone, to take the backward road, and to take the capitalist road. This is absolutely impossible, a million times impossible!

　　单干就是独木桥
　　解放军某部五好战士　高峰
    全国解放以后，中国农村究竟向何处去？伟大领袖毛主席英明指出：组织起来，走农业合作化的道路。毛主席指出的这条路是光明的路、胜利的路、幸福的路。但反动影片《两家人》的编导者不宣传毛主席的伟大指示，不教育农民们坚决走合作化的道路；相反，他们使尽力气为党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派复辟资本主义摇旗呐喊。影片大肆宣扬单干的“优越性”，想以此告诉人们，只要象高正国那样坚决搞单干，那么个人发家致富的“五年计划”很快就可以实现，什么买牛置车呀，什么买田置地呀，什么金钱钞票呀，会应有尽有，小日子就会越过越兴旺。为了宣扬单干的“优越性”，影片不惜歪曲事实，恶毒地诬蔑农业合作化“毁灭”了家庭的“欢乐和幸福”，给人带来了“灾难”，弄得大人哭，孩子叫，鸡犬不宁，搞得高正国一家吵成一团，老少不和。在《两家人》里，看不到高高飘扬着的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，看不到轰轰烈烈的农业合作化的群众运动，看不到广大贫下中农无限热爱毛主席、坚决走社会主义道路的赤胆忠心，更看不到解放后农村欣欣向荣的繁荣景象。总之，影片把解放后新中国农村丑化得一片昏暗，把毛主席指出来的合作化的康庄大道，写成是“独木小桥”；相反，却把单干的独木小桥，写成了康庄大道。看了这种颠倒历史的描写，我的肺都气炸了。
    什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和他支持下的反动影片的炮制者，想的是资本主义，爱的是资本主义，讲的还是资本主义。他们摇动黑笔杆，为复辟资本主义制造舆论，阴谋煽动农民们分田单干，走回头路，走资本主义道路。这一千个办不到，一万个办不到！
