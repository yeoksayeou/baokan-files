The Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party has received a telegram of warm congratulations from the Central Committee of the Malayan Communist Party on the successful explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Party,
Dear Comrades:

At this moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has achieved decisive victories, China has successfully exploded the first hydrogen bomb. This is a historic victory shared by all revolutionary peoples of the world. The Malayan Communist Party and the Malayan people are immensely proud and delighted. We extend our warmest congratulations to you, and through you to the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army who are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We pay our highest respects to the great helmsman Mao Zedong and his close comrade-in-arms Lin Biao.

This great achievement, marking a new stage in the development of China's nuclear weapons, is another great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and another brilliant fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This victory once again demonstrates the boundless power of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Comrade Mao Zedong, and once again proves the complete bankruptcy of the revisionist line of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

The success of China's hydrogen bomb test has further broken the nuclear monopoly of U.S. and British imperialism and Soviet revisionism, and dealt a heavy blow to their nuclear blackmail policy. The imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries are trembling with fear, and their days are numbered.

The reliable base of world revolution, China, not only has atomic bombs and missiles, but now also has hydrogen bombs. This is a great encouragement and support to the Vietnamese people who are bravely fighting the war of resistance against U.S. aggression for national salvation, to the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America who are waging arduous struggles for national liberation and people's democracy, and to all revolutionary peoples of the world.

The Malayan Communist Party and the Malayan people sincerely wish the Chinese people new and more brilliant victories in opening up a new era in human history through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and in strengthening national defense and building socialism on all fronts.

Long live the great, glorious, and correct Chinese Communist Party!
Long live the invincible Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!
Long live the great leader and teacher of the revolutionary peoples of the world, Comrade Mao Zedong!

　　马来亚共产党中央热烈祝贺我第一颗氢弹爆炸成功
　　毛主席无产阶级革命路线威力无比
    新华社二日讯　中国共产党中央委员会收到马来亚共产党中央委员会写来的热烈祝贺我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功的贺信。贺信全文如下：中国共产党中央委员会：亲爱的同志们：
    在无产阶级文化大革命取得决定性胜利的时刻，中国成功地爆炸了第一颗氢弹。这是世界一切革命人民的具有历史意义的共同胜利。马来亚共产党和马来亚人民为此感到无比自豪和高兴。我们向你们，并通过你们向高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的中国人民和中国人民解放军表示最热烈的祝贺，向缔造这一胜利的伟大统帅毛泽东同志和他的亲密战友林彪同志致以最崇高的敬意。
    这个标志着中国核武器发展进入了一个崭新阶段的伟大成就，是毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一辉煌成果。这个胜利又一次显示了以毛泽东同志为代表的无产阶级革命路线的无限威力，又一次证明了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的修正主义路线的完全破产。
    中国氢弹试验的成功进一步打破了美英帝国主义和苏联修正主义的核垄断，沉重地打击了它们的核讹诈政策。帝国主义者、修正主义者和各国反动派为之胆颤心惊，它们的日子越来越不好过，它们的寿命不长了。
    世界革命的可靠根据地中国不仅有了原子弹和导弹，而且现在有了氢弹，对于正在英勇进行抗美救国战争的越南人民，对于正在为争取民族解放和人民民主而进行艰苦斗争的亚、非、拉各国人民，对于全世界一切革命人民，都是巨大的鼓舞和支持。
    马来亚共产党和马来亚人民衷心地预祝中国人民在开辟人类历史新纪元的无产阶级文化大革命中，在加强国防力量和社会主义建设的各个战线上，继续取得新的更加辉煌的成就。
    伟大的、光荣的、正确的中国共产党万岁！
    战无不胜的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！
    世界革命人民的伟大导师和领袖毛泽东同志万岁！
    马来亚共产党中央委员会
    一九六七年六月十九日
