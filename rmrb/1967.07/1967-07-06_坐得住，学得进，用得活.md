	Staying Focused, Learning Diligently, and Applying Knowledge Actively
	Capital Middle School Red Guard Congress and Peace Gate Middle School Grade 8 Class 6

	Under the guidance of the PLA comrades, all 37 students in our class come to school every morning without exception to engage in collective "Daily Reading," studying the "Three Articles," important documents, and newspaper editorials. In the afternoon, we study Chairman Mao's works in small groups, discuss important issues of the Cultural Revolution, write big-character posters, or engage in cultural activities. In the evening, we voluntarily return to school to review our thoughts and work of the day based on the spirit of Chairman Mao's works, have heart-to-heart talks, and engage in mutual assistance in thoughts. Our daily life is truly united, tense, serious, and lively. This is the result of the great thought of Mao Zedong illuminating the hearts of each of us.

	Our entire class of students being able to sit down and study Chairman Mao's works has gone through a process.

	The students in our class are all 15- or 16-year-old teenagers. After nearly a year of stopping classes to make revolution, although everyone's awareness has improved through struggle, due to not grasping the study of Chairman Mao's works tightly, discipline has slackened, and some students even do not recognize what the direction of struggle is. The PLA comrades told us that only by studying Chairman Mao's works can we grasp the direction, without studying Chairman Mao's works, we have no steering wheel, no weapon, and cannot grasp the direction of struggle. In the past, because we did not study Chairman Mao's works well, some students were deceived and carried out the bourgeois reactionary line. For a period of time, we even did not distinguish between friends and enemies, treating our comrades as enemies and attacking each other, but did not recognize the real enemy.

	Later, the PLA comrades helped us study "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," making us realize that the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party is our number one enemy. Most of the students in our class come from working-class families and have unlimited love for the Party and Chairman Mao. However, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party and the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee led by Peng Zhen, who protected him, obstinately carried out a counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, listing our class as a so-called "trial reading class," politically and pedagogically persecuting and discriminating against us, pressing us down so that we could not hold our heads up for a long time. In the Cultural Revolution, because we did not agree with the "strike a big piece" against teachers and raised objections to the work team, we were labeled as a "royalist class," causing serious disunity. The PLA comrades helped us study Chairman Mao's works, and we denounced the crimes of the bourgeois educational line and reactionary line. We understood that all the persecutions we suffered were the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie over us. Our contradiction with the bourgeoisie is a life-and-death class struggle. We directed our struggle at the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party. At the same time, through study, we loved the great leader Chairman Mao even more, and our class feelings for studying Chairman Mao's works were even stronger.

	When we decided to sit down and study Chairman Mao's works, some people said we were just putting on a show, and even said that the main thing was application. We said that without study, how can we apply? Without study, how can we imprint Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, dissolve it in our blood, and implement it in the revolutionization of our thoughts and actions?

	When studying the "Three Articles," some people said that studying the "Three Articles" was detached from the struggle between the two lines, as if only charging and fighting were the struggle between the two lines. We said this was wrong. Studying the "Three Articles," breaking private interests and establishing public interests, is the struggle between the two lines. Only by thoroughly studying the "Three Articles," truly breaking private interests and establishing public interests, and establishing a proletarian worldview, can we truly grasp the proletarian revolutionary line and thoroughly smash the bourgeois reactionary line.

	After resolving these active thoughts, we were able to stay focused, learn diligently, study with questions in mind, and apply what we learned to solve a series of contradictions in the movement.

	We studied Chairman Mao's class analysis and the viewpoint of distinguishing between enemies and friends, correctly handling the contradictions between students who were deceived and carried out the bourgeois reactionary line and students who were persecuted. Students who carried out the bourgeois reactionary line bitterly denounced and exposed the poison they received in their thoughts, and students who were persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line did not direct their spears at the deceived students but aimed straight at the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party. The targets of struggle were unified, the barriers between students were eliminated, and we truly united in thoughts, achieving class unity and jointly carrying out a thorough criticism of the revolution.

	We studied Chairman Mao's viewpoint of two-line struggle, beginning to use the weapon of criticism and self-criticism to solve the long-standing phenomenon of disunity among students. In the past, some students could not see their own advantages, only seeing their disadvantages, and thus were blindly pessimistic, only wanting to "struggle, criticize, and reform." Some students only saw their own advantages and always compared their advantages with others' disadvantages, thus attacking each other and causing chaos in the class. Through studying Chairman Mao's works and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions: "We should regard ourselves as a force for the revolution, and at the same time, we should constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution," we seriously carried out criticism and self-criticism, helped each other, sent each other quotations from Chairman Mao, and encouraged each other. Everyone did ideological work. Now, the 37 male and female students in the class are united like one person.

	We seriously studied Chairman Mao's viewpoint of correctly handling contradictions among the people, solving the problem of correctly treating teachers. In the past, due to the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line's "strike a big piece," it caused opposition between students and teachers. At the beginning of military training, some teachers came to the class to study with us, but some students did not recognize this and drove them away. The PLA comrades helped us study Chairman Mao's viewpoint of correctly handling contradictions among the people, and the teachers also denounced the persecution they suffered from the bourgeois reactionary line. We realized that the contradictions and opposition between teachers and us were caused by the bourgeois educational line and reactionary line. They are our teachers and also our revolutionary comrades-in-arms. Only by closely uniting teachers and students can we truly eliminate all the poison of the bourgeois educational line and reactionary line, truly carry out the struggle, criticism, and reform of the school. The teachers also put down their airs and truly blended in with us. Now, the teachers in the class sit with us every day to study Chairman Mao's works, have heart-to-heart talks, expose their thoughts, and jointly participate in the battle. We respect the teachers, and the teachers also care for us and cherish us. Teachers and students help each other, study together, and fight shoulder to shoulder.

	Who could have imagined that our class, which was once looked down upon as a "trial reading class," has now become one of the advanced classes in the school with good study and revolution? All of this is brought to us by the great Chairman Mao, the great Mao Zedong Thought, and the great People's Liberation Army. We are still just children. On the long march of the revolution, we have only just taken the first step. We must read Chairman Mao's books for life, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and follow Chairman Mao to do revolution for life!

　　坐得住，学得进，用得活
    首都中学红代会和平门中学初二六班
    在解放军同志帮助下，我们全班三十七个同学每天早晨一个不拉地来到学校，坐在班里集体坚持“天天读”，学习“老三篇”，学习重要的文件和报纸社论。下午分小组学习毛主席著作，讨论文化革命的重要问题，写大字报或开展文娱活动。晚上我们还自动来到学校，根据毛主席著作精神检查一天的思想和工作，相互谈心，展开思想互助。我们每天的生活真是过得团结、紧张、严肃、活泼啊。这是伟大的毛泽东思想照亮了我们每个同学心坎的结果。
    我们全班同学能够坐下来学习毛主席著作是经历了一个过程的。
    我们班的同学都是十五六岁的青少年。停课闹革命将近一年来，大家在斗争中觉悟虽有所提高，但因对毛主席著作的学习抓得不紧，学习纪律松弛了，坐不下来，有的同学甚至认不清什么是斗争大方向。解放军同志告诉我们学习毛主席著作才能掌握大方向，不学习毛主席著作就没有方向盘，就没有武器，就掌握不住斗争的大方向。过去我们就因为没有好好学习毛主席著作，一部分同学受了蒙蔽，执行了资产阶级反动路线。有一时期，我们甚至没有分清敌友，把自己的同志当做敌人，互相攻击，却没有认清真正的敌人。
    后来，解放军同志帮助我们学习《中国社会各阶级的分析》，使我们认清党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派是我们的头号敌人。我们班绝大多数同学是劳动人民家庭出身，对党对毛主席无限热爱。可是，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派和他包庇的以彭真为首的旧北京市委，顽固执行了一条反革命修正主义教育路线，把我们班列为所谓“试读班”，在政治上和教学上迫害和歧视我们，压得我们长期抬不起头来。在文化大革命中，因为我们不同意对教师“打击一大片”，对工作组提了意见，又把我们班打成“保皇班”，造成严重的不团结。解放军同志帮助我们学习了毛主席著作，我们全班同学愤怒控诉资产阶级教育路线和反动路线的罪恶。我们懂得了我们所受的一切迫害都是资产阶级对我们的专政。我们和资产阶级的矛盾是你死我活的阶级斗争。我们把斗争矛头一致指向党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派。同时，经过学习我们更加热爱伟大领袖毛主席，更加激发了我们学习毛主席著作的强烈的阶级感情。
    当我们决心坐下来学习毛主席著作的时候，有人说我们是装样子，还说什么主要是用的问题。我们说不学习，怎么会用？不学习，怎能把毛泽东思想印在我们的脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实在思想革命化和行动中呢？
    学习“老三篇”时，有人说学“老三篇”脱离了两条路线斗争，似乎只有冲冲打打才是两条路线斗争。我们说这话不对，学“老三篇”，破私立公，就是两条路线斗争。只有大学“老三篇”，真正破私立公，树立无产阶级的世界观，才能真正掌握无产阶级的革命路线，大破资产阶级的反动路线。
    解决了这些活思想后，我们坐得住，学得进，带着问题学，学了就用，解决了运动中的一系列矛盾。
    我们学习了毛主席的阶级分析、分清敌我友的观点，正确处理了受蒙蔽执行资产阶级反动路线的同学和受迫害的同学之间的矛盾。执行资产阶级反动路线的同学痛心地控诉和揭发自己在思想上所受的毒害，受资产阶级反动路线迫害的同学矛头丝毫没有指向受蒙蔽的同学，而是直指党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派。斗争的目标一致了，同学之间的隔阂消除了，在思想上真正团结起来，实现了班级大联合，共同搞好革命的大批判。
    我们学习了毛主席一分为二的观点，开始运用批评自我批评的武器，解决了同学间长期存在的不团结现象。过去，有的同学看不见自己的优点，只看到缺点，因而盲目悲观，只想“斗批走”。有的同学只看到自己的优点，总用自己的优点和别人的缺点比，因此互相攻击，造成班上的混乱。通过学习毛主席著作和林彪副主席的指示：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象”，我们认真开展了批评自我批评，互相帮助，互相送毛主席语录，互相鼓励。人人做思想工作。现在，班上三十七个男女同学，团结得象一个人似的。
    我们认真学习了毛主席正确处理人民内部矛盾的观点，解决了正确对待老师的问题。过去由于资产阶级反动路线“打击一大片”的影响，造成了同学和老师之间的对立。开始军训时，有的老师到班上和我们一起学习，有的同学认识不清，轰他们走。解放军同志帮助我们学习了毛主席的正确处理人民内部矛盾的观点，老师也控诉了资产阶级反动路线对他们的迫害。我们认识到老师和我们之间的矛盾和对立是资产阶级教育路线和反动路线造成的，他们是我们的老师，也是我们的革命战友。只有师生紧密地团结一起，才能真正肃清资产阶级教育路线和反动路线的一切流毒，真正搞好学校的斗批改。老师也放下了架子，真正和我们打成一片。现在，班上的老师天天和我们坐在一起学习毛主席著作，一起谈心，一起亮思想，共同参加战斗。我们尊重老师，老师也非常关心我们，爱护我们。师生互相帮助，共同学习，并肩战斗。
    谁能想象到我们这个一向被瞧不起的“试读班”，现在成为全校学习和革命搞得好的先进班之一呢？所有的一切都是伟大的毛主席、伟大的毛泽东思想、伟大的人民解放军带给我们的。我们都还是一些孩子，在革命的长征途上，只是刚刚迈开了第一步。我们一定要一辈子读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，跟着毛主席干一辈子革命！
