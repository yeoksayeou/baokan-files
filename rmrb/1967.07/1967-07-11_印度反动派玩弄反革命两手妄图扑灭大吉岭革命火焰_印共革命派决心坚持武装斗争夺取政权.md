The Indian reactionary government is intensifying its use of two counter-revolutionary tactics in an attempt to extinguish the revolutionary flame of the armed peasant struggle led by the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India in Darjeeling District.

The Indian reactionary government is preparing for a bloody suppression of the peasant revolutionary movement in Darjeeling District. According to a report by an Indian journalist on July 1, "More than 1,500 state police are waiting for the signal to attack the strongholds of the leftist Communist extremists." The *Indian Express* reported on July 5, "The West Bengal government has tonight given the police a free hand to take all necessary measures to combat the lawless situation in Naxalbari." It added, "The police can arrest anyone they consider necessary. At present, about 800 people are wanted by the police." The report continued, "More police camps will be established, and patrols will be strengthened." On July 6, the *Indian Express* reported that the police authorities have divided the so-called "rebel" strongholds, large and small, into five regions, each with nearly 300 police officers. Special police trained in jungle warfare have been sent to Naxalbari.

At the same time, the Indian reactionary government is using the trick of "land distribution" to carry out new political deception. According to a report by the *Hindustan Times* on July 2, a member of the delegation sent by the West Bengal Legislative Assembly and Cabinet to Naxalbari, the state irrigation minister Biswanath Mukherjee, recently boasted of "resolutely suppressing" the peasant struggle in the area, and then immediately announced that the government has decided to establish "land committees" at all levels "to immediately handle cases truly reflecting discontent, such as land seizures, etc." The *Indian Express* reported that it was this Biswanath Mukherjee who told news reporters on July 3 that the land committees established by the government in Naxalbari would distribute land to peasants in three of the strongest "strongholds" of peasant armed forces in the next three to five days. The Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mukherjee, admitted: The state government has decided to isolate the so-called "extremists" leading the peasant armed struggle in Naxalbari and other areas to restore "normalcy" there. He said, "To implement the 'isolation' policy, the cabinet has taken certain new steps. These measures include speeding up land reform and land distribution work."

Indian newspapers have also openly revealed the evil intentions of the Indian reactionary government's conspiracy. The *Indian Express* reported on June 30 that while the revolutionary faction of the CPI is leading the peasants to "prepare for a long struggle," the ministers of the state government hope to win over the peasants from the "rebels" through rapid land distribution. "Once the peasants are won over, the task of overthrowing the leadership will be easier."

The revolutionary faction of the CPI and the rebellious peasants have launched a struggle against the reactionary government's evil conspiracy. They publicly declared: "Naxalbari has lit a fire that illuminates a new path, and this fire will continue to burn." The armed struggle of the Naxalbari peasants "is no longer just a land issue, but a political issue—namely, the issue of liberating the Naxalbari peasants from the rule of the 'revisionist'-supported 'bourgeois-controlled' government." In a broader sense, "this is a struggle for seizing power," a question of which class comes to power and for whose interests: the laboring people or a small number of privileged individuals?

The threats and inducements of the reactionary government against the rebellious peasants of Darjeeling have all met with shameful failure.

According to official Indian sources, the deadline set by the state government for the so-called "rebels" to surrender expired at midnight on July 4, but not a single member of the revolutionary faction of the CPI and the rebellious peasants surrendered to the police. Instead, it was reported that "the wanted rebel leaders are freely active, collecting weapons and encouraging tribal people to resist the police," calling on peasants to "prepare for armed struggle," and actively "preparing for a long struggle" from all sides.

The reactionary government's conspiracy of "land distribution" has also failed. The Indian News Agency reported on July 6: "The meeting of the land distribution committee for the Naxalbari police station area scheduled for Monday (July 3) could not be held because no one came to attend."

    印度反动派玩弄反革命两手妄图扑灭大吉岭革命火焰
    印共革命派决心坚持武装斗争夺取政权
    据新华社十日讯　新德里消息：印度反动政府正在加紧玩弄反革命两手，妄图扑灭印度共产党革命派领导的大吉岭县农民武装斗争的革命火焰。
    印度反动政府正在加紧准备对大吉岭县农民革命运动进行血腥镇压。据印度记者一日报道：“一千五百多名邦政府警察正在等待着袭击左派共产党极端分子的根据地的信号。”《印度快报》五日说：“西孟加拉邦政府今晚已让警察放手采取一切必要的措施去同纳萨尔巴里的无法无天现象作斗争。”“警察可以逮捕他们认为需要逮捕的任何人。目前，约有八百人被警察通缉。”“将建立更多的警察营地，巡逻将加强。”六日，《印度快报》又报道，警察当局把大大小小的所谓“叛乱”据点分成了五个区域，每个区域配备近三百名警察。受过丛林战训练的特别警察已被派到纳萨尔巴里。
    与此同时，印度反动政府又用所谓“分配土地”的花招，进行新的政治欺骗。据《印度斯坦旗报》二日报道，西孟加拉邦议会和内阁派到纳萨尔巴里去的代表团的成员、邦灌溉部长比斯瓦纳特·慕克吉最近在扬言“坚决镇压”这个地区的农民斗争后，又紧接着宣布政府已决定立即在各级成立“土地委员会”，“授权它们立即处理有关夺佃等等的真正反映不满情绪的案件”。《印度快报》报道，就是这个比斯瓦纳特·慕克吉在三日告诉新闻记者说，政府在纳萨尔巴里建立的土地委员会将在三、四、五日几天内，在三个农民武装力量最强的“据点”将土地分配给农民。西孟加拉邦首席部长慕克吉供认：邦政府决定把纳萨尔巴里和其他地区领导农民武装斗争的所谓“极端分子”孤立起来，以恢复那里“正常状况”。他说：“为了执行‘孤立’的政策，内阁已采取某些新的步骤。这些措施包括加速土地改革和分配土地的工作。”
    印度报纸也十分露骨地透露了印度反动政府这一阴谋的罪恶目的。《印度快报》六月三十日刊载的消息，在讲到印共革命派正在领导农民“为长期斗争作准备”后说，“但是（邦政府）部长们希望通过迅速分地，把农民从‘叛乱分子’那里争取过来……一旦农民被争取过来了，打倒领导的任务也就容易了。”
    印共革命派和起义农民对反动政府的这种罪恶阴谋展开了针锋相对的斗争。他们公开宣布：“纳萨尔巴里点燃了照亮一条新的道路之火，这个火将继续烧下去。”纳萨尔巴里农民开展的武装斗争“已不再是土地问题，而是一个政治问题——即纳萨尔巴里农民从得到‘新修正主义者’支持的‘资产阶级控制的’政府统治下解放出来的问题”，从更广泛的意义来说，“这是一场夺取政权的斗争”，是由哪个阶级来掌权和为了谁的利益的问题：是劳动人民群众呢，还是少数特权人物呢？
    印度反动政府对大吉岭起义农民进行的种种的威胁、利诱，在坚持斗争的起义农民面前都遭到了可耻的失败。
    据印度官方消息，邦政府规定的所谓“叛乱分子自首”的限期在七月四日午夜截止时，印共革命派和起义农民没有一个人向警察去投降自首。相反，据报道，“被通缉的叛乱领袖们正在自由活动，搜集武器和鼓励部族人抵抗警察”，号召农民“准备进行武装斗争”，并正从各方面积极“为长期斗争作准备”。
    印度反动政府的“分配土地”的阴谋也没有得逞。印度报业托辣斯六日报道：“原定在星期一（三日）在哈提吉夏举行的纳萨尔巴里警察分局辖区土地分配委员会会议没有能够召开，因为没有一个人来参加。”
