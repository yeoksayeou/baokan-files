The British authorities in Hong Kong are struggling in vain and continue to arbitrarily arrest our patriotic compatriots. The broad masses of patriotic compatriots are determined to double their efforts to retaliate against the fascist atrocities of the British Empire.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong on the 2nd, after the British imperialists in Hong Kong consecutively created bloody incidents, they recently dispatched police and secret agents to secretly kidnap and arbitrarily arrest residents, continuing to provoke the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong in a maddened manner.

The massive workers' united strike has politically and economically dealt a heavy blow to the reactionary rule of the British authorities in Hong Kong. The British authorities are terrified and enraged by this main force of resistance, attempting to use illegal arrests to sabotage the strike. On the 27th of June, the British police and secret agents separately kidnapped eight striking workers from Taikoo Dockyard and Nan Fung Cotton Mill in the early morning and at midnight; on the 28th, British secret agents publicly kidnapped cotton mill workers in the bustling streets; on the 29th, they kidnapped bank employees. This is another new atrocity by the British authorities in Hong Kong following their two kidnappings of striking workers in mid-June.

In recent times, the British authorities in Hong Kong have also illegally arrested seven compatriots who were selling and distributing extra editions of the *Wen Wei Po* and *Ta Kung Pao* newspapers, and brazenly shot and injured one of them. On the 26th and 28th, they arrested two students for allegedly "posting slogans" and "hiding inciting slogans."

On the 25th, British police in the streets of Hong Kong's Central District beat and kidnapped four middle school students, aggressively questioning them: "The Governor, David Trench, will be passing through here today to leave for England on vacation. Why are you walking here? Do you intend to 'murder' David Trench?" The British authorities are so afraid of unarmed, teenage students passing by that it fully exposes the British authorities' panic and extreme weakness in the face of this large-scale anti-British resistance movement.

The British fascist authorities have illegally kidnapped and arrested a large number of workers, students, and bank employees, sparking the indignation of patriotic compatriots. They have expressed their determination to more resolutely retaliate with double the force against the fascist atrocities of the British authorities in Hong Kong.

　　港英当局垂死挣扎　继续滥捕我爱国同胞
    广大爱国同胞决心加倍回击英帝法西斯暴行
    据新华社香港二日电　港英帝国主义在接二连三地制造了流血事件之后，最近又出动警察特务秘密绑架和滥捕居民，继续向香港中国同胞疯狂地进行挑衅。
    声势浩大的工人联合大罢工，在政治上经济上沉重地打击了港英当局的反动统治。港英当局对这支抗暴主力军怕得要死，恨得要命，妄图用非法逮捕来破坏大罢工。六月二十七日，港英警察和特务，分别在清晨和半夜绑架了太古船坞和南丰纱厂八名罢工工人；二十八日港英特务公然在闹市绑架纱厂工人；二十九日又绑架了银行职工。这是港英当局继六月中旬两次绑架罢工工人后的又一次新暴行。
    最近时期，港英当局还一连非法逮捕了七名售卖和派送《文汇报》、《大公报》号外的同胞，并悍然开枪击伤其中一人。二十六日和二十八日，又逮捕了所谓“贴标语”和“藏有煽动性标语”的两名学生。
    二十五日，港英警察在香港中区的街道上毒打和绑架四名中学生，气势汹汹地“审问”他们：“总督”戴麟趾今天将要途经这里离港赴英“度假”，你们偏偏要在这里行走，是否要“谋杀”戴麟趾？港英当局对手无寸铁、年仅十几岁的过路青年学生竟怕到如此地步，充分暴露了港英当局在这场大规模的反英抗暴的群众运动面前，惶惶不安，极其虚弱的本质。
    港英法西斯当局非法绑架和逮捕了大批工人、学生、银行职工等，激起了爱国同胞的无比愤慨。他们表示要更加坚决地以双倍的力量来回击港英当局的法西斯暴行。
