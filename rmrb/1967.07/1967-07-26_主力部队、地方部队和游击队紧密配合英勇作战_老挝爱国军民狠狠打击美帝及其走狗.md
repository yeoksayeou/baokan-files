The patriotic military and civilian forces of Laos, building on last year's victories, have continued to unleash the immense power of people's war. In their battles against U.S. imperialism and its running dogs, they have achieved new victories.

Since the beginning of this year, the patriotic military and civilian forces of Laos, with close cooperation among the main force troops, local troops, and guerrillas, have thwarted the enemy's numerous offensives. They have also taken the initiative to launch attacks, inflicting heavy blows on the enemy and consolidating and expanding the liberated areas. Preliminary statistics show that in the first five months of this year, the patriotic military and civilian forces of Laos annihilated nearly 5,000 enemy troops.

Since the beginning of this year, U.S. imperialism has intensified its attacks on the liberated areas of Laos to support its aggression in Vietnam and to salvage its failing situation there. At the end of last year, the United States strengthened and reorganized the rightist military forces of Laos and sent more American "advisors." It then directed the rightist military forces to launch multiple "sweeps" into the liberated areas. In January and March, U.S. imperialism and its running dogs dispatched more than ten battalions of troops, under the cover of U.S. aircraft and artillery, to launch large-scale attacks on the liberated areas of Xam Neua, Attapeu, and the northern and southern regions of Xieng Khouang. The patriotic military and civilian forces of Laos stood ready and struck back, smashing the enemy's "sweeps." In the January battles, the military and civilian forces of the southern region annihilated nearly 900 enemy troops in just five days.

The large-scale "sweeps" by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs failed, so they resorted to "eating away" at the liberated areas, sending large numbers of bandits and special forces along with the rightist military to attack. However, the Lao People's Liberation Army, in coordination with the people's armed forces, launched extensive counterattacks and bandit-suppression operations, foiling the enemy's schemes and defending the liberated areas.

The patriotic military and civilian forces of Laos not only gave the enemy a fierce welcome when they dared to invade but also took the initiative to launch attacks, annihilating large numbers of the enemy's fighting forces. In April, the local troops and guerrillas of Luang Prabang Province, with the assistance of the local people, launched a fierce attack on the enemy troops stationed in the Ban Seng area of Ban Xieng Ngeun District, liberating the area. Recently, the patriotic military and civilian forces of Luang Prabang Province attacked an enemy convoy, sinking twelve patrol boats and killing one hundred enemy troops. In the first five months of this year, the patriotic military and civilian forces of Xieng Khouang and Sam Neua Provinces, while thwarting enemy attacks, also launched fierce assaults on enemy positions, annihilating more than 1,300 enemy troops and shooting down seventeen U.S. aircraft.

From the plains to the mountains, the people of Laos have widely launched guerrilla warfare. The guerrillas, in coordination with the main force troops and local troops, have struck the enemy everywhere, making the enemy suffer in the vast sea of people's war.

U.S. imperialism often boasts of its "air superiority," continually bombing the liberated areas of Laos with various aircraft, including B-52s, in an attempt to subjugate the people of Laos. However, the Lao People's Liberation Army and guerrillas have retaliated with various light and heavy weapons, shooting down more than 600 U.S. aircraft in the sky and raiding U.S. military airfields. In February, the guerrillas of Luang Prabang Province raided the Luang Prabang airfield, destroying eleven enemy aircraft and annihilating an entire enemy company. On the morning of July 16, the Lao guerrillas again launched a fierce attack on the Luang Prabang airfield, about three kilometers from the Royal Palace of Laos. In just twenty minutes, they blew up twelve U.S.-made T-28 type bombers.

In addition to actively coordinating with the main force troops and local troops to bravely fight the enemy day and night, the Lao guerrillas have also intensified production to support the front lines, enabling the people's war to develop more broadly. No matter how desperately U.S. imperialism struggles, it will surely be drowned in the vast sea of the people's war in Laos.

	In the land of Laos, the broad masses of militia and guerrillas have laid a net to annihilate the invading American aggressors at any time. Many Lao women have also taken up arms, playing a significant role in the struggle.

    主力部队、地方部队和游击队紧密配合英勇作战
    老挝爱国军民狠狠打击美帝及其走狗
    本报讯　老挝爱国军民在去年胜利的基础上，继续发挥人民战争的巨大威力，在同美帝国主义及其走狗的战斗中，不断取得新的胜利。
    今年以来，老挝爱国军民在主力部队、地方部队和游击队紧密配合下，粉碎了美帝国主义及其走狗的多次进攻，并且主动出击，给敌人以沉重打击，巩固和扩大了解放区。据初步统计，今年头五个月，老挝爱国军民歼灭敌人近五千名。
    美帝国主义从今年年初以来，特别加紧对老挝解放区的进攻，以便配合侵越战争，挽救它在越南的败局。去年年底美国大力整顿和改组老挝右派军队，增派美国“顾问”。后又指使右派军队向解放区发动多次“扫荡”。今年一月和三月，美帝国主义及其走狗先后出动十多个营的军队，在美国飞机大炮掩护下，向沙拉湾、阿速坡和南博北部、南达地区等解放区大举进攻。老挝爱国军民严阵以待迎头痛击，打垮了敌人的“扫荡”。在一月份的战斗中，下寮地区军民仅以五天时间，就消灭敌人近九百名。
    美帝国主义及其走狗的大规模“扫荡”破产了，就不断进行“蚕食”，派遣大批土匪和别动队同右派军队一起进攻解放区。但是老挝解放军在人民武装配合下，广泛展开反击战和剿匪工作，粉碎了敌人的阴谋，保卫了解放区。
    老挝爱国军民不仅给敢于来犯的敌人以迎头痛击，还主动出击，大批歼灭敌人的有生力量。四月间，琅勃拉邦省地方部队和游击队，在当地人民协助下，猛烈袭击驻扎在巴森县班射地区敌军，解放了这个地区。最近，老挝琅勃拉邦省爱国军民袭击敌人船队，击沉机动艇十二艘，打死敌人一百名。今年头五个月中，老挝川圹省和桑怒省爱国军民在粉碎敌人进攻的同时，还向敌人阵地发动猛烈袭击，歼灭敌军一千三百多人，击落美国飞机十七架。
    从平原到山区，老挝人民广泛开展游击战争。游击队同主力部队、地方部队协同作战，神出鬼没，使敌人处处挨打，陷在人民战争的汪洋大海之中。
    美帝国主义经常吹嘘它的“空中优势”，不断用包括B—52在内的各种飞机对老挝解放区狂轰滥炸，妄图征服老挝人民。但是老挝解放军和游击队针锋相对，不仅用各种轻重武器，在天空中揍掉了美国六百多架飞机，而且奇袭美军机场。二月间，老挝琅勃拉邦省游击队袭击了琅勃拉邦机场，一举击毁敌机十一架，全部歼灭敌人一个连。七月十六日凌晨，老挝游击队再次猛袭离老挝王宫大约三公里的琅勃拉邦机场，只用二十分钟时间，就炸毁了十二架美制T—28型轰炸机。
    老挝游击队除了积极配合主力部队和地方部队，不分昼夜英勇打击敌人外，还加紧生产，支援前线，使人民战争得到更广泛的发展。不论美帝国主义怎样疯狂挣扎，它在老挝人民战争的汪洋大海中必将被活活淹死。
