Welcome, welcome, welcome to our most intimate comrades from the heroic nation, from the frontline of the anti-American struggle—comrades from the South Vietnamese Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe.

You have brought the battle songs from the Long Mountains, the gunpowder from the banks of the Mekong River, the heartfelt sentiments of the South Vietnamese people, and the news of victories over the enemy to your rear base, to the heart of the People's Republic of China, to the birthplace of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, to the place where the reddest red sun in the hearts of 700 million Chinese people, Chairman Mao Zedong, resides—Beijing.

The Kunlun Mountains connect with the peaks of the Long Mountains, and the waters of the Yangtze River connect with the waves of the Mekong River. The peoples of China and Vietnam will forever stand together, fight together, and win together.

With hearts full of excitement, we watched your splendid performance. The stirring scenes moved our hearts deeply and left us unable to calm down for a long time. How many familiar place names, how many familiar events, and how many cherished feelings all rushed into our minds at once. Our struggles, revolutionary passion, and heroic deeds are so similar, so much the same!

Places like Tam Me and the Western Highlands, though we have not been there, our hearts have flown to those places a thousand, ten thousand times. The agile figures of the female guerrillas in Tam Me, the powerful labor songs; the heroic posture of the Western Highlands people fighting the enemy, the stirring songs—all seem so familiar and dear.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "What is the real iron wall? It is the people, the thousands and tens of thousands of people who truly support the revolution. This is the real iron wall, which no force can break, completely unbreakable. The counter-revolutionaries cannot break us, but we will break the counter-revolutionaries." Chairman Mao's great thoughts on people's war are the most powerful weapon for revolutionary people to defeat the enemy. In the past, we used people's war to defeat the supposedly powerful Japanese imperialism and the anti-revolutionary forces of the U.S. and the Kuomintang, driving them to defeat. Today, the people of South Vietnam are similarly using the strategies and tactics of people's war to defeat the U.S. imperialists, who are armed to the teeth, making them suffer greatly and setting a brilliant example for revolutionary people all over the world. Many of the performances by the Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe vividly demonstrate this point. For example, the dance "Mother of the South" successfully portrays the strength and wisdom of the people, vividly showing the blood-bond between the military and the people. The dance creates the heroic image of a revolutionary mother who covers up wounded soldiers of the Liberation Army and eliminates American invaders. When the wounded guerrilla fighter collapses at the village entrance while being pursued by the enemy, the mother immediately rallies the villagers to hide him, while she herself picks up the grenade left by the guerrilla fighter and walks towards the enemy. The enemy tries to force information about the guerrilla fighter's whereabouts from the mother, using various threats and inducements. Finally, they even set up a fire on the spot and cruelly burn her young daughter, attempting to shake the mother's revolutionary resolve with "family ties." The mother denounces the enemy's atrocities and ultimately, with clever tactics, eliminates the enemy, saves her daughter, and escapes the danger herself. In this short dance, the enemy's ferocity is deeply exposed, and the immense power of people's war is prominently expressed.

The dances "Female Guerrillas of Tam Me" and "Defending the Homeland" also vividly depict the power of people's war. "Female Guerrillas of Tam Me" uses vivid dance language to depict the scene of the South Vietnamese guerrillas combining labor and military training. They are labor heroes in peacetime, using their hardworking hands to support the liberation war of the motherland. But at the sound of a cannon, they draw the swords stuck in the fields and instantly transform into a squad of heroic warriors. They use these simple weapons to defeat the American invaders. The dance movements are clear and powerful, the structure is tight, the theme is clear, and it is filled with the atmosphere of battle life, leaving a deep impression.

The singing and instrumental performances by the South Vietnamese Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe not only express the South Vietnamese soldiers' firm resolve to completely eliminate U.S. imperialism, liberate the South, and unify the country, but also express the South Vietnamese people's love for our great leader Chairman Mao, and the deep feelings between the peoples of China and Vietnam. The songs they performed, such as "For the Female Militia," "On the Golden Mountain in Beijing," "The Three-Eight Spirit Song," and "The People of Asia, Africa, and Latin America Want Liberation," were all warmly received by the audience. The most unforgettable was the male solo. The baritone soloist Chen Yong, with his passionate emotions and powerful, resonant voice, sang out the heroic spirit of the world's people loving Chairman Mao. "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" and "Long Live Chairman Mao" became one of the most popular performances of the evening. We have shared experiences, shared enemies, shared ideals, and shared goals. How could we not use shared songs to express our shared sincere feelings from the bottom of our hearts? The songs sung by our Vietnamese comrades on stage are the same songs sung every day by 700 million Chinese people, and they are the songs that revolutionary people all over the world should sing. Shared songs bind our hearts even more closely. Let us stand shoulder to shoulder, hand in hand, and march forward bravely, driving U.S. imperialism out of South Vietnam, out of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, out of all the places it has occupied! Let us create a new world of red, and forever stand together, fight together, and win together.

The comrades of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe are mostly from the ranks of soldiers and officers. The troupe was developed from an amateur performance team. Therefore, they have always lived and fought with the troops, sharing a blood bond with them. They often perform on the front lines of fierce battles for the soldiers of the Liberation Army, organizing mass cultural activities, transporting military supplies, carrying stretchers, mending clothes, and even directly participating in battles. We must learn from their revolutionary fighting spirit and resolutely support their revolutionary actions to resist the Americans and save the nation!

The performance ended, but our hearts were not separated by the curtain, just as the song "Victory Is with Us" sings:

Our hatred is together,
Our anger is together,
Together, our hearts and blood,
Together, our pulses and breaths.
We raise the revolutionary red flag and march forward side by side,
We share life and death, we are inseparable.
We have our beloved Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho,
Victory is always with us.

Female chorus: Chairman Mao's poem "For the Female Militia"
Dance: "The Flag of Victory Flies High"

　　胜利永远和我们在一起
　　——越南南方解放军歌舞团演出观后感
　　陆海空驻京部队无产阶级革命派文体战士联合演出委员会
    欢迎，欢迎，欢迎来自英雄的国家，来自反美斗争最前哨的我们最亲密的战友——越南南方解放军歌舞团的同志们。
    你们带着长山上战斗的歌声，带着湄公河两岸的硝烟，带着越南南方人民的心意，带着杀敌的捷报来到了你们的大后方，来到了中华人民共和国的心脏，无产阶级文化大革命的策源地，七亿中国人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席居住的地方——北京。
    昆仑山连接着长山高峰，长江水连接着湄公河的浪涛。中越两国人民世世代代要团结在一起、战斗在一起、胜利在一起。
    我们怀着十分激动的心情，观看了你们精彩的演出，那激动人心的场景，使我们的心久久不能平静。有多少熟悉的地名，有多少熟悉的事件，有多少亲切的感情，一下都涌现在我们的眼前。我们斗争的经历，革命的激情，杀敌的壮举，是多么相同，多么一样啊！
    同塔梅、西原，这些英雄的地方，我们虽然没有到过，但是我们的心，却早已一千遍一万遍地飞向过那些地方。同塔梅女游击队员的矫健身影，雄浑有力的劳动号子；西原人民杀敌的雄姿，高亢动人的歌声，看起来听起来都是那样的亲切熟悉。
    毛主席教导我们：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。”毛主席关于人民战争的伟大思想，是革命人民战胜敌人的最强大的武器。过去，我们运用人民战争，把号称强大的日本帝国主义、美蒋反动派打得落花流水；今天，越南南方人民同样以人民战争的战略战术，把武装到牙齿的美帝国主义打得焦头烂额，为全世界革命人民树立了光辉榜样。解放军歌舞团演出的许多节目中都鲜明地表现出了这一点。例如，舞蹈《南方的母亲》就成功地表现出了人民群众的力量和机智，生动地表现了军民亲如一家的血肉关系，舞蹈塑造了一位掩护解放军伤员消灭美国强盗的革命妈妈的英雄形象。当负伤的游击队员，在敌人的追捕下，昏倒在村头时，母亲毫不犹豫地召集乡亲们把他掩蔽起来，她自己却托起游击队员丢下的炸药包，迎着敌人走上前去。敌人为了从母亲口中问出游击队员的下落，对她施加了各种威逼利诱，最后竟然当场架起火堆，残忍地烧她的小女儿，妄图以“骨肉之情”来动摇母亲的革命决心。母亲痛斥了敌人的暴行，最后以巧妙的办法，消灭了敌人，救出了女儿，自己也摆脱了险境。在一个短短的舞蹈中，深刻地暴露了敌人的狰狞残暴，突出地表达出人民战争的强大威力。
    《同塔梅的女游击队》和《保卫家园》这两个舞蹈，同样是表现人民战争的威力的。《同塔梅的女游击队》通过生动的舞蹈语言，表现了越南南方游击队员劳武结合的情景。她们平时是劳动能手，用自己勤劳的双手支援祖国的解放战争。但是，一声炮响，她们拔出了插在田塍上的刀剑，马上变成了一队英姿飒爽的战士。她们就用这种简陋的武器战胜了美国侵略者。舞蹈动作明快有力，结构严紧，主题鲜明，带着浓厚的战斗生活气息，使人久久难忘。
    越南南方解放军歌舞团的歌唱和器乐演奏，不仅表达了越南南方战士为彻底消灭美帝国主义，解放南方，统一祖国的坚强决心，而且也表达了越南南方人民对我们伟大领袖毛主席的热爱，表达了中越两国人民之间的深厚感情。他们演唱的《为女民兵题照》、《在北京的金山上》、《三八作风歌》、《亚非拉人民要解放》等中国歌曲，都受到了观众极为热烈的欢迎。最最使人难忘的是男声独唱。男中音独唱演员陈勇同志以他饱满的感情，高亢雄壮的声音，唱出了世界人民热爱毛主席的豪迈激情。《大海航行靠舵手》、《万岁！毛主席》，成了晚会最受欢迎的节目之一。我们有着共同的经历，共同的敌人，共同的理想，共同的目标，我们又怎能不用共同的歌声，来表达出我们共同的真挚的心底之音呢！台上越南战友唱的，正是七亿中国人民天天歌唱的，正是世界革命人民所要歌唱的，共同的歌声把我们的心连得更紧。让我们肩并肩手挽手奋勇前进，把美帝国主义从越南南方赶出去，从亚非拉赶出去，从它所侵占的一切地方赶出去！创出一个红彤彤的新天地，我们永远团结在一起、战斗在一起、胜利在一起。
    越南南方解放军歌舞团的同志们大都是从战士干部中来的，歌舞团是在业余演出队的基础上发展起来的。因而，他们一直和部队生活在一起、战斗在一起，和部队有着血肉的关系。他们经常活跃在战火纷飞的前线，为解放军战士演出，开展群众性的文娱活动，担负运输军粮、抬担架、缝补衣服等工作，甚至直接参加战斗。我们要学习他们这种革命的战斗精神，我们坚决支持他们抗美救国的革命行动！
    晚会的演出结束了，但我们的心并没有被帷幕所隔断，正象《胜利和我们在一起》那首歌中所唱的：
　　我们的仇恨在一起，
　　我们的愤怒在一起，
　　在一起，我们的心脏和血液，
　　在一起，我们的脉搏和呼吸。
　　我们高举革命红旗，并肩前进，
　　我们生死与共，唇齿相依。
　　我们有敬爱的毛主席和胡主席，
　　胜利永远和我们在一起。（附图片）
