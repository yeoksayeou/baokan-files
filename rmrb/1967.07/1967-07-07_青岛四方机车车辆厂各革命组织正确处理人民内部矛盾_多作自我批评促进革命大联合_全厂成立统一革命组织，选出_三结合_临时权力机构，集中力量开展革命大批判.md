The revolutionary organizations of Qingdao Sifang Locomotive and Rolling Stock Plant have studied "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and used the method of "unity-criticism-unity" to conduct serious self-criticism. They have resolved long-standing contradictions among the revolutionary organizations and achieved new unity on a new basis, realizing the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses.

This factory originally had four major revolutionary organizations. In the struggle against the bourgeois reactionary line, the largest organization, the "Work-Study Command Department," played a significant role. The other three organizations also effectively cooperated with the "Work-Study Command Department." However, during the power seizure from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in January, the "Work-Study Command Department" did not unite with the other revolutionary organizations. From then on, there were sharp contradictions between this organization and the other revolutionary organizations. The "Work-Study Command Department" believed that since their organization was the largest and had the greatest achievements, they naturally deserved to seize power. The other revolutionary organizations believed that after seizing power, the "Work-Study Command Department" had forgotten their comrades-in-arms and harbored "great power chauvinism," "cliquism," and "revolutionary exclusivism."

This struggle became very intense. Some organizations united with smaller revolutionary groups to counter-seize power from the "Work-Study Command Department." Others used the "general's method" to put the "Work-Study Command Department" in a passive position. At that time, the "Work-Study Command Department" feared losing the prestige of the power-seizers and dared not open the door to rectification, not daring to publicly criticize their own mistakes. The "East is Red Command Department" took the initiative to open the door to rectification, publicly criticizing their own shortcomings and errors, and inviting other revolutionary organizations to criticize them. The intention was to put the "Work-Study Command Department" in a passive position.

Thus, various revolutionary organizations ignored the capitalist-roaders within the party and were busy with "internal warfare." Some revolutionary organizations, even if they conducted a few criticisms, lacked the unified strength of the entire factory, resulting in weak momentum and little effect.

At this critical moment, a military representative from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army entered the factory. Seeing this situation, they proposed that the revolutionary organizations should sit down and solve problems through criticism and self-criticism, pointing out that "internal warfare" not only failed to resolve contradictions among the people but also could be exploited by class enemies, causing pain to friends and joy to enemies. Some organizations, upon hearing that a meeting would be held to solve problems, immediately formed an "investigation team" to specifically collect the shortcomings and errors of the other side and study countermeasures. They did not start from the desire for unity but aimed to strike down the other side with one blow.

Seeing these erroneous methods, the comrades from the People's Liberation Army helped them seriously study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," first solving the problem of starting from the desire for unity. This way, criticism would be beneficial to the unity of the proletariat rather than being used as a means to vent personal grievances and attack others. They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "Here, first of all, we must start from the desire for unity. Because if there is no subjective desire for unity, a struggle will inevitably make things chaotic and uncontrollable. Is that not 'ruthless struggle and merciless blows'? Where is the unity of the party?"

They studied and rectified themselves, thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois "self" and firmly establishing the proletarian "public." Various revolutionary organizations realized that what hindered them from correctly using the weapon of criticism and self-criticism was not a matter of method but a matter of worldview. Ultimately, it was a question of for whom to revolutionize and for whom to seize power. Standing on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, seizing power for the proletariat, would direct the gun at the capitalist-roaders in power, never focusing on competing for positions and power within one's own organization. A leader of one organization deeply felt: "If your head is filled with the word 'I,' you won't see the big picture and will inevitably say stupid things and do stupid things, ultimately helping the enemy and harming comrades."

During the study, the comrades from various revolutionary organizations, in the spirit of conducting more self-criticism, sincerely expressed their thoughts, openly revealing even the erroneous plans they had not yet executed. The comrades from the "East is Red Command Department" said: "Although we believe that the 'Work-Study Command Department' has the correct direction, we had reservations in our hearts. Therefore, we mistakenly thought that even if you seized power, if you combine with that cadre, we will struggle against that cadre and see what you can do about it."

The comrades from the "Work-Study Command Department" were deeply moved. Before the comrades from the "East is Red Command Department" finished speaking, they eagerly said: "The main mistakes are on our side. We are the organization in power, and our organization is the largest. We indeed committed the error of 'great power chauvinism.' This is mainly due to the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts of 'cliquism' and 'revolutionary exclusivism.' The comrades from the 'Work-Study Command Department' sincerely criticized the comrades from the 'East is Red Command Department.' They also criticized the comrades from the "August 1st Detachment," saying that because the "August 1st Detachment" gave us advice, we 'smashed' your organization. This was completely wrong, and even more wrong was labeling the "August 1st Detachment" giving us advice as a 'counterattack against the new regime,' thus pushing our comrades to the enemy's side.

The comrades from the "August 1st Detachment" also criticized themselves for not looking at the essence and mainstream of the "Work-Study Command Department" but focusing on individual shortcomings and errors, issuing a "notice" to the "Work-Study Command Department" today and a "protest" tomorrow, without directing the spearhead at the capitalist-roaders in power.

Through this study and this serious criticism and self-criticism, various revolutionary organizations, under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, found a common language. The entire factory achieved great unity from the bottom up by system and department, established a unified revolutionary organization, and elected a "three-in-one" provisional power structure for the entire factory. A high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works was launched throughout the factory, and at the same time, a high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation was launched.

　　青岛四方机车车辆厂各革命组织正确处理人民内部矛盾
　　多作自我批评促进革命大联合
　　全厂成立统一革命组织，选出“三结合”临时权力机构，集中力量开展革命大批判
    本报讯　青岛四方机车车辆厂的各革命组织，学习《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，运用团结——批评——团结的方法，认真地进行自我批评，解决了各革命组织之间长期存在的矛盾，在新的基础上达到了新的团结，实现了无产阶级革命派的大联合。
    这个工厂原有四个大的革命组织。在同资产阶级反动路线大搏斗中，最大的一个革命组织“工学指挥部”发挥了很大的作用。其他三个革命组织，也和“工学指挥部”实行有力的配合。但是，在一月份从厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手里夺权时，“工学指挥部”却没有和其他革命组织联合。从此，这个革命组织和其他革命组织之间就发生了尖锐的矛盾。“工学指挥部”认为自己的组织最大，战功也最大，自己掌权是理所当然的。其他革命组织认为“工学指挥部”夺权以后，忘了并肩作战的战友，有“大国沙文主义”“小团体主义”和“唯我革命”的思想。
    这场斗争曾经发展得很激烈。有的联合了一些小的革命组织向“工学指挥部”进行反夺权。有的用“将军”的方法来使“工学指挥部”被动。当时，“工学指挥部”怕失掉夺权者的威信，不敢开门整风，对自己的错误不敢公开检讨。“东方红指挥部”就偏偏开门整风，公开检讨自己的缺点错误，并要求各革命组织对自己提意见。用意是要使“工学指挥部”陷于被动地位。
    这样，各革命组织都丢开党内走资本主义道路当权派不管，忙于“内战”。有的革命组织，即使搞一两次批判，由于没有形成全厂统一的力量，声势不大，效果也不大。
    正在这个时候，人民解放军某部支援工业的军代表进了工厂。他们看到这种情况，就提出革命组织要坐下来，通过批评与自我批评来解决问题，指出打“内战”不但无助于解决人民内部矛盾，而且会被阶级敌人所利用，只能使亲者痛，仇者快。有的组织一听说要开会解决问题，就成立了“调查组”，专门搜集对方的缺点和错误，研究对策。不是从团结的愿望出发，而是要把别人一棍子打死。
    解放军的同志看到他们这些错误的作法，就帮助他们认真学习毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这一光辉著作，首先解决“从团结的愿望出发”这个出发点问题，使批评有利于无产阶级团结，而不是把批评作为泄私愤，攻击别人的手段。他们反复学习了毛主席这一段教导：“在这里，首先需要从团结的愿望出发。因为如果在主观上没有团结的愿望，一斗势必把事情斗乱，不可收拾，那还不是‘残酷斗争，无情打击’？那还有什么党的团结？”
    他们边学习边整风，大破资产阶级的私字，大立无产阶级的公字。各革命组织认识到，妨碍自己正确运用批评与自我批评这个武器的不是方法问题，而是世界观问题。说到底，是为谁革命，为谁夺权的问题。站在毛主席的革命路线上，为无产阶级夺权，就会把枪口对准走资本主义道路的当权派，而绝不会热中于为自己组织争地位，为自己组织争权。有一个组织的负责人深有感受地说：“脑袋里装着个我字，就看不到大方向，势必要说蠢话，办蠢事，结果帮助了敌人，伤害了同志。”
    在学习中，各革命组织的同志，本着多作自我批评的精神，诚恳地亮思想，把想做但还没有做的错误打算都统统亮了出来。“东方红指挥部”的同志说：“我们虽然认为‘工学指挥部’的大方向是正确的，但心里有意见，因此曾经错误地想过，别看你夺了权，你要结合那个干部，我们就斗那个干部，看你有什么办法。”
      “工学指挥部”的同志听了很感动，他们不等“东方红指挥部”的同志说完，就抢着说：主要错误在我们方面，我们是掌权的组织，组织又最大，确实犯了“大国沙文主义”的错误，这主要是“小团体主义”、“唯我革命”的资产阶级思想、小资产阶级思想作怪。“工学指挥部”的同志向“东方红指挥部”的同志作了诚恳的检讨。又向“八一支队”的同志检讨说，因为“八一支队”给我们提意见，所以就“砸”你们的组织，这完全是错误的，至于把“八一支队”给自己提意见说成是“向新政权反扑”更是错误的，这样就把自己的战友，推向了敌人方面去了。
      “八一支队”的同志也检讨了自己对“工学指挥部”不看本质和主流，而抓住个别缺点和错误不放，今天给“工学指挥部”来一个“照会”，明天又来一个“抗议”，没有把矛头对准走资本主义道路当权派。
    经过这次学习，经过这场严肃的批评与自我批评，各革命组织在毛泽东思想的旗帜下，有了共同的语言。全厂实现按系统、按部门自下而上的大联合，成立了统一的革命组织，选出全厂“三结合”临时权力机构。在全厂掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，同时也掀起了斗、批、改的高潮。
