The Voice of Indonesian Youth strongly condemns the atrocities committed by the reactionary government of Burma. The Ne Win fascist military clique's frenzied anti-Chinese campaign is a desperate last stand.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 26th, The Voice of Indonesian Youth published an editorial on July 10th, strongly condemning the anti-Chinese atrocities committed by the Ne Win fascist military regime. The editorial pointed out that the Ne Win reactionary government's continued anti-communist, anti-Chinese, and anti-people stance will not end well.

The editorial stated that the Ne Win fascist military government, in order to satisfy its masters—the U.S. imperialists supported by Soviet modern revisionists—has brutally persecuted the Chinese community in Burma, even going so far as to savagely murder Chinese experts.

The editorial said that before committing these crimes, the foreign minister of the Indonesian fascist military regime, Malik, held talks with the Ne Win fascist military regime in Burma. It is clear that this evil collusion, directed by Washington and Moscow, aims to launch a barbaric attack on the powerful world revolutionary base—the People's Republic of China—and to try to obstruct the armed struggle of the heroic Burmese people.

The editorial said that if the U.S. imperialists, Soviet modern revisionists, Ne Win fascist regime, and Suharto-Nasution fascist regime continue their anti-communist, anti-Chinese, and anti-people stance, they will not end well. This is the law of history.

The editorial said that the crimes committed by the Ne Win fascist military regime against the Chinese community and the brutal suppression of the Burmese people only indicate the sharpening of class contradictions within Burma and the final struggles of the Burmese reactionaries.

The editorial expressed the belief that the Chinese community in Burma, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will certainly be able to thwart the various plots of the Ne Win fascist regime to persecute them.

    《印尼青年之声》愤怒谴责缅甸反动政府的反华暴行
    奈温反动派疯狂反华是垂死挣扎
    据新华社二十六日讯  《印尼青年之声》七月十日发表社论，强烈谴责奈温法西斯军人政权的反华暴行。社论指出，奈温反动政府继续反共、反华、反人民，决没有好下场。
    社论说，奈温法西斯军人政府为了满足它的主子、得到苏联现代修正主义者支持的美帝国主义的愿望，残暴地迫害缅甸华侨，甚至疯狂地杀害中国专家。
    社论说，在犯下这些罪行之前，印尼法西斯军人政权的外交部长马利克同缅甸奈温法西斯军人政权举行了会谈。很明显，这场由华盛顿和莫斯科一手导演的罪恶勾结，是为了对强大的世界革命基地——中华人民共和国进行野蛮的攻击，并企图阻挡英雄的缅甸人民的武装斗争。
    社论说，美帝国主义者、苏联现代修正主义者、奈温法西斯政权和苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯政权如果继续反共、反华、反人民，决没有好下场。这是历史的规律。
    社论说，奈温法西斯军人政权对华侨犯下的罪行和对缅甸人民的残酷镇压，只能表明缅甸国内阶级矛盾的尖锐化，表明缅甸反动派的最后挣扎。
    社论表示相信，用毛泽东思想武装起来的缅甸华侨，一定能够挫败奈温法西斯政权的种种迫害他们的阴谋。
