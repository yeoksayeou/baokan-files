A group of Chinese sailors armed with Mao Zedong Thought underwent a severe test in the Bay of Biscay, France, in March, thousands of miles away from their homeland. They remembered Chairman Mao's instructions: "Resolutely fight for victory, overcome all difficulties, and never fear sacrifice." They embodied the spirit of "fearing neither hardship nor death" to serve the people of the world. They battled for two days and a night, turning the perilous "Nantong" cargo ship, which was then facing eleven-level winds and waves, into a safe vessel.

The "Nantong" cargo ship is the "Hezuo" cargo ship of the China-Tanzania Joint Shipping Company, which arrived at Huangpu Port on the 16th. It was purchased with Chinese loans and procured on the international market by China on behalf of Tanzania. This triumphant song of overcoming stormy waves with Mao Zedong Thought took place on this ship as it sailed from Northern Europe to Tanzania.

After the Chinese sailors took over the ship in Northern Europe, they were determined to hand over this first ocean-going cargo ship owned by Tanzania in the best possible condition to the Tanzanian people, as a gesture of support from the Chinese people. From the day they boarded the ship, they were busy with repairs and cleaning, without a moment's rest.

The cargo ship left the Northern European port on March 10 and encountered winds and waves ever since. At around 7 AM on the 12th, it entered the Bay of Biscay, known for its fierce winds and waves, earning the nickname "the jaws of death" in the international maritime community. Before the ship entered the bay, the wind was at level eight. After entering, the winds and waves grew increasingly stronger, reaching level eleven by the afternoon. Giant waves crashed one after another, each wave causing the entire ship to shake, with the bow rising and falling by seventy to eighty degrees. The ship's left and right tilt reached forty to forty-five degrees, and sometimes the ship's side was almost level with the sea surface. The waves not only rolled across the deck but also splashed onto the high bridge.

Many of the sailors, especially the new recruits, had been seasick for the past two days. Even the experienced sailors could not help but vomit. Some vomited seven or eight times, emptying their stomachs. Despite this, everyone firmly remembered the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings: "What is work? Work is struggle." "In times of difficulty, our comrades... must see the light and boost our morale." Although far from home and in an emergency situation, and later even the radio malfunctioned, losing contact, the comrades remained calm and optimistic, standing firm at their posts.

The helmsmen and sailors thought, "The safety of the entire ship is in our hands. No matter how strong the winds and waves are, or how difficult the operation is, we must firmly hold the steering wheel and maintain the course." The engineers thought, "The ship is newly acquired, and the condition of the machinery is not yet clear. In such strong winds and waves, the machinery must not fail," so they listened carefully to the sounds of various machines without stopping and conducted inspections continuously.

Around 7 PM in the evening, the cargo ship faced its most dangerous test. After a few giant waves hit, the ship shook violently for a while, and suddenly, a loud "thud" sounded in the cargo hold. "The cargo is moving!"

Those with sailing experience knew that in heavy winds and waves, cargo shifting in the hold would cause the ship's center of gravity to become unstable, leading to a capsizing accident. Moreover, among the cargo on the ship were some large steel pipes standing upright. After being tossed by the heavy waves, the steel ropes binding them had broken, and as the ship tilted left and right, they slammed against the ship's steel plates, one after another. These pipes were as thick as basins, with walls one to two inches thick, each weighing one to two tons. Their hardness exceeded that of the ship's steel plates, and if they continued to ram, the ship's bottom would soon be punctured.

In this critical situation, the Communist Party branch committee on the ship held a meeting and decided on emergency measures: "Turn around, secure the cargo." The crew unanimously supported this decision because without turning the ship's head, changing from sailing against the wind to sailing with the wind to reduce the ship's tossing, it would be impossible to secure the cargo. However, turning around in heavy winds and waves is very risky. If not careful, a wave could hit the ship's midsection and capsize it. Everyone remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "In strategy, we must despise all enemies; in tactics, we must take all enemies seriously." The captain calmly directed the turnaround, and the helmsman spiritedly and skillfully turned the wheel. When a wave came, the captain would shout, "Hold steady!" When the wave passed, the captain would shout, "Full rudder!" In this way, it took half an hour to successfully turn the ship around.

Then began another battle—securing the cargo below deck. Although the ship's tossing and tilting had slightly decreased by then, this work was still very dangerous. The heavy steel pipes were still rolling back and forth in the hold, colliding. Anyone below deck who did not dodge in time could be struck at any moment. However, the Chinese sailors, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, had the greatest courage. Although securing cargo is usually the responsibility of the deck department, this time, even the fifty-plus-year-old chief engineer and non-duty personnel from the engine department, as well as staff from the administrative department, came to support. The captain and the political commissar, who had not had a good rest for two or three days since the ship's departure, also immediately rushed to this most dangerous and critical post to secure the cargo with everyone else. Everyone sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, encouraging each other with Chairman Mao's teachings of "displaying courage in battle, fearing neither sacrifice nor fatigue, and fighting continuously (i.e., fighting several battles in a short period without rest)." In this way, from 9 PM on the 12th to around 8 or 9 AM on the 13th, they battled for about twelve hours, securing the cargo. Despite being exhausted, the cargo ship turned from danger to safety.

Reflecting on this great struggle against the storm, the officers and crew on the ship unanimously said, "Mao Zedong Thought gave us the greatest courage." "Where did we get our strength? From Chairman Mao's teachings."

One sailor said well, "After studying Chairman Mao's thoughts, we never get lost at any time and can complete the mission. No matter how strong the winds and waves are, or how many days and nights we go without eating or sleeping, we still revolutionize."

    一曲依靠毛泽东思想战胜惊涛骇浪的凯歌
    我国海员苦战两天一夜使遇险的坦桑尼亚货轮转危为安
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国的一批海员三月间在远离祖国万里的法国比斯开湾经受了一次严峻的考验，他们牢记毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”，发扬“一不怕苦，二不怕死”的为世界人民服务的精神，苦战两天一夜，使当时遇到十一级大风浪的“南通号”货轮转危为安。
    这艘“南通号”货轮就是十六日到达黄埔港的中国—坦桑尼亚联合海运公司的坦桑尼亚货轮“合作号”。它是由中国贷款和由中国代为在国际市场上购买的。这一曲依靠毛泽东思想战胜惊涛骇浪的凯歌，就发生在这艘货轮从北欧驶往坦桑尼亚的途中。
    中国海员在北欧接收这艘货轮以后，他们就决心把这艘坦桑尼亚自己拥有的第一艘远洋货轮，在最好的状态下交到坦桑尼亚人民手里，作为中国人民对坦桑尼亚人民的支援。他们上船的第一天起就忙着检修，洗刷，一刻也没有停过。
    货船三月十日从北欧港口开出以后，就一直遇到风浪，十二日上午七时左右进入法国比斯开湾。比斯开湾素以风浪大著名，在国际航海界有着“虎口”之类的称号。在这艘船进入比斯开湾以前，风力是八级，进入以后，风浪越来越大，到了下午增强到十一级。这时，山一般的大浪一个接一个地扑来，每一个大浪打过，全船震动，船头上下摆动达到七、八十度，船身的左右倾侧到了四十——四十五度，有时船舷甚至同海面快要相平，浪水不仅在甲板上滚流，而且打上了高处的驾驶台。
    船员中不少新海员，前两天就开始晕船。即便是老海员，在这种风浪下也禁不住呕吐起来。有的人吐了七八次，胃里都吐空了。在这种情况下，大家牢牢记着伟大的领袖毛主席的教导：“什么叫工作，工作就是斗争。”“我们的同志在困难的时候，……要看到光明，要提高我们的勇气。”尽管远离祖国，情况紧急，后来甚至无线电也发生了故障，失去联络，同志们仍然是镇定乐观，坚守岗位。
    驾驶员和水手想到，全船安危操在自己手中，那怕风浪再大，操作再困难，也牢牢把住舵轮，掌握住航向。轮机员们想到，船是新接收的，机器状况还未摸清，在这种大风浪下机器千万出不得故障，因此一刻也不停地仔细听着各种机器的声响，不断进行检查。
    到傍晚七时左右，货船遭遇了最危险的考验。接连几个大浪打过，船身猛烈摇晃了一阵，在货舱里忽然发生了“通通”的巨大声响。“货动了！”
    有航海经验的人知道，在大风浪中，装在船舱里的货物活动起来，就会使船体重心不稳而造成翻船事故。何况，在船上载运的货物中有一些竖着安放的、粗大的钢管，经过大风浪不住的颠簸，已经挣断了捆绑的钢缆，并且随着船身的左右倾侧，向着船体两侧的钢板，一下又一下地冲击起来。这些钢管有脸盆般粗，管壁厚达一两寸，每个有一两吨重，它们的硬度超过了船舱钢板，这样冲撞下去，要不了多久，船底就会洞穿。
    在这紧急的情况下，船上的中共党支部委员会召开了会议，决定了紧急措施：“掉头，绑货”，船员们一致拥护这个决定，因为不掉转船头，由逆风行驶改为顺风行驶，使船体的颠簸减轻，是无法捆绑货物的。但是，在大风浪中掉头是要冒很大风险的，在掉头时一不小心，让大浪拦腰一压，就可能翻船。大家都记住毛主席的教导：“在战略上我们要藐视一切敌人，在战术上我们要重视一切敌人。”船长沉着地指挥掉头，舵手精神抖擞，转舵动作利落。一个大浪打过来，船长就叫：“把住！”大浪过去了，船长就叫：“满舵！”这样，花了半小时，终于顺利地掉转了船头。
    于是开始了另一个战役——下舱绑货。尽管这时船的颠簸和倾侧已经稍稍减轻，这一工作仍然是很危险的，沉重的钢管仍在舱中来回滚动，冲撞。下舱的人如果躲避不及，随时都有被冲着的危险。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国海员，具有最大的勇气。尽管绑货工作在平时是属于甲板部人员的工作范围，但是这一次五十多岁的轮机长和轮机部不值班的人员、事务部门的人员都来支援了。船长和政委从轮船开航以来已经两三天没有很好休息，这时也马上赶到这一最危险，最关键的岗位，同大家一起捆货。大家高唱毛主席语录歌，用毛主席教导的“发扬勇敢战斗、不怕牺牲、不怕疲劳和连续作战（即在短期内不休息地接连打几仗）的作风”互相勉励。就这样，从十二日晚九时一直到十三日上午八、九时，连续苦战了十二小时左右，把货初步捆绑好。尽管大家累得精疲力尽，货船转危为安了。
    在回顾这场同暴风的大搏斗时，船上的干部和船员一致地说：“毛泽东思想给了我们最大的勇气。”“我们哪里来的劲头？来自毛主席的教导。”
    一个船员说得好：“学习了毛主席思想，任何时候不迷路，能完成任务。不管风多大，浪多大，几天几夜不吃不睡，照样革命。”
