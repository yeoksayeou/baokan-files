Their banner is very clear.

The People's Liberation Army arrived at our workshop and immediately took a clear and unyielding stand on the side of the revolutionary faction, helping us firmly grasp the direction of the struggle.

After achieving revolutionary unity in the workshop, the comrades from the People's Liberation Army timely pointed out to us that we must "overthrow the 'private' character and establish the 'public' character," uniting all forces that can be united to jointly confront the enemy.

They set an example by leading the way, conducting thorough and detailed ideological work with comrades who had been misled. In the early stages of the movement, one comrade did not recognize the direction of the revolution and made some mistakes. The comrades from the People's Liberation Army took the initiative to have a heart-to-heart talk with him. This comrade recognized the reasons for being misled by the bourgeois reactionary line, and after two days of intense ideological struggle, voluntarily withdrew from the conservative organization and joined the workshop's frontline command department. This specific example educated many comrades in the workshop who had been misled, and they all returned to the revolutionary fold, resolutely requesting to join the revolutionary organization.

Recently, the comrades from the People's Liberation Army have also helped our workshop carry out a revolutionary big criticism. The comrades from the People's Liberation Army are so loyal in executing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They are forever our models to learn from.

    他们的旗帜非常鲜明
    解放军刚到我们车间，就旗帜鲜明地、坚定不移地站在革命派一边，帮助我们牢牢掌握斗争大方向。
    在车间实现革命大联合后，解放军同志又及时向我们指出，要“打倒‘私’字，树立‘公’字”，团结一切可以团结的力量，共同对敌。
    他们以身作则，对受蒙蔽的同志深入细致地做思想工作。有一个同志在运动初期，认不清革命的大方向，做错了一些事。解放军同志主动找他谈心。这个同志认识了自己受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的原因，经过两天激烈的思想斗争，自觉地退出了保守组织，参加了车间前线指挥部。这一具体事例，教育了车间很多受蒙蔽的同志，他们纷纷大杀回马枪，坚决要求参加革命组织。
    最近，解放军同志又帮助我们车间开展了革命的大批判。解放军同志这样忠诚地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，他们永远是我们无产阶级革命派学习的榜样。
