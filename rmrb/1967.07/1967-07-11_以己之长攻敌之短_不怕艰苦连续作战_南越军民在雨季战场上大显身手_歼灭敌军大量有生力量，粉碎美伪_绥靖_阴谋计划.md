South Vietnamese military and civilians around Saigon and in the Mekong Delta region have bravely fought through the rainy season, continuously engaging the enemy and inflicting heavy losses. In June, they annihilated a large number of enemy forces, thwarting the American and puppet "pacification" schemes, making the American and puppet forces even more passive and disorganized.

According to the Vietnam South Liberation Communication Agency, the American and puppet forces have recently conducted "pacification" sweeps around Saigon, repeatedly suffering heavy blows from local military and civilians. In Ba Dia Province, the military and civilians of Chau Doc County launched a fierce attack on enemy forces in several communes west of Highway 2 from June 9 to 18, eliminating over 600 American and puppet soldiers and Australian mercenaries, and destroying 33 armored vehicles.

On June 17, the liberation forces in Tuyen Duc Province successfully annihilated an entire camp of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division and severely damaged another camp. Local guerrilla forces also closely cooperated with the main forces, counterattacking enemy sweeps. In Bien Hoa Province, the guerrilla forces in Thanh Khe Commune, from June 12 to 25, destroyed or damaged 23 American tanks and armored vehicles, shot down one plane, and eliminated most of the enemy on military vehicles.

In Dinh Tuong Province, the guerrilla forces in De Hoa, Ben Luc, and Tan Phuoc Counties, from June 2 to 13, eliminated 204 American and puppet soldiers, shot down five enemy planes, and destroyed two armored vehicles during anti-sweep battles. The liberation forces in Gia Dinh and Dinh Tuong Provinces, from June 18 to 21, continuously ambushed American and puppet forces heading to several communes at the provincial border, foiling the enemy's pacification schemes. They killed or wounded over 600 enemy soldiers, most of whom were American invaders, shot down four helicopters and one reconnaissance plane, sank four warships, and damaged one.

On June 27, the liberation forces in Bien Hoa Province attacked a puppet 52nd Special Forces camp that had just been air-dropped into the Ba Tong area in the northeast of the province. Preliminary reports indicate that two enemy companies were annihilated and another was severely damaged.

In the Mekong Delta region, the liberation forces have been even more active on the rainy season battlefield, frequently attacking the enemy and setting traps everywhere.

In the Tan My Chanh area, the liberation forces, on the night of June 4 and the early morning of June 5, attacked the puppet military base in Ka Do, annihilating two puppet special forces companies, killing or wounding 150 enemy soldiers, and capturing many. On the night of June 4, the liberation forces also attacked the enemy's artillery positions and logistics base in Thu Thua County, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy.

From June 9 to 16, the guerrilla forces in Chau Doc, Tan Phu, and Hiep Hoa in Vinh Long Province continuously and proactively surrounded and attacked the enemy, eliminating 208 enemy soldiers, sinking or damaging five warships. The guerrilla forces in Tan Phu and Hiep Hoa's Fifth Village destroyed 11 enemy planes and damaged four military vehicles during this period. On the night of June 10, the liberation forces also bombarded Vinh Long Airport for the seventh time.

On the night of June 13 and the early morning of June 14, the local forces in Chuong Thien Province attacked puppet forces heading to "pacify" near Cho Lon County, killing or wounding 133 enemy soldiers, annihilating one puppet company, and severely damaging one "pacification" squad.

On June 7, the guerrilla forces in Chau Doc County in My Tho Province ambushed and sank an enemy ship full of soldiers on the river, annihilating all on board. On the same day, the guerrilla forces in Hiep Hoa County also ambushed an enemy convoy on the river, sinking or damaging three ships. On June 28, the guerrilla forces and local troops again ambushed enemy forces sweeping through Hiep Hoa County, annihilating two puppet special forces companies and severely damaging one.

On June 15, the liberation forces in My Tho Province attacked the command post of the puppet 31st Regiment's 1st Battalion stationed in Vi Thanh City, killing or wounding over 100 enemy soldiers, and blowing up many buildings and warehouses.

On the South Vietnamese battlefield, the American invaders have been beaten to a pulp by the people's armed forces. Look at the pathetic state of the American devils. (Photo transmitted by Xinhua News Agency)
