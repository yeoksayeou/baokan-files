The recent "High Hold the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought, Study and Apply Chairman Mao's Works Actively, Coal-Saving Experience Exchange Conference" was held in Tianjin. Revolutionary boiler workers, revolutionary technicians, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary pioneers and coal-saving champions from various industries in Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin participated. They issued an open letter on the issue of coal-saving, advocating for a broad and in-depth mass movement to save coal in accordance with the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings of "grasp revolution, promote production" and "save to make a revolution."

The letter states that coal is an important resource for national production and construction, the "grain" of industry, and an indispensable necessity in people's lives. Saving coal is an important measure to implement "prepare for war, prepare for famine, serve the people" and is a long-term and extremely important political task. We, the revolutionary cadres of the coal-saving front in Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin, have discussed the great political significance of saving coal. We firmly stand with revolutionary comrades from all departments, units, industries, and fronts across the country, shoulder to shoulder, closely united, and rapidly push coal-saving work to a new stage.

The letter emphasizes that to do a good job in coal-saving, we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, highlight proletarian politics, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, and arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought. Thrift and waste are reflections of the struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads, and are fundamental opposites of the proletarian and bourgeois worldviews. We proletarian revolutionaries, having taken power, should even more maintain the fine tradition of hard work and thrift, always, everywhere, and in everything, plan carefully and practice thrift, strongly oppose the capitalist line of economic construction, strongly oppose counter-revolutionary economism, strongly oppose waste, and propagate the great significance of saving coal to every household and individual. Fully mobilize the masses, respect the masses' initiative, and let the broad revolutionary masses use the boundless revolutionary enthusiasm released in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to grasp revolution, promote production, and save coal. With the revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," launch a new high tide in coal-saving work and carry it out thoroughly and persistently.

Beijing, Shanghai, and Tianjin are cities with relatively large coal consumption. After taking power, many factories, enterprises, and coal-using units of the proletarian revolutionaries have, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teaching of "save to make a revolution," created many advanced experiences of saving coal with little investment, quick results, significant effects, and low consumption. At this conference, 20 factories, hospitals, and other units from the three cities introduced their typical experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, promoting the thought revolution of the people, and saving coal. The common feature of these experiences is that revolutionary workers, guided by the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, and carry forward the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, dare to do, dare to venture, and dare to innovate. They have strongly opposed foreign equipment and old frameworks, strongly opposed the capitalist roaders in power within the party and reactionary technical authorities, broken down bourgeois ideology, broken down the material incentives, money-first, reliance on foreign crutches, and expert line of revisionism in the past coal-saving work, and established Mao Zedong Thought. They have insisted on political leadership, self-reliance, and mobilizing the masses to blaze a trail of saving coal that is more, faster, better, and cheaper, raising the work of saving coal, which has great political significance, to a new level.

Many experiences introduced at the conference show that the potential for saving coal is great, and doing a good job in coal-saving is of great significance in ensuring the completion of the year's production plan. Some factories' proletarian revolutionaries said in their sharing that in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we revolutionaries have a deeper understanding that thrift is the nature of the proletariat, and saving coal is a big deal related to the revolution. As long as we are guided by Mao Zedong Thought, the path of saving coal is very broad, and the potential is very great. To achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and to promote new developments in production, we must make greater contributions in coal-saving work.

    北京上海天津节煤经验交流大会倡议节约闹革命
    发动群众　节约煤炭
    不少工厂企业创造了许多花钱少见效快效果大的节煤经验
    新华社天津十二日电　最近，北京、上海、天津的革命司炉工人、革命的技术人员、革命干部和各行各业的革命闯将、节煤标兵，在天津召开了“高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，节约煤炭经验交流大会”。他们就节约煤炭问题发出的公开信，倡议按照伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”、“要节约闹革命”的教导，立即掀起一个广泛深入的群众性的节约煤炭新高潮。
    信中说，煤炭是国家生产建设中的重要物资，是工业的“粮食”，也是人民生活中不可缺少的必需品。节约煤炭是贯彻“备战、备荒、为人民”的重要措施之一，是一项长期的极为重要的政治任务。我们北京、上海、天津三市节煤战线上的无产阶级革命派，讨论了节约煤炭的重大政治意义，我们坚决与全国各部门、各单位、各行业、各个战线上的无产阶级革命派战友们一道，并肩作战，紧密团结在一起，把节煤工作迅速推向一个新阶段。
    信中强调指出，要搞好节煤工作，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑。勤俭节约和铺张浪费，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的一种反映，是无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观根本对立的表现。我们无产阶级革命派掌了权，更应该保持艰苦朴素、勤俭节约的优良传统，时时、事事、处处精打细算、厉行节约，大造经济建设方面的资产阶级反动路线的反，大造反革命经济主义的反，大造铺张浪费的反，把节约煤炭的重大意义宣传到家喻户晓，人人皆知，充分发动群众，尊重群众的首创精神，使广大革命群众把在无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天革命干劲，用于狠抓革命，猛促生产，大搞节煤，以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，掀起节煤工作的新高潮，并把它扎扎实实、深入持久地开展下去。
    北京、上海、天津都是用煤量比较大的城市，不少工厂企业和用煤单位的无产阶级革命派在掌权以后，遵照毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大教导，创造了许多花钱少、见效快、效果大、消耗低的节约煤炭的先进经验。在这次会上，就有三个城市的二十个工厂、医院等单位介绍了他们活学活用毛主席著作、促进人的思想革命化、搞好节煤的典型经验。这些经验的共同特点是，革命职工用战无不胜的毛泽东思想作指导，活学活用毛主席著作，发扬敢想、敢干、敢闯、敢创的革命精神，大造了洋设备、旧框框的反，大造了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和反动技术权威的反，大破资产阶级思想，大破过去在节约工作中的物质刺激、钞票挂帅、依靠洋拐棍、走专家路线的修正主义框框，大立毛泽东思想，坚持政治挂帅、自力更生、放手发动群众，闯出了一条多快好省的节煤路子，把节约煤炭这样一项具有重大政治意义的工作提到了一个新的水平。
    会上介绍的很多经验表明，节约煤炭的潜力是很大的，做好节煤工作，对于保证胜利完成全年的生产计划有着重要的意义。一些工厂的无产阶级革命派在介绍他们的体会时说，在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们革命派更深刻地懂得了勤俭节约是无产阶级的本色，节约煤炭是关系到革命的大事情，只要我们用毛泽东思想作指导，节煤的路子是很宽的，潜力是很大的。为了夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，为了促进生产的新发展，我们一定要在节煤工作中做出更大的贡献。
