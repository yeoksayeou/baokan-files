	Editor's Note: How should revolutionary mass organizations handle disagreements?

	The correct approach is to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and for both sides to engage in serious self-criticism.

	The proletarian revolutionaries of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have done this and achieved good results. They have eliminated the estrangement and antagonism between various revolutionary organizations and have realized a revolutionary unity from the bottom up according to administrative systems.

	Chairman Mao has said that one of the three major characteristics of our Communist Party is self-criticism. Now, in identifying whether a person or an organization is a genuine proletarian revolutionary, an important criterion is whether they engage in serious self-criticism.

	Self-criticism is self-revolution. If one only sees the faults of others and not one's own, if one is a rebel towards others but a liberal towards oneself, and does not rebel against one's own non-proletarian thoughts, such a person cannot be considered a genuine proletarian revolutionary.

	In handling the relationships between mass organizations, there is an extremely erroneous approach: to beat, smash, loot, search, and arrest, attempting to subdue others by force and suppress them by power. This approach not only fails to solve any problem but also makes one increasingly deviate from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and stray from the correct track of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Each of us should reflect on what can be done and should be done during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and what cannot be done and should not be done. We must always adhere to Chairman Mao's principles on correctly handling contradictions among the people, insist on the correct approach, and oppose the wrong approach.

	According to a report from our newspaper, the proletarian revolutionaries from over fifty units of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing area) have followed Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people. They have used the formula of "unity-criticism-unity" to correctly handle contradictions between revolutionary organizations. They have further realized revolutionary unity from the bottom up according to administrative units and have strengthened and improved the unified Revolutionary Rebel Committee for Seizing Power of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Now, more than twenty thousand revolutionary masses across the academy are, under the leadership of the Revolutionary Rebel Committee for Seizing Power, concentrating their firepower on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, combining the great criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units. They have launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the great criticism.

	The proletarian revolutionaries of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have emerged from the white terror created by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they have used their revolutionary strength to expose the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within their own organs and seized their power. They have always fought side by side, established deep class feelings, and their direction of struggle is consistent. However, at the critical moment of seizing power, the largest revolutionary organization in the academy—the Revolutionary Rebel Corps—and several organizations that split from this corps, such as the Red Flag Liaison Station, had serious disagreements, and both sides engaged in an "internal war."

	The comrades of the Red Flag Liaison Station believed that the leadership of the Revolutionary Rebel Corps was "rightist deviationist" and could not carry the revolution to the end. They said, "The class line in the academy is not clear," and proposed to have a "great debate" to "debate out a leftist leadership core."

	The Revolutionary Rebel Corps immediately "counterattacked." They believed that the other side was influenced by "Trotskyite" ideas and was "leftist opportunism," even proposing to "arrest a handful" and held a criticism meeting for this purpose.

	The "internal war" between the revolutionary organizations lasted for more than twenty days, deviating from the direction of the struggle.

	At this critical moment, the great leader Chairman Mao forwarded the big-character poster by the revolutionary youngsters of the Lu Xun Corps in Shanghai on conducting rectification, pointing out the direction for the proletarian revolutionaries of the academy. They issued calls to "stop the internal war and open the door for rectification." The leaders of various revolutionary organizations accepted the opinions of the broad masses of fighters, sat down to seriously study Chairman Mao's works, and conducted open rectification.

	They repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant works "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and "On Rectifying Errors in the Party," clearly recognizing that the contradictions between revolutionary organizations belong to contradictions among the people. Chairman Mao teaches us: "All contradictions among the people should be resolved by democratic methods, by the method of discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education, and not by coercion or suppression."

	Chairman Mao also said: "To resolve contradictions among the people, one cannot use curses, nor can one use fists, let alone guns; one can only use the method of discussion, reasoning, criticism, and self-criticism."

	The great thought of Mao Zedong has armed the proletarian revolutionaries of the academy. The leaders of various revolutionary organizations followed the great leader's teachings, conducted serious self-criticism, and conducted joint rectification on the basis of their own rectification.

	At a full-academy revolutionary mass meeting, the leaders of the Revolutionary Rebel Corps, the Red Flag Liaison Station, and other revolutionary organizations made sincere self-criticisms.

	The leaders of the Revolutionary Rebel Corps examined themselves for confusing two types of different contradictions, lacking class feelings for comrades who had fought together, lacking the desire for unity and the spirit of self-criticism, and wanting to subdue others by force and suppress them by power because the Revolutionary Rebel Corps had more people and influence. They proposed inappropriate slogans and took excessive actions, intending to overthrow the other side. They also examined themselves for the fundamental reason for their mistakes: not closely following Chairman Mao and the Central Committee, with the "self" character in their minds.

	The leaders of the Red Flag Liaison Station examined themselves for reversing the nature of contradictions, elevating secondary contradictions to primary ones; for having sectarianism and the desire for fame, and the idea of "only I am revolutionary."

	After both sides conducted serious self-criticism, the estrangement and antagonism between various revolutionary organizations began to dissipate, and everyone had the desire for unity and a common goal of struggle. On the basis of Mao Zedong Thought and under the consistent goal of uniting against the enemy, over fifty units of the academy further realized the great unity of the revolutionaries.

	Recently, the proletarian revolutionaries of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have restudied Chairman Mao's epoch-making masterpiece "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and the May 16, 1966, notice of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, summing up the experience of a year of struggle. They deeply felt:

	First, the leaders of revolutionary organizations must take the lead in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, dare to reveal their thoughts, dare to take the lead in making self-criticisms that touch the soul and eliminate private interests to establish public interests, and humbly accept different opinions. Only in this way can they rectify the thoughts and styles of the revolutionary ranks and correctly resolve contradictions between revolutionary organizations, achieving new unity on a new basis.

	Second, proletarian revolutionaries can only truly unite the majority by seriously conducting self-criticism. If one always thinks that one is "one hundred percent correct" and the other side is "one hundred percent wrong," and even tries to subdue others by force and suppress them by power, then it is inevitable that the great unity of revolutionaries cannot be achieved. Only by following Chairman Mao's formula of unity-criticism-unity, especially by grasping self-criticism, can the non-proletarian thoughts of both sides be reduced, contradictions be narrowed, and the common language of Mao Zedong Thought be increased, thus laying the foundation for unity. Therefore, conducting serious self-criticism is the only correct method to resolve contradictions between and within revolutionary organizations.

	Third, various revolutionary organizations, on the basis of self-criticism, must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, further strengthen and consolidate the great unity of revolutionaries in the great criticism and in the struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within their own units. Proletarian revolutionaries must cherish and jointly protect this great unity. They must not do things that are not conducive to unity and not say things that are not conducive to unity. Both sides should seek common ground while reserving differences, forming a mighty revolutionary army to fight against the enemy.

	Fourth, after achieving the great unity of revolutionaries, there are still contradictions among proletarian revolutionaries, which is a normal phenomenon. The leaders of revolutionary organizations should not avoid these contradictions but should face them, using the method of frequent self-criticism, democratic discussion, and persuasion and education to correctly handle these contradictions. After proletarian revolutionaries seize power, their positions change, and they must be good at listening to different opinions, good at uniting those who have different opinions from themselves, and good at uniting those who have opposed themselves and have been proven by practice to have made mistakes. After achieving revolutionary unity, proletarian revolutionaries in the Chinese Academy of Sciences still had disagreements on some issues. This time, everyone learned from the lessons of the previous "internal war," became a bit wiser, and firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, closely following Chairman Mao and the Central Committee. The Seizing Power Committee of the academy called on all proletarian revolutionaries in the academy to strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, continually seize the power of the "self" character in their minds. This has formed a strong public opinion in the academy: "There are disagreements, but division is not allowed. There are debates, but internal wars are not allowed." For normal disagreements, efforts are made to promote proletarian democracy to seek solutions.

    科学院五十多个单位的革命组织正确处理人民内部矛盾
    多作自我批评团结群众大多数
    巩固左派核心实现革命大联合
    编者按：革命的群众组织之间发生分歧怎么办？
    正确的做法，就是要遵循毛主席的教导，双方认真地进行自我批评。
    中国科学院的无产阶级革命派这样做了，取得了很好的效果，消除了各革命组织之间的隔阂和对立情绪，并且实现了自下
  而上按行政系统的革命的大联合。
    毛主席说过，我们共产党的三大标志之一就是自我批评。现在，鉴别一个人、一个组织是不是真正的无产阶级革命派，一个很重要的标准，就是看他有没有认真的自我批评。
    自我批评，就是自我革命。如果光看见别人有毛病，看不到自己的毛病，对别人是造反派，对自己是自由主义，不造自己的非无产阶级思想的反，这种人，就不能算做真正的无产阶级革命派。
    在处理群众组织相互关系上，有一种极端错误的做法，就是打、砸、抢、抄、抓，企图以力服人，以势压人。这种做法，不仅根本无助于解决任何一个问题，而且使自己越来越背离毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，离开无产阶级文化大革命的正确轨道。
    我们每个同志都要想一想，在无产阶级文化大革命中，那些是可以做的，应当做的，那些是不可以做的，不应当做的。我们要始终遵循毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的原则，坚持正确的做法，反对错误的做法。
    本报讯　中国科学院（京区）的五十多个单位的无产阶级革命派，遵循毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导，运用“团结——批评——团结”的公式，正确地处理了革命组织之间的矛盾，进一步实现了自下而上按行政单位的革命的大联合，充实和健全了统一的中国科学院革命造反派联合夺权委员会。现在，全院二万多革命群众，正在联合夺权委员会的领导下，集中火力向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，把革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改结合起来，在革命的大批判中掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。
    中国科学院的无产阶级革命派，是从科学院党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派一手制造的白色恐怖下冲杀出来的。他们在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，用自己革命的力量把本机关内部党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揪了出来，夺了他们的权。他们一直并肩作战，建立了深厚的阶级感情，斗争的大方向是一致的。但是，在夺权斗争的关键时刻，科学院最大的革命组织——革命造反团和从这个组织中分出去的红旗联络站等几个组织之间，却发生了严重的分歧，双方进行了一场“内战”。
    红旗联络站的同志认为，造反团领导“右倾”，不能把革命进行到底。他们说，“科学院的阶级阵线不分明”，应该进行一场“大辩论”，“辩论出一个左派的领导核心”。
    造反团当即予以“反击”。他们认为，对方是“托派”思潮，是“左倾机会主义”，甚至提出要“抓一小撮”，并为此召开了批判大会。
    革命组织之间的“内战”激烈地进行了二十多天，背离了斗争的大方向。
    正在这个关头，伟大领袖毛主席批转了上海鲁迅兵团革命小将关于开展整风的大字报，给科学院的无产阶级革命派指明了前进的方向。他们纷纷发出“停止内战、开门整风”的呼吁。各革命组织的负责人接受了广大战士的意见，坐下来认真学习毛主席著作，开门整风。
    他们反复学习了毛主席的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，明确认识到革命组织之间的矛盾属于人民内部矛盾。毛主席教导我们：“凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。”
    毛主席又说：“解决人民内部矛盾，不能用咒骂，也不能用拳头，更不能用刀枪，只能用讨论的方法，说理的方法，批评和自我批评的方法。”
    伟大的毛泽东思想，武装了科学院的无产阶级革命派。各革命组织的负责人遵循伟大领袖的教导，认真地进行了自我批评，在各自整风的基础上，他们进行了联合整风。
    在全院革命群众大会上，造反团、红旗联络站和其他革命组织负责人，分别作了诚恳的自我批评。
    造反团的负责人检查了自己混淆了两类不同性质的矛盾，对共同战斗过的阶级兄弟缺乏阶级感情，缺乏团结的愿望和自我批评精神，以造反团人多势众，想以力服人，以势压人，提出不适当的口号，采取过火的行动，想把对方整垮。他们还检查了自己犯错误的根本原因是没有紧跟毛主席，没有紧跟党中央，头脑中的“私”字在作怪。
    红旗联络站的负责人检查了自己把矛盾的性质搞颠倒了，把次要矛盾上升为主要矛盾；自己有小团体主义、风头主义，有“唯我革命”的思想。
    在双方进行了认真的自我批评以后，各革命组织之间的隔阂和对立开始消除，大家有了团结的愿望和共同的斗争目标。在毛泽东思想的基础上，在团结对敌的一致目标下，科学院五十多个单位进一步实现了革命派的大联合。
    最近，中国科学院的无产阶级革命派重新学习了毛主席的划时代的天才著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和中共中央一九六六年五月十六日的《通知》，总结了一年的斗争经验。他们深深体会到：
    一、革命组织的负责人要带头活学活用毛主席著作，敢于亮思想，敢于带头作触及灵魂、破私立公的自我批评，虚心听取不同意见，这样才能整顿好革命队伍的思想、作风，才能正确解决革命组织之间的矛盾，在新的基础上达到新的团结。
    二、无产阶级革命派只有认真进行自我批评，才能真正团结大多数。如果总是认为自己是“百分之百的正确”，对方是“百分之百的错误”，而且把对方的问题“无限上纲”，甚至企图以力服人，以势压人，那就必然不能实现革命派的大联合。只有按照毛主席团结——批评——团结的公式，特别抓紧自我批评这一环，双方非无产阶级的思想少了，分歧缩小了，毛泽东思想的共同语言增多了，就有了团结的基础。因此，认真进行自我批评是解决革命组织之间和革命组织内部矛盾的唯一正确的方法。
    三、各革命组织在自我批评的基础上，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，在革命的大批判中，在对本单位党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，进一步加强和巩固革命派的大联合。无产阶级革命派一定要珍惜和共同爱护这种大联合。要做到不利于团结的事不作，不利于团结的话不说，双方求大同，存小异，组成一支浩浩荡荡的革命大军，对敌作战。
    四、在实现革命派大联合以后，无产阶级革命派之间还依然有矛盾，这是正常的现象。革命组织的负责人不应当回避这些矛盾，应当正视这些矛盾，用经常进行自我批评的方法，民主讨论的方法，说服教育的方法，正确处理这些矛盾。无产阶级革命派在掌权以后，地位起了变化，要善于听取不同意见，要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人。中国科学院在实现了革命的大联合以后，无产阶级革命派之间在一些问题上又发生了争论。这一次大家吸取了上次打“内战”的教训，都学得聪明一点了，坚决掌握了斗争的大方向，紧跟毛主席，紧跟党中央。院夺权委员会号召全院无产阶级革命派，努力活学活用毛主席著作，不断地夺自己头脑中“私”字的权。这就使得科学院形成了一种强大的舆论：“有分歧，不允许分裂。有争论，不许打内战。”对于正常的分歧意见，力求发扬无产阶级民主求得解决。
