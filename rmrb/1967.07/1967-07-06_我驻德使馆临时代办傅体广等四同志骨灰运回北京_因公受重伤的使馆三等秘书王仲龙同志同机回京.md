The remains of Comrade Fu Tiguang, Acting Head of our Embassy in the German Democratic Republic, and three other comrades—Comrade Yang Xianwen, an attaché; Comrade Cheng Xinquan, an embassy staff member; and Comrade Huang Xiaokang, an embassy staff member—who sacrificed their lives in the line of duty, were flown back to Beijing this afternoon. Comrade Wang Zhonglong, Third Secretary of our Embassy in the German Democratic Republic, who was severely injured in the line of duty, returned to the capital on the same flight.

At around 6 PM, Comrade Wang Zhonglong, lying on a stretcher and holding a portrait of Chairman Mao in both hands, was carried off the plane by medical personnel. Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi and other comrades who came to welcome him stepped forward to shake hands with Comrade Wang Zhonglong, expressing their warm greetings. Hundreds of revolutionary masses who came to welcome him read quotations from Chairman Mao, and representatives of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat presented Comrade Wang Zhonglong with Chairman Mao badges and the Little Red Book. Subsequently, the family members of Comrades Fu Tiguang and the other three martyrs, carrying the portraits and urns of the four comrades, walked off the plane. Comrade Chen Yi expressed deep condolences to the families of the four martyrs. The families of Comrades Fu Tiguang and the other three martyrs, along with the revolutionary masses, studied quotations from Chairman Mao.

Today, those who went to the airport to welcome the return included Luo Guibo, Zhou Yiping, Zhou Huamin, Li Qingquan, and other relevant officials, as well as Zhang Haifeng, our Ambassador to the German Democratic Republic.
