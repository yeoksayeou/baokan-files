Harbin middle school teachers and students held a rally to resume classes and make revolution, vowing to launch a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

A report from the Xinhua News Agency in Harbin on the 14th: On the 13th, revolutionary teachers and students from middle schools in Harbin held a rally to resume classes and make revolution, vowing to launch a new high tide of struggle, criticism, and transformation.

Representatives from the 15th, 47th, 43rd, and the Third Health School, which have already achieved the resumption of classes and making revolution, shared their experiences in achieving great unity and resuming classes and making revolution. They unanimously expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee closely and achieve the resumption of classes and making revolution as soon as possible.

Representatives from other middle schools also expressed at the rally that the key to successfully resuming classes and making revolution is to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize and overthrow the "self" ideology, seize the power of the "self," and overcome non-proletarian thoughts such as anarchism, sectarianism, small-groupism, and individualism. They emphasized the importance of achieving revolutionary great unity based on teaching classes, with the leftists as the core. Currently, it is particularly important to follow Chairman Mao's teachings and adopt the policy of unity-criticism-unity to correctly handle contradictions between various revolutionary mass organizations and revolutionary teachers and students. They should seek common ground while reserving differences, consider the big picture, and understand the overall situation. Under the premise of unity in the direction of struggle, they should unite and work together to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end.

The revolutionary teachers and students expressed their determination to take Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" as the guideline, learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line, thoroughly reform the bourgeois educational system, and establish Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line and educational system. They vowed to let the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought forever occupy the middle school battlefield. After the meeting, a grand parade was held by the revolutionary teachers and students.
