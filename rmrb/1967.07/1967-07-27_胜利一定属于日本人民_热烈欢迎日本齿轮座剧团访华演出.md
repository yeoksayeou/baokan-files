	“The seas are in turmoil, the clouds are angry, the continents shake, and the winds of thunder roar.” Just as the hundreds of millions of revolutionary people of our country, holding high the great red banner of criticizing the revolution with Mao Zedong Thought, are displaying the thorough revolutionary spirit of thoroughly beating the “falling dogs,” and are launching a powerful revolutionary criticism against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, just as the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are surging forward with armed struggles, the friends of the Kokuritsuza Theater Troupe have bravely broken through the numerous obstacles set up by the Sato government, which is the agent of U.S. imperialism, and the Japanese Communist Party revisionists, and have made their first friendly visit to our country for performances. We, the cultural and sports warriors of the revolutionary faction of the PLA stationed in Beijing, are filled with boundless excitement and express our warmest congratulations and sincerest welcome!

	The Kokuritsuza Theater Troupe has gone through more than a decade of arduous struggles, emerging from the thick encirclement and white terror of U.S. imperialism, the Japanese reactionary government, and the Japanese Communist Party revisionists. The friends of the Kokuritsuza Theater Troupe have an unlimited love for our great leader Chairman Mao and the boundless brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought. They firmly believe that as long as they act according to Chairman Mao’s teachings, there is no difficulty that cannot be overcome. They are fearless of violence, unafraid of hardships, steadfast in truth, daring in struggle, and rich in revolutionary rebellious spirit. They are cultural warriors who hold high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, fighting against imperialism and revisionism!

	Such a revolutionary theater troupe is deeply hated by the Japanese Communist Party revisionists, who have long harbored malicious intentions to strike them down. Since last year, the Japanese Communist Party revisionists have intensified their sabotage of Kokuritsuza. In September last year, the Japanese Communist Party revisionists sent people to Kokuritsuza to slander our proletarian cultural revolution, accusing Kokuritsuza of “blindly following foreigners,” distributing a large number of slanderous leaflets against Kokuritsuza, and even inciting their agents who had infiltrated the troupe to sabotage Kokuritsuza’s performances. The despicable actions of the Japanese Communist Party revisionists aroused the indignation of the Kokuritsuza members. They fought back against the Japanese Communist Party revisionists, foiled their plots, and finally drove out a handful of revisionists from the troupe in January this year, defending the revolutionary nature of Kokuritsuza.

	During the struggle, the members of Kokuritsuza insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao’s works, determined to follow the revolutionary direction of literature and art pointed out by Chairman Mao, and to firmly walk the path of serving the workers, peasants, and laboring masses. They said, “We will go deep into the countryside, live and work with the peasants, and learn from the peasants.” They went to the most remote and poorest village in Yamaguchi Prefecture—Miyato—and humbly learned from the peasants, serving the workers and peasants. They performed plays reflecting the struggles of today’s impoverished Japanese peasants against oppression and exploitation, which were warmly welcomed and enthusiastically supported by the broad audience. Their achievements on the path of integrating with the workers and peasants have further strengthened their confidence. A responsible person from Kokuritsuza said, “Chairman Mao’s ‘Talks at the Yan’an Forum on Literature and Art’ is our guide to action. It is Mao Zedong Thought that has helped us see through the anti-people nature of the Japanese Communist Party’s revisionist line on literature and art, and has enabled us to achieve victory in the long struggle against the capitalist and revisionist lines. Although the Japanese Communist Party revisionists and the Japanese reactionaries strongly oppose us and try to sabotage us, we will not waver and will continue to firmly advance along the direction of literature and art pointed out by Chairman Mao!” This sincere and pure sentiment, this resolute language, expresses the Kokuritsuza friends’ deep love for the great leader of the world’s revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and their lofty feelings for Mao Zedong Thought. It also expresses their firm determination to follow Chairman Mao’s revolutionary path of literature and art, unyielding in the face of wind and waves.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out, “The Japanese people are good friends of the Chinese people. The peoples of China and Japan should unite.” The friends of the Kokuritsuza Theater Troupe have made great efforts to strengthen the friendship and unity between the Chinese and Japanese peoples and have made significant contributions to the friendship between the peoples of the two countries. The handful of Japanese Communist Party revisionists have betrayed Marxism-Leninism, followed the Soviet revisionist clique, wantonly sabotaged the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese peoples, and fiercely opposed China. They will not have a good end!

	Now, the evil U.S. imperialism is still trampling on the territory of the Japanese people, committing atrocities, and using Japan as a base to invade Vietnam, China, and Asia. This is something that the peoples of China and Japan cannot accept! Chairman Mao said: “The various persecutions inflicted by imperialism and reactionaries on the revolutionary people will, in the long run, only serve to promote more extensive and more violent revolutions among the people.” Looking at the world, the seas are in turmoil, the continents shake, and armed struggles are blazing in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. The Japanese people, who have a revolutionary fighting tradition, are displaying great fearlessness and are engaged in unyielding struggles against U.S. imperialism and the Sato reactionary government. Japan belongs to the Japanese people, and the final victory will certainly belong to the Japanese people!

    胜利一定属于日本人民——热烈欢迎日本齿轮座剧团访华演出
    陆海空三军驻京部队无产阶级革命派文体战士联合演出委员会
    “四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。”正当我国亿万革命人民，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，发扬痛打“落水狗”的彻底革命精神，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开了声势浩大的革命大批判的时候，正当亚非拉革命人民武装斗争风起云涌的时候，日本齿轮座剧团的朋友们，胜利地冲破了美帝国主义的代理人佐藤政府和日共修正主义分子的重重阻力，首次来我国进行友好访问演出，我们陆海空三军驻京部队无产阶级革命派文体战士，怀着万分激动的心情，表示最热烈的祝贺，最真挚的欢迎！
    齿轮座剧团是经历了十多年艰苦奋战，从美帝、日本反动政府及日共修正主义分子的重重包围和白色恐怖之下“杀”出来的一个进步的革命剧团。齿轮座剧团的朋友们，对我们的伟大领袖毛主席和光焰无际的毛泽东思想无限热爱。他们坚信，只要照毛主席的教导办事，没有克服不了的困难。他们不畏强暴，不怕困难，坚持真理，敢于斗争，富有革命造反精神。他们是高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗的反帝、反修的文艺战士！
    对这样一个革命的剧团，日共修正主义分子无比仇视，早就蓄意打击。从去年下半年以来，日共修正主义分子破坏齿轮座的活动更是变本加厉。去年九月，日共修正主义分子派人到齿轮座大肆诽谤我国无产阶级文化大革命，诬蔑齿轮座是“盲从外国”，大量散发诽谤齿轮座的黑传单，还唆使他们打入剧团的爪牙破坏齿轮座的公演活动。日共修正主义分子的无耻行径，激起了齿轮座团员们的无比愤怒。他们与日共修正主义分子展开了针锋相对的斗争，粉碎了日共修正主义分子的阴谋诡计，终于在今年一月把一小撮修正主义分子赶出了剧团，保卫了齿轮座的革命性。
    齿轮座的团员们在斗争中坚持活学活用毛主席著作，决心沿着毛主席指出的革命文艺方向，坚定地走为工农劳动群众服务的道路。他们表示决心：“我们要深入农村，与农民同吃同住同劳动，向农民学习。”他们深入到山口县最偏僻、最贫穷的山村——弥富，甘当农民的小学生，虚心向农民学习，为工农群众服务。他们排演反映今天日本贫苦农民受压迫、受剥削，觉醒起来进行英勇斗争的戏，受到广大观众的热烈欢迎和热情支持。他们在与工农结合的道路上所取得的可喜成就，更加坚定了他们的信心。齿轮座一位负责人说：“毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》是我们行动的指南。是毛泽东思想使我们认清了日共修正主义文艺路线的反人民本质，在长期反对资本主义、修正主义路线斗争中取得了胜利。虽然日共修正主义分子和美日反动派极力反对我们和进行破坏，但是我们决不动摇，要继续坚定地沿着毛主席指出的文艺方向前进！”这种诚挚纯朴的感情，这种斩钉截铁的语言，表达了齿轮座朋友们热爱世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席，热爱毛泽东思想的崇高感情，表达了他们坚定地走毛主席的革命文艺道路，任凭风吹浪打毫不动摇的钢铁决心。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“日本人民同中国人民是好朋友。”“中日两国人民要联合起来”。齿轮座剧团的朋友们努力加强中日人民友好团结，为中日两国人民的友谊作出了很大的贡献。日共一小撮修正主义分子，背叛马克思列宁主义，追随苏修集团，肆意破坏中日两国人民友谊，猖狂反华，决不会有好下场！
    现在，万恶的美帝国主义还践踏着日本人民的领土，逞凶霸道，并把日本作为侵略越南、侵略中国、侵略亚洲的基地，这是中日两国人民决不能答应的！毛主席说：帝国主义和反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”放眼世界，四海翻腾，五洲震荡，亚非拉到处燃起了武装斗争的熊熊烈火。富有革命斗争传统的日本人民，发扬大无畏的革命精神，正在同美帝国主义和佐藤反动政府展开不屈不挠的斗争。日本是属于日本人民的，最后胜利必将属于日本人民！
