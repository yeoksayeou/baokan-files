	Danish *Politiken* Condemns Soviet Revisionists for Betraying the Arab People
	Soviet Revisionists Use the Middle East Issue to Deal with U.S. Imperialism

	BEIJING, July 13 (Xinhua) -- COPENHAGEN -- The Danish Communist Group's publication *Politiken* recently published an article strongly condemning the Soviet revisionist leadership clique for acting as accomplices of U.S. imperialism and betraying the interests of the Arab people.

	The article states that the Soviet revisionist clique is striving to strengthen cooperation with U.S. imperialism and attempting to use the Middle East issue to make the biggest overall deal with the U.S. The article points out, "Suppressing the Arab people's liberation struggle serves the common interests of Soviet revisionism and U.S. imperialism," and the Middle East issue "once again exposes the shameful cooperation between U.S. and British imperialism and Soviet revisionism to strangle the liberation struggle of the oppressed peoples."

	In exposing the Soviet revisionist clique's hypocritical support and actual betrayal of the Arab people, the article points out: "The Soviet Union sent part of its Black Sea Fleet to the Eastern Mediterranean to give the impression to Arab countries that Soviet aid is serious. However, the Soviet fleet cordially greeted the U.S. Sixth Fleet, which is stationed in the same waters as a military threat to Arab countries and a support for Israel. This indicates that the two fleets are serving the same purpose."

	The article states that the Soviet revisionists, using the "hotline" between Washington and Moscow, plotted to force Arab countries to accept a "ceasefire." This "ceasefire" plot first forces the invaded Arab countries to stop resisting, and second, acknowledges the land seized by Israel in the aggression. The article concludes by expressing the belief that, despite the betrayal of the Soviet revisionists, the Arab people will ultimately defeat imperialism.

    丹麦《方针报》谴责苏修出卖阿拉伯人民
    苏修利用中东问题同美帝做交易
    新华社十三日讯　哥本哈根消息：丹麦共产主义小组的刊物《方针报》最近发表文章，强烈谴责苏联修正主义领导集团充当美帝国主义的帮凶，出卖阿拉伯人民利益的背叛行径。
    文章说，苏修集团竭力在加强同美帝的合作，企图利用中东问题来同美帝进行最大的全面交易。文章指出，“遏制阿拉伯人民的解放斗争是符合苏联修正主义和美帝国主义的共同利益的”，中东问题“再一次暴露了美、英帝国主义和苏联修正主义为扼杀被压迫人民的解放斗争而进行的可耻合作”。
    文章在揭露苏修集团对阿拉伯人民的假支持真出卖的罪恶勾当时指出：“苏联派出了部分黑海舰队去东地中海，为的是给阿拉伯国家以印象，似乎苏联的援助保证是认真的。但是，苏联的舰队向美国第六舰队亲切地致意，而美国的第六舰队是作为对阿拉伯国家的一种军事威胁和对以色列的支持而留在同一领海的。这表明，两支舰队出现是为同一个目的服务的。”
    文章说，苏修利用华盛顿和莫斯科之间的“热线”，策划了迫使阿拉伯国家接受“停火”的阴谋。这一“停火”阴谋首先是迫使遭受侵略的阿拉伯国家停止反抗，其次是承认以色列在侵略战争中所侵占的土地。文章最后表示深信，尽管苏联修正主义者的背叛，阿拉伯人民最后终将战胜帝国主义。
