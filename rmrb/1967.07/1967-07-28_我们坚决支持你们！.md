We resolutely support you!
Beijing Institute of Geology East Is Red Commune

The sea leans on the mountain, the mountain leans on the sea; the hearts of the proletarian revolutionaries are with the proletarian revolutionaries. The sea leans on the mountain, the mountain leans on the sea; Mao Zedong Thought tightly connects us, the East Is Red fighters, with the Wuhan revolutionaries!

The struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries in the Wuhan area has always inspired us. The proletarian revolutionaries in the Wuhan area have always been our close comrades at the Beijing Institute of Geology.

Recently, a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the military in the Wuhan area, along with a handful of bad leaders they control within the "Million Heroes," have launched a frenzied counterattack against the proletarian revolutionaries in the Wuhan area. They have even brazenly directed their spears at the Party Central Committee and Chairman Mao. All of us East Is Red fighters are filled with indignation and burning with rage. We have put up big-character posters, held mass meetings, and organized grand parades and demonstrations to denounce the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the military in the Wuhan area. We resolutely support our comrades, the Wuhan revolutionaries.

Comrades, the Wuhan revolutionaries, we resolutely support you. We will fight resolutely to defend Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, whoever opposes Vice Chairman Lin, whoever opposes the Party Central Committee, whoever opposes Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, whoever opposes the Central Cultural Revolution Group, we will overthrow them!

We resolutely support you in thoroughly defeating the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the military in the Wuhan area and the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes." We resolutely support you in carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan area through to the end.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "What is the real steel wall and iron wall? It is the masses, the hundreds of millions of people who truly and sincerely support the revolution."

The revolutionary people of Wuhan, with their revolutionary traditions, are indomitable and fearless! The experience and lessons of class struggle have made them even wiser. They will surely raise high the great red banner of invincible Mao Zedong Thought and, together with the revolutionary masses throughout the country, thoroughly defeat the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the military in the Wuhan area, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

We believe that after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution movement has swept away the garbage, what will appear on the vast land of China is a Wuhan bathed in the boundless sunshine of Mao Zedong Thought!

    我们坚决支持你们！
    北京地质学院东方红公社
    海靠着山，山靠着海，无产阶级革命派心向着无产阶级革命派；海靠着山，山靠着海，毛泽东思想把我们东方红战士和武汉革命派紧紧地联接起来！
    武汉地区无产阶级革命派的斗争，时刻鼓舞着我们。武汉地区的无产阶级革命派一直是我们北京地质学院东方红战士的亲密战友。
    最近，武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其所操纵的“百万雄师”中的一小撮坏头头，向武汉地区的无产阶级革命派进行疯狂反扑，并且猖狂地把矛头直接指向党中央、毛主席。我广大东方红战士无不义愤填膺，怒火万丈。我们出大字报，开群众大会，举行盛大的游行示威，愤怒声讨武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，我们坚决支持武汉地区革命派的战友。
    武汉地区的革命战友们，我们坚决支持你们，为保卫毛主席，保卫林副主席，保卫党中央，保卫中央文革，捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线而进行坚决斗争。谁反对毛主席，谁反对林副主席，谁反对党中央，谁反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，谁反对中央文革，我们就打倒谁！
    我们坚决支持你们，彻底打倒武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及“百万雄师”中的一小撮坏头头。我们坚决支持你们，把武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    毛主席教导我们，“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。”
    具有革命传统的武汉人民，是压不服，吓不倒的！阶级斗争的经验和教训使得他们更加聪明起来。他们一定能高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，和全国革命群众一道，彻底打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫和武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    我们相信，经过无产阶级文化大革命运动，清除了垃圾之后，出现在中国大地上的，必将是光焰无际的毛泽东思想阳光普照的武汉！
