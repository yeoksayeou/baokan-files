Seven colleges and universities in Shandong Province have started classes and are making revolution, taking Beijing Institute of Aeronautics as an example. The seven institutions are Shandong Institute of Technology, Shandong Normal University, Lu Xun University (formerly Shandong University), Shandong Medical College, Huadong Mining Institute (formerly Shandong Coal Mining Institute), Shandong Institute of Finance and Economics, and Shandong College of Traditional Chinese Medicine.

Starting classes and making revolution is a common demand of the revolutionary teachers and students in Jinan. Half a month ago, revolutionary youngsters from Shandong Institute of Technology and other units had already put up big-character posters calling for starting classes and making revolution. On July 5, after the news of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics starting classes and making revolution reached Jinan, the colleges and universities immediately became lively. Revolutionary teachers and students immediately put up big-character posters saying, "Follow Chairman Mao's words, start classes and make revolution!" "Learn from the revolutionary comrades of Beihang!" Various schools held "start classes and make revolution" inauguration meetings.

What should be the first thing to do when starting classes and making revolution? Many schools have had heated discussions on this issue. Revolutionary teachers and students generally believe that starting classes and making revolution must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and push the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works to a new high. Currently, the focus should be on criticism, struggle, criticism, and reform, and educational revolution, gradually transitioning to full-scale classes. Starting classes is not about "restoring the old," but about making an educational revolution, thoroughly criticizing the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line pushed by China's Khrushchev, smashing the bourgeois educational system, teaching principles, and methods, and resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary educational line. Establish a proletarian educational system, teaching principles, and methods, and turn our schools into "red schools" of Mao Zedong Thought that are "primarily academic, with a bit of everything, that is, not only study literature but also industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticize the bourgeoisie."

After full discussion, various colleges and universities have made arrangements for starting classes and making revolution according to their actual situations. Shandong Normal University, Shandong College of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Lu Xun University have arranged that July will focus on criticism, with a bit of everything; August will focus on reform, and from September onwards, full-scale classes will resume. In specific arrangements, each school has proposed to dare to practice, dare to innovate, boldly explore, summarize, and improve.

In starting classes and making revolution, Jinan colleges and universities have put forward specific requirements and arrangements for revolutionary cadres, teachers, and graduates.

The revolutionary committees of various colleges and universities have received great care and support from the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee in starting classes and making revolution.

    大破旧的教育制度，创造崭新的无产阶级教育制度
    山东七所大专院校开始复课闹革命
    据新华社济南十一日电  山东省有七所大专院校以北京航空学院为榜样，从七月五日起复课闹革命。这七所院校是山东工学院、山东师范学院、鲁迅大学（原山东大学）、山东医学院、华东矿业学院（原山东煤矿学院）、山东财经学院、山东中医学院。
    复课闹革命，是济南各大专院校广大革命师生的普遍要求。早在半月之前，山东工学院等单位的革命小将就贴出了要求复课闹革命的大字标语。五日，北京航空学院复课闹革命的消息传到济南后，各大专院校立即沸腾起来，革命师生马上贴出了“听毛主席的话，复课闹革命！”“向北航革命战友学习！”的大标语。各院校先后召开了“复课闹革命誓师大会”。
    复课闹革命，首先应复什么课？许多院校就这一问题展开了热烈讨论。广大革命师生认为，复课闹革命，必须更好地活学活用毛主席著作，把学习毛主席著作的群众运动推向新高潮。复课闹革命，当前要以大批判为主，进行斗、批、改和教育革命，逐步过渡到全面复课。复课，决不是“复旧”，而是要闹教育革命，彻底批判中国的赫鲁晓夫推行的反革命修正主义教育路线，大破资产阶级教育制度、教学方针和方法，坚决贯彻毛主席的革命教育路线，大立无产阶级教育制度、教学方针和方法，把我们学校办成“以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级”的红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。在复课闹革命中，我们要活学活用毛主席著作，紧紧地抓住两条路线斗争这个纲，破私立公，克服小资产阶级摇摆性，加强无产阶级革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，促进思想革命化，作一个彻底的无产阶级革命派。
    经过充分讨论，各大专院校根据自己的实际情况，对复课闹革命作了安排。山东师范学院、中医学院、鲁迅大学的安排是：七月份以大批判为主，兼学别样；八月份以改为主，九月以后全面复课。在具体安排上，各个学校都提出，一定要敢于实践，敢于创造，大胆探索，边总结、边改进。
    济南各大专院校在复课闹革命中，对革命干部、教师和毕业生都提出了具体要求，并作了具体安排。
    各大专院校复课闹革命，得到了山东省革命委员会的极大关怀和支持。
