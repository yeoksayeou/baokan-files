To lead five hundred million peasants down the broad avenue of socialism, or to lead them into the capitalist quagmire? On this question, since liberation, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao has been in sharp struggle with the reactionary bourgeois line represented by China's Khrushchev.

Who has been vigorously advocating the "four freedoms" and praising "exploitation as a merit"? Who has been hacking away at agricultural production cooperatives and sabotaging agricultural collectivization? Who has been pushing the "three autonomies and one contract" and spreading the single-operation wind? Over the past seventeen years, every time a black wind has blown through the countryside and every time a malicious wave has surged, it has been this China's Khrushchev stirring up trouble.

We must make the poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses of commune members understand that unless we overthrow, smash, and expose the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, the restoration of capitalism will be imminent, and the overthrown landlords and rich peasants may once again ride roughshod over us. We must make the poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses of commune members understand that only by following Chairman Mao's words and firmly walking the socialist path, consolidating the collective economy, can the five hundred million peasants achieve complete liberation.

The poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses of commune members in Chunlight Brigade, Taopu Commune, Jiading County, Shanghai, have precisely in the great revolutionary criticism of the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, gained a deeper understanding of these truths. This is a good experience in the rural cultural revolution. It is a great thing for five hundred million peasants to rise up and criticize China's Khrushchev.

Some people think that the poor and lower-middle peasants have little education and low theoretical level, and cannot criticize much. This view is wrong. Although some poor and lower-middle peasants have low cultural levels, they have the bitter experience of being oppressed and exploited as beasts of burden in the old society; they have the spirit of "three donkey legs starting a cooperative," and the determination to firmly walk the socialist path; they have seen with their own eyes the serious damage that "three autonomies and one contract" has caused to the rural collective economy, and have an intense hatred for capitalist forces. They have an understanding, feelings, and experiences of the socialist path indicated by Chairman Mao. The junk peddled by the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party, although there are many tricks and many gimmicks, its essence is only one: to restore capitalism. As long as we firmly grasp the "main thread" of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, and combine it with living examples, we can carry out a profound, vivid, and powerful revolutionary criticism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "A serious problem is the education of the peasants." To guide the peasants to advance unwaveringly on the socialist path, we must carry out socialist education, we must carry out the cultural revolution of the proletariat, and arm the minds of five hundred million peasants with Mao Zedong Thought. In the revolutionary criticism movement, the poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses of commune members will further realize that if they do not seize the power of the "self" in their minds, if they only see the immediate personal interests, cast aside collective production, and focus on "private plots" and "private profits," they will unknowingly be led astray and be used by class enemies to carry out the restoration of capitalism.

This year, China's agricultural production is in a very good situation. Through the cultural revolution of the proletariat, the broad masses of commune members have studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, educated themselves, further promoted ideological revolutionization, and boosted production enthusiasm. At the current critical juncture of the summer harvest, we must carry out revolutionary criticism like the commune members of Chunlight Brigade, using the spare time from production to hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, and do a good job in collective production, striving for a double harvest of revolution and production.

　　五亿农民都来批判中国的赫鲁晓夫
　　本报评论员
    把五亿农民引向社会主义的康庄大道，还是引向资本主义的泥坑？在这个问题上，解放以来，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，同以中国的赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级反动路线，一直进行着针锋相对的激烈斗争。
    是谁在极力鼓吹“四大自由”，宣扬“剥削有功”？是谁大砍农业生产合作社，破坏农业合作化？是谁大搞“三自一包”，大刮单干风？十七年来，农村中每刮起一阵黑风，每掀起一股恶浪，都是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫在捣鬼。
    要使贫下中农和广大社员都懂得，不把党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的，被推翻了的地主、富农就有可能重新骑在我们头上。要使贫下中农和广大社员都懂得，只有听毛主席的话，坚持走社会主义的道路，巩固集体经济，才能使五亿农民获得彻底的解放。
    上海嘉定县桃浦公社春光二队的贫下中农和广大社员，正是在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的革命大批判中，更加深刻地认识了这些道理。这是农村无产阶级文化大革命的一个好经验。五亿农民都起来批判中国的赫鲁晓夫，这是一件了不起的大事情。
    有人认为贫下中农识字不多，理论水平不高，批判不出什么名堂来。这种看法是不对的。有些贫下中农文化水平虽然不高，但是，他们有在旧社会当牛做马，受尽剥削压迫的痛苦经历；他们有“三条驴腿办起一个合作社”的穷棒子精神，有坚决走社会主义道路的决心；他们亲眼看到了“三自一包”给农村集体经济造成的严重损失，对资本主义势力有无比的仇恨。他们对毛主席所指引的社会主义道路，有认识，有感情，有体会。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所兜售的那套破烂货色，尽管花样不少，名堂很多，但其实质只有一个，就是要复辟资本主义。只要我们紧紧抓住两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的“纲”，结合活生生的事例，进行革命的大批判，就能够把这个斗争开展得很深刻，很生动，很有力。
    毛主席教导我们：“严重的问题是教育农民。”引导农民坚定不移地在社会主义道路上前进，必须开展社会主义教育运动，必须开展无产阶级文化大革命，用毛泽东思想武装五亿农民的头脑。贫下中农和广大社员，在革命的大批判运动中会进一步认识到，如果不夺自己头脑中的“私”字的权，如果只看到个人眼前的一点利益，把集体生产抛在一边，专搞“自留地”，搞“自搂”，就会不知不觉地被引入歧途，就会被阶级敌人所利用，去搞资本主义复辟。
    今年，我国农业生产是一派大好形势。广大社员通过无产阶级文化大革命，活学活用毛主席著作，自己教育自己，进一步促进了思想革命化，鼓足了生产干劲。在当前三夏大忙时节，开展革命的大批判，要象春光二队的社员一样，利用生产的空余时间，把革命批判的旗帜举得高高的，把集体生产搞得好好的，争取革命生产双丰收。
