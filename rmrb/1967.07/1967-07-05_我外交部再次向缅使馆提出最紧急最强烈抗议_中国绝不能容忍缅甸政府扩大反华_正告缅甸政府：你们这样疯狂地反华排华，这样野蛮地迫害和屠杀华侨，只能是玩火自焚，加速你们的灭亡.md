The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, on July 4, sent a note to the Burmese Embassy in China, urgently and strongly protesting the reactionary Burmese government's recent frenzied anti-Chinese and anti-ethnic Chinese activities, which have systematically led to large-scale persecution and massacre of ethnic Chinese, all for the sake of its reactionary domestic and foreign policies.

The note states: Recently, the Burmese government has been frenziedly engaging in anti-Chinese and anti-ethnic Chinese activities, committing inhuman and shocking persecutions and massacres against ethnic Chinese, and the situation is further deteriorating.

Since June 22, under the instigation and connivance of the Burmese government, thousands of rioters have brutally massacred ethnic Chinese. Preliminary information indicates that hundreds of ethnic Chinese have been killed in Rangoon alone. On June 27, rioters stormed the "Burmese Chinese Teachers' Association," beating 27 people to death and committing a horrifying fascist atrocity. In the following days, the number of injured ethnic Chinese is incalculable.

What is particularly intolerable is that after directing rioters to carry out large-scale massacres of ethnic Chinese, the Burmese government still does not allow the families of the deceased to identify and verify the bodies, acting in an extremely arrogant and unreasonable manner!

The note points out: While the Burmese government is brutally massacring ethnic Chinese, it is also arresting and imprisoning them in large numbers. On June 27, 600 ethnic Chinese students from the former Chinese Middle School and the former Nanyang Middle School, along with their parents, as well as ethnic Chinese from several suburban areas of Rangoon, were arrested and collectively imprisoned in a military camp. The Burmese radio on July 1 also admitted that approximately 1,300 ethnic Chinese have been imprisoned in the Rangoon Bengali Cave military camp. At the same time, the Burmese government ordered martial law in the areas where ethnic Chinese in Rangoon are concentrated, dispatching military and police to surround them, depriving the vast majority of ethnic Chinese of their freedom and preventing them from sustaining their livelihoods.

The note states: In recent days, the Burmese government has also instigated rioters to loot and destroy ethnic Chinese shops on a large scale, burning ethnic Chinese houses and property, causing ethnic Chinese to suffer heavy losses.

The note states: Although the Chinese government has strongly protested on many occasions, the anti-Chinese atrocities planned by the Burmese government have not only not been curbed but have spread to some small and medium-sized cities in Burma. In Mandalay, Magwe, Pyinmana, and Yangon, thousands of rioters have persecuted ethnic Chinese.

The note points out: This large-scale persecution of ethnic Chinese is entirely a result of the Burmese government's organized, planned, and step-by-step plotting and creation. Therefore, the Chinese government once again urgently and strongly protests to the Burmese government. The Chinese government solemnly declares: The broad masses of ethnic Chinese who have lived in Burma for generations have forged deep revolutionary friendships with the Burmese people. They have made significant contributions to promoting friendship between the peoples of China and Burma, supporting the Burmese people's revolutionary struggle against imperialism, and promoting the development of Burma's national economy. Anyone who attempts to erase the contributions of the broad masses of ethnic Chinese is absolutely impossible. Now, for the sake of its reactionary domestic and foreign policies, the Burmese government has gone against the interests and wishes of the Burmese people, disregarding all consequences, and systematically created the aforementioned barbaric fascist anti-Chinese and anti-ethnic Chinese atrocities. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people and is also absolutely intolerable to the Burmese people.

The note states: The Chinese government warns the Burmese government: Your frenzied anti-Chinese and anti-ethnic Chinese activities, your barbaric persecution and massacre of ethnic Chinese, can only lead to self-destruction and accelerate your downfall.

The note states: In view of the fact that the fascist anti-Chinese and anti-ethnic Chinese atrocities created by the Burmese government are still continuing and expanding, the Chinese government demands that the Burmese government must immediately take effective measures:

(1) Immediately stop the persecution of ethnic Chinese, ensure the safety of their lives and property, immediately release the arrested ethnic Chinese, lift the military siege of ethnic Chinese residential areas, and restore normal activities for ethnic Chinese.

(2) Immediately notify the Chinese government of the number of ethnic Chinese who have been killed, injured, and arrested, as well as detailed information about them. The Chinese Embassy in Burma will immediately dispatch personnel, accompanied by representatives of the families of the deceased ethnic Chinese, missing persons, and overseas Chinese associations, to verify the bodies of the deceased ethnic Chinese, comfort their families, visit and comfort the imprisoned and injured ethnic Chinese. The Burmese government must dispatch officials to accompany them.

(3) Severely punish the instigators and perpetrators of the killings of ethnic Chinese, take responsibility for the aftermath of the victims, comfort the families of the victims, and take responsibility for the treatment of the injured.

(4) Compensate for all losses suffered by ethnic Chinese and provide relief and resettlement for ethnic Chinese who are currently unable to live.

(5) Apologize publicly to the Chinese government and people, and to the broad masses of ethnic Chinese in Burma, and guarantee that there will be no more incidents of persecution of ethnic Chinese in the future.

The note concludes: Currently, the Chinese Embassy in Burma is still under the unreasonable siege of Burmese military and police, seriously hindering the normal work of the embassy. The Burmese government must immediately lift the unreasonable siege of the Chinese Embassy and guarantee all normal activities of the Chinese Embassy. In the situation where the Chinese Embassy cannot fully understand the severe persecution and losses suffered by ethnic Chinese, the Chinese government reserves the right to make further demands and take other necessary measures.

### 我外交部再次向缅使馆提出最紧急最强烈抗议　中国绝不能容忍缅甸政府扩大反华  正告缅甸政府：你们这样疯狂地反华排华，这样野蛮地迫害和屠杀华侨，只能是玩火自焚，加速你们的灭亡

　　我外交部再次向缅使馆提出最紧急最强烈抗议
　　中国绝不能容忍缅甸政府扩大反华
    正告缅甸政府：你们这样疯狂地反华排华，这样野蛮地迫害和屠杀华侨，只能是玩火自焚，加速你们的灭亡
    新华社四日讯　中华人民共和国外交部四日照会缅甸驻华大使馆，再次最紧急、最强烈地抗议缅甸反动政府为了反动的内外政策的需要，六月二十二日以来，疯狂地反华排华，有计划地制造大规模迫害和屠杀华侨的法西斯暴行。
    照会说：最近，缅甸政府疯狂地进行反华排华，对华侨进行了灭绝人性、令人发指的迫害和屠杀，而且情况还在进一步恶化。
    自六月二十二日以来，在缅甸政府唆使和纵容下，数千暴徒对华侨进行残酷的屠杀，据初步了解，仅仰光一地即有成百华侨被杀害。六月二十七日，暴徒冲入“缅甸华侨教师联合会”，活活打死了二十七人，制造了骇人听闻的法西斯暴行。连日来，受伤的华侨更不计其数。
    尤其令人不能容忍的是，缅甸政府在指使暴徒大规模屠杀华侨之后，还不允许死难者的家属认尸验尸，横蛮无理，达到极点！
    照会指出：在缅甸政府对华侨进行残酷屠杀的同时，还大批逮捕和囚禁华侨。六月二十七日，原华侨中学、原南洋中学的华侨学生和他们的家长共六百余人，以及仰光市郊几个地区的华侨被逮捕，集体关进军营。缅甸电台七月一日也承认，在仰光孟加拉洞军营，已囚禁了华侨约一千三百多人。与此同时，缅甸政府还下令对仰光华侨集中居住的地区，实行军事管制，派军警加以包围，使广大华侨失去自由，无法维持生计。
    照会说：连日来，缅甸政府还唆使暴徒大规模洗劫和捣毁华侨商店，烧毁华侨房屋和财产，使华侨遭到惨重的损失。
    照会说：中国政府虽然曾经多次强烈抗议，缅甸政府所策划的反华暴行不但没有收敛，反而蔓延到缅甸的一些中小城镇。在曼德勒、马圭、勃生、仁安羌等地，数以千计的暴徒，对华侨进行了迫害。
    照会指出：这次大规模迫害华侨的事件，完全是缅甸政府有组织、有计划、有步骤地策划制造的。为此，中国政府再次向缅甸政府提出最紧急、最强烈的抗议。中国政府严正指出：世世代代居住在缅甸的广大华侨，已经同缅甸人民结下了深厚的战斗友谊。他们对增进中缅两国人民的友好，对支持缅甸人民反对帝国主义的革命斗争，对促进缅甸民族经济的发展，都作出了重大的贡献。任何人企图抹煞广大华侨的这种贡献，是绝对办不到的。现在，缅甸政府为了反动的内外政策的需要，竟然违背缅甸人民的利益和意愿，不顾一切后果，有计划地制造了上述野蛮的法西斯反华排华暴行。这是中国人民绝对不能容忍的，也是缅甸人民绝对不能容忍的。
    照会说，中国政府正告缅甸政府：你们这样疯狂地反华排华，这样野蛮地迫害和屠杀华侨，只能是玩火自焚，加速你们的灭亡。
    照会说：鉴于目前缅甸政府所一手制造的反华排华法西斯暴行还在继续蔓延和扩大，中国政府要求缅甸政府必须迅速采取有效措施：
    （一）立即制止对华侨的迫害，切实保证华侨的生命和财产的安全，立即释放被捕华侨，解除对华侨居住区的武装包围，恢复华侨的正常活动。
    （二）立即将被杀害、打伤和逮捕的华侨的人数，以及有关他们的详细情况，通知中国政府。中国驻缅甸大使馆将立即派人由死难华侨家属、失踪者家属和侨团代表陪同前去查验死难华侨的尸体，慰问他们的家属，探望并慰问被囚和受伤的华侨，缅甸政府必须派出官员陪同前往。
    （三）严惩杀害华侨的主使者和凶手，负责受难华侨的善后，抚恤受难者的家属，负责对受伤者的治疗。
    （四）赔偿华侨的一切损失，对目前无法生活的华侨予以救济和安置。
    （五）向中国政府和人民，向缅甸的广大华侨公开道歉，保证以后不再发生迫害华侨的事件。
    照会最后说：目前，中国驻缅甸大使馆仍处在缅甸军警的无理包围中，大使馆的正常工作受到严重的妨碍，缅甸政府必须立即撤除对中国大使馆的无理包围，保证中国大使馆的一切正常活动。在中国大使馆无法全面了解华侨所受严重迫害和损失的情况下，中国政府保留进一步提出要求和采取其它必要措施的权利。
