The Invincible New Revolutionary Forces
— Once Again Congratulating the Proletarian Revolutionaries of Wuhan on Achieving Greater Victories

Yesterday, the military stationed in Wuhan and the proletarian revolutionaries held a grand rally to swear to launch a new high tide of criticism against China’s Khrushchev and the handful of power-holders within the Party and the army who are taking the capitalist road. This meeting was well held! It shows the firm resolution of the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan to carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end, and it shows that the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan, under the guidance of Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, is advancing victoriously.

The proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan have emerged from a long period of white terror imposed by the bourgeois reactionary line. They fear no violence, fight tenaciously, press forward unyieldingly, break through all obstacles, withstand severe tests, and bravely uphold and defend Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line, creating today’s victorious situation. In this recent great struggle between the two classes, they have established immortal merits for the Cultural Revolution.

The proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan are outstanding! They are truly the revolutionary backbone of the proletariat!

We salute the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan, who have been tempered in the stormy waves!

Under the auspices of a great situation, the proletarian revolutionaries must clearly see that to achieve a thorough victory, they must be prepared for arduous struggles. However, the tide of history is irresistible. The new revolutionary forces are invincible. Victory will surely belong to the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan who advance along Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: “We can rely on our own organized forces to defeat all domestic and foreign reactionaries.”

We are fully confident that the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan have the courage, wisdom, and ability to liberate themselves. They will surely be able to rely on their own strength to smash all the enemy’s plots and tricks and thoroughly overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party and the army in Wuhan who are taking the capitalist road. As long as they unswervingly implement Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line; in the struggle, study and apply Chairman Mao’s works actively, resolutely carry out the Party’s policies, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle; raise high the banner of great alliance, strengthen unity, and fight the enemy together; constantly summarize experience, and constantly improve the art of struggle, they will surely achieve thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan.

The masses who have been deceived are revolutionary. They will surely awaken and turn against their deceivers. They will surely be able to liberate themselves. The proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan are doing in-depth and meticulous political and ideological work among the deceived masses and have already achieved good results. In the future, they must continue to do so with full enthusiasm and help them.

The broad ranks of officers and soldiers stationed in Wuhan, who stand firmly with the revolutionary masses, are the strong backing of the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan. You must firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionaries who uphold Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, share their anxieties, think of their needs, and wholeheartedly, enthusiastically, and unambiguously support them in every way. Breathe with them, share their fate, and together achieve thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan, and make new contributions to the people!

    革命的新生力量所向无敌
    ——再祝武汉地区无产阶级革命派夺取更大的新胜利
    昨天，武汉地区驻军和无产阶级革命派，举行了隆重的誓师大会，决心掀起一个向中国的赫鲁晓夫，向党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行大批判的新高潮。这个会开得好！它表明武汉地区的无产阶级革命派誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的坚强决心，表明武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的指引下，胜利前进。
    武汉地区的无产阶级革命派，是在资产阶级反动路线的长期白色恐怖下冲杀出来的。他们不畏强暴，艰苦奋战，一往无前，冲破了重重阻力，经受了严重考验，英勇地坚持和捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，创造出今天这样的胜利局面。在最近这场两个阶级的大搏斗中，他们又为无产阶级文化大革命建立了不朽的功勋。
    武汉地区的无产阶级革命派是好样的！他们不愧是无产阶级的革命硬骨头！
    我们向在惊涛骇浪中锻炼出来的武汉地区无产阶级革命派致以战斗的敬礼！
    在一派大好形势下，无产阶级革命派必须清醒地看到，要夺取彻底的胜利，还要准备进行艰巨的斗争。但是，历史的潮流不可阻挡。革命的新生力量所向无敌。胜利一定属于沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线前进的武汉地区无产阶级革命派！
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“我们能够依靠自己组织的力量，打败一切中外反动派。”
    我们完全相信，武汉地区的无产阶级革命派，是有勇气、有智慧、有能力自己解放自己的，是一定能够依靠自己的力量，粉碎敌人的一切阴谋诡计，把武汉地区党内军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派彻底打倒的。只要他们坚定不移地贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线；在斗争中，活学活用毛主席著作，坚决执行党的政策，紧紧掌握斗争大方向；高举革命大联合的旗帜，加强团结，共同对敌；不断地总结经验，不断地提高斗争艺术，就一定能够夺取武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    受蒙蔽的群众是要革命的。他们一定会觉醒过来，反戈一击，也一定能够自己解放自己。武汉地区的无产阶级革命派正在对受蒙蔽的群众进行深入细致的政治思想工作，已经取得了很好的成效。今后要继续坚持这样做，满腔热情地帮助他们。
    紧紧和革命群众站在一起的武汉驻军广大指战员，是武汉地区无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾。你们一定要紧紧地站在坚持毛主席革命路线的无产阶级革命派一边，急他们所急，想他们所想，全心全意地、满腔热情地、毫不含糊地从各个方面支援他们，和他们同呼吸，共命运，去夺取武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，为人民作出新贡献！
                                           （七月二十八日）
