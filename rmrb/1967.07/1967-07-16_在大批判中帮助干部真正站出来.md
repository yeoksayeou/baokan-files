	How can revolutionary cadres truly stand out?

	Writing a big-character poster, expressing an opinion at a meeting, or organizing a collective signature to make an appearance—does this count as truly standing out?

	Announcing at a large meeting, combining cadres with the masses, giving cadres some work, or restoring them to their original positions—does this count as truly helping cadres stand out?

	The experience of the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team of a certain unit under the Heilongjiang Provincial Military Region proves: cadres truly standing out means clearly distinguishing themselves politically and ideologically from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and from the bourgeois reactionary line, firmly standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; it means standing firmly with the proletarian revolutionary masses, clearly supporting all their revolutionary actions; it means having a high sense of responsibility towards the Party and the revolutionary cause, daring to work despite difficulties, daring to take responsibility, and shouldering the dual burdens of revolution and production.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: the transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation.

	The most important thing for revolutionary cadres to stand out is to throw themselves into the great winds and waves of the masses' struggle, to experience storms and see the world, and to change the objective world while seriously changing their subjective world. The current nationwide revolutionary criticism and struggle is the best classroom for transforming thoughts. All revolutionary cadres should accept the new test of the mass movement in this struggle, strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, deeply touch their souls, fiercely struggle against selfishness, and deeply root Mao Zedong Thought in their minds. As the comrades from the Shuangyashan Mining Area say: "Mao Zedong Thought is indispensable, class struggle must not be forgotten, selfishness must be fought, and ideological transformation must not be slackened."

	The proletarian revolutionary masses should help revolutionary cadres stand out by firmly grasping the central link of ideological education, allowing cadres to temper and improve themselves in the practice of class struggle and production struggle. Cadres should be closely connected with the revolutionary masses, striving to achieve new merits and new labor in the battle of seizing revolution and promoting production. They should dare to speak what needs to be said, dare to do what needs to be done, and dare to manage what needs to be managed, not only daring to manage production but also daring to seize revolution. In this way, revolutionary cadres can truly play their due role.

    在大批判中帮助干部真正站出来
    本报评论员
    革命干部怎样才算是真正站出来了？
    写张大字报，会上表个态，搞个什么集体签名亮相，算不算真正站出来了？
    大会宣布一下，和干部“三结合”，给干部一些工作，或者让他们“官复原职”，算不算真正帮助干部站出来了？
    黑龙江省军区某部毛泽东思想宣传队的经验证明：干部真正站出来，就是要在政治上思想上划清与党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的界限，划清与资产阶级反动路线的界限，坚定不移地站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边；就是要坚定地同无产阶级革命派站在一起，旗帜鲜明地支持他们的一切革命行动；就是要具有对党对革命事业的高度责任感，不畏艰难，敢于工作，勇于负责，挑起革命和生产的两副重担。
    毛主席教导我们说：世界观的转变是一个根本的转变。
    革命干部站出来，最重要的，在于投身到群众斗争大风大浪中去，经风雨，见世面，在改造客观世界的同时，认真地改造主观世界。当前正在全国范围内开展的革命大批判、大斗争，正是改造思想的最好课堂。一切革命干部，都应该在这场斗争中接受群众运动新的考验，努力活学活用毛主席著作，狠触灵魂，狠斗“私”字，把毛泽东思想的根子在头脑里扎得深深的。正如双鸭山矿区的同志们所讲的那样：“毛泽东思想离不得，阶级斗争忘不得，私心不斗了不得，思想改造松不得。”
    无产阶级革命派帮助革命干部站出来，应该紧紧抓住思想教育这个中心环节，放手让干部在阶级斗争、生产斗争的实践中锻炼和提高。要使干部和革命群众血肉相连，争取在抓革命、促生产的战斗中建新功、立新劳，该说的敢说，该做的敢做，该管的敢管，不仅敢管生产，而且敢抓革命。这样，革命干部就能发挥出他们应有的作用。
