	The proletarian revolutionary cadres of the Guizhou Medical Equipment Factory, after seizing power, grasped the essential task of revolutionary criticism and combined it closely with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own unit. They resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's instructions on health work, corrected the service direction, and promoted production and work.

	Since the day this factory officially started production, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party had set a direction for it to mainly serve a few urban lords, saying that "ensuring the repair of a few large hospitals in Guiyang would suffice." In reality, the factory's main efforts were focused on serving a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, repairing items like cold storage units, household refrigerators, steel beds, and radios for them. Based on the situation over the past ten years since the factory was established, the proletarian revolutionary cadres believed that it was necessary to use the great thought of Mao Zedong as a weapon to launch a revolutionary criticism movement and thoroughly eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism.

	The factory's revolutionary criticism began with criticizing the "strike down a large group, protect a small group" line of the bourgeoisie. This criticism effectively promoted revolutionary unity and the "three-in-one combination." Following this, the factory focused on criticizing three main issues related to its service direction and management practices that were influenced by revisionism.

	First, they criticized the factory's policy of serving only a few lords. A handful of capitalist-roaders within the party stubbornly resisted Chairman Mao's series of great instructions on health work. In production, they did not consider the needs of the countryside at all and only served a few lords. In terms of service attitude, they were extremely deferential to a few lords, always ready to respond to their calls. Once, the Duoyun County Hospital sent a high-pressure sterilizer from hundreds of miles away for repair. This sterilizer only needed a few minutes to replace a pressure gauge, but a handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory deliberately delayed the repair for three or four days before starting the work.

	Second, they criticized the revisionist management method of "production and sales entrusted to individuals." A handful of capitalist-roaders within the factory, in order to restore capitalism, promoted material incentives and falsely claimed that "production targets must be assigned to individuals to ensure completion." As a result, many strange things happened: workers were given five jiao each for unloading a truck during work hours. Consequently, there were fees left and right, only money was seen, not people, causing opposition between workers and workers, workshops and workshops, corrupting the workers' ideology, and encouraging many to take the path of technocracy.

	Third, they criticized the organizational structure that violated Chairman Mao's great directive of "streamlining administration and reducing personnel." The entire factory had only about sixty employees, but non-production personnel accounted for 26% of the total, amounting to sixteen people. The factory's structure was redundant, and many people were idle. Some people had been away from labor for a long time and did not approach the workers.

	During the revolutionary criticism, the workers always placed the study of Chairman Mao's works in the first position. They seriously studied Chairman Mao's series of great instructions on health work. Chairman Mao said: "The peasants—this is the main object of the cultural movement in the present stage in China. The so-called elimination of illiteracy, the so-called popularization of education, the so-called mass art, the so-called national health, all these things, if separated from the three hundred and sixty million peasants, would be largely empty talk." The workers compared this with the factory policy pushed by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party to serve a few lords, and they were all indignant. They excitedly said: "One aims to serve the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, putting the focus of health work in the countryside; the other aims to serve a few lords, putting the focus of health work in a few high-level hospitals. This is a struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. We, the workers and poor and lower-middle peasants, are heart to heart. We must stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and completely reverse the service direction." They immediately sent investigation teams to find out which medical equipment was most needed in the countryside at present. When they discovered that many places in the countryside used rice cookers instead of high-pressure sterilizers, which were not tightly sealed, they decided to produce high-pressure sterilizers as an important project. They also, according to the demands of the poor and lower-middle peasants, overcame numerous difficulties and successfully developed a small portable X-ray machine. Additionally, they organized three teams in a planned manner to go to county and district medical and health units for on-site repairs, which were warmly welcomed and praised by the broad masses of workers in rural medical units.

	The factory's revolutionary committee also mobilized the masses to reform the old leadership structure and management system, striving to benefit the masses and production. The revolutionary committee had seven members. Except for one person left each day to handle daily affairs, the others had all returned to their original production positions, insisting on fighting and producing with the masses.

### 坚决贯彻毛主席有关卫生工作的指示  狠批走资派的为少数老爷服务的方针

    坚决贯彻毛主席有关卫生工作的指示
    狠批走资派的为少数老爷服务的方针
    贵州医疗器械厂把革命的大批判同本单位的斗批改紧密结合，革命和生产出现了新局面
    本报讯　贵州省医疗器械厂无产阶级革命派掌权以后，抓住革命大批判这个纲，紧密结合本单位的斗批改，坚决贯彻毛主席有关卫生工作的指示，端正服务方向，促进了生产，促进了工作。
    这个工厂从正式投入生产那天起，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派就给它规定了一条主要为少数城市老爷服务的方向，说什么“保证贵阳这几个大医院的修理就行了”。而实际上，工厂的主要力量是集中在为党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派服务，给他们修理什么冷藏库、家用冰箱、钢丝床、收音机等。根据建厂十年来的这种情况，无产阶级革命派认为，必须以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，开展一场革命的大批判运动，彻底肃清反革命修正主义的流毒。
    这个厂的革命大批判是从批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这条资产阶级反动路线开始的。这个大批判，有力地促进了革命的大联合和“三结合”。紧接着又结合本厂的服务方向、经营管理等方面存在的修正主义流毒，着重批判了以下三个问题。
    一是批判只为少数老爷服务的办厂方针。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，顽固地抗拒毛主席对卫生工作的一系列伟大指示，在生产方面，根本不考虑农村需要，专为少数老爷服务。在服务态度方面，也是对少数老爷唯恐怠慢，不管手头有什么紧要工作，总是随叫随到。有一次都匀县医院从几百里路以外送来一只高压消毒器修理。这只消毒器本来只要花几分钟换一个压力表就行了，可是厂内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派却百般刁难，一直拖了三、四天才动手修理。
    二是批判“产销包给个人”的修正主义经营方式。厂内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派为了复辟资本主义，大搞物质刺激，胡说什么“产值落实到人，完成任务才有保证”。因此，许许多多怪事发生了：对工人在上班时间卸一车货，也给每人发五毛钱的“卸车费”。结果，左一个费，右一个费，只见钱，不见人，造成工人与工人，车间与车间的对立，腐蚀了职工的思想，助长了很多人走技术至上的白专道路。
    三是批判违反毛主席“精兵简政”这一伟大方针的体制设施。全厂仅有六十几个职工，而非生产人员却占全体职工的百分之二十六，达十六人之多。厂内机构重叠，人浮于事。有些人长期脱离劳动，不接近工人。
    在革命的大批判中，工人们自始至终都把学习毛主席著作摆在第一位。他们认真地学习毛主席有关卫生工作的一系列伟大指示。毛主席说：“农民——这是现阶段中国文化运动的主要对象。所谓扫除文盲，所谓普及教育，所谓大众文艺，所谓国民卫生，离开了三亿六千万农民，岂非大半成了空话？”工人们对比党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所极力推行的为少数老爷服务的办厂方针，个个义愤填膺。他们激动地说：“一个要为广大工农兵服务，把卫生工作的重点放到农村去；一个要为少数老爷服务，把卫生工作的重点放在几所高级医院。这就是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争。我们工人阶级和贫下中农心连心，坚决要站到毛主席的革命路线一边，彻底扭转服务方向。”他们马上派出调查组，调查目前农村最需要哪些医疗器械。当他们发现农村不少地方用饭甑代替高压消毒器，消毒不严密时，就决定将高压消毒器作为一项重要生产项目投入生产。他们还根据贫下中农的要求，克服重重困难，试制成功一种小型携带式爱克斯光机。另外，他们还有计划地组织了三批巡回检修队，深入到县、区医疗卫生单位巡回检修器械，受到农村医疗单位广大职工的热烈欢迎和赞扬。
    这个厂的革命委员会还发动群众对旧的领导机构和管理制度进行了改革，力争做到有利于群众，有利于生产。革委会共有七个委员，除每天留一人处理日常事务外，其他都已回到原生产岗位，坚持同群众战斗在一起，生产在一起。
