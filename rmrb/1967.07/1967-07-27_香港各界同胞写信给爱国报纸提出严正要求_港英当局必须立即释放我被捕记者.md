	Hong Kong compatriots from all walks of life have been writing to patriotic newspapers in recent days, strongly protesting the British colonial authorities' unjust "sentencing" of New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch reporter Xue Ping to two years in prison and the illegal arrest of reporters from the New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch, as well as the *Wen Wei Po*, *Ta Kung Pao*, and *Sing Tao Daily*. These actions are fascist atrocities.

	Hong Kong patriots have emphasized that the persecution of New China News Agency reporters and reporters from patriotic newspapers by the British colonial authorities is a serious provocation against the 400,000 Hong Kong compatriots and the 700 million Chinese people. We Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots absolutely cannot tolerate this.

	Some patriotic workers said: We sternly demand that the British colonial authorities immediately release the unjustly "sentenced" and illegally detained patriotic reporters, apologize and compensate for all damages, and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again.

	Some film workers said: The British colonial authorities' savage persecution of our patriotic reporters' normal reporting activities is an attempt to achieve the evil goal of blocking news. However, crows cannot cover the sun. The great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought will surely shine over the entire Hong Kong and Kowloon.

	Some bank employees said: We warn the British colonial authorities: They must immediately revoke the unjust "sentence" against our New China News Agency reporter Xue Ping and immediately release all illegally detained patriotic reporters. Otherwise, the British colonial authorities will be responsible for all consequences.

    香港各界同胞写信给爱国报纸提出严正要求
    港英当局必须立即释放我被捕记者
    据新华社香港二十六日电　连日来，香港各行各业工人、各界爱国同胞纷纷写信给爱国报纸，强烈抗议港英当局无理“判决”新华社香港分社记者薛平入狱两年和非法逮捕新华社香港分社以及《文汇报》、《大公报》、《新晚报》记者的法西斯暴行。
    香港爱国同胞强调指出，港英当局迫害新华社记者和爱国报纸记者，是对四百万香港同胞和七亿中国人民的严重挑衅，我们港九爱国同胞绝对不能容忍。
    一些爱国工人说：我们严正要求港英当局必须立即释放被无理“判刑”和非法拘捕的爱国记者，认错道歉，赔偿一切损失，并保证以后不再发生类似事件。
    一些电影工作者说：港英对我爱国记者的正常采访活动进行野蛮的迫害，企图以此达到封锁新闻的罪恶目的。但是，乌鸦是遮不住太阳的，伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想必将普照全港九。
    一些银行界职工说：我们警告港英：必须立即撤销对我新华社记者薛平的无理“判决”，并立即释放所有被非法拘捕的爱国记者，不然一切后果由港英负责。
