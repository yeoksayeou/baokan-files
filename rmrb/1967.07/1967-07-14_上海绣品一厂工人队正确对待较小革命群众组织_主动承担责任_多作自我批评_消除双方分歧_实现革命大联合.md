Shanghai Embroidery Factory No. 1 Workers' Team Correctly Deals with Smaller Revolutionary Mass Organizations

	Maintains Responsibility, Engages in Self-Criticism, Resolves Differences, Achieves Revolutionary Unity

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai: The revolutionary faction in charge of Shanghai Embroidery Factory No. 1, the Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps (abbreviated as the Workers' Team), actively studies and applies Chairman Mao's works. They correctly handle and deal with revolutionary mass organizations that hold different views, without discriminating or coercing, but instead using reason to persuade and resolving contradictions between both sides with the great thought of Mao Zedong. This has eliminated differences and achieved revolutionary unity.

	During the "January Revolution" storm, the Workers' Team seized power in their unit and bravely shouldered the dual responsibilities of revolution and production. Later, due to different opinions on the handling of some specific issues, a portion split off to form another group, the Artisans' Revolutionary Rebel Corps (abbreviated as the Artisans' Team). The two teams, once formed, attacked each other, picked on each other's minor faults, and neither side yielded, seriously affecting the revolution and production.

	The revolutionary masses in the factory sharply criticized the Workers' Team, which was in charge, and suggested that the two teams unite through criticism and self-criticism, under the premise of a unified broad direction, to jointly fight the enemy.

	After hearing these opinions, the Workers' Team began to calmly reflect on the issues. They studied Chairman Mao's teachings on distinguishing between enemies and friends and his brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." They conducted a serious analysis of the Artisans' Team. They looked at the Artisans' Team's broad direction and mainstream, and saw where they stood in the struggle between the two lines and two roads. They believed that the comrades in the Artisans' Team initially rebelled against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and came out with them; during the difficult period of suppression by the bourgeois reactionary line, they stood firmly with them. Therefore, the Artisans' Team is a revolutionary organization, and the contradictions between the two teams are contradictions among the people. The Workers' Team's past actions of sealing the Artisans' Team's office, seizing their seal, and ordering their dissolution were wrong. The Workers' Team also realized that they were the team in charge and the larger organization, and in the contradictions with the Artisans' Team, they were the main side. In eliminating the differences between the two teams and achieving revolutionary unity, they bore the main responsibility and should take an active attitude to unite with the Artisans' Team. They were not afraid of being cold-shouldered by the other side, actively approached the Artisans' Team members, and even went to the Artisans' Team leaders' homes to have heart-to-heart talks, exchanging views on unity. At that time, the Artisans' Team also had the demand for unity, but because they had been ordered to dissolve by the Workers' Team, they were unwilling to take the initiative to propose it. When the Workers' Team took the initiative to come knocking on their door, they also actively approached.

	However, after two discussions on unity, both sides did not succeed. In the discussions, they clung to each other's minor issues and dug up old accounts, and their emotions became confrontational again. After the meeting, some leaders and members of the Workers' Team were very impatient, saying, "The Artisans' Team has only twelve people; setting them aside doesn't affect the unity of ninety-five percent!" The majority of the Workers' Team's leaders and members believed that this thought was wrong and organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," the "Three Articles," and related articles from "Red Flag" and "People's Daily." They realized that the twelve people in the Artisans' Team are our class brothers. Initially, they split off because they were influenced by the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large group and protecting a small group" in the cadre issue. They were temporarily deceived, and we have the responsibility to help them move forward together.

	The Workers' Team summarized the lessons from the two unsuccessful discussions. They realized that although they took the initiative to discuss with the Artisans' Team, they did not truly put down their arrogance, did not first engage in self-criticism, and still regarded themselves as heroes, waiting for the other side to admit mistakes. Through self-examination, they corrected their attitude and decided to make a sincere self-criticism and correct their mistakes in action to contribute to the unity of the two teams.

	To create conditions for the third discussion on unity, the Workers' Team held a meeting to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line and actively invited the Artisans' Team members to the stage to criticize. Through the criticism, both sides realized that the bourgeois reactionary line was the root cause of their split, and now they should unite under the premise of a unified broad direction and jointly fight the enemy.

	Having found the root cause, raised awareness, and unified thoughts, the Workers' Team took the initiative to discuss unity with the Artisans' Team for the third time. At the meeting, the Workers' Team first conducted self-criticism. The Artisans' Team was moved by the Workers' Team's active, sincere, and patient attitude in helping comrades and also conducted serious self-criticism. Both sides eliminated misunderstandings and formed a unified revolutionary mass organization, the "Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps."

    上海绣品一厂工人队正确对待较小革命群众组织
    主动承担责任　多作自我批评  消除双方分歧　实现革命大联合
    据新华社上海电　上海绣品一厂掌权的革命派组织工人革命造反队（简称工人队），活学活用毛主席著作，正确对待和自己持有不同意见的较小的革命群众组织，不歧视，不压服，而是以理服人，用伟大的毛泽东思想来解决双方之间的矛盾，从而消除了分歧，实现了革命的大联合。
    工人队在“一月革命”风暴中夺了本单位的权，勇敢地挑起了革命和生产两副重担。后来，由于在一些具体问题的处理上产生了不同的意见，一部分人分裂出去，另外成立了工艺工人革命造反队（简称工艺队）。两个队一出现，就相互攻击，相互揪小辫子，各不相让，严重影响了革命和生产。
    工厂革命群众向掌权的工人队提出了尖锐的批评，并且建议两个队通过批评与自我批评，在大方向一致的前提下联合起来，共同对敌。
    工人队听了这些意见以后，开始坐下来冷静地思考问题。他们学习了毛主席关于分清敌友我的教导和《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这篇光辉著作，对工艺队作了认真分析。他们看工艺队的大方向和主流，看他们在两条路线、两条道路的斗争中究竟站在哪一边。他们认为，工艺队的同志一开始就是为造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，而和自己一道杀出来的；在资产阶级反动路线压制的困难时期，又和自己坚定地站在一起。因此，工艺队是革命的组织，两队之间的矛盾是人民内部矛盾。工人队过去对工艺队采取封办公室、夺他们的公章、勒令他们解散等做法，是错误的。工人队还认识到，自己是掌权的队，又是大组织，在和工艺队的矛盾中，自己是矛盾的主要方面。在消除两队的分歧，实现革命大联合中，自己负有主要责任，应该采取积极的态度，主动去联合工艺队。他们不怕受到对方的冷遇，主动接近工艺队的同志，甚至到工艺队队委家里谈心，交换对大联合的看法。当时，工艺队也有大联合的要求，但因为曾被工人队勒令解散过，不愿主动提出。当工人队主动找上门来时，他们也就积极靠拢。
    可是，双方经过两次座谈联合问题，都没有成功。在座谈会上，互相揪住对方一些枝节问题不放，而且翻出老账，情绪又对立起来。会后，工人队的个别队委和队员很不耐烦，有的说：“工艺队总共才十二个人，把他们放在一边也不影响团结百分之九十五！”工人队大多数队委和队员认为这种思想是错误的，于是又组织大家学习了毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、
  “老三篇”等光辉著作，以及《红旗》、《人民日报》的有关文章。他们认识到，工艺队的十二个人是我们的阶级弟兄，当初他们所以分裂出去，是受了在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线的影响，他们是一时受了蒙蔽，我们有责任帮助他们共同前进。
    工人队总结了两次座谈不成功的教训。他们认识到：自己虽然主动找工艺队座谈，但是没有真正放下架子，没有首先作自我批评，仍然以功臣自居，等着人家承认错误。通过检查，他们端正了态度，决心以认真的自我批评和改正错误的实际行动，为两个队的联合作出贡献。
    为了给第三次大联合座谈创造条件，工人队召开了一次批判资产阶级反动路线的大会，主动邀请工艺队的同志上台批判。通过批判，双方认识到资产阶级反动路线是使他们走向分裂的根子，如今应该在大方向一致的前提下，团结起来，共同对敌。
    根子找到了，认识提高了，思想统一了，工人队第三次主动地找了工艺队进行有关大联合的座谈。会上，工人队首先进行了自我批评。工艺队为工人队那种积极主动、耐心帮助同志的诚恳态度所感动，也认真地作了自我批评。双方消除了隔阂，成立了统一的革命群众组织“工人革命造反大队”。
