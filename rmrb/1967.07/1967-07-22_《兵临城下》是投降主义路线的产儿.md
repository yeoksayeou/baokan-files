The reactionary film "The Enemy at the Gate" is based on the liberation of Changchun by our army and fabricates a ridiculous story.

During the War of Liberation, the Kuomintang adopted a counter-revolutionary two-faced policy of "fake peace, real war." While chanting the "peace scripture," they held the "extermination order" in their hands, launching large-scale attacks on the liberated areas and sparking a full-scale civil war. Chairman Mao timely exposed the Kuomintang reactionaries' peace smokescreen and proposed the policy of "fighting back tooth and nail, not giving up an inch of land." Just as the Chinese people were following Chairman Mao's teachings and fighting a bloody battle, China's Khrushchev hysterically shouted: "The period of peace and democracy is not about brandishing the gun but about 'votes,' 'negotiations,' and 'parliaments' to solve problems." This is a thorough and complete line of capitulationism.

The reactionary film "The Enemy at the Gate" is a product of China's Khrushchev's capitulationist line. The film, in order to oppose Chairman Mao's people's war theory and armed seizure of power, defames the People's Liberation Army, and deliberately distorts the image of our enemy work department director Jiang. It repeatedly uses Jiang's mouth to say what China's Khrushchev wants to say: "Mountains and rivers block the way, but flowers bloom behind the willows." What is the intention behind these words? It means that the enemy is "wise" and can "enlighten" themselves. When the enemy feels there is "no way out," they will suddenly realize the truth, change their nature, and voluntarily take the path of "spring sunshine." What is this nonsense? This is completely picked up from the Soviet Khrushchev's trash. Didn't Khrushchev say that "peace" should be entrusted to the "wisdom" of imperialism? Didn't he say that when imperialism becomes "wise," world "peace" will come? The director and screenwriter dare not openly advocate Khrushchev's fallacies, so they use subtle methods, using the two lines of poetry by Lu You: "Mountains and rivers block the way, but flowers bloom behind the willows" to advocate for Khrushchev.

The film, according to this reactionary logic, extensively propagates our army's policy of reforming the enemy. When our army captured the enemy brigade commander Zheng Hanshen and his wife, Zheng Hanshen was very arrogant and stubborn, saying: "Failure means death, kill me if you must, execute me if you must! I will never surrender." For such a blood-stained, unrepentant counter-revolutionary, the Communist Party's policy is to firmly strike and show no mercy. But Director Jiang comforted him, saying: "Our policy is not to kill prisoners, you probably don't doubt that, right?" He treated this war criminal warmly and with great care, not only arranging for Zheng Hanshen to be safely escorted across the river but also promising to find the infant lost in the war. The film, after defaming our party cadres, goes to great lengths to design a close-up shot: When Zheng Hanshen bids farewell to Director Jiang, their two large hands are tightly clasped together, so comfortably, so affectionately. China's Khrushchev's "class collaboration theory" is vividly displayed here. What class struggle, what class hatred, all vanish into thin air with this handshake.

To further defame the People's Liberation Army, the film spares no effort in portraying our army as weak and helpless, completely led by the nose by the enemy. When the enemy brigade commander Zhao Chongwu plays with "negotiations," he says, "If the Communist army is sincere, why not send a responsible person into the city to talk?" Soon after, Director Jiang, holding Zheng Hanshen's infant, indeed appears before the enemy. Zheng Hanshen and his wife, seeing the infant, are very moved. Under this "sentiment of returning the child," they become "wise." Director Jiang, in front of the enemy, calls them "commander" and "friend" left and right, and shamelessly says: "Coming to Commander Zheng's house as a guest, who dares to touch me?" This image of Director Jiang, who trades principles, is the incarnation of China's Khrushchev.

Even more vilely, the film does not expose the Kuomintang reactionaries' anti-communist, anti-people crimes but instead, through Director Jiang's mouth, extensively beautifies the Kuomintang reactionaries. During the talks, Director Jiang flatteringly tells Zhao Chongwu: "As old friends, I should speak frankly. Our army has not yet attacked the city... We also cherish your army's glorious history in the Northern Expedition and the War of Resistance." If we follow this extremely reactionary logic, isn't this saying that the victory of the Northern Expedition is the merit of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and the victory of the War of Resistance is also the merit of the Kuomintang reactionaries? This is strikingly similar to what China's Khrushchev said, "The entire Chinese nation has persisted in the war of resistance until the final victory, and Jiang has merits!" This completely covers up the Kuomintang's reactionary nature of fake resistance, true anti-communism, fake patriotism, and true treason.

From this reactionary logic, in the end, the Kuomintang brigade commander Zheng Hanshen indeed holds a pistol, pointing it at Hu Gaochan, saying: "Yes! It is to oppose you in creating civil war, to oppose you in selling China to the Americans, understand?" Here, a butcher with blood on both hands suddenly transforms into a patriot and a hero "opposing the Americans and Chiang." The director and screenwriter, to fully advocate China's Khrushchev's capitulationist line and the magical charm of "humanity reform," in the film's ending, our army does not move a blade, relying only on the "wise" uprising of Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanshen, this group of enemies, to eliminate another group of enemies, achieving "flowers bloom behind the willows." Thus, the fallacy of China's Khrushchev that "the period of peace and democracy is not about brandishing the gun" is derived.

The problem is clear: "The Enemy at the Gate" is completely a monster created according to China's Khrushchev's capitulationist theory. It is diametrically opposed to Chairman Mao's great thought of people's war, armed struggle, and "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." Chairman Mao repeatedly teaches us that if our army does not have an extremely powerful military offensive and political offensive, the enemy will never have the kindness to surrender. "All reactionary things, if you do not beat them, they will not fall." The enemy is "to make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they perish." But the reactionary film "The Enemy at the Gate" extensively advocates that the enemy can "lay down their butcher's knife and become a Buddha instantly"; extensively advocates that revolution is not about armed seizure of power but about the "wise" uprising within the enemy to solve problems; extensively advocates "humanity reform" and "class collaboration." The purpose is to advocate China's Khrushchev's capitulationist line, to oppose the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, to beautify the Kuomintang and all reactionaries, to numb the people's fighting spirit, to relax the people's vigilance, to cancel the armed struggle of the oppressed people and oppressed nations, and to prepare public opinion for China's Khrushchev to promote the revisionist line. No wonder after this poisonous reactionary film was released, the biggest clique of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road cheered for it!

The surging torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution rolls on. Today, the Chinese people, armed with the great Mao Zedong Thought, have already sharpened their eyes and, with indomitable rage, pulled China's Khrushchev down from his horse. We must pursue victory, cut off his black hands reaching into the political, economic, and cultural domains, and thoroughly purge all the poison he has spread! Let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought be planted in every domain! Let it be planted in every position!

    《兵临城下》是投降主义路线的产儿
    师文兵
    反动影片《兵临城下》，是以我军解放长春为背景，编造出来的一个荒唐的故事。
    解放战争时期，国民党采取了“假和平，真备战”的反革命两面政策，口里念着“和平经”，手里拿着“剿匪令”，大肆向解放区进攻，挑起了全面性的国内战争。毛主席及时地揭穿了国民党反动派的和平烟幕，提出了“针锋相对，寸土必争”的方针。正当中国人民遵循毛主席教导进行浴血斗争的时候，中国赫鲁晓夫却歇斯底里地叫喊：“和平民主时期不是靠枪杆子逞锋”，而是靠“选票”、靠“和谈”、靠“议会”解决问题。这是彻头彻尾的投降主义路线。
    反动影片《兵临城下》，就是中国赫鲁晓夫投降主义路线的产儿。影片为了反对毛主席的人民战争思想，反对武装夺取政权，丑化人民解放军，极力歪曲我敌工部姜部长的形象，把中国赫鲁晓夫要说的话，反复地借姜部长之口说出来：“山重水复疑无路，柳暗花明又一村”。这句话的用意何在？就是说敌人是“明智”的，是可以“觉悟”的，等敌人感到“无路”可走的时候，他们就会大彻大悟，改其本性，自动地走上一条“春光明媚”的道路。这是什么货色？这完全是从苏联赫鲁晓夫那里拣来的破烂。赫鲁晓夫不是说要把“和平”寄托在帝国主义的“明智”上吗？不是说过什么等到帝国主义“明智”了，世界“和平”就会到来吗？编导者不敢明目张胆地宣扬赫鲁晓夫的谬论，就采用了隐晦的手段，用陆游的两句诗：“山重水复疑无路，柳暗花明又一村”来为赫鲁晓夫张目。
    影片正是按照这个反动逻辑，大肆渲染我军的感化政策。当我军俘虏了敌军团长郑汉臣和他的老婆时，郑汉臣非常嚣张，顽固地说：“不成功便成仁，要杀就杀，要毙就毙！”“决不投降”。对于这样一个血债累累死不回头的反革命分子，共产党的政策是坚决打击，毫不留情。而姜部长却安抚地说：“我们的政策不杀俘虏，这你大概不怀疑吧？”他对这个战犯热情招待，关怀备至，不但派人把郑汉臣安全护送过江，而且还满口答应给他寻找战乱中丢失的婴儿。影片这样污辱了我党干部还嫌不够，接着，又煞费苦心地设计了一个特写镜头：当郑汉臣临别姜部长时，两双大手紧紧握在一起，那么惬意，那么深情，中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级合作论”在这里形象地展现出来，什么阶级斗争，阶级仇恨，在这一握手中，都烟消云散，无影无踪了。
    影片为了丑化我人民解放军，还不遗余力地把我军写得软弱无能，束手无策，完全让敌人牵着我们的鼻子走。当敌军师长赵崇武玩弄“和谈”时说，共军如果有诚意，“为什么不派一个负责人进城来谈谈呢？”过了不久，姜部长就抱着郑汉臣的婴儿，果然出现在敌人面前。郑汉臣和他老婆见到婴儿非常感动，在这种“送子之情”的感化下，他们就“明智”起来了。姜部长在敌人面前左一个“长官”，又一个“朋友”，并且还恬不知耻地说：“到郑团长家里来作客，谁敢动我？”这个拿着原则作交易的姜部长的形象，就是中国赫鲁晓夫的化身。
    更恶毒的是影片非但不去揭露国民党反动派反共反人民的滔天罪行，相反，却通过姜部长之口大肆美化国民党反动派。在会谈中，姜部长肉麻地对赵崇武说：“做为老朋友，我应该直言奉告，我军所以迟迟不攻城……我们也珍惜贵军在北伐和抗日时期，这两段光荣历史。”如果按照这个反动透顶的逻辑去推理，这岂不是说，北伐战争的胜利是国民党反动派的功劳，抗日战争的胜利也是国民党反动派的功劳吗？这和中国赫鲁晓夫所说“中国全民族一直坚持抗战以至于最后胜利，蒋是有功的”相比，是何其相似乃尔！这完全掩盖了国民党假抗日、真反共，假爱国、真卖国的反动本质。
    从这个反动的逻辑出发，最后，国民党团长郑汉臣果然手持手枪，对准胡高参说：“对！就是要反对你们制造内战，反对你们把中国卖给美国人，懂吗？”在这里，一个双手沾满人民鲜血的刽子手，竟然一变而成了“爱国爱民”的志士、“反美、反蒋”的“英雄”。编导者为了尽力鼓吹中国赫鲁晓夫的投降主义路线，鼓吹“人性感化”的神奇魅力，在影片的结局，我军没动一刀一枪，只靠赵崇武和郑汉臣这股敌人“明智”起义，消灭了另一股敌人，实现了“柳暗花明又一村”。因而就得出了中国赫鲁晓夫“和平民主时期不是靠枪杆子逞锋”的谬论。
    问题再清楚不过了，《兵临城下》完全是根据中国赫鲁晓夫投降主义理论炮制出来的怪胎。它与毛主席的人民战争，武装斗争，“枪杆子里面出政权”的伟大思想是庭径相背的。毛主席一再教导我们，如果我军没有无比强大的军事攻势和政治攻势，敌人是决不会发善心投降的。“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”敌人是“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡”。而反动影片《兵临城下》却大肆宣扬敌人可以“放下屠刀，立地成佛”；大肆宣扬革命不是靠武装夺取政权，而是靠敌人内部的“明智”起义解决问题；大肆宣扬“人性感化”、“阶级合作”。其目的就是鼓吹中国赫鲁晓夫的投降路线，就是反对光焰无际的毛泽东思想，美化国民党和一切反动派，以此来麻痹人民的斗志，松懈人民的警惕，取消被压迫人民和被压迫民族的武装斗争，为中国赫鲁晓夫推行修正主义路线作舆论准备。难怪这部浸满毒汁的反动影片出笼之后，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派为之捧场喝采呵！
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流汹涌澎湃，滚滚向前。今天，用伟大毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民早已擦亮了眼睛，满怀不可遏制的怒火把中国的赫鲁晓夫拉下了马。我们一定要乘胜追击，把他伸向政治、经济、文化等领域内的黑手斩断，把它散布的一切流毒全部地、彻底地肃清！让伟大的毛泽东思想红旗插遍一切领域！插遍一切阵地吧！
