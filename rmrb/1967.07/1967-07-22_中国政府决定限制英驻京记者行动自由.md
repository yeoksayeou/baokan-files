The British government and the Hong Kong authorities' serious political provocation cannot be tolerated

The Chinese government decides to restrict the freedom of movement of British journalists in Beijing

The News Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, authorized, announced to Reuters correspondent Gray: Starting from the 21st, he is not allowed to leave his residence at will and must await further instructions; at the same time, the previously issued entry and exit visas for him are revoked. If he does not obediently follow the Chinese government's decision, he will bear all serious consequences.

New China News Agency, July 21st: In the afternoon of the 21st, the News Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, authorized, summoned the Reuters correspondent in Beijing, Gray, and solemnly announced that due to the illegal persecution of our New China News Agency's Hong Kong branch journalists and other patriotic journalists by British imperialism, the Chinese government has decided to restrict Gray's freedom of movement, not allowing him to leave his residence at will, and to await further instructions. The responsible personnel of the News Department pointed out that in recent times, the British government and the Hong Kong authorities, disregarding the serious warnings of the Chinese government, have become increasingly savage and frenzied in their fascist suppression of our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. It is particularly worth noting that the Hong Kong authorities have unreasonably abducted, brutally beaten, and illegally "interrogated" our New China News Agency's Hong Kong branch journalist Xue Ping, and brazenly sentenced him to two years in prison on trumped-up charges on the 19th. The Hong Kong authorities have also unreasonably abducted New China News Agency's Hong Kong branch journalists Chen Fengying, Chen Demu, and five other patriotic journalists, subjecting them to illegal "interrogations." This is a serious political provocation by the British government and the Hong Kong authorities against the Chinese people, which is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people. The News Department, authorized, announced that due to the British government and the Hong Kong authorities' disregard for the serious warnings of our government and their repeated deliberate persecution of our New China News Agency's Hong Kong branch journalists and five other patriotic journalists, even illegally "sentencing" them, the Chinese government deems it necessary to take the following measures against the Reuters correspondent in Beijing, Gray: Starting today, his freedom of movement will be restricted, he will not be allowed to leave his residence at will, and he must await further instructions; at the same time, the previously issued entry and exit visas for him are revoked.

The responsible personnel of the News Department sternly warned Gray: You must obediently follow this decision of the Chinese government; otherwise, all serious consequences arising therefrom will be your own responsibility.

    我外交部新闻司受权向路透社记者格雷郑重宣布：自二十一日起，不准擅自离开住所，听候处理；同时取消以前发给他的出入境签证。若不老老实实遵守中国政府决定，将承担一切严重后果。
    新华社二十一日讯　二十一日下午外交部新闻司受权召见英国路透社驻京记者格雷，郑重宣布，由于英帝国主义非法迫害我新华社香港分社记者和其他爱国记者，中国政府决定限制格雷的行动自由，不准他擅自离开住所，要他听候处理。新闻司负责人员指出，最近以来英国政府和港英当局不顾中国政府的严重警告，越来越野蛮和疯狂地对我香港爱国同胞进行法西斯镇压。特别要指出的是，港英当局竟然无理绑架、残酷毒打、非法“审讯”我新华社香港分社记者薛平，并悍然于十九日以莫须有的罪名无理“判决”薛平入狱两年。港英当局还无理绑架了新华社香港分社记者陈凤英、陈德穆和其他五名爱国记者，对他们进行非法“审讯”。这是英国政府和港英当局对中国人民的严重政治挑衅，是中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。新闻司受权宣布，由于英国政府和港英当局不顾我国政府的严重警告，一再蓄意对我新华社香港分社记者和其他五名爱国记者横加迫害，甚至非法“判刑”，中国政府认为有必要对英国路透社驻京记者格雷采取以下措施：自今日起限制格雷行动自由，不准擅自离开住所，听候处理；同时取消以前发给他的出入境签证。
    新闻司负责人严正警告格雷：你必须老老实实遵守中国政府的这一决定，否则由此而引起的一切严重后果，将由你自己承担。
