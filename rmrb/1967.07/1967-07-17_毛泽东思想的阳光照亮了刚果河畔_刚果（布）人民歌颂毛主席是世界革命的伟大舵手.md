Our great leader Chairman Mao is deeply loved by the revolutionary peoples of the whole world, and the brilliant rays of Mao Zedong Thought illuminate the globe. On the banks of the Congo River in Africa, the people of Congo (Brazzaville) express their deepest feelings and most beautiful words to show their boundless admiration for Chairman Mao and their heartfelt love for Chairman Mao's works.

The sea voyage needs a helmsman

Not long ago, at a farewell banquet held for three Chinese experts returning home, Commander Diawara of the Congolese (Brazzaville) People's Militia said: "Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Mao Zedong Thought not only illuminates the revolutionary path of the Chinese people but also illuminates the revolutionary path of the Congolese people. Mao Zedong is the great helmsman of the world revolution." Another leader of the People's Militia, Ndala, said in his toast: "We all know that a sea voyage needs a helmsman. The helmsman of the world revolution is Mao Zedong."

Nearly a hundred male and female leaders and members of the People's Militia attending the banquet shouted in both Chinese and Congolese languages: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!"

The "Lumumba Camp" of the People's Militia held a celebration meeting with over five hundred participants to commemorate the victory over the imperialist plot to overthrow the government last June. Next to the chairman's platform, a member of the People's Militia held up a half-man-high placard. On the placard, there was a colored portrait of Chairman Mao, and below it was written: "The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the Congolese people's struggle." A member of the People's Militia named Michel said: "Chairman Mao has given us the revolutionary thought. He is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the people of the world."

Not long ago, a training class in the "Sacrifice Camp" of the People's Militia was concluded. A member of the People's Militia who performed excellently received a copy of "Selected Works of Mao Zedong" as a reward. He happily said: "This is the highest reward. Now I have two weapons: one is an automatic rifle to fight the enemy, and the other is the ideological weapon to guide me in fighting the enemy—Mao Zedong Thought. I will always carry Mao Zedong's works with me."

Chairman Mao is beckoning to us

A local artist in Brazzaville, to express his love for Chairman Mao, recently spent four days painting a large oil portrait of Chairman Mao beckoning to the revolutionary masses.

The artist said: "I got a Chinese magazine and saw a photo of Chairman Mao beckoning to the Chinese revolutionary masses. I was very excited. Chairman Mao, he is the hope of the oppressed people for complete liberation, and his thought is the lighthouse guiding mankind to happiness."

He said: "At first, I didn't have the courage to paint this large portrait. My young neighbors encouraged me to paint a big one so that passersby could see Chairman Mao beckoning to us."

A large colored portrait of Chairman Mao is prominently displayed on the building of the Chinese Embassy in Congo (Brazzaville). Every day, countless Congolese people passing by the embassy look up at Chairman Mao's great image; countless people have shouted "Mao Zedong," "Long live Chairman Mao!" from the bottom of their hearts to express their boundless respect and love for Chairman Mao. One day, a group of demonstrators passed by the embassy, and they shouted in front of Chairman Mao's portrait: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live the People's Republic of China!"

"The Quotations from Chairman Mao" is priceless

One day in May, a Congolese (Kinshasa) friend was walking on the streets of Brazzaville with a red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in his hand. A stranger from the interior of Congo (Brazzaville) walking towards him pointed to the red book in his hand and asked: "Do you sell this red book?" The Congolese (Kinshasa) friend replied: "This is mine." The stranger looked a bit disappointed and explained: "I just went to the bookstore, and all the red books are sold out. It's not easy to come to the capital from the interior, you can buy it in the capital in the future." The Congolese (Kinshasa) friend looked at the stranger and was very moved. He said: "The 'Quotations from Chairman Mao' is priceless. You need this precious book very much, I can give it to you."

The person from the interior of Congo (Brazzaville) was overjoyed and held the hand of his stranger friend for a long time, repeatedly saying: "Thank you, thank you. With the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' I can leave the capital."

After telling this story to a Chinese friend, the Congolese (Kinshasa) friend said: "The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought shines in every corner. The works of Chairman Mao are loved by all revolutionary people."

Wearing Chairman Mao's badge on the chest, the red sun rises in the heart, the red sun is the great Chairman Mao. The people of Congo (Brazzaville) have boundless love and admiration for you.

    毛泽东思想的阳光照亮了刚果河畔
    刚果（布）人民歌颂毛主席是世界革命的伟大舵手
    新华社布拉柴维尔十五日电　我们伟大的领袖毛主席得到全世界革命人民的衷心爱戴，光芒万丈的毛泽东思想普照全球。在非洲刚果河畔，刚果（布）人民以最真挚的感情、最美好的语言来表达他们对毛主席的无限敬仰，对毛主席著作的衷心热爱。
    大海航行靠舵手
    不久前，刚果（布）民卫团司令迪阿瓦拉在为即将返国的三名中国援外专家举行的告别酒会上讲话说：“毛泽东是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。毛泽东思想不仅照亮了中国人民的革命道路，而且也照亮着刚果人民的革命道路。毛泽东是世界革命的伟大舵手。”民卫团另一位负责人恩达拉在祝酒时说：“我们大家都知道，大海航行靠舵手。世界革命的舵手就是毛泽东。”
    出席酒会的近百名男女民卫团负责人及其成员用中、刚两国语言连声高呼：“毛主席万岁！毛主席万岁！”
    民卫团“卢蒙巴兵营”为纪念去年六月反对帝国主义颠覆阴谋的胜利，举行了一次有五百多人参加的庆祝大会。在大会主席台旁，一位民卫团成员双手举着一个半人高的标语牌，标语牌上侧是一幅毛主席的彩色画像，下面写着：“毛泽东思想的光辉照亮了刚果人民斗争的道路”。一位名叫米歇尔的民卫团成员说：“毛主席给了我们革命的思想，他不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是世界人民的伟大领袖。”
    不久前，民卫团“牺牲兵营”内举办的一个训练班结业了。一位成绩优良的民卫团团员得到的奖品是《毛泽东选集》。他高兴地说：“这是最高的奖赏。现在我有了两件武器：一件是打敌人的自动步枪，另一件是指导我打敌人的思想武器——毛泽东思想。毛泽东著作将永远带在我身边。”
    毛主席在向我们招手
    布拉柴维尔一位业余画家为了表达对毛主席的热爱，最近花了四天时间，临摹了一幅毛主席向革命群众亲切招手的大油画。
    这位画家说：“我得到了一本中国画报，看到毛主席向中国革命群众亲切招手的照片，心情非常激动。毛主席，他是被压迫人民争取彻底解放的希望，他的思想是照亮人类走向幸福的灯塔。”
    他说：“起初，我还没有勇气画这张大幅的像，街坊青年同伴们鼓舞我画张大的，让过路的人都能看到毛主席向我们招手。”
    中国驻刚果（布）使馆大楼上高挂着一幅毛主席彩色画像。每天，不知道有多少经过使馆门前的刚果人抬头凝视着毛主席的伟大形象；也不知道有多少人，有过多少次从他们的心底里喊出“毛泽东”、“毛主席万岁！”，来倾吐他们对毛主席的无限崇敬和爱戴。一天一支群众游行队伍走过使馆门前，他们在毛主席画像前振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“人民中国万岁！”
    《毛主席语录》是无价之宝
    五月的一天，一位刚果（金）朋友手里拿着一本红彤彤的《毛主席语录》在布拉柴维尔大街上行走，对面走来一位刚从刚果（布）内地来到首都的陌生人，指着他手里的那本红宝书问道：“你的红宝书卖不卖？”这位刚果（金）朋友回答说：“这是我自己用的。”陌生人有点失望，他解释说：“我刚到过书店，那里的红宝书全卖完了，从内地来一趟首都不容易啊，你在首都，将来还可以买到。”刚果（金）朋友打量着这位陌生人，心里很感动。他说：“《毛主席语录》是无价之宝，你非常需要这本宝书，我可以赠送给你。”
    这位来自刚果（布）内地的人高兴极了，久久地握住他那素不相识的朋友的手，一再说：“谢谢，谢谢。有了《毛主席语录》，我就可以离开首都了。”
    这位刚果（金）朋友在对中国朋友叙述完了他遇到的这件事后，他说：“毛泽东思想的光辉照耀到了每个角落。毛主席的著作，革命人民人人爱读。”（附图片）
    胸前挂起毛主席像章，心中升起最红最红的红太阳，红太阳就是伟大的毛主席，刚果（布）人民对您无限热爱和敬仰。
