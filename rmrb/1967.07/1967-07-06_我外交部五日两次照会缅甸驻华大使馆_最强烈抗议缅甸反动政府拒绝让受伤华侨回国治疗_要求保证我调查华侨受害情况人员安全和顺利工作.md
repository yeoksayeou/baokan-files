The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China summoned the Burmese Ambassador to China, Sin Wa Naung, on the evening of July 5, and handed him a note from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The note strongly protested the Burmese reactionary government's unreasonable refusal to allow injured overseas Chinese to return to China for treatment. It also pointed out that if the Burmese government continues to create obstacles, it will not end well!

The note stated: In the recent anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese fascist atrocities orchestrated by the Burmese government, many patriotic overseas Chinese were killed and injured by Burmese thugs. The Burmese government owes a blood debt to the Chinese government and people, which must be repaid.

The note said: The Chinese government is deeply concerned about the injured overseas Chinese. It decided to have Chinese civilian aircraft transport the patriotic overseas Chinese, who were severely injured by thugs organized and protected by the Burmese government, back to China for treatment. This decision was communicated to the Burmese government through the Chinese Embassy in Burma on July 3. However, the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in a note to the Chinese Embassy in Burma on July 4, unreasonably refused to allow the injured overseas Chinese to return to China for treatment. This is unacceptable to the Chinese government, and the Chinese government strongly protests against the Burmese government.

The note said: The Burmese government's note even claimed that "before the relevant issues regarding the current crisis are resolved, we cannot allow them to leave Burma," attempting to blame the Burmese government's anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese atrocities on the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese. This is a political conspiracy by the Burmese government to further cruelly persecute overseas Chinese. It must be pointed out that these despicable tricks not only deceive the broad masses of patriotic overseas Chinese but also deceive the people of China and Burma, and only further expose your inhuman fascist true colors.

The note concluded by stating that the Chinese government has decided to have a Chinese civilian aircraft transport a batch of injured overseas Chinese back to China for treatment on July 10. The Chinese government demands that the Burmese government immediately issue entry and exit visas for the seriously injured overseas Chinese who will return to China for treatment and make all necessary arrangements for their smooth departure. If the Burmese government ignores this decision by the Chinese government and continues to create obstacles, it will only show that the Burmese government is acting recklessly and is willing to play the fool in anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese activities, which will not end well!

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China summoned the Burmese Ambassador to China, Sin Wa Naung, on the evening of July 5, and handed him a note from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Chinese government, in the note, demanded that the Burmese government must guarantee the safety and smooth work of personnel dispatched by the Chinese Embassy in Burma to investigate the situation of injured and damaged overseas Chinese in Yangon's overseas Chinese residential areas.

The note said: Recently, the Burmese government has planned and carried out crazy anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese fascist atrocities, inflicting brutal large-scale arson, looting, arrests, and massacres on the broad masses of overseas Chinese, causing serious losses to the lives and property of the broad masses of overseas Chinese. This blood debt must be repaid by the Burmese government. The Chinese government has strongly protested this many times. The Chinese government must protect the legitimate rights and interests of overseas Chinese and has decided to immediately dispatch personnel from the Chinese Embassy in Burma to investigate the situation of injured and damaged overseas Chinese in Yangon's overseas Chinese residential areas. The Chinese government demands that the Burmese government must guarantee the safety and smooth work of the personnel from the Chinese Embassy.

　　我外交部五日两次照会缅甸驻华大使馆
　　最强烈抗议缅甸反动政府拒绝让受伤华侨回国治疗
　　要求保证我调查华侨受害情况人员安全和顺利工作
    新华社五日讯　中华人民共和国外交部第一亚洲司负责人，五日晚间召见缅甸驻华大使信瓦瑙，交给他一份中国外交部的照会。照会对缅甸反动政府竟然无理拒绝让被它组织暴徒打伤的华侨回国治疗，提出最强烈的抗议，并且指出，如果缅甸政府继续刁难，那是绝不会有好下场的！
    照会指出：在最近缅甸政府一手制造的反华排华法西斯暴行中，大批爱国华侨被缅甸暴徒残杀和打伤。缅甸政府对中国政府和中国人民欠下的这笔血债一定要偿还。
    照会说：中国政府十分关怀受害华侨，曾决定由中国民航班机接运被缅甸政府组织和包庇的暴徒毒打身负重伤的爱国侨胞返回中国进行治疗，并已于七月三日将这一决定通过中国驻缅甸大使馆通知了缅甸政府。但是缅甸政府外交部在七月四日给中国驻缅甸大使馆的照会中竟然无理拒绝让受伤华侨回国治疗。这是中国政府绝对不能答应的，中国政府向缅甸政府提出最强烈抗议。
    照会说：缅甸政府在来照中竟说什么“在有关目前危机的事项得到解决前，我们不能允许他们离开缅甸”，企图把缅甸政府的反华排华暴行嫁祸于广大爱国华侨。这是缅甸政府进一步残酷迫害华侨的政治阴谋。必须严正指出，你们这些卑鄙伎俩不但欺骗不了广大爱国华侨，更欺骗不了中缅两国人民，而只能更加暴露你们惨无人道的法西斯真面目。
    照会最后说，中国政府现决定由七月十日的中国民航班机接运一批受伤华侨返回中国治疗。中国政府要求缅甸政府立即发给即将回国治疗的身负重伤的华侨出入缅甸的来回签证，并为他们的顺利出境作出一切安排。如果缅甸政府无视中国政府这一决定，继续刁难，那就只能说明缅甸政府一意孤行，甘当反华排华的小丑，那是绝不会有好下场的！
    新华社五日讯　中华人民共和国外交部第一亚洲司负责人五日晚间召见缅甸驻华大使信瓦瑙，交给他一份中国外交部的照会。中国政府在照会中要求缅甸政府对中国驻缅甸大使馆派出前往仰光华侨居住地区调查华侨受害和损失情况的人员，必须保证他们的安全和顺利工作。
    照会说：最近缅甸政府策划和制造疯狂反华排华法西斯暴行，对广大华侨进行残酷的大焚烧、大抢劫、大逮捕、大屠杀，致使广大华侨生命财产遭受严重的牺牲和损失，这笔血债缅甸政府是必须偿还的。中国政府对此已多次提出最紧急最强烈的抗议。中国政府一定要保护华侨的正当权益，现决定由中国驻缅甸大使馆立即派出人员前往仰光华侨居住地区调查华侨受害和损失情况。中国政府要求缅甸政府必须保证中国大使馆人员的安全和顺利工作。
