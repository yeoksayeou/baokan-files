The workers of Hong Kong have risen up. After twenty trade unions held a joint strike, all the seamen in Hong Kong have declared that they will refuse to transport goods in and out of Hong Kong. A new and larger wave of struggle is surging forward, like a giant wave from the South China Sea, striking a heavy blow against the reactionary rule of British imperialism in Hong Kong.

British imperialism is the sworn enemy of the Chinese people. For over a hundred years, this old imperialist power has committed countless atrocities in China, leaving a deep debt of blood. They colluded with Chinese reactionaries, turning old China into a living hell. In Shanghai, on Chinese soil, they established concessions, set up police forces, exploited and oppressed the people, and ran amok, committing every conceivable evil. The waters of the Huangpu River cannot wash away the deep hatred and tears of the Shanghai people for imperialism.

Our Yangshupu Power Plant was originally established by British imperialists. In 1924, I came to work in this factory. It was not like a factory at all; it was more like a living hell where people were eaten and their blood was drunk. Many workers entered alive and left dead. I personally witnessed a worker shoveling coal near the coal hopper. Due to the lack of safety measures, he accidentally fell into the coal hopper. We could see the large piles of coal falling and burying his body. We workers urgently requested that the British boss stop the furnace to rescue him. The heartless British devils did not allow it, and this worker was suffocated to death in the coal bunker.

These bloody facts and blood-stained pictures, the Chinese people will never forget. We must keep this deep hatred firmly in our hearts.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The process of imperialism and Chinese feudalism combining to turn China into a semi-colony and colony is also the process of the Chinese people's resistance against imperialism and its running dogs." For over a hundred years, the Chinese people have waged a heroic, tenacious, and unyielding struggle against imperialism. From the Opium War, the Taiping Rebellion, the "Small Swords Society" uprising in Shanghai, to the May 30th Movement, the three armed uprisings of Shanghai workers, and so on, countless facts prove that the Chinese people are not to be trifled with, and the Chinese working class is not to be insulted.

I myself participated in the shocking "May 30th" strike and the three armed uprisings of Shanghai workers. From my personal experience, I deeply feel what our great leader Chairman Mao taught us: "Imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers." In the May 30th Movement, imperialism massacred our workers, and we Shanghai workers united and fought back with a general strike. At that time, our factory's British boss did not allow workers to go out and participate in activities. We linked arms and rushed out of the factory's iron gate to march and demonstrate on Nanjing Road, exposing the crimes of imperialism. When we went on strike, the British boss used methods of dismissal, arrest, and beating to try to make us return to work. We workers did not listen to him at all and continued to fight. Imperialist persecution escalated, and our resistance also escalated. After 99 days of arduous struggle, our factory's strike finally achieved victory.

Chairman Mao also taught us: "Organize tens of millions of people, mobilize a vast revolutionary army, this is the need of today's revolution to attack counter-revolution." We gradually understood from the struggle that to fight against imperialism and reactionaries, we must unite and form a vast revolutionary force. As the saying goes: "One chopstick is easy to break, but a bundle of chopsticks is hard to break." In our factory's 99-day strike, imperialism used all kinds of despicable and shameful methods to try to divide and conquer us workers. We united with workers from water supply, gas, public transportation, and postal services, holding a joint strike. Thus, factories went on strike, shops closed, and schools stopped classes, almost paralyzing the entire city of Shanghai. This way, imperialism was driven into a corner, in a state of panic and disarray, and their plot was completely foiled!

Today, the struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong is in a completely new era—the era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. The days when the Chinese people were bullied and slaughtered at will are gone forever. A powerful socialist motherland is the strong backing of the Hong Kong compatriots, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for the Hong Kong compatriots. The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is inspiring the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong to rebel and struggle.

The patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong are fighting stronger and stronger. Although British imperialism appears to be fierce, in reality, it is already "the setting sun, gasping for breath." All its bloody atrocities in Hong Kong are merely the last struggles of a dying beast. The Hong Kong workers and compatriots, who have a glorious tradition of anti-imperialist and patriotic struggle, will definitely smash this paper tiger of British imperialism!

    团结一致，针锋相对，打败英国佬！
    上海杨树浦发电厂工人　姜林根
    香港工人阶级行动起来了，在二十个工会工人举行联合大罢工之后，全港海员宣布拒绝运输货物进出香港。一个新的更大规模的斗争高潮，一场反帝爱国的革命群众运动，如南海巨浪，滚滚向前，给英帝国主义在香港的反动统治以沉重打击。
    英帝国主义是中国人民不共戴天的敌人。一百多年来，这个老牌帝国主义在中国干尽了坏事，对中国人民欠下了累累血债。他们勾结中国反动派，把旧中国变成了人间地狱。他们在上海这块中国人民的领土上，辟租界，设巡捕，压榨剥削，横行霸道，无恶不作。滔滔的黄浦江水，洗不尽上海人民对帝国主义的血泪深仇。
    我们杨树浦发电厂，最先就是英帝国主义开办的。一九二四年，我来到这个工厂做工。这哪里象一家工厂呀，简直是一座吃人肉喝人血的活地狱。许多工人活着进去，死了出来。我亲眼看见一个工人在煤斗边捣煤，由于没有安全措施，一不小心跌进了煤斗，眼看大堆大堆的煤块倒下来掩埋了他的身体，我们工人弟兄急忙要求英国老板停炉抢救。狠心的英国佬，竟然不让，这个工人终于活活闷死在煤仓里。
    这一桩桩血淋淋的事实，一幅幅血迹斑斑的图画，中国人民是永远不会忘记的，我们要把这个深仇大恨牢牢记在心坎里。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“帝国主义和中国封建主义相结合，把中国变为半殖民地和殖民地的过程，也就是中国人民反抗帝国主义及其走狗的过程。”一百多年来，中国人民对帝国主义进行了英勇顽强、不屈不挠的斗争。从鸦片战争，太平天国，上海的“小刀会”起义，到五卅运动，上海工人三次武装起义，等等，无数的事实证明，中国人民是不好惹的，中国工人阶级是不可侮的。
    我自己曾经参加过震惊中外的“五卅”大罢工和上海工人三次武装起义。我从切身经历中，深深体会到我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们的：“帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。”在五卅运动中，帝国主义屠杀了我们工人，我们上海工人阶级就联合起来，用大罢工同它进行针锋相对的斗争。当时我们厂的英国老板不许工人出去活动，我们就手挽手冲出了工厂的铁门，到南京路上去游行示威，揭发帝国主义的罪恶。当我们罢工的时候，英国老板又用开除、逮捕、殴打等等高压手段，企图使我们复工。我们工人根本不听他这一套，继续坚持斗争。帝国主义的迫害升级，我们的反抗也升级。经过九十九天的艰苦斗争，我们厂的罢工斗争终于取得了胜利。
    毛主席还教导我们：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”我们从斗争中逐步懂得，同帝国主义和反动派作斗争，必须联合起来，组成浩浩荡荡的革命队伍。俗话说：“一根筷子容易断，一把筷子断不了”，团结起来才有力量。在我们厂的九十九天罢工斗争中，帝国主义使用了一切卑鄙无耻手段，企图把我们工人分化瓦解，各个击破。我们就联合了自来水、煤气、公交、邮电等六大公用事业的工人举行联合大罢工。于是，工厂罢工，商店罢市，学校罢课，几乎使上海全市瘫痪。这样一来，帝国主义被搞得焦头烂额，狼狈不堪，他们的阴谋彻底破产了！
    今天，香港爱国同胞的斗争，处在一个完全崭新的时代——以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。中国人民受人欺负、任人宰割的日子已经一去不复返了。强大的社会主义祖国是香港同胞的坚强后盾，战无不胜的毛泽东思想是香港同胞的指路明灯。史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命正在鼓舞着香港爱国同胞起来造反，起来斗争。
    香港爱国同胞越战越强，英帝国主义尽管表面上张牙舞爪，实际上已经是“日薄西山，气息奄奄”。它在香港的一切血腥暴行，只不过是它垂死挣扎的表现。具有反帝爱国光荣斗争传统的香港工人和香港同胞，一定能够砸烂英帝国主义这只纸老虎！
