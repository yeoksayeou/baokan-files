The people of Wuhan, both military and civilian, are singing and dancing in celebration of the great news: "Chairman Mao has written to us!"

We fully support and resolutely implement Chairman Mao's latest instructions. The letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group has brought a new and immense driving force to the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan. The revolutionary masses and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army have expressed their determination to strengthen unity, to enlighten and educate the deceived masses, and to return them to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, to jointly fight against the enemy.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, July 30th: The letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary masses and the broad soldiers and officers of Wuhan has brought a new and immense driving force to the flourishing Cultural Revolution in Wuhan. Today, the banks of the surging Yangtze River are filled with processions and rallies. People have flooded the streets, singing and dancing, enthusiastically celebrating this great news. "Chairman Mao has written to us!" "We will not disappoint Chairman Mao and Vice Chairman Lin's expectations for us!" "Long live Chairman Mao for ten thousand years!" The cheers echo through the three districts of Wuhan.

The revolutionary masses and the broad soldiers and officers of Wuhan are filled with revolutionary passion and say: This letter is excellent! It is the deepest concern, most resolute support, greatest encouragement, strongest urging, and most brilliant guidance from Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group for the revolutionary masses and the broad soldiers and officers of Wuhan. This letter is an important document guiding the current Cultural Revolution in Wuhan. We fully support it, respond to it, and implement it.

At 3 AM, the broad soldiers and officers of the Wuhan garrison, who have been fighting side by side with the revolutionary masses, eagerly spread this good news to the people of the entire city. They read this letter of joy repeatedly in the broadcasting station and on the propaganda vehicle with full enthusiasm. Many soldiers and officers also walked to the streets, posting this letter all over the streets and alleys of the three districts of Wuhan. The leadership of the Wuhan Air Force also dispatched planes to distribute this letter over the three districts of Wuhan. The broad revolutionary masses of Wuhan are even more spirited and full of fighting spirit. They hurriedly copied this letter on large red paper and posted slogans celebrating this great news all over the streets of the three districts.

Slogans such as "Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud" are posted all over the streets of the three districts.

The revolutionary masses and the revolutionary youngsters of the factories, along with the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, are filled with excitement and joy, surging towards the square to hold rallies, enthusiastically celebrating the letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the revolutionary masses and the broad soldiers and officers of Wuhan. The responsible person of "Steel General" said excitedly at the meeting: Chairman Mao, we will always listen to your words, maintain high vigilance, and always advance along your proletarian revolutionary line. We must unite all the masses who can be united, educate and help those who have been deceived, and quickly return them to your proletarian revolutionary line, launching a counterattack. We must take further action, seriously study this letter you gave us, and resolutely fight to defend you, defend Vice Chairman Lin, defend the Party Central Committee, and defend the Central Cultural Revolution Group. We will fight for the thorough victory of the Cultural Revolution.

The news reached the Wuhan Steel Company, and the already boiling "Wuhan Steel" became even more boiling. The revolutionary fighters of "Steel 9Â·13" held the letter from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, congratulating each other and saying excitedly: This is the greatest support, concern, and encouragement from Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group for us! We must study this letter well and resolutely act according to the spirit of this letter. Now the situation in Wuhan is excellent, and we revolutionary masses must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and advance victoriously. We vow to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

The news reached the universities and colleges in the Wuhan area, and the revolutionary youngsters who have been fighting in the Cultural Revolution could not help but cheer and jump for joy. "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao for ten thousand years!" The slogans echoed through the sky. The fighters of "Steel Second Bureau" and "Third Bureau Revolutionary Alliance" from Wuhan Surveying and Mapping Academy, Wuhan University, Central China Normal University, and Wuhan Institute of Technology held nighttime parades. They sang loudly, "The party's kindness is greater than the sky and the earth, parents are not as dear as Chairman Mao." They said excitedly: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! In the days of white terror under the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, it was your great thoughts that illuminated our eyes, making us recognize the reactionary faces of the handful of power-holders within the party and the army who are taking the capitalist road, and the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who insist on the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. You pointed out the direction for us to advance and gave us the confidence and strength to persist in the struggle and achieve victory! It was you who sent Comrades Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li to Wuhan to handle the problems of the Cultural Revolution, defeating the mad counterattack of the class enemy. Now, you have issued new battle orders to us, and we will implement them word for word and sentence by sentence. The fighters of "New Hua Farm" heard the good news at dawn, immediately became excited, sang "The Ship of the Sea Needs a Helmsman" and songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, held celebration rallies, fully expressing the revolutionary fighters' boundless love, admiration, faith, and loyalty to the great leader Chairman Mao, and their resolute determination to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end. The fighters of "New Hua Workers" and "New Lake University" also firmly declared: While celebrating our victory, we must maintain high vigilance, strengthen internal unity, enlighten and educate everyone who has been deceived and stood on the wrong side, help them quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and further carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating the "falling dogs." We will fight and expose the handful of power-holders within the party and the army who are taking the capitalist road, fight them to the end, criticize them deeply and thoroughly, and achieve the thorough victory of the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan.

The broad revolutionary masses of the provincial organs of Hubei Province spread the good news late last night. They said, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's letter speaks to our hearts, pointing out the direction for us to advance. This letter is our action guide for the revolutionary masses of Wuhan to achieve victory in the Cultural Revolution. Today, before dawn, they went to the streets for propaganda. Many revolutionary cadres also held study sessions, studying this letter word by word. They declared: We will unite with the revolutionary masses of Wuhan and fight side by side with the broad soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army, exposing the handful of power-holders within the party and the army who are taking the capitalist road, fighting them to the end, and exposing them thoroughly.

The good news of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's letter reached the People's Liberation Army stationed in Wuhan. The barracks, airfields, and ship decks were all in a state of excitement, reading and studying Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's letter. Many soldiers and officers held nighttime rallies and parades, expressing their determination. Letters of determination, congratulatory messages, and large-character posters were posted all over the camp. They unanimously declared: We will resolutely respond to Chairman Mao's call, continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely support and defend the broad leftist masses, fight with them, and achieve victory with them. The air force of a certain unit held a celebration rally at 1 AM today and immediately organized a congratulatory team to go to the nearby "Steel General" subdivisions to congratulate them. The military and the people jointly expressed: We must spread Chairman Mao's voice to every corner; we must engrave Chairman Mao's latest instructions in our minds, dissolve them in our blood, and implement them in our actions, forever advancing along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The commander of a certain unit, Lan Qingxiang, said: "Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee understand us the most, support us the most, and trust us the most. Chairman Mao supports us, and we must make Chairman Mao proud, not disappointing the great commander Chairman Mao's expectations for us. No matter how many difficulties we encounter on the road ahead, to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we dare to climb the knife mountain and cross the fire sea." The soldiers and officers of the unit where Huang Jiguang served before said, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's letter has given correct and brilliant instructions for the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan, which is the fundamental guarantee for the continued victory of the Cultural Revolution in Wuhan. We resolutely stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be heart to heart with the revolutionary masses, forever unite and fight, and forever advance to victory.
