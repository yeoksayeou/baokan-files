Japanese friends on the eve of the 30th anniversary of the Lugou Bridge Incident emphasize studying and applying Chairman Mao's works

Japanese revolutionaries, youth actively engaged in Sino-Japanese friendship, and renowned historian Inoue Kiyoshi have all issued statements emphasizing the need for the Japanese people to strengthen their combat unity with the Chinese people. They advocate using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to oppose the common enemies of the Japanese and Chinese peoples—U.S. imperialism, Japanese militarism, and modern revisionism.

A young worker from Saitama Prefecture, Nori Kikuo, said, "If we can study and apply Chairman Mao's works and arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, then we can unite the broad masses of the people, isolate and ultimately defeat and destroy the forces of U.S. imperialism and Japanese militarism. The victory of the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japan led by Chairman Mao and the victory of the Chinese revolution prove this point."

Nori said, "As Chairman Mao teaches, the broad masses of the Japanese people are the true friends of the Chinese people. Now, U.S. imperialists, reactionaries of various countries, Soviet modern revisionists, and Japanese Communist Party revisionists are frantically attacking China, but this is merely 'lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet.' The victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao personally has greatly inspired the revolutionary people of the whole world. We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, join hands with the Chinese people, and repel any attacks by the enemy, resolutely defending the world revolution's base area—China."

Female student Miura Masako said, "Japanese revolutionary youth are determined to take up arms and fight side by side with the Chinese people for the liberation of all the peoples of the world."

Miura strongly condemned the treacherous actions of the Japanese Communist Party revisionists. She said, "Now, the Japanese Communist Party revisionists are engaged in anti-China, exclusionist, and bourgeois pacifist propaganda. They do not distinguish between just and unjust wars but oppose all wars indiscriminately. We must smash this bourgeois pacifist propaganda and strive to propagate Chairman Mao's correct views on war and peace: 'We are advocates of the annihilation of war, we do not want war; but war can only be eliminated through war, and those who do not want to take up arms must take up arms.'"

An employee of a trading company, Kida Hiroshi, said, "On the 30th anniversary of the Lugou Bridge Incident, we once again express our determination to carry the struggle against imperialism and revisionism to the end." He said, "The current situation is as Chairman Mao teaches, the East Wind prevails over the West Wind. The struggle of the oppressed peoples of the world is surging like a storm, dealing heavy blows to U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism. The Japanese people play an important role in this struggle. Today, we must unite with the Chinese people to smash the U.S. imperialists' ambition to invade China. Although U.S. imperialism appears strong, in reality, as Chairman Mao correctly points out, imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers. Soviet modern revisionism, however, colludes with U.S. imperialism, betraying the peoples of the Arab countries. The oppressed peoples of the world have seen through the treacherous actions of the Soviet revisionists and will certainly rise up to smash their betrayal."

Kida said, "The Chinese people are the most reliable comrades of the Japanese people. Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest and most correct thought produced and developed in the struggle, and it points the way for the struggle of the Japanese people. As long as we study and apply Mao Zedong Thought in the struggle, then even if there are twists and turns in the process of the struggle, ultimate victory will surely be ours."

The chairman of the Kanagawa Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), Mochizuki Noboru, said, "The broad masses of the Japanese people have been learning the great universal truth—Mao Zedong Thought, arming themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, and using Mao Zedong Thought as the most powerful and invincible weapon to fight for their liberation." He said, "The Japanese people have experienced these years of painful lessons and have already realized who their true enemies are and who their true friends are. If U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries again threaten the Japanese people with bayonets and attack the Chinese people as they did 30 years ago, the Japanese people will certainly rise up to fight a just struggle and will unhesitatingly repay them in kind, surrounding and annihilating a handful of enemies."

A member of the Kyoto Prefecture branch of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), Inoue Shoichiro, said, "The path that the Japanese people should take is to unite closely with the Chinese people and fight against the common enemy."

Inoue said, "Today, U.S. imperialism and the Japanese reactionaries are again preparing to invade China. If they again wage an unjust war against China, then a just war will certainly triumph in the struggle against an unjust war."

Renowned Japanese historian Inoue Kiyoshi said, "We must propagate to the broad masses of the people that U.S. imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital will again drive the masses to be cannon fodder in the war of aggression against China, and establish a broad united front to oppose the war of aggression, oppose imperialism, and insist on the combat unity of the peoples of Japan and China."

Inoue said, "On the 30th anniversary of the Lugou Bridge Incident, the Japanese people should closely unite with the Chinese people and fight against U.S. imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, and modern revisionists who serve them."

　　日本朋友在“七七”事变三十周年前夕强调活学活用毛主席著作
　　日中两国人民加强团结反对共同敌人
    据新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道：在“七七”事变三十周年前夕，日本革命青年、从事日中友好运动的积极分子和著名历史学家井上清纷纷发表谈话指出，日本人民要加强同中国人民的战斗团结，用毛泽东思想作为武器，来反对日中两国人民的共同敌人——美帝国主义、日本军国主义和现代修正主义。
    埼玉县青年工人练木久雄说：“如果我们能够活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己，那末，我们就能够团结广大的人民群众，使美帝国主义和日本军国主义势力陷于孤立，最后压倒和消灭它们。毛泽东主席领导的中国人民抗日战争的胜利和中国革命的胜利就证明了这一点。”
    练木说：正如毛主席教导的，日本广大的人民都是中国人民真正的朋友。现在美帝国主义者、各国反动派、苏联现代修正主义者和日共修正主义分子拚命攻击中国，这只不过是“搬起石头打自己的脚”。毛主席亲自领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利给全世界革命人民极大的鼓舞。我们决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同中国人民携起手来，反击敌人的任何攻击，坚决保卫世界革命的根据地——中国。
    女学生三浦正子说：日本革命青年决心拿起枪杆子，为全世界人民的解放事业，同中国人民并肩战斗。
    三浦强烈谴责日共修正主义分子的叛卖行为。她说：现在日共修正主义分子进行反华、排外主义和资产阶级和平主义的宣传。他们不区分正义的战争和非正义的战争，而一概反对战争。我们必须粉碎这些资产阶级和平主义的宣传，而努力宣传毛主席关于战争与和平的正确论断：“我们是战争消灭论者，我们是不要战争的；但是只能经过战争去消灭战争，不要枪杆子必须拿起枪杆子。”
    贸易公司的职员木田洋说，在“七七”事变三十周年的时候，我们再次表示决心把反帝反修斗争进行到底。他说：目前的形势正如毛主席所教导的那样，是东风压倒西风。世界被压迫人民的斗争象怒涛一样汹涌澎湃，给予美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义以猛烈的打击。日本人民在这场斗争中占有重要的地位。今天，我们必须同中国人民团结起来，粉碎美帝国主义侵略中国的野心。美帝国主义貌似强大，但是实际上正如毛主席正确指出的，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎。苏联现代修正主义却同美帝国主义勾结起来，背叛了阿拉伯各国人民。世界被压迫人民看清了苏修的背叛行为，他们必将起来粉碎苏修的叛卖活动。
    木田说：“中国人民是日本人民最可靠的战友。毛泽东思想是在斗争中产生和发展起来的最伟大、最正确的思想，它指明了日本人民斗争的方向。只要我们在斗争中活学活用毛泽东思想，那末尽管我们在斗争的过程中会有曲折，但是最后的胜利必定是属于我们的。”
    日中友好协会（正统）神奈川县总部理事长望月登说：“日本广大人民群众一直在学习伟大的普遍真理——毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装自己，把毛泽东思想作为争取他们解放的最强大的战无不胜的武器。”他说：“日本人民经受了这些年的痛苦经验，已经认识清楚，谁是他们真正的敌人，谁是他们真正的朋友。如果美帝国主义和日本反动派还象三十年前那样用刺刀威吓日本人民再次进攻中国人民的话，日本人民定将奋起进行正义斗争，并毫不含糊地以其人之道还治其人之身，包围和消灭一小撮敌人。”
    日中友好协会（正统）京都府总部会员井上庄一郎说，同中国人民牢牢地团结起来，和共同敌人作斗争，这是日本人民应该走的道路。
    井上说：“今天，美帝国主义和日本反动派又在准备侵略中国。如果他们再次对中国进行非正义战争，那末，正义战争在同非正义战争的斗争中必定胜利。”
    日本著名历史学家井上清说，我们必须向广大的人民宣传美帝国主义和日本垄断资本将再次驱使人民大众充当侵华战争的炮灰，并且建立反对侵略战争、反对帝国主义、坚持日中两国人民战斗团结的广泛的统一战线。
    井上说，“在‘七七’事变三十周年的时候，日本人民应当和中国人民紧密地团结起来，同美帝国主义、日本反动派以及为它们效劳的现代修正主义进行斗争。”
