The Hong Kong British authorities dared to brazenly kidnap our country's news agency staff. Xinhua News Agency warns the Hong Kong British authorities must immediately release our reporter. The Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency lodges the most urgent and strongest protest against the British Empire's serious political provocation.

Xinhua News Agency, July 12th: Xinhua News Agency today sent a telegram to the Hong Kong British authorities, lodging the most urgent and strongest protest against the Hong Kong British fascist authorities' unreasonable arrest of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch reporter Xue Ping, warning that the Hong Kong British authorities must immediately release Xue Ping, otherwise they must bear all serious consequences.

The telegram said: In the early hours of the 11th, the Hong Kong British authorities dispatched armed police to repeatedly carry out bloody suppression of patriotic compatriots in the Wan Chai area. The Hong Kong British fascist authorities, fearing that their crimes would be exposed, brazenly and unreasonably kidnapped Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch reporter Xue Ping, who was conducting normal reporting at the scene. The Hong Kong British authorities' fascist atrocities not only seriously violated the freedom of Chinese journalists to report, but also constituted a blatant political provocation against the Chinese people. The Hong Kong British authorities' fascist atrocities have aroused the extreme indignation of all staff of Xinhua News Agency. Therefore, Xinhua News Agency lodges the most urgent and strongest protest against the Hong Kong British fascist authorities. At the same time, Xinhua News Agency firmly supports the Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency's director Liang Weilin's solemn demand to the Hong Kong British fascist authorities.

It should be pointed out that the Hong Kong British authorities, fearing that Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch reporters would expose their fascist atrocities, have repeatedly obstructed Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch reporters who were conducting normal reporting activities, conducting forced searches and savage beatings, using every means possible. After beating Xinhua News Agency reporter Su Qiang on May 11, they unreasonably obstructed and conducted humiliating searches on Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch deputy editor Wang Lei and reporters Chen Guorong and Chen Mingzhu on June 25. The Hong Kong British authorities' hatred for Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch shows that they have no intention of repenting. However, you think you can use violence to stop the spread of the great Mao Zedong Thought, this will never succeed. All your plots are doomed to complete failure.

Xinhua News Agency solemnly demands that the Hong Kong British authorities:

Immediately release our reporter Xue Ping, apologize to the victim, and compensate for all losses;
Guarantee the normal reporting activities and personal safety of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch staff. Ensure that similar incidents do not occur again.
If the Hong Kong British authorities insist on their own way, then all serious consequences must be borne by the Hong Kong British authorities.

Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong, July 11th: The Hong Kong fascist authorities brazenly and unreasonably kidnapped Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch reporter Xue Ping, who was conducting normal reporting activities, in the early hours of today.

Last night until today in the early hours, the Hong Kong British "riot police" repeatedly carried out bloody atrocities in the Wan Chai area, suppressing our patriotic compatriots. Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch reporter Xue Ping was conducting normal reporting activities at the scene, but at 1:40 a.m. today, the Hong Kong armed police brazenly kidnapped him at the scene. At the time, Xue Ping immediately identified himself as a Xinhua News Agency reporter and showed his press card. The "riot police" ignored this and brutally seized Xue Ping's camera, forcibly taking him onto a police car and subsequently detaining him at the "Eastern District Police Station."

Today at 3:30 a.m. to 4:30 a.m., Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch deputy editor Pan Desheng twice telephoned the Hong Kong British "Police Political Department" and went to the "Eastern District Police Station" to lodge the strongest protest against this matter, demanding that they release the person immediately. The other side repeatedly used the excuse of "under investigation" to flatly refuse. This morning at 9:15 a.m., Pan Desheng and another deputy editor of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch, Tan Gan, went to the "Police Political Department" to protest and demand the immediate release of the person. But the person in charge, Li Ze Xin, used the excuse that "Xue Ping was not arrested by the 'Political Department' but by the armed police, and if a crime was committed, it would be dealt with according to law." Pan Desheng immediately asked him: Our reporter is conducting normal reporting activities, what crime has he committed? Li Ze Xin, feeling guilty and embarrassed, stammered and had no words to reply.

At 6:00 a.m. today, Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch director Liang Weilin telephoned the Hong Kong British "Acting Governor" David Trench, lodging the most urgent and strongest protest against this matter. The telegram pointed out: "The Hong Kong British authorities' violation of the normal reporting activities of reporters, unreasonable detention of our country's news agency reporter, is very serious." "You must immediately release our reporter Xue Ping and publicly apologize. Guarantee the reporting freedom of our reporters in the future. Otherwise, all serious consequences should be borne by the Hong Kong British authorities."

At 6:15 p.m. today, five representatives of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch staff went to the Hong Kong British "Governor's House" to lodge the strongest and most urgent protest to David Trench. David Trench hid inside, and only an interpreter came out. During the representatives' protest, the Hong Kong British authorities dispatched six "riot control vehicles," fully loaded with armed police, stopping in front of the "Governor's House," with armed police threatening the representatives with weapons. The representatives ignored the police's provocation and continued to read the protest letter, shouting slogans: "Oppose the Hong Kong British fascist atrocities!" "The Hong Kong British authorities must immediately release our reporter!" "The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is invincible!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years, ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

The Hong Kong British fascist authorities have been deliberately creating a series of bloody atrocities to suppress Hong Kong compatriots since May 6. Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch has exposed this powerfully, and the Hong Kong British authorities are very afraid and extremely hostile, repeatedly persecuting Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch editors and reporters who are engaged in normal business activities, including savagely beating reporters, forcibly searching reporting vehicles, threatening reporters with force, and publicly intercepting and forcibly searching the vehicle of deputy editor Wang Lei and reporters Chen Guorong and Chen Mingzhu on June 25. The Hong Kong British authorities think they can use these fascist methods to prevent Xinhua News Agency from exposing them and provoking them, this is completely a foolish fantasy.

    港英当局竟敢悍然绑架我国家通讯社人员
    新华社警告港英当局必须立即释放我记者
    香港分社最紧急最强烈抗议英帝的严重政治挑衅
    新华社十二日讯　新华通讯社今天打电报给香港英国当局最紧急、最强烈地抗议港英法西斯当局无理逮捕新华社香港分社记者薛平的法西斯暴行，警告港英当局必须立即释放薛平，否则它必须承担一切严重后果。
    电报说，十一日凌晨，港英当局派出武装警察不断在湾仔地区对爱国同胞进行血腥镇压，港英法西斯当局由于害怕他们的罪行公诸于世，竟横蛮无理地对在现场进行正常采访的新华社香港分社记者薛平进行绑架。港英当局这种法西斯暴行，不仅严重地破坏了中国新闻记者的采访自由，而且也是对中国人民的一次明目张胆的政治挑衅。港英当局这种法西斯暴行，激起了新华通讯社全体人员的无比愤慨，为此，新华通讯社向港英法西斯当局提出最紧急、最强烈的抗议。同时，新华通讯社坚决支持新华社香港分社社长梁威林就此对港英法西斯当局提出的严正要求。
    应该指出，港英当局由于害怕新华社香港分社记者对他们的法西斯暴行进行揭露，因此，一再对从事正常采访活动的新华社香港分社记者进行横蛮阻挠，强行搜查和野蛮殴打，无所不用其极。它在五月十一日殴打新华社记者司徒强之后，又在六月二十五日对新华社香港分社副总编辑王磊和记者陈国荣、陈明珠进行无理阻拦和侮辱性的搜查。港英当局如此仇恨新华社香港分社，说明它毫无悔罪之意。但是，你们妄想使用暴力来阻遏伟大的毛泽东思想的传播，这是决不会得逞的。你们的一切阴谋是注定要彻底破产的。
    新华通讯社严正要求港英当局：
    立即释放本社记者薛平，向受害者道歉，并赔偿一切损失；
    保证新华社香港分社工作人员的正常采访活动和人身安全。保证不再发生类似事件。
    港英当局如果一意孤行，那么，一切严重后果，必须由港英当局承担。
    新华社香港十一日电  香港法西斯当局，今天凌晨横蛮无理地绑架正在进行正常采访活动的新华社香港分社记者薛平。
    昨天晚上至今天凌晨，港英“防暴队”不断在湾仔地区制造血腥暴行，镇压我爱国同胞，新华社香港分社记者薛平在现场进行正常的采访活动，但在今天凌晨一时四十分，港英武装警察竟在现场对他施行无理绑架。当时薛平立即表明新华社记者身份，并出示记者证，“防暴队”却不加理睬，并蛮横地抢走薛平的相机，将他强力挟持上警车，随后把他扣押在“东区警署”。
    今天清晨三时半至四时半，新华社香港分社副总编辑潘德声两次同港英“警务处政治部”通电话，并前往“东区警署”，就此事提出最强烈的抗议，要它们马上放人。对方竟一再以“在调查中”为借口，横加拒绝。今天早上九时十五分，潘德声和新华社香港分社另一位副总编辑谭干前往“警务处政治部”抗议并要求立即放人。但该部负责人李择信竟借口“薛平不是由‘政治部’逮捕，而是由武装警察逮捕，如果犯了罪将按法律处理”。潘德声当即质问他：我社记者进行正常的采访活动，犯了什么罪？李择信理亏心虚，支支唔唔，无言答对。
    今天早上六时整，新华社香港分社社长梁威林致电港英“代理总督”祁济时，就此事向他提出最紧急、最强烈的抗议。电文指出：“港英当局这种侵犯记者正常采访活动，无理扣押我国家通讯社记者，这是十分严重的”。“你必须立即释放我社记者薛平，并公开道歉。保证今后我社记者的采访自由。否则，一切严重后果应由港英当局负责”。
    今天下午六时十五分，新华社香港分社工作人员代表五人前往港英“总督府”，向祁济时提出最强烈、最紧急的抗议。祁济时龟缩在内，只有一名翻译出见。在代表们提抗议过程中，港英当局竟出动六部“防暴车”，满载荷枪实弹的警察，停在“总督府”门前，武装警察贴近代表，进行猖狂的武力威胁。代表们对警察的挑衅毫不理会，继续把抗议书宣读完，并高呼口号：“反对港英法西斯暴行！”“港英当局必须立即释放我社记者！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    港英法西斯当局从五月六日开始，蓄意制造了一连串血腥镇压香港同胞的暴行，新华社香港分社进行了有力的揭露，港英当局对此十分害怕，极端仇视，一再对从事正常业务活动的新华社香港分社编辑、记者进行迫害，包括野蛮殴打记者，强行搜查采访汽车，武力威胁记者，并在六月二十五日公然围截并强行搜查副总编辑王磊乘坐的汽车，以及记者陈国荣、陈明珠等的采访汽车。港英当局以为用这种法西斯手段就可以使新华社不揭露它，不刺激它，这完全是痴心妄想。
