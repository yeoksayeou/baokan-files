South Vietnamese Liberation Army launches a powerful offensive south of the demilitarized zone

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 5th, the armed forces of South Vietnam's Quang Tri Province have launched a new powerful offensive against U.S. invader positions south of the demilitarized zone since July 2nd. This attack follows the armed forces' elimination of over 300 U.S. troops in the Xa Xinh area on June 26th and 27th. Preliminary reports indicate that nearly a thousand U.S. invaders have been annihilated.

	The armed forces' battle near Kon Tum was particularly impressive. According to reports from Western news agencies, from the 2nd to the 4th, the armed forces had annihilated nearly 400 U.S. Marines here. On the morning of the 2nd, as the U.S. invaders moved out from Kon Tum, they were immediately intercepted and annihilated by the armed forces, resulting in the complete destruction of one company and severe damage to another. On the 3rd, the U.S. forces continued to suffer heavy losses.

	On the 2nd, the armed forces also achieved a significant victory in the Yu Linh Commune of Yu An District, not far from Kon Tum, where they repelled a U.S. Marine "sweeping" operation. According to the South Vietnamese Liberation News Agency, that afternoon, several companies of U.S. Marines, supported by tanks, aircraft, and artillery, advanced in four directions towards Yu An. The armed forces' artillery and infantry coordinated closely, delivering a devastating blow to the enemy. The brave and skilled fighters of the armed forces, under the cover of artillery, charged forward, splitting the enemy into smaller groups, and engaged in close combat with submachine guns and grenades, annihilating two companies of U.S. troops and severely damaging another two. Additionally, the armed forces destroyed three enemy tanks, shot down one aircraft, and damaged several more.

	Facing the new powerful offensive by the armed forces, the Associated Press reported on the 5th that U.S. troops suffered heavy casualties, stating that due to political, geographical, and guerrilla warfare factors, the situation is highly unfavorable for the U.S. troops, and these unfavorable conditions will worsen as the war progresses.

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 5th, the South Vietnamese Liberation News Agency reported that on the night of June 23rd, the armed forces of Quang Ngai Province in South Vietnam launched a fierce attack with heavy weapons on the U.S. invaders' Ngoc Hoi airfield, annihilating 300 U.S. invaders, destroying 30 enemy aircraft, six cannons, one tank, and demolishing and burning 30 enemy barracks and one warehouse.

	Ngoc Hoi airfield is a U.S. invader forward base, frequently housing about 100 helicopters and transport planes, defended by a U.S. infantry battalion and an artillery battalion. This attack by the armed forces dealt a severe blow to the U.S. invaders, causing them to panic.

　　炮兵步兵密切配合　勇猛冲杀大打近战　速战速决连连歼敌
　　南越解放军在非军事区以南发动强大攻势
    据新华社河内五日电  越南南方广治省解放武装力量从七月二日以来，又对非军事区以南的美国侵略军阵地发起新的强大攻势。这次进攻是解放武装力量紧接着在六月二十六日和二十七日消灭溪星地区的三百多名美军以后发动的。初步消息表明，美国侵略军已被歼灭近千名。
    解放武装力量在昆天附近的战斗打得非常漂亮。据西方通讯社消息透露，从二日到四日，解放武装力量已经在这里歼灭美国海军陆战队近四百人。在二日上午，美国侵略军刚刚从昆天出动，就遭到解放武装力量的猛烈截击，被全歼一个连，重创另一个连。三日，美军继续遭到大量杀伤。
    解放武装力量二日在距离昆天不远的犹灵县犹安乡也打了大胜仗，把前去“扫荡”的美国海军陆战队打得落花流水。据越南南方解放通讯社报道，这天中午，美国海军陆战队几个连，在坦克、飞机和大炮掩护下，分成四路向犹安乡进犯。解放武装力量的炮兵和步兵密切配合作战，给敌人以迎头痛击。英勇善战的解放武装力量的战士们，在炮兵的掩护下，勇猛冲锋，把敌人分割成许多小块，用冲锋枪和手榴弹打近战，消灭了美军两个连，重创另两个连。另外，解放武装力量还击毁击伤敌人坦克三辆，击落飞机一架，击伤多架。
    面对解放武装力量的新的强大攻势，美联社在五日的消息中惊呼美军死伤惨重，“由于政治、地形和游击战争的缘故”，对美军十分不利，“而这些不利的情况还要随着战争的发展日益恶化。”
    据新华社河内五日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方广义省解放武装力量，六月二十三日夜间用重型武器猛烈袭击美国侵略军的鹅会机场，消灭美国侵略军三百名，击毁敌机三十架、大炮六门、坦克一辆，摧毁和烧毁敌人营房三十座和仓库一座。
    鹅会机场是美国侵略军的一个野战基地，经常停放直升飞机和运输机约一百架，由美军一个步兵营和一个炮兵营防守。解放武装力量这次袭击给美国侵略强盗以非常沉重的打击，使敌人惊恐万状。
