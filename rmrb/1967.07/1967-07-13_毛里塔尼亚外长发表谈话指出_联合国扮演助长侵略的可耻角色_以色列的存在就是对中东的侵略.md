    Mauritania's Foreign Minister Says UN Plays Shameful Role in Fomenting Aggression, Israel's Existence Is Aggression Against the Middle East

    Nouakchott, July 11 (Xinhua) - Mauritania's Foreign Minister Bilani Mamadou Wane delivered a speech on July 8 to Mauritania Radio, condemning the United Nations for playing a shameful role under the manipulation of the United States and Britain in the recent Israeli aggression against Arab countries. He pointed out that the United States and Britain have always been Israel's protectors, and the United States is the backer of Zionist aggression in the Middle East.

    Mauritania's Foreign Minister made this statement after participating in the emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the Middle East issue. Wane pointed out that it is extremely serious that the United Nations "does not condemn aggression, and even does not acknowledge that there is aggression. This is an encouragement of aggression." He said, "We condemn imperialist aggression because this aggression occurs in Africa, Asia, Latin America, and all over the world."

    The Foreign Minister said, "Recent events in the United Nations have shown that if a sudden attack and military occupation of a country is carried out, it can be recognized by the United Nations General Assembly due to the fait accompli and stay there. He said: "We no longer believe that appeals to the United Nations will have any effect. We believe that the United Nations is unable to solve any problem."

    Wane emphasized, "To demand that Arab countries negotiate with Israel is an insult to the Arab countries. This issue has been dragged on for twenty years, and the existence of Israel itself is aggression against the Middle East. Now to propose the issue of negotiations, this is an insult to the Arab countries."

    毛里塔尼亚外长发表谈话指出
    联合国扮演助长侵略的可耻角色
    以色列的存在就是对中东的侵略
    新华社努瓦克肖特十一日电　毛里塔尼亚外交部长比拉尼·马马杜·瓦尼八日向毛里塔尼亚电台发表讲话，谴责联合国在美英操纵下，在最近以色列侵略阿拉伯国家的事件中扮演了可耻角色。他指出，美国和英国一贯是以色列的庇护者，美国还是犹太复国主义者侵略中东的后台老板。
    毛里塔尼亚外长是在参加了讨论中东问题的联合国大会紧急会议后发表这一讲话的。瓦尼指出，十分严重的是，联合国“不谴责侵略，甚至不承认那儿有侵略。这是对侵略的一种鼓励”。他说，我们谴责帝国主义的侵略，因为这种侵略在非洲、亚洲和拉丁美洲以及在全世界到处发生。
    这位外交部长说，联合国的最近事态证明，只要对某一个国家进行突然袭击和进行军事占领，就可以由于既成事实得到联合国大会的承认而赖在那里。他说：“我们再也不相信向联合国发出呼吁会有什么效果了。我们认为，联合国没有能力解决任何问题。”
    瓦尼强调说：“要求阿拉伯国家同以色列谈判，是对阿拉伯国家的侮辱。这个问题已经拖了二十年了，以色列存在的本身就是对中东的侵略。现在企图提出谈判问题，这是对阿拉伯国家的侮辱。”
