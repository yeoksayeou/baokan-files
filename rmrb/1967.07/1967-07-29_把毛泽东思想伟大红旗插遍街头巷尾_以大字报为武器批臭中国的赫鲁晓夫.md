Shanghai's proletarian revolutionaries have set up street big-character poster columns to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, attracting millions of revolutionary masses to join in the great criticism. This has plunged the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road into a vast sea of struggle by the people, who are denouncing them with both words and writing.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Shanghai on the 27th, Chairman Mao teaches us: "Big-character posters are a very useful new weapon." In the current great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses of Shanghai have been posting big-character posters on the streets, focusing on revolutionary criticism. With dense and fierce firepower, they are launching a general offensive against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Together with the revolutionary criticism within various departments and units, it has formed a powerful revolutionary torrent, plunging China's Khrushchev and his clique into the vast sea of struggle by the revolutionary masses, who are denouncing them with both words and writing.

The big-character poster columns for revolutionary criticism that cover the streets of Shanghai are a stronghold for propagating Mao Zedong Thought, an important battlefield for annihilating the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, a great achievement of the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses of Shanghai in adhering to the direction of struggle, and a sign of the revolutionary criticism driving the struggle, criticism, and reform in this region and unit to develop further. From the fighting Red May to now, the number of street big-character poster columns for revolutionary criticism has been increasing. From the fields of literature, education, publishing, and a few others, it has developed to the fields of industry, commerce, news, sports, health, trade unions, youth work, united front work, overseas Chinese work, and gardening and greening, and generally, each has its own fixed position. The people writing big-character posters are becoming more diverse, including workers, poor and lower-middle peasants, PLA soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary intellectuals, shop assistants, and even Little Red Guards and neighborhood committee members. The areas are also expanding, originally mainly posted on Nanjing Road and other main streets, now extended to every street and alley in the city. The big-character poster columns have attracted millions of revolutionary masses to join in the struggle of revolutionary criticism. Those big-character posters and propaganda materials for "internal warfare" are not only fewer in number but are also squeezed to the side, with fewer and fewer viewers.

Eagerly propagating Mao Zedong Thought, propagating the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and propagating the Party's policies and directives is a common feature of Shanghai's street big-character posters. Many proletarian revolutionary fighters have realized that the streets and alleys are also important battlefields. If proletarian ideology does not occupy these positions, bourgeois ideology will. Setting up more and better big-character poster columns is to hoist the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought everywhere in the streets and alleys. Whether the big-character poster columns highlight proletarian politics and whether the revolutionary criticism can hit the target is a test of whether the proletarian revolutionaries have seriously studied and deeply understood Mao Zedong Thought. Generally, the street big-character poster columns place a carefully drawn portrait of Chairman Mao in the most prominent position, select relevant quotations from Chairman Mao as the guiding ideology for each issue. Many big-character poster columns also carefully edit special quotations from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's policies and directives, helping the broad masses to systematically understand Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts and the spirit of the Party Central Committee's policies, and better grasp and use revolutionary criticism as a powerful weapon. In recent times, all fronts in Shanghai have launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, classes have resumed with revolution, revolution is grasped, production is promoted, revolutionary great alliances and revolutionary "three-in-one combinations" are developing victoriously. The street big-character poster columns not only timely reflect this great situation but also play a role in exchanging information and experiences, truly becoming "a powerful weapon to unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy, helping the people to unite as one and fight against the enemy."

Wielding the thousand-jin cudgel of Mao Zedong Thought, concentrating firepower on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, exposing their counter-revolutionary plots, attacking their vital points, and thoroughly exposing their counter-revolutionary faces is the battle task and main content of Shanghai's street big-character poster columns. Many big-character poster columns publish articles such as "Smash the Philosophy of the Traitor, Smash the Traitor Gang," "Denounce the Class Capitulationism of China's Khrushchev," "Thoroughly Eliminate the Poison of 'Temperament,'" "Smash the Backstage Boss of the Counter-Revolutionary Revisionist Literary Line," and "Denounce the Great Betrayal of the Two Khrushchevs Abroad," which are substantial in content and sharp in pen, powerfully exposing and criticizing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their evil plots to usurp the Party, usurp political power, and usurp the military.

The Red Guards of colleges and universities and some Little Red Guards of primary schools continue to play a vanguard role in the revolutionary criticism, criticizing the revisionist educational line and exposing the crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in plotting to cultivate revisionist successors. Workers and peasants have further played a leading role in the revolutionary criticism. Workers of the Shanghai Electrochemical Factory denounced in big-character posters the "material incentives" vigorously promoted by China's Khrushchev, pointing out that this is a "sugar-coated shell" to corrupt workers, making them focus on production without politics, pursuing only personal immediate interests, forgetting the collective and national long-term interests, forgetting class struggle, and forgetting the dictatorship of the proletariat. A revolutionary fighter in a factory denounced in a big-character poster the fallacies peddled by China's Khrushchev about "exploitation is meritorious" and "the more workers are exploited, the more comfortable they feel," pointing out that this is the "voice of a thorough bloodsucker," and that "the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and the imperialists, modern revisionists, capitalists, and traitors are of the same ilk."

After the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road recently threw out a "confession" of false repentance and true counterattack, it further aroused the immense anger of Shanghai's proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses. In a few days, countless big-character posters denouncing the "falling dog" and annihilating the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road were posted all over the city. The Revolutionary Rebel Fighting Team of the Shanghai Film Bureau and other units' proletarian revolutionaries emphasized in big-character posters that the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists are not "dead tigers" but man-eating beasts. They are glaring with their eyes and grinding their teeth, ready to eat people at any moment. We must use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to launch a broader and deeper great criticism and great struggle, and thoroughly criticize, overthrow, and denounce them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, making them stink for ten thousand years and never be able to stand up again!

"Following the melon to find the vine, following the vine to dig up the root," the revolutionary criticism is increasingly closely combining with the struggle, criticism, and reform within the unit. Many revolutionary criticism big-character posters on Shanghai streets are written based on the actual class struggle, two roads, and two lines struggle within their department and unit, focusing on key issues and typical events, and are written based on the exposure and criticism within their department and unit. Therefore, these revolutionary criticism big-character posters expose deeply, criticize thoroughly, and refute powerfully. The revolutionary workers and cadres of the Dongfanghong Department Store (formerly Yong'an Company) used a series of big-character posters to denounce the crimes of the number one conspirator within the Party and his agents in Shanghai. This group of conspirators, despite the resistance and opposition of the broad revolutionary workers, praised a reactionary capitalist as a "red capitalist" specimen, protected capitalist interests in every way, handed over the enterprise's power to the capitalist, practiced bourgeois dictatorship over the working class, advocated profit-first, emphasized material incentives, and tried every means to change the direction of commercial work to serve workers, peasants, and soldiers, and carried out a thorough capitalist restoration. They even did not allow changing an old signboard stained with the blood and tears of the working people after the public-private joint operation until it was smashed in this proletarian cultural revolution. The irrefutable facts powerfully exposed the true face of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road as the sons and grandsons of the bourgeoisie.

In the activity of compiling big-character poster columns, the proletarian revolutionaries of various fronts have launched a mass movement, waged a "people's war," and thus better promoted the struggle, criticism, and reform within their unit and powerfully promoted the revolutionary great alliance. The big-character poster column "Thoroughly Criticize the Revisionist Sports Line" compiled by the Lu Xun Brigade of the Revolutionary Rebel Command of the Shanghai Sports Front has been published in four issues, focusing on basketball, tennis, table tennis, and swimming. Before the publication of these four issues of big-character poster columns, the brigade fighters and revolutionary masses first discussed which issues should be exposed and criticized, then divided into groups to expose and criticize, assigned tasks to draft the initial draft, discussed and revised it collectively, and finally copied and posted it. The big-character poster "From the Shanghai Opera 'Marsh Fire' to the Beijing Opera 'Sha Jianhuai' Seeing the Struggle Between the Two Lines on the Literary Front" posted simultaneously in eight places by the Shanghai People's Opera Troupe systematically exposed and criticized the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road within the old Shanghai Municipal Committee, who, following the orders of their masters, colluded with the leaders of the troupe in the process of compiling and revising "Marsh Fire," resisted Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary line, and refused to implement Comrade Jiang Qing's opinions.

Chairman Mao said: "Our Party's newspapers and all the propaganda work we do should be lively, clear, sharp, and never hesitant. This is the fighting style that our revolutionary proletariat should have." Many big-character poster columns on Shanghai streets not only have a firm stance, clear views, and rich content but also have sharp language, and the forms are diverse, with both text and images. The proletarian revolutionaries of the united front system have also, according to the spirit of "thrift for revolution," changed the big-character poster columns into mobile ones that can be hung in different places, saving manpower and materials and achieving greater propaganda effects. Since the revolutionary criticism big-character posters were posted on the streets, they have been warmly welcomed and actively supported by the broad revolutionary masses.

    把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍街头巷尾
    以大字报为武器批臭中国的赫鲁晓夫
    上海无产阶级革命派大办街头革命大字报专栏，把千百万革命群众吸引到革命的大批判中来，使党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派陷入口诛笔伐的人民斗争的汪洋大海
    据新华社上海二十七日电　毛主席教导我们：“大字报是一种极其有用的新式武器”。上海的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，在当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大决战中，纷纷在街头贴出以革命的大批判为中心内容的大字报，以密集的猛烈的炮火，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发动总攻击。它和各部门、各单位内部的革命大批判汇集成一股强大的革命洪流，使中国的赫鲁晓夫及其一伙陷入了广大革命群众口诛笔伐的人民斗争的汪洋大海中。
    上海街头成片的革命大批判的大字报专栏，是宣传毛泽东思想的一个坚强阵地，是围歼党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的重要战场，是上海无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众坚持斗争大方向的一大成果，是革命的大批判推动本地区、本单位的斗批改日益深入发展的又一标志。从战斗的红五月开始到现在，街头的革命大批判的大字报专栏，数量越来越多。从文艺、教育、出版等少数战线，发展到工业、财贸、新闻、体育、卫生、工会工作、青年工作、统战工作、侨务工作、园林绿化工作等各条战线，并且一般都有自己固定的阵地。写大字报的人越来越广泛，不仅有工人、贫下中农、解放军指战员、红卫兵小将、革命干部、革命的知识分子、店员，而且有红小兵和里弄干部。地区也越来越扩大，原来主要张贴在南京路等主要街道，现在扩展到全市的街头巷尾。革命大字报专栏，把千百万革命群众吸引到革命大批判的斗争中来。那些打“内战”的大字报和宣传品，不仅数量越来越少，而且被挤到旁边，越来越没有多少观众了。
    热情宣传毛泽东思想，宣传以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，宣传党的方针政策，是上海街头革命大字报的一个共同特色。许多无产阶级革命派战士体会到：街头巷尾同样是重要的斗争阵地。无产阶级思想不去占领这些阵地，资产阶级思想就会去占领它。更多更好地举办大字报专栏，就是要把毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍街头巷尾。大字报专栏是不是突出无产阶级政治，革命大批判能不能击中要害，就是对无产阶级革命派有没有认真学习和深刻领会毛泽东思想的一种考试。街头的革命大字报专栏，一般都把精心绘制的毛主席像安排在最显著的地位，选登毛主席的有关语录，作为每期专栏的指导思想。不少大字报专栏，还认真编辑了毛主席的专题语录和党中央的方针政策，帮助广大群众比较系统地领会毛主席的光辉思想和党中央的政策精神，更好地掌握和运用革命大批判这一强大的武器。最近以来，上海各条战线都掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，复课闹革命，抓革命，促生产，革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，都在胜利发展。街头的大字报专栏，不仅及时反映了这样一派大好形势，而且起了交流情况、交流经验的作用，真正成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争。”
    奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，集中火力对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，戳穿他们的反革命阴谋，猛攻他们的要害，彻底暴露他们的反革命嘴脸，这是上海街头大字报专栏的战斗任务和主要内容。许多大字报专栏中刊登的《打倒叛徒哲学，砸烂叛徒集团》、《痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫的阶级投降主义》、《彻底肃清〈修养〉的流毒》、《打倒反革命修正主义文艺黑线的总后台》、《声讨两个赫鲁晓夫的出国大叛卖》等等批判文章，内容扎实，笔锋锐利，有力地揭露和批判了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派妄图篡党、篡政、篡军的罪恶阴谋。
    大中学校的红卫兵和一些小学的红小兵，在革命大批判中英姿不减，继续起着先锋作用。他们狠批修正主义的教育路线，揭露了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派阴谋培养修正主义接班人的罪行。工农兵在革命大批判中进一步发挥了主力军的作用。上海电化厂工人在大字报中，痛斥中国的赫鲁晓夫大力推行的“物质刺激”，指出这是“腐蚀工人的糖衣炮弹”，是要工人埋头生产，不问政治，单纯追求个人的眼前利益，忘记集体和国家的长远利益，忘记阶级斗争，忘记无产阶级专政。一个工厂的革命派战士在大字报中，批驳了中国赫鲁晓夫所贩卖的资本家“剥削有功”和“剥削多了”工人“就越感到舒服”的谬论，指出这是“十足的吸血鬼的声音”，“党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和帝国主义者、现代修正主义者、资本家、工贼等是一类货色”。
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派最近抛出了假认罪、真反扑的“检查”书以后，更加激起了上海的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的无比愤怒。几天之间，无数痛打“落水狗”、围歼党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的革命大字报，就贴遍了全市各个角落。上海市电影局机关革命造反战斗团和其他单位的无产阶级革命派，在大字报中强调指出：党内头号走资本主义道路当权派和一小撮反革命修正主义分子不是什么“死老虎”，而是吃人的野兽，他们正瞪着眼，磨着牙，时刻准备吃人。我们一定要以毛泽东思想为武器，开展更广泛、更深入的大批判、大斗争，从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们彻底批倒、批垮、批臭，叫他们遗臭万年，永世不得翻身！
    “顺瓜摸藤，顺藤挖根”，革命的大批判正在同本单位的斗批改日益紧密地结合起来，在革命的大批判中不断地提高斗批改的水平。上海街头革命大批判的大字报，不少就是从本部门、本单位两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的实际出发，抓住重点问题和典型事件，在本部门、本单位的揭发批判的基础上写出来的。因此，这些革命大批判的大字报揭得深，批得透，驳斥得有力。东方红百货商店（原永安公司）的革命职工和革命干部，用一系列大字报痛斥党内头号野心家及其在上海的代理人的罪行。这伙野心家不顾广大革命职工的抵制和反对，把一个反动资本家吹捧为“红色资本家”的活标本，百般维护资产阶级利益，把企业大权交给资本家，对工人阶级实行资产阶级专政，推行利润挂帅，强调物质刺激，千方百计篡改商业工作为工农兵服务的方向，大搞资本主义复辟，甚至连一块沾满劳动人民血泪的旧招牌，在公私合营之后都不准改变，直到这次无产阶级文化大革命中才被砸掉。雄辩的事实，有力地揭露了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派是资产阶级孝子贤孙的本来面目。
    各条战线的无产阶级革命派在编写大字报专栏的活动中，大搞群众运动，打了一场“人民战争”，从而使革命的大批判更好地推动了本单位的斗批改，有力地促进了革命的大联合。上海体育战线革命造反司令部鲁迅兵团编写的《彻底批判修正主义体育路线》的大字报专栏，已先后分篮球、网球、乒乓球、游泳等四个运动项目，出版了四期专栏。这四期大字报专栏出版之前，兵团战士和革命群众先讨论应该揭发批判哪些问题，然后分组进行揭发批判，分工执笔写成初稿，再集体讨论修改，最后才誊抄张贴出去。上海人民沪剧团在八个地方同时贴出的大字报：《从沪剧〈芦荡火种〉到京剧〈沙家浜〉看文艺战线两条道路的斗争》，系统地揭发和批判了旧上海市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，秉承他们主子的旨意，勾结剧团的领导，在编演、修改《芦荡火种》过程中，对抗毛主席的革命文艺路线，拒不执行江青同志意见的罪行。这个问题的揭发批判，是人民沪剧团几个革命群众组织在初步联合的基础上开展起来的。
    毛主席说：“我们党所办的报纸，我们党所进行的一切宣传工作，都应当是生动的，鲜明的，尖锐的，毫不吞吞吐吐。这是我们革命无产阶级应有的战斗风格。”上海街头的许多革命大字报专栏，不但立场坚定，观点鲜明，内容丰富，而且文字尖锐，形式上图文并茂，编排多样。统战系统的无产阶级革命派还根据“要节约闹革命”的精神，把大字报专栏改成活动的，可以换地方张挂，既节约人力物力，又收到更大的宣传效果。革命大批判的大字报贴上街头以来，一直受到广大革命群众的热情欢迎和积极支持。
