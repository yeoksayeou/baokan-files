“Organize millions of people, mobilize a vast revolutionary army, this is the need of today’s revolution to attack the counter-revolutionaries.” In this current, magnificent, mass-based revolutionary criticism movement, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and hundreds of millions of revolutionary people across the country, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, have united, raised the banner of revolution, and launched an unprecedented scale of people’s struggle. They are carrying out a massive attack and comprehensive settlement of accounts with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with the Chinese Khrushchev as their representative.

The proletarian revolutionaries in various places have expressed: We must unite all those who can be united, mobilize all active forces that can be mobilized, concentrate our firepower, pursue relentlessly, and beat down, overthrow, and expose those venomous scoundrels politically, ideologically, and theoretically, making them infamous for eternity, never to rise again, to consolidate our great proletarian dictatorship and forever safeguard the proletarian iron mountain from changing color!

The proletarian revolutionaries on various fronts in Beijing, Shanghai, Jinan, Xining, Qingdao, and other places are, with the revolutionary spirit of “seizing the day,” consciously and actively uniting, and throwing themselves into the current revolutionary criticism battle. The revolutionary great alliance on the industrial and transportation, cultural, educational, news, agricultural, forestry, and financial and trade fronts in Beijing has made new progress in recent days, presenting a gratifying new situation. Many colleges and universities that previously had differences among revolutionary organizations are eliminating these differences through criticism and gradually uniting. Some schools have already established joint command departments for struggle, criticism, and transformation. After the two revolutionary organizations of Beijing Normal University established a joint headquarters in mid-July, the entire school quickly launched a high tide of criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique. In Shanghai, the birthplace of the “January Revolution,” the revolutionary criticism is rapidly promoting revolutionary great unity, and the revolutionary great unity is strongly promoting revolutionary criticism. Unprincipled “internal wars” have stopped in many units, and mutual attack big-character posters have been torn down. The broad revolutionary masses are united in their hatred of the enemy, directing their struggle at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. On the financial and trade front in Shanghai, ten district-level revolutionary mass organizations have already achieved a revolutionary great unity with the leftists as the core, and in more than 200 district-level professional companies, banks, tax bureaus, and other units, the vast majority have achieved revolutionary great unity. The tens of thousands of revolutionary workers and revolutionary cadres on the financial and trade front in the entire city have already formed an invincible revolutionary army in the revolutionary criticism movement.

The proletarian revolutionaries in Harbin, Beijing, Guiyang, Taiyuan, Hohhot, and other places pointed out that revolutionary criticism is the top priority battle task at present, a matter of the utmost importance concerning the future of our country and the fate of the world. Rapidly achieving revolutionary great unity is an urgent need of the revolution, an urgent need of Chairman Mao’s great strategic deployment. They said, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are still alive, their hearts are not dead, and they are always watching for opportunities, trying to make a comeback. With the enemy at the gate, we proletarian revolutionaries must unite, do a good job in revolutionary criticism, and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The revolutionary youngsters of Jinan No. 34 Middle School, who have united and actively participated in the revolutionary criticism, said: This contradiction, that contradiction, the contradiction between us and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is the principal contradiction. We must closely unite, firmly grasp this principal contradiction, concentrate our forces, focus our targets, and fiercely attack the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Otherwise, it would be the greatest betrayal of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In Shuangyashan City, Heilongjiang Province, 21 out of 42 units have achieved and consolidated revolutionary great unity in the criticism. The proletarian revolutionaries of this city said with great enthusiasm, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are the most dangerous enemies of the people nationwide. Whoever, for the sake of small-group interests, puts the enemy aside and is eager to fight “internal wars,” will commit a grave error and become a criminal of history!

The revolutionary youngsters of the Jinggangshan Detachment at Tsinghua University pointed out, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are our biggest enemies. If we relax our vigilance against the enemy, then one day, these guys will make a comeback and carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration. They will arrest anyone who has rebelled against them, regardless of which faction they are from within the revolutionary ranks! With the enemy at the gate, we proletarian revolutionaries have a thousand and one reasons to unite, and no reason to split and fight “internal wars.”

Many places’ proletarian revolutionaries also emphasized that they must, in the revolutionary criticism movement, better study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, overcome selfishness and establish public spirit, overthrow selfishness, and remove obstacles to quickly achieving revolutionary great unity. They pointed out, the biggest obstacle to the great unity of the revolutionary factions is, after all, the “self.” The day we overthrow the “self” is the day we achieve revolutionary great unity. The more than ten revolutionary mass organizations of the Beijing Peking Opera Troupe studied Chairman Mao’s brilliant works such as “On Rectifying the Party’s Erroneous Thoughts” seriously, kicked out the “self,” overthrew the “I,” and finally achieved great unity, raising the revolutionary criticism to a higher level. The four revolutionary mass organizations of Qingdao Four-Square Locomotive Factory, with the help of the People’s Liberation Army comrades, recently studied Chairman Mao’s great work “On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People” seriously. Everyone actively engaged in self-criticism, eliminated estrangement, and finally united, establishing a unified revolutionary organization for the entire factory, pushing the revolutionary criticism and struggle-criticism-transformation of this unit to a new high.

    各地无产阶级革命派自觉地实现大联合
    向中国的赫鲁晓夫展开总攻击和总清算
    新华社二十八日讯　“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”在当前这场波澜壮阔的群众性的革命大批判运动中，各地广大无产阶级革命派和亿万革命群众，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下联合起来，高举革命的批判旗帜，正在掀起一场空前规模的人民斗争，向以中国的赫鲁晓夫为总代表的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开声势浩大的总攻击和总清算。
    各地无产阶级革命派表示：一定要团结一切可以团结的人们，调动一切可以调动的积极力量，集中火力，穷追猛打，把那一伙象毒蛇一样的恶人从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒、批垮、批臭，让他们遗臭万年，永世不得翻身，以巩固我们伟大的无产阶级专政，永保无产阶级的铁打江山不变颜色！
    北京、上海、济南、西宁、青岛等地各条战线上的许多无产阶级革命派，正以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，自觉地、积极地联合起来，投入到当前这场革命大批判的战斗中去。北京工业交通、文艺、教育、新闻、农林、财贸等战线上的革命大联合，近日来都有了新的进展，出现了可喜的新形势。不少大中学校里过去有分歧的革命组织，正在通过大批判消除分歧，逐步走向联合，有些学校已经成立了共同进行斗批的指挥部。北京师范学院两大革命派组织在七月中旬成立联合总部以后，全校迅速掀起了对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和彭真反革命修正主义集团的大批判、大斗争高潮。在“一月革命”发源地的上海，革命的大批判正在迅速推进革命的大联合，革命的大联合又强有力地推进了革命的大批判。不少单位无原则的“内战”停止了，相互攻击的大字报撕掉了，广大革命群众同仇敌忾，把斗争矛头一致对准了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。上海财贸战线已经有十个区一级的革命群众组织全部实现了以左派为核心的革命大联合，在二百多个区级专业公司和银行、税务局等单位中，绝大多数都实现了革命大联合。全市财贸战线上的几十万革命职工和革命干部，已经在革命的大批判运动中结成了一支无坚不摧的革命大军。
    哈尔滨、北京、贵阳、太原、呼和浩特等地的无产阶级革命派指出，革命的大批判是当前压倒一切的战斗任务，是关系到我国前途和世界命运的头等大事。迅速实现革命的大联合，这是革命的迫切需要，是毛主席的伟大战略部署的迫切需要。他们说，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派人还在，心不死，时时刻刻都在窥测方向，妄图卷土重来。大敌当前，我们无产阶级革命派一定要联合起来，搞好革命的大批判，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    已经联合起来积极投入革命的大批判的济南第三十四中学的革命小将们说：这矛盾，那矛盾，我们同党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾，才是最主要的矛盾。我们必须紧密地联合起来，牢牢地抓住这个主要矛盾，集中力量，集中目标，对准中国的赫鲁晓夫以及党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，否则就是对无产阶级文化大革命最大的背叛。
    黑龙江省双鸭山市四十二个单位，已经有二十一个单位在大批判中实现和巩固了革命的大联合。这个市的无产阶级革命派满怀激情地说，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是全国人民最危险的敌人，谁要是为小团体的利益，把敌人放在一边，热衷于打“内战”，谁就要犯绝大的错误，成为历史的罪人！
    清华大学井冈山兵团的革命小将指出，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派是我们最大的死敌。如果我们对敌人放松了警惕，那么，有朝一日，这些家伙卷土重来，实行反革命复辟，凡是造他们反的都要抓，他才不管你是革命派里的哪一派呢！大敌当前，我们无产阶级革命派有千条万条理由联合起来，没有一条理由闹分裂，打“内战”。
    许多地方的无产阶级革命派还着重表示，一定要在革命的大批判运动中更好地活学活用毛主席著作，破私立公，打倒私字，为尽快地实现革命的大联合扫除障碍。他们指出，革命派之间实现大联合的最大障碍，说到底就是一个“私”字。打倒“私”字之日，也就是实现革命大联合之时。北京京剧一团的十几个革命群众组织，认真地学习了毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，踢开“私”字，打倒“我”字，终于实现了大联合，把革命的大批判提到了更高的水平。青岛四方机车厂四个革命群众组织，最近在人民解放军同志的帮助下，认真学习了毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这一伟大著作，大家主动作自我批评，消除隔阂，终于联合起来，成立全厂统一的革命组织，把革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改推向了新的高潮。
