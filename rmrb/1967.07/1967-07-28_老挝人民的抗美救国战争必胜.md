The patriotic military and civilian people of Laos, under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, are bravely and tenaciously fighting against American imperialism and its lackeys, achieving one brilliant victory after another.

The patriotic military and civilian people of Laos have repeatedly foiled the "sweeping" and "gnawing" attacks of American imperialism and its lackeys, consolidating the liberated areas. The coordination between the main forces, local forces, and guerrilla units of the Lao people has become tighter, and the people's guerrilla warfare has developed extensively across the country, forming a net that surrounds, restrains, and wears down the enemy's combat effectiveness. In just the first five months of this year, nearly five thousand enemy troops have been annihilated.

The patriotic military and civilian people of Laos have shattered the boasted "air superiority" of American imperialism. Over the years, they have not only shot down more than six hundred American aircraft with various light and heavy weapons but have also repeatedly launched surprise attacks on the airfields of the American puppet forces. Recently, the Lao guerrilla forces launched a fierce assault on the Luang Prabang airfield, destroying twelve American-made bombers in just twenty minutes of battle.

The patriotic armed forces of Laos have rapidly grown and strengthened in the fight. The Lao People's Liberation Army, tempered and tested by the fires of war, has become a powerful people's army.

The victory of the Lao people's war of resistance against America for national salvation is a victory of the people's war. It proves that oppressed nations and peoples, as long as they grasp this effective weapon of people's war, can completely defeat American imperialism and its lackeys.

The excellent situation of the Lao people's revolutionary struggle was won with guns. For the sake of independence and liberation, the Lao people have fought for a long time. In the twists and turns of the struggle, they not only defended the fruits of the revolution but also continuously strengthened their own forces.

American imperialism has been scheming to turn Laos into its colony and military base. For many years, it has increasingly brazenly carried out military intervention and aggression against Laos, from directing the right-wing forces of Laos to attack the liberated areas to directly participating in the "special war" in Laos. The aggressive activities of American imperialism in Laos show that it is the most brutal aggressor and the sworn enemy of the Lao people.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "No one will believe that a piece of paper will make American imperialism lay down its butcher's knife and instantly become a Buddha, or become a bit more disciplined." The criminal acts of American imperialism in invading Laos completely prove this unshakable truth. On the issue of Laos, two Geneva Agreements have been signed, but both agreements have been thoroughly destroyed by American imperialism. This fact clearly tells people that for imperialism, any treaty, agreement, or convention is nothing but a piece of waste paper. They can tear it to shreds today and kick it away tomorrow; they can sign an agreement in the morning and trample it in the afternoon. Therefore, one must not pin hopes on imperialism keeping its promises or respecting international agreements, but must insist on fighting imperialism and its lackeys tooth and nail, and be ready at any time to counter the enemy's armed attacks.

In the criminal activities of American imperialism interfering with and invading Laos, the Soviet revisionist clique has played a shameful role as an accomplice. It has been deceiving the Lao people with false support and true betrayal, collaborating closely with American imperialism to spread illusions about the Geneva Agreement, attempting to lull the fighting spirit of the Lao people, and under the pretext of "eliminating the source of war," trying to extinguish the armed struggle of the patriotic military and civilian people of Laos against American imperialism and its lackeys. The Soviet revisionist clique is actually encouraging American imperialism to gradually expand its war of aggression against Laos.

Currently, American imperialism, in order to salvage the defeat of its war of aggression against Vietnam, is hastily plotting new and larger-scale military adventures in Laos. The recent statement issued by the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front calls on the Lao people to further unite and resolutely fight against the plans of American imperialism and its lackeys to expand the war of aggression. In the face of the heroic Lao people, no matter how American imperialism struggles, it cannot escape its ultimate failure. The Lao people have the determination and strength to persist in a long-term war, to carry out the just struggle of resistance against America for national salvation to the end, to thoroughly defeat the American aggressors and their lackeys, and to achieve the unity, democracy, and independence of Laos.

In the struggle against American imperialism, the Chinese people will forever be a reliable and strong backbone for the Lao people. The Chinese people will firmly and unreservedly support the Lao people's war of resistance against America for national salvation until they thoroughly defeat the American aggressors and achieve final victory.

The Lao people will surely win! American imperialism and its lackeys will surely fail!

    老挝人民的抗美救国战争必胜
    本报评论员
    老挝爱国军民，在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，正在同美帝国主义及其走狗进行着英勇顽强的战斗，取得一个又一个光辉的胜利。
    老挝爱国军民不断地粉碎美帝国主义及其走狗的“扫荡”和“蚕食”进攻，巩固了解放区。老挝人民的主力部队、地方部队和游击队之间的配合更加紧密，人民游击战争在全国范围内有了广泛的发展，形成了一个包围、牵制和消耗敌人有生力量的天罗地网。仅仅今年头五个月，就歼灭了敌人近五千名。
    老挝爱国军民挫败了美帝国主义吹嘘的“空中优势”。几年来，他们不仅用各种轻重武器，打下了美国六百多架飞机，而且不断奇袭美伪军的机场。最近，老挝游击队猛袭琅勃拉邦机场，二十分钟的战斗，就炸毁了美制轰炸机十二架。
    老挝爱国武装力量在战斗中迅速成长和壮大。老挝人民解放军经受了战火的锻炼和考验，已经成为一支强大的人民军队。
    老挝人民抗美救国战争的胜利，是人民战争的胜利。它证明被压迫民族和被压迫人民只要掌握人民战争这个有效的法宝，美帝国主义及其走狗是完全可以打败的。
    老挝人民革命斗争的大好局面，是靠枪杆子打出来的。为了争取独立和解放，老挝人民进行了长期的战斗。他们在曲折复杂的斗争中，不仅保卫住了革命的果实，而且不断壮大了自己的力量。
    美帝国主义处心积虑把老挝变成为它的殖民地和军事基地。多年以来，它为了要消灭老挝的爱国武装力量，对老挝进行越来越猖狂的军事干涉和侵略，从指使老挝右派进攻解放区到直接参与在老挝的“特种战争”。美帝国主义在老挝的侵略活动表明，它是最残暴的侵略者，是老挝人民的死敌。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席曾经指出：“谁也不会相信，一纸条约会使美帝国主义放下屠刀，立地成佛，或者变得稍为规矩些。”美帝国主义侵略老挝的罪恶行径，完全证明了这个颠扑不破的真理。在老挝问题上，曾经签订过两个日内瓦协议，但是两个协议都被美帝国主义彻底破坏了。这个事实最清楚地告诉人们，对于帝国主义来说，什么条约、协定、协议，都不过是一些废纸。今天签订条约，明天他们就可以把它撕得粉碎；上午达成协议，下午他们就可以把它一脚踢翻。因此，决不能把希望寄托在帝国主义信守诺言、尊重国际协议上面，而必须坚持同帝国主义及其走狗进行针锋相对的斗争，并且随时准备对付敌人的武装进攻。
    在美帝国主义干涉和侵略老挝的罪恶活动中，苏修集团扮演了可耻的帮凶角色。它对老挝人民大搞假支持、真出卖的勾当，极力同美帝国主义相配合，散布对日内瓦协议的幻想，企图麻痹老挝人民的斗志，并且打着“消灭战争策源地”的幌子，力图扑灭老挝爱国军民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的武装斗争。苏修集团实际上在鼓励美帝国主义一步一步地扩大侵略老挝的战争。
    目前，美帝国主义为了挽救侵越战争的败局，正加紧策划在老挝进行新的更大规模的军事冒险。老挝爱国战线党中央最近发表的公报，号召老挝人民进一步团结起来，为反对美帝国主义及其走狗扩大侵略战争的计划而坚决斗争。在英雄的老挝人民面前，美帝国主义不管怎样进行挣扎，都逃脱不了最后失败的命运。老挝人民有决心、有力量坚持长期抗战，把抗美救国的正义斗争进行到底，彻底打败美国侵略者及其走狗，实现老挝的统一、民主和独立。
    在反对美帝国主义的斗争中，中国人民永远是老挝人民可靠的、坚强的后盾。中国人民坚定不移地全力支援老挝人民的抗美救国斗争，直到他们彻底打败美国侵略者，取得最后的胜利。
    老挝人民必胜！美帝国主义及其走狗必败！
