	The Chinese Embassy and Xinhua News Agency strongly protest the unreasonable expulsion of our journalist by the reactionary government of Burma. Ne Win personally taking action against China exposes the weak nature of the Burmese reactionaries. The Burmese reactionary government expels our journalist out of fear that the heinous crimes of the Burmese reactionaries will be exposed to the world.

	Xinhua News Agency, July 16th: Rangoon News: The Chinese Embassy in Burma sent a note to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 16th, strongly protesting the arbitrary and unreasonable expulsion of Xinhua News Agency journalist Yu Minsheng by the Ne Win reactionary government. The note pointed out that this is another serious step taken by the Burmese reactionary government to further worsen relations between China and Burma. Ne Win is the chief culprit in anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, aiming to sabotage relations between the two countries.

	The note pointed out that the Ne Win reactionary government, for its own domestic and foreign policies, has been following the lead of the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists, acting as their lackeys, and has been carrying out anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. They have deliberately created horrifying fascist atrocities in the history of international relations, pushing the relations between China and Burma to an unprecedentedly deteriorating state. We have repeatedly warned you to stop and not to go down the path of self-destruction, but you have insisted on going your own way, ignoring our serious warnings. The anti-China wave has been getting higher and higher. Our Xinhua News Agency Rangoon branch, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, has clearly distinguished between love and hate, and has reported truthfully on the fascist atrocities you have created, hitting your weak points. You are terrified and hateful. Your reactionary leader Ne Win is even more enraged, personally ordering the expulsion of our Xinhua News Agency journalist Yu Minsheng. Your unreasonable actions do not show your strength but only expose your weakness.

	The note said that Xinhua News Agency journalist Yu Minsheng, during his work in Burma, has always been working to promote friendship between the peoples of China and Burma, and has won the praise of the broad masses of the Burmese people. However, the Burmese reactionary government has openly come out against him. It is laughable that whether it is your leader Ne Win or your Immigration and Registration Department, they cannot come up with any reason for expelling the Xinhua News Agency journalist. Your arrogance and unreasonableness show that you intend to go your own way, to be anti-China and anti-Chinese to the end, and to completely sabotage the relations between the two countries. Your expulsion of the Xinhua News Agency journalist shows that you are extremely afraid of the friendship between the peoples of China and Burma, extremely afraid of the truth, and extremely afraid that your heinous crimes will be exposed to the world.

	The note emphasized that you have recently made a big deal out of your note of July 11th, trying to deny that this anti-China and anti-Chinese movement was planned by you. However, before the ink on your note has dried, your reactionary leader Ne Win has jumped out, personally issuing orders to expel the Xinhua News Agency journalist. This completely exposes your lies and fully proves that your reactionary leader Ne Win personally planned, organized, and directed this anti-China and anti-Chinese movement. He is the chief culprit in anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, aiming to sabotage relations between China and Burma. Now, your fox's tail has been caught by us, and you cannot run away or deny it.

	The note warned the Ne Win reactionary government: Since you have decided to completely sabotage relations between China and Burma, bring out all your tricks! The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not afraid of your tricks.

	Xinhua News Agency, July 16th: The Xinhua News Agency issued a statement on the 16th, strongly protesting the evil act of the Burmese reactionary government in unreasonably ordering the Xinhua News Agency's Rangoon branch journalist Yu Minsheng to leave Burma within a specified time.

	The statement said that the Burmese Ne Win reactionary government, on July 14th, brazenly and unreasonably announced that Xinhua News Agency's Rangoon branch journalist Yu Minsheng must leave Burma by the 17th. This is another serious crime committed by the Ne Win clique, following the instructions of the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists, personally taking action in the crazy anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, aiming to completely sabotage relations between China and Burma. We strongly protest this to the Ne Win reactionary government.

	The statement said that since June 26th, the Burmese reactionary government, while instigating mobs to attack the Chinese Embassy, assassinate Chinese experts, and brutally persecute overseas Chinese, has also incited thousands of mobs to attack the Xinhua News Agency's Rangoon branch four times. The mobs shouted anti-China slogans, cursed and insulted the Xinhua News Agency, smashed display windows, broke into the branch's courtyard, and smashed the glass windows on the first and second floors, acting very arrogantly.

	The statement pointed out that the Burmese reactionaries have always been hostile to the Xinhua News Agency's Rangoon branch. Over the years, they have used various means to restrict the reporting activities of Xinhua News Agency journalists, to make trouble over the residence permits of Xinhua News Agency personnel, to restrict the distribution of Xinhua News Agency news, and to create many difficulties for the normal operation of the Xinhua branch.

	The statement said that the Ne Win reactionary government is extremely hostile to the Xinhua News Agency, and it is not surprising that this time they have unreasonably ordered the Xinhua News Agency's Rangoon branch journalist Yu Minsheng to leave the country without giving any reason.

	The statement emphasized that the Ne Win clique is a fascist clique of dictatorship, betrayal, anti-communism, and anti-people. It crazily massacres the revolutionary people of Burma, living by prisons and butcher knives. It ruthlessly exploits and plunders the working people, causing the economic crisis to become increasingly serious and the people to suffer. It shamelessly sells out national interests, acting as a lackey of the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists, and closely colluding with reactionaries of various countries. It is the greatest traitor of Burma. It has already fallen deeply into the sea of fire of the people's war led by the Communist Party of Burma, trembling with fear and struggling desperately to survive.

	The statement said that the Ne Win reactionary government ordered the Xinhua News Agency's Rangoon branch journalist to leave the country because it is afraid that Chinese journalists will, through their reports, promote mutual understanding and friendship between the peoples of China and Burma, afraid that Chinese journalists will propagate the great Mao Zedong Thought and the Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat that has shaken the world, afraid that Chinese journalists will expose the true face and anti-China actions of the Burmese reactionaries, and afraid that Chinese journalists will report the heroic revolutionary struggle of the Burmese people. However, bayonets cannot seal off the truth, and magic hands cannot cover the sun. The brilliant and invincible Mao Zedong Thought has already entered the hearts of the revolutionary people of Burma, becoming their banner of struggle and victory. The news of the victory of the Burmese people's revolutionary struggle will surely spread all over the world.

	The statement said that the great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "'Lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own feet,' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some foolish people. The reactionaries of various countries are also such a bunch of fools." The evil anti-China and anti-Chinese actions of the Ne Win reactionary government have completely exposed its reactionary nature to the people of Burma and the people of the world, and can only accelerate its doom.

	The statement solemnly declared: The Xinhua News Agency will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, more thoroughly expose the heinous crimes of the Ne Win reactionary clique, more resolutely support the revolutionary struggle of the Burmese people, and strive for the strengthening of revolutionary friendship and combat unity between the peoples of China and Burma. This is our sacred internationalist duty, which no one can stop.

    奈温亲自出马反华暴露缅反动派虚弱本质
    缅甸反动政府驱逐我记者是害怕把缅甸反动派的滔天罪行公诸于世
    新华社十六日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆十六日照会缅甸外交部，最强烈地抗议奈温反动政府横蛮无理地驱逐新华社记者于民生，指出这是缅甸反动政府蓄意进一步恶化中缅两国关系的又一严重步骤，奈温就是反华排华、破坏中缅两国关系的罪魁祸首。
    照会指出，奈温反动政府为了自己内政外交的需要，一味追随美帝苏修，甘当他们的走卒，大肆反华排华，蓄意制造了国际关系史上骇人听闻的法西斯暴行，把中缅两国关系推到空前恶化的地步。我们曾一再警告你们必须悬崖勒马，不要自寻死路，但你们却一意孤行，无视我们的严重警告，反华浪潮一浪高过一浪。我新华社仰光分社高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，爱憎分明，对你们制造的法西斯暴行进行了如实的报道，打中了你们的要害，你们怕得要死，恨得要命。你们的反动头子奈温更是暴跳如雷，竟亲自出马下令驱逐我新华社记者于民生。你们这一无理行径，一点不意味着你们的强大，只能暴露你们的虚弱的本质。
    照会说，新华社记者于民生在缅甸工作期间，一直为促进中缅两国人民的友谊而工作，博得了缅甸广大人民的赞扬，而缅甸反动政府却公开跳出来反对他。令人可笑的是不管是你们的头子奈温，也不管是你们的移民和户籍部，竟然都提不出一点驱逐新华社记者的理由，你们这样蛮横无理，说明了你们要一意孤行，反华排华到底，彻底破坏两国关系。你们驱逐新华社记者，说明你们极端害怕中缅两国人民友好，极端害怕真理，极端害怕你们的滔天罪恶被公诸于世。
    照会着重指出，你们最近对你们七月十一日的来照大作文章，妄图否认这次反华排华运动是你们一手策划的。但是，你们照会的墨迹未干，你们的反动头子奈温就跳了出来，亲自发号施令驱逐新华社记者。这就彻底拆穿了你们的谎言，充分证明你们的反动头子奈温亲自策划、组织和指挥了这次反华排华运动。他就是反华排华、破坏中缅两国关系的罪魁祸首。现在，你们的狐狸尾巴被我们揪住了，你们想跑是跑不掉的，想赖也是办不到的。
    照会正告奈温反动政府：你们既然下了决心要把中缅关系彻底破坏，你们还有什么法宝就都拿出来吧！用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，对于你们这两下子根本不在话下。
    新华社十六日讯　中国新华通讯社十六日发表声明，最最强烈抗议缅甸反动政府无理限期要新华社驻仰光分社记者于民生离开缅甸的罪恶行动。
    声明说，缅甸奈温反动政府七月十四日悍然无理宣布，限期要中国新华通社驻仰光分社记者于民生在十七日离开缅甸，这是奈温集团秉承美帝和苏修的意旨，亲自出马在疯狂反华、排华、彻底破坏中缅两国关系方面，犯下的又一新的严重罪行。对此，我们向奈温反动政府提出最最强烈的抗议。
    声明说，从六月二十六日开始，缅甸反动政府在策动暴徒袭击中国大使馆、刺杀中国专家和野蛮迫害华侨的同时，纵容上千名暴徒四次冲击新华社驻仰光分社。暴徒们狂叫反华口号，谩骂和污辱新华社，捣毁展览橱窗，破门冲进分社院子，砸碎一、二楼玻璃窗，十分猖狂。
    声明指出，缅甸反动派敌视新华社驻仰光分社是一贯的。多年来，他们曾采取各种办法限制新华社记者的采访活动，在新华社人员的居留许可证问题上进行刁难，限制新华社新闻稿的发行，给新华分社工作的正常进行制造很多困难。
    声明说，奈温反动政府极端仇视新华社，这次没有提出任何理由而悍然限期新华社驻仰光分社记者于民生离境，是毫不奇怪的。
    声明强调说，奈温集团是一伙独裁、卖国、反共、反人民的法西斯集团，它疯狂屠杀缅甸革命人民，靠监狱和屠刀过日子。它残酷剥削和掠夺劳动人民，造成经济危机日益严重，民不聊生。它无耻出卖民族利益，充当美帝、苏修的走卒，同各国反动派紧密勾结，是缅甸最大的卖国贼。它已经深深陷入缅甸共产党领导的人民战争的火海之中，胆战心惊，正在作垂死的挣扎。
    声明说，奈温反动当局限期新华社驻仰光分社记者离境，是因为它害怕中国记者通过报道增进中缅两国人民的相互了解和友谊，害怕中国记者宣传伟大的毛泽东思想和震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命，害怕中国记者揭露缅甸反动派的真面目和反华暴行，害怕中国记者报道缅甸人民英勇的革命斗争。但是，刺刀封锁不了真理，魔掌遮不住太阳。光辉的战无不胜的毛泽东思想已深入缅甸革命人民的心中，成为他们战斗和胜利的旗帜。缅甸人民革命斗争的胜利消息，必将传遍全球。
    声明说，伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”奈温反动政府疯狂反华排华的罪恶行径，在缅甸人民和全世界人民面前彻底暴露了它的反动本质，只能加速它的灭亡。
    声明最后庄严宣告：新华通讯社将更高地举起毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，更彻底地揭露奈温反动集团的滔天罪行，更坚决地支援缅甸人民的革命斗争，为加强中缅两国人民的革命友谊和战斗团结而努力奋斗。这是我们天经地义的国际主义义务，是任何人阻挡不了的。
