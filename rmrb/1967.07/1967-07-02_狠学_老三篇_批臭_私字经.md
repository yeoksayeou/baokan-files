Our dearest and most beloved Red Sun, Chairman Mao, teaches us in "The Three Constantly Read Articles" to serve the people wholeheartedly and selflessly, to be selfless and dedicated to others, and to establish a proletarian worldview of serving the Chinese people and the people of the world wholeheartedly. However, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party openly opposes the brilliant thoughts of Mao Zedong, vigorously promotes bourgeois individualism, and wants us to establish a bourgeois worldview of "if you don't look out for yourself, heaven and earth will destroy you." He is the head of the "Private Store." The book "Cultivation" is full of "self" on every page, with a black line of "self" running through the entire book. It is a thoroughly reactionary and soul-poisoning "Scripture of Selfishness."

"Cultivation" subtly promotes bourgeois individualism and maliciously "educates" us to have a "public-private partnership" in our minds. It falsely claims that "personal interests must be taken care of, without personal interests there would be no collective interests, and personal interests combined together are collective interests." These lies are like a knife wrapped in cotton, soft to the touch but deadly. Everyone knows that "public" and "private" are like water and fire, how can they sit on the same bench? When faced with a situation, is it for the revolution or for oneself? Is it for the public or for the private? This is a fundamental question of whether one is revolutionary or not, and it cannot be vague.

Last winter, when a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party were spreading the counterrevolutionary wind of economism, we poor and lower-middle peasants followed Chairman Mao's teachings of "being prepared for war, prepared for famine, and serving the people" and sold over ninety percent of the grain from our bumper harvest to the state and increased collective reserves. According to the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, the private plot should be personal freedom, right? One can plant whatever they want! However, we poor and lower-middle peasants read Chairman Mao's books and learned the spirit of "having no self-interest." We fought against the selfish tendency of thinking about ourselves first and others second. Everything is done for the people's interests, not for personal interests. No household in the production team determined what to plant in their private plot based on their own needs, but rather based on the needs of the revolution. To increase production, we need fertilizer, so we used over eighty percent of our private plot to plant feed and raise pigs to solve the fertilizer problem through self-reliance.

These are the results of studying "The Three Constantly Read Articles" and replacing selfishness with a red heart. If we followed the "Scripture of Selfishness" to "cultivate" ourselves, we would increase the rations of the collective's increased production grain without limit and plant cash crops in our private plots. Capitalist tendencies would run wild, and we would fall into the quagmire of individualism.

Chairman Mao said: "The proletariat wants to change the world according to its worldview, and the bourgeoisie also wants to change the world according to its worldview." We poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao the most. The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party wants us to change the world according to his bourgeois worldview, which is a foolish dream! We poor and lower-middle peasants have only one mind, which is to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. We will study and apply "The Three Constantly Read Articles," which are filled with a red line of "public," to thoroughly criticize and change the "private" in our minds, thoroughly reform our worldview, and thoroughly bury individualism. Let Mao Zedong Thought occupy our entire ideological battlefield.

### 狠学“老三篇”　批臭“私字经”

　　狠学“老三篇”　批臭“私字经”
　　洪泾大队第四生产队政治队长　李树松
    我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席在“老三篇”中教导我们，要完全、彻底为人民服务，要毫不利己专门利人，要树立全心全意为中国人民和世界人民服务的无产阶级世界观。可是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，公然反对光辉的毛泽东思想，大肆提倡资产阶级个人主义，要我们树立
  “人不为己、天诛地灭”的资产阶级世界观。他是“私”字大黑店的总老板。《修养》上左一个“自己”，右一个“自己”，整本书贯穿着一条“私”字的黑线。这是一本反动透顶的、毒害人们灵魂的“私字经”。
    《修养》转弯抹角地提倡资产阶级个人主义，别有用心地“教育”我们在头脑里搞“公私合营”。它胡说什么“个人利益一定要照顾，没有个人利益即无整体利益，个人利益集中起来即是整体利益”。这些黑话，是一把包在棉花絮里的刀子，看看软绵绵，杀人不见血。谁都知道，“公”和“私”是水火不相容的一对老冤家，它们怎么能坐在一条板凳上呢？一事当前，是为革命，还是为自己？是为公，还是为私？这是革命不革命的原则问题，决不能含含糊糊。
    去年冬天，正当党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派刮起反革命经济主义黑风的时候，我们贫下中农照毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的教导，将大丰收增产的粮食，百分之九十以上卖给国家和增加集体储备。自留地，照党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的说法，应该是个人自由，自己想种什么就可以种什么了吧！但是，我们贫下中农读了毛主席的书，学习了“毫无自私自利之心的精神”，斗掉了遇到事情先替自己打算，然后才替人家打算的私心。一切从人民的利益出发，不从个人的利益出发。全生产队没有一户根据自己的需要来确定自留田里种什么，而是根据革命的需要确定种什么。增产需要肥料，我们就用百分之八十以上的自留地种饲料，大力发展养猪，自力更生地解决肥料问题。
    这些，都是学习“老三篇”，丢掉私心换红心的效果。如果按照那本“私字经”去“修养”，我们就会把集体增产的粮食无限制地增加社员口粮，就会在自留地上种能够多卖钞票的经济作物。资本主义倾向就要自由泛滥，我们就要陷入个人主义的泥坑。
    毛主席说：“无产阶级要按照自己的世界观改造世界，资产阶级也要按照自己的世界观改造世界”。我们贫下中农最听毛主席的话。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，要我们按他的资产阶级世界观改造世界，那是痴心妄想！我们贫下中农只有一个心眼，就是按毛主席的指示办事，狠学狠用贯穿着一根“公”字红线的“老三篇”，大造头脑中“私”字的反，彻底改造世界观，彻底埋葬个人主义，让毛泽东思想占领我们的整个思想阵地。
