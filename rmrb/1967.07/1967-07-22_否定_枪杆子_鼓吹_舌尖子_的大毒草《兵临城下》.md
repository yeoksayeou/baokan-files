The victory of the War of Liberation was achieved through the use of guns, not through mere words. History has already given its verdict, as Chairman Mao said: "The primary method and form of the Chinese revolution cannot be peaceful but must be armed."

However, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the question of where the Chinese revolution was heading was a subject of fierce struggle between two lines within the Party. Chairman Mao wisely pointed out: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." Chiang Kai-shek was sharpening his sword, and we too must sharpen ours. Yet, the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party sang a different tune, advocating "solving domestic problems through political means" and promoting the path of parliamentary struggle. In response to this, Chairman Mao sharply pointed out: "The nature of American imperialism and the Kuomintang reactionaries cannot be changed. Those who think that political influence can solve problems are deluded. The only way is to organize forces to fight them and overthrow them." The victory of the War of Liberation was a victory of Chairman Mao's theory of people's war, a great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. This was not only a victory of the people's armed forces over the counter-revolutionary armed forces but also a victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao over the bourgeois right-opportunist line represented by the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party.

The reactionary film "The Enemy at the Gate," set against the backdrop of the War of Liberation, should have used the Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle that "the central task and highest form of the revolution is the armed seizure of power, solving problems through war" as the highest directive for its creation, allowing the audience to deeply understand the importance of armed struggle through artistic images. However, the film's directors went against this "revolutionary principle," placing peaceful struggle above armed struggle, thereby negating armed struggle. This fundamentally deviates from the great truth of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" in Marxism-Leninism and provides an artistic illustration of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of "solving domestic problems through political means" advocated by China's Khrushchev, attributing the victory of the War of Liberation to the "merits" of the bourgeois right-opportunist line represented by the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party.

"The Enemy at the Gate," by its very name, should depict the military struggle between the enemy and us, where our great army is at the gates, capturing the enemy who is like a rat in a trap. However, the film deceitfully changed the focus, portraying the internal power struggle within the enemy's ranks as the main conflict, while depicting the military struggle between the enemy and us as a secondary conflict, placing our army in an even more secondary position. In the film, it is not the mighty military and political power of the people's war that forces Zhao Chongwu to rebel, but a secret telegram sent by Chiang Kai-shek to Hu, the high-ranking official. It is this telegram that brings about the effect of "extremes meet," leading to the liberation of a certain city. This completely denies the decisive leading role of our army's military offensive in the liberation of the city, attributing the victory to Zhao Chongwu's "success" in the internal power struggle within the enemy's ranks.

The film "The Enemy at the Gate" completely erases the decisive role of armed struggle. In the film, our army's military actions are merely insignificant decorations. On the contrary, the noisy birthday banquet, the joyous welcome dance, the calm conversation, and the eloquent speech all indicate that the enemy is not a "rat in a trap" but a "dragon in the sea." Is this not showing that military strikes and the power of guns are useless; that it is not the "gun" but the "tongue" that forces the enemy to rebel?

Under this guiding ideology, a "peace envoy" appears—General Jiang enters the city. As a high-ranking military leader of our army, General Jiang enters the city at a critical moment when Zhao Chongwu's attitude is unclear and internal and external communications are cut off, intending to beg Zhao Chongwu to rebel. He places the liberation of the city on the enemy's "awakening" and "wisdom," and tries to persuade Zhao Chongwu, whose hands are stained with the blood of communists and revolutionary people, to "lay down his butcher's knife and become a Buddha instantly." This is a typical right-opportunist line. It is this political right-opportunism that leads to General Jiang's adventurist actions. Zheng Hanshen says his entry into the city is "too risky," but he laughs heartily and says, "Who would dare to harm me if I visit Zheng Hanshen's home?" Little does he know that the very Zheng Hanshen standing in front of him is his enemy. Yet, Zheng Hanshen not only does not "harm" him but also tries every means to protect him. The sole reason is that General Jiang has a "debt of gratitude" and "sent his son" to him. This portrays the enemy as both "wise" and "rational," everything happening just as General Jiang had estimated, that the enemy can "lay down his butcher's knife and become a Buddha instantly."

Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us: The nature of the reactionaries cannot be changed. They "will never lay down their butcher's knives, they will never become Buddhas, until their annihilation." "Hoping to persuade imperialists and Chinese reactionaries to have good intentions and turn back is impossible. The only way is to organize forces to fight them." The victory of the War of Liberation is a victory of the universal truth of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" in Marxism-Leninism. However, the film, titled "The Enemy at the Gate," has only "persuasion" and no "guns," and openly proclaims that the enemy "can become a Buddha instantly" if they "lay down their butcher's knives," and they indeed become "Buddhas." This attributes the victory fruit gained by the Chinese people through the use of guns to the revisionist "merit book" of "peaceful negotiations" and "parliamentary road." This not only attacks Mao Zedong Thought but also distorts the history of the War of Liberation.

The directors of the film said in the "Afterword" of the eponymous play that "The Enemy at the Gate" mainly draws on the "peaceful liberation" of Changchun.

Was the liberation of Changchun truly "peaceful"? No, it was not. Since the winter of 1947, Changchun had been surrounded by the Northeast People's Liberation Army. On October 19, 1948, in the situation where our army captured Jinzhou and the entire Northeast enemy was shaken, the enemy was forced to lay down their weapons. Chairman Mao once scientifically expounded on the significant changes in the overall domestic political and military situation during this historical period. In the brilliant document "Declaration of the Chinese People's Liberation Army," he pointed out: "After defeating Chiang Kai-shek's offensive, the Chinese People's Liberation Army is now launching a counteroffensive on a large scale. In the south, our army is advancing towards the Yangtze River basin; in the north, our army is advancing towards the China-Changchun and North-Ning railways. Wherever our army goes, the enemy flees in disarray, and the people cheer. The overall situation between the enemy and us has fundamentally changed compared to a year ago." He also pointed out in the brilliant work "The Great Change in China's Military Situation": "China's military situation has now reached a new turning point, that is, the balance of power between the two sides of the war has fundamentally changed. The People's Liberation Army not only has long since been superior in quality but also now has the advantage in quantity. This is a sign that the success of the Chinese revolution and the realization of peace in China are imminent." "The Declaration of the Chinese People's Liberation Army" was written in October 1947, just before our army surrounded Changchun; "The Great Change in China's Military Situation" was written in November 1948, soon after our army liberated Changchun. This means that Changchun was surrounded by our army under the historical condition that the overall situation between the enemy and us had undergone a "fundamental change"; it was "peacefully liberated" under the historical condition that the balance of power between the two sides of the war had undergone a "fundamental change." It was the liberation of Jinzhou that forced part of the enemy in Changchun to rebel and the rest to surrender. Clearly, without the strong armed forces of our army as a backing, without the threat of our army's fierce military strikes, there would be no "peaceful liberation" of Changchun. The primary factor is not "peaceful persuasion" but military strikes. Changchun is like this, and the liberation of other places is no different. The directors, however, place peaceful persuasion above military strikes, even distorting history to create "precedents." This is 100% revisionism. The crux of the matter is the opposition to the armed seizure of power by the proletariat, attempting to erase armed struggle.

Erasing armed struggle and letting negotiations dominate everything is the consistent stance of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party. It was he who, after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, proposed the capitulationist line of the "peaceful democratic new stage," opposed revolutionary armed struggle, and dreamt of a "peaceful transition." It was he who, during the War of Liberation, through Peng Zhen and Gao Gang, fiercely attacked Comrade Lin Biao, who held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and insisted on Chairman Mao's correct line on the Northeast battlefield, claiming that Chairman Mao's strategic thought of "surrounding the cities from the countryside" was not applicable in the Northeast. He crazily promoted the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, which focused on defending large cities and transportation hubs, surrendering and accepting defectors, and forming factions, attempting to push the great War of Liberation onto the wrong path. It was he who, on the eve of the victory of the War of Liberation, was frightened by the roar of the cannons of the War of Liberation, shouting that "the revolutionary situation is developing too fast" and "it would be better to slow down," attempting to stop the wheels of history and halt the revolution. Anyone with eyes can see that General Jiang's path is the path of surrendering and accepting defectors; General Jiang's image is a miniature of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party. The directors, on the one hand, claim that the film is based on an important part of the Liaoning-Shenyang Campaign—the "peaceful liberation" of Changchun; on the other hand, they completely and thoroughly distort history. They do this obviously to steal the credit from heaven, attributing the victory of the War of Liberation to the victory of the bourgeois right-opportunist line represented by the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party, erecting monuments for the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party.

The people's mountains and rivers were won by the gun, and the people's mountains and rivers are protected by the gun. "Without an army of the people, there can be no people's everything." The biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party, however, hate and fear the gun. It was he who said that "even within the American reactionary clique, there are some people with clearer minds who gradually realize that the war policy may not be beneficial to the United States." The essence of this is to say that preparation for war has become unnecessary, and one can put away weapons and let horses graze. It was he who, in 1962, when reprinting the traitorous work "Cultivation" that betrays the dictatorship of the proletariat, carefully deleted an extremely important passage from the original version where Marx spoke to the workers: "You must undergo fifteen, twenty, fifty years of domestic and international war, not only to change the existing social relations but also to change yourselves and make yourselves into people capable of political rule." The essence of this is to say that the Marxist-Leninist theory of "revolutionary war omnipotence" has become outdated and is no longer needed to be learned. It was he who even when watching movies, "preferred light-hearted films" and "did not like war films," supposedly because they were "too stimulating and boring."

Comrade Lin Biao taught us: "The Marxist-Leninist theory of proletarian revolution, in the final analysis, is the theory of seizing power through revolutionary violence, the theory of people's war against anti-people's war." The biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party are so meticulous in trying to erase armed struggle, which precisely proves that they are great traitors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. "The Enemy at the Gate," under the banner of praising the War of Liberation, denies the important role of the gun, which precisely proves that its essence is to betray the proletarian revolution. The melody sung by the directors is the sound of the strings played by the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party. They regard armed struggle as a thorn in their eye because it is the strongest weapon to smash the old world; because it is the midwife of the birth of socialist society, the inevitable path to replace bourgeois dictatorship with proletarian dictatorship.

"In the frost of a thousand trees, red flowers bloom; the heavenly soldiers' anger surges to the heavens." In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party have been exposed by the proletarian revolutionaries. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Under the guidance of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, the broad proletarian revolutionaries are pressing on with their victories. In this great situation of "the golden monkey wields a thousand-catty cudgel, the jade firmament is cleansed of a myriad of dust," let us end this article with a passage from the "Communist Manifesto"!

"The Communists do not conceal their views and aims. They openly declare that their purpose can only be achieved by the forcible overthrow of all existing social conditions. Let the ruling classes tremble at the Communist revolution. The proletarians have nothing to lose but their chains. They have a world to win."

    否定“枪杆子”鼓吹“舌尖子”的大毒草《兵临城下》
    哈尔滨师范学院红色造反团文艺批判纵队
    解放战争的胜利，是靠枪杆子打出来的，还是靠舌尖子谈出来的？历史早就作了结论，正如毛主席所说：“中国革命的主要方法，中国革命的主要形式，不能是和平的，而必须是武装的”。
    但是，抗日战争胜利后，中国革命向何处去？这在党内是存在着两条路线的尖锐斗争的。毛主席英明地指出：枪杆子里面出政权”。蒋介石在磨刀了，我们也要磨刀。而党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却大唱反调，鼓吹“国内问题由政治方面来解决”，宣扬议会斗争的道路。针对这种论调，毛主席又一针见血地指出：美帝国主义和国民党反动派的本性是不能改变的。“以为靠着政治影响就可以解决问题。那是迷信。”“唯一的办法是组织力量和他们斗争，……把他们打倒”。解放战争的胜利，是毛主席的人民战争理论的胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。这不但是人民武装战胜了反革命武装所取得的胜利，而且是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线战胜了以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为代表的资产阶级右倾机会主义路线所取得的胜利。
    反动影片《兵临城下》既然以解放战争为背景，理应用“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题”这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则作为指导创作的最高指示，让观众通过艺术形象更加深刻地领会武装斗争的重要。可是，影片编导者却在这个“革命原则”的问题上大唱反调，把和平争取凌驾于武装斗争之上，从而取消了武装斗争。这就从根本上背离了“枪杆子里面出政权”这一马克思列宁主义的伟大真理，而为中国赫鲁晓夫的“国内问题由政治方面来解决”这一反革命修正主义的纲领作艺术图解，把解放战争的胜利记在以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为代表的资产阶级右倾机会主义路线的“功劳簿”上。
    《兵临城下》，顾名思义，应当表现在敌我双方的军事斗争中，我大兵压境，捉拿已成瓮中之鳖的敌人的形势。然而，影片竟偷梁换柱，把敌军内部的嫡庶派别之间狗咬狗的斗争写成主要矛盾，而把敌我军事上的斗争写成次要矛盾，并使我军处于极次要的地位。在影片中，逼使赵崇武起义的竟不是人民战争的强大军事、政治威力，而是蒋介石拍给胡高参的一封密电。正是这封密电带来了“物极必反”的效果，导致了某城的解放。这就完全否定了我军的军事攻势在解放某城中所起的具有决定性的主导作用，而把胜利的取得归之于赵崇武在敌军内部的派别之争中获得的“成功”。
    影片《兵临城下》完全抹煞了武装斗争的决定性的作用。在影片中，我军的军事行动只是无足轻重的点缀。相反，那喧闹的庆寿筵席，那欢乐的洗尘舞会，那镇定自若的谈笑，那神采飞扬的演说，却无一不在说明，敌军不是“瓮中之鳖”，而是“入海之龙”。这岂不是向人们显示：什么军事打击，什么枪杆子威力，都是毫无作用的；迫使敌人起义的不是“枪杆子”，而是“舌尖子”。
    在这种思想的指导下，一个“和平使者”便翩然而出——姜部长进城了。作为我军高级将领的姜部长是在赵崇武的态度不明、内外音讯断绝这个危难关头进城的，目的是想乞求赵崇武起义。他把该城的解放寄托在敌人的“清醒”和“明智”上，并想凭自己的三寸不烂之舌劝说赵崇武这个双手沾满共产党人和革命人民鲜血的刽子手“放下屠刀，立地成佛”。这是典型的右倾机会主义。正是这种政治上的右倾机会主义，导致了姜部长的那种行动上的左倾冒险主义。郑汉臣说他的进城是“太冒险”，他竟爽朗地笑笑，说什么“到郑团长家里作客，谁敢动我？”殊不知站在面前的郑汉臣就是自己的敌人。而郑汉臣居然不仅没“动”，反倒想方设法地加以保护。唯一的原因就是姜部长对他有“不杀之恩”和“送子之情”。这就把敌人写得既“明智”而又有“理性”，一切都如姜部长所估计的那样，敌人是能“放下屠刀，立地成佛”的。
    毛主席一再教导我们：反动派的本性是不能改变的，他们“决不肯放下屠刀，他们也决不能成佛，直至他们的灭亡。”“希望劝说帝国主义者和中国反动派发出善心，回头是岸，是不可能的。唯一的办法是组织力量和他们斗争”。解放战争的胜利，就是“枪杆子里面出政权”这一马克思列宁主义普遍真理的胜利。然而，影片名曰《兵临城下》，却只有“劝说”而无“兵”，并公然宣称敌人“只要放下屠刀，就能立地成佛”，而且果真“成”了“佛”。这就把中国人民用枪杆子夺取的胜利果实，算在“和平谈判”、“议会道路”这本修正主义的“功劳簿”上。这不但攻击了毛泽东思想，而且篡改了解放战争的历史。
    编导者在同名话剧的“后记”中说，《兵临城下》主要取材于长春的“和平解放”。
    难道长春的解放，真是“和平”的吗？不是。长春自一九四七年冬起，即被东北人民解放军包围。一九四八年十月十九日，在我军攻克锦州，东北敌军全部动摇的形势下，敌人才被迫不得不放下武器。毛主席曾对这一历史阶段的整个国内政治和军事形势的重大变化作过科学的论述。他在《中国人民解放军宣言》这个光辉的文献中指出：“中国人民解放军，在粉碎蒋介石的进攻之后，现已大举反攻。南线我军已向长江流域进击，北线我军已向中长、北宁两路进击。我军所到之处，敌人望风披靡，人民欢声雷动。整个敌我形势，和一年前比较，已经起了基本上的变化。”他又在《中国军事形势的重大变化》这篇天才的著作里指出：“中国的军事形势现已进入一个新的转折点，即战争双方力量对比已经发生了根本的变化。人民解放军不但在质量上早已占有优势，而且在数量上现在也已经占有优势。这是中国革命的成功和中国和平的实现已经迫近的标志。”《中国人民解放军宣言》，写于一九四七年十月，即我军包围长春的前夕；《中国军事形势的重大变化》，写于一九四八年十一月，即我军解放长春后的不久。这就是说，长春是在整个敌我形势已经起了“基本上的变化”这一历史条件下被我军包围的；是在战争双方力量对比发生了“根本的变化”这一历史条件下“和平解放”的。正是“锦州的解放，迫使长春的敌人一部起义，其余全部投降。”可见，要是没有我军强大的武装力量作后盾，要是没有我军勇猛的军事打击相威逼，便没有长春的“和平解放”。居第一位的绝不是“和平争取”，而是军事打击。长春如此，其他地方的解放也莫不如此。编导者却把和平争取凌驾于军事打击之上，甚至不惜歪曲历史，制造“先例”，这是百分之百的修正主义。其要害就是反对无产阶级武装夺取政权，妄想把武装斗争一笔勾销。
    取消武装斗争，让和谈去主宰一切，这正是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的一贯主张。就是他，在抗日战争胜利以后，提出“和平民主新阶段”的投降主义路线，反对革命的武装斗争，大做“和平过渡”的美梦。就是他，在解放战争时期，通过彭真和高岗，在东北战场上大肆攻击高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、坚持毛主席的正确路线的林彪同志，胡说毛主席的“农村包围城市”的战略思想在东北不适用，疯狂地推行以保卫大城市和交通要道，反对建立根据地，招降纳叛，结党营私为主要内容的资产阶级反动路线，妄图把伟大的解放战争推向邪道。就是他，在解放战争胜利前夕，被解放战争的隆隆炮声吓破了胆，叫嚷“现在革命形势发展太快”，“不如慢一点”，妄图阻止历史车轮前进，使革命就此止步。明眼人一看便知，姜部长的道路就是招降纳叛的道路；姜部长的形象就是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的缩影。编导者一面声称这部影片是取材于辽沈战役的一个重要组成部分——长春的“和平解放”；一面又完全彻底地篡改了历史。他们这样做，显然是想贪天之功，把解放战争的胜利说成是以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为代表的右倾机会主义路线的胜利，为党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派树碑立传。
    人民的江山靠枪杆子打，人民的江山靠枪杆子保。“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却对枪杆子恨得要死，怕得要命。就是他，胡说什么“就是在美国反动集团内部，也有一些头脑比较清醒的人，逐渐认识到战争政策对美国未必有利。”其实质就是说，备战已成为不必要，可以刀枪入库、马放南山了。就是他，在一九六二年重新出版背叛无产阶级专政的《修养》时，精心删去了原版中所引用的马克思跟工人说的一段极为重要的话：“你们应当经受十五年、二十年、五十年的国内战争与国际战争，不仅是为了改变现存的社会关系，而且是为了改变你们自己和使你们自己变成为能够进行政治统治的人材。”其实质就是说，马克思列宁主义的“革命战争万能”论已经过时，不需要再学它了。就是他，连平时看电影，都“愿看轻松的片子”，而“不喜欢看打仗片”，据说是因为“太刺激了，使人厌烦”。
    林彪同志教导我们说：“马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级革命的学说，归根到底，就是用革命暴力夺取政权的学说，用人民战争反对反人民战争的学说。”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，竟如此处心积虑地想取消武装斗争，这恰足以证明他是无产阶级革命事业的大叛徒。《兵临城下》打着歌颂解放战争的旗号，来否定枪杆子的重要作用，这恰恰证明它的要害就是背叛无产阶级革命。编导者所唱之曲，正是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所弹的弦上之音。他们之所以要把武装斗争看作眼中钉，就因为它是摧毁旧世界的最强大的武器；就因为它是社会主义社会诞生的产婆，是用无产阶级专政代替资产阶级专政的必由之路。
    “万木霜天红烂漫，天兵怒气冲霄汉。”在这史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，被无产阶级革命派揪出来了，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的指引下，广大的无产阶级革命派正在乘胜追击。在这“金猴奋起千钧棒，玉宇澄清万里埃”的大好形势里，让我们用《共产党宣言》里的一段话来结束本文吧！
    “共产党人不屑于隐瞒自己的观点和意图。他们公开宣布：他们的目的只有用暴力推翻全部现存的社会制度才能达到。让统治阶级在共产主义革命面前发抖吧。”
