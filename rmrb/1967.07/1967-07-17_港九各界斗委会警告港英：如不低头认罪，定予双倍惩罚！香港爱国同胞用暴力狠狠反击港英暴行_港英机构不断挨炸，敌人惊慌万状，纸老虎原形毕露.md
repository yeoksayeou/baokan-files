Hong Kong and Kowloon Patriotic Fellow Countrymen Vow to Give Double Punishment if British Authorities Do Not Repent

Hong Kong patriotic fellow countrymen retaliate with violence against the British authorities' atrocities

British institutions in Hong Kong are repeatedly bombed, the enemy is in a state of panic, the paper tiger's true colors are exposed

New China News Agency, Hong Kong, July 16

In response to the British fascist authorities' escalating atrocities against Hong Kong patriotic fellow countrymen, the patriotic fellow countrymen of Hong Kong have retaliated with violence against the evil British imperialists, greatly boosting their own fighting spirit and thoroughly crushing the enemy's arrogance.

In recent days, British police stations and British-controlled institutions in Hong Kong have been repeatedly bombed. British officials and police are like startled birds, trembling with fear and seeing danger in every shadow.

On the 9th and 13th, the Kwun Tong Police Station and the Wong Tai Sin Police Station were bombed, destroying at least six cars and one motorcycle.

In the afternoon of the 12th, the British-controlled "Tai Po Rural Committee," which is manipulated by American and Chiang Kai-shek elements, was bombed. Most of the chairs in the room and the storage room were destroyed. This organization has recently been actively planning to establish a so-called "Tai Po Civil Defense Corps" to sell their lives for the British fascist authorities' bloody suppression of our patriotic fellow countrymen, which has deeply enraged the patriotic villagers of Tai Po.

Under the brave retaliation of Hong Kong patriotic fellow countrymen, British police are in a state of panic and disarray. The Eastern and Western Districts Police Stations in Hong Kong, and the Wong Tai Sin Police Station in Kowloon's Sham Shui Po and Yau Ma Tei areas are now heavily fortified with barricades. Many police stations have sandbags piled up at their entrances, and some even have iron barricades set up on the streets in front, layer upon layer of defenses. On the night of the 13th, when the Yau Ma Tei Police Station was bombed, a group of British police officers inside fled in panic, some wearing only their underpants, some crouching like turtles, trembling and shaking, some too frightened to even draw their pistols, revealing their true colors as paper tigers. On the afternoon of the 13th, a briefcase was found in an elevator in a building in Mong Kok. The British authorities, treating it as a major threat, immediately dispatched a large number of police to surround the building. Military experts carefully removed the briefcase, only to find that it belonged to a lawyer and was not a "bomb." The patriotic fellow countrymen of Hong Kong have retaliated with violence against the British authorities' brutal suppression, causing the British authorities to be in a state of panic, greatly boosting the fighting spirit of Hong Kong patriotic fellow countrymen against the British and thoroughly crushing the arrogance of British imperialism.

New China News Agency, Hong Kong, July 16

The Committee of Hong Kong and Kowloon Fellow Countrymen Opposing British Atrocities issued a statement on the 15th, warning the British authorities about their recent series of fascist atrocities.

The statement said: The British authorities recently brazenly deployed a large number of British troops and "riot squads" to launch night raids on the Kowloon Dockyard Workers' Union, Red Ferry Labor Children's School, and Fukien Middle School; shot and killed a dockyard worker; arrested all teacher representatives who went to the British "Governor's House" to protest; unlawfully abducted New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch reporters and patriotic newspaper reporters who were on the scene at the "Governor's House"; and illegally detained patriotic film workers Fu Qi and Shi Hui. All these incidents occurred after the British authorities announced a comprehensive escalation of suppression against our patriotic fellow countrymen in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Obviously, this is a serious provocation by the evil British authorities, which has been premeditated. We strongly protest against the British fascist authorities.

The statement pointed out: The British fascist authorities have been beaten to a standstill by our patriotic fellow countrymen in the past two months and are completely on the defensive. They are now making a desperate counterattack, hoping to use further escalated suppression to deter our patriotic fellow countrymen's fierce retaliation. This fully exposes their paper tiger nature. The statement said: "Since the British authorities are so reckless in deploying troops to suppress our patriotic fellow countrymen, carrying out large-scale arrests, then we have even more reason to take the initiative, to arm ourselves, to seize various weapons that can be used in battle, or to seize the enemy's weapons, to give these savage beasts a fierce retaliation, to give them double punishment."

The statement emphasized: "We seriously warn the British fascist authorities: Do not think that by taking military suppression actions you can destroy our patriotic organizations one by one and annihilate our patriotic fellow countrymen. This is sheer delusion. Be careful of your own heads, if you do not know when to retreat and admit your crimes, then we know how to deal with you."

    港九各界斗委会警告港英：如不低头认罪，定予双倍惩罚！
    香港爱国同胞用暴力狠狠反击港英暴行
    港英机构不断挨炸，敌人惊慌万状，纸老虎原形毕露
    新华社香港十六日电  针对港英法西斯当局疯狂迫害香港爱国同胞的暴行升级，香港爱国同胞以英帝国主义之道，还治其身，狠狠地反击万恶的英帝国主义，大长自己的斗志，大灭敌人的威风。
    连日来，港英警署和港英御用机构不断挨炸，港英官员、警察如惊弓之鸟，心惊胆战，草木皆兵。
    九日和十三日，观塘警署和黄大仙警署先后发生爆炸，至少有六辆汽车和一辆摩托车被炸毁。
    十二日下午五时多，港英御用的、由美蒋分子控制的“大埔乡事会”发生爆炸，室内坐椅和贮物室大部分被炸毁。这个组织最近积极策划成立所谓
  “大埔民安自卫队”，妄图为港英法西斯当局血腥镇压我爱国同胞卖命，大埔爱国乡民恨之入骨。
    在香港爱国同胞的英勇反击下，港英警察惊慌失措，狼狈不堪。香港东区、西区警署，九龙深水埗、油麻地区黄大仙警署现在都大门深锁，并加筑防御工事。许多警署门外堆满沙包，有些甚至在前面街道架设铁马等物，把警署层层包住。油麻地警署十三日晚挨炸的时候，里面一群英国警官和警察象惊弓之鸟一样，争相夺门而逃，有些只穿了一条裤衩，有些象乌龟一样，缩头弯腰，手颤脚震，有些吓得连腰间的手枪也掏不出来，丑态百出，纸老虎原形毕露。十三日下午，旺角一间大厦的电梯内发现一个公文包，港英当局如临大敌，赶忙出动大批警察包围大厦，由军火专家小心翼翼地将公文包取出，检查后才发现原来是一个律师遗下的，而不是什么“炸弹”。香港爱国同胞以暴力反击港英的疯狂镇压，使港英当局惊慌万状，大长香港爱国同胞反英抗暴的斗志，大灭港英帝国主义的威风。
    新华社香港十六日电  港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会十五日发表声明，就港英当局最近制造一连串的法西斯暴行，向港英当局提出严重警告。
    声明说：港英当局最近悍然出动大批英国陆军和“防暴队”，接连夜袭九龙船坞劳工联合会、红磡劳工子弟学校和福建中学；开枪杀死一名船坞工人；逮捕前往港英“总督府”抗议的全部教师代表；无理绑架在“总督府”现场采访的新华社香港分社记者和爱国报纸记者；非法拘捕爱国电影工作者傅奇和石慧。这一切事件，都是在港英当局宣布对我港九爱国同胞实行全面扩大镇压以后连续炮制出来的。显然这是万恶的港英当局早有预谋地对我爱国同胞的极其严重的挑衅。我们向港英法西斯当局提出最严重、最强烈的抗议。
    声明指出：港英法西斯当局这两个多月来被我爱国同胞打得晕头转向，完全陷于被动。于是再度作垂死的反扑，指望用进一步升级镇压来吓阻我爱国同胞的猛烈反击。这充分暴露了它的纸老虎本质。声明说：“既然港英如此不计后果地出动军队，对我爱国同胞实行军事镇压，实行大肆逮捕，那么，我们就更加取得主动，更加有权武装起来，拿起各种可以作战的武器，或夺取敌人的武器，给这些残暴凶狠的野兽以狠狠的反击，予以双倍的惩罚。”
    声明强调说：“我们严重警告港英法西斯当局：你们不要以为采取军事镇压行动就可以把我们的爱国机构逐个击破，把我爱国同胞赶尽杀绝了，这完全是痴心妄想。还是当心你们自己的脑袋吧，如不知难而退，低头认罪，那么，我们是懂得如何来收拾你们的。”
