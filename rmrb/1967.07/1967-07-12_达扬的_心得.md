The "one-eyed general" Dayan, who commanded the Israeli invasion forces to launch a surprise attack on Arab countries, has become a favorite of American and British imperialism due to his aggressive successes. American and British bourgeois newspapers have widely published interviews with Dayan, praising him as the "hero of the Sinai Peninsula," the "master of mechanized warfare," and so on. In short, he seems to be a remarkable figure.

This Jewish Zionist, over fifty years old, is a hound raised by American and British imperialism. He lost his left eye while serving in the British army. After Israel was created, Dayan became a key figure in both the military and political spheres of Israel. During the 1956 invasion of Egypt by Britain, France, and Israel, he led the Israeli invasion forces and was a butcher with the blood of the Arab people on his hands. Later, he became the Minister of Agriculture in Israel. However, in reality, Dayan's mind was not on the fields of Israel but on the territories of Arab countries. He was waiting for the day to wield his butcher's knife again.

Last August, Dayan appeared in South Vietnam as a "war correspondent." Was this man suddenly interested in journalism? Obviously not. According to American newspapers, Dayan stayed in South Vietnam for several weeks, always with the American invasion forces' commanders. He was praised as "a diligent student of American strategy." It is clear that Dayan was sent by American imperialism to participate in actual combat training. From this, one can see how much effort American imperialism has put into plotting Israel's armed attack on Arab countries. Dayan's appointment as Minister of Defense and Commander-in-Chief before Israel's surprise attack was obviously arranged by American imperialism and the Israeli reactionaries. His activities in South Vietnam ten months ago are a powerful piece of evidence that American imperialism had conspired to direct Israel to invade Arab countries.

Interestingly, after Dayan's surprise attack on Arab countries succeeded, his teachers turned to him for advice. In a U.S. radio program, Dayan was asked whether a "blitzkrieg" in South Vietnam had a chance of winning. Dayan's response, however, was disheartening to his American masters. He admitted that the so-called "blitzkrieg tactics" would not work in the American war in Vietnam. Why not? He said: "This is because the people of South Vietnam are waging guerrilla warfare, and the United States cannot counter guerrilla warfare with technology or increased troops."

Dayan's response essentially acknowledges, albeit reluctantly, that people's war is something that American imperialism and its lackeys cannot handle. It is a powerful weapon for oppressed nations to defeat American imperialism and its lackeys. Since the heroic people of South Vietnam have, through people's war, beaten the American invaders to a pulp, leaving them exhausted and frantic, then if the Arab people also rise up to wage people's war against the invaders, wouldn't Dayan and his American imperialist masters also be beaten to a pulp, no matter what strategy they adopt?

    达扬的“心得”
    左军
    指挥以色列侵略军向阿拉伯国家发动突然袭击的“独眼将军”达扬，由于侵略有功，一下子成了美、英帝国主义的宠儿。美英资产阶级报刊大登达扬的访问记，把他吹捧为“西奈半岛的英雄”、“机械化战争的能手”……总之，似乎是个了不起的人物。
    这个年逾半百的犹太复国主义者，是美英帝国主义一手培养起来的一条猎犬。他的左眼就是在英国军队服役时丢掉的。以色列被制造出来以后，达扬成了以色列军政两界的要人。在一九五六年英、法、以对阿联发动侵略的时候，他就充当了以色列侵略军的头目，是一个双手沾满了阿拉伯人民鲜血的刽子手。以后，他当了以色列的农业部长。但是，实际上达扬的心思并没有放在以色列的农田上，而是放在阿拉伯国家的领土上。他是在等待着有朝一日，再挥舞他的屠刀。
    去年八月间，达扬以“战地记者”的名义出现在南越的美国军队中。难道是这个家伙忽然对新闻写作发生了兴趣吗？显然不是的。据美国报刊透露，达扬在南越呆了好几个星期，一直同美国侵略军的指挥官在一起。他被称赞为“一个专心学习美国战略的好学生”。事情很清楚，达扬是被美帝国主义弄去参加实战见习的。人们由此可以看出，美帝国主义为了策划这一次以色列对阿拉伯国家的武装进攻，花了多大的心血。达扬在以色列发动突然袭击前夕出任国防部长和总司令，显然是美帝国主义和以色列反动派早有安排的。十个月前他在南越的活动，不正是美帝国主义蓄谋指使以色列侵略阿拉伯国家的一个有力的旁证吗？
    有意思的是，在达扬对阿拉伯国家发动突然袭击得手以后，他的老师却反过来向他求教。在一次美国广播节目中，达扬被问到这样的问题：在南越实行“闪电战”是否有获胜的希望？达扬的回答却是使他的美国主子泄气的，他承认所谓“闪电战术”在美国侵越战争中行不通。为什么行不通呢？他说：这是因为南越人民进行了游击战争，“美国是无法靠技术或者增兵来对付游击战的”。
    达扬的回答，实际上是无可奈何地承认，人民战争是美帝国主义及其走狗所无法对付的，它是被压迫民族战胜美帝国主义及其走狗的有效法宝。既然英雄的越南南方人民依靠人民战争把美国侵略者打得头破血流，疲于奔命；那末，只要阿拉伯人民也奋起对侵略者进行人民战争，不管达扬及其主子美帝国主义采取什么样的战略，不是也一样可以把他们打得头破血流吗？
