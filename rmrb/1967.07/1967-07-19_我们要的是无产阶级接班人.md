In the current high tide of the great criticism of the revolution, revolutionary workers from Tianjin held a symposium. They angrily exposed and criticized the crimes of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, who used Tianjin as a test point to promote the revisionist "two labor systems, two educational systems." This was done to split and destroy the ranks of the working class, cultivate bourgeois successors, and restore capitalism. Below are the records of some workers' speeches at the symposium.

Worker Li Hanqing from the Electronic Instruments Factory said: Chairman Mao pointed out, "Our educational policy is to develop the all-around development of the educated in terms of ideology, intelligence, and physical education, to become a socialist-conscious and cultured laborer." However, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party sang a different tune. His "half-work, half-study" system is to cultivate bourgeois successors. Our factory's "half-work, half-study" school was set up according to his "instructions." The Khrushchev of China advocated using the "volunteer army" method to establish a "half-work, half-study" teaching staff. In our factory's "half-work, half-study" school, capitalists, rightists, and ghosts and monsters became "teachers," using the legal podium to spread poison every day. They, along with a handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, share the same breath, saying things like, "Studying Chairman Mao's works is not as good as solving a few problems." They also maliciously use the banner of "lecturing on stage, helping off stage, master teaching apprentice, combining classroom and outside classroom" to let a capitalist lead seven or eight apprentices. Can a capitalist "master" bring up proletarian apprentices?

Workers Li Runchang and Liu Jianchang from the Chunhe Wireless Factory said: Our factory's "half-work, half-study" school teaches the "suffer a small loss, gain a big advantage" philosophy of the Khrushchev of China. Workers have to have their wages deducted when they go to school. They also say, "Don't look at the present, look at the long term. After graduation, you can become an engineer, technician, or expert, and earn more money." They make the youth draw up "red and expert" plans, becoming a "master" or "expert" in a few years. Some people have been poisoned and struggle all day to become "famous" and "expert," focusing only on their skills and not participating in political activities.

Female worker Chi Yulan from the Photographic Film Factory said: I hate the "half-work, half-study" school that the Khrushchev of China set up in our factory. The Khrushchev of China said, "'Half-work, half-study' itself is a class struggle," and "as long as teachers and students participate in production labor, their ideological appearance will change." He opposed political leadership, advocated the idea of fame and profit, and promoted material incentives. Therefore, our factory's "half-work, half-study" school became a big dye vat of bourgeois ideology. Dancing was rampant in the school. At that time, I originally did not know how to dance and did not want to, but over time, I was influenced and learned to dance. I also felt that my clothes were not good enough and often argued with my family. My father said I was no longer like a worker's child. This is all because of the poison of the revisionist "half-work, half-study"! We have not made any progress in technology, and we are even further behind in political ideology. The school leadership did not mention studying Chairman Mao's works at all but said, "Study hard, work hard, respect others and be strict with oneself, and strive for the peak." Can such a school cultivate successors of the proletarian class who are all-around developed with socialist consciousness? Absolutely not! The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party used "half-work, half-study" to poison young workers, and this crime must be settled!

Old worker Shen Junbao from the Electronic Instruments Factory said: The "two labor systems, two educational systems" advocated by the Khrushchev of China are completely cast from the mold of capitalist educational systems. His purpose is to cultivate successors for the bourgeoisie. The handful of capitalist-roaders in our factory set up the "half-work, half-study" school according to the "imperial edict" of the Khrushchev of China. This school was praised as a "red flag" unit by the Khrushchev of China, and those it cultivated were detached from the real class struggle, single-mindedly pursuing fame and expertise.

Old worker Xing Peigao from the Electronic Instruments Factory said: We, the working class, want our own successors, the kind of "socialist-conscious and cultured laborers" that Chairman Mao talked about, successors who are "completely" and "thoroughly" "serving the people"; not the kind cultivated by the methods of the Khrushchev of China. If such people take over, we, the working class, will not be at ease for a thousand years. We must hand over the reins to the proletarian successors nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought. Now, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party has been exposed. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize him and his revisionist educational line, and consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat.

    我们要的是无产阶级接班人
    在目前革命的大批判的高潮中，天津市广大革命工人举行座谈会，愤怒地揭发和批判了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派以天津为试点，推行修正主义的“两种劳动制度、两种教育制度”，分化瓦解和破坏工人阶级队伍，培养资产阶级接班人，复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。下面是部分工厂的工人，在座谈会上发言的记录。
    电子仪器厂工人李汉青说：毛主席指出：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却大唱对台戏。他搞的那套“半工半读”，是培养资产阶级的接班人。我们厂的“半工半读”学校，就是按照他的“指示”办起来的。中国的赫鲁晓夫鼓吹采用“志愿军”的办法来建立半工半读的教师队伍。在我们厂的“半工半读”学校，资本家、右派分子、牛鬼蛇神当了“老师”，利用合法的讲台天天放毒。他们和党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派一个鼻孔冒臭气，胡说什么“学习毛主席著作不如解几道题”。他们还恶毒地打着“台上讲，台下帮，师傅带徒弟，课堂内外相结合”的幌子，让一个资本家带七、八个徒弟。资本家“师傅”能带出无产阶级的徒弟吗？
    春和无线电厂工人李润昌、刘建昌说：我
  厂的“半工半读”学校，传的是中国的赫鲁晓夫“吃小亏，占大便宜”的经。工人上学还要扣工资。他们还说什么：“不要看眼前，要向长远看，将来毕了业，当上工程师、技师、专家，钱就挣多了”。他们叫青年制定什么“红专”规划，几年成什么“师”，什么“家”。有些人中了毒，整天为成“名”成“家”奋斗，光啃业务，不参加政治活动。
    感光胶片厂女工池玉兰说：对中国的赫鲁晓夫在我们厂办的“半工半读”学校，我恨得牙根疼。中国的赫鲁晓夫胡说什么“半工半读本身就是阶级斗争”，“只要让教师、学生参加生产劳动，他们的思想面貌就会起变化”。他反对政治挂帅，宣扬名利思想，大搞物质刺激。因此，我们厂办的“半工半读”学校成了一个资产阶级思想的大染缸。学校里跳舞泛滥成灾。当时，我本来不会也不愿跳舞，天长日久受熏染，思想感情慢慢起了变化，也学会跳舞了。我还觉得自己穿得不好，常和家里闹别扭。父亲说我不象工人的子女了。这都是中了修正主义的“半工半读”的毒！我们在技术上没有什么进步，在政治思想上更跟不上了。学校领导上根本不提学习毛主席著作，却说什么：“学习猛钻，劳动猛干，尊人严己，攀登高峰”。这样的学校，能培养出德智体全面发展的、有社会主义觉悟的无产阶级接班人吗？根本不能！党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，利用“半工半读”来毒害青年工人，真是罪该万死。这笔账我们一定要清算！
    电子仪器厂老工人沈俊宝说：中国的赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的“两种劳动制度、两种教育制度”，完全是从资本主义教育制度的模子里铸出来的货色。他的目的就是要给资产阶级培养接班人。我们厂的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就是按中国的赫鲁晓夫的“圣旨”办“半工半读”学校的。这个学校是被中国的赫鲁晓夫树为“红旗”的单位，培养出来的就有人脱离现实的阶级斗争，一心一意想成“名”成“家”。
    电子仪器厂老工人邢沛高说：我们工人阶级要的是我们自己的接班人，是毛主席他老人家所说的那种“有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”，是“完全”“彻底”地“为人民服务”的接班人；而不是按照中国的赫鲁晓夫那套办法培养出来的那种人。这种人接班，我们工人阶级是一千个不放心的。我们一定要把班交给用毛泽东思想抚育出来的无产阶级后代。现在，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派被揪出来了。我们要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把他连同他的修正主义教育路线批深批透，巩固和加强无产阶级专政。
