In the current international anti-China hysteria stirred up by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, the fascist military regime in Indonesia, represented by Suharto and Nasution, is plotting a new large-scale conspiracy to persecute Indonesian patriotic overseas Chinese. All indications show that the Indonesian reactionaries are about to strike at the Indonesian overseas Chinese again. The Chinese people and the Indonesian overseas Chinese are closely watching the movements of the Indonesian reactionaries.

Recently, the leaders of the Indonesian right-wing military clique, Suharto, have repeatedly publicly slandered China for allegedly using overseas Chinese to "subvert and infiltrate" Indonesia, and have threatened to "completely solve" the overseas Chinese problem. Suharto's so-called "complete solution" is a serious signal that the Indonesian reactionaries are about to carry out comprehensive persecution of overseas Chinese.

It has been seen that the Indonesian reactionaries have been intensifying their plotting of this new anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese conspiracy. The Indonesian reactionary government issued a directive, the 37th "Instruction," titled "Basic Measures for Solving the Chinese Problem," which irrationally stipulates that no more residence, employment, and business permits will be issued to overseas Chinese, and that overseas Chinese can be subjected to "legal measures," "exile," or even "expulsion" on the pretext of "crimes" or "subversive activities" in "political, economic, or socio-cultural" areas. The Indonesian Immigration Bureau also issued a directive prohibiting overseas Chinese who have left Indonesia from returning. The so-called "Cooperative Parliament" of Indonesia also proposed a draft law to "restrict the economic activities of overseas Chinese." The Indonesian fascist military regime also held a national military district commanders' conference in Jakarta to plan the specific steps for anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese actions.

What is particularly noteworthy is that the Indonesian right-wing military clique is openly colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek gang, using Chiang's followers to persecute overseas Chinese. The Chiang Kai-shek gang has sent its head of so-called "overseas affairs" to Indonesia to "assist" the Indonesian reactionary government in "solving the overseas Chinese problem." With the assistance of the Chiang Kai-shek gang, the Indonesian reactionary government has established so-called "liaison organizations" across the country, using Chiang's followers to carry out so-called "screening" activities against overseas Chinese, dividing patriotic overseas Chinese, and compiling blacklists to prepare for the mass arrest of leaders of patriotic overseas Chinese.

The patriotic overseas Chinese in Indonesia have been fighting bravely and tenaciously against the persecution of the Indonesian reactionaries, demonstrating the great heroic spirit of the Chinese nation. The Indonesian patriotic overseas Chinese, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are invincible against any reactionary forces. Facing the new conspiracy of the Indonesian reactionaries to persecute overseas Chinese, the Indonesian patriotic overseas Chinese need to further heighten their vigilance, make preparations, and be ready to face the new and complex struggles that are about to come.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In human history, any reactionary force that is about to perish will always make a final struggle against the revolutionary forces." The new conspiracy of the Indonesian right-wing military clique to further persecute patriotic overseas Chinese is a sign of the serious crisis in their reactionary rule. Since the right-wing military clique came to power, class struggle in Indonesia has become extremely sharp, and the economic situation is on the verge of collapse. Coupled with the numerous internal contradictions within the reactionary camp, the crisis of the fascist military regime's rule has deepened. The Indonesian reactionaries are in a state of extreme chaos and panic. The Suharto-Nasution clique can only survive by killing and suppressing the people. While they are madly engaging in anti-Communist, anti-Chinese, and anti-people activities, they will inevitably carry out new and brutal suppression against the revolutionary people of Indonesia. The Indonesian fascist military regime mistakenly believes that it can save itself from doom by engaging in bloody anti-Communist, anti-Chinese, and anti-people activities. But this is completely futile, and on the contrary, it will only accelerate their own doom.

We must solemnly warn the Indonesian reactionary government: blood debts must be repaid in blood. Your mad anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese actions will surely be severely punished by history!

    必须粉碎印尼反动派反华排华的新阴谋
    本报评论员
    在目前美帝苏修煽起的一股国际反华的妖风中，美帝国主义的走狗以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为代表的印尼法西斯军人政权，正在精心策划着一个大规模迫害印尼爱国华侨的新阴谋。一切迹象显示，印尼反动派又要对印尼华侨狠下毒手了。中国人民和印尼华侨正严密注意印尼反动派的这一动向。
    最近，印尼右派军人集团头子苏哈托一再公开诬蔑中国利用华侨对印尼进行所谓“颠覆和渗透”，并且叫嚷要“全面解决”华侨问题。苏哈托的所谓“全面解决”，就是印尼反动派即将对华侨实行全面迫害的一个严重的信号。
    人们已经看到，印尼反动派早就在加紧策划这个新的反华排华阴谋。印尼反动政府发表了一个名为“解决华人问题基本措施”的反华排华的第三十七号“训令”，其中无理规定不再为华侨发出“居住、就业和营业的许可证”，并且可以借口所谓在“政治、经济或社会文化方面”进行“犯法、颠覆”活动，对华侨采取“刑法措施”、“放逐”甚至“驱逐”出境等等。印尼移民总局还发出指示，禁止离开印尼的华侨返回印尼。印尼的所谓“合作国会”还提出了一个“限制华侨经济活动”的法令草案。印尼法西斯军人政权还在雅加达召开了全国军区司令会议，策划反华排华的具体步骤。
    尤其值得注意的是：印尼右派军人集团公然同蒋介石匪帮大肆勾结，利用蒋帮分子迫害华侨。蒋介石匪帮已经派了它掌管所谓“侨务工作”的头目前往印尼，“帮助”印尼反动政府“解决华侨问题”。在蒋介石匪帮协助下，印尼反动政府在全国各地已经成立了所谓“联络机构”，利用蒋帮分子对华侨进行所谓“甄别”活动，分化爱国华侨，同时编造黑名单，准备大肆逮捕爱国华侨的领导人。
    印尼爱国华侨对于印尼反动派的迫害，一直进行了英勇顽强的斗争，表现了中华民族的大无畏英雄气概。用毛泽东思想武装起来的印尼爱国华侨，是任何反动势力所压不倒的。面对印尼反动派疯狂迫害华侨的新阴谋，印尼爱国华侨需要进一步提高警惕，作好准备，随时迎接即将到来的新的复杂的斗争。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。印尼右派军人集团进一步迫害爱国华侨的新阴谋，正是它的反动统治发生严重危机的一种标志。右派军人集团上台以后，印尼阶级斗争空前尖锐化，经济情况处于崩溃边缘。加上反动营垒内部矛盾重重，更加深了法西斯军人政权的统治危机。印尼反动派处于惶惶不可终日、极其混乱的局面中。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安集团只能靠屠杀和镇压人民过日子，它在疯狂反华排华的同时，必然要对印尼的革命人民实行新的残暴的镇压。印尼法西斯军人政权妄想用反共反华反人民的血腥勾当来挽救自己灭亡的命运。但这不仅是完全徒劳的，而且正相反，它们这样做，只能进一步加速自己的灭亡。
    我们要严正警告印尼反动政府，血债是要用血来偿还的。你们疯狂反华排华，必将受到历史的严厉的惩罚！
