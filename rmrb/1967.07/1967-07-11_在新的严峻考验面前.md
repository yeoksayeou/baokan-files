After the proletarian revolutionary factions achieved basic victory in the struggle for power, the most central issue they still face is the issue of political power, the issue of consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat. The proletarian revolutionary factions that have seized power now face the question of which path to take and where to go. This is a major issue concerning the nature of political power and a major issue concerning whether the fruits of the struggle for power can be consolidated and developed.

With the victory of the seizure of power, the bourgeoisie and their representatives, while openly opposing us and attempting to seize power back, are also using every means to corrupt and infiltrate the proletarian revolutionary factions, especially the leadership cores of the "three-in-one combination" power organs at various levels, in an attempt to achieve "peaceful evolution." The proletarian revolutionary factions must remain highly vigilant against this new form of class struggle and the bourgeoisie's attacks in the new situation.

It is known that new ideas can use old forms. But many of us are not sufficiently aware that old ideas can also use new forms. Bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas are extremely stubborn. Our struggle against them will never be a one-time effort. Old ideas often infiltrate new things in disguise, gradually eroding people's minds, changing the color of new things, and paving the way for the restoration of the old system. This situation must be given serious attention.

After seizing power, can the proletarian revolutionary factions persistently arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, continually overcome non-proletarian ideas in their minds, and resist the infiltration of various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas? This is a new and severe test.

Through a year of victorious struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, in many places and units, the proletarian revolutionary factions have gradually developed from political superiority to organizational superiority, achieving or striving to achieve the broadest revolutionary unity with the leftists as the core. Our revolutionary ranks have expanded, which is a great thing. However, people often bring their bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas into the ranks. This situation, combined with the serious existence of the ideology of the exploiting classes in society, determines that the confrontation and struggle between the two worldviews within the ranks of the proletarian revolutionaries are inevitable and will occur frequently.

After seizing power, the proletarian revolutionary factions should "wholeheartedly serve the people and never leave the masses," being both "officials" and "common people." However, some comrades have not done this. After becoming committee members or representatives, they gradually begin to distance themselves from the masses, from labor, and from actual struggles. They no longer study Chairman Mao's works seriously or emphasize politics. They do not understand the thoughts of the masses or conduct in-depth investigations. If they continue down this path, they will gradually weaken and lose their revolutionary nature and representativeness.

After seizing power, the proletarian revolutionary factions should continue to maintain a humble, prudent, unarrogant, and unhurried attitude. If they have shortcomings or mistakes, they should conduct serious self-criticism and humbly accept the criticism of the masses. However, some comrades have not done this. They enjoy being flattered, hearing sweet words, and listening to praise, finding it very comfortable. But they cannot accept criticism from the masses, and there is even a danger of suppressing democracy and different opinions, creating a situation of one-person rule.

After seizing power, the proletarian revolutionary factions should resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great directive to "be thrifty and make revolution," continuing to uphold and carry forward the glorious tradition of hard struggle. However, some comrades have not done this. They have begun to indulge in extravagance and waste, flaunt wealth, show off, seek fame, and display their status with a bourgeois "young master" attitude. They do not understand that being thrifty and making revolution is not just an economic issue but a political one, related to the nature of our political power.

Those with serious bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas, if they do not hold power, can be ignored, and their influence is small. But if they hold power, they can act according to their own ways, not according to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

If one's position changes but bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas do not change, or if they are allowed to develop, there is a possibility of repeating mistakes in direction and line.

Our great helmsman Chairman Mao recently taught us: "We must be good at guiding the small-bourgeois ideas in our ranks to the path of proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution." If we guide well, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will definitely be victorious; if we do not guide or guide poorly, a handful of class enemies will guide, using the vacillation of the petty bourgeoisie to prepare conditions for capitalist restoration. We must use Mao Zedong Thought, the Party's correct policies, and our model work to guide the masses forward. Every revolutionary cadre and leader of revolutionary mass organizations should be fully aware of this issue.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the bourgeoisie's ideological strongholds have been greatly weakened, and the authority of Mao Zedong Thought has been established. A year of struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party has educated hundreds of millions of people, helping them grasp Mao Zedong Thought. This provides the most favorable conditions for criticizing bourgeois ideas and overcoming the vacillation of the petty bourgeoisie. As long as we pay high attention to this struggle and skillfully guide it, the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas within the revolutionary ranks can be overcome in the process of learning and mastering Mao Zedong Thought, in the struggle against class enemies, in uniting with the workers and peasants, and in seizing the "power" of the "self" in one's mind.

The hundreds of millions of people armed with great Mao Zedong Thought, using the method of great democracy, supervising various levels of leadership from the bottom up, is our most reliable guarantee to resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideas and prevent revisionism.

History's judgment is merciless. The wheels of revolution roll forward.

We firmly believe that the revolutionary pioneers who have fought their way through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and achieved merits will be able to listen to Chairman Mao's words, continually transform their thoughts, and forever be the servants of the people, sharing weal and woe with the masses. Our comrades in the proletarian revolutionary factions will definitely be able to withstand the new and severe tests after seizing power.

    在新的严峻考验面前
    任立新
    无产阶级革命派在夺权斗争取得基本胜利以后，面临的最中心问题仍然是政权问题，巩固和加强无产阶级专政的问题。已经掌权的无产阶级革命派，走什么样的道路，向何处去，这是一个关系到政权性质的大问题，是关系到夺权斗争的胜利果实，能不能巩固、能不能发展的大问题。
    随着夺权的胜利，资产阶级及其代表人物，在采取公开对抗的方式，向我们进行反夺权的同时，还千方百计地对无产阶级革命派，特别是对各级“三结合”权力机构的领导核心，进行腐蚀侵袭，搞“和平演变”。对于阶级斗争的这种新形式，对于资产阶级在新形势下的进攻，无产阶级革命派必须保持高度的警惕。
    新思想可以利用旧形式，这是大家知道的。但对于旧思想也会利用新形式，我们许多人却认识不足。资产阶级和小资产阶级思想，是非常顽固的。我们同它们的斗争，决不可能一劳永逸。旧思想往往会改头换面地渗入新事物之中，逐渐地侵蚀人们的头脑，改变新事物的颜色，为旧制度的复辟开辟道路。这种情况，必须引起我们严重的注意。
    无产阶级革命派在掌权以后，能不能坚持不懈地用毛泽东思想来武装自己，不断地克服自己头脑中的非无产阶级思想，抵制形形色色的资产阶级和小资产阶级思想的侵袭，这是一个新的严峻的考验。
    经过一年来无产阶级文化大革命的胜利斗争，在许多地方和单位，无产阶级革命派逐渐由政治上的优势发展到组织上的优势，实现了或者正在实现以左派为核心的最广泛的革命大联合。我们的革命队伍更加扩大了，这是一件大好事。但同时，人们也往往会把自己的资产阶级和小资产阶级思想带进来。这种情况，加上社会上剥削阶级意识形态的严重存在，这就决定了：在无产阶级革命队伍里，两种世界观的对立和斗争，是不可避免的，是经常发生的。
    无产阶级革命派掌权以后，应当“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”，“既当‘官’，又当老百姓。”但是，有的同志却没有这样做。他们当了委员、代表以后，逐渐开始脱离群众，脱离劳动，脱离实际斗争。他们不是象过去那样，认真地学习毛主席著作，重视突出政治。他们不了解群众的思想，不深入调查研究。这样下去，他们就会渐渐减弱和丧失自己的革命性和代表性。
    无产阶级革命派掌权以后，要继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风。有了缺点错误，要进行认真的自我批评，虚心听取群众的批评。但是，有的同志却没有这样做。他们喜欢人家捧场，口吃蜜糖，耳听颂歌，还觉得很舒服。而对来自群众的批评，却听不进去，甚至有压制民主，压制不同意见，搞一言堂的危险。
    无产阶级革命派掌权以后，应当坚决执行毛主席的“要节约闹革命”的伟大指示，继续地保持和发扬艰苦奋斗的光荣传统。但是，有的同志却没有这样做。他们开始沾染了铺张浪费，讲阔气，摆排场，扬名声，显地位的资产阶级大少爷作风。他们不懂得，节约闹革命，不仅是一个经济问题，更重要的是一个政治问题，是关系到我们政权性质的问题。
    资产阶级和小资产阶级思想严重的人，不当权，人家可以不听他的，影响也就小。当了权，就不同了，就有可能按他们的一套办事，而不是按照毛主席的无产阶级革命路线办事。
    地位改变了，资产阶级和小资产阶级思想不改变，甚至听任其发展，就有可能重犯方向、路线的错误。　　　　　　　
    我们伟大的舵手毛主席最近教导我们：“必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。”引导得好，无产阶级文化大革命就一定胜利；如果我们不去引导，或者引导得不好，一小撮阶级敌人就会去引导，利用小资产阶级的摇摆性，为资本主义复辟准备条件。我们必须用毛泽东思想，用党的正确政策和自己的模范工作去引导群众前进。每一个革命干部，革命群众组织的负责人，对这个问题都应该有充分的自觉。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想，资产阶级和小资产阶级思想的地盘大大缩小了。一年来向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗争的实践，教育了亿万群众，使他们进一步掌握了毛泽东思想，树立了毛泽东思想的绝对权威。这就为批判资产阶级思想，克服小资产阶级的摇摆性，提供了最有利的条件。只要我们高度重视这个斗争，善于因势利导，革命队伍中的资产阶级和小资产阶级思想，是完全可以在学习和掌握毛泽东思想的过程中，在向阶级敌人作斗争的过程中，在同工农群众打成一片的过程中，在狠夺头脑中“私”字的“权”的过程中，不断地得到克服的。
    用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的亿万群众，用大民主的方法，自下而上地对各级领导实行革命的监督，这是我们抵制资产阶级思想的侵袭，防止修正主义的最可靠的保证。
    历史的鉴定是无情的。革命的车轮滚滚向前。
    我们坚定地相信，在无产阶级文化大革命中冲杀出来的，立了功勋的革命闯将，是能够听毛主席的话，不断改造思想，永远做人民的勤务员，永远和群众同甘共苦的。我们无产阶级革命派的同志们，一定能够经受得起夺权以后的新的严峻的考验。
