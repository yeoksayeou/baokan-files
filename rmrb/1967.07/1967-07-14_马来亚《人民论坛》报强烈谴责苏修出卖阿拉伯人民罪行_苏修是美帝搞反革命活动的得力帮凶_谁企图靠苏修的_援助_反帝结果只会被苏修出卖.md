Newspaper reports: Singapore news: The Malayan newspaper "People's Forum," published in Singapore, recently published an article strongly condemning the new crimes of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique in colluding with American imperialism and its tool of aggression, Israel, to betray the revolutionary interests of the Arab countries. It emphasizes that opposing imperialism necessarily means opposing revisionism, which is an unshakable law.

The article exposes that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique verbally supports the struggle of the Arab people but in reality, it is falsely supporting and truly betraying, thereby encouraging Israeli aggression and boosting Israeli arrogance.

The article points out that the Soviet revisionist leadership clique is not a friend of the Arab people but is the most capable accomplice of American imperialism in its counter-revolutionary activities around the world. Those who rely on Soviet "aid" will be dragged into the trap of American imperialism and suffer great losses.

The article emphasizes, "Opposing imperialism necessarily means opposing revisionism. If you do not oppose revisionism, you cannot effectively oppose imperialism. Attempting to rely on the 'aid' of revisionism to oppose imperialism will only result in being betrayed by the revisionists, causing your anti-imperialist cause to suffer setbacks. This is indeed an unshakable law. Today, the Arab people's struggle against American and Israeli aggression once again vividly proves this law."

The article states: The great leader and teacher of the Chinese people and the people of the world, Chairman Mao, teaches: "Oppressed peoples and oppressed nations must not place their liberation in the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its running dogs, but only through strengthening unity and persisting in struggle can they achieve victory." Currently, the Arab people are following Chairman Mao's teachings, launching a new wave of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, and the struggle against Soviet revisionist betrayal is surging.

The article states that in this struggle to defend national independence, the Arab people have recognized that it is the great China and the 700 million Chinese people who are their true and most reliable friends and comrades, which is a great and praiseworthy thing.

The article concludes by emphasizing, "We firmly believe that by following the direction indicated by Mao Zedong, the Arab people will definitely achieve final victory! The struggle of the people of the world against imperialism led by the United States and the reactionaries of various countries will definitely achieve final victory!"

    马来亚《人民论坛》报强烈谴责苏修出卖阿拉伯人民罪行
    苏修是美帝搞反革命活动的得力帮凶
    谁企图靠苏修的“援助”反帝结果只会被苏修出卖
    新华社讯　新加坡消息：在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《人民论坛》最近发表文章，强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义领导集团勾结美帝国主义及其侵略工具以色列，出卖阿拉伯各国人民革命利益的新罪行，强调反帝必须反修是一条不可动摇的定律。
    文章揭露，苏修领导集团口头上说支持阿拉伯人民的斗争，实际上是假支持、真出卖，从而鼓励了以色列的侵略，助长了以色列的气焰。
    文章指出，苏修领导集团根本不是阿拉伯人民的朋友，而是美帝国主义在全世界进行反革命活动的最得力的帮凶。谁指望苏修的“援助”，谁就会被它拖进美帝国主义的圈套，吃大亏。
    文章强调指出，“反帝必须反修，不反修，就不能有效地反帝，企图靠修正主义的‘援助’去反帝，结果只会被修正主义者出卖，使自己的反帝事业遭到挫折。这确实是一条不可动摇的定律。今天阿拉伯人民反对美、以侵略的斗争，再次生动地证明了这条定律。”
    文章说：中国人民和世界人民的伟大领袖和导师毛主席教导说：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”目前阿拉伯人民正遵循毛主席的教导，掀起一个反帝反修的新高潮，反对苏联修正主义背叛的斗争浪潮更是汹涌澎湃。
    文章说，在这场捍卫民族独立的斗争中，阿拉伯人民认清了伟大的中国和七亿中国人民才是他们真正的、最可靠的朋友和战友，这是一件值得大书特书的好事。
    文章最后强调，“我们坚信，沿着毛泽东所指引的方向前进，阿拉伯人民一定能取得最后胜利！全世界人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义和各国反动派的斗争一定能取得最后胜利！”
