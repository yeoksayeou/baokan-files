Hong Kong compatriots strongly protest British Hong Kong's "water rationing upgrade"

The British Hong Kong authorities implemented a water rationing scheme of supplying water for four hours every four days, attempting to force our patriotic compatriots to abandon their anti-British and anti-violence struggle. They also shamelessly shifted the blame for water restrictions to China. This is a despicable political conspiracy.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Hong Kong on the 25th, Hong Kong patriotic compatriots strongly protested the British Hong Kong authorities' implementation of the "water rationing upgrade" and demanded that the British Hong Kong authorities immediately cancel this unreasonable measure of persecuting Chinese compatriots.

Patriotic compatriots pointed out that the British Hong Kong authorities' "water rationing upgrade" is a despicable political conspiracy. It attempts to force our patriotic compatriots to abandon their anti-British and anti-violence struggle and shamelessly shifts the blame for water restrictions to China, but this will absolutely not succeed.

The British Hong Kong authorities began implementing severe water rationing on July 13th. At a press conference held on July 11th, the British Hong Kong "Director of Public Works," Ng Lik-tak, maliciously attributed the reason for implementing water rationing to "not receiving supplies from the Chinese side again." British Hong Kong "Water Supplies Department" officials and British Hong Kong's pro-government newspapers also repeatedly played political tricks on the issue of implementing water rationing.

On the 24th, the Hong Kong "Wen Wei Po" published a statement from the "Revolutionary Rebels of the Dongjiang-Shenzhen Water Supply Engineering Bureau," exposing the British Hong Kong authorities' political conspiracy of "water rationing upgrade." The statement pointed out that since March 1965, when water supplies to Hong Kong began, the revolutionary workers of our bureau, with great concern for the Hong Kong Chinese compatriots and strictly adhering to the agreement, have maintained normal water supplies to Hong Kong. According to the agreement between the two sides, the annual water supply is 150 billion gallons, with the supply period starting from October 1st of each year to June 30th of the following year, totaling nine months. In this year, our bureau not only completed the agreed water supply five days ahead of schedule but also, at the request of the British Hong Kong authorities, supplied an additional 18 billion gallons of water. This fully demonstrates that the Chinese government and people are very concerned about the water difficulties of Hong Kong Chinese compatriots. The British Hong Kong authorities' attempt to shift the blame for water rationing to China is completely a political conspiracy played by the British Hong Kong authorities, which absolutely cannot deceive Hong Kong patriotic compatriots.

An article published in the Hong Kong "Ta Kung Pao" on the 12th exposed the British Hong Kong authorities' conspiracy to implement "water rationing upgrade" as an attempt to soften the anti-British and anti-violence spirit of Hong Kong patriotic compatriots. The article said that the year 1963, which the British Hong Kong authorities considered the "most severe water shortage in history," had a storage of 3.32 billion gallons in early May, and could still implement a daily water supply of three hours. Now, with a reservoir storage of 3.277 billion gallons, they insist on implementing severe water rationing of four hours every four days. This is a political conspiracy by the British Hong Kong authorities to persecute Chinese compatriots.

According to a report from the British Hong Kong "Information Services Department," by July 22nd, the water storage in Hong Kong reservoirs had increased from 3.277 billion gallons at the time of implementing the "water rationing upgrade" on July 13th to 5.645 billion gallons. However, the British Hong Kong authorities have yet to show any indication of canceling the unreasonable measure of "water rationing upgrade."

Recently, compatriots from various industries in Hong Kong have written to newspapers, exposing the British Hong Kong authorities' conspiracy and strongly protesting the unreasonable persecution.

    香港同胞强烈抗议港英“升级制水”
    港英当局实施每四天供水四小时的“升级制水”，妄图迫使我爱国同胞放弃反英抗暴斗争，并卑鄙地把限制供水的责任转嫁到中国身上。这是一个可耻的政治阴谋。
    据新华社香港二十五日电　香港爱国同胞对港英当局实施每四天供水四小时的“升级制水”，表示强烈抗议，要求港英当局立即取消这一迫害中国同胞的无理措施。
    爱国同胞指出，港英当局的“升级制水”是一个可耻的政治阴谋，它妄图迫使我爱国同胞放弃反英抗暴斗争，并且卑鄙地把限制供水的责任转嫁到中国身上，但这是绝对不能得逞的。
    港英当局对香港同胞实施严厉制水是从七月十三日开始的。港英“工务司”邬励德在七月十一日举行的记者招待会上，竟把实行制水的原因诬蔑为“未再获得中国方面的供应”。港英“水务局”官员和港英的御用报纸，也一再在实施制水问题上大耍政治阴谋。
    香港《文汇报》二十四日登载了“东江—深圳供水工程管理局革命造反派”的一篇声明，揭穿了港英“制水升级”的政治阴谋。声明指出，从一九六五年三月向香港供水以来，我局革命职工抱着对香港中国同胞的极大关怀和本着严格遵守协议的原则，一直保持正常向香港供水。根据双方协议，每年供水量为一百五十亿加仑，供水期由每年十月一日起到下一年六月三十日止，共九个月。在本年度，我局不仅提前五天完成了协议所订的供水量，而且还应港英当局的要求，额外供应了十八亿加仑的食水。这足以说明我国政府和人民对香港中国同胞的食水困难是十分关心的，港英当局企图把制水的责任转嫁到中国，这完全是港英当局玩弄的政治阴谋，这是绝对欺骗不了香港爱国同胞的。
    香港《大公报》十二日发表的一篇文章，揭露了港英当局实行“升级制水”是妄图软化香港爱国同胞的反英抗暴斗志的阴谋。文章说，被港英认为“历史上最严重的一次水荒”的一九六三年，这年五月初存水量为三十亿三千二百万加仑，也能实行每日供水三小时。而现在水塘存水量仍有三十二亿七千七百万加仑，竟要实行每四天供水四小时的严厉制水，这是港英蓄意迫害中国同胞的政治阴谋。
    据港英“新闻处”报道，至七月二十二日止，香港水塘存水量已从七月十三日实施“升级制水”时的三十二亿七千七百万加仑增加到五十六亿四千五百万加仑。但是，港英当局至今仍没有取消“升级制水”的无理措施的表示。
    香港各行各业同胞最近纷纷写信给报社，戳穿港英的阴谋，并对港英的无理迫害提出严重抗议。
