The PLA in Qinghai Province is firmly upholding the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. It resolutely supports the revolutionary leftists and resolutely unites with the majority of the masses. With the help of the stationed troops, the proletarian revolutionary faction has gained absolute political superiority and is becoming increasingly organized and powerful.

The PLA in Qinghai Province, following the instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao, firmly supports the proletarian revolutionary faction and unites with the majority of the masses. It also helps the proletarian revolutionary faction study Chairman Mao's works, continuously improving their political and ideological levels and their ability to struggle. The "August 18th" and other revolutionary organizations, with the help of the PLA, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, strictly distinguish between enemies and ourselves, unite with the majority of the masses, and have gained absolute political superiority and are becoming increasingly organized and powerful.

The proletarian revolutionary faction "August 18th" and other revolutionary organizations in Qinghai Province have always firmly grasped the direction of the struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, concentrating their efforts on fiercely fighting against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. They understand that only by fiercely striking down the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and thoroughly exposing their anti-Party, anti-socialist crimes and their implementation of the bourgeois reactionary line, can we truly liberate a large area and unite the majority. Therefore, after smashing the counter-revolutionary restoration tide, they held many meetings to criticize and struggle against the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the province and units.

Through criticism and struggle, the masses who were deceived and joined the conservative organizations saw the large number of evil facts of this handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists suppressing the revolutionary mass movement, manipulating conservative organizations, inciting the masses to fight against the masses, and brutally persecuting revolutionary organizations. Many of them awakened and resolutely drew a clear line with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Revolutionary fighters also recognized that this handful of people are the masterminds behind the counter-revolutionary restoration tide. They said, "In the past, I hated those who joined the conservative organizations. Now, I hate the handful of capitalist-roaders within the old Qinghai Provincial Party Committee even more. I hate China's Khrushchev even more. We must direct our struggle fiercely against this handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists."

To avoid injuring our own class brothers while fiercely striking down a handful of enemies, and to achieve the goal of uniting the majority to fight against the enemy, the comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction seriously studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and related discussions. Revolutionary faction comrades deeply felt from Chairman Mao's works that distinguishing between enemies and ourselves, correctly handling two types of different contradictions, is related to whether we can unite the deceived masses to make a revolution together, and whether the Cultural Revolution can be thoroughly victorious. The "August 18th" Red Guards of a certain automobile factory suffered heavy persecution from the bourgeois reactionary line. Some comrades initially thought that anyone who had beaten the "August 18th" fighters had contradictions with the proletarian revolutionary faction that were antagonistic. After studying Chairman Mao's works, they realized that this way of looking at problems lacked a class perspective. They conducted a class analysis of the masses in their unit who had joined the conservative organizations and realized that the vast majority of those who joined the conservative organizations were deceived and were also victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. The contradictions between the proletarian revolutionary faction and them are contradictions among the people. After research and analysis, everyone became clear-minded, knowing whom to rely on, whom to unite with, and whom to strike against, making the direction of the struggle clearer.

Chairman Mao said: "The methods of resolving the two types of contradictions are different because the nature of the contradictions between enemies and us and those among the people are different." At the beginning, some fighters of "August 18th" thought that winning over and educating those who had joined the conservative organizations was "right opportunism"; some thought, "In the past, they beat us up badly, this time we must get even." The "August 18th" and other revolutionary organizations, in response to these active thoughts, educated everyone to follow Chairman Mao's instructions and adopt different methods to handle different types of contradictions. They firmly implement dictatorship over the class enemies; to resolve contradictions among the people, they do not use curses or fists, but use the method of "unity-criticism-unity."

Because the proletarian revolutionary faction adopted the correct method to handle two types of different contradictions, it dispelled the concerns of many deceived masses. Many in the conservative organizations originally had many concerns, fearing that the "August 18th" and other revolutionary organizations would take revenge. But the facts were completely the opposite. The fighters of the "August 18th" and other revolutionary organizations not only did not strike back at them but also, according to the principle of "revolution is not divided into early and late, rebellion is not divided into first and last," welcomed them back to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The deceived masses excitedly said: "The comrades of 'August 18th' strictly demand of themselves and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, do not hold personal grudges, and have the breadth of the proletarian revolutionary faction."

The "August 18th" proletarian revolutionary faction not only correctly treats the deceived masses but also can unite comrades within their own ranks who hold different opinions. When the revolutionary factions in Qinghai Province were uniting, some leaders of revolutionary organizations, due to the "self" interfering with their minds, had wrong thoughts such as "I am an old rebel, you are a new rebel," "your troops are fewer, my troops are more, do you want to unite? You have to 'combine' with me." After discovering this trend, the Qinghai Military District's leftist leadership group firmly grasped the study of Chairman Mao's works and helped them carry out rectification activities. After a fierce debate and a struggle to eliminate selfishness and establish public-mindedness, some leaders of revolutionary organizations clarified the great significance of revolutionary unity and actively promoted revolutionary unity.

    驻青海省人民解放军高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    坚决支持革命左派　坚决团结群众大多数
    在驻军帮助下，无产阶级革命派政治上取得绝对优势，组织上日益发展壮大
    本报讯　青海省驻军遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导，既坚定不移地支持无产阶级革命派，又坚定不移地团结群众大多数，并帮助无产阶级革命派学习毛主席著作，不断提高政治思想水平和斗争水平。八·一八等革命组织在解放军帮助下，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，严格区分敌我，团结群众大多数，在政治上取得绝对优势，在组织上日益发展壮大。
    青海省无产阶级革命派“八·一八”等革命组织，在无产阶级文化大革命中始终紧紧掌握了斗争的大方向，集中力量狠斗党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。他们认识到：只有狠狠地打击一小撮党内走资本主义道路当权派，彻底揭露他们反党反社会主义和推行资产阶级反动路线的罪行，才能真正解放一大片，团结大多数。因此，他们在粉碎反革命复辟逆流后，多次开会，对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和本省、本单位的党内一小撮反革命修正主义分子，进行大批判大斗争。
    通过批判斗争，参加保守组织的受蒙蔽群众，看清了这一小撮反革命修正主义分子压制革命群众运动，操纵保守组织，挑动群众斗群众，残酷迫害革命组织的大量罪恶事实，不少人觉醒过来，坚决与党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界限。革命派战士也认清了这一小撮家伙是反革命复辟逆流的幕后指使者。他们说，过去我恨那些参加保守组织的人，现在我恨旧青海省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，更恨中国的赫鲁晓夫，一定要把斗争矛头狠狠对准这一小撮反革命修正主义分子。
    为了在狠狠打击一小撮敌人的时候，尽可能不误伤自己的阶级兄弟，达到团结大多数、共同对敌的目的，无产阶级革命派的同志认真学习了毛主席的光辉著作
  《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和有关论述。革命派同志从毛主席的著作中，深深地体会到，分清敌我，正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，是关系到能不能团结受蒙蔽的群众一道干革命的问题，是关系到文化大革命能不能彻底胜利的问题。某汽车厂“八·一八”红卫战斗队受资产阶级反动路线迫害很重，有些同志起初认为凡是殴打过“八·一八”战士的人，与无产阶级革命派的矛盾都是敌我矛盾。学习毛主席著作以后，他们认识到这样看问题缺乏阶级观点，就对本单位参加过保守组织的群众进行了阶级分析，认识到参加保守组织的群众绝大多数是受蒙蔽的，也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。无产阶级革命派与他们的矛盾是人民内部矛盾。经过研究分析，大家心明眼亮了，知道了应该依靠谁，团结谁，打击谁，斗争方向更加明确了。
    毛主席说：“敌我之间和人民内部的这两类矛盾的性质不同，解决的方法也不同。”开始，“八·一八”有的战士认为，争取和教育那些参加过保守组织的群众是“右倾”；有的认为“过去他们狠狠地打我们，这一回非出口气不可。”“八·一八”等革命组织针对这些活思想，教育大家遵照毛主席的教导，对不同性质的矛盾，采取不同的处理方法。他们对阶级敌人，坚决实行专政；解决人民内部矛盾，不是用咒骂，也不是用拳头，而是用“团结——批评——团结”的方法。
    无产阶级革命派由于采取了正确的方法处理两类不同性质的矛盾，解除了许多受蒙蔽的群众的顾虑。保守组织中有不少人，原来有很多顾虑，怕“八·一八”等革命组织报复。但事实与他们的想法完全相反，“八·一八”等革命组织的战士，对他们不但没有打击报复，而且按照“革命不分早晚，造反不分先后”的原则，欢迎他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来。受蒙蔽的群众激动地说：“八·一八”的同志严格要求自己，按照毛主席指示办事，不记个人私仇，有无产阶级革命派的胸怀。
    “八·一八”无产阶级革命派不仅能正确地对待受蒙蔽的群众，而且能够团结自己队伍内部持有不同意见的同志。当青海省革命派大联合的时候，一些革命组织的负责人由于头脑中“私”字作怪，什么“我是老造反，你是后造反”，“你的兵马少，我的兵力大，要大联合吗？你就得‘结合’我。”等等错误思想，影响革命组织的大联合。青海军区支左领导小组发现这个苗头以后，就狠抓毛主席著作学习，帮助他们开展整风活动。经过一场激烈的辩论和破私立公的思想斗争，某些革命组织负责人明确了革命大联合的伟大意义，积极促进革命的大联合。
