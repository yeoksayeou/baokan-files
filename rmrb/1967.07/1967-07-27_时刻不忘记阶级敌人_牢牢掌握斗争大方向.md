	Harbin No. 47 Middle School originally had two major revolutionary mass organizations—the Red Rebel Corps and the Red Rebel General Corps. Due to disagreements between the two organizations, they always focused on each other's shortcomings and could not unite, which affected the criticism of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. In March of this year, the People's Liberation Army went to No. 47 Middle School to conduct military and political training. They guided revolutionary teachers and students to study Chairman Mao's "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and other articles, conducted bitter lessons education, recalled the experiences of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and organized debates on what the nature of the contradictions between the two organizations was. Through the debates, members of both organizations unanimously recognized that the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are our main enemies. They are scheming to restore capitalism in our country and attempt to drag us back to the sinful old society. Our contradictions with them are irreconcilable contradictions, and we should concentrate our efforts to expose, criticize, and struggle against them. This is the big picture, the fundamental principle. The contradictions between revolutionary organizations, even if some are principled disagreements, are still contradictions within the people, secondary contradictions, and can be completely resolved through the method of "unity-criticism-unity."

	The big principle governs the small principle, and the small principle must follow the big principle. Under this guidance, the two organizations began to rectify their work and conduct self-criticism. They realized that previously they only saw others' shortcomings and mistakes, making some trivial issues seem very important. This was wrong. Through rectification and self-criticism, both organizations discovered that they had many shortcomings and problems: such as localism, cliquism, and the idea that "I alone am left." Some people also examined their personal motives, for example, some people were leaders in the Rebel Corps, but after the merger, they became nothing in their classes, or their positions were very "small," so they did not want to participate; some people had erroneous thoughts of seeking fame, profit, and status for their small groups. Members of both organizations realized that it was precisely these non-proletarian thoughts that caused them to fight "internal wars" for a period, resulting in the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party taking advantage of the situation. They said, this is truly unacceptable, we must always remember the class enemies and the direction of struggle, and we must unite.

	By distinguishing between major and minor issues and correctly handling contradictions within the people, this school has successfully achieved revolutionary unity and resumed classes amidst the revolution.

    时刻不忘记阶级敌人
    牢牢掌握斗争大方向
    哈尔滨四十七中原来有两个大的革命群众组织——红色造反团与红色造反总团。两个组织因为互相之间有分歧，总是揪住对方的缺点不放，一直联合不起来，影响到对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的批判。今年三月份，解放军到四十七中进行军政训练。他们辅导革命师生学习毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》等文章，进行忆苦教育，回忆无产阶级文化大革命的斗争经历，并组织辩论：到底两个组织之间的矛盾是什么性质？通过辩论，两个组织的成员一致认识到，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派是我们最主要的敌人，他们阴谋在我国复辟资本主义，企图把我们拉回罪恶的旧社会去，我们和他们的矛盾是不可调和的矛盾，应当集中力量对他们进行大揭发、大批判、大斗争。这是大局，是大道理。革命组织之间的矛盾，即使有些是原则分歧，仍然是人民内部矛盾，次要矛盾，是完全可以通过“团结——批评——团结”的方法解决的。
    大道理管小道理，小道理要服从大道理。在这种思想的指导下，两个组织开始整风，进行自我批评。他们认识到，以前光看人家的缺点、错误，把一些枝节问题看的大得了不得。这是不对的。通过整风和自我批评，两个组织都发现了自己有不少缺点和问题：如山头主义、小团体主义、唯我独左等等非无产阶级思想。有些人还检查了自己的私心杂念，例如，有的人在造反团里是个头头，联合后回到班里就什么也不是了，或者职务很“小”，所以不愿干；有的人存在着为小团体争名利、争地位等错误思想。两个组织的成员认识到，正是由于这种种非无产阶级思想作怪，彼此在一段时间里打“内战”，结果让党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派钻了空子。他们说，这真是太不应该了，一定要时刻不忘阶级敌人，时刻不忘斗争的大方向，一定要联合起来。
    由于分清了大是大非和小是小非的问题，正确处理了人民内部矛盾，这个学校已顺利地实现了革命的大联合，实现了复课闹革命。
