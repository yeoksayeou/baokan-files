The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China sent a note to the Indonesian Embassy in China on July 5, issuing another solemn warning to the Indonesian government for its shameless anti-China and anti-Chinese campaigns and the brutal persecution of overseas Chinese.

The note said: On September 2, 1966, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Republic of Indonesia notified the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia that 4,500 overseas Chinese had been unjustly expelled from the Aceh region and concentrated in Medan, demanding that the Chinese government send ships to take them back to China. The Chinese government, on one hand, sternly demanded that the Indonesian government immediately stop the racist atrocity of collectively expelling overseas Chinese; on the other hand, sent ships to Medan to rescue the suffering overseas Chinese. So far, the Chinese government has brought back 4,251 people. However, it is understood that there are still more than 6,600 suffering overseas Chinese in 14 concentration camps in the Medan area. This fully shows that the Indonesian government, instead of stopping the collective expulsion of overseas Chinese, has continued and even expanded its persecution of overseas Chinese, in an attempt to achieve its evil goal of promoting racism.

The note pointed out: Chinese ships have gone to Medan four times to rescue the suffering overseas Chinese, but have been obstructed and harassed by the Indonesian side in various ways, making the rescue work unable to proceed smoothly. The Indonesian government has wantonly trampled on international norms in its treatment of the Chinese consul in Medan, creating endless troubles and setting up numerous obstacles. As early as the third voyage, the Indonesian government unreasonably limited the number of Chinese rescue personnel, issuing visas for only seven people, seriously affecting the rescue work. Before the fourth voyage, the Indonesian government also delayed the visa issue for two months. During the four stops of the Chinese rescue ship in the Belawan port, the Indonesian authorities have been in violation of international customs, not allowing Chinese crew members to go ashore.

The note said: We solemnly warn the Indonesian reactionaries again that your shameless anti-China and anti-Chinese campaigns will only backfire, and you will reap what you sow. The broad masses of overseas Chinese, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have reached the limit of their endurance and will rise up to defend their legitimate rights and interests, and will firmly carry out the struggle against persecution to the end. The Chinese government and the Chinese people will, under any circumstances, fully support the just struggle of the broad masses of overseas Chinese. This position and resolve are unshakable.

The note finally said: To solve the problem of the suffering overseas Chinese created by the Indonesian government, the Chinese government makes the following demands to the Indonesian government:

1. The Indonesian government should immediately stop anti-China and anti-Chinese campaigns. The Chinese government reaffirms the right to demand as it has done before.

2. Immediately arrange for the Chinese consul in Medan, Zhang Yu, and his staff to return to Medan to perform their normal duties, handle overseas Chinese affairs in the Medan area, and arrange for the return of the suffering overseas Chinese.

3. The thousands of suffering overseas Chinese currently concentrated in Medan have been reduced to poverty and have no means of livelihood, which is entirely the doing of the Indonesian government. The Indonesian government must take effective measures to genuinely guarantee their livelihood and bear the responsibility for guaranteeing their living conditions.

4. Immediately arrange for the Chinese Embassy in Indonesia to send consuls to East Java and West Kalimantan and other places to investigate and inspect the situation of overseas Chinese who have suffered persecution.

The Indonesian government should respond promptly to the above demands.

　　我外交部对印尼政府疯狂反华排华再次提出严正警告
　　印尼政府反华只能搬起石头砸自己的脚
　　印尼当局必须对中国政府提出的四项要求迅速作出答复
    据新华社五日讯　中华人民共和国外交部五日照会印度尼西亚驻华大使馆，对印尼政府肆无忌惮地反华排华，疯狂迫害华侨的暴行再次提出严正警告。
    照会说：一九六六年九月二日印度尼西亚共和国外交部通知中国驻印尼大使馆，从亚齐地区被无理驱逐到棉兰集中的受害华侨共有四千五百人，要求中国政府派船把他们接运回国。中国政府一方面严正要求印尼政府，立即停止集体驱逐华侨的种族主义暴行；一方面派船前往棉兰接运处于水深火热之中的受害华侨。到目前为止，中国政府已经接回四千二百五十一名。但是，据了解，在棉兰地区十四个集中营中，仍有六千六百多名受害华侨。这就充分说明，印尼政府利用中国接侨的机会，非但没有停止，反而继续扩大对华侨的集体驱逐，妄图达到它推行种族主义的罪恶目的。
    照会指出：中国船只四次前往棉兰接运受害华侨，都受到印尼方面的种种阻挠和刁难，致使接侨工作不能顺利进行。对中国领事在棉兰履行正常职务，印尼政府恣意践踏国际关系准则，不断制造麻烦和设置重重障碍。早在第三航次印尼政府即无理限制中国接侨工作人员的人数，只发七个人的签证。严重影响接侨工作。第四航次启航前，印尼政府又在签证问题上拖延达两个月之久。中国接侨船四次停留勿拉湾港口期间，印尼当局一直违反国际惯例，不让中国船员登岸。
    照会说：我们再次严正警告印尼反动派，你们这样肆无忌惮地反华排华，只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚，自食其果。用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大华侨，忍无可忍，必将奋起为维护自己的正当权益，坚决地把反迫害的斗争进行到底。中国政府和中国人民，在任何情况下，都将给予广大华侨的正义斗争以全力支持，这个立场和决心是坚定不移的，不可动摇的。
    照会最后说：为了解决印尼政府一手制造的受害华侨问题，中国政府向印尼政府提出如下要求：
    一、印尼政府应立即停止反华排华。中国政府重申保留历次提出要求的权利。
    二、立即安排中国驻棉兰领事张峪和工作人员返回棉兰，履行他的正常职务，处理棉兰地区的华侨事务，安排受害华侨的回国工作。
    三、目前被集中在棉兰的数以千计的受害华侨，倾家荡产，生活无着，这完全是印尼政府一手造成的，印尼政府必须采取有效措施切实保障他们的生计，并承担保障他们的生活的责任。
    四、立即安排中国驻印尼大使馆派出领事前往东爪哇和西加里曼丹等地，调查和视察华侨遭受迫害的情况。
    印尼政府应就上述要求迅速作出答复。
