The reactionary Burmese government deliberately sabotages Sino-Burmese relations and the Sino-Burmese economic and technical cooperation agreement. The Chinese Embassy in Burma lodges the strongest protest. The note sternly points out that the reactionary Burmese government has driven Chinese economic aid work in Burma to the point where it cannot be carried out, and you must bear all the serious consequences that arise from this.

BEIJING, July 6 (Xinhua) — YANGON, July 5 — The Chinese Embassy in Burma sent a note to the Burmese Foreign Ministry on July 5, lodging the strongest protest against the reactionary Burmese government's deliberate sabotage of bilateral relations and the Sino-Burmese economic and technical cooperation agreement.

The note pointed out that in the anti-China and anti-Chinese wave it instigated, which swept across Burma, the reactionary Burmese government committed heinous fascist atrocities unprecedented in the history of international relations. The seven hundred million Chinese people will never forget this blood debt! The reactionary Burmese government has gone to such lengths of madness, openly and brazenly sabotaging the economic and technical cooperation agreement between the two countries, sabotaging Chinese economic aid work in Burma, and pushing this work to the point where it cannot be carried out.

The note listed the crimes committed by the reactionary Burmese government in sabotaging the Sino-Burmese economic and technical cooperation agreement as follows:

On the night of June 27, the reactionary Burmese government incited hundreds of thugs to break into the Chinese Embassy's Economic Counselor's Office, which is responsible for economic aid work, completely destroying the facility and looting and burning a large amount of living supplies and other property used by the experts.

On June 28, the reactionary Burmese government incited a large group of thugs to brutally attack the Chinese Embassy, killing Chinese expert Liu Yi on the spot, creating an unprecedented tragedy in the history of international diplomacy. On June 27 and 28, the reactionary Burmese government organized thugs to provoke and shout anti-China slogans at the residence of the Chinese Embassy's Economic Counselor's Office multiple times.

On June 28, thugs set fire to the Chinese experts' guesthouse at the Yangon Women's Hospital, attempting to harm Chinese experts.

After the reactionary Burmese government instigated anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities, the Burmese side claimed that it could not guarantee the safety of Chinese experts on the construction sites, unreasonably demanding that the experts be concentrated in one location and dispatching military police to guard the location, restricting the experts' freedom of movement.

What is even more intolerable is that, according to a report by the Burmese official newspaper "The Mirror" on July 1, thugs organized by the reactionary Burmese government shouted anti-China slogans during an anti-China demonstration in Mandalay, and even maliciously slandered that "Chinese experts are spies." This is a malicious slander against Chinese experts and the Chinese people.

The note pointed out: "It is well known that to help Burma with its economic construction, Chinese experts, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, traveled thousands of miles to Burma, working wholeheartedly and tirelessly for Burma's economic construction, making outstanding contributions. Together with the broad masses of Burmese workers, they built the Gantgaw Bridge and the Bilin Sugar Mill at high speed and high quality, and are currently constructing the Shwebo Paper Mill, the Chaungtone Textile Mill, the Swar Bamboo Plywood Factory, and the Thagyi Bridge. The Chinese experts are upright and their achievements are evident to all. However, the reactionary Burmese government, for the sake of its anti-China and anti-Chinese needs, has the audacity to repay kindness with enmity, and to harm, attack, loot, burn, destroy, and maliciously attack the Chinese experts and the leading agency for implementing the Sino-Burmese economic and technical cooperation agreement, the Chinese Embassy's Economic Counselor's Office."

The note finally pointed out: "The series of fascist atrocities committed by the reactionary Burmese government has already seriously sabotaged the implementation of the Sino-Burmese economic and technical cooperation agreement. The personal safety of Chinese experts in Burma has been seriously threatened, and they are unable to work normally. We solemnly warn the reactionary Burmese government that you must bear all the serious consequences that arise from this."

　　缅甸反动政府蓄意破坏中缅两国关系和中缅经济技术合作协定
　　我驻缅大使馆提出最最强烈抗议
    照会严正指出，缅甸反动政府疯狂地把中国对缅经援工作推到了无法进行的地步，你们必须承担由此而产生的一切严重后果
    新华社六日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆五日照会缅甸外交部，就缅甸反动政府蓄意破坏两国关系，破坏中缅经济技术合作协定的罪行，提出最最强烈的抗议。
    照会指出，缅甸反动政府在它一手掀起的席卷全缅甸的反华排华浪潮中，犯下了国际关系史上骇人听闻的法西斯暴行，七亿中国人民将永远记住这笔血债！缅甸反动政府竟疯狂到如此程度，公然明目张胆地破坏两国经济技术合作协定，破坏中国对缅经援工作，把这一工作推到无法进行的地步。
    照会列举缅甸反动政府破坏中缅经济技术合作协定的罪行如下：
    六月二十七日凌晨，缅甸反动政府纵容暴徒数百人，破门冲进我负责经援工作的中国大使馆经济参赞处，将这一机构全部捣毁，并抢劫焚烧供专家使用的大批生活物资及其他财物。
    六月二十八日，缅甸反动政府纵容大批暴徒野蛮袭击中国大使馆时，当场杀害中国专家刘逸，造成了国际外交史上空前未有的惨案。六月二十七日和二十八日，缅甸反动政府又连续多次组织暴徒在中国大使馆经济参赞处驻地挑衅，狂呼反华口号。
    六月二十八日，暴徒纵火焚烧仰光温德米院四号中国专家招待所，企图谋害中国专家。
    在缅甸反动政府一手制造了反华排华暴行后，缅方声称不能保证工地中国专家的安全，无理要求专家集中住地，并派军警看守住地，限制专家的行动自由。
    更加令人不能容忍的是，据缅甸官方报纸《镜报》七月一日报道，由缅甸反动政府组织的暴徒在曼德勒举行反华示威时，狂叫反华口号，竟公然恶毒诬蔑“中国专家是间谍”。这是对中国专家和中国人民的恶毒诬蔑。
    照会指出：“众所周知，为了帮助缅甸进行经济建设，中国专家遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，不远千里来到缅甸，全心全意，不辞劳苦地为缅甸经济建设作出了卓越的贡献。他们与缅甸广大劳动人民一起高速度、高质量地建成了滚弄大桥、比林糖厂，并且正在进行雪当纸厂、春佟密铁拉纺织厂、斯瓦胶合板厂、太可桥等项工程。中国专家光明磊落，工作成果有目共睹。然而，缅甸反动政府为了它反华排华的需要，竟以怨报德，对中国专家和执行中缅经济技术合作协定的领导机构中国大使馆经济参赞处，进行残害、袭击、抢劫、焚烧、捣毁和恶毒攻击。”
    照会最后指出：“缅甸反动政府的这一系列法西斯暴行，已经使中缅经济技术合作协定的执行受到严重破坏。中国援缅专家人身安全已受到严重的威胁，无法正常进行工作。我们严正警告缅甸反动政府，你们必须承担由此而产生的一切严重后果。”
