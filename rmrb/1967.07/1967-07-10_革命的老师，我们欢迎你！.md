Thunder roars and lightning flashes.
The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by our dearest and reddest Red Sun, Chairman Mao, is sweeping across the entire nation with the force of a thousand thunderbolts and the might of a surging tide. In Shanghai, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the old municipal committee have been overthrown by the revolutionary masses, and the entire city is in a splendid new situation.

However, the movement in our school has not kept up with the changing situation. Some teachers are self-centered and have selfish thoughts, which hinder the smooth progress of the school's struggle, criticism, and transformation. Revolutionary teachers should arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, display revolutionary daring, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our school to the end. Below, we discuss some of the problems that still exist in the minds of some teachers:

1. Fear of not being a good teacher.
Some teachers, when faced with difficulties, shrink back and hesitate. Some even want to change jobs. They do not follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficulties there are, the more we should go there. This is what a good comrade should do." These teachers should use Mao Zedong Thought to overcome the "self" in their minds, get rid of the wrong idea of fearing to be a bad teacher, and follow Chairman Mao's instructions to work and struggle against difficulties. This is what a revolutionary teacher should do.

2. Fear of home visits.
Teachers conducting home visits is a good way to improve teacher-student relationships and mobilize parents and social forces to cooperate with the school in carrying out the revolution. However, some teachers are afraid to make home visits and afraid to talk to students. In short, they are afraid, not working with enthusiasm, but shrinking back, lacking revolutionary daring. We hope these teachers will arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, actively conduct home visits, and carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the class and school. We will definitely assist the teachers, and together we will make our school a great school of Mao Zedong Thought.

3. Fear of fighting against bad phenomena.
The bad phenomena in the school are mainly caused by a few students who damage public property, fight randomly, swear, and do not observe collective discipline. Sometimes, when teachers see these phenomena, they act as if they did not see them and walk away silently. A teacher's responsibility is to cultivate successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause and should seriously propagate the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention to correct the mistakes of these students. Students should also listen to Chairman Mao and observe the Three Main Rules of Discipline and Eight Points for Attention. Revolutionary teachers and students should unite closely, fight together, and win together.

Revolutionary teachers, we welcome you! Revolutionary teachers, we are your confidants. Your students welcome you, welcome you to have heart-to-heart talks, and welcome you to work together with us to carry out the revolution. We hope that some teachers will use Mao Zedong Thought to overcome the harmful "self," get rid of the fear, and together with the students, bravely fight, carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the school, and let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high in our school.

### 革命的老师，我们欢迎你！

　　革命的老师，我们欢迎你！
    雷声隆隆，电光闪闪。
    由我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，磅礴于全中国，震撼全世界。在上海，旧市委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派已被革命群众夺了权，全市是一片大好的新局面。
    但是，我们学校的运动还跟不上形势的发展。有的老师“我”字当头，“私”字在头脑里作怪，影响学校斗批改的顺利进行。革命的老师们应当用毛泽东思想来武装自己的头脑，发扬革命的大无畏精神，把我们学校的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。下面谈谈有的老师思想上还存在的问题：
    一、怕当不好老师。
    有的老师碰到点困难，就缩手缩脚，有的老师甚至想调换工作。他们不是象毛主席教导的那样：“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”这些老师们应当用毛泽东思想解决头脑里的“私”字，去掉“怕当不好老师”的错误想法，遵照毛主席的指示，迎着困难去工作、去斗争，这才是革命的老师。
    二、怕做家庭访问。
    老师进行家庭访问是搞好师生关系，发动家长和社会力量配合学校共同搞好复课闹革命的一个很好的办法。但是，有的老师怕做家庭访问，怕跟学生谈心。总而言之，“怕”字当头，不是满腔热忱地去工作，而是缩手缩脚，缺乏革命的大无畏精神。希望这些老师用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，积极进行家庭访问，将班级、学校的无产阶级文化大革命搞好。我们一定协助老师，一起把我们学校办成一所毛泽东思想大学校。
    三、怕跟坏现象作斗争。
    学校出现的不良现象，主要是少数同学破坏公共财物，随便打架，骂人，不遵守集体纪律。这些现象，有时老师看见了，就当作没有看见，不声不响地走了过去。老师的责任就是培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人，应该认真宣传三大纪律八项注意，使这部分同学能改正错误。学生也应该听毛主席的话，遵守三大纪律八项注意。革命师生要紧密地团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    革命的老师，我们欢迎你！革命的老师，我们是你们的知心人。你的学生欢迎你，欢迎你来谈心，欢迎你和我们共同搞好复课闹革命。我们希望某些老师用毛泽东思想克服害人的“私”字，去掉“怕”字，和同学们一起，勇敢战斗，搞好学校的斗批改，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗在我们学校高高飘扬。
