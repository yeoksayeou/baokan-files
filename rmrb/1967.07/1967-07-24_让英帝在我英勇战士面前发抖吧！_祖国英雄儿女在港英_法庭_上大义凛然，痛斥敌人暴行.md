In the magnificent struggle against British imperialism and violence, countless outstanding heroes and heroines, armed with the invincible thoughts of Mao Zedong, have been engaged in unyielding struggles against the enemy in their "courts."

They include workers, employees, young students, elderly educators, cultural workers, film workers, and journalists. Fearless of the enemy's torture and threats, they stand firm and speak with righteous indignation, turning the British "court" into a platform for exposing the fascist atrocities of British imperialism.

Workers from the Taikoo Dockyard, who were abducted by the British in the dead of night, were severely beaten by British fascist thugs, sustaining serious injuries. However, they stood tall and unyielding in the "court," using a wealth of facts to expose the despicable actions of the British authorities in colluding with British management at Taikoo to frame the workers.

The British authorities, in order to persecute them, fabricated charges and brought some iron pipes into the "court," claiming they were weapons made by the workers. The workers immediately questioned, "Are these iron pipes ours?" The British "detective assistant" replied, "I am not sure." The workers pressed, "Are these things ours?" The "assistant" again said, "I don't know." The workers, with righteous indignation, questioned the embarrassed British "witness" until he was at a loss for words.

The brave Taikoo workers also protested to the British "judge," stating that if they were beaten again, they would immediately go on a hunger strike. The British "judge" was stunned, then shamelessly said, "If you can identify who beat you, you can sue them in a civil case." The workers saw through the enemy's plot and would not be deceived, declaring that they would fight back with actual actions.

In the "May 22" massacre orchestrated by the British, patriotic compatriots who were unlawfully arrested by the British fearlessly denounced the fascist atrocities of the British in the "court," pointing out that the British authorities were the chief culprits behind the "May 22" massacre. A staff member of the Sanlian Bookstore, regarding the British authorities' fabricated charge of "riotous assembly," righteously exposed the political conspiracy of British imperialism to antagonize socialist China. He said, "The slogans we shouted were calling on the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon to love our motherland and to unite. What is wrong with these slogans?" The British "judge," flushed with embarrassment, did not allow him to continue. He ignored the "judge's" obstruction and continued, "The British authorities emphasize that our slogans are political. I want to point out that the 'political' nature the British authorities refer to is that they do not allow our compatriots to love our motherland."

A twenty-year-old staff member of the Sanlian Bookstore questioned the "judge," "If you, the 'judge,' and a few friends went to the 'Governor's House' to protest, and someone blocked your way, you asked those who unreasonably blocked you, but you were beaten by them instead, and then you raised your hand in self-defense, only to be unlawfully arrested and unjustly accused of 'riot,' how would you view this 'charge'?" The British "judge" was left speechless by the young man's sharp sarcasm. An eighteen-year-old female employee of a patriotic bank angrily questioned the British so-called "witness," "How do you explain the term 'riot'?" The "witness" said he did not understand. She asked again, "How did I obstruct public order?" The "witness" could not answer. She said, "I want to ask you, if you cannot even explain the definitions of 'riot' and 'obstructing public order,' how can you use such charges to accuse someone?" The "witness" was questioned to the point of turning pale and trembling. This brave female employee declared resolutely, "All of this is nonsense. The fact is that I went to the 'Governor's House' to protest..." Before she could finish, the "judge" hurriedly said, "This is a political issue, unrelated to this case," and abruptly ended the "trial."

The British group of so-called "judges" are both cowardly and brutal, hiding behind the hypocritical cloak of "democracy" and "freedom" to commit evil deeds. An eighteen-year-old patriotic middle school student was severely tortured by British henchmen, forcing him to confess to the "crime" of writing slogans. In the "court," he resolutely refused to plead guilty. The "judge," having no other recourse, feigned sympathy and said he would "pardon" him due to his youth, releasing him without charge, but demanded that he sign a "behavioral restraint" agreement. The student stood tall and justly refused to sign. He pointed out that he had committed no crime, so why should he sign a "behavioral restraint" agreement? The "judge," seeing his plot exposed, revealed his fascist ugly face, and sentenced the student to eight months in prison for "stubborn attitude" and "refusal to sign," among other absurd "charges."

Teachers, students, and parents who were present in the "court" witnessed the British authorities' shameful actions and were extremely angry. They immediately pointed at the "judge" and protested in stern words. The "judge" was so frightened that he hastily "adjourned" and fled.

On July 11, Xue Ping, a reporter from the Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch, who was abducted by the British fascist authorities, stood firm and unyielding in the enemy's "court," conducting a righteous and stern trial of the wicked British imperialism, exposing with irrefutable facts the anti-China conspiracy of British imperialism. At the same time, on July 15, two reporters from the Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch, Chen Fengying and Chen Demu, and five reporters from patriotic newspapers, along with twenty-one patriotic educators who were unlawfully arrested at the same time, formed a heroic united front in the enemy's "court," bravely engaging in a head-to-head struggle with the enemy. Each of them was spirited and full of fighting spirit, protesting with unyielding voices against the British fascist authorities' unlawful arrests and "interrogations." When a sixty-two-year-old patriotic school principal appeared in "court," he said, word by word, "I protest! I protest! I protest your unlawful arrests and 'interrogations,' and I protest the beatings of others during detention." His unyielding demeanor made the officials in the "court" dare not look him in the eye.

Our countless brave anti-imperialist patriotic warriors are truly outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation. In the enemy's prisons and "courts," they remain unyielding and brave in struggle, greatly boosting the morale of the revolutionary people and striking a heavy blow to the prestige of British imperialism. Let British imperialism tremble before our brave warriors!

    让英帝在我英勇战士面前发抖吧！
    祖国英雄儿女在港英“法庭”上大义凛然，痛斥敌人暴行
    据新华社香港二十三日电　在气壮山河的反英抗暴斗争中，无数优秀的英雄儿女，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，在敌人“法庭”上，同敌人进行着不屈不挠的斗争。
    他们有工人、职员，有青少年学生和年迈的教育工作者，有文化工作者、电影工作者和新闻工作者。他们不怕敌人的严刑拷打和威吓，屹然挺立，义正词严，把港英“法庭”变成审判港英帝国主义法西斯暴行的讲坛。
    被港英黑夜绑架的太古船坞工人，虽然遭受港英法西斯暴徒毒打，身受重伤，但他们大义凛然，威武不屈，在“法庭”上以大量的事实，揭露港英当局勾结太古英国资方陷害工人的卑鄙行为。
    港英当局为了对他们横加迫害，竟胡加罪名，把一些铁水管搬到“法庭”上，硬说是工人制造的“武器”。工人立即质问：“这些铁管是否我们工人的？”港英“侦缉帮办”答：“我不清楚。”工人追问：“这些东西是不是我们的？”这个什么“帮办”又说：“我不知道”。工人们义正词严地把理屈心虚的港英“证人”质问得狼狈万分。
    英勇的太古工人还向港英“法官”提出抗议，声明如果再遭殴打，他们就立即进行绝食斗争。港英“法官”吓得目瞪口呆，继而大耍无赖，说什么“如果认出打你的人，可循民事提出控告。”工人们识破敌人的阴谋，决不受敌人的欺骗，表示要以实际行动进行斗争。
    在港英一手制造的“五·二二”血案中，被港英无理逮捕的爱国同胞，在“法庭”上无所畏惧地控诉港英的法西斯暴行，指出港英当局就是“五·二二”血案的罪魁祸首。一位三联书店职工就港英当局强加的所谓“暴动性集会”的“罪名”，正气凛然地揭露港英帝国主义敌视社会主义中国的政治阴谋。他说：“我们当时喊的口号是叫港九同胞热爱我们的祖国，叫港九同胞团结起来。这些口号有什么不好？”港英“法官”被问得面红耳赤，不许他说下去，他不管“法官”的阻挠，继续指出：“港英当局强调我们喊的口号有政治性，我要指出，港英当局所说的‘政治性’，就是不准我们的同胞热爱我们的祖国。”
    一位二十岁的三联书店职员质问“法官”：“如果你‘法官’与几位朋友去‘港督府’抗议，前面有人阻止你，你向那些无理阻止的人质问，但你得到的答复却是被对方毒打，于是你举手作自卫，却被非法逮捕，又被无理控告，告你‘暴动’，你如何看待这个‘罪名’呢？”港英“法官”被这位青年的尖锐讽刺弄得目瞪口呆，无词以对。爱国银行的一位十八岁的女职员愤怒地质问港英的所谓“证人”：“暴动两字如何解释？”“证人”说他也不懂如何解释。再问：“我究竟怎样妨碍治安的？”“证人”又说不出。她便说：“我要质问你，你连‘暴动’和‘妨碍治安’的定义都说不出，怎能把这样的罪名用来控告人？”那个“证人”被质问得唇青脸白，手脚发抖。这位英勇的女职工斩钉截铁地说：“你们这些都是胡说八道，事实是我到‘总督府’去抗议……”不等她说完，“法官”就慌忙说什么“这是政治问题，与本案无关。”就此胡乱收场，算是“审”过了。
    港英那群所谓“法官”，既怯懦也凶残，打着虚伪的“民主”“自由”的遮羞布，干着罪恶的勾当。一位十八岁的爱国中学学生，遭受港英鹰犬严刑拷打，强迫他承认涂写标语的“罪名”。他在“法庭”上凛然拒绝认“罪”。“法官”无计可施，只好假惺惺地说“姑念”他年轻，宣“判”无罪释放，但又要他签字“约束行为”。这位中学生挺起胸膛，理直气壮地拒绝签字。他指出，他没有犯罪，何来签字“约束行为”？！“法官”见诡计败露，暴露了法西斯的狰狞面目，竟以“态度倔强”“不肯签字”等荒谬的“罪名”“判”这名学生入狱八个月。
    在“法庭”旁听的教师、学生和学生家长们眼看港英当局这种无耻行径，十分愤怒，当即指着“法官”严词抗议，“法官”被吓得惊惶失措，急忙“退庭”鼠窜。
    在七月十一日被港英法西斯当局绑架的新华社香港分社记者薛平，在敌人的“法庭”上，坚贞不屈，英勇顽强，对万恶的港英帝国主义进行了义正词严的审判，以无可辩驳的事实揭露了港英帝国主义的反华阴谋。与此同时，在七月十五日被港英法西斯当局非法逮捕的两名新华社香港分社记者陈凤英、陈德穆和五名爱国报纸记者，与二十一名同时被非法逮捕的爱国教育工作者一起，在敌人的“法庭”上结成一个英雄的整体，英勇地同敌人进行针锋相对的斗争。他们个个精神抖擞，斗志昂扬，以无比坚定的声音抗议港英法西斯当局对他们的非法逮捕和“审讯”。当一位六十二岁的爱国学校校长出“庭”时，他一字一句地说：“我抗议！我抗议！抗议你们非法逮捕、非法‘审讯’，并抗议在拘留期间对其他人的毒打。”他威武不可侵犯的神态，使“法庭”内的大小官吏不敢正视。
    我们无数英勇的反帝爱国战士，不愧为中华民族的优秀儿女，他们在敌人的监狱里，在敌人的“法庭”上，坚贞不屈，勇于斗争的英雄气概，大长了革命人民的志气，大灭了英帝威风。让英帝国主义在我们英勇的战士面前发抖吧！
