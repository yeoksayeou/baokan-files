The commander-in-chief of the British Far East Command, Carver, after his "inspection" of Hong Kong, declared: "If the situation continues to deteriorate, I can deploy various troops to garrison Hong Kong." What a big boast!

However, how much military strength does British imperialism really have? In the entire "area east of Suez," it has only about 70,000 to 80,000 troops. Even this meager force, it can hardly sustain.

Carver's superiors in London, it seems, did not bother to attend to this subordinate's boasting. At the same time, they issued a "Defense White Paper," effectively giving him a slap in the face. According to this "White Paper," Britain, in order to save overseas expenses, will have to reduce its troops in the Far East, and within a few years, there will be no "Commander-in-Chief of the Far East" at all.

After the Labour Party government came to power, in order to strengthen British imperialism's aggressive forces in the Far East, maintain its colonial interests in this region, and cooperate with U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war in Asia, it implemented the so-called "East of Suez" military policy. Until last year, Wilson was still shouting hoarsely that Britain must continue to maintain its strength in the Far East to play its "world role." Unfortunately, it was powerless, and foreign exchange reserves were increasingly depleted. This bankrupt household had to consider reducing overseas military expenditures. In this way, British imperialism completely revealed its paper tiger nature.

Of course, the publication of this "Defense White Paper" does not mean that British imperialism's appetite for aggression has diminished. It will still redeploy its military forces overseas, with the help of its American boss, make a desperate struggle, and fight to the end against the people of Asia. However, no matter what, the Labour Party government was forced to modify its so-called "East of Suez" policy, proving that British imperialism has indeed reached the point of sunset and gasping for breath, to the extent that the Conservative Party's "Daily Mail" could not help but lament: "The time of the setting of the British Empire has arrived."

At such a time, Carver's big talk sounds like the wheezing of a dying man.

### 牛皮一吹就破

    牛皮一吹就破
    英国远东军总司令卡弗在到香港“巡视”后，发表谈话说：假如局势继续加剧的话，
  “我可以增拨各种部队来驻守香港”。牛皮吹得真是不小！
    但是，英帝国主义在军事上到底有多少本钱呢？它在整个“苏伊士以东”的兵力，一共不过七、八万人。即便这区区的队伍，它都已经穷得维持不下去了。
    卡弗在伦敦的上司，看来没有顾得及他这个下属所吹的牛皮，不迟不早就在同一天发表了一份“国防白皮书”，无异给了他一巴掌。据这份“白皮书”宣布，英国为了节省海外开支，将不得不减少在远东的驻军，几年之内，什么“远东军总司令”也将根本不存在了。
    工党政府上台以后，为了加强英帝国主义在远东的侵略势力，维持它对这个地区殖民利益，并配合美帝国主义对亚洲的侵略政策和战争政策，推行所谓“苏伊士以东”军事政策。直到去年，威尔逊还在声嘶力竭地叫嚷英国要继续在远东保持力量，以发挥它的什么“世界作用”。无奈力不从心，外汇储备日益亏空，这个破落户不得不从削减海外军事开支方面打主意了。这样一来，英帝国主义就完全现出了它的纸老虎原形。
    当然，这个“国防白皮书”的发表，绝不意味着英帝国主义侵略的胃口缩小了。它还要重新部署在海外的军事力量，在美国大老板的帮衬下，进行垂死的挣扎，同亚洲人民为敌到底。但是，不管怎么样，工党政府被迫修改它的所谓“苏伊士以东”政策，证明英帝国主义确实已经到了日薄西山、气息奄奄的田地了，以至保守党的《每日邮报》禁不住感慨万千地发出绝望的悲叹：“大英帝国日落西山的时刻已经来临了”。
    在这样的时刻，卡弗的大话听起来不就象是一个垂死者喉咙中发出的痰喘声吗？
