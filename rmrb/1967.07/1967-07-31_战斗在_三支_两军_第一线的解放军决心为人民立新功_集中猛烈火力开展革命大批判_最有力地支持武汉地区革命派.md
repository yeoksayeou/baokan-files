PLA fighters on the frontlines of "Three Supports, Two Militaries" are determined to serve the people. They are concentrating their firepower to launch a revolutionary criticism campaign, providing the strongest support to the revolutionary masses in Wuhan.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 30th, PLA fighters on the frontlines of "Three Supports, Two Militaries" are resolutely supporting the proletarian revolutionary masses in Wuhan while launching a new wave of revolutionary criticism. With unprecedented intensity, they are attacking China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the military. They are determined to support the proletarian revolutionary masses in Wuhan through their actions in the revolutionary criticism campaign. The fighters firmly declare: We must unwaveringly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the struggle, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works, firmly implement the Party's policies, and grasp the direction of the struggle. We must more strongly support the proletarian revolutionary masses, raise the banner of revolutionary unity, strengthen unity, and jointly fight the enemy. We must help the proletarian revolutionary masses continuously summarize experiences and improve their fighting skills, better work with the deceived masses, and resolutely carry out the revolutionary criticism campaign to achieve a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution!

After a year of tempering in the Cultural Revolution, the fighters participating in "Three Supports, Two Militaries" have grown increasingly hateful towards China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the military, and their feelings for the proletarian revolutionary masses have deepened. The frenzied counterattacks by China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the military in Wuhan have further enraged the fighters. At grand meetings and discussions, the fighters unanimously declare: The frenzied counterattacks by a handful of class enemies are merely their death throes. The more evil deeds they commit, the more they expose themselves and accelerate their doom. We must more swiftly and effectively launch a new wave of revolutionary criticism to thoroughly bury the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the military. PLA fighters in Shanghai have, in recent days, joined proletarian revolutionary masses from factories, communes, offices, and schools in marches, rallies, and discussions to denounce the heinous crimes of the frenzied counterattacks by a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the military in Wuhan and their puppets in the "Million Heroes Corps" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. PLA fighters in the Shanghai Garrison participating in "Three Supports, Two Militaries" say: Anyone who dares to oppose Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, we will resolutely overthrow. The fighters of the 8250th Unit of the PLA, who are fighting shoulder to shoulder with the proletarian revolutionary masses, say that carrying out revolutionary criticism is the greatest politics and principle. Serving the people means achieving new merits in the criticism campaign. They say: Since we intervened in the local Cultural Revolution, we have remembered the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings that the PLA should actively support the broad leftist masses, held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, and firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We have clearly supported the revolutionary rebel factions like the "July 27th Commune" in Henan and the revolutionary great unity with the leftists as the core. Countless facts prove that to better support the proletarian revolutionary masses and carry out the revolutionary criticism campaign, we must achieve, consolidate, and develop the revolutionary great unity in the criticism campaign and continuously promote the revolutionary criticism campaign to a new level.

Fighters participating in "Three Supports, Two Militaries" have deeply realized through their struggle practices that unity is strength, and the better the revolutionary situation, the more the proletarian revolutionary masses must strengthen unity. They say, the class enemies have not been completely eliminated and are still struggling desperately. In the current new wave of revolutionary criticism, we must help the proletarian revolutionary masses unite better, concentrate firepower, and strike the enemy. PLA fighters in the Guizhou Military Region participating in "Three Supports, Two Militaries," who are heart to heart and shoulder to shoulder with the proletarian revolutionary masses, have, in recent days, held meetings and discussions in factories, rural areas, offices, and schools to denounce the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and a handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the military in Wuhan.

Fighters participating in "Three Supports, Two Militaries" are determined to further strengthen work with the deceived masses, helping them stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and join the revolutionary criticism campaign to fiercely fight against "a handful."

    战斗在“三支”“两军”第一线的解放军决心为人民立新功
    集中猛烈火力开展革命大批判
    最有力地支持武汉地区革命派
    据新华社三十日讯　战斗在“三支”、“两军”第一线的人民解放军广大指战员，在坚决支持武汉地区无产阶级革命派的同时，正在掀起一个更大规模的革命大批判的新高潮，以空前猛烈的火力，猛攻中国的赫鲁晓夫，猛攻党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，决心以搞好革命大批判的实际行动，最有力地支持武汉地区的无产阶级革命派。广大指战员们最坚决地表示：要坚定不移地贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，坚决贯彻党的政策，紧紧掌握斗争大方向；要更加有力地支持无产阶级革命派，高举革命的大联合的旗帜，加强团结，共同对敌，要更加有力地帮助无产阶级革命派不断总结经验，不断提高斗争艺术，更好地做受蒙蔽的群众的工作，坚决把革命的大批判搞得好上加好，夺取无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利！
    经过一年来无产阶级文化大革命斗争的锻炼，参加“三支”、“两军”工作的广大指战员，对中国的赫鲁晓夫，对党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，仇恨越来越大，对无产阶级革命派，感情越来越深。中国的赫鲁晓夫和武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的疯狂反扑，更激起了广大指战员的无比愤怒。在盛大集会上，在座谈讨论中，指战员们一致表示：一小撮阶级敌人的疯狂反扑，不过是垂死挣扎。他们做的坏事越多，就越充分暴露他们，就越加速他们的灭亡。我们一定要更迅速地、更好地掀起革命大批判的新高潮，彻底埋葬党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。解放军驻沪三军广大指战员，这几天，同工厂、公社、机关、学校的无产阶级革命派一起游行示威，集会座谈，愤怒声讨武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和被他们操纵的“百万雄师”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头疯狂反扑的滔天罪行。解放军上海警备区参加“三支”、“两军”工作的指战员们说：谁敢反对毛主席、反对林副主席，反对党中央，反对中央文革，我们就坚决把他打倒。紧紧同无产阶级革命派并肩战斗的人民解放军八二五○部队指战员说，开展革命的大批判，是最大的政治，最大的原则。为人民立功，就是要在大批判中立新功。他们说：自介入地方文化大革命以来，我们牢记伟大领袖毛主席关于人民解放军应该积极支持左派广大群众的教导，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，坚定不移地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，旗帜鲜明地支持河南“二七公社”等无产阶级革命造反派，支持以左派为核心的革命的大联合。无数事实证明，要更好地支持无产阶级革命派，要开展好革命的大批判，就必须在大批判中实现、巩固和发展革命的大联合，并以革命的大联合不断促进革命的大批判达到新的水平。
    参加“三支”、“两军”的广大指战员们，从自己的斗争实践中深刻认识到团结就是力量，革命形势越好，无产阶级革命派越要加强团结。他们说，阶级敌人没有最后灭亡，还在拚命挣扎，在当前的革命大批判的新高潮中，必须帮助无产阶级革命派更好地团结起来，集中火力，打击敌人。和无产阶级革命派心连心、肩并肩的贵州省军区参加“三支”、“两军”的广大指战员，连日来，在工厂、农村、机关、学校纷纷集会、座谈，愤怒声讨中国的赫鲁晓夫和武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行。
    参加“三支”、“两军”工作的指战员们，决心进一步加强做受蒙蔽群众的工作，帮助他们站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来，投入狠斗“一小撮”的革命大批判的战斗中去。
