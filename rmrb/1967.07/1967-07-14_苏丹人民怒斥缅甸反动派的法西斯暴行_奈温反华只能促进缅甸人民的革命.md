The Sudanese people strongly condemn the fascist atrocities committed by the Ne Win reactionary government of Burma against the Burmese Chinese and the diplomatic personnel of the Chinese Embassy in Burma.

The Executive Committee member of the Sudan-China Friendship Association, Muhammad Osman, told a New China News Agency correspondent in Khartoum: "The Ne Win clique's atrocities are like a man lifting a stone to drop on his own feet. No matter what the Ne Win clique does, it will not be able to destroy the good relations between the revolutionary peoples of the two countries, nor will it be able to suppress the struggle of the heroic Burmese people under the leadership of their Communist Party. The Ne Win clique is doomed to failure." He pointed out that the fascist crimes of the Ne Win clique are "an extension of the U.S. imperialist plot."

In his concluding remarks, he shouted: "Long live the struggle of the Burmese people! Long live the unity of all revolutionary peoples against U.S. imperialism and modern revisionism! Long live Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!"

A member of the Sudan-China Friendship Association, Saleh, said that the anti-China crimes committed by the Ne Win reactionary government will only strengthen the Burmese people's resolve to struggle. He pointed out that the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, who are behind the scenes supporting these actions, are very afraid of the Burmese revolutionary people who are waging armed struggle.

Student Adam said: "The anti-China provocations of the Ne Win government can only be a noose around its own neck, and can only promote the people to carry out a broader and more intense revolution."

    苏丹人民怒斥缅甸反动派的法西斯暴行
    奈温反华只能促进缅甸人民的革命
    据新华社喀土穆十一日电　苏丹人民强烈谴责缅甸奈温反动政府对缅甸华侨和中国驻缅甸大使馆的外交人员犯下的法西斯暴行。
    苏丹—中国友好协会执行委员会委员穆罕默德·奥斯曼在喀土穆向新华社记者发表谈话说：“奈温集团犯下这些暴行，就象一个人搬起石头打自己的脚一样。不管奈温集团怎样做，它决达不到破坏两国革命人民的良好关系的目的，它决不能把英雄的缅甸人民在他们的共产党领导下的斗争镇压下去。奈温集团必败。”他指出，奈温集团的法西斯罪行“是美帝国主义阴谋的延伸”。
    他在结束讲话时高呼：“缅甸人民的斗争万岁！”“一切革命人民反对美帝国主义和现代修正主义的团结万岁！”“马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想万岁！”
    苏丹—中国友好协会的成员萨利赫说，奈温反动政府犯下的反华罪行，只会增强缅甸人民进行斗争的决心。他指出，躲在幕后支持这些行径的美帝国主义和苏联修正主义，非常害怕正在展开武装斗争的缅甸革命人民。
    大学生阿达姆说：“奈温政府的反华挑衅行为只能是往自己脖子上套绞索，只能促进人民更广泛、更激烈地进行革命。”
