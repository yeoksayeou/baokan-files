	Chairman Hill of the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) recently published an article enthusiastically praising Chairman Mao's outstanding contributions to Marxism-Leninism. He pointed out that Chairman Mao has become the great leader of the world's people.

	The article said, "Mao Zedong Thought creatively developed every aspect of Marxism-Leninism. It has the deepest international significance. Mao Zedong truly inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism."

	The Australian newspaper *Vanguard* published Hill's article on the 20th. The article said that the Communist Party of China had just celebrated its 46th anniversary. On this occasion, the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) extends warm greetings to the Communist Party of China and its great leader, Chairman Mao Zedong. The article emphasized that it is necessary to understand the international significance of the history of the Communist Party of China. Without understanding the great significance of Mao Zedong Thought and its role in the history of the Chinese Party, it is impossible to understand this history.

	The article said, "Mao Zedong truly followed the teachings of Marx and Lenin. He understood that the living soul of Marxism is to analyze concrete conditions concretely. He combined the universal truths of Marxism with the specific realities of China. In doing so, he greatly enriched Marxism-Leninism and creatively developed it. This creative development and enrichment are not limited to China alone but have the deepest and broadest international significance. Under the influence of his thought, China achieved liberation in 1949, an event comparable to the October Revolution. Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, is shaking the world."

	The article said that Chairman Mao has written many great Marxist-Leninist classics. In the history of the Communist Party of China, Chairman Mao has consistently and resolutely fought against right opportunism and "left" opportunism. "He saw these problems and solved them correctly. What a great Marxist-Leninist he is!"

	The article went on to praise Chairman Mao's brilliant contributions to Marxism-Leninism in areas such as armed struggle and the dictatorship of the proletariat. The article pointed out that Chairman Mao's brilliant proposition that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" has caused imperialism and revisionism to panic. The article also praised Chairman Mao's brilliant work *On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People*, which pointed out the reality of the continued existence of classes and class struggle in socialist society.

	The article emphasized that Chairman Mao has made great contributions to the struggle against revisionism both internationally and within China. Chairman Mao has become the undisputed leader of the world's people.

	The article concluded, "Mao Zedong Thought creatively developed every aspect of Marxism-Leninism. It has the deepest international significance. The communiqué of the historic 11th Plenary Session of the 8th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China says: 'Mao Zedong Thought is Marxism-Leninism in the era of the comprehensive collapse of imperialism and the worldwide victory of socialism.' This is a statement of historical significance."

    希尔主席说毛主席真正继承、捍卫和发展了马列主义
    毛主席是世界人民的伟大领袖
    新华社墨尔本二十七日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）主席希尔最近发表文章热情赞扬毛主席对马克思列宁主义作出的杰出贡献，并指出，毛主席已成为世界人民的伟大领袖。
    文章说，“毛泽东思想创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的每一个方面。它具有最深刻的国际意义”，“毛泽东真正继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义”。
    澳大利亚《先锋报》二十日刊载了希尔的文章。文章说，中国共产党刚刚纪念过它的第四十六周年。在这四十六周年之际，澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）谨向中国共产党及其伟大领袖毛泽东主席热烈地致敬。文章强调说：了解中国共产党党史的国际意义，是很必要的。不了解毛泽东思想的伟大意义及其在中国党历史上的作用，就不可能了解这部历史。
    文章说：“毛泽东真正地遵循了马克思和列宁的教导。他认识到，马克思主义的活的灵魂，就是对于具体情况作具体的分析。他把马克思主义的普遍真理同中国的具体现实结合起来。他这样作，大大丰富了马克思列宁主义，并且创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义。这种创造性的发展和丰富不仅限于中国一国，而且具有最深刻最广泛的国际意义。在他的思想的影响下，中国于一九四九年获得了解放，这是可以同十月革命相比的重大事件。当前，在毛泽东思想指导下的（中国）无产阶级文化大革命，震动了全世界。”
    文章说，毛主席写了许多伟大的马列主义的经典著作。在中国共产党的历史上，毛主席一贯坚决同右倾机会主义和“左”倾机会主义进行斗争，他“看到了这些问题，并且正确地解决了这些问题，他是一位多么杰出的马克思列宁主义者呀！”
    文章接着赞扬了毛主席在武装斗争、无产阶级专政等方面对马克思列宁主义所作的光辉贡献。文章指出，毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”这一英明论断，使帝国主义和修正主义惊慌失措。文章还赞扬毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这一光辉论著中，指出了社会主义社会还继续存在阶级和阶级斗争的现实。
    文章强调指出，毛主席无论对国际上或是中国国内的反对修正主义的斗争都作出了巨大的贡献。毛主席已成为世界人民无可争辩的领袖。
    文章最后说，“毛泽东思想创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义的每一个方面。它具有最深刻的国际意义。中国共产党第八届中央委员会具有历史意义的第十一次全体会议的公报说：‘毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。’这是一个具有历史意义的声明。”
