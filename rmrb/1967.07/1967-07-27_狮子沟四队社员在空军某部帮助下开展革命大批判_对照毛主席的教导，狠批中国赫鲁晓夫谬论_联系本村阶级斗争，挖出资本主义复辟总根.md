The People's Liberation Army Air Force of the Beijing Military Region, in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions on the peasants of the commune that they should also criticize the bourgeoisie and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and in accordance with Comrade Lin Biao's directive on the unification of the thoughts of the entire Chinese people with Mao Zedong Thought, has armed the broad masses of commune members with Mao Zedong Thought in the course of supporting agriculture. They have raised high the banner of revolutionary criticism, carried out education on class struggle and the struggle between the two lines, and made the broad masses of commune members realize that China's Khrushchev is the sworn enemy of the poor and lower-middle peasants and the root cause of the restoration of capitalism. They have fully mobilized the commune members, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, using the bed and the field as the battlefield, and carrying out a thorough exposure and criticism of China's Khrushchev, to eliminate the poison left by China's Khrushchev in the countryside. The revolutionary criticism has powerfully promoted the thought revolution of the people and promoted agricultural production.

The more you discuss, the clearer you see, the more you discuss, the brighter your eyes become, and every bad thing comes from China's Khrushchev.

This spring, the propaganda team came to the Fourth Production Brigade of Lion Valley Commune in Chongli County, Hebei Province. They took the task of propagating Mao Zedong Thought, arming all the commune members with Mao Zedong Thought, and establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought as the fundamental task of supporting agriculture.

The publication of Comrade Chen Boda's article "Patriotism or Treason?" sounded the bugle for a general offensive against China's Khrushchev. The propaganda team, together with the broad masses of commune members, carried out several exposures and criticisms of China's Khrushchev. However, after a few meetings, some commune members thought that the criticism was almost over. Some said, "China's Khrushchev is so far away from us, his poison cannot flow into our small valley, there is no need to expend so much effort." Others said, "The revolutionary masses have already exposed China's Khrushchev, and now the loudspeakers are broadcasting news of the criticism of China's Khrushchev every day. He has already been criticized and denounced."

In response to these living thoughts, the propaganda team and the commune members studied Chairman Mao's teachings repeatedly: "The enemy will not disappear by itself. Whether it is the reactionaries in China or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage by themselves." The propaganda team and the commune members discussed together: Has the poison of China's Khrushchev really flowed into our valley? Has his poison been eliminated? In the discussion, they closely linked the actual class struggle in the local area, contrasted China's Khrushchev's reactionary words and deeds, and exposed and discussed the situation of class struggle over the past seventeen years since liberation. They focused on discussing several issues: After a few years of liberation, the phenomenon of buying and selling land appeared in our Lion Valley, and two extremes were produced. Why? During the period of agricultural cooperation, a black wind suddenly blew, trying to cut down the cooperatives and force the poor and lower-middle peasants to retreat. Who was behind this? After the establishment of the commune, during the temporary difficulties of three consecutive years of natural disasters in our country, what kind of "three autonomies and one contract" trick appeared? Where did this come from?

The propaganda team and the masses of commune members discussed the problems together, studied Chairman Mao's works, and contrasted them with China's Khrushchev's reactionary words and deeds. The more they discussed, the clearer their minds became, and the more they discussed, the brighter their eyes became. The commune members clearly knew: these bad things, one by one, one after another, the root cause was China's Khrushchev. His purpose was to restore capitalism. If we do not thoroughly criticize and denounce him now, once he comes back to power, we poor and lower-middle peasants will suffer again, and millions of people will lose their heads.

Everyone also studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the nature of the reactionaries, which will not change, and used a large number of facts to prove that a fallen evil dog cannot change its biting nature. China's Khrushchev is like a large green onion hanging on the wall, with yellow leaves and withered roots but a living heart. He is always looking for opportunities to counterattack and dreams of coming back to power. Commune member Wang Yuezhi recalled the painful life before liberation and angrily said: "The big and small Khrushchevs in China are like the wolves on our mountain, they cannot change their nature of eating people. You may see him tucking his tail now, but that's just an act. If we don't thoroughly defeat him, he will eat many of us as soon as he gets the chance. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: 'Do not pity the snake-like evil people.' We poor and lower-middle peasants must not be soft-hearted or soft-handed towards the big and small Khrushchevs in China. We must thoroughly criticize and denounce them, so that they will never be able to rise again."

Through such criticism, the masses of commune members suddenly realized: "The poison of China's Khrushchev still has a deep influence in our valley! His poison is like the wild grass on the mountain, it is not easy to eradicate without great effort!"

Eliminate one poison, settle one account of sin, and dig out one root of poison of China's Khrushchev in the countryside.

The propaganda team members firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses." They used Chairman Mao's works as weapons, using the field and the bed, after dinner, and on rainy days, to organize the commune members to deeply criticize China's Khrushchev. Each meeting, they selected one aspect of Chairman Mao's sayings to learn, and criticized one fallacy of China's Khrushchev. The commune members said: "After studying Chairman Mao's teachings, we stand higher and see farther, and we have the strongest ideological weapon to criticize China's Khrushchev; using Chairman Mao's words to shine a light on China's Khrushchev's words and deeds, China's Khrushchev reveals his true colors and exposes his reactionary essence; eliminating one poison, settling one account of sin, and digging out one root of poison of China's Khrushchev in the agricultural front, our thoughts have also been elevated."

At the criticism meeting, they studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "In the peasant masses, for thousands of years, it has been individual economy, one family one household is a production unit, this scattered individual production is the economic basis of feudal rule, and it makes the peasants themselves fall into eternal poverty. The only way to overcome this situation is to gradually collectivize; and the only way to achieve collectivization, according to Lenin, is to go through cooperation." "Apart from socialism, there is no other way out."

But China's Khrushchev actively promoted the capitalist way, advocating "four freedoms" and "three autonomies and one contract," and spreading the wind of individual farming; promoting "contracting production to the household" and "distributing land to the team," and even saying that "the emergence of some bourgeois elements is not to be feared, do not be afraid of the spread of capitalism," and so on, attempting to restore capitalism. At the criticism meeting, the female commune member and Communist Party member Wang Yuezhi, who came from a poor peasant family, said angrily: "Chairman Mao's every word calls on us to take the road of collectivization and the bright road of socialism; but China's Khrushchev wants us to take the lonely path of individual farming. He also took advantage of the difficulties of the three years of natural disasters in our country to promote the three 'autonomies' and one 'contract,' making people pursue private interests and not collective interests. The agent of China's Khrushchev in our county also followed suit, advocating 'if you don't want to eat chaff, open up a small piece of wasteland' and saying 'the collective sheep divided to the household to raise, will not produce capitalism; more sheep means more meat, more fur, and more fertilizer.' In this way, many people's thoughts were led to opening up small pieces of wasteland, managing private plots, raising sheep, and engaging in sideline production, making the commune members 'work hard on both ends and pant in the middle.' They worked hard in the small pieces of wasteland, private plots, and sideline production in the morning and evening, and put collective production aside. This is not tearing down the stage of socialism, but forcibly dragging us onto the road of capitalism, intending to make us suffer again?"

In the great criticism, the propaganda team and the masses of commune members studied Chairman Mao's instructions on class education together, recalled the family history, brigade history, and history of cooperation, and used their own personal experiences to criticize China's Khrushchev's fallacies of "hiring labor is not exploitation, it increases social wealth" and "the working people are not against exploitation, but welcome exploitation." The female team leader from a poor peasant family, Ren Xirong, angrily denounced: "China's Khrushchev says that the working people are not against exploitation, but welcome exploitation, truly what kind of vine produces what kind of melon, what kind of class speaks what kind of words. In the evil old society, my whole family of seven people had no house to live in, no land to till, and we could not fill our stomachs with chaff and vegetables all year round, and we had never worn a complete piece of clothing, but those black-hearted landlords, relying on the exploitation of the poor, ate like fat pigs, with oil dripping from their mouths. China's Khrushchev desperately advocates 'welcoming exploitation,' intending to push us back into the mud of the old society, to be their slaves again. This, we will never agree to!"

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, through the great criticism, peeled off the layer upon layer of makeup of China's Khrushchev, and saw more clearly that he is the sworn enemy of the whole people. Many commune members said: "To uproot a tree, you must first uproot the root. If we do not overthrow China's Khrushchev, the bitter root of us poor and lower-middle peasants will not be pulled out."

Sweep out the private thoughts, let the public thoughts settle in, the thoughts of the commune members are revolutionized, and production presents a new situation.

Through the great criticism, the masses of Brigade Four and the propaganda team members all realized that in the past, they were influenced by the poison of China's Khrushchev because they had the thought of "seeking private interests" in their minds. Only by constantly breaking private thoughts and establishing public thoughts, and letting Mao Zedong Thought take root in their minds, can they resist the infiltration of bourgeois thoughts and not be deceived by China's Khrushchev. With their awareness raised, they more consciously raised the thought revolution to the height of the struggle between the two lines, and combined the ideological struggle in their minds with the struggle between the two lines, launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They studied Chairman Mao's works with the great affairs of the state and the class in mind, broke down private thoughts and established public thoughts, and carried out a revolution in the depths of their souls. The whole brigade, old and young, men and women, all studied the "Three Constantly Read Articles," used the "Three Constantly Read Articles," and spoke about the "Three Constantly Read Articles." The commune members said: "Chairman Mao's shining 'Three Constantly Read Articles' teach us to devote ourselves to the collective, to be selfless and to serve the public; China's Khrushchev, however, wants us to be selfish and to serve the private. We must use the public to overcome the private, study the 'Three Constantly Read Articles' for life, sweep out the private thoughts, and let the public thoughts settle in. Let the private thoughts become like China's Khrushchev, a rat crossing the street, everyone shouts to beat it, and stink for a thousand years!"

The revolutionary criticism has promoted the thought revolution of the people, and production has quickly presented a new situation. At present, all the commune members and cadres of the brigade are full of enthusiasm, and the attendance rate is unprecedentedly high. The crops in the fields are growing well. The commune members happily said: "This is the first time we have seen such good crops." They are determined to carry out the great criticism in depth while doing a good job in production, and to achieve a great harvest in agriculture to give a heavy blow to China's Khrushchev.

    狮子沟四队社员在空军某部帮助下开展革命大批判
    对照毛主席的教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫谬论
    联系本村阶级斗争，挖出资本主义复辟总根
    本报讯　中国人民解放军北京部队空军某部毛泽东思想宣传队，遵循毛主席关于公社农民“也要批判资产阶级”，“要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，和林副主席关于用毛泽东思想统一全国人民的思想的指示，在支农中用毛泽东思想武装广大社员群众的头脑，高举革命的批判旗帜，大抓阶级斗争和两条路线斗争的教育，使广大社员群众认识到中国的赫鲁晓夫是贫下中农的死对头，是复辟资本主义的总祸根，把千仇万恨集中到中国的赫鲁晓夫身上。他们充分发动社员群众，以毛泽东思想为武器，以炕头、地头作战场，深入开展对中国的赫鲁晓夫的大揭发、大批判，肃清中国的赫鲁晓夫在农村的流毒。革命的大批判，有力地促进了人的思想革命化，推动了农业生产。
    越摆心里越明，越议眼睛越亮，一桩桩坏事都来自中国赫鲁晓夫
    今年春季，宣传队来到了河北省崇礼县狮子沟公社狮子沟第四生产队。他们把宣传毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装全体社员的头脑，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，作为支农的根本任务。
    戚本禹同志的《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》文章的发表，吹响了向中国的赫鲁晓夫发起总攻击的进军号。宣传队同广大社员群众一起，对中国的赫鲁晓夫进行了几次揭发、批判。但是，开过几次会后，有些社员认为批判得差不多了。有的说：“中国的赫鲁晓夫离咱这么远，他的流毒流不到咱小山沟里，用不着费这么大的劲。”有的说：“革命群众早就把中国的赫鲁晓夫揪出来了，现在广播喇叭里天天传来对中国的赫鲁晓夫进行批判的消息。他已经被批倒批臭了。”针对这些活思想，宣传队的同志和社员一起反复学习了毛主席的教导：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”宣传队和社员一起讨论：到底中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒流到咱们山沟来没有？他的流毒肃清了没有？在讨论中，他们紧紧联系当地阶级斗争的实际，对照中国赫鲁晓夫的反动言行，大揭大摆解放十七年来阶级斗争的情况。大家集中讨论了这样几个问题：在解放以后不几年，在我们狮子沟就出现了买卖土地的现象，产生了两极分化，这是为什么？农业合作化时期，忽然刮来一股黑风，要大砍合作社，硬逼贫下中农走回头路，这又是谁搞的鬼？公社化以后，在我国遇到连续三年自然灾害的暂时困难时期，出现了什么“三自一包”的鬼花样，这又是从哪里来的？
    宣传队的同志和社员群众一起摆问题，一起讨论，一边学习毛主席著作，一边和中国的赫鲁晓夫的反动言行对照。越摆心里越明，越讨论眼睛越亮。社员们清楚地知道：这些坏事一件件，一桩桩，总祸根就是中国的赫鲁晓夫。他的目的就是想复辟资本主义。如果我们现在不把他彻底批倒斗臭，一旦他重新上台，我们贫下中农就得吃二遍苦，千百万人就会人头落地。
    大家又学习了毛主席关于反动派的本性是不会改变的教导，用大量的事实说明，落水的恶狗，改不了咬人的本性。中国的赫鲁晓夫好象挂在墙上的大葱，叶黄根枯心不死，他每时每刻都在找机会反扑，梦想重新上台。社员王月枝回忆了解放前的痛苦生活之后，愤怒地说：“中国大大小小的赫鲁晓夫，象俺们后山上的狼一样，改不了吃人的本性，你别看他现在夹起尾巴啦，那是装蒜。要不把他彻底打倒，他一得机会就要吃我们好多人。我们一定要牢记毛主席他老人家的教导：‘决不怜惜蛇一样的恶人’。咱们贫下中农对中国大大小小的赫鲁晓夫决不能心软、手软，一定要狠狠地把他们批倒批臭，让他们永世不得翻身。”
    通过这样的批判，社员群众恍然大悟说：“中国的赫鲁晓夫的流毒在咱们山沟里的影响还很深呢！他的流毒就象山上的野草，不狠下功夫就不容易除根哪！”
    肃清一股流毒，算清一笔罪行，就挖掉中国赫鲁晓夫在农村的一条毒根
    宣传队的同志牢记毛主席的教导：“革命战争是群众的战争”。他们以毛主席著作为武器，利用地头、炕头，晚饭后、阴雨天，组织社员深入地批判中国的赫鲁晓夫。每次会，选学毛主席一个方面的语录，批判中国的赫鲁晓夫的一个谬论。社员们说：“学习了毛主席的教导，站得高，看得远，批判中国的赫鲁晓夫就有了最强大的思想武器；用毛主席的话去照一照中国赫鲁晓夫的言行，中国的赫鲁晓夫就现了原形，露出了反动本质；肃清一股流毒，算清一笔罪恶账，就挖掉中国赫鲁晓夫在农业战线上的一条毒根，我们的思想也提高了一步。”
    在批判会上，他们学习了毛主席的教导：“在农民群众方面，几千年来都是个体经济，一家一户就是一个生产单位，这种分散的个体生产，就是封建统治的经济基础，而使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦。克服这种状况的唯一办法，就是逐渐地集体化；而达到集体化的唯一道路，依据列宁所说，就是经过合作化。”“除了社会主义，再无别的出路。”
    可是中国的赫鲁晓夫却积极推行资本主义那一套，鼓吹什么“四大自由”、“三自一包”，大刮单干风；推行什么“包产到户”、“分田到组”，还胡说什么“产生一些资产阶级分子并不可怕，不要怕资本主义泛滥”，等等，妄图复辟资本主义。在批判会上，贫农出身的女社员、共产党员王月枝气愤地说：“毛主席句句话号召我们走集体化的道路，走社会主义光明大道；可是中国的赫鲁晓夫偏要我们走单干的独木小桥。他还乘我国遇到三年自然灾害的困难时期，搞什么三个‘自’、一个‘包’，让人们都谋私利，不谋集体。中国的赫鲁晓夫在我们县里的代理人也紧跟着?喝什么‘要想不吃糠，多开小片荒’；还说什么‘集体的羊分到户去养，出不了资本主义；羊多了反正是吃肉、穿皮、积了肥’。就这样把好多人的心思都引到开小片荒、搞自留地、喂羊搞副业上去了，弄得社员‘两头加劲，中间喘气’，早晨晚上在小片荒、自留地和副业上拚命地干，把集体生产撂到了一边。这不是拆社会主义的台，硬把我们往资本主义道上拖，存心让我们吃二遍苦吗？”
    在大批判中，宣传队的同志和社员群众一起学习毛主席关于阶级教育的指示，回忆了家史、队史、合作化史，用自己的亲身经历，批判中国的赫鲁晓夫的“雇人劳动不叫剥削，它增加了社会财富”、“劳动人民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削”等反动谬论。贫农出身的妇女队长任喜荣愤怒地控诉说：“中国的赫鲁晓夫说劳动人民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削，真是什么藤结什么瓜，什么阶级说什么话。在万恶的旧社会，俺全家七口人，房无一间，地无一垄，一年到头糠菜填不饱肚子，没有穿过一件囫囵衣裳，可那些黑心的地主老财，靠着剥削穷人，吃得肥猪一样，满嘴流油。中国的赫鲁晓夫拚命地?喝‘欢迎剥削’，这是想把我们重新推到旧社会的泥坑里去，再替他们做牛做马做奴隶。这，我们一万个不答应！”
    广大贫下中农在大批判中剥掉了中国的赫鲁晓夫的层层画皮，更加看清了他是全国人民的死对头。许多社员说：“刨树先刨根，不打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫，咱们贫下中农的苦根就拔不掉。”
    私字扫地出门，公字安家落户，社员思想革命化，生产出现新气象
    通过大批判，四队的社员群众和宣传队的同志们都认识到，以前受中国的赫鲁晓夫流毒的影响，是因为自己头脑里有“谋私利”的思想。只有不断破私立公，让毛泽东思想在自己头脑里扎根，才能抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀，才不会上中国的赫鲁晓夫的当。认识提高了，他们更自觉地把思想革命化提高到两条路线斗争的高度来对待，把头脑中的思想斗争同两条路线的斗争紧紧结合起来，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。他们带着国家的大事、阶级的大事活学活用毛主席著作，大破私字，大立公字，在灵魂深处闹革命。全队男女老少都大学“老三篇”，大用“老三篇”，大讲“老三篇”。社员们说：“毛主席红光闪闪的‘老三篇’，教导我们要一心为集体，毫不利己，一切为公；中国的赫鲁晓夫却要我们专门利己，一切为私，‘吃小亏占大便宜’。我们一定以公克私，学一辈子‘老三篇’，把私字扫地出门，让公字安家落户。让私字变得和中国赫鲁晓夫一样，老鼠过街，人人喊打，遗臭万年！”
    革命的大批判，促进了人的思想革命化，生产也很快地出现了新的面貌。目前，全队社员和干部，干劲很足，出勤率空前提高，田间禾苗长势很好。社员们高兴地说：“头一次见这么好的庄稼。”他们决心在深入展开大批判的同时搞好生产，以农业的大丰收，狠狠痛击中国的赫鲁晓夫。
