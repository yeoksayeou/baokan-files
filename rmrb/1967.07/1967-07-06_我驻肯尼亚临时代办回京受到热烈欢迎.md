Our Chargé d'Affaires in Kenya, Li Jie, returned to the capital Beijing today and was warmly welcomed by relevant officials and hundreds of representatives of the proletarian revolutionary masses. Comrade Li Jie was declared a "persona non grata" by the Kenyan government and was forced to leave Kenya and return to his homeland.

Comrade Li Jie, holding high a portrait of Chairman Mao and shouting "Long live Chairman Mao!", stepped off the plane. Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Xu Yixin, Vice Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee Zhou Yiping, Assistant Minister of Foreign Trade Liu Xiweng, and our Ambassador to Kenya Wang Yutian, among others, came forward to shake hands warmly with Comrade Li Jie, welcoming his victorious return. Representatives of the proletarian revolutionary masses presented Comrade Li Jie with a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and Mao badges. Comrade Li Jie and the representatives of the proletarian revolutionary masses together studied Chairman Mao's quotations: "All the world's people should unite as one, defeat the American aggressors and all their lackeys! All the world's people must have courage, dare to fight, not be afraid of difficulties and press on. Then, the whole world will definitely belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be routed."

Comrade Li Jie came to the welcoming crowd and, together with everyone, waved copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted: "Down with American imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with all reactionaries! Those who oppose China will meet a bad end!" The revolutionary masses expressed great indignation and strong protest against the Kenyan government's actions, which, in accordance with the needs of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism, deliberately sabotaged the relations between China and Kenya, damaged the friendship between the peoples of China and Kenya, and harmed the cause of unity and anti-imperialism among Asian and African peoples.

　　我驻肯尼亚临时代办回京受到热烈欢迎
    新华社五日讯　我国驻肯尼亚大使馆临时代办李颉，今天回到祖国首都北京，受到我国有关方面负责人和无产阶级革命派代表数百人的热烈欢迎。李颉同志是被肯尼亚政府无理宣布为“不受欢迎的人”而离开肯尼亚回国的。
    李颉同志高举毛主席像，高呼：“毛主席万岁！”走下飞机。外交部副部长徐以新，对外文委副主任周一萍，对外贸易部部长助理刘希文和我国驻肯尼亚大使王雨田等，迎上前去和李颉同志热烈握手，欢迎他胜利归来。无产阶级革命派代表向李颉同志赠送了《毛主席语录》和毛主席像章。李颉同志和无产阶级革命派代表一起学习了毛主席语录：“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    李颉同志来到欢迎的群众面前，和大家一起挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》高呼：“打倒美帝！打倒苏修！打倒一切反动派！”“反华的人绝没有好下场！”革命群众对肯尼亚政府适应美帝、苏修的需要，蓄意破坏中肯两国关系，破坏中肯两国人民友谊，损害亚非人民团结反帝事业的罪行，表示了极大愤慨和强烈抗议。
