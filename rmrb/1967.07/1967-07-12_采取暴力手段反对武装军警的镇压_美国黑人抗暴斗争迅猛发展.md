The violent resistance of Black Americans has rapidly developed in recent times. Since early June, fifteen major and medium-sized cities in the United States have successively erupted in large-scale violent self-defense struggles by Black people. Despite the Johnson administration mobilizing large numbers of military police for violent suppression, Black Americans remain undaunted in the face of counter-revolutionary violence, adopting various means to engage in head-to-head struggles. This situation has caused alarm and unease among the American ruling class. When discussing the violent resistance of Black Americans, President Johnson exclaimed that the situation must be kept "at the lowest level."

Since the summer of this year, the flames of violent resistance by Black Americans have burned more fiercely.

In early June, more than a thousand Black people in the eastern city of Boston engaged in three days of violent resistance, using stones, bricks, and bottles as weapons to fight fiercely with the police who came to suppress them. Some armed Black people also retaliated against the police.

In mid-June, Black residents in Tampa, the second-largest city in the southern state of Florida, launched a fierce violent resistance to protest the police killing of an innocent Black youth. They not only set fire to some white-owned stores that had long exploited Black people, but also seized a large number of weapons from a gun store and fought back against the police throughout the night. According to the Associated Press, the reactionary governor of the state, Kirk, was "woken from his sleep" in the middle of the night, flew to the scene, and mobilized five hundred fully armed National Guards to surround the Black residential areas of Tampa, intensifying the violent suppression. However, the Black people adopted a "hit-and-run" tactic, launching sudden attacks, causing the reactionary military police to repeatedly miss their targets and run around in exhaustion.

In Prattville, Alabama, Black residents, protesting the arrest of Black leader Carmichael by the reactionary authorities, clashed violently with the police. They had engaged in five hours of shooting against the two hundred National Guards sent by reactionary Governor Wallace to suppress them.

Additionally, in Cincinnati, Ohio, Newark, New Jersey, Chicago, Lansing, Michigan, Buffalo, New York, Atlanta, Georgia, and the Watts area of Los Angeles, Black residents' violent self-defense struggles have also seen new developments.

It is noteworthy that the violent resistance of Black Americans is no longer just a general opposition to white racial discrimination but has a clear political nature of opposing class and national oppression. The broad masses of Black people in the struggle have directed their attacks at the American ruling class. Their current slogans are: "Use all necessary means to achieve complete liberation," and "Eliminate the oppressors—the main oppressors are Johnson."

The Johnson administration's savage suppression of Black people has made Black Americans increasingly aware that they cannot harbor any illusions about the so-called "Civil Rights Act" played by the American ruling class, but must fight for their own liberation through the revolutionary path of opposing counter-revolutionary violence with revolutionary violence. They are rapidly shedding the long-standing "non-violent" ideology propagated by the American ruling class's puppet Black "leaders" and adopting violent forms to engage in head-to-head struggles with the American ruling class. A leader of the Black masses, Carmichael, recently pointed out in a conversation, "There is no need to go to Vietnam to shoot at the enemy as told by a white leader. We will shoot at the police who are killing our Black brothers in our own country."

At the same time, the awakening of Black Americans is also reflected in the fact that their violent resistance is gradually developing from spontaneous, scattered, and isolated actions to conscious, organized, and mutually supportive combat actions. Black residents in many places have established violent self-defense combat organizations. What is particularly important is that some Black organizations are striving to learn Chairman Mao's teachings on class struggle and violent revolution, beginning to use Mao Zedong Thought to guide their struggles. The head of the American government's secret service, FBI Director Hoover, recently admitted in alarm, "Some American Black organizations are 'under the guidance of Communist thought' and 'advocate guerrilla warfare to achieve their goals,' and want to 'overthrow the American capitalist system by violence.'"

To extinguish the flames of violent resistance by Black Americans, the Johnson administration, in addition to continuing violent suppression, is also intensifying deception, division, and bribery tactics. On the one hand, it organizes white "anti-riot squads" in Black residential areas and arbitrarily arrests Black community leaders who are firmly resisting; on the other hand, it is plotting so-called "welfare projects" to solve the employment problems of some Black youth; at the same time, it directs figures like Martin Luther King Jr. to strengthen control over the Black movement, scheming to sabotage and disintegrate the Black struggle from within.

However, Chairman Mao has said: "The rapid development of the Black struggle in America is a manifestation of the increasingly sharpened class struggle and national struggle within the United States." This struggle is not something that any of Johnson's government's conspiracies can suppress. The two million Black masses in America no longer want to continue to endure being oppressed and enslaved. They are awakening, fighting, and showing their strength in the fight. They are advancing towards the goal of liberation, and their struggle will surely achieve final victory! (Accompanying picture)

### 采取暴力手段反对武装军警的镇压  美国黑人抗暴斗争迅猛发展

    采取暴力手段反对武装军警的镇压
    美国黑人抗暴斗争迅猛发展
    美国黑人的抗暴斗争，最近有了迅猛的发展。从六月初以来，美国已有十五个大中城市先后爆发了大规模的黑人暴力自卫斗争。尽管约翰逊政府调集大批军警进行武力镇压，但是美国黑人在反革命的暴力面前，英勇不屈，采取各种方式进行了针锋相对的斗争。这种形势，已经引起了美国统治集团的惊慌不安。美国总统约翰逊在谈到美国黑人抗暴斗争时，惊呼要把事态的发展“保持在最低限度”。
    今年进入夏季以来，美国黑人抗暴斗争的烈火就越燃越旺。
    六月初，美国东部城市波士顿的一千多名黑人，在接连三天的抗暴斗争中，用石块、砖头和瓶子作武器，同前来镇压的警察进行激烈的搏斗，其中一些带枪的黑人还向警察进行还击。
    六月中旬，美国南部佛罗里达州第二大城市坦帕市的黑人群众，为了抗议警察杀害一名无辜黑人青年的罪行，展开了猛烈的抗暴斗争。他们不但放火烧毁了一些平时残酷剥削黑人的白人商店，而且从一家出售枪枝的商店夺取大批武器，对警察进行了通宵的反击。据美联社报道，这个州的反动州长柯克在深夜“从睡梦中被叫醒”，乘飞机赶往出事地点，并调动五百名全副武装的国民警卫队包围坦帕市的黑人聚居区，加紧武力镇压。但是黑人采取“打了就跑”的战术，进行突然袭击，使反动军警不断扑空，疲于奔命。
    在亚拉巴马州的普拉特维尔市，黑人群众由于抗议反动当局逮捕黑人领袖卡迈克尔，同警察发生了激烈的冲突。他们曾对反动州长华莱士派去镇压的二百名国民警卫队进行了五个小时的射击。
    另外，在俄亥俄州的辛辛那提市，新泽西州的纽瓦克、芝加哥，密执安州的兰辛市，纽约州的布法罗市，乔治亚州的亚特兰大市和西海岸洛杉矶市黑人聚居的瓦茨区，黑人群众的暴力自卫斗争也有了新的发展。
    值得注意的是，美国黑人的抗暴斗争，已经不仅仅是为了一般地反对白人的种族歧视，而是具有反对阶级压迫和民族压迫的明显的政治性质。广大黑人群众在斗争中把斗争的锋芒指向美国统治集团。他们现在提出的口号是：“用一切必要的手段争取完全解放”，“消灭压迫者——主要的压迫者是约翰逊”。
    约翰逊政府对黑人的野蛮镇压，使得美国黑人越来越认识到，他们决不能对美国统治集团玩弄的所谓“民权法案”的把戏抱有任何幻想，而必须通过以革命的暴力反对反革命暴力的斗争道路，来争取自身的解放。他们正在迅速摆脱美国统治集团御用的黑人“领袖”长期以来所宣扬的“非暴力主义”的束缚，采取暴力的形式来同美国统治集团展开针锋相对的斗争。美国黑人群众的一位领导人卡迈克尔在不久以前的一次谈话中曾经明白地指出，“用不着到越南去向一个白人头目所说的敌人开枪。我们将要向那些正在本国枪杀我们黑人兄弟的警察开枪。”
    同时，美国黑人的觉醒还表现在，他们的抗暴斗争正在从自发的、分散的、孤立的，逐渐发展成为自觉的有组织的互相支援的战斗行动。许多地方的黑人群众，已经建立了暴力自卫的战斗组织。特别重要的是，有些黑人群众组织，正在努力学习毛主席关于阶级斗争和暴力革命的学说，开始用毛泽东思想来指导自己的斗争。美国政府的特务头子、联邦调查局局长胡佛不久前惊慌地承认，有的美国黑人组织，是“在中共思想指导下”“主张进行游击战来达到它的目的”，而且要“用暴力来推翻美国资本主义制度”。
    为了扑灭美国黑人抗暴斗争的烈火，约翰逊政府除了继续进行武力镇压以外，还在加紧玩弄欺骗分化和收买的手段。它一方面在黑人聚居的地区组织白人的“防暴队”，无理逮捕坚决斗争的黑人群众领袖，一方面又在策划搞一些所谓“福利事业”，解决一部分黑人青年的就业问题；同时，还指使象马丁·路德·金牧师这样的所谓“黑人领袖”，加强对黑人运动的控制，阴谋从内部来破坏和瓦解黑人的斗争。
    但是，毛主席说过：“美国黑人斗争的迅速发展是美国国内阶级斗争和民族斗争日益尖锐化的表现”。这个斗争，决不是约翰逊政府的任何阴谋诡计所能遏制的。美国两千万黑人群众，再也不愿意继续忍受被压迫被奴役的状况了。他们正在觉醒起来，进行战斗，并且在战斗中表现出自己的力量。他们正在朝着解放的目标前进，他们的斗争一定会取得最后的胜利！（附图片）
