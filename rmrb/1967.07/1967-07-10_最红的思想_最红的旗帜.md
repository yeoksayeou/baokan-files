A unit's "Red Rebel Corps" needed to make a flag. They remembered Chairman Mao's teaching of "frugality for revolution" and decided not to spend a single penny or a single inch of cloth from the state. They found an old piece of red silk, cut and sewed it together, and made a red flag. Without a flagpole, they found a mosquito net pole to use instead. They proudly carried this red flag to meetings, parades, and great debates. Some people said they were "embarrassing," others laughed at them for being "stingy," and some advised them to make a new flag. They remained unmoved and firmly replied: "Revolution is not about having a new 'signboard.' Our flag made from old silk embodies the reddest thought of 'frugality for revolution.'"

"Revolution is not about having a new 'signboard.' Our flag made from old silk embodies the reddest thought of 'frugality for revolution.'" What a resounding revolutionary statement! What a shining revolutionary thought!

The attitude towards a flag made from old silk reflects the struggle between two worldviews. Those with bourgeois thoughts either say the flag is "embarrassing" or laugh at it for being "stingy." But true proletarian revolutionaries feel proud and honored. Because the flag that embodies the reddest thought of 'frugality for revolution' is the reddest flag of the proletariat.

Proletarian revolutionaries often say: "Our heads can be cut off, our blood can flow, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned!" "Frugality for revolution" is Chairman Mao's great call. We must keep it in our minds, remember it in our hearts, and put it into action. We must never "abandon" it!

If we abandon the great thought of "frugality for revolution," we will go astray. This is not just an economic issue; it is first and foremost a political issue. It concerns where the proletarian revolutionaries will go after taking power, the nature of our power, and whether we can carry the revolution to the end. We must never take this lightly.

Proletarian revolutionaries must always remember that no matter how our status or conditions change, the thought and style of "frugality for revolution" must never change.

### 最红的思想　最红的旗帜

　　最红的思想　最红的旗帜
    一个单位的“红色造反队”，需要做一面队旗，他们牢记毛主席的“要节约闹革命”的教导，决不轻易动用国家一分钱、一寸布。他们找来了一块用旧了的红绸子，裁裁剪剪，拼拼凑凑，做成了一面红旗。没有旗杆，又找了一根蚊帐杆代替。他们就扛着这面红旗昂首阔步地开会、游行、参加大辩论。有人说他们“丢人”，有人笑他们“小气”，有人劝他们另做队旗。他们都不为所动，坚决地回答说：革命不看“招牌”新，我们这面用旧绸子做的红旗就体现了“要节约闹革命”的最红思想。
      “革命不看‘招牌’新，我们这面用旧绸子做的红旗就体现了‘要节约闹革命’的最红思想。”这是多么响当当的革命语言，这是多么光闪闪的革命思想。
    对一面用旧绸子制作的旗子的态度，反映了两种世界观的斗争。有资产阶级思想的人，不是说这面旗子“丢人”，就是笑这面旗子“小气”。可是，真正的无产阶级革命派，却为此而觉得自豪，感到荣耀。因为，体现了“要节约闹革命”的最红思想的旗子，就是无产阶级最红的旗帜。
    无产阶级革命派常常说：“头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想不可丢！”“要节约闹革命”就是毛主席的伟大号召，我们就是要传在口中，记在心中，见诸于行动中，千万“不可丢”啊！
    丢了“要节约闹革命”这个伟大思想，我们就会走上邪路，这决不是个经济问题，首先是个政治问题。它关系我们无产阶级革命派掌权以后向何处去的问题，关系我们政权性质的问题，这也是能不能将革命进行到底的问题，切切不可等闲视之。
    无产阶级革命派应该牢牢记住，不管地位怎样变，条件怎样变，“要节约闹革命”的思想作风永远不能变。
