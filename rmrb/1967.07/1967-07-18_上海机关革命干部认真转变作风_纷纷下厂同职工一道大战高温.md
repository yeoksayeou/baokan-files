Revolutionary cadres in Shanghai municipal and district offices have enthusiastically responded to the call of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, seriously transforming their style of work. They are taking turns to go to the most crucial and arduous production sites on the industrial and transportation fronts for short-term labor, joining the broad masses of workers to fight against the high temperatures and promote the revolutionization of thought and work. The first batch of nearly 5,000 cadres have already gone to railways, ports, and various factories in the steel, casting, glass, enamel, and textile industries.

Cadres in Shanghai municipal and district offices believe that going to the industrial and transportation fronts to fight against the high temperatures with the broad masses of workers is a practical action to transform their style of work, strengthen their feelings for the working class, and change their worldview. Many units have organized several groups of cadres who can participate in labor, ensuring that nearly a quarter of the cadres and staff are always in the factories during the high-temperature season. Each group of cadres going to the factories for labor is led by responsible persons from the revolutionary committees or revolutionary mass organizations.

Cadres frequently participating in production labor is an effective measure to maintain close ties with the masses and prevent bureaucratism and revisionism. Many cadres have strengthened their feelings for the working people in the struggle against high temperatures in production.

Some cadres in Shanghai factories and enterprises have also gone deep into high-temperature workstations, insisting on fighting side by side with the masses.

    上海机关革命干部认真转变作风
    纷纷下厂同职工一道大战高温
    据新华社上海十六日电　上海市、区两级机关的革命干部热烈响应上海市革命委员会的号召，认真转变作风，轮流到工业交通战线生产最需要、最艰苦的地方作短期劳动，同广大职工一道，大战高温，促进思想和工作革命化。第一批近五千人已先后分赴铁路、海港，以及钢铁、铸锻、玻璃、搪瓷、纺织等行业的部分工厂。
    上海市、区两级机关革命干部认为，到工交战线去同广大职工一道大战高温，是干部转变作风，增强工人阶级感情，改造世界观的一个实际行动。不少单位把能参加劳动的干部，组成了若干批，使在高温季节经常有将近四分之一的干部和职工下厂。每批下厂劳动的干部，都有革命委员会或革命群众组织的负责人带领。
    干部经常参加生产劳动，是密切联系群众，免除官僚主义、修正主义的一项有力措施。很多干部在战高温的生产斗争中，增强了劳动人民的感情。
　　上海一些工厂企业的干部，也纷纷深入到高温工作岗位，坚持和群众并肩战斗。
