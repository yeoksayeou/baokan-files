    American Journalist Laments
    Increasing Troops Cannot Save the U.S. Empire

    On the 4th and 5th, the Associated Press reporter Wheeler in Saigon consecutively reported the miserable situation of U.S. troops in Vietnam, suffering heavy casualties. He said that since this year, in the area near the 17th parallel, about one thousand marines have been killed and seven thousand wounded. This has severely weakened the main force of the U.S. troops in Vietnam, the Third Marine Expeditionary Force, rendering it nearly incapacitated.

    This American journalist anxiously said: "A year ago, eliminating a platoon of U.S. troops was considered a major disaster. Now, entire companies of troops are being wiped out, and entire battalions are being forced to withdraw from the battlefield because their strength has been reduced to a dangerous level."

    U.S. newspapers admit that what makes Johnson even more "painful" is that even if, according to the demands of the U.S. commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, ten or twenty thousand more troops are sent, the problem still cannot be solved. The mouthpiece of U.S. monopoly capital, the Wall Street Journal, complained: "Those who now say sixty thousand are enough are the same people who once said forty thousand were enough." This newspaper admits: the "only real result" of last year's troop increase was the strengthening of the armed forces of the South Vietnamese people.

    美国记者哀叹
    增兵救不了美帝的命
    美联社驻西贡记者惠勒在四日和五日接连报道了侵越美军伤亡累累的狼狈处境。他说，今年以来，仅在十七度线以南附近地区，就有约一千名海军陆战队被打死，七千人受伤，使侵越美军主力之一的海军陆战队第三两栖部队元气大伤，溃不成军。
    这个美国记者不安地说：“一年前，消灭美军一个排就是一场大灾难，现在则有整连整连的军队被打垮，而且整营整营的军队由于兵力被削弱到危险水平之下而不得不撤出战场。”
    美国报纸承认使约翰逊甚至更加“痛苦”的是，即使按照美国侵越军头目威斯特摩兰的要求，再增兵十万、二十万，也仍然解决不了问题。美国垄断资本的喉舌《华尔街日报》抱怨说：“那些现在说六十万人就够了的人，就是那些一度说四十万人就够了的人”；这家报纸承认：去年增兵的“唯一真正结果”是南越人民武装增强了。　（据新华社讯）
