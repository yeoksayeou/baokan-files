The largest revolutionary mass organization at the Beijing Wool Clothing Factory, the "Red Rebel Corps," has, in the process of seizing and exercising power, consistently paid attention to grasping the direction of the struggle. They have correctly treated other revolutionary mass organizations, thus promoting the great unity of the revolutionary masses in the factory and mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers to "grasp revolution and promote production." In the first quarter of this year, the factory completed the state production plan ahead of schedule, while reducing unnecessary personnel and ensuring product quality.

First, look at the overall direction of other organizations

At the end of last year, when the conservative organization "Defense Corps," manipulated by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, was about to collapse, some people split from it and formed the "Eager to be a Student Fighter Squad," directing their struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. At that time, the core members of the "Defense Corps" cursed them as "traitors," and some masses said they were "opportunists." How should one treat this fighter squad? The comrades of the "Red Rebel Corps" calmly analyzed this issue and believed that it was not surprising for the "Defense Corps" to curse them as "traitors," which precisely proved that the handful of people were most afraid of the masses rising up in revolution. Saying they were "opportunists" was also wrong. Although they had made mistakes in the past, they had now come to realize this and directed their struggle against the handful of class enemies they had previously wanted to defend. This was a revolutionary action and should be welcomed. Thus, the "Red Rebel Corps" actively supported them and encouraged them not to be afraid of the curses from the "Defense Corps" and to dare to stand firm. The "Eager to be a Student Fighter Squad" was greatly encouraged and immediately launched a counterattack, exposing the secrets of the "Defense Corps" being manipulated by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. The comrades of the "Red Rebel Corps" further realized from this that in dealing with a mass organization, one should first look at their current direction of struggle. If one clings to their past shortcomings and mistakes, it is actually not allowing others to revolutionize.

This factory has a "Jinggangshan Fighter Corps." In the past, this organization did not align with either the "Defense Corps" or the "Red Rebel Corps" and had always maintained a wait-and-see attitude. Later, during the "Red Rebel Corps'" exposure of the capitalist reactionary line, they realized that the direction of the "Defense Corps" was wrong and actively expressed their willingness to join the "Red Rebel Corps" in a common struggle against the enemy. However, some comrades in the "Red Rebel Corps" thought that the "Jinggangshan Fighter Corps" had an unsteady stance in the previous stage, and now that the trend was clear, they wanted to unite with the proletarian revolutionary masses. Whether they were truly revolutionary was very doubtful. The core leadership of the "Red Rebel Corps" disagreed with this view. They mobilized everyone to study Chairman Mao's relevant works, discussed this issue, and finally realized: revolution has its early and late stages, and rebellion has its first and last. This is in accordance with the law of people's cognition. The proletarian revolutionary masses must adopt the attitude of "rebelling today, welcoming today, rebelling tomorrow, welcoming tomorrow" to treat those who rise up in revolution, and absolutely cannot doubt or criticize others just because they rose up in revolution late. After unifying their understanding, everyone enthusiastically expressed their willingness to unite with the "Jinggangshan Fighter Corps" in battle.

Later, a revolutionary mass organization with very few members also expressed their willingness to unite with the "Red Rebel Corps" to jointly fight against the enemy. Is it worth uniting with such a small organization? Some people expressed doubts. The comrades of the "Red Rebel Corps" believed that although this mass organization was small, its direction was correct, and it could not be ignored just because they were small; otherwise, it would be standing on the position of guildism and factionalism.

Timely attention to resolving internal differences

After the revolutionary masses united to seize power, many people wanted to join revolutionary mass organizations. The "Red Rebel Corps" had stricter procedures for expanding its organization. Some other revolutionary mass organizations were not like this. As a result, people who the "Red Rebel Corps" considered did not meet the conditions were recruited by other organizations. This situation caused differences among the revolutionary mass organizations: one side said, "They are recruiting soldiers, so we should also 'recruit'!" The other side said, "Expanding organizations is a matter of freedom, and no one can interfere with anyone." The comrades of the "Red Rebel Corps" believed that if this situation continued, it would lead to revolutionary masses competing to expand their organizations, and bad elements would easily infiltrate the revolutionary ranks to create divisions.

How to solve this problem? The "Red Rebel Corps" and the "Jinggangshan Fighter Corps" took the lead in jointly studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and carried out open rectification. During the study, through exposing thoughts, presenting viewpoints, and presenting problems, they broadly listened to the masses' opinions, and everyone's understanding was raised. Previously, some people thought that the disputes caused by expanding organizations were "internal trivial issues," but now they realized that it was the beginning of the rise of localism, and it was the "self" in their minds playing tricks. They actively carried out criticism and self-criticism, especially self-criticism, and firmly seized the power of the "self" in their minds to overcome localism. Then, they rectified their organizations, carefully examined, and expelled those who should not have been recruited.

Never have "selfish" intentions at any time

In light of the experience and lessons from this expansion of organizations, various revolutionary mass organizations felt that in order to jointly exercise power well, use power well, concentrate forces to carry out a thorough criticism and reform the factory, they must further unite in thought and organization.

At that time, some people said, "The 'Red Rebel Corps' started the revolution earliest, had the greatest merit, the highest prestige, and the largest organization. Other revolutionary mass organizations should merge into them and be called the 'Red Rebel Corps'." However, the core leadership of the "Red Rebel Corps" believed that this should not be done. Because if this was done, even if other revolutionary mass organizations agreed on the surface, they would say in their hearts: "Big or small, it is still a revolutionary mass organization. Just because your organization is big, should we listen to you and be annexed by you?" Conservative forces would also attack the "Red Rebel Corps" for merging the small with the big, sowing discord, and creating divisions. The core leadership of the "Red Rebel Corps" mobilized members to seriously study this issue and unanimously believed that the class struggle after seizing power was still very sharp and complex. In handling any issue, one must first put revolutionary interests first and never have "selfish" intentions at any time. Therefore, they actively proposed to various revolutionary mass organizations: "The 'Red Rebel Corps' and other revolutionary mass organizations should cancel their names, and the entire factory should establish a unified revolutionary mass organization—'June 23 Revolutionary Combat Corps.' Other revolutionary mass organizations unanimously agreed with this opinion. In May this year, they elected the core leadership of the 'June 23 Revolutionary Combat Corps' within the organization according to the election principles of the Paris Commune.

    北京呢绒服装厂几个革命群众组织是怎样实现革命大联合的？
    革命不分先后　组织不分大小
    勇于破私立公　团结一致对敌
    本报讯　北京呢绒服装厂最大的革命群众组织“红色造反团”，在夺权和掌权过程中，始终注意掌握斗争大方向，正确对待其他革命群众组织，较快地促进了全厂革命派的大联合，调动了广大职工“抓革命，促生产”的积极性。今年第一季度，全厂在精简不必要人员和保证产品质量的情况下，提前完成了国家生产计划。
    首先看其他组织的大方向
    去年年底，当受党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派操纵的保守组织“捍卫团”快要瓦解的时候，一些人从其中分化出来成立了“甘当小学生战斗队”，把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。当时，“捍卫团”的骨干分子骂他们是“叛徒”，有些群众说他们“投机”。究竟应该怎样对待这个战斗队呢？“红色造反团”的同志冷静地分析了这个问题，认为“捍卫团”的人骂他们是“叛徒”，并不奇怪，恰好证明那一小撮人最害怕群众起来革命。说他们“投机”，也是不对的。他们过去虽然犯了错误，现在觉悟过来了，把斗争的矛头对准原来要保的一小撮阶级敌人，是一种革命行动，应当表示欢迎。于是，“红色造反团”就主动地支持他们，鼓励他们不要害怕“捍卫团”的辱骂，要敢于顶住。“甘当小学生战斗队”得到很大的鼓舞，立即大杀回马枪，揭露党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派操纵“捍卫团”的内幕。“红色造反团”的同志从这里进一步认识到，对待一个群众组织，首先应该看他们当前的斗争大方向。如果抓住他们过去的缺点和错误不放，实际上就是不准许别人革命。
    这个工厂有一个“井冈山战斗团”。过去，这个组织对“捍卫团”和“红色造反团”都不靠拢，一直采取观望态度。后来，在“红色造反团”揭露资产阶级反动路线的过程中，他们认识到“捍卫团”的大方向是错的，就积极表示愿和“红色造反团”一起共同对敌。但是，“红色造反团”有些同志认为，“井冈山战斗团”在前一阶段立场不坚定，现在眼看大势所趋，要和无产阶级革命派联合，是不是真革命，很值得怀疑。“红色造反团”的核心领导不同意这种看法。他们发动大家结合学习毛主席的有关著作，讨论了这个问题。大家最后认识到：革命有迟有早，造反有先有后，这是符合人们认识的规律的。无产阶级革命派必须抱着“今天造反，今天欢迎，明天造反，明天欢迎”的态度，来对待起来革命的人，绝对不能因为人家起来革命迟了，就加以怀疑、指责。大家认识统一后，热烈表示愿和“井冈山战斗团”联合作战。
    后来，有一个人数很少的革命群众组织也表示要和“红色造反团”联合起来，共同对敌。对于这样一个小小的组织也值得联合吗？有的人表示怀疑。“红色造反团”的同志认为，这个群众组织虽然很小，但是它的大方向是正确的，决不能因为他们组织小，就不重视和它联合；如果这样，就站到行会主义和山头主义的立场上去了。
    及时注意解决内部的分歧
    革命派联合夺权后，不少人要求参加革命群众组织。“红色造反团”发展组织的手续比较严格。有些别的革命群众组织则不是这样。结果，“红色造反团”认为不够条件的人，却被别的组织吸收了。这种情况引起了革命群众组织之间的分歧：一方说：“他们这样招兵买马，我们也来‘招’吧！”一方说：“发展组织各有自由，谁也不能干涉谁。”“红色造反团”的同志们认为，这样发展下去，会引起革命派之间争相发展组织，坏分子就很容易混进革命队伍内部来制造分裂。
    如何解决这个问题？“红色造反团”和“井冈山战斗团”，带头和其他革命群众组织共同活学活用毛主席著作，开门整风。在学习过程中，经过亮思想，摆观点，摆问题，广泛听取群众的意见，大家的认识有了提高。以前，有些人认为，发展组织中引起的争论，是“内部的枝节问题”，现在认识到是小团体主义思想开始抬头，是头脑中的“私”字在作怪。他们积极开展批评和自我批评，特别是多作自我批评，狠夺自己头脑中的“私”字的权，克服小团体主义思想。接着，他们整顿组织，经过慎重的审查，把一些不应该吸收的人清除了出去。
    任何时候不能有“私”的打算
    鉴于这次发展组织的经验教训，各革命群众组织感到，为了共同掌好权、用好权，集中力量搞好革命的大批判和本厂的斗批改，必须从思想上组织上进一步联合起来。
    当时，有人说，“红色造反团”革命最早，功劳最大，威信最高，组织最大，其他的革命群众组织应该合并到他们那里去，统称“红色造反团”。但是，“红色造反团”的领导核心认为不能这样做。因为这样做，其他革命群众组织即使表面上赞成，心里也会说：“大小也是一个革命群众组织，你的组织大，就该听你的、受你并吞吗？”保守势力更会攻击“红色造反团”以大并小，从中挑拨离间，制造分裂。“红色造反团”的核心领导发动成员认真研究了这个问题，一致认为，夺权以后的阶级斗争仍然非常尖锐复杂，处理任何问题，首先必须以革命利益为重，在任何时候都不能有“私”的打算。因此，他们积极主动向各革命群众组织建议：“红色造反团”和其他革命群众组织的名称都取消，全厂成立统一的革命群众组织——“六·二三”革命战团。其他革命群众组织一致赞同这个意见。今年五月，他们在内部按照巴黎公社的选举原则，选出了“六·二三”革命战团的领导核心。
