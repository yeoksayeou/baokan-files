The revolutionary teachers and students of the Veterinary and Animal Husbandry College of Qinghai University have smashed the conspiracy of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and united with the college's deputy director, Comrade Da Luo, to jointly hold power and use it well.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Xining, July 10—The revolutionary teachers and students of the Veterinary and Animal Husbandry College of Qinghai University have used the method of class analysis as instructed by our great leader Chairman Mao to correctly distinguish and deal with proletarian leaders and capitalist-roaders in power. They dared to support Comrade Da Luo, the deputy director who was labeled as a "counter-revolutionary" twice by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the bourgeois reactionary line, and joined forces with him. They elected him as the chairman of the college revolutionary committee to jointly hold power and use it well.

At the beginning of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution last year, Comrade Da Luo (Tibetan) bravely stood up and firmly supported the revolutionary masses, fighting alongside the revolutionary teachers and students against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the college. He exposed their revisionist educational line. Therefore, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee saw the revolutionary teachers and students of this college as a thorn in their side and a bone in their throat, doing everything they could to persecute Comrade Da Luo. They, in the name of the Provincial Party Committee, instructed the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee, where Da Luo had previously worked, to fabricate a large number of so-called "crimes" of Da Luo under the guise of "mass exposure." As a result, not only was Da Luo labeled as a "counter-revolutionary," but dozens of revolutionary teachers and students were also labeled as "counter-revolutionaries." Even those who sympathized with Da Luo, including revolutionary teachers and students, their families, and colleagues from other units, were persecuted. Under the white terror, the revolutionary teachers and students were not intimidated. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching, "We must look at things from their essence, and regard their phenomena only as guides to entry," to analyze the big-character posters sent by the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee exposing Da Luo. They found that the contents were full of contradictions and seemed to be made from the same mold. They compared Da Luo's performance after he was transferred to the school with the "crimes" exposed in the big-character posters, finding that they did not match at all. At the same time, they studied the actions of a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Provincial Party Committee.

After analyzing and studying, they believed that this was a deliberate attempt by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee to confuse the distinction between proletarian leaders and capitalist-roaders in power, to shift the direction of the struggle, and to direct the spearhead at proletarian leaders to save their own doom.

After the "Sixteen Points" personally drafted by Chairman Mao were published, the revolutionary teachers and students gained boundless strength and became even clearer about the direction of the struggle. The revolutionary flames burned more fiercely. A capitalist-roader within the Qinghai Provincial Party Committee, fearing that their conspiracy would be exposed, personally came to the school to arrange countermeasures, saying that you must fiercely fight against Da Luo, overthrow him, and smear him so that no one dares to rehabilitate him. Soon, this capitalist-roader came to the school for the second time, instructing the conservative organizations to surround and fight Da Luo. This was met with resistance from the revolutionary teachers and students. They then played another trick, taking advantage of the National Day parade by revolutionary teachers and students, using illegal abduction methods to kidnap Comrade Da Luo to the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture for even more brutal struggles. At the same time, the streets of Xining were filled with printed leaflets about Da Luo's crimes, listing "crimes" that were shocking to hear. For a time, it was chaotic, and anyone who spoke out for Da Luo would be attacked and persecuted, even labeled as "counter-revolutionaries." The school authorities also illegally published the historical files of some comrades from exploitative class backgrounds, attempting to use the reactionary "bloodline theory" to save straw and label these comrades who protected revolutionary cadres as "counter-revolutionaries."

How to withstand this counter-revolutionary tide created by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee was a severe test for the revolutionary faction. At that time, two kinds of thoughts emerged within the revolutionary faction: one thought that it was best to avoid the issue of Da Luo for the time being and not get entangled in it, otherwise, it might end up with the label of "royalist," which would not be beneficial to the "revolution"; the other thought that it was necessary to confront and fight resolutely. After heated debates, they finally reached a consensus, believing that a true proletarian revolutionary must prioritize revolutionary interests, firmly protect and support proletarian leaders, and not fear any sacrifice; if one harbors private thoughts and remains silent, one would objectively help a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and in the end, one would become a true royalist. Therefore, whether or not to protect revolutionary cadres first depends on whether one dares to overthrow the "self" in one's mind.

To expose the conspiracy of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee, they sent people to Da Luo's hometown and places where he had previously worked for investigations three times. At the same time, many comrades, risking being labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," went to connect with Da Luo, encouraging him to continue the struggle. At that time, although Da Luo had lost his freedom of speech and action, he still cared about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the entire school. He said: I must follow Chairman Mao to the end of the revolution. Under the white terror, he still provided materials about the crimes of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee to the revolutionary teachers and students.

At the end of September last year, when revolutionary teachers and students went out for the second investigation, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee discovered it and immediately notified the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee to closely monitor the actions of revolutionary students. The Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee, like facing a major enemy, illegally detained the revolutionary students and the Red Guards from other provinces who helped them, slandering them as "spies sent by Taiwan." They organized the masses of herdsmen who were not clear about the truth to surround and fight them for three days and three nights. In December, during the third investigation to the pastoral area, the class enemy spread the word in advance: the herdsmen have sharpened their knives waiting for you! However, to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they fearlessly went down to the pastoral area. Some bad cadres in the local area carried guns everywhere, threatening the herdsmen not to approach them, and making life difficult for them in every way, trying to drive them away. However, they were not intimidated, living in the herdsmen's tents, helping with labor while propagating Mao Zedong Thought and the "Sixteen Points," visiting the poor, mobilizing the masses. After the masses were mobilized, they exposed the various crimes of the bad cadres, bringing down their arrogance. After removing the obstacles, they braved the wind and snow, trekking through the sparsely populated grasslands, visiting poor herdsmen. After nearly two months of arduous struggle, they gathered a large amount of material. These materials proved that Comrade Da Luo is a revolutionary cadre, and the many charges imposed on him by the Provincial Party Committee are pure fabrications; those who wrote big-character posters against Comrade Da Luo also admitted that they acted according to the instructions from above and did not know Da Luo at all.

After clarifying the facts, the revolutionary teachers and students were even more determined to support and protect Comrade Da Luo to the end, fighting side by side with him. Based on a large amount of solid factual materials, they repeatedly confronted a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Provincial Party Committee and the Hainan Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture Party Committee, refuting their shameless fabrications, exposing their political frame-ups, leaving them speechless and at a loss for words, forcing them to publicly rehabilitate Comrade Da Luo. Thus, a struggle to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line finally won. Now, the proletarian revolutionary faction of the Veterinary and Animal Husbandry College of Qinghai University has seized power from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Comrade Da Luo has been elected as the chairman of the college revolutionary committee. The revolutionary teachers and students are determined to hold power and use it well with him, carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

    坚决支持坚决保护革命的领导干部
    青海大学畜牧兽医学院革命师生，粉碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋，和这个学院的副院长达洛同志结合一起，共同掌好权用好权
    据新华社西宁十日电　青海大学畜牧兽医学院的革命师生，运用我们伟大领袖毛主席指示的阶级分析的方法，正确区分和对待无产阶级当权派和走资本主义道路当权派，敢于支持两次被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线打成“反革命”的副院长达洛起来闹革命，跟他结合在一起，选他担任学院革命委员会的主任委员，共同掌好权，用好权。
    在去年文化大革命初期，这个学院的副院长达洛（藏族）就勇敢地站出来，坚决支持无产阶级革命派，和革命师生一起，跟校内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开面对面的斗争，揭发他们的修正主义教育路线。因此，省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派把这个学院的革命师生视为眼中钉，肉中刺，千方百计地迫害达洛同志。他们以省委名义，责成达洛同志过去工作过的海南藏族自治州州委，盗用“群众揭发”的名义，炮制出一大批所谓达洛“罪状”的大字报。这样，不但达洛同志被打成“反革命”，连同数十名革命师生也被打成“反革命”，甚至连同情达洛的革命师生、家属、外单位的同志都遭受到迫害。在白色恐怖笼罩下，革命的师生并没有被吓倒。他们根据毛主席“我们看事情必须要看它的实质，而把它的现象只看作入门的向导”的教导，分析了海南藏族自治州州委送来的揭发达洛的大字报，发现其中破绽百出，内容都象是一个模子里刻出来似的。大家对照了达洛同志调来学校后的种种表现，发现跟大字报上所揭发的“反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的罪行”根本对不上号。同时，他们研究了省委内一小撮反革命修正主义分子的所作所为。
    经过分析研究，他们认为这是省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派故意混淆无产阶级当权派和走资本主义道路当权派的界限，转移斗争大方向，把矛头指向无产阶级当权派以挽救他们自己的灭亡。
    毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条公布后，给革命师生增添了无穷的力量，更加明确了斗争的大方向，革命烈火越烧越旺。青海省委内一个走资本主义道路当权派，害怕他们玩弄的阴谋被戳穿，亲自到学校布置对策，说什么你们要狠斗达洛，斗倒、斗臭，斗得没有人敢给他翻案。不久，这个走资本主义道路当权派第二次来到学校，指示保守组织围斗达洛同志时，就遭到革命师生的抵制。于是他们又玩弄了一个花招，趁国庆节革命师生游行时，用非法绑架手段，将达洛同志劫持到海南藏族自治州，进行更加残酷的斗争。与此同时，西宁街头到处张贴着有关达洛罪行的铅印传单，列举的“罪状”，真是骇人听闻，一时间闹得乌云翻滚，谁出来为达洛说话，就要遭受围攻迫害，甚至被打成“反革命”。学校当局还非法公布了一些出身于剥削阶级家庭的同志的历史档案，妄图搬出反动的“血统论”捞稻草，把这些同志保革命的领导干部说成是为“反革命”翻案。
    如何顶住这股省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派一手制造的反革命逆流，这是革命派面临的严峻考验。革命派内部当时产生了两种思想：一种认为对达洛的问题最好回避一下，先不要纠缠这件事，不然弄不好落个“保皇派”的罪名，对“革命”不利；另一种认为应该针锋相对，坚决斗争。经过激烈争辩，最后统一了认识，认为真正的无产阶级革命派，就必须以革命利益为重，对无产阶级当权派要坚决保护，坚决支持，不怕付出任何代价；如果掺杂私心杂念，保持缄默，那就在客观上帮助了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，到头来倒会成了真正的保皇派。因此，敢不敢保革命的领导干部，首先要看敢不敢革自己头脑中“私”字的命。
    为了戳穿省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的阴谋，他们先后三次派人去达洛的家乡和他过去工作过的地方，进行实地调查。同时，许多同志还冒着被打成“反革命”的风险，去跟达洛串连，鼓励他坚持斗争。当时达洛同志虽然言行都失去了自由，但仍然关心全校的文化大革命，他表示：一定要跟着毛主席革命到底。他在白色恐怖下，仍给革命师生提供有关省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行材料。
    去年九月底，当革命师生第二次派人外出调查时，省委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派发现了，立即通知海南藏族自治州委，密切监视革命学生的行动。海南藏族自治州委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派如临大敌，将革命学生和帮助他们的外地红卫兵非法扣留，污蔑他们是“台湾派来的特务”。组织不明真相的牧民群众对他们围斗了三天三夜。去年十二月第三次前往牧区调查时，阶级敌人事前放出风说：牧民群众已经磨好刀等着你们哩！但是，为了保卫毛主席的革命路线，他们无所畏惧，坚决下到牧区。当地有的坏干部背上枪到处威胁牧民不准接近他们，生活上也处处刁难他们，使他们挨冻受饿，妄图把他们撵走。但是，他们没有被吓倒，住在牧民帐房里，一边帮助劳动，一边宣传毛泽东思想，宣传十六条，访贫问苦，发动群众。群众被发动起来后，揭发了坏干部的种种罪行，把这些人的威风打了下去。排除了绊脚石之后，他们冒着风雪严寒，跋涉在人烟稀少的草原上，访问贫苦牧民。经过将近两个月的艰苦斗争，他们掌握了大量的材料。这些材料证明：达洛同志是一个革命的领导干部，省委强加在达洛同志身上的许多罪名，纯属捏造；那些给达洛同志写大字报的人，自己也供认是按上边的意图行事的，根本不了解达洛其人。
    弄清事实真相之后，革命的师生更加下定决心，对达洛同志支持到底，保护到底，跟他并肩战斗。并且根据大量确凿的事实材料，向省委和海南藏族自治州委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开反复的面对面的斗争，批驳了他们的无耻捏造，揭穿了他们的政治陷害，使他们无言以对，理屈词穷，不得不给达洛同志公开平反。至此，一场捍卫毛主席的革命路线的斗争终于胜利了。现在，青海大学畜牧兽医学院无产阶级革命派已经夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，达洛同志已被选为学院革命委员会的主任委员，革命师生决心和他一起掌好权，用好权，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
