	"Revolutionary Teachers, We Welcome You!" is an article written by some revolutionary youngsters from Shanghai's Yongxing Road Second Primary School. This article, on one hand, sincerely criticizes teachers, encouraging them to smash the private and establish the public, and actively and proactively engage in work. On the other hand, it enthusiastically expresses welcome and support for revolutionary teachers, and is determined to work with revolutionary teachers to do a good job of resuming classes and making revolution. This is the revolutionary action of revolutionary youngsters nurtured by the invincible thought of Mao Zedong.

	Once this article came out, the revolutionary teachers of this school wrote an article titled "Applauding the Revolutionary Youngsters' Article," enthusiastically supporting the revolutionary actions of the revolutionary youngsters. They also mentioned in their letter to this newspaper that they organized teachers to discuss, study the works of Chairman Mao, and conduct self-examinations. At the same time, they organized all revolutionary teachers and students of the school to hold multiple criticism meetings, exposing and denouncing the harm of the bourgeois reactionary line, uprooting the poisonous roots, eliminating barriers, uniting all revolutionary teachers and students, and enthusiastically joining the struggle to resume classes and make revolution.

	The spirit of criticism and self-criticism shown by revolutionary teachers and students is commendable.

	Revolutionary teachers bear the glorious task of cultivating successors to the revolutionary cause. In the struggle to resume classes and make revolution, they should carry forward the spirit of proletarian revolutionary rebellion, not only rebelling against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, but also rebelling against the "self" in their own minds. Cast away the "fear" and smash the "self," bravely shoulder heavy responsibilities, and fully display initiative and creativity. Revolutionary students should also support and respect revolutionary teachers like the revolutionary youngsters of this school. Both sides, in the great criticism of the revolution, further deepen revolutionary friendship and establish a new type of teacher-student relationship. In this way, the resumption of classes and making revolution in primary and secondary schools can be done even better.

### 破私立公，复课闹革命

　　破私立公，复课闹革命
    《革命的老师，我们欢迎你！》是上海市永兴路第二小学的一些革命小将写的文章。这篇文章，一方面对教师提出诚恳的批评，鼓励他们破私立公，积极主动地开展工作；一方面满腔热情地表示欢迎和支持革命的教师，决心和革命教师共同搞好复课闹革命。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想所培育的革命小将的革命行动。
    这篇文章一出来，这个学校的革命教师就写了《为革命小将的文章叫好》的文章，热情支持革命小将的革命行动。他们在给本报的来信中还提到，他们还组织教师进行了讨论，学习毛主席著作，对照检查思想。同时，组织全校革命师生多次举行批判大会，揭发、控诉资产阶级反动路线的毒害，挖除毒根，消除隔阂，使全校革命师生团结起来，斗志昂扬地投入复课闹革命。
    革命师生的这种批评和自我批评精神，是值得赞扬的。
    革命教师担负着培养革命事业接班人的光荣任务。在复课闹革命的斗争中，应当发扬无产阶级革命造反精神，不仅造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，也要造自己头脑中“私”字的反。丢掉“怕”字，打掉“私”字，勇挑重担，充分发挥主动性、创造性。革命学生也应当象这个学校的革命小将那样，支持革命教师，尊重革命教师。双方在革命的大批判中，进一步增进革命的友谊，建立新型的师生关系。这样，中小学校的复课闹革命就能搞得更好。
