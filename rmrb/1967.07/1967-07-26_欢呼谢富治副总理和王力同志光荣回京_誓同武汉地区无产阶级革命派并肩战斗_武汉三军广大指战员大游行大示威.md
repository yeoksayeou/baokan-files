The broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in Wuhan, who are closely united with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, held a grand demonstration and parade today. They enthusiastically celebrated the glorious return of Vice Premier Xie Fuzhi and Comrade Wang Li to Beijing, and the resolute support of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat from all over the country for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Wuhan area.

The soldiers and officers participating in the parade firmly declared: We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely fight alongside the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Wuhan area, and thoroughly overthrow and expose the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road who have infiltrated the Party, the government, and the military. We will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Today, soldiers and officers from the army, navy, and air force, holding copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and wearing Mao badges, rode in hundreds of trucks through the streets of Wuhan's three cities. Wherever they went, the crowds cheered and applauded enthusiastically. The parade chanted slogans such as: "Defend the Party Central Committee to the death!" "Defend Chairman Mao to the death!" "Defend Vice Chairman Lin to the death!" "Defend the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the death!" "Learn from the revolutionary masses of the proletariat!" "Long live the victorious proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!"

The soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Wuhan-based Air Force of the People's Liberation Army said excitedly: The return of Comrades Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li to Beijing is a victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The support of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat from all over the country for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Wuhan area is a great encouragement and spur for us! We must unconditionally complete the glorious task of supporting the revolutionary leftists assigned to us by the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group. We must resolutely unite with, fight alongside, and achieve victory with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Wuhan area. We must resolutely expose and denounce the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road who have infiltrated the Party, the government, and the military. The broad cadres of the Wuhan Air Force leadership also declared: We will resolutely carry the revolution through to the end, live for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and die for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line; we will resolutely stand with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Wuhan area, fight wherever needed, and achieve victory wherever needed. The commander of a certain battalion in the Wuhan-based troops, Lan Qingxiang, said excitedly: The return of Vice Premier Xie and Comrade Wang Li to Beijing is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought and a great victory for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We will resolutely stand with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Wuhan area, and be their strong backbone, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao. The entire unit of soldiers and officers from the former unit of martyr Qiu Shaoyun unanimously declared their determination: We will defend Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death. The more critical the moment, the more we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely act according to Mao Zedong Thought, forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Our heads can be cut off, our blood can be shed, but Mao Zedong Thought cannot be abandoned, and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line cannot be abandoned.

The soldiers and officers said: The Party Central Committee's directives on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan area are completely correct. We wholeheartedly support them and will resolutely carry them out, and resolutely support the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Wuhan area. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a crucial moment of decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!
