French Communist Youth League (Marxist-Leninist) publication "Serving the People" bi-weekly recently published an article condemning the fascist anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities committed by the Burmese reactionary government.

The article states: The Burmese people have a traditional friendship with the Chinese people. The purpose of Ne Win's anti-China and anti-Chinese actions is to divert the Burmese people's dissatisfaction with the Ne Win reactionary government.

In discussing the current worsening economic situation in Burma, where people are suffering greatly, the article points out, "This is all the result of the Burmese leaders, who serve U.S. imperialism, cruelly oppressing the people."

The article states that the Burmese people, under the leadership of the glorious Burmese Communist Party, have long been engaged in fierce struggles. "The Burmese people, following the teachings of Mao Zedong, have relied on their own strength to wage armed struggle for nineteen years."

The article states that, like all reactionaries, the Burmese reactionaries and their American masters are making their final struggles, but they, like some fools, will only end up hurting themselves by doing so.

    法国共产主义青联（马列）刊物谴责缅反动政府反华暴行
    奈温反动政府反华是搬起石头打自己的脚
    新华社巴黎二十二日电　法国共产主义青年联盟（马克思列宁主义）出版的《为人民服务》半月刊最近发表文章，谴责缅甸反动政府的反华、排华法西斯暴行。
    文章说：缅甸人民对中国人民有传统的友谊。奈温的反华、排华的目的在于转移缅甸人民对奈温反动政府的不满。
    文章在谈到当前缅甸经济恶化，民不聊生的状况时指出，“这都是由于为美帝效劳的缅甸头目残酷压迫人民的结果。”
    文章说，缅甸人民在光荣的缅甸共产党领导下早已展开了激烈的斗争。“缅甸人民按照毛泽东的教导，十九年来，依靠自己的力量，一直在进行武装斗争。”
    文章说，象所有的反动派一样，缅甸反动派和它的美国主子正在作垂死的挣扎，但是他们正如某些蠢人一样，这样做只能是搬起石头打自己的脚。
