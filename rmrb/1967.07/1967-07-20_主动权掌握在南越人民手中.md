The battlefield in South Vietnam has continuously sent out heartening reports of victory. The armed forces of the South Vietnamese liberation movement have used unexpected surprise tactics to severely strike at important military bases of the U.S. invading forces.

On July 7, the liberation armed forces in Binh Dinh Province attacked the logistics base of the U.S. 1st Cavalry Division, killing 200 U.S. soldiers and destroying 16 U.S. aircraft.

On July 11, the assault teams of the liberation armed forces in Phuoc Long Province attacked the U.S. Danang Air Base, killing more than 500 U.S. and puppet soldiers, destroying a large number of tanks and armored vehicles, and burning down fuel depots.

On July 15, the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces launched their seventh attack on the U.S. air base in Da Nang, destroying 42 U.S. aircraft and killing or wounding more than 180 U.S. soldiers in just five minutes.

This series of surprise attacks has left the U.S. invading forces in a state of panic and terror.

The South Vietnamese liberation armed forces do not have a single aircraft or missile, but they can not only shoot down enemy planes in the sky with rifles but also find ways to destroy dozens of enemy planes in just a few minutes, killing hundreds of U.S. soldiers. Is this not a miracle in the history of warfare?

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us, "Weapons are an important factor in war, but they are not the decisive factor; it is people, not things, that are decisive." People have conscious initiative. Revolutionary people and revolutionary armies, with their high revolutionary consciousness and extraordinary courage and wisdom, can create endlessly in war. The assault teams of the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces are a "flying corps" of the South Vietnamese people. This "flying corps" does not need airfields, does not need fuel, cannot be detected by radar, and cannot be countered by rockets. They come when they want to come, fight when they want to fight, and always hit their targets. They come suddenly and leave cleanly, like heavenly soldiers.

This series of surprise attacks shows that the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces and the broad masses of the South Vietnamese people firmly grasp the initiative in the war. They ride the waves and control the tides in the sea of war, moving freely towards the shore of victory.

The situation of the U.S. invaders is completely the opposite. They have gathered more than a million U.S. and puppet troops and mercenary forces, equipped with aircraft, artillery, tanks, and various modern weapons. However, they are still everywhere on the defensive, taking blows. The U.S. invading forces are not only surrounded and annihilated by the liberation armed forces in the vast rural areas and mountainous regions of South Vietnam, but their so-called "offensives" are also smashed to pieces, completely losing the initiative. Even when they hide in heavily guarded turtle shells like Da Nang, they cannot escape the fate of being beaten, and they are beaten again and again. The bloated and clumsy U.S. invaders are flustered and struggling desperately in the vast sea of people's war, but ultimately they cannot escape the fate of being drowned.

Chairman Mao says, "Freedom of action is the lifeline of an army. Once this freedom is lost, the army is close to being defeated or annihilated. The disarming of a soldier is the result of his loss of freedom of action and being placed in a passive position. The defeat of an army is the same."

Now it is clear that the U.S. invading forces and their mercenary troops have increasingly less freedom of action on the battlefield in South Vietnam. The South Vietnamese liberation armed forces creatively use the strategies and tactics of people's war, being able to drag out the U.S. invading forces to fight and also being able to directly strike at their turtle shells, fighting in the enemy's lair. The U.S. invaders build an airbase here and a base there, all of which have become heavy burdens for themselves and targets for the South Vietnamese liberation armed forces to attack. All this proves that even if the U.S. invaders increase their cannon fodder by tens of thousands, they will never be able to reverse their fate of complete failure.

    主动权掌握在南越人民手中
    本报评论员
    南越战场连续传来振奋人心的捷报。南越解放武装力量用出其不意的奇袭战术，狠狠地打击了美国侵略军的重要军事基地。
    七月七日，平定省解放武装力量袭击美军第一骑兵师后勤基地，消灭美军二百名，美机十六架。
    七月十一日，土龙木省解放武装力量的突击队又袭击美军达尼机场，消灭美伪军五百多名，击毁大量坦克和装甲车，烧毁汽油库。
    七月十五日，南越解放武装力量对岘港美军空军基地发动第七次袭击，五分钟之内击毁美机四十二架，毙伤美军一百八十多人。
    这一连串的奇袭，使美国侵略军丧魂落魄，吓破了胆。
    南越解放武装力量没有一架飞机，没有一枚导弹，但是他们除了能够用步枪击落在天空的敌机以外，还有办法在几分钟之内击毁敌机几十架，消灭美军几百人，这难道不是战争史上的奇迹吗？
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说，“武器是战争的重要的因素，但不是决定的因素，决定的因素是人不是物。”人是有自觉的能动性的。革命的人民，革命的军队，具有高度的革命觉悟和非凡的勇敢机智，可以在战争中进行无穷的创造。南越解放武装力量的突击队就是南越人民的一支“空军师”。这个“空军师”，一不要机场，二无需汽油，雷达侦察不出，火箭应付不了。他们要来就来，要打就打，而且每打必命中。他们来得突然，走得也干脆，简直是天兵天将。
    这一系列的奇袭，表明南越解放武装力量和广大南越人民，牢牢地掌握了战争的主动权。他们在战争的海洋中驾波驭浪，俯仰自如，一步步向着胜利的彼岸接近。
    美国侵略者的处境则完全相反。它纠合了一百多万美伪军和帮凶军，装备着飞机、大炮、坦克和各种新式武器，但是却仍然到处被动挨打。美国侵略军不仅在南越的广大农村和山区，到处遭到解放武装力量的围歼，它的一个又一个所谓“攻势”被砸得粉碎，完全失去了主动权。就连躲到象岘港那样有重兵守卫的乌龟壳里，还是逃不了挨打的命运，而且一而再、再而三地挨打。臃肿笨重的美国侵略者在人民战争的汪洋大海中，手忙脚乱，拚命挣扎，然而终究难逃最后灭顶的命运。
    毛主席说：“行动自由是军队的命脉，失了这种自由，军队就接近于被打败或被消灭。一个士兵被缴械，是这个士兵失了行动自由被迫处于被动地位的结果。一个军队的战败，也是一样。”
    现在已经看得很清楚，美国侵略军和它的帮凶军在南越战场上的行动自由已经越来越少了。南越解放武装力量创造性地运用了人民战争的战略战术，可以把美国侵略军揪出来打，也可以直捣它的乌龟壳，在敌人的巢穴里打。美国侵略者东搞一个机场，西筑一个基地，全都成了它们自己沉重的包袱，成了南越解放武装力量袭击的目标。这一切证明，美国侵略者即使再增加多少万炮灰，也决挽回不了它们彻底失败的命运。
