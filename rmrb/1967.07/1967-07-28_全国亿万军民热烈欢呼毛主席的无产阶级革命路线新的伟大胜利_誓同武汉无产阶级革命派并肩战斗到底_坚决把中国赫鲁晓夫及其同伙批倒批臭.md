"Comrades in the revolutionary ranks of the proletariat in Wuhan! Your struggle is not isolated. The People's Liberation Army firmly supports you! The proletarian revolutionary ranks across the nation firmly support you! Victory will surely belong to the proletarian revolutionary ranks in Wuhan armed with Mao Zedong Thought!" In recent days, this powerful voice has resonated across the vast land of our great motherland.

Since the joyous news of Comrades Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li triumphantly and honorably returning to Chairman Mao from Wuhan, the proletarian revolutionary ranks, revolutionary masses, and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army across the nation have been overjoyed and full of fighting spirit. In the past few days, millions have held grand rallies and demonstrations, warmly celebrating the new great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. A massive movement to firmly support the proletarian revolutionary ranks in Wuhan and vehemently denounce the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan is continuing to unfold across cities and countryside nationwide.

Revolutionary ranks of the proletariat and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army across various regions have pointed out that our great leader Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin personally attended the rally of a million military and civilians in the capital to support the proletarian revolutionary ranks in Wuhan. This is the greatest care and support for the proletarian revolutionary ranks in Wuhan and across the nation. With our great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee backing us, we will definitely overcome all difficulties and obstacles on the road ahead, and carry the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to victory, throwing all those in power taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army into the dustbin of history!

In our great motherland's capital and the largest industrial city in China, Shanghai, after holding grand rallies and demonstrations with a million participants, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionary ranks, revolutionary masses, and garrison soldiers and officers have continued to support the proletarian revolutionary ranks in Wuhan in an even broader and deeper manner.

In recent days, the broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, and revolutionary students and teachers in the capital have held support rallies, criticism meetings, and oath-taking rallies, vehemently denouncing the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of those in power taking the capitalist road in Wuhan and their agents who control the "Million Heroes" for their frenzied counterattacks. At various meetings, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionary ranks and revolutionary masses have unanimously expressed their most resolute support for the revolutionary struggle of the proletarian revolutionary ranks in Wuhan, vowing to unite with them, fight with them, and win with them. Everyone pointed out that the handful of those in power taking the capitalist road within the Party are not dead tigers, and we must not let our guard down against them. We must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating fallen enemies to the ground, thoroughly criticize and expose them, and ensure they never rise again.

The broad masses of proletarian revolutionary ranks, revolutionary masses, and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army garrison in Shanghai today continue to strongly support the revolutionary struggle of the proletarian revolutionary ranks in Wuhan with even greater political enthusiasm. From morning to night, columns of marching teams with high spirits, waving red flags, chanting slogans, and marching with vigorous steps, have been seen on the main streets across the city. Many factories, enterprises, institutions, and schools have held denunciation meetings and criticism meetings, launching a fierce campaign of criticism and struggle against the handful of those in power taking the capitalist road within the Party. They are determined to support the proletarian revolutionary ranks in Wuhan with actual actions of thoroughly criticizing and exposing the handful of those in power taking the capitalist road within the Party.

In Chongqing, in the past few days, tens of thousands of people have taken to the streets in demonstrations despite the scorching heat. On the 26th, the garrison soldiers and officers held a magnificent armed demonstration. The participating garrison soldiers and officers and the proletarian revolutionary ranks pointed out that crows' wings cannot block the sun, and small ants cannot shake a giant tree. The frenzied counterattacks by the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in Wuhan will only result in them lifting a stone to drop on their own feet. They firmly declared that they would definitely raise the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, closely follow Chairman Mao's great strategic deployments, launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize and expose the Chinese Khrushchev, thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of those in power taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army in Wuhan, and thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of bad leaders persisting in the bourgeois reactionary line within the "Million Heroes," seizing new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces in Nanjing, along with the proletarian revolutionary ranks and revolutionary masses in Nanjing, today held rallies and demonstrations with 400,000 people. From dawn to night, the streets were filled with endless marching columns. The responsible officials of the Nanjing garrison, Du Ping, Liang Jieqing, and Du Fangping, spoke at the rallies of the three military branches and the military and civilian masses. They pointed out that the frenzied counterattacks by the handful of those in power taking the capitalist road within the Party only incite greater hatred from the people across the nation, accelerating their doom. The People's Liberation Army is the people's army personally created and led by our great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. We will resolutely defend Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line with our lives and blood. Representatives of the proletarian revolutionary ranks from various fronts in Nanjing and representatives from the proletarian revolutionary ranks in Wuhan also spoke at the meeting. They expressed their determination to expose all those in power taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army, and fight them down, fight them over, and fight them to the ground.

Fifteen hundred thousand proletarian revolutionary ranks, revolutionary masses, and garrison soldiers and officers in Zhejiang Province and Hangzhou City held a grand rally and demonstration on the evening of the 26th. The responsible officials of the garrison and representatives of local revolutionary mass organizations spoke at the meeting. They pointed out that the frenzied counterattacks by the number one person in power taking the capitalist road within the Party and his agents in Wuhan fully expose their reactionary nature. These bad guys are always watching for opportunities to counterattack. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and firmly strike them down mercilessly.

In the coastal defense city of Fuzhou, large-scale rallies and demonstrations were held yesterday and today. Representatives of local revolutionary mass organizations and garrison representatives spoke at the meeting, vehemently denouncing the handful of those in power taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army in Wuhan and the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes." They warmly praised the fearless revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolutionary ranks in Wuhan and expressed their determination to share the same breath, the same fate, and fight shoulder to shoulder with them to the end.

In the capital of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, Hohhot, today, 150,000 garrison soldiers and officers, proletarian revolutionary ranks, and revolutionary masses from various ethnic groups held rallies and demonstrations. Wu Tao, the deputy head of the Inner Mongolia Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group and the political commissar of the Inner Mongolia Military Region, pointed out in his speech at the meeting that the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan's frenzied counterattacks against the proletarian revolutionary ranks once again remind us to firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Do not pity snake-like evil people." We must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating fallen enemies to the ground, seize the key points, pursue and attack fiercely, and fight the handful of those in power taking the capitalist road within the Party represented by the Chinese Khrushchev to the ground and expose them thoroughly, not stopping until we achieve complete victory. Representatives of revolutionary mass organizations such as the Red Guards Third Command in Hohhot also vehemently denounced the heinous crimes committed by the handful of those in power taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army in Wuhan and the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" at the meeting.

In the past few days, in addition to the provincial capitals and the capitals of autonomous regions holding large-scale rallies and demonstrations, many medium and small cities, towns, and rural areas have also held rallies and demonstrations. In places like Zibo, Yantai, Changwei, Dezhou, Huimin, Heze, and Tai'an in Shandong Province, and in some remote towns in the Changbai Mountains and western grasslands of Jilin Province, the strong voices denouncing the handful of those in power taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army in Wuhan have been heard. The soldiers and officers of the Yunnan border defense troops guarding the southwestern border have also held rallies and demonstrations with the revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups in the garrison areas in the past few days, expressing their support for their revolutionary comrades in Wuhan. They said, "Thousands of mountains and tens of thousands of rivers cannot sever the flesh-and-blood ties between the border military and civilians and the proletarian revolutionary ranks in Wuhan, nor can they divide the common struggle of the proletarian revolutionary ranks across the nation to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death."
