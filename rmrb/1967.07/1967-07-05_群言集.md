	Voices of the Masses

	“Private Interests First, Civil War Unending”
	“Private interests first, civil war unending.” This hits the nail on the head. Currently, some revolutionary mass organizations are engaged in “civil war” with each other. Tracing the root cause, it all boils down to various manifestations of the “private” character—mountainheadism, cliquism, and the desire for personal glory, among others. To eliminate this “private” character and uproot the cause of “civil war,” we must lay the foundation for great revolutionary unity.

	“The Pot Isn’t Hot, the Cake Won’t Stick”
	When dealing with comrades who have faults and errors, we should approach them with warmth and help them, rather than treating them coldly or discriminating against them. As the saying goes, “The pot isn’t hot, the cake won’t stick.” To make others willing to come close to us and stick their hearts to ours, we must radiate class love from our hearts. If our “pot” is cold, how can the “cake” stick to it?

	“An Instant” and “A Lifetime”
	The heroic moment when Lü Xiangbi sacrificed his life to save others was the result of a lifetime of hard training. This instant is the crystallization of Mao Zedong Thought nurturing revolutionary fighters. A person’s lifetime is made up of countless “instants.” Only by accumulating countless red instants can one form a red lifetime. By dedicating every instant of one’s life to diligently studying Mao Zedong Thought, and by constantly reforming oneself in struggle, breaking away from private interests and establishing public spirit, one can, like Lü Xiangbi, shine with the brilliant light of communist thought in that instant.

　　群言集
    “私字当头，内战不休”
    “私字当头，内战不休”。这话正中要害。目前某些革命群众组织互相打“内战”，追其本，溯其源，不外是“私”字的种种表现形式——山头主义、小团体主义、风头主义等等在作怪。破除这个“私”字，挖掉这个打“内战”的根子，也就奠定了革命大联合的基石。

    “锅不热，饼不贴”
    对待有缺点和错误的同志，应当满腔热情地去关心他们，帮助他们，而不应当冷淡他们，歧视他们。俗话说：“锅不热，饼不贴”。要别人愿意靠拢我们，把心“贴”近我们，就得从我们心里发出使别人感到阶级友爱的温暖。假如，我们这口“锅”是冷冰冰的，怎么能使“饼”贴得上去呢？

    “一瞬”和“一生”
    英雄呂祥璧舍生救人英勇牺牲的一瞬间，来自英雄一生的刻苦锻炼。这一瞬间，是毛泽东思想抚育革命战士的结晶。人的一生，是由无数个“一瞬”累积而成的，无数鲜红的一瞬，才汇集成鲜红的一生。把自己生命的每一瞬，都用于刻苦学习毛泽东思想，在斗争中严格改造自己，不断破“私”立“公”，才能象吕祥璧那样，在那一瞬间放射出共产主义思想的耀眼光辉。
