According to Xinhua News Agency, Qingdao, July 24 - Qingdao's proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres are vigorously criticizing and exposing the capitalist roaders within the party, thoroughly criticizing and exposing the capitalist roaders within the party in Qingdao and Shandong. The revolutionary masses of Qingdao are following the instructions of Chairman Mao, and are criticizing and exposing the capitalist roaders within the party, thoroughly criticizing and exposing the capitalist roaders within the party in Qingdao and Shandong.

The revolutionary masses of Qingdao are following the instructions of Chairman Mao, and are criticizing and exposing the capitalist roaders within the party, thoroughly criticizing and exposing the capitalist roaders within the party in Qingdao and Shandong.

The revolutionary masses of Qingdao are following the instructions of Chairman Mao, and are criticizing and exposing the party's capitalist roaders, thoroughly criticizing and exposing the capitalist roaders within the party in Qingdao and Shandong. This unprecedented "people's war" has pushed the Cultural Revolution in Qingdao to a broader and deeper stage.

The proletarian revolutionary masses of Qingdao pointed out that the victory in the struggle for power is only the first step in the long march. The capitalist roaders within the party will not accept their defeat and will always try to stage a comeback to regain their lost "paradise." We must follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "pursuing the fleeing enemy with all our might" and relentlessly pursue and strike them down, thoroughly criticizing and exposing them politically, ideologically, and theoretically.

One characteristic of the revolutionary criticism movement in Qingdao is that the criticism of the capitalist roaders within the party is closely linked with the struggle, criticism, and reform in the local area, department, and unit, making the movement develop step by step. The Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Qingdao have long been promoting the revisionist line in Qingdao, attempting to restore capitalism. After the Cultural Revolution began, the capitalist roaders within the party in Qingdao, following the instructions of their master, stubbornly promoted the bourgeois reactionary line and fiercely sabotaged the Cultural Revolution. They created white terror, suppressed revolutionary masses; in personnel issues, they struck down a large number and protected a few. Since mid-May, the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres in the city have held twenty city-wide wired broadcast criticism meetings, concentrating firepower to comprehensively, systematically, and deeply expose and criticize the crimes of the capitalist roaders within the party and their agents in Qingdao against the party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought. The proletarian revolutionary masses in various districts, departments, and units of the city held multiple medium and small-scale criticism meetings based on the materials exposed at the city-wide criticism meetings, linking them with the struggle, criticism, and reform in their own units. In this way, the upper and lower levels are connected into a line, further exposing the reactionary face of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Qingdao—the capitalist roaders within the former Qingdao Municipal Party Committee—and further uncovering the cover of class struggle within the former Qingdao Municipal Party Committee and various districts, departments, and units in the city, making the broad revolutionary masses further recognize the origin and development of this revisionist black line and concentrate their deep hatred on the Chinese Khrushchev.

The proletarian revolutionary masses in the industrial, commercial, financial, educational, and cultural systems of the city recently held meetings to criticize the large number of revisionist goods promoted by the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Qingdao, and to eliminate their poison in various aspects. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs of Laoshan County have held multiple criticism meetings in the past month, fiercely exposing and criticizing the Chinese Khrushchev and the capitalist roaders within the former Laoshan County Party Committee for colluding with each other to promote the reactionary fallacies of "self-reliance, self-management, self-financing," "exploitation is meritorious," and "the extinction of class struggle" in the countryside, attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside.

Another characteristic of the revolutionary criticism movement in Qingdao is its wide-ranging mass participation, forming an unprecedented "people's war." Chairman Mao teaches us: "Organize tens of thousands of people, mobilize a vast revolutionary army, which is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolution." The proletarian revolutionary masses of Qingdao follow this brilliant teaching of Chairman Mao and, in the revolutionary criticism, mobilize the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres throughout the city to participate in the revolutionary criticism. They criticize verbally and in writing, with countless criticisms, making the capitalist roaders within the party fall into the encirclement of tens of thousands of revolutionary masses, forming a situation where "rats crossing the street are beaten by everyone."

The revolutionary criticism movement in Qingdao is conducted using a combination of large, medium, and small-scale criticism meetings and a combination of internal and external criticism meetings. During each city-wide criticism meeting, the live broadcast of the central venue is broadcast to the entire city via wired broadcast, allowing more people to participate in the battle. During the criticism meeting, the industrial, commercial, educational, judicial, and directly affiliated systems have eleven points simultaneously holding medium-scale criticism meetings; many grassroots units simultaneously hold small-scale criticism meetings within their own units. In this way, large, medium, and small-scale criticism meetings are conducted simultaneously, closely linked, and mutually promoting, pushing the criticism movement to deepen step by step.

The revolutionary criticism movement in Qingdao is powerfully promoting the revolutionary great alliance in Qingdao. Factories, enterprises, schools, and offices that have already achieved a great alliance of revolutionary masses are now further consolidating the alliance; some units that have not yet fully united are, in the revolutionary criticism, forming revolutionary organizations based on the spirit of seeking common ground while reserving differences, sitting together under the premise of a unified major direction, and criticizing the capitalist roaders within the party, creating favorable conditions for the great alliance.

In the revolutionary criticism, the proletarian revolutionary masses of Qingdao fiercely exposed and criticized the component of the bourgeois reactionary line in personnel issues, which was fabricated by the capitalist roaders within the party, "striking down a large number and protecting a few." The proletarian revolutionary masses firmly and unshakably implement Chairman Mao's personnel policy, using Mao Zedong Thought to educate cadres who have made mistakes, urging them to actively participate in the revolutionary criticism, stand up on the front line, and touch their souls deeply. Many cadres, in the criticism, further recognized the counter-revolutionary face of the capitalist roaders within the former Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the former Qingdao Municipal Party Committee, and stood up to fire back. In the twenty criticism meetings held throughout the city, more than 200 cadres who made mistakes wrote materials, and more than 70 cadres who made mistakes spoke, exposing the crimes of the capitalist roaders within the former Shandong Provincial Party Committee and the former Qingdao Municipal Party Committee. They expressed their determination to draw a clear line with the capitalist roaders within the party, with the bourgeois reactionary line, and with their own mistakes, and return to the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. Some cadres, after standing up, participated in the "three-in-one combination" temporary power organ of their unit after being discussed and agreed upon by the revolutionary masses.

The revolutionary criticism movement is the classroom for the proletarian revolutionary masses of Qingdao to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the criticism, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fight face-to-face with the class enemy. They study and understand the "May 16 Notification" and the "Sixteen Points" personally presided over and formulated by Chairman Mao, as well as a series of theories, lines, policies, and principles of the proletarian cultural revolution, and firmly implement them in the struggle. They say: among thousands of things and tens of thousands of things, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is the first thing. Studying Chairman Mao's works is higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. We must, in the criticism, thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology and thoroughly establish Mao Zedong Thought, using the great Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to fight down, fight over, and fight dirty the capitalist roaders within the party, and at the same time deeply touch our souls, criticize and reform our worldview. Currently, the proletarian revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of Qingdao are launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teaching: "Do not pity the snake-like evil people," and wield the thousand-catty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to thoroughly criticize, overthrow, and expose the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Qingdao politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and turn Qingdao into a red Mao Zedong Thought school.

    把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派彻底批倒批臭
    青岛放手发动群众投入革命的大批判
    口诛笔伐，万弹齐放，使中国赫鲁晓夫及其在山东、青岛的代理人，陷入重重包围中
    据新华社济南二十四日电　青岛市无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众高举革命的批判大旗，发扬痛打“落水狗”的彻底革命精神，正在掀起一个革命的大批判高潮，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在山东、青岛的代理人发动猛烈的总攻击。这场规模空前的“人民战争”，把青岛市无产阶级文化大革命运动推向了更加广阔、更加深入的阶段。
    青岛市广大无产阶级革命派指出，无产阶级革命派取得夺权斗争胜利，仅仅是万里长征走完了第一步。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派决不甘心于他们的失败，总是妄图卷土重来，夺回他们已经失去的“天堂”。我们必须遵照毛主席的“宜将剩勇追穷寇”的教导，穷追猛打，把他们从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批深、批透、批倒、批臭。
    青岛市革命的大批判运动的一个特点是，对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的批判，同本地区、本部门、本单位的斗批改上下挂钩，紧密结合，使运动的发展步步深入。中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在青岛的代理人，长期以来在青岛极力推行修正主义路线，妄图复辟资本主义。文化大革命开始后，青岛市党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派又秉承其主子的旨意，千方百计地顽固推行资产阶级反动路线，疯狂地破坏文化大革命。他们制造白色恐怖，镇压革命群众；在干部问题上，打击一大片，保护一小撮。从五月中旬以来，全市无产阶级革命派和革命群众，连续召开了二十次全市范围的有线广播批判大会，集中火力，全面地、系统地、深入地揭发和批判了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在青岛的代理人反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。市内各区县、各部门、各单位的无产阶级革命派根据全市批判大会揭发的材料，联系本部门、本单位的情况，分别召开了多次中型和小型的批判会，结合进行本单位的斗批改。这样，上下串成一条线，进一步揭露了中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在青岛的代理人——前青岛市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反动面目，进一步揭开了前青岛市委和市内各区县、各部门、各单位阶级斗争的盖子，使广大的革命群众进一步认清了这条修正主义黑线的来龙去脉，把深仇大恨集中到中国的赫鲁晓夫的身上。
    全市工交、财贸、文教、文艺等系统的无产阶级革命派，最近还陆续召开大会，批判中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在青岛的代理人大量推行的修正主义黑货，肃清他们在各方面的流毒。郊区崂山县的广大贫下中农，一个多月来，召开了多次批判会，狠揭狠批中国的赫鲁晓夫和前崂山县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派上下勾结，在农村推行“三自一包”，“剥削有功”，“阶级斗争熄灭论”等反动谬论，企图在农村复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。
    青岛市革命的大批判运动的另一特点是，具有广泛的群众性，形成了一场规模空前的“人民战争”。毛主席教导我们：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”青岛市无产阶级革命派遵循毛主席的这一英明教导，在革命的大批判中，放手发动全市广大革命群众和革命干部，投入革命的大批判。他们口诛笔伐，万弹齐放，使党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派陷入千千万万革命群众的包围之中，形成了“老鼠过街，人人喊打”的局面。
    青岛市革命的大批判运动，是采取大中小型批判会相结合、批判会内外相结合的方法进行的。在每次召开全市范围批判大会时，都用有线广播把中心会场的实况向全市广播，让更多的群众参加战斗。在批判大会进行期间，工交、财贸、文教、政法和直属机关等系统共有十一个点，同时分别召开中型批判会；许多基层单位，则同时召开本单位的小型批判会。这样，就作到了大中小型批判会交叉进行，紧密结合，互相推动，促进了大批判运动一步步深入地展开。
    青岛市革命的大批判运动，正在有力地推动着青岛市革命的大联合。原来已经实现了革命派大联合的工厂、企业、学校、机关，现在大联合进一步巩固了；一些原来还没有完全联合起来的单位，在革命的大批判中，群众组织也本着求大同存小异的精神，在大方向一致的前提下，坐在一块，联合批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为大联合创造了有利条件。
    在革命的大批判中，青岛市的无产阶级革命派，狠狠揭发和批判了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派炮制的在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线的组成部分。无产阶级革命派坚定不移地贯彻执行毛主席的干部政策，用毛泽东思想教育犯错误的干部，促使他们积极投入革命的大批判，在火线上亮相，狠触自己的灵魂。许多干部在大批判中进一步认清了前山东省委、前青岛市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反革命面目，纷纷起来大杀“回马枪”。仅在全市范围内的二十次批判大会上，就有二百多名犯错误的领导干部写了书面材料，七十多名犯错误的领导干部发了言，揭发前山东省委、前青岛市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行。他们表示，坚决同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界限，同资产阶级反动路线划清界限，同自己的错误划清界限，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。有些干部亮相后，经过革命群众讨论同意，已经参加了本单位“三结合”的临时权力机构。
    革命的大批判运动，是青岛市无产阶级革命派活学活用毛主席著作的课堂。他们在大批判中高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，同阶级敌人展开面对面的斗争。他们带着大批判中的问题，认真学习、努力领会毛主席亲自主持制定的一九六六年五月十六日《通知》、十六条，以及一系列的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，在斗争中坚决贯彻执行。他们说：千件事，万件事，活学活用毛主席著作是头一件事。学习毛主席著作高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切。我们要在大批判中，大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想，以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，斗倒、斗垮、斗臭党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，同时狠触自己的灵魂，破私立公，努力改造自己的世界观。目前青岛市的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，正在掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。他们决心遵照毛主席的教导：“决不怜惜蛇一样的恶人”，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在青岛的代理人，从政治上、思想上、理论上，彻底批倒、批垮、批臭，把青岛办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
