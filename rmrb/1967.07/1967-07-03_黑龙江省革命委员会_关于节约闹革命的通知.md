The Heilongjiang Revolutionary Committee

Notice on Frugality for the Revolution

Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 2—The Heilongjiang Revolutionary Committee issued a notice on frugality for the revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “Run factories, shops, and all state and cooperative enterprises frugally. Run all other enterprises frugally. Everything should follow the principle of frugality.” Increasing production and practicing frugality is a fundamental guideline for our socialist construction. In our province, the proletarian revolutionary faction and the broad masses, during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao’s call to “grasp revolution, promote production” and “practice frugality for the revolution.” They have grasped revolution, promoted production, practiced frugality, and achieved double victories in revolution and production. However, the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within our province’s Party have long resisted and sabotaged Chairman Mao’s policy of building the country through frugality. They have used various conspiratorial means to promote counter-revolutionary economism, engage in extravagance and waste, and push the revisionist line, attempting to sabotage the Cultural Revolution and restore capitalism. Therefore, frugality and extravagance are major issues of struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads. They are a fundamental manifestation of the opposition between the proletarian and bourgeois worldviews. The proletarian revolutionary faction that has seized power must fully recognize that the question of whether to increase production and practice frugality, or to engage in extravagance and waste, is a major issue concerning which road to take and where to go after seizing power. We must raise this issue to the level of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism. We must be highly vigilant and resolutely smash the various conspiracies of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. We must thoroughly eliminate the poison of their bourgeois reactionary line in economic construction, eliminate all extravagance and waste, and ensure that our Party’s fine tradition of hard struggle is further carried forward.

To better implement Chairman Mao’s great strategic line of “preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people,” and his call to “practice frugality for the revolution,” we must resolutely implement the notice from the Central Committee of the Communist Party, the State Council, the Central Military Commission, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group on further “grasping revolution and promoting production,” increasing income, and saving expenditures. The following notice is issued:

1. We must save manpower to the maximum extent. We must resolutely respond to Chairman Mao’s call to “grasp revolution, promote production,” put revolution in the first place, use revolution to lead production, and use revolutionary spirit to engage in production. The broad working class must fully play its leading role in revolution and production, adhere to the eight-hour workday, and complete production tasks with guaranteed quality. We must engage in revolution during spare time. We must not convene too many city-wide mass meetings. We must streamline personnel and reduce the number of non-production personnel as much as possible. We must voluntarily observe labor discipline, guard our production posts, and resolutely fight against all bad practices that disrupt production and violate labor discipline. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants must fully play their leading role, adhere to production during the day and revolution at night, and currently focus on summer weeding, agricultural infrastructure construction, and diversified operations. We must advance to the depth and breadth of production and strive for an all-around bumper harvest.

2. We must save materials by all means. In the Cultural Revolution and production construction, we must always, everywhere, and in everything pay attention to saving. We must widely carry out the campaign of using old and discarded materials. “We must not waste just for the moment.” Especially for coal, electricity, wood, and paper, we must carefully plan and allocate to save as much as possible and fully utilize these materials.

3. We must save transportation to the utmost. We must strictly prohibit the arbitrary use of transportation for parades. Broadcast cars assembled with production vehicles must be quickly dismantled, and all existing propaganda cars must be used for production and transportation.

4. We must strictly save fiscal expenditures. All organs, factories, enterprises, institutions, schools, revolutionary mass organizations, rural people’s communes, state farms, and collective production units must follow Chairman Mao’s great instruction to “save every copper coin for war and revolution, for our economic construction.” We must carry forward the fine tradition of frugality and hard struggle, greatly reduce various fiscal expenditures, and oppose embezzlement, theft, extravagance, and localism. We must strictly control administrative expenditures and expenses for office work, meetings, propaganda, and travel; even necessary fiscal expenditures must be strictly handled according to state financial systems and financial procedures.

Practicing frugality is not only an economic issue but also a major political issue. It is a major issue for the proletarian revolutionary faction to prevent peaceful evolution after seizing power. All levels of revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations must attach great importance to this and strengthen their work. The broad revolutionary workers, peasants, students, and cadres must, with a sense of responsibility as masters of the state, actively respond to Chairman Mao’s call to “practice frugality for the revolution,” thoroughly eliminate the poison of counter-revolutionary economism, and resolutely fight against all extravagant and wasteful practices.

    关于节约闹革命的通知
    新华社哈尔滨二日电　黑龙江省革命委员会关于节约闹革命的通知
    毛主席教导我们说：“勤俭办工厂，勤俭办商店，勤俭办一切国营事业和合作事业，勤俭办一切其他事业，什么事情都应当执行勤俭的原则。”增加生产，厉行节约，是我国社会主义建设的一条根本指导方针。我省无产阶级革命派和广大群众，在无产阶级文化大革命中，热烈响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”和“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，狠抓革命，猛促生产，厉行节约，夺取了革命生产的双胜利。但是，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和我省党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，长期抵制和破坏毛主席的勤俭建国方针，采取种种阴谋手段，大搞反革命经济主义，大搞铺张浪费，推行修正主义路线，妄图破坏文化大革命，复辟资本主义。因此，勤俭节约和铺张浪费，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的重大原则问题，是无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观根本对立的表现。掌了权的无产阶级革命派必须充分认识到，是增产节约、艰苦奋斗，还是铺张浪费、讲排场图阔气？这是关系到夺权以后走什么道路，向何处去的大问题。我们必须把这个问题提高到巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟的高度来认识。我们必须百倍提高警惕，坚决粉碎党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的种种阴谋诡计，彻底肃清其在经济建设方面的资产阶级反动路线流毒，杜绝一切铺张浪费和讲排场的现象，使我们党的艰苦奋斗的优良传统作风得到进一步发扬。
    为了更好地贯彻执行毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大战略方针，和“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，坚决贯彻执行中共中央、国务院、中央军委、中央文革小组关于进一步“抓革命，促生产”，增加收入，节约支出的通知，特作如下通知：
    一、要最大限度的节约人力。坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，把革命放在第一位，以革命统帅生产，用革命的精神进行生产。广大工人阶级，要在革命和生产中，充分发挥领导阶级的强大作用，坚持八小时工作制，保质保量地完成生产任务。坚持业余时间闹革命。不要过多地召开全市性的群众集会。要精兵简政，尽量减少脱产人员。要自觉地遵守劳动纪律，坚守生产岗位，坚决同破坏生产、违反劳动纪律的一切不良现象作斗争。广大的贫下中农要充分发挥主力军的作用，坚持白天搞生产，晚间闹革命，当前要集中力量搞好夏锄，搞好农田基本建设和多种经营，向生产的深度和广度进军，争取农业全面大丰收。
    二、要千方百计的节约物资。在文化大革命和生产建设中，要时时、处处、事事注意节约，广泛开展利旧利废活动，“决不可只顾一时，滥用浪费。”特别对煤、电、木、纸，更要精打细算，统筹安排，最大限度地节省使用，以充分发挥这些物资的应有作用。
    三、要尽力节约运输力量。严禁随便动用交通工具参加游行。用生产车辆装配的广播车要迅速拆除，要把现有的宣传车都用到生产运输上去。
    四、要严格节约财政开支。所有机关、工矿、企业、事业、学校、革命群众团体、农村人民公社、国营农场和集体生产单位，都要遵循毛主席“节省每一个铜板为着战争和革命事业，为着我们的经济建设”的伟大指示，发扬勤俭节约、艰苦朴素的优良传统，大力紧缩各项财政开支，反对贪污盗窃、铺张浪费和本位主义。严格控制行政支出和办公、会议、宣传、旅差等项费用；非用不可的财政支出，也要严格按照国家财政制度和财会手续办事。
    厉行节约不仅是经济问题，而且是一个重大的政治问题。是无产阶级革命派夺权以后防止和平演变的大问题。各级革命委员会和各革命群众组织必须高度重视，加强工作。广大的革命工农群众、革命师生和革命干部，要以国家主人翁的责任感，最积极地响应毛主席的“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，彻底清除反革命经济主义流毒，坚决向一切铺张浪费行为进行不调和的斗争。
                                一九六七年六月十八日
