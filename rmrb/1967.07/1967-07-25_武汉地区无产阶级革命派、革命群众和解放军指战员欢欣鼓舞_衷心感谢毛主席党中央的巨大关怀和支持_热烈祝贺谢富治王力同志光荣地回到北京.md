The proletarian revolutionary masses and PLA fighters in Wuhan are overjoyed and grateful for the great concern and support from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. They warmly celebrate the glorious return of Comrades Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li to Beijing.

Some members of conservative organizations either begin to realize that they were deceived and stood on the wrong side, or publicly declare their withdrawal from these conservative organizations.

A Xinhua News Agency report from Wuhan, July 24th: The news of Comrades Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li's glorious return to Beijing spread to Wuhan, making the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary people in Wuhan overjoyed and enthusiastic. They enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!" They said: The Central Committee sent Comrades Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li to Wuhan to handle the problems of the proletarian cultural revolution here, which is a great concern and support from the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group for the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan.

In many schools in Wuhan, the proletarian revolutionary fighters heard the news of Comrades Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li's glorious return to Beijing early in the morning of the 23rd, and immediately became excited. Students held celebrations and parades, shouting slogans like "Long live Chairman Mao!" Some proletarian revolutionary students said, "With the firm support of Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, the proletarian cultural revolution in Wuhan will definitely achieve a thorough victory, and the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan will definitely win. We revolutionary youths must follow Chairman Mao's words and always follow Chairman Mao." They shouted loudly, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Some had tears in their eyes and sang revolutionary songs like "The Ship Sails on the Sea Guided by the Helmsman" and "Father and Mother Are Not as Dear as Chairman Mao."

On major streets, many large trucks filled with PLA fighters joined the parade. They held up red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted slogans like "Firmly follow Chairman Mao!" "Firmly support the proletarian revolutionaries!" "Learn from the revolutionary youths!" The broad masses of PLA fighters in Wuhan also went to some schools to express their support and congratulations to the proletarian revolutionary fighters. The fighters waved red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to greet the revolutionary youths, who warmly applauded in welcome.

The broad masses of PLA fighters in Wuhan firmly stated that they would stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionaries, firmly support the proletarian revolutionaries, firmly protect the proletarian revolutionaries, and firmly unite and fight together with the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries, achieving victory together. Some leading organs and affiliated leftist support units of the Wuhan Military Region held grand rallies in their garrison squares on the 23rd. The fighters warmly celebrated the glorious return of Comrade Xie Fuzhi, the representative of the Party Central Committee, and Comrade Wang Li to Beijing, and sincerely thanked Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee for their concern and support for the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan.

Under the warm care of the Party Central Committee, the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan are full of vigor and high spirits. Some leaders of revolutionary organizations excitedly said, "The news of Comrades Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li's glorious return to Beijing is a great support for the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan and a great encouragement for the proletarian revolutionaries across the country." He said, "Chairman Mao is in our hearts. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao and carry the proletarian cultural revolution to the end! We will definitely act according to the instructions of our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, believe in and rely on the broad revolutionary masses, believe in and rely on the great People's Liberation Army of China, believe in and rely on the majority of cadres. We have the determination to carry out the proletarian cultural revolution in Wuhan to the end together with the great People's Liberation Army of China. The enemy will not be willing to fail, but as long as we firmly act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and the Party Central Committee's instructions, we will be invincible!"

Some members of conservative organizations either begin to realize that they were deceived and stood on the wrong side, or have already publicly declared their withdrawal from these conservative organizations.
