The flames of the armed struggle against violence by the Black people of Detroit are rapidly spreading to major cities. American Blacks are taking up arms to fight for freedom and liberation. A young Black American says: "Apart from rebellion, Blacks have no other way."

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 28th, the unprecedented armed struggle against violence by the Black people of Detroit and the wave of Black self-defense violence that has swept across dozens of American cities this summer have severely shaken the reactionary rule of American monopoly capital. Faced with the intensifying flames of the Black people's struggle against violence, the Johnson administration is attempting to extinguish them with even more brutal methods. However, this has not intimidated the Black masses who are full of fighting spirit.

The 5,000 federal paratroopers sent to Detroit to carry out suppression, along with 8,000 National Guardsmen and thousands of armed police, under the direct command of President's special envoy, former Deputy Secretary of Defense Vance and a general, on the 27th completely adopted a regular combat posture. They deployed tanks and armored vehicles to encircle the "riot zone" and used helicopters to fly over and shoot. Some Black snipers, despite the extremely unequal force, continued to fight until the 28th.

Inspired by the heroic spirit of the Black people of Detroit who are not afraid of violence and persist in their struggle, the armed struggle against violence by Blacks in South Bend, Indiana, San Francisco, Philadelphia, and cities such as Cincinnati, Toledo, and Dayton in Ohio entered their second and third days on the 27th. Cities like Passaic in New Jersey, which recently saw large-scale armed struggles against violence, Newark, Albany and Poughkeepsie in New York, and Seattle in Washington state, saw new Black struggles of varying scales on the 27th.

Faced with the thriving and burgeoning Black struggles, Johnson personally made a speech on the 27th to threaten and intimidate. He menacingly declared that he would "strongly, swiftly, and certainly" deal with the Black struggle against violence. To this end, he has instructed the Department of Defense to conduct "special training" on dealing with "riots" for the National Guard and appointed a so-called "special advisory committee" to consider measures to "prevent or suppress future (Black struggles against violence) disasters." At the same time, he announced that he would ask Congress to pass a series of fascist laws to deal with Blacks who are not afraid of violence.

The Johnson administration's savage face and brutal methods of suppressing the Black movement have, from the opposite side, deeply educated more and more American Blacks, greatly promoting their awakening. A new Black youth leader, Brown, who emerged in the struggle, on the same day that Johnson made his speech, at a press conference in Washington and a mass rally attended by more than a thousand Blacks, used powerful words to directly respond to Johnson's threat of violence. He said: "Blacks have an unshakable determination to demand freedom, and apart from rebellion, there is no other way." He particularly emphasized: "Violence is necessary," and Blacks must take up arms because the white rulers "respect nothing but the gun." His speech full of fighting spirit expressed the determination of the awakening Black masses to dare to rebel.

    美国黑人青年说：黑人除了造反以外，别无他法
    据新华社二十八日讯  华盛顿消息：规模空前的美国底特律黑人武装抗暴斗争的风暴，和今年夏季以来席卷了几十个美国城市的黑人暴力自卫斗争的滚滚浪潮，严重地冲击着美国垄断资本的反动统治。面对着黑人越烧越旺的抗暴斗争烈火，约翰逊政府妄图用更加残暴的手段扑灭下去。但是这并没有吓倒斗志旺盛的黑人群众。
    被派往底特律进行镇压的五千名联邦空降部队加上八千名国民警卫队和数千名武装警察，在总统特派代表、前国防部副部长万斯和一名将军的直接指挥下，二十七日完全按照正规作战的架势，出动坦克和装甲车把“骚乱区”团团围住，并出动直升飞机盘旋扫射。一些黑人狙击手在力量对比极端悬殊的情况下，直到二十八日为止仍在坚持战斗。
    在不畏强暴、坚持斗争的底特律黑人的英雄气概的鼓舞下，印第安纳州南本德市、旧金山、费城以及俄亥俄州的辛辛那提、托列多、德顿等城市的黑人抗暴斗争，在二十七日分别进入了第二天和第三天；而新泽西州的帕塞伊克和不久前爆发过大规模武装抗暴斗争的纽瓦克、纽约州的阿尔巴尼和波基普西、华盛顿州的西雅图等许多城市，在二十七日爆发了新的规模不等的黑人斗争。
    面临着如火如荼、蓬勃开展的黑人斗争，约翰逊二十七日再次亲自出马发表谈话进行威胁恐吓。他杀气腾腾地扬言，要
  “有力地、迅速地、肯定地对付”黑人抗暴斗争。为此，他已指示国防部对国民警卫部队进行关于对付“骚乱”的“特别训练”，并任命了一个所谓“特别谘询委员会”来考虑“防止或遏制将来的（黑人抗暴斗争）这种灾难”的措施。同时，他还宣布，他将要求国会通过一系列法西斯法案来对付不畏强暴的黑人。
    约翰逊政府镇压黑人运动的狰狞面目和残暴手段，从反面深刻地教育了越来越多的美国黑人，大大促进了他们的觉醒。在斗争中新涌现出来的美国黑人青年领袖布朗，在约翰逊发表谈话的同一天，在华盛顿举行的一次记者招待会上和一次有一千多名黑人参加的群众大会上，用有力的言词针锋相对地回答了约翰逊的暴力威胁。他说：“黑人具有要求自由的不可动摇的决心，而除了造反以外，别无他法。”他特别强调：“暴力是必要的”，黑人必须拿起枪来，因为白人统治者“除了尊重枪杆子以外，别的什么也不尊重”。他的富于战斗精神的讲话，表达出了正在觉醒中的广大黑人群众敢于造反的决心。
