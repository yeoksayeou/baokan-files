Editor's Note: All revolutionary mass organizations must unite and concentrate all efforts on the great criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. This is the overriding combat mission at present and the direction of struggle that must be firmly grasped.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is aimed at thoroughly criticizing and repudiating bourgeois ideology and establishing Mao Zedong Thought. Without thoroughly criticizing and repudiating various forms of bourgeois ideology, great Mao Zedong Thought cannot be established. As Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Without removal, there can be no flow. Without cessation, there can be no progress. Their struggle is a life-and-death struggle." Only through revolutionary criticism can the proletarian revolutionary forces solve this life-and-death struggle.

Look! These two revolutionary big-character posters say it so well: "The enemy never forgets to restore, so we must never forget the enemy and never forget to prevent restoration!" "With the enemy at our doorstep, we have a thousand and one reasons to unite!" Although there are various contradictions among the proletarian revolutionary forces, compared with the contradictions with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, they are insignificant. Small reasons must be subordinated to big reasons. For the better conduct of revolutionary criticism and for the better completion of the great historical tasks of struggle, criticism, and reform, the proletarian revolutionary forces must indeed form a vast revolutionary army! Revolutionary comrades! Let us join hands closely and create new achievements and establish new merits in the revolutionary criticism!

Serious Combat Mission, Major Historical Mission

Red Revolutionary Alliance, Peking Normal University Jian Mountain Commune

Raise the banner of proletarian revolutionary criticism higher, carry forward the spirit of "beating a fallen dog," concentrate targets and wisdom, and launch a larger-scale, more profound, and more extensive criticism against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with China's Khrushchev as the representative. This is a great revolutionary movement to thoroughly bury revisionism in China, a great ideological revolutionary movement for the Chinese proletariat to defeat the bourgeoisie, a fundamental measure to prevent revisionism; it is the wise decision and great strategic deployment of the great leader Chairman Mao; it is a serious combat mission and a major historical mission facing the proletarian revolutionary forces and the broad masses of the people.

Revolutionary criticism is the guiding principle for all our work at present.

Revolutionary criticism is the sole direction of struggle at present.

Revolutionary criticism is the fundamental content of resuming classes and making revolution.

Revolutionary criticism is the great struggle and decisive battle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, between the socialist road and the capitalist road. This is related to the success or failure of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and it is related to the future of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

Revolutionary criticism is the greatest state affair, the greatest proletarian politics. The attitude towards the criticism of China's Khrushchev is the attitude towards Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Not engaging in revolutionary criticism is a wrong direction and line, a betrayal of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of China's Khrushchev, although defeated by us, still harbors ambitions. The revisionist poison they spread among the broad masses of the people has not been thoroughly cleansed, their ideology as a class still exists, and they are constantly watching for opportunities to stage a comeback, attempting to rise again. However, some weak-willed individuals in our revolutionary ranks are complacent about past achievements, thinking they are "dead tigers" and do not need to be beaten anymore; worse still, they think the revolution has been victorious and have abandoned the spirit of hard struggle, indulging in luxury and forgetting class struggle altogether. If this trend continues, the fruits of the revolution will inevitably be lost. There are also those who, considering themselves old revolutionaries and old rebels, do not see the big picture or consider the overall situation, are eager to engage in "internal warfare," and regard trivial issues as more important than anything else. In serious class struggle, they cannot unite and fight the enemy together. Such people still pride themselves on their principled stance, but in fact, they do not engage in great criticism, precisely because they have abandoned the greatest principle. What they have is not the principled stance of the proletariat, but the narrow-mindedness and sectarianism of the petty bourgeoisie. Toward such people, we must shout at them: "Comrade, what you are doing is not beneficial to the proletarian revolutionary cause, and if you continue, you will fall!"

"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining strength and not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." Let us raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher, emphasize proletarian politics, overcome the vacillation of the petty bourgeoisie, strengthen the revolutionary, scientific, and disciplined nature of the proletariat, with a high sense of revolutionary responsibility and a combative posture, and devote ourselves fully to this revolutionary criticism. Let us carry forward the revolutionary spirit of Mr. Lu Xun's "beating a fallen dog," thoroughly bury the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and ensure that our ironclad proletarian state remains unshakable for generations to come!

### 严重的战斗任务，重大的历史使命

专栏：革命大字报选

    编者按：一切革命群众组织联合起来，集中全力投入对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，这是当前压倒一切的战斗任务，这是必须牢牢掌握的斗争大方向。
    无产阶级文化大革命，就是要大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想。不大破形形色色的资产阶级思想，伟大的毛泽东思想就立不起来。正象毛主席教导我们的：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行，它们之间的斗争是生死斗争。”无产阶级革命派只有通过革命的大批判，才能解决这个生死斗争的大问题。
    请看！这两张革命的大字报说得何等好啊！“敌人念念不忘复辟，我们就要念念不忘敌人，念念不忘反复辟！”“大敌当前，我们有一千条一万条理由联合起来。”无产阶级革命派之间尽管存在着这样那样的矛盾，但是比起同党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾来，却是微不足道的。小道理被大道理管着，小道理要服从大道理。为了更好地进行革命的大批判，为了更好地完成一斗二批三改的伟大的历史任务，无产阶级革命派确实到了组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军的时候了！革命的战友们！让我们紧密地携起手来，在革命的大批判中创新功，立新劳吧！
    严重的战斗任务，重大的历史使命
    红代会北京师范大学井冈山公社
    更高地举起无产阶级的革命批判大旗，发扬“痛打落水狗”的精神，集中目标，集中智慧，向以中国的赫鲁晓夫为代表的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开更大规模、更为深刻、更为广泛的大批判，这是一场在中国彻底埋葬修正主义的伟大革命运动，这是一场我国无产阶级战胜资产阶级的伟大的思想革命运动，这是反修、防修的根本措施；这是伟大领袖毛主席的英明决策、伟大的战略部署；这是摆在我们无产阶级革命派和广大人民群众面前的一个严重的战斗任务，重大的历史使命。
    革命的大批判就是当前我们一切工作的纲。
    革命的大批判就是当前唯一斗争的大方向。
    革命的大批判就是复课闹革命的根本内容。
    革命的大批判是无产阶级和资产阶级、社会主义道路和资本主义道路的大搏斗、大决战。这是关系到无产阶级文化大革命成败的关键，是关系到中国革命和世界革命事业前途的关键。
    革命的大批判是最大的国家大事，是最大的无产阶级政治。对待中国的赫鲁晓夫的批判的态度问题就是对毛主席革命路线、战无不胜的毛泽东思想的态度问题。不搞革命的大批判，就是方向路线的错误，就是对无产阶级革命事业的背叛。
    中国赫鲁晓夫一伙反革命修正主义分子虽然被我们打倒了，但是他们人还在心不死，他们在广大人民群众中散布的修正主义流毒还远未肃清，他们的思想作为阶级的思想还存在，他们每日每时都在窥测方向，伺机反扑，妄图东山再起。而我们革命队伍中的一些意志薄弱者，却躺在过去的成绩上睡大觉，认为他们是“死老虎”了，不用再打了；更有甚者，认为革命已经胜利，就丢掉了艰苦奋斗的作风，讲排场比阔气，阶级斗争忘得一干二净。这样发展下去，革命胜利果实就非被葬送不可。还有一些人以老革命老造反自居，不识大体，不顾大局，热中于打“内战”，把枝节问题看得比天还大，在严重的阶级斗争情况下，不能团结起来，共同对敌。这种人还以原则性最强而自居，其实他们不搞大批判，恰恰是丢掉了最大的原则。他们有的，不是无产阶级的原则性，而是小资产阶级的狭隘性和宗派主义。对于这种人，我们必须向他大喝一声：“同志，你这样做对无产阶级革命事业是不利的，发展下去是要倒台的。”倘若我们看不到全局，缺乏政治远见，忘记主要的阶级敌人，那就会被他们所利用，那就会犯历史性的错误。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”让我们更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，克服小资产阶级的摇摆性，加强无产阶级革命性、科学性、纪律性，以高度的革命责任感，以战斗的姿态，全力以赴地投入到这场革命的大批判中去，发扬鲁迅先生“痛打落水狗”的革命精神，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派彻底埋葬，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，使我们铁打的无产阶级江山千秋万代永不变色！
