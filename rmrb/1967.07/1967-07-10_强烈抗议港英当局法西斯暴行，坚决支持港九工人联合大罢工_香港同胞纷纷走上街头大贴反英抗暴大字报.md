According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 9th: Hong Kong youth students, New Territories farmers, and other patriotic compatriots from various strata took to the streets from morning to evening on the 8th. In more than ten areas of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories, they held parades, mass rallies, and street performances to strongly protest the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities in their mad persecution of Hong Kong patriots, and to resolutely support the joint strike of Hong Kong and Kowloon workers.

In the morning of the 8th, residents of six places in the New Territories—Shatoujiao, Sai Kung, Taipo, Yuen Long, Tsing Shan, and Tsuen Wan—held mass rallies and parades to strongly protest the mad persecution of Hong Kong patriots by the Hong Kong British authorities, and the bloody suppression of local residents and students in the Shatoujiao and Taipo districts. They resolutely expressed their full support for the joint strike of Hong Kong and Kowloon workers, determined to widely unite patriotic compatriots in the New Territories, forming a vast anti-imperialist, anti-violence army in the New Territories to thoroughly settle the scores with the Hong Kong British for their heinous crimes committed over the past seventy years, and prepare to join hands with patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon at any time to smash British imperialism to smithereens.

At the denunciation meetings, the residents of the New Territories were filled with indignation, repeatedly shouting slogans such as "Protest the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British!" "Blood for blood!" "Down with British imperialism!" "The Hong Kong British will be defeated, we will be victorious!" They also enthusiastically cheered, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live, long live, ten thousand times long live our great leader Chairman Mao!" After the meeting, the villagers of Sai Kung and Yuen Long districts held up Chairman Mao's quotations and anti-British, anti-violence slogans, parading and demonstrating in the nearby villages, continuously shouting slogans, and posting anti-British, anti-violence slogans and big-character posters everywhere.

In the afternoon of the 8th, more than 1,300 young students and patriotic compatriots from other strata held parades in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon.

In the heart of Kowloon, the Mong Kok district, the parade began at noon. A parade of more than 200 patriotic employees from the Shaw Brothers Film Studio, workers from the Poly American Yacht Factory, patriotic film workers, and patriotic theater employees set off from the "Elizabeth Youth Center," marching down Nathan Road in a grand parade. They held up a huge banner with the words "Blood for blood!" and shouted slogans along the way, posting anti-violence big-character posters and anti-violence slogans on the streets.

As the parade of workers and patriotic film workers passed by, a parade of more than 300 patriotic young students also arrived on Nathan Road. They held up a huge banner with the words "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!" and marched forward in victory. Slogans such as "Protest the illegal arrest of patriotic students by the Hong Kong British!" "We will be victorious, the Hong Kong British will be defeated!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" echoed through the streets. The parade wrote anti-violence big-character slogans on the streets with paint and posted anti-violence big-character posters on the "American Bank" building.

The two parades were spirited and full of fighting spirit. Wherever they went, the crowd cheered and shouted enthusiastically, and many people followed the parade, shouting slogans together.

In the North Point district of Hong Kong, a parade of more than 400 patriotic young students held up a large red banner with the words "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" Chairman Mao's quotations, and anti-violence slogans, marching from east to west. The parade posted anti-British, anti-violence big-character posters along the way, shouting slogans such as "Down with the Hong Kong British imperialism!" "Blood for blood!" "Long live the great unity of all patriotic students in Hong Kong!" and singing heroic revolutionary songs. The grand parade was warmly welcomed by the crowd along the way, and many people shouted, "Long live the great unity of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon!" When the parade reached the door of the Hua Feng National Goods Company, the patriotic employees held up a banner with the words "Salute to the patriotic teachers and students fighting against British imperialism!" and cheered the brave actions of the patriotic students.

In the Sai Wan district of Hong Kong, more than 400 patriotic young students held a parade on Sai Wan Street. The parade also pasted slogans reading: "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the great unity of all workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon!" "The Hong Kong British will be defeated, we will be victorious!" "We vow to fight down and expose the Hong Kong British!" on the doors and walls of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation branch and the Standard Chartered Bank.

In the afternoon and evening of the 8th, four teams of young students performing arts troupes held street performances in the Western, Central, and Eastern districts of Hong Kong. The audience continuously applauded and cheered for these fighting art programs.

The broad patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong defied the Hong Kong British "emergency regulations," surging onto the streets to engage in various anti-British, anti-violence activities, greatly boosting the morale of the patriotic compatriots and striking a heavy blow to British imperialism. The broad patriotic compatriots were very excited and expressed their determination to take further action, join the ranks of the anti-British, anti-violence struggle, form a vast army, and give British imperialism a heavy blow.
