The Hong Kong British authorities, who have not yet settled their numerous blood debts to the people of Hong Kong, deliberately and premeditatedly committed another bloody atrocity on July 9 in the Western District of Hong Kong, shooting and injuring our compatriots.

On the afternoon of July 9, the Hong Kong *Wen Wei Po* and *Ta Kung Pao* jointly published an extra edition reporting that the Chinese Foreign Ministry had lodged the strongest and most urgent protest with the British government over the British authorities' bloody suppression of residents in Sha Tau Kok. Many workers and students voluntarily took the extra editions to the streets to distribute. At around 5:30 PM, three "riot control" vehicles suddenly arrived near Fukien Middle School in the Western District of Hong Kong. As soon as dozens of "riot control" officers jumped out of the vehicles, they frenziedly attacked the crowd and arrested a student from Fukien Middle School who was distributing the extra editions. A patriotic compatriot bravely rushed forward to rescue the student, and nearby residents also gathered to help. The fascist thugs, driven by their savage nature, opened fire on the crowd. According to the Hong Kong British radio, one person was killed on the spot, and two were injured, one of whom later died in the hospital. Several other people were also arrested.

The crimes of the Hong Kong British fascist police enraged the onlookers and residents of nearby buildings, who threw stones and glass bottles at the police cars. The thugs hurriedly fled in their vehicles. According to the Hong Kong "Information Services Department," one Hong Kong British police officer was killed during the crowd's self-defense counterattack. Later, the parents of the arrested student and representatives from Fukien Middle School went to the Western District Police Station to protest and demand the immediate release of the arrested student. The Fighting Committee of Fukien Middle School and the Student Fighting Committee of Fukien Middle School issued a joint statement that night, demanding that the Hong Kong British authorities immediately accept the three conditions proposed by the Chinese Foreign Ministry and immediately release the arrested student.

On the same afternoon, the Hong Kong British fascist authorities also deployed several hundred "riot control" officers to suppress the people in the North Point and Wan Chai districts of Hong Kong. In front of the New China Goods Company in Wan Chai, a British police officer shot and injured a young man. The fascist thugs provocatively attacked patriotic institutions in the North Point area, injuring a patriotic worker. The crowds gathered in these areas did not retreat in the face of the enemy's suppression. They fought bravely against the fascist thugs in the streets for about seven hours.

    港英当局又欠我一笔血债
    香港爱国同胞愤怒抗议英帝打死打伤我同胞新罪行
    据新华社香港十日电　港英法西斯当局欠下香港中国人民的累累血债未偿，九日在香港西区又有计划、有预谋地制造了新的血腥暴行，开枪打死打伤我同胞。
    九日下午，香港《文汇报》和《大公报》出版联合号外，报道我外交部就港英当局血腥镇压沙头角居民事件向英国政府提出最紧急、最强烈的抗议。许多工人、学生自动拿号外到街上散发。下午五时半左右，三车“防暴队”突然开到香港西区福建中学附近，数十名“防暴队”一跳下车便疯狂追打群众，逮捕了一名正在散发号外的福建中学学生。一名路过的爱国同胞奋勇上前抢救，附近群众也围集前来，法西斯暴徒凶性大发，竟开枪向群众扫射。据港英电台供认，当场打死一人，打伤两人，其中一名伤者稍后在医院死去。另外还逮捕了一些群众。
    港英法西斯警察的罪行激起在场群众和附近住宅楼宇居民的无比愤怒，纷纷向警车投掷石块、玻璃瓶，暴徒慌忙爬上警车逃跑。据港英“新闻处”透露，有一名港英警察在愤怒的群众进行自卫还击时被击毙。稍后，被捕学生的家长和福建中学师生代表前往西区警署抗议，限令立刻释放被捕学生。福建中学斗委会和福建中学学生斗委会当天晚上发表联合声明，限令港英当局立即接受我外交部提出的三项条件，并立即释放被捕学生。
    同天下午，港英法西斯当局还出动几百名“防暴队”在香港北角和湾仔地区进行血腥镇压。在湾仔新中华国货公司前面，一个英国警官开枪打伤一名青年。法西斯暴徒猖狂地向北角区的爱国机构挑衅，打伤一名爱国职工。集结在这些地区的群众，在敌人镇压面前，毫不退缩，他们在街上同法西斯暴徒展开了约七个小时的英勇斗争。
