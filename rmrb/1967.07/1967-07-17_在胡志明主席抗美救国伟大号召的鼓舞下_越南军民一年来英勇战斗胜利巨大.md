Under the great call of Chairman Ho Chi Minh to resist America and save the country, the Vietnamese military and people have achieved great victories in one year of heroic struggle.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, July 16th – Our correspondent reports: Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to resist America and save the country, issued on July 17th last year, has powerfully inspired the Vietnamese people's armed forces to completely defeat the American aggressors. They regard the Chairman's call as a battle cry and a guarantee of victory. In the past year, they have fought bravely on all fronts and achieved great victories.

After the publication of Chairman Ho's "Call to Arms," an unprecedented revolutionary spirit emerged among the broad masses of soldiers, cadres, and militia self-defense corps. Everyone was full of vigor and fighting spirit. Despite the fact that American imperialism has intensified its bombing of Hanoi, Haiphong, and other places in North Vietnam, it has not shaken the iron will and determination of the heroic Vietnamese people to resist America and save the country. Under the inspiration of Chairman Ho's great call, the military and people of North Vietnam have achieved new glorious feats. They have shot down nearly 900 American aggressor planes and annihilated or captured a large number of American pilots. The artillery units of the people's army and the militia self-defense corps, in their counterattacks against American and puppet pirates and in their punishment of American and puppet forces south of the demilitarized zone, have damaged American warships 50 times, sunk three patrol boats, annihilated thousands of American invaders, and destroyed many cannons and other weapons.

Air force soldier Hu Van and his comrades carry Chairman Ho's call to resist America and save the country with them every time they take off to intercept the enemy. He said, "We are determined to avenge our country and people, to fight alongside all the people's armed forces, and to fight alongside the heroic people of the South, to shoot down more enemy planes, annihilate more enemies, and completely defeat the American aggressors." His words express the common will of all the Vietnamese military and people.

The military and people of North Vietnam firmly remember Chairman Ho's teachings in the "Call to Arms" to "not fear hardship and sacrifice, and to fight resolutely to final victory." Their revolutionary heroism has been highly manifested in the battle. The drivers of the First Transportation Company of the Fourth Military Region, such as Suu Vuong and Vu Thuan Chung, created a record of safe driving for 20,000 to 30,000 kilometers under the heavy bombing of the enemy. Driver Nguyen Manh, with one hand injured, continued to drive with the other. Vu Thuan Chung, whose gasoline truck was hit and caught fire, called the assistant driver to put out the fire while he continued to drive the truck, skillfully avoiding the enemy planes and safely reaching the destination.

A certain engineering company is responsible for repairing a section of the road that has been bombed over 500 times in five months, with the enemy dropping 6,000 bombs here. The soldiers of the engineering company work day and night, regardless of sun and rain, to fill in the bomb craters and remove the timed bombs and unexploded bombs, ensuring the smooth flow of traffic. Female soldier Nguyen Thi Lu of the Fifth Engineering Company alone removed 50 bombs. When comrades asked her why she was so brave, she replied, "Chairman Ho teaches us not to fear hardship and sacrifice. Removing bombs is always dangerous, but as long as I think that by removing the bombs, vehicles can pass through smoothly, weapons and ammunition can be delivered to the front line, and enemies can be annihilated, even if I myself am unfortunately sacrificed, it is nothing."

The female militia platoon of a certain commune in Ninh Binh Province is responsible for defending and repairing a section of the road. Since last July, American planes have bombed here every day, but vehicles still pass through. The sisters think of Chairman Ho's call and are full of energy. The deputy commander of the militia in this commune, Tan Thi Huong, said, "My father is the commander of the commune militia. The predecessors fought against the invaders, and the later generations will also follow the example of our fathers and fight against the enemy. One generation after another, we will continue to fight until we drive the American aggressors out of our country."

At present, all the people's armed forces in North Vietnam, with deep hatred for the American aggressors, are fighting more brilliantly, resolutely implementing Chairman Ho's great call to resist America and save the country.

    在胡志明主席抗美救国伟大号召的鼓舞下
    越南军民一年来英勇战斗胜利巨大
    新华社河内十六日电　本社记者报道：胡志明主席去年七月十七日发出的抗美救国伟大号召，极其有力地鼓舞了越南各人民武装力量彻底战胜美国侵略强盗的钢铁意志。他们把胡主席的号召看成是冲锋的号角，胜利的保证，一年来在各条战线上英勇战斗，取得了巨大胜利。
    胡主席的《号召书》发表后，在广大人民军战士、干部和民兵自卫队员当中出现了从未有过的蓬蓬勃勃的革命气势，人人意气风发，个个斗志昂扬。一年来，尽管美帝国主义疯狂地加强了对越南北方河内、海防等地的轰炸，但丝毫不能动摇英雄的越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志和决心。在胡主席伟大号召的鼓舞下，越南北方军民立下了新的辉煌战功。共击落了美国强盗飞机近九百架，消灭和活捉大批美国飞贼。人民军炮兵部队和民兵自卫队在还击美伪海盗和惩罚在军事分界线南部的美伪军的战斗中，共击伤美国军舰五十艘次，击沉别动艇三艘，歼灭上千名美国侵略军，击毁许多大炮和其他武器。
    空军战士胡文和他的战友们每次起飞迎击敌人时，身上都带着胡主席的抗美救国《号召书》。他说：“我们决心报家仇，雪国恨，同各人民武装力量一道，同英雄的南方军民一道，击落更多的敌机，消灭更多的敌人，彻底打败美国侵略者。”他的话，表达了全体越南军民的共同意志。
    越南北方军民牢牢地铭记着胡主席在《号召书》中“不怕艰苦、牺牲，坚决战斗到彻底胜利”的教导，他们的革命英雄主义精神在战斗中得到高度发扬。第四军区运输第一连的司机苏有全、武顺宗等创造了在敌机狂轰滥炸下安全行车二万到三万公里的纪录。司机阮猛滥一只手被炸伤，他就用另一只手坚持驾驶。武顺宗运载的汽油被击中起火，他叫副司机灭火，他继续驾驶汽车，机智地躲开敌机，安全地到达了目的地。
    某工兵连负责维修的一段公路，在五个月中被炸过五百次，敌机在这里投下了六千枚炸弹。工兵连的战士们不分昼夜，不顾日晒雨淋，及时把弹坑填上，把定时炸弹和没有爆炸的炸弹清除，保证了交通线畅通无阻。工兵第五连女战士阮氏瑠一个人清除了五十枚炸弹。同志们问她为什么这样勇敢，她回答说：“胡主席教导我们要不怕艰苦，不怕牺牲。清除炸弹随时都可能发生危险，但是只要一想到把炸弹清除了，车辆就能顺利通过，武器和子弹能及时运到前方，消灭敌人，我自己就是不幸牺牲了，也算不了什么。”
    宁平省某乡的女民兵排负责保卫和维修的一段公路，从去年七月起，美国飞机没有一天不来轰炸，可是车辆照样通行。姐妹们一想到胡主席的号召，就浑身是劲。这个乡的民兵副队长谭氏香说：“我父亲是乡民兵队长，前辈抗击侵略者，后一代也要跟着父兄打敌人，一代接着一代，一直打到把美国侵略强盗赶出我们国土为止。”
    目前，越南北方各人民武装力量，怀着对美国侵略强盗的深仇大恨，正在进行更加出色的战斗，坚决实现胡主席发出的抗美救国伟大号召。
