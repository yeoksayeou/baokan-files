	To the brave news warriors, we extend our heartfelt greetings!

	The All-China Journalists Association and Xinhua News Agency have separately sent telegrams to Xue Ping and other detained patriotic journalists.

Dear Comrade Xue Ping and other detained, brave, and patriotic journalists:

	Over the past two months, the British colonial authorities in Hong Kong have carried out inhuman fascist and bloody suppression against our patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, which has sparked immense indignation among the 400 million patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and the 700 million people of China. In this brave struggle against British imperialism and violence, you have made significant contributions and fulfilled your duties.

	The British fascist authorities in Hong Kong, while you were conducting normal reporting activities, ordered the military police and thugs to beat and illegally arrest you, and even conducted illegal "interrogations" and "trial." This is a serious political provocation against our great socialist motherland, and a serious political provocation against the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We express our utmost indignation. Facing the batons, guns, and prisons of the British fascist authorities in Hong Kong, you remained unyielding, stood tall, and fought back resolutely, exposing the ugly face of the British fascist authorities and shaking their arrogance. You have shown the heroic spirit of the Chinese people and are truly red journalists of Chairman Mao. Here, we salute you in combat and express our deepest sympathies!

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They appear terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power." Behind you, firmly supporting you, are the great 700 million people of our motherland and journalists across the country, as well as all revolutionary people and journalists from various countries around the world. Victory will surely be yours.

	We believe that you will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, "Resolutely determine to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory." Journalists across the country will resolutely fight alongside you, carry on the struggle against oppression, and will not rest until we achieve complete victory. Those who will be judged are definitely the British fascist authorities!

	With proletarian cultural revolution greetings!

	To the brave warriors in the anti-imperialist struggle, dear Comrade Xue Ping:

	We have learned that the British fascist authorities in Hong Kong have shamelessly "sentenced" you to two years in prison and will continue to illegally interrogate two other journalists from our branch and five other patriotic journalists. The entire revolutionary staff of Xinhua News Agency are filled with immense anger!

	In the enemy's court, you remained steadfast and, with great revolutionary heroism, condemned and exposed the crimes of the British fascist authorities in suppressing Chinese compatriots and kidnapping our journalists, putting forward four solemn demands. With your fearless actions, you have actually passed judgment on the British authorities!

	We salute you! We learn from you! And we extend our warmest greetings!

	The British fascist authorities in Hong Kong and the British Labour Party government are so madly provoking the great 700 million people of China and so savagely suppressing the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong. This does not show their strength but rather their weakness, indicating that they are in the throes of a counter-revolutionary death struggle. The more their atrocities escalate, the more the wave of patriotic resistance will surge. The handful of imperialists in Hong Kong and Kowloon and their die-hard lackeys who are willing to die for imperialism will definitely not escape their doom. The entire revolutionary staff of Xinhua News Agency, together with the people of the entire country, will hold high the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, vowing to be your strong backing, vowing to be the strong backing of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, and resolutely fight against the British authorities in Hong Kong to the end, not resting until we achieve complete victory!

	"The Chinese nation has the spirit to fight to the end with its enemies." As long as we remember the great teachings of Chairman Mao, resolutely determine to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory, fearing neither sacrifice nor hardship, fighting bravely and advancing fearlessly, ultimate victory will surely be ours.

	The British fascist authorities, who have done so many evil deeds, will ultimately face the people's just judgment!

    向英勇的新闻战士致以最亲切慰问
    全国记协和新华社分别致电薛平和其他被捕爱国记者亲爱的薛平同志和其他被捕的英勇斗争的爱国新闻界同志们：
    最近两个多月以来，港英当局对我香港爱国同胞进行了惨无人道的法西斯血腥镇压，激起了我香港四百万爱国同胞和七亿中国人民的无比愤慨。你们在这场英勇的反英抗暴斗争中，作出了贡献，尽到了你们应尽的责任。
    港英法西斯当局竟在你们进行正常采访活动时，指使军警和暴徒对你们进行殴打和非法逮捕，甚至进行非法“审讯”和“判决”。这是港英法西斯当局对我们伟大社会主义祖国的严重政治挑衅，是对用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民的严重政治挑衅。对此，我们表示极大的愤慨。面对港英法西斯当局的警棍、刀枪、监狱，你们面不改色，大义凛然，坚贞不屈，和他们展开了针锋相对的斗争，使港英法西斯当局丑态百出，威风扫地。你们表现了中国人民的英雄气概，不愧是毛主席的红色新闻战士。在这里，我们谨向你们致以战斗的敬礼，并向你们表示深切的慰问！
    毛主席教导我们说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。”在坚决支持着你们的，有伟大的七亿祖国人民和全国新闻工作者，有全世界一切革命的人民和各国革命新闻工作者。胜利一定是属于你们的。
    相信你们一定能够更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”全国新闻工作者坚决同你们一道，把反迫害斗争进行到底，不获全胜，决不罢休。将要受到审判的，必定是港英法西斯当局！
    致以无产阶级文化大革命敬礼！
                    中华全国新闻工作者协会
                      一九六七年七月二十一日香港分社转反帝斗争的英勇战士、亲爱的薛平同志：
    获悉港英法西斯当局悍然“判决”您入狱两年，并将继续非法审讯我分社另两名记者及其他五名爱国记者，我们新华通讯社全体革命同志感到无比愤怒！
    在敌人的法庭上，您坚贞不屈，以大无畏的无产阶级英雄气概，谴责和控诉了港英法西斯当局镇压中国同胞和绑架我记者的罪行，提出了四项严正要求。您以大无畏的行动，实际上对港英当局作了严厉的审判！
    我们向您致敬！向您学习！并致以最亲切的慰问！
    港英法西斯当局和英国工党政府如此疯狂地向伟大的七亿中国人民挑衅，如此野蛮地镇压香港中国同胞，这并不说明它们的强大，相反，只说明他们的虚弱，表明他们正在进行反革命的垂死挣扎。它们的暴行越升级，爱国同胞的抗暴斗争的浪潮必将越加汹涌澎湃地发展。港九一小撮帝国主义者及其死心塌地为帝国主义殉葬的走狗们，绝对逃不脱覆灭的命运。我们新华通讯社全体革命同志和全国人民一道，高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，誓作你们的强大后盾，誓作香港爱国同胞的强大后盾，坚决同港英当局斗争到底，不获全胜，决不罢休！
    “我们中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概”。只要我们牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导，下定决心，不怕牺牲，不怕困难，前赴后继，英勇奋战，最后胜利一定是我们的。
    坏事做尽的港英法西斯当局最终必将受到人民的正义判决！
                               新华通讯社全体革命同志
                                    一九六七年七月二十一日
