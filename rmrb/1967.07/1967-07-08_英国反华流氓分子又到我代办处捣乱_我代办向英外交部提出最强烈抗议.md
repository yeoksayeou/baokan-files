A small group of hooligans, masquerading under the banner of the British "Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament," again caused trouble at the Chinese Liaison Office in London on the evening of July 4. They even publicly burned copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung," a book cherished by revolutionary people all over the world. This is a new and serious political provocation against the great Chinese people, instigated by British imperialism.

On the evening of July 4, with the connivance of the British police, a small group of anti-China hooligans from the "Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament" came to the door of the Chinese Liaison Office. They were acting in accordance with the needs of the U.S.-British imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leaders. They came to "protest" the successful explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb, which has brought joy to people all over the world. A few of these hooligans even tore up and burned copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Tse-tung," a revolutionary treasure loved by all revolutionary people around the world and a powerful weapon against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

The staff of the Chinese Liaison Office, who have boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, immediately rushed out to stop the hooligans' shameful acts and obtained evidence of their crimes on the spot.

The staff of the Chinese Liaison Office solemnly pointed out that their hooligan behavior does not in the least damage the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, but only exposes the ugly faces of all imperialists and reactionaries who fear Mao Zedong Thought. The staff warned them: the great Chinese people are not to be trifled with, and all anti-China elements will meet a bad end!

On the morning of July 5, Chinese Chargé d'Affaires Shen Ping lodged the strongest protest with the British Foreign Office over this anti-China provocation instigated by British imperialism.

Just as billions of people around the world are enthusiastically celebrating the successful explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb, the U.S.-British imperialists, modern revisionists, and all reactionaries are terrified and enraged by this great victory achieved by the Chinese people under the guidance of the great and invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Under the connivance of the British government and the incitement of its official propaganda machine, a small number of anti-China elements from the London "Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament" had previously caused trouble and provoked incidents at the Chinese Liaison Office on June 18 and June 27. However, they were all sternly rebuked by the staff of the Chinese Liaison Office.

　　英国反华流氓分子又到我代办处捣乱
　　我代办向英外交部提出最强烈抗议
    新华社伦敦五日电 打着英国“裁减核军备运动”旗号的一小撮流氓挑衅分子四日晚再次到中国驻英国代办处前面挑衅，甚至公然烧毁全世界革命人民最心爱的宝书《毛主席语录》。这是英帝国主义策动的一次新的、严重的反对伟大中国人民的政治挑衅事件。
    四日晚，在英国警察的纵容下，“裁减核军备运动”的一小撮反华流氓分子，适应美英帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团的需要，来到中国代办处门前，“抗议”全世界人民为之欢欣鼓舞的中国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功。其中几个流氓竟然当场撕毁并焚烧了全世界革命人民最心爱的革命宝书——反对帝国主义、修正主义和反动派的强有力武器《毛主席语录》一本。
    对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的中国代办处工作人员，立即冲出门外，制止流氓们的无耻罪行，并且当场取得了他们的罪证。
    中国代办处工作人员严正指出，他们这种流氓行为丝毫无损于伟大的、战无不胜的毛泽东思想，而只能暴露一切帝国主义和反动派害怕毛泽东思想的丑恶嘴脸。中国代办处人员警告他们：伟大的中国人民不是好惹的，一切反华分子都不会有好下场！
    中国驻英国临时代办沈平五日上午就英帝国主义蓄意制造的这次反华挑衅事件向英国外交部提出最严重、最强烈的抗议。
    正当全世界亿万人民热烈欢呼中国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功的时候，美英帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派对中国人民在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下取得的这一伟大胜利怕得要命，恨得要死。在英国政府纵容和官方宣传机器的煽动下，伦敦“裁减核军备运动”的少数反华分子曾经先后在六月十八日和二十七日到中国代办处捣乱和挑衅，但是都遭到中国代办处工作人员的严正训斥。
