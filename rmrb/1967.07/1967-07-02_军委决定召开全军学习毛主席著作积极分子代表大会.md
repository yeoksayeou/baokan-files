The Military Commission decides to hold the national conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works

The General Political Department in its notice pointed out: This meeting is one that Vice Chairman Lin has long instructed to be held. Holding such a conference will not only greatly promote the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in our army, helping to build our army into a more proletarian and more combat-ready revolutionary army, but will also have a significant impact on the nationwide mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and on the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought around the world.

Xinhua News Agency, July 1st: The Central Military Commission has decided to hold the national conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the spring of next year. Recently, the General Political Department of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued a notice regarding the relevant matters of holding this conference.

The notice states: The Central Military Commission has decided to prepare for the national conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the spring of next year. This is a highly significant event in the history of our army's construction. In this era, Marxism-Leninism has developed to the stage of Mao Zedong Thought, and the world has entered a great new era of Mao Zedong Thought. Holding such a conference in our army will not only greatly promote the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in our army, helping to build our army into a more proletarian and more combat-ready revolutionary army, but will also have a significant impact on the nationwide mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and on the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought around the world.

The notice points out that this conference is one that Vice Chairman Lin has long instructed to be actively held, and it is the first national conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works. This conference will conduct a major review and summary of the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works that has been launched across the army since the establishment of the new Military Commission, especially since Vice Chairman Lin's call last year to raise the study of Chairman Mao's works to a new level. This conference will introduce the experiences of our army's cadres and soldiers in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in breaking down selfishness and establishing public spirit, carrying out ideological revolutionization, creating exemplary companies, strengthening war preparedness, defending national defense, and completing various tasks over the past few years; it will particularly highlight the experiences of actively participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, resolutely implementing and defending the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, thoroughly criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, and completing the great task of supporting the local areas in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works over the past few years. This conference is a major event for promoting the study and application of Chairman Mao's works, exchanging advanced experiences, and praising advanced individuals, units, and deeds. These will greatly promote and elevate the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in our army and the successful completion of various tasks. Therefore, all levels of leadership must widely publicize the great significance of this conference to the troops, promote a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and seriously carry out preparatory work to ensure the conference is a success.

The notice requires that the conference delegates must be politically reliable, have a firm stance, and be revolutionary leftists of the proletariat; they must study for the revolution and work hard on applying what they have learned, and have truly good results in transforming their thoughts and improving their work, and have relatively high prestige among the masses.

The notice provides specific regulations on the conditions and selection methods for conference delegates, the number of delegates, and the submission of materials.
