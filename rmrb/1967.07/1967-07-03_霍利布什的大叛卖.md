The recent visit of Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin to the United States, where he held a lengthy secret meeting with Johnson in Glassboro, resulted in the so-called "Spirit of Glassboro." This is the most blatant collusion yet between the traitorous clique led by Brezhnev and Kosygin and American imperialism, and it is the most despicable betrayal of the peoples of the world.

This is also a concentrated exposure of the reactionary essence of the Soviet revisionist clique following the Middle East incident, which is very beneficial for people around the world to see the true face of the Soviet revisionists.

The talks between Kosygin and Johnson marked the complete failure of the Soviet revisionist clique's deceptive policy of pseudo-anti-imperialism, pseudo-support, and pseudo-revolution.

The U.S.-Soviet talks were held while the gunpowder smoke from the Middle East battlefield had not yet dissipated. The instigator of the war of aggression, American imperialism, was being hunted down like a rat crossing the street. The Soviet revisionist clique, which had betrayed the Arab people, was also infamous and cursed everywhere. However, under these circumstances, Kosygin dared to rush into Johnson's embrace without hiding from the world. This fully shows how eager and impatient the Soviet revisionist clique is to collude with, rely on, and serve American imperialism. It also clearly exposes how shameless and disgusting their various pretenses have been.

The talks between Kosygin and Johnson marked a new stage in U.S.-Soviet collusion, with the Soviet revisionist clique completely bowing down to American imperialism and playing a supporting role in the counter-revolutionary "holy alliance" with American imperialism as its leader.

If the Soviet revisionist clique had long dreamed of so-called "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to rule the world," Khrushchev had once done his utmost to strive for equality with American imperialism, then now his disciples are willingly serving under American imperialism as obedient henchmen and slaves. They are even more subservient to American imperialism, bowing their heads and listening to orders. For this reason, the Kosygin clique is even more suitable for American imperialism's needs and has received more praise and admiration from the big bosses on Wall Street.

Kosygin's great betrayal in Glassboro was met with applause in the United States and the Western world. Johnson proudly declared: "This is an important and historic meeting." American and Western public opinion, with hearts full of satisfaction and excitement, greatly hyped up the talks as having "achieved unexpected success," "exceeded expectations," showing that the U.S. and the Soviet Union were "sincerely meeting," "had the fundamental will to reach an agreement," and "had laid the foundation for future changes in substantive issues," and that "human affairs were about to have a new beginning."

Washington and Western public opinion were so excited because the Soviet revisionist clique had completely shown its hand to American imperialism in these talks. In Johnson's words, it was "a better understanding of each other." This means that the U.S. is more confident in the Soviet revisionists, more certain that they can do a big favor and do a lot of work for them, playing a role that others cannot.

The talks between Kosygin and Johnson also reflected the extreme weakness of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists, reflecting their common fear of the revolutionary movements of the peoples of the world.

The so-called "Spirit of Glassboro" emerged entirely out of the common interests of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism in counter-revolution. In the face of intensifying international class struggle and surging revolutionary movements of the peoples of the world, the days of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists are getting harder and harder. The aggressive and war policies of the Johnson administration are failing everywhere and are surrounded by the peoples of the world. The Soviet revisionist clique is increasingly decaying and declining, rapidly going downhill, and is also in a situation of internal and external difficulties. Therefore, U.S. imperialism needs to utilize the Soviet revisionists even more, and the Soviet revisionists need to rely on U.S. imperialism even more. The two must further collude to unite all reactionary forces in the world to deal with the revolutionary forces of the world and save their doomed fate.

Through the Glassboro talks, U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists coordinated and cooperated on a global strategic level. They not only made deals on this or that issue but also engaged in a comprehensive package deal; they not only colluded on issues in this or that region but also cooperated in all fields on a global scale. In this way, the Soviet revisionist clique's so-called "U.S.-Soviet cooperation to rule the world" has been more closely linked with the counter-revolutionary global strategy of American imperialism, and the Soviet revisionists' foreign policy has been further incorporated into the orbit of American imperialism's global strategy.

Through the Glassboro talks, U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists jointly plotted counter-revolutionary conspiracies to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, especially the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America. During the talks, Johnson openly shouted: "The two great powers can set an example for other countries in avoiding conflicts." Kosygin followed suit: "All over the world, wars must stop," "the situation must not be allowed to escalate," and "no one must cause trouble." The two of them, singing and dancing together, were nothing but international gendarmes.

Through the Glassboro talks, U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists reached basic agreement on many major international issues and reached new agreements and tacit understandings. After the talks, Kosygin pretended to emphasize that there were "disagreements" between the U.S. and the Soviet Union on this or that issue, which was nothing but a smokescreen.

A common basis for the collusion between the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialism is that they both regard the Chinese people as their number one enemy. Before the Glassboro talks, the Soviet revisionist clique issued a resolution against China in the name of the Central Committee of the CPSU; after the talks, Kosygin publicly attacked China for conducting hydrogen bomb tests. It was under the joint planning and instigation of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists that the reactionaries of various countries followed suit, launching a small wave of anti-China sentiment.

This meeting further proved that the U.S.-Soviet alliance is a thoroughly anti-communist, anti-people, anti-revolutionary, and anti-China alliance.

The Soviet revisionist clique's betrayal of the peoples of the world and pursuit of U.S.-Soviet cooperation is not a new phenomenon. Since Khrushchev came to power, the Soviet revisionist clique has made this its national policy and has been obsessed with "meeting" with U.S. presidents. From Camp David to Glassboro, the Soviet revisionist clique has traveled a path of increasing betrayal and degeneration.

In 1959, after Khrushchev's talks with Eisenhower, the Soviet revisionist clique greatly publicized the "Spirit of Camp David," trying to beautify American imperialism, worsen Sino-Soviet relations, split the international communist movement, and betray the national liberation struggle in the Congo (Kinshasa). They touted the Camp David talks as a "new era in international relations," which was actually the beginning of the shameful history of the open collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union against world revolution.

In 1961, after Khrushchev's talks with Kennedy, the so-called "Vienna Spirit" emerged. Soon after this meeting, the Soviet revisionist clique issued a thoroughly revisionist "program," fiercely attacking Albania, and in coordination with Kennedy's "peace strategy," sabotaged the national liberation struggle of the people of Indochina. A year later, the Caribbean crisis occurred, and Khrushchev begged for mercy from American imperialism. At the same time, Khrushchev supported the Indian reactionaries' attack on China. This showed that the so-called "Vienna Spirit" was the Soviet revisionist clique's open surrender to American imperialism and intensified betrayal of the Chinese people and the peoples of the world.

In 1963, while suspending Sino-Soviet party talks, the Soviet revisionist clique signed the Partial Nuclear Test Ban Treaty with the U.S. and Britain in Moscow and again hyped up the so-called "Moscow Spirit." The Soviet revisionist clique shamelessly fully implemented its four-link, four-anti policy: aligning with imperialism against socialism; aligning with the U.S. against China; aligning with the reactionaries of various countries against the peoples of the world; aligning with the Tito clique and all kinds of traitors against Marxist-Leninist parties. The so-called "Moscow Spirit" was the Soviet revisionist clique's complete and final reversal of the enemy-friend relationship, openly forming a counter-revolutionary "holy alliance" with U.S.-led imperialism and the reactionaries of various countries.

Now, the talks between Kosygin and Johnson are a new milestone in the Soviet revisionist clique's path of betrayal. Since Kosygin and his gang came to power, they have faithfully inherited and greatly developed Khrushchev's revisionist counter-revolutionary line. This Glassboro talk is the total exposure of the countless betrayals they have committed in the past two years, a concentrated manifestation of their decision to follow the orders of U.S. imperialism and suppress the revolutionary peoples of the world. This talk is also a political gamble by this small group of traitors and strike-breakers in their desperate situation to save their own fate.

The so-called "Spirit of Glassboro," stripped of its disguise, is the Soviet revisionist clique's open and shameless oath of allegiance to U.S. imperialism, the Judas spirit of unprecedented betrayal of the interests of the peoples of the world, the prince spirit of relying on the imperialist boss to maintain their own small court, and the thorough counter-revolutionary spirit of persistently opposing the Soviet people and the peoples of the world.

The Soviet revisionist clique is a gang of incorrigible traitors. They will inevitably become more and more frenzied in their opposition to the Soviet people and the peoples of the world. They betray once, expose once, and after being exposed, they betray again until they perish. This is the inevitable logic of traitors.

In the Glassboro talks, the Soviet revisionist clique threw away even the tattered remnants of their cover, making it clearer to people that this small group of traitors and strike-breakers has rotted to the core. As Lenin pointed out when denouncing the Second International revisionist parties, "In it, the disgusting sores have festered and given off a foul stench." From now on, no matter what beautiful words the Soviet revisionist clique says or what disguises it puts on, it will be even harder to believe.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "All aggressors and their running dogs will be buried, and the time will not be long. They are definitely not going to escape."

The counter-revolutionary collusion between U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists will not only fail to stop the advance of the wheel of history and save their own doom but will only accelerate their steps toward the grave.

The tide of world revolution is surging and surging. It will break through all barriers and roll forward. Whether it is U.S. imperialism or the Soviet revisionists, they will all be buried by the revolutionary tide.

　　霍利布什的大叛卖
　　观察家
    苏修头目柯西金最近跑到美国，同约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗举行了长时间的秘密会谈，弄出了一个什么“霍利布什精神”。这是以勃列日?夫和柯西金为首的叛徒集团上台以来，同美帝国主义进行的一次最露骨的勾结，是他们对全世界人民进行的一次最肮脏的叛卖。
    这也是继中东事件之后，苏修集团反动本质又一次集中的大暴露，对于全世界的人们看清苏修的真面目，有很大的好处。
    柯西金同约翰逊的会谈，宣告了苏修集团乔装改扮，惨淡经营的假反帝、假支持、假革命的欺骗政策彻底破产。
    美苏这次会谈，是在中东战场上的硝烟还没有散失的时候举行的。侵略战争的元凶美帝国主义，正象过街老鼠，人人喊打。而出卖了阿拉伯人民的苏修集团，也声名狼藉，到处挨骂。但是，就在这种情况下，柯西金竟然不避世人耳目，一头栽到约翰逊的怀里。这充分表明，苏修集团勾结美帝、投靠美帝、效忠美帝，已经到了何等心急情切、迫不及待的地步。这也就清楚地暴露了，他们所一贯玩弄的种种装腔作势的假姿态，是多么虚伪无耻，令人作呕。
    柯西金同约翰逊的会谈，标志着美苏勾结进入了一个新的阶段，苏修集团完全拜倒在美帝国主义的脚下，在以美帝国主义为盟主的反革命“神圣同盟”中充当配角。
    如果说，苏修集团梦寐以求的是所谓“苏美合作主宰世界”，赫鲁晓夫曾经竭尽所能同美帝国主义力争平起平坐，那么现在，他的门徒已经心甘情愿地在美帝国主义的麾下，做一名驯顺的帮凶和奴仆。他们对美帝国主义更加奴颜婢膝，俯首贴耳。正因为这样，柯西金之流比赫鲁晓夫更加适合美帝国主义的需要，得到了华尔街大老板更多的夸奖和称赞。
    柯西金在葛拉斯堡罗的大叛卖，在美国和西方世界引起了一片喝采声。约翰逊自鸣得意地宣称：这是一次“重要的、具有历史意义的会议”。美国和西方舆论带着满意和兴奋的心情，大肆渲染这次会谈“取得了意外的成功”，“超过了人们的期望”，表明了美苏两家“倾诚相见”，“存在着达成协议的根本意志”，“已经为未来在实质性问题上的变化奠定了基础”，“人类的事务即将有新的开端”。
    华盛顿和西方舆论所以这样兴高采烈，就是因为苏修集团在这次会谈中向美帝国主义完全交了它的底。用约翰逊的话来说，就是“彼此有了更好的了解”。这就是说，美帝对苏修是更放心了，更加看准了苏修可以为自己帮大忙，效大劳，起别人所不能起的作用。
    柯西金同约翰逊的会谈，还反映了美帝苏修的极端虚弱，反映了它们两家对于世界人民革命运动的共同的恐惧。
    所谓“霍利布什精神”的出现，完全是出于美帝和苏修反革命的共同利害关系的需要。在国际阶级斗争日趋激烈，世界人民革命运动日益高涨的形势下，美帝和苏修的日子越来越不好混。约翰逊政府的侵略政策和战争政策到处失败，陷入了世界人民包围之中。苏修集团越来越衰朽没落，急剧地走下坡路，也处于内外交困的境地。因此，美帝就更加需要利用苏修，苏修也就更加需要投靠美帝，它们两家必然要进一步勾结起来，联合世界上一切反动力量，来对付世界革命力量，挽救其灭亡的命运。
    通过葛拉斯堡罗会谈，美帝和苏修在全球战略上进行了全面的协调和配合。他们不仅仅在这个或那个问题上做交易，而且是搞的一揽子买卖；不仅仅是在这个地区或那个地区的问题上进行勾结，而且是在全世界范围的各个领域通盘合作。这样，苏修集团的所谓“苏美合作主宰世界”的总路线就同美帝国主义的反革命全球战略更紧密地挂上了钩，苏修的对外政策进一步纳入了美帝国主义全球战略的轨道。
    通过葛拉斯堡罗会谈，美帝和苏修共同策划了镇压世界各国人民革命斗争，特别是亚非拉民族解放运动的反革命阴谋。在会谈期间，约翰逊公开叫嚷：美苏“两大国可以为其他国家在避免冲突方面做出榜样”。柯西金跟着呐喊：世界各地都要“停止战争”，“不让局势有任何尖锐化”，不许任何人“引起纠葛”。两个家伙有唱有和，一句话，就是不准反抗侵略，不准人民革命，完全是一副国际宪兵的嘴脸。
    通过葛拉斯堡罗会谈，美帝和苏修在当前许多重大国际问题上取得了基本方针上的一致，达成了新的协议和默契。会谈以后，柯西金故作姿态地强调什么苏美之间在这个那个问题上有“分歧”，无非是照例施放的烟幕。
    苏修同美帝互相勾结的一个共同基础，就是他们都把中国人民当作头号敌人。葛拉斯堡罗会谈前，苏修集团以苏共中央名义抛出了一个反华决议；会谈后，柯西金又公开攻击中国进行氢弹试验。正是在美帝苏修的共同策划和挑动下，各国反动派群起效尤，掀起了一阵小小的反华浪潮。
    这次会谈更加清楚地证明，苏美联盟，是一个彻头彻尾的反共、反人民、反革命、反中国的联盟。
    苏修集团背叛世界人民，追求美苏合作，当然不自今日始。自从赫鲁晓夫上台以来，苏修集团就以此为国策，而且着了迷似地热中于同美国历届总统“会晤”。从戴维营到霍利布什，苏修集团经历了一条越来越卑鄙、越来越堕落的叛卖道路。
    一九五九年，赫鲁晓夫同艾森豪威尔会谈以后，苏修集团大肆宣扬“戴维营精神”，极力美化美帝国主义，恶化中苏关系，分裂国际共产主义运动，出卖刚果（金）的民族解放斗争。他们鼓吹戴维营会谈是什么“国际关系新纪元”，实质上就是苏美公开合伙反对世界革命的罪恶历史的开端。
    一九六一年，赫鲁晓夫同肯尼迪会谈，又出现了所谓“维也纳精神”。这次会谈以后不久，苏修集团就抛出了彻头彻尾的修正主义“纲领”，大反阿尔巴尼亚，并且配合肯尼迪的“和平战略”，破坏印度支那人民的民族解放斗争。一年以后，发生加勒比海危机事件，赫鲁晓夫向美帝国主义屈膝求饶。与此同时，赫鲁晓夫还支持印度反动派进攻中国。这些表明，所谓“维也纳精神”，也就是苏修集团公开投降美帝国主义，加紧反对中国人民和世界人民的叛卖活动。
    一九六三年，苏修集团在中断中苏两党会谈的同时，在莫斯科同美英签订了部分禁止核试验条约，又大肆鼓吹所谓“莫斯科精神”。苏修集团肆无忌惮地全面推行它的四联四反政策：联合帝国主义，反对社会主义；联合美国，反对中国；联合各国反动派，反对世界人民；联合铁托集团和形形色色的叛徒，反对马克思列宁主义政党。所谓“莫斯科精神”，也就是苏修集团把敌友关系彻底地最终地颠倒过来，公开同以美国为首的帝国主义和各国反动派结成反革命“神圣同盟”。
    现在柯西金同约翰逊的会谈，是苏修集团在叛卖道路上越走越远的一个新的路标。柯西金及其一伙上台以来，忠实地继承了并且大大地发展了赫鲁晓夫修正主义的反革命路线。这次葛拉斯堡罗会谈，是他们两年多来所干的无数叛卖勾当的总暴露，是他们决心听从美帝指挥，镇压世界革命人民的反动面目的集中表现。这次会谈，也是这一小撮叛徒和工贼集团在日暮途穷的情况下，为了挽救自己的命运所进行的一场政治赌博。
    所谓“霍利布什精神”，拆穿了说，就是苏修集团公开无耻地向美帝宣誓效忠的奴才精神，就是对全世界人民利益实行空前大叛卖的犹大精神，就是依附帝国主义头子来维持自家小朝廷的儿皇帝精神，就是坚持与苏联人民和全世界人民为敌的彻头彻尾的反革命精神。
    苏修集团是一伙不可救药的叛徒。他们必然要越来越疯狂地反对苏联人民和世界人民。他们叛卖一次，就要暴露一次，暴露之后，还要叛卖，直到灭亡。这是叛徒的必然逻辑。
    苏修集团在葛拉斯堡罗会谈中，把一点点破烂不堪的遮羞布也丢得一干二净，使人们更清楚地看到：这一小撮叛徒和工贼集团已经坏透了。正象列宁痛斥第二国际修正主义政党时所指出，在它“身上，令人噁心的毒疮已经化脓，并散发出一股难闻的尸臭”。从今以后，苏修集团无论再说什么漂亮话，再搞什么伪装，就更难使人相信了。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“世界上一切侵略者及其走狗，通通都要被埋葬掉，为期不会很远。他们一定逃不掉的。”
    美帝和苏修的反革命勾结，不但不能阻止历史车轮的前进，挽救自己的灭亡，而只会加速他们走向坟墓的步伐。
    世界革命的潮流波澜壮阔，汹涌澎湃。它将冲决一切堤坝，滚滚向前。什么美帝，什么苏修，都将被革命的怒涛所埋葬。
