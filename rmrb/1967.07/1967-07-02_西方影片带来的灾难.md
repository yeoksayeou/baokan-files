Western films, peddled by the Soviet revisionist ruling clique on Soviet screens, have become rampant. A U.S. film titled "It's a Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World" was shown in forty-two cinemas in Moscow last year. The mad, adventurous, murderous, and robber characters in Western films have become role models for many Soviet youths. Someone once wrote in the *Soviet Culture News* that many children committed crimes after watching films depicting murder. For example, in Barnaul, juvenile delinquents told the police that they had committed crimes by imitating the methods of the director in the film "Green Mansions." A U.S. film titled "The Magnificent Seven," which depicts a murder case, once caused a sensation in the Soviet Union. *Soviet Culture News* revealed that after this film was shown, "many people imitated the protagonist of the film. This spring, all the fights that occurred were influenced by 'The Magnificent Seven'..."

However, *Soviet Culture News* published an article praising the success of this film. Some viewers severely criticized this film, but the author of *Soviet Culture News* shamelessly said, "Why not think about it: Why did 'The Magnificent Seven' cause such a strong reaction? Perhaps there is some secret in the film that can produce a strong response, which can be used for our purposes and tasks."

　　西方影片带来的灾难
    在苏联的银幕上，苏修统治集团大肆贩卖的美、英、法、意等西方国家的影片，泛滥成灾。一部美国影片，名曰《这是疯狂、疯狂、疯狂的世界》，去年就曾在莫斯科四十二家影院放映过。西方影片中的发狂、冒险、杀人、抢劫的人物，成了许多苏联青少年模仿的榜样。有人曾在《苏维埃文化报》上发表文章说，许多孩子就是在看了描写行凶杀人的影片以后犯罪的。例如，在巴尔瑙尔，少年罪犯对民警机关的工作人员说，他们是模仿电影《绿街小舍》的导演制定的方法犯了罪。有一部名叫《七好汉》的描写凶杀案的美国影片，曾经在苏联“轰动”一时。《苏维埃文化报》透露，在这部影片上映之后，“不少人纷纷仿效影片的主人公。今年春天发生斗殴的事，无一不是受了《七好汉》的影响……”
    但是，《苏维埃文化报》竟发表文章，吹捧这部影片的“成功”。有些观众对这部影片提出了严厉的批评，但是，《苏维埃文化报》的作者竟恬不知耻地说什么“怎么不想一想：《七好汉》为什么引起了如此剧烈的反应？也许在影片中有着某种能产生强烈反响的、可以用到我们需要的目的和任务上的秘密。”
