Palestinian refugees forcibly expelled from their homes in the Gaza Strip on July 13 angrily denounced U.S. support for its tool of aggression, Israel, for forcibly occupying their homes and brutally massacring Palestinian civilians. They declared their determination to "fight their way back home!" A Palestinian worker said, "We Palestinians would rather die for our homeland than surrender to the enemy. Our only way out is to take up arms and fight."

On July 13, a reporter from Xinhua News Agency met with thousands of Palestinians who were driven out of the Gaza Strip by Israeli invaders in a refugee camp in the Liberated Province of the United Arab Republic. They angrily recounted to the reporter that many innocent Palestinians, including women, children, and the elderly, were killed by Israeli Zionists. The property of the Palestinian people was looted, and many houses, hospitals, and schools were destroyed. Fearing attacks by the Palestinian people, the Israeli invaders forced more than 6,000 Palestinian youths to leave their homes at gunpoint.

A Palestinian journalist who worked at the Gaza *Palestine News* and fought as a member of the National Guard in Khan Yunis against the Israeli invaders recounted the heroic struggles of the Palestinian people.

He said, "Although the Israeli air force used napalm to support their ground attacks in Khan Yunis and the Gaza region, our military and civilians fought bravely against them. Tens of thousands of Palestinian youths fought alongside the Palestinian Liberation Army and the UAR army, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. After the war began, we held out in Gaza for four days, killing more than a thousand Israeli invaders, destroying about sixty enemy tanks and fifty military vehicles, and shooting down four Israeli planes."

Many Palestinian refugees expressed their gratitude to the Chinese people for their support. A Palestinian student said, "During the war, we knew that the Chinese people held massive demonstrations in support of our struggle. This gave us great encouragement." He asked a Chinese friend for a Chairman Mao badge and shouted, "Long live the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao Zedong! Long live the true friend of the Palestinian people, the People's Republic of China!"

    感谢中国人民支持他们反对美帝走卒以色列的斗争
    新华社开罗十四日电  被迫离开加沙地带家园的巴勒斯坦难民，十三日愤怒谴责美帝支持它的侵略工具以色列强占他们的家园，野蛮屠杀巴勒斯坦平民的罪行。他们表示决心“打回老家去！”一位巴勒斯坦工人说：“我们巴勒斯坦人宁愿为祖国而死，也决不向敌人投降。我们唯一的出路就是拿起武器战斗。”
    新华社记者十三日在阿联解放省的难民营会见了被以色列侵略军赶出加沙地带的几千名巴勒斯坦人。他们向记者愤怒地控诉说，许多无辜的巴勒斯坦人，其中包括妇女、儿童和老人，被以色列犹太复国主义者杀害了。巴勒斯坦人民的财物被抢劫一空。许多房屋、医院和学校遭到破坏。以色列侵略者由于害怕巴勒斯坦人民的袭击，用枪口强迫六千多名巴勒斯坦青年离开他们的家园。
    一位在加沙《巴勒斯坦消息报》工作、并作为国民自卫队员在汉尤尼斯同以色列侵略军战斗的巴勒斯坦新闻工作者，叙述了巴勒斯坦人民英勇战斗的事迹。
    他说：“尽管以色列飞机使用凝固汽油弹来配合他们在汉尤尼斯和加沙地区对我们发动的地面进攻，但是我国军民同他们进行了英勇的战斗。成千上万的巴勒斯坦青年同巴勒斯坦解放军以及阿联军队一起参加了战斗，给敌人造成了沉重的损失。战争开始后，我们在加沙坚守了四天，打死了一千多名以色列侵略者，击毁了大约六十辆敌人坦克和五十辆军车，击落四架以色列飞机。”
    许多巴勒斯坦难民表示感谢中国人民对他们的支援。一位巴勒斯坦学生说：“在战争期间，我们知道中国人民举行了声势浩大的示威游行，支持我们的斗争。这给了我们极大的鼓舞。”他向中国朋友索取毛主席像章，并高呼：“世界人民的伟大领袖毛泽东万岁！”“巴勒斯坦人民的真正朋友人民中国万岁！”
