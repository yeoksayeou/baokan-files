The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Jinan Weaving Factory, through the revolutionary criticism movement, united the majority of the masses and the majority of the cadres, and worked together to promote revolution and production. From January to June this year, they overfulfilled the plan every month and completed the entire first half of the year's state task ten days ahead of schedule. The production level in July continued to improve.

The Jinan Weaving Factory originally produced ordinary cotton cloth. This year, according to the state's requirements, it switched to producing canvas. This change brought many difficulties to production: more than 80% of the equipment needed to be modified; there was a shortage of labor, and the technical operations were not suitable. When a small clique of those taking the capitalist road were in power in the factory, they did not actively study how to overcome the difficulties to accept this new task but instead tried to use the opportunity to add machinery and equipment, expand the factory buildings, and increase the staffing.

However, when they learned that some sister factories had been trying to weave canvas for more than a year without passing the quality inspection, they simply dropped the task.

After the proletarian revolutionary faction seized power in January, they accepted the task of weaving canvas without adding new equipment or expanding the factory buildings.

They realized from their own experience that to improve production, they must first focus on the revolution. They launched a movement to criticize China's Khrushchev and closely linked it with the problems in their factory, exposing and purging the revisionist poison spread by the small clique of those taking the capitalist road within the factory. The broad masses thus further realized that the small clique of those taking the capitalist road in the factory had, in accordance with the intentions of China's Khrushchev to restore capitalism, used money to corrupt the working class and attempted to lead the socialist enterprise onto the path of capitalist enterprise. Their intentions were extremely malicious, and the consequences were extremely serious. Therefore, only by purging their poison and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide everything, promoting the revolutionization of people's thinking, could production truly be promoted.

The proletarian revolutionary faction also realized that without the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers in the entire factory, not only would the revolution not be successful, but production would also not be successful. Therefore, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings of "from the masses, to the masses" and handed over this year's production tasks to the entire factory's workers for discussion. They revealed the importance of the tasks and the existing problems to the masses and required the masses to exert their enthusiasm and creativity. As a result, the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary workers to promote revolution and production surged. They resolutely declared: "Revolution after work, production during work, ensuring quality and high output." The workers proposed many good ideas and came up with many good methods. Workers and technical personnel combined their efforts, day and night, repeatedly experimenting with and modifying the machines. The masses voluntarily organized to learn new operating techniques and established technical inspection teams.

Seeing the enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers to promote revolution and production, the revolutionary faction felt even more strongly the importance of uniting the majority of the masses and the majority of the cadres. They addressed some ideological tendencies within the revolutionary faction and conducted a rectification campaign. After the proletarian revolutionary faction came to power, some comrades did not pay attention to implementing Chairman Mao's teachings on "policy and strategy being the lifeblood of the party" and were not patient in doing ideological and political work with the deceived masses.

Through the open rectification campaign, the proletarian revolutionary faction overcame the wrong ideological tendencies within their ranks and, at a workers' meeting, made self-criticisms for some excessive actions of the revolutionary faction in the past.

From then on, the proletarian revolutionary faction adopted the method of persuasion and education to unite the vast majority of the masses and work together with them in revolution and production.

For cadres in various functional departments who made general mistakes, the revolutionary faction helped them clarify their thoughts, put down their burdens, and work boldly. The worker-engineer Liu Kuisheng stood on the wrong side during the movement and made mistakes. Later, with the help of the proletarian revolutionary faction, his thoughts quickly changed. During the machine modification, he spent several weeks squatting by the machine with the workers, studying the modification plan together and conducting experiments together.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Jinan Weaving Factory thus united the majority of the masses and the majority of the cadres, promoted the revolutionization of the thinking of the broad masses of workers, and mobilized all possible enthusiasm. The entire factory's workers took the initiative to successfully modify 180 weaving machines and excellently completed the production task of the new product.

    通过革命大批判  团结两个大多数
    济南织布厂在大批判中，教育和争取受蒙蔽的群众，调动了广大职工的积极性，同心协力抓革命促生产
    本报讯　济南织布厂的无产阶级革命派，在革命的大批判中团结了大多数群众和大多数干部，同心协力抓革命促生产，今年从一月到六月份月月超额完成计划，提前十一天完成了整个上半年的国家任务，七月份生产水平继续提高。
    济南织布厂原来是一个织普通棉布的工厂，今年根据国家的要求改织帆布。这一改变，给生产上带来许多困难：百分之八十以上的设备需要改造；劳动力不足，技术操作不适应。在厂里一小撮走资本主义道路当权派掌权的时候，他们不是积极研究怎样克服困难，来接受这个新的任务，而是想乘机增添机器设备，扩建厂房，扩大人员编制。可是，当他们了解到兄弟厂有的试织了一年多，帆布质量还没有过关的时候，就干脆把任务推掉。
    无产阶级革命派在一月份夺权后，在不增添新设备、不扩建厂房的条件下，毫不犹豫地把织帆布的任务接受下来。
    他们从切身经验中体会到，要把生产搞好，必须首先抓好革命。他们发动了对中国的赫鲁晓夫的大批判运动，同时紧密地联系本厂的问题，揭露和肃清厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派散布的利润挂帅、物质刺激等修正主义流毒。广大群众从而进一步认识到，厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，过去按照中国的赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的意旨，用金钱腐蚀工人阶级，企图把社会主义企业引向资本主义企业的道路上去，用心非常毒辣，后果非常严重。因此，只有肃清他们散布的流毒，用毛泽东思想统帅一切，促进人的思想革命化，才能真正促进生产的发展。
    无产阶级革命派还认识到，只有无产阶级革命派的积极性，没有全厂广大职工的积极性，不但革命搞不好，生产也搞不好。于是，他们遵循毛主席关于从群众中来、到群众中去的教导，把今年的生产任务交给全厂职工讨论，把任务的重要性和存在问题都向群众交底，要求群众发挥积极性和首创精神。结果，广大革命职工抓革命促生产的积极性大为高涨，他们坚决表示：“下班搞革命，上班搞生产，保证优质和高产。”职工们提出许多好主意，想出了许多好办法。工人和技术干部结合起来，昼夜不停地反复试验改装机器。群众自动组织起来学习新的操作技术，成立技术检查小组。
    看到广大职工抓革命促生产的积极性，革命派更加感觉到团结群众大多数和干部大多数的重大意义。他们针对革命派内部的一些思想倾向，进行整风。无产阶级革命派当权后，有的同志不注意执行毛主席关于“政策和策略是党的生命”的教导，对受蒙蔽的群众，不耐心地去做思想政治工作。
    通过开门整风，无产阶级革命派克服了自己队伍里的错误思想倾向，并在职工大会上，对过去革命派的某些过火的行为进行了自我批评。
    从此，无产阶级革命派对受蒙蔽的群众，采取说服教育的方法，团结了绝大多数的群众和自己一道革命，一道生产。
    对于各职能机构中犯有一般错误的干部，革命派帮助他们弄清思想，放下包袱，大胆工作。工人出身的工程师刘奎生在运动中站错了队，犯了错误，后来在无产阶级革命派的帮助下，思想很快有了转变，在改造机器的时候，几周蹲在机器旁边和工人一道研究改造方案，一起动手试验。
    济南织布厂无产阶级革命派就是这样团结了群众的大多数，团结了干部的大多数，促进了广大职工的思想革命化，调动了一切能够调动的积极因素。全厂职工自己动手改制成功一百八十台织布机，出色地完成了新产品的生产任务。
