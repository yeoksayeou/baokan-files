The reactionary film "The Enemy at the Gate" deliberately denigrates the decisive role of the people's army and the masses in the revolutionary war; it maliciously glorifies the reactionary officers of the Kuomintang, elevating them to the position of determining the outcome of the war, thereby fundamentally betraying Chairman Mao's great thought on people's war.

The filmmakers obliterate the revolutionary power of the people's army and the masses, exaggerating the contradictions between the Kuomintang's 203rd Division and the 369th Division, and placing this contradiction above the fundamental contradiction between the people's army and the reactionary army, making it the main contradiction that the entire film seeks to resolve. At the same time, the film attributes the basic driving force for resolving this contradiction to the leaders of the 369th Division, Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanshen, portraying them as the key figures in determining the outcome of this war.

The filmmakers go to great lengths to portray Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanshen as victims of the Kuomintang's reactionary rule, describing them as "stepchildren" who are not treated equally with the elite divisions in terms of benefits, and are constantly suspected, marginalized, and discriminated against politically. Chiang Kai-shek transfers them from the southwest to the northeast and sets up the "General Headquarters Intelligence Department" radio station in the backyard of the 369th Division for "strict surveillance." After Zheng Hanshen is captured and released, Chiang Kai-shek's confidant Qian Xiaozheng immediately suspects him of having "serious suspicions" and issues a secret telegram for investigation. Zheng's wife is also harassed by the patrol squad of the fake 203rd Division. The filmmakers fabricate this "humiliation of the wife," arousing Zheng Hanshen's great hatred, leading him to several times wanting to rally his troops to fight to the death with the elite 203rd Division. Even Zhao Chongwu, who has spent his life serving Chiang Kai-shek, ultimately receives the order to be "eliminated," nearly losing his life. The filmmakers exaggerate the side of the 369th Division being marginalized, placing Zhao and Zheng in a fundamentally opposed position to the elite divisions: the elite divisions are "arrogant and tyrannical," "arrogant and overbearing" oppressors, while Zhao and Zheng are "insulted and injured," the "wise" faction within the Kuomintang's reactionary army.

The film also portrays Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanshen, these criminals, as having "kind" hearts and a "glorious history" as "heroes." They are "concerned about the country and the people," lamenting, "If we continue to fight, the nation's vitality will be lost, and the future of the country will be unthinkable!" The filmmakers replace the reactionary nature of the enemy, and through the so-called "sentiment of sending a son" and "old friend's friendship," forcibly bring the irreconcilable conflicting parties together. The filmmakers also fabricate a "food seizure incident": Zheng Hanshen would rather let his subordinates seize air-dropped supplies from the elite divisions, leading to a tense standoff with guns drawn, than touch a single grain of the people's food. It seems that the leaders of the reactionary杂牌军 are closely related to the people's army and the masses, with common interests, while their contradictions with the Kuomintang's elite divisions are irreconcilable.

The filmmakers, on the one hand, exaggerate the enemy's internal contradictions, and on the other hand, "cleverly" obliterate the fundamental contradiction between the杂牌军 and the people's army and the masses. The purpose is to deny the necessity of armed struggle by the People's Liberation Army and the masses, attempting to make people believe that relying on the struggle of the "wise" faction within the enemy can achieve the "victory" of the War of Liberation. Indeed, after a series of distorted descriptions, Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanshen kill the Kuomintang elite money official Qian Xiaozheng and capture Hu, becoming "heroes" of "opposing the civil war" and "opposing the sale of the country." In this way, our army easily obtained a city.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy, although they cannot unite firmly, although they will have endless quarrels, mutual cursing, mutual blame, and mutual abandonment, but in one aspect, they will cooperate, that is, they will use various methods to try to destroy the revolutionary forces and preserve the reactionary forces." The film "The Enemy at the Gate" dares to openly oppose Chairman Mao's instructions, fundamentally obliterating the class nature of the Kuomintang reactionaries, slandering the people's army and the masses, opposing armed struggle, and attributing the victory of the War of Liberation to the "struggle" of the "wise" faction within the Kuomintang reactionaries. This is the most shameless betrayal of Chairman Mao's thought on people's war! This poisonous weed must be condemned by the whole nation and exterminated by the whole party.

    背叛人民战争思想的大毒草
    南开大学八一八红色造反团文学兵团
    反动影片《兵临城下》，极力贬低人民军队和人民群众在革命战争中的决定作用；别有用心地美化国民党反动军官，并把他们抬高到决定战争胜负的关键位置上，从而根本背叛了毛主席伟大的人民战争思想。
    影片编导者抹煞了人民军队和人民群众的革命力量，大肆渲染国民党嫡系部队二○三师和杂牌军三六九师之间的矛盾，并把这个矛盾凌驾于人民军队和反动军队的根本矛盾之上，成为整个影片所要解决的主要矛盾。同时，影片还把解决这个矛盾的基本动力归之于杂牌军的头目赵崇武和郑汉臣，把他们当作主宰这场战争胜负的关键人物。
    影片编导者费尽心机地把赵崇武、郑汉臣之流打扮成国民党反动统治的受害者，描写他们是“后娘养的”，在待遇上不能同嫡系部队平等，在政治上处处受怀疑，受排挤，受歧视。蒋介石把他们从西南调到东北，把“剿总情报部”的电台架在三六九师的后院，进行“严密监视”。郑汉臣被俘释放后，蒋介石的亲信钱孝正立刻怀疑他有“重大嫌疑”，发出密电，进行追查。郑妻还受到伪二○三师巡逻队的调戏。编导者编造出来的这段“辱妻之恨”，激起了郑汉臣的极大仇恨，几次要拉起队伍同嫡系部队二○三师拚命。而替蒋介石卖命一生的伪师长赵崇武，最后也只落得受“剪除”的密令，差点儿丧生。编导者极力夸大杂牌军受排挤的一面，把赵、郑之流同嫡系部队放在根本对立的地位：嫡系部队是“专横暴虐”、“飞扬跋扈”的压迫者，而赵、郑之流则是“被侮辱被损害”者，是国民党反动军队中的“明智”派。
    影片还把赵崇武、郑汉臣这些罪行累累的反动军官打扮成心地“善良”、有着“光荣历史”的“英雄”。他们“忧国忧民”，感慨什么：“再打下去，民族的元气丧了，国家的前途也不堪设想啊！”编导者偷梁换柱地把敌人的反动本性抽掉，而且通过所谓“送子之情”、“旧友私交”的情节，把不可调和的矛盾双方，硬拉在一起。编导者还捏造了一个“抢粮事件”的情节：郑汉臣宁肯让自己的部下同嫡系部队抢夺空投物资，以至弄到持枪对峙的紧张局面，也不肯触动老百姓的一粮一粟，仿佛反动派杂牌军的头目同人民军队和人民群众是休戚相关，利益一致的，而他们同国民党嫡系部队的矛盾反倒是势不两立的。
    影片编导者一方面拚命夸大敌人内部的矛盾，另一方面又“巧妙地”抹煞杂牌军同人民军队和人民群众的根本矛盾，目的就是否定人民解放军和人民群众进行武装斗争的必要性，企图让人相信，依靠敌人内部“明智”派的斗争，就能夺取解放战争的“胜利”。果然，影片在作了一系列的歪曲描写之后，赵崇武、郑汉臣打死蒋匪嫡系钱孝正，活捉胡高参，成了“反对内战”、“反对卖国”的赫赫“英雄”。就这样，我军垂手得到了一座城市。
    毛主席教导我们：敌人内部“虽然不能够巩固地团结一致，虽然会发生无穷的互相争吵，互相恶骂，互相埋怨，互相抛弃，但是在有一点上却会互相合作，这就是用各种方法力图破坏革命势力而保存反动势力。”影片《兵临城下》竟敢明目张胆地反对毛主席的指示，从根本上抹煞国民党反动派的阶级本性，污蔑人民军队和人民群众，反对武装斗争，而把解放战争的胜利归功于国民党反动派的内部“明智”派的“斗争”。这是对毛主席人民战争思想的最无耻的背叛！对于这棵大毒草，必须全国共讨之，全党共诛之。
