Revolutionary teachers and students of capital schools jointly hold a rally to resume classes and make revolution, and to deepen the great criticism

In the midst of the new high tide of the proletarian revolutionaries in the city deeply criticizing and struggling against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, the revolutionary teachers and students of various middle schools in Beijing held a rally today to resume classes and make revolution, and to deepen the great criticism. More than 20,000 revolutionary youngsters, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary teachers attended the rally, brimming with fighting spirit and enthusiasm. They declared their determination to be promoters of revolutionary great unity, explorers of resuming classes and making revolution, and pioneers of revolutionary great criticism under the guidance of the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

Resuming classes and making revolution is the need of the current revolutionary situation. Revolutionary teachers and students of capital middle schools expressed their firm response to Chairman Mao's great call to immediately return to school to resume classes and make revolution. The revolutionary teachers and students attending the meeting believed that resuming classes and making revolution would greatly promote the great criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the struggle, criticism, and reform of their own units. This is the only correct path to carry the proletarian cultural revolution in middle schools to the end. They pointed out that resuming classes and making revolution first of all requires using Mao Zedong Thought as the commander, uniting to jointly launch the great criticism.

Originally somewhat opposed revolutionary mass organizations sat shoulder to shoulder in the venue today, expressing a common wish: to thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, to thoroughly destroy the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line; to thoroughly smash the old educational system, to thoroughly reform the old educational policies and methods, to fundamentally end the rule of bourgeois intellectuals over our schools, and to firmly grasp the educational power in the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries, and to struggle for the creation of a brand-new proletarian educational system.

Vice Chairman of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee Wu De attended the meeting and extended warm congratulations. He said, today, the revolutionary teachers and students of middle schools in Beijing have united to hold a rally to resume classes and make revolution, and to deepen the great criticism. This meeting is excellent! Through this meeting, the great unity, great criticism, and resuming classes and making revolution of the revolutionary forces in capital middle schools will surely usher in a new high tide. Wu De emphasized that resuming classes and making revolution, at present, is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, to concentrate forces to launch a larger-scale and more extensive and in-depth great criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and against the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique headed by Peng Zhen, to thoroughly criticize and expose this handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, to struggle them down and struggle them to stink. And to closely combine this great criticism and struggle with the struggle, criticism, and reform of their own units. Especially to focus on criticizing the revisionist educational line and educational system, to deeply carry out the educational revolution. We should follow Chairman Mao's "May 7th" directive, to gradually explore and create a new proletarian educational system in line with Mao Zedong Thought. This is a very glorious and great historical task, and is also the basic work of the proletarian cultural revolution. We must work hard in this regard and make new contributions. Wu De also called on the revolutionary mass organizations of middle schools to, through resuming classes and making revolution, to quickly achieve revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, to carry the proletarian cultural revolution in middle schools to the end!

Deputy Commander of the Beijing Garrison Li Zhongqi also spoke at the meeting. He, on behalf of the Beijing Garrison and the participating troops and soldiers of the military and political training of revolutionary teachers and students, extended the warmest congratulations to the meeting. He said, this rally is a great joy for the proletarian cultural revolution in the capital, marking that the proletarian cultural revolution in middle schools has entered a new stage. He said, resuming classes and making revolution will greatly promote and consolidate the revolutionary great unity and revolutionary three-in-one combination. We, the proletarian revolutionaries of middle schools, Chairman Mao's Little Red Guards, should act quickly, hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively, launch a new high tide of revolutionary great criticism, launch a new high tide of resuming classes and making revolution. We, the troops and soldiers participating in military and political training, firmly respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao, unite with the proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary teachers and students of middle schools, fight together, and win together, to contribute all our strength to truly make the middle schools in the capital a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Representatives of Shijingshan Middle School, 23rd Middle School, 91st Middle School, Bai Jia Zhuang Middle School, Cao Chang Di Middle School, and 89th Middle School, who have taken the lead in revolutionary great criticism, great unity, and resuming classes and making revolution, jointly spoke, saying that since these schools resumed classes and made revolution, they have launched a new high tide of extensively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, launched a great criticism against the bourgeois reactionary line and the revisionist educational system, the direction of struggle has become clearer, the fighting spirit has become more ardent, and the revolutionary great unity has become more consolidated. The deeper the revolutionary great criticism goes, the deeper the revolutionary teachers and students understand the reactionary nature of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and the deeper their hatred for them. At present, the surging proletarian revolutionary army is vigorously criticizing the old educational system that poisons the cause of the proletarian revolution and the successors, which was promoted by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party.

The 6th Middle School, Women's First Middle School, 35th Middle School, Women's Third Middle School, Fengsheng School, Beijing Normal University Affiliated Girls' School, 5th Middle School, and Women's 12th Middle School, which are actively promoting revolutionary great unity, also made a joint speech at the meeting, expressing their determination to learn from the schools that have already united and to catch up quickly.

Representatives of the Beijing Aviation Industry School, the Beijing Half-Work Half-Study Red Flag Automobile Driving School, and the revolutionary teachers of the Beijing Geological Academy Affiliated Middle School also spoke at the meeting.

Attending today's meeting were also Vice Chairman of the Beijing Revolutionary Committee Fu Chongbi, and Committee Members Li Dongmin, Zhou Jingfang, Ding Guoyi, and Huang Zuozhen.

    首都中等学校革命师生联合召开复课闹革命深入开展大批判誓师大会
    在毛泽东思想指导下做革命大批判闯将
    彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资派和彭真反革命修正主义集团，彻底摧毁修正主义教育路线，彻底砸烂旧教育制度，从根本上结束资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，逐步探索和创建新的符合毛泽东思想的无产阶级教育制度
    新华社十七日讯　在全市无产阶级革命派深入开展对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和彭真反革命修正主义集团的大批判、大斗争的新高潮中，北京市各中等学校的广大革命派师生，今天联合召开了首都中等学校复课闹革命、深入开展革命大批判誓师大会。参加大会的两万多名革命小将和革命干部、革命教师，斗志昂扬、豪情满怀。他们表示，决心在毛泽东思想伟大红旗指导下，做革命大联合的促进派，做复课闹革命的探索者，做革命大批判的闯将。
    复课闹革命，这是当前革命形势发展的需要。首都中学的广大革命师生表示坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，立即回校复课闹革命。到会革命师生认为复课闹革命必将大大推动中等学校对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判和本单位的斗批改。这是把中学无产阶级文化大革命进行到底唯一正确的道路。他们指出，复课闹革命，首先就要以毛泽东思想为统帅，联合起来共同展开大批判。
    原来比较对立的各革命群众组织，今天在会场上肩并肩地坐在一起，表示了共同的心愿：彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和彭真反革命修正主义集团，彻底摧毁反革命修正主义教育路线；彻底砸烂旧的教育制度，彻底改革旧的教育方针和教育方法，从根本上结束资产阶级知识分子对我们学校的统治，把教育大权牢牢掌握在无产阶级革命派手里，为创建一个崭新的无产阶级教育制度而斗争。
    北京市革命委员会副主任委员吴德到会热烈祝贺。他说，今天，北京市中学的广大革命师生联合起来，召开复课闹革命、深入开展大批判的誓师大会。这个大会好得很！通过这个大会，首都中学革命派的大联合、大批判和复课闹革命，必将掀起一个新的高潮。吴德强调指出，复课闹革命，在当前，就是要高举毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，集中力量向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，向以彭真为首的旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团展开更大规模、更加广泛深入的大批判、大斗争，把这一小撮反革命修正主义分子彻底批深、批臭，斗倒、斗臭。并且把这种大批判、大斗争同本单位的斗批改密切结合起来。特别要着重批判修正主义的教育路线和教育制度，深入进行教育革命。我们要遵照毛主席的“五·七”指示，逐步探索和创建新的符合毛泽东思想的无产阶级教育制度。这是一个极其光荣而伟大的历史任务，也是无产阶级文化大革命的基本功。我们必须在这方面下苦功夫，作出新的贡献。吴德还号召中学的革命群众组织，通过复课闹革命，要在毛泽东思想的基础上尽快实现革命的大联合和革命的三结合，把中学的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    中国人民解放军北京卫戍区副司令员李钟奇也在会上讲了话。他代表北京卫戍区和参加革命师生军政训练的部队指战员，向大会致以最热烈的祝贺。他说，这个誓师大会，是首都无产阶级文化大革命的一件大喜事，标志着中学的无产阶级文化大革命进入了一个新的阶段。他说，复课闹革命必将大大地促进和巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。我们中学的无产阶级革命派，毛主席的红小兵，应当迅速行动起来，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，掀起革命大批判的新高潮，掀起复课闹革命的新高潮。我们参加军政训练的部队指战员，坚决响应伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召，同中学的无产阶级革命派和广大革命师生，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，为把首都中学真正办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校贡献我们的一切力量。
    在革命的大批判、大联合、复课闹革命中走在前头的石景山中学、二十三中、九十一中、白家庄中学、草场地中学、八十九中的代表联合发言说，这些学校复课闹革命以来，掀起了大学大用毛主席著作的新高潮，掀起了对资产阶级反动路线和修正主义教育制度的大批判，斗争方向更加明确，斗志更加昂扬，革命的大联合更加巩固。革命的大批判每进一步，革命的师生对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派反动本质的认识便深入一步，对他们的仇恨便加深一层。目前浩浩荡荡的无产阶级革命大军，正在大力批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所推行的毒害无产阶级革命事业接班人的旧的教育制度。
    正在积极推进革命大联合的六中、女一中、三十五中、女三中、丰盛学校、师大女附中、五中、女十二中，也在会上作了联合发言，表示要向已经联合起来的学校学习，紧紧追上。
    北京市航空工业学校、半工半读红旗汽车驾驶学校的联合代表和北京地质学院附中革命教师代表，都在大会上发了言。
    参加今天大会的还有北京市革命委员会副主任委员傅崇碧，常委李冬民、周景方、丁国钰、黄作珍。
