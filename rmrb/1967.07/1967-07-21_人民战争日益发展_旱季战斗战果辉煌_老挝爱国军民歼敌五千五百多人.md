	The statement pointed out that the glorious victories of this dry season prove the firm resolve of the patriotic forces of Laos and the Lao people to fight bravely and strive for victory, prove that the Lao People's Liberation Army and the patriotic neutral armed forces are rapidly growing and closely coordinating their actions, prove the close unity between the Lao military and civilians, prove that the guerrilla war in Laos has developed on a national scale, and that the people's war has further unfolded.

	The statement called on the patriotic military and civilian people of Laos to further strengthen their unity, annihilate more enemies, and thoroughly smash all the plots of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to sabotage the liberated areas.

	According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station, the patriotic military and civilian people of central and southern Laos have bravely fought and smashed multiple attacks and "sweeps" by U.S. invaders and the Vientiane puppet regime's army in the first five months of this year, eliminating a large number of enemy troops.
