Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Three Articles" have been published in Lahore.

Pakistani youth, after studying "Three Articles," say: To defeat imperialism, one must have the spirit of moving mountains like Yu Gong; all the people of the world must unite and support each other in the struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

New China News Agency, Rawalpindi: The Urdu translation of Chairman Mao's brilliant works "Three Articles" has recently been published in the form of a pamphlet in the western Pakistani capital of Lahore, and has been warmly received by the Pakistani people.

Earlier, these three articles by Chairman Mao had been published consecutively in the Urdu weekly magazine "Rock" in western Pakistan's Lahore. Meanwhile, a publisher in Karachi has also translated "Three Articles" into Urdu and published them as three separate pamphlets.

Pakistani youth and students have a deep love for "Three Articles." Some of them can already recite passages from memory. Many young people, after studying these brilliant works, have voluntarily formed small groups to discuss the important significance of these works and to understand Chairman Mao's teachings.

A student from Dhaka said: " 'In Memory of Norman Bethune' is a guide for my life's purpose. I will live for the people's interests and die for the people's interests."

A student from Lahore said, after studying Chairman Mao's "In Memory of Norman Bethune," that he understood, "In the common struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionary forces, the people of the world must unite and support each other." Another student from Lahore said: "To defeat imperialism, we must have the courage and perseverance of moving mountains like Yu Gong. Only by persisting in the anti-imperialist struggle can we achieve final and complete victory."

    毛主席光辉著作“老三篇”在拉合尔出版
    巴基斯坦青年在学习“老三篇”后说：为了打败帝国主义，必须具有愚公移山的精神；全世界人民在反对帝修反的斗争中，必须团结起来，相互支持
    新华社拉瓦尔品第电　毛主席的光辉著作“老三篇”的乌尔都文译本，最近以小册子的形式在西巴基斯坦首府拉合尔出版，受到了巴基斯坦人民的无比热爱。
    早些时候，毛主席的这三篇著作已经在西巴基斯坦莱雅普尔的乌尔都文周刊《顽石》上连续发表过。同时，卡拉奇的一位出版者也已把“老三篇”译为乌尔都文，分别以三本小册子出版。
    巴基斯坦青年学生非常热爱“老三篇”。他们中有些人已经能够背诵一些段落。很多青年人在学习了这三篇光辉著作后，自动组成小组，讨论这些著作的重要意义和领会毛主席的教导。
    达卡的一位学生说：“《为人民服务》是对我一生的目的的指导。我将为人民的利益而生，为人民的利益而死。”
    拉合尔的一位学生说，学习了毛主席的《纪念白求恩》一文后，使我懂得，“全世界人民在反对帝国主义、修正主义和反动势力的共同斗争中，必须团结起来，相互支持。”拉合尔的另一位学生说：“为了打败帝国主义，我们必须具有愚公移山那样的勇气和毅力。只有坚持反帝斗争，我们才能赢得最后的和完全的胜利。”
