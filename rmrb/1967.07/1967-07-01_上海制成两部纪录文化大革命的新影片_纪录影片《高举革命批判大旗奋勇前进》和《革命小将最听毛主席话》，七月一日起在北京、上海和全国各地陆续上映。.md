Shanghai has produced two new documentaries about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The documentaries "Hold High the Banner of Revolutionary Criticism and March Forward Bravely" and "The Revolutionary Youngsters Listen Most to Chairman Mao" will begin screening in Beijing, Shanghai, and across the country starting July 1st.

New China News Agency, June 30th: The documentaries "Hold High the Banner of Revolutionary Criticism and March Forward Bravely" and "The Revolutionary Youngsters Listen Most to Chairman Mao" will begin screening in Beijing, Shanghai, and across the country starting July 1st.

"Hold High the Banner of Revolutionary Criticism and March Forward Bravely" records the scenes of the revolutionary struggle in Shanghai, where the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, bravely criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The great unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" have shown tremendous power. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, revolutionary teachers and students, and revolutionary cadres stand on the front line of the struggle, singing revolutionary songs of victory and reporting frequent production successes. The entire film, with its true and moving footage, forms a microcosm of the current great situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country.

The documentary "The Revolutionary Youngsters Listen Most to Chairman Mao," which records the "resume classes and make revolution" movement in Shanghai's primary and secondary schools, widely showcases the revolutionary scene of Shanghai's revolutionary teachers and students firmly executing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They enthusiastically respond to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, return from society to schools, and carry out revolutionary great unity based on teaching classes. They seriously study Chairman Mao's works and actively participate in military and political training. Scene after scene of moving scenes show that the revolutionary teachers and students who have been tempered in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have further strengthened their revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline. They are not only the pioneers of stopping classes to make revolution but also the models of resuming classes to make revolution. These two films were produced by the Shanghai Workers, Peasants, and Soldiers Film Studio and the Shanghai Dongfanghong Film Studio, respectively.
