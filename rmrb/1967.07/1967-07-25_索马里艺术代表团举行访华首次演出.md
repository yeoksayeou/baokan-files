The Somalian art troupe held its first performance in China at the Capital Theater tonight, receiving a warm welcome from the audience in the capital.

The Somalian artists, bringing the deep friendship of the Somalian people to the Chinese people, enthusiastically sang praises to the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, on the Chinese stage. The performers waved red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in front of a portrait of Chairman Mao, singing "The East Is Red" and "The Ship Sails on Because of the Helmsman" over and over again. They also sang a special Somalian song composed for this visit to China, "Praising Chairman Mao," which goes: "Chairman Mao Zedong, you are like the sun, you are like the moon. You guide the Chinese people onto the correct path, nurture them, and make China stand tall among the nations of the world. You are the pride of the Asian and African peoples, and everyone knows your greatness."

The Somalian artists also performed a short play, "Sino-Somali Friendship," enthusiastically praising the friendship between the two peoples. At the end of the performance, the actors shouted in Chinese, "Long live the friendship between the peoples of China and Somalia! Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

The Somalian artists also performed folk songs and dances reflecting the Somalian people's struggle against colonial rule and their fight for national independence.

Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo and relevant officials watched the performance. During the intermission, Vice Chairman Guo Moruo met with the head of the Somalian art troupe, Jama Harraf, deputy head Yusuf Ali Halen, and some members of the troupe, engaging in friendly and cordial conversation.
