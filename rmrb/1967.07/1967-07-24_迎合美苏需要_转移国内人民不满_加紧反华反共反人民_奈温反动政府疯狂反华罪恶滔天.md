To meet the needs of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, and to divert the domestic people's dissatisfaction with its reactionary rule, the Ne Win reactionary government in Burma has recently launched a frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese wave across the entire country, committing a series of unprecedented fascist atrocities, pushing its years-long persecution of Chinese nationals to a new height.

Since the Ne Win reactionary government came to power, it has gradually intensified its anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. It first struck at Chinese nationals economically, cutting off their livelihoods and attempting to drive them to their deaths. On the other hand, it ruthlessly destroyed the cultural and educational undertakings of Chinese nationals, depriving them of the right to receive education in their mother tongue. Under the pretext of "nationalization," it plundered Chinese nationals in a bandit-like manner. In March and April 1964, the Ne Win reactionary clique issued a "nationalization" order, seizing all shops run by Chinese nationals and their descendants in Rangoon and other cities. Immediately afterward, on May 1, it dismissed all foreign employees in the "nationalized" shops. This drove many Chinese nationals to bankruptcy and left a large number of them jobless. In the name of "nationalization of education," the Ne Win reactionary government took over a total of 136 patriotic Chinese schools in 1965 and April 1966. In addition, the Ne Win reactionary clique ordered the suspension of publication of four patriotic Chinese newspapers in January 1966, thus completely strangling the cultural and educational undertakings of Chinese nationals.

At the same time, newspapers that are pro-Ne Win reactionary government and pro-U.S. imperialism have been rampantly slandering Chinese nationals.

Over the past few years, due to the Ne Win reactionary clique's policy of ruthless plunder of the domestic people, Burma has fallen into a serious economic crisis, and class struggle within the country has become unprecedentedly acute. To maintain its reactionary rule, the Ne Win clique, while further currying favor with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, has intensified its anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. In particular, the profound influence of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on the Burmese people and Chinese nationals, and the widespread dissemination of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in Burma, have made the Ne Win reactionary clique even more terrified. Therefore, it has been trying every means to incite nationalist sentiments to divert the people's attention. At the second annual congress of the Burma "Socialist Programme Party" held in November last year, Ne Win himself sounded the bugle for a full-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese campaign, grossly slandering and attacking the great People's Republic of China. Since then, Ne Win's mouthpiece newspapers, the *New Light of Burma* and the *Guardian*, have been continuously publishing editorials and articles slandering and attacking Chinese nationals to create public opinion for large-scale persecution of Chinese nationals.

In the first half of this year, local authorities in Burma openly dispatched large numbers of military police to expel several hundred Chinese nationals residing in the Burmese side of the China-Burma border area. They also arbitrarily arrested more than a thousand Chinese nationals holding legal identity cards. In the process of expelling Chinese nationals, Burmese reactionary military police and government officials took advantage of the situation to loot, rape, and abduct, committing all kinds of atrocities. It is reported that at least three Chinese nationals were beaten to death, and the arrested Chinese nationals have not been released to this day.

The Ne Win reactionary clique is extremely hostile to the broad masses of Chinese nationals who love Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought and actively study Chairman Mao's works. In many places, the Burmese reactionary authorities often send spies to monitor and sabotage Chinese nationals studying Chairman Mao's works, and confiscate Chinese nationals' copies of the *Quotations from Chairman Mao* and *Selected Works of Mao Zedong*.

In June, the reactionary authorities in Momeik brazenly announced a ban on Chinese students wearing Chairman Mao badges. After encountering the resolute opposition and strong protests of Chinese students and their parents, the Burmese reactionary authorities actually dispatched large numbers of military police to forcibly remove Chairman Mao badges from Chinese students. However, the Chinese students who have boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao fearlessly engaged in reasoned struggle against the fascist soldiers' threats and intimidation. The Burmese reactionary authorities, enraged and humiliated, arbitrarily expelled 66 Chinese students.

After that, the Ne Win reactionary government issued an order stipulating that students in all schools in Burma could only wear badges prescribed by the Burmese government and were not allowed to wear any other badges. This is the beginning of the Ne Win reactionary government's deliberate creation of a pretext to carry out large-scale persecution of Chinese nationals.

On June 26, 27, and 28, the Burmese reactionary government instigated and connived at large mobs in Rangoon to launch large-scale frenzied attacks on Chinese schools, looting Chinese property, and massacring Chinese nationals. They continuously directed mobs to attack the Chinese Embassy and other Chinese representative agencies, and killed Chinese expert Liu Yi inside the Chinese Embassy.

Especially since early July, the Ne Win reactionary government, disregarding the serious warnings of the Chinese government and the Chinese people, has pushed its premeditated anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities nationwide, from medium and small towns to the countryside, and even to the border areas of ethnic minorities, ruthlessly plundering and persecuting Chinese nationals, holding large-scale anti-China "demonstrations" and rallies, and creating anti-China public opinion to thoroughly sabotage the relations between the two countries.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "No matter how rampant the reactionaries at home and abroad are (this rampancy is a historical inevitability and nothing to be surprised at), we are able to defeat them." The Ne Win reactionary clique's frenzied persecution of Chinese nationals, who have made positive contributions to Sino-Burmese friendship, is contrary to the interests and wishes of the Burmese people. The friendship between the peoples of China and Burma is indestructible. The Ne Win clique's retrogressive and counterproductive actions will only provoke more intense and widespread resistance from the Burmese people against its reactionary rule, accelerating its own downfall.

    迎合美苏需要　转移国内人民不满　加紧反华反共反人民
    奈温反动政府疯狂反华罪恶滔天
    新华社二十三日讯  本社记者报道：缅甸奈温反动政府迎合美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的需要，并且为了转移国内人民对其反动统治的不满，最近掀起了遍及全缅甸的疯狂反华排华浪潮，制造了一系列的罕见的法西斯暴行，把它几年来对华侨的残酷迫害推向新的高峰。
    奈温反动政府上台后，逐步加紧了反华排华活动。它首先从经济上打击华侨，断绝华侨的生计，妄图置华侨于死地。另一方面，它又疯狂地摧残华侨的文化教育事业，剥夺他们接受祖国文化教育的权利。它在“国有化”的幌子下，对华侨进行了强盗式的掠夺。一九六四年三、四月间，奈温反动集团用一纸“国有化”命令，就把在仰光和其它城市的华侨华裔经营的商店据为己有。紧接着在五月一日，又解雇了收归“国有”的商店中的全部外侨雇员。这就使得许多华侨倾家荡产，大批华侨丧失生计。奈温反动政府又在“教育国有化”的名义下，于一九六五年和一九六六年四月间，先后共接管了一百三十六所爱国华侨办的学校。此外，奈温反动集团还在一九六六年一月勒令四家爱国华侨报纸停刊，从而完全扼杀了华侨文化教育事业。
    与此同时，亲奈温反动政府的和亲美帝的反动报纸猖狂污蔑华侨。
    几年以来，由于奈温反动集团对国内人民实行残酷的掠夺的政策，使缅甸陷入严重的经济危机，国内阶级斗争空前尖锐。为了保持它的反动统治，奈温集团在进一步投靠美帝、苏修的同时，加紧反共、反人民和反华、排华。特别是去年以来中国无产阶级文化大革命在缅甸人民和华侨中间产生的深远影响，和战无不胜的毛泽东思想在缅甸广泛传播，使奈温反动集团对此更加恐惧，因此，它千方百计煽动民族主义情绪，企图转移人民视线。奈温本人在去年十一月举行的缅甸“社会主义纲领党”第二次年会上，就吹响了全面反华、排华的号角，大肆污蔑和攻击伟大的中华人民共和国。此后，奈温的御用报纸《劳动人民日报》、《卫报》等不断发表社论文章污蔑、攻击华侨，为大规模迫害华侨制造舆论。
    今年上半年，缅甸地方当局公然出动大批军警，把居住在中缅边境地区缅方境内的数百名华侨无理驱逐出境。并且无理地逮捕了一千多名持有合法身份证的华侨。在驱逐华侨的过程中，缅甸反动军警和政府官员趁火打劫，奸淫掳掠，无恶不作。据悉，至少有三名华侨被打死，被捕的华侨至今尚未被释放。
    奈温反动集团对于广大华侨热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想，积极学习毛主席著作极端仇视。在许多地区，缅甸反动当局经常派出特务监视、破坏华侨学习毛主席著作，没收华侨的《毛主席语录》和《毛泽东选集》。
    八莫地方反动当局在六月间悍然宣布禁止华侨学生佩戴毛主席像章，在遭到华侨学生和家长的坚决反对和强烈抗议以后，缅甸反动当局竟出动大批军警，用武力强迫华侨学生摘下毛主席像章。但是，无限热爱伟大领袖毛主席的华侨学生，不顾法西斯军人的恐吓、威胁，向他们展开了说理斗争。缅甸反动当局恼羞成怒，竟无理开除了六十六名华侨学生。
    在此以后，奈温反动政府颁布了一道命令，规定全缅甸各学校学生除了佩戴缅甸政府规定的徽章外，不准佩戴其它徽章。这是奈温反动政府蓄意制造借口，对华侨进行大规模迫害的开端。
    六月二十六日、二十七日、二十八日缅甸反动政府唆使和纵容大批暴徒在仰光市内大规模地疯狂袭击华侨学校，抢劫华侨财物，屠杀华侨，连续指挥暴徒袭击中国大使馆和中国其它代表机构，并在中国大使馆内杀害了中国援缅专家刘逸。
    特别是七月初以来，奈温反动政府不顾中国政府和中国人民的严重警告，把它一手策划的反华排华暴行推向全国，由中、小城镇到农村，以至于边境少数民族地区，大肆掠夺迫害华侨，大搞反华“示威”和集会，同时大肆制造反华舆论，以便彻底破坏缅中两国关系。
    毛主席教导我们：“不管中外反动派如何猖獗（这种猖獗是历史必然性，毫不足奇），我们是能够战胜他们的。”奈温反动集团对曾经为中缅人民友好做出积极贡献的华侨进行的疯狂的迫害，是违背缅甸人民的利益和愿望的。中缅两国人民之间的友谊是破坏不了的，奈温集团这种倒行逆施的做法只能激起缅甸人民对其反动统治的更激烈，更广泛的反抗，加速它自己的灭亡。
