Title: Stop the Phenomenon of Purely Pursuing Form and Wasting Resources

Edition: 3

Editors' Note: The situations reported by readers from Henan and Beijing are worth noting.

Not emphasizing practical results and pursuing forms one-sidedly; extravagantly spending state funds on long-distance tours and sightseeing, and other wasteful phenomena, are completely incompatible with the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution currently being widely and deeply carried out.

Every proletarian revolutionary must resolutely oppose these phenomena and thoroughly eliminate all wasteful practices that harm state interests.

"To save is to make revolution," this is the great call made by Chairman Mao. We must not just respond to this call in words, but must implement it in actual deeds, making thrift a widespread practice throughout the country. Editors:

In our Biehe District, some production teams, in order to show outstanding political performance, have exhibited the phenomenon of purely pursuing forms and wasting resources. For example, to make "red flags like a sea," each household is required to make a three-foot by three-foot red flag to hang on the door, and each production team collectively must make several. To achieve "signboardization," regardless of how many doors a household has, each door's sides must be plastered with rectangular signboards made of lime, painted red, and inscribed with yellow characters. To achieve "framing" and "pouchization," each community member going to work in the fields must carry a Chairman Mao portrait frame and a red quotation pouch. Those who do not carry these items are labeled as "backward." To achieve these "izations," each production team has to spend 200 to 300 yuan and 200 to 300 feet of cloth coupons. Where does the money come from? Some teams collect it from community members, and most use the summer distribution funds. Those without cloth coupons are also required to provide them. Currently, red cloth, paint, and lime are all in short supply. This trend is spreading quickly; when one region sees another doing it, they immediately follow suit, unwilling to be "left behind."

Editors:

Recently, our prefecture and county have arranged for each production team to make three to five large flags, and each laborer to make one small flag. Regardless of the size of the village, overpass quotation boards (red paint and yellow characters written on white iron boards, hung in the middle of the road) must be made. Many cadres think this does not conform to the spirit of saving to make revolution, but immediately someone puts a big hat on them. Thus, borrowing money is also necessary to make the red flags and quotation boards. Many production teams have to take out loans to make red flags and quotation boards.

### 制止单纯追求形式的浪费现象

    制止单纯追求形式的浪费现象
    编者按：河南、北京等地读者反映的情况，很值得大家注意。
    不讲实效、片面追求形式；慷国家之慨、长途旅行游览等等浪费现象，同当前正在广泛深入开展的伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动，是完全格格不入的。
    每一个无产阶级革命派，都应当坚决造它的反，把一切损害国家利益的浪费现象彻底反掉。
    “要节约闹革命”，这是毛主席向我们发出的伟大号召。我们决不能只是在口头上响应这个号召，一定要在实际行动上落实这个号召，让节约蔚然成风，风行全国。编辑同志：
    在我们拐河区，有些生产队为了表现突出政治，出现了单纯追求形式的浪费现象。例如，为了“红旗象大海洋”，叫每户社员做一面三尺长三尺宽的大红旗插在门上，每个生产队集体还得做几面。为了“语录牌化”，不管一家有几个门，每个门的两边都要用石灰搪成长方形的语录牌，涂上红漆，写上黄字。为了“相框化”、“语录袋化”，每个社员上地劳动都要带上毛主席相框和红色语录袋，谁不带就成了“落后”。要实现这几“化”，每个生产队都得开支二三百元钱和二三百尺布票。钱从哪里来？有的队是发动社员拿，大部分是用了夏季分配款，没有布票也叫社员拿。目前，当地红布、油漆、石灰等都脱销。这股风也传得很快，这个地区看见那个地区搞，也马上行动，不甘“落后”。

    最近，我们专区和县里都布置：每个生产队要做三至五面大旗，每个劳力做一面小旗，不管大小村庄，都要做过街语录牌（在白铁板上涂红漆写黄字，挂在路上空）。有很多干部认为这不符合节约闹革命的精神，可是马上就有人给扣大帽子。于是，借钱也得做，不少生产队只得贷款做红旗和语录牌。　河南尉氏县蔡庄　一读者
