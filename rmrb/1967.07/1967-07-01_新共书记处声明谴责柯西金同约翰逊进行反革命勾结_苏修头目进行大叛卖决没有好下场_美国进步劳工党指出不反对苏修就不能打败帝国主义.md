The New Zealand Communist Party National Secretariat issued a statement on the 26th, severely condemning the Soviet revisionist leader Khrushchev for holding talks with the American imperialist head Johnson, betraying the revolutionary interests of the people of the world. The statement pointed out that such secret talks "will not solve any global problems except to sacrifice the interests of ordinary people around the world."

The statement wrote, "Khrushchev only verbally condemns the aggression of the United States, but in action, he pursues U.S.-Soviet cooperation. The price Johnson wants for this—and which Khrushchev is willing to pay—is: the surrender of the Vietnamese people; the suppression of the Arab liberation movement." The statement condemned, "Khrushchev is playing a disgusting two-faced game. Just as he promises full support to the Vietnamese and Arab peoples, he is betraying them. Otherwise, he would refuse to meet Johnson while the United States continues to invade Vietnam. He would not be able to smile and pose for a photo with someone who orders the dropping of napalm, poison gas, and chemical bombs on the Vietnamese people."

The statement emphasized, "The entire policy and practice of the Soviet revisionist leaders are marked by this two-facedness. This is why ordinary people cannot believe their words—these words are constantly negated by their actions."

The statement continued, "But this two-facedness will not have a good outcome. The result of the (Khrushchev and Johnson) Hollybush talks can only make more people realize that when the Soviet revisionists and American imperialists collude, the result will inevitably be the betrayal of socialism and national liberation."

The New China News Agency, London, reported that the American Progressive Labor Party issued a statement on the 19th, strongly condemning the Soviet revisionist leader Khrushchev for rushing to the United Nations, controlled by the United States, to plot a global conspiracy with American imperialism. The statement pointed out that the Soviet revisionists are the greatest traitors to the people of the world, and that anti-imperialism must mean anti-revisionism.

The statement said, "Khrushchev's hasty trip to the United Nations under U.S. control highlights the failure of Soviet policy." The statement pointed out that the Soviet revisionists' shameful surrender in the Middle East "further exposed the collusion between the United States and the Soviet Union." "The people of the world have seen the results of Soviet ('aid') support: the closer you cooperate with them, the greater the chance you will be betrayed by them."

The statement emphasized, "The main aspect of Soviet policy is to use the maintenance of 'peace' as a pretext to betray the revolution and support American imperialism."

The statement continued, "The logical result of this policy of the Soviet revisionists is to strengthen the position of the U.S. government, encouraging the U.S. to gradually escalate its genocidal wars of aggression, as in Vietnam. The Soviet revisionists are the greatest traitors to the people of the world. No matter how much big talk there is in the United Nations under U.S. control, it cannot cover up the reactionary nature of the Soviet government."

The statement finally pointed out, "If the people do not oppose the Soviet revisionists, they will not be able to defeat imperialism. The oppressed peoples of the world must rise up to oppose the Soviet revisionists to defeat imperialism."

　　新共书记处声明谴责柯西金同约翰逊进行反革命勾结
　　苏修头目进行大叛卖决没有好下场
　　美国进步劳工党指出不反对苏修就不能打败帝国主义
    新华社惠灵顿电　新西兰共产党全国书记处二十六日发表一项声明，严厉谴责苏修头目柯西金同美帝头子约翰逊举行会谈，出卖世界人民的革命利益，指出这种密谈，“除了牺牲全世界普通人民的利益之外，决不会解决任何世界性的问题”。
    声明写道，柯西金只是在口头上谴责一下美国的侵略，“但在行动上，他追求的是美苏合作。约翰逊为此所要的代价——同时也是柯西金愿付的代价——就是：越南人民屈膝投降；镇压阿拉伯解放运动”。声明谴责说：“柯西金正在玩弄丑恶的两面手法。就在他答应全力支持越南人民和阿拉伯人民的同时，却在干着出卖他们的勾当。否则的话，在美国继续侵略越南的情况下，他就会拒绝会见约翰逊。他就不可能笑容满面地同一个下令对越南人民投掷凝固汽油弹、毒气弹和化学弹的人一起照相。”
    声明强调说：“苏联修正主义者头头们的全部政策和实践都打上了这种两面派的烙印。这就是为什么普通人民决不能相信他们的言论——这些言论不断被他们的行动所否定”。
    声明接着说：“但是，这种两面派是决不会有好下场的。（柯西金和约翰逊在）霍利布什会谈的结果只能向更多的人表明，当苏修和美帝搞在一起的时候，其结果必然是出卖社会主义和民族解放。”
    新华社伦敦电　美国进步劳工党十九日发表一项声明，强烈谴责苏修头目柯西金跑到美国去同美帝国主义策划全球性大勾结。声明指出，苏修是世界人民最大的叛徒，反帝必须反修。
    声明说：“柯西金匆匆赶到美国操纵下的联合国去这件事，着重地说明了苏联政策的破产。”声明指出，苏联修正主义者在中东地区可耻的投降，“进一步暴露了美国和苏联狼狈为奸”。“全世界人民看到了苏联（“援助”）支持的后果：你同他们配合得愈是密切，你被他们出卖的可能性就愈大。”
    声明着重指出：“苏联政策的主要方面，就是以维护‘和平’为名，出卖革命，支持美帝国主义。”
    声明接着说，苏联修正主义者“这种政策的逻辑结果是，加强美国政府的地位，鼓励美国把灭绝种族的侵略战争逐步升级，就象在越南那样。苏修是世界人民最大的叛徒。不管在美国操纵下的联合国讲多少大话，都掩盖不了苏联政府的反动性质。”
    声明最后指出，如果不反对苏联修正主义者，人民就不可能打败帝国主义，世界被压迫人民要打败帝国主义，就必须起来反对苏联修正主义者。
