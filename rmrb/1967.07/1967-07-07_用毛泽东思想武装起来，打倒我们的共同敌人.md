All revolutionary struggles in the world aim to seize power and consolidate it. Under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, class struggle is also waged to consolidate power.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the key question for revolution. The fundamental reason why all previous revolutionary struggles in China achieved so little is that we were unable to unite our true friends to attack our true enemies."

For decades, under the guidance of the revolutionary line formulated by Chairman Mao's class analysis, the Chinese revolution has achieved one victory after another. In China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and achieved great victories.

The works of Chairman Mao are the most powerful weapons against imperialism and modern revisionism. The power of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought lies in their combination with the concrete revolutionary practices of various countries. If one divorces Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought from the specific characteristics of various countries and engages in empty talk, or even distorts their basic principles, one cannot correctly understand and apply Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao said: "There are two attitudes towards learning. One is the dogmatic attitude, which does not consider the situation in our country, and indiscriminately applies what is applicable and what is not. This attitude is not good. The other attitude is to think with one's brain when learning, to learn what is suitable for our country's situation, that is, to absorb beneficial experiences, and this is the attitude we need."

We study Mao Zedong Thought for practical application. We study Mao Zedong Thought to solve practical problems of the revolution. We should study with questions in mind, learn actively and apply actively, combine learning with use, learn what is urgently needed first, and see immediate results.

To correctly solve the revolutionary problems of one's own country, one must first clarify the social nature, revolutionary tasks, principal contradictions, revolutionary allies, and revolutionary leadership of one's own country. One must use the Marxist-Leninist standpoint, viewpoint, and method to concretely analyze these problems.

Chairman Mao said: "If one wants a revolution, one must have a revolutionary party. Without a revolutionary party, without a party built according to Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory and revolutionary style, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs."

The core force leading the Burmese revolution is the Burmese Communist Party, armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. This party, with its correct program, has led the Burmese people in nearly twenty years of armed struggle and achieved great victories.

As a revolutionary party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, together with the Communist Party of China, we resolutely wage an unyielding struggle against modern revisionism centered on the leadership of the CPSU.

Who is the revolutionary leadership? Who to rely on? What enemies to defeat? Clearly recognizing and solving this primary question of the revolution is a fundamental issue of whether one can achieve revolutionary victory and consolidate the power gained.

The people's democratic revolution and socialist revolution in China provide us with a vivid example.

"Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" is an important and correct guideline for seizing power and establishing people's democratic power. Contemporary world national democratic revolutions, if they forget this point, will definitely hit a wall. Imperialism and its running dogs are slaughtering people everywhere. Those who pin their hopes on their "goodwill" and "wisdom" will only degenerate into accomplices of imperialism—modern revisionism.

Today, the main task of national democratic revolutions in various countries is to oppose imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism and its running dogs. The reactionaries in various countries are agents of imperialism and feudalism. The agents in Burma are the Ne Win military government. Although they wear masks, they are enemies of the people. Imperialism and modern revisionism treat them as good friends and provide various forms of aid. Modern revisionism centered on the leadership of the CPSU has long been an obstacle on the road of national democratic revolutionary struggle. These obstacles must be removed and a resolute struggle must be waged against them.

Under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party, the revolutionary forces of the Burmese people are growing stronger day by day. Workers, peasants, petty bourgeoisie, intellectuals, patriotic capitalists, ethnic minorities, oppressed overseas Chinese and Indian residents, and democratic personages are closely uniting. To defeat the main enemy and to establish people's democratic dictatorship, these people must unite like steel under the leadership of a party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. The revolutionary people of Burma, while opposing the Ne Win military government, have never relaxed their opposition to the U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism behind it.

As the Burmese national democratic revolutionary movement surges, the political and economic crises of the Ne Win military government deepen further. In search of a way out, it will inevitably resort to desperate measures and provoke ethnic conflicts. The anti-Chinese and anti-Chinese violence launched by the Ne Win military government occurred in this context. The overseas Chinese killed by the Ne Win military government have always fought side by side with the revolutionary people of Burma. They are the good children of the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao.

The Ne Win military government is terrified of Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which is achieving victory. To cater to the needs of the leadership of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, the Ne Win military government even insults Chairman Mao, the great leader beloved by the Burmese and world people, and is hostile to the base of world revolution, the People's Republic of China. However, as Chairman Mao said: "No matter how rampant the domestic and foreign reactionaries are (this rampancy is a historical necessity and nothing to be surprised about), we are able to defeat them." This is beyond doubt.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "National struggle, after all, is a class struggle issue." Creating Sino-Burmese conflicts is, in fact, a reflection of class struggle. The life-and-death struggle of the Burmese revolutionary people to thoroughly defeat the reactionary Ne Win military government is a fundamental task of completing the national democratic revolution. The Burmese people must join hands with the Chinese people and the people of the world to thoroughly eliminate imperialism and its running dogs and thoroughly defeat the traitors of the international communist movement—modern revisionism.

In Burmese history, reactionary rulers, in order to maintain their power, always provoke ethnic conflicts. British colonialists once provoked Sino-Burmese conflicts, Indo-Burmese conflicts, and conflicts among domestic ethnic minorities. Japanese fascists also created such ethnic conflicts. During the reactionary Freedom League government period, they also provoked ethnic conflicts to maintain their rule. But they all failed miserably. The various ethnic groups in Burma and the Sino-Burmese and Indo-Burmese peoples have always been friendly, and they have never forgotten the main enemy of the revolution.

Now, the Ne Win military government has blatantly exposed its reactionary true face and will meet the same fate as the aforementioned reactionaries. Today's Burmese people are different from the Burmese people of the past, today's Chinese people are different from the Chinese people of the past, and today's world people are different from the world people of the past. The Ne Win military government, which is anti-China, anti-people, and anti-revolution, will surely meet its doom.

In the past, the modern revisionist leadership of the Soviet Union and Khrushchev of China's beautified and praised the consistently reactionary Ne Win military government in every way, making many people think that the Ne Win military government seemed to be "progressive." Today, under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought and the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the ugly face of the Ne Win military government has been fully exposed. They are trembling in the face of the blazing revolutionary flames of the Burmese people ignited by the Burmese Communist Party and the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. They are making their last struggles and are now in the situation of being chased by everyone like a rat crossing the street. The Ne Win military government is on the verge of collapse.

The Burmese people unite, defeat U.S. imperialism, defeat modern revisionism, and defeat the Ne Win military government!

　　用毛泽东思想武装起来，打倒我们的共同敌人
　　缅甸　郭迎高
    世界上一切革命斗争都是为了夺取政权和巩固政权。在无产阶级专政条件下开展的阶级斗争，也是为了巩固政权。
    毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。中国过去一切革命斗争成效甚少，其基本原因就是因为不能团结真正的朋友，以攻击真正的敌人。”
    几十年来，在根据毛主席这一阶级分析所制定的革命路线的指引下，中国革命取得了一个又一个的胜利。在中国无产阶级文化大革命中，广大革命群众坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，取得了伟大的胜利。
    毛主席著作是反对帝国主义和反对现代修正主义的最强大的武器。马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的威力，就在于它同各国革命的具体实践相结合。如果脱离各国的具体特点而空谈马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，甚至对它的基本原则加以歪曲，那么，根本谈不上正确理解和正确运用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想。
    毛主席说：“学习有两种态度。一种是教条主义的态度，不管我国情况，适用的和不适用的，一起搬来。这种态度不好。另一种态度，学习的时候用脑筋想一下，学那些和我国情况相适合的东西，即吸取对我们有益的经验，我们需要的是这样一种态度。”
    学习毛泽东思想是为了实际运用。我们学习毛泽东思想是为了解决革命的实际问题。我们应该带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影。
    为了要正确地解决本国的革命问题，就必须首先明确本国的社会性质、革命任务、主要矛盾、革命的同盟者和革命的领导，必须以马克思列宁主义的立场、观点和方法，具体地来分析这些问题。
    毛主席说：“既要革命，就要有一个革命党。没有一个革命的党，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”
    领导缅甸革命事业的核心力量是用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的缅甸共产党。这个党以其正确的纲领，领导着缅甸人民，坚持了将近二十年的武装斗争，取得了巨大胜利。
    我们作为一个用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的革命党，和中国共产党一道，坚决同以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义进行毫不动摇的斗争。
    谁是革命领导力量？依靠谁？战胜什么敌人？明确认识和解决这个革命首要问题是关系到能不能取得革命胜利，能不能巩固取得的政权的根本问题。中国的人民民主革命和社会主义革命给我们提供了鲜明的榜样。
      “枪杆子里面出政权”，是夺取政权和建立人民民主政权的重要而正确的指南。当代世界的民族民主革命，如果忘记了这一条，就一定要碰壁。帝国主义及其走狗到处屠杀人民，面对这种情况，那些把希望寄托在他们的“善心”和“明智”上面的人，只能堕落为帝国主义的帮凶——现代修正主义。
    今天，各国民族民主革命的任务主要是反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义及其走狗。各国反动派是帝国主义和封建主义的代理人。缅甸的代理人就是奈温军人政府。虽然他们带着假面具，但是他们是人民的敌人。帝国主义和现代修正主义把他们当作好朋友，给予各种援助。以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义早就成了民族民主革命斗争道路上的障碍。对于这些障碍必须清除，必须进行坚决的斗争。
    在缅甸共产党的领导下，缅甸人民的革命力量正在日益壮大。工人、农民、小资产阶级、知识分子、爱国的资本家、少数民族、被压迫的华侨和印度侨民以及民主人士，正在紧密团结起来。为了打倒主要敌人，为了建立人民民主专政，必须使这些人民在用马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的政党的领导下，钢铁般地团结起来。缅甸革命人民在反对奈温军人政府的同时，也从未放松反对幕后操纵奈温军人政府的美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义。
    随着缅甸民族民主革命运动的高涨，奈温军人政府的政治、经济危机进一步加深了。它为了寻找出路，必然狗急跳墙，要挑起民族冲突。奈温军人政府掀起的反华排华暴行就是在这种背景下发生的。被奈温军人政府杀害的华侨，一向都是同缅甸革命人民并肩进行战斗的。他们是世界人民伟大领袖毛主席的好儿女。
    奈温军人政府，对毛泽东思想，对正在取得胜利的中国无产阶级文化大革命怕得要死。为了迎合美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义领导集团的需要，奈温军人政府竟然侮辱缅甸人民和世界人民敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，敌视世界革命的根据地中华人民共和国。但是，正如毛主席所说的：“不管中外反动派如何猖獗（这种猖獗是历史必然性，毫不足奇），我们是能够战胜他们的。”这是毫无疑问的。
    毛主席教导我们：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”制造中缅冲突，实际上是阶级斗争的一种反映。缅甸革命人民所进行的彻底打倒反动的奈温军人政府的你死我活的斗争，是完成民族民主革命的一项根本任务。缅甸人民一定要同中国人民和世界人民携起手来，彻底铲除帝国主义及其走狗，彻底打倒国际共产主义运动的叛徒——现代修正主义。
    在缅甸历史上，反动的统治者为了维持自己的政权，总是挑起民族冲突。英国殖民主义者，过去就曾经挑起中缅冲突和印缅冲突以及国内少数民族之间的冲突。日本法西斯也制造过这样的民族冲突。在反动的自由同盟政府时期也同样，他们为了维持他们的统治，制造民族冲突。但是，他们都可耻地失败了。缅甸各民族之间以及中缅、印缅人民之间，从来都是友好的，他们从来都没有忘记革命的主要敌人。
    现在，奈温军人政府已赤裸裸地暴露了它的反动的真面目，它必将遭受到与上述反动派同样的结局。今天的缅甸人民已经和过去的缅甸人民不同了，今天的中国人民和过去的中国人民不同了，今天的世界人民和过去的世界人民不同了。奈温军人政府反华、反人民、反革命，必将自取灭亡。
    过去，苏联现代修正主义领导集团和中国的赫鲁晓夫对一贯反动的奈温军人政府的百般美化和吹捧，使不少人产生了这样一种印象，即奈温军人政府似乎是“进步的”。今天在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的形势下，奈温军人政府的狰狞面目已经原形毕露。他们在缅甸共产党燃起的缅甸人民的革命烽火愈烧愈烈和中国无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的形势面前，吓得发抖。他们正在作垂死挣扎，他们已经处于老鼠过街人人喊打的境地。奈温军人政府已经朝不保夕了。
    缅甸人民团结起来，打倒美帝国主义，打倒现代修正主义，打倒奈温军人政府！
