In the midst of a new upsurge in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the nation's hundreds of millions of military and civilians are filled with joy and pride, holding various celebrations to welcome the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army. Soldiers, militiamen, and revolutionary masses who have fought side by side to defend the motherland and in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are studying Chairman Mao's great military theories together, discussing the deep friendships forged in battle, and resolutely carrying out Chairman Mao's great call to "support the army and cherish the people." They will further strengthen military-civilian unity and make new contributions to defending the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In the capital, a lively and solemn atmosphere prevails in celebrating the "August 1" Army Day. The broad masses of soldiers and civilians in the various headquarters, military branches, and armed forces of the People's Liberation Army, as well as revolutionary workers, peasants, Red Guards, and cadre in Beijing, have been fervently studying and propagating Chairman Mao's brilliant military thoughts in recent days. The broad masses of military and civilians enthusiastically shout: Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years! From the majestic Tiananmen Gate to the streets and alleys of the capital, from factories to rural communes and schools, there are large character slogans everywhere reading, "Wishing Chairman Mao a long life!" "Long live the People's Liberation Army!" "Learn from the People's Liberation Army!" "Salute to the People's Liberation Army!"

In Shanghai, a joyful atmosphere of military love for the people and civilian support for the military prevails everywhere. The Shanghai Revolutionary Committee issued a notice calling for various units and revolutionary organizations to carry out activities to support the military and care for veterans, to widely learn from the glorious traditions and excellent qualities of the People's Liberation Army, and to deeply criticize the Chinese Khrushchev. The three military forces stationed in Shanghai have launched a week of activities to support the government and love the people. The propaganda teams organized by various units, together with revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, have performed artistic programs praising the great leader Chairman Mao, praising the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and denouncing the Chinese Khrushchev. The Shanghai Garrison Command also held a meeting to exchange experiences of activists who studied Chairman Mao's works actively in the "three supports and two militaries," determined to carry out a thorough criticism and struggle against the Chinese Khrushchev with the broad revolutionary masses, and to launch a new upsurge of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle between the two lines.

In Tianjin, the broad revolutionary masses and the Tianjin garrison have also extensively carried out activities to support the military and love the people in recent days. Many factories, schools, and neighborhood residents have invited the garrison to hold symposiums and banquets, asking the soldiers to talk about the glorious fighting history of the People's Liberation Army over the past 40 years and to share their experiences of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, firmly establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

In Shandong, Shanxi, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, and other places, the garrison and revolutionary masses have been holding various celebrations in recent days. Many units have sent representatives to revolutionary organizations and revolutionary masses to solicit opinions on the "three supports and two militaries"; many revolutionary organizations have sent condolence teams to visit the troops. The Shandong Revolutionary Committee, the leadership of the Jinan Military Region, the Shandong Military District, the Shandong Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Headquarters, the Shandong Red Guards Headquarters, and the Shandong Red Guards Art Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters, together with other revolutionary organizations, jointly arranged celebrations for the days before and after "August 1." In the streets of Jinan, many cultural warriors performed artistic programs, propagating the significance of the "August 1" Army Day and Chairman Mao's military thoughts and military line. The soldiers and civilians of a certain naval unit stationed in Qingdao held a joint celebration of supporting the military and loving the people, studying Chairman Mao's works together, and unanimously expressing their determination to unite, fight, and win together, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, and to build the local area into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

In Hohhot, Xining, Kunming, Chengdu, and other places, a lively scene of military love for the people and civilian support for the military has also appeared. The "August 18" revolutionary masses and people of all ethnic groups in Qinghai formed a condolence team, which visited the garrison troops who had made outstanding achievements in the "three supports and two militaries" over the past few days. At the reports held by the garrison, revolutionary youngsters were also invited to introduce their heroic deeds in the Cultural Revolution. Many revolutionary organizations in Chengdu held report meetings, inviting local garrison activists who studied and applied Chairman Mao's works to share their experiences and insights. In Hohhot, a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army executing the "left support" mission reviewed Chairman Mao's sayings about the people's army, and everyone expressed their determination to seriously and repeatedly study Chairman Mao's military thoughts and military line, to resolutely complete the glorious task of the "three supports and two militaries" assigned by Chairman Mao, and to do new deeds for the people. In Hebei, Henan, Jiangxi, Guangxi, and other places, the 4800th, 8250th, 8212th, 601st, and 6955th units have recently held various activities to commemorate the "August 1" Army Day with the local revolutionary masses.
