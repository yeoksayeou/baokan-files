A workshop at the Qingdao Four Square Locomotive Factory had two combat organizations. One was the "Frontline Command Center," which followed Chairman Mao's teachings and firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, aiming their struggle at the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road. The other combat organization, due to some differing views with the "Frontline Command Center," sometimes directed their struggle against the "Frontline Command Center."

One morning, workers from the "Frontline Command Center" entered the workshop and saw a new big slogan: "The Frontline Command Center must collapse!" Some workers were immediately enraged, saying, "If someone doesn't provoke us, we won't provoke them. But if they provoke us, we must retaliate. They provoked us first, so we must hit back with a slogan of our own!" Many workers around did not agree with this view. However, a few workers, feeling indignant, insisted, "If we let them have their way, won't we appear weak and helpless?" Thus, they rolled up their sleeves and, right next to that big slogan, wrote a retaliatory big slogan aimed directly at the opposing organization.

After a while, the leader of the "Frontline Command Center" arrived at the workshop. Upon seeing this scene, he immediately thought of Chairman Mao's teachings: "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is a question of first importance in the revolution." He also recalled the military representative's frequent advice to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and concentrate forces to carry out revolutionary criticism. For mass organizations with differing views, one must, on the premise of a unified direction, "seek common ground while reserving differences." Although that combat organization had differing views with the "Frontline Command Center," this was an internal contradiction among the people. If we retaliate with an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth, engaging in direct confrontation, we would fall into the trap set by the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, causing pain to our friends and joy to our enemies. Thinking this, he said to everyone, "Comrades, we must listen to Chairman Mao's words and unite all forces that can be united to jointly fight the enemy. They are wrong, and we must not follow their mistakes." Saying this, he immediately had a few comrades cover the retaliatory slogan against that combat organization with two big white slogans: "Listen to Chairman Mao's words, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle!" and "Overthrow the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road!"

That evening, the leader of the "Frontline Command Center" discussed this matter with everyone, conducting a study and discussion session. This allowed all comrades to attend a living class on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and grasping the direction of the struggle.

　　一条大标语的小故事
    青岛四方机车厂的一个车间，有两个战斗组织。一个是“前线指挥部”，这个组织遵照毛主席的教导，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，把斗争矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。另一个战斗组织由于某些观点和“前线指挥部”有分歧，有些人有时却把矛头指向了“前线指挥部”。
    一天早晨，“前线指挥部”的工人一进车间，就看到一条新的大标语：“前线指挥部非垮不可！”有些工人一看就火了，气愤地说：“人不犯我，我不犯人，人若犯我，我必犯人。他先来侵犯我们，咱也得回他一条！”周围不少工人不同意这个意见。但是，有几个工人忿忿不平地坚持说：“咱让了他，不显得软弱无能吗？”于是，他们不顾许多同志的劝阻，挽起袖子，就在这张大标语旁边写了一条针锋相对回击对方的大标语。
    过了一会儿，“前线指挥部”的负责人来到车间。他一见这个情景，脑子里马上闪现出毛主席的谆谆教导：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”他还想到驻军代表经常讲的，要紧紧掌握斗争大方向，集中力量进行革命的大批判。对于持有不同观点的群众组织，一定要在大方向一致的前提下，“求大同，存小异”。那个战斗组织虽然和“前线指挥部”有意见分歧，但这是人民内部矛盾，如果以眼还眼，以牙还牙，针锋相对地干起来，就上了党内走资本主义道路当权派的当，就会使亲者痛，仇者快。想到这里，他就对大家说：“同志们，咱们一定要听毛主席的话，团结一切可以团结的力量，共同对敌。他们错了，我们决不能跟着错下去。”说着，他马上和几个同志在那条针锋相对地反击那个战斗组织的标语上面，用白颜色浓浓地盖上了两条大标语：“听毛主席的话，紧紧掌握斗争大方向！”“打倒党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派！”
    当天晚上，“前线指挥部”负责人就这件事和大家一起进行了学习和讨论，使全体同志又上了一堂活学活用毛主席著作、掌握斗争大方向的政治课。
