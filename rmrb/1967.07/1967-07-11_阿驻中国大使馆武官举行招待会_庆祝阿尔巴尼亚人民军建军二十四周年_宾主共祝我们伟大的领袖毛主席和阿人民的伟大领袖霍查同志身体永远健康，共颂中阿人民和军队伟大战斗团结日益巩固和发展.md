Albanian Military Attache Holds Reception to Celebrate the 24th Anniversary of the Founding of the Albanian People's Army
Guests and Hosts Together Wish for the Everlasting Health of Our Great Leader Chairman Mao and the Great Leader of the Albanian People, Comrade Enver Hoxha, and Praise the Ever-Strengthening and Developing Great Combat Unity Between the Peoples and Armies of China and Albania

BEIJING, July 10 (Xinhua) — Albanian Military Attache Hatue held a reception tonight to celebrate the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian People's Army. Vice Premier Chen Yi and Vice Chairman of the National Defense Council Ye Jianying, among others, were invited to attend. Albanian Ambassador to China Nataneli was also present.

At the reception, filled with revolutionary friendship and combat unity, the hosts and guests together praised the unbreakable great combat unity between the peoples and armies of China and Albania, which is becoming increasingly solid and developing. They raised their glasses in toast to the everlasting health of our great leader Chairman Mao and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha.

Comrade Hatue, in his speech, expressed the Albanian people's deep respect and ardent love for the outstanding leader of the Chinese people and the greatest friend of the Albanian people, Chairman Mao Zedong, and his close comrade-in-arms, Vice Chairman Lin Biao.

He said that the Albanian people's army is vigilant and prepared to smash any provocations and armed adventures by imperialism and its lackeys, the revisionists, and the reactionaries of various countries. He pointed out that our army and people will always stand on the side of revolution, on the side of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and will honorably fulfill their duty to oppose any enemy, under any circumstances and at any time.

Comrade Hatue, in discussing the current international situation, pointed out that at a time when the crisis of imperialism and modern revisionism is deepening, when the most reactionary and biggest representative of the contemporary era, U.S. imperialism, and Soviet revisionism are making deals to rule and divide the world, we are pleased to note that the heroic struggle of the brotherly Vietnamese people has the sincere and unconditional support of 700 million Chinese people and is progressing victoriously. The revolutionary waves sweeping through Southeast Asia and the Arab countries and the waves of struggle for freedom are creating conditions for expanding the front against imperialism and revisionism. The destructive activities of Soviet revisionism are being increasingly exposed. It is now clear that the only way to get rid of domestic fascist rule and free oneself from the clutches of U.S. imperialism is to wage people's armed struggle.

Comrade Hatue strongly condemned U.S. imperialism's continuous war provocations against China, the white terror imposed by British imperialism on the Chinese people in Hong Kong, and the provocative activities of the reactionaries in India, Indonesia, and Burma, instigated by U.S. imperialism in full collusion with Soviet revisionism. He said, we are firmly convinced that these tricks will never succeed and will all meet with a shameful failure.

Comrade Hatue praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which has exposed the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. He said that the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in China have grasped the Marxist-Leninist thoughts of Chairman Mao, making great China an impregnable fortress. The dream of Soviet modern revisionism to seize this fortress from within has completely collapsed. He said that the Albanian people and the Albanian people's army are extremely pleased with the brilliant victories achieved by the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army under the wise leadership of the Communist Party of China with Comrade Mao Zedong as its head in recent years. He wished the brotherly Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army even greater victories in all fields. Comrade Hatue, in expounding on the eternal brotherly friendship between the parties and peoples of Albania and China, and between the armies of the two countries, pointed out that this friendship will certainly develop and strengthen in our common struggle against U.S. imperialism, against revisionism, and against the reactionaries of various countries, and in our common cause of building socialism.

Comrade Li Tianyou, Deputy Chief of the General Staff of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extended the warmest congratulations to the brotherly Albanian people and all the comrades-in-arms of the Albanian people's army. He praised the heroic Albanian people's army, which, under the correct leadership of the tried and tested, glorious Albanian Party of Labor headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, has gone through a glorious combat course and, together with the people, has achieved new great feats for the socialist revolution and socialist construction of the Albanian people.

He said that the comrades-in-arms of the Albanian people's army have actively responded to the call of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor and Comrade Enver Hoxha, raised high the banner of the cultural revolution, further highlighted proletarian politics, and taken a series of major revolutionary measures, greatly promoting the thought revolutionization of all officers and soldiers. This not only powerfully promoted the construction of the Albanian people's army in all fields but will also certainly further consolidate the proletarian dictatorship of Albania. The Chinese People's Liberation Army feels extremely honored and proud to have the Albanian people's army as such a close comrade-in-arms.

Comrade Li Tianyou pointed out that the heroic Albanian people and the Albanian people's army, under the wise leadership of the Albanian Party of Labor headed by Comrade Enver Hoxha, have always firmly held high the banner of Marxism-Leninism and proletarian internationalism, the banner of struggle against U.S. imperialism, and have waged a resolute struggle against the U.S. aggressors and their lackeys, and against the modern revisionist traitor and renegade clique centered on the leadership of the CPSU. They have made great contributions to the world people's revolutionary cause and the international communist movement.

In discussing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, which is advancing with great momentum, he pointed out that all the officers and soldiers of our army are enthusiastically responding to Chairman Mao's great call, resolutely completing the glorious tasks of supporting the left, supporting industry, supporting agriculture, military control, and military training; enthusiastically responding to the call of Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, Comrade Lin Biao, pushing the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, and making our army into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought that is red all over. We will forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and resolutely carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

He said that at present, the world has entered the great new era of Mao Zedong Thought. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is increasingly penetrating people's hearts and has become a powerful ideological weapon for the people of the world to oppose imperialism and modern revisionism. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries are terrified and hateful of the great Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. They have formed a new "holy alliance" against communism, against China, against the people, and against revolution, and have staged one anti-China farce after another. However, just as the wings of a crow cannot cover the sun, their sabotage will never be able to stop the victory of Mao Zedong Thought throughout the world. All anti-China clowns will not have a good ending!

Comrade Li Tianyou enthusiastically praised the combat friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Albania. He said that the peoples and armies of China and Albania, for the common revolutionary goal, will forever stand together, fight together, and win together.

Among those invited to attend the reception were also responsible comrades from various departments, branches, and services of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, and the Beijing Garrison, such as Wang Xinting, Yuan Ziqin, Zhang Xianyue, Zhao Qimin, and Wang Huijiu. Responsible comrades from relevant departments, such as Zhao Yimin, Qiao Guanhua, Yang Lin, and Zhou Yiping, as well as representatives of the revolutionary masses and the Red Guards, also attended the reception.

    阿驻中国大使馆武官举行招待会
    庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民军建军二十四周年
    宾主共祝我们伟大的领袖毛主席和阿人民的伟大领袖霍查同志身体永远健康，共颂中阿人民和军队伟大战斗团结日益巩固和发展
    新华社十日讯　阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使馆武官哈图今晚为庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民军建军二十四周年举行招待会。国务院副总理陈毅、国防委员会副主席叶剑英等应邀出席了招待会。阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使纳塔奈利出席作陪。
    在充满革命友谊和战斗团结气氛的招待会上，宾主共颂中阿两国人民和两国军队之间牢不可破的伟大战斗团结日益巩固和发展，不断举杯为我们伟大的领袖毛主席和阿尔巴尼亚人民伟大的领袖恩维尔·霍查同志的健康干杯！
    哈图同志在讲话中表达了阿尔巴尼亚人民对中国人民的杰出领袖、阿尔巴尼亚人民的最伟大的朋友毛泽东主席和他的亲密战友林彪副主席的崇高的敬意和热烈的爱戴。
    他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民军警惕并准备粉碎帝国主义及其仆从修正主义和各国反动派的任何挑衅和武装冒险。他指出，我国军队和我国人民无论在什么情况下，在任何时候，永远都站在革命的一边，站在马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的一边，永远光荣地履行自己反对任何敌人的义务。
    哈图同志在谈到当前国际形势时指出，在帝国主义和现代修正主义的危机大大深化的时候，在当代最反动的最大代表美帝国主义和苏联修正主义为了统治世界、瓜分世界而作交易的时候，我们满意地指出兄弟的越南人民的英雄斗争得到七亿中国人民真诚的、毫无保留的支持，并正在胜利地进行。席卷东南亚和阿拉伯各国的革命浪潮和争取自由斗争的浪潮正在为扩大反对帝国主义和修正主义阵线创造条件。苏联修正主义的破坏活动日益被揭露。现在已经很清楚，要摆脱国内法西斯统治和从美帝国主义的魔爪之下解放出来，唯一的道路就是开展人民的武装斗争。
    哈图同志强烈谴责美帝国主义对中国不断进行战争挑衅，谴责英帝国主义对香港中国人民实行白色恐怖，谴责美帝国主义同苏联修正主义充分默契下唆使印度、印尼、缅甸的反动派对中国人民的挑衅活动。他说，我们深信，这些伎俩是决不会得逞的，所有这些伎俩都将遭到可耻的失败。
    哈图同志赞扬中国的无产阶级文化大革命，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揪了出来。他说，中国亿万革命群众掌握了毛主席的马克思列宁主义的思想，使伟大的人民中国成为一个牢不可破的堡垒，苏联现代修正主义妄想从内部夺取这个堡垒的梦想完全破灭了。他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民军对中国人民和中国人民解放军在以伟大的导师毛泽东主席为首的中国共产党的英明领导下，近几年来所取得的辉煌胜利感到无限的高兴。他祝兄弟的中国人民和中国人民解放军在各个方面取得更加辉煌的胜利。哈图同志在畅述阿中两国党和人民、两国军队之间的永恒的兄弟友谊时指出，这种友谊在我们共同反对美帝国主义、反对修正主义和各国反动派的战斗中，在建设社会主义的共同事业中，必将日益发展和巩固。
    中国人民解放军副总参谋长李天佑代表中国人民解放军全体指战员，向兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民军全体战友，表示最热烈的祝贺。他赞扬英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民军，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的、久经考验的、光荣的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的正确领导下，经历了光辉的战斗历程，并和人民一道为阿尔巴尼亚人民的社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业，建立了新的丰功伟绩。
    他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民军战友们，积极响应了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会和恩维尔·霍查同志的号召，高举思想文化革命的旗帜，进一步突出无产阶级政治，采取了一系列重大的革命化措施，大大地促进了全体指战员的思想革命化。这不仅有力地推动了阿尔巴尼亚人民军各方面的建设，而且也必然进一步巩固阿尔巴尼亚的无产阶级专政。中国人民解放军为有阿尔巴尼亚人民军这样的亲密战友而感到无比的光荣和自豪。
    李天佑指出，英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民和阿尔巴尼亚人民军，在以恩维尔·霍查同志为首的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党的英明领导下，一贯坚定地高举马克思列宁主义和无产阶级国际主义的革命旗帜，高举反对美帝国主义的战斗旗帜，同美国侵略者及其走狗，同以苏共领导为中心的现代修正主义叛徒工贼集团进行了坚决的斗争，对世界人民革命事业和国际共产主义运动作出了巨大贡献。
    他在谈到我们的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的我国无产阶级文化大革命，正在乘胜前进时指出，我军全体指战员正在热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，坚决完成支左、支工、支农、军管、军训的光荣任务；正在热烈响应毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志的号召，把我军活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新的阶段，把我军办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。我们永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    他说，目前，世界已经进入了毛泽东思想的伟大新时代。战无不胜的毛泽东思想，日益深入人心，已成为全世界人民反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的强大思想武器。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派对伟大的毛泽东思想，对中国的无产阶级文化大革命，怕得要死，恨得要命。他们结成一个反共、反华、反人民、反革命的新的“神圣同盟”，演出了一出出的反华丑剧。但是，正如乌鸦的翅膀遮不住太阳一样，他们的捣乱绝对阻挡不了毛泽东思想在全世界的胜利。一切反华小丑都是不会有好下场的！
    李天佑热烈颂扬中阿两国人民和军队的战斗友谊。他说，中阿两国人民和军队，为着共同的革命目标，将永远团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    应邀出席招待会的还有中国人民解放军各总部、军种、兵种和北京部队负责人王新亭、袁子钦、张贤约、赵启民、王辉球等。有关方面负责人赵毅敏、乔冠华、杨琳、周一萍以及无产阶级革命派和红卫兵代表也出席了招待会。
