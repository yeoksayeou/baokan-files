Wangyuan Brigade in Anhui Province's Weigou Commune, following Chairman Mao's instructions, has risen to criticize the bourgeoisie. They have mobilized the commune members to recall the history of the struggle between the two roads in rural areas and severely criticized the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev in attempting to restore capitalism.

The brigade's poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses of commune members, following Chairman Mao's directive to "criticize the bourgeoisie" in communes, have raised high the banner of the revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought. They have taken the struggle between the two roads as the guiding principle and used various forms such as propaganda teams, cartoons, big-character posters, field meetings, family meetings, and denunciation meetings. They have combined recalling bitterness and sweetness, presenting ironclad facts, and severely criticized and exposed the heinous crimes of the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road in attempting to restore capitalism in rural areas. Through the criticism, the broad masses of peasants have greatly raised their socialist consciousness and launched a new wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of Wangyuan Brigade suffered deeply from exploitation and oppression before liberation. Almost every family had to work as long-term or short-term laborers, pay rent and debts, flee from famine, and beg for food. In the revolutionary criticism, they recalled these bloody and tearful histories from before liberation, filled with class hatred, and severely criticized and refuted the evil words and deeds of the biggest power-holder within the Party who is attempting to restore capitalism in rural areas.

The poor and lower-middle peasants recalled the situation of the struggle between the two roads when they established cooperatives in 1955. At that time, our great leader Chairman Mao praised the shining example of three poor peasants in Anping County, Hebei Province, who insisted on establishing cooperatives. Chairman Mao pointed out: "The direction represented by these three poor peasants is the direction for the 500 million peasants nationwide." The poor and lower-middle peasants of Wangyuan Brigade resolutely followed the direction indicated by Chairman Mao and quickly organized agricultural cooperatives. However, soon after, a strange wind blew in from somewhere, claiming that cooperatives were "established too early," "rushed," and "exceeded the level of the masses' consciousness and the leadership ability of the cadres," and that they should be "resolutely contracted." A small clique within the local Party who were taking the capitalist road immediately responded, using the pretext of "opposing rash advancement" to force the cadres and the poor and lower-middle peasants to dissolve the cooperatives. Some rich peasants, incited by local landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, rushed to withdraw from the cooperatives. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants resolutely refused to take a step backward. They held large and small meetings to debate with those who opposed the cooperatives. Soon, Chairman Mao firmly criticized this right-opportunist behavior, stopping this strange wind. At that time, Zhang Zhendong, who served as the deputy director of the cooperative, recalled this history: "At that time, I didn't understand how the wind could blow so strongly. Now I understand that it was stirred up by the Chinese Khrushchev. We must now thoroughly settle his accounts." A poor peasant said: "No matter how strong the evil wind is, it cannot overcome the east wind. With Chairman Mao backing us, we have already started from establishing cooperatives to establishing people's communes. The Chinese Khrushchev's plot to lead us peasants down the capitalist evil path has completely failed. Now, we must uproot this revisionist root!"

In the criticism, the poor and lower-middle peasants severely exposed the evil plot of the biggest power-holder within the Party who was advocating "three freedoms and one contract." The poor and lower-middle peasants angrily said: "Three freedoms and one contract" is the evil plan of the biggest power-holder within the Party to sabotage socialism and restore capitalism. This plan is to make "one family happy, ten thousand families cry," allowing landlords and rich peasants to defecate on the heads of the poor again! The production brigade leader, Fan Huai'de, said: "My family was the poorest before liberation. My father died from overwork, and I started begging at the age of four. Four of my five siblings starved to death. 'Three freedoms and one contract' is the same as individual farming, the same as taking a step backward. We will not agree to it in a thousand ways, nor in ten thousand ways!" The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, in the criticism, recalled the scene of the local small clique within the Party who were taking the capitalist road fiercely advocating "responsibility fields." Those scoundrels, to deceive the masses, had fabricated ten "advantages" and eight "benefits" of it. At that time, the poor and lower-middle peasants refuted: If the land is distributed to households, what about the five-guarantee households? What about the families of martyrs, military personnel, workers, and cadres? What about the poor and lower-middle peasants without labor power? Isn't this sabotaging the relationship between the military and the people, between workers and peasants, and between cadres and the masses? Isn't this making the poor jump into the fire pit again? They stood up straight and fought against those scoundrels, insisting on taking the socialist road. That year, the brigade relied on the collective's strength to overcome temporary economic difficulties. After recalling this history of the struggle between the two roads, the poor and lower-middle peasants hated the biggest power-holder within the Party who was taking the capitalist road and his agents in Anhui even more. The representative of the poor and lower-middle peasants, Ren Shilian, said: "The household contract responsibility system stimulates the enthusiasm of landlords and rich peasants for exploitation, develops the rich peasant economy, and takes the capitalist road, making the landlords and rich peasants happy and the poor and lower-middle peasants angry." Everyone resolutely declared that they must criticize and expose the behind-the-scenes boss of the small clique within the Party who were taking the capitalist road, making him never be able to turn over a new leaf!

The poor and lower-middle peasants and the broad masses of commune members of Wangyuan Brigade have greatly raised their socialist consciousness through the revolutionary criticism. They love our great leader Chairman Mao even more and worship the great Mao Zedong Thought even more, launching a new wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. This brigade has 13 production teams, which have organized 14 Mao Zedong Thought propaganda teams. Due to the widespread promotion of Mao Zedong Thought, people's ideological revolutionization has been greatly promoted, new people and new things have emerged in large numbers, and production has been thriving.

    王圩大队遵照毛主席教导奋起批判资产阶级
    发动社员回忆农村两条道路斗争历史
    狠批中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义罪行
    本报讯　安徽省濉溪县五沟公社王圩大队贫下中农和广大社员，遵照毛主席公社农民“也要批判资产阶级”的指示，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判旗帜，以两条道路斗争为纲，广泛利用宣传队、漫画、大字报、田头会、家庭会、控诉会等多种形式，结合忆苦思甜，摆出铁一般的事实，从政治上、思想上、理论上狠揭狠批党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在农村复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。通过大批判，广大农民群众大大提高了社会主义觉悟，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。
    王圩大队的贫下中农，解放前受剥削、受压迫很深很重，差不多家家打长工，卖短工，交租背债，逃荒要饭。他们在革命的大批判中，回忆起解放前这些血泪斑斑的历史，满怀阶级仇恨，狠批痛驳党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派妄图在农村复辟资本主义的罪恶言行。
    贫下中农回忆了一九五五年办合作社时两条道路斗争的情况。当时，我们伟大的领袖毛主席表扬了河北省安平县三户贫农坚持办合作社的光辉事例。毛主席指出：“这三户贫农所表示的方向，就是全国五亿农民的方向。”王圩大队贫下中农坚决按照毛主席指引的方向前进，迅速组织起了农业合作社。但是不久，不知从哪里刮来了一股阴风，胡说什么合作社“搞早了”，“冒进了”，“超过了群众觉悟的水平和干部领导能力的水平”，要“坚决收缩”。当地党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派也应声而起，以要“反急躁冒进”为名，强迫干部和贫下中农解散合作社。一部分富裕农民在地富反坏分子唆使下纷纷退社。广大贫下中农坚决不走回头路。他们开大会小会同反对合作社的人展开大辩论。不久，毛主席坚决批判了这种右倾机会主义言行，煞住了这股歪风。当时担任合作社副社长的张振东在回述这段历史时说：“当时不明白‘风’怎么刮得那么大，现在才明白这是中国的赫鲁晓夫煽起来的。我们现在一定要彻底清算他的罪行。”一位贫农说：“妖风再大，大不过东风。有毛主席撑腰，我们已经从办合作社办起了人民公社。中国的赫鲁晓夫想把我们农民引上资本主义邪路的阴谋完全失败了。现在，我们一定要把这个修正主义老根拔掉！”
    贫下中农在大批判中大揭党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派鼓吹“三自一包”的罪恶阴谋。贫下中农愤怒地说：“三自一包”是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派破坏社会主义、复辟资本主义的罪恶计划，这个计划是叫“一家欢乐，万家哭”，让地主、富农再在穷人头上屙屎啊！生产大队长范怀德说：“我家解放前最穷，父亲打长工累死了，我四岁开始要饭，兄妹五个饿死四个。‘三自一包’就是单干，就是走回头路，我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应！”广大贫下中农在大批判中回忆了当地党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派拚命宣扬“责任田”的情景。那一小撮家伙为了欺骗群众，曾胡诌什么它有十大“优越”、八大“好处”。当时贫下中农就反驳说：分田到户，五保户怎么办？烈属、军属、工人家属、干部家属怎么办？没有劳力的贫下中农怎么办？这难道不是破坏军民关系、工农关系、干群关系吗？难道不是叫穷人再跳火坑吗？他们理直气壮地与那一小撮坏家伙进行了斗争，坚持走社会主义道路。那一年，这个大队依靠集体的力量，克服了暂时的经济困难。贫下中农们回忆了这段两条道路斗争的历史后，更加痛恨党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他在安徽的代理人。贫下中农代表任世连说：“包产到户调动的是地主、富农剥削的积极性，发展的是富农经济，走的是资本主义道路，乐在地富心上，恨在贫下中农肚里。”大家坚决表示，一定要把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的总后台批倒批臭，叫他永世不能翻身！
    王圩大队贫下中农和广大社员在革命的大批判中，社会主义觉悟空前提高。他们对伟大的领袖毛主席更加热爱，对伟大的毛泽东思想更加崇拜，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。这个大队十三个生产队，共组织了十四个毛泽东思想宣传队。由于毛泽东思想大普及，大大促进了人的思想革命化，新人新事层出不穷，生产蒸蒸日上。
