Khrushchev's Self-Exposure

Khrushchev held two secret talks with the U.S. imperialist chief Johnson, concluding a deal to betray the Arab people and the people of the world. After returning from Glassboro to New York, Khrushchev immediately held a press conference at the United Nations, issuing a statement that emphasized the "deep differences" between the Soviet Union and the United States, attempting to cover up the treacherous actions of the Soviet revisionist clique. However, it was precisely at this press conference that he exposed himself, revealing his conspiracy to collude with U.S. imperialism and betray the Arab people.

At the press conference, Khrushchev repeatedly emphasized that "the United Nations should pass a resolution for Israel to withdraw its troops." This means that Khrushchev had significantly watered down his four-point proposal made at the recent United Nations emergency meeting, omitting clauses such as resolutely condemning Israel's aggressive actions and demanding that Israel compensate the Arab countries for their losses. Khrushchev's flip-flopping, changing his tune within days, is indeed cunning and deceitful.

Even retaining the demand for Israel to withdraw its troops, Khrushchev did so only to set the stage for what follows. He said that if Israel's troops do not withdraw, "the issue of restricting the supply of weapons to the Near East countries and the issue of guaranteeing rights and freedom of navigation cannot be resolved." In other words, as long as Israel's troops withdraw, the unreasonable demands made by U.S. imperialism, such as "restricting the supply of weapons to the Near East countries" and "guaranteeing" Israel's existence as a state and its "freedom of navigation" in the Suez Canal and the Gulf of Aqaba, can all be resolved. Is this not the most despicable betrayal of the Arab people?

Furthermore, Khrushchev advocated that the Security Council should "supervise" the United Nations' decisions regarding the Middle East situation. "If one of the parties involved refuses to implement the decision, it will have to be sanctioned by the Security Council." What a "party involved"! This means that if the Arab countries refuse the unreasonable decisions passed by the United Nations under the collusion of the United States and the Soviet Union, the Security Council, controlled by the United States and the Soviet Union, will impose "sanctions" on the Arab countries. The conspiracy of the Soviet revisionist clique, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, to use the United Nations to force the Arab countries to submit, is laid bare here.

According to U.S. media reports, Johnson had proposed a "package plan" to Khrushchev to resolve the Middle East issue, which included Israel's withdrawal of troops, the Arab countries' "recognition of Israel as a state," Israel's "right to navigate through international waterways," "restricting the arms race in the Middle East," and "keeping the United Nations effectively in the Middle East." Khrushchev's remarks at the press conference perfectly aligned with this "package plan." This proves that Khrushchev and Johnson had struck a dirty deal on the Middle East issue. Khrushchev, behind the backs of the Arab people, shamelessly betrayed their interests.

Throughout the entire event of U.S. imperialism and its lackey Israel invading Arab countries, the Soviet revisionist clique has played every trick in the book, using two-faced and honey-tongued tactics. However, since they are counter-revolutionaries, they cannot help but expose their counter-revolutionary faces. No matter what methods Khrushchev and his ilk use to cover up their treacherous deeds, they can only, as the old Chinese saying goes, "the more they cover up, the more they reveal."

### 柯西金的自我暴露

　　柯西金的自我暴露
    柯西金同美帝头子约翰逊两次密谈，做成了出卖阿拉伯人民和全世界人民的大交易。柯西金从葛拉斯堡罗回到纽约，马上在联合国举行记者招待会，发表了一个大谈苏美之间存在“深刻的分歧”的声明，竭力想要遮掩苏修集团的叛卖勾当。但是，他正是在这次记者招待会上作了一次自我暴露，和盘托出了他勾结美帝国主义、出卖阿拉伯人民的阴谋。
    柯西金在记者招待会上一再强调，“联合国应当通过以色列撤军的决定”。这就是说，柯西金把他刚刚在联合国紧急会议中提出的四点提案打了个一折七扣，什么坚决谴责以色列的侵略行动、要求以色列赔偿阿拉伯国家的损失等等条款，都通通“割爱”了。柯西金出尔反尔，相隔几天就改了调子，真是多“谋”善变。
    柯西金还保留要求以色列撤军这一条，也只不过是为了好做下面的文章。他说，如果以色列的军队不撤退，
  “关于限制向近东各国提供武器的问题以及关于保障权利和通航自由的问题便不能解决”。换句话说，只要以色列的军队撤退，美帝国主义提出的所谓“限制向近东各国提供武器”、“保障”以色列作为一个国家存在并且获得在苏伊士运河和亚喀巴湾“通航自由”等等无理要求，便都可以解决。这不是对阿拉伯人民最卑鄙的背叛吗？
    不仅这样，柯西金还主张应当由安理会来“监督”联合国通过的有关中东局势的决定，“如果这一决定涉及的一方拒绝实现的话，就不得不通过安理会对它实行制裁”。好一个“决定涉及的一方”！这就是说，如果阿拉伯国家拒绝联合国在美苏勾结下通过的无理决定，美苏操纵下的安理会就要对阿拉伯国家“实行制裁”。苏修集团伙同美帝国主义利用联合国来迫使阿拉伯国家就范的阴谋，在这里赤裸裸地暴露无遗了。
    据美国报刊透露，约翰逊曾向柯西金提出了一个解决中东问题的“一揽子方案”，其中包括以色列撤军、阿拉伯国家“承认以色列是一个国家”、以色列“有权通过国际航道”、在中东“限制军备竞赛”、“使联合国有效地呆在中东”等等。柯西金在记者招待会上的讲话，同这个“一揽子方案”完全合拍。这证明柯西金同约翰逊在中东问题上已做成了一笔肮脏的交易。柯西金背着阿拉伯人民，无耻地出卖了他们的利益。
    苏修集团在美帝国主义及其走狗以色列侵略阿拉伯国家的整个事件中，耍尽了两面三刀、口蜜腹剑的伎俩。但是，他们既要反革命，就不可能不暴露出自己的反革命面目。柯西金之流不管用什么手法来掩饰自己的叛卖行径，都只能是象中国老话所说的，欲盖弥彰！
