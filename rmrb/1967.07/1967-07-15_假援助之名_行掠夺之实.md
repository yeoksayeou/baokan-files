The leaders of the Soviet revisionist clique always present themselves as "saviors" to the independent nations of Asia and Africa. They constantly talk about "aid," shouting it from the rooftops. They boast endlessly that as long as the independent nations of Asia and Africa rely on their "aid," they can usher in a "new era of economic development," even paving a "smooth path to socialism." Otherwise, without the "aid" of the Soviet revisionists, they would simply not be able to survive.

However, from the true facts of the Soviet revisionists' "aid" to the independent nations of Africa, one can clearly see what kind of goods this "aid" really is.

The Soviet revisionists can provide you with machines, equipment, and loans. But the prices are high, and the interest rates are exorbitant. Outdated products are treated as treasures, and payment is required before the goods are even shipped. The Soviet revisionists can provide you with technology, help with exploration, design, and construction, and send all sorts of "experts." But they demand various special privileges, require generous treatment, and insist on keeping the technology secret. They treat the recipient countries as their benefactors, rather than engaging in equal mutual aid.

All of this shows that the so-called foreign "aid" of the Soviet revisionists is not truly aiding the recipient countries but is instead "aiding" themselves. It is not about promoting the economic development of the recipient countries but about making the recipient countries into economic satellites of the Soviet revisionists. It is not about helping to maintain the independence of the recipient countries but is a means of controlling and binding the recipient countries. In short, the so-called foreign "aid" of the Soviet revisionists is no different from the foreign "aid" of American imperialism. It is merely a new colonialist tool for them to expand, infiltrate, control, and interfere with the countries of Asia and Africa. Their purpose in "aiding" the Arab countries is like this, and their purpose in "aiding" other Asian and African countries is also like this.

The ugly and evil deeds of the Soviet revisionist leadership in "aiding" the independent nations of Asia and Africa are not surprising. They have usurped power in the Soviet Union, restored capitalism, and thus the modern capitalist law of pursuing maximum capitalist profits comes into play. They inevitably oppress and exploit the majority of the Soviet people at home and plunder and enslave the people of other countries abroad. They inevitably betray proletarian internationalism at its roots and implement policies of great-power chauvinism and national egoism.

Now, the Soviet revisionist leadership is still bragging about their "aid" to the nations of Asia and Africa everywhere. However, as Lenin said: "In the marketplace, one often sees a situation where the person who shouts the loudest and swears the most is precisely the one who wants to sell the worst goods." The Soviet revisionist clique is playing such a hypocritical role today. The people of Asia and Africa have already begun to recognize the new colonialist face of the Soviet revisionist leadership from countless facts and their own personal experiences. One day, they will rise up and grab the black hands that the Soviet revisionists have stretched into their countries, throwing out this speculator along with his fake goods.

### 假援助之名　行掠夺之实

    假援助之名　行掠夺之实
    苏修领导集团的头头们，总是对亚非民族独立国家摆出一副“救世主”的面孔。他们张口“援助”，闭口“援助”，喊个不停。他们拚命吹嘘说，亚非民族独立国家只要依靠他们的“援助”，就能使“经济发展开创一个崭新的纪元”，甚至走上“通向社会主义的社会发展的康庄大道”；否则，离开了苏修的“援助”，就简直活不下去了。
    但是，从苏修对非洲独立国家“援助”的真相中，人们可以清楚地看出，这种“援助”究竟是个什么货色。
    苏修可以给你机器、装备、贷款。可是，价钱要大，利息要高。过时产品，当作宝贝，还没发货，先得收钱。苏修可以给你技术，帮你勘探、设计、施工，派去形形色色的“专家”。可是需要各种各样的特权，待遇要优厚，技术要保密。他们对受“援”国摆出一副恩主的姿态，而不是平等的相互援助。
    这一切说明，苏修的所谓对外“援助”，根本不是援助受“援”国家，而是“援助”他们自己；不是促进受
  “援”国家的经济发展，而是使受“援”国家成为苏修经济上的附庸；不是有助于维护受“援”国家的民族独立，而是一种控制和束缚受“援”国家的手段。总而言之，苏修的所谓对外“援助”，完全同美帝国主义的对外“援助”一样，不过是他们对亚非国家进行扩张渗透、控制、干涉的新殖民主义工具而已。他们“援助”阿拉伯国家的目的是如此，他们“援助”其他亚非国家的目的也是如此。
    苏修领导集团“援助”亚非独立国家的这种丑态恶行，是毫不奇怪的。他们在苏联篡夺了政权，复辟了资本主义，那末追求最大限度的资本主义利润的现代资本主义规律就要起作用。他们在国内必然是压迫和剥削大多数苏联人民，对外则必然是掠夺和奴役其他国家的人民。他们必然要从根本上背叛无产阶级国际主义，实行大国沙文主义和民族利己主义的政策。
    现在，苏修领导集团还在到处招摇撞骗，吹嘘他们对亚非国家的“援助”。但是，正如列宁所说的：“在市场上常常可以看到一种情况：那个叫喊得最凶的和发誓发得最厉害的人，正是希望把最坏的货物推销出去的人。”苏修集团今天扮演的正是这样一种伪善的角色。亚非国家的人民已经从无数的事实中，从自己的切身体会中，开始认识到了苏修领导集团的新殖民主义面目。他们总有一天会起来抓住苏修伸进他们国家内的黑手，把这个投机商人连同他所贩卖的假货扔出去。
