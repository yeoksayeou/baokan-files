The Chinese Embassy in Burma Exposes the Burmese Reactionaries' Efforts to Manufacture Public Opinion for a Larger Scale Anti-China Campaign

The Ne Win Government is a Puppet of the American Imperialists and Soviet Revisionists

New China News Agency, July 16th: Rangoon News: On the 14th, the Chinese Embassy in Burma sent a note to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, exposing that the Burmese reactionary government is frantically inciting and manufacturing anti-China and anti-Chinese public opinion, paving the way for a larger scale anti-China and anti-Chinese campaign.

The note said that in recent times, the Burmese reactionary government not only has no intention of repenting or apologizing for the heinous crimes of massacring, arresting, and robbing our numerous patriotic overseas Chinese, attacking the Chinese Embassy and other missions in Burma, and killing Chinese experts assisting Burma, but instead has escalated these actions, pushing the anti-China and anti-Chinese wave they initiated across the entire country of Burma. You are organizing anti-China parades everywhere, shouting anti-China slogans, and brutally persecuting numerous patriotic overseas Chinese in cities and towns across Burma. At the same time, you are mobilizing all propaganda machines to engage in hysterical anti-China propaganda, attempting to cover the truth from the world. Clearly, you are the executioners and demons who kill and harm people, but you portray yourselves as the "Goddess of Peace" and "philanthropists"; clearly, it is you who organize and condone the criminals' atrocities, committing heinous fascist crimes, but you shamelessly and groundlessly shout about "defending sovereignty and independence," as if someone is truly invading your sovereignty and destroying your independence.

The note pointed out that the ones destroying Burma's sovereignty and independence are the Burmese reactionary government itself. You openly join the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists in their anti-China and anti-Chinese campaigns, which shows that you have already surrendered to the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists, willingly becoming their anti-China lackeys and parrots. The Burmese reactionary government is the most unquestionable traitorous clique in Burma. It is you who are frantically engaging in anti-communist and anti-people activities in Burma, waging civil war, massacring the people, and harming the people. You are the true enemies of the Burmese people. It is you who implement pseudo-socialism in Burma, economically exploiting workers and peasants ruthlessly, turning Burma's economy into a mess, causing nationwide food shortages in a country once famous for its rice production. You are the greatest destroyers of Burma's economy.

The note pointed out that the Burmese reactionary government, now at its wits' end, has resorted to desperate measures, stirring up anti-China and anti-Chinese waves, inciting nationalist sentiments, and diverting the Burmese people's attention from domestic difficulties. This is a futile dream; your vile plots will never succeed.

The note said that one of the main pretexts for the Burmese reactionary government's anti-China propaganda is to slander the Beijing Radio and Xinhua News Agency's exposure of the fascist atrocities committed by the Burmese reactionary government as "distorting facts" and "fabricating." The note refuted the Burmese reactionary government's shameless lies with facts, pointing out that the Burmese reactionary government is the chief culprit of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities.

The note pointed out that the Burmese reactionary government slanders Beijing Radio and Xinhua News Agency for "distorting facts," but cannot provide any factual basis. If Beijing Radio's broadcasts are truly the "lies" you slander them to be, then why don't you dare to publish Beijing Radio and Xinhua News Agency's reports in your newspapers? Why don't you dare to publish the Chinese government's and Chinese Embassy's notes and statements of protest? Why do you obstruct the people from listening to Beijing Radio's broadcasts? This shows that you are guilty.

The note finally said, "The truth cannot be hidden by paper, and the sun cannot be obscured by clouds. Your various tricks and deceits will never cover up the truth. Let me tell you honestly: our exposure of your heinous fascist crimes is just the beginning. Since you have fired the first shot of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, we have the right to retaliate. You want to silence us and prevent us from speaking, to tie our hands and prevent us from retaliating, which is absolutely impossible. You have gone too far. If you do not stop now, you will only meet a more tragic end."

    我驻缅使馆揭露缅甸反动派为更大规模反华制造舆论
    奈温政府是美帝苏修反华的应声虫
    新华社十六日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆十四日照会缅甸外交部，揭露缅甸反动政府正在疯狂煽动和制造反华排华舆论，为更大规模地反华排华鸣锣开道。
    照会说，最近以来，缅甸反动政府不但对屠杀、逮捕、抢劫我广大爱国侨胞、袭击中国大使馆和其他驻缅机构、杀害中国援缅专家的滔天罪行，毫无悔罪认错之意，反而变本加厉，把你们一手掀起的反华排华浪潮推向缅甸全国。你们到处组织反华游行，嘶叫反华口号，在全缅大小城镇肆无忌惮地残酷迫害广大爱国华侨。与此同时，你们又开动一切宣传机器，大搞反华的歇斯底里，企图一手遮天，掩盖天下人的耳目。明明你们是杀人的刽子手和害人的魔鬼，但你们却把自己打扮成“和平女神”和“慈善家”；明明是你们组织和纵容暴徒行凶作恶，犯下滔天的法西斯罪行，但你们却恬不知耻，无的放矢地吵嚷要“保卫主权和独立”，好象真有人侵犯了你们的主权，真有人破坏了你们的独立似的。
    照会指出，破坏缅甸的主权和独立的，正是缅甸反动政府自己。你们公然跳出来跟在美帝、苏修的尾巴后面大搞反华排华，这就说明你们已经投入美帝、苏修的怀抱，甘当他们的反华走卒和应声虫，缅甸反动政府就是不折不扣的最大的缅甸的卖国集团。是你们在缅甸疯狂地反共反人民，打内战，屠杀人民，残害人民，你们是地地道道的缅甸人民的敌人。是你们在缅甸实行假社会主义，对工人、农民在经济上实行残酷无情的掠夺，把缅甸的经济弄得一团糟，使一向以产米闻名世界的缅甸全国闹粮荒，你们是缅甸经济的最大破坏者。
    照会指出，缅甸反动政府现在走投无路，竟狗急跳墙，掀起反华排华浪潮，煽动民族情绪，转移缅甸人民对国内困难的视线，这是痴心梦想，你们的卑鄙阴谋永远也不会得逞。
    照会说，缅甸反动政府进行反华宣传的一个主要借口，是诬蔑北京电台和新华社揭发缅甸反动政府犯下的法西斯暴行的报道“歪曲事实”，是“捏造”。照会列举事实驳斥了缅甸反动政府的无耻谰言，指出缅甸反动政府就是反华排华的罪魁祸首。
    照会指出，缅甸反动政府诬蔑北京电台和新华社“歪曲事实”，但是却提不出半点事实根据。如果北京电台广播真象你们所诬蔑的是“满篇谎言”的话，那么，为什么你们不敢把北京电台和新华社的报道在报纸上公开发表？为什么你们不敢把中国政府、中国大使馆的抗议照会和声明公开发表？为什么你们要阻止人民收听北京电台的广播？由此可见，你们是做贼心虚。
    照会最后说，纸包不住火，乌云遮不住太阳，你们的各种阴谋诡计绝不会掩盖住真理。老实告诉你们：我们对你们所犯下的滔天的法西斯罪行的揭露还仅仅是开始。既然你们已经放了反华排华的第一枪，我们就取得了还击的权利。你们想堵住我们的嘴，不让我们讲话，束缚我们的手脚，不让我们还击是绝对办不到的。你们走得已经够远的了，如果再不悬崖勒马，那么只能落得一个更悲惨的结局。
