The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, who are represented in Wuhan, refuse to accept their doom and are struggling desperately in their death throes, launching a frenzied counterattack. Their target is directly aimed at Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group. We guardsmen will not allow this, not in a thousand or ten thousand ways. We warn you, these little hopping clowns: to oppose Mao Zedong Thought is to have no good end, the people will not forgive you, and the iron fist of the dictatorship of the proletariat will give you the punishment you deserve. "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again, until you are wiped out"—this is your logic.

Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun in our hearts. We will forever be the most loyal guardsmen of Chairman Mao. We, the guardsmen by Chairman Mao's side, love Chairman Mao boundlessly, love Vice Chairman Lin boundlessly, love Chairman Mao's headquarters boundlessly, love the Central Cultural Revolution Group boundlessly, and love the revolutionary masses of the proletariat boundlessly. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, whoever opposes Vice Chairman Lin, whoever opposes Chairman Mao's headquarters, whoever opposes the Central Cultural Revolution Group, whoever suppresses the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, is our sworn enemy, and we will fight to the end with them. We vow to be the strong backing of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Wuhan.

Comrade Xie Fuzhi and Comrade Wang Li are loyal executors of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and the most steadfast revolutionaries on the left. We firmly declare: we will take Comrade Xie Fuzhi and Comrade Wang Li as our examples, hold high the great banner of criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, and in the new high tide of criticism against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, unite with, fight with, and achieve victory with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. We will carry forward the spirit of beating a fallen enemy to the ground, and from the political, ideological, and theoretical aspects, criticize, overthrow, and expose the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, making them stink for ten thousand years and never be able to turn over a new leaf.

    毛主席的警卫战士坚决支持你们
    北京卫戍区某部五好战士　刘乃昌
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在武汉的代理人，不甘心他们的灭亡，在绝望中进行垂死挣扎，疯狂反扑，其矛头直接指向毛主席、林副主席、毛主席的无产阶级司令部以及中央文革小组。我们警卫战士一千个不答应，一万个不答应。我们正告你们这一小撮跳梁小丑：与毛泽东思想为敌，绝没有好下场，人民不会饶恕你们，无产阶级专政的铁拳将给你们应有的惩罚。“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡”，这就是你们的逻辑。
    毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳，我们永远做毛主席的最忠实的警卫战士。我们在毛主席身边的警卫战士无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱林副主席，无限热爱毛主席的司令部，无限热爱中央文革，无限热爱无产阶级革命派。谁反对毛主席，谁反对林副主席，谁反对毛主席的司令部，谁反对中央文革，谁镇压无产阶级革命派，谁就是我们不共戴天的死敌，我们就坚决和他拚到底。我们誓作武汉地区无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾。
    谢富治同志和王力同志是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的忠实执行者，是最坚定的革命左派。我们坚决表示：要以谢富治同志、王力同志为榜样，更高地举起毛泽东思想的批判大旗，在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开大批判的新高潮中，和无产阶级革命派团结在一起、战斗在一起、胜利在一起，发扬痛打落水狗的精神，从政治上、思想上、理论上把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批倒、批垮、批臭，叫他们遗臭万年，永世不得翻身。
