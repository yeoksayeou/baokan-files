The black hands of Soviet revisionists, after extending into an African country, have engaged in many unspeakable dirty deeds, arousing the discontent and indignation of the local African people.

The Soviet revisionists have no respect for the dignity of the African nations and arbitrarily interfere in the internal affairs of other countries. In March of this year, during the trade union congress of this country, the Soviet revisionists schemed and bribed some people from behind the scenes, attempting to elect their chosen figures to replace the current union leaders. However, the election results strongly rebuked the Soviet revisionists' evil deeds. The cultural attaché of the Soviet embassy also rushed to the African residential areas, inciting workers to oppose the current union leadership, but met with a shameful failure.

The correspondent of the Soviet "Pravda" newspaper in that country forced the host country's newspaper to publish Soviet revisionist articles and openly went to the radio station to question why the news of the Soviet launch of a spacecraft was not broadcast, causing great resentment among the local media. Due to being unwelcome, this correspondent eventually left the country in disgrace.

Even more audacious was the fact that the wife of the Soviet ambassador personally confronted the representative of this African country attending the emergency conference of Asian and African writers, demanding to know why he went to Beijing for the meeting. This arrogant behavior was met with a strong rebuke.

Soviet personnel in this country often bypassed diplomatic channels and went directly to the public security bureau to handle procedures. The Soviet embassy's mobile cinema went to the countryside to screen films without the host country's government approval, drawing criticism from local public opinion. A newspaper said: "Such things should not be done by foreigners, and no one asked them to do it."

The Soviet revisionists "assisted" this African country in "building" a hotel, with all local expenses paid by selling Soviet goods, which were nothing but junk machines that couldn't be sold. Thus, the hotel, which was supposed to be completed in 1965, has been under construction and is still not finished. Local people complained: "The hotel is built for them. We get no benefit from it."

In 1966, the Soviet revisionists promised to send five doctors to work in this African country, but before the doctors even arrived, they demanded advance payment of three months' salary for each doctor and threatened that if the payment was not made, the doctors would not come.

The Soviet revisionists also dumped goods into this country to compete in the commodity market, aiming to undermine the country's national economy. In the suburbs of the capital, Soviet commodity billboards stood alongside those of Western capitalist countries, attracting business. The commercial counselor's office of the Soviet embassy printed commodity advertisements to lure customers to the Soviet embassy to buy goods. This practice caused great dissatisfaction among local trading companies.

The dam "assisted" by the Soviet revisionists in this country is still in the survey stage, the hotel is still under construction, and the economic loans for these projects have only been in place for over a year, but the Soviet revisionists have already demanded the return of interest and forced repayment. The Soviet revisionists originally agreed to sell an airplane on credit, but before the airplane arrived, the parts were sent, and they shamelessly demanded transportation fees. The Soviet revisionists gave the public security bureau of this country a few motorcycles and cars, and used this opportunity to force the public security bureau to accept "experts," actually attempting to infiltrate and control the country's public security agencies.

It is these very unsavory "assistance" projects that the Soviet revisionists shamelessly boast about. They demand a handover ceremony for every small item given and insist that the government send high-level officials to participate, causing great dissatisfaction among the people. Some people angrily said: "The Soviet Union boasts about giving a needle and thread, a piece of paper." Some said: "The Soviet Union has hurt our national pride." Some officials simply avoided participating in such ceremonies.

As soon as the Soviet revisionist "experts" arrived, they demanded villas, cars, refrigerators, and high salaries. The African masses reflected: "The Soviet 'experts' do not work hard, take high salaries, buy high-grade goods and food, live in luxury, and are fat and prosperous. They are here to exploit us."

The Soviet embassy screened films for African youth, peddling revisionist and pornographic goods, and held photo exhibitions, boasting about "communist construction." Some African youth, after watching, angrily said: "These movies are no different from those in the West. The things the Soviet Union propagandizes are too far from the reality of our country and have no meaning."

African students who studied in the Soviet Union said: During their studies in the Soviet Union, Soviet professors prevented them from reading "Beijing Weekly" and banned listening to Beijing broadcasts. Those who did not obey these unreasonable "orders" were called in for a scolding, and rumors were spread to defame China, aiming to prevent African youth from reading Chinese books. The Soviet authorities even sent spies to follow African students and unreasonably stopped them from continuing their studies in the Soviet Union.

The Soviet "experts" also spread rumors to sow discord between China and African countries. They once told the militia members that the "things" used by the militia were all "assisted" by the Soviet Union. Later, under the rebuttal of the militia members, the Soviet "experts" shamelessly denied it, saying that these were "assisted" by the Soviet Union to China and then transferred from China, attempting to undermine China's prestige in Africa. The Soviet "experts'" deceitful acts have caused great dissatisfaction and have been repeatedly rebuked by the people.

    蛮横干涉内政  进行掠夺剥削  散布修正主义毒素
    苏修黑手伸进非洲国家干尽坏事
    新华社讯　苏联修正主义者的黑手伸入一个非洲国家以后，干了许多不可告人的肮脏勾当，激起了当地非洲人民的不满和愤慨。
    苏联修正主义者毫不尊重非洲民族的尊严，恣意干涉别国的内政。今年三月，这个国家工会举行代表大会期间，苏修在背后出谋划策，拉拢贿赂一些人，企图选上他们物色的人物，以取代现工会的领导人。但事与愿违，选举结果有力地回击了苏修的罪恶行径。苏修使馆的文化专员还跑到非洲居民区，挑动工人反对现工会领导，也遭到了可耻的失败。
    苏联《消息报》驻那里的记者强迫驻在国报纸刊登苏修文章，公然跑到电台质问为什么不广播苏联发射宇宙飞船的消息，引起了当地新闻界的极大愤恨。由于不受欢迎，这个记者最后灰溜溜地离开了这个国家。
    更加放肆的是：苏修大使夫人亲自出马，找这个非洲国家参加亚非作家紧急会议的代表，气势汹汹地质问他为什么要到北京去开会。这种蛮横无理的行径，遭到了有力的驳斥。
    苏修人员来这个国家多次不通过外交途径，而直接去公安局办理手续。苏修使馆电影车不经驻在国政府同意私自到内地放电影，引起当地舆论的谴责。一家报纸说：“这样的事情不应该是外国人干的，而且没有人叫他们去的。”
    苏修“援助”这个非洲国家“兴建”一座旅馆，在当地费用全靠销售苏联商品来支付，而苏联商品却是些销不出去的破烂机器。这样，这个旅馆本来是一九六五年的执行项目，工程进进停停，至今尚未建成。当地人们不满地说：“旅馆是为他们自己盖的。我们得不到一点好处。”
    一九六六年苏修答应派五名医生到这个非洲国家工作，人还未来，就先提出给每个医生预付三个月工资的要求，并且还威胁说，如果付不起，医生就不来。
    苏修还向这个国家倾销商品争夺商品市场，来挤垮这个国家的民族经济。在首都郊区公路旁，苏联的商品广告牌和西方资本主义国家公司的广告牌并在一起，招揽生意。苏修使馆商务参赞处印发商品广告招徕顾客到苏修使馆购买商品。这种作法引起当地贸易公司的极大不满。
    苏修“援”建这个国家的水坝还在勘察阶段，旅馆还在施工中，执行这些项目的经济贷款只有一年多时间，苏修就提出要收回利息，逼人还债。苏修原答应贷款卖一架客机，飞机未到，零件先运去，还厚着脸皮伸手要运费。苏修给了这个国家的公安局几部摩托车和汽车，它借此机会硬要向这个国家的公安局派出“专家”，实际上是企图打进去控制这个国家的公安机关。
    就是这些很不象样子的“援助”，苏修还恬不知耻地大肆宣扬。他们每给一件小东西都要求举行移交仪式，并且强要政府派高级官员参加，引起人们的极大不满。有人愤愤地说：“苏联给一针一线，一张纸都要吹嘘宣扬一阵。”有的说：“苏联挫伤了我们的民族自尊心。”有的官员干脆避开不参加这种仪式。
    苏修“专家”一到这里，就伸手要别墅、汽车、冰箱和高工资。非洲群众反映说：苏联“专家”不好好工作，拿高工资，抢购高级物品和食品，养尊处优，喂得肥头大耳，他们是来剥削我们的。
    苏修使馆给非洲青年放映贩卖修正主义货色和色情的影片，并且举行图片展览，大肆吹嘘什么“共产主义建设”。有的非洲青年看了后气愤地说：“这些电影和西方没有什么区别。苏联宣传的东西离我们国家的现实太远了，没有什么意义。”
    从苏联留学回国的非洲学生说：在苏联学习期间，苏联教授阻止他们看《北京周报》，禁止收听北京广播。有人不服从这些无理的“禁令”，则被叫去训一顿，并且还造谣诽谤中国，以达到阻止非洲青年读中国书的目的。苏修当局甚至派密探跟踪非洲留学生，无理停止他们继续在苏联学习。
    苏修“专家”还造谣挑拨中国和非洲国家的关系。他们曾向民卫队队员宣扬说，民卫队用的“东西”全是苏联“援助”的。后来在民卫队队员的驳斥下，苏修“专家”竟矢口抵赖，胡说什么这是苏联“援助”中国然后从中国转运来的，妄图破坏中国在非洲的威信。苏修“专家”这种造谣惑众的丑行，引起人们极大不满，遭受人们一次又一次的斥责。
