The dignity of the Chinese nation cannot be insulted; we must fight the British Empire to the end. The Hong Kong business community continues to expand its strike.

Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, June 30th: After 59 units in Hong Kong announced a joint strike on the 29th, four more units, including Wa Yang Department Store, Nanyang Office, and wholesale and retail stores for grains and miscellaneous goods, immediately responded and formed a joint force of 63 institutions to launch a powerful counterattack against British imperialist colonial rule.

On the first day of the strike, British imperialism was already in a state of panic and disarray. The "five rows" street vendors in Hong Kong, who operate fresh fruits, vegetables, and meat, along with street vendors in Kowloon, formed a strike force of tens of thousands of people. Despite the threats from the Hong Kong police, they followed the plan and went on strike on the 29th, immediately making the usually bustling streets deserted and desolate. Over 90% of the agents and wholesalers of fruits, vegetables, and meat in Hong Kong and Kowloon also participated in the strike. Among them, over 70% of the fish businessmen joined the strike. Over 90% of the pigpen businessmen joined the strike. Nearly 200 fruit wholesale merchants all participated in the strike. Several dozen egg merchants also all went on strike. The actions of the anti-violence strike force made the Hong Kong government busy and flustered, dispatching vehicles to gather fish and vegetables to decorate the market, but the supply was only one-tenth of the usual amount, and the streets were desolate. The "South-North Row" in the Western District of Hong Kong Island is a distribution area for grains, food, local products, and medicines from the south and north. On the 29th, over 60% of the shops here participated in the strike. The merchants and workers of the "South-North Row" have actively participated in the anti-British and anti-violence struggle since May and have submitted protests to the Hong Kong government four times. On the day of the "May 22nd" massacre, representatives of workers and merchants from these industries participated in the on-site struggle. Today, they expressed that the dignity of the Chinese nation cannot be insulted, and the great cause of the nation cannot be lost. They must fight against British imperialism to the end.

The "Fight Committee" of the department stores, building materials, and publishing and printing industries took action to strike against the Hong Kong government. Over 40 national department stores in Hong Kong and Kowloon, nine branches of the China Leather Shoe Company, and eleven specialized distributors also announced a four-day strike. In the publishing and printing industry, 33 bookstores participated in the large-scale strike.

Many stores showed extreme contempt for the Hong Kong government's so-called "emergency law" during the strike. The employees of the Sanlian Bookstore, who bravely fought against the Hong Kong government in the "May 22nd" massacre, hung a large red banner at the entrance, which read: "In response to the call of the motherland, support the workers' strike, protest against the persecution by the Hong Kong government, the store will be closed for four days!" Some national product companies, although they closed their doors, still kept their windows open, displaying anti-violence slogans and photos of the Hong Kong government's fascist persecution of compatriots. A company in Wan Chai placed a large photo of the Hong Kong government's persecution of compatriots at the entrance and hung a large character banner that read: "The imperialists bully us like this, this needs to be dealt with seriously."

The first day of the joint strike showed the power of this combat action, making the Hong Kong government extremely flustered. They dispatched large numbers of "riot control teams" to various markets and stores for intimidation, and helicopters continuously circled overhead. The director of the Hong Kong government's "Agriculture, Fisheries, and Conservation Department" and the deputy director of the "Commerce Department" personally went out to "stabilize public sentiment," but the patriotic business community in Hong Kong firmly stated that they must persist in the strike and severely punish British imperialism.

　　中华民族尊严不可侮　一定要同英帝斗到底
　　香港工商界大罢市继续扩展
    新华社香港三十日电  香港五十九个单位宣布二十九日举行联合罢市之后，立即又有华洋百货、南洋办庄、粮杂货食品批发零售店等四个单位的反英抗暴组织起来响应，共同组成了一支包括六十三个机构的浩浩荡荡的商业大军举行联合大罢市，向英帝国主义的殖民统治发动强大的反击。
    在第一天的大罢市中，英帝国主义就吓得惊慌失措，狼狈不堪。香港区经营鲜果、蔬菜、肉类等副食品的“五行”小贩，联同九龙区的小贩，组成了几万人的罢市大军，不顾港英警察的恐吓，按照计划在二十九日罢市，立即使得平日摊贩林立的街道，人群疏寂，冷冷落落。港九的果菜、肉类等副食品的代理和批发商，百分之九十以上也参加了罢市。其中鲜鱼业的商人参加罢市的达百分之七十以上。生猪栏商人参加罢市的在百分之九十以上。近二百家水果业批发商全部参加了罢市。数十家蛋业承销商也全部罢市。抗暴罢市大军的行动，使得港英当局手忙脚乱，派出车辆到处拼凑鱼菜运到市场点缀门面，但供应量也只及平常的一成，各街市一片冷落的景象。香港岛西区的“南北行”，是香港粮油、食品、土产山货、南北药材等商品的集散地区。二十九日这天，这里百分之六十以上的商户参加了罢市。“南北行”的商人和职工在五月以来就积极参加了反英抗暴的斗争，曾连续四次到“总督府”向港英当局提出抗议，在“五·二二”血案的当天，这些行业的职工和商人代表一百多人参加了现场的斗争。今天他们表示，中华民族的尊严不可侮，民族大义不可失，一定要同港英帝国主义斗争到底。
    百货、建筑材料、出版印刷等行业的“斗委会”所属的商行，以罢市的行动痛击港英当局。港九四十多家国产百货公司，中国皮鞋公司九家门市部，十一家专业分销商也宣告一连罢市四天。在出版印刷界中，有三十三家书店参加了大罢市。
    许多商店在举行罢市的时候，对港英的所谓“紧急法令”表现了极端的蔑视。在“五·二二”血案中与港英当局进行英勇斗争的三联书店职工，在门口挂了一条大红横额，上面写着：“响应祖国号召，支持工人罢工，抗议港英迫害，本店罢市四天！”有些国货公司虽然把大门关上，但仍然开放橱窗，展出抗暴标语及港英用法西斯手段迫害同胞的照片。湾仔一家公司把一大张港英迫害同胞的照片放在门口，同时挂出一幅大字标语，上面写着：“帝国主义者如此欺负我们，这是需要认真对付的。”
    联合大罢市的第一天，就显示了这一战斗行动的威力，使港英当局狼狈万分。它分别派出大批“防暴队”到各个市场和商店进行恐吓，直升飞机也不断在上空盘旋。港英的“农林渔政处”处长和“工商处”副处长亲自出马“安定人心”，但香港的爱国工商业者坚决表示，一定要坚持罢市，痛惩港英帝国主义。
