Title: Denouncing the Fallacy of "Exploitation Saves People"

Dear Dad and Mom,

When I was at home, Dad often told me that in the old society, our family had no roof over our heads and no land under our feet. We had no way to make a living, so we had to work for the landlords. In the end, we still couldn't eat enough or keep warm. We really couldn't live like that. After liberation, Chairman Mao saved us poor people from the sea of suffering, completely turned things around, and made us masters of society, living a happy life. However, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the party says that "exploitation saves people" and that "the working people do not oppose exploitation but welcome it." This is sheer nonsense, aiming to drag us back to the old days and make us suffer again. We absolutely will not allow it!

Dad and Mom, we must remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "We should follow up our victories with greater efforts and not stop halfway like the ancient hegemon." We must pursue and attack relentlessly, making the Chinese Khrushchev like a rat crossing the street, with nowhere to hide.

    痛斥“剥削是救人”滥调爸爸、妈妈：
    在家时，爸爸常常给我讲，旧社会咱家上无片瓦，下无片土，一家人生活没有着落，只好给地主扛活，到头来还是吃不饱，穿不暖，实在活不下去。解放了，毛主席把咱穷人从苦海里救了出来，彻底翻了身，当上了社会的主人，过上了幸福生活。可是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却胡说什么“剥削是救人”，“劳动人民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削”。这简直是胡说八道，是妄想拉我们走回头路，受二遍苦。我们绝对不答应！
    爸爸、妈妈：我们必须牢记毛主席“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王”的教导，穷追猛打，让中国的赫鲁晓夫象过街老鼠，无处藏身。
