In the northern part of Quang Tri Province in South Vietnam, south of the ancient Citadel and northwest of the Cam Lo River, there is a nameless hill. Recently, ten soldiers of the liberation army, while on a mission there, repelled fifteen attacks by more than two hundred U.S. Marines, killing forty-one enemy soldiers. They made an outstanding contribution to the realization of an important combat plan. For this, the class was awarded the Second-Class Liberation Medal by the Command of the Liberation Armed Forces of South Vietnam. From then on, this nameless hill was called the "Ten Heroes Hill."

One night, ten soldiers were ordered to this nameless hill to prepare the battlefield for a large-scale raid. As soon as the soldiers stopped, the enemy's L-19 reconnaissance planes roared overhead. As soon as they placed the artillery shells they brought, the enemy's cannons started firing. Initially, they did not pay much attention. However, the cannons fired more and more densely, and some shells exploded around the position, which alerted them: the enemy was probably going to send infantry to search.

The ten soldiers had very few weapons, only five submachine guns, two rifles, and a small number of hand grenades. However, the soldiers were filled with hatred for the American aggressors and unanimously declared: no matter what the situation, they would use their weapons to fiercely annihilate the enemy and resolutely achieve victory.

The position of the ten heroes was on a relatively flat small hill, with a small path in front of the position. Around the position were five rectangular trenches that were very advantageous for combat coordination. To facilitate the battle, the soldiers, despite the enemy's artillery bombardment, worked hard to dig and camouflage the trenches with leaves, continuing until deep into the night.

The next morning, the sound of the enemy's cannons suddenly stopped. Then, one by one, the American aggressors appeared in the bushes in front of the position. The soldiers discovered that the enemy was beginning to search the hill and immediately entered the trenches to make all combat preparations. The enemy did not notice the liberation army's position at all and continued to climb up.

Tatata... The liberation army's submachine guns opened fire, and a volley of hate-filled bullets shot towards the enemy. Only to see the American devils screaming in a strange voice, falling one by one. Under the fierce fire of the soldiers, the enemy retreated in disarray. Some of the wounded devils lay on the ground, crying and wailing.

The position fell silent. The soldiers used the lull in the battle to hold a small group meeting in the trenches. Everyone thought that the enemy had not yet figured out the liberation army's position and strength, so they should continue to camouflage and keep the position secret, continuing to fiercely strike the enemy.

Soon, the enemy's planes, cannons, and heavy machine guns began to fiercely attack the hill where the ten brave soldiers were defending. The American devils, unwilling to give up, organized a new attack. They used the bodies of their comrades as cover and crawled up one by one like snails. The liberation army soldiers waited calmly, and when they got close to the position, they opened fire fiercely. Bullets hit the front enemy. The American aggressors, under the pressure of their commander, tried to continue the charge, but were quickly driven back by the liberation army soldiers.

The American soldiers attacked and failed, failed and attacked again, launching a total of fourteen attacks, but they still could not capture the small hill.

After a while, the enemy's heavy machine guns roared again, and they launched their fifteenth attack. This time, the enemy formed a semicircular formation and made their final assault on the hill. Soldier Le Van Tham kept his eyes on the American commander holding a pistol and shot him down in an instant. The enemy lost their command and scattered like ants, many devils dropped their guns and fled in panic. Thus, the enemy's final attack was also repelled.

The ten brave soldiers on the nameless hill, after a whole day of fierce battle, finally defeated the enemy's fifteen attacks and held the position. Soon after, the liberation army's cannons fiercely bombarded a base of the U.S. Marines from here. (Xinhua News Agency, according to the Vietnamese "People's Army Newspaper")

    无名高地上的十勇士
    在越南南方广治省北部古亭山南面，甘露河的西北面，有座无名高地。不久前，十名解放军战士在那里执行任务时，粉碎了美国海军陆战队两百多人的十五次进攻，打死美军四十一名，为实现一个重要的作战计划作出了出色的贡献。这个班因此荣获越南南方解放武装力量指挥部授予的二级解放战功勋章，这个无名高地从此也就被人们称为“十勇士高地”。
    一天晚上，十名战士奉命来到这个无名高地，为一场大规模的袭击战准备战场。战士们刚停住脚，敌人的L—19型侦察机就在头上吼叫。战士们刚把带来的炮弹放好，敌人的大炮就打起来了。起初，他们并不介意。可是大炮越打越密，有的炮弹在阵地周围爆炸，这才引起他们的警惕：大概敌人要出动步兵搜索了。
    十名战士带的武器很少，只有五支冲锋枪、两支步枪和少量的手榴弹。但是战士们满怀对美国侵略者的仇恨，一致表示：不管情况如何，也要用手中的武器狠狠消灭敌人，坚决夺取胜利。
    十勇士的阵地是在一个比较平坦的小山坡上，横在阵地前面的是一条小路。阵地周围是五个长方形的非常有利于战斗配合的工事。为了便于战斗，战士们不顾敌人大炮的轰击，紧张地增挖工事，他们边挖边用树叶伪装，一直干到深夜。
    第二天清晨，敌人的大炮声突然停止。接着，一个个美国侵略者在阵地正面的树丛中露出头来。战士们发现敌人开始往高地搜索，立即进入工事做好一切战斗准备。敌人一点儿也没有发觉解放军的阵地，仍然一个劲的往上爬。
    哒哒哒……，解放军战士的冲锋枪打响了，一排排仇恨的子弹射向敌人。只见美国鬼子发出一片怪叫声，纷纷中弹倒下。在战士们猛烈炮火的射击下，敌人狼狈溃退。一些被打伤的鬼子趴在地上呼叫嚎哭。
    阵地上开始沉寂下来。战士们利用战斗的空隙在工事里开小组会。大家认为，敌人还没有摸到解放军的阵地和力量的底细，仍然要搞好伪装，保守阵地秘密，继续狠狠打击敌人。
    一会儿，敌人的飞机、大炮和重机枪，又开始向十名勇士坚守的山头猛烈袭击。美国鬼子不死心，组织了一次新的进攻。他们用同伙的尸体作掩护，一个跟着一个象蜗牛似地爬上来。解放军战士们沉着地等待，当他们爬近阵地时，猛烈开火。子弹打中了前面的敌人。后面的美国侵略军在指挥官的逼迫下想继续冲上来，但很快就被解放军战士打了回去。
    美国少爷兵进攻了失败，失败了又进攻，先后进攻了十四次，但始终无法攻下这个小山头。
    过了片刻，敌人的重机枪又呼啸起来，他们发动了第十五次进攻。这次敌人组成半圆形的队伍向山头进行最后一次反扑。战士梁文寻一直盯着握手枪的美国指挥官，一下子就把他打翻在地。敌人失去了指挥，好象蚂蚁似地乱成一团，很多鬼子丢了枪慌忙往回跑。这样，敌人的最后一次进攻也被击退了。
    无名高地的十名勇士，经过一整天的激烈战斗，终于胜利粉碎了敌人的十五次进攻，守住了阵地。过了不久，解放军的大炮，从这里猛烈轰击美国海军陆战队的一个基地。　（新华社据越南《人民军队报》）
