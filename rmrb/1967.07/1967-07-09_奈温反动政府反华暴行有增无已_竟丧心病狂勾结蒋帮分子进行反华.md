The reactionary Ne Win government's anti-China atrocities are escalating. They have shamelessly colluded with the Kuomintang remnants, despised by the Chinese people, to carry out anti-China activities.

Rangoon, July 8 (New China News Agency) — According to reports from Rangoon, the anti-China violence orchestrated by the Ne Win reactionary government has spread to more than 30 towns by July 7.

The Ne Win reactionary government, in its madness, has colluded with the remnants of the Kuomintang, despised by the Chinese people, to carry out anti-China activities. According to reports from Rangoon newspapers, on July 6, more than 200 Kuomintang remnants and Burmese thugs jointly held an anti-China "demonstration" in Sittwe.

The anti-China violence organized by the Ne Win reactionary government has mostly occurred in areas where Chinese residents are concentrated. After arriving in these areas, the thugs have been rampaging and causing destruction. They have been shouting the same anti-China slogans, obviously issued by the Ne Win reactionary government. The Burmese government has also ordered schools in various places to suspend classes and forced students to participate in the anti-China violence. In some places, military police and members of the "Socialist Programme Party" have even been mobilized to force people to participate in their organized anti-China "demonstrations."

The thugs organized by the Ne Win reactionary government have also shamelessly attacked the leaders of the Burmese Communist Party and the Burmese people's revolutionary armed forces during the riots. They have posted slogans defaming Burmese Communist Party leaders U Thakin Than Tun and U Thakin Ba Tin, and shouted for the disbandment of the National Democratic Front led by the Burmese Communist Party. They have also strongly attacked broadcasts from Beijing Radio and threatened the Burmese people not to listen to Beijing Radio broadcasts. This shows that the exposure by China and the people of the world of the Ne Win reactionary government's crimes of anti-China, anti-communism, and anti-people has caused the Burmese reactionaries to panic.

In recent days, Burmese reactionary newspapers, following the instructions of the Ne Win reactionary government, have been publishing numerous anti-China articles, frantically inciting anti-China sentiments.

　　奈温反动政府反华暴行有增无已
    竟丧心病狂勾结蒋帮分子进行反华
    新华社八日讯　仰光消息：奈温反动政府一手策划的反华暴行，七日已经发展到三十多个城镇。
    奈温反动政府丧心病狂，竟然勾结被中国人民唾弃的蒋帮分子进行反华。据仰光报纸报道，六日在沙廉有二百多个蒋介石分子和缅甸暴徒一起举行反华“示威”。
    奈温反动政府组织的这些反华暴行，多是发生在缅甸各地华侨聚居的地方。暴徒们来到华侨聚居地区之后，疯狂地进行骚扰和破坏。他们狂叫着千篇一律的、显然是由奈温反动政府统一发布的反华口号。缅甸政府还勒令各地的学校停课，强迫学生们参加反华暴行。一些地方甚至出动了军警和“社会主义纲领党”党徒强迫人民去参加他们组织的反华“示威”。
    奈温反动政府组织的暴徒，在暴乱活动中，还无耻地攻击缅甸共产党领导人和缅甸人民革命武装，张贴污辱缅甸共产党领导人德钦丹东同志和德钦巴登顶同志的标语，叫喊要取缔缅共领导的民族民主团结阵线。他们还极力攻击北京电台的广播，并威胁缅甸人民不得收听北京电台的广播。这表明，中国和世界人民对奈温反动政府反华、反共、反人民的罪行的揭露，使缅甸反动派极为恐慌。
    连日来，缅甸的反动报纸还遵照奈温反动政府的意旨，连篇累牍地大登特登反华文章，疯狂地煽动反华情绪。
