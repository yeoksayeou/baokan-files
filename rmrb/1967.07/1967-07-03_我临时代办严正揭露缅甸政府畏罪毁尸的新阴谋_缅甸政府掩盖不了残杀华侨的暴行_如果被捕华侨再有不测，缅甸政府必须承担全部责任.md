	Chinese Chargé d'Affaires Exposes Myanmar Government's New Plot to Destroy Evidence
	Myanmar Government Cannot Conceal Its Atrocities Against Chinese Residents
	If Detained Chinese Residents Meet Further Misfortune, Myanmar Government Must Bear Full Responsibility

	Xinhua News Agency, July 2nd: Yangon News: On the afternoon of July 1st, Chinese Chargé d'Affaires to Myanmar, Xiao Ming, visited the Myanmar Ministry of Foreign Affairs and met with the Director of the First Political Bureau, U Laung. He once again sternly pointed out that the Myanmar government's incitement of mobs to harm Chinese residents was a premeditated plot and exposed the Myanmar government's new plot to destroy evidence out of fear of being caught.

	After the reactionary Myanmar government orchestrated a large-scale bloody massacre and arrest of Chinese residents, the Chinese government and the Chinese Embassy in Myanmar repeatedly demanded that the Myanmar government immediately provide a list of Chinese residents who were killed, injured, or arrested, along with detailed information about them. This is entirely reasonable, and the Myanmar government has an unavoidable responsibility.

	However, the Myanmar government not only refused to respond to the Chinese government's legitimate demands but is also playing a new trick to cover up its heinous crimes against Chinese residents. On the morning of July 1st, the Myanmar Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the Chinese Embassy to inspect the bodies of Chinese residents killed by Myanmar mobs during their rampage on June 27th against the Yangon Chinese Teachers' Federation. They arrogantly stipulated that the Chinese Embassy must complete the inspection by 4 PM on July 2nd; otherwise, they would dispose of the bodies themselves. The Chinese Embassy immediately pointed out that the Myanmar government must first submit the list of the deceased Chinese residents and notify their families to be present for the inspection. The Chinese Embassy also provided the names of three Chinese residents who had been confirmed killed, demanding that the Myanmar Ministry of Foreign Affairs notify the families of the deceased to inspect the bodies with the Chinese Embassy.

	Chinese Chargé d'Affaires to Myanmar, Xiao Ming, arranged a meeting with the Executive Secretary of the Myanmar Ministry of Foreign Affairs, U Ong Chin. U Ong Chin avoided the meeting, and Director of the First Political Bureau, U Laung, received Xiao Ming instead.

	Xiao Ming sternly pointed out to U Laung that the Myanmar government's incitement of mobs to kill Chinese residents was premeditated. Now, their refusal to provide the list of the deceased and failure to notify the families of the deceased is unreasonable. How can the families identify the bodies if they are not present? The Chinese Embassy has provided the names of three deceased Chinese residents. The Myanmar Ministry of Foreign Affairs' refusal to notify the families of the deceased proves that the Myanmar government intentionally does not want to resolve this issue. This exposes the Myanmar government's new plot to destroy evidence out of fear of being caught. Xiao Ming reiterated that without the inspection of the Chinese Embassy and the families of the deceased, the Myanmar government has no right to dispose of the bodies of the deceased Chinese residents. If the Myanmar government insists on doing so, it must bear full responsibility for the consequences.

	Xiao Ming also discussed the illegal arrest and detention of over 600 Chinese students, teachers, and parents by the Myanmar government on June 30th with the Executive Secretary of the Myanmar Ministry of Foreign Affairs, U Ong Chin. Xiao Ming sternly pointed out to U Ong Chin that the Chinese government and people are deeply concerned about the safety of the Chinese students, teachers, and parents illegally arrested by the Myanmar government. He demanded that U Ong Chin immediately accompany him to visit these Chinese residents.

	Xiao Ming also sternly warned: If any of these illegally arrested and detained Chinese residents die of hunger or are harmed, the Myanmar government must bear full responsibility.

　　我临时代办严正揭露缅甸政府畏罪毁尸的新阴谋
　　缅甸政府掩盖不了残杀华侨的暴行
　　如果被捕华侨再有不测，缅甸政府必须承担全部责任
    新华社二日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆临时代办肖明一日下午前往缅甸外交部会见第一政治司司长吴拉昂时，再次严正指出缅甸政府唆使暴徒残害华侨完全是有计划的预谋，并且揭露了缅甸政府正在玩弄的畏罪毁尸的新阴谋。
    在缅甸反动政府一手制造了大规模血腥屠杀和逮捕华侨的法西斯暴行以后，中国政府和中国驻缅甸大使馆一再严正要求缅甸政府立即提供被杀害、被打伤、被捕的华侨的名单和有关他们的详细情况，这完全是合情合理的，缅甸政府对此负有不可逃避的责任。
    但是，缅甸政府不仅拒不答复中国政府的正当要求，并且正在玩弄新阴谋，来掩盖它残杀华侨的滔天罪行。缅甸外交部在一日上午通知中国大使馆去察验被缅甸暴徒在六月二十七日疯狂袭击仰光华侨教师联合委员会时杀害的侨胞的尸体，并且蛮横地限定中国大使馆必须在二日下午四时以前去察验，否则将自行处理。中国大使馆当时严正指出，缅甸政府必须首先提交被害侨胞的名单，并且通知被害者的家属到场察验。中国大使馆并且提出了现在已经查明被害的三个侨胞的姓名，要求缅甸外交部通知被害者的家属同中国大使馆一道去察验被害者的遗体。
    中国驻缅甸大使馆临时代办肖明为此约见缅甸外交部执行秘书吴翁钦，吴翁钦畏罪避而不出，由第一政治司司长吴拉昂接见。
    肖明在会见吴拉昂时向他严正指出，缅甸政府唆使暴徒残杀华侨完全是预谋的，现在拒不提供被害者名单，又不通知被害者的家属是毫无道理的。试问，被害者的家属不到场怎能认尸？中国大使馆已经提出了三个被害华侨的姓名，缅甸外交部拒绝通知被害者的家属，证明缅甸政府蓄意不想解决这一问题。这就暴露了缅甸政府正在玩弄畏罪毁尸的新阴谋。肖明重申，不经中国大使馆和被害者的家属察验，缅甸政府无权处理被害侨胞的遗体，如果缅甸政府一意孤行，必须对由此产生的后果承担全部责任。
    肖明还就缅甸政府非法逮捕和关押六百多名华侨学生、教师和家长一事，在六月三十日约见了缅甸外交部执行秘书吴翁钦。肖明向吴翁钦严正指出，中国政府和中国人民对被缅甸政府非法逮捕的华侨学生、教师和家长的安全十分关切。他要求吴翁钦立即陪同他去探望这些华侨。
    肖明并且严正警告：这些被非法逮捕和关押的华侨如果有人饿死或被害死，缅甸政府必须承担全部责任。
