To promote revolutionary great unity, the revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing's Xiangyang Middle School, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army comrades, held a major debate.

At the beginning of the debate, there were significant differences in opinions. Some believed that their organization was the most revolutionary, and uniting with other organizations would result in "watered-down porridge" or "compromising." Others thought that their organization was the largest and should be the leading force, with others aligning with them. In response to this situation, the PLA comrades organized the revolutionary teachers and students to study the "Three Articles" and Chairman Mao's relevant instructions, and convened a meeting of representatives from various combat organizations. Everyone agreed that to achieve revolutionary great unity, they must wage a battle against the "selfish" thoughts in their minds. Various organizations decided to open up and criticize themselves, using self-criticism and criticism to expose their thoughts and thoroughly combat selfishness. Someone reflected, "We only criticize others and not ourselves; we only like to hear praise and not criticism, which fosters arrogance and a sense of superiority, making us think we are great after doing a little work." Others said, "One of the main reasons for the failure to unite is the influence of selfishness. We must completely overthrow selfishness to achieve unity." Through self-criticism and debate, everyone realized that the failure to achieve revolutionary great unity was due to the "three more, three less" (believing in oneself more than others; seeing more faults in other revolutionary organizations and fewer in one's own; emphasizing special circumstances of one's own unit more and considering party policies and strategies less). They fought while criticizing themselves, revolutionizing their souls, and paved the way for the entire school to achieve great unity with the revolutionary masses as the core.

After rectification, consolidation, and development, the Red Guards of Xiangyang Middle School have grown from the original 279 to 367, accounting for 80.3% of the total student population. With the help of the PLA, each class established a Mao Zedong Thought Red Guard Combat Team, and the entire school formed the Mao Zedong Thought Red Guard Combat Brigade. Thus, they achieved revolutionary great unity with the revolutionary masses as the core and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," realizing the resumption of classes and the continuation of the revolution.

    为革命大联合开路
    为了促进革命的大联合，北京市向阳中学革命师生，在解放军同志引导下，开展了一场大辩论。
    开始辩论的时候，意见分歧比较大。有的人认为自己的组织最革命，跟别的组织联合就成了“汤泡饭”、“和稀泥”；有的认为自己的组织大，应该以“我”为主，向“我”靠拢。针对这种情况，解放军同志组织革命师生学习“老三篇”和毛主席的有关指示，并召开了各战斗组织代表会议。大家认为要实现革命的大联合，一定要向头脑里的“私”字开战。各组织决定开门整风，用批评和自我批评的方法，亮活思想，狠斗“私”心。有人检查说：“我们只革别人的命，不革自己的命；只喜欢听表扬话，不喜欢听批评话，滋长了骄气，目中无人，出了一点力就觉得了不起。”有的说：“联合不起来的重要原因之一，就是‘私’字在作怪。必须彻底打倒‘私’字，才能实现联合。”通过整风和辩论，大家认识到革命大联合搞不起来，是自己的三多三少（相信自己多，相信别人少；看别的革命组织缺点错误多，看自己组织缺点错误少；强调本单位的特殊情况多，考虑党的政策和策略少）的思想在作怪。他们边战斗、边整风，在灵魂深处闹革命，为全校实现以革命派为核心的大联合开辟了道路。
    经过整顿、巩固和发展，向阳中学红卫兵已由原来的二百七十九名发展到三百六十七名，占学生总数的百分之八十点三。在解放军帮助下，各班分别建立了毛泽东思想红卫兵战斗队，全校统一组成了毛泽东思想红卫兵战斗团。这样，就实现了以革命派为核心的革命大联合和革命的“三结合”，实现了复课闹革命。
