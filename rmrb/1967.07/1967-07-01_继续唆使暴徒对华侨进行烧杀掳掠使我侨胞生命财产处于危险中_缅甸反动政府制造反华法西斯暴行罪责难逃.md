After the reactionary government of Burma declared martial law in the Chinese residential areas of Rangoon, large mobs continued to attack Chinese residents in Rangoon. They are still carrying out looting, arson, and killings, putting the lives and property of Chinese residents in grave danger.

The official newspaper of the Burmese government, the *New Light of Myanmar*, admitted that on the 29th, many mobs in Rangoon and its suburbs continued to run amok. The *Guardian* reported on the 30th that a group of about forty mobsters looted a Chinese-owned factory in North Okkalapa, a suburb of Rangoon, in the afternoon of the 29th, and burned two trucks belonging to the factory. The *New Light of Myanmar* also reported that in Yangon alone, the property looted by mobsters on the 29th was estimated to be worth ten million kyats.

The Burmese newspapers also revealed some of the incidents of mob violence against Chinese residents on the 28th, instigated by the reactionary government of Burma. The *New Light of Myanmar* admitted on the 29th that on the 28th, thousands of mobsters conducted house-to-house searches of Chinese residents, set fire to their homes, looted their property, and ransacked their shops.

The report said that at around 7:30 PM that night, about two hundred mobsters entered the northern part of Okkalapa (a suburb of Rangoon) and threw the property of five Chinese-owned shops into the fire. Then, they continued to enter Chinese residences and carried out their property to burn. It said that four Chinese residents were injured, one of whom was a woman who died.

The newspaper also reported that a group of mobsters burned down the property of a Chinese resident in the Mayangone district of Rangoon in the morning of the 28th. Earlier, the mobsters had set fire to the property of two Chinese-owned hotels in the area, two Chinese-owned poultry farms, six noodle shops, and thirty-four houses in another area.

The *Guardian* reported on the 29th that five hundred mobsters attacked a Chinese-owned restaurant in Rangoon on the 28th. Groups of mobsters also ransacked the remaining property in some residences and shops that had been destroyed the previous day. In the evening, groups of mobsters ransacked the property of Chinese residents in the Bahann and Chaukhtatgyi districts.

　　缅甸反动政府制造反华法西斯暴行罪责难逃
    新华社仰光三十日电  在缅甸反动政府宣布对仰光华侨聚居地区实行军事管制以后，大批暴徒继续对仰光的华侨发动袭击。他们一直在对华侨进行掳掠烧杀，使华侨的生命和财产仍处在极大的危险之中。
    缅甸政府机关报《劳动人民日报》也不得不承认，许多暴徒二十九日在仰光市内和市外继续到处胡作非为。《卫报》三十日报道，大约四十人的一群暴徒，二十九日下午抢劫了仰光郊区北奥卡拉帕的一家华侨经营的工厂，并放火烧毁了这家工厂的两辆汽车。《劳动人民日报》还说，仅在扬金一地，二十九日被暴徒抢走的华侨财产估计价值十万缅元。
    缅甸的报纸还透露了二十八日这天缅甸反动政府唆使暴徒对华侨进行抢劫和烧杀的片断的情况。《劳动人民日报》二十九日承认，数千名暴徒二十八日到处对华侨逐户进行搜查，放火烧他们的房屋，抢劫他们的财产，捣毁他们的商店。
    报道说，这天晚上七时三十分左右有大约两百名暴徒进入奥拉卡（仰光郊区）北部，把第二区的五家华侨商店的财物扔进火中。然后，他们继续进入华侨住宅，把他们的财产搬出来烧掉。它说，有四名华侨被打伤，其中有一个妇女死亡。
    报纸还报道，一群暴徒二十八日上午放火烧掉了仰光马扬翁区的一家华侨的财产。暴徒们在早些时候曾经把这个地区的两家华侨旅馆的财产和另一个地区的两个华侨经营的家禽饲养场、六家面条店和三十四所房屋放火烧掉了。
    《卫报》二十九日报道，五百名暴徒二十八日袭击了仰光的一家华侨饭馆。成股的暴徒还捣毁了前一天被捣毁的一些住宅和店铺里还剩下来的财物。晚上，成股的暴徒还捣毁了巴准东区和乔蒙区的一些华侨财物。另外有几股暴徒前往信号宝塔路、班松丹街和三十七号街，在那里洗劫了一些住宅和店铺，砸烂和烧掉了里面的一切财物。
