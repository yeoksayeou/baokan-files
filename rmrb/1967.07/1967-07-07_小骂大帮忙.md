The Soviet revisionist clique, in order to cover up its counter-revolutionary face of collusion with U.S. imperialism and reactionaries of various countries, always pretends to be something it is not. The result is that it continually exposes its traitorous nature.

The Soviet revisionists' mouthpiece, *Izvestia*, recently published a commentary on the visit of the Japanese reactionary leader Sato to South Korea and his planned trip to South Vietnam. The commentary contained many criticisms, even going so far as to say that Sato was "currying favor with U.S. imperialism's military clique." At first glance, it seems to be speaking in a righteous tone. However, upon closer examination, the entire commentary is nothing but a case of "small criticism, big help."

Sato is a faithful running dog of U.S. imperialism and is of the same ilk as Park Chung-hee and Nguyen Cao Ky. Sato's visit to Seoul and his planned trip to Saigon are nothing out of the ordinary. However, *Izvestia* feigns surprise, claiming that this is a "sudden change in stance" by the Japanese Prime Minister, that it "means abandoning the previous 'neutral' declaration on the Vietnam issue," and that it is a "support for U.S. aggression in the region." This is all nonsense.

Has Sato changed his stance? Regarding the South Korean puppet regime, Sato has long since formed a military alliance with it through the "Japan-South Korea Treaty," and their relationship is very close. Regarding the South Vietnamese puppet regime, Sato has been colluding with it for a long time. The Sato government has consistently supported U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression against Vietnam, providing it with bases for aggression and serving its "peace talks" deception. Where is there any "neutrality" to speak of? *Izvestia* is obviously trying to whitewash Sato.

*Izvestia* even advises Sato to cherish his "prestige and respect," especially warning him that going to South Vietnam would do more harm than good. The Soviet revisionists' concern for this Japanese reactionary leader is truly overflowing.

The Soviet revisionists' meticulous consideration for Sato is, in reality, also for their own benefit. The Soviet revisionists and the Sato government have long since been joined at the hip, with the two families engaging in extensive economic cooperation and "jointly developing" Siberia, getting along like a house on fire. In their eyes, Sato's reputation is not yet too bad. They are deeply afraid that Sato's trip to South Vietnam will fully expose his face as a running dog of U.S. imperialism, which would be detrimental to the continued open collusion between the Soviet Union and Japan. The Soviet revisionists are truly thoughtful. However, in doing so, aren't they exposing their own ambiguous relationship with Sato and his master to the world?

　　小骂大帮忙
    苏修集团为了掩饰它同美帝国主义和各国反动派勾结的反革命面目，老是不断地装腔作势，结果反而不断地暴露自己的叛徒嘴脸。
    苏修的喉舌《消息报》前几天发表评论，对日本反动派头子佐藤最近到南朝鲜和准备去南越“访问”有所议论，言语之间，颇多责难，甚至连“为了讨好美帝国主义者的军事勾结”这样不大顺耳的话也说出来了。乍一听，它唱的蛮象是个正派角色的腔调。但是，再听下去，原来整段唱词完全是个小骂大帮忙。
    佐藤是美帝国主义的一条忠实的走狗，同朴正熙、阮高其之流是一丘之貉。佐藤这次出访汉城，还打算访问西贡，是没有什么值得大惊小怪的。然而，《消息报》却故作惊奇，说什么这是“日本首相突然改变立场”，是“意味着放弃过去在越南问题上‘中立’的声明”，是“对美国在这个地区侵略政策的支持”。真是鬼话连篇。
    佐藤是改变立场吗？对于南朝鲜傀儡集团，佐藤早就以“日韩条约”同它结成了军事同盟，关系亲密得很。对于南越傀儡集团，佐藤同它勾勾搭搭，也非自今日始。佐藤政府一贯积极支持美帝国主义的侵越政策，为它提供侵越基地，给它的“和谈”骗局效劳。哪里有什么“中立”可言？《消息报》显然是要给佐藤涂脂抹粉。
    《消息报》甚至劝告佐藤要爱惜自己的“威信和尊敬”，特别提醒他到南越去利少而弊多。苏修集团对于这个日本反动派头目的关切之情真是溢于言表。
    苏修集团如此无微不至地替佐藤着想，实际上也是为他们自己着想。苏修集团与佐藤政府早已穿上了连裆裤，两家大搞经济合作，“联合开发”西伯利亚，打得火热。在他们看来，佐藤现在的名声还不算太臭。他们深怕佐藤跑了一趟南越，彻底暴露出他的美帝国主义走狗的面目，将会不利于苏日继续进行公开勾结。苏修集团可谓用心良苦。但是，这样一来，岂不正好把他们同佐藤以及他的主子的暧昧关系暴露于光天化日之下了吗？
