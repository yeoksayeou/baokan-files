	The reactionary government of Burma actually incites thugs to insult the great leader of the Chinese people. Our embassy in Burma has lodged the strongest protest.

	Whoever opposes Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, we will fight to the end with them.

	New China News Agency, July 12th: Rangoon News: The Chinese Embassy in Burma sent a note to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 11th, protesting in the strongest terms against the reactionary government of Burma for orchestrating and inciting anti-China demonstrations and allowing thugs to insult the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, in various parts of Burma.

	The note said, the anti-China and anti-Chinese wave instigated by the reactionary government of Burma has spread throughout Burma and is becoming more and more intense. In recent days, the entire country has been filled with hysterical anti-China shouts. The thugs participating in the anti-China demonstrations are shouting the same slogans, absurdly shouting about "defending Burma's sovereignty and independence." This is obviously a farce carefully arranged, planned, and directed by the reactionary government of Burma. This can only show that the reactionary government of Burma wants to be anti-China and anti-Chinese to the end, without turning back.

	The note emphasized that what is particularly serious is that the reactionary government of Burma actually allows thugs in various places to use the most vicious language and the most despicable means to attack and insult the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. This is a serious provocation by the reactionary government of Burma against the 700 million Chinese people, which is absolutely intolerable to the 700 million Chinese people.

	The note stressed that Chairman Mao is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also the great leader of the revolutionary people of the world. All revolutionary people have an unlimited love for Chairman Mao and an unlimited love for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. You dare to maliciously attack and insult Chairman Mao and mobilize all your propaganda machines to fan the flames and cheer. These despicable acts fully prove that you are afraid of the truth, afraid of Mao Zedong Thought. In a word, you are afraid that the Burmese people will grasp the great Mao Zedong Thought, learn the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese Red Guards, rise up to rebel against you, overthrow you, seize your power, dismiss you from office, and trample you underfoot, making you never able to rise again.

	The note said, Mao Zedong Thought is the great truth of our times, and Chairman Mao is the greatest revolutionary of the proletariat in contemporary times. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is being grasped by more and more revolutionary people around the world and has become a powerful ideological weapon for guiding the revolutionary people of various countries to oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries. The reactionary government of Burma now openly jumps out to follow the heels of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists to oppose Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. This is like an ant trying to shake a tree, laughable and self-deluding.

	The note finally said, we must solemnly warn you, Chairman Mao is the reddest red sun in our hearts, Mao Zedong Thought is our lifeline. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, we will fight to the end with them. Those who oppose Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought will have no good end. Whoever dares to oppose Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought will definitely be beaten to a pulp and meet their doom. If the Burmese reactionaries insist on their own way, they will surely reap what they sow.

    缅甸反动政府竟纵容暴徒侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖
    我驻缅使馆提出最最强烈抗议
    谁反对毛主席和毛泽东思想我们就同他拚到底
    新华社十二日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆十一日照会缅甸外交部，就缅甸反动政府在缅甸各地策划、组织反华游行，组织、纵容暴徒侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的严重罪行，再一次向缅甸反动政府提出最最强烈的抗议。
    照会说，缅甸反动政府一手掀起的反华排华浪潮已经扩展到缅甸全国，而且越演越剧，越来越疯狂。连日来，全缅各地是一片歇斯底里的反华叫嚷。参加反华游行的暴徒嘶叫着相同的口号，莫名其妙地叫嚷要“保卫缅甸的主权和独立”。这显然是缅甸反动政府精心安排、策划和导演的丑戏。这只能说明缅甸反动政府要反华排华到底，死不回头。
    照会着重指出，特别严重的是，缅甸反动政府竟纵容各地暴徒公然用最恶毒的语言，用最卑鄙的手段，疯狂攻击和肆意侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席。这是缅甸反动政府对七亿中国人民极其严重的挑衅，这是七亿中国人民绝对不能容忍的。
    照会强调指出，毛主席不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，而且是世界革命人民的伟大领袖。一切革命人民都无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱战无不胜的毛泽东思想。你们竟胆敢恶意攻击和侮辱毛主席，并开动所有宣传机器煽风点火，呐喊助阵。这些卑鄙的行径充分证明你们害怕真理，害怕毛泽东思想。一言以蔽之，你们害怕缅甸人民掌握了伟大的毛泽东思想，学习中国青年红卫兵的无产阶级革命造反精神，起来造你们的反，革你们的命，夺你们的权，罢你们的官，把你们打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，使你们永世不得翻身。
    照会说，毛泽东思想是我们时代的伟大真理，毛主席是当代最伟大的无产阶级革命家。战无不胜的毛泽东思想正在被全世界越来越多的革命人民所掌握，已经成为指导各国革命人民反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的强大思想武器。缅甸反动政府现在公开跳出来，跟着美帝和苏修的屁股后面，反对毛主席和毛泽东思想，这是蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量。
    照会最后说，我们要严正警告你们，毛主席是我们心中最红最红的红太阳，毛泽东思想是我们的命根子，谁反对毛主席和毛泽东思想我们就要同他拚到底。反对毛主席和毛泽东思想的人绝没有好下场。谁敢反对毛主席和毛泽东思想就一定要碰得头破血流，自取灭亡。如果缅甸反动派一意孤行，必将自食其恶果。
