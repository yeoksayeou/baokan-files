The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must take part in the struggle to criticize bourgeois culture at all times." The soldiers and officers of a certain unit in the Beijing Military Region, using Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of "beating fallen dogs," launching a great criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and opening fire on China's Khrushchev!

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The People's Liberation Army must always be a fighting force." The soldiers and officers of a certain unit on the front lines in Fujian are earnestly carrying out the revolution and promoting preparedness, actively conducting military training with the militia, and are ready at any time to make new contributions to safeguarding the security of the motherland and safeguarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "This great school should learn politics, learn military affairs, learn culture, and also engage in agricultural and sideline production, and also run some small and medium-sized factories." The soldiers and officers of a certain unit in the Guangzhou Military Region inherit and carry forward the fine tradition of hard struggle of our Party and our army, reclaiming land from the sea and achieving bumper harvests year after year, and promoting the thought revolutionization of people in the production struggle.

All soldiers and officers in the entire army enthusiastically respond to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao that the People's Liberation Army should be a great school, and in carrying out the glorious tasks of "supporting the left," "military support," and "military control," they take the struggle between the two lines as the key link, and strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, vying to be good students of the great school of Mao Zedong Thought. The picture shows the soldiers and officers of a certain unit in the Shenyang Military Region holding a study and application session of Chairman Mao's works with poor and lower-middle peasants.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "This great school should also engage in mass work." The comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of a certain unit in the Qingdao garrison actively propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies in supporting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution at the Qingdao internal combustion engine factory, helping the entire factory to achieve revolutionary great unity, and initiating a new upsurge in revolution and production.
