	"The Voice of the Thai People" radio station broadcasted an article on the 23rd, enthusiastically celebrating the major victories achieved by the Lao people, led by the Lao Patriotic Front, in their armed struggle against American aggression and for national salvation.

	The article points out that for the past five years, American imperialism has been waging a frenzied invasion of Laos. It staged a coup in Laos, overthrowing the tripartite coalition government and establishing a reactionary regime to serve its aggression; it sent over 5,000 "advisors" into Laos to engage in military activities; it directed the puppet regime in South Vietnam and the Thanom junta in Thailand to send troops to collaborate with the reactionary forces in Laos to attack the liberated areas of Laos.

	The article points out that in the face of the frenzied attacks by American imperialism and its lackeys, the Lao people, under the leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, fearlessly waged a tenacious armed struggle. All patriotic and democratic forces united closely together, repeatedly foiling the enemy's attacks and achieving significant victories. The Lao patriotic armed forces have grown into an invincible force through their battles against the enemy.

	The article emphasizes that the victories achieved by the Lao people over the past five years are the victories of a great people's war, the result of the Lao people, under the correct leadership of the Lao Patriotic Front, persistently and tenaciously waging an armed struggle.

	The article states that the victories of the Lao people have dealt a heavy blow to the American imperialists' plot to expand the war of aggression in Indochina, providing great encouragement to the peoples of various countries, including the Thai people, who are fighting against American aggression.

	The article states that the Thai people are overjoyed by the victories achieved by the Lao people, regarding this victory as their own, and believing that the struggles of the Thai and Lao peoples are mutually supportive. The Thai people fully support the Lao people's struggle against American aggression and strongly condemn the Thanom traitorous clique for colluding with American imperialism, turning Thailand into a base for American aggression against Laos, and sending troops to act as American henchmen to massacre the Lao people.

	The article expresses that the Thai people will resolutely stand shoulder to shoulder with the Lao people, fiercely striking back at the American aggressors and their lackeys and accomplices until the enemy is completely annihilated.

    据新华社二十五日讯  曼谷消息：“泰国人民之声”电台二十三日广播一篇文章，热烈欢呼老挝爱国战线党领导老挝人民，坚持武装斗争，取得抗美救国斗争的重大胜利。
    文章指出，五年来，美帝国主义一直对老挝进行着疯狂的侵略。它在老挝发动政变，推翻三方面的联合政府，建立为它侵略效劳的反动政权；它派遣了五千多名“顾问”进入老挝进行军事活动；它指使南越傀儡政权和泰国他侬集团派兵协同老挝反动军队进攻老挝解放区。
    文章指出，在美帝国主义及其走狗的疯狂进攻面前，老挝人民在老挝爱国战线党的领导下，毫无畏惧地进行了顽强的武装斗争，一切爱国民主力量紧密地团结在一起，一次又一次地粉碎了敌人的进攻，取得了重大的胜利。老挝爱国武装也在同敌人的战斗中壮大成为一支不可战胜的队伍。
    文章强调指出，老挝人民五年来所取得的胜利，是伟大的人民战争的胜利，是老挝爱国战线党正确领导下的老挝人民，坚持不懈地顽强地进行武装斗争的结果。
  文章说，老挝人民的胜利沉重地打击了美帝国主义扩大印度支那侵略战争的阴谋，给正在进行反美斗争的各国人民包括泰国人民以巨大的鼓舞。
    文章说，泰国人民对老挝人民取得的胜利感到欢欣鼓舞，把这个胜利看作是自己的胜利，并认为泰、老两国人民的斗争是互相支持的。泰国人民全力支持老挝人民的抗美救国斗争，强烈反对他侬卖国集团勾结美帝，把泰国变为美帝侵略老挝的基地，并派兵充当美帝帮凶去屠杀老挝人民的滔天罪行。
    文章表示，泰国人民坚决同老挝人民并肩战斗在一起，狠狠地打击美帝侵略者及其走狗、帮凶直至把敌人消灭干净。
