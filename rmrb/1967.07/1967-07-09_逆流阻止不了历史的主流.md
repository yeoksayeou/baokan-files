The countercurrent cannot halt the mainstream of history. U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists are colluding to plot against China, directing their lackeys, especially the reactionaries in some neighboring countries of China, to stir up trouble. For a time, the evil winds blew in all directions. However, their retrograde actions are unpopular and are firmly resisted by the masses everywhere.

In Burma, in many cities, the people held demonstrations in support of China amidst the anti-China wave instigated by the Ne Win reactionary government.

In India, the people of Calcutta smashed the anti-China meeting held by the reactionaries.

In Nepal, the people of Kathmandu beat up the Indian diplomat who openly incited and directed the anti-China activities.

This situation is not only happening in Burma, India, and Nepal. Wherever there is anti-China activity, the people will rise up to defend their friendship with the Chinese people.

Socialist New China is a country personally founded by our great leader Chairman Mao. The Chinese people, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly oppose imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries, and firmly support the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. Today, China is the mainstay of the world revolution.

Imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries hate China to death and slander China crazily. They attempt to use anti-China activities to divert the attention of the masses, resist the influence of China and the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, and thereby maintain their reactionary rule. The more rampant their anti-China activities, the worse their days are. Anti-China is a sign of the weakness of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

The people of all countries want to fight imperialism, want revolution, want liberation. They regard China as their direction and hope. They enthusiastically love China, enthusiastically praise China; they want to follow the path of Mao Zedong, follow the path of China. The anti-China propaganda of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries cannot deceive them, and the rampant white terror of anti-China cannot frighten them. Revolution cannot be suppressed, and the strong desire of the people of all countries to love China cannot be suppressed.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The world will move forward, not backward."

Anti-China is a reactionary countercurrent. This countercurrent can be rampant for a time, but it will eventually be swept away by the revolutionary torrent of the masses. No countercurrent can halt the mainstream of history. The heroes of anti-China will not escape the fate of being swept away in the historical torrent.

### 逆流阻止不了历史的主流

　　逆流阻止不了历史的主流
    美帝国主义和苏修集团串通一气，到处策划反华，指使它们的走狗，特别是在中国一些邻近国家的反动派，兴妖作怪，一时妖风四起。可是，它们的这种倒行逆施是不得人心的，到处受到人民群众的坚决反击。
    在缅甸，许多城市的人民群众在奈温反动政府发动的反华浪潮中，举行了支持中国的示威。
    在印度，加尔各答的人民群众砸了反动派举行的反华集会。
    在尼泊尔，加德满都的人民群众怒打了公然煽动和指挥反华的印度外交官。
    这种情况不只是发生在缅甸、印度和尼泊尔，哪里有反华，哪里的人民群众就会起来维护他们同中国人民的友谊。
    社会主义的新中国是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的国家。中国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，坚决支持世界人民的革命斗争。在今天，中国是世界革命的中流砥柱。
    帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，对中国恨得要死，疯狂地诽谤中国，反对中国。它们妄图用反华来转移人民群众的视线，抵制中国的影响和毛泽东思想的传播，借以维持它们的反动统治。它们反华反得越猖獗，就表明它们的日子越不好过。反华是帝修反虚弱的表现。
    各国人民群众要反帝，要革命，要解放。他们把中国看作是他们的方向和希望。他们热烈地爱戴中国，热情地歌颂中国；他们要走毛泽东的道路，走中国的道路。帝修反的反华宣传迷惑不了他们，猖獗的反华白色恐怖吓不倒他们。革命是压制不住的，各国人民群众热爱中国的强烈愿望也是压制不住的。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席指出：“世界将走向进步，决不是走向反动。”
    反华是一股反动的逆流，这股逆流尽可以猖獗一时，可是它终将为人民群众的革命洪流席卷以去。任何逆流也阻止不了历史的主流，反华的英雄好汉是逃脱不了在这历史洪流中灭顶的命运的。
