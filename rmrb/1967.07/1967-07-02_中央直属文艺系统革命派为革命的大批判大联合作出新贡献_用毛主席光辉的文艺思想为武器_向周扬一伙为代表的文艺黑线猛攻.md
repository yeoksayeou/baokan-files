Central Arts System Revolutionary Comrades Make New Contributions to the Great Criticism and Great Unity for the Revolution

Using Chairman Mao's Brilliant Thoughts on the Arts as a Weapon

Launching a Ferocious Attack on the Black Line in the Arts Represented by Zhou Yang

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on July 1st, over 5,000 proletarian revolutionary comrades in the arts from central arts troupes, art academies, film, publishing, and cultural relic systems gathered at the Beijing Gymnasium on June 28th. They held a meeting to commemorate the third anniversary of Chairman Mao's second directive on literary and artistic issues in 1964 and to struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist Zhou Yang. This meeting was the second major offensive launched by the proletarian revolutionary comrades in the central arts system, who united under the revolutionary banner of criticism, against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. It was also a new, fierce assault on the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in the arts represented by Zhou Yang and his gang.

This meeting was a great success! The vast revolutionary army of the capital's arts community was tempered and tested once again in this struggle, demonstrating the boundless power of revolutionary unity. Half a month ago, revolutionary mass organizations from the central arts system held their first joint meeting to struggle and criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Comrade Chen Boda, a member of the Standing Committee of the Central Committee and the head of the Cultural Revolution Group, attended the meeting and said that this meeting was a "model of great unity among the proletarian revolutionary comrades." He called on revolutionary arts workers to "continue to be models of great unity and great criticism, and to be models of advocating struggle through ideological means rather than through violence." More than half a month of practice has proven that they have not let down the encouragement and expectations of the Cultural Revolution Group. In the great criticism of the revolution, they have continuously consolidated and developed revolutionary unity, making new contributions to the great criticism and great unity of the revolution.

To firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, many revolutionary mass organizations, after the previous meeting, organized their members to seriously study Chairman Mao's works and important editorials from the *Red Flag* magazine and the *People's Daily*. Through study, everyone further realized that the great leader Chairman Mao called on us proletarian revolutionary comrades to unite and launch a great criticism against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. This is an inevitable trend in the development of the movement and an important guarantee for the ultimate victory of the proletarian cultural revolution. Revolutionary arts comrades said well: "Only through great unity can we successfully seize power and hold power; only through great unity can we ultimately criticize and expose a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists; only through great unity can we successfully complete the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our units."

At the meeting, revolutionary arts workers studied Chairman Mao's "Two Directives on Literature and Art" and used them as weapons to confront Zhou Yang in face-to-face struggle, engaging in fierce criticism. They exposed and criticized the crimes of Zhou Yang, the ringleader of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in the arts, who opposed the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. Revolutionary arts workers further realized that Chairman Mao's directives were extremely insightful, striking at the heart of the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists like Zhou Yang, and sharply exposing the essence of Zhou Yang and his gang's implementation of reactionary bourgeois dictatorship in the arts. Therefore, Zhou Yang and his gang feared and hated Chairman Mao's directives to death, and thus intensified their counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics, playing one trick after another, and using every possible means to resist and sabotage this great directive. The revolutionary masses angrily denounced the ringleader of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in the arts, Zhou Yang, who, after Chairman Mao's directives, colluded with Xia Yan, Lin Mo Han, and others in the old Ministry of Culture and the old Federation of Literary and Art Circles to stage a fake rectification movement that deceived the masses, suppressed the leftists, shielded the bad elements, and covered up their own crimes. They attempted to shift the target of the struggle through the tactics of fake criticism and real shielding, and fake self-criticism and real attack. The speaker at the meeting sharply exposed Zhou Yang's blatant defiance of the great leader Chairman Mao's directives, turning the struggle between the bourgeois restoration and proletarian counter-restoration in the arts community, and the heinous crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and opposing the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought into what they called "issues of understanding." They also appointed anti-Party elements, ghosts, and monsters in the arts community to the rectification leadership groups of the Ministry of Culture and the Federation of Literary and Art Circles, attempting to achieve the goal of suppressing the revolutionary leftists.

The speaker at the meeting also exposed how Zhou Yang and his gang desperately opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in the arts, fiercely resisted and sabotaged the arts revolution led by Comrade Jiang Qing, and used books, newspapers, magazines, stages, and screens to produce a large number of poisonous weeds, preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism. Revolutionary arts workers, with indignation, used a large amount of facts to accuse Zhou Yang of his long-standing hatred for Mao Zedong Thought and his use of films, music, dance, drama, and other art forms to fiercely attack our great leader Chairman Mao. All the revolutionary arts comrades present were filled with righteous indignation and shared a common hatred. In the face of iron-clad facts, Zhou Yang, who was once arrogant and rampant, was questioned by the revolutionary masses to the point of being speechless and unable to defend himself.

The arts comrades present expressed that the current proletarian cultural revolution in the arts community has presented a new situation. The preliminary results of the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary comrades in the central arts system have been achieved. We must continuously consolidate this revolutionary great unity and develop this revolutionary great unity.

On June 29th, these arts comrades also struggled against Xiao Wangdong, the promoter of the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in the arts and the ringleader of the suppression of the proletarian cultural revolution in the arts community—the counter-revolutionary revisionist.

　　中央直属文艺系统革命派为革命的大批判大联合作出新贡献
　　用毛主席光辉的文艺思想为武器
　　向周扬一伙为代表的文艺黑线猛攻
    据新华社一日讯　中央直属文艺团体、艺术院校、电影、图博文物系统的五千多名无产阶级革命派文艺战士，满怀对我们伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无限忠诚，抱着对反革命修正主义文艺黑线及其罪魁祸首的刻骨仇恨，六月二十八日齐集北京体育馆，举行纪念毛主席一九六四年六月二十七日关于文学艺术问题第二个批示三周年和斗争反革命修正主义分子周扬大会。这是中央直属文艺系统无产阶级革命派联合起来，高举革命的批判旗帜，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发起的第二次总攻击，是向以周扬一伙为代表的反革命修正主义文艺黑线发起的新的猛烈攻势。
    这个大会开得好！首都文艺界这支浩浩荡荡的革命大军，在这次斗争中再一次经受了锻炼和检验，显示了革命大联合的无穷威力。半个月前，中央直属文艺系统的各革命群众组织，第一次联合起来召开斗争批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大会，中共中央常委、中央文革小组组长陈伯达同志曾到会说，这个大会“是无产阶级革命派大联合的模范”，并号召革命的文艺工作者“继续成为大联合大批判的模范，成为要文斗不要武斗的模范”。半个多月的实践证明，他们没有辜负中央文革小组的勉励与期望。他们在革命的大批判中不断巩固和发展革命的大联合，为革命的大批判和革命的大联合做出了新的贡献。
    为了紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，许多革命群众组织在上次大会以后，组织自己的成员认真学习了毛主席著作和《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》的重要社论。通过学习，大家进一步认识到，伟大领袖毛主席号召我们无产阶级革命派联合起来，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开革命的大批判，这是运动发展的必然趋势，也是无产阶级文化大革命取得最后胜利的一个重要保证。革命的文艺战士说得好：“只有革命的大联合，才能胜利地夺好权，掌好权；只有革命的大联合，才能最后批倒批臭一小撮反革命修正主义分子；只有革命的大联合，才能胜利地完成本单位的斗、批、改。”
    在大会上，广大革命文艺工作者学习了毛主席《关于文学艺术的两个批示》，并以此为武器，对周扬展开了面对面的斗争，短兵相接，狠斗狠批。他们通过摆事实，讲道理，深刻地揭露和批判了反革命修正主义文艺黑线总头目周扬反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪行。广大革命文艺工作者进一步认识到毛主席的批示无比英明，它一针见血地击中了周扬等一小撮反革命修正主义分子的要害，尖锐地揭露了周扬一伙在文艺战线上实行反动的资产阶级专政的实质。因此，周扬一伙对毛主席的批示怕得要死，恨得要命，从而变本加厉地采取反革命两面派手法，阴一套，阳一套，千方百计地对抗和抵制这一伟大的指示。革命群众愤怒声讨反革命修正主义文艺黑线总头目周扬在毛主席的批示以后，还伙同夏衍、林默涵等人在旧文化部和旧文联各协会搞了一个欺骗群众、压制左派、包庇坏人、掩护自己的假整风，阴谋以假批判、真包庇，假检讨、真进攻的手法，转移斗争目标。大会发言人尖锐地揭露了周扬明目张胆地抗拒伟大领袖毛主席的指示，把文艺界资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，说成是什么认识问题；把文艺界的反党干将、牛鬼蛇神安插进文化部和文联各协会整风领导小组，妄图达到镇压革命左派的目的。
    大会发言人还揭露了周扬一伙怎样丧心病狂地对抗毛主席的革命文艺路线，百般抵制破坏江青同志领导的文艺革命，利用书报杂志，舞台银幕，炮制大批毒草，为复辟资本主义作舆论准备。革命的文艺工作者以无比愤慨的心情，用大量的事实，控诉周扬一贯仇恨毛泽东思想，利用电影、音乐、舞蹈、戏剧等文艺形式，疯狂地攻击我们伟大领袖毛主席。全体到会的革命文艺战士，义愤填膺，同仇敌忾。在铁一般的事实面前，周扬这个往日飞扬跋扈、横行一时的“大人物”，被革命群众质问得张口结舌，无法抵赖。
    到会的文艺战士表示：当前，文艺界无产阶级文化大革命出现了新形势，我们中央直属文艺系统无产阶级革命派的革命大联合，已经有了初步的成果，我们一定要不断地巩固这个革命的大联合，发展这个革命的大联合。
    六月二十九日，这批文艺战士又斗争了反革命修正主义文艺黑线的推行者和镇压文艺界无产阶级文化大革命运动的罪魁祸首——反革命修正主义分子萧望东。
