Darjeeling County is a strategically important mountainous region in northern India, covering an area of over 1,100 square miles. It is not far from Bihar and Assam, and is located in a region where India borders several neighboring countries. Nasalbari is only four miles from Nepal, 30 miles from Sikkim, 14 miles from East Pakistan, and 60 miles from China's Tibet. Siliguri is a trade center and a key transportation hub. The only railway connecting India's northeastern Assam region with the rest of the country passes through here.

Darjeeling County is the main tea-producing area of West Bengal, also producing rice and other grains. The primary residents of this region are the Santal tribe and other ethnic groups, most of whom are landless laborers who suffer the most from exploitation and oppression. The land of the plantations was reclaimed by the hardworking Indian people from dense forests teeming with wild animals, risking their lives and laboring for over a hundred years. However, the fruits of their labor have all been seized by the plantation owners.

In Siliguri, there are approximately 60,000 acres of farmland. Of these, only 19,000 acres belong to the Indian government, while the rest are owned by large landowners. With the support of the Congress Party government, these large landowners and plantation owners continuously seize land reclaimed by farmers. They even openly sell government-owned land and seize the rice harvested by impoverished farmers. (According to Xinhua News Agency) (Accompanying picture)

　　大吉岭县
    大吉岭县是印度北部的一个具有重要战略意义的山区，面积有一千一百多平方英里。它离比哈尔邦和阿萨姆邦不远，处于印度同几个邻国接壤的地区中。纳萨尔巴里离尼泊尔只有四英里，离锡金三十英里，离东巴基斯坦十四英里，离中国西藏六十英里。西里古里是一个贸易中心，也是一个交通要地。联接印度东北阿萨姆邦和印度其它地区的唯一的一条铁路从这里通过。
    大吉岭县是西孟加拉邦的主要产茶区，还出产稻米和其它谷物。居住在这个地区的主要是桑塔尔族等部族人，他们大都是受剥削压迫最重的无地雇农。种植园的土地是勤劳的印度人民在野兽出没的稠密的森林中，冒着生命危险，经过上百年的流血流汗的劳动开垦出来的。但是，他们的劳动果实都被种植园主吞没了。
    在西里古里，大约有六万英亩农田，其中除了一万九千英亩属于印度政府外，都属于大地主所有。大地主和种植园主在国大党政府的支持下，不断抢占由农民开垦的土地。他们还公然出售属于政府的土地，甚至抢走贫苦农民种植的稻谷。（据新华社讯）（附图片）
