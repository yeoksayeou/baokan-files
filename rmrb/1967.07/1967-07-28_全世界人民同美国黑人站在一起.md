The armed struggle of American blacks against violence is rapidly developing. Their heroic deeds are of great significance to the struggle of the American people against the reactionary rule of the American monopolies and to the struggle of the people of the world against American imperialism.

American imperialism is the greatest aggressor and oppressor in history. It is the common enemy of the people of the world, including the American people. Like a beast, it roams the world, provoking anti-American storms in various countries. At the same time, American imperialism implements extremely reactionary rule at home, ruthlessly exploiting and oppressing the vast majority of American laborers, especially the more than 20 million black people. This inevitably meets with strong opposition from the people at home. The rise of the armed struggle of blacks against violence is a major outbreak of the American people's opposition to the reactionary rule at home.

As our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The fascist atrocities of American imperialism against blacks have exposed the true nature of American so-called democracy and freedom, revealing the intrinsic link between the domestic reactionary policies of the American government and its aggressive policies abroad."

American imperialism, in order to carry out its aggressive actions abroad, first intensifies its attacks and oppression of the people at home. Especially since American imperialism expanded the war in Vietnam, it has ruthlessly plundered manpower and resources at home, greatly deepening the misery of the American people. The failure of American imperialism's aggression abroad will inevitably intensify class contradictions at home. The flames of armed struggle by American blacks against violence are burning fiercely precisely because American imperialism is at its wit's end in the Vietnam War, and the struggle against American imperialism and its lackeys is flourishing worldwide. This reflects the unprecedented severity of American imperialism's predicament of being besieged both internally and externally, and the further political awakening of the black masses in America.

The fighting American blacks have dealt a heavy blow to American imperialism from within. They have severely punished the fascist military police who brutally suppress the people, completely trampling underfoot the so-called "law and order" of the American reactionary rule, causing more than a dozen cities to fall into paralysis or chaos, and the American ruling class is at a loss for a solution. The burgeoning armed struggle of American blacks against violence is fiercely striking at the domestic rule of American imperialism, which will inevitably weaken its ability to wage aggression abroad and deepen its already insurmountable difficulties. The brave struggle of the American black masses will not only have a great promoting effect on the revolutionary struggle of the American people but also be a powerful support for the anti-American struggle of the people of the world, especially for the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression for national salvation.

American imperialism's policy of aggression abroad has created its own gravediggers in various countries of the world; American imperialism's fascist rule at home has created its own gravediggers at home. American imperialism has fallen into the encirclement of the people of the world. American imperialism will perish under the joint attack of the American people and the people of the world. No matter how much help the Soviet revisionist clique provides, it cannot save American imperialism.

Chairman Mao said: "The just struggles of the people of all countries in the world are mutually supportive." All the people of the world who suffer from American imperialism's aggression, interference, control, and bullying should take immediate action to resolutely support the just struggle of American blacks. The people of the world and the broad masses of the American people should unite to form the broadest anti-American united front, strengthen unity, and persist in the struggle. This will definitely bury American imperialism completely.

    全世界人民同美国黑人站在一起
    本报评论员
    美国黑人武装抗暴斗争正在迅猛发展。他们的这一英勇壮举，对于美国广大人民反对美国垄断集团反动统治的斗争，对于世界各国人民反对美帝国主义的斗争，都有重要的意义。
    美帝国主义是历史上最大的侵略者和压迫者。它是包括美国人民在内的全世界人民的共同敌人。它象野兽一样，在全世界到处乱窜，激起了世界各国人民的反美风暴。同时，美帝国主义在国内实行了极端反动的统治，对广大的美国劳动人民，特别是两千多万黑人群众，进行残酷的剥削和压迫。这就必然遭到国内人民的强烈反对。黑人武装抗暴斗争的兴起，就是美国人民反对美国国内反动统治的大爆发。
    正如我们伟大领袖毛主席所指出的：“美国帝国主义对黑人的法西斯暴行，揭穿了美国的所谓民主和自由的本质，暴露了美国政府在国内的反动政策和在国外的侵略政策之间的内在联系。”
    美帝国主义为了在国外疯狂进行侵略，首先就要加紧进攻和压迫国内人民。特别是美帝国主义扩大侵越战争以来，它在国内穷凶极恶地搜刮人力物力，大大加深了美国广大人民的灾难。而美帝国主义对外侵略的失败，也就一定要加剧国内的阶级矛盾。美国黑人武装抗暴的烈火，正是美帝国主义在侵越战争中走投无路、全世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争蓬勃发展的情况下熊熊燃烧起来的。这反映了美帝国主义内外交困的处境空前严重，反映了美国黑人群众的政治觉悟进一步提高。
    战斗的美国黑人从美国内部给了美帝国主义以极其沉重的打击。他们痛惩血腥镇压人民的法西斯军警，把美国反动统治的所谓“法治和秩序”完全踩在脚下，使十几个城市陷于瘫痪或混乱，美国统治集团穷于应付。方兴未艾的美国黑人武装抗暴斗争，猛烈地冲击美帝国主义的国内统治，这也就必然要削弱它对外侵略的力量，加深它本来就无法解决的困难。美国黑人群众的英勇战斗，不但对美国人民的革命斗争将产生巨大的推动作用，而且对世界各国人民的反美斗争，特别是对越南人民的抗美救国战争，也是有力的支持。
    美帝国主义对外的侵略政策，在世界各国为它自己制造了掘墓人；美帝国主义对本国人民的法西斯统治，在国内为它自己制造了掘墓人。美帝国主义已陷入全世界人民的重重包围之中。美帝国主义必将在美国人民和世界各国人民内外夹攻之下，走向灭亡。不管苏修集团怎样帮忙，也救不了它的命。
    毛主席说：“全世界各国人民的正义斗争，都是互相支持的。”全世界一切遭受美帝国主义侵略、干涉、控制和欺负的人民，都应当紧急行动起来，坚决支持美国黑人的正义斗争。世界各国人民和美国的广大人民联合起来，形成一个最广泛的反美统一战线，加强团结，坚持斗争，就一定能够把美帝国主义彻底埋葬。
