The Soviet Moldavian newspaper "Soviet Moldavia" recently published an article titled "The Market and Market Issues." From this article, it is evident how the Soviet revisionist leadership is going to great lengths to develop free markets and open wide the door for free trade.

The article shamelessly exclaims, "The collective farm markets are becoming more and more active, and the variety of products on sale is increasing. This is a very welcome phenomenon."

The article, with a self-satisfied tone, paints a picture of a capitalist market in full swing.

The article states: "The time has come when collective farm markets often cannot accommodate all the products brought to market for sale. The sales booths, stalls, and counters are not enough. On some days, as many as fifty thousand people bring their products to market for sale! The technical base for market trade is obviously lagging behind product production, and the number of products that rural laborers can provide to the public is increasing."

The article writes: "According to the new regulations, all funds from retail taxes and equipment rentals should be used for the construction, improvement, and expansion of collective farm markets. In the past two years alone, nearly one million rubles have been spent on these items. The construction of the indoor market in Belytsy is nearing completion, and large sales booths in Yegorlyk and Ataki, as well as other regions and cities, have been built. Refrigeration rooms, vegetable washing pools, and 30,000 square meters of market area have been paved with asphalt."

The article strongly advocates for more "organizational work" to attract "all surplus agricultural products to the market."

The article also promotes the so-called "experience" of the Odessa region, claiming that "our neighbors in the Odessa region have shown us the way to widely involve collective farms in market trade. For example, the collective farm led by the twice Hero of Socialist Labor, Posmitnei, has twelve large sales booths in Odessa alone, selling a wide variety of products. The collective farms in Odessa are building their own sales booths and stores, which will later be reimbursed by the market management. The regional executive committee recently passed a resolution to support the initiative of building fifty-one sales booths in city markets to sell surplus products."

The article demands that preparations be made for farmers going to the free market, including transportation, canteens, barbershops, etc. It states, "Collective farmers carrying bags and baskets cannot always find a convenient car to transport their products to the city. As in the Odessa region, fixing transportation to large markets greatly helps to increase the volume of market sales."

### 为农产品自由买卖大开方便之门

    为农产品自由买卖大开方便之门
    《苏维埃摩尔达维亚报》最近发表了一篇题为《市场及市场问题》的文章。从这篇文章中可以看出苏修领导集团如何千方百计发展自由市场，为自由贸易大开方便之门。
    文章恬不知耻地叫喊，“集体农庄集市越来越活跃，上市出售的各种各样的产品越来越多。这是十分可喜的现象。”
    文章以洋洋自得的笔调描绘出一幅资本主义泛滥的自由市场的图景。
    文章说：“这样的时候已经到来：集体农庄市场往往简直容纳不下所有上市供出售的产品。售货亭、小贩摊、柜台不够用。因为在有些日子里把自己的产品运上市来出售的达五万人！市场贸易的技术基地显然落后于产品生产，而农村劳动者能向公民们提供的产品数量越来越多。”
    这篇文章写道：“根据新条例，所有来自零售税和出租用具的资金都应当用于建设、完善和扩大集体农庄市场。仅近两年内为这些用项开支了近百万卢布。贝里齐的室内商场的建设即将竣工，叶金齐和阿塔基以及其他地区和城市的大型售货亭已经建成，正在建设冷藏室、洗菜池，三万平方米市场用地已铺上沥青。”
    这篇文章大肆鼓吹多做“组织工作”，以便把“所有剩余农产品吸引到市场上来。”
    文章还宣扬敖德萨州的所谓“经验”，说什么“我们的邻居——敖德萨州的经验，给我们提出了广泛吸收集体农庄参加市场贸易的道路。例如，两次获得社会主义劳动英雄称号的波斯米特内伊领导的集体农庄，仅在敖德萨就有十二个大售货亭，出售种类极为繁多的产品。敖德萨的集体农庄正在自己建设售货亭和商店，以后由市场管理处偿还成本。州执委会不久前通过了关于让集体农庄建设五十一个在城市市场出售剩余产品的售货亭的决议，支持这种主动精神。”
    文章要求给上自由市场的农民准备好交通运输工具、食堂、理发店等等，说“背着口袋和提着篮子的集体农民并不是经常能找到顺路汽车把自己的产品运进城的。象敖德萨州一样，把运输工具固定给大的市场，在很大程度上有助于上市量的急剧增长。”
