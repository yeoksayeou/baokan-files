    On the Need to Delay "Fair Play"
    Lu Xun

    Editor's Note: Forty-two years ago, in the article "On the Need to Delay 'Fair Play'," Lu Xun told us that we must definitely beat the fallen dog. He said, "If it is a dog that bites people, I think it is all in the category of dogs that can be beaten, whether it is on the shore or in the water."

    The biggest clique of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road are not only "dogs that bite people," but also a gang of man-eating beasts. Although they have been exposed by the broad masses of revolutionary proletarians and have become "fallen dogs," they are still alive and their hearts are not dead. They are always waiting for an opportunity to counterattack, attempting to rise again and return to power. We proletarian revolutionaries must remember Lu Xun's words, using the spirit of beating fallen dogs, to carry out a thorough criticism and struggle against the biggest clique of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, completely criticizing them down, criticizing them to the ground, and criticizing them to stink, so that they will be infamous for eternity and never be able to rise again!

    Some people think that as long as the power-holders taking the capitalist road are named or dismissed, they are like dead tigers. This view is wrong. All big and small power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road are paper tigers, but not dead tigers. We have not completely criticized them down and criticized them to stink, and they are still live tigers. They will try their best to act harmless and pitiful. But never forget that they are snake-like evil people. At most, they are like frozen snakes. Once they wake up, they will bite people. Therefore, we must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Do not pity snake-like evil people." If we are not vigilant and do not carry out a thorough criticism, they may stage a counter-revolutionary comeback, drown the working people in a sea of blood. If we do not remember the many bloody lessons of history, we must carry out a thorough criticism; otherwise, it is a betrayal of the proletarian revolutionary cause.

    This unprecedented Cultural Revolution is to thoroughly criticize the exploitative class ideology and thoroughly establish proletarian ideology, that is, to thoroughly establish Mao Zedong Thought. Let Mao Zedong Thought occupy every position. The biggest clique of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road is a pile of rotten garbage. Thoroughly clearing away these piles of garbage on the ideological front is very beneficial for us to thoroughly establish Mao Zedong Thought and for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Currently, we should push the revolutionary criticism to a new high tide.

    Carrying out a revolutionary criticism of the biggest clique of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road is an important part of Chairman Mao's great strategic deployment and a major event related to the success or failure of the proletarian Cultural Revolution. Thoroughly criticizing down and criticizing to stink the biggest clique of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road in front of the people of the whole country and the people of the whole world will promote the proletarian Cultural Revolution to advance better and will have a profound impact on the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world.

    I. Explanation of the Title

    In the 57th issue of "Language Threads," Mr. Yu Kang mentioned "Fair Play" (Fairplay), believing that this spirit is the hardest to find in China, and we can only encourage it. He also said that not "beating fallen dogs" can supplement the meaning of "Fair Play." I do not understand English, so I do not know the exact meaning of this word. If not "beating fallen dogs" is also part of this spirit, then I would like to have some discussion on this. But the title does not directly write "beating fallen dogs," it is to avoid being too eye-catching, and it does not necessarily mean to wear a "righteous horn" on the head. In short, it is just to say that "fallen dogs" can be beaten, or even should be beaten.

    II. On the Three Types of Fallen Dogs, Most of Which Are in the Category of Dogs That Can Be Beaten

    Those who discuss this often compare "beating fallen dogs" with "beating dead tigers," thinking that both are somewhat cowardly. I think "beating dead tigers" is pretending to be cowardly and acting brave, which is somewhat humorous, although it cannot avoid being somewhat cowardly, but it is cowardly in a way that makes people lovable. As for "beating fallen dogs," it is not so simple, and it depends on how the dog is and how it fell into the water. Considering the reasons for falling into the water, there are generally three types: (1) the dog itself fell into the water, (2) someone else beat it into the water, (3) I personally beat it into the water. If I encounter the first two types, I immediately join in the beating, which is naturally too trivial, or even somewhat cowardly; but if I fight with the dog and personally beat it into the water, then even if I use a bamboo stick to beat it in the water, it seems not too much, and it should not be discussed in the same category as the first two types.

    It is said that brave boxers do not beat the enemy who has fallen to the ground. This is indeed worthy of being a model for us. But I think we should add one more thing, that is, the enemy must also be a brave fighter. After being defeated, either he is ashamed and repents and does not come again, or he comes back to revenge in a dignified manner, which is also acceptable. But for dogs, we cannot use this as an example and compare it with an equal enemy, because no matter how much it barks, it does not understand "morality." Moreover, dogs can float on water and will definitely climb back to the shore. If you are not careful, it will shake its body and splash water all over your face. Then it will tuck its tail and run away. But its nature remains the same. Honest people take its falling into the water as being baptized, thinking that it must have repented and will not bite people again, which is a big mistake.

    In short, if it is a dog that bites people, I think it is all in the category of dogs that can be beaten, whether it is on the shore or in the water.

    III. On Pekingese Dogs, Which Should Be Beaten Even After Falling into the Water

    Pekingese dogs, also known as Ha-ba dogs, are called Western dogs in the south, but it is said that they are actually a Chinese product. In international dog competitions, they often win gold medals. The dog photos in the "Encyclopedia Britannica" also have several that are our Chinese Pekingese dogs. This is also a national glory. But dogs and cats are not enemies, right? It is a dog, but it also looks like a cat, moderate, fair, reconciliatory, and impartial, with a face that seems to say, "Only I have obtained the 'middle way' while others are all biased." Therefore, it is also favored by rich people, eunuchs, madams, and misses, and its offspring is endless. Its business is only to gain the favor of nobles with its clever fur, or to follow the feet of foreign and domestic ladies when they go out, with a fine chain tied around its neck.

    These should be beaten into the water first and then beaten again; if it falls into the water by itself, it is also not a problem to beat it again, but if it is too good by itself, it is not necessary to beat it, but it is also not necessary to sigh for it. If Pekingese dogs can be tolerated, other dogs can also be tolerated, because although they are very opportunistic, they still have some wildness and are not as wall-hugging as Pekingese dogs.

    The above is a digression, which seems to have no great relationship with the main topic.

    IV. On Not "Beating Fallen Dogs" Being Misleading to the Younger Generation

    In short, whether a fallen dog should be beaten depends first on its attitude after climbing back to the shore.

    The nature of dogs does not change easily. If it is a million years later, it might be different from now, but I am talking about now. If you think that it is very pitiful after falling into the water, then animals that harm people are pitiful, and the most pitiful is the cholera bacterium, which reproduces quickly, but its character is very honest. However, the doctor will never let it go.

    Now, officials and local gentry or foreign gentry, as long as it does not suit their own interests, they say it is "red" and "communist." Before the founding of the Republic, it was somewhat different. First, they said "Kang Party," then "Revolutionary Party," and even went to the officials to inform on them, on the one hand, to protect their own honor, but also to have the intention of "dying red hats with human blood." But the revolution finally came. A group of stinky gentry immediately became frightened like homeless dogs, wrapping their small braids on top of their heads. The revolutionary party also had a new atmosphere, the "civilized" atmosphere that the gentry had deeply hated and detested, saying that "all should participate in the new era." We are not beating fallen dogs, let them climb up. So they climbed up, lying low until the second half of the second year of the Republic, the second revolution, when they suddenly came out to help Yuan Shikai bite many revolutionary people to death. China became darker and darker, day by day, until now, not to mention the old remnants, but even the young remnants are still so many. This is because the pioneers' kindness to the ghosts, the mercy to the ghosts, made them reproduce, and later, the clear-minded youth, in order to resist the darkness, will have to spend more and more energy and life.

    Miss Qiu Jin was killed by informing on her, and after the revolution, she was temporarily called a "female hero," but now it is not often heard that someone mentions her. After the revolution, her hometown had a military governor, which is equivalent to the current so-called military governor, and he was also her comrade: Wang Jinfa. He caught the mastermind who killed her and collected the case files of the informant, wanting to avenge her. However, he finally released the mastermind, saying that it was already the Republic, and everyone should not pursue old grudges. But after the failure of the second revolution, Wang Jinfa was executed by Yuan Shikai's dogs, and the one who had a great influence was the mastermind he released who had killed Qiu Jin.

    This person has also "passed away," but the same kind of people are still rampant there, so Qiu Jin's hometown is still the same old hometown, year after year, without any progress. From this point of view, Miss Yang Yinyu and Mr. Chen Xiyang, who grew up in a city that can be a model for China, are truly blessed.

    V. On Not Mixing Up Fallen Figures with "Fallen Dogs"

    "To be wronged and not to retaliate" is the way of forgiveness, "an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth" is the way of justice. China has the most "crooked way": not beating fallen dogs, but being bitten by dogs. But this is actually the honest people themselves seeking suffering.

    The proverb says: "Honesty is a useless alias," which may be a bit harsh, but when you think about it carefully, it is actually not a speech that incites people to do evil, but a sentence that summarizes many bitter experiences: for example, not beating fallen dogs. Its cause is generally two: one is unable to beat; two is a mistake in proportion. The former is not discussed here; the latter's great mistake is also two: one is to mistakenly equate fallen figures with fallen dogs, two is to not distinguish between good and bad fallen figures, and thus treat them equally, resulting in indulging evil. Just take the present as an example, because of the unstable political situation, it is rising and falling like a wheel, bad people rely on icebergs, doing whatever they want, once they fall into the water, they suddenly beg for mercy, and those who have personally seen or personally suffered their bites, suddenly regard them as "fallen dogs," not only do not beat them, but even have pity for them, thinking that justice has been done, chivalry is here. But they have never really fallen into the water, their lairs are already built, and their food is already stored, and they are all in the concessions. Although they sometimes seem to be injured, they are not really injured, at most they are just pretending to be lame, just to arouse people's pity, so that they can hide in time. When they come back, they still start by biting honest people, "throwing stones into the well," doing whatever they want, and when looking for the cause, part of it is because honest people do not "beat fallen dogs." So, if you say it harshly, it is also digging a pit for yourself and burying yourself, blaming heaven and people, all wrong.

    VI. On Not Being Able to Simply "Fair Play" Now

    Kind-hearted people may ask: Then, do we not want "Fair Play"? I can immediately answer: Of course, we want it, but it is too early. This is the "inviting you into the pot" method. Although kind-hearted people may not be willing to use it, I can still speak reasonably. Landlords or foreign gentry often say that China has its own special national conditions, and the equality and freedom of foreign countries cannot be applied. I think this "Fair Play" is also one of them. Otherwise, they do not "Fair Play" to you, but you go "Fair Play" to them, the result is that you will suffer a loss, not only will you not get "Fair Play," but you will not even get not "Fair Play." So to "Fair Play," it is best to first look at the opponent, if it is not worthy of receiving "Fair Play," you can be straightforward and not polite; wait until it also "Fair Play," and then "Fair Play" with it is not too late.

    This seems to have the suspicion of advocating double morality, but it is also out of necessity, because if not so, China will not have a better way. China now has many double moralities, masters and slaves, men and women, have different moralities, and have not yet been unified. If you treat "fallen dogs" and "fallen people" equally, it is really too biased and too early, just like the gentry's so-called freedom and equality are not bad, but in China, it is a bit too early. So if someone wants to universally implement the "Fair Play" spirit, I think at least it must wait until the so-called "fallen dogs" have some human nature. But now it is also not absolutely impossible, that is, as mentioned above: look at the opponent clearly. And there must be a difference, that is, "Fair Play" must be applied according to the opponent's situation, no matter how it falls into the water, for people it is to help them, for dogs it is to ignore them, for bad dogs it is to beat them. In a word: "Factionalism" is all.

    The famous sayings of the gentlemen who are full of "Boli" and full of "public reason" are temporarily put aside and not discussed, even if the public reason that the sincere people shout is also not enough to save good people in today's China, and even to protect bad people. Because when bad people are in power and oppress good people, even if someone shouts public reason, they will not listen, shouting is just shouting, good people still suffer. But occasionally, good people or slightly rise up, then bad people should have fallen into the water, but then, the sincere public reasoners shout "do not retaliate"! "forgiveness"! "do not resist evil with evil"! ... This time it has real effect, not just shouting: good people think it is right, and bad people are thus saved. But after being saved, they only think they have gained an advantage, and have they ever repented? Moreover, because they have already dug three holes and are good at scheming, they will not take long to be as powerful as before, doing evil as before. At this time, the public reasoners naturally shout again, but this time they do not listen to you.

    But, "hating evil too severely," "acting too urgently," the clean officials of the Han Dynasty and the Donglin Party of the Ming Dynasty were indeed defeated because of this point, and the commentators often blame them for this. But do you know that on the other side, have they not "hated goodness as much as evil"? People do not say a word. If in the future, light and darkness cannot fight thoroughly, honest people mistakenly take indulging evil as tolerance, and continue to indulge, then the current state of chaos will be endless.

    VII. On "Repaying with the Same Coin"

    Chinese people believe in either traditional Chinese medicine or Western medicine. Now in relatively large cities, there are often both kinds of doctors, making them each find their own place. I think this is indeed a very good thing. If it can be extended, complaints will definitely be reduced, or the world may even reach a state of good governance. For example, the national etiquette of the Republic is bowing, but if someone thinks it is not right, then let him kneel. The laws of the Republic have no corporal punishment, but if someone thinks corporal punishment is good, then when this person commits a crime, he should be specially beaten on the buttocks. Bowls and chopsticks, food and dishes, are set for today's people. Those who want to be like the people before Shennong should eat raw meat; build a few thousand thatched houses, and pull out all the high officials who admire Yao and Shun in the big houses to live there; those who oppose material civilization should naturally not be allowed to sit in a car with grievances. If this is done, it is truly "seeking benevolence and obtaining benevolence, what is there to complain about," and our ears will be much quieter.

    But unfortunately, everyone does not want to do this, but insists on imposing on others, so the world has many troubles. "Fair Play" is particularly harmful, and can even be changed into a weakness, giving evil forces an advantage. For example, Liu Baizhao beat and dragged the female students of the Women's Normal University, and the "Modern Review" did not even fart, but when the Women's Normal University was restored, Chen Xiyang incited the female students to occupy the school, saying, "If they do not want to leave, what should we do? You can't forcefully move their things away, right?" Beating, dragging, and moving are all precedents of Liu Baizhao, why is this time alone "not good"? This is because they smelled the "Fair Play" flavor of the Women's Normal University. But this "Fair Play" has become a weakness and has been used by others to protect the legacy of Zhang Shizhao.

    VIII. Conclusion

    Someone might suspect that what I said above will provoke new and old, or what two factions' struggles, making evil feelings deeper, or making them more intense. But I dare to say that the counter-revolutionaries' harm to the reformers has never been relaxed, and the means of cruelty have already been to the extreme. Only the reformers are still in a dream, always suffering losses, and thus China has never been reformed. From now on, the attitude and methods should be changed.

    论“费厄泼赖”应该缓行
    鲁迅
    编者按：四十二年前鲁迅在《论“费厄泼赖”应该缓行》这篇文章中，就告诉我们，一定要打落水狗。他说：“倘是咬人之狗，我觉得都在可打之列，无论它在岸上或在水中。”
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，不仅是“咬人之狗”，而且是一伙吃人的野兽。他们虽然已被广大无产阶级革命派揪了出来，成了“落水狗”，但是，他们人还在，心不死。他们每时每刻都在伺机反扑，妄图东山再起，重新上台。我们无产阶级革命派一定要记住鲁迅的话，用痛打落水狗的精神，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行大批判、大斗争，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底把他们批倒、批垮、批臭，让他们遗臭万年，永世不得翻身！
    有的人认为，对走资本主义道路当权派只要点了名或者罢了官，就算是死老虎了。这种看法是错误的。一切大大小小的党内走资本主义道路的当权派，他们是纸老虎，但不是死老虎。我们还没有把他们彻底批倒、批臭，他们还是活老虎。他们会竭力装作无害而且可怜的样子。不过千万不要忘记他们是蛇一样的恶人。他们顶多算是冻僵了的蛇。一旦苏醒过来就会咬人。因此，我们一定要记住毛主席的教导：“决不怜惜蛇一样的恶人”，假如我们不加警惕，不搞大批判，他们就有可能复辟，搞一个反革命联合，把劳动人民淹没在血泊中。假如我们不忘记许多历史上的血的教训，就一定要搞大批判，否则就是对无产阶级革命事业的背叛。
    这次史无前例的文化大革命，就是大破剥削阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想，也就是大立毛泽东思想。让毛泽东思想占领各个阵地。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派是腐朽透顶的垃圾堆。在思想阵地上彻底扫除这些垃圾堆，对我们大立毛泽东思想，对培养无产阶级革命事业的接班人，都有很大的好处。当前我们应该把革命的大批判推向新高潮。
    对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，展开革命的大批判，这是毛主席伟大战略部署的重要组成部分，是关系到无产阶级文化大革命成败的大事。把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，在全中国人民和全世界人民面前彻底批倒、批臭，将推动无产阶级文化大革命更好的前进，将对世界各国人民的革命斗争产生深远的影响。
    一  解题
    《语丝》五七期上语堂先生曾经讲起“费厄泼赖”（Fairplay）①，以为此种精神在中国最不易得，我们只好努力鼓励；又谓不“打落水狗”，即足以补充“费厄泼赖”的意义。我不懂英文，因此也不明这字的函义究竟怎样，如果不“打落水狗”也即这种精神之一体，则我却很想有所议论。但题目上不直书“打落水狗”者，乃为回避触目起见，即并不一定要在头上强装“义角”②之意。总而言之，不过说是“落水狗”未始不可打，或者简直应该打而已。
    二　论“落水狗”有三种，大都在可打之列今之论者，常将“打死老虎”与“打落水狗”相提并论，以为都近于卑怯。我以为“打死老虎”者，装怯作勇，颇含滑稽，虽然不免有卑怯之嫌，却怯得令人可爱。至于“打落水狗”，则并不如此简单，当看狗之怎样，以及如何落水而定。考落水原因，大概可有三种：（1）狗自己失足落水者，（2）别人打落者，（3）亲自打落者。倘遇前二种，便即附和去打，自然过于无聊，或者竟近于卑怯；但若与狗奋战，亲手打其落水，则虽用竹竿又在水中从而痛打之，似乎也非已甚，不得与前二者同论。
    听说刚勇的拳师，决不再打那已经倒地的敌手，这实足使我们奉为楷模。但我以为尚须附加一事，即敌手也须是刚勇的斗士，一败之后，或自愧自悔而不再来，或尚须堂皇地来相报复，那当然都无不可。而于狗，却不能引此为例，与对等的敌手齐观，因为无论它怎样狂嗥，其实并不解什么“道义”；况且狗是能浮水的，一定仍要爬到岸上，倘不注意，它先就耸身一摇，将水点洒得人们一身一脸，于是夹着尾巴逃走了。但后来性情还是如此。老实人将它的落水认作受洗，以为必已忏悔，不再出而咬人，实在是大错而特错的事。
    总之，倘是咬人之狗，我觉得都在可打之列，无论它在岸上或在水中。
    三　论叭儿狗尤非打落水里，又从而打之不可叭儿狗一名哈吧狗，南方却称为西洋狗了，但是，听说倒是中国的特产，在万国赛狗会里常常得到金奖牌，《大不列颠百科全书》的狗照相上，就很有几匹是咱们中国的叭儿狗。这也是一种国光。但是，狗和猫不是仇敌么？它却虽然是狗，又很象猫，折中，公允，调和，平正之状可掬，悠悠然摆出别个无不偏激，惟独自己得了“中庸之道”似的脸来。因此也就为阔人，太监，太太，小姐们所钟爱，种子绵绵不绝。它的事业，只是以伶俐的皮毛获得贵人豢养，或者中外的娘儿们上街的时候，脖子上拴了细链子跟在脚后跟。
    这些就应该先行打它落水，又从而打之；如果它自坠入水，其实也不妨又从而打之，但若是自己过于要好，自然不打亦可，然而也不必为之叹息。叭儿狗如可宽容，别的狗也大可不必打了，因为它们虽然非常势利，但究竟还有些象狼，带着野性，不至于如此骑墙。
    以上是顺便说及的话，似乎和本题没有大关系。
    四　论不“打落水狗”是误人子弟的
    总之，落水狗的是否该打，第一是在看它爬上岸了之后的态度。
    狗性总不大会改变的，假使一万年之后，或者也许要和现在不同，但我现在要说的是现在。如果以为落水之后，十分可怜，则害人的动物，可怜者正多，便是霍乱病菌，虽然生殖得快，那性格却何等地老实。然而医生是决不肯放过它的。
    现在的官僚和土绅士或洋绅士，只要不合自意的，便说是赤化，是共产；民国元年以前稍不同，先是说康党，后是说革党③，甚至于到官里去告密，一面固然在保全自己的尊荣，但也未始没有那时所谓“以人血染红顶子”④之意。可是革命终于起来了，一群臭架子的绅士们，便立刻皇皇然若丧家之狗，将小辫子盘在头顶上。革命党也一派新气，——绅士们先前所深恶痛绝的新气，“文明”得可以；说是“咸与维新”了，我们是不打落水狗的，听凭它们爬上来罢。于是它们爬上来了，伏到民国二年下半年，二次革命的时候，就突出来帮着袁世凯咬死了许多革命人，中国又一天一天沈入黑暗里，一直到现在，遗老不必说，连遗少也还是那么多。这就因为先烈的好心，对于鬼蜮的慈悲，使它们繁殖起来，而此后的明白青年，为反抗黑暗计，也就要花费更多更多的气力和生命。
    秋瑾女士，就是死于告密的，革命后暂时称为“女侠”，现在是不大听见有人提起了。革命一起，她的故乡就到了一个都督，——等于现在之所谓督军，——也是她的同志：王金发。他捉住了杀害她的谋主，调集了告密的案卷，要为她报仇。然而终于将那谋主释放了，据说是因为已经成了民国，大家不应该再修旧怨罢。但等到二次革命失败后，王金发却被袁世凯的走狗枪决了，与有力的是他所释放的杀过秋瑾的谋主。
    这人现在也已“寿终正寝”了，但在那里继续跋扈出没着的也还是这一流人，所以秋瑾的故乡也还是那样的故乡，年复一年，丝毫没有长进。从这一点看起来，生长在可为中国模范的名城里的杨荫榆女士和陈西瀅先生，真是洪福齐天。
    五　论塌台人物不当与“落水狗”相提并论
    “犯而不校”⑤是恕道，“以眼还眼以牙还牙”是直道。中国最多的却是枉道：不打落水狗，反被狗咬了。但是，这其实是老实人自己讨苦吃。
    俗语说：“忠厚是无用的别名”，也许太刻薄一点罢，但仔细想来，却也觉得并非唆人作恶之谈，乃是归纳了许多苦楚的经历之后的警句。譬如不打落水狗说，其成因大概有二：一是无力打；二是比例错。前者且勿论；后者的大错就又有二：一是误将塌台人物和落水狗齐观，二是不辨塌台人物又有好有坏，于是视同一律，结果反成为纵恶。即以现在而论，因为政局的不安定，真是此起彼伏如转轮，坏人靠着冰山，恣行无忌，一旦失足，忽而乞怜，而曾经亲见，或亲受其噬啮的老实人，乃忽以“落水狗”视之，不但不打，甚至于还有哀矜之意，自以为公理已伸，侠义这时正在我这里。殊不知它何尝真是落水，巢窟是早已造好的了，食料是早经储足的了，并且都在租界里。虽然有时似乎受伤，其实并不，至多不过是假装跛脚，聊以引起人们的恻隐之心，可以从容避匿罢了。他日复来，仍旧先咬老实人开手，“投石下井”，无所不为，寻起原因来，一部分就正因为老实人不“打落水狗”之故。所以，要是说得苛刻一点，也就是自家掘坑自家埋，怨天尤人，全是错误的。
    六　论现在还不能一味“费厄”
    仁人们或者要问：那么，我们竟不要“费厄泼赖”么？我可以立刻回答：当然是要的，然而尚早。这就是“请君入瓮”⑥法。虽然仁人们未必肯用，但我还可以言之成理。土绅士或洋绅士们不是常常说，中国自有特别国情，外国的平等自由等等，不能适用么？我以为这“费厄泼赖”也是其一。否则，他对你不“费厄”，你却对他去“费厄”，结果总是自己吃亏，不但要
  “费厄”而不可得，并且连要不“费厄”而亦不可得。所以要“费厄”，最好是首先看清对手，倘是些不配承受“费厄”的，大可以老实不客气；待到它也“费厄”了，然后再与它讲“费厄”不迟。
    这似乎很有主张二重道德之嫌，但是也出于不得已，因为倘不如此，中国将不能有较好的路。中国现在有许多二重道德，主与奴，男与女，都有不同的道德，还没有划一。要是对“落水狗”和“落水人”独独一视同仁，实在未免太偏，太早，正如绅士们之所谓自由平等并非不好，在中国却微嫌太早一样。所以倘有人要普遍施行“费厄泼赖”精神，我以为至少须俟所谓“落水狗”者带有人气之后。但现在自然也非绝不可行，就是，有如上文所说：要看清对手。而且还要有等差，即“费厄”必视对手之如何而施，无论其怎样落水，为人也则帮之，为狗也则不管之，为坏狗也则打之。一言以蔽之：“党同伐异”⑦而已矣。
    满心“婆理”而满口“公理”的绅士们的名言暂且置之不论不议之列，即使真心人所大叫的公理，在现今的中国，也还不能救助好人，甚至于反而保护坏人。因为当坏人得志，虐待好人的时候，即使有人大叫公理，他决不听从，叫喊仅止于叫喊，好人仍然受苦。然而偶有一时，好人或稍稍蹶起，则坏人本该落水了，可是，真心的公理论者又“勿报复”呀，“仁恕”呀，“勿以恶抗恶”呀……的大嚷起来。这一次却发生实效，并非空嚷了：好人正以为然，而坏人于是得救。但他得救之后，无非以为占了便宜，何尝改悔；并且因为是早已营就三窟，又善于钻谋的，所以不多时，也就依然声势赫奕，作恶又如先前一样。这时候，公理论者自然又要大叫，但这回他却不听你了。
    但是，“疾恶太严”，“操之过急”，汉的清流和明的东林，却正以这一点倾败，论者也常常这样责备他们。殊不知那一面，何尝不“疾善如仇”呢？人们却不说一句话。假使此后光明和黑暗还不能作彻底的战斗，老实人误将纵恶当作宽容，一味姑息下去，则现在似的混沌状态，是可以无穷无尽的。
    七　论“即以其人之道还治其人之身”
    中国人或信中医或信西医，现在较大的城市中往往并有两种医，使他们各得其所。我以为这确是极好的事。倘能推而广之，怨声一定还要少得多，或者天下竟可以臻于郅治。例如民国的通礼是鞠躬，但若有人以为不对的，就独使他磕头。民国的法律是没有笞刑的，倘有人以为肉刑好，则这人犯罪时就特别打屁股。碗筷饭菜，是为今人而设的，有愿为燧人氏以前之民者，就请他吃生肉；再造几千间茅屋，将在大宅子里仰慕尧舜的高士都拉出来，给住在那里面；反对物质文明的，自然更应该不使他衔冤坐汽车。这样一办，真所谓“求仁得仁又何怨”，我们的耳根也就可以清净许多罢。
    但可惜大家总不肯这样办，偏要以己律人，所以天下就多事。“费厄泼赖”尤其有流弊，甚至于可以变成弱点，反给恶势力占便宜。例如刘百昭殴曳女师大学生，《现代评论》上连屁也不放，一到女师大恢复，陈西瀅鼓动女大学生占据校舍时，却道“要是她们不肯走便怎样呢？你们总不好意思用强力把她们的东西搬走了吧？”殴而且拉，而且搬，是有刘百昭的先例的，何以这一回独独“不好意思”？这就因为给他嗅到了女师大这一面有些“费厄”气味之故。但这“费厄”却又变成弱点，反而给人利用了来替章士钊的“遗泽”保镳。
    八　结末
    或者要疑我上文所言，会激起新旧，或什么两派之争，使恶感更深，或相持更烈罢。但我敢断言，反改革者对于改革者的毒害，向来就并未放松过，手段的厉害也已经无以复加了。只有改革者却还在睡梦里，总是吃亏，因而中国也总是没有改革，自此以后，是应该改换些态度和方法的。
                  一九二五年十二月二十九日。
    名词注释
    ＊　本文最初发表于一九二六年一月十日《莽原》半月刊第一期，见《鲁迅全集》第一卷第三五二页。
    ①　“费厄泼赖”：英语译音，原先是体育运动的竞赛和其他竞技所用的术语，意思是光明正大的比赛，不要用不正当的手段。后来，资产阶级借此宣扬党派之间的斗争应有这种所谓“绅士风度”。其目的完全是为了掩盖自己的丑恶面目并麻痹革命的人民。
    ②　“义角”：就是假角，是一个反动文人攻击鲁迅的话。意思是说，鲁迅为了讨好读者而假装成一个战斗者，就象“在鬼头上装上义角”。鲁迅在这里顺便提到，给以反击。
    ③　康党、革党：康党，指曾经参加和赞成一八九八年康有为等发动戊戌变法维新的人。革党，即革命党，指参加和赞成反清革命的人。
    ④　红顶子：清朝官服，用不同质料和颜色的帽顶子，来分别官阶的高低。最高的一品大员是用红珊瑚珠做顶子。清末的官僚和绅士常有以告密和捕杀革命党人作为升官的手段的。当时称这种人“以人血染红顶子”。
    ⑤　犯而不校：见《论语·泰伯》，意思是被人触犯了，不去计较。
    ⑥　请君入瓮：唐朝酷吏周兴，为了使犯人招供，用炭火把大瓮烧热，迫使犯人入瓮。后来有人控告周兴谋反，另一酷吏用同样办法迫使他招认。
    ⑦　党同伐异：原意是无原则地分立门户派别，偏袒同党，攻击异己。反动文人曾用这句话攻击鲁迅。鲁迅在这里引用这句话，一方面为了揭穿敌人的假面具，一方面坚持正义立场，明确表示革命与反革命之间不可能也不应该妥协。
