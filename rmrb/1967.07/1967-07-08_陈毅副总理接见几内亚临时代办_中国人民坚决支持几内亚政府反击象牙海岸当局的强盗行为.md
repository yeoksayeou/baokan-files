Vice Premier Chen Yi Meets Guinea's Chargé d'Affaires
The Chinese People Strongly Support the Guinean Government in Countering the Piratical Acts of the Ivory Coast Authorities

BEIJING, July 7 (Xinhua) — This afternoon, Vice Premier and Foreign Minister Chen Yi met with Kamara, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Guinean Embassy in China. Chen Yi, on behalf of the Chinese government, strongly condemned the imperialist collusion with the reactionary authorities of the Ivory Coast in illegally abducting the Guinean delegation led by Foreign Minister Lansana Beavogui as a piratical act.

Vice Premier Chen Yi pointed out that this abduction incident was premeditated by the imperialist clique and is a serious crime against the Guinean government and people. It is also a serious provocation to the people of Asia and Africa. Because Guinea insists on national independence and the just struggle against imperialism and colonialism, imperialism harbors deep hatred for Guinea, viewing it as a thorn in its side, and always trying to uproot it. We believe that the Guinean people will definitely be able to thoroughly smash the imperialists' evil plots. At present, imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries are causing trouble everywhere in the world, but they are doomed to failure.

Vice Premier Chen Yi expressed great concern for the safety of the Guinean delegation members and sternly pointed out that the Ivory Coast authorities must immediately and unconditionally release all members of the Guinean delegation. Chen Yi, on behalf of the Chinese government and people, expressed resolute support for the Guinean government's just actions in countering imperialism and the Ivory Coast authorities.

　　陈毅副总理接见几内亚临时代办
　　中国人民坚决支持几内亚政府反击象牙海岸当局的强盗行为
    新华社七日讯　今天下午，陈毅副总理兼外长接见几内亚共和国驻华大使馆临时代办卡马拉，代表我国政府强烈谴责帝国主义伙同象牙海岸反动当局非法绑架以外交部长朗萨纳·贝阿沃吉为首的几内亚代表团的强盗行为。
    陈毅副总理指出，这次绑架事件，是帝国主义集团预谋的，是反对几内亚政府和人民的又一次严重罪行，也是对亚非人民的严重挑衅。由于几内亚坚持民族独立，坚持反帝反殖的正义斗争，因此帝国主义对几内亚十分仇视，把它当作眼中钉，总是千方百计想把它拔掉。我们相信几内亚人民一定能够彻底粉碎帝国主义的罪恶阴谋。现在，帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派正在世界各地到处捣乱，但是他们注定是要失败的。
    陈毅副总理对几内亚代表团成员的安全表示十分关切，并严正指出，象牙海岸当局必须立即无条件释放几内亚代表团全体人员。陈毅副总理代表中国政府和中国人民，表示坚决支持几内亚政府对帝国主义和象牙海岸当局进行反击的正义行动。
