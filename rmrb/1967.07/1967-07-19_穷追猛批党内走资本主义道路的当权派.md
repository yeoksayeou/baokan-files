"To carry the revolution through to the end, we must use revolutionary methods to thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminate all reactionary forces."

The revolutionary masses of more than fifty units in the Beijing area of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have conducted a comprehensive criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist lines in scientific research, personnel, organization, party-building, and foreign affairs. The revolutionary criticism has further promoted a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and has promoted revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

Xinhua News Agency, July 18th: "It is better to exhaust one's strength in pursuing the enemy than to seek fame by learning from the conqueror." The revolutionary masses of more than fifty units in the Beijing area of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, who have achieved revolutionary unity from the bottom up, have raised high the banner of revolutionary criticism under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. They have carried forward the spirit of thorough revolution, criticizing and attacking the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Academy. In the past two months, a high tide of mass exposure, criticism, and struggle has been formed throughout the Academy.

After winning the struggle to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, the revolutionary masses of the Chinese Academy of Sciences have not relaxed their vigilance against the class enemy for a single moment. They have firmly remembered the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching: "To carry the revolution through to the end, we must use revolutionary methods to thoroughly, completely, and cleanly eliminate all reactionary forces." They have always regarded the exposure, criticism, and struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Academy as the most important task. After the publication of Chairman Mao's five brilliant documents on literature and art, the May 16th Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, and relevant editorials in the "Red Flag" magazine and the "People's Daily," the Revolutionary Rebel Alliance of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing area) immediately made a decision to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works and to focus on criticism and struggle. They called on all revolutionary masses, revolutionary workers, and revolutionary cadres throughout the Academy to seriously study the above important documents, wage a people's war, and criticize the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Academy politically, ideologically, and theoretically, exposing and denouncing them thoroughly.

Through the intensive study, application, discussion, and recitation of Chairman Mao's brilliant works, the broad revolutionary masses, revolutionary workers, and revolutionary cadres have deeply realized that the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party are the kind of people that Chairman Mao pointed out, who, once the time is ripe, will seize power and turn our country from a dictatorship of the proletariat into a dictatorship of the bourgeoisie. If we do not criticize them thoroughly, expose them, and denounce them, and if we do not thoroughly eliminate the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison they have spread in various fields, one day these "fallen dogs" will crawl back to power, regain their influence, bark and bite wildly, and will put the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses to death. At that time, the socialist mountains and rivers won by countless revolutionary martyrs and the brilliant achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will be in vain, and all will be lost. Through study, the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres have raised their consciousness, taken action, and formed a high tide of mass connections, investigations, exposures, and criticisms throughout the Academy. Due to the need for criticism, more than thirty specialized criticism liaison stations have been organized by the masses, which have conducted a comprehensive, systematic, and in-depth exposure and criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist lines in scientific research, personnel, organization, party-building, and foreign affairs that the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Academy have long been promoting. The broad revolutionary masses, revolutionary workers, and revolutionary cadres have become the main force of the great criticism movement in the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Some masses who were previously deceived and joined the wrong side have also taken active action and joined this magnificent criticism movement. The broad revolutionary masses warmly welcome those cadres who have made mistakes, even serious mistakes, to participate in the revolutionary criticism, allowing them to educate themselves and liberate themselves through revolutionary struggle, redeem themselves, and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line as soon as possible. Some erring cadres have directly participated in the criticism liaison stations and fought alongside the revolutionary masses. Some elderly scientific workers, even family members, have also joined this revolutionary criticism movement.

The revolutionary criticism movement has further promoted a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" in the Chinese Academy of Sciences. A combat team participating in the "Criticism of the Revisionist Scientific Research Line Liaison Station" in a certain research institute initially could not grasp the essence of the revisionist scientific research line. They sat down and seriously studied Chairman Mao's series of instructions on scientific research work. They realized that the entire revisionist scientific research line promoted by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Chinese Academy of Sciences is a thorough betrayal of the dictatorship of the proletariat. They attempted to turn scientific research work into a tool for the restoration of capitalism. Through studying Chairman Mao's works, the combat team proposed a comprehensive plan to criticize the revisionist scientific research line, striking at the heart of the revisionist scientific research line.

In the revolutionary criticism movement, the revolutionary masses, revolutionary workers, and revolutionary cadres of the Academy have also fiercely fought against the "self" in their minds, striving to change their worldview and promote revolutionary unity. Some revolutionary mass organizations with different viewpoints have realized that among all contradictions, the contradiction with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party is the principal contradiction. They jointly participated in the same criticism liaison station, forming a unified combat collective, and directing their spearheads at the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the Academy. In the joint struggle, they gradually eliminated their estrangement and strengthened their unity. Many revolutionary cadres have already stood up in the revolutionary criticism movement, gaining the support and trust of the masses, and creating conditions for the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

The broad revolutionary masses, revolutionary workers, and revolutionary cadres of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and boundless loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, harbor deep hatred for the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. They are determined to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, combine the revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, and launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism in the Chinese Academy of Sciences, building the Chinese Academy of Sciences into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    “如果要使革命进行到底，那就是用革命的方法，坚决彻底干净全部地消灭一切反动势力”。
    穷追猛批党内走资本主义道路的当权派
    科学院北京地区五十多个单位的无产阶级革命派，全面地批判了反革命修正主义的科研、干部、组织、建党和外事路线。革命的大批判，进一步促进了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，促进了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”
    新华社十八日讯　“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”已经实现了自下而上的革命大联合的中国科学院北京地区五十多个单位的无产阶级革命派，高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判大旗，发扬痛打“落水狗”的彻底革命精神，口诛笔伐，穷追猛打党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和科学院内一小撮反革命修正主义分子。近两个月来，已经在全院范围内形成了一个群众性的大揭发、大批判、大斗争的高潮。
    中国科学院的无产阶级革命派，取得了向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争的胜利以后，一刻也没有放松对阶级敌人的警惕。他们牢记伟大领袖毛主席的“如果要使革命进行到底，那就是用革命的方法，坚决彻底干净全部地消灭一切反动势力”的教导，始终把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和对科学院内一小撮反革命修正主义分子的大揭发、大批判、大斗争，看作是头等重要的大事。毛主席关于文学艺术的五个光辉文件、中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》和《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》的有关社论发表后，中国科学院（京区）革命造反派联合夺权委员会又立即作出在大批判中活学活用毛主席著作和狠抓大批判、大斗争的决定，号召全院广大革命群众、革命工人和革命干部认真学习上述重要文献，打一场人民战争，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和科学院内的一小撮反革命修正主义分子从政治上、思想上、理论上批深批透，批倒批臭。
    广大革命群众、革命工人和革命干部通过大学、大用、大讲、大背毛主席的有关光辉著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装了自己的头脑后，深刻地认识到，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就是毛主席指出的那种一旦时机成熟就会要夺取政权，把我国由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政的赫鲁晓夫式的人物，如果不把他们批深批透，批倒批臭，彻底肃清他们在各个领域中散布的反革命修正主义的流毒，有朝一日，这些“落水狗”爬上岸来，重新得势，狂吠乱咬，必将置无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众于死地，到那时，无数革命先烈流血牺牲打下的社会主义江山，无产阶级文化大革命取得的辉煌成果，就会付之东流，废于一旦。全院广大革命群众和革命干部通过学习提高了认识，纷纷行动起来，在全院范围内形成了一个大串连、大调查、大揭发、大批判的热潮。由于大批判的需要，全院出现了三十多个由群众自动串连组织起来的各种专题性的批判联络站，这些联络站对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和科学院内一小撮反革命修正主义分子，长期以来推行的反革命修正主义的科研路线、干部路线、组织路线、建党路线、外事路线等，进行了全面、系统、深入的揭发、批判。广大的革命群众、革命工人和革命干部成了中国科学院大批判的主力军，一些过去受蒙蔽而站错了队的群众，也积极行动起来，投入了这场轰轰烈烈的大批判运动。广大革命群众热情欢迎那些过去犯过错误甚至严重错误的干部参加革命的大批判，让他们在革命斗争的实践中，自己教育自己，自己解放自己，立功赎罪，尽早地回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。有些犯错误的干部，直接参加了大批判联络站，和革命群众一起战斗。一些年老的科学工作者，甚至家属，也都投入到了这场革命的大批判运动中来。
    革命的大批判运动，进一步促进了中国科学院活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮和革命的大联合、“三结合”。某研究所参加“批判修正主义科研路线联络站”的一个战斗组，一开始抓不住修正主义科研路线的要害，他们就坐下来，认真地学习了毛主席有关科研工作的一系列指示，他们认识到党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和中国科学院一小撮反革命修正主义分子所推行的一整套修正主义的科研路线，是彻头彻尾地背叛无产阶级专政的，他们企图把科学研究工作变成为资本主义复辟服务的工具。通过学习毛主席著作，这个战斗组提出了一整套批判修正主义科研路线的作战方案，击中了修正主义科研路线的要害。
    科学院的革命群众、革命工人和革命干部，在革命的大批判运动中还狠斗自己头脑中的“私”字，努力改造自己的世界观，促进革命的大联合。一些不同观点的革命群众组织认识到，千矛盾，万矛盾，与党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾是最主要的矛盾。他们共同参加同一个大批判的联络站，形成了一个统一的战斗集体，把矛头紧紧对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和科学院的一小撮反革命修正主义分子。在共同战斗中，他们渐渐消除了隔阂，增强了团结。许多革命干部，已经在革命的大批判运动中站了起来，获得了群众的支持和信任，为革命的“三结合”创造了条件。
    中国科学院广大革命群众、革命工人和革命干部，满怀对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱和对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的无限忠诚，无比仇恨党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，他们决心更好地在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，把革命的大批判和本单位的斗、批、改结合起来，在中国科学院掀起一个革命的大批判的新高潮，把中国科学院建设成为一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
