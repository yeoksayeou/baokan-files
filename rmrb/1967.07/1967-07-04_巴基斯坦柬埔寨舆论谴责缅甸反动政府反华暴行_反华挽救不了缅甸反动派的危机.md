Pakistani and Cambodian public opinion condemns Myanmar's reactionary government's anti-China atrocities

The anti-China actions will not save Myanmar's reactionary regime from its crisis

	RAWALPINDI, July 3 — Pakistani public opinion has expressed strong indignation at the heinous crimes committed by the Myanmar reactionary government in instigating mobs to massacre Chinese nationals and murder a Chinese expert inside the Chinese embassy in Myanmar.

	Journalist Naeem wrote to the Xinhua News Agency's Rawalpindi bureau, "The Myanmar government's orchestration of anti-China incidents aims to divert the attention of the Myanmar people from the domestic economic difficulties. These difficulties are the result of the Myanmar government's reactionary rule and its reliance on U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism."

	The letter said, "The blood of these murdered Chinese people will not be shed in vain. Revolution will triumph, the people will triumph; all imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries will be swallowed by the surging waves of people's resistance and struggle."

	A social worker from Layyah said that while the armed struggle of the Myanmar people against the reactionary rule is developing, the Myanmar government attempts to save itself by creating anti-China violence. This is futile, just like a drowning man clutching at a straw.

	An employee of the telegraph office said that the Myanmar government's creation of anti-China incidents and the murder of innocent Chinese nationals will inevitably lead to its own downfall.

	PHNOM PENH, July 1 — The Cambodian newspaper "New Telegraph" published a commentary on July 1, condemning the unprecedented barbaric fascist anti-China and anti-Chinese violence orchestrated by the Myanmar reactionary government. The commentary said, "The anti-China violence that occurred in various places is ultimately the work of reactionaries using fascist organizations."

	The commentary sternly pointed out that this anti-China movement is not an accidental event. It is the result of a grand plan aimed not only at attempting to isolate People's China but also at overthrowing governments in this region that refuse to submit to the major powers. For the U.S. imperialists and others, People's China is the number one enemy that must be eliminated.

	The commentary said, "China is an obstacle to their policy of dominating the world. China also makes those who betray the cause of justice and progress in various countries feel embarrassed. Therefore, it is not surprising that People's China and its people have aroused the deep hatred of those who seek to perpetuate their rule and power."

	The commentary pointed out that when Washington and other capitals of major powers start their anti-China propaganda machines, certain countries join in the anti-China chorus and carry out anti-China violence. The commentary said, "It is not difficult to see who is conducting the orchestra."

	The commentary said, "The Americans and their followers are trying to extinguish the desire for independence in all countries in this region. To do this, as a first step, they must sever the relations between these countries and their most reliable friends. This is the root of the anti-China movement. Even to the extent of worsening relations between countries to suit the needs of imperialism, that is, to overthrow any government and regime that shows even a little disobedience to Washington. The commentary warned that in the current situation, the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency and its Asian branches are working at full capacity, and this is a lesson that should be drawn from current realities."

　　巴基斯坦柬埔寨舆论谴责缅甸反动政府反华暴行
　　反华挽救不了缅甸反动派的危机
    新华社拉瓦尔品第二日电　巴基斯坦公众舆论对缅甸反动政府唆使暴徒残害中国侨胞，并在中国驻缅甸大使馆内杀害一位中国专家的滔天罪行，表示极为愤慨。
    新闻工作者纳伊姆在给新华社拉瓦尔品第分社的信中说，缅甸政府制造反华事件，目的在于转移缅甸人民对国内经济困难的注意。这些困难是缅甸政府实行反动统治和投靠美帝及苏修而造成的。
    信中说：“这些被杀害的中国人的血不会白流。革命将会胜利，人民将会胜利；所有的帝国主义者、修正主义者和反动派将会被人民反抗和斗争的巨浪所吞没。”
    莱雅普尔的一位社会工作者说，在缅甸人民反对反动统治的武装斗争正在发展的时候，缅甸政府企图用制造反华暴行来挽救自身的危机。这是徒劳的，正象一个快要淹死的人抓住了一根稻草一样。
    电报局的一位工作人员说，缅甸政府制造反华事件，杀害无辜的中国侨胞，这必将使它碰得头破血流。
    新华社金边一日电柬埔寨《新电讯报》一日就缅甸反动政府制造空前野蛮的法西斯反华排华暴行发表评论说，“各地发生反华暴行，终归都是反动分子利用法西斯性质的组织搞出的勾当。”
    评论严正指出，这个反华运动决不是什么偶然的事情。这是一个庞大计划所产生的结果，这个计划的目的不仅在于企图孤立人民中国，而且企图在世界这一地区打倒拒绝向大国屈服的那些政权。对美帝和其他一些人来说，人民中国是非消灭不可的头号敌人。
    评论说，中国是妨碍他们推行主宰世界政策的障碍。中国还使得背叛伸张正义和争取进步的各国人民的事业的另外一些人感到狼狈。因此，人民中国及其人民，引起企图永久保持自己的统治和势力的那些人的刻骨仇恨，这是不奇怪的。评论指出，当华盛顿和其他一些大国的首都开动反华宣传机器的时候，某些国家就参加反华大合唱，采取反华暴行。评论说，这不难识破谁在挥舞指挥棒。
    评论说，美国人及其追随者妄图扑灭这个地区各国争取独立的一切愿望。为此，作为第一步，就必须切断这些国家同它们的最可靠的朋友之间的关系。这就是反华运动的根源。甚至使国与国之间关系恶化，以适应帝国主义的需要，即推翻只要表现出有一点对华盛顿“不听话”的一切政权和政府。评论警告说，在当前的情况下，美国中央情报局及其亚洲分支机构在开足马力大肆活动，这是应该从当前现实中得出的教训。
