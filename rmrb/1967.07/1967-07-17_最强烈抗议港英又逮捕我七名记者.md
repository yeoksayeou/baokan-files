The strongest protest against the British in Hong Kong for arresting seven of our journalists

Serious warning to the British authorities in Hong Kong: They must immediately release the Xinhua News Agency journalists and other patriotic journalists, apologize to the victims, compensate for the losses, ensure the normal business activities and safety of Xinhua News Agency personnel, punish those responsible for the arrests, and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again.

Xinhua News Agency, July 17th: The All-China Journalists Association issued a statement on the 17th, strongly protesting the fascist actions of the British authorities in Hong Kong in illegally arresting two journalists from the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch and five other patriotic journalists.

The statement said that the British fascist authorities in Hong Kong, despite the solemn protests from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the press, illegally arrested two journalists from the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch and five other patriotic journalists on July 15th. The British fascist bandits' stubborn enmity towards the Chinese people and their increasingly savage persecution of Xinhua News Agency journalists and others are crimes that the 700 million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, absolutely cannot tolerate. Therefore, the All-China Journalists Association strongly protests against the British authorities in Hong Kong.

The statement said that the British authorities in Hong Kong have recently escalated their persecution of Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, committing all sorts of atrocities, which has provoked the extreme indignation of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon and made them more courageously fight back. The British imperialists fear that their fascist atrocities will be further exposed and that the heroic deeds of the Chinese people in their anti-British struggle will be reported, so they have repeatedly disrupted the normal business activities of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch journalists and other patriotic journalists, endangering their personal safety. All this only further exposes the brutal and cowardly nature of the British authorities in Hong Kong.

The statement said that Chinese journalists seriously warn the British authorities in Hong Kong: You must immediately release the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch journalists Xue Ping, Chen Fengying, Chen Demu, and other patriotic newspaper journalists who were illegally arrested, apologize to the victims, compensate for all losses, and ensure the normal business activities and personal safety of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch journalists and staff. Punish those responsible for the arrest of journalists and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again. Otherwise, all serious consequences must be borne by you.

The statement said that Chinese journalists remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. From a long-term perspective, the truly powerful force does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people." We firmly believe that the Chinese people are the masters of Hong Kong's destiny. The patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, with perseverance and resolute struggle, will surely achieve the final victory in the anti-British struggle.

According to Xinhua News Agency on July 17th: After the British fascist authorities in Hong Kong illegally arrested Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch journalist Xue Ping, they arbitrarily arrested Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch journalists Chen Fengying and Chen Demu, who were conducting normal reporting activities, and five other Chinese journalists from patriotic newspapers in the afternoon of the 15th. For this, Xinhua News Agency sent a telegram to the British authorities in Hong Kong, strongly protesting again.

The protest telegram said that the British authorities in Hong Kong, despite repeated serious warnings from China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Xinhua News Agency, stubbornly opposed the Chinese people and escalated their savage persecution of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch journalists and patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, which is absolutely intolerable to the compatriots in Hong Kong and the 700 million Chinese people.

The protest telegram sternly warned the British authorities in Hong Kong: You must immediately release the detained personnel, admit your guilt, and compensate for all losses; ensure the normal business activities and personal safety of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch staff, punish those responsible for the arrest of journalists, and guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again.

The protest telegram warned that the British authorities in Hong Kong must stop in their tracks, immediately stop the fascist atrocities against Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch staff and other Chinese journalists. If you ignore our repeated warnings and insist on going your own way, then you must bear full responsibility for all serious consequences that may arise.

    全国记协发表声明，新华社致电港英当局
    最强烈抗议港英又逮捕我七名记者
    严重警告港英当局：必须立即释放新华社记者和其他爱国记者，并向受害者道歉，赔偿损失；保证新华社人员的正常业务活动和安全；惩办逮捕记者的负责者；保证不再发生类似事件。
    新华社十七日讯　中华全国新闻工作者协会十七日发表声明，最强烈抗议港英法西斯当局又一次非法逮捕新华社香港分社两名记者和其他五名爱国记者的法西斯暴行。
    声明说，香港英国法西斯当局不顾我国外交部和新闻界的严正抗议，竟于七月十五日继续非法逮捕新华社香港分社两名记者及其他五名爱国记者。港英法西斯强盗这种顽固地同中国人民为敌，变本加厉地野蛮迫害新华社记者等的滔天罪行，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。为此，中华全国新闻工作者协会对港英当局提出最最强烈的抗议。
    声明说，港英当局对港九中国同胞的迫害最近连续升级，杀人放火，无恶不作，从而激起了港九爱国同胞的无比愤慨，并更加英勇地进行自卫斗争。港英帝国主义害怕自己的法西斯暴行被进一步揭露，害怕中国人民反英抗暴的英勇事迹被报道出来，于是他们竟一再地破坏新华社香港分社记者和其他爱国记者的正常业务活动，危害他们的人身安全。这一切只能进一步暴露出港英当局残暴而怯懦的本质。
    声明说，中国新闻工作者严重警告港英当局：你们必须立即释放新华社香港分社记者薛平、陈凤英、陈德穆以及被无理逮捕的其他爱国报纸记者，并向受害者道歉，赔偿一切损失；必须切实保障新华社香港分社记者和工作人员的正常业务活动和人身安全；惩办逮捕记者事件的负责者；保证今后不再发生类似事件。否则，一切严重后果，必须由你们全部承担。
    声明说，中国新闻工作者牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”我们坚信，中国人民是香港命运的掌握者，香港爱国同胞再接再厉，坚决斗争，必将取得反英抗暴斗争的最后胜利。
    据新华社十七日讯　港英法西斯当局在无理逮捕新华社香港分社记者薛平之后，又于十五日下午蛮横无理地逮捕了正在进行正常采访活动的新华社香港分社记者陈凤英、陈德穆和其它爱国报纸的五名中国记者，为此，新华通讯社致电港英当局再次提出最强烈、最严重的抗议。
    抗议电说，港英当局不顾中国外交部和新华通讯社一再严重警告，顽固地同中国人民为敌，变本加厉地对新华社香港分社记者和香港爱国同胞进行野蛮的迫害，这是香港同胞绝对不能容忍的，是七亿中国人民绝对不能容忍的。
    抗议电严正警告港英当局：你们必须立即释放被捕人员；低头认罪，并赔偿一切损失；保证新华社香港分社工作人员的正常业务活动和人身安全，惩办逮捕记者事件的负责者，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。
    抗议电警告说，港英当局必须悬崖勒马，立即停止对新华社香港分社工作人员和其他中国记者的法西斯暴行。如果你们不顾我们的一再警告，一意孤行，蛮干到底，那末，你们就必须对由此而引起的一切严重后果承担全部责任。
