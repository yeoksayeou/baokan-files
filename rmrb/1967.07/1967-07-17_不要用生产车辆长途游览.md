To the Editor:

Recently, every holiday, large numbers of people from Tianjin drive to Beijing for sightseeing. In front of Tiananmen and the Revolutionary Museum, many vehicles carrying tourists are parked. On the afternoon of July 2nd at 5 PM, just on the tree-lined avenue in front of the Revolutionary Museum, more than thirty vehicles of various types were parked. Using a large number of production and transportation vehicles in this way, consuming a large amount of gasoline, and indulging in long-distance travel and sightseeing at the state's expense, is not in line with the principle of "practicing economy." A citizen of Dongchang'an Street, Beijing

To the Editor:

Recently, we have noticed that many people from outside Beijing who come to "make complaints" are using monthly passes to roam around. For example, on a public bus, I saw seven people with monthly passes who had come to Beijing to "make complaints," discussing where to go today—thirteen tombs, tomorrow—Badaling, the day after tomorrow—and so on. They said, "Since we bought monthly passes, we can go anywhere."

In addition, we have recently seen many sightseeing cars from Tianjin. On July 9th alone, more than twenty were parked in front of the Summer Palace, and more than ten were parked at Fragrant Hills. Beijing Institute of Mining and Technology

    不要用生产车辆长途游览编辑同志：
    近来，每逢假日，都有大批人从天津开汽车到北京游览。在天安门前和革命博物馆前，停放很多载运游人的车辆。七月二日下午五时，仅在革命博物馆前林荫道上，就停放了各种汽车三十多部。这样动用大批生产运输车辆，耗费大量汽油，慷国家之慨，长途旅行游览，是不符合“厉行节约”原则的。　北京东长安街一市民编辑同志：
    最近，我们发现有不少外地来京“告状”的人，拿着月票到处游逛。如在一辆公共汽车上，我就看见有七个持有月票的赴京“告状”者，在一起谈论今天去十三陵、明天去八达岭、后天去……。并说反正买了月票可以到处逛。
    此外，我们近日还见到很多天津来的游览车，仅在九日那天，颐和园门前就停了二十多辆，香山停了十多辆。北京矿业学院　要军
