Black Snipers in Detroit Act Bravely and Intelligently, Striking Fear into the Enemy
Black Americans Hold Tight to Their Weapons and Persist in Armed Resistance

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 27th, a message from Washington: The largest armed resistance struggle in the history of the black people's struggle in the United States, which erupted in Detroit in the early hours of the 23rd, has persisted for four days and nights.

On the 26th, groups of black snipers (with some poor whites participating) were active in various parts of Detroit. Even before nightfall, they had entered the battle. They calmly and intelligently fired revenge bullets from rooftops, from windows, and from behind the ruins of burned buildings, catching the enemy off guard. They then quickly and safely retreated, striking fear into the enemy and making them run around in exhaustion. That afternoon, the snipers besieged a police station for over an hour, injuring two National Guard soldiers and one police officer on the spot. Under the heavy blows of the snipers, the armed police once retreated from a large area in the southeast of the city. Governor Romney exclaimed that the sniper activities on the 26th were "more intense than the previous days."

Inspired by the brave struggle of the black people in Detroit, on the evening of the 26th, more than ten important cities followed suit with black violent self-defense struggles. In South Bend, Indiana, groups of black youth retaliated against police suppression with stones and Molotov cocktails for two consecutive nights. The reactionary authorities brazenly declared martial law on the evening of the 26th and deployed a thousand National Guard soldiers to strengthen the suppression. In Phoenix, Arizona, black masses completely ignored the curfew order and took to the streets for two consecutive nights, striking back at the rampaging police with stones, glass bottles, homemade Molotov cocktails, and sniper activities. In the bustling downtown area of New York City, as well as in San Francisco, Philadelphia, Cincinnati, Toledo, and Dayton in Ohio, and in Niagara Falls, Michigan, black struggles of varying scales also broke out on the 26th.

Facing the surging tide of black violent self-defense struggles, the American ruling class was extremely anxious. On the 26th, Johnson made an appeal to American youth from the White House, urging them to "respect the law." The notorious agents of the American ruling class among the blacks, such as Martin Luther King, did not hesitate to discard their disguises and bare their fangs, publicly issuing statements to denounce the black armed resistance struggles. The reactionary ruling authorities also illegally arrested the chairman of the influential black organization "Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee," Brown, on the trumped-up charge of "inciting riots."

However, all this could not stop the awakening black people of America from rising up to fight against racial discrimination and for freedom and equal rights. The "Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee" publicly declared in a statement on the 26th regarding Brown's unjust arrest: "We are on the eve of the black revolution. ... (The recent) rebellions are merely a dress rehearsal for the real revolution."

    底特律市黑人狙击手机智勇敢四处活动打得敌人胆战心惊
    美国黑人紧握武器坚持武装抗暴
    据新华社二十七日讯　华盛顿消息：二十三日凌晨在底特律爆发的美国黑人斗争史上规模最大的一次武装抗暴斗争已经坚持了四昼夜。
    二十六日，三五成群的黑人狙击手（也有部分贫苦白人参加），活跃在底特律市各个地区，甚至不等天黑，就投入了战斗。他们沉着机智地从屋顶、从楼窗口、从烧焦了的断垣残壁后面，出其不意地向法西斯军警射出复仇的子弹，然后又很快地安全转移，打得敌人胆战心惊，疲于奔命。这天下午，狙击手们围攻一个区警察所达一个多小时，当场打伤了两名国民警卫队士兵和一名警官。在狙击手的沉重打击下，武装警察曾一度撤出市东南区的大片地区。州长罗姆尼惊呼，二十六日白天的狙击活动“比前几天更加厉害”。
    在底特律市黑人英勇斗争的鼓舞下，二十六日晚上又有十多个重要城市相继爆发了黑人暴力自卫斗争。在印第安纳州的南本德市，成群黑人青年接连两个晚上用石块、燃烧瓶狠狠回击警察的镇压。反动当局悍然在二十六日晚上宣布戒严，并出动一千名国民警卫队士兵加强镇压。在亚利桑那州的凤凰城，黑人群众根本不理睬宵禁的禁令，接连两个晚上涌上街头，用石块、玻璃瓶、自制燃烧瓶和狙击活动狠狠打击逞凶的警察。在纽约市繁华的市中心以及在旧金山、费城、俄亥俄州的辛辛那提、托列多和德顿、密执安州的大瀑布城等重要城市在二十六日也都先后爆发了规模不等的黑人斗争。
    面对着汹涌澎湃的黑人暴力自卫斗争浪潮，美国统治阶级如坐针毡，极为不安。约翰逊二十六日在白宫向美国青年发出“呼吁”，要他们“尊重法律”。美国统治集团在黑人中的臭名远扬的代理人马丁·路德·金等人，不惜抛弃伪装、赤膊上阵，公开发表声明，诋毁黑人的武力抗暴斗争。反动统治当局还以“煽动暴乱”的莫须有罪名非法逮捕了有影响的黑人组织“学生非暴力协调委员会”的主席布朗。
    但是这一切，都不能阻挡日益觉醒的美国黑人起来为反对种族歧视、争取自由和平等权利而斗争。“学生非暴力协调委员会”，二十六日就布朗无理被捕发表的声明公开宣告：“我们正处在黑人革命的前夜。……（最近的）这些造反行动只不过是为真正革命而进行的一次彩排。”
