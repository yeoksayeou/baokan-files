The revolutionary masses of the Commercial Bureau of Guiyang City held an open rectification meeting, first solving the problem of how to correctly treat oneself, thus resolving the differences among revolutionary mass organizations and achieving a revolutionary great alliance.

There are two revolutionary organizations in the bureau. One is called the "Commercial Bureau Revolutionary Rebel Corps," which was established earlier and has more members; the other is called the "Storm and Struggle Corps," which was established later and has fewer members. The two revolutionary organizations are consistent in their general direction, but there are many contradictions, and they have not been able to unite for a long time.

Should we unite with the "Storm and Struggle Corps" or not? The Eagle Fighting Group of the "Revolutionary Rebel Corps" conducted a class analysis of the "Storm and Struggle Corps" and believed that the general direction of the "Storm and Struggle Corps" has always been correct. Although they also have shortcomings and mistakes, they are basically issues of understanding. Therefore, they proposed to negotiate with the "Storm and Struggle Corps" to discuss ways to resolve contradictions. Other fighting groups of the "Revolutionary Rebel Corps" also participated in this negotiation meeting. The comrades of the "Storm and Struggle Corps" first examined their own shortcomings and mistakes and, at the same time, kindly offered some opinions to the "Revolutionary Rebel Corps." The comrades of the Eagle Fighting Group first offered opinions to their own leadership and then to the "Storm and Struggle Corps." Everyone sought common ground while reserving differences, and the atmosphere was harmonious. Some members of the "Revolutionary Rebel Corps" originally intended to use the "negotiation" as an opportunity to "attack" the "Storm and Struggle Corps," but after hearing the self-criticism of the "Storm and Struggle Corps," they gave up their original plan.

Seeing the effect of the first negotiation, most comrades of the "Revolutionary Rebel Corps" believed that sitting together to hold meetings and negotiate is a good way to eliminate the estrangement between revolutionary organizations. However, some comrades did not agree to negotiate, especially to conduct self-criticism during the negotiation. They believed that their organization enjoys a high reputation in the city, and self-criticism to the small organization like the "Storm and Struggle Corps" would affect their reputation.

Some comrades' disagreement with self-criticism actually reflects their lack of understanding of how to correctly treat oneself. Therefore, the "Revolutionary Rebel Corps" decided to hold an open rectification meeting, re-study the "Three Articles," and examine whether the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought is held high, whether the general direction is correct, whether the combat effectiveness is strong, and whether the alliance with friendly forces is good. The open rectification meeting was like a mirror and a bath for the "Revolutionary Rebel Corps." The Assault Horn Fighting Group, which originally disagreed the most with self-criticism, now realizes that how to correctly treat oneself is a matter of worldview. After the proletarian revolutionary faction seizes power, if they consider themselves heroes and stop progressing, bourgeois ideology will stage a comeback in their minds. Therefore, they should follow Chairman Mao's teachings, be "modest, prudent, and self-critical, and dare to correct mistakes in their work." They said: "In the past, we thought we were always right and others were always wrong. To strictly demand others, we must first strictly demand ourselves; to criticize others, we must first criticize ourselves. Only in this way can we avoid becoming more and more rigid." The leaders who were afraid that self-criticism would affect their reputation also said: "Reputation is given by the masses, not self-proclaimed. Those who are detached from the masses have never had reputation." They decided to carry out self-criticism with the spirit of "not fearing to lose the mountain."

At the same time, the "Storm and Struggle Corps" also held an open rectification meeting. During the rectification, both sides sent representatives to participate, and also invited masses who had been deceived into joining conservative organizations in the past to offer opinions.

Through the rectification, especially by conducting more self-criticism, the two organizations were able to sit together and talk, and the differences were resolved relatively smoothly. They truly united in thought and then established a unified organization—the Revolutionary Fighting Corps of the Commercial Bureau of Guiyang City under the Thought of Mao Zedong.

    严格要求自己才能正确对待同志
    贵阳市商业局革命群众组织消除隔阂实现革命大联合
    本报讯　贵阳市商业局无产阶级革命派开门整风，首先解决了如何正确对待自己的问题，从而解决了革命群众组织之间的分歧，实现了革命的大联合。
    这个局有两个革命组织，一个叫“商业局机关造反大队”，成立较早，人数也较多；一个叫“经风雨战斗队”，成立较晚，人数也较少。两个革命组织在大方向上是一致的，但是矛盾很多，迟迟联合不起来。
    到底要不要跟“经风雨”搞联合呢？“造反大队”的山鹰战斗组，对“经风雨”进行了阶级分析，认为，“经风雨”的大方向始终是正确的。他们虽然也有缺点和错误，但基本上是认识问题。于是倡议跟“经风雨”谈判，探讨解决矛盾的途径。“造反大队”的其他战斗组的一些同志也参加了这个谈判会。“经风雨”的同志首先检查了自己的缺点和错误，同时善意地向“造反大队”提出了一些意见。山鹰战斗组的同志先向自己的队委提意见，再给“经风雨”提意见。大家求大同，存小异，气氛很融洽。“造反大队”有些队员本来是想借“谈判”的机会，去“轰”“经风雨”几炮的，听了“经风雨”同志的自我批评，也就放弃了原来的打算。
    看到第一次谈判的效果，“造反大队”多数同志认为，坐在一起开会谈判是消除革命组织之间隔阂的一个好办法。但是，一部分同志不同意谈判，特别是不同意在谈判中进行自我批评。他们认为自己的组织在全市“享有崇高威信”，向“经风雨”这样的小组织作自我批评，威信会受到影响。
    部分同志不同意作自我批评，实际上是他们不懂得要正确地对待自己。因此，“造反大队”决定开门整风，重学“老三篇”，检查毛泽东思想红旗举得高不高，大方向对不对，战斗力强不强，联合友军好不好。开门整风给“造反大队”照了一次镜子，洗了一次澡。冲锋号战斗组原来最不同意作自我批评，现在也认识到怎样正确对待自己是一个世界观的问题。无产阶级革命派夺权以后，如果以功臣自居，停顿起来不求进步，资产阶级思想就要在头脑中复辟。因此，应该按照毛主席的教导，“谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，富于自我批评精神，勇于改正自己工作中的缺点和错误”。他们说：“过去认为自己都对，人家都不对。要严格要求别人，就得先严格要求自己；要批评别人，就得先批评自己。这样才不会越弄越僵。”那些怕作自我批评会影响威信的队委也说：“威信是群众给的，不是自封的。脱离群众，从来是没有威信的。”他们决定用“不怕丢山头的精神”开展自我批评。
    同时，“经风雨”也开门整风。在整风时，双方互派代表参加，还请过去因受蒙蔽参加过保守组织的群众参加，请他们提意见。
    经过整风，特别是多作自我批评，两个组织坐得拢，谈得来，比较顺利地解决了分歧，真正在思想上联合起来，接着就建立了统一的组织——毛泽东思想贵阳市商业局革命战斗大队。
