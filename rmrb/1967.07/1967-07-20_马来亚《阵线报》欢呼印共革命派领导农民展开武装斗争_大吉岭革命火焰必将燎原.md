	Malayan "Frontline News" Hails Indian Communist Revolutionary Faction Leading Peasants in Armed Struggle
	The Revolutionary Flame of Darjeeling Will Surely Spread

	New China News Agency, Singapore: The Malayan newspaper "Frontline News" published in Singapore on the 9th issued a commentary, enthusiastically hailing the armed peasants led by the revolutionary faction of the Indian Communist Party in establishing a red area in Darjeeling County, West Bengal. It pointed out that this is a spark of the Indian people's revolutionary armed struggle under the invincible guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, representing the current direction of the Indian revolutionary struggle.

	The commentary pointed out that the establishment of the armed struggle area in Darjeeling by the peasants is the revolutionary faction of the Indian Communist Party correctly grasping Chairman Mao's great revolutionary line on the revolutionary struggle in semi-colonial and semi-feudal societies, which must rely on the peasants to establish rural base areas, surround the cities from the countryside, and overthrow the reactionary rule through people's war to seize political power.

	The commentary said that the government of the Indian National Congress, representing the Indian big landlords and big bourgeoisie, has always ruthlessly oppressed and exploited the broad masses of laboring people, and has relied on American and British imperialism and Soviet revisionism, implementing a reactionary policy of hostility towards China, wildly anti-China and anti-Chinese. India has become a semi-colony of American imperialism. The Indian people, with no way out, are forced to rise up in rebellion, overthrow the Indian reactionary rule, which is the inevitable trend of Indian historical development. The Indian people have begun to realize today that only by using revolutionary violence to oppose counter-revolutionary violence, overthrowing the reactionary rule, and ultimately seizing political power is the only correct and feasible revolutionary path.

	The commentary went on to say that the appearance of the armed struggle of the peasants in Darjeeling, in this semi-colonial and semi-feudal country of India with a population of 500 million and uneven political and economic development, signifies that the Indian people's struggle against Indian reactionary rule, which has been developing in recent years, is entering a new stage. It means that a great people's revolution, with armed struggle as its main form, is definitely coming to India.

	The commentary concluded by saying that we are deeply convinced that the revolutionary torch lit by the peasants of Darjeeling is indestructible. It will surely become a raging inferno, thoroughly burying the Indian reactionaries and establishing a brand-new India.

    马来亚《阵线报》欢呼印共革命派领导农民展开武装斗争
    大吉岭革命火焰必将燎原
    新华社讯　新加坡消息：在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《阵线报》九日发表评论，热烈欢呼由印度共产党革命派领导的农民武装在印度西孟加拉邦大吉岭县建立红色地区。指出这是在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，印度人民开展革命武装斗争的星星之火，它代表了当前印度革命斗争的大方向。
    评论指出，大吉岭农民武装斗争地区的建立，是印度共产党革命派正确地掌握了毛主席关于半殖民地半封建社会革命斗争，必须依靠农民建立农村根据地，由农村包围城市，通过人民战争打倒反动统治，进而夺取政权的伟大革命方针。
    评论说，代表印度大地主大资产阶级的国大党政府，一贯对内残酷压迫和剥削广大劳动人民，对外投靠美英帝国主义和苏修，执行敌视中国猖狂地反华排华的反动政策。印度已沦为美帝的半殖民地。走投无路的印度人民，被迫起来造反，推翻印度反动统治，这是印度历史发展的必然趋势。印度人民今天开始觉悟到，只有以革命的暴力反对反革命的暴力，打倒反动统治，最终夺取政权才是唯一正确的、行得通的革命道路。
    评论接着说，大吉岭农民武装斗争，在印度这个具有五亿人口、政治经济发展不平衡的半殖民地、半封建大国的出现，标志着印度人民近年来日益发展的反抗印度反动统治的斗争，正在进入了一个崭新的阶段，它意味着在印度一场以武装斗争为主要形式的伟大的人民大革命一定要来临。
    评论最后说，我们深信，大吉岭农民已经燃起的革命火炬是扑不灭的，它必将形成燎原大火，彻底埋葬印度反动派，建立一个崭新的印度。
