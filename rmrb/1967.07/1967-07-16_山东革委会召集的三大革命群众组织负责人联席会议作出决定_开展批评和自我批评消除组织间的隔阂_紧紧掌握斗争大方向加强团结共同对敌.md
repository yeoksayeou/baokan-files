The Shandong Revolutionary Committee recently convened a joint meeting of the leadership of the Shandong Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Headquarters, the Shandong Red Guards Headquarters, and the Shandong Revolutionary Cultural Rebel Command. Through criticism and self-criticism, the meeting eliminated the isolation between the three major organizations, further strengthened unity, and jointly formulated a decision on further strengthening unity and jointly fighting against the enemy.

The Shandong Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Headquarters, the Shandong Red Guards Headquarters, and the Shandong Revolutionary Cultural Rebel Command have always been united in adversity and shared joys and sorrows in their stormy class struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. After seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Shandong Party, they have continued to fight side by side, win together, and unite together. However, in the new situation, due to the sabotage by class enemies and the infiltration of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideas such as individualism, factionalism, and cliquism into the revolutionary ranks, some leaders and grassroots organizations within the three revolutionary mass organizations have begun to harbor feelings of pride, self-congratulation, mutual disrespect, and even friction and mutual attacks among the organizations.

The Shandong Revolutionary Committee attaches great importance to this phenomenon that has begun to emerge within the three revolutionary mass organizations. They decided to immediately convene a joint meeting according to Chairman Mao's instructions to solve this problem.

The leaders of the three revolutionary mass organizations who participated in the joint meeting held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought from beginning to end. They solved the contradictions between them with the spirit of being strict with themselves and lenient with others, and mainly through self-criticism. In their speeches, they first focused on examining their own and their team's emerging erroneous thoughts such as "only I am revolutionary," "only I am leftist," pride, self-congratulation, factionalism, sectarianism, cliquism, and anarchism, and sincerely and strictly conducted self-criticism. For the harmful consequences and dangers caused by these erroneous thoughts in some places and units, they also took the initiative to assume responsibility. Following Chairman Mao's instruction to "start from the desire for unity, resolve contradictions through criticism or struggle, and thus achieve new unity on a new basis," the leaders of the three revolutionary mass organizations, with a warm feeling of loving revolutionary comrades, started from the desire for unity and carried out mutual criticism. In the criticism, they spoke openly, putting the problems on the table. They proceeded from the overall situation, adhering to the principle of seeking common ground while reserving differences, and many problems were satisfactorily resolved.

At the meeting, the leaders of the three revolutionary mass organizations all talked about the importance of further strengthening unity. Some said: Our three revolutionary mass organizations have branches all over the province. If we do not pay attention to solving the contradictions that have begun to emerge between us, it will inevitably affect the subordinate organizations and the entire province. Some said: The class enemies are doing everything they can to sabotage our unity and try to shift the direction of the struggle. We must not give the class enemies any opportunity to do what hurts our friends and pleases our enemies. Some said: We proletarian revolutionaries must always see the heavy revolutionary tasks on our shoulders, whether from the international or domestic struggle tasks, we have every reason to strengthen unity and no reason to expand contradictions. They unanimously believed that in the new situation where the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines is still very intense, we must follow Chairman Mao's instruction to "unify the country, unite the people, and unite the various nationalities within the country. This is the basic guarantee for the success of our cause," actively solve contradictions, strengthen unity, and make the three revolutionary mass organizations unite as one organization to severely strike the most important and dangerous enemy.

The leaders of the three revolutionary mass organizations also unanimously agreed in their speeches that in the future, to better strengthen unity, we must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to actively fight against various non-proletarian thoughts in our minds. Both treat ourselves as a force for the revolution and as an object of the revolution, insist on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and work hard on the "use" aspect, break private interests and establish public interests, and reform our worldview. Resolutely overcome factionalism, sectarianism, individualism, cliquism, anarchism, and various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts and non-proletarian thoughts, improve revolutionary spirit, scientific spirit, and organizational discipline. Resolutely implement Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, resolutely carry out the instructions of the Central Committee, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, correctly handle the contradictions between revolutionary mass organizations, strengthen the unity between revolutionary mass organizations, enhance revolutionary fighting capacity, and make new and greater contributions to the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

At the joint meeting, everyone put forward many beneficial suggestions on how to eliminate isolation, strengthen unity, and jointly fight against the enemy. Based on these suggestions, the "Decision on Further Strengthening Unity and Jointly Fighting Against the Enemy by the Shandong Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Headquarters, the Shandong Red Guards Headquarters, and the Shandong Revolutionary Cultural Rebel Command" was formulated. The leaders of the three revolutionary mass organizations unanimously expressed that they would educate their subordinate organizations to seriously implement the spirit of this joint meeting and the ten decisions, and make new and greater contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shandong Province.

    山东革委会召集的三大革命群众组织负责人联席会议作出决定
    开展批评和自我批评消除组织间的隔阂
    紧紧掌握斗争大方向加强团结共同对敌
    新华社济南十五日电　山东省革命委员会最近召集山东革命工人造反总指挥部、红卫兵山东指挥部、红卫兵山东文艺革命造反司令部三大革命群众组织的总部负责人举行联席会议，通过批评和自我批评，消除三大组织之间的隔阂，进一步加强了团结，并且共同制订了关于进一步加强团结共同对敌的决定。
    山东革命工人造反总指挥部、红卫兵山东指挥部、红卫兵山东文艺革命造反司令部三大革命群众组织，在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行急风暴雨般的阶级搏斗中，一直是同患难，共甘苦，互相支援，互相帮助，互相学习，结下了深厚的战斗友谊。在向山东省党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权后，他们也一直并肩战斗，团结在一起，胜利在一起。但是，在新的形势下，由于阶级敌人的破坏，以及个人主义、山头主义、小团体主义等各种资产阶级和小资产阶级思想对革命队伍的侵蚀，在三大革命群众组织中，一部分领导人和一部分基层组织，开始滋长了骄傲自满，功臣自居，互不尊重的情绪，以至出现了各组织之间搞“磨擦”、互相攻击的苗头。
    山东省革命委员会对于三大革命群众组织中开始出现的这种现象十分重视，他们决定按照毛主席的教导，立即召开联席会议来解决这一问题。
    参加联席会议的三大革命群众组织负责人，自始到终高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，本着严以责己，宽以待人，以自我批评为主的精神来解决相互间存在着的矛盾。他们在发言中，都是首先着重检查自己和自己队伍中开始滋长的“唯我革命”、“唯我独左”、骄傲自满、功臣自居、山头主义、宗派主义、小团体主义、无政府主义等错误思想，并诚恳地、严格地进行自我批评。对于由这些错误思想在个别地方、个别单位引起的恶果和危害，也都主动地承担责任。遵照毛主席“从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争使矛盾得到解决，从而在新的基础上达到新的团结”的教导，三大革命群众组织负责人，满怀爱护革命战友的热情，从团结的愿望出发，互相开展了批评。批评中，他们开诚相见，把问题摆到桌面上。他们从全局出发，本着求大同，存小异的原则，使许多问题得到了圆满解决。　
    会上，三大革命群众组织的负责人都谈到了进一步加强团结的重要性。有的说：我们三大革命群众组织的下属组织，遍布全省。我们彼此间开始出现的一些矛盾，如不重视解决，势必要涉及到下属组织，影响全省。有的说：阶级敌人千方百计地破坏我们的团结，企图转移斗争大方向，我们决不能给阶级敌人以可乘之机，做出亲者痛仇者快的事来。有的说：我们无产阶级革命派，随时随地都要看到自己肩上的革命任务是多么重，不论从国际还是国内的斗争任务来要求，都只有理由加强团结，没有理由扩大矛盾。他们一致认为，在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争仍然极为激烈的新形势下，必须遵照毛主席“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证”的教导，积极地解决矛盾，增强团结，使三大革命群众组织团结得象一个组织一样，狠狠地打击一小撮最主要最危险的敌人。
    三大革命群众组织领导成员在发言中，还一致认为，今后要更好地加强团结，必须更好地活学活用毛主席著作，以毛泽东思想为武器，对头脑中各种非无产阶级思想展开积极的斗争。既把自己当做革命的一份力量，又把自己当做革命的对象，坚持活学活用毛主席著作，并在“用”字上狠下功夫，破“私”立“公”，改造世界观。坚决克服山头主义、宗派主义、个人主义、小团体主义、无政府主义等资产阶级、小资产阶级思想和各种非无产阶级思想，提高革命性、科学性、组织纪律性。坚决贯彻毛主席的革命路线，坚决执行中央的指示，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，正确处理革命群众组织之间的矛盾，加强革命群众组织之间的团结，增强革命的战斗力，为无产阶级文化大革命取得彻底胜利，做出新的更大的贡献。
    联席会上，大家对如何消除隔阂，加强团结，共同对敌，提出了许多有益的建议。并根据这些建议，制定了《山东革命工人造反总指挥部、红卫兵山东指挥部、红卫兵山东文艺革命造反司令部关于进一步加强团结共同对敌的决定》。三大革命群众组织负责人一致表示，要认真教育自己的下属组织，坚决贯彻这次联席会议精神和十项决定，为山东省的无产阶级文化大革命作出新的更大的贡献。
