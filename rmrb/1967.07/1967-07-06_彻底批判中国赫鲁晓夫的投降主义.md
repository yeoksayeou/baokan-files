The vast army of the proletarian cultural revolution, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, is vigorously carrying forward the spirit of relentless pursuit and fierce attack, raising high the banner of revolutionary criticism, and concentrating firepower on the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party!

This biggest capitalist-roader in the Party has, for decades, consistently opposed the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, adhering to the lines of class surrenderism and national surrenderism, dreaming of pulling China onto the capitalist road. He is no "old revolutionary." He has always been a representative of the bourgeoisie within the Party, a thorough and unmitigated Khrushchev of China. This time, exposing him to the light of day, tearing off his mask, and revealing his ugly soul is a great victory of the proletarian cultural revolution! It is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

Who Should Lead the Chinese Revolution?

Who should lead the Chinese revolution? Should the proletariat seize the leadership in the struggle for power? This is a major issue concerning the fate of the revolution and the destiny of the nation. Chairman Mao has pointed out with precision: "Should the proletariat follow the bourgeoisie, or should the bourgeoisie follow the proletariat? This question of leadership in the Chinese revolution is the key to the success or failure of the revolution. 'We must sharply raise the question of who leads whom, and we must resolutely oppose surrenderism.' On the question of who leads whom, the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the line of class surrenderism of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party have engaged in a long and sharp struggle.

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party is an old-time class surrenderist. As early as the period of the First Revolutionary Civil War, when the struggle between the bourgeoisie and the proletariat for the leadership of the revolution was intensifying, he jumped out to oppose the working class leading the revolutionary masses to seize power, shouting that the Chinese proletariat was "immature" and "could not immediately" carry out the seizure of power. In March 1926, Chairman Mao published the brilliant work "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," solving the primary problem of the revolution: who are our enemies and who are our friends. However, six months later, this Khrushchev of China openly opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, advocating that the Kuomintang was the party bearing the leadership of the Chinese revolution.

His reactionary views were a complete replica of the surrenderist theory of the right-opportunist Chen Duxiu. At that time, wasn't Chen Duxiu vigorously slandering the Chinese proletariat as "not an independent revolutionary force," as being "very immature both in quantity and quality"? Wasn't he vigorously advocating that the "powerful" bourgeoisie should "lead the revolution"? The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party has been a faithful executor of Chen Duxiu's right-opportunist line from the very beginning.

It must be pointed out that the reactionary views of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party were in close harmony with the reactionary views of Dai Jitao that appeared at the time. The right-wing counter-revolutionary "theorist" Dai Jitao of the Kuomintang, around 1925, vigorously opposed the working class, advocating the establishment of a political system under the leadership of the Kuomintang, developing capitalism. Dai Jitao's counter-revolutionary propaganda was a ferocious attack by the reactionary bourgeoisie on the Chinese proletariat and its party, aiming to prepare public opinion for Chiang Kai-shek's counter-revolutionary military coup. The reactionary views propagated by the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party at that time were precisely in line with Dai Jitao's counter-revolutionary attack from within the Party.

In 1942, two years after Chairman Mao published another brilliant work, "On New Democracy," answering the nation's attention to the great question of "Where is China going?", the Khrushchev of China again opposed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, stubbornly adhering to his line of surrenderism. He advocated that the "Three Principles of the People" Kuomintang was a flag with great significance, that this flag "has a great relationship with the Chinese revolution," and that "I think the Chinese revolution can be carried out under the flag of the Kuomintang and the Three Principles of the People, at least for the democratic revolution, it would be much smoother than using other flags." He sang praises to the enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, saying that Chiang was also a flag, that "the entire Chinese nation has persisted in the war of resistance until the final victory, and Chiang has merit," and that "we must also acknowledge that Chiang is the leader of the construction of New China," and so on. In short, in his view, the proletariat could not lead the Chinese revolution, and the leadership of the revolution could only be handed over to the bourgeoisie, to the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek; without the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek's flag, the Chinese revolution would be at a standstill. This is a thorough traitor's theory.

This traitor's theory is the revival of Chen Duxiu's surrenderist line during the First Revolutionary Civil War and the development of the new surrenderist line led by Wang Ming during the War of Resistance Against Japan. Wang Ming's new surrenderist line fiercely opposed the leadership of the proletariat and the Communist Party over the War of Resistance Against Japan, advocating that the Kuomintang was the "greatest party fighting for the national survival of the Chinese people," and that Chiang Kai-shek was the "leader of the Chinese nation's anti-Japanese national construction." Yet, at the time when these class surrenderists were vigorously praising the Kuomintang, the enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, launched three waves of anti-communist campaigns. Along with military attacks, he also hired a small group of reactionary politicians, mystics, and Trotskyites to launch a ferocious attack on political and ideological fronts. These demons and monsters played the old fascist tune, shouting that "one ideology," "one party," "one leader," "communism is not suitable for China's national conditions," "the Communist Party has no place in China," and so on. If we compare the counter-revolutionary theory advocated by the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party with the anti-communist propaganda of the Kuomintang, Chiang Kai-shek, and their hired pen-pushers, we can see that at the time when the anti-communist tide was raging, they were in perfect harmony!

From this, it can be seen that on the question of the leadership of the revolution, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party is a direct descendant of the Chen Duxiu line and the Wang Ming line, consistently advocating the surrender of the leadership of the revolution to the bourgeoisie and the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek. Can the leadership of the Chinese revolution be handed over to the bourgeoisie? No! Absolutely not! We know that the Chinese bourgeoisie, due to its selfishness and lack of political and economic independence in semi-feudal and semi-colonial China, cannot lead the Chinese revolution. In the era of imperialism, if the Chinese revolution is led by the bourgeoisie, there will be no other way out except to turn China into a colony.

The Kuomintang, controlled by the running dog of imperialism and the enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, is a thorough and unmitigated counter-revolutionary party. They are dictatorial, sell out the country, fiercely anti-communist and anti-people, and carry out a complete set of fascism. If we follow the counter-revolutionary views of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, handing over the leadership of the revolution to the bourgeoisie and the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek, that would be a thorough betrayal of the revolution, dooming the future of the Chinese revolution.

Chairman Mao has long taught us: "The industrial proletariat is the leading force of our revolution." History has proven that the leadership of the Chinese revolution must and can only belong to the proletariat. Without the leadership of the Communist Party of China, no revolution can succeed. The Communist Party of China is the true flag of the Chinese revolution, and only it can open up the road to victory for the revolution.

Is It Armed Struggle or the "Parliamentary Road"?

Should the Chinese revolution take the road of armed struggle or the "parliamentary road"? This is an important aspect of the sharp struggle between the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao and the line of surrenderism of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." "The central task and highest form of the revolution is the armed seizure of power, solving problems through war." "The main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution is armed struggle." "The problem of China cannot be solved without arms."

However, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party has consistently opposed armed struggle, advocating legal struggle, and vigorously promoting the bankrupt "parliamentary road" of the Second International. In early 1946, he advocated that "the main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution has changed to peaceful, parliamentary struggle, and the struggle is legal mass struggle and parliamentary struggle." "The entire work of the Party must be transformed, and all our organizations must change, transforming from armed struggle to non-armed struggle as the main form, to adapt to the new situation." "In Beijing and Tianjin, our guns have not yet entered, but if parliamentary struggle is done well, we can enter with ballots." Here, he openly expressed his intention to replace revolutionary armed struggle with legal struggle, to replace the dictatorship of the proletariat with the "parliamentary road," dreaming of solving all political problems through parliamentary struggle. Obviously, he, like all revisionists, has been afflicted with the incurable disease of "parliamentary illusion." This disease fills him with a "solemn" belief: that the future and destiny of the entire China should be decided by old-time surrenderists like him, using the majority vote.

The so-called "parliamentary road" has long been thoroughly criticized by Lenin and has become a piece of junk in the outdated arsenal of revisionism. Lenin pointed out: "If the class struggle is limited to parliamentary struggle, or if parliamentary struggle is considered the highest, decisive, and controlling form of struggle, then this is actually a turn to the bourgeois side against the proletariat." The myth of "ballots" replacing guns spread by the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party has long been severely refuted by Lenin. Lenin said: "Only a scoundrel or a fool would think that the proletariat should first obtain a majority through the voting method under the oppression of the bourgeoisie and wage slavery, and then seize power. This is the height of stupidity or the height of hypocrisy, replacing class struggle and revolution with voting under the old system and old power."

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party has inherited the mantle of the Second International revisionism, attempting to make the Chinese revolution repeat the fate of the Second International revisionists, turning the Chinese Party into a parliamentary party, a puppet of Chiang Kai-shek, and a tool for maintaining bourgeois dictatorship. How poisonous his intentions are!

To realize his dream of the "parliamentary road," the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party also vigorously advocated surrendering the Party's military power and handing over the people's guns. In October 1937, when the war of aggression by Japanese imperialism was raging in North China and the country was at a critical moment of life and death, he actually advocated that all armed forces in North China should form a united army "under the leadership of the Central Military Commission of the National Government." In February 1938, he again advocated that guerrilla warfare in various regions "must implement the unified strategic will of the Central Military Commission in terms of strategy, and must implement the unified anti-Japanese policy of the Central Government in terms of policy." All anti-Japanese armed forces in North China "must be unified as much as possible under the direct command of the highest military command organs at the local, North China, and central levels, and implement the policies prescribed by the highest political organs in North China and the Central Government. Military commanders at all levels should be appointed or approved by higher authorities as much as possible." In short, the people's armed forces should be handed over to the Kuomintang, the command should be handed over to the Kuomintang, and the democratic government should also be handed over to the Kuomintang. Everything must follow Chiang Kai-shek and Yan Xishan, acting according to their facial expressions, without any independence or autonomy, not daring to say half a "no." This is a thorough and unmitigated line of class surrenderism.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people." "Communist Party members do not fight for personal military power, but they must fight for the Party's military power, for the people's military power." "The people's arms, a gun, a bullet, must be preserved and cannot be handed over."

The Chinese people, through long-term class struggle practice, have understood a truth: the enemy holds guns, and the revolutionary people must also take up guns. Without guns, the revolution cannot be victorious, and the people will suffer; with guns, there is the strength to ultimately and thoroughly defeat those class enemies and national enemies who are armed to the teeth. The experience of domestic struggle is like this, and the experience of international struggle is also like this.

After World War II, the French and Italian Communist Parties, under the leadership of the revisionist line, handed over their arms and participated in parliamentary elections, resulting in the loss of the fruits of struggle won by the working people, which is a painful lesson. In contrast, the heroic Vietnamese people, after World War II, because they held arms, not only drove out French imperialism but also defeated American imperialism, which is a precious experience. All these experiences and lessons prove: the army is the lifeblood of revolutionary forces, having an army means having power, and revolutionary war solves everything. Without the gun, there is no position for the proletariat and the Communist Party, and no problem can be solved. This is the revolutionary truth won by countless martyrs with their blood over the decades.

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party vigorously advocated handing over the people's guns to the Kuomintang, making the Chinese people lose the main tool for seizing power, consolidating power, and defending the dictatorship of the proletariat, unable to achieve the final victory of the revolution, unable to implement the dictatorship of the proletariat, and unable to realize socialism. This is a serious plot to sabotage the revolution, and the Chinese revolutionary people will never agree to it and must severely criticize and thoroughly settle accounts with this criminal activity!

Is It Resolute Struggle or National Betrayal?

Class surrenderism that adapts to the interests of the bourgeoisie at home will inevitably develop into national surrenderism that adapts to the interests of imperialism abroad. Chairman Mao teaches us: "National struggle, after all, is a class struggle problem." "In the War of Resistance Against Japan, class surrenderism is actually the reserve force of national surrenderism." The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party is exactly like this. While he has been actively promoting the line of class surrenderism, he has also vigorously promoted the line of national surrenderism.

The proletarian revolutionary line has always regarded imperialism and all reactionaries as paper tigers, whose nature will not change. They make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they perish—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries. In the face of beasts, not an ounce of cowardice should be shown. Revolutionary people must not only abandon illusions and prepare for struggle but must also confront them head-on, dare to struggle, and dare to win.

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, however, is the opposite. In the face of imperialist aggression, he is terrified, not daring to touch a hair of the enemy. As early as the period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he spread the fear of imperialism within the Party, openly saying that the "Japanese invaders still have great strength" and that "Japanese imperialism is not a paper tiger." In October 1937, he defended traitors, saying that they were "forced to surrender under the pressure of the Japanese invaders" and that even those forced by the Japanese invaders to perform labor and guard duties "should not be called traitors and punished uniformly. Because of the oppression of the Japanese invaders, sometimes the people have to report the actions of the guerrilla forces to the Japanese, and the guerrilla forces should understand the difficulties of the people and not make things difficult for them." In February 1938, he again declared: The joining of traitors in the maintenance associations is "forced" and is "for the protection of their lives and property," and they should not be punished uniformly.

It is no coincidence that when he was vigorously advocating national betrayal, the Kuomintang and Chiang Kai-shek's so-called "preservation of strength" and "indirect salvation" fallacies were also rampant in various places, providing "theoretical basis" for the Kuomintang's shameful situation of "traitor officials as numerous as hair" and "traitor generals as numerous as waves." The reactionary leader of the Kuomintang in North China, Zhang Yinyu, openly and shamelessly said: The great traitor Wang Jingwei was not betraying the country but was "indirectly saving the country"; the betrayal of the traitor Cai Enbo in North China was "to preserve strength and carry out the strategy of indirect salvation, although he betrayed the enemy in name, he was actually still working for our party to resist and build." Look at this "theory of indirect salvation" compared with the philosophy of life and surrender philosophy of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, how similar they are!

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Do not view the serious phenomena of surrender, anti-communism, and retreat that occur in various places in isolation. These phenomena should be recognized for their seriousness, should be resolutely resisted, and should not be overwhelmed by their power." The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, however, did the opposite, vigorously peddling the philosophy of traitors, attempting to induce the Chinese people to take the road of national betrayal. In his view, what proletarian revolutionary spirit, what national spirit, these are all unimportant, only "my" life is the most important. As long as one can preserve one's life, one can betray the country.

Chairman Mao sharply pointed out: Those who stubbornly walk the capitalist road "are actually preparing to surrender to imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism." The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party is such a person. To realize his dream of developing capitalism, he is willing to become a lackey of imperialism. In 1946, just after the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he eagerly declared: "The Americans must find compradors in China, and we can also serve as compradors, red compradors!" Compradors are running dogs of imperialism, where is the difference between "red" and "black"? The world's imperialist compradors are all the same, all are the appendages of imperialist monopoly capital in colonies, all are vampires of the people. In semi-feudal, semi-colonial old China, there could only be compradors like Chiang, Song, Kong, and Chen, and the compradors that imperialism wanted to find in China could only be running dogs like Chiang, Song, Kong, and Chen. These running dogs, under the control of imperialism, could only achieve one "accomplishment": making the national economy decline, causing currency inflation, skyrocketing prices, and plunging the working people into a sea of misery.

After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party "resolved" to align with the four major families of Chiang, Song, Kong, and Chen, willingly becoming their successors, serving as compradors for the Americans. This fact fully exposed his true face of national betrayal.

This old-time surrenderist placed all his hopes on the number one enemy of the Chinese people, American imperialism, begging for the "sympathy" and "help" of imperialism. In early 1946, he openly advocated that American and British imperialism "assist the Chinese democratic movement," making "the three major parties in China (Kuomintang, Communist Party, Democratic League) cooperate," and "the three major classes (working people, middle bourgeoisie, big bourgeoisie) cooperate," to achieve "democratization of China." He even shamelessly begged for alms from the pocket of American imperialism, saying, "If the Political Consultative Conference is successful, we participate in the government, and the twenty million US dollars borrowed from the United States will come, demobilization and rehabilitation, and some for the army... the rest to open factories..." He distorted history, confused black and white, turning the most vicious enemy of the Chinese people into the number one friend, turning the crazy aggression and plunder of American imperialism into "sympathy" and "assistance," and even expressing "gratitude." What is this if not naked nationalism!

The Chinese people have experienced more than a hundred years of American imperialism's so-called "sympathy" and "assistance." Since the Opium War of 1840, when imperialism invaded China, forcing China to grant extraterritorial rights, using religion, culture, and "charity" to carry out spiritual invasion, until the final imperialist war of aggression where the United States provided money and guns and Chiang Kai-shek provided people to fight for the United States against the Chinese people, all political, economic, military, and cultural invasions and oppression are the "sympathy" and "assistance" that American imperialism bestowed upon the Chinese people. Chairman Mao said, turning aggression into "friendship" is the logic of the American boss. This logic is not at all strange to its inventor, Acheson, but it is strange that this self-proclaimed "old revolutionary" "great figure" Khrushchev of China should be so enthusiastic and energetic in promoting this American logic within the Communist Party of China.

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party dreamed of relying on "American aid" to open factories to develop capitalism, which is purely a reactionary dream. The entire modern history of China is the history of imperialist aggression against China, opposing China's independence, and opposing China's development of capitalism. Imperialism is dying capitalism. Without colonies and semi-colonies, it cannot survive for a day. Under such conditions, will it allow any colony or semi-colony to establish a capitalist society under bourgeois dictatorship? The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, under the conditions of the imperialist era, dreamed of taking the capitalist road, the result of which would inevitably be to turn China into a colony of imperialism.

From the above series of issues, it can be seen that over the decades, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, on every major issue of the Chinese revolution, at every critical juncture of the revolution, has directly betrayed Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, betrayed the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, and betrayed the entire cause of the proletarian revolution. He, like Khrushchev and Tito, is a great traitor to the proletariat, a great traitor to the nation. If such a time bomb planted by imperialism and the bourgeoisie within our Party is not thoroughly removed and allowed to grow naturally, "then it will not take much time, a few years or a dozen years at the least, a few dozen years at the most, to inevitably bring about a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. The Marxist-Leninist Party will definitely become a revisionist party, become a fascist party, and the entire China will change color."

Down with the Khrushchev of China! Down with surrenderism!

　　彻底批判中国赫鲁晓夫的投降主义
　　程理嘉
    浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军，在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的指引下，正在发扬穷追猛打的精神，高举革命的批判旗帜，集中火力向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火！
    这个党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，几十年来一贯对抗以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，坚持阶级投降主义和民族投降主义路线，梦想把中国拉上资本主义的道路。他哪里是什么“老革命”？他从来就是一个资产阶级在党内的代理人，一个不折不扣的中国的赫鲁晓夫。这次把他揪到光天化日之下示众，撕下他的假面具，挖出他的丑恶的灵魂，是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利！是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    中国革命究竟由谁来领导？
    中国革命究竟由谁来领导？无产阶级在夺取政权的斗争中，要不要掌握领导权？这是关系到革命前途和国家命运的大是大非问题。毛主席一针见血地指出：“使无产阶级跟随资产阶级呢，还是使资产阶级跟随无产阶级呢？这个中国革命领导责任的问题，乃是革命成败的关键。”“必须尖锐地提出谁领导谁的问题，必须坚决地反对投降主义。”在谁领导谁的问题上，以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的阶级投降主义路线，曾经进行了长期的尖锐的斗争。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派是一个老牌的阶级投降主义者。早在第一次国内革命战争时期，资产阶级同无产阶级争夺革命领导权的斗争日益紧张的时候，他就跳出来反对工人阶级领导革命群众去夺取政权，大叫什么中国无产阶级“幼稚”，“说不上马上”去“实行夺取政权”。一九二六年三月，毛主席发表光辉著作《中国社会各阶级的分析》，提出并解决了谁是我们的敌人，谁是我们的朋友这个革命的首要问题。但是，六个月之后，这个中国的赫鲁晓夫公然同毛主席的革命路线大唱反调，大肆宣扬国民党是担负中国革命领导力量的政党。
    他的这种反动主张完全是右倾机会主义分子陈独秀的投降主义理论的翻版。陈独秀当时不是极力污蔑中国无产阶级“不是独立的革命势力”，“不但在数量上是很幼稚，而且在质量上也很幼稚”吗？不是大肆鼓吹让“力量雄厚”的资产阶级“统率革命”吗？党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，从一开始就成为陈独秀右倾机会主义路线的忠实执行者。
    必须指出的是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派这种反动的主张，同当时出现的反动的戴季陶主义也是紧密呼应的。国民党右派反革命“理论家”戴季陶在一九二五年前后极力反对工人阶级，主张在国民党的领导下，建立资产阶级统治的政治制度，发展资本主义。戴季陶进行的这种反革命宣传是反动资产阶级对中国无产阶级及其政党的猖狂进攻，其目的是为蒋介石的反革命军事政变作舆论上的准备。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派当时所宣传的这一套反动主张，正是从党内配合了戴季陶的这种反革命的进攻。
    一九四二年，也就是毛主席发表另一篇光辉著作《新民主主义论》，回答了举国瞩目的“中国向何处去”这样重大的问题之后的两年，中国的赫鲁晓夫又同毛主席的革命路线相对抗，继续顽固地坚持他的投降主义路线。他鼓吹什么“三民主义国民党是一面具有大作用的旗帜”，“这面旗帜”“对于中国革命有极大的关系”，“我以为中国革命能在国民党、三民主义这面旗帜下进行，至少是民主革命这一段，要比用其它的旗帜顺利得多”。他对人民公敌蒋介石大唱赞歌，说蒋“也同样是旗帜”，“中国全民族一直坚持抗战以至于最后胜利，蒋是有功的”，“我们也得承认蒋是新中国建设的领导者”，等等。总之，照他看来，无产阶级不能领导中国革命，革命的领导权只能归于资产阶级，归于国民党和蒋介石；离开了国民党、蒋介石这面“旗帜”，中国革命就寸步难行。——这是十足的叛徒理论。
    这种叛徒理论是第一次国内革命战争时期陈独秀的投降主义路线的复活，也是抗日战争中以王明为首的党内新投降主义路线的发展。王明的新投降主义路线疯狂地反对无产阶级及其先锋队共产党对抗日战争的领导权，鼓吹国民党是“为中国人民的民族生存而奋斗的最大政党”，蒋介石是“中华民族抗日建国的领袖”。可是，就在这些阶级投降主义者大肆吹捧国民党的时候，人民公敌蒋介石连续发动了三次反共高潮。在军事进攻的同时，他又雇用一小撮反动政客、玄学鬼和托洛茨基分子在政治思想上发动猖狂进攻。这些牛鬼蛇神大弹法西斯老调，叫喊什么“一个主义”、“一个政党”、“一个领袖”，“共产主义不适合中国国情”，“共产党在中国没有存在的必要”，等等。如果将党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所宣扬的那一套反革命理论，同国民党、蒋介石及其御用文人的反共宣传对照起来，可以看出，在当时反共声浪甚嚣尘上的时候，他们之间一唱一和，调子是多么的合拍！
    由此可见，在革命领导权问题上，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派同陈独秀路线、王明路线是一脉相承的，他一贯主张将革命领导权奉送给资产阶级和国民党蒋介石。中国革命的领导权能交给资产阶级吗？不能！绝对不能！我们知道，中国资产阶级由于处于半封建半殖民地的中国，由于它的自私自利性和政治上经济上的缺乏独立性，不可能领导中国革命。在帝国主义时代由资产阶级领导中国革命，除了使中国变成殖民地以外，不会有别的出路。
    被帝国主义走狗、人民公敌蒋介石所掌握的国民党更是彻头彻尾的反革命政党，他们独裁、卖国，疯狂地反共、反人民，执行的完全是一套法西斯主义。如果按照党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反革命主张去做，将革命的领导权交给资产阶级和蒋介石国民党，那就是不折不扣的叛卖革命，断送中国的革命前途。
    毛主席早就教导我们：“工业无产阶级是我们革命的领导力量”。历史证明，中国革命的领导权必须而且只能是归于无产阶级。离开了中国共产党的领导，任何革命都不能成功。中国共产党是领导中国革命的真正旗帜，只有她才能为革命开辟胜利的航道。
    是武装斗争还是“议会道路”？
    中国革命究竟是走武装斗争的道路还是走“议会道路”？这是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线同党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的投降主义路线进行尖锐斗争的一个重要方面。
    毛主席教导我们：“枪杆子里面出政权”。“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题”。“中国革命斗争的主要形式是武装斗争”。“中国的问题离开武装就不能解决”。
    但是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却同无产阶级的革命路线针锋相对，一贯反对武装斗争，鼓吹合法斗争，极力推行第二国际的早已破了产的所谓“议会道路”。一九四六年初，他鼓吹“中国革命的主要斗争形式已变为和平的、议会的，斗争是合法的群众斗争和议会斗争”。“党的全部工作要实行转变，我们的一切组织要改变，转变到非武装斗争为主，以适应新形势”。“平津我们的枪杆子未打进去，要议会斗争弄得好，可以用选票进去”。这里，他十分露骨地表示要用合法斗争代替革命的武装斗争，要用“议会道路”代替无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政，幻想通过议会斗争去解决一切政治问题。显然，他已经和所有修正主义分子一样，害了修正主义“议会迷”的不治之症。这种病症使他充满了一个“庄严”的信念：即整个中国的前途和命运要由象他那样的老牌投降主义者当议员，用多数票来决定。
    所谓“议会道路”，早已被列宁所彻底批判，变成修正主义陈旧武库中的破烂货了。列宁指出：“如果把阶级斗争局限于议会斗争，或者认为议会斗争是最高的、决定性的、支配着其余一切斗争形式的斗争，那就是实际上转到资产阶级方面去而反对无产阶级。”①党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所散布的所谓“选票”能代替枪杆子的神话，列宁也早就作了严厉的驳斥。列宁说：“只有坏蛋或者傻瓜才会认为，无产阶级应当首先利用资产阶级压迫下和雇佣奴隶制压迫下进行的投票方式取得多数，然后才去夺取政权。这是绝顶的愚蠢或绝顶的虚伪，这是用旧制度旧政权下的投票来代替阶级斗争和革命。”②
    中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派继承了第二国际修正主义的衣钵，妄图使中国革命重蹈第二国际修正主义者的覆辙，使中国党变成议会党，变成蒋介石的附庸，堕落为维护资产阶级专政的工具，其用心何其毒也。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为了实现其“议会道路”的美梦，还极力主张出卖党的兵权，交出人民的枪杆子。一九三七年十月，正当日本帝国主义侵略的战火在华北蔓延，国家处于生死存亡的紧急关头，他竟然主张华北一切武装组成联军，“受国民政府中央军事委员会的领导”。一九三八年二月，他又主张各个地区的游击战“在战略上必须实行中央军事委员会统一的战略意志，在政策上必须实行中央政府统一的抗日政策”。华北的一切抗日武装部队“必须尽可能的统一在当地的、华北的以及中央的最高军事指挥机关的直接指挥之下，并且执行华北最高政治机关以及中央所规定的政策。各级军事指挥人员尽可能由上级委任或批准”。一句话，人民武装要交给国民党，指挥权要交给国民党，民主政权也要交给国民党，一切都得服从蒋介石和阎锡山，看他们的脸色行事，不能有一点独立自主，不能讲半个“不”字，这完全是一条彻头彻尾、彻里彻外的阶级投降主义路线。
    毛主席教导我们：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”。“共产党员不争个人的兵权，……但要争党的兵权，要争人民的兵权。”“人民的武装，一枝枪、一粒子弹，都要保存，不能交出去。”
    中国人民经过长期的阶级斗争实践，懂得了一条真理：敌人手里拿着枪杆子，革命人民也应当拿起枪杆子来。没有枪杆子，革命就不能胜利，人民就要遭殃；有了枪杆子，就有力量最后彻底地战胜那些武装到牙齿的阶级敌人和民族敌人。国内的斗争经验如此，国际上的斗争经验也是如此。
    第二次世界大战以后，法共、意共在修正主义路线领导下，交出了武装，参加议会选举，结果，丢尽了劳动人民斗争得来的胜利果实，不就是一个惨痛的教训吗？与此相反，战后英雄的越南人民，由于掌握了武装，不仅赶走了法帝国主义，而且打败了美帝国主义，不就是一个宝贵的经验吗？所有这些经验教训都证明：军队是革命力量的命根子，有军则有权，革命战争解决一切。离开了枪杆子，就没有无产阶级和共产党的地位，就什么问题也解决不了。这是几十年来无数先烈用鲜血换来的革命真理。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，大肆鼓吹将人民的枪杆子送给国民党，使中国人民失掉夺取政权、巩固政权和保卫无产阶级专政的主要工具，不能争取革命的最后胜利，不能实行无产阶级专政，不能实现社会主义。这是一件严重的破坏革命的罪恶阴谋，中国革命人民决不能答应，一定要对这种罪恶活动进行严厉的批判和彻底的清算！
    是坚决斗争还是卖国投降？
    在国内适应资产阶级利益需要的阶级投降主义，必然会发展到在国际上适应帝国主义利益需要的民族投降主义。毛主席教导我们：“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”“在抗日民族革命战争中，阶级投降主义实际上是民族投降主义的后备军。”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派就是这样，他在一贯积极推行阶级投降主义路线的同时，又大力推行民族投降主义路线。
    无产阶级的革命路线历来认为，帝国主义和一切反动派都是纸老虎，它们的本性是不会改变的，捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡，——这就是帝国主义和一切反动派的逻辑。在野兽面前，不可以表示丝毫的怯懦，革命的人民不仅要丢掉幻想，准备斗争，而且要针锋相对，敢于斗争，敢于胜利。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却截然相反，他在帝国主义的侵略面前，害怕得要死，不敢动敌人的一根毫毛。早在抗日战争时期，他就在党内宣扬恐帝思想，公然胡说什么“日寇还有很大力量”，
  “日本帝国主义不是一个纸老虎”。一九三七年十月，他为汉奸辩护，胡说什么，他们是“不得不在日寇强迫下而表示投降的，甚至被日寇强迫从事劳役与守望的，这些人均不得称为汉奸一律处办。因为日寇的压迫，有时人民还不得不向日人报告游击队的行动，游击队还应该谅解人民的苦衷，不使人民为难”。一九三八年二月，他又宣称：汉奸加入维持会是“强迫的”，是“为了保护身家性命”，不能一律处罚。
    真是无独有偶，正是在他大肆鼓吹卖国主义的时候，国民党、蒋介石的所谓“保存实力”、“曲线救国”等谬论也在各地盛行起来，为国民党的“降官如毛，降将如潮”的丑恶局面制造“理论根据”。华北国民党反动头子张荫梧公开无耻地说：大汉奸汪精卫不是卖国，而是“曲线救国”；华北汉奸柴恩波的叛变投敌，是“为了保存实力及实行曲线救国计，名虽投敌，实际仍为本党作抗建工作”。请看这段“曲线救国论”与党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的活命哲学、投降哲学相比，何其相似乃尔！
    毛主席指出：“不要把各地发生的投降、反共、倒退等严重现象孤立起来看。对于这些现象，应认识其严重性，应坚决反抗之，应不被这些现象的威力所压倒。”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却反其道而行之，大肆贩卖汉奸哲学，妄图诱使中国人民走上卖国投降的道路。在他看来，什么无产阶级的革命气节，什么民族气节，这些都是无关紧要的，只有“我”的性命才是最要紧的。只要能保命，就可以卖国。
    毛主席尖锐地指出：顽固地走资本主义道路的人，“实际上是准备投降帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的人”。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派就是这种人，他为了实现发展资本主义的幻想，不惜去充当帝国主义的奴才。一九四六年抗日战争刚刚胜利，他急不可耐地宣称：“美国人非要在中国找买办不可，我们也可以给他当买办，红色买办么！”买办就是帝国主义的走狗，哪里还有什么“红与黑”的分别？天下乌鸦一般黑。世界上帝国主义的买办一个样，都是帝国主义垄断资本在殖民地的附属物，都是人民的吸血鬼。在半封建、半殖民地的旧中国，只能有蒋、宋、孔、陈那样的官僚买办，帝国主义在中国要找的买办，也只能是蒋、宋、孔、陈那样的走狗。这些走狗在帝国主义的控制下，唯一能做出的“成绩”，就是使全国的经济凋敝，通货膨胀，物价飞涨，陷劳动人民于水深火热之中。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在抗日战争胜利以后，“立志”向蒋、宋、孔、陈四大家族看齐，甘愿充当他们的继承人，做美国人的买办，这个事实充分暴露了他的卖国投降的真面目。
    这个老牌的投降主义者把一切希望都寄托在中国人民的头号敌人美帝国主义身上，乞求帝国主义的“同情”和“帮助”。一九四六年初，他公然主张要美、英帝国主义“援助中国民主运动”，使“中国三个主要政党（国民党、共产党、民主同盟）合作”，“三个主要阶级（劳动人民、中等资产阶级、大资产阶级）合作”，实现“中国民主化”。他甚至无耻地向美帝国主义的钱袋乞求施舍，胡说“政协会成功，我们参加政府，美国借的二十万美金就来了，复员善后，整军用一点，其余要开工厂……。”他颠倒历史，混淆黑白，把中国人民最凶恶的敌人说成是头号朋友，把美帝国主义的疯狂侵略和掠夺说成是“同情”、“援助”，而且还要表示“感谢”，这不是赤裸裸的卖国主义又是什么！
    对于美帝国主义的所谓“同情”和“援助”，中国人民已经领教了一百多年了。自从一八四○年帝国主义侵略中国的鸦片战争起，强迫中国给予治外法权，利用宗教、文化、“慈善”事业进行精神侵略，直至最后由美国出钱出枪、蒋介石出人替美国打仗杀中国人的侵略战争，所有政治上、经济上、军事上、文化上的侵略和压迫，都是美帝国主义赐给中国人民的“同情”和“援助”。毛主席说，将侵略写成了“友谊”，是美国老爷的逻辑。这个逻辑对于它的发明人艾奇逊说来，是一点也不奇怪的，奇怪的是这个自称“老革命”的“大人物”中国的赫鲁晓夫，竟然在中国共产党内如此热心如此卖劲地推销这种美国逻辑。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派幻想依靠“美援”开工厂来发展资本主义，这纯粹是一枕反动的黄粱梦。整个中国的近代史，就是帝国主义侵略中国，反对中国独立，反对中国发展资本主义的历史。帝国主义是垂死的资本主义，离开了殖民地半殖民地，它就一天也活不下去，在这种情况下，难道还会容许任何殖民地半殖民地建立什么资产阶级专政的资本主义社会吗？党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在帝国主义时代的条件下，幻想走资本主义道路，其结果必然是使中国变成帝国主义的殖民地。
    从上述一系列的问题可以看出，几十年来，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在中国革命的每个重大问题上，在革命的每个紧要关头上，都直接背叛了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想，背叛了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，背叛了整个无产阶级的革命事业。他同赫鲁晓夫、铁托之流一样，是无产阶级的大叛徒，是民族的大叛徒。对于这样一个帝国主义和资产阶级埋在我们党内的定时炸弹，对于这样一个中国的赫鲁晓夫式的最大的修正主义者，如果不彻底挖掉，任其自然生长，“那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”
    打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫！打倒投降主义！
