Over ten million patriotic shop assistants, street vendors, and business owners in Hong Kong, forming a formidable anti-British and anti-violence commercial army, have successfully carried out a four-day joint strike, breaking through the British imperialists' plots and sabotage. They have struck a heavy blow to the British authorities, leaving them in disarray. Patriotic business owners have stated that this is just the first step in their anti-British and anti-violence actions, and they are ready to respond to the motherland's call, taking various effective measures to retaliate against British imperialism.

Starting from June 29, over ten million patriotic shop assistants, street vendors, and business owners participated in this action. Over 90% of pork wholesalers and meat companies joined the strike. Over 90% of vegetable and fruit agents and wholesale companies also participated in the strike. All 40-plus major egg distributors in Hong Kong fully participated in the strike. Over 70% of seafood businesses joined the strike as well.

Additionally, 40-plus large and small Chinese goods companies in Hong Kong and Kowloon, 20 branches and distribution stores of the Chinese Shoe Company, and 33 patriotic bookstores all joined the strike. Workers and business owners in the grain, oil, food, local products, herbs, textiles, crafts, building materials, and other industries also actively participated in the strike. Many wholesalers and retailers of foreign goods broke through various obstacles set by American and British imperialists and foreign capitalists, resolutely joining the just cause of the joint strike.

The street vendors of the five districts in Hong Kong, who had previously held a strike on June 13, this time united with tens of thousands of street vendors across Hong Kong and Kowloon, forming a mighty anti-violence strike force.

The broad masses of fishermen in Hong Kong firmly supported the just cause of the joint strike. During the four days of the strike, they boycotted the British fishing market.

The people of Macau also firmly supported the joint strike of the patriotic business community in Hong Kong. During the Hong Kong strike, they refused to transport chickens, ducks, and fish to Hong Kong.

Under the impact of the anti-British and anti-violence strike force, British imperialism appeared panicked and disorganized. After the strike declaration was issued, the director of the British "Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry Department" and the deputy director of the "Commerce Department" tried to act calm, boasting that "Hong Kong can handle the shortage of food." Before they finished speaking, an incident occurred where British "Agriculture, Fisheries, and Forestry Department" officials detained pigs and cattle sent from the mainland to Hong Kong. At that time, there were 17 train cars of pigs and cattle from the mainland waiting to be sent back to Shenzhen. British officials discovered this and deliberately caused trouble, attempting to detain them. They sent people to monitor the situation and immediately called for vehicles to transport them. When the British convoy arrived, these pigs and cattle had already been cleverly transported away by patriotic workers. The British officials returned empty-handed, appearing disheveled and disorganized. The British also sent large numbers of personnel to various districts in Hong Kong and Kowloon to search for vegetables, pork, and fresh fish to decorate the market. However, they could only manage to gather about 10% of the usual pork sales and 30-40% of the usual vegetable supply each day, with a large portion of the vegetables being forcibly cut seedlings.

To sabotage the strike, the British sent large numbers of commercial department personnel and police spies to threaten shops and street vendors. On the first day of the strike, the British police authorities telephoned a food shop in the Central District that was participating in the strike, demanding that they remove the strike notice from their door and reopen for business. The shop's employees immediately responded firmly, "We support the workers' strike and will not reopen!" British "officials" and spies also threatened business owners and street vendors with "revoking licenses" and "arrest," sending large numbers of "riot police" to patrol near the markets, and instructing British and American capitalists to use "demanding payment of debts" to force striking shops to continue operating. However, the broad masses of patriotic business workers in Hong Kong countered these sabotage attempts head-on. A butcher, facing the British police's threats, said resolutely, "We can die, we can shed blood, but we cannot abandon our national duty. For the sake of overthrowing the British, we fear nothing, let alone 'license revocation'!"

Hong Kong various circles today warmly praised the patriotic business owners for successfully carrying out a four-day anti-British and anti-violence strike.

On the morning of the 3rd, a group of patriotic students, holding up portraits of Chairman Mao and Mao's quotations, banging drums and gongs, joyfully went to the Daxia Chinese Goods Company in Hong Kong's Central District, cheering for the patriotic and just actions of the business owners. The students hung up many banners praising the 63 industries' successful joint strike and a large number of anti-British and anti-violence cartoons. They sang revolutionary songs and shouted slogans such as "Long live the great unity of Hong Kong and Kowloon patriots!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" and so on.

The Hong Kong Workers' Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee today issued a statement, warmly praising the just actions of the patriotic business owners. The statement said: The 63 patriotic business units, at the time when the working class's main force was advancing against the British fascist rule, stood up and held a four-day large-scale anti-British and anti-violence joint strike. This not only dealt a severe blow to British imperialism in politics and economy, strongly supporting the workers' strike in various industries, but also greatly encouraged the working class and patriots throughout Hong Kong.

The Hua Run Company, Wu Feng Row, De Xin Row, and Hua Yuan Company, and other patriotic business institutions also issued a joint statement, praising the just actions of the patriotic business community in Hong Kong and Kowloon. Many patriots also wrote letters to newspapers, expressing their most resolute support for the patriotic business owners' anti-British and anti-violence strike actions.

　　香港十多万工商业者胜利实现联合大罢市
　　有力地配合了工人大罢工　把港英当局打得狼狈不堪
　　香港各界同胞热烈赞扬爱国工商业者的正义行动
    新华社香港三日电 香港十多万爱国店员、小贩和工商业者组成的声势浩大的反英抗暴商业大军，冲破了港英帝国主义的阴谋破坏，胜利地实现了四天的联合大罢市，把港英当局打得狼狈不堪。爱国工商业者表示，这只是他们反英抗暴的第一步行动，他们随时准备响应祖国的号召，采取各种有效办法，加倍回击英帝国主义。
    从六月二十九日开始一连四天的联合大罢市，有十多万爱国店员、小贩和爱国工商业者投入这一行动。生猪批发商和肉食公司，百分之九十以上参加了罢市。蔬菜、水果代理商和批发商号，也有百分之九十参加大罢市。香港最主要的四十多家蛋品承销商号，全部参加罢市行动。经营鲜鱼业的商号，也有百分之七十以上参加罢市。
    此外，港九四十多家大小国货公司，中国皮鞋公司二十个门市部和分销店，三十三家爱国书店，也全部罢市。粮油、食品、土产山货、药材、纺织品、工艺品、建筑材料等行业的爱国职工和商人，也积极地参加了大罢市。许多经营外国商品的批发商和零售商，冲破了美英帝国主义和外国资本家的种种阻拦，毅然参加联合罢市的正义行动。
    曾经在六月十三日举行过罢市的香港区五行小贩，这次联合全港九的几万名小贩，组成了一支浩浩荡荡的抗暴罢市大军。
    香港广大渔民坚决支持联合大罢市的正义行动。他们在四天罢市期间，对港英渔市场实行了抵制。
    澳门同胞也坚决支持香港爱国工商界的大罢市。他们在香港罢市期间，拒运鸡、鸭、鱼等来香港。
    在反英抗暴罢市大军的冲击下，港英帝国主义显得惊慌失措。在罢市宣言发表后，港英的“农林渔政处”处长和“工商处”副处长，曾故作镇静地吹嘘“香港足可以应付副食品不足的局面”。这两个港英官员话音未了，就发生了一宗港英“农林渔政处”官员扣留从祖国运港的猪牛的丑剧。当时火车站上有十七车皮祖国运来的猪牛，等待退回深圳。港英官员发现后故意进行刁难，企图借机扣留下来。他们一面派人进行监视，一面立即叫汽车来搬运。等到港英的车队开到，这些猪牛早已被爱国工人机智地运走了。港英人员扑了一场空，显得狼狈不堪。港英还派出大批人员，到港九新界各地搜罗蔬菜、猪肉、鲜鱼来点缀市场。但是，他们每天千方百计也只能搜罗到占平常销量大约一成左右的猪肉，三、四成左右的蔬菜供给市场，蔬菜中有大量还是被强迫割下来的菜苗。
    港英为了破坏大罢市，曾派出大批商业部门的人员和警察特务，向商店和小贩进行恐吓。在罢市的第一天，港英警察当局就用电话“警告”中区一家参加罢市的食品商店，要他们马上除下门前张贴的罢市布告，并要他们开门营业。商店的职工当即坚决地回答：“我们支持工人大罢工，决不开市！”港英“官员”和特务，还到处以“吊销牌照”、“逮捕”等手段来威胁商人、小贩，又派出大批“防暴队”到市场附近来回巡逻，还指使英、美资本家以“迫交欠账”的手段，来要挟罢市商店继续营业。但是，香港广大的爱国商业工作者，针锋相对地击破港英破坏罢市的阴谋。一位售卖肉类的小贩在港英警察的恐吓面前，大义凛然地说：“头可断，血可流，民族大义不可丢，为了斗垮港英，我们什么都不怕，还怕‘抄牌’（吊销牌照）吗？”
    新华社香港三日电香港各界同胞今天热烈赞扬爱国工商业者胜利举行为期四天的反英抗暴大罢市。
    三日上午，一群爱国学生高举毛主席像和毛主席语录牌，敲锣打鼓，兴高采烈地到香港中区的大华国货公司，欢呼工商业者的爱国正义行动。学生们在国货公司门前，张贴了许多赞扬六十三个行业胜利进行联合大罢市的标语和大批反英抗暴漫画。他们高唱革命歌曲，高呼“港九爱国同胞大联合万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”等口号。
    香港各业工人反对港英迫害斗争委员会今天发表声明，热烈赞扬爱国工商业者的正义行动。声明说：六十三个单位的爱国工商业者，在工人阶级主力军向港英法西斯统治大进军的时候，挺身而出，举行了为期四天的声势浩大的反英抗暴联合大罢市，不仅在政治上和经济上给予港英帝国主义以严重的打击，有力地配合了各业工人的大罢工，而且是对全港工人阶级和爱国同胞的巨大鼓舞。
    华润公司、五丰行、德信行、华远公司等爱国商业机构也发表联合声明，赞扬港九爱国工商界的正义行动。许多爱国同胞还写信给报社，对爱国工商业者进行罢市的反英抗暴行动表示最坚决的支持。
