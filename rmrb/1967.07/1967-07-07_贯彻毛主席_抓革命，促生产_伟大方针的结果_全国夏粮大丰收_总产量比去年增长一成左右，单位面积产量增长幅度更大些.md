In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, joyous news of a bumper summer grain harvest has been spreading from south to north across our country's vast rural areas. According to investigations by relevant departments, the nationwide summer grain yield is approximately 10% higher than last year, with the yield per unit area increasing even more significantly, making this a year of great harvest. The billion-strong peasantry and rural revolutionary cadres enthusiastically acclaim: This is another great victory of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, and another fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are determined to forge ahead, riding the wind and breaking the waves, and continue the struggle to achieve a bumper harvest of autumn grains.

By late June, except for a few areas in the northwest, summer harvesting has either concluded or is basically concluded in both the south and the north. The situation in the areas that have already harvested indicates that, except for a few regions where the harvest was slightly affected by severe disasters, the overall yield is higher than last year, with many regions experiencing a bumper harvest unprecedented in many years. In the southwestern mountainous region, Guizhou Province's summer grain yield far exceeds that of any previous year. In the northern region, Shanxi Province's summer grain yield has significantly increased compared to last year, with the famous Dazhai Brigade achieving a doubling of its yield. Important summer grain-producing regions such as Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, Sichuan, Hubei, and the suburban areas of Shanghai have all seen significant increases in their summer grain yields.

This year, summer grain production in various parts of our country was carried out during the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. During the sowing period, some major summer grain-producing areas in the Huanghuai River basin experienced severe droughts, delaying the sowing period for some wheat fields; many other wheat fields suffered from drought, resulting in insufficient soil moisture. This posed significant challenges to the growth of summer grains. After spring, the drought in most parts of the Huanghuai River basin gradually eased, but some areas experienced hailstorms and pest infestations; in many areas north of the Yangtze River, in addition to hailstorms and pest infestations, there were also dry, hot winds that were unfavorable for the growth of summer grains. All these factors added to the difficulties in summer grain production. However, the broad masses of peasants and rural revolutionary cadres, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's great policy of "Grasp revolution, promote production," displayed an unyielding spirit of defying all difficulties. They channeled the surging revolutionary enthusiasm unleashed by the Cultural Revolution into the management of wheat fields and spring plowing, with the support of the People's Liberation Army in assisting rural cultural revolution and agricultural production. They bravely and unyieldingly fought against various difficulties. Especially after the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres seriously studied the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to All Poor and Lower-Middle Peasants and Cadres at All Levels in Rural People's Communes," they used Mao Zedong Thought to guide production, suppressed the evil wind of rightist opportunism, and agricultural production in various places surged, ultimately achieving double victories in both revolution and production.

Our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "In the realms of production struggle and scientific experiment, mankind is constantly developing, and nature is constantly developing, never stopping at a certain level. Therefore, mankind must constantly summarize experiences, make discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress."

Following Chairman Mao's teachings, the peasant masses and rural revolutionary cadres in various places, based on summarizing experiences, channeled the surging enthusiasm unleashed by the Cultural Revolution into the struggle to create conditions for increased production. Expanding irrigated land is a crucial condition for agricultural increase in drought-prone areas. Last winter and this spring, many regions vigorously carried out water conservancy projects, transforming dry land into irrigated land. The broad masses of peasants and rural revolutionary cadres in the north and south, based on summarizing experiences, also carried out many reforms in sowing methods, sowing tools, field management, and pest control, to varying degrees achieving "discoveries, inventions, creations, and progress."

After the summer grains ripened one after another, various places, following Chairman Mao's teachings of "Every year, we must tightly grasp the three tasks of harvesting, storing, and consuming (harvesting, storing, and consuming)," organized a powerful summer harvest labor force, using the great criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party as a driving force, firmly grasping the "harvesting, storing, and consuming" of summer grains, striving to achieve precise harvesting and threshing, ensuring every grain is stored, and timely arranging distribution and procurement work. Shanxi, Shandong, Guizhou, Sichuan, Beijing, and Shanghai provinces and municipalities organized large numbers of revolutionary workers, revolutionary students, revolutionary cadres, and PLA soldiers to go to the countryside, fighting shoulder to shoulder with the peasant masses and rural revolutionary cadres. Due to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution igniting the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad masses, coupled with the strong support from all sides, not only was the summer harvest pace significantly accelerated, but the summer harvest quality was also notably improved. The distribution and procurement of summer grains in many places were also better handled than in previous years.

The billion-strong peasant masses and broad rural revolutionary cadres in our country are extremely excited to believe that the nationwide bumper summer grain harvest this year is a victorious achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a result of implementing Chairman Mao's policy of "Grasp revolution, promote production," and another great victory of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of peasants and rural revolutionary cadres are determined to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, to grasp the revolution and vigorously promote production. While striving to complete the summer sowing tasks in a timely and high-quality manner, they will also strengthen the field management of autumn grains, determined to overcome various natural disasters and continue to strive for a bumper autumn grain harvest.

### 贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的结果　全国夏粮大丰收　总产量比去年增长一成左右，单位面积产量增长幅度更大些

　　贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的结果
　　全国夏粮大丰收
　　总产量比去年增长一成左右，单位面积产量增长幅度更大些
    据新华社六日讯　在无产阶级文化大革命取得节节胜利的凯歌声中，我国广大农村从南到北，频频传来夏粮作物丰收的喜讯。据有关部门调查，全国夏粮总产量约比去年增长一成左右，单位面积产量的增长幅度还更大一些，是一个大丰收年景。亿万农民群众和农村革命干部热烈欢呼：这是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利，这是无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果。他们决心乘风破浪，胜利前进，为夺取秋粮作物的大丰收而继续斗争。
    到六月下旬，除西北少部分地区外，南北各地夏收已经结束或基本结束。已收地区的情况表明，除个别地区因灾情较重收成稍差外，普遍比去年增产，其中不少地区是多年未有过的大丰收。西南山区的贵州省，夏粮的收成大大好于历史上任何一年。华北地区的山西省，夏粮总产量比去年有较大幅度的增长，著名的大寨大队更比去年成倍增产。重要夏粮产区的河南、河北、陕西、四川、湖北等省及上海市郊区，夏粮增产的幅度都较大。
    今年我国各地的夏粮生产，是在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中进行的。在播种期间，黄淮流域的一些主要夏粮产区，曾遭到严重干旱，使部分麦田推迟了播种期；另有不少麦田因旱造成底墒不足。这样，就对夏粮作物的生长带来了较大的困难。入春以后，黄淮流域大部分地区旱象逐渐缓和，但又有一部分地区发生雹灾和虫害；长江以北不少地区除有雹灾、虫害外，还出现了对夏粮生长不利的干热风。所有这些，都给夏粮生产增加了困难。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大农民群众和农村革命干部，在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针的指引下，高度发扬藐视一切困难的大无畏精神，把文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天革命干劲，用到麦田管理和春耕生产中去，在支援农村文化大革命和农业生产的中国人民解放军的帮助下，英勇不屈地向各种困难展开了顽强的斗争，特别是在广大贫下中农和革命干部认真学习了《中共中央给全国农村人民公社贫下中农和各级干部的信》以后，用毛泽东思想统帅生产，煞住了反革命经济主义妖风，各地农业生产更出现了高潮，终于夺取了革命、生产的双胜利。
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“在生产斗争和科学实验范围内，人类总是不断发展的，自然界也总是不断发展的，永远不会停止在一个水平上。因此，人类总得不断地总结经验，有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”
    遵循毛主席的这一教导，各地农民群众和农村革命干部在总结经验的基础上，把在文化大革命中焕发起来的冲天干劲，用到积极创造增产条件的斗争中去。扩大水浇地是易旱地区农业增产的重要条件。去冬今春，许多地区就大力兴修农田水利，把旱地改成水浇地。南北各地广大农民群众和农村革命干部，还在总结经验的基础上，在播种方法、播种工具和田间管理、病虫防治等方面，都进行了不少改革，在不同程度上做到了“有所发现，有所发明，有所创造，有所前进。”
    夏粮作物相继成熟之后，各地又根据毛主席“每年一定要把收割、保管、吃用三件事（收、管、吃）抓得很紧很紧”的教导，组成强大的夏收劳动大军，以对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争为动力，狠抓夏粮的“收割、保管、吃用”，努力做到精收细打，颗粒归仓，适时安排分配和征购工作。山西、山东、贵州、四川、北京、上海等省、市，都组织了大批革命职工、革命师生、革命干部和解放军指战员到农村去，同农民群众、农村革命干部一道并肩战斗。由于无产阶级文化大革命激发了广大群众的革命干劲，加上各方面的大力支援，不仅大大加速了夏收进度，而且也显著地提高了夏收质量，不少地区夏粮分配和征购工作也搞得比往年好。
    我国亿万农民群众和广大农村革命干部无比兴奋地认为，今年全国夏粮大丰收，是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利成果，是贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”方针的结果，是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的又一伟大胜利。广大农民群众和农村革命干部决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，大抓革命，猛促生产，在力争适时地、高质量地完成夏种任务的同时，积极加强秋收作物的田间管理，决心战胜各种自然灾害，继续争取秋季粮食大丰收。
