The leadership of the Wuhan Military Region of the People's Liberation Army issued a public announcement on the 26th, openly admitting to the masses that they had made errors in direction and line in their work of supporting the left, expressing their determination to correct these errors thoroughly and promptly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The announcement exposed and criticized the various crimes committed by a handful of power-holders within the Party and the military in Wuhan who are taking the capitalist road in their frenzied counterattack. They also expressed their determination to stand firmly with the revolutionary masses of Wuhan, fight together, and achieve victory together. The stance and policies they are now taking are correct and in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "If one has made mistakes, one must openly admit them to the masses in an objective and honest way and immediately correct them." "Making mistakes is inevitable, but as long as one corrects them sincerely, it will be all right." The announcement by the leadership of the Wuhan Military Region shows that they are willing to act in accordance with Chairman Mao's instructions. Therefore, it has been warmly supported by the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Wuhan garrison and warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses of Wuhan.

In the recent great struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads in Wuhan, the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the army, navy, and air force have stood firmly with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, fought shoulder to shoulder, and resolutely carried out the Party Central Committee's instructions on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan, resolutely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and resolutely smashed the frenzied attacks by a handful of power-holders within the Party and the military who are taking the capitalist road and a handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. They have made outstanding contributions to the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are indeed loyal defenders of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and good soldiers of Chairman Mao.

The chief culprits who have sabotaged the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan are China's Khrushchev and his agents, a handful of power-holders within the Party and the military in Wuhan who are taking the capitalist road. They have done a great deal of evil. They fabricated various rumors, distorted the facts, confused right and wrong, reversed black and white, deceived and misled the masses, and pushed the support-left work of the Wuhan garrison onto the wrong path. Some officers and soldiers, temporarily unaware of the truth, said some wrong things and did some wrong things, but the responsibility lies entirely with the handful of power-holders within the Party and the military who are taking the capitalist road. The officers and soldiers who were deceived are not to blame. Now, they have opened their eyes, corrected their direction, and launched a counterattack, returning to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. By doing so, they have shown that they love Chairman Mao, are loyal to Chairman Mao, and listen to Chairman Mao's words. We believe that these comrades, including some leading cadres who have made errors in direction and line but are determined to correct them, will be able to perform new meritorious deeds for the people in their future support-left work.

The People's Liberation Army is the most loving of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. Once the officers and soldiers who were deceived come into broad contact with the revolutionary youngsters and understand the truth, they will quickly establish deep class feelings with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in their common struggle.

The revolutionary masses of the proletariat are the most loving of the People's Liberation Army. They are the most reasonable and the most able to act in accordance with the Party's policies. Comrades who have made mistakes, as long as they admit their mistakes, change their stance, and stand on the side of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, resolutely supporting them, can obtain their understanding, trust, and support.

For some comrades who temporarily do not understand, we must patiently do work to help them turn around.

At present, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan and the support-left work of the Wuhan garrison are both in a very good situation. However, the struggle is still arduous. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, carry out the "Support the Army, Love the People" activities, strengthen military-civilian unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, and push the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan forward!

    坚决同武汉地区无产阶级革命派战斗在一起
    人民解放军武汉部队领导机关二十六日发表公告，向群众公开承认，他们在支左工作中犯了方向、路线错误，表示要坚决、彻底改正错误，迅速回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。公告对武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派疯狂反扑的种种罪行，进行了揭露和批判。他们还表示，要坚决同武汉地区无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。他们现在所采取的立场和政策是正确的，是符合毛泽东思想的。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：犯了错误要“实事求是地公开向群众承认错误，并立即改正。”“犯错误是难免的，只要认真改了，就好了。”武汉部队领导机关的这个公告，表明他们是愿意按照毛主席的指示办事的。因此受到武汉驻军广大指战员的热烈拥护，受到武汉地区无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的热烈欢迎。
    在最近武汉地区两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大搏斗中，陆海空三军的广大干部、战士，紧紧同无产阶级革命派站在一起，并肩战斗，坚决执行党中央对武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命的指示，坚决捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚决粉碎了党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和“百万雄师”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头的猖狂进攻。他们为无产阶级文化大革命作出了卓越的贡献。他们不愧为无产阶级文化大革命的忠诚保卫者，不愧为毛主席的好战士。
    破坏武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命的罪魁祸首，是中国的赫鲁晓夫以及他在那里的代理人武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。他们干了大量的坏事。他们制造种种谣言，歪曲事实真相，混淆是非，颠倒黑白，欺骗和蒙蔽群众，把武汉驻军的支左工作推上了错误的道路。一些干部战士一时不明真相，说了一些错话，做了一些错事，责任完全在党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的身上。受蒙蔽的干部和战士是无罪的。现在，他们已经擦亮眼睛，端正方向，大杀回马枪，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。他们这样做了，表明他们是热爱毛主席、忠于毛主席的，是听毛主席的话的。我们相信这些同志，包括一些犯过方向、路线错误而决心改正的领导干部，在今后的支左工作中是能够为人民立新功的。
    人民解放军是最热爱无产阶级革命派的。过去受蒙蔽的干部战士，一旦广泛接触了革命小将，了解了事情的真相，就会在共同的战斗中，迅速地同无产阶级革命派建立起深厚的阶级感情。
    无产阶级革命派是最热爱人民解放军的。他们最通情达理，最能够按照党的政策办事。犯过错误的同志，只要承认了错误，把立场改变过来，站到无产阶级革命派一边，坚决支持他们，就可以得到他们的谅解，得到他们的信任和拥护。
    对于某些一时思想不通的同志，我们要耐心地做工作，帮助他们转变过来。
    目前，武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命，武汉驻军的支左工作，都是一片大好形势。但是，斗争还是艰巨的。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，开展“拥军爱民”活动，在毛泽东思想的基础上加强军民团结，把武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命推向前进！　（七月二十九日）
