Members of the Chaoyang Production Brigade in Heilongjiang Province's Lindian County Dongfeng People's Commune use the fields as their battlefield to launch a revolutionary criticism and denunciation campaign, purging the poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev. They use "Quotations from Chairman Mao" as their weapon to severely criticize the fallacies of the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Harbin, July 6th: The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of Chaoyang Production Brigade in Dongfeng People's Commune, Lindian County, Heilongjiang Province, have raised the banner of revolutionary criticism. During the weeding season, they use the fields as their battlefield to extensively criticize the top handful of party persons in authority taking the capitalist road, purging their poison, and making the revolution and production flourish.

The revolutionary criticism in Chaoyang Production Brigade has been vigorously carried out for a long time. However, after the start of weeding, some people thought: We have held many criticism meetings and written many big-character posters; it's time to stop and focus on weeding. Others thought: During the busy weeding season, work starts early and ends late, with short breaks, making it difficult to hold large meetings and carry out criticism. The "three-in-one" leading group of this brigade believed that this issue essentially involves whether to carry out criticism during the busy agricultural season and whether to implement Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production." It must be seriously addressed. They immediately organized revolutionary masses and cadres to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Carry the Revolution Through to the End" and launched a great discussion throughout the brigade on whether to "carry the revolution through to the end" or to "halt halfway." Many poor and lower-middle peasants said: If we do not purge the poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev in our brigade, the Cultural Revolution will be halted halfway. The battle has just begun; we must not stop! The busier we are, the more we must carry out criticism, and we must do it well.

The revolutionary masses of this brigade, based on the characteristics of agricultural work during the weeding season, decided to adopt a combination of concentrated and dispersed efforts to extensively carry out field "guerrilla warfare" in their criticism activities. In the fields, they used break times to hold small meetings, each time studying one aspect of Chairman Mao's quotations, criticizing one fallacy of the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road, purging one poison, settling one account, and establishing one revolutionary viewpoint. Since the start of weeding, the entire brigade has held more than seventy small meetings, criticizing more than ten reactionary fallacies propagated by the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road, such as "exploitation is justified," "the theory of the extinction of class struggle," and "three freedoms and one contract," making the movement vigorous.

In their criticism of the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres paid special attention to linking it with the actual class struggle and current production in their brigade, achieving both the purging of poison and the elimination of its roots, making it visible, tangible, deep, and thorough. During the criticism of "three freedoms and one contract," the poor and lower-middle peasants said: Chairman Mao teaches us to take the socialist road, but the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road advocates more private plots, more small-scale farming, and more free markets, opening the green light for the capitalist road, causing frequent conflicts between collective land and private plots over labor and time in the past. Some members said that in the past, some people were poisoned by the fallacies spread by the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road, and while weeding, their minds were on their private plots, carefully tending to them while neglecting the collective land, resulting in the impact on the collective economy's development and the socialist road. This is indeed a poisoned sweetness that breaks the heart! During the criticism of the "theory of the extinction of class struggle," some poor peasant members immediately exposed the reactionary crimes of landlords hiding land deeds. The onlookers, filled with indignation, said: This is all because the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road gave them support and courage. We must definitely overthrow these monsters' backers and stomp on them with our feet. Sixty-three-year-old old poor peasant He Shiqi, during the criticism of "exploitation is justified," tearfully recounted his tragic family history. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants angrily shouted: "Never forget class bitterness, always remember blood debts!" "New and old grievances must be avenged together!" "Overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev!"

The revolutionary criticism has promoted the thought reform of the people. The broad masses of Chaoyang Production Brigade love Chairman Mao even more, and their enthusiasm for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works is even higher. The entire brigade has significantly increased its attendance rate during the weeding season and completed the first weeding half a month earlier than in previous years. Now, the crops in this brigade are full and uniform, growing vigorously.

　　朝阳大队社员以田间为战场开展革命的大批判
　　肃清中国的赫鲁晓夫散布的流毒
　　他们以《毛主席语录》为武器，狠狠批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的谬论
    据新华社哈尔滨六日电　黑龙江省林甸县东风公社朝阳大队贫下中农和革命干部，高举革命的批判旗帜，在夏锄期间，以田间为战场，广泛开展对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，肃清其流毒，使革命和生产呈现一派大好形势。
    朝阳大队的革命大批判，早就轰轰烈烈地开展起来了。但夏锄开始以后，有些人认为：批判会开了多次，大字报写了不少，该收兵投入夏锄大忙了。还有人认为：夏锄大忙季节出工早，收工晚，歇气短，大会开不了，大批判搞不好。这个大队的“三结合”领导班子认为，这个问题，实质上是农忙时期要不要搞大批判，要不要贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示的重大问题，必须认真解决。他们立即组织革命群众、革命干部，反复学习了毛主席的光辉著作《将革命进行到底》，在全大队开展了一场“是将革命进行到底还是半途而废？”的大讨论。许多贫下中农说：中国的赫鲁晓夫散布到我们队的流毒不肃清，草草收兵，无产阶级文化大革命就会半途而废。现在战斗刚刚打响，决不能收兵！越忙越要搞大批判，而且还要搞好。
    这个大队的革命群众根据夏锄季节农活特点，决定采用集中和分散相结合，广泛开展田间“游击战”作战方法，开展大批判活动。在田间，他们利用歇气时间开小会，每次会学习毛主席一个方面的语录，批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的一个谬论，肃清一股流毒，算一笔账，树立一个革命的观点。夏锄以来，全大队已经开了七十多次小会，批判了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派宣扬的“剥削有理”、“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“三自一包”等十几个反动谬论，运动搞得轰轰烈烈。
    贫下中农和革命干部在对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派展开的大批判中，特别注意同本队的阶级斗争实际和当前生产实际联系起来，做到既肃清流毒，又挖根子，看得见，摸得着，挖得深，批得透。在批判“三自一包”时，贫下中农说：毛主席教导我们走社会主义道路，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却鼓吹多搞自留地，多搞小开荒，多跑自由市场，为资本主义道路大开绿灯，致使过去常常出现集体地和自留地争劳力，争时间的现象。有的社员说，过去有的人中了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派散布的毒素，在铲地时，身在集体地里，心在自留地里，侍弄自留地深耕细作，侍弄集体地马马虎虎，结果，影响了集体经济的发展，冲击了社会主义道路。这真是毒药沾糖，甜嘴断肠！在批判“阶级斗争熄灭论”时，有的贫农社员当场揭发了地主分子隐藏地契的反动罪行。在场群众听了无比愤怒地说：这都是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派给他们撑腰、壮胆的结果，我们一定要把这些牛鬼蛇神的总后台打翻在地，再踏上一只脚。六十三岁的老贫农贺士起在批判“剥削有理”时，一字一泪地讲述了他的悲惨家史。广大贫下中农愤怒地高呼：“不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇！”“新仇旧恨要一起报！”“打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫！”
    革命的大批判，促进了人的思想革命化。朝阳大队的广大社员对毛主席更加热爱，活学活用毛主席著作的热情更加高涨。全大队在夏锄生产中，出勤率大大提高，并且比往年提前半个月铲完了头遍地。现在这个大队的庄稼苗全、苗齐，长势喜人。
