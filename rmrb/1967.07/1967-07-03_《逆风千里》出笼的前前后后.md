The counterrevolutionary film "Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles" was fraught with class struggle and a sharp conflict between two lines throughout its production process. In 1958, the script for "Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles" was completed, and the capitalist-roaders within the Zhuhai Film Studio immediately regarded it as a "treasure." However, due to mass resistance, it could not be filmed, so they had to store it away, waiting for an opportunity to release it. By the end of 1961, amidst the anti-China chorus stirred up by imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, the counterrevolutionary revisionist Chen Huangmei "visited" Zhuhai to "inspect" it. He immediately spotted this weed and praised it highly, saying, "I have read this script. The subject matter is novel, and it has a basis in life... The script just needs to be trimmed at the beginning and end to be ready for filming." By "trimming the beginning and end," he meant removing the few scenes in the script that depicted the victory of our army. He also encouraged the scriptwriters and directors, saying, "You should open up your own world."

One of the top capitalist-roaders within the Party was the behind-the-scenes director of this counterrevolutionary film. He was enthusiastic about promoting it from the start, using every means to ensure its release. When he reviewed the sample film twice, he fully endorsed it: "This film is good, and everyone is very interested in it!" But he was still not satisfied, feeling that "in a situation where the enemy is strong and we are weak, our army having no casualties is too unrealistic." Thus, he racked his brains and proposed so-called "revision opinions," maliciously demanding that our soldier Ji Pengfei die while blowing up the bridge, ending the film in a tragic atmosphere full of defeatism, thus slandering our great People's Liberation Army. After this counterrevolutionary film was severely criticized by a responsible comrade at the central level and ordered to be banned, this capitalist-roader still resisted, repeatedly claiming that "the problem is not that serious," and frequently urging the scriptwriters and directors to make minor revisions and release it immediately.

With the green light from the top capitalist-roaders within the Party and the support of revisionists in the film industry, the film's scriptwriters and directors were fearless and employed their counterrevolutionary tricks, sparing no effort to cultivate this big weed. The director stipulated that the film should "portray the moral qualities of two types of party members (Communist Party and Kuomintang)." In his mind, the "moral qualities" of Communist Party members were to befriend the enemy and be weak and incompetent; while the "moral qualities" of Kuomintang members were to be "sincerely united" and "unyielding." To sing praises for the Kuomintang reactionaries and beautify the enemy prisoners' "unyielding" spirit, he even fabricated such a plot: when the enemy intelligence chief Yang Ziming escaped on horseback, the enemy commander Sun Zhenrong bravely stepped forward and fearlessly hugged the horse's head of our platoon leader Song Zhigang. Song Zhigang wanted to pursue but couldn't, raised his gun to shoot, but Sun Zhenrong stood tall and unmoving, facing death with composure. Sun Zhenrong then "jumped into the sea and sacrificed himself" to show his "loyalty to the party and nation." While the scriptwriters and directors were pouring their hearts into erecting monuments for the enemy, they still felt that the script slandered our army insufficiently. In the revision, they added such a plot: how our medical soldier Zhu Xiaoling diligently cared for the enemy prisoners, massaged their feet, which led to the enemy deputy commander's wild fantasies; the enemy deputy commander dreamed of holding Zhu Xiaoling's hand and walking into a church to get married. This extremely malicious plot was only deleted due to the resolute opposition of revolutionary masses. The film's scriptwriters and directors loved the Kuomintang reactionaries to the point of wanting them to live, and hated the People's Liberation Army to the point of wanting them to die, their reactionary class stance was so clear!

Chairman Mao said: "To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counterrevolutionary class is also like this." The counterrevolutionary film "Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles" is a piece of ideological preparation for the top capitalist-roaders within the Party and their clique attempting to overthrow the proletarian dictatorship. We must wield the mighty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to smash the broken trumpet of "Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles" that advocates counterrevolutionary restoration, extinguish this evil wind that defames our army and summons the spirits of the Kuomintang reactionaries, and let the mighty east wind blow across the globe!

　　《逆风千里》出笼的前前后后
　　边齐
    反动影片《逆风千里》在摄制过程中，始终贯穿着两个阶级、两条路线的尖锐斗争。一九五八年，《逆风千里》的电影剧本一出笼，珠江电影制片厂党内走资本主义道路当权派就把它视作“珍宝”。但由于群众抵制，不能拍摄，他们只好将其库存，伺机出笼。一九六一年底，在帝、修、反掀起的反华大合唱中，反革命修正主义分子陈荒煤“驾临”珠影“视察”，一眼看中了这棵毒草，赞不绝口，说什么“这剧本我看过了，题材新颖，有生活基础……剧本去头去尾就可以拍摄。”所谓“去头去尾”，就是去掉剧本中仅有的一些描写我军胜利的场面。他还给编导者打气，说什么“要为自己打开自己的天地”。
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派中的一个人，就是这部反动影片的幕后总导演。他自始至终“热心”扶植，想方设法让它出笼。他两次“审查”这部影片的样片时，都充分肯定：“这部片子不错，大家看了还很有兴趣！”但他还不够满足，觉得“在敌强我弱的情况下，我军没有伤亡，这太不真实了。”于是他冥思苦想，提出了所谓“修改意见”，恶毒地要让我军战士纪鹏飞在炸桥时死去，使影片在充满着失败主义的悲剧气氛中收场，以诽谤我们伟大的人民军队。当时这部反动影片受到中央一位负责同志的严厉批判，并指令禁演以后，这个走资本主义道路当权派还百般抵制，一再宣称“问题没有那么严重”，并多次催促编导者稍加粉饰后立即出笼。
    有党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开放绿灯，有电影界的反革命修正主义分子撑腰打气，影片编导者有恃无恐，便施展其反革命伎俩，挖空心思经营这棵大毒草。导演规定影片要“写出两种党员（共产党和国民党）的道德品质”。在他的心目中，共产党员的“道德品质”就是认敌为友，软弱无能；而国民党员的“道德品质”就是“精诚团结”，“坚贞不屈”。他为了给国民党反动派唱赞歌，美化敌俘“坚贞不屈”，竟编造出这样的情节：敌特工处长杨子鸣夺马逃跑时，敌师长孙振戎挺身而出，奋不顾身地抱住我军指导员宋志刚的马头，宋志刚欲追不能，举枪要打，孙振戎昂然不动，视死如归。孙振戎途经大海又“投海捐躯”，以示“效忠党国”。编导者在呕心沥血地为敌人树碑立传的同时，还嫌剧本对我军诬蔑得不够，他在改编中竟增添了这样一个情节：我军卫生员朱小玲如何热心照护敌俘，为敌俘揉脚，结果引起敌副师长的胡思乱想；敌副师长在梦中挽着朱小玲的手走进教堂结婚。这个用心极其恶毒的情节，由于革命群众的坚决反对，导演才不得不忍痛删去。影片编导者对国民党反动派爱之欲其生，对中国人民解放军恨之欲其死，其反动阶级的立场何其鲜明！
    毛主席说：“凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”反动影片《逆风千里》就是为党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其一伙企图推翻无产阶级政权作舆论准备的。我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，砸碎《逆风千里》这个鼓吹反革命复辟的破喇叭，扑灭这股丑化我军、为国民党反动派招魂的逆风，让浩荡的东风吹遍全球！
