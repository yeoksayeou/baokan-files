She studies "Quotations from Chairman Mao" every day during her commute to work. Under the great guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, this young woman worker has sharpened her eyes, distinguished between enemies and friends, and clearly seen through true and false friends. She bravely fights against the enemies who sabotage the Japan-China friendship movement. A Vietnamese comrade fighting on the front lines of the anti-American struggle said: "Chairman Mao's people's war thought has armed us, making us firmly believe that American imperialism will be defeated and the Vietnamese people will be victorious."

    亿万革命人民纵情欢呼：红色宝书“给千百万人民带来了马克思列宁主义”“给整个人类世界带来了光明”！他们纷纷表示：“一辈子学习《毛主席语录》”“永远跟着毛主席干革命”！
    新华社一日讯　本社记者报道：“四海翻腾云水怒，五洲震荡风雷激。”当世界革命人民昂首阔步进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的崭新的历史时代的时候，在震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的凯歌声中，在亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族解放运动的浪潮汹涌澎湃、滚滚向前的时候，中国出版的红色宝书《毛主席语录》外文版在全世界广泛传播，八个月内发行八十多万册，销行于一百多个国家和地区，受到了亿万革命人民最热烈的欢迎和最热情的颂扬。《毛主席语录》在全世界广泛发行，这是国际共产主义运动史上的一个重大事件，这是史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命的又一伟大胜利。
    据不完全的统计，从一九六六年十月到一九六七年五月，中国国际书店已向全世界一百一十七个国家和地区发行了英、法、西班牙、日、俄、德、意、尼泊尔、越南、印度尼西亚、阿拉伯、缅甸、斯瓦希里、波斯等十四种文本的《毛主席语录》共八十多万册。
    此外，许多国家的革命群众和进步团体，为了满足广大读者对《毛主席语录》的渴望，已经自己着手进行翻译和出版工作。据最近的消息，目前在英国、法国、意大利、日本、西德、希腊、荷兰、比利时、丹麦、瑞典、挪威、锡兰、印度、巴基斯坦、叙利亚、老挝等十六个国家，已经有当地出版的英、法、僧伽罗、泰米尔、马拉雅拉姆、乌尔都、老挝等十六种文字、二十四种版本《毛主席语录》。以日本为例，自去年十一月到今年三月为止，就翻译出版了四种日文版的《毛主席语录》近三十万册。最近，日本“东方书店”和其他一些进步书店和团体，还根据人民群众进行学习、工作和斗争的实际需要，从《毛主席语录》中选择有关部分出版《毛主席语录抄》，并且印制了三十多种《毛主席语录标语》，大量供应。
    世界亿万革命人民纵情欢呼：《毛主席语录》外文版的出版和广泛发行“给千百万人民带来了马克思列宁主义”，“给整个人类世界带来了光明”！《毛主席语录》鼓舞并增强了革命人民“早日把毛泽东思想学到手的信心和决心”。他们纷纷表示，要“一辈子学习《毛主席语录》”，“永远跟着毛主席干革命”。
    世界革命人民渴望得到《毛主席语录》，就象久旱的禾苗期待甘霖，象雾海的航船向往灯塔。在战火纷飞的越南南方战场上，越南南方爱国军民把《毛主席语录》看作是战胜敌人的强大武器。在修正主义领导集团白色恐怖统治下的苏联，一位青年激动地指着《毛主席语录》说：“苏联人民太需要这本书了！”“苏联人民决心要好好学习毛泽东著作。”在蓬勃展开争生存、反暴政斗争的印度，那里的革命群众深深感到只有毛泽东思想才能把他们从水深火热之中解放出来。一位印度工会工作者说：“《毛主席语录》是对我们正在受苦受难的印度人民的最大鼓舞，是使我们的斗争取得胜利的伟大保证。”
    为了获得红色宝书《毛主席语录》，多少国家的革命者想方设法、东寻西托。有的向亲朋好友索取或借阅；有的专程到各地书店甚至到邻国的书店去购买；有的冲破重重障碍，甚至不顾生命危险到处寻找。那些一时买不到这本宝书的革命者，为了早日把光焰无际的毛泽东思想学到手，便不辞劳苦，夜以继日地一个字一个字地把毛主席语录抄写下来。有的把新华社在国外发行的外文版新闻稿上每一期刊登的毛主席语录逐条逐条精心地剪下来，汇集成本，如饥似渴地进行学习。
    《毛主席语录》深受世界革命人民的热爱和欢迎。许多国家的书店收到订购的《毛主席语录》后常常在几天中，甚至在几小时内就被读者争购一空。这种空前的盛况使这些国家的出版者感到吃惊。他们说：“从来没有过任何一本书，象《毛主席语录》那样受到读者如此的热爱和欢迎”，“这真是一件了不起的事”。从世界各地向中国订购《毛主席语录》的信件更象雪片般地飞来。千万封来信中表达了一个共同愿望：迫切需要《毛主席语录》。一位外国朋友在来信中满怀希望地写道：“要是能够把《毛主席语录》寄给我，我就成为世界上最快乐的人了。”许多订书的电函上这样写着：“请尽可能大量寄来！”“我急需要这本书！”“请用最快的方式寄运！”等等。
    当革命人民得到《毛主席语录》时，他们无不兴高采烈，欢欣鼓舞。真是如获至宝。他们热情赞扬金光闪闪的小红书，“内容最丰富、分析最深刻、语言简朴，最能为人民群众所理解”，它是“真理的宝库”、“斗争的指南”、“胜利的象征”。许多国家的革命者一拿到手，就在电车上、路灯下或者马路边全神贯注地读起来。几内亚一位农业技术员在得到一本法文版《毛主席语录》时兴奋地说：“太好了，这是我生平最大的幸福！”从此以后，无论上工下工，《毛主席语录》从不离身。他利用一切可以利用的时间进行学习和记笔记。现在，《毛主席语录》中的每一条他都读了六、七遍，有的多达十几遍。许多重要的语录，他已能流利地背诵出来。在古巴山区，一位老农民从中国同志那里得到一本西班牙文版的《毛主席语录》时，激动地高举红书说：“同志们，放心吧，我一定好好学习这本书！”一位古巴职员喜获宝书后说：“我不仅要阅读和学习这本宝书，而且还要象中国同志那样在生活中和工作中活用。”日本一位名叫上村的青年女工学习《毛主席语录》后深有体会地说：“毛主席的话，句句是真理。毛主席的话，每一句都说到我们工人的心坎上。”她每天还利用乘车上工时间学习《毛主席语录》。这位青年女工在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大教导下，更加擦亮了眼睛，分清了敌我界线，辨明了真假朋友，从而毅然地同破坏日中友好运动的敌人展开英勇的斗争。战斗在反美斗争最前哨的一位越南同志说：“毛主席的人民战争思想武装了我们，使我们坚信美帝国主义必败，越南人民必胜。”
    许多外国朋友在学习《毛主席语录》后纷纷给中国朋友来信表示，他们要求永远跟着毛主席闹革命，一定要把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全世界，把帝国主义、现代修正主义和一切反动派统统消灭干净。现在，许多国家的革命者都随身带着《毛主席语录》，随时学习和运用。他们决心用光焰无际的毛泽东思想来指导自己的每一个行动。帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想，正在日益深入世界人民心中。一个学习和运用毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》的热潮正在世界革命人民中间掀起。
