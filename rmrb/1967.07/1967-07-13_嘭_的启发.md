I was sent to the Yujin San Mine in Suixi County, Anhui Province, to carry out the task of supporting the left. After a period of deep and arduous work, I gradually became familiar with the situation, and my work became more manageable. Many difficulties were resolved one by one. Unknowingly, my sense of pride and self-satisfaction began to surface again.

Once, a worker caused an accident due to a lack of responsibility. I called him in and gave him a stern lecture, even making him write a written self-criticism. After my talk, he slammed the door shut with a "bang" and stormed off. That "bang" was a silent criticism of me. It was like a stick hitting my head and resonating in my heart. I thought: this worker should indeed be criticized. However, my attitude was wrong. I did not patiently explain the reasons, tell him where he went wrong, and help him recognize and correct his mistakes. My attitude stemmed from a sense of pride and self-satisfaction, from a sense of personal authority as a "savior." This shows that I had once again reversed the positions of myself and the masses. This is a recurrence of an old problem.

If a flaw reappears, it must be fought against repeatedly. Chairman Mao said: "If there are no contradictions and struggles to resolve them in the Party, the life of the Party will stop." For an individual, if there are no contradictions and struggles to resolve them, the political life of the individual will stop. Struggle, advance, struggle again, advance again—this is the law. Thinking of this, I could no longer suppress my inner excitement. I immediately found the worker comrade, made a self-criticism, and listened to his criticism of me. He acknowledged his mistake of causing the accident due to a lack of responsibility, but he also said excitedly: "You truly are a good soldier of Chairman Mao, a hero of the people."

I said: No! The true heroes are not me, but the revolutionary masses armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong. I am a student, forever a student.

    “嘭”的启发
    解放军某部营长　黄在渔
    我到安徽濉溪市跃进三矿执行支左任务。经过一段深入艰苦的工作，情况渐渐熟悉了，工作比较顺手了，许多困难一个一个解决了，不知不觉之中，我的骄傲自满情绪又露头了。
    有一次，一位工人因责任心不强，造成了事故。我就把他叫来批评了一顿，还让人家写书面检讨。我谈完话，他就“嘭”一声，狠狠地把门带上掉头走了。“嘭”的一声是对我的一个无言的批评。它象一根木棍打在我的头上，震在我的心里。我想：这位工人是应该批评的。但是我批评的态度不好，不是耐心地讲清道理，告诉他错在哪里，便于他认识和改正。我这种态度，来自头脑中的自满自足的骄傲感，来自以“救世主”自居的个人权威感，这说明我又把自己和群众的位置颠倒了。这是老毛病的一个新的反复。
    缺点反复出现就得反复斗争。毛主席说：“党内如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，党的生命也就停止了。”对于个人来说，如果没有矛盾和解决矛盾的思想斗争，个人的政治生命也就停止了。斗争，前进，再斗争，再前进，这是规律。想到这里，我再也按不下内心的激动，马上找到这位工人同志，作了检查，听取了他对自己的批评。他一方面承认了自己由于责任心不强造成事故的错误，同时激动地说：“你真不愧是毛主席的好战士，人民的英雄。”
  （编者注：黄在渔同志是战斗英雄。）我说：不！真正的英雄不是我，是用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众。我是一个学生，永远是一个学生。
