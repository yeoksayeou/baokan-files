The Soviet revisionist leadership, which acted as the chief accomplice of U.S. imperialism in instigating and supporting Israel's aggression against Arab countries, convened an emergency meeting of the pseudo-Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization in Cairo, the capital of the United Arab Republic, from July 1 to July 3. The purpose of this meeting, orchestrated by the Soviet revisionists, was to cover up their collusion with U.S. imperialism in the recent Middle East events, to conceal their betrayal of the Arab people, and to continue their counter-revolutionary strategy of pretending to support while actually betraying.

The permanent secretariat of the pseudo-Asian-African People's Solidarity Organization, acting on the instructions of the Soviet revisionists, actively prepared for this meeting. It was a poorly attended meeting, with only a third of the invited representatives present. In Cairo, eight African nationalist organizations refused to participate in this meeting.

The Soviet revisionists, feeling guilty, made meticulous arrangements for the proceedings of the meeting. They sent a delegation to Cairo several days before the meeting to engage in intense activities.

On the eve of the meeting (June 30), three leaders of the Soviet revisionists, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and Podgorny, jointly issued a telegram to set the tone and boost morale for the meeting. In the telegram, they made no condemnation of U.S. imperialism, the instigator of the aggression against Arab countries, but had the audacity to ask the Arab people to "believe" that the United Nations would "support" the legitimate demands of the Arab people.

On July 2, a Soviet revisionist delegation head named Nishanov, in his entire speech at the meeting, avoided mentioning the ironclad fact that U.S. imperialism instigated Israel to invade Arab countries, thus covering up the criminal acts of U.S. imperialism. Nishanov also blatantly lied, claiming that "in the first few hours of Israel's treacherous attack, the Soviet Union... firmly condemned the aggressors, strongly supported the just struggle of the Arab people, and took all measures to force the aggressors to stop military actions."

No matter how cunning the Soviet revisionists were, they eventually revealed their true colors. In the drafting committee of the meeting's statement, the Soviet revisionist representative exerted all efforts to defend the "legitimacy" of Israel, the tool of U.S. imperialism's aggression, and even forced other members of the committee to "praise" the Soviet Union's betrayal and the United Nations' intervention. The Soviet revisionist representative even threatened the drafting committee in a bullying tone to be "more realistic" in drafting the statement. What infuriated the attendees the most was that the Soviet revisionist representative insisted on including in the statement the phrase "all the benevolent, free, and peaceful forces in the world, first and foremost the Soviet Union, stand on the side of the Arab countries." Due to strong opposition, this shameless lie was deleted. However, in the so-called official statement distributed at the meeting and in the statement reported by TASS, the Soviet revisionists, disregarding all opposition, inserted this sentence again. The Soviet revisionists' arrogance and unreasonableness aroused strong dissatisfaction and opposition from many representatives. An African attendee pointed out: "This is indeed a repeat of what the Soviets did at the so-called Eighth Conference of the Asian-African Solidarity Council held illegally in Nicosia." An Asian attendee said: "The Soviet revisionist traitors are indeed the most despicable and dishonest people."

　　继续玩弄对阿拉伯人民假支持真出卖的卑鄙手法
　　苏修在伪亚非团结组织会议上大出其丑
　　为了掩饰叛卖罪行大耍无赖引起许多代表强烈不满
    据新华社开罗六日电　本社记者报道：在美帝国主义怂恿和支持以色列对阿拉伯国家发动侵略战争中，充当了美帝头号帮凶的苏联修正主义领导集团，于七月一日到三日在阿联首都开罗，一手策划召开了伪亚非人民团结组织紧急会议。召开这次会议的目的，是为了掩盖苏修集团在最近的中东事件中同美帝紧密配合狼狈为奸，出卖阿拉伯人民的累累罪行，并企图摆脱它遭到阿拉伯人民和全世界革命人民同声谴责的窘境，继续推行其假支持、真出卖的反革命两手策略。
    伪亚非人民团结组织常设书记处秉承苏修集团的意旨，积极筹划的这一会议，是一个开得很不景气的会议。应邀参加会议的代表来得稀稀拉拉，其中有三分之一的被邀代表没有出席会议。在开罗有八个非洲民族主义组织都拒绝参加这一会议。
    做贼心虚的苏修集团对会议的进行作了精心的安排，在会议开幕前的好几天就派出代表团到开罗进行紧张的活动。
    在会议前夕（六月三十日），苏修领导集团的三个头目勃列日涅夫、柯西金和波德戈尔内联名发出一份电报，为会议定调、打气。他们在电报中丝毫不谴责对阿拉伯国家发动侵略战争的罪魁祸首美帝国主义，却厚颜无耻地要阿拉伯人民“相信”什么“联合国”将“支持”阿拉伯人的正当要求。
    七月二日，一个叫尼沙诺夫的苏修代表团团长在会上的整个发言中根本避而不谈美帝唆使以色列侵略阿拉伯国家这一铁的事实，为美帝罪恶勾当打掩护。尼沙诺夫还睁着眼睛大扯其慌，胡说什么“在以色列背信弃义进攻的最初几小时，苏联……就坚决谴责侵略者，大力支持阿拉伯人民的正义斗争并采取一切措施迫使侵略者停止军事行动”。
    不管苏修怎样狡猾，最终还是露出了它的马脚。苏修代表在会议声明起草委员会的活动中，竭尽其力为美帝的侵略工具以色列“存在”的“合法性”辩护，并且竟然强迫委员会的其他成员“赞扬”苏联的叛卖罪行和联合国的干预。苏修代表甚至用恫吓的口吻要起草委员会起草声明时“现实一点”。尤其使与会者感到气愤的是苏修代表硬要在声明中写进什么“全世界一切善良的、自由的与和平的力量，首先是苏联，站在阿拉伯国家的一边”。由于遭到强烈的反对，这句无耻的谰言被删掉了。但在会议印发的所谓正式声明里以及塔斯社报道的声明里，苏修竟不顾一切，仍然把这句话擅自又塞进去。苏修如此猖狂无理，引起了许多代表的强烈不满和反对。一位非洲与会者指出：“这确实是苏联人在尼科西亚非法召开的所谓第八届亚非团结理事会会议上所干的勾当的翻版。”一位亚洲与会者说：“苏修叛徒真是最卑鄙、最不老实的人。”
