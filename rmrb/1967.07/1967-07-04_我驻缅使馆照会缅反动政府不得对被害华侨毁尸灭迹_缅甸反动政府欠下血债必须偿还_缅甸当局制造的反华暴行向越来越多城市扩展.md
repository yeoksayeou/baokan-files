	The Chinese Embassy in Burma issued a note to the Burmese Foreign Ministry on July 2, once again exposing the Burmese reactionary government's instigation of mobs to savagely massacre overseas Chinese and then cover up the evidence by destroying the bodies, in an attempt to evade responsibility for their crimes.

	The note sternly warned the Burmese government: "If there are no officials from the Chinese Embassy and family members of the victims present, you dare to destroy the bodies of the victims, then your crimes will be even more severe, and your mistakes will be compounded. The great Chinese people always keep their word. We will definitely settle accounts with you for your crimes!"

	The note stated that the Burmese government has recently committed heinous, inhuman, and unforgivable crimes against overseas Chinese. The massacre of many teachers and students of the Overseas Chinese Teachers' Joint Committee in Rangoon is just one of the many crimes committed by the Burmese government. The note pointed out: The Chinese government and the great seven hundred million Chinese people will never forget the blood debt you owe. Blood debts must be repaid!

	The note stated that the Chinese Embassy in Burma has made four requests to the Burmese Foreign Ministry to jointly inspect the bodies with the families of the deceased and missing persons and representatives of the overseas Chinese community, but all four requests were unreasonably rejected. In particular, on the afternoon of July 1, the Acting Charge d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Burma, Xiao Ming, met with U Laung, the Director of the First Political Department of the Burmese Foreign Ministry. U Laung was both evasive and stubborn, arrogant and cunning, and completely unreasonable. He neither provided a list of the victims nor unreasonably refused to notify the families of the victims to be present. U Laung even threatened to "deal with the bodies of the victims on their own."

	The note stated: "You killed people, you committed fascist atrocities, you are the culprits, you are the ones being judged. You want to prevent the families of the victims and the missing persons and representatives of the overseas Chinese community from identifying the bodies with us, which is an attempt to evade judgment out of fear of crime, and this is absolutely unacceptable." The note made four strong demands: "First, provide us with an accurate list of the victims and notify the families of the victims and the missing persons and representatives of the overseas Chinese community to identify the bodies with us. Delaying and evading is not acceptable. Second, after we and the families of the deceased, the missing persons, and representatives of the overseas Chinese community identify the bodies, you must be responsible for holding a solemn funeral and memorial ceremony for the deceased. Third, severely punish the perpetrators, compensate the families of the deceased, and make amends for all losses. Fourth, publicly apologize to the Chinese people and overseas Chinese, admit guilt, and ensure that such incidents do not happen again."

	The note emphasized that these four points must be fully implemented, not one can be omitted. The Chinese Embassy is awaiting an immediate response from the Burmese government.

	A responsible official from the First Asian Affairs Department of the Chinese Foreign Ministry also conducted a serious diplomatic exchange with the Burmese Embassy in Beijing on July 2 regarding the above issues.

	The anti-Chinese atrocities instigated by the Burmese reactionary government continue to spread to Bhamo, Taunggyi, Bawli, Mawlamyine, and other places.

	In the central Burmese city of Bhamo, more than three thousand rioters engaged in anti-Chinese activities on July 1. These rioters wildly shouted anti-Chinese slogans.

	In Taunggyi, the capital of Shan State, some rioters held anti-Chinese activities on July 1 and posted anti-Chinese slogans in the city. The rioters arrogantly shouted, "'The Red Government of Beijing, China' should withdraw its statement about Burma."

	In Bawli and Mawlamyine, some rioters posted anti-Chinese slogans. The rioters even threatened to smash the shops of overseas Chinese.

	In Pyinmana, more than two thousand rioters gathered for a second time on July 2 to engage in rampant anti-Chinese activities.

　　我驻缅使馆照会缅反动政府不得对被害华侨毁尸灭迹
　　缅甸反动政府欠下血债必须偿还
　　缅甸当局制造的反华暴行向越来越多城市扩展
    新华社三日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆二日照会缅甸外交部，再次揭露缅甸反动政府唆使暴徒野蛮屠杀华侨，而后又玩弄毁尸灭迹，妄图逃避罪责的阴谋。
    照会严正警告缅甸政府：“如果没有中国大使馆官员和被害者家属在场，你们胆敢妄自对被害者进行毁尸灭迹，你们就罪加一等，错上加错。伟大的中国人民从来都是说话算数的，我们一定要加倍清算你们的罪恶！”
    照会说，缅甸政府最近对华侨犯下了震惊世界的、惨无人道的、不可饶恕的罪行。仰光华侨教师联合委员会大批职工和学生被害就是缅甸政府所犯下的无数罪恶之一。照会指出：中国政府和伟大的七亿中国人民，永远也忘不了你们所欠下的血债，血债一定要偿还！
    照会说，中国驻缅甸大使馆曾四次向缅甸外交部提出要会同死难者家属、失踪者家属和侨团代表察验尸体，但四次都被无理拒绝。特别是七月一日下午中国驻缅甸大使馆临时代办肖明会见缅甸外交部第一政治司司长吴拉昂时，吴拉昂既拖又赖，蛮横狡猾，毫不讲理。他既不提供被害者名单，又无理拒绝通知被害者家属到场。吴拉昂甚至要挟说，要对被害者的尸体“自行处理”。
    照会说：“你们杀了人，你们犯下了法西斯暴行，你们是罪魁祸首，你们是被审判者。你们想阻止被害者家属、失踪者家属和侨团代表同我们一起去认尸，这是想畏罪逃避审判，是绝对不能容许的。”照会提出四项强烈要求：“一、向我们如实地提供被害者的名单，并通知被害者家属、失踪者家属和侨团代表同我们一起去认尸。拖和赖是不行的。二、在我们和死难者家属、失踪者家属和侨团代表认尸以后，你们必须负责为死难者举行隆重的安葬和公祭仪式。三、严惩凶手，抚恤死难家属，赔偿一切损失。四、公开向中国人民和华侨道歉认罪，切实保证以后不再发生此类事件。”
    照会强调说，这四条，一条也不能少，必须一一照办。中国大使馆等待着缅甸政府的立即回答。
    中国外交部第一亚洲司负责人二日在北京也向缅甸驻华大使馆，就上述问题进行了严正的交涉。
    新华社三日讯　仰光消息：缅甸反动政府制造的反华暴行继续扩展到彬文那、东枝、卑谬、毛淡棉以及其他一些地方。
    在缅甸中部的城市彬文那，一日有三千多暴徒进行反华活动。这些暴徒疯狂地叫喊反华口号。
    在掸邦首府东枝，一些暴徒一日举行了反华的活动，并在城里张贴了反华标语。暴徒们狂妄地叫喊“‘北京红色中国政府’收回它关于缅甸的声明”。
    在卑谬和毛淡棉，一些暴徒张贴反华标语，暴徒甚至扬言要砸华侨商店。
    在勃生，二日有两千多暴徒第二次聚集在一起进行猖狂反华活动。
