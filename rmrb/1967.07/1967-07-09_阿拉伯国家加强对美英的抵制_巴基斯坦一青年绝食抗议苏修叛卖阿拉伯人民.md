Arab countries are strengthening their boycott against the U.S. and Britain. A Pakistani youth goes on hunger strike to protest against the Soviet revisionists' betrayal of the Arab people.

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on July 8, the Lebanese government decided on July 6 to boycott the American Coca-Cola Company, the American Broadcasting Company, and the Ford Motor Company.

The Lebanese government's decision is a response to the Arab countries' decision to boycott Israel and companies dealing with Israel, and it is a protest against the U.S. supporting its tool of aggression, Israel.

At the end of June, Syria refused to deal with the American Broadcasting Company.

Sudan cut off all trade relations with Britain on June 28.

According to a recent report by the Middle East News Agency, professors at the University of Khartoum have decided to stop all contact with American and British institutions that use the guise of science and academia to engage in political intrigue, as well as organizations controlled by Zionism.

According to a report by the Karachi Daily News, Pakistani youth Rahim Bakhsh Jatoi began a hunger strike in front of the Soviet Consulate in Karachi on July 1 to protest against the Soviet revisionists' betrayal of the Arab people in the Middle East issue.

The young man held a large portrait of Chairman Mao and sat under a huge banner with slogans such as "Down with U.S.-Soviet collusion." His body was adorned with many wreaths sent by friends to encourage his struggle.

Jatoi denounced the betrayal of the Soviet revisionist leadership against the world's people to the news reporters. He said that the role of the Soviet revisionists in Indonesia, the Dominican Republic, and recently in the Middle East is a serious betrayal of the socialist principles proclaimed by Marx and Lenin.
