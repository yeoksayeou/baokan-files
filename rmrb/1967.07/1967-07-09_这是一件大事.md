This is a Major Event

This year, amidst the unprecedented triumph of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the summer harvest has achieved a bumper yield. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres have actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call of "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." They have rationally increased collective reserve grain and made every effort to manage the collective reserve grain properly.

However, from this letter, we can see that there are two distinctly different attitudes towards managing the reserve grain properly. One attitude is characterized by a high sense of political responsibility, establishing a global perspective of "standing at the doorstep and seeing the whole world." They recognize that managing the reserve grain properly is a major task to realize Chairman Mao's great call, a matter that concerns the revolution of our country and the world revolution. They understand that "grain is the treasure among treasures," and every grain is the fruit of the laboring people's hard work, not a single grain should be wasted. The other attitude is a lack of understanding of the importance of managing the reserve grain properly, lacking the long-term perspective of storing grain, and mistakenly believing that "as long as there is grain in the fields, there is no need to fear rats and mice." They take the preservation of grain lightly, resulting in losses.

Obviously, the latter attitude is wrong and worthy of attention by the revolutionary masses and poor and lower-middle peasants in the countryside.

Currently, it is the time when the summer harvest is about to end, and a new batch of reserve grain is entering the granaries. It is also the rainy season, with high temperatures and humidity. If the grain is not managed properly, it is easy to become moldy and infested with insects, causing the grain to deteriorate. Therefore, all production teams should follow Chairman Mao's teachings of thrift and frugality, seize the opportunity, and thoroughly check the storage conditions of the reserve grain, striving to ensure that not a single grain is damaged.

　　这是一件大事
    今年，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，夏粮获得了大丰收。广大贫农下中农、革命群众和革命干部，积极响应毛主席提出的“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大号召，合理地增加了集体储备粮，尽力管好集体储备粮。
    但是，从这封来信中可以看到，人们对管好储备粮的工作，仍然有两种截然不同的态度：一种是有高度的政治责任感，树立了“站在家门口，看到全世界”的全局观点，认识到管好储备粮，是实现毛主席伟大号召的大事，是关系到我国革命和世界革命的大事；认识到“粮食是宝中之宝”，每一颗粮食都是劳动人民辛勤劳动的果实，一粒也不能糟蹋。另一种态度是对管好储备粮的重要意义认识不足，缺乏长期储粮的思想，错误地认为“只要地里有，不怕虫鼠咬”，对保管粮食漫不经心，造成了损失。
    显然，后一种态度是错误的，很值得农村的无产阶级革命派和贫下中农注意。
    现在正是夏粮收获快要结束的时候，一批新的储备粮正在入仓。目前又是多雨季节，气温高，湿度大，粮食保管不好，很容易发霉生虫，使粮食变质。因此，各地生产队要遵照毛主席勤俭节约的教导，抓紧时机，切实地检查一下储备粮保管情况，努力做到不损坏一粒粮。
