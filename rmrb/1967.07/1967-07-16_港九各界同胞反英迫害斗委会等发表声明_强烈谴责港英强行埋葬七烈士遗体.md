Hong Kong and Kowloon Fellow Countrymen's Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee and the Funeral Committee for the Seven Martyrs Who Died in the Anti-British Struggle issued a joint statement on July 14, strongly condemning the British authorities in Hong Kong for forcibly burying the remains of seven martyrs during the "curfew" period from the night of July 12 to the early morning of July 13, despite repeated protests from the families of the martyrs, including Xu Tianbo.

The statement said that the British authorities in Hong Kong, after repeatedly promising the families of the seven martyrs who died in the struggle that they would not move the remains, committed the heinous act of burying the remains to conceal the evidence just three days later. This has aroused even greater hatred and strong resistance from the patriotic people of Hong Kong and Kowloon.

The statement emphasized that the British fascist authorities in Hong Kong are trying to escape responsibility for the deaths of the martyrs by burying their remains, thinking that this will stop us from holding a funeral for the martyrs. This is absolutely impossible. No matter what methods the British authorities use, we will continue to prepare for the martyrs' funeral and will definitely hold a solemn funeral for the martyrs who died in the anti-British struggle!

    港九各界同胞反英迫害斗委会等发表声明
    强烈谴责港英强行埋葬七烈士遗体
    据新华社香港十五日电　港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会、反英抗暴死难七烈士治丧委员会十四日发表联合声明，强烈谴责港英当局不顾徐田波等七位烈士家属的一再抗议，在十二日晚上至十三日凌晨的“宵禁”期间，悍然把七位烈士的遗体强行埋葬，埋尸灭迹。
    声明说，港英当局在七名抗暴死难烈士家属一再抗议下，曾口头答应绝不移动烈士的遗体，但事隔三天，港英当局竟然干出埋尸灭迹的罪恶勾当，激起了港九爱国同胞更大的仇恨和强烈的反抗。
    声明最后强调说，港英法西斯当局以埋尸灭迹的手段逃避交代烈士的死因，以为这样就可以阻挠我们为死难烈士治丧，这是绝对办不到的。不管港英当局使用什么手法，我们一定要继续筹办烈士的丧事，一定要为反英抗暴的死难烈士举行庄严的丧礼！
