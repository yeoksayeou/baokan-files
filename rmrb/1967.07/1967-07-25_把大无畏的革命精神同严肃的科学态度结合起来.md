Editor's Note: Today, our newspaper publishes the article "Combining the Fearless Revolutionary Spirit with a Serious Scientific Attitude," which is an excellent article worthy of the attention of all comrades in the proletarian revolutionary faction. The author uses the dialectical method of "one divides into two" frequently taught by Chairman Mao to analyze several fundamental issues in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, providing a comprehensive and profound analysis. The article correctly discusses the extreme importance of combining the fearless revolutionary spirit with a serious scientific attitude in the current movement.

Over the past year, the proletarian revolutionary faction on all fronts in our country has raised high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launching a fierce offensive against the most corrupt and reactionary clique of capitalist roaders within the Party. They have exposed the bourgeois headquarters that had long been hidden within our Party, establishing a great merit for the people.

Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has entered the decisive phase of the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads. We must continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, charging forward with swords drawn, to achieve new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

To carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, we must correctly and strictly distinguish between the two headquarters, the two types of power-holders, and the two types of "revolution" and "conservatism." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution we are conducting is a revolution under the leadership of the Party, a revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. The strongest leadership of the Party is the leadership of Chairman Mao, the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought, and the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. To thoroughly overthrow the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, to smash their bourgeois headquarters, we must mobilize hundreds of millions of people from the bottom up, launch a revolutionary great criticism and great struggle; we must resolutely support and protect the proletarian power-holders, resolutely support and defend the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. The reason why anarchist tendencies are reactionary is that they reject and overthrow everything, thus shaking and weakening the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, shaking and weakening the proletarian dictatorship.

To carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, we must correctly combine it with the organizational discipline of the proletariat. The revolutionary struggle of the proletariat is a struggle with a unified class will, and thus the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat and the iron discipline of the proletariat are inseparable. Lenin said well: "We do not need a frenzied wave, we need the orderly march of the proletarian iron army." "Whoever weakens the iron discipline of the proletarian party, even slightly (especially during the period of proletarian dictatorship), is in fact helping the bourgeoisie against the proletariat."

To carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, we must also correctly and strictly distinguish between proletarian revolutionary nature and the vacillating nature of the petty bourgeoisie. We must advocate a firm and correct political direction and a hardworking, down-to-earth work style, opposing the petty-bourgeois thought and actions of vacillating between "left" and "right," seeking personal gain. Only in this way can we correctly understand and faithfully carry out Chairman Mao's theories, lines, principles, and policies on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Comrades in the proletarian revolutionary faction, let us remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "rebellion is justified," further carry forward the fearless revolutionary spirit of the proletariat, and combine it with the serious scientific attitude of the proletariat in both thought and action, raising our struggle to a new level and carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

Combining the fearless revolutionary spirit with a serious scientific attitude is a long-standing teaching of our great leader Chairman Mao, and it is the power of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we, the proletarian revolutionary faction, must shoulder our historical mission, overcome the tenacious enemy, and truly play the role of vanguard and backbone. We must raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, and combine the fearless revolutionary spirit with a serious scientific attitude.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "A thorough materialist is fearless... 'To dare to be beheaded, to dare to pull the emperor off his horse,' we must have this fearless spirit when fighting for socialism and communism." In the fierce struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the primary task of the proletarian revolutionary faction is to be "daring." We must dare to think, dare to speak, dare to rebel. For the revolution, we must dare to climb mountains of knives and cross seas of fire. Without this fearless revolutionary spirit, there can be no revolutionary actions, and we cannot be called revolutionaries.

However, a thorough materialist must necessarily be the most scientific in his approach. In his brilliant work "On Practice," Chairman Mao points out: "Idealism and mechanical materialism, opportunism and adventurism, are characterized by the separation of subjectivity and objectivity, and the detachment of knowledge from practice. The epistemology of Marxism-Leninism, characterized by scientific social practice, must resolutely oppose these erroneous ideas." Chairman Mao also teaches us: "The most sharp and effective weapon of the proletariat is only one, that is, a serious and combative scientific attitude." In this extremely sharp, complex, and profound class struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, if the proletarian revolutionary faction does not combine the fearless revolutionary spirit with a serious scientific attitude, it will not be able to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle and will inevitably go astray.

Vice Chairman Lin, based on Chairman Mao's long-standing teachings, gave the proletarian revolutionary faction the instruction to strengthen the "three natures"—revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline. This deeply embodies the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and is the magic weapon for the proletarian revolutionary faction to defeat the enemy. For the proletarian revolutionary faction, it is as indispensable as clothing, food, and shelter.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, how to combine the fearless revolutionary spirit with a serious scientific attitude and earnestly implement Vice Chairman Lin's instruction to strengthen the "three natures," we have the following rough understandings from our struggle practice:

We must dare to rebel, but also firmly grasp the direction of the struggle

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The thousands of doctrines of Marxism can be summed up in one sentence: 'Rebellion is justified.'" In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we, the proletarian revolutionary faction, follow Chairman Mao's great teachings, raise high the banner of "revolution is not a crime, rebellion is justified," fearing neither encirclement nor intimidation, daring to risk being labeled as "rightists" or "counter-revolutionaries," fiercely attacking the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, overthrowing their rule, exposing their heinous crimes of opposing the Party, opposing socialism, and opposing Mao Zedong Thought, defeating them thoroughly.

Daring to rebel is the main characteristic that distinguishes us, the proletarian revolutionary faction, from the conservatives.

Daring to rebel while firmly grasping the direction of the struggle, always directing the struggle at the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, is the main characteristic that distinguishes us from the anarchists.

Some people say: "As long as you rebel, you are justified." This lacks class analysis. We disagree with this view. When someone deceives the masses, directing the spearhead at the proletarian headquarters, trying to overthrow the proletarian power-holders, we stand up and clarify the facts, resolutely resisting the reverse current.

We do this in accordance with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, acting in a scientific manner. Because when the state power is in the hands of the exploiting classes, the proletariat is still the oppressed class, as long as you rebel, you are justified, as long as you rebel, you are revolutionary, that is correct. However, now our country is a great proletarian dictatorship, the leading role is played by the proletarian headquarters headed by our great leader Chairman Mao and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is carried out under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship and is personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao. The "Sixteen Points" clearly states: The focus of this movement is to criticize and overthrow those within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Vice Chairman Lin also clearly pointed out in his speech on September 15 last year: To attack the headquarters is to attack the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party. It is not allowed to attack the proletarian headquarters.

Since there are two headquarters and two types of power-holders of different natures, there must also be two types of rebellion of different natures, and there is the issue of "rebellion is justified" and "rebellion is not justified." Ignoring this objective reality, not analyzing rebellion from a class perspective, not distinguishing whether it is rebelling against the bourgeois power-holders or "rebelling" against the proletarian power-holders, and generally advocating "as long as you rebel, you are justified" is extremely wrong. For the clique of revisionist counter-revolutionaries and capitalist roaders who have infiltrated the proletarian dictatorship machinery, we must rebel against them, and rebelling against them is completely justified. For the proletarian headquarters and the proletarian power-holders, we must resolutely support them, and rebelling against them is unjustified. For their shortcomings and errors, we must also expose and criticize them, but the purpose is to "punish past mistakes and prevent future ones, to cure the sickness and save the patient," urging them to progress better. This is completely different from rebelling against the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party.

Not analyzing rebellion from a class perspective leads to objectivism. Objectivism is a bourgeois ideology. Those who hold an objectivist stance, in general situations, mostly have problems with their views, and some use objectivism to cover up their bourgeois stance, deceiving the masses. In the Cultural Revolution, they deliberately obscure the class nature of "rebellion is justified," deceiving the masses, using the revolutionary enthusiasm of the masses to attack the proletarian headquarters. Against such people, all true revolutionaries must be highly vigilant and careful, never to be deceived!

In the process of revolutionary rebellion, the proletarian revolutionary faction must insist on the methods of investigation and class analysis, must seriously conduct class analysis of the power-holders, and correctly distinguish between the two types of power-holders of different natures. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In a class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all kinds of thoughts are stamped with the mark of class." Vice Chairman Lin instructs: "Class and class struggle are the root of all phenomena in class society." The method of class analysis is the only correct and scientific method to observe all social phenomena, people, and things, and it is the sharpest and most penetrating weapon to identify ghosts and monsters. Who is a proletarian power-holder? Who is a capitalist roader? Only through in-depth investigation and research, on the basis of abundant materials, using the perspective of class and class struggle to analyze and distinguish, can we see through the phenomena and understand the essence, correctly distinguishing between them.

We must dare to break the revisionist "framework," but also honestly follow the Party's policies

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no movement." The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to thoroughly criticize and overthrow, to criticize and overthrow is revolution, is criticism, is struggle. Criticism first, construction in the middle. This requires us, the proletarian revolutionary faction, to carry forward the spirit of daring to think, dare to speak, and dare to act, daring to break the revisionist policies, disciplines, and "frameworks" of the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party. Without this, we cannot be revolutionary.

This is how we do it. When we struggle against the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, one of their important weapons to deal with us is to steal the name of the Party, distorting the Party's discipline into their reactionary discipline to oppose the revolution and suppress the masses, using countless rules and regulations to bind our hands and feet, not allowing us to rebel. However, we do not fall for their tricks. We break their rules and regulations, expose their conspiracies, and thus, in the eyes of the masses, expose their counter-revolutionary faces. In the struggle, we deeply feel that against all bad elements, against all old things, if you do not fight them, they will fight you; if you do not overthrow them, they will overthrow you. You must not be naive, you must not compromise.

However, we are not suspicious of everything, we do not engage in anarchism. We insist on a scientific attitude, and we must also analyze the so-called "frameworks" from a class perspective. For the policies and "instructions" from the bourgeois headquarters, we must resolutely oppose and resist them; for the policies and instructions from the proletarian headquarters, we must resolutely support and implement them.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party, and all levels of leadership must pay full attention to them, never being careless." We, the proletarian revolutionary faction, listen to Chairman Mao the most. We will never act blindly without the guidance of the Party's policies. The Party's policies are "things that have been scientifically transformed based on practice," they are "things that have reached the whole, the essence, and the internal connections of things." Without the guidance of the Party's policies, we will definitely make rightist or "leftist" mistakes.

The Party's policies are the concentrated expression of the fundamental interests of the proletariat and the working people. They are based on the overall situation, not just on a particular part; they consider long-term interests, not just temporary interests; they meet the demands of the broad masses, not just the demands of a few people. Therefore, in dealing with the Party's policies, we must stand on the proletarian standpoint, with proletarian feelings, to understand and implement them. We must honestly and faithfully implement them, whether we understand them or not, whether they meet our needs or not, whether we are in a difficult position or in a favorable environment. Without this, we cannot have unified revolutionary actions.

The greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, discovered the laws of class struggle in socialist society, solved a series of problems of the proletarian revolution in our time, solved the theoretical and practical problems of revolution under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship and preventing the restoration of capitalism, developing Marxism to a new stage, the stage of Mao Zedong Thought. Chairman Mao personally initiated and led this Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. During the Cultural Revolution, the series of policies, guidelines, instructions, and regulations formulated by the Party Central Committee headed by Chairman Mao are all produced on the basis of practice. They deeply reveal the internal connections and laws of development of the movement, shining with the great light of Mao Zedong Thought. Whether or not we can honestly and faithfully implement them, whether we understand them or not, is an important sign of whether we have established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds.

We honestly follow the Party's policies and observe the Party's discipline. Some people accuse us of being "new slaves." We say, those who should be accused are not us, but them; it is not that we have "new slavery," but that they have anarchism. Not resisting erroneous leadership, not being principled, unconditionally obeying, is slavery, and it must be resolutely opposed. But resisting erroneous leadership and resolutely accepting and implementing the correct leadership of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought are completely consistent. For correct leadership, not only should we not resist, but we should also resolutely obey.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must strengthen discipline education throughout the Party because unified discipline is a necessary condition for revolutionary victory." The proletarian revolutionary faction must smash the reactionary discipline of the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, but at the same time, must consciously observe the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat. If we deny the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat, thinking that everything from above is a "framework" and should be smashed, we will fall into the quagmire of anarchism, doubting everything, rejecting everything, and overthrowing everything.

Anarchism actually has a "government." Not wanting the Party's policies is itself a kind of policy. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Any action of a revolutionary party is the implementation of a policy. It is either the implementation of a correct policy or the implementation of an erroneous policy; it is either the conscious implementation of a certain policy or the unconscious implementation of a certain policy." Those who generally denounce the Party's policies as "frameworks" seem to have no "frameworks," but this is not the case. They do not implement correct policies, but are implementing an erroneous policy. Not implementing the policy of great unity would inevitably implement the policy of civil war; not implementing the policy of "punishing past mistakes and preventing future ones, curing the sickness and saving the patient" for cadres who make mistakes would inevitably implement the policy of kicking them away with one foot and beating them to death with one stick; those who violate the Party's policies to engage in beating, smashing, and looting, beating, smashing, and looting is their policy; those who do not implement the policy of doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, wandering east and west is their policy. Such people seem to have no slavery, but their actions are actually consciously or unconsciously acting according to the bourgeois worldview. They think they are great "heroes," but in fact, they are captives of the bourgeoisie, only pitifully unaware of it!

We must dare to charge into battle, but also be willing to work hard

In the fierce class struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we, the proletarian revolutionary faction, are the vanguard, the backbone, the fearless revolutionary warriors who charge into battle. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an unprecedented great revolution. Many people lack ideological preparation. Especially, the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie thrown out by the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party has caused great obstacles to the movement. Under these circumstances, if the proletarian revolutionary faction is not "daring," not daring to stand up, not daring to take the lead, not daring to be the vanguard, the cover of class struggle cannot be lifted, and the already launched magnificent mass movement will be suppressed.

However, true proletarian revolutionaries are also those who work hard, think deeply, and do not seek fame.

Working hard is not only a necessary quality for the proletarian revolutionary faction but also a necessary condition for achieving victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. This Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution seizes power from the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, not through top-down dismissals and reorganizations, but through the great mass movement from the bottom up. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution can only be a self-liberation of the masses. To overthrow the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, the proletarian revolutionary faction must go through their own hard work and arduous struggle.

The clique of capitalist roaders within the Party has long monopolized important positions. They wave the "red flag" to oppose the red flag, have rich counter-revolutionary experience, and it is not easy to see through them. Even if we see through them, truly overthrowing them is not something that can be done by shouting a few slogans, posting a few posters, or holding a few meetings. We must go through step-by-step, solid struggle, thoroughly exposing their counter-revolutionary crimes, criticizing them deeply and thoroughly from a political, ideological, and theoretical perspective, overthrowing and exposing them, tearing off their masks, and clearing their influence, isolating them to the greatest extent. The phenomena presented in the movement are numerous and complex. If the proletarian revolutionary faction does not know how to think and solve problems, they will be deceived by the phenomena and make various mistakes.

Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is in the decisive phase of the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, launching a great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle against the clique of capitalist roaders within the Party, while also doing a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units. This is a battle of attrition, a more arduous and serious struggle than the previous phase. The deeper the movement goes, the more arduous the tasks, the more we need to emphasize working hard and seriously, the more we need to use our brains, think about problems, and the more we need to strengthen scientific nature.

When we emphasize working hard, some people ridicule us: "You don't look like a rebel!" They say: "This is not the temperament of a rebel!"

We say: True proletarian revolutionaries are not windbaggers. They must be both daring to charge into battle and willing to work hard, and they must have both and be able to combine them well. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Selfishness, laziness, corruption, and windbagging, etc., are the most despicable; while the spirit of selflessness, diligence, self-discipline, and hard work is respectable." Those who only like to "charge into battle" and do not want to work hard, who cannot sit still, who take pride in running around, seem to be "very revolutionary," but in fact, they are only a small-bourgeois enthusiasm. They are eager for extreme "leftist" words and slogans, like to appear with an extreme "leftist" face, seeking fame, seeking position, seeking to make a name for themselves, flashy but empty, opportunistic, sticking their hands here and there, issuing declarations and statements everywhere, and even for personal political capital, not hesitating to beat, smash, and loot, but not willing to put in hard work in the great criticism, not willing to work hard and seriously in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units. These people have done many things that hurt their comrades and pleased their enemies. If we do not be vigilant, they will inevitably go astray. We have always believed that such so-called "rebel temperament" and "rebel temperament" are not worthy of emulation. We sincerely hope that these comrades will quickly awaken and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, becoming true proletarian revolutionaries.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, whether or not we can combine the fearless revolutionary spirit with an honest and serious scientific attitude, ultimately, is a matter of worldview. If you have a proletarian worldview, you will definitely be able to combine the two; if you have a petty-bourgeois worldview, you will inevitably, for a short or long time, drag the tail of small-bourgeois spontaneism, anarchism, windbagging, etc., into the revolutionary ranks. Chairman Mao teaches us: The struggle of the proletariat and revolutionary people to change the world includes the following tasks: changing the objective world and also changing one's subjective world. Recently, Chairman Mao also pointed out to us: We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideas in our ranks to the track of proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must honestly read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, consciously using Mao Zedong Thought to change our worldview, establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds. Truly doing what Chairman Mao says, we do. Those who only agree with Mao Zedong Thought in words but do not intend to implement it, or do not intend to fully implement it, can they say they have an unlimited love, unlimited loyalty, unlimited faith, and unlimited admiration for Mao Zedong Thought? No, absolutely not! True proletarian revolutionaries must always remember Vice Chairman Lin's instructions, study and apply Chairman Mao's works, especially focusing on the "use" of them, constantly overthrowing the non-proletarian thoughts in our minds. Only in this way can we always maintain the revolutionary nature of the proletariat, become truly promising people, truly hopeful people, truly revolutionary people, always revolutionary, revolutionary to the end!

    把大无畏的革命精神同严肃的科学态度结合起来
    空军政治部　红愚公
    编者按　今天本报发表的《把大无畏的革命精神同严肃的科学态度结合起来》，是一篇好文章，值得无产阶级革命派的同志们一读。作者用毛主席经常教导我们的“一分为二”的辩证方法，对无产阶级文化大革命中几个原则的问题，作了全面的、深刻的分析，正确地论述了在当前的运动中，把大无畏的革命精神同严肃的科学态度结合起来的极端重要性。
    一年以来，我国各条战线上的无产阶级革命派高举毛泽东思想的战斗旗帜，大造党内最大的最腐朽的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，挖出了长期隐藏在我们党内的资产阶级司令部。他们为人民建立了伟大的功勋。
    当前，我国无产阶级文化大革命已经进入了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的决战阶段。我们必须继续发扬无产阶级的革命精神，横刀跃马，向前冲杀，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利。
    发扬无产阶级的革命精神，必须正确地、严格地区分两个司令部、两种当权派和两种性质的“革”与“保”。我们进行的这场无产阶级文化大革命，是在党领导下的革命，是在无产阶级专政条件下的革命。党的最坚强的领导，就是毛主席的领导，就是毛泽东思想的领导，就是毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导。要彻底打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，摧毁他们的资产阶级司令部，就必须自下而上地发动亿万群众，展开革命的大批判、大斗争；就必须坚决支持和保护无产阶级的当权派，坚决拥护并捍卫毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部。无政府主义思潮之所以是反动的，就是因为它排斥一切、打倒一切，这样，就会动摇和削弱毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的领导，就会动摇和削弱无产阶级专政。
    发扬无产阶级的革命精神，必须同无产阶级的组织纪律性正确地结合起来。无产阶级的革命斗争是具有阶级统一意志的斗争，因而，无产阶级的革命精神和无产阶级的铁的纪律是不可分割的。列宁说得好：“我们不需要疯狂的热潮，我们需要有无产阶级铁军的整齐步伐。”“谁要是把无产阶级政党的铁的纪律哪怕是稍微削弱一点（特别是在无产阶级专政时期），那他事实上就是在帮助资产阶级，反对无产阶级。”
    发扬无产阶级的革命精神，还必须正确地、严格地区分无产阶级革命性和小资产阶级的摇摆性。要提倡坚定、正确的政治方向和艰苦奋斗、脚踏实地的工作作风，反对那种忽“左”忽右、投机取巧的小资产阶级思想和行动。只有这样，才能正确地领会和不折不扣地执行毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策。
    无产阶级革命派的同志们，让我们牢记毛主席“造反有理”的教导，进一步发扬无产阶级大无畏的革命精神，并且把它和无产阶级的严肃的科学态度，从思想和行动上很好地统一起来、结合起来，把我们的斗争提高到一个新的水平，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    大无畏的革命精神同严肃的科学态度相结合，是我们伟大领袖毛主席历来的教导，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的威力所在。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，我们无产阶级革命派要肩负起自己的历史使命，战胜顽强的敌人，真正起到先锋作用和骨干作用，就必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，把大无畏的革命精神同严肃的科学态度结合起来。
    毛主席教导说：“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的……‘舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马’，我们在为社会主义共产主义而斗争的时候，必须有这种大无畏的精神。”在无产阶级文化大革命两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中，无产阶级革命派首要的是“敢”字当头，敢想、敢说、敢革命，为了革命，刀山敢上，火海敢闯。没有这种大无畏的革命精神，就不可能有革命的行动，也就算不上是革命派。
    但是，彻底的唯物主义者又必然是最照科学态度办事的。毛主席在《实践论》这篇光辉著作中指出：“唯心论和机械唯物论，机会主义和冒险主义，都是以主观和客观相分裂，以认识和实践相脱离为特征的。以科学的社会实践为特征的马克思列宁主义的认识论，不能不坚决反对这些错误思想。”毛主席还教导说：“无产阶级的最尖锐最有效的武器只有一个，那就是严肃的战斗的科学态度。”在无产阶级文化大革命这场极其尖锐、极其复杂、极其深刻的阶级斗争中，无产阶级革命派如果不把大无畏的革命精神同严肃的科学态度结合起来，就不可能紧紧掌握好斗争大方向，并且必然会走到邪路上去。
    林副主席根据毛主席历来教导，对无产阶级革命派所作的加强“三性”——革命性、科学性、组织纪律性的指示，深刻地体现了战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是无产阶级革命派克敌制胜的法宝，对于无产阶级革命派，它是如同布帛菽粟一样地不可以须臾离开的东西。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，如何把大无畏的革命精神同严肃的科学态度结合起来，认真贯彻林副主席加强“三性”的指示，我们在斗争实践中有如下几点粗浅体会：
    既要敢于造反，又要紧紧掌握斗争大方向
    毛主席教导我们：“马克思主义的道理千条万绪，归根结底，就是一句话：‘造反有理。’”在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们无产阶级革命派遵照毛主席的伟大教导，高举“革命无罪，造反有理”的战斗旗帜，不怕围攻、威吓，冒着被打成“右派”、“反革命”的风险，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，革了他们的命，造了他们的反，揭露了他们反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行，把他们打了个落花流水。
    敢于造反，这是我们无产阶级革命派区别于保守派的主要标志。
    敢于造反，同时又紧紧掌握斗争大方向，始终把斗争的矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，这是我们区别于无政府主义者的主要标志。
    有人说：“只要造反就有理。”这是缺乏阶级分析的。我们不同意这种观点。当有人蒙蔽广大群众，把矛头指向无产阶级司令部，要打倒无产阶级当权派的时候，我们挺身而出，说明事实真相，坚决顶住了逆流。
    我们这样做是符合马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的，是照科学态度办事的。因为当国家政权在剥削阶级手里，无产阶级还是被统治阶级的时候，只要造反就有理，只要反上就革命，那是对的。但是，现在我们的国家是伟大的无产阶级专政的国家，起领导作用的是以我们伟大领袖毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部和以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。无产阶级文化大革命是在无产阶级专政条件下进行的，是由我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的。十六条清清楚楚地写着：这次运动的重点是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派。林副主席在去年九月十五日的讲话中也明明白白地指出：炮打司令部，就是炮打一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。不容许炮打无产阶级的司令部。
    既然存在着两个司令部和两种不同性质的当权派，因而也就不能不同时存在两种不同性质的造反，存在“造反有理”和“造反无理”的问题。无视这一客观现实，对造反不作阶级分析，不分是向资产阶级当权派造反，还是向无产阶级当权派“造反”，笼统地提“只要造反就有理”，是极端错误的。对钻进无产阶级专政机构内部的一小撮反革命修正主义分子、一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就是要造他们的反，造他们的反是完全有理的。对无产阶级司令部的人，对无产阶级的当权派，则应当坚决支持，造他们的反是无理的。对于他们的缺点错误固然也要揭发批评，但目的是“惩前毖后，治病救人”，督促他们更好地前进。这同造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反是性质完全不同的两回事。
    对造反不作阶级分析，就陷入了客观主义。客观主义是资产阶级思想体系。持客观主义立场的人，在一般情况下，大多数是认识问题，有的则是以客观主义的形式来掩盖着自己的资产阶级立场，便于欺骗群众。在文化大革命中，他们故意抹杀“造反有理”的阶级性，欺骗群众，利用群众的革命热情，炮打无产阶级的司令部，对这种人，一切真正的革命者都应该高度警惕注意，千万不能上当！
    无产阶级革命派在革命造反的过程中，必须坚持调查研究和阶级分析的方法，必须对当权派认真地进行阶级分析，正确区别两种不同性质的当权派。毛主席教导说：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”林副主席指示：“阶级和阶级斗争是阶级社会所有现象的总的根源。”阶级分析的方法，是观察一切社会现象，观察人，观察事的唯一正确的科学方法，是识别牛鬼蛇神最尖锐、最犀利的武器。谁个是无产阶级当权派？谁个是走资本主义道路当权派？只有通过深入调查研究，在占有丰富材料的基础上，用阶级和阶级斗争的观点去分析、鉴别，才能透过现象，弄清本质，正确地区别开来。
    既要敢于打破修正主义的“框框”，又要老老实实地按党的政策办事
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。无产阶级文化大革命就是要大破大立，破就是革命，就是批判，就是斗争。破字当头，立在其中。这就要求我们无产阶级革命派发扬敢想、敢说、敢闯的精神，敢于打破党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的一切修正主义的政策、纪律的“框框”。不如此，就不能革命。
    我们正是这样干的。我们在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作斗争的时候，他们对付我们的重要武器之一，就是盗用党的名义，把党的纪律歪曲成为他们反对革命、压制群众的反动纪律，用许许多多的条条框框束缚我们的手脚，不准我们起来造反。但是，我们没有吃他们这一套。我们打破了他们的条条框框，戳穿了他们的阴谋诡计，从而在群众中，暴露了他们的反革命嘴脸。在斗争中我们深深体会到，对一切坏家伙，对一切旧的东西，你不斗他，他就斗你，你不打倒他，他就打倒你，绝不能书生气十足，绝不能迁就妥协。
    但是，我们不是怀疑一切，不是搞无政府主义。我们坚持科学态度，对所谓“框框”也要作阶级分析。对来自资产阶级司令部的政策、“指示”，我们要坚决反对，坚决抵制；对于无产阶级司令部的政策、指示，我们则坚决拥护，坚决照办。
    毛主席教导说：“政策和策略是党的生命，各级领导同志务必充分注意，万万不可粗心大意。”我们无产阶级革命派，最听毛主席的话，我们决不脱离党的政策的指导而盲目行动。党的政策是“根据于实践基础而科学地改造过的东西”，是“到达了事物的全体的、本质的、内部联系的东西”。脱离党的政策的指导，我们就一定要犯右的或“左”的错误。
    党的政策，是无产阶级和劳动人民根本利益的集中表现，它是从全局出发，而不是仅仅从某一个局部出发；是考虑到长远的利益，而不是仅仅看到暂时的利益；是合乎广大群众的要求，而不是仅仅合乎某一些人的要求。因此，对待党的政策，必须站在无产阶级立场上，以无产阶级的感情，去理解和执行，必须是老老实实、不折不扣地贯彻执行，理解要执行，不理解也要执行；合乎自己的需要要执行，不合乎自己的需要也要执行；处于困难地位的时候要执行，当自己处在顺利环境的时候也要执行。不如此，就不可能有统一的革命行动。
    当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者、我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，发现了社会主义社会的阶级斗争的规律，解决了当代无产阶级革命的一系列问题，解决了在无产阶级专政条件下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题，把马克思主义发展到一个崭新的阶段，即毛泽东思想阶段。毛主席亲自发动和领导了这次无产阶级文化大革命。文化大革命期间，以毛主席为首的党中央所制订的一系列的方针、政策、指示、规定都是在实践的基础上产生的，它深刻揭示了运动的内部联系和发展的规律，闪烁着伟大的毛泽东思想的光辉。能否老老实实地、不折不扣地执行，理解要执行，不理解也要执行，这是衡量我们头脑里是否树立了毛泽东思想绝对权威的重要标志。
    我们老老实实按党的政策办事，遵守党的纪律，有些人竟指责我们是“新奴隶主义”。我们说，应该受指责的不是我们，而是他们；不是我们有什么“新奴隶主义”，而是他们有无政府主义。对于错误的领导不加抵制，不讲原则，无条件地服从，才是奴隶主义，应当坚决反对。但抵制错误的领导和坚决接受和执行马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的正确领导，是完全一致的。对于正确的领导，不但不应抵制，而且应当坚决服从。
    毛主席教导说：“要在全党加强纪律教育，因为统一纪律，是革命胜利的必要条件。”无产阶级革命派必须粉碎党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反动纪律，同时，必须自觉地遵守无产阶级的革命纪律。如果否认无产阶级的革命纪律，认为只要上面来的就是“框框”，就要统统砸烂，那就陷入了怀疑一切、排斥一切、打倒一切的无政府主义的泥坑。
    无政府主义，实际上是有“政府”的。不要党的政策，本身就是一种政策。毛主席教导说：“一个革命政党的任何行动都是实行政策。不是实行正确的政策，就是实行错误的政策；不是自觉地，就是盲目地实行某种政策。”把党的政策一概斥为“框框”的人，看来似乎他没有什么“框框”，其实不然，他不执行正确的政策，就正在执行着一种错误的政策。不实行大联合的政策就必然执行打内战的政策；对犯错误的干部不实行
  “惩前毖后，治病救人”的政策，就必然实行一脚踢开，一棍子打死的政策；那些违背党的政策搞打、砸、抢的人，打、砸、抢就是他们的政策。那些不执行搞好本单位斗、批、改政策的人，东溜西窜就是他们的政策。这种人好象没有奴隶主义，其实他们的所做所为，正是自觉或不自觉地按着资产阶级世界观办事。他们自以为是了不起的“英雄”，其实是充当了资产阶级的俘虏，只是可怜不自知而已！
    既要敢于冲锋陷阵，又要肯于埋头苦干
    在无产阶级文化大革命的激烈阶级斗争中，我们无产阶级革命派是先锋，是骨干，是冲锋陷阵的大无畏的革命战士。无产阶级文化大革命是史无前例的大革命，许多人缺乏思想准备。特别是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派抛出的资产阶级反动路线，给运动造成了极大的阻力。在这种情况下，无产阶级革命派如果不是“敢”字当头，敢于挺身而出，勇于打头阵，当先锋，就揭不开阶级斗争的盖子，已经开展起来的轰轰烈烈的群众运动还会被压下去。
    但是，真正的无产阶级革命派又是埋头苦干，肯想问题，不出风头的人。
    埋头苦干，不仅是无产阶级革命派必备的品德，而且是夺取无产阶级文化大革命胜利的必要条件。这次无产阶级文化大革命向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权，不是靠自上而下的撤职和改组，而是靠自下而上的伟大的群众运动。无产阶级文化大革命，只能是群众自己解放自己。要打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，无产阶级革命派必须经过自己的埋头苦干，艰苦斗争。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派长期窃踞要职，他们打着“红旗”反红旗，有丰富的反革命经验，要想识破他们并不是容易的事，识破了要真正把他们打倒，也决不是喊几句口号，贴几条标语，开几次会就能办到的。必须经过一步一步的、扎扎实实的斗争，充分地彻底地揭露他们的反革命罪行，从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批深批透，批倒批臭，才能撕下他们的画皮，肃清他们的影响，把他们最大限度地孤立起来。运动过程中呈现的现象千条万绪，错综复杂，无产阶级革命派如果不善于动脑筋，想问题，就会被现象所蒙蔽，犯这样那样的错误。
    当前，无产阶级文化大革命正处在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大决战阶段，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开大揭露、大批判、大斗争，同时结合搞好本单位的斗、批、改。这是一场攻坚战，是比前一阶段更加艰巨、更加严重的斗争。运动越深入，任务越艰巨，越需要强调踏踏实实地埋头苦干，越需要我们善于用脑子，想问题，越需要加强科学性。
    我们强调埋头苦干的时候，有人讥笑我们：“不象个造反派的样子！”说：“这不是造反派的脾气！”
    我们说：真正的无产阶级革命派，不是风头主义者，就是要既敢于冲锋陷阵，又肯于埋头苦干，必须二者兼备，并能够很好地结合起来。毛主席教导我们：“自私自利，消极怠工，贪污腐化，风头主义等等，是最可鄙的；而大公无私，积极努力，克己奉公，埋头苦干的精神，才是可尊敬的。”那种只喜欢“冲锋陷阵”，不愿意埋头苦干的人，屁股坐不下来，以东冲西撞为能事，看起来似乎“非常革命”，其实，只不过是一种小资产阶级的狂热性。他们热中于极“左”的词句和口号，喜欢以极“左”的面孔出现，闹名誉，闹地位，闹出风头，华而不实，投机取巧，这里插一只手，那里伸一只脚，到处发宣言、贴声明，甚至为了捞取个人的政治资本，不惜打、砸、抢，却不肯在大批判上下一番苦功夫，不肯扎扎实实地埋头搞本单位的斗、批、改。这些人干了不少亲痛仇快的事，如果不引起警惕，势必走向反面。对这种所谓“造反派的样子”和
  “造反派的脾气”，我们一向认为是不足取的。我们热情希望这些同志赶快觉悟，按照毛主席的指示办事，做一个真正的无产阶级革命派。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，能不能把大无畏的革命精神同老老实实的科学态度结合起来，归根结底，是个世界观的问题。你是无产阶级的世界观，你就一定能把这两者结合好；你是小资产阶级世界观，你就必然或短或长地拖着盲动主义、无政府主义、风头主义等等小资产阶级的尾巴到革命队伍中来。毛主席教导说：无产阶级和革命人民改造世界的斗争，包括实现下述任务：改造客观世界，也改造自己的主观世界。最近毛主席又向我们指出：必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。我们必须老老实实地读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，自觉地用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观，在自己头脑里树立起毛泽东思想的绝对权威。真正做到毛主席怎样说，我们就怎样做。那种只是口头上赞成毛泽东思想，但是不准备实行之，或不准备完全实行之的人，难道能说他们对毛泽东思想是无限热爱，无限忠诚，无限信仰，无限崇拜吗？不能，绝对不能！真正的无产阶级革命派，一定要牢记林副主席的指示，活学活用毛主席著作，特别要在“用”字上狠下功夫，不断地革自己头脑中非无产阶级思想的命。这样，才能够永远保持无产阶级的革命性，做一个真正有出息的人，真正有希望的人，真正革命的人，永远革命，革命到底！
