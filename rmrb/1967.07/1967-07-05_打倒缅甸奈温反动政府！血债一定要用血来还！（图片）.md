    Overthrow the Ne Win reactionary government in Burma! Blood debts must be repaid in blood!
    Comrades from our embassy in Burma and our diplomatic courier, along with experts aiding Burma, after repelling the attack by Burmese hooligans, remember the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao and are determined to fight imperialism and its running dogs to the end.
    All comrades from our embassy bid farewell to the body of martyr Liu Yi, and together recited the highest directive: "Resolutely decide to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory."
    Personnel from our embassy, in front of the body of our expert aiding Burma, Liu Yi, who was stabbed to death by Burmese hooligans, angrily denounced the fascist atrocities of the Burmese reactionary government to the executive secretary of the Burmese Foreign Ministry, U Ohn Kyin (third from the right), and the director of the first political bureau, U La Htun (fourth from the right). The first person from the right is our diplomatic courier, Comrade Cao Dalin, who was stabbed in four places.
    On June 27, the window display in front of our embassy, which was destroyed by hooligans organized by the Ne Win reactionary government in Burma, featured a picture of "The whole nation studies Chairman Mao's works." The Ne Win reactionary government brazenly violated international norms, sending fully armed troops to surround the Chinese Embassy in Burma, prohibiting embassy personnel from leaving, in order to escalate their heinous anti-China and anti-Chinese activities. This is the weapon and identification of the murderer, Jin Mai, who stabbed our diplomatic courier, Comrade Cao Dalin.

　　打倒缅甸奈温反动政府！血债一定要用血来还！
    我驻缅甸使馆同志和我外交信使及援缅专家在击退缅甸暴徒的袭击后，牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导，决心同帝国主义及其走狗斗争到底。
    我使馆全体同志向刘逸烈士的遗体告别后，齐声朗读最高指示：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    我使馆人员在被缅甸暴徒刺杀而壮烈牺牲的我援缅专家刘逸烈士遗体前，当场向缅甸外交部执行秘书吴翁钦（右三）和第一政治司司长吴拉昂（右四）愤怒斥责缅甸反动政府的法西斯暴行。右起第一人是身受四处刺伤的我外交信使曹达林同志。
    在六月二十七日被缅甸奈温反动政府组织的暴徒捣毁的我使馆门前陈列“全国人民学习毛主席著作”图片的橱窗。奈温反动政府悍然破坏国际关系准则，派全副武装的军队包围中国驻缅甸大使馆，禁止中国使馆人员外出，以便加剧反华排华罪恶勾当。这是刺伤我外交信使曹达林同志的凶手金貌使用的凶器和凶手的证件。
