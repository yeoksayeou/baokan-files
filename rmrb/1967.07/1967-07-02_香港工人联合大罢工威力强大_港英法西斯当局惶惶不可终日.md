	Hong Kong workers' united strike and the joint closure of 63 business units have severely struck the dying British imperialism in Hong Kong, making the Hong Kong British fascist authorities tremble in fear.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 1: The united strike by 50,000 industrial workers and the joint closure of 63 business units in Hong Kong have powerfully struck the dying British imperialism, making the Hong Kong British fascist authorities tremble in fear.

	The united strike by 50,000 industrial workers that began on June 24 has shown tremendous power. Hong Kong, as a traditional transshipment port, is now nearly paralyzed. From June 24 to 29, more than two-thirds of the large foreign ships in Hong Kong's waters were unable to load or unload cargo.

	Due to the extreme chaos in port loading and unloading work, many factories and foreign firms dare not accept short-term orders for the next three months, fearing they cannot deliver the goods on time. Some already accepted orders are also being canceled. Major trading companies are hurriedly chasing after overdue accounts, and the entire import and export industry is in chaos. Foreign trade, known as the lifeblood of Hong Kong's economy, has seen all monopolistic British firms suffer severe blows and lose huge profits. Hong Kong's fiscal revenue and foreign exchange earnings, used to support the British government, have also sharply decreased.

	British-owned enterprises suffering from the strike are currently suffering huge losses. The Star Ferry Company, Dairy Farm, Hong Kong Tramways, Taikoo Dockyard, Whampoa Dockyard, Wing On Company, Kowloon Wharf, and Taikoo Sugar Refinery—these eight British monopolistic enterprises currently have revenues reduced by 70 to 80 percent compared to usual. British capitalists are now restless and helpless.

	The city's transportation has been extremely chaotic in recent days. Despite the Hong Kong British authorities dispatching large numbers of armed police and plainclothes agents to force workers back to work, only about 20 percent of public buses are running in Hong Kong Island, and only about 10 percent in Kowloon.

	Chinese workers in the Hong Kong British institutions of the "Marine Department," "Water Supplies Department," "Post Office," "Public Works Department," and "Urban Services Department" have been on strike since June 10, and these institutions are still in chaos.

	The joint closure of 63 business units in the commercial sector, which began on June 29, has also left the British imperialists in Hong Kong in a state of panic. The streets of Hong Kong and Kowloon are deserted, with market supplies reduced by 90 percent. Most hawkers and meat shops, as well as grocery stores, have closed. The Hong Kong British authorities have sent out large numbers of agents to threaten hawkers to reopen, but they have been met with stern rebuke from patriotic hawkers. When faced with the threats from Hong Kong British agents, the hawkers said: "Even if you point a gun at me, I will not reopen!"

　　香港工人联合大罢工威力强大
    港英法西斯当局惶惶不可终日
    据新华社香港一日电　香港工人的联合大罢工和工商界六十三个单位的联合大罢市，猛烈地打击着垂死的港英帝国主义，使港英法西斯当局惶惶不可终日。
    从六月二十四日开始的五万产业工人联合大罢工表现了强大的威力，香港作为传统性转口港，现在已经近于瘫痪。从二十四日到二十九日，香港海面上的外国大型货轮，有三分之二以上无法装卸货物。
    由于港口起卸工作的极度混乱，许多工厂、洋行都不敢接受三个月内的短期订货单，怕无法如期把货送出，有些已经接受的订货单也要取消。各大商行纷纷加紧追讨欠账，整个进出口行业一片混乱。对外贸易被称为香港经济的血液，所有垄断性的英资商行，目前都因对外贸易受到严重打击而丧失巨额利润。港英的财政收入和用以支持英国政府的外汇收入，也因此而锐减。
    遭受罢工打击的英资企业目前亏蚀甚巨。天星小轮公司、牛奶公司、香港电车公司、太古船坞、黄埔船坞、均益仓、九龙仓和太古车糖厂等八个英资垄断企业，目前收入比平常减少七成到八成。英国资本家现在是坐卧不安，束手无策。
    市内交通这几天以来极为紊乱，港英当局尽管派出大批武装警察和便衣特务，挟持工人去上工，但是，公共汽车在香港岛开出的只有两成左右，九龙开出的只一成多。
    港英机构“海事处”、“水务局”、“邮政局”、“工务局”和“市政卫生局”的中国工人早在六月十日就已罢工，目前这些机构还是一片混乱。
    从六月二十九日开始的工商界六十三个单位联合举行的大罢市，也把港英帝国主义搞得焦头烂额。港九几十个街市，一片冷冷清清，市场供应减少百分之九十，大部分小贩和肉食商店、副食品商店都罢了市。港英派出大批特务到处威胁小贩开业，遭到爱国小贩的严词斥责。小贩面对着威胁他的港英特务说：就是用枪对准我，也决不开业！
