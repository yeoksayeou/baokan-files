The British fascist authorities in Hong Kong, since July 12, have deployed British troops alongside the "riot police" to brutally suppress our patriotic compatriots. Four more of our compatriots have been shot dead by British imperialists. Since May 6, at least fifteen of our patriotic compatriots have been killed by the British in Hong Kong, with the names of two still unidentified.

In the early hours of July 14, the British fascist authorities dispatched a large number of police and military personnel to raid the Hong Kong Shipyard Workers' Union. An employee of the union, He Feng, subsequently went "missing," and it was later confirmed that he had been shot to death by the British authorities. The victim's head bore gunshot wounds, with bullets penetrating both temples. His body was autopsied. The superintendent of the Kowloon City Police Station was forced to admit to He Feng's family that he had been shot and killed by the Hong Kong police.

The other three patriotic compatriots who were martyred were shot dead by British military and police in the Tsuen Wan and Wan Chai districts on July 16. That morning, British fascist thugs rampaged through Tsuen Wan, where a 23-year-old textile worker, Yu Xiuwen, was passing through Sha Tsui Road. He was mowed down by a barrage of submachine gun fire from the British military and police, with bullets piercing his head. He was critically injured and later died despite being rushed to the Tsuen Wan Workers' Medical Clinic for emergency treatment. Simultaneously, British fascist thugs opened fire on the rooftop of a building in Tsuen Wan's Chung On Street, killing another patriotic compatriot.

On the evening of July 16, Hong Kong compatriots fiercely retaliated against British imperialism in the Wan Chai district. The "riot police," enraged and vicious, indiscriminately opened fire on the crowd, killing a young man on the spot. He died after being rushed to the hospital.

The repeated killings of our patriotic compatriots by the British fascist authorities have sparked immense outrage among people from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon. They have resolutely declared: We are determined, fearless of sacrifice, and will definitely redouble our efforts to strike back at the enemy. We will carry this great struggle against British imperialism and violence to the end and vow to achieve final victory.

    港英当局穷凶极恶又杀害我四名同胞
    港九爱国同胞下定决心加倍反击英帝
    据新华社香港二十日电　港英法西斯当局从十二日开始出动英军同“防暴队”一起疯狂镇压我爱国同胞以来，又有四名爱国同胞被英帝国主义所枪杀。从五月六日以来，香港爱国同胞被港英杀害的至少有十五人，其中两人姓名还未查明。
    七月十四日凌晨，港英法西斯当局出动大批军警袭击九龙船坞劳工联合会以后，这个联合会的职员何枫便告“失踪”，后经证实被港英当局枪杀致死。死者头部有枪伤，子弹贯穿两侧太阳穴，遗体曾被解剖。港英“九龙城警署”署长被迫向何枫家人招认，何枫是被港英警察枪杀的。
    另外三名牺牲的爱国同胞，是十六日在荃湾和湾仔地区被港英军警枪杀的。当天凌晨，港英法西斯暴徒在荃湾行凶，一名二十三岁的纱厂工人余秀文行经荃湾沙咀道，被港英军警用密集的卡宾枪扫射，子弹穿过头部，重伤垂危，后经同胞送往荃湾工人医疗所，抢救无效死亡。同时，港英法西斯暴徒又在荃湾众安街向一座楼宇的天台开枪，把一名爱国同胞打死。
    十六日晚上，香港同胞在湾仔地区狠狠反击港英帝国主义，“防暴队”气急败坏，凶性大发，疯狂地向群众开枪射击，一名青年当场被击中，送医院后不治身死。
    港英法西斯当局一再杀害我爱国同胞，激起了港九各界同胞的极大愤怒。他们坚决表示：下定决心，不怕牺牲，一定要加倍反击敌人。把这场伟大的反英抗暴斗争进行到底，誓夺最后胜利。
