The Chinese Embassy in Nepal has resolutely rejected Nepal's Foreign Ministry's unreasonable protest. The Nepalese government must stop anti-China activities. If they allow imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries to run amok in Nepal and even follow them in opposing China, they will surely suffer the consequences.

New China News Agency, July 21st: Kathmandu News: On July 21st, the Chinese Embassy in Nepal sent a note to Nepal's Foreign Ministry, resolutely rejecting Nepal's Foreign Ministry's unreasonable protest against the New China News Agency's report on the anti-China violence that occurred in Kathmandu on July 1st. The note also lodges the strongest protest against the reactionary forces in Nepal for insulting the Chinese people and deliberately undermining Sino-Nepalese friendship.

The note points out: Great socialist China is inviolable; imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries' anti-China actions will surely meet with a bloody end; those who follow them in opposing China will also reap what they sow.

The note states that Nepal's Foreign Ministry's note on July 10th avoids the truth of the recent anti-China violence in Nepal, attempts to shirk responsibility, and denies Nepal's government's agreement and support for this anti-China event. However, facts are indisputable.

The note states that for a long time, the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and Indian reactionaries have been freely carrying out anti-China activities within Nepal's borders, and the Nepalese government has done nothing but watch. Since the Chinese Cultural Revolution, the anti-China activities of imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, as well as Nepal's reactionary forces, have become even more rampant and unbridled. A large number of foreign publications with anti-China content are circulated in Nepal. Nepalese publications also publish a large number of anti-China articles, maliciously slandering China's Cultural Revolution and even publicly insulting the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao. Despite the Chinese Embassy's repeated protests, the Nepalese government has not taken any effective measures to stop these anti-China activities. The note emphasizes that Nepal's government's claim that in Nepal, one country is not allowed to oppose a third country, is actually only allowing imperialists, revisionists, and Nepal's reactionary forces to openly oppose China, while not allowing China to expose and counterattack as necessary and rightful.

The note points out that the anti-China violence on the evening of July 1st was openly planned and directly participated in by U.S. imperialists and Indian reactionaries, and the Nepalese government was not unaware of this beforehand. Before this violence occurred, the Chinese Embassy had repeatedly warned and protested to the Nepalese government, demanding that the Nepalese government immediately take measures to prevent anti-China violence. However, the Nepalese government did not take any measures. What is even more intolerable is that when the rioters had already gathered in front of the Chinese Exhibition Hall to cause trouble, the Chinese Embassy's diplomatic officials and staff repeatedly protested and complained to the responsible person of the exhibition hall and the Bagmati Zone Commissioner. This commissioner not only did not take decisive measures to stop it but also unreasonably criticized the Chinese side. It was under this open encouragement and support that the rioters brazenly insulted the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, tore down the Chinese Exhibition Hall's flags, injured Chinese Embassy personnel, smashed Chinese Embassy, New China News Agency, and Chinese experts' cars, causing this unprecedented serious insult to the Chinese people and violation of the Chinese Embassy's diplomatic privileges.

Based on these series of facts, the Chinese government has reason to believe that this anti-China incident was planned by U.S. imperialists and Indian reactionaries and was agreed upon and supported by the Nepalese government.

The note states that the Nepalese government, in its note, refuses to acknowledge the fact that the Nepalese government supported this violence, strongly protests the New China News Agency's report, and believes that such statements damage the Nepalese government's reputation. The Chinese government resolutely rejects this unreasonable protest. The fact is that the damage to the Nepalese government's reputation is caused by the Nepalese government's own actions, not by the New China News Agency's report. Can the Nepalese government allow anti-China foreign newspapers to be widely circulated in Nepal, condone Nepalese publications to slander and attack China, to the point of the anti-China violence on July 1st, while the New China News Agency has no right to report the above facts and truth to correct public opinion?

The note points out that Nepalese publications continue to spread rumors, slander, and attack China, especially attacking the New China News Agency. The Nepalese government even directly restricts the sale of Chinese publications, confiscates "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and other works by Chairman Mao, threatens bookstores selling Chinese publications and the Sino-Nepalese Friendship Association that maintains Sino-Nepalese friendship, and allows rioters to tear down Chinese pictures from the Sino-Nepalese Friendship Association's exhibition. For these serious anti-China activities that insult the Chinese people and deliberately undermine Sino-Nepalese friendship, the Chinese people cannot but feel great indignation. The Chinese government lodges the strongest protest to the Nepalese government.

The note states that Nepal has repeatedly expressed to the Chinese Ambassador that it wants to maintain Sino-Nepalese friendship. If the Nepalese government is sincere, it must immediately cancel all discriminatory measures against China and stop all anti-China words and deeds on Nepalese territory. If the Nepalese side, disregarding the long-established friendship between the two countries, allows imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries to run amok in Nepal and even follows them in opposing China, then the serious consequences caused by this should be borne by the Nepalese government.

    我驻尼大使馆断然拒绝尼外交部的无理抗议
    尼泊尔政府必须制止反华活动
    如听任帝修反在尼胡作非为甚至追随他们反华必将自食其果
    新华社二十一日讯  加德满都消息：中国驻尼泊尔大使馆二十一日照会尼泊尔外交部，断然拒绝尼泊尔外交部对新华社关于七月一日在加德满都发生反华暴行的报道提出的无理抗议，并对尼泊尔国内的反动势力侮辱中国人民和蓄意破坏中尼友好的严重反华活动，向尼泊尔政府提出最严重的抗议。
    照会指出：伟大的社会主义中国是不可侮的；帝修反的反华一定要碰得头破血流；追随他们反华的人也必将自食其果。
    照会说，尼泊尔外交部七月十日的照会，避而不谈最近在尼泊尔国内发生的反华暴行的真相，企图推卸自己的责任，否认尼泊尔政府同意和支持这次反华事件，但是，事实是不容否认的。
    照会说，长期以来，美帝、苏修和印度反动派在尼泊尔境内恣意进行反华活动，尼泊尔政府一直听之任之。自从中国无产阶级文化大革命以来，帝修反和尼泊尔反动势力的反华活动，就更加猖狂和肆无忌惮。大量的、载有反华内容的外国报刊在尼泊尔境内发行。在尼泊尔出版的报刊也发表了大量的反华文章，恶毒诬蔑中国的文化大革命、甚至公然侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席。尽管中国大使馆多次交涉，尼泊尔政府并未采取任何有效措施制止这些反华活动。照会强调说，尼泊尔政府所谓在尼泊尔不许一国反对第三国，实际上是只许帝修反和尼泊尔国内的反动势力明目张胆地反对中国，而不许中国方面进行必要的和理所当然的揭露和反击。
    照会指出，七月一日晚的反华暴行，美帝国主义和印度反动派都是公开策划和直接参与的，尼泊尔政府事前也不是不知道。在这次暴行发生以前，中国大使馆曾经一再向尼泊尔政府提出警告和交涉，要求尼泊尔政府立即采取措施防止反华暴行，但尼泊尔政府并未采取任何措施。尤其令人不能容忍的是，当暴徒已经聚集在中国展览馆前闹事时，中国大使馆外交官和工作人员一再向展览馆负责人和巴格马蒂大区专员进行交涉和抗议，这位专员不但未采取断然措施加以制止，反而极其无理地对中国方面进行指责。正是在这种公然的纵容和鼓励下，暴徒们放肆地侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席，撕毁中国展览馆彩旗，打伤中国大使馆人员，砸坏中国大使馆、新华社和中国专家的汽车，造成了这次空前严重的侮辱中国人民和侵犯中国大使馆外交特权的反华暴行。根据这一系列事实，中国政府有理由认为，这次反华事件是美帝国主义和印度反动派策划的，是得到尼泊尔政府同意和支持的。
    照会说，尼泊尔政府在来照中拒绝承认关于尼泊尔政府支持这次暴行的事实，对新华社的报道提出强烈抗议，并认为这种说法有损于尼泊尔政府的声誉，中国政府断然拒绝这一无理抗议。事实是，损害尼泊尔政府声誉的是尼泊尔政府自己的言行，而不是新华社的报道。难道尼泊尔政府可以允许反华的外国报纸大量在尼泊尔境内大量发行，纵容尼泊尔报刊诬蔑攻击中国，直至发生七月一日的反华暴行，而新华社却无权将上述事实真相报道出来，以正视听吗？
    照会指出，尼泊尔的报刊至今仍在继续对中国造谣、诬蔑和攻击，特别是攻击新华社。尼泊尔政府甚至直接动手限制出卖中国书刊，没收《毛主席语录》和毛主席的其他著作，威胁出售中国书刊的书店和维护中尼友好的尼中友好协会，纵容暴徒撕毁尼中友协展览的中国图片。对于上述种种侮辱中国人民和蓄意破坏中尼友好的严重反华活动，中国人民不能不感到极大的愤慨。对此中国政府向尼泊尔政府提出最严重的抗议。
    照会说，尼泊尔最近一再向中国大使表示，它要维护尼中友谊，如果尼泊尔政府确有诚意的话，它就必须立即取消一切歧视中国的措施，制止在尼泊尔领土上的一切反华言行。如果尼方不顾中尼两国长期建立起来的友谊，听任帝修反在尼泊尔胡作非为，甚至追随他们一道反华，那么，由此造成的严重后果，应由尼泊尔政府承担一切责任。
