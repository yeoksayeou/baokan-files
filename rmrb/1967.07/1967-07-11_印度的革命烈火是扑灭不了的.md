The revolutionary armed struggle of the peasants in the Darjeeling region of India has frightened the ruling class of Indian landlords and big capitalists and their lackeys. The National Congress Party government in New Delhi has gone into a frenzy, trying to extinguish this peasant revolution, while the so-called "non-National Congress Party" government of West Bengal has followed suit, shouting "resolutely suppress" and sending in large numbers of armed police to massacre the revolutionary peasants.

Throughout history, all reactionary classes in power have always resorted to deception during peaceful times. Especially the bourgeois governments, which will use a set of "freedom," "democracy," and other decorative items to adorn their facades. But when the people truly rise up in revolution and shatter their own chains, the bourgeoisie will raise the butcher's knife, revealing their hideous faces. Marx long ago said that when the rule of the bourgeoisie is threatened, they will replace the republican motto of "liberty, equality, fraternity" with the unmistakable "infantry, cavalry, artillery!" The Indian reactionaries, whether the National Congress Party government or the "non-National Congress Party" government, are no exception.

The so-called "non-National Congress Party" government of West Bengal, in order to extinguish the revolutionary flames in the Darjeeling region, has resorted to both soft and hard tactics, playing all sorts of deceptive and threatening tricks: first, they said they wanted to "negotiate" with the local revolutionary leaders, then they threatened the so-called "rebels" to "surrender within a deadline," and even announced preparations for a fraudulent land distribution. But all these schemes were seen through by the revolutionary peasants. Under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, the revolutionary peasants steadfastly continued their struggle. Thus, the West Bengal government brought out its brutal suppression.

In today's India, the rule of the National Congress Party has already been discredited, so the Indian reactionaries have bought a group of labor traitors and turncoats in some states, playing new tricks and organizing so-called "non-National Congress Party" governments to engage in deception. However, the sharpening of class struggle and the outbreak of armed peasant struggle in the Darjeeling region have quickly exposed these traitors who have just come to power. What "non-National Congress Party" government? It is completely the same as the National Congress Party government. They are all tools of the dictatorship of the Indian big landlords and big capitalists, and they are all executioners who suppress and massacre the people.

Some Indian revisionists who wear the cloak of "Communist" beg for the leftovers from the big landlords and big capitalists, and get a few official positions in the Indian reactionary government. How can they not serve their masters? It is not surprising that they act as the watchdogs of the Indian reactionaries.

However, the peasants of the Darjeeling region want revolution, so they are not afraid of the reactionaries' suppression. They have long been prepared for a protracted armed struggle. Now, the flames of revolution are not only burning in the Darjeeling region but are also spreading to other rural areas in India. The reactionaries' suppression in India can only make the flames of the Indian peasant revolution burn even more fiercely. The reactionaries' throne in India will inevitably collapse in the great storm of the revolution of hundreds of millions of people!

    印度的革命烈火是扑灭不了的
    本报评论员
    印度大吉岭地区农民的革命武装斗争，吓坏了印度大地主大资产阶级统治集团及其奴仆们。新德里的国大党政府暴跳起来，要扑灭这场农民革命的烈火，而所谓“非国大党政府”的西孟加拉邦政府跟着就大叫“坚决镇压”，并且派出大批武装警察去屠杀革命的农民。
    古往今来，一切反动阶级的统治，在平时总要搞些欺骗的东西。尤其是资产阶级政府，更会用一套“自由”、“民主”之类的点缀品来装饰门面。而当人民真正起来革命，打碎自己身上的锁链时，资产阶级就会举起屠刀，露出它的狰狞面目。马克思早就说过，当资产阶级的统治受到威胁时，它们就会把共和国的“自由，平等，博爱”这句格言代以毫不含糊的“步兵，骑兵，炮兵！”印度反动派，无论国大党政府还是“非国大党政府”，都是这样。
    西孟加拉邦的所谓“非国大党政府”为了扑灭大吉岭地区的革命火焰，曾经软硬兼施，玩弄了种种欺骗和恐吓手段：始则说什么要同当地的革命领导人进行“谈判”，继而威胁要所谓“叛乱分子”限期“投案自首”，还宣布准备搞骗人的土地分配。但是，所有这些阴谋诡计都被革命农民识破了。革命的农民在印共革命派的领导下，毫不动摇地坚持斗争。于是，西孟加拉邦政府就把暴力镇压的这一手搬出来了。
    在今日之印度，国大党的统治已经声名狼藉，因此印度反动派就在某些邦内收买了一批工贼和叛徒，搞了新的花招，组织所谓“非国大党政府”，进行招摇撞骗。但是，阶级斗争的尖锐化，大吉岭地区农民武装斗争的爆发，使上台不久的这些工贼和叛徒立即现出了原形。什么“非国大党政府”，同国大党政府完全是一丘之貉。它们都是印度大地主大资产阶级专政的工具，都是镇压人民、屠杀人民的刽子手。
    印度的一些披着“共产党人”外衣的修正主义分子，向大地主大资产阶级乞求残羹剩饭，在印度反动政府中弄到了一官半职，怎么能够不为他们的主子效劳呢？他们充当印度反动派的警犬的角色，这是一点也不奇怪的。
    但是，大吉岭地区的农民既要革命，当然就不怕反动派的镇压。他们早就作了长期武装斗争的准备。现在，革命的怒火不仅在大吉岭地区燃烧，而且正在向印度其它农村地区蔓延。印度反动派的镇压，只能使印度农民革命的烈火越烧越旺。印度反动派的统治宝座，终将在亿万人民革命的大风暴中崩塌下来！
