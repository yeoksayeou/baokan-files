	Rusk Praises Soviet Revisionists' Betrayal, Confirms Khrushchev and Johnson's Global Deal, Emphasizes Further Collaboration with Soviet Revisionists for U.S. Imperialism

	BEIJING, July 20 (Xinhua) — Washington: U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk, after a month of frequent secret talks with Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, said at a press conference on July 19 that the Johnson administration is very satisfied with the Soviet revisionist leadership's active pursuit of a policy of betrayal and surrender. He encouraged the Soviet revisionists to further serve U.S. interests in Vietnam, the Middle East, and other issues.

	Rusk's remarks on the eve of Gromyko's departure confirmed that during the two lengthy discussions between Soviet leader Alexei Kosygin and Johnson in Glasburg in late June, the two sides conducted global secret deals. He said, "Kosygin and Johnson spent nine to ten hours studying the world situation in considerable detail, and they laid out their views to each other quite thoroughly. I think the Glasburg talks were extremely beneficial." He also revealed, "The practical effects of the talks will be seen in the coming weeks and months as we try to reach agreements on specific issues."

	Rusk once again targeted the Soviet revisionist leadership's dream of "Sino-Soviet cooperation to dominate the world," emphasizing that "U.S.-Soviet relations are very important for the overall situation of world peace." He repeatedly stressed that the U.S. will further pull the Soviet revisionists into its service. He said, "We are ready to seek points of agreement with the Soviet Union, whether on small issues like cultural exchange or on major issues like Vietnam or the Middle East. We are ready to sit down with them to discuss issues where we can find ways to reach agreements rather than arguments, and to find ways to reduce the impact of any major disagreements that may exist between us."

	Rusk then, in discussing the Middle East issue, praised the Soviet revisionists' backroom deals with U.S. imperialism, which betrayed the interests of the Arab people. He pointed out with satisfaction, "On the Middle East issue, I think, based on Mr. Kosygin's speech at the United Nations General Assembly and what we understand of their general attitude on this issue, there are several points where we and the Soviet Union agree, although some countries in the region may not agree. For example, the Soviet Union agrees with the existence of Israel; we believe this is quite important." Rusk indicated that the U.S. is not satisfied with this and will further collude with the Soviet revisionists through the United Nations to restrict the self-defense rights of the Arab peoples, forcing the Egyptian people to submit to the blackmail of Israeli aggressors and abandon their sovereignty over the Suez Canal.

	At a time when news of defeats in Vietnam is frequent and the call for "peace talks" is loud in Washington, Rusk once again advocated for "bombing halt to lure peace talks." On one hand, he boasted about the progress in the Vietnam War, claiming that as long as the Vietnamese people insist on their struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation, the war "will continue." On the other hand, he repeated the clichés about "peace talks," saying, "If the other side is ready for peace talks, we will meet them halfway," and as long as the Vietnamese people agree to "gradual de-escalation," "the issue of stopping the bombing is not a serious problem," "we are ready to stop bombing North Vietnam as a step towards peace," and so on. Western media, in reporting that the Johnson administration is planning to play the "bombing halt to lure peace talks" trick again, revealed that Kosygin discussed this issue with Johnson in late June and pointed out that on this issue, Kosygin is Johnson's "most influential advisor."

	Rusk in his remarks viciously attacked the Chinese people who are holding high the banner of world revolution, inciting anti-China sentiment, and encouraging the Burmese reactionaries to further create anti-China incidents; he also viciously attacked China's development of its own nuclear weapons. The U.S. imperialists' extreme favoritism towards the Soviet revisionist leadership, while hating the Chinese people so much, clearly shows that the Soviet revisionists have completely colluded with U.S. imperialism, while the Chinese people's firm stance of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism makes them fear them to death.

    腊斯克对苏修叛卖行径大加赞赏
    证实柯西金同约翰逊曾经进行全球性大交易
    强调将进一步拉拢苏修在各方面为美帝效劳
    新华社二十日讯　华盛顿消息：美国国务卿腊斯克在同苏联外交部长葛罗米柯频繁地密谈了一个月之后，在十九日举行的记者招待会上表示，约翰逊政府对于苏修领导集团积极推行叛卖投降政策感到很满意，并且鼓励苏修在越南和中东等问题上进一步为美国效劳。
    腊斯克在葛罗米柯回国前夕发表的谈话再一次证实，在苏修头目柯西金六月下旬同约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗举行的两次长谈中，双方进行了全球性的秘密交易。他说，柯西金和约翰逊“在九、十个钟头的时间里，相当详细地研究了世界局势”，“彼此相当详尽地摊开了自己的观点”，“我认为葛拉斯堡罗的会谈是极其有益的”。他还透露，“会谈的实际效果将在今后几个星期和几个月中我们设法就具体问题达成协议时表现出来”。
    腊斯克又一次针对苏修领导集团的“苏美合作主宰世界”的迷梦，大谈什么“美苏关系对于世界和平的整个局势是十分重要的”，并且反复强调美国将进一步拉拢苏修为它服务。他说：“我们准备不论在象文化交流，这样的小问题上，还是在越南或中东这样的问题上，都设法寻找同苏联取得一致意见之点”，“我们准备坐下来同他们讨论我们能够找到可以走向取得协议，而不是走向争论的问题，并且寻找使我们在某些重大问题上可能存在的分歧的影响减少的办法”。
    腊斯克接着在谈到中东问题时，对苏修同美帝搞幕后交易，出卖阿拉伯人民利益的卑鄙行径大加赞赏。他满意地指出：“在中东问题上，我认为，根据柯西金先生在联合国大会上的发言和我们所了解的他们在这个问题上的一般态度，有几点是我们和苏联意见一致的，虽然该地区的一些国家可能并不同意，例如，苏联同意以色列的存在；我们设想，这一点是相当重要的。”腊斯克表示，美国并不以此为满足，它还将勾结苏修进一步通过联合国来限制阿拉伯各国人民的自卫权利，迫使阿联人民屈从以色列侵略者的讹诈，放弃行使他们对苏伊士运河的主权。
    在侵越败讯频传、“和谈”之声在华盛顿又甚嚣尘上的时候，腊斯克在谈话中再次鼓吹“停炸诱和”。他一方面打起精神吹嘘美国在侵越战争中“正在向前取得进展”，叫嚷只要越南人民坚持抗美救国斗争，战争“就将继续下去”；另方面，重弹“和谈”滥调，说什么“如果对方准备谈和，我们将走一半以上的路同他们会合”，只要越南人民同意“逐步降级”，“我们停止轰炸的问题不是一个严重问题”，“我们准备以停止对北越的轰炸作为走向和平的一个步骤”等等。西方报刊在报道约翰逊政府正策划再次玩弄“停炸诱和”阴谋时曾经透露，柯西金在六月下旬同约翰逊密谈时，商量过这个问题，并且指出，在这个问题上，柯西金是约翰逊“最有影响的顾问”。
    腊斯克在谈话中恶毒攻击高举世界革命大旗的中国人民，大肆煽动反华，鼓励缅甸反动派进一步制造反华事件；他还恶毒攻击中国发展自己的核武器。美帝国主义对苏修领导集团百般宠爱，而对中国人民如此痛恨，正好说明，苏修已经完全同美帝同流合污，而中国人民坚持反帝反修的革命立场使它们怕得要死。
