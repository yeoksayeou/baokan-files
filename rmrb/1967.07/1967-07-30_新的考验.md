The Yangtze River is boiling. The Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in the Wuhan area is surging forward, breaking waves and advancing victoriously.

Under the warm care of the great leader Chairman Mao, and with the immense support of revolutionary masses across the nation, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Wuhan have resolutely smashed the frenzied counterattacks of the class enemy and achieved great victories. At this crucial moment in the great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the Wuhan garrison, who stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, have stepped forward and fought side by side with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. They have made important contributions to defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and defending Chairman Mao's headquarters.

The leadership of the Wuhan military recently issued a notice acknowledging that they had made mistakes in direction and line in their previous work of supporting the left, and expressed their determination to correct these mistakes. The most important thing at present is to quickly turn this determination into actual action, and resolutely and decisively support the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, without any hesitation or wavering. This is a new test. We hope these comrades will not disappoint the sincere expectations of Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat across the nation.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "What attitude should all Communist Party members who have made ideological and political errors adopt when they are criticized? There are two paths to choose from: one is to correct the errors and become a good Party member; the other is to degenerate and even fall into the counter-revolutionary pit. The latter path does indeed exist, and counter-revolutionaries may be beckoning there!"

Cadres who have made mistakes in their line should seriously examine themselves, rectify their errors, and resolutely and quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and perform new deeds for the people in the struggles to come. If they do not do this, but in reality do not correct their errors, then it will be very dangerous.

Chairman Mao recently instructed: For cadres who have made serious errors, as long as they do not persist in their errors and sincerely correct them, and are forgiven by the broad revolutionary masses, they can still stand up and join the revolutionary ranks. Chairman Mao's concern and leniency towards cadres who have made serious errors, what reason do we have not to face up to our own errors and resolutely correct them?

We judge whether a cadre who has made mistakes in their line has truly returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line by their actual actions. That is, in actual actions, to draw a clear line with the handful of power-holders within the Party and the military who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly expose and criticize their heinous crimes; to draw a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line, thoroughly purge its poison; in actual actions, to unite with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, fight with them, and resolutely support the revolutionary masses of the proletariat!

    新的考验
    长江在沸腾。武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命，正在乘风破浪，胜利前进。
    在伟大领袖毛主席的亲切关怀下，在全国广大革命群众的巨大支援下，武汉地区的无产阶级革命派，坚决粉碎了阶级敌人的疯狂反扑，取得了伟大的胜利。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线大搏斗的关键时刻，武汉驻军紧紧站在毛主席无产阶级革命路线一边的广大指战员，挺身而出，和无产阶级革命派并肩战斗，为保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，保卫毛主席的司令部，作出了重要的贡献。
    武汉部队领导机关最近发出公告，承认前一时期支左工作中犯了方向、路线错误，并表示要坚决改正错误。当前最重要的，就是要把这个决心迅速地变为实际行动，果敢地坚决地支持无产阶级革命派，而不要迟疑动摇。这是一个新的考验。我们希望这些同志，决不要辜负毛主席、林副主席、党中央、中央文革和全国无产阶级革命派的殷切期望。
    毛主席教导我们：“一切犯有思想上和政治上错误的共产党员，在他们受到批评的时候，应当采取什么态度呢？这里有两条可供选择的道路：一条是改正错误，做一个好的党员；一条是堕落下去，甚至跌入反革命坑内。这后一条路是确实存在的，反革命分子可能正在那里招手呢！”
    犯有路线错误的干部，应该认真检查，切实改正，坚决地迅速地回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，在今后的斗争中为人民立新功。如果不是这样，而是在实际上不肯改正，那就很危险了。
    毛主席最近指示：对于犯了严重错误的干部，只要他们不再坚持错误，认真改正，并为广大革命群众所谅解了之后，仍然可以站起来，参加革命行列。毛主席对犯了严重错误的干部这样关怀，这样宽大，我们还有什么理由不正视自己的错误和坚决改正错误呢？
    我们看一个犯了路线错误的干部，是否真正回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，要看实际行动。就是说，从实际行动上和党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界限，彻底揭露和批判他们的滔天罪行；和资产阶级反动路线划清界限，彻底肃清它的流毒；从实际行动上和无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起，坚决支持无产阶级革命派！
                                              （七月三十日）
