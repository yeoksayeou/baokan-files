The group of lackeys raised by the Soviet revisionists, the Tsedenbal revisionist clique, is one of the most enthusiastic performers in the anti-China chorus staged by the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries.

As soon as the Soviet revisionists began attacking China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Mongolian revisionist clique immediately followed suit, barking in unison with their master. They maliciously slandered, claiming that China's "Three Red Banners" led to chaos in the national economy, a slowdown in the pace of industrialization, and a decline in the living standards of the people. They also said that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of the Chinese proletariat had caused incalculable damage to China's socialist construction, and so on. The Soviet master says whatever slander, and the Mongolian lackey parrots it, word for word, all nonsense!

Under the leadership of the Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao, the Chinese people have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and achieved one great victory after another in all fields of industry and agriculture. Since the start of the Cultural Revolution, we revolutionary masses of the proletariat have followed the great teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution, promote production," further promoting the development of our national economy.

The facts prove that the ones who truly caused incalculable damage to the national economy are none other than the Tsedenbal clique themselves. The Mongolian revisionist anti-China clowns, didn't their deputy minister of finance admit with a long face that "Mongolia has failed to complete its construction plans year after year, causing losses to the state"? Didn't their first deputy chairman of the State Planning Commission say with a drooping head that Mongolia's main economic sector, "agriculture and animal husbandry, did not complete the original plan"? The Tsedenbal clique uses a fig leaf to cover up their own shameful deeds, but eagerly spreads lies and slanders to attack others, truly shameful and pathetic!

The Mongolian revisionist clique has long pursued a policy of completely betraying the interests of the Mongolian people, relying on the Soviet revisionists, resulting in the so-called "socialist" Mongolian People's Republic, with a history of over forty years, not even having a decent industry. Even the most ordinary mechanical equipment, steel bars, building materials, and even some simple machine parts have to be imported from the Soviet Union. Yet, the Mongolian revisionist clique shamelessly claims that this is because the Mongolian Party "did not follow the policy of doing what it declared, but followed the policy of mainly developing light industry and food industry based on international labor division." Alright! Pretending to be fat-faced is not going to work. Since you say Mongolia mainly develops light industry and food industry, then we ask, why do you have to import things like shoes, canned goods, cloth, daily necessities, and even children's toys from the Soviet Union? Why do you have to exchange one live sheep from Mongolia for a Soviet-made plastic toy sheep?

Mongolian revisionist anti-China clowns, put away your shoddy lies that deceive the people! In reality, you have completely betrayed the will of the Mongolian people and sold out the interests of the broad Mongolian people. The Soviet revisionists have long treated Mongolia as their colonial appendage. The Tsedenbal clique still shamelessly says this is following the "policy of meeting the needs of socialist countries." In short, this is to meet the needs of Soviet revisionist plunder, truly the face of a lackey.

This Tsedenbal, after auctioning off the property of the Mongolian people, accepted a large amount of so-called loans from the Soviet revisionists. The Soviet revisionists shamelessly exploit the Mongolian people through these so-called loans, and through the loans, completely control and manipulate the economic lifeline of Mongolia, making Mongolia further sink into a Soviet colonial state. While this Mongolian traitor, Tsedenbal, calls the Soviet revisionist colonial policy "selfless aid." What a "selfless aid"! It is this "selfless aid" that has made Mongolia's livestock completely "aided" away; it is this "selfless aid" that makes the Mongolian people forever unable to repay the Soviet revisionists' debts; it is this "selfless aid" that makes Mongolia become a raw material supply base and a market for Soviet revisionist goods.

Chairman Mao pointed out that the most die-hard elements of the reactionaries will never admit their defeat. This is because they not only need to deceive others but also need to deceive themselves, otherwise, they cannot live.

The Mongolian revisionists are precisely these die-hard elements following the Soviet revisionists.

However, the Mongolian people have long seen through the black hearts of the Soviet revisionists and the Mongolian revisionists. Listen to the voices of the Mongolian people! They indignantly ask: "Is Soviet aid to us for friendship or for livestock?" "The Soviet Union has helped Mongolia for forty years, why hasn't it made Mongolia self-reliant, but instead taken away many livestock?" The Mongolian people with a glorious tradition will not tolerate such exploitation and oppression for long. One day, they will rise up to overthrow the Tsedenbal revisionist clique and overthrow the Soviet revisionists.

　　主子与奴才
　　呼和浩特内蒙古师范学院东方红纵队
    苏修豢养的娄罗之一泽登巴尔修正主义集团，在帝修反联合演出的反华大合唱中，可算是最卖劲了。
    苏修一开始攻击中国文化大革命，蒙修集团便紧紧跟上，随着主子的腔调，也汪汪地乱叫起来。他们胡说中国的“三面红旗导致了整个国民经济的混乱、重工业化速度的减缓和人民生活水平的下降。”还说什么中国的无产阶级文化大革命“给中国人民的社会主义建设事业造成了难以估量的损失”，等等。苏修主子怎么造谣，蒙修奴才就怎么学着诽谤，一模一样，都是一派胡言！
    我国人民在中国共产党和毛主席的领导下，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在工农业各条战线上取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。从文化大革命开展以来，我们无产阶级革命派，遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的教导，进一步促进了我国国民经济的发展。
    事实证明，真正使国民经济遭受到不可估量损失的不是别人，正是泽登巴尔集团自己。蒙修反华小丑们，你们的财政部副部长不是哭丧着脸供认：“蒙古连年完不成建筑计划，使国家遭受了损失”么？你们的国家计委第一副主席垂头丧气地说，蒙古国民经济的主要部门——“农牧业没有完成原定计划”。泽登巴尔之流用遮羞布把自己的丑事掩盖起来，却卖力地造谣诬蔑攻击别人，真是可耻，可悲！
    蒙修集团长期以来执行彻底背叛蒙古人民的利益、依赖苏修的卖国政策的结果，使得号称有四十几年历史的“社会主义”的蒙古人民共和国，竟连一点象样的工业都没有。连最普通的机械设备、钢筋、建筑材料，甚至一些简单的机器零件都得依赖苏联进口。而蒙修集团却无耻地把这说成是什么蒙党“没有奉行宣布自己干的政策，而是奉行着根据国际主义劳动分工，主要发展轻工业和食品工业。”好吧！打肿脸充胖子是不行的，你们既然说蒙古主要是发展轻工业和食品工业，那么我们要问为什么连皮鞋、罐头、布匹、日用品、甚至小孩玩具之类的东西也得从苏联进口呢？为什么要用相当于蒙古一只活羊的价格去换取一只苏制的小孩玩具塑料羊呢？
    蒙修反华小丑们，收起你们那套蹩脚的欺骗人民的谎言吧！实际上你们完全违背了蒙古人民的意志，出卖了蒙古广大人民的利益。而苏修早已把蒙古当作自己的殖民地附属国了。泽登巴尔之流还恬不知耻地说这是奉行“满足社会主义各国需要的方针”。说穿了，这正是为了满足苏修掠夺蒙古需要的方针，真是地地道道的奴才嘴脸。
    泽登巴尔这个败家子，把蒙古人民的财产拍卖完了后，又接受了苏修大量所谓贷款。苏修通过所谓贷款，无耻地对蒙古人民进行剥削，同时通过贷款，完全操纵控制了蒙古的经济命脉，使蒙古进一步沦为苏修的殖民地。而泽登巴尔这个蒙古人民的败类，却把苏修的殖民政策，美其名曰“无私的援助”。好一个“无私的援助”！就是这个“无私的援助”，使蒙古的牲畜完全给“援助”走了；就是这个“无私的援助”，使蒙古人民永远还不清苏修的债务；就是这个“无私的援助”，使蒙古沦为苏修的原料供给地和商品的销售市场。
    毛主席指出，反动派的“最死硬分子是永远不会承认他们的失败的。这是因为他们不但需要欺骗别人，也需要欺骗他们自己，不然他们就不能过日子。”
    蒙修就是这种追随苏修的最死硬分子。
    不过，蒙古人民早已看透了苏修和蒙修的黑心。请听听蒙古人民的呼声吧！他们愤慨地问道：“苏联援助我们是为了友谊，还是为了牲畜？”“苏联帮助蒙古四十来年，为什么不但没有使蒙古自力更生，反而拿走了很多牲畜。”具有光荣传统的蒙古人民是决不会长期忍受这种剥削和压迫的，总有一天他们会起来大造泽登巴尔修正主义集团的反，大造苏修的反。
