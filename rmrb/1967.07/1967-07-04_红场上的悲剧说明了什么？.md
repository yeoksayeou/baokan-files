    The recent tragedy on Red Square, just before the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution, saw a man in his sixties, a Soviet citizen, blow himself up with a homemade bomb in front of Lenin's Mausoleum to protest against the revisionist rule of the Soviet revisionist clique. Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk have been vigorously promoting the idea that the Soviet people unanimously support their domestic and foreign policies. The incident on Red Square has given them a resounding slap in the face.

    In front of the Pentagon in Washington, someone once set themselves on fire to protest against the aggressive policies of the U.S. ruling class. In the streets of Saigon, someone once set themselves on fire to condemn the treacherous acts of the South Vietnamese puppet regime. Today, a similar incident has occurred on Red Square in Moscow. Is this not deeply meaningful?

    The Soviet revisionist clique has betrayed the October Revolution, restored capitalism internally, and pursued a policy of capitulation to imperialism and betrayal of the interests of the world's people externally, completely changing the color of socialist Soviet Union. Recently, they have shamelessly acted as the lackeys of U.S. imperialism in the Middle East, betraying the Arab people. The Soviet revisionist clique's actions of bringing disaster to the country and the people naturally arouse the growing discontent of the broad masses of the Soviet people. The tragedy on Red Square is just a reflection of this widespread indignation.

    It is precisely for this reason that the Soviet revisionist clique is greatly alarmed by the death of this ordinary citizen. To cover up the truth of the matter, they hurriedly published a notice in the official mouthpieces *Pravda* and *Izvestia* the next day, announcing that this Lithuanian SSR citizen who committed suicide was a criminal who had attempted to "kill his wife and son with a razor" and was a patient with "severe cerebral arteriosclerosis." In short, the Soviet revisionist clique is trying to portray him as a mentally deranged criminal, claiming that his suicide had no political significance.

    The Soviet revisionist clique's tactics are too crude. They cannot explain, nor can they explain, why such a person would travel thousands of miles to Moscow and end his life in such an unusual manner in front of Lenin's Mausoleum? This can only show that in their eyes, anyone who is dissatisfied with the Soviet revisionist rule is a criminal or mentally ill.

    This is a typical trick of the Soviet revisionist clique. Have they not locked up and persecuted many "dissidents" who oppose them in prisons and mental asylums? This gang of traitors, in order to maintain their revisionist regime, has imposed a brutal bourgeois dictatorship on the Soviet people, turning the Soviet Union into a quasi-fascist state. However, the Soviet people will not tolerate the reactionary rule of the Soviet revisionists for long. The old man's action of committing suicide on Red Square is a passive resistance to the Soviet revisionist clique. As the Soviet people become more and more awakened, they will surely rise up actively to revolt and overthrow the thrones of these scoundrels.

    Chairman Mao has said: "The banner of the October Revolution is invincible, and all fascist forces will inevitably perish." No matter how the Soviet revisionist clique struggles, it will never be able to save itself from its inevitable doom.

### 红场上的悲剧说明了什么？

　　红场上的悲剧说明了什么？
    最近，在十月革命五十周年的前夕，一个六十多岁的苏联公民在莫斯科红场列宁墓前用自制炸弹自杀，以此来对苏修集团的修正主义统治表示抗议。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流竭力宣传苏联人民一致支持他们的国内外政策。红场上发生的事情，给了他们一记响亮的耳光。
    在华盛顿五角大楼门前，曾经有人用自焚来抗议美国统治集团的侵略政策。在西贡的闹市，也曾经有人用自焚来谴责南越傀儡集团的卖国勾当。今天竟在莫斯科的红场上发生类似的事情。这不是十分意味深长的吗？
    苏修集团背叛了十月革命，对内实行资本主义复辟，对外推行投降帝国主义、出卖世界人民利益的政策，使社会主义的苏联完全改变了颜色。最近，他们在中东事件中又无耻地充当美帝国主义的帮凶，叛卖了阿拉伯人民。苏修集团祸国殃民的行径，当然要激起广大苏联人民越来越强烈的不满。红场上发生这样一出五十年来从未有过的悲剧，只是这种广泛的民愤的一个反映罢了。
    也正是由于这个缘故，苏修集团对于这个小民之死，大为着慌。他们为了掩盖这件事情的真相，第二天就赶忙在官方喉舌《真理报》和《消息报》发表一则消息，宣布这位自杀的立陶宛加盟共和国的公民是一个曾经企图“用刮脸刀杀死自己的妻子和儿子”的罪犯，是一个“脑血管严重硬化”的病人。总之，苏修集团竭力把他说成是一个神经不正常的不法之徒，他的自杀是没有任何政治意义的。
    苏修集团的这种手法未免太拙劣了。他们不敢解释，也无法解释，为什么这样一个人，偏偏要不远千里跑到莫斯科来，在列宁墓前用这样一种并非寻常的方式结束自己的生命呢？这只能说明，不满意苏修统治的人，在他们看来就是罪犯或者神经失常。
    这是苏修集团的一种惯用的伎俩。他们不正是把许许多多反对他们的“异己分子”关进监狱和疯人院而加以迫害吗？这伙叛徒为了维护他们的修正主义政权，对苏联人民实行残酷的资产阶级专政，已经把苏联变成为一个变相的法西斯国家。但是，苏联人民是不会长期容忍苏修的反动统治的。在红场上自杀的老人的行动，是对苏修集团的一种消极的反抗。随着苏联人民的日益觉醒，他们一定会积极地起来造反，推翻这些家伙的宝座。
    毛主席说过：“十月革命的旗帜是不可战胜的，而一切法西斯势力则必归于消灭。”苏修集团不管怎样挣扎，也绝对挽救不了他们必然灭亡的命运。
