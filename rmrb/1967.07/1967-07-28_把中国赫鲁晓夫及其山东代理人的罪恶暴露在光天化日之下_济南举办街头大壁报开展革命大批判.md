In the midst of the fervent revolutionary criticism movement, the revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres of Jinan, with deep hatred for China's Khrushchev, have set up numerous large wall newspapers in streets and alleys. These newspapers, composed of sharp and biting articles, poems, ballads, and illustrations, focus on revolutionary criticism. Now, these large wall newspapers have become a powerful weapon for the broad revolutionary masses to strike at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, as well as their agents in Shandong.

The large wall newspapers on the streets of Jinan were initiated by revolutionary youngsters from institutions such as Shandong Medical College. This innovative move was warmly welcomed and highly praised by the broad revolutionary masses, who eagerly followed their example. Soon, revolutionary workers, revolutionary cadres, revolutionary cultural warriors, and neighborhood residents all rushed to set up large wall newspapers for criticism. Now, large wall newspapers for criticism can be seen everywhere in the city, like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. These large wall newspapers all proudly fly the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and with their sharp and penetrating articles and vivid illustrations, they directly target the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, as well as their agents in Shandong. They expose the ugly faces of these individuals who oppose the Party, oppose socialism, and oppose Mao Zedong Thought, under the bright sunlight. After reading columns such as "Thoroughly Smash China's Khrushchev's Revisionist Party Line," "China's Khrushchev is the Chief Culprit in Sabotaging Our Country's Socialist Education Movement in Urban and Rural Areas," and "Look! The Reactionary Face of China's Khrushchev's Agents in Shandong Opposing the Three Red Banners and Promoting Individual Farming," the broad revolutionary masses unanimously say: "The exposure is profound, and the criticism is satisfying!"

The regularly published large wall newspapers for criticism attract people to participate in the revolutionary criticism struggle. Reading street wall newspapers has become an important aspect of the revolutionary masses' participation in the Cultural Revolution. Whenever a new issue of the large wall newspaper is published, many revolutionary masses spread the word and eagerly read it; even at night, the large wall newspapers are brightly lit, and many revolutionary masses gather around them, discussing and copying from the large wall newspapers. For those who cannot read, organizers explain the content of the large wall newspapers to them.

    把中国赫鲁晓夫及其山东代理人的罪恶暴露在光天化日之下
    济南举办街头大壁报开展革命大批判
    据新华社济南二十七日电　在轰轰烈烈的革命大批判运动中，济南市无产阶级革命派和革命群众怀着对中国的赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，在街头巷尾创办很多用尖锐泼辣的文章、诗歌、说唱和图画等形式组成的、以大批判为内容的大壁报。现在，这种大壁报，已经成为广大革命群众迎头痛击党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在山东的代理人的一种有力的战斗武器。
    济南街头的大壁报，是山东医学院等院校的革命小将们带头办起来的。革命小将的这一创举，受到了广大革命群众的欢迎和好评，并且纷纷向他们学习。不久，广大革命工人、革命干部、革命文艺战士和街道居民，也争先恐后地举办了大批判的大壁报。现在，全市大街小巷大批判的大壁报，犹如雨后春笋。这些大批判的大壁报，都高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，一篇篇笔锋犀利的文章，一幅幅刻画深刻的图画，象一支支利箭，直接射向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派及其在山东的代理人，把他们反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的丑恶嘴脸，暴露在光天化日之下。广大革命群众看了《彻底砸烂中国的赫鲁晓夫的修正主义建党路线》、《中国的赫鲁晓夫是破坏我国城乡社会主义教育运动的罪魁祸首》、《看！中国的赫鲁晓夫在山东的代理人反对三面红旗，大刮单干风的反动嘴脸》等专栏后，异口同声地说：“揭得深刻，批得痛快！”
    定期出刊的大批判大壁报，把人们吸引到革命大批判的斗争中来。阅读街头大壁报，已成为革命群众参加文化大革命的一个重要方面。每当一期新大壁报出刊后，许多革命群众就奔走相告，争相阅读；即使是深夜，大壁报前也是灯火通明，许多革命群众围着大壁报，议论大壁报，摘抄大壁报。对不识字的人，就组织人员把大壁报的内容讲给他们听。
