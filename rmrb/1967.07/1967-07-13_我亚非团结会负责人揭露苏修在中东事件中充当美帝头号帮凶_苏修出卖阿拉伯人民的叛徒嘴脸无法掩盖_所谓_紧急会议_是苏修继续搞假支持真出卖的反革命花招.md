According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 12th, recently, the Soviet revisionists manipulated the pseudo Afro-Asian People's Solidarity Organization Secretariat to hold an emergency meeting in Cairo, supposedly to support Arab countries in their struggle against Israeli aggression and imperialism. The leader of the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee issued a statement on this matter, pointing out that this meeting is a clumsy trick played by the Soviet revisionist leadership to cover up their treacherous actions in the Middle East, to deceive the Arab people and people around the world, and to continue their counter-revolutionary line of fake support and real betrayal.

The leader pointed out that the Soviet revisionist leadership has acted as the number one accomplice of American imperialism in the Middle East. Their traitorous face of betraying the Arab people has been fully exposed. At this so-called emergency meeting, the Soviet revisionists not only dared not clearly condemn the American and Israeli aggressors but also vigorously defended the "legitimacy" of Israel, the tool of American aggression, and praised the United Nations. They shamelessly boasted that the Soviet Union had strongly supported the Arab people in the first few hours of the Israeli attack. This is a complete reversal of black and white, and it is despicable to the extreme.

The leader pointed out that the Soviet revisionists are the chief culprits in splitting and destroying the Afro-Asian solidarity movement. In the united front of the Afro-Asian people against American imperialism and its running dogs, the Soviet revisionists, this big accomplice, big saboteur, and big traitor, must not be included. The Afro-Asian people must completely break with the Soviet revisionists, raise the banner of anti-imperialist struggle even higher, and build a new, revolutionary Afro-Asian solidarity movement.

The leader said, the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, taught us: "Who is our enemy? Who is our friend? This is the primary question of the revolution." The Arab people have greatly increased their awareness from this Middle East incident and have further seen that American imperialism is the sworn enemy of the Arab people. Moreover, they have begun to recognize that the Soviet revisionists are false friends of the Arab people and true accomplices of Anglo-American imperialism. The Arab people, through the lessons of blood, will definitely be able to unite with true friends and strike at true enemies. Although the struggle of the Arab people has suffered a temporary setback, it has deepened their hatred for the enemy. The flames of struggle have not been extinguished and will not be extinguished. They will strengthen their unity, continue their struggle, and definitely drive out all the old and new colonialists led by the United States and annihilate the invading aggressors!

The leader of the Chinese Afro-Asian Solidarity Committee finally said, the 700 million Chinese people are the most loyal and reliable friends of the Arab people. We stand firmly and unreservedly on the side of the Arab people. We resolutely support the Arab people's struggle against American and Israeli aggression and resolutely support the struggle of the Palestinian people to liberate their homeland. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China are producing tremendous power, driving the world revolution forward at an even faster pace. The anti-China schemes of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries will not harm us in the slightest. China, as the red fortress of the world revolution, will become even stronger. We will unite with the Arab people, unite with the people of Asia, Africa, and the world, and strive together to overthrow imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries, and struggle for the liberation of mankind.

    我亚非团结会负责人揭露苏修在中东事件中充当美帝头号帮凶
    苏修出卖阿拉伯人民的叛徒嘴脸无法掩盖
    所谓“紧急会议”是苏修继续搞假支持真出卖的反革命花招
    据新华社十二日讯  最近，苏联修正主义者操纵伪亚非人民团结组织书记处在开罗召开了一个所谓“支持阿拉伯国家反对以色列侵略和反对帝国主义斗争紧急会议”，中国亚非团结委员会负责人就此事发表谈话，指出这个会议是苏修领导集团为了掩盖它在中东事件中的叛卖行径，为了欺骗阿拉伯人民和全世界人民，继续推行假支持、真出卖的反革命路线而玩弄的一个拙劣的花招。
    负责人指出，苏修领导集团在中东事件中充当了美帝国主义的头号帮凶，它出卖阿拉伯人民的叛徒嘴脸已经暴露无遗。在这个所谓“紧急会议”上，苏联修正主义者不但不敢明确谴责美以侵略者，而且竭力为美帝的侵略工具以色列“存在”的“合法性”辩护，并大肆吹捧联合国。他们还大言不惭地胡吹什么苏联在以色列进攻的最初几小时，“就大力支持阿拉伯人民”。这真是颠倒黑白，卑鄙无耻到了极点。
    负责人指出，苏联修正主义者是分裂和破坏亚非团结运动的元凶。在亚非人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的统一战线中，决不能包括苏修这个大帮凶、大工贼、大叛徒。亚非人民必须同苏修一刀两断，更高地举起反帝斗争的大旗，建立一个崭新的、革命的亚非团结运动。
    负责人说，中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”阿拉伯人民从这次中东事件中大大提高了觉悟，进一步看清了美帝国主义是阿拉伯人民不共戴天的敌人，而且开始认识到苏修是阿拉伯人民的假朋友，是美英帝国主义的真帮凶。阿拉伯人民通过血的教训，一定能够团结真正的朋友，打击真正的敌人。阿拉伯人民的斗争目前虽然遭到了暂时的挫折，但是更加深了对敌人的仇恨，斗争的火焰没有熄灭也不会熄灭。他们加强团结，再接再厉，坚持斗争，一定能够把以美国为首的新老殖民主义统统赶走，把侵略强盗统统消灭干净！
    中国亚非团结委员会负责人最后说，七亿中国人民是阿拉伯人民最忠实、最可靠的朋友。我们坚定不移地、毫无保留地站在阿拉伯人民一边。我们坚决支持阿拉伯人民反对美、以侵略的斗争，坚决支持巴勒斯坦人民解放祖国的斗争。战无不胜的毛泽东思想和史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命正在产生巨大的威力，推动着世界革命以更快的步伐向前发展。帝、修、反的一切反华勾当都无损于我们一根毫毛。中国作为世界革命的红色堡垒将变得更加强大。我们将同阿拉伯人民团结起来，同亚非及全世界人民团结起来，为打倒帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派，争取人类的解放，而共同奋斗到底。
