	The reactionary Burmese government has continuously committed a series of anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities. Chinese experts assisting in Burma have been unable to work and have been forced to withdraw from the construction sites. The broad masses of Burmese workers actively support the just actions of the Chinese experts.

	New China News Agency, July 6th: Yangon News: Chinese experts participating in Chinese-aided Burmese projects are extremely indignant about the reactionary Burmese government's incitement of mobs to kill Chinese expert Liu Yi and the fascist atrocities of crazed anti-China and anti-Chinese actions.

	The heads of various expert groups have strongly protested to the Burmese side's construction site managers the fascist atrocities of the reactionary Burmese government and strongly protested the reactionary Burmese government's shameless slander against Chinese experts. They solemnly pointed out that due to the reactionary Burmese government's continuous commission of a series of anti-China and anti-Chinese fascist atrocities, which seriously violate the Sino-Burmese economic and technological cooperation agreement, the reactionary Burmese government has unreasonably demanded that Chinese experts concentrate their living areas and dispatched military police to guard them, restricting the freedom of movement of Chinese experts. Chinese experts can no longer continue their work.

	The Chinese experts' solemn stance of condemning the fascist atrocities of the reactionary Burmese government and their just action of stopping work have received the support of the broad masses of Burmese workers. When the Chinese experts stopped work and withdrew from the construction sites, dozens of Burmese workers on some sites escorted the Chinese experts back to their dormitories. Some workers were reluctant to part, weeping bitterly. Many more workers and staff visited the dormitories after work to support the Chinese experts' just action of stopping work.

　　缅甸反动政府连续制造一系列反华排华暴行
　　我援缅专家无法工作被迫撤出工地
　　缅甸广大工人积极支持我专家的正义行动
    新华社六日讯　仰光消息：参加中国援缅工程的中国专家对缅甸反动政府唆使暴徒杀害中国专家刘逸同志、疯狂反华排华的法西斯暴行感到万分愤慨。
    各专家组负责人分别向缅方工地负责人最强烈地抗议缅甸反动政府的法西斯暴行，强烈抗议缅甸反动政府对中国专家的无耻诬蔑。他们严正指出，由于缅甸反动政府连续制造一系列反华排华法西斯暴行，严重破坏中缅经济技术合作协定，缅甸反动政府又无理要求中国专家集中住地，并派军警看守，限制中国专家的行动自由，中国专家已无法继续进行工作。
    中国专家对缅甸反动政府法西斯暴行进行谴责的严正立场和停止工作的正义行动，得到了缅甸广大工人的支持。在中国专家停工撤出工地时，有的工地上的缅甸工人数十人把中国专家送回宿舍，有些工人依依不舍，痛哭流涕。还有许多工人和职员在下工后到宿舍探望中国专家，支持他们停工的正义行动。
