Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's wise policies, the deceived masses are awakening in droves.

The "Million Heroes" organization in Wuhan is crumbling at the grassroots level. The deceived masses have opened their eyes, turned against their former allies, and are angrily exposing and denouncing China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan, as well as the bad leaders within the "Million Heroes." The proletarian revolutionaries warmly welcome the deceived masses back to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

New China News Agency, Wuhan, July 28th — "Being deceived is not a crime, but turning against the deceivers is a merit." In the Wuhan region, the deceived masses within the "Million Heroes" organization, under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's wise policies, are withdrawing from the organization in droves and rising up in rebellion. They declare with revolutionary fervor: We must completely break with the handful of power-holders within the Party and the military who are taking the capitalist road, and with the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. We must learn from the proletarian revolutionaries and fight alongside them, determined to carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in the Wuhan region to the end.

In factories and enterprises throughout the city, those who were once deceived and joined the "Million Heroes" are awakening in droves. The grassroots organizations of the "Million Heroes" in factories and enterprises are rapidly collapsing. The deceived masses are withdrawing from the organization in batches and are writing big-character posters to angrily expose and denounce China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan region, and to expose and denounce the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. Some workers from the Sixth Company of the Hubei Provincial Construction Corporation, who had previously participated in the "Million Heroes," have now opened their eyes and recognized the direction. They are exposing the inner workings of the "Million Heroes" in their unit. The big-character poster boards in the Wuhan Heavy Machinery Plant are filled with declarations of withdrawal from the "Million Heroes" and "rebellion announcements." The proletarian revolutionaries in this factory have done a great deal of political and ideological work for the deceived cadres and masses. They conduct home visits, make individual connections, and patiently persuade the deceived masses to quickly and thoroughly break with the "Million Heroes," recognize the direction, turn against their former allies, and truly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Some deceived cadres and masses say: In the past, we were deceived, coerced, and poisoned by the handful of power-holders within the Party and the military in the Wuhan region who are taking the capitalist road, and by the bad leaders they controlled within the "Million Heroes." This made us fall for their tricks and be fooled. These bad elements are not only the most vicious enemies of the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses, but also the most vicious enemies of us, the deceived masses. Now, everyone is treating us with such enthusiasm; they truly deserve to be called proletarian revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought. In the future, we will firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and on the side of the proletarian revolutionaries. We will resolutely fight, overthrow, and expose the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, and we will make sure they never rise again.

In recent days, some workers from the Wuhan branch of the Yangtze River Navigation Company who had participated in the "Million Heroes" have been writing "rebellion announcements" to declare their complete break with the "Million Heroes" and their return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They say, the Central Committee sent Comrades Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li to the Wuhan region to handle the Cultural Revolution, which is the greatest concern and support from the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Lin Biao for the people of Wuhan. The handful of power-holders within the Party and the military in the Wuhan region who are taking the capitalist road are the most dangerous enemies who have infiltrated our proletarian dictatorship institutions. They have finally revealed their true colors under the great Mao Zedong Thought. We must expose them and overthrow them.

The proletarian revolutionaries in the Wuhan branch of the Yangtze River Navigation Company have been writing big-character posters to warmly welcome the deceived masses who have begun to rebel, back to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The proletarian revolutionaries say, the deceived masses are our class brothers, and they are also victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. We should enthusiastically help, support, and welcome them to rebel. We proletarian revolutionaries will definitely follow the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, do ideological and political work patiently for those deceived masses, unite with them, and firmly direct the struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan region.

The members of the Hubei Provincial Directly Affiliated Organs Liaison Office, who had previously sided with the "Million Heroes," have also issued statements to withdraw or self-dissolve their original organizations. They say, it is the great Mao Zedong Thought that has opened our eyes and made us recognize the ugly face of a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists. They deeply appreciate Chairman Mao for rescuing them from the pit of the bourgeois reactionary line. They are exposing the heinous crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party and the military in the Wuhan region who are taking the capitalist road.

    在毛主席英明政策感召下，受蒙蔽群众纷纷觉醒
    武汉“百万雄师”基层组织土崩瓦解
    受蒙蔽群众擦亮了眼睛，回戈反击，愤怒揭露和控诉中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉的代理人和“百万雄师”中一小撮坏头头无产阶级革命派热烈欢迎受蒙蔽的群众回到毛主席的革命路线上来
    新华社武汉二十八日电　“受蒙蔽无罪，反戈一击有功”。武汉地区“百万雄师”中受蒙蔽的群众，在伟大领袖毛主席英明政策的感召下，纷纷退出这个组织，起来造反。他们满怀革命激情地说：我们一定要同党内军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和“百万雄师”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头彻底决裂，向无产阶级革命派学习，同他们战斗在一起，誓把武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    在全市各个工厂企业里，一时受蒙蔽参加“百万雄师”的群众纷纷觉醒。“百万雄师”在工厂企业中的基层组织，正在迅速土崩瓦解。受蒙蔽的群众成批地退出这个组织，并且纷纷写大字报愤怒揭露和控诉中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人，揭露和控诉“百万雄师”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头。湖北省建筑公司六公司一些参加过“百万雄师”的受蒙蔽的群众，现在擦亮了眼睛，认清了方向，纷纷揭发本单位“百万雄师”的内幕。武汉重型机床厂厂区的大字报栏内，贴了许多表示退出“百万雄师”的声明和“造反公告”。这个厂的无产阶级革命派，对受蒙蔽的干部和群众，进行了大量的政治思想工作。他们进行家庭访问，个别串连，耐心说服受蒙蔽的群众，希望他们迅速地、彻底地同“百万雄师”决裂，认清方向，反戈一击，真正回到毛主席的革命路线上来。一些受蒙蔽的干部和群众说：过去我们受武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其所操纵的“百万雄师”中一小撮坏头头的蒙蔽、胁迫和毒害，使我们受了骗，上了当。这些坏家伙不但是无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众最凶恶的敌人，也是我们受蒙蔽群众最凶恶的敌人。现在，大家这样热情地对待我们，真不愧是用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派。今后，我们坚决站在毛主席革命路线一边，站到无产阶级革命派一边，把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人，把“百万雄师”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头，坚决斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，让他们永世不得翻身。
    长江航运公司驻武汉单位的一些参加“百万雄师”的职工，连日来纷纷写出“造反公告”，表示和“百万雄师”一刀两断，回到毛主席革命路线上来。他们说，党中央派谢富治、王力同志到武汉地区处理文化大革命的问题，是伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志对武汉人民的最大关怀和最大支持。武汉地区一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是钻进我们无产阶级专政机构内部最危险的敌人，他们终于在伟大的毛泽东思想的照妖镜下现了原形。我们一定要把他们揪出来示众，斗倒斗臭。
    长江航运公司驻武汉单位的无产阶级革命派，对开始起来造反的受蒙蔽群众，纷纷写出大字报，热烈欢迎他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来。无产阶级革命派说，受蒙蔽的群众是我们的阶级兄弟，他们也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。我们应该热情地帮助、支持、欢迎他们起来造反。我们无产阶级革命派一定遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，对那些受蒙蔽的群众，耐心进行思想政治工作，团结他们，把斗争矛头牢牢对准中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人。
    原来同“百万雄师”靠在一起的湖北省直属机关联司的成员，也纷纷发表声明，退出或自行解散他们原来的组织。他们说，是伟大的毛泽东思想擦亮了我们的眼睛，使我们认识了一小撮反革命修正主义分子的狰狞面目。他们深深感激毛主席把他们从资产阶级反动路线的火坑中救了出来。他们正在纷纷揭发武汉地区一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行。
