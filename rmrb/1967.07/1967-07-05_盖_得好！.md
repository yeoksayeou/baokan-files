The short story above vividly illustrates the principle of "seeking great unity and preserving minor differences."

In a workshop of a factory, a worker from one combat organization wrote a big-character poster attacking another combat organization. The workers from the other combat organization then wrote a retaliatory big-character poster. The leader of this second combat organization, upon discovering this, persuaded the workers to write big-character posters such as "Down with the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party taking the capitalist road!" and covered up their own retaliatory big-character poster with these.

"Covered well!" This means that we should cover up internal contradictions among the people with class contradictions, cover up internecine warfare among revolutionary organizations with the great criticism of the revolution, and cover up minor differences with great unity! If we do not cover up in this way, and allow "internecine warfare" to develop, we will deviate from the main direction of the struggle; if we do cover up in this way, and do not allow "internecine warfare" to develop, we will grasp the main direction of the struggle.

The principle of "seeking great unity and preserving minor differences" is a fundamental guideline for promoting the great alliance of the revolution and advancing the great criticism of the revolution among revolutionary organizations. All revolutionary organizations must not quibble over the minor differences among themselves, and at the same time must not forget the major differences with the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party. Only by seeking great unity and preserving minor differences can revolutionary organizations concentrate their forces to strike at the main enemy and resolve the problem of major differences between the enemy and us.

All revolutionary organizations should firmly remember the great principle of "seeking great unity and preserving minor differences" and resolutely not engage in internecine warfare with other organizations. If other organizations provoke internecine warfare, we should follow the example in the short story above: "They are wrong, and we must not follow their mistake!" For the sake of common struggle against the enemy, revolutionary organizations should not hesitate to make concessions. Such concessions are not a sign of weakness but a sign of strength, showing that we are firmly upholding the fundamental guideline of "seeking great unity and preserving minor differences," showing that we are determined to fight to the end with the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party. In a word, it shows that we are firm in upholding the main direction and opposing internecine warfare. If someone insists on calling this "weakness," our response is: In order to be strong in upholding the main direction, we are willing to be "weak" in fighting internecine warfare. This is the revolutionary attitude of the proletarian revolutionaries on this issue.

　　“盖”得好！
　　乐天
    上面这个小故事，生动地说明了“求大同，存小异”的道理。
    一个工厂的一个车间，有一个战斗组织的工人写了一条攻击另一个战斗组织的大标语，另一个战斗组织的工人又回了一条针锋相对的大标语。这后一个战斗组织的负责人发现之后，就说服工人写了“打倒党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派”等大标语，把自己那条针锋相对地指向对方的大标语盖上了。
    “盖得好！”这就是要敌我矛盾“盖”过人民内部矛盾，要革命的大批判“盖”过革命组织之间打“内战”，要大同“盖”过小异！不这样“盖”，任“内战”发展下去，就背离了斗争大方向；这样“盖”，不让“内战”发展下去，就掌握了斗争大方向。
    革命组织之间“求大同，存小异”，这是促进革命的大联合，推动革命的大批判的一条基本方针。一切革命组织千万不能斤斤计较彼此之间的“小异”，同时千万不要忘记同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的“大异”。革命组织之间只有“求大同，存小异”，才能集中力量打击主要敌人，解决敌我之间的“大异”问题。
    一切革命组织应该牢牢记住“求大同，存小异”这个大道理，决不同别的组织打“内战”。如果别的组织要挑起“内战”，也应该象上面这个小故事里写的那样，“他们错了，我们决不能跟着错下去”！为了共同对敌，革命组织之间应该不惜退让，这种退让，决不是表示软弱，正是表示坚强，表示我们在坚持“求大同，存小异”这个基本方针上很坚强，表示我们同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派斗争到底的决心很坚强，一句话，表示我们在坚持大方向、反对打“内战”这个根本问题上很坚强。如果硬要说这是“软弱”的话，我们的回答是：为了做坚持大方向的强者，我们甘愿做打“内战”的“弱”者。这才是我们无产阶级革命派在这个问题上的革命态度。
