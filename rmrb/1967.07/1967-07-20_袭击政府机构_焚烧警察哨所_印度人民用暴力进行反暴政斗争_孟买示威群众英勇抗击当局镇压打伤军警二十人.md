Indian citizens in Mumbai, Maharashtra, and some cities in Gujarat have used violence to resist the brutal suppression by the Indian reactionary government in their struggle for survival and against tyranny.

According to the *Indian Times*, over 5,000 residents of Mumbai's suburbs demonstrated in front of the Maharashtra state government building on the 17th, demanding a change in the unreasonable housing rental system. They were brutally suppressed by a large number of police sent by the reactionary government. The demonstrators fought back bravely, using stones as weapons and throwing them at the police, injuring twenty officers and policemen.

In the Solapur region of Gujarat, the people of Bhavnagar and other cities used violence to counter the Indian reactionary government's savage suppression of students on the 10th. Demonstrators in these cities burned police outposts and post offices on the 14th and attacked treasuries. On the 15th, about 10,000 demonstrators in Bhavnagar attacked the central and state government offices and treasuries with stones.

In Mahuva, approximately 2,000 demonstrators set fire to a police outpost and a post office. They also attacked the main police station with stones.

In Bhavnagar, Mahuva, and Palitana, general strikes were held on the 15th to protest the reactionary government's use of police to open fire on demonstrating students in Mahuva.

The demonstrators fought back against police suppression with violence, injuring about ten policemen.
