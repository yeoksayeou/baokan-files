Currently, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in our area are, with the boundless enthusiasm unleashed by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, meticulously managing the autumn crops in the fields. However, there are some production teams where, due to differing views among the masses' organizations, field management has been affected. Some members of certain masses' organizations, because their views differ from those of the team leaders, refuse to do the farm work assigned by the leaders. They do not water the fields on time when they should, and they only superficially hoe the fields when they should be deeply hoeing. Some production teams have not timely controlled cotton pests. In particular, in some production teams, class enemies have taken advantage of the disputes between the two factions to create chaos and sabotage, causing losses to the current production.

As the saying goes, "One weeding in autumn ensures a good harvest." Strengthening the management of autumn crops is a crucial link in securing a bumper harvest for the whole year. All revolutionary organizations in the countryside, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, and revolutionary cadres must not fall for the tricks of the class enemies. They must not let differing views lead to endless disputes that affect production. They should study Chairman Mao's works well, combine revolution with production, strictly observe labor discipline, work on production during the day, and engage in revolution at night, and do a good job in managing the autumn crops in the fields to strive for an even greater harvest of autumn grains.

    团结一致搞好秋田管理
    当前，我们这里的广大贫下中农和无产阶级革命派，正以无产阶级文化大革命中焕发出来的冲天干劲，精细地进行着秋季作物的田间管理。但是，也有一些生产队，因为群众组织之间观点不同，影响了田间管理。有的群众组织的社员，因为和队长的观点不同，就不去干队长安排的农活，该浇水的不按时浇水，该深锄的也浅搂一遍就完事。个别生产队棉花虫害也没有及时防治。特别是在有的生产队，阶级敌人趁两派争论之机，制造混乱，进行破坏，给当前生产带来了损失。
    俗话说：“秋收一张锄”，切实加强秋田管理，是争取全年农业丰收的关键一环。农村各革命组织、广大贫下中农和革命干部，千万不要上阶级敌人的当，不能因为观点一时不统一，便争论不休，影响生产。应该好好学习毛主席著作，抓革命、促生产，严格遵守劳动纪律，做到白天搞生产，晚上闹革命，切实搞好秋季作物的田间管理，力争秋粮的更大丰收。
