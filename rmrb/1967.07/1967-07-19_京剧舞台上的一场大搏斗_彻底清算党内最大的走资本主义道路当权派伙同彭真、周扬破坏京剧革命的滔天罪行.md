The top capitalist-roader within the Party is the biggest obstacle to the Peking opera revolution. To sabotage the Peking opera revolution, he personally took the lead, summoning all counter-revolutionary forces to engage in a life-and-death struggle with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. The Peking opera revolution is a thrilling class struggle.

I

The top capitalist-roader within the Party, to sabotage the Peking opera revolution, first directed his attacks at the proletarian headquarters that initiated this Peking opera revolutionary movement. He incited his henchmen and thugs to use administrative power to suppress, attack, and besiege the vanguard warriors of the drama revolution, fiercely resisting and opposing the proletarian revolutionary literary line. He openly defied Chairman Mao's important directives on literary work, shouting that the words of central leaders are not necessarily correct, "and can be ignored," inciting reactionary forces in the drama world to defy the Party Central Committee's correct leadership. The head of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique in the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee, Peng Zhen, following his master's orders, put on a fierce face, berating the vanguard warriors of the drama revolution as "making trouble" and "interfering recklessly," calling on reactionary forces in the drama world to "resist the wind." The head of the literary and artistic black line, Zhou Yang, maliciously slandered revolutionary drama workers as "unworthy descendants," cursing the Peking opera revolution as "reckless," inciting the landlord and bourgeoisie not to heed the "prohibition" of the "officials," openly declaring, "You criticize, I perform," brazenly backing the ghosts and monsters in the drama world. This thoroughly reactionary fellow grossly slandered the Party's leadership of literary work as "blind politically and covered artistically," arrogantly claiming to carry out a "commandism" against "commandism," issuing an order not to prohibit performances.

The Peking opera revolution is the great beginning of the proletarian cultural revolution in our country. The top capitalist-roader within the Party felt that a revolutionary storm was about to come from the great revolution on the entire Peking opera stage. Therefore, they gnashed their teeth in opposition to the proletarian headquarters that initiated and led the Peking opera revolutionary movement, desperately suppressing and attacking the vanguard warriors and flag bearers of the revolution who bravely charged the stubborn fortresses of old Peking opera, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to save their doomed fate and block the historical torrent of the proletarian cultural revolution.

II

To oppose the Peking opera revolution, the top capitalist-roader within the Party shamelessly distorted the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," allowing only poisonous weeds to grow and not allowing fragrant flowers to bloom, issuing passes for ghosts and monsters to appear in large numbers. In this regard, they used all kinds of tricks, spreading a series of reactionary fallacies:

(1) To sabotage the Peking opera revolution, they put forward the extremely false slogan of "walking on two legs" (sometimes "three legs"). The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously advocated that old and new dramas, traditional and modern themes should coexist. His agent in the literary and artistic world also shouted that these "two legs" should be "simultaneously promoted," "neither should be neglected," and "do not emphasize which is primary." In short, they wanted old and new dramas to share the stage, stand on equal footing, coexist peacefully, and not interfere with each other! The issue is clear: one propagates feudalism and capitalist ideology, cheering for capitalism; the other propagates socialist and communist ideology, cheering for socialism. How can these "two legs" coexist and cooperate? Is this just a simple matter of "two legs"? No, a thousand times no, ten thousand times no. This so-called "two legs" represents the sharp struggle between two lines, two roads, and two classes: one leg wants to leap forward to communism; the other leg wants to retreat to a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society. There is no room for compromise here. Their "two legs walking" is merely an attempt to protect and develop old Peking opera, exclude and oppose modern revolutionary Peking opera, and through "coexistence," expand the territory of capitalism and shrink the territory of socialism, ultimately "swallowing up" and "melting away" the entire socialist literary stage and literary troops. They put on a smiling face on the surface, hypocritically saying they want "two legs walking," but behind the scenes, they are wielding knives, trying to chop off revolutionary modern dramas in one stroke. What a vicious plot! They opened green lights, abolished "prohibition orders," and issued passes, allowing emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, ghosts, and monsters to continue ruling the literary stage, just as the head of the literary and artistic black line admitted, he wanted to keep these poisonous weeds "retained until the socialist and communist era," to "affirm them, and perform them generation after generation." Look, how arrogant their counter-revolutionary spirit is!

(2) Just as the Peking opera revolution was making great strides forward, with the momentum of a thousand crags tumbling down, advancing towards the old Peking opera stronghold of counter-revolutionary restoration, the top capitalist-roader within the Party rushed out to block the way. He appeared in the guise of opposing the "left," pretending to care about the Peking opera revolution, saying things like "don't rush," "don't force the issue," "let it ripen naturally, and things will fall into place" and so on, endlessly. The top capitalist-roader within the Party used these tricks, merely wanting to maintain their counter-revolutionary revisionist rule intact. Their so-called "don't rush," "don't force the issue," "let it ripen naturally, and things will fall into place" are all shields they use to oppose the Peking opera revolution. Ask, emperors, generals, scholars, and beauties have long occupied the socialist Peking opera stage, history has been so distorted, why don't you "rush"? Towards the just-sprouting modern revolutionary Peking operas like "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," why do you gnash your teeth and impatiently want to strangle them in the cradle? It is clear that you are not against "forcing the issue" but against "having children." What "ripening naturally"? Before the melon ripens, you chop it down, what "falling into place"? You indeed built a "channel," but not to drain water, but to build a dam to block the torrent of the Peking opera revolution.

(3) The top capitalist-roader within the Party, under pressure from the situation and the pressure from above from the proletarian headquarters and the strong demand from the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers below, played a new trick, adopting a retreat-to-advance counter-revolutionary strategy. Facing the great torrent of the Peking opera revolution, the counter-revolutionary revisionist Peng Zhen first sensed that it was impossible to resist, so he changed his tune, hypocritically saying, "You can put those old dramas aside for a while recently, and concentrate on breaking through the modern drama barrier, which is better." He wanted to avoid a short-term loss to seek long-term survival. Note that he only said "put aside for a while," hiding murderous intent behind "for a while," they wanted to make a comeback. In fact, their evil activities of promoting "old dramas" and opposing modern dramas have not "put aside for a while," but have intensified. These two-faced, smooth-talking fellows sang the tune of "putting aside for a while" merely to find a shield in the face of the red storm of the Peking opera revolution, to hide from the wind, to gain time, and once the opportunity is ripe, to counterattack and settle old scores, letting emperors, generals, scholars, beauties, ghosts, and monsters return to the stage, seizing our power. We must peel off their "sugar-coated" support for the Peking opera revolution and expose their "cannonballs" of opposing the Peking opera revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

(4) They also emphasized the so-called characteristics of Peking opera as a reason to oppose the Peking opera revolution. They racked their brains to set the tone, draw circles, and set frames, creating all kinds of rules and regulations to obstruct the Peking opera revolution. The top capitalist-roader within the Party said, "Peking opera has a high artistic level and should not be underestimated or changed recklessly," and also said, "when changing a play, change it slightly if it is harmful, and do not change it if it is not harmful." This cannot be touched, that cannot be touched, just not allowing the proletarian revolutionaries to revolutionize, trying to tie the hands of the proletarian revolutionaries, using their frames to box in the proletarian revolutionaries, what a vicious plot. They also maliciously emphasized that "Peking opera belongs to Peking," emphasizing the formal characteristics of Peking opera to oppose the Peking opera revolution, saying that "Peking opera is suitable for portraying emperors and generals," while portraying modern life became a "four-not-like." They maliciously mocked modern revolutionary Peking opera as "plain water" and "spoken drama with singing." Comrade Jiang Qing, with her revolutionary enthusiasm for nurturing new things, strongly refuted the various reactionary fallacies of a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists who maliciously slandered modern revolutionary Peking opera. She said so well: "These people are simply ignorant! What's wrong with plain water? With plain water, you can brew tea and make wine. Without plain water, you can't even live. What's wrong with 'spoken drama with singing'? Peking opera has always been spoken drama with singing. If you don't speak and sing, where is the play?" In addition, a small group of capitalist-roaders within the Party also said that after the Peking opera revolution, "some people don't like it." We must ask: who are you talking about? Are they workers, peasants, and soldiers? No, workers, peasants, and soldiers love modern revolutionary Peking opera the most. You are talking about the remnants of the old society, the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. You love what they love and hate what they hate, fully exposing your reactionary stance.

In summary, the top capitalist-roader within the Party, to sabotage the Peking opera revolution and block the torrent of the proletarian cultural revolution from surging forward, created various "theories," fabricated various "reasons," and used various tricks and counter-revolutionary two-faced tactics. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "The representatives of various exploiting classes, when they are in an unfavorable situation, in order to protect their current survival and benefit their future development, often adopt the strategy of attacking to defend themselves. ... In short, they are always studying strategies to deal with us, 'observing the direction,' seeking to succeed. Sometimes they will 'play dead and lie down,' waiting for the opportunity to 'counterattack.' They have long-term experience in class struggle, and they will engage in various forms of struggle—legal and illegal struggles. We revolutionary party members must understand their tricks, study their strategies to defeat them. We must not be too bookish and simplify the complex class struggle."

III

The revolutionary tide is unstoppable. Under the leadership of Comrade Jiang Qing, the vanguard of the proletarian revolution in the Peking opera world bravely broke through the barriers blocking the Peking opera revolution, smashed the counter-revolutionary revisionist prison, and planted the victorious flag of the proletariat on this most stubborn counter-revolutionary fortress of Peking opera.

The eight revolutionary model operas personally cultivated by Comrade Jiang Qing, including "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," are the artistic gems of our proletariat. The appearance of these revolutionary model operas not only powerfully refuted the various reactionary fallacies of the top capitalist-roader within the Party in sabotaging the Peking opera revolution in creative practice, but also made modern revolutionary Peking opera stand firmly on the Peking opera stage. It is particularly important to emphasize that the Peking opera revolution seized the stage of Peking opera for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, and set a brilliant example and created successful experience for the proletarian revolutionaries to seize the stage of literature and art, which has universal guiding significance for the struggle to seize power in the cultural and ideological departments. This is what the enemy fears the most. Therefore, they desperately oppose it, trying to diminish its significance and reduce its influence. Their first move is like an ostrich, adopting a policy of non-recognition. The backer of the "San Jia Village" anti-party clique, Peng Zhen, barked, "I am the five-person group," "I don't know what a revolutionary model opera is." But denial cannot deny, so they incited and supported the conservative and reactionary forces in the Peking opera world to join forces, raising the banner of rehearsing model operas to sabotage revolutionary model operas. Just as Comrade Jiang Qing was following Chairman Mao's directive to emphasize the role of armed struggle, leading revolutionary Peking opera workers to further revise the Peking opera model opera "Shajiabang," the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the old Beijing Municipal Party Committee instructed a certain Peking opera troupe to do their own thing, attempting to use their revisionist black goods to revise "Shajiabang," openly opposing Chairman Mao's important directive and singing a different tune from Comrade Jiang Qing. They did this to raise a black flag to offset the great influence of the revolutionary model operas, causing disruption and sabotage.

Their other move to sabotage the revolutionary model operas is to launch a psychological war, using infiltration tactics to try to lead the revolutionary model operas astray. When rehearsing the revolutionary modern Peking opera "The Harbor," the top capitalist-roader in China personally took the lead, spouting nonsense, slandering Shanghai dock workers with a revolutionary fighting tradition as selfish and humble "little people," muddle-headed "fools," and "mob." Under his reactionary guidance, the entire play did not sing the praises of heroic figures but focused on "intermediate figures," letting a backward youth vent his grievances, talk nonsense, and express his dissatisfaction and discontent with the socialist system on the socialist stage, saying that "those with aspirations fail in the end." The top capitalist-roader in China attempted to turn the Peking opera "The Harbor" into a tool for cultivating bourgeois successors and restoring capitalism.

Another trick of a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists to oppose revolutionary Peking opera model operas is to carefully distort and defame the images of heroic figures. In handling the "struggle on the execution ground" scene in "The Red Lantern," they deliberately let Yataro take Mei's father and grandmother down to be executed, using sound effects to create a terrifying atmosphere, putting Mei in a state of severe spiritual split between "protecting her father and grandmother" and "protecting the secret code." This artistic treatment is actually the artistic expression of the reactionary fallacy that "heroic figures will have three minutes of wavering in desperate situations," greatly distorting the sublime spiritual image of heroic figures. When rehearsing the revolutionary model opera "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," they vigorously advocated emphasizing Yang Zhirong's "brash, rough, and wild," that is, the so-called "gangster-like," "bandit-like," wanting to write Yang Zhirong as "more like a bandit than a bandit." In short, they did their utmost to defame, distort, and slander, trying every means to blacken the faces of heroic figures. In addition, when depicting scenes of struggle against the enemy, they deliberately exaggerated the arrogance of negative figures, boosting the morale of the reactionaries and demoralizing the revolutionaries; when depicting people's war and portraying heroic figures in situations of enemy strength and our weakness, they deliberately did not portray the justice and bright future of people's war, opposed emphasizing the revolutionary firmness and tenacity of heroic figures, opposed emphasizing their daring to defy everything and conquer everything, their revolutionary heroism and revolutionary optimism, but instead focused on depicting the terror and suffering of war, spreading pacifism and capitulationism, advocating the philosophy of traitors; when depicting underground struggle themes, they often led modern revolutionary Peking opera to the wrong path of "plot plays" and "thriller plays." They once altered the themes of "Shajiabang," "The Red Lantern," and "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," trying to cover up and weaken the ideological and revolutionary significance of the works, trying every means to lead them astray.

Why did the top capitalist-roader within the Party go to such lengths to oppose the Peking opera revolution?

The top capitalist-roader within the Party and his agents in the literary and artistic world, relying on their counter-revolutionary experience, knew that it was very difficult to openly oppose the dictatorship of the proletariat under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat, so they often used detours and curves, seeking help from the past, using the costumes and language of ancient people to engage in anti-party and anti-socialist criminal activities. They let the dead perform on stage and speak, merely wanting to use the dead as a trumpet for their political ideals, passionately cheering for the restoration of capitalism; they wanted to infuse their own life into the dead, merely wanting to borrow the corpse of feudalism to restore the soul of capitalism. Corpses are just empty shells, while the soul is their own.

However, since they want to counter-revolution, it is very difficult to do so in a very hidden way. A small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the literary and artistic world often used a large number of bad plays recommended by the number one conspirator within the Party, such as "The Dragon Plays with the Phoenix," to poison the masses and numb the revolutionary consciousness of the people; when they thought the situation was favorable, they tore off their disguises, went into battle bare-chested, and threw out "ghost plays," "traitor plays," "wrongful imprisonment plays," "demotion plays," "reversal plays," "curse the emperor plays," and other plays with the sharpest blades and the greatest poison, brazenly attacking the socialist system and the dictatorship of the proletariat, directly aiming at the proletarian headquarters. Plays like "Hai Rui Dismissed from Office," "Xie Yaohuan," "Li Huiming," "Yu Qian," "Four Generals Visit Their Mother," "Village of Ferocious Tigers," "Catching the Tiger Alive," "Qianlong Travels South," and so on, are all big poisonous weeds against the Party and socialism. One Hai Rui is dismissed from office, one Li Huiming curses loudly, one Xie Yaohuan cries out in wrongful imprisonment, one Yu Qian holds a sword with killing intent... all are poisonous daggers aimed at the dictatorship of the proletariat, aimed at the proletarian headquarters. When talking about the Hai Rui play, the head of the literary and artistic black line, Zhou Yang, did not hide his true colors, saying, "Hai Rui is a person who insists on principles and dares to fight," he dares to "curse the emperor," "oppose the emperor's evil deeds," and the spirit of cursing the emperor is commendable, and he brazenly incited, saying, "Some people now have small courage, criticism is limited to section chief-level cadres, and they dare not go any higher." Truly hideous and exposed. What do they really want to do? Isn't it very clear?

The top capitalist-roader within the Party said that "performing old plays will not destroy the country." This is all nonsense. They advocate performing old plays precisely to perform away the socialist country and perform a capitalist country. We must never lose vigilance and be complacent. The wheel of history cannot be stopped, socialism must replace capitalism, and the red flag of communism must be hoisted all over the world. Thunder opens the new world, and the east wind sweeps away the remnants of the clouds. Let those who block the Peking opera revolution go to hell with the dead!

    京剧舞台上的一场大搏斗
    ——彻底清算党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派伙同彭真、周扬破坏京剧革命的滔天罪行
    首都批判资产阶级反动学术“权威”联络委员会
    中国的赫鲁晓夫是京剧革命的最大的拦路虎。为了破坏京剧革命，他亲自出马，呼风唤雨，调动一切反革命力量，同无产阶级革命派展开殊死搏斗。京剧革命是一场惊心动魄的阶级斗争。
    一
  　党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为了破坏京剧革命，首先把矛头指向发动这场京剧革命运动的无产阶级司令部。他唆使他手下的党羽和打手，凭借行政力量，压制、打击、围攻戏剧革命的先锋战士，下死力地抵制、抗拒、反对无产阶级革命的文艺路线。他公然对抗毛主席对文艺工作的重要指示，叫嚷什么中央负责同志的话不一定完全正确，“可以不听”，煽动戏剧界的反动势力对抗党中央的正确领导。旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团的头目彭真遵照他主子的意旨，摆出一副活阎王的凶相，训斥戏剧革命的先锋战士是“为非做歹”，“乱干涉一气”，号召戏剧界的反革命势力起来“顶风”。文艺黑线的头目周扬恶毒地污蔑革命的戏剧工作者是祖先的“不肖子孙”，破口大骂京剧革命是“蛮干”，鼓动地主资产阶级不要听“衙门”的“禁令”，公然叫嚣“你批你的，我演我的”，为戏剧界的牛鬼蛇神撑腰打气。这个反动透顶的家伙大肆诬蔑党对文艺工作的领导“政治上是瞎子，艺术上是盖子”，狂妄地声称要搞一个反对“命令主义”的命令主义，来一个“下命令不准禁演”。
    京剧革命是我国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大开端。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派从整个京剧舞台的大革命中，感到一场革命的暴风雨即将来临。因此，他们咬牙切齿地反对发动和领导这场京剧革命运动的无产阶级司令部，拚命压制和打击高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向旧京剧的顽固堡垒英勇冲击的革命旗手和先锋战士，以挽救自己濒临灭亡的命运，阻挡无产阶级文化大革命的历史洪流。
    二
  　为了反对京剧革命，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派肆意歪曲“百花齐放”、“推陈出新”的方针，只准毒草生，不准香花开，为牛鬼蛇神大批出笼发放通行证。在这方面，他们耍尽了种种手段，散布了一系列的反动谬论：
    （1）为了破坏京剧革命，他们提出了“两条腿走路”（有时提“三条腿”走路）这个极其虚假的口号。中国的赫鲁晓夫竭力主张旧剧和新剧、传统剧目和现代题材剧目要同时“并存”。他在文艺界的代理人也跟着叫嚷这“两条腿走路”要同时“并举”，“不可偏废”，“不要提以什么为主”。总之，他们要让旧剧和新剧平分秋色、分庭抗礼、和平共处、互不侵犯！问题明摆着：一个是宣扬封建主义、资本主义思想，为资本主义摇旗呐喊、鸣锣开道；一个是宣扬社会主义、共产主义思想，为社会主义擂鼓助威，大喊大叫。这“两条腿”怎么能同时并举、彼此合作呢？这里面的问题难道是一个简单的“两条腿”的问题吗？不是，一千个不是，一万个不是。这个所谓“两条腿”表现着两条路线、两条道路、两个阶级的尖锐斗争：一条腿要向前大跃进，迈到共产主义；一条腿则要朝后大倒退，退到半殖民地半封建社会。这里没有什么可以调和的余地。他们所说的“两条腿走路”，无非是想保护、发展旧京剧，排挤、反对现代革命京剧，妄图通过“并存”，扩大资本主义的地盘，缩小社会主义的阵地，最终把社会主义的文艺舞台和文艺队伍统统“吃掉”、“融化掉”。他们表面上装笑脸，假惺惺地说要“两条腿走路”，背地里却在动刀子，想把革命现代戏一刀砍掉，手段何其毒也！他们大开绿灯、废除“禁演令”，发放通行证，让帝王将相、才子佳人、牛鬼蛇神继续统治文艺舞台，正如文艺黑线的头目所招认的，他是要让这些毒草“保留到社会主义共产主义时代”，要“把它肯定下来，子子孙孙长期演下去”。看，他们的反革命气焰何等嚣张！
    （2）正当京剧革命大踏步向前迈进，以雷霆万钧之势向旧京剧这个反革命复辟的据点胜利进军的时候，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派又急忙跳出来拦路。他以反“左”的面目出现，装出一副“关心”京剧革命的样子，说什么“不要搞急了”，“不要硬生孩子”，“要瓜熟蒂落，水到渠成”……如此等等，不一而足。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派耍弄这种阴谋手段，无非是想原封不动地维持他们反革命修正主义的统治。所谓“不要搞急了”呀，“不要硬生孩子”呀，“要瓜熟蒂落，水到渠成”呀，统统是他们用来反对京剧革命的挡箭牌。试问，帝王将相、才子佳人长期霸占着社会主义的京剧舞台，历史是那样的被颠倒着，你们为什么不“急”？对刚刚冒芽露头的现代革命京剧《智取威虎山》等艺术新苗，你们又为什么那样咬牙切齿，迫不及待地想把它们扼杀在摇篮里？可见，你们反对“硬生孩子”是假，反对“生孩子”是真。什么“瓜熟蒂落”？瓜不熟便由你们砍掉了，还谈什么“蒂落”？你们的确修了“渠”，但不是为了疏通流水，而是筑了一条阻挡京剧革命洪流的堤防。
    （3）党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派由于迫于形势，迫于自上而来的无产阶级司令部的“压力”和从下而来的广大工农兵群众对京剧革命的强烈要求，他们又耍出了新花招，采取了以退为进的反革命策略。面临着京剧革命的巨大洪流，反革命修正主义分子彭真首先敏感到硬顶是顶不住了，于是便改变了腔调，假惺惺地说：“你们最近可以把那些古人戏稍微搁一搁，集中精力突破现代戏这一关比较好。”来个不争一时之短长，以求长远之生计。注意，这里他只是说“稍微搁一搁”，“稍微”后面隐藏着杀机，他们是要卷土重来的。事实上，他们大搞“古人戏”，大反现代戏的罪恶活动并没有“稍微搁一搁”，而是变本加厉地在进行。这些两面三刀、巧言令色的家伙之所以唱出“稍微搁一搁”的调头，无非是想在京剧革命的红色风暴面前，找块盾牌，打打掩护，避避风头，来个缓兵之计，一旦时机成熟，再反扑过来，进行反攻倒算，让帝王将相、才子佳人、牛鬼蛇神重新登台表演，专我们的政。我们必须剥下他们“赞助”京剧革命的“糖衣”，亮出他们反对京剧革命、反对无产阶级专政的“炮弹”。
    （4）他们还突出强调京剧的所谓特点，作为反对京剧革命的理由。他们挖空心思地定调子、划圈子、安框子，制造种种清规戒律，用来阻挠京剧革命。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派说：“京剧艺术水平高，不能轻视、不能乱改”，又说“改戏不要大改，有害稍改，无害不改。”这也摸不得，那也碰不得，就是不准无产阶级革命派革命，妄图捆住无产阶级革命派的手脚，用他们的框子把无产阶级革命派框死，用心又何其毒也。他们还别有用心地强调“京剧姓京”，强调京剧形式方面的特点，与京剧革命相对抗，说什么“京剧适合于表现帝王将相”，反映现代生活则成了“四不象”。他们恶毒地嘲笑现代革命京剧“象白开水”“是话剧加唱”。江青同志带着积极扶植新生事物的革命激情，有力地痛斥了一小撮反革命修正主义分子恶毒中伤现代革命京剧的种种反动谬论。她说得何其好啊：“这些人简直是无知！白开水有什么不好？有了白开水，才能泡茶，才能酿酒。没有白开水，活都活不了。‘话剧加唱’又有什么不好，从来的京剧都是话剧加唱，不说，不唱，哪儿来的戏？”此外，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派还胡说什么京剧革命后“有人不喜欢了”。我们要问：你们说的究竟是那些人？是工农兵吗？不对，工农兵最喜欢现代革命京剧。你们说的是旧社会的遗老遗少、地、富、反、坏、右等社会渣滓，你们爱他们之所爱，恨他们之所恨，充分暴露了你们的反动立场。
    综上所述，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派为了破坏京剧革命，阻挡无产阶级文化大革命的洪流飞奔向前，制造了种种“理论”，编造了种种“理由”，施展了种种阴谋诡计，玩弄了种种反革命两面派的毒辣手段。正如毛主席指出的：“各种剥削阶级的代表人物，当着他们处在不利情况的时候，为了保护他们现在的生存，以利将来的发展，他们往往采取以攻为守的策略。……总之，他们老是在研究对付我们的策略，‘窥视方向’，以求一逞。有时他们会‘装死躺下’，等待时机，‘反攻过去’。他们有长期的阶级斗争经验，他们会做各种形式的斗争——合法的斗争和非法的斗争。我们革命党人必须懂得他们这一套，必须研究他们的策略，以便战胜他们。切不可书生气十足，把复杂的阶级斗争看得太简单了。”
    三
  　革命的潮流是阻挡不了的。京剧界的无产阶级革命派在京剧革命的英勇旗手江青同志的带领下，披荆斩棘，终于冲破了阻拦京剧革命的堤防，捣碎了反革命修正主义的牢笼，把无产阶级胜利的旗帜插上了京剧这个最顽固的反革命碉堡。
    江青同志亲手栽培的现代革命京剧《智取威虎山》等八个革命样板戏是我们无产阶级的艺术明珠。《智取威虎山》等革命样板戏的出现，不仅从创作实践上有力地批驳了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派破坏京剧革命的种种反动谬论，同时使现代革命京剧在京剧舞台上站稳了脚跟。特别应当强调地指出，京剧革命为广大工农兵群众夺了京剧舞台的权，为无产阶级革命派全面夺取文艺舞台的权树立了光辉的榜样，创造了成功的经验，对文化思想部门的夺权斗争具有普遍的指导意义。这是敌人最害怕的。因此，他们拚命地加以反对，竭力贬低它的意义，缩小它的影响。他们的第一招是象鸵鸟一样，采取不承认主义。“三家村”反党集团的后台老板彭真狂吠什么“我是五人小组的”，“我不知道什么是革命样板戏”。但是，否认又否认不了，因此他们又鼓动并支持京剧界的保守势力和反动势力，搭帮成伙，打起排演样板戏的旗号来破坏革命的样板戏。正当江青同志遵照毛主席的要突出武装斗争的作用的指示，带领革命的京剧工作者进一步修改京剧样板戏《沙家浜》的时候，北京旧市委的反革命修正主义集团，指使某京剧团另搞一套，企图用他们修正主义的黑货来改造《沙家浜》，明目张胆地对抗毛主席的重要指示，与江青同志唱反调。他们这样做是想树起一面黑旗，以抵消革命样板戏的巨大影响，进行扰乱和破坏。
    他们破坏革命样板戏的另一招是采取攻心战，用渗透的办法，竭力把革命样板戏引向歧途。当排练革命现代京剧《海港》的时候，中国最大的走资本主义道路当权派亲自出马，大放厥词，把富有革命斗争传统的上海码头工人污蔑为自私卑微的“小人物”，浑浑噩噩的“愚民”和“群氓”。在他的反动观点的“指导”下，整个戏不去歌颂英雄人物，而在“中间人物”身上大作文章，让一个落后青年在社会主义舞台上发牢骚，说怪话，抒发社会主义制度下“有志者事竟不成”的感叹，发泄对新社会的动摇和不满。中国最大的走资本主义道路当权派妄图把京剧《海港》变成他用来培养资产阶级的接班人，复辟资本主义的舆论工具。
    一小撮反革命修正主义分子反对革命京剧样板戏的再一个招法是处心积虑地歪曲和丑化英雄人物的形象。他们在处理《红灯记》“刑场斗争”一场戏时，故意让鸠山把铁梅的爹爹和奶奶拉下去受刑，用音响制造一种阴森可怖的气氛，让铁梅陷入“保护爹爹奶奶”还是“保护密电码”的精神严重分裂的状态。这种艺术处理实际上是“英雄人物处于危急情况下必有三分钟动摇”的反动谬论的艺术表现，极大地歪曲了英雄人物的崇高的精神面貌。在排练革命样板戏《智取威虎山》时，他们竭力鼓吹突出杨子荣的“泼辣骠悍粗犷”，即所谓“江湖气”，“匪气”，要把杨子荣写的“比土匪还象土匪”。总之，他们极尽丑化歪曲污蔑之能事，千方百计地往英雄人物脸上抹黑。此外，他们在描绘对敌斗争的场面时，故意大肆渲染反面人物的嚣张气焰，大长反动派的志气，大灭革命派的威风；他们在描写人民战争以及在敌强我弱情况下刻划英雄人物时，故意不去表现人民战争的正义性和光明前途，反对突出表现英雄人物的革命的坚定性和坚韧性，反对突出表现他们的敢于藐视一切、战胜一切的革命的英雄主义和革命的乐观主义，却偏偏着意去渲染战争的恐怖和苦难，散布和平主义和投降主义，宣扬叛徒哲学；他们在描写地下斗争的题材时，往往把现代革命京剧引向“情节戏，惊险戏”的邪路。他们曾一度篡改了《沙家浜》、《红灯记》、《智取威虎山》的主题，极力掩盖、削弱作品的思想性和革命意义，千方百计地把它们引向歧路。
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派这样丧心病狂，穷凶极恶地反对京剧革命，究竟是为什么呢？
    中国最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其在文艺界的代理人，凭着他们反革命的经验，懂得在无产阶级专政的条件下要赤裸裸地反对无产阶级专政是很困难的，因而他们往往采用迂回曲折的手法，求助于过去的亡灵，利用古人的服装和语言，从事反党反社会主义的罪恶活动。他们之所以让死人登台表演、开口讲话，无非是要想把死人当作自己政治理想的号筒，为复辟资本主义狂热地呼喊；他们之所以要在死人身上灌注自己的生命，无非是要想借封建主义之尸，还资本主义之魂。僵尸仅是一个空壳而已，而灵魂则是他们自己。
    然而，既然要反革命，又要作得十分隐蔽是很难的。文艺界的一小撮反革命修正主义分子经常地、大量地用党内头号野心家所推荐的《游龙戏凤》那样的坏戏来毒害群众，麻痹人民的革命意识；当他们认为形势有利的时候，就撕下伪装，赤膊上阵，抛出闪着刀光剑影、毒性最大的“鬼戏”、“汉奸戏”、“冤狱戏”、
  “罢官戏”、“翻案戏”、“骂皇帝戏”，肆无忌惮地攻击社会主义制度和无产阶级专政，把矛头直接指向无产阶级司令部。什么《海瑞罢官》、《谢瑶环》、《李慧娘》、《于谦》、《四郎探母》、《恶虎村》、《活捉王魁》、《乾隆下江南》等等，都是反党反社会主义的大毒草。一个海瑞释职罢官，一个李慧娘破口大骂，一个谢瑶环鸣冤叫屈，一个于谦手提宝剑杀气腾腾……都是一支支刺向无产阶级专政，刺向无产阶级司令部的毒剑。文艺黑线的头目周扬在谈海瑞戏的时候曾不加掩饰地说：“海瑞是坚持原则、敢于斗争的人”，他敢于“骂皇帝”，“反对皇帝做坏事”，“骂皇帝精神可嘉”，并露骨地煽动说：“现在有些人胆子小，批评只限于科长一级干部，再上去便不敢了。”真是面目狰狞，反骨毕露。他们究竟想干什么，还不是十分清楚吗？
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派胡说什么“唱旧戏亡不了国”。这完全是骗人的鬼话。他们主张唱旧戏正是要唱掉社会主义这个国，唱出资本主义这个国。我们千万不可丧失警惕，掉以轻心。历史的车轮是阻挡不了的，社会主义一定要代替资本主义，共产主义的旗帜一定要插遍全世界。千钧霹雳开新宇，万里东风扫残云，让那些阻挡京剧革命的拦路虎跟着死人一块去见鬼吧！
