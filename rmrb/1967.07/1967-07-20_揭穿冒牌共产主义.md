The great leader Chairman Mao says: Communism is the "most complete, most progressive, most revolutionary, and most rational" social system since the beginning of human history. All true Marxists-Leninists, all true Communist Party members, regard communism as the ultimate goal of their lifelong struggle. Marxists-Leninists have always believed that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the inevitable path to communism. Whether or not to have the dictatorship of the proletariat is the fundamental criterion for distinguishing true communists from false ones. The biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party, in their work "Cultivation," betrayed the dictatorship of the proletariat and thus fundamentally betrayed communism.

The biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party do not mention the dictatorship of the proletariat in "Cultivation," but instead describe communism in glowing terms, asking, "Who could say such a society is not good?" This means that people of any class will praise communism, including China's Huang Shuren, Chiang Kai-shek, the bosses of Wall Street in the United States, and the likes of Johnson! If this is the case, then is the dictatorship of the proletariat not redundant during the entire historical period of transition from socialism to communism? One sentence reveals the secret. Their "communism" that is achieved without the dictatorship of the proletariat is actually a restoration of capitalism, completely in line with Khrushchev's advocacy in the Soviet Union of entering "communism" through the "whole people's state."

When the author of "Cultivation" talks about fake communism, he also says a couple of phrases like "no landlords, no capitalists," "no imperialism," and other high-sounding words. How did the landlords and capitalists disappear? It is said that they all "smiled broadly" and "entered" socialism and communism. This is sheer nonsense! Communism aims to eliminate exploitation and all class differences. Would the bosses be "smiling broadly"? They would certainly not be "smiling broadly," but would resist ten times more fiercely. Lenin said: "The development towards communism must go through the dictatorship of the proletariat and cannot take any other path, because there is no one else and no other path that can crush the resistance of the exploiting capitalists." However, "Cultivation" fabricates that after the revolution's victory, as long as "social and economic transformation and ideological and cultural transformation" are carried out, it is possible to "gradually transition to communism." Here, the dictatorship of the proletariat is missing, and the life-and-death struggle between the two lines of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie is also missing. Chairman Mao often reminds us: "The victory or defeat of the revolution will be decided over a very long historical period. If things are not done well, the restoration of capitalism is possible at any time." Therefore, the people who have won must consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent the restoration of capitalism, which is indeed the most important task. China's Khrushchev, however, wants people to forget this most important task and talk about the "transformation" of economy and culture. If we "transform" in this way, not only will we never reach communism, but even the revolutionary achievements we have already won will be lost completely.

The dictatorship of the proletariat is the inevitable path to communism. All true communists must never forget the dictatorship of the proletariat and strive to consolidate and strengthen it.

    揭穿冒牌共产主义
    班长  周本涛
    伟大领袖毛主席说：共产主义“是自有人类历史以来，最完全最进步最革命最合理的”社会制度。一切真正的马克思列宁主义者，一切真正的共产党员，都把共产主义作为终身奋斗的远大目标。马克思列宁主义者从来认为，无产阶级专政是通向共产主义的必由之路。要不要无产阶级专政，是真假共产主义者的根本标志。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所炮制的《修养》背叛了无产阶级专政，也就从根本上背叛了共产主义。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在《修养》里闭口不提无产阶级专政，却把共产主义说得天花乱坠，并且问道：“谁个能够说这样的社会不好呢？”这就是说，不管哪个阶级的人都会为共产主义叫好，连中国的黄世仁、蒋介石，美国的华尔街老板、约翰逊之流也都会喜欢共产主义的！既然是这样，那么在社会主义向共产主义过渡的整个历史时期，无产阶级专政岂不是多余的了吗？一句话泄漏了天机。他这种不经过无产阶级专政而实现的“共产主义”，实际上就是复辟资本主义，同苏联赫鲁晓夫鼓吹的通过“全民国家”进入“共产主义”完全是一路货。
    《修养》的作者在侈谈冒牌的共产主义时，也说了一两句“没有地主、资本家”，“没有帝国主义”等冠冕堂皇的话。地主、资本家是怎么没有的呢？据说是由于他们都“眉开眼笑”地“走入”了社会主义和共产主义。这简直是欺人之谈！共产主义要消灭剥削，消灭一切阶级差别，那些财东们能“眉开眼笑”吗？他们决不是什么“眉开眼笑”，而是凶猛十倍的反抗。列宁说：“向共产主义发展，必须经过无产阶级专政，决不能走别的道路，因为再没有其他人也没有其他道路能够粉碎剥削者资本家的反抗。”可是，《修养》却胡诌什么，革命胜利以后，只要“进行社会经济的改造和思想文化的改造”，就“能逐步过渡到共产主义去”。这里无产阶级专政又不见了，无产阶级和资产阶级之间你死我活的两条道路的斗争也不见了。毛主席经常告诫我们：“革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。”因而，胜利了的人民，怎样巩固和加强无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，实在是压倒一切的头等大事。中国的赫鲁晓夫却要人们忘掉这件头等大事，去侈谈什么经济和文化的“改造”。照这样去“改造”，不要说根本到不了共产主义，就连已经取得的革命成果也会丧失干净。
    无产阶级专政是通向共产主义的必由之路。一切真正的共产主义者，一定要念念不忘无产阶级专政，努力巩固和加强无产阶级专政。
