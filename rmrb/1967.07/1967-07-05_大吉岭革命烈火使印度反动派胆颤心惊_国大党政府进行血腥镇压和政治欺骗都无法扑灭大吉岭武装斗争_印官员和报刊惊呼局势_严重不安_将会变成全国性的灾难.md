The revolutionary fire in Darjeeling has made Indian reactionaries tremble with fear. The Congress Party government's attempts at bloody suppression and political deception have failed to extinguish the armed struggle in Darjeeling. Indian officials and newspapers are alarmed, describing the situation as "serious unrest" and warning that it could become a national disaster.

According to a report from New Delhi on July 4, after the people of Darjeeling District in West Bengal established an area of armed struggle, the panicked Indian reactionaries hastily resorted to armed suppression and political deception in an attempt to extinguish the revolutionary armed struggle in the area.

The central government of India is currently mainly using the West Bengal government to suppress the revolutionary fire in Darjeeling District. This reactionary ruling tool, which is praised by the traitorous Deng Xiaoping clique as a "non-Congress people's government," faithfully executes the central government's counter-revolutionary directives and has carried out a series of tense activities.

In mid-May, when the armed struggle in Darjeeling District rapidly developed, the state government sent the Minister of Land and Taxation to Naxalbari to attempt a so-called "political solution," trying to deceive the local people into abandoning the armed struggle. However, the leaders of the struggle, the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, refused to meet with him.

When the soft approach failed, they resorted to the hard approach. The state government sent a large number of armed police to the Naxalbari area, and on May 24 and 25, they clashed with the people's armed forces. The police shot and killed nine insurgent farmers and arrested over a hundred people. The reactionary police's bloody suppression further enraged the armed people, who more bravely carried out the struggle to seize land, grain, and weapons from the landlords.

After the state government's suppression failed, the Chief Minister of West Bengal, Mukherjee (a member of the Bengal Congress Party that split from the Congress Party), personally took charge. On May 27, he rushed to Siliguri and convened an emergency meeting with officials from various districts in northern West Bengal to plot the suppression of the armed struggle in Naxalbari and other places.

In mid-June, Mukherjee, on one hand, dispatched two companies of police from Calcutta to Siliguri to prepare for the suppression of the people's armed struggle and sent troops and police to seal off the borders of Darjeeling District with Pakistan and Nepal; on the other hand, he sent six state government ministers to Naxalbari on June 12 to engage in political intrigue. These officials deceived the local people, saying that the government would "promptly address" their grievances, while also issuing an ultimatum, threatening to use force against the so-called "rebellion" after June 20. Later, the state government extended the deadline for the so-called "rebels" to surrender to July 4.

The revolutionary people of Darjeeling District responded to the reactionaries' tactics of both carrot and stick, pressure and deception with proactive attacks on reactionary police stations and landlord estates. The *Indian Express* on June 20 had to admit: "For the past three days, these six ministers have been working hard to bring the leaders they call 'misguided' to the negotiating table, but their sincere efforts have had no effect on the increasingly out-of-control situation in these three areas."

A small spark can start a prairie fire. The armed struggle of the farmers in Darjeeling District has inspired the peasant struggles in other areas. The *Statesman* of India admitted: "Unrest is brewing among the peasants in various parts of West Bengal, and the situation could easily get out of control."

According to a report from New Delhi on July 4, the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India led the peasants in the rural areas of Darjeeling District in West Bengal to launch an armed struggle, making the running dogs of American imperialism, the Indian reactionaries, tremble with fear.

According to reports, after Congress Party Chairman Kamaraj returned from Madras to New Delhi, the central content of his first meeting with Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi on June 8 was the situation in West Bengal.

The news that three villages, including Naxalbari, had established revolutionary governments, caused a commotion in the Indian Parliament on June 13. After the Minister of Home Affairs, Chavan, reported to the Parliament that the farmers in Naxalbari had carried out eighty "lawless" actions, he said that the recent developments in this strategically important area had made the Indian government "seriously concerned," especially the "theft" of weapons and ammunition.

The *Indian Express* exclaimed that the armed struggle of the farmers in the Naxalbari area of Darjeeling District was not only a "headache" but also "would become a national disaster."

　　大吉岭革命烈火使印度反动派胆颤心惊
　　国大党政府进行血腥镇压和政治欺骗都无法扑灭大吉岭武装斗争
　　印官员和报刊惊呼局势“严重不安”“将会变成全国性的灾难”
    据新华社四日讯　新德里消息：印度西孟加拉邦大吉岭县人民建立了武装斗争地区以后，惊慌失措的印度反动派急急忙忙使出武装镇压和政治欺骗的反革命两手，企图扑灭这个地区的革命武装斗争。
    印度中央政府目前主要通过西孟加拉邦政府去扑灭大吉岭县的革命之火。这个被叛徒丹吉集团吹捧为“非国大党的人民政府”的反动统治工具，忠实地执行中央政府的反革命指令，进行了一系列紧张的活动。
    五月中，当大吉岭县地区的武装斗争迅速发展的时候，邦政府派土地和税收部长到纳萨尔巴里去，企图通过所谓“政治解决”，诱骗当地人民放弃武装斗争。但是领导斗争的印共革命派拒绝会见他。
    软的一手失败，就来硬的一手。邦政府派了大批武装警察，进驻纳萨尔巴里地区，在五月二十四日和二十五日等几天内，同人民武装发生了冲突。警察开枪打死九名起义农民，逮捕一百多人。反动警察的血腥镇压更加激怒了武装的人民，他们更加勇猛地开展向地主夺地、夺粮、夺枪的斗争。
    西孟加拉邦统治集团的这次镇压失败以后，由邦的首席部长慕克吉（从国大党分裂出来的孟加拉大会党人）亲自出马。他在五月二十七日赶到西里古里，召集西孟加拉邦北部各县的官员举行紧急会议，密谋镇压纳萨尔巴里等地的武装斗争。
    六月中旬，慕克吉一方面从加尔各答增调两连警察到西里古里，准备镇压人民武装斗争，并且派军队和警察封锁了大吉岭地区同巴基斯坦和尼泊尔接壤的边界；一方面又在十二日派了六名邦政府部长到纳萨尔巴里去搞政治阴谋。这些官员欺骗当地人民说，政府当局将“迅速注意”他们的不满意见，同时又向人民发出“最后通牒”，威胁说，要在六月二十日以后采取武力对付所谓的“叛乱”。后来，邦政府又把所谓“叛乱分子自首”的限期，推迟到七月四日。
    大吉岭县的革命人民，用主动出击反动警察局和地主庄园等革命行动，来回答反动派的又打又拉、又压又骗的反革命两面手法。《印度斯坦旗报》六月二十日也不得不承认：“三天来，这六位部长十分卖力地想把他们称之为‘误入歧途’的领导人带到会议桌旁来，但是他们虔诚的努力对这三个地区的日益加剧的无法无天的发展情况不起作用。”
    星星之火，可以燎原。大吉岭县农民坚持革命武装斗争，鼓舞了其它地区的农民斗争。印度《政治家报》承认：“西孟加拉邦各地正在出现农民的骚动，局势很容易会控制不住。”
    据新华社四日讯　新德里消息：印度共产党革命派领导农民在西孟加拉邦大吉岭县农村中开展武装斗争，使美帝的走狗印度反动派吓得胆颤心惊。
    据报道，国大党主席卡马拉季从马德拉斯邦赶回新德里后，六月八日和印度总理英迪拉·甘地举行的第一次会议，中心内容就是西孟加拉邦的局势问题。
    纳萨尔巴里等三个乡建立了革命政府的消息，六月十三日在印度议会中引起了议员们的一片吵闹声。内政部长恰范在向议会报告了纳萨尔巴里农民进行了八十起“无法无天”的行动后说，这个具有战略意义的地区最近局势的发展使印度政府“严重不安”，特别严重的是发生了“偷窃”武器和军火的事件。
    《印度斯坦旗报》惊呼，大吉岭县纳萨尔巴里地区的农民武装斗争，不仅是一件“头疼的事”，而且“将会变成全国性的灾难”。
