Proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary masses, and PLA soldiers and officers from all over the country have been holding large-scale rallies and demonstrations in recent days to celebrate the victorious and glorious return of Comrades Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li from Wuhan to Chairman Mao's side. Revolutionary masses and PLA soldiers and officers from various places have expressed their revolutionary enthusiasm, enthusiastically celebrating the new great victory of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, angrily denouncing the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan, and resolutely supporting the revolutionary struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan.

From the coast of the East China Sea to the foot of the Tian Shan Mountains, from the banks of the Heilongjiang River to the Yunnan-Guizhou Plateau, across the vast land of our great motherland, large-scale demonstrations have been held everywhere in the past few days, and thunderous roars have echoed: Down with the Chinese Khrushchev! Down with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the army! Down with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the army in Wuhan! Down with the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes Army" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line! The large-scale rallies and demonstrations in various places have concentratedly expressed the iron will of hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses across the country: Defend the Party Central Committee to the death, defend Chairman Mao to the death, defend Vice Chairman Lin to the death, defend the Central Cultural Revolution Group to the death, and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death!

In recent days, places such as Beijing, Shanghai, Wuhan, Tianjin, Chengdu, Harbin, Jinan, Qingdao, Taiyuan, Guiyang, Xining, Kunming, Changsha, Urumqi, and Xi'an have all held rallies and demonstrations with tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, and even millions of people, expressing that the proletarian revolutionaries across the country will be a strong backing for the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan. Participants in the demonstrations held up giant portraits of Chairman Mao, waved red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao, ten thousand years, ten thousand ten thousand years!" and "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" The broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and PLA soldiers and officers participating in the rallies and demonstrations pointed out that in the great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, no matter what storms and waves arise, Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line will continue to lead the revolutionary people of the whole country from victory to victory. They firmly declared that they will definitely raise the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought higher, concentrate their firepower, focus their targets, and launch a more fierce general attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, exposing them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and resolutely carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

Today, 500,000 military and civilian personnel from the PLA and the revolutionary masses in Tianjin held a grand rally and demonstration in the rain. Revolutionary comrades from Wuhan also participated in the rally and demonstration. Tens of thousands of revolutionary masses were spirited and full of fighting spirit. When the meeting began in the rain, all the soldiers and officers of the three services and the revolutionary masses in the entire venue sang "The East Is Red." The military representative Liu Zheng, on behalf of the Tianjin Municipal Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group and the PLA soldiers and officers stationed in Tianjin, spoke at the meeting, expressing their firm support for the instructions and decisions of the Party Central Committee and the Central Cultural Revolution Group on handling the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan, resolute support for the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan, and a pledge to unite, fight, and win together with them. Representatives from Tianjin and Wuhan revolutionary factions also spoke at the meeting.

Zhang Guohua, the first political commissar of the Chengdu Military Region and the head of the Chengdu Military Region Revolutionary Committee Preparatory Group, spoke at the meeting. He said that the Party Central Committee sent Comrades Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li to Wuhan to handle the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution there, which is the greatest concern and support from the great leader Chairman Mao for the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses in Wuhan, and also a great encouragement to the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses across the country. We, the proletarian revolutionaries and the PLA Chengdu Military Region in the Chengdu area, strongly condemn and denounce the heinous crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the army in Wuhan; with the greatest determination, we support the revolutionary actions of the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan and pledge to be their strong backing.

This shows that their counter-revolutionary arrogance has reached a crazy level, and at the same time, it shows that this is their last struggle before their doom.

They will definitely not have a good ending.

In their speeches at the rallies, the proletarian revolutionaries pointed out that from the practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year, we have deeply understood that Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group care about and support the proletarian revolutionaries the most and can best represent the revolutionary demands and wishes of the proletarian revolutionaries and the revolutionary masses.
