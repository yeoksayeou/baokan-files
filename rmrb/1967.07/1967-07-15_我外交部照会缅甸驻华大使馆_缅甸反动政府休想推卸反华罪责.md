The Chinese Foreign Ministry sent a note to the Burmese Embassy in China on July 14, strongly refuting the Burmese government's lies in its note and its attempt to shirk responsibility for obstructing the Chinese Embassy in Burma from investigating the persecution of Chinese nationals and refusing the Chinese government's request to send planes to Rangoon to evacuate seriously injured Chinese nationals for treatment.

The note from the Chinese Foreign Ministry said that in the savage anti-China and anti-Chinese incidents it instigated, the Burmese government carried out horrendous massacres, mass arrests, arson, and looting against the broad masses of Chinese nationals. In response, the Chinese government demanded that the Chinese Embassy in Burma send personnel to investigate the specific circumstances of the persecution of Chinese nationals in areas where they reside, and to send planes to Rangoon to evacuate seriously injured Chinese nationals for treatment. This is completely reasonable and just, and the Burmese government has no grounds to refuse.

The note said that in its July 4 reply to the Chinese Embassy on this issue, the Burmese government claimed that it was providing adequate medical treatment to the injured Chinese nationals. This is a blatant lie. The fact is that the seriously injured Chinese nationals, who were beaten by the mobs you incited, did not receive the necessary treatment in the hospital, and many seriously injured Chinese nationals died due to not receiving timely emergency treatment and medical care. Can this be called providing "medical convenience"? If the facts were truly as you fabricated them, why were you so afraid of the Chinese Embassy personnel going to visit and comfort them, and why did you obstruct and harass them in every possible way?

The note said that you have repeatedly refused the Chinese government's reasonable request to send planes to evacuate seriously injured Chinese nationals for treatment, and you have even used the excuse that "before the relevant issues regarding the current crisis are resolved, they cannot be allowed to leave Burma." This is precisely your confession that you are planning to carry out even greater persecution of Chinese nationals. Your so-called martial law in the areas where Chinese nationals reside can only show that you are ruthless and intend to use guns and bayonets to cover up the even more brutal persecution of Chinese nationals by Burmese mobs. You have deprived the Chinese Embassy of its diplomatic privileges, restricted the Embassy's contact with Chinese nationals, and infringed upon the Embassy's sacred and inviolable right to protect the legitimate rights and interests of Chinese nationals, because you are extremely afraid that the Chinese Embassy will spread the great thoughts of Chairman Mao and convey the concern and love of the Chinese government and people to the broad masses of Chinese nationals.

The note pointed out that you have committed heinous crimes against the broad masses of Chinese nationals, killing and injuring people, setting fires, and looting. Now, you are refusing to allow the Chinese Embassy to send personnel to investigate and refusing to allow the Chinese government to send planes to evacuate seriously injured Chinese nationals for treatment. This fully exposes your guilt and fear of exposure. You vainly hope to use such despicable means to cover up your crimes and escape the stern condemnation of the Chinese people, the Burmese people, and the world's just public opinion, but this is absolutely impossible.

The note reiterated: The Burmese government's unreasonable refusal of the Chinese government's aforementioned just demands must bear all the serious consequences that arise from this.

### 我外交部照会缅甸驻华大使馆  缅甸反动政府休想推卸反华罪责

    我外交部照会缅甸驻华大使馆
    缅甸反动政府休想推卸反华罪责
    新华社十四日讯　中华人民共和国外交部七月十四日照会缅甸驻华大使馆，严正驳斥缅甸政府在来照中编造谎言，企图推卸它阻止中国驻缅甸大使馆调查华侨受迫害的具体情况和拒绝中国政府派飞机到仰光接运重伤华侨回国治疗的罪责。
    中国外交部的照会说，缅甸政府在它一手制造的野蛮透顶的反华排华事件中，对广大华侨进行了骇人听闻的大屠杀、大逮捕、大焚烧、大抢劫。对此，中国政府要求由中国驻缅甸大使馆派人到华侨居住地区调查华侨遭受迫害的具体情况，并派飞机到仰光接运重伤华侨回国治疗，这完全是正当合理的，缅甸政府根本没有理由加以拒绝。
    照会说，缅甸政府在七月四日就此问题答复中国大使馆的来照中，硬说什么你们正在给予受伤华侨以充分的医疗方便。这真是骗人的谎言。事实是，被你们指使暴徒毒打的重伤华侨，他们在医院里根本没有得到应有的治疗，不少重伤华侨由于得不到及时的急救和医治而死亡。这能说“给予”了什么“医疗方便”吗？试问，如果事实真象你们精心编造的那样，你们为什么对中国大使馆人员前往慰问和探望那样怕得要死，百般阻止和刁难呢？
    照会说，你们一再拒绝中国政府派飞机接运重伤华侨回国治疗的正当要求，还借口什么“在有关目前危机的事项得到解决前，不能允许他们离开缅甸”。这正是你们将要进行更大规模的迫害华侨的自供。你们对华侨居住区实行所谓军事管制，只能说明你们穷凶极恶，企图用枪口和刺刀掩护缅甸暴徒对华侨进行更加残酷的迫害。你们剥夺中国大使馆的外交特权，限制大使馆同华侨接触，侵犯大使馆维护华侨正当权益的神圣不可侵犯的权利，是因为你们非常害怕中国大使馆向广大华侨传播伟大的毛泽东思想和传达中国政府、中国人民对广大侨胞的关怀和爱护。
    照会指出，你们对广大华侨，杀人行凶，纵火抢劫，对中国人民犯下了滔天大罪，而现在又拒绝中国大使馆派人去调查，拒绝中国政府派飞机接运重伤华侨回国治疗，这充分暴露了你们作贼心虚，怕见阳光。你们妄想用这种卑劣的手段来掩盖你们的罪行，以逃避中国人民、缅甸人民和世界公正舆论的严正谴责是绝对办不到的。
    照会重申：缅甸政府无理拒绝中国政府的上述严正要求，必须承担由此而产生的一切严重后果。
