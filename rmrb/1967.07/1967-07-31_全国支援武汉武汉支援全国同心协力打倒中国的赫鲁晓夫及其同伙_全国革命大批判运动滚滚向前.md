	Nation Supports Wuhan, Wuhan Supports Nation: United Efforts to Overthrow China's Khrushchev and His Clique
	The National Revolutionary Criticism Movement Rolls On

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 30th, the proletarian revolutionary factions nationwide and the People's Liberation Army are fully supporting the large-scale mass movement of the proletarian revolutionary factions in Wuhan, greatly inspiring the revolutionary people of Wuhan. The continuous victory news from Wuhan is also greatly encouraging the revolutionary people across the nation. The nation supports Wuhan, and Wuhan supports the nation; these two massive revolutionary tides are driving the nationwide revolutionary criticism movement against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road forward.

	The capital of our great motherland has expressed its support for the revolutionary comrades in Wuhan, fully representing the strong will of hundreds of millions of military and civilian personnel across the nation. In recent days, demonstrations and parades have been continuous in the capital. A more massive wave of criticism and struggle is surging across various fronts in the capital. The proletarian revolutionary factions in industry, transportation, agriculture, forestry, finance, commerce, culture, education, news, and publishing have either already united or are uniting to carry out revolutionary criticism. The broad proletarian revolutionary factions are determined to spare no effort to push the revolutionary criticism to a new stage, using their revolutionary actions to further support the proletarian revolutionary factions in the Wuhan area and to achieve new and even greater victories in the Cultural Revolution.

	The broad proletarian revolutionary factions, revolutionary masses, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai have taken a more vigorous posture and concentrated firepower to expose, criticize, and struggle against China's Khrushchev. The firm support for the activities of the proletarian revolutionary factions in Wuhan is powerfully driving the revolutionary criticism movement forward on various fronts in Shanghai.

	In Harbin, in recent days, more than a million military and civilian personnel have participated in rallies and street parades. Many factories, offices, schools, stores, and rural people's communes, along with the stationed troops, have also held denunciation meetings and criticism sessions on the spot. The broad proletarian revolutionary factions and stationed soldiers have pointed out: We must press on with one breath, pursue victory, and launch a more intense total attack and thorough settlement against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Revolutionary criticism is the current greatest political issue, greatest principle, greatest truth, and greatest historical task. We are determined to carry out the revolutionary criticism to the end.

	"Thoroughly overthrow China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Southwest and Sichuan Province!" In recent days, more than a million people have participated in grand rallies and parades in Chengdu, where such roars can be heard everywhere. A massive revolutionary criticism movement is vigorously unfolding in the Chengdu area. The broad proletarian revolutionary factions and stationed soldiers have firmly stated that we must unite under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, stand united, and direct our struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, launching a fierce attack on them, and achieving new merits and new labor in this unprecedented criticism!

	The People's Liberation Army stationed in Hohhot, along with the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses of various ethnic groups in Hohhot, have had their pulses beating in unison with those of the proletarian revolutionary factions in Wuhan these days. They have held large-scale rallies and parades. The Red Guards Third Command of Hohhot and many other revolutionary mass organizations, with deep hatred for China's Khrushchev and his agents, have held denunciation meetings and criticism sessions. This wave of denunciation, criticism, and struggle is continuing to develop in depth.

	The broad revolutionary factions in Jinan and Qingdao have further recognized the heinous crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party and the military in the Wuhan area, further igniting their deep hatred for China's Khrushchev and his clique. The Jinan Red Guards and broad revolutionary youth, who are charging ahead in the revolutionary criticism, recently held a criticism meeting with over 50,000 participants, striking back at China's Khrushchev's new counterattack. After holding a parade with over 300,000 participants, the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses in Qingdao have been holding criticism meetings in various industries in recent days, settling accounts with the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison spread by China's Khrushchev in various fields. The leadership of the Jinan troops and the broad soldiers stationed in Shandong have stated: We must firmly stand with the proletarian revolutionary factions, further improve the "three supports, two militaries" work, and carry the Cultural Revolution to the end.

	In recent days, tens of thousands of proletarian revolutionary factions, revolutionary masses, and stationed soldiers in Guiyang have held grand rallies and parades. The broad revolutionary masses have stated: We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, ride the current favorable revolutionary situation, and launch a broader and deeper wave of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticizing and exposing China's Khrushchev and his agents in various places, seizing their power organizationally, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and drowning them in the vast ocean of the people's war, ensuring they never rise again.

	In recent days, the vast rural areas of our country have also launched revolutionary activities in firm support of the proletarian revolutionary factions in Wuhan.
