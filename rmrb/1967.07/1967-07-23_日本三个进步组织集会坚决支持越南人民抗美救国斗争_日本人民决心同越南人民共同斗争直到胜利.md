Three progressive organizations in Japan hold a meeting to resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation
Japanese people are determined to fight alongside the Vietnamese people until victory

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 22nd, the East Asia News Agency reported: On the 20th, more than 50 activists from the Asia-Africa People's Solidarity Committee of Japan, the Japan Federation of Newspaper Workers, and the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) headquarters held a meeting in Tokyo to resolutely support the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression for national salvation and the armed struggle of the peoples of Asia and Africa.

The meeting passed a resolution fully supporting the five-point statement of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the four demands of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The resolution stated: The Vietnamese people, closely united and fighting bravely, have frustrated the armed aggression of U.S. imperialism and its puppets, seized the initiative in the war, and achieved continuous victories.

The resolution exposed the treacherous behavior of modern revisionism in the Soviet Union. The resolution said that the Soviet revisionists betrayed the Arab nation in the Middle East and surrendered to U.S. imperialism. The Soviet revisionists and their followers are also playing tricks in the Vietnam issue, attempting to force the Vietnamese people to engage in "peace talks" with the U.S. under pressure.

The resolution enthusiastically supported the armed struggle for justice being waged by the peoples of Laos, Burma, India, the Philippines, Indonesia, and the Arab countries.

The resolution enthusiastically supported the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

The resolution emphasized: The Japanese people resolutely stand on the side of the Vietnamese people and the peoples of various countries in Asia and Africa, and together strengthen the struggle against U.S. imperialism, the reactionary Sato government, and the revisionist elements of the Japanese Communist Party until the national liberation struggles in Asia, Africa, and Latin America achieve complete victory.

    决议热烈支持正在进行正义的武装斗争的老挝、缅甸、印度、菲律宾、印度尼西亚、阿拉伯各国人民。
    决议热烈支持中国的无产阶级文化大革命。
