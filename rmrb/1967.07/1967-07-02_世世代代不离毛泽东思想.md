		"The Cultivation of the Self" attacks our most beloved and most beloved Red Sun, Chairman Mao, and opposes our lifeblood, Mao Zedong Thought. The biggest capitalist-roaders within the party do not see the iron wall of seven hundred million Chinese people, daring to be so arrogant, truly like a beetle carrying a millstone, seeking their own destruction!

		Chairman Mao is the great leader of the Chinese people, the great teacher of the revolutionary people of the whole world. We poor and lower-middle peasants love and support Chairman Mao the most. Chairman Mao trusts and cares for us poor and lower-middle peasants the most. Chairman Mao's heart is connected with ours. Chairman Mao is our guide. Chairman Mao said: "Without poor peasants, there would be no revolution." Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we overthrew the three big mountains, stood up, and became masters. Chairman Mao said: "The masses harbor a great deal of socialist enthusiasm." Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we left the small peasant economy of a single plank bridge and took the socialist path. Chairman Mao said: "You should pay attention to state affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we launched a magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, ensuring that the proletarian iron mountain will not change color for thousands of years. Chairman Mao said: "Grasp revolution, promote production." Under the leadership of Chairman Mao, we are both revolutionary vanguards and production pioneers, achieving double victories in revolution and production. Without the correct leadership of Chairman Mao, there would be no revolutionary victory. We poor and lower-middle peasants will never leave our great leader Chairman Mao.

		"The Cultivation of the Self" does not mention at all becoming a good student of Chairman Mao, does not mention Mao Zedong Thought at all. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism of our time. Without Mao Zedong Thought, it is fundamentally to deviate from Marxism-Leninism. We must read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, becoming good soldiers of Chairman Mao. Even an old peasant woman like me, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, has read Chairman Mao's books, and my eyes have brightened; I can see clearly who is good and who is bad; my ears have become keen; I can hear clearly what is good and what is bad; my mind has become smart; I can distinguish clearly between socialism and capitalism. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we used Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and exposed a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, digging out the backstage boss of the revisionists.

		No matter how busy, we must not forget to study Chairman Mao's works; no matter how many things, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought is the first thing. We poor and lower-middle peasants will not leave Mao Zedong Thought in our lifetime, and generation after generation will not leave Mao Zedong Thought.

　　世世代代不离毛泽东思想
　　学习毛主席著作积极分子  洪泾大队贫农社员  顾阿桃
    《修养》攻击我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，反对我们的命根子毛泽东思想。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派不看看中国七亿人民结成的铜墙铁壁，胆敢这样猖狂，真是坑虫扛石磨子，自己找死！
    毛主席是中国人民的伟大领袖，是全世界革命人民的伟大导师。我们贫下中农最热爱、最拥护伟大领袖毛主席，毛主席最相信、最关心我们贫下中农。毛主席和我们贫下中农心连着心。毛主席是我们贫下中农的带路人。毛主席说：“没有贫农，便没有革命。”我们在毛主席的领导下，推翻了三座大山，翻了身，做了主人。毛主席说：“群众中蕴藏了一种极大的社会主义的积极性”。我们在毛主席领导下，离开小农经济独木桥，走上社会主义阳关道。毛主席说：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”我们在毛主席领导下，轰轰烈烈地开展了无产阶级文化大革命，保证无产阶级铁打江山千秋万代不变色。毛主席说：“抓革命，促生产”。我们在毛主席领导下，既当革命先锋，又当生产闯将，夺取革命生产双胜利。没有毛主席的正确领导，就没有革命的胜利。我们贫下中农永远不离开伟大的领袖毛主席。
    《修养》根本不讲要做毛主席的好学生，根本不提毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，离开了毛泽东思想，就是从根本上背离了马克思列宁主义。我们一定要读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士。象我这样的贫农老太婆，在解放军的帮助下，读了毛主席的书，眼睛亮了，好人坏人看得清；耳朵灵了，好话坏话听得清；脑子变聪明了，社会主义、资本主义分得清。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们用毛泽东思想做武器，就揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，挖出了修正主义分子的总后台。
    千忙万忙，学习毛主席著作不能忘；千桩万桩，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗头一桩。我们贫下中农一辈子不离开毛泽东思想，世世代代都不离开毛泽东思想。
