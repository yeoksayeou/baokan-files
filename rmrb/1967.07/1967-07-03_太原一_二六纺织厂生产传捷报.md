Taiyuan No. 126 Textile Mill's revolutionary rebels have achieved victory in their struggle for power. They resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great line of "grasp revolution, promote production," achieving a tremendous victory in the first half of the year by over-fulfilling the state plan for cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and dyed fabric. By the end of June, the mill had completed 54.4% of its annual production plan for cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and dyed fabric. The total output value exceeded the first half-year plan by 15%. The output of all major products has increased significantly compared to the same period last year, and the quality of the products has also improved.
