	National rapeseed production has increased by one-tenth. According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 6th, as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution enters the high tide of revolutionary criticism and struggle, our country's major rapeseed-producing regions have continuously reported bumper harvests. Statistics show that this year's national rapeseed production is approximately one-tenth higher than last year. This is a new victory for the boundless thought of Mao Zedong, and another fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	Currently, rapeseed harvesting has been completed in various regions. The rapeseed production in major producing areas such as Hubei, Jiangxi, Sichuan, and Hunan has increased by one-tenth to two-tenths compared to last year, with some areas seeing even greater increases.

	At present, poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in rapeseed-producing areas are diligently studying Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as the "Three Constantly Read Articles," breaking down the "self" and establishing the "public," eagerly selling rapeseed to the state, and actively completing the state's grain and oil procurement tasks.

　　全国油菜籽总产量增长一成
    据新华社六日讯　在无产阶级文化大革命进入革命的大批判、大斗争的高潮中，我国广大油菜籽产区不断传来丰收喜讯。据统计，今年全国油菜籽的总产量约比去年增长一成。这是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的新胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的又一丰硕成果。
    现在，各地油菜籽已经收割完毕。湖北、江西、四川和湖南等重要产区的油菜籽产量，都比去年增产一成到两成以上，有的增得更多。
    目前，各油菜籽产区的贫下中农和革命干部，正认真学习毛主席的“老三篇”等光辉著作，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，踊跃向国家交售油菜籽，积极完成国家的粮油征购任务。
