The great unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat is an inevitable trend in the development of the Cultural Revolution. It is as inevitable as a thousand streams flowing into the sea, and it is not something that can be changed by human will. Those who do not recognize the inevitability of this great unity of the revolution but instead go against this trend will not gain freedom. Freedom is the recognition of necessity and the transformation of the objective world. Understanding the inevitability of the great unity of the revolution and acting according to the needs of this great unity, removing anything that does not conform to the great unity of the revolution, will enable one to achieve freedom and victory in the struggle.

    千条小河归大海
    无产阶级革命派的大联合，是文化大革命运动发展的必然趋势，就象千条小河归大海一样，是不以人的意志为转移的。谁要是不认识革命的大联合这种必然性，而是逆着这个潮流走，谁就得不到自由。自由是对必然的认识和对客观世界的改造。懂得了革命的大联合的必然性，并且按照革命的大联合的需要去行动，去掉不符合革命的大联合的东西，就能在斗争中取得自由，取得胜利。
