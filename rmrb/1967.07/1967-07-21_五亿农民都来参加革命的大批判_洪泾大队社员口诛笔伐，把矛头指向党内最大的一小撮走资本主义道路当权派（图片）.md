The famous unit for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works – the Hongjin Production Brigade of Shaoxi People's Commune in Taicang County, Jiangsu Province – has armed itself with Mao Zedong Thought in this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution. They have smashed the "self" and established the "public," bravely defended Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, and launched a fierce criticism against the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party.

At this critical moment of the proletarian cultural revolution, when the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines is intensifying, the revolutionary masses of Hongjin Production Brigade have firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and launched a fierce attack against the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. This is a field criticism meeting they held.

	Below right: The poor and lower-middle peasants of Hongjin Production Brigade remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "All revolutionary struggles are for the purpose of seizing power and consolidating it." They resolutely defend the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is the political squad leader of the Fourth Production Team, Li Shusong, exposing the hidden counter-revolutionary accounts (bottom left corner) of the class enemy during the cultural revolution, and striking a heavy blow to the class enemy's plot to restore the old order.

	Newspaper reporters: Lü Houmin and Wang Wenhua

	The revolutionary masses of Hongjin Production Brigade remember Chairman Mao's teaching to "carry the revolution through to the end." They speak out and write to direct the spearhead at the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, vowing to criticize and expose them thoroughly, so that they will never be able to stage a comeback! This is a criticism meeting held by the militia battalion of Hongjin Production Brigade.

	The militiamen of Hongjin Production Brigade remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "The enemy will not perish of itself. Whether it is the Chinese reactionaries or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not withdraw from the historical stage of their own accord." The militiamen keep their guns in hand and maintain a high degree of revolutionary vigilance at all times. This is them studying Chairman Mao's quotations.

    五亿农民都来参加革命的大批判
    ——洪泾大队社员口诛笔伐，把矛头指向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派
    著名的活学活用毛主席著作先进单位——江苏省太仓县沙溪公社洪泾大队革命群众，在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，勇敢捍卫毛主席的革命路线，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开了大批判。
    在无产阶级文化大革命进入两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的关键时刻，洪泾大队革命群众坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线一边，向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火。这是他们举行的一次田头批判会。
    下右：洪泾大队贫下中农牢记毛主席的教导：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”他们坚决捍卫无产阶级专政。这是在文化大革命中，第四生产队政治队长李树松把阶级敌人暗藏的变天账（左下角）拿出来示众，狠狠打击了阶级敌人的复辟阴谋。

    洪泾大队的革命群众，牢记毛主席“将革命进行到底”的教导，口诛笔伐，把矛头直指党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，誓把他们批倒批臭，叫他们永世不得翻身！这是洪泾大队民兵营召开的一次批判会。
    洪泾大队的民兵，牢记毛主席的教导：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”民兵们紧握手中枪，时刻保持高度的革命警惕性。这是他们在学习毛主席语录。
