Title: A Great Historical Task

On the vast land of our heroic motherland, covering 9.6 million square kilometers, hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, following the brilliant strategic deployment of Chairman Mao, the great helmsman, are engaged in a world-shaking great struggle—launching a revolutionary criticism against the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

"We are the critics of the old world!" This is the great resolve and heroic spirit of the broad masses of the Chinese people. The surging torrent of revolutionary criticism has made those political mediocrities stare in amazement and has struck fear into the hearts of imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries.

This unprecedentedly large-scale revolutionary criticism is a great historical task facing us, a decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, and a key to consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration.

The biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the Peng Dehuai anti-revolutionary revisionist clique are sworn enemies of the dictatorship of the proletariat. To remove their posts, dismiss their official positions, and seize their power has required a hard struggle; to criticize them politically, ideologically, and theoretically and to make them stink forever, leaving them no chance to rise again, is an even more arduous and serious struggle.

Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The representatives of all exploiting classes are always studying strategies to deal with us, 'observing the direction,' in order to achieve their ends. Sometimes they will 'play dead' and lie down, waiting for an opportunity to 'counterattack.' The recent 'confession' put forward by the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, which is actually a counterattack in the guise of repentance, has not once again taught many of our comrades a lesson?!

Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the struggle between capitalist restoration and proletarian anti-restoration is always present. If we do not carry out revolutionary criticism and thoroughly eliminate the poison of revisionism, the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the Peng Dehuai anti-revolutionary revisionist clique will use every means to come out and rehabilitate themselves; even if they fail to rehabilitate themselves, future representatives of the bourgeoisie will rehabilitate them and carry out counter-revolutionary restoration. The traitor of the proletariat, Trotsky, died decades ago, but the Khrushchev revisionist clique still rehabilitated him; after the old right opportunist Peng Dehuai was dismissed from his post, China's Khrushchev and the old Beijing Municipal Committee anti-revolutionary revisionist leader Peng Dehuai still attempted to rehabilitate him. Should we not draw profound lessons from this?!

This unprecedentedly large-scale revolutionary criticism is a general offensive against the old world, a thorough sweep of the decaying ideology of the exploiting classes, and a decisive battle to clear away the heap of garbage of all kinds of revisionism.

Chairman Mao often stresses: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without dredging, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." Only by thoroughly criticizing and sweeping away the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of all exploiting classes for thousands of years and reforming all the superstructures that do not fit the socialist economic base, can we establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought and establish the new ideas, new culture, new customs, and new habits of the proletariat, further realizing the revolutionization of people's thinking. Otherwise, we cannot completely overthrow the ruling position of the exploiting classes in the ideological realm and consolidate and strengthen the ruling position of the proletariat.

Marx and Engels pointed out in the Communist Manifesto: "The communist revolution is the most radical rupture with traditional property relations; it is no wonder that in its course it must also carry out the most radical rupture with traditional ideas." Revolutionary criticism is precisely for carrying out the most radical rupture with old traditional ideas, firmly establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and allowing Mao Zedong Thought to occupy all ideological positions, laying the ideological foundation for the realization of great communism.

This unprecedentedly large-scale revolutionary criticism is a great furnace for cultivating and forging millions upon millions of reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Chairman Mao said: "The successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause are produced in the struggle of the masses and grow in the tempering of great revolutionary storms and stresses." In his famous article "Introduction to a Cooperative," he mentioned a poem by the Qing Dynasty poet Gong Zizhen: "The vitality of the nine provinces depends on wind and thunder, and it is a pity that all horses are silent. I advise the heavens to shake off the dust and not to confine the talents to one mold." The proletarian cultural revolution mass movement, this "heaven," has forged tens of millions of "talents." A large number of previously unknown revolutionary youths have become brave pioneers. They have courage and wisdom. They are the vanguard of this proletarian cultural revolution.

Over the past year, millions of Red Guards have followed the great leader Chairman Mao with loyalty and devotion. They fear neither heaven nor earth, have thoroughly criticized the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, have thoroughly criticized the bourgeois reactionary line, and have thoroughly criticized all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits, making immortal contributions to the proletarian cultural revolution.

The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are the main force of revolutionary criticism. They hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and "charge" onto the battlefield. This is the fundamental guarantee that this revolutionary criticism will achieve thorough victory. Red Guard youths should humbly learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, unite with them, and fight shoulder to shoulder with them.

"Unlimited beauty lies on the perilous peak." We hope that the Red Guard youths, in the course of revolutionary criticism, will be good at thinking, learn to criticize politically, ideologically, and theoretically, make new contributions, and temper themselves into reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

More than a hundred years ago, the great teacher Marx and Engels issued a thunderous call: "Workers of the world, unite!" Comrades in the proletarian revolutionary cause, all revolutionary comrades, let us unite, let us unite, and strive bravely to complete this great historical task of revolutionary criticism!

### 伟大的历史任务

    伟大的历史任务
    在我们英雄祖国九百六十万平方公里的土地上，亿万革命人民按照天才统帅毛主席的战略部署，正在进行一场震撼世界的伟大战斗——对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派展开革命的大批判。
    “我们是旧世界的批判者！”这是广大中国人民的壮志豪情。革命大批判的滚滚洪流，使那些政治庸人为之目瞪口呆，使帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派为之胆颤心惊。
    这场空前规模的革命大批判，是摆在我们面前的伟大历史任务，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大决战，是巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的关键。
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和彭真反革命修正主义集团，是无产阶级专政的死敌。撤他们的职，罢他们的官，夺他们的权，是经过一番艰苦斗争的；从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批倒、批垮、批臭，叫他们遗臭万年，永无翻身之日，则是更加艰巨、更加严重的斗争。
    毛主席早就指出：各种剥削阶级的代表人物“老是在研究对付我们的策略，‘窥测方向’，以求一逞。有时他们会‘装死躺下’，等待时机，‘反攻过去’。”党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派最近抛出来的名为“认罪”、实为反攻的“检查”书，不是再一次从反面教育了我们许多同志吗？！
    在无产阶级专政条件下，资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争是始终存在的。如果我们不搞革命的大批判，不彻底清除修正主义的流毒，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和彭真反革命修正主义集团，是千方百计要出来为自己翻案的；即使他们自己翻案不成，将来，新出现的资产阶级代表人物还会为他们翻案，实行反革命复辟。无产阶级的可耻叛徒托洛茨基死了几十年以后，赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团还为之翻案；老牌右倾机会主义分子彭德怀被罢官以后，中国的赫鲁晓夫和旧北京市委反革命修正主义头子彭真也还妄图为之翻案。难道我们不应该从中吸取深刻的教训吗？！
    这场空前规模的革命大批判，是向旧世界发动的一次总攻击，是对剥削阶级腐朽意识形态的一次大扫荡，是清除形形色色的修正主义垃圾堆的一场攻坚战。
    毛主席经常强调：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。只有大破几千年来一切剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯，改革一切不适应社会主义经济基础的上层建筑，才能大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，大立无产阶级的新思想、新文化、新风俗、新习惯，进一步实现人的思想革命化。否则，我们就不能在意识形态领域中完全推翻剥削阶级的统治地位，巩固和加强无产阶级的统治地位。
    马克思、恩格斯在《共产党宣言》中指出：“共产主义革命就是同传统的所有制关系实行最彻底的决裂；毫不奇怪，它在自己的发展进程中要同传统的观念实行最彻底的决裂。”革命的大批判，正是为了同旧的传统观念实行最彻底的决裂，大树特树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，让毛泽东思想占领一切思想阵地，为实现伟大的共产主义奠定思想基础。
    这场空前规模的革命大批判，是培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业可靠接班人的大熔炉。
    毛主席说：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”他老人家在《介绍一个合作社》这篇著名的文章中，曾经提到清代诗人龚自珍的一首诗：“九州生气恃风雷，万马齐喑究可哀。我劝天公重抖擞，不拘一格降人材。”无产阶级文化大革命群众运动这个“天公”，造就了数以千百万计的“人材”。一大批本来不出名的革命青少年成了勇敢的闯将。他们有魄力、有智慧。他们是这次无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋。
    一年来，千百万红卫兵小将，紧紧跟着伟大的领袖毛主席，赤胆忠心干革命。他们天不怕，地不怕，大造了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造了资产阶级反动路线的反，大造了一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的反，为无产阶级文化大革命立下了不朽的功勋。
    广大工农兵是革命大批判的主力军，他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，“杀”上战场，是这场革命大批判必将取得彻底胜利的根本保证。红卫兵小将应该虚心地向工农兵学习，同工农兵结合，和工农兵并肩战斗。
    “无限风光在险峰”。我们希望红卫兵小将，在革命的大批判中，要善于思索，学会从政治上、思想上、理论上的批判，作出新的贡献，把自己锻炼成无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
    一百多年以前，伟大的导师马克思和恩格斯发出了惊天动地的号召：“全世界无产者，联合起来！”无产阶级革命派的战友们，一切革命的同志们，让我们联合起来，团结起来，为完成革命大批判这个伟大的历史任务而英勇奋斗！　（七月十九日）
