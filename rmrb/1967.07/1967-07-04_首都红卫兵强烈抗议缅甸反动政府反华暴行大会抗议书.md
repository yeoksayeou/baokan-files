More than ten thousand revolutionary fighters from the capital's Red Guards and the revolutionary faction of the proletariat in the arts and literature held a rally today. With hearts filled with indignation, we vehemently condemn and protest the extremely brutal anti-China fascist atrocities perpetrated by the reactionary government of Ne Win in Burma!

We vehemently condemn and protest the reactionary government of Ne Win in Burma for inciting a small group of fascist thugs to viciously insult our most beloved leader, Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese people and the people of the world!

We vehemently condemn and protest the reactionary government of Ne Win in Burma for directing a small group of fascist thugs to violently attack our embassy in Burma and other Chinese institutions, injuring our diplomatic personnel and killing our experts sent to aid Burma!

We vehemently condemn and protest the reactionary government of Ne Win in Burma for systematically persecuting our patriotic overseas Chinese, looting and burning Chinese residential areas and Chinese organizations, and massively arresting and slaughtering our patriotic overseas Chinese!

This unprecedentedly serious anti-China fascist atrocity was entirely planned and organized by the Burmese fascist leader Ne Win and his reactionary government. The Burmese people and the people of the whole world have seen it with their own eyes, and they cannot deny it.

The Burmese fascist leader Ne Win and his reactionary government's rampant anti-China and anti-Chinese policies are not accidental. After a small group of reactionary military officers, including Ne Win, seized power through a military coup in 1962, they have consistently pursued anti-communist and anti-people reactionary policies, implementing extreme fascist rule, ruthlessly exploiting and oppressing the Burmese people, leading to economic stagnation and widespread suffering. The people's resistance has grown increasingly strong. Workers are striking, students are boycotting classes, and the revolutionary flames are burning brighter every day. Under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party, the revolutionary armed struggle is developing. Ne Win's reactionary government is like sitting on top of a volcano, having a very hard time. Especially with the unprecedented influence of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the widespread dissemination of the great thoughts of Chairman Mao, which have greatly supported and inspired the revolutionary people of the world. This makes Ne Win and his reactionary clique even more restless, feeling that their end is near. Therefore, they have resorted to desperate measures, stirring up an anti-China wave, attempting to incite reactionary nationalist sentiments to cover up the acute class contradictions at home, divert the attention of the Burmese people, and thereby strike and weaken the strength and influence of the Burmese Communist Party, extinguishing the revolutionary flames of the Burmese people.

The reactionary government of Ne Win in Burma's frenzied anti-China actions have completely stripped off its hypocritical mask, fully exposing its vicious fascist dictatorship's counter-revolutionary nature, revealing that it has degenerated into a tool of American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism's anti-China and anti-communist policies.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' is a Chinese idiom used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are just such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the long run, only promote more extensive and more violent revolutions among the people." The reactionary government of Ne Win, which is anti-communist and anti-people domestically and pro-American, pro-Soviet revisionist, and anti-China internationally, can only play with fire and hasten its own doom.

The friendship between the peoples of China and Burma was developed in the struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism, and this is something that no one can destroy. The reactionary government of Ne Win's frenzied anti-China actions are a serious violation of the interests and wishes of the Burmese people. Such retrograde actions will inevitably face even more intense opposition from the broad masses of the Burmese people.

Now, the Burmese fascist leader Ne Win and the reactionary government he controls are obstinately continuing their anti-China actions, and the atrocities of persecuting overseas Chinese are spreading to some small and medium-sized cities in Burma. We are closely monitoring the developments. The anti-China rants of the Burmese fascist leaders like Ne Win are nothing but "a few flies banging against a wall, buzzing a few times, wailing a few times, and sobbing a few times." They are nothing to be afraid of! We solemnly warn the reactionary government of Ne Win in Burma: Seven hundred million Chinese people are not to be insulted! Seven hundred million Chinese people are not to be trifled with! Seven hundred million Chinese people keep their word!

We, the broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary cultural warriors in the capital, who are uniting to launch a fierce attack on the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, harbor deep hatred for all reactionaries at home and abroad. We stand united, and together with the people of the whole country, we resolutely support the stern position of our country's government. We vow to be a powerful backing for our countrymen in Burma and patriotic overseas Chinese in their struggle against violence. We firmly demand:

1. The reactionary government of Burma must guarantee that our overseas Chinese and the Burmese people have the sacred and inviolable right to study, propagate, and defend the great thoughts of Mao Zedong. They must not interfere with or obstruct the wearing of Chairman Mao's badges in the future.

2. The reactionary government of Burma must severely punish the murderers of our experts sent to aid Burma and our patriotic overseas Chinese; those who kill must pay with their lives, and blood debts must be repaid with blood. They must also compensate the families of the victims and be responsible for the treatment of the injured. They must return all stolen property and compensate for all losses.

3. The reactionary government of Burma must immediately release the detained overseas Chinese, lift the armed siege of our embassy and the residential areas of overseas Chinese, and ensure the safety of all personnel of our embassy and other institutions and all overseas Chinese. They must take effective measures to immediately stop all anti-China and anti-Chinese fascist atrocities.

4. The reactionary government of Burma must immediately take effective measures to ensure the legal rights of the personnel of the Chinese embassy in Burma and other Chinese institutions to engage in diplomatic activities and to ensure the normal activities of overseas Chinese. They must not harm them in any way.

5. The reactionary government of Burma must publicly apologize to the Chinese government and the Chinese people, and to the broad masses of overseas Chinese in Burma, and must absolutely guarantee that there will be no more anti-China and anti-Chinese incidents in the future. Otherwise, the reactionary government of Burma will bear all the serious consequences. Do not say that you were not warned!

Down with American imperialism!
Down with Soviet modern revisionism!
Down with the Burmese reactionaries! Down with Ne Win!
The revolutionary factions of the proletariat unite, and smash all reactionaries at home and abroad!
Long live the invincible thoughts of Mao Zedong!
Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the great leader of the Chinese people and the people of the world, Chairman Mao!

　　首都红卫兵强烈抗议缅甸反动政府反华暴行大会抗议书
    我们首都红卫兵和文艺界无产阶级革命派十多万名革命战士，今天举行集会，以无比愤怒的心情，最最强烈地声讨和抗议缅甸奈温反动政府制造的极端残暴的反华法西斯暴行！
    我们最最强烈地声讨和抗议缅甸奈温反动政府唆使一小撮法西斯暴徒，恶毒地侮辱我们心中最红最红的红太阳、中国人民和世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席！
    我们最最强烈地声讨和抗议缅甸奈温反动政府指挥一小撮法西斯暴徒，疯狂地袭击我驻缅使馆和其他中国机构，打伤我外交人员，杀害我援缅专家！
    我们最最强烈地声讨和抗议缅甸奈温反动政府大规模地迫害我爱国侨胞，抢劫和焚烧华侨居民区和华侨团体，大肆逮捕和屠杀我爱国侨胞！
    这一空前严重的反华法西斯暴行，是缅甸法西斯总头目奈温和他的反动政府一手策划、一手组织的，缅甸人民和全世界人民有目共睹，他们想赖是赖不掉的。
    缅甸法西斯总头目奈温及其反动政府猖狂地反华排华，绝不是偶然的。奈温等一小撮反动军人一九六二年靠发动军事政变上台以后，对内一贯奉行反共反人民的反动政策，实行极端的法西斯统治，残酷掠夺和压迫缅甸人民，弄得全国经济萧条，民不聊生，遭到了广大人民越来越强烈的反抗。工人罢工、学生罢课，革命烈火，越烧越旺。在缅甸共产党的领导下，革命的武装斗争正在不断发展。奈温反动政府有如坐在火山顶上，日子很不好过。特别是中国史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响和伟大的毛泽东思想的广泛传播，给予世界革命人民以极大的支持和鼓舞。这就使得奈温这些反动家伙更加坐卧不安，感到末日就要来临。于是，他们狗急跳墙，掀起了反华浪潮，妄图以煽动反动的民族主义情绪，来掩盖国内尖锐的阶级矛盾，转移缅甸人民的视线，借此打击和削弱缅甸共产党的力量和影响，扑灭缅甸人民的革命烈火。
    缅甸奈温反动政府的疯狂反华，彻底撕去了它伪善的面目，充分暴露了它穷凶极恶的法西斯专政的反革命本质，暴露了它已经堕落成为美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义反华反共的工具。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”奈温反动政府，对内反共反人民，对外亲美帝、联苏修、反中国，只能是玩火自焚，加速自己的灭亡。
    中缅两国人民的友谊是在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争中发展起来的，这是任何人破坏不了的。奈温反动政府疯狂反华，是严重违反了缅甸人民的利益和愿望，这种倒行逆施，必然要遭到缅甸广大人民更加激烈的反对。
    现在，缅甸法西斯总头目奈温和他把持下的反动政府一意孤行，仍然继续反华，迫害华侨的暴行正在向缅甸的一些中小城镇蔓延。我们密切注视着事态的发展。缅甸法西斯头目奈温之流的反华叫嚣，不过是“几个苍蝇碰壁。嗡嗡叫，几声凄厉，几声抽泣”，它没有什么了不起！我们严正警告缅甸奈温反动政府：七亿中国人民不可侮！七亿中国人民是不好惹的！七亿中国人民说话是算数的！同七亿中国人民为敌决没有好下场！
    我们首都正在联合起来向中国的赫鲁晓夫和党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火的广大红卫兵和革命文艺战士，对中外一切反动派都充满了刻骨仇恨。我们同仇敌忾，和全国人民一道，最坚决地拥护我国政府的严正立场，誓作坚持抗暴斗争的我国驻缅人员和爱国侨胞的强大后盾。我们坚决要求：
    一、毛泽东思想是当代马克思列宁主义的最高峰，我侨胞和缅甸人民学习、宣传和捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想，无限热爱世界人民伟大领袖毛主席，佩戴毛主席像章，是神圣不可侵犯的权利，缅甸反动政府必须保证今后不得横加阻挠和干涉。
    二、缅甸反动政府必须严惩杀害我援缅专家和爱国侨胞的凶手，杀人者偿命，血债要用血来还；必须抚恤受害者的家属，负责对受伤者进行治疗；必须归还一切抢走的东西；赔偿一切损失。
    三、缅甸反动政府必须立即释放被捕华侨，解除对我使馆和华侨居住区的武装包围，切实保证我国使馆和其他机构人员和全体华侨的安全，采取有效措施，立即制止一切反华排华的法西斯暴行。
    四、缅甸反动政府必须立即采取有效措施，切实保证中国驻缅使馆和中国其他机构人员从事外交活动的合法权利，切实保证华侨的一切正常活动，不准再动他们一根毫毛。
    五、缅甸反动政府必须向中国政府和中国人民，向缅甸广大华侨公开认罪、赔礼道歉，绝对保证今后不再发生反华排华事件，否则，一切严重后果由缅甸反动政府全部承担。勿谓言之不预也！
    打倒美帝国主义！
    打倒苏联现代修正主义！
    打倒缅甸反动派！打倒奈温！
    无产阶级革命派联合起来，打倒中外一切反动派！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    中国人民和世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    首都红卫兵强烈抗议缅甸反动政府反华暴行大会
                            一九六七年七月三日
