The heroic Albanian working people, following the guidance of the Party of Labor and Comrade Enver Hoxha, have, under the conditions of being surrounded by imperialism and modern revisionism, raised high the revolutionary red flag of Marxism-Leninism, actively carried out the movement for ideological revolutionization, and achieved outstanding results in completing and overfulfilling the first half-year production plan for this year. According to a bulletin issued by the Albanian State Statistical Bureau on the 23rd, the completion of the state production plan for the first half of this year in Albania is better than at any other time.

The bulletin said that in the first half of this year, the total industrial output value of Albania's industrial production plan was completed at 103%, an increase of 13% over the same period last year. Among them, the production of petroleum, coal, and chromium increased by 12%, the electric power industry increased by 49%, the machinery industry increased by 31%, and the light industry increased by 26%.

The bulletin said that the workers in the geological exploration sector have achieved good results in exploring new mineral resources, ensuring the mining of chromium, copper, and nickel iron ore.

The bulletin said that through further carrying out the initiative of revolutionization and the movement of creative technical innovation and rationalization suggestions, many complex problems in production technology have been solved. Under the initiative of the working masses, a number of new factories and workshops have been established, and a number of new products have been produced to replace some of the products and equipment that were previously needed to be imported.

The bulletin said that in these six months, agricultural workers have achieved further progress in land reclamation, spring plowing, and summer harvesting. By June 30, the annual plan for land reclamation has been completed by 85%, and many districts have completed their annual land reclamation plan in six months. The area of crops sown nationwide has increased by 4% compared to the same period last year.

The bulletin pointed out that Albanian farmers, following the Party and Comrade Hoxha's guidance on achieving agricultural collectivization, have voluntarily established agricultural production cooperatives in mountainous areas that have not yet been collectivized. Thus, the complete collectivization of agriculture has been realized. With the full support of the Party and the government, the newly established agricultural production cooperatives in the mountains are being further consolidated in terms of organization and economy.

The procurement plan for agricultural products has also been completed and overfulfilled.

The bulletin pointed out that in the first half of this year, outstanding achievements have also been made in transportation, construction installation, and commodity turnover.

The bulletin finally pointed out that the achievements made in executing the tasks of the state plan for the first half of this year are a prominent manifestation of the selfless and creative labor of the Albanian working people, a prominent manifestation of the unity of the people with the Party, and a prominent manifestation of the wise leadership of the Party of Labor and its Central Committee headed by Comrade Hoxha and the correct line of Marxism-Leninism.

    积极开展思想革命化运动  大力促进工农业生产
    阿尔巴尼亚人民超额完成上半年生产计划
    新华社地拉那二十三日电　英雄的阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民，遵循劳动党和霍查同志的教导，在帝国主义和现代修正主义包围的条件下，高举马克思列宁主义的革命红旗，积极开展思想革命化运动，在完成和超额完成今年上半年生产计划方面取得了出色成绩。据阿尔巴尼亚国家统计局二十三日发表的公报说，阿尔巴尼亚今年上半年的国家生产计划完成情况比以往任何时候都好。
    公报说，今年上半年阿尔巴尼亚工业总产值计划完成百分之一百零三，比去年同期增长了百分之十三，其中石油、煤和铬的生产都增长了百分之十二，电力工业增长了百分之四十九，机械工业增长了百分之三十一，轻工业增长了百分之二十六。
    公报说，地质勘探部门的职工在发掘新的矿源方面取得了良好的成就，保证了铬、铜和镍铁矿的开采。
    公报说，由于进一步开展了革命化倡议和创造性技术革新和合理化建议运动，解决了许多生产技术中的复杂问题。在劳动群众倡议下，建立了一批新的工厂和车间，生产了一批新的产品，以代替一部分过去需要进口的产品和设备。
    公报说，在这六个月期间，农业劳动者在开荒、春耕和夏收等方面，取得了进一步的成绩。截止六月三十日，开荒的年度计划已经完成百分之八十五，许多区在六个月中就完成了年度的开荒计划。全国播种面积比去年同期增长了百分之四。
    公报指出，阿尔巴尼亚农民遵循党和霍查同志关于实现农业集体化的教导，在尚未集体化的山区自愿建立了农业生产合作社。从而实现了农业的完全合作化。在党和政府的全面支援下，山区新成立的农业生产合作社在组织和经济上正得到进一步巩固。
    农产品的收购计划也已完成和超额完成。
    公报指出，今年上半年，在交通运输、建筑安装、商品周转等方面，也取得了出色的成绩。
    公报最后指出，在执行今年上半年国家计划任务时所取得的成就，是阿尔巴尼亚劳动人民忘我的和创造性劳动的显著证明，是人民同党的团结，以及劳动党及其以霍查同志为首的中央委员会的英明领导和马克思列宁主义正确路线的显著证明。
