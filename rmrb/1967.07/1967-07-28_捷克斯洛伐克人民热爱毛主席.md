Chairman Mao is the most red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people, and he is also the most red sun in the hearts of the people of Czechoslovakia. During our stay in Czechoslovakia, we have seen and heard many vivid examples of the Czech people's love for Chairman Mao.

There is an old farmer in his seventies who has visited China several times and has deep feelings for the Chinese people. He has immense respect and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao. Last July, when the news of Chairman Mao's swim in the Yangtze River reached Czechoslovakia, the Czech people were also overjoyed by Chairman Mao's health and cheered for his swim in the Yangtze River. This old man, carrying two baskets of fruit, traveled from a place more than sixty kilometers away to the Chinese Embassy in Prague. When he saw our embassy colleagues, he held the fruit with both hands, extremely excited, and said, "Hearing the news of Chairman Mao's swim in the Yangtze River, I am overjoyed. This is indeed a great joy for the revolutionary people of the whole world. I am here to congratulate Chairman Mao. I sincerely wish Chairman Mao a long life! Long live Chairman Mao!"

Chairman Mao teaches us that where there is oppression, there is resistance. The people of Czechoslovakia deeply understand that only by taking Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon and engaging in unyielding struggle can they achieve revolutionary victory. In search of truth and Mao Zedong Thought, they fear neither violence nor imprisonment.

There was a seventeen-year-old young shop assistant who, risking imprisonment and execution, went to our embassy three times to learn about the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country and to seek the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought. The first time he came out of the embassy, he obtained a portrait of Chairman Mao, which he treasured like a precious gem. However, in Czechoslovakia, loving Chairman Mao is considered a crime, and hanging a portrait of Chairman Mao is illegal. This seventeen-year-old youth has deep class feelings for Chairman Mao. To see Chairman Mao every day, he secretly pasted the portrait of Chairman Mao inside his wardrobe. Once, it was accidentally discovered and taken away by the shop owner, who reported it to the police. This youth, because of his love for the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, was expelled from the shop. However, in search of truth, he bravely broke through layers of blockade and obstruction and came to the embassy again. He said, "They can take away the portrait of Chairman Mao from my hands, but they can never take away the Mao Zedong Thought imprinted in my mind. Even if they expel me, I will still make the revolution." He again obtained many materials about the Cultural Revolution and badges of Chairman Mao from the embassy. But as soon as he walked out of the embassy gate, he was stopped by the revisionist police waiting at the door, who conducted an illegal search on him and arrested him. He was beaten and detained for forty-eight hours. The revisionists did not give him food or water, and finally kicked him out. However, this seventeen-year-old youth, with deep hatred for the revisionists and boundless love for Chairman Mao, brought three comrades and, risking even greater danger, came to the embassy again. When he saw the Chinese comrades, he said with deep hatred, "Let them starve, let them beat me, I am not afraid, I am not afraid of anything! I will follow Chairman Mao forever!"

Chairman Mao teaches us, "Being opposed by the enemy is a good thing, not a bad thing." Today, the Czechoslovak revisionist clique brutally tears up the Sino-Czechoslovak cultural cooperation agreement, deliberately sabotages the friendship between the two peoples, worsens the relations between the two countries, and unreasonably deprives our students of their right to study in Czechoslovakia. This arrogant anti-China action proves that their days are numbered. They do this out of their reactionary nature as revisionists, because they fear the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, fear the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and fear the Red Guard movement in China. What they do can only awaken the people of Czechoslovakia to struggle against them earlier and accelerate their downfall.

    捷克斯洛伐克人民热爱毛主席
    归国留学生红卫兵
    毛主席是中国人民心中最红最红的红太阳，也是捷克斯洛伐克人民心中最红最红的红太阳。我们在捷克斯洛伐克留学期间，曾经看到和听到过捷克斯洛伐克人民热爱毛主席的生动的事例。
    有一位七十多岁的老农民，曾几次访问过中国，对中国人民有着深厚的感情，对我们伟大的领袖毛主席无比的敬仰和崇拜。去年七月，当毛主席畅游长江的消息传到捷克斯洛伐克以后，捷克斯洛伐克人民也为毛主席的健康而高兴，为毛主席畅游长江而欢呼。这位七十多岁的老人，提着两篮水果，专程从六十多公里的外地赶到布拉格中国大使馆。当他见到我使馆同志时，双手捧着水果，万分激动地说：“听到毛主席畅游长江的消息，我高兴极了。这真是全世界革命人民的一件大喜事。我是来向毛主席祝贺的，我衷心地祝愿毛主席他老人家万寿无疆！万寿无疆！”
    毛主席教导我们，哪里有压迫，哪里就有反抗。捷克斯洛伐克人民深深地懂得只有以毛泽东思想为武器，进行坚持不懈的斗争，才能取得革命的胜利。为了寻求真理，寻求毛泽东思想，他们不畏强暴，不怕杀头坐牢。
    有一个十七岁的青年店员，曾三次冒着坐牢杀头的危险到我大使馆了解我国无产阶级文化大革命的情况，寻求伟大的真理毛泽东思想。第一次从使馆出来，他得到了一张毛主席像，真是如获至宝，爱护备至。但是，在捷克斯洛伐克，人民热爱毛主席是“有罪”的，挂毛主席像是“犯法”的。这位十七岁的青年，对毛主席怀有深厚的阶级感情。为了能天天看到毛主席，他偷偷地把毛主席像贴在衣柜里。一次不小心被店主发现抢走了，并报告了公安局。这位青年，由于热爱世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席，竟被店里开除，但是，为了寻求真理，他又第二次勇敢地冲破层层封锁和阻拦，来到我使馆。他说：“他们能抢走我手里的毛主席像，但他们却无论如何也抢不走我印在脑子里的毛泽东思想。把我开除了，我还是要干革命。”他又从使馆索取了许多关于文化大革命的材料和毛主席像章。但当他刚走出我使馆大门时，就被守在门口的捷修警察拦住了，对他进行了非法的搜查，并把他逮捕了。他遭到了毒打，被关了四十八小时。捷修不给他饭吃，不给他水喝，最后又一脚把他踢了出去。可是，这个十七岁的青年人，怀着对捷修的刻骨仇恨，满怀对毛主席的无比热爱，又带着三个伙伴，冒着更大的危险再次来到我大使馆。当他见到中国同志时，满腔愤恨地说：“让他们饿吧，让他们打吧，我不怕，我什么都不怕！跟着毛主席我是跟定了！”
    毛主席教导我们：“被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事。”今天，捷修当局粗暴地撕毁中捷文化合作协定，蓄意破坏中捷两国人民的友谊，恶化两国关系，无理剥夺我留学生在捷学习的权利。这种猖狂反华的行动，证明他们的日子越来越不好过了。他们这样做，是出于他们修正主义的反动本性，是因为他们害怕战无不胜的毛泽东思想，害怕中国的无产阶级文化大革命，害怕中国的红卫兵运动。他们这样做，只能激起捷克斯洛伐克人民更早地觉醒起来和他们斗争，加速他们的灭亡。
