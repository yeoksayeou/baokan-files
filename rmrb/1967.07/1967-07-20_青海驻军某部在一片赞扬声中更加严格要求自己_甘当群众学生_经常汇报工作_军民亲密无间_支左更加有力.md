Editor's Note: Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ridiculous, not understanding this point, we cannot gain even the most basic knowledge."

The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Qinghai Garrison, following Chairman Mao's teachings, maintain a humble and cautious attitude amidst praise, actively report their thoughts and work to the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations, setting a good example for the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army who are executing the "three supports, two militaries" tasks, and for revolutionary cadres and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations.

Believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and always following the mass line is the starting point for doing everything well. Regularly reporting thoughts and work to the masses is a good way to follow the mass line. This way, mutual understanding can be enhanced, consensus can be reached, and unity can be achieved, promoting the development of work. This way, the wisdom of the masses can be concentrated, their boundless creativity can be unleashed, and the Party's policies can truly become the conscious actions of the masses. This way, self-awareness can be developed to accept the supervision of the masses from below, promoting ideological transformation and constantly changing one's worldview.

Humility leads to progress, arrogance leads to backwardness. Always remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, always be one with the masses, and our cause will be invincible.

A Certain Unit of the Qinghai Garrison Strictly Requires Itself Amidst Praise

	Acts as a Student of the Masses and Regularly Reports Work
	Military and Civilians Are Close, Supporting the Left is More Effective

	XINHUA NEWS AGENCY, XINING - The officers and soldiers of a certain unit of the Qinghai Garrison, stationed in the Xining Bright Dawn Chemical Factory and other units to carry out the task of supporting the left, follow Chairman Mao's teachings on believing in and relying on the masses. With the spirit of being a humble student, they frequently report the activities and arrangements of the army's support for the left to the core leadership of the proletarian revolutionary factions, making them fully aware and gaining their trust and support, thus promoting the work of supporting the left.

	After entering the Bright Dawn Chemical Factory and other units, the officers and soldiers received a warm welcome from the "August 18" proletarian revolutionary factions and others. How to maintain a humble and cautious attitude amidst praise and do a good job of supporting the left? This was an important issue facing these officers and soldiers.

	At this time, the officers and soldiers studied Chairman Mao's teachings on "the masses are the real heroes" and "only by being a student of the masses can one be a teacher of the masses." Through study, they realized that the masses understand the situation of their units best. In the struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, they have the courage and experience, and are the best teachers. Only by putting down their airs, being humble students, and learning from them with an open mind, listening to their opinions and criticisms, can they better complete the glorious task of supporting the broad leftist masses given by the Party and Chairman Mao.

	At first, the soldiers often sought the opinions of the masses, and the masses all said they had no opinions to offer. Was it really that there were no opinions? On the one hand, they examined themselves, and on the other hand, they carefully observed, feeling that the masses were not without opinions, but some opinions were not brought up. This phenomenon caught their attention. They thought that although they had a good intention to learn from the masses, they had not truly gone deep into the masses, had not truly opened their hearts to the masses, and had not fully gained the trust of the masses. The masses were still in a stage of not understanding them. What should they do? They repeatedly studied the "Three Articles," carried out small rectification movements, and further examined themselves to see if they truly had the stance, thoughts, feelings, and revolutionary spirit of the left. At the same time, to better accept the supervision of the revolutionary masses, they launched activities to report to the proletarian revolutionary factions.

	In the reports, they clearly explained to the revolutionary factions the work arrangements, summaries, achievements, and shortcomings of each period. On the one hand, this made the revolutionary factions fully aware, and on the other hand, it facilitated reaching a consensus with the revolutionary factions, supplementing shortcomings in a timely manner, correcting mistakes, promoting achievements, and overcoming shortcomings. They also paid special attention to reporting their thoughts to the revolutionary factions, reporting their thoughts on eliminating selfishness and establishing public spirit, so that the revolutionary factions could understand what they were thinking, what progress they had made, and what shortcomings still existed. They sought the help of the revolutionary factions, enhanced mutual understanding, reached ideological consensus, and unified steps. For a period of time, a soldier of the People's Liberation Army, in order to help the deceived masses awaken, had more contact with some masses in the conservative organizations. Some revolutionary masses did not understand what he was doing and thought that the soldier's attitude was not clear. The soldier learned about this situation and the next day explained his thoughts to the revolutionary masses, and checked his shortcomings of not seeking the opinions of the revolutionary factions in advance. The revolutionary masses were very moved and actively worked with this soldier to do the work of awakening the deceived masses, greatly promoting the progress of the work.

	The officers and soldiers of this unit carrying out the task of supporting the left have made reporting to the masses a regular practice, holding meetings at regular or irregular intervals. The forms of reporting are diverse, combining large and small meetings, combining symposiums and individual heart-to-heart talks, and combining leading cadres and comrades doing specific work. In the past three months, just the leading comrades of this unit carrying out the task of supporting the left have reported to the leaders of the "August 18" revolutionary factions at the units they are stationed in four times. This approach is highly welcomed by the revolutionary factions. They said emotionally: "The PLA respects and is so humble to us, we trust and rely on them." The revolutionary factions regard the supporting-left units as confidants, and have no reservations in discussing anything with them or putting forward any opinions. Through reporting their thoughts and work to the revolutionary factions, the relationship between the military and the civilians has become even closer, making the army more smoothly, accurately, and effectively support the leftist masses. The supporting-left units deeply feel: "The process of reporting thoughts and work to the revolutionary factions is a process of humbly learning from the masses, constantly establishing a firm mass line consciousness, and transforming one's worldview. Only by firmly standing on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, being a humble student of the revolutionary masses, listening to the opinions of the revolutionary masses at any time, and being one with the revolutionary masses, can we give firm and unambiguous support to the proletarian revolutionary factions."

    青海驻军某部在一片赞扬声中更加严格要求自己
    甘当群众学生　经常汇报工作
    军民亲密无间　支左更加有力
    新华社西宁电　进驻西宁黎明化工厂等单位执行支左任务的人民解放军青海驻军某部的干部和战士，遵循毛主席有关相信群众、依靠群众的教导，以甘当小学生的精神，不断向无产阶级革命派的领导核心汇报部队支左工作的活动和安排，使他们摸到底，取得他们的信任和支持，促进了支左工作的开展。
    这个部队执行支左任务的干部战士进入黎明化工厂等单位后，受到“八·一八”等无产阶级革命派的热情欢迎。怎样在一片赞扬声中保持谦虚、谨慎的作风，做好支左工作？这是摆在这些干部战士面前的一个重要问题。
    在这时候，干部、战士们学习了毛主席“群众是真正的英雄”和“只有做群众的学生才能做群众的先生”的教导。干部、战士们通过学习认识到，群众最了解本单位的情况。在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作斗争中，他们有魄力，有胆量，积累了丰富的斗争经验，是自己最好的老师。自己只有放下架子，甘当小学生，虚心向他们学习，听取他们的意见和批评，才能更好地完成党和毛主席交给的支持左派广大群众的光荣任务。
    开始，指战员们多次征求群众的意见，群众都表示没有什么意见可提。真的一点意见也没有吗？他们一方面检查自己，一方面细心观察，觉得群众不是没有意见，而是有些意见没有提出来。这一现象，引起了他们的注意。他们认为，自己虽然有向群众学习的良好愿望，但还没有真正地深入到群众中去，还没有把自己的心真正交给群众，还没有充分取得群众的信任，群众对自己还是处在不了解的阶段。怎么办？他们就反复学习“老三篇”，开展小整风，进一步检查自己是否真正具备了左派的立场，左派的思想，左派的感情，左派的革命精神。同时，为了更好地接受革命群众的监督，他们又开展了向无产阶级革命派汇报的活动。
    在汇报中，他们把每一段时期的工作安排、工作总结、工作成绩、工作缺点都向革命派谈清楚，一方面使革命派心里有底，一方面便于同革命派取得一致意见，不足的地方及时补充，不对的地方及时改正，发扬成绩，克服缺点。他们还特别重视向革命派汇报自己的思想，汇报自己破私立公的思想活动，使革命派了解到自己在想着什么，有了哪些进步，还存在哪些缺点，争取他们的帮助，增强彼此的了解，取得思想一致，步调统一。有一个时期，一位解放军战士为了帮助受蒙蔽群众觉悟，与保守组织中的一些群众接触较多。有些革命群众不了解他在干什么，认为这个战士态度不鲜明。这个战士了解到这个情况，第二天就把自己的想法向革命群众交了底，并检查自己事前没有征求革命派意见的缺点，革命群众听了很受感动，主动和这个战士一起去做受蒙蔽群众的工作，大大促进了工作的进展。
    这个部队执行支左任务的干部战士，把向群众汇报作为一种制度，定期或不定期举行。汇报的形式是多种多样的，大会小会相结合，座谈会和个别谈心相结合，领导干部和做具体工作的同志相结合。三个月来，仅这个部队执行支左任务的领导同志，就向所驻单位的“八·一八”革命派各级负责人汇报了四次。这样做，深受革命派的欢迎。他们感动地说：“解放军对我们这样尊重，这样谦虚，我们信得过，靠得住。”革命派把支左部队当作知心人，有什么话也向他们谈，有什么意见，也毫无保留地提出来。通过向革命派汇报自己的思想和工作，军民之间的关系更加密切，使部队更顺利、更准确、更有力地支持了左派群众。支左部队深有感触地说：“向革命派汇报思想和工作的过程，就是虚心向群众学习，不断地树立坚定的群众观念、改造世界观的过程。只有坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上，甘当革命群众的小学生，随时听取革命群众的意见，与革命群众打成一片，才能给无产阶级革命派以坚定的、毫不含糊的支持。”
