A Polish merchant ship arrived at Qingdao Port in China to deliver goods. A Polish sailor saw one of our workers wearing a badge of our great leader Chairman Mao. Summoning his courage, he said to our worker: "We greatly admire Chairman Mao. Could you please buy me a Chairman Mao badge?" Our worker immediately gave him the badge he cherished. The sailor held the gleaming Chairman Mao badge in his hands, looking at it over and over, nodding repeatedly in gratitude. Then, he carefully wrapped the badge in a clean handkerchief and proudly said: "I now have a Chairman Mao badge. From now on, every time it's New Year, festivals, or weekends, I will wear it on my formal attire."

    我心爱毛主席像章
    一艘波兰商船来我国青岛港运货。一位波兰海员看见我工作人员戴着伟大导师毛主席的像章，他就鼓起勇气对我工作人员说：我们非常热爱毛主席，你能不能给我买一枚毛主席像章？我工作人员立即把自己心爱的像章赠给他。这个船员把金光闪闪的毛主席像章捧在手里，看了又看，连连点头表示感谢。接着，他小心地用洁净的手帕把毛主席像章包了起来，自豪地说：我有了毛主席像章了。今后，每逢过年过节，过星期天，我要把它戴在礼服上。
