The Progressive Labor Party of the USA recently distributed a pamphlet resolutely supporting the courageous struggle for violent self-defense by black people in Newark, USA, and calling on the American people to rise up against the bloody massacres of black people by American imperialism.

The pamphlet, titled "Support Our Brothers and Sisters in Newark," states: "Just as the American army is shooting and killing those who demand freedom and the right to determine their own fate in Vietnam, so too are the black people of Newark resisting with every object they can get their hands on. They say: 'We would rather stand and fight than kneel and beg for life.'"

The pamphlet points out that the living conditions of black people in the USA are extremely poor, with no decent schools, no jobs, and frequent beatings by the police. When black people protest against this slave-like existence, the US government sends in the National Guard to suppress them.

The pamphlet says, "We can no longer be oppressed. We must resist like the people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America resisting American imperialism."

In this pamphlet, the Progressive Labor Party of the USA finally calls on the American people to support the just struggle of black people in the USA with concrete actions.

The official newspaper of the Progressive Labor Party of the USA, "Challenge," recently published a special issue on the black struggle, enthusiastically praising the increasingly intense armed resistance of black people in the USA, condemning the bloody suppression of black people by the Johnson government, and calling on people of all countries to support the just struggle of black people in the USA.

"Challenge" said that, just as the black people of Harlem first took up violent self-defense in 1964 and the black people of Watts in 1965, the black people of Newark and other cities have recently joined the ranks of armed resistance. The newspaper pointed out: "They are defending themselves and their nation against the oppressive police, state police, and National Guard, against the system protected by these uniformed thugs. They are at the forefront of the great upsurge of the struggle and revolution against the oppressors of American imperialism in this country."

The newspaper continued: "Just as the heroic people of Vietnam, just as the heroic people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America, black people in the USA declare that they will fight for the liberation of their nation, no matter how unequal the forces, they will fight until they achieve complete liberation. No matter how desperately American imperialism struggles, it cannot suppress the fighting spirit of black people who are determined to gain freedom, and it cannot stop the liberation of black people with all its weapons."

"Challenge" emphasized that more and more white workers, students, and intellectuals in the USA are supporting and participating in this struggle of black people, because they personally see that the US government is the most corrupt and brutal government since Hitler's Germany. It said: "In fact, Johnson, McNamara, Rusk, and their henchmen have made the Nazis pale in comparison with their worldwide slaughter and plunder!"

"Challenge" said: "(The) black people have made the liberation of their nation and the right to determine their own future their goal. They have decided that they would rather stand and fight than kneel and live!"

"Challenge" finally calls on the people of all countries to support the just struggle of black people in the USA. It wrote: "Black people in the USA unite! Oppressed people of the world unite! Unite to defeat American imperialism!"

    美进步劳工党坚决支持黑人的暴力自卫斗争
    美国黑人将战斗到彻底解放
    号召美国人民和世界人民奋起反击美帝对黑人的屠杀
    新华社伦敦二十三日电　美国进步劳工党最近散发了一本小册子，坚决支持美国纽瓦克黑人的英勇暴力自卫斗争，并且号召美国人民起来反击美帝国主义对黑人的血腥屠杀。
    这本题为《支持我们的纽瓦克兄弟姐妹》的小册子说：“就象美国军队在越南一样，正在开枪和打死那些要求自由和要求决定自己命运的权利的人们。就象越南人民一样，纽瓦克的黑人正在用他们能够拿到的每个物件进行抵抗。他们说：‘宁愿站着战斗，也不愿跪着求生。’”
    小册子指出，美国黑人的居住条件十分恶劣，没有象样的学校，没有工作做，还要经常遭受警察的毒打。而当黑人抗议这种奴隶生活时，美国政府出动了国民警卫队加以镇压。
    小册子说，我们再也不能受压迫了，我们要象亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲人民反抗美帝国主义那样进行反抗。
    美国进步劳工党在这个小册子里最后号召美国人民以实际行动支持美国黑人的正义斗争。
    新华社伦敦二十五日电　美国进步劳工党机关报《挑战》报最近出版了黑人斗争专刊，热情赞扬美国黑人日益高涨的武力抗暴斗争，谴责约翰逊政府血腥镇压美国黑人的暴行，并号召各国人民支持美国黑人的正义斗争。
    《挑战》报说，正如一九六四年首先采取暴力自卫行动的哈莱姆黑人和一九六五年的瓦茨区黑人一样，最近纽瓦克等城市的黑人参加了武力抗暴斗争的行列。报纸指出：“他们正在保卫他们自己和他们的民族，反对实行镇压的警察、州警察和国民警卫队，反对这些穿着制服的打手所保护的制度。他们在这个国家（美国）掀起的反对美帝国主义压迫者的战斗和革命的大高潮中，走在最前列。”
    这家报纸继续说：“就象英雄的越南人民一样，就象英雄的亚非拉人民一样，美国黑人宣告，他们要为他们的民族解放而斗争，不管力量多么悬殊，他们要战斗到赢得彻底解放为止。不管美帝国主义怎样拚命挣扎，它压制不了决心要获得自由的黑人的日益高涨的战斗精神，它使用全部武器也阻挡不了黑人的解放。”
    《挑战》报强调指出，越来越多的美国白人工人、学生和知识分子支持并参加了美国黑人的这场斗争，因为他们亲自看到，美国政府是希特勒德国以后的最腐败、最残暴的政府。它说：“事实上，约翰逊、麦克纳马拉、腊斯克及其走狗在世界范围展开的屠杀和掠夺运动中，已使纳粹相形见绌！”
    《挑战》报说：“（美国）黑人已经把他们的民族解放和决定自己的未来的权利作为他们的目标。他们已经决定，宁肯立着战斗，也不跪着生！”
    《挑战》报最后号召各国人民支持美国黑人的正义斗争。它写道：“美国黑人联合起来！全世界被压迫人民联合起来！联合起来打败美帝国主义！”
