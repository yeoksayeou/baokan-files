The broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army Guizhou Provincial Military Region, in their support for agriculture, have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively helping the people in their struggle to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, launching a revolutionary criticism movement, eliminating the poison of revisionism, and firmly establishing Mao Zedong Thought. This has been warmly welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses.

Putting the Propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought at the Forefront of Agricultural Support Work

The broad cadres and fighters of the Guizhou Provincial Military Region went to the front lines of agricultural production during the busy spring planting season. Upon arriving at the agricultural support front, they placed the propaganda of Mao Zedong Thought and the arming of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants with Mao Zedong Thought at the forefront of all work. Their specific methods for helping the poor and lower-middle peasants to study and apply Chairman Mao's works are as follows: first, lead by example in study and application, setting a good example; second, establish night schools and political and cultural rooms for Mao Zedong Thought, helping to set up study organizations and study systems; third, help train study cadres and instructors. They have trained over 700,000 instructors for studying Chairman Mao's works in rural areas, with an average of more than three per production team; fourth, fully utilize the role of militiamen as backbone and bridge in study; fifth, establish a leadership system for studying Chairman Mao's works from top to bottom, stipulating that all levels of production leadership cadres must not only study well themselves but also regard leading the study of Chairman Mao's works as the most important task, higher than everything, greater than everything, preceding everything, and heavier than everything.

Vice Chairman Lin Biao said: "It is necessary to study and apply Chairman Mao's works to instill Mao Zedong Thought into workers and peasants, to change the spiritual face of the laboring people, and to transform spiritual power into tremendous material power." After studying Chairman Mao's works, the broad poor and lower-middle peasants have undergone a great change in their spiritual outlook, their revolutionary enthusiasm and political vigilance have greatly increased, and they have turned Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production" into conscious action. The chairman of the poor peasants' association in a commune in Meitan County, when a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road in the county committee incited him to lead peasants into the city to cause trouble, used Mao Zedong Thought as a political microscope to analyze the situation, immediately saw through the enemy's wolfish ambitions, and immediately repelled the enemy. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants all take the three shining examples in "Old Three Articles" as their learning models. They composed and sang: "Learn from Zhang Zedong, selfishness is not allowed; learn from Bai Qiu'en, firmly refuse to take crooked work points; learn from Old Yu Gong, charge forward despite great difficulties."

Launching a Revolutionary Criticism Movement to Eliminate the Poison of Revisionism

The units of the Guizhou Provincial Military Region in their agricultural support work have always placed revolution at the forefront. They believe that studying and applying Chairman Mao's works at present is to use Mao Zedong Thought to break old things and establish new things, launch a revolutionary criticism movement, thoroughly eliminate the poison of revisionism, and thus better mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses and promote social progress.

In response to the class struggle situation in rural areas, the cadres and fighters participating in agricultural support organized the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres to study Chairman Mao's statements on class and class struggle, and Chairman Mao's theory, line, principles, and policies on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They fully mobilized the masses to launch a powerful revolutionary criticism movement against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and combined this criticism movement with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their own regions and units. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants, in the fields and at the edges of the threshing grounds, united in condemning the heinous crimes of the biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party, greatly raising their class consciousness and awareness of line struggle. A certain unit of the Guizhou Provincial Military Region, in supporting the front lines of summer harvesting and planting, held thirteen mass meetings with the poor and lower-middle peasants in rural areas to denounce and criticize the biggest power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party, with over 10,000 participants. The cadres and fighters of the unit and the poor and lower-middle peasants, with their personal experiences, bitterly denounced the fallacies of China's Khrushchev such as "exploitation is meritorious," "three selfs and one package," and "four freedoms." The poor and lower-middle peasants said excitedly at the criticism meeting: "If we do not overthrow the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, revolutionary blood will flow again, the Long March will have to be walked again, land reform will have to be carried out again, and the socialist mountains and rivers will change color."

In the revolutionary criticism, the broad cadres and fighters of the Guizhou Provincial Military Region and the revolutionary masses also focused on criticizing the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie in the cadre issue of "striking a large area and protecting a small clique," mobilizing the enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary cadres.

Emphasizing Politics and Leading the Production Leadership Cadres

The units of the Guizhou Provincial Military Region responsible for agricultural support also dispatched a large number of cadres to help local areas establish various levels of front-line production command departments.

Chairman Mao said: "To ensure that our Party and state do not change color, we not only need a correct line and policy, but also need to cultivate and train tens of millions of successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution."

Following Chairman Mao's instructions, the units, when helping local areas establish production leadership cadres, first of all grasped the thought revolutionization of the cadres of the production command department. The comrades of the units organized them purposefully and planned to study the brilliant works such as "Old Three Articles," "On the Chongqing Negotiations," and "Carry the Revolution Through to the End," promoting them to break private interests and establish public interests, firmly and unswervingly act according to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and continuously improve their style of work. To ensure that various levels of production leadership cadres can truly emphasize politics, adhere to the "four firsts," carry forward the "March 8th" style, and guarantee the implementation of Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution and promote production," the broad cadres and fighters of the Guizhou Provincial Military Region supporting agriculture also helped various levels of production leadership cadres establish political institutions or full-time political workers, establish and improve the system of strengthening political and ideological work, eliminate the poison of revisionism spread by a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and thus make the various levels of leadership cadres appear in a new light.

    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装广大社员
    彻底肃清中国的赫鲁晓夫在农村的流毒
    贵州省军区在支农中充分发动群众开展声势浩大的革命大批判运动
    据新华社贵阳二十一日电　人民解放军贵州省军区广大指战员，在支农工作中，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，积极帮助人民群众在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，开展革命的大批判，清除修正主义的流毒，大立毛泽东思想，受到了广大革命群众的热烈欢迎。
    把宣传毛泽东思想放在支农工作的首位
    贵州省军区广大指战员，是在春耕生产大忙时节开赴农业生产第一线的。一到支农前线，他们就把宣传毛泽东思想、用毛泽东思想武装广大贫下中农的头脑，放在一切工作的首位。他们帮助贫下中农活学活用毛主席著作的具体方法是：一、带头学，带头用，做好样子；二、大办毛泽东思想夜校、政治文化室，帮助建立学习组织和学习制度；三、帮助培养学习骨干和辅导员。共为农村培训了七十多万名学习毛主席著作辅导员，平均每一生产队有三名以上；四、充分发挥民兵在学习中的骨干作用和桥梁作用；五、自上而下健全了学习毛主席著作的领导体系，规定各级生产领导班子，不但自己要学习好，而且把领导学习毛主席著作作为高于一切，大于一切，先于一切，重于一切的头等重要任务。
    林彪副主席说：“必须通过活学活用毛主席著作，把毛主席的思想灌输到工人、农民中去，才能改变劳动人民的精神面貌，才能使精神力量转化为巨大的物质力量。”广大贫下中农学习毛主席著作后，精神面貌发生了巨大的变化，革命积极性和政治警惕性大大提高，把毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，变成了自觉行动。湄潭县一个公社的贫协主任，当县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派唆使他带领农民进城闹事的时候，他用毛泽东思想这面政治上的显微镜一分析，马上看透了敌人的狼子野心，当即回击了敌人。广大贫下中农都以“老三篇”中的三个光辉形象作为自己学习的榜样，他们编顺口溜唱道：“学习张思德，自私自利要不得；学习白求恩，坚决不拿歪工分；学习老愚公，天大困难往前冲。”
    开展革命的大批判，肃清修正主义的流毒
    贵州省军区部队在支农工作中，始终把革命放在首位。他们认为，活学活用毛主席著作，在当前，就是要用毛泽东思想去破旧立新，开展革命的大批判运动，彻底清除修正主义的流毒，这样才能更好地调动广大群众的积极因素，推动社会前进。
    针对农村阶级斗争形势，参加支农的指战员们，组织贫下中农和革命干部，学习毛主席有关阶级和阶级斗争的论述，学习毛主席关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，充分发动群众，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开了一个声势浩大的革命的大批判运动，并且把这个大批判运动同本地区、本单位的斗批改结合了起来。广大贫下中农，在田头，在场边，同仇敌忾，齐声谴责党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行，大大提高了阶级觉悟和路线斗争的自觉性。贵州省军区某部在支援夏收夏种第一线中，同农村贫下中农社员一起，共同召开了控诉批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大会十三次，参加群众一万多人。部队指战员和贫下中农以切身的经历，痛斥中国的赫鲁晓夫的“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、“四大自由”等谬论。贫下中农在批判大会上激动地说：“不打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，革命鲜血要重流，万里长征要重走，土地改革要重来，社会主义江山要变色。”
    在革命的大批判中，贵州省军区广大指战员和革命群众还着重批判了在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，调动了广大革命干部的积极性。
    突出政治，带好生产领导班子
    贵州省军区担任支农的部队，还抽出大批干部帮助地方建立起各级生产第一线指挥部。
    毛主席说：“为了保证我们的党和国家不改变颜色，我们不仅需要正确的路线和政策，而且需要培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。”
    遵照毛主席的教导，部队在帮助地方建立生产领导班子时，头一件事就是抓生产指挥部干部本身的思想革命化，部队同志有目的、有计划地组织他们学习“老三篇”、《关于重庆谈判》、《将革命进行到底》等光辉著作，促进他们破私立公，坚定不移地按照毛主席的革命路线办事，不断改进自己的作风。为了使各级生产领导班子能真正做到突出政治，坚持“四个第一”，发扬“三八”作风，保证毛主席“抓革命，促生产”这一伟大方针的贯彻执行，贵州省军区支农的广大指战员还帮助各级生产领导班子设立了政治机构或专职的政治工作人员，建立和健全了加强政治思想工作的制度，清除了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派散布的见物不见人的修正主义的流毒，从而使得各级领导班子面貌一新。
