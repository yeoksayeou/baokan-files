The People's Production Brigade in Chengguan Commune, Pingba County, Guizhou, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, has been vigorously criticizing the living thoughts of the community members, mobilizing the broad masses of community members to launch a large-scale criticism movement. Through this criticism, they deeply felt that the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are not separated from them by thousands of miles and countless mountains; their poisonous fangs have already reached their doorsteps. The large-scale criticism is not just something that "literate people" do; it is a life-and-death struggle for the community members who wield hoes and for the people of the entire nation to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The poor and lower-middle peasants and militiamen of this brigade harbor deep hatred for the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They regard participating in the criticism of these bad elements as a top priority. However, at the beginning of the criticism, some community members thought that the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are thousands of miles away from Guizhou, separated by countless mountains and rivers, so whether they criticize or not seems to make little difference. Some community members said, "Our cultural and theoretical levels are low; large-scale criticism is something that literate people do." Others, while knowing that the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are big villains, were not clear about the poison they had spread or the evil deeds they had done, so they found it hard to criticize specifically.

In response to these living thoughts and actual situations, the brigade first publicly exposed the crimes of China's Khrushchev in opposing Mao Zedong Thought, opposing the dictatorship of the proletariat, destroying the collective economy, and restoring capitalism; at the same time, they organized community members to study relevant quotations from Chairman Mao and related editorials from the *Red Flag* magazine and the *People's Daily*, providing them with weapons for criticism. Thus, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants had a target in their sights and a powerful weapon in their hands—the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. A large-scale criticism and struggle quickly unfolded throughout the brigade. Many community members said, "These guys are so bold, daring to oppose our beloved red sun, Chairman Mao! We must resolutely overthrow them!" Many poor and lower-middle peasants, speaking from their own experiences, said excitedly, "In the past, we were like cattle and horses for the landlords, suffering from their exploitation and having barely enough to eat and wear, hating them to death. China's Khrushchev actually says that 'peasants welcome exploitation' and 'hiring labor is not exploitation,' which is infuriating!" "We have suffered enough bitterness for thousands of years. They still come up with all sorts of tricks, 'protecting the rich peasant economy,' promoting 'three freedoms and one contract,' 'four freedoms,' trying to make us go back on our path, suffer twice, which we will never allow!"

Agricultural production is busy, and residences are scattered, making it impossible to hold meetings frequently. The brigade, based on actual conditions, adopted a combination of large-scale criticism meetings and small-scale criticism meetings, and combined meeting criticism with daily discussions. Each meeting criticized one point.

Chairman Mao teaches us, "Only through comparison can one distinguish. Only through distinction and struggle can one develop." The People's Production Brigade, in the large-scale criticism movement, followed this teaching of Chairman Mao, focusing on several aspects of the crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road that are closely related to rural community members, such as "three freedoms and one contract," "four freedoms," and the theory of "extinguishing class struggle," opposing the emphasis on politics and opposing the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works. They used the "three comparisons" method to carry out in-depth criticism. The "three comparisons" are: comparing what Chairman Mao says with what China's Khrushchev says; comparing the poison spread by China's Khrushchev with the local situation; comparing the sweetness of socialism with the bitterness of the old society. For example, Chairman Mao teaches us, "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution." The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, however, do not distinguish between enemies and friends, advocating "class cooperation." Once the community members made this comparison, the evil face of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and opposing Mao Zedong Thought was exposed. Chairman Mao teaches us, "Only socialism can save China." China's Khrushchev, however, advocates "three freedoms and one contract." Once this comparison was made, the ugly face of China's Khrushchev, who dreams of restoring capitalism, was exposed.

Comparing what Chairman Mao says with what China's Khrushchev says is a good method for theoretical criticism. Comparing the poison spread by China's Khrushchev with the local situation is a good method for increasing the community members' sensory understanding of China's Khrushchev, this bad guy. During the criticism of "three freedoms and one contract," once compared with the local situation, many community members said: A few years ago, the power-holders in our locality who were taking the capitalist road advocated dividing the land among the community members. These were all influenced by the poison of China's Khrushchev. The root is with him; he is the arch-villain of the entire Chinese people. Although he is far away from us, separated by countless mountains and rivers, his poisonous fangs have already reached our doorsteps. This is the struggle between the two roads.

In the large-scale criticism, organizing the poor and lower-middle peasants to compare today's sweetness of socialism with the bitterness of the old society further heightened the community members' class consciousness. Everyone, with hearts full of excitement, expressed: Forever loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, thoroughly carry out the large-scale criticism, determined to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, resolutely walk the socialist road.

### 以毛泽东思想为武器  紧紧结合社员的活思想  人民大队狠批中国的赫鲁晓夫

    以毛泽东思想为武器  紧紧结合社员的活思想
    人民大队狠批中国的赫鲁晓夫
    据新华社贵阳二十二日电　贵州平坝县城关公社人民大队，以毛泽东思想为武器，狠抓活思想，发动广大社员开展大批判运动。通过大批判，他们深深感到，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，并不是和自己隔着万水千山，他们的毒牙早已伸到了自己的身边；大批判并不只是“识字人办的事”，而是咱拿锄头的农民和全国人民保卫毛主席无产阶级革命路线的生死斗争。
    这个大队的贫下中农和民兵，对党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，怀着刻骨的仇恨。他们把参加对这一小撮坏家伙的大批判，当作头等大事。但是，在大批判之初，也有的社员认为：党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，离贵州几千里，隔了千道水万层山，似乎自己批判不批判，关系不大。也有的社员说：我们文化、理论水平低，搞大批判是识字人办的事。还有一些人，知道党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派是个大坏蛋，但他放了哪些毒、干了哪些坏事，不大清楚，批起来不大具体。
    针对这些活思想和实际情况，这个大队首先大张旗鼓地在社员中揭发了中国的赫鲁晓夫反对毛泽东思想、反对无产阶级专政、破坏集体经济、复辟资本主义等方面的罪行；同时，组织社员学习有关的毛主席语录和《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》的有关社论，给他们批判的武器。这样，广大贫下中农眼里有了目标，手里有了战无不胜的毛泽东思想的武器，一场大批判大斗争就在全大队迅速地展开了。许多社员说，这些家伙狗胆不小，竟敢反对我们心中的红太阳毛主席，我们要坚决把他们打倒！不少贫下中农用自己的亲身体会激动地说：“过去给地主当牛马，让他们剥削得少吃无穿，恨死他们了。中国的赫鲁晓夫反而说什么‘农民欢迎剥削’，‘雇工不叫剥削’，真是把人气炸了！”“几千年的苦水，贫下中农吃够了。他们还想出一大堆鬼点子，‘保护富农经济’，推行‘三自一包’、‘四大自由’，想叫我们走回头路，吃二遍苦，我们决不答应！”
    农村生产很忙，居住分散，不能经常开大会批判。这个大队从实际出发，采取大会批判和小会批判相结合，开会批判与平时议论相结合的办法。每一次会批一个论点。
    毛主席教导我们说：“有比较才能鉴别。有鉴别，有斗争，才能发展。”人民大队在大批判运动中，遵循毛主席这一教导，抓住党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的罪行中与农村社员密切相关的几个方面，如：“三自一包”，“四大自由”和“阶级斗争熄灭论”，反对突出政治和反对活学活用毛主席著作等方面，运用
  “三对比”的方法，来进行深入的批判。“三对比”是：把毛主席怎么说的和中国的赫鲁晓夫怎么说的相对比；把中国的赫鲁晓夫放的毒和本地情况相对比；把社会主义的甜和旧社会的苦相对比。例如，毛主席教导我们：“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却不分敌友，主张“阶级合作”。社员们这么一对比，党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派反对毛泽东思想的罪恶面貌就暴露出来了。毛主席教导我们：“只有社会主义能够救中国。”中国的赫鲁晓夫却主张“三自一包”。这么一对比，中国的赫鲁晓夫梦想复辟资本主义的丑恶嘴脸又暴露无遗了。
    把毛主席怎么说的和中国的赫鲁晓夫怎么说的相对比，是从理论上批判的一个好方法。把中国的赫鲁晓夫放的毒和本地情况对比，又是增加社员们对中国的赫鲁晓夫这个坏家伙的感性认识的一个好方法。在批判“三自一包”时，和本地情况一对比，很多社员说：前几年，我们当地走资本主义道路当权派主张把土地分给社员。这些都是受了中国赫鲁晓夫的流毒。根子在他那里，他是全中国人民的害人精。他和我们远隔千山万水，可是他的毒牙已经伸到了我们身边。这就是两条道路的斗争。
    在大批判中组织贫下中农把今天社会主义的甜和旧社会的苦相对比，进一步提高了社员的阶级觉悟。大家怀着万分激动的心情表示：永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，彻底搞好大批判，决心把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，坚决走社会主义道路。
