The responsible official of the Consular Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China summoned the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, Hopson, on the afternoon of July 22. The official lodged the strongest protest against British sailors repeatedly insulting the most beloved and respected leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and engaging in serious political provocations in Chinese ports. The official handed over a memorandum to Hopson, the full text of which is as follows:

Memorandum

Since May 1967, British sailors on British merchant ships have repeatedly insulted the most beloved and respected leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, in the ports of Dalian, Shanghai, Huangpu, and Qinhuangdao, engaging in seven instances of political provocation:

1. The British ship "Lord Glaston" arrived in Dalian on May 2. During its stay in Dalian, the British sailors, Eckford and Twitchen, insulted Chairman Mao's portrait on May 7 and 15.

2. The British ship "East Moon" arrived in Shanghai from New Port on May 28. During its voyage to Shanghai and while in Shanghai, the British sailors, Chief Engineer F. J. G. and Second Engineer A. T., Chief Officer McDonald, Second Officer P. N., and Third Officer J. S. all maliciously insulted Chairman Mao's portrait, Chairman Mao badges, and Chairman Mao's quotations.

3. The British ship "Great Diamond" insulted Chairman Mao's quotations while docked in Huangpu on May 31. The captain, Pearson, publicly insulted Chairman Mao's quotations.

4. The British ship "Reliance" arrived in Dalian on June 8. The British sailor, Third Engineer H. L., repeatedly insulted Chairman Mao and Chairman Mao's quotations and, along with another sailor, M. P. L., assaulted two Chinese sailors, injuring them. On July 6, the ship posted two drawings insulting Chairman Mao.

5. The British ship "North Pole" arrived in the Pearl River estuary on June 26. The British chief officer, M. N., repeatedly insulted Chairman Mao.

6. On July 2, the British sailor, Assistant Engineer L. R., on the British ship "Laytonia" publicly insulted Chairman Mao and deliberately violated customs regulations by refusing to present his documents for inspection.

We must solemnly point out that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China lodged a strong protest with the British Chargé d'Affaires on May 19, 1967, regarding the incident of British sailors on the British ship "Lord Glaston" insulting Chairman Mao's portrait. The secretary of the British Chargé d'Affaires, B. T. G., assured us that such incidents would not happen again when he accepted the protest. However, it is outrageous that the British government has not taken effective measures. Instead, British sailors in Chinese ports have continued to engage in political provocations, which is a deliberate act of opposition to the People's Republic of China and is closely linked to the current fascist brutal suppression of Chinese residents by the British authorities in Hong Kong and the long-standing hostility of the British government towards the Chinese people. The British government bears an inescapable responsibility for these political provocations by British sailors.

British sailors who engage in political provocations deserve to be punished. However, on June 27, the British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, T. R., when meeting with the Acting Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in the UK, Shen Ping, provocatively questioned what law British sailors had broken and even made threats. We solemnly tell you that Chairman Mao is the most beloved and respected leader of the Chinese people. Insulting Chairman Mao is an insult to the socialist People's Republic of China and to the great seven hundred million Chinese people. It is the most serious political provocation and is absolutely intolerable. We once again lodge the strongest protest against the British government.

We also clearly tell you that the Chinese people are not afraid of any threats. If the British government wants to make an issue of this, it will not end well.

It is well known that we have always given good treatment and convenience to foreign merchant ships and sailors coming to Chinese ports. The majority of sailors from most countries are friendly and cooperative with us and abide by our management regulations. However, British sailors on British ships have repeatedly engaged in political provocations. The relevant authorities in China have the right to impose appropriate sanctions on these provocateurs. We solemnly warn you that the days when imperialism ran rampant in China are long gone. If the British government knows what is good for it, it must immediately take effective measures to stop such political provocations. Otherwise, the relevant authorities in China will impose severe punishments. Do not say you were not warned.

Beijing, July 22, 1967

    我外交部领事司负责人召见英国驻华代办
    最强烈抗议英船员在我港口进行政治挑衅
    新华社二十二日讯  中华人民共和国外交部领事司负责人于七月二十二日下午召见了英国驻华代办霍普森，就英国船员在我国港口一再侮辱中国人民最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，进行严重的政治挑衅，向英国政府提出了最强烈的抗议，并就这些政治挑衅事件交给他一份备忘录，全文如下：备忘录
    自一九六七年五月以来，英国商船上的英国船员在中国大连、上海、黄埔、秦皇岛等港口连续七次进行了侮辱中国人民最最敬爱的领袖毛主席的政治挑衅事件：
    一、英轮“劳德·格拉斯通”号五月二日到大连，在我大连港停泊期间，英籍船员爱克弗德和特威琴于五月七日和十五日两次侮辱毛主席像；
    二、英轮“东月”号五月二十八日自新港抵上海，在赴上海途中和在上海期间，英籍大车弗杰生、二车阿尔特、大副麦克唐纳、二副彼纳丁、三副庄斯对毛主席像、毛主席像章和毛主席语录均进行了恶毒的侮辱；
    三、英轮“大宝石”号五月三十一日在黄埔停泊时，船长皮尔逊公开辱骂毛主席语录；
    四、英轮“雷利”号六月八日抵大连港，英籍副三车海利地多次侮辱毛主席和毛主席语录，并与另一船员马浦列贝克殴打两名中国船员致伤；七月六日，该船又贴出两张侮辱毛主席的画；
    五、英轮“北冰洋”号六月二十六日抵珠江口，该轮英籍大副牟尼多次辱骂毛主席；
    六、七月二日，英轮“拉依坦西亚”号上的英籍轮机助理劳力斯公开辱骂毛主席，并且故意违反我港口边防检查的规定，拒绝交验证件；
    我们要严正指出，中华人民共和国外交部曾于一九六七年五月十九日就英轮“劳德·格拉斯通”号英籍船员侮辱毛主席像事件向英国代办处提出了强烈的抗议。英国代办处的秘书白通礼在接受抗议时也曾保证今后不会再发生类似事件。但令人愤慨的是，英国政府并未采取有效措施，相反的，近一时期以来，英国船员在中国港口却进一步连续地进行政治挑衅，是蓄意反对中华人民共和国，也是与目前香港英国当局对中国居民进行法西斯残暴镇压和英国政府一贯敌视中国人民分不开的。英国政府对上述英籍船员的一系列政治挑衅事件负有不可推卸的责任。
    英国船员进行政治挑衅，受到惩罚是罪有应得，但是英国外交部次官台·拉曼尔六月二十七日在约见中国驻英国代办处临时代办沈平时，竟然挑衅性地质问，英国船员犯了什么法，并且还进行威胁。我们严肃地告诉你们，毛主席是中国人民最最敬爱的领袖，侮辱毛主席就是对社会主义的中华人民共和国和伟大的七亿中国人民的侮辱，是最严重的政治挑衅，是绝对不能容忍的。在此，再一次向英国政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    我们也明白地告诉你们，中国人民是不怕任何威胁的。如果英国政府要借此作什么文章的话，是绝不会有什么好结果的。
    众所周知，我们对来中国港口的外国商船和船员一向给予良好的接待和方便，绝大多数国家的船上人员也是与我们友好合作，遵守我国的管理制度的，而英国船上的英籍人员却一而再，再而三地进行政治挑衅。中国有关当局对挑衅分子完全有权给予应有的制裁。我们要严正地警告你们，帝国主义在中国横行霸道的日子早就一去不复返了。英国政府如果识时务的话，必须立即采取有效措施，制止类似政治挑衅行为的发生，否则，中国有关当局将给予严厉的惩罚，勿谓言之不预也。			   一九六七年七月二十二日于北京
