The documentary film "Revolutionary Youth Most Listen to Chairman Mao's Words" is a victory song of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a victory song of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought. With its powerful and vivid scenes, it showcases the revolutionary scene of the revolutionary teachers and students in Shanghai's primary and secondary schools who resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, reporting their experiences in great criticism, great unity, and "resuming classes and making revolution." Their experiences can be summarized in one point: Remember Chairman Mao's teachings, use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and promote revolutionary great unity in the revolutionary great criticism.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Organize tens of millions of people, mobilize a vast revolutionary army, this is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolutionaries." Only by achieving revolutionary great unity can we maximize the isolation and strike against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and most thoroughly eliminate the various revisionist poisons they spread. However, some comrades say: "Revolution can be made without unity," "Fight, criticize, and reform can be achieved without unity." This is wrong and does not conform to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. If we do not overcome this wrong idea, we cannot mobilize all revolutionary factors, unite all those who can be united, and form a vast revolutionary army; if we do not overcome this wrong idea, we cannot maximize the isolation and strike against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. "Each to their own," each occupying a hill, not cooperating with each other, forces not concentrated, even mutually restraining, canceling out strength, how can the task of fighting, criticizing, and reforming be completed? How can we resume classes and make revolution without revolutionary great unity? The class enemy is most afraid of the great unity of the revolutionary masses, because the day the proletarian revolutionary masses unite is the day they are thoroughly finished. We have no reason not to unite to resume classes and make revolution. We must overcome the "self" and proceed from the overall interests of the revolution, eliminate the phenomenon of various revolutionary organizations occupying hills, root out "internal wars," and concentrate the spearhead of struggle on our common enemy—the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The revolutionary youth of Shanghai say well: Unite and fight the enemy together, that is a complete revolutionary.

The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In front of us, there are two types of social contradictions, namely, the contradiction between the enemy and us and the contradiction within the people. These are two types of contradictions with completely different natures." However, some comrades say: "The differences between our two factions are fundamental differences, great unity is impossible." Is that really the case? No. It is normal for revolutionary organizations and comrades to have differences and contradictions. Even if the differences between revolutionary organizations are great, they are still contradictions within the people, fundamentally different from our contradictions with the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Why can't we eliminate differences and quickly achieve revolutionary great unity? We believe that the reason for this wrong idea is still the "self" in the mind. Starting from the "self," it is easy to exaggerate contradictions within the people, even confuse two types of contradictions with different natures; starting from the "self," there is often a lack of urgency to unite, and even no intention to unite at all. We must overcome the "self," further arm our minds with Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling two types of different contradictions, so as to correctly recognize and handle the contradictions between revolutionary organizations, use the formula of "unity-criticism-unity" to solve each other's differences, and achieve new unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. We must not act on impulse, arbitrarily label, arbitrarily beat, and arbitrarily elevate, because doing so is not conducive to the resolution of contradictions and is not conducive to the achievement of revolutionary great unity.

Resuming classes and making revolution is an inevitable requirement for the deep development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Everyone knows that combining the mass movement to criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road with the fight, criticize, and reform of each unit is an important task of the current Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. To complete this glorious and arduous combat task, we must achieve revolutionary great unity. In schools, it is to resume classes and make revolution on the basis of great unity, to focus the attention of the broad revolutionary teachers and students on criticizing China's Khrushchev and the fight, criticize, and reform of their own units, to thoroughly eliminate the various revisionist poisons spread by China's Khrushchev on the cultural front, and to let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought fly high on the cultural front. Resuming classes and making revolution is a great call from Chairman Mao, and it is also an urgent demand of us broad revolutionary teachers and students.

We must listen to Chairman Mao's words, quickly achieve revolutionary great unity, and resume classes and make revolution with the spirit of "seizing the day"!

　　听毛主席的话　实现革命大联合

    纪录影片《革命小将最听毛主席话》，是无产阶级文化大革命的胜利颂歌，是光焰无际的毛泽东思想的胜利颂歌。它以气势磅礴、生动感人的镜头，展示了上海市中小学的革命师生坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的革命景象，报道了他们在大批判、大联合和“复课闹革命”中所取得的经验。他们的经验，集中到一点，就是：牢记毛主席的教导，以毛泽东思想为武器，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，在革命的大批判中推进革命的大联合。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”只有实现革命的大联合，才能最大限度地孤立和打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，才能最彻底地清除他们所散布的种种修正主义毒素。然而，有的同志却说：“不联合也能闹革命”，“不联合也能实现斗、批、改”。这是错误的，不符合马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的。如果不克服这种错误思想，就不能调动一切革命因素，团结一切可以团结的人，汇成一支浩浩荡荡的革命大军；如果不克服这种错误思想，就不能最大限度地孤立和打击党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。“你一摊，我一摊”，各占山头，彼此不协作，火力不集中，甚至互相牵制，抵消力量，这怎能完成斗、批、改的战斗任务呢？不实行革命的大联合又怎能进行复课闹革命呢？阶级敌人是最惧怕革命派的大联合的，因为无产阶级革命派大联合之日，就是他们彻底完蛋之时。我们没有任何理由不联合起来复课闹革命。我们必须打倒“私”字，从革命的整体利益出发，消除革命组织之间各占山头的现象，根绝“内战”，把斗争矛头集中指向我们的共同敌人——党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。上海革命小将说得好：联合起来，共同对敌，才是完全的革命派。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“在我们的面前有两类社会矛盾，这就是敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾。这是性质完全不同的两类矛盾。”然而，有的同志却说：“我们两派之间的分歧，是根本性的分歧，大联合不可能。”事情果真如此么？否。革命组织、革命同志之间有分歧、有矛盾，这是正常的现象。革命组织之间，即使分歧再大，也还是人民内部矛盾，根本不同于我们同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的矛盾，为什么就不能消除分歧，迅速实现革命的大联合呢？我们认为所以会有这种错误想法，仍然是头脑中的“私”字在作祟。从“私”字出发，就容易夸大人民内部矛盾，甚至混淆两类性质不同的矛盾；从“私”字出发，往往缺乏联合的迫切愿望，甚至根本不打算联合。必须打倒“私”字，进一步用毛主席关于正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾的学说，武装我们的头脑，才能正确认识和处理革命组织之间的矛盾，用“团结——批评——团结”的公式，去解决彼此的分歧，在毛泽东思想的基础上达到新的团结。切切不可意气用事，乱扣帽子，乱打棍子，随意上纲，因为这样做不利于矛盾的解决，也不利于实现革命的大联合。
    复课闹革命，是无产阶级文化大革命深入发展的必然要求。大家知道，把批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的群众运动，同各单位的斗、批、改结合起来，这是当前无产阶级文化大革命的重要任务。而要完成这一光荣而艰巨的战斗任务，就必须实现革命的大联合，在学校，就是要在大联合的基础上进行复课闹革命，把广大革命师生的注意力，集中在批判中国的赫鲁晓夫和本单位的斗、批、改上面，彻底肃清中国的赫鲁晓夫在文教战线上所散布的各种修正主义流毒，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗在文教战线上高高飘扬。复课闹革命是毛主席发出的伟大号召，也是我们广大革命师生的迫切要求。
    我们一定要听毛主席的话，迅速实现革命的大联合，以“只争朝夕”的精神进行复课闹革命！
