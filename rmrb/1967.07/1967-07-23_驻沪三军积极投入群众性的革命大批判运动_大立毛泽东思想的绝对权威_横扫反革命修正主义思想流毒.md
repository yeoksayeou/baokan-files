A new wave of revolutionary criticism, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, is sweeping through the PLA units stationed in Shanghai. The soldiers and officers are following the great leader Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, organizing a massive revolutionary criticism force to politically, ideologically, and theoretically annihilate the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They are determined to thoroughly expose, criticize, and denounce them, making them infamous forever and ensuring they never rise again!

During the "January Revolution" storm, where the Shanghai proletarian revolutionaries seized power from the handful of power-holders within the Party who were taking the capitalist road in the Shanghai region, the PLA stationed in Shanghai played an immortal role. In this ongoing struggle to seize power politically and ideologically from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the soldiers and officers are once again at the forefront, leading the charge. The broad masses of soldiers and officers stationed in Shanghai, who are guarding the socialist motherland and the various fronts of the Cultural Revolution, and who are fighting on the frontlines of "three supports, two militaries," regard this revolutionary criticism as a great historical task of strategic significance in defending the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is a decisive battle between two classes, two roads, and two lines. It is the key to achieving a complete victory in the Cultural Revolution. They say with fighting spirit, "Our great commander-in-chief Chairman Mao teaches us that the only way to deal with imperialists and Chinese reactionaries is to organize forces to struggle against them... and defeat them." The PLA is the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must not only firmly hold the gun, vigilantly guard the national defense, and be ready to annihilate any invading enemy at any time. We must also firmly hold the pen, sweep away the poison spread by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in various fields, sweep away all exploitative class ideologies, and firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

In recent days, from air force bases and naval docks to various camps, in factories, rural areas, stations, ports, and schools, the broad masses of soldiers and officers, with high political enthusiasm and fighting spirit, and with deep hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, have joined the revolutionary masses of Shanghai in demonstrations, exposing and criticizing meetings. They are determined to turn the former "giant" Chinese Khrushchev into ashes in this massive encirclement and annihilation.

A prominent feature of the revolutionary criticism movement in the Shanghai garrison is that it firmly grasps the direction of the struggle, consistently aiming at the Chinese Khrushchev, verbally and in writing, fiercely attacking and annihilating, waging an unprecedented "people's war." They expose the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev, strip off his disguise. They use the invincible truth of Mao Zedong Thought, the great call of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, and the advanced thoughts and deeds of heroes nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought to compare, analyze, and criticize the counter-revolutionary words and deeds of the Chinese Khrushchev. They also compare the fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev with the counter-revolutionary words and deeds of the notorious old opportunists Trotsky, Bukharin, and Khrushchev in history. As Chairman Mao teaches, "Comparison is the key to discernment." Through this comparison, everyone can see more clearly that the Chinese Khrushchev is not a "veteran revolutionary" at all, but a thorough counter-revolutionary, completely identical to various opportunists who have already been thrown into the historical garbage dump.

Many units of the Shanghai Garrison and the East China Sea Fleet have compiled and published the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev, making it clear to everyone that this Chinese Khrushchev, before the nation's victory, opposed armed seizure of power. After the nation's victory, he advocated that capitalists "deserve to exploit," opposed the socialist road, betrayed the dictatorship of the proletariat, and in the political, economic, and cultural fields, he promoted capitalist restoration. At the same time, internationally, he pursued a revisionist line of "three surrenders and one extinction"—surrendering to imperialism, surrendering to modern revisionism, surrendering to reactionaries of all countries, and extinguishing the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed peoples. After these crimes were published in the units, the broad masses of soldiers and officers were furious. They organized "sharp spearhead teams" and "demolition squads," carrying the enemy situation, studying Chairman Mao's works actively, selecting weapons for counterattack from the treasure house of Mao Zedong Thought, and conducting in-depth exposure and thorough criticism of the crimes of the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, pushing the criticism movement forward vigorously!

The broad masses of soldiers and officers fighting on the frontlines of "three supports, two militaries" have joined the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary cadres and masses in the new wave of criticism. They fight shoulder to shoulder, further strengthening military-civilian unity, forming an iron fist that can smash anything in the criticism. The broad masses of soldiers and officers executing "three supports, two militaries" tasks in factories, schools, stations, and docks, together with the proletarian revolutionaries, expose, criticize, and investigate the poison spread by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in their units, tracing the vines to the roots, closely linking the criticism movement with the struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units, making the revolutionary criticism movement deeper and deeper.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon for revolutionary criticism. The broad masses of soldiers and officers in the Shanghai garrison regard the process of criticism as the best classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively. Many units' soldiers and officers, with the question of whether the enemy is already a "dead tiger," study and apply Chairman Mao's teachings on the unchanging nature of imperialism and all reactionaries, further brightening their eyes and enhancing their class struggle consciousness.

    驻沪三军积极投入群众性的革命大批判运动
    大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威
    横扫反革命修正主义思想流毒
    据新华社上海二十二日电　一场以毛泽东思想为武器，穷追猛打“落水狗”的群众性革命大批判新高潮，正在人民解放军驻沪陆海空三军各部队轰轰烈烈地蓬勃展开。广大指战员紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的伟大战略部署，组织起浩浩荡荡的革命大批判大军，从政治上、思想上、理论上围歼党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，决心把他们彻底揭深、批透、斗臭，叫他们遗臭万年，永世不得翻身！
    在上海无产阶级革命派向上海地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争的“一月革命”风暴中，驻沪三军立下了不朽功勋。在这场从政治上、思想上向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派继续夺权的大批判运动中，广大指战员又是冲在前面，打在头里。坚守在保卫社会主义祖国、保卫无产阶级文化大革命各个岗位上和战斗在“三支”、“两军”第一线的驻沪三军广大指战员，把这场革命的大批判，看作是保卫无产阶级专政的具有战略意义的伟大历史任务，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线生死搏斗的决战，是夺取无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的关键。他们充满战斗激情地说，我们的伟大统帅毛主席教导我们，对待帝国主义者和中国反动派，“唯一的办法是组织力量和他们斗争，……把他们打倒”。人民解放军是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石。我们不仅要紧握枪杆子，警惕地守卫国防，随时准备痛歼胆敢来犯之敌，我们还要紧握笔杆子，横扫党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在各个领域里散布的流毒，横扫一切剥削阶级思想，大树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。连日来，从空军机场、海军码头到各个营区，在工厂、农村、车站、港口、学校，广大指战员以饱满的政治热情，高昂的战斗精神，满怀对中国的赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，和上海地区的革命派一起示威游行，举行揭发、批判大会，决心把中国的赫鲁晓夫这个昔日的“庞然大物”，在这次群众性的大围剿中，烧得焦头烂额，化为灰烬。
    驻沪部队的革命大批判运动，一个显著的特点，是牢牢把握斗争大方向，自始至终对准中国的赫鲁晓夫，口诛笔伐，猛打猛杀，打一场规模空前的“人民战争”。他们大摆中国的赫鲁晓夫的罪状，大剥中国的赫鲁晓夫的画皮。他们用战无不胜的毛泽东思想的光辉真理，林彪副主席的伟大号召，在毛泽东思想哺育下成长起来的英雄人物的先进思想和先进事迹，去对照、分析、批判中国的赫鲁晓夫的反革命言行，并且将中国的赫鲁晓夫的谬论，与历史上臭名昭著的老机会主义者托洛茨基、布哈林以及赫鲁晓夫等的反革命言行进行对比。正如毛主席教导的，“有比较才能鉴别”，这样一对比，使大家更加清楚地看到，中国的赫鲁晓夫，根本不是什么“老革命”，而是地地道道的“老反革命”，与那些已经进了历史垃圾堆的形形色色的机会主义者完全是一丘之貉。上海警备区和海军东海舰队许多部队的指战员，把中国的赫鲁晓夫的罪状，整理归纳，公布于众，使大家清楚地看到，这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，在全国胜利前，反对武装夺取政权，在全国胜利后，鼓吹资本家“剥削有功”，反对走社会主义道路，背叛无产阶级专政，在政治、经济、文化等各个领域里大搞资本主义复辟，同时在国际上推行投降帝国主义、投降现代修正主义、投降各国反动派，扑灭被压迫人民的革命斗争烈火的“三降一灭”的修正主义路线。这些罪状在部队公布以后，广大指战员个个怒不可遏。他们纷纷组织“尖刀班”、
  “爆破组”，带着敌情，活学活用毛主席著作，在毛泽东思想的宝库里选择针锋相对的杀敌武器，针对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的罪行，一个一个地进行深刻揭露，彻底批判，把大批判运动汹涌蓬勃地推向前进！
    战斗在“三支”、“两军”第一线的驻沪部队广大指战员，与无产阶级革命派和广大革命干部、革命群众，一起投入大批判的新高潮。他们同仇敌忾，并肩战斗，在大批判中进一步加强了军民团结，形成了痛打“落水狗”的无坚不摧的铁拳头。在工厂、学校、车站、码头执行“三支”、“两军”任务的广大指战员，与无产阶级革命派一起，大揭发，大批判，大查党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在本单位的流毒，顺瓜摸藤，顺藤挖根，把大批判运动与本单位斗批改紧密结合起来，使革命的大批判运动一步比一步深入。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是革命大批判最锐利的武器，驻沪三军广大指战员把大批判的过程，当作活学活用毛主席著作的最好课堂。许多部队指战员带着“敌人是否已经是死老虎”的问题，活学活用毛主席关于帝国主义和一切反动派的本性是不会改变的教导，进一步擦亮了眼睛，增强了阶级斗争观念。
