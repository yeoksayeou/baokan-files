The People's Liberation Army stationed in Tibet has sown wheat in the Chayu Valley, the Nyang River banks, and the banks of the Yarlung Zangbo River, where the land has been dormant for a thousand years. The golden waves of wheat are rolling, presenting a scene of bumper harvest. Currently, the soldiers are enthusiastically wielding their sickles to reap the wheat. They are harvesting, threshing, and storing the wheat simultaneously. From the initial harvesting and threshing, it can be seen that the yield per acre of these wheat fields has set a new record for wheat yield per acre in the Tibetan Plateau.

A year ago, most of these wheat fields were either barren hills or wild grass and shrubs. Under the brilliant guidance of Chairman Mao's great directive that "the People's Liberation Army should be a great school," the broad masses of soldiers and officers in the Tibet garrison decided to march into these barren mountains and valleys, to make these barren mountains and valleys contribute grain. They studied and applied the "Three Constantly Read Articles" extensively, carried out thorough ideological reform, and with the revolutionary spirit of "moving mountains like Yu Gong," they hacked their way through thickets, filled valleys, turned sand dunes into fertile fields. They finally awakened the land that had been dormant for a thousand years, sowing the seeds of happiness. They overcame the threats of drought and pests, ensuring a bumper wheat harvest.

In the days of harvesting wheat, the soldiers said: This summer's bumper harvest is the result of holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and insisting on putting politics in command. It is another fruitful achievement of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

    既是战斗队又是工作队生产队
    驻藏部队大战荒山获小麦丰收
    据新华社拉萨十七日电　人民解放军驻藏部队在西藏高原的察隅河谷、尼洋河两岸和雅鲁藏布江畔千年沉睡的土地上播种的小麦，金浪滚滚，呈现出一片大丰收景象。目前，指战员们正在意气风发地挥镰割麦。他们边收、边打、边藏，从初步收打的情况看，这些麦田的亩产量，揭开了西藏高原小麦亩产量的新的一页。
    一年前，这些麦田大部分还是荒坡秃岭或者是野草杂木丛生的荒野。在伟大统帅毛主席关于“人民解放军应该是一个大学校”的伟大指示的光辉照耀下，驻藏部队广大指战员决心向这些荒山、河谷进军，要这些荒山、河谷献粮。他们大学大用“老三篇”，大搞思想革命化，以“愚公移山”的革命精神，披荆斩棘，辟山填壑，翻沙丘，变良田。终于唤醒了千年沉睡的土地，播上了幸福的种籽。战胜了干旱和虫害的威胁，保证了小麦丰收。
    在喜收小麦的日子里，指战员们说：今年夏季丰收，是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、坚持突出政治的结果，是无产阶级文化大革命又一丰硕果实。
