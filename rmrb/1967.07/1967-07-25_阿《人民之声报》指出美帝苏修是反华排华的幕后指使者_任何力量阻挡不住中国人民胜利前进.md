The Albanian "People's Voice" published an editorial on July 22 exposing and condemning the recent anti-China wave instigated by imperialism, revisionism, and reactionary forces in various countries.

The article cites numerous facts to expose the anti-China and anti-Chinese crimes committed by the reactionary forces in India, Indonesia, Burma, Japan, and Nepal, as well as by British imperialism in Hong Kong. The article states that these reactionary forces ruthlessly suppress the broad masses of urban and rural workers in their own countries and persecute and massacre progressive and revolutionary individuals. The laboring masses in India, Indonesia, Burma, and other countries are being cruelly oppressed and exploited to the point of intolerability, and they are increasingly rising up in political, economic, and armed struggles against their ruling classes to end their rule. The great achievements China has made in all fields are a tremendous inspiration to all laborers in these countries in their struggles against oppression and for freedom and democracy. This infuriates the domestic and foreign reactionaries in China.

The article states that reactionary, feudal, bourgeois, and fascist rulers, in order to extricate themselves from their domestic predicaments, attempt to find a way out through anti-China sentiments, divert attention, deceive their own laboring masses, and shift their focus from domestic woes to external issues; at the same time, they ensure that they receive as much support and assistance as possible from the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists.

The article points out that currently, the reactionary forces in various countries, under the support and direction of imperialism and revisionism, are particularly active in opposing China. This is because, under the leadership of the glorious Communist Party of China headed by Comrade Mao Zedong, the People's Republic of China has become a strong bastion for all the oppressed people in the world and an insurmountable obstacle for imperialism, revisionism, and reactionary forces in various countries. China is advancing victoriously from one victory to another. The victorious development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Comrade Mao Zedong proves this.

The article states that today, China is loved and sympathized with by all oppressed revolutionary peoples, while imperialists, modern revisionists, and reactionary forces in various countries hate it to the core. This is the reason for their anti-China movements on an international scale and in some countries.

The article points out that now, the days of the imperialists led by the United States and the modern revisionists led by Khrushchev are not good. They are failing everywhere. Faced with this situation, these enemies of humanity attempt to patch up their tattered masks and plot new conspiracies against the peoples of various countries.

The article states that thus, the true organizers and masterminds behind the anti-China and anti-Chinese movements in some Asian countries and other regions have been exposed. They are the U.S. imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists.

The article concludes by saying that the Albanian people resolutely condemn these savage anti-China and anti-Chinese actions and strongly condemn the reactionary forces in India, Indonesia, Burma, Japan, and Nepal, the British authorities in Hong Kong, the Chiang Kai-shek clique, the Park Chung-hee clique in South Korea, and the U.S. imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists behind them. The Albanian people believe that the anti-China movement cannot in the slightest weaken the truthful luster of China's principled policies, stop the victorious advance of the Chinese people, or hinder the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the love of revolutionary peoples around the world for Comrade Mao Zedong and China. The anti-China movement will not save imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionary forces in various countries from their ultimate failure, nor will it ever hinder the victory of the world revolution. The Albanian people are further strengthening the eternal friendship forged by the Albanian Party of Labor and the Communist Party of China with the fraternal Chinese people, standing together, fighting together, and winning together.

    阿《人民之声报》指出美帝苏修是反华排华的幕后指使者
    任何力量阻挡不住中国人民胜利前进
    据新华社地拉那二十二日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》二十二日发表编辑部文章，揭露和谴责帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派最近掀起的反华逆流。
    文章列举大量事实揭露印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸、日本以及尼泊尔等国的反动派和英帝国主义在香港进行的一系列反华、排华罪行。文章说，这些反动派在国内都是无情地镇压本国的城乡广大劳动人民群众，迫害和屠杀进步和革命人士。印度、印尼、缅甸等国的劳动群众被残酷的压迫剥削弄得忍无可忍，正在越来越广泛地掀起政治、经济和武装斗争，反对本国统治阶级，争取结束它们的统治。中国在各方面取得的伟大成就是对这些国家的所有劳动者进行反对压迫、争取自由和民主斗争的巨大鼓舞。这使中国国内外的反动派暴跳如雷。
    文章说，反动、封建、资产阶级和法西斯统治者为了把自己从国内困境中解脱出来，企图通过反华寻找出路，转移视线，欺骗本国的劳动群众，把他们的注意力从国内的忧患转向国外；同时，确保自己尽可能多地得到美帝和苏修的支持和帮助。
    文章指出，当前各国反动派在帝国主义和修正主义的支持和指使下特别起劲地反对中国，这是因为在以毛泽东同志为首的光荣的中国共产党领导下的中华人民共和国，已经成为世界上所有被压迫者的强大堡垒，成为帝国主义、修正主义、各国反动派不可逾越的巨大障碍。中国正在胜利地向前迈进，从一个胜利走向另一个胜利。由毛泽东同志领导的无产阶级文化大革命的胜利发展证明了这一点。
    文章说，今天，中国得到所有被压迫的革命人民的热爱和同情，而帝国主义者、现代修正主义者和各国反动派则对它恨之入骨，这就是他们在国际范围内和一些国家里掀起反华运动的原因所在。
    文章指出，现在以美国为首的帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫现代修正主义者的日子很不好过。他们到处遭到失败。面对这种形势，这些人类的死敌企图修补被撕得破烂不堪的假面具，策划反对各国人民的新阴谋。
    文章说，这样，在亚洲一些国家和其它地区发生的反华排华运动的真正组织者和指使者就昭然若揭了。他们就是美帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义者。
    文章最后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民坚决谴责这些反华排华的野蛮行动，愤怒谴责印度、印尼、缅甸、日本以及尼泊尔反动派，香港英国当局、蒋介石集团和南朝鲜朴正熙集团以及站在它们背后的美帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义者。阿尔巴尼亚人民相信，反华运动丝毫不能减弱中国的原则性政策的真理的光辉，阻挡不住中国人民的胜利前进，阻挡不住中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利和全世界革命人民对毛泽东同志和中国的热爱。反华运动也救不了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的最后失败，永远也阻挡不住世界革命的胜利。阿尔巴尼亚人民正在进一步加强由阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和中国共产党缔造的同兄弟中国人民的永恒的友好联系，紧密地团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
