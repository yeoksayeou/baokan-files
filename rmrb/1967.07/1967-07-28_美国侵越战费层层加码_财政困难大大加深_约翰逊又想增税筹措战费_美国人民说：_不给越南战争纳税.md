The U.S. imperialist war in Vietnam is continuously "escalating," with war expenditures rising again and again, deeply exacerbating the United States' fiscal difficulties.

U.S. Treasury Secretary Fowler recently admitted in a speech that the Vietnam War is "a very expensive war." Even according to the deliberately downsized figures from the U.S. government, direct expenditures on the Vietnam War in the past year amounted to at least $25 billion. According to materials published by the U.S. black organization "Congress of Racial Equality," current Vietnam War expenditures reach $30 billion a year, meaning "an average of $2.5 billion per month, $83 million per day, and $3 million per hour."

The direct consequence of the significant increase in Vietnam War expenditures is the appearance of a massive budget deficit. According to the U.S. government's downsized estimates, the budget deficit for the fiscal year 1967 may be around $11 billion, while the deficit for the fiscal year 1968, which began on July 1, may even exceed $24 billion.

To cover such a massive deficit, the Johnson administration is facing numerous difficulties.

Tax increases are one of the main fundraising methods used by the U.S. ruling class. However, they are encountering increasing difficulties in this regard. It is reported that during the fiscal year 1967, the average tax burden per person in the United States has reached $1,015. The broad masses of laboring people are increasingly resentful of the heavy taxes. Some Americans have already raised the battle cry of "No Taxes for the Vietnam War!" and have taken actions to resist taxation.

Another measure taken by the Johnson administration is to borrow large amounts from monopoly banks. The total national debt borrowed by the U.S. federal government reached $328 billion by mid-May, to the extent that the Treasury Department had to request Congress to raise the national debt limit again just two and a half months after Congress had previously approved an increase.

Further reducing non-military expenditures is another way for the U.S. ruling class to raise war funds. However, the Johnson administration is very concerned about the serious consequences that may arise from further cuts to such expenditures.

The remaining option is to print more money and further increase the currency supply. However, the Johnson administration cannot ignore the serious implications of this action. Domestically, the price increases caused by inflation have already made the people's grievances widespread. The frequent strikes that have occurred this year are a serious warning to Johnson.

When the fiscal year 1968 just began, the U.S. ruling class looked ahead with anxiety, finding no way out of the predicament.

    美国侵越战费层层加码　财政困难大大加深
    约翰逊又想增税筹措战费　美国人民说：“不给越南战争纳税”
    据新华社讯　华盛顿消息：美帝国主义侵越战争不断“升级”，侵越战费一增再增，大大加深了美国的财政困境。
    美国财政部长福勒不久前在一次讲话中无可奈何地承认，侵越战争是“一场很花钱的战争”。即使按照美国官方有意缩小了的数字，在过去一年中，侵越战争的直接开支也至少在二百五十亿美元左右。而据美国黑人组织“种族平等大会”公布的材料揭露，目前侵越战费一年达三百亿美元，也就是说，“每月平均二十五亿美元，每天平均八千三百万美元，每小时三百万美元”。
    侵越军费大幅度增加的直接后果是财政预算出现惊人庞大的赤字。据美国官方缩小了的估计，一九六七财政年度的预算赤字可能在一百一十亿美元左右，而七月一日刚刚开始的一九六八年度的赤字甚至可能超出二百四十亿美元。
    为了弥补这样庞大的亏空，约翰逊政府陷入重重的困难之中。
    增税是美国统治集团惯用的主要筹款途径之一。但是它在这方面遇到了越来越大的困难。据透露，一九六七财政年度内美国人民按人口平均的纳税负担已经达到一千零十五美元。广大劳动人民对于苛捐杂税的愤懑正在不断增加。一些美国人士已经提出了“不给越南战争纳税！”的战斗口号，并采取了抗税的行动。
    约翰逊政府采取的另一措施是向垄断银行大量“借债”。美国联邦政府所借国债总和在五月中旬达到了三千二百八十亿美元的巨大数字，以致财政部在美国国会上次批准提高国债限额之后不过两个半月，不得不再度要求国会提高国债限额。
    进一步削减非军事性开支，也是美国统治集团筹措战费的一个途径。但是，约翰逊政府很担心进一步砍削这类开支可能引起的严重后果。
    剩下的一条路就只有开动印钞机，进一步增发通货。但是约翰逊政府不能不考虑到这样做的严重影响。在国内，通货膨胀所引起的物价不断上涨，已经使人民怨声载道。今年以来此伏彼起的罢工斗争就是给约翰逊发出的严重警告。
    当一九六八财政年度刚刚开始的时候，美国统治集团瞻望前景，惶惶不安，找不出任何摆脱困境的办法来。
