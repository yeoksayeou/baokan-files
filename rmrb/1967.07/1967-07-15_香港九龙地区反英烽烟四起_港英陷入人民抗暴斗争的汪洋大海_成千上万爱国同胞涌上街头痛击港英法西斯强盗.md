From the evening of the 12th to the early morning of the 13th, flames of anti-British resistance spread across Hong Kong and Kowloon. Tens of thousands of patriotic compatriots took to the streets, defying the British-imposed curfew and fully armed British troops and "riot control teams." They were spirited and full of fighting spirit, using various means to strike back at the British fascist thugs.

On the 11th and 12th, the British fascist thugs used the curfew as cover to brazenly attack and set fire to the Hua Feng National Goods Company. They dispatched large numbers of British troops and armed police to attack the Motorcycle Industry Workers' Union and its Hong Kong Public Bus Division. In two days, they arrested more than a hundred compatriots. The British crimes of unprecedented magnitude ignited the righteous anger of our patriotic compatriots. From the east of Kowloon in Wong Tai Sin, Tung Tau Tsuen, and San Po Kong to the west in Mong Kok, Sham Shui Po, and Shek Kip Mei, and in Hong Kong's Sai Wan Ho, Wan Chai, and North Point, anti-British resistance actions erupted everywhere. The slogans "Long Live Chairman Mao," "Patriotism is not a crime, resisting violence is justified," and "Down with British imperialism" echoed through the streets. Under the brave struggle of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, the British police were running around in circles, and the British authorities were restless.

In the morning of the 13th, at around 11:00, the Wong Tai Sin police station was bombed. The British police officers inside were terrified, and they hurriedly set up defenses around the station. According to the British authorities, four cars and one motorcycle were destroyed in the bombing.

On the evening of the 12th, during the British-imposed curfew, patriotic compatriots threw three firecrackers at a police car parked near the Sai Wan Ho market. The British "riot control team" turned pale with fear. Then, people on the streets and in buildings threw glass bottles at them. At the same time, patriotic compatriots quickly smashed the glass windows and a wooden British "crown" sign of the HSBC Sai Wan Ho branch in the dark.

In the Wan Chai and North Point areas, from the start of the curfew until late at night on the 12th, patriotic compatriots were engaged in anti-British resistance. People burned piles of debris in the middle of the roads and threw firecrackers at the "riot control team," causing them to panic.

On the road between San Po Kong and Tung Tau Tsuen, the enemy was engulfed in the vast sea of people's war. People burned wooden boards from the bus stop and other materials. When the "riot control team" arrived, the crowd threw stones and glass bottles at them while shouting slogans. The crowd grew larger, and the "riot control team" fired more than ten tear gas canisters. The crowd then threw lit firecrackers and rockets from all directions at the police cars. As the "riot control team" fled, the crowd shouted, "Don't run, British executioners! We have a score to settle with you!"

The people of Sham Shui Po and Shek Kip Mei also took action. On the 12th, large character posters appeared in various buildings in Shek Kip Mei. In Sham Shui Po, patriotic compatriots burned a double-decker bus and smashed a single-decker bus. The Sham Shui Po post office was also set on fire.

At night, the brave patriotic film workers' light cavalry performed anti-British resistance acts on the bustling Nathan Road in Mong Kok. The battle drums inspired the patriotic compatriots. Patriotic compatriots also wrote large character slogans on nearby roads: "Patriotism is not a crime, resisting violence is justified!" As the performance was about to end, a large number of anti-resistance leaflets were scattered from the buildings above. When the British "riot control team" came to provoke, the crowd responded with jeers and shouted, "Down with British imperialism!"

    香港九龙地区反英烽烟四起
    港英陷入人民抗暴斗争的汪洋大海
    成千上万爱国同胞涌上街头痛击港英法西斯强盗
    新华社香港十四日电  从十二日晚上到十三日凌晨，香港、九龙地区反英抗暴烽烟四起，成千上万的爱国同胞涌上街头，他们蔑视港英的“宵禁令”，蔑视全副武装的英军和
  “防暴队”，意气风发，斗志昂扬，用各种办法痛击港英法西斯暴徒。
    十一日、十二日连续两天，港英法西斯强盗利用“宵禁令”作掩护，悍然袭击和火烧华丰国货公司，出动大批英军和武装警察袭击摩托车业职工总会和这个工会的香港公共汽车分会，在两天内共逮捕同胞一百余人。港英犯下的滔天罪行，激起我爱国同胞的冲天怒火，九龙东起黄大仙、东头村、新蒲岗，西至旺角、深水埗、石峡尾，香港的筲箕湾、湾仔和北角等地区，到处都出现反英抗暴行动，到处是“毛主席万岁”、“爱国无罪，抗暴有理”、“打倒英帝”的口号声。在香港爱国同胞的英勇斗争下，港英警察疲于奔命，港英当局坐卧不安。
    十三日上午十一时多，黄大仙警署挨炸，里面的英国警官和港英警察吓得鸡飞狗走，慌忙在警署四周布防。据港英当局宣布，这个警署有四部汽车和一辆摩托车被炸毁。
    十二日晚上，在港英实施“宵禁令”的时间内，爱国同胞向停在筲箕湾街市附近的警车投掷三个渔炮，吓得港英“防暴队”面如土色。接着，街上和屋宇上的群众纷纷向他们投掷玻璃瓶。与此同时，爱国同胞在漆黑中以迅速的动作，把英资渣打银行筲箕湾分行的玻璃窗和一个胶木制的英国“皇冠”标志砸成稀烂。
    在湾仔和北角区，十二日从“宵禁令”实施后直到深夜，都有爱国同胞进行反英抗暴斗争。人们把杂物堆在马路中心燃烧，向“防暴队”投掷大炮竹，吓得“防暴队”惊慌失措。
    在新蒲岗和东头村之间的马路上，敌人陷于人民战争的汪洋大海之中。人们把公共汽车站的木板等物堆起燃烧，“防暴队”来了，群众就一面以石块、玻璃瓶迎击，一面高呼口号。群众越聚越多，“防暴队”连发十多发催泪弹，群众就把燃着的炮竹、火箭从四面八方掷向警车。“防暴队”溜走时，群众高呼：“英帝刽子手不要走，我们要跟你算账！”
    深水埗和石峡尾的群众也行动起来。石峡尾各个大厦，十二日都出现抗暴大字报。在深水埗，爱国同胞焚烧了一辆双层公共汽车，打烂了一辆单层公共汽车。深水埗邮局也曾着火燃烧。
    夜晚，英勇的爱国电影工作者轻骑队在最热闹的旺角弥敦道街头演出反英抗暴节目，战斗锣鼓使爱国同胞大受鼓舞。爱国同胞还在附近马路上写大字标语：“爱国无罪，抗暴有理！”演出临近结束时，大批抗暴传单从楼上撒下。港英“防暴队”前来挑衅时，群众纷纷报以轻蔑的嘘声，并高呼“打倒英帝国主义！”
