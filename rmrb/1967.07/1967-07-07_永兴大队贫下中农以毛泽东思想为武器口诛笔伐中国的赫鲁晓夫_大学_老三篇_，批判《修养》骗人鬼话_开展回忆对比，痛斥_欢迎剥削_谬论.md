The poor and lower-middle peasants of Yongxing Brigade in Bayan County, Heilongjiang Province, following Chairman Mao's instructions to "rural people should focus on farming... but also need to criticize the bourgeoisie" and "you should pay attention to national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end," have raised the banner of revolutionary criticism. With the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, they use methods such as big debates, big-character posters, and big discussions to verbally and in writing condemn the heinous crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Chairman Mao said: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses; it can only be waged by mobilizing the masses and can only be waged by relying on the masses." The proletarian revolutionaries of this brigade, following Chairman Mao's instructions, first carried out ideological mobilization work. They organized the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to repeatedly study Chairman Mao's quotations on class struggle and relevant articles published in newspapers. Through study, everyone unanimously recognized that the struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is a major struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, a major struggle between Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought and revisionist ideology, and a major struggle of the proletariat against the restoration of capitalism. Old poor peasant Wang Yi angrily said: "This time I finally understand that the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road wants us to take the capitalist road, making us poor and lower-middle peasants suffer twice. We will never agree to this a thousand times." With heightened awareness, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres utilized their rest time to hold criticism meetings, write big-character posters, verbally and in writing condemn, and launch fierce attacks on the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road. The walls inside and outside the production teams were covered with big-character posters and big slogans denouncing China's Khrushchev. They also printed China's Khrushchev's crimes into leaflets and distributed them to every household, making them known to everyone, arousing the great indignation of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants. The brigade and production teams held more than thirty criticism meetings, with 375 revolutionary masses and cadres speaking, sparking a mass criticism movement.

In the course of the big criticism, they carried out new and old society comparisons and bitterness-remembrance-sweetness activities to arouse proletarian feelings and strengthen proletarian dictatorship. A total of 195 people, in small and large team meetings, recalled their family history, village history, and cooperativization history, using their personal experiences to criticize the reactionary fallacies advocated by the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, such as "employing labor is not exploitation, it increases social wealth" and "the working people do not oppose exploitation, but welcome it." Through the comparison of new and old societies and the three histories education, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants hated China's Khrushchev even more and loved the great leader Chairman Mao even more. At the bitterness meeting, the old poor peasant Nie Lianyou from the fourth team angrily denounced: "China's Khrushchev said that the working people do not oppose exploitation but welcome it. I was so angry I almost burst. In the evil old society, my family of four, with two laborers, could not even feed ourselves. We rolled in the landlord's fields all year round, still eating chaff and wearing rags." When he mentioned his father being forced to work as a laborer and being burned alive by the Japanese devils on the construction site, the entire audience of revolutionaries was furious, shouting: "Never forget class bitterness, forever remember blood debts, defend proletarian dictatorship to the death!" The head of the second production team, Li Shuchun, had a grudge because the poor and lower-middle peasants had posted a few big-character posters on him, and he was not enthusiastic about work. After recalling bitterness and criticizing the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, he used the "Old Three Articles" as a measure, thoroughly criticized the "self" and established the "public," solving his ideological problems. Now he actively organizes the members to study Chairman Mao's works, vigorously promotes revolution, and vigorously promotes production, and the team's production has shown a new situation.

The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of this brigade, in criticizing the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, took the "Old Three Articles" as their motto, using methods of exposing thoughts, discussing understandings, finding roots, and identifying harms. They used local vivid facts to severely criticize the representative work of the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, "Cultivation." Some erring cadres painfully denounced that they had been poisoned by "Cultivation," forgotten class struggle, and detached from the poor and lower-middle peasants. Brigade accountant and Communist Party member Zhu Guoqing excitedly said: "I was poisoned by 'Cultivation.' In the Cultural Revolution, I was not 'daring' but 'fearing,' carrying the 'self' and participating in the conservative organization, falling for the enemy's trick." Through studying the "Old Three Articles" and thoroughly criticizing "Cultivation," everyone further recognized that the "Old Three Articles" are the guide to action, the soul of revolutionaries, and the family treasure to forever protect the proletarian state. They recognized that "Cultivation" is a big poisonous weed of revisionism, advocating individualism in a roundabout way, a "opium" poisoning the souls of the poor and lower-middle peasants, and the general program for China's Khrushchev to restore capitalism. Everyone unanimously expressed: We must print the "Old Three Articles" in our minds, dissolve them in our blood, and implement them in action. We must not believe the deceptive talk in "Cultivation" and must uproot the poison of "Cultivation." Now, the entire brigade is in the midst of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works.

To deeply and thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road politically, ideologically, and theoretically, they linked the actual situation of their village, firmly grasped the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in rural areas, and concentrated on criticizing China's Khrushchev's reactionary fallacies such as "three autonomies and one contract," "four freedoms," and "three horses, one plow, and one cart style of peasants." They utilized the resting time in the fields, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, organizing revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres to carry out in-depth criticisms, further enhancing the production enthusiasm of the members. The broad masses of members actively participated in collective production labor, and everywhere was a scene of fighting for high yields and a bumper harvest.

　　永兴大队贫下中农以毛泽东思想为武器口诛笔伐中国的赫鲁晓夫
　　大学“老三篇”，批判《修养》骗人鬼话
　　开展回忆对比，痛斥“欢迎剥削”谬论
    本报讯　黑龙江巴彦县临城公社永兴大队广大贫下中农，遵照毛主席关于“公社农民以农为主，……也要批判资产阶级”“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，高举革命的批判旗帜，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，采用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论等方法，口诛笔伐，愤怒声讨党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行。
    毛主席说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”这个大队的无产阶级革命派遵照毛主席这一教导，首先进行了思想发动工作。他们组织广大贫下中农反复学习毛主席有关阶级斗争的语录和报纸上发表的有关文章。通过学习，大家一致认识到同党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争，是无产阶级同资产阶级的大斗争，是马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想同修正主义思想的大斗争，是无产阶级反对资本主义复辟的大斗争。苦大仇深的老贫农王义愤怒地说：“我这回才清楚了，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派要我们走资本主义道路，让我们贫下中农受二遍苦，我们一千个不答应。”广大贫下中农和革命干部提高了认识，便利用休息时间，纷纷举行批判会，写大字报，口诛笔伐，向党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火。生产队室内外的墙上贴满了痛斥中国赫鲁晓夫的大字报、大标语。他们还将中国赫鲁晓夫的罪行印成传单，散发到各家各户，做到了家喻户晓，人人皆知，激起了广大贫下中农的无比愤慨。大队和生产队先后召开批判会三十余次，发言的革命群众和革命干部三百七十五人，掀起了一个群众性的大批判高潮。
    在大批判中，他们开展新旧社会对比，忆苦思甜活动，激发无产阶级感情，决心加强无产阶级专政。先后有一百九十五人在大小队的会议上，回忆了家史、村史、合作化史，用自己的切身经历批判党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派鼓吹的“雇人劳动不叫剥削，它增加了社会财富”，“劳动人民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削”等反动谬论。通过新旧社会对比、三史教育，广大贫下中农更加无比仇恨中国的赫鲁晓夫，更加热爱伟大领袖毛主席。在诉苦会上，四队老贫农聂连友愤怒地控诉说：“中国的赫鲁晓夫说劳动人民不是反对剥削，而是欢迎剥削，我听了简直气炸肺了。在万恶的旧社会，我家四口人，两个劳力都养活不起家，成年滚在地主的土地里，还是吃糠咽菜，衣不遮体。”当他提到他父亲被逼当劳工，被日本鬼子活活烧死在工地上的悲惨情景时，全场革命群众怒不可遏地高呼：不忘阶级苦，永记血泪仇，誓死捍卫无产阶级专政！第二生产队队长李树春因为贫下中农曾给他贴了几张大字报，心里有怨气，工作不起劲。经过回忆诉苦和批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，他以“老三篇”为尺子，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，解决了思想问题。现在他积极组织社员学习毛主席著作，狠抓革命，猛促生产，队上的生产出现了新气象。
    这个大队广大贫下中农和革命干部在对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判中，把“老三篇”作为座右铭，采取亮思想，谈认识，查根源，找危害的方法，用当地生动事实，狠狠批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派代表作《修养》。有的犯错误的干部沉痛地控诉由于受了《修养》的毒害，忘掉了阶级斗争，脱离了贫下中农。大队会计、共产党员朱国祥激动地说：“我受了《修养》的毒害，在文化大革命运动中，不是‘敢’字当头，而是‘怕’字当头，带着‘私’字参加了保守组织，上了敌人的当。”通过学习“老三篇”，彻底批判《修养》，使大家进一步认识到“老三篇”是行动的指南，是革命战士的灵魂，是永保无产阶级江山不变颜色的传家宝。他们认识到，《修养》是修正主义的大毒草，转弯抹角提倡个人主义，是毒害贫下中农灵魂的“鸦片烟”，是中国的赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的总纲领。大家一致表示：要把“老三篇”印在脑子里，溶化在血液中，落实到行动上。决不能听信《修养》的骗人鬼话，要连根铲除《修养》的流毒。现在，全大队活学活用毛主席著作蔚然成风。
    为了从政治上、思想上、理论上把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批深、批透，他们联系本村实际，紧紧抓住农村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，集中批判中国的赫鲁晓夫的“三自一包”、“四大自由”、“三马一犁一车式的农民”等反动谬论。他们利用地头休息时间，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，组织革命群众和革命干部进行深入的批判，进一步提高了社员的集体生产积极性，广大社员积极参加集体生产劳动，到处是一派争高产、夺丰收的战斗景象。
