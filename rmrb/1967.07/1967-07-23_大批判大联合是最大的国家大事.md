		Always be concerned about major national affairs and never forget the direction of the struggle. This is the duty of the proletarian revolutionary faction. Currently, conducting revolutionary criticism and achieving revolutionary unity is the greatest national affair and the greatest direction. If we do not uphold this great direction, who will? If we do not pay attention to this national affair, who will? We must concentrate our greatest efforts and muster our greatest enthusiasm to launch a total offensive against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. We must criticize them thoroughly, leaving them with no defense.

		The paper tiger has not yet died, and the fallen dog still wants to get back on its feet; this is the reality. Tigers will eat people when they see them, and mad dogs will bite people when they encounter them; this is the rule. Facing the enemy, we must understand the big picture, consider the overall situation, use big principles to manage small principles, seek common ground while reserving differences, and achieve revolutionary unity. If there are still people who, day in and day out, wave the banner of small groups, carry the sign of small factions, guard the fortress of small hills, and calculate with small abacuses, indulging in self-admiration and delighting in trivial matters, then they will commit the greatest mistake.

		There are a thousand contradictions and ten thousand contradictions, but first, we must grasp the major contradictions; this is right, that is wrong, but first, we must resolve the major right and wrong issues. To conduct a major exposure, struggle, and criticism against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is to grasp the major contradiction and resolve the major right and wrong issues.

		“Once we grasp this principal contradiction, all problems will be solved,” and all right and wrong issues will be clearly distinguished. If there are still people who are not interested in the revolutionary criticism but instead focus on internal small issues, pick small faults, find small cracks, and cause small friction over small branches and small right and wrong issues, then they will go astray and exactly meet the needs of the class enemy.

		In summary, great criticism, great unity, great direction, great affairs, great principles, understanding the big picture, considering the overall situation, ... these "greats" are all about the character "public." While small groups, small hills, small actions, small principles, small friction, small worlds, small calculations, these "smalls" are all about the character "private."

		The great proletarian ideology, its core is the public. Therefore, it has boundless courage, a broad mind, profound thoughts, and clear foresight, because it always prioritizes the public in all matters.

		The petty-bourgeois ideology, its core is the "private." The "private" clouds the mind and narrows the heart, the "private" blinds the eyes and shortens the vision, therefore, it often gets entangled in small right and wrong issues and frequently argues over trivial matters.

		Only by breaking the "private" and establishing the "public," by breaking the bourgeois worldview and establishing the proletarian worldview, can we truly achieve revolutionary unity and truly conduct revolutionary criticism.

    大批判大联合是最大的国家大事
    梁世
    时时关心国家大事，念念不忘斗争大方向，是我们无产阶级革命派的天职。当前，进行革命的大批判，实行革命的大联合，就是最大的国家大事，最大的大方向。这样的大方向，我们不坚持，谁坚持？这样的国家大事，我们不关心，谁关心？我们必须集中最大的精力，鼓足最大的干劲，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，展开总攻击。大批特批，批得它体无完肤，片甲不留。
    纸老虎还没有死，落水狗仍想上岸，这是现实。老虎见人就要吃，疯狗遇人就要咬，这是规律。大敌当前，我们必须识大体，顾大局，用大道理管小道理，求大同存小异，实现革命的大联合。如果还有人整天打着小团体的旗子，扛着小宗派的牌子，守着小山头的寨子，拨着小算盘的珠子，在那里自我欣赏，津津乐道，那就要犯最大的错误。
    千矛盾，万矛盾，首先要抓大矛盾；这是非，那是非，首先要解决大是大非。对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行大揭发、大斗争、大批判，就是抓住最大的矛盾，解决最大的是非。
  “捉住了这个主要矛盾，一切问题就迎刃而解了”，一切是非也就界限分明了。如果还有人对革命的大批判不感兴趣，而专门在内部抓小辫子，挑小毛病，找小裂缝，搞小磨擦，在一些小枝小节，小是小非上闹纠纷，那就要误入歧途，正好迎合了阶级敌人的需要。
    总之，大批判、大联合、大方向、大事情、大道理、识大体、顾大局，……这些大，就大在一个“公”字上。而小团体、小山头、小动作、小道理、小磨擦、小天地、小算盘，这些小，就小在一个“私”字上。
    伟大的无产阶级思想，它的核心就是大公。因此具有万丈的豪气，宽广的胸怀，深邃的思想，明确的远见，就是由于它时时、事事以大公为重。
    小资产阶级意识，它的核心就是“私”字。“私”字迷了心窍就胸怀狭窄，
  “私”字障了眼睛就目光短浅，因此，往往在小是小非上纠缠，常常在枝节问题上争吵。
    只有破私立公，破资产阶级世界观，立无产阶级世界观，才能彻底实现革命的大联合，才能真正搞好革命的大批判。
