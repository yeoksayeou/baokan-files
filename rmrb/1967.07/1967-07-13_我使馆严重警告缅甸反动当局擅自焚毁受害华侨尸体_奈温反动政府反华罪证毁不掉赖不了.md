Our embassy has severely warned the reactionary Burmese government for unilaterally burning the bodies of victimized overseas Chinese. The Ne Win reactionary government's anti-China crimes cannot be destroyed or denied.

	New China News Agency, July 12th: Yangon News: The Chinese Embassy in Burma sent a note to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on July 11th, severely warning the Ne Win reactionary government that despite multiple warnings from the Chinese Embassy, it still secretly burned the bodies of overseas Chinese killed by mobs, attempting to destroy evidence. This is the second severe warning issued.

	The note pointed out that during this large-scale anti-China and anti-overseas Chinese wave, the Burmese reactionary government organized and incited a large number of fascist mobs to inhumanely massacre hundreds of patriotic overseas Chinese, committing unforgivable heinous crimes. The blood of the overseas Chinese will not be shed in vain! You owe a blood debt to the Chinese people that must be repaid!

	The note said that we have repeatedly requested you to make arrangements so that officials from the Chinese Embassy, along with the families of the deceased and missing overseas Chinese and representatives from the overseas Chinese community, can jointly inspect the bodies of the victimized overseas Chinese. We have also repeatedly warned you that without the inspection of our embassy officials, you are not allowed to unilaterally destroy the bodies and cover up the evidence, otherwise you will have to bear all the serious consequences. For this reason, we also submitted a note to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on July 2, 1967.

	The note sternly pointed out that you have blatantly ignored our legitimate requests and severe warnings. On July 2, 1967, you secretly burned many bodies of our victimized overseas Chinese behind the backs of the Chinese Embassy and the overseas Chinese community. On July 7 and 8, you added to your crimes by secretly burning the bodies of more than 40 victimized overseas Chinese behind our backs. After destroying the bodies and covering up the evidence, you then attempted to evade responsibility, playing tricks and shamelessly fabricating lies, claiming that "the Burmese government had invited two representatives from the overseas Chinese community to jointly inspect the bodies with officials from the Chinese Embassy, but this was rejected by the Chinese Embassy." This is a blatant lie. The fact is that you are terrified and hateful of our request, stubbornly refusing it. You are afraid of the Chinese Embassy meeting with the overseas Chinese community and the families of the deceased overseas Chinese. You are afraid that your bloody crimes of killing overseas Chinese will be exposed to the world. This itself shows that you are guilty as charged, you are the real culprits! Let me tell you, the eyes of 700 million Chinese people and revolutionary people around the world are sharp. You think you can destroy the bodies and cover up the evidence, but this will only make your butcher's ugly face more exposed! You have a mountain of blood debts and evidence, you cannot destroy it, you cannot deny it!

	The note pointed out that the Burmese reactionary authorities must immediately stop burning the bodies of our victimized overseas Chinese, immediately provide us with a list of the burned overseas Chinese bodies; immediately arrange for the families of the deceased and missing overseas Chinese and representatives from the overseas Chinese community to jointly inspect the remaining bodies of overseas Chinese with officials from the Chinese Embassy; immediately take responsibility for arranging a grand funeral, public memorial, and burial ceremony for the deceased overseas Chinese.

	The note once again severely warns: If you continue to ignore our legitimate requests and insist on going your own way, you will only face double the punishment!

    我使馆严重警告缅甸反动当局擅自焚毁受害华侨尸体
    奈温反动政府反华罪证毁不掉赖不了
    新华社十二日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆十一日照会缅甸外交部，对奈温反动政府不顾中国大使馆的多次警告，竟然背着中国大使馆和侨团代表擅自焚毁被暴徒杀害的华侨尸体，妄图销毁罪证，再次提出严重警告。
    照会指出，缅甸反动政府在这次大规模的反华、排华浪潮中，组织和纵容大批法西斯暴徒灭绝人性地惨害了数以百计的爱国华侨，犯下了不可饶恕的滔天罪行。华侨的鲜血绝不会白流！你们对中国人民欠下的血债一定要偿还！
    照会说，我们曾多次要求你们作出安排，以便中国大使馆官员会同死难、失踪华侨的家属和侨团代表一道去察验受害华侨的尸首，并一再警告你们非经我大使馆官员察验，不得擅自毁尸灭迹，否则你们必须承担一切严重后果。为此，我们还在一九六七年七月二日，专门向缅甸外交部递交了照会。
    照会严正指出，你们竟然无视我们的正当要求和严重警告，在一九六七年七月二日当天，背着中国大使馆和侨团代表擅自焚毁不少我受害华侨尸首。七日和八日，你们罪上加罪，背着我们焚毁四十多具被害华侨尸首。毁尸灭迹以后，你们又企图逃脱罪责，玩弄阴谋，公然无耻地制造谎言，胡说什么“缅甸政府曾要二名华侨代表会同中国大使馆官员一道前去验尸，遭到中国大使馆的拒绝。”这是弥天大谎。事实是你们对我们的这一要求怕得要死，恨得要命，一直顽固拒绝。你们害怕中国大使馆同侨团和死难侨胞亲人会面，你们害怕你们残杀华侨的血腥罪行被公诸于世。这本身就说明了你们作贼心虚，你们是地地道道的罪魁祸首！老实告诉你们，七亿中国人民和世界革命人民的眼睛是雪亮的，你们妄想毁尸灭迹欲盖弥彰，只能使你们刽子手的狰狞嘴脸更加暴露无遗！你们血债累累，罪证如山，毁不掉，赖不了！
    照会指出，缅甸反动当局必须立即停止焚烧我受害华侨的尸体，立即向我们提供已焚毁的华侨尸体的清单；立即安排死难、失踪华侨的家属和侨团代表会同中国大使馆人员一起察验尚存的华侨尸体；立即负责安排对死难华侨举行隆重的安葬、公祭和送葬仪式。
    照会再次严重警告：如果你们继续不顾我们的正当要求，一意孤行，蛮干到底，那么，你们所得到的只能是加倍的惩罚！
