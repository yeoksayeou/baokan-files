The third issue of the 1966 "Indonesian Forum," published in January, carried a self-criticism by the Central Political Bureau of the Indonesian Communist Party, titled "Building a Marxist-Leninist Indonesian Communist Party to Lead the Indonesian People's Democratic Revolution." The self-criticism states that after the failure of the September 30th Movement, the Indonesian Communist Party and the Indonesian people's revolutionary movement suffered severe losses, revealing significant weaknesses within the party that had been concealed for a long time.

The Political Bureau acknowledges its responsibility for the serious weaknesses and errors within the party over this period. Therefore, the Political Bureau is deeply concerned and places great importance on Marxist-Leninist criticism from cadres and party members, as well as sincere criticism from party sympathizers in various forms. The Political Bureau is determined to carry out Marxist-Leninist self-criticism, following Lenin's teachings and taking Musso's Marxist-Leninist criticism and self-criticism as an example.

The self-criticism notes that under the most brutal and savage white terror of the Nasution-Suharto military right-wing clique, it is difficult to conduct such comprehensive criticism and self-criticism. To address the urgent needs, it is necessary to first raise fundamental issues in ideology, politics, and organization as the basis for studying the party's weaknesses and errors in the current rectification movement.

The Political Bureau humbly and sincerely presents this self-criticism. The Political Bureau hopes that every party member will adopt a critical attitude and actively participate in the discussion of the party's leadership weaknesses and errors, drawing lessons from collective or individual experiences, and making every effort to perfect the self-criticism of the Central Political Bureau of the Indonesian Communist Party. The Political Bureau hopes that every party member will adhere to the principles of "unity-criticism-unity" and "learn from the past and cure the sickness to save the patient," thereby achieving the dual goals of clarifying thoughts and uniting comrades. The Political Bureau believes that by adhering to this correct principle, every party member will be determined to rebuild the Marxist-Leninist Indonesian Communist Party, strengthen the unity and solidarity of communists, enhance ideological, political, and organizational vigilance, and bolster the resolve to fight for victory. They will participate in this movement to study and overcome weaknesses and errors.

In the realm of ideology, the self-criticism points out that the party's serious weaknesses and errors since 1951 stem from ideological weaknesses, primarily in the party leadership. The party leadership not only failed to integrate revolutionary theory with the specific practices of the Indonesian revolution but also deviated from the guidance of the most advanced theory. This experience shows that the Indonesian Communist Party has not yet formed a leadership core composed of proletarian elements who have a truly correct, systematic, and practical understanding of Marxism-Leninism, rather than a fragmented and hollow understanding.

The self-criticism states that since 1951, subjectivism has been developing and becoming more severe, leading to right-opportunist errors that combined with the influence of modern revisionism in the international communist movement. This right-opportunist line became the main characteristic of the Indonesian Communist Party's errors during this period. The factors that allowed these weaknesses and errors to grow and develop include:

First, within the party, especially among the party leadership, the tradition of Marxist-Leninist criticism and self-criticism was not fostered. The party sometimes launched rectification or study movements, but these were not conducted seriously and thoroughly, nor were they properly summarized. Necessary organizational measures were not taken. These study movements were more directed at the lower levels and never targeted the leadership for criticism and self-criticism. Criticisms from below were not properly guided but suppressed.

Second, due to the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, mainly through two channels: when the party established a united front with the national bourgeoisie and when cadres, especially leading cadres, took positions in government or semi-official institutions, they themselves became bourgeoisified. More and more party cadres held positions in central and local government institutions and semi-official institutions, creating a "bourgeoisified worker class," which are the true propagators of "reformism." This situation did not exist before the August 1945 revolution.

Third, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Fifth Central Committee uncritically adopted the report agreeing with the line of the 20th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, making the line of "achieving socialism through parliamentary and peaceful means" the party's line. From this point on, modern revisionism began to infiltrate the party. At the Sixth National Congress of the Indonesian Communist Party, the peaceful path, as a characteristic of modern revisionism, was further solidified, with the following statement in the party constitution: "In Indonesia, the people's democratic system, as a transitional stage to socialism, can be realized through peaceful and parliamentary means. This is a possibility. The Indonesian Communist Party strives to make this possibility a reality." This revisionist line was reiterated at the Seventh National Congress and has never been corrected, despite the party's recognition that the Soviet leadership had taken the path of modern revisionism since the 20th Congress.

The self-criticism emphasizes that the experience of the Indonesian Communist Party shows that taking a critical attitude towards Soviet modern revisionism does not mean that the Indonesian Communist Party will naturally avoid the same right-opportunist errors made by modern revisionists. The experience of the Indonesian Communist Party shows that modern revisionism is the greatest danger in the international communist movement and also the greatest danger to the Indonesian Communist Party. Modern revisionism is not a "latent, non-sharp danger" but a real danger that has already caused serious damage to the Indonesian Communist Party and brought great losses to the Indonesian people's revolutionary movement. Therefore, the danger of modern revisionism must not be ignored, and it must be fought against mercilessly. Only after the party abandons the line of "maintaining friendly relations with modern revisionists" can it effectively oppose modern revisionism in all aspects with a clear attitude.

The Indonesian Communist Party, on the one hand, criticizes the modern revisionism of the Soviet leadership, but on the other hand, also commits revisionist errors because it revises the Marxist-Leninist theories on class struggle, the state, and revolution. This is a fact. Furthermore, the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party did not, as Lenin taught, fight against various ideological currents in revolutionary thought that could lead the proletariat astray, but willingly made theoretical concessions. The leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party once equated the three components of Marxism (materialist philosophy, political economy, and scientific socialism) with the three components of "Gano's theory"; they wanted to turn the proletarian ideology of Marxism into the ideology of the entire nation, even though there are exploiting classes within the nation that are hostile to the proletariat.

In the realm of politics, the self-criticism states that the current review of right-opportunist errors in politics includes three issues: (1) the path to achieving Indonesian people's democracy; (2) the issue of state power; (3) the implementation of the national united front.

The self-criticism states that one fundamental difference and contradiction between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism lies in the question of the path to socialism. Marxism-Leninism teaches that achieving socialism requires the path of proletarian revolution, while colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal countries like Indonesia must first go through the stage of people's democratic revolution. Revisionism, on the other hand, fantasizes about achieving socialism through peaceful means.

The self-criticism points out that in the initial years of this period since 1951, the party achieved certain successes in political struggle and party building. An important achievement of this period was the discussion of the fundamental issues of the Indonesian revolution. It was stated that the current stage of the Indonesian revolution is a new-type bourgeois democratic revolution, whose task is to eliminate the remnants of imperialism and feudalism and establish a people's democratic system as a transitional stage to socialism. The driving force of the revolution is the working class, peasants, and petty bourgeoisie, with the working class as the leading force and peasants as the main mass force. It was also mentioned that the national bourgeoisie is an unstable revolutionary force that can stand on the side of the revolution in certain periods and to some extent, but may betray the revolution in other periods. The party also stated that the working class, in order to fulfill its role as the leader of the Indonesian revolution, must unite with all other revolutionary classes and strata on the basis of a worker-peasant alliance led by the working class to form a revolutionary united front.

However, a very important weakness that later developed into a right-opportunist or revisionist tendency was that the party had not reached a clear ideological consensus on the main tasks and main forms of struggle in the Indonesian revolution.

The self-criticism points out that the Chinese revolution provided experience in the main forms of struggle in colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal countries, which is armed people's struggle against armed counter-revolution. Since the essence of the revolution is the land revolution, this armed people's struggle is essentially the armed peasant land revolution led by the working class. The practice of the Chinese revolution was first to apply Marxism-Leninism to the specific conditions of China. At the same time, it also proposed the universal laws of the people's revolution in colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal countries.

The self-criticism emphasizes that the Indonesian revolution must also achieve complete victory by following the path of the Chinese revolution. This means that the Indonesian revolution inevitably must adopt the main form of struggle of armed people's struggle against armed counter-revolution, whose essence is the armed peasant land revolution under the leadership of the proletariat.

The self-criticism states that all legal and parliamentary forms of struggle must serve the main form of struggle or activity and must not hinder the maturation process of armed struggle.

The experience of the past fifteen years shows that from the beginning of not clearly opposing the peaceful path and not insisting on the universal laws of revolution in colonial, semi-colonial, and semi-feudal countries, the Indonesian Communist Party increasingly fell into parliamentary struggle and other legal forms of struggle. The party leadership even regarded these forms of struggle as the main forms of struggle to achieve the strategic goals of the Indonesian revolution. The party's legal status was not seen as a form of struggle in certain periods and under certain conditions but as a principle, with all other forms of struggle serving this principle. Even when the counter-revolution not only stripped the party of its legal status but also stripped communists of their human rights, efforts were still made to insist on this "legal status."

The self-criticism states that from the time the Fourth Plenary Session of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party (1956) adopted the document agreeing with the modern revisionist line of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the "peaceful path" began to be established within the party. Under the condition that the revisionist line had been established within the party, it was impossible for the party to have a correct Marxist-Leninist strategic and tactical line. The initial formulation of the party's strategic and basic tactical line was ambiguous on the issue of the "peaceful path" or "armed revolutionary path" and eventually developed into the "peaceful path" dominating.

It was under these circumstances that the Indonesian Communist Party put forward its general line at the Sixth National Congress (1959), which was to "continue to build the national united front and continue party building to realize the demands of the August 1945 revolution." Based on this general line, the slogan of "raising the party's three banners" was formulated. These are: (1) the banner of the national united front; (2) the banner of party building; (3) the banner of the August 1945 revolution. This general line was regarded as the path to Indonesian people's democracy.

The party leadership tried to explain that the party's three banners are the three main weapons for achieving victory in the people's democratic revolution, just as Comrade Mao Zedong proposed: "A disciplined party armed with Marxism-Leninism, practicing self-criticism, and closely linked with the masses. An army led by such a party. A united front of all revolutionary classes and factions led by such a party."

The second main weapon implies armed people's struggle against armed counter-revolution under the leadership of the party. The party leadership, however, wanted to replace it with the slogan of "raising the banner of the August 1945 revolution."

The party leadership, in order to prove that the path it took was not the opportunist "peaceful path," often talked about two possibilities, namely the possibility of a peaceful path and the possibility of a non-peaceful path; the better the party prepared for the non-peaceful path, the greater the possibility of a peaceful path. In this way, the hope of a peaceful path, which in reality does not exist, was constantly spread to party members, the working class, and the masses of laboring people.

In practice, the party leadership did not prepare the entire party, the working class, and the masses of people to deal with the possibility of a non-peaceful path. The most obvious evidence of this is the tragic aftermath of the September 30th Movement. The counter-revolution was able to massacre and arrest tens of thousands of communists and non-party revolutionaries in a short period of time, who were in a passive situation, and paralyzed the Indonesian Communist Party organization and revolutionary mass organizations. If the party leadership had not deviated from the revolutionary path, this situation would not have occurred.

The self-criticism states that the party leadership proposed that "the party cannot copy foreign theories of armed struggle but must adopt a method of combining three forms of struggle: guerrilla warfare in the countryside (with tenant farmers and poor peasants as the main participants); revolutionary struggle of workers in the cities (mainly transport workers); and effective work within the enemy's armed forces." The party leadership criticized some comrades for only seeing the commonalities when learning from the experience of the Chinese people's armed struggle. In contrast, the party leadership proposed some different conditions that must be considered, leading to the conclusion that the special method of the Indonesian revolution is the "method of combining three forms of struggle."

The self-criticism states that to complete the arduous and glorious historical task of leading the people's revolution against imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, Indonesian Marxist-Leninists must resolutely abandon the revisionist peaceful path and the "theory of combining three forms of struggle," and raise the banner of armed people's revolution. At the same time, as in the great Chinese people's revolution, Indonesian Marxist-Leninists must establish revolutionary bases; they "must turn backward rural areas into advanced and consolidated bases, into great revolutionary strongholds in military, political, economic, and cultural terms."

While addressing this most fundamental issue, we must also adopt other forms of struggle; without the cooperation of other forms of struggle, armed struggle will not make progress.

The self-criticism points out that the right-opportunist line of the party leadership is also reflected in its attitude towards the state, especially the Republic of Indonesia.

According to the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state, after the failure of the August 1945 revolution, the task of the Indonesian Communist Party should have been to educate the Indonesian working class and laboring people to clearly understand that the class nature of the state of the Republic of Indonesia is bourgeois dictatorship. The Indonesian Communist Party should have awakened the consciousness of the Indonesian working class and other laboring people, making them understand that their liberation struggle inevitably must move towards "violent revolution," replacing the bourgeois state with a people's state led by the working class. However, the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party implemented an opportunist line, causing illusions about bourgeois democracy among the people.

The self-criticism states that the party leadership's error of deviating from the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state reached its peak with the emergence of the "theory of the two aspects of the Republic of Indonesia's power."

The "theory of the two aspects" proposes the following view on the state and state power: "The state power of the Republic of Indonesia, viewed as a contradiction, is a contradiction between two opposing aspects. The first aspect: the aspect representing the interests of the people (embodied in the progressive attitude and policies of President Sukarno, which were supported by the Indonesian Communist Party and other people's strata). The second aspect: the aspect representing the interests of the people's enemies (embodied in the attitudes and policies of the right-wing or die-hard faction). The people's aspect has already become the main aspect and plays a leading role within the state power of the Republic of Indonesia."

The "theory of the two aspects" is clearly an opportunist or revisionist error because it denies the Marxist-Leninist theory that the state is an instrument of the rule of a certain class, which cannot reconcile with the opposing side (the class opposing it). The Republic of Indonesia cannot be ruled jointly by the people and the people's enemies.

The self-criticism states that the party leadership, already mired in opportunism, believed that the "people's aspect" had become the main aspect and was playing a leading role within the state power of the Republic of Indonesia, as if the Indonesian people were already close to establishing a people's government. At the same time, because the national bourgeoisie was seen as the true "people's aspect" within the state power, the party leadership spared no effort to maintain and develop this "people's aspect." The party leadership had completely merged itself into the interests of the national bourgeoisie.

Viewing the position of the national bourgeoisie as the "people's aspect" within the state power of the Republic of Indonesia and seeing President Sukarno as the leader meant believing that the national bourgeoisie could lead the new-type bourgeois democratic revolution. This is contrary to historical necessity and historical facts.

The leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party said that the "theory of the two aspects" is completely different from the "theory of structural reform" of the revisionist leadership of the Italian Communist Party. However, whether from a theoretical or practical point of view, these two "theories" are indistinguishable. Both start from achieving socialism through peaceful means, both fantasize about gradually changing the state structure and the balance of internal forces, both reject the revolutionary path, and both are revisionist.

This anti-revolutionary "theory of the two aspects" is clearly reflected in the following explanation: "The struggle of the Indonesian Communist Party in the state power is to make the aspect supporting the people increasingly stronger and able to dominate, while excluding anti-people forces from the state power."

The party leadership even called this anti-revolutionary path the "revolution from above and below." The meaning of "from above" is that the Indonesian Communist Party must push the state power to take revolutionary measures to reform personnel and state tools. The meaning of "from below" is to arouse, organize, and mobilize the people to achieve the aforementioned reforms. What a fantastic fantasy! The party leadership did not learn from the fact that since the announcement of President Sukarno's plan to form a cooperative cabinet (an old-style national united government) eight years ago, despite repeated demands, there has never been any sign that it will be implemented, let alone a change in the state power!

The self-criticism emphasizes that to cleanse the opportunist mud, our party must abandon the "theory of the two aspects of state power" and re-establish the Marxist-Leninist theory of the state and revolution.

The self-criticism states that the Fifth National Congress of the party basically solved the problem of the national united front from a theoretical perspective and made regulations about the worker-peasant alliance as the basis of the national united front. Regarding the national bourgeoisie, based on the experience of the August Revolution, lessons had been learned: this class's attitude is wavering. In certain situations, the national bourgeoisie participates in and supports the revolution, while in other situations, it follows the comprador bourgeoisie to strike at the revolutionary forces and betray the revolution (the Malili incident and the agreement of the Round Table Conference). Based on the wavering attitude of the national bourgeoisie, the Indonesian Communist Party stipulated the attitude that must be taken, which is to always strive to bring the national bourgeoisie into the revolution but also to guard against the possibility of the national bourgeoisie betraying the revolution. The Indonesian Communist Party must adopt a policy of both uniting with and struggling against the national bourgeoisie.

Nevertheless, due to the subjective ideological weaknesses within the party, especially within the party leadership, which have not been completely overcome, our party has increasingly fallen into error, to the point where the party lost its independence in the united front with the national bourgeoisie. This error made the party and the proletariat into appendages of the national bourgeoisie.

The self-criticism states that one manifestation of the party losing its independence in the united front with the national bourgeoisie is the issue of the party leadership's attitude and evaluation of Gano. The party leadership did not take an independent attitude towards Gano but avoided contradictions and always emphasized the common points and unity between the party and Gano. What the people saw was that there was no policy of Gano that did not receive the support of the Indonesian Communist Party. The party leadership even acknowledged Gano as a great revolutionary leader and the leader of the "people's aspect" within the state power of the Republic of Indonesia without struggle. The party leadership expressed in many articles and speeches that all actions of the Indonesian Communist Party, in addition to being based on Marxism-Leninism, were also based on "Gano's theory," claiming that the rapid development of the Indonesian Communist Party was due to the implementation of Gano's "Nasakom" unity of thought, and even saying that the concept of the Indonesian people's democratic system conformed to the basic ideas in Gano's speech "The Birth of the Five Principles of the State" (June 1, 1945).

The self-criticism criticized the error of "strictly implementing the Political Declaration is equivalent to implementing the program of the Indonesian Communist Party," pointing out that the claim that strictly implementing the Political Declaration is equivalent to implementing the program of the Indonesian Communist Party means that it is not the bourgeoisie that accepts the program of the Indonesian Communist Party, but the Indonesian Communist Party that accepts the program of the national bourgeoisie, and uses it to replace the program of the Indonesian Communist Party.

The self-criticism states that the situation of sacrificing principles in the united front with the national bourgeoisie further developed with the proposal of the so-called "general line of the Indonesian revolution." This general line stipulates that "through a national united front based on workers and peasants as the pillars, with 'Nasakom' as the core, and based on the ideal of the Five Principles of the State, complete the national democratic revolution and move towards Indonesian socialism." This so-called "general line of the Indonesian revolution" has no revolutionary flavor. Because the three conditions for achieving revolutionary victory, namely a strong Marxist-Leninist party, armed people's struggle under the leadership of the party, and a national united front, are reduced to only the national united front. Moreover, this is no longer a revolutionary national united front, because it is not based on the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class, but on "Nasakom."

The party leadership said that the slogan of "national mutual assistance and cooperation with 'Nasakom' as the core" "cannot blur the class content of the national united front." This statement is incorrect. The class content of "Nasakom" includes the working class, the national bourgeoisie, and even comprador elements, bureaucratic capitalists, and landlords. Obviously, taking "Nasakom" as the core not only blurs the class content of the national united front but also completely changes the meaning of the revolutionary national united front into an alliance of the working class with all classes, including reactionary classes, or into class cooperation.

This error must be corrected. The party must abandon the erroneous "general line of the Indonesian revolution" and return to the correct plan, which is to return to the revolutionary national united front based on the leadership of the working class and the worker-peasant alliance.

The self-criticism states that the situation of sacrificing principles in the united front with the national bourgeoisie also occurred because the party did not correctly analyze the specific situation.

The self-criticism points out that after the failure of the August 1945 revolution, except for West Irian, the imperialists did not directly hold power in Indonesia. The power in Indonesia was in the hands of the comprador class and landlords representing the interests of imperialism and feudal remnants. Indonesia was not in a situation of imperialist aggression. Under these circumstances, if the Indonesian Communist Party did not make political errors, the contradictions between the ruling reactionary classes and the people would sharpen and become the main contradiction in Indonesia. The primary task of the Indonesian revolution is to overthrow the rule of the various reactionary classes within the country; they are also representatives of the interests of imperialism, especially American imperialism. Only this path can truly overthrow imperialism and the remnants of feudalism.

Correcting the party's errors in the united front with the national bourgeoisie does not mean that the party no longer needs to unite with this class. The party must, based on the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class, strive to bring the national bourgeoisie to the side of the revolution.

In the realm of organization, the self-criticism states that the erroneous political line dominating the party cannot but bring about an erroneous organizational line. The longer and deeper the erroneous political line dominates within the party, the greater the organizational errors and the greater the losses. In the period after 1951, the party's erroneous political line was right-opportunism, and the organizational line that followed was also right-opportunism, which is liberalism and legalism.

The organizational line of liberalism is reflected in the tendency to turn the Indonesian Communist Party into a party with the most members, a loose organization, and a party called the masses.

The self-criticism states that the mass nature of the party is first and foremost not reflected in the large number of party members but in its close connection with the masses, in its political line that defends the interests of the people, or in its implementation of the mass line. Only when the party insists on its vanguard conditions, only when the party is composed of the outstanding elements of the proletariat and armed with Marxist-Leninist theory, can the party insist on its mass line. Therefore, building a Marxist-Leninist party with mass character cannot but emphasize Marxist-Leninist education.

The self-criticism points out that in recent years, the Indonesian Communist Party has implemented a party-building line that violates the Marxist-Leninist principles of organization.

The self-criticism states that the liberal development of party members is inseparable from the political line of seeking the peaceful path. Using a large number of party members to achieve the goal of expanding the party's influence in the united front with the national bourgeoisie. Through an increasingly large party and continued unity with the national bourgeoisie, a balance of power can be created that can completely defeat the die-hard forces.

What is emphasized is no longer the education and training of Marxist-Leninist cadres to prepare for the revolution, to work among the peasants, and to establish revolutionary bases, but the education of intellectuals to adapt to the work of the united front with the national bourgeoisie, to take up some positions in the state institutions obtained through such cooperation. The slogan of "completely combining with the peasants" becomes pure talk. What is implemented is not sending the best cadres to the countryside but transferring cadres from the countryside to the cities and from local areas to the center.

To make the bourgeoisie respect and honor the party, to make the party seen as a party of learned people, the four-year plan stipulates that all high-level cadres of the party must complete college-level education, middle-level cadres complete high school education, and lower-level cadres complete junior high school education. To meet this need, many schools and training classes were established. Intellectualism has deeply influenced the party leadership to the extent that all party leaders and leaders of the people's movement are required to write four essays to obtain the title of Marxist scholar.

The deeper the party is mired in the swamp of right-opportunism or revisionism, the more it loses organizational vigilance, and legalism develops within the organization. The party leadership has lost class vigilance towards the hypocrisy of bourgeois democracy. All party activities show as if the peaceful path is very certain. The party leadership did not arouse vigilance among the party masses about the danger of the reactionaries constantly waiting for an opportunity to attack. It is precisely because of this organizational legalism that the counter-revolution was able to paralyze the organization of the Indonesian Communist Party in a short time.

Organizational liberalism destroyed the democratic principles within the party, destroyed collective leadership, fostered personal leadership and power, and fostered autonomism.

Under the organizational line of liberalism, it is impossible to implement the party's work style, which is "combining theory with practice, closely linking with the masses, and practicing self-criticism." It is also impossible to implement the leadership method with the core of combining leaders and masses, which requires the upper level to set an example for the lower level.

The self-criticism points out that the erroneous organizational line brought about by the erroneous political line dominating within the party has destroyed the principles of the Marxist-Leninist party, destroyed the organizational foundation of the party, which is democratic centralism, and also destroyed the work style and leadership methods of the party.

The self-criticism emphasizes that to build the Indonesian Communist Party into a Marxist-Leninist party, it is necessary to thoroughly expose organizational liberalism and the ideological roots that produce liberalism. It is necessary to rebuild the Indonesian Communist Party into a Leninist party, to build it into a party that can fulfill the task of being the advanced detachment and highest organizational form of the Indonesian proletariat, to build it into a party that can undertake the historical task of leading the Indonesian people to win the anti-imperialist, anti-feudal, and anti-bureaucratic capitalist revolution and move towards socialism. Such a party must meet the following conditions: ideologically, it must be armed with Marxist-Leninist theory, free from subjectivism, opportunism, and modern revisionism; politically, it must have a correct program, including a revolutionary land program, grasp the strategic and tactical issues of the Indonesian revolution—grasp the main form of struggle, which is the armed peasant struggle under the leadership of the proletariat, and grasp other forms of struggle, be good at establishing a revolutionary united front based on the leadership of the working class, the worker-peasant alliance, and including all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal classes and strata; organizationally, it must have a solid and deep foundation among the people, composed of reliable, experienced, and tested party members, and become a model in carrying out national tasks.

At present, we are rebuilding the party under the most brutal and savage rule of the counter-revolutionary terror. The legal status of the party and the human rights of communists have been completely stripped away. Therefore, the party must completely organize and work in an illegal manner. When working completely in an illegal manner, the party must be good at using every possible opportunity to carry out legal activities according to the situation, using methods that the masses can accept to mobilize and lead the masses' struggle, gradually raising it to a higher stage.

The self-criticism emphasizes that when rebuilding the Marxist-Leninist Indonesian Communist Party, the greatest attention must be paid to party-building work in the countryside and the work of establishing revolutionary bases.

The above tasks of rebuilding the Marxist-Leninist Indonesian Communist Party are arduous, dangerous, and long-term, so they must be carried out bravely, diligently, cautiously, patiently, and perseveringly.

The self-criticism states that after understanding the weaknesses and errors of the party since 1951, the urgent task facing Indonesian Marxist-Leninists is clear. This is:

First, to rebuild the Indonesian Communist Party into a Marxist-Leninist party free from subjectivism, opportunism, and modern revisionism.

To rebuild such a Marxist-Leninist party, party cadres and members at all levels must reach a consensus on the errors the party has made in the past and the new path that must be taken in the future.

To achieve consensus, a rectification movement must be carried out throughout the party. We plan to change the past erroneous thoughts through the rectification movement and establish correct thoughts. To take the correct path, it is absolutely necessary to abandon the erroneous path.

In the current situation, it is not easy to reach a consensus on all past errors, including detailed issues. However, for the major issues as expounded in this self-criticism, consensus is absolutely necessary.

The self-criticism states that the errors in politics and organization that we are correcting today are not only the product of the social and historical conditions of the past ten years but also have deeper roots, namely the social and historical conditions since the founding of our party. Therefore, do not think that the problem is solved after this criticism and self-criticism. As long as subjectivist thoughts are not cleared from within the party, especially in the party leadership, the party cannot avoid right or "left" opportunist errors because the party cannot correctly analyze the political situation and cannot issue correct work instructions. The central leadership and cadres, as well as local leaders and cadres at all levels, have the primary duty to wage a full-scale war against subjectivism.

Only when the entire party improves its ability to distinguish proletarian thoughts from petty-bourgeois thoughts and carries out criticism and self-criticism can it effectively oppose and eliminate subjectivism. Only by strengthening Marxist-Leninist education can the entire party improve its ability to distinguish proletarian thoughts from petty-bourgeois thoughts. The party must educate party members to use Marxist-Leninist methods to analyze political situations and estimate class forces, avoiding subjective analysis and estimation. The party must urge party members to pay attention to investigating and studying social and economic conditions so that they can formulate struggle strategies and work methods; it must help party members realize that without investigating actual conditions, they will fall into illusions.

The self-criticism emphasizes that the party's experience in struggles over various periods shows that for Indonesian Marxist-Leninists who are determined to defend Marxism-Leninism and oppose modern revisionism, studying the theories of Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin, especially studying Mao Zedong Thought, is of great importance. Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, bringing Marxism-Leninism to the peak of the contemporary era.

Only by taking a clear attitude to oppose the modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership, can the Indonesian Communist Party raise the banner of Marxism-Leninism. Opposing modern revisionism cannot be done while maintaining friendly relations with modern revisionists. The Indonesian Communist Party must abandon the erroneous attitude of maintaining relations with modern revisionism in the past. Only by taking an uncompromising attitude to oppose modern revisionism can it demonstrate loyalty to proletarian internationalism, because modern revisionism destroys proletarian internationalism and betrays the struggle of the proletariat and the oppressed peoples of the world.

When rebuilding the party, Indonesian Marxist-Leninists must pay attention to creating conditions for leading the armed peasant land revolution, which will be the main form of struggle for winning the victory of the Indonesian people's democratic revolution. This means that the greatest attention must be paid to rebuilding the party organization in the countryside. The greatest attention must be paid to solving the problem of arousing, organizing, and mobilizing the peasants in the anti-feudal land revolution. The party must truly achieve unity with the peasants, especially with tenant farmers and poor peasants. Only through this unity can the party lead the peasants, and the peasants can become an invincible fortress of the people's democratic revolution.

Due to the impact of the third white terror, the party's organization in the countryside has suffered even more severe damage, making work in the countryside more difficult and arduous. However, this does not change the correctness of the law that peasants are the main force of the Indonesian people's democratic revolution and the countryside is its base. As long as Indonesian Marxist-Leninists are determined, everything for the people, they will definitely be able to overcome these serious difficulties. As long as Indonesian Marxist-Leninists fully trust the masses and rely on the masses, they will definitely be able to turn backward Indonesian villages into strong and consolidated revolutionary fortresses in military, political, and cultural terms.

The peasants of Indonesia are most concerned about the people's democratic revolution. Because only this revolution can liberate them from the backward and extremely unreasonable life caused by feudal oppression. Only this revolution can give the peasants the land they have longed for all their lives. Therefore, no matter how difficult and tortuous, the peasants will definitely take the revolutionary path for land and freedom.

Obviously, the second task facing Indonesian Marxist-Leninists at present is to create the necessary conditions for the armed peasant land revolution led by the proletariat. If Indonesian Marxist-Leninists can arouse, organize, and mobilize the peasants to carry out the anti-feudal land revolution, then the leadership of the working class in the people's democratic revolution will be guaranteed, and victory will be guaranteed.

However, the party must still strive to establish a revolutionary united front with other anti-imperialist and anti-feudal classes and strata. On the basis of the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class, the party must strive to win over the urban petty bourgeoisie and other democrats, and also strive to win over the national bourgeoisie as a reserve ally of the people's democratic revolution. The current objective conditions make it possible to establish a broad revolutionary united front.

The military dictatorship of the right-wing army clique of Nasution-Suharto is only the embodiment of the most reactionary classes within the country, namely the comprador bourgeoisie, bureaucratic capitalists, and landlords. The domestic reactionary classes led by the right-wing army clique implement dictatorship over the people, acting as the running dogs of imperialism, especially American imperialism, in Indonesia. Therefore, under their rule, the oppression and exploitation of imperialism and feudalism on the Indonesian people will inevitably become more severe.

The military dictatorship of the right-wing army clique only represents the interests of a very small minority and oppresses the vast majority of the Indonesian people. Therefore, the military dictatorship of the right-wing army clique will inevitably face the resistance of the broad masses of the people.

Therefore, the third urgent task facing Indonesian Marxist-Leninists is to establish a revolutionary united front with all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal classes and strata, based on the leadership of the working class and the worker-peasant alliance.

Obviously, to win the victory of the people's democratic revolution, Indonesian Marxist-Leninists must raise the party's three banners.

The first banner is to build a Marxist-Leninist party free from subjectivism, opportunism, and modern revisionism.

The second banner is to carry out armed people's struggle, whose essence is the armed peasant land revolution led by the working class against feudalism.

The third banner is to establish a revolutionary united front based on the leadership of the working class and the worker-peasant alliance.

The tasks facing Indonesian Marxist-Leninists are extremely arduous. They must work under the unprecedented most savage and brutal terror. However, Indonesian Marxist-Leninists are convinced that after correcting the party's past errors, they are now on the correct path, the path of the people's democratic revolution. No matter how long, tortuous, and difficult this path is, it is the only path to a free, democratic new Indonesia—an Indonesia that truly belongs to the Indonesian people. For this, one must dare to take the long path.

The self-criticism points out that based on their own struggle experience, Indonesian Marxist-Leninists and revolutionaries have no doubt about the correctness of Comrade Mao Zedong's point that imperialism and reactionaries are paper tigers. They look frightening, but in reality, they are weak. From a long-term perspective, the truly strong ones are the people. The current ruling military dictatorship of the right-wing army clique is also a paper tiger. They look strong and frightening, but in reality, they are weak because they do not have the support of the people but are opposed by the people; they are full of internal contradictions and fight for power among themselves. Imperialists, especially the American imperialists who support the military dictatorship of the right-wing army clique, are also paper tigers. They look strong and frightening, but in reality, they are weak and heading towards collapse. The weakness of imperialism, especially American imperialism, is shown in their inability to conquer the heroic Vietnamese people and stop the anti-imperialist struggle of the people of the world (including the American people who are fiercely struggling).

From a strategic point of view, imperialism and other reactionaries are weak, so we should despise them. Despising the enemy strategically can boost our courage to oppose it and have the confidence to defeat it. At the same time, we must take the enemy seriously and fully estimate their strength tactically, not taking reckless actions against them.

The self-criticism states that we are now in an era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards global victory. No force can stop the comprehensive collapse of imperialism and other reactionaries, and no force can prevent socialism from achieving global victory. The military dictatorship of the right-wing army clique, which acts as the running dog of imperialism to protect its interests in Indonesia, cannot avoid its own collapse. They have been brutally and savagely massacring and torturing tens of thousands of communists and democrats to this day, but this will not stop the people and communists from rising up to resist. On the contrary, all these brutal and savage acts will inevitably arouse the corresponding resistance of the people. Communists will be determined to better serve the people, the revolution, and the party to repay the sacrifices of tens of thousands of comrades.

Indonesian Marxist-Leninists will spare no effort to live up to the expectations of Marxist-Leninists around the world, resolutely defend Marxism-Leninism, oppose modern revisionism, and better work for the liberation of the people and their country, and for the world proletarian revolution.

Indonesian Marxist-Leninists who are united in thought and determined to take the revolutionary path, fully trust the masses, rely on the masses, and work bravely, diligently, cautiously, patiently, perseveringly, and vigilantly, will definitely be able to fulfill their historical mission, lead the people's democratic revolution, smash the military dictatorship of the right-wing army clique, and establish a new power, the people's democratic dictatorship. Relying on the people's democratic dictatorship, which is the joint government of the working class leading all anti-imperialist and anti-feudal classes, the Indonesian people will thoroughly eliminate the remnants of imperialism and feudalism, build a free democratic new society, and move towards a society without exploitation and oppression.

Let us unite and advance along the revolutionary path illuminated by Marxism-Leninism, advance along the path of liberating the Indonesian proletariat and the Indonesian people and leading them towards socialism.

　　印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局的自我批评（摘要）
　　一九六六年九月
    新华社七日讯　今年一月出版的第三期《印度尼西亚论坛》，发表了印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局于一九六六年九月通过的自我批评，题目是《建设马克思列宁主义的印度尼西亚共产党，领导印度尼西亚人民民主革命》。
    自我批评说，九卅运动发生和失败以后，印度尼西亚共产党和印度尼西亚人民革命运动遭到严重损失的灾难，这就揭开了相当长时期以来遮盖着印度尼西亚共产党的严重弱点的帷幕。
    政治局认识到它对党内这个时期以来的严重弱点和错误负有最大责任。因此政治局很关心和最重视来自干部和党员的马克思列宁主义的批评以及来自党的同情者以各种方式提出的诚恳的批评。政治局决心开展马克思列宁主义的自我批评，执行列宁的教导，并且以慕梭同志所进行的马克思列宁主义的批评和自我批评为榜样。
    自我批评说，在目前纳苏蒂安—苏哈托陆军右派将领军事独裁的最野蛮、最残暴的白色恐怖猖獗的情况下，要进行这种全面的批评和自我批评是不容易的。为了解决迫切的需要，有必要先提出思想、政治和组织方面的基本问题，作为在当前整风运动中研究党内的弱点和错误的依据。
    政治局虚心地和诚恳地提出这个自我批评。政治局希望每一个党员采取批判的态度积极地参加讨论党的领导的弱点和错误，根据集体或个人的经验吸取教训，尽一切努力使印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局的这个自我批评完善起来。政治局希望每一个党员坚持“团结——批评——团结”和“惩前毖后、治病救人的方针，借以达到既要弄清思想又要团结同志这样两个目的”。政治局相信，坚持这个正确的方针，每一个党员就会抱着重建马克思列宁主义的印度尼西亚共产党，加强共产党人的统一和团结，提高思想上、政治上和组织上的警惕性，以及提高斗志争取胜利的决心，参加这场研究并克服弱点和错误的运动。
    在思想方面的基本弱点
    自我批评指出，党在一九五一年以来的这个时期内的严重弱点和错误，也不能不根源于思想上的弱点，首先是党的领导。党的领导不但不能把革命的理论同印度尼西亚革命的具体实践结合起来，反而走上了脱离最先进理论的指南的道路。这个经验说明了印度尼西亚共产党还未能形成由无产阶级分子组成的、对马克思列宁主义真正具有最正确的理解、系统的而不是零碎的理解、实际的而不是空洞的理解的领导核心。
    自我批评说，一九五一年以来的这个时期内，主观主义一直在发展，越来越严重，从而产生了右倾机会主义——它与国际共产主义运动中发生的现代修正主义的影响结合起来。这是一条右倾机会主义黑线，它成了印度尼西亚共产党在这个时期内的错误的主要特征。这些弱点和错误之所以滋长和发展有如下几个因素：
    第一，在党内，特别是党领导内部，没有发扬马克思列宁主义的批评和自我批评传统。
    党有的时候开展整风运动或学习运动，这些运动进行得不够严肃和彻底，没有很好地加以总结，必要的组织措施也没有跟上来。这些学习运动更多的是针对着下面，可以说从来不曾针对着领导层，让他们进行批评和自我批评。对来自下面的批评，不是好好地加以引导，而是加以压制。
    第二，由于资产阶级思想影响的渗透，这主要通过以下两条渠道，即在党同民族资产阶级建立统一战线的时候，以及干部特别是领导干部在政府机构或半官方机构任职后他们本身资产阶级化的时候。越来越多的党的干部在中央和地方的政府机构和半官方机构中任职，从而产生了已经“资产阶级化的工人……阶层”，这是“改良主义……的真正传播者”。这种情况在一九四五年八月革命以前是不存在的。
    第三，第五届中央委员会第四次全体会议不加批判地通过了同意苏联共产党第二十次代表大会的路线的报告，并把“通过议会道路、以和平方式达到社会主义”的路线作为印度尼西亚共产党的路线，从这个时候起，现代修正主义就开始渗入党内。在印度尼西亚共产党第六次代表大会上，作为现代修正主义的一个特点的和平道路更加固定下来了，在党章上写了下面一段话：“在印度尼西亚，作为走向社会主义的过渡阶段的人民民主制度通过和平道路、议会道路来实现，这是一种可能性。印度尼西亚共产党竭尽全力为使这种可能性变为现实性而斗争。”这条修正主义路线在第七次全国代表大会上又再次被强调，而且从来没有纠正过，尽管当时我们党已经认识到苏共领导自从二十大以来已经走上现代修正主义的道路。
    自我批评强调说，印度尼西亚共产党的经验教训是：对苏共现代修正主义采取批判的态度并不意味着印度尼西亚共产党本身自然地会避免现代修正主义者所犯的同样的右倾机会主义错误。印度尼西亚共产党的经验教训是：现代修正主义是国际共产主义运动中最大的危险，也是印度尼西亚共产党的最大的危险。现代修正主义不是“潜在的、不尖锐的危险”，而是现实的危险，并且已经给印度尼西亚共产党造成了严重的破坏，给印度尼西亚人民革命运动带来了巨大损失。因此绝不可忽视现代修正主义的危险，必须对它进行毫不留情的斗争。只有在我们党抛弃“同现代修正主义者保持友好”的路线之后，才能有效地以明朗的态度在一切方面反对现代修正主义。
    印度尼西亚共产党一方面批评苏共领导的现代修正主义，但另一方面也犯了修正主义的错误，因为它修正马克思列宁主义关于阶级斗争、国家与革命的学说，这是一个事实。此外，印度尼西亚共产党的领导不但没有象列宁所教导的那样，在理论方面同革命思想中的其他各种会使无产阶级离开正确道路的思潮进行斗争，反而是自愿地作理论上的让步。印度尼西亚共产党领导曾经把马克思主义的三个组成部分（即唯物主义哲学、政治经济学和科学社会主义）和“加诺兄的学说的三个组成部分”相提并论；想要把工人阶级的意识形态马克思主义变成为全民族所有，而在全民族中是存在着与工人阶级相敌对的剥削阶级的。
    在政治方面的基本错误
    自我批评说，我们现在检查在政治方面的右倾机会主义错误包括三个问题：（1）实现印度尼西亚人民民主的道路；（2）国家政权问题；（3）民族统一战线的实施。
    自我批评说，马克思列宁主义和修正主义之间的一个根本区别和矛盾，恰恰就在于达到社会主义道路的问题上。马克思列宁主义教导说，达到社会主义要通过无产阶级革命的道路，而殖民地、半殖民地和半封建的国家如印度尼西亚则要先通过人民民主革命的阶段。而修正主义则幻想通过和平道路达到社会主义。
    自我批评指出，在一九五一年以来的时期的最初几年，党在政治斗争中和党的建设方面取得了一定的成就。这个时期的重要成就是，对印度尼西亚革命的基本问题进行了论述。提到印度尼西亚革命的现阶段是新式的资产阶级民主革命，其任务是消灭帝国主义和封建主义残余并建立人民民主制度，作为社会主义的过渡阶段。革命的动力是工人阶级、农民和小资产阶级，领导力量是工人阶级，主要的群众力量是农民。也提到民族资产阶级是动摇不定的革命力量，在某种程度上和在一定时期内可以站在革命的方面，但在另外的时期内可能背叛革命。党也作出论述说，工人阶级为了能够完成其作为印度尼西亚革命的领导者的任务，必须与其他一切革命的阶级和阶层，在以工人阶级为领导的工农联盟的基础上建立革命的统一战线。
    但是，一个非常重要的而在后来发展成为右倾机会主义或修正主义偏向的缺点是：党在印度尼西亚革命的主要工作和主要斗争形式上还没有达到明确的思想上的一致。
    自我批评指出，中国革命提供了在殖民地、半殖民地和半封建国家进行革命的主要斗争形式的经验，即武装的人民斗争反对武装的反革命。由于革命的实质是土地革命，因此，这种武装的人民斗争的实质是工人阶级领导的、进行土地革命的农民武装斗争。中国革命的实践首先是结合中国具体情况来运用马克思列宁主义。同时，它也提出了殖民地、半殖民地和半封建国家人民的革命的普遍规律。
    自我批评强调，印度尼西亚革命要取得完全的胜利，也必须走中国革命的道路。这就是说，印度尼西亚革命不可避免地必须采取武装的人民斗争反对武装的反革命这一主要的斗争形式，其实质是无产阶级领导下的武装的农民土地革命。
    自我批评说，一切合法的和议会的工作形式必须为主要的斗争形式或活动服务，绝对不可以阻碍武装斗争的成熟过程。
    过去十五年来的经验教训是：从不明确反对和平道路和不坚持殖民地、半殖民地和半封建国家的革命的普遍规律开始，印度尼西亚共产党越来越陷入到议会斗争和其他合法斗争形式中去。党领导竟把这些斗争形式当作达到印度尼西亚革命战略目标的主要斗争形式。党的合法地位不是被看作是在一定时期内和在一定情况下的一种斗争形式，而是被当作原则，其他的斗争形式都必须为这个原则服务。甚至在反革命不但已经剥夺了党的合法地位，而且已经剥夺了共产党人的人权的时候，还想竭力坚持这个“合法地位”。
    自我批评说，从印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会第四次全体会议（一九五六年）通过接受苏共二十大现代修正主义路线的文件时起，“和平道路”就开始在党内定下来了。在修正主义路线已在党内定下来的情况下，党是不可能有正确的马克思列宁主义的战略和策略路线的。党的战略和基本策略路线的提法，最初在“和平道路”或“武装革命道路”的问题上是模糊的，发展到最后则是“和平道路”占了统治地位。
    就是在这种情况下，印度尼西亚共产党在第六次全国代表大会（一九五九年）上提出了它的总路线，即“继续建立民族统一战线和继续党的建设，以实现一九四五年八月革命的要求”。根据党的这条总路线制定了“高举党的三面旗帜”的口号。这就是：（1）民族统一战线的旗帜；（2）党的建设的旗帜；（3）一九四五年八月革命的旗帜。这条总路线被当作是走向印度尼西亚人民民主的道路。
    党的领导力图说明党的三面旗帜是取得人民民主革命胜利的三件主要武器，就象毛泽东同志提出的：“一个有纪律的，有马克思列宁主义的理论武装的，采取自我批评方法的，联系人民群众的党。一个由这样的党领导的军队。一个由这样的党领导的各革命阶级各革命派别的统一战线。”
    第二件主要武器意味着在党的领导下的武装的人民斗争反对武装的反革命。党领导却想把“高举一九四五年八月革命的旗帜”的口号来代替它。
    党领导为了证明它所走的道路不是机会主义的“和平道路”，经常谈到有两种可能性，即和平道路的可能性和非和平道路的可能性；党对非和平道路准备得越好，和平道路的可能性就越大。就这样，经常向党员、工人阶级和劳动人民群众散播实际上不存在的和平道路的希望。
    在实践中，党领导不是使党的整个队伍、工人阶级和人民群众做好准备，以应付非和平道路的可能性。最明显的证据是九卅运动发生和失败以后的最令人痛心的悲剧。反革命在短短的时间内就能够屠杀和逮捕几十万处于被动情况下的共产党人和非党革命人士，并且瘫痪了印度尼西亚共产党组织和革命群众团体。假如党领导没有离开革命道路的话，这种情况就肯定不会发生。
    自我批评说，党领导提出“党不可以抄袭外国武装斗争的理论，而必须采取三种斗争形式相结合的方法，即：农村的游击战争（参加者主要是雇农和贫农）；城市中的工人（主要是运输工人）的革命斗争；在敌人的武装力量中间的有效工作。”党领导批评一些同志，认为他们在学习中国人民的武装斗争经验的时候只看到共同点。与此相反，党领导提出了一些必须加以考虑的不同条件，从而得出这样的结论，即印度尼西亚革命的特殊方法是“三种斗争形式相结合的方法”。
    自我批评说，为了完成艰巨而又光荣的历史任务，即领导反对帝国主义、反对封建主义和反对官僚资本主义的人民革命，印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者必须坚决地抛弃这条修正主义的和平道路，抛弃“三种斗争形式相结合的方法的理论”，高举武装的人民革命的旗帜。同时，正如伟大的中国人民革命的经验那样，印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者必须建立革命根据地；他们“必须把落后的农村造成先进的巩固的根据地，造成军事上、政治上、经济上、文化上的伟大的革命阵地”。
    在处理这个最根本的问题的同时，我们还必须采取其他的斗争形式；如果没有其他斗争形式的配合，武装斗争是不会取得进展的。
    自我批评指出，党领导的右倾机会主义路线也反映在对待国家特别是印度尼西亚共和国国家的态度上。
    根据马克思列宁主义关于国家的学说，在一九四五年八月革命失败以后，印度尼西亚共产党的任务应当是教育印度尼西亚的工人阶级和劳动人民，使他们清楚地了解印度尼西亚共和国国家的阶级性质是资产阶级专政。印度尼西亚共产党应当启发印度尼西亚工人阶级和其他劳动人民的觉悟，使他们了解，他们的解放斗争不可避免地必须走向“通过暴力革命”，由工人阶级领导的人民国家去“代替资产阶级国家”。但是，印度尼西亚共产党的领导执行了机会主义路线，在人民中引起了对资产阶级民主的幻想。
    自我批评说，党领导背离马克思列宁主义的国家学说的错误，在“印度尼西亚共和国政权的两个方面的理论”产生时达到了顶点。
    “两个方面的理论”在国家和国家政权的问题上提出如下的看法：“印度尼西亚共和国的国家政权，作为一个矛盾来看，是互相对抗的两个方面之间的矛盾。第一个方面：代表人民利益（体现在苏加诺总统的进步的态度和政策上，它们得到了印度尼西亚共产党和其他人民阶层的支持）的方面。第二个方面：代表人民的敌人的利益（体现在右派或顽固派的态度和政策上）的方面。人民的方面已经是主要的方面，它在印度尼西亚共和国国家政权内起着领导作用”。
      “两个方面的理论”，明显地是机会主义或修正主义的错误，因为它否定了马克思列宁主义的学说，即国家是一定阶级的统治机关，这个阶级决不能与同它对立的一方（同它对抗的阶级）调和。印度尼西亚共和国不可能由人民和人民的敌人共同统治。
    自我批评说，已经陷入机会主义泥坑的党领导认为，“人民的方面”已经成为主要的方面，并且在印度尼西亚共和国政权内起着领导作用，似乎印度尼西亚人民已经接近于成立人民政权了。同时，由于认为民族资产阶级力量在国家政权内是真正的“人民方面”，因此党领导竭尽全力来维护和发展这个“人民方面”。党领导已经完全把自己溶化到民族资产阶级的利益里去了。
    把民族资产阶级的地位看成是印度尼西亚共和国政权内的人民方面，把苏加诺总统看成是领导，这就意味着认为民族资产阶级能够领导新式的资产阶级民主革命。这是违反历史的必然性和历史事实的。
    印度尼西亚共产党领导说，“两个方面的理论”完全不同于修正主义的意大利共产党领导人的“结构改革论”。但是，不论从理论上或从实践情况来看，这两种“理论”是没有区别的。两者都是从通过和平道路达到社会主义出发，两者都幻想国家结构及其内部力量对比逐渐地改变，两者都同样是拒绝革命的道路，两者都同样是修正主义。
    这个反对革命的“两个方面的理论”明显地表现在下面这个说明中：“印度尼西亚共产党在国家政权方面的斗争是，促使拥护人民的方面日益壮大起来并且能够居于支配地位，而把反人民的力量从国家政权中排除出去。”
    党的领导甚至把这个反对革命的道路称为“从上面和从下面的革命”。从上面的意思是说，印度尼西亚共产党必须推动国家政权去采取革命的措施，以便在人事上以及对国家工具进行改革。而从下面的意思是说，唤起、组织和动员人民来实现上述改革。好一个异想天开的幻想！党的领导不从下面这种事实中学习：苏加诺总统关于成立互助合作内阁（旧式的民族联合政府）的方案公布以来已经八年了，尽管不断地提出要求，从未有过而且毫无迹象它会付诸实施，更不用说国家政权的改变了！
    自我批评强调，为了洗清机会主义的污泥，我们的党必须抛掉“国家政权的两个方面的理论”，并且重新确立马克思列宁主义关于国家与革命的学说。
    自我批评说，党的第五次全国代表大会基本上从理论上解决了民族统一战线的问题，并且作出了关于工农联盟是民族统一战线基础的规定。关于民族资产阶级，根据八月革命的经验，已经吸取了教训：这个阶级的态度是动摇的。在某种情况下，民族资产阶级参加和拥护革命，而在另外的情况下，则跟随买办资产阶级打击革命的动力和背叛革命（茉莉芬挑衅事件以及同意圆桌会议协定）。根据民族资产阶级的这个动摇态度，印度尼西亚共产党规定了必须采取的态度，即必须始终努力争取民族资产阶级到革命中来，但也必须提防民族资产阶级可能背叛革命。印度尼西亚共产党必须对民族资产阶级采取又团结又斗争的政策。
    尽管如此，由于党内特别是党的领导的主观主义思想弱点还未完全克服，因而我们的党越来越深地陷入到错误中去，以至于党在同民族资产阶级的统一战线中终于丧失了独立性。这个错误使党和无产阶级成为民族资产阶级的附属品。
    自我批评说，党在同民族资产阶级的统一战线中丧失独立性的一个表现，是在党的领导对待加诺兄的态度和评价的问题上。党的领导对待加诺兄不是持独立的态度，而是回避矛盾，总是突出党同加诺兄的共同点和团结。人民所看到的是，加诺兄的政策没有一项是得不到印度尼西亚共产党支持的。党的领导甚至不经过斗争就承认加诺兄是革命伟大领袖和印度尼西亚共和国政权内的“人民方面”的领袖。党的领导在许多文章和讲话中都表示，印度尼西亚共产党的一切行动，除了以马克思列宁主义为基础之外，也以“加诺兄的学说”为基础，声称印度尼西亚共产党得到迅速发展是由于实行了加诺兄的“纳沙贡”团结的思想，甚至说印度尼西亚人民民主制度的概念符合加诺兄在《建国五原则的诞生》（一九四五年六月一日）讲话中的基本思想。
    自我批评批判了“坚决地执行《政治宣言》就等于执行印度尼西亚共产党纲领”的错误，指出，声称坚决贯彻《政治宣言》等于贯彻印度尼西亚共产党纲领的说法，意味着不是资产阶级接受了印度尼西亚共产党纲领，而是印度尼西亚共产党接受了民族资产阶级的纲领，并且以它来代替了印度尼西亚共产党纲领。
    自我批评说，同民族资产阶级搞统一战线而牺牲原则，这种情况由于提出所谓的“印度尼西亚革命的总路线”有了进一步发展。这条总路线规定“通过以工农为支柱，以‘纳沙贡’为核心，以建国五原则理想为基础的民族统一战线，完成民族民主革命，走向印度尼西亚社会主义”。这条所谓“印度尼西亚革命的总路线”完全没有革命的味道。因为取得革命胜利的三个条件，即强大的马克思列宁主义的党、党领导下的武装的人民斗争和民族统一战线，只剩下了民族统一战线。而且这也已经不是革命的民族统一战线了，因为它不是以工人阶级领导下的工农联盟为基础，而是以“纳沙贡”为基础。
    党的领导说，“以‘纳沙贡’为核心的民族互助合作”口号“不可能模糊民族统一战线的阶级内容”。这个说法不对。“纳沙贡”的阶级内容就是工人阶级、民族资产阶级，甚至有买办分子、官僚资本家和地主。显然，把“纳沙贡”作为核心，不但模糊了民族统一战线的阶级内容，而且把革命的民族统一战线的含义完全改变为工人阶级同所有的阶级包括反动阶级的联盟，或者变为阶级合作。
    这个错误必须纠正。党必须抛弃那条错误的“印度尼西亚革命的总路线”，必须回到正确的方案上来，即回到以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的革命的民族统一战线上来。
    自我批评说，同民族资产阶级搞统一战线而牺牲原则，这种情况之所以发生也是由于党没有正确地对具体情况进行具体分析。
    自我批评指出，一九四五年八月革命失败以后，除西伊里安以外，帝国主义者在印度尼西亚并不直接掌握政权。印度尼西亚的政权掌握在那些代表帝国主义和封建主义残余利益的买办阶级和地主手里。印度尼西亚也不是正处在帝国主义侵犯的情况下。在这种情况下，如果印度尼西亚共产党不犯政治上的错误，那么当权的各个反动阶级同人民之间的矛盾就会尖锐化，并将成为印度尼西亚的主要矛盾。印度尼西亚革命的首要任务是推翻国内各个反动阶级的统治；它们也是代表帝国主义特别是美帝国主义的利益。只有这条道路才能真正地推翻帝国主义和封建主义残余。
    纠正党在同民族资产阶级的统一战线中的错误并不意味着党现在就不需要团结这个阶级。党必须以工人阶级领导下的工农联盟为基础，努力争取民族资产阶级站到革命方面来。
    在组织方面的主要错误
    自我批评说，在党内占统治地位的错误的政治路线不能不带来错误的组织路线。错误的政治路线在党内占统治地位越久越深，组织方面的错误就越大，造成的损失也越大。一九五一年以后的时期内，党的错误政治路线是右倾机会主义，在组织方面随着而来的也是右倾，即自由主义和合法主义。
    组织方面的自由主义路线表现在这种倾向：把印度尼西亚共产党变为一个拥有最多党员的党，一个松弛的组织，一个称为群众的党。
    自我批评说，党的群众性首先不是表现在党员的人数众多，而是首先表现在它与群众的紧密联系，表现在它维护人民群众利益的政治路线，或者是表现在它贯彻了群众路线。只有党坚持其先锋队的条件时，只有党是由无产阶级中优秀的分子组成并以马克思列宁主义理论武装起来时，党才能坚持它的群众路线。因此，建设具有群众性的马克思列宁主义党不可能不着重进行马克思列宁主义教育。
    自我批评指出，近几年来，印度尼西亚共产党执行了违背马克思列宁主义组织原则的建党路线。
    自我批评说，自由主义地发展党员，是同争取和平道路的政治路线分不开的。用人数众多的党员来达到扩大党在同民族资产阶级的统一战线中的影响的目的。而通过越来越大的党和继续团结民族资产阶级，就可以造成有可能完全打败顽固势力的力量对比。
    所重视的不再是教育和训练马克思列宁主义的干部，以便进行革命的准备，以便在农民中间工作和建立革命根据地，而是教育知识分子，以便适应同民族资产阶级搞统一战线工作的需要，以便担任由于这种合作而在国家机构中取得的一些职位。“全面地同农民结合”的口号变成纯粹的空谈。所实行的不是把最优秀的干部派到农村去，而是把干部从农村调到城市来，从地方调到中央来。
    为了让资产阶级看得起和尊重党，把党看成是有学问的人的党，因此四年计划中规定党的所有高级干部必须完成学院级的教育，党的中级干部完成高中教育，党的下层干部则完成初中教育。为了这一需要而成立了许多院校和训练班。知识分子主义已经这样深入地影响了党的领导，以至于所有党的领导人和人民运动的领导人都被责成写四篇论文以获取马克思主义学者的称号。
    党在右倾机会主义或修正主义的泥潭里陷得越深，就越丧失组织上的警惕性，而合法主义却在组织内发展了。党的领导对资产阶级民主的虚伪性丧失了阶级警惕性。党的一切活动表现出似乎和平道路是非常肯定的。党的领导没有就反动派不断伺机进行攻击的危险在党员群众中唤起警惕。正是由于这种组织上的合法主义，所以反革命能在短时间内使印度尼西亚共产党的组织陷于瘫痪。
    组织上的自由主义破坏了党内的民主原则，破坏了集体领导，滋长了个人领导和权力，滋长了自治主义。
    在自由主义统治的党的组织路线的情况下，不可能贯彻党的工作作风，即“理论和实践相结合，密切联系群众和进行自我批评”。也不可能贯彻以领导和群众相结合为核心的领导方法，这个方法是要上级为下级作出榜样的。
    自我批评指出，党内占统治地位的错误的政治路线所带来的组织上的错误路线破坏了马克思列宁主义党的原则，破坏了党的组织基础即民主集中制，也破坏了党的工作作风和领导方法。
    自我批评强调指出，为了把印度尼西亚共产党建设成为马克思列宁主义的党，必须彻底揭露组织上的自由主义以及产生自由主义的思想根源。必须把印度尼西亚共产党重新建设成为一个列宁式的党，建设成为一个能够履行作为印度尼西亚无产阶级的先进部队和最高组织形式的任务的党，建设成为一个能够承担领导印度尼西亚人民群众赢得反帝反封建反官僚资本主义革命的胜利、从而走向社会主义的历史任务的党。这样的党必须具备如下的条件：思想上，用马克思列宁主义理论武装起来，摆脱主观主义、机会主义和现代修正主义；政治上，具有正确的纲领，包括革命的土地纲领，掌握印度尼西亚革命的战略和策略问题——掌握主要的斗争形式，即在无产阶级领导下的农民武装斗争，以及掌握其他斗争形式，善于建立一个以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础包括各个反帝反封建的阶级和阶层的革命的统一战线；组织上，在人民群众中具有扎实和深厚的基础，由可靠的、有经验的和经过考验的党员组成，在执行民族任务中成为模范。
    目前我们是在最残暴、最野蛮的反革命恐怖政权的统治下重新建党。党的合法地位和共产党人的人权已经被剥夺殆尽。因此党必须完全以非法的方式进行组织和工作。在完全以非法的方式进行工作时，党必须善于根据情况充分利用一切可能的机会去进行合法的活动，运用群众能够接受的方式去发动并领导群众斗争，把它逐步提高到更高阶段。
    自我批评强调，在重建马克思列宁主义的印度尼西亚共产党时，必须把最大的注意力放在农村的建党工作和建立革命根据地的工作上。
    上述重建马克思列宁主义的印度尼西亚共产党的任务是艰巨的、充满危险的和长期的，因此必须勇敢地、勤奋地、谨慎地、耐心地和坚韧地去进行。
    出路
    自我批评说，了解了上面所说的党自一九五一年以来的弱点和错误以后，印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者目前所面临的紧迫任务就十分清楚了。这就是：
    第一，重新把印度尼西亚共产党建设成为摆脱了主观主义、机会主义和现代修正主义的马克思列宁主义的党。
    为了重建这样的马克思列宁主义党，各级党的干部和党员对党过去所犯的错误以及今后所必须采取的新道路应该取得统一认识。
    为了达到统一认识，必须在全党进行整风运动。我们打算通过整风运动改变过去的错误思想，树立正确的思想。要走上正确的道路就绝对必须抛弃错误的道路。
    在目前的形势下，要对过去的包括细节问题的全部错误取得统一认识是不容易的。但是对于象这个自我批评中所阐述的主要问题，统一认识却是绝对必要的。
    自我批评说，我们今天所纠正的党在政治上和组织上的机会主义和修正主义的错误，不但是最近十年来的社会和历史条件的产物，而且还有更深远的根源，即我们党成立以来的社会和历史条件。因此，决不要以为进行了这个批评与自我批评以后，问题就解决了。只要主观主义的思想还未从党内清算掉，尤其是在党的领导中还存在着主观主义，党就不能避免右的或“左”的机会主义错误，因为党不可能正确地分析政治形势，也不可能作出正确的工作指示。以全副精力向主观主义作战，是中央领导和干部以及地方各级领导和干部的首要义务。
    只有全党提高了区别无产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想的能力，并开展批评与自我批评，才能有效地反对和清除主观主义。只有加强马克思列宁主义教育，才能提高全党区别无产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想的能力。党必须教育党员运用马克思列宁主义的方法去分析政治形势和估计阶级力量，避免做主观主义的分析和估计。党必须促使党员注意调查和研究社会和经济情况，以便能够制定出斗争策略和工作方法；必须帮助党员认识，不调查实际情况，他们就会陷入幻想。
    自我批评强调指出，党在过去各个时期中的斗争经验表明，对于决心捍卫马克思列宁主义和反对现代修正主义的印度尼西亚马克思列宁主义者，学习马克思、恩格斯、列宁和斯大林的学说，特别是学习毛泽东思想，具有非常重要的意义。毛泽东同志光辉地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义发展到当代的顶峰。
    只有采取明确的态度反对目前以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义，印度尼西亚共产党才能高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜。反对现代修正主义不可能同时又与现代修正主义者保持友好。印度尼西亚共产党必须抛弃过去同现代修正主义的关系的错误态度。只有采取毫不留情的态度反对现代修正主义，才能体现出对无产阶级国际主义的忠诚，因为现代修正主义破坏无产阶级国际主义，背叛无产阶级和全世界被压迫人民的斗争。
    在重新建党时，印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者必须注意创造领导武装的农民土地革命的条件，这将是赢得印度尼西亚人民民主革命胜利的主要斗争形式。这就是说，必须把最大的注意力放在重建农村党组织上面。必须以最大的注意力去解决在反封建的土地革命中唤起、组织和动员农民的问题。必须真正地实现党和农民，特别是和雇农、贫农的结合。因为只有通过这种结合，党才有可能领导农民，而农民才能够成为人民民主革命的不可战胜的堡垒。
    由于第三次白色恐怖的打击，结果党在农村中的组织普遍遭到更严重的破坏，从而在农村工作更加困难和吃力。但是这并不改变农民是印度尼西亚人民民主革命的主要力量以及农村是它的根据地这一规律的正确性。只要印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者下定决心，一切为人民群众，就一定能够克服这些严重的困难。只要印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者充分相信群众，依靠群众，就一定能够把落后的印度尼西亚农村改变成为军事上、政治上和文化上强大的巩固的革命堡垒。
    印度尼西亚的农民最关心人民民主革命。因为只有这个革命才能够把他们从封建压迫造成的落后和极不合理的生活中解放出来。只有这个革命才能使农民得到他们一辈子所渴望的赖以为生的土地。因此不管多么艰难曲折，农民为了土地和自由一定走革命的道路。
    显然，印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者当前的第二项任务，是创造以无产阶级为领导的武装的农民土地革命所必需的条件。如果印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者能够唤起、组织和动员农民进行反封建的土地革命，那么工人阶级在人民民主革命中的领导权就有了保证，胜利也有了保证。
    虽然如此，党仍然必须努力同其他反帝反封建的阶级和阶层建立革命的统一战线。在工人阶级领导的工农联盟的基础上，党必须努力争取城市小资产阶级和其他民主人士，也必须争取民族资产阶级作为人民民主革命的后备同盟军。目前的客观条件有可能建立起广泛的革命统一战线。
    纳苏蒂安—苏哈托陆军右派将领军事专政只不过是国内最反动的阶级，即买办资产阶级、官僚资本家和地主政权的体现。以陆军右派将领集团为首的国内反动阶级对人民实行专政，充当保护帝国主义特别是美帝国主义在印度尼西亚的利益的走狗。因而在他们的统治下，帝国主义和封建主义对印度尼西亚人民的压迫和剥削必然变本加厉。
    陆军右派将领军事专政只代表为数极小的少数人的利益而压迫绝大多数的印度尼西亚人民。因此陆军右派将领军事专政必然遭到广大人民群众的反抗。
    因此，印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者的第三项紧迫任务，是同各个反帝和反封建的阶级和阶层建立以工人阶级为领导的、以工农联盟为基础的革命统一战线。
    显然，为了赢得人民民主革命的胜利，印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者必须高举党的三面旗帜。
    第一面旗帜，建设摆脱主观主义、机会主义和现代修正主义的马克思列宁主义党。
    第二面旗帜，进行人民武装斗争，其实质是工人阶级领导的武装农民反对封建主义的土地革命斗争。
    第三面旗帜，建立以工人阶级为领导、以工农联盟为基础的革命统一战线。
    印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者所面临的任务是非常艰巨的。他们必须在史无前例的最野蛮最残暴的恐怖的迫害下进行工作。但是，印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者毫不怀疑地认为，在纠正了党的过去的错误以后，他们现在正走上正确的道路，人民民主革命的道路。不论这条道路是多么漫长、曲折和困难，但这是走向自由、民主的新印度尼西亚——真正属于印度尼西亚人民的印度尼西亚的唯一道路。为此，必须敢于走漫长的道路。
    自我批评指出，印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者和革命者根据本身的斗争经验，毫不怀疑毛泽东同志的下述论点的正确性，即帝国主义和反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，他们的样子是可怕的，但是实际上他们是虚弱的。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的是人民。现在当权的陆军右派将领军事专政也是纸老虎。他们的样子看起来是强大而又可怕。但实际上他们是虚弱的，因为他们得不到人民的支持，反而为人民所反对；他们本身内部充满了矛盾，互相争权夺利。帝国主义者，特别是陆军右派将领军事专政所依靠的美帝国主义者也是纸老虎。他们的样子看起来是强大而又可怕，但实际上他们是虚弱的并且正在走向崩溃。帝国主义，特别是美帝国主义的弱点表现在他们征服不了英勇的越南人民，阻挡不了全世界人民（包括正在猛烈搏斗中的美国人民）反帝斗争的浪潮。
    从战略上看，帝国主义和其他反动派是虚弱的，因此我们应当藐视它们。从战略上藐视敌人就能鼓起勇气去反对它，就有信心去战胜它。同时，我们应当重视敌人，在战术上充分估计它们的力量，对它们不采取冒险的行动。
    自我批评说，我们现在正处于帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代，没有任何力量能够制止帝国主义和其他反动派的全面崩溃，没有任何力量能够阻止社会主义在全世界取得胜利。充当帝国主义的走狗去保护它在印度尼西亚的利益的陆军右派将领军事专政，也不能避免他们本身的崩溃。他们至今仍在对几十万共产党人和民主人士进行残暴野蛮的屠杀和虐待，但是，这也阻止不了人民和共产党人起来进行反抗。相反，这一切残暴野蛮的行为必然激起人民的相应反抗。共产党人将下定决心，更好地为人民、为革命和为党服务，来报答几十万同志所作出的牺牲。
    印度尼西亚的马克思列宁主义者必将全力以赴，不辜负全世界马克思列宁主义者的重望，坚决捍卫马克思列宁主义，反对现代修正主义，为解放人民和他们的国家，为世界无产阶级革命而更好地工作。
    思想上团结一致和决心走革命道路的印度尼西亚马克思列宁主义者，充分信任群众，依靠群众，勇敢地、勤奋地、谨慎地、耐心地、坚韧地和警惕地工作，就一定能够完成其历史使命，领导人民民主革命，粉碎陆军右派将领军事专政，建立崭新的政权即人民民主专政。依靠人民民主专政，即工人阶级领导的，包括各个反帝反封建的阶级的共同政权，印度尼西亚人民将彻底消灭帝国主义和封建主义残余，建设自由民主的新社会，走向没有人剥削人和人压迫人的社会主义。
    让我们团结起来，朝着马克思列宁主义学说照亮了的革命道路前进，朝着解放印度尼西亚无产阶级和印度尼西亚人民并引导他们走向社会主义的道路前进。
