The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dongfeng Brigade in Dongzha Commune, Jiaxing County, Zhejiang Province, have since April been linking the history of the struggle between the two lines in their commune and brigade to angrily denounce and criticize the heinous crimes of the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road in severely reducing the number of cooperatives and sabotaging the agricultural cooperative movement. Through the great criticism of the revolution, the broad masses of commune members have further seen through the evil plot of this Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism, and have resolved to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to eradicate all the poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, and to steadfastly advance along the socialist road indicated by Chairman Mao.

In his article "On the Question of Agricultural Cooperativization," Chairman Mao pointed out: "In Zhejiang, because of the adoption of the so-called 'resolute contraction' policy (not decided by the Zhejiang Provincial Party Committee), out of 53,000 cooperatives, 15,000, including 400,000 farm households, were dissolved, causing great discontent among the masses and cadres, which is very inappropriate." Now, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Zhejiang have a clearer understanding that this Chinese Khrushchev was the chief culprit who, in 1955, carried out the "resolute contraction" nationwide and severely reduced the number of cooperatives.

In the spring of 1955, under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, the agricultural cooperativization movement in Jiaxing County developed rapidly, with 1,680 agricultural cooperatives established throughout the county. It was at this time that the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road, through his henchmen, sent a work team to Jiaxing County for an "investigation." As soon as they arrived in Jiaxing, they, according to the will of the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road, seized on individual shortcomings in the cooperativization movement, slandered it, and spread a "black wind" of reducing the number of cooperatives. Dongfeng Brigade had already established 13 cooperatives. Under the heavy pressure of the "black wind" of reducing the number of cooperatives by the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road, two cooperatives firmly resisted and were not dissolved, while the rest were forcibly dissolved. The number of households that had joined the cooperatives decreased from 311 to over 60.

For more than a decade, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Dongfeng Brigade have always remembered the account of the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road in reducing the number of cooperatives. After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, was launched, this top party person in authority taking the capitalist road was exposed. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants here were filled with both old and new grievances, and through big and small meetings, they denounced and criticized in both speech and writing the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road for his heinous crimes of attempting to restore capitalism.

In the course of denouncing and criticizing, many poor and lower-middle peasants recalled the situation at the time of reducing the number of cooperatives and said: When we were joyfully establishing cooperatives, shaking off the poverty of individual farming, and beginning to walk the road to happiness, the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road wielded the axe and chopped down our cooperatives. This was like cutting flesh from our bodies. Many cadres and poor and lower-middle peasants could not eat or sleep well upon hearing the news. Some wept bitterly and did not want to disband. At that time, we thought, this could not be Chairman Mao's order. Chairman Mao knew best that we poor and lower-middle peasants wanted to take the socialist road and would not order us to disband. Only those who stood on the side of the landlords and capitalists, scheming for them, could do such a bad thing that harmed the interests of the poor and lower-middle peasants. Now it is clear that it was the Chinese Khrushchev who was behind it all!

The 19th Team of Dongfeng Brigade, former members of the Qili Shop Cooperative, used the facts of competition between individual farming and collective farming in their team after the reduction of cooperatives to refute the absurd proposal of the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road to develop the economy of rich peasants, proving that the road of individual farming in the style of "three horses, one plow, and one cart" is a dead end. This team originally had a primary cooperative of 18 households. Under the poisonous influence of the "black wind" of reducing the number of cooperatives, some well-off farmers withdrew first, and finally only nine poor and lower-middle peasants persisted in running the cooperative. Relying on collective strength, they had a bumper harvest that year, completed the state's grain procurement task, ensured the food ration for the commune members, and sold more than 10,000 jin of surplus grain to the state. The nine households that withdrew, each going their own way, had better conditions but could not match the production of the cooperative, could not complete the state's grain procurement task, and even had problems with their food rations.

Many poor and lower-middle peasants recalled the hardships they suffered before liberation and the benefits brought by the collective economy after liberation, and expressed their determination not to let the Chinese Khrushchev's plot to restore capitalism succeed. Yuan Yunbao, a poor female commune member who had worked as a servant in a landlord's house for ten years, said: "The disasters we poor and lower-middle peasants suffered in the old society are indescribable in three days and three nights. I hate the landlords and capitalists to the core, but the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road whitewashed these bloodsuckers and parasites, saying they 'deserved credit for exploitation.' This is simply turning black into white and talking nonsense!" Yuan Yunbao said: "The road of collectivization is truly 'eating sugarcane, sweet node by node, climbing stairs, step by step higher.' The top party person in authority taking the capitalist road severely reduced the number of cooperatives, advocated the 'four freedoms,' proposed the 'three autonomies and one contract,' restored capitalism, and wanted the landlords and rich peasants to ride on our heads again, making us poor and lower-middle peasants suffer twice. This is a pipe dream, a foolish fantasy."

Through the great denunciation and criticism of the top party person in authority taking the capitalist road, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Dongfeng Brigade have clearly recognized that since liberation, every time a "black wind" or "evil wave" has swept through the countryside, it has been the Chinese Khrushchev who was behind it. The poor and lower-middle peasants have overcome black winds and evil waves on the socialist collectivization road and achieved victories, all thanks to Chairman Mao's wise leadership and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They say: The struggle between the two lines in the countryside is still a long, complex, and tortuous one. We are determined to read Chairman Mao's books for life, to listen to Chairman Mao's words for life, to take class struggle as the key link, and to steadfastly advance along the socialist road.

    东风大队贫下中农心头涌起新仇旧恨
    愤怒控诉中国赫鲁晓夫大砍合作社的罪行
    本报讯　浙江嘉兴县东栅公社东风大队贫下中农从四月份以来，结合本社队的两条道路斗争的历史，愤怒控诉和批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派大砍合作社、破坏农业合作化运动的滔天罪行。广大社员在革命的大批判中，进一步认清这个中国的赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋，决心更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，铲除中国的赫鲁晓夫散布的一切流毒，坚定不移地沿着毛主席指引的社会主义道路奋勇前进。
    毛主席在《关于农业合作化问题》一文中指出：“浙江由于采取所谓‘坚决收缩’的方针（不是浙江省委决定的），一下子就从五万三千个合作社中解散了一万五千个包括四十万农户的合作社，引起群众和干部的很大不满，这是很不妥当的。”现在，浙江广大贫下中农更清楚地知道，这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，正是一九五五年在全国大搞“坚决收缩”，大砍合作社的罪魁祸首。
    一九五五年春天，在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，嘉兴县农业合作化运动迅速发展，全县办起了一千六百八十多个农业合作社。就在这个时候，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，通过他的爪牙，派了工作组到嘉兴县进行“调查”。他们一到嘉兴，就根据党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的意旨，抓住合作化运动中的个别缺点，大肆诬蔑，大刮砍社“黑风”。东风大队已经办起了十三个合作社，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派砍社阴风的重重压力下，除两个社坚决顶住没有解散以外，其余都被强制砍掉了。入社户数从三百十一户减少到六十多户。
    十多年来，东风大队贫下中农一直记住党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派砍合作社的这笔账。毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命开展以后，揪出了这个最大的走资本主义道路当权派。这里的广大贫下中农新仇旧恨一齐涌上心头，通过大会小会，口诛笔伐，揭发和批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派复辟资本主义的滔天罪行。
    在揭发和批判中，很多贫下中农回顾当时砍合作社的情况说：当我们欢天喜地办起合作社，摆脱单干贫困，开始走上幸福道路的时候，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派抡起板斧，砍我们的合作社。这好象割我们身上的肉一样的痛。许多干部和贫下中农得到消息，饭吃不好，觉睡不好，有的痛哭流涕，不愿散伙。当时就想，这决不会是毛主席的命令，毛主席最了解我们贫下中农是要走社会主义道路的，决不会叫我们散伙。只有站在地主、资本家的立场上，拚命为他们打算的人，才会干出这种损害贫下中农利益的坏事来。现在弄清楚了，原来是中国的赫鲁晓夫搞的鬼！
    东风大队第十九队、原七里店合作社社员，在大批判中，用砍社后他们队里单干和集体比赛的事实，驳斥了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派发展富农经济的荒谬主张，证明“三马一犁一车”式的单干道路是走不通的。这个队原来有一个十八户人家的初级社，在砍社黑风的毒害下，有些富裕农民首先退出去，最后只剩下九户贫下中农坚持办社。他们依靠集体力量，这一年生产获得了大丰收，完成了国家粮食征购任务，留足了社员口粮，还多卖了一万多斤余粮给国家。退出去的九户，单枪匹马，各奔前程，条件好而产量却赶不上合作社，国家征购任务完不成，口粮也成问题。
    许多贫下中农回忆了解放前受的苦，解放后集体经济带来的好处，表示坚决不能让中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的阴谋得逞。在地主家当过十年佣人的贫农女社员袁云宝说：“我们贫下中农在旧社会的灾难，三天三夜也说不完。我恨透了地主、资本家，可是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却为这些吸血鬼、害人虫涂脂抹粉，说他们‘剥削有功’。这简直是颠倒黑白，胡说八道！”袁云宝说：“集体化道路真是‘吃甘蔗，节节甜，上楼梯，步步高’。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派大砍合作社，提倡‘四大自由’，主张‘三自一包’，复辟资本主义，想让地主富农重新骑到我们头上，要我们贫下中农吃二遍苦，这是白日做梦，痴心妄想。”
    东风大队广大贫下中农通过对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大揭发大批判，清楚地认识到，解放以来，每次农村中刮黑风，掀恶浪，都是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫搞的鬼。贫下中农在社会主义集体化道路上，每战胜一次黑风恶浪，取得胜利，都是靠毛主席的英明领导，靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他们说：农村中两条道路的斗争还是长期、复杂、曲折的。我们决心读一辈子毛主席的书，听一辈子毛主席的话，以阶级斗争为纲，坚定不移地走社会主义的道路。
