Our Great Harvest, the Soviet Revisionists Are Worried

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has promoted a leap in the development of social productive forces. Now, the agricultural front is reporting victories: this summer's grain harvest is again a bumper crop. This is a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought! This is a rich fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Our dual victories in revolution and production have caused the Soviet revisionist leadership to be extremely terrified. To deceive the people, they have recently resorted to their usual tricks, using their mouthpiece, the Moscow Radio, to distort facts and spread lies. They claim that "due to the Cultural Revolution in China, grain is in severe shortage," "since this spring, more than half of China's farmland has not been cultivated," "China's agricultural output this year will be greatly reduced," "in many places, the grain ration has been reduced again," and so on. The lackey works hard, the master is pleased. The infamous Associated Press immediately relayed this "Arabian Nights" tale of the 1960s.

Lenin once said: "Blowing one's own trumpet and lying are the moral ruin that inevitably leads to political ruin." Brezhnev, Kosygin, and the like are a bunch of morally and politically doomed thieves.

As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepens, our industrial and agricultural production continues to develop. After last year's bumper agricultural harvest, under Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution, promote production," our broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have again achieved this year's summer bumper harvest. It is estimated that this summer's grain output will again see a significant increase compared to last year. So, gentlemen of the Soviet revisionists, you claim that "since this spring, more than half of China's farmland has not been cultivated," then how did this summer's bumper harvest come about? The facts give the Soviet revisionist clique a resounding slap in the face. Every grain stack on our land is a fist striking the liars, and every grain of wheat is a bullet aimed at the slanderers.

Due to the dual victories in revolution and production, the situation on China's grain front is better than ever. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and the revolutionary workers on the grain front are resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's instructions of "being prepared for war, prepared for famine, and serving the people," and the principle of "considering the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual." They have overfulfilled the grain procurement plan for the 1966-1967 fiscal year. The bumper grain harvest, along with the increased production of vegetables, fruits, and meat, has made the lives of the Chinese people better and better. Faced with these ironclad facts, the Soviet revisionist clique claims that "China's agricultural output this year will be greatly reduced" and "in many places, the grain ration has been reduced again." How absurd and laughable!

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has opened up boundless prospects for China's grain production. The facts of the bumper harvest eloquently prove the great truth of Mao Zedong Thought: "Among all things in the world, people are the most precious. Under the leadership of the Communist Party, as long as there are people, any miracle in the world can be created;" "revolution plus production can solve the problem of eating;" "the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a powerful driving force for the development of social productive forces in our country." Through the Cultural Revolution, the broad masses have accepted more Mao Zedong Thought and transformed it into a great material force, pushing China's social productive forces to a higher level.

The Soviet revisionist leadership, facing China's mountains of grain and seas of wheat, dares to lie. This is out of their political needs. They are frantically restoring capitalism at home, causing socialist agriculture to suffer cruel destruction. The situation of grain production and supply is "getting worse every year." This bunch of wastrels has eaten up all the grain reserves accumulated during Stalin's time and now has to line up in the Western market to sell gold to import wheat to live. The working people of the Soviet Union see this clearly and remember it deeply. Therefore, the Soviet revisionist clique not only fears China's bumper harvest but also fears the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that has caused this bumper harvest. In their desperate struggle, the Soviet revisionists fabricate rumors, trying to deceive people and boost their own morale.

Clouds cannot block the sun, and rumors cannot replace bread. The howling of the Soviet revisionist clowns cannot erase the glorious victories of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, nor can it hide their own desperate situation. Even the Soviet Minister of Agriculture Matskevich and the Director of the Grain Administration Khoroshilov have to admit that their "agricultural development speed has greatly declined, and the seven-year plan tasks have not been completed," "in the past seven years, the grain problem has not been solved at all, so now there is still a severe shortage of grain, which cannot meet the urgent needs of our country." The past is not good, will the future be better? On April 9, Khoroshilov again blew the wind and created public opinion in the "Pravda." He attributed the serious political causes to natural disasters, complaining about the bad weather in the spring. He asked the peasants to tighten their belts again to "overcome difficulties."

Belts can be temporarily tightened, but difficulties can never be overcome. The destruction of collective agriculture and the decline in agricultural yields are the inevitable consequences of the restoration of capitalism. Now in the Soviet Union, state farms and collective farms are desolate and bleak; while speculation, free markets are bustling and extremely busy. The "Soviet Russia" newspaper recently revealed that as an important food, potatoes in the distribution plan of Russia, state farms only completed 85%, collective farms only completed 74%. The "Eastern Truth" newspaper of Uzbekistan recently also admitted: "The amount of vegetables, potatoes, fruits, and grapes supplied by collective farms and state farms to residents is very small." While the free market is another world. According to the official "Statistical Bulletin" of the Soviet revisionists, the first issue of this year obviously shows a significantly reduced number, indicating that there are more than 7,200 registered farm markets, with an average of more than 1.7 million people doing business every month. In some regions, the vegetables sold in the free market account for 70% of the total, potatoes account for 80%, eggs account for half, and meat accounts for 40%. The prices in the free market are much higher than the official prices. Due to the full restoration of capitalism, under the layer-by-layer exploitation of big and small vampires, the lives of the Soviet working people are getting worse and worse. "Let there be some vegetables on the table of the working people!" has become a prominent headline in Soviet publications. However, grain and vegetables cannot be called for, only through revolution, overthrowing this bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists, can the Soviet people be liberated again.

### 我国大丰收　苏修大发愁

　　我国大丰收　苏修大发愁
　　中华人民共和国粮食部“粮食公社”
    我国无产阶级文化大革命，促进社会生产力的飞跃发展。如今，农业战线捷报频传：今年夏粮又获大丰收。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！这是无产阶级文化大革命的丰硕成果！
    我国革命与生产的双胜利，引起苏修领导集团的无比恐惧。为了掩盖人们的耳目，最近他们又耍起惯用伎俩，通过其喉舌莫斯科广播电台颠倒黑白，大肆造谣。胡说什么，“由于中国文化大革命，中国粮食十分缺乏”，“自今春以来，中国有半数以上的农田没有耕种”，“中国今年农产量将大大削减”，“在许多地方，粮食配给量已再次下降”，等等。奴才卖力，主子欣赏。臭名昭著的美联社，当天就转发了这则二十世纪六十年代的“天方夜谈”。
    列宁曾说过：“吹牛撒谎是道义上的灭亡，它势必引向政治上的灭亡。”勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流，就是一小撮在道义上、政治上都已走向灭亡的鼠窃狗偷之辈。
    随着无产阶级文化大革命的逐步深入，我国工农业生产不断发展。在去年农业大丰收之后，我国广大贫下中农，在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召下，又夺得了今年的夏季大丰收。预计今年夏粮产量比起去年又有大幅度的增长。试问苏修的老爷们，你们说“自今春以来，中国有半数以上的农田没有耕种”，那末这个夏季大丰收，难道是从天上掉下来的吗？无情的事实给苏修集团一记响亮的耳光。我们国土上的每个粮垛都是直捣造谣者的拳头，每颗麦粒都是射向诬蔑者的子弹。
    由于革命、生产的双胜利，我国粮食战线的形势空前大好。广大贫下中农与粮食战线上的革命职工，坚决贯彻毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的指示，实行“兼顾国家利益、集体利益和个人利益”的原则，使一九六六年到一九六七年的粮食年度征购计划超额完成。粮食的大丰收，再加上蔬菜、水果、肉类的增产，我国人民生活越过越好。面对这些铁的事实，苏修集团却胡说“中国今年农产量将大大削减”，“在许多地方，粮食配给量已再次下降”。多么荒唐可笑！
    无产阶级文化大革命，为我国的粮食生产开辟了无限广阔的前景。大丰收的事实，雄辩地说明了毛泽东思想的伟大真理：“世间一切事物中，人是第一个可宝贵的。在共产党领导下，只要有了人，什么人间奇迹也可以造出来”；“革命加生产即能解决吃饭问题”；“无产阶级文化大革命是使我国社会生产力发展的一个强大的推动力。”通过文化大革命，广大群众接受了更多的毛泽东思想，并转化为巨大的物质力量，把我国的社会生产力，推向一个更高的水平。
    苏修领导集团面对我国的粮山麦海而睁眼说瞎话，是出于他们的政治需要。他们在国内疯狂地复辟资本主义，使社会主义农业遭到残酷的破坏。粮食生产、供应状况是“王小二过年，一年不如一年”。这一小撮败家子，吃光了斯大林时期所积累下来的贮备粮，现在又靠到西方市场上去排队卖黄金，来进口小麦过日子。对于这一切，苏联的劳动人民是看在眼里，记在心里。因此，苏修集团不仅害怕我国的大丰收，更加害怕造成这个丰收的无产阶级文化大革命。为了垂死挣扎，苏修就编造谣言，妄想掩人耳目，也给自己壮壮胆。
    乌云遮不住太阳，谣言代替不了面包。苏修小丑的狂吠，既抹杀不了我国无产阶级文化大革命的辉煌胜利，也无法遮掩他们自己的日暮途穷。连苏修的农业部长马茨凯维奇与谷物总局局长霍罗希洛夫也不得不承认，他们的“农业发展速度大大下降，七年计划任务未能完成”，“过去七年，粮食问题远远没有解决，因此现在仍然感到粮食极为缺乏，不能满足我国的迫切要求。”过往不佳，今年是否能美妙一些？四月九日霍罗希洛夫又在《真理报》上放风造舆论了。他把严重的政治上的原因推卸为天灾，抱怨春天的天气不好。要求农民再次勒紧裤带“克服困难”。
    裤带可以暂时勒紧，困难却永远不能克服。集体农业经济的破坏，农业收成的下降，就是复辟资本主义的必然恶果。如今在苏联，国营农场、集体农庄，是凄凄惨惨，一片萧条；而投机倒把，自由市场，却熙熙攘攘、异常繁忙。《苏维埃俄罗斯报》不久前就透露，作为重要食品的土豆，在俄罗斯分配计划中，国营农场只完成百分之八十五，集体农庄只完成百分之七十四。乌兹别克《东方真理报》最近也供认：“集体农庄和国营农场供给居民的蔬菜、土豆、水果和葡萄的数量极少”。而自由市场，则另一番天地。据苏修官方《统计通报》今年第一期显然大大缩小了的数字表明，在官方登记的农庄市场就有七千二百多个，平均每月有一千七百多万人在做买卖。有些地区自由市场上销售的蔬菜占总数的百分之七十，土豆占百分之八十，鸡蛋占一半，肉类占百分之四十。自由市场的价格，大大超过了官价。由于资本主义的全面复辟，在大小吸血鬼的层层剥削下，苏联劳动人民的生活越来越苦。“让劳动人民的桌子上有些蔬菜吧！”已成为苏联报刊上引人注目的标题。但是，粮食、蔬菜是呼吁不来的，只有通过革命，把这一小撮反革命修正主义分子统统打倒，苏联人民才能重获解放。
