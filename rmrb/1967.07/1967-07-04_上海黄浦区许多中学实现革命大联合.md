Sixth Girls' School's Experience of Revolutionary Great Criticism and Great Unity Bears Fruit

Many high schools in Shanghai's Huangpu District have achieved revolutionary great unity. By correctly handling the relationships between revolutionary mass organizations and between Red Guards and misled students, uniting to fight against the enemy, and directing the struggle against the capitalist-roaders within the Party, the campuses are now filled with the scene of "resuming classes and making revolution."

The experience of Shanghai No. 6 Girls' School in achieving revolutionary great unity through revolutionary great criticism has been reported nationwide. The Red Guards of the school, located in Huangpu District, enthusiastically acclaimed: "This is our dearest and closest leader, Chairman Mao, who has shown the greatest concern, support, encouragement, and exhortation to the Red Guards!" They immediately launched a campaign to learn from the experience of No. 6 Girls' School. Currently, all 42 middle schools in the district have some classes that have achieved revolutionary great unity. Eleven schools have achieved full-school revolutionary great unity, and more than 20 schools have established preparatory committees for full-school revolutionary great unity. They are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the banner of revolutionary criticism, launching a fierce attack on the capitalist-roaders within the Party, further promoting the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and pushing forward the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units. This has greatly promoted the proletarian cultural revolution in middle schools in the new situation.

The key to eliminating differences between revolutionary mass organizations is to direct the struggle against the capitalist-roaders within the Party.

The experience of Shanghai No. 6 Girls' School in achieving revolutionary great unity can be summed up in one point: to study and apply Mao Zedong Thought actively, to hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism, to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, to concentrate firepower on criticizing the capitalist-roaders within the Party, to criticize the reactionary line represented by them, to criticize their "Self-Cultivation," and to achieve revolutionary great unity through revolutionary great criticism. In the process of revolutionary great criticism, to distinguish between enemies and ourselves, to clarify right and wrong, to eliminate differences, to unify thoughts, and to achieve revolutionary great unity. Schools in Huangpu District that have promoted the experience of No. 6 Girls' School relatively well have all grasped this point.

Jinling Middle School originally had several revolutionary Red Guard organizations that, due to not grasping the direction of the struggle, argued endlessly over trivial issues and fought "internal wars." After learning from the experience of No. 6 Girls' School, they established a preparatory office for achieving revolutionary great unity through revolutionary great criticism and held more than 20 large and small criticism meetings, fiercely criticizing the capitalist-roaders within the Party. Through the criticism, everyone realized that the capitalist-roaders within the Party are the culprits who sabotage the proletarian cultural revolution and the backstage bosses of capitalist restoration. Uprooting this backstage boss is a major issue related to the fate of our Party and country and the future of the world revolution. Everyone identified the main enemy and directed their hatred towards China's Khrushchev, beginning to unify their thoughts. The warriors of each organization sat down calmly and, starting from the desire for unity, conducted criticism and self-criticism, finally ending the three-month-long "internal war" and achieving revolutionary great unity. They said, "There are thousands of reasons for the revolutionary proletariat to unite, but not a single reason to split."

Patiently educating misled students and uniting all possible forces

In the process of promoting the experience of No. 6 Girls' School, there were debates among the Red Guards in Huangpu District. Most Red Guards thought this experience was very good, but some thought the methods of No. 6 Girls' School were "mixing everything together." The focus of the debate was how to deal with students who had participated in conservative organizations. Red Guard organizations that grasped the spirit and essence of the experience of No. 6 Girls' School all directed the spearhead of the struggle against the capitalist-roaders within the Party and, in the process of revolutionary great criticism, patiently educated and united misled students.

Schools like Jinling, Yangjing, Puming, and Dongchang that had already achieved revolutionary great unity originally had conservative organizations. After these organizations were disbanded, there was still antagonism between students who had participated in these organizations and revolutionary Red Guards. Some were unwilling to admit their mistakes. Some knew they had done wrong but were afraid of losing face and did not dare to approach revolutionary Red Guards, fearing discrimination and rejection. Some became depressed and stayed away from the movement for a long time, becoming "free spirits." Some revolutionary Red Guards blamed these students for not participating in the revolution. Some even emphasized "seeking unity in struggle" and insisted that misled students make public self-criticisms. After learning from the experience of No. 6 Girls' School, the revolutionary Red Guards in these schools were enlightened. They followed Chairman Mao's teaching to "unite with all who can be united" and actively organized students who had participated in conservative organizations to join the revolutionary great criticism, raising their awareness in the struggle. During the criticism of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, revolutionary Red Guards in schools like Yangjing and Jinling invited students who had participated in conservative organizations to attend the meetings; students who had participated in conservative organizations criticized "Self-Cultivation," and revolutionary Red Guards actively participated. Through the criticism, the majority of misled students recognized their mistakes.

Many schools' revolutionary Red Guards organized misled students to participate in the great criticism while patiently doing political and ideological work with them. Yangjing Middle School had a conservative organization that had long been opposed to the revolutionary Red Guards. After this organization was disbanded, most of its students expressed a desire to join the revolution, but some revolutionary Red Guards did not welcome them warmly, saying they were "grasping at straws" and "faking rebellion." After the Party Central Committee issued the call to "resume classes and make revolution," the Red Guards and these students returned to the classroom together, but their hearts were not united. The experience of No. 6 Girls' School inspired the revolutionary Red Guards in this school. They used the formula of "unity-criticism-unity" to do political and ideological work with students who had participated in this organization. Red Guards actively sought out these students for heart-to-heart talks, helping them see the big picture. They also invited students who had participated in this organization and later joined the revolution to give their opinions. Students who had participated in this organization criticized the Red Guards for having the mentality of "I am the best" and the shortcomings of "exclusionism," and the Red Guard organization accepted their criticism. In this way, some students who had grievances against the revolutionary Red Guards also said, "We must be clear in our stance, lean to one side, and firmly lean towards the revolutionary proletariat. This is a heavy blow to the capitalist-roaders within the Party."

Firmly opposing anarchism and factionalism, removing obstacles to great unity

Chairman Mao said, "Within the Communist Party, there exist various non-proletarian thoughts, which greatly hinder the execution of the Party's correct line." In Huangpu District, schools that promoted the experience of No. 6 Girls' School and achieved good revolutionary great unity all consciously fought against anarchism, factionalism, individualism, and cliquism within the revolutionary ranks.

Jinling Middle School originally had two revolutionary Red Guard organizations—"August 18th Red Guards" and "Mao Zedong Thought Red Guards." When the largest capitalist-roader within the old Shanghai Municipal Committee personally directed the conservative organization in this school to attack the revolutionary Red Guards, they fought side by side; when criticizing the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, they also fought shoulder to shoulder. However, after the situation turned in favor of the revolutionaries, due to the influence of anarchism, factionalism, individualism, and other non-proletarian thoughts, both sides believed they had the most merits, kept secrets from each other, and developed into sharp opposition. The revolutionary great unity achieved by No. 6 Girls' School had a great impact on them. The leaders of the two organizations held heart-to-heart talks, compared their actions with Chairman Mao's teachings, conducted criticism and self-criticism, and realized that the previous "internal war" was influenced by anarchism and cliquism, these bourgeois thoughts, and the "self" mentality, which did not put the interests of the Party and the country first. They immediately launched a high tide of criticism and, in the process of criticism, repeatedly studied "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas" and the "Three Old Articles," broke down the "self" mentality, and established the "public" mentality, striving to overcome non-proletarian thoughts. They deeply felt, "After we smashed the shackles of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, we must not go to the other extreme and fall into the enemy's trap, nurturing anarchism and cliquism." Now, they have united to establish a unified Red Guard organization.

Revolutionary great unity promotes resuming classes and making revolution

Revolutionary great unity is the foundation for resuming classes and making revolution. Without revolutionary great unity, there can be no revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and there can be no struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. Since the experience of Shanghai No. 6 Girls' School in achieving revolutionary great unity through revolutionary great criticism was promoted in Huangpu District, the cultural revolution in many schools has been greatly advanced.

Many schools, including No. 6 Girls' School, Jinling, Yangjing, and Puming, have achieved revolutionary great unity among revolutionary teachers and staff through revolutionary great criticism. A new teacher-student relationship is being established. Many schools, with a unified Red Guard organization as the core, have closely united all students, successively held a series of meetings to denounce the capitalist-roaders within the Party, to criticize the old Municipal Committee and the old District Committee's capitalist-roaders, to systematically criticize the capitalist-roaders within the Party's poison in education, to criticize the bourgeois textbooks and teaching system, and to promote the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit through revolutionary great criticism. The broad Red Guards are studying Chairman Mao's works and the Party Central Committee's documents on the cultural revolution to guide the current struggle. The resumption of classes and making revolution in these schools has begun. In the course arrangement, they all prioritize the study of Chairman Mao's works. At the same time, they have set up military and political training courses, situation reports, labor courses, review courses (physics, chemistry, foreign languages), and singing revolutionary songs. Students are studying while carrying out the cultural revolution. The campus presents a vibrant and lively revolutionary scene.

　　六女中革命大批判大联合的经验开花结果
　　上海黄浦区许多中学实现革命大联合
    正确处理革命群众组织之间、红卫兵和受蒙蔽同学之间的关系，团结对敌，把斗争矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，校园内呈现一片“复课闹革命”的景象
    本报讯　上海市第六女中红卫兵在革命的大批判中实现革命的大联合的经验，向全国报道以后，市六女中所在的黄浦区各中学红卫兵热烈欢呼：“这是我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，对红卫兵小将的最大关怀、最大支持、最大鼓舞、最大鞭策！”他们立即掀起了向市六女中学习的热潮。现在，全区四十二所中学，每个中学都有一些班级实现了革命的大联合，有十一所中学已经实现全校红卫兵革命大联合，另有二十多所中学成立了全校革命大联合筹备小组。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，高举革命的批判旗帜，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发动勇猛的进攻，进一步推进了革命的“三结合”，推进了本单位的斗批改，对中学的无产阶级文化大革命在新形势下走上正轨起了很大的促进作用。
    矛头对准党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，革命群众组织之间就可以消除分歧
    上海市第六女中红卫兵实现革命大联合的经验归结到一点，就是：活学活用毛泽东思想，高举革命的批判旗帜，牢牢地掌握斗争大方向，集中火力批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，批判以他为代表的资产阶级反动路线，批判他的《修养》，在革命的大批判中，分清敌我，明辨是非，消除分歧，统一思想，实现革命的大联合。黄浦区凡是推广市六女中经验比较好的中学，都紧紧抓住了这一条。
    金陵中学原来几个革命红卫兵组织由于没有抓住斗争的大方向，在一些枝节问题上争论不休，打“内战”。学习了市六女中经验以后，他们成立了在革命的大批判中实现革命大联合的筹备处，召开了大大小小二十多次批判会，狠狠批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派。通过大批判，大家认识到党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派是破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪魁祸首，是复辟资本主义的总后台，挖掉这个总后台，是关系到我们党和国家命运、关系到世界革命前途的大事。大家认清了主要敌人，把仇恨集中在中国的赫鲁晓夫身上，思想上开始统一起来。各个组织的战士平心静气地坐在一起，从团结的愿望出发，进行了批评与自我批评，终于结束了长达三个月的“内战”，实现了革命的大联合。他们说：“无产阶级革命派联合起来的理由有千条万条，找不出半条理由闹分裂。”
    耐心教育受蒙蔽的同学，团结一切可以团结的力量
    黄浦区中学红卫兵推广市六女中经验的过程中，曾经发生过争论。大部分红卫兵认为这个经验好得很，也有人认为市六女中的作法是搞“大杂烩”。分歧的焦点就是如何对待参加过保守组织的同学。凡是掌握了市六女中经验精神实质的红卫兵组织，都是把斗争矛头指向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在革命的大批判中，耐心地教育和团结受蒙蔽的同学。
    已经实现革命大联合的金陵、洋泾、浦明、东昌等中学，原来都有一个保守组织。这些组织解散以后，参加过这些组织的同学和革命红卫兵之间对立情绪还存在。有的人不服气。有的人知道自己做了错事，但是爱面子，没有勇气和革命红卫兵接近，怕受歧视、碰钉子。有的变得消沉起来，长时间游离在运动之外，成了“逍遥派”。有的革命的红卫兵则责怪这些同学不起来革命。有的还片面强调“斗争中求团结”，一定要受蒙蔽的同学公开检查。这些学校的革命红卫兵学习了市六女中经验以后，得到了启发。他们遵循毛主席要“争取团结一切可以团结的人们”的教导，积极组织参加过保守组织的同学参加革命的大批判，在斗争中提高他们的觉悟。洋泾、金陵等中学革命红卫兵，在召开批判资产阶级反动路线大会时，都邀请参加过保守组织的同学参加大会；参加过保守组织的同学开会批判《修养》，革命红卫兵也主动去参加。通过大批判，广大受蒙蔽的同学认识了错误。
    许多中学的革命红卫兵一面组织受蒙蔽的同学参加大批判，一面耐心地对他们做政治思想工作。洋泾中学有个保守组织，长时间同革命红卫兵相对立。这个组织解散以后，其中大部分同学表示要起来革命，部分革命红卫兵没有热情欢迎他们，而是说他们“捞稻草”，“假造反”。党中央发出“复课闹革命”的号召以后，红卫兵和这些同学一同回到班级，人在一班，心各一方。市六女中的经验，启发了这个学校的革命红卫兵。他们运用“团结——批评——团结”的公式，对参加过这个组织的同学做政治思想工作。红卫兵分别主动地找这些同学谈心，帮助他们认清大方向。他们还邀请参加过这个组织、后来起来革命的同学提意见。参加过这个组织的同学批评红卫兵有“老子天下第一”的思想，有“关门主义”的缺点，红卫兵组织接受了他们的批评。这样，原来一些对革命红卫兵有意见的同学也说：“我们要旗帜鲜明，一边倒，坚决倒向无产阶级革命派，这就是对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的沉重打击。”
    大反无政府主义、山头主义，扫除大联合的障碍
    毛主席说：“共产党内存在着各种非无产阶级的思想，这对于执行党的正确路线，妨碍极大。”黄浦区推广市六女中经验，革命的大联合搞得好的中学，都自觉地同革命队伍中的无政府主义、山头主义、风头主义、小团体主义等各种资产阶级思想，进行坚决的斗争。
    金陵中学原来有两个革命的红卫兵组织——“八·一八红卫兵”和“毛泽东主义红卫兵”，在旧上海市委内最大的一个走资本主义道路当权派亲自操纵这个学校的保守组织向革命红卫兵进攻的时候，他们同舟共济，联合作战；在批判资产阶级反动路线的时候，他们也是并肩战斗。但是，形势变得对革命派有利以后，由于无政府主义、山头主义、风头主义等非无产阶级思想的影响，双方都认为自己功劳大，彼此从互相保密，互不通气，发展到尖锐的对立。市六女中实现了革命大联合，对他们震动很大。两个组织的负责人开了谈心会，对照毛主席的教导，进行批评和自我批评，认识到过去打“内战”，是受了无政府主义、小团体主义这些资产阶级思想的影响，是“私”字作怪，没有把党和国家的利益放在第一位。他们立即掀起了大批判的高潮，并在大批判中反复学习了《关于纠正党内的错误思想》和“老三篇”，大破“私”字，大立“公”字，努力克服非无产阶级思想。他们深有感触地说：“当我们粉碎了奴隶主义，冲破了资产阶级反动路线的枷锁以后，千万不能走上另一个极端，中了敌人的奸计，滋长无政府主义、小团体主义。”现在，他们已经联合成立了统一的红卫兵组织。
    革命的大联合促进复课闹革命
    革命的大联合，是搞好复课闹革命的基础。没有革命的大联合，就谈不上革命的“三结合”，也就谈不上本单位的斗批改。上海市六女中在革命的大批判中实现革命大联合的经验，在黄浦区推广以来，把许多中学的文化大革命大大推进了一步。
    市六女中、金陵、洋泾、浦明等不少中学的革命教职员工，在革命的大批判中，也实现了革命的大联合。新型的师生关系正在建立起来。不少中学以统一的红卫兵组织为核心，把全校同学紧密地团结在一起，先后举行了一系列痛斥党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派、批判旧市委、旧区委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大会，系统地批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在教育方面的流毒，批判资产阶级的教材和教学制度，用革命的大批判推进本单位的斗批改。广大红卫兵认真学习毛主席著作，学习党中央关于文化大革命的文件，用来指导当前的斗争。这些中学的复课闹革命已经开展起来。在课程安排上，都是把学习毛主席著作放在第一位。同时，大都设了军政训练课，形势报告课，生产劳动课，复习知识课（物理、化学、外语），以及教唱“革命歌曲大家唱”等等。学生一面学习，一面开展文化大革命。校园内呈现出一片欣欣向荣、生动活泼的革命景象。
