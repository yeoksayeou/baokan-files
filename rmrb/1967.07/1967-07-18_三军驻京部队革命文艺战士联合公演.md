In the new high tide of "beating down the fallen dog" and fiercely fighting the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, the revolutionary artists of the People's Liberation Army's ground, naval, and air forces stationed in Beijing will begin a grand performance tonight. With rich and colorful performances full of revolutionary fighting spirit, they will most enthusiastically praise our dearest leader Chairman Mao, praise the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, praise the great victories of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and praise the great victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They will also fiercely criticize the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. This is a performance under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought.

The joint performance by the revolutionary artists of the three services in Beijing has received the warm care and enthusiastic support of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, Premier Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Li Fuchun, Jiang Qing, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group. It is conducted under the direct leadership of the Party committees and revolutionary leading cadres of the ground, naval, and air forces. The revolutionary artists of the three services, carrying the boundless love of the people and the military for Chairman Mao and their boundless hatred for the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, will take to the stage. Every song and dance they perform is a brilliant ode to great Mao Zedong Thought, a battle song of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and at the same time, a dagger and cannon aimed at the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party.

Tonight's performance begins with the grand song and dance "Celebrating the 25th Anniversary of Chairman Mao's Brilliant Work 'Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art'." Over 300 performers, with Mao's quotations songs and rich dance movements, vividly depict the brilliant light of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line, and show the resolute will and heroic spirit of the revolutionary masses to thoroughly uproot the black line in literature and art and its backstage boss, and to seize the stage of literature and art. Another grand song and dance "Long Live the Victory of Chairman Mao's Revolutionary Literary and Artistic Line" enthusiastically praises the one-year anniversary of the issuance of the "Summary of the Symposium on Army Literary and Artistic Work Convened by Comrade Lin Biao and Comrade Jiang Qing," and warmly celebrates the great victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary literary and artistic line. The grand song and dance "Revolutionary Historical Songs Performance" sings the great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought in various revolutionary periods, praises Chairman Mao's armed struggle and people's war thoughts, and expresses the boundless love and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao. Their performance of the song and dance drama "Chairman Mao Comes to Our Ship" expresses with sincere feelings and enthusiastic songs and dances the longing of the people's sailors for the great leader Chairman Mao day and night. They also performed the dance "Fiercely Attack the Number One Power-Holder Taking the Capitalist Road Within the Party," reflecting the current great struggle of criticism. The performers, with the greatest indignation, expressed the hatred of hundreds of millions of workers, peasants, and soldiers across the country for the number one power-holder taking the capitalist road within the Party and their determination to thoroughly overthrow him. The solo performances by Zhang Yizhe, Jia Shijun, and others are all filled with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, singing Mao's poems and quotations songs with great enthusiasm.

The wonderful revolutionary literary and artistic programs of this joint performance are the rich fruits of the revolutionary artists of the three services in Beijing actively participating in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are a vivid reflection of their breaking away from the anti-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art and holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong's literary and artistic thought. The revolutionary artists participating in the joint performance have, in the process of rehearsing and performing, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, always putting revolution first. They have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's call to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, firmly stood on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and bravely joined the great decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. In the fierce class struggle, they have held a series of struggle meetings and criticism meetings, fiercely fighting the biggest group of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the army, and fiercely criticizing the anti-revolutionary revisionist black line in literature and art. Tonight's performance programs are a great review of the victory of "grasp revolution, promote production" by the revolutionary artists of the ground, naval, and air forces stationed in Beijing.

The revolutionary artists of the three services in Beijing, who have achieved great unity in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, began preparations for the joint performance in April this year. They have displayed the sky-high revolutionary enthusiasm that has emerged in the Cultural Revolution, "grasp revolution, promote production," and while revolutionizing, they have performed with high revolutionary enthusiasm, deeply entering streets, factories, military camps, and rural areas, and carried out extensive performances and solicitation of opinions. They have performed nearly 100 times, with an audience of nearly 500,000 to 600,000 workers, peasants, and soldiers. Through struggle practice and deep interaction with workers, peasants, and soldiers, the performance programs have been further enriched and improved.
