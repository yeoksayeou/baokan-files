The red sun in the hearts of all nationalities, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "The unity of the country, the unity of the people, and the unity of all nationalities within the country are the basic guarantees of the success of our cause."

Under the guidance of this great teaching of Chairman Mao, and under the leadership of the Communist Party of China, the people of all nationalities in our country have united, fought together, and achieved victory together. Under the leadership of the Party and Chairman Mao, the people of all nationalities have worked together to drive out imperialism, defeat the reactionary Kuomintang, overthrow the oppression of the feudal landlords, and achieve true national equality.

Today, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the proletarian revolutionary factions of all nationalities have stood shoulder to shoulder on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Following the direction of struggle indicated by Chairman Mao, they have fought together and achieved one great victory after another. In our province of Guizhou, the revolutionary factions of the minority nationalities, together with our Han brothers, have rebelled against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the provincial Party committee, seized their power, and taken over their political affairs, firmly grasping the seal of the proletariat in our own hands.

Imperialism fears the unity of all nationalities in China, and revisionism also fears our unity. The traitors Brezhnev, Kosygin, and others are panic-stricken and trembling all over in the face of the great unity and victory of all nationalities in our country. Thus, through their radio stations and newspapers, they have issued one delusion after another and shot one poisoned arrow after another, attempting to sow discord among the people of all nationalities in our country, create divisions, and sabotage unity.

Not long ago, the Soviet revisionist newspaper *Izvestia* published an article by the revisionist Dimkov, viciously attacking the Communist Party of China's national policy as a continuation of the "Guomindang assimilation policy" and claiming that the Communist Party of China is promoting "Great Han chauvinism," and so on. This is sheer nonsense.

The Soviet revisionist traitors want to grasp at a straw in the matter of the Chinese nationalities, but the fact of the unity of all nationalities in China has completely shattered their beautiful dream. Just by recounting the miserable plight of the people of all nationalities in Guizhou Province before liberation and the earth-shaking changes after liberation, the infamous lies of the Soviet revisionists will be exposed.

The clear and beautiful plateau of Guizhou, from the Miao Mountains to the Wu River, is home to nine minority nationalities: the Miao, Yao, Yi, Hui, Buyi, Dong, Shu, Zhuang, and Gelao, totaling over four million people, accounting for one-quarter of the total population of Guizhou Province.

In the dark old China, the poor and lower-middle peasants and urban proletariat of the minority nationalities were oppressed by the three big mountains of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, living at the bottom of society. Generation after generation, they were enslaved, and year after year, they lived in rags and hunger. The old and young were illiterate, and generation after generation, they were blind.

Since the arrival of our savior, Chairman Mao, and the Communist Party he leads, the minority nationalities have been liberated and become the masters of the state. Now, our entire province has established two autonomous prefectures, eight autonomous counties, and many autonomous townships for nationalities. We ourselves hold the power. Representatives of the minority nationalities also participate in the leadership of the Party and the state at various levels. The production in the minority nationality areas has developed rapidly, and the primitive slash-and-burn farming has been completely abolished. The economic life of the people has gradually improved. The children of the minority nationalities have had the opportunity to go to school. In the eight colleges and universities, hundreds of middle schools, and thousands of primary schools throughout the province, there are students from the minority nationalities. The Party and the state have trained a large number of cadres for us minority nationalities. The number of minority nationality cadres in various leadership and working positions throughout the province has increased from over six hundred in the early days of liberation to more than twenty-four thousand today.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary factions of the minority nationalities, together with our Han brothers, have used the great democratic forms of big debates, big-character posters, and big discussions to launch a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. The Red Guards of the Miao nationality and the Red Guards of other nationalities have gone to Beijing and throughout the country to accept the inspection of the great leader Chairman Mao and have been tempered in the great storms.

We are the true masters of the state. The great democracy we enjoy is something that not only the minority nationalities but also the broad masses of the Soviet people do not have today. In today's Soviet Union, not only can one not criticize the Marxist-Leninist traitors—the Soviet revisionist leaders—but even having the slightest suspicion of dissatisfaction with the Soviet revisionist leaders will result in being thrown into prison or a mental hospital.

The facts prove that the Soviet revisionist leadership has not only destroyed Lenin's policy of equality and mutual friendship among nationalities but also practices fascist dictatorship throughout the Soviet Union.

Lenin said: "Those pseudo-Marxists who denounce other nationalities' Marxists for advocating 'assimilation' are actually only exposing their own nationalism." Lenin's words are also a pointed criticism of today's Soviet revisionist traitors.

Is it not precisely Khrushchev and his faithful successors, Brezhnev, Kosygin, and others, who have thrown Lenin's national policy of the Soviet state to the winds? Your newspapers have already publicly admitted that "the remnants of nationalism in people's minds have resurfaced"? In various places in the Soviet Union, national contradictions are developing, minority nationalities are discriminated against and even persecuted, and national cultures are being destroyed. Some intellectuals in Ukraine who advocate making their national language an official language have been sentenced to long-term imprisonment!

You spread rumors and attack us, only to expose yourselves!

The attacks of the Soviet revisionist traitors on us can only further expose the ugly faces of the traitors.

The unity of all nationalities in China is unbreakable. We will firmly follow Chairman Mao's teaching that the proletariat can only liberate all of humanity to finally liberate itself. We will not only make the nationalities within the country more united but also unite with the revolutionary people of the Soviet Union and with all the oppressed people and oppressed nationalities in the world. We will greatly create the counter-revolution against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, thoroughly smash the old world, and build a brilliant and red communist new world with Mao Zedong Thought.

Let the Soviet revisionist traitors tremble before the iron unity of all nationalities in our country!

    让苏修在我国各族人民磐石般的大团结面前发抖吧！
    贵州省　苗族　张应保
    各族人民心中的红太阳毛主席教导说：“国家的统一，人民的团结，国内各民族的团结，这是我们的事业必定要胜利的基本保证。”
    我国各族人民遵循着毛主席的这一伟大教导，在中国共产党的领导下，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。在党和毛主席领导下，各族人民共同努力，赶走了帝国主义，打败了国民党反动派，推翻了封建地主的压迫，实现了真正的民族平等。
    今天，在毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命中，各民族的无产阶级革命派，又并肩地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，沿着毛主席指引的斗争大方向，团结战斗，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。我们贵州省少数民族的革命派同汉族兄弟一起，造了省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，夺了他们的权，专了他们的政，把无产阶级的大印牢牢地掌握在自己手里。
    帝国主义害怕中国各民族的团结，修正主义也害怕我们团结。勃列日涅夫、柯西金等叛徒，在我国各族人民大团结大胜利面前惊慌失措，浑身发抖，于是通过他们的电台、报纸，发出了一个又一个梦呓，射出了一支又一支毒箭，妄图挑拨我国各族人民的关系，制造分裂，破坏团结。
    不久前，苏修《消息报》刊登了修正主义分子迪姆科夫的文章，恶毒攻击中国共产党的民族政策是什么“国民党同化政策的继续”，什么中国共产党正在推行“大汉族沙文主义”等等。纯粹是胡说八道。
    苏修叛徒们想在中国民族问题上捞一根稻草，但是中国各族人民团结一致的事实，彻底粉碎了苏修的美梦。只要讲一讲我们贵州省各族人民解放前的悲惨遭遇和解放后的翻天覆地变化，苏修的无耻谰言也就不攻自破了。
    山清水秀的贵州高原，从苗岭到乌江，居住有我们苗、瑶、彝、回、布依、侗、水、壮、仡佬等九个少数民族，共计四百余万人，占贵州省总人口的四分之一。
    在黑暗的旧中国，我们少数民族的贫下中农和城市无产者，在帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义三座大山压迫下，生活在最下层，一代代遭奴役，一年年过着衣不蔽体、食不果腹的日子，老老小小一字不识，祖祖辈辈是睁眼瞎子。
    自从来了我们的救命恩人毛主席领导下的共产党，我们少数民族翻了身，当了国家的主人。现在我们全省成立了两个民族自治州、八个民族自治县、许多民族自治乡，我们自己掌了权。我们少数民族的代表还参加了党和国家的各级领导。少数民族地区的生产迅速发展，刀耕火种的生产方式已彻底废除，人民的经济生活逐步得到了改善。少数民族的子弟得到了上学的机会。全省八所大专院校，几百所中学和上千所小学里都有我们少数民族的子弟在读书。党和国家为我们少数民族培养了大批自己的干部。在全省各级领导岗位和工作岗位上的少数民族干部，从解放初期的六百多人增到现在的二万四千多人。
    在文化大革命中，我们少数民族的革命派，同汉族兄弟一起，采用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的大民主形式，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派猛烈开火。我们苗族的红卫兵和其他各族的红卫兵小将，到北京，到全国，接受伟大领袖毛主席的检阅，在大风大浪中锻炼。
    我们是国家的真正主人。我们享有的大民主，在今日的苏联不仅少数民族没有，就是广大的苏联人民也根本没有这种权利。在今天的苏联，不仅不能给马列主义的叛徒——苏修领导提意见，贴大字报，就是连有一点对苏修领导不满的嫌疑也会被关进监狱或是疯人院。
    事实证明，苏修领导集团不仅是破坏了列宁关于各族人民平等和互相友爱的政策，而且在整个苏联实行法西斯专政。
    列宁说过：“那些大骂其他民族的马克思主义者赞成‘同化’的冒牌马克思主义者，实际上只是表明他们自己是民族主义的市侩而已。”列宁的话对今天的苏修叛徒也是一针见血的。
    难道不正是赫鲁晓夫及其忠实继承者勃列日涅夫、柯西金等等，把列宁制定的苏维埃国家的民族政策抛到九霄云外去了吗？你们的报纸不是已公开承认“人们意识中民族主义的残余复发了”？在苏联各地民族矛盾在发展，少数民族遭到歧视，甚至虐待。民族文化遭到摧残，乌克兰的一些知识分子主张把本民族语言列为正式语言竟被判处长期徒刑！
    你们造谣攻击我们，结果是暴露了自己！
    苏修叛徒们对我们的攻击，只能更进一步暴露叛徒的丑恶嘴脸。
    中国各族人民的团结是牢不可破的。我们将坚决遵照毛主席关于无产阶级只有解放全人类，才能最后解放自己的教导，不仅要使国内各民族团结得更紧，还要同苏联的革命人民团结起来，同全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族团结起来，大造特造帝、修、反的反，彻底砸烂旧世界，用毛泽东思想来建设一个光辉灿烂的红彤彤的共产主义新世界。
    让苏修叛徒们在我国各族人民磐石般的大团结面前发抖吧！
