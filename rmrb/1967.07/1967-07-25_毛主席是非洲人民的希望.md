A ship from Cyprus entered Huangpu Port. A sailor from Zanzibar on board, upon seeing our country's staff, walked up and gave a thumbs up, saying, "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" This African sailor was excitedly touching the Mao badge on the staff member's chest. Our staff understood his meaning and took off the Mao badge to give to this African friend. The African sailor was overjoyed, made a "wait a moment" gesture, and quickly ran back to his room. Soon, he returned wearing a new traditional outfit and happily walked up to our staff member. Our staff then pinned the Mao badge on his chest. The African sailor and our staff member embraced warmly, and the sailor excitedly said, "The Chinese revolution has set an example for all countries striving for national independence. We respect Mao Zedong; he is the red sun rising in the East, the hope of progressive humanity. With Chairman Mao, we African people have hope. Mao Zedong Thought is a torch illuminating all humanity, a compass guiding the struggle for the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America.

    毛主席是非洲人民的希望
    “呜——”一艘塞浦路斯的商船驶进了黄埔港。船上的一位桑给巴尔水手一见到我国工作人员，就走上前去，翘起大拇指说：“毛泽东！毛泽东！”这位非洲水手激动地抚摸着工作人员胸前佩戴的毛主席像章。我国工作人员懂得了他的意思，便把毛主席像章取下来，赠给这位非洲朋友。这位非洲海员高兴极了，作了一个等一等的手势，飞快地跑回房间，不一会，他就换了一件崭新的民族服装，兴高采烈地走到我国工作人员面前。我国工作人员便把毛主席像章戴在他胸前。这位非洲海员同我国工作人员热烈地拥抱起来，并兴奋地说：“中国的革命给一切正在争取民族独立的国家树立了一个榜样。我们敬爱毛泽东，他是东方升起的红太阳，是进步人类的希望。有了毛主席，我们非洲人民就有了希望。毛泽东思想是一支照亮全人类的火炬，是为被压迫的亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲人民指示斗争方向的罗盘。
