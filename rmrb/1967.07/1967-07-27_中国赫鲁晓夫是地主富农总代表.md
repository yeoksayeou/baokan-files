	China's Khrushchev is the representative of landlords and rich peasants. Every page of blood-stained history and every drop of bitter tears teach us to remember class hatred and to keep the revolution going without turning back.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "The agricultural cooperativization movement, from the very beginning, was a serious struggle of ideas and politics." Indeed, the overthrown reactionary ruling class is not reconciled to its own destruction. They always wait for an opportunity to counterattack, sabotage the agricultural cooperativization movement, oppose the people's communes, and attempt to restore capitalism. In 1962, our country's rural people's communes embarked on a path of consolidation and development, showing their unparalleled superiority in all aspects. However, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party advocated "three freedoms and one contract," spreading a black wind of individual farming. Landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists took the opportunity to "break out of their doors," moving about everywhere. They looked at the corners of houses and checked the boundaries of fields, dreaming of a change in the sky. One landlord even brazenly told an old poor peasant who had been given his house during the land reform to fix it up. It was this fellow who had hidden his account of changing the sky for twenty years, which was dug up during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	For more than ten years since liberation, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party has always worn the cloak of an "old revolutionary," paving the way for the restoration of capitalism; landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, under his protection and instigation, have been engaged in activities to restore capitalism. China's Khrushchev is the representative of landlords and rich peasants, the sworn enemy of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We must criticize and expose him thoroughly.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: In the historical stage of socialism, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, there is a struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and there is the danger of capitalist restoration. We must never forget class struggle. If the venomous snake is not eliminated, it will harm people; if class struggle is not grasped, the sky will change. The biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party is the biggest venomous snake beside us. We must eliminate him. We must remember Chairman Mao's teaching of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," always keep in mind class struggle, always keep in mind the dictatorship of the proletariat, always keep in mind putting politics in command, always keep in mind holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and fight to the end with all reactionaries to ensure that the proletarian iron fortress remains forever red.

    中国赫鲁晓夫是地主富农总代表
    迟宽令
    篇篇血泪史，滴滴辛酸泪，教育我们牢记阶级仇，永远革命不回头。
    毛主席教导我们：“农业合作化运动，从一开始，就是一种严重的思想的和政治的斗争。”事实正是这样，被推翻的反动统治阶级并不甘心于自己的灭亡，他们总是伺机反攻，破坏农业合作化运动，反对人民公社，企图复辟资本主义。一九六二年，我国农村人民公社走上了巩固发展的道路，在各方面都显示出它的无比优越性。但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却鼓吹“三自一包”，大刮单干黑风。农村的地富反坏右趁机“破门而出”，四处活动，他们看房角，查地界，梦想变天。有一个地主分子，甚至明目张胆地告诉在土改时分了他房子的老贫农，把房子给他修理好。就是这个家伙隐藏了二十年的变天账，在无产阶级文化大革命中被挖了出来。
    解放后十几年来，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，一直披着“老革命”的外衣，为资本主义复辟鸣锣开道；地富反坏右分子在他的保护、怂恿下，一直在搞资本主义复辟活动。中国的赫鲁晓夫就是地主、富农的总代表，是咱贫下中农的死对头，我们一定要把他批倒、批臭。
    毛主席教导我们：在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。千万不要忘记阶级斗争。毒蛇不除要伤人，阶级斗争不抓要变天。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派就是我们身边最大的毒蛇，我们一定要把他除掉。我们要牢记毛主席“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同一切反动派斗争到底，保证无产阶级铁打江山永远鲜红。
