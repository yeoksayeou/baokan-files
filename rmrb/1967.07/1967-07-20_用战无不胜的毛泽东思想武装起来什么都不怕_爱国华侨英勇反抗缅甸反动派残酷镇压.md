The reactionary government of Ne Win in Burma has recently unleashed a frenzied anti-China campaign, savagely massacring patriotic overseas Chinese, committing heinous crimes!

To this day, no one knows exactly how many patriotic overseas Chinese have been killed in Burma. The Ne Win reactionary government, fearing exposure of its fascist crimes, has imposed a complete news blackout. It is reported that in just one hospital, over a hundred bodies of murdered overseas Chinese were found. Many overseas Chinese were burned to ashes after being killed, to destroy the evidence. In addition, many overseas Chinese were severely injured, countless were arrested, and many are still missing!

However, the available evidence is sufficient to prove that the fascist atrocities committed by the Ne Win reactionary government in Burma are unprecedented in their cruelty, barbarism, and horror!

On the afternoon of June 27, over three hundred thugs, incited by the Ne Win reactionary government, launched a savage attack on the Overseas Chinese Teachers' Association. The thugs set fire to the association's building and then blocked the stairways, armed with various weapons, savagely beating and hacking at the overseas Chinese teachers and students who rushed out of the flames. At this most perilous moment, these overseas Chinese teachers and students, who love our great motherland and our great leader Chairman Mao with all their hearts, shouted "Long live Chairman Mao" and bravely fought their way out of the inferno.

At this point, the thugs, like mad beasts, brandished their weapons and savagely beat and hacked at these brave teachers and students. More than twenty teachers and students fell in a pool of blood, heroically sacrificing their lives. Many were seriously injured. The deputy chairman of the Overseas Chinese Teachers' Association, Zhou Yingru, was brutally murdered by the thugs. Before her martyrdom, she tightly embraced a portrait of Chairman Mao, standing firmly and fearlessly before the thugs, shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" Teacher Zhou Suying had all her teeth knocked out, one eye gouged out, and her entire body beaten to a pulp, but she never surrendered to the thugs until her last breath.

The Ne Win reactionary military clique is a bunch of brutal Nazi thugs, bloodthirsty executioners. When the thugs saw overseas Chinese youth wearing Chairman Mao badges, they forced them to take them off. When their unreasonable demands were refused, they cut off the Chairman Mao badges along with the flesh from the chests of the wearers. Someone witnessed a group of thugs throwing a Chinese mother and her two children (one six years old, the other eight) into a fire. A pair of innocent Chinese sisters (one sixteen years old, the other eighteen) who went out to buy food in the morning were also brutally shot by the thugs.

The Ne Win reactionary government shamelessly ordered thugs to annihilate entire families of patriotic overseas Chinese and loot their property. In the Ganma Yu area of Rangoon, thugs broke into a Chinese household, raped the Chinese women. When the father and brothers came to rescue her, the thugs killed all five members of the family. In the Ganma Yu area alone, many patriotic overseas Chinese families were completely wiped out. Almost all Chinese residences were looted by the thugs, leaving only the bare walls. Currently, many overseas Chinese are lacking food and shelter, homeless.

The fascist atrocities of the Ne Win reactionary government are countless. They dreamt of stopping the patriotic overseas Chinese from loving our great motherland and our great leader Chairman Mao by carrying out large-scale massacres and arrests. However, the vast number of patriotic overseas Chinese, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, did not falter in the face of the butcher knives, clubs, and other weapons of the Burmese reactionaries. They waged an unyielding and heroic struggle. Some Burmese friends also expressed admiration for the brave patriotic overseas Chinese. Some said, "The Chinese truly have backbone. In the face of such brutal massacres, they did not shed a single tear. They are truly remarkable."

On June 26, the Ne Win reactionary authorities issued a notice to each student of the former Nanyang Middle School and the Overseas Chinese Middle School, prohibiting them from wearing Chairman Mao badges. This unreasonable action immediately met with resistance from the overseas Chinese students. Some students refused to accept the notice, while others tore it up into pieces after receiving it. Overseas Chinese students gathered together, singing songs of Chairman Mao's quotations and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" The Ne Win reactionary authorities organized thugs that day to surround and attack the overseas Chinese students, resulting in a bloody massacre; on the night of the 27th, over five hundred overseas Chinese students from the two schools were arrested and taken to the Mingalar Ton military camp. Overseas Chinese students, in self-defense, bravely resisted the persecution of the Burmese reactionary army. They also strongly protested to the Ne Win reactionary military police and went on a hunger strike. They sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, with the singing rising and falling, louder and louder. The reactionary camp was turned into a place to denounce the fascist atrocities of the Ne Win clique. The heroic struggle of the overseas Chinese students and the strong support of the people of the motherland forced the Ne Win reactionary clique to announce the release of the arrested students on July 4. When leaving the military camp to return home, many students still wore the shining Chairman Mao badges on their chests.

Recently, a group of patriotic overseas Chinese wrote in a letter to the Chinese Embassy: "The heinous crimes committed by the Burmese reactionary government do not indicate their strength, but only their desperate struggles. The more barbaric they are, the faster they will die. To intimidate overseas Chinese with force is their daydreaming. We overseas Chinese have the invincible thought of Mao Zedong as our weapon and the seven hundred million people of our motherland as our backing. We fear nothing."

The Ne Win reactionary government has committed heinous fascist atrocities, owing a blood debt to the Chinese people. The blood of the patriotic overseas Chinese will not be shed in vain. The Chinese people must settle this blood debt with the Ne Win reactionary government!

    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来什么都不怕
    爱国华侨英勇反抗缅甸反动派残酷镇压
    缅甸奈温反动政府，最近掀起疯狂反华、迫害华侨的妖风，野蛮屠杀爱国华侨，犯下了滔天罪行！
    到现在为止，还没有人知道，到底有多少爱国华侨在缅甸遭受杀害，因为奈温反动政府做贼心虚，害怕它的种种法西斯罪行暴露出来，进行了彻底的新闻封锁。据悉，仅仅在一个医院里，就发现了一百多具被杀害的华侨尸体。许多华侨被杀害后，缅甸奈温反动政府就把他们的尸体当场焚毁，以便消灭罪证。除此以外，大批华侨被打伤，无数华侨被逮捕，许多华侨至今下落不明！
    但是现有材料已经足以证明，缅甸奈温反动政府所犯下的法西斯暴行是空前地残酷，野蛮和骇人听闻的！
    六月二十七日下午，受奈温反动政府唆使的三百多名暴徒疯狂袭击华侨教师联合会。暴徒们放火烧联合会的房子，然后封锁楼梯，手里拿着各式各样的凶器，猛打从火中冲出来的华侨教师和学生。在这个最危险的时刻，这些无限热爱我们伟大的祖国和我们伟大的领袖毛主席的华侨教师和学生，高呼“毛主席万岁”，勇敢地从火海中杀出来。
    这时，暴徒象疯狂的野兽一样，挥动凶器，野蛮地殴打、乱砍这些英勇的教师和学生，二十多个教师和学生倒在血泊中英勇地牺牲了。许多人受重伤。华侨教师联合会副主席周颖如被暴徒残酷杀害，她在牺牲前一直紧抱着毛主席像，坚定地、无畏地站在暴徒面前，高呼：“毛主席万岁！”教师周素英，所有的牙齿都被打掉了，一个眼球被挖掉，全身被打得血肉模糊，但是她至死也没有向暴徒屈服。
    奈温反动军人集团是一批残暴的纳粹党徒，嗜血成性的刽子手。暴徒们看到华侨男女青年佩戴毛主席像章，就强迫他们取下。当暴徒们的无理要求遭到拒绝时，他们就把毛主席像章连同佩戴者胸部的皮肉一起割下来。有人亲眼看到一批暴徒把一个华侨母亲和她的两个孩子（一个六岁，另一个八岁）扔进火堆里。有一对无辜的华侨姐妹（一个十六岁，一个十八岁）早上出去买食物，也被暴徒给残酷地枪杀了。
    缅甸奈温反动政府肆无忌惮地指使暴徒消灭爱国华侨的整个家庭和抢劫他们的财产。在仰光的甘马育地区，暴徒们破门进入一个华侨的屋子里，轮奸华侨妇女。当她的父亲和兄弟出来援救时，暴徒把这家五口人全都残杀了。单单在甘马育地区，就有许多爱国华侨全家被杀绝。几乎所有华侨的住宅都被暴徒洗劫一空，只剩下了屋架子。目前，许多华侨缺衣少食，无家可归。
    奈温反动政府的法西斯暴行是数不清的。它梦想用对爱国华侨进行大规模的屠杀和逮捕来阻止他们无限地热爱我们伟大的祖国和伟大的领袖毛主席。但是，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的广大爱国华侨，在缅甸反动派的屠刀、木棍和其他杀人武器面前，并没有被吓倒，他们进行了不屈不挠的英勇斗争。有些缅甸朋友也对英勇的爱国华侨表示钦佩。有的说：“中国人真正有骨气。在这种残酷的屠杀面前，他们甚至没有淌一滴眼泪。他们真是了不起。”
    六月二十六日，奈温反动当局向原南洋中学和华侨中学的学生每人发一张通知，禁止华侨学生佩戴毛主席像章。这种无理行动立即遭到华侨学生的反击。有些学生拒绝接受通知，另一些学生收到通知之后立即把它撕成碎片。华侨学生聚集在一起，高唱毛主席语录歌，高呼“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”奈温反动当局，当天就组织暴徒包围和袭击华侨学生，造成了流血惨案；二十七日深夜，又逮捕这两个学校的五百多名华侨学生，把他们关进明加拉顿军营。华侨学生为了自卫，英勇抵抗缅甸反动军队的迫害。他们还向奈温反动军警提出强烈抗议，并举行绝食。他们高唱毛主席语录歌，歌声此伏彼起，一阵高过一阵。反动军营被变成了控诉奈温集团法西斯暴行的场所。华侨学生的英勇斗争和祖国人民的强大声援，迫使奈温反动集团七月四日宣布释放被捕学生。在离开军营回家时，许多学生胸前仍然佩戴着闪闪发光的毛主席像章。
    最近，一群爱国华侨在写给中国大使馆的信中说：“缅甸反动政府所犯的滔天罪行并不表明他们的强大，只是表明他们的垂死挣扎。他们越是野蛮，就死亡得越快。想用武力来吓倒华侨，这是他们在白日作梦。我们华侨有战无不胜的毛泽东思想作武器，有我们祖国的七亿人民作后盾，什么也不怕。”
    奈温反动政府干下了罪恶滔天的法西斯暴行，对中国人民欠下的血债累累。爱国华侨的血是决不会白流的，中国人民一定要同奈温反动政府清算这笔血债！　新华社记者
