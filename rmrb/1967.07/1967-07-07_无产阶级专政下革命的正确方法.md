The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. To carry out this great revolution, we must follow the teachings of Chairman Mao, mobilize the masses, and use the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, that is, the methods of free discussion, free airing of views, wall posters, and great debate.

Currently, in some places, there is a serious trend of fighting, smashing, looting, searching, and arresting, which is a serious violation of Chairman Mao's teachings.

This trend can only create chaos, allowing counter-revolutionaries and bad elements to fish in troubled waters and cause trouble; it can only undermine the authority of the dictatorship of the proletariat, disrupt the order of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, disrupt the normal conduct of free discussion, free airing of views, wall posters, and great debate, and damage state and collective property.

It is imperative to strictly prohibit the trend of fighting, smashing, looting, searching, and arresting, and ensure that free discussion, free airing of views, wall posters, and great debate can proceed normally. This is a major issue in ensuring that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution advances along the correct revolutionary path to victory.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has brilliantly and creatively developed Marxism-Leninism, raising it to the new stage of Mao Zedong Thought. The main feature of this stage is that it has solved the problem of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, both theoretically and practically. Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, whether or not to carry out a revolution, whose revolution to carry out, and how to carry it out, these new issues in the development of Marxism, Chairman Mao has provided scientific answers. The theories, lines, policies, and guidelines that Chairman Mao has formulated for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution are the latest developments of Mao Zedong Thought and are our guide to action.

How to carry out a revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat? This is the method of free discussion, free airing of views, wall posters, and great debate proposed by Chairman Mao.

Free discussion, free airing of views, wall posters, and great debate are Chairman Mao's scientific summation of the experience of revolutionary mass movements, especially the experience of revolutionary mass movements under the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a major principle of Mao Zedong Thought and an important part of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Fighting, smashing, looting, searching, and arresting are not proletarian methods of struggle and are not methods of carrying out a revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. They are savage means used by the landlord and bourgeoisie to suppress the people. In the revolutionary struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat, engaging in fighting, smashing, looting, searching, and arresting is itself a disruption of the dictatorship of the proletariat, a disruption of the great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, a disruption of the "four greats," and a disruption of the smooth progress of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

The target of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country is the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The contradiction between the broad revolutionary masses and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is an antagonistic contradiction, an enemy contradiction. The revolutionary path and methods to resolve this contradiction are to mobilize hundreds of millions of people from the bottom up, using the methods of free discussion, free airing of views, wall posters, and great debate, to expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to overthrow them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and to seize power from them. The methods of fighting, smashing, looting, searching, and arresting are fundamentally incapable of solving this problem.

In dealing with comrades, revolutionary mass organizations, and the masses in conservative organizations who have been deceived, it is even more impermissible to use the methods of fighting, smashing, looting, searching, and arresting. Instead, we must adhere to the principle of "unity-criticism-unity" and do patient and painstaking political and ideological work. Only in this way can we resolve contradictions, eliminate differences, unify thinking, and unite to fight the enemy. Chairman Mao recently instructed us: As long as we do painstaking political and ideological work, problems can always be solved for revolutionary mass organizations that are in serious opposition to each other. As for conservative mass organizations with people, and even reactionary organizations, we must also do painstaking political and ideological work. We must firmly remember and resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instruction.

When the proletarian revolutionary faction is suppressed by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to overthrow their reactionary rule, we must use the methods of free discussion, free airing of views, wall posters, and great debate to fully expose their heinous crimes against the Party, against socialism, and against Mao Zedong Thought. After the proletarian revolutionary faction seizes power, we must continue to use the methods of free discussion, free airing of views, wall posters, and great debate to thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to thoroughly eliminate their poison in all aspects, to educate the masses, and to promote the revolutionization of people's thinking.

The proletarian revolutionary faction should become a model in using the methods of free discussion, free airing of views, wall posters, and great debate to carry out the revolution, a model in consciously upholding the authority of the dictatorship of the proletariat, a model in observing proletarian revolutionary discipline, a model in implementing the policies of the Party and the state, and a model in grasping the major direction of the struggle. At the same time, if the proletarian revolutionary faction has shortcomings and mistakes, it should seriously engage in self-criticism and allow others to criticize it, and it should not suppress others just because it has seized power.

Whether to adhere to free discussion, free airing of views, wall posters, and great debate, or to engage in fighting, smashing, looting, searching, and arresting, is not just a simple matter of method or style, but a fundamental issue of whether the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is advancing along the correct path, whether it adheres to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and whether it adheres to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

All revolutionary comrades and revolutionary mass organizations must be highly vigilant and resolutely oppose and stop the trend of fighting, smashing, looting, searching, and arresting, use the correct methods of carrying out a revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, grasp the main contradiction, firmly grasp the major direction of the struggle, thoroughly overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

　　无产阶级专政下革命的正确方法
　　任立新
    无产阶级文化大革命，是在无产阶级专政条件下的大革命。开展这场大革命，必须按照毛主席的教导，放手发动群众，运用无产阶级专政条件下的大民主，即大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的方法进行。
    当前，某些地方出现的打、砸、抢、抄、抓的武斗歪风，是严重地违反了毛主席教导的。
    这股歪风，只能制造混乱，便于反革命分子和坏分子混水摸鱼，乘机捣乱；只能破坏无产阶级专政权威，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的秩序，破坏大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的正常进行，破坏国家和集体财产。
    严禁打、砸、抢、抄、抓的武斗歪风，使大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论得以正常进行，这是保证无产阶级文化大革命沿着正确的革命道路胜利前进的重大问题。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席天才地、创造性地发展了马克思列宁主义，把马克思列宁主义提高到崭新的毛泽东思想阶段。这个阶段的主要标志，就是从理论上和实践上解决了无产阶级专政下的革命问题。在无产阶级专政下，要不要革命？革谁的命？怎样进行革命？这些马克思主义发展史上的新课题，毛主席都提出了科学的结论。毛主席为无产阶级文化大革命制订的理论、路线、方针和政策，就是毛泽东思想最新的发展，就是我们行动的指南。
    在无产阶级专政下怎样进行革命呢？这就是毛主席提出的大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的方法。
    大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论，是毛主席对革命群众运动经验的科学总结，特别是对无产阶级专政条件下革命群众运动经验的科学总结。这是毛泽东思想的重大的原则问题，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的重要组成部分。
    打、砸、抢、抄、抓，根本不是无产阶级的斗争方法，根本不是无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的方法。它是地主资产阶级用来对付人民群众的野蛮手段。在无产阶级专政条件下的革命斗争中，搞打、砸、抢、抄、抓，本身就是破坏无产阶级专政，就是破坏无产阶级专政条件下的大民主，就是破坏“四大”，破坏无产阶级文化大革命的顺利进行。
    我国无产阶级文化大革命的对象，是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。广大革命人民同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾，是对抗性的矛盾，是敌我矛盾。解决这个矛盾的革命道路和方法，就是自下而上地发动亿万群众，运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的方法，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揭露出来，把他们从政治上、思想上、理论上斗臭、斗倒、斗垮，向他们夺权。而打、砸、抢、抄、抓的办法，是根本不可能解决这个问题的。
    对待自己的同志，对待革命群众组织，对待保守组织中受蒙蔽的群众，更不容许采取打、砸、抢、抄、抓的办法，而必须坚持“团结——批评——团结”的方针，坚持做耐心细致的政治思想工作。这样，才能解决矛盾，消除分歧，统一思想，团结对敌。毛主席最近指示我们：凡属两派革命群众组织互相对立很严重的，只要进行细致的政治思想工作，问题总是可以解决的。至于有群众的保守组织，甚至于反动组织，也要进行细致的政治思想工作。我们一定要牢牢记住和坚决贯彻毛主席的这个指示。
    无产阶级革命派在被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派压制的时候，要推翻他们的反动统治，必须用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的方法，充分揭露他们的反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。无产阶级革命派掌权之后，还要继续运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的方法，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批深、批透，彻底肃清他们在各个方面的流毒，从而教育群众，促进人的思想革命化。
    无产阶级革命派，应当成为运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的方法进行革命的模范，成为自觉地维护无产阶级专政权威的模范，成为遵守无产阶级革命纪律的模范，成为执行党和国家政策的模范，成为掌握斗争大方向的模范。同时，无产阶级革命派有了缺点错误，要认真地做自我批评，也要允许别人批评自己，而不能因为自己掌了权，就去压制别人。
    是坚持大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论，还是搞打、砸、抢、抄、抓，这不仅仅是一个简单的方法问题，作风问题，而是无产阶级文化大革命沿着什么道路前进的根本问题，是遵循不遵循马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的问题，是坚持不坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的问题。
    一切革命的同志，革命的群众组织，必须百倍地提高警惕，坚决反对和制止打、砸、抢、抄、抓的歪风，运用无产阶级专政下进行革命的正确方法，抓住主要矛盾，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，彻底打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
