In the midst of revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary workers on Qingdao's industrial and transportation fronts have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," and in the course of deeply carrying out the struggle and criticism against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, have exceeded the national plan for the first half of the year by 4%.

According to statistics, the total industrial output value completed in the city for the first half of this year has increased by more than 22% compared to the same period last year. This is the year with the largest growth rate in recent years. Fifty-eight major products have all increased to varying degrees, and the quality of most major products has been stabilized and improved. The consumption of raw materials and costs have both been reduced. The achievements in industrial production for the first half of the year have laid a solid foundation for completing and exceeding the national plan for the entire year.

Qingdao's proletarian revolutionaries have resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "be thrifty and make revolution," and in the first half of the year's industrial production, have extensively carried out mass campaigns to save coal, water, electricity, timber, and metal materials, known as the "five savings" campaign. This has powerfully promoted the over-fulfillment of the production plan for the first half of the year.

　　在革命的大批判中超额完成国家计划
    青岛工业产值大幅度增长
    据新华社济南二日电　青岛市工业交通战线上的广大无产阶级革命派和革命职工，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻执行毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针，在深入开展向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争中，超额百分之四完成了上半年的国家计划。
    据统计，今年上半年全市完成的工业总产值比去年同期增长百分之二十二以上，这是近几年来增长幅度最大的一年。五十八种主要产品都有不同程度的增长，大部分主要产品质量稳定提高，原料材料消耗和成本都有所降低。上半年工业生产上的这一成就，为完成和超额完成全年国家计划打下良好的基础。
    青岛市无产阶级革命派坚决响应毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大号召，在上半年的工业生产中，广泛开展群众性的节约煤、水、电、木材、金属材料的“五节”活动，有力地推动了上半年生产计划的超额完成。
