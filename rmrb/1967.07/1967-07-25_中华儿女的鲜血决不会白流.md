The true extent of the massacre of Chinese nationals by the Ne Win reactionary government in Burma has been further exposed. From June 26 to 28, within just three days, the Ne Win reactionary government organized tens of thousands of thugs to beat to death hundreds of our patriotic overseas Chinese, arrest thousands, and burn countless homes and shops of overseas Chinese. The methods used by these fascist thugs in slaughtering Chinese nationals are extremely brutal and shocking. The Chinese people, filled with indignation, denounce to the world the bloody crimes committed by the Ne Win reactionary government. This debt of blood must be repaid!

The Ne Win clique, in this inhumane massacre, openly mobilized its so-called "Socialist Program Party" members, and even released Kuomintang bandits to act as their henchmen. This is a shameful performance of Ne Win's "socialism." What "Socialist Program Party"? It is clearly a gang of bandits!

The Ne Win reactionary government committed such horrifying atrocities and yet still claims that its actions were "reasonable," "restrained," and "moderate." This is the height of shamelessness.

The Ne Win reactionary government's ruthlessness and madness only show that this gang of fascist bandits is terrified of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the great thought of Mao Zedong. It also reflects their extreme fear of the growing revolutionary forces of the Burmese people. This reactionary regime is on its last legs and senses that its end is near.

In the face of the savage and brutal fascist executioners, our patriotic overseas Chinese stood firm, fearless, and unyielding. Many of them sacrificed their lives in heroic struggles. These outstanding sons and daughters of our motherland have shown the great heroic spirit of the Chinese nation.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the history of mankind, all reactionary forces that are about to perish will make their last struggles against the revolutionary forces," and "In the face of beasts, one must not show the slightest cowardice." It is precisely these teachings of our great leader that have made our patriotic overseas Chinese fearless, willing to sacrifice, and daring to defy the most vicious enemies. Their heroic struggles have once again proven that the Chinese people, armed with the invincible thought of Mao Zedong, are fearless. This overwhelming spiritual force makes all reactionaries tremble with fear.

The patriotic overseas Chinese held high portraits of Chairman Mao and the five-star red flag, fighting against the thugs; they shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" and sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations as they bravely sacrificed their lives. These magnificent scenes fully demonstrated their boundless love and loyalty to the motherland and the great leader Chairman Mao.

Countless martyrs have sacrificed their lives for the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Now, these patriotic overseas Chinese have written new chapters in the great revolutionary epic with their blood.

The patriotic overseas Chinese living in Burma have long lived and struggled together with the Burmese people. Now, as the Ne Win reactionary government is engaged in a frenzied counter-revolutionary civil war, it has raised the knife against the patriotic overseas Chinese. The blood of the Chinese people and the Burmese people has once again been shed together. These compatriots who fought bravely against the Ne Win fascist bandits and sacrificed their lives will forever live in the hearts of the people of China and Burma. Their blood will not be shed in vain. Their heroic deeds will further inspire the revolutionary will of the Chinese people and also encourage the revolutionary struggle of the Burmese people. From the bloody events created by the Ne Win reactionary government, millions of Burmese people will further understand: if you pick up the knife, we will also pick up the knife. Only by insisting on the armed struggle of the people can we achieve our liberation. The thoroughly reactionary and savage Ne Win reactionary regime will inevitably perish in the revolutionary storm of the Burmese people!

    中华儿女的鲜血决不会白流

    缅甸奈温反动政府对华侨进行大屠杀的真实情况，已经进一步地被揭露出来。从六月二十六日至二十八日，在三天之内，奈温反动政府就组织几万暴徒，打死了我几百名爱国侨胞，逮捕了上千华侨，烧毁了不计其数的华侨住房和店铺。这些法西斯暴徒残杀华侨，其手段之野蛮残暴，令人发指。中国人民怀着无比的愤怒，向全世界控诉奈温反动政府的这一血腥罪行。这笔血债一定要讨还！
    奈温集团在这个惨绝人寰的大屠杀中，公然出动了它的所谓“社会主义纲领党”的党徒，甚至放出蒋介石匪帮分子来充当打手。这是奈温牌的“社会主义”的一次可耻的大表演。什么“社会主义纲领党”？！明明就是一伙不折不扣的土匪党！
    奈温反动政府干下了这样骇人听闻的兽行，居然还口口声声地宣称它的行动是什么“讲理”、“克制”、“温和”的。简直是无耻之尤。
    奈温反动政府这样穷凶极恶，丧心病狂，不过是表明了这一伙法西斯土匪对于中国的无产阶级文化大革命和伟大的毛泽东思想怕得要死，同时也反映了他们对于日益发展壮大的缅甸人民革命力量极端恐惧。这个反动小王朝已是日暮途穷，预感到自己的末日快要来临了。
    在野蛮残暴的法西斯刽子手面前，我爱国侨胞，临危不惧，宁死不屈，许多人在英勇战斗中壮烈牺牲。我们祖国的这些优秀儿女，表现出了中华民族伟大的英雄气概。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”，“在野兽面前，不可以表示丝毫的怯懦。”正是我们伟大领袖的这些教导，使我们的爱国侨胞勇气百倍，不怕牺牲，敢于蔑视最凶恶的敌人。他们的英勇斗争，再一次证明，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是无所畏惧的。这种压倒一切的精神力量，使一切反动派为之胆战心惊。
    爱国侨胞高举毛主席画像和五星红旗，同暴徒展开搏斗；高呼“毛主席万岁！”和高唱毛主席语录歌英勇殉难，这些壮丽的场面，充分表现了他们对祖国和伟大领袖毛主席的无比热爱和无限忠诚。
    无数的先烈为了中国革命和世界革命事业献出了生命，现在，这些爱国侨胞又以自己的鲜血为伟大的革命史诗，写下了新的篇章。
    居住在缅甸的爱国华侨，长期以来就同缅甸人民生活在一起，斗争在一起。现在，奈温反动政府在疯狂进行反革命内战的同时，向爱国华侨举起了屠刀，中华民族的儿女同缅甸人民的鲜血又一次流在一起。这些同奈温法西斯匪徒进行了英勇搏斗而壮烈牺牲的我国侨胞，将永远活在中缅两国人民的心中。他们的血是不会白流的。他们大无畏的英雄事迹，将更加激励中国人民的革命意志，也将鼓舞缅甸人民的革命斗争。从奈温反动政府制造的这些血腥事件中，千千万万的缅甸人民将进一步懂得：你拿起刀来，我也要拿起刀来。只有坚持人民的武装斗争，才可以取得自己的解放。反动透顶、野蛮透顶的奈温反动小王朝，必然要在缅甸人民的革命怒涛中宣告灭亡！
