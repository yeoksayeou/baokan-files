    Puerto Rican People Oppose Being Used as American Cannon Fodder
    Some political parties, patriotic progressives, and broad masses of youth in Puerto Rico are increasingly strongly opposing the U.S. imperialists' forcible sending of Puerto Rican youth to Vietnam to be cannon fodder in its war of aggression against Vietnam. The Puerto Rican Socialist League recently called on Puerto Rican workers, peasants, students, and intellectuals to unite and launch a nationwide action to protest against the "compulsory military service" that the U.S. is using to recruit cannon fodder. They also called for demonstrations in front of U.S. military recruitment stations.

    Meanwhile, Puerto Rican youth are expressing their firm opposition to being used as cannon fodder in the U.S. war of aggression against Vietnam. They are continuously holding demonstrations and protests against U.S. imperialism's aggression against Vietnam.

    West German Economic Difficulties Lead to Fierce Infighting Among Ruling Class
    The economic situation in West Germany is deteriorating rapidly, leading to serious financial difficulties for the Bonn government. The Kiesinger government, which has been in power for more than seven months, is deeply troubled by this situation, and infighting within the ruling class has become fierce as they try to shift blame.

    The overall economic situation in West Germany is worsening, leading to a significant reduction in government revenue. The West German government, in order to maintain a large military and expand abroad, is continually increasing government expenditures. The budget for 1967, which was recently passed, has increased total expenditures by 8.3 billion marks compared to the previous year. This situation has led to a huge budget deficit in West Germany.

    The financial difficulties of the West German government are also evident in the ever-increasing national debt. By the end of last year, the total national debt of West Germany had reached 36.5 billion marks. (According to Xinhua News Agency)

    西德经济困难统治集团争吵激烈

    西德的整个经济情况越来越糟，使政府的收入大大减少。西德政府为了维持庞大的军队和对外扩张，不断增加政府开支。不久前通过的一九六七年度预算，支出总和又比上一年度增加了八十三亿马克。这种情况使得西德的财政出现巨额赤字。
