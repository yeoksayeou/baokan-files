Honorably returned Chinese red diplomats held a press conference with domestic and foreign journalists. They angrily denounced the Indian reactionary government's frenzied anti-China crimes and enthusiastically hailed the Indian people taking up arms to make revolution.

According to Xinhua News Agency, July 6th, "The thunder of revolutionary armed struggle in the Darjeeling region of India has shaken the land of India and will surely promote the development of the Indian revolution. This is a victory of the combination of Mao Zedong Thought and Indian revolutionary practice." Honorably returned red diplomats, First Secretary Chen Lu and Third Secretary Xie Chenghao of the Chinese Embassy in India, and other comrades, enthusiastically hailed the Indian revolutionary people firing the first shot of armed revolution at a press conference with domestic and foreign journalists held in Beijing today.

Chen Lu and Xie Chenghao were expelled from India by the Indian government without reason. Despite not yet recovering from their injuries, the other seven comrades who were severely beaten by Indian reactionary instigated thugs for protecting the Chinese national flag also participated in the press conference with domestic and foreign journalists.

The Indian reactionary clique's frenzied anti-China actions are a desperate struggle

At the press conference with domestic and foreign journalists, Chen Lu angrily denounced the Indian reactionary government's organization of thugs to frenziedly attack the Chinese Embassy in India, insult our great leader, seize and tear up our national flag, and brutally beat eight of our diplomatic personnel. Chen Lu, pointing to the blood-stained clothes of the injured Chinese diplomats, the weapons used by the Indian thugs during the attack stained with blood, and the photos taken after the red diplomats were injured, sternly pointed out: The bloody atrocity created by the Indian reactionary government is unprecedented in the history of international relations, with ironclad evidence that cannot be denied.

Chen Lu pointed out that the Indian reactionary government's creation of this fascist anti-China incident is not accidental. It is a part of the current imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary anti-China wave in the international arena. He said, the great proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by our great leader Chairman Mao has shaken the world with unparalleled power. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought illuminates the path forward for the people of the world. Revolutionary people are rising up to rebel against imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of all countries. These dregs of humanity, imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, are increasingly feeling their doom is near. They are struggling desperately, colluding with each other, and trying to find a way out through anti-China actions. He pointed out that the Indian reactionary clique is one of these dregs. They have long followed the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists, acting as anti-China clowns. They have launched this new wave of anti-China actions entirely to suit their domestic and foreign policy needs.

The spark in the Darjeeling region is the prelude to violent revolution

Chen Lu and Xie Chenghao enthusiastically hailed the armed struggle of the Indian revolution that has already ignited at the press conference. They said, the revolutionary faction of the Indian Communist Party and the Indian revolutionary people, inspired by the Chinese proletarian cultural revolution, have recognized in their struggles that the "parliamentary road" and "peaceful transition" are all deceptive narcotics. They have smashed the shackles of the "parliamentary road" and "Gandhism," and are fiercely rebelling against imperialism, revisionism, and the Indian reactionary government, which represents all reactionary classes in India. They have recognized in their struggles that the path of armed struggle is the only victorious path for the liberation of the Indian people. The thought of armed struggle by Chairman Mao is increasingly taking root in the hearts of the Indian people.

Chen Lu said, the armed struggle of revolutionary peasants in the Darjeeling region of India is the prelude to the violent revolution of the billions of suffering Indian people, representing the great direction of the struggle of the Indian people, and is the result of the resolute struggle between the revolutionary faction of the Indian Communist Party and the Indian Communist Party's revisionist clique. Revolutionary people around the world are enthusiastically hailing the rise of armed struggle in the Darjeeling region. He said, the Indian reactionary clique and the Danji traitor clique are in cahoots, trying to sabotage the armed struggle in the Darjeeling region, which is a futile attempt. The armed struggle in the Darjeeling region will surely promote the Indian revolution under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought to achieve even greater victories.

The Indian people have boundless love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought

Chen Lu and Xie Chenghao, in answering questions, introduced the situation of the Indian people's boundless love for Chairman Mao and their boundless faith in Mao Zedong Thought. They said, in India, revolutionary people and many progressive publications enthusiastically praise Chairman Mao as the greatest Marxist of the contemporary era, the most reliable great leader of the people of the world, the Lenin of the contemporary era, and the guarantee of victory. The Indian revolutionary people are eagerly and seriously studying the works of Chairman Mao. Many Indian revolutionary masses are translating and publishing "Quotations from Chairman Mao" in various languages. Many brilliant works of Chairman Mao, such as "In Memory of Norman Bethune," "Serve the People," "On Protracted War," "The Foolish Old Man Who Removed the Mountains," "Talks at the Yenan Forum on Literature and Art," "Rectify the Party's Style of Work," "Oppose Liberalism," "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party," "Where a Battle Line for Life and Death Is Drawn," "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," "Oppose Book Worship," as well as Chairman Mao's works on military affairs, have all been published in different languages. These books are in short supply, and some people, unable to buy them, make copies themselves. Study groups for Chairman Mao's works are springing up like bamboo shoots after a rain. The Indian revolutionary people are studying Chairman Mao's books and striving to combine them with Indian revolutionary practice. More and more Indian people are following the path of Mao Zedong Thought, fiercely rebelling against the reactionaries, and striving for the thorough liberation of the Indian people.

Chen Lu revealed in his speech that the Indian reactionary clique has long acted as a running dog for American imperialism and Soviet revisionism in their anti-China actions, closely coordinating with the anti-China actions of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism. Chen Lu pointed out that the Indian revolutionary people see clearly that the Soviet revisionists are the butchers helping the Indian reactionary clique suppress the Indian people's revolutionary movement. They are increasingly recognizing that to oppose imperialism, one must oppose revisionism, and to oppose the reactionary clique in one's own country, one must oppose revisionism.

Chen Lu strongly condemned at the press conference that the Indian reactionary government, because Lu Guanshan's spy crimes in China were exposed, deliberately and step-by-step launched an anti-China wave. He strongly condemned the Indian reactionary government for then, on trumped-up charges, declaring that it did not recognize the diplomatic status of Chinese diplomat Xie Chenghao, declaring him a "persona non grata." He said, Chinese diplomatic personnel are nurtured under Mao Zedong Thought, their behavior is upright, in accordance with international law and international customs, and in line with diplomatic status, beyond reproach. The Indian reactionary government cannot provide any factual evidence for the charges it has arbitrarily imposed on Chinese diplomatic personnel, which proves that its accusations are purely fabricated and a very despicable tactic. The Indian reactionary government's attempt to cover up Lu Guanshan's spy activities in China with despicable means is completely futile.

Diplomats nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought are not to be insulted

Chen Lu introduced the deeds of the staff of the Chinese Embassy in India, who held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and conducted a heroic struggle against violence. He said, the reason we were able to achieve victory in this struggle is that truth is on our side, and we are the revolutionary faction armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In our struggle against violence, we firmly remember the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings: "The Chinese nation has the spirit to fight to the death with its enemies," "Resolutely decide, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." In our struggle against violence, we shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" We thought of our great leader Chairman Mao, the dignity and honor of the motherland.

When Chen Lu, Xie Chenghao, and the other seven red diplomats, Shen Ganbei, Zhang Deliang, Li Zhaoqian, Liu Zhongfu, Hong Chuanjia, Li Siheng, and Wang Liren, were introduced to the domestic and foreign journalists, they received a warm round of applause.

Representatives from the capital's colleges and universities' Red Guards Congress, middle school Red Guards Congress, workers' congress, and some Red Guards newspapers' reporters, as well as reporters from the capital's news agencies, expressed strong protests against the fascist atrocities of the Indian reactionary government when asking questions. They enthusiastically praised the heroic and tenacious fighting spirit of our red diplomats and enthusiastically hailed the Indian revolutionary people beginning to take the path of armed struggle under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. They expressed their resolute support for the armed struggle led by the Indian revolutionary faction and firmly believed that they would surely achieve final victory.

The Albanian journalist stationed in Beijing and other foreign journalists attending the press conference also expressed respect to our red diplomats in their questions.

　　光荣归来的我红色外交战士举行中外记者招待会
　　愤怒控诉印度反动政府疯狂反华罪行
　　热烈欢呼印度人民拿起枪杆子闹革命
    据新华社六日讯　“印度大吉岭地区革命农民武装斗争的惊雷，震动了印度的大地，必将推动印度革命的发展。这是毛泽东思想和印度革命实践结合的胜利。”光荣归来的红色外交战士、我国驻印度大使馆一等秘书陈鲁直和三等秘书谢承浩等同志，今天在北京举行的中外记者招待会上，热烈地欢呼印度革命人民打响了武装革命的第一炮。
    陈鲁直和谢承浩是被印度政府无理驱逐回到祖国的。由于保护我国国旗而被印度反动派唆使暴徒殴打受重伤的其他七位同志虽然伤未痊愈，今天也参加了中外记者招待会。
    印度反动派疯狂反华是进行垂死挣扎
    在中外记者招待会上，陈鲁直愤怒控诉了印度反动政府组织暴徒疯狂袭击中国驻印度大使馆，侮辱我们伟大的领袖；劫走和撕毁我国国旗，并野蛮打伤我八名外交人员的法西斯暴行。陈鲁直指着在会上展出的被打伤的我外交人员的血衣和沾满血迹的印度暴徒行凶时的凶器以及我红色外交战士受伤后拍的照片，严正指出：印度反动政府一手制造的国际关系史上罕见的血腥暴行，铁证如山，不容抵赖。
    陈鲁直指出，印度反动政府一手制造这次法西斯反华事件绝非偶然。这是当前帝、修、反在国际上掀起的反华浪潮的一个组成部分。他说，我们伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，以无比的威力震撼了全世界。战无不胜的毛泽东思想照亮了全世界人民前进的道路，革命人民纷纷起来造帝国主义的反，造现代修正主义的反，造各国反动派的反。帝、修、反这些人类的渣滓越来越感到他们的末日到了，他们要进行垂死的挣扎，他们串通一起，妄想从反华中找到一条出路。他指出，印度反动派就是这样的一些渣滓，它们长期以来追随美帝、苏修，充当反华小丑，它们掀起这次新的反华浪潮，完全是为了适应它的内政外交的需要。
    大吉岭地区星星之火是暴力革命的先声
    陈鲁直和谢承浩在招待会上为已经燃烧起来的印度革命的武装斗争的烈火热烈欢呼。他们说，印度共产党革命派和印度革命人民在中国无产阶级文化大革命的鼓舞下，在斗争中认识了“议会道路”“和平过渡”都是骗人的麻醉剂。他们粉碎了“议会道路”、“甘地主义”的种种枷锁，大造帝国主义的反，大造修正主义的反，大造印度一切反动阶级的总代表印度反动政府的反。他们在斗争中认识到武装斗争的道路是印度人民解放的唯一胜利道路。毛主席的武装斗争的思想在印度越来越深入人心。
    陈鲁直说，印度大吉岭地区革命农民的武装斗争，是亿万苦难深重的印度人民进行暴力革命的先声，是代表着印度人民斗争的大方向，是印度共产党革命派与印共修正主义者进行坚决斗争的结果，全世界革命人民都在热烈欢呼大吉岭地区农民武装斗争的兴起。他说，印度反动派和丹吉叛徒集团狼狈为奸，企图破坏大吉岭地区的武装斗争，那是痴心妄想。大吉岭地区的武装斗争，必将推动印度的革命在毛泽东思想指导下，取得更加伟大的胜利。
    印度人民无限热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想
    陈鲁直和谢承浩在回答问题时，介绍了印度人民无限热爱毛主席，无限信仰毛泽东思想的情况。他们说，在印度，革命人民和许多进步刊物都热情称颂毛主席是当代最伟大的马克思主义者，毛主席是世界人民最可信赖的伟大领袖，是当代的列宁，是胜利的保证。印度革命人民如饥如渴地认真学习毛主席著作。印度很多革命群众正在用各种不同的文字翻译出版《毛主席语录》。毛主席的许多光辉著作，如《为人民服务》、《纪念白求恩》、《愚公移山》、《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》、《反对自由主义》、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《被敌人反对是好事而不是坏事》、《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《反对本本主义》，以及毛主席关于军事方面的著作，都已用不同的文字出版。这些书都供不应求，有的人买不到就设法借来自己刻印。学习毛主席著作的小组也象雨后春笋一般地组织起来。印度革命人民学习了毛主席的书，并努力和印度的革命实际结合起来，越来越多的印度人民正沿着毛泽东思想的道路，大造反动派的反，争取印度人民的彻底的解放。
    陈鲁直在讲话中揭露说，印度反动派长期以来充当美帝、苏修反华走卒，是和美帝、苏修反华行动密切配合的。陈鲁直指出，印度革命人民看得很清楚，苏修是帮助印度反动派镇压印度人民革命运动的凶手。他们越来越清楚地认识到：反帝必须反修，反对本国反动派必须反对修正主义。
    陈鲁直在招待会上，强烈谴责印度反动政府因为鲁冠南在中国的间谍罪行被揭发而有计划有步骤地掀起了一股反华浪潮，强烈谴责印度反动政府接着以莫须有的罪名，宣布不承认他的外交官身份，宣布中国驻印度大使馆三等秘书谢承浩为“不受欢迎的人”。他说，中国外交人员是在毛泽东思想哺育下成长的，行为光明正大，合乎国际法和国际惯例，符合外交身份，无可非议。印度反动政府对它强加给中国外交人员的罪名提不出任何事实证据，这证明它的指责纯粹是捏造，是一种十分卑劣的手法。印度反动政府妄图用卑劣的手段来掩盖鲁冠南在中国的间谍行径，这完全是徒劳的。
    用毛泽东思想哺育起来的外交战士不可侮
    陈鲁直介绍了我驻印度大使馆工作人员，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，进行英勇抗暴斗争的事迹。他说，我们所以能够取得这场斗争的胜利，是因为真理在我们这一边，是因为我们是用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派。我们在抗暴斗争中，牢记伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“中华民族有同自己的敌人血战到底的气概”，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”我们在抗暴斗争中高呼：“毛主席万岁！”我们一心想念的是伟大领袖毛主席，是祖国的尊严和荣誉。
    在招待会上，当陈鲁直、谢承浩和其他七位红色外交战士沈干北、章德良、李兆乾、刘忠富、洪传家、李思衡、王里仁被介绍给中外记者的时候，他们受到了热烈的鼓掌欢迎。
    出席招待会的首都大专院校红代会代表、中学红代会代表、工代会代表和一些红卫兵报纸的记者以及首都新闻单位的记者，在提问题的时候对印度反动政府的法西斯暴行表示强烈抗议，热烈赞扬了我红色外交战士英勇顽强的斗争精神，热烈欢呼印度革命人民在毛泽东思想指引下开始走上武装斗争的道路。他们表示坚决支持印度革命派所领导的武装斗争，坚信他们一定会取得最后胜利。
    出席招待会的阿尔巴尼亚驻北京记者和其他外国记者，在提问中也向我红色外交战士表示敬意。
