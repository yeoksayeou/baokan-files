Twelve years ago, Chairman Mao taught us that: "The collectivization of agriculture is the direction for the 500 million peasants in the country." In 1958, Chairman Mao taught us that: "The people's commune is great." Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we have moved from organizing mutual aid teams and agricultural cooperatives to establishing people's communes, firmly taking the path of socialist collectivization.

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party has always opposed our great leader Chairman Mao, fought against Mao's revolutionary line, and viewed agricultural collectivization as a thorn in the eye and a splinter in the flesh. Soon after the founding of New China, he advocated for "long-term protection of the rich peasant economy" and "four freedoms"; during the high tide of agricultural collectivization, he advocated for "definite contraction" and slashed agricultural cooperatives; in collusion with imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries in their anti-China chorus, he grumbled about "the people's commune being established too early" and promoted "three autonomies and one contract." The root of the evil is that our production brigade once experienced a wind of "contracting production to teams, dividing land to households," and "livestock distribution, animals returning to their original owners," which was supported and instigated by this capitalist-roader in the Party. He is the backer of all ghosts and monsters attempting to restore capitalism in China.

Personal experience tells us that the capitalist road leads to a dead end, and the conspiracy of the Chinese Khrushchev to restore capitalism will never succeed. Living facts tell us that the socialist road is broad and getting broader, and the people's commune is great. Chairman Mao taught us: "The vast majority of peasants in the country, in order to get rid of poverty and improve their lives, and to withstand disasters, must unite and advance on the road to socialism to achieve their goals." It is by following the bright path indicated by Chairman Mao that we have carried out the struggle to change the world, developed the collective economy, and improved production levels. Since the establishment of the people's commune, the grain yield of our production brigade has exceeded the targets set in the "Agricultural Development Outline," more than doubling the output compared to before liberation and before the establishment of the primary cooperative. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, under the guidance of Chairman Mao on the socialist path, have seen their lives continuously improve, especially their socialist consciousness which has been continuously raised, ensuring that we advance victoriously along the revolutionary course opened up by Chairman Mao. The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party wants to suppress the socialist revolutionary movement, drag history backward, and abolish the people's commune, which is absolutely impossible!

A towering flag, the great flag bearer Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao, you lead us forward with the red flag, we will forever follow you! The sea may dry up, the rocks may crumble, but this red heart of walking the socialist path will never change!

    人民公社就是好
    于生智
    十二年前，毛主席教导我们说：农业合作化就是全国“五亿农民的方向”。一九五八年，毛主席教导我们说：人民公社好。遵照毛主席的教导，我们从组织互助组、农业合作社到成立人民公社，坚定地走上了社会主义集体化的阳关大道。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，一贯地同我们的伟大领袖毛主席唱反调，同毛主席的革命路线相对抗，把农业集体化看成眼中钉、肉中刺。新中国成立后不久，叫嚷“长期保护富农经济”、提倡“四大自由”的是他；农业合作化高潮时，主张“坚决收缩”、大砍农业合作社的是他；配合帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派反华大合唱，嘟囔“人民公社搞早了”，鼓吹“三自一包”的也是他。树有根，水有源，我们大队曾经一度刮起了“包产到组、分田到户”，“牲畜下放，畜归原主”的单干风，就是由党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派这个坏家伙支持和怂恿的。他是一切牛鬼蛇神妄图在中国复辟资本主义的总后台。
    亲身经历告诉我们，资本主义道路越走越窄，是死路一条，中国的赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的阴谋永远不会得逞。活生生的事实告诉我们，社会主义道路越走越宽，人民公社就是好。毛主席教导我们：“全国大多数农民，为了摆脱贫困，改善生活，为了抵御灾荒，只有联合起来，向社会主义大道前进，才能达到目的。”正是走上了毛主席指引的光明大道，我们才进行了改天换地的斗争，发展了集体经济，提高了生产水平。人民公社化以来，我们大队的粮食产量已经超过《农业发展纲要》的指标，比解放前和初级合作社前翻了一番还多。广大贫下中农在毛主席指引的社会主义阳关大道上，生活日益改善，特别是社会主义觉悟不断提高，保证了我们沿着毛主席开辟的革命航道胜利前进。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，妄想把社会主义革命运动打下去，把历史拉向后退，不要人民公社，这绝对办不到！
    顶天立地一杆旗，伟大的旗手毛主席。毛主席啊毛主席，您高举红旗头前引，我们永远跟着您！海可枯，石可烂，走社会主义道路的这颗红心，永远也不变！
