The Belgian Communist Party's organ, the weekly "Voice of the People," published an editorial on July 14, enthusiastically praising the Vietnamese people's brilliant victories in their struggle against American aggression for national salvation. The editorial also pointed out that only people's war is the path to liberation for the oppressed peoples.

The editorial, titled "The Invincible Power of People's War," detailed the failures of various tactics employed by the American aggressors on the battlefield in South Vietnam.

The editorial pointed out that from relying mainly on the puppet government and puppet army of South Vietnam in "special warfare" to the current large-scale involvement of U.S. aggressor troops, American imperialism is increasingly finding itself in a predicament in South Vietnam.

The editorial said: "The invincible power of people's war has clearly exposed the paper tiger nature of the biggest and most ferocious imperialism."

The editorial said: "It is precisely because the aggressors face the threat of complete failure in Vietnam that the conspirators in Glassboro, Johnson and Kosygin, have carefully studied the Vietnamese issue. These two individuals are terrified of the consequences of the Vietnamese people's victory, and they are desperately trying to mend the holy alliance of all reactionary forces in the world against communism, revolution, and the people, and are frantically plotting new peace talks to deceive the Vietnamese people."

The editorial said that all reactionaries, including the Soviet revisionists, are paper tigers who tremble in the face of the invincible power of people's war and are in a state of extreme panic over the victories achieved by the Vietnamese people.

The editorial pointed out that the Vietnamese people, like the Chinese people, have shown the path to liberation for all oppressed peoples. "This path is the path of armed struggle and people's war. It is leading imperialism and all its lackeys to a miserable defeat." "No force can extinguish the flames of armed struggle by the peoples of the world."

The editorial concluded by expressing that the Belgian people will uncompromisingly strengthen their active support for the Vietnamese people and contribute to the Vietnamese people's early and complete victory.

    比共《人民之声》赞扬越南人民抗美救国斗争取得辉煌胜利
    人民战争是被压迫人民解放的道路
    新华社布鲁塞尔十七日电　比利时共产党机关报《人民之声》周刊十四日发表社论，热烈赞扬越南人民在抗美救国斗争中取得的辉煌胜利，并且指出，只有人民战争才是被压迫人民解放的道路。
    这篇题为《人民战争的战无不胜的威力》的社论详细地叙述了美国侵略者在南越战场上各种战术的破产。
    社论指出，从主要依靠南越傀儡政府和伪军的“特种战争”到目前美国侵略军大规模参战，美帝国主义在南越战场上越来越处于困境。
    社论说：“人民战争的战无不胜的威力，再清楚不过地揭露了最大和最凶恶的帝国主义的纸老虎的原形。”
    社论说：“正因为侵略者在越南面临彻底失败的威胁，所以葛拉斯堡罗的共谋者约翰逊和柯西金才仔细研究越南问题。这两个人都对越南人民取得胜利的后果怕得要命，他们竭力想修补世界所有反动势力的反共、反革命和反人民的神圣同盟，并且疯狂地策划反对越南人民的新的和谈阴谋。”
    社论说，包括苏联修正主义者在内的所有反动派都是纸老虎，他们都在人民战争的不可战胜的威力面前发抖，对于越南人民取得的胜利恐慌万状。
    社论指出，越南人民同中国人民一样，指出了所有被压迫人民解放的道路。“这条道路就是武装斗争和人民战争的道路。它正使帝国主义及其一切走狗走向惨败。”“没有任何力量能够扑灭世界各国人民武装斗争的烈火。”
    社论最后表示，比利时人民将毫不妥协地加强对越南人民的积极支持，为越南人民提早取得彻底胜利作出贡献。
