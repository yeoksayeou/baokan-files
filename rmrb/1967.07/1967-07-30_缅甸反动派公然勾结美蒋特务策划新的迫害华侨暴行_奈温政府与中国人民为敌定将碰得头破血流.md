Committed to the bloodshed of the Burmese and Chinese peoples, the Ne Win reactionary clique is hastening to plot new anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities.

The Ne Win reactionary government, in order to restrict the normal activities of the Chinese Embassy in Burma and sever the ties between overseas Chinese and the Chinese Embassy, has since June 28 imposed a blockade on the Chinese Embassy. Not only has this blockade not been lifted, but it has instead been tightened. At present, four of the roads around the Chinese Embassy have been sealed off with barbed wire by the Burmese reactionary government, and the remaining sole exit has been blocked. The Burmese reactionary military and police, in addition to setting up a police car station opposite the Chinese Embassy, have also set up a police car shed with three police cars constantly stationed inside the barricade at this sole exit. Whenever a car from the Chinese Embassy goes out, police cars immediately follow. When personnel from the Chinese Embassy get out of the car, plainclothes spies from the police cars follow and monitor them. More plainclothes spies have also been deployed around the Chinese Embassy.

At the same time, the Ne Win reactionary government is colluding with the U.S. Information Agency and Kuomintang spies to compile lists of patriotic overseas Chinese in areas where overseas Chinese reside, preparing to carry out mass arrests, kidnappings, and assassinations of patriotic overseas Chinese. Kuomintang spies who previously carried out espionage activities in Burma have recently returned to Rangoon from Taiwan and are intensifying their collusion with the Burmese reactionary government to plot anti-China and anti-Chinese conspiracies.

The Ne Win reactionary government is also continuing to organize thugs and Kuomintang elements to hold anti-China parades nationwide and to organize so-called "loyalty to the Ne Win government" rallies in some cities near China. In recent days, some places have also held so-called "Sino-Burmese Friendship Meetings," where the Burmese reactionary government has allowed Kuomintang elements to viciously attack the People's Republic of China at these meetings, which are mainly attended by Kuomintang elements.

The Ne Win reactionary government, which is insane, is facing a dire situation both internally and externally. It attempts to shift the attention of the Burmese people from the increasingly sharp class struggle within the country by carrying out larger-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese activities to cater to the needs of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, so as to get itself out of the predicament. However, it must be pointed out that its conspiracy will never succeed. We must warn the Ne Win reactionary government that the seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with, and all anti-China clowns will not have a good ending. If the Ne Win reactionary government insists on its own way, it will only end up hurting itself.

    缅甸反动派公然勾结美蒋特务策划新的迫害华侨暴行
    奈温政府与中国人民为敌定将碰得头破血流
    新华社二十九日讯　仰光消息：双手沾满了缅甸和中国人民鲜血的奈温反动集团，正在加紧策划新的反华排华暴行。
    奈温反动政府为了限制中国驻缅甸大使馆的正常活动，割断华侨同中国使馆的联系，在六月二十八日开始对中国大使馆实行的封锁至今不但没有解除，相反却更加严密。目前，中国大使馆周围的四个路口都被缅甸反动政府用铁丝网封锁，剩下的唯一出口也设置了路障。缅甸反动军警除在中国大使馆对面设有警车处以外，还在这个仅有的出口的路障内专门设置了一个经常保持有三辆警车的警车棚。每逢中国大使馆汽车外出，警车立即尾随，中国大使馆人员下车，警车里的便衣特务便下车跟踪监视。在中国大使馆周围还增派了更多的便衣特务。
    同时，奈温反动政府正勾结美国新闻处和蒋帮特务分子，在华侨居住地区搜集爱国华侨的名单，准备对爱国华侨进行大逮捕，绑架和暗杀。过去曾在缅甸进行特务活动的蒋帮特务，最近从台湾返回仰光，加紧同缅甸反动政府勾结策划反华排华的阴谋活动。
    奈温反动政府还继续组织暴徒和蒋帮分子在全国举行反华游行，在一些邻近中国的城镇组织了所谓“效忠奈温政府”的集会。过去几天，一些地方还举行了所谓“缅中友好集会”，缅甸反动政府让一些蒋帮分子放肆地在这些主要是蒋帮分子参加的集会上恶毒地攻击中华人民共和国。
    丧心病狂的奈温反动政府正在面临着内外交困的窘境。它企图通过更大规模的反华排华活动来转移缅甸人民对日益尖锐的国内阶级斗争的注意力，迎合美帝、苏修的需要，以便使自己能够摆脱困境。但是，必须指出，它的阴谋是绝对不会得逞的。我们要警告奈温反动政府，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是不可侮的，一切反华小丑都决不会有好下场。如果奈温反动政府一意孤行，那么，只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚。
