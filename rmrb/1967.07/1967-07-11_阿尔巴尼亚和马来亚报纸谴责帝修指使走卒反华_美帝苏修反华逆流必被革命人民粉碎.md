Albanian and Malayan Newspapers Condemn Imperialists and Revisionists for Instigating Anti-China Sentiment
U.S. and Soviet Revisionist Anti-China Tide Will Be Smashed by Revolutionary People

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, July 9th: The Albanian newspaper "Unity" published a short commentary on July 9th, strongly condemning the reactionary governments of India, Burma, and Indonesia for launching an anti-China wave recently under the instigation and support of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism.

	The commentary said, Johnson and Kosygin, during their secret talks in Glasburg, formulated a plan to collude against the revolutionary movements of the people of various countries. There is no doubt that their main target is the People's Republic of China and its 700 million people, because the People's Republic of China is the main obstacle to the imperialist and revisionist plan to dominate the world. Therefore, it is not surprising that after the talks between Johnson and Kosygin, in some countries and regions where the imperialists and Khrushchev revisionists are in power, such as India, Indonesia, and Burma, a large-scale anti-China movement has been launched.

	The commentary concluded by saying, just as in other places, the conspiracies of imperialism and revisionism in the Far East will surely fail. Those who are trying to encircle China with a ring of fire will be swallowed up by the revolutionary struggle that sweeps the world. China and the Chinese people are advancing to victory like a fearless giant facing the surging waves.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Singapore: The Malayan newspaper "Frontline News" recently published a commentary pointing out that the Burmese reactionary government's organized anti-China and anti-Chinese incidents are a serious provocation against the Chinese government and people. It is "a part of the anti-China, anti-revolutionary chorus of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, and a component of their conspiracy to resist the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought."

	The commentary said: The anti-China and anti-Chinese incidents in Burma occurred precisely when the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson and the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin had just finished their secret talks and were singing the praises of "joint action." It is connected with the U.S. and Soviet anti-China conspiracies. This is another counter-revolutionary action after the U.S. and Soviet instigated the Indonesian and Indian reactionaries to create anti-China and counter-revolutionary incidents.

	The commentary concluded by warning the Burmese reactionary government to stop immediately. If it continues to follow the U.S. and Soviet in their anti-China and anti-Chinese counter-revolutionary activities, it will not end well!

    阿尔巴尼亚和马来亚报纸谴责帝修指使走卒反华
    美帝苏修反华逆流必被革命人民粉碎
    据新华社地拉那九日电　阿尔巴尼亚《团结报》九日发表短评，强烈谴责印度、缅甸、印度尼西亚等国反动政府在美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的指使和支持下，最近掀起的反华逆流。
    短评说，约翰逊和柯西金在葛拉斯堡罗秘密会谈时，制定了相互勾结反对各国人民革命运动的计划。毫无疑问，他们的主要目的是反对中华人民共和国和七亿中国人民，因为中华人民共和国是帝国主义和修正主义主宰世界计划的主要障碍。因此，在约翰逊和柯西金会谈之后，在帝国主义者和赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的走狗当政的一些国家和地区，如印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸等，掀起大肆反华的运动，这是毫不奇怪的。
    短评最后说，象其它地方一样，帝国主义和修正主义在远东地区的阴谋必将破产。那些对中国拼凑火力包围圈的人，将被席卷全世界的革命斗争浪潮所吞没。而中国和中国人民正象无畏的巨人迎着惊涛骇浪胜利前进。
    据新华社讯　新加坡消息：在新加坡出版的马来亚报纸《阵线报》最近发表评论指出，缅甸反动政府有计划地制造疯狂的反华排华事件，是对中国政府和中国人民的严重挑衅，是“美帝苏修反华、反革命大合唱中的一个组曲，是它们企图抵制光辉的毛泽东思想的另一个阴谋的组成部分”。
    评论说：缅甸反华排华事件恰恰发生在美帝头目约翰逊和苏修头子柯西金密谈刚刚结束、美苏大唱“联合行动”的时候。它同美苏反华阴谋是有联系的。这是美帝和苏修在指使印尼、印度反动派制造反华反革命事件后的又一个反革命行动。
    评论最后警告缅甸反动政府立即悬崖勒马，如果还继续跟随美帝苏修进行反华排华的反革命活动，那是绝不会有好下场的！
