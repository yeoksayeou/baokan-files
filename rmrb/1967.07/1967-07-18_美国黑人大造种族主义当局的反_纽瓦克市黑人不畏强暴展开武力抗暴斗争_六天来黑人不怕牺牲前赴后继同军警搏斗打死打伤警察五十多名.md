Black Americans in Newark bravely resist brutal oppression and launch armed struggle against violence. For six days, black Americans fearlessly sacrifice themselves, fighting military and police, killing and injuring over fifty officers.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on July 17th, despite the bloody suppression by the racist authorities, black Americans in Newark, New Jersey, have been courageously and unyieldingly fighting back. According to incomplete statistics, by July 17th, the inhuman racist authorities had killed 22 protesting blacks, injured about 2,000, and arrested over 1,600. However, the black people of Newark have not been intimidated by the violence. For five days and nights, they have been tenaciously fighting back. They use self-defense weapons and homemade Molotov cocktails to strike at the rampaging military and police. Reports indicate that out of the 7,000 military and police sent to suppress the protests, two have been killed and over fifty injured.

Meanwhile, black protesters in the neighboring city of Plainfield have also been fighting military and police for three days, seizing many weapons for self-defense and killing a police officer who shot a black person, as well as injuring several white racists. Reports indicate that several towns near Newark, including Jersey City, and Des Moines in Iowa, have also seen black self-defense struggles in recent days. American bourgeois newspapers and news agencies are alarmed by the "serious" situation, and New Jersey Governor Hughes has expressed his "shock and disappointment" at the expansion of the black anti-violence struggle in Newark.

This large-scale anti-violence struggle began on the night of July 12th when a police officer beat and arrested a black person. From the start, the racist authorities adopted violent suppression tactics, attempting to crush the black protests. Over the past few days, the number of military and police involved in the suppression has increased from a few hundred to 7,000. They are equipped with various weapons, including armored vehicles and even helicopters. They have imposed a curfew on the entire city and used barbed wire to seal off more than half of the city and the roads leading to the suburbs. Especially in the black residential areas, they shoot indiscriminately and arrest anyone they see. However, this white terror has not intimidated the blacks. They have scattered and fought back from rooftops, windows, and corners, using guns, stones, and bottles to strike at the rampaging military and police. On July 17th, the mayor of Newark had to admit that after days of suppression, the "sniper attacks" against the military and police had become more severe. A report from United Press International on the same day stated that all the suppression measures taken by the authorities "have not been able to stop the ambushes" and that "black guerrilla fighters today have intensified their gun battles with the National Guard and police in Newark."

Governor Hughes of New Jersey, who personally directed the suppression, on one hand, viciously demanded the use of force to restore "law and order," threatening to "severely punish" and "shoot on sight" black snipers who resist the military and police. On the other hand, he sent many pastors, priests, and black elites to the black areas to persuade the protesters to "calm down." However, neither tactic has succeeded.

    美国黑人大造种族主义当局的反
    纽瓦克市黑人不畏强暴展开武力抗暴斗争
    六天来黑人不怕牺牲前赴后继同军警搏斗打死打伤警察五十多名
    据新华社十七日讯  纽约消息：美国新泽西州纽瓦克市黑人不顾种族主义当局的血腥镇压，英勇不屈地坚持暴力自卫斗争。据不完全统计，到十七日为止，灭绝人性的种族主义当局已经打死二十二名示威黑人，打伤约两千人，逮捕了一千六百多人，但是，纽瓦克市黑人不为暴力所屈服，他们五天五夜来一直在顽强地坚持斗争。他们用自卫枪支、自制燃烧瓶等到处打击行凶作恶的军警，据报道，前往镇压的七千名军警中已有两人被打死，五十多人被打伤。
    同时，邻近的普林菲尔德市的示威黑人，也已经同军警搏斗了三天之久，而且夺取了许多枪支进行自卫，打死了一名枪杀黑人的警察，打伤了一些白人种族主义者。据报道，距纽瓦克市不远的泽西市等几个市镇以及依阿华州的德缅因市，几天来也都相继爆发了黑人暴力自卫斗争。美国资产阶级报刊、通讯社纷纷惊呼局势“严重”，新泽西州州长休斯也表示对纽瓦克市黑人抗暴斗争的扩大感到“震惊和沮丧”。
    这场大规模的抗暴斗争，是十二日夜间由于一名警察殴打和逮捕一名黑人引起的。种族主义当局从一开始就采取了暴力镇压的手段，企图把黑人示威斗争压下去。几天来，进行镇压的军警已经由原来的几百人增加到了七千人，他们不仅配备了各种枪支，而且还有装甲车辆甚至直升飞机“助战”；他们在全市戒严，并且用铁丝网封锁了全市一半以上的地区以及通往四郊的路口；特别是在黑人聚居区，他们到处开枪，见人就逮。但是，这种白色恐怖并没有能吓倒黑人，他们化整为零，从房顶、窗后、墙角，用枪支、石块、玻璃瓶狠狠打击行凶军警。纽瓦克市市长十七日不得不承认，经过几天镇压，“（对军警的）狙击比以前更加严重了”。合众国际社同一天从现场发出的一条电讯也说，当局所采取的一切镇压措施“都没有能制止
  （对军警的）伏击”，“黑人游击战士今天更加紧了他们同纽瓦克市的国民警卫队和警察的枪战”。
    亲自指挥镇压的新泽西州州长休斯一面穷凶极恶地叫嚷坚决用武力来恢复“法律”和“秩序”，威胁要对抗击军警的黑人狙击手“严惩不贷”，“格杀勿论”；另方面，又派遣许多牧师、神父及黑人上层人物到黑人区去游说，让示威黑人“冷静下来”。但是，这两手都没有得逞。
