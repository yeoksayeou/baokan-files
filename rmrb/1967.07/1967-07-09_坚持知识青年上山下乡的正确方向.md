In 1955, our great leader Chairman Mao issued a call to arms to the youth: “All those intellectuals who can go to work in the countryside should gladly go there. The countryside is a vast expanse where there is great potential for achievement.”

Our country’s revolutionary youth have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao’s great call, filled with revolutionary fervor and determination. They carried Mao’s works, packed their bags, and, overcoming numerous obstacles, resolutely took the path of integrating with workers and peasants, going to the mountains and countryside, heading to the interior and the border regions. The practice of recent years has proven that these young intellectuals have not only played a significant role in the three great revolutionary movements of class struggle, production struggle, and scientific experimentation, but have also achieved results in transforming their subjective world and promoting ideological revolution. They have become an important shock force in China’s socialist revolution and socialist construction.

During the socialist education movement and the Cultural Revolution, revolutionary youth in the countryside have been at the forefront of denouncing the capitalist roaders within the Party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists. Together with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, they have become the vanguard of the Cultural Revolution in the countryside.

Sending urban youth to the countryside is not only a necessity for the socialist revolution and socialist construction but also an important way to cultivate and train successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution. Persisting in the correct direction of sending urban youth to the countryside and implementing Chairman Mao’s great strategic line of “preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people” are of great significance in narrowing the gaps between urban and rural areas, between workers and peasants, and between mental and physical labor. They are also crucial for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration.

Regarding the issue of sending urban youth to the countryside, there has long been a struggle between two lines within the Party. For a long time, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party has fiercely attacked Chairman Mao’s great instructions on intellectuals integrating with workers and peasants and seriously transforming their worldview. He has spread a lot of poison among the youth going to the countryside, peddling the idea of “suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage,” and attempting to lead the youth into the capitalist and revisionist quagmire.

Chairman Mao teaches us: “Serve the people wholeheartedly, never leave the masses; act in the interests of the people, not in the interests of individuals or small groups.” However, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party openly sings a different tune, vigorously promoting bourgeois individualism to the youth going to the countryside. He goes around “promising ranks and titles,” saying things like, “Seriously farm for three to five years, and by then you will have learned all the farming skills. You will be able to do anything a peasant can do, and even better, because you have culture, which peasants lack. With this advantage and good relations with the masses, you will have three conditions to become a cadre at the township, county, or provincial level, or even in the central government, depending on your abilities.” This is poisoning the youth, this is a bourgeois sugar-coated bullet.

A small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the ghosts and snakes in society are most afraid of the youth integrating with the poor and lower-middle peasants. Since the Cultural Revolution, they have politically persecuted the revolutionary youth who have risen up to oppose them in various ways. Particularly vicious is their attempt to sow discord between the youth and the poor and lower-middle peasants, using deception, bribery, and even withholding rations to incite large numbers of youth who have gone to the countryside to leave their production posts and rush to the cities. They aim to disrupt the Cultural Revolution and production, achieving their evil goals. All youth who have gone to the countryside and their families must be vigilant and resolutely smash the enemy’s sabotage plot.

All revolutionary youth must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, directing the spearhead of the struggle against the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party. They must thoroughly expose their plots to oppose Mao Zedong Thought and sabotage the revolutionary path of sending urban youth to the countryside, thoroughly criticize their entire set of revisionist goods, and persist in Chairman Mao’s proletarian revolutionary line and the correct direction of sending urban youth to the countryside. For cadres who handle the placement of youth going to the countryside, we should believe that most of them are good or relatively good, unite with them to make revolution, and help them do a better job. For those cadres who have made mistakes, we should patiently help them correct their errors, and absolutely not direct the spearhead of the struggle against them. Otherwise, it would divert the direction of the struggle and do things that would cause pain to friends and joy to enemies.

All youth who have gone to the countryside, border youth, and farm workers who are currently outside their units or lingering in cities should follow Chairman Mao’s great teachings and immediately return to their units, participate in the Cultural Revolution in the countryside, engage in the summer harvest battle, and do a good job in production.

Revolutionary youth returning to the countryside and returning to their production posts should unite with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, vigorously propagate Mao Zedong Thought, organize peasants to study and apply Chairman Mao’s works, and humbly learn from the poor and lower-middle peasants, serving the people wholeheartedly and forever being good children of the working people.

Some youth who have gone to the countryside may encounter practical difficulties upon returning to the countryside. How should we deal with these difficulties? Chairman Mao teaches us: “We work and struggle to solve difficulties. The more difficult the place, the more we should go there; this is what a good comrade should do.” In the face of difficulties, revolutionary youth should use this standard to demand of themselves, carry forward the spirit of hard struggle, constantly struggle against the “self” in their minds, proceed from the overall situation, and prioritize the interests of the Party and the people.

Revolutionary youth returning to the countryside is a revolutionary action. Revolutionary mass organizations in the cities, families of the youth, should firmly support them and help them quickly return to the countryside. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in the countryside should warmly welcome them and properly arrange their production and living conditions. For their specific difficulties in work and life, all those that should be solved and can be solved, relevant departments at all levels should actively help solve them. It is absolutely not allowed for the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in society to use any excuse to retaliate against the revolutionary youth returning to the countryside.

Chairman Mao said: “The broad revolutionary intellectuals in China should realize the necessity of integrating with the peasants. The peasants need them and are waiting for their help.”

All revolutionary youth who have gone to the countryside, your battle stations are in the countryside, where the Cultural Revolution and production need you. You should immediately respond to Chairman Mao’s great call to “grasp revolution and promote production,” return to the countryside, and make the Cultural Revolution and production in the countryside even better.

### 坚持知识青年上山下乡的正确方向

　　坚持知识青年上山下乡的正确方向
    一九五五年，我们伟大领袖毛主席向知识青年发出战斗号召：“一切可以到农村中去工作的这样的知识分子，应当高兴地到那里去。农村是一个广阔的天地，在那里是可以大有作为的。”
    我国广大革命知识青年，热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，满怀革命的豪情壮志，带着毛主席著作，打起背包，冲破重重阻力，坚定地走和工农相结合的道路，上山下乡，奔赴内地，奔赴边疆。几年来的实践证明，这些知识青年，不仅在阶级斗争、生产斗争和科学实验三大革命运动中，发挥了巨大的作用，而且在改造自己的主观世界，促进思想革命化方面，也取得了成效。他们已经成为我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设中的一支重要突击力量。
    在社会主义教育运动和无产阶级文化大革命中，革命知识青年在农村大造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，大造地富反坏右的反。他们同广大贫下中农一道，成为农村无产阶级文化大革命的先锋战士。
    知识青年上山下乡，既是社会主义革命和社会主义建设的需要，也是培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人的重要途径。坚持知识青年上山下乡的正确方向，贯彻毛主席提出的“备战、备荒、为人民”伟大战略方针，对于缩小城乡差别、工农差别、脑力劳动和体力劳动差别，对于巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟，都具有重大的意义。
    关于知识青年上山下乡的问题，党内一直存在着两条路线的斗争。长期以来，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，疯狂地攻击毛主席关于知识分子和工农相结合、认真改造世界观的伟大指示。他对上山下乡的知识青年，散布了大量的毒素，贩卖吃小亏占大便宜的生意经，妄图把知识青年引进资本主义、修正主义的泥坑。
    毛主席教导我们：要“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，却公然大唱反调，极力向上山下乡的知识青年宣扬资产阶级利己主义。他到处“封官许愿”，胡说什么“……认真地种三、五年地，到那时一切农活都学会了，农民能做的事，你们都能做，比任何农民都不差，你们有文化，农民没有，比农民多一条，再加上一条跟群众关系搞得好，具备三条，就能当乡、县、省干部，也可以到中央，那就看你各人的本事了。”这是向青年放毒，这是资产阶级的糖衣炮弹。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和社会上的牛鬼蛇神，最害怕知识青年和贫下中农相结合。无产阶级文化大革命以来，他们对起来造他们的反的革命知识青年，进行了种种政治迫害。特别恶毒的是，他们挑拨知识青年和贫下中农的关系，采取欺骗利诱、甚至克扣口粮等毒辣手段，煽动大批上山下乡知识青年，离开生产岗位，涌向城市，妄图以此达到他们破坏无产阶级文化大革命、破坏生产的罪恶目的。所有上山下乡的知识青年和他们的家属，必须擦亮眼睛，坚决粉碎阶级敌人的这一破坏阴谋。
    一切革命的知识青年，必须紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，把斗争的矛头集中地指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，彻底揭露他们反对毛泽东思想，破坏知识青年上山下乡的革命道路的阴谋活动，彻底批判他们的一整套修正主义货色，坚持毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，坚持知识青年上山下乡的正确方向。对于做知识青年上山下乡的安置工作的干部，应该相信他们大多数是好的和比较好的，应该团结他们一道干革命，应该协助他们把安置工作做得更好。对于一些犯过错误的干部，要耐心地帮助他们改正错误，而绝不能把斗争的矛头指向他们，否则，就会转移斗争大方向，就会做出亲者痛、仇者快的事情来。
    凡是现在还在外地串连和逗留城市的上山下乡知识青年、支边青年、农场职工，都要遵循毛主席的伟大教导，立即返回本单位，参加农村的无产阶级文化大革命，投入三夏战斗，搞好生产。
    革命知识青年返回农村，返回生产岗位，应当和广大贫下中农打成一片，大力宣传毛泽东思想，组织农民活学活用毛主席著作，并且虚心向贫下中农学习，完全、彻底地为人民服务，永远做劳动人民的好儿女。
    有些上山下乡的知识青年回到农村去，可能会遇到一些实际困难。怎样对待这些困难呢？毛主席教导我们：“我们是为着解决困难去工作、去斗争的。越是困难的地方越是要去，这才是好同志。”在困难面前，革命的知识青年应该用这个标准要求自己，发扬艰苦奋斗的作风，不断同自己头脑里的“私”字作斗争，从全局出发，以党和人民的利益为重。
    革命知识青年返回农村，是革命的行动。城市中的革命群众组织，知识青年的家属，应当坚决支持他们，帮助他们迅速返回农村。广大贫下中农和农村革命干部应当热烈地欢迎，妥善地安排他们的生产和生活。对于他们工作和生活上的具体困难，凡属那些应该解决而又能够解决的，各地有关部门，应该积极地帮助解决。绝对不允许党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和社会上的地富反坏右分子以任何借口，对重返农村的革命知识青年进行打击报复。
    毛主席说：“中国广大的革命知识分子应该觉悟到将自己和农民结合起来的必要。农民正需要他们，等待他们的援助。”
    一切要革命的上山下乡的知识青年们，你们的战斗岗位在农村，那里的无产阶级文化大革命需要你们，那里的生产需要你们。你们要立即响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，返回农村去，把农村无产阶级文化大革命和生产搞得好上加好。
