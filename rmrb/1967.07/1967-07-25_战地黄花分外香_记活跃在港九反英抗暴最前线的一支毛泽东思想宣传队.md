On June 10, eight hundred patriotic compatriots from more than ten villages in the Shatoujiao area of the New Territories held their first anti-British, anti-violence demonstration. That day, a group of young students studying in various parts of Hong Kong and Kowloon returned to their hometowns to join the struggle. These young students began to unite and organize in this struggle. They formed a frontline propaganda team and were active on the frontlines of the anti-British, anti-violence struggle. The leader of this team was a 16-year-old middle school student who was bravely injured during the anti-violence march on July 8.

On the first day of the team's establishment, the members gathered to study the teachings of the great leader Chairman Mao, swearing to follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao and to combine with the workers and peasants to play a vanguard role in the anti-British, anti-violence struggle. They decided to stay in their hometowns and fight resolutely against British imperialism with the masses.

After the propaganda team was established, quotations from Chairman Mao appeared everywhere in the streets of Shatoujiao. Anti-British, anti-violence leaflets and big-character posters increased rapidly. The team members also used paint to write large slogans such as "Patriotism is justified, resistance to violence is not a crime" in the middle of the roads. The British authorities were terrified of their revolutionary actions and often sent "riot control teams" in the middle of the night to secretly erase the slogans.

The team members remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Revolutionary war is the people's war. Only by mobilizing the people can we wage war, and only by relying on the people can we wage war." They followed Chairman Mao's teachings and went among the people to do in-depth political and ideological work. Every morning, they would rush to the Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee in Shatoujiao to gather, carrying leaflets, pictures, and big-character posters, going from village to village to propagate among the people, exposing the fascist crimes of British imperialism, and propagating Chairman Mao's great thought of daring to struggle and daring to win. Sometimes they would help the people with farm work, such as cutting rice or pushing carts, and use the breaks in labor to teach the people songs of Chairman Mao's quotations, distribute leaflets, and explain the content of anti-violence pictures to illiterate women. These propaganda activities ignited the patriotic compatriots' hatred of British imperialism and contempt for it, making the broad masses love their country and the great leader Chairman Mao even more.

The team members propagated the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, terrifying the enemy. British spies began to follow and surveil them. However, the patriotic youth armed with Mao Zedong Thought were fearless. They often used national righteousness to question the British spies, making these running dogs retreat in shame amidst the crowd's jeers.

The patriotic compatriots in various places in Shatoujiao loved these passionate patriotic youth. Whenever the propaganda team entered a village, the aunts and sisters would bring them tea and water, and even force them to take zongzi and fruits. The anti-imperialist and patriotic thoughts made the team members and the broad masses develop deep feelings and a common language. The team members exposed the bloody crimes of the British authorities in suppressing the people, and the elders told the propaganda team about the history of the people of Shatoujiao's struggle against the British. In Gupu, a woman cried as she told the propaganda team about her past experiences of being beaten by British imperialists and Japanese invaders, accusing them of generations of blood and tears. A mute candy seller wrote on the team members' hands, "We will not rest until we defeat the British imperialists!" An old lady in Nanchong called her child over and pointed to the propaganda team members, saying, "Look at how spirited they are. You should learn from them and overthrow British imperialism!" A mother in Shantou even sent her two daughters to the propaganda team, excitedly telling the team members, "If my children cannot resist British imperialism, what use are they!"

Under the leadership of the Shatoujiao Struggle Committee, the propaganda team was active day and night in the countryside and small towns, spreading the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, spreading the seeds of revolution, and inspiring the people's courage and confidence in struggle.

On June 24, Shatoujiao witnessed a moving anti-British, anti-violence struggle. The angry demonstrators fought fiercely with the British police "riot control teams," destroying two of the enemy's armored vehicles, burning a British police command car, and repelling the crazy provocations of more than a thousand "riot control teams." In this struggle, the propaganda team rushed to the frontlines. They argued with the demonstrators who were blocking the road:

"Why won't you let us pass?"

"Your gathering is illegal."

"What! Is it illegal for Chinese people to walk on their own land? Is it legal for the British to oppress us? Compatriots, charge!"

The propaganda team members shouted, and the crowd surged forward, scaring the "riot control teams" into retreating into the gate and locking the iron door.

A British head named Bowrich saw that things were not going well and put on a fake sympathetic smile, saying, "Hey, young people, I hope you don't get involved in political whirlpools."

"Nonsense! We are here to rebel against you imperialists! Why won't you let us pass?"

The British bandit put away his smile, waved his hand, and a black gun barrel emerged from the iron bars.

The British bandits began to suppress the demonstrators, and three "riot control vehicles" sped onto the road. At this moment, two sisters surnamed Xie immediately led ten rural women to face the "riot control vehicles." The twelve heroic women, filled with deep hatred for the enemy, swung their hoes at the car, shattering the headlights. The "riot control teams" on the car were stunned and found no countermeasures, forcing them to stop for nearly thirty minutes. The women's actions powerfully supported the struggle of the Shatoujiao people.

After the struggle ended, it was already dusk. The team members discovered that plainclothes spies were following them from behind. They knew that only by uniting could they have strength, and if they dispersed, they would be in danger of being arrested separately. They tried to find out the whereabouts of the committee members while retreating to the mountains. The spies threatened them, saying that all the committee members had been arrested and told them to go home quickly. The students ignored these hounds and continued forward. Along the way, the people cared for them deeply, changing their clothes to black, giving them canteens and biscuits, fruits, and guiding them up the mountain. When they reached the top of a mountain, it was already midnight, and it was pitch black all around, with rocks everywhere. These teenagers, only in their teens, were encountering such an environment for the first time. However, they faced their country, and a red sun rose in their hearts. They thought of the great leader Chairman Mao and read his teachings over and over again: "Our cause is just. A just cause can overcome any difficulty." They were full of fighting spirit and spent the night in the mountains. The next day, they finally made contact with the committee.

On July 8, when the team members learned that they would hold a meeting to support the Hong Kong and Kowloon patriotic workers' strike with their compatriots in the motherland, they were overjoyed. However, they also thought that there might be more brutal struggles. Before setting out in the morning, the young warriors expressed their determination to unite and fight to the end. One team member wrote in a letter to his mother, "Dear mother, for the dignity of the nation, to overthrow the hundred-year-old dark rule of the British authorities, to defend Mao Zedong Thought, if I sacrifice myself in the flames, please do not be sad. Be proud and proud of having such a son." At 8 a.m., the patriotic compatriots' parade had just returned to the New Territories when they were brutally suppressed by the British bandits. The first shot hit a young student at the front, and he fell to the ground in a pool of blood, bravely shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" The inhuman British bandits shot him several more times, injuring him in three places.

The British authorities' repeated brutal suppressions did not make these young warriors surrender. Instead, this propaganda team became stronger and more resolute in the fires of battle. Recently, they wrote a letter to their deputy team leader who was receiving medical treatment in the motherland, saying, "Your blood has given us a profound lesson. From you, we see that only by studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and following Chairman Mao's teachings can we, at critical moments, not disappoint the expectations of the people of our country. In the future, we will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, combine more closely with the workers and peasants, and, like you, always stand on the frontlines of the anti-British, anti-violence struggle, and be good children of the people of our country." This is the common will and determination of the team members.

    战地黄花分外香
    ——记活跃在港九反英抗暴最前线的一支毛泽东思想宣传队
    六月十日，九龙新界沙头角地区十多个村庄的八百名爱国同胞，举行了第一次反英抗暴示威游行。这天，在港九各地读书的一群青年学生回到家乡，参加了斗争行列。这些青年学生就在这场斗争中开始团结起来，组织起来。他们成立了一支火线宣传队，活跃在反英抗暴斗争的第一线。这个队的领导人就是七月八日抗暴游行中英勇负伤的一位十六岁的中学生。
    宣传队成立第一天，队员们就在一起学习伟大领袖毛主席的教导，宣誓要按照毛主席指出的道路，和工农群众相结合，在反英抗暴斗争中起先锋作用。他们决定留在家乡，同群众一起向港英帝国主义进行坚决的斗争。
    宣传队成立以后，沙头角地区街头上到处出现了毛主席语录。反英抗暴传单和大字报也迅速增多起来。宣传队员还用油漆在马路中心写上“爱国有理、抗暴无罪”等巨幅标语。港英当局对他们的革命行动怕得要死，常常在半夜以后派出“防暴队”去偷偷地把标语涂掉。
    宣传队员们牢记着毛主席的教导：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”他们按照毛主席的教导，到群众中去做深入的政治思想工作。每天天刚亮，他们就赶到沙头角地区反对港英迫害斗争委员会去集合，背起传单、图片、大字报，逐村逐户去向群众作宣传，揭露港英帝国主义的法西斯罪行，宣传毛主席敢于斗争、敢于胜利的伟大思想。他们有时和群众一起割稻、推车，帮助群众做家务劳动，利用劳动空隙，教群众唱毛主席语录歌，散发传单，并向不识字的妇女讲解抗暴图片的内容。这些宣传活动点燃了爱国同胞仇恨英帝国主义、蔑视英帝国主义的怒火，使广大群众更加热爱祖国、热爱伟大的领袖毛主席。
    宣传队员们宣传战无不胜的毛泽东思想，吓破了敌人的胆，港英特务们开始对他们跟踪盯梢。但是，用毛泽东思想武装起来的爱国青年天不怕，地不怕，他们常常用民族大义把港英特务质问得理屈词穷，这些走狗在群众一片斥责声中不得不夹起尾巴悄悄溜走。
    沙头角各地爱国同胞喜爱这些热血沸腾的爱国青年。宣传队一进村，大娘大嫂们就给他们送来茶水，还硬把粽子和水果塞到他们手里。爱国反帝的思想使队员和广大群众产生了深厚的感情和共同语言。队员们揭露了港英当局镇压群众的血腥罪行，老人们给宣传队讲述了沙头角人民反英斗争的历史。在谷埔，一位妇女流着泪，向宣传队讲述了她过去几次遭受英帝国主义者和日本侵略者毒打的情形，控诉了几代的血泪仇。一个卖蜜糖的哑子在队员手上写下了“不打倒英帝、决不罢休”的誓言。南冲一位老大娘把自己的孩子叫到跟前，指着宣传队员说：“你看他们多有志气，你们要向他们学习，把英帝国主义打倒！”担水坑一位母亲，更把自己一对亲生女儿送到宣传队，她激动地对队员们说：“我的孩子如果不能反对英帝国主义，那有什么用！”
    宣传队在沙头角斗委会领导下，日日夜夜地活跃在农村和小镇，传播战无不胜的毛泽东思想，传播革命的火种，鼓舞群众斗争的勇气和信心。
    六月二十四日，沙头角爆发了可歌可泣的反英抗暴斗争。愤怒的示威群众和英警“防暴队”展开了激烈的战斗，他们捣毁了敌人的两辆装甲车，烧毁了英警的指挥车，击退了一千多“防暴队”的疯狂挑衅。在这场斗争中，宣传队冲到最前线，他们和示威群众一起同封锁公路的“防暴队”展开了说理斗争：
    “为什么不让我们过去？”
    “你们的集会是非法的。”
    “什么！中国人在自己的土地上走路是非法的？英国佬欺压我们难道是合法的吗？同胞们，冲啊！”
    宣传队员们一声喊叫，群众呼地一下子冲了上去，那些“防暴队”吓得掉头跑进闸口，锁上铁门。
    港英警署一个叫鲍富达的英国籍头目一看不妙，装出一副假慈悲的笑脸走出来说：“喂，青年们，希望你们不要卷入政治的漩涡。”
    “胡说！我们就是要造你们这些帝国主义的反！凭什么不让我们通过？”这个英国强盗收起了笑脸，一摆手，乌黑的枪口从铁栏杆中伸了出来。
    英国强盗开始镇压示威群众了，公路上飞快地开来了三辆“防暴车”。这时，宣传队里两位姓谢的姊妹立即带着十名农村妇女，迎着“防暴车”走去。十二名英雄的妇女怀着对敌人的深仇大恨，抡起扁担向汽车砍去，只听得哗啦哗啦一阵响，车灯被砸破了，车上的“防暴队”傻了眼，一时找不出对策，被迫停车近三十分钟。妇女们这一行动有力地支援了沙头角群众的斗争。
    斗争结束以后，天已黄昏了，宣传队员们发现便衣特务已经在背后跟踪，他们知道只有团结起来才有力量，一分散就有分别被捕的危险。他们一面打听斗委会成员的下落，一面向山上撤退。特务们威吓他们说，斗委会的人全部被捕了，让他们赶快回家去。学生们不理这些鹰犬，继续前进。一路上，群众对他们十分爱护，帮他们换上黑色衣服，送给他们行军水壶和饼干、水果等，还为他们带路上山。他们到达一座山顶的时候，已经半夜了，四面一片漆黑，到处都是石头。这些只有十多岁的青少年，还是第一次遇到这样的环境，但是他们面向祖国，心中顿时升起了一轮最红最红的红太阳，他们想念着伟大的领袖毛主席，一遍又一遍地朗读着毛主席的教导：“我们的事业是正义的。正义的事业是任何敌人也攻不破的。”他们斗志昂扬，大家在山中过夜，第二天终于和斗委会取得了联系。
    七月八日，当宣传队员们知道要在祖国境内和祖国亲人共同召开支援港九爱国工人大罢工的大会时，心中无比高兴，但是他们也想到可能会有更残酷的斗争。早上出发前，年轻的战士们互相表示了团结一致、斗争到底的决心。有的队员在留给母亲的信中写道：“亲爱的妈妈，为了民族的尊严，为了推翻港英当局百年的黑暗统治，为了捍卫毛泽东思想，如若我在烈火中牺牲，请你不要悲伤，要为你有这样的儿子骄傲和自豪。”八日上午，爱国同胞的游行队伍刚刚返回新界，就遭到英国强盗的血腥镇压。第一次开枪，走在最前面的一位青年学生就被打倒在地。他躺在血泊里，英勇地不断高呼：“毛主席万岁！”惨无人道的英国强盗竟又对他连开几枪，使他全身三处负伤。
    港英当局一次又一次的血腥镇压，并没有使这些青年战士屈服，相反，这支宣传队在战火中更加壮大、更加坚强了。最近，他们给正在祖国医疗的副队长写了一封信，他们说，“你的血给了我们深刻的教育，从你的身上，我们看到只有活学活用毛主席著作，只有按照毛主席的教导去做，才能在关键时刻，不辜负祖国人民的期望。今后我们一定听毛主席的话，和工农群众进一步结合起来，象你一样，永远站在反英抗暴斗争最前线，做祖国人民的好儿女。”这就是宣传队员们共同的意志和决心。
