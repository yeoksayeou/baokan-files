The Preparatory Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee has decided to seriously study and resolutely implement the "Several Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Styles" issued by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee.

	New China News Agency, Hohhot, July 3 — The Preparatory Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee held a full meeting on June 30 and passed the "Decision on Seriously Studying and Resolutely Implementing the 'Several Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Styles' Issued by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee." The decision states:

	The "Several Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Styles" issued by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee is a highly important document that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. These regulations are a major measure to prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, establish revolutionary new customs, and maintain revolutionary youth. They are crucial issues related to whether we can implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, whether we can maintain our proletarian character, and whether we can prevent peaceful evolution and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat.

	Currently, the proletarian cultural revolution in Inner Mongolia faces a great and favorable situation. The Preparatory Committee of the Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee was recently established, and the proletarian revolutionary factions in the entire region have either already taken or are in the process of taking the leading position. We are preparing to complete arduous revolutionary tasks. Due to changes in the situation, position, and tasks, a series of new problems have been presented to the members of the Preparatory Committee and the leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations. In our work style, some trends worthy of attention have also emerged. The issuance of the "Several Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Styles" by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the publication of the editorial "Preventing the Infiltration of Bourgeois Ideology" by the Red Flag magazine have sounded an alarm for us in a timely manner. After studying and discussing the regulations at the full meeting of the Preparatory Committee, it was unanimously agreed that the "Several Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Styles" by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee are not only completely applicable to Inner Mongolia but also urgently needed. We must continue to carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian revolutionary factions, repeatedly study, resolutely implement, and seriously execute them. To this end, it is decided:

	1. To study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, to firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, to struggle hard against selfish and impure thoughts, and to diligently reform our worldview. Members of the Preparatory Committee and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations must be models of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works at all times, in all places, and in all matters. We must work hard on this. We must insist on studying every day, at least one hour each day, and two and a half days each week, persistently, and make it an unshakable system. We must fully mobilize the masses to push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, more solidly and deeply.

	2. Members of the Preparatory Committee and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations must emphasize proletarian politics, insist on the Four Firsts, promote the spirit of the May Fourth Movement, and grasp living thoughts. We must seriously grasp both ends: one end is to seriously study the latest and highest instructions of the great leader Chairman Mao and to timely study and implement measures for their execution; the other end is to timely grasp the dynamics of the masses' thoughts. We must combine both ends well, conduct political and ideological work in a detailed and thorough manner, timely analyze and study the situation of the proletarian cultural revolution in Inner Mongolia, and resolutely overcome and prevent the dangerous tendency of only focusing on work and neglecting ideology, burying oneself in affairs, and detaching from politics.

	3. Members of the Preparatory Committee and leaders of revolutionary mass organizations must never detach from the masses. We must believe in the masses, rely on the masses, and respect the masses' pioneering spirit. We must sincerely learn from the masses, be willing to be the masses' students, consult with the masses on matters, and establish a firm mass perspective. We must continuously go deep among the masses and into reality, go to the places where contradictions are most acute, and to the places where work is most difficult, to conduct investigations and studies, and help the masses solve ideological and practical problems. We must humbly listen to the masses' opinions, accept the masses' supervision and criticism. We must set aside a certain amount of time to personally receive visiting masses and personally handle letters from the masses. Members of revolutionary mass organizations participating in the Preparatory Committee must not detach from their original units. Members of the Preparatory Committee must periodically participate in manual labor, blend with the masses, share weal and woe, maintain the character of the working people, and resolutely oppose any form of bad work style that detaches from the masses.

	4. The Preparatory Committee must strengthen collective leadership and seriously implement the democratic centralism. Within the Preparatory Committee, we must fully carry forward democracy, frequently conduct small rectifications or heart-to-heart talks, and regularly carry out criticism and self-criticism; major issues must be decided after collective study, and personal decisions must be opposed; without collective discussion, members of the Preparatory Committee cannot arbitrarily represent the Preparatory Committee to give speeches; members of the Preparatory Committee must clearly divide responsibilities, cooperate closely, dare to take responsibility, bear heavy burdens, and boldly perform their duties.

	5. The office of the Preparatory Committee must definitely be streamlined, reduce levels, oppose bureaucratism, and establish revolutionary work systems and work styles. Members of the Preparatory Committee must implement a rotating duty system, with most members frequently going deep into the grassroots and getting close to the masses. Establish a system of joint offices for the responsible comrades of the Preparatory Committee office, implementing face-to-face leadership. Reduce meetings and reports, oppose long meetings, and do not hold unprepared meetings. Promote the revolutionary spirit of acting decisively and swiftly, and oppose the irresponsible bad style of being sluggish and dragging one's feet. We must continuously summarize experiences, break old frameworks, establish new systems, and new styles.

	6. We must carry forward the fine tradition of hard work and simplicity, be thrifty in all undertakings, oppose extravagance and waste, and oppose special treatment. We must be both "officials" and "common people," sincerely serve the people. We must not seek fame, not flaunt wealth, not accept banquets and gifts, not receive and send off guests, not take advantage of public property, not use public vehicles for private purposes, strictly abide by the state's financial system, and not issue unauthorized vouchers. We must always remember Chairman Mao's teachings and resolutely resist the assault of bourgeois sugar-coated bullets.

　　防止资产阶级思想侵蚀  树立无产阶级革命新风
　　内蒙古自治区革命委员会筹备小组关于认真学习和坚决贯彻《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》的决定
    新华社呼和浩特三日电　内蒙古自治区革命委员会筹备小组全体会议于六月三十日通过了《关于认真学习和坚决贯彻〈山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定〉的决定》，决定中说：
    《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》，是一个高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的极其重要的好文件。这个规定，是防止资产阶级思想侵蚀、树立革命新风、永葆革命青春的重大措施。是关系到能不能执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，关系到能不能保持无产阶级本色，关系到能不能防止和平演变，巩固无产阶级专政的重大问题。
    当前，内蒙古自治区无产阶级文化大革命面临一片大好形势。自治区革命委员会筹备小组在不久前成立了，全区无产阶级革命派已经或正在处于主导地位，艰巨的革命斗争任务准备着我们去完成。由于形势、地位、任务的改变，在筹备小组成员和各革命群众组织负责人面前，提出了一系列新的问题，在我们的作风方面，也出现了一些值得注意的苗头。《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》和《红旗》杂志评论员文章：《防止资产阶级思想侵蚀》的发表，给我们及时敲起了警钟。经筹备小组全体会议学习讨论，一致认为，《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》，对内蒙古自治区不仅完全适用，而且迫切需要。我们一定要继续发扬无产阶级革命派的革命精神，反复学习，坚决贯彻，认真执行。为此决定：
    一、活学活用毛主席著作，大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，狠斗私心杂念，刻苦地改造世界观。筹备小组成员和革命群众组织的负责人，时时、处处、事事都要成为活学活用毛主席著作的模范，在用字上狠下功夫。坚持天天学，每天至少学一小时，每周学两个半天，持之以恒，成为雷打不动的制度。充分发动群众，更扎实、更深入地把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向新阶段。
    二、筹备小组成员和革命群众组织的负责人，要突出无产阶级政治，坚持四个第一，大兴三八作风，狠抓活思想。要认真抓好两头，一头认真学习伟大领袖毛主席的最新最高指示，并及时研究贯彻执行的措施；一头要及时掌握群众的思想动态。要把两头很好地结合起来，深入细致地进行政治思想工作，及时分析研究内蒙古地区无产阶级文化大革命形势，坚决克服和防止只抓业务，不抓思想，埋头于事务，脱离政治的危险倾向。
    三、筹备小组成员和革命群众组织的负责人，要一刻也不脱离群众，要相信群众，依靠群众，尊重群众的首创精神。诚恳地向群众学习，甘当群众的小学生，遇事和群众商量，树立坚强的群众观点。不断深入群众，深入实际，要到矛盾最尖锐的地方去，到工作最困难的地方去，进行调查研究，帮助群众解决思想问题和实际问题。要虚心听取群众意见，接受群众的监督和批评。要拿出一定时间，有计划地亲自接待来访群众，亲自处理群众来信。革命群众组织参加筹备小组的成员，一律不脱离原单位。筹备小组成员要定期参加体力劳动，与群众打成一片，同甘共苦，保持劳动人民的本色，坚决反对任何形式的脱离群众的恶劣作风。
    四、筹备小组要加强集体领导，认真贯彻执行民主集中制。筹备小组内部，要充分发扬民主，不断进行小整风或谈心会，经常开展批评与自我批评；重大问题要经过集体研究决定，不得私自处理，反对个人说了算；未经集体讨论，筹备小组成员，不能随意代表筹备小组发表讲演；筹备小组成员，要明确分工，密切协作，勇于负责，挑重担子，大胆履行职责。
    五、筹备小组的办事机构，一定要“精兵简政”，减少层次，反对文牍主义，建立革命的工作制度和工作作风。筹备小组的成员要实行轮流值班制度，大部分成员要经常深入基层，接近群众。建立筹备小组办事机构负责同志联合办公的制度，实行面对面的领导。减少会议、汇报，反对开长会，不开无准备的会。发扬说干就干、雷厉风行的革命精神，反对疲疲沓沓、拖拖拉拉的不负责任的坏作风。要不断总结经验，打破老框框，创立新制度，新作风。
    六、发扬艰苦朴素的优良传统，勤俭办一切事业，反对铺张浪费，反对特殊化。要“既当‘官’，又当老百姓”，诚心诚意地做人民的勤务员。不讲排场，不闹阔气，不准请客送礼，不准迎来送往，不准占公家便宜，不准公车私用，严格遵守国家财政制度，不准乱批条子。我们要念念不忘毛主席的教导，坚决抵制资产阶级糖衣炮弹的袭击。
