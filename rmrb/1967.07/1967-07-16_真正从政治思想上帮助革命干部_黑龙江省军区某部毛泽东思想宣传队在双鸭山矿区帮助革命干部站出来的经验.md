The Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team from a certain unit of the Heilongjiang Military Region, upon entering the Daqingshan mining area, was met with great enthusiasm and a surge in revolutionary spirit among the broad revolutionary cadres. However, although many cadres had already been liberated with the help of the proletarian revolutionary masses, many of them, while physically standing up, had not yet done so ideologically. The masses' feedback on some cadres was: "They work hesitantly and are reluctant to take the lead in revolution." The team members, following Chairman Mao's instructions on correctly distinguishing between the two types of social contradictions, took the struggle between the two lines as their guiding principle. They linked the cadres' active thoughts with the great criticism, helping the cadres to thoroughly uproot the roots of the bourgeois reactionary line and deeply plant the roots of Mao Zedong Thought, making the broad revolutionary cadres stand firmly on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, truly standing up politically and ideologically. Now, the majority of revolutionary cadres in this mining area are full of vigor and fighting spirit, daring to take responsibility, working actively, and together with the proletarian revolutionary masses, they are building new achievements and setting new examples in the battle to seize revolution and promote production.

Taking the struggle between the two lines as the guiding principle, truly liberating cadres from the shackles of the bourgeois reactionary line

After cadres "came out," many still had various active thoughts. Some were resentful, believing they were wronged and blaming the masses for mistakenly attacking them; others feared speaking incorrectly and being criticized by the masses, worried about being held accountable in the future. Therefore, they did not work boldly, avoided what they should manage, and dared not fight against negative phenomena. Based on this situation, the team members and the proletarian revolutionary masses in the mining area organized the Red Rebel Corps, guiding cadres to lead in conducting great criticism, encouraging them to investigate the poisonous influences, dig out the roots of the poison, write big-character posters to expose, and hold meetings to criticize. They also started from class education, conducting four remembrances and four comparisons: remembering the bitterness of the old society and comparing it with the sweetness of the new society; remembering the fighting spirit at the beginning of the revolution and comparing it with current work performance; remembering the party's cultivation and comparing it with one's contributions to the revolution; remembering the situation when one was a worker and comparing it with the work performance after becoming a cadre. During the criticism meetings, cadres at all levels took the lead in participating in the criticism. They exposed the poisonous influences of the capitalist roaders within the party and the bourgeois reactionary line they promoted, seriously studying the great teachings of Chairman Mao, deeply examining their own positions in the struggle between the two lines. The former deputy director of a certain mine, Shen Shizhong, at a meeting called by the masses to denounce and criticize the capitalist roaders within the party, spoke twice, criticizing the revisionist goods propagated by the biggest capitalist roader within the party, such as material incentives and money as the guiding principle. In his criticism, he also linked and examined his own poisoning. Shen Shizhong, after the great criticism, drew a clear line and suddenly realized: in this struggle between the two lines, which concerns the direction of our country and mining area, he had been deceived by the biggest capitalist roader within the party, been poisoned by them, and if it were not for this Cultural Revolution to save him, he would have "peacefully evolved" away. His self-examination, the masses said, touched the soul, and thus trusted him even more.

In the great criticism, the cadres concentrated their hatred on the Chinese Khrushchev, directing their anger at the Chinese Khrushchev, holding him accountable, and digging out the roots from him, thereby deepening their hatred for the biggest capitalist roaders within the party; at the same time, they loved the great leader Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought even more.

Using the "Three Articles" as a weapon, breaking private interests and establishing public interests, liberating cadres from the quagmire of individualism

Chairman Mao taught us: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." Through great criticism and great struggle, revolutionary cadres' hatred for the biggest capitalist roaders within the party and the bourgeois reactionary line they promoted deepened, but they still did not clearly understand why they had consciously or unconsciously executed the bourgeois reactionary line in the past, and they still did not hate the "self" in their minds. Some thought that in the past, they spoke too much, managed too broadly, and suffered losses, so in the future, they should speak less, open their mouths slowly, and avoid problems. To make revolutionary cadres truly stand up ideologically, the team members and the Red Rebels together inspired the cadres to use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, take class struggle as the key, use the "Three Articles" as a weapon, consciously revolutionize, deeply touch the soul, break private interests and establish public interests. When exposing their thoughts, they tightly grasped the four moments when thoughts easily change: before and after liberation, before and after joining the party, before and after becoming a cadre, and before and after seizing power in the Cultural Revolution, shaking off the "self" and seeing the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought. With their exposed problems, they went to Chairman Mao's works to find answers, dug out the root causes of the problems, and raised them to the level of class struggle for recognition. To thoroughly solve the problems, they also conducted four thoughts and four observations: thinking about whether they high-held the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, observing their stance and viewpoint; thinking about their actions, observing the path they took; thinking about what they loved and who they used, observing the line they implemented; thinking about the policies they executed, observing the direction they insisted on. Thus, a struggle between public and private interests unfolded in their minds. Some comrades said: "This method really solves problems."

After studying Chairman Mao's teaching that "mistakes and setbacks have taught us, making us relatively wiser, and we can do things better," everyone understood why some things were not done better after "coming out," because they had not drawn true lessons, the "self" was at play, and they were still connected to the bourgeois reactionary line. Blaming the masses was because they had not been revolutionized; being deceived by the biggest capitalist roaders within the party was because they had partnered with the "self." Many cadres talked about their process of ideological transformation under the rule of selfishness: in the old society, they were treated like cattle and horses, suffering greatly; in New China, they vented their anger; after becoming cadres, they became arrogant; with some achievements, they became conceited; in the Cultural Revolution, they were struggled against and criticized, losing their spirit; this time, through studying Chairman Mao's works, fiercely fighting the "self," their revolutionary spirit was greatly boosted. Everyone realized: selfishness is the root of all evils, the source of all malice, and the corrosive agent of ideological revolutionization. They unanimously agreed that thousands of lessons, tens of thousands of lessons, the biggest lesson was not studying Chairman Mao's works actively and thoroughly and not transforming the worldview. In the future, they must firmly remember: Mao Zedong Thought cannot be separated from, class struggle cannot be forgotten, selfishness cannot be fought against, and ideological transformation cannot be relaxed. The more they fight ideologically, the brighter their thoughts become, the more comfortable their minds feel, the more revolutionary they become, and some even exposed problems that had never been revealed before. Many comrades, in terms of transforming their worldview, set "three highs" requirements for themselves: transforming thoughts with a high standard of "completely and thoroughly"; exposing thoughts with a high attitude of fearlessness and seeing the truth; correcting errors with a high speed of "seizing the day."

Using class struggle and production struggle practice as the classroom, helping cadres to thoroughly transform their attitude towards the masses

Chairman Mao taught us: "You must put politics in command, go among the masses, be with the masses, and make the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat even better." Through breaking private interests and establishing public interests, their understanding was raised, and the cadres decided to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, using class struggle and production struggle practice as the classroom, going to the masses' struggle to temper and improve themselves, building new achievements and setting new examples in the battle to seize revolution and promote production. They led by example, connected with the masses, set a good example, led in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, led in breaking private interests and establishing public interests, dared to say what should be said, dared to do what should be done, dared to manage what should be managed, and did not pass on, delegate, or avoid problems when encountering them. They not only dared to manage production but also dared to seize revolution. The head of the temporary management committee of a certain shaft, the former deputy secretary of the party branch, Zhan Yushan, after examining his errors at a cadre meeting, actively went to various sections to examine, and finally, three people were still not satisfied, so he examined himself to these three people. He said: "We made mistakes, so what's wrong with the masses criticizing us, what's not understandable?" Because the cadres' examination was quite deep, it educated the masses, and the masses' trust and support in turn inspired the cadres. Many cadres thought that in the past, they used a magnifying glass to look at the shortcomings of mass organizations and a microscope to look at their own advantages, and they did not think in line with the masses. Now, they think what the masses think, are anxious about what the masses are anxious about, hate what the masses hate, and love what the masses love, and their feelings towards the masses have changed.

The former party branch secretary, Wang Cai, once saw that some workers' discipline was not good, so he organized the workers to study the "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres in All Factories, Mines, and Enterprises Across the Country" and Chairman Mao's quotations, educating everyone to follow Chairman Mao's words and be models of revolution and production. The core members of the Red Rebel Corps actively supported his correct leadership, and everyone insisted on the eight-hour work system, using leisure time to make revolution. Wang Cai deeply felt: "In the past, I was deceived by the words of the biggest capitalist roaders within the party, and the workers did not listen to me; now, I listen to Chairman Mao's words, and the workers listen to me." Now, the cadres and masses in the Daqingshan mining area are working together to seize revolution and promote production, determined to turn the mining area into a bright red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    真正从政治思想上帮助革命干部
    黑龙江省军区某部毛泽东思想宣传队在双鸭山矿区帮助革命干部站出来的经验
    黑龙江省军区某部毛泽东思想宣传队进入双鸭山矿区后，广大革命干部欢欣鼓舞，革命精神大振。但是，已经在无产阶级革命派帮助下解放出来的干部，有不少人，人站出来了，思想上还未站起来。群众对一些干部的反映是：“工作躲躲闪闪，干革命不敢靠前。”宣传队的同志遵循毛主席关于正确区分两类社会矛盾的教导，以两条路线斗争为纲，联系干部的活思想，在大批判中帮助干部狠挖资产阶级反动路线的根子，深扎毛泽东思想的命根子，使广大革命干部站到毛主席革命路线一边，真正从政治思想上站起来。现在这个矿区绝大多数革命干部意气风发，斗志昂扬，勇于负责，积极工作，同无产阶级革命派一起，正在抓革命、促生产的战斗中建新功、立新劳。
    以两条路线斗争为纲，真正把干部从资产阶级反动路线的束缚下解放出来
    干部“亮相”后，不少同志还有各种活思想，有的“怨”气较大，认为自己没错，埋怨群众斗错了；有的怕讲错话，群众抓辫子，将来算总账。因此，工作不大胆，该管的不管，对不良现象不敢斗争。根据这种情况，宣传队同志和矿区无产阶级革命派组织红色造反团，引导干部带头搞好大批判，启发他们查流毒，挖毒根，写大字报揭，开大会批。还从阶级教育入手，进行四忆四比：忆旧社会的苦，比新社会的甜；忆参加革命初期的斗志，比现在的工作表现；忆党对自己的培养，比自己对革命的贡献；忆当工人时的情况，比当干部后的工作表现。召开批判大会时，各级干部带头参加批判。他们摆党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和他们所推行的资产阶级反动路线的流毒，认真学习伟大领袖毛主席的教导，深刻检查自己在两条路线斗争中究竟站在那一边。原某矿副矿长申世钟在群众召开的控诉、批判党内走资本主义道路当权派的大会上，接连两次发言，批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派宣扬的物质刺激、钞票挂帅等修正主义货色。他在批判中还联系检查了自己中的毒。申世钟经过大批判，划清了界限，恍然大悟：在这场关系到我们国家、我们矿区走什么道路的两条路线斗争中，自己上了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的当，中了他们的毒，假若没有这场文化大革命的挽救，自己就要“和平演变”过去了。他的检查，群众都说触及了灵魂，因而更加信任他了。
    在大批判中，干部们把仇恨集中到中国的赫鲁晓夫身上，怒火对准中国的赫鲁晓夫猛烧，账往他身上算，根往他身上挖，从而加深了对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的憎恨；同时更加热爱伟大的领袖毛主席和毛泽东思想。
    以“老三篇”为武器，破私立公，使干部从个人主义泥坑里解放出来
    毛主席教导我们说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。通过大批判、大斗争，革命干部对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其推行的资产阶级反动路线更加憎恨，但对自己过去为什么自觉、不自觉地执行了资产阶级反动路线，认识还不清楚，对头脑里的“私”字还恨不起来。有的认为过去说话多，管得宽，吃了亏，今后要少说话，慢张口，碰到问题绕道走。为了使革命干部真正从思想上站起来，宣传队的同志和红色造反者一起，启发干部以毛泽东思想为指针，以阶级斗争为纲，以“老三篇”为武器，自觉革命，狠触灵魂，破私立公。在亮思想时，紧紧抓住解放前后，入党前后，当干部前后，文化大革命夺权前后，这四个思想容易起变化的时机，把“私”字抖落出来，见一见毛泽东思想的阳光。带着自己亮出来的问题，到毛主席著作里找答案，挖出产生问题的根源，提到阶级斗争的纲上来认识。为了把问题挖到根上，他们还进行了四想四看：想自己是否高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，看立场观点；想自己所做所为，看自己走的是什么道路；想自己爱什么，重用什么人，看自己贯彻的什么路线；想自己执行的方针政策，看自己坚持的什么方向。从而，在脑子里展开了一场公与私的争夺战。有的同志说：“这种办法真解决问题”。
    大家在学习了毛主席关于“错误和挫折教训了我们，使我们比较地聪明起来了，我们的事情就办得好一些”的教导后，明白了“亮相”后为什么有些事情还没有办得好一些，就是因为没有吸取真正的教训，“私”字作怪，和资产阶级反动路线藕断丝连。埋怨群众，是因为自己没有革命化；上了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的当，是因为和“私”字搭了伙伴。许多干部谈了在“私”字统治下的思想转变过程是：旧社会当牛作马受尽了气，新中国成立出了气，当了干部染上了官气，有点成绩产生了骄气，文化大革命被斗受批泄了气，这次活学活用毛主席著作，狠斗“私”字，又大长了革命志气。大家认识到：私心是百病之根，万恶之源，是思想革命化的腐蚀剂。一致认为，千教训，万教训，没有活学活用好毛主席著作，没有改造好世界观是最大的教训。今后一定要牢牢记住：毛泽东思想离不得，阶级斗争忘不得，私心不斗了不得，思想改造松不得。越斗思想越亮堂，越斗心情越舒畅，越斗越革命化，有些人把从来没有暴露的问题也亮出来了。不少同志在改造世界观方面对自己提出了“三高”要求：改造思想，“完全、彻底”高标准；亮思想，不怕丑，刺刀见红高姿态；改正错误，“只争朝夕”高速度。
    以阶级斗争、生产斗争实践为课堂，帮助干部彻底转变对待群众的态度
    毛主席教导我们：“你们要政治挂帅，到群众里面去，和群众在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命搞得更好。”通过破私立公，提高了认识，干部们决心按照毛主席的教导，以阶级斗争、生产斗争实践为课堂，到群众斗争中去锻炼和提高，在抓革命、促生产战斗中建新功、立新劳。他们以身作则，联系群众，做好样子，带头活学活用毛主席著作，带头破私立公，该说的敢说，该做的敢做，该管的敢管，碰到问题不上交、不下放、不躲避，不仅敢管生产，而且敢抓革命。某井临时接管委员会负责人、原党总支副书记詹玉山对自己所犯的错误，在干部会上进行了检查后，又主动到各段去检查，最后还有三人不满意，就向这三人作检查。他说：“我们犯了错误，群众批评我们有什么不可以，有什么不通呢？”由于干部“亮相”检查比较深刻，教育了群众，群众的信任和支持又反过来使干部受到了鼓舞。不少干部认为，以前用放大镜看群众组织的缺点，用显微镜看自己的优点，和群众想不到一块去。现在想群众所想，急群众所急，恨群众所恨，爱群众所爱，对群众的感情起了变化。
    原党支部书记王才，有一次见到有些工人劳动纪律不大好，便组织工人学习《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工和革命干部的信》和毛主席语录，教育大家要听毛主席的话，做革命和生产的模范。红色造反团的核心成员带头支持他的正确领导，大家坚持八小时工作制，业余时间闹革命。王才深有感受地说：“过去我受骗听了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的话，工人不听我的话；现在我听毛主席的话，工人听我的话。”现在双鸭山矿区的干部、群众齐心合力抓革命、促生产，决心把矿区办成一个红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。　（据新华社哈尔滨十四日电）
