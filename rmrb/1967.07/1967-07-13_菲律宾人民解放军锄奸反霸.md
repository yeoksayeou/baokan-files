The Philippine People's Liberation Army is resolutely carrying out the Philippine Communist Party's policy of developing rural base areas and armed struggle. Recently, they have frequently taken the initiative to launch attacks, supporting peasants in their efforts to eliminate traitors and bullies.

According to reports, in early June, the Philippine People's Liberation Army launched three attacks in the central part of Luzon, eliminating a total of six landlord bullies and traitors.

According to Manila newspapers, on the evening of June 6, three soldiers of the Liberation Army rushed into the courtyard of a landlord bully in a village in the province of Pangasinan and shot him dead. In another area, two Liberation Army soldiers bravely and cleverly ambushed five spies from the First Security District of the Philippine government, killing four and seriously injuring one before safely retreating.

A notorious bureaucrat in the San Luis district of Pangasinan province was also executed by the Liberation Army.

According to the Philippine "Daily Mirror," in the first four months of this year, the Philippine People's Liberation Army, in supporting the peasants' struggle to eliminate traitors and bullies, executed a total of eighteen landlord bullies. Last year, the Philippine People's Liberation Army eliminated seventy-three traitors and bullies for the peasants, winning the support and approval of the broad masses of impoverished peasants.
