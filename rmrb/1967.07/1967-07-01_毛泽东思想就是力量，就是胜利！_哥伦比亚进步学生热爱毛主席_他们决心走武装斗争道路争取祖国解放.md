Mao Zedong Thought is Power, is Victory!
Colombian Progressive Students Love Chairman Mao
They Resolve to Take the Road of Armed Struggle to Strive for National Liberation

According to a Xinhua News Agency report, Bogota: Colombian progressive university students, in their recent struggle against the brutal suppression of students by the military police, have drawn courage and strength from the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and have come to realize that only by taking the road of armed struggle as pointed out by the great teacher Mao Zedong can they achieve revolutionary victory.

Since Colombian students in the capital Bogota and other cities recently launched anti-government struggles against fare increases, the Colombian authorities have sent out large numbers of military police to carry out horrifying persecution of the students. Many students and teachers have been arrested, beaten, and subjected to personal humiliation. The army has also deployed tanks to occupy the National University of Colombia, and more than 300 university students have been detained in a military camp in Bogota.

However, as Chairman Mao said, "All the reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. All the reactionaries are merely paper tigers. In essence, they are reactionaries, but the people have strength." In the course of their arduous struggle, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has given the Colombian students courage and strength, and shown them the way forward.

Many students at the National University of Colombia have Chairman Mao's works and the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." There are also portraits of Chairman Mao hanging in their dormitories. Several students said: "We have already engraved Mao Zedong Thought in our hearts forever."

One student said: "The police destroyed our precious portrait of Chairman Mao, but we know that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will print more portraits of Chairman Mao in China, and revolutionaries in many of our countries will also print portraits of our beloved Chairman Mao."

This student also pointed out that imperialism, the bourgeoisie, and revisionism can absolutely not defame the brilliant thoughts of the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time, Mao Zedong.

Another student said: "In my dormitory, in addition to having the works of Chairman Mao and the 'Quotations from Chairman Mao,' there is also a portrait of Chairman Mao on my desk. I have never understood the necessity of constantly studying the works of Chairman Mao for the liberation of my country as I do today."

He also said that after the imperialists and domestic reactionaries launched this mad attack on the students, more and more people will take the road of armed struggle as pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong. He is also ready to immediately go to the mountains to join the guerrilla struggle.

He said: "We Colombian students will fight until we finally overthrow American imperialism, the Colombian bourgeoisie, and modern revisionism."

　　毛泽东思想就是力量，就是胜利！
　　哥伦比亚进步学生热爱毛主席
　　他们决心走武装斗争道路争取祖国解放
    据新华社讯　波哥大消息：哥伦比亚进步的大学生在最近反对军警残酷镇压学生的反暴斗争中，战无不胜的毛泽东思想给他们带来了勇气和力量，并使他们认识到，只有走上伟大导师毛泽东同志所指出的武装斗争道路，才能取得革命的胜利。
    自从哥伦比亚首都波哥大和其他城市的学生最近为反对车费涨价而展开反政府斗争以来，哥伦比亚当局派出大批军警，对学生进行了骇人听闻的迫害，许多学生和教师遭到逮捕、毒打和人身侮辱，军队还出动坦克占领了哥伦比亚国立大学，三百多名大学生被关在波哥大的军营里。
    但是，正如毛主席所说的，各国反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”在哥伦比亚学生进行艰苦斗争的时候，战无不胜的毛泽东思想给他们增添了勇气和力量，指明了前进的道路。
    哥伦比亚国立大学的不少学生有伟大领袖毛主席的著作和《毛主席语录》，他们的宿舍里还挂着毛主席像。几个学生说：我们已经把毛泽东思想永远铭记在心里了。
    一个学生说：“警察把我们珍贵的毛主席像毁坏了，但是我们知道，文化大革命将使中国印刷出更多的毛主席像，我们许多国家的革命者也将印刷亲爱的毛主席像。”
    这个学生还指出，帝国主义、资产阶级和修正主义者绝对诋毁不了当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东的光辉思想。
    另一个学生说：“在我的宿舍里，除了有毛主席著作和《毛主席语录》以外，在写字台上还有一张毛主席像。我从来没有象今天这样懂得经常学习毛主席著作对于我的祖国的解放的必要性。”
    他还说，在帝国主义和国内反动派对学生发动这次疯狂进攻之后，越来越多的人将走上毛泽东同志指出的武装斗争的道路，他也准备立即到山区参加游击斗争。
    他说：“我们哥伦比亚学生将进行斗争，直到最后打倒美帝国主义、哥伦比亚资产阶级和现代修正主义。”
