The editorial note: The article "Do Not Let Comrades Fall Behind" raises an important issue: after seizing power, the proletarian revolutionary faction must accept supervision from the masses. Supervision from the masses from the bottom up, and mutual supervision within the leadership core of revolutionary organizations, must all be greatly advocated, greatly promoted, and greatly strengthened.

Currently, the proletarian revolutionary faction that has seized power faces the question of where to go next: to persist on the road of revolutionization or unknowingly take the path of peaceful evolution? Strengthening mass supervision is precisely to prevent minor issues from growing into major problems, to timely resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, and to forever maintain the proletarian character.

The shortcomings and errors of a member of the Shanghai No. 19 Dyeing and Finishing Factory Revolutionary Committee seem minor, but "peaceful evolution" starts from "small" things. To prevent minor issues from growing into major problems, we must start from "small" things. Otherwise, small errors can develop into big errors, and minor issues in daily life can develop into political issues.

After discovering these minor shortcomings and errors in their comrades, the comrades of the No. 19 Dyeing and Finishing Factory Revolutionary Committee took a completely revolutionary attitude. They did not indulge or tolerate but instead gave serious criticism, making their comrades aware in time. This is a true concern for revolutionary comrades and a true responsibility to the Party's cause.

The proletarian revolutionary faction should learn from this spirit of "preventing minor issues from growing into major problems" and learn from this correct attitude towards the shortcomings and errors of revolutionary comrades. This will enable us to always stand firm in the struggle against bourgeois ideology.

A "small incident" caught the attention of the comrades of the Shanghai No. 19 Dyeing and Finishing Factory Revolutionary Committee: a committee member was sent to the bureau to attend a meeting criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line. The meeting lasted three days. On one of the days, which was a Sunday, this comrade did not attend the meeting but instead took care of his personal affairs. The incident was minor, but it involved the relationship between "public" and "private" and could not be ignored.

From this small incident, everyone thought of some changes in this comrade after seizing power: he had become accustomed to sitting in the office and no longer went to the workshop to labor. A person who had made a relatively serious mistake approached him with selfish intentions, flattered him, and he was not alerted and did not see any problem.

Seeing that a comrade was about to fall behind, what should they do? Everyone studied "Against Liberalism" with this question in mind. Chairman Mao's teachings were like a lighthouse guiding their way forward. Everyone decided to follow Chairman Mao's words, actively carry out ideological struggle, and help the comrade maintain the proletarian character.

In a simple office, in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, the factory revolutionary committee held a meeting. Everyone opened the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and read aloud: "Because of victory, arrogance, the tendency to consider oneself a hero, the tendency to stop progressing, the tendency to seek enjoyment and not want to live a hard life, may grow. Because of victory, the people thank us, and the bourgeoisie will also come to flatter us. The enemy's military force cannot conquer us, this has been proven. The bourgeoisie's flattery may conquer the weak-willed in our ranks." At this moment, Chairman Mao's teachings felt particularly close to them.

The comrades were full of enthusiasm and spoke earnestly to this comrade, criticizing and helping him. Some reminded him not to overlook minor issues in life. Haven't some people who took the capitalist road started from minor issues in life? Some reminded him not to forget labor. Seizing power and then sitting in the office all the time, alienating oneself from the masses and from labor, this is not like the proletariat! Some directly questioned: For what did we revolt? Was it just for personal gain, just to wear a "mandarin hat"?

This comrade was arrogant and initially could not accept these sharp criticisms, feeling resistant. Old worker Qian Zuoxing saw that his comrade could not withstand the new test after the change in status and could not humbly accept the opinions of comrades, and he was so angry that tears streamed down his face. He said excitedly: "Think about it, why didn't that person who made mistakes ignore you when you were oppressed? After seizing power, they flatter you? A cigarette, a cup of alcohol, these are not small matters, this is class struggle, this is the bourgeoisie's corruption of us! Don't think that we proletarians have seized power and everything is fine, the world is peaceful, class struggle is still continuing!"

The comrades' enthusiastic feelings and earnest criticisms deeply touched this comrade's thoughts, hitting his sore spot. He was moved to tears and said to the comrades: "What the comrades said are all words of gold, I will always keep them in mind, I will study Chairman Mao's works well, eliminate selfish thoughts, and always be alert to the bourgeoisie's corruption!"

A former factory director who had just joined the revolutionary committee had been closely watching the progress of the meeting. This sharp, principled, and yet class-friendly ideological struggle deeply attracted him. Until the end, he finally let out a sigh of relief and said: "This is truly the temperament of the revolutionary rebels!"

### 不能让战友掉队

专栏：

    编者按：《不能让战友掉队》这篇通讯，向我们提出了一个重要的问题，就是无产阶级革命派在掌权以后，必须接受群众的革命监督。自下而上的群众监督，革命组织领导核心内部的互相监督，都需要大大提倡、大大发扬、大大加强。
    当前，掌权的无产阶级革命派，面临着向何处去的问题，是坚持走革命化的道路，还是不知不觉地走上和平演变的道路？加强群众性的革命监督，正是为了防微杜渐，及时抵制资产阶级思想的侵袭，永远保持无产阶级的本色。
    上海十九漂染厂革命委员会那个委员的缺点和错误，看起来似乎不大，但是，“和平演变”正是从“小”的地方“变”起，要防微杜渐，就是要从“小”的地方“防”起。不然的话，小错误可以发展为大错误，生活小节问题也可以发展为政治问题。
    十九漂染厂革命委员会的同志，发现了自己战友身上这些小的缺点错误以后，采取了完全革命的态度，不是姑息迁就，而是严肃批评，使自己的战友及时警觉起来，这是对革命同志的真正爱护，对党的事业的真正负责。
    无产阶级革命派，应该学习这种“防微杜渐”的革命精神，应该学习这种对待革命战友的缺点错误的正确态度，使我们在同资产阶级思想作斗争中，永远立于不败之地。
　　不能让战友掉队
    一件“小事”，引起了上海十九漂染厂革命委员会同志们的注意：厂革委会派一个委员到局里去开会，批判资产阶级反动路线。会开了三天。中间有一天是星期天，这位同志没有参加会，干自己的私事去了。事情不大，但是涉及“公”和“私”的关系，不能忽视。
    从这件小事，大家又联想到了这位委员在掌权以后身上的一些变化：他习惯于坐办公室了，不大到车间劳动了。一个犯了比较严重错误的人怀着利己的目的，接近他、奉承他，他也毫不警觉，不觉得有什么问题了。
    眼看着战友要掉队，怎么办？大家带着问题学习《反对自由主义》。毛主席的教导象灯塔一样给他们照亮了前进的方向。大家决心听毛主席的话，积极开展思想斗争，帮助战友保持无产阶级本色。
    在一间简陋的办公室里，在毛主席像前，厂革命委员会开会了。大家打开红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，齐声朗读：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。因为胜利，人民感谢我们，资产阶级也会出来捧场。敌人的武力是不能征服我们的，这点已经得到证明了。资产阶级的捧场则可能征服我们队伍中的意志薄弱者。”此时此地，毛主席的教导使他们感到格外亲切。
    战友们满腔热情，苦口婆心地对这位同志进行批评和帮助。有的告诫他，不要忽视生活小事，有一些走资本主义道路的当权派不就是从生活问题上开始滑下去的吗？有人提醒他不要忘了劳动，一掌权就老坐办公室，脱离群众，脱离劳动，这哪象工人阶级？有人直率地质问：革命造反为了啥？难道就是为了个人翻身，为了戴“乌纱帽”？
    这位同志居功自傲，一开始接受不了这些尖锐的批评，思想上有抵触。老工人钱祖兴看到自己的战友经不起地位变化以后新的考验，又不能虚心听取同志们的意见，激愤得热泪直流。他激动地说：“你想想，为什么你受压制的时候，那个犯错误的人不理睬你？当权以后人家就那么奉承你？一支烟，一杯酒，决不是小事，这就是阶级斗争，就是资产阶级思想对我们的腐蚀啊！别以为我们无产阶级掌了权就万事大吉，天下太平，阶级斗争还在继续啊！”
    同志们激动的心情和语重心长的批评，深深地打动了这位同志的思想，触到了这位同志的痛处，他感动得含着泪花对同志们说：“同志们讲的都是金玉良言，我要永远记在心头，我要好好学习毛主席著作，破除私心杂念，时刻警惕资产阶级思想的腐蚀！”
    一位新参加革命委员会的原来的厂长一直在紧张地注视着会议的进展，这种尖锐的、原则性的、而又充满了阶级友爱精神的思想斗争，深深地吸引了他。直到最后，他才舒了一口气说：“这真是革命造反派的脾气！”
