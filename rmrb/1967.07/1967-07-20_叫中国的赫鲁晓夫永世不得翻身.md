High Hold the Great Red Banner of Mao Zedong Thought and Launch a New High Tide of Revolutionary Criticism
The leadership organs of the PLA and the troops stationed in Beijing, with deep class hatred, are participating in the revolutionary criticism movement.
Call for the Chinese Khrushchev to Never Reverse His Fate
Broad masses of soldiers and officers say: We are the critics of the old world, the creators and defenders of the new world. We must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating fallen dogs, and criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party and the army who are taking the capitalist road deeply, thoroughly, and expose them completely, making them stink for ten thousand years and never reverse their fate.

New China News Agency, July 19th: "If we want the revolution to go to the end, we must use revolutionary methods to resolutely, thoroughly, cleanly, and completely eliminate all reactionary forces." The leadership organs of the People's Liberation Army and the troops stationed in Beijing, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, with deep hatred towards the Chinese Khrushchev, are launching a people's war to annihilate the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, pursuing and beating these fallen dogs. The soldiers and officers regard this unprecedented large-scale revolutionary criticism as a great historical task before them, a great struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines, and a key to consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing capitalist restoration. They say with revolutionary enthusiasm: We are the critics of the old world, the creators and defenders of the new world. We must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating fallen dogs, and criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road deeply, thoroughly, and expose them completely, making them stink for ten thousand years and never reverse their fate.

The revolutionary masses of the various general departments and military branches of the People's Liberation Army have maintained high vigilance against the class enemy in the past year of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, always regarding the complete annihilation of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists within the army as the most important great historical task. In the recent high tide of great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle, the soldiers and officers have a deeper understanding of the great significance of revolutionary criticism. They say, as Chairman Mao pointed out long ago: The representatives of various exploiting classes are always studying strategies to deal with us, "observing the direction" to seek an opportunity to "counterattack." Numerous facts prove that whether they are dogs on the shore or fallen dogs, as long as they are dogs, they will not change their nature of biting people, and they must be beaten and beaten to death. The representatives of the revolutionary masses of the General Logistics Department and its subordinate units in Beijing emphasized at today's denunciation meeting of the Chinese Khrushchev: Only by thoroughly carrying out revolutionary criticism and thoroughly eliminating the poison of revisionism can we thoroughly smash the dreams of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, big and small, to return to power. If we do not remain vigilant and do not carry out criticism, they may be able to carry out a restoration and form a counter-revolutionary alliance, drowning the working people in a sea of blood. We revolutionary masses must always remember class struggle and always remember the dictatorship of the proletariat, launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, beat fallen dogs, and "carry the revolution through to the end."

The revolutionary masses of the leadership organs of the Air Force and Navy recently pointed out at a meeting reviewing the struggle course of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the past year and deciding to launch a new high tide of criticism: This unprecedented large-scale revolutionary criticism is also a general offensive against the old world, a great sweep of the decadent ideology of the exploiting class, a battle of annihilation to clean up the garbage heap of various kinds of revisionism, a great struggle to establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and a great furnace to cultivate and train millions of reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. The revolutionary masses of the leadership organ of the Air Force have recently repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's brilliant expositions on class and class struggle, determined to use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as the sharpest weapon, consolidate and develop the great alliance of revolution, organize a vast army of cultural revolution, seize the enemy's vital points, engage in "close combat," combine the revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, and in the criticism, establish Mao Zedong Thought, and temper themselves into reliable successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is the sharpest weapon of revolutionary criticism. The broad masses of soldiers and officers stationed in Beijing, with Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, fiercely fight and criticize the Chinese Khrushchev. They use Chairman Mao's principle of "fighting to the end and not giving an inch" to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's nationalism and class capitulationism; with Chairman Mao's expositions on the proletarian revolution and the dictatorship of the proletariat, they criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's theory of the extinction of class struggle; with Chairman Mao's thought of continuous revolution, they criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacy of "consolidating the new democratic order"; with Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts on the socialist revolution and socialist construction, they criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's fallacies of the "four freedoms" and the "three selfs and one package"; with Chairman Mao's expositions on the proletarian life and death view and revolutionary heroism, they criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's philosophy of survival and traitor philosophy; with Chairman Mao's policy of uniting the majority, they criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's bourgeois reactionary line of "striking a large area and protecting a small number" in the cadre issue, etc. The broad masses of soldiers and officers in the Beijing troops, in order to criticize and expose the ugly face of the Chinese Khrushchev deeply, have carried out extensive activities of exposing the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and peeling off his disguise. They expose the revisionist policies taken by the Chinese Khrushchev at critical moments in various historical periods, peeling off his disguise of being "consistently correct"; they expose his landlord-bourgeois class stance and personal ambition, peeling off his disguise of being an "old revolutionary"; they expose his actions in line with Khrushchev, peeling off his disguise of being an "anti-revisionist fighter"; they expose his fraudulent "Self-Cultivation," peeling off his disguise of being an "authority on party building"; they expose his decadent moral character, peeling off his disguise of being a "model of self-cultivation"; they expose his crimes of raising the red flag to oppose the red flag, peeling off his disguise of being an "old Marxist." The more they peel, the deeper their hatred for the Chinese Khrushchev, and the greater their determination to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road deeply, thoroughly, and expose them completely. The broad masses of soldiers and officers say: The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have countless crimes and evils, but the most fundamental evil is to oppose Chairman Mao, oppose Mao Zedong Thought, and oppose Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and to change the color of the socialist state won by the revolutionary forerunners with their blood and heads, and carry out capitalist restoration. We must firmly grasp the gun and the pen, with the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating fallen dogs, criticize them and expose them completely, and make them never reverse their fate.

The new high tide of criticism that is vigorously unfolding in the various general departments, military branches, and the three services stationed in Beijing of the People's Liberation Army is unprecedented in scale and momentum. The revolutionary masses of the three services have achieved a great alliance of revolution, united in hatred of the enemy, and their strength is unprecedentedly strong. At the oath-taking rallies with thunderous battle cries and at large, medium, and small struggle-criticism meetings, they are filled with indignation, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, and with a large amount of ironclad facts, expose and criticize the crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the handful of power-holders within their own units who are taking the capitalist road, refuting them to the point of having no integrity left. In the revolutionary criticism, the revolutionary masses become stronger and stronger in the fight, and the masses who were originally in an intermediate state are quickly awakening and taking action, closely uniting around the revolutionary masses, and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, big and small, are increasingly falling into the vast sea of people's war.

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗　掀起革命大批判新高潮
    解放军领导机关和驻京三军指战员满怀刻骨阶级仇恨投入革命大批判运动
    叫中国的赫鲁晓夫永世不得翻身
    广大指战员满怀革命豪情地说：我们是旧世界的批判者，新世界的创造者、保卫者，我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬痛打“落水狗”的彻底革命精神，从政治上、思想上、理论上把党内和军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批深批透、批倒批臭。
    新华社十九日讯　“如果要使革命进行到底，那就是用革命的方法，坚决彻底干净全部地消灭一切反动势力”。人民解放军领导机关和驻京部队广大干部战士，遵循我们伟大领袖毛主席的这一教导，怀着对中国的赫鲁晓夫的刻骨仇恨，正在开展一场围歼党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的人民战争，穷追猛打这伙“落水狗”。指战员们把这场规模空前的革命大批判，看作是摆在他们面前的伟大历史任务，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的大决战，是巩固无产阶级专政、防止资本主义复辟的关键。他们满怀革命豪情地说：我们是旧世界的批判者，新世界的创造者、保卫者，我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬痛打“落水狗”的彻底革命精神，从政治上、思想上、理论上把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批深批透、批倒批臭，叫它们遗臭万年，永世不得翻身。
    人民解放军各总部、各军兵种领导机关无产阶级革命派，在一年来的无产阶级文化大革命中，对阶级敌人始终保持高度的警惕，始终把全歼党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和军内一小撮反革命修正主义分子，当作是头等重要的伟大历史任务。在最近掀起的大揭发、大批判、大斗争的新高潮中，指战员们对革命大批判的伟大意义认识得更加深刻了。他们说，正象毛主席早就指出的那样：各种剥削阶级的代表人物“老是在研究对付我们的策略，‘窥测方向’，以求一逞。有时他们会‘装死躺下’，等待时机，‘反攻过去’。”无数事实证明，无论岸上的狗，落水的狗，凡是狗，是不会改变咬人的本性的，非得痛打、打死不可。总后勤部和所属驻京单位无产阶级革命派的代表们，今天在声讨中国的赫鲁晓夫的会上，以他们同总后勤部党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派反复较量的经验，强调指出：只有彻底地进行革命的大批判，彻底清除修正主义的流毒，才能彻底粉碎党内大大小小的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派妄图卷土重来的迷梦；假如我们不加警惕，不搞大批判，他们就有可能实行复辟，搞一个反革命联合，把劳动人民淹没在血泊中。我们无产阶级革命派必须念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，掀起革命的大批判的新高潮，痛打“落水狗”，“将革命进行到底”。
    空军、海军领导机关的无产阶级革命派，最近在回顾一年来无产阶级文化大革命的斗争历程，决心掀起新的大批判高潮的战斗会议上还指出，这场空前规模的革命大批判，也是向旧世界发动的一次总攻击，是对剥削阶级腐朽意识形态的一次大扫荡，是清除形形色色的修正主义垃圾堆的一场歼灭战，是大立毛泽东思想绝对权威的大战斗，是培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业可靠接班人的大熔炉。空军领导机关无产阶级革命派最近反复学习了毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的光辉论述，决心以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为最锐利的武器，巩固和发展革命的大联合，组织起浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，抓住敌人要害，进行“白刃战”，把革命的大批判同本单位的斗批改结合起来，在大批判中大立毛泽东思想，把自己锻炼成为无产阶级革命事业可靠的接班人。
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是革命的大批判的最锐利的武器。驻京部队广大指战员以毛泽东思想为武器，对准中国的赫鲁晓夫，狠斗猛批。他们以毛主席“针锋相对，寸土必争”的方针，批判中国的赫鲁晓夫的民族投降主义和阶级投降主义；以毛主席关于无产阶级革命和无产阶级专政的论述，批判中国的赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭论”；以毛主席不断革命的思想，批判中国的赫鲁晓夫的“巩固新民主主义秩序”的谬论；以毛主席关于社会主义革命和社会主义建设的光辉思想，批判中国的赫鲁晓夫的“四大自由”、“三自一包”的谬论；以毛主席关于无产阶级生死观和革命英雄主义的论述，批判中国的赫鲁晓夫的活命哲学、叛徒哲学；以毛主席关于团结大多数的方针，批判中国的赫鲁晓夫在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，等等。北京部队广大指战员，为了把中国的赫鲁晓夫的丑恶嘴脸批深揭透，广泛开展了大摆中国的赫鲁晓夫的罪状，大剥中国的赫鲁晓夫的画皮的活动。他们摆在各个历史时期的关键时刻中国的赫鲁晓夫所采取的修正主义方针，剥他“一贯正确”的画皮；摆他的地主资产阶级立场和个人野心，剥他“老革命”的画皮；摆他和赫鲁晓夫一脉相传的言行，剥他“反修闯将”的画皮；摆他欺人之谈的《修养》，剥他“建党权威”的画皮；摆他腐朽的道德品质，剥他“修养模范”的画皮；摆他打着“红旗”反红旗的罪行，剥他“老马克思主义”的画皮。越剥，大家对中国的赫鲁晓夫的仇恨越深，誓把中国的赫鲁晓夫和党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批深批透批臭的决心越大。广大指战员说：党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，千条罪，万种恶，最根本的罪恶，就是反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的革命路线，就是要把革命前辈用鲜血和头颅换来的社会主义国家改变颜色，实行资本主义复辟。我们一定要紧握枪杆子，拿起笔杆子，以痛打“落水狗”的彻底革命精神，把他们批倒批臭，让他们永世不得翻身。
    正在人民解放军各总部、军兵种领导机关和驻京三军各部队蓬勃展开的这场大批判的新高潮，规模之大，来势之猛，前所未有。三军无产阶级革命派实现革命的大联合，同仇敌忾，力量空前强大。在杀声震天的誓师大会上，在大中小型的斗批会上，他们满腔怒火，在毛泽东思想的指引下，以大量铁的事实，揭发批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和本单位党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪行，把他们驳得体无完肤。在革命的大批判中，无产阶级革命派越战越强，原来处于中间状态的群众，正在迅速觉悟过来，行动起来，紧紧团结在无产阶级革命派周围，党内大大小小的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，越来越陷入人民战争的汪洋大海。
