A Xinhua News Agency Shanghai July 14 dispatch reports: Revolutionary teachers at Fudan University are actively participating in the "resume classes, make revolution" campaign. They are going to the students, learning Mao Zedong's works with the revolutionary youngsters, conducting revolutionary criticism, and carrying out educational revolution, learning from workers, peasants, and soldiers. They are determined to smash the old educational system thoroughly with the revolutionary students and strive to be pioneers of the educational revolution.

In the struggle against a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and in the process of criticizing the bourgeois reactionary line, the revolutionary teachers of this school began to fight side by side with the revolutionary youngsters. Since April, during the high tide of criticism and in the three summer labor and military-political training, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat have further united the teachers who were deeply deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line and the revisionist educational line. All these have laid the foundation for the revolutionary teachers to quickly join the battle of "resume classes, make revolution."

There are thousands of courses, but the most important course is to study the works of Chairman Mao. Revolutionary teachers follow Chairman Mao's instruction, "To be the people's teacher, one must first be the people's student," and study Mao Zedong's works with the students, exchanging learning experiences with each other. Revolutionary teachers of the Philosophy Department and the students are preparing to hold a meeting to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Practice." Many revolutionary teachers have expressed their determination to learn from the revolutionary youngsters' boundless love and loyalty to Mao Zedong Thought, and to further reform their world outlook with Mao Zedong Thought.

Revolutionary teachers go to the students and conduct revolutionary criticism with them. Revolutionary teachers of the Journalism Department and the students study, discuss, and write articles together, launching a criticism of revisionist journalism. Revolutionary teachers of the International Politics Department and the students join forces to criticize the capitulationist line of the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road in international class struggle, and in conjunction with the current international class struggle situation, they organized a criticism of relevant poisonous films. Revolutionary teachers of the Physics Department launched a criticism of the revisionist line in scientific research work. They said: In the "resume classes, make revolution" campaign in the natural sciences, criticism must be the main focus.

Revolutionary teachers also conduct investigations and research with the students to make thorough and detailed preparations for the educational revolution. Revolutionary teachers of the Chemistry Department and the students conducted a systematic investigation and research on the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating the department. Revolutionary teachers of the Physics Department and the students went to factories to investigate the harm caused by the revisionist educational line that was detached from the masses, detached from reality, and detached from class struggle, and they are determined to explore a proletarian path for running the department in practice.

Following Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," revolutionary teachers actively participate in military training, learning from workers, and learning from peasants. They work in the communes near the school and in factories. Every morning, teachers and students practice together on the playground, doing drills, running, throwing hand grenades, etc. Revolutionary teachers and students follow Chairman Mao's instructions and implement the principle of "officers teaching soldiers, soldiers teaching officers, and soldiers teaching soldiers" in the "resume classes, make revolution" campaign. They teach and learn from each other, and a completely new proletarian teacher-student relationship is gradually forming.

Revolutionary teachers of Fudan University have expressed their determination to be brave pioneers of the educational revolution in the "resume classes, make revolution" campaign. They said: In the past, students revolved around teachers, but now we teachers must revolve around students, contributing our efforts to cultivating millions of successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.

    新华社上海十四日电　复旦大学革命教师积极参加复课闹革命，纷纷到学生中去，和革命小将们一起学习毛主席著作，一起开展革命的大批判，进行教育革命，学工、学农、学军。他们决心和革命学生一起，彻底砸烂旧教育制度，争当教育革命的探索者。
    在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，在批判资产阶级反动路线的过程中，这个学校的革命教师就开始和革命小将并肩战斗。今年四月份以来，在大批判的高潮中，在三夏劳动和军政训练中，无产阶级革命派又进一步团结了受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽，受修正主义教育路线毒害较深的教师。这些都为革命教师迅速投入复课闹革命的战斗，打下了基础。
    千种课，万种课，学习毛主席著作是最重要的课。广大革命教师遵循毛主席“要做人民的先生，先做人民的学生”的教导，和学生一起学习毛主席著作，相互交流学习体会。哲学系的革命教师和学生们一起，为纪念毛主席的光辉著作《实践论》发表三十周年，正在筹备召开讲用会。不少革命教师表示，一定要学习革命小将们对毛泽东思想的无限热爱和无限忠诚，进一步用毛泽东思想改造自己的世界观。
    革命教师们到学生中去，和学生一起进行革命的大批判。新闻系革命教师和学生一起学习、讨论、写文章，展开了对修正主义新闻学的批判。国际政治系革命教师和学生们结合在一起，批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在国际阶级斗争中的投降主义路线，并结合当前的国际阶级斗争形势，组织了对有关的毒草影片的批判。物理二系的革命教师展开了对科研工作中修正主义路线的批判。他们说：理科复课闹革命，也要以大批判为主。
    革命教师还和学生一起进行调查研究，为彻底进行教育革命做踏实细致的准备工作。化学系的革命教师和学生一起，对资产阶级知识分子统治本系的现象，进行了系统的调查研究。物理二系的革命教师和学生一起下工厂，调查过去脱离群众、脱离实际、脱离阶级斗争的修正主义教育路线所造成的危害，决心在实践中摸索出一条无产阶级的办系路线。
    革命教师遵照毛主席的“五·七”指示，积极参加军训、学工、学农等活动。他们在学校附近的公社里、工厂中参加劳动。每天清晨，教师和同学一起在操场上进行队列操练、跑步、掷手榴弹，等等。革命教师和学生按照毛主席的教导，在复课闹革命中贯彻了“官教兵，兵教官，兵教兵”的原则，互教互学，教学相长，一种全新的、无产阶级的师生关系正在逐步形成。
    复旦大学的革命教师们表示，一定要在复课闹革命中做教育革命的勇敢探索者。他们说：过去是学生围着教师转，现在我们教师要围着学生转，为培养千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人贡献自己的力量。
