Since the new leaders of the Soviet revisionists took office, they have been vigorously promoting free markets. In Moscow, they have built tall buildings for the free markets, which look impressive from the outside. The markets offer many food items and daily necessities that are never seen in state-run stores, and the prices are exorbitant, with sellers setting prices at will.

In Kiev, the capital of the Ukrainian Republic, the free market is bustling with people. There are shouts to attract customers, cries of vendors, and arguments. The stalls vary in size. According to an old woman selling goods, "The stalls are grabbed by whoever is stronger. Those with more strength can grab the better spots, and fights often break out over the best locations." To secure a good spot, many people come at night.

The prices in the free market are often double those in state-run stores. Pork, which is rarely seen in state-run stores, is plentiful and of high quality here, even better than what is depicted on the signs in state-run stores.

In contrast to the development of this capitalist commodity economy in the free markets, the socialist facade of state-run stores is becoming increasingly tattered.

Recently, the deputy minister of the Commerce Department of the Estonian Republic admitted in an article published in the *Communist of Estonia* magazine that only cities directly under the republic can supply a bit of fresh and pickled cabbage, while other places cannot buy any. The construction plans for stores, canteens, and warehouses have not been completed year after year.

The article states that the supply of cabbage, cucumbers, early vegetables, fruits, and food is far from meeting the needs of customers. The cooperative societies have failed to complete their pickled cabbage plans for several years in a row. Some representatives of the cooperative societies even travel from the districts to the capital, Tallinn, to purchase pickled cabbage to sell before the holidays.

    自由市场上大做赚钱生意
    国营商店计划连年完不成
    苏修新领导上台以来，对发展自由市场大卖力气。在莫斯科，为自由市场盖了高大的房子，外貌很可观。市场上很多食品、日用品等都是国营商店中从来没有的，价格昂贵，卖主可以任意要价。
    在乌克兰共和国首府基辅的自由市场上，摩肩接踵，熙熙攘攘，这里有招徕顾客的?喝声，有叫卖声，有吵骂声。卖货人占的位置大小不一样。据一位卖东西的老大娘说：“位置都是抢的，谁的力气大，谁就可以抢到好位置，为抢地盘经常打架。”为了抢占好的位置，许多人夜间就来了。
    自由市场上的价格，往往比国营商店高一倍。在国营商店里少有的猪肉，这里又肥又美，比国营商店里招牌上画的还要好。
    与自由市场这种资本主义商品经济的发展相对照，国营商店这块社会主义的破牌子愈来愈不象样子了。
    最近，爱沙尼亚共和国商业部副部长在《爱沙尼亚共产党人》杂志上发表的文章供认，只有共和国直属的城市才供应一点新鲜的和盐腌的白菜，其他地方根本买不到。商店、食堂、仓库的基本建设计划年年完不成。
    文章说，白菜、黄瓜、早蔬菜、水果和食品的供应远不能满足顾客的需求。合作社一连几年都没有完成腌白菜的计划。甚至有些合作社的代表从区里跑到首府塔林去购买腌白菜，以便节日前出售。
