Under the tremendous impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and guided by Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production," agricultural production in Qinghai Province is flourishing. According to relevant departments, the province's grain output this year is expected to increase by over 30% compared to last year, and the total oilseed production is expected to increase by 10%. In areas that often suffer from drought, such as Minhe, Huzhu, and Huangzhong counties, grain output is expected to double compared to last year. This is a victory for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Currently, the warm-temperature regions along the Yellow River and Huangshui River, such as Xunhua, Hualong, Guide, Jianzha, Minhe, Huzhu, and Huangzhong counties, are covered with golden waves of wheat stretching for thousands of miles. The full ears of wheat are a delight to behold, and some places have already begun harvesting. The August 18th Revolutionary Rebels and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, along with revolutionary cadres in the countryside, have put forward the slogan "Every grain back to the home, every blade of grass to the threshing floor," ensuring timely harvesting, thorough grain collection, meticulous threshing, and high-quality wheat harvesting. Revolutionary farmers of all ethnic groups, filled with the joy of a bumper harvest, say, "This year's great harvest is a result of the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao. We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great policy of preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people, and deliver more and better grain to the state."

    青海粮食将增产三成多
    据新华社西宁电　在无产阶级文化大革命巨大威力的推动下，在毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大方针的指导下，青海省农业生产呈现一片欣欣向荣的丰收景象。据有关部门估计，全省今年粮食产量将比去年增产三成多，油料总产量将比去年增产一成。往年经常干旱的民和、乐都、湟中等县的浅山地区粮食产量将比去年成倍增产。这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利，是无产阶级文化大革命的成果。
    目前，青海高原气温较暖的黄河、湟水两岸的循化、化隆、贵德、尖扎、民和、乐都、湟中等县，金黄的麦浪千里滚滚，饱满的麦穗令人喜爱，有些地方已经开镰收割。“八·一八”无产阶级革命派和广大贫下中农、农村革命干部，提出“颗粒还家、寸草归场”的口号，做到收割及时，拾粮干净，打粮精细，提高麦收质量。各族革命农民满怀丰收的喜悦心情说，今年的大丰收是伟大领袖毛主席领导我们取得的，我们一定要坚决贯彻毛主席备战、备荒、为人民的伟大方针，把更多更好的粮食交售给国家。
