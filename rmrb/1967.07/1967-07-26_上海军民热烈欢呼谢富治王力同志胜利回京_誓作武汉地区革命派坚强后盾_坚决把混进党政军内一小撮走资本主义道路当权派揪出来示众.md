In the birthplace of the "January Revolution," Shanghai, the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries, Red Guards, and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces stationed in Shanghai have held grand meetings and demonstrations over the past few days. They have expressed their utmost enthusiasm in welcoming Comrades Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li, who have triumphantly and honorably returned to Chairman Mao's side.

Today, along both banks of the Huangpu River, from factories to rural areas, from offices to schools, from shops to alleyways, gatherings and demonstrations are taking place everywhere. The strong will of Shanghai's ten million revolutionary people is being expressed: to thoroughly criticize, expose, and denounce the Chinese Khrushchev politically, ideologically, and theoretically; to join hands with the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan to expose and denounce the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road who have infiltrated the Party, government, and military; to unite and fight alongside the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan and across the country, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

Comrade Wang Shaoyong, a leading member of the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee, said: "The triumphant and honorable return of Comrades Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li to Chairman Mao's side is a great victory for the proletarian revolutionaries across the country and in Wuhan, a great victory for Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and a great victory for Mao Zedong Thought. This fact proves that the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is excellent and getting better. The counterattack by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party is merely a desperate struggle, and they will inevitably be buried in the vast ocean of the people's struggle."

The People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces stationed in Shanghai have held powerful and majestic demonstrations over the past few days, expressing their utmost determination to stand firmly behind the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan and fight shoulder to shoulder with them, to defeat the Chinese Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan! The leaders of the land, sea, and air forces stationed in Shanghai also issued statements today, welcoming Comrades Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li's triumphant and honorable return to Beijing, and firmly supporting the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan. They pointed out that the People's Liberation Army is a great army personally founded by the great leader Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. We are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and infinitely loyal to the people. Whoever dares to oppose Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, we will fight to the end and thoroughly defeat them! We will defend Chairman Mao with our lives, defend Vice Chairman Lin with our lives, and defend the Central Cultural Revolution Group with our lives! We will stand firmly behind the proletarian revolutionaries, firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan. We will raise the banner of revolutionary criticism even higher, criticize the Chinese Khrushchev politically, ideologically, and theoretically, thoroughly expose and denounce them, and completely defeat the biggest handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. We will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

The proletarian revolutionaries on various fronts in Shanghai, who are high-spiritedly raising the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launching a new wave of revolutionary criticism, are using big-character posters, wall newspapers, denunciation meetings, discussion meetings, and other forms to launch a total attack on the Chinese Khrushchev, denouncing the heinous crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and military in Wuhan. The center of the city, People's Square, has become a fierce battlefield for the annihilation of the Chinese Khrushchev over the past few days. Tens of thousands of revolutionary masses gather here every day. The slogans "Down with the Chinese Khrushchev!" "Defend Chairman Mao with our lives!" "Defend the Party Central Committee with our lives!" "Firmly support the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan!" "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line!" echo through the red skies of Shanghai. The revolutionary organizations of the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan stationed in Shanghai have gone to many factories, schools, and offices to introduce the excellent revolutionary situation in Wuhan and their heroic struggles against a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists to their Shanghai comrades, greatly inspiring the revolutionary people of Shanghai.

The representative of the Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters solemnly pledges to Chairman Mao on behalf of the Shanghai working class: "We pledge with our blood and lives to defend you, Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and the dictatorship of the proletariat. 'Only heroes can drive tigers and leopards, and no heroes fear bears and wolves.' Our hearts are connected with those of the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan. We firmly support all their revolutionary actions and together seize new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" The revolutionary masses of the Revolutionary Liaison Station of the Municipal Committee, the Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the Sports Front, the Revolutionary Rebel Committee of the Public Security Bureau, and other revolutionary mass organizations pointed out that whoever opposes the proletarian headquarters, we will fight to the end with them! Chairman Mao teaches us: "Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world towards the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." No matter what tricks the Chinese Khrushchev and his henchmen play, they cannot escape the fate of being thoroughly wiped out. The revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will surely sweep this handful of scoundrels into the dustbin of history!

In recent days, thousands to tens of thousands of revolutionary masses have taken to the streets in many county towns and market towns in the suburbs of Shanghai to hold demonstrations and parades. Some have sent telegrams of support to the revolutionary comrades in Wuhan. They unanimously expressed that the broad poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs of Shanghai will definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words, support the revolutionary struggle of the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan with actual actions of seizing revolution and promoting production.

The Red Guards of Shanghai, who have been at the forefront of the revolutionary criticism, have been boiling with indignation these days. The revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards of various universities, middle schools, and high schools such as Fudan University, Tongji University, No. 6 Girls' School, and Kongjiang Middle School, with hearts full of indignation, have used various weapons to verbally and in writing denounce the Chinese Khrushchev. They are determined to turn their hatred into pen tips, further launch a new wave of revolutionary criticism, and turn every revolutionary big-character poster into a heavy bomb, striking at the vital points of the Chinese Khrushchev.

The proletarian revolutionaries in the cultural circles of Shanghai have organized many Mao Zedong Thought art troupes over the past few days, rehearsed many art programs to denounce the Chinese Khrushchev and support the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan, and performed at grassroots units. During the performances, the slogans "Down with the Chinese Khrushchev!" and "Firmly support the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan!" echoed from the stage and the audience.

    上海军民热烈欢呼谢富治王力同志胜利回京
    誓作武汉地区革命派坚强后盾
    坚决把混进党政军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揪出来示众
    新华社上海二十五日电　在“一月革命”风暴发源地上海，无限忠于毛主席的广大无产阶级革命派、红卫兵小将和人民解放军陆海空三军驻沪部队广大指战员，连日来举行盛大的集会和示威游行，最最热烈地欢呼谢富治、王力同志胜利地光荣地回到毛主席身边。
    今天，黄浦江两岸，从工厂到农村，从机关到学校，从商店到街道里弄，到处都在举行集会、游行示威，最强烈地表达了上海一千万革命人民的坚强意志：坚决把中国的赫鲁晓夫从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒、批透、批臭；坚决同武汉地区的无产阶级革命派一道，把混进党里、政府里、军队里一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揪出来示众；坚决和武汉地区以及全国的无产阶级革命派团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    上海市革命委员会领导成员王少庸同志说：“谢富治、王力同志胜利地光荣地返回毛主席的身边，这是全国无产阶级革命派和武汉地区无产阶级革命派相互支援、共同斗争的伟大胜利，是毛主席的革命路线的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。这一事实雄辩地证明，无产阶级文化大革命形势大好，而且越来越好。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反扑，只是他们的一种绝望挣扎，最后必然被埋葬在人民斗争的汪洋大海之中。”
    中国人民解放军驻沪陆海空三军连日来举行了威武雄壮的强大示威，最最坚决地表示，誓作武汉地区无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾，和他们并肩战斗，把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人，打个落花流水！驻沪陆、海、空三军的负责人，今天也分别发表了谈话，欢呼谢富治同志和王力同志从武汉胜利地光荣地回到北京，坚决支持武汉地区的无产阶级革命派。他们指出，中国人民解放军是伟大领袖毛主席亲自缔造的、林副主席直接指挥的伟大军队。我们无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛主席的革命路线，无限忠于人民。谁要是胆敢反对毛主席，反对林副主席，反对中央文革，我们就坚决和他拚到底！彻底把他打倒！我们誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫林副主席，誓死保卫中央文革！我们誓作无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾，坚决支持武汉地区无产阶级革命派的革命斗争。我们一定要更高地举起革命的批判大旗，把中国的赫鲁晓夫从政治上、思想上、理论上批深批透，批倒批臭，彻底打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    正在高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗、掀起革命大批判新高潮的上海各条战线上的无产阶级革命派，利用大字报、墙报、声讨会、座谈会等各种形式，向中国的赫鲁晓夫发起了总攻击，声讨武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行。市中心的人民广场，这几天成了猛烈围剿中国赫鲁晓夫的大战场。每天都有数以十万计的革命群众在这里集会。“打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫！”“誓死保卫毛主席！”“誓死保卫党中央！”“坚决支持武汉地区无产阶级革命派！”“毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！”的口号声，震天动地，震荡在红色上海的上空。武汉地区无产阶级革命派组织在沪战士，分头到许多工厂、学校、机关，向上海战友介绍武汉地区大好革命形势，以及他们同一小撮反革命修正主义分子英勇斗争的事迹，极大地鼓舞了上海的革命人民。
    上海工人革命造反总司令部代表上海工人阶级向毛主席庄严宣誓：我们誓以鲜血和生命保卫您老人家，保卫党中央，保卫中央文革小组，保卫无产阶级专政。“独有英雄驱虎豹，更无豪杰怕熊罴。”我们和武汉地区无产阶级革命派心连心，坚决支持他们的一切革命行动，同他们一起夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利！市委机关革命造反联络站、上海体育战线革命造反司令部、上海市公安局革命造反委员会等革命群众组织的战士共同指出，谁反对无产阶级司令部，我们就坚决同他们拚到底！毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”不管中国的赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙耍什么阴谋诡计，他们都逃脱不了彻底灭亡的命运。用毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民必将把这一小撮坏蛋扫进历史的垃圾堆！
    上海郊区的许多县城、集镇，这几天不断有数以千计以至上万的革命群众涌上街头，举行示威游行，有的向武汉地区的革命派战友拍发了声援电报。他们一致表示，上海郊区广大贫下中农坚决听毛主席的话，以抓革命，促生产的实际行动，支持武汉地区无产阶级革命派的斗争。
    在革命大批判中充当急先锋的上海红卫兵小将，这几天个个热血沸腾，义愤填胸。复旦大学、同济大学、市六女中、控江中学等各个大、中学校的革命师生、红卫兵小将怀着怒不可遏的心情，运用各种武器，口诛笔伐中国的赫鲁晓夫。他们决心把仇恨凝结在笔尖上，进一步掀起革命大批判的新高潮，使每一张革命大字报都变成重磅炸弹，击中中国赫鲁晓夫的要害。
    上海文艺界的无产阶级革命派连日来组织了许多毛泽东思想文艺小分队，赶排了不少声讨中国赫鲁晓夫、支持武汉地区无产阶级革命派的文艺节目，到基层单位演出。演出过程中，台上台下“打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫！”“坚决支持武汉地区无产阶级革命派！”的口号声响成一片。
