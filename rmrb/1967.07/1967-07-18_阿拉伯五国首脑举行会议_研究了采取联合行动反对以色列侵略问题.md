The leaders of five Arab countries—Egypt, Syria, Algeria, Iraq, and Sudan—held a meeting in Cairo. After the meeting, a joint communiqué was issued on the evening of the 16th, stating that the meeting "discussed the current situation and the need for joint actions in the current phase of the Arab struggle to counter the aggression of Israel in collusion with American and British imperialist forces against the Arab people."

The communiqué expressed that, regardless of the difficulties encountered, the Arab nation is determined to achieve their just aspirations through struggle.

The communiqué pointed out, "Arab states and peoples must determine their relations with other countries based on the attitudes of these countries towards aggression and its consequences."

The five leaders also agreed to hold a meeting of Arab foreign ministers in the near future in Khartoum, the capital of Sudan.

The leaders who participated in this summit were Nasser, Atassi, Boumediene, Arif, and Azhari. The meeting began with Boumediene's arrival in Cairo on the 9th to hold bilateral talks with Nasser. The leaders of Iraq, Syria, and Sudan later joined the discussions.

During the talks, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Malik was active in Cairo.
