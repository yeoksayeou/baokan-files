The All-China Journalists Association today issued a statement strongly protesting the British colonial authorities' brazen "sentencing" of New China News Agency reporter Xue Ping to two years in prison and their illegal "interrogation" of other patriotic journalists. This fascist atrocity is a serious political provocation against the great socialist China and is absolutely intolerable to the 700 million Chinese people. The full text of the statement is as follows:

The British colonial fascist authorities, disregarding repeated serious warnings from the Chinese government and the news community, on the 19th again brazenly continued the illegal "interrogation" of our New China News Agency Hong Kong branch reporter Xue Ping, and dared to declare "guilt established," unreasonably "sentencing" Xue Ping to two years in prison. They also arbitrarily and unreasonably "interrogated" the illegally detained New China News Agency reporters Chen Fengying, Chen Demu, and five other patriotic journalists. This is a serious political provocation by the British colonial fascist authorities against the great socialist China, and is absolutely intolerable to the four million patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and the 700 million Chinese people. For this reason, the All-China Journalists Association strongly protests against the British colonial fascist authorities.

New China News Agency Hong Kong branch reporter Xue Ping was unlawfully abducted by the British colonial fascist authorities while conducting normal reporting activities in the Wan Chai district of Hong Kong in the early hours of July 11. The New China News Agency and the New China News Agency Hong Kong branch had issued statements, strongly protesting the fascist atrocities of the British colonial authorities and warning that Xue Ping must be immediately released. However, the British colonial authorities not only did not immediately release Xue Ping but instead escalated their actions, fabricating the so-called "illegal assembly" and "participation in a threatening assembly" charges, and illegally "sentencing" Xue Ping to two years in prison. This is another serious fascist atrocity by the British colonial fascist authorities following their beating of New China News Agency Hong Kong branch reporter Su Qiang on May 11, and their unreasonable obstruction and humiliating search of the branch's deputy editor Wang Lei and reporters Chen Guorong and Chen Mingzhu on June 29.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no real power." The British colonial fascist authorities' barbaric persecution of New China News Agency Hong Kong branch reporters and other patriotic journalists in Hong Kong is because they fear that the New China News Agency reporters and other patriotic journalists in Hong Kong will truthfully expose their fascist atrocities in Hong Kong to the world, and reveal the love of the Hong Kong patriotic compatriots for Chairman Mao and their heroic spirit in the struggle against violence to the world. But this is something you will absolutely not be able to do! On the contrary, your fascist atrocities will only further arouse the boundless anger of the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and the 700 million Chinese people, and you will receive double the punishment. To confront the great Chinese people armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought is to have no good ending!

We solemnly demand: The British colonial authorities must immediately and unconditionally release Xue Ping, immediately stop the "interrogation" of other detained patriotic journalists, and unconditionally release them. They must apologize to the victims, compensate for all losses, severely punish the perpetrators, and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again. If the British colonial authorities continue to act arbitrarily, all serious consequences arising therefrom must be fully borne by the British colonial authorities.

    中华全国新闻工作者协会发表声明
    最强烈抗议英帝疯狂迫害我记者
    严正要求立即无条件释放新华社记者薛平；立即停止“审讯”其他被捕爱国记者，并无条件释放他们
    新华社二十日讯　中华全国新闻工作者协会今天发表声明，强烈抗议港英当局悍然“判决”新华社记者薛平入狱两年和非法“审讯”其他爱国记者的法西斯暴行，指出这是港英法西斯当局对伟大社会主义中国的严重政治挑衅，是七亿中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。声明全文如下：
    港英法西斯当局无视我国政府和新闻界的一再严重警告，十九日又悍然对我新华社香港分社记者薛平继续进行非法“审讯”，并胆敢宣称“罪名成立”，无理“判决”薛平入狱两年，还蛮横无理地对被非法逮捕的新华社记者陈凤英、陈德穆和五名爱国记者进行所谓“审讯”。这是港英法西斯当局对伟大的社会主义中国的严重政治挑衅，是四百万香港爱国同胞和七亿中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。为此，中华全国新闻工作者协会对港英法西斯当局提出最最强烈的抗议。
    新华社香港分社记者薛平七月十一日凌晨在香港湾仔地区进行正常采访活动时，被港英法西斯当局无理绑架。新华社和新华社香港分社曾相继发表声明，严重抗议港英当局的法西斯暴行并警告港英当局必须立即释放薛平。而港英当局不但不立即释放薛平，反而变本加厉，一意孤行，编造了所谓“非法集会”和参加“恐吓性集会”的莫须有罪名，非法地加以“控告”。悍然“判决”薛平入狱两年。这是港英法西斯当局继五月十一日殴打新华社香港分社记者司徒强，六月二十九日对香港分社副总编辑王磊和记者陈国荣、陈明珠进行无理阻拦和侮辱性的搜查之后的又一次严重的法西斯暴行。
    毛主席教导我们说：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。”港英法西斯当局对新华社香港分社记者和香港其他爱国记者进行如此野蛮的迫害，是因为他们害怕新华社记者和香港其他爱国记者如实地把他们在香港犯下的法西斯暴行公诸于世，把香港爱国同胞对毛主席的热爱和在抗暴斗争中的英雄气概公诸于世。但是，这是你们绝对办不到的！相反，你们的法西斯暴行只能进一步激起香港爱国同胞和七亿中国人民的无比愤怒，并将受到加倍的惩罚。同用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国人民为敌，对你们是决没有好下场的！
    我们严正要求：港英当局必须立即无条件释放薛平，立即停止对其他被捕爱国记者的“审讯”并无条件释放他们，向受害者道歉，赔偿一切损失，严厉惩办肇事者，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。港英当局如果继续一意孤行，由此引起的一切严重后果，必须由港英当局全部承担。
