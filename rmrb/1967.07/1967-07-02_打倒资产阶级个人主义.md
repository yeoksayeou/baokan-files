	Overthrow Bourgeois Individualism
	Party Branch Secretary of Hongjin Brigade, Yang Mingsheng
	Brigade Leader, Sun Xiaoguan

	“Self-Cultivation” is a thoroughly bourgeois “business manual,” a big poisonous weed against Mao Zedong Thought. It talks about how to “enable party members to continuously develop and improve themselves in the revolutionary cause of the proletariat.” Unmasking the trick, this is nothing but the promotion of individualism, a roundabout way of advocating the bourgeois philosophy of life: “suffer a small loss to gain a big advantage.”

	Is doing revolution for the sake of “developing and improving oneself”? This is sheer nonsense. Both of us are poor peasants and are grassroots cadres who have risen during the cooperative movement. We have followed Chairman Mao in revolution for more than a decade. Looking back to 1955, we responded to Chairman Mao’s call to “organize together” and, to establish cooperatives, went everywhere to promote the cause. In the icy cold and snow, we took the lead in breaking the ice to gather fertilizer from the river, with blood gushing from our legs, but we felt no pain. In 1958, Chairman Mao issued the great call for “People’s Communes are good,” and we immediately responded. That autumn, the tasks of harvesting and sowing were very heavy, and we stayed away from home for a long time and went without sleep for several nights. Why were we so enthusiastic about establishing cooperatives and people’s communes? It was the strength given to us by Chairman Mao’s teaching of “wholeheartedly serving the people.” If it were for “suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage,” we would not have had such high revolutionary enthusiasm.

	In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Chairman Mao’s teachings again pointed out the direction for us to advance, making us realize that carrying out the Cultural Revolution well is the top priority for preventing personal degeneration and national change of color. By breaking away from selfish thoughts and establishing the greatest “public” spirit of defending Chairman Mao’s revolutionary line, we came to realize that the masses posting big-character posters to criticize us is a sign of the masses being mobilized and a victory for Mao Zedong Thought; we came to realize that when the masses criticize us, what we lose are only our shortcomings and errors, but what we gain is the red Mao Zedong Thought. In this way, we bravely went among the masses, abandoned selfishness to make revolution, and stood tall to grasp production. By doing so, we gained the trust and support of the masses. This living fact once again proves: only by being selfless can one be public-spirited. If one falls for the trick of “suffering a small loss to gain a big advantage” and allows individualist thoughts to rise, one cannot make revolution or advance.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: “Serve the people wholeheartedly, never leave the masses; everything should be based on the interests of the people, not on the interests of individuals or small groups.” Chairman Mao’s words shine with the brilliance of communism. The biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party advocate “developing and improving oneself” in “Self-Cultivation,” which is a rehash of the landlord and bourgeoisie’s fallacy of “small money not going, big money not coming.” This is fundamentally opposed to Chairman Mao’s teachings. If one follows “Self-Cultivation,” one will indeed become more and more corrupted, becoming hypocrites who appear to be revolutionary but are actually self-serving, becoming fake communists and true revisionists. This is how dangerous it is! Thinking of this, we harbor great class hatred towards the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party. We must raise the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought to overthrow bourgeois individualism. We must forever study the “Three Articles” as our guiding principles, serve the people wholeheartedly, closely follow Chairman Mao, and revolutionize for life.

### 打倒资产阶级个人主义

　　打倒资产阶级个人主义

    《修养》是一本地地道道的资产阶级的“生意经”，是反对毛泽东思想的大毒草。它说什么“使党员能够在无产阶级的革命事业中不断发展自己，提高自己”。拆穿“西洋镜”，这就是宣扬个人主义，转弯抹角地提倡“吃小亏占大便宜”的资产阶级人生哲学。
    干革命难道是为了“发展自己，提高自己”吗？这完全是胡说八道。我们俩都是贫农，是合作化运动中起来的基层干部，跟着毛主席闹了十多年革命。回想一九五五年，我们响应毛主席“组织起来”的号召，为了办合作社，到处奔走。冰天雪地里带头破冰下河积肥，腿上鲜血直冒，但一点不觉得痛。一九五八年，毛主席发出“人民公社好”的伟大号召，我们又马上响应。那年秋收秋种任务十分繁重，我们长期不回家，几夜不睡觉。我们为什么那么起劲地办合作社、办人民公社呢？这是毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务”的教导给我们的力量。要是为了“吃小亏占大便宜”，我们早就没有那样高的革命积极性了。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，毛主席的教导又指明了我们前进的方向，使我们认识到，搞好文化大革命是使我们个人不变质、国家不变色的头等大事。破除了私心杂念，树立了捍卫毛主席革命路线这个最大的“公”字，我们就认识到群众贴大字报对我们提批评意见，是群众发动起来了，是毛泽东思想的胜利；我们就认识到群众批评我们，我们失去的只是缺点错误，得到的却是红彤彤的毛泽东思想。这样，我们就勇敢地走到群众里面去，丢掉私心闹革命，挺起腰杆抓生产。我们这样做了，就得到群众的信任和支持。这个活生生的事实再一次证明：无私才能为公，要是上了“吃小亏占大便宜”的当，个人主义思想抬头，就不能革命，不能前进。
    毛主席教导我们：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”。毛主席的话，字字句句闪耀着共产主义的光辉。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在《修养》中提倡“发展自己，提高自己”，是地主、资产阶级“小钱不去，大钱不来”的谬论的翻版，和毛主席的教导是根本对立的。要是照了《修养》去做，那真要越养越修，成为表面为革命，实际为自己的伪君子，成为假共产党员、真修正主义分子。这是多么危险的事情！想到这一点，我们对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，怀有极大的阶级仇恨。我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，打倒资产阶级个人主义。我们要永远把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，全心全意为人民服务，紧跟毛主席，革命一辈子。
