	“We Were Truly Cornered”
		U.S. Newspaper Reports on the Defeat of American “Dandy Soldiers” in a “Sweep”

	According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, a gang of American river gunboats launched a “sweep” in the Mekong Delta region of Long An Province. However, this fleet of cowardly American “dandy soldiers” was thoroughly defeated by the heroic Vietnamese South Liberation Armed Forces.

	According to a report published in the American magazine *Newsweek*, the incident occurred on a recent morning. This river gunboat fleet, boasting of being “highly mobile,” consisting of six barges loaded with sandbags and equipped with howitzers, carried the invading troops of the Fourth Battalion of the Ninth Infantry Division of the U.S. military. They launched an attack on the Mekong Delta, aiming to “eradicate all the Liberation Armed Forces on the rivers and marshes south of Saigon.”

	Initially, the invading troops reported smooth progress. However, “good times don’t last,” and soon this gunboat fleet “stumbled into a hornet’s nest of Liberation Army forces.” The invading troops, filled with great trepidation, “inched their way forward through the soft, muddy rice fields, hour after hour, without encountering a single Liberation Armed Forces member.” By noon, the American troops had crossed a vast expanse of rice fields and then approached a riverside lined with palm trees. When they were about a hundred yards from the forest, the Liberation Armed Forces opened fire. Bullets rained from the front and back of the palm grove, pinning the American troops down in the rice fields.

	The report, quoting the surviving American soldiers and officers, described the scene of their defeat. A platoon leader said, “In the initial contact, about fifty of my men were wounded, and some of them died immediately.” A private said, “We were truly cornered and had to hide in the water.”

	The report acknowledged that at this point, the situation seemed hopeless. Helicopters flew in to try to evacuate the wounded, but four helicopters in succession were shot down by the Liberation Armed Forces. The report reluctantly admitted that the U.S. military had indeed suffered a heavy defeat, and “other river attack forces attempted to track down the Liberation Armed Forces but saw no trace of them…”

    “我们简直是无路可走”
    美国报刊报道美国少爷兵“扫荡”挨揍记
    据新华社讯　美国强盗的一支内河炮艇攻击队向湄公河三角洲的隆安省一带发动“扫荡”，但是这个舰队的贪生怕死的美国少爷兵在“扫荡”中被英雄的越南南方解放武装力量打得落花流水。
    据美国《新闻周刊》发表的一篇通讯报道，事情发生在不久前的一个早晨，美国这支号称“强劲机动”的内河炮艇队，（共六艘堆放着沙袋、配备有榴弹炮的驳艇）载着第九步兵师第四营的美国侵略军，向湄公河三角洲出击，它妄图“把西贡以南所有在河上和沼泽地的解放武装力量除草拔根。”
    这支侵略军出击之初，“不断报告顺利”，但是“好景不常，接着，这支炮艇队就闯进了解放军的蚂蜂窝”。这支侵略军“怀着极大的戒惧心情”，“在软滑泥泞的稻田一步一步摸索前进，行了一小时又一小时，始终未遇见个解放武装力量”。直到中午，这支美国兵横过广阔的稻田，然后向着一处种有棕榈树的河岸靠近，当走到离树林约一百码时解放武装力量开火了，子弹从棕榈树林的前前后后发出来，把美军“钉死在稻田里”。
    这篇通讯援引还没有被打死的美军官兵追述这次惨败的情景时，报道了一个连长的一段话：“在初步的接触中，我的部下大约有五十人受伤了，有一部分受伤后随即毙命”。一个一等兵说：“我们简直是无路可走，只好藏身水底。”
    通讯承认“这时候，情况看来已经无望了。直升飞机飞来试图把伤者撤走，但是接连四架直升飞机又被解放武装力量击落了”。这篇通讯无可奈何地承认，美军确实“遭受了一次惨重的失败”，“而其他的内河攻击队试图追踪那些解放武装力量，却看不见他们的踪影……”。
