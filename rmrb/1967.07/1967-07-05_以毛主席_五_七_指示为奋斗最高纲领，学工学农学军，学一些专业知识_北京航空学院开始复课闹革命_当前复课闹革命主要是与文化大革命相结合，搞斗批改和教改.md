Beijing Aeronautical Institute Begins Classes Amid Revolution

The current focus on resuming classes amid revolution is to combine it with the Cultural Revolution, focusing on struggle, criticism, reform, and educational reform.

BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) — On July 3, Beijing Aeronautical Institute began classes amid revolution.

The Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Aeronautical Institute decided on June 27 to resume classes amid revolution, which was supported by all revolutionary teachers and students. On July 2, Comrade Han Aijing explained the issue of resuming classes amid revolution at a meeting of all teachers, students, and staff. He said: This time, resuming classes amid revolution is tentatively scheduled from July 3 to September 1, starting with major criticism and gradually transitioning to "learning as the main focus." Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive is our highest goal. Studying work, agriculture, military affairs, and some professional knowledge is the content of teaching for resuming classes amid revolution. Studying work, agriculture, and military affairs can be done both on and off campus, with a current focus on on-campus learning, gradually transitioning to off-campus learning. These are the main courses, not "side jobs." Comrade Han Aijing called on all revolutionary teachers and students to take action, use their brains, dare to practice, and dare to innovate.

The Revolutionary Committee of Beijing Aeronautical Institute believes that the current focus on resuming classes amid revolution is not on resuming professional courses but on combining it with the Cultural Revolution, focusing on struggle, criticism, reform, and educational reform. Their plan is: before mid-July, focus on struggle and criticism; after mid-July, focus on reform. July and August are transition periods, and full classes will resume on September 1.

The classes amid revolution at Beijing Aeronautical Institute are led by the Revolutionary Committees of the institute and departments, with the Operations Department of the institute's Revolutionary Committee taking specific responsibility. Teachers and students participate in activities together according to their specialties. They did not prepare a plan in advance but started by learning from the masses, practicing, summarizing, and improving. Currently, they have four classes a day. The schedule is: wake up at 6 AM, read Chairman Mao's works for half an hour, and do morning exercises for half an hour. The first class in the morning (two hours) is to study Chairman Mao's works, and the second class (two hours) is to criticize three days a week and study professional courses three days a week. The third class in the afternoon (two hours) is to study work, agriculture, and military affairs once a week, respectively, with the remaining three days arranged by each department. The fourth class in the evening (two and a half hours) is to carry out the cultural revolution movement.

On July 3, the first day of resuming classes amid revolution at Beijing Aeronautical Institute, the campus showed a new atmosphere. In the morning, students woke up on time, read Chairman Mao's works together, and did morning exercises. In the afternoon, students went to the classroom to further discuss how to resume classes amid revolution. In the afternoon, they studied work, agriculture, and military affairs. Due to scheduling issues, only three out of the eight departments in the entire institute organized activities: the first department worked in the on-campus factory, the second department studied military affairs and went swimming, and the third department worked in the production brigade. Students were in high spirits and found it very novel.

The resuming of classes amid revolution at Beijing Aeronautical Institute is an initial attempt, and due to the short preparation time, there are still many problems. For example, how to teach professional courses, criticism courses, and military courses? Where to arrange work and agricultural labor (the on-campus training factory can only accommodate one or two hundred people)? Students also have opinions on the time arrangement, feeling it is too tight and rigid. Some suggest not having work, agriculture, and military studies once a week but concentrating on a few days. On the first day of work and agricultural labor, some people went but had no work to do. Students said: "After all, we are groping our way forward, and if it's wrong, we will change it."

　　以毛主席“五·七”指示为奋斗最高纲领，学工学农学军，学一些专业知识
　　北京航空学院开始复课闹革命
　　当前复课闹革命主要是与文化大革命相结合，搞斗批改和教改
    本报讯　七月三日，北京航空学院开始复课闹革命。
    北航革命委员会在六月二十七日作出复课闹革命的决定，得到了全院广大革命师生的拥护。七月二日，韩爱晶同志在全院师生员工大会上就复课闹革命问题作了解释。他说：这次复课闹革命暂时安排为七月三日至九月一日，先以大批判为主，逐步过渡到“以学为主”。毛主席的“五·七”指示是我们奋斗的最高纲领，学工、学农、学军、学一些专业知识，是复课闹革命的教学内容。学工、学农、学军可以在校内学，也可以在校外学，当前以校内学为主，逐步过渡到以校外为主。这些是主课，不是“副业”。韩爱晶同志号召全院革命师生行动起来，开动脑筋，敢于实践，敢于创造。
    北航革委会认为，当前复课闹革命，主要不是复业务课，而是与文化大革命相结合，搞斗、批、改和教改。他们的安排是：七月中旬以前以斗、批为主，七月中旬以后以改为主。七、八两月作为过渡阶段，九月一日以后全面复课。
    北航的复课闹革命由院、系革委会领导，院革委会作战部具体负责。教师按专业和同学们一起活动。他们并没有事先搞出一套方案，而是先上马，从群众中来，到群众中去，边实践，边总结，边改进。目前，他们一天上四节课。时间安排是：早晨六点起床，读半小时毛主席著作，半小时早操。上午第一节课（两小时）学习毛主席著作，第二节课（两小时），每周三天搞批判，三天学业务。下午第三节课（两小时），每周一次学工、一次学农、一次学军，另外三天各系自行安排。晚上第四节课（两个半小时），搞文化革命运动。
    七月三日，北航复课闹革命第一天，校园内出现了一片新气象。早晨，同学们都按时起床，一起读毛主席著作，作早操。上午，同学们都走进教室，进一步讨论如何复课闹革命。下午学工、学农、学军，由于安排不过来，全院八个系，只组织了三个系的活动。即：一系在校内工厂劳动，二系学军，步行去游泳，三系到生产大队劳动。同学们情绪很高，觉得很新鲜。
    北航复课闹革命是初次尝试，加上时间仓促，准备不足，所以还存在许多问题。例如：业务课、批判课、军事课怎么上？工、农业劳动安排到哪里去（校内一个实习工厂只能容纳一、二百人）？同学们对时间安排也有意见，认为太紧、太死。有的认为，学工、学农、学军不要一周搞一次，集中搞几天好。第一天搞工、农业劳动因没有联系好，不少人去了没有活干。同学们说：“反正咱们是摸索着干，不对就改。”
