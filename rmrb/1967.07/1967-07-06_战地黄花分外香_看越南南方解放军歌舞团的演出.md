The revolutionary cultural warriors of the South Vietnam Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe came to our country for a visit and performance, and were able to live and fight alongside us Chinese Red Guards. This made us extremely happy! Although our time together was short, we will never forget this gathering. As you often say, "We are one family." Yes, we are one family, brothers who share life and death!

Who says our languages are not the same? The peoples of China and Vietnam, connected by mountains and rivers, are as close as brothers and sisters, heart to heart. Every song and dance of yours, we understand, because the performances on stage are a true reflection of our shared struggle! When we saw the female guerrillas in the dance "The Female Guerrillas of Tan Trao" fighting and killing American aggressors, we wanted to rush onto the stage and fight alongside you! The female guerrillas of Tan Trao are so brave, using simple weapons to defeat fully armed American aggressors. This is the power of people's war, this is the spirit of the people of South Vietnam! The people of South Vietnam are unyielding. Fire can only burn down fields and houses, but it can never shake the resolve of the people of South Vietnam to resist America and save the country. The dance "The Victory Flag Flies High" shows the heroic spirit of the people of South Vietnam, fearless and unyielding. Look! On the battlefield ablaze with fire, the heroic South Vietnam Liberation Army advances. One soldier falls, and another group rushes forward. They are fearless, unafraid of sacrifice, fearless in the face of gunfire and bullets. Finally, they defeat the enemy, and the victory flag flies high in the bright sunlight.

Who says our languages are different? The brilliance of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought unites our fighting friendship. During rehearsals and during breaks, as soon as we open "Quotations from Chairman Mao," you quickly come over, give a thumbs up, and murmur the most brilliant name in the world—Chairman Mao. The performance is about to begin, and you still recite Chairman Mao's quotations with us: "Resolutely carry out the decision, fear no sacrifice, overcome all difficulties, and strive for victory." With this spirit, you memorized two Chinese songs in less than half a day. From this, we see your fighting style: go where you go, perform where you go. As long as the revolution needs it, no difficulty can be overcome!

Who says our songs are different? The stirring battle song "Liberate the South" has long been a favorite of the Chinese people and the Red Guards. This is not just a song; it is a battle hymn written in blood and life. For this reason, we particularly like the song "Marching Towards Saigon" performed by Comrade Chen Yong. The song takes us into dense forests and battlefields. We seem to see the heroic soldiers of the South Vietnam Liberation Army advancing bravely. They are so brave, so fearless, so magnificent. With such revolutionary soldiers, the final victory will surely belong to the revolutionary people of Vietnam!

Dear comrades, you are not only performers but also warriors in the struggle against American imperialism. You not only brought wonderful performances but also brought the unyielding will and fighting spirit of the people of South Vietnam to resist America and save the country! Your performances are battle songs, victory reports, inspiring the people to bravely join the fight. Your performances are mirrors and cannonballs, exposing the ugly face of American aggressors and striking down the counter-revolutionary arrogance of these fascist bandits. Your successful performances and your revolutionary fighting spirit are all worthy of our learning.

After the South Vietnam Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe's cultural warriors and our revolutionary youth held a get-together, they exchanged souvenirs with each other.

The cultural warriors of the South Vietnam Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe joined hands and stood shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary cultural warriors of the Beijing-based army, navy, and air force units, gathering closely together.

With deep hatred for the evil landlord class, the cultural warriors of the South Vietnam Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe visited the large clay sculpture exhibition "The Rent Collection Courtyard."

　　战地黄花分外香
　　——看越南南方解放军歌舞团的演出
　　红代会中央音乐学院红岩兵团红卫兵
    越南南方解放军歌舞团的革命文艺战士来我国进行访问演出，而且能够和我们中国红卫兵生活在一起，战斗在一起，这使我们感到非常高兴！我们相处的时间虽然很短，但我们永远也不会忘怀这次团聚。正如你们常说的，“我们是一家人”。是的，我们就是一家人，就是生死与共的亲兄弟！
    谁说我们语言不通！山水相连的中越两国人民亲如手足，心连心。你们的每一首歌每一个舞，我们都看得懂，因为舞台上的节目就是我们共同的斗争生活的真实写照！当看到你们的舞蹈《同塔梅的女游击队》里的女游击队员痛杀美国强盗时，我们真想冲上前去，和你们一起战斗！同塔梅的女游击队员多英勇啊，靠着一支支极简陋的武器战胜了全副武装的美国强盗，这就是人民战争的威力，这就是越南南方人民的气概！越南南方人民是不屈服的，烈火只能烧毁田野房屋，但绝对动摇不了越南南方人民抗美救国的决心。舞蹈《胜利的大旗高高飘扬》表现了越南南方人民一往直前、无所畏惧的英雄气概。看！烈火熊熊的战场上，英雄的越南南方解放军在前进，一个战士倒下去，一群战士又冲上前，前仆后继，不怕牺牲，枪林弹雨无所畏惧，最后终于击溃了敌人，胜利的大旗高高地飘扬在阳光灿烂的晴空。
    谁说我们的文字不同！马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的光辉把我们的战斗友谊凝成一体。在排练过程中，在演出休息时，我们一打开《毛主席语录》，你们就赶紧走过来，伸出大拇指，嘴里喃喃地念着世界上最光辉的名字——毛主席。演出就要开始了，你们还和我们一起背诵毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”你们凭着这股精神，在不到半天的时间里用中文背熟了两首中国歌曲。从这里，我们看到了你们的战斗风格：走到哪儿，演到哪儿，只要革命需要，再大的困难也能克服！
    谁说我们的歌声不一样！《解放南方》这首激动人心的战歌早就成为中国人民和红卫兵喜爱的歌曲。因为这不是一般的歌曲，这是用鲜血和生命谱写的战斗的乐章。也正因为这样，我们非常喜欢陈勇同志演唱的《向西贡前进》这首歌。歌声把我们带进了密密的森林，带到了战火纷飞的原野。我们仿佛看到英雄的越南南方解放军战士在勇猛地前进，他们是那样的英勇，那样的无畏，那样的豪迈，有着这样的革命战士，最后胜利一定属于革命的越南人民！
    亲爱的战友们，你们是演员，也是反美斗争的战士。你们不仅带来了精彩的节目，而且带来了越南南方人民抗美救国的坚强信念和战斗精神！你们演出的节目是一支支战歌，一张张捷报，鼓舞着人民勇敢地投入战斗。你们的演出是一面面镜子，一发发炮弹，照出了美国侵略者的狰狞面目，打击了这伙法西斯匪徒的反革命气焰。你们成功的演出和你们的革命战斗精神，都值得我们学习。（附图片）
