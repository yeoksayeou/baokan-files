The proletarian revolutionary factions in the Wuhan region and the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Wuhan, who stand firmly with the proletarian revolutionary factions, have forged an even deeper friendship in the struggle to smash the frenzied counterattack by China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan. On the eve of the 40th anniversary of the founding of the People's Liberation Army, which holds great historical significance, the people of Wuhan have launched a massive "supporting the army and loving the people" campaign. The People's Liberation Army loves the proletarian revolutionary factions the most, and the proletarian revolutionary factions love the People's Liberation Army the most. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers say: Clearly and unreservedly supporting the proletarian revolutionary factions is the greatest form of "loving the people." The proletarian revolutionary factions say: Standing shoulder to shoulder with the People's Liberation Army to fight resolutely against China's Khrushchev, resolutely against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army, resolutely against the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line, and carrying the Cultural Revolution through to the end is the greatest form of "supporting the army."

In recent days, the three towns of Wuhan, both banks of the Yangtze River, factories, enterprises, government agencies, and schools have seen many moving scenes of the army loving the people and the people supporting the army. The army and the people study together, work together, and hold joint celebrations. Together, they criticize China's Khrushchev and denounce the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army in Wuhan, as well as the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line.

At the joint celebration held by the proletarian revolutionary factions of "Steel General," "Steel Second Command," "Steel September 13," military academies in the Wuhan region, the proletarian revolutionary factions of the Wuhan arts and culture sector, and the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, the proletarian revolutionary factions repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's instructions: "Without an army of the people, there can be nothing of the people." The representative of the People's Liberation Army executing the task of supporting the left said excitedly: It is Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line that have brought us together. You are the true proletarian revolutionary factions in the Wuhan region. You hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, defend Chairman Mao, defend Vice Chairman Lin, defend the Party Central Committee, defend the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. You are truly the reliable successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause. We stand firmly on your side and unreservedly support all your revolutionary actions, vowing to be your strong backbone.

"New Steel Workers," "New Lake University," "New Steel Farmers," "Three Commands Revolutionary Alliance," and many factories, schools, and government agencies have also held celebrations and discussions with the officers and soldiers of the stationed People's Liberation Army in recent days, sharing their gains and experiences from the Cultural Revolution. The revolutionary mass organizations "Steel Second Command" and "New Steel Workers" have even established "Supporting the Army and Loving the People" offices and organized reporting teams to go to the troops and report on the situation of the Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan region, which has been warmly welcomed by the broad ranks of officers and soldiers. In the struggle against the frenzied counterattack by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army in Wuhan, the proletarian revolutionary factions of the Wuhan Steel Company and the officers and soldiers of the stationed People's Liberation Army have forged a deep class friendship. The fighters of the "Steel September 13" Combat Brigade said: "During the days when dark clouds hung over the three towns of Wuhan, the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army and we revolutionary rebels stood together and fought together. We have formed an inseparable bond with the officers and soldiers. We deeply feel that revolutionary rebels cannot do without the People's Liberation Army."

The proletarian revolutionary factions of the provincial direct organs recently held a discussion with the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army. The proletarian revolutionary fighters said at the meeting: We proletarian revolutionary factions have always been heart to heart with the People's Liberation Army. Currently, in our struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army in the Wuhan region, we cannot achieve victory without the People's Liberation Army as our strong backbone. In the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army play all sorts of tricks, attempting to sabotage the flesh-and-blood relationship between the proletarian revolutionary factions and the People's Liberation Army, but their plots will never succeed. The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army also expressed at the meeting that they would resolutely support the revolutionary factions and be their strong backbone. The support-left troops stationed in Wuhan have also actively launched activities to learn from the proletarian revolutionary factions in recent days. They have invited revolutionary youngsters to the troops to report on their heroic struggles and denounce the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army in the Wuhan region. The officers and soldiers, after listening to the reports, have deepened their feelings for the proletarian revolutionary factions and strengthened their resolve to support the left.

The launch of the "supporting the army and loving the people" campaign has brought the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army even closer together, concentrating their efforts to direct the spearhead of the struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan region. They jointly denounce the evil plots of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army in the Wuhan region to sabotage military-civilian relations, and jointly celebrate the new great victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Qian Yunchun, the former platoon leader of Comrade Qiu Shaoyun, said excitedly: The more we interact with the proletarian revolutionary factions, the more we feel close to them from the heart, the more we talk with them, the more our hearts are connected. The proletarian revolutionary factions said: The more we interact with the officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, the more we feel that the People's Liberation Army, personally created by Chairman Mao and directly commanded by Vice Commander Lin, is truly a great people's army. We must stand together with the People's Liberation Army, fight shoulder to shoulder, and together thoroughly fight down, fight over, and fight stinky the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army in the Wuhan region and China's Khrushchev, and carry the Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan region through to the end!

    坚决相信坚决依靠解放军进行文化大革命是最大的“拥军”
    武汉军民最热烈地开展拥军爱民活动
    新华社三十日讯　武汉地区无产阶级革命派和中国人民解放军驻武汉陆、海、空三军紧紧与无产阶级革命派站在一起的广大指战员，在粉碎中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人的猖狂反扑中，结成了更加深厚的友谊。在具有伟大历史意义的中国人民解放军建军四十周年前夕，武汉军民掀起了声势浩大的“拥军爱民”活动。人民解放军最热爱无产阶级革命派，无产阶级革命派最热爱人民解放军。广大指战员说：旗帜鲜明地、不折不扣地、毫不含糊地坚决支持无产阶级革命派，是最大的“爱民”。无产阶级革命派说：紧紧地同中国人民解放军并肩战斗，坚决打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫，坚决打倒党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，坚决打倒武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，坚决打倒“百万雄师”中一小撮坏头头，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，是最大的“拥军”。
    连日来，武汉三镇，大江两岸，厂矿企业、机关、学校，出现了许多军爱民、民拥军的动人场面。军民一起学习，同劳动，同联欢，一起批判中国的赫鲁晓夫，一起控诉武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和“百万雄师”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头。
    在武汉“钢工总”、“钢二司”、“钢九·一三”、武汉地区军事院校的无产阶级革命派、武汉市文艺界无产阶级革命派和解放军指战员举行的军民联欢大会上，无产阶级革命派一遍又一遍地学习毛主席的指示：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”执行支左任务的解放军代表激动地说：是毛泽东思想、是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把我们紧紧联结在一起。你们是武汉地区真正的无产阶级革命派。你们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，保卫毛主席，保卫林副主席，保卫党中央，保卫中央文革，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。你们不愧为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。我们坚决站在你们一边，毫不含糊地支持你们的一切革命行动，誓作你们的坚强后盾。“新华工”、“新湖大”、“新华农”、“三司革联”以及许多工厂、学校、机关，连日来也纷纷与驻地解放军指战员举行联欢、座谈，畅谈无产阶级文化大革命的收获、体会。“钢二司”、“新华工”等革命群众组织还专门成立了“拥军爱民”办公室，组织了向解放军汇报团，到部队向指战员介绍武汉地区文化大革命的斗争情况，受到广大指战员的热烈欢迎。在反击武汉党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派疯狂反扑的斗争中，武汉钢铁公司的无产阶级革命派和驻地解放军指战员结下了深厚的阶级友谊。“钢九·一三”战斗兵团的战士说：“在乌云笼罩武汉三镇的日子里，解放军指战员和我们革命造反派团结在一起，战斗在一起。我们和指战员们结成了鱼水不能分离的感情。我们深深体会到，革命造反派一步也不能离开解放军。”
    省直属机关的无产阶级革命派，最近同解放军指战员举行座谈。无产阶级革命派战士们在会上说，我们无产阶级革命派同解放军一向心连心。当前我们同武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作斗争，没有解放军作坚强后盾，是不能胜利的。在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争过程中，党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派玩弄种种花招，妄图破坏无产阶级革命派同解放军的血肉关系，他们的阴谋是永远不会得逞的。解放军战士也在会上表示，要坚决支持革命派，做革命派的坚强后盾。驻武汉的支左部队，最近还积极开展了向无产阶级革命派学习的活动，他们邀请革命小将到部队报告英勇斗争的事迹，控诉武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。干部、战士听了报告，更加深了对无产阶级革命派的感情，增强了支持左派的决心。
    “拥军爱民”活动的开展，使无产阶级革命派和人民解放军广大指战员更加紧密地团结起来，集中力量，把斗争的矛头对准中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人。他们共同愤怒声讨武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派破坏军民关系的罪恶阴谋，共同欢呼战无不胜的毛泽东思想的新的伟大胜利。邱少云生前所在班班长甘永万激动地说：越和无产阶级革命派接触，越从内心感到无产阶级革命派亲，越与他们谈心，越与他们心连心。无产阶级革命派说：越与人民解放军指战员接触，越体会到人民解放军不愧为毛主席亲手缔造的、林副统帅直接指挥的伟大的人民军队。我们一定要和解放军团结在一起，并肩战斗，共同把武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和中国的赫鲁晓夫彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，把武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
