After achieving revolutionary unity based on teaching classes in Haidian District, Beijing's Xiangyang Middle School, the revolutionary teachers and students, while engaging in revolutionary criticism and the campaign to resume classes and make revolution, launched a high tide of thrift for revolution. The students repaired damaged public property with their own hands. Even at ten o'clock in the evening, some students were still repairing desks, chairs, doors, and windows. Soldiers urged them to go back and rest, but they said: "We have to resume classes and make revolution during the day, and there's no time. We use the gaps in the evening to fix things, so we don't have to find workers again."

The revolutionary teachers and students of this school also used collected bricks, tiles, and wood to build a kitchen. Since there were not enough tools for mixing mud, the students used their hands. The teachers also helped by passing bricks and carrying tiles. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's instruction to "make revolution through thrift," cut down on expenses, spend less and do more, and use their own hands to transform the school's appearance.

    用自己的双手改造学校面貌
    北京市海淀区向阳中学以教学班为基础实现革命的大联合后，在进行革命的大批判、复课闹革命的同时，掀起了节约闹革命的高潮。师生们自己动手修补损坏了的公物。晚上十点多，部分同学还在修补桌凳门窗。解放军同志催他们回去休息。他们说：白天复课闹革命，时间紧，晚上利用空隙修一修，省得再找工人。
    这个学校的革命师生还利用收集起来的砖瓦木材，修了一间厨房。和泥的工具不够，同学们就用手来和。教师们也帮助递砖运瓦。他们决心遵照毛主席“要节约闹革命”的教导，压缩开支，少花钱多办事，用自己的双手，改造学校的面貌。　向阳中学军训队
