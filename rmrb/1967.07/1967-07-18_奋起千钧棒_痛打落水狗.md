A massive wave of exposure, criticism, and struggle against the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party is sweeping across Beijing, the cradle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the residence of our great leader Chairman Mao. Revolutionary cadres, workers, peasants, Red Guards, students, and revolutionary officials on the front lines of the revolutionary criticism movement are heeding Chairman Mao's great teaching to "carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." They are displaying a thorough revolutionary spirit of smashing the fallen dogs, determined to expose and criticize the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party thoroughly in political, ideological, and theoretical terms, ensuring that these class enemies are reviled for eternity and never rise again!

The broad masses of revolutionary cadres and the people of Beijing have clearly recognized that the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party are a bunch of thoroughgoing counter-revolutionary revisionists whose counter-revolutionary nature will never change. Although these elements have been exposed by the revolutionary masses and have become "fallen dogs," they are still alive and unrepentant, constantly seeking opportunities to stage a comeback, attempting to regain power, and exact class revenge. If their counter-revolutionary restoration plots succeed, the revolutionary cadres and the revolutionary masses will be beheaded, the brilliant achievements of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will be in vain, and our socialist motherland will change color. Therefore, we must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teaching: "Do not pity the snake-like evil people." We must never show the slightest mercy to the "fallen dogs" for their feigned pitiful appearance and slacken our efforts. The broad masses of revolutionary cadres have pointed out that whether we can carry out a good revolutionary criticism and thoroughly expose and criticize the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party is a major issue concerning whether the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution will be carried through to the end or be abandoned halfway. It is a major issue concerning the future of the Chinese revolution and the fate of all humanity. We must hoist high the banner of revolutionary criticism, wield the mighty rod of Mao Zedong Thought, and expose and criticize the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party thoroughly, smashing them completely. We must thoroughly purge the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line they have spread in various fields and firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

In recent days, factories, rural people's communes, schools, government agencies, and troops stationed in Beijing have been filled with a strong atmosphere of revolutionary criticism. Revolutionary cadres and the broad masses of revolutionary people, with a common enemy, are fighting with high spirits, denouncing and criticizing in writing and speech, and launching a broader and deeper criticism movement against the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party. They are holding struggle-criticism meetings, posting big-character posters and big slogans, and writing criticism articles for newspapers. Under the common goal of criticizing the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party, more and more revolutionary organizations have stopped "fighting each other" and have sought common ground while reserving differences, achieving great unity. They are further studying Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought as their guide, conducting serious investigations and in-depth criticism of the words and deeds of these class enemies, and gradually combining their struggle-criticism-reform with their own units. Their battle cry is: "It is better to pursue the fleeing enemy than to imitate King Xiang Yu and seek fame." "Display the thorough revolutionary spirit of smashing the fallen dogs and thoroughly expose and criticize the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party!"

Revolutionary criticism has become a central task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Beijing University, Tsinghua University, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Geological Institute, and other higher educational institutions in the capital, as well as in secondary schools that have resumed classes and are making revolution. The warriors of the "New August 1st" combat team of Beijing Institute of Building Materials are filled with indignation and burning with rage, launching a fierce attack on the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party. In early August last year, the No. 1 capitalist-roader within the Party came to this school for so-called "pointing work," openly opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and pushing the bourgeois reactionary line. The revolutionary teachers and students have long hated him to the core. They say, China's Khrushchev, the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party, are a bunch of extremely reactionary wolves, just like all reactionaries, "if you don't hit them, they won't fall," and they will never voluntarily retire from the historical stage. We must not be too bookish and must not have the slightest pity for these "fallen dogs" within the Party but must draw our swords and load our guns, pursuing and attacking them relentlessly, criticizing them thoroughly, and not stopping until we achieve complete victory! The revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, who were the first to implement the resumption of classes and make revolution, have taken revolutionary criticism as the central task of the resumption of classes and making revolution. They have hoisted high the banner of revolutionary criticism, launching a new wave of writing big-character posters and criticism articles. They have taken up their pens as weapons, and in a few days, they have turned the campus of Beiyang into an ocean of big-character posters denouncing the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party. The warriors of the Red Flag Combat Team and the revolutionary teachers and students of Beiyang say that whether or not one actively participates in this criticism and struggle movement is a touchstone for distinguishing revolutionaries from non-revolutionaries and revolutionaries from "idlers." Every warrior of the Red Flag and revolutionary teacher and student must study Chairman Mao's works seriously, think independently, and participate in the revolutionary criticism with the spirit of continuous fighting without fatigue, exerting their strength in the criticism and struggle.

The revolutionary cadres on the industrial and transportation front in the capital are launching an important battle, which is to expose and criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist "Seventy Articles on Industry" in depth. Since early June, many revolutionary workers have held discussion meetings, accusation meetings, and criticism meetings, using big-character posters, wall newspapers, and other forms to actively participate in this battle. Recently, they have held struggle-criticism meetings one after another, combining the criticism of the "Seventy Articles on Industry" with the criticism of the small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the industrial and transportation system and the No. 1 capitalist-roader within the Party who supports them behind the scenes. Many units have formed a new wave of revolutionary criticism. The Shijingshan Power Plant was once used by the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique as a key unit for fully implementing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line. Recently, the revolutionary cadres of this plant have hoisted high the banner of revolutionary criticism, using great Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon and adopting the method of "people's war" to mobilize the broad masses of workers and cadres to launch a revolutionary criticism, achieving great results. The revolutionary workers of many factories and mines, such as Guanghua Timber Factory and Beijing Foreign Language Printing Plant, have said that criticizing the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party is a very important battle task for the revolutionary cadres at present. Chairman Mao has long said: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat. They will make their last struggle." We must firmly grasp the weapon of revolutionary criticism, never relax our vigilance for a moment, criticize the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party thoroughly, and swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

The broad masses of people's commune members in the suburbs of Beijing have launched a revolutionary criticism after the signal for a general offensive against the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party was sounded. At that time, they focused on criticizing the reactionary fallacies advocated by the No. 1 capitalist-roader within the Party, such as "exploitation is meritorious," "three independences and one contract," and material incentives. At present, the revolutionary criticism is entering a broader and deeper new stage in the suburbs. The broad masses of commune members of Ludaoqiao Brigade, Ludaoqiao Commune, have held dozens of meetings, big and small, to carry out revolutionary criticism.

Not long ago, some people thought that the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party had been beaten down, and the small group of capitalist-roaders within the Party in their own units had become "obedient" when they saw people, so they became soft-hearted, saying, "A hero does not hit a fallen man." In response to this idea, the revolutionary rebel factions organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's teaching: "The enemy will not disappear by itself. Whether it is the Chinese reactionaries or the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China, they will not voluntarily retire from the historical stage." At the same time, they presented a large amount of evidence, pointing out that the "fallen dogs" must be severely beaten. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Blue Flag Production Team, Dazhongsi Brigade, Haidian District, Dongcheng People's Commune said: The biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party are not dead tigers at all. If we do not smash them thoroughly, they will eat people. The set of capitalist poison they have spread, such as the fallacies of "three independences and one contract" and "exploitation is meritorious," has not been thoroughly exposed in the countryside. We must display the spirit of smashing the fallen dogs, criticize their various fallacies thoroughly, make them known to every household, and make them so despised that even rats crossing the street will be denounced by everyone.

The broad masses of cadres and soldiers of the leading organs of the Chinese People's Liberation Army and the troops stationed in Beijing have hoisted high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought and held several criticism meetings against China's Khrushchev and the small group of capitalist-roaders within the army. The broad masses of soldiers of the Red General Headquarters of the Navy Directly Affiliated Units said, Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism and revolution. Destruction must be reasoned, and reasoning is construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." The revolutionary criticism and struggle is a great destruction and construction, a great destruction of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line, and a great establishment of Mao Zedong Thought. Only through criticism can we purge the poison of counter-revolutionary revisionism spread by the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party and firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought.

The revolutionary cadres of the Central Directly Affiliated Arts System and the Chinese Academy of Sciences (Beijing Area) who have achieved revolutionary great unity have launched a fierce attack on the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party in the past one or two months. They have deeply felt from their own participation in the battle that to smash the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party politically, ideologically, and theoretically, the revolutionary cadres and all revolutionary organizations must hoist high the banner of revolutionary criticism and great unity, stop "fighting each other," and unite against the enemy. They have resolutely declared that they will hoist higher the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, further achieve great unity in the revolutionary criticism, form a mighty cultural revolutionary army, and smash the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party, leaving them no chance to escape!

    高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗　掀起革命大批判新高潮
    奋起千钧棒　痛打落水狗
    首都兴起空前规模的对党内最大的走资派的大揭发大批判大斗争高潮广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众决心彻底肃清反革命修正主义路线流毒，大立毛泽东思想绝对权威
    据新华社十七日讯　一个规模空前的对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大揭发、大批判、大斗争的高潮，正在无产阶级文化大革命的策源地、我们伟大领袖毛主席居住的地方——北京蓬勃兴起。战斗在革命大批判第一线的首都工农兵、红卫兵、革命师生和革命干部，牢记毛主席的“要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的伟大教导，发扬痛打“落水狗”的彻底革命精神，决心从政治上、思想上、理论上把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批深批透、斗倒斗臭，使这伙阶级敌人遗臭万年，永世不得翻身！
    首都广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，清醒地认识到，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是一批彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义分子，他们的反革命本性是不会改变的。这些家伙虽然已被广大的革命群众揪了出来，成了“落水狗”，但是，他们人还在，心不死，每时每刻都在伺机反扑，妄图东山再起，重新上台，进行反革命的阶级报复。如果让他们的反革命复辟阴谋得逞，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众就将人头落地，无产阶级文化大革命所取得的辉煌成果就将付诸东流，我们的社会主义祖国就将改变颜色。因此我们一定要牢记毛主席的教导：“决不怜惜蛇一样的恶人”，万万不可对那些“落水狗”所伪装起来的一副可怜相产生任何怜悯之心而手软起来。广大无产阶级革命派指出，能不能搞好革命的大批判，能不能把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派彻底斗倒批臭，是关系到把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底还是半途而废的重大问题，是关系到中国革命的前途和整个人类命运的重大问题。我们一定要高举革命的批判的大旗，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批深批透，斗倒斗臭，彻底肃清他们所推行的反革命修正主义路线在各个领域中的流毒，大树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    最近以来，首都工矿企业、农村人民公社、学校、机关和驻京部队，到处洋溢着革命大批判的强烈战斗气氛。无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众同仇敌忾，斗志昂扬，口诛笔伐，更广泛、更深入地开展对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动。他们纷纷举行斗批大会，张贴大字报、大标语，为报刊赶写批判文章。在批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的共同斗争目标下，越来越多的革命群众组织，已经停止“内战”，求大同，存小异，实现了革命的大联合。他们正在带着大批判中的问题，更进一步地活学活用毛主席著作，以光焰无际的毛泽东思想为指导，对这伙阶级敌人的言行和罪恶活动进行非常严肃认真的调查研究和深入的分析批判，并且正在逐步做到同本单位的斗批改相结合。他们的战斗口号是：“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”“发扬痛打‘落水狗’的彻底革命精神，彻底批倒批臭党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派！”
    革命的大批判，正在成为北京大学、清华大学、北京师范大学、北京地质学院等首都高等院校和已经复课闹革命的中等学校当前无产阶级文化大革命的一项中心任务。北京建筑工业学院“新八一”战斗团的战士，义愤填膺，怒火万丈，向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火。去年八月初，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派曾到这个学校进行所谓“蹲点”，明目张胆地同毛主席的无产阶级革命路线大唱反调，推行资产阶级反动路线。革命师生们早就对他恨之入骨。他们说，中国的赫鲁晓夫，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是一批反动透顶的豺狼，和一切反动派一样，“你不打，他就不倒”，决不会自动退出历史舞台。我们切切不可书生气十足，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派这些“落水狗”，不能有半点恻隐之心，而必须刀出鞘，弹上膛，穷追猛打，把他们批得臭臭的，不获全胜，决不收兵！首先在全校实行复课闹革命的北京航空学院的革命师生，把革命的大批判当作复课闹革命的中心任务，高举革命的批判大旗，掀起了写大字报、写批判文章的新高潮。他们拿起笔当刀枪，几天之间，就把北航校园变成了声讨党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大字报海洋。北航红旗战斗队的战士和革命师生们说，当前是不是积极投入这场大批判、大斗争运动，是辨别革命或不革命的试金石，是辨别革命派或“逍遥派”的试金石。每个红旗战士和革命师生都必须活学活用毛主席著作，自己动手、动脑，认真思考，以连续作战不怕疲劳的精神参加革命的大批判，在大批判、大斗争中尽到自己应尽的力量。
    首都工交战线的无产阶级革命派正在发动一个重要战役，就是对反革命修正主义的《工业七十条》进行深入的揭发和批判。从六月初开始，许多革命职工就纷纷举行座谈会、控诉会、批判会，运用大字报、墙报等各种形式，积极投入这场战斗。最近他们又接连召开斗批大会，把批判《工业七十条》同批判工交系统的一小撮反革命修正主义分子和在背后支持他们的党内头号走资本主义道路当权派进一步结合起来，许多单位已经形成了革命大批判的新高潮。石景山发电厂曾被彭真反革命修正主义集团当作全面推行反革命修正主义路线的重点单位。最近这个厂的无产阶级革命派，高举革命的批判大旗，以伟大的毛泽东思想为武器，采取打“人民战争”的方法，调动广大群众和干部展开革命大批判，已经取得了很大战绩。光华木材厂、北京外文印刷厂等不少工矿企业的革命职工都说，批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是当前无产阶级革命派的一项最重要的战斗任务。毛主席早就说过：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”我们一定要牢牢掌握革命大批判的武器，一时一刻也不松懈自己的警惕性，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
    北京郊区广大人民公社社员，在向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击的进军号吹响后，就开展了革命的大批判。当时，着重批判了党内头号走资本主义道路当权派鼓吹的“剥削有功”、“三自一包”、物质刺激等反动谬论。目前，革命的大批判正在郊区进入一个更广泛、更深入的新阶段。芦沟桥公社芦沟桥大队的广大社员，先后开了几十次大会、小会，开展革命的大批判。
    不久以前，有些人认为党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派被打得躺下了，本单位的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派一见人也“老实”了，于是有点手软，说：“好汉不打躺下的人。”针对这种思想，革命造反派组织大家学习毛主席的教导：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”同时，摆出了大量事实，指出必须狠打“落水狗”。海淀区东升人民公社大钟寺大队蓝旗生产队的贫下中农社员说：党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，绝不是什么死老虎，不把他们彻底打倒，它是会吃人的。他们所散布的一套资本主义的毒素，如“三自一包”、“剥削有功”的谬论，在农村中还没有彻底搞臭，我们必须发扬痛打“落水狗”的精神，把他们的种种谬论批臭，搞得家喻户晓，搞得老鼠过街，人人喊打才行。
    中国人民解放军领导机关和驻京部队的广大指战员高举毛泽东思想的革命批判大旗，连续多次举行了批判中国赫鲁晓夫和军队党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大会。海军直属机关红联总的广大战士说，伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”革命的大批判大斗争，就是大破大立，大破反革命修正主义路线，大立毛泽东思想。只有通过大批判，才能肃清党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派散布的反革命修正主义流毒，牢固地树立起毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    已经实现了革命大联合的中央直属文艺系统和中国科学院（京区）的无产阶级革命派，最近一两个月向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派连续发起了猛烈攻击。他们从自己参加实战的经历中深深体会到，要把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派从政治上、思想上、理论上斗倒批臭，无产阶级革命派和所有革命群众组织，必须高举革命的大批判、大联合的旗帜，停止“内战”，团结对敌。他们坚决表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，在革命的大批判中进一步搞好革命的大联合，组成一支浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派杀他个人仰马翻，片甲不留！
