On June 5, the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, Israel, launched a large-scale war of aggression against the Arab countries. This was a frenzied counterattack by U.S. neocolonialism, in collusion with Soviet revisionism, against the Arab people. A wealth of ironclad evidence proves that U.S. imperialism is the chief culprit behind this war of aggression, the most vicious enemy of the Arab people; the Soviet revisionist clique is a great traitor to the Arab people, the number one accomplice of the U.S. aggressors.

The U.S. imperialists plotted and directed Israel to launch the war of aggression. The Soviet revisionists restrained and deceived the Arab countries, tying their hands.

The U.S. imperialists launched this war of aggression after long-term planning and meticulous military preparations. This spring, at the behest of the U.S., the Israeli Prime Minister repeatedly and blatantly threatened, "We will use force against Syria." Simultaneously, Israeli troops continuously provoked border incidents. From March to May, the U.S. shipped over 400 new tanks and more than 200 aircraft to Israel, and also dispatched 1,000 "volunteers" from the U.S. Air Force to significantly enhance Israel's military offensive capabilities.

Facing the war threats from U.S. imperialism and Israel, the Arab countries rose up to counter the U.S.-Israeli aggression plot. In early May, Syria announced the cessation of activities by the U.S. spy organization "Friends of the Middle East" in Syria and, on May 15, publicly exposed the U.S.-Israeli plot to launch a military attack on Syria. On May 18, the United Arab Republic demanded the withdrawal of the "United Nations Emergency Force" from the Gaza Strip and the UAR territory, and on May 22, announced the blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba.

At this time, the U.S. imperialists directed Israel to accelerate the launch of the war of aggression. On May 25, Israeli Foreign Minister Eban hurriedly arrived in Washington for secret talks with Johnson, Rusk, and others. According to Reuters, "Eban received a guarantee of U.S. action, not a vague promise of support." After Eban returned, Israel quickly completed "general mobilization" and concentrated troops on the borders of the UAR and Syria. On June 1, the Israeli "War Cabinet" was formed, with the fascist Dyan, who had served as the commander-in-chief of the Israeli military during the 1956 Anglo-French-Israeli invasion of Egypt, taking over as Minister of Defense. At the same time, the U.S. Sixth Fleet and the British Navy moved towards the eastern Mediterranean and the Red Sea, the U.S. and Britain urgently airlifted military equipment and ammunition to Israel, U.S. U-2 spy planes were ordered to conduct reconnaissance, and preparations were made for Israel's sudden attack.

According to the U.S. "Newsweek" report, after all the war preparations were in place, Chairman Wheeler of the U.S. Joint Chiefs of Staff reported to Johnson, once again guaranteeing that if Israel successfully completed the initial air attack, Israel would win the war in three to four days. Wheeler's opinion was supported by the Director of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency, Helms.

On June 2 and 3, British Prime Minister Wilson rushed to the U.S. for the final war planning with Johnson. On June 3, the Israeli Ambassador to the U.S. returned to his country with a secret letter from Johnson and participated in the emergency cabinet meeting.

The situation was clear: Israel's attack was imminent. The Soviet revisionist clique knew this fact, but it deceived the Arab countries, saying that Israel would not attack, urging the Arab countries to "restrain themselves," "be cautious," and "avoid a major confrontation," obstructing them from taking effective self-defense measures and tying their hands. On one hand, the Soviet revisionist clique hypocritically claimed that it would not "stand idly by" when the Arab countries were invaded; on the other hand, it colluded closely with the U.S., revealing its bottom line to the U.S., and promising that it would absolutely not obstruct the U.S. aggression.

During this period, Moscow and Washington, London, and Paris exchanged frequent telegrams, and special envoys came and went, engaging in secret diplomatic activities. According to Western newspapers and news agencies, Johnson had written to Kosygin about the Middle East situation, requesting "joint diplomatic action." The Soviet revisionist clique assured the U.S. that the U.S. and the Soviet Union had "definite interests" in the Middle East. It was revealed that two weeks before the war broke out, Johnson had had an "urgent and secret" contact with Kosygin, and later continued to "maintain contact," "through urgent exchanges of views, Washington and Moscow exchanged signals, indicating their common desire to avoid a U.S.-Soviet confrontation in the Middle East."

On May 23, Johnson issued a statement, threatening the Arab countries. On the same day, the Soviet government also issued a statement, neither supporting the UAR's demand for the withdrawal of the "United Nations Emergency Force" and the blockade of the Gulf of Aqaba, nor condemning the U.S. aggression plot, but instead saying insidiously that "the peace and security of the Near East must not be disrupted." The Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialists echoed each other, jointly exerting pressure on the Arab countries.

On May 24, British Foreign Secretary Brown rushed to Moscow for an emergency meeting with Kosygin. According to the British "Daily Mirror," Brown returned with "a secret assurance of Russian assistance in defusing the Middle East crisis." According to the French "Paris Radical," Brown also said, "Soviet diplomacy has actively urged Arab leaders to calm down behind the scenes," "In public, they support the Arab countries, but in private, they expound on the dangers of armed intervention in Israel (which should be read as countering Israel's aggression)."

On May 26, Johnson sent a telegram to UAR President Nasser, threatening that the UAR must "stop any military actions that could lead to a large-scale war offensive." The next morning, Kosygin also urgently met with Nasser through the Soviet Ambassador to the UAR, insisting that the Soviet government demanded that the UAR "not fire the first shot." According to UAR newspapers, Kosygin did this at the behest of the U.S.

At the end of May, the Soviet revisionist clique dispatched more than a dozen warships through the Bosphorus Strait into the eastern Mediterranean. A Soviet warship even sailed in formation with a U.S. warship, with personnel on both sides waving and taking photos. On June 1, U.S. Vice President Humphrey publicly praised, "The activity of Soviet ships in the Mediterranean is normal." It is clear that the Soviet revisionist clique's deployment of a few warships was not to support the Arab countries.

The above facts fully prove that the war of aggression launched by Israel was manufactured by U.S. imperialism and was a conspiracy of British imperialism. The Soviet revisionists colluded with the U.S. and Britain, indulging Israel's aggression. The political deception played by the Soviet revisionists on the Arab countries provided cover for the sudden attack by the U.S. and Israel, making the Arab countries fall into a big trap.

The U.S. and British imperialists directly participated in the war of aggression. The Soviet revisionists openly engaged in the treacherous act of selling out the Arab people.

On June 5, U.S. imperialism unleashed Israel. The Israeli Air Force launched a large-scale attack on the airfields of the UAR, Syria, and other countries. The Israeli ground forces invaded the territories of the Arab countries in large numbers.

During the six days of Israel's armed aggression, U.S. imperialism took the field, directly participating in the war of aggression. According to the official disclosure by the UAR: The aircraft carriers of the U.S. Sixth Fleet were ordered to protect Israeli airspace and provide air cover for Israel. Aircraft from the U.S. aircraft carriers bombed UAR air bases on the first day of the aggression. Jordan's radar network also detected batches of U.S. aircraft taking off from its aircraft carriers in the Mediterranean. Jordan shot down a U.S. fighter on the first day of the war. In addition, the ships of the U.S. Sixth Fleet also sailed near the UAR coast, interfering with the UAR radar network and intercepting UAR military telegrams.

British imperialism also directly participated in the war. The UAR Armed Forces High Command exposed that Canberra-style bombers marked with British insignia had participated in the attack on UAR positions in the Sinai Peninsula.

After the U.S. and Israel launched a sudden attack on the Arab countries, the Soviet revisionist clique colluded even more shamelessly with the U.S., selling out the Arab people. Five hours after the war broke out, Kosygin used the "hotline" to tell Johnson, "The Soviet Union does not want a war with the U.S. in the Middle East." According to U.S. newspapers, when the "hotline" teletype machine in the White House basement began to urgently report and transmitted a Russian telegram signed by "A. Kosygin," Johnson rushed from his bedroom to the "situation room" and had the translator quickly translate the telegram. He further confirmed from Kosygin's telegram that the Soviet revisionists would not take any steps to obstruct U.S. actions, and thus went all out.

To meet the needs of the U.S., the Soviet revisionist clique issued a statement on June 5, not condemning U.S. imperialism at all, avoiding the issue of assisting the Arab people's anti-aggression struggle, and vigorously advocating for "other governments, including major powers," to "extinguish the flames of the Near East," and also demanding that the United Nations "take immediate measures necessary to restore peace in the Near East." This was an attempt to use the United Nations to promote "great power politics" and extinguish the flames of the Arab people's anti-aggression struggle.

The Soviet revisionist clique openly tore off its so-called "support" for the Arab countries' "anti-aggression" facade, betraying its trust and standing idly by when the Arab countries were invaded, refusing to provide assistance. It never dared to touch a hair of U.S. imperialism. Even regarding the facts exposed by the UAR of the U.S. and Britain's direct participation in the war, the Soviet revisionist newspapers did not report a single word. When the UAR Ambassador was instructed to urgently inform Kosygin of the matter, Kosygin still expressed disbelief and even quoted the "intelligence" of the Soviet revisionists to defend the U.S. and British imperialists. Not only that, when Arab students in the Soviet Union held anti-aggression demonstrations in Moscow, the Soviet revisionist clique sent out 5,000 military police, using more than 160 trucks, forming five lines of defense to protect the U.S. and British embassies.

On June 6, Kosygin again used the "hotline" to tell Johnson that the Soviet revisionists accepted the U.S.-proposed "unconditional ceasefire." Following this, the Soviet revisionist representative, together with the U.S. and Britain, fabricated a resolution in the Security Council to force the Arab countries to "immediately cease fire." On June 7, the Soviet revisionist representative added fuel to the fire, proposing a "limited ceasefire" resolution. These resolutions and decisions were all aimed at stopping the Arab people's anti-aggression struggle, openly protecting Israel, which had already occupied large tracts of Arab land, and under their cover, Israel continued its attacks. On June 8, the UAR representative to the United Nations, instructed by the UAR government, refused the "unconditional ceasefire," but the Soviet revisionist clique, through its Ambassador to the UAR, exerted pressure to change the decision. Under the pressure of the U.S.-Soviet collusion in promoting "great power politics," Jordan, the UAR, and Syria were forced to agree to the "ceasefire" one after another.

To cover up its traitorous face of selling out the Arab people, the Soviet revisionist clique, on June 7, pretended to send a note to Israel, threatening to "reconsider" its relations with Israel, etc. However, on the day after the note was sent, that is, the day after the "limited ceasefire" resolution was passed, a Soviet cargo ship was the first to enter the Gulf of Aqaba, which had just been controlled by Israel. Israeli torpedo boats also "saluted" the Soviet ship, and anyone with eyes could see the farce they were playing. The Soviet revisionists' action was actually to acknowledge Israel's occupation of the Gulf of Aqaba and to take the lead in acknowledging the U.S., Britain, and Israel's plot to turn the Gulf of Aqaba into an international waterway.

The U.S. imperialists were overjoyed and highly satisfied with the Soviet revisionist clique's series of treacherous acts. The Democratic leader of the U.S. Senate, Mansfield, openly stated that the U.S. and the Soviet Union had conducted close "joint efforts" and "cooperation" in the Middle East incident. The U.S. "Newsweek" wrote: When the Israelis attacked the Arab armies, Johnson "concentrated on keeping the Russians from getting involved," "which had produced a remarkably satisfactory effect." The U.S. big bosses' public praise of the Soviet revisionist clique made the faces of these traitors even more exposed.

After the Arab countries were forced to cease fire, Israel's arrogance soared, even openly proposing to expand its territory. U.S. imperialism also took advantage of the situation, proposing the so-called "five principles" to solve the Middle East problem. These "principles" were essentially to ensure the permanent legal existence of the Israeli Zionist regime and satisfy its expansionist ambitions; to let the so-called "United Nations Emergency Force" return to the Arab region to intensify the suppression of the national liberation movement there and expand the scope of U.S. neocolonialism in the Middle East.

To cover up its traitorous face and extricate itself from its embarrassing situation, the Soviet revisionist clique hastily played some new tricks. It rallied a small group of followers and the Tito clique to issue a joint statement of seven countries on June 9, and on June 21, it passed a so-called resolution of the CPSU Central Committee on Middle East policy. It solemnly declared a break in relations with Israel and proposed to convene an emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly. However, these tricks were soon exposed by the Soviet revisionist clique itself.

On June 19, one hour after Johnson delivered his speech, Kosygin followed suit with a speech at the United Nations General Assembly. He and Johnson sang in unison, advocating that the great powers should "find a common language" on the Middle East issue, "clear the way for the restoration of peace in the Near East," and "not allow the emergence of a source of war," frenziedly opposing the anti-imperialist struggle of the Arab people and serving the U.S.'s new aggression plan.

Kosygin's visit to the U.S. was originally to seek an audience with Johnson. He held two lengthy secret talks with Johnson, totaling ten hours. The two were in perfect harmony, like family. Kosygin even could not help but say, "Coming to Glassboro is like coming home." This was a full exposure of the traitor's psychology.

This Soviet-U.S. meeting not only conducted a greater deal on the Middle East issue but also coordinated and cooperated on a global strategic level, jointly plotting new conspiracies to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world, and reached new agreements and tacit understandings on many major current international issues. This meeting marked the entry of the U.S.-Soviet collusion into a new stage, with the Soviet revisionists completely bowing down to U.S. imperialism and playing the role of a supporting actor and servant in the counter-revolutionary alliance led by the U.S.

After this meeting, the U.S. and the Soviet Union engaged in even closer collusion in the United Nations. Through the behind-the-scenes activities of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, on July 10, the Security Council decided to send "United Nations observers" to the Suez Canal area to supervise the "ceasefire," thus allowing the U.S.-controlled United Nations personnel, who had been expelled not long ago, to return to the UAR territory.

The people of the Arab countries have seen clearly. They condemn U.S. aggression and denounce the Soviet revisionists' betrayal.

War tests various political forces and greatly raises the awareness of the masses. Many things that are difficult to recognize in peacetime over many years can be seen clearly in just a few days during the war.

Through the Middle East incident, the Arab people further recognized who their true enemies were and who their true friends were.

During the entire period of this incident, the broad masses of the Arab countries, with the strong support of the peoples of the world, launched a massive demonstration storm, angrily condemning the heinous crimes of the U.S., Britain, and Israel, and unanimously denouncing the treacherous acts of the Soviet revisionists. The masses of the UAR, Syria, Yemen, Sudan, and other countries smashed the U.S. embassies. The broad masses of many Arab countries gathered in front of the Soviet revisionist embassies to demonstrate. "Down with Johnson!" "Down with Kosygin!" The roar echoed across the vast Arab region. Some Arab friends said: "At the critical moment when the Arab people were invaded by the U.S. and Israel, the Soviet Union not only did not support us but also stabbed us in the back. The Soviet Union is truly despicable." Another friend said: "Today we clearly see that U.S. imperialism and Israel are our mortal enemies. The Soviet Union is our false friend and true traitor."

Through the anti-aggression struggle, the Arab people more clearly recognized that the Chinese people are their most loyal and reliable friends. Some Arab friends said: "At the critical moment, China firmly stood on our side. China is our true friend." The Arab people, in their denunciation of "Soviet revisionists as traitors," when passing by the Chinese Embassy, always enthusiastically shouted: "Long live Mao Zedong!" "Long live the Chinese people!" Many Arab people unanimously said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding light for the Arab people."

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The tide of the people of the world opposing the U.S. aggressors is irresistible. The struggle of the people of the world against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys will certainly achieve even greater victories." The increasingly awakened Arab people will certainly draw lessons from this war, strengthen their unity, persist in their struggle, drive out all the new colonialists led by the U.S., and eliminate all the invaders and aggressors!

    看，美帝苏修在中东事件中怎样进行反革命大勾结
    新华社十五日讯　本社记者述评：六月五日，美帝国主义及其走狗以色列向阿拉伯国家发动了一场大规模的侵略战争。这是美国新殖民主义，在苏联修正主义的配合下，对阿拉伯人民进行的一次疯狂的反扑。大量的铁的事实证明：美帝国主义是这场侵略战争的罪魁祸首，是阿拉伯人民最凶恶的敌人；苏修集团是出卖阿拉伯人民的大叛徒，是美国侵略者的头号帮凶。
    美帝策划指使以色列发动侵略战争
    苏修又压又骗束缚阿拉伯国家手脚
    美帝国主义发动这场侵略战争，是蓄谋已久的，并在军事上作了周密的部署。今年春天以来，在美帝授意下，以色列总理一再公开露骨地叫嚷，“要对叙利亚使用武力”。同时，以色列军队不断挑起边境事件。三月到五月间，美国给以色列运去了四百来辆新坦克和二百多架飞机，而且从美国空军部队中调去一千名“志愿人员”，大大加强了以色列的军事进攻力量。
    面对美帝国主义和以色列的战争威胁，阿拉伯国家起来反击美以侵略阴谋。叙利亚在五月初宣布停止美国间谍机构“中东之友协会”在叙利亚的活动，并在五月十五日公开揭露美以武装进攻叙利亚的企图。阿联在五月十八日要求“联合国紧急部队”撤离加沙地区和阿联领土，并在五月二十二日宣布封锁亚喀巴湾。
    这时，美帝国主义指使以色列加快了发动侵略战争的步子。五月二十五日，以色列外长埃班匆匆到达华盛顿，同约翰逊、腊斯克等秘密会谈。据路透社透露：“埃班得到了美国采取行动的保证，而不是含糊的支持的保证。”在埃班回国后，以色列迅速完成了“总动员”，并在阿联和叙利亚边境集结部队。六月一日，以色列“战争内阁”组成，曾经在一九五六年英法以侵略埃及的战争中担任以军总司令的法西斯分子达扬出任国防部长。与此同时，美国第六舰队和英国海军向东地中海和红海地区调动，美英向以色列紧急空运军事装备和弹药，美国的Ｕ—2间谍飞机奉命进行侦察，为以色列发动突然袭击做了准备。
    据美国《新闻周刊》报道，战争布置一切就绪，美国参谋长联席会议主席惠勒就向约翰逊提出报告，再次保证，如果以色列圆满地完成初步的空中进攻，以色列将在三、四天内赢得战争。惠勒的意见得到美国中央情报局局长赫尔姆斯的支持。
    六月二日和三日，英国首相威尔逊赶到美国，同约翰逊进行了最后的战争策划。六月三日，以色列驻美大使带着约翰逊的密信回国，参加紧急内阁会议。
    情况非常清楚，以色列发动进攻已是箭在弦上。苏修集团明明知道这个事实，但是，它却欺哄阿拉伯国家，说以色列不会进攻，要阿拉伯国家“克制”，“谨慎”，“避免一场大的较量”，阻挠它们采取有效的自卫措施，束缚了它们的手脚。苏修集团一方面假惺惺地表示，在阿拉伯国家遭受侵略时，它“不会袖手旁观”；另一方面，它却同美帝加紧勾结，向美帝交底，表示它绝对不会妨碍美帝侵略。
    在此期间，莫斯科同华盛顿、伦敦、巴黎函电往返频繁，特使络绎不绝，大搞秘密外交活动。据西方报刊和通讯社报道，约翰逊曾就中东局势致函柯西金要求采取“联合外交行动”，苏修集团则向美国保证，苏美两国在中东“有肯定的利害关系”。据透露，在战争爆发前两星期，约翰逊就同柯西金进行了“紧急而又秘密的接触”，以后又继续“保持着联系”，“通过紧急地交换意见，华盛顿和莫斯科互相打了招呼，表明它们有着避免美苏在中东发生冲突的共同愿望”。
    五月二十三日，约翰逊发表声明，对阿拉伯国家进行恫吓威胁。同一天，苏联政府也发表声明，既不支持阿联要求“联合国紧急部队”撤退和封锁亚喀巴湾的正义行动，更不谴责美帝的侵略阴谋，而是别有用心地说什么“不允许破坏近东的和平与安全”。苏修美帝互相呼应，共同对阿拉伯国家施加压力。
    五月二十四日，英国外交大臣布朗赶到莫斯科，同柯西金紧急会谈。据英国《每日镜报》报道，布朗带回了“俄国协助平息中东危机的秘密保证”。据法国《巴黎激进报》透露，布朗还说，“苏联外交在幕后积极地促使阿拉伯领导人平静下来，”“在公开场合，他们支持阿拉伯国家，而在私下，他们则阐述武装干涉以色列（应读作反击以色列的侵略）的一切危险。”
    五月二十六日，约翰逊打电报给阿联总统纳赛尔，威胁阿联必须“停止采取任何可能导致大规模战争攻势的军事行动”。第二天凌晨，柯西金也通过苏联驻阿联大使紧急会见纳赛尔，表示苏联政府坚持要求阿联“不要首先开火”。据阿联报纸报道，柯西金是按照美国的主意这样做的。
    五月底，苏修集团派了十几艘军舰通过博斯普鲁斯海峡进入东地中海。一艘苏联军舰竟然同美国军舰排列航行，双方人员互相挥手并拍照。六月一日，美国副总统汉弗莱公开赞扬说，“苏联舰只在地中海活动是正常的。”可见苏修集团摆出几条军舰，根本不是去支持阿拉伯国家的。
    以上事实充分说明，以色列发动的这场侵略战争，是美帝国主义一手制造的，是英帝国主义参加合谋的。苏修同美、英串通一气，纵容了以色列的侵略。苏修向阿拉伯国家玩弄的政治欺骗，对美以的突然进攻起了掩护作用，使阿拉伯国家上了大当。
    美英帝国主义直接参与侵略战争
    苏修大搞出卖阿拉伯人民的勾当
    六月五日，美帝国主义放以色列出笼。以色列空军大批出动，轰炸了阿联、叙利亚等国的机场。以色列的地面部队大举侵入阿拉伯国家的领土。
    在以色列发动武装侵略的六天中，美帝国主义赤膊上阵，直接参与侵略战争。据阿联官方揭露：美国第六舰队的航空母舰，奉命保护以色列领空，给以色列提供空中掩护。美国航空母舰的飞机，在侵略战争的第一天就轰炸了阿联的空军基地。约旦的雷达网也侦察到一批一批的美国飞机从它在地中海的航空母舰上起飞。约旦在战争的第一天就击落过一架美国战斗机。此外，美国第六舰队的舰只还开到阿联海面附近，进行干扰阿联雷达网截收阿联军事电报的勾当。
    英帝国主义也直接参战。阿联武装部队最高司令部揭露，涂着英国标记的堪培拉式轰炸机曾参加袭击阿联在西奈半岛的阵地。
    美以对阿拉伯国家发动突然进攻以后，苏修集团更加无耻地同美帝勾结，出卖阿拉伯人民。战争爆发后五小时，柯西金就通过“热线”向约翰逊表白，“苏联不希望同美国在中东发生战争”。据美国报刊透露，当设在白宫地下室的“热线”电传机开始紧急通报、传来了由“阿·柯西金”签署的一份俄文电报时，约翰逊连忙从寝室冲到“情况室”，并让翻译赶快把电报译出来。他从柯西金的来电中进一步肯定苏修不会采取什么步骤来妨碍美国的行动，于是就放手大干了。
    为了迎合美帝的需要，苏修集团在六月五日发表声明，绝口不谴责美帝国主义，避而不谈援助阿拉伯人民反侵略斗争问题，拚命鼓吹“包括大国在内的其它国家政府”来“熄灭近东的战火”，并且还叫嚷什么要联合国“火速采取恢复近东和平所必要的措施”。这也就是企图利用联合国，推行“大国强权政治”，扑灭阿拉伯人民的反侵略斗争烈火。
    苏修集团公开撕掉了它的所谓“支持”阿拉伯国家“反对侵略”的伪装，当阿拉伯国家遭受侵略时背信弃义，袖手旁观，拒绝给予援助。它始终不敢碰美帝国主义一根毫毛。甚至对于阿联揭露的美英直接参战的事实，苏修报纸也一个字都不报道。在阿联驻苏大使奉命将此事紧急通知柯西金时，柯西金还表示不相信此事，他甚至当面引用苏修的“情报”，为美英帝国主义辩护。不仅如此，当阿拉伯各国留苏学生在莫斯科举行反侵略示威时，苏修集团竟然派出五千名军警，使用一百六十多辆卡车，组成五道防线，为美英使馆保驾。
    六月六日，柯西金又通过“热线”，告诉约翰逊说，苏修接受美国提出的“无条件停火”。接着，苏修代表便在安全理事会上伙同美英炮制出一个逼迫阿拉伯国家“立即停火”的决议。六月七日，苏修代表又加了一把劲儿，提出一个“限期停火”的提案。这些提案和决议都是要阿拉伯人民停止反侵略斗争，公然袒护已经侵占了阿拉伯大片领土的以色列，而且以色列在它们的掩护下，还在继续进攻。六月八日，阿联驻联合国代表奉阿联政府指示，拒绝“无条件停火”，但是苏修集团却通过其驻阿联大使施加压力，要阿联改变决定。在美苏勾结大搞“强权政治”的压力下，约旦、阿联和叙利亚相继被迫同意“停火”。
    苏修集团为了掩盖它出卖阿拉伯人民的叛徒面目，在六月七日，装模作样地向以色列发出一个照会，扬言它将“重新考虑”同以色列的关系等等。但是，就在照会发出的第二天，也就是“限期停火”的决议通过后的第二天，苏修的一艘货船迫不及待地第一个驶入刚刚被以色列控制的亚喀巴湾。以色列鱼雷艇还向苏船“致敬”，明眼人一看就知道双方上演的什么丑剧。苏修的这个行动，实际上是带头承认以色列对亚喀巴湾的侵占，并为美、英、以力图把亚喀巴湾变为国际水道的阴谋打先锋。
    美帝国主义对于苏修集团的这一系列叛卖活动，喜形于色，深表满意。美国参议院民主党头子曼斯菲尔德公开表示，美苏在中东事件中进行了密切的“共同努力”和“合作”。美国《新闻周刊》写道：以色列人攻击阿拉伯军队时，约翰逊“集中力量使俄国人不卷入”，“已经产生显著圆满的效果”。美国大老板对苏修集团这样当众表扬，使得这一伙叛徒的面目更加暴露无遗。
    美帝得寸进尺妄图推行新的侵略计划
    苏修重新装扮自己公开投入美帝怀抱
    在阿拉伯国家被迫停火以后，以色列气焰嚣张，甚至公然提出扩张领土的野心。美帝国主义也得寸进尺，抛出了所谓解决中东问题的“五项原则”。这些“原则”实质上就是要确保以色列犹太复国主义政权的永久合法存在，并满足它的扩张野心；让所谓“联合国紧急部队”重返阿拉伯地区，加紧镇压那里的民族解放运动，扩大美国新殖民主义在中东的势力范围。
    苏修集团为了掩盖它的叛徒嘴脸，摆脱狼狈不堪的困境，匆匆忙忙地玩了一些新的花招。它纠集一小撮追随者和铁托集团，于六月九日发表了一个七国联合声明，二十一日还通过了一个所谓苏共中央关于中东政策的“决议”。它煞有介事地宣布同以色列断交，并且建议召开什么联合国大会紧急会议。但是这些西洋景没有几天就被苏修集团自己拆穿了。
    六月十九日，在约翰逊发表演说的一小时后，柯西金紧跟着在联合国大会上发表讲话。他同约翰逊一唱一和，鼓吹大国在中东问题上要“找到共同语言”，“扫清恢复近东和平的道路”，“不容许出现战争策源地”，疯狂反对阿拉伯人民的反帝斗争，为美帝推行新的侵略计划效劳。
    柯西金这次到美国去，本来就是为了求见约翰逊的。他同约翰逊前后两次举行了长达十小时的密谈。两人情投意合，亲如家人。柯西金甚至情不自禁地说，来到葛拉斯堡罗“就象回家一样”。这是叛徒心理的充分暴露。
    这次苏美会谈，不仅在中东问题上进行了更大的交易，而且在全球战略上进行了全面的协调和配合，共同策划了镇压世界各国人民革命斗争的新阴谋，就当前许多重大国际问题达成了新的协议和默契。这次会谈，标志着美苏勾结进入了一个新的阶段，苏修完全拜倒在美帝的脚下，在以美帝为首的反革命同盟中充当配角和奴仆。
    这次会谈后，美苏在联合国进行了更加紧密的勾结。经过美苏幕后活动，七月十日安理会决定派遣“联合国观察员”进驻苏伊士运河区，监督“停火”，从而使前不久被赶走的受美国控制的联合国人员又重返阿联领土。
    阿拉伯各国人民擦亮了眼睛
    声讨美帝侵略怒斥苏修叛卖
    战争检验了各种政治力量，极大地提高了人民群众的觉悟。有许多事情在平时多少年也不容易认识到，而在战争时期，短短几天内，就可以看得很清楚。
    通过中东事件，阿拉伯人民进一步认清了谁是他们真正的敌人，谁是他们真正的朋友。
    在这次事件的整个期间，阿拉伯各国的广大群众在世界各国人民强大的声援下，掀起了声势浩大示威风暴，愤怒声讨美英以的滔天罪行，同声怒斥苏修的叛卖行径。阿联、叙利亚、也门、苏丹等国群众砸了美国使馆。许多阿拉伯国家的广大群众涌向苏修使馆前面示威。“打倒约翰逊！”“打倒柯西金！”的怒吼声响彻广阔的阿拉伯地区的上空。有的阿拉伯朋友说：“正当阿拉伯人民遭到美以侵略的关键时刻，苏联不但不支持我们，反而从我们的背后给我们一刀。苏联真是可恶。”还有朋友说：“今天我们清楚地看到，美帝国主义和以色列是我们的死敌。苏联是我们的假朋友、真叛徒。”
    阿拉伯人民通过反侵略斗争，更清楚地认识到中国人民是他们最忠实可靠的朋友。有的阿拉伯朋友说：“在紧要时刻，中国坚定地站在我们一边，中国是我们的真正的朋友。”阿拉伯人民在痛斥“苏修是叛徒”的示威中，当走过中国大使馆时，总是热情高呼：“毛泽东万岁！”“中国人民万岁！”许多阿拉伯人民异口同声地说：“毛泽东思想是阿拉伯人民的指路明灯。”
    毛主席教导我们：“全世界人民反对美国侵略者的怒潮是不可阻挡的。全世界人民反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争一定会取得更加伟大的胜利。”日益觉醒的阿拉伯人民一定会从这场战争中总结经验，吸取教训，加强团结，坚持斗争，把以美帝为首的新殖民主义统统赶走，把一切侵略强盗统统消灭干净！
