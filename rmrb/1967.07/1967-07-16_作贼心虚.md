Recently, the Soviet revisionist leader Brezhnev boasted in a speech to Soviet military academy graduates that the Soviet revisionist clique's actions "at the critical moment of the Near East crisis" were "correct." He specifically mentioned that Kosygin had "convincingly pointed out and exposed the aggressive actions of Israel and its supporters" at the emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly. However, Brezhnev completely avoided mentioning Kosygin's secret talks with the head of American imperialism, Johnson, in Glassboro.

According to Kosygin himself, the talks in Glassboro were a meeting between the leaders of "two superpowers," and they exchanged views on "a series of international issues." Since this is the case, in the eyes of the Soviet revisionists, this is certainly not a trivial matter. People remember that eight years ago, when Khrushchev met Eisenhower at Camp David, the Soviet revisionist clique spared no effort in widely publicizing the event! But look at how the Soviet revisionist clique handled Kosygin's meeting with Johnson this time!

Kosygin's first meeting with Johnson was only reported by Tass with a 37-character news item, and *Pravda* published this news with a very small headline in a very inconspicuous position on the first page. This strange phenomenon prompted the British *Times* to photograph *Pravda*'s front page and publish it as a unique piece of sensational news.

Kosygin's second meeting with Johnson was also only briefly reported by Moscow Radio and Tass, emphasizing that the meeting was held "at Johnson's request" and that there were "deep-seated differences" between the two sides.

Even more interestingly, when Kosygin returned to Moscow, Tass's news mentioned that Kosygin had met with some foreign leaders during his trip, but the list omitted U.S. President Johnson.

In short, the Soviet revisionist clique tried to avoid and cover up Kosygin's secret talks with Johnson. Why did they hide this from the Soviet people?

The matter is clear: The Soviet revisionist traitors have a guilty conscience.

When the Vietnamese people were fighting a bloody battle against the American aggressors, when the Arab people suffered armed aggression from American imperialism and its lackeys and their land was lost, when people all over the world were condemning American imperialism as the most vicious enemy, Kosygin traveled thousands of miles to the other side of the ocean to fraternize with the head of American imperialism. This shameful act, how could the Soviet revisionist clique explain it to the Soviet people? Would they dare to tell the Soviet people about Kosygin's disgusting behavior in Hollybush, where he warmly shook hands with Johnson, laughed and joked, walked arm in arm, and took "family photos"? Not to mention the unspeakable deeds he did during the two days of secret talks.

The Kosygin gang not only betrayed the Arab people, the Vietnamese people, and the people of all countries in the world, but also betrayed the Soviet people. The Soviet revisionist clique deeply knows that their actions are unacceptable to the broad masses of the Soviet people. For this reason, they have resorted to every means to block information, distort facts, and deceive the Soviet people. Even if they make fools of themselves, expose their weaknesses, speak incoherently, and create contradictions, they do not care.

However, the truth cannot be hidden forever. No matter how the Soviet revisionist clique plays tricks, they cannot hide their traitorous faces from the Soviet people. Since they are against the people, they will inevitably face the punishment of the Soviet people.

    作贼心虚
    杨豪
    苏修头目勃列日涅夫最近在对苏联军事学院毕业生讲话时，大言不惭地吹嘘苏修集团“在近东危机的紧要时刻”的行动“是正确的”，并且特别提到柯西金在联合国大会紧急会议上“令人信服地指出和揭露了以色列及其支持者的侵略作用”。但是，勃列日涅夫却完全避而不谈柯西金同以色列侵略的指使者美帝国主义头子约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗的密谈。
    柯西金同约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗的密谈，用柯西金自己的话来说，是“两个超大国”首脑的会晤，而且是“就一系列国际问题交换了意见”。既然这样，在苏修眼里，这总不是一件微不足道的小事情。人们记得，八年前赫鲁晓夫同艾森豪威尔在戴维营会谈的时候，苏修集团是怎样不遗余力地大事宣扬呀！但是，请看苏修集团是怎样对待这一次柯西金同约翰逊的会谈的呢？
    柯西金同约翰逊第一次会谈，塔斯社只发了一条三十七个俄文字的新闻，而《真理报》把这条新闻用很小的标题，刊登在第一版的很不显著的地位。这种怪现象，使得英国《泰晤士报》特地把《真理报》的这个版面拍成照片登了出来，成了一条别开生面的花边新闻。
    柯西金同约翰逊的第二次会谈，莫斯科电台和塔斯社也是只作了简单的报道，并且强调会谈是“应约翰逊的要求”举行的，双方的立场存在着“深刻分歧”。
    特别有趣的是，当柯西金回到莫斯科的时候，塔斯社的新闻谈到柯西金在这次旅行中曾经会见过一些外国的领导人，名单中独独漏掉了美国总统约翰逊。
    总之，苏修集团对于柯西金同约翰逊的密谈，能回避者回避，能掩饰者掩饰。他们为什么要对苏联人民这样讳莫如深呢？
    事情是很清楚的：苏修叛徒们作贼心虚。
    当越南人民正在同美国侵略者进行浴血战斗的时候，当阿拉伯人民遭受了美帝国主义及其走狗的武装侵略而国土沦丧的时候，当全世界人民都在谴责美帝国主义是最凶恶的敌人的时候，柯西金却不远千里地跑到大洋彼岸去同美帝国主义的头子吊膀子。这种见不得人的丑事，苏修集团怎么能够向苏联人民作出交代呢？他们敢把柯西金在霍利布什同约翰逊热烈握手、谈笑风生、挽臂而行、拍“合家欢”等等肉麻的丑态告诉苏联人民吗？就更不用说他在两天密谈之中所干下的那些不可告人的勾当了。
    柯西金一伙不仅背叛了阿拉伯人民，背叛了越南人民，背叛了世界各国人民，同时也背叛了苏联人民。苏修集团深深知道，他们的所作所为，是苏联广大人民所不会答应的。正是因为这样，他们不得不千方百计封锁消息，歪曲事实，对苏联人民进行蒙蔽和欺骗，即使出洋相，露马脚，语无伦次，矛盾百出，也顾不得那么许多了。
    但是，纸是包不住火的。苏修集团无论怎样玩弄花招，都无法在苏联人民面前掩藏他们的叛徒面目。他们既然反人民，就终归逃脱不了被苏联人民惩罚的命运。
