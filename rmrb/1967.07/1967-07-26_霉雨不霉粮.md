Title: No Moldy Grain Despite Rainy Season

The wheat harvest in the third brigade of Daxing Commune in Sheyang County, Jiangsu Province, has achieved an unprecedented bumper harvest this year. Recently, with the arrival of the rainy season, the revolutionary masses and cadres of the brigade have once again timely studied Chairman Mao's teaching: "Every year, we must firmly grasp the three tasks of harvesting, storing, and using grain." They checked the condition of the wheat and found that most of it was very dry. Upon closer inspection, they discovered that the wheat at the bottom of two storage pits had gotten damp, and about thirty jin had gone moldy.

This inspection corrected the complacency of some people. The more bountiful the harvest, the more we must economize; the more it rains, the more vigilant we must be, and we must not allow the wheat to go moldy. Recently, the third brigade of Daxing Commune has taken advantage of clear days to sun-dry over 30,000 jin of wheat.

Editor's Note:

Chairman Mao teaches us, "Every year, we must firmly grasp the three tasks of harvesting, storing, and using grain."

Now that the summer grain in most regions has been brought into the granaries, we must firmly grasp the task of storage. If we are even slightly negligent, we may cause unnecessary losses to the grain we have already harvested.

This year, some regions have experienced more rain, which has brought some difficulties to the grain storage work. However, as long as we learn from the third brigade of Daxing Commune and pay close attention to storage, taking advantage of clear days to frequently sun-dry and air out the grain during the rainy season, we can ensure that the grain does not go moldy despite the rainy season.

    霉雨不霉粮
    江苏射阳县大兴公社中联三队的三麦，今年获得了前所未有的大丰收。最近霉雨季节到来，队里的革命群众和革命干部，又一次及时地学习了毛主席“每年一定要把收割、保管、吃用三件事（收、管、吃）抓得很紧很紧”的教导，检查了三麦发霉情况。粗粗一看，绝大部分很干燥，仔细一查，有两个囤底的麦子受潮了，还有三十多斤发了霉。
    这次检查纠正了某些人的麻痹思想。越是丰收，越要节约；越是下雨，越要提高警惕，绝不让麦子发霉。最近，中联三队抢晴天，把三万多斤麦子全部进行了曝晒。

    毛主席教导我们，“每年一定要把收割、保管、吃用三件事（收、管、吃）抓得很紧很紧。”
    现在，大部分地区的夏粮已经进场入仓了，我们必须把保管这个环节抓得很紧很紧。如果稍一疏忽，就可能使到手的粮食受到不应有的损失。
    今年，有些地区雨水较多，给粮食保管工作带来一些困难，但是只要象射阳中联三队那样抓紧保管，在霉雨季节，抢晴天勤晒多晾，就可以做到霉雨季节不霉粮。
