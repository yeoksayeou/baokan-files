Patience and Diligence in Ideological Work
Lü Changling, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works from a certain unit of the Railway Corps

Sun Jiafeng, a student from the second year of middle school at Shijingshan, was deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and suppressed and attacked some revolutionary classmates. After the military training began, some classmates suggested, "This time we should really give him a good lesson"; others thought, "Talking to him is like 'playing the lute to a cow,' it's better not to bother with him."

How should we deal with this classmate? With this question in mind, I studied Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." Chairman Mao teaches us: "Ideological struggle is different from other struggles. It cannot adopt rough and coercive methods, but must use meticulous and persuasive methods." I thought: Little Sun comes from a bitter and deep-hated worker's family, and has deep class feelings for the Party and Chairman Mao. In the cultural revolution, he did some wrong things because he was deceived. The fault lies with him, but the root cause is with the biggest capitalist-roaders in the Party. We can only adopt an attitude of unity and help towards him, and we must not discriminate against him or attack him. Therefore, I and the classmates who had been suppressed studied Chairman Mao's teachings on the proletariat only being able to liberate the whole of humanity in order to liberate itself, making them understand the importance of uniting with the majority, changing their attitude towards Little Sun; at the same time, I personally did ideological work with Little Sun.

I followed the old methods of the army, first establishing a relationship with Little Sun. I often actively approached him, and whenever there was an opportunity, I would talk to him. In his studies and life, I cared for him in every way. Some of the class's work was also given to him to do, and any small achievement was praised. This method was effective, and he gradually became able to talk to me. However, whenever we talked about his suppression and attack on classmates, he would fly into a rage and not listen to a word I said. What was the reason for this? I thought and thought, and realized that the main reason Little Sun could not accept the classmates' criticism was that he lacked an understanding of the essence and harm of the bourgeois reactionary line. He himself had not been attacked or persecuted, so he could not hate the bourgeois reactionary line, and therefore had no self-criticism and determination. When I talked to him, I often wanted to stuff all the truths I knew into his brain at once, hoping he would immediately return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, thus unconsciously falling into the trap of impatience, violating the laws of ideological struggle. To make Little Sun change, I must arouse his hatred towards the bourgeois reactionary line, making him truly draw a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line in his thoughts and feelings.

Later, after careful observation, I found that he was not so hostile towards Yang Cuilan, so I tried to make him get closer to Little Yang. One day, I invited him to visit Little Yang's home. Upon entering the Yang's home, he sat sullenly to the side, waiting for others to "fire the first shot." Who would have thought that Little Yang's mother, seeing the soldiers and classmates come to visit her daughter, was deeply moved. She wept as she denounced the cruel oppression of her family by the Japanese devils and the Kuomintang, and the persecution of her daughter by the bourgeois reactionary line. As she spoke, she fainted. This scene deeply educated Little Sun. For the first time, he stood in the position of the victim to understand the bourgeois reactionary line, feeling that Little Yang's hatred was his own hatred. After leaving Little Yang's home, he was in a heavy mood. I seized this opportunity to talk to him again about the heinous crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line. Many words that he usually would not listen to, he now listened to with great attention. Then I took him to visit the homes of two persecuted classmates. This time, as soon as he entered the house, he sincerely urged the classmates to return to school to study and make revolution. Later, I studied Chairman Mao's works and relevant commentaries with him many times, making him further realize that he himself was also a victim of the bourgeois reactionary line. In the school's movement to criticize the bourgeois reactionary line, he took the lead in coming out to "counterattack," inspiring the other classmates who had been deceived in the class, and was warmly welcomed by everyone.

When the class and the entire school achieved great unity, a wrong wind blew, and some people insisted that the great unity of Shijingshan was a "big mix" and a "big hodgepodge." Little Sun also could not withstand the impact of this wrong wind and went out with a few classmates to form a small "faction," not attending school for two consecutive days. I was really disappointed: the hard work of more than two months was it all in vain? I really wanted to call Little Sun and give him a good scolding. However, I remembered Chairman Mao's teachings: "Our comrades must understand that ideological transformation is a long-term, patient, and meticulous work." I realized: a person's ideological transformation cannot be without setbacks. Little Sun's setback is a higher demand for my ideological work. The more it is at this time, the more I should enthusiastically do meticulous and patient ideological work, the more I should be patient, patient, and even more patient!

Why did Little Sun want to withdraw from the great unity? I couldn't find the reason for the time being. So, I went to Little Sun's home to talk to him, and studied Chairman Mao's instructions on military and political training with him, and seriously listened to his opinions. I learned that one of the reasons he withdrew from the great unity was that his views on a school leader differed from everyone else's, thinking that this cadre had many problems, and letting him participate in the great unity was a "big hodgepodge." I suggested to the revolutionary comrades that he participate in the investigation of this cadre's problems. The investigation results dispelled his doubts. At this time, I also helped him overcome his active thoughts of fearing to lose face when returning to school and fearing ridicule and sarcasm from classmates, helping him to muster his courage and firm his resolve, finally making him happily return to the class. With his help, the classmates who had withdrawn from the great unity with him also gradually returned to school to study and make revolution.

After this setback, Little Sun became much firmer. Later, when the school encountered several external impacts, he firmly maintained the revolutionary great unity with the revolutionary teachers and students of the entire school, maintaining Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Now, he has been elected by everyone as the service member of the Red Guards squad. Recently, in the summer harvest political field camp, he insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, took the lead in exposing his selfishness and private thoughts, actively took on heavy work, and was praised by his classmates.

    做思想工作要耐心细致
    铁道兵某部学习毛主席著作积极分子　吕长岭
    石景山中学初二同学孙家丰，在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，受到资产阶级反动路线的蒙蔽，压制、打击了一些革命同学。军训开始后，有的同学主张：“这回该好好整他一顿”；有的认为：“跟他讲道理是‘对牛弹琴’，干脆别理他。”
    应该怎样对待这个同学呢？我带着这个问题学习了毛主席的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》。毛主席教导我们：“思想斗争同其他的斗争不同，它不能采取粗暴的强制的方法，只能用细致的讲理的方法。”我想：小孙出身在一个苦大仇深的工人家庭，对党和毛主席有着深厚的阶级感情；他在文化大革命中干了一些错事，是因为受了蒙蔽，错在他身上，根子在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派。我们只能对他采取团结、帮助的态度，决不能歧视他、打击他。于是，我和受过压制的同学一起学习毛主席无产阶级只有解放全人类，才能解放自己的教导，使他们认识到团结大多数的重要意义，改变对小孙的态度；同时，亲自去做小孙的思想工作。
    我按照部队的老办法，先同小孙建立感情。我经常主动跟他接近，一有机会就找他谈心，在学习上、生活上处处关心他。班上有些工作，也交给他去做，有一点成绩就表扬。这个办法果然见效，他同我渐渐能谈到一起了。但是，一谈到他压制、打击同学的事情，他就火冒三丈，根本听不进我的话。这是什么原因呢？我想来想去，小孙所以不能接受同学的批评，主要是因为他对资产阶级反动路线的实质和危害缺乏认识。他自己没有受过打击、迫害，对资产阶级反动路线就恨不起来，因而也就没有自我批评的觉悟和决心。而我同他交谈的时候，往往想把自己懂得的道理一下子全部塞进他的脑子里，恨不得他马上回到毛主席的革命路线上来，这就不自觉地犯了急性病，违背了思想斗争的规律。要使小孙转变，就必须激发他对资产阶级反动路线的仇恨，使他从思想感情上真正同资产阶级反动路线划清界限。
    后来，我经过仔细观察，发现他对杨翠兰同学不那么敌视，就设法使他同小杨接近。有一天，我约他去访问小杨的家。进了杨家，他板着脸坐在一旁等待别人“打第一枪”。谁知小杨的妈妈看见解放军和同学来看望自己的女儿，说不出的感动。她流着热泪控诉了日本鬼子、国民党对她一家人的残酷压迫，控诉了资产阶级反动路线对她女儿的迫害，说着说着就昏倒了。这种情景，使小孙深受教育。他第一次站到受害者的地位来认识资产阶级反动路线，感到小杨的仇恨就是自己的仇恨。从小杨家出来，他心情很沉重。我抓住这个机会，又给他讲了资产阶级反动路线的滔天罪行。许多话平时他听不入耳，这时却听得格外专心。接着我又带他访问了两个受迫害同学的家。这回，他一进屋就诚恳地动员同学回校复课闹革命。以后，我多次同他一起学习毛主席著作和有关社论，使他进一步认识到自己也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。在学校开展批判资产阶级反动路线的群众运动中，他带头出来“杀回马枪”，带动了班里其他受蒙蔽的同学，受到了大家热情的欢迎。
    班里和全校实现了大联合的时候，刮来了一股歪风，有些人硬说石中的大联合是“大凑合”，“大杂烩”。小孙也经不起这股歪风的冲击，和班里几个同学拉出去另立了一个小“山头”，接连两天不到校。我心里好不泄气：辛辛苦苦做了两个多月的工作，这不是白费了吗！真想把小孙叫来狠狠说一顿。但是，我又记起了毛主席的教导：
  “我们的同志一定要懂得，思想改造的工作是长期的、耐心的、细致的工作”。我认识到：一个人的思想改造也不可能没有反复。小孙的反复是给自己的思想工作提出了更高的要求。越是在这种时候，自己越应该满腔热忱地去做艰苦细致的思想工作，越应该耐心，耐心，再耐心！
    小孙为什么要退出大联合呢？一时找不出原因。于是，我到小孙家里同他谈心，和他一起学习毛主席关于军政训练的指示，并且认真听取他的意见。了解到他退出大联合的原因之一，是对学校一个领导干部的看法与大家不同，认为这个干部问题多，让他参加大联合，就是“大杂烩”。我向革命派同学建议让他参加调查这个干部的问题，调查结果，解除了他的疑虑。这时，我又针对他怕回校丢面子，怕同学讽刺挖苦的活思想，帮助他鼓起勇气，坚定信心，终于使他愉快地回到班里。在他的帮助下，同他一起退出大联合的同学，也陆续回校复课闹革命。
    经过这次反复，小孙变得坚定多了。以后，学校又遇到几次外来的冲击，他都同全校革命师生一起，坚定地维护了革命大联合，维护了毛主席的革命路线。现在，他被大家选为红卫兵排的勤务员。最近在夏收政治野营中，他坚持活学活用毛主席著作，带头亮私心，斗私字，主动拣重活干，受到同学们的好评。
