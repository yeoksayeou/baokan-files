The Soviet revisionist leadership, while using the superstructure to accelerate the full restoration of capitalism, has also not forgotten to use music. They have brought the lowbrow and vulgar music of the West—jazz—into the Soviet Union to poison the people and the youth. The Khrushchev revisionists once invited American jazz bands to perform in the Soviet Union and personally attended the performances with their subordinates. After Brezhnev and Kosygin came to power, they held jazz music festivals in the Soviet Union every year, continuing to vigorously promote the market for jazz.

With the vigorous promotion of the Soviet revisionist clique, jazz music spread rapidly in the Soviet Union. From cities to villages, from enterprises to schools, one can hear this decadent music everywhere. Plays and films use jazz for their interludes, and television and radio frequently broadcast jazz special programs. In hotel restaurants, cafes, and summer markets, jazz is played or broadcast. In parks and squares, one often sees groups of young people dancing wildly to the accompaniment of jazz music.

专栏：看苏修怎样在国内复辟资本主义

　　靡靡之音到处流行
    苏修领导集团在利用上层建筑加速全面复辟资本主义的时候，也没有忘记利用音乐。他们把西方低级下流的靡靡之音——爵士音乐搬到苏联来，毒害人民和青年。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者曾把美国爵士乐队请到苏联去表演，并率领他的大小头目亲临捧场。勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流当政后，则在苏联年年举办爵士音乐节，继续卖力地为爵士乐开辟市场。
    经过苏修集团的大力推销，爵士音乐在苏联传播很快。从城市到乡村，从企业到学校，都可以听到这种靡靡之音。戏剧、电影的插曲，配爵士乐，电视和广播也经常安排爵士乐专题节目。旅馆的餐厅里、咖啡馆里，夏季市场上，也演奏或播送爵士乐。在公园里、广场上，经常可以看到三五成群的青年人，在爵士乐的伴奏下，疯狂地大跳摇摆舞。
