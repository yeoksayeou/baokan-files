	Do Not Take It Lightly
	Beijing zhengfa xueyuan zhengfa gongshe chunlei

	Recently, our revolutionary commune members had a vigorous debate on whether to build a large stage.

	At that time, some comrades thought that after a year of arduous and tortuous struggle, we have now taken power. Seizing the opportunity of the establishment of the revolutionary committee throughout the school, we should celebrate in a grand manner. Therefore, they advocated building a large stage on the west side of the playground for meetings and performances. This stage would be built with bricks around it, cemented on top, and a rest room built at the back. It would be large and beautiful, costing over 2,000 yuan. After the construction plan was announced, many comrades disagreed with this approach. They proposed a new plan: using the soil mound left over from the construction of the swimming pool on the west side of the playground, we should mobilize the students to build a rostrum by themselves. This way, it would not cost much money and would not require bricks or cement.

	Many comrades said, "Building what kind of rostrum is not a small matter, but a major principle issue. It is a matter of whether we are going to struggle hard, save money, and make revolution, or squander and waste. In the debate, one comrade said well: 'Our revolutionary rebels have changed from a minority to a majority, from being oppressed to being in power. Our position has undergone a fundamental change. If after taking power we do not strictly follow Chairman Mao's teaching of 'frugality in making revolution,' but instead spend lavishly, indulge in extravagance, show off, flaunt our power, and live in luxury, this is a great crime against the people, this is the style of a bourgeois bureaucrat. If we continue down this path, we will be hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie and will walk the path of peaceful evolution, repeating the mistakes of the capitalist-roaders within the Party. In the past, during the days of white terror, under the rule of the bourgeois reactionary line, our struggle was very difficult. Without broadcasting equipment, we shouted with our mouths; without printing machines, we carved by hand; without meeting rooms, we sat under big trees to hold meetings. Wasn't that also revolution? Now, can we not hold meetings and make revolution by standing on a soil platform? Comrade Jiao Yulu, a good student of Chairman Mao, used a broken table and a broken chair to make revolution. We can also make revolution by standing on a soil platform.' Another comrade said: 'Making revolution cannot pursue comfort. These comfortable things, we not only should not do, but even thinking about them is not appropriate. Whoever tries to make revolution comfortably will comfortably 'modify' themselves. We must never forget Chairman Mao's repeated admonition: we must continue to maintain the spirit of hard struggle.'"

	Finally, the preparatory group of the revolutionary committee adopted the suggestions of everyone, mobilizing all the revolutionary teachers and students of the school to work together. In a short time, they turned the soil mound on the west side of the playground into a rostrum. This not only saved a large amount of national expenditure, but more importantly, it provided a profound education in ideology.

	Through this incident, everyone further realized that after the proletarian revolutionaries took power, bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts hidden in the mind could easily grow; those class enemies who are unwilling to die always dream of restoring their lost 'paradise' and always try every means to corrupt and infiltrate the proletarian revolutionaries. Their most vicious trick is to open a gap in life and pull the proletarian revolutionaries down. Therefore, we must study and apply the "Three Articles" extensively, overcome various non-proletarian thoughts, continue to maintain the spirit of hard struggle, and firmly guard the gateway of life. This is not just a matter of saving a few yuan for the country, but a matter of whether to change the world with the proletarian worldview or the bourgeois worldview, a major issue of where the red political power is heading. It must not be taken lightly.

    不可等闲视之
    北京政法学院政法公社　春雷
    不久前，我们政法公社战士曾围绕是否修一个大舞台的问题展开了一场辩论。
    当时，有的同志认为，我们经过了一年的艰苦曲折的斗争，现在掌权了，乘全校成立革命委员会的机会，应该大张旗鼓地庆祝一番。因此，他们主张在操场西边修建一个大型舞台，供开会和演戏使用。这个舞台四周用砖砌，上面用水泥抹，后面还盖个休息室，又大又漂亮，要花两千多元。修建计划公布后，很多同志不同意这样做，他们提出了新的建议，主张把过去修建游泳池时堆积在操场西边的土丘，由同学们自己动手，改成主席台。这样，既不要花多少钱，又不用砖料水泥。
    不少同志说：“修一个什么样的主席台，这不是一件小事，而是一个重大的原则问题，是艰苦奋斗，节约闹革命，还是挥霍浪费的问题。”在辩论中，有个同志说得好：“我们革命造反派由少数变成了多数，由受压制变成了当权者，地位发生了根本变化。如果在掌权以后不坚决按照毛主席的‘要节约闹革命’的教导办事，而是大手大脚，铺张浪费，闹排场，抖威风，讲阔气，这就是对人民的极大犯罪，这就是资产阶级官老爷作风。如此发展下去，就有被资产阶级糖衣炮弹打中的危险，就会走上和平演变的道路，重蹈党内走资本主义道路当权派的覆辙。过去，在白色恐怖的日子里，在资产阶级反动路线统治下，我们的斗争很困难，没有广播器材，就用嘴喊，没有印刷机，就用手刻写，没有会议室，就坐在大树下开会，哪有什么主席台？不是同样干革命吗？现在，难道站在土台子上就不能开会，不能革命了吗？毛主席的好学生焦裕禄同志用破桌子，坐破椅子，照样干革命，我们站在土台子上也同样能干革命。”还有的同志说：“干革命决不能追求舒服，这些舒舒服服的事情，我们不但不能去做，就是连想也不该去想，谁企图舒舒服服地干革命，谁就会舒舒服服地‘修’掉。我们万万不可忘记毛主席的谆谆告诫：务必使同志们继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风。”
    最后，革命委员会筹备小组采纳了大家的建议，发动全院革命师生一齐动手，在很短的时间内就把操场西边的土丘修成了主席台。这样做，不仅为国家节约了很大一笔开支，更重要的是从思想上经受了一次深刻的教育。
    通过这件事，大家进一步认识到无产阶级革命派掌权以后，潜伏在脑子中的资产阶级思想和小资产阶级思想很容易滋长；那些不甘心死亡的阶级敌人总在梦想恢复失去的“天堂”，总是在千方百计地对无产阶级革命派进行腐蚀侵袭，而其最毒辣的一手，就是从生活上打开缺口，拉无产阶级革命派下水。因此，我们必须大学大用
  “老三篇”，克服各种非无产阶级思想，继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风，牢牢地把住生活的关口。这样做不仅仅是为国家节约几个钱的问题，而是用无产阶级世界观改造世界，还是用资产阶级世界观改造世界的问题，是关系到红色政权向何处去的重大问题。切切不可等闲视之。
