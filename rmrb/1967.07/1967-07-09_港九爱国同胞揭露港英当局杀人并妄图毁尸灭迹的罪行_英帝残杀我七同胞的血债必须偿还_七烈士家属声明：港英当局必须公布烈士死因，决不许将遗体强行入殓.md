	Hong Kong and Kowloon Patriots Expose the Crime of the British Authorities in Killing People and Attempting to Destroy Evidence
	The Blood Debt of the British Empire for Killing Seven of Our Compatriots Must Be Repayed
	Statement by the Families of the Seven Martyrs: The British Authorities Must Disclose the Cause of Death of the Martyrs and Must Not Forcefully Seal the Corpses

	New China News Agency, Hong Kong, July 7th - The Hong Kong and Kowloon Anti-British Oppression Struggle Committee decided late on the night of the 6th to call on patriotic compatriots from all walks of life to expose the crimes of the British authorities in refusing to return the bodies of the martyrs and obstructing the holding of funeral services for the martyrs. The committee also called on patriotic compatriots from all walks of life to widely hold protest meetings and memorial services for the anti-British and anti-violence martyrs, and to continue to mobilize and organize the masses to prepare to participate in the funeral of the seven martyrs.

	The decision stated: On June 23rd, the British fascist authorities launched a brutal suppression of the Rubber and Plastic Industry General Union, committing a heinous massacre. Up to now, it has been confirmed that in this massacre, rubber worker Deng Ziqiang was shot and killed by British police on that day, and among the dozens of rubber workers arrested, Zhou Songsheng and Luo Jinguo were brutally killed in the British police station. On June 26th, the British authorities arrested Li An, a carving worker from the Shaw Brothers Studio, and beat him to death in the police station. This is the latest blood debt owed by the wicked British fascist authorities to the Chinese people after the "June 8th" massacre in which they killed our patriotic workers Xu Tianbo, Li Song, and Zeng Ming!

	The decision pointed out: The British authorities owe a heavy blood debt to the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon, which must be repaid in full and cannot be denied. We must avenge the seven known martyrs!

	What is particularly infuriating is that after killing people, the British authorities attempted to destroy evidence and intimidate the families of the martyrs, refusing to disclose the cause of death of the seven martyrs and refusing to return their bodies, obstructing the holding of funeral services for the martyrs. The families of the martyrs have repeatedly lodged the strongest protests to the British authorities and on June 29th, submitted five serious demands to the British authorities, including disclosing the cause of death of the martyrs, punishing the culprits, compensating, erecting a monument for the martyrs, and not interfering with the funeral. The deadline has now passed, and we solemnly warn the British authorities: The cause of death of the seven martyrs must be disclosed immediately, the bodies of the martyrs must be returned in full, and the demands of the families of the martyrs must be fully met. Attempts to shirk responsibility are absolutely unacceptable.

	The decision stated: The seven martyrs died for the dignity of the Chinese nation, for the defense of the great Mao Zedong Thought, for resisting the savage persecution of British imperialism, and for the interests of the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. They died a worthy and glorious death—their fearless revolutionary spirit is worthy of our eternal remembrance. The families of the seven martyrs are not deceived by the British authorities and are not afraid of their intimidation, showing a tenacious fighting spirit, which is worthy of our respect. The Hong Kong and Kowloon Anti-British Oppression Struggle Committee hereby announces: The "Anti-British and Anti-Violence Martyrs Xu Tianbo, Li Song, Zeng Ming Funeral Committee," originally composed of 148 people including the chairman Yang Guang, is renamed the "Anti-British and Anti-Violence Seven Martyrs Funeral Committee," and will continue to handle the funeral arrangements for the seven martyrs. The committee also decided to give each family of the martyrs Deng Ziqiang, Zhou Songsheng, Luo Jinguo, and Li An a condolence payment of 30,000 yuan. As for compensation and pensions, the British authorities will be fully responsible.

	New China News Agency, Hong Kong, July 8th - The British authorities, fearing that their fascist atrocities of killing our compatriots would be exposed to the world, announced on the 7th that they would hastily seal the coffins of the seven anti-British and anti-violence martyrs Xu Tianbo, Li Song, Zeng Ming, Deng Ziqiang, Zhou Songsheng, Luo Jinguo, and Li An, in order to carry out their unspoken conspiracy. The families of the seven martyrs issued a joint emergency statement at noon on the 8th, expressing their firm opposition and strong protest.

	The statement said: The British fascist authorities killed our relatives and have been delaying the disclosure of the cause of death, attempting to shirk responsibility. After the Hong Kong and Kowloon Anti-British Oppression Struggle Committee issued the decision to hold funeral services for the seven anti-British and anti-violence martyrs, the British authorities hurriedly tried to forcibly seal the coffins of our seven martyrs, which is unacceptable. We solemnly declare: First, we will not allow the British fascist authorities to delay and evade responsibility; they must honestly disclose the cause of death of the seven martyrs; second, we will not allow the British fascist authorities to continue their reckless behavior and forcibly seal and nail the coffins of our relatives; third, all matters related to the funeral of the seven martyrs must be and can only be decided and handled by the families of the seven martyrs and the funeral committee.

	On the 7th, the families and friends of the seven martyrs also held a press conference, angrily condemning the British authorities for refusing to disclose the cause of death of the martyrs and delaying the response to the serious demands for punishing the culprits, compensating, erecting a monument for the martyrs, and not interfering with the funeral, and issued a joint statement on this matter. The statement seriously demanded: First, the British authorities must immediately accept the five demands submitted by the families of the martyrs on June 29th; second, the British government must extradite the mastermind of the killings, Dai Linzhi, to Hong Kong and hand him over to the Chinese compatriots in Hong Kong for a public trial; third, we decide to hold a joint funeral for our relatives.

	The Anti-British and Anti-Violence Seven Martyrs Funeral Committee also issued a statement on the 7th, supporting the joint statement of the families of the martyrs. The statement expressed heartfelt admiration for the families' clear understanding of the situation and their courage to resist violence.

　　港九爱国同胞揭露港英当局杀人并妄图毁尸灭迹的罪行
　　英帝残杀我七同胞的血债必须偿还
　　七烈士家属声明：港英当局必须公布烈士死因，决不许将遗体强行入殓
    新华社香港七日电  港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会六日深夜作出决定，号召各界爱国同胞揭露港英当局拒绝交还烈士遗体，阻拦为烈士举行葬礼的罪行。斗委会还号召各界爱国同胞广泛举行控诉会和为反英抗暴烈士举行追悼会，并继续发动和组织广大群众，准备参加为七烈士举行的葬礼。
    决定说：港英法西斯当局在六月二十三日围攻树胶塑胶业总工会，进行灭绝人性的大镇压，造成骇人听闻的大血案。到现在为止，已经查明在这次大血案中，我胶业工人邓自强当天被港英警察开枪打死，在被捕去的数十名胶业工人中，又有邹松胜和罗进苟二人在港英警署内惨遭杀害。六月二十六日，港英当局逮捕了邵氏制片厂雕花工人李安，又在警署内将他活活打死。这是万恶的港英法西斯当局继“六·八”血案杀害我爱国工人徐田波、黎松、曾明之后，对中国人民欠下的一笔新的血债！
    决定指出：港英当局欠下我港九同胞的累累血债，必须逐笔偿还，绝对不容抵赖。我们一定要为已知的七位死难烈士报仇！
    尤其令人愤慨的是，港英当局在杀人之后，还企图毁尸灭迹，并对烈士家属进行恐吓和拒绝交代七位烈士的死因，拒绝交还烈士遗体，阻挠为烈士举行殡葬。我烈士遗属已为此分别向港英当局多次提出最愤怒的抗议，并在六月二十九日向港英提出限期公布烈士死因、惩凶、赔偿、为烈士们立碑和不准干涉葬礼等五项严正要求。现在限期已满，我们严正警告港英当局：七位烈士的死因必须立即交代，烈士遗体必须全部交还，烈属们的要求必须全部实现，妄图推卸罪责是绝对办不到的。
    决定说：七位烈士为维护中华民族的尊严，为捍卫伟大的毛泽东思想，为反抗英帝国主义的野蛮迫害，为港九中国同胞的利益而死，是死得其所，死得光荣——他们不怕牺牲的革命精神值得我们永远怀念。七位烈士的遗属不受港英的欺骗，不怕港英的恐吓，表现了顽强的斗争意志，值得我们敬佩。港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会特宣布：原由斗委会主任委员杨光等一百四十八人组成的“反英抗暴死难烈士徐田波、黎松、曾明治丧委员会”，改名为“反英抗暴死难七烈士治丧委员会”，继续筹办七烈士的殡葬事宜。斗委会还决定发给邓自强、邹松胜、罗进苟、李安每位烈属慰问金三万元。至于赔偿和抚恤金，将由港英当局完全负责。
    新华社香港八日电港英当局害怕它残杀我同胞的法西斯暴行罪证公诸于世，七日竟宣布要将徐田波、黎松、曾明、邓自强、邹松胜、罗进苟和李安七位反英抗暴死难烈士的遗体草草入殓，以遂其不可告人的阴谋。七烈士遗属为此在八日中午发表联合紧急声明，表示坚决反对，并提出强烈的抗议。
    声明说：港英法西斯当局杀死了我们的亲人，一直拖延不肯公布死因，妄图推卸罪责。当我港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会发出为反英抗暴死难七烈士治丧的决定以后，港英当局就急急忙忙地要把我七烈士的遗体强行入殓，这是令人无法容忍的。我们严正声明：一，决不容许港英法西斯当局拖延狡赖，必须老老实实地公布七烈士的死因；二，决不容许港英法西斯当局继续胡作非为，将我们的亲人遗体强行入殓钉封；三，有关七烈士的一切殡葬事宜，必须而且只能由我七烈士遗属和治丧委员会决定办理。
    七位烈士的家属和亲友七日还举行记者招待会，愤怒谴责港英当局拒绝公布烈士死因和拖延答复惩凶、赔偿，为烈士们立碑和不准干涉葬礼等严正要求，并就此发表联合声明。声明严正要求：一、港英当局必须立即接受烈士家属在六月二十九日提出的五项要求；二、英国政府必须把杀人的罪魁祸首戴麟趾押回香港，交给香港中国同胞公审；三、我们决定为亲人联合举葬。
    反英抗暴死难七烈士治丧委员会七日也发表声明，支持烈士遗属的联合声明，声明对烈属们深明大义，奋起抗暴的精神，表示衷心敬佩。
