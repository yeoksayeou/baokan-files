According to Xinhua News Agency, Harbin: This year, the wheat in Heilongjiang Province has grown uniformly well, with tall stalks, large ears, and many grains, making it a rare good year. The people of the entire province believe that this is a bountiful fruit of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. Currently, the community members of the people's communes in the vast rural areas and the revolutionary workers of the state farms are taking urgent action, using the great criticism of the revolution as a driving force, and launching a tense wheat harvesting battle.

Recently, the Heilongjiang Provincial Revolutionary Committee issued an urgent directive to mobilize everyone to harvest the wheat in a timely manner, calling on the revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses of the entire province to secure all the harvested wheat. The Heilongjiang Military Region also issued a mobilization order, calling on the militia of the entire province to actively mobilize and quickly join the wheat harvesting battle.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Guiyang: The various ethnic poor and lower-middle peasants of Guizhou Province have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, seized the revolution, and promoted production. They have overcome the difficulties of prolonged drought and completed the arduous summer planting tasks.

Now, various grain crops in Guizhou are lush and growing well, especially corn, which is growing very well. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in various places are strengthening field management, striving to achieve a bumper harvest of autumn grain on the basis of a bumper harvest of summer grain.

In the intense summer harvesting and planting work, the revolutionary factions and the broad revolutionary masses and cadres in various places have raised high the revolutionary banner of criticizing Mao Zedong Thought, concentrating their efforts to criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. At the same time, they have combined local struggle, criticism, and transformation, exposed, criticized, and struck at the sabotage activities of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party and the reactionary elements of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in the local area. This has powerfully promoted the current production work.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Jinan, July 13: In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Shandong Province has seen a significant increase in the procurement of live pigs and fresh eggs. Compared to the same period last year, the procurement of live pigs has increased by 84 percent, and fresh eggs by 45 percent. Due to the significant increase in procurement, not only has the supply of the urban and rural markets in the entire province been guaranteed, but it has also provided abundant sources for supporting exports and other provinces. In the first half of the year, the amount of frozen meat and live pigs sent to other provinces by Shandong increased by more than nine times compared to the same period last year, and fresh eggs increased by thirty-five and a half times. The export of pigs and eggs also saw a significant increase.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has greatly promoted the development of agricultural production in various places in Shandong. Many regions have seen an increase in pigs, fertilizer, and grain production. To quickly and efficiently procure live pigs and fresh eggs to meet the needs of urban and rural markets and further support production development, the revolutionary factions of the provincial food company system have armed their minds with Mao Zedong Thought, fully mobilized the masses, relied on the masses, overcame all difficulties, and strove to complete the procurement and supply tasks. The broad revolutionary staff of the food company system in the entire province have also actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "save and make revolution," using every means to reduce turnover costs. In the first half of the year, the operating cost level was reduced by 0.96 percent compared to the same period last year.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Xining: In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the production of livestock products on the Qinghai grasslands has seen a significant improvement. According to statistics from relevant departments, by the end of June, out of the 22 planned procurement items, 17 main items have seen varying degrees of increase compared to the same period last year. Among them, wool, cow hair, cowhide, and sheep skins have seen a doubling in growth, while cashmere, camel hair, horse tails, yak tails, sheep intestines, and goat skins have also seen a significant increase.

The broad revolutionary herdsmen of Qinghai, through studying Chairman Mao's works and revolutionary criticism, have promoted the revolutionization of their thoughts. They have directed the revolutionary enthusiasm ignited during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution into production, and after achieving a bumper harvest of lambs, foals, and calves and other large and small livestock, they have timely invested in the production of livestock products such as shearing and shearing wool. This year, the wool production on the Qinghai grasslands will exceed any year in history, and the wool has a high oil content and good luster. The local military and the "August 18" revolutionary factions of the procurement departments have also gone deep into the pastoral areas, assisted in production, and procured livestock products. At the same time, they have vigorously promoted Chairman Mao's theories, lines, principles, and policies on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and promoted the great significance of "seizing the revolution and promoting production," which has been warmly welcomed by the revolutionary herdsmen of various ethnic groups.
