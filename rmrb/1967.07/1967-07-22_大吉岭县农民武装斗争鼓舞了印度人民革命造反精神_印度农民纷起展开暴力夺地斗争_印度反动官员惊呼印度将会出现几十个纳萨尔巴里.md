The armed struggle of farmers in Darjeeling County, led by the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, has greatly inspired the oppressed and exploited farmers of India. Farmers in many places have risen up to launch "Naxalbari-style" struggles, fiercely opposing the reactionary government and big landlords of India.

According to a report by the *Indian Express* on July 4, farmers in the Damatiya area of Tufanganj in the Kuch Behar district of West Bengal, under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, have also launched a struggle to seize land from landlords. They have hoisted red flags on the seized land. Their rebellious actions have caused great alarm among the big and small landlords in the area, who fear that a "second Naxalbari" may emerge. In late June, farmers in the Sitalkuchi area of this district and in the neighboring Nagrakata district seized land from big landlords and attacked them.

According to a report by Agence France-Presse on July 10, the violent struggle of farmers has spread to Tirjala, about 20 miles east of Calcutta. There, farmers have seized land from landlords and hoisted red flags in the area.

Since June, Indian newspapers have reported that in the southern part of Sundarbans in West Bengal, a place with a history of peasant uprisings, landless agricultural workers are launching violent resistance against large landowners who are dismissing agricultural workers (in reality, landless laborers). In the districts of Hugli, Twenty-four Parganas, Sonarpur, Midnapore, and Birbhum in this province, the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India is organizing violent struggles among the farmers.

The *Statesman* reported on July 6 that in Karat, Kerala, there was a "Naxalbari-style" conflict between farmers and landlords. The report said that the police are facing a tense situation and encountering "organized resistance" there. The violent struggle of farmers has caused great panic in the non-Congress government of the province. The Chief Minister of Kerala quickly dispatched the Deputy Inspector General of Police from the northern region along with police forces to suppress the movement.

The *Indian Express* reported on July 1 that in the southern forest area of Tripura in eastern India, tribal farmers have also launched "Naxalbari-style" violent struggles. More than a thousand farmers destroyed the local forestry department.

According to reports, in Andhra Pradesh, over the past three months, the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India has launched the "Naxalbari" movement in some areas of Nalgonda district, where the armed struggle first broke out in 1946. According to the *Statesman*, recently in various parts of Assam, many slogans have appeared, reading: "The path of Naxalbari is our path."

The continuous development of the armed struggle of farmers in Darjeeling County and the rise of farmers in other places to oppose the reactionary government of India have caused great alarm among the reactionary government of India. Recently, Biswanath Mukherjee, the Minister of Irrigation of West Bengal, exclaimed that the farmers of West Bengal "will create dozens of Naxalbaris across the province." The Chief Minister of Assam, Charan, also cried out that the trend of the farmers' movement in Assam is "very dangerous." The Indian Minister of Home Affairs, Chavan, admitted that the latest events have caused "great unease" in the Indian government.

The Japanese newspaper *Yomiuri Shimbun* recently said: "There are signs that the peasant uprising in Naxalbari may develop from a social problem in the border areas of India into an urgent political problem that shakes the Indira Gandhi regime."

"A single spark can start a prairie fire." No matter how the imperialists, Indian reactionaries, and modern revisionists collaborate to destroy and suppress the revolutionary struggle of the peasants, the armed struggle sparked by the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India and the revolutionary peasants in Darjeeling County will spread like wildfire across India.

    大吉岭县农民武装斗争鼓舞了印度人民革命造反精神
    印度农民纷起展开暴力夺地斗争
    印度反动官员惊呼印度将会出现几十个纳萨尔巴里
    新华社二十一日讯  新德里消息：印度共产党革命派领导的大吉岭县的农民武装斗争，极大地鼓舞了印度被压迫和被剥削的农民。不少地方的农民，纷纷起来开展“纳萨尔巴里式”的斗争，大造印度反动政府和大地主的反。
    据《印度斯坦旗报》四日报道，西孟加拉邦库奇比哈尔县图方甘吉区达马蒂亚地区的农民，在印共革命派领导下也开展了向地主夺地的斗争。他们在夺到的土地上树起了红旗。他们的造反行动已使这个地区的大、小地主“十分惊恐”，“担心那里会出现第二个纳萨尔巴里”。六月下旬，在这个县的西塔尔库奇地区和毗邻不丹的纳格拉卡塔县，农民夺占了大地主的土地，袭击了大地主。
    据法新社十日报道，农民暴力斗争已扩展到加尔各答以东约二十英里的蒂尔贾拉。那里的农民夺取了地主的土地，并在这个地区挂起了红旗。
    从六月份以来印度报纸陆续报道，在西孟加拉邦松达班斯南部这个在历史上曾经发生过农民起义的地方，无地雇农正在开展暴力反抗大农场主解雇农业工人（实际上是雇农）的运动。在这个邦的胡格里县、二十四—帕加纳斯县的索那浦尔地区、米德纳浦、比尔浦姆等县的一些地区，印度共产党革命派正在农民中发动暴力斗争。
    《政治家报》六日报道，在喀拉拉邦卡拉图尔，农民和地主之间爆发了
  “纳萨尔巴里式”的冲突，报道说，警察面临着遍布那里的紧张局势，遇到了“有组织的抵抗”。那里的农民暴力斗争已引起“非国大党”邦政府的一片惊慌。喀拉拉邦首席部长急忙派了北部地区的警察副总监同警察部队立即前往镇压。
    《印度时报》一日报道，在印度东部特里普拉南部森林区，部族农民也开展了“纳萨尔巴里式”的暴力斗争。一千多名农民捣毁了当地林业局。
    据报道，在安得拉邦，近三个月来，印共革命派在一九四六年特仑甘纳地区武装斗争首先爆发的地方拿尔冈达县的一些地区开展了“纳萨尔巴里”运动。据《政治家报》报道，最近在阿萨姆邦各地出现了许多标语，写着：“纳萨尔巴里的道路就是我们的道路。”
    大吉岭县农民武装斗争的不断发展和其它地方的农民纷纷起来大造印度反动政府的反，使印度反动政府大为惊恐。西孟加拉邦政府灌溉部长比斯瓦纳特·慕克吉最近惊呼，西孟加拉邦农民“将会在全邦各地造成几十个纳萨尔巴里”。阿萨姆邦首席部长恰利哈也大叫阿萨姆邦农民运动的趋向“十分危险”。印度内政部长恰范承认，最新的事件引起印度政府“很大的不安”。
    日本报纸《读卖新闻》最近说：“有迹象表明，纳萨尔巴里的农民起义可能从印度边区的社会问题发展成为震撼英迪拉·甘地政权的紧急政治问题。”
    “星星之火，可以燎原。”不管帝国主义、印度反动派和现代修正主义如何配合起来对革命农民的斗争进行破坏和镇压，印共革命派和革命农民在大吉岭县点起的武装斗争的星星之火，必将以燎原之势，燃向印度全国。
