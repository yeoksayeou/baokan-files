In recent days, the brave proletarian revolutionaries and workers, peasants, and soldiers of Wuhan have, in order to defend Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao, engaged in a fierce and arduous struggle, achieving tremendous feats.

With a fearless revolutionary spirit, they have repelled the ferocious attacks of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military in Wuhan, and smashed the evil plots of a small number of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who adhered to the bourgeois reactionary line. This is a new victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

The proletarian revolutionaries of Wuhan have emerged from their struggle against a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military and the bourgeois reactionary line they promoted. Their direction of struggle is correct. They are the core of the broad revolutionary alliance in Wuhan and the hope for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan. They are also an example for the proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses throughout the country to learn from.

Currently, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan is excellent, and the enemy has been politically isolated. However, as Chairman Mao teaches us, "The enemy's isolation does not mean our victory. If we make mistakes in our policies, we still cannot achieve victory."

The enemies of the proletariat will not accept their defeat. To save themselves from annihilation, they will not only resist fiercely but also spread rumors and use new tricks to plot new conspiracies. We must not be complacent and must remain highly vigilant a thousand times over.

In the face of a great enemy, all revolutionary mass organizations must further unite firmly, concentrate their targets, and focus their firepower on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in Wuhan. At this critical moment, we must be especially vigilant against the class enemy's attempts to sow discord.

The proletarian revolutionaries must be good at enlightening, educating, and winning over all the deceived masses, urging them to turn against their former leaders and expose the handful of bad leaders and their backstage manipulators, and return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They must not retaliate against them. Lu Xun said, "Because they come from the old stronghold, they see the situation more clearly, and turning against the enemy, they can strike a fatal blow to the strong enemy." The deceived masses breaking away from the influence and control of a handful of bad leaders and joining the ranks of the proletarian revolutionaries is an important condition for completely isolating a handful of unrepentant reactionaries.

Wuhan is a heroic city with a glorious revolutionary tradition. The people of Wuhan are heroic people. The great struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has tempered the broad revolutionary masses of Wuhan. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, and with the firm support of the proletarian revolutionaries and the People's Liberation Army throughout the country, the broad revolutionary masses of Wuhan will surely achieve a complete victory in this great struggle!

In praise of the brave revolutionary masses of Wuhan!

    向武汉的广大革命群众致敬！
    近几天来，武汉地区英勇的无产阶级革命派和工农兵，为着保卫毛主席，保卫林副主席，保卫党中央，保卫中央文革小组，保卫毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，经历了艰苦卓绝的搏斗，创造了非常巨大的业绩。
    他们以大无畏的革命精神，反击了武汉地区党内军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的猖狂进攻，粉碎了“百万雄师”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头的罪恶阴谋，这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的新胜利。
    武汉地区的无产阶级革命派，是在同一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其推行的资产阶级反动路线作斗争中“杀”出来的。他们的斗争大方向是正确的。他们是武汉地区最广泛的革命大联合的核心，是武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命胜利的希望，是全国无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众学习的榜样。
    现在，武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命的形势大好，敌人已经在政治上孤立了。但是，正如毛主席教导我们的，“敌人的孤立并不就等于我们的胜利。我们如果在政策上犯了错误，还是不能取得胜利。”
    无产阶级的敌人是不会甘心自己的失败的。为了挽救自己的灭顶之灾，他们不仅会进行疯狂的抵抗，而且还会造谣惑众，使出新的花样，策划新的阴谋。我们决不能掉以轻心，必须千百倍地保持高度的警惕。
    大敌当前，一切革命群众组织，必须进一步地巩固地联合起来，集中目标，集中火力，把斗争矛头对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在武汉地区的代理人。在这样的关键时刻，要特别警惕阶级敌人的挑拨离间。
    无产阶级革命派要善于启发、教育和争取一切受蒙蔽的群众，促使他们反戈一击，大造一小撮坏头头及其幕后操纵者的反，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，而不能对他们进行打击报复。鲁迅说过：“因为从旧垒中来，情形看得较为分明，反戈一击，易制强敌的死命。”受蒙蔽的群众从一小撮坏头头影响和控制下解脱出来，加入无产阶级革命派的战斗行列，这是使一小撮至死不悟的反动家伙彻底孤立的一个重要条件。
    武汉，是具有光荣的革命传统的英雄城市。武汉的人民，是英雄的人民。无产阶级文化大革命的伟大斗争，锻炼了武汉的广大革命群众。而武汉的广大革命群众，在毛主席和党中央的领导下，在全国无产阶级革命派和人民解放军的坚决支持下，必将赢得这场伟大斗争的彻底胜利！
    向英勇的武汉广大革命群众致敬！
