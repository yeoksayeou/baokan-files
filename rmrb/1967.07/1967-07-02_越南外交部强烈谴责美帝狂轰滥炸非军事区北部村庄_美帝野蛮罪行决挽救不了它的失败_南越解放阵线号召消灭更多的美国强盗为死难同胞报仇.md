The Vietnamese Foreign Ministry strongly condemns the U.S. imperialist's indiscriminate bombing of villages in the northern part of the demilitarized zone. The U.S. imperialist's barbaric crimes cannot save it from failure. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam calls for the annihilation of more American aggressors to avenge the fallen compatriots.

	New China News Agency, Hanoi: The Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on June 27, strongly condemning the U.S. imperialist aggressors' indiscriminate bombing of several villages in the northern part of the demilitarized zone on June 20, 21, and 23.

	The statement said that this is another new and extremely despicable crime committed by the U.S. imperialists, far surpassing the barbaric crimes committed by the Hitler fascists in some places. The U.S. imperialists' relentless attacks on many villages in the demilitarized zone prove that the U.S. aggressors are deliberately destroying all villages in the demilitarized zone. This is part of their conspiracy to intensify and expand the war in Vietnam.

	The statement pointed out that the U.S. government must bear full responsibility for all the consequences of its evil actions in the demilitarized zone. No matter how barbaric the actions of the U.S. aggressors are, they cannot subdue the Vietnamese people and cannot save the aggressors from their obvious failure in Vietnam.

	The statement calls on the governments and peoples of all countries who love peace and justice to strongly support the Vietnamese people's just struggle, to severely condemn the U.S. aggressors' leveling of villages in the demilitarized zone and other heinous crimes, and to resolutely stop the blood-stained hands of U.S. imperialist aggressors.

	According to the New China News Agency, Hanoi, June 1: The Voice of South Vietnam Liberation Radio broadcasted that the Central Committee of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a statement on June 29, strongly condemning the U.S. aggressors' recent continuous and indiscriminate bombing of villages in the northern part of the demilitarized zone in Vinh Quang Commune, which is an extremely serious crime.

	The statement pointed out that the U.S. imperialists' bombing and shelling of villages in the northern part of the demilitarized zone to destroy them proves that the U.S. aggressors are deliberately destroying the demilitarized zone, intensifying and expanding the war of aggression in South Vietnam and North Vietnam, and arrogantly provoking the Vietnamese people and other peace-loving and freedom-loving peoples of the world.

	The statement said that the U.S. imperialists' extremely barbaric actions further expose their fascist and warlike nature, unmasking their "peace" deception.

	The statement expressed extreme indignation at the U.S. imperialists' new brutal actions and fully supported the statement issued by the Foreign Ministry of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam on June 27.

	The statement called on the people of South Vietnam and the liberation armed forces to further raise their fighting spirit, together with the people of the whole country, to resolutely annihilate more U.S. aggressors and puppet troops, and avenge the harmed compatriots.

    新华社河内电　越南民主共和国外交部六月二十七日发表一项声明，强烈谴责美帝国主义侵略者二十日、二十一日和二十三日对非军事区北部的几个村庄进行狂轰滥炸的罪行。
    声明说，这是美帝国主义者犯下的又一新的极其卑鄙的罪行，它远远超过了当年希特勒法西斯分子在一些地方犯下的野蛮罪行。美帝国主义者对非军事区的许多村庄发动的夜以继日的袭击证明，美国侵略者正在蓄意毁灭非军事区的全部村庄。这是他们加紧和扩大越南战争阴谋的一部分。
    声明指出，美国政府必须对它在非军事区进行的罪恶行动引起的一切后果负完全责任。美国侵略者的任何行动，不管怎样野蛮，都不能使越南人民屈服，也不能挽救侵略者在越南的明显的失败。
    声明呼吁各国爱好和平和主持正义的政府和人民，大力地支持越南人民的正义斗争，严正谴责美国侵略者夷平非军事区村庄和犯下的其他滔天罪行，坚决制止美帝国主义侵略者的血手。
    据新华社河内一日电　据越南南方解放电台广播：越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会发言人二十九日发表声明，强烈谴责美国侵略者最近连续滥肆轰炸非军事区北部永广乡的村庄的极为严重的罪行。
    声明指出，美帝国主义为了把非军事区北部地区的村庄毁灭掉而进行的轰炸和炮击，证明美国侵略者正在处心积虑地破坏非军事区，加剧和扩大在越南南方和北方的侵略战争，蛮横地向越南人民和世界其他爱好和平和自由的人民挑衅。
    声明说，美帝国主义这种极端野蛮的行动，进一步暴露了他们法西斯和好战的本性，揭穿了他们的“和平”骗局。
    声明对美帝新的残酷行为极为愤慨。并且表示完全支持越南民主共和国外交部六月二十七日的声明。
    声明号召越南南方人民和解放武装力量进一步提高斗志，同全国人民一道，坚决消灭更多的美国侵略者和伪军，替受害同胞报仇。
