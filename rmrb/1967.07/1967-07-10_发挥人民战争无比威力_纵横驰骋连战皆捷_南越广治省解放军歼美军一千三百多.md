The brave and skilled armed forces of the South Vietnamese province of Quang Tri, from July 2 to 6, roamed freely and achieved victories in every battle in the Yu An commune of Yu Ling county and along the Ninth Highway. They annihilated over 1,300 American invaders, including the complete annihilation of six companies and the severe mauling of two companies; they destroyed or damaged sixteen enemy tanks and shot down two enemy aircraft. The remarkable achievements of the liberation forces in just five days dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. Marine Corps stationed near the demilitarized zone, causing the enemy to be in a state of panic.

On July 2, the U.S. Marine Corps suffered the annihilation of three companies and the severe mauling of two companies in the Yu An commune. Despite their losses, they were not willing to admit defeat. On the morning of July 6, they dispatched three companies of invaders, supported by aircraft and artillery, to launch another attack on the Yu An commune. However, they were quickly intercepted by the liberation forces and suffered heavy losses, with 150 casualties and six tanks destroyed or damaged.

While the three companies of American aggressors were suffering defeats, the 1st and 3rd Battalions of the 3rd Marine Regiment also sent several detachments to sneak into the Yu An commune. These American soldiers were cowardly and advanced very slowly.

At 3:30 PM, the liberation forces launched a fierce assault on the enemy from all directions, using heavy weapons to continuously bombard the American aggressors. The assault teams coordinated closely with the artillery, cleverly and flexibly charging into the enemy's positions from all sides and engaging in close combat. They divided the enemy into small groups and annihilated them one by one. Under the heavy blows of the liberation forces, the American troops suffered heavy casualties, and the remaining enemy fled in disarray. At the same time, the liberation forces also launched a fierce artillery attack on the American artillery positions in Dong River, Yu Temple, and Kun Tian.

After three hours of fierce battle, the liberation forces completely controlled the enemy's positions, annihilating three companies of the U.S. Marine Corps. Thus, on July 6, the liberation forces of Quang Tri province achieved a remarkable victory, annihilating nearly 600 American troops, including the complete annihilation of three companies, destroying or damaging thirteen enemy tanks, and shooting down one enemy aircraft.

　　发挥人民战争无比威力　纵横驰骋连战皆捷
　　南越广治省解放军歼美军一千三百多
    据新华社河内九日电  据越南南方解放通讯社报道，英勇善战的越南南方广治省解放武装力量，从七月二日到六日在犹灵县犹安乡和第九号公路上纵横驰骋，连战皆捷，共歼灭美国侵略军一千三百多名，其中包括全歼六个连和重创两个连；击毁击伤敌人坦克十六辆，击落敌机两架。解放武装力量在短短五天内取得的辉煌战果给盘踞在紧靠非军事区一些地方的美国海军陆战队以沉重的打击，使敌人惊恐万状。
    美国海军陆战队二日在犹安乡被解放武装力量歼灭三个连、重创两个连和四日、五日被打死打伤近三百名以后，并不甘心失败，六日早晨又先后出动三个连的侵略军在飞机和大炮的掩护下，再次向犹安乡进犯，但很快就遭到解放武装力量的猛烈截击，被歼灭一百五十名，并被击毁击伤坦克六辆。
    在三连美国强盗吃败仗的同时，美国海军陆战队第三团第一营和第三营，也分兵几路，向犹安乡偷偷进犯。这些美国少爷兵个个胆小如鼠，行军速度非常缓慢。
    下午三时半，解放武装力量同时向各股敌军发起猛攻，用重型武器不断轰击美国强盗。各个突击组同炮兵紧密配合，机智灵活地从四面八方冲入敌人阵地，同敌人展开肉搏战。他们把敌人分割成许多小块后，一批一批地消灭。在解放武装力量的沉重打击下，美军死伤惨重，残敌狼狈逃窜。与此同时，解放武装力量还猛烈炮击美军在东河、育庙和昆天的炮兵阵地。
    经过三个小时的英勇战斗，解放武装力量完全控制了敌人阵地，歼灭美国海军陆战队三个连。这样，在六日这天战斗中，广治省解放武装力量取得了歼灭美军近六百人的辉煌战果，其中包括全歼三个连，击毁击伤敌人坦克十三辆，击落敌机一架。（附图片）
