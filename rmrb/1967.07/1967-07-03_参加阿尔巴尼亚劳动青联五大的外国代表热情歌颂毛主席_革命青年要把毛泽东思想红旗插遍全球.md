Foreign youth delegates invited to attend the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Youth League have enthusiastically praised Chairman Mao, the great teacher of the world's proletarian revolution, enthusiastically praised the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the great leader Chairman Mao's personally initiated and led Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, praised the revolutionary feats of the Chinese Red Guards, and hailed the successful explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb.

An Indonesian delegate said: In the era when imperialism is heading towards collapse and socialism is triumphing worldwide, the great Marxist-Leninist Mao Zedong Chairman has faithfully and creatively defended and developed Marxism-Leninism, bringing it to a new stage. Mao Zedong Thought is the highest Marxism-Leninism of our times.

He pointed out: "The experience of countless Indonesian revolutionaries and communists, bought with their lives, has convinced us that Mao Zedong's path is the only correct path for the Indonesian revolution. Following Mao Zedong's path means following the path of armed struggle, which is the path of building a strong and advanced rural base area, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and liberating the country through people's war."

A representative of the Malayan Communist Youth League said: "Comrade Mao Zedong has brilliantly solved a series of theoretical and practical problems regarding the development of the revolution and the prevention of capitalist restoration under the dictatorship of the proletariat, thus bringing Marxism-Leninism to a new stage."

Representatives from Peru, Thailand, and other countries pointed out that in their struggles, they have better understood Chairman Mao's brilliant judgment that "imperialism and all reactionaries are paper tigers," and they expressed their determination to wage armed struggles against U.S. imperialism, old and new colonialism, and their lackeys under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought.

Representatives from France, Portugal, and other countries pointed out that Comrade Mao Zedong is the Lenin of our times.

A Ceylonese representative said that Chairman Mao is the great leader of the peoples of all countries and the red sun in the hearts of all revolutionaries worldwide.

A Peruvian representative pointed out: "In the youth movement, we must grasp and apply the teachings of Comrade Mao Zedong. Only in this way can we become invincible."

Many youth representatives from various countries enthusiastically praised the world-famous Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the loyal fighters of Chairman Mao, the Red Guards.

An Indonesian representative enthusiastically praised the Chinese Red Guards, saying: "The Red Guards are revolutionaries. They dare to think, dare to speak, dare to make revolution, and dare to fight against U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and reactionaries. The brave spirit of the Red Guards is spreading to the youth movements around the world. The Red Guards are the most brilliant examples of revolutionary youth who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, overcome and despise difficulties, and dedicate themselves wholeheartedly to the revolution of their country and the world. We are determined to be completely loyal Red Guards of Mao Zedong Thought."

He concluded by saying, "We should, together with the Chinese youth, Albanian youth, and youth from other countries under the leadership of genuine Marxist-Leninist parties, raise the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought high and plant it all over the globe."

Representatives from Sudan, the Dominican Republic, Malaya, and other countries enthusiastically congratulated the great victories achieved by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. A Malayan representative said: "The great revolutionary leader and teacher Mao Zedong Comrade initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, achieving great victories. This victory not only further consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat in China but also opened a new era for the rise of proletarian revolutions in all countries."

A Sudanese representative said: "The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is an unprecedented great revolution in world history."

Many foreign representatives also enthusiastically hailed the great victory of China's successful explosion of its first hydrogen bomb. A Dominican representative said: "The successful explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb greatly encouraged the peoples of various countries who have taken up arms to fight and bury imperialism." Representatives from Sudan, Malaya, and other countries said that the successful explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb marked a great advance in science and technology by the Chinese people, another new victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, another new victory for the Chinese people and the revolutionary peoples of the world, and another great victory for Mao Zedong Thought.

    他指出：“千万个印度尼西亚革命者和共产党员用生命换来的经验使我们相信，毛泽东的道路是印度尼西亚革命唯一正确的道路。遵循毛泽东的道路就是遵循武装斗争的道路，也就是遵循建立强大的和先进的农村根据地，由农村包围城市，以人民战争来解放全国的道路。”

    印度尼西亚代表热烈赞扬中国红卫兵说：“红卫兵是革命的造反派。他们敢想、敢说、敢革命、敢于向美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和反动派进行斗争。红卫兵的勇敢精神正在扩大到世界青年运动中去。红卫兵是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，战胜和蔑视困难，全心全意为祖国和世界革命服务的革命青年的最光辉的榜样。我们下定决心要做完完全全忠实于毛泽东思想的红卫兵。”
    他最后说，我们应当同中国青年、阿尔巴尼亚青年和其他在真正的马克思列宁主义政党领导下的各国青年一起，把毛泽东思想的红旗高高地插遍全球。

    许多外国代表还热烈欢呼中国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功的伟大胜利。多米尼加代表说：“中国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功，大大鼓舞了拿起武器进行斗争、彻底埋葬帝国主义的各国人民。”苏丹和马来亚等代表说，中国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功，标志着中国人民在科学技术方面取得了巨大的进展，这是无产阶级文化大革命的又一个新胜利，是中国人民和世界各国革命人民的又一个新胜利，是毛泽东思想的又一个伟大胜利。
