The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a revolution that touches the souls of the people. Every revolutionary comrade of the proletariat must not only dare to touch the souls of others but also be brave enough to touch their own souls. At present, when the proletarian revolutionaries are in power, we must pay even more attention to the correct handling of our own issues. That is, we must, as Comrade Lin Biao has pointed out, "be critical of oneself in a dialectical way."

Everything is divisible; everything is twofold. Chairman Mao often emphasizes the universality and absoluteness of contradictions. He pointed out: "The law of the unity of opposites is the fundamental law of the universe. This law is universally present in nature, in human society, and in people's thinking." Today, as the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution develops to the new stage of great criticism and great struggle, every comrade must fully pay attention to the opposing aspects within one's own thoughts, actively engage in ideological struggle, and strive for ideological transformation, thereby promoting one's own progress and the advancement of the revolution.

Is there any comrade whose thoughts and work do not have opposing aspects? Proletarian ideology and bourgeois, petty-bourgeois ideology, materialism and idealism, dialectics and metaphysics, correctness and errors, achievements and shortcomings—these opposing aspects often exist in our minds. Among these opposing aspects, the most fundamental is the contradiction between the bourgeois worldview and the proletarian worldview, the contradiction between "public" and "private."

"Public" and "private" cannot coexist peacefully. Chairman Mao said: "For any particular thing, the unity of opposites is conditional, temporary, transitional, and therefore relative, while the struggle of opposites is absolute." The result of the struggle is the transformation of opposites, one side devouring the other. Therefore, the struggle between the two opposing thoughts is either "public" devouring "private" or "private" devouring "public," with no third way. Similarly, the unity of opposites between materialism and idealism, dialectics and metaphysics, correctness and errors, achievements and shortcomings is no exception.

Some comrades think: "I have a bit of selfishness and impurities, a few shortcomings and errors, what's the big deal!" Of course, generally speaking, we should first see our achievements, see the nine fingers. However, we must be ten times more vigilant about our own shortcomings and errors, see that one finger. Even if there is a speck of "private" dust in one's mind, do not let it go unnoticed, otherwise the contradiction will change to the opposite direction. The struggle between opposing aspects such as "public" and "private" is indeed reflected in the overall transformation of worldviews, but it is accumulated and developed through specific incidents. It is the transformation of many local opposing aspects that ultimately leads to the transformation of the entire worldview. Our goal is to complete the qualitative change from non-proletarian thoughts to proletarian thoughts, so we must fully pay attention to every quantitative change process, and in every specific issue, fiercely combat the "private" element, like fighting a street battle, and break down the "private" strongholds in the mind one by one.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The opposing and struggling sides of a contradiction transform into each other under certain conditions. Here, conditions are important. Without certain conditions, the struggling sides will not transform." Each of us should consciously create conditions to make contradictions transform in a positive direction, while preventing and avoiding conditions that might make contradictions transform in a negative direction. To achieve this, the most fundamental thing is to, in the great waves of class struggle and the practical struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, earnestly study Chairman Mao's great works, earnestly study the theories, lines, principles, and policies of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution proposed by Chairman Mao, and work hard on the transformation of one's subjective world, especially on self-cultivation. At the same time, we must closely connect with the masses, humbly listen to the criticisms of the masses, and conduct strict self-criticism. Only in this way can we temper ourselves into a genuine, thorough proletarian revolutionary.

Lacking a dialectical view of oneself will lead to a loss of self-awareness and blindness. Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must learn to look at problems comprehensively, seeing not only the positive side but also the negative side. Under certain conditions, bad things can lead to good results, and good things can also lead to bad results." Achievements are good things that can inspire us to move forward with more confidence. But if we only see the positive side of our achievements and do not remain vigilant, self-admiring, we will carry the burden of achievements, become arrogant, and fall. Why do some comrades' achievements in work not become the starting point for greater victories but the beginning of errors? The reason lies here.

Being critical of oneself in a dialectical way means not only revolutionizing the objective world but also revolutionizing the subjective world. Comrade Lin Biao instructs us: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. The revolution also requires us to revolutionize ourselves. Without revolutionizing ourselves, the revolution cannot be successful." Here, Comrade Lin Biao raises a top-priority issue for every proletarian revolutionary comrade: to carry the revolution through to the end, we must, while transforming the objective world, consciously transform our subjective world. Some comrades often say they want to "rebel to the end." Where is this end? On one hand, it is to thoroughly overthrow the handful of big and small capitalist-roaders within the Party; on the other hand, it is also to thoroughly cleanse the influence of bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts in our own minds. To "rebel to the end," we must engage in self-revolution. Otherwise, we cannot "rebel to the end."

Contradictions exist universally and forever. Even in a communist society where classes have been eliminated, even after ten thousand years, contradictions will still exist in the minds of each of us, though the nature of these contradictions will be different from now. Therefore, we must still correctly handle ourselves, constantly be critical of ourselves in a dialectical way, fully pay attention to the opposing aspects in our thoughts, and constantly engage in the struggle of "one side devouring the other." This struggle will never end because the changes and movements of the objective reality world will never end, and people's understanding of truth in practice will also never end.

In his brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao teaches us: "The working class must transform the entire society in the struggle against classes and in the struggle against nature, and at the same time, transform itself. The working class must constantly learn in work, gradually overcome its shortcomings, and never stop." At present, every proletarian revolutionary comrade must more firmly remember Chairman Mao's great teachings, constantly be critical of oneself in a dialectical way, constantly transform one's worldview, and revolutionize and advance forever.

    对自己要一分为二
    ——学习《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》

    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命。每一个无产阶级革命派战士，不仅要敢于触及别人的灵魂，也要勇于触及自己的灵魂。在当前，无产阶级革命派掌权的情况下，我们一定要更加重视正确对待自己的问题。这就是，必须象林彪同志所指出的那样，对自己“应该一分为二”。
    任何事物都是可分的，都是一分为二。毛主席经常向我们强调矛盾的普遍性和绝对性。他指出：“马克思主义的哲学认为，对立统一规律是宇宙的根本规律。这个规律，不论在自然界、人类社会和人们的思想中，都是普遍存在的。矛盾着的对立面又统一，又斗争，由此推动事物的运动和变化。”
    今天，无产阶级文化大革命发展到革命的大批判、大斗争的新阶段，我们每一个同志都必须充分重视自己思想中的对立面，积极开展思想斗争，努力进行思想改造，从而推动自己进步，推动革命前进。
    我们哪一个同志的思想和工作中没有对立面呢？无产阶级思想和资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，唯物主义和唯心主义，辩证法和形而上学，正确和谬误，成绩和缺点等等，这些对立面常常存在于我们的头脑里。这些对立面中，最根本的是资产阶级世界观和无产阶级世界观的矛盾，是“公”和“私”的矛盾。
    “公”和“私”是不能和平共处的。毛主席说：“对于任何一个具体的事物说来，对立的统一是有条件的、暂时的、过渡的，因而是相对的，对立的斗争则是绝对的。”斗争的结果是对立面的转化，是“一个吃掉一个”。因而，两种对立思想的斗争，不是“公”吃掉“私”，就是“私”吃掉“公”，没有第三条路。同样，唯物主义和唯心主义，辩证法和形而上学，正确和谬误，成绩和缺点的对立统一，也莫不如此。
    有的同志认为：“我有这么点私心杂念，有这么点缺点错误，有什么了不起！”当然，从总的来说，应当首先看到我们的成绩，看到九个指头。但是，我们自己必须比别人十倍地重视自己的缺点错误，看到那一个指头。即使自己头脑中有一点“私”字的灰尘，也不要轻易放过，否则矛盾就会向相反的方向起变化。“公”和“私”等矛盾对立面的斗争，固然表现在整个世界观的转变上，但它却是通过一件件具体的事情，积累和发展起来的。正是许多局部的对立面的转化，才最终形成整个世界观的转变。我们的目的是完成从非无产阶级思想到无产阶级思想的质变，那就必须充分重视每一个量变的过程，必须在每一个具体问题上狠斗“私”字，象打巷战似的，把头脑中“私”字的阵地一个一个地攻破。
    毛主席教导我们：“矛盾着的对立的双方互相斗争的结果，无不在一定条件下互相转化。在这里，条件是重要的。没有一定的条件，斗争着的双方都不会转化。”
    我们每一个同志，都应当自觉地去创造条件，使矛盾向好的方面转化，同时防止和避免那些可能使矛盾向坏的方面转化的条件。要做到这一点，最根本的，就是要在阶级斗争的大风浪中，在无产阶级文化大革命的斗争实践中，认真学习毛主席的伟大著作，认真学习毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，在用字上，特别是在自己主观世界的改造上狠下功夫。同时，必须密切联系群众，虚心听取群众的批评，并进行严格的自我批评。只有这样，才能把自己锻炼成为一个真正的彻底的无产阶级革命派。
    对自己缺乏一分为二的观点，就会失去自觉性，产生盲目性。毛主席教导我们说：“我们必须学会全面地看问题，不但要看到事物的正面，也要看到它的反面。在一定的条件下，坏的东西可以引出好的结果，好的东西也可以引出坏的结果。”成绩这个东西，本来是好的，它可以鼓舞我们更有信心地前进。但如果只看到自己有成绩的一面，不加警惕，自我欣赏，就会背上成绩的包袱，飘飘然起来，就会栽跟斗。为什么有的同志工作中获得的成绩没有成为取得更大胜利的起点，却成了错误的开始，原因就在这里。
    对自己一分为二，就是既要革客观世界的命，也要革主观世界的命。林彪同志指示我们：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”林彪同志在这里向我们每一个无产阶级革命派战士提出了一个头等重要的问题：要将革命进行到底，就必须在改造客观世界的同时，自觉地改造自己的主观世界。有的同志常常说要“造反到底”，这个底在哪里？这个底，一方面是要彻底打倒党内一小撮大大小小走资本主义道路当权派；另一方面，也是要在我们自己的头脑中彻底肃清资产阶级、小资产阶级思想的影响。要“造反到底”，就要自我革命。否则，就不可能“造反到底”。
    矛盾是普遍地、永远地存在的。即使到了已经消灭了阶级的共产主义社会，到了一万年之后，在我们每一个人的思想中也仍然存在着矛盾，只不过矛盾的性质同现在有所不同罢了。因而仍然需要正确地对待自己，不断地对自己一分为二，充分重视自己思想中的对立面，不断地进行“一个吃掉一个”的斗争。这个斗争是永远也不会完结的，因为客观现实世界的变化和运动永远没有完结，人们在实践中对于真理的认识也就永远没有完结。
    毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这一光辉著作中教导我们说：“工人阶级要在阶级斗争中和向自然界的斗争中改造整个社会，同时也就改造自己。工人阶级必须在工作中不断学习，逐步克服自己的缺点，永远也不能停止。”在当前，我们每一个无产阶级革命派战士，都必须更加牢记毛主席的这一伟大教导，不断地对自己一分为二，不断改造自己的世界观，不断革命，永远前进。
