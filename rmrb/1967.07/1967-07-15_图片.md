On the night of July 11th to the morning of the 12th, the Hong Kong patriotic organization, Wah Fung Chinese Goods Company, was subjected to an armed attack by the British colonial fascist authorities. The employees of this company bravely fought back, engaging the enemy for thirteen hours, thwarting the enemy's plot. This is a photo of them studying Chairman Mao's Quotations after their victory in this struggle, preparing to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher and to throw themselves into new battles.
