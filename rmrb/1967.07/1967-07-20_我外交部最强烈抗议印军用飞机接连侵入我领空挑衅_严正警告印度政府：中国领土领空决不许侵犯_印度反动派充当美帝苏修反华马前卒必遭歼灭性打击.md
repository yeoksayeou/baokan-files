The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a strong protest on July 19 to the Indian Embassy in China regarding the serious incident of Indian military aircraft repeatedly invading Chinese airspace from July 12 to July 17, conducting provocative actions. The note emphasized that the Chinese government sternly warns the Indian government: The sacred territory and airspace of the People's Republic of China are inviolable. The Indian government's serious provocations, carried out under the instructions of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists, will inevitably face annihilating blows from the Chinese people and the People's Liberation Army defending our borders.

The note states that from July 12 to July 17, 1967, Indian military aircraft invaded Chinese airspace in Xinjiang and Tibet a total of 16 times, conducting provocative actions. The specific facts are as follows:

1. On July 12 at 14:50, an Indian aircraft invaded the airspace over the Bangong Lake and Spangur Lake regions in Tibet, conducting reconnaissance and provocations over the Spangur Civil Affairs Inspection Station in China, then flew east to the Yitu and Shanhe areas, penetrating approximately 100 kilometers into Chinese territory;

2. On July 12 at 15:00, an Indian aircraft invaded the airspace over the Qipanqiapu River Valley in Xinjiang, conducting reconnaissance over the Tianwen Point Civil Affairs Inspection Station in China, then flew east to the Qipanqiapu Pass area;

3. On July 12 at 15:12, an Indian aircraft invaded the airspace over the Hetian Beach area in Xinjiang, then flew to the north bank of the Galwan River area, conducting reconnaissance and harassment;

4. On July 12 at 15:15, an Indian aircraft invaded the airspace over the Bangong Lake region in Tibet;

5. On July 12 at 15:25, an Indian aircraft invaded the airspace over the Wenquan Civil Affairs Inspection Station, Kotar Village, and Banlong in China, repeatedly circling and conducting long-term reconnaissance and harassment, exiting the territory at 15:50;

6. On July 12 at 16:05, an Indian aircraft invaded from the Kongka Pass, then flew east to the Lhanak Pass area, conducting reconnaissance, penetrating approximately 60 kilometers into Chinese territory;

7. On July 12 at 16:25, an Indian aircraft invaded the airspace over the south bank of the Spangur Lake region in Tibet, circling and conducting reconnaissance;

8. On July 13 at 15:45, an Indian aircraft invaded the airspace over the Zaxigang and Gar Kunsha areas in Tibet, circling and conducting reconnaissance and provocations, penetrating approximately 80 kilometers into Chinese territory;

9. On July 13 at 16:30, an Indian aircraft invaded the airspace over the Sanggang and its northeastern regions in Tibet, circling and conducting reconnaissance;

10. On July 13 at 17:10, an Indian aircraft invaded the airspace over the Bolin and Toling regions in Tibet, circling and conducting reconnaissance, penetrating approximately 90 kilometers into Chinese territory;

11. On July 15 at 12:35, an Indian aircraft invaded the Qipanqiapu River Valley in Xinjiang, repeatedly circling over the Tianwen Point Civil Affairs Inspection Station in China, conducting provocations;

12. On July 15 at 13:00, an Indian aircraft invaded the airspace over the Hetian Beach and its eastern regions in Xinjiang, conducting reconnaissance;

13. On July 15 at 13:15, an Indian aircraft invaded the airspace over the Spangur Lake region in Tibet, conducting reconnaissance and provocations;

14. On July 15 at 13:30, an Indian aircraft invaded the airspace over the Sanggang and its northeastern regions in Tibet;

15. On July 15 at 13:55, an Indian aircraft invaded the airspace over the Bolin and Toling regions in Tibet, repeatedly circling over the Bolin Civil Affairs Inspection Station in China, conducting harassment;

16. On July 17 at 16:00, an Indian aircraft invaded the airspace over the Qipanqiapu River Valley and Dapsang Plain in Xinjiang, conducting reconnaissance.

Regarding the above-mentioned serious incidents of Indian aircraft invading Chinese airspace, the Chinese government lodges the strongest protest with the Indian government.

The note points out that since this year, Indian troops have continued their incursions and provocations along the Sino-Indian and Sino-Bhutan borders. Now, the Indian government has even more brazenly dispatched aircraft, invading Chinese airspace 16 times in a few days, conducting military provocations along the entire central and western sections of the Sino-Indian border, deliberately creating border tensions. This is not accidental. It is the Indian government, acting as a lackey of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, orchestrating another anti-China event after planning the fascist atrocity of attacking the Chinese Embassy in India and injuring Chinese diplomatic personnel. This is another serious provocation against the Chinese people and the Chinese government.

The note concludes that the more frantically the Indian government acts against China, the faster it will hasten its own doom. The Indian government must immediately stop these military provocations. If it persists, it will have to bear all the consequences that follow.

    我外交部最强烈抗议印军用飞机接连侵入我领空挑衅
    严正警告印度政府：中国领土领空决不许侵犯
    印度反动派充当美帝苏修反华马前卒必遭歼灭性打击
    新华社十九日讯　中华人民共和国外交部十九日照会印度驻华大使馆，就印度军用飞机七月十二日至十七日连续十六架次侵入中国领空，进行猖狂挑衅的严重事件，向印度政府提出最强烈的抗议。照会强调说，中国政府严正警告印度政府：中华人民共和国的神圣领土、领空，决不许侵犯。印度政府秉承美帝苏修意旨进行的严重挑衅，必将受到我国人民和保卫我国边疆的人民解放军的歼灭性的打击。
    照会说，一九六七年七月十二日至十七日，印度军用飞机十六架次侵入中国新疆和西藏广大地区上空，进行猖狂挑衅。具体事实如下：
    一、七月十二日十四时五十分，印度飞机一架侵入西藏班公湖和斯潘古尔湖地区，在中国斯潘古尔民政检查站上空进行侦察挑衅，以后又向东窜扰到日土、善和等地，深入中国境内约一百公里；
    二、七月十二日十五时，印度飞机一架侵入新疆奇普恰普河谷地带，在中国天文点民政检查站上空进行侦察，然后又向东飞至奇普恰普山口一带活动；
    三、七月十二日十五时十二分，印度飞机一架侵入新疆河尾滩地区上空，以后又飞到加勒万河北岸地区上空进行侦察骚扰；
    四、七月十二日十五时十五分，印度飞机一架侵入西藏班公湖地区上空；
    五、七月十二日十五时二十五分，印度飞机一架侵入中国温泉民政检查站、科塔村、班隆等地上空反复盘旋，进行长时间的侦察骚扰，至十五时五十分才出境；
    六、七月十二日十六时五分，印度飞机一架从空喀山口入侵，然后往东窜扰至拉那克山口一带上空进行侦察，深入中国境内约六十公里；
    七、七月十二日十六时二十五分，印度飞机一架侵入西藏斯潘古尔湖南岸地区上空盘旋侦察；
    八、七月十三日十五时四十五分，印度飞机一架侵入西藏扎西岗和噶尔昆沙等地上空盘旋，进行侦察挑衅，深入中国境内约八十公里；
    九、七月十三日十六时三十分，印度飞机一架侵入西藏三岗及其东北广大地区上空盘旋侦察；
    十、七月十三日十七时十分，印度飞机一架侵入西藏波林和托林地区上空盘旋侦察，深入中国境内约九十公里；
    十一、七月十五日十二时三十五分，印度飞机一架侵入新疆奇普恰普河谷地带活动，并在中国天文点民政检查站上空反复盘旋，进行挑衅；
    十二、七月十五日十三时，印度飞机一架侵入新疆河尾滩及其以东地区上空进行侦察；
    十三、七月十五日十三时十五分，印度飞机一架侵入西藏斯潘古尔湖地区上空进行侦察挑衅；
    十四、七月十五日十三时三十分，印度飞机一架侵入西藏三岗及其东北地区上空活动；
    十五、七月十五日十三时五十五分，印度飞机一架侵入西藏波林和托林地区上空，并在中国波林民政检查站上空反复盘旋，进行骚扰；
    十六、七月十七日十六时，印度飞机一架侵入新疆奇普恰普河谷地带和达普桑平地上空进行侦察。
    对于上述印度飞机侵入中国领空的严重事件，中国政府向印度政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    照会指出，今年以来，印度军队在中印、中锡边境的入侵挑衅活动一直未断。现在印度政府又更加猖狂地派遣飞机，在几天内连续十六次侵入中国领空，在整个中印边界中、西段进行军事挑衅，蓄意制造边境紧张局势。这绝不是偶然的。这是印度政府充当美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义反华的马前卒，在一手策划了袭击中国驻印度大使馆、打伤中国外交人员的法西斯暴行以后制造的又一反华事件。这是对中国人民和中国政府的又一次严重挑衅。
    照会最后说，印度政府越是疯狂反华，就越将加速自己的灭亡。印度政府必须立即停止这种军事挑衅，如果一意孤行，就必须承担由此而产生的一切后果。
