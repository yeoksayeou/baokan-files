Under the boundless radiance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Shandong Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Headquarters, Shandong Red Guards Headquarters, Shandong Red Guards Art Revolution Rebel Command, and all brother revolutionary mass organizations have, in the fierce class struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, stood together through storms and battles, forged deep revolutionary friendships. After the "February 3" seizure of power, under the leadership of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, we have continued to stand together, fight together, and achieve victory together.

Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our province is developing in depth, and the situation is excellent. However, the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads has not ended but is continuing fiercely and sharply in the new situation. The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and those with ulterior motives are fanning the flames and stirring up trouble, either from the right or the ultra-"left" side, attempting to sow discord, stir up trouble, and weaken and sabotage the dictatorship of the proletariat, aiming to restore capitalism. Therefore, we must, under the great banner of Mao Zedong Thought and on the basis of Mao Zedong's proletarian revolutionary line, further strengthen our unity and jointly fight the enemy. This is a requirement of the situation, a requirement of the revolution, a requirement for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and a requirement for preventing the restoration of capitalism.

The struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads in society will inevitably be reflected within our revolutionary ranks. The small-bourgeois ideology that is currently growing is a reflection of this struggle. It is a corrosive agent that will disperse our unity, cause disagreements, and weaken our fighting spirit. We must better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, seriously carry out rectification, and guide the small-bourgeois ideology within our ranks onto the track of proletarian revolution.

All words and actions of the proletarian revolutionary masses must be measured against Mao Zedong Thought. This is our highest principle. Whatever is in line with Mao Zedong Thought, we support and implement; whatever is not in line with Mao Zedong Thought, we resist and oppose. We must always adhere to this principle and never violate it.

To this end, the following decisions are made:

(1) We must strictly follow Chairman Mao's great teachings and educate our subordinate organizations and all fighters on the following points: (1) Strengthen revolutionary unity within the ranks based on Mao Zedong Thought. Speak words that benefit this unity and firmly refrain from speaking words that harm it; do things that benefit this unity and firmly refrain from doing things that harm it. (2) "Consider the overall situation" and "subordinate the part to the whole," firmly oppose factionalism, small-groupism, and localism. (3) Strengthen revolutionary spirit, scientific approach, and organizational discipline, firmly oppose subjectivism, liberalism, anarchism, and individualism.

(2) Starting from the three headquarters, down to our subordinate organizations and all fighters, we must strengthen unity and contact with brother revolutionary mass organizations. Revolutionary mass organizations, regardless of size, each have their strengths and weaknesses and should learn from each other and fight shoulder to shoulder.

(3) Effective immediately, except for those specially permitted by the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, all fighters of the Shandong Red Guards Headquarters must return to school to study and make revolution, and all fighters of the Shandong Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Headquarters and Shandong Red Guards Art Revolution Rebel Command must return to their production and work posts. In their respective units, they should carry out extensive criticism, promote the great alliance of revolutionary masses and the "three-in-one combination," and improve production and work. In the future, without the approval of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, they are not allowed to leave their units to participate in the Cultural Revolution in other units.

(4) We must firmly implement the Central Committee's instructions on achieving a great alliance of revolutionary masses by unit and by department. In units and departments where revolutionary masses are in the majority, we should actively carry out ideological and political work, gradually, cautiously, and from the bottom up, achieve unified leadership. In a unit or department where the three headquarters or two headquarters are simultaneously developing grassroots organizations, we should negotiate and promote a great alliance, placing it under the management of one headquarters.

(5) The relationship between the Shandong Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Headquarters, Shandong Red Guards Headquarters, and Shandong Red Guards Art Revolution Rebel Command and their respective subordinate organizations should emphasize both vertical and horizontal leadership, gradually transitioning to horizontal leadership as the main focus. In the future, the three headquarters should mainly strengthen ideological and political leadership over their subordinate organizations and avoid excessive interference in their specific operations.

(6) For major issues that may cause disagreements among us, the three headquarters should not make unilateral statements lightly. When statements are necessary, we should actively contact each other, reach a unified understanding, and then take action to avoid being used by bad elements.

(7) If subordinate organizations of the three headquarters have disagreements and friction, each headquarters must, with a spirit of self-criticism, seriously conduct self-criticism, understand each other, and jointly seek correct solutions. Absolutely no armed struggle is allowed, and we should not do things that cause pain to friends and joy to enemies. If such things happen, both sides should take a high stance and actively resolve the issue.

(8) If subordinate organizations and fighters of the three headquarters have different opinions, they should raise them through their own organizations or exchange views face-to-face and not spread sentiments harmful to unity behind their backs. Even more, they should not engage in "backdoor" activities.

(9) To continuously strengthen unity and solve some urgent problems that need to be addressed together, under the leadership of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, the three headquarters should hold a joint meeting every two months (except for urgent important issues that need to be addressed). At the same time, the three headquarters should establish a joint office to handle specific issues in their relationships.

(10) This decision must be strictly implemented by all fighters of the Shandong Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Headquarters, Shandong Red Guards Headquarters, and Shandong Red Guards Art Revolution Rebel Command, and a comprehensive review should be conducted every two months.

We sincerely hope that other brother revolutionary mass organizations will supervise and help us implement this decision and suggest that all brother revolutionary mass organizations refer to this decision to strengthen the revolutionary fighting unity among all brother revolutionary mass organizations.

    关于进一步加强团结共同对敌的决定
    （一九六七年七月十二日联席会议通过）
    在光焰无际的毛泽东思想照耀下，我们山东革命工人造反总指挥部、红卫兵山东指挥部、红卫兵山东文艺革命造反司令部及所有兄弟的革命群众组织，在同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的激烈的阶级搏斗中，风雨同舟，并肩战斗，结成了深厚的革命友谊。“二·三”夺权后，我们在山东省革命委员会的领导下，也一直是团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    目前，我省的无产阶级文化大革命正在向纵深发展，形势很好。但是，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争并没有结束，而是在新的形势下继续尖锐、激烈地进行着。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和别有用心的人，正在煽阴风，点邪火，从右的方面或者从极“左”的方面，挑拨离间，兴风作浪，妄图削弱和破坏无产阶级专政，实行资本主义复辟。因此，我们必须在毛泽东思想的伟大旗帜下，在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的基础上，进一步加强团结，共同对敌。这是形势的需要，是革命的需要，是巩固无产阶级专政的需要，是防止资本主义复辟的需要。
    社会上两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，必然反映到我们革命队伍的内部来。目前，正在滋长的小资产阶级的思潮，就是这种斗争的反映。这是一种腐蚀剂，会使我们的团结涣散，意见分歧，斗志松懈。我们必须更好地活学活用毛主席著作，认真地进行整风，把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道上来。
    我们无产阶级革命派的一切言论和行动，必须以毛泽东思想为标准。这是我们的最高原则。凡是符合毛泽东思想的，就拥护，就照办；凡是不符合毛泽东思想的，就抵制，就反对。我们必须永远坚持这个原则，而绝不能违反这个原则。
    为此，特作如下决定：
    （一）要紧紧遵循毛主席的伟大教导，对自己的下属组织和全体战士抓紧下列内容的教育：（1）加强革命队伍内部的在毛泽东思想基础上的革命团结。有利于这种团结的话就说，不利于这种团结的话就坚决不说；有利于这种团结的事就做，不利于这种团结的事就坚决不做。（2）“照顾全局”“以局部服从全局”，坚决反对山头主义、小团体主义和本位主义。（3）加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，坚决反对主观主义、自由主义、无政府主义和个人主义。
    （二）从我们三个总部开始，直至自己的下属组织和全体战士，都要加强同兄弟的革命群众组织的团结和联系。革命的群众组织不论大小，都各有自己的长处和短处，应该互相学习，并肩战斗。
    （三）自即日起，除经省革命委员会特许的以外，红卫兵山东指挥部的全体战士必须无例外地回校复课闹革命，山东革命工人造反总指挥部和红卫兵山东文艺革命造反司令部的全体战士，都必须无例外地回到自己的生产和工作岗位。在本单位开展大批判，搞好斗批改，促进革命派的大联合和“三结合”，搞好生产和工作。今后非经省革命委员会批准，不准离开本单位去参与其他单位的文化大革命。
    （四）要坚决执行中央关于按单位、按部门实行革命的大联合的指示，在革命派占优势的单位和部门，要积极进行思想政治工作，逐步地、慎重地、自下而上地实行归口联合。在一个单位和部门，我们三个总部或两个总部在那里同时发展基层组织的，要经过协商，促其实现大联合，划归一个总部管理。
    （五）山东革命工人造反总指挥部、红卫兵山东指挥部和红卫兵山东文艺革命造反司令部同各自的下属组织的关系，既要重视条条领导，又要加强块块领导，逐步过渡到以块块为主。今后，三个总部对于各自的下属组织，主要是加强思想政治领导，不要去过多地干预他们的具体业务。
    （六）对于某些可能引起我们之间的分歧的重大事情，三个总部都不要单方的轻易表态。必须表态时，要互相主动联系，取得统一认识后，再采取行动，以免被坏人利用。
    （七）三个总部的下属组织，如果相互之间发生了分歧和磨擦，各自的总部都必须本着严以责己的精神，认真地进行自我批评，互相体谅、共同协商，寻求正确的解决措施。绝对不准武斗，不要做那种使亲者痛，仇者快的事情。如果发生那种事情，互相都要采取高姿态，积极主动地加以解决。
    （八）三个总部的下属组织和战士，如果相互之间有不同看法，应该通过自己的组织提出，或者当面交换意见，不准背后散布有碍团结的情绪，更不准背后搞“小动作”。
    （九）为了不断地增强团结，解决一些需要共同解决的迫切问题，在山东省革命委员会的领导下，三个总部每两个月召开一次联席会议（有急需解决的重要问题例外）。同时，三个总部建立一个联合办公室，负责处理相互关系中的具体问题。
    （十）本决定，山东革命工人造反总指挥部、红卫兵山东指挥部、红卫兵山东文艺革命造反司令部的全体战士，都必须坚决贯彻执行，并且每两个月进行一次普遍的检查。
    恳切希望其他兄弟的革命群众组织监督和帮助我们对本决定的执行，并建议各兄弟的革命群众组织，参考这个决定，加强所有兄弟的革命群众组织之间的革命的战斗团结。
