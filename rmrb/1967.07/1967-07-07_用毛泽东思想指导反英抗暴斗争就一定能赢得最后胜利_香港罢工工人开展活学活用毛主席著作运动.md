	Hong Kong striking workers launch a campaign to study and apply Chairman Mao's works

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 6th: The brave workers of various industries in Hong Kong, who are engaged in a united general strike, are gradually launching a mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in conjunction with the various practical issues of the anti-British struggle. The workers say: Chairman Mao's works are the highest directives for the anti-oppression struggle. Every word of Chairman Mao is the truth. As long as we follow Chairman Mao's directives, we will surely win the final victory in the anti-British struggle.

	The workers at the Taikoo Dockyard have fully launched activities to study Chairman Mao's works. Recently, the workers have focused on studying Chairman Mao's teachings on the nature of imperialism and the mass line, in order to further raise their awareness and arm themselves. After studying, the workers' hearts are more united, their courage is greater, and their hatred, contempt, and disdain for British imperialism are even stronger. They are determined to organize themselves according to Chairman Mao's teachings and engage in a head-on struggle with the paper tiger of British imperialism.

	The milk workers also study Chairman Mao's works in groups by region. Every day, they study one or two of Chairman Mao's quotations in conjunction with the international and domestic situation and the situation of the anti-British struggle in Hong Kong. In recent days, in response to the British capitalists' plot to threaten and bribe by canceling the "retirement benefits," they studied Chairman Mao's quotation: "We must have a clear head, which includes not believing the 'nice words' of imperialism and not being afraid of imperialism's threats." The workers' stance is more firm, and their fighting spirit is more ardent. Many old workers in the ice-making department, cold storage department, machinery department, and milk delivery department of the dairy factory have expressed: To defend Mao Zedong Thought and to uphold national dignity, no amount of enemy threats can stop us from continuing the strike struggle.

	The gas workers study Chairman Mao's quotations at the union every evening. Through studying, the workers further recognize the reactionary nature of British imperialism and are determined to organize a vast anti-violence army to launch continuous and fierce attacks on British imperialism.

	The postal workers have also recently launched a comprehensive campaign to study Chairman Mao's works. They are divided into several small groups and study Chairman Mao's quotations at the union every day.

	Workers from Hong Kong's maritime, warehousing, public transportation, cross-harbor ferries, and other British colonial institutions who are participating in the strike have also recently initiated mass campaigns to study Chairman Mao's works. They have expressed: We must follow the directives of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, master Mao Zedong Thought, and smash British imperialism to smithereens.

　　香港罢工工人开展活学活用毛主席著作运动
    据新华社香港六日电  英勇地进行联合大罢工斗争的香港各业工人，正在结合反英抗暴斗争的各种实际问题，逐步展开一个活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。工人们说：毛主席著作是反迫害斗争的最高指示，毛主席的话句句是真理，只要遵循毛主席的指示去做，我们就一定能赢得反英抗暴斗争的最后胜利。
    太古船坞工人已全面展开学习毛主席著作的活动。最近，工人们着重学习了毛主席关于帝国主义本性和关于群众路线的论述，以便进一步提高认识，武装自己。经过学习，工人们心更齐，胆更壮，对英帝国主义更加仇视、鄙视、蔑视，决心按照毛主席的教导，组织起来，同英帝国主义纸老虎进行针锋相对的斗争。
    牛奶工人也分地区分小组进行毛主席著作的学习。他们每天都结合国际国内形势和香港抗暴斗争的形势，学一两条毛主席语录。最近几天，他们针对英国资本家以取消“退休金”进行威胁和利诱的阴谋，学习了毛主席语录：“我们要有清醒的头脑，这里包括不相信帝国主义的‘好话’和不害怕帝国主义的恐吓。”工人们的立场更坚定，斗志更昂扬。牛奶厂制冰部、冷房部、机器部和送奶部的许多老工人都表示：为了保卫毛泽东思想，为了维护民族尊严，敌人的任何恐吓，都不能阻止我们把罢工斗争坚持下去。
    煤气工人每天晚上都到工会学习毛主席语录。工人们通过学习，进一步认清英帝国主义的反动本质，决心组织起浩浩荡荡的抗暴大军，向英帝国主义不断进行猛烈的冲击。
    邮务工人最近也全面展开毛主席著作学习活动。他们分了几个小组，每天都到工会坚持学习毛主席语录。
    香港海运、仓库、公共交通、渡海轮船以及其他港英机构参加罢工的工人，最近也陆续开展了群众性的学习毛主席著作活动。他们表示：一定要按照林彪副主席的指示，活学活用毛主席著作，把毛泽东思想学到手，把英帝国主义砸得粉身碎骨。
