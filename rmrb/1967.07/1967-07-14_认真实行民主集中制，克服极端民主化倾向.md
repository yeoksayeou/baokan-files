Currently, it is of great significance for us, the revolutionary cadres and the revolutionary masses, to study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" in conjunction with the actual struggle.

Chairman Mao teaches us to implement dictatorship over the enemy and democracy within the people. The democratic centralism within the people is based on broad democracy. As Chairman Mao pointed out, "Our socialist democracy is the most extensive democracy that any bourgeois state cannot have." This Cultural Revolution, under Chairman Mao's personal command, has fully implemented proletarian democracy, truly mobilizing hundreds of millions of people. Under the guidance of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, the revolutionary masses have formed a vast army of cultural revolutionaries, using the weapons of great debate, big-character posters, and big discussions to launch a sweeping attack and advance on the capitalist-roaders within the Party and their reactionary bourgeois line. Under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, facing such enemies as the capitalist-roaders within the Party, small democracy is not enough, medium democracy is not enough, we must use big democracy, we must boldly mobilize the masses, completely trust and rely on the masses, in order to most thoroughly expose the enemy and most thoroughly defeat the enemy. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party is most afraid of big democracy. In the past, he used the most reactionary slave mentality to suppress the revolutionary spirit of the broad masses of Party members, cadres, and the people; during the Cultural Revolution, he concocted a bourgeois reactionary line to suppress democracy and oppress the masses. He completely destroyed the Party's democratic centralism; he practiced fascist centralism and bourgeois dictatorship. Proletarian big democracy has shattered the counter-revolutionary dictatorship practiced by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and has made them sink into the vast sea of revolutionary masses, meeting their doom. Proletarian big democracy is truly wonderful! We cheer for it!

However, the big democracy we implement is big democracy under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, it is big democracy under centralized guidance, it is absolutely not anarchism, it is absolutely not extreme democratization. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Within the people, democracy is relative to centralism, freedom is relative to discipline. These are two contradictory aspects of a single entity, they are contradictory and yet unified. We should not emphasize one aspect while negating the other. Within the people, there must be no freedom without discipline, and there must be no democracy without centralism. This unity of democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline, is our democratic centralism." Chairman Mao's views on democratic centralism are dialectical materialist views, they are the worldview of the proletariat. The views of anarchism and extreme democratization negate the necessity of centralism and discipline, they are bourgeois idealist metaphysics. These two are fundamentally opposed. The biggest handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, after the failure of slave mentality, used the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology existing in the revolutionary ranks to spread the anarchist reactionary views of doubting everything, negating everything, and overthrowing everything, attempting to make big democracy deviate from the proletarian track and take the path of destroying proletarian dictatorship. Slave mentality and anarchism, although they appear to be two opposite extremes, are actually both enemies of democratic centralism. We must fight on two fronts, fully defend Chairman Mao's correct principles of democratic centralism, and defend proletarian big democracy.

Now, some people misinterpret proletarian big democracy, thinking that big democracy is "absolute democracy," "absolute freedom," it is "doing whatever one wants," regardless of whether it is correct or not, as long as it does not suit their personal or small group's intentions, they oppose it. They recite Chairman Mao's quotations with their mouths, but in action, they do not follow Chairman Mao's instructions. They recite Chairman Mao's quotations for others to hear, but they have no restraint on themselves. They ignore the revolutionary "three-in-one" temporary power organs born in the blazing fire of the Cultural Revolution, they ignore the laws and disciplines established by the proletarian power organs to maintain revolutionary interests, they ignore the new order of the proletarian revolution. Some people even go so far as to destroy these laws, disciplines, and orders. This is a very bad tendency of petty-bourgeois extreme democratization, it is completely against Mao Zedong Thought. Extreme democratization destroys democratic centralism, corrupts the revolutionary ranks, hinders the consolidation of proletarian dictatorship, and actually helps the bourgeoisie oppose the proletariat. Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "The danger of extreme democratization lies in damaging and even completely destroying the Party's organization, weakening and even completely annihilating the Party's fighting capacity, making the Party unable to bear the responsibility of struggle, thereby causing the failure of the revolution."

Those who create chaos with extreme democratization regard democracy as a goal and confuse proletarian big democracy with bourgeois liberalization. Chairman Mao clearly points out in "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People": "Democracy is sometimes seemingly a goal, but in reality, it is only a means." He also says, "In the world, there is only concrete freedom, concrete democracy, there is no abstract freedom, abstract democracy." According to Chairman Mao's teachings, we should conduct a concrete class analysis of democracy, centralism, freedom, and discipline. The essence of this Cultural Revolution is the struggle between the proletariat to consolidate proletarian dictatorship and the bourgeoisie to overthrow proletarian dictatorship. Implementing proletarian big democracy is completely to more powerfully smash the bourgeoisie's restoration plot and to consolidate proletarian dictatorship. In any sense, it does not allow itself to be opposed to proletarian dictatorship. If there is a kind of "democracy" that can be used to weaken and destroy proletarian dictatorship, then it is definitely not proletarian democracy, but definitely bourgeois democracy. Under the current conditions where the proletarian revolutionaries are in power, the capitalist-roaders within the Party, in their desperate struggle, are using every means to exploit the weaknesses in our ranks. They most hope that the proletarian ranks fall into disarray and chaos, they most hope that the proletarian dictatorship organs are weak and powerless, even paralyzed, so that they can return to power. Therefore, anarchism and extreme democratization have become their effective assistants in their counterattack against the proletariat. We must not abstractly think that all "democracy" and "freedom" are good, and all "centralism" and "discipline" are bad. Each class has its own democracy and freedom, and at the same time, it also has its own centralism and discipline. The question is which class's democracy and which class's centralism. Proletarian big democracy is good because it is to "disorder" the revisionist old order. Bourgeois liberalization is bad because it is to "disorder" the proletarian new order. Revisionist discipline must be smashed, proletarian discipline must be followed, this is our clear stance and attitude.

The ideological basis of anarchism and extreme democratization is bourgeois individualism. Those who like to create anarchism also like to create slave mentality. They use "demanding big democracy" as an excuse to resist the correct leadership of the revolution from above, but to the masses below, in the scope they control, they often do not give the masses true democracy. They cannot tolerate different opinions, they fear the masses, they fear the masses speaking out, they fear the masses criticizing, they do not admit their own mistakes, and they fear the masses pointing them out, they are like tigers whose butts cannot be touched. There is no democratic atmosphere there, only blind obedience. Their so-called "demanding democracy" is only for themselves, not for the masses. Therefore, those who create the most anarchism are often those who create the most individualism and factionalism. They are not against organization and discipline, they are only against proletarian organization and discipline, and they want the organization and discipline of small groups. If anyone slightly goes against their will, they immediately criticize, punish, or even expel. Therefore, in places where anarchism is rampant, there is neither correct centralism nor true democracy. Everyone knows that in the past, the head of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique in Beijing, Peng Zhen, created anarchism against the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, making Beijing an independent kingdom where even a needle could not be inserted or water splashed in, while he practiced despotic rule over the masses below in a feudal patriarchal manner. We should draw necessary lessons from this negative example.

Proletarian democracy must definitely be led democracy, proletarian big democracy can only be implemented under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship. Anarchism and extreme democratization not only destroy proletarian dictatorship but also directly destroy proletarian big democracy. The proletarian big democracy implemented in this Cultural Revolution is carried out under highly centralized guidance. This high centralism is Mao Zedong Thought, it is the absolute authority of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. The entire movement has developed according to Chairman Mao's brilliant deployment and the course he pointed out. Without Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, without the "May 16 Notice," without the "Sixteen Points," the broad revolutionary masses would not only not be able to obtain the democracy to expose and criticize the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, they would not be able to obtain the freedom to carry out the "four bigs" (speaking out, airing views, big-character posters, and big debates), but they would necessarily suffer persecution from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. As for seizing power and using power, that would be even more out of the question. Without centralism, there is no democracy; without discipline, there is no freedom. The so-called centralism is to concentrate the correct opinions of the masses on the basis of fully carrying out democracy, summarize experiences, and then go back to the masses. It is to unify understanding, policies, plans, and actions after concentrating the correct opinions of the masses. Without such centralism, the nationwide revolutionary criticism cannot be carried out, and the struggle-criticism-transformation in each unit cannot be carried out. Proletarian big democracy cannot be carried out normally and deeply. Similarly, without necessary organizational discipline, the "four bigs" cannot be carried out smoothly. Now, in some places, the anarchist trend is rampant, and the phenomenon of extreme democratization is serious. There, everyone fights for themselves, and the revolutionary organizations are keen on fighting "internal wars." Discipline is lax, and the "four bigs" have not been carried out well and cannot be carried out well. In such places, proletarian big democracy will definitely not be carried out well, and the big criticism, big unity, struggle-criticism-transformation will definitely not be carried out well. Therefore, we must strongly oppose and criticize anarchism and extreme democratization tendencies to ensure that proletarian big democracy can be carried out normally and fully.

The proletarian Cultural Revolution must always mobilize the masses and rely completely on the masses to carry out the tasks of big criticism, big unity, "three-in-one," and struggle-criticism-transformation. This requires our ranks to continuously improve the level of Mao Zedong Thought, continuously overcome various non-proletarian thoughts and styles, strengthen the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the proletariat, so that the revolutionary enthusiasm of the broad revolutionary masses can be fully carried out along the proletarian revolutionary track. For revolutionary cadres and leaders of revolutionary organizations, seriously implementing democratic centralism is to forever learn from the masses, to be the students of the masses, to practice the working method of "from the masses to the masses," to strengthen collective leadership, to improve internal democratic life, otherwise, it will lead to retrogression, turning the revolutionary leadership organs into bureaucratic organs detached from the masses.

In his brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," Chairman Mao clearly puts "benefiting the consolidation of democratic centralism, rather than destroying or weakening this system" as one of the six political criteria for distinguishing between flowers and weeds. This shows that whether to choose anarchism or democratic centralism is not only a fundamental opposition of two worldviews but also a major issue of whether to have proletarian dictatorship or not in politics. Without democratic centralism, proletarian dictatorship cannot be consolidated. Today, only by seriously implementing democratic centralism can we promote the revolutionary big criticism, big unity, and struggle-criticism-transformation, consolidate the revolutionary "three-in-one" temporary power organs, and ensure the smooth progress of grasping the revolution and promoting production. Over the past year, the broad revolutionary masses have improved their ability to distinguish between flowers and weeds through struggle and learning Chairman Mao's works. Today, creating anarchism and extreme democratization are extremely detached from the masses and very unpopular. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "Anarchism does not conform to the interests and wishes of the people." If those who create anarchism insist on continuing, they are creating conditions for their own downfall. We should further mobilize the masses to overthrow and expose anarchism and extreme democratization, and firmly establish Chairman Mao's thought of democratic centralism.

As early as 1957, Chairman Mao said that we should create "a political situation where there is both centralism and democracy, both discipline and freedom, both unified will and personal comfort, and lively and active." This is Chairman Mao's great call. The proletarian Cultural Revolution has created the best conditions for the realization of this great call. Hundreds of millions of Chinese people have never been as spirited and enthusiastic as they are today, and the political situation in our country has never been as lively and colorful as it is today. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, continue to advance, and promote the proletarian Cultural Revolution, striving for the complete realization of Chairman Mao's great call.

    认真实行民主集中制，克服极端民主化倾向
    丁国钰
    当前，我们无产阶级革命派和革命领导干部，结合斗争实际，认真学习我们伟大领袖毛主席的光辉著作《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》，有特别重大的意义。
    毛主席教导我们，对敌人实行专政，在人民内部实行民主。人民内部的民主集中制是建立在广泛的民主的基础上的。正如毛主席所指出的那样：“我们的这个社会主义的民主是任何资产阶级国家所不可能有的最广大的民主。”这次文化大革命，在毛主席亲自指挥下，充分实行了无产阶级的大民主，把亿万人民群众真正地发动起来了。在毛主席的革命路线指引下，革命群众组成了浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军，在全国范围内，运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的武器，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和他们推行的资产阶级反动路线，开展了大扫荡大进军。在无产阶级专政条件下，面对党内走资本主义道路当权派这样的敌人，用小民主不行，用中民主也不行，必须用大民主，必须大胆放手发动群众，完全信任和依靠群众，才能最充分地揭露敌人，才能最彻底地战胜敌人。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派最害怕大民主，过去他用反动透顶的奴隶主义来扼杀广大党员、干部和群众的革命造反精神；在文化大革命中，他又炮制了一条资产阶级反动路线来压制民主，镇压群众。他完全破坏了党的民主集中制，他搞的是法西斯的集中，是资产阶级的专政。无产阶级的大民主，打碎了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所实行的反革命专政，并使他们陷于革命群众的汪洋大海之中，遭了灭顶之灾。无产阶级的大民主真是好得很！我们为它欢呼！
    但是，我们实行的大民主，是无产阶级专政条件下的大民主，是在集中指导下的大民主，它决不同于无政府主义，决不同于极端民主化。毛主席教导我们：“在人民内部，民主是对集中而言，自由是对纪律而言。这些都是一个统一体的两个矛盾着的侧面，它们是矛盾的，又是统一的，我们不应当片面地强调某一个侧面而否定另一个侧面。在人民内部，不可以没有自由，也不可以没有纪律；不可以没有民主，也不可以没有集中。这种民主和集中的统一，自由和纪律的统一，就是我们的民主集中制。”毛主席关于民主集中制的观点是唯物辩证法的观点，是无产阶级的世界观。无政府主义、极端民主化的观点否定集中和纪律的必要，是资产阶级唯心主义形而上学的世界观。这两者是根本对立的。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在宣扬奴隶主义破产之后，又利用革命队伍中存在的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，大肆散布怀疑一切、否定一切、打倒一切的无政府主义反动观点，企图使大民主脱离无产阶级的轨道，走上破坏无产阶级专政的邪路。奴隶主义和无政府主义，表面上看来是两个相反的极端，但实际上都是民主集中制的敌人。我们必须在两条战线上进行斗争，全面捍卫毛主席的民主集中制的正确原则，捍卫无产阶级的大民主。
    现在有些人曲解无产阶级大民主，他们认为大民主就是“绝对民主”、“绝对自由”，就是“爱干什么就干什么”，不管正确不正确，只要不合他个人或小集团的心意，就反对。他们口头上也念毛主席语录，就是在行动上不按毛主席的指示办事，他们念毛主席语录是念给别人听的，对自己没有约束力。他们无视在文化大革命的熊熊烈火中诞生的革命“三结合”临时权力机构，无视无产阶级权力机构为维护革命利益而制定的法令和纪律，无视无产阶级革命的新秩序，有的人甚至发展到破坏这些法令、纪律和秩序。这是一种小资产阶级极端民主化的非常恶劣的倾向，是完全违反毛泽东思想的。极端民主化破坏民主集中制，腐蚀革命队伍，妨碍无产阶级专政的巩固，实际上是帮助资产阶级反对无产阶级。毛主席早就指出：“极端民主化的危险，在于损伤以至完全破坏党的组织，削弱以至完全毁灭党的战斗力，使党担负不起斗争的责任，由此造成革命的失败。”
    闹极端民主化的人把民主当成目的，把无产阶级大民主同资产阶级自由化混为一谈。毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》一书中明确指出：“民主这个东西，有时看来似乎是目的，实际上，只是一种手段。”他又说：“世界上只有具体的自由，具体的民主，没有抽象的自由，抽象的民主。”根据毛主席的教导，我们对于民主、集中、自由、纪律，都要作具体的阶级分析。这次文化大革命的实质就是无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政而资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政的斗争。实行无产阶级的大民主，完全是为了更有力地粉碎资产阶级的复辟阴谋，以巩固无产阶级专政。它在任何意义上都不允许同无产阶级专政对立起来。如果有一种“民主”可以被利用来削弱和破坏无产阶级专政，那么它决不是无产阶级的民主，而一定是资产阶级民主。在当前无产阶级革命派掌权的新的条件下，党内走资本主义道路的当权派为了进行垂死挣扎，他们正在千方百计利用我们队伍中的弱点。他们最渴望无产阶级队伍陷入涣散和混乱，他们最希望无产阶级专政机构软弱无力甚至陷于瘫痪，以便于他们重新上台。因此，无政府主义、极端民主化就成为他们向无产阶级进行反攻倒算的得力助手。我们决不能抽象地认为凡“民主”、“自由”都好，凡“集中”、“纪律”都坏，每个阶级都有自己的民主和自由，同时也都有自己的集中和纪律，问题在于要哪一个阶级的民主，要哪一个阶级的集中。无产阶级大民主是“乱”修正主义旧秩序的，所以它好得很。资产阶级的自由化是“乱”无产阶级新秩序的，所以它坏得很。修正主义的纪律一定要打烂，无产阶级的纪律一定要遵守，这就是我们鲜明的立场和态度。
    无政府主义、极端民主化的思想基础是资产阶级个人主义。那些喜欢搞无政府主义的人，同时也喜欢搞奴隶主义。他们以“要大民主”为名，对上抵制革命的正确的领导，但对下，在他们所管辖的范围内，往往不给群众以真正的民主。他们听不得相反的意见，怕群众，怕群众讲话，怕群众批评，有错误自己不讲，又怕群众讲，老虎屁股摸不得。他们那里没有民主空气，有的只是盲目的服从。他们所谓“要民主”，只是给自己要的，不是给群众要的，所以闹无政府主义最凶的人，往往是闹个人主义闹山头主义最凶的人。他们也不是不要组织纪律，只是不要无产阶级的组织纪律，而只要小团体的组织纪律，稍有违背其意志者，动辄便批判、处分乃至开除。因此，在无政府主义泛滥的地方，那里既没有正确的集中，也不会有真正的民主。大家知道，过去北京市反革命修正主义集团头目彭真，向以毛主席为首的党中央大闹无政府主义，把北京变成一个针插不进、水泼不进的独立王国，同时他对下则实行专断独裁，进行封建家长式的统治。我们应当从这个反面教员身上引出必要的教训。
    无产阶级的民主必定是有领导的民主，无产阶级的大民主只能在无产阶级专政的条件下实行。无政府主义、极端民主化不仅会破坏无产阶级专政，而且直接破坏无产阶级的大民主。这次文化大革命实行的无产阶级大民主，是在高度集中指导下进行的，这个高度集中就是毛泽东思想，就是以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的绝对权威。整个运动都是按照毛主席的英明部署、按着毛主席指引的航道向前发展的。如果没有毛主席的革命路线，没有“五·一六”通知，没有“十六条”，广大革命群众不要说不能得到揭发、批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的民主，不能得到进行“四大”（大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论）的自由，而且必然要遭到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的迫害，至于掌权用权，那就更谈不上了。没有集中就没有民主，没有纪律就没有自由。所谓集中，就是要在广泛发扬民主的基础上集中群众的正确意见，总结出经验，再到群众中去，就是在集中了群众正确意见之后，统一认识、统一政策、统一计划、统一行动。没有这样的集中，全国革命的大批判不能搞，每个单位的斗批改也不能搞，无产阶级的大民主就不能正常地深入地进行下去。同样，没有必要的组织纪律，“四大”就不能顺利开展。现在，有的地方无政府主义思潮泛滥，极端民主化的现象严重，那里各自为战、人自为战。革命组织之间热中于打“内战”，纪律松弛，而“四大”却没有很好地开展，也不可能很好地开展。这样的地方，无产阶级的大民主一定搞不好，大批判、大联合、斗批改一定搞不好。所以我们大反特反无政府主义、极端民主化倾向，正是为了保证无产阶级的大民主能正常地充分地进行下去。
    无产阶级文化大革命始终都要放手发动群众，完全依靠群众来进行，大批判、大联合、“三结合”、斗批改的任务都要充分发动群众运用“四大”的武器才能完成。这就要求我们的队伍不断提高毛泽东思想水平，不断克服各种非无产阶级的思想和作风，加强无产阶级的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，以便使广大革命群众的革命积极性能够沿着无产阶级革命的轨道充分发扬。对于革命干部和革命组织的负责人来说，认真执行民主集中制，就是要永远永远地向群众学习，当群众的小学生，就是要实行从群众中来到群众中去的工作方法，加强集体领导，健全内部的民主生活，否则就会发生倒退，把革命的领导机构变成脱离群众的官僚机构。
    毛主席在《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这部光辉著作里，明确地把“有利于巩固民主集中制，而不是破坏或者削弱这个制度”作为辨别香花和毒草的六条政治标准之一。这说明要无政府主义还是要民主集中制，不仅是两种世界观的根本对立，而且在政治上是要不要无产阶级专政的大是大非的问题。没有民主集中制，无产阶级专政不可能巩固。在今天只有认真实行民主集中制，才能促进革命的大批判、大联合和斗批改，才能巩固革命的“三结合”临时权力机构，才能保证抓革命促生产的顺利进行。一年来广大革命群众在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，辨别香花和毒草的能力有了很大的提高。在今天，闹无政府主义、闹极端民主化都是极端脱离群众、很不得人心的。正如毛主席指明的：“无政府状态不符合人民的利益和愿望。”闹无政府主义的人如果还要坚持闹下去，就是给自己的垮台创造条件。我们应当进一步发动群众起来把无政府主义、极端民主化批倒搞臭，把毛主席的民主集中制的思想牢牢树立起来。
    早在一九五七年，毛主席就说过，要造成“又有集中又有民主，又有纪律又有自由，又有统一意志，又有个人心情舒畅、生动活泼那样一种政治局面。”这是毛主席的一个伟大号召。无产阶级文化大革命为这个伟大号召的实现，创造了最好的条件。亿万中国人民，从来没有象今天这样意气风发、斗志昂扬，我国的政治局面从来没有象今天这样生动活泼、绚烂多采。让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，再接再厉，把无产阶级文化大革命继续向前推进，争取毛主席的伟大号召得到完全实现。
