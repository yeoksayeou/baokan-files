After more than a year of great struggle in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have exposed and overthrown the most corrupt clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and we have rooted out a batch of representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the organs of proletarian dictatorship. The achievements we have made are shocking to the world.

But can we conclude from this that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has been "completed"? That the clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, big and small, has been "thoroughly done for"?

No!

The gang of counter-revolutionary revisionists who have been exposed are fallen dogs, wounded tigers, and poisonous snakes that feel the threat of winter but have not yet frozen stiff.

As Chairman Mao pointed out in his criticism of the counter-revolutionary Hu Feng clique: "This reactionary clique, which hates the Communist Party, hates the people, and hates the revolution to the point of madness, is not truly laying down its arms but is attempting to preserve its 'strength' by continuing to use the two-faced method, waiting for the opportunity to stage a comeback."

Have we not already seen this phenomenon clearly?

Some of these scoundrels, although they have been overthrown, still refuse to admit their heinous crimes against the Party and socialism. At every opportunity, they viciously launch counter-attacks. Some of them have even maliciously issued so-called "confessions" that are actually counter-revolutionary manifestos.

Some of these scoundrels harbor deep hatred for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. To save themselves from impending doom, they manipulate and utilize some conservative or reactionary organizations to deceive a part of the masses and desperately struggle against the revolutionary forces. They bare their fangs and claws, fight bare-handed, and even resort to poisoning the proletarian revolutionaries.

Some of these scoundrels try to act harmless and pitiful to deceive the people into sympathizing with them, so they can slip through. They sharpen their wits to infiltrate from within to corrupt and disintegrate our revolutionary ranks and carry out a capitalist restoration.

Therefore, we must not pity the wicked, we must not let down our guard, and we must not let the revolution be half-hearted.

"One should pursue the fleeing enemy with all remaining strength, and should not seek fame by imitating Xiang Yu."

We must mobilize hundreds of millions of people to, with the thorough revolutionary spirit of beating fallen dogs, launch a great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle against the reactionary forces that hate the Party, hate the people, and hate the revolution.

Comrade Lin Biao said: "Overthrowing the political power of the bourgeoisie and the exploiting classes can be accomplished in a relatively short period. Overthrowing their system of ownership can also be accomplished in a short period. However, overthrowing the ideological strongholds of the exploiting classes and the bourgeoisie is a very complex and difficult task that requires a long time. If we do not win on this front, then the victories achieved in the political and economic spheres can be in vain..."

The number one capitalist-roader within the Party is the representative of the bourgeoisie within our Party, the backer of all the big and small counter-revolutionary revisionists who have infiltrated the organs of proletarian dictatorship, and the epitome of the reactionary thoughts of both old and new revisionism. He is the greatest defender of all old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits.

It is this number one capitalist-roader within the Party who, for a long time, systematically and obstinately pushed the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, opposing the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. Before the nation's victory, he vigorously advocated the "parliamentary road," advocating the surrender of the people's army led by the Communist Party, opposing the armed seizure of power, and opposing the establishment of proletarian dictatorship. After the nation's liberation, he vigorously promoted the idea that "exploitation is meritorious," advocating the development of urban and rural capitalism, and opposing socialist transformation. After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production, he vigorously advocated the theory of the "extinction of class struggle," carrying out a capitalist restoration, and attempting to turn proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship. Internationally, he actively promoted the line of "three surrenders and one annihilation," using every means to cater to the needs of imperialism and modern revisionism, and strangling the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries. For a long time, he usurped important powers in our Party and state, using the political influence he had deceived to raise the "red flag" against the red flag, vigorously peddling his revisionist goods.

The proletarian revolutionaries and the broad revolutionary masses have created a great victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution by overthrowing the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, pulling them down from their horses, and making them stand aside. However, overthrowing them organizationally does not mean overthrowing them politically and ideologically. We must politically, ideologically, and theoretically overthrow their counter-revolutionary revisionist line, thoroughly purge their poison in all fronts and fields, thoroughly expose their ugly bourgeois souls and reactionary ideological systems, and make them into a pile of filth that is despised by humanity. Only in this way can we truly overthrow them.

If we only seize the administrative and organizational power of the clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, but do not seize their political and ideological power, then our struggle for power is not thorough, and the power we seize is not consolidated; the power we have already seized also has the danger of being seized back. If the class struggle on the political and ideological front is not thorough, capitalist restoration can happen at any time.

Lenin said: "When the old society dies, its corpse cannot be put into a coffin and buried in a grave. It rots and stinks among us and poisons us." If we do not mobilize hundreds of millions of people to carry out a great criticism of the revolution, uproot the poisonous roots of the exploiting class's thoughts, and clean up the garbage left by the exploiting class in every corner, they will continue to spread foul smells, continue to spread poison, and continue to harm the people. Those old revisionists, such as Bernstein, Kautsky, Trotsky, Bukharin, and the like, have not they long been dead? But their revisionist junk has not been buried in the grave. The junk peddled by China's Khrushchev is precisely what he picked up from his ancestors.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a great political and ideological revolution. This great revolution is to thoroughly criticize bourgeois ideology, establish proletarian ideology, thoroughly criticize revisionist ideology, and establish Mao Zedong Thought. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary intellectuals must raise high the invincible banner of Mao Zedong Thought and launch a mass movement of great criticism against the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Seven hundred million people participating in this great criticism movement is a great and meaningful event for the world. We must spare no effort to complete this most urgent and important combat mission.

In the history of the proletarian revolution, every great political debate and every great ideological revolution has inevitably brought about great development and great leaps in the revolution. In the new era when the world enters with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner, this unprecedented great criticism movement carried out by the Chinese people will surely promote the leap-forward development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, greatly consolidate our proletarian dictatorship, and bring about a new and vigorous situation in the socialist construction of our country. It will also have a profound and far-reaching impact on the world proletarian revolutionary cause.

### 把革命的大批判进行到底

    把革命的大批判进行到底
    经过一年多来无产阶级文化大革命的伟大斗争，我们揭露和打倒了党内最大的最腐朽的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，揪出了一批混进无产阶级专政机构内部的资产阶级代表人物。我们取得的成就，是震惊世界的。
    但是，我们能不能由此得出结论说，无产阶级文化大革命已经“大功告成”了呢？党内一小撮大大小小的走资本主义道路当权派已经“彻底完蛋”了呢？
    不能！
    被揪出来的这伙反革命修正主义分子，是落水的恶狗，是受伤的老虎，是感到冬天威胁但还未冻僵的毒蛇。
    正象毛主席在批判胡风反革命集团时所指出的：“这个仇恨共产党、仇恨人民、仇恨革命达到了疯狂程度的反动集团，绝不是真正放下武器，而是企图继续用两面派的方式保存他们的‘实力’，等待时机，卷土重来。”
    我们不是已经千真万确地看到了这种现象吗？
    有些家伙虽然已经被打倒了，但是他们对自己反党反社会主义的滔天罪行，还是死不认账，一有机会就穷凶极恶地进行反攻倒算。有的还恶毒地抛出了名为“认罪”、实为反扑的反革命宣言书。
    有些家伙对无产阶级革命派和革命群众怀着刻骨仇恨，他们为了挽救自己将要灭亡的命运，总是操纵和利用一些保守组织或反动组织，蒙蔽一部分群众，拚命地向革命势力进行最后挣扎。他们张牙舞爪，赤膊上阵，甚至不惜向无产阶级革命派下毒手。
    还有些家伙竭力装着无害而且可怜的样子，妄想骗取人民对他们的同情，以便蒙混过关。他们削尖脑袋往里钻，就是为了从内部来腐蚀和瓦解我们的革命的队伍，搞资本主义复辟。
    因此，我们决不能怜惜恶人，我们决不能丧失警惕，我们决不能使革命半途而废。
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”
    我们一定要发动亿万群众，以痛打落水狗的彻底革命精神，对那些仇恨党、仇恨人民、仇恨革命的反动势力，展开革命的大揭发，大批判，大斗争。
    林彪同志说：“推翻资产阶级、剥削阶级的政权是在较短时间可以完成的。推翻它的所有制，短时间也可以完成。可是，推翻剥削阶级、资产阶级在思想里面的阵地，这是很不简单、很不容易的，需要很长的时间。而这个战线上如果不打胜仗的话，那么，政权方面所取得的胜利和经济方面所取得的胜利，可以前功尽弃……”
    党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，是资产阶级在我们党内的总代表，是钻进无产阶级专政机构内部大大小小反革命修正主义分子的总后台，是资产阶级和新老修正主义反动思想的集大成者，是一切旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的最大的维护者。
    就是这个党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派，长期地、系统地、顽固地推行资产阶级反动路线，对抗以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线。在全国胜利以前，他竭力宣扬“议会道路”，主张交出共产党领导的人民军队，反对武装夺取政权，反对建立无产阶级专政。全国解放以后，他大肆鼓吹“剥削有功”，主张发展城乡资本主义，反对社会主义改造。在生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，他又拚命宣扬“阶级斗争熄灭论”，大搞资本主义复辟，妄图变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政。在国际上，他积极推行“三降一灭”的投降主义路线，千方百计地迎合帝国主义和现代修正主义的需要，扼杀各国人民的革命斗争。长期以来，他窃据我们党和国家的重要职权，利用他骗取的政治影响，打着“红旗”反红旗，大肆推销他那一套修正主义货色。
    无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，大造党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，把他们拉下马，叫他们靠边站，这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利。但是，从组织上打倒，并不等于从政治思想上打倒。必须从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们的反革命修正主义路线批倒批臭，彻底肃清他们在各条战线、各个领域里的流毒，把他们丑恶的资产阶级灵魂，反动的思想体系，彻底揭发出来，使他们变成不齿于人类的狗屎堆。只有这样，才能真正把他们彻底打倒。
    如果只夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的行政的权，组织的权，而没有夺政治思想上的权，那么，我们的夺权斗争就不是彻底的，我们夺到的权就不是巩固的；已经夺到的权，也还有重新被夺走的危险。政治思想战线上的阶级斗争如果进行得不彻底，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。
    列宁说：“旧社会灭亡的时候，它的死尸是不能装进棺材、埋入坟墓的。它在我们中间腐烂发臭并且毒害我们”。我们如果不发动亿万群众进行革命的大批判，把剥削阶级思想的毒根拔掉，把剥削阶级留藏在各个角落里的垃圾打扫干净，它们就会继续散布臭气，继续传播毒菌，继续危害人民。那些老牌修正主义者，如伯恩斯坦、考茨基、托洛茨基、布哈林之流，不是早已呜呼哀哉了吗？但是，他们的修正主义破烂货色，并没有埋入坟墓。中国的赫鲁晓夫所贩卖的那一套，正是从他的老祖宗那里拣来的。
    无产阶级文化大革命，是一场政治思想的大革命。这场大革命，就是要大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想，大破修正主义思想，大立毛泽东思想。广大工农兵群众、革命干部和革命知识分子，必须高举所向无敌的毛泽东思想大旗，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，展开群众性的革命大批判运动。七亿人民都来投入这场大批判运动，是一件了不起的大事，有世界意义的大事。我们应当全力以赴地去完成这个最迫切、最重大的战斗任务。
    在无产阶级革命的历史上，每一场政治大论战，每一次伟大的思想革命，都必然带来革命的大发展和历史的大飞跃。在全世界进入以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代，中国人民进行的这场规模空前的革命大批判运动，必将促进我国无产阶级文化大革命的飞跃发展，必将大大巩固我国的无产阶级专政，必将使我国社会主义建设出现朝气蓬勃的新局面，也必将给世界无产阶级革命事业带来极其深远的影响。
