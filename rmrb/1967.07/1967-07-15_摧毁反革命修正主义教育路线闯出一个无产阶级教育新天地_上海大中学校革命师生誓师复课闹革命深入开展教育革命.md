In the midst of the resounding victories of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee held a rally on July 13 to swear in the revolutionary teachers and students of Shanghai's colleges and universities to return to classes, make revolution, and deepen the educational revolution.

This rally marks the beginning of a new phase in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai's colleges and universities, where the educational revolution will be thoroughly carried out. Over ten thousand revolutionary teachers and students from colleges and universities attended the rally, brimming with enthusiasm and high morale. They vowed to learn from the comrades of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics, to immediately launch a new high tide of returning to classes and making revolution. They declared that under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they would continue to uphold the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, speak, act, and rebel. They would thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and thoroughly reform the old educational system, becoming the pioneers in creating a brand-new proletarian educational system in human history.

Currently, the situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Shanghai's colleges and universities is excellent. Many schools have achieved revolutionary great unity; many middle schools responded to Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's call several months ago to return to classes and make revolution; many universities have also extensively carried out activities for the educational revolution. After the news of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics returning to classes and making revolution was broadcast, the broad masses of Red Guards and revolutionary teachers and students in Shanghai's colleges and universities responded enthusiastically, launching a tide of returning to classes and making revolution, and deepening the educational revolution in just a few days.

At the rally, representatives from Fudan University, Tongji University, East China Normal University, Shanghai No. 6 Girls' Middle School, Laoshan Primary School, Shanghai No. 10 Cotton Mill Half-Work Half-Study School, and other schools that have achieved revolutionary great unity and begun to return to classes and make revolution, as well as representatives from schools that are in the process of achieving revolutionary great unity, spoke. They said that at this critical moment of the struggle between the two classes, two lines, and two roads, schools carrying out the return to classes and making revolution is a major event related to the complete victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Returning to classes and making revolution, and deepening the educational revolution, is the current direction of the struggle. We must firmly grasp this direction, deeply carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation within our units, further promote and consolidate revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and raise our revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline. We must closely follow Chairman Mao, become models of returning to classes and making revolution, and pioneers in exploring and leading the educational revolution.

Many revolutionary teacher and student representatives pointed out in their speeches that the educational front is an important aspect of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The old educational system has a history of hundreds of years, with deep roots and wide influence. For a long time, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have implemented a counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line in the educational field, and the bourgeois intellectuals have dominated the schools. Now, we are returning to classes and making revolution, and deepening the educational revolution. We must uphold the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, speak, act, and rebel, become thorough revolutionaries, and not reformists. We must prioritize destruction and then construction. Only in this way can we forge a new era of proletarian education.

They said that currently, the focus of returning to classes and making revolution is to teach Mao Zedong Thought and revolutionary criticism, and to practice the basics of struggle, criticism, and transformation. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" as the highest guideline, learn from workers, peasants, and soldiers, criticize the bourgeoisie, and currently focus on criticism, gradually transitioning to learning in the future. They said that returning to classes and making revolution must fully mobilize the masses, implement the mass line, and use the weapons of big debates, big-character posters, big meetings, and big struggles to launch a magnificent mass revolutionary movement. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, dare to practice, and dare to innovate. Learn to swim while swimming, learn revolution while making revolution. Practice, summarize, and improve while doing.

Representatives from colleges and universities that are actively achieving revolutionary great unity spoke at the rally, saying that returning to classes and making revolution, and deepening the educational revolution, is a broad "people's war." Without revolutionary great unity, this war cannot be won. They expressed their determination to firmly achieve revolutionary great unity through returning to classes and making revolution, break down selfishness and establish public spirit, stop "internal wars," make more self-criticisms, seek common ground while reserving differences, and quickly achieve the broadest revolutionary great unity with the leftists as the core.

Revolutionary teacher and student representatives also pointed out that revolutionary teachers and Red Guards are both masters of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, both a revolutionary force and an object of revolution. Revolutionary teachers must dare to break down selfishness and establish public spirit, dare to make revolution in the depths of their souls. Overcome the wrong thoughts of "fear" and "waiting." Go to the students, and together with the students, make a big revolution.

Members of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee attended the rally and spoke at the meeting.

    摧毁反革命修正主义教育路线闯出一个无产阶级教育新天地
    上海大中学校革命师生誓师复课闹革命深入开展教育革命
    新华社上海十四日电　在无产阶级文化大革命取得节节胜利的凯歌声中，上海市革命委员会十三日召开了上海大中学校复课闹革命深入开展教育革命誓师大会。
    这个大会标志着上海大中学校无产阶级文化大革命进入了深入开展教育革命的崭新阶段。参加大会的一万多名大中学校革命师生意气风发，斗志昂扬，决心向北京航空学院的战友学习，立即掀起复课闹革命的新高潮。他们表示，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想指导下，要继续发扬敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢造反的无产阶级革命精神，彻底摧毁反革命修正主义教育路线，彻底改革旧的教育制度，做创造人类历史上崭新的无产阶级教育制度的开路先锋。
    目前，上海大中学校文化大革命形势大好。不少学校已经实现了革命的大联合；许多中学早在几个月前就响应毛主席、党中央的号召，实现了复课闹革命；许多大学也广泛地展开了教育革命的活动。北京航空学院复课闹革命的消息广播以后，上海大中学校广大红卫兵小将和革命师生闻风而动，几天之内，掀起了复课闹革命，深入开展教育革命的热潮。
    在誓师大会上，上海复旦大学、同济大学、华东师范大学、上海市控江中学、第六女中、崂山初级中学、上海国棉十厂半工半读学校等一些已经实现了革命大联合并且开始复课闹革命的学校的代表和一些正在实现革命大联合的学校的代表发了言。他们说，在当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的关键时刻，学校开展复课闹革命，这是关系到夺取无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的大事。复课闹革命，深入开展教育革命，这是当前斗争的大方向。我们一定要紧紧掌握这个大方向，深入开展本单位的斗、批、改，进一步促进和巩固革命的大联合、革命的“三结合”，提高我们的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。我们一定要紧跟毛主席，做复课闹革命的模范，做教育革命的探索者和开路先锋。
    许多革命师生代表在发言中指出，教育战线是无产阶级文化大革命的一个重要方面。旧的教育制度已经有了成百上千年的历史，基础很深，流毒很广。长期以来，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在教育界推行了一条反革命修正主义教育路线，资产阶级知识分子统治着学校。现在，我们复课闹革命，深入开展教育革命，一定要发扬敢想、敢说、敢干、敢闯、敢造反的无产阶级革命精神，做彻底的革命派，决不做改良派，破字当头，大破大立。只有这样才能闯出一个无产阶级教育的新天地。
    他们说，当前开展复课闹革命，首先是上好毛泽东思想的课，上好革命大批判的课，练好斗、批、改的基本功。我们必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以毛主席的“五·七”指示为最高纲领，学工、学农、学军，批判资产阶级，目前以大批判为主，将来逐步过渡到以学为主。他们说，复课闹革命必须充分发动群众，贯彻群众路线，运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的武器，掀起一个轰轰烈烈的群众性革命运动。我们要遵循毛主席的教导，敢于实践，敢于创新。在游泳中学会游泳，在革命斗争中学会革命。边实践、边总结、边改进。
    正在积极实现革命大联合的大中学校革命师生代表在发言中说，复课闹革命，深入开展教育革命，这是一场广泛的“人民战争”，没有革命的大联合，就不能打好这场战争。他们表示，一定要坚定地通过复课闹革命，破私立公，停止“内战”，多作自我批评，求大同，存小异，尽快地实现以左派为核心的最广泛的革命大联合。
    革命师生代表还指出，革命教师和红卫兵小将一样，都是无产阶级文化大革命的主人，既是革命的一份力量，又要把自己当作革命的对象。革命教师必须敢于破私立公，敢于在灵魂深处闹革命。克服“怕”和“等”的错误思想。到学生中去，同学生一起大闹革命。
    上海市革命委员会的成员参加了昨天的大会并在会上讲了话。
