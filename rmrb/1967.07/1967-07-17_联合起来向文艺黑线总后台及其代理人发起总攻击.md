Central directly affiliated arts organizations, art academies, film, publishing, and cultural relics systems' proletarian revolutionaries, since July 1st, have raised the banner of revolutionary criticism guided by Mao Zedong Thought. Following the joint struggle and criticism of the greatest capitalist-roader in the party and his agent in the arts world—revolutionary revisionist elements Zhou Yang and Xiao Wangdong—they have launched a comprehensive attack and settlement on the greatest handful of capitalist-roaders in the arts world, including Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Lin Mo Han, Xia Yan, Qi Yanming, Tian Han, Yang Hansheng, Xiao Wangdong, Chen Huangmei, Zhang Zhixiang, and Shao Yulin.

This great criticism is the current center of work for the central directly affiliated arts system and the driving force for the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries. It has further exposed the cover of class struggle between the old Propaganda Department and the old Ministry of Culture, further revealed the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his revisionist accomplices in the arts world in attempting to restore capitalism, and is currently cleansing the poison of the revolutionary revisionist arts black line in various cultural and artistic fields. This criticism has consolidated and developed the great unity of the proletarian revolutionaries in the central directly affiliated arts system; and this great unity, in turn, has powerfully promoted this revolutionary criticism. Through this criticism, cadres have been identified and examined, creating conditions for the realization of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and has powerfully promoted creation, production, promoted the resumption of classes and the revolution, and promoted the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. The mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works in the capital's arts world has also reached a new peak in this criticism. A great army of proletarian revolutionary arts is growing and strengthening in the struggle.

In the revolutionary criticism, consolidate and develop the great unity of the revolution

"Organize tens of millions of people, mobilize a surging revolutionary army, this is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolutionaries." The proletarian revolutionaries of the central directly affiliated arts system listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. They say: "Although there have been various disagreements among our revolutionary mass organizations in the past, in the struggle against the enemy, we are all revolutionary comrades-in-arms. Since we have a common ideological foundation—Mao Zedong Thought, since we have a common enemy—the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, since we have a common resolve—to defend Chairman Mao to the death, to defend Mao Zedong Thought to the death, why should we fight 'internal wars'? Why should we let the enemy laugh at us from the sidelines? Why should we not unite in the struggle against the enemy?"

The proletarian revolutionaries of the central directly affiliated arts system deeply understand that they are not uniting for the sake of unity, but for the sake of thoroughly defeating the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and for the sake of carrying the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end. This unity is a revolutionary great unity that firmly grasps the direction of struggle, and not a "muddling through," not a compromise. On the contrary, it is precisely those who do not grasp the direction of struggle, do not correctly handle the two types of contradictions, and ignore the enemy while being keen on fighting "internal wars" who are "muddling through" and compromising in the sharp struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines.

On this issue, the revolutionary young warriors of the Central Conservatory of Music have provided valuable experience. In this great criticism, they took on the task of fighting against Zhou Yang, the "ancestor" of the revolutionary revisionist arts black line. Faced with this tough battle, should they unite to thoroughly defeat, overthrow, and expose the revolutionary revisionist element Zhou Yang, or should they, from the perspective of small group interests, regard the contradictions among revolutionary mass organizations as greater than the sky, continue to fight "internal wars," and ignore the enemy? What should they do? The problem was sharply presented to them. The revolutionary young warriors who are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao resolutely declared: "A thousand contradictions, ten thousand contradictions, the contradiction with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party is the principal contradiction; a thousand principles, ten thousand principles, thoroughly defeating the revolutionary revisionist elements is the greatest principle." Because they firmly grasped the line of revolutionary criticism, several revolutionary mass organizations that had long had friction finally united under the premise of a unified direction. The enemy was thoroughly isolated. One victory after another, unprecedented in history, deeply educated the revolutionary young warriors: Only when the proletarian revolutionaries unite, will the revolutionary revisionist elements be thoroughly annihilated!

Originally, there was a widespread so-called "50 days versus 17 years" dispute in the arts world, that is, on the issue of the revolutionary revisionist arts black line and the bourgeois reactionary line, there were serious disagreements. Through the great criticism and struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, the broad revolutionary masses realized that the revolutionary revisionist arts black line and the bourgeois reactionary line are inseparable. The 50-day bourgeois reactionary line was proposed to protect the 17-year revolutionary revisionist arts black line, both coming from the bourgeois command headquarters represented by China's Khrushchev. Thus, the contradictions between organizations and comrades were eliminated, and the great unity of the revolution was further consolidated.

The practice of the great criticism and great unity of the central directly affiliated arts system tells us: We must firmly grasp the revolutionary criticism. Revolutionary criticism is the driving force of the great unity of the revolution; and the great unity of the revolution is the basic guarantee for overthrowing, defeating, and exposing the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party.

Organize a surging revolutionary army and fight this people's war

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Revolutionary war is a war of the masses, only by mobilizing the masses can we wage war, only by relying on the masses can we wage war." The proletarian revolutionaries of the capital's arts world, in this revolutionary criticism, achieved the great unity of the revolution and organized a surging cultural revolutionary army. Every soldier in this proletarian revolutionary army is a fighter, full of spirit and fighting spirit, fearless of fatigue, and fighting continuously. In the battle that lasted for more than ten days, on more than ten battlefields, they, with boundless hatred, launched a fierce close-quarters struggle against the backstage of the revolutionary revisionist arts black line—China's Khrushchev and his handful of generals.

In this battle, the proletarian revolutionaries of the capital's arts world deeply felt that to organize a surging revolutionary force and fight a people's war, they must criticize the erroneous idea of "unique leftism," which relies only on a few people; they must also criticize the erroneous idea of not paying attention to the positive factors of people, relying only on "materials as the commander." They believe that they must truly implement Chairman Mao's teaching that the proletariat must not only liberate itself but also liberate all of humanity. If the proletariat cannot liberate all of humanity, it cannot ultimately liberate itself. They believe in and rely on the masses, believe in and rely on the army, and believe in and rely on the majority of the cadres. Some units even invited representatives of poor peasants, Red Guards, and revolutionary comrades from relevant units to participate in the battle. On the issue of cadres, they dared to liberate a large area, dared to let those who had made mistakes, even serious mistakes, participate in the struggle meetings, encouraged and helped them to stand up, to expose and criticize the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party in close-quarters combat, to perform on the front line and achieve merits on the front line, and at the same time, to let the broad revolutionary masses better identify and examine cadres, laying the foundation for the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

A characteristic of this struggle in the capital's arts world to criticize and fight against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party is that it has mobilized the masses and relatively fully implemented the mass line. In this people's war, the revolutionary warriors of the capital's arts world dared to struggle and knew how to struggle, using flexible and mobile strategies and tactics, adopting the method of combining large, medium, and small meetings, "exposing in large meetings and criticizing in small meetings," blooming all over, and proceeding in a cross-cutting manner. Some units also held exhibitions of the criminal history and crimes of revolutionary revisionist elements, picture exhibitions, and screenings of related poisonous films inside and outside the meeting venue, powerfully supporting the criticism and struggle.

"The ultimate source of the great power of war lies among the people." Through this struggle, the broad proletarian revolutionary warriors of the arts world deeply felt the great truth of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

With class struggle as the key, fiercely criticize and fight against the greatest handful of capitalist-roaders within the party

Chairman Mao teaches us, "The bourgeois representatives who have infiltrated the party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionist elements. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." For 17 years, and even for more than 30 years, Lu Dingyi, Zhou Yang, Xia Yan, Lin Mo Han, Xiao Wangdong, and the like, under the protection and support of the greatest capitalist-roader within the party, infiltrated the cultural and artistic circles, usurped leading positions, and implemented bourgeois dictatorship over the proletariat. They vigorously promoted a bourgeois arts ideology, modern revisionist arts ideology, and the so-called combination of 1930s arts and revolutionary revisionist arts black line, making the arts world chaotic and full of poisonous weeds, vigorously preparing public opinion for the restoration of capitalism in China. They are the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements pointed out by Chairman Mao. This struggle in the arts world is also a life-and-death struggle between the restoration of the bourgeoisie and the counter-restoration of the proletariat, a struggle for power in the ideological realm.

The Central Conservatory of Music, in fighting against the revolutionary revisionist element Zhou Yang, firmly grasped the line of class struggle, from "The Story of Ah Q" to "The Dismissal of Hai Rui," from the "National Defense Literature" of the 1930s to the "People's Arts" of the 1960s, accurately hitting the vital points of this old counter-revolutionary two-faced Zhou Yang, fiercely striking the enemy, and exposing Zhou Yang's consistent counter-revolutionary methods and ugly faces of using the "red flag" to oppose the red flag.

Some units, in the great criticism, adopted the method of recalling bitterness and thinking of sweetness to carry out class education, which is also an effective method to promote the movement of great criticism and great struggle.

The proletarian revolutionaries of the capital's arts world deeply feel that in the great criticism of a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionist elements, they must always firmly grasp the line of struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines. Grasping this line is to grasp the bull by the nose, to grasp the center, to see through the complex phenomena to the essence; to grasp the vital points of the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements; to better understand the long-term nature of the struggle between the restoration of the bourgeoisie and the counter-restoration of the proletariat, "if things are not done well, the restoration of capitalism may be possible at any time"; to better understand the importance of consolidating and strengthening the dictatorship of the proletariat and the profound significance of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat.

Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of the great criticism and great struggle of the revolution

The boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought is our most sharp weapon in fighting against the enemy. To politically, ideologically, theoretically, and organizationally overthrow, defeat, and expose the greatest handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, we must put the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and heavier than everything. As Comrade Lin Biao said, "To carry out this cultural revolution well, what do we rely on? We rely on the great Mao Zedong Thought, we rely on the wisdom and strength of the masses." The practice of struggle in the capital's arts world eloquently proves that Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of the great criticism of the revolution. Without Mao Zedong Thought, one cannot move an inch; with Mao Zedong Thought, one is invincible.

The enemy is extremely cunning, they all have years of counter-revolutionary experience, always trying to get away with it, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. Through the practice of struggle, the broad revolutionary arts warriors discovered that these demons and snakes are most afraid of Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, they conducted thorough investigations and reconnaissance, firmly grasped the key issues, and compared the instructions of Chairman Mao with the words and deeds of this handful of counter-revolutionary revisionist elements. In this way, this handful of counter-revolutionary revisionist elements, under the powerful mirror of Mao Zedong Thought, one by one revealed their ugly true forms.

In this unprecedented scale and unprecedentedly profound great criticism and great struggle, the proletarian revolutionaries of the arts world remembered Chairman Mao's teaching: "Revolutionary war is an antidote, it not only expels the enemy's poison but also cleanses our own filth." They understood that the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat is a great ideological revolutionary movement to educate and transform people with Mao Zedong Thought. The proletarian revolutionaries must dare to launch a "close-quarters combat" against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, and also dare to launch a fire against the "self" in their minds, deeply touch their souls, and change their worldviews.

The great leader Chairman Mao recently pointed out: It is necessary to guide the small-bourgeois ideology within our ranks to the track of the proletarian revolution, this is a key issue for the victory of the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat. The broad proletarian revolutionaries of the arts world deeply feel that in the face of great enemies, if small-groupism, opportunism, and other non-proletarian ideologies are allowed to continue to develop, it is a crime. Doing so, the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party cannot be overthrown, defeated, and exposed, the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat will have the danger of being aborted halfway, our proletarian dictatorship will be buried, and our socialist mountains and rivers will change color. They said, we must follow the teachings of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, we must "regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution."

The reality of class struggle has made the hearts of the broad revolutionary arts warriors more open and their horizons broader. They said well: "We must not fight for our small group's pride, we must fight for Chairman Mao's pride, for the pride of the proletariat! We must be genuine revolutionary arts warriors of Chairman Mao!"

The great criticism movement in the capital's arts world is in full swing. The broad revolutionary arts warriors, with high fighting spirit, are raising the banner of revolutionary criticism even higher, determined to launch a "storm" of great criticism and great struggle, to overthrow, defeat, and expose all the big and small capitalist-roaders within the party in the arts world! To seize back all the arts positions occupied by the revolutionary revisionist arts black line! Let the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought be planted all over the arts world! All over China! All over the world!

    中央直属文艺系统革命派高举毛泽东思想的革命批判旗帜
    联合起来向文艺黑线总后台及其代理人发起总攻击
    进一步揭开了旧中宣部旧文化部阶级斗争的盖子；进一步暴露了中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在文艺界的反革命同伙的滔天罪行；正在肃清反革命修正主义文艺黑线在文艺各领域的流毒。
    新华社十六日讯　中央直属文艺团体、艺术院校、电影、图博文物系统的无产阶级革命派，七月一日以来，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判旗帜，在联合斗争、批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其在文艺界的代理人——反革命修正主义分子周扬、萧望东之后，乘胜追击，口诛笔伐，对文艺界党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派陆定一、周扬、林默涵、夏衍、齐燕铭、田汉、阳翰笙、萧望东、陈荒煤、张致祥、邵荃麟等发起了总攻击、总清算。
    这一场大批判，是当前中央直属文艺系统工作的中心，是推进无产阶级革命派大联合的动力。它进一步揭开了旧中宣部、旧文化部两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的盖子；进一步暴露了中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在文艺界的代理人实行资本主义复辟的滔天罪行；并且正进一步肃清反革命修正主义文艺黑线在文化艺术各个领域的流毒。这场大批判，巩固和发展了中央直属文艺系统无产阶级革命派的革命的大联合；而革命的大联合，又有力地推动了这场革命的大批判。通过这场大批判，还识别和考察了干部，为实现革命的“三结合”创造了条件，同时有力地促进了创作、生产，促进了复课闹革命，促进了本单位的斗批改。首都文艺界活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，也在这场大批判中推向了新的高潮。一支无产阶级革命文艺大军，正在斗争中成长壮大。
    在革命大批判中巩固和发展革命的大联合
    “组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”中央直属文艺系统的无产阶级革命派最听毛主席的话，他们说：“在我们革命群众组织之间，过去虽然存在着这样那样的分歧，但是，在对敌斗争中，我们都是革命的战友。既然我们有共同的思想基础——毛泽东思想，既然我们有共同的敌人——党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，既然我们有共同的决心——誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫毛泽东思想，我们有什么理由打‘内战’？我们有什么理由让敌人在一旁看笑话？我们有什么理由不在对敌斗争中联合起来？”
    中央直属文艺系统的无产阶级革命派深深懂得，他们绝不是为联合而联合，而是为了彻底打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派而联合，为把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底而联合。这种联合，是牢牢掌握斗争大方向的革命的大联合，而绝不是“抹稀泥”，绝不是搞折衷主义。相反，正是那种不掌握斗争的大方向，不严格区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，置敌人于不顾而热衷于打“内战”的人，才是在尖锐的两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争中“抹稀泥”、搞折衷主义。
    在这个问题上，中央音乐学院的革命小将提供了宝贵的经验。在这次大批判中，他们担负了重点斗争反革命修正主义文艺黑线的“祖师爷”周扬的战斗任务。在这个硬仗面前，是联合起来，把反革命修正主义分子周扬彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭呢，还是从小团体利益出发，把革命群众组织之间的矛盾看得比天还大，继续打“内战”，而置敌人于不顾呢？何去何从？问题尖锐地摆在他们面前。无限忠于毛主席的革命小将们斩钉截铁地表示：“一千个矛盾，一万个矛盾，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾是主要矛盾；一千条原则，一万条原则，把反革命修正主义分子彻底打倒是最大的原则。”由于紧紧抓住了革命的大批判这条纲，几个长期有磨擦的革命群众组织，终于在大方向一致的前提下联合起来了。敌人彻底孤立了。一个个前所未有的斗争的胜利，深深地教育了革命小将：只有无产阶级革命派联合之日，才是反革命修正主义分子彻底灭亡之时！
    原来文艺界普遍存在着所谓“五十天与十七年”之争，也就是在对待反革命修正主义文艺黑线和资产阶级反动路线的问题上，存在着严重的分歧。通过对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争，广大革命群众认识到，反革命修正主义文艺黑线和资产阶级反动路线是二位一体、不可分割的。五十天的资产阶级反动路线，是为保护十七年的反革命修正主义文艺黑线而提出的，都是来自以中国的赫鲁晓夫为代表的资产阶级司令部的。这样，就使各组织之间，同志之间消除了隔阂，进一步巩固了革命的大联合。
    中央直属文艺系统革命的大批判、大联合的实践告诉我们：必须狠抓革命的大批判。革命的大批判，是革命大联合的动力；而革命的大联合，则是斗倒、斗垮、斗臭党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的基本保证。
    组织起浩浩荡荡的革命大军，打好这一场人民战争
    毛主席教导我们：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”首都文艺界无产阶级革命派在这次革命的大批判中，实现了革命的大联合，组织起了浩浩荡荡的文化革命大军。这支无产阶级革命大军的每个战士都是战斗员，他们意气风发，斗志昂扬，不怕疲劳，连续作战。在为期十几天的战斗中，在十几个战场上，他们怀着无比的仇恨，向着反革命修正主义文艺黑线的总后台——中国的赫鲁晓夫及其手下的一小撮干将，展开了一场声势浩大的短兵相接的斗争。
    在这一场战斗中，首都文艺界无产阶级革命派深深地体会到，要组织起一支浩浩荡荡的革命队伍，打一场人民战争，必须批判那种“唯我独左”，只依靠少数人的错误思想；也必须批判那种不注意发挥人的积极因素，只靠“材料挂帅”的错误思想。他们认为，必须切切实实地实行毛主席关于无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放的伟大教导，相信和依靠群众，相信和依靠解放军，相信和依靠干部的大多数。有的单位还邀请了贫农代表、红卫兵小将和有关单位的革命派战士共同参加战斗。在干部问题上，要敢于解放一大片，敢于让那些犯过错误、甚至是犯有严重错误的干部参加斗争会，鼓励和帮助他们站起来，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行短兵相接的揭发批判，让他们在火线亮相，火线立功，同时也使广大的革命群众更好地识别和考察干部，为革命的“三结合”打下基础。
    这次首都文艺界斗批党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的一个特点，就是放手发动了群众，比较充分地贯彻执行了群众路线。在这场人民战争中，首都文艺界的革命战士既敢于斗争，又善于斗争，运用了灵活机动的战略战术，采用了大、中、小会相结合的方法，“大会斗臭，小会斗透”，全面开花，交叉进行。有的单位还在会场内外举办了反革命修正主义分子罪恶家史和罪行展览、图片展览，放映有关毒草影片等，有力地配合了批判斗争。
    “战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”广大的文艺界无产阶级革命派战士通过这次斗争，深深地体会到战无不胜的毛泽东思想的这一伟大的真理。
    以阶级斗争为纲，狠斗狠批党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派
    毛主席教导我们，“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”十七年来，乃至三十多年来，陆定一、周扬、夏衍、林默涵、萧望东之流，在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的庇护和支持下，钻进文化艺术界，窃踞领导岗位，对无产阶级实行了资产阶级专政。他们极力推行一条资产阶级的文艺思想、现代修正主义的文艺思想和所谓三十年代文艺相结合的反革命修正主义文艺黑线，把文艺界搞得乌烟瘴气，毒草丛生，极力为在中国复辟资本主义做舆论准备。他们就是毛主席所指出的这样一批反革命的修正主义分子。文艺界的这场斗争，也是一场资产阶级复辟与无产阶级反复辟的你死我活的大搏斗，是一场在意识形态领域里的夺权斗争。
    中央音乐学院在斗争反革命修正主义分子周扬的时候，紧紧抓住了阶级斗争这个纲，从《赛金花》追到《海瑞罢官》，从三十年代的“国防文学”追到六十年代的“全民文艺”，准确地击中了周扬这个老牌反革命两面派的要害，狠狠地打击了敌人，戳穿了周扬一贯打着“红旗”反红旗的反革命手法和丑恶嘴脸。
    有些单位在大批判中，采用了忆苦思甜的方式来进行阶级教育，这也是推进革命的大批判、大斗争运动的有效方法。
    首都文艺界的无产阶级革命派深深感到，在对一小撮反革命修正主义分子进行大批判当中，必须时刻牢牢地抓住两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的纲，抓住了这个纲，就牵住了牛鼻子，抓住了中心，就可以透过复杂的现象看到本质；就可以抓住反革命修正主义分子的要害；就可以更加理解资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争的长期性，“如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的”；就可以更加深刻地理解巩固和加强无产阶级专政的重要性和无产阶级文化大革命的深远意义。
    毛泽东思想是革命的大批判大斗争的灵魂
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想，是我们向敌人作斗争的最锐利的武器。要从政治上、思想上、理论上、组织上把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，就必须把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位。正如林彪同志所说的：“要搞好这场文化大革命，靠什么呢？靠伟大的毛泽东思想，靠群众的智慧和力量”。首都文艺界的斗争实践雄辩地证明，毛泽东思想是革命的大批判的灵魂。离开了毛泽东思想，就寸步难行；掌握了毛泽东思想就所向无敌。
    敌人是异常狡猾的，他们都有多年的反革命经验，总想蒙混过关，伺机反扑。广大革命文艺战士通过斗争实践，发现这些牛鬼蛇神最害怕毛泽东思想。于是就进行充分的调查研究和火力侦察，狠狠抓住要害问题，用毛主席的指示同这一小撮反革命修正主义分子的言行作对比。这样，就使这一小撮反革命修正主义分子在毛泽东思想这面威力无比的照妖镜下，一个一个现出了丑恶的原形。
    在这场空前规模、空前深刻的大批判、大斗争中，文艺界的无产阶级革命派，牢记毛主席的教导：“革命战争是一种抗毒素，它不但将排除敌人的毒焰，也将清洗自己的污浊。”他们懂得，无产阶级文化大革命是一个用毛泽东思想教育人、改造人的伟大的思想革命运动。无产阶级革命派既要敢于向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派展开“白刃战”，也要敢于向自己头脑中的“私”字开火，狠触自己的灵魂，改造世界观。
    伟大领袖毛主席最近指出：必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。文艺界广大无产阶级革命派深深感到，大敌当前，如果让小团体主义、风头主义等非无产阶级思想继续发展下去，那就是犯罪。这样做，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派就无法斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，无产阶级文化大革命就有中途夭折的危险，我们的无产阶级专政就会被葬送，我们的社会主义江山就会改变颜色。他们说，我们一定要遵照林彪副主席的教导，必须“把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。”
    现实的阶级斗争使得广大革命文艺战士的心胸更加开阔，眼界更加宽广了。他们说得好：“我们绝不能为自己小团体争气，要为毛主席争气，为无产阶级争气！要做名副其实的毛主席的革命文艺战士！”
    首都文艺界的革命大批判运动方兴未艾。广大革命文艺战士，正以高昂的斗志，更高地举起革命的批判大旗，决心掀起大批判、大斗争的“狂飙”，把文艺界党内一小撮大大小小的走资本主义道路当权派斗倒，斗垮，斗臭！把被反革命修正主义文艺黑线所盘踞的一切文艺阵地通通夺回来！让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍文艺界！插遍全中国！插遍全世界！
