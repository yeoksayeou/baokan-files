    Gao Zhengguo wears the hat of a poor peasant, but his body and mind are not those of a poor peasant; they are truly those of a rich peasant. He hangs the sign of a poor peasant, speaks the words of a rich peasant, does the deeds of a rich peasant, and thinks like a rich peasant. His heart is completely different from ours, the poor and lower-middle peasants! He says: "The world must have both rich and poor." This is purely the talk of the exploiting class; all landlords and rich peasants say the same thing. He doesn't want "model workers," doesn't want "honor," and in reality, he doesn't want socialism but wants capitalism. Gao Zhengguo's "five-year plan" is a plan for exploitation by the rich peasants. He has no trace of a poor peasant. For money, he doesn't want to sell surplus grain and instead curses the party's procurement policy; for money, he is so stingy with his neighbors that even his son-in-law suffers his exploitation; to get rich, he bought Li Cun's land when the poor peasant was sick. How is this different from the exploitation by past landlords and rich peasants? He is determined to take the capitalist road, opposes agricultural cooperativization, and slanders cooperativization as "leftist one day, rightist the next" being against him. No wonder he is so close with Cat Whiskers, they are birds of a feather.

    The film director dressed Gao Zhengguo, this rich peasant element, as a "poor peasant" with malicious intent. On one hand, he is the artistic specimen of the "peasants also like to get rich" fallacy of the biggest capitalist-roader in the party; on the other hand, the director wants to use Gao Zhengguo to create an illusion: poor peasants are against cooperativization and do not want to take the socialist road, and the capitalist road not only serves the interests of capitalists and rich peasants but also serves the interests of "old poor peasants" like Gao Zhengguo. The film director uses the image of this so-called "old poor peasant" Gao Zhengguo to viciously attack agricultural cooperativization and blatantly advocate for "individual farming is good," which is extremely malicious! We must peel off Gao Zhengguo's "poor peasant" mask and expose his rich peasant essence in broad daylight!

　　剥开高正国“贫农”的画皮
　　北京四季青公社贫农  韩文晋
    高正国帽子是贫农，身子和脑袋可不是贫农，而是地地道道的富农。他挂的是贫农的招牌，说的是富农的话，干的是富农干的事，想的全是富农那一套。他的心跟咱贫下中农完全两样！他说：“世界上总得有穷有富”。这纯粹是剥削阶级的话，天下的地主富农都那么说的。他不要“劳模”，不要“光荣”，实际上是不要社会主义，而要资本主义。高正国的那个“五年计划”，就是富农的剥削计划，他压根儿没有贫农的气味。为了钱，他不愿卖余粮，反而破口大骂党的统购政策；为了钱，他对邻居那么刻薄，连女婿也受他的剥削；为了发家致富，他趁着贫农李存生病时买他的地。这跟过去地主富农剥削有什么不同？他一个心眼走资本主义道路，反对农业合作化，污蔑合作化是“左一下，右一下”跟他过不去。难怪他跟猫胡子勾勾搭搭，打得火热，他们本来就是一根藤上的瓜。
    影片编导者把高正国这个富农分子打扮成“贫农”，是有罪恶目的的。一方面，他是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的“农民也喜欢发财”谬论的艺术标本；另一方面编导者想借高正国来造成一种假象：贫农是反对合作化的，是不愿走社会主义道路的，资本主义道路不但符合资本家、富农的利益，而且也符合象高正国这样的“老贫农”的利益。影片编导者借高正国这个所谓“老贫农”的形象来恶毒地攻击农业合作化，明目张胆地鼓吹“单干好”，真是恶毒之极！我们一定要扒开高正国这个“贫农”的画皮，把他的富农本质暴露在光天化日之下！
