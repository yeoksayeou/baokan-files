Moroccan Cabinet Reshuffled, Benhima Appointed Prime Minister

Two U.S. Imperialist Planes Collide, Killing a Brigadier General

Two U.S. imperialist B-52 strategic bombers collided and crashed in the skies southeast of Saigon on July 6. Thirteen people on board the planes, including Brigadier General Kram of the U.S. Strategic Air Command's Third Air Force Division stationed in Guam, are missing.

According to Western news agencies, the two planes collided en route to a target in South Vietnam.

Sato Government Forcibly Passes Reactionary Bills

Despite strong opposition from the broad masses of the people, the Sato government launched a surprise attack during a late-night session of the House of Representatives' Cabinet Committee on July 6, forcibly passing the reactionary "Defense Agency Establishment Law Amendment Bill" and the "Self-Defense Forces Law Amendment Bill."

According to Japanese newspapers, the main content of the so-called "Defense Agency Establishment Law Amendment Bill" and "Self-Defense Forces Law Amendment Bill" is to increase the personnel strength of the "Defense Agency" (i.e., the Ministry of Defense) and the army, navy, and air force, as well as to increase the number of reserve officers. This is to meet the needs of U.S. imperialism's expansion of the war of aggression in Asia, including the procurement of helicopters, warships, and other equipment, and to accelerate the reorganization of Japan's air force and the establishment of a missile unit.
