One day, at a construction site in Tanzania, an old carpenter named Muhammad insisted that the Chinese expert working there write down his name, hoping to be the first to receive a shiny Mao Chairman badge. The old carpenter's love for Chairman Mao deeply moved the Chinese expert, who then took off his beloved Mao Chairman badge and gave it to him. The old carpenter was overjoyed, holding the badge with both hands and shouting, "Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong!" Some young workers heard this and immediately rushed over, gathering around the old carpenter to ask to see the Mao Chairman badge. Everyone eagerly wanted the old man to give the badge to them, saying, "Give this badge to me, we young people love Chairman Mao!" The old carpenter happily replied, "Chairman Mao is the great leader of all the people of the world, we all love Chairman Mao." Then, he pinned the Mao Chairman badge to his chest and let the young people pay their respects to the badge.

    老木工的喜悦
    有一天，在坦桑尼亚的一个建筑工地上，一位老木匠穆罕默德坚持要在那里工作的中国专家把他的名字记下来，希望能优先得到金光闪闪的毛主席像章。这位老木工热爱毛主席的心情，使中国专家深受感动，就把自己心爱的毛主席像章摘下来送给了他。老木工高兴极了，双手捧着像章高声欢呼：“毛泽东，毛泽东！”一些青年工人听到后，立即蜂拥而来，围着老木匠，请求瞧瞧毛主席像章。每个人都争着要这位老人把像章送给他，他们抢着说：“把这枚像章给我吧，我们青年人热爱毛主席！”老木匠愉快地回答说：“毛主席是全世界人民的伟大领袖，我们全都热爱毛主席。”接着，他把毛主席像章别在胸前，并让青年人向毛主席像章致敬。
