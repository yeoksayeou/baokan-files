The people's revolutionary masses, militia, Red Guards, and local troops of Dongxing County of All Nationalities in Guangxi held a protest meeting in the afternoon of July 12 to strongly protest against the war provocation by the U.S. imperialist bandit aircraft that intruded into our sacred airspace, fired missiles at our border defense troops in the western part of Dongxing County of All Nationalities, and injured our People's Liberation Army soldiers and destroyed houses. The military and civilian participants at the meeting were filled with indignation and repeatedly shouted slogans such as "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet modern revisionism!" "Down with all reactionaries in the world!" "Double the punishment for the U.S. aggressors!"

The military and civilian participants at the meeting, pointing to the houses destroyed by the U.S. air bandits, expressed their extreme anger, saying that this is another debt owed by U.S. imperialism to the Chinese people. They pointed out that the U.S. imperialism, which is in dire straits in the Vietnam War, in close collaboration with Soviet modern revisionism, is escalating the war while continuously dispatching military aircraft to intrude into our airspace to provoke war. This does not show its strength but rather exposes the paper tiger nature of U.S. imperialism being at its wits' end. We solemnly warn the U.S. imperialism that your war provocations will only be "lifting a rock to drop on your own feet" and will not end well. We will definitely bury all invaders and their running dogs in the world.

Military representative Deng Baijin said in his speech that the continuous victories of China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have frightened the U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and all reactionaries in the world to death. They are extremely afraid of and hate the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and are doing everything they can to sabotage and disrupt it. This afternoon, the U.S. bandit aircraft actually fired missiles at our sacred territory, injuring our four dear comrades. This is another blood debt owed by U.S. imperialism to the Chinese people. We strongly protest against this new war provocation by U.S. imperialism with great indignation. He said, the blood of our comrades will not be in vain. We will definitely settle this blood debt with U.S. imperialism. We will definitely counterattack and punish it doubly for its war provocations.

Militia instructor Lin Anquan, who immediately led more than 200 militia and civilians to the scene to rescue after the U.S. bandit aircraft fired missiles, angrily denounced the heinous crimes of U.S. imperialism. He said, we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions, grasp revolution, promote production, and strive for double victories in revolution and production. We must always be vigilant and forever stand with the People's Liberation Army to thoroughly, completely, and utterly annihilate all enemies who dare to invade, defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and defend the ironclad mountains and rivers of the proletariat.

The Red Guards representative said, if the U.S. imperialism dares to continue to make trouble and provoke, we will definitely smash the U.S. aggressors to pieces.

The poor and lower-middle peasants representative said, when I saw with my own eyes the U.S. air bandits firing missiles near our brigade, injuring our comrades-in-arms, and destroying our houses, I was so angry that my lungs almost burst. We poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and support the People's Liberation Army in seizing revolution and promoting war preparedness with practical actions, and strongly support the Vietnamese people's just struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

    广西东兴各族自治县军民举行声讨大会
    最强烈抗议美机对我进行战争挑衅
    据新华社南宁十三日电　广西东兴各族自治县的革命群众、民兵、红卫兵小将和当地驻军十二日下午举行声讨大会，最强烈抗议美帝国主义强盗飞机侵入我国神圣领空进行战争挑衅，在东兴各族自治县西部地区上空，向我边防部队发射导弹，打伤我人民解放军战士和炸毁房屋的滔天罪行。到会军民义愤填膺，不断振臂高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”
  “打倒苏联现代修正主义！”“打倒各国反动派！”
  “加倍惩罚美国侵略者！”
    参加大会的军民指着被美国空中强盗炸毁的房屋无比愤怒地说，这是美帝国主义对中国人民欠下的又一笔债。他们指出，在侵越战争中陷于绝境的美帝国主义在苏联现代修正主义的紧密配合下，在加紧进行战争“升级”的同时，不断地派遣军用飞机侵入我国领空进行战争挑衅，这并不说明它的强大，恰恰暴露了美帝国主义走投无路的纸老虎本相。我们严正警告美帝国主义，你们的战争挑衅，只会是“搬起石头打自己的脚”，决不会有好下场。我们一定要把世界上一切侵略者及其走狗，通通埋葬掉。
    驻军代表邓八金在讲话中说，我国无产阶级文化大革命的节节胜利，吓破了美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派的胆。他们对中国的无产阶级文化大革命怕得要死，恨得要命，千方百计地从事破坏和捣乱。今天下午，美国强盗飞机竟然向我国神圣领土发射导弹，炸伤我们四位亲爱的战友，这是美帝国主义欠下中国人民的又一笔血债。我们怀着无比愤怒的心情，最强烈抗议美帝国主义对我国进行的这一新的战争挑衅罪行。他说，我们战友的血不会白流，我们一定要向美帝国主义清算这笔血债。对美帝国主义的战争挑衅，我们一定坚决回击，加倍惩罚。
    在美国强盗飞机发射导弹后立即率领二百多名民兵、群众赶到现场抢救的民兵教导员林安权愤怒声讨美帝国主义的滔天罪行。他说，我们一定要按照毛主席的教导，狠抓革命，猛促生产，誓夺革命、生产双胜利。时刻提高警惕，永远和人民解放军在一起，坚决、彻底、干净、全部地消灭一切敢于来犯的敌人，保卫无产阶级文化大革命，保卫无产阶级铁打的江山。
    红卫兵代表说，美帝国主义胆敢继续捣乱、挑衅，我们一定要把美国侵略者打得稀巴烂。
    贫下中农社员代表说，当我亲眼看到美国空中强盗向我大队附近发射导弹，打伤我们的子弟兵，炸毁我们的房屋时，我的肺都气炸了。我们贫下中农最听毛主席的话，用实际行动支援人民解放军抓革命，促战备，大力支援越南人民抗美救国的正义斗争。
