The great leader's greatest concern and encouragement for red diplomats

Our country sends a special plane to bring back the remains of the martyr and the injured comrades

Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, June 30th: The remains of Liu Yi, our expert in Myanmar who was killed by thugs incited by the reactionary Myanmar government, were brought back to Kunming by a special plane sent by our government this afternoon; Cao Dalin and Zhang Ruijun, our messengers who were injured, also returned to Kunming on this plane.

Today, more than 800 people, including responsible officials from the Chinese People's Liberation Army in Kunming, revolutionary cadres of the proletariat in the Kunming region, Red Guards, soldiers of the Liberation Army, returned overseas Chinese, and responsible officials from relevant departments, went to the airport to welcome them. They angrily denounced the heinous crimes of the Myanmar government in inciting and allowing thugs to repeatedly attack our embassy, kill our experts, and persecute and massacre our compatriots; they enthusiastically supported our government's statement on the 29th.

The two messengers who returned in glory, holding high a portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao and waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," stepped off the plane. They excitedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!". Red Guards and soldiers of the Liberation Army rushed forward to warmly console them and presented them with Chairman Mao badges, quotations from Chairman Mao, and Red Guard armbands.

When people saw the remains of Liu Yi, who bravely sacrificed himself in the fight against Myanmar thugs, they were extremely angry and repeatedly shouted, "Down with the Myanmar reactionaries!" "Strongly protest the heinous crimes of the Myanmar reactionary government in following the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists in their mad anti-China and anti-Chinese policies!"

Today, those who came to the airport to welcome the return also included Li Feng, the acting consul and vice consul of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's Consulate General in Kunming.

Xinhua News Agency, Yangon, June 30th: On the 30th, the Chinese government sent a special plane to Yangon to bring back the remains of Liu Yi, a Chinese expert who bravely sacrificed himself in the struggle against the fascist crimes of thugs incited and directed by the reactionary Myanmar government to attack the Chinese Embassy on the 28th, and the injured comrades Cao Dalin and Zhang Ruijun. All Chinese workers in Yangon unanimously regarded this as the greatest concern and encouragement from the great leader Chairman Mao for all Chinese workers who are bravely fighting against the anti-China fascist atrocities of the Myanmar reactionary government. All Chinese workers repeatedly shouted, "Long live the reddest red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

At 10:50 AM on the 30th, all Chinese workers in Yangon wore black armbands and held a solemn ceremony to bid farewell to the remains of Liu Yi. All Chinese workers angrily denounced and accused the wild and mad anti-China atrocities of the Myanmar reactionary government, shouting, "Strongest protest against the fascist crimes of the Myanmar reactionary government!" "The Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with!" "Anti-China will not end well!" "Blood debts must be repaid with blood!" They also collectively read quotations from Chairman Mao and expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao's great teachings of "Resolutely deciding to overcome all difficulties and strive for victory" to fight against the Myanmar reactionary government.

The remains of Liu Yi were cremated in Yangon in the morning of the 30th. Before sending his remains to the crematorium, all Chinese workers in Yangon gathered at the Chinese Embassy, in front of the Myanmar military that was still surrounding the Chinese Embassy, loudly read quotations from Chairman Mao, shouted slogans, and sang "The Internationale" to mourn Liu Yi.

The hearse, escorted by Acting Charge d'Affaires Xiao Ming and other Chinese workers in Yangon, left the embassy at 11:10 AM and headed to the airport. The special plane took off from Yangon Airport at 12:30 PM.
