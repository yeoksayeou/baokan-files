With Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive as the highest guideline, Shanghai university students and teachers are determined to launch a wave of resuming classes and making revolution. Broad revolutionary students and teachers say: Resuming classes and making revolution is the necessary path to deeply carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in colleges and universities, and is the starting point for initiating a new high tide of educational revolution.

According to Xinhua News Agency Shanghai, July 11th, after the news of the revolutionary students and teachers of Beijing Aviation Institute resuming classes and making revolution was published, it sparked a strong response among the broad Red Guards and revolutionary students and teachers in Shanghai's universities. They are determined to take the revolutionary students and teachers of Beijing Aviation Institute as an example and become the vanguard of resuming classes and making revolution.

On the morning of the 5th, after the revolutionary students and teachers of Shanghai's universities heard the news of Beijing Aviation Institute resuming classes and making revolution, they immediately posted large banners in the campus saying "Learn from the Red Flag comrades of Beihang," "Follow Chairman Mao, resume classes and make revolution." Fudan University held a mobilization meeting for resuming classes and making revolution on the same day. The revolutionary students and teachers of Tongji University also held a school-wide connection meeting in the morning to have a heated discussion on the issue of the school resuming classes and making revolution. The revolutionary young fighters of East China Normal University, Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and Shanghai Mechanical and Electrical Engineering Institute all held oath-taking meetings for resuming classes and making revolution.

Many Red Guards and revolutionary students and teachers in Shanghai's colleges and universities, after seriously studying the advanced experience of Beijing Aviation Institute, said: Resuming classes and making revolution, this is the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, and it is a major issue concerning whether we can carry out the Cultural Revolution in colleges and universities to the end. At this crucial moment of the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, it is of special importance for colleges and universities to carry out the resumption of classes and making revolution. It will greatly promote and further consolidate revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination"; it is beneficial to improve the proletarian revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of the revolutionary ranks, and guide the petty-bourgeois ideology onto the track of proletarian revolution; it is beneficial to fully mobilize the revolutionary students and teachers of colleges and universities, fight a people's war, thoroughly smash the revisionist educational line, thoroughly smash the bourgeois educational system, teaching principles, and methods, and establish Chairman Mao's revolutionary educational line, establish the proletarian educational system, teaching principles, and methods. In a word, it is the necessary path to deeply carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation in colleges and universities, and is the starting point for initiating a new high tide of educational revolution.

Many revolutionary students and teachers in Shanghai's colleges and universities believe that the revolutionary students and teachers of Beihang proposed that Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive is the highest guideline for resuming classes and making revolution, and that learning industry, agriculture, military, and some professional knowledge is the teaching content of resuming classes and making revolution. Currently, the focus is on criticism, and later it will gradually transition to "learning as the main focus." Beihang's experience points out the direction for the progress of colleges and universities resuming classes and making revolution, and has initially explored the path forward, which is worth our serious study. They also believe that resuming classes and making revolution is a new thing, and there is no precedent. We must dare to practice and create bravely, and we will definitely open up a broad road.

Now, many revolutionary students and teachers in Shanghai's colleges and universities have taken active action. Tongji University, Shanghai Fisheries University, and Shanghai University of Traditional Chinese Medicine have already started resuming classes and making revolution on the 10th. Fudan University and East China Normal University have already started trial points in some departments or classes, and some classes have already drawn up preliminary plans and arrangements for resuming classes and making revolution.

    以毛主席“五·七”指示为最高纲领，作教育革命的探索者
    上海高校师生决心掀起复课闹革命热潮
    广大革命师生说：复课闹革命是深入开展大专院校斗、批、改的必由之路，是掀起教育革命新高潮的起点。
    据新华社上海十一日电　北京航空学院革命师生复课闹革命的消息发表以后，在上海高等院校广大红卫兵小将和革命师生中引起强烈的反响。他们决心以北京航空学院革命师生为榜样，作复课闹革命的先锋。
    五日清晨，上海高等院校的广大革命师生听到北京航空学院复课闹革命的消息后，立即在校园里贴出“向北航红旗战友学习”、“紧跟毛主席，复课闹革命”的大标语。复旦大学，当天就召开了复课闹革命的动员大会。同济大学革命师生，也在当天上午召开了一个全校性的串连会，对学校复课闹革命问题展开热烈的讨论。华东师范大学、上海中医学院、上海机械学院等院校的革命小将，都举行了复课闹革命的誓师大会。
    上海大专院校的许多红卫兵小将和革命师生在认真学习北京航空学院的先进经验以后说：复课闹革命，这是伟大领袖毛主席的号召，是关系到能不能把大专院校无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的大事。在当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的决战时刻，大专院校开展复课闹革命具有特别重大的意义，它必将大大促进和进一步巩固革命大联合和革命的“三结合”；有利于提高革命队伍的无产阶级革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，把小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道；有利于把大专院校的革命师生最充分地动员起来，打一场人民战争，大破修正主义的教育路线，大破资产阶级教育制度、教学方针和方法，大立毛主席的革命教育路线，大立无产阶级教育制度、教学方针和方法。一句话，它是深入开展大专院校斗、批、改的必由之路，是掀起教育革命新高潮的起点。
    上海大专院校的许多革命师生认为，北航革命师生提出，毛主席的“五·七”指示是复课闹革命的最高纲领，学工、学农、学军、学一些专业知识是复课闹革命的教学内容，当前先以大批判为主，以后逐步过渡到“以学为主”。北航的这一经验为高等院校复课闹革命指出了前进的方向，初步摸索出了前进的道路，这是值得我们认真学习的。他们还认为，复课闹革命是新事物，是没有前人经验的。我们一定要大胆实践，勇敢创造，这样一定能闯出一条康庄大道来。
    现在，上海许多大专院校的革命师生已经积极行动起来。同济大学、上海市水产学院、上海中医学院等十日已经开始复课闹革命，复旦大学、华东师范大学等已经在一些系科或班级着手试点，有的班级已经订出复课闹革命的初步计划和安排。
