Recently, we inspected the reserves of some production brigades and found that the majority of the brigades have their granaries cleaned thoroughly, with no signs of rodent damage or insect infestation, and no moldy or spoiled grain. However, some brigades have not managed their grain well. Some storage facilities lack doors and windows, some have not been cleaned and disinfected, and some store grain together with pesticides, resulting in unnecessary losses.

Currently, it is the peak of the rainy season, and grain is most susceptible to damage. We suggest that all brigades take this opportunity, as summer grain is being stored, to thoroughly inspect the storage conditions of their reserves and take effective measures to ensure that not a single grain is lost.

　　多雨季节，储备粮管好了吗？
    最近，我们检查了一些生产队的储备粮，发现多数生产队的粮仓打扫得干干净净，既无鼠咬虫蛀的现象，也没有霉坏变质的情况。但是也有一部分生产队，粮食管理得不够好，有的仓库缺门少窗，有的未清仓消毒，有的将粮食和农药放在一起，因而受到了一些不应有的损失。
    现在正是盛夏多雨季节，粮食最容易损坏。建议各地生产队趁夏粮入仓的时候，认真地细致地检查一次储备粮的保管情况，并采取有效措施，努力做到不损坏一粒粮。
