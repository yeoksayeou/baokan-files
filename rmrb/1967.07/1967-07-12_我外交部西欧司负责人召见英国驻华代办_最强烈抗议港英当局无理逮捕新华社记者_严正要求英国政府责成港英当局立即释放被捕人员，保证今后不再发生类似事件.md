The responsible official of the West Europe Division of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs summoned the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, Hopkinson, this evening to lodge the strongest protest against the unreasonable arrest of a Xinhua News Agency reporter by the British authorities in Hong Kong and their continuous provocations and harassment of Xinhua staff.

The protest stated that Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch reporter Xue Ping was unreasonably arrested by armed police of the British authorities in Hong Kong while conducting normal interviews near Wan Chai Road at 1:40 AM today. Despite showing his Xinhua News Agency press pass, Xue Ping was forcibly taken away by the Hong Kong police and detained at the Eastern District Police Station. Subsequently, the responsible official of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch had repeatedly negotiated with the British authorities in Hong Kong over this matter. At 6:00 AM today, Liang Weilin, the head of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, also lodged the strongest and most urgent protest to the "Acting Governor" of Hong Kong, Chichester-Clark, and made three demands. However, the British authorities in Hong Kong continued to detain Xue Ping without any reason. We fully support Liang Weilin's just demands.

The British authorities in Hong Kong have not been the first to openly provoke and harass the staff of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch in this manner. As early as June 25, the deputy editor-in-chief of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, Wang Lei, and reporters Chen Guorong and Chen Mingzhu were also subjected to unreasonable obstruction and humiliating searches by armed police of the British authorities in Hong Kong.

The British authorities in Hong Kong have repeatedly and unreasonably interfered with the normal activities of the staff of the Chinese national news agency, threatened their personal safety, and made unreasonable arrests. This is another serious political provocation by the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong against the Chinese people. The Chinese government strongly protests against this. The British government must order the British authorities in Hong Kong to immediately release the detained personnel, publicly apologize to the detained personnel, and guarantee the freedom of activity and personal safety of the staff of the Hong Kong Branch and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again. Otherwise, all serious consequences arising from this will be borne by your side.

    我外交部西欧司负责人召见英国驻华代办
    最强烈抗议港英当局无理逮捕新华社记者
    严正要求英国政府责成港英当局立即释放被捕人员，保证今后不再发生类似事件
    新华社十一日讯　我国外交部西欧司负责人今晚召见英国驻华代办霍普森，就港英当局无理逮捕新华社香港分社记者薛平以及不断对分社工作人员进行挑衅和迫害，提出最强烈的抗议。
    抗议说，新华社香港分社记者薛平今晨一时四十分在香港湾仔道附近进行正常采访时，竟遭香港英国当局的武装警察无理逮捕。薛平虽然当时出示了新华社记者证件，但港英警察仍把他强挟上车，开往东区警署，扣押起来。事后，新华社香港分社负责人曾就此事数次向香港英国当局交涉。今晨六时，新华社香港分社社长梁威林又曾向香港“代理总督”祁济时提出最紧急最强烈抗议和三项要求，但香港英国当局却仍然毫无理由地继续扣押薛平。我们完全支持梁威林的严正要求。
    香港英国当局对新华社香港分社工作人员这样明目张胆地进行挑衅和迫害，已不是第一次。早在六月二十五日新华社香港分社副总编辑王磊和记者陈国荣、陈明珠等都曾遭受香港英国当局武装警察的无理阻拦和侮辱性的搜查。
    香港英国当局这样接二连三地无理干涉中国国家通讯社工作人员的正常活动，威胁他们的人身安全，对他们进行无理逮捕，这是英国政府和香港英国当局对中国人民的又一次严重政治挑衅。中国政府对此提出最强烈抗议。英国政府必须责成香港英国当局立即释放被捕人员；公开向被捕人员道歉；保证香港分社工作人员的活动自由、人身安全和今后不再发生类似事件。否则，由此而产生的一切严重后果，均由你方承担。
