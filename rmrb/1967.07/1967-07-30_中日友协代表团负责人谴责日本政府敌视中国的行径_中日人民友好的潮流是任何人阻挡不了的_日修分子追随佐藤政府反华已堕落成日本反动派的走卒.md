The representatives of the China-Japan Friendship Association's delegation to Japan today gave a statement to the Xinhua News Agency, strongly condemning the Sato government's hostility towards China and its deliberate sabotage of the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan. They also condemned the Sato government's repeated delays in issuing entry visas to the delegation, obstructing the delegation's visit to Japan.

The delegation's representative said: The China-Japan Friendship Association's delegation to Japan, consisting of 17 people, was invited by the headquarters of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) to visit Japan in late June to participate in the national conference of the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) in Tokyo and to conduct friendly visits. This fully aligns with the common aspirations of the peoples of China and Japan to strengthen friendship and solidarity. However, the Sato government has ignored the common aspirations of the peoples of China and Japan, created various excuses, and repeatedly delayed issuing entry visas to our delegation, obstructing our delegation's entry. This is a blatant act of hostility towards China and a deliberate sabotage of the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan. We are extremely indignant and strongly protest against this.

The delegation's representative said: Over the years, the China-Japan Friendship Association and the Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) have consistently worked to promote friendship between China and Japan by sending friendly delegations and conducting various beneficial activities for the peoples of both countries. Especially in the struggle against our common enemy, American imperialism, the peoples of both countries have established deep combat friendship, making the China-Japan friendship movement an irresistible trend today. This time, our delegation, in the midst of the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will visit Japan, bringing the friendship of the Chinese people to the Japanese people, and contribute to promoting mutual understanding and solidarity between the peoples of the two countries. The Japan-China Friendship Association (orthodox) and friends from various circles in Japan also share the same aspirations and have made great efforts to realize our delegation's visit to Japan, continuously struggling against the Sato government. We express our heartfelt thanks for this.

The delegation's representative pointed out: The Sato government's obstruction of our delegation's entry is inseparable from its series of anti-China conspiracies in recent times. In late June, Sato personally rushed to South Korea to hold a meeting in Seoul with American imperialists and the leaders of the Chiang Kai-shek clique. In early July, he sent Foreign Minister Miki to Bangkok, Thailand, to participate in the so-called Asia-Pacific Ministers' Conference. Sato even decided to visit Taiwan, colluding with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, who have been spit upon by the Chinese people, and actively assisting the United States in plotting an anti-China alliance in East Asia. This is part of the current anti-China conspiracies of the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries. They are now so fiercely anti-China because they are extremely afraid of the great power of Mao Zedong Thought and the strong influence of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Japanese reactionaries, who actively follow American imperialism and collude with the Soviet revisionist leadership, are engaging in anti-China activities and will not end well. In the end, they will inevitably "lift a rock only to drop it on their own feet."

The delegation's representative said: In the issue of obstructing our delegation's visit to Japan, the Japanese Communist Party revisionists played a very disgraceful role. As soon as our association decided to send a delegation to Japan, the Japanese revisionists immediately slandered and attacked our delegation and actively colluded with the Japanese reactionaries to sabotage our delegation's visit to Japan. This further exposed the traitorous nature of the Japanese revisionists, who have become lackeys of the Japanese reactionaries.

The delegation's representative finally firmly stated: The 700 million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will never allow the Sato government's conspiracies of hostility towards China and sabotage of the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan to succeed. We are confident that the Japanese people will fight to the end against the Sato government's reactionary policy of hostility towards China.

    中日友协代表团负责人谴责日本政府敌视中国的行径
    中日人民友好的潮流是任何人阻挡不了的
    日修分子追随佐藤政府反华已堕落成日本反动派的走卒
    新华社二十六日讯　中日友协访日代表团负责人，今天向新华社记者发表谈话，强烈谴责日本佐藤政府敌视中国、蓄意破坏中日两国人民的友谊，一再拖延不发给我代表团入境签证，阻挠我代表团访日的卑鄙行径。
    代表团负责人说：中日友协访日代表团一行十七人应日中友协（正统）本部的邀请，原定于六月下旬赴日，参加在东京举行的日中友协（正统）全国大会，并进行友好访问。这完全是符合中日两国人民加强友好团结的共同愿望的。但是，佐藤政府竟然无视中日两国人民的共同愿望，制造种种借口，一再拖延，至今不发给我代表团入境签证，阻挠我代表团入境，这是公然敌视中国，蓄意破坏中日两国人民友谊的卑鄙行径。对此，我们感到万分愤慨并提出强烈抗议。
    代表团负责人说：多年来，中日友协和日中友协（正统）一贯为了促进中日友好事业而互派友好代表团访问等，做了许多有益于两国人民的工作。特别是在反对共同敌人美帝国主义的斗争中，两国人民建立了深厚的战斗友谊，使中日友好运动成为当前不可阻挡的潮流。这次我代表团在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中访问日本，将带着中国人民对日本人民的友谊，为促进两国人民的相互了解、相互团结贡献一份力量。日中友协
  （正统）和日本各界朋友也抱着同样的愿望，为实现我代表团的访日作了许多努力，同佐藤政府进行了不断的斗争。对此，我们表示衷心的感谢。
    代表团负责人指出：佐藤政府阻挠我代表团入境，这是和它最近时期的一系列反华阴谋活动分不开的。佐藤六月底亲自跑到南朝鲜同美帝和蒋帮头目举行汉城会谈，七月初又派外相三木到泰国曼谷参加所谓亚洲太平洋国家部长会议，佐藤甚至悍然决定要访问台湾，同已被中国人民唾弃的蒋帮勾结，积极协助美国策划东亚反华同盟。这是目前帝、修、反整个反华阴谋活动的一个组成部分。现在他们之所以大肆反华，是因为他们非常害怕毛泽东思想的伟大威力和我国无产阶级文化大革命的强烈影响。日本反动派积极追随美帝国主义，并与苏联修正主义领导集团勾搭，大搞反华，是绝不会有好下场的，到头来必然是“搬起石头打自己的脚”。
    代表团负责人说：在阻挠我代表团访日问题上，日共修正主义分子扮演了极不光彩的角色，当我友协决定派代表团访日，日修马上大肆诬蔑和攻击我代表团，并积极勾结日本反动派，破坏我代表团访日。这就更加暴露了日修的叛徒嘴脸，日修已经堕落为日本反动派的走卒。
    代表团负责人最后坚决表示：用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，绝不容许佐藤政府敌视中国、破坏中日两国人民友谊的任何阴谋得逞。我们深信，日本人民将会同佐藤政府敌视中国的反动政策斗争到底。
