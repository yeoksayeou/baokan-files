Kenyan Government Irrationally Demands Chinese Chargé d'Affaires to Leave, Severely Worsening Bilateral Relations
China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs Strongly Protests to Kenyan Government
Declares Kenyan Chargé d'Affaires Persona Non Grata and Orders Him to Leave Within 48 Hours

	New China News Agency, July 1st: On July 1st, Dong Yueqian, Assistant Minister of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, summoned the Chargé d'Affaires of the Kenyan Embassy in China, Ms. Maysa, and handed her a note of protest from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The Chinese government, in the note, strongly protested the Kenyan government's irrational decision to declare the Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Kenya, Li Jie, as "persona non grata" and to order him to leave Kenya within 48 hours. The Chinese government also declared the Chargé d'Affaires of the Kenyan Embassy in China, Ms. Maysa, as "persona non grata" and ordered her to leave China within 48 hours starting from July 2nd, 1967, at 00:00. The full text of the note from the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is as follows:

	To the Embassy of the Republic of Kenya in China:

	On June 29, 1967, the government of the Republic of Kenya irrationally declared the Chargé d'Affaires of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Kenya, Li Jie, as "persona non grata" and ordered him to leave Kenya within 48 hours. This is a highly serious step taken by the Kenyan government to deliberately sabotage the relations between China and Kenya. The Chinese people are extremely indignant, and the Chinese government strongly protests to the Kenyan government. The Chinese government also declares the Chargé d'Affaires of the Embassy of the Republic of Kenya in China, Ms. Maysa, as "persona non grata" and orders her to leave China within 48 hours starting from July 2, 1967, at 00:00.

	The Kenyan government, in an attempt to create this serious incident that severely damages the relations between the two countries, falsely claimed that the embassy violated diplomatic conventions, directly attacked the Kenyan government, and interfered in Kenyan internal affairs, etc. This is a complete distortion of facts and cannot stand scrutiny! The fact is that Mr. Mboya maliciously equated the People's Republic of China, which has always firmly opposed imperialism, with the aggressive United States in his speech in parliament, and maliciously slandered China. The Chinese Embassy wrote letters to the "East African Standard" and the "Daily Nation," which published Mr. Mboya's speech, to clarify the facts, which is completely justified and beyond reproach.

	The Kenyan government's attempt to shift the blame for sabotaging the relations between China and Kenya onto us is doomed to fail. On the contrary, over the past few years, the Kenyan government has done many things to sabotage the relations between the two countries. Some ministers of the Kenyan government have publicly opposed China on many occasions, viciously attacked the domestic and foreign policies of the Chinese government, and even personally attacked the Chinese Premier. The Kenyan government has already expelled Chinese personnel four times without justification. The Kenyan government has also allowed thugs to smash the newsstand of the Chinese Embassy five times, seriously infringing upon the privileges of the Chinese Embassy. Meanwhile, the Chinese government and the Chinese people have always made efforts to strengthen the unity of Asian and African peoples against imperialism and to maintain the friendship between the peoples of China and Kenya, which is well-known to all.

	Currently, U.S. and British imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism are frantically engaging in anti-China activities. They have already been strongly opposed by the people of the world. Those who engage in anti-China activities will not have a good ending. The Kenyan government's current actions to severely sabotage the relations between the two countries are exactly what imperialism and modern revisionism need, which goes against the interests of the Kenyan people and the people of Africa, and damages the cause of Asian and African peoples' unity against imperialism. The friendship between the peoples of China and Kenya cannot be destroyed by anyone. If the Kenyan government follows imperialism and insists on sabotaging the relations between the two countries, all the consequences that arise from this must be borne by the Kenyan government.

	Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China, July 1, 1967.

　　肯尼亚政府无理要求我代办离境肆意恶化两国关系
　　我外交部向肯尼亚政府提出最强烈抗议
　　宣布肯驻华临时代办为不受欢迎的人并限令四十八小时内出境
    新华社一日讯　中国外交部部长助理董越千一日召见肯尼亚驻华大使馆临时代办玛依莎，向他提交了一份中国外交部的抗议照会。中国政府在照会中就肯尼亚政府无理宣布中国驻肯尼亚大使馆临时代办李颉为“不受欢迎的人”，限他在四十八小时内离开肯尼亚一事，向肯尼亚政府提出最强烈的抗议，并宣布肯尼亚驻华大使馆临时代办玛依莎为不受欢迎的人，限他在四十八小时内离开中国。中国外交部照会全文如下：肯尼亚共和国驻华大使馆：
    一九六七年六月二十九日，肯尼亚共和国政府无理宣布中华人民共和国驻肯尼亚大使馆临时代办李颉为“不受欢迎的人”，限他在四十八小时内离开肯尼亚。这是肯尼亚政府肆意破坏中肯两国关系的一个极其严重的步骤。对此，中国人民极为愤慨，中国政府向肯尼亚政府提出最强烈的抗议，并且宣布肯尼亚驻中国大使馆临时代办玛依莎为不受欢迎的人，限他自一九六七年七月二日零时起四十八小时内离开中国。
    肯尼亚政府为了制造这一严重恶化两国关系的事件，胡说什么大使馆破坏了外交惯例，对肯尼亚政府进行了直接攻击，干涉了肯尼亚内政，等等。这完全是颠倒是非，是根本站不住脚的！事实是，姆博亚先生别有用心地在议会上把一贯坚决反对帝国主义的中华人民共和国同侵略成性的美帝国主义相提并论，恶毒诬蔑中国。中国大使馆写信给登载姆博亚讲话的《东非旗帜报》和《民族日报》以澄清是非，这是完全正当和无可非议的。
    肯尼亚政府妄图把破坏中肯两国关系的罪名扣到我们头上是办不到的。事实恰恰相反，几年以来，肯尼亚政府干了许多破坏两国关系的坏事。肯尼亚政府的一些部长多次公开反华，恶毒攻击中国政府的内外政策，甚至对中国总理进行人身攻击。肯尼亚政府至今已先后四次无理驱逐中国人员。肯尼亚政府还纵容暴徒五次砸毁了中国大使馆的新闻橱窗，严重地侵犯了中国大使馆的特权。而中国政府和中国人民一贯为加强亚非人民团结反帝事业和维护中肯两国人民友谊而尽自己的努力，这是有目共睹，众所周知的。
    目前，美英帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义正在疯狂地反华。他们已遭到世界人民的强烈反对。反华的人是没有好下场的。肯尼亚政府目前所采取的严重破坏两国关系的行动，正好适应帝国主义和现代修正主义的需要，违背了肯尼亚人民和非洲人民的利益，损害了亚非人民团结反帝的事业。中肯两国人民的友谊是任何人也破坏不了的。如果肯尼亚政府追随帝国主义，一意孤行，继续破坏两国关系，由此而产生的一切后果，必须由肯尼亚政府负责。
