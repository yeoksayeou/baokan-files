The Socialist Path Is Set!

Liu Yonghe

	When I think of the old society, I grind my teeth in hatred. Back then, the sky belonged to the landlords, the land belonged to the landlords, and we poor people had no roof to shelter us and no land to stand on. I started working for a cruel and stingy landlord, known as "Trash Can," at the age of thirteen until liberation. I endured twenty years in this landlord's house, which was like a den of cannibals! This landlord would collect two or three hundred dan of grain a year, but only thirty dan would be divided among the seven hired laborers. By autumn, he would come up with all sorts of tricks, deducting here and there, leaving the seven laborers with empty hands. At that time, my five brothers were all working outside, but no matter how hard we toiled, by the end of the year, two elderly people and a little sister still struggled to eat even coarse grains. Five young, strong men worked like oxen and horses all year round, endured all kinds of hardships, but couldn't even fill three mouths. What kind of world was that! The top capitalist-roader in the Party advocates "individual farming," saying that "exploitation is beneficial." The result of "individual farming" in the old society for thousands of years is that a small handful of lazy, ignorant people become filthy rich, while the broad masses of laboring people are impoverished. "Individual farming" is the path to death for the poor, exploitation is a grave sin!

	The twenty years of blood and tears before liberation and the twelve years of happiness since the cooperative movement have made me fully understand that "individual farming" is the root of bitterness. Chairman Mao teaches us that doing so would make the peasants "permanently poor and miserable." "Apart from socialism, there is no other way out." We poor and lower-middle peasants will follow Chairman Mao and walk the socialist path. Only by following Chairman Mao's words and the path he points out can our country prosper year after year and remain red for generations.

    社会主义道路走定了！
    刘永河
    提起旧社会，我恨的咬牙根。那时，天是地主的天，地是地主的地，咱们穷人上无片瓦遮身体，下无半分立足地。我从十三岁就到一个歹毒刻薄的被人叫做“锅房”的地主家扛活，一直到解放。在这个吃人肉喝人血的地主家里，整整熬了二十年！这个地主一年收二三百石粮，分到七个长工名下的才只有三二十石。到了秋后，他又打鬼主意，七折八扣，七个长工竟落得个两手攥空拳。那时候，我弟兄五个都在外边卖命，可是拚死拚活地干了一年，到头来两个老人和一个小妹妹还是吃糠咽菜都难哪！五个年轻力壮的小伙子，一年到头出尽了牛马力，受尽了人间苦，连三张口都糊不住，那叫什么世道！党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派鼓吹“单干”，说什么“剥削有功”。几千年的旧社会搞“单干”的结果，就是一小撮四体不勤、五谷不分的坏人富得发昏，广大劳动人民穷得要命。“单干”是穷人的死路一条，剥削有罪，罪大恶极！
    解放前二十年的血泪史，合作化以来十二年走过的幸福路，使我完完全全懂得了搞“单干”就是保苦根。毛主席教导我们说，那样办就要“使农民自己陷于永远的穷苦”。“除了社会主义，再无别的出路”。我们贫下中农跟毛主席跟定了，走社会主义道路走定了。只有听毛主席的话，走毛主席指引的道路，我们国家才能年年兴，万代红。
