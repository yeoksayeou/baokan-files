The troops of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Wuhan, including the army, navy, and air force, have issued a joint pledge. The People's Liberation Army, founded by Chairman Mao and commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, resolutely supports the revolutionary leftists in striking at their common enemy.

In the midst of the triumphant songs of victory as the nation pursues and strikes down the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents in Wuhan, the broad masses of soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Wuhan have been holding meetings and discussions. They have sworn with great enthusiasm to Chairman Mao: The People's Liberation Army, founded by Chairman Mao and commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, lives to carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and dies to defend it. To carry out and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and to support the proletarian revolutionary leftists, they are ready to face any danger. They have expressed their firm determination to raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, to fully and unconditionally support the proletarian revolutionary leftists in Wuhan, and to join them in striking down the Chinese Khrushchov and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the military in Wuhan, pushing the proletarian cultural revolution in Wuhan to a new stage of victory.

	At crucial moments, we must stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	Comrade Lan Qingxiang, a company commander, said: Mao Zedong Thought is the lifeline of the proletariat and the working people. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line represents the interests of the broad masses of workers and peasants. Chairman Mao's words are the absolute truth. The heavens and the earth are not as great as Chairman Mao's grace, and the rivers and seas are not as deep as Chairman Mao's grace. Anyone who dares to oppose Chairman Mao, Mao Zedong Thought, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is our sworn enemy, and we will fight them to the end. The proletarian revolutionary leftists have unlimited love for Chairman Mao, unlimited faith in Mao Zedong Thought, and unlimited loyalty to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In times of hardship, they have bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Their greatest virtue is their loyalty to and bravery in defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line! In the struggle, I have deeply realized that whoever opposes the proletarian revolutionary leftists is opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. With such a belief, one can stand firmly with the proletarian revolutionary leftists in any situation.

	Comrade Fan Yumei, a political instructor, said: Only by establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds can we stand firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in the decisive battle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. Chairman Mao's words are the highest and most powerful, every sentence is the truth, and one sentence is worth ten thousand. We must resolutely carry out Chairman Mao's instructions. An important sign of whether we have established the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in our minds is whether we can carry out Chairman Mao's instructions without any deviation at crucial moments. Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line represents the interests of the broad masses of workers and peasants and the direction of the world's progress. It is the red "public" line and the guarantee of revolutionary victory. At crucial moments, only by standing firmly on the side of the Party and the masses and resolutely carrying out the Party's policies can we ensure the continuous victory of the proletarian cultural revolution.

	To firmly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we must resolutely support the proletarian revolutionary leftists.

	Chairman Mao said: "Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people is a revolutionary, and whoever stands on the side of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism is a counter-revolutionary. Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people in words but acts differently is a revolutionary in words only. Whoever stands on the side of the revolutionary people in both words and deeds is a complete revolutionary." The soldiers and officers participating in the discussion unanimously felt that standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line means resolutely supporting the proletarian revolutionary leftists. Comrade Yuan Caihua, a gunnery class leader and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, said: Our People's Liberation Army is the great army founded by Chairman Mao and commanded by Vice Chairman Lin. We have unlimited love for and are determined to defend Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, and the Central Cultural Revolution Group. The proletarian revolutionary leftists listen most to Chairman Mao's words, love Chairman Mao the most, and are the most resolute in carrying out and defending Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We share the same thoughts and fighting tasks with the proletarian revolutionary leftists. Being loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line means firmly standing with the proletarian revolutionary leftists in the struggle.

	Comrade Xi Suiqun, a new soldier in the air force, said: The proletarian revolutionary leftists have made great achievements in the cultural revolution. The proletarian revolutionary leftists in Wuhan have made tremendous contributions to defending the proletarian cultural revolution initiated and led by Chairman Mao. Only by fully supporting the proletarian revolutionary leftists can we truly carry out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. In the work of supporting the left, we must hate what the left hates, love what the left loves, and be concerned about what the left is concerned about. We must unite with the left, fight against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and thoroughly defeat them! The revolutionary leftists love Chairman Mao the most, listen to Chairman Mao's words the most, and are the most resolute in carrying out Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Wherever Chairman Mao points, they charge. We must do the same and defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to the death. Only in this way can we integrate our thoughts with those of the revolutionary leftists. The revolutionary leftists dare to think, speak, and act, and dare to rebel against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party hate the revolutionary leftists to the core and always try to persecute them in various ways. To defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and the cultural revolution, we must take a firm stand, be clear in our attitude, and stand up to defend the proletarian revolutionary leftists.

	Learn from the left, support the left, and help achieve the revolutionary great alliance with the left as the core.

	Chairman Mao said: "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad masses of the left." The soldiers and officers participating in the discussion deeply felt from practice that to support the proletarian revolutionary leftists, one must first be a leftist. One must have unbounded love for the revolutionary leftists, seriously learn from them, firmly believe in them, rely on them, and enthusiastically help them. All revolutionaries loyal to our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, and loyal to the great cause of our great Party, must be heart to heart and shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary leftists, study Chairman Mao's works together in the struggle, firmly grasp the general direction of the struggle; implement the Party's policies together, summarize the experience of the struggle, and continuously improve the level of policies and the art of struggle.

	Comrade Xi Suiqun, a soldier in the air force, said: The proletarian revolutionary leftists listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and have the most revolutionary spirit of rebellion. They are the new revolutionary forces and the loyal executors and brave defenders of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Our support for the proletarian revolutionary leftists means learning from the revolutionary leftists, making ourselves have the stance, thoughts, attitudes, feelings, and spirit of the revolutionary leftists, truly supporting them wholeheartedly in politics, ideology, and all aspects, and sharing the same fate with them.

	Comrade Yang Denglian, a communications officer and an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, said: Supporting the revolutionary leftists means first supporting them politically and ideologically, supporting them in grasping the general direction of the struggle. The proletarian revolutionary rebel organizations such as "Steel General," "Steel Second Command," "Steel September 13," "New Hua Workers," "New Lake University," "New Hua Farmers," and "Three Command Revolutionary Alliance" in Wuhan dared to fight against violence, dared to struggle, dared to win, and defeated the frantic counterattacks of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the military in Wuhan and their backer, the Chinese Khrushchov. They bravely defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Their general direction of struggle is correct. They are our examples to learn from. We must raise high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and fully, unconditionally, and thoroughly support all their revolutionary actions, unite with them, fight with them, and win with them.

	Everyone also talked about the fact that in the situation where the proletarian cultural revolution in Wuhan is advancing to victory, the proletarian revolutionary leftists strengthening their iron-like unity and forming the broadest revolutionary great alliance with the left as the core have particularly important strategic significance. Revolutionary soldiers must contribute to enhancing the unity within the proletarian revolutionary leftists in Wuhan and must promote the revolutionary great alliance of the proletarian revolutionary leftists in Wuhan, building this vast proletarian cultural revolutionary army into a team with high revolutionary spirit, scientificity, and organizational discipline. Advance victoriously and quickly launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism.

	"The remaining courage should be used to pursue the fleeing enemy, and it is not advisable to seek fame like King Xiang Yu." The soldiers and officers participating in the discussion unanimously pointed out that the proletarian cultural revolution in Wuhan is entering a new stage of victory, and we must not relax our fighting spirit because of victory. The better the revolutionary situation is, the more we must pursue victory and launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism. We must firmly fight together with the proletarian revolutionary leftists in Wuhan, thoroughly defeat and expose the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road who have infiltrated the Party, the government, and the military, and criticize them deeply.

	Many comrades at the discussion meeting angrily denounced the heinous crimes of the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents in Wuhan, further arousing everyone's fighting spirit. Comrade Wu Zhenhai, the political instructor of the company where Huang Jiguang served, said: The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and their tentacles extending into the Party, government, and military in Wuhan have ruthlessly suppressed the revolutionary mass movement and madly manipulated the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, deceiving some people who do not understand the truth, creating white terror, thinking they can extinguish the blazing fire of the proletarian cultural revolution. Under the brilliant guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, with the support of Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and the proletarian revolutionary leftists nationwide, their plots have failed! Chairman Mao teaches us: "Imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat and will make their last struggle." We must double our vigilance and never be complacent. We must launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, be as resolute and brave as Comrade Huang Jiguang, and achieve the final victory of the cultural revolution.

	Comrade Yang Bingjun, a squad leader in the air force, said: To thoroughly isolate and overthrow the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the military, and the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, we must correctly handle the deceived masses, win them over, educate them, and unite them, so that they can quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. The deceived masses have been deceived and cheated. We should educate them, unite with them, and enthusiastically help them to revolt, launch a counterattack, direct the spearhead at the Chinese Khrushchov and his agents in Wuhan, and the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, thoroughly isolate them, and make them fall into the vast ocean of people's war.

    驻武汉地区陆海空三军指战员发出共同誓言
    毛主席亲自缔造林副主席直接指挥的人民解放军
    毫不含糊地支持无产阶级革命派痛击共同的敌人
    广大指战员纷纷举行座谈，决心更认真地向革命左派学习，同左派一起，痛击中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人，把武汉地区文化大革命推向新阶段
    新华社武汉二十九日电　在举国上下穷追猛打中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人的胜利凯歌声中，中国人民解放军驻武汉陆海空三军紧紧和无产阶级革命派站在一起的广大指战员，最近纷纷举行集会、座谈，满怀激情地向毛主席宣誓：毛主席亲手缔造的、林副主席直接指挥的人民解放军，生为执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线生，死为保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线死。为了执行和保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，为了支持无产阶级革命派，刀山敢上，火海敢闯。他们最坚决地表示：一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，毫不含糊地，不折不扣地全力支持武汉地区无产阶级革命派，誓同他们一道痛击中国的赫鲁晓夫和武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命推上新的胜利阶段。
    越是在关键时刻，越要最坚决地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边
    某部营长栾庆祥说：毛泽东思想是无产阶级和劳动人民的命根子。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，代表了广大劳动人民的利益。毛主席的声音是绝对真理。天大地大没有毛主席的恩情大，河深海深，没有毛主席的恩情深。谁胆敢反对毛主席，反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，谁就是我们不共戴天的敌人，我们就坚决和他拚到底。无产阶级革命派对毛主席无限热爱，对毛泽东思想无限信仰，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线无限忠诚，在艰苦的时候，他们英勇地保卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们千好万好，最根本的一条，就是忠实执行、勇敢保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线好！在斗争中，我深切认识到，谁反对无产阶级革命派，谁就是反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。树立了这样的信念，那就会在任何情况下，都能坚定不移地支持无产阶级革命派。
    某部指导员樊育美说，只有在我们头脑里树立了毛泽东思想绝对权威，才能在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线决战的关键时刻，坚决站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。毛主席的话，水平最高，威力最大，句句是真理，一句顶一万句。对毛主席的指示必须坚决执行。衡量我们头脑里是否树立了毛泽东思想的绝对权威，是否树立了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的绝对权威，一个重要标志，就是看我们在关键时刻，是不是不折不扣地贯彻执行毛主席的指示。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，代表了广大劳动人民的利益，代表了世界前进的方向，是红彤彤的“公”字的路线，是革命取得胜利的保证。在关键时刻，只有坚定地站在党和人民大众的立场上，坚定不移地执行党的方针政策，才能最强有力地保证无产阶级文化大革命取得一个又一个新的胜利。
    坚定不移地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，就要坚决支持无产阶级革命派
    毛主席说：“什么人站在革命人民方面，他就是革命派，什么人站在帝国主义封建主义官僚资本主义方面，他就是反革命派。什么人只是口头上站在革命人民方面而在行动上则另是一样，他就是一个口头革命派，如果不但在口头上而且在行动上也站在革命人民方面，他就是一个完全的革命派。”参加座谈会的指战员一致体会到，站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，就要坚决支持无产阶级革命派。海军某舰枪炮班班长、学习毛主席著作积极分子袁彩华说：我们人民解放军是伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的、林副主席直接指挥的人民军队。我们无限热爱和坚决保卫毛主席、林副主席、党中央和中央文革。无产阶级革命派，最听毛主席的话，最热爱毛主席，最坚决执行和保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。我们和无产阶级革命派有共同的思想感情，有共同的战斗任务。无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就是要坚定不移地跟无产阶级革命派战斗在一起。
    空军某部新战士席遂群说：无产阶级革命派在文化大革命中建立了丰功伟绩。武汉地区的无产阶级革命派，为了保卫毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命创造了非常巨大的业绩。只有全力支持无产阶级革命派，才是真正执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。在支左工作中，我们一定要恨左派所恨，爱左派所爱，急左派所急。我们要和左派团结在一起，狠斗党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，痛打“落水狗”，把他们彻底斗倒斗垮！革命左派最热爱毛主席，最听毛主席的话，最坚决执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。毛主席指向那里，他们就冲向那里。我们也必须这样做，誓死捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。只有这样，才能把我们的思想同革命左派的思想融合在一起。革命左派敢想、敢说、敢干，敢造党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反。一小撮走资本主义道路当权派对革命左派恨之入骨，总是千方百计地迫害他们。为了保卫毛主席的革命路线，保卫文化大革命，我们就是要立场坚定，态度鲜明，挺身而出，坚决保卫无产阶级革命左派。
    学习左派，支持左派，帮助实现以左派为核心的革命大联合
    毛主席说：“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众。”参加座谈会的三军指战员从实践中深刻体会到，要支持无产阶级革命左派，首先自己必须是左派。自己必须无比热爱革命左派，认真学习革命左派，坚定相信革命左派，放手依靠革命左派，热情帮助革命左派。一切忠于我们伟大统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席，忠于我们伟大的党的事业的革命战士，都必须同革命左派心连心，肩并肩，一起在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向；一起贯彻执行党的方针政策，总结斗争经验，不断提高政策水平和斗争艺术。
    空军某部战士席遂群说，无产阶级革命派最听毛主席的话，革命造反精神最旺盛。他们是革命的新生力量，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线的忠实执行者和勇敢保卫者。我们支持无产阶级革命派，就要向革命左派学习，使自己具有革命左派的立场、思想、态度、感情和干劲，真正作到一个心眼地从政治上、思想上和各个方面支持他们，与他们同呼吸、共命运。
    海军某舰观通长、学习毛主席著作积极分子杨登连说：支持革命左派，首先要从政治上、思想上支持他们，支持他们掌握斗争的大方向。武汉地区的“钢工总”、“钢二司”、“钢九·一三”、“新华工”、“新湖大”、“新华农”、“三司革联”等无产阶级革命造反派组织，不畏强暴，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，打败了武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其总后台中国的赫鲁晓夫的疯狂反扑，英勇地保卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。他们斗争的大方向是正确的。他们是我们学习的榜样。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，毫不含糊地、不折不扣地、完全彻底地支持他们的一切革命行动，同他们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    大家还谈到，在武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进的形势下，无产阶级革命派加强内部钢铁般的团结，结成以左派为核心的最广泛的革命大联合，具有特别重要的战略意义。革命战士一定要为增强武汉地区无产阶级革命派内部的团结作出贡献，一定要为武汉地区无产阶级革命派实现革命的大联合推波助澜，把这支浩浩荡荡的无产阶级文化革命大军建设成具有高度革命性、科学性、组织纪律性的队伍。乘胜前进，迅速掀起革命大批判的新高潮
    “宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”参加座谈的指战员们一致指出，武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命正在出现着一个新的胜利的阶段，我们切不可由于胜利而稍稍松懈自己的斗志。革命的形势越好，越要乘胜追击，越要更好地掀起革命的大批判的新高潮。坚决地同武汉地区无产阶级革命派战斗在一起，把混进党里、政府里和军队里一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底斗倒斗臭，批深批透。
    许多同志在座谈会上，无比愤怒地控诉了中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人的滔天罪行，进一步激发了大家的战斗意志。黄继光生前所在连队指导员吴振海说：党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派以及他伸向武汉地区党、政、军内的魔爪，穷凶极恶地镇压革命群众运动，丧心病狂地操纵“百万雄师”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头，蒙蔽一些不明真相的群众，制造白色恐怖，以为这样就可以把轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命烈火扑灭。在战无不胜的毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，在毛主席、林副主席、党中央、中央文革和全国无产阶级革命派的支持下，他们的阴谋破产了！毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”我们一定要加倍提高警惕，切切不可大意起来，一定要掀起一场革命大批判的新高潮，象黄继光同志那样的坚决和勇敢，夺取文化大革命的最后胜利。
    空军某部班长杨炳均说：要使党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，以及“百万雄师”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头彻底孤立，彻底垮台，必须正确对待受蒙蔽的群众，争取、教育、团结他们，使他们迅速回到毛主席的革命路线上来。受蒙蔽的群众上了当，受了骗，我们应该教育他们，团结他们，热情帮助他们起来革命，大杀回马枪，把矛头对准中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人，对准“百万雄师”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头，把这一小撮人彻底孤立起来，使他们陷入“人民战争”的汪洋大海。
