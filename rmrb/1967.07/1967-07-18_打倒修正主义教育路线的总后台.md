    Overthrow the Backer of the Revisionist Educational Line
    Shi Yanhong
    For seventeen years since the founding of the nation, the educational front, like the political and economic fronts, has been a site of intense and sharp class struggle between two classes and two lines. Chairman Mao has formulated a revolutionary socialist educational line for the proletariat. However, the biggest capitalist-road element within the Party, relying on the Party and government power he has usurped, has stubbornly pushed a long and thick counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. These are two diametrically opposed lines. The former aims to defend proletarian dictatorship; the latter aims to serve the restoration of capitalism. The former aims to cultivate and train successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause; the latter aims to perpetuate the lineage of the landlord and bourgeoisie.

    The biggest capitalist-road element within the Party is the backer of the revisionist educational line. Over the past seventeen years, this Chinese Khrushchev has, for the purpose of using education as a tool to realize his plot to usurp the Party, the military, and the government, gathered a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists who have long occupied the educational sector. They have madly resisted Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. Now is the time for us to thoroughly uproot the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and thoroughly overthrow the backer of this line.

    The Guardian of the Old Educational System
    In 1949, New China stood up like a giant in the East. Where is New China heading? Our great leader Chairman Mao had long made it clear: the Chinese revolution "cannot and will not establish a capitalist society under the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie," but must establish a "socialist society in China." However, the biggest capitalist-road element within the Party advocated "consolidating the new democratic order," shouting about the "merits of capitalist exploitation," and attempting to implement capitalism in China and overthrow proletarian dictatorship.

    This struggle between following the socialist road or the capitalist road was also reflected on the educational front.

    In the early days of the founding of the nation, there were two distinctly different types of education in the country. One was the new education of the old liberated areas. This new education developed under the personal leadership and guidance of Chairman Mao. From the peasant movement training schools during the first domestic revolutionary war to the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University led by Comrade Lin Biao during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and various schools in the liberated areas that carried on this revolutionary tradition, all were new proletarian revolutionary education. These schools trained a large number of revolutionary cadres. As early as 1934, Chairman Mao put forward the educational policy of the proletariat, which was "to educate the broad masses of the laboring people with the spirit of communism, to make cultural education serve the revolutionary war and class struggle, to combine education with labor, and to make the broad masses of the Chinese people enjoy the happiness of civilization." The core of this policy is that education must serve the proletariat in seizing national power.

    The other type was the old education taken over from the reactionary rule of the Kuomintang. This education served to maintain the reactionary rule and exploitation system of the landlords, bourgeoisie, and imperialism.

    At that time, the two types of education were vastly different in quantity. Taking higher education as an example, the new education of the liberated areas accounted for only fifteen percent, while the old education of the Kuomintang-controlled areas accounted for eighty-five percent.

    Thus, a sharp problem was placed before the educational front: should we use proletarian revolutionary education to reform the old education and serve to consolidate proletarian dictatorship, or should we preserve the old education of the landlords and bourgeoisie as it is and serve to implement capitalism and overthrow proletarian dictatorship?

    According to Chairman Mao's instructions, we should take the experience of the new education in the old liberated areas as the basis and "gradually and cautiously" reform the "existing school education system." Chairman Mao clearly pointed out: "In this matter, the idea of delaying time and not wanting to reform is wrong, and the idea of being too hasty and wanting to carry out reforms with rough methods is also wrong." In the early days of the founding of the nation, under Chairman Mao's call, the educational cause not only developed in quantity but also made some reforms.

    However, the biggest capitalist-road element within the Party openly resisted Chairman Mao's instructions. On the one hand, he vigorously denigrated the new education of the old liberated areas, slandering the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University-style schools as "training schools" and "not regular universities"; even attacking the educational policy personally formulated by Chairman Mao for the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University as "outdated" and "must be abandoned." On the other hand, he lavishly praised the schools set up by imperialism in China for cultural infiltration, claiming that universities set up "according to the experience of Western Europe, Britain, the United States, France, and Japan" had "many achievements in raising the cultural, scientific, and cognitive levels of the Chinese people." He shamelessly said: "No matter who, whether foreigners, capitalists, or anyone with money, as long as they are willing to set up and maintain schools, they are welcome.... Setting up schools is meritorious." This fully exposed the ugly face of this self-proclaimed "red comprador" slave. He also said things like "history textbooks have no materials, and 'Comprehensive Mirror for Aid in Government' can be read," urging us to learn from feudalism. Later, under the banner of "learning from the Soviet Union," he peddled a large amount of revisionist goods. He instructed a small clique of capitalist-road elements within the Ministry of Education to turn "complete Sovietization" into an "unshakable principle" for educational reform. Thus, under the green light of "learning from the Soviet Union," the rotten system of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism in education, from the educational system, curriculum setting, teaching materials, teaching methods to examination methods, changed heads and faces and passed smoothly.

    The Chinese Khrushchev also openly resisted Chairman Mao's instruction that "our educational policy should enable the educated to develop in all aspects of moral, intellectual, and physical education and become socially conscious, cultured laborers," shamelessly instilling the philosophy of "climbing up" into the youth. He demanded that students "seriously study their business" and "strive to become 'red experts'." He also said: "As long as you study a profession well, you will become famous and successful in the future, and you will have everything." The small clique of capitalist-road elements within the Ministry of Education, according to the "instructions" of the Chinese Khrushchev, drafted the "Regulations on Degrees, Titles, and Honorary Titles" and the "Regulations on the Cultivation of Associate Doctors and Graduate Students," attempting to use fame and wealth as bait to train the next generation of bourgeoisie that he needed.

    Under these circumstances, even some schools that originally had the tradition of running schools in the old liberated areas gradually abandoned their old traditions and adopted a set of feudal, capitalist, and revisionist practices. Some revolutionary universities in the style of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University were "reformed" into so-called "most scientific and advanced new-type regular universities" like Moscow University. The occurrence of these phenomena is not surprising; it is precisely the true purpose of the Chinese Khrushchev using education as a tool.

    After the founding of the nation, the result of the struggle between the two lines on the educational front was that the reactionary old education swallowed up the revolutionary new education. This is precisely the result of the biggest capitalist-road element within the Party acting as the guardian of the old educational system and madly opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line.

    The Commander of the Counter-Revolutionary Restoration
    In 1958, a historic and unprecedented educational revolution swept across China. This was the result of the profound changes on the political and economic fronts under the call of the three red banners proposed by Chairman Mao, and the "communist spirit" flourishing throughout the country, breaking the shackles of the revisionist educational line. In that year, Chairman Mao proposed the policy of serving proletarian politics and combining education with productive labor. Thus, an educational revolution erupted with irresistible momentum!

    This educational revolution was the first attempt by the workers, peasants, and soldiers to heroically occupy the educational front. They established various types of schools like bamboo shoots after a spring rain, breaking the serious situation where bourgeois intellectuals monopolized education. This educational revolution conducted a thorough criticism of the old educational system that had been covered up under the banner of "learning from the Soviet Union," gathering the essence of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. The reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie who ruled the educational sector immediately lost face and were swept away. This educational revolution was an unprecedented teaching reform movement, conducting comprehensive reforms on the school system, curriculum, teaching content, teaching methods, examination system, and so on. Schools set up factories and farms, and teachers and students went out of the study to learn in the three great revolutionary movements, combining with the working class and peasant masses.

    The biggest capitalist-road element within the Party was extremely hostile to the educational revolution. Even while the educational revolution was being carried out vigorously, he blew cold wind and spread poison, labeling the educational revolution with crimes such as "the quality of learning might decline." He even attacked the guiding principles of the educational revolution—the educational policy of Chairman Mao, shouting "the educational policy and purpose in the past were not clear" and that it should be "criticized." Later, he continued to viciously attack the great revolution on the cultural and educational front as "talking about revolution with quotation marks," as a "bias," and even directed his spearhead at the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, cursing the Party for "continuing like this, it will fall from power."

    From 1960 to 1962, the Chinese Khrushchev, taking advantage of the opportunity when domestic and foreign class enemies stirred up an anti-China and anti-communist tide, launched a frenzied attack on the Party, socialism, and Mao Zedong Thought. On the educational front, he colluded with the counter-revolutionary revisionist elements such as Lu Dingyi and others, under the pretext of "correcting the bias" and "improving teaching quality" in the educational revolution, to carry out a capitalist restoration. They painstakingly "summarized" the experience of the "elite" schools of the Beiyang warlord era and the Kuomintang era, copying and pasting the educational experience of imperialist countries such as the United States, Britain, and Soviet revisionism, carefully melting the rotten education of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism into one furnace, and disguising it as the theoretical summary of China's education over the past decade. They implemented a series of measures from the school system, curriculum, textbooks to regulations, forming a complete set, and forcibly promoted them. This was concentrated in the "Sixty Articles on Higher Education," "Fifty Articles on Secondary Education," and "Forty Articles on Primary Education." These counter-revolutionary revisionist programs were designated by the Chinese Khrushchev as the "fundamental law," forcing schools at all levels to absolutely and unconditionally implement them. Thus, the old educational system before 1958 was completely theorized, systematized, concretized, and legalized.

    These regulations emphasized the need to "maintain the normal order of schools," denying the achievements of the educational revolution, and vigorously promoting "intellectual education first" and "technology supreme," fundamentally rejecting the occupation of all positions in schools by Mao Zedong Thought, fundamentally opposing the thought revolution of people, and fundamentally not mentioning the struggle to eliminate bourgeois elements and promote proletarian elements in schools.

    The Chinese Khrushchev and his henchmen plotted and planned to propose the so-called "small pagoda" fallacy in the development of the educational cause and the educational system. This "small pagoda" is the capitalist version of opening schools and "development." Capitalists open schools, adopting an elimination system, eliminating a large number of young people, and allowing only a few to rise step by step. The Chinese Khrushchev vigorously promoted the so-called "key schools," advocating "to set up a few universities, recruit some outstanding students for further study," "study for a few years, and the quality must not be reduced," which is nothing more than preparing a batch of spiritual aristocrats who are handy for the restoration of capitalism. The eight-year university is one of the models of such schools. It "inherited drop by drop" the experience of the American imperialists in running schools. The eight-year system was inherited, the rule of bourgeois intellectuals over schools was inherited, and the elimination system, tutor system, and genius education and the whole set of imperialist educational systems were inherited intact. As a result, this school produced only over fifty students in more than seven years. Under the influence of this educational system, some of these students, in order to pursue personal fame and wealth, and to become "experts" and "professors," were unwilling to go down to the countryside and factories to serve the workers and peasants.

    The various types of schools set up by workers and peasants during the educational revolution, because they did not meet the requirements of the Chinese Khrushchev, were subjected to massive cuts. For example, according to incomplete statistics in 1962, agricultural middle schools were reduced from 22,600 to only 3,715, and the number of students was reduced from 2.3 million to 266,000; primary schools were also massively cut, and the enrollment rate of school-age children dropped from 80.3% in 1958 to 56.1%. Thus, a large number of children of workers and peasants were once again pushed out of the educational realm.

    According to the educational decrees designated by the Chinese Khrushchev, the Party in schools only played a "supervisory and guarantee" role. He once said ferociously: "The leadership position of the Party branch must be removed," handing over the educational power to bourgeois intellectuals. It was he who slandered the struggle against the reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie during the educational revolution as "putting on hats and fighting indiscriminately." It was also he who implemented the "removal of hats" and "coronation" policy for bourgeois intellectuals, removing the hats of bourgeois intellectuals and adding the crown of "labor intellectuals serving socialism." The value of bourgeois intellectuals immediately soared. The reactionary academic "authorities" of the bourgeoisie arrogantly shouted: "Since 1958, schools have been singing opera, and now it's time for us old actors to perform!" These monsters and demons usurped the power of the educational sector, ruthlessly implementing bourgeois dictatorship, and turning schools into the frontline positions for the restoration of capitalism. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "If things are done this way, then it will not take much time, a few years or a dozen years at the least, a few decades at most, to inevitably lead to a nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration. The Marxist-Leninist Party will definitely become a revisionist party, a fascist party, and the whole of China will change color."

    The Master of Fake Communist Education
    In 1962, Chairman Mao issued the great call to "never forget class struggle" at the Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee. The counterattack of the proletariat in the ideological realm began!

    From the 1950s to the 1960s, domestic and international class struggles became increasingly sharp. Many proletarian parties and socialist countries in the international communist movement degenerated and took the revisionist road. In particular, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, personally founded by Lenin, became a revisionist party, and the first socialist state became a state under the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, sounding the alarm for the revolutionary people of the world. After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production in our country, a current of capitalist restoration also emerged within our Party. How can China not change color? How can the Communist Party of China not become a revisionist party? This is the most important question that the proletariat and revolutionary people of the world have put to us.

    The great Communist Party of China, led by our brilliant leader Chairman Mao and armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, is able to give a perfect answer and solve this problem. Chairman Mao comprehensively, systematically, and scientifically expounded the theory of class, class contradictions, and class struggle in socialist society, proposed the theory and line, principles, and policies of continuing the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, and developed Marxism-Leninism to a new stage, the stage of Mao Zedong Thought.

    The struggle for the younger generation is a matter of life and death for our Party and country. Chairman Mao pointed out that we must cultivate and train millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause in the great winds and waves of class struggle. After the Spring Festival of 1964, Chairman Mao personally grasped the struggle between the two lines on the educational front and made many instructions on educational work.

    Chairman Mao taught us: "In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish always make their last struggle against the revolutionary forces." "The representatives of various exploiting classes, when they are in an unfavorable situation, in order to protect their current survival and benefit their future development, often adopt the strategy of attacking to defend." For a long time, the biggest capitalist-road element within the Party, hidden behind the scenes, saw the situation was not good, and jumped out in a state of extreme anger. Within three months after Chairman Mao's Spring Festival instructions, he threw out his "two kinds of labor systems, two kinds of educational systems" with a communist label, attempting to continue to resist the proletariat and preserve the reactionary forces of the bourgeoisie on the educational front, and restore capitalism in China.

    The Chinese Khrushchev boasted that his concocted "two kinds of labor systems, two kinds of educational systems" were one of the three major measures to "prevent revisionism." On the other hand, he took organizational measures to establish an "Education Office" with himself as the commander, and attempted to form a system, requiring the establishment of "Second Ministry of Education," "Second Bureau of Education," and "Second Department of Education" at all levels. This Chinese Khrushchev personally led the charge, touring more than ten provinces and cities across the country, and gave more than twenty reports. Within a year, the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Higher Education, the Ministry of Agriculture, and the Ministry of Health respectively convened five national conferences. His group of henchmen such as Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, and Jiang XXX were even more active, claiming to make the "invention" of "two kinds of educational systems" known to every household. While promoting his own prestige, the Chinese Khrushchev revealed his ferocious side, shamelessly directing his spearhead at our great leader Chairman Mao, shouting: "We must create a situation to defeat their army." "You are in power, and I can also be in power." Look, the counter-revolutionary arrogance of this Chinese Khrushchev has reached such a level!

    What exactly is the "two kinds of educational systems"? The Chinese Khrushchev himself has an explanation: "Our country should have two kinds of educational systems," "one is the current full-time school educational system," "this full-time school system cannot be reduced," "probably for a hundred years, two hundred years, three hundred years"; the other is the "half-work, half-study school system" that should be "vigorously developed." Obviously, the "two kinds of educational systems" are full-time plus half-work, half-study. Why does the Chinese Khrushchev want to do this? He said: "If you can't afford full-time, you have to go to half-time, and there are only so many full-time schools, so if you want to study, you have to go to half-time schools." His henchman Jiang XXX said more bluntly: "Those who can afford it, go to university; those who can't afford it, go to the countryside." It turns out that this is to cultivate a few spiritual aristocrats in full-time schools while using half-time schools to deal with the needs of workers and poor and lower-middle peasants who "can't afford" to study, training them to be driven "ordinary workers and peasants."

    Half-work, half-study is proposed by our great leader Chairman Mao. The biggest capitalist-road element within the Party used the method of changing the beam and replacing the pillar to distort Chairman Mao's great instructions on half-work, half-study, and peddle his own revisionist goods.

    The so-called "half-work, half-study" of the Chinese Khrushchev is equivalent to cutting half of the full-time system and supplementing it with labor, completely deviating from Chairman Mao's instructions that education should serve proletarian politics and achieve the thought revolution of people. "Half-study" is still like full-time, letting students cram books that deviate from Mao Zedong Thought and are detached from the three great revolutionary practices; "half-work" is only letting students participate in labor as a labor force. Such half-work, half-study is still inheriting a set of old educational systems, still letting bourgeois intellectuals rule the schools, and still vigorously promoting "intellectual education first" and "technology supreme," etc. Where is there any trace of communist education?

    Some half-work, half-study schools do not mention Chairman Mao's educational policy at all, do not carry out the class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie, and only advocate what is called the "school spirit" of "studying hard and working hard." For most of the time, students are sent to factories to work as labor; for a small part of the time, they are taught fragmented book knowledge from the full-time curriculum. The training goal is to become a "worker of several grades." And such a school is actually a half-work, half-study "red flag" that the Chinese Khrushchev vigorously promotes and personally establishes!

    In a word, the half-work, half-study of the Chinese Khrushchev is a vocational school of the bourgeoisie; the "two kinds of educational systems" is the twin-track system of "talent education" and "laborer education" in capitalist countries. The Chinese Khrushchev disguises the "two kinds of educational systems" as communist education, boasting that it is the "development of Marxism-Leninism" and the "best product with great international significance," which is enough to make people laugh!

    Because of his "two kinds of educational systems," it is not only impossible to narrow the three major differences but also intensifies class differentiation. Because of his "two kinds of educational systems," it does not mention at all that students should arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and consciously achieve thought revolution, but only requires students to "be able to do both physical labor and mental labor." Such students are not the "all-round developed new people" needed by the proletariat, but are only familiar with technology and use technology to climb up the revisionist seedlings.

    Because of his "two kinds of educational systems," it does not mention the struggle between the two classes and the two roads at all, does not mention strengthening and consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, but talks about "half-work, half-study itself is class struggle," inducing people to bury their heads and engage in education, which not only cannot "prevent the restoration of capitalism" but is precisely opening the way for the restoration of capitalism.

    It can be seen that the "two kinds of educational systems" repeatedly advocated and implemented by the Chinese Khrushchev are fake in eliminating the three major differences, true in widening the three major differences; fake in cultivating communist "all-round developed new people," true in training the successors of the bourgeoisie; fake in preventing the restoration of capitalism, true in restoring capitalism.

    The "two kinds of educational systems" proposed by the biggest capitalist-road element within the Party, in a word, is the concrete manifestation in education of his political line of abolishing class struggle, abolishing the dictatorship of the proletariat, and peacefully entering "communism."

    It is obvious that the Chinese Khrushchev is an unquestionable "master" of fake communist education.

    On May 7, 1966, Chairman Mao pointed out in a letter to Comrade Lin Biao: "Students should 'study as the main task, and learn other things as well,' that is, not only study literature but also study industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticize the bourgeoisie. The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionary, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals ruling our schools can no longer continue." Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" is the highest guideline for us to run schools. It formally sentenced the "two kinds of educational systems" implemented by the Chinese Khrushchev to death, and sentenced the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and the old educational system that he implemented for seventeen years since liberation to death.

    The magnificent proletarian cultural revolution, like a surging torrent, washed away all the dirt and filth left over from the old society. The educational front controlled by the Chinese Khrushchev, along with other fronts he controlled, were one by one seized back by the proletariat. The Chinese Khrushchev and his entire set of revisionist goods were dragged out and exposed. This is the great victory of the proletarian cultural revolution, the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought!

    Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, overthrow and expose the backer of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, criticize it thoroughly, and completely destroy the educational system of the exploiting classes that has ruled for thousands of years since Confucius, and turn our schools into great schools of Mao Zedong Thought! Let our descendants never change, let our rivers and mountains forever red, and red to the end!

    打倒修正主义教育路线的总后台
    师延红
    建国十七年来，教育战线同政治战线、经济战线一样，一直存在着激烈的尖锐的两个阶级、两条道路的斗争。毛主席为无产阶级制定了一条革命的社会主义教育路线。而党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却凭借窃踞的党政大权，顽固地推行一条又粗又长的反革命修正主义教育路线。这是两条根本对立的路线。前一条要为捍卫无产阶级专政服务；后一条要为资本主义复辟效劳。前一条要培养和造就无产阶级革命事业接班人；后一条要为地主、资产阶级传宗接代。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，是推行修正主义教育路线的总后台。在十七年中，这个中国的赫鲁晓夫为了把教育作为他实现篡党篡军篡政阴谋的工具，纠集了一小撮反革命修正主义分子，一直盘踞着教育界，疯狂地抗拒毛主席的无产阶级教育路线。现在，是我们彻底挖掉反革命修正主义教育路线，彻底打倒这条路线的总后台的时候了。
    旧教育制度的护法神
    一九四九年，新中国象巨人一样在世界的东方站起来了。新中国向何处去？我们伟大领袖毛主席早就明确指出：中国革命“决不是也不能建立中国资产阶级专政的资本主义的社会”，而只能是“建立中国社会主义的社会”。但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却提出了“巩固新民主主义秩序”的主张，叫嚣资本家“剥削有功”，妄图在中国实行资本主义，颠覆无产阶级专政。
    反映到教育战线上，同样也存在着走社会主义道路还是走资本主义道路的尖锐斗争。
    建国初期，全国存在着两种性质截然不同的教育。一种是老解放区的新教育。这种新教育是在毛主席亲自主持和领导下发展起来的。从第一次国内革命战争时期的农民运动讲习所，到抗日战争时期由林彪同志亲自领导的延安抗日军政大学，以及各解放区继承这些学校的革命传统所办的许多学校，都是崭新的无产阶级的革命教育。这些学校造就了大批的革命干部。早在一九三四年，毛主席就提出了无产阶级的教育方针，这个方针“在于以共产主义的精神来教育广大的劳苦民众，在于使文化教育为革命战争与阶级斗争服务，在于使教育与劳动联系起来，在于使广大中国民众都成为享受文明幸福的人。”这个方针的核心，就是教育必须为无产阶级夺取全国政权服务。
    另一种是从国民党反动统治下接收过来的旧教育。这种教育是为维护地主、资产阶级和帝国主义的反动统治和剥削制度而服务的。
    当时，这两种教育在数量上十分悬殊。以高等教育为例，解放区的新教育只占百分之十五，而国民党统治区的旧教育则占百分之八十五。
    这样，教育战线上一个尖锐的问题摆在面前：是用无产阶级的革命教育去改造旧教育，为巩固无产阶级专政服务，还是原封不动地保存地主、资产阶级的旧教育，为实行资本主义、颠覆无产阶级专政而效劳呢？
    按照毛主席的指示，应该以老解放区新教育的经验为基础，“有步骤地谨慎地”改革“旧有学校教育事业”。毛主席明确指出：“在这个问题上，拖延时间不愿改革的思想是不对的，过于性急、企图用粗暴方法进行改革的思想也是不对的。”建国初期，在毛主席的号召下，教育事业不仅在数量上有所发展，同时也作了一些改革。
    但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，公然抗拒毛主席的指示。他一方面极力贬低老解放区的新教育，诬蔑抗大式的学校是“训练班性质”，“不算正规的大学”；甚至攻击毛主席亲手制订的抗大办学方针“过时了”，“必须加以抛弃”。另一方面，他又大肆吹捧帝国主义为了进行文化侵略而在中国举办的学校，胡说什么“按照西欧、英国、美国、法国、日本这些国家的经验办起来”的大学，“对于提高中国人民的文化水平、科学水平和认识水平是有很多成绩的”。他无耻地说：“不论外国人、资本家及一切有钱的人，凡愿拿钱办学校、维持学校的都欢迎，……办学校是有功劳。”这充分暴露了这个自称“红色买办”的奴才的丑恶嘴脸。他还说什么“历史课本没有教材，《资治通鉴》也可以读”，要我们向封建主义学习。以后，他又在“学习苏联”的旗号下大肆贩卖修正主义的货色。他指使教育部党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把“全盘苏化”当作改革教育的“不可动摇的方针”。这样，封建主义、资本主义、修正主义教育的一套破烂，从教育制度、课程设置、教材内容、教学方法以至考试方法，就在“学习苏联”的绿灯下，改头换面，畅通无阻。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫还公然抗拒毛主席关于“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者”的指示，恬不知耻地向青年灌输“向上爬”的市侩哲学。他要求学生“认真钻研业务”，“努力使自己成为‘红色专家’”。又说：“只要学好一门专业，将来会成名成家，就有了一切。”教育部的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，按照中国的赫鲁晓夫的“指示”，草拟了《学位、学衔和荣誉称号条例》、《培养副博士、研究生条例》，企图以名利为钓饵，把青年一代培养成为他所需要的资产阶级接班人。
    在这情况下，连一些原来具有老区办校传统的学校，也逐渐地丢掉了老传统，搞起封、资、修的一套。有的抗大式的革命大学，就被“改造”成为莫斯科大学那样的所谓“最科学、最先进的新型正规大学”。这些现象的发生并不奇怪，正是中国的赫鲁晓夫利用教育这个工具的真实目的。
    建国以后在教育战线上两条道路斗争的结果，是反动的旧教育吞掉了革命的新教育。这正是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派充当了旧教育制度的护法神，疯狂反对毛主席的无产阶级教育路线的结果。
    反攻倒算的司令
    一九五八年，在我国掀起了一场史无前例的轰轰烈烈的教育大革命。这是在毛主席提出的三面红旗号召下，政治、经济战线上起了深刻的变化，“共产主义精神在全国蓬勃发展”，打破了修正主义教育路线束缚的结果。就在这一年，毛主席提出了教育为无产阶级政治服务，教育与生产劳动相结合的方针。于是，一场教育大革命就以不可阻挡之势，迅猛地爆发了！
    这场教育大革命是工农兵史无前例地英勇地占领教育阵地的第一次尝试，他们创办的各类学校如雨后春笋，资产阶级知识分子垄断教育的严重局面被打破了。这场教育大革命，对在“学习苏联”的遮羞布下，集封、资、修之大成的旧教育制度，进行了大批判；统治教育界的资产阶级反动学术“权威”顿时颜面无光，威风扫地。这场教育大革命，是一场空前的教学改革运动，对学制、课程、教学内容、教学方法、考试制度等等，进行了全面改革。学校大办工厂、农场，师生走出书斋，在三大革命运动中学习，同工农群众相结合。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，非常仇视教育大革命。还在教育大革命轰轰烈烈地开展之际，他就煽阴风、吹冷气，给教育大革命加上了“学习质量也可能下降”等罪名。他甚至还攻击教育大革命的指针——毛主席的教育方针，叫嚷“过去教育方针、教育目的不明确”，要“进行批判”。以后，他又不断地恶毒攻击文教战线上的大革命是“空谈革命，带引号的革命”，是“偏向”，并且把矛头直指以毛主席为首的党中央，咒骂党“继续这样搞下去，要跌下台”。
    一九六○年到一九六二年，中国的赫鲁晓夫趁国内外的阶级敌人掀起一股反华反共的逆流的时机，向党向社会主义向毛泽东思想发动了猖狂的进攻。他在教育战线上，伙同反革命修正主义分子陆定一等一伙，在“纠”教育大革命之“偏”、“提高教学质量”的幌子下，大搞资本主义复辟。他们煞费苦心地“总结”了北洋军阀时代和国民党时代“名牌”学校的经验，东抄西袭地搬用了美英等帝国主义、苏联修正主义的教育经验，把封、资、修的教育破烂精心地熔为一炉，把它披上马列主义外衣，冒充为新中国十几年教育的理论总结。他们从学制、课程、教材以至规章制度等搞了一系列的措施，配套成龙，强行推广。这集中表现在《高教六十条》、《中学五十条》和《小学四十条》上。这些反革命修正主义纲领，被中国的赫鲁晓夫钦定为“根本大法”，强迫各级学校必须绝对地无条件地贯彻执行。这样，一九五八年以前的旧教育制度，就完全理论化、系统化、具体化、法令化了。
    这些条例强调必须“保持学校的正常秩序”，否定教育大革命的成果，大搞“智育第一”、“技术至上”，根本排斥用毛泽东思想占领学校的一切阵地，根本反对人的思想革命化，根本不提在学校里进行灭资兴无斗争。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫和他的爪牙密谋策划，在教育事业的发展、教育体制上，提出所谓“小宝塔”的谬论。这个“小宝塔”，就是资本家开学店的翻版和“发展”。资本家开学店，采取淘汰制，把大批青少年刷下来，只让越来越少的人步步高升。中国的赫鲁晓夫大搞什么“重点学校”，主张“搞一两个大学，招一些优秀生深造”，“读几年，就几年，总之质量不要降低”，这无非是为复辟资本主义准备一批用起来得心应手的精神贵族。八年制的大学就是这种学校的样板之一。它“点滴不漏地继承了”美帝国主义的一套办学经验。八年制继承下来了，资产阶级知识分子对学校的统治继承下来了，淘汰制、导师制、天才教育等一整套帝国主义的教育制度也都原封不动地继承下来了。结果，这所学校在七年多的时间里，只培养出五十多名学生。在这种教育制度毒害下，这些学生中有些人为了追求个人名利，为了当“专家”、“教授”，就是不愿意下乡下厂去为工农服务。
    在教育大革命中涌现出来的工农举办的各类学校，因为不符合中国的赫鲁晓夫的要求，便遭到了大斧砍杀。例如，据一九六二年的不完全统计，农业中学从二万二千六百所，二百三十万名学生，一举砍到只剩下三千七百一十五所，二十六万六千名学生；小学也被大批砍掉，学龄儿童入学率由一九五八年的百分之八十点三，猛降到百分之五十六点一。这样，大量的工农子弟又被推出了教育禁地。
    按照中国的赫鲁晓夫钦定的教育法令，党在学校里只起“监督、保证”作用。他曾经凶神恶煞般地说：“就是要撤掉（党）支部的领导职务”，把教育大权交给资产阶级知识分子。正是他，把教育大革命中对资产阶级反动学术“权威”的斗争诬蔑为“戴帽子乱斗”。还是他，对资产阶级知识分子实行了“脱帽”、
  “加冕”政策，一律摘掉资产阶级知识分子的帽子，加上“为社会主义服务的劳动知识分子”的桂冠。资产阶级知识分子顿时身价百倍。资产阶级反动学术“权威”狂妄地叫嚷：“一九五八年以来学校唱小生戏，现在又该我们老生出场了！”这些牛鬼蛇神窃踞了教育界的大权，残酷地实行资产阶级专政，把学校变成了复辟资本主义的前哨阵地。正如毛主席所指出的：“照此办理，那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”
    假共产主义教育的祖师爷
    一九六二年，毛主席在八届十中全会上发出了
  “千万不要忘记阶级斗争”的伟大号召。无产阶级在意识形态领域内的反击战开始了！
    从五十年代至六十年代，国内、国际阶级斗争日益尖锐化。国际共产主义运动中许多无产阶级政党和社会主义国家蜕化变质，走上了修正主义的道路。特别是列宁亲自缔造的苏联共产党变成了修正主义的党，第一个社会主义国家变成了资产阶级专政的国家，向全世界革命人民敲起了警钟。当我国生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，我们党内也出现了一股资本主义复辟的暗流。中国怎样才能不变颜色？中国共产党怎样才能不变成修正主义的党？这是全世界无产阶级和革命人民向我们提出的最重要的问题。
    由我们天才的领袖毛主席领导和用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国共产党，是能够圆满地回答和解决这个问题的。毛主席全面地、系统地、科学地阐明了社会主义社会的阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的学说，提出了无产阶级专政下进行革命的理论和路线、方针、政策，把马克思列宁主义发展到了一个崭新的阶段，即毛泽东思想的阶段。
    争夺青年一代的斗争，这是关系我们党和国家命运的生死存亡的极其重大的问题。毛主席指出，要在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。一九六四年春节以后，毛主席亲自狠抓了教育战线上的两条路线的斗争，对教育工作做了多次指示。
    毛主席教导我们：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。“各种剥削阶级的代表人物，当着他们处在不利情况的时候，为了保护他们现在的生存，以利将来的发展，他们往往采取以攻为守的策略。”长期以来，隐藏在幕后的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，眼看形势不妙，气急败坏地跳了出来。他在毛主席的春节指示以后不到三个月，抛出了他的贴着共产主义商标的“两种劳动制度，两种教育制度”，企图和无产阶级继续顽抗，保存教育阵地上的资产阶级反动势力，在中国复辟资本主义。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫把他所炮制的“两种劳动制度，两种教育制度”，吹嘘成是“防修”的三大措施之一。另一方面，他又采取组织措施，成立一个由自己挂帅的“教育办公室”，还企图自成系统，要各级相应建立“第二教育部”、“第二教育厅”、“第二教育局”。这个中国的赫鲁晓夫赤膊上阵，周游全国十几个省市，作了二十多个报告。一年之内，由教育部、高教部、农业部、卫生部分别出面，召开五次全国性会议。他的一群狐群狗党如彭真、陆定一、蒋××之流，更是四出奔波，扬言要使“两种教育制度”这个“发明”家喻户晓。中国的赫鲁晓夫在大树自己威信的同时，凶相毕露，放肆地把矛头指向我们伟大的领袖毛主席，叫嚣：“就是要造成一个形势，将他们的军。”“你当权，我也可以当权。”看，这个中国的赫鲁晓夫的反革命气焰，达到了何等嚣张的地步！
    所谓“两种教育制度”，到底是什么货色呢？中国的赫鲁晓夫自己有一个解释：“我们的国家应该有两种教育制度”，“一种是现在的全日制的学校教育制度”，“这种全日制学校不能缩小”，“大概要一百年、二百年、三百年”；另一种是要“大力发展”的“半工半读的学校制度”。显然，“两种教育制度”就是全日制加半工半读。中国的赫鲁晓夫为什么要搞这套玩意儿呢？他说：“上全日制上不起，就得上半日制，而全日制就这么多，要读书就只好上半日制学校嘛。”他的爪牙蒋××说得更露骨：“上得起的，进大学；上不起的，下农村。”原来这是要在全日制培养少数精神贵族的同时，由半日制学校来应付“上不起”学的工人、贫下中农子女的需要，把他们培养成为被驱使的“普通工人农民”。
    半工半读是我们伟大的领袖毛主席提出的。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派用偷梁换柱的手法，篡改了毛主席关于半工半读的伟大指示，推销他自己那一套修正主义的货色。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫所谓的“半工半读”，等于全日制砍掉一半，补上劳动，完全违背了毛主席的教育为无产阶级政治服务，和实现人的思想革命化这些指示。“半读”，还是象全日制一样，让学生死啃违背毛泽东思想、脱离三大革命实践的死书；“半工”，只是让学生作为一个劳动力参加劳动。如此半工半读，还是承袭一套旧教育制度，还是让资产阶级知识分子统治学校，还是大搞“智育第一”、“技术至上”等等，哪里有一点共产主义教育的气味呢？
    有的半工半读学校，根本不提毛主席的教育方针，根本不搞无产阶级对资产阶级的阶级斗争，只是宣扬什么“学习猛钻、劳动猛干”的“校风”。大半时间，要学生作为劳动力到工厂里劳动；小半时间，讲授全日制教材上的支离破碎的书本知识。培养目标，就是成为“几级工”。而这样的学校，竟然是中国的赫鲁晓夫大肆吹捧、亲自树立的半工半读“红旗”！
    一句话，中国的赫鲁晓夫的半工半读，就是资产阶级的职业学校；“两种教育制度”，就是资本主义国家的“人才教育”和“劳动者教育”的“双轨制”的翻版。中国的赫鲁晓夫把“两种教育制度”冒充为共产主义教育，吹嘘“是马克思列宁主义的发展”，是“具有伟大国际意义的”最好货色，岂不叫人笑掉了牙！
    由于他的“两种教育制度”，是让有钱的人上“全日制”，“培养专家”，经济比较困难的工人、贫下中农子弟上半工半读，培养“普通工人农民”，这就不但不能缩小三大差别，反而加剧了阶级分化。
    由于他的“两种教育制度”，根本不谈要学生用毛泽东思想武装头脑，自觉地实现思想革命化，而只要求学生“体力劳动与脑力劳动都能搞”，这样的学生根本不是无产阶级所需要的“全面发展的新人”，而是只懂得技术、借技术向上爬的修正主义苗子。
    由于他的“两种教育制度”，闭口不提两个阶级和两条道路的斗争，不提加强和巩固无产阶级专政，而谈什么“半工半读本身就是阶级斗争”，引诱人们埋头去搞教育，这就不但不能“防止资本主义的复辟”，而正是为资本主义复辟开拓道路。
    由此可见，中国的赫鲁晓夫所一再鼓吹、一再推行的“两种教育制度”，“消灭三大差别”是假，扩大三大差别是真；培养共产主义“全面发展的新人”是假，造就资产阶级的接班人是真；“防止资本主义复辟”是假，复辟资本主义是真。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所提出的“两种教育制度”，归结到一点，就是他的取消阶级斗争，取消无产阶级专政，和平长入“共产主义”的政治路线在教育上的具体表现。
    显而易见，中国的赫鲁晓夫是一个不折不扣的假共产主义教育的“祖师爷”。
    一九六六年五月七日，毛主席在给林彪同志的信里指出：学生要“以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级。学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”毛主席的“五·七”指示，是我们办教育的最高纲领。它正式宣判了中国的赫鲁晓夫所推行的“两种教育制度”的死刑，宣判了解放十七年来他所推行的反革命修正主义教育路线和旧教育制度的死刑。
    轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命，象一股汹涌澎湃的巨流，荡涤着旧社会遗留下来的一切污泥浊水。中国的赫鲁晓夫所控制的教育阵地，连同他所控制的其他阵地，一个个被无产阶级夺回来了。中国的赫鲁晓夫及其一整套修正主义货色，被揪出来示众。这是无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利！
    让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把反革命修正主义教育路线的总后台斗倒斗臭，批深批透，彻底摧毁从孔夫子以来统治了几千年的剥削阶级教育制度，把我们的学校办成毛泽东思想的大学校！使我们的子孙万代永不变质，使我们的江山永远红，红到底！
