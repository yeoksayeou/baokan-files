In the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, the Indian people have fired the first shot of armed revolution. The revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India has led peasants in Darjeeling County to launch armed struggles and establish a red area.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on July 4th, our correspondent comments: A region of armed struggle led by the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India has been initially established in the rural areas of Darjeeling County, West Bengal, India. This is the spark of armed revolutionary struggle by the Indian people under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. It represents the general direction of the current Indian revolution. The Indian people, the Chinese people, and people all over the world are cheering for the appearance of this armed struggle region.

According to Indian newspapers, this armed struggle region is established in the mountainous areas of the Siliguri region of Darjeeling County in northern West Bengal, covering three villages: Naxalbari, Haribari, and Pansidwa. This red area was established in early March, covering an area of about 270 square miles with a population of 80,000. It has stood firm for nearly four months under the siege of the white regime. Now, about twenty villages with relatively strong revolutionary forces have raised the red flag.

The revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, which advocates seizing power through armed struggle, proposed the slogan of arming peasants and establishing rural bases to prepare for armed struggle as early as 1965. Over the past two years, they have been working on mobilizing and organizing peasants. After the "Fourth General Election" in India in early March this year, a "United Front" government that is not the Indian National Congress appeared in West Bengal. This is a tool used by Indian reactionary forces to deceive the people and weaken their revolutionary will. Revolutionary members of the Communist Party of India in the province launched a movement to "leave this United Front government" and "participate in the Darjeeling struggle," going to places like Naxalbari to further lead and organize peasants in armed land struggles, aiming to follow the path of the Chinese revolution.

Millions of landless and land-poor peasants in the area, who are cruelly exploited and oppressed by landlords and plantation owners, have been initially armed under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India and have begun to establish their own government, organize peasant associations, and strongly oppose the Indian reactionary government and the landlord class.

They are "lawless," trampling the "laws" of the reactionary government that protect the property of landlords underfoot, armed occupation and cultivation of landlords', plantation owners', and reactionary government's land, driving out plantation owners, armed seizure of rice from landlords' fields, seizing grain and weapons from the homes of large landlords, levying money and grain from landlords, and abolishing hoarding. They have established "people's courts" to judge and punish stubborn local tyrants and evil gentry. According to official Indian disclosures, from early March to late June, there have been eighty such actions.

They are "lawless," ignoring the reactionary government's orders to maintain "order" for reactionary rule, banning gatherings of more than four people and carrying weapons, holding continuous armed demonstrations, and organizing armed squads to move around. Women play a prominent role in the peasant movement in this area. They carry their children on their backs, hold bows and arrows, and usually lead the armed squads moving around.

The peasants who have organized in each village hold bows and arrows and guard the villages day and night, remaining vigilant against police "extermination." They have set up alarm bells and alarm devices to alert the people when the police approach the village.

The rebel peasants have launched multiple successful ambushes against the reactionary military and police during "extermination," causing the reactionary military and police to suffer casualties and flee in disarray.

On May 24th, when a police force came to the villages of Siliguri to "exterminate" and arrest peasants participating in land seizures, they were ambushed and surrounded by 400 armed peasants, injuring four police officers. On the 25th, a police force led by an officer from Siliguri and the deputy police chief came to the outskirts of Naxalbari, opening fire on peasants who were seizing rice from a landlord's field. They were again attacked by armed peasants, resulting in one death and three injuries. Their "extermination" was repelled. On the 26th, 500 peasants surrounded a landlord's house that had weapons.

In several consecutive clashes in late May, a total of one police officer and more than a dozen police were killed. The rebel peasants removed police camps in three villages.

The armed struggle of peasants in this region has shaken India and promoted land seizure struggles by peasants in various parts of West Bengal. Indian newspapers and Western news agencies have revealed that peasant violent struggles in other regions of West Bengal are also "continuously flourishing," and "more regions are developing into 'Naxalbari regions'."

The establishment of an armed struggle region led by the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India in a semi-colonial and semi-feudal country with a population of 500 million and imbalanced political and economic development—India—marks that the struggle of the Indian people against Indian reactionary rule, which has been developing in recent years, is entering a new stage.

The great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, said: "In class society, revolution and revolutionary war are inevitable. Without this, the leap in social development cannot be completed, the reactionary ruling class cannot be overthrown, and the people cannot gain power."

To achieve their liberation, the Indian people must follow the path indicated by Comrade Mao Zedong. The path taken by Chairman Mao to lead the Chinese people to overthrow reactionary rule and achieve revolutionary victory is a path of using armed revolution to oppose armed counter-revolution, establishing rural bases, concentrating forces in the countryside, using the countryside to surround the cities, and then seizing the cities. This is also the only correct path for the Indian people to achieve revolutionary victory. The establishment of the armed struggle region of peasants in Darjeeling County led by the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India indicates that the Indian people have begun to take this path to victory.

### 在毛泽东思想的指引下，走中国人民的革命道路　印度人民打响武装革命第一炮　印共革命派领导农民在大吉岭县开展武装斗争建立红色地区

　　在毛泽东思想的指引下，走中国人民的革命道路
　　印度人民打响武装革命第一炮
　　印共革命派领导农民在大吉岭县开展武装斗争建立红色地区
    据新华社四日讯　本社记者评述：一块由印度共产党革命派领导的农民武装斗争地区，已经在印度西孟加拉邦大吉岭县农村中初步建立起来。这是在毛泽东思想的指引下，印度人民开展革命武装斗争的星星之火。它代表了当前印度革命的大方向。印度人民、中国人民和全世界人民都为这个革命武装斗争地区的出现而欢呼。
    据印度报纸透露，这块武装斗争地区，建立在西孟加拉邦北部山区大吉岭县西里古里区的纳萨尔巴里、哈里巴里和潘西德瓦三个乡内。这块红色地区是在三月初开始建立的，面积约二百七十平方英里，人口有八万。它从建立以来，已经在白色政权的包围中巍然矗立了近四个月。现在，革命力量比较强大的约二十个村庄，已经树起了红旗。
    西里古里区内主张通过武装斗争夺取政权的印度共产党革命派，一九六五年就提出武装农民，建立农村基地，为武装斗争作准备的口号。两年来，他们一直在做发动和组织农民的工作。今年三月初印度“第四届大选”后，西孟加拉邦出现了一个非国大党的“统一阵线”政府。这是印度反动势力用来欺骗人民、麻痹人民革命斗志的工具。邦内要革命的印共党员，开展了一个“离开这个统一阵线政府”和“参加大吉岭斗争”的运动，到纳萨尔巴里等地区进一步领导和组织农民进行土地武装斗争，要走中国革命的道路。
    当地千万个受地主和种植园主残酷剥削压迫的无地少地的农民，在印共革命派的领导下初步武装起来，开始建立自己的政权，组织起农会，大造印度反动政府和地主阶级的反。
    他们“无法无天”，把反动政府规定的保护地主财产的“法律”踩在脚下，武装占领并耕种地主、种植园主和反动政府的土地，驱逐种植园主，到地主占有的土地上武装抢割稻子，从大地主的家里夺取粮食和枪支弹药，向地主征收钱、粮，取缔囤积居奇。他们建立了“人民法庭”，审判和惩办顽抗的土豪劣绅。据印度官方透露，从三月初到六月上旬，这类行动达八十起。
    他们“无法无天”，对反动政府为维持反动统治的“秩序”而颁布的、禁止四人以上集会和禁止携带武器的命令置之不理，连续举行武装示威，并组成武装的小队四处活动。妇女在这个地区的农民运动中起着突出的作用。她们背上孩子，手里拿着弓箭，通常都走在四处活动的武装队伍的前头。
    各村已经组织起来的农民，手持弓箭，日夜守卫着村庄，对警察“进剿”保持戒备。他们设立了警钟和警报器，在警察逼近村子时，向人民发出警报。
    起义农民对于“进剿”的反动军警，进行了多次胜利的伏击，使反动军警损兵折将，狼狈逃窜。
    五月二十四日，当一支警察部队到西里古里区的乡村中“进剿”、逮捕参加夺地的农民时，受到四百名武装农民的伏击和包围，四名警官被打伤。二十五日，一支由西里古里区的军官和警察局副局长率领的警察部队，来到纳萨尔巴里附近，向在地主的稻田里抢割稻子的农民开枪，他们又受到农民武装的袭击，被打死一名，打伤三名。他们的“进剿”被打退了。二十六日，五百名农民包围了一家藏有枪支的地主。
    在五月下旬连续几次冲突中，共有一名警官和十多名警察被打死。起义农民在三个乡内拔除了警察营地。
    这个地区的农民武装斗争，震动了印度全国，也推动了西孟加拉邦各地的农民夺地斗争。印度报纸和西方通讯社透露，西孟加拉邦其它一些地区的农民暴力斗争，也在“不断地蓬勃发展”，“更多的地区正在发展成为‘纳萨尔巴里地区’”。
    由印共革命派领导的农民武装斗争地区，在有五亿人口政治经济发展不平衡的半殖民地半封建的大国——印度出现，标志着印度人民近年来日益发展的反抗印度反动统治的斗争，正在进入一个新的阶段。
    世界人民伟大的导师毛主席说：“在阶级社会中，革命和革命战争是不可避免的，舍此不能完成社会发展的飞跃，不能推翻反动的统治阶级，而使人民获得政权。”
    印度人民要争取自己的解放，必须走毛泽东同志所指明的道路。毛主席领导中国人民推翻反动统治，取得革命胜利的道路，就是一条用武装的革命反对武装的反革命，建立农村根据地，在农村聚集力量，用农村包围城市，然后夺取城市的道路。这也是印度人民要取得革命胜利唯一正确的道路。印度共产党革命派领导的大吉岭县农民武装斗争地区的建立表明，印度人民开始走上了这条胜利的道路。
