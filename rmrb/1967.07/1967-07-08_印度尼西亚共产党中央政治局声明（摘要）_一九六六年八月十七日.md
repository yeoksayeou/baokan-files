The first issue of the *Indonesian Forum*, published in November of last year, featured a statement issued by the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the Indonesian Communist Party on August 17, 1966. The statement's subtitle was "Completing the Tasks of the August 1945 Revolution Through the Revolutionary Path."

The statement noted that this year, the Indonesian people are commemorating the 21st anniversary of the August 1945 Revolution under the rule of the counter-revolutionary regime led by the right-wing military leaders Suharto and Nasution. In the modern history of Indonesia, there has never been such a period of nearly a year where the forces led by the reactionary military leaders have carried out such rampant counter-revolutionary terror, the savagery of which can only be compared to Hitler's Nazism. However, no matter how cruel and savage the counter-revolutionary attacks are, they cannot extinguish the spirit of the working class, peasants, and other revolutionary forces.

Revolutionaries and democrats are gradually reorganizing and resisting the military dictatorship of the reactionary military leaders Suharto and Nasution. All this is being done under the continuous threat of terror, in difficult and arduous conditions. The revolutionary spirit of the Indonesian people is truly indomitable!

The Indonesian Communist Party, which should have been at the forefront of the Indonesian working class and all revolutionary forces by historical necessity, has not only begun to rebuild its organization from the severe destruction, but has also started to return to the correct path, the revolutionary path illuminated by Marxism-Leninism, through criticism and self-criticism in its leadership and the entire party.

Why did the August 1945 Revolution not achieve its objective goals?

Given the objective conditions, since Indonesia was a colonial, semi-feudal country at the time, the August 1945 Revolution had a bourgeois-democratic character. It had two tasks: to drive imperialism out of Indonesia, liberate the entire nation, and to carry out democratic reforms, thoroughly smash the feudal remnants, and liberate the peasants from the oppression of foreign and domestic landlords.

The statement pointed out that the August 1945 Revolution was part of the world proletarian socialist revolution. It was a new type of bourgeois-democratic revolution. The complete victory of a new type of bourgeois-democratic revolution means creating conditions for the realization of the socialist revolution. Therefore, the future of the August 1945 Revolution is socialism and communism.

The driving forces of the August 1945 Revolution were the working class (proletariat), peasants, and the petty bourgeoisie outside the peasants. The anti-imperialist aspect of the August 1945 Revolution (which was prominent in the early stages of the revolution) was able to mobilize extremely broad strata of the Indonesian people. Not only the national bourgeoisie, which was to a certain extent anti-imperialist and anti-feudal, but also other patriots, including patriotic landlords, participated in or aided the war of independence against Dutch imperialism.

The statement said that the experience of the August 1945 Revolution shows that the Indonesian Communist Party, as the vanguard of the Indonesian working class, did not occupy the position of leader of the people's liberation struggle. When the Indonesian Communist Party joined the August 1945 Revolution, it was not well-prepared. It was very weak in theory and lacked an understanding of the specific conditions of Indonesian society, which prevented the Indonesian Communist Party from correctly determining and formulating the nature and tasks of the revolution, the revolutionary program, strategy and slogans, and organizational principles and forms. The high prestige that the Indonesian Communist Party enjoyed among the Indonesian people—this prestige was gained through its brave struggle against Dutch and Japanese colonial rule—did not turn into the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party over the August 1945 Revolution.

Theoretical weakness and the inability to conduct a concrete analysis of the world and Indonesian situation prevented the Indonesian Communist Party from utilizing the very good opportunity provided by the August 1945 Revolution to overcome its shortcomings. The Indonesian Communist Party did not resolutely lead the armed struggle against Dutch imperialism, did not develop guerrilla warfare combined with the democratic movement of the peasants, and thus did not gain the full support of the peasants, which was the only way to defeat the Dutch imperialist war of aggression. On the contrary, the Indonesian Communist Party even supported and implemented the reactionary compromise policy of the right-wing Social Party leader Sjahrir; the Indonesian Communist Party did not establish a worker-peasant alliance by leading the anti-feudal struggle in the countryside and, on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance, establish a united front with all other democratic forces; the Indonesian Communist Party did not strengthen itself but rather made its role disappear. These are the reasons why the August 1945 Revolution did not proceed as it should have, did not achieve a decisive victory, and ultimately did not achieve its objective goals.

The fundamental question of every revolution is the question of state power

The statement pointed out that for every revolutionary, especially a communist, it is absolutely necessary to understand the correctness of the proposition that "the fundamental question of every revolution is the question of state power."

The oppressed class can only free itself from oppression and exploitation by revolution, that is, by violently overthrowing the ruling class in state power or violently seizing state power. Because the state is a tool created by the ruling class to oppress the ruled class.

However, for a true people's revolution in the contemporary era, it is not enough to merely seize power from the oppressing class and use this seized power. Marx taught that "the destruction of the military-bureaucratic state machine is 'a prerequisite for any true people's revolution'" (Lenin: *The State and Revolution*. *Collected Works of Lenin*, Volume 25, page 402). Any true people's revolution can only talk about achieving a decisive victory if it has realized this prerequisite and, at the same time, established a completely new power structure. This power structure is tasked with ruthlessly suppressing any resistance from the overthrown oppressing class by force.

What should the August 1945 Revolution do regarding the question of state power?

As a prerequisite, the August 1945 Revolution should have smashed the colonial state machine and all institutions established to maintain colonialism in Indonesia, and should not have merely transferred power to the Republic of Indonesia. The August 1945 Revolution should have established a completely new state, a state ruled jointly by the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal classes under the leadership of the working class. This is what is called a people's democratic state.

The statement pointed out that without the leadership of the working class, the Republic of Indonesia could not be anything but a state where the bourgeoisie is in power, with the proletariat also participating. A state with such a class nature could not be the instrument of the August 1945 Revolution. Without a people's democratic dictatorship, the August 1945 Revolution could not have the tool to defeat the enemy and therefore could not complete its task of thoroughly eliminating imperialism and feudal remnants.

In 1948, the communists voluntarily withdrew from the cabinet led by the communists, providing the broadest opportunity for the reactionary bourgeoisie led by Hatta to seize state power. This reactionary bourgeoisie carried out white terror in the Madiun incident, betrayed the August 1945 Revolution, and was the prelude to restoring Dutch imperialist interests through the humiliating Round Table Conference agreement, which turned Indonesia into a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country.

The statement said that after the Round Table Conference agreement, the resurgence of the Indonesian people's revolutionary struggle against imperialism and feudal oppression, which had achieved certain political victories and partial or reformist victories, was achieved by weakening the anti-democratic nature of the bourgeoisie's power.

However, it is wrong to think that the existence of such a government means a fundamental change in the class nature of state power. Similarly, it is incorrect to think that the facts listed above indicate the emergence and development of a side or a pro-people side within the state power of the Republic of Indonesia.

The erroneous theory of "two sides within state power" summarizes that, based on the facts listed above, there are two sides within the Republic of Indonesia: on the one hand, the "anti-people side" composed of comprador bourgeoisie, bureaucratic capitalists, and landlords, and on the other hand, the "pro-people side" mainly composed of the national bourgeoisie and the proletariat.

According to this "two sides within state power" theory, a miracle would occur in Indonesia. That is, the state would no longer be a tool for the ruling class to oppress other classes, but would become a tool jointly controlled by the oppressing class and the oppressed class. The fundamental transformation of state power, the birth of people's power, could be achieved peacefully through the development of the "pro-people side" and the gradual elimination of the "anti-people side."

The statement pointed out that according to the plan of the "two sides within state power" theory, hoping to achieve a fundamental transformation of state power by having the "pro-people side" defeat the "anti-people side" and leading the people to the throne of power is purely an illusion. Only through an armed revolution led by the working class, overthrowing the power of the comprador bourgeoisie, bureaucratic capitalists, and landlords who represent the interests of imperialism and feudal remnants, can the people seize the throne of power.

In practice, the theory of "two sides within power" abolished the independence of the proletariat in the united front with the national bourgeoisie, dissolved the interests of the proletariat into the interests of the national bourgeoisie, and turned the proletariat into an appendage of the national bourgeoisie.

To restore the position of the proletariat as the leader of the Indonesian people's liberation struggle, to correct the errors of the "two sides within power" theory, and to overcome the erroneous ideas about Marxism-Leninism's philosophy of state and revolution, this is absolutely necessary.

The path to a completely independent and democratic new Indonesia

The statement said that after the August 1945 Revolution, Indonesia was still a country that was not completely independent or was still semi-colonial and semi-feudal. The rulers of Indonesia were not the people, but the upper class of the bourgeoisie and the landlords. Only a small part of the ruling class of Indonesians tasted the sweetness of independence. While the people, especially the workers and peasants who made the greatest sacrifices during the August 1945 Revolution, were still living under the exploitation and oppression of imperialism and feudal remnants and were therefore far from being independent and liberated.

Currently, the military dictatorship of the right-wing military leaders Suharto and Nasution, composed of the classes of bureaucratic capitalists, compradors, and landlords, and their accomplices, not only has not reduced the exploitation of the Indonesian people by imperialism and feudal remnants, but has further intensified this exploitation.

Facts have proven that to implement dictatorship over the people, the right-wing military leaders Suharto and Nasution and their accomplices are completely relying on the "aid" of imperialist countries led by the United States. The military dictatorship of the right-wing military leaders Suharto and Nasution, with the aid of international imperialism led by the United States, is establishing neo-colonialism in Indonesia!

The statement pointed out that the fundamental contradictions in Indonesian society today are the same as those at the time of the August 1945 Revolution, that is, the contradiction between imperialism and feudal remnants and the people who demand complete independence and democracy.

Therefore, the object of the revolution remains unchanged, that is, imperialism and feudal remnants. The class that becomes the enemy of the revolution remains basically unchanged, that is, imperialists, compradors, bureaucratic capitalists, and landlords, while the driving force of the revolution does not change, that is, the working class, peasants, and petty bourgeoisie.

The statement said that after the imperialists no longer directly hold power in Indonesia, their political interests are represented by the comprador bourgeoisie, bureaucratic capitalists, and landlords who hold power in the Republic of Indonesia.

Therefore, the concrete realization of the overthrow of the domestic reactionary class power and the overthrow of imperialism and feudal remnants is only possible. This is the primary task of the Indonesian revolution in the current stage.

The statement pointed out that the Indonesian people are currently facing the military dictatorship of the right-wing military leaders Suharto and Nasution and their accomplices, which is the embodiment of the most reactionary forces in the country. The people have no democratic rights, and every revolutionary and democratic movement is suppressed by armed force, which forces the entire nation to take up arms to defend their rights.

Armed struggle by the people against armed counter-revolution is inevitable and will be the main form of future revolutionary struggle. Only through this armed struggle can the Indonesian people overthrow the armed counter-revolutionary power, which is the condition for realizing their decades-long wish for independence and freedom.

The statement said that the armed struggle to defeat the armed counter-revolutionary power, as a revolution, cannot be carried out through the path of a coup that separates from the masses, adopting the method of military adventurism.

The statement emphasized that because the essence of the Indonesian revolution in the current stage is the peasant land revolution, the essence of the armed struggle of the Indonesian people is also the armed struggle of the peasants to liberate themselves from the oppression of feudal remnants. If the armed struggle of the peasants does not have the essence of implementing the land revolution, then the armed struggle against the armed counter-revolution will not be sustainable and will ultimately fail. Only the armed struggle of the peasants to implement the land revolution under the leadership of the proletariat can achieve complete victory, truly liberating the peasants from the oppression of feudal remnants. This is not only the case for overthrowing the landlord power in the countryside, but also for smashing the entire domestic counter-revolutionary power represented by the military dictatorship of the right-wing military leaders Suharto and Nasution and their accomplices.

Conclusion

The statement said that after re-examining the basic issues of the experience of the August 1945 Revolution, we can draw conclusions of great significance for the Indonesian proletariat and its vanguard, the Indonesian Communist Party, to solve their future tasks.

1. The August 1945 Revolution, as a new type of bourgeois-democratic revolution with the task of thoroughly smashing imperialism and feudal remnants, can only achieve victory under the leadership of the proletariat. To achieve leadership of the new type of bourgeois-democratic revolution, the proletariat must first ally with the peasants and, on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class, establish a revolutionary united front with other revolutionary classes and strata. Only with a correct program and strategy that can guide the revolutionary process and be accepted by allies, a strong organization, and becoming a model for executing various national tasks, can the proletariat perform the task of leading the revolutionary united front. In the correct program, the significance of the revolutionary land program for establishing the worker-peasant alliance is great; in the correct strategy, the significance of mastering armed struggle, which relies on the support of the peasants, as the main form of struggle is great. Only when the proletariat has its own party, the Indonesian Communist Party, which is a party completely guided by Marxist-Leninist revolutionary theory and free from all kinds of opportunism, can all this be realized.

2. The condition for completely fulfilling the tasks of the August 1945 Revolution is not to seize state power from foreign imperialists and transfer this power to the Republic of Indonesia, but to smash the entire colonial state machine and establish a completely new state, a people's democratic dictatorship, which is a united power of various anti-imperialist and anti-feudal classes under the leadership of the working class. The people's democratic dictatorship, as the instrument of the new type of bourgeois-democratic revolution, must ruthlessly suppress all revolutionary enemies by force and guarantee the broadest democratic rights of the people.

3. Only through the revolutionary path that will inevitably occur again and is of the same nature as the August 1945 Revolution, that is, the path of the new type of bourgeois-democratic revolution, can the Indonesian people liberate themselves from the exploitation and oppression of imperialism and feudal remnants. The most important task of the future revolution is to smash the domestic counter-revolutionary power represented by the military dictatorship of the right-wing military leaders Suharto and Nasution and their accomplices through armed struggle. Only the armed struggle of the peasants to implement the land revolution, which is essential for defeating the armed counter-revolution, can achieve victory. Only under the leadership of the proletariat, the armed struggle of the peasants to implement the land revolution can achieve complete victory, smashing the power of all domestic counter-revolutionary forces.

4. To lead and win the victory of the people's democratic revolution, the party faces the tasks: first, to continue rebuilding the Indonesian Communist Party, which is free from all forms of opportunism, resolutely opposes subjectivism and modern revisionism, and is guided by Marxism-Leninism; at the same time, to continue the work of awakening, organizing, and mobilizing the masses, especially workers and peasants. Second, to prepare for leading a long-term armed struggle combined with the peasant land revolution in the countryside. Third, on the basis of the worker-peasant alliance led by the working class, to establish a united front with all forces opposing the military dictatorship of the right-wing military leaders Suharto and Nasution. These are the three banners of the party for conducting the people's democratic revolution.

The statement said that the international proletariat and all peoples opposing imperialism are allies of the future Indonesian revolution. While the arch-criminal of world counter-revolution, American imperialism, is receiving help from the modern revisionists of the Khrushchev type, it is facing the inevitable disaster of a shameful defeat in Vietnam.

The statement finally said, let us dedicate all our strength to respond to the call to realize future tasks, to overthrow the military dictatorship of the right-wing military leaders Suharto and Nasution, and to open the path to a new Indonesia free from imperialism and feudal remnants!

　　印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局声明（摘要）
　　一九六六年八月十七日
    新华社七日讯　去年十一月出版的第一期《印度尼西亚论坛》，刊登了印度尼西亚共产党中央政治局于一九六六年八月十七日发表的声明。声明的副题是《通过革命道路来实现一九四五年八月革命本应完成的任务》。
    声明指出，印度尼西亚人民这一次是在以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安陆军右派将领为首的反革命的统治的情况下，纪念一九四五年八月革命二十一周年的。在印度尼西亚现代史上，还未曾见到象以陆军反动将领为首的势力在将近一年的时间内所实行的那样猖獗的反革命恐怖，其野蛮程度只有希特勒纳粹主义能同它相比。但是，不管反革命的猖狂进攻如何残忍和野蛮，他们是不能够消灭工人阶级、农民和其他革命动力的锐气的。
    革命分子和民主分子逐步地重新组织起来并对苏哈托—纳苏蒂安陆军反动将领的军事独裁进行了反抗。这一切是在继续不断的恐怖的威胁下，在困难和艰苦的情况中进行的。印度尼西亚人民的革命精神是何等不可摧毁！
    按照历史的必然性而应当居于印度尼西亚工人阶级和印度尼西亚一切革命力量的先锋队地位的印度尼西亚共产党，不仅已经开始从极其严重的破坏中重建它的组织，而且由于在领导方面和全党开展了批评和自我批评，也已经开始重新走上正确的道路，马克思列宁主义所照亮的革命的道路。
    为什么一九四五年八月革命没有实现它的客观目标？
    按照客观条件，由于当时印度尼西亚是一个殖民地、半封建的国家，因此，一九四五年八月革命具有资产阶级民主主义性质，它有两项任务，即：把帝国主义从印度尼西亚驱逐出去，解放全民族，并且实行民主改革，彻底粉碎封建残余，把农民从外国地主和本国地主的压迫下解放出来。
    声明指出，一九四五年八月革命是世界无产阶级社会主义革命的一部分。它是新式的资产阶级民主主义革命。新式的资产阶级民主主义革命的完全胜利意味着为实现社会主义革命创造条件。所以，一九四五年八月革命的前途是社会主义和共产主义。
    一九四五年八月革命的动力是工人阶级（无产阶级），农民和农民以外的小资产阶级。一九四五年八月革命的反帝方面（这方面在革命初期是突出的）有可能动员印度尼西亚的极其广泛的各个阶层。不仅是在一定程度上反帝反封建的民族资产阶级，而且其他爱国分子，包括爱国的地主也都参加或帮助反对荷兰帝国主义的独立战争。
    声明说，一九四五年八月革命的经验表明，作为印度尼西亚工人阶级先锋队的印度尼西亚共产党，尚未居于印度尼西亚人民解放斗争领导者的地位。印度尼西亚共产党参加到一九四五年八月革命中去的时候，没有很好的准备。在理论方面非常弱，对印度尼西亚社会的具体情况缺乏了解，这就使得印度尼西亚共产党未能正确地确定和制定革命的性质及其任务，革命的纲领、策略和口号以及组织的原则和形式。印度尼西亚共产党在印度尼西亚人民中间享有的很高的威望——这种威望是由于它在荷兰和日本殖民统治时期的反帝斗争中所表现的英勇精神而获得的——未能变成印度尼西亚共产党对一九四五年八月革命的领导。
    理论上的软弱和没有能力对世界和印度尼西亚的具体形势进行具体分析，使印度尼西亚共产党未能利用一九四五年八月革命所提供的非常好的机会来克服它的缺点。印度尼西亚共产党没有坚决领导反对荷兰帝国主义的武装斗争，没有发展同农民的民主运动相结合的，从而获得农民充分支持的游击战争，而这是打败荷兰帝国主义侵略战争的唯一道路。相反的，印度尼西亚共产党甚至赞同并执行了沙里尔右翼社会党人的反动的妥协政策；印度尼西亚共产党没有通过领导农村的反封建斗争来建立工农联盟，并在工农联盟基础上建立同一切其他民主力量的统一战线；印度尼西亚共产党没有加强自己，反而使自己的作用消失。这些就是一九四五年八月革命之所以没有象理应的那样进行，没有能够取得决定性的胜利，最后没有实现它的客观目标的原因。
    一切革命的根本问题是国家政权问题
    声明指出，对每一个革命者，尤其是共产党人来说，了解“一切革命的根本问题是国家政权问题”的论断的正确性是绝对必需的条件。
    被压迫阶级要从压迫和剥削中解放自己，除了进行革命，即用暴力推翻国家政权中的压迫阶级或用暴力夺取国家政权外，没有其它道路。因为国家是统治阶级为了压迫被统治阶级而制造的工具。
    但是，对当代真正的人民革命来说，仅仅从压迫阶级手中夺取政权，并利用这一夺得的政权，那是不够的。马克思教导说，摧毁军事官僚国家机器是“任何一次真正的人民革命的先决条件”（列宁：《国家与革命》。《列宁全集》第二五卷第四○二页）。任何一个真正的人民革命，只有实现了这个先决条件，并且与此同时建立起完全崭新的政权机构，才能谈得上取得决定性的胜利。这个政权机构负有用暴力无情地镇压已被推翻的压迫阶级的任何反抗的任务。
    在国家政权问题上，一九四五年八月革命应当做些什么呢？
    作为先决条件，一九四五年八月革命应当粉碎殖民主义国家机器以及为维护在印度尼西亚的殖民主义而建立的一切机构，并不应仅仅将政权转到印度尼西亚共和国手中。一九四五年八月革命应当建立起一个完全崭新的国家，在工人阶级领导下、由反帝反封建的各阶级共同统治的国家。这就是被人们称为的人民民主国家。
    声明指出，由于没有工人阶级的领导，印度尼西亚共和国不能不是一个资产阶级当权的国家，而无产阶级也参加在里面。具有这样的阶级性质的国家不能成为一九四五年八月革命的工具。没有人民民主专政，一九四五年八月革命就不能拥有打败敌人的工具，因此也就不可能完成它的任务，即彻底肃清帝国主义和封建残余。
    一九四八年共产党人自动退出共产党人领导的内阁，为哈达领导的反动资产阶级掌握国家政权提供了最广泛的机会。这一反动资产阶级在茉莉芬事件中实行白色恐怖，背叛了一九四五年八月革命，这是通过屈辱的圆桌会议协定来恢复荷兰帝国主义的利益的前奏，圆桌会议协定把印度尼西亚变成了一个半殖民地半封建的国家。
    声明说，在圆桌会议协定之后，印度尼西亚人民继续进行反对帝国主义和封建残余压迫的革命斗争的重新兴起，已经取得了一定的政治上的胜利，部分的或改革的胜利，这是通过削弱资产阶级政权的反民主性质而取得的。
    但是，如果认为存在这样的政府就意味着国家政权的阶级性质的根本改变，那是错误的。同样的，认为上述所列举的事实，是标志着国家政权内代表人民利益的一个方面或拥护人民的方面的产生和发展，那也是不正确的。
    归纳为国家政权内“两个方面的理论”的这种错误，认为根据上述所列举的事实，在印度尼西亚共和国国家内部存在着两个方面，即：由买办资产阶级、官僚资本家和地主组成的“反对人民的方面”为一方和主要由民族资产阶级和无产阶级组成的“拥护人民的方面”为另一方。
    按照这个“两个方面的理论”，在印度尼西亚就会发生奇迹。这就是国家不再是统治阶级镇压其他阶级的工具，而变成了压迫阶级同被压迫阶级共同掌握的工具。而国家政权的根本变革，即人民政权的产生，能够通过发展“拥护人民的方面”和逐步消灭“反对人民的方面”来和平地实现。
    声明指出，按照国家政权中“两个方面的理论”的计划，希望通过“人民的方面”战胜“反对人民的方面”而发生国家政权的根本变革，引导人民取得政权的宝座，这纯粹是一种幻想。只有通过在工人阶级领导下的武装革命，推翻代表帝国主义和封建残余利益的买办资产阶级、官僚资本家和地主的政权，人民才能取得政权的宝座。
    在实践中，关于政权中的“两个方面的理论”取消了在同民族资产阶级建立统一战线中的无产阶级独立性，把无产阶级的利益溶化在民族资产阶级的利益中，把无产阶级变成民族资产阶级的附属品。
    为了恢复无产阶级作为印度尼西亚人民解放斗争的领导者的地位，纠正在政权中的“两个方面的理论”的错误，并克服那些对于马克思列宁主义关于国家与革命哲学的错误思想，这是绝对必要的。
    实现完全独立和民主的新印度尼西亚的道路
    声明说，一九四五年八月革命发生以后，印度尼西亚是一个尚未完全独立的或者仍然是半殖民地半封建的国家。统治印度尼西亚的不是人民，而是资产阶级的上层和地主。只有统治阶级中的一小部分印度尼西亚人尝到了独立的甜头。而人民，特别是在一九四五年八月革命时期作了最大牺牲的工人和农民，仍然是在帝国主义和封建残余的剥削和压迫下生活，因此还远未独立和解放。
    目前，由官僚资本家、买办和地主各阶级组成的苏哈托—纳苏蒂安陆军右派将领及其同谋者的军事独裁集团的统治，不仅没有减轻帝国主义和封建残余对印度尼西亚人民的剥削，反而进一步加紧了这种剥削。
    事实证明，为了对人民实行独裁，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安陆军右派将领及其同谋者正在完全依靠以美国为首的帝国主义国家的“援助”。苏哈托—纳苏蒂安陆军右派将领及其同谋者的军事独裁政权，在以美国为首的国际帝国主义的援助下，正在印度尼西亚建立新殖民主义！
    声明指出，目前印度尼西亚社会的基本矛盾和一九四五年八月革命发生时的基本矛盾仍然一样，这就是帝国主义和封建残余同要求完全独立和民主的人民大众的矛盾。
    因此，革命对象仍然不变，即帝国主义和封建残余。成为革命敌人的阶级基本上不变，即帝国主义者、买办分子、官僚资本家和地主，而革命动力也不变，即工人阶级、农民和小资产阶级。
    声明说，在帝国主义者不直接掌握印度尼西亚的政权之后，他们的政治利益是由掌握印度尼西亚共和国国家政权的买办资产阶级、官僚资本家和地主所代表。
    因此，只有推翻国内反动阶级的政权，推翻帝国主义和封建残余，才能具体实现。这就是现阶段印尼革命的首要任务。
    声明指出，印度尼西亚人民目前面对着苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派将领及其同谋者的军事独裁，这是国内最反动的各阶级势力的体现。人民没有民主权利，每一个革命的、民主的运动都遭到武装暴力镇压，这就不能不迫使全国人民拿起武器来保卫自己的权利。
    武装的人民反对武装的反革命的斗争是不可避免的，而且是未来的革命的最主要的斗争形式。只有通过这种武装斗争的道路，印度尼西亚人民才能推翻武装的反革命政权，这是为实现他们几十年来为之而奋斗的愿望，即独立和自由的条件。
    声明说，打败武装反革命的政权的武装斗争，作为革命来说，不可以通过同发动人民群众相脱离的政变途径，采取军事冒险主义的方式来进行。
    声明强调，由于现阶段的印度尼西亚革命的实质是农民土地革命，所以印度尼西亚人民武装斗争的实质也就是农民为了从封建残余的压迫下解放自己的武装斗争。如果农民的武装斗争不具有实行土地革命的实质，那么，反对武装的反革命的武装斗争就不可能持久，最后一定会失败。只有在无产阶级领导下，实行土地革命的农民武装斗争才能取得完全的胜利，真正地把农民从封建残余的压迫下解放出来，这不仅推翻农村中的地主政权是这样，而且粉碎目前由苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派将领及其同谋者的军事独裁集团所代表的整个国内反革命政权也是这样。
    结论
    声明说，在重新研究了一九四五年八月革命经验的基本问题之后，我们可以作出对印度尼西亚无产阶级及其先锋队印度尼西亚共产党解决他们将来的任务具有十分重大意义的结论。
      （一）一九四五年八月革命，作为具有彻底粉碎帝国主义和封建残余的任务的新式的资产阶级民主革命，只有在无产阶级领导下才能取得胜利。为了实现对新式的资产阶级民主革命的领导权，无产阶级首先必须同农民结成联盟，并且在工人阶级领导下的工农联盟的基础上建立同其他革命阶级和阶层的革命统一战线。只有有了能成为指导革命进程的方针和为同盟者所接受的正确的纲领和策略，有了强大的组织，并成为执行各项民族任务的模范，无产阶级才能执行革命统一战线领导者的任务。在正确的纲领方面，建立工农联盟的革命的土地纲领，其意义是十分重大的；在正确的策略方面，掌握依靠农民的支持的武装斗争这一主要斗争形式，其意义是十分重大的。只有无产阶级有了自己的政党，即印度尼西亚共产党，而这个党是一个完全由马克思列宁主义革命理论指导的并摆脱形形色色的机会主义的党，所有这一切才能实现。
      （二）彻底完成一九四五年八月革命的任务的条件，不是从外国帝国主义者手里夺取国家政权而将这个政权转到印度尼西亚共和国手里，而是必须粉碎整个殖民主义国家机器，并建立完全崭新的国家，即人民民主专政，它是工人阶级领导下的各个反帝反封建阶级的联合政权。作为新式的资产阶级民主革命的工具的人民民主专政，必须用暴力无情地镇压一切革命敌人，并且保证人民的最广泛的民主权利。
      （三）只有通过必将再次发生的、其性质与一九四五年八月革命相同的革命的道路，即新式的资产阶级民主革命的道路，印度尼西亚人民才能从帝国主义和封建残余的剥削和压迫下解放出来。未来的革命的最重要的任务是：通过武装斗争粉碎目前由苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派将领及其同谋者的军事独裁集团所代表的国内反革命政权。只有其实质是实行土地革命的农民武装斗争，为打败武装的反革命而进行的武装斗争才能取得胜利。而只有在无产阶级的领导下，粉碎国内一切反革命力量的政权，实行土地革命的农民武装斗争才能取得完全的胜利。
      （四）为了领导并赢得人民民主革命胜利，党所面临的任务是：第一，继续重建摆脱一切形式的机会主义的、坚决反对主观主义和现代修正主义的、马克思列宁主义的印度尼西亚共产党；与此同时，继续进行重新唤醒、组织和发动群众，特别是工人和农民的工作。第二，准备领导与农村的农民土地革命相结合的长期的武装斗争。第三，在工人阶级领导的工农联盟的基础上，同反对苏哈托—纳苏蒂安陆军右派将领军事独裁的一切力量建立统一战线。这就是党为了进行人民民主革命的三面旗帜。
    声明说，国际无产阶级，一切反对帝国主义的人民，都是今后的印度尼西亚革命的同盟者。而世界反革命的罪魁美帝国主义虽然得到赫鲁晓夫式的现代修正主义者的帮助，但它在越南正面临着不可避免的可耻失败的灾难。
    声明最后说，让我们一心一意地献出我们的全部力量来响应为实现今后的任务的号召，推翻国内反革命的首领苏哈托—纳苏蒂安陆军右派将领军事独裁政权，开辟走向消灭帝国主义和封建残余的新印度尼西亚的道路！
