Recently, I received a copy of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and a single-volume edition of Chairman Mao's works from the Foreign Languages Press in Beijing. This was an unexpected and precious gift! I immediately read all the books.

The more I read Chairman Mao's works, the more I feel my own inadequacies. I deeply feel the need to study Chairman Mao's works more diligently and to put what I learn into practice. I am determined to read Chairman Mao's books, to arm myself with Mao Zedong Thought, and to firmly participate in the class struggle in Japan. I am willing to be a faithful student of Chairman Mao.

I will definitely study Mao Zedong Thought more thoroughly, become a faithful student of Chairman Mao, and thoroughly defeat revisionism. I have personally experienced that to struggle against imperialism and reactionaries, one must also struggle against revisionism. I will strive even harder to study Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the pinnacle of Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards extinction and revolutionary forces are advancing towards victory. I will continue to struggle according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

    学习毛泽东思想参加反修斗争
    不久前，我收到北京外文出版社寄来的《毛主席语录》和毛主席著作单行本。这真是没有想到的珍贵礼物啊！我马上把书都读了。
    读毛主席的著作，越读越感到自己的不足。我深感到需要更加努力地学习毛主席著作，同时要做到活学活用。我决心读毛主席的书，用毛泽东思想来武装自己，坚定地参加日本的阶级斗争。我愿意做一个毛主席的忠实的学生。
    我一定要更好地学习毛泽东思想，做毛主席的忠实的学生，彻底打倒修正主义。我亲身体会到，要与帝国主义和反动派进行斗争，就必须和修正主义进行斗争。我要更加努力地学习毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是帝国主义走向灭亡，革命势力全面走向胜利时代的马克思列宁主义的顶峰。我要按照毛主席的指示斗争下去。
