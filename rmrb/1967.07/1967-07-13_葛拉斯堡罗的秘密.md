Glassboro, a small town that is hard to find even on a map of the United States, was once known only for producing a famous liquor bottled in small house-shaped containers. Now, however, it has become famous far and wide because Johnson and Kosygin spent two days in a "honeymoon" at a place called Hollybush. If the name "Glassboro" once made people think of an aged fine wine, today it has become a symbol of the global collusion between the United States and the Soviet Union.

Why did Johnson and Kosygin choose this small place as the venue for their big deal? Officials in Washington and American bourgeois newspapers have offered various explanations and speculations about this somewhat mysterious question.

Some say that Glassboro was chosen for security reasons; others say it was chosen because it is convenient for both sides; some say it is because Glassboro has a beautiful landscape; others say it is because the talks in Glassboro are "undisturbed," and so on and so forth, with various opinions and no consensus. However, it is clear that none of these reasons can justify why the leaders of the United States and the Soviet Union chose to meet in Glassboro.

So, why did Kosygin and Johnson specifically choose Glassboro? It turns out there is a lot of intrigue involved. Some Western newspapers have finally unraveled this mystery.

The story is as follows:

Kosygin traveled thousands of miles to New York just to have a secret talk with Johnson. He couldn't wait to go straight to the White House. However, as the American *Newsweek* magazine said, he did not dare go to Washington because "Kosygin did not want the Arabs to see him as a beggar at Johnson's table." He hoped that Johnson would come to New York to meet him. Wanting to engage in treachery but not wanting to reveal his traitorous face, this is the common psychology of all traitors throughout history.

Johnson, on the other hand, had the idea of surrendering and accepting traitors, and he also wanted to have a secret talk with Kosygin. However, he was not willing to give the other side the "honor" of coming to him. Due to Kosygin's difficulties, the two sides discussed the meeting place several times but could not reach an agreement, causing Kosygin to wait in New York for several days.

In the end, it was Johnson who was clever. He came up with a "compromise plan." According to British newspapers, Johnson called several of his confidants to his bedroom, opened a map of the eastern coast of the United States, and drew a straight line between Washington and New York. He found Glassboro, a place equally distant from Washington and New York, in the middle of the line. He conveyed this idea to Kosygin through the U.S. Secretary of State Rusk in New York. Kosygin agreed enthusiastically. Kosygin obviously thought that in this way, he would not appear to be a "beggar," and he could also later boast, "The meeting was held at Johnson's suggestion."

However, Kosygin's self-deception is so ridiculous! Kosygin thought that from New York to Glassboro was a hundred miles, and from Washington to Glassboro was also a hundred miles, with both sides walking half the distance, and no one could say who was accommodating whom. However, people know that Kosygin traveled thousands of miles from Moscow to Glassboro, and the distance from Moscow to Glassboro is far greater than the distance from Washington to Glassboro. Kosygin was clearly throwing himself into someone's arms, but he was pretentious and feigned restraint, trying to cover up his ugly appearance. Isn't this ugliness on top of ugliness?

The key point is not where the talks are held. Kosygin is using the interests of the people of the world to make deals with Johnson. No matter where the deal is finalized, it is equally shameful and treacherous. Even if Kosygin invited Johnson to Moscow and made this dirty political deal in the Kremlin, it would still be treachery. It's just that this time Kosygin delivered the goods to the doorstep, making it even more shameful.

    葛拉斯堡罗的秘密
    迅雷
    葛拉斯堡罗，这个在美国地图上也不容易找到的小镇，据说过去只是以出产一种用小房子形状的瓶子盛载的名酒而为人们所知，而现在却因为约翰逊和柯西金在一所叫霍利布什的小房子里度了两天“蜜月”而远近知名了。如果说“葛拉斯堡罗”这个名字，以前使人联想到的是一种陈年的佳酿的话，那末今天它却成了美苏全球大勾结的一个标记。
    约翰逊和柯西金为什么要选择这个小地方作为他们做大交易的地点呢？关于这个颇带一点神秘色彩的问题，华盛顿的官员和美国的资产阶级报刊，作了各种各样的解释和猜测。
    有的说，挑选葛拉斯堡罗是为了安全；有的说，挑选葛拉斯堡罗，是因为它对“双方都方便”；有的说，这是因为葛拉斯堡罗风景幽雅；有的说，这是因为在葛拉斯堡罗会谈“不受打扰”等等，等等，众说纷纭，不一而足。但是，很显然，所有这些都不能成为美苏两国头目要在葛拉斯堡罗会谈的理由。
    那末，柯西金和约翰逊到底为什么要选定葛拉斯堡罗这个地方呢？原来这里面大有奥妙。一些西方报刊终于把这个谜揭开了。
    事情是这样的：
    柯西金不远万里跑到了纽约，就是为了要同约翰逊密谈的，他恨不得一下子直奔白宫。但是，正象美国《新闻周刊》所说的，他不敢上华盛顿去，因为“柯西金不愿意阿拉伯人把他看成是约翰逊餐桌旁边的乞讨者”，他希望约翰逊能到纽约去同他见面。既要干叛卖的勾当，却又不愿意被人看穿自己的叛徒面目，这是古往今来一切叛徒的共同心理。
    约翰逊呢，心里打着招降纳叛的主意，也是想同柯西金密谈的，不过他不肯给对方这份“移樽就教”的面子。由于柯西金有难言之隐，双方在会晤地点的问题上几经磋商也未谈妥，害得柯西金在纽约干等了好几天。
    毕竟还是约翰逊有心眼，他想出了一个“折衷方案”。据英国报刊透露，约翰逊把几个亲信找到了他的卧室，打开一张美国东海岸的地图，在华盛顿和纽约之间画一道直线，在它的中点地区找到葛拉斯堡罗这个离华盛顿和纽约一般远的地方。他把这个意见通过在纽约的美国国务卿腊斯克告诉了柯西金。柯西金就欣然同意。柯西金显然认为，这样一来，他就不显得是一个“乞讨者”，而且以后还可以大事宣传，“会晤是根据约翰逊的建议举行的”了。
    但是，柯西金这种自欺欺人的把戏是多末可笑呀！柯西金以为他从纽约到葛拉斯堡罗走的是一百英里，约翰逊从华盛顿到葛拉斯堡罗走的也是一百英里，双方各走一半的路，谁也不能说是谁迁就了谁。然而，人们知道，柯西金是从莫斯科长途跋涉走了几千英里到葛拉斯堡罗去的，从莫斯科到葛拉斯堡罗之间的距离同华盛顿到葛拉斯堡罗之间的距离，相差何止万里？柯西金明明是投怀送抱，却矫揉造作，假装矜持，妄图掩饰自己的丑态，这岂不是丑上加丑吗？
    问题根本不在于会谈的地点在何处。柯西金拿世界人民的利益去同约翰逊做交易，不管在什么地方拍板成交，都同样是可耻的大叛卖。那怕柯西金把约翰逊请到莫斯科去，在克里姆林宫中做这种肮脏的政治交易，还不一样是叛卖？只不过柯西金这次送货上门，显得更可耻一点罢了。
