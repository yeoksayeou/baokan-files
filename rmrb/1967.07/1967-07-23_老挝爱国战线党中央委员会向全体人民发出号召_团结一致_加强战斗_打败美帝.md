The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front has issued a call to all the people to unite and strengthen the struggle to defeat the US imperialists.

	KANGPHANG, July 22 (Xinhua) - According to a broadcast by the Pathet Lao radio station, the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front recently issued a statement calling on the Lao people to further unite and resolutely struggle against the plans of US imperialism and its lackeys to expand the war of aggression.

	The statement said: Over the past five years, US imperialists, in order to use the puppet regime as a tool to implement "special warfare" in Laos, have resorted to all sorts of means through their lackeys, right-wing leaders, and Prince Souphanouvong to sabotage the tripartite national unity government. The US imperialists manipulated the Souvanna Phouma-Kouprasith reactionary clique to stage the April 19, 1964, coup in Vientiane to overthrow the tripartite national unity government and establish the current so-called "Vientiane government" nominally headed by Prince Souphanouvong. In fact, the Souphanouvong government is nothing more than a puppet of the Americans. This puppet has systematically expelled patriotic ministers and government members who have no connection with the imperialist lackeys through various treacherous and despicable means.

	The statement emphasized: The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front once again reiterates that the so-called "Souphanouvong government," no matter what guise it wears, is an illegal government, a puppet of the Americans; the Lao people despise this government that betrays the country, and the words and actions of this puppet government are completely ineffective. The US and its lackeys, including Prince Souphanouvong, must bear full responsibility for the consequences they have caused.

	The statement said: In domestic and foreign affairs, the "Souphanouvong government" merely plays the role of a puppet of the Americans. Domestically, this government, in order to intensify the war of aggression and impoverish the people, serves the reactionary policies of the Americans, and allows the Americans to trample on Laos' sovereignty and independence at will, turning the areas under US control into a new colony of the Americans, providing a base for manpower and material support for the Americans to continue their war of aggression against our country and to continue their plans to enslave our people. The US aggressors and their lackeys, under the banner of the "Souphanouvong government," have shamelessly used US Air Force planes for the past three years, and for the past year, have even used B-52 strategic bombers to bomb and spread chemical poisons daily. The Vientiane puppet government, in foreign affairs, is increasingly colluding with the reactionary regimes of the American satellite countries to maintain Washington's aggressive and warlike stance, opposing the movements of the peoples of the world, first and foremost the peoples of Southeast Asia, for national independence, peace, democracy, and social progress.

	The statement pointed out that the Vientiane puppet regime has become a tool of US imperialism and will continue to slide down this path, striving to help the US implement "special warfare" against the people and patriotic forces. This puppet regime is increasingly exposing its weak nature. Its internal strife is becoming increasingly sharp. Souphanouvong's so-called "cabinet reshuffle" in June 1967 attempted to achieve a compromise among the various lackeys. However, the puppet regime has not stabilized as the Americans hoped, but is sliding down the path of disintegration.

	The statement said: In the liberated areas of Laos, the people's power is increasingly strengthened, the people are more united, and the people's lives are continuously improving in all aspects. The patriotic armed forces are growing stronger, and together with the people, they have smashed the attacks and various sabotage activities of the US and its lackeys; the prestige and status of the Lao Patriotic Front and the patriotic neutral forces in the international arena are also continuously improving. The facts fully prove that the enemy is suffering more and more defeats, and our people are achieving greater and greater victories. However, the more the Americans suffer defeats, the more they become obstinate and reckless. At present, they are frantically preparing for new military adventures, first targeting the central and southern regions of Laos, in conjunction with their plans to expand the war of aggression to the entire Indochina Peninsula. This situation requires the patriotic armed forces and all the people of our country to be vigilant at all times and be prepared to resolutely smash any new aggression and adventurism by the Americans.

	The statement said that the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front strongly condemns and severely denounces the crimes of US imperialism and its lackeys in shamelessly sabotaging the national unity government and the Geneva Agreement on the Laos issue.

	The statement called on the people of Laos in the liberated areas and the areas under US control to further unite, vigorously promote the struggle against the US imperialists and their lackey traitor clique, in order to smash their plans to expand the current war, expose the betrayal of the Vientiane puppet government and the US policies implemented by Souphanouvong; maintain and consolidate the liberated areas, and develop the achievements of our people in the patriotic struggle against the US and its lackeys.

	The statement finally said: Relying on the unity of all nationalities in our country, relying on the iron will of our people in the struggle against the US and to save the country, and with the increasing sympathy and support of the peace-loving people of the world, our people will surely establish a peaceful, independent, neutral, democratic, unified, and prosperous Laos. The US imperialists' new colonialist policy of aggression and "special warfare" in our country will surely suffer a thorough defeat.

    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会向全体人民发出号召
    团结一致　加强战斗　打败美帝
    新华社康开二十二日电　据巴特寮电台广播：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会最近发表公报，号召老挝人民进一步团结起来，为反对美帝国主义及其走狗扩大侵略战争的计划而坚决斗争。
    公报说：在过去的五年里，美帝国主义者为了利用傀儡政权这一工具在老挝推行“特种战争”，千方百计地通过他们的走狗、右翼头目们和梭发那·富马亲王来破坏三方民族团结政府。美帝国主义者操纵了萨纳尼空一库帕拉西反动集团，策划一九六四年四月十九日的万象政变，以推翻三方民族团结政府和建立在名义上由梭发那·富马亲王“主持”的目前所谓的万象“政府”。事实上，富马政府不过是美国人的不折不扣的傀儡。这个傀儡通过各种最阴险卑鄙的手段有步骤地把爱国的正副大臣和仅仅因为没有同帝国主义的走狗有联系的政府成员排挤出去。
    公报强调说：老挝爱国战线党中央委员会再一次重申，所谓的“富马政府”，不管它披上什么伪装，永远是一个非法的政府，是美国人的一个傀儡；老挝人民唾弃出卖祖国的这个政府，这个傀儡政府的言论和行动完全无效，美帝及其走狗——富马亲王等人，必须对他们所造成的后果承担全部责任。
    公报说：在国内和在对外关系方面，“富马政府”仅仅充当听命于美国佬的角色。在国内，这个政府为了加紧推动侵略战争以及使人民贫困化，为反动的美国政策服务，并使美国人能够为所欲为地践踏老挝的主权和独立，把美伪控制的地区变成美国的新殖民地，变成为美国人继续进行侵略我国的战争和继续实行奴役我国人民的计划提供人力和物力的基地。美国侵略者及其走狗打着“富马政府”的招牌，近三年来，无耻地使用美国空军的飞机，一年来，甚至使用B—52型战略轰炸机，每天进行轰炸，撒放化学毒剂。万象傀儡政府在对外方面，日益同美国卫星国家的反动当局紧密勾结，以便维护华盛顿的侵略和好战立场，反对世界各国人民，首先是东南亚地区人民争取民族独立、和平、民主和社会进步的运动。
    公报指出，万象傀儡政权充当了美帝的工具，并且还要继续滑下去，竭力帮助美帝推行“特种战争”来反对人民和爱国力量。这个傀儡政权日益暴露出它的虚弱的本质。它的内讧不断尖锐化。富马在一九六七年六月进行所谓“内阁改组”，企图实现各派走狗之间的妥协。但是，傀儡政权并没有象美国人所希望的那样稳定下来，而是在分崩离析的下坡路上滑下去。
    公报说：在老挝解放区，人民政权日益加强，人民越来越团结，人民的生活在各方面都不断得到改善，爱国武装力量日益壮大，同人民齐心协力地粉碎了美帝及其走狗的袭击和各种阴谋破坏活动；老挝爱国战线党和爱国中立力量在国际上的威望和地位也不断提高。事实充分证明，敌人日益惨败，我国人民赢得了越来越大的胜利。可是，美国人越是遭受失败，就越加执迷不悟和冒险。目前，他们正在疯狂地准备新的军事冒险，矛头首先指向中下寮，配合他们把侵略战争扩大到整个印度支那的计划。这种形势要求爱国武装力量和我国全体人民在任何时候都不能放松警惕，相反随时准备好坚决粉碎美国人的任何新侵略和冒险。
    公报说，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会，强烈谴责和严正声讨美帝国主义及其走狗无耻地破坏了民族团结政府以及关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的罪行。
    公报号召解放区和美伪控制区的老挝全国人民进一步团结起来，大力促进反对美帝国主义者及其走狗叛徒集团的斗争，以便粉碎他们扩大目前战争的计划，揭露万象傀儡政府的背叛和梭发那·富马所执行的美国政策；维护和巩固解放区，发展我国人民在反对美帝及其走狗的爱国斗争中所取得的成果。
    公报最后说：依靠我国各民族的团结一致，依靠我国人民在抗美救国斗争中的钢铁般的意志，而且在日益得到全世界爱好和平人民的同情和支持的情况下，我国人民必将建立一个和平的、独立的、中立的、民主的、统一的和繁荣的老挝。美帝国主义者在我国推行的新殖民主义的侵略政策和“特种战争”必将遭到彻底的失败。
