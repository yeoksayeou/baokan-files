The U.S. "Challenge" newspaper, the organ of the Progressive Labor Party, recently published an article criticizing the Soviet revisionist leadership for acting as the lackeys of U.S. imperialism and betraying the interests of revolutionary peoples. The article states: "The Soviet leaders are the biggest counter-revolutionaries in history."

The article, in discussing the recent meeting between Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin and Johnson in the U.S. to plot counter-revolutionary schemes, pointed out that their meeting was "directed against all revolutionary peoples, especially against China. China is the fortress of world revolution."

The article points out that while U.S. imperialism is intensifying its aggression in the Vietnam War, Kosygin held "harmonious and beneficial" talks with Johnson. This is obviously because the heroic Vietnamese people are striking heavy blows at the U.S. aggressors every day, and Johnson is in urgent need of the Soviet revisionists to help him carry out his "peace talks" plot. The Soviet revisionists, in turn, need to collude with U.S. imperialism to sabotage the revolution, because the revolution threatens the rule of revisionism.

The article states that imperialism and revisionism both want to stop the revolution, and they collude to achieve this goal.

The article points out that all peoples seeking liberation and fighting against imperialism must not cooperate with the Soviet revisionist traitors. The more "aid" they receive from them, the sooner and the greater the setbacks they will suffer.

The article states that all actions of the Soviet revisionists must be regarded as counter-revolutionary. This includes the "aid" they provide. They provide "aid" only to advance the interests of the Soviet revisionist bosses. "Aid" is used to control the actions of the recipient countries.

The article emphasizes that only the people's war proposed by Chairman Mao is "the best way for oppressed peoples to defeat imperialism." The struggle of the Vietnamese people has already proven the greatness and correctness of Chairman Mao's theory on people's war.

    美国《挑战》报指出苏联领导人是历史上最大的反革命
    苏修充当美帝帮凶出卖革命人民利益
    新华社伦敦十五日电　美国进步劳工党机关报《挑战》报最近发表文章，谴责苏联修正主义领导集团充当美帝国主义的帮凶，出卖革命人民的利益。文章说：“苏联领导人是历史上最大的反革命”。
    文章在谈到苏修头目柯西金最近在美国同约翰逊一起策划反革命阴谋时指出，他们的会议是“针对一切革命人民的，特别是针对中国的。中国是世界革命的堡垒”。
    文章指出，正当美帝国主义加紧进行侵略越南战争的时候，柯西金却同约翰逊举行“融洽和有益”的会谈。这显然是因为英雄的越南人民每天都在给美国侵略者以狠狠打击，约翰逊极为需要苏联修正主义者来帮助推行“和谈”阴谋，而苏修则需要伙同美帝国主义来破坏革命，因为革命威胁着修正主义的统治。
    文章说，帝国主义和修正主义都要阻止革命，并且勾结起来完成这个目标。
    文章指出，凡是要寻求解放，进行反帝斗争的人民，决不能同苏修叛徒合作，从他们得到的“援助”越多，遭受挫折就会越快、越大。
    文章说，必须把所有苏修的行动，看成是反革命的。这里包括他们提供的“援助”。他们提供“援助”，只是为了增进苏修老爷们的利益，“援助”是用来控制受“援”国的行动的。
    文章强调指出，只有毛主席提出的人民战争，“是被压迫人民能够打败帝国主义的最好的途径”。越南人民的斗争已经证明了毛主席关于人民战争的理论的伟大和正确。
