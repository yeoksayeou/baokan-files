An exhibition titled "Vietnamese People's Resistance Against American Aggressors" was inaugurated this morning at the Beijing Exhibition Hall. The event is jointly organized by the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade, the China Committee for the Promotion of Friendship with Foreign Countries, and the China-Vietnam Friendship Association.

The exhibition commemorates the first anniversary of Chairman Ho Chi Minh's issuance of the "Call to Arms." The displayed photographs are divided into four sections, each accompanied by quotations from Chairman Mao and remarks by Vice Chairman Lin Biao on people's war. The introductory part features a photograph of Chairman Mao meeting Chairman Ho and Chairman Mao's statement of August 1963, "Oppose the U.S.-Ngo Dinh Diem Clique's Aggression Against South Vietnam and Massacre of the South Vietnamese People," along with Chairman Ho Chi Minh's "Call to Arms" issued on July 17, 1966.

The exhibition vividly exposes the heinous crimes committed by American imperialism in its armed aggression against Vietnam. It introduces the glorious victories achieved in the struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation by the military and people of South and North Vietnam under the leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh. It also reflects the great support from Chairman Mao and the Chinese people for the Vietnamese people's struggle against U.S. aggression and for national salvation.

Today, the Beijing Exhibition Hall is filled with the spirit of combat friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam. The national flags of the two countries flutter in the wind at the entrance, and the walls of the exhibition hall are adorned with numerous plaques bearing Chairman Mao's quotations. At the entrance of the exhibition hall, portraits of Chairman Mao and Chairman Ho Chi Minh are hung, with a banner below them reading, "Long live the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam!" On either side of the portraits, banners proclaim, "Vietnam will win! The U.S. imperialists will be defeated!"

Those present at today's opening ceremony included Zhang Qixian, Director of the China Committee for the Promotion of International Trade, Han Nianlong, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yang Jie, Vice Chairman of the China Committee for the Promotion of Friendship with Foreign Countries, and Ding Xilin, Director of the China-Vietnam Friendship Association.
