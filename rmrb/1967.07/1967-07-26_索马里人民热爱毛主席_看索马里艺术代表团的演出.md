	At a time when the great storm of our country's revolutionary criticism is surging forward, and hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses are united in their hatred of the enemy, denouncing and attacking with both pen and sword, launching a decisive battle against the number one capitalist-roader in the Party, the cultural envoys of the people of East Africa—the Somali Artistic Delegation—came to the place where the reddest of the red suns in the hearts of the world's revolutionary peoples, our great leader Chairman Mao, resides. They came from across the ocean, from afar, to Beijing, to give us a splendid performance.

	Watching the performance by the Somali Artistic Delegation, we once again vividly felt the boundless love and boundless admiration that the Somali people and the people of Africa have for the great teacher of the world's revolutionary peoples, Chairman Mao. On stage, the Somali artists held up red copies of the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," wore shining Mao badges on their chests, and under the giant portrait of Chairman Mao, they sang with full emotion and in a familiar, pleasant national melody, praising Chairman Mao:

	You guide the Chinese people onto the correct path,
	You nurture them as they grow,
	Making China stand proudly among the nations of the world.
	You are the pride of the Asian and African peoples,
	Everyone knows of your greatness....

	This revolutionary song expresses the Somali people's sincere love for Chairman Mao.

	The Somali artists also sang Chinese songs such as "The East Is Red" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman" in Chinese, which became one of the most popular performances of the entire show. When the artists sang songs praising our great leader Chairman Mao, the emotions of the stage and the audience blended together. The Somali artists and the audience together raised their arms and shouted "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" once again expressing the shared wish of the Somali people and the people of the world.

	The Somali friends also used their sincere and pure performances to highly praise the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Somalia in their struggle against imperialism and old and new colonialism. The short play "Sino-Somali Friendship" used concise methods to trace the traditional friendly relations between the peoples of China and Somalia.

	In the song "Friendship," the Somali artists sang:

	There are two kinds of friends,
	One leads you to the right path,
	One gives you poison.
	For these two kinds of friends,
	We cannot treat them the same,
	We must distinguish between them,
	For the first kind of friend, we should be sincere.

	From this song, we see that the awakened Somali people understand "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends?" They realize that to achieve true independence and liberation, the peoples of Asia and Africa and all the revolutionary peoples of the world must unite tightly under the banner of anti-imperialism, and strike hard at American imperialism and those false friends—the traitors to the revolutionary cause of the Asian and African peoples, the Soviet revisionist leadership clique!

	In summary, through the performance of the Somali Artistic Delegation, not only did we further understand the struggle of the Somali people, but it will also further promote cultural exchanges between our two peoples and deepen the friendship between the peoples of our two countries. We warmly welcome the visit and performance of the Somali Artistic Delegation in China and wish the Somali artists success in their visit and performance in our country.

    索马里人民热爱毛主席
    ——看索马里艺术代表团的演出
    东方歌舞团全体革命同志
    正当我国革命大批判的怒涛滚滚向前，亿万革命群众同仇敌忾，口诛笔伐，向党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派发起总攻击的决战时刻，东非人民的文化使者——索马里艺术代表团怀着索马里和非洲人民对我们伟大领袖毛主席的热爱和对七亿中国人民的友谊，远渡重洋，万里迢迢，来到了世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席居住的地方——北京，为我们作了精彩的表演。
    看了索马里艺术代表团的演出，使我们再一次突出地感受到了索马里人民和非洲人民对世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席的无限热爱、无限敬仰的感情。舞台上，索马里艺术家们手捧红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，胸前佩戴着金光闪闪的毛主席像章，在毛主席的巨幅画像下面，以饱满的感情和亲切动听的民族曲调，放声歌唱毛主席：
    您引导中国人民走上正确的道路，
    您抚育他们成长，
    使中国昂然屹立于世界民族之林。
    您是亚非人民的骄傲，
    人人皆知您的伟大。……
    这首革命的歌曲表达了索马里人民对毛主席无比热爱的真挚感情。
    索马里艺术家们用汉语演唱的《东方红》、《大海航行靠舵手》等中国歌曲，成为整个演出中最受欢迎的节目之一。当艺术家们演唱歌颂伟大领袖毛主席的歌曲的时候，台上台下的感情完全融合在一起了。索马里艺术家们和观众们一起，不停地振臂高呼“毛主席万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”再一次表达了索马里人民和世界人民共同的心愿。
    索马里的朋友们，还用他们真挚、淳朴的表演，高度赞颂了中索两国人民在反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义斗争中结成的战斗友谊。短剧《中索友谊》用简练的手法追溯了中索两国人民传统的友好关系。
    索马里艺术家在歌曲《友谊》中唱道：
    有两种朋友，
    一种把你引向正道，
    一种给你下毒药。
    对于这两种朋友，
    我们不能一视同仁，
    我们应把他们各相区别，
    对第一种朋友，我们应坦诚相待。
    从这首歌曲中，我们看到觉醒了的索马里人民懂得了“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？”认识到要获得真正的独立和解放，亚非各国人民和全世界革命人民必须在反帝的旗帜下紧紧地团结起来，狠狠地打击美帝国主义和那些冒牌的朋友——亚非人民革命事业的叛徒苏修领导集团！
    总之，通过索马里艺术代表团的演出，不仅使我们进一步了解到索马里人民的斗争生活，而且还将进一步促进我们两国人民文化交流和增进两国人民的友谊。我们热烈欢迎索马里艺术代表团的访华演出，并预祝索马里艺术家们在我国访问演出成功。
