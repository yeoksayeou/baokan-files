Our embassy has issued the most urgent and strongest warning to the reactionary government of Burma, demanding that they immediately halt their bloody hands. The Chinese people will not tolerate the Ne Win government continuing to commit atrocities. Our government is closely observing their words and actions and will take corresponding measures.

	New China News Agency, July 15th: Yangon reports; On the 13th, the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Burma sent a note to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, issuing the most urgent, strongest, and most solemn warning to the reactionary government of Burma to immediately stop all fascist atrocities regarding the serious crime of illegally arresting a large number of patriotic overseas Chinese!

	The note states that the reactionary government of Burma has committed heinous fascist atrocities, owing countless blood debts to the 700 million Chinese people. This blood debt will definitely be settled. The reactionary government of Burma has carried out horrifying massacres, mass arrests, looting, arson, and destruction against patriotic overseas Chinese. Your evil and despicable actions prove that you are going further and deeper down the path of anti-China and anti-Chinese policies. The Chinese government and people are observing your words and actions and will definitely take corresponding measures.

	The note states that the reactionary government of Burma has already illegally arrested a large number of patriotic overseas Chinese, and this crime cannot be covered up. We have repeatedly warned you to make honest confessions, but you have ignored our warnings and continued to arrest overseas Chinese. Among the hundreds and thousands of arrested overseas Chinese are: Chen Bofu, Chen Tianhuang, Yang Laoqing, Lin Chenglong, Huang Zhongquan, Wang Weizhong, Liu Yingchao, Dong Chuanshi, Wen Nian, Ruan Yongtang, Wang Lianfa, Ren Shangbin, Zhang Shuhong, Lin Tuyang, Zhao Zhuoling, Huang Sihua, Zeng Guangbin, Li Jinbiao, Chen Qingfa, Su Quncai, Xu Yuanzhi. These are just a few names we are mentioning to warn you to stop while you can.

	The note states that we also know that you have prepared a blacklist and plan to continue mass arrests. You not only plan to continue your atrocities in Yangon but also in all parts of Burma. We sternly ask you: Are you determined to be ruthless and unrepentant? We issue the most urgent, strongest, and most solemn warning to you: You must immediately stop your bloody hands! Immediately stop the illegal mass arrests! Immediately stop all fascist atrocities! Immediately and unconditionally release all arrested overseas Chinese! Otherwise, you will bear all the serious consequences that arise from this. The embassy's note once again solemnly reminds the reactionary government of Burma: The Chinese people always keep their word. The blood debts you have committed will be settled. The Chinese people will not allow you to continue your atrocities. Any new fascist atrocities will be paid back double.

    我使馆最紧急最强烈警告缅甸反动当局必须立即停住血手
    中国人民决不容奈温政府继续行凶作恶
    我政府正在察其言观其行定将采取相应措施
    新华社十五日讯　仰光消息；中华人民共和国驻缅大使馆十三日照会缅甸外交部，就缅甸反动政府非法逮捕大批爱国华侨的严重罪行，最紧急、最强烈、最郑重地警告缅甸反动政府必须立即停止一切法西斯暴行！
    照会说，缅甸反动政府犯下了滔天的法西斯暴行，对七亿中国人民欠下了数不清的血债，这笔血债是一定要进行总清算的。缅甸反动政府对爱国华侨进行骇人听闻的大屠杀、大逮捕、大抢劫、大焚烧、大破坏。你们罪恶的卑鄙行径，证明了你们在反华排华的道路上越走越远，越陷越深。中国政府和中国人民正在察你们的言，观你们的行，并且一定要采取相应措施。
    照会说，缅甸反动政府已经非法逮捕了大批爱国华侨，这种罪行是掩盖不了的。我们曾几次向你们提出警告，要你们做出老实交代。但你们一直置之不理，背着我们继续逮捕华侨，在成百上千的被捕华侨中有：陈伯甫、陈天煌、杨老清、林成隆、黄忠泉、王维中、刘应超、董传溪、温年、阮咏棠、王莲发、任尚斌、张树洪、林土扬、赵钊铃、黄思华、曾广斌、黎锦镳、陈清发、苏群才、许元镖。这不过是向你们点几个名字，警告你们要悬崖勒马。
    照会说，我们也知道，你们已经拟好了黑名单，准备继续进行大逮捕。你们不仅策划在仰光继续下毒手，而且要在全缅各地大下毒手。我们要严词质问你们：你们是不是要蛮下横心，死不回头？我们最紧急地、最强烈地、最郑重地警告你们：你们必须立即停止血手！立即停止非法大逮捕！立即停止一切法西斯暴行！立即无条件释放所有被捕的华侨！否则，你们要承担由此而引起的一切严重后果。中国大使馆的照会再一次郑重地提醒缅甸反动政府：中国人民从来就是说话算数的，你们所犯下的血债都是要清算的，中国人民决不容许你们再继续行凶作恶，任何新的法西斯暴行，都要双倍偿还。
