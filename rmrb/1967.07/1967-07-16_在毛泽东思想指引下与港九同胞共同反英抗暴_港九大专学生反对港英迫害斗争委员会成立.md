	Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, fighting against British oppression together with the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon, the "Hong Kong and Kowloon College Students' Struggle Committee Against British Oppression" was solemnly established. Students from various colleges and universities have taken action. Yesterday, more than 800 patriotic students took to the streets to demonstrate and march.

	The British imperialists have always used Hong Kong and Kowloon colleges and universities as strongholds to implement slave education, to instill decadent Western culture, and to carry out religious indoctrination. Now, these strongholds are beginning to be breached. On the 14th, more than 200 patriotic student representatives from various colleges and universities held a meeting and solemnly established the "Hong Kong and Kowloon College Students' Struggle Committee Against British Oppression." They declared that under the leadership of the "Hong Kong and Kowloon Students' Struggle Committee Against British Oppression" and guided by the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, they would fight together with the people of Hong Kong and Kowloon to achieve victory in the struggle against British oppression.

	The "Hong Kong and Kowloon College Students' Struggle Committee Against British Oppression" issued a statement and a "Letter to All Students in Hong Kong." The statement pointed out: The broad masses of young students are gradually rising up to join the workers and peasants, taking to the front lines of the struggle. We college students must stand at the forefront of the revolutionary ranks, fight our way out from the enemy's heart, smash the shackles of slave education and reformism to smithereens, thoroughly shatter the enemy's hopes in us, and create chaos within the enemy's ranks.

	The "Letter to All Students in Hong Kong" issued four calls to action: First, intensify the study of Chairman Mao's works; second, all patriotic students in Hong Kong should unite in revolution; third, mobilize the masses; fourth, learn the revolutionary spirit of daring to think, speak, and act from the Red Guards. The "Letter to All Students in Hong Kong" also called on students to be in Hong Kong but have their hearts in the motherland, and to look at the world, to carry on the struggle against British oppression to the end.

	In the afternoon of the 14th, 800 students from "government-funded," "subsidized," and patriotic schools in Hong Kong's Eastern District held a demonstration and march. The procession, with banners and slogans, drums, and gongs, marched forward in an orderly manner. Along the way, they pasted big-character posters on the walls of the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's Causeway Bay branch and wrote big-character slogans on the streets with red paint. The sky was filled with anti-British oppression leaflets. Slogans such as "Patriotism is not a crime! Resistance is justified!" "Down with British imperialism!" "Smash slave education!" "The British will be defeated! We will be victorious!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" and revolutionary songs like "The Great Sea Voyage Needs a Helmsman," "Strive for Victory," and "All Reactionaries Are Paper Tigers" echoed through the streets of Hong Kong.

	In the afternoon of the 14th, 12 representatives from Po Chai Middle School, including teachers, staff, and family members of those who had been persecuted, went to the "Governor's Residence" to strongly protest the illegal arrest of four teachers and staff members by the British fascist authorities. The representatives strongly demanded that the British authorities immediately release the detainees.

	In the afternoon of the 15th, more than 1,000 patriotic teachers and students in Hong Kong's Central and Western Districts held another massive demonstration and march. The patriotic teachers and students, holding numerous portraits of Chairman Mao, quotations from Chairman Mao, and protest signs, marched along the seaside. At this moment, the roars of anger pierced the sky.

    在毛泽东思想指引下与港九同胞共同反英抗暴港
    九大专学生反对港英迫害斗争委员会成立
    据新华社香港十五日电　正当轰轰烈烈的反英抗暴斗争进入一个新高潮的时候，“港九大专学生反对港英迫害斗争委员会”庄严宣告成立，广大学生纷纷行动起来，昨天有八百多名爱国学生走上街头示威游行。
    港英帝国主义一贯把港九大专院校作为实施奴化教育，灌输西方腐朽文化，进行宗教麻醉的顽固堡垒，现在，这些顽固堡垒开始被冲破了。十四日，各大专院校二百多名爱国学生代表举行了大会，庄严成立“港九大专学生反对港英迫害斗争委员会”，宣告在“港九学生界反对港英迫害斗争委员会”的领导下，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的指引下，与港九同胞共同战斗，夺取反英抗暴斗争的胜利。
    “港九大专学生反对港英迫害斗争委员会”发表了声明和《告全港同学书》。委员会发表的声明指出：广大青年学生已经逐渐起来与工农结合，走上斗争的第一线。我们大专学生更要站在革命队伍的前头，从敌人的心脏里杀出来，把一切奴化教育、改良主义的枷锁砸个稀巴烂，彻底粉碎敌人在我们身上的希望，大造敌人的反，在敌人内部搞它个天翻地覆。
    《告全港同学书》发出了四项号召：一、加紧学习毛主席著作；二、全港爱国学生要进行革命大联合；三、放手发动群众；四、学习红卫兵敢想敢说敢闯的革命大无畏精神。《告全港同学书》还号召同学们身在香港，心怀祖国，放眼世界，把反英抗暴斗争进行到底。
    十四日下午四时，香港东区八百名港英“官立”、“津贴”、“补助”学校和爱国学校的学生，举行了示威游行。游行队伍打着横幅标语，敲锣打鼓，浩浩荡荡地前进，他们沿途在港英开设的汇丰银行铜锣湾分行的墙上张贴大字报，在马路上用红油漆写上大字标语，天空中还同时出现了反英抗暴传单，“爱国无罪！抗暴有理！”“打倒英帝国主义！”“粉碎奴化教育！”“港英必败！我们必胜！”“毛主席万岁！”的口号声，和《大海航行靠舵手》、《争取胜利》、《一切反动派都是纸老虎》的革命歌声，震撼了香港的上空。
    十四日下午，培侨中学师生、职工及受迫害的家属代表十二人，前往“总督府”强烈抗议港英法西斯当局非法逮捕该校教师员工四人的暴行。代表们强烈要求港英当局必须立即释放被捕者。
    十五日下午，香港中区和西区一千多爱国师生，又一次举行了声势浩大的示威游行。爱国师生们举着无数的毛主席像、毛主席语录牌和抗议标语，沿着海边前进，这时，激昂的怒吼声直冲云霄。
