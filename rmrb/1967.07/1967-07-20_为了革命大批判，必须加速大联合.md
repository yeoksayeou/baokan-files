For the revolution's great criticism, we must accelerate the great unity.

The clique within the party that takes the capitalist road and holds power has been exposed, and has become a despicable "fallen dog," with its former arrogance completely swept away. The situation is excellent, and it truly feels unprecedentedly satisfying! But have they been thoroughly defeated? No! Have they confessed their crimes? No! Have they given up? No! The struggle is still very sharp!

"All reactionary forces, if you do not hit them, they will not fall." Without carrying out the revolution's great criticism, can the clique within the party that takes the capitalist road and holds power be thoroughly defeated? No! They must be severely criticized, thoroughly criticized politically, ideologically, and theoretically, to be criticized deeply and thoroughly, to be criticized and exposed! Otherwise, the "fallen dog" will crawl back to the shore and carry out a counter-revolutionary restoration. At that time, it will not be just the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, but a bloody counter-revolutionary coup, and thousands and tens of thousands of heads will fall. History will take a great turn, and the Chinese revolution and the world revolution will suffer losses!

The enemy never forgets to restore power, so we must never forget the enemy and never forget to prevent restoration!

How can the clique within the party that takes the capitalist road and holds power be thoroughly defeated? Mainly by uniting the revolutionary forces and uniting the revolutionary people of the whole country.

Great unity has always been the battle flag of the proletarian revolution and the source of the proletarian's strength. Marx issued the great call "Workers of the world, unite!" more than a hundred years ago. Chairman Mao pointed out the correct direction of "the great unity of the masses" nearly fifty years ago. The proletariat forming the broadest alliance with all revolutionary and would-be revolutionary people to thoroughly isolate and annihilate counter-revolutionary forces has always been Chairman Mao's great strategic thought. Every victory achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is a victory of the united struggle of the revolutionary forces.

Without the revolution's great unity, it is impossible to carry out the great criticism, and it is impossible to isolate and defeat the clique within the party that takes the capitalist road and holds power. The great unity is urgent.

Although there are still this or that difference within our revolutionary forces, compared to the contradiction between us and the clique within the party that takes the capitalist road and holds power, these are extremely minor contradictions. The clique within the party that takes the capitalist road and holds power is our greatest enemy! If we relax our criticism of them, if one day they come back to power, they will arrest and kill all those who opposed them, regardless of which "faction" they are in within the revolutionary forces!

The enemy is at the gate, and we have a thousand and ten thousand reasons to unite. If we do not quickly unite all revolutionary forces, if we still divide the revolutionary forces into "factions" and fight "internal wars" for the interests of small groups, it will hinder the great criticism, commit historical errors, and that will be a crime against the revolution and a betrayal of the proletariat!

We often say: "Small reasons serve the big reason," "Seek the big commonality and tolerate small differences." What is the big reason? What is the big commonality? To carry out the great criticism and great struggle against the clique within the party that takes the capitalist road and holds power and thoroughly defeat them. This is the most important matter related to where China is going and where the world is going.

"A new social system must be established on the foundation of the old system, and it must clear away this foundation." The duty of the proletarian revolutionary forces is to criticize the old world and the bourgeoisie. The clique within the party that takes the capitalist road and holds power is the total representative of the bourgeoisie in our country, a pile of thoroughly rotten garbage. Can we still let it hide in the dark corners and rot and spread poison? It is time to take up the iron broom and sweep it away completely! All revolutionary forces unite to thoroughly eliminate its poison in all fields and let the great thought of Mao Zedong occupy all positions!

    为了革命大批判，必须加速大联合
    清华大学井冈山兵团  蒋家羚  仇国平  叶志江
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派被揪了出来，成了丑态百出的“落水狗”，昔日威风，扫地以尽。形势大好，真叫人感到从未有过的痛快！但是，他们彻底完蛋了吗？没有！他们伏罪了吗？没有！他们死心了吗？没有！斗争还很尖锐呢！
    “凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”不开展革命的大批判，能把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派彻底打倒吗？不能！必须大批特批，从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批深批透，批倒批臭！否则，“落水狗”就会爬上岸来，实行反革命复辟。到那时，可不单是资产阶级反动路线了，而是血腥的反革命政变，就会有千百万人头落地，历史就要来一个大曲折，中国革命和世界革命将会遭受损失！
    敌人念念不忘复辟，我们就要念念不忘敌人，念念不忘反复辟！
    怎样才能把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派彻底打倒呢？主要靠我们革命派联合起来，靠全国革命人民联合起来。
    大联合，从来就是无产阶级革命的战斗的旗帜，也是无产阶级力量的所在。马克思早在一百多年以前就发出了“全世界无产者联合起来”的伟大号召。毛主席早在将近五十年前就指引了“民众的大联合”的正确方向。无产阶级同一切革命的和要革命的人们结成最广泛的联盟，彻底孤立和消灭反革命势力，从来就是毛主席的伟大战略思想。无产阶级文化大革命所取得的每一个胜利，都是革命派联合战斗的胜利。
    没有革命的大联合，就不可能搞好大批判，就不能孤立和打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。大联合刻不容缓。
    尽管在我们革命派内部还有这样或那样的分歧，但是这与我们和党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾相比较，都是极端次要的小小矛盾。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派才是我们最大的死敌！要是我们放松了对他们的批判，要是有朝一日让他们卷土重来，凡是造他们反的，都要抓，都要杀，他才不管你是革命派里的哪一“派”呢！
    大敌当前，我们有一千条一万条理由联合起来。如果我们还不迅速把一切革命力量联合起来，还要在革命派内部分“派别”，打“内战”，为小团体争权夺利，那就会妨碍大批判，犯历史性的错误，那就是对革命犯罪，对无产阶级背叛！
    我们常说：“小道理服从大道理”，“求大同，存小异”。什么是大道理？什么是大同？对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开展大批判、大斗争，把他们彻底打倒。这就是最大的道理，就是我们的大同。这是关系到中国向何处去，世界向何处去的头等大事。
    “一个崭新的社会制度要从旧制度的基地上建立起来，它就必须清除这个基地。”无产阶级革命派的天职就是批判旧世界，批判资产阶级，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是资产阶级在我国的总代表，是一堆腐朽透顶的垃圾堆。我们还能让它躲在阴暗角落里发霉放毒吗？是抡起铁扫帚，把它一扫而光的时候了！一切革命力量联合起来，彻底肃清它在各个领域的流毒，让伟大的毛泽东思想占领一切阵地！
