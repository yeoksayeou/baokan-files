Ivory Coast Authorities, with UN Complicity, Illegally Kidnap Guinean Delegation

President Touré Denounces Ivory Coast Authorities' Piratical Acts

Our Chargé d'Affaires in Guinea Meets with Guinea's Foreign Ministry Secretary-General to Denounce Imperialist Political Intrigues

	NEW YORK, July 4 — CONAKRY, Guinea: On June 30, Guinea's President Sékou Touré issued a statement on Guinea's "Voice of the Revolution" radio, condemning the Ivory Coast authorities for illegally kidnapping a Guinean delegation passing through Abidjan, the capital of Ivory Coast, with the complicity of the United Nations.

	The Guinean delegation, led by Guinea's Foreign Minister Lansana Beavogui, was returning from a United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting in New York. Their plane, operated by KLM Royal Dutch Airlines, made an unscheduled stop in Abidjan on June 26.

	In his statement, President Touré demanded that the United Nations and the Dutch government take responsibility for the kidnapping of the Guinean delegation. He stated, "Our representatives were invited by the United Nations to attend the meeting, and their round-trip tickets were arranged by the United Nations." He also announced that the Guinean government had taken corresponding measures to detain the Dutch diplomatic representative in Guinea and the KLM manager in Conakry.

	President Touré stated that the Ivory Coast government's kidnapping of the Guinean delegation was a blatant violation of international law and a piratical act.

	President Touré also pointed out that the Ivory Coast government had remained silent about the kidnapping of the Guinean delegation until it received instructions from Paris, acknowledging this crime. He condemned France as an accomplice in this incident.

	NEW YORK, July 5 — CONAKRY, Guinea: On July 1, Lin Bingnan, the Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Guinea, met with Diallo Abdoulaye, the Secretary-General of Guinea's Foreign Ministry, in Conakry. He expressed concern and sympathy for the Guinean delegation, led by Foreign Minister Lansana Beavogui, which was illegally kidnapped by the Ivory Coast authorities on their way back from New York. He also strongly condemned the political intrigue and piratical acts orchestrated by imperialism.

    新华社四日讯　科纳克里消息：几内亚总统塞古·杜尔六月三十日在几内亚“革命之声”电台发表声明，谴责象牙海岸当局在联合国纵容下非法绑架路过象牙海岸首都阿比让的几内亚代表团。
    由几内亚外交部长朗萨纳·贝阿沃吉率领的几内亚代表团是在纽约参加联合国大会紧急会议后，乘荷兰航空公司飞机回国途中于六月二十六日在阿比让机场停留的。这架飞机是临时改变航程在阿比让着陆的。
    杜尔总统在声明中，要求联合国和荷兰政府对几内亚代表团被绑架一事负责。他说，我们的代表是应联合国要求去开会的，往返机票又是由联合国安排的。他还宣布，几内亚政府已经采取相应的措施，扣留了荷兰驻几内亚的外交代表和荷兰航空公司在科纳克里的负责人。
    杜尔总统说，象牙海岸政府绑架几内亚代表团是一个粗暴践踏国际法的海盗行径。
    杜尔总统还指出，象牙海岸政府曾对绑架几内亚代表团保持沉默，一直等到巴黎的指示后才承认这一罪行。他谴责法国是这一事件的同谋者。
    新华社五日讯　科纳克里消息：中国驻几内亚大使馆临时代办林秉南七月一日在科纳克里会见了几内亚外交部秘书长迪亚洛·阿卜杜拉耶，对从纽约回国途中被象牙海岸当局非法绑架的由几内亚外交部长朗萨纳·贝阿沃吉率领的几内亚代表团，表示关切和慰问，并对帝国主义策划的这一政治阴谋和海盗行径表示极大的愤慨。
