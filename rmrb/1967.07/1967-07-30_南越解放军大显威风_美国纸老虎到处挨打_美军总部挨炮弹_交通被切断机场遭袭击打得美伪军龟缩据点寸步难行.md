The Liberation Army of South Vietnam Shows Its Might; The U.S. Paper Tiger Takes Beating After Beating

The U.S. Military Headquarters Takes a Shelling; Transportation Cut Off, Airfield Attacked, Driving the U.S. Puppet Forces to Retreat to Their Bases, Unable to Move an Inch

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 26th, the military and people of My Tho Province in South Vietnam, from the 17th to the 20th, destroyed all enemy strategic transportation lines passing through My Tho Province and launched fierce attacks on the U.S. puppet forces on these lines, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses.

According to preliminary reports, all strategic transportation lines in My Tho Province have been completely cut off by local military and people, rendering them paralyzed. In particular, a 70-kilometer section of Highway 4 from My Thuan Commune to Tan Phu Commune has been cut into 80 segments by guerrilla forces and local people, with hundreds of obstacles set up, making it impossible for enemy vehicles to pass. The military and people of My Tho Province also launched fierce attacks on enemy strongholds along the transportation lines, making the enemy so frightened that they could only hide in their bases and strongholds, daring not to come out for a long time.

Shelling the U.S. Military Headquarters, Inflicting Heavy Casualties on the Enemy

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 28th, news from Saigon: On the night of the 26th, the liberation armed forces of South Vietnam launched a fierce artillery attack on the headquarters of the U.S. invading forces' 1st Infantry Division, 1st Brigade, and simultaneously attacked the nearby Phu Loi Airfield.

According to Western news agencies, during this attack, the shells of the liberation armed forces accurately hit the location of the headquarters of the U.S. 1st Division, 1st Brigade, and the airfield, killing and wounding many American aggressors and destroying facilities and equipment on the airfield.

Fiercely Attacking Enemy Strongholds, Severely Punishing American Aggressors

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi on the 29th, the artillery forces of the liberation armed forces in Quang Tri Province, South Vietnam, to punish the American aggressors who once again dispatched B-52 bombers to bomb the northern part of the demilitarized zone and the Vinh Linh area on the 26th, immediately launched a fierce attack on the U.S. strongholds in Yuthe and Kontum as soon as the enemy planes finished their bombing.

The shells fired by the liberation armed forces accurately hit the targets, causing the two U.S. strongholds to catch fire and burn, and triggering fierce explosions. Many American invaders were killed before they could get out of their shelters.

Raid on U.S. Airfield, Destroying American Aircraft

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on the 29th, news from Saigon: On the morning of the 29th, the liberation armed forces of South Vietnam launched a fierce artillery attack on a large U.S. Army helicopter base—Phu Loi Airfield, located 24 kilometers north of Saigon, causing the enemy to suffer heavy casualties and losses.

According to Western news agencies, the artillery attack by the liberation armed forces lasted for 50 minutes, with shells raining down on the airfield, destroying a batch of helicopters. Some American pilots attempted to escape in their aircraft, but were quickly shot down by ground artillery. In this attack, dozens of American invaders were also killed and wounded.
