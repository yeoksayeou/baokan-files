Before liberation, my father was an underground Party worker. Once, the higher-ups gave him nearly forty rifles to organize a guerrilla unit. Later, due to a traitor's betrayal, the enemy captured my father and pressed a bayonet to his chest, demanding, "Do you want to live or do you want the guns?" My father resolutely replied, "I want the guns!" Thus, my father sacrificed his life to protect the revolutionary guns.

Why did my father use his life to protect the revolutionary guns? Because he firmly remembered Chairman Mao's teaching that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." He saw that the enemy's butcher knives had pushed millions of laboring people to the brink of death. The revolutionary people must take up arms to fight the enemy, to destroy the enemy, to seize power, and to liberate themselves.

The book "Self-Cultivation" does not mention armed struggle at all but advocates that the revolutionary people should "use their own hands to transform their own country." This is all deceitful talk! The several decades of revolutionary struggle by the Chinese people have proven that without armed struggle, without guns, it is absolutely impossible to "transform one's own country."

When Chiang Kai-shek was slaughtering the Chinese people, the Communist Party of China led the people to take up arms and bravely fight back. The author of "Self-Cultivation" kept shouting, "All political issues must be resolved peacefully." The facts are clear: this self-proclaimed "old revolutionary" has been a lackey of imperialism and Chiang Kai-shek for more than twenty years!

Under Chairman Mao's leadership, the Chinese people used guns to win New China. However, the author of "Self-Cultivation" did not stop there. He advocated that "after achieving victory," one must "patiently and persistently carry out the transformation of society and economy, and of ideology and culture," still not mentioning the real class struggle, not mentioning the dictatorship of the proletariat. Chairman Mao taught us: "The imperialists and their running dogs, the Chinese reactionaries, will not reconcile themselves to their defeat in China. They will still collude with each other and use all possible means to oppose the Chinese people." In the seventeen years since the founding of New China, the domestic and foreign class enemies have never stopped their sabotage and disruption. If we did not have a powerful army and a powerful militia, the class enemies would never allow the Chinese people to "patiently and persistently" build the country, and the Chinese people would never be able to build the country. Even if the construction were very good, in the end, it would be plundered by them. The author of "Self-Cultivation" wants the proletariat, which has seized power, to only hold the hoe, forget the gun, and let the class enemies seize the power.

To defend the dictatorship of the proletariat, we need revolutionary guns; to build a socialist society, we need revolutionary guns; to liberate all the people of the world, we also need revolutionary guns. The people have handed over to us the guns that the martyrs exchanged with their blood and lives. We must defend them with our blood and lives. I will take my father as an example: my head can be cut off, my blood can flow, but the revolutionary guns will never be discarded!

    革命的枪杆子永不丢
    五好战士　杨泽民
    解放前，我爸爸是党的地下工作者。有一次，上级发给他四十几条枪，要他组织游击队。后来，由于叛徒的出卖，敌人把我爸爸抓去，用刺刀逼着他的胸口问：“要命还是要枪？”我爸爸坚定地回答：“要枪！”就这样，爸爸为了保护革命的枪杆子，英勇地献出了自己的生命。
    爸爸为什么要用生命保护革命的枪杆子？因为他牢记着毛主席“枪杆子里面出政权”的教导。他看到敌人的屠刀已逼得千百万劳动人民活不下去，革命人民必须拿起枪来跟敌人拚，才能消灭敌人，夺取政权，解放自己。
    《修养》闭口不谈武装斗争，却要革命人民通过“自己的手，去改造自己的国家”，这完全是骗人的鬼话！中国人民几十年革命斗争的实践证明，离开了武装斗争，离开了枪杆子，绝对不能“改造自己的国家”。
    当蒋介石屠杀中国人民，中国共产党领导人民拿起枪奋勇反击的时候，《修养》作者连声叫嚷：“一切政治问题要和平解决”。事实十分清楚，这个自封为“老革命”的家伙，早在二十多年前就是帝国主义和蒋介石的帮凶！
    毛主席领导中国人民用枪杆子打出了新中国。但是《修养》作者并没有罢休，他又鼓吹“在取得胜利以后”，“要长期地耐心地进行社会经济的改造和思想文化的改造”，仍然闭口不谈现实的阶级斗争，闭口不谈无产阶级专政。毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者及其走狗中国反动派对于他们在中国这块土地上的失败，是不会甘心的。他们还会要互相勾结在一起，用各种可能的方法，反对中国人民。”新中国成立十七年来，国内外阶级敌人的破坏和捣乱，一天也没有停止过。如果不是我们有强大的军队，有强大的民兵，阶级敌人决不会让中国人民“长期地、耐心地”搞建设，中国人民也决不可能搞建设。即使建设得再好，最后也会被他们抢劫一空。《修养》的作者就是要夺取了政权的无产阶级，只握锄把子，忘掉枪杆子，让阶级敌人来夺印把子。
    保卫无产阶级的政权，要靠革命的枪杆子；建设社会主义社会，要靠革命的枪杆子；全世界人民的解放，也要靠革命的枪杆子。人民把烈士用鲜血和生命换来的枪杆子交给了我们，我们一定要用鲜血和生命来保卫它。我要以爸爸为榜样，头可断，血可流，革命的枪杆子永不丢！
