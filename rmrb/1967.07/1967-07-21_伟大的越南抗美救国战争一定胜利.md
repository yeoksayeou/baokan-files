The heroic Vietnamese people are conducting the great anti-American national salvation war with full confidence, achieving one brilliant victory after another.

One year ago, Chairman Ho Chi Minh solemnly declared in his "Call to Arms" that no matter how ferocious American imperialism is, "it cannot shake the iron will and determination of the heroic Vietnamese people to resist America and save the nation." He pointed out that the war could last five years, ten years, twenty years, or even longer, and that the Vietnamese military and people must "unite as one, endure hardships and sacrifices, and fight resolutely to the end." This is the common vow of the 31 million Vietnamese people to carry the anti-American national salvation war to the end.

Now, the situation of the Vietnam anti-American national salvation war is getting better and better. While the military and people in North Vietnam are annihilating American air pirates, the military and people in South Vietnam, after arduous battles, have smashed the second "dry season offensive" of the American invaders, achieving great victories. Comrade Long San recently wrote in an article for the Vietnamese magazine "People's Army" that this victory has brought the Vietnamese people a "more solid and better political and strategic situation than any previous period." This contains new factors, new abilities, and new premises for achieving and definitely achieving even greater victories.

In the battle to smash the second "dry season offensive" of the American invaders, the military and people in South Vietnam have continued to firmly grasp the initiative on the battlefield and expanded this initiative. In the Vietnam War, the American invaders, who have suffered repeated defeats, have always tried to seize the initiative on the battlefield from the Vietnamese people to reverse the situation. The Johnson administration deployed more than a million American and puppet troops to launch the second "dry season offensive," but failed to achieve this goal. Instead, they suffered an even more humiliating defeat, and the American invaders found themselves in an even more passive position of being beaten. This clearly shows that American imperialism cannot escape its fate of complete failure in Vietnam.

The military and people in South Vietnam have demonstrated the power of people's war, using flexible strategies and tactics, exploiting their strengths and attacking the enemy's weaknesses, forcing the enemy to disperse and suffer blows everywhere. The American invaders, with their modern equipment, are being beaten into a sorry state by the South Vietnamese military.

The military and people in South Vietnam have fully utilized the strategic roles of the main forces, local forces, and militia. They have closely coordinated their efforts, using various tactical forms and combat methods to continuously strike the enemy.

The military and people in South Vietnam have not only intensified their attacks on the enemy in the mountains and countryside but have also more frequently launched surprise attacks on the enemy's military bases and cities, catching the enemy off guard. This has played a very important role in wearing down and disintegrating the enemy's military and political forces.

The military and people in South Vietnam have now been able to annihilate the enemy in whole companies, whole battalions, and whole regiments, greatly reducing the enemy's combat effectiveness. According to incomplete statistics, the military and people in South Vietnam have annihilated 175,000 enemy troops in this dry season, including 70,000 American troops. The total number of American and puppet troops annihilated is 60,000 more than in the previous dry season.

The 14 million people of South Vietnam, fighting bravely on 170,000 square kilometers of land, have beaten the so-called strongest American invaders into a rout. This is an unprecedented feat in military history, a great deed of the Vietnamese nation, and a magnificent achievement that shakes heaven and earth.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out that only people's war can defeat the enemy of the nation. The Vietnam anti-American national salvation war is such a true people's war. The Vietnamese people have applied Chairman Mao's theory of people's war and strategies and tactics to their own battles and made their own great creations, setting another brilliant example of people's war. Their victories have tied down and annihilated a large number of American imperialist troops, disrupted the military deployments of American imperialism's counter-revolutionary global strategy, greatly boosted the confidence of the people of the world in their anti-American struggle, provided valuable experience for oppressed nations and peoples in their struggle against imperialism and its lackeys, and made a significant contribution to the world revolutionary cause.

The American invaders have suffered repeated defeats in South Vietnam, and they have increased their troops again and again. The troops they deployed in the second "dry season offensive" have already exceeded the level of the Korean War. The result is still failure. The American military leaders have racked their brains but found no other way than to increase troops. However, the American manpower is exhausted. The commander of the American troops in Vietnam, Westmoreland, and the U.S. Secretary of Defense, McNamara, have had fierce arguments over the number of troops to be increased. One wants more, the other cannot provide, and they are at loggerheads. This reflects that the American invaders are at their wits' end and have no way out. In fact, even if the Americans use the method of cannibalizing their own flesh to send a few more cannon fodder, what use would it be? Hasn't the fact proven that the more troops they increase, the more casualties they suffer, and the more humiliating their defeats?

The American invaders cannot win by fighting on, and they cannot endure a prolonged war. Their long front lines, distant rear areas, insufficient troops, low morale, and other fatal weaknesses will deepen as the war develops. The American imperialist giant, under the blows of the Vietnamese people, has more fully exposed its paper tiger nature.

At a time when the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war is achieving victory after victory and American imperialism is at its wits' end, the head of the Soviet revisionist clique, Kosygin, rushed to the United States to engage in a deal with the American imperialist head, Johnson, on the Vietnam issue. Subsequently, a group of American congressmen put forward a so-called "five-step plan" for "bombing halt and deception" in Vietnam, which is obviously a product of the Hollebush plot. Kosygin schemed and worked hard for the American imperialists' "peace talks" deception, which is the most blatant betrayal of the Soviet revisionist clique to the Vietnamese people.

This group of the most despicable traitors of the Soviet revisionist clique betrays the people's revolution everywhere and extinguishes the flames of the people's revolution. They frantically obstruct the oppressed peoples and nations from taking up arms to wage armed revolution. If someone has already taken up arms, they will do everything they can to make them lay down their arms and stop fighting; if someone's armed struggle has already achieved great victories, they will go mad and try to bury the fruits of the revolution's victory. They are the number one accomplice of American imperialism in suppressing the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries, the fire brigade for extinguishing the flames of revolutionary wars of the peoples of various countries, and the international gendarmes for strangling the revolutionary movements of the peoples of various countries. The role played by the Soviet revisionist clique in the Vietnam issue is exactly such a heinous role.

In the Vietnam issue, and on the international stage, there has always been a sharp and complex struggle between two lines. The Communist Party of China and the Chinese people, together with all Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary peoples of the world, adhere to the revolutionary line of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, firmly support the Vietnamese people in fighting the anti-American national salvation war to the end until they achieve final victory. The line pursued by the Soviet revisionist clique is a thoroughly counter-revolutionary line. They strive to help American imperialism carry out the "peace talks" plot, betray the revolutionary interests of the Vietnamese people, and try to extinguish the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war, bringing the Vietnam issue into the track of "Soviet-American cooperation."

The struggle between the two lines on the Vietnam issue is a concentrated reflection of the sharpening of international class struggle. Chairman Mao pointed out: "It is either the East Wind prevailing over the West Wind or the West Wind prevailing over the East Wind. There is no room for compromise on the line issue." To oppose imperialism, one must resolutely oppose the counter-revolutionary line of the Soviet revisionist clique. In the struggle between the two lines, the middle road is not passable.

Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "We are now in a new and great era of world revolution. The revolutionary storms in Asia, Africa, and Latin America will certainly deal a decisive and destructive blow to the entire old world. The great victory of the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war is a powerful proof of this."

Today, the revolutionary situation in Asia, Africa, and Latin America is excellent. Especially in Southeast Asia, revolutionary wars of national liberation and people's liberation are burning everywhere. This situation is extremely favorable for the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war. The heroic Vietnamese people, adhering to the revolutionary line and persistent struggle, will certainly be able to finally put the American invaders to death and achieve the complete liberation of the Vietnamese nation and the unification of the motherland.

We, the Chinese people, are close comrades-in-arms who share life and death with the Vietnamese people. Supporting the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war is a sacred internationalist duty of the Chinese people. The 700 million Chinese people are the strong backing of the Vietnamese people, and the vast territory of China is the reliable rear area of the Vietnamese people. In any stormy waves, the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought will unshakably stand together with the Vietnamese people and strive to drive the American invaders out of Vietnamese territory completely.

### 伟大的越南抗美救国战争一定胜利

    伟大的越南抗美救国战争一定胜利
    英雄的越南人民，正在满怀信心地进行着伟大的抗美救国战争，取得一个又一个辉煌的胜利。
    一年以前，胡志明主席在他的《号召书》中庄严宣告，不管美帝国主义怎样凶残，“绝不能动摇英雄的越南人民抗美救国的钢铁意志和决心”。他指出，“战争可以延长五年、十年、二十年或者更长的时间”，越南军民都要“团结一致，不怕艰苦、牺牲，坚决战斗到彻底胜利”。这是三千一百万越南人民决心把抗美救国战争进行到底的共同誓愿。
    现在，越南抗美救国战争的形势越来越好。在越南北方军民痛歼美国空中强盗的同时，南越军民经过艰苦战斗，粉碎了美国侵略者的第二个“旱季攻势”，取得了伟大的胜利。长山同志不久以前在为越南《人民军队》杂志写的文章指出，这一胜利给越南人民明显地“带来了比过去任何时期都更加稳固和良好的政治和战略局面，这里面蕴藏着争取并且肯定能够取得加倍巨大的胜利的新的因素、新的能力和新的前提”。
    南越军民在粉碎美国侵略者的第二个“旱季攻势”的战斗中，继续牢牢地掌握着战场上的主动权，并且扩大了这个主动权。在侵越战争中不断遭受失败的美国侵略者，一直妄图从南越人民手中夺取战场上的主动权，来扭转败局。约翰逊政府投入一百万以上的美伪军，发动第二个“旱季攻势”，依然不能达到这个目的，相反的却败得更惨，美国侵略军陷入了更为被动挨打的地位。这就清楚地表明，美帝国主义根本无法摆脱它在越南彻底失败的命运。
    南越军民发挥了人民战争的威力，运用了机动灵活的战略战术，以己之长，攻敌之短，迫使敌人陷于分散，到处挨打，而美国侵略军对解放军的主力，想摸也摸不着，打也打不上。就是这样，南越军民把具有现代化装备的美国侵略军打得狼狈不堪。
    南越军民充分地发挥了主力部队、地方部队和民兵三种武装力量的战略作用。它们密切配合，以各种战术形式和作战方式，不断打击敌人。
    南越军民不仅在山区和农村加强对敌人的攻击，而且更加频繁地奇袭敌人的军事基地和城市，使敌人经常遭到出乎意料的打击。这对消耗和瓦解敌人的军事和政治力量，起着十分重要的作用。
    南越军民现在已经能够整连、整营、整个战团地消灭敌人，大量地歼灭敌人的有生力量。据不完全统计，南越军民在这个旱季中，共消灭了敌人十七万五千名，其中美军达七万，被消灭的美伪军总数比上个旱季增加了六万。
    一千四百万越南南方人民，在十七万平方公里的土地上英勇抗战，把号称世界上最强大的美国侵略者打得落花流水。这是战争史上的奇观，越南民族的壮举，惊天动地的伟业。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出，只有人民战争，才能战胜民族敌人。越南人民抗美救国战争就是这样一场真正的人民战争。越南人民把毛主席的人民战争理论和战略战术，具体地运用于他们自己的战斗实践，并且作出了自己伟大的创造，树立了人民战争的又一个光辉榜样。他们的胜利，牵制和消灭了美帝国主义的大量兵力，打乱了美帝国主义反革命全球战略的军事部署，大大地鼓舞了全世界人民反美斗争的信心，为被压迫民族和被压迫人民战胜帝国主义及其走狗的斗争提供了宝贵的经验，对世界革命事业作出了重大贡献。
    美国侵略者在南越一败再败，它就一次再次地增加兵力。它在第二个“旱季攻势”中所投下的兵力，已经超过了侵略朝鲜战争的水平。结果，还是遭到失败。美国军事头目们苦思苦想，没有别的出路，还是那一条：增加兵力。可是，美国的兵源枯竭。侵越美军头子威斯特摩兰和美国国防部长麦克纳马拉在增兵的数量上，发生了激烈的争吵。一个要得多，一个拿不出，闹得不可开交。这反映了美国侵略者已经山穷水尽，一筹莫展。其实，即使美国用挖肉补疮的办法，再送几万炮灰，又有什么用呢？难道事实没有证明它增兵越多，伤亡越大，败得越惨吗？
    美国侵略者打下去，不能取胜，长期拖下去，也受不了。它的战线长，后方远，兵力不足，士气低落等等这些致命的弱点，必将随着战争发展不断加深。美帝国主义这个庞然大物，在越南人民的打击下，它的纸老虎的本质更加充分暴露了。
    正当越南人民抗美救国战争节节胜利，美帝国主义走投无路的时候，苏修集团头子柯西金，跑到美国，同美帝国主义头子约翰逊，在越南问题上大搞交易。随后，美国一批议员就抛出了一个对越南实行“停炸诱和”的所谓“五步骤方案”，这显然是霍利布什阴谋的产品。柯西金为美帝国主义“和谈”骗局出谋划策，奔走效劳，这是苏修集团对越南人民的最露骨的叛卖。
    苏修集团这一伙最卑鄙的叛徒，到处出卖人民革命，到处扑灭人民革命的烈火。它们拚命阻挠被压迫人民和被压迫民族拿起武器进行武装革命。如果人家已经拿起了武器，它们就千方百计地要人家放下武器，停止战斗；如果人家的武装斗争已经取得了伟大的胜利，它们就丧心病狂地设法葬送人家的革命胜利的成果。它们是美帝国主义镇压各国人民革命斗争的头号大帮凶，是扑灭各国人民革命战争烈火的消防队，是绞杀各国人民革命运动的国际宪兵。苏修集团在越南问题上所扮演的，就是这样一个罪大恶极的角色。
    在越南问题上，在国际范围内，一直存在着两条路线的尖锐复杂的斗争。中国共产党和中国人民，同全世界的马克思列宁主义者和革命人民一道，坚持马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的革命路线，坚决支持越南人民把抗美救国战争打到底，直到取得最后胜利。苏修集团奉行的，是一条彻头彻尾的反革命路线，它们竭力帮助美帝国主义推行“和谈”阴谋，出卖越南人民的革命利益，力图扑灭越南人民的抗美救国战争，把越南问题纳入“苏美合作”的轨道。　
    在越南问题上的两条路线的斗争，是国际阶级斗争尖锐化的集中反映。毛主席指出：“不是东风压倒西风，就是西风压倒东风，在路线问题上没有调和的余地。”要反对帝国主义，就必须坚决反对苏修集团的反革命路线。在两条路线的斗争中，中间道路是走不通的。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“我们现在正处于世界革命的一个新的伟大的时代。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲的革命风暴，定将给整个的旧世界以决定性的摧毁性的打击。越南人民抗美救国战争的伟大胜利，就是一个有力的证明。”
    今天，亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲的革命形势大好。尤其是在东南亚，到处都燃起了民族革命战争和人民革命战争的烽火。这种形势，对于越南人民的抗美救国战争空前有利。英雄的越南人民坚持革命路线，坚持持久战，就一定能够把美国侵略者最后置于死地，就能够赢得越南民族的彻底解放和祖国的统一。
    我们中国人民是与越南人民同生死、共患难的亲密战友。支援越南人民抗美救国战争，是中国人民神圣的国际主义义务。七亿中国人民是越南人民的坚强后盾，中国的辽阔国土是越南人民的可靠后方。在任何惊涛骇浪中，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民，都将坚定不移地同越南人民团结在一起，为把美国侵略者从越南土地上全部赶出去而奋斗。
