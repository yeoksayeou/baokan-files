Miyazaki Seimin Condemns the Mad Anti-China Atrocities of the Reactionary Burmese Government and Fully Supports the Just Struggle of Chinese Personnel in Burma

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency on July 1st, the East Asia News Agency reported: Miyazaki Seimin, a standing committee member of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), issued a statement on the 30th, expressing full support for the just struggle being bravely waged by Chinese personnel in Burma.

Miyazaki strongly condemned the reactionary Burmese government for inciting and directing mobs to brutally slaughter overseas Chinese and Chinese personnel in Burma, demanding that the Burmese government immediately stop the persecution of overseas Chinese and Chinese personnel, punish the culprits, and absolutely guarantee their safety and property.

Miyazaki pointed out that after the right-wing military regime in Indonesia, the British authorities in Hong Kong, and the reactionary government of India, the Burmese government has committed such a shocking event, completely in line with the needs of the anti-China plot by U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism. He said that U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries fear the great Mao Zedong Thought that guides the people of the world to wage liberation struggles, and thus they create anti-China backlashes in various places.

Miyazaki quoted Chairman Mao's words, emphasizing that: "All the oppression and persecution inflicted on the revolutionary people by imperialism and reactionaries will, in the long run, only serve to promote more extensive, more fierce, and more determined revolutionary struggles."

He said that the people of various Asian countries are determined to stand shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese compatriots and personnel in Burma, and jointly smash the evil plots of imperialism and reactionaries in various countries.

　　宫崎世民谴责缅甸反动政府疯狂反华暴行
　　完全支持中国驻缅工作人员的正义斗争
    据新华社一日讯　据东方通讯社报道：日中友好协会（正统）总部常任理事宫崎世民三十日发表谈话，表示完全支持中国驻缅甸工作人员正在英勇地进行的正义斗争。
    宫崎强烈谴责缅甸反动政府唆使和指挥暴徒野蛮地残杀华侨和中国驻缅甸的工作人员，要缅甸政府立即停止对华侨和中国工作人员的迫害，严惩凶手，绝对保证他们的生命和财产的安全。
    宫崎指出，缅甸政府继印尼右派军人政权、香港英国当局和印度反动政府疯狂反华之后，制造了这样骇人听闻的事件，完全是为了适应美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义策划的反华的需要。他说，美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和各国反动派，害怕指引全世界人民进行解放斗争的伟大的毛泽东思想，因而它们在各个地方制造反华逆流。
    宫崎引用毛主席的话，强调指出：帝国主义和反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”
    他说，亚洲各国人民决心同在缅甸的中国侨民和工作人员并肩战斗，共同粉碎帝国主义和各国反动派的罪恶企图。
