Zimbabwean guerrillas recite Chairman Mao's "Sixteen Character Formula" before going into battle.

	CAIRO, July 9 (Xinhua) -- A representative of the Zimbabwe African National Union, Mr. Mbejisela, recently told a Xinhua News Agency correspondent that "our struggle has once again proven the correctness of Chairman Mao Zedong's teachings: 'Without a people's army, there is nothing for the people.' 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.'"

	He emphasized, "I especially want to thank Chairman Mao. It is Chairman Mao's brilliant thoughts that have shown us the correct direction for our struggle."

	He confidently said, "The people of Zimbabwe are more determined than ever to win independence through armed struggle and rely on their own strength to defeat British imperialism and the colonial regime of the white minority."

	Mbejisela stressed, "As Chairman Mao said, 'Revolutionary war is the people's war. Only by mobilizing the people can we wage war, and only by relying on the people can we wage war.' We are doing more work among the people, and with the broader mobilization and participation of the people, we will surely win, and the enemy will surely lose."

	He said, "It is inspiring that when I recently visited one of our training camps, I found that all the guerrillas recite Chairman Mao's famous 'Sixteen Character Formula' ('The enemy advances, we retreat; the enemy camps, we harass; the enemy tires, we attack; the enemy retreats, we pursue') before going into battle. I believe that applying Chairman Mao Zedong's thoughts in practice is the guarantee of our final victory."

　　津巴布韦游击战士出击之前
    背诵毛主席的“十六字诀”
    新华社开罗电　津巴布韦非洲民族联盟代表门贝朔腊不久前向新华社记者发表谈话说：“我们的斗争再一次证实了毛泽东主席的英明教导：‘没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。’‘枪杆子里面出政权’。”
    他强调说：“我要特别感谢毛主席，是毛主席的光辉思想给我们指出了斗争的正确方向。”
    他满怀信心地说：“津巴布韦非洲人民比以往任何时候更加有决心通过武装斗争和依靠自己的力量来赢得独立，打败英帝国主义和少数白人的殖民主义政权。”
    门贝朔腊强调说：“正如毛主席所说的：‘革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。’我们正在群众中间进行更深入的工作，凭着群众的更广泛的动员和参加，紧紧依靠群众，我们必胜，敌人必败。”
    他说：“令人鼓舞的是，当我不久以前参观我们的一个训练营时，我发现，所有游击战士在出战以前都尽量背诵毛主席著名的十六字诀（“敌进我退，敌驻我扰，敌疲我打，敌退我追”）。我认为，实际运用毛泽东主席的思想是我们取得最后胜利的保证。”
