In March of this year, we participated in the "Support Agriculture" work. The production brigade we went to had two mass organizations. One of them was very enthusiastic towards us, providing us with many conveniences in work and life. During labor, their attendance rate was high; during meetings, they spoke actively. These phenomena made us feel that they were like a revolutionary faction. Thus, we developed a favorable impression of this faction, while having less contact with the other faction and being less receptive to their words.

Later, during the election of the temporary production leadership team in the brigade, some people wrote the name of one person twice on a ballot. This incident sparked a heated debate between the two factions and caught our attention. Chairman Mao said in "On Practice": "Sensory materials are indeed reflections of certain truths of objective external things," but "they are only one-sided and superficial things. This reflection is incomplete and does not reflect the essence of things."

We used Chairman Mao's teachings to examine our work and felt that our investigations and research were too superficial. After arriving at the production brigade for just a few days, we only saw some surface phenomena of the factional struggle and had not yet seen through the phenomena to the essence of class struggle. We only conducted subjective and one-sided investigations and had not yet conducted objective and comprehensive investigations. We only understood some fragmentary information and did not understand the history and the entire situation of these matters. In this way, we could not draw a correct conclusion about the situation here, nor could we determine our struggle strategy and work guidelines. Therefore, we decided to continue conducting systematic, thorough, and comprehensive investigations and research. We broadly contacted the masses and continuously used Chairman Mao's views on class analysis to "remove the dross and select the essential, remove the false and retain the true, go from one thing to another, and go from the surface to the essence" to analyze and study the materials we obtained.

Through the investigation, we finally, together with the broad revolutionary masses of the brigade, uncovered the cover of class struggle here. It turned out that at the crucial moment when the revolutionary masses across the country were seizing power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, the rich peasants and the cadres who were removed during last year's "Four Clean-ups" movement in this brigade thought that "the time had come." They colluded with each other, using clan consciousness to deceive and win over some brigade members, attempting to seize the leadership of the production brigade again. This handful of bad elements, in order to realize their ambitions, even resorted to despicable means during the election of the temporary production leadership team in the brigade, manipulating the deceived masses to cast multiple votes for their people.

This segment of the "Support Agriculture" struggle practice gave us a profound education. Chairman Mao said: "Without investigation, there is no right to speak." In the practice of class struggle, conducting superficial and perfunctory investigations of social conditions, lacking comprehensive and in-depth investigations and research, one cannot gain the right to speak. In order to correctly understand the world and the laws of class struggle in the practice of revolutionary struggle, one must enter the practice of struggle, observe, analyze, and study various complex phenomena, and then draw conclusions. Conducting only subjective, one-sided, and superficial investigations can only lead to one-sided or even wrong conclusions.

    做周密的调查　求正确的结论
    沈阳部队某部“红九连”班长　苏锦文
    今年三月，我们参加了“支农”工作。我们去的这个生产队，存在着两个群众组织。其中一个对我们很热情，工作和生活上给了我们不少方便。劳动时，他们的出勤率高；开会时发言也很积极。这些现象，使我们觉得他们象个造反派的样子。于是，我们就对这一派有了好感；而对另一派则接触较少，对他们的话也有点听不进去。
    后来，在选举队里的临时生产领导班子的时候，有些群众在一张选票上两次写上一个人的名字。这件事，引起了两派间激烈的论战，也引起了我们的注意。毛主席在《实践论》中说：“感觉材料固然是客观外界某些真实性的反映”，
  “但它们仅是片面的和表面的东西，这种反映是不完全的，是没有反映事物本质的。”我们用毛主席的教导检查了自己的工作，感到我们的调查研究太肤浅了。来到生产队刚几天，只看到了两派斗争的一些表面现象，还没有透过现象看到阶级斗争的实质。只是主观、片面地找一方调查，还没有客观地、全面地做调查；只了解一些片断情况，还不了解这些事情的历史和全部现状。这样，对这里的情况就不能得出正确的结论，也就不能决定我们的斗争策略和工作方针。于是我们决定继续进行系统的、周密的、全面的调查研究。广泛接触群众，不断地用毛主席关于阶级分析的观点，对得来的材料进行“去粗取精、去伪存真、由此及彼、由表及里”的分析研究。经过调查，我们终于和队里的广大革命群众一起，把这里的阶级斗争的盖子揭开了。原来，在全国无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权的关键时刻，队里的富农分子和在去年“四清”运动中下台的干部，认为“时机已到”，就串通一气，利用宗族观念，蒙蔽、拉拢了一些社员群众，企图重新夺取生产队的领导权。这一小撮坏家伙，为了实现他们的野心，在队里选举临时生产领导班子的时候，竟不惜采用卑鄙的手段，操纵受蒙蔽的群众为他们的人投重票。
    这一段“支农”斗争的实践，使我们受到深刻的教育。毛主席说：“没有调查就没有发言权”。在阶级斗争的实践中，对社会状况只做浮皮潦草的调查，缺乏全面的深入的调查研究，就不能取得发言权。我们要想在革命斗争的实践中，正确地认识世界，认识阶级斗争的规律，只有深入到斗争的实践中，观察、分析、研究各种复杂的现象，然后得出结论。只做主观的、片面的、表面的调查，就只能得出片面的甚至错误的结论。
