Our correspondent in Burma, Yu Minsheng, who has returned from Burma with great honor, held a press conference for both Chinese and foreign journalists today in Beijing. In his speech, he enthusiastically celebrated the armed struggle of the Burmese revolutionary people, which, under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, is continuously growing and expanding. He declared that the Ne Win reactionary government is now surrounded by the people's war and its days are numbered.

Yu Minsheng, in his speech, strongly denounced and protested against the Ne Win reactionary government for instigating thugs to insult our dearest leader, the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, and strongly condemned the Ne Win reactionary government for committing bloody anti-China and anti-people fascist atrocities. He strongly denounced and protested against the Ne Win reactionary government for directing thugs to attack our embassy in Burma, the Xinhua News Agency's office in Rangoon, and other Chinese institutions, injuring our diplomatic personnel, killing our experts assisting Burma, and strongly denounced and protested against the Ne Win reactionary government for committing heinous crimes of mass slaughter, mass arrests, mass burning, and mass looting against our patriotic overseas Chinese throughout Burma. He strongly protested against the Ne Win reactionary government for imposing illegal military control over the Chinese embassy and the Chinese community in Rangoon, sealing off the Chinese embassy with heavy troops, and completely restricting the movement of our embassy personnel. Yu Minsheng pointed out that all these facts show that the fascist leader of Burma, the Chiang Kai-shek of Burma—Ne Win—is the chief culprit of anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiment.

Yu Minsheng pointed out that the Ne Win government's frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiment is determined by its reactionary class nature. He said, especially since China launched the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the Ne Win reactionary clique is even more enraged and terrified by the immense influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the boundless spread of Mao Zedong Thought in Burma. They are deeply afraid that the Burmese revolutionary people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, learning from the example of the Chinese Red Guards, and under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party, will rise up to overthrow their rule and rebel against them. Therefore, the Burmese reactionaries have done everything possible to slander and attack the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, attempting to counteract the influence of this great revolution in Burma, and have done everything possible to obstruct the spread of Mao Zedong Thought in Burma. However, this is like a mantis trying to stop a chariot or an ant trying to shake a tree. When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China is increasingly victorious, and when the number one capitalist-roader within the party is exposed and criticized nationwide, this Burmese fascist leader, Ne Win, has revealed his true colors. He lamented that the overthrow of China's Khrushchev has made him "lose the intermediary connecting him with China," fearing that the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao will triumph, fearing that China will strengthen its support for the revolutionary struggles of the world's people, and fearing the great development of the Burmese Communist Party.

Yu Minsheng said that the Burmese fascist leader Ne Win and his reactionary government's rampant anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiment is not accidental but is based on their needs in domestic and foreign policies. Internally, it is to divert the attention of the Burmese people from the increasingly sharp class contradictions within the country. Externally, it is to cater to the needs of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, and is a part of the anti-China tide internationally. This is the result of the long-term implementation of the reactionary domestic policy of anti-communism and anti-people by the Ne Win reactionary ruling clique, and the result of the implementation of the reactionary foreign policy of currying favor with U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and colluding with reactionaries of various countries.

He said that when the Ne Win reactionary ruling clique launched the anti-China and anti-Chinese wave, it was precisely when it was facing military, political, and economic bankruptcy. The people's armed forces led by the Burmese Communist Party, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and Comrade Lin Biao's "Long Live the Victory of People's War," using the strategies and tactics of guerrilla warfare, are everywhere flexibly and agilely striking and annihilating the enemy, continuously developing and expanding their own forces, and have become the main force threatening the survival of the Ne Win military regime. According to incomplete statistics, the Burmese people's revolutionary armed forces conducted over 400 battles in 1966, increasing their revolutionary armed forces by 50%, and the battle zones cover more than 60% of Burma's total area. Now, the revolutionary armed forces can mobilize more than 500 to 600 troops in a single battle to attack medium and small towns. The Ne Win reactionary government is surrounded by the people's war and is suffering increasingly heavy blows. The broad masses of the Burmese people have completely seen through and spit on Ne Win's fake socialism and have completely recognized the traitorous face of this Chiang Kai-shek of Burma—Ne Win. The Ne Win reactionary clique is facing the opposition of the entire nation, is extremely unpopular, and is extremely isolated politically. The fake socialism implemented by the Ne Win reactionary government has long brought serious economic crises to Burma. Now, the Ne Win reactionary government is like sitting on top of a volcano, having a very hard time. He said that the Ne Win reactionary government's creation of bloody anti-China and anti-Chinese incidents has personally torn off its so-called "neutral" foreign policy mask and has taken the road of openly pro-imperialist, pro-revisionist, and anti-Chinese treachery. The anti-China incidents it created are themselves to curry favor with U.S. imperialism and its number one lackey, the Soviet revisionist clique, and this is a thorough exposure of its ruthless fascist counter-revolutionary nature.

Yu Minsheng said, our great leader Chairman Mao said: "'Lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own feet,' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some stupid people. The reactionaries of various countries are also such a bunch of stupid people. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the final analysis, only promote the broader and more intense revolution of the people." The Ne Win reactionary government's anti-communism and anti-people domestically, and pro-U.S. imperialism and pro-Soviet revisionism and anti-China internationally, can only be self-immolation and hasten its own doom.

We must solemnly warn the Ne Win reactionary government that the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be insulted, and our overseas Chinese compatriots are not to be insulted. Blood debts must be fully settled, and those who are anti-China will not have a good ending. We solemnly declare that Xinhua News Agency is a proletarian news agency that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. It will forever support the revolutionary struggles of the people of all countries in the world and forever support the revolutionary struggle of the Burmese people led by the Burmese Communist Party. The Ne Win reactionary government can unreasonably expel Xinhua News Agency correspondents, but it cannot shake the principle of Xinhua News Agency supporting the revolutionary struggle of the Burmese people. Ne Win will be defeated, and the Burmese Communist Party will be victorious!

In answering questions from Chinese and foreign journalists, Yu Minsheng listed many moving facts, introducing the Burmese people's boundless love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and introducing the influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the Red Guard movement in China on Burma. He said that the broad revolutionary people of Burma have boundless love and respect for our great leader Chairman Mao, and boundless admiration and faith in the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The deep affection they express for Chairman Mao is indescribable. They say: One can read any book except Chairman Mao's books; one can have anything except Mao Zedong Thought. A friend in the education sector said: "Today, revolutionary people around the world are looking up to Beijing, the holy land of world revolution, and looking up to Mao Zedong, the red sun that illuminates the globe. Today, people of all countries in the world who want revolution, want struggle, want to oppose imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries, must read Chairman Mao's books. Chairman Mao's books are an inexhaustible treasure trove of theory. Every sentence in Chairman Mao's works is truth!" A writer said: "Chairman Mao is the most respected great leader of the world's revolutionary people. Today, every victory achieved by the world's revolutionary people in their struggle against imperialism and revisionism is inseparable from the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. In today's world, whoever supports Mao Zedong Thought is a true revolutionary, and whoever opposes Mao Zedong Thought is an enemy of the revolutionary people."

Burmese workers say: Chairman Mao's works are a priceless treasure for the world's revolutionary people, a guide to action for revolutionary people, and a powerful ideological weapon for the world's people to wage revolutionary struggles. The great helmsman of the world revolutionary ship is the great Mao Zedong! We will forever advance in the revolutionary direction indicated by Chairman Mao!

In Burma, the broad revolutionary people of Burma are eager to study Chairman Mao's works. They consider obtaining a copy of Chairman Mao's works, obtaining a portrait of Chairman Mao, or obtaining a Chairman Mao badge as the greatest happiness and the most meaningful memento. Many Burmese friends organize and plan to read Chairman Mao's works every day, and if there are no books, they copy them by hand. Many Burmese friends have portraits of Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought plaques hanging in their homes, and many friends carry "Quotations from Chairman Mao" with them. Whenever they encounter a problem, they find the answer in "Quotations from Chairman Mao." Many friends can fluently recite Chairman Mao's quotations. Many friends, when meeting with Chinese comrades, repeatedly ask Chinese comrades to convey their sincere wishes to Chairman Mao, wishing the great leader Chairman Mao a long life!

Yu Minsheng said that the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that shook the world has had a tremendous, far-reaching, and extremely broad influence in Burma, and it will play an immeasurably great role in the revolutionary struggle of the Burmese people.

The broad revolutionary people and progressive friends in Burma have enthusiastically welcomed and cheered for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, feeling immensely inspired. They say that this great revolution, personally initiated and led by the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao, is a great innovation in the international communist movement, is Chairman Mao's greatest and most outstanding contribution to the international communist movement and the revolutionary cause of the world's people, and will greatly promote and drive the revolutionary cause of the world's people. Many Burmese friends believe that the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China will thoroughly smash the imperialists' and revisionists' dream of restoring capitalism in China, ensuring that China's proletarian rule will never change color for ten thousand generations, and making China, the center of world revolution, more powerfully support the revolutionary struggle of the Burmese people and the revolutionary struggle of the people of all countries in the world. Therefore, this unparalleled great revolution not only relates to the future and destiny of China but also relates to the future and destiny of the world revolution. The revolutionary people of Burma enthusiastically support and wholeheartedly support this great revolution. Many Burmese friends have also actively participated in the great criticism of China's Khrushchev's "Reminiscences" and exposed and denounced the great harm that "Reminiscences" has caused to the Burmese revolutionary cause. They pointed out that the more fiercely and thoroughly China's Khrushchev is fought, the more beneficial it is to the revolutionary cause of the world.

Yu Minsheng said that the broad workers, youth, and students in Burma have unlimited admiration for the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese Red Guards, unanimously believing that the Chinese Red Guards have set a brilliant example for the revolutionary youth of the world. They expressed their determination to learn from the example of the Chinese Red Guards, to follow the Burmese Communist Party to rebel against the Ne Win fascist regime, and to completely overthrow it and completely overthrow it, turning Burma into a new Burma shining with the brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought.

Yu Minsheng emphasized in his speech that he had a piece of good news to report: the Burmese Communist Party-led liberated areas have begun to organize the Red Guards.

In introducing the development of the Burmese people's revolutionary armed struggle, Yu Minsheng said that the Burmese Communist Party, led by Comrade De Bijan Dong, is leading the Burmese people in a great people's war. Since 1948, the Burmese Communist Party has always held high the banner of people's revolutionary war, insisting on revolutionary armed struggle, and its led people's armed forces have become increasingly powerful. Especially in the past year or so, there has been rapid development. Currently, the battle zones of the Burmese people's armed forces have expanded to most of Burma's territory.

He said that the people's revolutionary war in Burma has heavily struck the evil rule of the Ne Win reactionary government and struck the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists. This is another heroic march song of people's war echoing in Southeast Asia and another red flag of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought flying over the Asian continent.

Yu Minsheng said that the Burmese Communist Party firmly believes in the great truth pointed out by Chairman Mao that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" and "without a people's army, people have nothing." According to Chairman Mao's military thoughts, they are building a new type of people's army in Burma. The Burmese people's armed forces take Chairman Mao's military thoughts as their guide to action, take Chairman Mao's works as the main content of their study, and take the three main rules of discipline and eight points for attention personally formulated by Chairman Mao as the discipline that every soldier consciously observes. They gradually mastered Mao Zedong's theory of people's war and a complete set of strategies and tactics in battle.

The Burmese Communist Party, in battle, insists on relying on the masses, establishing rural base areas, and continuously consolidating and expanding the base areas. The Burmese Communist Party, with its long history of struggle, has shown the world that people's war has boundless vitality. It will definitely become stronger with each battle and ultimately overthrow the Ne Win reactionary government and win the complete liberation of the Burmese people.

Yu Minsheng's speech was warmly received with enthusiastic applause from the entire audience.

Those who attended today's press conference included Cao Dalin, our diplomatic courier who was injured by thugs instigated by the Ne Win reactionary government in Burma, Liu Yajin, the family member of Liu Yi, our expert assisting Burma who died a heroic death in the struggle against violence, Qin Jialin, Director of the News Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Wang Weizhen, Deputy Director of Xinhua News Agency, and others. The press conference was presided over by Lu Bin, First Secretary of the All-China Journalists Association.

    我驻缅记者于民生举行记者招待会欢呼缅共领导的武装斗争不断发展壮大
    缅甸革命人民无限热爱毛主席
    奈温反动政府对内反共反人民对外亲美联苏反华只能加速自己灭亡
    新华社二十八日讯  从缅甸光荣归来的新华社驻仰光分社记者于民生，今天在北京举行中外记者招待会。他在讲话中热烈欢呼缅甸革命人民的武装斗争，在高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的缅甸共产党的领导下不断发展壮大，奈温反动政府正处在人民战争的包围之中，它的日子不长了。
    于民生在讲话中，最最强烈声讨和抗议奈温反动政府唆使暴徒侮辱我们心中最红最红的红太阳、世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席，强烈谴责奈温反动政府制造血腥的反华排华的法西斯暴行，强烈声讨奈温反动政府指挥暴徒袭击我驻缅使馆、新华社仰光分社和其他中国机构，打伤我外交人员，杀害我援缅专家，强烈声讨和抗议奈温反动政府在缅甸全国对我爱国侨胞实行大屠杀、大逮捕、大焚烧、大洗劫的滔天罪行，强烈抗议奈温反动政府在仰光对中国大使馆和华侨集中区进行非法的军事管制，重兵封锁中国大使馆，使我使馆人员完全失去行动自由。于民生指出，一切事实说明，缅甸的法西斯总头目、缅甸的蒋介石——奈温是反华排华的罪魁祸首。
    于民生指出，奈温政府疯狂反华排华，是由它的反动的阶级本性决定的。他说，特别是从中国开展史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命以来，奈温反动集团对中国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响和光焰无际的毛泽东思想在缅甸的广泛传播，更恨得要命，怕得要死，他们深怕缅甸革命人民掌握了毛泽东思想，学习了中国红卫兵的榜样，在缅甸共产党的领导下，起来革他们的命，造他们的反。因此缅甸反动派千方百计地污蔑和攻击中国无产阶级文化大革命，妄图抵消这场大革命在缅甸的影响，千方百计地阻碍毛泽东思想在缅甸的传播。然而这不过是螳螂挡车、蚍蜉撼树而已。当中国无产阶级文化大革命日益胜利开展，揪出了党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派并在全国范围内对中国的赫鲁晓夫进行大批判的时候，奈温这个缅甸法西斯总头目更原形毕露，他发出悲鸣，说什么中国的赫鲁晓夫被打倒，使他“失去了同中国联系的牵线人”，他害怕以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线取得胜利，害怕中国要加强支持世界人民的革命斗争，害怕缅甸共产党大发展。
    于民生说，缅甸法西斯总头目奈温及其反动政府猖狂地反华排华，绝不是偶然的，是基于他们在内政和外交上的需要，对内转移缅甸人民对日益尖锐的国内阶级矛盾的视线，对外迎合美帝、苏修的需要，是国际上反华逆流的一个组成部分。这是奈温反动统治集团长期执行反共反人民的对内政策的结果，是它执行投靠美帝、苏修和勾结各国反动派的反动对外政策的结果。
    他说，奈温反动统治集团掀起反华排华浪潮的时候，正是它在军事上、政治上和经济上大破产的时候。缅甸共产党所领导的人民武装，活学活用毛主席的著作和林彪同志的《人民战争胜利万岁》，运用游击战争的战略战术，到处机动灵活地打击和消灭敌人，不断发展和壮大自己的力量，已变成了威胁奈温军人政权存亡的主要力量。据不完全统计，缅甸人民革命武装一九六六年共进行了四百多次战斗，革命武装力量发展了百分之五十，战斗地区占缅甸总面积的百分之六十以上。现在革命武装在一次战斗中已可以调动五六百人以上的兵力攻打中小城镇。奈温反动政府正处在人民战争的包围中，遭受着越来越沉重的打击。缅甸广大人民已彻底识破并唾弃了奈温的假社会主义，彻底认清了这个缅甸的蒋介石——奈温的卖国贼嘴脸。奈温反动集团正面临着全民的反对，政治上极不得人心，极为孤立。奈温反动统治集团所实行的假社会主义早已给缅甸带来了严重的经济危机。现在，奈温反动政府犹如坐在火山顶上，日子很不好过。他说，奈温反动政府制造血腥反华排华事件，亲手撕下了它的所谓对外“中立”政策的假面具，走上了公开亲帝联修卖国反华的道路。它所制造的反华事件本身就是为了讨好美帝国主义及其头号帮凶苏修集团，这是它穷凶极恶的法西斯反革命本性的彻底大暴露。
    于民生说，我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”奈温反动政府对内反共反人民，对外亲美帝，联苏修，反中国，只能是玩火自焚，加速自己的灭亡。
    我们要正告奈温反动政府，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民不可侮，我们的海外侨胞不可侮，血债一定要彻底清算，反华的人决不会有好下场。我们庄严地宣告，新华通讯社是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的无产阶级通讯社，它永远支持世界各国人民的革命斗争，永远支持缅甸共产党领导的缅甸人民的革命斗争。奈温反动政府可以无理驱逐新华社记者，但是它决不能动摇新华通讯社支持缅甸人民革命斗争的原则立场。奈温必败，缅共必胜！
    于民生在回答中外记者的提问时，列举大量动人事实，介绍了缅甸人民对毛主席和毛泽东思想的无限热爱，介绍了中国无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵运动在缅甸的影响。他说，缅甸广大革命人民对我们的伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱，无限尊敬，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想无限崇拜，无限信仰。他们对毛主席所表达的那种无限热爱的深情是难以描述的。他们说：什么书都可以不读，但毛主席的书不能不读；什么东西都可以不要，但毛泽东思想不能不要。一位教育界朋友说：“今天世界革命人民都仰望着北京，这世界革命的圣地，仰望着毛泽东，这普照全球的红太阳。今天世界各国人民，要革命，要斗争，要反对帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派，就必须读毛主席的书。毛主席的书是取之不尽用之不竭的理论宝库。毛主席的著作，句句是真理！”一位作家说：“毛主席是世界革命人民最敬爱的伟大领袖，今天世界革命人民在反帝反修斗争中所取得的每一个胜利，都同战无不胜的毛泽东思想分不开的。在当代的世界上，谁拥护毛泽东思想，谁就是真正的革命者，谁反对毛泽东思想，谁就是革命人民的敌人。”
    缅甸工人们说：毛主席的著作是世界革命人民的无价之宝，是革命人民的行动指南，是世界人民进行革命斗争的强大思想武器。大海航行靠舵手，世界革命航船的伟大舵手就是伟大的毛泽东！我们要永远沿着毛主席所指引的革命方向前进！
    在缅甸，广大缅甸革命人民如饥似渴地学习毛主席著作。他们把能得到一部毛主席著作，得到一幅毛主席像，得到一枚毛主席像章，看作是最大的幸福和最有意义的纪念。许多缅甸朋友有组织有计划地天天读毛主席著作，没有书，他们就用手抄。许多缅甸朋友家里挂着毛主席的像和毛主席语录牌，许多朋友都随身带着《毛主席语录》，一遇到问题，就从《毛主席语录》中找答案。许多朋友能熟练地背诵毛主席语录。许多朋友在同中国同志会见时，一再请中国同志转达他们对毛主席的衷心祝愿，祝伟大领袖毛主席万寿无疆！
    于民生说，震动全世界的史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命，在缅甸产生了巨大的深远的极为广泛的影响，它将对缅甸人民的革命斗争起着不可估量的巨大作用。
    缅甸广大革命人民和进步朋友，对中国无产阶级文化大革命是一片欢呼一片叫好声，感到无限欢欣鼓舞。他们说，由世界人民的伟大领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的这场大革命，是国际共产主义运动的伟大创举，是毛主席对国际共产主义运动和世界人民的革命事业最伟大、最卓越的贡献，对全世界人民的革命事业将起着巨大的促进和推动作用。许多缅甸朋友认为，伟大的中国无产阶级文化大革命，将彻底粉碎帝国主义和修正主义企图在中国复辟资本主义的迷梦，保证了中国无产阶级的江山千秋万代永不变色，使世界革命中心的中国，更强有力地支持缅甸人民的革命斗争和世界各国人民的革命斗争。因此，这场举世无双的大革命，不仅关系到中国的前途和命运，而且关系到世界革命的前途和命运。缅甸革命人民热烈拥护和全力支持这场大革命。许多缅甸朋友还积极参加了对中国的赫鲁晓夫的《修养》的大批判，揭发和控诉了《修养》对缅甸革命事业的极大危害。他们指出，对中国的赫鲁晓夫斗得越狠越臭，对《修养》批得越彻底，对世界革命事业就越有利。
    于民生说，缅甸的广大工人、青年、学生对中国的红卫兵小将的革命造反精神，无限钦佩，一致认为中国的红卫兵小将为世界革命青年树立了光辉的榜样。他们纷纷表示，缅甸青年要学习中国红卫兵的榜样，跟着缅甸共产党起来造奈温法西斯政权的反，决心把它彻底打倒，彻底推翻，把缅甸变成闪耀着毛泽东思想光辉的新缅甸。
    于民生在讲话中强调说，我要向大家报告一个好消息：缅甸共产党领导的解放区已经开始组织了红卫兵。
    于民生在介绍缅甸人民革命武装斗争的发展时说，以德钦丹东同志为首的缅甸共产党，正在领导缅甸人民进行一场伟大的人民战争。从一九四八年以来，缅共一直高举人民革命战争的大旗，坚持着革命武装斗争，它所领导的人民武装，日益壮大起来。特别是最近一年多来，有了迅速的发展。目前，缅甸人民武装的战斗活动地区，已经扩展到缅甸的大部分国土。
    他说，缅甸的人民革命战争，沉重地打击了奈温反动政府的罪恶统治，打击了美帝和苏修。这是响彻在东南亚的又一曲人民战争的雄壮凯歌，是飘扬在亚洲大陆上的又一面马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的光辉红旗。
    于民生说，缅甸共产党坚信毛主席所指出的“枪杆子里面出政权”的伟大真理，“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切”的伟大真理，按照毛主席的建军思想，在缅甸建设一支新型的人民军队。缅甸人民武装以毛主席的军事思想作为自己的行动指南，把毛主席的著作作为主要的学习内容，把毛主席亲自制定的三大纪律八项注意作为每个指战员自觉遵守的纪律。他们在战斗中逐步熟练地掌握了毛主席关于人民战争的理论和一整套战略战术。
    缅甸共产党在战斗中，坚持依靠群众，建立农村根据地，并不断巩固和扩大根据地。缅甸共产党以长期斗争的历史，向全世界表明，人民战争有无限强大的生命力。它一定能够越战越强，并最后打倒奈温反动政府，争得缅甸人民的彻底解放。
    于民生的讲话受到全场热烈的鼓掌欢迎。
    出席今天记者招待会的，有被缅甸奈温反动政府指使暴徒打伤的我外交信使曹达林，在抗暴斗争中壮烈牺牲的我援缅专家刘逸烈士的家属刘亚芸，外交部新闻司司长秦加林，新华通讯社副社长王唯真等。招待会由中华全国新闻工作者协会第一书记吕彬主持。
