	Those who play with fire will perish by it
	Beijing Middle School Red Guards Representative Conference

	Mao Zedong's Red Guards, with blood flowing together, pulses beating together, fighting together, and winning together. We, the revolutionary faction of the Beijing middle school Red Guards Representative Conference, closely watch the struggles of our comrades in Wuhan. We stand shoulder to shoulder, heart to heart, fighting together to establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought throughout China and the world!

	Our great leader Mao Zedong teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat; they will make their last struggles."

	The handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the military in the Wuhan area are the agents of China's Khrushchev in Wuhan. For a long time, they have obstinately pursued the bourgeois reactionary line, fiercely opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They manipulate a handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes Army," cruelly suppressing and persecuting the proletarian revolutionary faction in Wuhan. Recently, they have even dared to direct their spears at our most beloved leader Chairman Mao and at the Central Cultural Revolution Group, which holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. This is a wanton provocation against the proletarian revolutionary factions across the nation. Facing such ferocious enemies as China's Khrushchev and his henchmen, how can we, the Red Guards of Chairman Mao, not be filled with boundless indignation?! We must smash them to smithereens and defend our red sun, Chairman Mao, with our blood and lives!

	The proletarian revolutionary faction in Wuhan is truly worthy of being Chairman Mao's good soldiers. Under the bourgeois dictatorship of a handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the military in the Wuhan area, amidst political storms more turbulent and treacherous than the Yangtze River, they use Mao Zedong Thought as their weapon, with hearts burning with loyalty, standing tall and firm, and have withstood severe tests! They are heroes who stand tall and firm, while those handful of class enemies are merely a few flies about to be frozen to death!

	"All reactionaries are paper tigers." The handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the military in the Wuhan area once seemed formidable and menacing, but they are merely paper tigers. In the face of the proletarian revolutionary faction's iron wall, they will eventually turn to dust. Those who play with fire will perish by it. Anyone who opposes Chairman Mao and anyone who goes against Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line will surely fail and perish!

	All the warriors of the Beijing middle school Red Guards Representative Conference swear to defend Chairman Mao and the Central Cultural Revolution Group with our blood and lives. We, the warriors of the Beijing middle school Red Guards Representative Conference, swear to be the strong backbone of the Wuhan proletarian revolutionary faction. Anyone who opposes Chairman Mao, anyone who opposes the Party Central Committee led by Chairman Mao, anyone who opposes the Central Cultural Revolution Group, we will resolutely overthrow them! We will make them collapse completely!

    玩火者必自焚
    首都中等学校红卫兵代表大会
    毛主席的红卫兵，热血流在一起，脉搏跳在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。我们首都中学红代会的无产阶级革命派，紧密地注视着武汉战友的斗争。我们肩并肩，心连心，共同为了在全中国、全世界树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威而战斗！
    伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”
    武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是中国的赫鲁晓夫在武汉的代理人，他们长期以来就顽固地推行资产阶级反动路线，疯狂反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，他们操纵“百万雄师”中的一小撮坏头头，疯狂镇压和迫害武汉的无产阶级革命派。最近，他们竟公然把矛头指向了我们最最敬爱的领袖毛主席，指向了高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的中央文革小组，这是对全国无产阶级革命派的猖狂挑衅。面对着中国的赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙这样疯狂凶恶的敌人，怎能不激起我们毛主席红卫兵的怒火万丈？！我们一定要把他们砸个稀巴烂，用鲜血和生命保卫我们心中的红太阳毛主席！
    武汉的无产阶级革命派不愧为毛主席的好战士，他们在武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的资产阶级专政下，在比长江还要汹涌险恶的政治风浪中，用毛泽东思想为武器，怀着一颗颗赤诚的红心，昂首挺胸，经受住了严峻的考验！他们是顶天立地的英雄好汉，而那一小撮阶级敌人只不过是几只就要被冻死的苍蝇！
    “一切反动派都是纸老虎”，武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，曾经一时气势汹汹，杀气腾腾，但他们只不过是纸老虎，在无产阶级革命派的铜墙铁壁面前，终将化为粪土。玩火者必自焚，凡是反对毛主席，凡是和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线作对的人，必定失败，必定灭亡！
    我们首都中学红代会的全体战士誓用鲜血和生命保卫毛主席，保卫中央文革小组。我们中学红代会的战士们誓做武汉无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾。谁反对毛主席，谁反对以毛主席为首的党中央，谁反对中央文革小组，我们就坚决打倒他！叫他彻底垮台！
