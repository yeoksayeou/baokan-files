The backstage boss has appeared.

The Ne Win reactionary government is madly engaging in anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, and the Soviet revisionist propaganda machine is screaming and cheering at full throttle. The Soviet revisionist clique is completely in cahoots with the Burmese reactionaries, going to great lengths to distort right and wrong.

The Soviet revisionist clique and the Burmese reactionaries are singing the same tune, slandering the Burmese Chinese students for wearing badges of the great leader Chairman Mao as "provocative behavior." It is no surprise that the Soviet revisionist renegades would say such things. You in the Soviet Union, just like Ne Win in Burma, are both practicing bourgeois dictatorship. You hate the brilliant Mao Zedong Thought to the core. In your eyes, anyone who reads Chairman Mao's books or wears his badges is a threat to your reactionary rule, an intolerable "provocation." Haven't you also accused Chinese students of "disrupting order" for reading the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" at Lenin's tomb in Moscow and then had the military police and secret agents beat them up? Your slanders only prove that you are as reactionary as Ne Win. The fascist anti-China tricks of the Ne Win reactionary government are exactly what you taught them.

The Soviet revisionist clique also slanders the Chinese people's protests against the Burmese reactionary government's fascist anti-China atrocities as "nationalist fervor." This is sheer nonsense! The Ne Win reactionary government is the one who orchestrated the bloody anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities, which are a blatant copy of Hitler's racism. It is under your orders and encouragement that they dare to act so recklessly. Haven't you been praising Ne Win's fascist regime's reactionary policies as "socialism" all along? You and American imperialism have been instigating the Ne Win reactionary government to be anti-China. Now, you are vigorously cheering for the rampantly anti-China Ne Win reactionary government, even spreading rumors that China intends to use the Chinese in Burma for "unknown purposes," deliberately helping the Ne Win reactionary government to further incite hostility between the peoples of China and Burma. This precisely proves that you renegades are not only instigators of nationalist fervor but also instigators of racial fervor!

Chairman Mao said, "When the representatives of various exploiting classes find themselves in an unfavorable situation, in order to protect their present existence and future development, they often adopt a strategy of attacking in order to defend themselves." Today, the great Mao Zedong Thought and the Chinese Cultural Revolution are spreading widely and deeply around the world, inspiring the revolutionary people of the world. Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries are therefore terrified. In order to preserve their common counter-revolutionary cause, U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism are inciting anti-China sentiment everywhere, and reactionaries in various countries are responding in unison. As soon as the Ne Win reactionary government started being anti-China, the Soviet revisionist clique immediately jumped out with U.S. imperialism, shouting in unison to support it. This further exposes that you and the U.S. are both the backstage bosses of this fascist butcher, Ne Win. However, the U.S. is the big boss, and you are the second boss. Now, you have only moved from the backstage to the front stage; the backstage boss has appeared.

However, the Ne Win reactionary government's mad anti-China activities will only backfire. The Soviet revisionist clique adding a fascist clique like Ne Win to be their anti-China lackey will not boost their morale much. The more you collude with U.S. imperialism and reactionary cliques like Ne Win, the more rampantly anti-China you become, the sooner your days of going to the grave will come.

　　后台老板出场了
    奈温反动政府疯狂反华排华，苏修的宣传机器竟然开足马力，呐喊助威。苏修集团完全同缅甸反动派一个鼻孔出气，极尽颠倒黑白的能事。
    苏修集团和缅甸反动派一个腔调，大肆诬蔑缅甸的华侨学生佩戴伟大领袖毛主席的像章是什么“挑衅行为”。苏修叛徒说出这种话来，毫不奇怪。你们在苏联同奈温在缅甸一样，都是实行资产阶级专政。你们对光焰无际的毛泽东思想恨之入骨。在你们看来，谁读毛主席的书，戴毛主席的像章，都是对你们的反动统治的威胁，都是不可容忍的“挑衅”。你们不是也曾经给在莫斯科列宁墓前朗读《毛主席语录》的中国留学生加上“扰乱秩序”的罪名，出动军警特务加以毒打吗？你们的诬蔑，只能证明你们是同奈温一样的反动家伙，奈温反动政府的那一套法西斯反华伎俩，正是从你们那里学来的。
    苏修集团还诽谤中国人民举行抗议缅甸反动政府法西斯反华暴行的示威是什么“民族主义狂热”。这简直是胡说八道！奈温反动政府一手制造反华排华的血腥暴行，是地地道道的希特勒种族主义的翻版。它正是在你们的指使和怂恿之下才胆敢这样胡作非为的。你们不是早就把奈温法西斯政权的反动政策吹捧为什么“社会主义”吗？你们和美帝国主义早就在策动奈温反动政府反华了。现在，你们又竭力给猖狂反华的奈温反动政府打气，甚至造谣说什么中国要把在缅甸的华侨“用于不可告人的目的”，蓄意帮助奈温反动政府进一步挑拨中缅两国人民之间的关系，这恰恰证明你们这些叛徒不仅是民族主义狂热的煽动者，而且是种族主义狂热的煽动者！
    毛主席说，“各种剥削阶级的代表人物，当着他们处在不利情况的时候，为了保护他们现在的生存，以利将来的发展，他们往往采取以攻为守的策略。”今天，伟大的毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响在全世界广泛传播，日益深入，使全世界革命人民斗志昂扬。帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派因此吓破了胆。为了保住他们反革命的共同事业，美帝苏修到处策动反华，各国反动派则纷起响应。奈温反动政府反华一开始，苏修集团就马上同美帝国主义一起跳了出来，异口同声地给它帮腔。这就更清楚地暴露了你们和美帝都是奈温这个法西斯刽子手的后台。不过美帝是大老板，你们是二老板。现在，你们只是从幕后走到了前台，后台老板出场了。
    但是，奈温反动政府疯狂反华，只能是搬起石头砸自己的脚。苏修增添一个奈温这样的法西斯集团来充当反华走卒，也助长不了多少声势。你们同美帝国主义和奈温集团之类的反动派勾结得越紧，反华越猖狂，你们进坟墓的日子也就将来得越快。
