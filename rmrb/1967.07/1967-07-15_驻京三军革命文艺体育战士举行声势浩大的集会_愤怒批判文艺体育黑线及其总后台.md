Revolutionary artists and athletes of the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces stationed in Beijing held a massive rally today to thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist black line in arts and sports. The revolutionary artists and athletes, holding high the banner of proletarian revolutionary criticism and armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, exposed facts and reasoned logically. They mercilessly exposed and criticized the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the arts community and those who had infiltrated the military arts community, as well as their mastermind, the top capitalist-roader within the Party. This rally fully demonstrated the powerful force of the great alliance of revolutionary artists and athletes from the land, sea, and air forces stationed in Beijing. It greatly boosted the morale of the proletarian revolutionaries and greatly dampened the arrogance of the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the arts community and their mastermind, the Khrushchev of China.

Responsible officials from the land, sea, and air forces stationed in Beijing and representatives from the Beijing Revolutionary Committee attended today's criticism meeting. Revolutionary representatives from the direct organs and academies of the three services in Beijing and from twenty-three revolutionary arts and sports organizations in the capital were invited to attend the meeting.

Revolutionary artists and athletes from the land, sea, and air forces stationed in Beijing angrily exposed and criticized the top capitalist-roader within the Party and the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists inside and outside the military who, under their protection and support, had been carrying out the counter-revolutionary revisionist line in arts and sports. The representatives, in their speeches, cited numerous facts to show that the handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists who had seized important positions in the arts community and their mastermind, the Khrushchev of China, had been viciously slandering and opposing the praise of Chairman Mao, the reddest red sun in the hearts of the Chinese people and the revolutionary people of the world. They had opposed the propagation of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the direction of serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers and serving proletarian politics as advocated by Chairman Mao. They had crazily advocated the "whole people's arts" theory, advocated bourgeois liberalization, and implemented the "three names, three highs" policy. They had attempted to turn the honorable revolutionary tradition of the military arts and sports teams into a tool for capitalist restoration and to corrupt our great army with the rotten goods of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism. These shocking class struggle facts aroused great indignation among the audience, who repeatedly shouted:

"Down with those who oppose Chairman Mao!"

"Down with those who oppose Mao Zedong Thought!"

"Long live the invincible proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!"

"Long live, ten thousand times long live, the great leader Chairman Mao!"

The representatives also unanimously expressed that they would definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, arm their minds with the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, and push the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to a new stage, achieving new levels of study and application. They would definitely carry forward the revolutionary spirit of "pursuing the enemy to the bitter end," firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, unite the broadest revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, achieve and consolidate the great alliance of revolution, further launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, give the enemy no chance to breathe, pursue and attack them relentlessly, and overthrow, smash, and expose the top capitalist-roader within the Party. They would definitely complete the tasks of struggle, criticism, and transformation in their units in a solid manner and achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

  “全民文艺”论，鼓吹资产阶级自由化，推行“三名三高”政策，妄图把具有光荣革命传统的部队文艺体育队伍演变成为资本主义复辟的工具，妄图用腐朽的封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的黑货腐蚀我们伟大的军队。这些触目惊心的阶级斗争的事实，激起了大家的无比愤怒，全场不断地振臂高呼：
  “谁反对毛主席就打倒谁！”“谁反对毛泽东思想就打倒谁！”“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
