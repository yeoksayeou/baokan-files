Our revolutionary faction in Yiyitang Production Brigade of Huangcun Commune, Daxing County, Beijing, and the masses who were deceived into joining the conservative faction, had a period of mutual opposition and attacks, which not only affected production but also hindered the struggle against the capitalist roaders within the Party.

How to solve this problem? We feel that the first step is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, raising the ideological and policy levels of the revolutionary faction.

The "Hongying" and "Hongxin Xiangdang" combat teams in our brigade have always had the correct direction in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. However, for a period, some comrades could not correctly handle the masses who joined the conservative faction, calling them "royalists," "die-hard reactionaries," and saying they wanted to "get some relief grain." Some even thought that to overthrow the capitalist roaders, one must first overthrow those who support them.

To address these erroneous thoughts within the revolutionary organization, with the help of the PLA comrades, we fought while rectifying our work style, seriously studying Chairman Mao's great works such as "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and carrying out criticism and self-criticism.

Through this rectification and study, we in the revolutionary faction first recognized the need to strictly distinguish between enemies and ourselves. We realized that the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party and the untransformed landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists are our main enemies, the focus of the cultural revolution in the countryside. The masses who joined the conservative faction are mostly our class brothers who suffered greatly before liberation but were deceived by the reactionary bourgeois line during the cultural revolution. Our contradictions with them are internal contradictions among the people, not antagonistic contradictions. In the conservative faction, there was a squad leader of the "Suicide Squad" who once declared that he would fight to the end with the revolutionary faction. Some comrades thought this person was beyond redemption, and the struggle with him was a life-and-death struggle. Through study, we analyzed his class background. His father, before liberation, was homeless and landless. After liberation, he lacked labor power and lived a hard life. He joined the conservative faction and became a key member mainly because he was economically lured by the capitalist roaders in the village and failed to see their evil deeds. Such an analysis changed our view of him, and we felt he was still our class brother. We revolutionary faction must firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, directing our attacks at the capitalist roaders within the Party, not at our deceived class brothers.

During the rectification process, we repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's teachings: "The proletariat not only wants to liberate itself but also wants to liberate all of humanity. If it cannot liberate all of humanity, the proletariat itself cannot ultimately be liberated." We realized that the fundamental reason why our revolutionary faction did not grow stronger in a few months was that we did not do thorough political and ideological work to unite and help the deceived masses. Chairman Mao taught us: "All issues of an ideological nature and all issues of internal contradictions among the people can only be resolved through democratic methods, through methods of discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education, and cannot be resolved through coercion and suppression." Comparing our actions with Chairman Mao's teachings, the masses and cadres in the revolutionary faction all examined their past mistakes. Some comrades said, "Singing 'royalist songs' at them was just to vent our anger, but it only made their resentment grow." Others said, "Going to their homes and shouting 'down with the royalists' was wrong." We all felt that such actions not only failed to unite the masses but also alienated them.

After the rectification and study, the masses' ideological and policy levels significantly improved. Everyone actively and voluntarily worked to unite and win over the deceived masses, repeatedly propagating Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to them, and voluntarily held meetings with the conservative faction's masses. We continuously held large meetings, combining our village's actual situation to expose and criticize the biggest capitalist roader within the Party, making the deceived masses clear that our common enemy is the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. At the same time, we mobilized the revolutionary faction's masses to do thorough political and ideological work with the deceived masses, actively having heart-to-heart talks and exchanging views.

Through a series of efforts, the masses in the revolutionary faction raised their ideological and policy levels, the masses who joined the conservative faction raised their class consciousness, and the atmosphere of opposition greatly eased. Previously, they worked separately, went to work and returned home separately, and did not greet each other when they met; now they actively come together, work together, and greet each other with smiles. Many deceived masses joined the revolutionary organization, and the revolutionary faction quickly grew stronger, gaining advantages in politics and organization, and bringing new vitality to production.

    要提高思想和政策水平
    北京市大兴县黄村公社一街大队　张德友　李金华　高振太
    我们一街生产大队革命派组织同受蒙蔽参加保守组织的群众，在一段时间内，互相对立，互相攻击，不仅影响了生产，而且影响了对党内走资本主义道路的当权派的斗争。
    怎样解决这个问题呢？我们感到，首先要活学活用毛主席著作，提高革命派组织的群众的思想和政策水平。
    我们大队的“红英”、“红心向党”等战斗队，在无产阶级文化大革命运动中，斗争的大方向始终是正确的。但在一段时间内，有些同志不能正确对待参加保守组织的群众，叫他们“保皇派”，“死顽固”，说他们想“捞点救济粮”。甚至认为，要斗倒走资本主义道路的当权派，先要斗倒“保”他的人。
    针对革命组织内部这种错误思想，在解放军同志的帮助下，我们边战斗，边整风，认真学习毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等伟大著作，开展了批评与自我批评。
    通过整风学习，在革命派组织的群众中，首先我们认识到必须严格分清敌我界限。大家认识到，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和没有改造好的地富反坏右分子，是我们贫下中农的主要敌人，是农村文化革命运动打击的重点。参加保守组织的群众，大多数人解放前苦大仇深，是我们的阶级弟兄。他们在文化革命运动中，一时站错了队，是受了资产阶级反动路线的蒙蔽。我们同他们的矛盾是人民内部矛盾，不是敌我矛盾。在保守组织中，有一个“敢死队”的队长，曾经扬言要和革命派组织干到底。有些同志就认为这个人是不可挽救了，同他的斗争，是你死我活的斗争。在学习中，我们对他进行了阶级分析。他父亲解放前，溜房根，串房檐，房无一间，地无一垄。解放后，劳力缺少，生活也不富裕。他参加保守组织，并且成为保守组织的骨干，主要是受了本村走资本主义道路当权派的经济拉拢，看不清这些人走资本主义道路的罪恶事实。这样一分析，大家对他的看法有了改变，感到他还是我们的阶级弟兄。我们革命派一定要牢牢掌握斗争的大方向，把斗争的矛头对准党内走资本主义道路的当权派，不能对准受蒙蔽的阶级弟兄。
    在整风的过程中，我们反复学习了毛主席关于“无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放”的教导。大家认识到：革命派组织在几个月时间内没有发展壮大，最根本的原因，就是我们没有很好做细致的政治思想工作，团结和帮助受蒙蔽的群众。毛主席教导我们：“凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。”对照毛主席的教导，革命派组织的群众和骨干，纷纷检查了过去的错误做法。有的同志说：“冲着人家唱‘保皇歌’就是为了出气，越唱对方意见越大。”有的同志说：“到人家家里去喊打倒保皇派，就是不对。”大家感到：过去的这种作法，不但不能团结群众，相反还脱离了群众。
    经过整风学习，群众的思想和政策水平显著提高了。大家积极主动做团结争取受蒙蔽的群众的工作，向他们反复宣传毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，并且主动和保守组织的群众一起，连续召开大会，结合本村实际情况，揭发和批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，使受蒙蔽群众明确了我们的共同敌人就是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。同时，我们还发动革命派群众，对受蒙蔽的群众开展深入细致的政治思想工作，主动谈心，交换意见。
    经过一系列的工作，革命派组织的群众提高了思想和政策水平，参加保守组织的群众提高了阶级觉悟，对立情绪大大缓和。过去干活分开干，上下工各走各的，见了面谁也不答理谁；现在主动走到一起，劳动在一起，见面也有说有笑了。很多受蒙蔽的群众参加了革命组织，革命派组织迅速发展壮大，在政治上、组织上都占了优势，在生产上也出现了新气象。
