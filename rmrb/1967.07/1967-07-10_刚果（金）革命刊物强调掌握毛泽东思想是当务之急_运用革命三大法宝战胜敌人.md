The Congolese (Kinshasa) Revolutionary Youth League's official publication, *Lightning* magazine, recently published an article stating that Congolese (Kinshasa) revolutionaries, in order to further mobilize and organize the broad masses of the people, must carry the armed struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to the end, achieve victory in the national democratic revolution, and must urgently grasp Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. They must also establish a Marxist-Leninist party and a broad anti-imperialist united front in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought.

The article states: "Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era in which imperialism is heading towards collapse and socialism is heading towards victory. The more we study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, the firmer our proletarian stand will be, the higher our ideological and political theoretical level will be, and the greater our ability to win the revolution will be."

The article quotes Chairman Mao: "A party that is disciplined, armed with Marxism-Leninism, practices self-criticism, and is linked with the masses. An army led by such a party. A united front of all revolutionary classes and revolutionary groups led by such a party. These three are our main weapons for defeating the enemy." The article points out that these three treasures are decisive weapons for the Congolese (Kinshasa) people to win the revolution.

The article continues: "Through several years of struggle, many Congolese (Kinshasa) revolutionaries have come to realize: We must establish a genuine revolutionary party that can combine the universal truths of Marxism-Leninism with the specific practice of our revolution. Only by establishing a new type of Marxist-Leninist party can we shoulder the great historical mission of eliminating imperialism and leading the people's war to victory."

In discussing the establishment of a broad anti-imperialist united front, the article states: "While we are striving to build a genuine revolutionary Marxist-Leninist vanguard party, we must also establish a truly broad anti-imperialist united front that includes all genuine nationalist and progressive social strata, all patriotic organizations, and all those who are steadfastly engaged in the anti-imperialist struggle, so as to win national independence."

The article states: The patriotic armed forces of the Congolese (Kinshasa) people, with the support and help of the masses, are continuing their unyielding struggle in various regions, striking a resolute blow against the U.S. imperialists and their puppet regime of Mobutu, and continuously expanding the guerrilla base areas. The article points out that the current task is to further mobilize and organize the people so as to fundamentally change the situation of the balance of forces between the enemy and us on a national scale. After emphasizing that U.S. imperialism is the number one enemy of the Congolese (Kinshasa) people, the article points out: "The revolutionary experience of the peoples of various countries in the world proves that, no matter how small a country may be, as long as its people are politically and ideologically mobilized, organized, and trained, and are guided by the correct line, they will definitely be able to resist and defeat any seemingly powerful enemy."

　　刚果（金）革命刊物强调掌握毛泽东思想是当务之急
　　运用革命三大法宝战胜敌人
    据新华社讯　刚果（金）革命青年联盟机关刊物《闪电》杂志最近发表一篇文章指出，刚果（金）革命者为了进一步动员和组织广大人民群众，把反对美帝国主义及其走狗统治的武装斗争进行到底，取得民族民主革命的胜利，当务之急是要真正地把马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想掌握起来，并遵循毛泽东思想建立一个马克思列宁主义的党和一个广泛的反帝统一战线。
    文章说：“毛泽东思想是帝国主义走向崩溃、社会主义走向胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。”“我们越学习和应用毛泽东思想，我们的无产阶级立场就越坚定，我们的思想水平和政治理论水平就越高，我们争取革命胜利的能力就越大。”
    文章引用了毛主席的一段话：“一个有纪律的，有马克思列宁主义的理论武装的，采取自我批评方法的，联系人民群众的党。一个由这样的党领导的军队。一个由这样的党领导的各革命阶级各革命派别的统一战线。这三件是我们战胜敌人的主要武器。”文章指出，毛主席指出的这三件法宝对刚果（金）人民争取革命胜利来说是决定性的武器。
    文章接着说，通过几年来的斗争，“现在，许多刚果（金）革命者认识到：必须建立一个善于把马克思列宁主义的普遍真理同我国革命具体实践相结合的真正的革命党。”“只有建立一个新型的马克思列宁主义的党，才能担负起消灭帝国主义和把人民战争引向胜利这个伟大的历史使命。”
    文章在谈到建立广泛的反帝统一战线时说：“我们在努力建设一个真正革命的马克思列宁主义的先锋政党的同时，应当建立一个包括所有的真正民族主义的和进步的社会阶层、一切爱国组织、所有坚定不移地进行反帝斗争的人的真正广泛的反帝统一战线，以便赢得民族独立。”
    文章说：刚果（金）爱国武装力量在人民群众的支持和帮助下，正在各个地区继续进行不屈不挠的斗争，给美帝及其走狗蒙博托傀儡政权以坚决的打击，并不断扩大游击根据地。文章指出，当前的问题是在于进一步动员和组织人民，以便在全国范围内彻底改变敌我之间力量对比的状况。文章在着重指出美帝国主义是刚果人民的头号敌人后指出：“世界各国人民的革命经验证明，一个国家的人民，不管这个国家多么小，只要人民在政治上和思想上动员起来、组织起来和受到训练，并在正确的路线指引下，那么就一定能够抗击和战胜任何貌似强大的敌人。”
