Inspired by the rapidly growing anti-British struggle, workers and people from all walks of life in Hong Kong and Kowloon took to the streets from morning to night on July 9, holding massive demonstrations. They pasted and wrote big-character posters and slogans everywhere to protest against the fascist atrocities of British imperialism in Hong Kong.

A contingent of over 700 workers, full of vigor and spirit, held a grand demonstration in the Red Ferry area of Kowloon at 4:30 PM on July 9. At the head of the march, workers held high portraits of Chairman Mao, quotations from Chairman Mao, and banners reading "Long Live the Invincible Thought of Mao Zedong!" The workers sang revolutionary songs like "The East is Red" and "The Boat Sails with the Helmsman" over and over again, shouting "Long Live Chairman Mao!" repeatedly.

The demonstration received enthusiastic cheers from the crowds along the route. The marchers also wrote anti-British slogans in red paint along the way, and passing vehicles stopped voluntarily. When the demonstration approached the gate of the Kowloon Dockyard, the British management was terrified and hastily closed the gate. The demonstrators then wrote big-character slogans on the gate and walls, shouting slogans like "We will definitely fight and defeat the British imperialists in Hong Kong!"

In the eastern district of Hong Kong, 500 brave workers held a demonstration on the streets of Shau Kei Wan on July 9. The marchers held high portraits of Chairman Mao, quotations from Chairman Mao, and large banners reading "Long Live the Great Leader Chairman Mao!" Each worker was full of spirit and fighting spirit. They waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and shouted slogans such as "Long Live the Communist Party of China!" "Long Live the Great Leader Chairman Mao!" "Persist in the strike and fight to the end!" "The British will be defeated, we will be victorious!" The passionate slogans and powerful revolutionary songs echoed through the sky.

Many people came out from shops and residences to the sides of the streets, cheering and applauding the workers. When the demonstration passed through the market, many vendors also applauded and saluted the workers.

Powerful anti-British big-character posters not only covered Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the New Territories, but also appeared on the sea. Recently, balloons flying in the sky over Hong Kong were written with "Down with the British Empire!" "We will be victorious, the British will be defeated!" Now, they have developed to the sea. On July 9, wooden buoys with the words "Blood for blood!" "Down with the British Empire!" "We will be victorious, the British will be defeated!" appeared on the sea off Kowloon.

The "Magistracy" in Kowloon's Kwun Tong, the "Immigration Department" in Sheung Shui, and the branches of the British-owned HSBC in Kwun Tong, So Uk Village, Mong Kok, and Sheung Shui all had large character slogans painted with oil paint on their buildings on July 9.

On the mountain opposite the Taikoo Dockyard in Hong Kong's Shau Kei Wan, the crowd also wrote large character slogans reading "Blood for blood!" "The British will be defeated!" On the morning of July 9, the crowd also wrote large character slogans on the walls of the Hong Kong Jockey Club, such as "The battle at Sha Tau Kok is excellent!" "Firmly support the united strike!"

    反英抗暴斗志昂扬　反英抗暴形势越来越好
    香港同胞继续大示威抗议英帝暴行
    新华社香港十日电　在反英抗暴队伍迅速壮大的大好形势的鼓舞下，港九工人和各界同胞，九日从早到晚，继续走上街头，举行了声势浩大的示威游行，到处张贴、书写反英抗暴大字报和大字标语，抗议港英帝国主义的法西斯暴行。
    一支由七百多人组成的雄赳赳、气昂昂的工人抗暴队伍，九日下午四时三十分在九龙红磡地区举行了盛大的示威游行。在浩浩荡荡的队伍前面，工人高举伟大领袖毛主席的画像、毛主席语录牌和写上“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”的横幅标语。工人们一遍又一遍地高唱《大海航行靠舵手》等革命歌曲，一次又一次地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”
    示威队伍沿途受到了街上群众的热烈欢呼。游行队伍还沿途用红漆书写抗暴标语，来往的车辆也自动停下来。当游行队伍向着九龙船坞的大门口进发时，英国厂方怕得要命，慌慌张张地关上厂门。示威工人就在厂门和围墙上，用红漆写上大字标语。高喊“一定把港英斗垮、斗臭！”等口号。
    香港东区的五百名英勇的工人，九日在筲箕湾的大街上也举行了示威游行。游行队伍高举毛主席像、语录牌和写着：“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”等巨幅标语。工人个个意气风发，斗志昂扬，他们挥动红彤彤的《毛主席语录》。“中国共产党万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”“坚持罢工、斗争到底！”“港英必败，我们必胜！”的激昂口号声和雄壮的革命歌声，响彻云霄。
    许多群众从商店、住宅内走到街道两旁，热烈向工人队伍鼓掌欢呼。当游行队伍经过菜市场时，很多小贩都向工人队伍鼓掌致敬。
    具有无比威力的反英抗暴大字报，不但贴遍了港九和新界地区，不久前飘扬在香港上空的反英抗暴气球上面写着：“打倒英帝！”，“我们必胜，港英必败！”，现在发展到海上。九日在九龙的海面上出现了写上“血债血偿！”“打倒英帝！”“我们必胜，港英必败！”的木制浮标。
    九龙观塘区的“裁判署”，上水的“移民局”以及英资汇丰银行的观塘、苏屋村、旺角、上水等地区分行的建筑物，九日都出现了大量用油漆书写的大字标语。
    在香港筲箕湾太古船坞对面的山上，也被群众写上了“血债血偿！”“港英必败！”的大字标语。九日晨，群众还在港英“马会”的墙壁上，写上了“沙头角杀敌好得很！”“坚决支持联合大罢工！”等大字标语。
