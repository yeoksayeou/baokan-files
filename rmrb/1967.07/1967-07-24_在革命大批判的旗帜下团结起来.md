In the new wave of revolutionary criticism, good news has come: the serious differences that had arisen between the Shanghai Workers' General Headquarters' Transportation System Liaison Station and the Shanghai Revolutionary Headquarters have been resolved. The two sides sat down, presented facts, spoke reason, conducted self-criticism, dispelled misunderstandings, removed antagonistic sentiments, and marched forward shoulder to shoulder to participate in the demonstration to denounce the number one capitalist-roader within the Party. This action of considering the overall situation, recognizing the big picture, and firmly grasping the direction of the struggle is truly excellent!

The Chinese Khrushchev is our sworn enemy. Thoroughly criticizing and thoroughly overthrowing this number one enemy, smashing his new counterattack, is the common combat mission of all revolutionary organizations and revolutionary masses, and is in the fundamental interests of all revolutionary people. No matter how great the differences are between revolutionary organizations, they should unite on this basis, unite, concentrate their firepower, and jointly fight the enemy. The reason why the Shanghai Revolutionary Headquarters and the Transportation System Liaison Station were able to quickly resolve their differences is precisely because they had such an understanding.

In the great revolutionary struggle, identifying the enemy and remembering the enemy is of paramount importance. Remembering the enemy means remembering the direction; forgetting the enemy means forgetting the direction, which will lead us astray and ruin our cause. This is especially true in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must firmly grasp the Chinese Khrushchev, this number one enemy, and criticize him so that his name stinks for eternity. This task is far from complete. The number one capitalist-roader within the Party is still alive, his heart is not dead, and he is still trying to restore his lost "paradise." There is an old Chinese saying, "A centipede, even when dead, does not straighten up." To thoroughly eliminate the influence of the number one capitalist-roader within the Party and his clique, and to sweep away these rubbish, we will still need a long time and great effort. Therefore, all revolutionary organizations must not set aside the main enemy and engage in principled disputes or principled "internal wars," but must unite all those who can be united, achieve the broadest possible unity with the leftists as the core, organize a mighty revolutionary army, and launch a new wave of revolutionary criticism to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

If we do not unite and combine forces under the banner of revolutionary criticism, that is exactly what the class enemy wants. The class enemy is always on the lookout for opportunities, seeking to exploit our weaknesses to create divisions within our ranks; they always use tricks to deal with the revolutionary forces, pulling people out of our ranks to expand their own forces and achieve their counter-revolutionary unity. If revolutionary organizations engage in principled "internal wars," using fists against their own class brothers, treating comrades as enemies, they are actually helping the enemy. If they insist on the interests of small groups, insist on splitting, refuse to listen to anyone, and refuse to accept any opinions, they may eventually end up in the camp opposing the proletarian headquarters. The forces of revolution and counter-revolution are either growing stronger while the other grows weaker, or growing weaker while the other grows stronger. In the fierce struggle between the two forces, if we allow the counter-revolutionary forces to regroup and unite, once the time is ripe, they will pounce on us, drowning the working people in a sea of blood. What a dangerous situation this is!

To concentrate our forces to fight the main enemy, if differences arise between revolutionary organizations, both sides must remain calm and handle the situation carefully. First, analyze the nature of the contradictions, and second, adopt correct methods of handling them. The differences between revolutionary organizations are all internal contradictions among the people, secondary contradictions. Both sides should have the spirit of self-criticism to help resolve differences and strengthen unity. If a problem arises, rushing headlong and exaggerating the nature of the contradictions, attacking each other, will be exploited by the enemy.

When differences arise between revolutionary organizations, all revolutionaries should start from what is beneficial to unity and combination, and promote the resolution of differences and joint struggle against the enemy. One should not rely on hearsay, or even believe in some rumors, without distinguishing right from wrong, and arbitrarily accuse one side or the other, making a simple problem complicated. We must know that after the proletarian revolutionaries seize power, the class enemies are afraid of chaos. They will always try to sow discord, create chaos, and fish in troubled waters. We must always be highly vigilant against this.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Only through the unity of the Communist Party can the unity of the whole class and the whole nation be achieved, and only through the unity of the whole class and the whole nation can the enemy be defeated and the tasks of the national and democratic revolution be completed."

We must achieve the broadest possible unity with the leftists as the core, promote the new wave of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize and overthrow the Chinese Khrushchev, and complete the great task of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

### 在革命大批判的旗帜下团结起来

    在革命大批判的旗帜下团结起来
    上海《解放日报》二十日社论
    在革命大批判的新高潮中，传来了一个好消息：全市人民所关心的工总司交运系统联络站同上体司之间一度发生的严重分歧，已经消除了。他们双方坐下来，摆事实，讲道理，各自进行自我批评，解除了误会，去掉了对立情绪，并肩前进，共同参加了声讨党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的示威游行。这种顾大局、识大体，牢牢掌握斗争大方向的行动，真是好极了！
    中国的赫鲁晓夫是我们不共戴天的头号敌人。彻底批臭、彻底打倒这个头号敌人，粉碎他的新反扑，是一切革命组织、革命群众的共同战斗任务，也是全体革命人民的根本利益所在。革命组织之间不管有多大的分歧，都应该在这个基础上联合起来，团结起来，集中火力，共同对敌。上体司和交运联络站之所以能够很快地消除分歧，正是因为有了这样的认识。
    在伟大的革命斗争当中，认清敌人，记住敌人，是头等重要的大事。记住了敌人，就记住了大方向；忘记了敌人，就忘记了大方向，就会走错路，就会败坏我们的事业。在无产阶级文化大革命中，尤其是这样。我们就是要狠狠揪住中国赫鲁晓夫这个头号敌人，把他批得个遗臭万年。现在，这个任务还远远没有完成。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派人还在，心不死，还在妄想恢复他们失去了的“天堂”。中国有句古话说，“百足之虫，死而不僵”，要彻底肃清党内头号走资本主义道路当权派及其一伙的流毒，扫除这些垃圾，还要我们花费很长的时间、很大的力气。因此，一切革命组织切不可以把主要的敌人放在一边，搞无原则的纠纷，打无原则的“内战”，而是必须团结一切可以团结的人，实现以左派为核心的最广泛的大联合，组织起浩浩荡荡的革命大军，掀起革命大批判的新高潮，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    我们如果不是在革命大批判的旗帜下团结起来，联合起来，那正是阶级敌人所需要的。阶级敌人总是时时刻刻在窥测方向，寻找时机，利用我们的弱点，在我们的队伍里制造分裂的；总是用纵横捭阖的手段对付革命队伍，从我们队伍里拉出人去，以便扩大他们的队伍，实现他们的反革命联合。革命组织之间打无原则的“内战”，用拳头来对付自己的阶级兄弟，把同志当作敌人，那就在实际上帮了敌人的忙。如果坚持小团体的利益，坚持分裂，什么人的话都不听，什么意见都不接受，发展下去，就有可能站到反对无产阶级司令部的队伍里去。革命和反革命的力量，不是此长彼消，就是此消彼长。在两种势力的激烈斗争当中，要是让反革命势力重新纠集起来，联合起来，一旦时机成熟，他们就会向我们猛扑过来，把劳动人民淹没在血泊之中。这是多么危险的情景啊！
    为了集中力量同主要敌人作斗争，革命组织之间如果产生了分歧，双方都一定要保持冷静，慎重处理。一要分析矛盾的性质，二要采取正确的处理方法。革命组织之间的分歧，都是人民内部矛盾，是次要的矛盾。双方都应该有自我批评的精神，以利于消除分歧，增强团结。如果出了一点问题，就莽莽撞撞，一味夸大矛盾的性质，相互攻击，就会被敌人所利用。
    革命组织之间产生了分歧，一切革命者都应该从有利于团结，有利于联合出发，促使他们消除分歧，共同对敌。决不能够单凭一些道听途说，甚至轻信某些谣言，不分是非，随便地指责这一方或那一方，而使得本来不难解决的问题复杂起来。要知道，无产阶级革命派掌权之后，阶级敌人是唯恐天下不乱的。他们总是要进行挑拨离间，制造混乱，以便混水摸鱼的。对此我们随时都要保持高度的警惕。
    毛主席教导我们：“只有经过共产党的团结，才能达到全阶级和全民族的团结，只有经过全阶级全民族的团结，才能战胜敌人，完成民族和民主革命的任务。”
    我们一定要实现以左派为核心的最广泛的大联合，推动革命大批判的新高潮，把中国赫鲁晓夫彻底批臭批倒，胜利完成无产阶级文化大革命的伟大任务！
