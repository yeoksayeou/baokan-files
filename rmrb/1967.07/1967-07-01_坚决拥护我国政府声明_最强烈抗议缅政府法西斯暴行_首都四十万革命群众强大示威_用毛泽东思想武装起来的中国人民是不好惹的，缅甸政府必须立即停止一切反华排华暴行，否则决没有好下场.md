The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with. The Burmese government must immediately stop all anti-Chinese and discriminatory actions, otherwise it will face a dire outcome.

	New China News Agency, June 30th: Today, 400,000 revolutionary masses in the capital gathered in front of the Burmese Embassy in Beijing to hold a grand demonstration, strongly protesting the fascist atrocities and anti-Chinese discrimination by the Burmese government. They expressed their resolute support for the statement issued by our government on the 29th and their firm support for the heroic struggle of our personnel and overseas Chinese in Burma.

	From morning to night, revolutionary workers, cadres, teachers and students, Red Guards, and commune members from the suburbs, carried red flags, portraits of our great leader Chairman Mao, and copies of the "Little Red Book," marching towards the Burmese Embassy in Beijing. They angrily pointed out: The Burmese reactionary government incited thugs to kill and injure our experts and diplomatic personnel in Burma, and massacred a large number of patriotic overseas Chinese. This is an unprecedented bloody crime in international relations! This is a complete exposure of the fascist counter-revolutionary face of the Burmese government, and this blood debt must be repaid!

	The demonstrators pasted big-character posters and large banners on the walls and streets outside the Burmese Embassy. They angrily shouted, "Strongly protest the fascist atrocities of the Burmese government!" "The Burmese reactionaries will face a dire outcome for their anti-Chinese actions!"

	Revolutionary workers from the industrial, transportation, urban construction, and financial sectors of Beijing came out from their workshops, counters, and driver's seats, forming a vast procession to the Burmese Embassy. Workers from the Huabei Metal Structure Factory said: The Burmese government's creation of fascist atrocities is an attempt to destroy the deep friendship between the peoples of China and Burma built over many years, which we absolutely cannot tolerate! We resolutely support our government's solemn statement. The Burmese government must immediately stop all anti-Chinese and discriminatory actions and meet our government's solemn demands. Revolutionary workers from the Fengtai Locomotive Depot of the Beijing Railway Bureau wrote in a letter of protest to the Burmese Embassy: The Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are not to be trifled with. Your anti-Chinese actions will only result in your own defeat!

	Members of the Zhong-A Friendship People's Commune, who were busy with the summer agricultural work, rushed to protest against the Burmese government after finishing their work. They wrote in their letter of protest: A small group of reactionaries in Burma dare to oppose the seven hundred million Chinese people and revolutionary people around the world, which is truly audacious and foolish! You have joined the anti-Chinese chorus of imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries, but you are only a few flies making a few miserable noises. The blood debt you owe to the Chinese people, we will definitely settle.

	Many revolutionary teachers, students, and Red Guards from various schools in the capital participated in the demonstration with great indignation. They sternly warned the Burmese government to stop immediately all anti-Chinese and discriminatory actions and meet the solemn demands of our government. If you insist on your ways and go to the end, you will only end up hurting yourselves, and there will be no good outcome. This afternoon, three Red Guards, representing the revolutionary masses of all sectors in the capital, handed over a large number of protest letters to two staff members of the Burmese Embassy, demanding that the Burmese Embassy hand over these protest letters to the Burmese government. They shouted on the spot, "Strongly protest the fascist atrocities of the Burmese government!"

	A group of Chinese experts who had returned from Burma came to the Burmese Embassy with great indignation, strongly protesting the fascist atrocities of the Burmese government in inciting thugs to attack our embassy, kill our experts, and persecute our overseas Chinese. They warned the Burmese reactionaries: The friendship between the peoples of China and Burma cannot be destroyed. During our support for the construction of the Mitthar Textile Factory in Burma, we established deep class feelings with the Burmese laboring people. Many Burmese workers love Chairman Mao and admire Mao Zedong Thought. When we completed our construction tasks and returned to China, many Burmese workers enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Wish Chairman Mao a long life!" Now the Burmese reactionaries have instigated this anti-Chinese incident, which is completely against the will of the Burmese people. If you do not immediately stop these fascist atrocities, the peoples of China and Burma will never forgive you!

　　坚决拥护我国政府声明  最强烈抗议缅政府法西斯暴行
　　首都四十万革命群众强大示威
　　用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不好惹的，缅甸政府必须立即停止一切反华排华暴行，否则决没有好下场
    新华社三十日讯　首都今天又有四十万革命群众到缅甸驻华使馆门前，举行声势浩大的示威，最强烈抗议缅甸政府反华排华的法西斯暴行。他们表示坚决拥护我国政府二十九日声明，坚决支持我驻缅人员和侨胞的英勇斗争。
    从清晨到夜晚，参加示威的革命工人、革命干部、革命师生、红卫兵小将和郊区人民公社社员，高举红旗，抬着伟大领袖毛主席的画像，捧着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，浩浩荡荡走向缅甸驻华大使馆。他们愤怒地指出：缅甸反动政府唆使暴徒打死打伤我援缅专家和外交人员，屠杀大批爱国华侨，这是国际关系史上骇人听闻的血腥罪行！这是缅甸政府法西斯反革命面目的大暴露，这笔血债必须偿还！
    示威的群众，把一张张大字报和巨幅标语，贴在缅甸使馆外面的墙上和马路上。他们愤怒地高呼：“强烈抗议缅甸政府法西斯暴行！”“缅甸反动派反华决没有好下场！”
    北京市工业、交通、城市建设、财贸战线上的革命职工，纷纷从车间、柜台、驾驶室走出来，汇成浩浩荡荡的游行示威大军，愤怒地来到缅甸驻华大使馆门前。华北金属结构厂的工人们说：缅甸政府制造法西斯暴行，妄图破坏中缅两国人民多年来结下的深厚友谊，我们绝对不能容忍！我们坚决拥护我国政府的严正声明，缅甸政府必须立即停止一切反华排华暴行，立即实现我国的严正要求。北京铁路局丰台机务段革命职工在给缅甸驻华使馆的抗议信上指出，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民是不好惹的，你们反华排华，必将碰得头破血流！
    正在紧张忙着“三夏”农活的中阿友好人民公社的社员们，收工后立即赶来向缅甸政府抗议。他们在抗议书中说，缅甸一小撮反动派，竟敢与七亿中国人民和全世界革命人民为敌，真是胆大包天，不自量力！你们挤进帝、修、反反华大合唱的队伍里，也不过是几个苍蝇的几声凄厉而已。你们欠下中国人民的这笔血债，我们一定要清算。
    首都许多大中学校的革命师生和红卫兵小将们，以万分愤怒的心情参加示威游行。他们严正警告缅甸政府，必须悬崖勒马，立即停止一切反华排华暴行，立即实现我国政府的严正要求。如果你们一意孤行，蛮干到底，到头来，只能是搬起石头打自己的脚，决不会有好下场。今天下午，三位红卫兵小将代表首都各界无产阶级革命派，向两名缅甸驻华使馆人员递交了一大批抗议信，义正词严地要求缅甸驻华使馆，必须把这些抗议信转交缅甸政府。他们当场挥拳高呼：“强烈抗议缅甸政府的法西斯暴行！”
    我一批援缅回国人员，怀着无比愤怒的心情来到缅甸驻华大使馆门前，最强烈地抗议缅甸政府唆使暴徒袭击我使馆、杀害我援缅专家、迫害我侨胞的法西斯暴行。他们警告缅甸反动派：中缅两国人民的友谊是破坏不了的。我们在支援缅甸密铁拉纺织厂施工过程中，同缅甸劳动人民建立了深厚的阶级感情，许多缅甸工人无限热爱毛主席，无限崇拜毛泽东思想，当我们完成建厂任务回国时，很多缅甸工人热情地高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“祝毛主席万寿无疆！”现在缅甸反动派挑起这次反华排华事件，是完全违反缅甸人民意愿的。你们如不立即停止这种法西斯暴行，中缅两国人民绝对饶不了你们！
