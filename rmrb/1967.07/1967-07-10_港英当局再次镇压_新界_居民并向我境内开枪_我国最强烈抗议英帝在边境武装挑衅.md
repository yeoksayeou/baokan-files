The British authorities in Hong Kong once again suppressed residents of the "New Territories" and opened fire into our territory.

Our country lodges the strongest protest against British imperialism's armed provocation at the border.

New China News Agency, July 9th: Today, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Luo Guibo summoned the British Chargé d'Affaires Hopkins to hand over a note from the Chinese Foreign Ministry. The note strongly protests the British authorities in Hong Kong for their bloody violence on July 8th in Sha Tau Kok, where they shot and killed one protester, injured eight, and carried out serious armed provocation against the Chinese people. The note is as follows:

British Chargé d'Affaires Office:

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China requests that the British Chargé d'Affaires Office immediately convey the following to the British Government.

On July 8th, residents on our side of the border in Sha Tau Kok and Chinese residents of the "New Territories" in Kowloon held a rally to support the patriotic struggle of compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon against the brutal persecution by the British authorities in Hong Kong. After the rally, they split into groups to hold protest marches. Fully armed Hong Kong British police and "riot control units" deliberately carried out a bloody suppression, releasing tear gas and opening fire on the protesting Chinese residents returning to the "New Territories" in Kowloon. They also opened fire into our territory. Our border guards immediately fired warning shots in response. However, the Hong Kong British police and "riot control units" completely ignored our warnings and continued to open fire on the protesting crowd, resulting in one death and eight injuries. Our border guards also retaliated against the Hong Kong British police and "riot control units."

Following the suppression of protesters in Sha Tau Kok on June 24th, where several were injured and arrested, and tear gas was released into our territory, causing more than thirty of our residents to be injured, the British authorities in Hong Kong have now carried out another bloody suppression in Sha Tau Kok, committing serious armed provocation against the Chinese people. The Chinese Government lodges the most urgent and strongest protest with the British Government and makes the following demands:

1. A public apology for the armed provocation incident in Sha Tau Kok on July 8th;
2. Immediate punishment of the culprits, compensation for all losses suffered by the residents and the injured in Sha Tau Kok, and the release of all residents arrested in Sha Tau Kok since June 24th;
3. A guarantee that similar incidents will not occur in the future.

Over the past two months, the British Government and the British authorities in Hong Kong, despite repeated warnings from the Chinese Government, have escalated their fascist suppression of the residents of Hong Kong. Now, the British Government and the British authorities in Hong Kong have created a tense situation at the border, making the situation in Hong Kong increasingly serious. The Chinese Government solemnly warns the British Government that if you insist on making enemies of the Chinese people, you must bear all the serious consequences that follow.

　　港英当局再次镇压“新界”居民并向我境内开枪
　　我国最强烈抗议英帝在边境武装挑衅
    新华社九日讯　我国外交部副部长罗贵波今日上午召见英国驻华代办霍普森，面交我国外交部照会，就香港英国当局八日在沙头角又一次制造血腥暴行，开枪打死示威群众一人、打伤八人、对中国人民进行严重的武装挑衅，向英国政府提出最紧急、最强烈的抗议。照会如下：英国驻华代办处：
    中华人民共和国外交部要求英国代办处立即把下列事项转告英国政府。
    七月八日，沙头角我方群众和九龙“新界”中国居民，为声援港九爱国同胞反对香港英国当局残酷迫害的正义斗争，在我方境内举行集会，会后分道举行示威游行。全副武装的港英警察和“防暴队”竟然对游行返回九龙“新界”的中国居民，进行蓄谋的血腥镇压，施放催泪弹和开枪射击；同时，还向我方境内开枪。对于英方的这种暴行和挑衅，我边防哨兵当即鸣枪警告。但是，港英警察和“防暴队”完全不顾我方的警告，继续向游行示威群众开枪射击，一人死亡，八人受伤。我边防哨兵对港英警察和“防暴队”亦进行了还击。
    香港英国当局继六月二十四日在沙头角镇压游行示威群众，打伤和逮捕十几人，并且将催泪弹施放到我方境内，使我方群众三十多人受伤之后，现在又一次在沙头角制造上述血腥暴行，对中国人民进行了严重的武装挑衅。中国政府向英国政府提出最紧急、最强烈的抗议，并且向英国政府提出下列要求：
    一、对七月八日沙头角武装挑衅事件公开道歉；
    二、立即惩办肇事凶手，赔偿沙头角居民和死伤人员所受到的一切损失，释放六月二十四日以来沙头角地方所有被捕居民；
    三、保证以后不再发生类似事件。
    两个月来，英国政府和香港英国当局不顾中国政府的一再警告，变本加厉地对中国香港居民实行法西斯镇压。现在，英国政府和香港英国当局又在边境上造成紧张局势。这就使得香港局势越来越严重。中国政府严正警告英国政府，如果你们硬要同中国人民为敌到底，你们就必须承担由此而引起的一切严重后果。
