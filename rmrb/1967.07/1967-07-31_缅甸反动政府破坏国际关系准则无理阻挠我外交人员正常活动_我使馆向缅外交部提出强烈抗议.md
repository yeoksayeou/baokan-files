Rangoon, July 30 (New China News Agency) — The reactionary government of Burma, led by Ne Win, has further flagrantly violated international norms, infringed upon the diplomatic privileges of the Chinese Embassy, and restricted its normal activities. On July 29, they brazenly created a serious incident by obstructing Chinese Embassy personnel from delivering a diplomatic note to the Burmese Foreign Ministry. The Chinese Embassy has strongly protested to the Burmese Foreign Ministry.

Since June 28, when the Ne Win reactionary government dispatched large numbers of military and police to surround and blockade the Chinese Embassy, the normal diplomatic activities of the Chinese Embassy and its personnel have been subjected to brutal obstruction, interference, and restrictions by Burmese military and police. Currently, the area where the Chinese Embassy is located is still designated as a "military-controlled zone." Four of the roads surrounding the embassy have been sealed off with barbed wire by the Burmese reactionary government, and the remaining single exit is fortified with eight barbed wire barriers, guarded by the military and police cars.

On the morning of July 29, Chinese Embassy diplomatic personnel went to the Burmese Foreign Ministry to deliver a diplomatic note. When the car reached the eighth roadblock, a police car blocked the exit. A Burmese officer, citing the lack of "permission" for the Chinese Embassy personnel to leave, ordered them to return immediately. He also arrogantly demanded that the Chinese diplomats contact the Burmese Foreign Ministry before exiting the sole passage from the Chinese Embassy for so-called "arrangements." A Chinese Embassy diplomat immediately lodged a strong protest on the spot.

The Chinese Embassy personnel going to the Burmese Foreign Ministry office is a normal diplomatic activity, which has never required prior notification to the Burmese Foreign Ministry. Now, the Ne Win reactionary government has added this new restriction, which is another escalation in its efforts to blockade the Chinese Embassy and blatantly violate international conventions.

On July 29, the Chinese Embassy strongly protested to the Burmese Foreign Ministry over this serious incident, condemning the Ne Win reactionary government for its arbitrary violation of international norms and the diplomatic privileges of the Chinese Embassy. It also solemnly pointed out that this is another serious step by the Burmese reactionary government to obstruct the normal work of Chinese diplomatic personnel, demanding that the Burmese reactionary government immediately stop its savage and unreasonable actions.

    缅甸反动政府破坏国际关系准则无理阻挠我外交人员正常活动
    我使馆向缅外交部提出强烈抗议
    新华社三十日讯　仰光消息：缅甸奈温反动政府恣意进一步破坏国际关系准则，侵犯中国大使馆外交特权和限制中国大使馆的正常活动，在二十九日竟然横蛮地制造了一起阻挠中国大使馆人员到缅甸外交部送交外交照会的严重事件。中国大使馆为此向缅甸外交部提出强烈抗议。
    奈温反动政府自从六月二十八日派出大批军警包围封锁中国大使馆以后，中国大使馆和使馆人员的正常外交活动一直受到缅甸军警的粗暴阻挠、干涉和限制。目前，中国大使馆所在的地区仍然被作为“军事管制区”，大使馆周围的四个路口，都被缅甸反动政府用铁丝网封锁，剩下的唯一出口也设置了八道铁丝网路障，并且由军队和警车严加防守。
    二十九日上午，中国大使馆外交人员前往缅甸外交部送交外交照会。当汽车开进第八道路障时，一辆警车堵住了出口。一个缅甸军官借口他们没有得到“允许”中国大使馆人员外出的命令，要中国大使馆人员立即回去。他还蛮横地要中国外交人员在走出中国大使馆的唯一通道之前同缅甸外交部接触，以便进行所谓“安排”。中国大使馆的一位外交人员当场严正地向他提出强烈抗议。
    中国大使馆人员到缅甸外交部办公处，这是大使馆的正常外交活动，从来没有事先通知过缅甸外交部。现在奈温反动政府又作出这一新的限制，是它在加紧封锁中国大使馆、粗暴地违反国际惯例方面的又一次升级。
    中国大使馆二十九日就这一严重事件向缅甸外交部提出强烈抗议，谴责奈温反动政府恣意破坏国际关系准则和中国大使馆的外交特权；并且郑重指出，这是缅甸反动政府企图阻挠中国外交人员进行正常工作的又一严重步骤，要求缅甸反动政府立即停止其野蛮无理的行动。
