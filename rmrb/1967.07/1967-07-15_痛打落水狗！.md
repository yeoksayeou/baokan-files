The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee has issued a battle cry to the revolutionary people of the entire city: immediately take action to further launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, and struggle to thoroughly smash the counter-revolutionary revisionist line implemented by the former Beijing Municipal Committee led by Peng Zhen! This is the guiding principle for all work in Beijing at present and the top priority in the political life of the revolutionary people of the entire city.

Chairman Mao says: "Those who have infiltrated the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles as representatives of the bourgeoisie are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will seize power and turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, who have been exposed by hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, are the general representatives of this bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. The counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee led by Peng Zhen is the vanguard of their conspiracy to usurp the Party, the army, and the government.

Beijing is the capital of the great seven hundred million Chinese people and the location of the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao. Under the support and protection of the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee led by Peng Zhen has turned Beijing into an "independent kingdom" where "not even a needle can be inserted or water splashed," attempting to turn it into a base for capitalist restoration in our country. Therefore, thoroughly smashing the rule of the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee led by Peng Zhen is to smash the "bridgehead" of the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in restoring capitalism in China; the criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line implemented by the former Beijing Municipal Committee led by Peng Zhen is a direct criticism of the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Currently, to carry out this great criticism and struggle more broadly and deeply is to defend Chairman Mao, to defend the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, to defend the proletarian headquarters led by Chairman Mao, and to defend the dictatorship of the proletariat. This is a major issue concerning the future and destiny of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution.

Chairman Mao says: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; it can be waged only by mobilizing the masses and relying on them." "Organizing tens of millions of people and mobilizing a vast revolutionary army is the need of today's revolution to attack counter-revolution." The great criticism and struggle is to mobilize the masses most thoroughly and deeply, to organize the masses, to achieve the broadest revolutionary unity with the leftists as the core, to firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, to concentrate the sharp edge of the struggle on the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique led by Peng Zhen and their ultimate backer—the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and to closely combine the great criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform within the unit, fighting a true people's war.

The great criticism and struggle against the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique led by Peng Zhen, and the deepening of the struggle, criticism, and reform within the unit, are extremely arduous and complex political tasks. To complete this task, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, conduct thorough investigations and research, think seriously about problems, and combine revolutionary enthusiasm with scientific spirit. Only in this way can we criticize, expose, and overthrow the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee led by Peng Zhen and the counter-revolutionary revisionist line they implemented, thoroughly eliminating all their poison in various fields.

The essence of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought is criticism and revolution. Chairman Mao says: "Without destruction, there can be no construction. Destruction is criticism and revolution. Destruction must be based on reason, and reason is construction. Destruction comes first, and construction is within it." The great criticism and struggle is to thoroughly criticize and overthrow the counter-revolutionary revisionist line and to establish Mao Zedong Thought. The new high tide of great criticism and struggle is the new high tide of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively. We should regard the great criticism and struggle as a large classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively.

Our era is a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as the great banner. The revolutionary people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are creating their new history with their revolutionary heroism. We firmly believe that the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses will carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of "beating the fallen dogs to death," pursuing and attacking relentlessly, and thoroughly burying the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the counter-revolutionary revisionist clique of the former Beijing Municipal Committee led by Peng Zhen, thoroughly smashing the counter-revolutionary revisionist line they implemented. In the process of thoroughly criticizing the old world, we will build a brilliant new world! (July 14)

    痛打落水狗！
    北京市革命委员会向全市革命人民发出了战斗号召：立即行动起来，进一步掀起革命大批判的新高潮，为彻底摧毁以彭真为首的旧北京市委所推行的反革命修正主义路线而斗争！这是当前北京市一切工作的纲，是全市革命人民政治生活中的头等大事。
    毛主席说：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，被亿万革命人民揪出来的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就是这一批反革命修正主义分子的总代表。以彭真为首的旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团，就是他们阴谋篡党、篡军、篡政的急先锋。
    北京，是伟大七亿中国人民的首都，是以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部的所在地。以彭真为首的旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团，在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的支持、包庇下，把北京市搞成“针插不进、水泼不进”的独立王国，妄图把它变成在我国实行资本主义复辟的一个基地。因此，彻底摧毁以彭真为首的旧北京市委的反革命修正主义集团的统治，就是摧毁党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在中国复辟资本主义的“桥头堡”；对以彭真为首的旧北京市委推行的反革命修正主义路线的批判，就是直接对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的批判。
    当前更广泛更深入地开展这场大批判、大斗争，就是保卫毛主席、保卫以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线、保卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部、保卫无产阶级专政的斗争。这是关系到中国革命和世界革命的前途和命运的大事。
    毛主席说：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军，是今天的革命向反革命进攻的需要。”革命的大批判、大斗争，就是要最充分、最深入地发动群众，组织群众，实现以左派为核心的最广泛的革命大联合，紧紧把握斗争大方向，把斗争的锋芒集中指向彭真反革命修正主义集团及其总后台——党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把革命的大批判同本单位的斗批改紧密地结合起来，打一场真正的人民战争。
    对彭真反革命修正主义集团的大批判、大斗争，深入进行本单位的斗批改，是极其艰巨复杂的政治任务。要完成这个任务，必须活学活用毛主席著作，深入地进行调查研究，认真地思考问题，把革命热情同科学精神结合起来。只有这样，才能把以彭真为首的旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团和它所推行的反革命修正主义路线批深、批透、批倒、批臭，彻底肃清它在各个领域里的一切流毒。
    马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的本质是批判的、革命的。毛主席说：“不破不立。破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”革命的大批判、大斗争，就是大破反革命修正主义路线，大立毛泽东思想。大批判、大斗争的新高潮，就是活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动的新高潮。我们要把革命的大批判、大斗争当作活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂。
    我们的时代，是以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。以毛泽东思想武装起来的革命人民用自己的革命英雄主义正在创造自己的新历史。我们坚信，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众，必将发扬“痛打落水狗”的彻底革命精神，穷追猛打，彻底埋葬党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和以彭真为首的旧北京市委反革命修正主义集团，彻底摧毁他们所推行的反革命修正主义路线，在彻底批判旧世界的过程中，建立一个光辉灿烂的新世界！（七月十四日）
