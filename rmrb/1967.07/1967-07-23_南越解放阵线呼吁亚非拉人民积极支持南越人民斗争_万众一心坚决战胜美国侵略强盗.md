The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam calls on Asian, African, and Latin American peoples to actively support the struggle of the South Vietnamese people
United as one, resolutely defeat the American aggressors

HANOI, July 21 (Xinhua) -- According to a report by the Liberation Radio of South Vietnam, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam issued a call on July 19, strongly condemning the barbaric aggression of U.S. imperialism against the Vietnamese people, and reaffirming the determination of the South Vietnamese people to unite as one and resolutely defeat the American aggressors.

The call states that based on the rich experience accumulated in years of struggle, the South Vietnamese people deeply understand that to regain independence and freedom, there is no other way but to stand up and save their country and themselves. Therefore, our people are united as one, with heightened hatred towards the enemy and strong patriotic spirit, determined to fight on until they thoroughly defeat the American aggressors, no matter how great the sacrifices and hardships.

The call points out that under the wise leadership of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam, the patriotic war of the South Vietnamese people is developing day by day, achieving one great victory after another. Recently, the military and civilian people of South Vietnam have continuously dealt heavy blows to the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys, causing them to suffer one defeat after another, pushing them into an even more difficult situation. Now, the balance of power in South Vietnam is more favorable to the anti-American, national salvation war of the South Vietnamese people than at any other time in the past.

The call points out that although the U.S. imperialists have suffered extremely serious defeats in all aspects, they are still stubborn and unwilling to give up their aggressive plots. U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara recently went to Saigon again to hatch new conspiracies. The U.S. is also sending more troops to South Vietnam to further expand the war of aggression against Vietnam, thereby endangering the peace and security of all countries in the world.

The call states that to counter the plot of the U.S. imperialists and their lackeys to expand the war of aggression to other Indochinese countries, the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the people will unite more closely with the Royal Government of Cambodia and the Khmer people, with the Lao people and the Lao Patriotic Front, strengthen mutual support, and fight to the end with the U.S. aggressors.

The call appeals to the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to further intensify their struggles, expose the aggressive and warlike nature of the U.S. imperialists, condemn their peace deception, and more actively support the anti-American, national salvation struggle of the South Vietnamese people.

The call finally emphasizes that at present, U.S. imperialism, in a serious predicament and at a loss, is desperately seeking a way out to reverse the defeats it has suffered in both South and North Vietnam. The National Liberation Front of South Vietnam and the South Vietnamese people solemnly declare once again that they are determined to persist in the struggle, no matter how great the sacrifices and difficulties, and no matter what the situation, they will fight to the end and achieve a thorough victory over U.S. imperialism.

    南越解放阵线呼吁亚非拉人民积极支持南越人民斗争
    万众一心坚决战胜美国侵略强盗
    新华社河内二十一日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道：越南南方民族解放阵线十九日发表呼吁书，强烈谴责美帝国主义对越南人民进行的野蛮侵略，重申越南南方人民万众一心、坚决战胜美国侵略强盗的决心。
    呼吁书说，越南南方人民根据他们在多年的斗争中积累起来的丰富经验，深深认识到，要重新取得独立和自由，除了坚决起来拯救他们的祖国和自己以外别无其他办法。因此，我们的人民万众一心，增强对敌人的刻骨仇恨和强烈的爱国主义精神，要坚决打下去，直到彻底战胜美国侵略者，不管有多大的牺牲和艰难困苦。
    呼吁书指出，在越南南方民族解放阵线的英明领导下，越南南方人民的爱国战争日益发展，一再取得巨大的胜利。近来，越南南方军民接连给予美帝国主义者及其走狗们以猛烈打击，使他们遭到一个接一个的挫败，使他们陷于更加困难的处境。现在，越南南方的力量对比比过去任何时候都更加有利于越南南方人民的抗美救国战争。
    呼吁书指出，美帝国主义者虽然已在各方面遭到非常严重的失败，但是仍然执迷不悟，不肯放弃他们的侵略阴谋。美国国防部长麦克纳马拉最近再次到西贡去策划新的阴谋。美国还向南越增派军队，以进一步扩大侵略越南的战争，从而危及世界各国的和平与安全。
    呼吁书说，为了应付美帝国主义者及其走狗要把侵略战争扩大到其他印度支那国家的阴谋，越南南方民族解放阵线和人民将同柬埔寨王国政府和高棉人民、同老挝人民和老挝爱国战线党更加紧密地团结在一起，加强互相支持，同美帝国主义侵略者坚决打到底。
    呼吁书呼吁亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民更加大力地展开斗争，揭露美帝国主义者的侵略和好战的本性，谴责他们的和平骗局，更加积极地支持越南南方人民的抗美救国斗争。
    呼吁书最后强调说，目前，美帝国主义在严重的困境和束手无策的情况下，正在竭力寻找出路，以挽回他们在越南南北两方所遭到的挫败。越南南方民族解放阵线和越南南方人民再次庄严宣布，他们决心坚持进行斗争，不管要忍受多大的牺牲和困难，不管在什么情况下，他们也决心打到底，打败美帝取得彻底的胜利。
