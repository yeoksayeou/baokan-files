The Ne Win reactionary government, following the dictates of the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists, has been frantically committing fascist atrocities of anti-China and anti-Chinese discrimination. After that, the Soviet revisionist leadership immediately stepped out from behind the scenes to the forefront, mobilizing all their propaganda machines to shout slogans and cheer for the Burmese reactionaries.

The Burmese reactionary government's current anti-China and anti-Chinese actions are part of the anti-China wave planned and orchestrated by the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionists. It is the inevitable result of the Ne Win clique's policy of dictatorship, betrayal, anti-communism, and anti-people. However, the Soviet revisionist mouthpiece Tass on June 28th absurdly claimed that this incident was instigated by "Chinese students."

It is only natural and a sacred right for patriotic overseas Chinese to love the great leader Chairman Mao, study the works of Chairman Mao, and wear Mao badges. However, the Soviet revisionist "Pravda" on July 1st published an anti-China article, slandering the wearing of Mao badges by overseas Chinese in Burma as "provocative behavior."

The Soviet revisionists are madly praising the fascist atrocities of the Ne Win reactionary clique in brutally beating, arresting, and massacring overseas Chinese, while viciously slandering the just struggle of overseas Chinese against persecution. An article in the 28th issue of the Soviet revisionist "New Times" magazine even slanders the overseas Chinese's protest against the Ne Win reactionary government's bloody atrocities as China's attempt to "spread hatred and enmity towards neighboring countries."

The Ne Win reactionary government's large-scale persecution and massacre of overseas Chinese, savage attacks on the Chinese embassy, and brutal murder of Chinese experts in Burma are sheer banditry, unadulterated Nazi-style racial madness. However, Tass turned black into white, slandering the Chinese people's protest demonstrations against the Burmese reactionaries' anti-China atrocities as "nationalist frenzy." The "Izvestia" on July 8th even absurdly claimed that this was China "blatantly interfering in the internal affairs of other countries."

The Soviet revisionists openly came out to support the Ne Win clique, offering advice and fanning the flames, supporting the Ne Win clique's anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people actions. This further exposed them as the backers of the Burmese reactionaries and the sworn enemies of the revolutionary people of the world.

The dying Burmese reactionaries have already fallen into the sea of flames of the people's war led by the Burmese Communist Party. The great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought has deeply entered the hearts of the Burmese revolutionary people, becoming their banner of struggle and victory. The Burmese reactionaries will inevitably perish, and the Burmese people's revolutionary struggle will surely achieve final victory. The revolutionary friendship and combat unity between the peoples of China and Burma will last forever. No matter whether it is the U.S. imperialists, the Soviet revisionists, or the Ne Win reactionary clique, attempting to change the inevitable laws of historical development is in vain. The Soviet revisionists, in collusion with the U.S. imperialists, together with the Ne Win reactionary government to oppose China, can only further accelerate their own doom.

    开动全部宣传机器为奈温政府反华助威
    苏修集团是缅甸反动派的后台老板
    新华社十四日讯  奈温反动政府秉承美帝和苏修的意旨，疯狂地制造反华排华的法西斯暴行后，苏修领导集团立即从幕后走到前台，开动全部宣传机器为缅甸反动派呐喊助威。
    缅甸反动政府这次反华排华，是美帝、苏修策划和制造的反华浪潮的一个组成部分，是奈温集团奉行独裁、卖国、反共、反人民政策的必然结果。但是苏修统治集团的喉舌塔斯社六月二十八日却胡说什么这次事件是“华侨学生”引起的。
    爱国华侨热爱伟大的领袖毛主席，学习毛主席著作，佩戴毛主席像章是天经地义的，是神圣不可侵犯的权利。但是苏修《真理报》七月一日却发表反华文章，诬蔑在缅甸的华侨戴毛主席像章是“挑衅行为”。
    苏修集团丧心病狂，对奈温反动集团残暴殴打、逮捕和屠杀华侨的法西斯兽行倍加赞扬，而对华侨反迫害的正义斗争却大肆诽谤。苏修《新时代》杂志第二十八期发表的文章，竟把华侨对奈温反动政府的血腥暴行的抗议，诬蔑为中国“企图在华侨中散布对邻国的敌视和仇恨。”
    奈温反动政府大规模迫害和屠杀华侨、野蛮袭击中国大使馆、残暴杀害中国援缅专家的罪行，是彻头彻尾的强盗行径，是不折不扣的纳粹式的种族主义狂。但是塔斯社却颠倒黑白，把中国人民抗议缅甸反动派反华暴行的示威游行，诬蔑为“民族主义狂热”，《消息报》七月八日竟胡说什么这是中国“在肆无忌惮地干涉他国事务”。
    苏修集团公开站出来为奈温集团帮腔，出谋献策，煽风点火，支持奈温集团反华、反共、反人民，进一步暴露了他们是缅甸反动派的后台老板，是世界革命人民的死敌。
    垂死挣扎的缅甸反动派，已陷入缅共领导的革命的人民战争的火海之中。伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，已深入缅甸革命人民的心中，成为他们战斗和胜利的旗帜。缅甸反动派必将灭亡，缅甸人民的革命斗争必将取得最后胜利，中缅两国人民的革命友谊和战斗团结将万世长存。不管是美帝、苏修，还是奈温反动集团，妄图改变历史发展的必然规律都是徒劳的。苏修同美帝勾结一起伙同奈温反动政府反华，只能进一步加速他们的灭亡。
