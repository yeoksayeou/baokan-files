The armed struggle of the farmers in Darjeeling, India, is like a bright beacon illuminating the dark land of India; it is also like a red signal flare ascending into the sky, heralding a great storm of revolutionary armed struggle that is about to sweep across India. The Indian reactionaries are terrified in the face of this revolutionary storm. They cry out that the peasant uprising in Darjeeling "will turn into a national disaster." However, the revolutionary people of India see in the spark of Darjeeling the path to liberation, and thus they are exhilarated and shout, "Red salute to Naxalbari!"

Where there is oppression, there is resistance.

The Indian landlords and big bourgeoisie, in collusion with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, are madly engaged in suppression and exploitation, causing the broad masses of the Indian people to live in dire straits.

Our unit participated in the 1962 Sino-Indian border self-defense counterattack. Through contact with Indian POWs, we have a deep impression of the heavy suffering endured by the Indian working people under the reactionary rule. For example, some Indian soldiers in the POW camp said, "In China, we truly lived a human life. I would like to be a POW in China for the rest of my life." This simple sentence is the blood-curdling accusation of the thousands and millions of suffering Indian working people against the Indian reactionaries!

In recent years, the Indian reactionaries, under the pretext of frenzied anti-China sentiment, have intensified their dependence on U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, making India increasingly a new type of colony of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. Domestically, they have intensified plunder and exploitation, causing nationwide famines and making people's lives unbearable. However, the Indian reactionaries' scheme to use anti-China sentiment to divert the attention of the Indian people and maintain their reactionary rule has failed. Since last year, the Indian people's struggle against tyranny and for survival has surged and developed vigorously. Recently, the farmers of Darjeeling, under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Indian Communist Party, have raised the banner of armed struggle, taken up arms, and rebelled.

To take up arms and engage in armed struggle is the only correct path for the Indian people to achieve liberation. Chairman Mao teaches us, "The central task and highest form of the revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally applicable, whether in China or abroad, it is universally correct."

For a long time, the Indian people have been in constant struggle with the Indian reactionaries. However, their strikes, grain seizures, land seizures, and other forms of struggle have never fundamentally improved their situation and often ended in failure under the armed suppression of the reactionary government. This has led the Indian people to rethink their own problems. Revolutionary Indian people have gradually seen through the revisionist goods peddled by the Danji traitor clique. Things like "parliamentary road" and "peaceful transition" have all failed in the eyes of the revolutionary people of India. The correct revolutionary path pointed out by Chairman Mao—this is the conclusion.

Chairman Mao teaches us:

"To make a revolution, one must have a revolutionary party. Without a revolutionary party, without a party built on the revolutionary theory and style of Marxism-Leninism, it is impossible to lead the working class and the broad masses of the people to defeat imperialism and its running dogs." After experiencing countless setbacks and great sacrifices, the Indian people have finally understood this truth. Today, the revolutionary faction within the Indian Communist Party has emerged from the struggle against domestic and foreign revisionist forces and has ignited the flames of armed struggle in Darjeeling County, leading the peasants to establish revolutionary base areas. Having such a correct leadership core is an important guarantee for the victory of the Indian people's revolution.

The red area of Darjeeling County is still small, but it is the great hope of the Indian people's revolution. The development of all new things is from small to large, from weak to strong, and finally to victory. The Chinese revolution was like this in the past, and the Indian revolution will surely be like this today. The Indian reactionaries are now trying to suppress the revolutionary people of Darjeeling. However, we deeply felt in the Sino-Indian border self-defense counterattack that the Indian reactionaries are paper tigers and can be completely defeated. "A single spark can start a prairie fire." As long as the revolutionary faction of the Indian Communist Party holds high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, persists in armed struggle, and wages people's war, the spark of armed struggle in Darjeeling will surely become a raging inferno across India.

This major development in the Indian people's revolutionary struggle not only tolls the death knell for the Indian reactionaries but is also a heavy blow to U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. The comrades of the Indian Communist Party's revolutionary faction are doing the right thing and doing it well! We firmly believe that, with the strong support of the revolutionary people of the world, the revolutionary faction of the Indian Communist Party will surely rapidly strengthen its forces and advance from victory to victory.

    印度人民的希望
    解放军成都部队某部模范尖刀连
    印度大吉岭农民的武装斗争，象一盏高悬的明灯，把印度这块黑暗的土地照得通亮；也象一颗腾空而起的红色信号，预示着一场革命武装斗争的伟大风暴，即将在印度全国兴起。印度反动派在这场革命风暴面前，吓得失魂落魄。他们惊呼，大吉岭的农民暴动“将会变成全国性的灾难”。但是，印度的革命人民却通过大吉岭的星星之火，看到了通向解放的前途，因此他们振奋欢呼，“向纳萨尔巴里致以红色敬礼”。
    那里有压迫，那里就有反抗。
    印度大地主、大资产阶级勾结美帝苏修，疯狂地进行镇压、剥削，使广大印度人民生活在水深火热之中。
    我们连曾经参加过一九六二年中印边境自卫反击战。通过同印军俘虏的接触，我们对印度劳动人民在反动统治下所遭受的沉重灾难有着深刻的印象。例如，有的印度士兵在俘虏营里说：“在中国，我们才真正过上了人的生活，我愿在中国当一辈子俘虏兵。”这简单的一句话，正是千百万受苦受难的印度劳动人民对印度反动派的血泪控诉！
    近几年来，印度反动派打着疯狂反华的幌子，对外加紧投靠美帝、苏修，使印度日益沦为美帝、苏修的新型殖民地；在国内加紧掠夺、剥削，使全国连年饥荒，民不聊生。但是，印度反动派用反华来转移印度人民的视线、维持它的反动统治的阴谋失败了。去年以来，印度人民反暴政、争生存的斗争风起云涌，蓬勃发展。最近，大吉岭的农民在印度共产党革命派的领导下，高举武装斗争的义旗，拿起枪杆子来造反了。
    拿起枪杆来进行武装斗争，这是印度人民争取解放的唯一正确的道路。毛主席教导我们：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”
    长期以来，印度人民曾经同印度反动派不断进行斗争，但是，他们的罢工、抢粮、夺地等等各种斗争，总是不能根本改善自己的处境，而且经常在反动政府的武装镇压下遭到失败。这就促使印度人民不能不重新考虑自己的问题。革命的印度人民逐渐认清了丹吉叛徒集团推行的那套修正主义货色。什么“议会道路”，什么“和平过渡”，在印度革命人民的心目中，统统破产了。走毛主席指出的正确的革命道路——这就是结论。
    毛主席教导我们说：
  “既要革命，就要有一个革命党。没有一个革命的党，没有一个按照马克思列宁主义的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的革命党，就不可能领导工人阶级和广大人民群众战胜帝国主义及其走狗。”印度人民在经受了无数的挫折和重大牺牲以后，终于懂得了这一真理。今天，印度共产党内的革命派，在同国内外修正主义势力斗争中杀出来了，并且在大吉岭县点燃了武装斗争的烈火，领导农民建立了革命根据地。有了这样一个正确的领导核心，就是印度人民革命取得胜利的一个重要保证。
    大吉岭县的这块红色地区虽然还是很小的，但却是印度人民革命的伟大希望。一切新生事物的发展，都是由小到大，由弱到强，最后取得胜利的。过去中国革命是这样，今天印度革命也必将是这样。印度反动派现在想对大吉岭的革命人民进行疯狂的镇压。但是，我们在中印边境自卫反击战中深深体会到，印度反动派是纸老虎，是完全可以打败的。“星星之火，可以燎原”。只要印度共产党革命派，高举马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的伟大红旗，坚持武装斗争，开展人民战争，大吉岭的武装斗争的星星之火，必将在印度全国形成燎原的烈焰。
    印度人民的革命斗争的这个重大发展，不仅敲响了印度反动派的丧钟，而且也是对美帝、苏修的沉重打击。印共革命派的战友干得对，干得好！我们坚信，印共革命派在全世界革命人民的大力支持下，一定能够迅速壮大自己的力量，从胜利走向胜利。
