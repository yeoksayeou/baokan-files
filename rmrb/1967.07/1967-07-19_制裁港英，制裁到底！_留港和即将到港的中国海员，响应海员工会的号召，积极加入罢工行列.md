The Hong Kong Seamen's Union's Committee to Oppose British Persecution issued a call on July 17 for concrete actions to refuse the transportation of goods in and out of Hong Kong to sanction the British in Hong Kong. Chinese seamen in Hong Kong and those about to arrive in Hong Kong have responded enthusiastically and immediately taken action, joining the ranks of the anti-British struggle. They resolutely declare that to defend Mao Zedong Thought and to counter the British imperialists' mad repression, Chinese seamen have made up their minds to sanction the British in Hong Kong, to sanction them to the end!

On the morning of July 17, the seamen of the 10,000-ton cargo ship "Chilung Fu Lu," which had just arrived from Japan, joined the strike as soon as they docked. During their voyage overseas, the seamen had prepared themselves mentally for the strike. When they were about to arrive in Hong Kong, they heard the call to refuse the transportation of goods in and out of Hong Kong to sanction the British in Hong Kong. They immediately packed their bags, and upon arrival, they left the ship and joined the strike.

The seamen of a cargo ship that arrived in Hong Kong on July 16 also went on strike. On July 17, when the shipping company notified them to handle their voyage documents, the seamen all resolutely refused. They pointed out: "The British in Hong Kong have gone mad, and in recent days, they have intensified their persecution of our patriotic compatriots. Even our workers' club has been savagely searched and looted. To protest against the fascist persecution of British imperialism and to maintain national dignity, we must resolutely participate in the strike action to sanction the British in Hong Kong." The seamen firmly declared: "Even if we starve, we will resolutely continue the strike!"

The crew of the cargo ship "Da Bao Shi," which was on its way from Singapore to Hong Kong, heard the news of sanctioning the British in Hong Kong while en route. They immediately informed the seamen's union via radio on the afternoon of July 17, expressing their resolute support for the call. They packed their bags in advance and made all preparations, ready to join the strike as soon as they arrived in Hong Kong. The seamen of the cargo ships "Da Zhong Shan" and "Da Long Shan," which had already arrived, also resolutely declared: "To defend Mao Zedong Thought and to protect national dignity, even if they point guns at us, we will resolutely leave the ship to join the strike."

Chinese seamen in Hong Kong, upon hearing the news of sanctioning the British in Hong Kong, rushed back to the union to report and participate in the sanctioning action. A seaman who had already completed the formalities to board the ship immediately declared to the shipping company, "The British in Hong Kong will not bow their heads, and I will not board the ship." An elderly seaman in his sixties, who had already retired, brought his son to the union, excitedly saying, "My son and I will both resolutely participate in this anti-British struggle. We will not be traitors to the nation."

The responsible person of the Seamen's Union's Fighting Committee highly praised the seamen's resolute actions. He said, Hong Kong seamen have inherited and carried forward the glorious anti-imperialist and patriotic tradition. This time, sanctioning the British in Hong Kong is good, fighting is good, greatly boosting the morale of Hong Kong compatriots and greatly dampening the arrogance of British imperialism. We have now fired a powerful shot in the seamen's sanctioning of the British in Hong Kong. In the future, we will give the wicked British imperialism even more severe punishment!

    制裁港英，制裁到底！
    留港和即将到港的中国海员，响应海员工会的号召，积极加入罢工行列
    新华社香港十八日电  香港海员工会反对港英迫害斗争委员会十七日发出以拒绝运输货物进出香港的实际行动制裁港英的号召后，留港中国海员和即将抵达香港的远洋货轮中国海员，纷纷响应，立即行动起来，投入这场反英抗暴斗争。他们坚决表示，为了捍卫毛泽东思想，为了反击英帝国主义的疯狂镇压，中国海员已下定决心制裁港英，制裁到底！
    十七日上午，从日本开抵香港的万吨货轮“奇连福禄号”的海员，一到码头就参加罢工。海员们在海外航行时就作好罢工的思想准备，当他们快要抵达香港时，听到拒绝运输货物进出香港制裁港英的号召，马上收拾行李，到港后他们立即离船，参加罢工行列。
    一艘十六日抵港的货轮“奥图连加士号”的海员，到香港后也举行罢工。十七日轮船公司通知他们办理航行手续时，海员们都坚决拒绝，他们指出：“港英现在已疯狂到了极点，连日来变本加厉地迫害我爱国同胞，连我们的工人俱乐部也遭到野蛮的搜查和劫掠。为了抗议英帝国主义的法西斯迫害，为了维护民族尊严，我们要坚决参加罢工行动，制裁港英。”海员们坚定地表示：“即使挨饿，我们也要坚决罢下去！”
    正在从新加坡来港的“大宝石号”货轮船员，途中得悉制裁港英的消息后，马上于十七日下午用无线电话告知海员工会，表示坚决响应号召，预先收拾好行李，作好一切准备，一到香港就立即参加罢工。已抵港的“大中山”、“大龙山”等货轮海员，也坚决表示：“为了捍卫毛泽东思想，为了保卫民族尊严，即使用枪指着我们，我们也要坚决离船参加罢工。”
    留港的海员听到要制裁港英的消息后，纷纷赶回工会报到，参加制裁行动。有一个早已办好手续准备登船的海员立即向轮船公司声明，“港英一日不低头，我一天不登船”。有一个已经退休的六十多岁的老海员，带着儿子到工会激动地说，“我和我儿子都要坚决参加这场反英抗暴斗争，我们决不做民族败类。”
    海员工会斗委会负责人对海员工人的坚决行动，表示热烈赞扬。他说，香港海员工人继承和发扬了光荣的反帝爱国传统，这次制裁港英制裁得好，斗得好，大长了香港同胞的志气，大灭了英帝国主义的威风。我们现在已打响了海员制裁港英的有力的一炮，今后还要给万恶的英帝国主义以更严厉的惩罚！
