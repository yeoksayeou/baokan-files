Nearly 20,000 shipbuilders in the United States have been on strike for the past four days and five nights, and the strike is still ongoing. This strike has paralyzed the construction of five nuclear submarines for the U.S. Navy.

The strike, which began on the evening of July 10 at the "Newport News Shipbuilding and Dry Dock Company" in Virginia, has brought the company's work to a standstill. The company is responsible for building five nuclear submarines for the U.S. Navy.

On the night of July 11, after the striking workers clashed with the police, the frightened reactionary authorities immediately dispatched a large number of mounted police to the shipyard the next morning to "assist in maintaining order." That evening, fully armed police, wearing steel helmets and wielding batons, and unleashing police dogs, attempted to forcibly disperse the striking workers gathered at the shipyard's entrance. However, more than a thousand striking workers stood their ground. They charged towards the police, shouting loudly and throwing bricks and glass bottles, forcing the police to retreat repeatedly. Later, the authorities even mobilized cavalry, charging in dense formations towards the striking workers, who were then forced to temporarily retreat to nearby streets.

The Associated Press reported uneasily that over the course of two nights of conflict, the streets of this small town had become "open battlefields."

According to reports, the striking workers destroyed five police cars. Thirty striking workers were arrested, and approximately twenty-five were injured.

    美国近两万造船工人坚持大罢工
    罢工使美海军五艘核潜艇的建造工程陷于瘫痪
    新华社十五日讯　华盛顿消息：美国弗吉尼亚州“纽波特纽斯船舶修建公司”（前译为“纽波特纽斯造船和干船坞公司”）近两万名工人十日晚上开始的大罢工到十四日为止已经持续四天五夜，而且还在坚持中。这家公司替美国海军建造五艘核潜艇的工程已被迫陷于瘫痪。
    在十一日晚间罢工工人同警察英勇奋战之后，吓破了胆的反动当局在第二天一早立即出动了大批骑兵前往这家造船厂“协助维持秩序”。当天晚间，全副武装的警察头戴钢盔，挥舞警棍，并放出警犬，妄图把集结在造船厂大门口的罢工工人强行驱散。但是一千多名罢工工人毫不退缩。他们迎着警察冲过去，一面大声呼喊，一面投掷砖块和玻璃瓶，迫使警察连连后退。后来当局竟然调动骑兵，以密集的队形向罢工工人猛冲，工人才不得不暂时撤到了附近的街道上。
    美联社在报道中不安地谈到，在接连两晚的冲突中，这个小市镇的街道简直成了“公开作战的”场所。
    据报道，罢工工人共捣毁了五辆警车。罢工工人有三十人被捕，大约二十五人受伤。
