The heroic armed forces of South Vietnam have, since the beginning of this year, opened a new battlefield south of the demilitarized zone and achieved a great victory. They have tied down a large number of enemy troops, annihilated a considerable number of enemy combat forces, and disrupted the U.S. imperialists' deployment throughout the battlefield in South Vietnam.

In the battlefield south of the demilitarized zone, the U.S. imperialists have deployed their land, air, and naval forces, using all kinds of modern weapons except atomic bombs. They appear fierce, but once they engage with the liberation forces, they reveal their true nature as paper tigers. Now, the area south of the demilitarized zone, where the U.S. has invested heavily, has become the graveyard where the American aggressors suffer the heaviest casualties and the most humiliating defeats in South Vietnam. From Saigon to Washington, the U.S. and puppet military and political leaders are crying out about the serious situation in the battlefield south of the demilitarized zone, where the U.S. Marine Corps is said to be "unable to cope."

Since the beginning of this year, the liberation forces south of the demilitarized zone have relentlessly attacked the U.S. aggressors, giving them no respite. From January to May, in the provinces of Quang Tri and Thua Thien, they have annihilated and disbanded over 30,000 U.S. and puppet troops. The U.S. Marine Corps, with several tens of thousands of troops, has been decimated, with the Third Marine Amphibious Force alone losing two-thirds of its strength, reducing a force of 12,000 to just 4,000. Starting in early July, the liberation forces launched continuous and fierce attacks on U.S. bases near the demilitarized zone, such as Khe Sanh, Dong Ha, and Yue Ling. In just five days, from July 2nd to 6th, they killed and wounded over 1,300 American aggressors in the Yue Ling area alone.

The area south of the demilitarized zone is an important battlefield opened by the liberation forces of South Vietnam at the beginning of this year. The heavy blows dealt to the enemy here have made them extremely disorganized. Under the powerful offensive of the liberation forces, the U.S. military leaders, in order to save their troops south of the demilitarized zone, had to transfer forces from the central and southern battlefields as reinforcements. However, this left the central and southern battlefields even more vulnerable. The liberation forces launched an offensive in the central highlands, and the U.S. commander in Vietnam, Westmoreland, hurriedly transferred the 173rd Airborne Brigade, which was guarding the Saigon stronghold, to the central battlefield. But the U.S. aggressors in the southern region became even more panicked after the 173rd Airborne Brigade was transferred, and the liberation forces seized the opportunity to launch offensives in the areas around Saigon and the Mekong Delta, annihilating a large number of U.S. and puppet troops.

In the five provinces south of the demilitarized zone, the liberation forces have tied down 75,000 U.S. Marines and a large number of U.S. Army troops, as well as puppet and mercenary forces. Nearly three divisions of U.S. and puppet troops have been pinned down in the provinces of Quang Tri and Thua Thien, covering an area of just 9,000 square kilometers, and are being gradually annihilated. This great victory has shattered the U.S. aggressors' dream of sealing off the temporary military demarcation line and "annihilating" the main forces of the liberation forces south of the demilitarized zone, disrupting the U.S. imperialists' entire deployment in the South Vietnamese battlefield.

The liberation forces have firmly grasped the initiative on the battlefield south of the demilitarized zone. The U.S. propaganda machine admits that the U.S. aggressors in this region "have repeatedly been forced to engage in combat at times and places chosen by the enemy (referring to the liberation forces)." The American troops are being led by the nose by the liberation forces. Whether the enemy hides in their strongholds or ventures out, they are subjected to sudden attacks by the liberation forces. No U.S. and puppet military airfields, artillery positions, barracks, puppet government institutions, or U.S. command posts have escaped the heavy blows of the liberation forces.

The artillery experts of the liberation forces have also shown their prowess south of the demilitarized zone. U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara recently experienced the power of the liberation forces' artillery when he visited the South Vietnamese battlefield. He had planned to go to the Dong Ha base on July 9th to boost the morale of the American aggressors. But the liberation forces opened fire to "welcome" him the day before, destroying eleven helicopters parked at the Dong Ha airfield. This frightened McNamara into canceling his original plan and could only circle around in a helicopter above the demilitarized zone, not daring to land.

The liberation forces south of the demilitarized zone have fully demonstrated the mighty power of the people's war. In battle, they are clever and brave, using their strengths to attack the enemy's weaknesses, and annihilating the enemy by whole companies and battalions in close combat. The liberation forces in the northern part of Quang Tri once infiltrated the U.S. military stronghold and underground tunnels near the Xuan My, annihilating all 160 enemy troops in close combat. The next day, in an ambush, they killed over 200 more U.S. troops coming to reinforce. On July 2nd, the liberation forces engaged in a close-quarters battle with the U.S. Marines who had just crawled out of their outposts in the rugged terrain near Khe Sanh, killing and wounding over 200 American aggressors in one day.

The people's guerrilla forces in the region south of the demilitarized zone are also growing stronger. They have not only annihilated a large number of puppet troops and "pacification officials" but have also frequently fought the U.S. aggressors, who are armed with airplanes and cannons, to a standstill.

The great victories achieved by the liberation forces south of the demilitarized zone have made the enemy extremely panicked. The U.S. News and World Report recently admitted, "Now, (the initiative) is to a large extent on the Communist (referring to the liberation forces) side. American actions have to a large extent become 'containment actions.' 'Nearly 500,000 American troops can barely hold their positions.'"

The great victories achieved by the liberation forces south of the demilitarized zone are another triumphant song of the people's war. This victory once again proves the wisdom of Chairman Mao's statement: "The people are the decisive factor. Relying on the unity and struggle of the people, we must be able to defeat imperialism and its running dogs."

The great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "Anything reactionary will not fall if you do not beat it. This is also like sweeping the floor; if the broom does not reach, the dust will not run away by itself." Although the U.S. imperialists have suffered repeated defeats and are facing numerous difficulties, they will not accept their own failure. They will still cling to the battlefield south of the demilitarized zone, still attempt new adventures to expand their aggression, and still play the counter-revolutionary trick of "war and peace." However, the U.S. imperialists, who have lost the support of the people, no matter how they struggle in their dying moments, will not be able to save themselves from their ultimate failure on the South Vietnamese battlefield.

    在非军事区南开辟新战场　消灭敌人有生力量　打乱美帝侵略部署
    南越解放武装力量打出一片大好形势
    新华社二十五日讯　本社记者述评：英雄的越南南方解放武装力量，今年以来，在新开辟的非军事区以南的战场上，打出了一片大好形势。他们在那里拖住了大量敌人，消灭了大批敌人的有生力量，打乱了美帝国主义在整个南越战场上的部署。
    在非军事区以南的战场上，美帝国主义出动了陆空海三军，使用了除原子弹以外的各种现代化武器，表面上气势凶凶，但是一经与解放武装力量较量，立即现出了它外强中干的纸老虎原形。现在，美帝在南越投下大量赌注的非军事区以南地区，已成为美国侵略军在南越死伤最重、败得最惨的坟场。从西贡到华盛顿，美伪军政头目们连声叫嚷非军事区以南战场的局势严重，那里的美国海军陆战队已经“无法应付”。
    今年年初开始，非军事区以南的解放武装力量不断揪住美国侵略军狠打，不给敌人以喘息的余地，从一月到五月，在非军事区以南的广治、承天两省，已消灭和瓦解美伪军三万多人。美国海军陆战队几万人已被打得七零八落，其中美国海军陆战队第三两栖部队已被歼三分之二，一万二千人的队伍只剩下四千人了。七月初开始，解放武装力量又对靠近非军事区的昆天、东河和犹灵等美军基地发动接连不断的猛烈攻击，从二日到六日五天内，单在犹灵一带就打死打伤美国强盗一千三百多人。
    非军事区以南地区是南越解放武装力量在今年初开辟的重要战场。解放武装力量在这里对敌人的重大打击，使敌人十分狼狈。在解放武装力量强大攻势下，侵越美军头目为了给非军事区以南的美军救命，不得不挖肉补疮，从中部和南部战场急调兵力增援。但是这样一来，中部和南部战场就更加空虚。解放武装力量在中部高原发动了攻势，侵越美军头子威斯特摩兰又慌忙把看守西贡老巢的第一七三空降旅调到中部战场去。但南部地区的美国侵略军却因调走了第一七三空降旅而更加慌乱，解放武装力量趁机在西贡周围地区和湄公河三角洲发动攻势，消灭了大量美伪军。
    解放武装力量在非军事区以南的五省内，拖住了美国海军陆战队七万五千人和大量美国陆军部队以及伪军和帮凶军，其中把近三个师的美伪军粘在紧靠非军事区的广治、承天两省的不过九千平方公里的土地上，一口一口地把他们吃掉。这一重大胜利，粉碎了美国侵略军企图封锁临时军事分界线和“围歼”非军事区以南解放武装力量主力部队的梦想，打乱了美帝国主义在南越战场上的整个部署。
    解放武装力量已经牢牢地掌握了非军事区以南战场上的主动权。美国宣传机器承认，美国侵略军在这个地区“一再被迫在敌人（指解放武装力量）所选择的时间和地点投入战斗”。美国少爷兵们被解放武装力量牵着鼻子打。敌人不论缩在据点里还是爬到外面来，都遭到解放武装力量的突然袭击。美伪军重兵把守的飞机场、炮兵阵地、兵营、伪政权机构和美国侵略军的指挥所，无一不挨过解放武装力量的狠揍。
    解放武装力量的神炮手在非军事区以南也大显威风。美国防部长麦克纳马拉最近到南越战场活动时，便亲自尝到了解放武装力量炮火的厉害。他原定九日到东河基地去给美国强盗打气。但解放武装力量在他到达的前一天就开炮“欢迎”，打坏了停在东河机场上的十一架直升飞机。吓得麦克纳马拉取消了原定计划，只得乘直升飞机在非军事区上空兜一个圈子，不敢下来。
    非军事区以南的解放武装力量充分发挥了人民战争的强大威力，在战斗中机智勇敢，以己之长攻敌之短，在近战中整连整营地歼灭敌人。广治北部的解放武装力量曾突入溪星附近的动治美军据点的工事和地道，在肉搏战中把守敌美军一百六十名全部消灭，第二天在伏击战中，又打死前来增援的美军两百多名。七月二日，解放武装力量在昆天附近的高低不平的山地上，和刚刚爬出哨所的美国海军陆战队展开了白刃战，一天之内，打死打伤两百多名美国鬼子。
    非军事区以南地区的人民游击队也越打越强。他们不仅消灭了大批伪军和“绥靖干部”，而且也经常把用飞机大炮武装起来的美国侵略军打得焦头烂额。
    解放武装力量在非军事区以南地区的重大胜利，使敌人十分惊慌。《美国新闻与世界报道》最近承认，“现在，（战场）主动权在较大程度上属于共产党（指解放武装力量）一边。美国的行动在很大程度上已变成‘牵制行动’。”“接近五十万人的美国军队，几乎守不住自己的阵地”。
    解放武装力量在非军事区以南地区的重大胜利，是人民战争的又一曲凯歌。这个胜利再一次证明了毛主席的英明论断：“人民是决定的因素，依靠人民的团结和斗争，必能战胜帝国主义和他们的走狗”。
    伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”美帝国主义虽然不断遭到惨败，困难重重，但它决不会甘心自己的失败。它还要在非军事区以南的战场上赖下去，还要进行扩大侵略战争的新冒险，还要玩弄战“和”两手的反革命阴谋。然而，失道寡助的美帝国主义不管还要怎样地进行垂死挣扎，都无法挽救它在南越战场彻底失败的命运。
