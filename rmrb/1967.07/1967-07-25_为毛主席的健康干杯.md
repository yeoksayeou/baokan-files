The Greek ship "Mitraili" is about to leave Qingdao Port. When the port workers went to seek their opinions, the captain of the ship said: We all love Chairman Mao and we all yearn to obtain Chairman Mao's badges. The port workers fulfilled their request and sent them the shining gold Chairman Mao badges. As the captain put the Chairman Mao badge on his chest, he said: Overseas, the United States is conducting reactionary propaganda, not allowing us to come to China, saying that China is bad. This time we came to China and saw that under Chairman Mao's leadership, construction is progressing rapidly. I must propagate what I have seen in China to the outside world. I am not afraid of persecution because China is indeed good. Finally, he invited the port workers to be his guests, raised his glass high, and with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao, said: "To Chairman Mao's health!"

    为毛主席的健康干杯
    希腊籍“密特拉伊利米”号商轮就要离开青岛港了。当港口工作人员去征求意见时，该轮船长说：我们都很热爱毛主席，都渴望得到毛主席的像章。港口工作人员满足了他们的要求，把金光闪闪的毛主席像章送给了他们。这位船长一边把毛主席像章戴在胸前，一边说：在国外，美国进行反动宣传，不让我们到中国来，说中国不好。这次我们来到中国，看到中国在毛主席的领导下，建设很快。我一定要把在中国看见的情况向外国宣传。我不怕迫害，因为中国确实好。最后，他又邀请港口工作人员作客，他把酒杯高高举起，怀着对伟大领袖毛主席无限热爱的心情说：“为毛主席的健康干杯！”
