New Delhi, July 8 (Xinhua) — The reactionary and traitorous government of India is conspiring, in accordance with the wishes of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, to rally some neighboring countries to form an anti-China military alliance.

Indian Foreign Minister Chagla announced in parliament on July 3 that the Indian government is considering holding meetings with Burma, Nepal, and Ceylon to discuss so-called measures against China. He said that members of the Congress Party and the opposition parties have urged the government to explore the possibility of signing a "defense treaty" with China's neighboring countries. It is clear that this is an attempt to organize an anti-China military alliance under the control of Indian reactionaries.

Chagla also brazenly interfered in Nepal's internal affairs and stirred up trouble between China and Nepal, claiming that the Kathmandu-Kodari highway, jointly built by Nepal and China, poses a "threat to India's security."

Since the beginning of this year, in order to adapt to the new wave of anti-China sentiment stirred up by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, the reactionary Indian government has become particularly active in rallying neighboring countries to join its anti-China efforts. Indian Foreign Minister Chagla visited Indonesia and Burma in January. Along the way, he loudly proclaimed the so-called "Chinese threat" and viciously slandered China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

In Indonesia, Chagla openly called for supporting the fascist regime in Indonesia to form an anti-China alliance in Southeast Asia. He himself peddled an anti-China alliance under the guise of an "Asian Common Market." In Burma, he also rallied the Burmese government to join India in its anti-China efforts.

The reactionary and traitorous Indian government, in order to curry favor with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, has spared no effort in frenziedly opposing China. It foolishly hopes that by doing so, it can beg for food and loans from U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism to alleviate its political and economic difficulties and divert the attention of its people. However, the Indian reactionaries' actions not only fail to solve their own political and economic problems but also lead to the gradual loss of India's sovereignty and national interests. This can only be described as lifting a rock to drop it on one's own feet.

### 印度反动派奉行美帝苏修的意旨阴谋拉拢邻国拼凑反华军事联盟

　　印度反动派奉行美帝苏修的意旨阴谋拉拢邻国拼凑反华军事联盟
    新华社八日讯　新德里消息：印度反动卖国政府正在按照美帝苏修的意图，阴谋拉拢一些邻国组织反华军事联盟。
    印度外交部长查格拉三日在议会上宣布，印度政府正在考虑同缅甸、尼泊尔和锡兰举行会议，研究所谓对付中国的问题。他说，国大党和反对党的议员都要求政府研究是否有可能同中国的邻国签订一个“防御条约”。很明显，这是企图组织在印度反动派控制下的反华军事联盟。
    查格拉还粗暴地干涉尼泊尔内政和挑拨中尼关系，硬说尼泊尔和中国合作修建的加德满都—科达里公路是“对印度安全的威胁”。
    从今年年初起，为了适应美帝和苏修掀起新的反华浪潮的需要，印度反动政府拉拢邻国反华的活动变得特别频繁，印度外长查格拉在一月间曾经到印尼和缅甸活动。他一路上大肆叫嚷所谓“中国的威胁”，并恶毒地污蔑中国的无产阶级文化大革命。
    查格拉在印尼时露骨地叫嚷要支持印尼法西斯政权在东南亚拼凑反华联盟。他自己也兜售以“亚洲共同市场”为名的反华联盟。他在缅甸时，还拉拢缅甸政府同印度政府一起反华。
    印度反动卖国政府为了讨好美帝苏修，不惜大卖力气，疯狂反华。它妄想靠这一手向美帝苏修乞讨粮食和借款来缓和它面临的政治和经济困难，并转移国内人民的视线。但是，印度反动派这样做不但没有解决本身的政治和经济困难，而且使印度的主权和民族利益日益丧失，这只能是搬起石头打自己的脚。
