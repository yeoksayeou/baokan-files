New China News Agency Correspondent in Rangoon Departs for Home
Chinese Embassy Staff and Patriotic Overseas Chinese Send Off Despite Rain; Burmese Military and Police on High Alert

New China News Agency, July 17th: Rangoon News: The New China News Agency correspondent in Rangoon, Yu Mingsheng, who was unjustly ordered to leave Burma by the Burmese reactionary government, departed Rangoon on a Chinese civilian aircraft this morning.

Those who came to the airport to see him off included the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy in Burma, Xiao Ming, embassy staff, representatives of Chinese experts working in Burma, representatives of the New China News Agency in Rangoon and the Chinese Civil Aviation Company, as well as representatives of patriotic overseas Chinese.

Vietnam News Agency reporters and some foreign friends also came to the airport to see him off.

Early in the morning of the 17th, from the Chinese Embassy to Rangoon Airport, Burmese soldiers and plainclothes agents were on high alert, as if facing a major threat. At 10:00 AM, all Chinese comrades in Rangoon gathered at the embassy to hold a warm send-off for Yu Mingsheng. They took photos together and read aloud Chairman Mao's quotes: "Resolve to make sacrifices, dare to face difficulties, and strive for victory."

On the airport, heavily guarded by soldiers and plainclothes agents, many plainclothes agents pretending to be photographers walked around Yu Mingsheng with cameras. Yu Mingsheng distributed protest statements from the New China News Agency and the New China News Agency in Rangoon regarding the Ne Win reactionary government's unjust order for New China News Agency correspondents to leave Burma in the airport lounge.

Before Yu Mingsheng boarded the plane, Chinese comrades read aloud Chairman Mao's quotes in the rain. Although overseas Chinese could not approach Yu Mingsheng, they applauded from a distance when Chinese comrades read Chairman Mao's quotes. Yu Mingsheng raised the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and saluted them.

According to the New China News Agency in Paris on the 16th, Northzawa Masao, an executive committee member of the Asia-Africa People's Solidarity Committee of Japan, stated during his visit to Paris that the anti-China actions of the Burmese reactionaries are entirely in line with the needs of the U.S. imperialists' policy of "containment" against China and are supported by Soviet modern revisionists and their old and new followers.

He said: "In some Asian and African countries, the bureaucratic bourgeoisie or military cliques in power are facing increasingly high levels of mass struggles against imperialism and for complete national liberation. Therefore, they feel isolated. These reactionaries, while intensifying the oppression of the masses, are trying to sell their countries to the 'holy alliance' of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism and adopt an hostile attitude towards China, the fortress of today's world revolution. Burma is no exception." Northzawa Masao pointed out that the Burmese people are intensifying their armed struggle against the reactionary rule. No matter how difficult it is, no matter what obstacles they encounter, the struggle of the Burmese people will definitely achieve final victory.

    新华社驻仰光分社记者启程回国
    我使馆人员爱国华侨冒雨相送　缅甸军警戒备森严如临大敌
    新华社十七日讯　仰光消息：被缅甸反动政府无理限期离开缅甸的新华社驻仰光分社记者于民生，今天上午乘中国民航飞机离开仰光回国。
    到机场欢送的有中国驻缅甸大使馆临时代办肖明、大使馆人员、在缅甸工作的中国专家代表，新华社仰光分社和中国民航公司的代表以及爱国华侨的代表。
    越南通讯社记者和一些外国朋友也到机场欢送。
    十七日清早，从中国大使馆到仰光机场的路上，缅甸士兵和便衣特务戒备森严，如临大敌。上午十时，在仰光的全体中国同志在大使馆为于民生举行了热烈的欢送，他们一起照相，一起朗读毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    在士兵和便衣特务警卫森严的机场上，手持照相机假装成摄影师的许多便衣特务在于民生四周走来走去。于民生在机场的休息室散发了新华通讯社和新华社驻仰光分社就奈温反动政府无理限期新华社记者离开缅甸提出的抗议声明。
    在于民生登上飞机以前，中国同志们冒雨高声朗读毛主席语录。虽然华侨不能接近于民生，但是在中国同志们朗读毛主席语录时，他们在远处鼓掌。于民生高举《毛主席语录》，向他们致意。
    据新华社巴黎十六日电　亚非人民团结日本委员会执行委员北泽政雄在巴黎访问期间向新华社记者发表谈话指出，缅甸反动派的反华行动，完全是适应美帝国主义奉行的“遏制”中国的政策的需要的，并得到苏联现代修正主义者及其新老追随者的支持。
    他说：“现在在一些亚非国家中，当政的官僚资产阶级或军事集团面临着越来越高涨的反对帝国主义和争取彻底民族解放的群众斗争，因此他们感到孤立。这些反动派为了保持他们的统治地位，在加紧压迫群众的同时，设法把本国出卖给美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义结成的‘神圣同盟’，并对今天世界革命的堡垒中国采取敌视态度。在缅甸也不例外。”北泽政雄指出，缅甸人民正在加紧进行反对反动统治的武装斗争。不管多么困难，不管遭到什么障碍，缅甸人民的斗争一定会取得最后胜利。
