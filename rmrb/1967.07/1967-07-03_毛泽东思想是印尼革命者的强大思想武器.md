Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon for Indonesian revolutionaries.

The publication of Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" sounded the charge. It called on revolutionaries, revolutionary literary and artistic workers in China and around the world to, under the guidance of correct theory, make literature and art truly "a powerful weapon for uniting the people, educating the people, attacking the enemy, and annihilating the enemy," helping the people to unite and fight against the enemy and liberate themselves from oppression and exploitation.

In this brilliant "Talks," Chairman Mao brilliantly, creatively, and comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed the Marxist-Leninist worldview and Marxist-Leninist literary theory. This work is a programmatic document of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, scientifically summarizing the fundamental experience of the Chinese revolutionary literary and art movement and the international proletarian revolutionary literary and art movement. This work most completely, systematically, and comprehensively summarizes the experience of the struggle between the two lines, two classes, and two worldviews on the cultural front. Chairman Mao creatively solved a series of fundamental problems in the revolutionary literary and art movement that Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin had not solved.

"The Talks" is the pinnacle of Marxist-Leninist literary theory. "The Talks" is not only the guiding star for the Chinese people to carry out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution but also the guiding star for the revolutionary people and literary and artistic workers in Asia, Africa, and Latin America to carry out their revolutions in their own countries.

"The Talks" has limitless vitality. It is not only the guiding principle for cultural work during the period of national democratic revolution but also the guiding principle for the period of socialist construction and socialist revolution. It is the guiding principle for consolidating and strengthening proletarian dictatorship to gradually transition to a communist society.

Chairman Mao pointed out that the question of "for whom" literature and art serve is a fundamental and principled question. This is the question of clearly demarcating the enemy from ourselves, the question of demarcating revolutionary proletarian literature and art from counter-revolutionary bourgeois literature and art. This is the focal point of the struggle between the two lines, namely, the revolutionary and counter-revolutionary lines; the two classes, namely, the proletariat, the oppressed class, and the bourgeoisie, the oppressing class; and the two worldviews, namely, Marxism-Leninism, Mao Zedong Thought, and counter-revolutionary revisionist worldviews.

Chairman Mao formulated the line of literature and art serving the workers, peasants, and soldiers, which means serving the fundamental interests of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. To serve the fundamental interests of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, Chairman Mao said, literary and artistic workers must "stand on the side of the proletariat and the masses. For Communist Party members, this means standing on the side of the Party, standing on the side of Party nature and Party policy." Only by taking this stance can writers and artists truly serve the needs of the struggle and the fundamental interests of the workers, peasants, and soldiers. Taking such a stance means that revolutionary literary and artistic workers must wholeheartedly devote themselves to the great cause of liberating the masses.

Literary and artistic workers must adopt specific attitudes toward various concrete things. One attitude is praise and love, and the other is exposure and condemnation. Workers, peasants, and soldiers should be praised and loved, while their enemies should be condemned and exposed. This is a clear dividing line in the class struggle regarding every concrete thing.

The modern revisionists, with the Soviet leadership as their center, loudly proclaim "humanism," "unity and solidarity of mankind," and "universal love." In reality, these are all bourgeois trash. They shout "humanism" precisely for the purpose of inhumanity. How can one shout "humanism" in the face of the savage behavior of American imperialism in Vietnam? According to the experience of Indonesian progressive literary and artistic workers, those who shout about "universal humanism" are the apologists for imperialism, feudalism, bureaucratic capitalists, and compradors, who are also colluding with revisionism. They oppose literature and art that serve the people and the workers, peasants, and soldiers. This is entirely the treacherous slogan of Soviet modern revisionists who oppose revolution, oppose the people, and oppose the people's struggle.

As Chairman Mao said: "In class society, there is only class-based humanity, and there is no such thing as classless humanity." The modern revisionists' "humanism," "unity and solidarity of mankind," and "universal love" stand on the side of the class that opposes people's liberation, and therefore, in reality, they themselves represent the anti-people class. Behind the "unity and solidarity of mankind," they implement the line of U.S.-Soviet collaboration to "dominate the world."

Under this traitorous slogan, the Soviet revisionist leadership is opening the door wide for the decadent "Western culture" of imperialism to flood into the Soviet Union, poisoning the young generation of the Soviet Union, undermining the proletarian dictatorship, and further paving the way for the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union.

Currently, Indonesian progressive literary and artistic workers believe that it is necessary to learn, understand, and apply the highest level of contemporary Marxism-Leninism—Mao Zedong Thought. Comrade Mao Zedong clearly pointed out that the task of literary and artistic workers and their literature and art on the cultural front before the revolution is to prepare ideological and public opinion work. This work must be closely combined with the work on the military front. In short, in the struggle to seize power from the reactionary rulers, the pen and the gun must be combined to seize political power. For Indonesian literary and artistic workers, their task is to arm themselves with Comrade Mao Zedong's thoughts on literature and art, create public opinion, and carry out ideological work. The urgent task of this work is how to turn the pen into a force that can "arouse, organize, and mobilize the peasants" so that, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, they can carry out an armed struggle to conduct an anti-feudal land revolution.

To create such works, one must follow Chairman Mao's instruction to "go to the masses, go to the masses unconditionally and wholeheartedly for a long time, go to the workers, peasants, and soldiers, go to the fiery struggle, go to the only broad and rich source, observe, experience, study, and analyze everything, all classes, all masses, all lively forms of life and struggle, all raw materials for literature and art." They must throw themselves into the masses and wholeheartedly unite with the people. Only through this path can they vividly portray the images of workers, peasants, and soldiers and know their boundless creativity.

Only by following Chairman Mao's teachings and closely uniting with the masses can the work of revolutionary literary and artistic workers have meaning.

Now, the revolutionary people of Indonesia, under the leadership of the Indonesian Communist Party armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, have found the new and correct political line to complete the Indonesian national democratic revolutionary struggle, which is the line of armed struggle armed with Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" has been published for twenty-five years. During this period, it has served the revolution and the oppressed people. It is during this period that literary and artistic workers in Asia, Africa, Latin America, and the world, especially Chinese literary and artistic workers, have obtained a powerful weapon to serve the people and the revolution. Chinese literary and artistic workers have used this weapon to successfully create epoch-making works. These works reflect the revolutionary struggle of the Chinese people under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, such as the modern revolutionary Beijing operas "Taking Tiger Mountain by Strategy," "The Port," "The Red Lantern," "The Battle of Sha Jian Hu," "The Red Detachment of Women," and "White-Haired Girl," the symphony "Sha Jian Hu," and the novel "The Song of Ouyang Hai," among other excellent model works.

Indonesian progressive literary and artistic workers believe, based on their own experience, that to thoroughly and correctly implement Comrade Mao Zedong's teachings on literature and art, one must adhere to the revolutionary path pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong. Only literary and artistic workers who hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought can become cultural warriors who wholeheartedly serve the people, and their literary and artistic works can become powerful weapons for the people to struggle for liberation. Only literary and artistic works under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought can become what Chairman Mao said: "Revolutionary culture is a powerful weapon for the people. Revolutionary culture, before the revolution, is the ideological preparation for the revolution; during the revolution, it is a necessary and important front in the overall revolutionary front." Indonesian progressive literary and artistic workers believe that while opposing imperialism led by the United States, they must also oppose its most vicious accomplice—the modern revisionism centered on the Soviet leadership. To thoroughly defeat imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries, especially the Indonesian reactionaries led by the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime, the only powerful weapon is the great Mao Zedong Thought.

　　毛泽东思想是印尼革命者的强大思想武器
　　印度尼西亚　阿费夫
    毛主席的《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》的发表吹响了进军的号角。它号召中国和全世界的革命者、革命的文学工作者和艺术工作者在正确的理论的指导下使文艺真正成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器，帮助人民同心同德地和敌人作斗争”，使人民从压迫和剥削下解放出来。
    毛主席在这篇光辉的《讲话》中天才地、创造性地、全面地继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义的世界观以及马克思列宁主义的文艺理论。这篇著作是无产阶级文化大革命的纲领性的重要文献，它科学地总结了中国革命文艺运动和国际无产阶级革命文艺运动的根本经验。这篇著作最完整、最系统、最全面地总结了文化战线上两条路线、两个阶级和两种世界观的斗争经验。毛主席在这篇光辉著作中创造性地解决了马克思、恩格斯、列宁、斯大林在革命文艺运动中未解决的一系列基本问题。
    《讲话》是马克思列宁主义文艺理论的顶峰。《讲话》不仅是指导中国人民进行无产阶级文化大革命的北斗星，同时也是指导亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲革命人民和文学艺术工作者在本国进行革命的北斗星。
    《讲话》具有无限的生命力，它不仅是民族民主革命时期文化工作战线上的指导方针，同时也是社会主义建设和社会主义革命时期的指导方针，是坚持、巩固和加强无产阶级专政以便逐步过渡到共产主义社会的指导方针。
    毛主席指出，文艺“为什么人的问题，是一个根本的问题，原则的问题。”这是明确地划清敌我界限的问题，是划清无产阶级革命文艺和资产阶级反革命文艺的界限问题。这是两条路线，即革命的和反革命的路线；两个阶级，即无产阶级、被压迫阶级和资产阶级、压迫阶级两个阶级；两个世界观，即马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想和反革命修正主义世界观之间的斗争焦点。
    毛主席制定文艺为工农兵服务的路线，这就是说为工农兵的根本利益服务。为了能够为工农兵的根本利益服务，毛主席说过，文学工作者和艺术工作者要“站在无产阶级的和人民大众的立场。对于共产党员来说，也就是要站在党的立场，站在党性和党的政策的立场。”只有采取这种立场，文学家和艺术家才可能真正为斗争需要和工农兵的根本利益服务。采取这样的立场就意味着革命的文学艺术工作者要全心全意地投入到为解放人民大众的伟大事业中去。
    文学艺术工作者要对各种具体事物采取具体态度。这个态度，一种是歌颂和热爱，另一种是暴露和谴责。对于工农兵应该歌颂和热爱，对于工农兵的敌人应该谴责和揭露。这是对待每一个具体事物鲜明的阶级界限的分水岭。
    以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义者大肆宣扬什么“人道主义”、“人类的统一和团结”和“博爱”，其实，他们鼓吹的这些完全是资产阶级的垃圾。他们大肆喧嚷“人道主义”恰恰是为了完全不人道的目的。人们怎能对美帝国主义在越南的野蛮行为大叫“人道主义”呢？根据印度尼西亚进步文学艺术工作者的经验，大叫大嚷“普遍的人道主义”的都是帝国主义、封建主义、官僚资本家和买办的辩护士，他们也是和修正主义勾结起来的。他们反对为人民大众和工农兵服务的文艺。这完全是苏联现代修正主义者反对革命、反对人民和人民斗争的叛徒口号。
    正如毛主席所说的：“在阶级社会里就是只有带着阶级性的人性，而没有什么超阶级的人性。”现代修正主义的“人道主义”、“人类的统一和团结”和“博爱”是站在反对人民解放这个阶级一边的，因此实际上他们自己代表了反人民的阶级。在“人类的统一和团结”的幕后，他们实行为了“主宰世界”的美苏合作路线。
    在这种叛徒口号下，苏修领导集团正在为帝国主义腐朽的“西方文化”在苏联泛滥敞开大门，用以毒害苏联年青一代，破坏无产阶级专政，以及为苏联资本主义复辟进一步铺平道路。
    目前，印度尼西亚进步文学艺术工作者认为，必须学习、领会和运用当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义——毛泽东思想。毛泽东同志明确指出，文学艺术工作者及他们的文学和艺术在文化战线上的任务，在革命之前，是准备舆论和意识形态方面的工作。这个工作要与军事战线上的工作紧密结合起来。总之，在从反动统治者的手里进行夺权的斗争中，笔杆子和枪杆子要相互配合，夺取政权。对于印度尼西亚的文学艺术工作者来说，其任务就是用毛泽东同志关于文艺的思想武装起来，制造舆论和进行意识形态方面的工作。这个工作的迫切任务就是如何使笔杆子变成能“唤起、组织和动员农民”的力量，以便在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的印度尼西亚共产党的领导下，通过武装斗争进行反封建的土地革命。
    为了能够创作这样的作品，就要按照毛主席“必须到群众中去，必须长期地无条件地全心全意地到工农兵群众中去，到火热的斗争中去，到唯一的最广大最丰富的源泉中去，观察、体验、研究、分析一切人，一切阶级，一切群众，一切生动的生活形式和斗争形式，一切文学和艺术的原始材料”的指示去做，投身到群众中去，全心全意地和人民大众相结合。只有通过这条道路，他们才能生动地塑造出工农兵人物形象，才能知道他们无穷无尽的创造力。
    只有遵循毛主席的教导，和群众紧密结合，革命文学艺术工作者的工作才有意义。
    现在，印度尼西亚的革命人民，在马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想武装起来的印度尼西亚共产党的领导下，找到了完成印度尼西亚民族民主革命斗争的新的正确的政治路线，那就是毛泽东思想武装斗争的路线。
    毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》发表已经二十五周年了。在这期间，它已为革命和被压迫人民服务，也是在这期间，亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲以及全世界的文学艺术工作者，特别是中国的文学艺术工作者获得了为人民和革命服务的强大武器。中国的文学和艺术工作者利用这个武器，成功地创作出了划时代的作品。这些作品反映了中国人民在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下的革命斗争，例如：京剧革命现代戏《智取威虎山》、《海港》、《红灯记》、《沙家浜》、《奇袭白虎团》以及革命芭蕾舞剧《红色娘子军》、《白毛女》，交响音乐《沙家浜》和小说《欧阳海之歌》等优秀样板作品。
    印度尼西亚进步文学艺术工作者根据自己的经验认为，要彻底地、正确地贯彻执行毛泽东同志关于文学艺术的教导，必须坚持毛泽东同志所指出的革命道路。只有高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的文学艺术工作者，才能成为全心全意为人民服务的文化战士，其文学和艺术作品，才能成为人民手中争取解放的有力武器。只有在毛泽东思想指导下的文艺作品，才能成为毛主席所说的：“革命文化，对于人民大众，是革命的有力武器。革命文化，在革命前，是革命的思想准备；在革命中，是革命总战线中的一条必要和重要的战线。”印度尼西亚进步文学艺术工作者认为，在反对以美国为首的帝国主义的同时，必须反对其最凶恶的帮凶——以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义。为了彻底打败帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派，特别是以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权为首的印尼反动派，唯一的强有力的武器就是伟大的毛泽东思想。
