	Northeast Agricultural College, Heilongjiang Institute of Technology, Harbin Normal College, and Heilongjiang College of Traditional Chinese Medicine have recently resumed classes and continued the revolution, taking Beijing Institute of Aeronautics as their model.

	After the news of Beijing Institute of Aeronautics resuming classes and continuing the revolution was broadcast, it sparked a strong response among the revolutionary teachers and students in various universities and colleges in Harbin. Revolutionary teachers, students, and staff held discussions, wrote big-character posters, and expressed their determination to learn from the comrades at Beijing Institute of Aeronautics and achieve the resumption of classes and the continuation of the revolution. Northeast Agricultural College, Heilongjiang Institute of Technology, Harbin Normal College, and Heilongjiang College of Traditional Chinese Medicine swiftly mobilized all teachers, students, and staff to discuss and prepare for resuming classes and continuing the revolution. Revolutionary teachers and students unanimously agreed that resuming classes and continuing the revolution is a new battle call issued by the great leader Chairman Mao to revolutionary teachers and students, the major direction of the current struggle in schools, a crucial matter related to whether the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat in universities and colleges can be carried out thoroughly, and an important guarantee for enhancing the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, establishing a new revolutionary order, and implementing Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive. Through mobilizing the masses, using big debates, big-character posters, and big discussions, the schools collectively formulated plans and measures for resuming classes and continuing the revolution. The plans for resuming classes and continuing the revolution in various schools all prioritize the course on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, generally allocating two class periods per day for studying Chairman Mao's works, and making specific arrangements for learning from workers, peasants, and soldiers. The plans for resuming classes and continuing the revolution in various schools also stipulate that in the current phase, the focus should be on criticism, struggle, and reform, gradually transitioning to "learning as the main task, with other tasks combined."

	Northeast Agricultural College and the other three schools have already achieved revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," establishing revolutionary provisional power organs—the Revolutionary Committees. On the day of resuming classes and continuing the revolution, these schools held grand oath-taking rallies.

	Revolutionary teachers, students, and staff in other universities and colleges in Harbin that have not yet resumed classes and continued the revolution are currently actively working on revolutionary unity and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," preparing to achieve the resumption of classes and the continuation of the revolution as soon as possible.

    黑龙江四所高校复课闹革命
    其他大专院校正积极作好复课闹革命的准备
    新华社哈尔滨十三日电　东北农学院、黑龙江工学院、哈尔滨师范学院和黑龙江中医学院四所大专院校，以北京航空学院为榜样，最近相继实现复课闹革命。
    北京航空学院复课闹革命的消息广播以后，在哈尔滨市各大专院校革命师生中引起强烈反响。广大革命师生员工纷纷开座谈会，写大字报，表达他们向北京航空学院战友学习，实现复课闹革命的决心。东北农学院、黑龙江工学院、哈尔滨师范学院和黑龙江中医学院闻风而动，雷厉风行，当即发动全院师生员工就复课闹革命的问题，进行讨论酝酿。广大革命师生一致认为，复课闹革命，是伟大领袖毛主席向革命师生发出的新的战斗号召，是学校当前斗争的大方向，是关系到能不能把大专院校无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的大事，是提高广大革命师生员工的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，建立革命新秩序，贯彻毛主席“五·七”指示的重要保证。各院校通过放手发动群众，采用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论的形式，集中群众智慧，制订了复课闹革命的方案和措施。各院校复课闹革命的方案中，都把学用毛主席著作课，放在首要地位，一般都规定每天以两节课时间学习毛主席著作，对于学工、学农、学军也作了具体安排。各院校的复课闹革命的方案还规定，目前一个阶段，以大批判、斗批改为主，逐步过渡到“以学为主，兼学别样”。
    东北农学院等四院校，都已实现了革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，建立了革命的临时权力机构——革命委员会。在复课闹革命这一天，这些学校都举行了隆重的复课闹革命誓师大会。
    哈尔滨市其他尚未复课闹革命的大专院校的革命师生员工，目前正在积极实行革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，准备尽快实现复课闹革命。
