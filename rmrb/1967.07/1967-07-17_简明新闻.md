	UAR Shoots Down Six Israeli Invading Aircraft
	The UAR military spokesman announced at a press conference in Cairo on the evening of the 15th that the UAR armed forces, in their counterattack against Israeli aggression and air raids, shot down six invading Israeli aircraft on the 15th and destroyed a large number of enemy military equipment, including half-track vehicles and cannons.

	The spokesman said that at 9 a.m. on the 15th, Israeli aggressors shelled the Suez Canal shore towns of Tufik Port, Suez, Ismailia, Qubrit, Fidan, and Kantara with cannons and mortars. Israeli aircraft bombed non-military targets in Tufik Port and Suez City. The enemy's attacks were met with resolute counterattacks by the UAR armed forces.

	U.S. Copper and Rubber Workers Strike
	Over 37,000 copper miners and smelters in 12 states of the United States began a strike late on the 14th to protest against the capitalists' refusal to meet their demand for a wage increase. On the same day, 22,000 workers of a major U.S. rubber company, Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company, also went on strike after labor-management contract negotiations broke down.

	It is reported that four major copper mining companies in the United States have shut down due to the strike. This strike has affected 90% of copper production nationwide.

	De Gaulle and Kissinger Hold Talks in Bonn
	French President Charles de Gaulle and West German Chancellor Henry Kissinger held two days of talks in Bonn on the 12th and 13th. The results of the talks indicate that as the U.S. imperialist power weakens and the U.S. and Soviet rulers push forward their global collusion, the contradictions between France and West Germany with the United States are developing rapidly.

	The West German government spokesman announced to reporters after the talks that both sides emphasized the "special relationship" between the two countries during the talks and expressed a desire to strengthen Franco-German "cooperation"; Kissinger and de Gaulle also agreed to hold "special consultations" in "special situations" in the future.

	Although France and West Germany are mutually utilizing each other in dealing with the United States, there are also many contradictions between them. In this round of talks, they failed to resolve their differences on issues such as Britain's participation in the Western European "Common Market." On the Middle East and Vietnam issues, they also have their own plans and failed to reach a consensus.

    阿联击落以色列入侵飞机六架
    阿联军方发言人十五日晚在开罗举行的记者招待会上宣布，阿联武装部队在反击以色列侵略和空袭中，十五日击落了六架入侵的以色列飞机，击毁了大批敌人的军事装备，包括半履带式车辆和大炮。

    美国铜矿和橡胶工人举行罢工
    美国十二个州的三万七千多名铜矿工人和炼铜工人十四日深夜开始罢工，抗议资本家拒绝他们提出的增加工资的要求。同一天美国一家大橡胶公司——固特异橡胶轮胎公司的两万二千名工人，也在劳资合同谈判破裂后举行罢工。
    据报道，美国四家主要铜矿公司由于工人罢工而关门。这次罢工使得美国全国百分之九十的铜的生产受到了影响。
    戴高乐基辛格在波恩举行会谈
    法国总统戴高乐同西德总理基辛格十二日和十三日在波恩举行两天会谈，会谈结果表明，随着美帝实力日益削弱和美苏统治者加紧推进全球大勾结，法国和西德同美国的矛盾正加速发展。
    西德政府发言人在会谈后向记者宣布，双方会谈中都强调了两国间的“特殊关系”，表示要加强法国—西德“合作”；基辛格和戴高乐还达成协议，今后要在“特殊局势下”进行“专门”协商。
    虽然法国和西德在对付美国方面相互利用，它们之间也存在重重矛盾。在这次会谈中，就没有能消除双方在英国参加西欧“共同市场”等问题上的分歧。双方在中东问题和越南问题上，也各有各的打算，没有能取得一致意见。
