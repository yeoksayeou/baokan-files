Thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, actively promote revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary "triple alliance," and do a good job in the struggle, criticism, and transformation of your unit. These are the major directions of the current struggle. That is, the current big picture.

To achieve revolutionary great unity, we must eliminate the differences between various revolutionary organizations. Based on the successful experiences of some units, to eliminate these differences, we must sit down, engage in democratic discussions, fully consult, and conduct criticism and self-criticism.

To sit down and consult, discuss, we must definitely implement a "forum for all" and not a "single voice." This means we must actively create a democratic atmosphere, create conditions for everyone to speak and finish speaking. Whether the other party speaks the truth or not, we must listen patiently. When speaking, we must first have the desire for unity, seek common ground while reserving differences, and unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought to jointly fight the enemy.

This "forum for all" is particularly important for those in positions of power in revolutionary organizations and revolutionary cadres.

Some people think that the proletarian revolutionary faction is "always correct." They feel that they do not need a "forum for all," just a "single voice" is enough. This way of thinking is wrong.

Chairman Mao has always advocated for a "forum for all" and opposed a "single voice." We revolutionary comrades must not regard ourselves as perfect, must not think that relying on individuals or a few people can accomplish the unprecedented great cause of the Cultural Revolution. "One hero needs three helpers, one fence needs three stakes." Remembering these two idioms is beneficial to us.

Implementing a "forum for all" is indispensable for correctly handling contradictions among the people; it is indispensable for mobilizing all positive factors, uniting all those who can be united, and achieving the broadest revolutionary great unity. On the contrary, if the revolutionary organizations and revolutionary cadres who have taken power implement a "single voice," believing that every "single voice" they speak is the truth, while not believing that there is great truth in the "forum for all" of other revolutionary organizations and revolutionary masses, and ignoring the "forum for all," they will definitely not be able to correctly handle the relationships between various revolutionary organizations and between leaders and the masses. They will not be able to unite more than 95% of the masses and cadres, and they will definitely not be able to grasp the major direction of the struggle.

Our slogan is: We need a "forum for all," not a "single voice"!

    要“群言堂”，不要“一言堂”
    红雨
    彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，积极促进革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，搞好本单位的斗批改，这些是当前斗争的大方向。也就是当前的大局。
    要实现革命的大联合，就要消除各个革命组织之间的分歧。根据一些单位成功的经验，要消除这些分歧，就必须坐下来，民主讨论，充分协商，进行批评和自我批评。
    要坐下来协商，讨论，就一定要实行“群言堂”，不要“一言堂”。这就是说，要主动创造一种民主气氛，创造一种让大家说话，并且把话说完的条件。不论对方说的是正确的话，还是错误的话，都要耐心听下去。在说话的时候，首先要抱有团结的愿望，求大同，存小异，在毛泽东思想的基础上，联合起来，共同对敌。
    这个“群言堂”，对于处在当权地位的革命组织的负责人和革命干部，尤其重要。
    有人认为，无产阶级革命派，是“一贯正确”的。他们觉得不怎么需要“群言堂”，只要“一言堂”就行了。这种想法是不对的。
    毛主席历来提倡“群言堂”，反对“一言堂”。我们革命派的同志，决不要把自己看成是完美无缺的，决不要以为依靠个人，依靠少数人就能把文化大革命这种史无前例的伟大事业办好。“一个好汉也要三个帮，一个篱笆也要三个桩”。记住这两句成语，对我们是有益的。
    实行“群言堂”是正确处理人民内部矛盾必不可少的；是调动一切积极因素，团结一切可以团结的人，实行最广泛的革命大联合必不可少的。相反，当了权的革命组织的负责人和革命干部，如果实行“一言堂”，只相信自己的每“一言”都是真理，而不相信其他革命组织和革命群众的“群言”中大有真理，对“群言”置之不顾，就一定不可能正确处理各个革命组织之间、领导和群众之间的关系，不可能团结百分之九十五以上的群众和干部，也一定不可能掌握好斗争的大方向。
    我们的口号是：要“群言堂”，不要“一言堂”！
