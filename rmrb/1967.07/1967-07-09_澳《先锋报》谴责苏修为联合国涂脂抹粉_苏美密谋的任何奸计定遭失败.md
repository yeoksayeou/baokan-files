Australian "Pioneer" Newspaper Denounces Soviet Revisionists for Whitewashing the United Nations
Soviet-American Conspiracies Will Surely Fail

According to Xinhua News Agency, Melbourne, July 7: The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) organ, "Pioneer," published an article on July 6 denouncing the Soviet revisionist leadership's collusion with U.S. imperialism to use the United Nations as a shield to suppress the struggles of the revolutionary peoples of the world.

The article states: "The Soviet revisionist clique has long been singing praises for the United Nations, attempting to cover up its collusion with U.S. imperialism. The United Nations flag is the flag of U.S. imperialism. The United Nations has never defied the demands of U.S. imperialism. The United Nations' records in Korea, Congo, Kashmir, the Dominican Republic, and Cyprus fully prove this."

The article points out that the United Nations, as a tool for class collaboration, is also very important to the revisionists. The history of invasions under the United Nations' cover is the history of the betrayal by the Soviet revisionist leadership. Every "ceasefire" order issued by the United Nations under the support of the Soviet revisionist clique has only one purpose: to stop the people's struggles and to bail out U.S. imperialism.

The article points out that Kosygin's recent high-profile visit to the United Nations was to try to boost its morale, keep it going, and provide cover for U.S. imperialism. However, the peoples of various countries are increasingly seeing through the United Nations' shield and exposing the ugly face of U.S. imperialism. The article denounces Kosygin's recent visit to the U.S. imperialist head Johnson to plot against the Vietnamese people's struggle for national liberation. The article concludes: "Any scheme plotted by Kosygin and Johnson will surely fail."

　　澳《先锋报》谴责苏修为联合国涂脂抹粉
　　苏美密谋的任何奸计定遭失败
    据新华社墨尔本七日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）机关报《先锋报》六日发表文章，谴责苏联修正主义领导集团勾结美帝，利用联合国这块破招牌，镇压世界革命人民的斗争。
    文章说：“苏修集团早就一直在为联合国唱赞歌，企图掩盖它同美帝的勾结。联合国的旗号，就是美帝国主义的旗号。联合国从来就没有违抗过美帝国主义的要求。联合国在朝鲜、刚果、克什米尔、多米尼加和塞浦路斯问题上的纪录，充分证明了这一点。”
    文章指出，联合国作为搞阶级合作的工具，对于修正主义者也是非常重要的。在联合国掩护下的侵略史，也就是苏联修正主义领导集团叛卖的历史。在苏修集团支持下，联合国发出的每一个“停火”令，都只有一个目的，那就是制止人民的斗争，替美帝国主义解围。
    文章指出，柯西金不久前引人注目地飞往联合国，就是要设法给它打气，把它保持下来，替美帝国主义打掩护。但是，各国人民越来越认清了联合国这块盾牌，识破了美帝国主义的丑恶嘴脸。文章谴责苏修头目柯西金最近专程登门求见美帝国主义头子约翰逊，策划对付越南人民抗美救国斗争的阴谋。文章最后指出：“柯西金和约翰逊密谋策划好的任何奸计，都是一定要失败的。”
