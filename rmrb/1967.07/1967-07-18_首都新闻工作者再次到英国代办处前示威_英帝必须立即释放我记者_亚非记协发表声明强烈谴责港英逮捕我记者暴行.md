Capital journalists once again staged a protest in front of the British Office, demanding the immediate release of our journalist. The Asian-African Journalists Association issued a statement strongly condemning the British colonial authorities' arrest of our journalist.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 17th, the British authorities in Hong Kong once again illegally arrested New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch journalists Chen Fengying and Chen Demu, along with five other patriotic journalists and more than twenty compatriots. This fascist atrocity has sparked even stronger indignation among journalists in the capital. Today, more than 1,500 journalists from the capital gathered again in front of the British Office in China to hold a protest. Chinese journalists have issued a serious warning to the British authorities in Hong Kong: they must immediately release all unjustly detained journalists, publicly apologize for the incident, compensate for all damages, guarantee the reporting freedom of New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch journalists, and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again. Otherwise, the British authorities in Hong Kong must bear all serious consequences that arise from this.

This morning, revolutionary workers from the All-China Journalists Association, People's Daily, Xinhua News Agency, Radio Bureau, PLA Daily, Guangming Daily, Beijing Daily, and other news units in the capital, carried high the portrait of the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and held up banners written in both Chinese and English. They sang songs of Chairman Mao's quotations and marched in a grand procession to the British Office in China to hold a protest. Revolutionary journalists continuously raised their fists and shouted, "Strongly condemn the British authorities' savage persecution of New China News Agency journalists!" "The British imperialists must immediately release our journalists!" "Down with American imperialism!" "Down with British imperialism!" "Down with Soviet modern revisionism!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

Representatives from various news units in the capital handed a protest letter to two British diplomats amid the angry shouts of the protesting crowd. The two diplomats, under the just condemnation of Chinese journalists armed with Mao Zedong Thought, accepted the protest letter in a disgraced manner.

In the protest letter, various news units in the capital solemnly pointed out that the British authorities in Hong Kong attempted to use batons and butcher knives to stop Chinese journalists from exposing their fascist atrocities and to extinguish the surging anti-British and anti-fascist struggle of Hong Kong compatriots with violence. This is a mere pipe dream.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 17th, the Asian-African Journalists Association issued a statement today, strongly condemning the British colonial authorities' savage suppression of Chinese residents and the illegal arrest of Chinese journalists, and demanding the immediate release of these Chinese journalists.

The statement said that the Asian-African Journalists Association Secretariat has been seriously concerned and closely watching the British authorities in Hong Kong's savage fascist suppression of Chinese residents in the Hong Kong and Kowloon regions over the past two months. Many Chinese journalists have been attacked by the British fascist authorities while carrying out normal business activities. We strongly condemn the British authorities' fascist atrocities and demand the immediate release of all illegally detained Chinese journalists. We demand that the British authorities guarantee the freedom of all reporting activities for Chinese journalists in Hong Kong.

The statement expressed that the Asian-African Journalists Association Secretariat fully supports the struggle of Chinese workers, students, businessmen, and residents in the Hong Kong and Kowloon regions against British fascist atrocities. The Chinese residents in Hong Kong and Kowloon have ample reason to oppose the British authorities' fascist suppression measures and to protest and resist the British authorities' assistance to the U.S. Seventh Fleet, making it easier for the United States to invade the Vietnamese people.

The statement emphasized that the past two months of struggle have clearly shown that British fascists, no matter how much force they use, cannot intimidate the Chinese residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon who are armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

    首都新闻工作者再次到英国代办处前示威
    英帝必须立即释放我记者
    亚非记协发表声明强烈谴责港英逮捕我记者暴行
    据新华社十七日讯  香港英国当局又一次非法逮捕新华社香港分社记者陈凤英、陈德穆及其他五名爱国记者和二十多名爱国同胞的法西斯暴行，激起首都新闻工作者更加强烈的愤慨。今天，首都一千五百多名新闻工作者再次涌到英国驻中国代办处门前举行示威。中国新闻工作者严重警告香港英国当局：必须立即全部释放被无理逮捕的记者，并就此事公开道歉，赔偿一切损失，保证新华社香港分社记者的采访自由，保证不再发生类似事件。否则，港英当局必须承担由此引起的一切严重后果。
    今天上午，中华全国新闻工作者协会、人民日报、新华通讯社、广播事业局、解放军报、光明日报、北京日报等首都新闻单位的革命工作人员，高举全世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席像，举着用中文、英文书写的标语，高唱着毛主席语录歌，浩浩荡荡地涌到英国驻中国代办处门前举行抗议示威。革命的新闻工作者不断振臂高呼：“最强烈抗议港英当局野蛮迫害新华社记者！”“英帝国主义必须立即释放中国记者！”“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒英帝国主义！”“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    首都各新闻单位代表，在示威群众的愤怒口号声中，向英国驻中国代办处的两名外交官递交了抗议书。这两名外交官在用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国新闻工作者的正义谴责下，狼狈不堪，乖乖地接受了抗议书。
    首都各新闻单位在抗议书中严正指出，港英当局妄图拿警棍和屠刀来阻止中国记者揭露他们的法西斯暴行，妄想用暴力扑灭香港爱国同胞汹涌澎湃的反英抗暴斗争，这是白日做梦。
    据新华社十七日讯  亚非新闻工作者协会今天发表声明，强烈谴责港英法西斯当局对中国居民的野蛮镇压和非法逮捕中国记者的暴行，并要求立即释放这些中国记者。
    声明说，亚非记协书记处严重地关切并注视着香港英国当局两个多月来对港九地区中国居民所进行的野蛮的法西斯镇压。许多中国记者在从事正常业务活动时遭到英国法西斯当局的袭击。我们强烈谴责港英法西斯当局的暴行，并要求立即释放被非法逮捕的所有中国新闻工作者，要求英国当局保证在香港的中国新闻工作者进行一切报道活动自由。
    声明表示，亚非记协书记处完全支持港九地区的中国工人、学生、商人和居民反对英国法西斯暴行的斗争。港九中国居民有充分的理由反对英国当局的法西斯镇压措施，抗议和反对港英当局帮助美国第七舰队，使美国便于侵略越南人民。
    声明强调说，两个月来的斗争清楚地说明了，英国法西斯主义者使用任何力量，都不能吓倒用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的港九中国居民。
