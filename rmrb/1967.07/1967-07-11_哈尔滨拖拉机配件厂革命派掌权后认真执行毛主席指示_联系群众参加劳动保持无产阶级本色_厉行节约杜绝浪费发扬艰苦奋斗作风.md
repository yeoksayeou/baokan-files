The Revolutionary Committee of the Harbin Tractor Parts Factory has been earnestly implementing Chairman Mao's instruction to "be thrifty and make revolution." They have taken various measures to practice thrift in all aspects, preventing the infiltration of bourgeois ideology. This year, not only have they overfulfilled the state production plan month after month, but they have also saved a large amount of national wealth for the state, further carrying forward the fine tradition of hard struggle and thrift of the proletariat.

They mobilized revolutionary workers to conduct an in-depth criticism of the revisionist line of management pursued by a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in the factory. Workers exposed a large number of facts, denouncing the crimes of this handful of capitalist-roaders who promoted counter-revolutionary economism, flaunted wealth, showed off, and squandered national property. Revolutionary workers throughout the factory further realized that thrift and waste are reflections of the struggle between two classes, two lines, and two roads, and are manifestations of the opposition between the proletarian and bourgeois worldviews. Whether to adhere to hard struggle and thrift or to indulge in waste and show off is a major issue concerning the nature of our regime. A responsible person of the proletarian revolutionary faction in this factory said: "The bourgeois lords have been overthrown, and we proletarian revolutionaries are in power. We must not become rich young masters. We must continue to struggle hard, not detach ourselves from labor, and not detach ourselves from the masses. This is a major matter to prevent 'peaceful evolution.'"

After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power, the first major issue they faced was how to run a socialist enterprise with what kind of style. Previously, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in this factory were aloof, acting as officials and lords in their offices. At the same time, they established a large management apparatus, with too many people and low efficiency. During the Cultural Revolution, the proletarian revolutionary faction united to seize their power, and some workers took up positions as leaders of the factory and workshop revolutionary committees. These comrades, together with the broad masses of workers, made revolution and engaged in production. Later, as more issues needed to be addressed, some comrades suggested: to solve a problem or handle an affair, it is difficult to find the responsible person, so there should be an office, and we also have a place to go. Initially, some comrades accepted this suggestion and set up several special offices in the factory. However, this led to more people coming to the door, and some people were trapped in the office and could not get out, but many problems were not solved. Facing this situation, an old worker spoke with deep concern: "If it is for revolutionary needs, some people can detach themselves from production, but they cannot detach themselves from the masses!" The words of this old worker gave the proletarian revolutionary faction a great enlightenment. They believed that solving problems by sitting in the office was influenced by old ideas and old styles. Problems occur in the workshops and groups, and if one is not familiar with the situation at the grassroots level, one's words will not be effective, and problems will not be solved. They seriously studied Chairman Mao's teaching of "never detaching oneself from the masses for a moment," deciding to make revolution in work clothes, walk out of the office, and return to their own groups to participate in labor. For revolutionary and production issues, they fully followed the mass line, mobilizing everyone to come up with ideas and solutions. In this way, many difficult problems were smoothly solved. To save manpower to the greatest extent and overcome the bureaucratic style of some department staff in the past, the proletarian revolutionary faction in this factory thoroughly smashed the old management system, implemented streamlining and efficiency, and reduced non-production personnel. Now, three-fifths of the original department staff in the entire factory have gone to the workshops to participate in labor; the remaining department staff also insist on participating in half a day of labor every day. This not only improved work efficiency but also strengthened the revolutionary unity among the staff and promoted the thought revolutionization of the department staff.

Not long ago, someone in this factory suggested converting the production car into a broadcast car. The factory's amateur performance troupe also proposed buying new props, new instruments, and new costumes. The Revolutionary Committee believed that the proletarian revolutionary faction should earnestly implement Chairman Mao's instruction to "be thrifty and make revolution," so they first organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's instruction. Through discussion, everyone clearly realized that propagating Mao Zedong Thought is not about who has more loudspeakers or better performance props; it is about who studies and applies Mao Zedong Thought better. To do in-depth and detailed ideological and political work, to infuse Mao Zedong Thought into the masses, this approach can better solve problems and achieve better results. Performing is to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, and to serve the workers, peasants, and soldiers, one must first learn from them. The PLA used tin cans as instruments to perform during times of material scarcity, and we should learn from the PLA. Our conditions are much better, and buying new ones would be a waste. Because of the clarification of thoughts, this factory, which could produce generators and had many large trucks, never equipped a broadcast car. The factory's club and performance troupe did not spend a single cent, solving everything by themselves. This approach was very satisfying to the workers. They also practiced thrift in their actions, using both sides of the paper for writing big-character posters, using unqualified water glass from the glass factory instead of flour to paste big-character posters, saving a large amount of national expenditure.

The proletarian revolutionary faction in this factory, together with the broad revolutionary staff, started from the big picture and entered from the small details, sparing no effort to save raw materials in production. At the beginning of this year, the state allocated a large batch of silicon steel sheets to this factory to manufacture small motors for tractors. They felt that cutting small parts from whole silicon steel sheets was too wasteful, so they actively exchanged whole silicon steel sheets with edge and end materials from sister factories to process small parts, making full use of materials. This not only helped sister factories solve the problem of material shortage but also reduced the cost of products in this factory. In the past five months, they have saved more than ten tons of silicon steel sheets for the state, worth more than 15,000 yuan. Previously, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party did not strive to improve product quality but were keen on surface decoration. They said nonsense like "goods are sold for their packaging," so they used good wood to package products, resulting in great waste. After the proletarian revolutionary faction took power, they followed Chairman Mao's teaching of "practicing thrift" and immediately carried out reforms, changing to packaging with self-made willow baskets. In the past five months, this alone has saved more than 100 cubic meters of wood for the state and reduced the packaging cost of each product by three yuan. Previously, this factory hired outside personnel to load and unload goods every year, spending more than 60,000 yuan on transportation fees. Everyone thought this expenditure could be saved, so the drivers in the factory, with a high sense of responsibility for the revolutionary cause, actively inquired about whether there were any materials of this factory arriving at the station whenever they delivered goods to the railway station. If there were, they would actively find ways to transport them back, trying to avoid running empty. At the same time, they mobilized the labor potential in the factory to form a loading and unloading team, handling everything from the entry of materials to the exit of products. This alone can save more than 50,000 yuan for the state each year.

    哈尔滨拖拉机配件厂革命派掌权后认真执行毛主席指示
    联系群众参加劳动保持无产阶级本色
    厉行节约杜绝浪费发扬艰苦奋斗作风
    本报讯　哈尔滨拖拉机配件厂革命委员会，认真贯彻执行毛主席“要节约闹革命”的指示，采取各种措施，事事处处厉行节约，以防止资产阶级思想的侵蚀。今年以来，不但月月超额完成了国家生产计划，还为国家节约了大量财富，使无产阶级艰苦奋斗的优良传统得到了进一步发扬。
    他们发动革命职工对本厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派推行的修正主义办厂路线，开展了深入的批判。职工们揭发了大量事实，控诉党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派大搞反革命经济主义，讲阔气，摆排场，大肆挥霍浪费国家财产的罪行。全厂革命职工进一步认识到，勤俭节约和铺张浪费，是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的反映，是无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观对立的表现，是艰苦奋斗、勤俭节约，还是铺张浪费、讲排场图阔气，这是关系到我们政权性质的大问题。这个厂的无产阶级革命派负责人说：“资产阶级老爷被打倒了，我们无产阶级革命派当了权，决不能当阔少爷，一定要继续艰苦奋斗，不脱离劳动，不脱离群众。这是防止‘和平演变’的大事。”
    无产阶级革命派当权以后，以什么样的作风来办社会主义企业，这是首先遇到的一个重大问题。过去，这个厂的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，高高在上，在办公室里做官当老爷，同时，还设立了一套庞大的管理机构，人浮于事，办事效能很低。在文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派联合起来夺了他们的权，一些工人担任了厂和车间革命委员会的负责人。这些同志同广大工人群众一起闹革命，共同搞生产。后来要处理的事情多了一些，有的群众就提出：要解决一个问题、办一件事情，找负责人很不好找，应该有个办公室，我们找人也有一个门口啊。开始，有的同志接受了这个意见，在厂部设置了几间专门的办公室。可是这样一来，找上门来的人多了，有的人就陷在办公室里出不去，但很多问题却解决不了。面对这种情况，有的老工人语重心长地说：“如果出于革命的需要，有的人可以脱离生产，但是不能脱离群众啊！”这位老工人的话，给了无产阶级革命派很大的启发。大家认为：光坐在办公室里解决问题是受了旧思想旧作风的影响。问题发生在车间、小组，对基层的情况不明，说话不灵，问题就解决不了。他们认真学习了毛主席“一刻也不脱离群众”的教导，决定要穿着工衣闹革命，走出办公室，回到本小组参加劳动。对于革命和生产中的问题，充分走群众路线，发动大家出主意、想办法。这样，很多困难的问题，就顺利地解决了。为了最大限度地节约人力，克服过去一些科室干部的官僚主义作风，这个厂的无产阶级革命派彻底打碎了过去的一套经营管理制度，实行精兵简政，减少非生产人员。现在全厂原有的科室人员已有三分之二到车间参加劳动；其余的科室人员也坚持每天参加半天劳动。这样不仅提高了办事效能，还加强了职工之间的革命团结，促进了科室人员的思想革命化。
    不久以前，这个厂有人建议把生产车改为广播车。工厂业余演出队也有人提出要买新道具，新乐器，做新服装。厂革委会认为，无产阶级革命派要认真贯彻执行毛主席“要节约闹革命”的指示，就先组织大家学习了毛主席的指示。通过讨论，大家明确认识到：宣传毛泽东思想，不是看谁的高音喇叭多，演出的道具好；而是看谁的毛泽东思想学得好，用得好。要做深入细致的思想政治工作，向群众灌输毛泽东思想，这样做更能解决问题，会收到更好的效果。搞演出是为工农兵服务，为工农兵服务首先要向工农兵学习。解放军在物资缺乏的时候，用罐头盒当乐器也能演出，应该向解放军学习。我们的条件要好得多，再买新的就是浪费了。由于弄清了思想，这个厂本来自己既能生产发电机，又有许多大汽车，但始终没有装一辆广播车。工厂搞俱乐部、演出队，连一分钱也没花，全都靠自己动手解决。这种做法，工人非常满意。他们也在自己的行动上处处厉行节约，写大字报的纸，用完正面再用反面，贴大字报不用面粉做浆糊，而是用玻璃厂不合格的水玻璃代替，为国家节约了大量开支。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派还同广大革命职工一起，从大处着眼，小处入手，千方百计地在生产上节约原材料。今年年初，国家拨给这个厂大批矽钢片，用来制造拖拉机上的小电机。他们感到用整张矽钢片截小件太浪费，就主动地用整张矽钢片同兄弟厂串换边角余料，用来加工小件，做到物尽其用。这样既帮助兄弟厂解决了材料不足的问题，又降低了本厂产品的成本。五个月来，就已为国家节约矽钢片十吨多，价值一万五千多元。过去，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派不是努力提高产品质量，而是热心于装潢表面，他们胡说什么“货卖一张皮”，因此，包装产品全用好木材，浪费很大。无产阶级革命派掌权以后，遵照毛主席“厉行节约”的教导，立即进行了改革，改用自编的柳条筐包装。五个月来，仅这一项就为国家节约木材一百多立方米，并使每件产品的包装费降低了三元。过去，这个厂常年雇用厂外人员装卸货物，每年支出搬运费六万多元。大家认为这笔开支完全可以节省下来，于是厂里的汽车司机发挥对革命事业高度负责的精神，每次送货到火车站，都主动询问有没有本厂进货到站的物资，如果有了就积极想办法运回，尽量做到不跑空车。同时他们还在厂里挖掘劳动潜力组成装卸队，从运进材料到产品出厂，全由自己来干。仅此一项全年可给国家节约五万多元。
