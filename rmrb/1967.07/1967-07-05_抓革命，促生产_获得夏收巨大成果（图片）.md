Revolutionary teachers and students from Shanghai's New Teacher's University, following Chairman Mao's great directive that intellectuals should combine with the workers and peasants, arrived at Jiading County's Malu Commune with fervent political enthusiasm to participate in the summer harvest labor. They mingled with the poor and lower-middle peasants, humbly learning from them.

In the midst of the great victory of the Cultural Revolution, the wheat in Shanxi Province's Jinan Plain has been bountiful. With the support of the People's Liberation Army, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and soldiers together wielded their sickles to harvest.

"Mao Zedong Thought triumphs, the Cultural Revolution bears fruit," Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp the revolution, promote production" has achieved great victories. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in Jiangsu's Hai'an County's Wadian Commune, with joyful hearts, used their boundless enthusiasm to thresh the three kinds of wheat.

The proletarian revolutionary faction of Beijing's Haidian District's Dongbeiwang People's Commune's Hanjiacun Brigade, in the midst of intense class struggle, closely followed Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, continuously achieving victories; in the summer harvest, they again, with a spirit of being the masters, meticulously harvested and threshed, determined to turn over the best grain to the state.
