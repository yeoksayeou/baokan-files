The Vietnamese Government Economic Delegation led by Le Quynh, Vice Premier of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, arrived in Beijing today. Vice Premier Li Xiannian and revolutionary masses from the capital warmly welcomed them at the airport.

New China News Agency, July 20th: "The U.S. imperialists and reactionaries of all countries are paper tigers. The struggle of the Chinese people has proven this. The struggle of the Vietnamese people is proving this." Today, the Red Guards of the capital recited Chairman Mao's teachings loudly at the airport, warmly welcoming the Vietnamese Government Economic Delegation led by Vice Premier Le Quynh of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

At the capital airport, Vice Premier Le Quynh and his delegation were warmly welcomed by Vice Premier Li Xiannian and over a thousand revolutionary masses from the capital.

The deputy leaders of the Vietnamese Government Economic Delegation are Vice Minister of Foreign Trade Li Ban, Ding Deshan, and Vietnamese Ambassador to China Vu Minh Quan.

Today, the flags of China and Vietnam fluttered in the wind at the capital airport. The revolutionary masses and Red Guards of the capital, filled with revolutionary friendship, held high portraits of Chairman Mao and President Ho Chi Minh, singing revolutionary songs, and welcoming the heroic Vietnamese comrades from the frontline of the anti-American struggle. Around 6 PM, the special plane carrying Vice Premier Le Quynh landed amidst the sound of drums. Vice Premier Li Xiannian and others warmly embraced Vice Premier Le Quynh by the plane. A representative of the Red Guards presented the Vietnamese comrades with the "Quotations from Chairman Mao." At this moment, the welcoming revolutionary masses enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live President Ho Chi Minh!"

Vice Premier Li Xiannian accompanied Vice Premier Le Quynh around the airport to meet with the welcoming crowds. The revolutionary masses waved their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," continuously shouting, "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Vietnam will win! The U.S. will be defeated!" Vice Premier Le Quynh frequently waved and greeted the welcoming crowds.

Today, those who went to the airport to welcome the delegation included relevant officials from our country such as Fang Yi, Peng Shaohui, Han Nianlong, Li Qiang, Zhang Xianyue, Ding Xilin, Yang Lin, and Nie Yuanzi.

Those who also went to the airport to welcome the delegation included Deputy Head of the Permanent Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to China, Le Songshan, officials from the Vietnamese Embassy in China, members of the Vietnamese Government Economic Delegation who arrived in Beijing earlier, and representatives of Vietnamese students in Beijing.
