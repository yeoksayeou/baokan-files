	The Ne Win reactionary government is continuing to incite mobsters to hold anti-China "demonstrations" in some small and medium-sized cities in Burma.

	According to a report by the _Guardian_ on the 10th, in Pegu, more than five thousand mobsters held an anti-China "demonstration" on the 9th. In Pyay, Pyinmana, Taungoo, Mawlamyine, Kyaukkyi, Myanaung, and Natmauk, mobsters gathered in groups of two to three thousand to engage in anti-China activities. In these anti-China incidents that occurred in various places, the mobsters shouted anti-China slogans that were obviously issued uniformly by the Ne Win reactionary regime, openly and repeatedly insulting the great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, and the leader of the Burmese Communist Party, Comrade Thakin Than Tun. Under the control of the Ne Win reactionary government, the reactionary newspapers in Burma continued to publish anti-China articles in full force on the 10th, and also published a large number of anti-China pictures, frenziedly inciting anti-China sentiments.

    奈温反动政府继续策动暴徒猖狂反华
    新华社十日讯　仰光消息：奈温反动政府正继续在缅甸的一些中小城镇，策动暴徒举行反华“示威”。
    据《卫报》十日报道，在勃固，有五千多名暴徒九日举行了反华“示威”。在漂贝、凉礼平、东墩枝、马来恩、吉拉、缅拉、那达邻等地，分别有两千到三千以上的暴徒成群结队地进行反华活动。在各地发生的这些反华事件中，暴徒们呼喊着显然是由奈温反动当局统一发布的反华口号，公然一再侮辱中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席和缅甸共产党领导人德钦丹东同志。在奈温反动政府控制下的缅甸反动报纸，十日继续连篇累牍地刊载反华文章，并且刊载了大量反华图片，疯狂地煽动反华情绪。
