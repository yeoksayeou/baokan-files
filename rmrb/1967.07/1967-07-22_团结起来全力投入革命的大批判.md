Editor's Note: The struggle between all revolutionary organizations and revolutionary masses and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is a struggle over major principles concerning the fate of our country. Compared to this major principle, all disagreements among revolutionary mass organizations, including some that are of a principled nature, are minor issues. Minor issues must be subordinate to major principles. If we ignore the major principles and instead focus on internal contradictions among the people, placing them above contradictions between ourselves and the enemy, and cling to minor issues, we will lose sight of the big picture. Minor issues will never be resolved this way; they will only become more entangled. Only by clarifying the major principles and thoroughly criticizing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road can we uproot the fundamental obstacle to great unity. Then, the disagreements among mass organizations can be easily resolved.

The following letter from a reader correctly raises and explains this issue and is worth reading by comrades in all revolutionary organizations. Editor:

In our school, the two revolutionary organizations, Renmin University Red Guard and New People's Commune, had previously engaged in a period of "internal warfare." It has been proven that in most cases, "internal warfare" is akin to "private warfare." For example, on May 7, the Renmin University Red Guard organized a struggle session against the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Zhen and Luo Dianyi. The meeting should have been jointly organized, but due to our Renmin University Red Guard's selfishness, we considered ourselves the old rebels and believed that the New People's Commune did not have the qualifications to be rebels. We refused to cooperate with them. This weakened the force of criticism and struggle and deepened the rift between the two revolutionary organizations. Facts have taught us that "internal warfare" must stop, and our guns must be aimed outward. Otherwise, it will be difficult to carry out the great criticism and great struggle of the revolution.

There are a thousand and ten thousand contradictions among revolutionary organizations, but compared to the contradictions between us and the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, they are of a different nature and are much less important. We often say, "Seek common ground while reserving differences." Completely overthrowing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is the "common ground"; the disagreements among revolutionary organizations are "differences." We have no reason to ignore our common enemy and get bogged down in minor issues. If we are preoccupied with "internal warfare" and regard some minor differences as more important than anything else, we will forget the direction of the struggle. Chairman Mao said, "All minor principles are subject to the major principle." The great criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road is the major principle.

Currently, the two revolutionary organizations in our school have focused on the great criticism of the revolution. Through this criticism, the two revolutionary organizations have gradually united. Recently, the two headquarters have jointly held several struggle sessions, criticizing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. In the great criticism of the revolution, they have begun to reach a consensus on some important issues. For example, regarding the leadership of a certain department, the two organizations previously had differing views. Because they did not focus on the great criticism and ignored the major principles, they were entangled for a long time. Recently, after extensive exposure and criticism, their views on this leader have gradually become consistent. Some classes and departments have even achieved great unity from the bottom up through the great criticism of the revolution. This fully proves that the great criticism of the revolution is a great force for eliminating differences and promoting revolutionary unity.

Many facts show that the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are still alive and well, not dead tigers. They are sharpening their knives, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. If we do not criticize and expose them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, one day these fallen dogs may crawl back to power. Then, no matter whether you are from Renmin University Red Guard or New People's Commune, all revolutionary comrades will be beheaded and drowned in blood.

We revolutionary comrades must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "We must not, because of victory, relax our vigilance against the crazed revenge plots of the imperialists and their running dogs." Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, grasp the great criticism of the revolution, and launch a new wave of great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Let us carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end!

    团结起来全力投入革命的大批判
   编者按：一切革命组织和革命群众同党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派之间的斗争，是关系我们国家命运的大是大非之争。与这个大是大非比较起来，一切革命群众组织之间的分歧，包括一些带原则性的分歧，通通都是小是小非。小是小非必须服从大是大非。如果抛开了大是大非不去争，把人民内部矛盾放在敌我矛盾之上，抓住小是小非不放，这就是丢了大方向，而小是小非也永远不可能得到解决，只会越缠越深。只有大是大非争清楚了，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派批深批透了，这就挖掉了阻碍大联合的总根子，群众组织之间的分歧就能迎刃而解。
    下面的这封读者来信，正确地提出了和说明了这个问题，值得各革命组织的同志们读一读。编辑同志：
    我校人大三红和新人大公社两大革命组织，过去曾经打了一段时间的
  “内战”。事实证明，打“内战”在多数情况下都是打“私”战。例如，五月七日人大三红筹备的一次斗争反革命修正主义分子彭真、陆定一的大会，本来大会应该联合召开，但由于我们人大三红“私”字作怪，以老造反派自居，唯我革命，认为新人大公社不够造反派的资格，拒绝和他们合作。这样做，就大大削弱了批判、斗争的火力，加深了两大革命组织之间的隔阂。事实教育了我们，“内战”必须停止，枪口必须一致对外，否则革命的大批判、大斗争就很难进行。
    革命组织之间有一千个矛盾，一万个矛盾，比起我们跟党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾毕竟是性质不同的很次要的矛盾。我们常说，要“求大同，存小异”。彻底打倒最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派就是“大同”；而革命组织之间的分歧则是“小异”。我们没有半点理由丢开共同的敌人，而在小是小非问题上纠缠不清。如果我们热中于打“内战”，把一些次要的分歧看得比天还大，那就是忘记了斗争大方向。毛主席说：“一切小道理都归大道理管着。”对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判就是最大的道理。
    目前，我校两大革命组织开始抓住了革命大批判这个纲，通过大批判，使两大革命组织逐步联合起来。最近两个总部联合召开了几次斗争大会，共同批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在革命的大批判中开始在一些重要问题上取得了共同语言。例如对一个系的领导干部，过去两大组织的看法有分歧，由于没有抓住大批判这个纲，离开了大是大非，长时期以来纠缠不清。最近通过大揭发、大批判之后，对这个领导干部的看法就逐步取得了一致。有些班系通过革命的大批判，还实现了由下而上的大联合。这就充分证明，革命的大批判是消除分歧、促进革命大联合的伟大动力。
    许多事实说明，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派人还在，心不死，不是死老虎，他们每时每刻都在磨刀霍霍，伺机反扑。如果不把他们从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒、批臭，有朝一日让这些落水狗爬上岸来，我们无产阶级革命派，不管你是人大三红的，还是新人大公社的，都要人头落地，淹没在血泊中。
    我们无产阶级革命派一定要牢记毛主席的教导：“我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性”。让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抓住革命大批判这个纲，掀起对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大揭露、大批判、大斗争的新高潮，将无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
