	In the matter of distribution, there has always been a struggle between two lines. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In the matter of distribution, we must consider the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual." However, the biggest capitalist-roader in power within the Party advocates so-called "four freedoms" and "sell less, keep more," attempting to lead the peasants down the capitalist path, seeking personal "small gains," and making the state "suffer big losses." Now, in the rural revolutionary criticism movement, these fellows' black goods have been thoroughly exposed. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants hate capitalism even more and love socialism even more. After a bumper harvest, they first think of the state, of the people of the entire country and the revolutionary people of the whole world, and of Chairman Mao's teaching of "being prepared for war, prepared for famine, and serving the people." They actively sell grain to support national construction.

	These two teams are excellent examples of correctly handling the matter of distribution.

　　编后
    在分配问题上，从来就存在着两条道路的斗争。毛主席教导我们说：“在分配问题上，我们必须兼顾国家利益、集体利益和个人利益。”但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，却提倡所谓“四大自由”和“少卖多留”，企图把农民引入资本主义歧途，顾个人的“小便宜”，让国家“吃大亏”。现在，在农村的革命大批判中，这些家伙贩卖的黑货被彻底识破了。广大贫下中农更加痛恨资本主义，更加热爱社会主义。丰收以后，他们首先想到国家，想到全国人民和全世界革命人民，想着毛主席“备战、备荒、为人民”的教导，积极交售粮食支援国家建设。
    这两个队就是正确地处理分配问题的好榜样。
