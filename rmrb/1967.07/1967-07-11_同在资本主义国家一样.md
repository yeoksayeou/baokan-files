    Just Like in a Capitalist Country
    Recently, Newi Baoyong, a member of the editorial board of the Japanese newspaper "Mainichi Shimbun," published an article discussing his observations from a visit to the Soviet Union. He wrote:

    While dining in the cafeteria of the Soviet ship "Ulyanovsk," Russian music was continuously played. The music seemed familiar. It turned out to be the Japanese song "Hello, Little Darling." Later, they played the tune "As the evening comes, the sadness is endless..." This clearly has the atmosphere of a "free" country!

    On the train from Nakhodka to Khabarovsk, love songs between men and women were broadcast, making me instantly feel as if I were back in Japan.

    While visiting the Moscow Exhibition of the Achievements of the National Economy, I was looking at the scenery when a young man hurried over and asked me in English, "I want to buy dollars from you." I was startled and stared at the young man's face, saying, "What? Buy dollars?" "Yes! How much do you want? ... How about twice the official exchange rate?" I felt that my assumption that there wouldn't be such people in a socialist country was instantly overturned.

    同在资本主义国家一样
    日本《每日新闻》社论委员新井宝雄不久前发表一篇文章，谈到了他的访苏观感。他写道：
    在苏联“乌利奇号”船餐厅用餐时，船上不停地放送俄罗斯音乐，好象是在哪里听到过的音乐。原来是日本歌曲《你好！小宝贝》。后来又演奏起“黄昏来临，惆怅无限……”的曲子。这分明是“自由”国家的情调啊！
    在从纳霍德卡去哈巴罗夫斯克的火车上，又播送了男女爱情的曲调，使我马上陷入了象在日本本国似的错觉。
    在参观莫斯科国民经济成就展览会时，我正在观望风景的时候，一个青年人急急忙忙地过来，用英语问我：“我是来向您买美元的”。我不由得吃惊地盯住这个青年的面孔说：“啊！买美元？”“对啦！要多少钱给多少钱。……按公开牌价的两倍怎么样”！我感到，我原来认定社会主义国家不会有这样人的假定，一下子就推翻了。
