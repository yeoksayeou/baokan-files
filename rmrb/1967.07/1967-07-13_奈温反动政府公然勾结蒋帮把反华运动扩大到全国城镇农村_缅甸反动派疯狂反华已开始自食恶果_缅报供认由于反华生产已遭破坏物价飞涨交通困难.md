The Ne Win reactionary government, in defiance of the serious warnings from the Chinese government and the Chinese people, as well as the severe condemnation from people all over the world and the people of Burma, is becoming increasingly brazen in pushing its manufactured anti-China, anti-Chinese movement to urban and rural areas across Burma.

Meanwhile, according to reports from Burmese newspapers, an increasing number of KMT (Kuomintang) elements have participated in the anti-China "demonstrations" and rallies organized by the Ne Win reactionary government in recent days in some places. These KMT elements, at the instigation and encouragement of the Burmese reactionaries, have been "invited" to deliver anti-communist, anti-China speeches at anti-China rallies, displaying extreme arrogance. This indicates that the Ne Win reactionary government has openly colluded with the Chiang Kai-shek bandits to oppose the People's Republic of China.

According to reports, by the 10th, ninety towns across Burma had held anti-China "demonstrations" and rallies. On the morning of the 11th, the Ne Win reactionary government organized 500 thugs, under the protection of Burmese military police, to the gate of the Chinese expert team's dormitory at the Swawa plywood factory for serious provocation.

Under the direction of the Ne Win reactionary government, Burmese newspapers have been publishing more anti-China news, articles, and pictures in recent days, inciting anti-China sentiment and opposing the Burmese Communist Party. Some newspapers have openly referred to the atrocities committed by thugs against the Chinese people as "patriotic actions." Some newspapers have even called for the "decision to resolutely eliminate" the patriotic Chinese residents and the Burmese Communist Party in Burma, claiming they are the "main enemies within the country," and advocating the use of martial law to "conduct large-scale arrests." This is obviously an attempt by the Ne Win reactionary government to prepare public opinion for a more extensive and frenzied anti-China, anti-Chinese campaign and the persecution of Burmese revolutionary people. The *Mirror* on the 11th also published an article, shamelessly using the frenzied anti-China activities of the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and the reactionaries of India and Indonesia to boost its own evil deeds.

Some newspapers, while frantically engaging in anti-China activities, have also revealed that the Burmese reactionaries, by instigating this anti-China, anti-Chinese movement, have lifted a rock to drop it on their own feet. They admit that the Ne Win reactionary government's economic sectors have "stopped working, production has been disrupted, transportation is difficult, prices have soared, and schools have been closed." These reactionary newspapers also have to acknowledge that this is "a cause for anxiety and concern."

    奈温反动政府公然勾结蒋帮把反华运动扩大到全国城镇农村
    缅甸反动派疯狂反华已开始自食恶果
    缅报供认由于反华生产已遭破坏物价飞涨交通困难
    新华社十二日讯　仰光消息：不顾中国政府和中国人民的严重警告，以及全世界人民和缅甸人民的严厉谴责，奈温反动政府正愈来愈猖獗地把它一手制造的反华、排华运动，推向缅甸全国城镇和农村。
    同时，据缅甸报纸透露，已有越来越多的蒋帮分子参加了奈温反动政府最近几天在一些地方组织的反华“示威”和集会，这些蒋帮分子在缅甸反动派的怂恿和鼓励下，被“邀请”在反华集会上发表反共、反华“演说”，猖狂已极。这表明，奈温反动政府已经公开同蒋介石匪帮勾结起来，反对中华人民共和国。
    据报道，到十日为止，缅甸全国已有九十个城镇举行反华“示威”和集会。十一日上午，奈温反动政府还组织了五百名暴徒，在缅甸军警的保护下，到斯瓦胶合板厂中国专家组宿舍门前进行严重挑衅。
    在奈温反动政府的指挥下，缅甸报纸这几天以更大的篇幅刊登反华消息、文章和图片，煽动反华，反对缅甸共产党。一些报纸公然把暴徒对中国人民犯下的血腥罪行，称作是“爱国主义”行动。有的报纸公然叫嚣，在缅甸的爱国华侨和缅甸共产党是“缅甸国内的主要敌人”，叫嚷对他们要“坚决取缔”，要“利用军管机会（对他们）进行大围捕”。这显然是奈温反动政府妄图为更大规模地疯狂反华排华和迫害缅甸革命人民作舆论准备。《镜报》十一日还发表文章，恬不知耻地用美帝、苏修和印度、印尼反动派的猖狂反华活动为自己的罪恶勾当鼓气、壮声势。
    一些报纸在拚命反华的同时，也透露了缅甸反动派这次挑起反华排华运动，搬起石头砸自己脚的情况。供认奈温反动政府由于反华排华“经济部门停止了工作，生产遭到破坏，交通运输困难，物价飞涨、学校关闭。”这些反动报纸也不得不承认：这是“令人焦急和担心的”。
