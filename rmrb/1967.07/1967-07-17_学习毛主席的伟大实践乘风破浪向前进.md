We will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

	Xinhua News Agency, July 16th -- Today is the first anniversary of our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao's swim in the Yangtze River. Along the majestic and beautiful rivers, lakes, and seas of our motherland, red flags are flying, and songs are resounding. In the past year, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres, Red Guards, and workers, peasants, and soldiers have advanced victoriously in the class struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. With boundless love and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao, they enthusiastically held celebration meetings and swimming activities. They expressed their immense excitement: Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! We will definitely follow the revolutionary course you have opened up, carry forward the great revolutionary spirit, and bravely advance against the wind and waves. We are determined to learn swimming in swimming, learn struggle in struggle, and achieve revolutionary unity and revolutionary "three-in-one combination" in the great criticism, thoroughly criticize and denounce the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party, and complete the struggle-criticism-transformation of our unit. We will carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

	Today, Beijing is under a clear blue sky. More than 50,000 Red Guards, militia, revolutionary workers, revolutionary teachers, and cadres from various departments held an unprecedented large-scale cross-lake swimming activity in Kunming Lake in the western suburbs and Houhai in the city to celebrate the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's swim in the Yangtze River. On the rippling waters of Kunming Lake and Houhai, countless red flags and large banners with quotations from Chairman Mao and slogans are erected on the water and the shore. The banners read the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings: "Great winds and waves are nothing to be afraid of. Human society has developed through great winds and waves." "The Yangtze River, others say it is very big, but in fact, big is not to be feared. Isn't American imperialism very big? We gave it a push, and it wasn't much. So, some big things in the world are actually not to be feared." In the sky above the water, red balloons carry large banners: "Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!" "Wishing Chairman Mao eternal life!" "Following Chairman Mao in the great winds and waves!" "Proletarian revolutionaries unite!" "Carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" The cross-lake swimming began to the majestic tune of "The East Is Red." The swimming army, surrounded by Chairman Mao's giant portrait and red flags, advanced with high spirits. The Red Guards, who have grown and tempered in the class struggle of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, swim at the forefront of the cross-lake army. The young revolutionaries said, we learn swimming in the rivers, lakes, and seas, and we may drink a few mouthfuls of water. We learn swimming in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and we may also drink a few mouthfuls of water. But under the guidance of the great Mao Zedong Thought, we can learn swimming in swimming and learn struggle in struggle. We will definitely follow Chairman Mao in the great winds and waves.

	Recently, the broad masses of revolutionary cadres in Shanghai and the broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Shanghai held four long-distance swimming activities in the Yangtze River to celebrate the first anniversary of the great leader Chairman Mao's swim in the Yangtze River. More than 2,000 cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army, armed militia, and Red Guards who participated in the long-distance swimming activities in the Yangtze River were selected from tens of thousands of swimming enthusiasts. The Yangtze River is deep and fast-flowing, with strong winds and high waves, but the swimming enthusiasts, some of whom wore gold-plated Chairman Mao badges on their swimming caps and carried the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" on their bodies, bravely advanced against the wind and waves. They said, Chairman Mao badges and "Quotations from Chairman Mao" on the body, warm in the heart, full of strength. No matter how big the wind and waves of the Yangtze River are, we can conquer them.

	Today, the revolutionary cadres and masses of Harbin held a 30-mile and 3-kilometer swimming activity on the Songhua River. Tens of thousands of spectators and swimming enthusiasts repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live Chairman Mao!" They are determined to follow Chairman Mao in the great winds and waves.

	Today, more than 10,000 cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army and revolutionary masses in Jinan, Shandong, crossed the Yellow River and held a celebration meeting on the banks of the Yellow River. The heroes who participated in the Yellow River crossing expressed their determination to follow Chairman Mao closely in the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, break waves and advance bravely, and resolutely overcome all difficulties to achieve a complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

	More than 100,000 proletarian revolutionaries, revolutionary masses, and cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Qingdao held a grand celebration meeting at the Dongfanghong Swimming Ground on the coast to commemorate the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's swim in the Yangtze River. More than 20,000 swimming enthusiasts formed a swimming army and crossed the Huichuan Bay in an orderly and victorious manner.

	Wuhan, Changsha, Fuzhou, Hangzhou, and Kunming also held swimming activities. When 10,000 people crossed the Minjiang River in Fuzhou, they sent a telegram to Chairman Mao, wishing him eternal life! And they promised Chairman Mao that the proletarian revolutionaries in Fuzhou would definitely advance bravely along the revolutionary course opened up by Chairman Mao!

	Xinhua News Agency, July 16th -- The broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army have held grand meetings and swimming activities in recent days to commemorate the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's swim in the Yangtze River. The cadres and fighters expressed their revolutionary enthusiasm and wished the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life. They firmly expressed their determination to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought higher, to carry out a deeper and more extensive revolutionary criticism, to better complete the glorious tasks of "three supports and two militaries" given by Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee, to follow the revolutionary course opened up by Chairman Mao personally, to advance bravely in the great winds and waves, and to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	Our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao swam in the deep and high-waved Yangtze River last year on July 16th. The news spread, and the broad cadres and fighters of the People's Liberation Army were all overjoyed and enthusiastically welcomed Chairman Mao's good health, which is the greatest happiness for the people of the whole country and the world. Today, the broad cadres and fighters commemorate the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's swim in the Yangtze River, recalling the great victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao in the past year, and everyone is overjoyed.

	In Beijing, the revolutionary cultural and sports warriors of the army, navy, and air force, the revolutionary cadres of the air force leadership organs, the revolutionary cadres of the navy direct organs "Red Alliance," and the revolutionary cadres of the General Logistics Department's units in Beijing held grand memorial meetings and cross-lake activities at the "August 1st" Lake in the suburbs of Beijing today and yesterday. The revolutionary cadres of the air force leadership organs and the revolutionary cultural and sports warriors of the three armies stationed in Beijing said at the memorial meeting, one year ago, our red sun, Chairman Mao, personally initiated and led the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution; one year ago today, he swam in the Yangtze River again; and then he issued the great call to us, "You should pay attention to national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end." The broad workers, peasants, and soldiers and revolutionary cadres of all walks of life in our country have responded resolutely to Chairman Mao's great call and, under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, exposed the handful of capitalist-roaders in the Party and achieved great victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Chairman Mao said, "The Yangtze River, others say it is very big, but in fact, big is not to be feared. Isn't American imperialism very big? We gave it a push, and it wasn't much. So, some big things in the world are actually not to be feared." The victories achieved in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution have most powerfully proven that Chairman Mao's teachings are great truths. After the memorial meeting, with the launch of two green signal flares into the sky, team after team of revolutionary warriors jumped into the lake, formed neat rows, and shouted the slogan, "Long live the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao! Long live! Long live! Ten thousand years!" as they swam forward, expressing their determination to advance victoriously forever along the revolutionary course opened up by Chairman Mao.

	The broad cadres and fighters of the stationed troops in Shanghai, Jinan, Qingdao, Heilongjiang, and other places, who have made great contributions in the "three supports and two militaries" work, have also held swimming activities in recent days to commemorate the first anniversary of Chairman Mao's swim in the Yangtze River. The cadres and fighters who participated in the swimming activities said: Of all the rules, studying Chairman Mao's works is the first; of all the important things, studying Chairman Mao's great revolutionary practice is the most important. They firmly expressed their determination to take Chairman Mao's great practice as an example, to go to the great rivers and seas to temper their thoughts, bodies, willpower, perseverance, and wisdom, to cultivate a selfless, fearless, brave, and tenacious fighting style, to follow Chairman Mao in breaking waves all his life, and to do revolution all his life.

	The stationed troops in Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places have also held swimming activities in recent days. The cadres and fighters of the 5th Guard Company of a certain unit of the Shenyang Army held a swimming activity in the rolling waves of the Yellow Sea. The soldiers sincerely wished the great leader Chairman Mao eternal life and firmly expressed their determination to read Chairman Mao's books more diligently, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. In the waves of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, they will temper and transform themselves, excellently complete the glorious tasks of seizing the revolution and promoting preparedness given by Chairman Mao, guard the coastal frontiers of our motherland, and defend the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.
