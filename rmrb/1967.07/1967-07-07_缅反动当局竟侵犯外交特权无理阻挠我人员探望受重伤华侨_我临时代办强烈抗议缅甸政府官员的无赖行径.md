The reactionary Burmese regime has invaded diplomatic privileges and unreasonably obstructed Chinese personnel from visiting severely injured overseas Chinese. The Chinese Chargé d'Affaires strongly protests the shameless behavior of Burmese government officials.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Rangoon on the 6th, the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires in Burma, Xiao Ming, and other embassy staff, on the morning of the 5th, went to the Rangoon General Hospital to visit and comfort overseas Chinese who were severely injured by rioters instigated by the reactionary Burmese government. However, due to the unreasonable obstruction by Burmese foreign ministry officials, who set up one obstacle after another to sabotage the visit, the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires and embassy staff were unable to enter the hospital to meet and comfort the injured overseas Chinese. The Chinese Chargé d'Affaires strongly protested this extremely unreasonable behavior to the Burmese Foreign Ministry.

On the morning of the 5th, the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires, embassy staff, and Xinhua News Agency reporters, accompanied by U Laung, the Director of the First Political Department of the Burmese Foreign Ministry, set off towards the heavily guarded Rangoon General Hospital. Meanwhile, a group of overseas Chinese representatives and relatives of the injured, upon hearing the news that the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires was visiting the hospital, also rushed to the hospital to request a visit with the Chargé d'Affaires. However, U Laung rudely and unreasonably rejected their legitimate and reasonable request. The Chinese Chargé d'Affaires immediately pointed out that the overseas Chinese representatives and relatives' request to visit the injured was completely legitimate and reasonable, and the Burmese side had no right and no reason to interfere. U Laung, unable to find a valid reason, had no choice but to agree to arrange for overseas Chinese representatives and relatives to visit the injured in the hospital later.

However, U Laung came up with another trick, unreasonably limiting the visit to only four embassy staff, with the rest having to wait outside. This unreasonable restriction was met with a stern rebuttal from the Chinese embassy staff. Thus, this "authorized" Burmese foreign ministry official, using the hospital's regulations as an excuse, prohibited embassy staff and Xinhua News Agency reporters from bringing cameras inside. This showed that the Burmese government was very nervous, fearing that its fascist atrocities would be exposed to the world.

When U Laung was making a fool of himself, another Burmese foreign ministry official called him away. After the two whispered to each other, U Laung rushed back to inspect the handbag of a wife of a Chinese embassy diplomatic staff member. This diplomat's wife immediately strongly protested his extremely rude and blatant violation of diplomatic privileges. All the Chinese personnel present angrily rebuked U Laung: "You are extremely rude. Your behavior violates diplomatic customs. You are violating our diplomatic privileges." U Laung turned pale and had no words to respond. At this time, another Burmese official called him away again to whisper. After U Laung returned this time, the Chinese personnel, unable to contain their anger, further questioned U Laung: Are you a diplomat? Do you have any knowledge of diplomatic privileges? Why did you want to inspect the handbag of a diplomat's wife? U Laung, guilty and nervous, weakly said: "I don't want to inspect, I just want to know what's in the handbag." The Chinese personnel retorted: You have no right to know. This is a blatant violation of our diplomatic privileges. We strongly protest your unreasonable behavior again. Under the questioning of the Chinese personnel, U Laung was in a very embarrassing situation. Another Burmese official called him away for the third time to whisper. When U Laung returned this time, he argued: "For safety," nothing can be brought into the hospital. The First Secretary and translator of the Chinese Embassy immediately gave a stern rebuttal. When he was at a loss for words, he shamelessly said: You are not equal to me, you have no right to speak to me. The First Secretary and translator sternly said to him: Since your reactionary government has committed heinous fascist crimes against China and overseas Chinese, every Chinese person has the right to condemn you.

U Laung still insisted that the wife of the Chinese diplomat must leave her handbag outside, otherwise, she would not be allowed in. The Chinese personnel present, pointing to many Burmese people inside the hospital carrying bags, asked him: Since your people can bring bags into the hospital, why can't a diplomat's wife, who enjoys diplomatic privileges, bring a handbag into the hospital? U Laung lied blatantly, saying: They are all hospital staff. At this time, the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires sternly asked him: "You must tell us: How many more obstacles are you setting up in front of us. You can bring them all out. It is obvious that the Burmese government is deliberately doing this, your sinister purpose is to obstruct our embassy personnel from visiting the injured overseas Chinese." At this time, U Laung was in a desperate situation and had to admit: "This is the last one. This is the last one."

Subsequently, the Chinese Chargé d'Affaires Xiao Ming, in front of several hundred Burmese citizens who had gathered around, sternly said to U Laung: "Due to the obstruction of Burmese Foreign Ministry officials, our embassy personnel were unable to see the injured overseas Chinese. This is a premeditated act by the Burmese Foreign Ministry, and we strongly protest this and express our utmost indignation. The Director of the First Political Department of the Burmese Foreign Ministry, U Laung, attempted to search the handbag of a Chinese diplomat's wife, which is a blatant and violent violation of our diplomatic privileges, something the Chinese people cannot tolerate. We strongly protest again."

　　缅反动当局竟侵犯外交特权无理阻挠我人员探望受重伤华侨
　　我临时代办强烈抗议缅甸政府官员的无赖行径
    据新华社仰光六日电　中国驻缅甸大使馆临时代办肖明和大使馆工作人员，五日上午按照缅甸外交部的安排，前往仰光综合医院探望和慰问被缅甸反动政府唆使的暴徒殴打而受重伤的华侨。但是由于缅甸外交部官员无理阻挠，设置了一个又一个的障碍来破坏这次探望，中国代办和大使馆工作人员未能进入医院去会见和慰问受伤的华侨。中国临时代办就这种极其无理的行为，向缅甸外交部提出了最强烈的抗议。
    五日上午十一时，中国临时代办、大使馆工作人员和新华社记者，由缅甸外交部第一政治司司长吴拉昂陪同，动身前往警卫森严的仰光综合医院。与此同时，一批华侨代表和受伤者亲属听到中国临时代办赴院探望的消息，也赶到医院要求同临时代办一起探望受伤的人。但是，吴拉昂粗暴无理地拒绝了他们的正当合理要求。中国临时代办当即指出，华侨代表和亲属要求探望受伤者是完全正当合理的，缅方没有任何权利，也没有任何理由加以干涉。吴拉昂找不到什么站得住脚的理由，只好同意以后为华侨代表和受伤者亲属到医院探望作出安排。
    但是，吴拉昂又抛出了一个鬼花招，无理限定只许四名大使馆人员进入医院，其他人只能在外面等着。这一毫无理由的限制遭到了中国大使馆人员严正的驳斥。于是缅甸外交部的这个“受权的官员”又以缅甸医院的规章为借口，禁止大使馆人员和新华社记者带照相机进去。这表明，缅甸政府心虚得很，深怕它的法西斯暴行被公诸于世。
    当吴拉昂正在丑态百出的时候，缅甸外交部的另一个官员把他叫走了。两人耳语了一阵之后，吴拉昂跑回来要检查一个中国大使馆外交人员的夫人的手提包。这位外交人员的夫人马上对他的这种极端无礼的和公然侵犯外交特权的行为提出最强烈的抗议。全体在场的中国人员愤怒地训斥吴拉昂：“你无礼极了。你的举止违反外交惯例。你侵犯了我们的外交特权。”吴拉昂脸色发白，无言对答。这时，缅甸外交部的另一个官员又把他叫过去叽咕了一阵。随后吴拉昂又回来了。在场的中国人员抑止不住胸中怒火，进一步质问吴拉昂是不是外交官员？他有没有一点外交特权的常识？他为什么竟然要检查外交人员的夫人的手提包？吴拉昂理亏心虚，有气无力地说：“我不想检查，我只想知道手提包里头装的是什么。”中国人员又驳斥他说：你没有权利知道。这是明目张胆地侵犯我们的外交特权。我们对你们的无理行为再次提出最强烈的抗议。在中国人员的责问下，吴拉昂陷入了十分尴尬的境地。另一个缅甸官员第三次把他叫过去窃窃私语。当吴拉昂这一次回来时，他争辩说：“为了安全”，什么东西都不得带进医院。中国大使馆一等秘书和翻译立即予以严厉驳斥。当他理屈词穷时，他竟然大耍无赖说：你同我不对等，你没有权利对我说话。大使馆一等秘书和翻译义正词严地对他说：既然你们的反动政府对中国和华侨犯下了滔天的法西斯罪行，每一个中国人都有权利谴责你。
    吴拉昂仍然坚持要那位中国外交人员的夫人把手提包留下来，否则就不让她进去。在场的中国人员指着医院里许多拿着提包的缅甸人，质问他说：既然你们的人都可以带提包进医院，为什么享有外交特权的一位外交人员的夫人却不能带一只手提包进医院呢？吴拉昂大扯其谎，胡说什么：他们都是医院里的工作人员。这时，中国临时代办严正地质问他：“你必须告诉我们：你在我们面前设置的障碍还有多少。你可以统统摆出来。很明显，缅甸政府是故意这样干的，你们的阴险目的是企图阻挠我大使馆人员探望受伤的华侨。”这时，吴拉昂狼狈万状，不得不招认说：“这是最后一个。这是最后一个。”
    随后，中国大使馆临时代办肖明当着围拢来的几百名缅甸公民，严厉地对吴拉昂说：“由于缅甸外交部官员的百般阻挠，我大使馆人员无法见到受伤华侨。这是缅甸外交部预谋的，我们对此提出最强烈抗议，并表示最大的愤慨。缅甸外交部第一政治司司长吴拉昂企图搜查中国外交人员的夫人的手提包，这是对我外交特权的明目张胆的粗暴的破坏，这是中国人民决不能容忍的。我们再次提出最强烈的抗议。”
