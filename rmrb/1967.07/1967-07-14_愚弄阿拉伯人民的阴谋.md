The Soviet revisionist clique has recently committed another act of betrayal against the Arab people.

During the discussions on the Middle East issue at the Security Council, the Soviet revisionists did not even mention condemning Israel or demanding that Israel withdraw its troops. Instead, they hurriedly collaborated with U.S. imperialism to authorize the United Nations to send so-called "ceasefire observers" to the Middle East. This action is actually aimed at solidifying the fait accompli of Israel's occupation of Arab territories, thereby depriving Arab countries of their right to recover their lost lands. What else is this if not a further betrayal of the Arab people?

The tricks played by the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialism are all too familiar to people. First, they send so-called "ceasefire observers," and then they send so-called "United Nations forces." Through these means, imperialist forces of aggression can return to the Suez Canal, and the Soviet revisionist clique also hopes to get a share of the spoils. The Soviet revisionist traitors have completely degenerated into accomplices of U.S.-British neocolonialism.

To cover up this grand conspiracy of aggression, the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin went so far as to spread smoke screens. In answering questions from French radio and television reporters, he shouted that the Soviet revisionists have "confidence in the United Nations" and that the United Nations will eventually pass a resolution condemning Israel's aggression and demanding that it withdraw from the territories it has occupied.

Kosygin is issuing such empty promises now, merely to continue deceiving the Arab people. The Soviet revisionist clique intends to use the chains of the United Nations to tightly bind the Arab countries, in order to realize their conspiracy of aggression planned in collusion with the United States.

Since Israel's aggression against the Arab countries, the Soviet revisionist clique has repeatedly betrayed the interests of the Arab people, collaborating with U.S. imperialism to stage a fraudulent cooperation act on the stage of the United Nations. On the issue of whether to condemn Israel and demand that Israel withdraw its troops, they have been singing and dancing endlessly. This farce is sometimes moved from the Security Council to the United Nations General Assembly, and sometimes back from the United Nations General Assembly to the Security Council. You have been putting on this shoddy show for a whole month, threatening and deceiving the Arab people, making the Israeli aggressors even more arrogant because of the protection they have received. The Arab countries have had enough of your tricks. Now you want to use castles in the air to lull the Arab people, preparing to manipulate their fate together with imperialism. Your hearts are truly vicious.

Chairman Mao has pointed out: "Imperialism and reactionaries always cooperate in one respect, that is, they use various methods to try to destroy revolutionary forces and preserve reactionary forces. They will use various methods: open and secret, direct and indirect."

The Soviet revisionist clique is precisely collaborating with U.S.-British imperialism, attempting to use the United Nations, this tool of aggression, to carve up the Arab people. But all your conspiracies are bound to fail. The public opinion of Arab countries has strongly condemned the criminal acts of the United States and the Soviet revisionists in manipulating the United Nations, and has issued the roar: "The Arab people cannot rely on the United Nations." The Soviet revisionist clique's wanton actions can only more thoroughly expose your traitorous face of false support and true betrayal to the Arab people, and in the end, you will be thoroughly spat upon by the Arab people and the people of the world.

### 愚弄阿拉伯人民的阴谋

    愚弄阿拉伯人民的阴谋
    苏修集团最近又干出一桩出卖阿拉伯人民的坏事。
    在安理会讨论中东问题时，苏修集团根本不提谴责以色列，不提要求以色列撤军，而是急忙伙同美帝决定授权联合国向中东派驻所谓“停战观察员”。这样做，实际上就是要把以色列侵占阿拉伯国家领土的既成事实固定下来，从而剥夺了阿拉伯国家收复失地的权利。这不是对阿拉伯人民的进一步叛卖又是什么呢？
    苏修和美帝的这一套把戏，人们是十分熟悉的。先是派所谓“停战观察员”，然后就是派所谓“联合国部队”。通过这种途径，帝国主义的侵略势力就可以重返苏伊士运河，而苏修集团也希望从中分一杯羹。苏修叛徒们已经完全堕落成为美英新殖民主义的同谋者了。
    为了给这一个侵略大阴谋打掩护，苏修头目柯西金竟然大放烟幕。他在回答法国电台和电视台记者的问题时，叫嚷苏修对联合国“怀有信心”，并且说什么：“联合国迟早要通过关于谴责以色列侵略和从他们霸占的领土上撤军的决定”。
    柯西金现在滥开这种空头支票，无非想要继续愚弄阿拉伯人民。苏修集团企图用联合国的锁链，牢牢地把阿拉伯国家拴住，以便实现他们美苏合伙策划的这一侵略阴谋。
    自从以色列侵略阿拉伯国家以来，苏修集团一而再、再而三地出卖阿拉伯人民的利益，伙同美帝国主义利用联合国的舞台串演骗人的合作戏，在是否谴责以色列和要求以色列撤军的问题上说说唱唱，没完没了。这出蹩脚戏一会儿从安理会搬到联合国大会，一会儿又从联合国大会搬回到安理会。你们装模作样地足足闹了个把月，对阿拉伯人民威胁与欺骗兼施，使得以色列侵略者由于得到庇护而气焰更加嚣张。阿拉伯国家算是吃够了你们的苦头了。现在你们又想用空中楼阁来麻痹阿拉伯人民，准备同帝国主义一起来摆布他们的命运。你们的心肠实在太狠毒了。
    毛主席曾经指出：帝国主义和反动派在有一点上总是会互相合作，“这就是用各种方法力图破坏革命势力而保存反动势力。他们将要用各种方法：公开的和秘密的，直接的和迂回的。”
    苏修集团同美英帝国主义正是在进行通力合作，妄图利用联合国这个侵略工具来宰割阿拉伯人民。但是，你们的一切阴谋都肯定是要破产的。阿拉伯国家的舆论纷纷对美帝苏修操纵联合国的罪恶行径提出强烈的谴责，发出了“阿拉伯人民不能依靠联合国”的怒吼。苏修集团这样胡作非为，只能更彻底地暴露你们对阿拉伯人民假支持真出卖的叛徒面目，到头来必将遭到阿拉伯人民和全世界人民的彻底唾弃。
