Hong Kong seamen take sanction actions to severely strike back at the British Empire
Seamen's union issues a letter to seamen announcing refusal to transport goods in and out of Hong Kong

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong on the 17th, the Hong Kong Seamen's Union Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee issued a "Letter to Chinese Seamen" in the early hours of the 17th. The letter decided that from that day onwards, all seamen in Hong Kong would immediately take action to refuse transporting goods in and out of Hong Kong, causing Hong Kong's import and export transportation to completely halt, and severely striking back at the evil British colonial authorities.

	The "Letter to Chinese Seamen" stated that since May, the evil British colonial authorities, despite multiple serious warnings from the Chinese government, have continuously carried out bloody suppression in Hong Kong. Up to now, over 2,000 compatriots have been arrested, countless have been injured, and it has been confirmed that more than ten have been beaten to death. Over a thousand have been subjected to illegal trials, illegal sentencing, and imprisoned. The atrocities of the British fascists are appalling.

	The "Letter to Chinese Seamen" stated that British imperialism is the sworn enemy of the 700 million Chinese people and all patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. For over a hundred years, it has occupied Hong Kong, annexed Kowloon, and seized the New Territories, subjecting our compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon to brutal colonial oppression and exploitation. Its crimes are heinous. It has closed the Hong Kong Seamen's Union three times, created the most unreasonable maritime regulations, persecuted and exploited seamen, and last year, it ruthlessly established the "Seamen Recruitment Office" to restrict seamen's employment and strengthen political control over seamen. Its crimes are countless.

	The "Letter to Chinese Seamen" stated that now, this evil enemy is arresting and killing us. Can the Chinese people who have stood up tolerate this? No, absolutely not. To thoroughly defeat the British in Hong Kong, to maintain the dignity of the Chinese nation, and to defeat the "Seamen Recruitment Office" and fight for employment rights, we call on all seamen in Hong Kong to immediately take action, join the battle, refuse to transport goods in and out of Hong Kong, sanction the British, and join hands with the striking port workers to completely halt Hong Kong's import and export transportation, and put the evil British rulers to death.

	The "Letter to Chinese Seamen" proposed:

	1. From now on, seamen on all ships will refuse to transport goods in and out of Hong Kong. If a ship arrives in Hong Kong to load or unload goods, the seamen will immediately go on strike and take sanction actions. Seamen on all ships arriving in Hong Kong should immediately contact the union.

	2. Seamen on overseas voyages should immediately stop the shipowners and companies from loading Hong Kong import and export goods, and declare that if goods are loaded or unloaded in Hong Kong, they will be subject to strike sanctions.

	3. Ships arriving in port will not load or unload goods, but will only exchange crew members, and will not be subject to strike sanctions.

	4. All unemployed seamen will not work on ships of striking workers, nor will they do substitute work. Unemployed seamen should immediately register and report to the union.

	The "Letter to Chinese Seamen" called on Hong Kong seamen to mobilize and organize, resolutely carry out sanction actions, and strive to gain the support and participation of foreign seamen brothers on the same ship in our sanction actions.

	The "Letter to Chinese Seamen" finally emphasized: We have the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and we have a great motherland to rely on. Victory will definitely be ours. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, "With firm determination, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." Carry out the sanction struggle to the end, and do not rest until we achieve complete victory. The British will either surrender or be destroyed!

    香港海员采取制裁行动狠狠打击英帝
    海员工会发表告海员书宣布拒绝运输货物进出香港
    据新华社香港十七日电　香港海员工会反对港英迫害斗争委员会十七日凌晨发表《告中国海员书》，决定从即日开始，全港海员立即行动起来、拒绝运输货物进出香港，使香港出入口运输彻底瘫痪，狠狠打击万恶的港英法西斯当局。
    《告中国海员书》说，自五月以来，万恶的港英殖民当局，不顾我国政府的多次严重警告，不断在香港制造血腥镇压暴行。到现在为止，已逮捕我同胞超过二千人，打伤无数，其中已查明被打死者十余人，被非法审讯、非法判刑，并投进监狱的有一千多人。港英法西斯暴行，令人发指。
    《告中国海员书》说，英帝国主义是七亿中国人民和全港九爱国同胞的死敌，一百多年来，它霸占香港，侵吞九龙，攫取新界，对我港九同胞进行残酷的殖民压迫和剥削，罪恶滔天。它曾三次封闭我香港海员工会，制造最不合理的海事法例，迫害和剥削海员，去年更横蛮地设立“海员招募处”，限制海员就业，从政治上加强对海员的控制。其滔天罪行，罄竹难书。
    《告中国海员书》说，现在，这个万恶的敌人，正对我们捕打枪杀，站了起来的中国人民能容忍吗？不能，一万个不能。为了彻底斗垮港英，维护中华民族的尊严，也为了斗垮“海员招募处”，争取就业权利，我们号召全港海员立即行动起来，投入战斗，拒绝运输货物进出香港，制裁港英，与港口罢工工人相携手，彻底使香港出入口运输瘫痪，把万恶的港英统治者置于死地。
    《告中国海员书》提出：
    一、各轮海员即日起，拒绝运输货物进出香港，如船到香港起落货物，当即罢工制裁。各轮海员到港后，即到工会联系。
    二、在海外航行的海员，要立即制止船主和公司接载香港出入口货物，并声明，如在港起落货物，将会受到罢工制裁。
    三、轮船到港，不起落货物，只调换船员，不作罢工制裁。
    四、所有失业海员，不到罢工工人的船上工作，也不做替工。失业海员即到工会登记报到。
    《告中国海员书》要求香港海员动员起来，组织起来，坚决执行制裁行动。争取同船的外国海员兄弟，支持和参加我们的制裁行动。
    《告中国海员书》最后强调说：我们有战无不胜的毛泽东思想，有伟大的祖国做靠山，胜利一定属于我们，让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”把制裁斗争进行到底，不获全胜，誓不罢休，港英不投降，就要它灭亡！
