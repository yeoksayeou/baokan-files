Chairman Mao, it was you who ignited the flames of armed struggle in the dark old China. It was you who led us through one storm after another, guiding the Chinese revolution forward, ever forward.

	(1933, Chairman Mao at the Poor Farmers' Association Representatives' Conference in eight counties of Jiangxi and Fujian)

Chairman Mao, you strive for the people's happiness. You are our great savior. You love the masses most, always sharing their breaths and destinies. You have set the most brilliant example for the entire Party. You are forever in our hearts, and we will forever follow you in revolution.

	(Chairman Mao conversing with farmers in Yan'an Yangjialing)

Chairman Mao, the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China is your creation, armed with your brilliant thoughts. At every critical juncture of the revolution, it is you who clear the fog, correct our course, and point out the direction of struggle. We will advance bravely on the course you have opened!

	(1945, Chairman Mao delivering the political report "On the Coalition Government" at the Seventh National Congress of the Communist Party of China)

Chairman Mao, you are our great teacher. Comrade Lin Biao is your close comrade and best student. At every critical juncture of the revolution, Comrade Lin Biao has stood firmly by your side, resolutely fighting against all "left" and right erroneous lines, and bravely defending Mao Zedong Thought. We will take Comrade Lin Biao as our example, forever loyal to you, forever loyal to your great thoughts.

	(Chairman Mao with Comrade Lin Biao)

Chairman Mao, it is you, the genius helmsman, who have guided us from one victory to another. It is you who solemnly proclaimed the birth of the new China of proletarian dictatorship from Tiananmen.

	(October 1, 1949, Chairman Mao proclaiming the founding of the People's Republic of China from Tiananmen)

Chairman Mao, your words are the highest in standard and the greatest in power, every sentence is truth, one sentence is worth ten thousand. Your brilliant works are the lifeblood of the revolutionary people. We will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Let the brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought shine over the entire country, shine over the whole world!

	(1946, Chairman Mao writing in Yan'an)

Chairman Mao, you are the most outstanding leader of the proletariat. You have personally directed so many major political and military campaigns on the front lines. You have experienced the most complex, intense, prolonged, and arduous struggles in all aspects. Your thoughts and revolutionary practices have shown your great proletarian genius.

	(Chairman Mao in the suburbs of Yan'an)

Chairman Mao, Chairman Mao! The red sun in our hearts, it is you who personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, ensuring that the socialist mountains will never change color for ten thousand generations. It is you who have opened a new era of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, personally writing the most brilliant chapter in the history of the international communist movement! We wish you a million years of life, a million years of life!

	(1966, Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, and Premier Zhou reviewing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution Army on Tiananmen)
