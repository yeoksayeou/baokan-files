From a political and ideological standpoint, we must thoroughly defeat the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. This is a glorious historical task and a serious combat mission that lies before the entire Party, the entire military, and the people of the entire nation.

This unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution is a revolution that touches the soul. It is a broad, mass-based ideological revolution, a great revolutionary movement to smash bourgeois ideology and establish proletarian ideology.

Over the course of a year of cultural revolution, we have already exposed the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, pulled them off their horses, and made them stand aside. This is the most important achievement of the proletarian cultural revolution. However, as the article by Red Spearpoints out, merely seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party organizationally is only the beginning of the struggle for power, not the end. In other words, merely defeating them organizationally is far from enough; we must also defeat them politically, ideologically, and theoretically through a great criticism, exposure, and struggle, and conduct a thorough cleanup of these piles of rotting garbage.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful." The handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party are also paper tigers. Their roots in political ideology run deep. Without thorough criticism, their poison cannot be eradicated. If we are not careful, there is always the possibility of a restoration. Therefore, we revolutionary cadres of the proletariat must never relax our fighting spirit and must never "lie in bed, thinking that a great wind will blow away all the dust."

The most powerful weapon in this great criticism is the invincible great thought of Mao Zedong. We must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the great criticism, learning as we fight. While smashing bourgeois ideology, we must establish the thought of Mao Zedong, and bloom brilliant flowers on the ideological and theoretical front.

All revolutionary cadres of the proletariat, unite and combine forces to complete this glorious task entrusted to us by history!

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are aimed at seizing power, consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for the purpose of maintaining their power." The proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, fundamentally aims to mobilize hundreds of millions of people to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. This is the direction of the struggle in this movement. The revolutionary cadres of the proletariat in the leadership of our air force, following the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, have always directed the spearhead of our struggle against the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the military, with China's Khrushchev as their representative, and against the reactionary command of the bourgeoisie, completely smashing them.

The handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party are the most dangerous and principal enemies. They have infiltrated the organs of proletarian power, established organs of bourgeois dictatorship, and thus created a situation of intense struggle between two powers and two commands. Of course, in terms of our entire country, it is the proletarian power that is in the dominant position. The organs of bourgeois dictatorship established by the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, who have usurped leadership, are only in certain parts and aspects. However, if we allow them to exist and develop, "it will not take much time, a few years or a dozen years at the least, several dozen years at the most, before an inevitable nationwide counter-revolutionary restoration occurs. The Marxist-Leninist Party will definitely become a revisionist party, become a fascist party, and the whole of China will change color." Therefore, we must, through the proletarian cultural revolution, thoroughly smash the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, with China's Khrushchev as their representative, and thoroughly smash their bourgeois command. This is an extremely complex, profound, and intense struggle between two classes, two roads, and two lines.

Chairman Mao says: "The socialist system has been basically established in our country. We have basically won the victory in the transformation of the ownership of the means of production, but on the political and ideological fronts, we have not yet completely won the victory. The question of who will win between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological sphere has not been truly resolved. We must continue the long-term struggle against bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideology." Our struggle with the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party for power cannot but be strongly reflected on the political and ideological fronts. Exposing the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party from the organs of proletarian power, removing their positions, and dismissing them from office is only the beginning of the struggle for power, not the end. "It is better to pursue the enemy to the end, do not seek fame by learning from the example of Xiang Yu." To expand the organizational victory to a thorough political and ideological victory, we must continue to fight a hard struggle. Chairman Mao teaches: "We must never relax our vigilance against the crazed plots of revenge by the imperialist elements and their running dogs because of victory, otherwise we will be disarmed politically and put in a passive position." Comrade Lin Biao points out that the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, though few in number, have great political energy, and their resistance is much greater than their numerical proportion. Countless facts also tell us that defeating the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party organizationally does not mean defeating them politically and ideologically, dismissing them from office does not mean completely seizing power, and seizing power is not simply dismissing them from office. Position and power are connected, but they are not entirely the same thing. Having a position certainly means having power, but not having a position may still mean having power.

What does having power mean? Having power not only means having organizational and administrative command, but also means having political and ideological command. Having influence in politics and among the masses means that people will follow their commands, and at a certain time, it will turn into organizational and administrative command.

The handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party's political and ideological power mainly lies in their influence among the masses. This is the result of their using their positions to wave the red flag to oppose the red flag, deceiving the masses, and is also the result of their long-term use of propaganda organs, pens, and the ideological and educational positions they have stolen to create counter-revolutionary public opinion among the masses. This political and ideological power cannot be stripped away by organizational means such as dismissing them from office from top to bottom; it must be stripped away through a broad, mass-based movement of exposure and criticism from bottom to top, thoroughly exposing, criticizing, and overthrowing the crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, with China's Khrushchev as their representative, against the Party, against socialism, and against the thought of Mao Zedong, and thoroughly purging their poison and influence among the masses, so that they can no longer deceive the masses.

Defeating them organizationally and defeating them politically and ideologically, seizing power organizationally and seizing power politically and ideologically, are two inseparable aspects of seizing power from the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. Relatively speaking, the latter is more complex and important than the former. If we merely defeat the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party organizationally and seize their power organizationally, without further defeating them politically and ideologically and seizing their power politically and ideologically, this is not a thorough defeat, not a thorough seizure of power. Moreover, without a thorough political and ideological victory as a guarantee, the organizational victory will not be consolidated and may be overturned at any time; because the organization is established by people and is controlled by people's thoughts and will. "If things are not handled properly, the restoration of capitalism may be imminent." Under the leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, we revolutionary cadres of the proletariat not only have the resolve and strength to defeat the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party organizationally and seize their power organizationally, but also have the resolve and strength to defeat them politically and ideologically and seize their power politically and ideologically, so that they can never rise again. The handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party's "political capital" is stolen, and in this respect, they are also "paper tigers," because their plot to restore capitalism goes against the laws of historical development.

Thoroughly criticizing the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party politically and ideologically is the key to preventing our country from changing color. Only in this way can we prevent them from rising again; and make our revolutionary masses vigilant against new capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, if they appear, quickly recognize their true faces, and resolutely defeat them. Therefore, we must not only fiercely fight the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, thoroughly defeating them in both person and thought, and thoroughly burying the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party's backstage manipulator and representative organizationally, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, but also thoroughly uproot the social ideological foundation of counter-revolutionary revisionism and achieve a thorough victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will never willingly accept their defeat. They will make their last struggle. The representatives of all exploiting classes, when they are in an unfavorable situation, in order to protect their current existence and future development, often adopt the strategy of attacking to defend themselves. ... In short, they are always studying strategies to counter us, 'observing the direction,' in order to succeed. Sometimes they will 'pretend to be dead and lie down,' waiting for the opportunity to 'counterattack.' Therefore, before and after we expose the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, we must always direct the spearhead of our struggle against them. Some people say this is fighting a 'dead tiger,' wasting ammunition. They think that only exposing 'live tigers' is the focus of the movement, can achieve merit, and is in line with the direction of the struggle. This view is wrong. We believe that the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, like all class enemies, will not easily retreat from the historical stage and will not willingly perish. 'The big snakes and small snakes, black snakes and white snakes, snakes showing their poisonous fangs and snakes turning into beautiful women that occupy most of China's land, although they have felt the threat of winter, are not yet frozen stiff!'"

Some of them are "dead" organizationally but not politically and ideologically, and are not "dead tigers," they are "injured tigers," some are "pretending to be dead tigers," "faking death tigers"; and some are not even "dead" organizationally and are still biting people. Those "tigers" who have been exposed but not truly killed are even more hateful towards Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and revolutionary masses, not only plotting to "settle accounts in autumn" and "avenge in ten years," but also in the current movement, they are always using their political and ideological influence to counterattack, directly or indirectly using various means to sabotage the proletarian cultural revolution. Their struggle is more frantic and more vicious. If we do not kill the "injured tigers," "pretending to be dead tigers," "faking death tigers," and "tigers" that are not even "dead" organizationally, and make them never rise again, we will be eaten by the tigers, and the proletarian cultural revolution will be in vain, just as Chairman Mao pointed out: "Either kill the tiger or be eaten by the tiger, one of the two must happen."

"From a fundamental point of view, from a long-term point of view, from a strategic point of view, we must realistically regard imperialism and all reactionaries as paper tigers. On this basis, we establish our strategic thinking. On the other hand, they are also real, iron, and living tigers that eat people. On this basis, we establish our tactical and strategic thinking." To thoroughly defeat the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party, we must achieve and consolidate the great unity of the revolution, launch a magnificent people's war, adopt various forms of struggle and flexible and mobile strategies and tactics, and engage in a repeated struggle with the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party over every inch of power and every inch of land. Strategically, we dare to despise them; tactically, we take them seriously; strategically, we have the resolve to fight a protracted war; tactically, we have the means to fight a decisive battle.

To thoroughly defeat the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the military, with China's Khrushchev as their representative, and thoroughly smash their bourgeois command, we must rely on the great, invincible thought of Mao Zedong, rely on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, rely on the revolutionary masses armed with the thought of Mao Zedong, and rely on the proletarian power established under the leadership of Chairman Mao. Therefore, we must always emphasize studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle, establishing the supreme authority of the thought of Mao Zedong in the struggle, tempering the revolutionary class ranks in the struggle, and strengthening the proletarian dictatorship in the struggle. This is the fundamental guarantee for achieving a thorough victory in the proletarian cultural revolution.

    从政治上思想上彻底打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派
    空军司令部　红尖兵
    编者按：红尖兵的文章，向我们提出了一个很重要的问题，就是不但要从组织上而且要从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。这是摆在我们全党、全军和全国人民面前的一项光荣的历史任务，一项严重的战斗任务。
    这次史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命，是一场触及人们灵魂的大革命。这是一场广泛的群众性的思想革命运动，是大破资产阶级思想、大立无产阶级思想的一次伟大的革命运动。
    经过一年来的文化大革命，我们已经把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揭露出来，把他们拉下马，让他们靠边站。这是无产阶级文化大革命的最重要成果。但是，正如红尖兵的文章所说的，从组织上夺了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，仅仅是夺权斗争的开始，绝不是夺权斗争的结束。就是说，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，仅仅从组织上打倒是远远不够的，还必须从政治上、思想上、理论上，对他们进行一场大批判、大揭露、大斗争，对他们这些腐朽的垃圾堆来一个彻底的大扫除。
    毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。这也和扫地一样，扫帚不到，灰尘照例不会自己跑掉。”党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，也是不打不倒的。他们在政治思想上的毒根扎得很深。不彻底批判，他们的流毒就不可能肃清。弄得不好，随时有复辟的可能。因此，我们无产阶级革命派绝对不能松懈自己的战斗意志，绝对“不要躺在床上，以为会来一阵什么大风，把灰尘统统刮掉。”
    进行这场大批判，最锐利的武器就是战无不胜的伟大的毛泽东思想。我们一定要在大批判中努力活学活用毛主席著作，边学习，边战斗。在大破资产阶级思想的同时，大立毛泽东思想，在思想理论阵地上开出灿烂的花朵。
    一切无产阶级革命派团结起来，联合起来，完成历史所赋予我们的这一光荣任务吧！
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，从根本上说，就是调动亿万群众，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺权。这是运动的斗争大方向。我们空军领导机关中的无产阶级革命派，遵循伟大领袖毛主席的教导，始终把斗争矛头指向以中国的赫鲁晓夫为总代表的党内军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，指向资产阶级反动司令部，把他们彻底粉碎。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是最危险最主要的敌人。他们混进无产阶级政权机构内部，建立资产阶级专政机构，从而造成了两个政权、两个司令部激烈斗争的局面。当然，就我们整个国家来说，是无产阶级政权占统治地位，被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派篡夺领导权而建立起来的资产阶级专政机构，只是某个局部、某个方面。但是，如果我们让其存在，任其发展，“那就不要很多时间，少则几年、十几年，多则几十年，就不可避免地要出现全国性的反革命复辟，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，变成法西斯党，整个中国就要改变颜色了。”所以，我们就是要通过无产阶级文化大革命，彻底粉碎以中国的赫鲁晓夫为总代表的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，彻底粉碎他们的资产阶级司令部。这是两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线之间极其复杂、极其深刻、极其激烈的大搏斗。
    毛主席说：“社会主义制度在我国已经基本建立。我们已经在生产资料所有制的改造方面，取得了基本胜利，但是在政治战线和思想战线方面，我们还没有完全取得胜利。无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的谁胜谁负问题，还没有真正解决。我们同资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想还要进行长期的斗争。”我们同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派争夺政权的斗争，不能不强烈地表现在政治思想战线方面。我们把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，从无产阶级政权机构内部揭露出来，撤他们的职，罢他们的官，这仅仅是夺权斗争的开始，绝不是夺权斗争的结束。“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”要把组织上的胜利，扩大到政治上、思想上的彻底胜利，还需要继续作艰苦的斗争。毛主席教导说：“我们决不可因为胜利，而放松对于帝国主义分子及其走狗们的疯狂的报复阴谋的警惕性，谁要是放松这一项警惕性，谁就将在政治上解除武装，而使自己处于被动的地位。”林副主席指出，党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，他们的人还在，心不死，他们在整个人口比例上占很少数，但是他们政治上的能量很大，他们的反抗力量比他们的人口比例大得多。无数事实也告诉我们，对于党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，从组织上打倒并不等于从政治上思想上打倒，撤职并不等于完全夺权，夺权也不简单地就是撤职。职和权是联系着的，但并不完全是一回事。有职固然有权，无职仍然可能有权。
    什么叫有权？有权，不仅是指有组织行政上的指挥权，而且意味着有政治上、思想上的指挥权。在政治上有势力，在群众中有影响，就会有人听他的指挥，到了一定的时候，就会转化为组织行政上的指挥权。
    党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派在政治上、思想上的权，主要表现在他们在群众中的影响。这是他们利用职权，打着红旗反红旗，在群众中进行欺骗活动的结果，也是由于他们多年来利用宣传机构，利用笔杆子，利用他们所窃取的思想教育阵地，在群众中制造反革命舆论的结果。这种政治上、思想上的权，采取自上而下地撤职、罢官等组织手段是剥夺不了的，必须通过自下而上开展广泛的群众性的大揭露、大批判，把以中国的赫鲁晓夫为总代表的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派长期以来反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想的罪行，批深、批透、批倒、批臭，彻底肃清他们在群众中的流毒和影响，才能剥夺他们在政治上、思想上的权，使他们今后再也不能欺骗群众。
    从组织上打倒和从政治上、思想上打倒，从组织上夺权和从政治上、思想上夺权，这是向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权的不可分割的两个方面。比较地来说，后者比前者更复杂、更重要。如果只是从组织上打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，从组织上夺他们的权，而不进一步从政治上、思想上把他们打倒，夺他们的权，这还不是彻底的打倒，不是彻底的夺权。而且，没有政治上、思想上的彻底胜利作保证，组织上的胜利也不会巩固，甚至随时可能被他们推翻；因为组织是人建立的，是受人的思想和意志支配的。“如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。”我们无产阶级革命派在伟大领袖毛主席领导下，不仅有决心有力量从组织上把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派打倒，从组织上夺他们的权，而且有决心有力量从政治上、思想上把他们打倒，从政治上、思想上夺他们的权，让他们永世不得翻身。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，他们的“政治资本”是骗来的，他们在这一方面也是“纸老虎”，因为他们复辟资本主义的阴谋是违背历史发展规律的。
    彻底从政治上、思想上批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是防止我们国家变颜色的关键。因为只有这样才能使他们不能东山再起；并且使我们革命群众警惕今后新的走资本主义道路当权派，如果一旦出现了，就很快地认清他们的真面目，坚决把他们打倒。因此，我们一定不仅要狠斗党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，把他们连人带思想统统打倒，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的总后台、总代表从组织上、政治上、思想上、理论上彻底埋葬，一定要狠挖反革命修正主义的社会思想基础，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    毛主席教导我们说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”“各种剥削阶级的代表人物，当着他们处在不利情况的时候，为了保护他们现在的生存，以利将来的发展，他们往往采取以攻为守的策略。……总之，他们老是在研究对付我们的策略，‘窥测方向’，以求一逞。有时他们会‘装死躺下’，等待时机，‘反攻过去’。”因此，我们在把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揪出来之前和揪出来之后，必须把斗争的矛头始终对准他们。有人说这是打“死老虎”，是“浪费弹药”。他们认为只有揪“活老虎”才是运动的重点，才能立汗马功劳，才符合斗争大方向。这种看法是不对的。我们认为，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派同一切阶级敌人一样，决不会轻易退出历史舞台，决不会甘心灭亡。“盘踞在大部分中国土地上的大蛇和小蛇，黑蛇和白蛇，露出毒牙的蛇和化成美女的蛇，虽然它们已经感觉到冬天的威胁，但是还没有冻僵呢！”　
    他们当中有些人在组织上“死”了，政治上、思想上还没有“死”，还不是“死老虎”，他们是“受伤的老虎”，有的还是“装死的老虎”、“假死的老虎”；而且有的人在组织上也没有“死”，还正在那里咬人。那些已被揪出来但还没有真正被打死的“老虎”，他们对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和革命群众更加仇恨，不仅妄图“秋后算账”、“十年报仇”，而且就在目前运动中，也都时刻利用他们在政治上、思想上的影响进行反扑，直接或间接地用各种各样的手段破坏无产阶级文化大革命。他们的这种挣扎，比被揪出来之前更加疯狂，更加狠毒。我们如果不把“受伤的老虎”、“装死的老虎”、“假死的老虎”和组织上也没有“死”的“老虎”统统打死，让他们永世不得翻身，就会被老虎吃掉，无产阶级文化大革命就会前功尽弃，正象毛主席所指出的那样：“或者把老虎打死，或者被老虎吃掉，二者必居其一。”
    “从本质上看，从长期上看，从战略上看，必须如实地把帝国主义和一切反动派，都看成纸老虎。从这点上，建立我们的战略思想。另一方面，它们又是活的铁的真的老虎，它们会吃人的。从这点上，建立我们的策略思想和战术思想。”为了彻底打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，我们必须实现和巩固革命的大联合，开展轰轰烈烈的人民战争，采用各种各样的斗争方式和灵活机动的战略战术，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行“寸权必夺”、“寸土必争”的反复搏斗。在战略上敢于藐视他们，在战术上肯于重视他们；在战略上有决心打持久战，在战术上有办法打速决战。
    打倒以中国的赫鲁晓夫为总代表的党内军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，彻底打碎他们的资产阶级司令部，最根本的是依靠伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，依靠毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，依靠毛泽东思想武装起来的革命群众，依靠毛主席领导我们创建的无产阶级政权。因此，我们要始终强调在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作，在斗争中大立毛泽东思想的崇高权威，在斗争中锻炼革命的阶级队伍，在斗争中加强无产阶级专政，这是取得无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的根本保证。
