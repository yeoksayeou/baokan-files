People's Liberation Army units stationed in Shanghai's Songjiang County and the Songjiang County People's Armed Forces Department, in accordance with Chairman Mao's directive on "where power needs to be seized, the revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' policy must be implemented," actively supported and assisted the proletarian revolutionary faction in Songjiang County to achieve revolutionary unity, promote the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," and seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the former Songjiang County Committee. On March 27, with the approval of the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee, a temporary power organ—the Songjiang County Revolutionary Committee—was established based on the "three-in-one combination."

	Insisting on the Revolutionary "Three-in-One Combination" Under the Guidance of Mao Zedong Thought

	The comrades from the PLA units stationed in Songjiang County and the Songjiang County People's Armed Forces Department have seriously studied Chairman Mao's directive on the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" policy. They understand that establishing a temporary power organ based on the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" is the result of the proletarian revolutionary faction's struggle to seize power from the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of the "three-in-one combination." Only the combination under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought is a genuine revolutionary "three-in-one combination." The "three-in-one combination" is not about merely bringing three elements together, nor can it be a compromise or a forced combination. The cadres who are included must be those who have been tested and trusted by the masses, genuine revolutionary leaders. In this regard, they have paid special attention to the following issues:

	1. Helping cadres to stand up and revolutionize themselves. During the process of promoting the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," the comrades from the units discovered that some cadres who had made general mistakes were hesitant and did not dare to stand up and "come out," waiting for others to come to them and include them. Some cadres with more serious mistakes felt that their problems were severe and wanted to stand up and revolutionize themselves but were afraid that the masses would not accept them. In short, they were waiting for others to support them and lacked the courage to stand up on their own.

	Forcing them to stand up is incorrect, and ignoring them and leaving them aside is also incorrect. Therefore, the comrades from the units organized these cadres to study Chairman Mao's relevant statements and editorials from the "Red Flag" magazine, helping them to correctly understand their shortcomings and mistakes; requiring them to follow Chairman Mao's words, consciously return to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, bravely expose and fight against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and resolutely draw a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line. Through study and struggle, their awareness has improved, their stance, viewpoint, and feelings have changed, and they have decided to stand up and have the courage to do so.

	2. Insisting on Chairman Mao's long-standing teachings on the correct standards for identifying and using cadres. During the process of promoting the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," the comrades from the units felt that it was particularly necessary to help the masses correctly handle two types of cadres: one type is those who have been energetic and active in their work, with many shortcomings and mistakes exposed, and some of whom unconsciously executed the bourgeois reactionary line during the Cultural Revolution, thus receiving more criticism from the masses. This type of cadre, from a fundamental perspective and from their entire history, supports the Party and Chairman Mao and resolutely follows the socialist path. Moreover, through the education of the Cultural Revolution mass movement, they have already gained some understanding of their mistakes. However, due to the masses' temporary emotional resistance, it is often difficult for them to pass through. The other type of cadre is the so-called "good person." They lack revolutionary spirit, are lazy and sluggish in their daily work, and did not do much during the Cultural Revolution, thus not committing the mistake of executing the bourgeois reactionary line. This type of cadre is relatively easy to pass through. The comrades from the units believe that identifying cadres must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, first paying attention to their major principles. That is, whether they uphold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, whether they emphasize politics, and whether they have revolutionary spirit.

	To solve this problem, the comrades from the units worked from two aspects. On one hand, they relied on revolutionary mass organizations to educate the broad masses, requiring everyone to identify and use cadres according to the five conditions for proletarian revolutionary successors proposed by Chairman Mao and the three standards proposed by Comrade Lin Biao; on the other hand, for those cadres who were energetic and had a strong sense of responsibility but, due to their lack of understanding of the Cultural Revolution, were deceived and unconsciously executed the bourgeois reactionary line, political and ideological work must be strengthened to help them further recognize their mistakes, stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, make a deep self-examination and confession to the masses, and seek the masses' understanding.

	3. Actively criticizing and educating some cadres who hold incorrect attitudes towards the "three-in-one combination" policy. After the "three-in-one combination" policy was proposed, some cadres became arrogant, thinking they were objects of the "three-in-one combination," and even criticized the proletarian revolutionary faction. Facing this situation, the comrades from the units, relying on revolutionary mass organizations, severely criticized these cadres, strongly supporting the proletarian revolutionary faction and maintaining their prestige.

	Relying on the Proletarian Revolutionary Faction to Implement the Mass Line

	Chairman Mao said: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and laughable, not understanding this point, we cannot gain even the most basic knowledge." The revolutionary masses are most familiar with the situation in their local areas and units. In supporting the proletarian revolutionary faction's struggle to seize power, the units must firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionary faction and resolutely implement the mass line to achieve the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

	1. Relying on the proletarian revolutionary faction to understand the situation of the cadre team. To promote the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," it is necessary to understand the situation of the county's leading cadres. The comrades from the units went deep into the masses, held various symposiums, conducted individual visits, and widely listened to opinions. During the investigation, the comrades from the units, together with the proletarian revolutionary faction, seriously analyzed the situation of the leading cadres, understood the strengths and weaknesses of the cadres, studied the subjective and objective causes of their mistakes; understood the relationship between essence and non-essence, and between major and minor issues. In this way, the comrades from the units gained a clear understanding, and the broad masses' awareness was unified, laying the foundation for determining the objects of the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

	2. Relying on the revolutionary masses to help cadres who meet the conditions for the "three-in-one combination" truly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The comrades from the units assisted the revolutionary mass organizations to hold large and small meetings, allowing the leading cadres who met the conditions for the "three-in-one combination" to make self-examinations and come out, mobilizing them to fight face-to-face against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the former county committee. Through these opportunities, relying on the broad revolutionary masses, the leading cadres were further examined, examining their recognition of their mistakes, their attitude towards the proletarian Cultural Revolution, their attitude towards the revolutionary masses, and whether they could resolutely fight against and draw a clear line with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, helping them to improve their awareness and truly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

	3. The work of promoting the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" cannot be separated from the revolutionary masses, and the exercise of revolutionary authority by the temporary power organ based on the "three-in-one combination" also cannot be separated from the revolutionary masses. The comrades from the units emphasized that those who uphold the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely execute the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao, have made significant contributions to the Cultural Revolution, and have prestige among the masses must be selected to participate in the temporary power organ based on the "three-in-one combination." With the participation of these revolutionary spirit-rich mass organization representatives in the temporary power organ, they continuously reflect the demands and opinions of the revolutionary masses, propose revolutionary measures, keep the members of the revolutionary committee awake, grasp the direction of the struggle, and exercise the revolutionary authority of the revolutionary committee.

	Treating the Process of Promoting the "Three-in-One Combination" as a Process of Promoting Ideological Revolutionization

	In the process of promoting the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," the units must help the revolutionary masses and revolutionary leading cadres to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, fight the ideological battle of breaking private interests and establishing public interests, and treat the process of promoting the "three-in-one combination" as a process of promoting ideological revolutionization.

	The comrades from the units, in the process of promoting the "three-in-one combination," firmly grasped the link of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively. They helped the proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary leading cadres to study the "Three Constantly Read Articles" and Chairman Mao's statements on cadre policy with the living thoughts in the "three-in-one combination." In the study, they connected their thoughts, deeply touched their souls, and thoroughly criticized the "private" self. They said, we have displayed great revolutionary spirit, thoroughly criticized the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and drawn a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line. We must also, with great revolutionary spirit, thoroughly criticize the "private" self in our minds; only by overcoming the "private" self can we correctly execute Chairman Mao's cadre policy; only by overcoming the "private" self can we make new contributions to implementing Chairman Mao's directive on the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." After their awareness was raised, the proletarian revolutionary faction enthusiastically and resolutely supported the revolutionary leading cadres to stand up. The revolutionary leading cadres proposed that "coming out" must reveal one's thoughts, and standing up must discard the "private" self. Many cadres changed their "fear" to "dare," changed their "wait" to "strive," actively sought opinions from the masses, and bravely revealed their thoughts, examining their mistakes.

	By overcoming the "private" self and establishing the "public" self, the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" was promoted, and the ideological revolutionization of people was also promoted. The proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary leading cadres united under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought. Under the leadership of the revolutionary committee, the proletarian Cultural Revolution in Songjiang County is developing more deeply and healthily.

    解放军驻松江部队和松江县武装部积极支持无产阶级革命派
    用毛泽东思想促进革命的“三结合”
    据新华社上海电　人民解放军驻上海市松江县部队和松江县人民武装部，遵照毛主席关于“在需要夺权的那些地方和单位，必须实行革命的‘三结合’的方针”的指示，积极支持和帮助松江县的无产阶级革命派实现革命大联合，促进革命的“三结合”，向旧松江县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权。三月二十七日，经上海市革命委员会批准，成立了“三结合”的临时权力机构——松江县革命委员会。
    坚持在毛泽东思想指导下的革命的“三结合”
    人民解放军驻松江部队和松江县人民武装部的同志，认真学习毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”的方针，认识到建立革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构，是无产阶级革命派向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派夺权斗争的结果。毛泽东思想是“三结合”的灵魂。在毛泽东思想指导下的结合，才是真正的革命的“三结合”。“三结合”不是三凑合，不能搞折衷，更不能生拉硬凑。结合进来的干部，一定是要经过考验的为群众所信任的真正的革命领导干部。在这方面，他们特别注意了这样几个问题：
    一、帮助干部自己站出来革命。在促进革命“三结合”的过程中，部队同志发现，有些犯有一般错误的干部，抱着犹豫观望的态度，不敢主动站出来“亮相”，等待别人找上门来，把自己结合进去。一些错误比较严重的干部，则感到自己的问题严重，想站出来革命，又怕群众通不过。总之，他们在等待别人来扶自己，缺乏自己站出来的勇气。
    硬扶起来是不对的，对他们不问不闻，把他们扔在一边，同样是不对的。为此，部队同志组织这些干部学习毛主席的有关论述，学习《红旗》杂志社论，使他们正确认识自己的缺点错误；要求他们听毛主席的话，自觉地回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线上来，勇敢地向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行揭发斗争，坚决地和资产阶级反动路线划清界限。通过学习、斗争，他们的认识有所提高，立场、观点、感情有所转变，并且有了站出来的决心和勇气。
    二、坚持毛主席历来教导的识别和使用干部的正确标准。在促进革命“三结合”的过程中，部队同志感到，特别需要帮助群众正确对待两种干部：一种是干劲足，一向积极工作，缺点和错误也暴露得比较多，有的在文化大革命期间不自觉地执行过资产阶级反动路线，因而群众的意见比较多。这种干部，从本质上来看，从他们的全部历史来看，是拥护党，拥护毛主席，坚决走社会主义道路的，而且经过文化大革命群众运动的教育，对自己的错误也已经有了一定认识。但是由于群众一时感情上转不过来，往往不易通过。另一种干部，就是所谓的“老好人”。他们没有革命干劲，平时疲疲沓沓，在文化大革命期间也没有干什么工作，因而没有犯执行资产阶级反动路线的错误。这种干部，反而比较容易通过。部队同志认为，识别干部，必须遵照毛主席的教导和林彪同志的指示，首先注意大节。就是要看他们是不是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，是不是突出政治，有没有革命干劲。
    为了解决这个问题，部队同志从两方面进行了工作。一方面，依靠革命的群众组织，对广大群众进行教育，要求大家按照毛主席提出的无产阶级革命事业接班人的五个条件和林彪同志提出的三条标准，来识别和使用干部；另一方面，对那些革命干劲足，工作责任心强，但是由于对文化大革命不够理解，受了蒙蔽，不自觉地执行了资产阶级反动路线的干部，要加强政治思想工作，启发他们进一步认识自己的错误，站到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边来，向群众作深刻的检查交代，求得群众的谅解。
    三、向一些对革命“三结合”方针抱有错误态度的干部，积极开展批评教育。革命“三结合”的方针提出以后，有的干部翘起尾巴来了，自认为是“三结合”的对象，并且对无产阶级革命派指手划脚。针对这种情况，部队同志又依靠革命群众组织，对这些干部提出严厉的批评。有力地支持了无产阶级革命派，维护了无产阶级革命派的威信。
    依靠无产阶级革命派贯彻群众路线
    毛主席说：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的，不了解这一点，就不能得到起码的知识。”革命群众对本地区本单位的情况最熟悉，部队在支援无产阶级革命派的夺权斗争中，必须坚定地站在无产阶级革命派一边，坚决贯彻群众路线，才能实现革命的“三结合”。
    一、依靠无产阶级革命派，弄清干部队伍的状况。要促进革命的“三结合”，就要了解县的领导干部的情况。部队同志深入群众，召开各种座谈会，进行个别访问，广泛听取意见。在调查过程中，部队同志同无产阶级革命派一起，对领导干部的情况作了认真的分析，弄清干部的优点成绩和缺点错误，研究了他们犯错误的主观原因和客观原因；弄清本质和非本质的关系，大节与小节的关系。这样，既使部队同志做到了心中有数，也统一了广大群众的认识，为确定革命“三结合”的对象准备了条件。
    二、依靠革命群众，帮助具备“三结合”条件的干部真正回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。部队同志协助革命群众组织，召开大小会议，让具备“三结合”条件的领导干部检查亮相，发动他们对旧县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行面对面的斗争。通过这些机会，依靠广大革命群众，对领导干部作了进一步的考查，考查他们对自己错误的认识，对无产阶级文化大革命的态度，对革命群众的态度，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派能不能坚决斗争，划清界限，帮助他们提高认识，真正回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    三、促进革命“三结合”的工作，离不开革命群众，发挥革命“三结合”临时权力机构的革命权威，也离不开革命群众。部队同志强调，一定要把那些高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决执行以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，对文化大革命作出了重大贡献，在群众中有威望的革命群众组织负责人，选派到“三结合”临时权力机构中来。有了这些富有革命精神的群众组织代表参加临时权力机构，他们不断反映革命群众的要求和意见，提出革命性措施，使革命委员会的成员经常保持清醒的头脑，掌握斗争的大方向，发挥革命委员会的革命权威。
    把促进“三结合”的过程当作促进思想革命化的过程
    部队在促进革命的“三结合”的过程中，必须帮助革命群众和革命领导干部活学活用毛主席著作，打好破私立公的思想仗，把促进“三结合”的过程，当作促进思想革命化的过程。
    部队同志在促进“三结合”的过程中，紧紧抓住了活学活用毛主席著作这一环。帮助无产阶级革命派和革命领导干部，带着“三结合”中的活思想，学习“老三篇”和毛主席关于干部政策的论述。在学习中，他们联系思想，狠触灵魂，大破“私”字。他们说，我们发扬了大无畏的革命精神，大造了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，与资产阶级反动路线划清界限，我们也要以大无畏的革命精神，大造自己头脑里“私”字的反；只有克服“私”字，才能正确执行毛主席的干部政策；只有克服“私”字，才能为实现毛主席提出的革命的“三结合”方针作出新的贡献。认识提高以后，无产阶级革命派热情地坚决地支持革命领导干部站出来。革命领导干部提出，“亮相”必须亮出思想，站出来必须扔掉“私”字。许多干部变“怕”字为“敢”字，变“等”字为“争”字，主动到群众中去征求意见，大胆地亮出自己的思想，检查了自己的错误。
    破了“私”字，立了“公”字，促进了革命的“三结合”，又促进了人的思想革命化。无产阶级革命派和革命领导干部，在毛泽东思想的旗帜下结合起来了。在革命委员会的领导下，松江县的无产阶级文化大革命，正在更深入更健康地向前发展。
