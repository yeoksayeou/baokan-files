The roaring revolutionary torrent has breached the sandbanks and decaying dams of revisionism, surging forward with irresistible momentum. The throne of China's Khrushchev has collapsed! This "fallen dog" has already been engulfed by the vast ocean of criticism and struggle by hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses!

Although China's Khrushchev has been exposed by the broad revolutionary masses and has become a "fallen dog," he has not yet been thoroughly criticized politically, ideologically, and theoretically, nor has he been completely overthrown and denounced, and thrown into the abyss. He is always trying to crawl back up, waiting for an opportunity to counterattack. We revolutionary comrades must never relax our vigilance or be complacent.

In the current great criticism, the revolutionary workers of our factory are actively exposing and criticizing the revisionist line that China's Khrushchev implemented in our factory. However, due to the differences among the mass organizations in our factory, the great criticism cannot be conducted in a unified manner, the firepower is scattered, and this affects the power of the great criticism. We should follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "Organize tens of millions of people, mobilize the surging revolutionary army," unite to carry out the great criticism, achieve great unity in the great criticism, promote the revolution's "three-in-one combination," and do a good job in the struggle, production, and work in our factory. This is the urgent task for our factory. The proletarian revolutionary cadres must all be models of great criticism and models of great unity!

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party is the most dangerous enemy. We proletarian revolutionary cadres must always remember the direction of the struggle and always remember this main enemy.

Although there are various different opinions and disagreements among the revolutionary mass organizations, in the great criticism and struggle against China's Khrushchev, they are completely united. Whether the disagreements among the revolutionary mass organizations are non-principled or principled, compared to the disagreements with China's Khrushchev, they are secondary. There are a thousand reasons, ten thousand reasons, but not a single reason not to unite; there are a thousand difficulties, ten thousand difficulties, but by throwing ourselves into the great criticism, we can overcome the main difficulties of unity. Whether or not to achieve great unity in the revolution is the touchstone to test whether a person or an organization will carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end.

The proletarian revolutionary cadres must closely follow Chairman Mao's strategic deployment, carry forward Lu Xun's revolutionary spirit of "beating the fallen dog," unite, and give China's Khrushchev, this "fallen dog," a fierce beating, a hard beating, not giving him any chance to breathe, until he cannot crawl back up, until he is completely buried in the vast ocean of the great criticism!

"We will definitely achieve our goal.
We will definitely achieve our goal."

    使敌人陷入汪洋大海
    北京东方红汽车制造厂东方红公社  王中均  张德祥
    “钟山风雨起苍黄，百万雄师过大江。”滚滚的革命洪流，冲决了修正主义的沙堤朽坝，奔腾咆哮，势不可挡。中国的赫鲁晓夫的宝座倒塌了！这条“落水狗”已陷入亿万革命群众大批判、大斗争的汪洋大海之中！
    虽然中国的赫鲁晓夫已被广大的革命群众揪了出来，成了“落水狗”，但是还没有从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底把他批深批透，批倒批臭，把他打入万丈深渊。他每时每刻都在妄想爬上岸来，伺机反扑。我们革命同志，万万不可放松警惕，掉以轻心。
    在当前革命的大批判中，我厂广大革命工人群众，正在起来积极揭露、批判中国的赫鲁晓夫在我厂实行的修正主义的办厂路线。但是由于我厂群众组织之间存在着分歧，使大批判不能统一进行，火力分散，影响到大批判的威力。应该象毛主席所教导的那样：“组织千千万万的民众，调动浩浩荡荡的革命军”，联合起来进行革命的大批判，在大批判中实现革命的大联合，促进革命的“三结合”，搞好本厂的斗批改，抓好革命，促好生产，搞好工作，这是我厂当务之急。无产阶级革命派都应该做革命的大批判的模范！做革命的大联合的模范！
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派是最危险的敌人，我们无产阶级革命派一定要念念不忘斗争大方向，念念不忘这个最主要的敌人。
    尽管革命群众组织之间有各种不同的意见和分歧，但是，在向中国的赫鲁晓夫进行大批判、大斗争这个目标上是完全一致的。不管革命群众组织之间分歧是非原则性的，还是原则性的，比起同中国的赫鲁晓夫的分歧来都是次要的。千条理，万条理，说不出一条不联合的理；千种困难，万种困难，全力投入革命的大批判就能克服联合起来的主要困难。要不要革命的大联合，是检验一个人和一个组织是否要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的试金石。
    无产阶级革命派一定要紧跟毛主席的战略部署，发扬鲁迅的“痛打落水狗”的革命精神，联合起来，对中国的赫鲁晓夫这条“落水狗”，猛打，狠打，不给他以丝毫的喘息机会，直到打得他爬不上岸来，直到把他彻底埋葬在革命大批判的汪洋大海之中！
    “我们的目的一定要达到。
    我们的目的一定能够达到。”
