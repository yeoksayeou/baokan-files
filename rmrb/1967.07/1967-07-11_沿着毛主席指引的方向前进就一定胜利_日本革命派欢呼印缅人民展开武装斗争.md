Japanese revolutionaries hail armed struggle by peoples of India and Burma

	BEIJING, July 9 (Xinhua) — According to a report from the Oriental News Agency, Japanese revolutionaries recently spoke to a reporter from the Oriental News Agency, expressing enthusiastic praise and firm support for the peoples of India and Burma as they wage revolutionary armed struggle under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought.

	Kojiro Kobayashi, chairman of the Japanese Journalists' Alliance, emphasized: "Revolutionary communists in India are leading peasants in West Bengal's Darjeeling district in armed struggle. This is a major event for all of Asia. The revolutionary peoples of Asia, especially journalists, should resolutely support and encourage these armed forces of the people."

	Kojiro Kobayashi pointed out that the broad masses of the Indian people have seen a bright future in the sparks ignited in the Darjeeling region.

	Kojiro Kobayashi pointed out, "As Chairman Mao teaches us, 'political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.' This is a universal truth that every revolutionary must never forget for a moment." He went on, "The peasants who have risen up in the Darjeeling region have overcome numerous difficulties on their path forward. As long as they follow the path indicated by Chairman Mao of establishing rural base areas, persisting in protracted armed struggle, and encircling the cities from the countryside to ultimately seize the cities, they will surely achieve final victory."

	Kojiro Kobayashi stressed: "The future of Asia is firmly in the hands of the revolutionary peoples who have risen up. The ambitions of U.S. imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of Japan and other parts of the world to dominate Asia will never be realized. Japanese revolutionary people and journalists must clearly grasp the grand direction and exert every effort to fulfill their mission."

	Kato Nagao, a researcher on Asian and African issues, said: "The path of people's war pointed out by Chairman Mao is the only path for the oppressed peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America to gain liberation from the dark rule of imperialism and reactionaries. No force can stop the peoples of India and Burma from taking this path."

	Kato expressed firm support for the armed struggle of the peoples of India and Burma. He said: "At a time when the peoples of India and Burma are rising up to resolutely struggle against the U.S. imperialists, who are using the Glassboro talks as an opportunity to further strengthen their counter-revolutionary collusion with the Soviet revisionist ruling clique, and are frantically engaging in anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-China activities, this makes the revolutionary peoples of Asia feel greatly inspired and makes the reactionary forces led by the U.S. and the Soviet Union feel greatly afraid."

	Miyazaki Hachiji, a student at Tokyo's Waseda University, said: When the Indian reactionaries are facing increasing difficulties, and the traitorous clique led by Dange and the revisionist elements within the Indian Communist Party have betrayed the Indian people, revolutionary party members of the Indian Communist Party and the Indian people have risen up under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought to resolutely wage armed struggle. This is a great thing, a correct path leading the Indian people to victory.

	Miyazaki expressed great joy and full support for the development of the armed struggle of the Burmese people. He firmly believes that the revolutionary peoples of India, Burma, and other countries, as long as they resolutely arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and wage armed struggle, will surely unite all the people and definitely achieve final victory.

    沿着毛主席指引的方向前进就一定胜利
    日本革命派欢呼印缅人民展开武装斗争
    新华社九日讯　据东方通讯社报道，日本革命派最近对东方通讯社记者发表谈话，热情赞扬和坚决支持印度和缅甸人民在毛泽东思想指导下开展革命武装斗争。
    日本记者同盟主席小林雄一强调说：“革命的印度共产党员领导印度农民在西孟加拉邦大吉岭县开展了武装斗争。这是全亚洲的一件大事。亚洲的革命人民，特别是新闻工作者，应该坚决支持和鼓励这些人民武装力量。”
    小林雄一指出，印度广大人民群众通过在大吉岭地区燃起的星星之火，看到了光明的前途。
    小林雄一指出，正如毛主席教导我们的：“枪杆子里面出政权”。这是每个革命者一刻也不能忘记的普遍真理。他接着说：“大吉岭地区已经站起来的农民，在他们的前进道路上克服了重重困难。只要他们沿着毛泽东主席指引的在农村建立根据地，坚持持久的武装斗争，以农村包围城市和最后夺取城市的道路前进，他们就一定能赢得最后胜利。”
    小林雄一强调说：“亚洲的前途已经牢牢掌握在那些已经起来的革命人民的手中。美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义、日本和世界其他地方的反动派统治亚洲的野心决不能得逞。日本革命人民和新闻工作者应该明确掌握大方向，竭尽全力完成他们的任务。”
    亚非问题研究工作者加藤长男说：“毛泽东主席所指出的人民战争的道路是亚非拉被压迫人民从帝国主义和反动派的黑暗统治下获得解放的唯一道路。任何力量都不能阻挡印度和缅甸人民走这条道路。”
    加藤表示坚决支持印度和缅甸人民的武装斗争。他说：“印度和缅甸人民在美帝国主义趁葛拉斯堡罗会谈的机会进一步加强同苏修统治集团的反革命勾结，拚命地进行反共、反人民和反华活动的时候，起来坚决斗争，坚持和发展武装斗争，这使以美苏为首的反革命势力感到害怕，而使亚洲革命人民感到无比的鼓舞。”
    东京早稻田大学学生宫崎八治说：当印度反动派遇到越来越大的困难，以丹吉为首的叛徒集团和印度共产党内的修正主义分子背叛了印度人民的时候，印度共产党的革命的党员和印度人民在毛泽东思想指引下已经起来坚决进行武装斗争。这是一件了不起的事情，是引导印度人民走向胜利的正确道路。
    宫崎八治对缅甸人民的武装斗争的发展表示欢欣鼓舞和全力支持。他坚信，印度、缅甸和其他国家的革命人民只要坚决地用毛泽东思想武装起来，进行武装斗争，就一定能团结全体人民，一定会取得最后胜利。
