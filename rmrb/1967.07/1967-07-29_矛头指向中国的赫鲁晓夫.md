Under the personal leadership of our great helmsman Chairman Mao, the torrential wave of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has breached one defensive line after another of the bourgeois black headquarters. The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, with China's Khrushchev at their head, have already been encircled by the mighty army of the proletarian revolution.

This is a great victory, but it is not the final victory. The present moment is a crucial juncture. At this critical time, the soldiers of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution must decide: shall we rest on our laurels, cease fighting, and let the revolution peter out halfway? Or shall we press on, pursue the fleeing enemy, and give the fallen dog a good beating? There is only one correct answer: millions upon millions of spearheads must be directed at China's Khrushchev, and a mass movement of revolutionary criticism must be launched to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

Throughout history, have any of the political representatives of the reactionary classes ever voluntarily retired from the stage of history? None have. The representatives of the bourgeoisie who have infiltrated the Party, with China's Khrushchev at their head, are no exception. Although they have been pushed aside and knocked down, in their dying throes they are still mustering their strength, lying in wait for an opportunity to stage a comeback and counterattack the revolutionary people. Chairman Mao has repeatedly instructed us:

"The question of who will win in the revolution, and who will lose, can only be settled over a very long historical period. If things are not handled properly, there is the danger of capitalist restoration at any time." Recently, China's Khrushchev has put forward a "self-criticism" that is false in confession but true in counterattack. From this, we can clearly see his ferocious intent, his fangs bared and eyes gleaming. He has come out again to be our negative example. In the midst of class struggle, we must make revolutionary criticism our most important task and devote our utmost efforts to it. We must neither be intimidated by his ferocious appearance nor be deceived by his honeyed words. We have already seen clearly: if we do not, in the course of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize the chief power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and expose and denounce him, then the great struggle to prevent capitalist restoration will be in vain, and we will commit a historical error. "Feuerbach" must be put on hold, and the fallen dog must be given a good beating. We must thoroughly purge the counter-revolutionary revisionist poison that the chief power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road has spread over the past seventeen years in every field! In the midst of the fiery struggle of the revolution, we will cultivate tens of millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is about thoroughly criticizing and repudiating bourgeois ideology and establishing proletarian ideology. This thorough criticism and repudiation, establishment and consolidation, must primarily be carried out in the course of revolutionary criticism. "Criticism is revolution. Criticism must be reasoned. Reasoned criticism is establishment. Criticism comes first, and establishment is contained within it." In the course of revolutionary criticism, the dictatorship of the proletariat will be more consolidated, the ranks of the proletariat will be more united, a new generation of proletarians will grow up more vigorously, and the cause of the proletarian revolution will open up a new situation and enter a new era.

Under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, all revolutionary forces must unite! Millions upon millions of pens of revolutionary criticism must be brandished, all pointing in one direction, pointing at China's Khrushchev and his clique, and burying them!

    矛头指向中国的赫鲁晓夫
    北航红旗  侯玉山
    在我们伟大统帅毛主席的亲自领导下，无产阶级文化大革命群众运动的洪流，冲决了资产阶级黑司令部一道又一道防线。以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，已经陷入了无产阶级革命大军的重围之中。
    这是伟大的胜利，但还不是最后的胜利。目前正是又一个紧要关头。在这样的关键时刻，无产阶级文化革命大军的战士们，是枕着胜利的果实高卧不起，息鼓收兵，使革命半途而废？还是乘胜追穷寇，痛打落水狗？正确的答案只有一个：千百万矛头一致指向中国的赫鲁晓夫，开展群众性的革命大批判运动，把这场无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    古今中外一切反动阶级的政治代表，有哪一个是肯自动退出历史舞台的呢？翻遍历史，一个也没有。混进党内的以中国的赫鲁晓夫为首的资产阶级代表人物，岂能例外。他们虽然已经靠边站，被打翻在地，但是他们在垂死之中，还要积蓄力量，窥伺时机，准备卷土重来，向革命人民反扑。毛主席谆谆教导我们：
  “革命的谁胜谁负，要在一个很长的历史时期内才能解决。如果弄得不好，资本主义复辟将是随时可能的。”最近，中国的赫鲁晓夫抛出了假认罪、真反扑的“检查”。从这里面，我们可以清楚地看到他拭嘴磨牙、虎视眈眈的凶相。他又出来给我们当反面教员了。在复课闹革命中，我们要把革命的大批判作为最重要的功课，下最大的功夫上好这门课。我们既不为他的张牙舞爪的凶相所吓倒，也不为他的花言巧语的假相所迷惑。我们已经清楚地看到：如果不在革命的大批判中，把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底地批深批透，批倒批臭，那就会使防止复辟资本主义的伟大斗争功败于垂成，我们就要犯历史性的错误。“费厄泼赖”必须缓行，落水之狗必须痛打。我们一定要把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派十七年来散布在各个领域的反革命修正主义流毒，彻底肃清！在轰轰烈烈的革命斗争中，造就出千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    无产阶级文化大革命，就是要大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想。这种大破大立，主要是要在革命的大批判中进行。“破，就是批判，就是革命。破，就要讲道理，讲道理就是立，破字当头，立也就在其中了。”在革命的大批判中，无产阶级专政必将更加强固，无产阶级队伍必将更加团结，无产阶级的一代新人必将更加茁壮地成长起来，无产阶级革命事业必将开创一个崭新的局面，进入一个崭新的时代。
    在毛泽东思想伟大红旗下，一切革命力量联合起来！千百万支大批判的笔，一齐挥动起来，指着一个方向，指着中国的赫鲁晓夫及其一伙，把他们彻底埋葬！
