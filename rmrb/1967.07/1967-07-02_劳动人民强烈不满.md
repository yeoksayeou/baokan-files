Editor's Note: Since the Khrushchev clique seized power in the Soviet Union, they have opened the door wide to "Western culture." Brezhnev and Kosygin and the like have gone even further than Khrushchev, acting more brazenly. In politics and economics, they are increasingly colluding with the imperialist countries, and in culture, they have completely bowed down to the Western world. Their shameful faces of worshipping, befriending, and flattering the United States are particularly blatant in the cultural sphere.

Imperialism is the dying, parasitic, and decadent capitalism. Their spiritual world is empty and declining. Their so-called "culture" is nothing but using various poisons such as murder, debauchery, and decadence to poison and numb the people, in order to maintain their rule. The Soviet revisionist ruling clique, as the representative of the new and old bourgeoisie in the Soviet Union, in order to restore capitalism and maintain their reactionary rule, first of all, in the ideological sphere, they are carrying out a counter-revolutionary restoration. They bring the most reactionary, most decadent, and most ugly so-called "Western culture" of American and British imperialism to the Soviet Union, letting it spread rampantly. Things like the twist dance, jazz music, Hollywood movies, these stinking trash are treated as treasures, indoctrinated to the Soviet people, poisoning and destroying the younger generation of the Soviet Union. From this, one can also see how far the Soviet revisionist clique has degenerated. They have committed heinous crimes against the Soviet people!

The Soviet revisionist clique, this small group of traitorous and running-dog clique, is so perverse and lawless, and can only dig their own graves and accelerate their own doom.

The Working People Are Strongly Dissatisfied

The Soviet revisionist ruling clique, in order to restore capitalism, unscrupulously peddles the stinking "culture" of the West, promotes Western films, and has aroused strong dissatisfaction among the ordinary working people of the Soviet Union.

A Soviet woman, talking about American "gangster" movies, said indignantly: "How can they allow the propaganda of gangsterism that tramples on the hearts of our young people? Who should be held responsible for this propaganda?" A teacher from the Urals said, "Apart from American 'gangster' movies that depict murder cases, movies that depict various low tastes and promote the desire to get rich quickly are also harmful." Even the Soviet *Izvestia* had to admit: "A large number of foreign films with enticing titles and 'box office hits' have appeared on the screen, making readers feel surprised, worried, and indignant."

The Soviet revisionist clique, out of reactionary class instincts and the needs of their class interests, not only eagerly peddles Western films but also frantically "learns" from the West. In recent years, they have produced a large number of filthy films imitating the West. These films are also despised by the working people. For example, a lathe operator wrote in a letter to *Soviet Culture*: "Nowadays, it often happens that I sit and watch a new movie, yawning and cursing under my breath: 'Wasting time!'"

专栏：看苏修怎样在国内复辟资本主义

    编者按　自从赫鲁晓夫集团篡夺了苏联的政权以来，他们就向“西方文化”敞开了大门。勃列日涅夫和柯西金之流，比赫鲁晓夫走得更远，干得更加肆无忌惮。他们在政治上、经济上跟帝国主义国家日益密切地勾结，在文化上也完全拜倒在西方世界的脚下。他们崇美、亲美、媚美的可耻嘴脸，在文化方面表现得非常露骨。
    帝国主义是垂死的、寄生的、腐朽的资本主义，他们的精神世界是空虚的、没落的。他们所谓的“文化”，只不过是用凶杀、淫荡、颓废等各种毒剂，毒害和麻痹人民，以维持自己的统治。苏修统治集团这个苏联新旧资产阶级的总代表，为了复辟资本主义，为了维持它的反动统治，首先在意识形态方面大搞反革命复辟。他们把美英帝国主义的最反动、最腐朽、最丑恶的所谓“西方文化”，搬到苏联来，让它大肆泛滥。什么阿飞舞、什么爵士音乐、什么好莱坞影片，这些臭不可闻的破烂，都被当做宝贝，灌输给苏联人民，毒害和摧残苏联青年一代。人们由此也可以看到，苏修集团已经堕落到何等地步。他们对苏联人民犯下了滔天罪行！
    苏修集团这一小撮叛徒工贼集团如此倒行逆施，胡作非为，只能是自掘坟墓，加速自己的灭亡。
　　劳动人民强烈不满
    苏修统治集团不择手段地大肆贩卖西方臭不可闻的“文化”，推销西方电影，引起了苏联普通劳动人民的强烈不满。
    一位苏联妇女谈到美国“强盗”电影时气愤地说：“怎么能许可宣传蹂躏我国青年心灵的强盗主义？谁应对这种宣传负责？”乌拉尔的一位教师说，除了描写凶杀案的美国“强盗”影片之外，“描绘各种低级趣味，宣传渴望发横财等影片，同样是有害的。”连苏联《消息报》也不得不承认：“在银幕上大量涌现出外国的有着诱人名称的‘很卖座的影片’，使读者感到惊奇、担忧和愤慨。”
    苏修集团出于反动的阶级本能及其阶级利益的需要，不仅热中于贩卖西方电影，而且自己也拚命向西方“学习”，近年来摄制了大量乌七八糟的模仿西方的影片。这种影片同样遭到劳动人民的唾弃。例如，一位旋工在写给《苏维埃文化报》的信中说：“目前常常出现这样一种情况：我坐着，在看一部新影片，打着呵欠，低声地骂道：‘白费时间！’”
