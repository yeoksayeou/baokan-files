A massive revolutionary criticism movement is sweeping across the urban and rural areas of Shandong in a grand and powerful manner. The broad masses of workers, peasants, soldiers, Red Guards, revolutionary teachers and students, and revolutionary cadres throughout the province, following the great leader Chairman Mao's instruction to "carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end," are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, denouncing and attacking with both pen and speech, pursuing and striking down the fallen dogs, determined to overthrow the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to smash their entire set of counter-revolutionary revisionist goods to pieces, to bury them in the vast ocean of people's war, and to make them stink for a thousand years, never to rise again.

The revolutionary masses and cadres of Shandong, through their exposure and criticism of China's Khrushchev and his poisonous weeds "On Cultivation," and through their study of the great historical document, the May 16 Circular of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China in 1966, have come to a deeper understanding: to carry out this great criticism is a crucial matter for us in the new situation to grasp power correctly and use it well, to consolidate and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat, and it is a major issue concerning whether to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end or to stop halfway. It is a major issue concerning the future of the Chinese revolution and the destiny of all mankind. Chairman Mao teaches us: "In human history, all reactionary forces that are about to perish always make their last struggles against the revolutionary forces." The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their agents in Shandong, although they have already fallen into the vast ocean of people's war and become fallen dogs, are still alive and their hearts are not dead. They are always trying to restore their lost "paradise." We must carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of striking down fallen dogs and "show no mercy to snake-like evil persons." To be lenient to the enemy is to be cruel to the people. To thoroughly criticize and expose them is a top political task of great practical and historical significance.

To closely combine the criticism of China's Khrushchev with the criticism of the biggest power-holder within the Party in Shandong who is taking the capitalist road, on July 5, the Shandong Revolutionary Committee and the Shandong Military District Committee of the Communist Party issued notices respectively, calling for the criticism movement to reach a new high tide throughout the province. They called on all revolutionary masses of the proletariat and revolutionary cadres in the province, as well as all officers and soldiers of the garrison troops and all militia members, to take immediate action to push the revolutionary criticism movement to a new high tide throughout the province and to closely combine the revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the province.

The broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Shandong have deeply felt in the struggle that to fight this battle well, the most fundamental and crucial point is to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively. To further grasp the powerful weapon of Mao Zedong Thought and to carry out the criticism and struggle more deeply and widely, the Standing Committee of the Shandong Revolutionary Committee took the lead in insisting on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works every day, in addition to studying for one hour each day, they also set aside two and a half days each week to concentrate on studying with the spirit of rectification. From the province to many regions and units, the revolutionary masses and cadres also insisted on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works actively in the criticism.

The broad revolutionary masses and cadres of Shandong unanimously believe that to thoroughly overthrow the fallen dog of China's Khrushchev and to achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must further develop and consolidate the great alliance of revolution. They say: The handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road are most afraid of our great alliance of revolution and most hate our great unity, dreaming day and night of our revolutionary factions fighting endless "civil wars." Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." We proletarian revolutionaries must follow Chairman Mao's great teaching, use big principles to manage small principles, unite, and fight the enemy together. The leaders of the Shandong Revolutionary Workers' Rebel Headquarters, the Shandong Red Guards Headquarters, and the Shandong Revolutionary Cultural Rebel Headquarters recently held a joint meeting, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, through criticism and self-criticism, eliminated the estrangement among the three major organizations, further strengthened unity, and jointly formulated a decision to further strengthen unity and fight the enemy together, greatly enhancing the revolutionary fighting strength. At the critical moment of launching a general offensive against China's Khrushchev and his henchmen, the industrial, commercial, financial, educational, and youth systems throughout the province have recently established eleven major criticism liaison stations, concentrating all forces to fight against the revisionist black line of China's Khrushchev in various fields, launching a great exposure and struggle. In the countryside, at present, it is the busy season for field management. Many revolutionary cadres and members of the people's communes and production teams also use the rest time during field labor to carry out criticism in the fields.

The broad revolutionary masses of Heilongjiang are holding high the banner of Mao Zedong Thought for revolutionary criticism, closely combining it with the struggle, criticism, and transformation within their units, and launching an unprecedented large-scale criticism against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and their agents in Heilongjiang.

This criticism began with the criticism of China's Khrushchev's poisonous weed "On Cultivation" and his concocted part of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, "striking down a large number and protecting a few." This revolutionary criticism has played an important role in making the broad masses and cadres further recognize the ugly face of China's Khrushchev and in eliminating the poison of the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The broad revolutionary masses directed their struggle at this China's Khrushchev, helping a large number of erring cadres and deceived masses to free themselves from the poison of "On Cultivation" and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. Many originally opposing revolutionary mass organizations, through criticism, stopped their "civil wars," united to fight the enemy, and further improved the great alliance of revolution and the "three-in-one combination."

In the criticism, various places firmly grasped the line of struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, closely combining the criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation within their units. Starting from the criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, they took the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in their regions and units as "live targets," investigating the poison, digging out the roots, layer by layer, deeply, thoroughly exposing the class struggle cover in their regions, and systematically carrying out the criticism. In this way, the targets were clear, and the firepower was concentrated, digging deeper and deeper. The broad revolutionary masses in the countryside took the "four freedoms," "three selfs and one contract," "exploitation is reasonable," "the theory of the extinction of class struggle," "even if there are ten thousand rich peasants in the Northeast, it doesn't matter," and other reactionary fallacies of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road as the focus of criticism, combining with the actual situation in their localities, adopting methods such as investigating the poison from top to bottom and digging out the roots from bottom to top, thoroughly exposing the class struggle cover in their regions. Through the small, criticizing the big, through the near, criticizing the far, making the masses able to touch and see, thus, the more they criticized, the more they hated, making the criticism closely combined with the struggle between the two roads in their regions. The broad workers in the forest areas of Heilongjiang took up the thousand-catty hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticizing and exposing the various revisionist goods that China's Khrushchev had spread in the forest areas a few years ago under the pretext of "inspection," reforming various old systems and old frameworks, and ensuring that the forest areas advance along the socialist track. Various levels of schools, on the basis of the previous criticism, recently combined with the resumption of classes and the revolution, launched a high tide of thorough criticism of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and its backstage boss, China's Khrushchev.

In the criticism, various places studied and applied Chairman Mao's works actively, combining the magnificent revolutionary criticism movement with the solid movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works closely. This made the criticism movement have a clear guiding ideology and a fighting goal, have boundless power, and truly made the criticism movement a movement to smash the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, a movement to establish the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, and a movement to popularize Mao Zedong Thought.

    山东黑龙江广大城乡掀起波澜壮阔的革命大批判运动
    从政治思想理论上展开群众性大批判大斗争
    彻底打倒党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派
    据新华社济南二十日电　一场规模空前的革命大批判运动，正在山东广大城乡波澜壮阔地展开。全省广大工农兵、红卫兵、革命师生和革命干部，遵循伟大领袖毛主席“要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底”的教导，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，口诛笔伐，穷追猛打落水狗，决心把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派打个人仰马翻，把他们的一整套反革命修正主义货色砸个稀巴烂，把他们埋葬在人民战争的汪洋大海中，叫他们遗臭万年，永世不得翻身。
    山东广大革命派和革命群众，通过对中国的赫鲁晓夫和他的大毒草《修养》的一系列揭发批判，通过学习伟大的历史文件中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》，越来越深刻地认识到：搞好这场大批判，是我们在新形势下掌好权、用好权，巩固和加强无产阶级专政的重要关键，是关系到把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底还是半途而废的重大问题，是关系到中国革命的前途和整个人类命运的重大问题。毛主席教导我们：“在人类历史上，凡属将要灭亡的反动势力，总是要向革命势力进行最后挣扎的”。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在山东的代理人，虽然已落入人民战争的汪洋大海中，成了落水狗，但是，他们人还在，心不死，每时每刻都在妄图恢复他们失去的“天堂”。我们必须发扬痛打落水狗的彻底革命精神，“决不怜惜蛇一样的恶人”。对敌人的仁慈，就是对人民的残忍。把他们彻底批倒斗臭，这是一项具有伟大现实意义和深远历史意义的头等政治大事。
    为了把批判中国的赫鲁晓夫同批判山东党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派密切结合起来，七月五日，山东省革命委员会和中共济南部队委员会，分别发出了把大批判推向新高潮的通知，号召全省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众以及驻军全体指战员，全体民兵，立即紧急行动起来，在全省范围内把革命的大批判运动推向新高潮，把革命的大批判同省内的斗批改更加紧密地结合起来。
    山东广大无产阶级革命派从斗争中深刻地体会到，要打好这一仗，最根本、最关键的一条，就是活学活用毛主席著作，把群众性的大批判、大斗争，同大学习、大提高紧密结合起来。为了进一步掌握毛泽东思想这一强大武器，为了更深入、更广泛地开展大批判大斗争，山东省革命委员会常委，首先带头坚持天天学天天用毛主席著作，除每天学习一小时外，每周还专门抽出两个半天，以整风精神，集中进行学习。从省到许多地区、许多单位的革命派和革命群众，也坚持在大批判中活学活用毛主席著作。
    山东广大革命派和革命群众一致认为，要把中国的赫鲁晓夫这条落水狗彻底打倒，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，就必须进一步发展和巩固革命的大联合。他们说：党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，最怕我们的革命大联合，最恨我们的大团结，日夜梦想我们革命派无休止地打“内战”。毛主席教导我们：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”我们无产阶级革命派，必须遵照毛主席的这一伟大教导，用大道理管小道理，团结起来，同仇敌忾，一致对敌。山东革命工人造反总指挥部、红卫兵山东指挥部、红卫兵山东革命文艺造反司令部三大革命群众组织总部的负责人，最近专门举行联席会议，以毛泽东思想为武器，通过批评和自我批评，消除了三大组织之间的隔阂，进一步加强了团结，并且共同制定了关于进一步加强团结、共同对敌的决定，大大增强了革命的战斗力。在向中国的赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙发起总攻击的关键时刻，全省工交、财贸、教育、青年等系统，最近也先后建立了十一个大批判联络站，集中一切力量，向中国的赫鲁晓夫伸到各个领域的修正主义黑线，展开了大揭发、大斗争。在农村，当前正处于田间管理大忙季节。许多人民公社、生产队的广大革命干部和社员，也利用田间劳动休息时间，在田头搞大批判。
    据新华社哈尔滨二十日电　黑龙江省广大革命群众高举毛泽东思想的革命批判旗帜，紧密结合本单位的斗批改，对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其在黑龙江省的代理人，展开了空前规模的大批判。
    这场大批判，首先从批判中国的赫鲁晓夫的大毒草《修养》和他炮制的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分开始的。这个革命的大批判，对使广大群众和干部进一步认识到中国的赫鲁晓夫的丑恶面目，对于清除在无产阶级文化大革命中的资产阶级反动路线的流毒，起了重要的作用。广大革命群众把斗争的矛头对准这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，促使大批犯错误的干部和受蒙蔽的群众，从《修养》和资产阶级反动路线的毒害下解放出来。许多原来对立的革命群众组织，通过大批判，停止了“内战”，共同对敌，进一步搞好了革命的大联合和“三结合”。
    在大批判中，各地紧紧抓住两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争这个纲，把大批判和本单位的斗批改密切结合起来。从批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派入手，以本地区、本单位党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派为“活靶子”，查流毒、挖根子，层层深入，大揭本地区阶级斗争盖子，系统地进行批判。这样，目标明确，火力集中，越挖越深。农村广大革命群众以党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的“四大自由”、“三自一包”、“剥削有理”、“阶级斗争熄灭论”、“东北有一万富农党员也不怕”等反动谬论为批判的重点，结合本地实际情况，采取由上往下查流毒，由下往上挖根子等办法，大揭本地区阶级斗争盖子。通过小的，批判大的，通过近的，批判远的。使群众能够摸得着，看得见，从而，越批越恨，使大批判和本地区的两条道路斗争紧密地结合在一起。黑龙江省林区广大职工奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，大批大揭中国的赫鲁晓夫前几年以“视察”为名，在林区散布的种种修正主义货色，改革了各种旧制度、老框框，保证林区沿着社会主义的轨道前进。各级学校在前段批判的基础上，最近结合复课闹革命，又掀起一个全面彻底批判反革命修正主义教育路线及其总后台中国的赫鲁晓夫的高潮。
    各地在大批判中活学活用毛主席著作，在大批判中学，在大批判中用。把轰轰烈烈的革命大批判运动同扎扎实实的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动密切地结合起来，这就使大批判运动有了明确的指导思想和奋斗目标，有了无穷无尽的动力，从而真正使大批判运动成为大破资产阶级反动路线的运动，成为大立毛主席无产阶级革命路线的运动，成为毛泽东思想大普及的运动。
