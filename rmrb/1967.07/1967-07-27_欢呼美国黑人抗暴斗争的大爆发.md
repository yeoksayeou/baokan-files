The struggle of American Black people against the American reactionary ruling clique has erupted like a volcano.

On the 23rd, the Black masses in Detroit launched a large-scale armed struggle against the fascist police's suppression. Enraged Black people used Molotov cocktails and machine guns to bravely fight back, paralyzing the entire city of Detroit. In the eastern states of New York, Ohio, New Jersey, Maryland, and in the southern states of Texas and Arizona, as well as in many other cities, Black masses have also taken up arms to fight back. The flames of Black armed resistance are rapidly spreading across the country. In this situation, the American ruling clique has fallen into extreme chaos, exclaiming that this is the "most serious domestic crisis" in over a hundred years. The White House hastily dispatched more than 12,000 armed troops to Detroit, alongside more than 5,000 local police, to carry out brutal suppression.

Such a large-scale armed struggle by American Black people is rare in American history. The American ruling clique, in order to deal with the domestic people's revolutionary struggle, has never before deployed so many troops, and has never been so panic-stricken.

The great outbreak of the American Black people's anti-violence struggle reflects the unprecedented sharpening of class struggle within the United States. "National struggles, in the final analysis, are a class struggle." For a long time, American Black people have suffered the most brutal oppression and exploitation, placing them at the bottom of society, where suffering is the deepest, and thus harboring the greatest revolutionary force. The American reactionary ruling clique, in order to maintain their reactionary rule, has always used a cunning counter-revolutionary two-pronged strategy: on the one hand, adopting the most barbaric methods to suppress Black people's struggle against racial discrimination, and on the other hand, using various political deceptions such as the so-called "Civil Rights Act" to lull the fighting spirit of Black people. However, all of this is in vain, because the contradictions between American Black people and the reactionary ruling class are irreconcilable. As the broad masses of Black people become increasingly aware, their spirit of resistance and revolutionary sentiment are growing stronger. In the United States, there are powder kegs everywhere, ready to explode at any moment.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The various irreconcilable contradictions within and outside the country are like a volcano, threatening American imperialism every day. American imperialism is sitting on top of this volcano." The great outbreak of the American Black people's anti-violence struggle shows that the domestic rule of American imperialism, this gigantic entity, is also very weak; it is a paper tiger.

In various parts of the world, American imperialism is everywhere carrying out armed invasions, driving the people there to take up arms and embark on the path of armed struggle. In the United States, the reactionary ruling clique's violent suppression of Black people and other oppressed peoples will inevitably drive them to take up violent struggle. This is the law of class struggle. The struggle of Black people in Detroit has once again broken through the so-called "non-violent" dam, resolutely, consciously, and on a large scale, using revolutionary violence to resist counter-revolutionary violence. They are right to do so, and they have done well! To oppose American imperialism, one must take the path of violent struggle.

The flames ignited in Detroit are like a signal flare. It calls on the broad masses of American Black people to launch a new and more intense attack on the American ruling clique. It heralds the arrival of a fierce class struggle storm within the United States.

The armed anti-violence struggle of American Black people is an important part of the struggle of the American people against the monopoly capitalist clique, and it is also an important part of the struggle of the people of the world against American imperialism. The revolutionary peoples of the world, including the American people, uniting together, will surround American imperialism on all sides, and carry out an internal and external pincer attack, and will definitely bury this ferocious beast in the revolutionary torrent.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, in his statement of August 8, 1963, said: "I call on the workers, peasants, revolutionary intellectuals, enlightened bourgeois elements, and other enlightened individuals of all colors—white, black, yellow, brown, etc.—to unite and oppose American imperialism's racial discrimination, and support the struggle of American Black people against racial discrimination." Chairman Mao pointed out, "I am deeply convinced that, with the support of more than 90% of the people of the world, the just struggle of American Black people will certainly be victorious." This is the greatest encouragement to the struggle of American Black people.

Brave American Black people, fight even more resolutely! The Chinese people stand with you, and the revolutionary peoples of the world stand with you. The final victory will certainly be yours!

    欢呼美国黑人抗暴斗争的大爆发
    本报评论员
    美国黑人反对美国反动统治集团的斗争，象火山一样猛烈地爆发了。
    二十三日，底特律的黑人群众对法西斯警察的镇压，展开了大规模的武装抗暴斗争。愤怒的黑人使用燃烧瓶、机关枪，英勇战斗，使底特律全市陷于瘫痪。东部的纽约市、俄亥俄州、新泽西州、马里兰州，南部的得克萨斯州和亚利桑那州以及其他一些州的许多大小城市的黑人群众，也都纷纷拿起武器，进行斗争。黑人武装抗暴的烈火迅速向全国扩展。在这种局势下，美国统治集团已陷于极度的混乱，惊呼这是美国一百多年来“最严重的国内危机”。白宫匆忙地先后派了一万二千多名武装部队进驻底特律，配合当地的五千多名警察，进行疯狂的血腥镇压。
    美国黑人进行这样声势浩大的武装抗暴斗争，在美国历史上是罕见的。美国统治集团为了对付国内人民的革命斗争而出动这么多的军队，惊慌失措到这样的地步，也是从未有过的。
    美国黑人抗暴斗争的大爆发，反映了美国国内阶级斗争的空前尖锐化。“民族斗争，说到底，是一个阶级斗争问题。”长期以来，美国黑人遭受着最残酷的压迫和剥削，他们处于社会的最底层，苦难最深重，因而也就蕴藏着最巨大的革命力量。美国反动统治集团为了维持他们的反动统治，一直采取阴险的反革命两手策略，一方面采取最野蛮的手段镇压黑人反对种族歧视的斗争，另一方面则竭力利用所谓“民权法”等种种政治欺骗的把戏来麻痹黑人的斗志。但是，所有这一切都是徒劳的，因为美国黑人同反动统治阶级之间的矛盾是不可调和的。随着广大黑人群众的日益觉醒，他们的反抗精神和革命情绪越来越增强。在美国各处都布满了火药桶，一触即发。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席曾经指出：“国内国外的各种不可调和的矛盾，就象一座火山，每天都在威胁美国帝国主义，美国帝国主义就是坐在这座火山上。”美国黑人抗暴斗争的大爆发，说明美帝国主义这个庞然大物在国内的统治也是十分虚弱的，它是不折不扣的纸老虎。
    在世界各地，美帝国主义到处进行武装侵略，也就驱使那里的人民拿起武器，走上武装斗争的道路。在美国国内，反动统治集团对黑人和其他被压迫人民的暴力镇压，也必然要驱使他们走上暴力斗争的道路。这是阶级斗争的规律。底特律黑人的斗争，又一次冲破了所谓“非暴力主义”的堤坝，坚决地、自觉地、大规模地用革命暴力反抗反革命暴力。他们干得对，干得好！要反对美帝国主义，就得采取暴力斗争的道路。
    从底特律点燃起来的烈火，好比一颗信号弹。它号召美国广大黑人向美国统治集团发动一场新的更加猛烈的进攻。它预示着美国国内一场激烈的阶级斗争风暴的来临。
    美国黑人武装抗暴斗争，是美国人民反对垄断集团的斗争的一个重要部分，也是全世界人民反对美帝国主义的斗争的一个重要部分。包括美国人民在内的全世界革命人民联合起来，把美帝国主义重重包围起来，对美帝国主义实行内外夹攻，就一定可以把这只凶恶的野兽埋葬于革命的怒涛之中。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席早在一九六三年八月八日发表的声明中说：“我呼吁，全世界白色、黑色、黄色、棕色等各色人种中的工人、农民、革命的知识分子、开明的资产阶级分子和其他开明人士联合起来，反对美国帝国主义的种族歧视，支持美国黑人反对种族歧视的斗争。”毛主席指出，“我深信，在全世界百分之九十以上的人民的支持下，美国黑人的正义斗争是一定要胜利的。”这是对美国黑人斗争的最大的鼓舞。
    英勇的美国黑人，更加坚决地战斗吧！中国人民站在你们一边，全世界革命人民站在你们一边，最后胜利一定是属于你们的！
