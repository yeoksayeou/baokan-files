More than 12,000 compatriots from Macau held a rally and demonstration on July 24 to support the struggle of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots against British oppression. The event strongly condemned the fascist atrocities of British imperialism in Hong Kong and resolutely supported the anti-British struggle of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon.

The rally was held at the Macau Workers' Sports Stadium. The chairman of the rally said in his speech that over the past two months, Hong Kong compatriots armed with Mao Zedong Thought have fearlessly risen up against the brutal persecution of British imperialism, dealing a heavy blow to the fascist reactionary rule of the British in Hong Kong.

He said, "Hong Kong and Macau compatriots are brothers. We must mobilize all our forces to resolutely support the anti-British struggle of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon. We will not rest until we achieve complete victory!"

Following this, a resident representative read a letter to the residents of Hong Kong and Kowloon. After the rally, a grand demonstration march was held.

To support the anti-British struggle of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, the Macau Compatriots Support Committee for the Struggle Against British Oppression in Hong Kong and Kowloon has been organizing a seven-day anti-British struggle art performance at the Yongle Theater in Macau since July 22. The performance featured numerous art programs promoting Mao Zedong Thought and reflecting the anti-British struggle of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, which were warmly received by the Macau compatriots.
