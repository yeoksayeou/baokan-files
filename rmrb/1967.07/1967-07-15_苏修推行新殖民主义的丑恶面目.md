The Soviet revisionist leadership has always boasted about their "aid" to underdeveloped countries. In reality, they use "aid" as a cover for great-power chauvinism and national selfishness. An African independent nation has dealt with the Soviet revisionists for six or seven years and has had enough of Soviet economic "aid." The living facts have made people recognize the ugly nature of Soviet revisionism.

One day, a reporter met an African engineer who had worked with Soviet "expert" geologists for a long time. When talking about the behavior of the so-called Soviet "experts" in Africa, he angrily said, "The Soviet experts have been here for five years, claiming to find oil, gold, and diamonds for us. But what results have they produced? Nothing!"

This engineer said, "Today, in Lenin's homeland, the leaders there have long betrayed the people and have long parted ways with Marxism!" "The Soviet experts here are no exception," he continued. "They are only concerned with whether they have comfortable living conditions." At this point, the friend drew a vivid conclusion, exposing the essence of Soviet revisionist nationalism, saying, "How can they find any minerals like this?" He then firmly stated, "I have seen through it all. They never intended to find oil for us. The Soviet Union is an oil-producing country. If we had oil, would we still buy theirs?"

This friend loves to read Chairman Mao's works. At this time, he recited a passage from Chairman Mao's quotations: "The October Revolution sent us Marxism-Leninism." He then laughed heartily and said, "Chairman Mao personally initiated and led the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. Now Mao Zedong Thought has spread throughout the world and has also reached the Soviet people. This is the dialectic of history."

In the capital of this country, people talk about a "construction site that will never be completed" - a sports field built with Soviet "aid." This was the first construction project built in this country after it gained independence in 1960, and it has been five years, but it is still not completed.

One day, the reporter met a local technician who had worked on that construction site for two years. This friend, unable to bear the stench of the Soviet "experts," had resigned in anger. He told the reporter, "Although I have not yet found a steady job, it is still better than being with those who call us comrades with their mouths but harbor black hearts."

He said, "Building a sports field is not a big technical secret, but these Soviet experts keep technical issues secret from us. In fact, these so-called experts are not very skilled. There was a self-proclaimed engineer from the Soviet Union who, upon arriving at the construction site, couldn't even understand the blueprints!" This friend said that the original plan for this sports field was to invest 800 million of our country's currency, but by now, 13 billion has been spent, and it still cannot be completed.

Before this, the reporter had heard that during the construction of this sports field, the Soviet revisionists proposed sending two "experts" to help plant grass. This proposal sparked a lot of discussion, and many people indignantly said, "Do we not know how to plant grass? This is sheer new colonialism."

This country's civil aviation company is one of the projects "aided" by the Soviet Union. The planes are sold to us by the Soviet Union in the form of loans, and the pilots are mainly Soviet people, but this company is a money-losing company every year. According to an employee of this aviation company, the main reason for the losses is: high salaries in dollars have to be paid to Soviet pilots, planes have to be frequently sent to Moscow for maintenance, and spare parts and repair fees are expensive.

A friend commented on this "aid," saying, "On the surface, they give you some 'aid,' but in the end, the money rolls back into their own pockets. This is not 'aid,' this is a highly profitable business."

One night, a car was speeding recklessly down a street in the capital, swerving like it was dancing, sometimes veering to the left, sometimes to the right. A young African boy walking by the road was knocked down, instantly covered in blood and unconscious. The police immediately blew their whistles to stop the car, but the driver did not pay any attention and instead sped up to try to escape, later crashing into a tree before stopping. The police caught a drunk man from the car, who turned out to be a Soviet "teacher" teaching here. The police questioned him about why he did not stop after hitting someone, and this guy, just like an American, played dumb, shouting drunkenly, "I did not hit anyone..." However, the facts were clear, and this Soviet person tried to deny it but could not. He was finally taken to the police station by the police.

The next morning, the Soviet ambassador in charge personally visited the police station and shamelessly threatened that the wife of this Soviet "teacher" had fainted due to her husband being detained, and for "humanitarian" reasons, demanded that the police authorities give him "temporary" freedom. But this ambassador, who spoke so much about "humanity," did not care at all about the life or death of the injured African boy. Soon after, the Soviet revisionist "teacher" who caused the accident was released by the Soviet embassy and returned to Moscow.

A magazine in this country recently published a letter from a reader exposing that, "The Soviets are not promoting 'down with racism,' are they? However, a Soviet person in a certain place in this country, when riding a taxi with nine seats, paid for the other eight seats, occupying the entire car alone, just to avoid sitting with 'black people' in the same car. This is thought-provoking."

A high-ranking official said: When he visited Moscow, he stayed in the largest hotel. White Americans were treated with great hospitality, while Africans, despite being called "guests of honor," were treated coldly. This official said that as soon as he entered the hotel, he locked himself in his room to avoid the oppressive, disgusting gazes.

From the behavior of Soviet personnel abroad, many African friends have further seen that this is just a microcosm of the full-scale restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union.

### 苏修推行新殖民主义的丑恶面目

    苏修推行新殖民主义的丑恶面目
    苏联修正主义领导集团一贯吹嘘他们“援助”不发达国家，实际上他们以“援助”为名，行大国沙文主义、民族利己主义之实。非洲一个民族独立国家同苏修打了六、七年交道，尝够苏联经济“援助”的苦头，活生生的事实，使人们认识了苏联修正主义的丑恶本质。
    有一天，记者遇见一位同苏联勘探“专家”一起工作了很久的非洲工程师。在谈到所谓的苏联“专家”在非洲的行径时，他气愤地说：“苏联专家来到这里已有五年了，说是给我们找石油，找黄金，找钻石。可是到现在有什么结果呢？一个大零！”
    这位工程师说：“今天，在列宁的故乡，那里的领导人早已背离了人民群众，也早已同马克思主义告别了！”“我们这里的苏联专家也不例外”，“他们关心的是有没有舒服的生活条件”。谈到这里，这位朋友画龙点睛地揭穿了苏修民族利己主义的本质，他说：“你想，这样怎能找到矿？！”接着，他肯定地说：“我早看透了，他们压根儿就不想给我们找石油，苏联是生产石油的国家，如果我们有了石油，还能买他们的吗？”
    这位朋友很爱读毛主席著作，这时，他背了一段毛主席语录：“十月革命一声炮响，给我们送来了马克思列宁主义。”接着又爽朗地笑着说：“毛主席亲自发动和领导了中国的无产阶级文化大革命，现在毛泽东思想已传遍全世界，也传给了苏联人民，这也是历史的辩证法。”
    在这个国家的首都，人们传说有一个“永远完不了工的工地”——苏联“援建”的运动场。这是这个国家一九六○年独立后兴建的第一项建筑工程，至今已五年了，还没有完工。
    一天，记者遇见了曾在那个工地上工作了两年的一位本地技术人员。这位朋友由于受不了苏联“专家”的腌臜气早已愤而辞职了。他向记者说：“现在我虽然还没有找到固定的工作，但总比同那些嘴里称呼同志，胸腔里窝藏黑心的人在一起要好得多。”
    他说：“本来修建一个运动场没有什么了不起的技术秘密，可是这些苏联专家一研究什么技术问题就对我们保密。其实他们这些所谓专家也没有多大本事，有一个自称工程师的苏联人，到了工地，连图纸也看不懂哩！”这位朋友说，这座运动场原计划投资我国货币八亿，可是到现在已花去十三亿多，却仍然不能竣工。
    在这以前，记者曾听说，在修建这座运动场的过程中，苏修提出建议，要派两个“专家”来，帮助在运动场种草皮。这个建议引起了纷纷议论，许多人愤慨地说：“我们难道连草皮也不会种吗，简直是新殖民主义者。”
    这个国家的民用航空公司是苏联的“援助”项目之一，飞机是苏联以贷款形式卖给的，航空员主要由苏联人充当，而这个公司却是一个每年赔钱的公司。据这个民航公司的一位工作人员分析，赔钱的主要原因是：要以美元付给苏联航空员高额工资，飞机要经常到莫斯科检修，零件和修理收费昂贵。
    一位朋友在评论这种“援助”时说：“表面上他给你一些‘援助’，实际上钱又滚到他们自己的腰包，这不是什么‘援助’，这是一本万利的生意。”
    一天夜里，一辆汽车在首都大街上横冲直撞地飞驰，汽车象在跳扭摆舞，一会儿冲到路左边，一会儿撞到路右边。一个在路旁行走的非洲少年给撞倒了，顿时血流满面昏迷不醒。警察立刻吹哨叫停车，开车人毫不理睬，却加快速度想溜之大吉，后来又撞在一棵树上才停了下来。警察从汽车里逮住了一个喝得醉醺醺的人，原来他是在这里“教书”的一个苏联“教员”。警察质问他撞了人为什么不停车，这个家伙简直跟美国佬一样地耍无赖，醉醺醺地叫喊：“我没有撞到任何人……”。但是事实俱在，这个苏联人想赖也赖不掉，最后被警察押送到警察局去了。
    第二天早上，苏联驻这里的大使亲临警察所，竟恬不知耻地威胁说什么这个苏联“教员”的夫人，因她丈夫被押而吓得昏了过去，出于“人道”的原因，要求警察当局给他以“临时”自由。但这位满口“人道”的大使，对被撞坏了的非洲少年的死活根本置之不理。不久以后，那个撞人的苏修“教员”在苏修大使馆保释下回到了莫斯科。
    这里一家杂志最近发表了一封读者来信揭发说：“苏联人不是在宣传‘打倒种族主义’吗？然而一个苏联人在这个国家某地乘坐有九个座位的出租汽车时，竟付了其他八个座位的票钱，一人独占一辆车，为的是不同‘黑人’同坐在一辆车上，这是令人深思的事情。”
    一位高级官员说：当他到莫斯科访问时，住在一家最大的旅馆里。美国白人被招待得殷勤周到，而对待非洲人，尽管口称为“贵宾”，也是冷眼相待。这位官员说，他一进旅馆就把自己关在房间里，以避开那种四面逼来的、令人厌恶的目光。
    从苏修在国外人员的所作所为中，今天许多非洲朋友已进一步看清楚这只不过是苏联国内资本主义全面复辟的一个缩影罢了。
