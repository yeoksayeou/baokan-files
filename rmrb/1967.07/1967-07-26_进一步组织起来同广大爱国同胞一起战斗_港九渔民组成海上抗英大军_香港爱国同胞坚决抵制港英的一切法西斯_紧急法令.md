In the midst of the new high tide of the struggle against British imperialism and violence by Hong Kong compatriots, the fishermen of Hong Kong, Kowloon, and the "New Territories" have further organized themselves, achieved great unity, and established a unified "Hong Kong and Kowloon Fishermen's Anti-British Oppression Struggle Committee," determined to carry the struggle against British imperialism and violence to the end.

On the 22nd, this struggle committee was announced, and a declaration was issued, calling on fishermen brothers who have long suffered from the brutal exploitation and oppression of British imperialism to raise the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought even higher, join the battle, and thoroughly settle the blood debt of British imperialism over more than a hundred years, avenging the fallen compatriots.

The declaration states: The evil British imperialists have recently even dispatched British troops to raid and suppress our patriotic unions, schools, theaters, banks, national goods companies, and patriotic compatriots in a bandit-like manner. The fishermen brothers of Hong Kong and Kowloon have long suffered discrimination and humiliation from the British colonialists, the exploitation of the "Fishery Market" and "Marine Department," and the plunder of various taxes, making our ancestors live in a world of suffering. These debts, we must demand, and these humiliations, we must avenge. We must take immediate action, form a vast army on the sea, and respond and support the general strike of workers in various industries with actual actions.

The declaration states: The struggle of Hong Kong compatriots against British imperialism and violence is a struggle to defend the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, and it is also a struggle between aggression and anti-aggression. Every Chinese with hot blood must stand up and make their contribution. We must settle the accounts of more than a hundred years of British oppression and humiliation of our fishermen, avenging the ancestors of the fishermen. We must unite with the broad masses of patriotic compatriots, fight together, and win together. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "With firm determination, fearing no sacrifice, and overcoming all difficulties, we will strive for victory." We swear to fight and expose the British imperialists! We will not rest until we achieve complete victory.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 24th: In a desperate attempt to save itself, the British fascist authorities recently announced a series of "emergency ordinances," attempting to extinguish the raging flames of anti-violence resistance. However, the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong responded with a resounding voice: We only follow the principle of "patriotism is not a crime, resistance to violence is justified," and all fascist ordinances of the British are ineffective against us!

The British fascist authorities announced more than ten "emergency ordinances" on the 20th and 22nd. These so-called "ordinances" stipulate that patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong are not allowed to expose their heinous crimes, nor are they allowed to propagate the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, as this "may cause" the British to feel "fear and despair." The "ordinances" also stipulate that British military and police can break into houses and arrest people at any time, have the "power to seal off buildings"; patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong are not allowed to accuse and protest against the British, have the "power to prohibit private and public meetings"; British military and police can arbitrarily stop and abduct pedestrians, have the "power to inquire about the names and identities of pedestrians"; the British can arbitrarily judge and frame charges, "have the power to order criminal trials without public attendance," and so on. In short, the British fascist authorities have all the "powers," and the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong have all the "crimes," allowing the officials to set fires while prohibiting the people from lighting lamps.

In response to these fascist "emergency ordinances" by the British authorities, a spokesperson for the Hong Kong and Kowloon Anti-British Oppression Struggle Committee of various circles issued a statement on the evening of the 23rd, solemnly declaring: "All the 'emergency ordinances' issued by the British fascist authorities in the past and present, no matter how many there are, whether ten or dozens, are all invalid. We despise them and do not acknowledge them. The patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong only follow one principle: patriotism is not a crime, resistance to violence is justified."

The spokesperson said that the British fascist authorities' paper tiger nature of being strong on the outside but weak on the inside has been increasingly exposed. But they are still trying to use fascist ordinances and violence to save their failing situation. Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "It is impossible to hope that imperialists and Chinese reactionaries will have a change of heart and turn back. The only way is to organize forces and fight against them..." We must counterattack and not give an inch. The enemy issues various "emergency ordinances," and we will respond with various forms of struggle. The spokesperson finally said: "We are full of confidence in victory. If the British dare to continue to challenge the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and the 700 million people of our motherland, we will definitely accompany them to the end."

    进一步组织起来同广大爱国同胞一起战斗
    港九渔民组成海上抗英大军
    香港爱国同胞坚决抵制港英的一切法西斯“紧急法令”
    据新华社香港二十四日电　在香港同胞反英抗暴斗争进入新高潮的时候，香港、九龙和“新界”的渔民进一步组织起来，实现大联合，成立了统一的“港九渔民反对港英迫害斗争委员会”，决心把反英抗暴斗争进行到底。
    二十二日，这个斗委会宣告成立，并发表了宣言，号召长期遭受港英帝国主义残酷剥削和压迫的渔民兄弟更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，投入战斗，坚决、彻底地清算英帝国主义百多年来的血债，为死难的同胞报仇。
    宣言说：万恶的英帝国主义最近竟出动英军，对我爱国工会、学校、戏院、银行、国货公司和爱国同胞进行强盗式的抢劫和镇压。港九渔民兄弟长期以来遭到港英殖民主义者的歧视和欺侮，港英“渔市场”和“海事处”的剥削，苛捐杂税的掠夺，使我们祖祖辈辈都生活在水深火热中。这些债，我们要讨，这些耻辱我们要雪。我们要立即行动起来，组成千军万马的海上大军，用实际行动来响应和支持各业工人的大罢工。
    宣言说：香港同胞的反英抗暴斗争是一场捍卫光焰无际的毛泽东思想的斗争，也是一场侵略与反侵略的斗争，每一个有热血的中华儿女都要挺身而出，作出自己的贡献。我们一定要清算百多年来港英对我们渔民的欺凌和压迫，为祖祖辈辈的渔民报仇雪耻。我们一定要和广大的爱国同胞团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。我们要牢记毛主席的教导：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”誓把港英斗垮、斗臭！不获全胜，决不罢休。
    据新华社香港二十四日电　港英法西斯当局为了垂死挣扎，最近宣布了一连串的“紧急法令”，妄图扑灭势成燎原的抗暴烈火。但是香港爱国同胞以响亮的声音回答：我们只奉行“爱国无罪，抗暴有理”这一条，港英的一切法西斯法令对我们一律无效！
    港英法西斯当局在二十日和二十二日，连续宣布了十多条“紧急法令”。这些所谓“法令”规定，不准香港爱国同胞揭露它们的滔天罪行，不准宣传光焰无际的毛泽东思想，因为这“可能引起”港英的“恐惧与沮丧”。“法令”还规定，港英军警可随时破门进屋抓人，有“封闭楼宇的权力”；不准香港爱国同胞控诉和抗议港英，有“禁止举行私人及公开会议的权力”；港英军警可随便截查和绑架行人，有“查询行人姓名身份的权力”；港英可胡乱审判，强加罪名，“有权命令举行刑事审讯时禁止民众旁听”等等。总之一句话，港英法西斯当局什么都有“权”，香港爱国同胞什么都有“罪”，“只许州官放火，不准百姓点灯”。
    针对港英当局这些法西斯“紧急法令”，港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会发言人二十三日晚上发表谈话，严正宣布：“港英法西斯当局过去和现在所颁布的一切‘紧急法令’，不管你有几条，或者几十条，统统无效，我们就是蔑视它，就是不把它放在眼内，香港爱国同胞只奉行一条：爱国无罪，抗暴有理。”
    发言人说，港英法西斯当局外强中干、色厉内茬的纸老虎本质，已越来越被人们看穿了。但它目前仍妄图用法西斯法令和暴力镇压来挽救败局。我们伟大的领袖毛主席指出：“希望劝说帝国主义者和中国反动派发出善心，回头是岸，是不可能的。唯一的办法是组织力量和他们斗争……”。我们必须针锋相对，寸步不让。敌人颁布各种“紧急法令”，我们就用各种斗争形式加以反击。发言人最后说：“我们充满了必胜的信心，港英如敢同我香港爱国同胞和祖国七亿人民较量下去，我们就坚决奉陪到底。”
