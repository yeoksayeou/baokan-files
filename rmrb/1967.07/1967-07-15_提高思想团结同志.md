How should the proletarian revolutionary faction correctly handle contradictions within the people? Should we do work to unite the masses? On this issue, we have gone through a tortuous process of understanding.

Can coercion solve problems?

In January, our proletarian revolutionary faction seized power from the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party in our factory. However, the comrades who participated in the conservative organization and were deceived did not stop their activities. Since they could not gain the upper hand in the factory, they desperately went outside the factory to find organizations to align with, attempting to use external forces to continue opposing us. Initially, we adopted a tit-for-tat approach: wherever they aligned, we would expose them and dismantle their stage. Once the stage was dismantled, we felt especially happy, thinking that this was a victory.

However, the comrades who participated in the conservative organization and were deceived did not stop there. We dismantled their stage here, and they went elsewhere to continue their activities, making it impossible for us to dismantle all their stages. With no other option, we ordered them to disband within a deadline. As a result, the antagonism between both sides grew even stronger.

Was the method of dismantling stages and ordering disbandment correct? Could it solve problems? With these questions in mind, we studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao taught us: "Regarding the shortcomings of the people, criticism is needed, ... but one must truly stand on the side of the people, speaking with the fervor of protecting and educating the people. If one treats comrades as enemies, then one has stood on the side of the enemy." Those who participated in the conservative organization are not our enemies but our class brothers, our comrades. In the past, we did not correctly distinguish between the two types of contradictions and actually treated them as enemies, thus adopting the wrong methods.

Chairman Mao said: "All issues of an ideological nature, all issues of contention within the people, can only be resolved through democratic methods, only through methods of discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education, and cannot be resolved through coercive and overpowering methods." This is exactly the case. The methods of dismantling stages and ordering disbandment are coercive and overpowering. It seemed that the problem was solved and victory was achieved in the short term, but in reality, "not only will it not be effective, but it will be extremely harmful." Because we did not use the method of presenting facts and reasoning to engage in debate, clarify right from wrong, and do in-depth and detailed ideological work, it was impossible to raise the awareness of the deceived comrades and truly bring them back to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Without raising the ideological awareness of the deceived comrades, relying solely on coercive methods to overpower them, the result was that the greater the pressure, the stronger their antagonism towards us. This way of doing things actually let the real enemies off the hook, and production tasks for the country were also affected, which was exactly what the enemies wanted. After analyzing this, everyone felt that dismantling their stages and disbanding their organizations was not a victory; only by helping the deceived comrades raise their class consciousness and uniting the vast majority of the masses under the banner of Mao Zedong Thought was a true victory. We decided to listen to Chairman Mao's words, correct our attitude towards the deceived comrades, and help them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

What is the "temperament" of the revolutionary faction?

Thus, we mobilized all the Red Guards to actively and enthusiastically approach some of the deceived comrades and do in-depth and detailed ideological work. Due to long-term ideological opposition, it was initially very difficult. Once, a member of the Red Guards went to talk to a comrade, but before he could say a few words, the other person stuffed straw into his pocket and said, "You came here to pick straw, didn't you!" He was so angry that he turned around and left, muttering, "You are wrong, helping you, and you don't admit it, this is unreasonable!" Some comrades' thoughts were not very clear, and after encountering a few rebuffs, they were filled with resentment, saying, "Do we have to be so humble, be such a softie? We won't do it. This is not the temperament of our revolutionary faction."

What is the temperament of the revolutionary faction? Is it being patient in doing ideological work that makes one a "softie" or "humble"? We studied Chairman Mao's works again with this question in mind. Chairman Mao said: "Serve the people wholeheartedly, never leave the masses; everything should be based on the interests of the people, not on personal or small group interests." According to Chairman Mao's teachings, everyone realized: our help to the deceived comrades has only one starting point, which is to propagate and defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, unite more comrades to stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat to the end. For the sake of the revolution, we are not afraid of being surrounded, not afraid of being persecuted, not afraid of being labeled as "counter-revolutionaries," so why should we be afraid of encountering a few setbacks and not being able to bear a few sarcastic remarks? Our revolutionary faction's class feelings are very clear: "Be harsh to the enemy, be lenient to ourselves." Towards the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, we must expose them one by one, knock them down to the ground, and stomp on them with one foot, so that they can never rise again; towards comrades who have made mistakes or been deceived, we must help them with deep class feelings, be very sincere and very patient, and persuade them. This is not being a "softie" or "humble," but rather, it precisely shows the greatness of mind that proletarian revolutionary fighters should have, precisely indicating that we are true proletarian revolutionaries.

With this understanding, the Red Guards actively and consciously went to workshops and dormitories to do more ideological work, and extensively launched heart-to-heart talks throughout the factory. A young female worker once went to talk to an old worker, but the first time she wasn't even allowed in the door, the second time she was turned away by the old worker's wife. She did not give up, and on the third and fourth attempts, she asked the worker to criticize her and the Red Guards, and used the method of presenting facts and reasoning to expose the slander and defamation of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party against the Red Guards. This worker gradually changed, and now he has joined the ranks of the Red Guards.

Through painstaking and detailed ideological work, the situation quickly changed. Many deceived comrades awakened. An old worker said: "In the past, whenever I heard someone call me a 'royalist,' I felt uncomfortable in my heart and could not calmly face myself. I originally wanted to make a revolution, to defend Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee. Now I know I was deceived and fooled by the enemy."

Through this period of work, we deeply felt: if we say what the temperament of the revolutionary faction is, it is: read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions in every detail and every action. How Chairman Mao says, we do it that way, this is the temperament of our revolutionary faction.

How to truly grasp leadership?

When our Red Guards had just seized power, the comrades who participated in the conservative organization and were deceived did not acknowledge us and always wanted to smash us. We slept and ate in the office, guarding the seals we had seized. Soon, the power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party who were behind the scenes directing the conservative organization were exposed, and the comrades from the PLA Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team publicly expressed their support for us. With this, some comrades thought: our "power" was firmly in our hands, and there were no more problems. Thus, they became complacent in their thoughts and were not as strict with their own demands, speaking arrogantly and wanting to use "power" to suppress others.

What is leadership power, and how can we truly grasp it? Regarding this issue, we studied the highest directives. Chairman Mao said: "What is meant by leadership power is not to shout it as a slogan every day, nor to suppress others arrogantly and demand that they obey us, but to persuade and educate non-party people with the party's correct policies and our model work, so that they are willing to accept our suggestions." Chairman Mao's teachings opened our minds. We realized: what is meant by leadership power is definitely not a few seals, nor is it the surface obedience of the masses to us. Only by firmly acting according to Mao Zedong Thought, correctly implementing the party's policies, working as models, and influencing the masses with our actions, can we achieve correct leadership and say that we have truly grasped power. Otherwise, this power is empty and not solid.

With a clear understanding, we Red Guards decided to open the door for rectification, publicly examine our shortcomings and mistakes, and seriously listen to the criticisms and opinions of the masses. During the rectification, the broad masses affirmed that our general direction was correct and also put forward many opinions, pointing out some of our shortcomings and mistakes. We highly valued the criticisms and opinions raised by the masses, and even if the comrades who participated in the conservative organization and were deceived raised issues to us, we treated them seriously. We publicly examined the mistakes of some comrades in the two-faction struggle. Someone pointed out that the Red Guards had cars for going out, so we proposed to be thrifty in making the revolution, and in the future, unless it was a factory-wide activity, we would not take cars. For matters that needed to be explained, we clarified the situation; for matters that were not yet clear, we set up special teams to study and resolve them. In short, we did our best to give an account of the opinions raised by the masses. This way, the broad masses were quite satisfied. An old worker said: "Young people making mistakes is inevitable, but changing is good, this is what a true revolutionary faction should be like."

Based on the issues raised during the rectification, we Red Guards further strictly demanded of ourselves. In the aspect of grasping the revolution and promoting production, we also strove to set a model. If meetings delayed production, we made up the time, and we would never let the national interests suffer losses.

After the rectification, the prestige of the Red Guards among the masses was not lowered but even higher. Our leadership power was not weakened but more solidified. Now, the vast majority of the masses are united on the side of Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and the factory has shown a great situation of revolutionary unification.

    提高思想团结同志
    华北金属结构厂红色造反者
    无产阶级革命派怎样正确处理人民内部的矛盾？要不要做团结群众的工作？在这个问题上，我们经历了一个曲折的认识过程。
    靠压服能解决问题吗？
    一月份，我们无产阶级革命派夺了厂里党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权。但是，参加保守组织受蒙蔽的同志并没有停止活动。他们在厂里占不了优势，就拚命到厂外活动，到处找一些组织挂钩，企图借着外边的力量，继续和我们对抗。对他们这种活动，我们起初采取了针锋相对的办法：他们在那里挂钩，我们就在那里揭他们的底，拆他们的台。台拆成了，我们心里特别高兴，认为这样就算胜利了。
    但是，参加保守组织受蒙蔽的同志并不就此罢休。这里拆了他们的台，他们又上别处去活动，弄得我们拆不胜拆。没办法，我们就勒令他们限期解散。结果，双方的对立情绪越来越大。
    这种拆台、勒令解散的办法对不对呢？能不能解决问题呢？带着这些问题，我们学习了毛主席著作。毛主席教导我们：“对于人民的缺点是需要批评的，……但必须是真正站在人民的立场上，用保护人民、教育人民的满腔热情来说话。如果把同志当作敌人来对待，就是使自己站在敌人的立场上去了。”那些参加保守组织的群众，不是我们的敌人，而是我们的阶级兄弟，是我们的同志。过去，我们正是没有正确地区分两类不同性质的矛盾，实际上把他们当作敌人来对待，因而采取的方法也就错了。
    毛主席说：“凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。”事情正是这样。拆台、勒令解散的办法，都是强制、压服的办法。看起来一时似乎解决了问题，取得了胜利，实际上，“不但不会收效，而且非常有害。”因为没有运用摆事实、讲道理的方法来展开辩论，分清是非，没有做深入细致的思想工作，就不可能使受蒙蔽的同志提高认识，真正回到毛主席的革命路线上来。没有提高受蒙蔽同志的思想认识，单靠强制的办法去压服，结果是压力越大，他们和我们的对立情绪越严重。这样做，反倒把真正的敌人放在一边，国家生产任务也受到影响，这正好是敌人高兴的事。这样一分析，大家感到，拆了他们的台，解散了他们的组织，并不是什么胜利；只有帮助受蒙蔽的同志提高了阶级觉悟，把绝大多数群众团结到毛泽东思想的旗帜下，才是真正的胜利。我们决心听毛主席的话，端正对受蒙蔽的同志的态度，帮助他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    什么是造反派的“脾气”？
    这样，我们就发动全体红色造反者主动地热情地去接近一些受蒙蔽的同志，做深入细致的思想工作。由于长期造成了思想对立，开始很不顺利。有一次，一个红色造反队员去找一个同志谈心，还没说上几句，对方就往他口袋里塞稻草，说：“你上这儿捞稻草来啦！”他气得扭头就走，边走边嘀咕：“你们错了，帮助你，还不认错，真是岂有此理！”有的同志本来思想就不怎么通，碰了几次钉子，憋了一肚子气，说：“要我们低三下四，当这样的软骨头，不干。这不是我们造反派的脾气。”
    什么是造反派的脾气？耐心地做思想工作，是不是就是“低三下四”？就是“软骨头”？我们又带着这个问题，学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众；一切从人民的利益出发，而不是从个人或小集团的利益出发”。按照毛主席的教导，大家认识到：我们帮助受蒙蔽的同志，出发点只有一个，就是为了宣传和保卫毛主席的革命路线，团结更多的同志站到毛主席的革命路线上来，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。为了革命的利益，我们不怕围攻，不怕迫害，不怕被打成“反革命”，难道还怕碰几个钉子，听不得几句讽刺话？我们革命派的阶级感情是十分鲜明的：“对敌狠，对己和”。对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，我们要把他们一个个揪出来，打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，让他们永世不得翻身；对于犯了错误，或者受了蒙蔽的同志，就要带着深厚的阶级感情，非常诚恳、非常耐心地帮助他，说服他。这决不是什么“软骨头”、“低三下四”，相反地，恰恰表现了我们无产阶级革命战士应有的伟大胸怀，恰恰说明我们是真正的无产阶级革命派。
    认识提高了，红色造反者就深入到班组、宿舍，更加主动、更加自觉地去做思想工作，在全厂广泛地开展了谈心活动。有一个青年女工找一位老师傅谈心，第一次连门也没有让她进去，第二次去，又被那位老师傅的爱人顶了回来。她没有灰心，第三次、第四次再去，请师傅对她和红色造反者提意见，并且用摆事实、讲道理的办法，揭穿了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派对红色造反者的造谣诬蔑。这位师傅逐步地转变了，现在他已经参加了红色造反者的队伍。
    经过艰苦细致的思想工作，情况很快有了变化。很多受蒙蔽的同志觉醒过来了。一位老工人说：“我过去一听到有人叫我是‘保皇派’，从心眼里不舒服，也就不能冷静地对待自己。我原来也是要革命的，要保卫毛主席，保卫党中央。现在才知道受了蒙蔽，上了敌人的当。”
    经过这一段工作，我们深深体会到：如果说什么是造反派的脾气，那就是：读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，一点一滴、一言一行都按毛主席的指示办事，毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做，这才是我们革命造反派的脾气。
    怎样才能真正掌握领导权？
    我们红色造反者刚刚夺了权的时候，参加保守组织受蒙蔽的同志不承认我们，总想来砸。我们就吃睡在办公室，守住夺来的大印。不久，幕后指挥保守组织的走资本主义道路当权派被揪出来了，解放军毛泽东思想宣传队的同志，公开表示支持我们。这一来，有的同志就认为：我们的“权”算掌定了，再也没有什么问题了。于是，思想上就松懈起来，对自己的要求也不那么严格了，谈起话来，盛气凌人，动不动就想拿“权”压人。
    究竟什么叫领导权，怎样才能真正掌握领导权？针对这个问题，我们学习了最高指示。毛主席说：“所谓领导权，不是要一天到晚当作口号去高喊，也不是盛气凌人地要人家服从我们，而是以党的正确政策和自己的模范工作，说服和教育党外人士，使他们愿意接受我们的建议。”毛主席的教导，使我们思想开了窍。我们认识到：所谓领导权，决不是几块大印，也不是群众对我们的表面上的“服从”。只有坚决按照毛泽东思想办事，正确地执行党的政策，模范地工作，用自己的行动很好地影响群众，才有可能实现正确的领导，才能说是真正掌了权。否则，这个权是空的，是不巩固的。
    思想明确了，我们红色造反者决定开门整风，公开检查自己的缺点错误，认真听取群众的批评和意见。在整风中，广大群众肯定了我们的大方向是正确的，也给我们提出了不少意见，指出了我们的一些缺点、错误。我们非常重视群众提出的批评意见，即使是参加保守组织受蒙蔽的同志向我们提出的问题，也认真对待。我们公开检讨了在两派斗争中个别同志的错误。有人提出红色造反者出去活动有汽车，我们就提出要节约闹革命，今后不是全厂性的活动，出去尽量不坐汽车。有些该解释的事情，就说清楚情况；有些还弄不清的问题，就设立专门小组研究解决。总之，尽量做到群众提出的意见都能有交代。这样做，广大群众都比较满意。有的老工人说：“青年人犯错误难免，改了就好了，这才象个真正的革命派。”
    根据整风中提出的问题，我们红色造反队员，更加严格要求自己。在抓革命促生产方面，我们也努力做到起模范作用。开会耽误了生产，就抽时间补上，决不让国家利益遭受损失。
    经过整风，红色造反者在群众中的威信不是低了，而是更高了。我们的领导权，不是削弱了，而是更巩固了。现在，绝大多数群众都团结在毛主席的革命路线一边，全厂出现了革命大联合的大好形势。
