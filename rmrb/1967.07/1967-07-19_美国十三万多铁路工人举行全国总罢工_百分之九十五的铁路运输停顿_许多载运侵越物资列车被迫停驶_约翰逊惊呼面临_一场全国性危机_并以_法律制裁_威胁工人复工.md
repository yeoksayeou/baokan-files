Over 130,000 U.S. railroad workers launched a nationwide strike, causing 95% of rail transportation to halt. Many trains carrying supplies for the Vietnam War were forced to stop. Johnson exclaimed that the country was facing "a national crisis" and threatened workers with legal action to force them back to work.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 18th: Washington news: The first nationwide railroad workers' strike since the end of World War II in the United States began on the 16th, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S. ruling class and seriously affecting U.S. imperialism's war efforts in Vietnam. In a fit of rage, the Johnson administration tore off the "democratic" mask and took direct action to force railroad workers back to work.

Reports indicate that the strike, initiated by 137,000 railroad workers, has brought 95% of U.S. passenger and freight rail services to a standstill. At least 69 out of 76 major rail lines in the U.S. have been paralyzed. Directly and indirectly, 700,000 railroad workers are involved in this strike. Trains loaded with weapons and ammunition for the Vietnam War are stranded on the tracks; the strike has completely halted passenger rail services between the U.S. East and West coasts; mail delivery has been severely affected; raw material transportation has been disrupted, forcing many important industrial enterprises to face the prospect of shutting down due to lack of materials. According to estimates by U.S. news agencies, the strike has already cost the rail companies $75 million in just 48 hours.

The U.S. railroad workers' strike was triggered by the soaring prices caused by the Vietnam War, which have led to a continuous decline in workers' real wages. The strike has been brewing for about a year. Johnson had previously intervened twice, demanding that railroad workers accept "mediation" and not go on strike.

Johnson, who has been driven to desperation by the Vietnamese people and the black people's self-defense struggles in the U.S., abandoned his Sunday rest upon hearing the news of the strike and convened an emergency meeting with congressional leaders and cabinet members at the White House. On the 17th, Johnson also wrote a letter to Congress, urging immediate action to disrupt the railroad workers' strike. In his letter, this U.S. imperialist leader lamented that due to the rail strike, the U.S. is facing "a national crisis"; if the strike continues, it will cause even greater losses to the U.S. economy and "U.S. war efforts in Vietnam." Congress then rushed to pass an "emergency legislation" ordering railroad workers to immediately return to work, or face legal consequences. This reactionary law was signed by Johnson that evening and took effect immediately.

The broad masses of railroad workers have expressed their outrage at the Johnson administration's blatant violation of workers' strike rights. According to reports, some workers have publicly condemned Congress as "the nation's top strike-breaker." Reports indicate that in many U.S. rail transportation hubs, picket lines set up by striking workers were still holding firm on the 18th.

### 美国十三万多铁路工人举行全国总罢工  百分之九十五的铁路运输停顿　许多载运侵越物资列车被迫停驶  约翰逊惊呼面临“一场全国性危机”并以“法律制裁”威胁工人复工

    美国十三万多铁路工人举行全国总罢工
    百分之九十五的铁路运输停顿　许多载运侵越物资列车被迫停驶
    约翰逊惊呼面临“一场全国性危机”并以“法律制裁”威胁工人复工
    据新华社十八日讯　华盛顿消息：十六日开始的美国战后第一次铁路工人全国大罢工，使美国统治集团受到沉重的打击，并严重影响了美帝国主义的侵越战争活动。约翰逊政府在气急败坏之余，干脆扯掉了“民主”的遮羞布，赤膊上阵，强迫铁路工人复工。
    消息表明，由十三万七千名铁路工人发起的这次全国大罢工，迫使美国百分之九十五以上的铁路客运和货运陷于停顿，美国七十六条主要铁路中至少已经有六十九条瘫痪；直接间接卷入这次罢工斗争的铁路职工达七十万人。一列列满载供应侵越战争所需武器弹药的军火列车被迫停在轨道上；罢工还使美国东、西海岸之间的铁路客运完全断绝；邮递大受影响；原料运输受阻，使许多重要工业企业面临停工待料的危机。据美国通讯社估计，这次罢工在四十八小时内已经使铁路资方损失七千五百万美元。
    美国铁路工人的这次罢工是由于美国侵越战争使得物价飞涨，工人实际工资不断下降而引起的。这次罢工已经酝酿了约一年左右。约翰逊曾经两次强行干预，要铁路工人听候“调解”，不要罢工。
    被越南人民打得焦头烂额，被美国国内黑人暴力自卫斗争打得昏头转向的约翰逊，在得到罢工消息后，急得放弃了星期日的休息，在白宫召集国会头目和内阁成员举行紧急会议。约翰逊在十七日又写信给国会，要求迅速采取措施，企图破坏铁路工人罢工。这个美帝头子在信中哀叫，由于铁路大罢工，美国正面临着“一场全国性危机”；如果罢工继续下去，将使美国经济和“美国在越南的战争努力”遭到更大的损失。国会两院于是开足马力，匆匆通过了一项所谓“紧急立法”，限令铁路工人立即复工，否则将受到法律制裁。这项反动法令已经由约翰逊在当晚签署生效。
    广大铁路工人群众对约翰逊政府这种赤裸裸地破坏工人罢工权利的行径表示抗议。据报道，有些工人公开谴责国会成了“全国首屈一指的罢工破坏者”。消息表明，在美国不少铁路交通枢纽，罢工工人布置的纠察线在十八日仍在坚持中。（附图片）
