British military and police in Hong Kong have been provocatively harassing Chinese patriotic institutions and stores. Chinese patriotic compatriots have resolutely fought back against the British imperialist atrocities.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong on the 28th, in recent days, workers of patriotic institutions in Hong Kong and patriotic compatriots have been engaged in a resolute struggle and firm counterattack against the arrogant provocations and armed searches by the British fascist military and police.

The dying British authorities in Hong Kong, from July 25th to 27th over three days, escalated their provocations against Chinese patriotic institutions and stores. Eight patriotic institutions and stores were subjected to armed searches by British military and police, and the windows of nineteen institutions and stores were smashed or damaged. Many workers were brutally beaten and unlawfully arrested by British fascist thugs.

The mad provocations by British military and police have sparked immense anger among patriotic workers and compatriots, who have fought back resolutely. At 10:30 AM on the 26th, the British sent over a hundred "riot police" to the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company for the third time to provoke. These thugs, upon arriving at the China Merchants' entrance, pointed their guns at the windows of the building and shouted orders to close the windows. A British officer also directed Chinese police to use a loudspeaker to provoke the workers of China Merchants and ordered the "riot police" to tear down the posters of Chairman Mao's quotes and protest slogans displayed at the entrance. Workers of China Merchants broadcasted a warning through the loudspeaker:

"Strongly protest against the British authorities' provocation against the Chinese people!" "Down with British imperialism!" The workers stood ready to defend themselves, prepared to counter any further provocations. The British fascist police, facing the united resistance of the workers, eventually retreated in disgrace.

The Hong Kong patriotic compatriots, enraged by the large-scale arrests by the British fascist authorities, have been resolutely fighting back against the British provocations in recent days. They have been putting up anti-British and anti-violence slogans everywhere, distributing anti-British and anti-violence leaflets, and performing street propaganda shows to protest against the fascist atrocities of the British authorities. On the 26th, patriotic masses in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon threw explosive devices at British military and police, police stations, and other institutions, causing the enemies to be in a state of panic and fear. The British "Radio Hong Kong" had to admit that there were nine explosions in Kowloon, with one British soldier injured. Late that night around 11 PM, when the Sai Wan Ho police station in Hong Kong was bombed, many police officers fled in disarray, not even bothering to put on their coats.

    港英军警向我爱国机构和商店大肆挑衅
    我爱国同胞坚决反击英帝暴行
    据新华社香港二十八日电　连日来，香港爱国机构职工和爱国同胞对港英法西斯军警的猖狂挑衅和武装搜查，进行了针锋相对的斗争和坚决的回击。
    垂死挣扎的港英当局，在七月二十五日至二十七日三天，变本加厉地向我爱国机构和爱国商店大肆挑衅。有八个爱国机构和商店，遭到港英军警的武装搜查，有十九个机构和商店的橱窗遭到港英军警的捣毁或破坏。许多职工横遭港英法西斯暴徒的野蛮殴打和无理逮捕。
    港英军警的疯狂挑衅激起爱国职工和爱国同胞的无比愤怒，他们对港英军警进行了坚决的斗争。二十六日上午十时三十分，港英派出一百多名“防暴队”员到招商局轮船公司，进行第三次挑衅。这些暴徒在二十六日到达招商局门前时，竟用枪指向招商局大楼的窗户，并?喝关窗。英籍警官还指挥华警用扩音器向招商局职工挑衅，并且指令“防暴队”动手撕毁张贴在门前的毛主席语录和抗议标语。招商局职工通过广播喇叭，向敌人发出警告：
  “强烈抗议港英当局向中国人民挑衅！”“打倒英帝国主义！”职工们并严阵以待，准备随时迎击敌人的进一步挑衅。港英法西斯警察在同仇敌忾的职工面前，终于灰溜溜地撤去。
    被港英法西斯当局大搜捕激怒了的香港爱国同胞，连日来纷纷以实际行动坚决回击港英的猖狂挑衅。他们到处张贴反英抗暴标语，散发反英抗暴传单，在街头宣传演出，愤怒抗议港英当局的法西斯暴行。二十六日，爱国群众在香港、九龙许多地区，向港英军警、警署等机构投掷爆炸物，把敌人炸得失魂落魄，胆战心惊。港英的“香港广播电台”也不得不供认，九龙发生了九宗爆炸事件，有一名英军被炸伤。当天深夜十一时许，香港筲箕湾警署挨炸的时候，许多警察连外衣也顾不得穿就跑出来，狼狈逃命。
