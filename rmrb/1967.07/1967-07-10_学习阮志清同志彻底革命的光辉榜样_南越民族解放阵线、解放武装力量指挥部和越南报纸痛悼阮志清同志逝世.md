He made tremendous contributions to the revolutionary cause, embodying the spirit of a steadfast revolutionary warrior and an excellent communist.

	He was one of the leaders who paid great attention to educating and cultivating the revolutionary heroism of cadres and soldiers, and he himself was a shining example. In strengthening the bonds between the North and the South, the North's obligations to the South, the determination to defeat the American aggressors, defend the North, liberate the South, and unify the country, he set an example and deeply educated our cadres and soldiers. In the current struggle against American aggression and for national salvation, he made significant contributions in leadership and command, particularly in building a powerful people's armed force and developing the art of people's war.

However, his image, his valuable experiences, and the deep impressions he left will forever remain in the hearts of all Party members, cadres and soldiers of various armed forces, and our people. In his absolute loyalty to the Party's revolutionary cause, his love for the country and the people, his thorough revolutionary spirit of resolutely and continuously attacking all enemies to seize revolutionary victories, defend the Party, and uphold the truth, and his unwavering courage in the face of any danger and difficulty, he set a brilliant example.

	At this time, learning from him means concentrating all our strength, spirit, and creativity on the cause of resisting American aggression and saving the nation, defending the North, liberating the South, and unifying the country. Our great struggle has achieved tremendous victories, but it is also entering its most intense phase. We must follow Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh's example, resolutely charge forward, and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors to fight to the end for the independence, freedom, and socialism of our country.

	Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh's fighting spirit will live forever!

    新华社河内九日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方民族解放阵线中央委员会和越南南方解放武装力量指挥部，八日打电报给越南劳动党中央委员会、越南民主共和国国会和政府、越南人民军总司令部，深切悼念阮志清同志逝世。唁电全文如下：
    惊悉越南劳动党的出色的领导人，越南人民军总司令部的一位杰出的军事指挥员，一位在总结越南的战争指导的经验和人民军队的建军经验方面作出了巨大贡献的优秀理论家，一位毕生为人民、为祖国的坚强的革命战士阮志清大将于一九六七年七月六日上午九时逝世，越南南方全体人民和越南南方解放武装力量全体干部和战士，感到无比哀痛。
    我们谨代表南方人民和解放武装力量，向越南劳动党中央委员会、越南民主共和国国会和政府、越南人民军总司令部和阮志清大将的亲属，表示最深切的哀悼。
    据新华社河内九日电　越南《人民报》和《人民军队报》发表题为《无比痛惜阮志清同志》的社论，痛悼阮志清同志逝世。社论说，我们全党、全军、全民无比沉痛地获悉阮志清同志逝世的消息。他的逝世，是我们的一个巨大的损失。
    阮志清同志是我们党的一位出色的领导同志，是我们军队的一位杰出的指挥者，是各种武装力量的全体干部和战士每次提到他的名字的时候，心里就充满着敬爱和钦佩的感情的人。他为革命事业作出了巨大的贡献，高度发扬了一个坚强的革命战士，一个优秀的共产主义者的精神。
    他是十分关心教育和培养干部和战士的革命英雄主义精神的领导干部之一，而他自己就是一个光辉的榜样。他在加强南北两方的骨肉情谊，北方对南方的义务，决心战胜美国侵略强盗，保卫北方，解放南方，统一祖国方面树立了榜样，并且对我们的干部和战士进行了深刻的教育。在目前的抗美救国事业中，他在领导和指挥方面作出了巨大的贡献，特别是为建设强大的人民武装力量和发展人民战争的卓越的军事艺术作出了积极的贡献。

    在这个时候学习他，就是要把我们的全部力量、精神和创造才能，集中到抗美救国事业和保卫北方，解放南方，统一祖国事业上来。我们伟大的抗战取得了巨大的胜利，但也正在进入最激烈的阶段。我们要以阮志清同志为榜样，坚决冲上前去，彻底战胜美国侵略强盗，为祖国的独立、自由和为社会主义奋斗到底。
    阮志清同志的战斗精神永垂不朽！
