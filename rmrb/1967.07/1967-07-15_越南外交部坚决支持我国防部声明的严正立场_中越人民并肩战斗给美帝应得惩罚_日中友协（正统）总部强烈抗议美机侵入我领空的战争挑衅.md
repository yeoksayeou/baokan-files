		The spokesperson of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement on July 14 strongly condemning the American imperialists' dispatch of four F-105 aircraft on July 12 to invade the airspace of Dongxing County in the Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, western part, firing missiles at the Chinese border defense forces, injuring four Chinese People's Liberation Army soldiers, and destroying one house. This is a serious war provocation.

		The statement pointed out that this is a very serious new provocation by the American imperialists against the People's Republic of China.

		The statement firmly supports the serious stance expressed in the statement of the Chinese Defense Ministry on July 12. The Government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam demands that the U.S. government must stop all war provocations against the People's Republic of China.

		The statement said: The American imperialists are the common enemy of the peoples of Vietnam and China. If they deliberately expand the war of aggression against Vietnam and continue to take provocative actions against the People's Republic of China, then the Vietnamese people and the fraternal Chinese people will stand even more closely together to give the American imperialists their deserved punishment.

		Fifteen people, including Vice Chairman Dai Sen Zhen Yi Lang of the Japan-China Friendship Association (Genuine), went to the front of the U.S. Embassy in Japan on July 14 to strongly protest the serious war provocation of four U.S. F-105 fighter jets invading Chinese airspace on July 12. They presented a protest letter to the officials of the U.S. Embassy.

		The protest letter pointed out in a serious manner that this is a serious war provocation by the American imperialists against the People's Republic of China.

		The protest letter strongly opposes the American imperialists turning Japanese territory into a base for invading Vietnam, Asia, and China. The protest letter says: "The Japanese people will not allow the American imperialists to continue using our country's territory, airspace, seas, and all resources in an aggressive war. We demand that the U.S. military withdraw from our country immediately."
