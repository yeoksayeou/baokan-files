The Chinese Embassy in Burma has exposed the tricks of the Burmese authorities' so-called "safety measures." The Ne Win government is the culprit behind the sabotage of the safety of the Chinese Embassy.

New China News Agency, July 7th: Rangoon News: The Chinese Embassy in Burma sent a note to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 6th, strongly refuting the Ne Win reactionary government's note regarding the safety measures for the Chinese Embassy.

The Burmese reactionary government, which is the executioner of the massacre of Chinese experts and a large number of overseas Chinese, attempted to evade responsibility in its note on the 5th, portraying itself as a philanthropist and repeatedly claiming that it wants to "protect the Chinese Embassy in Rangoon and the embassy officials."

The Chinese Embassy pointed out in its note: "The reason why the Chinese Embassy and its officials are currently unsafe is not due to anything else, but precisely because your Burmese reactionary government has been frenziedly anti-China and anti-Chinese, organizing and inciting mobs to attack the Chinese Embassy, savagely killing and beating Chinese experts and embassy personnel, and carrying out a large-scale massacre, arrest, and looting of overseas Chinese. This insecurity is entirely manufactured by the Burmese reactionary government. You are the culprits behind the sabotage of the safety of the Chinese Embassy."

The note said: "As long as your Burmese reactionary government bows its head to the Chinese government and people, admits its guilt, and guarantees not to organize and incite mobs to kill and set fires again, our embassy will be safe. If your government insists on its course and is determined to completely deteriorate the relations between the two countries, and stubbornly continues to be anti-China and anti-Chinese, then you do not need to expend so much effort, mobilizing entire battalions of soldiers to surround the embassy day and night, setting up barbed wire, and dispatching so many military vehicles to follow us. In essence, your actions are nothing but thieves crying 'catch the thief,' merely to cover up your banditry."

The note said: "Our embassy is the official diplomatic representative of the People's Republic of China. We represent the great seven hundred million Chinese people. Our embassy personnel are engaged in normal diplomatic and administrative activities, and the Burmese government has no right to interfere. You are now trying to control and restrict the normal diplomatic activities of the Chinese Embassy in Rangoon through some 'military-controlled area' measures, which is completely contrary to international norms and an infringement on the diplomatic privileges of the Chinese Embassy. Your actions will expose your ugly face to the people of the world."

The note said: "It must be pointed out that you are not only restricting our normal activities but also deliberately obstructing the normal exchanges between other diplomatic missions and us. The purpose of your demarcating the area where the Chinese Embassy is located as a restricted area within a restricted area is precisely this."

The note finally sternly warned the Burmese reactionary government: "Your Burmese government is fully responsible for protecting the safety of the lives and property of the Chinese Embassy in Burma, all personnel sent by the Chinese government to work in Burma, and overseas Chinese. If incidents of killing, arson, and looting occur again, we will hold you accountable. However, we absolutely do not allow you to use 'protection' as a pretext to restrict our freedom of action. We are putting it on record: if you insist on going against the grain, do not say we did not warn you."

　　我大使馆揭穿缅甸当局所谓“安全措施”的鬼花招
　　奈温政府是破坏我使馆安全的罪魁
    新华社七日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆六日照会缅甸外交部，严厉驳斥奈温反动政府所谓关于中国大使馆安全措施的来照。
    缅甸反动政府这个屠杀中国专家和大批华侨的刽子手，在五日的来照中，妄图逃避罪责，把自己打扮成慈善家，口口声声说什么要“保护在仰光的中国大使馆和大使馆官员”。
    中国大使馆在照会中指出：“中国大使馆及官员现在之所以不安全不是因为别的，正是因为你们缅甸反动政府疯狂地反华排华，一手组织和纵容了暴徒袭击中国大使馆，野蛮杀害和毒打中国专家和使馆人员，对华侨大屠杀、大逮捕、大抢劫。这个不安全是缅甸反动政府一手制造的。你们就是破坏中国大使馆安全的罪魁祸首。”
    照会说：“只要你们缅甸反动政府向中国政府和人民低头认罪，并保证不再组织和纵容暴徒来杀人放火，我们大使馆就很安全。假如你们的政府一意孤行，决心要彻底恶化两国关系，硬要顽固反华排华到底，那么你们大可不必花费那么大的力气，调动整营大兵昼夜包围使馆，架设铁丝网和派出那么多军车跟着我们。说穿了，你们这些做法不过是贼喊捉贼，只不过是为了掩盖你们的强盗行径而已。”
    照会说：“我们大使馆是中华人民共和国的正式外交代表机构。我们代表着伟大的七亿中国人民。我们大使馆的人员进行正常外交和事务活动，缅甸政府根本无权过问。你们现在想通过什么‘军管区’的办法来控制和限制中国大使馆在仰光的正常外交活动是完全违反国际关系准则和侵犯中国大使馆外交特权的。你们这样做必将在全世界人民面前暴露你们的丑恶面目。”
    照会说：“必须严正指出的是，你们现在不仅限制我们的正常活动，而且还蓄意阻挠其他外交使团同我们的正常往来，你们把中国大使馆所在地划成禁区中的禁区的目的就在这里。”
    照会最后严正警告缅甸反动政府：“你们缅甸政府负有完全责任保护在缅甸的中国大使馆和中国政府派出的所有的在缅甸工作人员以及华侨生命财产的安全。假如再次发生杀人放火抢劫事件，我们就要唯你们是问。但是，我们也绝对不允许你们借‘保护’为名限制我们行动的自由。我们先把话说在前头，你们硬要倒行逆施，就勿谓言之不预也。”
