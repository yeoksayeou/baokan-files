The Yangtze River roars, the Han River bellows, and the three towns of Wuhan are in turmoil.

The handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the military in the Wuhan area, along with the core elements of the "Million Heroes" and the "Public Security, Procuratorate, and Courts" who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line, have openly defied Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, directing their spears at Chairman Mao's proletarian headquarters.

This serious political incident has aroused the utmost indignation among the revolutionary masses and the broad ranks of soldiers in the Wuhan area, and has been severely condemned by the people of the entire country. It has met with strong opposition from the army, navy, and air force. From the coasts of the East China Sea to the foothills of the Tian Mountains, from Hainan Island to Changbai Mountain, along both banks of the great rivers and within and beyond the Great Wall, revolutionary masses and soldiers have taken to the streets, holding demonstrations and parades. Countless protest letters have been sent to the handful of bad elements in the Wuhan area. Batches of congratulatory telegrams have been sent to the proletarian revolutionaries in the Wuhan area. The ringleaders who created this serious incident have fallen into the vast sea of indignation from hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians.

The closer the class enemy is to death, the more frantically and with tenfold hatred they struggle to the end. The handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the military in the Wuhan area are the agents of the biggest handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party in the Wuhan area. The serious political incident in the Wuhan area is not an isolated or accidental phenomenon but a prominent manifestation of their desperate struggles.

All class enemies always overestimate their own strength and underestimate the strength of the people. Once upon a time, they were arrogant, tyrannical, and disdainful of others, thinking they could swallow the proletarian revolutionaries in one gulp and extinguish the blazing flames of the Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan area with one stroke. However, their efforts are like a mantis blocking a chariot or an ant shaking a tree—laughable and self-deluded. In no time, they have become isolated individuals, despised by everyone, and rats crossing the street. All class enemies appear to be strong, but in reality, they are nothing more than a tin spearhead, a paper tiger, a clay-footed person, very weak.

In our era, no matter who you are, no matter how high your position, how senior your status, or how strong your backing, as long as you oppose Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, you will definitely be crushed into powder by the wheels of history and become a pile of filth despised by humanity.

The struggle has not ended. The class enemy is still plotting new schemes, sowing discord among the proletarian revolutionaries, creating divisions, and attempting to launch a new counterattack against the proletarian revolutionaries. We must be a thousand times more vigilant, strengthen our unity, expose and smash all the enemy's schemes.

The bad elements are only a handful. The serious political incident in the Wuhan area fully proves this. We must strictly distinguish between this handful of bad elements and the broad masses who have been deceived. For the ringleaders who created this serious incident in the Wuhan area, we must thoroughly expose them, resolutely overthrow them, investigate them thoroughly, and punish them according to law. For the broad masses who have been deceived, we must be good at enlightening them, patiently helping them, supporting and encouraging them to stand up and fight back, and warmly welcoming them back to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We must unite with them, fight side by side, and together confront the enemy, forming a mighty revolutionary army to open fire on the people's main enemy.

Those who have made mistakes should correct them with concrete actions and win the understanding of the revolutionary masses. Those who can do this are good comrades.

Recently, the leadership of the Wuhan Military District publicly criticized the wrong direction and line in their support-left work, which is a good start and has been welcomed by the broad revolutionary masses. We warmly hope that they will continue to advance in this correct direction and believe that they will.

The broad ranks of soldiers in the Wuhan Military District should continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely support and defend the broad masses of the left, breathe together, share the same fate, unite together, fight together, and win together.

Bad things have turned into good things. The conspiracy planned by the handful of capitalist-roaders in power within the Party and the military in the Wuhan area has been defeated. A handful of capitalist-roaders in power hidden within the Party and the military have been exposed. The proletarian revolutionaries in the Wuhan area have been tempered to be even stronger and braver, and their ranks have grown even larger. The broad revolutionary masses in the Wuhan area have undergone this severe test and have greatly increased their awareness. The serious political incident in the Wuhan area is the most vivid class struggle education and the most profound education on the two lines of the proletariat and the bourgeoisie for the revolutionary masses across the country. It will widely mobilize the enthusiasm of the people across the country and carry out the unprecedented proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end.

History is leaping forward, and the revolution is advancing.

The proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan area is entering a new stage of victory.

The victory songs of the three towns of Wuhan are inspiring the people of the entire country, and a new upsurge in the proletarian Cultural Revolution across the country has begun.

Let us open our arms and welcome the new storm of class struggle!

Victory will surely belong to the proletarian revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought!

    向人民的主要敌人猛烈开火
    《红旗》杂志一九六七年第十二期社论
    长江在怒吼，汉水在咆哮，武汉三镇在沸腾。
    武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和被他们操纵的“百万雄师”、“公检法”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头，公然反抗毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，把矛头指向毛主席的无产阶级司令部。
    这一严重的政治事件，激起了武汉地区的广大革命群众和广大指战员的无比愤慨，受到了全国人民的严正谴责，遭到了陆海空三军的强大反对。从东海之滨到天山之麓，从海南岛到长白山，大江两岸，长城内外，广大革命群众和广大指战员，走上街头，游行示威。无数的抗议书，指向武汉地区一小撮坏人。大批的致敬电，飞向武汉地区的无产阶级革命派。制造这一严重事件的罪魁祸首，陷入了亿万军民愤怒声讨的汪洋大海之中。
    阶级敌人越接近死亡，就越要以十倍的疯狂，百倍增长的仇恨，作拚死的挣扎。武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，是党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派在武汉地区的代理人。武汉地区发生的严重政治事件，决不是孤立的、偶然的现象，而是他们垂死挣扎的一个突出表现。
    一切阶级敌人总是过高地估计自己力量，轻视人民的力量。想当初，他们飞扬跋扈，横行霸道，目中无人，不可一世，妄图一口吃掉无产阶级革命派，一举扑灭武汉地区文化大革命的熊熊烈火。但是，螳臂挡车，蚍蜉撼树，可笑不自量。曾几何时，他们成了众叛亲离的孤家寡人，人人喊打的过街老鼠。一切阶级敌人，看起来貌似强大，实际上只不过是银样镴枪尖一根，纸老虎、泥足人一个，虚弱得很。
    在我们的时代，不管你是谁，不管你地位多高，资格多老，后台多硬，只要你反对毛泽东思想，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，就一定要被历史的车轮碾得粉碎，成为不齿于人类的狗屎堆。
    斗争并没有结束。阶级敌人还正在玩弄新的阴谋，在无产阶级革命派之间挑拨离间，制造分裂，妄图对无产阶级革命派进行新的反扑。我们要千百倍地提高警惕，加强团结，揭穿和粉碎敌人的一切阴谋诡计。
    坏人只是一小撮。武汉地区的这一严重政治事件充分证明了这一点。我们要把一小撮坏人和广大受蒙蔽的群众严格区别开来。对制造武汉地区这一严重事件的罪魁祸首，必须彻底揭露，坚决打倒，严加追查，依法惩办。对广大受蒙蔽的群众，要善于启发，耐心帮助，支持和鼓励他们站出来，大杀回马枪，热情地欢迎他们回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。我们要和他们团结起来，并肩战斗，共同对敌，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，向人民的主要敌人猛烈开火。
    那些犯过错误的人，应该以实际行动认真改正错误，取得革命群众的谅解。能够这样做，就是好同志。
    最近，武汉部队领导机关公开检讨了支左工作中的方向、路线错误，这是一个好的开端，已经得到广大革命群众的欢迎。我们热情地希望他们、并且相信他们能够按照这一正确的方向继续前进。
    武汉驻军广大指战员要继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决支持和保卫左派广大群众，同他们同呼吸，共命运，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。
    坏事变成了好事。武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所策划的阴谋被击败了。一小撮暗藏在党内、军内的走资本主义道路当权派，被揪出来了。武汉地区的无产阶级革命派锻炼得更加坚强，更加勇敢，队伍更加壮大了。武汉地区的广大革命群众经受了这一次严峻的考验，觉悟大大提高。武汉地区的这次严重的政治事件，对全国革命群众，是一次最生动的阶级斗争的教育，是最深刻的无产阶级和资产阶级两条路线的教育，它必将广泛地动员全国人民的积极性，把这一场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    历史在飞跃，革命在前进。
    武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命正在出现一个新的胜利的阶段。
    武汉三镇的胜利凯歌鼓舞着全国人民，全国无产阶级文化大革命新的高涨开始了。
    让我们伸开双手，迎接阶级斗争的新的大风暴吧！
    胜利一定属于用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派！
