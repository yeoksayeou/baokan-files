	Soviet Revisionist Trade Office Staff Caught Red-Handed Stealing Intelligence by Our Red Guards
	Our Ministry of Foreign Affairs Protests Strongly to the Soviet Revisionist Chargé d'Affaires
	Warning: Soviet Diplomatic Personnel Must Obey Our Laws and Cease All Illegal Activities

	New China News Agency, July 3rd: The responsible official of the Soviet and Eastern European Affairs Section of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China summoned the Chargé d'Affaires of the Soviet Embassy in China, Razdukhov, on July 3rd, and presented him with a verbal statement. The statement strongly protested the illegal activities of the Soviet Trade Representative Office staff in China, which involved stealing intelligence, as well as the malicious attacks and slanders made by the Soviet side against our Red Guards and the revolutionary masses.

	The statement said that on June 11, 1967, the staff members of the Soviet Trade Representative Office in China, Grasimov and Khantimirov, accompanied by staff from the China Machinery Import and Export Corporation, went to Shenyang City to handle the compensation issue arising from the non-conforming machine tools exported by the Soviet Union to China. The relevant Chinese authorities provided all the necessary conditions for them to carry out this work. Even Grasimov had to admit that the preparations made by the Chinese side for the inspection work were adequate. However, the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, in its statement on June 21, maliciously claimed that the Chinese side had created "unbearable conditions" for them, which was a deliberate slander.

	The statement said that compensation issues are common in foreign trade. If the Soviet side had good intentions, it would not be difficult to resolve them. However, the Soviet side had no intention of resolving the compensation issue. The staff members sent, Grasimov and Khantimirov, did not understand the business at all and did not even know how to use a level. In Shenyang, they created various excuses to delay and even refuse to discuss the compensation matter with our relevant personnel. The relevant Chinese authorities expressed indignation at the Soviet side's deliberate delay in resolving the issue.

	The statement emphasized that what was even more intolerable was that the staff members of the Soviet Trade Representative Office, Grasimov and Khantimirov, took the opportunity to solve the machine tool compensation issue in Shenyang to sneak around with ulterior motives, stealing and copying big-character posters, shamelessly collecting and stealing intelligence and information about our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The Red Guards and revolutionary masses of our country, armed with the great thought of Mao Zedong, caught them red-handed, ordered them to hand over the illegally collected intelligence, debated with them, and gave them a warning. This was a completely just revolutionary action, and it was very good. Now you are turning things upside down, distorting right and wrong, and falsely accusing our Red Guards and revolutionary masses of crimes they did not commit. You are truly shameless. We firmly reject the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs' statement of June 21st and strongly protest against the illegal activities of the Soviet Trade Representative Office staff in stealing intelligence and the malicious attacks and slanders made by the Soviet side against our Red Guards and revolutionary masses.

	The statement finally said, we solemnly warn you that the revolutionary masses of China will not allow you to engage in activities that harm our national interests on Chinese soil. You must obediently follow our laws, respect our revolutionary order, and immediately stop all your illegal activities. The spokesperson of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs' talk on June 14th about the personnel of the imperialist, revisionist, and reactionary diplomatic missions in China must stop stealing intelligence activities, is binding. If you insist on continuing illegal activities, the Chinese side will take necessary measures. Do not say you were not warned.

　　苏修商务处人员窃取情报当场被我红卫兵抓住黑手
　　我外交部向苏修代办提出强烈抗议
　　警告苏修外交人员必须老老实实遵守我国法令停止一切非法活动
    新华社三日讯　中华人民共和国外交部苏联东欧司负责人七月三日召见苏联驻华大使馆临时代办拉兹杜霍夫，向他提出一项口头声明，对苏联驻华商务代表处工作人员在我国非法进行窃取情报的活动以及苏联方面对我国红卫兵和广大革命群众进行的恶毒攻击和诬蔑，提出强烈的抗议。
    声明说，一九六七年六月十一日，苏联驻华商务代表处工作人员格拉西莫夫和罕季米洛夫，在中国机械进出口总公司工作人员的陪同下，到我国沈阳市处理由于苏联向中国出口的机床不合规格而引起的索赔问题。中国有关方面为他们进行此项工作提供了一切必要的条件。连格拉西莫夫也不得不承认说，中国方面对检验工作的准备是充分的。而苏联外交部在六月二十一日的声明中，竟然胡说什么中国方面为他们“制造了不可容忍的条件”，这完全是蓄意的诽谤。
    声明说，索赔问题是对外贸易中常有的事情，如果苏联方面具有诚意，本来是不难解决的。但是，苏联方面毫无诚意解决索赔问题，派出的工作人员格拉西莫夫和罕季米洛夫根本不懂业务，甚至连水平仪都不知道怎么使用。他们在沈阳，制造种种借口拖延甚至拒绝同我有关人员商谈索赔事宜。中国有关方面对苏联方面蓄意拖延解决问题的态度表示愤慨。
    声明强调说，更加令人不能容忍的是，苏联商务代表处工作人员格拉西莫夫和罕季米洛夫竟然盗用在沈阳解决机床索赔问题的机会，别有用心地到处乱钻，偷看偷抄大字报，肆无忌惮地搜集和窃取我国无产阶级文化大革命的资料和情报。用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的我国红卫兵小将和广大革命群众，当场抓住了他们的黑手，责令他们交出非法搜罗的情报，与他们进行辩论，并给予警告，这是完全正义的革命行动，好得很。你们现在竟然倒打一耙，在六月二十一日声明中，颠倒黑白，混淆是非，给我红卫兵小将和革命群众横加莫须有的罪名，真是不知人间还有羞耻二字。我们坚决拒绝苏联外交部六月二十一日的声明，并对苏联驻华商务代表处工作人员非法窃取情报的活动以及苏联方面对我国红卫兵和广大革命群众进行的恶毒攻击和诬蔑，提出强烈的抗议。
    声明最后说，我们要严正警告你们，中国广大革命群众决不容许你们在中国领土上从事危害我国国家利益的活动。你们必须老老实实地遵守我国的法令，尊重我国的革命秩序，立即停止你们的一切非法活动。我国外交部发言人六月十四日关于帝修反驻华机构人员必须停止窃取情报活动的谈话，是算数的。如果你们硬要一意孤行，继续搞非法活动，中国方面将采取必要的措施。勿谓言之不预也。
