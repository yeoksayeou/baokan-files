Anyone who opposes Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is our most bitter enemy.

China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan have been submerged in a sea of nationwide condemnation.

The victorious struggle in Wuhan has greatly inspired and encouraged the hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians across the country. Tens of millions of people in various provinces and cities have held massive rallies, parades, and demonstrations, driving the revolutionary criticism movement to new heights. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new phase of high tide nationwide.

	New China News Agency, July 28th: "Rats crossing the street, everyone shouts to beat them!" China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan area, a handful of power-holders within the Party and the military who are taking the capitalist road, and a handful of bad leaders within the "Million Hero Army" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, have already been submerged in the sea of indignation from hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians across the country.

	Currently, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan is entering a new stage of victory. The nationwide Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is also beginning a new high tide. The representatives sent by our great leader Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to solve the Wuhan problem, Comrades Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li, have triumphantly returned to Chairman Mao's side. After more than a year of arduous struggle, the revolutionary masses of Wuhan have bravely defeated the fierce attacks of a handful of power-holders within the Party and the military who are taking the capitalist road. This is a new great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and a new great victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This new great victory has greatly inspired and encouraged the hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians across the country, driving the nationwide revolutionary criticism movement to new heights.

	Since the news of Comrades Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li's glorious return to Beijing, massive rallies and demonstrations have been held in various major cities, provinces, municipalities, and autonomous regions, with tens of millions of participants. Alongside these large-scale rallies and demonstrations, countless factories, schools, offices, shops, rural areas, and military units have held large and small criticism meetings, denunciation meetings, and oath-taking meetings to fiercely attack China's Khrushchev. Revolutionary masses, revolutionary groups, and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army across the country have expressed their determination to learn from the fearless revolutionary spirit of the Wuhan proletarian revolutionary masses, to focus all their hatred on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, to thoroughly settle their accounts, and to criticize them politically, ideologically, and theoretically, ensuring that they are reviled for eternity and that our proletarian iron fortress remains unshakable!

	In the birthplace of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, Beijing, activities fully supporting the revolutionary masses in Wuhan are developing more broadly and deeply. In recent days, factories, offices, schools, shops, rural areas, and the leadership and troops of the People's Liberation Army stationed in Beijing have all held meetings to denounce the crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan. Revolutionary comrades from Wuhan were invited to share their struggle achievements. At various meetings, people pointed out: The handful of power-holders within the Party and the military in Wuhan who are taking the capitalist road, along with their backer China's Khrushchev, have already been surrounded by hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses. Their complete collapse and annihilation are inevitable. However, the enemy is not willing to accept their defeat. "All reactionaries are paper tigers." We must follow the strategic deployment of our great leader Chairman Mao, carry forward the thorough revolutionary spirit of "beating fallen enemies," advance victoriously, and fight fiercely to bury the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road in the sea of revolutionary criticism.

	In Shanghai, China's largest industrial city, and its suburban rural areas, hundreds of thousands of people have taken to the streets in recent days for powerful demonstrations. Many factories, offices, schools, shops, military units, and people's communes have held denunciation meetings and criticism meetings. Some Mao Zedong Thought art propaganda teams have performed street corner dramas and other programs, exposing and denouncing the crimes of China's Khrushchev. The revolutionary masses and the broad ranks of soldiers in Shanghai have pointed out that the handful of power-holders within the Party and the military in Wuhan who are taking the capitalist road have launched a reckless attack on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and have been met with a head-on counterattack by the revolutionary people and the broad ranks of soldiers across the country. These bad elements have become rats crossing the street, and everyone is shouting to beat them.

	We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and, together with the revolutionary people of Wuhan and across the country, pursue victory and thoroughly defeat the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

	In recent days, more than a million people in Tianjin have taken to the streets for demonstrations. Along the banks of the Haihe River, the roar of denunciations against China's Khrushchev can be heard day and night. The revolutionary masses, revolutionary groups, and soldiers participating in the demonstrations have highly praised the heroic revolutionary comrades, revolutionary workers, peasants, and soldiers in Wuhan for their unwavering loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao and to the cause of our Party. They have created tremendous achievements in defending the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. They have expressed their determination to follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao: "It is advisable to pursue the fleeing enemy with remaining courage," concentrate the target, concentrate the firepower, and continuously advance the revolutionary criticism movement.

	In Shenyang, the largest industrial base in Northeast China, more than a million soldiers and civilians have held grand rallies and parades. The broad revolutionary masses, revolutionary groups, and soldiers have unanimously pointed out that in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a few jumping jacks have come out to perform, which is nothing to be surprised about! The more fiercely the enemy counterattacks, the more their reactionary faces are exposed, and the closer their day of annihilation comes. The soldiers of the former class of Liu Yingjun said, we, the people's warriors armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have the reddest hearts, the brightest eyes, the firmest stand, and the most vivid banner. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Party Central Committee, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is our most bitter enemy, and we will fight them to the end!

	The comrades of the "July 27th Commune" in Henan, who have been fighting side by side with the Wuhan revolutionaries, held a grand rally and parade with 200,000 participants today, firmly supporting the struggle of their Wuhan comrades. Representatives of the "July 27th Commune" and representatives of the People's Liberation Army supporting the revolutionary masses in Henan both spoke at the meeting. The revolutionary masses participating in the meeting and parade pointed out that today's grand rally and parade is Henan's revolutionary masses' second show of support for their Wuhan comrades and another grand oath-taking to launch a total attack on China's Khrushchev and his agents in Central China.

	In Guangzhou, Nanchang, Taiyuan, Xi'an, Lanzhou, and many other places, since the news of Comrades Xie Fuzhi and Wang Li's glorious return to Chairman Mao's side, the revolutionary masses and local soldiers participating in street demonstrations have all reached hundreds of thousands. Such large-scale activities in various places have become a powerful force mobilizing the broad masses to further engage in the great criticism and struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party and the military who are taking the capitalist road.

	The surging revolutionary torrent of support for the Wuhan proletarian revolutionary masses is continuing to expand in many medium-sized and small cities, county towns, and vast rural areas across the country. In the forest city of Yichun in Heilongjiang Province, as well as in Bei'an, Heilong, and Bayan, in the Yanbei, Xinzhou, Jinzhong, Jinzhong, and Jinnan regions of Shanxi Province, in the Ganzhou, Jingdezhen, Jian, Jiujiang, Fuzhou, and Dongxiang regions of Jiangxi Province, and in the Chuang, Simao, Baoshan, Lijiang, Wenshan, Yuxi, and Xishuangbanna regions of Yunnan Province on the southwestern border, powerful voices of denunciation against the handful of power-holders within the Party and the military in Wuhan who are taking the capitalist road have been raised. The autonomous prefectures of Xishuangbanna and Chuxiong have each held rallies and parades with tens of thousands of participants. The revolutionary masses of Xishuangbanna said, high mountains cannot block the golden sun, and distant roads cannot stop the eagle's wings. We will forever fight side by side with the revolutionary comrades in Wuhan and across the country. The members of the Dulong ethnic group living in the Dulong Valley said: Although Wuhan and Dulongjiang are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are closely connected with those of the Wuhan revolutionaries. Under the wise leadership of our great leader Chairman Mao, there are no mountains too high to cross, no rivers too wide to cross, and no enemies that cannot be defeated. The iron fists of the hundreds of millions of revolutionary masses in Wuhan and across the country will surely thoroughly defeat China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan!

	The large-scale mass movements across the country to support the struggle of the Wuhan revolutionary masses show that the hundreds of millions of soldiers and civilians across the country deeply admire the fearless spirit and resolute actions of the Wuhan revolutionary masses and have immense hatred for China's Khrushchev and the handful of power-holders within the Party and the military who are taking the capitalist road. The revolutionary masses across the country have received a vivid class struggle education and a profound two-line struggle education from the struggle in Wuhan, which is broadly mobilizing the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people across the country and inspiring and encouraging the people across the country to carry the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    谁反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，谁就是我们不共戴天的最大敌人
    中国赫鲁晓夫及其武汉代理人陷入全国声讨的汪洋大海
    武汉的胜利斗争，极大地激励和鼓舞着全国亿万军民。各省市几千万人次举行了声势浩大的集会游行和示威，推动革命的大批判运动一浪高过一浪，全国文化大革命开始了一个新高涨
    新华社二十八日讯　“老鼠过街，人人喊打！”中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人，党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，“百万雄师”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头，已经陷入了全国亿万军民愤怒声讨的汪洋大海之中。
    目前，武汉的无产阶级文化大革命正在进入一个新的胜利阶段，全国的无产阶级文化大革命也开始了一个新高涨。我们伟大领袖毛主席和党中央为解决武汉问题派出的代表谢富治、王力等同志胜利地回到毛主席身边，武汉无产阶级革命派经过一年多的艰苦奋战，终于英勇地打败了党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的猖狂进攻，这是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的新的伟大胜利，是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的新的伟大胜利。这个新的伟大胜利，极大的激励和鼓舞了各地亿万军民，正在推动着全国规模的革命大批判运动一浪高过一浪。
    自从谢富治、王力同志光荣回到北京的消息传来，在全国各大城市，在各省、市、自治区，已经有几千万人次举行了声势浩大的集会和示威游行。在集中举行大规模集会游行的同时，还有数不清的工厂、学校、机关、商店、农村的革命群众和部队，召开了大大小小的向中国的赫鲁晓夫猛烈开火的批判会、声讨会和誓师会。全国各地无产阶级革命派、革命群众和中国人民解放军指战员纷纷表示，一定要学习武汉无产阶级革命派大无畏的革命精神，把千种仇万种恨都集中到党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派身上，彻底清算他们的滔天罪行，从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批倒批臭，真正做到让他们遗臭万年，永保我们无产阶级的铁打江山不变颜色！
    在无产阶级文化大革命的策源地北京，全力支持武汉地区革命派的活动，正在更加广泛更加深入地向前发展。连日来，首都的工厂、机关、学校、商店、农村，以及人民解放军驻京领导机关和驻京部队，纷纷举行集会，声讨中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区代理人的罪行。来自武汉的无产阶级革命派战士，被邀请向大家介绍了他们的斗争业绩。在各种集会上，人们纷纷指出：对党对人民犯下滔天罪行的武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派以及他们的总后台中国的赫鲁晓夫，已经陷入亿万革命群众的重重包围。他们彻底垮台、彻底灭亡的命运已经注定了。但是，敌人并不甘心他们的失败。“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”我们一定要紧跟伟大领袖毛主席的战略部署，发扬“痛打落水狗”的彻底革命精神，乘胜前进，猛冲猛打，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派彻底埋葬在革命大批判的海洋中。
    在我国最大的工业城市上海和郊区农村，这几天已有一百八十多万人走上街头，举行强大的示威游行。许多工厂、机关、学校、商店、部队和农村人民公社，纷纷举行了声讨会和批判会。一些毛泽东思想文艺宣传小分队，在街头和基层单位演出活报剧和其他节目，揭发和声讨中国的赫鲁晓夫的罪行。上海的无产阶级革命派和驻军广大指战员严正指出，武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，向毛主席的革命路线发动狂妄的进攻，遭到了全国革命人民和解放军广大指战员的迎头痛击。这一小撮坏家伙已经成了过街老鼠，人人喊打。
    我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，同武汉和全国的革命人民一起，乘胜追击，彻底打倒党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。
    这几天来，天津市军民走上街头示威游行的，超过了一百万人次。在海河两岸，终日震响着声讨中国赫鲁晓夫的怒吼声。参加示威游行的无产阶级革命派、革命群众和驻军指战员，热烈赞扬武汉英勇的无产阶级革命派战士、革命的工农兵，无限忠于伟大领袖毛主席和我们党的事业，为保卫毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，创造了非常巨大的业绩。他们表示，一定要遵照伟大领袖毛主席的教导：“宜将剩勇追穷寇”，集中目标，集中火力，把革命的大批判运动不断推向前进。
    在我国东北最大的工业基地沈阳，已经有一百多万军民举行盛大的集会游行。广大无产阶级革命派、革命群众和驻军指战员，一致指出，在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，有几个跳梁小丑出来表演一番，这没什么了不起！敌人越是疯狂反扑，他们的反革命面目就更加暴露，他们彻底灭亡的日子就更加临近。沈阳部队某部刘英俊生前所在班的战士们说，我们用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民战士，心最红，眼最亮，立场最坚定，旗帜最鲜明。谁反对毛主席，反对林副主席，反对党中央，反对中央文革小组，反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，谁就是我们不共戴天的最大敌人，我们就和他战斗到底！
    一直同武汉革命派并肩战斗的河南“二七公社”的战士们，今天又同当地驻军指战员一起举行了有二十万人参加的盛大集会游行，坚决支持武汉战友的斗争。“二七公社”代表和支持河南地区无产阶级革命派的人民解放军代表，都在大会上讲了话。参加大会和示威游行的革命群众指出，今天的大集会大游行是河南革命派再一次声援武汉战友的大示威，也是又一次向中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在中南地区代理人发动总攻击的大誓师。
    广州、南昌、太原、西安、兰州等许多地方，自从谢富治、王力同志光荣回到毛主席身边的消息传来，上街示威游行的革命群众和当地驻军指战员，都分别达到了数十万人次。各地这种大规模的活动，已经成为动员广大群众进一步投入对党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开展大批判、大斗争的强大动力。
    声援武汉地区无产阶级革命派的汹涌澎湃的革命洪流，这几天正继续在全国许多中小城市、县城集镇和广大农村扩展。在黑龙江省的森林城市伊春以及北安、海伦、巴彦，在山西省的雁北、忻县、晋中、晋东南和晋南，在江西省的赣州、景德镇、吉安、九江、抚州和东乡，在西南边疆云南的楚雄、思茅、保山、丽江、文山、玉溪、西双版纳等地，都发出了愤怒声讨武汉地区一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的强大声音。西双版纳傣族自治州和楚雄彝族自治州的革命群众以及当地驻军，都分别举行了上万人的集会游行。西双版纳的革命群众说，高山遮不住金色的太阳，路远难不倒雄鹰的翅膀，我们永远同武汉和全国的革命派战友战斗在一起。居住在独龙河谷的独龙族社员们说：武汉和独龙江虽然远隔千山万水，但是我们的心和武汉革命战友的心紧紧连在一起。在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，没有越不过的高山，没有过不去的大江，没有打不倒的敌人。武汉和全国亿万革命群众的铁拳头，必将把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人彻底打倒！
    全国各地支援武汉革命派斗争的大规模群众运动表明，各地亿万军民对武汉革命派的大无畏精神和果敢行动无限敬佩，对中国的赫鲁晓夫以及党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派无比仇恨。各地革命群众从武汉的斗争中得到了一次最生动的阶级斗争教育和最深刻的两条路线斗争的教育，它正在广泛地动员着全国人民的革命积极性，鼓舞和激励着全国人民把史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
