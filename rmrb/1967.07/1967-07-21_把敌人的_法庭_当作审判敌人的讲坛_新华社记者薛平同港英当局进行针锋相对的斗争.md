New Xinhua News Agency reporter Xuē Píng engaged in a head-on struggle with the Hong Kong British authorities.

	New Xinhua News Agency reporter Xuē Píng, on July 19, with the great fearlessness of the Chinese nation, fought tenaciously and head-on with the enemy in the so-called "court" of the Hong Kong British fascist authorities. He delivered a lengthy speech with righteous indignation, turning the enemy's "court" into a platform to judge the evil British imperialism.

	Xuē Píng was illegally abducted by the Hong Kong British fascist authorities on July 11 while conducting normal reporting activities in the Wan Chai district. The Hong Kong British authorities, fearing that their bloody suppression of Chinese compatriots would be exposed, beat Xuē Píng after abducting him and concocted charges to throw him into a dark prison. However, Xuē Píng remained unyielding, fighting bravely and unyieldingly both in the enemy's "police station" and "court" to defend the dignity of the Chinese nation and to uphold the boundless flame of Mao Zedong Thought.

	On July 19, during his second so-called "trial" by the "Hong Kong District Court," Xuē Píng stepped onto the witness stand, stood tall, and declared in a clear voice, "I am a reporter for the Xinhua News Agency of the People's Republic of China!" He solemnly declared, "I swear allegiance to my great socialist motherland!" He then delivered a lengthy speech with righteous indignation, tearing apart the Hong Kong British authorities' so-called "democracy" and "freedom" in their own "court."

	Xuē Píng said, "I am a Xinhua News Agency reporter. On July 11, 1967, the Hong Kong British authorities' 'riot police' suppressed my patriotic compatriots in the Wan Chai district. At that time, I was assigned to cover the scene. When I arrived at the scene, the Hong Kong British 'riot police' charged at me, with a British police officer leading the way. I retreated into a side street, but he chased after me and illegally abducted me. I showed my press card, but he ignored it, taking my press card and camera. I protested, I protested repeatedly, but he started beating me, and directed a squad of more than ten 'riot police' to surround and beat me. Fists, batons, and gun butts rained down on my body, head, chest, waist, and spine. My hands, chest, waist, and spine were all injured, and I was bleeding. My clothes were covered in blood. I strongly protest the Hong Kong British authorities' illegal detention of Xinhua News Agency reporters; I strongly protest the Hong Kong British authorities' trampling of press freedom; I strongly protest the British police officer and the 'riot police' under his command for beating me. I demand that I be immediately released unconditionally, that the Hong Kong British authorities apologize to me, admit their wrongdoing, and publicly apologize, punish the culprits, and ensure that such incidents do not happen again."

	Xuē Píng continued, "When I was arrested and taken to the Wan Chai police station, I was beaten again and all my belongings were taken. To fabricate charges against me, the Wan Chai police station also seized my reporting notebook and mask, thinking that these two items would be their lifelines, thinking that they could pin fabricated charges on me. However, these two items are evidence of the Hong Kong British authorities' suppression of my compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon."

	When Xuē Píng said this, the "judge" became nervous and fearful, repeatedly stopping Xuē Píng from continuing. Even the "court" interpreter dared not translate the word "abduction" to the "judge," and was immediately rebuked by Xuē Píng. Although the "judge" insisted that what Xuē Píng said was irrelevant to the "case" and tried to stop him from speaking, the more the enemy did not want to hear, the more Xuē Píng wanted to say, and he shouted "protest" several times, protesting that he was not allowed to speak.

	Xuē Píng, ignoring the "judge's" obstruction, continued, "It must be pointed out that the Hong Kong British authorities' abduction of Xinhua News Agency reporters is not an isolated incident; it is a provocation against my socialist motherland!"

	The "judge" heard only two sentences before becoming furious, forgetting his usual boasts of "fairness," "law," "democracy," and "freedom," and personally stopped Xuē Píng from continuing, saying, "Only talk about your personal matters; in short, it is about the facts of that night." Xuē Píng immediately pointed out sternly, "What I said is completely relevant to this matter."

	Xuē Píng continued, "Since May, the Hong Kong British authorities have dispatched police cars and agents around the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch, threatening and provoking Xinhua News Agency staff. On May 11, Hong Kong police beat Xinhua News Agency reporters in San Po Kong. Just two months later, they abducted and beat Xinhua News Agency reporters in Wan Chai. At that time, in addition to Xinhua News Agency reporters, there were other reporters covering the scene and taking photos. But the Hong Kong police only abducted Xinhua News Agency reporters, clearly indicating that this action was organized, planned, and premeditated. I am very angry about the Hong Kong British authorities' provocations, and the Hong Kong British authorities must accept my four demands."

	Xuē Píng then spoke about how, under the influence of the Cultural Revolution in the motherland, Hong Kong compatriots were launching a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. At this point, the "judge" was even more terrified, trying his best to stop Xuē Píng from continuing. The "judge" said, "You can only talk about the relevant matters of that night; my duty is to listen to the two charges against you."

	Xuē Píng sternly refuted, "This matter is not isolated; it is a provocation by the Hong Kong British authorities against my great socialist motherland!"

	The "judge," enraged, said, "Now it is an accusation against you, a trial of you; you can only talk about the truth of the facts."

	Xuē Píng immediately pointed out, "Of course, it is the truth of the facts." He said, "Hong Kong compatriots, under the encouragement of the Cultural Revolution in the motherland, have launched a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They love their motherland and love the great leader Chairman Mao. The Hong Kong British authorities think that they can suppress this high tide with high-pressure tactics, but this is not possible. Hong Kong compatriots have the freedom to love their motherland and the great leader Chairman Mao, and the freedom to study and propagate Mao Zedong Thought."

	The "judge" continued to obstruct, but Xuē Píng insisted on continuing, "I reiterate, the Hong Kong British authorities' abduction of Xinhua News Agency reporters is a serious provocation against my great socialist motherland. The Hong Kong British authorities must release me unconditionally, apologize to me, admit their guilt..." The "judge" at this point interrupted him repeatedly.

	During this illegal "trial," the Hong Kong British "court" was surrounded by police, and the atmosphere was tense. Unarmed Xuē Píng was surrounded by three police officers, and many Chinese and foreign reporters came to court to listen to the "trial." The Hong Kong British fascist authorities, in order to fabricate charges against Xuē Píng, dispatched "Superintendent" Morris and four senior police officers to act as "witnesses." Although they were used to fabricating facts and framing revolutionary masses, they were trembling on the witness stand. Xuē Píng immediately refuted their lies on the spot, pointing out that what they said was "completely fabricated" and "completely inconsistent with the facts."

	The charges fabricated by the Hong Kong British authorities against Xuē Píng were: 1. On July 11, in the Wan Chai district, he participated in an "illegal assembly"; 2. At the same time and place, as a member of the "threatening assembly," he threatened "Superintendent" Morris, making him feel that there might be "disruption of public order." After Xuē Píng was illegally detained and taken to the Wan Chai police station, he personally wrote two protest letters, which he read aloud in court on July 19.

	Under Xuē Píng's brave and head-on struggle, the Hong Kong British "judge" revealed his true colors and was in a state of panic. Finally, he arbitrarily "sentenced" Xuē Píng to two years in a dark prison for the so-called "charges." When Xuē Píng heard this absurd "sentence," he stood up calmly and declared with righteous indignation, "I protest! I protest your abduction of Xinhua News Agency reporters! I protest your illegal trial! If you continue to be enemies of the Chinese people, you will not have a good ending!" After Xuē Píng's stern protest, he walked out of this imperialist "court" with his head held high.

    把敌人的“法庭”当作审判敌人的讲坛
    新华社记者薛平同港英当局进行针锋相对的斗争
    新华社香港二十日电  新华社香港分社记者薛平同志，十九日以中华民族的大无畏精神，在港英法西斯当局的“法庭”上，同敌人进行了顽强的针锋相对的斗争。他义正词严地发表长篇演说，把敌人的“法庭”，作为审判万恶的英帝国主义的讲坛。
    薛平是在七月十一日在湾仔区进行正常采访活动时被港英法西斯当局无理绑架的。港英当局害怕它们血腥镇压中国同胞的暴行被公诸于世，在绑架薛平后对他进行了毒打，并千方百计地罗织“罪名”，将他投入黑狱。但是，薛平同志威武不屈，为了维护中华民族的尊严，为了捍卫光焰无际的毛泽东思想，不论是在敌人的“警署”，还是在敌人的“法院”，他都英勇地不屈不挠地进行了斗争。
    十九日，薛平同志第二次被所谓“香港地方法院”无理“审讯”时，他走上证人台，昂首站立，朗声说道：“我是中华人民共和国国家通讯社新华社记者！”他庄严说：“我向伟大的社会主义祖国宣誓！”接着，他义正词严地发表了长篇演说，就在港英当局的“法院”内，将港英的所谓“民主”“自由”的遮羞布撕得粉碎。
    薛平同志说：“我是新华社记者，一九六七年七月十一日，港英当局‘防暴队’在湾仔地区镇压我爱国同胞。当时我奉命到现场采访，当到现场时，港英‘防暴队’向我冲来，前头是一个英国警官，当时我退入一条横街，但他竟然冲过来，将我非法绑架。当时我出示记者证，但他不理，抢去了我的记者证和照相机。我抗议，我一再抗议，他竟然动手打我，而且指挥一队十多人的‘防暴队’围着我打，拳头、警棍、枪托如雨点般地打在我身上、头上、胸部、腰部、脊骨。我手、胸、腰、脊骨都受了伤，而且流血，我身上衣服都有血迹。我在这里最最强烈抗议港英当局无理拘捕新华社记者；最最强烈抗议港英当局践踏新闻自由；最最强烈抗议英国警官与其指挥下的‘防暴队’对我进行毒打。我坚决要求立即无条件将我释放，港英当局要向我赔罪认错，公开道歉，严惩凶手，保证以后不再发生同样事件。”
    薛平同志继续说：“在我被捕入湾仔警署时，我再次受到毒打，并被取走了我身上的全部东西。为了罗织我的所谓罪名，湾仔警署又抢去我的采访记录本和口罩，以为这样就拾到两根救命草，以为这样就可将莫须有的罪名加在我身上，但是这两件东西只是港英当局镇压我港九同胞的罪证。”
    薛平讲到这里时，“法官”心虚恐惧，三番四次地制止薛平讲下去。甚至那个“法庭”翻译对“绑架”一词都不敢转译给“法官”，当场受到薛平的严正斥责。虽然“法官”硬说薛平所说的与本“案”无关，想要阻止他讲话，但是，敌人越不愿意听，薛平越要说，并数度高喊“抗议不准我说话”。
    薛平同志不顾“法官”的阻挠继续说：“必须指出，港英当局绑架新华社记者不是偶然的，这是对我社会主义祖国的一种挑衅行为！”
    “法官”只听了两句话，就气急败坏，他顾不得平时口头上炫耀的什么“公平法律”、“民主”和“自由”之类的东西，竟赤膊上阵，制止薛平再讲下去，说什么“只讲你本人之事，总之，是当晚所发生之事实。”薛平当即严正指出：“我所讲的话，完全与此事有关。”
    薛平同志继续说：“自从五月以来，港英当局就派警车、特务在新华社香港分社周围，对新华社人员进行恐吓、挑衅。五月十一日，港英警察在新蒲岗殴打新华社记者，刚刚两个月后，又在湾仔绑架、毒打新华社记者。当时，除新华社记者外，还有其他记者在现场采访、拍照。但港英警察只绑架新华社记者，显然此次行动是有组织、有计划、有预谋的。对于港英的挑衅行为，我感到非常愤怒，港英当局必须接受我提出的四项要求。”
    薛平接着谈到在祖国无产阶级文化大革命影响下，香港爱国同胞正掀起活学活用毛主席著作的高潮。这时，那个“法官”更是害怕得要命，极力阻止薛平再说下去，“法官”说：“你只能讲该晚有关的事情；我的职责是听取你所被控的两罪有关的事情。”
    薛平严词驳斥说：“此事不是孤立的，是港英当局对我社会主义伟大祖国的挑衅行为！”
    “法官”恼羞成怒地说：“现在是控告你，审讯你，你只能讲事实的真相。”
    薛平当即指出：“当然是事实的真相。”他说：“香港同胞在祖国无产阶级文化大革命的鼓舞下，掀起活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，他们热爱祖国，热爱伟大领袖毛主席，港英当局以为用高压手段，就可将这个高潮压下去，这是办不到的。香港同胞有热爱祖国、热爱伟大领袖毛主席的自由，有学习、宣传毛泽东思想的自由。”
    “法官”继续阻止，薛平同志坚持说下去：“我重申一次，港英当局绑架新华社记者，是对我伟大社会主义祖国严重的挑衅行为，港英当局必须无条件释放，向我赔罪，认罪……。”“法官”这时急得连声打断他的话。
    在这次非法“审讯”时，港英“法院”内外警员林立，气氛紧张。手无寸铁的薛平同志被三个警员团团围着，许多中外记者到庭听“审”。港英法西斯当局为了罗织薛平同志的“罪名”，派出“警司”摩士和四个高级警官担任“证人”，他们虽惯于捏造事实、陷害革命群众，但是在证人台上却战战兢兢。薛平当场严厉地驳斥了他们的谎言，指出他们所说的“完全是编造”，“完全不符合事实”。
    港英当局罗织给薛平同志的莫名其妙的“罪名”是：一、七月十一日在湾仔地区作“非法集会”；二、同时同地，“身为恐吓集会的一分子”，恐吓“警司”摩士，使其感到可能有“破坏公众安宁”的事发生。薛平同志被无理拘捕往“湾仔警署”后，曾亲笔写下两封抗议书，十九日他在“法庭”上高声宣读了这两封抗议书。
    港英的“法官”在薛平同志英勇的针锋相对的斗争下，丑态毕露，狼狈万分，最后，竟然横蛮地“宣判”所谓“罪名成立”，疯狂地宣布把薛平同志投入黑狱两年。薛平同志听到这个荒谬的“判决”时，镇定地站起身来，义正词严地说：“我抗议！抗议你们绑架新华社记者！抗议你们非法审讯！如果你们继续与中国人民为敌，你们决没有好下场！”薛平同志严正地表示抗议后，昂首阔步离开这个帝国主义的黑“庭”。
