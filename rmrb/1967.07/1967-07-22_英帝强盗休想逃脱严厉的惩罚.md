The British authorities in Hong Kong, after brazenly abducting our New China News Agency Hong Kong branch reporter Xue Ping, on July 19th, actually sentenced him to two years in prison. On the 20th, they also conducted illegal "interrogations" of New China News Agency Hong Kong branch reporters Chen Fenying and Chen Demu, as well as five patriotic reporters in Hong Kong. This is another fascist persecution incident created by the British imperialist bandits in Hong Kong, a serious political provocation against the people of Hong Kong and the 700 million people of China.

The British imperialist bandits' political persecution of the New China News Agency and Hong Kong patriotic reporters has been long planned. Over the past two months, British imperialism in Hong Kong has been killing and burning, committing all manner of evil. They are guilty and fearful of the New China News Agency Hong Kong branch and Hong Kong patriotic newspapers exposing their fascist atrocities; they hate the patriotic newspapers' propagation of Mao Zedong Thought to the core. The British fascist authorities regard the New China News Agency and patriotic newspapers as thorns in their sides. They have dispatched military police and "riot squads" to repeatedly create serious incidents of assaulting, searching New China News Agency reporters, and intimidating patriotic newspapers. British imperialism has torn off the mask of so-called "freedom of the press," using the most despicable means to persecute our New China News Agency and patriotic newspaper reporters. They think that by doing so, they can silence the New China News Agency reporters and Hong Kong patriotic reporters, cover up the eyes and ears of the world, and thus more brazenly harm our Hong Kong compatriots. This is sheer delusion.

No matter how much persecution the British imperialists carry out in Hong Kong, they will never be able to stop the spread of the just voices of the 400,000 patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. Every patriotic compatriot in Hong Kong is a witness to the British imperialists' fascist bloody atrocities. They will definitely report to the world the heinous crimes of the British imperialist bandits.

Let us frankly tell the British imperialists: your fascist atrocities cannot be covered up, the anti-British and anti-fascist struggle of the Hong Kong compatriots cannot be suppressed, and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought cannot be blocked. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us:

"All dark forces that harm the people must be exposed, and all revolutionary struggles of the people must be praised." For the blood debts you have owed the Chinese people for more than a hundred years, for your fascist atrocities against our Hong Kong compatriots, we will thoroughly expose and settle accounts with you; for the heroic struggle of the Hong Kong patriotic compatriots against British imperialism, for their firm will to be loyal to the motherland and to the great leader Chairman Mao, we will enthusiastically praise them. Your fascist atrocities cannot suppress the voice of truth, nor can they save you from your doomed failure. On the contrary, they will only "lift a rock to drop on your own feet," further exposing your paper tiger nature of being fierce on the outside but cowardly within.

Xue Ping, Chen Fenying, and other comrades, in the enemy's "police station" and "court," with great courage, fought back against the British fascist authorities in a head-on struggle. They turned the enemy's "court" into a platform for judging the enemy, using iron-clad facts to denounce the British imperialists' fascist atrocities, greatly boosting the morale of the patriotic compatriots and greatly dampening the arrogance of the British imperialists. They have set another brilliant example of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the struggle against the enemy.

An eye for an eye. For the British imperialists' provocations, the Chinese people must give a corresponding counterattack. The News Department of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with authorization, announced that due to the British authorities in Hong Kong's unreasonable persecution of New China News Agency Hong Kong branch reporters and other patriotic reporters, the Chinese government has decided to restrict the freedom of movement of the Reuters correspondent in Beijing and to await further handling. This is a serious warning to British imperialism. The Chinese people have always kept their word. British imperialism's brazen provocations will absolutely not escape the severe punishment of the great Chinese people!

    英帝强盗休想逃脱严厉的惩罚
    本报评论员
    港英当局在悍然绑架我新华社香港分社记者薛平之后，七月十九日，竟对他非法“判决”入狱两年。二十日，又对新华社香港分社记者陈凤英、陈德穆和香港的五名爱国记者进行了非法“审讯”。这是港英帝国主义强盗制造的又一宗法西斯迫害事件，是对我香港同胞和七亿中国人民的严重政治挑衅。
    港英法西斯强盗这次对新华社和香港爱国记者的政治迫害，是蓄谋已久的。两个多月来，英帝国主义在香港杀人放火，无恶不作。他们作贼心虚，对新华社香港分社和香港爱国报纸揭露它们的法西斯暴行，怕得要死；对爱国报纸宣传毛泽东思想，恨得要命。港英法西斯当局把新华社和爱国报纸视为眼中钉，肉中刺。它出动军警和“防暴队”，接二连三地制造殴打、搜查新华社记者和恫吓爱国报纸的严重事件。英帝国主义撕下了所谓“新闻自由”的遮羞布，使出了最卑鄙的手段，对我新华社和爱国报纸记者横加迫害。他们以为，这样就可以封住新华社记者和香港爱国记者的口，掩尽天下人的耳目，以便他们更加肆无忌惮地残害我香港同胞。这完全是痴心妄想。
    无论英帝国主义在香港进行什么样的迫害，都绝对阻挡不了四百万香港爱国同胞正义呼声的传播。每一个香港爱国同胞都是英帝国主义法西斯血腥暴行的见证人。他们一定要向全世界控诉英帝国主义强盗的滔天罪行。
    老实告诉英帝国主义：你们的法西斯暴行是掩盖不了的，香港同胞的反英抗暴斗争是压不下去的，战无不胜的毛泽东思想是封锁不住的。我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导说：
  “一切危害人民群众的黑暗势力必须暴露之，一切人民群众的革命斗争必须歌颂之”。对于你们一百多年来欠下中国人民的累累血债，对于你们迫害我香港同胞的法西斯暴行，我们就是要彻底揭露，彻底清算；对于香港爱国同胞反英抗暴的英勇斗争，对于他们忠于祖国、忠于伟大领袖毛主席的坚强意志，我们就是要热情地歌颂。你们的法西斯暴行，压制不住真理的声音，挽救不了你们彻底失败的命运。相反，只能是“搬起石头打自己的脚”，更加暴露你们色厉内荏的纸老虎本质。
    薛平、陈凤英等同志在敌人的“警署”里、“法庭”上，以大无畏的英雄气概，同港英法西斯当局进行了针锋相对的斗争。他们把敌人的“法庭”变成了审判敌人的讲坛，用铁的事实痛斥了英帝国主义的法西斯暴行，大长爱国同胞的志气，大灭港英帝国主义的威风。他们树立了在对敌斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的又一个光辉榜样。
    来而不往非礼也。对于英帝国主义的挑衅，中国人民必须给予相应的回击。我国外交部新闻司受权宣布，由于港英当局对新华社香港分社记者和其他爱国记者进行无理迫害，中国政府决定限制英国路透社驻京记者的行动自由，要他听候处理。这是对英帝国主义的一个严重警告。中国人民从来是说话算数的。英帝国主义这样猖狂挑衅，绝对逃脱不了伟大中国人民的严厉惩罚！
