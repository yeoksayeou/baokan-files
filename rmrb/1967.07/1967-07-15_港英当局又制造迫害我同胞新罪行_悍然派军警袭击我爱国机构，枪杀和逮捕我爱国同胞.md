The Hong Kong British fascist authorities today, in the early hours of the morning, sent out hundreds of British troops, "riot squads," and armed police to launch a mad armed attack on the Kowloon Dockyard Workers' Union and the Hung Hom Workers' Children's School. According to the Hong Kong British "Radio Hong Kong," in this attack, one patriot was shot dead, and another 81 patriots were illegally arrested.

The Hong Kong British authorities' sudden armed attack on the Kowloon Dockyard Workers' Union and the Hung Hom Workers' Children's School was entirely premeditated. Early this morning at around 1:00 AM, the Hong Kong British authorities sent out a large number of British troops to surround the area where the union and school are located in Hung Hom with barbed wire. They also dispatched military police to guard every street entrance. At the same time, large numbers of "riot squads" and police were stationed on the streets near the union and school, as well as on the rooftops of buildings. After completing their deployment, they immediately launched the attack. They recklessly fired a large number of bullets, tear gas, and wooden bullets at the fourth-floor union and the adjacent workers' children's school. They also sent armed military police to ram the doors of the union and school, spraying poison powder inside through the gaps. The brave and unyielding workers and students, as well as teachers, fought back fiercely with glass bottles and other makeshift weapons. They remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and were determined to fight to the end against the brutal enemy. When one person fell, another immediately took their place. They fought bravely for over two hours. After breaking through the walls into the Hung Hom Workers' Children's School around 3:30 AM, the Hong Kong British military police then attacked the union from the rooftop. Around 4:30 AM, the thugs broke down the door and entered the union, illegally arresting the workers inside the union and the teachers and students in the school. The brave workers and teachers were taken away in police cars, shouting slogans such as "Long Live Chairman Mao."

After the Hong Kong British military police forcibly entered the union and school, all the equipment and documents inside the union were completely destroyed, and the six classrooms and telephone in the school were all damaged, with bullet marks and bloodstains everywhere. Inside and outside the union and school, countless bullet casings and tear gas canisters were found. What is particularly intolerable is that the Hong Kong British fascist military police savagely tore down all the portraits of Chairman Mao and smashed the statues of Chairman Mao, and all the quotations from Chairman Mao posted on the walls were torn down.

The patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon declared: We must resolutely give a double blowback to the Hong Kong British authorities' mad suppression and severely punish them!

According to a report from New China News Agency in Hong Kong on the 14th, the Hong Kong British fascist authorities on the 13th brazenly kidnapped the teaching staff of the patriotic school, Po Chai Middle School, in broad daylight and seized a car from the school.

At around 6:00 PM on the 13th, three teaching staff members of Po Chai Middle School were driving out in a car. When they passed by the North Point area, the Hong Kong British fascist authorities dispatched "riot vehicles" to follow and intercept them, conducting an illegal search. They then illegally kidnapped the three teaching staff members and one driver on the pretext of "riding in a 'wanted car.'" They also seized the car they were riding in. After the incident, the families of these teaching staff members went to the police station twice to negotiate, but the Hong Kong British authorities still refused to release their relatives.

The teachers and students of Po Chai Middle School expressed great indignation at the Hong Kong British fascist authorities' pirate behavior. They immediately issued an emergency statement, strongly protesting against the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities, and put forward four solemn demands to the Hong Kong British authorities: immediately release the kidnapped personnel, return the seized car, apologize, and guarantee that such incidents will not happen again.

    港英当局又制造迫害我同胞新罪行
    悍然派军警袭击我爱国机构，枪杀和逮捕我爱国同胞
    据新华社香港十四日电　港英法西斯当局今天凌晨派出数百名英军、“防暴队”和武装警察，疯狂地武装袭击九龙船坞劳工联合会和红磡劳工子弟学校。据港英“香港广播电台”供认，在这次袭击中，有一名爱国同胞被枪杀，另有八十一名爱国同胞被非法逮捕。
    港英当局对九龙船坞劳工联合会和红磡劳工子弟学校的突然武装袭击，完全是有预谋的。今天凌晨一时多，港英就派出大批英军，用铁丝网重重包围这个工会和学校所在的红磡地区，并派军警严密把守每个街道口。与此同时，大批“防暴队”和警察布满了工会和学校附近的街道以及楼宇的天台，部署完毕后就立即发动进攻。他们向四楼的工会和隔邻的劳工子弟学校猖狂地发射了大量枪弹、催泪弹和木弹，并且派出武装军警分别撞击工会和学校的大门，由门缝向里面喷射毒粉。英勇不屈的工人和学生、教师们纷纷用玻璃瓶等作武器，狠狠地回击港英法西斯暴徒。他们牢记毛主席的教导，决心与残暴的敌人血战到底。前面的人倒下了，后面的人马上接上去。他们英勇奋战了两个多小时。港英军警在凌晨三时半左右破墙攻入红磡劳工子弟学校之后，随即上天台自上而下向工会攻击。大约四时半，暴徒破门闯入工会，非法逮捕了在工会内的工人和学校里的师生。英勇的工人和师生被暴徒押上警车时，不断高呼“毛主席万岁”等口号。
    工会和学校被港英军警武力闯入之后，工会屋内所有设备和文件，全部被捣毁，学校的六个课室和电话也全部被破坏，到处留下累累弹痕和斑斑血迹。在工会和学校内外，还发现有无数的子弹壳和催泪弹壳。特别令人不能容忍的是，港英法西斯军警竟野蛮地撕毁了屋内所有的毛主席像和砸碎了毛主席塑像，墙壁上张贴的毛主席语录也全部被撕毁。
    港九爱国同胞表示：对于港英当局的疯狂镇压，一定要坚决地给以加倍的还击，狠狠的惩罚！
    据新华社香港十四日电　港英法西斯当局十三日竟在光天化日之下，非法绑架爱国学校培侨中学的教职人员，并劫去这个学校的汽车一辆。
    十三日下午六时许，培侨中学教职人员三人，乘坐汽车外出。当行经北角附近时，港英法西斯当局竟派遣“防暴车”跟踪拦截，进行非法搜查，并以“乘坐‘被通缉汽车’”的莫须有罪名，非法绑架了这三名教职人员和一名司机，还劫去他们乘坐的一辆汽车。事件发生后，这些教职人员的家属虽然两次到警署交涉，但港英当局仍拒绝释放他们的亲人。
    培侨中学教师、学生对港英法西斯当局这一海盗行为，表示极大的愤怒。他们立即发表紧急声明，强烈抗议港英当局的法西斯暴行，并向港英当局提出了立即释放被绑架的人员、送还被劫汽车、道歉以及保证不再发生同样事件等四项严正要求。
