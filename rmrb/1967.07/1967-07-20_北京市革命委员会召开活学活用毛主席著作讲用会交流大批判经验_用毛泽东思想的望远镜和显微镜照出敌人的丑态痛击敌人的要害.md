The Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee held a study session on applying Chairman Mao's works today to share experiences in the revolutionary criticism movement. The session emphasized the importance of prioritizing proletarian politics and Mao Zedong Thought, and using Mao Zedong Thought to guide the criticism movement.

A new wave of intense criticism, exposure, and struggle against the capitalist roaders within the Party and the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique is surging in the capital. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have taken up the mighty weapon of Mao Zedong Thought and joined the battlefield of revolutionary criticism, becoming the main force in the movement. Today's study session was attended by over 1,300 representatives from the Beijing Municipal Workers' Congress, Peasants' Congress, higher education Red Guards, secondary school Red Guards, and various systems. Representatives from the industrial and transportation systems shared their experiences in applying Chairman Mao's works during the criticism movement. The session demonstrated that the revolutionary criticism movement is a great classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. By studying and applying Chairman Mao's works during the criticism movement, revolutionary forces can be better armed and tempered, and the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought can be established.

The Red Rebel United Headquarters of the Beijing Foreign Language Printing Plant reported on how they firmly followed Chairman Mao's directives on the direction of struggle, using Mao Zedong Thought as a political telescope and microscope to observe issues, expose the true colors of the capitalist roaders within the Party, unite the majority of the masses, and achieve revolutionary unity.

With the help of the People's Liberation Army comrades who came to support the left and support work in the plant, the revolutionary masses of the plant repeatedly studied Chairman Mao's latest instructions on the Cultural Revolution and his teachings on class struggle, proletarian dictatorship, and correctly handling contradictions between the people. They clearly recognized that under the conditions of proletarian dictatorship, the main contradiction to be resolved is between the broad revolutionary masses and the capitalist roaders within the Party. They firmly grasped the direction of struggle, using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon, and launched a mass criticism movement against the capitalist roaders within the Party, the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, and their agents within the plant. Over the past three months, they exposed the fact that the capitalist roaders within the Party and the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique directly controlled the plant's printing plans, instructed the capitalist roaders within the plant to fiercely resist the publication of Chairman Mao's works, and mobilized all human and material resources to print large quantities of revisionist trash like "Self-Cultivation." They also engaged in capitalist management within the plant and practiced bourgeois dictatorship over the workers. Following Chairman Mao's teaching of "unity-criticism-unity," they sincerely conducted heart-to-heart talks with class brothers who had been deceived, doing painstaking ideological work. Thus, the deceived masses returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and the handful of class enemies became increasingly isolated. The revolutionary forces grew stronger in the criticism movement, and nine revolutionary organizations in the plant achieved unity. Over 80% of the employees in the plant joined the united revolutionary organization, the Red Rebel United Headquarters. The revolutionary criticism quickly raised the class consciousness of the employees, greatly promoting production and work. In the three months since the criticism movement began, the number of Chairman Mao's works printed in various foreign languages exceeded the total printed from 1962 to 1964 by 80%.

The proletarian revolutionary forces of the Beijing Foodstuffs General Factory reported on how they acted according to Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasped the direction of struggle, and persistently carried out the revolutionary criticism experience. After seizing power from the capitalist roaders within the factory, some people thought that the capitalist roaders within the Party and the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique were "dead tigers" and did not need to be criticized. They studied Chairman Mao's personally drafted "Sixteen Points" and his brilliant works such as "The Situation and Our Policy After the Victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan," and realized that these elements were still alive and dreaming of regaining their lost "paradise." If they were not politically, ideologically, and theoretically criticized and exposed, once the time was ripe, they would form a counter-revolutionary alliance again and launch a counterattack against us. The revolutionary forces would suffer, China would change color, and millions of heads would roll. After studying, the revolutionary forces recognized the direction of struggle, overcame the ideological obstacles to criticism, and resolutely did not engage in "internal warfare," throwing themselves wholeheartedly into the revolutionary criticism movement.

The Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the Beijing Fifth Construction Company reported on their experience of uniting with groups that had principled differences to jointly criticize and struggle against the capitalist roaders within the Party, uniting over 90% of the masses. Their experience was that as long as the revolutionary forces believed in the masses and did not consider themselves "always correct," they could unite more masses to jointly fight against the capitalist roaders within the Party.

The experience of the East Is Red Brigade of the Shijingshan Power Plant in examining, identifying, and liberating cadres according to Chairman Mao's cadre policy during the criticism movement was also shared. Due to the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line, there was a deep rift between the cadres and the masses in the plant during the Cultural Revolution. After seizing power, some people demanded that the cadres be pulled out one by one for struggle. The leadership core of the East Is Red Brigade grasped this active thought, seriously organizing everyone to study the part on cadre issues in the "Sixteen Points" and Chairman Mao's discussions on cadre issues. Through study, they clearly recognized that cadres must undergo class analysis, and we only need to overthrow the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. For cadres who made mistakes, the policy of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient" must be adopted. In about two months, they held over a hundred large and small criticism meetings, directing the struggle at the handful of capitalist roaders within the Party. During the criticism, many cadres who made mistakes sincerely examined their mistakes, thoroughly exposed the roots of their mistakes, and drew a clear line with the class enemies.

Comrade Zhou Jingfang of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee spoke at the meeting. He said, with Mao Zedong Thought as our telescope and magic mirror, we can expose all the capitalist roaders within the Party, criticize and denounce them, and seize back all the positions they usurped. Studying Chairman Mao's works must be practical and applied in struggle. The new wave of revolutionary criticism is a new wave of the mass movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. We must place the study of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, heavier than everything, and earlier than everything. We must grasp it tightly, never let it go, and see it through to the end, achieving new levels in study and application, and carrying the Cultural Revolution through to the end, making Beijing a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

    北京市革命委员会召开活学活用毛主席著作讲用会交流大批判经验
    用毛泽东思想的望远镜和显微镜照出敌人的丑态痛击敌人的要害
    据新华社十九日讯　北京市革命委员会今天召开活学活用毛主席著作讲用会，交流在革命的大批判运动中突出无产阶级政治，突出毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想统帅大批判运动的经验。
    一个对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和彭真反革命修正主义集团大揭露、大批判、大斗争的新高潮，正在首都蓬勃兴起。广大工农兵群众，奋起毛泽东思想千钧棒，杀上这场革命的大批判的战场，成了大批判的主力部队。今天的讲用会，有北京市工代会、农代会、大专院校红代会、中学红代会和机关系统一千三百多人参加，由工业交通系统的无产阶级革命派介绍他们在大批判中活学活用毛主席著作的经验。讲用会表明，革命的大批判运动是活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂。在大批判中活学活用毛主席著作，就能更好地武装和锻炼革命队伍，树立起毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    北京外文印刷厂红色造反联合总部在会上介绍了他们如何坚定不移地遵照毛主席指出的斗争大方向，用毛泽东思想这个政治上的望远镜、显微镜观察问题，揭开党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的画皮，在大批判中团结了群众的大多数，实现了革命的大联合。
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派，在进厂支左、支工的解放军同志的帮助下，反复学习了毛主席有关文化大革命的最新指示，学习了毛主席关于阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的学说和关于正确区分和处理两类矛盾的教导，明确地认识到，无产阶级专政条件下的革命，所要解决的主要矛盾，是广大革命群众同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾。他们牢牢地掌握斗争的大方向，以毛泽东思想为武器，针对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派、彭真反革命修正主义集团和他们在厂内的代理人，开展了群众性的大批判运动。三个多月来，他们揭发了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派、彭真反革命修正主义集团直接控制工厂的印刷计划，指使厂内的走资本主义道路当权派拚命抵制毛主席著作的出版，却千方百计动员一切人力物力，大印《修养》等修正主义黑货，在厂内大搞资本主义经营，对工人实行资产阶级专政等触目惊心的事实，并且遵照毛主席的“团结——批评——团结”的教导，满腔热忱地对受蒙蔽的阶级兄弟开展谈心活动，进行艰苦细致的思想工作。这样，受蒙蔽的群众纷纷回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，一小撮阶级敌人越来越孤立。革命派的队伍在大批判中不断发展壮大，全厂九个革命组织在大批判中实现了大联合，百分之八十以上的在厂职工参加了全厂统一的革命组织红色造反联合总部。革命的大批判迅速提高了职工的阶级觉悟，大大促进了生产和工作。在开展大批判以来的三个月中，印制的各种外国文字的毛主席著作，就比一九六二年至一九六四年三年印制的总数还多百分之八十。
    北京食品总厂的无产阶级革命派以生动的事实介绍了他们如何按毛泽东思想办事，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，自始至终坚持革命大批判的经验。这个厂的无产阶级革命派在夺了厂里党内走资本主义道路当权派的大权以后，有些人觉得，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和彭真反革命修正主义集团都是“死老虎”，用不着花大力气去批了。他们学习了毛主席亲自主持制定的《十六条》，以及毛主席的《抗日战争胜利后的时局和我们的方针》等光辉著作，认识到这些家伙人还在，心不死，他们无时无刻不在梦想夺回他们失去的“天堂”。如果不把他们从政治上、思想上、理论上批倒、批臭，一旦时机成熟，他们就会重新结成反革命的联盟，向我们进行反攻倒算，我们无产阶级革命派就要遭殃，中国就要改变颜色，千百万人头就要落地。革命派战士经过学习，认清了斗争的大方向，解决了阻碍大批判的思想障碍，坚决不打“内战”，全力投入革命的大批判运动。
    北京市第五建筑公司革命造反总部机关革命造反者，介绍了他们按照毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导，和有原则分歧的群众组织一道联合起来斗批党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，团结了百分之九十以上群众的经验。他们的体会是，革命派只要相信群众，不以“老正确”自居，就一定能够团结更多的群众，一道向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派开火。
    如何按照毛主席的干部政策办事，在大批判中考察、识别和解放干部，是石景山发电厂毛泽东思想东方红兵团在讲用会上介绍的主要经验。由于资产阶级反动路线的影响，在文化大革命中，这个厂的干部群众对立，隔阂很深。革命派夺权之后，有的人曾要求把干部一个个拉出来斗。东方红兵团领导核心抓住这一活思想，认真组织大家学习了《十六条》中关于干部问题的部分，反复学习了毛主席关于干部问题的论述。通过学习，他们明确认识到对干部必须进行阶级分析，我们要打倒的只是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对犯错误的干部必须采取“惩前毖后，治病救人”的方针。他们在大约两个月的时间内，共开了大小批判会百余次，把斗争矛头紧紧指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。在大批判中，许多犯错误的干部都诚恳地检查了自己的错误，狠挖自己犯错误的根源，同阶级敌人划清了界限。
    北京市革命委员会周景方同志在会上讲了话。他说，无产阶级文化大革命的实践告诉我们：掌握了毛泽东思想这个望远镜和照妖镜，我们就能把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派统统揪出来，把他们批倒批臭，夺回他们窃踞的一切阵地。学习毛主席著作必须活学活用，在斗争中学，在斗争中用。革命大批判的新高潮，就是活学活用毛主席著作群众运动的新高潮。我们必须把学习毛主席著作放在高于一切，大于一切，重于一切，先于一切的地位，要大抓特抓，抓住不放，一抓到底，学出新水平，用出新水平，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，把北京市办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
