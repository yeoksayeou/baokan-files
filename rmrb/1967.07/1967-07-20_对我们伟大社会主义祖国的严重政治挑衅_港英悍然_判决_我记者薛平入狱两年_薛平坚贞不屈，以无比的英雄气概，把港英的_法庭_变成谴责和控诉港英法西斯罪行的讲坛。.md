The British authorities in Hong Kong, in defiance of the serious warnings from the Chinese government, have stubbornly opposed the Chinese people. Today, they continued the illegal "trial" of Xue Ping, a reporter from the Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch, and dared to declare him "guilty," unjustly sentencing him to two years in prison. This crime by the British authorities in Hong Kong is a serious political provocation against our great socialist motherland, which the 700 million Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate.

Xue Ping was illegally abducted by the British authorities in Hong Kong at dawn on July 11 in the Wan Chai district while conducting normal interviews. They fabricated charges of "illegal assembly" and "participating in a threatening assembly" against him and illegally prosecuted him.

Today, in the "Victoria Magistrates' Court," Xue Ping stood firm and, with unparalleled heroic spirit, turned the British "court" into a platform for condemning and exposing the crimes of the British fascists. Xue Ping angrily exposed how the British fascist police beat him with batons and gun butts when they abducted him, causing injuries to his hands, head, chest, waist, and spine. When he was taken to the "Eastern District Police Station," he was beaten again.

Xue Ping sternly pointed out that the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, inspired and driven by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our motherland, have launched a high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and love our great leader Chairman Mao even more. The British authorities are trying to use fascist repression to stop the patriotic compatriots from studying and propagating Mao Zedong Thought, and have continuously created bloodshed in Hong Kong, beating, abducting, and persecuting reporters from Xinhua News Agency and patriotic newspapers. However, the British authorities' attempt to suppress the patriotic compatriots' love for Chairman Mao and their enthusiasm for studying and propagating Mao Zedong Thought with all these repressive measures is absolutely impossible!

Finally, Xue Ping sternly demanded of the British authorities: First, immediately and unconditionally release him; second, the British authorities should apologize, admit their mistakes, and compensate for the damages; third, punish the culprits; fourth, guarantee that similar incidents will not happen again. Xue Ping also warned the British authorities: The British authorities' persecution of Xinhua News Agency reporters is a serious provocation against our great socialist motherland, and all serious consequences will be fully borne by the British authorities.

However, the British "judge," in the face of Xue Ping's stern condemnation, still dared to announce "guilt established" and illegally sentenced Xue Ping to two years in prison. At that time, Xue Ping stood up, chest out, and shouted, "I protest! I protest against your abduction of Xinhua News Agency reporters! I protest against your illegal trial! If you continue to oppose the Chinese people, you will not have a good end!"

While illegally sentencing Xue Ping, the British fascist authorities are also preparing to conduct an illegal "trial" on July 20 for Xinhua News Agency reporters Chen Fengying and Chen Demu, who were illegally arrested, and five patriotic reporters. The British fascist authorities' brazen persecution of Xinhua News Agency reporters and patriotic reporters has aroused the great indignation of the patriotic news community and compatriots in Hong Kong. The British imperialists foolishly attempt to use violence to obstruct Xinhua News Agency reporters and patriotic newspaper reporters from exposing their fascist atrocities and to suppress the spread of the great Mao Zedong Thought. This fully exposes their paper tiger's weak essence. However, their plots will never succeed. The great Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. The various foolish actions of British imperialism will only result in "lifting a stone to drop on one's own foot."

    对我们伟大社会主义祖国的严重政治挑衅
    港英悍然“判决”我记者薛平入狱两年
    薛平坚贞不屈，以无比的英雄气概，把港英的“法庭”变成谴责和控诉港英法西斯罪行的讲坛。
    新华社香港十九日电　港英法西斯当局无视我国政府的严重警告，顽固与中国人民为敌，今天竟对新华社香港分社记者薛平继续进行非法“审讯”，胆敢宣称“罪名成立”，无理“判决”薛平入狱两年。港英法西斯当局这一罪行，是对我们伟大社会主义祖国的严重政治挑衅，是七亿中国人民所绝对不能容忍的。
    薛平是七月十一日凌晨在湾仔地区进行正常采访时，被港英法西斯当局无理绑架，并编造了所谓“非法集会”和“参加恐吓性集会”的莫须有“罪名”，非法地加以“控告”。
    薛平今天在“维多利亚地方法院”上，坚贞不屈，以无比英雄的气概，把港英的“法庭”变成谴责和控诉港英法西斯罪行的讲坛。薛平愤怒揭露港英法西斯警察在对他进行绑架时，当场用警棍和枪托毒打他，使他手部、头部、胸部、腰部和脊骨等多处受伤。被绑架至“东区警署”时，又再次被毒打。
    薛平严正指出，香港爱国同胞在祖国无产阶级文化大革命的鼓舞和推动下，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的高潮，更加热爱我们伟大的领袖毛主席。港英当局企图用法西斯的高压手段来遏止爱国同胞学习和宣传毛泽东思想，连续在香港制造血案，并殴打、绑架和迫害新华社记者和爱国报纸记者。但是，港英当局妄想用这一切高压手段把香港爱国同胞热爱毛主席，积极学习和宣传毛泽东思想的高潮压下去，那是绝对办不到的！
    最后，薛平义正词严地向港英当局提出四项严正要求：一、立即无条件释放他；二、港英当局要赔罪、认错和赔偿损失；三、惩办凶手；四、保证今后不再发生同样事件。薛平还警告港英当局：港英当局对新华社记者的迫害是对我们伟大的社会主义祖国的严重挑衅，一切严重后果，完全由港英当局承担。
    但是，港英“法官”在薛平严正的谴责下，仍然不顾一切，悍然宣布“罪名成立”，非法“判决”薛平入狱两年。当时，薛平站起来挺起胸膛，高声说：“我抗议！抗议你们绑架新华社记者！抗议你们非法审讯！如果你们继续与中国人民为敌，你们决没有好下场！”
    港英法西斯当局在非法“判决”薛平的同时，又准备在二十日对无理“逮捕”的新华社记者陈凤英、陈德穆和五名爱国记者进行非法“审讯”。港英法西斯当局这样肆无忌惮地迫害新华社记者和爱国记者的暴行，激起了香港爱国新闻界和各界同胞的无比愤怒。港英帝国主义妄想用暴力来阻挠新华社记者和爱国报纸记者揭露它们的法西斯暴行，妄想用暴力来遏制伟大的毛泽东思想的传播，这充分暴露了它们纸老虎的虚弱本质。但是，它们的这种阴谋是永远不能得逞的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的中国人民是不好惹的，港英帝国主义的种种愚蠢行为，必将是“搬起石头打自己的脚”。
