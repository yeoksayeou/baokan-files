The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front issued a memorandum on July 23, exposing in detail the series of heinous crimes committed by U.S. imperialism in its aggression against Laos over the past five years. The memorandum calls on the Lao people to be vigilant against U.S. imperialism and urges the Lao people to persist in the long-term patriotic struggle against U.S. imperialism to thoroughly defeat it.

The memorandum points out that U.S. imperialism is the most brutal aggressor, the greatest war criminal, and the destroyer of the 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Laos issue.

The memorandum points out that U.S. imperialism's consistent policy in Laos is interference and aggression, enslaving the Lao people, and turning Laos into a new type of U.S. colony and military base. The United States uses military force to attack the Lao Patriotic Front, raids the Lao liberation areas, and advances its aggressive actions and various war actions against the Lao people and to destroy Laos' peace. In recent years, under the command of U.S. imperialism, the pro-U.S. Lao forces have launched thousands of large-scale infiltration and "sweeping" attacks on the Lao liberation areas. In 1964, U.S. jet planes from the U.S. Seventh Fleet and U.S. military bases in Thailand and South Vietnam began bombing and strafing the Lao liberation areas. Thus, the United States directly participated in the "special war" in Laos with its air force. After June 1964, the United States expanded the scale of bombing of the central and southern Lao liberation areas. In just the first four months of this year, U.S. planes have flown more than ten thousand sorties. Since early 1966, the United States has carried out another escalation of the war: using B-52 bombers to bomb the Lao liberation areas, especially the central and southern regions. The United States has also used napalm, phosphorus bombs, and cluster bombs, and even repeatedly dropped chemical poisons over the Lao liberation areas.

The memorandum states that in recent years, U.S. imperialism has propped up the pro-U.S. puppet regime in Vientiane and grossly interfered in Laos' internal affairs. The United States was forced to accept the 1962 peace settlement on the Laos issue and had to recognize the National Unity Government that includes the Lao Patriotic Front. However, in April 1963, it instructed its lackeys to assassinate Prince Souphanouvong, the Foreign Minister of the National Unity Government who was fighting for peace and neutrality. In April 1964, the United States went further by instigating the right-wing military clique of Kouprasith to stage a military coup, overthrowing the National Unity Government, and establishing a new pro-U.S. puppet regime in Vientiane.

The memorandum further exposes that the United States, under the pretext of "aid," has carried out rampant aggression in Laos. The memorandum points out that the United States provides "aid" to the Vientiane puppet regime based on a series of unequal treaties and agreements. These agreements guarantee the United States the right to export U.S. goods, purchase Lao raw materials, and develop Lao resources with priority, the right to set prices and determine "aid" items, the right to control and use "aid," and the right to stop "aid" at any time. These agreements also give the United States the right to establish military and economic representative teams directly under the U.S. Embassy in Laos, enjoying diplomatic privileges. These agreements also guarantee the United States the right to arbitrarily control, dominate, and monopolize the politics, military, economy, finance, banking, and commerce of Laos, turning the country into a market for U.S. goods. Clearly, these agreements place Laos completely in a subordinate position to the United States.

The memorandum states that according to incomplete statistics published by the United States and the Vientiane puppet regime, the United States has provided over six hundred million dollars in "aid" to the pro-U.S. forces in Laos over the past five years, of which approximately three hundred and eighty million dollars is military "aid," accounting for more than sixty-four percent. The proportion of U.S. "aid" in the annual budget of the Vientiane puppet regime is eighty-five to ninety percent, and in the military budget, it is one hundred percent. These figures do not include the secret military "aid" that the United States directly provides to the pro-U.S. forces. The fact that military "aid" has always been the main part of U.S. "aid" exposes the military nature of U.S. "aid" and the U.S. policy of using force and aggression against Laos. As a result of U.S. "aid," Laos' national economy has been strangled, and the regions controlled by the Vientiane puppet regime have become a new type of U.S. colony.

The memorandum states that the United States continues to maintain semi-military organizations in Laos and continuously sends military personnel and mercenaries. According to recent incomplete statistics, there are nearly five thousand Americans in Laos, of whom three thousand five hundred are military personnel. In addition, there are many military personnel from other countries. Among them, there are about eight hundred Thai military personnel, three hundred military personnel from the South Vietnamese puppet regime, three hundred Japanese military personnel, three hundred Philippine military personnel, and forty-three Indian military doctors and military personnel.

The memorandum states that the United States has also secretly sent many commando units and combat troops from its vassals Thailand and the South Vietnamese puppet regime to operate in northern Laos and the southern regions of Laos bordering South Vietnam.

The memorandum states that the U.S. "aid" organizations and civilian airlines in Laos are actually semi-military organizations. The United States has also turned part of the territory controlled by the Vientiane puppet regime in Laos into military bases backed by Thailand and is using these bases to launch attacks on the Democratic Republic of Vietnam. The United States has established institutions, advisory systems, and a large number of U.S. military personnel in Laos to serve and command the war. The United States also controls the military of the Vientiane puppet regime.

The memorandum points out that the United States has built a series of military equipment, facilities, and strategic transportation networks along the important regions of the Lao-Thai border and along the Mekong River. The United States has already built forty-eight airports and hundreds of helipads in Laos.

The memorandum states that since the United States launched a destructive war against the Democratic Republic of Vietnam with its air force, U.S. jet planes from Thai bases frequently fly over Lao territory to bomb the Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

The memorandum states that the United States is using Thai territory to strengthen its interference in Laos, turning Thailand into a massive logistics base for its war of aggression against Laos. Due to the special geographical relationship between Thailand and Laos, it has become the reliance of the Vientiane puppet regime controlling the regions along the Mekong River.

The memorandum condemns the United States for using its vassal state Japan to lure the Vientiane puppet regime into various political and military alliances and to tighten the military and political collusion between the lackeys of Laos, Thailand, and South Vietnam.

The memorandum states that due to the aggression and interference of U.S. imperialism, Laos' sovereignty, independence, neutrality, unity, and territorial integrity have been trampled upon. The part of Lao territory controlled by the pro-U.S. puppet regime is being turned into a new type of U.S. colony and military base and is being drawn into a new type of alliance within the U.S. sphere of influence. The memorandum points out that this is the blatant and undeniable fact of U.S. imperialism's mad aggression against Laos over the past five years. However, the United States is trying every means to distort the facts. The United Kingdom government, an active ally of the United States, is also deliberately distorting the facts.

The Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front emphasizes that defending the liberation areas is the legitimate and inviolable right of the Lao Patriotic Front and all the people in the liberation areas. The United States and its lackeys have paid a high price for invading the liberation areas, with tens of thousands of pro-U.S. main forces annihilated and hundreds of U.S. bandit planes shot down. This is a great victory for the liberation area forces and a great victory for the Lao people's patriotic struggle against U.S. imperialism.

The memorandum states that this struggle of the Lao people has received the enthusiastic sympathy and support of peace-loving countries and peoples around the world. The Lao people highly value this precious support.

The memorandum states that to solve the Laos issue, it is necessary to stop U.S. interference and aggression.

The memorandum emphasizes that U.S. imperialism will not easily give up its aggressive ambitions. The Lao people should not be complacent about the United States' sinister plots. The Lao people are always prepared to stop any new interference and aggressive actions by U.S. imperialism. The Lao people will not retreat in the face of any test. With the strong support of peace-loving countries and peoples around the world, the Lao people are determined and capable of waging a long-term patriotic struggle against U.S. imperialism to defeat U.S. interference and aggression.

Kanh, Laos, July 22 (Xinhua) - More than 2,000 people from various sectors of Kanh, Laos, held a rally on July 20 to express their determination to carry the just cause of anti-U.S. and national salvation to the end.

At the meeting, Phoumi Vongvichit, Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Lao Patriotic Front, strongly condemned the crimes of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys in destroying the 1962 Geneva Agreement on the Laos issue and various agreements signed by the three sides in Laos. He expressed the determination of the Lao people to carry the struggle against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to the end.

Vongvichit said: Our Lao people have a revolutionary tradition of brave struggle. For a just cause, no matter how great the sacrifice, no matter how fierce and stubborn the enemy, we will never waver in our resolve to fight. To achieve final victory, although we will have to go through many hardships, we are determined to overcome all difficulties and fight to the end. He stressed that we clearly understand that the only way to effectively defend Laos' independence is to resolutely carry out the anti-U.S. patriotic struggle.

Vongvichit pointed out that through long-term arduous struggles, we have developed from a small force into a politically, militarily, and ideologically strong force, and we have achieved many victories.

He said that the enemy's plot to use economic and cultural means to deceive and force the Lao people to surrender has been a complete failure. The plot of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys to annihilate the Lao revolutionary forces has also failed.

He said that the unity among the various patriotic forces in Laos is increasingly developing and consolidating, the Lao National United Front is continuously expanding, and all the Lao people are further recognizing the evil nature of U.S. imperialism and its lackeys.

Vongvichit said that we have thoroughly smashed the enemy's plot of quick victory. We have used the strategy and tactics of people's war to put the enemy in a passive position of being beaten.

Vongvichit said: We have defeated the enemy's so-called "special war." Now the enemy's plot is to bring U.S. troops into Laos to fight. This shows that U.S. imperialism can no longer completely rely on the puppet army of Laos to serve its "special war."

He said that through the struggle, the various patriotic forces in Laos have achieved comprehensive growth and strengthening. The liberation areas, which account for two-thirds of the national territory, have been comprehensively consolidated.

    老挝爱国战线党中央发表备忘录揭露美帝侵略的滔天罪行
    老挝人民决心长期抗战彻底打败美帝侵略
    冯维希说：爱国军民发挥人民战争的战略战术，粉碎了敌人速战速决阴谋
    新华社康开二十三日电　据巴特寮电台广播，老挝爱国战线党中央委员会二十三日发表了一项备忘录，详细揭露了美帝国主义最近五年来侵略老挝的一系列滔天罪行，要求老挝人民对美帝国主义提高警惕，并号召老挝人民坚持长期爱国抗美斗争，彻底打败美帝国主义。
    备忘录指出，美帝国主义是最残暴的侵略者，是最大的战争罪犯，是一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议的破坏者。
    备忘录指出，美帝国主义在老挝的一贯政策是干涉和侵略，是奴役老挝人民，把老挝变成美国的新型殖民地和军事基地。美国使用武力进攻老挝爱国战线党，袭击老挝解放区，推进了反对老挝人民、破坏老挝和平的侵略行动和其他各种战争行动。近几年来，在美帝国主义的指挥下，老挝亲美军队对老挝解放区进行了成千次大规模蚕食进攻和“扫荡”。一九六四年，从美国第七舰队和美国在泰国、越南南方的军事基地起飞的美国喷气式飞机，开始轰炸、扫射老挝解放区。这样，美国就使用空军直接参与了老挝的“特种战争”。一九六四年六月以后，美国扩大了对老挝中、下寮解放区的轰炸规模。仅今年头四个月，美国飞机就出动了一万多架次。从一九六六年初开始，美国又进行了一次战争升级：使用B—52型飞机轰炸老挝解放区，特别是中、下寮地区。美国还使用了凝固汽油弹、磷质弹和珠型炸弹，甚至多次对老挝解放区撒放化学毒药。
    备忘录说，美帝国主义近几年来，扶植万象亲美傀儡政权机构，粗暴干涉老挝内部事务。美国被迫接受一九六二年关于老挝问题的和平解决办法，不得不承认有老挝爱国战线党参加的民族团结政府。但是，一九六三年四月，它就指使其走狗暗杀为维护和平与中立政策而坚决斗争的老挝爱国中立人士、民族团结政府外交大臣贵宁·奔舍那。一九六四年四月，美国又变本加厉地唆使库帕拉西极右军阀集团发动军事政变，推翻民族团结政府，并在万象扶植了一个新的亲美傀儡政权。
    备忘录接着揭露了美国在“援助”的幌子下对老挝进行猖狂的侵略活动。备忘录指出，美国向万象傀儡政权提供“援助”，是根据一系列不平等条约和协定进行的。这些协定保证美国向老挝输出美国货物、购买老挝原料和开发老挝资源等方面有优先权，有决定价格和决定“援助”物资的权利，有控制和使用“援助”的权利以及随时停止“援助”的权利。这些协定还使美国拥有在老挝设立直属美国大使馆的、享有外交特权的军事和经济代表团的权利。这些协定还保证美国有权肆意控制、支配和垄断老挝的政治、军事、经济、财政、银行和商业，并把这个国家变成美国货物的销售市场。很明显，这些协定把老挝完全置于附属于美国的地位。
    备忘录说，据美国和万象傀儡政权机构公布的不完全统计，美国五年来给老挝亲美力量的“援助”共计六亿多美元，其中军事“援助”大约三亿八千多万美元，占百分之六十四强。美国“援助”在万象傀儡政权每年的预算中所占的比例是百分之八十五到百分之九十，在军事预算中占百分之一百。这些数字还不包括美国直接向亲美力量提供的秘密军事“援助”。军事“援助”一贯占美国“援助”的主要部分，说明了美国“援助”的军事性质，暴露了美国对老挝的武力政策和侵略目的。由于美国“援助”的结果，老挝的民族经济受到扼杀，万象傀儡政权控制的地区已经变成美国的新型殖民地。
    备忘录说，美国继续在老挝保持半军事机构，不断向老挝增派军事人员和帮凶军。据最近的不完全统计，目前在老挝的美国人近五千名，其中军事人员增加到三千五百名。此外，还有许多其他国家的军事人员。其中，泰国军事人员约八百名，南越傀儡集团的军事人员约三百名，日本军事人员约三百名，菲律宾军事人员约三百名，以及印度军医军官和军事人员四十三名。
    备忘录说，美国还秘密向老挝派遣其仆从泰国和南越傀儡集团的许多别动队和战斗部队分别在上寮和同南越边界接壤的老挝南部地区活动。
    备忘录说，美国在老挝的“援助”机构和民用航空公司，实际上是一些半军事机构。美国还把万象傀儡政权控制下的老挝一部分领土变成背靠泰国的军事基地，并正在利用这些基地来开展对越南民主共和国的袭击。美国在老挝设有为战争服务和指挥战争的机构、顾问系统和数量庞大的美国军事人员。美国还控制了万象傀儡集团的军队。
    备忘录指出，美国沿着老泰边界地区和沿着湄公河流域的重要地区，建造一系列军事设备、设施和战略交通网。美国已经在老挝建筑了四十八个机场，以及成百个专供直升飞机降落的机坪。
    备忘录说，自从美国用空军对越南民主共和国发动破坏性战争以来，从泰国基地起飞的美国喷气式飞机，经常飞越老挝领土去轰炸越南民主共和国。
    备忘录说，美国正在利用泰国领土来加强干涉老挝，把泰国变成它的侵略老挝战争的一个庞大的后勤基地。由于泰国和老挝在地理位置上的特殊关系，它成了万象傀儡政权控制的沿湄公河流域地区的依靠。
    备忘录谴责美国通过它的仆从国日本，拉拢万象傀儡政权加入各个政治和军事联盟，并加紧策划老挝、泰国和南越走狗之间在军事和政治上的紧密勾结。
    备忘录说，由于美帝国主义的侵略和干涉，老挝的主权、独立、中立、统一和领土完整遭到践踏。由亲美傀儡政权控制的一部分老挝领土，正在变成美国的新型殖民地和军事基地，正在被拉入美国影响范围内的新型联盟。备忘录指出，这就是美帝国主义五年来疯狂地侵略老挝的明摆着的、无法掩盖的事实。但是，美国却千方百计地颠倒黑白，否认这一事实。美国的积极的同盟者——英国政府也蓄意歪曲事实。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会的备忘录强调指出，为保卫解放区而战，是老挝爱国战线党和解放区全体军民的正当的、不可侵犯的权利。美国及其走狗侵犯解放区已经付出了昂贵的代价，成万名亲美主力军被消灭，成百架美国强盗飞机被击落。这是解放区军民的巨大胜利，也是老挝人民的爱国抗美斗争的巨大胜利。
    备忘录说，老挝人民的这场斗争得到了世界上各个爱好和平的国家和人民的热烈同情和支持。老挝人民高度评价这种宝贵的支持。
    备忘录说，要解决老挝问题，就必须停止美国的干涉和侵略。
    备忘录强调说，美帝国主义是不会轻易地放弃它的侵略野心的。老挝人民不应对美国的不可告人的阴谋丧失警惕。老挝人民时刻准备各方面的力量，随时制止美帝国主义新的干涉和侵略行动。老挝人民不会在任何一种考验面前后退。在世界各个爱好和平的国家和人民的大力支持下，老挝人民有决心、有能力进行一场长期的爱国抗美正义斗争，打败美国的干涉和侵略。
    新华社康开二十二日电　老挝康开各界人民两千多人二十日举行集会，表示决心要把抗美救国斗争的正义事业进行到底。
    老挝爱国战线党中央委员会总书记富米·冯维希在会上发表讲话，强烈谴责美帝国主义及其走狗破坏一九六二年关于老挝问题的日内瓦协议和老挝三方面签订的各项协议的罪行，表示老挝人民决心把反对美帝国主义及其走狗的斗争进行到底。
    冯维希说：我们老挝人民具有英勇斗争的革命传统，为了正义的事业，不管要付出多大的牺牲，不管敌人多么凶恶和顽固，也绝对动摇不了我们的斗争意志。为了取得最后胜利，尽管还要经过许多艰难困苦，但是我们有决心克服一切困难，坚决斗争到底。他强调说，我们清楚地认识到：最有效地维护老挝独立的唯一办法就是坚决进行反美爱国斗争。
    冯维希指出：经过长期的艰苦斗争，我们已从一支弱小的力量发展成为一支政治上、军事上、思想上强大的力量，我们取得了许多胜利。
    他说：敌人利用经济、文化进行欺骗，配合武力进攻，企图迫使老挝人民投降的政治阴谋已经遭到彻底失败。美帝国主义及其走狗企图消灭老挝革命力量的阴谋遭到了破产。
    他说：老挝各爱国力量之间的团结日益发展和巩固，老挝民族统一战线不断壮大，全体老挝人民进一步认清了美帝国主义及其走狗的凶恶嘴脸。
    冯维希说，我们已彻底粉碎了敌人的速战速决的阴谋，我们发挥人民战争的战略战术，迫使敌人处于被动挨打的地位。
    冯维希说：我们击败了敌人的所谓“特种战争”。现在敌人的阴谋是企图把美国军队运进老挝作战。这说明美帝国主义再也不能完全依靠老挝的走狗军队为它的“特种战争”效劳了。
    他说：经过斗争，老挝各爱国力量得到了全面的成长和壮大。占全国领土三分之二的解放区得到了全面的巩固。
