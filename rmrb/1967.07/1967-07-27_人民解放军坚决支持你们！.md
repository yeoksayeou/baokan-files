In recent days, our military's broad ranks of officers and soldiers have held massive parades. Yesterday afternoon, various headquarters of the military, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, and the ground, naval, and air forces stationed in Beijing participated in a grand rally at Tiananmen Square. They warmly welcomed Comrades Xie Fuzhi, Wang Li, and others who returned triumphantly and honorably from Wuhan to be by Chairman Mao's side. They resolutely support the proletarian revolutionary masses in Wuhan.

The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military in Wuhan, along with a few bad leaders within the "Million Heroes," have launched a frenzied counterattack against the proletarian revolutionary masses, sparking immense anger among all our military officers and soldiers. These scoundrels' frenzied counterattacks are nothing but desperate struggles. The more evil deeds they commit, the more they expose themselves and hasten their own complete failure. Do they have any real power? No. They only rely on rumors to deceive and mislead some unaware masses. Once the rumors are exposed, they will be ruined. Those who were temporarily deceived by them will definitely fight back.

These few fools are literally lifting stones to drop on their own feet.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Wuhan is advancing towards victory!

The proletarian revolutionary masses in Wuhan are growing stronger with each battle!

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary masses in Wuhan! Your struggle is not isolated. Our great leader Chairman Mao resolutely supports you! Vice Chairman Lin Biao resolutely supports you! The Central Committee resolutely supports you! The Central Military Commission resolutely supports you! The Central Cultural Revolution Group resolutely supports you! All officers and soldiers of our army resolutely support you!

The People's Liberation Army is an army personally created and led by our great leader Chairman Mao, and directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao. All our military officers and soldiers deeply love Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the command of Chairman Mao, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and the proletarian revolutionary masses. To defend Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the command of Chairman Mao, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and to support the proletarian revolutionary masses is our army's most sacred duty and the ironclad oath of our officers and soldiers. Anyone who opposes Chairman Mao, opposes Vice Chairman Lin, opposes the command of Chairman Mao, opposes the Central Cultural Revolution Group, or suppresses the proletarian revolutionary masses is our sworn enemy. No matter how high their position or how long their tenure, we will resolutely overthrow them!

We must arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, heighten our class struggle awareness, heighten our awareness of the struggle between the two lines, heighten our sense of smell, heighten our vigilance, and keep our eyes open. We must not fall for the enemy's tricks. If some comrades have temporarily taken the wrong side, they must immediately turn back once they realize it. Not only must they return to the ranks, but they must also conduct painstaking political and ideological work to educate and win over those who have been deceived, bringing them back to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We call on the deceived masses to rebel! Being deceived is not a crime, but turning back is a merit!

We must resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words! For those who do not listen to Chairman Mao's words and insist on their mistakes, we must resolutely struggle against them and rebel against them! For the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military, we must expose them, overthrow them, smash them, and make them stink so that they never rise again!

The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military will definitely be swept into the dustbin of history by the revolutionary people!

The proletarian revolutionary masses in Wuhan will definitely achieve complete victory!

The proletarian revolutionary masses across the country will definitely achieve complete victory!

    人民解放军坚决支持你们！
    连日以来，我军广大指战员，纷纷举行声势浩大的游行；昨天下午，我军各总部、国防科委、驻京陆海空三军，又参加了天安门广场的隆重集会，最热烈地欢迎谢富治、王力等同志胜利地光荣地从武汉回到了毛主席身边，最坚决地支持武汉地区的无产阶级革命派。
    武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和被他们操纵的“百万雄师”中的一小撮坏头头，对无产阶级革命派的疯狂反扑，激起我全军指战员的无比愤怒。这些家伙的疯狂反扑，不过是垂死挣扎。他们做的坏事越多，就越充分暴露自己，就越加速自己的彻底失败。他们真正有什么力量吗？没有。他们不过是靠谣言欺骗和蒙蔽一些不明真相的群众。谣言戳穿了，他们也就破产了。被他们一时蒙蔽的群众，就一定会大杀回马枪。
    这一小撮蠢人，正是自己搬起石头来砸自己的脚。
    武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命正在胜利前进！
    武汉地区的无产阶级革命派正越战越强！
    武汉地区的无产阶级革命派战友们！你们的斗争决不是孤立的。我们的伟大领袖毛主席坚决支持你们！我们的林彪副主席坚决支持你们！党中央坚决支持你们！中央军委坚决支持你们！中央文革坚决支持你们！我全军指战员坚决支持你们！
    我们人民解放军是伟大领袖毛主席亲自缔造和领导的、林彪副主席直接指挥的人民军队。我们全军广大指战员都无限热爱毛主席，热爱林副主席，热爱毛主席的司令部，热爱中央文革，热爱无产阶级革命派。保卫毛主席，保卫林副主席，保卫毛主席的司令部，保卫中央文革，支持无产阶级革命派，是我军最神圣的职责，是我军指战员从内心发出的钢铁誓言。谁反对毛主席，谁反对林副主席，谁反对毛主席的司令部，谁反对中央文革，谁镇压无产阶级革命派，谁就是我们的不共戴天的死敌。不管他地位多高，资格多老，我们都要坚决把他打倒！
    我们一定要用毛泽东思想武装起来，提高阶级斗争观念，提高两条路线斗争的观念，提高嗅觉，提高警惕，擦亮眼睛，千万不要上敌人的当。有的同志如果一时站错了队，发现之后，就要毫不犹豫地立即回头。不仅自己要归队，并且还要进行艰苦细致的政治思想工作，教育争取那些受蒙蔽的群众，一起回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。我们号召受蒙蔽的群众起来造反！受蒙蔽无罪，反戈一击有功！
    我们要坚决听毛主席的话！对于那些不听毛主席的话，坚持错误的人，要坚决和他作斗争，造他的反！对于党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，我们要把他揪出来，斗倒斗垮斗臭，让他永世不得翻身！
    党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，一定会被革命人民扫到历史垃圾堆里去！
    武汉地区的无产阶级革命派一定能够取得彻底胜利！
    全国各地的无产阶级革命派一定能够取得彻底胜利！
                                        （七月二十六日）
