Thunder in India

A clap of thunder, a spring thunder, is shaking the land of India. The revolutionary peasants of India's Darjeeling region have risen up in rebellion. Under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Indian Communist Party, a red region of rural revolutionary armed struggle has been born in India! This is a major development in the revolutionary struggle of the Indian people.

Over the past few months, the peasant masses of the Darjeeling region, under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Indian Communist Party, have shattered the shackles of modern revisionism, broken through all the nets that bound them, and seized grain, land, and guns from the landlords and plantation owners. They have punished the local tyrants and evil gentry, ambushed the reactionary military and police forces conducting "mopping-up" operations, and demonstrated the immense power of peasant armed struggle. Imperialism, revisionism, corrupt officials, local tyrants and evil gentry, reactionary armies and police—none of these are in the eyes of the revolutionary peasants, and all of them will be kicked over and thrown to the ground. The revolutionary faction of the Indian Communist Party is right, and they have done well! The Chinese people enthusiastically cheer for the revolutionary storm of the peasants in India's Darjeeling region! All Marxist-Leninists and revolutionary people around the world enthusiastically cheer for the revolutionary storm of the peasants in India's Darjeeling region!

The Indian peasants have risen up in rebellion, and the Indian people have risen up in revolution. This is inevitable and is the result of the reactionary rule of the Indian National Congress. Under the rule of the Indian National Congress, India may have formally gained independence, but it remains a semi-colonial, semi-feudal society. The Indian National Congress government represents the interests of the feudal princes, large landlords, and bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie. It ruthlessly oppresses and exploits the Indian people, and externally, in addition to continuing to depend on the original colonial power, British imperialism, it has also aligned itself with the new master, American imperialism, and its chief accomplice, the Soviet revisionist clique, doing its utmost to sell out the country. Thus, imperialism, Soviet revisionism, feudalism, and bureaucratic comprador capitalism—these four mountains weigh heavily on the broad masses of the Indian people, especially the working people and peasants. In recent years, the Indian National Congress government has intensified its oppression and exploitation of the Indian people, implementing a policy of selling out the country, resulting in continuous famines and widespread starvation. The broad masses of the Indian people, especially the peasants, can no longer endure it. Now, the revolutionary peasants of the Darjeeling region have finally risen up in rebellion and are conducting a violent revolution. This is the prelude to the violent revolution of hundreds of millions of people across India. The Indian people will definitely overthrow these four mountains and achieve a complete liberation. This is the historical trend of India, which is unstoppable and irresistible.

The question of which road the Indian revolution should take is a fundamental issue that determines the success or failure of the Indian revolution and the fate of five hundred million Indian people. The Indian revolution must take the road of relying on the peasants, establishing rural base areas, persisting in protracted armed struggle, and using the countryside to encircle the cities, ultimately seizing the cities. This is the road taken by Mao Zedong, the road of victory in the Chinese revolution, and the inevitable path to victory for all oppressed peoples and nations.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out as early as forty years ago: "Tens of millions of peasants from the central, southern, and northern provinces of China will rise up. Their momentum will be like a sudden storm, swift and fierce. No matter what great force tries to suppress them, they will break through all the nets that bind them and rush forward on the road to liberation. All imperialists, warlords, corrupt officials, local tyrants, and evil gentry will be buried in their graves."

Chairman Mao has long clearly pointed out the extremely important position of the peasant question in the people's revolution. Peasants are the main force in the national democratic revolution against imperialism and its running dogs and the most reliable and broadest allies of the proletariat. India is a semi-colonial, semi-feudal country with a population of five hundred million, and peasants make up the vast majority of the population. Once hundreds of millions of Indian peasants are mobilized, they will form an invincible powerful force for the Indian revolution. The proletariat of India, combined with hundreds of millions of peasants, can bring about a tremendous upheaval in the vast rural areas of India and, through a heart-rending people's war, defeat any powerful enemy.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches: "The central task and highest form of revolution is the armed seizure of power, solving problems through war. This Marxist-Leninist revolutionary principle is universally correct, whether in China or abroad."

The characteristics of the Indian revolution are the same as those of the Chinese revolution: armed revolution against armed counter-revolution. The road of armed struggle is the only correct road for the Indian revolution; there is no other road. What "Gandhism" and the "parliamentary road" are, are nothing but opium for the Indian people, used by the Indian ruling class to sedate them. Only through violent revolution and the road of armed struggle can India be saved, and the complete liberation of the Indian people be achieved. Specifically, it means to mobilize the peasant masses, establish and strengthen revolutionary armed forces, and use the flexible strategies and tactics of people's war personally formulated by Chairman Mao to deal with the temporary superiority of imperialism and the reactionaries' armed suppression, persist in protracted armed struggle, and step by step achieve revolutionary victory.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, based on the characteristics of the Chinese revolution, pointed out the importance of establishing rural revolutionary base areas. Chairman Mao teaches: "To persist in protracted armed struggle and defeat imperialism and its running dogs, 'it is necessary to turn the backward countryside into advanced and consolidated base areas, into great revolutionary fortresses in the military, political, economic, and cultural spheres, with which to counter the vicious enemy who uses the cities to attack the rural areas, and with which to achieve, step by step, complete victory in the long struggle.'"

India is vast, and the vast rural areas are the weak link in the reactionary rule. There, there is a vast arena for revolutionaries to roam freely. As long as the revolutionary faction of the Indian proletariat adheres to the Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought revolutionary line, relies on the great ally of the peasants, it is entirely possible to create one advanced rural revolutionary base area after another in the vast backward rural areas of India and build a new type of people's army. Such revolutionary base areas, no matter how many difficulties and twists and turns they encounter, will eventually develop from point to surface and from small patches to large patches in a wave-like manner. In this way, the Indian revolution can gradually form a situation of encircling the cities from the countryside, paving the way for the final seizure of the cities and the achievement of national victory.

The development of armed struggle in the Darjeeling countryside has already made the Indian reactionaries panic-stricken, feeling that disaster is imminent. They cry out that the peasant uprising in Darjeeling "will turn into a national disaster." Imperialism and the Indian reactionaries are doing everything they can to suppress the armed struggle of the Darjeeling peasants, trying to strangle it in its cradle. The Danji traitor clique and a handful of Indian Communist Party revisionist leaders are also busily slandering and attacking the great deeds of the revolutionary faction of the Indian Communist Party and the revolutionary peasants of Darjeeling. The so-called "non-Congress government" of West Bengal is also openly collaborating with the Indian reactionaries to carry out bloody suppression against the revolutionary peasants of Darjeeling. This only further proves that these traitors and revisionists are the running dogs of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism, the slaves of the Indian big landlords and big bourgeoisie, and the so-called "non-Congress government" is merely a tool of the Indian big landlords and big bourgeoisie.

However, no matter how imperialism, the Indian reactionaries, and modern revisionism combine forces to carry out sabotage and suppression, the torch of armed struggle lit by the revolutionary faction of the Indian Communist Party and the revolutionary peasants of Darjeeling cannot be extinguished. "A single spark can start a prairie fire." The spark in Darjeeling will definitely spread and will definitely spread. A great storm of revolutionary armed struggle that sweeps across all of India will definitely come, and it will definitely come! Although the road of the Indian revolution is long and tortuous, the Indian revolution, under the guidance of the great Marxist-Leninist and Mao Zedong Thought, will definitely achieve final victory.

　　印度的春雷
    霹雳一声春雷，震撼着印度的大地。印度大吉岭地区的革命农民，起来造反了。在印度共产党革命派的领导下，一块农村革命武装斗争的红色地区在印度诞生了！这是印度人民革命斗争的一个重大的发展。
    几个月来，大吉岭地区的农民群众，在印度共产党革命派的领导下，打碎现代修正主义的枷锁，冲决了一切束缚他们的罗网，向地主和种植园主夺粮、夺地、夺枪，惩治土豪劣绅，伏击“进剿”的反动军警，显示了农民革命武装斗争的巨大威力。什么帝国主义，什么修正主义，什么贪官污吏、土豪劣绅，什么反动军队和警察，统统都不在革命农民的眼里，统统要把它们踢翻，打倒在地。印共革命派做得对，做得好！中国人民为印度大吉岭地区的农民的革命风暴而热烈欢呼！全世界的马克思列宁主义者和革命的人民，都为印度大吉岭地区农民的革命风暴而热烈欢呼！
    印度农民起来造反，印度人民起来革命，是势所必然的，是印度国大党的反动统治逼出来的。国大党统治下的印度，形式上虽然获得了独立，但是，它仍然是一个半殖民地、半封建的社会。国大党政府所代表的是印度封建王公、大地主和官僚买办资产阶级的利益，它对内残酷地压迫和敲骨吸髓地剥削印度人民，对外除了继续依附于原来的宗主国英帝国主义之外，又投靠新的主子美帝国主义及其头号帮凶苏修集团，竭尽卖国之能事。这样，帝国主义、苏联修正主义、封建主义、官僚买办资本主义这几座大山沉重地压在印度广大人民，尤其是工农劳苦大众的头上。近几年来，国大党政府变本加厉地镇压和剥削印度人民，推行卖国政策，使得印度连年饥荒，饿殍遍野，印度的广大人民再也活不下去了，特别是印度广大的农民再也活不下去了。现在，大吉岭地区革命农民终于起来造反，起来进行暴力革命。这是印度全国亿万人民起来进行暴力革命的先声。印度人民一定会推倒这几座大山，彻底翻身。这是印度历史的总趋向，是不可抑止，不可阻挡的。
    印度革命应该走什么道路，这是关系到印度革命成败的根本问题，是关系到五亿印度人民命运的根本问题。印度革命必须走依靠农民，建立农村根据地，坚持长期的武装斗争，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市的道路。这是毛泽东的道路，是中国革命所走过的胜利的道路，是一切被压迫人民和被压迫民族的革命胜利的必由之路。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席远在四十年前就指出：“几万万农民从中国中部、南部和北部各省起来，其势如暴风骤雨，迅猛异常，无论什么大的力量都将压抑不住。他们将冲决一切束缚他们的罗网，朝着解放的路上迅跑。一切帝国主义、军阀、贪官污吏、土豪劣绅，都将被他们葬入坟墓。”
    毛主席早就明确地指出了农民问题在人民革命中占有极端重要的地位。农民是反对帝国主义及其走狗的民族民主革命的主力军，是无产阶级最可靠最广大的同盟者。印度是一个五亿人口的半殖民地、半封建的大国，农民又占全国人口的绝大多数。一旦几亿印度农民被发动起来，就会形成印度革命的不可战胜的强大力量。印度的无产阶级同几亿农民结合起来，就能够在印度广大的农村出现一个翻天覆地的大变动，就能够通过一场惊心动魄的人民战争，去战胜任何强大的敌人。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。这个马克思列宁主义的革命原则是普遍地对的，不论在中国在外国，一概都是对的。”
    印度革命的特点，同中国革命的特点一样，是武装的革命反对武装的反革命。武装斗争的道路，是印度革命唯一正确的道路，舍此没有任何其它的道路。什么“甘地主义”，什么“议会道路”，统统都是印度统治阶级麻醉印度人民的鸦片烟。只有依靠暴力革命，走武装斗争的道路，才能拯救印度，才能取得印度人民的彻底解放。具体地说，就是要放手发动农民群众，建立和壮大革命的武装力量，用毛主席所亲手制订的一整套人民战争机动灵活的战略战术，去对付暂时比革命力量强大的帝国主义和反动派的武装镇压，坚持长期的武装斗争，一步一步地去夺取革命的胜利。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席根据中国革命的特点，指出了建立农村革命根据地的重要性。毛主席教导说：为了坚持长期的武装斗争，战胜帝国主义及其走狗，“必须把落后的农村造成先进的巩固的根据地，造成军事上、政治上、经济上、文化上的伟大的革命阵地，借以反对利用城市进攻农村区域的凶恶敌人，借以在长期战斗中逐步地争取革命的全部胜利。”
    印度幅员辽阔，广大农村是反动统治的薄弱环节，那里有着革命者纵横驰骋的广阔天地。只要印度的无产阶级革命派，坚持马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的革命路线，依靠农民这支伟大的同盟军，完全有条件在印度广大的落后的农村创建一个又一个先进的农村革命根据地，建设起一支新型的人民军队。这样的革命根据地，不管遇到多大的困难和曲折，终将由点到面、由小片到大片地波浪式地发展起来。这样，印度的革命就能够逐步地形成农村包围城市的局面，为最后夺取城市，取得全国的胜利开辟道路。
    大吉岭农村武装斗争的发展，已经使得印度反动派惊慌失措，感到大难临头了。他们惊呼，大吉岭的农民暴动“将会变成全国性的灾难”。帝国主义和印度反动派正在千方百计地把大吉岭农民的武装斗争镇压下去，力图把它扼杀在摇篮里。丹吉叛徒集团和一小撮印共修正主义头目们，都在起劲地诽谤和攻击印共革命派和大吉岭革命农民的伟大的壮举。西孟加拉邦的所谓“非国大党政府”，也公然同印度反动派一起，对大吉岭的革命农民实行血腥镇压。这只能进一步证明，这伙叛徒和修正主义者，都是美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的走狗，是印度大地主、大资产阶级的奴仆，所谓“非国大党政府”，不过是印度大地主、大资产阶级的工具。
    但是，不管帝国主义、印度反动派和现代修正主义如何配合起来，进行破坏和镇压，印共革命派和大吉岭革命农民所点燃起来的武装斗争的火炬是熄灭不了的。“星星之火，可以燎原。”大吉岭的星星之火，终将燎原，一定要燎原。一场席卷全印度的革命武装斗争的伟大风暴，终将到来，一定要到来！尽管印度革命斗争的道路是长期的、曲折的，但是印度的革命，在伟大的马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的指引下，必将取得最后的胜利。
