The British imperialist fascist authorities brazenly sent British troops into Hong Kong's urban areas last night, collaborating with Hong Kong police to suppress Hong Kong compatriots. This is the first time since the British authorities' mad persecution of our compatriots in May this year that regular British troops have been deployed to suppress Chinese compatriots, and the nature of this action is extremely serious. Hong Kong compatriots are closely watching the developments.

Last night at around 10:40 PM, a batch of regular British troops from the "Welsh Regiment" and part of the auxiliary troops "Hong Kong Regiment" moved from the suburbs into the urban areas. When they passed through the Sau Mau Ping area in military vehicles, they fired shots at the Wah Do National Goods Company and the Guangdong Provincial Bank's Sau Mau Ping branch, provoking our compatriots. Around 11:00 PM, part of the British troops set up positions near the Wah Fung National Goods Company in North Point, erected barbed wire on several streets, and fixed bayonets on their rifles. At the same time, another part of the British troops set up positions in the Wan Chai district along Canal Road, Stubbs Road, and Lockhart Road, erecting barbed wire. They, along with the "riot police" that had already been deployed in the above two areas, conducted joint patrols. After 11:00 PM, the British troops and Hong Kong police in the Wan Chai area jointly surrounded the Hong Kong and Kowloon Motorcycle Industry Workers' Union, forcibly entering the union to conduct searches, loot, and arbitrarily arrest our compatriots. Shortly after, the British troops and police in North Point jointly surrounded the Hong Kong Public Transport Company branch of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Motorcycle Industry Workers' Union on Chai Wah Street, conducting searches and arrests. It was not until early this morning that the British troops withdrew from Hong Kong's urban areas.

In the Kowloon area, last night a batch of British troops also patrolled many streets in the urban areas in military vehicles. In recent days, the British authorities have continuously deployed "riot police" in various districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon to madly suppress compatriots. Compatriots, for self-defense, took to the streets in large numbers to fight back and punish them, making the "riot police" suffer heavy losses and retreat in disarray. Now, the British imperialists, in a desperate move, have brazenly deployed regular British troops to deal with our unarmed compatriots. Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots solemnly warn the British authorities: due to your deployment of British troops to suppress our compatriots, your fascist atrocities have escalated to a more serious level. Our anti-violence actions will also be escalated. If you dare to use British troops to slaughter our compatriots, you will definitely face our more severe punishment.

    英帝悍然出动陆军镇压香港同胞
    我爱国同胞严正警告港英当局：你们胆敢使用英军来屠杀我爱国同胞，一定要受到更严厉的惩罚。
    新华社香港十三日电　港英法西斯当局昨晚悍然把英国陆军开入香港市区，同港英警察一起镇压香港爱国同胞。这是今年五月港英疯狂迫害我爱国同胞以来，首次出动正规英军镇压中国同胞，性质十分严重，香港爱国同胞正密切注视中。
    昨天晚上十时四十分左右，一批属于“威尔斯兵团”的正规英国陆军和一部分辅助陆军“香港团队”，从香港郊区开进市区。当他们乘坐军车经过筲箕湾地区时，曾向华都国货公司和广东省银行筲箕湾分行施放冷枪，对我爱国同胞进行挑衅。十一时左右，一部分英军在北角华丰国货公司附近布防，在几条街道上架起铁丝网，枪枝上了刺刀。同时，另一部分英军在湾仔区轩尼诗道、史钊域道和骆克道一带布防，架设铁丝网。他们和早已布防在上述两地区的“防暴队”一起，联合巡逻。十一时过后，布防在湾仔地区的英军和港英警察联合包围了港九摩托车业职工总会，并强行攻入工会内进行搜查、劫掠和横蛮拘捕我爱国同胞，稍后，布防在北角的英军和警察，又联合包围了港九摩托车业职工总会设在渣华街的香港公共汽车分会，并强行搜查和拘捕爱国同胞。直到今日凌晨，英军才从香港市区撤走。
    在九龙地区，昨夜也有一批英军乘坐军车在市区许多街道上巡逻。最近几天来，港英连续出动“防暴队”在港九各地区疯狂镇压爱国同胞。同胞们为了自卫，纷纷走上街头，予以还击，给予惩罚，把“防暴队”打得焦头烂额，狼狈不堪。现在，英帝国主义狗急跳墙，悍然出动正规英军，对付赤手空拳的我爱国同胞。港九爱国同胞们严正警告港英当局：由于你们出动英军镇压我爱国同胞，你们的法西斯暴行升了严重的一级，我们的抗暴行动也要升级，你们胆敢使用英军来屠杀我爱国同胞，你们就一定要受到我们更严厉的惩罚。
