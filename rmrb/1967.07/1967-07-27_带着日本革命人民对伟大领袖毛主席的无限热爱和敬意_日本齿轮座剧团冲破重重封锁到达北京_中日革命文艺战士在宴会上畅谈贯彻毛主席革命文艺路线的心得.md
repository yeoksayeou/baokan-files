With the unlimited love and respect of the Japanese revolutionary people for the great leader Chairman Mao, the Japanese Gear Theater Troupe, breaking through the numerous blockades imposed by the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and the Japanese Communist Party revisionists, arrived in Beijing, the source of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution that has shaken the world, on an airplane last night. They were warmly welcomed by the revolutionary artists of the capital.

In the spacious and bright waiting room of the airport, revolutionary artists of the capital held a welcoming ceremony. Tsumugi Fujikawa, the leader of the Gear Theater Troupe, said excitedly at the welcoming ceremony, "We sincerely wish the great leader of all the people of the world, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, eternal life! We bring the fervent respect of the Japanese people for the great leader Chairman Mao to China. She said, the Japanese people, inspired by the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, have resolutely risen up to fight against U.S. imperialism, the Japanese reactionaries, and the Japanese Communist Party revisionists. The Japanese Gear Theater has been reborn in this new situation. We firmly believe in Chairman Mao's teachings and will follow Chairman Mao's teachings to serve the anti-U.S. struggle of the Japanese people.

Chu Tu-nan, the president of the China-Japan Friendship Association, who came to welcome the Japanese friends, said in his speech at the welcoming ceremony, "The comrades of the Gear Theater have unlimited love and faith in Mao Zedong Thought. You study and apply Mao Zedong Thought, using Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as weapons, bravely fighting against the U.S.-Japan reactionaries and creating a great atmosphere of anti-revisionism. You are not afraid of violence and show the great spirit of revolutionaries. You are the hope of the Japanese people. Victory will surely belong to the Japanese people, and those U.S.-Japan reactionaries and a handful of Japanese Communist Party revisionists will surely be thrown into the dustbin of history."

Last night at 11:30, the airplane carrying the Japanese friends landed to the enthusiastic shouts and drumbeats. Tsumugi Fujikawa, the leader of the troupe, Yoshihisa Nikko, the deputy leader, and all the members of the troupe waved the radiant "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and held up red banners with the words "Long Live Mao Zedong Thought!" as they stepped off the plane. Chu Tu-nan and relevant officials warmly shook hands with the Japanese friends, welcoming them to visit and perform in China amidst the triumphant songs of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Japanese revolutionary friends working in Beijing also came to welcome the Gear Theater, holding up portraits of Chairman Mao and banners. Together with Chinese revolutionary artists, they waved the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and paid tribute to the Japanese revolutionary artists. The revolutionary artists of both countries together studied Chairman Mao's teachings:

"All the people of the world, unite and defeat the U.S. aggressors and all their lackeys! All the people of the world, be courageous and dare to fight, do not fear difficulties, and press on. Then, the whole world will surely belong to the people. All ghosts and monsters will be destroyed."

At the airplane, representatives of the revolutionary artists of the capital presented the Japanese friends with the precious book of the revolutionary people of the world, the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," and pinned golden Mao badges on the chests of the Japanese comrades. The Japanese revolutionary artists, with tears of excitement, shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

As the welcoming ceremony concluded, the revolutionary artists of both countries enthusiastically shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" and sang "The East Is Red" over and over again.

New China News Agency, July 26th: Tsumugi Fujikawa, the leader of the Japanese Gear Theater Troupe, said today that the comrades of the Gear Theater are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and follow the revolutionary direction indicated by Chairman Mao's "Talks at the Yan'an Forum on Literature and Art" for the rest of their lives.

At the banquet filled with deep proletarian internationalist sentiments, Tsumugi Fujikawa enthusiastically said these words. This banquet was held by the China-Japan Friendship Association to welcome the Gear Theater Troupe's visit to China.

The comrades of the Gear Theater, each holding a radiant "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and wearing Mao badges on their chests, exchanged experiences in studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle and shared their insights on implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on the arts at the banquet.

Chu Tu-nan, the president of the China-Japan Friendship Association, spoke first at the banquet, enthusiastically praising the revolutionary fighting spirit of the comrades of the Gear Theater. He said, Chairman Mao teaches us, "The Japanese nation is a great nation. It will never allow U.S. imperialism to ride roughshod over it for long." The true Marxist-Leninists, the true proletarian revolutionaries of Japan, are the pillars of the Japanese people's revolution. The Gear Theater Troupe, holding high the revolutionary banner and using art as a weapon of struggle, has made great contributions in the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle and in strengthening the friendship and unity between the peoples of China and Japan.

Chu Tu-nan said, speaking of the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, the revolutionary artists of China, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line on the arts, have overturned the history that has been overturned by the exploiting classes, making art a powerful weapon to "unite the people, educate the people, attack the enemy, and annihilate the enemy," creating a new era in the history of proletarian arts.

Tsumugi Fujikawa said in her speech, "Now, the place where we stand firmly with both feet is the base of the worldwide revolutionary people's anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle, the capital of China, Beijing. We are able to visit the place where our beloved Chairman Mao resides, and we feel extremely happy."

She said, Mao Zedong Thought is the peak of Marxism-Leninism in the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is achieving victory worldwide. We are determined, through this visit to China, to deeply study the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution of China and to master the active application of the great Mao Zedong Thought.

Tsumugi Fujikawa reviewed the tortuous road that the Gear Theater has traveled over the past fifteen years. She said, under the inspiration of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, we have begun to deeply study Mao Zedong Thought in the process of engaging in the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle in Japan. Chairman Mao teaches us, "Our literary and art workers must complete this task and must shift their stand. They must shift to one side, to the side of the workers, peasants, and soldiers, to the side of the proletariat. Only in this way can we have genuine literature and art for the workers, peasants, and soldiers, genuine proletarian literature and art." The Gear Theater, following Chairman Mao's teachings, has gone deep into the countryside and mines, learning from the poor peasants and miners, gradually shifting our stand to the side of the workers and peasants. She said, we have just taken the first step in self-reform. We pledge that under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we will walk this path for the rest of our lives.

Koji Nishizono, a Japanese friend in Beijing, also spoke at the banquet. He expressed his hope that the comrades of the Gear Theater would study Mao Zedong Thought better in China and make greater contributions to promoting the revolutionary struggle in Japan.

The boundless Mao Zedong Thought has tightly woven the feelings of the revolutionary artists of both countries together. As the banquet concluded, the revolutionary artists of both countries exchanged Mao badges and encouraged each other to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the struggle.

    在机场宽阔明亮的候机室里，首都革命文艺工作者举行了欢迎仪式。齿轮座剧团团长藤川夏子在欢迎会上激动地说，我们衷心祝全世界人民的伟大领袖、我们心中的红太阳毛主席万寿无疆！我们带着日本人民对伟大领袖毛主席火热般的敬意来到中国。她说，日本人民在史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命鼓舞下，毅然决然地起来同美帝国主义、日本反动派和日共修正主义分子进行坚决的斗争。日本齿轮座在这样的新形势下再生了。我们坚信毛主席的教导，要遵照毛主席的教导为日本人民的反美斗争服务。
    前来欢迎日本朋友的对外友协会长楚图南在欢迎仪式上致词说，齿轮座的同志们对毛泽东思想无限热爱，无限信仰，你们活学活用毛泽东思想，以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为武器，勇敢地和美日反动派作斗争，大造日共一小撮修正主义分子的反。你们不畏强暴，表现出革命派的伟大气概，你们是日本人民的希望。胜利一定属于日本人民，而那些美日反动派和日共一小撮修正主义分子一定会被丢进历史的垃圾堆。
    昨晚十一时半，日本朋友们乘坐的飞机在热烈的口号声和锣鼓声中降落，藤川夏子团长、日笠世志久副团长和剧团全体同志挥动着红光闪耀的《毛主席语录》，高举着红色横幅标语“毛泽东思想万岁！”走下飞机。楚图南和有关方面负责人同日本朋友热烈握手，欢迎他们在我国无产阶级文化大革命节节胜利的凯歌声中来我国访问演出。在北京工作的日本革命朋友，高举着毛主席像和标语牌也来欢迎齿轮座，他们和中国革命文艺工作者一起挥动《毛主席语录》，向日本的革命文艺战士致敬。中日两国革命文艺工作者一起学习了毛主席的教导：
  “全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！全世界人民要有勇气，敢于战斗，不怕困难，前赴后继，那末，全世界就一定是人民的。一切魔鬼通通都会被消灭。”
    在飞机旁，首都文艺界无产阶级革命派代表向日本朋友赠送了世界革命人民的宝书《毛主席语录》，并且把金光闪闪的毛主席像章别在日本战友的胸前。日本革命文艺战士含着激动的泪水高呼：“毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    欢迎会结束时，中日两国革命文艺工作者尽情高呼：“毛主席万岁！”一遍遍高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
    新华社二十六日讯  日本齿轮座剧团团长藤川夏子今天说，齿轮座的同志们决心高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，按照毛主席《在延安文艺座谈会上的讲话》所指引的革命方向走下去，一辈子走这条道路。
    在洋溢着无产阶级国际主义深情厚谊的宴会上，藤川夏子热情地讲了这些话。这次宴会是对外友协为欢迎齿轮座剧团来我国访问举行的。
    齿轮座的同志们，今天人人手捧着红光闪闪的《毛主席语录》，胸前佩戴着毛主席像章。在宴会上，中日两国革命文艺工作者畅谈在反帝反修斗争中活学活用毛主席著作的体会，交流贯彻执行毛主席革命文艺路线的心得。
    对外友协会长楚图南在宴会上首先讲话，热烈赞扬齿轮座同志们的革命战斗精神。他说，毛主席教导我们：“日本民族是一个伟大的民族。它是绝不会让美帝国主义长期骑在自己头上的。”日本真正的马克思列宁主义者，真正的无产阶级革命战士，是日本人民革命的中流砥柱。齿轮座剧团高举革命大旗，以文艺作为斗争的武器，在反帝反修和加强中日两国人民友好团结方面，作出了很大贡献。
    楚图南谈到由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利时说，中国革命的文艺工作者，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决执行毛主席的革命文艺路线，把被剥削阶级颠倒了的历史重新颠倒过来，使文艺成为“团结人民、教育人民、打击敌人、消灭敌人的有力的武器”，开创了无产阶级文艺史上的新纪元。
    藤川夏子在讲话中说，现在我们两脚坚定站立的地方，是全世界革命人民反帝反修斗争的根据地、中国的首都北京，我们能够访问敬爱的毛主席所居住的地方，感到无比的高兴。
    她说，毛泽东思想是帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义在全世界取得胜利时代的马列主义的最高峰。我们决心通过这次访华演出，深入学习中国无产阶级文化大革命，掌握对伟大的毛泽东思想的活学活用。
    藤川夏子回顾了齿轮座十五年来所走过的曲折道路，她说，我们在中国无产阶级文化大革命的鼓舞下，在投身于日本的反帝反修斗争过程中，开始深入地学习毛泽东思想。毛主席教导我们：“我们的文艺工作者一定要完成这个任务，一定要把立足点移过来，一定要在深入工农兵群众、深入实际斗争的过程中，在学习马克思主义和学习社会的过程中，逐渐地移过来，移到工农兵这方面来，移到无产阶级这方面来。只有这样，我们才能有真正为工农兵的文艺，真正无产阶级的文艺。”齿轮座根据毛主席的教导深入农村、矿山，向贫农学习，向矿工学习，逐渐把我们的立足点移到工农方面来。她说，我们刚刚迈开自我改造的第一步，我们宣誓，在毛泽东思想的指引下，我们一辈子走这条路。
    在北京的日本朋友西园寺公一也在宴会上讲了话。他表示期望齿轮座的同志们在中国更好地学习毛泽东思想，为进一步推动日本的革命斗争作出贡献。
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想，使中日两国革命文艺工作者的感情紧紧交融在一起。宴会结束时，两国革命文艺战士互赠毛主席像章，互相勉励要更好地在斗争中活学活用毛主席著作。
