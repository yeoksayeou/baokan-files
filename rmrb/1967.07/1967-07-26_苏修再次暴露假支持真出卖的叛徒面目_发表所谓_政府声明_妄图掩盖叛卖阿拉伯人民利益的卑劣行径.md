The Soviet revisionists have once again exposed their traitorous face of fake support and true betrayal by issuing a so-called "government statement" in an attempt to cover up their despicable act of betraying the interests of the Arab people.

The Soviet revisionists and American imperialists colluded in the United Nations General Assembly's "emergency discussion" on the Middle East issue, which has just concluded. On July 22, the Soviet revisionist leadership issued a "government statement," trying every means to cover up their exposed ugly face of fake support and true betrayal of the Arab people in this farce.

In the "statement," the Soviet revisionist clique dressed themselves up as "defenders" of the interests of the Arab people, pretending that the United States and its lackeys "obstructed" the United Nations General Assembly from "passing effective resolutions" on eliminating the consequences of Israeli aggression and withdrawing Israeli troops from occupied territories. They also talked about how "all peace-loving countries should continue to make efforts," etc. This is nothing but a trick of the thief crying "catch the thief." The facts are clear: the Soviet revisionist clique proposed this emergency session of the General Assembly not to "defend" the legitimate rights of the Arab people, but to create an excuse for Soviet leader Kosygin to go to the United States to engage in counter-revolutionary global collusion with American imperialist leader Johnson, further betraying the interests of the Arab people. It is precisely because of the collusion between American imperialism and Soviet revisionism that the emergency session of the General Assembly, despite dragging on for more than a month, ended in nothing, with no resolutions passed to condemn the American-Israeli aggressors, nor any resolutions demanding that Israeli troops withdraw from the Arab lands they have occupied.

In the "statement," the Soviet revisionists feigned importance, shouting that "the Security Council now has a heavy responsibility," claiming that they "will, as always, be prepared to cooperate with all peace-loving countries" to "constructively solve" the Middle East problem, especially the issue of Israeli withdrawal. In reality, the Security Council, like the United Nations General Assembly, is a place where American imperialism and Soviet revisionism practice hegemony politics and carry out counter-revolutionary deals. They deliberately kick the ball back and forth, first from the Security Council to the General Assembly, then from the General Assembly back to the Security Council, all for the purpose of deceiving the Arab people and the people of the world, and inducing the Arab people to make concessions.

The Soviet revisionist clique once again played a cunning two-faced game in the "statement," declaring that they will continue to provide "political support" to Arab countries in their struggle for legitimate rights, help them restore and develop their economies, and strengthen their defenses, etc., attempting to continue their sugar-coated bullet attacks on Arab countries and peoples.

However, no matter what tricks the Soviet revisionists play, they can never cover up their despicable acts of actively serving as the number one accomplice of American imperialism and betraying the interests of the Arab people. The Arab people have already seen through the true face of the Soviet revisionist traitor clique and have suffered enough from the Soviet revisionists. They are increasingly realizing that only by relying on their own strength and conducting unyielding struggles can they defend their national independence and frustrate the aggression of American imperialism and its running dog Israel. The Arab people will surely smash all the conspiracies and tricks of American imperialism and Soviet revisionism.

    苏修再次暴露假支持真出卖的叛徒面目
    发表所谓“政府声明”妄图掩盖叛卖阿拉伯人民利益的卑劣行径
    新华社二十五日讯  苏修和美帝串通一气，在联合国大会演出的“紧急讨论”中东问题的丑剧刚刚收场，苏修领导集团便在二十二日发表“政府声明”，千方百计地掩饰他们在这场丑剧中暴露的继续对阿拉伯人民假支持、真出卖的丑恶面目。
    苏修集团在“声明”中竟把自己打扮成阿拉伯人民利益的“维护者”，装模作样地说美国及其仆从“妨碍”联合国大会“通过关于消除以色列侵略的后果、关于以色列军队撤出侵占地区的有效决议”，并且大谈什么“所有爱好和平的国家应当继续努力”等等。这完全是贼喊捉贼的伎俩。事实已很清楚，苏修集团所以提议召开这次联大紧急会议，绝不是要“维护”阿拉伯人民的正当权益，而是为了制造一个借口，使苏修头目柯西金前往美国，去同美帝头目约翰逊进行反革命的全球大勾结，进一步出卖阿拉伯人民的利益。正是由于美帝苏修的合谋，联大紧急会议尽管断断续续开了一个多月，但结果不了了之，既没有通过任何决议谴责美以侵略者，也没有通过任何决议要以色列军队从他们霸占的阿拉伯土地上撤退。
    苏修在“声明”中煞有介事地叫嚷“现在安理会负有重大的任务”，说什么他们“将一如既往地准备同一切爱好和平的国家合作”，以便在安理会上“建设性地解决”中东问题，特别是以色列撤军问题。其实，安理会同联合国大会一样，都是美帝苏修推行强权政治和实行反革命交易的场所。他们蓄意把皮球踢来踢去，先由安理会踢到联合国大会，再由联合国大会踢回到安理会，这无非是为了愚弄阿拉伯人民和世界人民，千方百计诱使阿拉伯人民屈服让步。
    苏修集团还在“声明”中再一次玩弄阴险的两面手法，宣称他们今后“仍将在阿拉伯国家争取合法权利的正义斗争中给它们以政治支持，帮助它们恢复和发展经济，加强国防”等等，妄图继续以糖衣炮弹向阿拉伯国家和人民进攻。
    但是，不管苏修继续玩弄什么花招，都绝对掩盖不了他们积极充当美帝的头号帮凶，叛卖阿拉伯人民利益的卑劣行径。阿拉伯人民已经识破了苏修叛徒集团的真面目，吃够了苏修的苦头。他们越来越认识到，只有依靠自己的力量和进行坚持不懈的斗争，才能维护自己的民族独立，挫败美帝及其走狗以色列的侵略。阿拉伯人民必将粉碎美帝和苏修的一切阴谋诡计。
