In the midst of the revolutionary criticism and struggle, more than 130 middle schools in Beijing, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, have undergone military and political training. They have achieved the broadest revolutionary unity, with the proletarian revolutionary faction as the core and the teaching class as the foundation. Revolutionary "three-in-one" temporary power organs have been established. Over 50 of these schools have already formally resumed classes and are carrying out the revolution. They are models of revolutionary unity and "three-in-one" leadership in Beijing's middle schools, vanguards of revolutionary criticism and struggle, and pioneers in resuming classes and carrying out the revolution, criticism, and reform.

The great leader Chairman Mao has instructed: "The army should conduct military training in phases for universities, middle schools, and high-grade elementary schools, and participate in the work of opening schools, rectifying organizations, establishing 'three-in-one' leadership organs, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and reform." The more than 100 middle schools and the PLA soldiers responsible for military training have resolutely carried out Chairman Mao's brilliant instructions, making the situation of the Cultural Revolution in these schools increasingly better. Revolutionary criticism has promoted revolutionary unity, and revolutionary unity has further advanced revolutionary criticism. After achieving revolutionary unity, the broad revolutionary teachers and students have launched a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, creating a new high tide of concentrated and powerful criticism and struggle. They have combined the struggle to criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party with the struggle, criticism, and reform in their own schools.

The struggle practice of these more than 130 middle schools in Beijing provides excellent experience for achieving revolutionary unity in middle schools.

Deeply carry out revolutionary criticism, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and lay a solid ideological foundation for achieving the broadest revolutionary unity.

The process of achieving the broadest revolutionary unity in middle schools is also the process of educating broad revolutionary teachers and students with the two-line struggle. The capitalist reactionary line concocted by the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party is the root cause of the ideological estrangement and emotional opposition among teachers and students, among classmates, and among teachers. It is also the root cause of the "internal war" among revolutionary mass organizations. Therefore, thoroughly criticizing this capitalist reactionary line, eliminating the estrangement among teachers and students, and removing ideological obstacles have become a key to achieving revolutionary unity in middle schools.

After the military and political training began, the PLA soldiers, with the two-line struggle as the key and Mao Zedong Thought as the weapon, actively mobilized the broad revolutionary teachers and students to expose, denounce, criticize, and struggle against the capitalist reactionary line. This helped the broad revolutionary teachers and students to distinguish between enemies and ourselves, raised their awareness, and unified their understanding, laying a solid ideological foundation for achieving the broadest revolutionary unity.

In the process of criticizing the capitalist reactionary line, it is necessary to direct the spearhead at the concocters of this reactionary line, so that the broad revolutionary teachers and students can concentrate their hatred on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. Otherwise, such criticism will deflect the direction of the struggle, inevitably causing deeper estrangement, greater opposition, and greater splits among the masses. Initially, some teachers and students who had been persecuted by the capitalist reactionary line advocated, "Criticize and struggle against whoever implemented the capitalist reactionary line." Later, under the correct guidance of the PLA soldiers, they not only did not direct the spearhead at the general masses who had been deceived, but also adopted the principle of "unity-criticism-unity" towards revolutionary cadres who had once implemented the capitalist reactionary line, providing them with enthusiastic help.

From the practice of these schools, it can be seen that starting from class education to criticize the capitalist reactionary line is an effective way to guide the broad revolutionary teachers and students to concentrate their hatred on the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. They organized revolutionary teachers and students to study Chairman Mao's brilliant work "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," distinguishing "who are our enemies? Who are our friends?" These schools also universally adopted methods such as bitter memory meetings, denunciation meetings, visits, and interviews for mass self-education, widely mobilizing teachers and students to expose and criticize the capitalist reactionary line, making the broad revolutionary teachers and students more clearly recognize the evil intentions of the handful of people who formulated the capitalist reactionary line, greatly arousing their hatred towards the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. Some masses who had been deceived quickly awakened, decisively broke with the capitalist reactionary line, and returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The warriors of some revolutionary organizations also more clearly realized that the teachers and students who had been persecuted and deceived were all victims of the capitalist reactionary line and were all class brothers. The revolutionary criticism and struggle greatly promoted the unity of the broad revolutionary teachers and students, making them have common thoughts, common language, and common actions.

The proletarian revolutionary faction must correctly treat itself, correctly treat other revolutionary mass organizations, and correctly treat the deceived masses.

The proletarian revolutionary faction must actively promote revolutionary unity. First of all, it must correctly treat itself. In the process of achieving revolutionary unity, the struggle between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview runs through the proletarian revolutionary organizations, which is the struggle between "public" and "private." The proletarian revolutionary faction must, while transforming the objective world, transform its own subjective world, overthrow the "private" character, and seize the power of the "private" character in one's own mind. Comrade Lin Biao teaches us: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. The revolution also needs to revolutionize ourselves. Without revolutionizing ourselves, the revolution cannot be well carried out." The PLA soldiers conducting military and political training in these schools actively organized the revolutionary faction to study Chairman Mao's "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party" and the brilliant works of the "Three Old Articles," helping and guiding them to open the door for rectification, break private thoughts, and establish public thoughts, overcoming various non-proletarian thoughts, regarding the revolution as the heart, regarding the overall situation as important, and actively contributing to the achievement of revolutionary unity.

The experience of these schools proves that the proletarian revolutionary faction can only correctly treat itself, overcome localism, small-groupism, and sectarianism, and other non-proletarian thoughts, can it correctly treat other revolutionary mass organizations, consciously criticize the erroneous thoughts of "unity must rely on me" and "only I am revolutionary, only I am 'left,'" can it actively eliminate "internal wars," seek great unity, tolerate small differences, and make various revolutionary mass organizations first unite and unite, and struggle together for the achievement of revolutionary unity.

Some young revolutionaries influenced by anarchist thoughts did not believe that the majority of the masses wanted revolution, did not pay attention to uniting the majority, and especially did not pay attention to uniting and helping the deceived masses and revolutionary cadres who had made mistakes. However, when they armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, overcame anarchist thoughts, and distinguished between two different types of contradictions, they could correctly treat the deceived masses and revolutionary cadres who had made mistakes, and truly understand the truth that "only by liberating all mankind can the proletariat finally liberate itself." They followed Chairman Mao's teaching: "The attitude towards backward people is not to despise them, look down upon them, but to approach them, unite with them, persuade them, and encourage them to advance," enthusiastically helping the deceived masses and revolutionary cadres who had made mistakes, earnestly and painstakingly doing their political and ideological work, making them put down their burdens, correct their mistakes, and quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

To achieve the broadest revolutionary unity in middle schools, it is necessary to take the proletarian revolutionary faction as the core and the teaching class as the foundation.

To achieve the broadest revolutionary unity in middle schools, it is necessary to take the proletarian revolutionary faction as the core and the teaching class as the foundation. Practice has proven that this form of revolutionary unity, with the revolutionary faction as the core and the teaching class as the foundation, is a good form of revolutionary unity in middle schools. Achieving revolutionary unity with the teaching class as the foundation is not only conducive to organizing a "vast revolutionary army," conducive to carrying out revolutionary criticism, but also conducive to resuming classes and carrying out the revolution, conducive to deeply carrying out the struggle, criticism, and reform. In the process of achieving the school-wide unity with the teaching class as the foundation, it is necessary to insist on the principle of taking the proletarian revolutionary faction as the core. Because the revolutionary faction is the vanguard of the proletarian cultural revolution, is the most resolute defender and executor of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Only such revolutionary unity can better implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and ensure the victory of the proletarian cultural revolution.

The experience of these schools shows that to ensure the achievement of the broadest revolutionary unity with the proletarian revolutionary faction as the core and the teaching class as the foundation, it is first necessary to achieve the unity of all revolutionary mass organizations in the school, making the revolutionary faction politically and organizationally superior, and then unify the return to classes to carry out the revolution, achieving the school-wide revolutionary unity with the teaching class as the foundation with them as the core. Generally, middle schools have many organizations but few people, each fighting on their own. If the revolutionary mass organizations do not first unite, they will not form a unified force after returning to the class, and the unity of the teaching class cannot be guaranteed to be with the revolutionary faction as the core.

In Beijing No. 91 Middle School, the comrades of the People's Liberation Army executing the military and political training mission are exchanging experiences with revolutionary students on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

    贯彻执行毛主席关于军政训练指示的巨大胜利
    北京一百三十多所中学实现革命大联合
    各校掀起活学活用毛主席著作新高潮，集中火力进行革命的大批判，搞好本校的斗批改
    据新华社十三日讯　本社记者述评：在革命的大批判、大斗争中，北京市一百三十多所中等学校的广大革命师生，在解放军的帮助下，经过军政训练，实现了以无产阶级革命派为核心、以教学班为基础的最广泛的革命大联合，建立了革命“三结合”的临时权力机构。其中五十多所学校的革命师生，已经正式复课闹革命。他们是北京市中等学校革命大联合和革命“三结合”的模范，是革命大批判、大斗争的先锋，是复课闹革命、深入进行斗批改的闯将。
    伟大领袖毛主席指示：“军队应分期分批对大学、中学和小学高年级实行军训，并且参预关于开学、整顿组织、建立三结合领导机关和实行斗、批、改的工作。”这一百多所中等学校的广大革命师生和担负军训任务的解放军指战员，最坚决地执行了毛主席的英明指示，使这些学校无产阶级文化大革命的形势越来越好。革命的大批判促进了革命的大联合，革命的大联合又推进了革命的大批判。广大革命师生大联合以后，又掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，出现了目标集中、火力猛烈的大批判、大斗争的新高潮。他们把批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争，努力同本学校的斗批改结合起来。
    北京市这一百三十多所中等学校的斗争实践，为中学的革命大联合提供了很好的经验。
    深入开展革命的大批判，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，为实现最广泛的革命大联合打下牢固的思想基础
    实现中学最广泛的革命大联合的过程，就是对广大革命师生进行两条路线教育的过程。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所炮制的资产阶级反动路线，是造成中学师生之间、同学之间、教师之间思想隔阂、感情对立的祸根，也是革命群众组织间“打内战”的总根子。因此，彻底批判这条资产阶级反动路线，消除师生隔阂，扫除思想障碍，就成为实现中学革命大联合的一个关键。
    这些学校的军政训练开始后，解放军指战员就以两条路线斗争为纲，以毛泽东思想为武器，积极发动广大革命师生，对资产阶级反动路线进行了大揭露、大控诉、大批判和大斗争，使广大革命师生分清敌我，提高了觉悟，统一了认识，为实现最广泛的革命大联合打下了牢固的思想基础。
    在批判资产阶级反动路线的过程中，要切实把矛头指向这条反动路线的炮制者，使广大革命师生把仇恨集中在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派身上。
    否则，这种大批判就会转移斗争的大方向，势必要造成群众之间更深的隔阂，更大的对立，更大的分裂。开始，一些受资产阶级反动路线迫害的师生，主张“谁执行了资产阶级反动路线，就批判谁，斗争谁”，后来，在解放军指战员的正确引导下，不仅没有把矛头指向一般受蒙蔽的群众，就是对一度执行了资产阶级反动路线的革命干部，也采取了“团结——批评——团结”的原则，进行了热忱的帮助。
    从这些学校的实践来看，从阶级教育入手批判资产阶级反动路线，是引导广大革命师生把仇恨集中到党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派身上的一种有效的办法。他们组织革命师生学习毛主席的光辉著作《中国社会各阶级的分析》，分清“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？”这些学校还普遍采取了忆苦会、控诉会和参观、访问等群众自我教育的方法，广泛发动师生对资产阶级反动路线开展揭发和批判，使广大革命师生更加认清了制定资产阶级反动路线一小撮人的罪恶目的，大大激发了他们对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的仇恨。一些过去受蒙蔽的群众很快地觉悟过来，大杀回马枪，决心和资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。一些革命组织的战士们也更清楚地认识到：受迫害和受蒙蔽的师生，都是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，都是阶级兄弟。革命的大批判和大斗争，大大促进了广大革命师生的团结，使他们有了共同的思想、共同的语言、共同的行动。
    无产阶级革命派必须正确对待自己，正确对待其他革命群众组织，正确对待受蒙蔽群众
    无产阶级革命派要积极促进革命的大联合，首先必须正确对待自己。在实现革命大联合的过程中，无产阶级革命组织内部贯穿着无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的斗争，也就是“公”与“私”的斗争。无产阶级革命派必须在改造客观世界的同时，改造自己的主观世界，打倒“私”字，夺自己头脑中“私”字的权。林彪同志教导我们说：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”在这些学校进行军政训练的解放军指战员，积极组织革命派学习毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》和“老三篇”等光辉著作，帮助和引导他们开门整风，破私立公，克服各种非无产阶级思想，以革命为怀，以大局为重，积极为实现革命的大联合贡献力量。
    这些学校的经验证明：无产阶级革命派只有正确地对待自己，克服了本位主义、小团体主义、风头主义等非无产阶级思想，才能够正确对待其他革命群众组织，自觉地批判“要联合必须向我靠拢”的“唯我革命、唯我独‘左’”的错误思想，才能主动消除“内战”，求大同，存小异，使各革命群众组织首先联合起来，团结起来，共同为实现革命的大联合而斗争。
    有些革命小将受了无政府主义思潮的影响，不大相信大多数群众是要革命的，不注意团结大多数，尤其不注意团结和帮助那些受蒙蔽的群众和犯了错误的革命干部。可是，当他们用毛泽东思想武装了自己，克服了无政府主义思想，分清了两类不同性质的矛盾以后，他们就能够正确对待受蒙蔽的群众和犯了错误的革命干部，也才能真正理解“只有解放全人类，才能最后解放无产阶级自己”这个真理。他们遵照毛主席“对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进”的教导，热情地帮助受蒙蔽的群众和犯了错误的革命干部，认真地、刻苦地做他们的政治思想工作，使他们放下包袱，改正错误，迅速回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    实现中学最广泛的革命大联合，必须以无产阶级革命派为核心，以教学班为基础
    实现中学最广泛的革命大联合，必须以无产阶级革命派为核心，以教学班为基础。实践证明，这种以革命派为核心，以教学班为基础的革命大联合，是中学革命大联合的好形式。以教学班为基础实现革命大联合，不仅有利于组织“浩浩荡荡的革命军”，有利于开展革命的大批判，而且有利于复课闹革命，有利于深入进行斗批改。在实现以教学班为基础的全校大联合过程中，必须坚持以无产阶级革命派为核心的原则。因为革命派是无产阶级文化大革命的先锋，是毛主席无产阶级革命路线最坚决的捍卫者和执行者。只有这样的革命大联合，才能更好地贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，才能保证把无产阶级文化大革命胜利进行到底。
    这些学校的经验说明，要保证实现以无产阶级革命派为核心、以教学班为基础的最广泛的革命大联合，首先要实现全校革命群众组织的大联合，使革命派在政治上组织上都占了优势，然后再统一回班闹革命，以他们为核心实现以教学班为基础的全校革命大联合。中等学校一般都是组织多，人数少，各自为战。如果革命群众组织不首先联合起来，回到班后就形不成一个统一的力量，教学班的大联合就无法保证以革命派为核心。（附图片）
