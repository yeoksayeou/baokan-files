	Japanese Miners Launch Struggle Against Oppression for Survival
	Over 2,000 miners from the Miike Coal Mine in Japan have been on strike since the 10th. At the same time, more than 130 family members of miners who were killed or maimed in a coal mine gas explosion have defied capitalist restrictions to join the struggle. More than 70 of these family members marched into the 300-meter-deep mine shaft, holding a sit-in protest at the very spot where their loved ones perished. United in their grief and anger, they fearlessly defied the oppressors and continued their struggle for eight days and nights. In the mine, they encouraged each other, sang revolutionary songs, and stood united as one. Their courage and determination have earned the admiration and support of the miners and the revolutionary people of Japan.

	Malaysian People Protest Against Fascist Rule
	On July 20th, workers and youth in Kuala Lumpur, the capital of Malaysia, held demonstrations in three locations to protest against the fascist rule of the Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew clique. The demonstrators chanted slogans as they marched through the streets of Kuala Lumpur. The Rahman-Lee Kuan Yew clique quickly deployed large numbers of police and "riot control" forces to brutally suppress the protests. The enraged crowd fearlessly fought back with stones.

	On July 18th, over a thousand people held a large-scale demonstration in Penang, northern Malaysia. The fascist police and "riot control" forces threw numerous tear gas canisters at the crowd in an attempt to suppress the anti-fascist uprising of the people of Malaysia (including Singapore).

	Sudanese Prime Minister Vows to Continue Fighting Against U.S.-Israeli Aggression
	Sudanese Prime Minister Muhammad Ahmad Mahgoub stated on the 20th in Khartoum, "Arab countries will continue the struggle to liberate every inch of Arab land."

	Mahgoub made these remarks upon his return from Cairo and New York at Khartoum Airport. When Mahgoub mentioned this, the crowd at the airport shouted, "Down with American imperialism!"

	Mahgoub said, "We have already begun preparations to unite the Arabs so that we can resist politically and militarily in the future."

	Iraqi Paper Calls for Arab Nations to Withdraw from the United Nations
	The Iraqi newspaper *Al-Thawra Al-Arabiya* published an article on the 20th calling for Arab nations to withdraw from the United Nations. The article pointed out, "It is unreasonable for Arabs to place all their trust in the United Nations while forgetting the plots the United Nations has devised against us."

	The article stated that the United Nations' debates on U.S.-Israeli aggression against Arab countries "have fully exposed the United Nations as a tool for maintaining imperialist interests, supporting aggression, and legalizing aggression in the world."

	Puerto Rican Patriots Oppose "Citizen Vote"
	Over 10,000 patriotic Puerto Ricans, despite colonial repression, held a massive demonstration in the capital, San Juan, on the 16th, firmly opposing the "citizen vote" manipulated by the U.S. colonial authorities.

	This so-called "citizen vote" is scheduled to take place on July 23rd. According to the colonial authorities, the purpose of the "vote" is to "decide" the status of Puerto Rico: whether it should become an "independent" nation, remain a U.S. "free associated state" (essentially a U.S. colony), or simply declare Puerto Rico as the 51st state of the U.S., blatantly annexing Puerto Rico.

	British Unemployment Reaches Over 500,000
	In July, the number of unemployed in Britain reached its highest level for the month since 1940. According to figures released by the Ministry of Labour, including Northern Ireland, the total number of unemployed in Britain is 543,680, nearly double the unemployment figure for July last year.
