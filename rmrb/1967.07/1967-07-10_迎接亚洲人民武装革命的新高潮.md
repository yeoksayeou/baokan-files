In recent days, from our neighboring countries to the south, India and Burma, we have received news that is exhilarating: the Indian people, under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, have fired the first shot of armed revolution and established a red area where the people are in power in Darjeeling County. The people of Burma, under the leadership of the Communist Party of Burma, have persisted in armed struggle for nearly twenty years, creating a very good revolutionary situation.

We, the soldiers and officers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed on the northeastern border of our motherland, enthusiastically applaud and firmly support the victories achieved by the Indian people and the Burmese people!

The armed struggles of the Indian people and the Burmese people once again prove that the revolutionary truth pointed out by our great leader Chairman Mao, "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," is being understood and applied by more and more revolutionary people around the world, producing an increasingly great influence, and promoting the advancement of the world revolution.

Everyone knows that the Indian National Congress government and the Ne Win reactionary government in Burma are anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary reactionaries. They rely on the United States and the Soviet revisionists abroad, and suppress the people's revolution at home, pushing the vast majority of people into the abyss of hunger, poverty, and disaster.

How do the reactionaries in India and Burma maintain their reactionary rule? Isn't it with bayonets and gun barrels! How can the people of India and Burma struggle for survival and liberation? They have investigated and found that the enemy has knives in their hands to kill people, so the people must also take up knives, knife against knife, gun against gun, use the revolutionary gun barrel to eliminate the counter-revolutionary gun barrel, use revolutionary armed struggle to oppose counter-revolutionary armed struggle. This is the only correct path for the oppressed people to struggle for liberation. The Burmese people have already done this, and now the Indian people are starting to do this. They are doing the right thing and doing it well. As long as they keep going and go all the way, they will definitely achieve final victory.

Today, throughout Southeast Asia and the entire Asian continent, thunder rumbles and fires burn, and the revolutionary situation is inspiring. The people of South Vietnam have already fought the American imperialist invaders to the point of exhaustion. The patriotic military and civilians of Laos are advancing in victory in the anti-American war. The armed struggle of the Thai people is growing stronger and stronger. The armed forces of the Burmese people are rapidly growing and strengthening in battle. Now, the peasants in the Darjeeling region of India have risen up in revolt and launched an armed revolutionary struggle. In Indonesia, today is also a time of "hearing thunder in silence," on the eve of a new revolutionary storm. In the midst of the people's armed revolutionary fires burning all over the sky, what imperialism, what revisionism, what reactionaries, no matter how ferocious and evil they are today, will all be burned to death and reduced to ashes in the end!

We, the Chinese People's Liberation Army, are a revolutionary army created and nurtured by Chairman Mao himself. It is under the guidance of Chairman Mao's thought of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" that we have used the gun barrel to win the people's heaven. We feel the most intimate and excited about the armed revolution of the Indian people, the Burmese people, and the revolutionary people of various countries in Asia. We salute the revolutionary gun barrels of the Asian people. Let us enthusiastically welcome the new high tide of armed revolution of the Asian people!

　　迎接亚洲人民武装革命的新高潮
　　黑龙江省军区某部　李志民　王桂成　韩维林
    这几天来，从我国南面的邻国印度和缅甸传来了令人振奋的消息：印度人民在印共革命派的领导下，打响了武装革命的第一炮，在大吉岭县建立了人民掌权的红色地区。缅甸人民在缅甸共产党领导下坚持了近二十年的武装斗争，打出了一片大好的革命形势。
    我们坚守在祖国东北边疆的中国人民解放军指战员们，对印度人民和缅甸人民取得的胜利，表示热烈的欢呼，坚决的支持！
    印度人民和缅甸人民的武装斗争，再一次证明：我们伟大领袖毛主席所指出的“枪杆子里面出政权”的革命真理，正在被越来越多的世界各国革命人民所理解运用，产生着越来越巨大的影响，推动着世界革命的前进。
    谁都知道，印度国大党政府和缅甸奈温反动政府，是反共反人民反革命的反动派。它们对外投靠美帝苏修，对内镇压人民革命，把广大人民推进了饥饿、贫困和灾难的深渊。
    印度和缅甸的反动派靠什么来维持他们的反动统治？还不是刺刀和枪杆子！印度和缅甸人民怎样才能争生存，求解放？他们经过调查，发现敌人手里有刀，用来杀人，因此，人民也只有同样拿起刀来，刀对刀，枪对枪，用革命的枪杆子来消灭反革命的枪杆子，用革命的武装反对反革命的武装。这是被压迫人民争取解放的唯一正确的道路。缅甸人民已经这样干了，印度人民现在也开始这样干了。他们干得对，干得好。他们只要干下去，干到底，就一定能够取得最后胜利。
    今天，在整个东南亚和整个亚洲，春雷滚滚，烽火连天，革命形势振奋人心。南越人民已经把美帝国主义侵略者打得焦头烂额。老挝爱国军民在抗美战争中胜利前进。泰国人民武装斗争的星星之火正在越燃越旺。缅甸的人民武装力量在战斗中迅速成长壮大。现在印度大吉岭地区的农民又揭竿而起，发动了革命武装斗争。在印度尼西亚，今天也是“于无声处听惊雷”，处在新的革命大风暴的前夕。在这漫天燃烧着的人民武装革命的烈火中，什么帝国主义，什么修正主义，什么反动派，别看它们今天还这样张牙舞爪，穷凶极恶，到头来都要被活活烧死，化为灰烬！
    我们中国人民解放军是毛主席亲自缔造和培育的革命军队。我们就是在毛主席的“枪杆子里面出政权”的思想指导下，用枪杆子打出人民天下来的。我们对印度人民、缅甸人民和亚洲各国革命人民的武装革命感到最亲切，最兴奋。我们向亚洲人民的革命的枪杆子致敬。让我们热烈欢呼亚洲人民武装革命的新高潮的到来吧！
