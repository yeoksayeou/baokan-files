The film "The Enemy at the Gate," which was hailed by a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the cultural sphere as having a "good script, good direction, good cinematography, and good acting," is a vivid example of a reactionary film that deviates from the teachings of Mao Zedong Thought and betrays the path of people's war. It is meticulously crafted according to the fallacies of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party, serving as a poisonous weed that opposes Chairman Mao's people's war ideology, advocates class reconciliation, and promotes bourgeois humanism.

The film "The Enemy at the Gate" fundamentally denies armed struggle, downplays the immense power of people's war, and defames Chairman Mao's unshakable truth that "war resolves problems" and "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." In the film, the victory of the revolution does not rely on the masses, on people's war, or on the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, but on the surrenderist philosophy of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party, who bow and scrape before the enemy. They place the hope of victory on the "benevolence" and "wisdom" of the enemy—Zhao Chongwu and Zheng Hanshen. The director goes to great lengths to have our military's intelligence department head, Director Jiang, to persuade and win over the enemy. Thus, after a round of earnest "political bargaining," "a new scene unfolds," and Zhao Chongwu "lays down his butcher's knife and becomes a Buddha." The "peaceful liberation" depicted in the film is a diagram of China's Khrushchev's surrenderist line; and this pleading figure for peace who kowtows to the enemy—Director Jiang—is precisely the incarnation of China's Khrushchev.

China's Khrushchev is the biggest "parliamentary fanatic." As early as October 1937, he advocated surrendering the people's guns, urging all armed forces in North China to form a united army "under the leadership of the Central Military Commission of the National Government." By 1946, he was advocating that "the main form of struggle in the Chinese revolution has shifted to peaceful, parliamentary struggle, and the struggle is legal mass struggle and parliamentary struggle." He bluntly stated: "The peaceful democratic period is not about brandishing guns but about entering the city with ballots." The reactionary film "The Enemy at the Gate" is produced based on such fallacies.

The film "The Enemy at the Gate" not only fundamentally attacks Chairman Mao's people's war ideology but also maliciously distorts our military's political work. Every move and word of Director Jiang, who specializes in political work, cannot escape the fallacy of "class reconciliation" advocated by the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party. He is full of flattery before the enemy, and his mouth is full of the rotten goods of bourgeois humanism. Look, in our military's intelligence department, when the captured enemy regiment commander Zheng Hanshen's wife mentions losing her child, Director Jiang seems to be shocked by an electric current, immediately showing concern and asking, "What happened to the child?" Then, he generously agrees, "Alright, we will send someone to help you find it, and we will send it back to you." Without doing any political work, he releases the enemy. When Director Jiang personally enters the lion's den and delivers the child, the enemy regiment commander Zheng Hanshen, who had been steadfastly following Zhao Chongwu, suddenly declares, "If the commander does not agree, our regiment will do it alone," in a fit of indignation and emotion over the humiliation of his wife and the delivery of the child. This criminally guilty reactionary officer, who had been stubbornly shouting, "Failure means death, kill me if you must, execute me if you must!" just a short while ago, has now, under Director Jiang's humanistic influence, transformed into one with the people's army "as one." This is pure "class reconciliation" theory. Director Jiang, in front of Zhao Chongwu, also engages in "class reconciliation," recalling a segment of "drinking tea and discussing the Chinese revolution" by the Xuanwu Lake twenty years ago with his "brother Chongwu," endlessly entangled, both completely immersed in "nostalgic feelings," their intimate demeanor making one nauseous! Where is the distinction between enemy and us? Where is the struggle between revolution and counter-revolution? The film's director, however, uses such "old friendships" and a telegram from Zhao Chongwu that he was about to be "eliminated" to urge Zhao Chongwu to surrender and rebel. Here, personal "grievances" and "grudges" replace class struggle, and bourgeois humanism replaces our military's serious political work.

The reactionary film "The Enemy at the Gate" and its supporters' advocacy of "class reconciliation" and bourgeois humanism are poison disguised as candy. During the revolutionary war period, it is used to cover up the butcher's hideous face and consolidate the ruling position of the exploiting class. In the period of socialist revolution, its evil purpose is to attack the dictatorship of the proletariat, numb the fighting will of the revolutionary people, pave the way for the restoration of capitalism, and create public opinion for the counter-revolutionary activities of landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists.

The reactionary film "The Enemy at the Gate" is such a poisonous weed with potent toxins. Cut the grass and dig out the roots, catch the ringleader. Now it is completely proven that it was released in 1964 amidst the tight drumbeats of counter-revolutionary restoration, fully in line with the needs of the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party to conspire to usurp the Party, the army, and the government. The reactionary film "The Enemy at the Gate" is a genuine counter-revolutionary manifesto.

Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the poisonous weed film "The Enemy at the Gate," completely denounce and overthrow China's Khrushchev, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

    中国的赫鲁晓夫的传声筒

    被文艺界一小撮反革命修正主义分子封为“剧本好、导演好、摄影好、演员好”的“四好影片”《兵临城下》，是一部离毛泽东思想之“经”、叛人民战争之“道”的反动影片的活标本。它完全是按照党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的谬论，精心炮制出来的一株反对毛主席的人民战争思想，鼓吹阶级调和论和宣扬资产阶级人性论的大毒草。
    影片《兵临城下》根本否定武装斗争，抹煞了人民战争的巨大威力，诋毁毛主席的关于“战争解决问题”、“枪杆子里面出政权”这一颠扑不破的伟大真理。在影片里，革命的胜利不是依靠群众，不是依靠人民战争，不是依靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，而是依靠党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的那一套对敌人卑躬屈膝的投降主义哲学。他们把战争的胜利寄托在“善良”和“明智”的敌人——赵崇武和郑汉臣身上。编导者煞费心机地让我军敌工部姜部长去感召敌人、笼络敌人。就这样，经过他一番苦口婆心的“政治交易”后，于是“柳暗花明又一村”，赵崇武“放下屠刀，立地成佛”了。影片中所描写的“和平解放”的这一切，成了中国的赫鲁晓夫投降主义路线的图解；而这个向敌人奴颜婢膝的乞求和平者——姜部长，也正是中国的赫鲁晓夫的化身。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫是最大的“议会迷”。他早在一九三七年十月就主张交出人民的枪杆子，要华北一切武装组成联军“受国民政府中央军事委员会的领导”。到一九四六年，他又鼓吹什么“中国革命的主要斗争形式已变为和平的、议会的，斗争是合法的群众斗争和议会斗争”。他露骨地说：“和平民主时期不是靠枪杆子逞锋，而是靠选票进城”。反动影片《兵临城下》就是根据这样的谬论炮制出来的。
    影片《兵临城下》不但从根本上攻击了毛主席的人民战争思想，而且恶毒地歪曲了我军的政治工作。专门做政治工作的姜部长的一举一动，一言一语，都离不开党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所宣扬的“阶级调和”的谬论。他在敌人面前媚态十足，满嘴是腐朽不堪的资产阶级人性论的破烂货。你看，在我军敌工部里，当被俘的敌团长郑汉臣的老婆一提到丢了孩子的时候，姜部长仿佛被电流触动了一下，马上关心备至地问道：“孩子怎么啦？”接着就慷慨地答应：“好吧，我们派人帮你们找，找到了送给你们。”根本没作任何政治工作，就把敌人放了。当姜部长亲入虎穴，送子上门后，死心塌地追随赵崇武的敌团长郑汉臣，竟在“辱妻之恨”“送子之情”的激愤和感动下，对于起义的事断然表示：“师长要是不愿意，我们团单独干。”这个罪恶累累的反动军官，不久前还在顽固地高叫：“不成功便成仁，要杀就杀，要毙就毙！”曾几何时，在姜部长的人性感化下，摇身一变就与人民军队“合二而一”了。这是十足的“阶级调和”论。姜部长在赵崇武面前，更是大搞“阶级调和”，他面对他的“崇武兄”，回忆二十年前在玄武湖畔的一段“一面喝着清茶，一面谈着中国革命”的旧情，无限缠绵，两人完全陶醉在“追忆旧情”之中，那副亲昵之状令人作呕！那里还有敌我之分？那里还有革命与反革命的斗争？影片的编导者却偏偏以这样的“旧友之交”，用赵崇武将被“剪除”的一封电报，来促使赵崇武投诚起义。在这里，人与人之间的“恩”“怨”代替了阶级斗争，资产阶级的人性论代替了我军严肃的政治工作。
    反动影片《兵临城下》及其支持者所鼓吹的“阶级调和”论和资产阶级人性论，是裹着糖衣的砒霜。在革命战争时期宣扬它，为的是掩饰刽子手的狰狞面目，巩固剥削阶级的统治地位。在社会主义革命时期宣扬它，其罪恶的目的是攻击无产阶级专政，麻痹革命人民的斗争意志，为资本主义的复辟鸣锣开道，为地、富、反、坏、右分子翻天制造舆论。
    反动影片《兵临城下》就是这样一株含有烈性毒汁的大毒草。斩草除根，擒贼擒王。现在完全证明，它在一九六四年一片反革命复辟的紧锣密鼓声中出笼，完全是配合党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派阴谋篡党、篡军、篡政的需要。反动影片《兵临城下》是地地道道的反革命宣言书。
    让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判大毒草影片《兵临城下》，把中国的赫鲁晓夫批臭打倒，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
