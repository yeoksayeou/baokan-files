How should a person grow? On this question, two classes have two different answers.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "The successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution are produced in the midst of the people's struggle, and are tempered in the great storms of revolution." However, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, in his "Cultivation," blathers: "If a person wants to make progress, he must work hard and seriously engage in self-cultivation."

How can one be tempered and grow in the great storms of revolution? That is to throw oneself into the fiery class struggle. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Class struggle, some classes triumph, some classes are eliminated. This is history, this is the history of civilization over thousands of years." Proletarian revolutionaries must engage in class struggle, overthrow the exploiting classes, seize political power from the exploiting classes, and hold onto political power.

But what is the "serious engagement in self-cultivation" talked about in "Cultivation"? It is to pick up the feudal rubbish from a thousand years ago, to make people "examine oneself three times a day," to make people "hear nothing outside the window, read only the words of the sages." In short, it is to make people detach themselves from the real class struggle, detach themselves from the revolution.

What kind of people can such "cultivation" cultivate? It can only produce parasites, bourgeois masters, traitors, and revisionists.

Can we take this road of "cultivating the self and nurturing virtue," becoming more and more "cultivated"? No, not in a million years. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, throw ourselves into the class struggle, and wage class struggle. I have personal experience in this regard.

I am paralyzed in both legs and have a disabled left hand. I have been bedridden for seven whole years. According to the "cultivation" theory, I should be even more apolitical, detached from the masses, and engage in solitary self-cultivation and self-improvement. But would that be beneficial to the people? Would that make me progress? No, absolutely not. If I did that, I would only become a useless person lying in bed all day eating and drinking. I resolutely will not take that road. Chairman Mao, in the brilliant "Three Articles," teaches us, "Our army is completely for the liberation of the people, and it works wholeheartedly for the people's interests." A person may have great or small abilities, but as long as he has the spirit of selflessness, he can become a person of benefit to the people. Although I am paralyzed, I still have a brain to study Chairman Mao's works, a mouth to propagate Mao Zedong Thought, and a right hand to write articles criticizing the bourgeoisie. For seven years, I have never left the revolutionary torrent. During the socialist education movement, I stood up with my class brothers to resolutely expose bad people and bad deeds. The class enemy cursed me from behind: "Your body is like a broken ship, your mouth is like an iron clamp." I heard this and not only did I not lose heart, but I fought even harder. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, I was in the hospital for treatment. Should I rest at home or join the battle? Fight, resolutely fight! I immediately returned to the brigade, attended meetings, made speeches, and wrote articles to verbally and in writing condemn the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. In this way, although I cannot move, I am still on the battlefield of class struggle, galloping with the broad masses.

To go to the stormy seas of class struggle for tempering is the road for all revolutionaries to grow. In our country, how many revolutionary martyrs, how many outstanding Communist Party members, have grown up by following Chairman Mao's teachings! Class struggle is the crucible for tempering proletarian revolutionaries. In this great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, it has tempered batch after batch of Red Guards and a batch after batch of proletarian revolutionary warriors who are determined to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

I can, under the nurturing of Mao Zedong Thought, go to the real class struggle and mass struggle, experience the storms and see the world. This is my greatest happiness, my greatest progress. I vow to walk this road for life.

Forge ahead in stormy seas, don't "cultivate the self and nurture virtue"! Let the idealist "cultivation" theory go to hell!

　　要在大风大浪中锻炼　不要“修身养性”
　　学习毛主席著作积极分子  洪泾大队贫农社员  沈玉英
    一个人应该怎样成长？对这个问题，两个阶级有两种不同的答案。
    毛主席指出：“无产阶级革命事业的接班人，是在群众斗争中产生的，是在革命大风大浪的锻炼中成长的。”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，却在《修养》中胡说：“一个人要求得进步，就必须下苦功，郑重其事地去进行自我修养”。
    怎样才能在革命的大风大浪中锻炼成长？那就是投身到火热的阶级斗争中去。毛主席教导我们：“阶级斗争，一些阶级胜利了，一些阶级消灭了。这就是历史，这就是几千年的文明史。”无产阶级革命者，就是要搞阶级斗争，推翻剥削阶级，从剥削阶级手里夺取政权，掌握政权。
    而《修养》里讲的“郑重其事地去进行自我修养”是什么货色？那就是拾起千百年前的封建破烂，让人们“吾日三省吾身”，让人们“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读圣贤书”……。一句话，让人们脱离现实的阶级斗争，脱离革命。
    这样的“修养”能“养”出什么人来？只能出寄生虫，资产阶级老爷、叛徒、修正主义分子。
    我们能走这条“修身养性”，越养越“修”的道路吗？不能，一万个不能。我们必须遵循毛主席的教导，投身阶级斗争，大搞阶级斗争。我自己在这方面是深有体会的。
    我下肢瘫痪，左手残废，卧病整整七年了。按照“修养”论，我比别人更应该不问政治，脱离群众，独个儿去苦修苦练。但是那样做，能对人民有利吗？能使自己进步吗？不能，绝对不能。那样做，我就只能成为一个成年躺在床上吃喝的废物。我坚决不走那条路。毛主席在金光闪闪的“老三篇”中教导我们，“我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”一个人能力有大小，但只要有毫无自私自利之心的精神，就可以成为一个有益于人民的人。我虽然瘫痪了，但是还有脑子可以学习毛主席著作，还有嘴可以宣传毛泽东思想，还有一只右手可以写文章批判资产阶级。七年来，我一直没有脱离革命洪流。社会主义教育运动中，我和阶级兄弟一起挺身而出，坚决揭露坏人坏事。阶级敌人背后骂我：“身体象破船，嘴巴象铁钳。”我听了不但不泄气，反而斗得更起劲。无产阶级文化大革命中，我正住院治疗。是闭门休养，还是参加战斗？战斗，坚决战斗！我立即回到队里，开会、发言、写文章，对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行口诛笔伐。这样，我虽然行动不得，但是我仍然在阶级斗争的战场上，和广大群众一起驰骋。
    到阶级斗争的大风大浪中去锻炼，是一切革命者成长的道路。在我国，多少革命先烈，多少优秀的共产党员，都是遵循毛主席的这一教导而成长起来的。阶级斗争是锻炼无产阶级革命者的熔炉。在这次伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，就锻炼出一批批红卫兵闯将，锻炼出一批批誓死捍卫毛主席革命路线的无产阶级革命战士。
    我能在毛泽东思想的哺育下，到现实的阶级斗争和群众斗争中去，经风雨，见世面，这是我最大的幸福，最大的进步。我发誓一生一世走这条道路。
    要在大风大浪中锻炼，不要“修身养性”！让唯心主义的“修养”论见鬼去吧！
