Committed to conducting an on-site investigation, the Chinese Embassy in Burma has notified the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to make the necessary arrangements.

	NEW DELHI, July 6 (Xinhua) — YANGON (July 5) — In a note handed to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on July 5, the Chinese Embassy in Burma stated that it has been instructed to begin an on-site investigation from July 6 regarding the Burmese reactionary government's instigation of mobs to kill Chinese nationals, burn and loot their properties, and arbitrarily arrest them.

	The note from the Chinese Embassy said that in the frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese campaign orchestrated by the Burmese reactionary government, countless innocent Chinese nationals were killed and beaten, many Chinese residences and shops were burned down, and a large amount of Chinese property was plundered. Many people were also arbitrarily arrested.

	The Chinese Embassy has repeatedly lodged protests over this matter, demanding that the Burmese government provide a complete list of Chinese nationals who were killed or injured, investigate the losses suffered by Chinese nationals during the mob attacks, and guarantee compensation. However, the Burmese government has so far refused to respond.

	The note pointed out: "Your heinous crimes against the Chinese people and the broad masses of Chinese nationals must be severely punished. Your attempts to evade responsibility and escape are futile.

	"Since you are too cowardly to provide the lists of those harmed or injured, and refuse to account for the losses suffered by Chinese nationals, the Embassy has decided to dispatch consular officials, along with representatives from Chinese community organizations, to conduct on-site investigations at the sites of destruction. For this purpose, the Burmese government must make the necessary arrangements and provide all the necessary facilities."

    缅甸反动政府反华罪责抵赖不了
　　我驻缅使馆奉命要进行现场调查
　　照会缅甸外交部，责令缅甸政府作出安排
    新华社六日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆临时代办肖明五日向缅甸外交部递交的一份照会指出，中国大使馆奉命从六日起，就缅甸反动政府唆使暴徒屠杀华侨，烧毁和抢劫华侨财产，无理逮捕华侨的情况进行现场调查。
    中国大使馆的照会说，在缅甸反动政府一手策划的疯狂反华排华运动中，无数无辜华侨被杀害和毒打，很多华侨住所和商店被烧毁，大量华侨财产被掠夺，很多人无辜被捕。
    中国大使馆曾就此多次提出交涉，严正要求缅甸政府提交遇难和受伤华侨全部名单，查明华侨在暴徒袭击时遭受损失的情况并保证作出赔偿。但至今缅甸政府拒不作出答复。
    照会指出：“你们对中国人民和广大华侨犯下的滔天罪行，必须得到严厉的惩罚，你们企图抵赖和溜掉是办不到的。
      “你们既然畏罪不敢提供被害、被伤名单，对华侨损失不作交代，大使馆决定派出使馆领事官员与华侨侨团代表一道到遭受破坏的现场进行调查。为此，缅甸政府必须作出安排，提供一切便利。”
