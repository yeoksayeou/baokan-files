The Leadership Committee of the Portuguese Marxist-Leninist Committee has sent a congratulatory message to Chairman Mao Zedong on the successful explosion of China's first hydrogen bomb. The full text is as follows:

To the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China, Comrade Mao Zedong:

The explosion of a hydrogen bomb of tremendous power is a great victory for the Chinese people, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the invincible and boundless thought of Mao Zedong.

June 17, 1967, will be forever remembered in the annals of the peoples of all countries who are fighting against imperialism and reactionary forces. Because this day marks the bankruptcy of the nuclear monopoly of the United States and the Soviet Union, it is a great contribution to the struggle of the working class and the peoples of all countries against imperialism headed by U.S. imperialism, and for peace, independence, and socialism.

The imperialists and revisionists, who are panic-stricken by the revolutionary achievements of the Chinese people, are shamelessly plotting conspiracies against the peoples of various countries who are fighting for their liberation. The peoples of various countries are enthusiastically hailing the glorious achievements of the Chinese people.

　　葡萄牙马列主义委员会领导委员会祝贺我氢弹爆炸成功
　　对世界革命人民反帝斗争的伟大贡献
    新华社讯　毛泽东主席收到了葡萄牙马克思列宁主义委员会领导委员会写来的祝贺我国第一颗氢弹爆炸成功的贺信。全文如下：中国共产党中央委员会，毛泽东同志：
    威力极其巨大的一颗氢弹的爆炸，是中国人民、无产阶级文化大革命和光焰无际的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的重大胜利。
    一九六七年六月十七日，将永志不忘地载入正为反对帝国主义和各国反动派而进行斗争的各国人民的史册。因为这一天标志着美苏核垄断的破产，因此，这是对工人阶级和世界各国人民为反对以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义，为争取和平、独立和社会主义所进行的斗争的伟大贡献。
    对中国人民这一革命的非凡成就惊慌失措的帝国主义者和修正主义者，正在无耻地策划阴谋，反对正为自己的解放而斗争的各国人民，而各国人民则热烈地欢呼中国人民的这一光荣成就。
  葡萄牙马克思列宁主义委员会领导委员会
              一九六七年六月十八日
