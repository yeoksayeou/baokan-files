Chairman Mao teaches us: "Imperialism is externally strong but internally weak because it lacks the support of the people." "The internal contradictions within the imperialist system are numerous and insurmountable, plunging the imperialists into great anguish."

British imperialism has recently been making a lot of noise, attempting to show off its "strength" in front of the Chinese and Arab peoples. However, no matter how British imperialism tries to put on a show, it cannot hide its true nature as a paper tiger.

The U.S. Empire's Running Dog

British imperialism has been trying hard to portray itself as a world power, but everyone knows it has long become a destitute, decaying household, a running dog of U.S. imperialism.

After the war, the national liberation movements in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have flourished, and many British colonies have gained political independence, causing this colonial empire to rapidly disintegrate.

British imperialism, in order to maintain its "great power" status, has gone to great lengths to barely maintain its Commonwealth. However, the Commonwealth has also quickly fallen apart. Canada, Australia, and New Zealand have already fallen into the arms of the United States, and India, Guyana, and others are increasingly being controlled by the United States. Other Commonwealth countries are also increasingly distancing themselves from Britain. Last year's Commonwealth Prime Ministers' Conference saw 23 member countries, with one country refusing to participate and nine countries not sending their heads of state or government. This conference, marked by "fierce arguments and deep policy differences," became a "milestone on the downhill road of the Commonwealth."

Now, the "British Empire" has become "Little England," with its international status plummeting. British imperialism now completely relies on U.S. imperialism to act as its running dog, running errands for U.S. imperialism's aggression in Vietnam and encirclement of China, and acting as a broker in "U.S.-Soviet cooperation" to gain a little favor from U.S. imperialism.

The magazine *U.S. News & World Report* says that Britain will either become "a dependent little partner of the United States in the world" or a "small, lonely island nation with almost negligible influence outside its own borders." This is the "wonderful" future that U.S. imperialism has planned for Britain.

Economically, British imperialism is in a state of severe decline.

The parasitic nature of this old imperialist country is well known. Most of its domestic food and industrial raw materials are imported from abroad, and its manufactured goods are mainly sold in foreign markets. Foreign trade is the lifeline of British imperialism's economy. However, the loss of colonies, the United States undermining Britain's position worldwide, and the life-and-death struggle among imperialist countries for global markets have made Britain's foreign trade worse each year, and its economic situation increasingly dire.

British industry is outdated, with high production costs, and is being squeezed out in international trade by the United States, Japan, and Western European countries, with its position continually declining. The difficulties in British exports have led to consecutive trade deficits, which have worsened Britain's balance of payments, causing the pound's credit to greatly shake. Last year, there were five waves of pound selling on the international market.

The British government, in order to protect the pound, has had to frantically raise bank interest rates to attract foreign capital inflows, while implementing economic austerity policies domestically to reduce imports. This will inevitably cause British industry to stagnate for a long time. Last year, the decline in British industrial production was largely due to the austerity policies adopted by the Labour government to protect the pound. In the first three months of this year, although total industrial output has slightly rebounded, production in important sectors such as steel, metal manufacturing, machinery, and textiles has still seen significant declines. A severe economic crisis looms over British imperialism like an impending storm cloud.

Recently, the British government decided to apply again to join the European Common Market, attempting to find a way out in Western Europe, but was rejected by France. This is a clear sign of British imperialism's economic decline and desperation.

"The Suez East" Strategy Fails

Since the end of World War II, Britain's status as a military power has long ended. With the disintegration of the colonial empire and deepening financial and economic difficulties, Britain has had to repeatedly retreat, abandoning a series of strategic strongholds. However, in order to support U.S. imperialism's "global strategy," to assist U.S. imperialism in maintaining the transportation lines from the Middle East to Australia and New Zealand, to suppress national liberation movements in Asia and Africa, and to maintain its remaining colonial interests in the Asia-Africa region, British imperialism adopted the so-called "Suez East" strategy, concentrating its limited military forces in the regions east of the Suez Canal. However, the worsening British financial situation has made this strategy unsustainable.

Last year's British defense white paper openly admitted that Britain is no longer able to "conduct major wars abroad on its own." The "excessive burden" of military spending on the economy, the "overstretched" overseas troops, the lack of strategic reserves at home, and the insufficient supply of troops have forced the Labour government to decide to cut military spending and reduce overseas troops. U.S. newspapers mockingly referred to this white paper as the "epitaph of the British Empire."

At that time, the British government was still struggling to maintain the so-called "Suez East" strategy and to maintain a large garrison in West Germany. However, these two items alone accounted for approximately one-third of Britain's military strength, costing tens of billions of dollars in foreign exchange each year. How could British imperialism afford it? The British government's defense white paper for this year finally had to admit that even this flawed "Suez East" strategy is beyond Britain's capabilities. The white paper announced that Britain will withdraw all its troops from Malaysia and Singapore by the mid-1970s and reduce its troops in West Germany. This is a clear exposure of the rotten nature of the British paper tiger.

Domestic Class Struggles Intensify

As British imperialism continues to decay and decline, class struggles within Britain have become increasingly sharp.

In order to alleviate the economic crisis, in addition to further leaning on U.S. imperialism and begging for loans, the British government has been ruthlessly attacking the working people. Since the Labour government led by Wilson came to power, it has already increased taxes by more than ten billion pounds, equivalent to each British person, regardless of age or gender, having to pay more than twenty pounds in taxes each year. At the same time, prices have soared, and the prices of daily necessities have increased by one-third. British working people are becoming increasingly impoverished. In British cities, both large and small, there are countless homeless people, those who survive by scavenging, and those who beg on the streets.

The British government's actions have met with strong opposition from the broad masses of British working people. Although the British government has imposed laws freezing wages and limiting wage increases on the working people, even threatening to use criminal law against workers who go on strike to defend their living rights, millions of workers have still demanded wage increases. Following the nationwide seamen's strike in May and June last year, workers in various industries in many British cities have been continuously going on strike and demonstrating.

At the same time, the struggle of the British people against the British government's pursuit of U.S. imperialism is also flourishing. In many British cities, demonstrations and marches against U.S. aggression in Vietnam have broken out. On May 7 this year, thousands of British workers, holding high the portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao, held a grand anti-U.S. demonstration and rally. The great thought of Mao Zedong is increasingly penetrating the hearts of the British working class and the working people.

British imperialism is now a hollow, tottering tree, unable to withstand the impact of revolutionary storms at home and abroad. It is now unwise, risking its life, following U.S. imperialism in attempting to provoke the Chinese and Arab peoples, the result of which will surely be to bring upon itself more suffering and hasten its own demise.

### 英帝国主义是纸老虎

    英帝国主义是纸老虎
    毛主席教导我们说：“帝国主义是外强中干的，因为它没有人民的支持。”“帝国主义制度内部的矛盾重重，无法克服，使帝国主义者陷入了极大的苦闷中。”
    英帝国主义最近气势汹汹，妄想在中国人民和阿拉伯人民面前逞“威风”。但是，英帝国主义不管怎样装模作样，都掩盖不住它色厉内荏的纸老虎本质。
    美帝的小伙计
    英帝国主义竭力想把自己装扮成一个世界强国，但是，谁都知道，它早已成了穷愁潦倒的破落户，美帝国主义的小伙计。
    战后亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲民族解放运动蓬勃发展，许多英国殖民地取得了政治独立，使这个殖民帝国迅速瓦解了。
    英帝国主义为了保持自己的“大国地位”，费尽心机勉强维持了它的英联邦。但是英联邦也很快就四分五裂了。加拿大、澳大利亚、新西兰已经投进美国的怀抱，印度、圭亚那等也日益被美国所控制。其它英联邦国家也越来越离开英国。去年的英联邦总理会议，二十三个成员国中，一个国家拒绝参加，九个国家没有派国家或政府首脑出席。这次发生了“激烈的争吵和深刻的政策分歧”的会议，成了英联邦“下坡路上的一块里程碑”。
    现在，“大英帝国”已经成了“小英格兰”，国际地位一落千丈。英帝国主义现在完全依靠美帝国主义充当小伙计，为美帝国主义侵略越南、包围中国奔走效劳，在“美苏合作”中间充当掮客，来换取美帝国主义对它的一点照顾。
    《美国新闻与世界报道》杂志就说，英国要不是“变成美国在世界上的一个仰人鼻息的小伙伴”，就是成为一个“在本国疆域以外的影响几乎微不足道”的“一个小小的、孤零零的岛国”。这就是美帝国主义为英国安排下的“美妙”前途。
    经济上百孔千疮
    经济上的捉襟见肘是英帝国主义的最致命弱点。
    英国这个老牌帝国主义国家的寄生性是人所共知的。国内食物和工业原料绝大部分靠国外进口，制成品也主要靠国外市场销售。对外贸易是英帝国主义经济的生命线。但是，殖民地的丧失，美国在全世界到处挖英国的墙脚，帝国主义国家之间争夺世界市场的你死我活的斗争，使得英国在对外贸易上一年不如一年，经济情况越来越恶化。
    英国工业设备陈旧，生产成本高，在国际贸易上受到美国、日本和西欧大陆国家的排挤，地位不断下降。英国出口的困难，造成连年的贸易赤字。这就加重了英国的国际收支逆差，从而使英镑信用大大动摇。去年一年，在国际市场上发生了五次抛售英镑的风潮。
    英国政府为了保护英镑，不得不拚命提高银行利率，吸收外国资金流入，同时在国内实行经济紧缩政策，以减少进口。这就必然使英国工业陷于长期停滞状态。去年英国工业生产的下降，在很大程度上就是同工党政府采取的保护英镑的紧缩政策有关。今年头三个月，工业总产量虽略有回升，但钢、五金制造、机器、纺织等重要部门的生产仍有大幅度下降。一场严重的经济危机象压城欲摧的黑云一样，笼罩在英帝国主义头上。
    最近英国政府决定再次申请参加欧洲共同市场，企图在西欧寻找一条生路，但是又遭到了法国的拒绝。这正是英帝国主义在经济上日暮途穷，走投无路的表现。
    “苏伊士以东”战略破产
    二次大战以后，英国作为一个军事大国的地位，早已结束了。随着殖民帝国的瓦解和财政经济困难的加深，英国在军事上不得不一再收缩，撤出一系列的战略据点。但是英帝国主义为了支持美帝国主义的“全球战略”，配合美帝国主义维持从中东到澳大利亚、新西兰的交通线，镇压亚洲、非洲的民族解放运动，维护它在亚非地区残存的殖民利益，采取了所谓“苏伊士以东”的战略，把有限的军事力量重点放在苏伊士运河以东的地区。可是，日益恶化的英国财政状况，使这个战略也维持不下去了。
    去年公布的英国国防白皮书，公开招认英国已无力在国外单独“从事重大的战争行动”。军事给财政经济造成的“过重的负担”，海外驻军“铺得太开”而疲于奔命，国内战略后备的缺乏，兵员补充的不足，迫使工党政府作出了削减军事开支和收缩海外驻军的决定。美国报纸挖苦地把这个白皮书称作是“大英帝国的墓志铭”。
    当时英国政府还挣扎着企图维持所谓“苏伊士以东”战略，并保持在西德的庞大驻军。但是单这两项就占了大约三分之一的英国军事力量，每年耗费外汇十几亿美元。英帝国主义哪里还吃得消？英国政府刚发表的今年的国防白皮书终于不得不承认，即使这个抱残守缺的“苏伊士以东”战略也是英国力所不逮的。白皮书宣布，英国将在七十年代中期以前全部撤回在马来亚和新加坡的驻军，并要减少驻西德的军队。这是腐朽的英国纸老虎原形的大暴露。
    国内阶级矛盾日益尖锐
    随着英帝国主义的日益腐朽衰落，英国国内的阶级矛盾也越来越尖锐了。
    英国政府为了缓和经济上的危机，除了进一步向美帝国主义投靠，乞讨借债以外，疯狂地向劳动人民开刀。自从威尔逊的工党政府上台以来，已经陆续增加了十多亿英镑的税收，等于每个英国人，不分男女老少，每年要比过去多缴二十镑以上的税。同时物价飞涨，生活必需品的价格上涨了三分之一。英国劳动人民越来越贫困。在英国的大小城市里，无家可归的、靠捡破烂糊口的、沿街行乞的人到处都是。
    英国政府的这种做法，遭到了英国广大劳动人民的强烈反对。虽然英国政府把冻结工资和限制增加工资的法律强加在劳动人民身上，甚至威胁要用刑法来对付为保卫生活权利而罢工的工人，数百万工人还是纷纷提出增加工资的要求。继去年五、六月间英国全国海员大罢工以后，英国许多城市里各行各业的工人不断举行罢工和示威。
    同时，英国人民反对英国政府追随美帝国主义的斗争，也在蓬勃发展。在许多英国城市里爆发了反对美国侵略越南的示威游行。今年五月七日，数千名英国工人高举着全世界人民伟大导师毛主席的画像，举行了浩浩荡荡的反美示威和集会。伟大的毛泽东思想正在日益深入到英国工人阶级和劳动人民心里。
    英帝国主义已经是一棵蛀空了心的摇摇欲倒的枯树，再也经不起国内和国际上的革命风暴的冲击。它现在不识时务，拚着老命，跟着美帝国主义妄图向中国人民和阿拉伯人民疯狂进行挑衅，其结果必将是自讨苦吃，使它的灭亡更快到来。
