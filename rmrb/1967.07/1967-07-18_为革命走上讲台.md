I am an old teacher who has been teaching for twenty-five years, and my mind is filled with many outdated ideas. When military training began, the PLA comrades mobilized me to teach political classes, but I was afraid of making mistakes, so I politely declined.

During the military training, I sat with the students to learn. The political classes were taught by PLA soldiers in their twenties. They taught very vividly.

Why were the young PLA soldiers, who had limited cultural knowledge and teaching experience, so bold to step onto the lectern to teach? During the military training, I gradually understood that the PLA comrades taught based on their own experiences and insights from studying Chairman Mao's works. They did not see themselves as teachers but as students of the students. They boldly shared their thoughts and asked revolutionary teachers and students to criticize and help improve their teaching content. They prepared lessons with the students, and when they encountered problems, they studied them together with the students.

The actions of the PLA comrades embodied Chairman Mao's thoughts on being humble and serving the people. From the actions of the PLA comrades, I realized that not daring to teach or take charge was actually due to not being able to put down the attitude of being a teacher and not truly achieving what Chairman Mao said, "First be a student of the masses, then be a teacher of the masses."

Under the influence and guidance of the PLA, I returned to the lectern and resumed classes to make the revolution with the students. I shared with the students my insights from studying Chairman Mao's works, openly shared my thoughts, and improved my understanding together with the students. This way, not only did I not lose my authority, but I also became even closer to the students.

Beijing No. 27 Middle School   An Old Teacher

Editor's Note:

Establishing a new type of revolutionary teacher-student relationship is an important condition for successfully carrying out the "class suspended, make revolution" movement.

Creating this condition requires not only the efforts of revolutionary students but also the efforts of revolutionary teachers. This old teacher, who has been on the lectern for twenty-five years, returning to the lectern is a good example.

To achieve this is not difficult. The old teacher's experience is that first, change the "fear" to "dare." This means putting down the attitude of being a teacher in one's mind, first being a student of the masses, deeply entering the students, learning from the revolutionary youngsters, and blending in with the students. With one's revolutionary thoughts and actions, gain the trust and support of the students. In this way, a new type of revolutionary teacher-student relationship can gradually be formed.

### 为革命走上讲台

    为革命走上讲台
    我是个已经教了二十五年学的老教师，脑子里装了许多旧东西。军训开始，解放军同志动员我讲政治课时，我怕讲错话，便婉言拒绝了。
    军训中，我和同学们坐在一起学习。给我们讲政治课的都是二十多岁的解放军战士。他们讲得非常生动。
    为什么解放军战士那么年青，文化水平也不高，教学经验也缺乏，就敢登上讲台讲课呢？在军训中，我渐渐理解到，解放军同志讲的都是自己活学活用毛主席著作的经验和体会。他们不是把自己当成先生，而是把自己当成学生的学生。他们大胆亮思想，要求革命师生对他们的思想认识和讲课内容提出批评和帮助。他们和同学们共同备课，遇到问题，找同学们共同研究。
    解放军同志的行动，体现了毛主席关于谦虚谨慎、为人民服务的思想。从解放军同志的行动中，我觉悟到，不敢讲课，不管事，实际上是放不下当先生的架子，没有真正做到毛主席所说的“先做群众的学生，再做群众的先生”。
    在解放军的影响和带动下，我重新登上了讲台，和同学们一起复课闹革命。我给同学们讲自己学习毛主席著作的心得体会，亮自己的活思想，和同学们一起提高认识。这样一来，不仅没有降低威信，反而更加密切了我和同学们的关系。

    建立新型的革命的师生关系，是当前搞好复课闹革命的一个重要条件。
    创造这个条件，不仅要靠革命学生的努力，还要靠革命教师自己的努力。这位站了二十五年讲台的老教师重新走上讲台，就是很好的例子。
    要做到这一点并不难。这位老教师的体会是，首先把“怕”字换成“敢”字。这就是要从思想上放下当先生的架子，先做群众的学生，深入到学生中去，向革命小将学习，和学生打成一片，以自己的革命的思想和行动，取得学生信任和支持。这样，新型的革命的师生关系就能逐步形成。
