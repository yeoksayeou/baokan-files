The Albanian People's Assembly held its third session in Tirana from July 18 to 19. Albanian Foreign Minister Nasi delivered a report titled "On the International Situation and the Foreign Policy of the People's Republic of Albania."

In his report, Nasi analyzed the situation of the revolutionary armed struggles of the people of various countries, denouncing the collusion between U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership in suppressing the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. He condemned the anti-China provocations by the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists and enthusiastically praised the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and China's successful detonation of the first hydrogen bomb.

He emphasized that today, the U.S. imperialists are increasingly bringing the war closer to the People's Republic of China and have established a series of military bases equipped with nuclear weapons around China. The Brezhnev-Kosygin clique, serving the U.S. imperialists, continues to provoke China unremittingly. The anti-revolutionary alliance of the U.S. and the Soviet Union is primarily aimed at China because China is the greatest obstacle to the U.S.-Soviet plan to dominate the world. However, the great People's China has become an invincible fortress and an indestructible bastion of socialism in Asia and the world. Both U.S. imperialism and the Khrushchev revisionists will be smashed to pieces on this fortress.

Nasi said that the brilliant victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which began a year ago, is a victory of the Marxist-Leninist thought of Comrade Mao Zedong. This brilliant victory marks a new historical stage for China and the world's socialism and revolution. This irresistible great movement, involving hundreds of millions of Chinese people, has smashed the attempts of domestic and foreign enemies to restore capitalism in China and has further consolidated the dictatorship of the proletariat.

He said that the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists are viciously slandering, defaming, and attacking the People's Republic of China and its Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution because they are terrified of the immense power of the Chinese people, which is increasingly demonstrated through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They are also afraid of the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries, who regard China as their main reliance in realizing their aspirations.

He said that the imperialists and revisionists are desperately trying to seize this fortress from within through a small group of traitors, to lead China onto the capitalist road, and to completely destroy the socialist achievements of this great country. These evil plans have been smashed, and their illusions have been shattered because the Chinese people, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, have resolved to defend socialism and Marxism-Leninism at all costs.

Nasi pointed out that China's brilliant victory in successfully detonating the first hydrogen bomb on June 17 is a great encouragement to all progressive humanity, a glorious victory of the proletarian revolutionary line of the glorious Communist Party of China and the thought of the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. This victory not only proves that China's science and technology have reached a high level but also proves the strengthening of China's defensive capabilities, the boundless creativity and extraordinary abilities of the 700 million Chinese people, and the revolutionary China's unyielding march towards the brilliant peaks of socialism and communism. This victory is also a heavy blow to the nuclear blackmail of imperialism and revisionism, greatly dampening the arrogance of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries of various countries, and making an immeasurable contribution to the struggle of the people of the world for freedom and national independence.

Nasi strongly condemned the betrayal of the Soviet revisionist clique against the revolutionary struggles of the people of various countries. He said that the struggle against U.S. imperialism cannot be separated from the struggle against the Khrushchev revisionists. Now, this struggle has become the highest duty of the people and revolutionary forces of all countries. Currently, the people of various countries are waging heroic struggles against U.S. imperialism and its accomplices for freedom, national independence, and social progress. The anti-imperialist movement of the revolutionary people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America has been widely launched. The people of various countries are increasingly convinced that armed struggle is the only correct path to victory.

Nasi said that the armed struggle of the heroic Vietnamese people has dealt a heavy blow to the U.S. aggressors. The world-renowned people's war waged by the courageous Vietnamese people has become a great source of inspiration for the people of all countries in the world. The Vietnamese people have shown the world the weakness of imperialism led by U.S. imperialism and have shown that the Vietnamese people not only can deal with the imperialist aggressors and their accomplices but also have the courage and confidence to defeat the enemy and achieve victory.

He said that the Soviet revisionist leadership is playing the shameful role of a fire brigade to extinguish the flames of national liberation struggles, doing everything possible to help U.S. imperialism escape its inevitable failure in Vietnam. To achieve this goal, the Soviet revisionist leadership is using every means to force the Vietnamese people to "negotiate" with Johnson and to give up halfway and surrender to the U.S. aggressors. We are fully convinced that the heroic Vietnamese people will not be deceived by the conspiracy of the imperialist-revisionist alliance and will give a proper response to the enemies of their country's freedom and independence. They will continue to fight resolutely to defend the north, liberate the south, and reunify the country.

In discussing recent events in the Middle East, Nasi emphasized that the Middle East events have shown the people who love freedom that the Soviet revisionists are accomplices of U.S. imperialism, helping the U.S. implement its policy of aggression and always ready to betray the vital interests of any country's people for the sake of the holy alliance of the U.S. and the Soviet Union. The Middle East events have exposed the conspiracy of the U.S. and the Soviet Union to oppose the freedom and independence of the Arab countries, which is a great danger to the freedom and peace of the people of various countries. A resolute struggle must be waged to expose and smash the U.S.-Soviet alliance.

Nasi said that the people of the world will draw the necessary conclusions from the recent Middle East events. The people of the United Arab Republic, the Syrian Arab Republic, Jordan, and other Arab countries have encountered similar situations. The people of these countries should correctly distinguish between their false friends and true friends, their enemies, and draw a clear line with these enemies, and be vigilant against the enemy's aggression and conspiracy activities.

Nasi said that in the resolute struggle of the brotherly Arab people to maintain their freedom and national independence, the Albanian people are now and will always stand side by side with the brotherly Arab people. We are deeply convinced that the just cause of the Arab people will ultimately triumph.

The meeting discussed Nasi's report and unanimously passed a resolution fully supporting the foreign policy of the Albanian government.

This session also discussed and unanimously passed laws on resident income tax and agricultural tax, and approved several decrees issued by the Presidium of the People's Assembly since the last session of the People's Assembly.

Albanian party and state leaders Shehu, List, Charcani, Balluku, Nushi, Kaba, and others attended this meeting. Diplomatic envoys from several countries to Albania were also invited to attend the opening ceremony of the meeting.

    阿尔巴尼亚人民议会举行第三次会议
    一致通过决议完全赞同政府的外交政策
    纳赛外长作报告热烈赞扬中国文化大革命，谴责苏修勾结美帝镇压各国人民革命斗争
    新华社地拉那十九日电　阿尔巴尼亚第六届人民议会于十八日到十九日在地拉那举行了第三次会议。阿尔巴尼亚外交部长纳赛在会上作了“关于国际形势和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国政府的外交政策”的报告。
    纳赛在报告中分析了世界各国人民革命武装斗争日益发展的形势，谴责美帝国主义同苏联修正主义领导集团互相勾结镇压世界人民的革命斗争；他谴责了美帝和苏修的反华挑衅，热情赞扬了中国的无产阶级文化大革命和中国成功地爆炸了第一颗氢弹的辉煌成就。
    他强调指出，今天美帝国主义者把战火越来越烧近中华人民共和国，并在中国周围建立了一系列配备原子武器的军事基地。勃列日涅夫—柯西金集团为美帝效劳，继续不断地对中国进行挑衅。美—苏反革命联盟的矛头，首先指向中国，因为中国是美帝和苏修的美苏两国主宰世界的计划的最大障碍。但是，伟大的人民中国已成为不可战胜的堡垒，已成为亚洲和全世界社会主义的不可摧毁的堡垒，美帝国主义和赫鲁晓夫修正主义都将在这个堡垒上碰得粉身碎骨。
    纳赛说，一年以前开始的中国无产阶级文化大革命的光辉胜利，是毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想的胜利。对于中国和全世界社会主义和革命的命运来说，这一辉煌胜利标志着一个新的历史阶段。有亿万中国人民参加的这个势不可挡的伟大运动，粉碎了国内外敌人要在中国复辟资本主义的企图，进一步巩固了无产阶级专政。
    他说，美帝和苏修大肆诽谤、诋毁和攻击中华人民共和国和她的无产阶级文化大革命，这是因为它们对中国人民的威力无比的巨大力量怕得要死，中国人民的这种威力日益通过无产阶级文化大革命显示出来。他们也害怕世界各国人民的革命斗争，世界各国人民把中国看作是他们争取实现自己的愿望的主要依靠。
    他说，帝国主义者和修正主义者枉费心机地拚命通过一小撮叛徒来企图从内部夺取这个堡垒，把中国引到资本主义道路上去，以便彻底摧毁这个伟大国家的社会主义成果。这些恶毒的计划已被粉碎，他们的妄想已经落空，因为在毛泽东思想指引下的中国人民，已下定决心不惜付出一切代价来保卫社会主义和马克思列宁主义。
    纳赛指出，中国在今年六月十七日成功地爆炸了第一颗氢弹的辉煌胜利，是对整个进步人类的巨大鼓舞，是光荣的中国共产党的无产阶级革命路线和中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志的思想的光辉胜利。这一胜利不仅证明了中国科学技术已经达到了高度的水平，而且证明了中国防御力量的增强，证明了七亿中国人民具有无穷无尽的创造力和非凡的才能，证明了革命的伟大中国，将一往无前地攀登社会主义和共产主义的光辉灿烂的顶峰。这一胜利也是对帝国主义和修正主义的原子讹诈的沉重打击，大灭帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的嚣张气焰，从而对全世界人民争取自由和民族独立的斗争作出了无可估量的贡献。
    纳赛强烈谴责苏修集团对各国人民革命斗争的叛卖行径。他说，反对美帝国主义的斗争决不能同反对赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的斗争分隔开来，现在，这一斗争已经成为世界各国人民和革命力量的最崇高的义务。目前，各国人民正在进行反对美帝及其帮凶，争取自由、民族独立和社会进步的英勇斗争。亚非拉各国革命人民声势浩大的反帝运动已经广泛开展。各国人民日益深信武装斗争是取得胜利的唯一正确的途径。
    纳赛说，英雄的越南人民的武装斗争给予美国侵略者以沉重的打击。英勇的越南人民进行的举世闻名的人民战争，已成为全世界各国人民取得巨大鼓舞力量的源泉。越南人民向世界各国人民指出了以美帝国主义为首的帝国主义的虚弱性，指出了越南人民不仅能对付帝国主义侵略者及其帮凶，而且有勇气和坚信他们能打败敌人和取得胜利。
    他说，苏修领导集团充当扑灭民族解放斗争的消防队的可耻角色，竭力帮助美帝国主义摆脱它在越南的不可避免的失败。为了达到这个目的，苏修领导集团千方百计企图迫使越南人民同约翰逊“和谈”，迫使越南人民半途而废并向美国侵略者投降。我们完全深信，英雄的越南人民决不会被帝国主义—修正主义合伙搞的阴谋所蒙骗，并将对本国自由和独立的敌人进行应有的还击。为保卫北方、解放南方和统一祖国而进行坚决的斗争。
    在谈到最近的中东事件时纳赛强调指出，中东事件向爱好自由的各国人民表明，苏联修正主义者是美帝国主义的帮凶，他们帮助美帝实现它的侵略政策，并且随时准备为了苏美神圣同盟而背叛任何一国人民的切身利益。中东事件暴露了美苏勾结一起阴谋反对阿拉伯各国人民的自由和独立，这种勾结是对各国人民的自由与和平事业的巨大危险。必须进行坚决的斗争来揭露和粉碎苏美同盟。
    纳赛说，世界各国人民将会从最近中东事件中得出必要的结论。阿拉伯联合共和国，阿拉伯叙利亚共和国，约旦和其他阿拉伯国家的人民所遇到的事，其他国家的人民也可能遇到。这些国家的人民应该正确地分清谁是他们的假朋友、谁是他们的真朋友、谁是他们的敌人，并同这些敌人划清界线，警惕敌人的侵略和阴谋活动。
    纳赛说，在兄弟的阿拉伯各国人民为维护自己的自由和民族独立而进行的坚决的斗争中，阿尔巴尼亚人民现在和将来永远同兄弟的阿拉伯各国人民携手战斗。我们深信，阿拉伯各国人民的正义事业将取得最后的胜利。
    会议讨论了纳赛的报告，并一致通过决议，完全赞同阿尔巴尼亚政府的外交政策。
    这次会议还讨论和一致通过了关于居民所得税和农业税的法律，批准了人民议会主席团从人民议会上次会议以来所宣布的一些法令。
    阿尔巴尼亚党和国家领导人谢胡、列希、查尔查尼、巴卢库、努什、卡博等出席了这次会议。一些国家驻阿尔巴尼亚的外交使节也应邀出席了会议开幕式。
