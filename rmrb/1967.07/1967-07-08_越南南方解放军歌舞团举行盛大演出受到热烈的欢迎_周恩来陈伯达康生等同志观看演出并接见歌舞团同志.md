The Vietnamese Southern Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe, coming from the front lines of the anti-American struggle, held a grand performance at the Great Hall of the People this evening, which was warmly welcomed.

Tonight, the Great Hall of the People was filled with the fervent atmosphere of revolutionary friendship and combat unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam. On the stage, there was a large banner with the words of our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao: "The Chinese people regard the victories of the anti-imperialist struggles of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America as their own victories, and give enthusiastic support and sympathy to all their anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist struggles." A huge banner read: "The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought stand firmly with the Vietnamese people and give all-out support to the Vietnamese people's anti-American national salvation war, and thoroughly defeat the American aggressors."

The Vietnamese Southern cultural warriors first sang "Liberate the South" and "The East is Red." Their performances included songs and dances reflecting the heroic deeds of the Vietnamese Southern military and people in their struggle against the Americans, the folk song "The Forest of Bac Pho" praising the leadership of the Vietnamese people's beloved leader Ho Chi Minh in the revolutionary struggle, and songs praising the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam.

The comrades from Southern Vietnam also sang in Chinese the song "Long Live Chairman Mao," praising the great leader of the Chinese people, and played Chinese revolutionary songs such as "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" and "On the Golden Mountain in Beijing" using Vietnamese national instruments.

The performances by the Vietnamese cultural warriors were warmly welcomed. Many performances were encored four or five times.

During the intermission, Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, and others met with the troupe leader Nguyen Xuan Hung and other leaders and performers of the song and dance troupe, and had a cordial conversation.
