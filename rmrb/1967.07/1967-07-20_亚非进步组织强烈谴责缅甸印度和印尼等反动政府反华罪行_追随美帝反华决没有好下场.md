	Asia and Africa progressive organizations strongly condemn the anti-China crimes committed by the reactionary governments of Burma, India, and Indonesia. They point out that following the U.S. imperialism in opposing China will lead to no good end.

	New China News Agency, July 19th: Some progressive organizations in Asia and Africa have strongly condemned the anti-China crimes committed by the reactionary governments of Burma, India, and Indonesia. They pointed out that following U.S. imperialism in opposing China will lead to no good end.

	The Secretary-General of the Palestinian Trade Union Federation, Kufash, said in Cairo on the 18th to the New China News Agency reporter: "We Palestinian workers resolutely condemn the recent fascist crimes committed by the Burmese reactionary government of Ne Win in collusion with U.S. imperialism and its accomplices against China."

	Kufash said: "The Ne Win reactionary regime follows the U.S. in opposing socialist China, which will only hasten its own doom."

	During the conversation, Kufash asked the reporter for a badge of Chairman Mao, then pinned it on his shirt. He said: "The Ne Win reactionary government fears the great Mao Zedong Thought, while we revolutionary people love Chairman Mao. The attempt by imperialism and its followers to stop the spread of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought will never succeed. We believe that the final victory will belong to the revolutionary people of the world and the revolutionary forces of Burma."

	Kufash said: "Based on our long-term experience, we Palestinian workers and people clearly know that China is our true friend. The Chinese government and people, under the guidance of the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, have consistently and resolutely supported the struggle of the world's revolutionary people against U.S.-led imperialism. Whoever pursues an anti-China policy stands with U.S. imperialism and becomes an enemy of the world's revolutionary people."

	The Secretary-General of the Arab Lawyers Union, Ashida, told the New China News Agency reporter: "Just as U.S. imperialism is intensifying its aggression against Vietnam and Arab countries, the Burmese reactionary government has committed anti-China crimes. This clearly shows that the Ne Win government is acting entirely according to the instructions of U.S. imperialism. Recently, U.S. imperialism has attempted to launch a worldwide anti-China, anti-people movement to divert the world's people's attention from condemning its crimes in the Middle East and Vietnam. However, the plots of U.S. imperialism will not succeed. Because the people of Asia and Africa know who their enemies and friends are."

	Ashida said: "We Arab lawyers resolutely condemn the reactionary anti-China activities of the Ne Win government. We call on the Burmese people to overthrow this reactionary government. We believe that the Burmese people will defeat the plots of U.S. imperialism. No force in the world can destroy the fighting unity of the Asian and African peoples with China against U.S.-led imperialism."

	Recently, Somali progressive writer Muhammad Dahhan said in Mogadishu to the New China News Agency reporter: "The recent provocations and attacks on China by the reactionary governments of Burma, Indonesia, and India are because, under the leadership of Mao Zedong, China is the bastion of world revolution." He continued: "But as Chairman Mao said: 'Make trouble, fail, make trouble again, fail again... until they are wiped out—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in their dealings with the people's cause; they are doomed to such a future. This is a Marxist law.'"

	He said: "The revolutionary forces in Burma, Indonesia, and India believe in Mao Zedong Thought. They have enough strength to counterattack the reactionaries supported by imperialism and revisionism and achieve victory. The friendship between the peoples of these countries and the Chinese people, forged in the common struggle, will continue to grow."

    亚非进步组织强烈谴责缅甸印度和印尼等反动政府反华罪行
    追随美帝反华决没有好下场
    新华社十九日讯　亚非一些进步组织负责人强烈谴责缅甸、印度、印度尼西亚等反动政府反华罪行，他们指出，追随美帝国主义反华决没有好下场。
    巴勒斯坦工会联合会秘书长库法什十八日在开罗对新华社记者说：“我们巴勒斯坦工人坚决谴责缅甸奈温反动政府最近勾结美帝国主义和它的帮凶犯下的反华法西斯罪行。”
    库法什说：“奈温反动政权追随美国反对社会主义的中国，决没有好下场，只会加速自己的灭亡。”
    在谈话时，库法什向记者索取了毛主席像章，然后别在自己的衬衣上。他说：“奈温反动政府害怕伟大的毛泽东思想，而我们革命人民热爱毛主席。帝国主义及其追随者阻止传播战无不胜的毛泽东思想的企图是决不会得逞的。我们相信，最后胜利必定属于世界革命人民和缅甸的革命力量。”
    库法什说：“根据我们的长期经验，我们巴勒斯坦工人和人民清楚地知道，中国是我们真正的朋友。中国政府和人民在光焰无际的毛泽东思想的指引下，一贯坚决支持世界革命人民反对以美国为首的帝国主义的斗争。谁奉行反华政策，谁就同美帝国主义站在一起，使自己成为世界革命人民的敌人”。
    阿拉伯律师联合会秘书长阿希达特对新华社记者说：“正当美帝国主义加紧侵略越南和阿拉伯国家的时候，缅甸反动政府犯下了反华罪行。这清楚地表明，奈温政府是完全按美帝国主义的指示行事的。最近，美帝国主义企图掀起世界规模的反华、反人民运动，以便转移世界人民谴责它在中东和越南罪行的注意力。但是，美帝国主义的阴谋决不会得逞。因为亚非人民知道，谁是他们的敌人，谁是他们的朋友。”
    阿希达特说：“我们阿拉伯律师坚决谴责奈温政府反动的反华活动。我们呼吁缅甸人民推翻这个反动政府。我们相信，缅甸人民将击败美帝国主义的阴谋。世界上没有任何力量能够破坏亚非人民同中国的反对以美国为首的帝国主义的战斗的团结。”
    索马里海岸进步作家穆罕默德·达汉最近在摩加迪沙对新华社记者发表谈话说，中国最近所以遭到缅甸、印尼和印度反动政府的挑衅和攻击，是因为在毛泽东的领导下，中国是世界革命的堡垒。他接着说：“但是，正象毛主席所说的：‘捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。这是一条马克思主义的定律。’”
    他说：“缅甸、印尼和印度的革命力量信仰毛泽东思想，他们有足够的力量反击得到帝国主义和修正主义支持的反动派，取得胜利。这些国家的人民和中国人民之间在共同斗争中锻炼成长的友谊，将日益发展。”
