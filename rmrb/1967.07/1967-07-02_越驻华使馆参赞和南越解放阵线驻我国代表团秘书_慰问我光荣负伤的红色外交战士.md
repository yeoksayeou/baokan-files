	NEW DELHI, July 1 (Xinhua) — On July 1, the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's Ambassador to China, Nguyen Quang Huy, and the Secretary of the Vietnamese National Liberation Front's Permanent Delegation to China, Le Kim, visited the hospital to console the injured Chinese diplomats Chen Luzhi, Zhang Deliang, Li Zhaoqian, Shen Ganbei, Hong Chuanjia, Liu Zhongfu, Wang Liren, and Li Siheng. These diplomats were injured by mobs incited by the Indian reactionary government.

	Nguyen Quang Huy and Le Kim, on behalf of the Vietnamese Embassy in China and the Permanent Delegation of the Vietnamese National Liberation Front to China, expressed fraternal and warm regards to Chen Luzhi and the others. They praised the courageous fighting spirit of the injured diplomats and wished them a speedy recovery. Chen Luzhi and the others expressed their gratitude for the concern shown by the Vietnamese comrades. They stated that the Indian reactionaries and American imperialists are paper tigers. The heroic Vietnamese people have already driven American imperialism into a corner, and the revolutionary people of India will certainly overthrow the Indian reactionaries.
