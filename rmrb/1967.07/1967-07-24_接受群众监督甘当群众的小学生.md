Since we proletarian revolutionaries have taken power, the question of whether we will maintain a modest and prudent style, closely unite with the masses, or become arrogant and detached from the masses, acting like officials and lords, is a new and severe test. It is a major issue concerning whether we can carry the Cultural Revolution through to the end and whether we can maintain our proletarian character.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant." Over the past year of the Cultural Revolution, we have deeply felt that the question of correctly handling relations with the masses is a fundamental issue of Mao Zedong Thought, and it is the dividing line between the revolutionary line of the proletariat represented by Chairman Mao and the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie. The facts have proven: wherever the masses are fully trusted and relied upon, the movement is conducted in a vigorous and lively manner, advancing victoriously along the correct path indicated by Chairman Mao. Otherwise, the movement will be cold and lifeless, lacking in vitality, and may even go astray.

In April this year, our school began preparing to establish a revolutionary committee. Prior to this, the "three-in-one combination" preparatory group did a great deal of work, exposing class struggle within the cadre ranks, using class criteria to differentiate among cadres, and conducting extensive investigations and research on the objects of combination. On this basis, an initial list of the "three-in-one combination" was proposed. We thought this list was authoritative. However, when this list was presented to the masses, many opinions were raised, and sharp criticism was directed at the issue of whether our work had adhered to the mass line. In response to these circumstances, the leadership core convened a meeting for study. Comrade Tan Houlan, a leader of the revolutionary organization, accepted the masses' opinions and delivered a mobilization speech to the entire school, explaining the great significance of Chairman Mao's "three-in-one combination" policy and proposing several opinions on the establishment of a temporary power organ of the "three-in-one combination." After the meeting, we fully mobilized the masses to engage in extensive debate. The facts have proven that once the masses are mobilized, they can grasp Chairman Mao's cadre policy, use the three criteria proposed by Vice Chairman Lin Biao to assess cadres, and clearly distinguish among them. As a result, in a very short time, the revolutionary "three-in-one combination" was achieved, and the school revolutionary committee was established. Most departments also established their own revolutionary committees.

Recently, our revolutionary teachers and students have enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's great call, resumed classes, and carried out the revolution. On this basis, we have launched a major exposure, criticism, and struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party. We have learned from past experiences and have not adopted the practice of a few people formulating plans. Instead, we have fully mobilized the masses, organizing everyone to seriously study Chairman Mao's relevant instructions. At the same time, we have also studied the relevant decisions and reports of the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, deeply understanding the great significance of launching a major criticism movement. Regarding some issues among the students, such as how to combine the major criticism with the struggle, criticism, and reform within the unit, whether to focus on the educational revolution to carry out the major criticism movement, and how to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works in the major criticism, we have conducted extensive debates. The entire school and various departments and classes have held study sessions, discussion meetings, and debate meetings. Many classes have proposed plans and schemes for the major criticism. The school revolutionary committee has concentrated the wisdom of the masses, absorbed the advantages of various schemes, and formulated a plan for the major criticism of the entire school. Currently, a new high tide of major criticism and struggle, criticism, and reform is forming across the school.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "All our cadres, regardless of their rank, are servants of the people," and "serve the people wholeheartedly, never leaving the masses." We follow Chairman Mao's teachings, always paying attention to listening to the masses' opinions, whether they are correct or incorrect, especially paying attention to listening to opinions different from our own. Therefore, a democratic atmosphere has been created throughout the school where the masses dare to criticize and supervise cadres and dare to express different opinions. Whenever a new task is proposed, the masses eagerly offer suggestions. Whenever our work produces shortcomings and errors, the masses bravely point them out with a "speak without reservation" attitude. We analyze the masses' opinions, and for those that are correct, we firmly accept and immediately implement them; for those that are incorrect, we listen humbly. Some criticisms are very sharp, but the opinions themselves are correct, and we have accepted them well. For example, some members of the revolutionary committee have long been detached from the masses, gradually developing an "official" mentality. The masses posted a big-character poster saying, "Do not overthrow the lord to become a young master." Although the problem was raised sharply, it hit the nail on the head. The standing committee of the revolutionary committee immediately convened a meeting to conduct criticism and self-criticism. Everyone recognized the seriousness of the problem, and some comrades immediately posted big-character posters to conduct self-criticism. Under the supervision of the masses, the work of the revolutionary committee has improved significantly.

We have learned from the experience of the People's Liberation Army in conducting training between campaigns, mobilizing the masses to summarize and inspect the work of the previous stage, providing feedback on the leadership's work, and helping leadership cadres to rectify their thoughts and work style. After we took power, we conducted three rectification campaigns, all of which achieved good results. At the beginning, some comrades had reservations, fearing that those who opposed us would take the opportunity to overthrow us, and therefore did not dare to fully mobilize the masses and lacked determination. With the help of the stationed PLA, we unified our thinking and decided to conduct an open rectification. The broad masses fully affirmed that our direction of struggle is correct and affirmed our achievements, while also proposing a large number of criticisms and suggestions regarding the shortcomings in our work. The facts have proven that we were not only not overthrown but became stronger with each rectification, and our relationship with the masses became closer, making us more combat-ready. Especially in the recent rectification, we were deeply educated. After the publication of the "Several Regulations on Seriously Transforming the Style of Work by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee," we seized this good opportunity to fully mobilize the masses to help us conduct rectification. The broad masses sharply criticized the leadership's work for not emphasizing politics, not closely following the spirit of Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee's instructions, and certain issues of extravagance and waste. Many big-character posters pointed out that after we took power, there were "five less and five more": less study of Chairman Mao's works, less participation in mass activities, fewer big-character posters, less participation in productive labor, and less revolutionary spirit; more arrogance and self-satisfaction, more busy administrative work, more time in the office, more meetings, and more officialdom. These problems collectively indicate that after we took power, with the change in status, our thoughts have changed. We have forgotten Chairman Mao's warning to us: "Because of victory, arrogance within the party, the attitude of considering oneself a hero, the attitude of stagnation and not seeking progress, the attitude of enjoying pleasure and not wanting to live a hard life, may grow." Now, as we study Chairman Mao's teachings again, we feel especially close to them. This rectification has made our minds clearer, making us realize that this is a reflection of class struggle within our revolutionary ranks, an attack and infiltration by the bourgeois sugar-coated bullets. Everyone realized that seizing power is only the beginning of the struggle, and using power well will be even more arduous. We are determined to strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, seriously listen to the masses' opinions, and resolutely fight against various petty-bourgeois thoughts in our minds.

As the rectification movement deepens, we carry forward the spirit of the proletarian revolutionaries who say what they do, resolutely acting according to Chairman Mao's instructions. In the early days of the revolutionary committee's establishment, due to the needs of the struggle at that time, many personnel were transferred up, resulting in a bloated upper-level organization, with many people doing little, detached from the masses. Through rectification, we streamlined the upper levels and strengthened the grassroots, sending a large number of cadres back to their original units and classes to participate in struggle, criticism, and reform. Some departments were reduced by half, and the most reduced by four-fifths. The remaining personnel also took turns on duty, spending at least one-third of their time in classes participating in mass activities.

The committee members of the school and department revolutionary committees have seriously changed their style, personally overseeing the study of Chairman Mao's works, personally addressing active thoughts, doing ideological work, personally writing big-character posters, and participating in the mass movements of major criticism and struggle, criticism, and reform.

In summary, we must always be with the masses, accept the masses' supervision, and be willing to be students of the masses. Of course, it is not easy to do this; it is a matter of thoroughly transforming one's worldview. However, we have great confidence and courage. We resolutely respond to the great call of our red sun, Chairman Mao, in our hearts, casting aside all selfish thoughts, wholeheartedly serving as good servants of the people.

    接受群众监督甘当群众的小学生
    北京师范大学革命委员会
    我们无产阶级革命派当权以后，是继续保持谦虚谨慎作风，紧密地和群众打成一片，还是骄傲自满，脱离群众，当官作老爷，这是一场新的严峻考验。它是关系到能否把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的大事，是关系到能不能保持无产阶级本色的问题。
    毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”。一年来的文化大革命，使我们深深体会到，正确对待群众的问题，是毛泽东思想的根本问题，是以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线和资产阶级反动路线的分水岭。事实证明：凡是充分相信群众、依靠群众的，运动就搞得轰轰烈烈，生气勃勃，沿着毛主席所指引的正确方向胜利前进。否则，运动就会冷冷清清，没有生气，甚至走上邪路。
    今年四月，我校筹备建立革命委员会。事先“三结合”筹备小组作了大量工作，在干部中大揭阶级斗争的盖子，用阶级观点区分干部队伍，并对结合的对象进行了大量调查研究。在此基础上提出了“三结合”的初步名单。我们以为这样的名单是有权威的。可是这个名单同群众见面之后，却提出了很多意见，并对我们工作中贯彻群众路线的问题，提出了尖锐的批评。针对这些情况，领导核心及时召开会议作了研究。革命组织的负责人谭厚兰同志接受了群众意见，向全校作了动员报告，讲明了毛主席“三结合”方针的伟大意义，提出了建立“三结合”临时权力机构的几点意见。会后，我们充分发动群众开展大鸣大放大辩论。事实证明，群众发动起来以后，掌握了毛主席的干部政策，用林彪副主席提出的三条标准看干部，对干部就可以识别清楚。结果在很短的时间内实现了革命的“三结合”，成立了校革命委员会，大部分系也随之成立了系的革命委员会。
    最近，我校革命师生热烈响应毛主席的伟大号召，复课闹革命，并在此基础上，展开对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大揭发、大批判、大斗争。我们吸取过去的经验教训，没有采取少数人制定方案的做法，而是充分发动群众，组织大家认真学习毛主席的有关指示。同时，也学习北京市革命委员会的有关决定和报告，深刻领会开展大批判的伟大意义。针对同学中存在的一些问题，如大批判如何同本单位斗批改相结合，要不要以教学革命为中心开展大批判运动，在大批判中如何活学活用毛主席著作等等，开展了大辩论。全校和各系各班都召开了学习会、讨论会、辩论会。不少班都提出了大批判的计划方案。校革委会集中了群众的智慧，吸取了各种方案的优点，制定了全校大批判的计划。现在全校一个大批判、斗批改的新高潮正在形成。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们一切工作干部，不论职位高低，都是人民的勤务员”，“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”。我们遵照毛主席的教导，经常注意听取群众的意见，不管正确的意见或者错误的意见都要听，特别是注意听取与自己不同的意见。因此，在全校造成了群众敢于批评监督干部，敢于发表不同意见的民主空气。每一件新的任务提出来，群众都纷纷献计献策。每当我们的工作中产生了这样或那样的缺点和错误，群众都能抱着“知无不言”的态度，大胆地提出来。我们对群众的意见加以分析，凡是正确意见，就坚决接受，立即照办；对于不正确的意见，也能虚心听取。有些批评很尖锐，但意见本身是正确的，我们就很好地接受。比如革委会一些同志长期浮在上面，脱离群众，慢慢地滋长了“当官”的思想，群众贴了一张“不要打倒老爷作少爷”的大字报。问题虽然提得很尖锐，但是抓住了要害。革委会常委会马上召开了会议，开展了批评和自我批评。大家认识到这个问题的严重性，有的同志立即贴出大字报，作了自我批评。在群众的监督下，革命委员会的工作有了较大改进。
    我们学习了人民解放军在一个战役到另一个战役之间进行整训的经验，发动群众总结检查前一阶段的工作，对领导工作提意见，帮助领导干部整顿思想和工作作风。我们当权以后，曾经进行了三次整风，都收到了很好的效果。开始，有些同志存在着一些顾虑，担心反对我们的同学会乘机搞垮我们，因此不敢放手发动群众，决心不大。我们在驻校解放军的帮助下，统一了思想，决心开门整风。广大群众充分肯定了我们的斗争大方向是正确的，肯定了我们的成绩，同时对我们工作中的缺点提出了大量的批评和建议。事实证明，我们不但没有被整垮，而且越整越坚强，越整我们和群众关系越密切，更有战斗力。特别是最近的一次整风，对我们教育最深刻。《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》发表以后，我们就利用这个大好时机放手发动群众，帮助我们整风。广大群众对领导工作不突出政治，跟毛主席和党中央的指示精神不紧，以及某些铺张浪费的问题，提出了尖锐批评。不少大字报提出我们当权以后存在着五少五多：学毛主席著作少，参加群众活动少，写大字报少，参加生产劳动少，造反精神少；骄傲自满多，忙事务工作多，坐办公室多，开会多，官气多。这些问题集中说明了我们当权以后，随着地位的改变，思想上发生了变化。我们忘记了毛主席对我们提出的警告：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”现在我们再学习毛主席这些教导，感到格外亲切。这次整风，使我们头脑更加清醒，使我们认识到这是阶级斗争在我们革命队伍中的反映，是资产阶级糖衣炮弹对我们的进攻和侵蚀。大家认识到夺权仅仅是斗争的开始，掌好权用好权将更加艰巨。我们决心努力活学活用毛主席著作，认真地听取群众意见，与自己头脑里形形色色的小资产阶级思想作坚决斗争。
    随着整风运动的深入，我们发扬无产阶级革命派说干就干的精神，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事。在革委会成立初期，由于当时斗争需要，上调人员较多，形成上边机构庞大，人浮于事，脱离群众。我们通过整风，精简上层，充实基层，把大批的干部调回本单位、本班参加斗批改。有的部门砍去一半，最多的砍去五分之四。留下人员也轮流值班，至少有三分之一时间到班级参加群众活动。
    校系革委会的委员，认真改变作风，亲自抓毛主席著作学习，亲自抓活思想，做思想工作，亲自写大字报，参加大批判和斗批改的群众运动。
    总之，我们要永远和群众在一起，接受群众的监督，甘当群众的小学生。当然，要做到这一点是不容易的，这是一个彻底改造世界观的问题，但是，我们有极大的信心和勇气，我们坚决响应我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的伟大号召，丢掉一切私心杂念，全心全意当好人民的勤务员。
