The Soviet revisionist clique has exhausted all their efforts to cover up their treacherous acts in the Middle East, but all their attempts have backfired. The more they try, the more they expose their traitorous nature.

Recently, the Soviet revisionists sent a fleet to Alexandria and Port Said in the United Arab Republic (UAR) in a show of force. Needless to say, the Soviet revisionists intended this as a gesture of "support" for the Arab countries. However, this gesture is nothing but a joke.

At the end of May and the beginning of June, Israel, under the orders of U.S. imperialism, actively prepared to launch a military attack on the Arab countries. The U.S. dispatched a large number of warships to the Mediterranean and the Red Sea to support Israel. At that time, the Soviet revisionists also sent more than ten warships to the Mediterranean, pretending to support the Arab countries. However, after Israel launched a surprise attack on Syria, the UAR, and other countries, the U.S. Sixth Fleet's aircraft carriers immediately dispatched planes to join the battle, while the Soviet revisionists' warships stood idly by, and later disappeared without a trace. The Arab people have long since experienced the Soviet revisionists' so-called "support."

Now, the Soviet revisionist clique, in collusion with U.S. imperialism, is using the so-called "resolutions" of the United Nations to force the Arab countries to accept a "ceasefire," allowing Israel to succeed in its aggression. The Soviet fleet then appeared in the UAR's ports in full view. The commander of the Soviet fleet even solemnly declared that the Soviet ships, including missile-launching vessels, were prepared to "counter any aggression" together with the UAR's forces and swore to "resolutely eliminate the consequences of Israel's aggression." If this were true, then the Soviet fleet that has already arrived in the UAR would not be idle. Large areas of UAR territory are still occupied by Israeli aggressors, and the Arab people's struggle against aggression is far from over. The consequences of Israel's aggression urgently need to be eliminated. However, what the commander of the Soviet fleet did in the UAR was limited to "courtesy visits." Is this supposed to be support for the Arab people?

Even more ironic is that on the day after the commander promised to "counter any aggression" together with the UAR's forces, Israeli aggressors attacked UAR ships just five miles away from where the Soviet fleet was anchored. The UAR's navy bravely fought back against the aggressors, but the Soviet fleet did not join them in countering the aggression; instead, it turned a deaf ear and stood by idly. The bluff has been called, and they have been embarrassed on the spot!

Chairman Mao has said, "Falsehood is falsehood, and the disguise should be peeled off." The Soviet revisionist clique can only rely on disguises to get by. However, the revolutionary people are constantly peeling off their disguises. At the same time, due to their panic, they are constantly tearing off their own disguises with their own hands, revealing their true traitorous selves. In this way, the Soviet revisionist clique is accelerating its own doom.

    当场出丑
    苏修集团为了掩饰他们在中东事件中的叛卖行径，真是挖空了心思，费尽了力气。然而他们所有这些徒然的努力，却反而是弄巧成拙。他们越是这样做，就越加暴露自己的叛徒面目。
    最近，苏修集团派出了一支舰队，威风凛凛地开到阿联的亚历山大港和塞得港“访问”。不消说，苏修集团是以此作为“支持”阿拉伯国家的一种姿态的。但是，这种姿态只能使人嗤之以鼻。
    五月底六月初，以色列在美帝国主义的指使下，积极准备对阿拉伯国家发动武装进攻，美国的军舰大批向地中海和红海地区调动，为以色列助威。当时苏修也曾把十多艘军舰派到地中海去，作出一副支持阿拉伯国家的样子。但是，当以色列对叙利亚、阿联等国家发动了突然袭击以后，美国第六舰队的航空母舰就马上出动飞机参战，而苏修的军舰却是隔岸观火，后来干脆不知去向。苏修的所谓“支持”，阿拉伯人民早就领教够了。
    现在，苏修集团伙同美帝国主义利用联合国的所谓“决议”迫使阿拉伯国家接受了“停火”，让以色列侵略得手之后，苏修的舰队又大模大样地出现在阿联的港口了。苏修舰队的司令还煞有介事地宣称：苏修的舰只，包括火箭发射船，准备同阿联的部队一起“回击任何侵略”，而且指天发誓要“坚决消除以色列侵略的后果”。如果真是这样的话，那末已经到了阿联的苏修舰队并不是没有事情可做的。阿联的大片领土仍然被以色列侵略军占领着，阿拉伯人民的反侵略斗争远远没有结束，以色列侵略的后果亟待消除。然而，这位舰队司令在阿联所干的却仅限于“礼节性的拜访”。难道这就算是对阿拉伯人民的支持吗？
    更有讽刺意味的是，在这位司令保证要同阿联部队一起“回击任何侵略”的第二天，以色列的侵略军就在离苏修舰队停泊的地点只有五英里的海面上攻击阿联的船只。阿联的海军对侵略者进行英勇的还击，苏修的舰队却并没有同他们一起反击侵略，而是装聋作哑，袖手旁观。牛皮吹破，当场出丑！
    毛主席说过：“假的就是假的，伪装应当剥去。”苏修集团现在只能靠伪装混日子。但是，革命人民不断地剥去他们的伪装。同时，他们由于手足失措，也不断用自己的双手把伪装撕破，露出他们这些叛徒的本来面目。苏修集团就是这样加速着自己的灭亡。
