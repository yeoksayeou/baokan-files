Title: A Problem Worth Noting

Currently, under the impetus of the revolutionary criticism movement, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary masses, and revolutionary cadres in rural areas across the country have, following the successful harvest of summer crops, pressed ahead to focus on managing autumn crops, striving for a bumper harvest for the entire year. However, as reflected in this letter, some production teams have been hindered in their collective production due to differing views among revolutionary mass organizations. This is a problem worth noting.

Everyone knows that it is normal for different revolutionary mass organizations to hold different views and opinions. As long as everyone firmly remembers Chairman Mao's teachings and firmly grasps the correct direction of the struggle, it is possible to seek common ground while reserving differences.

Seeking common ground means directing the struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. On the basis of unity in the major direction, we should unite and follow Chairman Mao's directive to "grasp revolution, promote production" and do a good job in socialist collective production. Conflicts arising from differing opinions among various revolutionary organizations should be resolved according to the principle of unity-criticism-unity, especially by engaging in more self-criticism.

Now is the busy season for managing autumn crops. It is hoped that the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary comrades of the proletariat in rural areas will study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively, promptly solve problems existing in revolution and production, and seize the opportunity to wage a high-quality battle in managing autumn crops.

    一个值得重视的问题
    目前，在革命大批判的推动下，各地农村广大贫下中农、革命群众和革命干部，继夺取夏粮大丰收之后，正乘胜前进，抓紧秋田管理，争取全年农业大丰收。可是，正如这封来信所反映的，有的生产队由于革命群众组织之间观点不同，妨碍了共同搞好集体生产。这是一个值得重视的问题。
    大家知道，各革命群众组织之间持有不同观点、不同意见，本来是正常的现象。只要大家都牢记毛主席的教导，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，是可以做到求大同、存小异的。
    求大同，就是把斗争的矛头，指向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，在大方向一致的基础上团结起来，并且遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的方针，搞好社会主义集体生产。各革命组织由于不同的意见而引起的矛盾，应该根据团结——批评——团结的原则，特别是多做自我批评来求得解决。
    现在，正是秋田管理大忙时期，希望农村广大贫下中农和无产阶级革命派同志，活学活用毛主席著作，及时地解决革命和生产中存在的问题，不失时机地、高质量地打好秋田管理这一仗。
