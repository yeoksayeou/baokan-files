Mao Zedong said: “‘Lifting a stone only to drop it on one’s own toes,’ this is a Chinese proverb used to describe the behavior of certain fools. The reactionaries of all countries are precisely such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people ultimately only serve to promote a more extensive and more violent revolution among the people.”

The biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and some counter-revolutionary revisionists, have, at a time when class struggle is extremely sharp and complex, one by one jumped out to stage a big performance and expose themselves, launching a frenzied counterattack against the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. They are self-satisfied, thinking that by doing so they can extinguish the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

It is an objective law, independent of people’s will, that the enemies of the proletariat will stubbornly come out to perform. They always misjudge the situation of class struggle.

In this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, a few jumping jacks coming out to perform is nothing to be surprised about! In fact, they are all paper tigers, very weak. Let them perform! The more eagerly they perform, the more thoroughly they expose themselves, and the faster and more completely they will collapse. It seems like a bad thing, but in reality, it is a very good thing.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat is being carried out under the leadership of the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao. The proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao is the most authoritative, most prestigious, and most correct Marxist-Leninist headquarters in the world. It represents the revolutionary truth of the proletariat, the fundamental interests of the broad masses, and the direction of historical progress. Whoever dares to oppose this great revolutionary headquarters will certainly be struck down by the Chinese revolutionary people and the People’s Liberation Army armed with Mao Zedong Thought, will certainly become a rat crossing the street, with everyone shouting to beat it, and will certainly meet a bad end!

The greatness of Mao Zedong Thought lies in trusting the strength of the masses and relying on the strength of the masses. The revolutionary masses of the proletariat, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, because they hold the banner of truth in their hands, can at any time openly declare their political stance and the direction of their political actions to the broad masses, and engage in open and serious struggles to oppose the main enemies at present. Their stance is firm and correct, and their actions are upright and above board.

On the contrary, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the like, their actions go against the fundamental interests of the people and against truth. Therefore, they can only live by lies. Rumors have short legs, and the more bizarre the rumors, the faster they will be exposed. They vainly try to instigate armed struggles among the masses. The more fiercely they do so, the more they will alienate the masses and make the masses see through their true colors. The masses who are temporarily deceived will certainly wake up, turn against them, and rise up in rebellion.

We, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the officers and soldiers of the People’s Liberation Army throughout the country, pledge to defend Chairman Mao, to defend Vice Chairman Lin, to defend the Party Central Committee, and to defend the Central Cultural Revolution Group. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, whoever opposes Vice Chairman Lin, whoever opposes the Party Central Committee, whoever opposes the Central Cultural Revolution Group, we will overthrow them!

The tide of history rolls on, and the revolutionary situation is excellent. We, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, will forever believe in the wisdom and strength of the masses, firmly believe in the boundless power of Mao Zedong Thought, and firmly believe in the invincibility of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. Under the great helmsman Chairman Mao’s guidance, we will certainly be able to expose all the handful of power-holders within the Party, the government, and the army who are taking the capitalist road, and fight them down politically, ideologically, and theoretically, making them completely collapse, and thus achieve even greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

### 搬起石头打自己的脚

    搬起石头打自己的脚
    毛主席说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”
    党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，一些反革命修正主义分子，在阶级斗争十分尖锐、复杂的时刻，一个个地跳了出来，大表演，大暴露，对无产阶级革命派，进行疯狂反扑。他们洋洋自得，以为这样一来，就可以把轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命烈火扑灭下去。
    无产阶级的敌人要顽强地出来表演，这是不以人们意志为转移的客观规律。他们总是错误地估计阶级斗争的形势。
    在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，有几个跳梁小丑，出来表演一番，没有什么了不起！其实都是纸老虎，虚弱得很。让它们表演去吧！表演得愈起劲，就暴露得愈充分，也就垮台得愈快，愈彻底。看起来，仿佛是坏事，实际上是大大的好事。
    无产阶级专政下的文化大革命，是在以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部领导下进行的。以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，是世界上最有权威、最有威望、最正确的马克思列宁主义的司令部。它代表无产阶级的革命的真理，代表广大群众的根本利益，代表历史前进的方向。谁胆敢反对这个伟大的革命司令部，就一定要遭到用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国革命人民和人民解放军的痛击，一定成为过街的老鼠，人人喊打，一定没有好下场！
    毛泽东思想的伟大，就是信任群众的力量，依靠群众的力量。用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派，由于自己手中握有真理的旗帜，所以能够随时公开地向广大群众表明自己的政治态度和政治行动的方向，进行公开和严肃的斗争来反对当前主要的敌人。他们的立场坚定正确，他们的行动光明磊落。
    相反，党内走资本主义道路当权派等一小撮，他们的所作所为，违背人民群众的根本利益，违背真理，因此，他们只能靠谎言过日子。谣言是腿短的，造谣造得愈离奇，就破产得愈快。他们妄图挑起群众武斗，他们搞得愈凶，就愈是脱离群众，使群众认清他们的真面目。一时受蒙蔽的群众，一定会醒悟过来，反戈一击，起来造他们的反。
    我们全国无产阶级革命派和人民解放军三军指战员，誓死保卫毛主席，誓死保卫林副主席，誓死保卫党中央，誓死保卫中央文革小组。谁反对毛主席，谁反对林副主席，谁反对党中央，谁反对中央文革小组，我们就打倒谁！
    历史的潮流滚滚向前，革命的形势一片大好。我们无产阶级革命派永远永远坚信群众的智慧和力量，坚信毛泽东思想威力无穷，坚信毛主席的无产阶级革命路线所向无敌。在伟大舵手毛主席指引下，我们一定能够把混进党里，政府里，军队里的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派统统揪出来，从政治上、思想上、理论上，把他们彻底斗倒，斗垮，斗臭，从而夺取无产阶级文化大革命的更加伟大的新胜利。
