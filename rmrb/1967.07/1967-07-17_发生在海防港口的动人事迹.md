At three o'clock in the afternoon on March 13, 57-year-old Vietnamese dockworker Nguyen Van Tue was working at Pier 3 of the Hai Phong Port. At that moment, a Chinese crew member accidentally dropped his Chairman Mao badge into the river. Seeing this, Nguyen Van Tue, without a moment's hesitation, braved the icy wind and jumped into the cold river. He searched again and again until he finally retrieved the shining Chairman Mao badge. Those present were deeply moved by the old Vietnamese worker's action, which showed his love for Chairman Mao, the great leader of the Chinese and world people. The crew member who lost the badge tightly grasped Nguyen Van Tue's hand, moved to tears, and insisted on giving him the badge as a keepsake, personally pinning it onto his chest.

This old Vietnamese worker, who had suffered much under the oppression and exploitation of feudal landlords and imperialists in the old society, said with great emotion when asked why he had jumped into the river to retrieve the Chairman Mao badge despite the cold: "Although I live in Hai Phong, far from China, the great image of Chairman Mao and the high spirits of the Chinese people in resolutely supporting the Vietnamese people's struggle against American aggression and for national salvation are deeply engraved in my heart. Mao Zedong Thought is deeply imprinted in my mind. Because I love and admire Chairman Mao so much, when I saw the Chairman Mao badge fall into the river, I jumped into the river without hesitation to retrieve it."

    发生在海防港口的动人事迹
    一月十三日下午三点多钟，五十七岁的越南装卸工人阮文资正在海防港口的三号码头工作。这时，一位中国船员胸前佩戴的毛主席像章不慎掉到河里去了。阮文资看到后，冒着刺骨的寒风，毫不犹豫地跳进了冰凉的河水里，摸了一次又一次，终于把这枚闪闪发光的毛主席像章捞了上来。这时，在场的人们都为这位越南老工人热爱中国和世界人民伟大领袖毛主席的行动所感动。丢失像章的船员紧紧地握着阮文资的手，激动地一定要把这枚毛主席像章送给他作纪念，并亲自给他戴在胸前。
    这位在旧社会饱受了封建地主和殖民主义者的欺凌与压榨的越南老工人，在谈到他为什么要不顾严寒跳下水去寻找毛主席像章时，满怀激情地说：我虽然生活在离中国很远的海防，但是毛主席的伟大形象和中国人民坚决支援越南人民抗美救国斗争的高度热情却深深地铭刻在我的心中，毛泽东思想深深地印在我的头脑里。因为我对毛主席无比热爱、无比钦佩，所以当我看到毛主席像章掉到河里后，就不顾一切地跳到河里，一定要把像章捞起来。
