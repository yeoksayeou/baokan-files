Thousands of black people in Detroit, who have risen up to resist violence, after two days and nights of bloody battles, on the evening of the 25th, further displayed their heroic spirit of fearlessness in the face of violence and fearlessness of sacrifice. They fought back more fiercely against the brutal suppression by nearly 20,000 armed military police.

On the 25th, thousands of federal paratroopers, under Johnson's orders, were deployed in the city, setting up checkpoints at major intersections. National Guard soldiers and armed police, riding in tanks, armored cars, trucks, and patrol cars, rampaged through the streets, killing and arresting indiscriminately. However, as night fell, they found themselves in a passive and disorganized situation.

Black snipers, in groups of three to five, appeared suddenly and attacked from all directions. They, along with some black youths armed with machine guns, surrounded two police stations, a fire station, and a National Guard command center, forcing the enemy to retreat into the buildings, too afraid to come out. Due to the fear of sniper attacks, the police headquarters in the city center was in complete darkness, not even daring to turn on the lights. A squad of National Guard soldiers was driven away by black snipers; forty police officers in ten patrol cars retreated in disarray under the intense fire of black snipers. Black snipers once controlled a large area in the western part of the city, driving away all the National Guard soldiers and armed police. The battle continued until this morning, and gunshots could still be heard on the streets filled with rubble.

According to incomplete statistics, in the three-day resistance against violence, more than 2,800 blacks and poor whites who participated in the battle were arrested. Currently, the prisons in Detroit are full of arrested blacks, and the courts are holding trials day and night to illegally interrogate the arrested blacks.

President Johnson's special envoy, Vance, repeatedly urged businesses to reopen, shops to resume operations, and workers to return to work to create the illusion of a return to normalcy and stabilize public sentiment. However, by the 25th, the automobile industry had not yet resumed normal production; some military equipment production for the Vietnam War had also come to a halt; many small shops remained closed, and some major roads were still under the control of black snipers and impassable; there were few vehicles and pedestrians on the streets. Western news agencies admitted that this fifth-largest city in America and the world's largest automobile industrial center was effectively paralyzed.

At the same time that the black people in Detroit were continuing their struggle, seven other important cities in Michigan—Grand Rapids, Pontiac, Flint, Saginaw, and others—also erupted in black resistance against violence, and the situation was becoming more intense. Western news agencies reported on the 25th that the situation in Grand Rapids was "extremely dangerous." Governor Romney declared a state of emergency in these cities on the 25th and announced the immediate deployment of an "appropriate number" of National Guard soldiers and police from Detroit to suppress the unrest in these cities.

On the same evening, in Rochester, New York, Phoenix, Arizona, Chicago, Cleveland, and a series of other important cities, black resistance against violence also erupted in varying scales. Western news agencies anxiously pointed out that the simultaneous outbreak of black resistance against violence in more than ten major cities in one night was unprecedented.

Faced with the rising tide of black self-defense violence, U.S. Senator Robert Kennedy was forced to admit that this was the "most serious domestic crisis" in over a hundred years.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 25th, Washington: As the black self-defense struggle in Detroit reached its peak, Puerto Ricans in New York's East Harlem and blacks in many large and small towns across the United States also raised the banner of self-defense struggle. These struggles supported and echoed each other, plunging the American ruling class into a state of panic and exhaustion.

Starting on the 22nd, more than 2,000 Puerto Rican youths in East Harlem fought fiercely with large numbers of armed police for three consecutive nights. The incident was triggered by the brutal shooting of a Puerto Rican youth by New York City police in the early hours of the 22nd. A large number of Puerto Rican and black crowds rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, surrounding the police involved and angrily protesting. The reactionary authorities sent over a thousand fully armed police and "riot control teams" to suppress the protests. However, the Puerto Ricans and blacks were fearless. Some held meetings to denounce the police's atrocities, while others took up positions on rooftops and in doorways, fighting bravely with bricks and stones against the military police.

By the evening of the 24th, the number of Puerto Ricans participating in the struggle had exceeded 2,000. Some Puerto Rican snipers opened fire on the police from the rooftops. The enraged Puerto Ricans also broke into some bourgeois shops, distributing daily necessities to the poor Puerto Ricans, and set fire to the shops that exploited them the most. By the morning of the 25th, the struggle had spread across the Harlem River into the Bronx.

Almost at the same time, several hundred blacks in Rochester, New York, began a two-night self-defense struggle against 400 police starting on the 23rd. On the night of the 24th, the black crowds also broke into the largest gun shop in the area, seizing a large number of weapons and ammunition for their self-defense struggle.

In Cambridge, Maryland, a black resistance against violence also erupted on the night of the 24th. More than 1,000 blacks fought with the military police throughout the night, and snipers engaged in fierce gun battles with the military police.

In addition, in Flint, Kalamazoo, Grand Rapids, and Pontiac in Michigan, Toledo, Lima, Oberlin, and Youngstown in Ohio, Houston in Texas, and many other cities in various states, black self-defense struggles of varying scales also occurred over the past two days.

The armed struggle of American blacks is unfolding vigorously. On July 23, American blacks in Detroit ignited the flames of resistance, turning the houses and shops of white capitalists and police stations into a sea of fire.

On July 24, at a black demonstration in Cambridge, a black youth gave a speech, calling on everyone to break through all obstacles and resolutely fight against the American reactionary forces.

    美国黑人武装抗暴斗争如火如荼
    美官员惊呼这是美国一百多年来最严重的国内危机
    新华社二十六日讯　华盛顿消息：美国底特律市数以千计奋起抗暴的黑人群众，在经历两昼夜浴血奋战之后，二十五日晚上进一步发挥不畏强暴、不怕牺牲的英雄气概，用更加炽烈的战斗来抗击近两万名武装军警血腥镇压的暴行。
    二十五日白天，奉约翰逊命令开进市区的数千名联邦空降部队，杀气腾腾地在市内各交通要道布下了岗哨。国民警卫队士兵和武装警察分乘坦克、装甲车、卡车、巡逻车，在街道上横冲直闯，乱杀乱捕。但是入夜以后，他们却陷入了被动挨打的狼狈境地。
    黑人狙击手在夜间三五成群，神出鬼没地到处出击。他们和部分拥有机枪的黑人青年先后包围了两处警察所、一处消防站和一处国民警卫队指挥中心，打得敌人龟缩在屋子里，不敢露头。由于害怕狙击手袭击，市中心的警察总部一片漆黑，连灯也不敢开。一队国民警卫队士兵被黑人狙击手打得抱头逃窜；分乘十辆巡逻车的四十名警官在黑人狙击手密集的火力下，仓惶败退。黑人狙击手一度控制了西城区的大片地区，赶跑了那里的全部国民警卫队和武装警察。战斗一直坚持到今天清晨，在堆满瓦砾的街道上还不时响起密集的枪声。
    根据不完全的统计，在历时三昼夜的抗暴斗争中，一共有两千八百多名参加战斗的黑人和贫苦白人被捕。目前底特律市的监狱已经关满了被捕的黑人，法院正昼夜不停地开庭，对被捕黑人进行非法审讯。
    总统特派代表万斯一再要求企业开工、商店开业、工人上班工作，以便造成一种局势恢复正常的假象来稳定人心。但是到二十五日为止，汽车工业仍然未能恢复正常生产；一些供应侵越战争需要的军火生产也陷于停顿；大批小商店仍然停业，一些交通要道仍然在黑人狙击手火力控制下无法通行；大街上车辆和行人都很稀少。西方通讯社承认，这个美国第五大城市、世界最大的汽车工业中心实际上已处于瘫痪状态。
    就在底特律市黑人群众坚持斗争的同时，密执安州的另外七个重要城市大瀑布城、蓬地亚克市、弗林特、萨吉瑙等也分别爆发了黑人抗暴斗争，而且越演越烈。西方通讯社在二十五日的报道中惊呼，大瀑布城的局势“十分危急”。州长罗姆尼二十五日宣布以上城市都处于“紧急状态”，并且宣布从底特律紧急抽调“适当数量”的国民警卫队和警察在这些城市进行镇压。
    同一天晚上，在纽约州的罗契斯特、亚利桑那州的凤凰城、芝加哥、克利夫兰等一系列重要城市也都分别爆发了规模不等的黑人抗暴斗争。西方通讯社不安地指出，在一夜间同时有十多个重要城市爆发黑人抗暴斗争，这种情况是前所未见的。
    面对着日益高涨的黑人暴力自卫斗争浪潮，美国参议员罗·肯尼迪被迫承认，这是美国一百多年来“最严重的国内危机”。
    据新华社二十五日讯　华盛顿消息：在底特律黑人暴力自卫斗争进入高潮时，纽约东哈莱姆区的波多黎各人和美国许多大小城镇的黑人也同时举起了暴力自卫斗争的旗帜，这些斗争彼此支持，互相呼应，使美国统治阶级陷入一片慌乱、疲于奔命的狼狈处境。
    从二十二日开始，纽约东哈莱姆区的二千余名波多黎各青年接连三夜同大批武装警察进行了激烈战斗。事件的起因是，纽约市警察在二十二日深夜野蛮枪杀了一名波多黎各青年。大批波多黎各群众和黑人群众闻讯赶来，他们包围了行凶的警察，愤怒地提出了抗议。反动当局竟然先后派出一千名全副武装的警察和“防暴队”前往镇压。但是波多黎各人和黑人毫不畏惧。他们有的开会控诉警察的暴行，有的据守在屋顶上，门洞里，用砖头石块等和军警展开了激烈和英勇的搏斗。
    到了二十四日晚，参加斗争的波多黎各人已超过两千人，一些波多黎各的狙击手从屋顶上向警察开火。愤怒的波多黎各人还打开了一些资产阶级的商店，把生活日用品分给穷苦的波多黎各人，他们还把平时剥削他们最厉害的商店放火烧掉。到二十五日清晨，斗争已越过哈莱姆河向布朗克斯区扩展中。
    几乎就在这同时，纽约州罗契斯特市的数百名黑人从二十三日起同四百名警察展开了接连两夜的暴力自卫斗争。二十四日夜间，黑人群众还打开了当地最大的一家枪支店，夺取了大批武器和弹药，以便进行暴力自卫斗争。
    在马里兰州的坎布里奇市，二十四日夜里也爆发了黑人抗暴斗争。一千余名黑人和军警进行了通宵的搏斗，狙击手们还同军警进行了激烈的枪战。
    另外，在密执安州的弗林特、卡拉马祖、大瀑布城、蓬地亚克，俄亥俄州的托莱多、利马、奥伯林、扬斯敦，得克萨斯州的休斯敦以及其他州的许多城市，这两天也分别发生了规模不等的黑人暴力自卫斗争。
