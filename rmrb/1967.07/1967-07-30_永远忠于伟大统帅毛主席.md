The great proletarian cultural revolution, personally initiated and led by our most, most august leader Chairman Mao, has already achieved decisive victory. The situation of the great proletarian cultural revolution across the nation is excellent, truly excellent! The situation in Wuhan is also excellent. In Wuhan, the proletarian revolutionary masses, in their struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the military, have received the warm concern and powerful support of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin, the powerful support of the Central Committee and the Cultural Revolution Group of the Central Committee, and the powerful support of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the entire army. They are growing stronger with each passing day. The great proletarian cultural revolution in Wuhan is advancing victoriously, breaking through all obstacles!

At this crucial moment of the great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines in Wuhan, a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the military in Wuhan, and a handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes," have openly come out to oppose our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao, to oppose Vice Chairman Lin, to oppose the Cultural Revolution Group of the Central Committee, and to direct their spears at the proletarian headquarters represented by Chairman Mao. At this critical juncture, the broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Wuhan Air Force of the Wuhan Military Region have stood firmly on the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. Together with the broad masses of proletarian revolutionaries and revolutionary people, they have resolutely fought against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the military in Wuhan, and the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes." Our broad masses of officers and soldiers have limitless love for Chairman Mao, for Vice Chairman Lin, for the proletarian headquarters, for the Cultural Revolution Group of the Central Committee, and for the proletarian revolutionaries. Many officers and soldiers have, in this great struggle, bravely stood up, charged forward fearlessly, dared to defy powerful enemies, dared to withstand attacks, endured fatigue, fought bravely, broken through all obstacles, and passed severe tests. They have shown the spirit of proletarian revolutionaries, defending the great proletarian cultural revolution. The common vow of the broad masses of officers and soldiers is: Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, whoever opposes Vice Chairman Lin, whoever opposes the Central Committee, whoever opposes the Cultural Revolution Group of the Central Committee, whoever opposes the great proletarian cultural revolution, whoever suppresses the proletarian revolutionaries, is our mortal enemy, and we will definitely overthrow them! We are the people's army personally created and led by the great commander Chairman Mao, directly commanded by Vice Chairman Lin, and armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Our army is the strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat and the loyal defender of the great proletarian cultural revolution. To defend Chairman Mao, to defend Vice Chairman Lin, to defend the Central Committee, to defend the Cultural Revolution Group of the Central Committee, to defend the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, to support the proletarian revolutionaries, and to carry the great proletarian cultural revolution through to the end, we are ready to face any danger. The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the military, who attempt to sabotage the great proletarian cultural revolution, will definitely meet a bad end. The more the enemy rages, the faster they will meet their doom!

The facts of the great proletarian cultural revolution in Wuhan have taught us that the attitude towards Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, and the attitude towards the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao, is the dividing line between Marxism and revisionism, and the dividing line between revolution and counter-revolution.

Vice Chairman Lin said, "Chairman Mao is the greatest genius of the 20th century, Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times, and Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the entire Party, the entire army, and the entire nation." The words of Chairman Mao are all truths, one sentence is worth ten thousand sentences. We must have limitless faith and execute them resolutely. For Chairman Mao's instructions, we must execute what we understand and also execute what we do not understand. Sometimes we may not fully understand Chairman Mao's instructions, some we understand gradually in the process of execution, some we understand only after repeated practice, and some we understand only after many years of execution. We must firmly believe in Chairman Mao's instructions, follow them closely, and execute them resolutely. For Chairman Mao's series of brilliant instructions in the unprecedented great proletarian cultural revolution, we must execute them resolutely, implement them seriously, and practice them diligently. Only in this way can we make fewer mistakes and gradually deepen our understanding of Chairman Mao's instructions in the process of practice, and carry out the great proletarian cultural revolution well.

Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us: "Class struggle is an objective existence that does not change with one's will. That is to say, it is inevitable. One's will wants to avoid it, but it is impossible." He also said: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat. They will still make their last struggles in various ways after the country is pacified. They will try to restore their rule in China every day and every hour. This is inevitable and undoubted. We must never relax our vigilance." Although we have studied Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle many times and have followed Chairman Mao in waging class struggle for decades, we have not yet fully understood Chairman Mao's teachings. The sharp and complex class struggle in Wuhan has made us further understand that class and class struggle are the root of all phenomena in class society. The contradiction, opposition, antagonism, and struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie are the root of all our political life and social life today. Without this root, we cannot observe social phenomena, and we will observe them wrongly. We must never forget Chairman Mao's teachings on class and class struggle, repeatedly understand Chairman Mao's teachings from the practice of class struggle, and use them to guide all our actions.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Those who have infiltrated into the Party, the government, the army, and various cultural circles are a bunch of counter-revolutionary revisionists. Once the time is ripe, they will try to seize power, turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie." The class struggle under the dictatorship of the proletariat, concentrated in one point, is still the issue of power. The proletariat wants to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, while the bourgeoisie wants to overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat. Our People's Liberation Army is the pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat. The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the military in Wuhan, in order to realize their dream of restoring capitalism, are trying every means to seize the gun. They not only try to deceive some of the masses but also use various despicable methods such as spreading rumors, deceiving, and sowing discord to try to deceive and mislead some of our officers and soldiers, create contradictions between the broad revolutionary masses and the army, create chaos, and fish in troubled waters. Under the brilliant illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, we have opened our eyes and have not fallen for the enemy's tricks. We have fought resolutely against them. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "The People's Liberation Army should support the broad leftist masses." The army loves the people, and the people support the army. We will always stand with the proletarian revolutionaries. With the close unity of the officers and soldiers of our army, the proletarian revolutionaries, and the broad revolutionary masses, the doom of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the military is determined.

Ten thousand experiences and a million lessons boil down to one thing: to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works. We must have limitless love, limitless faith, and limitless loyalty to our great leader Chairman Mao, to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and to the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao. The work of supporting the left is primarily to support with Mao Zedong Thought. The process of carrying out the "three supports" and "two militaries" tasks is the process of using Mao Zedong Thought to transform the objective world and the subjective world. We must genuinely place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in a position higher than everything, greater than everything, earlier than everything, and more important than everything. We must use Mao Zedong Thought to command everything, guide everything, drive everything, and transform everything.

The broad masses of officers and soldiers of the Wuhan Air Force of the Wuhan Military Region have angrily denounced the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the military in Wuhan, and the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. In the past half year of supporting the left, due to our shallow understanding of the proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao and weak class struggle awareness, we have not resisted the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the military in Wuhan strongly enough. Under their deception and influence, we have also made some mistakes. We are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "To openly admit errors to the masses in a realistic and truthful manner and to correct them immediately." We resolutely support and protect the proletarian revolutionaries in Wuhan, stand shoulder to shoulder with them, heart to heart, breathe together, share the same fate, unite together, fight together, and win together. We must firmly grasp the grand direction of the struggle, direct the spearhead of the struggle at the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, especially the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the military in Wuhan. We vow to defend Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Central Committee, the Cultural Revolution Group of the Central Committee, and the great proletarian cultural revolution to the death. Whoever dares to oppose Chairman Mao, Vice Chairman Lin, the Central Committee, and the Cultural Revolution Group of the Central Committee, and the great proletarian cultural revolution, we will definitely overthrow them and never allow them to rise again!

We will forever be loyal to the great commander Chairman Mao!

Long live the victorious proletarian revolutionary line of Chairman Mao!

Long live the great proletarian cultural revolution!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the dictatorship of the proletariat!

Long live the great Communist Party of China!

Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand times ten thousand years!

    永远忠于伟大统帅毛主席
    武汉部队空军副司令员　刘丰
    我们最最伟大的领袖毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，已经取得了决定性的胜利。全国无产阶级文化大革命的形势一片大好，好得很！武汉地区同全国一样，形势大好。武汉地区的无产阶级革命派，在与武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的斗争中，得到我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林副主席的亲切关怀和有力支持，得到党中央和中央文革小组的有力支持，得到全国无产阶级革命派和全军指战员的有力支持，越战越强。武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命正乘风破浪地胜利前进！
    在武汉地区两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线大搏斗的重要时刻，武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和“百万雄师”中的一小撮坏头头，公开跳了出来，反对我们最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，反对林副主席，反对中央文革小组，把矛头直接指向了以毛主席为代表的无产阶级司令部。在这紧急关头，我们武汉部队空军广大指战员，坚定不移地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的立场上，同广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众一起，向武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和“百万雄师”中的一小撮坏头头，进行了坚决的斗争。我们的广大指战员，无限热爱毛主席，热爱林副主席，热爱无产阶级司令部，热爱中央文革小组，热爱无产阶级革命派。许多指战员，在这一场大搏斗中，挺身而出，勇往直前，不畏强暴，不怕围攻，不顾疲劳，英勇奋斗，冲破种种阻力，经受了严峻的考验，表现了无产阶级的革命硬骨头精神，保卫了无产阶级文化大革命。广大指战员共同的誓言是：谁反对毛主席，谁反对林副主席，谁反对党中央，谁反对中央文革小组，谁反对无产阶级文化大革命，谁镇压无产阶级革命派，谁就是我们的死敌，我们就要把他打倒！我们是伟大统帅毛主席亲手缔造和领导的、林副主席直接指挥的、用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民军队。我军是无产阶级专政的坚强柱石，是无产阶级文化大革命的忠实保卫者。为了保卫毛主席，保卫林副主席，保卫党中央，保卫中央文革小组，保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，支持无产阶级革命派，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，我们刀山敢上，火海敢闯。党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，妄图破坏无产阶级文化大革命，是绝不会有好下场的。敌人的疯狂，只会加速他们自己的灭亡！
    武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命的事实活生生地教育了我们，对毛主席和毛泽东思想采取什么态度，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线采取什么态度，这是马克思主义和修正主义的分水岭，是革命和反革命的分水岭。
    林副主席说，毛主席是二十世纪最伟大的天才，毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义，毛泽东思想是全党全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。毛主席的话，句句是真理，一句顶一万句，我们要无限信仰，坚决照办。对毛主席的指示，我们理解的要执行，不理解的也要执行。毛主席的指示，我们有时是不可能完全理解的，有的是在执行过程中逐渐理解的，有的是要经过反复实践才能理解的，有的是要在执行了以后许多年才能理解的。对毛主席的指示，我们必须坚信，必须紧跟，必须坚决照办。对于毛主席在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中一系列英明的指示，我们要坚决执行，认真贯彻，努力实践。只有这样，才能使我们少犯错误，并在实践的过程中，逐步地加深对毛主席的指示的理解，把无产阶级文化大革命搞好。
    毛主席一再教导我们：“阶级斗争是客观存在，不依人的意志为转移的。就是说，不可避免的。人的意志想要避免，也不可能。”又说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。这是必然的，毫无疑义的，我们务必不要松懈自己的警惕性。”对于毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的论述，我们虽然学习过许多次，我们虽然跟着毛主席搞了几十年的阶级斗争，可是，我们实际上还没有完全理解毛主席的教导。武汉地区尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，使我们进一步领会到，阶级和阶级斗争，是阶级社会一切现象的总根源。无产阶级和资产阶级这两个阶级的矛盾、对立、对抗和斗争，是今天我们全部的政治生活、社会生活的总根源。离开这个总根源去观察社会现象，就观察不出来，就会观察错了。我们必须念念不忘毛主席关于阶级和阶级斗争的教导，从阶级斗争的实践中反复领会毛主席的教导，用来指导我们的一切行动。
    毛主席教导我们：“混进党里、政府里、军队里和各种文化界的资产阶级代表人物，是一批反革命的修正主义分子，一旦时机成熟，他们就会要夺取政权，由无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政。”无产阶级专政下的阶级斗争，集中到一点，还是政权问题。无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，资产阶级要推翻无产阶级专政。我们人民解放军，是无产阶级专政的柱石。武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，为了实现复辟资本主义的迷梦，千方百计要抓枪杆子。他们不仅要蒙蔽一部分群众，他们还采用造谣、欺骗、挑拨离间等种种卑鄙手法，挖空心思地企图欺骗和蒙蔽我军的一些指战员，制造广大革命群众和军队之间的矛盾，制造混乱，以便从中渔利。在毛泽东思想的光辉照耀下，我们擦亮了眼睛，没有上敌人的当，向他们进行了坚决的斗争。我们要牢记毛主席的教导：“人民解放军应该支持左派广大群众”。军爱民，民拥军，永远同无产阶级革命派站在一起。有了我军指战员和无产阶级革命派以及广大革命群众的紧密团结，就注定了党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派灭亡的命运。
    千条经验，万条教训，集中到一条，就是要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，对我们的伟大领袖毛主席，对战无不胜的毛泽东思想，对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，无限热爱，无限信仰，无限忠诚。支左工作首先是用毛泽东思想支援。执行“三支”“两军”任务的过程，就是用毛泽东思想改造客观世界和主观世界的过程。我们必须切切实实地把活学活用毛主席著作放在高于一切、大于一切、先于一切、重于一切的地位，用毛泽东思想去统帅一切，指导一切，带动一切，改造一切。
    我们武汉部队空军广大指战员，愤怒声讨武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，和被他们操纵的“百万雄师”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头。在过去半年的支左工作中，由于我们对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线理解不深，阶级斗争观念不强，对武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的抵制不够有力，在他们的欺骗和影响下，我们也犯过一些错误。我们决心按照毛主席的教导：“实事求是地公开向群众承认错误，并立即改正。”我们坚决地支持和保护武汉地区的无产阶级革命派，永远同他们肩并肩，心连心，同呼吸，共命运，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，把斗争锋芒对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对准武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。誓死保卫毛主席，保卫林副主席，保卫党中央，保卫中央文革小组，保卫无产阶级文化大革命。谁胆敢反对毛主席，反对林副主席，反对党中央和中央文革小组，反对无产阶级文化大革命，我们就坚决把他打倒在地，再踏上一只脚，叫他永世不得翻身！
    我们永远忠于伟大统帅毛主席！
    毛主席的革命路线胜利万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    无产阶级专政万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
