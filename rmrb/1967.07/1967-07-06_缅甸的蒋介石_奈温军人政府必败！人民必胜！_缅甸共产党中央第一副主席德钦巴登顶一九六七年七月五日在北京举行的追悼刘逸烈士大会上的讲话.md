Comrades!
Fellow fighters!
Friends!

Today, I represent the Burmese people, the Burmese Communist Party, and our party's chairman, Thakin Than Tun, to speak at the memorial meeting for Comrade Liu Yi.

First, I want to say that Comrade Liu Yi was a specialist sent to Burma to carry out economic construction tasks under the Sino-Burmese Economic Aid Agreement. He served the Burmese people with a high degree of proletarian internationalism. He was martyred while carrying out the tasks assigned by the state, killed by thugs instigated by the reactionary military government of Ne Win.

His sacrifice, with his blood, has established Sino-Burmese friendship. The Burmese people will never forget this and will always remember him.

The Burmese people and the Burmese Communist Party are deeply saddened by Comrade Liu Yi's heroic martyrdom. Here, I express my condolences to the Chinese people and the family of Comrade Liu Yi.

Now, I want to talk about the struggle of Burmese overseas Chinese youth students and their brothers. Their struggle is completely just and completely correct. Their just struggle will definitely win.

The reactionary military government of Ne Win will never be able to suppress their just struggle. The masters of Ne Win—U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership—will also not be able to suppress their just struggle.

Why? Because they have grasped the thoughts of the great world leader, Chairman Mao. Their struggle is just; the glorious 700 million Chinese people are with them, and the broad masses of the Burmese people are with them.

At this meeting, I once again declare that the Burmese Communist Party wholeheartedly supports the just struggle of the overseas Chinese and strongly protests the fascist atrocities of the Ne Win military government in killing overseas Chinese. We fully support the statement issued by the Government of the People's Republic of China on June 29, protesting the Ne Win military government.

In this struggle, martyrs such as Liu Yi, overseas Chinese student martyrs, and overseas Chinese martyrs have sacrificed their lives and shed their blood. Many have been injured, and many have been arrested and persecuted. It is understood that so far, in Rangoon alone, hundreds of overseas Chinese have been killed, and thousands of overseas Chinese students and overseas Chinese have been arrested.

This is a crime that will never be washed away in Burmese history! The blood debt owed by the Ne Win military government, including the martyrs such as Comrade Liu Yi, must be repaid in blood. We hereby declare that our party and the Burmese people, together with the Chinese people, will definitely demand this blood debt!

Next, I want to talk about why the Ne Win military government carried out this massacre.

The anti-China stance of the Ne Win military government is not accidental. The anti-China incident in Burma this time is connected with the anti-China movements in Indonesia, India, Hong Kong, and some other countries. It is a counter-revolutionary, anti-people, anti-revolutionary, and anti-China tide. All of this shows that the class struggle in the world is extremely sharp, and the world revolutionary movement has entered a new stage and a new high tide.

This incident is a joint plot by U.S. imperialism, the Soviet revisionist leadership, reactionaries from various countries, and the Kuomintang bandits. The anti-China atrocities instigated by the Ne Win military government are the result of their long-term implementation of anti-communist, anti-people civil war policies. It is the result of their reactionary foreign policy of further relying on and colluding with imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries from various countries. It is determined by their class nature.

The Ne Win military government carried out this massacre at a time when it was facing military, political, and economic collapse.

First, let me talk about its military collapse.

Under the leadership of Chairman Thakin Than Tun, the armed struggle of the Burmese Communist Party has been going on for nearly twenty years. Ne Win and his cohorts are the culprits who started the reactionary civil war. They started an unjust war, burning thousands of villages. They turned many villages into concentration camps like South Vietnam. They killed and arrested tens of thousands of peasants, raped many women, and massacred many communists.

With the aid of U.S. imperialism, and the aid of imperialists and reactionaries from Britain, Israel, West Germany, Japan, India, and others, the Ne Win military government launched a savage attack on the Burmese people's democratic revolution. They also received a lot of aid from modern revisionists like Khrushchev, Kosygin, Brezhnev, and Tito. Ne Win also received huge help from the Chinese Khrushchev.

However, the armed struggle in Burma has not collapsed. Now we are giving the Ne Win military government a fatal blow. The armed forces under the banner of the National Democratic United Front are continuously winning victories. The Shan, Kachin, Karen, Kayah, Mon, Pa-O, and other ethnic minorities are also waging armed struggles against the Ne Win military government. Now the revolutionary armed forces can attack and temporarily occupy small and medium-sized towns. According to incomplete statistics, there were more than 400 battles in 1966. The armed forces of our party have increased by 50%. Our guerrilla bases have expanded and become more consolidated. Our battle areas cover more than 60% of the national territory.

In October last year, our troops attacked a position only two miles away from Ne Win's official residence. In November, they seized supplies from the cooperative store in the suburbs of Rangoon. These battles shocked the Ne Win government. U.S. and British newspapers concluded the current military situation as follows: the revolutionary armed forces are forming a crescent-shaped encirclement around Rangoon. The Burmese government can control two-thirds of the national territory during the day but only half during the night. U.S. imperialism is worried that Burma will become a second Vietnam in the next two to three years.

The Ne Win military government has fired the first shot at Chinese nationals. Since he fired the first shot, it is only natural for us to counterattack. Because Ne Win fired the first anti-China shot, the armed struggle in Burma will definitely enter a new stage and reach a higher level. Now is the time for the armed struggle in Burma to gain the full sympathy and support of the 700 million Chinese people. The majority of the Burmese people who oppose Ne Win will be more united.

In the future, the armed struggle in Burma will be more powerful and widespread. The army of the Ne Win government will be destroyed even more. This is Ne Win digging his own grave.

We have been able to persist in nearly twenty years of armed struggle because we have taken Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as our guide. The brilliant victories we have achieved in the military are the victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

We have been able to persist in the struggle because we have established Chairman Mao's thought of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." It is because we have used the gun to oppose the thoughts and programs of the Chinese Khrushchev and the Soviet revisionist leadership, who wanted us to cooperate with Ne Win and become his disciples.

Our armed struggle began with the grasp of Chairman Mao's thoughts. As mentioned above, we not only accepted the completely correct thought of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," but also fought according to Chairman Mao's theory of prolonged war, with rural areas as the base and encircling the cities from the countryside. Our practice has proved that as long as there is a party armed with Chairman Mao's thoughts, and this party can first rely on the peasants, then even in a small country like Burma, it is possible to wage a prolonged war.

However, due to the sabotage of the Chinese Khrushchev, the Burmese revolution and the Chinese people have become distant relatives from close friends. The Chinese Khrushchev is close to Ne Win and harbors ill intentions towards the Burmese Communist Party. This is not accidental but has reasons. Our party has been a party loyal to Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought for more than twenty years. Therefore, it is natural that the Chinese Khrushchev, who opposes Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, does not like us.

Despite the Chinese Khrushchev not liking us, we still insist on self-reliance according to Chairman Mao's teachings and have been fighting for more than nineteen years. The Burmese revolution proves that as long as the people of various countries truly follow Chairman Mao's teachings on self-reliance, then the oppressed people of various countries can decide their own destiny with the spirit of "self-reliance." Our party is now studying Chairman Mao's works and emphasizes the need for everyone to learn and apply the works of our beloved Vice Chairman Lin Biao, "Long Live the Victory of People's War," in the struggle.

We believe that Chairman Mao's works are priceless treasures.

Ne Win and his cohorts also study Chairman Mao's works according to their understanding. However, their purpose is to insult Chairman Mao and the Chinese people, to insult the Burmese people and oppose the Burmese Communist Party.

The enemy is afraid of Mao Zedong Thought. Ne Win, the various revisionist elements, and the Chinese Khrushchev are all very afraid of Mao Zedong Thought.

As I said earlier, due to the rapid development of the armed struggle in Burma, the military crisis of the Ne Win military government has become even more serious.

The class struggle in Burma is extremely sharp. The Ne Win military government is facing a comprehensive crisis. This crisis is a time bomb about to explode.

In this situation, the Ne Win military government directed its spearhead at the Burmese Communist Party. They decided to launch another mad military attack on the Burmese Communist Party.

In foreign affairs, they also regard the People's Republic of China as the main danger. This was openly announced at the meeting of the Burmese Socialist Programme Party they held last November.

From these facts, it is clear that the Ne Win military government is an enemy of the Burmese people and also an enemy of the Chinese people.

This Ne Win military government has colluded even more openly with U.S. imperialism, Israel, Thailand, and the "Malaysian" reactionaries.

Before they massacred the overseas Chinese, they had talks with the representatives of the Indonesian fascist government, Malik.

Now I want to talk about the political crisis of the Ne Win military government.

Ne Win openly declared that his political line is not to accept Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, and not to accept the leadership of the proletariat. They say they want to favor the peasants, but their basis is the landlords and rich peasants. They hand over the real power to solve the peasant problem to reactionary village heads, bureaucrats, and officers. The "working people" they talk about are the bureaucratic exploitative class and the reactionary officers who massacre peasants. The real workers are only the objects of their exploitation and oppression.

Like Yugoslavia, Ne Win accepts aid from all imperialist and revisionist countries. He uses unjust wars to suppress the Communist Party. This is his "Burmese Socialist Programme."

The Soviet modern revisionists are now praising Ne Win for taking the non-capitalist road. The Chinese Khrushchev also directly told Ne Win to learn from Ne Win's socialist program.

However, the Burmese people have personal experience. They have seen with their own eyes that Ne Win's "Burmese Socialist Programme" has caused tens of thousands of people to be killed.

Under the rule of the Ne Win military government, even bourgeois democracy is gone. Four months after the military government came to power, on July 7, more than a hundred university students were shot in the capital Rangoon, and more than three hundred students were injured.

In November 1963, the Ne Win military government shamefully sabotaged peace talks and then disbanded all legal parties, arresting more than a thousand progressives. From then until now, they have been continuously arresting workers, peasants, students, writers, and entrepreneurs. All these facts show what? It shows that Ne Win is the Chiang Kai-shek of Burma, who practices military dictatorship in Burma.

The people have deeply felt that no matter what the problem is, whether it is culture, health, or the economy, the Ne Win military government cannot solve it. The situation is getting worse and worse.

Therefore, the people have seen through the falsehood of Ne Win's "Burmese Socialist Programme." Ne Win cannot fool people! Therefore, Ne Win has also exposed his true face, and Khrushchev, Kosygin, Brezhnev have also exposed their true faces to the Burmese people, and the Chinese Khrushchev has also exposed his true face.

Comrades, this is very clear to us.

It has never been heard that socialism can be established with the aid of U.S. imperialism. However, Ne Win, Khrushchev, and the Chinese Khrushchev say it can and are experimenting with it in Burma.

I will talk a bit more about the economic crisis of the Ne Win military government.

Ne Win's "Burmese Socialist Programme" has long brought a serious economic crisis to the country. Now, food and medicine are in short supply, prices are high, there are many speculators and black markets, to the point that Ne Win is at a loss to cope. The reason is that Ne Win's officers and civil servants are all involved in black market activities.

Regarding the shortage of supplies, I would like to give a few examples to illustrate.

Now, cooking oil is very scarce in Burma, and there is no oil for stir-frying. The Burmese people call dishes without oil or with very little oil "Ne Win dishes."

Now, the famine in Burma is very serious.

Burma is one of the countries that produce the most rice in the world. Even during World War II, when the entire country was a battlefield, the Burmese people relied on self-reliance and did not suffer from famine.

Before the war, Burma could export 300 million tons of rice in addition to domestic consumption; now, it can only export 60 million tons of rice, and domestically, it can only sell rice by the volume of a milk can. Under Ne Win's rule, famine has appeared. The government announced that by November and December this year, Burma may have no food. Therefore, it is required that the people save food. However, the famine has already begun. Workers have left the factories because they have no food to eat; peasants cannot work in the fields because they are not full. The phenomenon of eating grass roots and tree bark has already appeared. Malnutrition and diseases are rampant.

There have already been demonstrations demanding the solution of the food problem. In the capital Rangoon, each person can only buy a can of milk worth of rice per day. More than a thousand residents of the Dagon district demonstrated at the grain store because they had no rice for dinner. In Rangoon, some restaurants have already appeared that only sell vegetables and do not sell rice.

The people of the whole country are extremely angry with the Ne Win military government.

To get rid of the political, military, and economic crises and to consolidate its rule, the Ne Win military government has adopted despicable means. They instigated Sino-Burmese ethnic conflicts, trying to direct the anger of the Burmese people, which has erupted like a volcano, towards ethnic conflicts.

Everyone knows that the Ne Win military government started with the brutal massacre of overseas Chinese students and overseas Chinese. They first spread rumors and incited ethnic hatred, and then instigated ethnic conflicts. These despicable plots may achieve temporary success. However, the Sino-Burmese friendship established over the long term is solid and cannot be destroyed by anyone. No force in the world can destroy this friendship. Those who try to destroy this friendship will only end up like a madman hitting his head against a wall, ending up with a broken head and bleeding.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet,' this is a Chinese proverb used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of various countries are just such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the end, only promote a broader and more intense revolution among the people." Ne Win's anti-China stance is "lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet."

Before World War II, British imperialism once instigated Sino-Burmese conflicts. Apart from this, Sino-Burmese friendship is solid. It is a friendship as close as kin. The Burmese people call the Chinese "brothers," meaning relatives. Of course, Ne Win also calls the Chinese Khrushchev "brothers." This "brother" is their "brother," not the "brother" between the people, but only the "brother" between the master and the disciple.

Therefore, we believe that under the true spirit of Sino-Burmese friendship, not the hypocritical way of Ne Win and the Chinese Khrushchev, the struggle of the Burmese overseas Chinese will definitely win.

I will mention one thing in passing.

The reactionaries of various countries say that there are two kinds of communists. They say they are not afraid of the communists of Khrushchev, Kosygin, and Brezhnev and can be friends with such communists. They take the same attitude towards the communists of the Chinese Khrushchev. However, they are trembling with fear of the communists of Mao Zedong.

The enemy's analysis is very important. We should all become Mao Zedong-style communists.

The Burmese overseas Chinese, who fight under the guidance of Chairman Mao's teaching of "great to live, glorious to die," will definitely win.

The Burmese people will soon end this massacre, unite as one, and oppose Ne Win.

The Ne Win military government, which opposes the Chinese people and the Burmese people, must fail.

The Chinese Khrushchev, who suppresses the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards in China, cannot hold his head up in the masses; because of the fear of the influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and the revolutionary forces in Burma, the Ne Win military government, which suppresses the overseas Chinese, must fail.

The Chinese Khrushchev, who opposes Mao Zedong Thought, has lost all credibility; the Ne Win military government, which insults Chairman Mao, will also definitely fail.

We will definitely, together with the Chinese people, carry on the struggle against the Ne Win military government, the struggle against revisionism, and the struggle against the reactionaries of various countries to the end.

We will definitely strengthen our struggle against the Ne Win military government in our actual work.

Let U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism give more aid to the Ne Win military government.

No matter how great the sacrifices we have to endure, no matter how long the struggle we have to go through, we will definitely continue to fight.

We have gone through nearly twenty years of military struggle. We believe that with Chairman Mao's thoughts as our guide, we are not afraid of any enemy.

We will definitely overthrow the Ne Win military government and establish a lasting peaceful, happy, and completely independent Burma, and establish a people's democratic united front government that conforms to the will of the people.

Let us unite under the banner of Chairman Mao's thoughts, fight together, and win together!

We fully support the revolutionary, heroic, and just struggle of the Burmese overseas Chinese brothers! Sino-Burmese friendship is indestructible!

The reactionary military government of Ne Win must fail!

The people's democratic revolution must win!

Long live the unity of the peoples of Burma and China!

Long live the unity of the Burmese Communist Party and the Chinese Communist Party!

Long live proletarian internationalism!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution led by Chairman Mao!

Long live Marxism-Leninism-Mao Zedong Thought!

Down with U.S. imperialism!

Down with modern revisionism led by the CPSU!

Wishing Chairman Thakin Than Tun of the Burmese Communist Party good health!

Long live, long live, and ten thousand times long live the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao!

　　缅甸的蒋介石——奈温军人政府必败！人民必胜！
　　缅甸共产党中央第一副主席德钦巴登顶一九六七年七月五日在北京举行的追悼刘逸烈士大会上的讲话
　　同志们！
　　战友们！
　　朋友们！
    今天，我代表缅甸人民、缅甸共产党和我们党的主席德钦丹东同志，在刘逸同志追悼大会上讲话。
    首先我要讲的是，刘逸同志是根据中缅经济援助协定被派到缅甸去执行缅甸经济建设任务的一位专家。
    他是以高度的无产阶级国际主义精神为缅甸人民服务的。他是在执行国家所交给的任务时，遭到奈温军人反动政府唆使暴徒的杀害而英勇牺牲的。
    他的牺牲，以他的鲜血建立起了中缅友谊。对这一点，缅甸人民是永远不会忘记的，是会永远想念他的。
    缅甸人民和缅甸共产党对刘逸同志的英勇牺牲感到万分悲痛。在这里我向中国人民和刘逸同志的亲属表示慰问。
    现在我要讲的是，缅甸华侨青年学生和华侨兄弟进行的斗争是完全正义的，完全正确的。
    他们的正义斗争一定胜利。
    反动的奈温军人政府是绝对压不垮他们的正义斗争的。
    奈温的主子——美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团联合起来，也是压不垮他们的正义斗争的。
    为什么呢？
    因为他们掌握了伟大的世界领袖——毛主席的思想，他们的斗争是正义的；光荣的七亿中国人民和他们在一起，缅甸的广大人民和他们在一起。
    在这个大会上，我再一次声明，我们缅甸共产党衷心支持华侨的正义斗争，并且强烈抗议奈温军人政府残杀华侨的法西斯暴行。
    我们完全支持中华人民共和国政府六月二十九日抗议奈温军人政府的声明。
    在这场斗争中，刘逸烈士、华侨学生烈士和华侨烈士付出了自己的生命，洒下了鲜血。
    还有许多人受伤，许多人遭到逮捕和迫害。据了解，到目前为止，仅仰光一地，即有成百华侨被杀害，成千华侨学生和华侨被逮捕。
    这是缅甸历史上永远也洗刷不掉的大罪行！奈温军人政府欠下的这笔包括刘逸同志在内的烈士们的血债必须用血来偿还。我们在此声明，我们的党和缅甸人民一起，和中国人民一起，一定要讨还这笔血债！
    我接着要讲的是，奈温军人政府为什么要进行这次大屠杀。
    奈温军人反动政府的反华决不是偶然的。
    缅甸这一次反华事件同印尼、印度、香港以及一些国家的反华运动是有联系的，是一股反共、反人民、反革命、反华的逆流。所有这一切说明了全世界范围内的阶级斗争十分尖锐，世界革命运动已经进入一个新的阶段，新的高潮。
    这个事件是美帝国主义、苏联修正主义、各国反动派和国民党匪帮互相勾结，共同策划，事先预谋的一个事件。
    奈温军人政府挑起的反华暴行是它长期执行反共、反人民的内战政策的结果，是执行进一步依靠和勾结帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的反动的对外政策的结果，是由它的阶级本性决定的。
    奈温军人政府进行这次大屠杀的时候，也正是它在军事上、政治上、经济上大破产的时候。
    首先我想谈一谈他在军事上破产的情况。
    以德钦丹东主席为首的缅甸共产党领导下的武装斗争，已经进行了十九年多快二十年了。
    奈温及其一伙是挑起反动内战的罪魁祸首。
    他们挑起了非正义的战争，烧毁了成千成百的村庄。
    他们把许多村庄变成南越那样的集中营。
    他们杀害和逮捕了成千上万的农民，奸污了许多妇女，屠杀了许多共产党员。
    奈温军人政府在美帝国主义援助下，在英国、以色列、西德、日本、印度等帝国主义和反动派的援助下，向缅甸人民民主革命进行了猖狂的进攻。
    他们还得到了赫鲁晓夫、柯西金、勃列日涅夫、铁托等现代修正主义者的许多援助。
    奈温还得到了中国的赫鲁晓夫的巨大帮助。
    但是，缅甸的武装斗争并没有垮下去。现在我们正在给奈温军人政府以致命的打击。在民族民主团结阵线旗帜下的武装部队都不断取得胜利。掸、克钦、克伦、克耶、孟、勃欧等各少数民族也在进行反对奈温军人政府的武装斗争。现在革命武装已经能够攻打中小城镇，并暂时加以占领。据不完全统计，一九六六年共进行了四百多次战斗。我们党的武装力量增加了百分之五十。我们的游击根据地更加扩大了，更加巩固了。我们的战斗地区占全国面积的百分之六十以上。
    去年十月份，我们的部队袭击了离奈温官邸只有两英里的一个据点。十一月又缴获了仰光郊区合作商店的物资。这些战斗使奈温政府大为震惊。美、英报纸对当前的军事形势作了这样的结论：革命武装在对仰光形成新月形的包围圈，缅甸政府白天可以控制全国的三分之二地区，夜间只能控制二分之一的地区。美帝国主义担心缅甸在今后两三年内将发展成为第二个越南。
    奈温军人政府已向中国侨民开了第一枪。既然他开了第一枪，我们进行反击是理所当然的。
    由于奈温开了反华的第一枪，缅甸的武装斗争必将出现飞跃的形势，走向更高的阶段，因为现在的时机是缅甸的武装斗争得到七亿中国人民的充分的同情和支持，反对奈温的绝大多数的缅甸人民将更加团结起来。
    今后的形势是缅甸的武装斗争将更加发挥它的威力，更加广泛，奈温政府的军队将被消灭得更多。这就是奈温自掘坟墓。
    我们所以能够坚持将近二十年的武装斗争，是由于我们以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为指南。我们在军事上所取得的辉煌胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。
    我们所以能够坚持斗争，是由于我们树立了毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的思想，是由于我们使用了枪杆子、反对了中国的赫鲁晓夫和苏修领导集团要我们同奈温合作、并做奈温的门徒的思想和纲领的结果。
    我们的武装斗争是从掌握毛主席的思想开始的。如上所述，我们不仅是接受了“枪杆子里面出政权”这一完全正确的思想的指导，而且是按照毛主席以农村为根据地，农村包围城市这一持久战的理论进行战斗的。我们的实践证明，只要有一个用毛主席思想武装起来的党，这一个党首先又能依靠农民，那么，即使在象缅甸这样的小国，也是能够进行持久战的。
    但是由于中国赫鲁晓夫的破坏，缅甸革命同中国人民却从近友变成了远亲。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫对奈温亲，对缅甸共产党不怀好意。这不是偶然的，而是有原因的。我们党早在二十年以前就是一个忠于马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的党，因此，反对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的中国的赫鲁晓夫，对我们不好是很自然的。
    尽管中国的赫鲁晓夫不喜欢我们，我们还是按照毛主席的教导，坚持自力更生，进行了十九年以上的斗争。
    缅甸革命证明，只要各国人民真正按照毛主席关于自力更生的教导去做，那么，各国被压迫的人民就能够以“自力更生”精神自己决定自己的命运。我党现在正在大学毛主席著作，并且强调要求大家在斗争中活学活用我们敬爱的林彪副主席的著作《人民战争胜利万岁》。
    我们认为，毛主席著作是无价之宝。
    奈温及其一伙也按照他们的理解去研究毛主席著作。但是他们研究的目的是为了侮辱毛主席和侮辱中国人民，是为了侮辱缅甸人民和反对缅甸共产党。
    敌人是害怕毛泽东思想的。奈温、各国修正主义分子、中国的赫鲁晓夫，他们都非常害怕毛泽东思想。
    正如我在上面说的，由于缅甸武装斗争的迅速发展，奈温军人政府的军事危机就更加严重了。
    缅甸国内的阶级斗争是非常尖锐的。奈温军人反动政府面临着全面危机。这个危机是一颗即将爆炸的炸弹。
    在这种情况下，奈温军人政府把矛头指向了缅甸共产党。他们再次决定向缅甸共产党发动疯狂的军事进攻。
    他们在对外方面，还把中华人民共和国当做主要危险。这一点，他们去年十一月召开的缅甸社会主义纲领党会议已经公开加以宣布。
    从这些事实中可以清楚地看到奈温军人政府是缅甸人民的敌人，也是中国人民的敌人。
    这个奈温军人政府，同美帝国主义、以色列、泰国和“马来西亚”反动派进行了更加露骨的勾结。
    在没有屠杀华侨以前，他们同印度尼西亚法西斯政府的代表马立克进行过会谈。
    现在我想谈一下奈温军人政府的政治危机。
    奈温公开宣布他的政治路线是不接受马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的，是不接受无产阶级领导的。
    他们说要优待农民，其实他们的基础是地主和富农。
    他们把解决农民问题的实权交给反动村长、官僚和军官。
    他们所说的“劳动人民”就是官僚剥削阶级和屠杀农民的反动军官。真正的工人只是他们剥削和压迫的对象。
    奈温和南斯拉夫一样，接受一切帝国主义国家和修正主义国家的援助。
    他用非正义的战争镇压共产党。
    这就是他的“缅甸社会主义纲领”。
    苏联现代修正主义现在还在吹捧奈温走的是非资本主义道路。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫也直接对奈温说，要学习奈温的社会主义纲领。
    但是缅甸人民是有切身的体会的。他们亲眼看到，奈温的“缅甸社会主义纲领”使成千上万的人民遭到杀害。
    在奈温军人政府统治下，连资产阶级民主也没有了。军人政府上台后四个月，在七月七日，在缅甸首都仰光枪杀了一百多名大学生，打伤了三百多名学生。
    一九六三年十一月，奈温军人政府可耻地破坏了和平谈判以后，又解散了各个合法党派，逮捕了一千多名进步人士。从那时到现在仍然在不断地逮捕工人、农民、学生、作家和企业主。这一切事实说明什么呢？它说明奈温是在缅甸实行军事独裁的缅甸的蒋介石。
    人民已经深深的感到，不管是文化、卫生、经济，不管什么问题，奈温军人政府都无法解决。情况越来越恶化。
    因此，人民已经看穿了奈温的“缅甸社会主义纲领”是假的。奈温是骗不了人的！因此，奈温也暴露了他的真面目，赫鲁晓夫、柯西金、勃列日涅夫也在缅甸人民中间暴露了他们的真面目，中国的赫鲁晓夫也暴露了他的真面目。
    同志们，对我们来说，这是很清楚的。
    从来也没有听说过，依靠美帝国主义的援助能够建立社会主义。但是，奈温、赫鲁晓夫，以及中国的赫鲁晓夫这一伙人却说可以，并且在缅甸进行试验。
    我再谈一谈奈温军人政府的经济危机。
    奈温的“缅甸社会主义纲领”早已给全国带来了严重的经济危机。现在，食品和医药奇缺，价格高昂，投机商人集团和黑市很多，以至于奈温都穷于应付。原因是奈温的军官和文职官员都参加了黑市活动。
    关于物资缺乏的情况，我想举几个例子说明一下。
    现在，缅甸的食油非常缺乏，炒菜没有油。缅甸老百姓把没有放油的菜或只放很少一点油的菜叫做“奈温菜”。
    现在，缅甸的饥荒是非常严重的。
    缅甸是世界上生产大米最多的国家之一。即使在第二次世界大战期间，那时全国都变成了战场，但是，缅甸人民依靠自力更生，没有发生饥荒。
    战前，缅甸除了国内消费以外，每年可以出口大米三百万吨；现在，只能出口六十万吨大米，国内只能以牛奶空罐量米计售。
    在奈温统治下出现了饥荒。政府宣布，在今年十一月份和十二月份以前，缅甸可能没有粮食了。因此，要求老百姓节约用粮。但是，饥荒现在已经开始了。工人因为没有饭吃，离开了工厂；农民因为吃不饱饭，无法下地干活。已经出现了吃草根树皮的现象。营养缺乏，疾病丛生。
    已经出现了要求解决粮食问题的示威斗争。缅甸首都仰光，每人每天只能买到一牛奶罐大米。达克达区的一千多名居民因为晚饭无米下炊，集体到粮店示威。在仰光，有的饭馆已经出现只卖菜不卖饭的现象。
    全国人民对奈温军人政府已经感到无比愤怒。
    奈温军人政府为了摆脱政治的、军事的、经济的危机，为了巩固自己的统治，采取了卑鄙的手法。他们挑起了中缅的民族冲突，企图把缅甸人民象火山那样爆发出来的怒火引向民族冲突。
    大家已经知道，奈温军人政府是从残酷屠杀华侨学生和华侨开始的，他们首先制造谣言，挑起民族仇恨，然后，挑起了民族冲突。他们这些卑鄙的阴谋也许能够取得暂时成功。但是，长期以来建立起来的中缅友谊是巩固的，是任何人也破坏不了的。世界上任何力量都破坏不了这个友谊。企图破坏这个友谊的人，只能象疯子拿头撞墙一样，碰得头破血流。
    毛主席教导我们说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”奈温反华，就是“搬起石头打自己的脚”。
    第二次世界大战以前，英帝国主义曾经挑起过中缅冲突。除此以外，中缅友谊是巩固的，它是一种亲如骨肉的友谊。缅甸人把中国人称为“胞波”，意思就是亲戚。当然，奈温也把中国的赫鲁晓夫叫着“胞波”。这个“胞波”是他们一伙的“胞波”，而不是人民之间的“胞波”，只能是祖师爷和门徒之间的“胞波”。
    因此，我们相信，在真正巩固的中缅友好精神指导下，而不是奈温和中国的赫鲁晓夫的虚伪的那一套，那么，缅甸华侨的斗争一定会取得胜利。
    我顺便讲一件事。
    各国反动派说，有两种共产党。他们说，他们不怕赫鲁晓夫、柯西金、勃列日涅夫的共产党，他们可以同这样的共产党交朋友。他们对中国的赫鲁晓夫那样的共产党人也采取这种态度。但是，他们对毛泽东的共产党却怕得发抖。
    敌人的这个分析非常重要。我们都应该做毛泽东式的共产党。
    高举“生的伟大，死的光荣”这一毛主席教导而斗争的缅甸华侨一定胜利。
    缅甸人民一定很快结束这场屠杀，团结一致，反对奈温。
    反对中国人民和缅甸人民的奈温军人政府必败。
    镇压中国无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵的中国的赫鲁晓夫，在群众中已经抬不起头了；因为害怕中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响，害怕缅甸的革命力量，而镇压华侨的奈温军人政府必败。
    反对毛主席思想的中国的赫鲁晓夫已经威信扫地；侮辱毛主席的奈温军人政府也一定失败。
    我们一定同中国人民一起，把反对奈温军人政府的斗争，把反对修正主义的斗争，把反对各国反动派的斗争进行到底。
    我们一定在实际工作中对奈温军人政府加强斗争。
    让美帝国主义和苏联修正主义给奈温军人政府更多的援助吧。
    不管要忍受多大的牺牲，不管要进行多长的斗争，我们一定斗争下去。
    我们已经经历了近二十年的军事斗争。我们认为，有毛主席的思想做我们的指南，什么敌人我们都不怕。
    我们一定彻底打倒奈温军人政府，建立一个持久和平的、幸福的、完全独立的缅甸，建立一个符合人民意志的人民民主统一阵线政府。
    让我们在毛主席思想的旗帜下，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
    我们完全支持缅甸华侨兄弟的革命的、英勇的、正义的斗争！中缅友谊是任何人破坏不了的！
    奈温军人反动政府必败！
    人民民主革命必胜！
    缅中两国人民的团结万岁！
    缅甸共产党和中国共产党的团结万岁！
    无产阶级国际主义万岁！
    毛主席亲自领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    马克思列宁主义毛泽东思想万岁！
    美帝必败！
    以苏共领导为首的现代修正主义必败！
    敬祝缅甸共产党主席德钦丹东同志身体健康！
    世界人民伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！（附图片）
