Recently, the Soviet revisionist clique unilaterally tore up the agreement, demanding that Chinese citizens entering the Soviet Union present smallpox and cholera vaccination certificates, thereby slandering China as a smallpox and cholera epidemic area.

Not long ago, U.S. imperialism pretended to "suggest" selling epidemic prevention drugs to China, slandering China as an epidemic area. The Soviet revisionists followed closely, maliciously announcing in the United Nations World Health Organization that the agreement between China and the Soviet Union to mutually waive smallpox vaccination certificates is invalid, using this to slander China as an epidemic area. This shows that the Soviet revisionist clique and U.S. imperialism are in close coordination in their common anti-China efforts, singing in unison and working together.

Since liberation, our people, under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, have made great strides in politics, economy, culture, education, and medical and health care. Diseases that harm people's health have long been eradicated. Take smallpox as an example; since it was eliminated in 1955, smallpox has not spread in our country again. This is a well-known fact that neither U.S. imperialism nor the Soviet revisionists, nor their big and small running dogs, can erase.

People are well aware that in December 1959, smallpox broke out in the Soviet Union. On May 28, 1960, the Soviet Minister of Health, Mikhkin, sent a letter to our Ministry of Health, requesting that China cancel the requirement for Soviet citizens entering China to be vaccinated against smallpox. The letter read: "Moscow eradicated smallpox in January this year. In view of this, we request that the requirement for Soviet citizens entering China to be vaccinated against smallpox be canceled." After that, in order to promote friendship between the peoples of China and the Soviet Union, we agreed to the Soviet side's suggestion and signed the Agreement on Mutual Waiver of Smallpox Vaccination Certificates between China and the Soviet Union in May 1960.

The Soviet revisionist clique, in order to oppose China and attack China's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has racked its brains to spread rumors about China, vigorously propagating the so-called "chaos" in China's politics and the "collapse" of its economic life. U.S. imperialism also sings the same tune, shouting that China will experience major economic turmoil. These two anti-China rumor companies work together, stirring up trouble, and attempt to portray China as a place of utter chaos and disorder.

However, China's successful hydrogen bomb test, with the force of a thousand thunderclaps, declared to the world the great victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, sweeping away all the slanders about China's "chaos" and "collapse." The Soviet revisionist clique, stunned, could only seek refuge in invisible and untouchable bacteria and viruses, following the American plague god, and staged an anti-China farce of slandering China as an epidemic area. The Soviet revisionist clique's despicable tactics precisely exposed that its anti-China rumors have reached the point of exhaustion and complete bankruptcy.

The Soviet revisionist clique unilaterally tore up the agreement and on June 27 notified our country of this decision. The notification said that starting from July 1, all Chinese citizens entering the Soviet border must present international smallpox and cholera vaccination certificates. Anyone with a bit of health knowledge knows that smallpox vaccination takes 14 days to take effect, while cholera takes 6 days. It is impossible to complete the vaccination in four days. The Soviet revisionist clique, in its eagerness to oppose China, has even forgotten basic health knowledge. In fact, this amnesia is not without cause. The Soviet revisionist clique's slander of China as a smallpox and cholera epidemic area coincided with the Soviet leader Khrushchev's embrace of Johnson, intensifying Soviet-American collusion. This shows that as the Soviet revisionist clique becomes more brazen in its betrayal of the peoples of the world and the Soviet Union, they will inevitably use even more frenzied anti-China rumors to confuse people's vision and cover up their traitorous faces. However, no matter how absurd the Soviet revisionist clique's anti-China rumors become, they will not harm a single hair of the great Chinese people, but will only expose the ugliness of the rumor-mongers.

Lenin once pointed out the fate of these political gamblers who live by spreading rumors: "Lying is moral decay, and it inevitably leads to political decay." The fate of Brezhnev, Kosygin, and their ilk will not be better than that of Bernstein, Kautsky, and Khrushchev.

    黔驴技穷
    中国医科大学　红卫兵
    最近，苏修集团片面撕毁协议，要求由中国进入苏联国境的公民出示天花、霍乱预防接种证书，借以污蔑中国为天花、霍乱疫区。
    不久前，美帝国主义装腔作势地“建议”卖防疫药品给中国，污蔑中国为疫区。苏修紧紧跟上，恶毒地在联合国世界卫生组织宣布，中苏互相免验天花预防接种证书协议无效，借此污蔑中国为疫区。足见苏修集团同美帝国主义在共同反华上此唱彼和，配合密切。
    解放后，我国人民在伟大领袖毛主席的英明领导下，在政治、经济、文教、医药卫生各条战线上一日千里地朝前迈进。为害人民健康的各种瘟疫病早已绝迹。就以天花为例，我国天花疫病自从一九五五年消灭以后，就再也没有流行过，这是人所共知的事实。不论美帝也罢，苏修也罢，以及他们的大小走狗也罢，都是无法抹杀的。
    人们都清楚知道，一九五九年十二月，天花在苏联流行过。一九六○年五月二十八日，苏联卫生部副部长米基金给我国卫生部来了一封信，请求我国取消赴华苏联公民必须接种天花的规定。这封信是这样写的：“莫斯科在今年一月份消灭了天花，鉴此我们请求能取消赴华苏联公民必须进行天花预防接种的规定。”这以后，我们为了促进中苏两国人民的友谊，答应了苏方的建议，在一九六○年五月签订了中苏互相免验天花预防接种证书协议。
    苏修集团为了反华，为了攻击中国的无产阶级文化大革命，挖空心思造中国的谣，竭力宣传什么中国政治上的“混乱”和经济生活的“解体”。美帝国主义也同苏修集团唱一个调调，叫嚷中国“将发生大的经济骚乱”。这两家反华造谣公司通力合作，兴风作浪，妄图把中国说成漆黑一团，混乱不堪。
    可是，中国氢弹爆炸成功，以千钧霹雳之势，向全世界宣告了战无不胜的毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命的伟大胜利，把那些污蔑中国“混乱”、“解体”的鬼话一扫而光。目瞪口呆的苏修集团，只好向看不见、摸不着的细菌、病毒求救，跟在美国瘟神后面，搞出了一出污蔑中国为疫区的反华小合唱。苏修集团这种卑劣手法，恰恰暴露了它的反华造谣已经黔驴技穷，彻底破产。
    苏修集团片面撕毁协议，在六月二十七日把这个决定通知我国。通知说，凡七月一日起进入苏联边境的中国公民必须出示天花、霍乱国际预防接种证书。一个稍有卫生常识的人都知道，天花预防接种要十四天才开始有效，而霍乱是六天。在四天的时间里进行预防接种是无论如何也来不及的。苏修集团反华心切竟连一般的卫生常识都忘记了。其实这种健忘症不是没有原因的，苏修集团污蔑中国为天花、霍乱疫区，正好发生在苏修头子柯西金投进约翰逊怀抱、大搞美苏勾结的时候。这就表明随着苏修集团更加露骨地叛卖全世界人民和苏联人民，他们必然要用加倍疯狂的反华造谣来混淆人们的视听，遮掩自己的叛徒面目。但是，无论苏修集团的反华造谣达到怎样荒唐的地步，绝对损伤不了伟大中国人民的一根毫毛，而只能使造谣者更加暴露自己的丑恶嘴脸。
    列宁曾经给这些靠造谣过日子的政治赌棍指出了前途：“撒谎是道义上的灭亡，也势必引向政治上的灭亡。”勃列日涅夫、柯西金之流的下场决不会比伯恩施坦、考茨基以及赫鲁晓夫好些。
