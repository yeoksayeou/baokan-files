The Ne Win reactionary government is irrationally obstructing and harassing victimized overseas Chinese in handling their repatriation procedures. The Chinese Embassy in Burma has once again lodged the strongest protest.

If the Burmese reactionary government continues to act unilaterally, it must bear the serious consequences that arise from this.

	New China News Agency, July 25th: Yangon news: On the 20th, the Chinese Embassy in Burma sent a note to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, strongly protesting the Ne Win reactionary government's obstruction and harassment of patriotic overseas Chinese who are eager to return to their homeland and obtain passports and visas from the Chinese Embassy.

	The note pointed out: "Overseas Chinese coming to the embassy to obtain passports and handle visas is their legal right, and no one can deprive them of it. The consular department of the embassy interacting with overseas Chinese is a matter of course, and your Burmese reactionary government has no right to interfere. Your actions, which violate diplomatic customs and the most basic principles of international relations, only further expose you as a bunch of bloodthirsty devils who are afraid of the sun. You will surely face severe punishment from the Chinese people and the people of the world."

	The note said that due to the anti-China, anti-Chinese fascist atrocities planned by the Burmese reactionary government, tens of thousands of patriotic overseas Chinese have been destroyed, homeless, and displaced. A large number of patriotic overseas Chinese urgently request to return to their homeland and firmly demand to come to the Chinese Embassy to obtain passports and handle visas, but they are obstructed and harassed in every way by your military, police, and secret agents and cannot come to the embassy. Some overseas Chinese who come to the embassy to handle visas and obtain passports are blocked back three times in a row by your secret agents; some are taken away by your military and police for so-called "interrogation"; some are even illegally arrested and detained, causing these patriotic overseas Chinese to continue to suffer from your fascist torture and persecution, with their lives in danger.

	The note said that you have already killed a large number of patriotic overseas Chinese, and their bodies are not yet cold, but you, this bunch of bloodthirsty fascist thugs, are plotting even greater massacres. A large number of overseas Chinese have been harmed by you, their lives are in danger at any time, and now they want to return to their own homeland, but you obstruct and block them in every way. What are your intentions? Are you determined to kill all the patriotic overseas Chinese? If you have the guts, announce this decision to the Burmese people, announce it to the people of the world, you dare not! You are originally fascists, but you pretend to be philanthropists to deceive the world, this is intolerable! After killing countless patriotic overseas Chinese, you hypocritically publish a few pictures of treating overseas Chinese well in the newspapers, trying to deceive the world, which is extremely despicable!

	The note said that the Chinese Embassy has repeatedly made representations and protests to you regarding this reasonable demand, but you have completely ignored it.

	The note finally said: If the Burmese reactionary government dares to ignore the legitimate demands and serious warnings of the Chinese Embassy and continues to act unilaterally and commit crimes, then the Burmese reactionary government must bear all the serious consequences that arise from this.

    奈温反动政府无理阻挠和刁难受害华侨办理回国手续
    我驻缅使馆再次提出最强烈抗议
    如缅甸反动政府继续一意孤行必须承担由此引起的严重后果
    新华社二十五日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆二十日照会缅甸外交部，再次最强烈地抗议奈温反动政府阻挠和刁难急于返回祖国的受害爱国华侨到中国大使馆领护照，办理签证的罪恶行径。
    照会指出：“华侨到大使馆领护照，办证是他们的合法权利，任何人不能剥夺。大使馆领事部门接触华侨是天经地义的事，你们缅甸反动政府根本无权干涉。你们这种破坏外交惯例，违反国际关系起码准则的行径，只能更加暴露你们是一群吃人的魔鬼，但又害怕太阳。你们一定会受到中国人民和世界人民的严厉惩罚。”
    照会说，由于缅甸反动政府策划的反华、排华法西斯暴行，使成千上万的爱国华侨家破人亡，流离失所，大批爱国华侨急于要求返回祖国，坚决要求来中国大使馆领护照，办理签证，但被你们的军警特务百般阻挠刁难，不能来大使馆。有的华侨来大使馆办证、领护照被你们的特务一连三次挡回；有的被你们的军警传去“问话”，进行所谓“审查”；有的竟被你们非法逮捕，关押，使这些爱国华侨又继续遭到你们法西斯的虐待和迫害，生命危在旦夕。
    照会说，你们已经杀害了大批爱国华侨，他们尸骨未寒，你们这群嗜血成性的法西斯暴徒又在酝酿更大规模的屠杀。大批华侨被你们害得生活无着，生命随时受到威胁，现在他们要返回自己的祖国你们又百般刁难，多方阻拦，你们究竟居心何在？你们是不是决定要把广大爱国华侨杀尽而后快？如果有胆量，就把你们这一强盗决定宣告缅甸人民，宣告世界人民，你们不敢！你们本来是法西斯，又偏要装成慈善家来欺骗世人，是可忍，孰不可忍？你们屠杀无数爱国华侨之后，又在报上假惺惺地刊出几张优待华侨的图片，企图骗过世人耳目，真是可恶之极！
    照会说，中国大使馆为此，曾一再向你们提出交涉和抗议，但你们对这一合理要求置若罔闻。
    照会最后说：如果缅甸反动政府竟敢不顾中国大使馆的正当要求和严重警告，一意孤行，继续犯罪，那么，缅甸反动政府必须承担由此而引起的一切严重后果。
