The South Vietnamese Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe Visits and Performs in Beijing

Members of the troupe recite Chairman Mao's quotations and sing "The Ship Needs a Helmsman" during their visit

According to a report by Xinhua News Agency, the South Vietnamese Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe visited the large clay sculpture "The Rent Collection Courtyard" and the large photographic exhibition "Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts" on July 4th and 5th, respectively. They were warmly welcomed by the broad masses of revolutionary rebels and revolutionary spectators.

During the visit to the photographic exhibition, when the South Vietnamese comrades saw the great historical moment of China's most beloved great leader Chairman Mao standing on the Tiananmen Gate Tower to receive the Red Guards, the guide said, "Long live Chairman Mao forever!" They applauded enthusiastically. When they saw the photo of Chairman Mao receiving the South Vietnamese female heroine Xie Shijiao, many people jumped for joy and applauded enthusiastically again and again.

During the visit to "The Rent Collection Courtyard," the South Vietnamese cultural warriors, with boundless admiration, recited Chairman Mao's quotations with the audience in front of Chairman Mao's portrait. When they saw the evil landlord Liu Wenhai brutally oppressing the peasants, they shouted in unison, "Down with the evil landlords!"

The cultural warriors of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe also sang Chinese songs such as "The Ship Needs a Helmsman," "On the Golden Mountain in Beijing," and "A Portrait for the Female Militia" with more than 100 young Red Guards from the capital.

On the evening of July 5th, the Foreign Affairs Committee hosted a reception for the South Vietnamese Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe at the Capital Theater, inviting diplomats and foreign friends from various countries stationed in China.

The cultural warriors from the front lines of the anti-American struggle in South Vietnam performed songs praising Chairman Ho Chi Minh's leadership of the Vietnamese people's revolutionary struggle and songs and dances reflecting the heroic deeds of the South Vietnamese military and people in their struggle against American aggression. They also sang Chinese songs in Chinese, including "The East Is Red," "The Ship Needs a Helmsman," "Long Live Chairman Mao," and other revolutionary songs. These performances were warmly received.
