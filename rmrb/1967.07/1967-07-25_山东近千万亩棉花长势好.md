	Shandong Province's nearly ten million mu of cotton is currently in full bloom and setting buds, growing vigorously.

	The excellent situation in Shandong's cotton production this year is the result of the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in various cotton-producing areas, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, firmly carrying out Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production." Shortly after the establishment of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, to ensure the cotton production is on track, a provincial cotton production conference was held in early April. After this conference, the revolutionary masses and cadres in the cotton-producing areas, with the strong support of the People's Liberation Army, displayed a tenacious fighting spirit, overcame the severe drought this spring, and completed and exceeded the sowing plan in a timely manner.

	Currently, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres in various cotton-producing areas have launched a new high tide of mass efforts to focus on the mid-term management of cotton, determined to achieve a bumper cotton harvest.

    山东近千万亩棉花长势好
    据新华社济南电　山东省九百八十多万亩棉花，目前已经普遍开花结蕾，长势喜人。
    山东今年棉花生产的大好形势，是各棉区贫下中农和革命干部，在中国人民解放军的大力支持下，坚决贯彻毛主席“抓革命，促生产”伟大号召的结果。山东省革命委员会成立不久，为了把棉花生产抓紧，在四月初召开了全省棉花生产会议。这次会议开过后，棉区广大革命群众和革命干部，在人民解放军的大力支持下，以顽强斗争精神，战胜了今春的严重干旱，适时地完成和超额完成了播种计划。
    当前，各产棉区的贫下中农和革命干部，掀起一个群众性的狠抓棉花中期管理的新高潮，誓夺棉花大丰收。
