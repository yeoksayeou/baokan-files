	Longing for Chairman Mao Day and Night

	“Chairman Mao, I have seen you!”
	One day, a group of Syrian students boarded the Chinese ocean-going cargo ship “Tangshan,” which was docked in the port of Latakia and had specially brought rice for the Syrian people. They had traveled all the way from the capital Damascus, over three hundred kilometers away. They entered the ship's cabin and saw a large portrait of the great leader Chairman Mao hanging in the reception room. A female teacher joyfully exclaimed, “Chairman Mao! Chairman Mao! I have seen you today.” She told the Chinese sailors that she was very eager to read Chairman Mao’s works and to obtain a Chairman Mao badge. The Chinese sailors gave her a Chairman Mao badge and two of Chairman Mao’s works, but she still did not leave, insisting on getting a Little Red Book. After a sailor gave her a French edition of “Quotations from Chairman Mao,” she happily left. The students saw a photograph of Chairman Mao conducting a survey in the countryside hanging in the engine room’s dining hall and were moved to say, “Chairman Mao is so humble!” Some even took photographs of Chairman Mao’s portrait.

	Heart-Stirring Songs

	In the still night sky, on the seashore of Zanzibar Island covered with palm trees, a series of heart-stirring songs could be heard. The singer, using not very fluent Chinese, sang passionately, “The loudest song is ‘The East Is Red,’ the greatest leader is Mao Zedong. Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong, you are the sun in the hearts of the world’s people, you are the guiding light for human liberation…”

	The song came from the home of a Zanzibar youth.

	That day, he had just learned this song praising Chairman Mao from a Chinese friend during the day. In the evening, he returned home and sang it over and over again. This Zanzibar youth who loved to sing especially liked to sing songs praising Chairman Mao and songs from the “Quotations from Chairman Mao.”

	At a gathering with Chinese friends, everyone welcomed him to sing. He stood up and said with great enthusiasm, “Chairman Mao is the great leader of the world’s revolutionary people. Before I sing this song praising Chairman Mao, I must first shout: Long live the great teacher, great leader, great commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao!” Then he sang loudly, “Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman.”

	The Chinese friends present on this distant East African island heard the African friend’s enthusiastic singing and felt extremely close and excited.

	Delighted to Receive the Red Book

	One day, a young student of about ten years old went to the Chinese Embassy in Yugoslavia to request a copy of “Quotations from Chairman Mao” and was immediately stopped by Yugoslavian police. At this moment, a Chinese comrade stepped forward. The brave young boy, in the presence of the police, fearlessly told the Chinese comrade, “I want the Red Book!” Seeing the embassy staff present, the police awkwardly slipped away to the other side of the street. When he was a short distance away, the young boy earnestly told the Chinese comrade, “Someone asked me to come and get a Red Book.” After the Chinese comrade fulfilled the young boy’s wish, he happily took the bright red “Quotations from Chairman Mao” and hurried away.

	Seeing Chairman Mao in the Movies

	Not long ago, nearly two thousand French progressive individuals and overseas Chinese residing in France attended a film screening hosted by the Chinese Embassy in France, where they watched the Chinese large-scale color documentary “Chairman Mao is the Red Sun in Our Hearts” and “The Great Victory of Mao Zedong Thought.”

	During the film screening, the audience enthusiastically and excitedly expressed their sincere feelings of love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought. They applauded over a hundred times.

	A French heating equipment worker, after watching the film, said, “Chairman Mao is also the red sun in my heart, the person I respect the most.” He said, “I saw from the film the genuine proletarian feelings between Chairman Mao and the working masses, and the boundless love of the Chinese people for the great party and leader. This made me deeply feel that the Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought can accomplish anything.”

　　日夜想念毛主席
    “毛主席，我看到您了！”
    有一天，一批叙利亚学生到停泊在拉塔基亚港的专程为叙利亚人民运来大米的中国远洋货轮“唐山”轮上要求参观。他们是特地从三百多公里外的首都大马士革赶来的。他们走进船舱，看到船舱的会客室里挂着伟大领袖毛主席的巨幅照片。一位女教师高兴地欢呼起来：“毛主席！毛主席！我今天看到您了。”她对中国海员说，她非常渴望能读到毛主席的著作，和得到一枚毛主席像章。中国海员送了她一枚毛主席像章和两篇毛主席的著作，但她仍然不走，坚持要得到一本小红书。一个海员送给她一本法文《毛主席语录》后，她才高兴地离开了。学生们看见在轮机部餐厅挂着的毛主席在农村进行调查时的照片，感动地说：“毛主席真谦虚啊！”有的人还把毛主席的照片拍了照。
    激动人心的歌声
    寂静的夜空，在椰林覆盖的桑给巴尔岛海滨，传来一阵阵激动人心的歌声。歌唱者用不太熟练的中国话纵情高唱着：“最响亮的歌是东方红，最伟大的领袖是毛泽东。毛泽东，毛泽东，您是世界人民心中的太阳，您是人类解放的指路明灯……”。
    这歌声是从一位桑给巴尔青年的住屋里传出来的。
    那天，他白天刚从中国朋友那里学会了这首颂扬毛主席的歌，晚上回到家里便一遍一遍地尽情歌唱起来。这位喜爱唱歌的桑给巴尔青年特别爱唱颂扬毛主席的歌和毛主席语录歌。
    在一次同中国朋友联欢的会上，人们欢迎他唱歌。他站起来满腔热情地说：“毛主席是世界革命人民的伟大领袖，我在唱这首颂扬毛主席的歌之前首先要高呼：伟大的导师、伟大的领袖、伟大的统帅、伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！”然后他放声高唱《大海航行靠舵手》。
    在座的中国朋友在这个远离祖国的东非海岛听到非洲朋友这种热情洋溢的歌声，都感到无比亲切和激动。
    得到红书心欢喜
    一天，一个十多岁的小学生到中国驻南斯拉夫大使馆索取《毛主席语录》，当即被南斯拉夫警察拦住。正在这时，中国同志走上前去。这位勇敢的少年，当着警察的面毫不畏惧地对中国同志说：“我要红书！”警察看到我使馆人员在场，便尴尬地向马路对面溜去。当他离开不远，这位少年恳切地对中国同志说：“有人托我前来要一本红书”。中国同志满足了这位少年的愿望后，他非常高兴地带着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》匆匆而去。
    在电影中看到了毛主席
    不久前，将近两千名法国和旅居法国的外国进步人士以及华侨，在中国驻法国大使馆举办的电影招待会上，看了中国大型彩色纪录片《毛主席是我们心中的红太阳》和《毛泽东思想的伟大胜利》。
    在电影放映时，观众热烈和激动地表达了他们无限热爱毛主席和毛泽东思想的真挚感情，他们热烈鼓掌有上百次之多。
    一个法国暖气设备工人看了电影后说：“毛主席也是我心中的红太阳，是我心中最崇敬的人。”他说：“我从影片上看到了毛主席和劳动群众之间的真正的无产阶级感情，看到了中国人民对伟大的党和领袖的无比热爱。这使我深深感觉到，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，什么事都办得到。”
