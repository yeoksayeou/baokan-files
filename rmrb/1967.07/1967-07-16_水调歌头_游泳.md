Just having drunk the waters of Changsha, now I eat the fish of Wuchang. Crossing the ten thousand li of the Yangtze River, gazing far into the sky of Chu. No matter how the wind blows or the waves crash, it is like a leisurely stroll in the courtyard. Today, I have the leisure. As Confucius said by the river: "The passing of time is like this!"

The wind sways the sails, the turtles and snakes are still, and great plans are being made. A bridge spans north and south, turning a natural barrier into a thoroughfare. Additionally, erecting a stone wall in the west of the Xiang River, cutting off the clouds and rain of Wushan, creating a vast lake from the high gorges. The spirit of the goddess should be well, and the world will be astonished by the change.

    水调歌头  游泳
    才饮长沙水，又食武昌鱼。万里长江横渡，极目楚天舒。不管风吹浪打，胜似闲庭信步，今日得宽余。子在川上曰：逝者如斯夫！　风樯动，龟蛇静，起宏图。一桥飞架南北，天堑变通途。更立西江石壁，截断巫山云雨，高峡出平湖。神女应无恙，当惊世界殊。
