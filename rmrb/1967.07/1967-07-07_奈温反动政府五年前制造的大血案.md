Answer: The bloody incident perpetrated by the Ne Win reactionary government five years ago is a grave crime committed by the Ne Win clique after they seized power through a military coup and imposed fascist rule.

The sequence of events is as follows:

On July 7, 1962, over four thousand students from Rangoon University held a demonstration and march, strongly protesting against the reactionary authorities' unreasonable ban on students leaving their dormitories at night. However, their legitimate demand was not only ignored but met with brutal suppression. The Ne Win reactionary government, under the pretext that the student demonstration was "instigated by the Communists," dispatched a large number of armed military police to Rangoon University. They not only openly blew up the student union building but also indiscriminately sprayed machine-gun fire, killing over a hundred university students on the spot and injuring over three hundred, turning the entire Rangoon University into a blood-soaked slaughterhouse. Two days later, the Ne Win reactionary government, under the pretext of "implementing a new educational system," ordered the closure of all colleges and universities. They also arbitrarily stipulated that from then on, students seeking admission must submit a written guarantee signed by their parents, to be vetted by the authorities before admission.

The savage crime committed by the Ne Win reactionary government fully exposed their fascist dictatorial rule and the evil nature of their regime, leaving a debt of blood to the Burmese people.

　　奈温反动政府五年前制造的大血案
    问：七月二日报上刊登的缅共中央声明中提到，一九六二年七月七日缅甸反动政府曾在仰光制造了枪杀一百多名大学生的大血案，究竟是怎么回事，希予解答。
                                      北京一红卫兵
    答：奈温反动政府五年前制造的这个血腥事件，是奈温集团发动军事政变上台以后实行法西斯专政的一个严重罪行。
    事件的经过是这样的：
    一九六二年七月七日，仰光大学的四千多名学生举行示威游行，强烈抗议反动当局无理禁止学生夜间离开自己宿舍的法西斯规章。但是，他们的这个正当要求不但没有得到满足，反而遭到残暴的镇压。奈温反动政府借口所谓学生示威是“共产党煽动的”，出动大批武装军警前往仰光大学。他们不但公然炸毁学生会大楼，而且用机枪疯狂扫射，当场就杀死一百多名大学生，打伤三百多名，使整个仰光大学成为一个血流遍地的屠场。两天以后，奈温反动政府又借口“实行新的教育制度”，下令关闭所有大专学校；并且无理规定，以后学生入学，必须递交由父母签字的书面保证，经由当局甄别才能入学。
    奈温反动政府的这个野蛮罪行，充分暴露了它实行法西斯独裁统治的罪恶面目，对缅甸人民欠下了一笔血债。
