The great Chinese People's Liberation Army is celebrating its 40th anniversary. In the context of the great victory of the Cultural Revolution, we commemorate the founding of the army and its glorious, victorious history with pride.

The Chinese People's Liberation Army is a great army personally founded by our great leader Chairman Mao, directly commanded by Comrade Lin Biao, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, and truly in the hands of the people. It is an unparalleled, most powerful revolutionary army.

Over the past 40 years, under the leadership of the great commander Chairman Mao, the Chinese People's Liberation Army has grown from small to large, from weak to strong. Through arduous struggle and heroic sacrifice, it has smashed the five major encirclement campaigns launched by the reactionary Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek, successfully completed the famous Long March of 25,000 li, defeated the arrogant Japanese invaders, annihilated the eight million reactionary Kuomintang troops armed by American imperialism, and in the Korean War, together with the Korean people, defeated the most ferocious aggression by the United States and its 14 allied countries. The great Chinese People's Liberation Army is a revolutionary flower nurtured by the blood of countless revolutionary martyrs, a pride and glory of the Chinese people and the people of the world. It is not only the pillar of the proletarian dictatorship in our country but also a strong backbone for the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world.

In August 1927, after the Kuomintang completely betrayed the revolution, under the leadership of Chairman Mao, who represented the correct line, defeating the right-opportunist line of Chen Duxiu, and guided by Mao Zedong Thought, the Nanchang Uprising fired the first shot against the Kuomintang reactionaries. In September, our great leader Chairman Mao personally led the peasant uprising in Hunan, launching the great Autumn Harvest Uprising with profound historical significance, and establishing the Jinggangshan base area. The Chinese people began armed struggle under the leadership of the correct line, and for the first time had a completely new type of people's army.

"Red flags rise, serfs' spears unfurl." The Autumn Harvest Uprising and the great march to Jinggangshan have epoch-making significance in the history of the Chinese revolution and the history of the founding of our army. From then on, the proletarian vanguard opened up the revolutionary path of deepening into the countryside, leading the peasants in armed struggle, establishing rural base areas, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and seizing national power.

Chairman Mao's brilliant thought of surrounding the cities from the countryside and seizing power through armed struggle is a genius development of Marxism-Leninism. It not only opened up the only correct path to national victory for the Chinese people but also pointed out the broad road to true liberation for the proletariat and oppressed people of the whole world.

Chairman Mao said: "The army is the main component of state power. Whoever wants to seize state power and wants to maintain it must have a strong army." The exploiting classes always rely on violence to maintain their rule and carry out cruel exploitation and plunder of the people. If the exploited classes show the slightest resistance, they are subjected to bloody suppression by the reactionary army. The reactionaries hold knives, and the revolutionary people must also pick up knives. The highest form of class struggle is war. If you do not grasp the gun, do not use revolutionary armed forces to oppose counter-revolutionary armed forces, the people will not be able to rise up. Without the people's army, all resistance of the people will have no hope of victory. Even if some achievements are temporarily gained, as long as the enemy carries out armed suppression, everything will become a bubble.

The greatest crime of the revisionists is to oppose the people's armed struggle and oppose the proletariat grasping the gun. The old revisionists Bernstein and Kautsky are like this, and the modern revisionists Khrushchev, Thorez, Togliatti, Togliatti, Dange, and Nambudripad are also like this.

The biggest capitalist-roaders within the Chinese party, like all counter-revolutionary revisionists, have always opposed armed struggle and advocated the parliamentary road, promoting capitulationism. During the Anti-Japanese War, they shamelessly praised Chiang Kai-shek as the "revolutionary flag" and advocated handing over the people's army to Chiang Kai-shek's "national government" for "leadership." After the victory of the Anti-Japanese War, they openly advocated handing over the people's army to the Kuomintang reactionaries.

Chairman Mao thoroughly criticized the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of not having a people's army and not carrying out armed struggle. Under the wise leadership of Chairman Mao, the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army adhered to the path of armed struggle and achieved victory in the democratic revolution, establishing a great state of proletarian dictatorship.

In the long-term revolutionary wars, Chairman Mao created the most complete, most scientific, and greatest military theory. In the resolutions of the Guttian Conference and other series of military works, Chairman Mao formulated a truly proletarian military line. This is the highest peak of Marxism-Leninism military thought. This is the most powerful weapon for the revolutionary people of the world to defeat imperialism and all class enemies.

Chairman Mao said: "The whole world can only be transformed by the gun." This is the summary of the experience gained by the Chinese proletariat and the world proletariat with their blood. This is a universal truth of Marxism-Leninism. This truth is increasingly being grasped by the proletariat and oppressed peoples and nations of the whole world. The revolutionary people in many regions of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are rising up, kicking out the opportunist leaders, bravely picking up the gun, establishing the people's army, and launching armed struggle, strongly opposing the imperialism led by the United States and all reactionaries, strongly opposing the modern revisionism centered on the Soviet Communist Party leadership, and engaging in a fierce and tenacious struggle against the old world.

Throughout the socialist period, class struggle is concentrated in the struggle between the bourgeoisie's restoration and the proletariat's anti-restoration. The bourgeoisie will definitely seize the army and the gun to carry out restoration. The proletariat must firmly grasp the gun and the army to consolidate the proletarian dictatorship and smash the bourgeoisie's restoration plots. After the proletariat seizes power, there is still the danger of losing power for a long historical period; similarly, after establishing the army, there is still the danger of losing the army. If the army is lost and the military power is usurped by bad people, then everything that the proletariat and the working people have fought for will be completely lost. The revisionist clique of Khrushchev in the Soviet Union usurped military power and carried out a counter-revolutionary coup, which is a serious lesson.

The biggest capitalist-roader within the party is the representative of the capitalist restoration forces. Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing are his agents in the army. Peng Dehuai is a great conspirator, a great ambitious person, and a great warlord. For decades, he has always stood on the reactionary bourgeois position, opposing Chairman Mao. In every struggle between the two lines, he has always stood on the opportunist side, opposing Chairman Mao's correct line. In 1953, he, together with Gao Gang and Rao Shushi, formed the Peng-Gao-Rao anti-party alliance. In 1959, he was again the leader of the anti-party clique exposed at the Party's Lushan Conference. Luo Ruiqing is also a bourgeois conspirator and ambitious person. As early as the Anti-Japanese War, he colluded with Peng Dehuai and Peng Zhen, opposed Chairman Mao, stubbornly carried out the capitulationist line of Wang Ming, and shamelessly praised the enemy of the people, Chiang Kai-shek, as the "supreme commander" of the Anti-Japanese War. After national victory, they further colluded, desperately seized the gun, promoted the bourgeois military line, and attempted to turn the people's army into a tool for counter-revolutionary restoration.

Mao Zedong Thought is the soul of our army, the infallible guide, and the fundamental guarantee that our army will never change. Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing and the like, in order to change the proletarian nature of our army and usurp military power, first directed their arrows at Mao Zedong Thought. Peng Dehuai viciously attacked, saying that "Chairman Mao's works can only be used as a reference and cannot be used as a guide for operations and training." Luo Ruiqing blathered that treating Chairman Mao's words as the highest directive "does not conform to our country's system." He also vigorously promoted the biggest capitalist-roader within the party's "Cultivation," praising this book as the "combination of Marxism-Leninism and Chinese revolutionary practice" and urging the entire army's cadres and soldiers to "study it well."

The attitude towards Mao Zedong Thought is the dividing line between Marxism-Leninism and counter-revolutionary revisionism. All the victories of our party and our army are the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought. The 40-year experience of our army tells us that without the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we will make mistakes, suffer setbacks, and fail. The army is a tool of class struggle. If it is not guided by proletarian thought, it will be guided by bourgeois thought. Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing and the like desperately oppose Mao Zedong Thought, wanting to use bourgeois thought and revisionist "Cultivation" to guide our army, wanting to turn our army into a bourgeois army.

Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing and other counter-revolutionary revisionists, in order to change the proletarian nature of our army and usurp military power, desperately opposed the prominence of proletarian politics and peddled a set of revisionist goods imported from abroad, advocating bourgeois regularization and opposing proletarian revolutionization. They put military technology in the first place and denied that political and ideological work is the primary factor determining combat effectiveness. Peng Dehuai blathered that "the quality of military training of the troops and the quality of military science learning of cadres at all levels are the basic standards for determining the high and low combat effectiveness of our army in the future." Luo Ruiqing used "big competitions" to impact politics and spread a set of opportunist, i.e., opportunist fallacies, opposing Comrade Lin Biao's instructions on the prominence of politics and the four firsts.

To believe that the basic standard for determining the high and low combat effectiveness of the army is military technology is a thorough bourgeois military viewpoint. What is the greatest combat effectiveness of our army? Is it the airplane? Is it the cannon? Is it the atomic bomb? No, it is absolutely not. The greatest combat effectiveness of our army is the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the revolutionary soldiers with high political awareness armed with Mao Zedong Thought. To oppose the prominence of proletarian politics and put military technology in the first place is to promote bourgeois politics. In fact, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing and the like have always opposed proletarian politics and promoted bourgeois reactionary politics. During the Anti-Japanese War, Peng Dehuai vigorously propagated the reactionary political views of "freedom, equality, and fraternity" of the bourgeoisie. Luo Ruiqing's book "Political Work in the Anti-Japanese Army" does not mention class struggle at all, does not mention the proletariat seizing power, and actually recognizes the enemy as the father, taking "the greatness of Chairman Chiang and his life" and Chiang Kai-shek's "wisdom, benevolence, and courage," "loyalty, filial piety, and love" as the basic content of army political work. What they propagate is completely the reactionary politics of the Kuomintang.

Under the support of the biggest capitalist-roader within the party, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing cultivated personal influence in the army, established personal prestige, recruited and accepted traitors, formed factions, and colluded with foreigners, conspiring to usurp the party and the army. Peng Dehuai gathered a small group of class enemies, opportunists, counter-revolutionaries, and untransformed old officers who had infiltrated the party, forming an anti-party clique and a counter-revolutionary "military club." Luo Ruiqing colluded with the counter-revolutionary revisionists Peng Zhen, Lu Dingyi, and Yang Shangkun, forming an anti-party conspiracy clique. They secretly promoted officials and made promises, striking down one group and raising another. They did all kinds of evil. They attempted to establish a reactionary bourgeois independent kingdom in the army. This small group of people deliberately opposed our great leader and great commander Chairman Mao and Comrade Lin Biao, who has always high-held the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought.

In short, the Chinese Khrushchev's agents in the military, Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, attempted to use a set of counter-revolutionary revisionist and bourgeois ideas to transform our army and usurp the leadership of the army. If their conspiracy succeeds and the gun is in their hands, our country will change color, and we will perish as a party, perish as a nation, and perish as individuals.

In the struggle to build our army into a highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready revolutionary army and in the struggle against the usurpation of the army by the bourgeois representatives Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, Comrade Lin Biao has made extremely outstanding contributions.

Comrade Lin Biao is Chairman Mao's closest comrade-in-arms and best student. Comrade Lin Biao has learned and used Chairman Mao's works the best, understood Mao Zedong Thought the deepest. For decades, he has always loyally, firmly, and thoroughly carried out and defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and military thought. In every struggle between the two lines, he has always stood firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's correct line. In works such as "Advancing with the Great Banner of the Party's General Line and Mao Zedong Military Thought" and "Long Live the Victory of the People's War" and a series of speeches, Comrade Lin Biao systematically expounded and creatively developed Chairman Mao's military thought.

Since Comrade Lin Biao took charge of the work of the Central Military Commission, he creatively proposed the thought of "four firsts," proposed to carry forward the spirit of the "Three-Eights," promote the three great democracies, and launch the "Four Good" campaign. The resolution on strengthening political and ideological work in the army made at the enlarged meeting of the Central Military Commission in 1960, based on Comrade Lin Biao's thought, inherited and carried forward the tradition of the Guttian Conference. Comrade Lin Biao's great call to all cadres and soldiers to "read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be a good soldier of Chairman Mao"; his proposed principles and methods for studying Chairman Mao's works with questions, learning and using them actively, combining learning and use, learning urgently what is needed immediately, and working hard on the use of words, have greatly promoted the entire army and the people of the whole country to grasp Mao Zedong Thought and achieve ideological revolutionization. The series of major measures proposed by Comrade Lin Biao to maintain the proletarian nature of our army have brought the construction of our army into a new stage.

Chairman Mao pointed out: The four firsts are good, this is a creation. The ideological and political work and military work of the Liberation Army, after Comrade Lin Biao proposed the four firsts and the spirit of the Three-Eights, have developed greatly compared to the past, becoming more concrete and more theoretical.

Comrade Lin Biao high-held the great red flag of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, thoroughly exposed and criticized the bourgeois military thought of Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, and firmly fought against their conspiracy to usurp the party and the army. To prevent capitalist restoration, Comrade Lin Biao particularly emphasized the importance of ideological struggle and the proletariat grasping the army. He pointed out: "The pen and the gun, seizing power relies on these two." "The bourgeoisie carries out subversive activities, also with ideology leading, first confusing people's minds. Another is to seize the army, grasp the gun. Literature and military work together, grasp public opinion and grasp the gun, they can carry out counter-revolutionary coups." This is a very important proposition. In the Cultural Revolution, we must expose the small group of capitalist-roaders within the party, and politically and ideologically fight them down and expose them. Similarly, we must also expose the small group of capitalist-roaders within the army, and politically and ideologically fight them down and expose them. These people are still struggling desperately. Not long ago, the small group of capitalist-roaders within the party and the army in the Wuhan area colluded to suppress the proletarian revolutionaries. This proves that we must further carry out a great criticism, thoroughly and cleanly sweep the small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the army into the garbage heap. Only in this way can we prevent capitalist restoration.

At present, a great criticism movement against the biggest small group of capitalist-roaders within the party and the army is sweeping the country. This is the direction of the struggle. The People's Liberation Army should actively participate in the great criticism together with the revolutionary masses of the proletariat across the country, thoroughly eliminate the pernicious influence of a small group of counter-revolutionary revisionists in the army. This will further consolidate the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought in the army, further strengthen the political and ideological construction of our army, and further promote the ideological revolutionization of the entire army.

In the Cultural Revolution, the broad cadres and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army are infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. They enthusiastically and wholeheartedly support the broad masses of the left, support industry, support agriculture, and carry out military control, military training, and other work, making new great contributions to the people.

In some places, some responsible officials of the local garrison troops made various mistakes in the work of supporting the left, and even made mistakes in direction and line. As long as they recognize their mistakes, criticize their mistakes, and correct their mistakes, it is still a matter of awareness. Making mistakes is not terrible, correcting them is good, correcting them will gain the understanding of the masses, will gain the support of the masses, and one can also learn from the mistakes, enhance immunity. If someone insists on not changing, then it is no longer a matter of awareness, and the nature of the mistake will change.

The People's Liberation Army and the broad revolutionary masses should actively respond to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to support the army and love the people. The People's Liberation Army should firmly stand on the side of the proletarian revolutionaries, unite with them, fight with them, and win with them. They should be good at adopting various appropriate methods to listen to the opinions and criticisms of the revolutionary masses, continuously improve the work of supporting the left. The broad proletarian revolutionaries should believe in, rely on, and cherish the People's Liberation Army, fully support the revolutionary actions of the People's Liberation Army. For the shortcomings and mistakes of some responsible officials of the local garrison troops in the work of supporting the left, they should adopt a realistic and benevolent attitude to help them correct. In the work of supporting the left, the contradictions between the army and the revolutionary masses should be strictly handled according to the principle of correctly handling contradictions among the people, according to the formula of "unity-criticism-unity," and should not arbitrarily and infinitely raise the level, treating contradictions among the people as contradictions between enemies and us. Under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought, further strengthening the unity between the army and the people is an important guarantee for achieving a thorough victory in the Cultural Revolution. Everyone should understand this.

Long live the great Chinese People's Liberation Army!

Long live the victory of the Cultural Revolution!

Long live the great Communist Party of China!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live our great leader and great commander Chairman Mao!

    无产阶级必须牢牢掌握枪杆子
    ——纪念中国人民解放军建军四十周年
    《红旗》杂志一九六七年第十二期社论
    伟大的中国人民解放军建军四十周年了。在无产阶级文化大革命胜利前进的大好形势下，我们以自豪的心情来纪念建军节，纪念我们伟大中国人民解放军光荣的战斗的胜利的历史。
    中国人民解放军，是我们伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造的，是林彪同志直接指挥的伟大军队，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的，真正掌握在人民手里的举世无双的最强大的革命军队。
    四十年来，中国人民解放军在伟大统帅毛主席的领导下，由小到大，由弱到强，艰苦奋斗，英勇牺牲，粉碎了蒋介石反动派五次大规模的“围剿”，胜利地进行了举世闻名的二万五千里长征，战胜了不可一世的日本侵略者，歼灭了由美帝国主义武装起来的八百万国民党反动军队，在抗美援朝战争中，又同朝鲜人民一起，打败了最凶恶的美帝国主义所拼凑的十四个国家的侵略军，为中国人民和世界人民立下了赫赫战功。伟大的中国人民解放军，是无数革命先烈的热血浇灌出来的革命鲜花，是中国人民和世界人民的骄傲和光荣。它不仅是我国无产阶级专政的柱石，而且是世界人民革命斗争的坚强后盾。
    一九二七年八月，在国民党完全叛变革命之后，在以毛主席为代表的正确路线战胜了陈独秀的右倾机会主义路线的条件下，在毛泽东思想的指引下，八一南昌起义打响了反对国民党反动派的第一枪。九月，我们伟大领袖毛主席在湖南农民运动的基础上，亲自领导农民暴动，举行了具有伟大历史意义的秋收起义，创立了井冈山根据地。中国人民开始了在正确路线领导下的武装斗争，开始有了一支完全新型的人民军队。
    “红旗卷起农奴戟”。秋收起义和向井冈山的伟大进军，在中国革命史上和我军的建军史上具有划时代的意义。从此，开辟了无产阶级先锋队深入农村，领导农民进行武装斗争，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，夺取全国政权的革命道路。
    毛主席关于农村包围城市、武装夺取政权的光辉思想，是对马克思列宁主义的天才发展。它不仅为中国人民开辟了夺取全国胜利的唯一正确的道路，而且为全世界无产阶级和被压迫人民指出了争取真正解放的康庄大道。
    毛主席说：“军队是国家政权的主要成份。谁想夺取国家政权，并想保持它，谁就应有强大的军队。”剥削阶级总是依靠暴力来维持自己的统治，对人民实行残酷的剥削和掠夺。被剥削阶级稍有反抗，就遭到反动军队的血腥镇压。反动派手里拿着刀，革命人民也必须拿起刀来。阶级斗争的最高形式是战争。不抓枪杆子，不用革命的武装去反对反革命的武装，人民就不可能翻身。没有人民的军队，人民的一切反抗都没有胜利的希望。即使暂时取得某些成就，只要敌人实行武装镇压，一切都成泡影。
    修正主义者的最大罪恶，就是反对人民进行武装斗争，反对无产阶级掌握枪杆子。老牌修正主义者伯恩斯坦、考茨基是这样，现代修正主义者赫鲁晓夫、多列士、陶里亚蒂、丹吉、南布迪里巴德之流也是这样。
    中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，和一切反革命修正主义者一样，一贯反对武装斗争，鼓吹议会道路，大搞投降主义。在抗日战争时期，他无耻地吹捧蒋介石是“革命的旗帜”，主张把人民军队交给蒋介石的“国民政府”去“领导”。抗战胜利以后，他公然主张把人民的军队拱手送给国民党反动派。
    毛主席彻底批判了不要人民军队、不搞武装斗争的反革命修正主义路线。中国人民，中国人民解放军，在毛主席的英明领导下，坚持武装斗争的道路，取得了民主革命的胜利，建立了无产阶级专政的伟大国家。
    在长期的革命战争中，毛主席创立了最完整、最科学、最伟大的军事学说。毛主席在古田会议决议和其他一系列的军事著作中，制定了一条真正无产阶级的军事路线。这是马克思列宁主义的军事思想的最高峰。这是世界革命人民战胜帝国主义和一切阶级敌人的最强大的武器。
    毛主席说：“整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”这是中国无产阶级和世界无产阶级用鲜血换来的经验总结。这是一个马克思列宁主义的普遍真理。这个真理正日益为全世界的无产阶级和被压迫的人民、被压迫的民族所掌握。亚洲、非洲、拉丁美洲许多地区的革命人民，正在奋发起来，踢开机会主义的领袖，勇敢地拿起枪杆子，建立人民的军队，开展武装斗争，大造以美国为首的帝国主义和一切反动派的反，大造以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的反，同旧世界进行英勇顽强的大搏斗。
    在整个社会主义时期，阶级斗争集中地表现为资产阶级复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争。资产阶级搞复辟，一定要抓军队，抓枪杆子。无产阶级要巩固无产阶级专政，粉碎资产阶级复辟阴谋，也必须牢牢掌握枪杆子，牢牢掌握军队。无产阶级取得政权之后，在一个很长的历史时期内，还有失去政权的危险；同样，建立了军队以后，仍然有失去军队的危险。如果失去了军队，军权被坏人所篡夺，那么，无产阶级和劳动人民所争得的一切，就会全部丧失。苏联赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺军权，实行反革命政变，就是一个严重的教训。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，是资本主义复辟势力的总代表。彭德怀、罗瑞卿是他在军队里的代理人。彭德怀是个大阴谋家、大野心家、大军阀，几十年来，他一贯站在资产阶级反动立场上，反对毛主席。在历次两条路线斗争中，他总是站在机会主义方面，反对毛主席的正确路线。一九五三年，他和高岗、饶漱石一起，结成彭、高、饶反党联盟。一九五九年，他又是党的庐山会议揭露出来的反党集团的头子。罗瑞卿也是一个资产阶级阴谋家、野心家。早在抗日战争时期，他就同彭德怀、彭真勾结在一起，反对毛主席，顽固地执行王明的投降主义路线，无耻地吹捧人民公敌蒋介石是抗日战争的“最高统帅”。全国胜利以后，他们进一步勾结起来，拚命抓枪杆子，推行资产阶级军事路线，妄图使人民的军队变成反革命复辟的工具。　
    毛泽东思想是我军的灵魂，是我军战无不胜的指南，是我军永不变质的根本保证。彭德怀、罗瑞卿之流为了改变我军的无产阶级性质，为了篡夺军权，首先把矛头指向毛泽东思想。彭德怀恶毒地攻击说“毛主席著作只能作参考，不能作为指导作战、训练部队的指针”。罗瑞卿胡说什么把毛主席的话当作最高指示“不符合我们国家的体制”。他还大肆推销党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的《修养》，吹捧这本书是“马列主义和中国革命实践的结合”，要全军干部战士“好好学习”。
    对待毛泽东思想的态度，是马克思列宁主义同反革命修正主义的分水岭。我们党、我们军队的一切胜利，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。我军四十年的经验告诉我们，离开了毛泽东思想的指导，就要犯错误，受挫折，遭失败。军队是阶级斗争的工具，不受无产阶级思想指导，就要受资产阶级思想指导。彭德怀、罗瑞卿之流拚命反对毛泽东思想，就是要用资产阶级思想、用修正主义的《修养》来指导我们的军队，就是要把我们的军队变成资产阶级的军队。
    彭德怀、罗瑞卿等反革命修正主义分子，为了改变我军的无产阶级性质，为了篡夺军权，拚死命地反对突出无产阶级政治，贩卖从外国搬来的一套修正主义货色，专搞资产阶级正规化，反对无产阶级革命化。他们把军事技术放在第一位，否认政治思想工作是决定战斗力的首要因素。彭德怀胡说什么“部队军事训练成绩的优劣，各级干部学习军事科学成绩的优劣，是决定我军今后战斗力高低的基本标准”。罗瑞卿用“大比武”来冲击政治，并且散布一套折中主义即机会主义的谬论，反对林彪同志关于突出政治和四个第一的指示。
    认为决定军队战斗力的高低的基本标准是军事技术，这是彻头彻尾的资产阶级的军事观点。我们军队的最大战斗力是什么？是飞机吗？是大炮吗？是原子弹吗？不是，完全不是。我军的最大战斗力是战无不胜的毛泽东思想，是用毛泽东思想武装起来的有高度政治觉悟的革命战士。反对突出无产阶级政治，把军事技术放在第一位，这就是突出资产阶级政治。事实上，彭德怀、罗瑞卿之流，是一贯反对无产阶级政治，突出资产阶级反动政治的。在抗日战争时期，彭德怀就大肆宣扬“自由、平等、博爱”的资产阶级反动政治观点。罗瑞卿的《抗日军队中的政治工作》一书，完全不讲阶级斗争，不讲无产阶级夺取政权，竟然认贼作父，把“蒋委员长的伟大及其生平”和蒋介石的“智、仁、勇”，“忠孝、仁爱”作为军队政治工作的基本内容。他们所宣扬的完全是国民党的反动政治。
    彭德怀、罗瑞卿在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的支持下，在军队里培植私人势力，树立个人威信，招降纳叛，结党营私，里通外国，阴谋篡党、篡军。彭德怀搜罗一小撮混进党内的阶级异己分子、投机分子、反革命分子、没有改造的旧军官等牛鬼蛇神，结成反党集团、反革命的“军事俱乐部”。罗瑞卿伙同反革命修正主义分子彭真、陆定一、杨尚昆等，结成反党阴谋集团。他们私自封官许愿，拉一批，打一批。他们做尽了坏事。他们力图在军队里搞反动资产阶级的独立王国。这一小撮人处心积虑地反对我们的伟大领袖、伟大统帅毛主席，反对一贯高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗的林彪同志。
    总之，中国赫鲁晓夫在军内的代理人彭德怀、罗瑞卿这些家伙，力图用反革命修正主义、资产阶级的一套来改造我们的军队、篡夺军队的领导权。如果他们的阴谋得逞，枪杆子掌握在他们手里，我们的国家就要改变颜色，我们就会亡党、亡国、亡头。
    在把我军建设成为一支非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命军队的斗争中，在反对资产阶级代表人物彭德怀、罗瑞卿等篡军阴谋的斗争中，林彪同志作出了极为卓越的贡献。
    林彪同志是毛主席最亲密的战友，最好的学生。林彪同志，对毛主席著作学得最好，用得最好，对毛泽东思想领会得最深。几十年来，他一贯最忠实、最坚定、最彻底地执行和保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和军事思想。在历次两条路线斗争中，他都是旗帜鲜明地、坚定地站在毛主席的正确路线一边。林彪同志在《高举党的总路线和毛泽东军事思想的红旗阔步前进》、《人民战争胜利万岁》等著作和一系列讲话中，系统地阐明了和创造性地发挥了毛主席的军事思想。
    林彪同志主持中央军委工作以来，创造性地提出了“四个第一”的思想，提出了大兴三八作风，发扬三大民主，开展四好连队运动。一九六○年中央军委扩大会议上，根据林彪同志的思想所作出的《关于加强军队政治思想工作的决议》，继承和发扬了古田会议的传统。林彪同志向全体指战员发出的“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”的伟大号召；他所提出的对毛主席的著作要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在用字上狠下功夫的原则和方法，对全军和全国人民掌握毛泽东思想，实现思想革命化，起了极大的推动作用。林彪同志提出的保持我军无产阶级性质的一系列重大措施，使我军的建设进入了一个新的阶段。
    毛主席指出：四个第一好，这是个创造。解放军的思想政治工作和军事工作，经林彪同志提出四个第一、三八作风之后，比较过去有了一个很大的发展，更具体化又更理论化了。
    林彪同志高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，彻底揭露和批判了彭德怀、罗瑞卿的资产阶级军事思想，同他们的篡党、篡军阴谋进行了坚决的斗争。为了防止资本主义复辟，林彪同志特别强调了意识形态的斗争和无产阶级掌握军队的严重意义。他指出：“笔杆子、枪杆子，夺取政权靠这两杆子。”“资产阶级搞颠覆活动，也是思想领先，先把人们的思想搞乱。另一个是搞军队，抓枪杆子。文武相配合，抓舆论，又抓枪杆子，他们就能搞反革命政变。”这是一个非常重要的论点。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们要把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揭露出来，从政治上和思想上把他们斗倒、斗臭。同样，也要把军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派揭露出来，从政治上和思想上把他们斗倒、斗臭。这些家伙，还在垂死挣扎。不久以前，武汉地区党内和军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派就勾结起来对无产阶级革命派进行镇压。事实证明，我们必须进一步地开展革命的大批判，把党内和军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，彻底干净地扫进垃圾堆里去。只有这样，才能防止资本主义复辟。
    目前，全国正在掀起一个对党内、军内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判运动。这是斗争的大方向。人民解放军要同全国无产阶级革命派一起，积极参加大批判，彻底清除一小撮反革命修正主义分子在军内散布的恶劣影响。这将进一步巩固毛泽东思想在军队中的领导权，进一步加强我军的政治思想建设，进一步促进全军的思想革命化。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，解放军广大指战员，无限忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，满腔热情地，全心全意地支援左派广大群众，支援工业，支援农业，进行军管、军训等工作，为人民作出了新的伟大贡献。
    有的地方，当地驻军的某些负责人，在支左工作中犯了这样那样的错误，甚至犯了方向、路线的错误。只要认识错误、检讨错误、改正错误，还是属于认识问题。犯了错误不要紧，改正了就好了，改正了就会得到群众的谅解，就会得到群众的拥护，而自己也就可以从错误中汲取教训，增强免疫力。如果有人坚持不改，那就不是认识问题了，错误的性质也要起变化。
    人民解放军、广大革命群众，要积极响应伟大领袖毛主席拥军爱民的战斗号召。人民解放军要坚决站在无产阶级革命派一边，和他们团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。要善于采取各种适当的方式，听取革命群众的意见和批评，不断地改进支左工作。广大无产阶级革命派要相信、依靠和爱护人民解放军，全力支持人民解放军的革命行动。对于当地驻军某些负责人在支左工作中的缺点和错误，要采取实事求是的、与人为善的态度，帮助他们改正。在支左工作中，军队和革命群众之间的矛盾，要严格按照正确处理人民内部矛盾的原则，按照“团结——批评——团结”的公式来处理，而不要无根据地无限上纲，把人民内部矛盾当成敌我矛盾。在毛泽东思想的照耀下，进一步加强军民团结，是取得无产阶级文化大革命彻底胜利的重要保证。大家都应该懂得这个道理。
    伟大的中国人民解放军万岁！
    无产阶级文化大革命胜利万岁！
    伟大的中国共产党万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    我们的伟大领袖、伟大统帅毛主席万岁！
