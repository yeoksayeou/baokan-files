In the great "January Revolution" storm's birthplace, Shanghai, the broad masses of workers, peasants, Red Guards, revolutionary teachers and students, and revolutionary cadres, are holding high the great red banner of invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They are filled with boundless love for the great leader Chairman Mao and bitter hatred for China's Khrushchev. From every front and every angle, they are pursuing and attacking the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road, this bunch of "drowning dogs." This great exposure, criticism, and struggle is unprecedented in its ferocity and scale. The broad masses of the proletarian revolutionary factions and revolutionary masses, remembering the great leader Chairman Mao's teaching to "carry the revolution through to the end," are determined to, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, thoroughly criticize, expose, and overthrow China's Khrushchev and his big and small lackeys, to knock this bunch of "drowning dogs" down to the ground and stomp on them with both feet, so they can never rise again.

In recent days, Shanghai's proletarian revolutionary factions, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses have held demonstrations, angrily denouncing China's Khrushchev. Today, another 500,000 people held a grand demonstration and march, expressing their firm resolve to carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end.

The proletarian revolutionary factions of Shanghai, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, have always stood at the forefront of the great criticism movement. Since April, Shanghai's great criticism movement has become increasingly widespread and profound. In factories, rural areas, military units, offices, schools, hospitals, and neighborhoods, criticism meetings and denunciation meetings are being held everywhere, and revolutionary big-character posters are everywhere. People are verbally and in writing attacking the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road, exposing the reactionary face of this bunch of class enemies more and more under the bright daylight.

The proletarian revolutionary factions and Red Guards of Shanghai, tempered by the "January Revolution" storm, have deeply understood from the sharp and complex class struggle: China's Khrushchev and his big and small lackeys, though exposed today, are still alive and their hearts are not dead. Whether they are big snakes or small snakes, whether they are snakes showing their poisonous fangs or snakes transformed into beautiful women, their vicious and ferocious nature will not change at all. The great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not willingly accept their defeat; they will make their last struggle." "The Chinese people will show no mercy to snake-like evil persons." The broad masses of the proletarian revolutionary factions believe that at present, the great criticism of China's Khrushchev and his lackeys is a matter of first importance concerning the fate of the Chinese revolution and the world revolution. Only by thoroughly criticizing, exposing, and overthrowing China's Khrushchev and his lackeys, and thoroughly purging the poison of their counter-revolutionary revisionist line in every field, can we ensure that our motherland's socialist red mountains will never change color, and ensure that the world revolution will advance victoriously along the invincible course of Mao Zedong Thought.

Many proletarian revolutionary factions in Shanghai's factories, schools, and offices are determined to accelerate revolutionary great unity and revolutionary "three-in-one combinations" in this great criticism movement. Units that have already achieved revolutionary great unity have further consolidated this great unity in the struggle to criticize China's Khrushchev. Not long ago, there were still disputes, even "internal wars," among some revolutionary mass organizations; recently, on the premise of common enemies and a unified direction, many revolutionary mass organizations have stopped "internal wars," and some have even held denunciation meetings and criticism meetings together, taking a good step towards revolutionary great unity.

Under the sunshine and rain of Mao Zedong Thought, the working class of Shanghai has grown and become strong. They have studied Lu Xun's "On 'Fei-er-pai-lai' Should Be Postponed" and the editorial notes of the People's Daily and the PLA Daily, and their common hatred for the enemy and fighting spirit have become even more ardent. Many revolutionary faction fighters who have "killed" their way out under the oppression of the bourgeois reactionary line, recalling the struggle practice of the past year, are even more indignant about China's Khrushchev's evil plot to restore capitalism. China's Khrushchev and his accomplices, standing on the reactionary bourgeois position, practicing bourgeois dictatorship, have suppressed the proletarian cultural revolution movement, confusing right and wrong, mixing black and white, besieging the revolutionary factions, suppressing different opinions, and practicing white terror. Many revolutionary faction fighters say, if we let them succeed again, we laboring people will suffer twice the hardship and twice the misery, living a life worse than cattle, with thousands of heads falling to the ground. We will not agree to this, not in a thousand ways, not in a million ways. Now, China's Khrushchev and his lackeys have become "drowning dogs," but they are still "biting dogs," still trying to return to the stage. In the face of a great enemy, our primary task as proletarian revolutionary factions is to unite on the basis of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and fight the enemy together. This is our direction of struggle. To deviate from this is wrong. The proletarian revolutionary factions of the Shanghai Third Steel Plant, Xianfeng Electrical Machinery Factory, and other factories have expressed their determination to mobilize everyone to think and work hard, with an unyielding spirit of continuous battle, to throw themselves into this great criticism; to seriously study and apply Chairman Mao's works, using the telescope and microscope of great Mao Zedong Thought to grasp the key points, engage in close combat, and struggle; to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the great criticism, thoroughly eliminate the poison spread by China's Khrushchev and his lackeys on the industrial front, and turn the factory into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Many primary, secondary, and tertiary schools in Shanghai that are vigorously carrying out the "resume classes and make revolution" movement are continuing to charge forward in this new wave of great criticism, playing a vanguard role. They believe that to resume classes and make revolution, we must first resume the class of great criticism and struggle, and through great criticism and struggle, further promote the resumption of classes and revolution. Revolutionary teachers and students of Fudan University and many other schools, with deep hatred for China's Khrushchev and his lackeys, have compiled many propaganda materials, rushed to produce many cartoons and slogans, and rehearsed a batch of cultural propaganda programs. Revolutionary teachers and students have been working day and night, expressing their determination to knock China's Khrushchev down to the ground and make him never rise again.

The broad poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs of Shanghai have also actively participated in this great criticism struggle. Through various criticism meetings, they have launched a great criticism of the handful of power-holders in the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Many poor and lower-middle peasants angrily say that China's Khrushchev's crimes of attempting to restore capitalism in the countryside are iron-clad evidence, undeniable and inescapable. We must not relax in the slightest in the struggle to criticize this China's Khrushchev; we must fight him until he is completely overthrown and completely finished.

The entire cadre and fighter contingent of a certain wired communications unit of the Shanghai Air Force, which has consecutively won the "Four Goods" for five years, has expressed that they will not only firmly grasp the gun but also take up the pen, pursuing and attacking the "drowning dogs" to drown them in the vast ocean of people's war. We, the people's warriors, will resolutely use our lives and blood to defend Chairman Mao and safeguard the dictatorship of the proletariat, and create new merits for the people in the great criticism and struggle.

    上海广大革命群众誓把文化大革命进行到底
    用毛泽东思想作为革命大批判武器
    彻底肃清各条战线上修正主义流毒
    据新华社上海十八日电　在伟大的“一月革命”风暴的发源地上海，广大工农兵、红卫兵小将、革命师生和革命干部，高举战无不胜的毛泽东思想伟大红旗，满怀对伟大领袖毛主席的无限热爱，对中国的赫鲁晓夫的切齿痛恨，从各条战线、各个方面，穷追猛打党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派这伙“落水狗”。这场大揭发、大批判、大斗争，来势之猛，规模之大，空前未有。广大无产阶级革命派和革命群众，牢记伟大领袖毛主席“将革命进行到底”的教导，决心从政治上、思想上、理论上，把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其大小爪牙彻底批透、批倒、批臭，把这伙“落水狗”打翻在地，再踏上一只脚，叫他们永世不得翻身。
    连日来，上海无产阶级革命派、红卫兵小将和革命群众举行示威，愤怒声讨中国的赫鲁晓夫。今天又有五十万人举行声势浩大的示威游行，表示一定要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的坚强决心。
    用毛泽东思想武装起来的上海无产阶级革命派，始终站在革命大批判的最前列。四月份以来，上海的革命大批判运动越来越广泛，越来越深入。在工厂、农村、部队、机关、学校、医院、街道，到处都在召开批判会、声讨会，到处都是革命的批判的大字报。人们口诛笔伐，斗争矛头紧紧对准党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，使这伙阶级敌人的总后台的反动面目越来越暴露在光天化日之下。
    经过“一月革命”风暴考验的上海无产阶级革命派和红卫兵小将，从尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中深刻地懂得：中国的赫鲁晓夫和他的大小娄罗们，今天虽然被揪出来了，但是这一伙吃人的野兽，人还在，心不死，不管他们是大蛇还是小蛇，是露出毒牙的蛇还是化成美女的蛇，他们恶毒凶残的本性是丝毫不会改变的。伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。”“中国人民决不怜惜蛇一样的恶人”。广大无产阶级革命派认为，当前，对中国的赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙的大批判，是关系到中国革命和世界革命命运的头等大事，只有把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙彻底批倒批臭，彻底肃清他们推行的反革命修正主义路线在各个领域里的流毒，才能保证祖国的社会主义红色江山永不变色，保证世界革命沿着战无不胜的毛泽东思想的航道胜利前进。
    上海许多工厂、学校、机关的无产阶级革命派，决心在这场革命的大批判中加速革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。已经实现了革命大联合的单位，在对中国的赫鲁晓夫的批判斗争中进一步巩固了这种大联合。不久前，有些革命群众组织之间还有争论，甚至打“内战”；最近，在共同对敌、大方向一致的前提下，许多革命群众组织已经停止“内战”，有些还一起开声讨会、批判会，向革命的大联合迈出了很好的一步。
    在毛泽东思想阳光雨露下成长壮大的上海工人阶级，学习了鲁迅《论“费厄泼赖”应该缓行》和《人民日报》、《解放军报》的编者按语，同仇敌忾，斗志更加昂扬。许多在资产阶级反动路线压制下“杀”出来的革命派战士，回顾一年来的斗争实践，对中国的赫鲁晓夫妄图复辟资本主义的罪恶阴谋更加愤慨。中国的赫鲁晓夫及其同伙，站在反动的资产阶级立场上，实行资产阶级专政，将无产阶级轰轰烈烈的文化大革命运动打下去，颠倒是非，混淆黑白，围剿革命派，压制不同意见，实行白色恐怖。许多革命派战士都说，如果再让他们得逞，我们劳动人民就会吃二遍苦，受二遍罪，过牛马不如的生活，千万人头要落地，我们一千个不答应，一万个不答应。现在，中国的赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙已经成了“落水狗”，可是他们还是“咬人之狗”，还想重新登台。大敌当前，我们无产阶级革命派首要的任务就是在毛主席无产阶级革命路线的基础上联合起来，共同对敌。这就是我们斗争的大方向。背离这一点，就是错误的。上海第三钢铁厂、先锋电机厂等厂的无产阶级革命派表示，一定要大家动手动脑，认真思考，以不怕疲劳，连续作战的精神，投入这场大批判；决心认真活学活用毛主席著作，用伟大的毛泽东思想的望远镜、显微镜，抓住要害，短兵相接，进行斗争；在大批判中更好地活学活用毛主席著作，彻底清除中国的赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙在工业战线上散布的流毒，把工厂办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
    正在轰轰烈烈开展“复课闹革命”的上海许多大中小学校革命师生和红卫兵小将，在这场大批判新高潮中继续冲锋陷阵，起了先锋的作用。他们认为，复课闹革命，首先要复好大批判大斗争的课，通过大批判大斗争，进一步推动复课闹革命。复旦大学等许多学校的革命师生，怀着对中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙的深仇大恨，编写了许多宣传材料，赶制了许多漫画、标语，并且排练了一批文艺宣传节目。革命师生彻夜奋战，表达了他们誓把中国赫鲁晓夫打翻在地，叫他永世不得翻身的决心。
    上海郊区的广大贫下中农，也积极投入了这场革命的大批判斗争。他们通过各种批判会，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，展开了大批判。许多贫下中农愤怒地说，中国的赫鲁晓夫在农村妄想复辟资本主义的罪行，铁证如山，赖不掉，逃不脱。对这个中国的赫鲁晓夫的批判斗争，我们决不能有半点松懈，一定要斗得他彻底垮台，彻底完蛋为止。
    驻沪空军某部连续五年获得“四好”的有线电连全体指战员表示，不仅要紧握枪杆子，而且要拿起笔杆子，穷追猛打“落水狗”，叫它淹死在“人民战争”的汪洋大海之中。我们人民战士坚决用生命和鲜血来保卫毛主席，捍卫无产阶级专政，在大批判大斗争中为人民立新功。
