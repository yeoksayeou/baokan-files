	"Policies and strategies are the lifeblood of the Party." The various policies on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally formulated by Chairman Mao, concretely embody Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and strategic thinking, reflect the objective laws of class struggle, and represent the fundamental interests of the broad masses. We must resolutely carry out and implement the Party's policies; we must resolutely resist and oppose any speech and action that violates the Party's policies. Reviewing the battle course of the Star Fire Troupe in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we deeply feel that we must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, resolutely carry out the Party's line and policies, and only then can we advance from victory to victory in the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads.

	I

	Chairman Mao personally formulated the "Sixteen Points" which state: "The focus of this movement is to criticize those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road." This is the direction of the struggle, and we must firmly grasp this direction of the struggle. If we deviate from this direction, we will not be able to correctly implement the Party's policies and will go astray.

	In March and April of this year, we established the Cultural Revolution Committee Preparatory Committee on the basis of an initial great alliance. However, soon after its establishment, it was fiercely opposed by some people. A part of the masses, who were not clear about the situation, attacked us. Under this pressure, many comrades withdrew from the Preparatory Committee. Those who remained held three consecutive meetings, each lasting until late at night. In the debates, we seriously studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "In Hebei Province, there is a very small cooperative with only six households. Three households of middle-aged and old peasants firmly refused to continue, and they were allowed to leave; the three households of poor peasants expressed that they would continue no matter what, and they were allowed to stay. The organization of the cooperative was thus preserved. In fact, the direction taken by these three households of poor peasants is the direction of the 500 million peasants nationwide. All individual farming peasants will ultimately take the road chosen by these three households of poor peasants." Chairman Mao's teachings, at the most critical moment of the struggle, gave us the greatest encouragement. We were so moved that we shed tears of joy. The truth becomes clearer with debate, and our eyes become brighter with wiping. Five comrades who had already written statements to withdraw from the Preparatory Committee decided not to withdraw and resolutely fought to the end with everyone. We firmly believed that the truth was on our side. As long as we adhere to the direction of the struggle and resolutely act according to the Party's policies, no matter how great the difficulties, we can overcome them, and the deceived masses will eventually awaken.

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Policies are the starting point of all practical actions of a revolutionary party and are manifested in the process and outcome of action." In any situation, all our actions must conform to the Party's policies. We have been continuously attacked, and some comrades have even been beaten severely. Once or twice, we could still tolerate it with "no retaliation when beaten, no response when insulted." But after many times, some comrades developed a desire for revenge, saying "three strikes and out," wanting to "vent some anger" and strike back hard. However, thinking of the direction of the struggle, thinking of the policy of "using ideological struggle, not physical struggle," and thinking of Chairman Mao's teachings on "resolving internal contradictions among the people, not using curses, fists, or weapons, but using discussion, persuasion, criticism, and self-criticism," we several times retracted our fists that were about to strike and continued to persist in ideological struggle. We understood that the deceived masses are our class brothers, not enemies. They beat us and insulted us because they were poisoned by the capitalist reactionary line. We should direct our hatred towards the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. If we retaliate with violence, that would be treating errors with errors, exactly falling into the trap of the class enemy.

	We strictly acted according to the Party's policies, did not engage in physical struggle, and focused our efforts on criticizing the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation within our unit. However, some people sneered at us, saying we had "no revolutionary spirit" and were "cowards." We believe that this view is wrong. Acting according to the Party's policies to carry out the struggle, criticism, and transformation within our unit, more thoroughly exposing and deeply criticizing the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, planting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought everywhere, this is the strongest revolutionary spirit. Not implementing the Party's policies, engaging in beating, smashing, looting, searching, and arresting, is not revolutionary spirit, nor is it bravery or daring. Actions that violate Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies are not great democracy under the dictatorship of the proletariat, but bourgeois liberalization.

	Firmly implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy is an important issue in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We resolutely opposed the anarchist trend of "excluding and overthrowing everything" and conducted a class analysis and investigation of the cadres in our troupe. For those revolutionary leading cadres, we firmly supported them and fought side by side with them. For those cadres who made mistakes, we sincerely helped them to quickly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We specially formed a small group to actively carry out work: organizing them to study Chairman Mao's works and the Party's policies, helping them to dispel their worries and raise their consciousness; inviting them to participate in the criticism of the capitalist reactionary line, making them further recognize the evil of the capitalist reactionary line; seriously and sincerely criticizing their mistakes, helping them to touch their souls and conduct a thorough self-examination; supporting those who have recognized their mistakes and are determined to correct them to boldly grasp their work, giving them the opportunity to correct their mistakes. Because we firmly implemented Chairman Mao's cadre policy, we united the majority of the cadres and directed the struggle at the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

	II

	Chairman Mao teaches us: "Our policies should not only be known by the leaders and cadres but also by the broad masses. Once the masses know the truth and have a common goal, they will unite to do it. Once the masses are united, everything will be easy." In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, making the Party's policies known to the masses, making the policies grasped by the masses, and turning them into conscious actions of the masses, this is the key to strictly implementing the Party's policies.

	Turning the Party's policies into conscious actions of the masses is essentially unifying the thoughts and actions of the masses with Mao Zedong Thought. When the central policies came down, we promptly and specifically studied Chairman Mao's relevant works and quotations, studied the policy texts word for word, and understood their spirit and essence; organized discussions and exchanges, combined with the situation, linked with thoughts, and promptly solved the ideological obstacles to implementing the policies; in the process of implementing the policies, repeatedly propagated, checked against the policies, found gaps, proposed measures, and made the policies truly effective.

	In correctly handling the issue of the deceived masses, we did a series of political and ideological work within the Preparatory Committee. Some comrades thought that those who participated in the conservative organization opposed us at every turn and even used fists against us, making it impossible to unite with these people. This reflected that some comrades' attitude towards the deceived masses was wrong and they had not fully understood Chairman Mao's principle of uniting more than 95% of the masses. To solve this problem, we organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and relevant quotations: "We must not only unite with those who agree with us but also be good at uniting with those who disagree with us. We must also be good at uniting with those who have opposed us and have been proven wrong by practice." Through study and discussion, everyone realized that the contradictions between the deceived masses and us are internal contradictions among the people and must not be confused with the contradictions between us and the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

	We invited those who had returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to share their personal experiences. Their experiences vividly showed that once they realized they had deviated from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they felt very painful, like a child separated from its mother, eating without appetite, and sleeping without peace. They eagerly hoped to join the revolutionary mass organizations as soon as possible. This made everyone further realize that we have the obligation to approach, unite, and help the deceived masses, but not the right to despise, alienate, or exclude them.

	Some comrades were worried: absorbing the deceived masses into the Preparatory Committee would make the organization impure; if there were more fluctuations, these people would collaborate from within and without, and the Preparatory Committee would be ruined. This idea does not conform to Mao Zedong Thought and is the result of sectarianism, a manifestation of not trusting the masses. In the debate, everyone said that whether the Preparatory Committee would collapse or not did not depend on whether the deceived masses were absorbed or not, but on whether the Preparatory Committee itself held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, and strictly implemented the Party's policies. If we do not act according to Mao Zedong Thought, forget the Party's policies, and think "only I am revolutionary, others are not," we will inevitably alienate the masses, collapse on our own, and be defeated.

	After solving these problems, another phenomenon emerged. Some comrades did not pay attention to doing thorough and detailed political and ideological work on the deceived masses, regardless of whether they were conscious or not, and hurriedly pulled them into the Preparatory Committee. Aiming at this thought, we seriously studied Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said, "We advocate active ideological struggle because it is a weapon to achieve unity within the Party and revolutionary organizations for the sake of struggle." He also said that the method to resolve internal contradictions among the people is "starting from the desire for unity, through criticism or struggle, distinguishing right from wrong, and achieving new unity on a new basis." We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings, gradually achieve the unity of more than 95% of the masses through ideological struggle. Our unity is based on the principles of Mao Zedong Thought, not a unity without principles. The deceived masses must break with the capitalist reactionary line and truly return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in their thoughts. If we do not actively do political and ideological work, pulling the deceived masses in confusedly, it will neither benefit their progress nor the revolutionary cause.

	When the revolutionary masses truly understood the Party's policies and grasped the principle of uniting more than 95% of the masses, they actively approached the deceived masses to do political and ideological work, studied Chairman Mao's works with them, carrying questions, widely carried out heart-to-heart talks, invited them to participate in the criticism of the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit. Through common struggles against the enemy and thorough and detailed political and ideological work, the deceived masses dispelled their worries and raised their consciousness. Now, most of the deceived masses have returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and are fighting with us.

	III

	Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, principles, and policies are the concentrated embodiment of the fundamental interests of the proletariat. Only by standing on the proletarian standpoint and having proletarian feelings can we correctly understand and implement them.

	Anarchist, sectarian, subjective, and individualist trends within the revolutionary ranks are ideological obstacles to implementing the Party's policies. Such trends also appear within our Preparatory Committee. We followed the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin: "We must regard ourselves as a force of the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. The revolution must also revolutionize ourselves. If we do not revolutionize ourselves, the revolution will not be successful." We repeatedly studied the "Three Articles" and "On Rectifying Erroneous Ideas Within the Party," and while transforming the objective world, we also transformed our subjective world, seizing power from the handful of those in power within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and seizing power from the "self" in our minds.

	Regarding the Party's policies, "if 'self' is in command, they cannot be implemented; if 'public' is in command, they can be implemented." Sometimes, we felt that our thoughts were distant from the Party's policies, so we calmed down, thought about whether we had deviated from Mao Zedong Thought, whether we had stood on the wrong side, and at the same time, brought questions to study Chairman Mao's works. With Mao Zedong Thought in command, we did not start from personal and small group interests but from the interests of the Party and the people to understand problems, and we felt that the Party's policies were very familiar and correct, and our consciousness of implementing them was greatly enhanced.

	To better transform our thoughts in the struggle and make the Party's policies truly effective, our Preparatory Committee often carried out criticism and self-criticism. After the proletarian revolutionary faction gained the upper hand, some comrades developed a sense of pride and complacency, and the study of Chairman Mao's works and the Party's policies was not tight, leading to the phenomenon of replacing policies with emotions. Aiming at this situation, we firmly grasped the study of actively applying Chairman Mao's works and the Party's policies, resolutely opposed pride, and fought against "self." Comrades realized that the proletarian revolutionary faction must grasp power well and use it well, prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, maintain a humble and prudent, unassuming and unyielding style, and the more victories we achieve, the more we must strictly implement the Party's policies. If we are not vigilant and let individualism develop, it will bring harm to the revolution and even turn against ourselves.

	Chairman Mao said: "If we make mistakes in our policies, we will not be able to achieve victory." The victories we have achieved are only the first step of the ten-thousand-li long march. To achieve the thorough victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we must advance along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, always, in everything, and everywhere act according to the Party's policies, and be a model in implementing the Party's policies.

    不折不扣地按党的政策办事
    中国人民解放军第二炮兵星火文工团文革筹委会
    “政策和策略是党的生命”。毛主席亲自主持制定的关于无产阶级文化大革命的各项政策，具体地体现了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线和策略思想，反映了阶级斗争的客观规律，代表了广大人民的根本利益。对党的政策，我们必须坚决贯彻，坚决执行；对违反党的政策的言论和行动，必须坚决抵制，坚决反对。回顾星火文工团在无产阶级文化大革命中所走过的战斗历程，我们深深地体会到，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决贯彻党的方针政策，才能在两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争中从胜利走向胜利。
    一
    毛主席亲自主持制定的十六条中指出：“这次运动的重点，是整党内那些走资本主义道路的当权派。”这是斗争的大方向，我们一定要牢牢掌握这个斗争的大方向，如果违背了这个大方向，就不可能正确执行党的政策，就会走到邪路上去。
    今年三、四月间，我们在初步大联合的基础上，成立了文化革命委员会筹委会。但是，成立后不久，就遭到了一些人的激烈反对，一部分不明真相的群众，对我们进行围攻。在这种压力下，不少同志退出了筹委会，留下来的同志连续开了三天会议，每天都辩论到深夜。在辩论中，我们认真学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“河北省有一个很小的合作社只有六户，三户老中农坚决不想再干下去，结果让他们走了；三户贫农则表示无论如何要继续干下去，结果让他们留下，社的组织也保存了。其实，这三户贫农所表示的方向，就是全国五亿农民的方向。一切个体经营的农民，终归是要走这三户贫农所坚决地选择了的道路的。”毛主席的教导，在斗争最困难的关键时刻，给了我们最大的鼓舞，我们激动得流下了热泪。真理越辩越明，眼睛越擦越亮。有五个已经写好声明准备退出筹委会的同志，表示不再退出，坚决和大家一起干到底。我们坚信，真理在我们这一边。只要坚持斗争大方向，坚决按照党的政策办事，天大的困难，我们也能克服，受蒙蔽的群众迟早是会觉悟过来的。
    毛主席教导我们：“政策是革命政党一切实际行动的出发点，并且表现于行动的过程和归宿。”在任何情况下，我们的任何行动都必须符合党的政策。我们曾经连续受到围攻，有些同志甚至遭到毒打。一次两次，还能做到“打不还手，骂不还口”。次数多了，有的同志就产生了报复情绪，说“事不过三”，要“出出气”，狠狠地还击一下。但是，想到斗争的大方向，想到“要用文斗，不用武斗”的政策，想到毛主席关于“解决人民内部矛盾，不能用咒骂，也不能用拳头，更不能用刀枪，只能用讨论的方法，说理的方法，批评和自我批评的方法”的教导，几次把伸出去的拳头缩了回来，继续坚持说理斗争。我们懂得，受蒙蔽的群众是我们的阶级兄弟，不是敌人。他们打我们，骂我们，是受了资产阶级反动路线的毒害，我们应该把仇恨记在党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的帐上。如果以牙还牙，以眼还眼，那就是以错误对待错误，正好上了阶级敌人的当。
    我们严格地按照党的政策办事，不搞武斗，集中力量批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，进行本单位的斗批改，有人却讥笑我们“没有革命性”，是“胆小鬼”。我们认为，这种看法，是错误的。按照党的政策搞好本单位的斗批改，更充分地揭露、更深入地批判党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批深批透，把毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍各个阵地，这才是最强的革命性。不执行党的政策，热中于打、砸、抢、抄、抓，决不是什么“革命性”，也决不是什么“勇敢”、“大胆”。违背了毛泽东思想，违背了党的政策的“自由”行动，就不是无产阶级专政下的大民主，而是资产阶级的自由化。
    坚决贯彻毛主席的干部政策，是无产阶级文化大革命中的一个重要问题。我们坚决反对了“排斥一切、打倒一切”的无政府主义思潮，对我团的干部逐个进行了阶级分析和调查研究。对那些革命领导干部，我们坚决支持他们，同他们并肩战斗。对那些犯有错误的干部，我们满腔热忱地去帮助他们，使他们迅速地回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。我们专门组成了一个小组，积极地去进行工作：组织他们学习毛主席著作和党的政策，帮助他们解除顾虑，提高觉悟；吸收他们参加批判资产阶级反动路线的活动，使他们进一步认识资产阶级反动路线的罪恶；对他们的错误，进行严肃认真的批评，帮助他们触及灵魂，深刻检查；支持那些认识了错误并决心改正的干部大胆地抓业务，给以改正错误的机会。由于坚决贯彻了毛主席的干部政策，我们团结了干部的大多数，把斗争的矛头指向了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    二
    毛主席教导我们：“我们的政策，不光要使领导者知道，干部知道，还要使广大的群众知道。”“群众知道了真理，有了共同的目的，就会齐心来做。”“群众齐心了，一切事情就好办了。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，把党的政策交给群众，使政策为群众所掌握，变为群众的自觉行动，这是不折不扣地贯彻执行党的政策的关键所在。
    把党的政策变成群众的自觉行动，实质上就是用毛泽东思想来统一群众的思想和行动。中央的政策下来时，我们就及时地有针对性地学习毛主席的有关著作和语录，原原本本地学习政策条文，领会精神实质；组织座谈讨论，结合形势，联系思想，及时解决贯彻政策的思想障碍；在贯彻执行政策的过程中，反复宣传，对照检查，找出差距，提出措施，使政策真正落到实处。
    在正确对待受蒙蔽群众的问题上，我们在筹委会内部做了一系列的政治思想工作。有的同志认为，参加保守组织的人处处同我们唱对台戏，甚至对我们动拳头，不可能同这些人团结在一起。这反映了部分同志对受蒙蔽群众的态度不对头，没有很好地领会毛主席的团结百分之九十五以上的群众的原则。为了解决这个问题，我们组织大家学习毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和有关语录：“不但要团结和自己意见相同的人，而且要善于团结那些和自己意见不同的人，还要善于团结那些反对过自己并且已被实践证明是犯了错误的人。”通过学习、讨论，大家认识到，受蒙蔽群众同我们之间的矛盾，属于人民内部矛盾，绝不能把同受蒙蔽群众的矛盾，与同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾混淆起来。
    我们请那些回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来的同志谈自己的亲身感受。他们的感受生动地说明，一旦认识到自己脱离了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，心里很痛苦，就象孩子离开了娘，吃饭不香，睡觉不安。他们迫切希望尽早加入革命群众组织。这就使大家进一步认识到，对受蒙蔽的群众，我们只有亲近、团结、帮助他们的义务，而没有轻视、疏远、排斥他们的权利。
    有的同志担心：吸收受蒙蔽的群众加入筹委会，会造成组织不纯；再有反复，这些人来个里应外合，会把筹委会搞垮。这种想法不符合毛泽东思想，是小团体主义思想作怪，是不相信群众的表现。在辩论中，大家说，筹委会垮台不垮台，不决定于是否吸收受蒙蔽的群众，而决定于筹委会本身是不是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，不折不扣地执行党的政策。如果我们不按照毛泽东思想办事，忘了党的政策，以为“唯我革命，别人不革命”，那就必然会脱离群众，不攻自破，自己垮台。
    这些问题解决后，又出现了另一种现象，个别同志不注意对受蒙蔽的群众做深入细致的政治思想工作，不管他们觉悟不觉悟，就急于拉入筹委会。针对这种思想，我们认真学习了毛主席著作，毛主席说，“我们主张积极的思想斗争，因为它是达到党内和革命团体内的团结使之利于战斗的武器。”又说，解决人民内部矛盾的方法是，“从团结的愿望出发，经过批评或者斗争，分清是非，在新的基础上达到新的团结”。我们必须遵照毛主席的教导，通过思想斗争，逐步实现团结百分之九十五以上的群众。我们的团结是在毛泽东思想原则基础上的团结，不是一团和气，无原则的团结。受蒙蔽的群众必须同资产阶级反动路线决裂，真正从思想上回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。如果不积极地做政治思想工作，把受蒙蔽的群众稀里糊涂地拉进来，既不利于他们的进步，也不利于革命事业。
    革命群众真正理解了党的政策，掌握了团结百分之九十五以上的群众的原则，就纷纷主动地向受蒙蔽的群众做政治思想工作，同他们一起带着问题学习毛主席著作，广泛开展谈心活动，吸收他们参加批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和本单位斗批改的活动。通过共同的对敌斗争和深入细致的政治思想工作，受蒙蔽的群众消除了顾虑，提高了觉悟。现在，大部分受蒙蔽的群众已经回到了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来，同我们一起战斗。
    三
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线、方针、政策，是无产阶级根本利益的集中体现，只有站在无产阶级的立场上，具有无产阶级的思想感情，才能正确地理解和贯彻执行。
    革命队伍中的无政府主义、小团体主义、主观主义、个人主义等资产阶级、小资产阶级思潮，是贯彻执行党的政策的思想障碍。这种思潮，在我们筹委会内部也时有表现。我们遵照林副主席的指示，“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”我们反复学习了“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》，在改造客观世界的同时，改造自己的主观世界，既夺党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，又夺自己头脑里私字的权。
    对于党的政策，“私字当头，贯彻不了；公字当头，贯彻就好。”有时，我们感到自己的想法同党的政策有距离，就冷静下来，想一想自己是不是离开了毛泽东思想，是不是站错了队，同时，带着问题去学习毛主席著作。毛泽东思想挂了帅，不是从个人和小团体的利益出发，而是从党和人民的利益出发去认识问题，就感到党的各项政策十分亲切，条条正确，贯彻执行的自觉性也大大提高了。
    为了在斗争中更好地改造自己的思想，使党的各项政策真正落实，我们筹委会经常开展批评和自我批评。我们无产阶级革命派占了优势以后，有的同志滋长了骄傲自满情绪，对毛主席著作和党的政策的学习抓得不紧了，出现了以感情代替政策的现象。针对这种情况，我们狠抓活学活用毛主席著作和党的政策的学习，大反骄傲情绪，狠斗私字。同志们认识到，无产阶级革命派要掌好权用好权，必须防止资产阶级思想的侵蚀，保持谦虚谨慎、不骄不躁的作风，越是取得胜利，越要不折不扣地执行党的政策。如果不警惕，让个人主义发展起来，就会给革命带来损失，甚至走向自己的反面。
    毛主席说：“我们如果在政策上犯了错误，还是不能取得胜利。”我们已经取得的胜利，不过是万里长征走完了第一步。为了取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，我们必须沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线前进，时时、事事、处处按照党的政策办事，做执行党的政策的模范。　（载《红旗》杂志一九六七年第十一期）
