As the great "January Revolution" storm swept the nation and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution entered a new stage of power struggles, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party in Inner Mongolia saw their doom approaching. They desperately launched a counterattack against the revolutionary masses. They manipulated conservative organizations to attack the revolutionary masses. At this critical moment, the soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Inner Mongolia Military Region of the People's Liberation Army, without hesitation, supported the revolutionary masses of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Party Committee—the Red Flag United Headquarters, and smashed the enemy's plot.

The soldiers and officers of a certain unit of the Inner Mongolia Military Region followed Chairman Mao's teachings and first supported the revolutionary masses politically. They helped the Red Flag United Headquarters' fighters to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, seriously implement Party policies, and grasp the direction of the struggle. They brought us the fine traditions of the "Four Firsts" and the "Three-Eight Style." They helped us do ideological work among the deceived masses, uniting the majority of the masses to make revolution together, and expanded and developed the leftist forces.

We Red Flag fighters enthusiastically responded to Chairman Mao's call to support the army and love the people, and we love the People's Liberation Army even more. We actively engaged in supporting the army activities. We stood together with the People's Liberation Army, fought together, and won together, establishing a deep bond between the military and the people.

Firmly believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army

Chairman Mao said: "Without an army of the people, there can be no people's everything." Chairman Mao recently taught us: We must believe in and rely on the People's Liberation Army.

The fundamental issue of supporting the army is the attitude towards the People's Liberation Army, which is the issue of firmly believing in and relying on the People's Liberation Army. We repeatedly educated the Red Flag fighters to recognize that the People's Liberation Army is the army created by Chairman Mao and personally commanded by Vice Chairman Lin Biao, a strong pillar of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and a firm backing for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. The attitude towards the People's Liberation Army is the attitude towards the dictatorship of the proletariat and is also an important indicator of whether one is a genuine revolutionary leftist.

The class enemy fears the army the most, hates the army the most, and especially fears the unity between the People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat. Therefore, we must be vigilant against the enemy's attempts to sow discord between the military and the people. After a certain unit of the Inner Mongolia Military Region expressed support for us, the old Inner Mongolia Area Party Committee's capitalist-roaders saw the situation was not good, so they used conservative organizations to steal the name of the unit's soldiers and officers to distribute a leaflet in society to sow discord between the military and the people. The Red Flag fighters deeply felt that if we do not be vigilant and correctly treat the People's Liberation Army, we will stand on the wrong side and do things that make friends sad and enemies happy.

We Red Flag fighters follow Chairman Mao's teachings and correctly view the relationship between the mainstream and the non-mainstream in the People's Liberation Army's support-left work. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is an extremely complex and sharp class struggle on the political and ideological fronts. The People's Liberation Army's support for the local cultural revolution is a new historical task, so it is difficult to completely avoid some problems in the support-left work that are not handled properly. When the soldiers and officers of a certain unit first approached us, a few comrades were influenced by rumors in society and did not understand or like some of our things. Some of our Red Flag fighters also had some misunderstandings with the soldiers of the Liberation Army. To correctly deal with this problem, we promptly guided everyone to study Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "These comrades' method of looking at problems is wrong. They do not look at the essential and mainstream aspects of the problem but emphasize those non-essential and non-mainstream aspects. It should be pointed out: we should not ignore non-essential and non-mainstream aspects and must solve them one by one. But we should not regard these as essential and mainstream, so as not to confuse our direction." Following Chairman Mao's teaching, the Red Flag fighters discussed repeatedly and unanimously recognized that the soldiers and officers of the Liberation Army listen to the Party the most, are the most loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and supported the revolutionary masses of the proletariat at the critical moment. If we do not see this essential and mainstream aspect, we will lose our direction. Therefore, everyone pays attention to emphasizing the mainstream and achievements of the army's support-left work in any situation; if there are opinions about the People's Liberation Army, they are put forward in a realistic and truthful manner, and solved through discussions between the two sides' leaders. In this way, we quickly established a relationship of mutual trust and help with the broad masses of soldiers and officers.

On the basis of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, strengthen military-civilian unity

The People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat have a common stand and common feelings because they are both infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. We feel that on the basis of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, strengthening unity with the People's Liberation Army is the best way to support the army.

To strengthen unity, we must deepen mutual understanding. Among the Red Flag fighters, a few comrades have the idea that since they are revolutionary leftists, they will naturally receive the support of the People's Liberation Army, so they take a passive attitude of waiting for support. This idea is wrong. The People's Liberation Army's support for the revolutionary leftists requires a process of understanding and recognition. We should actively help the Liberation Army to know more about us, actively establish close relations with the Liberation Army, and actively seek greater support from the Liberation Army.

After a certain unit of the Liberation Army expressed firm support for the Red Flag Headquarters, our headquarters immediately sent a welcome letter to all soldiers and officers, and various combat teams also sent welcome letters to various companies, expressing their love for the People's Liberation Army. Subsequently, the leadership of a certain unit and various companies also sent support letters to us. Each time letters were sent and received, everyone was educated and loved the Liberation Army and supported the Liberation Army even more.

We also held symposiums and heart-to-heart talks to deepen mutual understanding. We introduced to the Liberation Army the Red Flag Headquarters' struggle experience in the cultural revolution, honestly and comprehensively, both successes and shortcomings, to help them with their investigation and research work. In this way, the support-left troops quickly understood the class struggle situation within the organization and understood where the revolutionary masses were and where the conservatives were wrong.

We also organized some military-civilian joint celebrations, which were very helpful in deepening mutual class feelings and getting closer.

We and the support-left troops united and fought together, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, and severely struck at the small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

The facts have proven that the People's Liberation Army is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Actively and humbly learn from the Liberation Army

The great leader Chairman Mao calls on us: "The whole country should learn from the People's Liberation Army." The revolutionary masses of the proletariat should become models of learning from the Liberation Army.

The Liberation Army is good in a thousand ways, but the most important thing is that they hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We learn from the Liberation Army, the most fundamental and important thing is to learn from them how to emphasize proletarian politics and study and apply Chairman Mao's works. We held lectures and invited Liberation Army comrades to give speeches and share experiences. Everyone listened and unanimously felt that the Liberation Army's study of Chairman Mao's works is good, they study and apply what they learn, and dare to break with selfishness and establish public spirit. The Red Flag fighters discussed and said: We must strive to study and apply Chairman Mao's works like the Liberation Army, reform our thoughts, and overcome anarchism, sectarianism, individualism, and other non-proletarian thoughts. Comrades who participated in conservative organizations said: We must learn from the Liberation Army, fight selfishness to the end, carry out revolution in the depths of our souls, eliminate the poison of "Self-Cultivation," and quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

When we encountered problems in the struggle, we promptly sought advice from the support-left troops and sought their help. We also often invited leaders from the troops to various combat teams to talk about the situation and explain policies. For example, at one time, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party incited conservative organizations to engage in armed struggle. In this situation, some Red Flag fighters thought that whoever started the armed struggle, we would retaliate with armed struggle and stop armed struggle with armed struggle. After we reflected this problem to the responsible comrades of the troops, they helped us do in-depth and detailed ideological work, repeatedly publicized Chairman Mao's instruction to "use ideological struggle, not armed struggle," and listed various examples to illustrate the need to believe in the great power of Mao Zedong Thought and Party policies. In this way, these comrades' wrong emotions were quickly corrected.

We also learned from the Liberation Army's experience in political and ideological work. The Liberation Army is best at grasping living thoughts and best at using Mao Zedong Thought to solve people's ideological problems. The Agricultural and Pastoral Political Department had many participants in conservative organizations, and the support-left troops' soldiers and officers helped them do ideological work among the deceived masses, creating the experience of "two leads and two talks," that is, leading with the problem of the two-line struggle to Mao Zedong Thought to find answers and talk about the direction; leading with the deceived person's ideological problem to Mao Zedong Thought to find answers and talk about lessons. A comrade who participated in a conservative organization originally had great opposition to the revolutionary masses, but after the patient help of the Liberation Army and revolutionary masses, not only did his ideological problems clear up, but he also actively requested to join the Red Flag Headquarters.

To better learn from the Liberation Army, we established regular contact with the Liberation Army and implemented the pairing of combat teams with the Liberation Army. After pairing, heart-to-heart talks were universally held. After a certain unit of the Liberation Army paired with one of our combat teams, they also carried out one-on-one and one-to-one red activities.

In the future, we will better support the Liberation Army, better learn from the Liberation Army, strengthen our revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline, and under the support of the Liberation Army, we will combine the great criticism and struggle against the largest clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party with the struggle, criticism, and reform of our unit and department, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!

　　军民团结如一人　试看天下谁能敌
　　内蒙古自治区党委机关红旗联合总部
    当伟大的“一月革命”风暴席卷全国，无产阶级文化大革命进入夺权斗争的新阶段的时候，内蒙古地区党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派见到自己的末日已到，拚命向无产阶级革命派进行反扑。他们操纵保守组织围攻无产阶级革命派。正在这个关键时刻，人民解放军内蒙古军区某部的指战员，毫不犹豫地支持了内蒙古自治区党委机关的无产阶级革命派——红旗联合总部，粉碎了阶级敌人的阴谋。
    内蒙古军区某部的指战员，遵循毛主席的教导，首先在政治上支持无产阶级革命派。他们帮助红旗联合总部的战士活学活用毛主席著作，认真执行党的政策，掌握斗争的大方向；他们给我们带来了四个第一、三八作风的优良传统；他们帮助我们做受蒙蔽群众的思想工作，团结大多数群众，一道闹革命，壮大和发展了左派队伍。
    我们红旗战士热烈响应毛主席的拥军爱民的伟大号召，更加热爱人民解放军，积极进行了拥军活动。我们和人民解放军团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，建立了血肉相连的军民关系。
    坚定不移地相信和依靠人民解放军
    毛主席说：“没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。”毛主席最近又教导我们：要相信和依靠人民解放军。
    拥军问题，最根本的是对待人民解放军的态度问题，是坚决相信和依靠人民解放军的问题。我们反复教育红旗战士，要认识到人民解放军是毛主席缔造的、林彪副主席亲自指挥的军队，是无产阶级专政的强大支柱，是无产阶级革命派的坚强后盾；对人民解放军的态度，就是对无产阶级专政的态度，也是衡量是不是真正的革命左派的一个重要标志。
    阶级敌人最害怕解放军，最痛恨解放军，特别是最害怕人民解放军和无产阶级革命派的团结。因此，我们必须注意警惕阶级敌人挑拨军民关系的阴谋。在内蒙古军区某部表示支持我们后，旧内蒙古区党委内走资本主义道路当权派见势不妙，就利用保守组织盗用这个部队指战员的名义，在社会上散发了一个挑拨军民关系的传单。红旗战士们深有感触地说：在阶级敌人挑拨军民关系的阴谋诡计面前，如果不提高警惕，正确对待人民解放军，就会站错立场，做出亲者痛仇者快的事来。
    我们红旗战士遵照毛主席的教导，正确看待人民解放军支左工作中的主流和支流的关系。无产阶级文化大革命是政治、思想战线上一场极其复杂、极其尖锐的阶级斗争。人民解放军支援地方文化大革命是一个崭新的历史任务，因此在支左工作中，对某些问题看不准、处理不当的情况，是难以完全避免的。某部指战员开始和我们接近的时候，有少数同志受了社会上谣言的影响，对我们某些事情不理解、看不惯。我们红旗的一些战士，也同解放军同志存在一些隔阂。为了正确对待这个问题，我们及时引导大家学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“这些同志看问题的方法不对。他们不去看问题的本质方面，主流方面，而是强调那些非本质方面、非主流方面的东西。应当指出：不能忽略非本质方面和非主流方面的问题，必须逐一地将它们解决。但是，不应当将这些看成为本质和主流，以致迷惑了自己的方向。”按照毛主席这个教导，红旗战士们反复讨论后，一致认识到解放军指战员最听党的话，最忠于毛主席的革命路线，在关键时刻支持了无产阶级革命派。如果看不到这个本质方面和主流方面，就会迷失方向。因此，大家都注意做到不论在什么情况下，都强调要看部队支左工作的主流方面，成绩方面；对人民解放军有意见，就实事求是地提出来，通过双方的领导及时讨论解决。这样，很快和广大指战员建立了互相信任，互相帮助的亲密关系。
    在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的基础上，加强军民团结
    人民解放军和无产阶级革命派之所以心连心，是因为他们有着共同的立场、共同的思想感情，是因为他们都无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。我们体会到，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的基础上，和人民解放军加强团结，就是最好的拥军。
    要加强团结，就要加深彼此的了解。在红旗战士中，少数同志存在这样一种心理状态，认为自己既然是革命左派，就自然会受到人民解放军的支持，因而抱着消极等待支持的态度。这种想法是不对的。人民解放军支持革命左派要有一个了解和认识过程。我们应该主动帮助解放军更多地了解我们，主动地同解放军建立密切的关系，主动地争取解放军更大的支持。
    当解放军某部表示坚决支持红旗总部以后，我们总部就给全体指战员送去欢迎信，各战斗队也分别给各连队送去了欢迎信，表达热爱人民解放军的心情。随后，某部领导机关和各连队，也分别给我们送来支持信。每一次送信和接信活动，都使大家受到教育，更加热爱解放军，拥护解放军。
    我们还召开座谈会、谈心会，加深相互的了解。我们向解放军介绍红旗总部在文化大革命中的斗争经历，既讲成绩，又讲缺点错误，实事求是，力求全面，帮助他们进行调查研究工作。这样就使支左部队很快了解机关内部阶级斗争的情况，了解革命派对在哪里，保守派错在哪里。
    我们还注意搞一些军民联欢活动，这对加深相互间的阶级感情，互相接近，很有好处。
    我们和支左部队团结一致，共同战斗，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，狠狠地打击了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。
  事实证明，人民解放军是无限忠于毛主席，无限忠于毛泽东思想，无限忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的。
    积极地、虚心地向解放军学习
    伟大领袖毛主席号召我们：“全国学人民解放军。”无产阶级革命派应当成为学习解放军的模范。
    解放军千好万好，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗是第一好。我们向解放军学习，最根本、最重要的是学习他们突出无产阶级政治，活学活用毛主席著作的经验。我们举办了讲用会，请解放军同志作报告，谈经验。大家听了以后，一致反映，解放军对毛主席著作的学习就是好，学了就用，敢于破私立公。红旗战士在讨论中说：我们一定要象解放军那样努力活学活用毛主席著作，改造自己的思想，克服无政府主义、小团体主义、个人主义等非无产阶级思想。参加过保守组织的同志说：要象解放军那样，狠斗私字，在灵魂深处闹革命，肃清《修养》的流毒，尽快回到毛主席的革命路线上来。
    我们在斗争中遇到问题，就及时向支左部队请教，争取他们的帮助，还经常请部队的负责同志到各战斗队谈形势，讲政策。比如，有一个时期，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派唆使保守组织进行武斗。在这种情况下，红旗战士中有些同志认为，谁挑起武斗，我们就以牙还牙，要以武斗去制止武斗。我们把这个问题反映给部队的负责同志以后，他们帮助做了深入细致的思想工作，反复宣传毛主席的“要用文斗，不要用武斗”的指示，列举各种事例，说明要相信毛泽东思想和党的政策的强大威力。这样，很快就扭转了这些同志的错误情绪。
    我们还向解放军学习做政治思想工作的经验。解放军最善于抓活思想，最善于用毛泽东思想去解决人们的思想问题。农牧政治部参加保守组织的人较多，支左部队的指战员就帮助他们做受蒙蔽群众的工作，创造了“两带两谈”的经验，即带着两条路线斗争的问题，到毛主席著作中找答案，谈大方向；带着受蒙蔽者的思想问题，到毛主席著作中找答案，谈教训。有一个参加过保守组织的同志，原来和革命派的对立情绪很大，经过解放军和革命派的耐心帮助，不但思想问题搞通了，而且积极要求参加红旗总部。
    为了更好地向解放军学习，我们同解放军建立了经常的联系，实行了战斗队同解放军的班挂钩。挂钩之后，普遍举办了谈心会。解放军某部一班同我们的一个战斗队挂钩以后，还开展了一帮一、一对红的活动。
    今后，我们要更好地拥护解放军，更好地学习解放军，加强自己的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，在解放军的支持下，把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争和本单位本部门的斗批改紧密结合起来，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
