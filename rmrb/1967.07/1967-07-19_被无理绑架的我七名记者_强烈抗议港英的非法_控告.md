The fascist authorities of the British in Hong Kong today morning filed an illegal "indictment" against seven journalists from the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch and the *Wen Hui Bao*, *Ta Kung Pao*, and *Xin Wan Bao* newspapers, accusing them of the fabricated crime of "illegal assembly." These journalists immediately expressed strong protests against the British in Hong Kong's illegal "indictment."

The journalists from Xinhua News Agency and patriotic newspapers walked into the enemy's "court" with heads held high. They showed extreme contempt for the armed police lining the "court," angrily protesting the British in Hong Kong's illegal arrest and their illegal interference with the journalists' freedom to report news. The Xinhua News Agency journalists and patriotic newspaper journalists' righteous and unyielding attitude made the British in Hong Kong's "court" lose all its dignity, and the British "judge" was left in a state of utter disarray, finally announcing a postponement of three days for further "trial," in a vain attempt to further persecute these journalists.

The fascist atrocities of the British in Hong Kong cannot stand the light of day. When they filed their illegal "indictment," the families of the illegally arrested Xinhua News Agency journalists and patriotic newspaper journalists attempted to enter the courtroom to listen, but were brutally rejected. The British police even threatened them with guns, ordering them to leave immediately or face being shot. The arrogant attitude of the British police sparked great indignation among the families.

Representatives from the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch, wearing Chairman Mao's badges and holding the *Quotations from Chairman Mao*, stood in front of the "Governor's House," strongly protesting the British in Hong Kong's savage persecution of Xinhua News Agency journalists and other patriotic journalists.

    被无理绑架的我七名记者
    强烈抗议港英的非法“控告”
    据新华社香港十七日电  港英法西斯当局今天上午对被它无理绑架的新华社香港分社和《文汇报》、《大公报》、《新晚报》的七名记者，以所谓“非法集会”的莫须有罪名非法提出所谓“控告”。这些记者对港英当局的非法“控告”立即提出强烈抗议。
    新华社记者和爱国报纸记者昂首挺胸地走上敌人的“法庭”，他们极端藐视“法庭”上林立的武装警察，愤怒地抗议港英当局对他们进行非法逮捕，抗议港英当局非法干涉他们采访新闻的自由。新华社记者和爱国报纸记者大义凛然、坚贞不屈的态度，使港英“法庭”威风扫地，港英“法官”狼狈不堪，最后宣布押后三天再“审”，妄图对这些记者作进一步的迫害。
    港英当局的法西斯暴行是见不得阳光的，在它非法提出“控告”时，被非法逮捕的新华社记者和爱国报纸记者的家属要进去旁听，竟遭到横蛮拒绝。港英警察还用枪恫吓，要这些家属马上离开，否则就要开枪打死他们。港英警察的嚣张态度引起家属们的极大愤慨。（附图片） 
    新华社香港分社代表们胸佩毛主席像章，手捧《毛主席语录》，在“港督府”门前强烈抗议港英当局野蛮迫害新华社记者和其他爱国记者的法西斯暴行。                      新华社稿
