China's Chargé d'Affaires An Zhi Yuan on July 18 lodged the strongest protest with the head of the Far East Department of the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Li Haiqiu, over the Soviet revisionist authorities' unreasonable detention of mail from the Chinese Embassy.

The protest statement pointed out: The Soviet side is escalating a comprehensive anti-China campaign. Since last year, they have adopted illegal measures to detain and confiscate printed materials mailed from Beijing to the Chinese Embassy. On October 21 last year, the responsible person at the Moscow International Post Office, in the presence of Chinese Embassy diplomatic personnel, unreasonably detained 270 copies of "People's Pictorial" and 150 copies of "China Construction." The Chinese Embassy had previously, on November 2 last year, lodged a serious protest with the Soviet Ministry of Foreign Affairs over this grave incident, demanding that the Soviet side correct this extremely wrong practice and guarantee that similar incidents would not happen again. However, the Soviet side's aforementioned actions have not only shown no signs of abating but have instead escalated. They have subsequently detained a large number of other mail items sent from Beijing to the Chinese Embassy. Since January this year, the Moscow International Post Office has continued to detain "People's Pictorial" and "China Construction," as well as other various printed materials such as "Beijing Weekly." What is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese people is that the Soviet side has shamelessly detained the works and photographs of the greatest contemporary Marxist-Leninist, the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong. On June 9 this year, when Chinese Embassy personnel went to the Moscow Customs with a receipt to pick up mail packages sent from Beijing to the Embassy, the Soviet customs officials arbitrarily opened and inspected the packages and illegally confiscated part of the Embassy's cargo.

The statement solemnly declared: The Chinese Embassy is the diplomatic representative agency of the great socialist country of China stationed in the Soviet Union. It has the right to obtain from its home country all the relevant materials it needs and enjoys the diplomatic privileges fully guaranteed in international relations. The series of despicable acts by the Soviet revisionist authorities are, needless to say, an infringement on China's sovereignty and a blatant violation of the basic norms of international relations.

The statement pointed out that the series of despicable acts by the Soviet revisionist authorities are an attempt to completely tear up the relevant postal agreements between the two countries after they unilaterally tore up a series of agreements between China and the Soviet Union.

The statement emphasized: The Soviet revisionist authorities are filled with hatred and fear of the works and photographs of Comrade Mao Zedong, and of printed materials that report on China's foreign policy and domestic life under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. At the same time, they are slavishly helping the world's number one enemy, American imperialism, to openly publish and distribute its reactionary publications in the Soviet Union, turning a blind eye and providing cover for it. This fully exposes the ugly face of the Soviet revisionist leadership's collusion with the United States to oppose China.

The statement said: The great leader of the Chinese people, Chairman Mao, said: "Only the ideological system and social system of communism are surging forward with the momentum of a mighty torrent and the force of a thunderbolt, maintaining their youthful vigor throughout the world." Marxism-Leninism is an ideology that no reactionary force can suppress. The Soviet revisionist leadership's attempt today to block the spread of Mao Zedong Thought can only be like a mantis trying to stop a chariot, lifting a rock to drop it on one's own feet.

Chargé d'Affaires An Zhi Yuan demanded that the Soviet side immediately return all the mail it has illegally detained and ensure that similar incidents do not happen again. The statement solemnly pointed out: If the Soviet side continues to ignore the Chinese Embassy's solemn warning and persists in its actions, all consequences arising therefrom shall be borne by the Soviet side.

Li Haiqiu, after hearing the aforementioned statement, was at a loss for words in the face of the facts listed in the statement, not daring to mention a single word about these facts, and unreasonably "refused to accept" the aforementioned statement.

    我临时代办最严重抗议苏修无理扣押我使馆邮件
    苏修妄图阻挡毛泽东思想的传播是螳臂挡车
    新华社莫斯科二十日电　中国驻苏联大使馆临时代办安致远，十八日就苏联修正主义当局无理扣压我使馆邮件一事向苏联外交部远东司司长李海秋提出了最严重的抗议。
    抗议声明指出：苏联方面正在大肆加剧全面反华运动，去年以来，又对北京邮寄给中国大使馆的印刷品邮件进一步采取了非法的扣压和没收手段。去年十月二十一日，莫斯科国际邮局的负责人，竟然当着中国大使馆外交人员的面，毫无道理地扣压了《人民画报》二百七十多份、《中国建设》一百五十多份。中国大使馆去年十一月二日就此严重事件曾向苏联外交部作过交涉，严正要求苏联方面改变这种极端错误的作法，保证今后不再发生类似事件。但是，苏联方面的上述作法非但丝毫没有收敛，反而变本加厉，它们相继又扣压了北京邮寄给中国大使馆的大量其他邮件资料。从一九六七年一月起，莫斯科国际邮局不仅继续扣压了《人民画报》和《中国建设》，还扣压了《北京周报》等其他各种印刷品。而且，使中国人民绝对不能容忍的是，苏联方面竟然丧心病狂地把当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者、中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志的著作和照片也横加扣压。今年六月九日，当中国大使馆人员持提货单前往莫斯科海关提取北京邮寄使馆的邮包时，苏联的海关人员竟又擅自开包检查，并且当场非法地把大使馆的部分货运物品没收。
    声明严正表示：中国大使馆是伟大的社会主义中国派驻苏联的外交代表机构。它有权从本国得到它所需要的一切有关资料，并享有国际关系中予以充分保障的外交特权。苏修当局的这一系列卑劣行径，不言而喻，是对中国主权的侵犯，也是对国际关系起码准则的粗暴的践踏。
    声明指出，苏修当局这一系列卑劣行径，是它继单方面撕毁中苏之间一系列协议之后，又企图彻底撕毁两国有关邮电协定的行为。
    声明强调指出：对于毛泽东同志的著作和照片，对于以毛泽东思想为指导方针报道中国对外政策和国内生活的印刷品，苏修当局满怀仇恨，怕得要死。与此同时，对于世界人民头号敌人美帝国主义的反动刊物，苏修当局却奴相十足，帮它在苏联公开印发，大开绿灯，为之兜售。这就充分地暴露了苏联修正主义领导集团联美反华的丑恶嘴脸。
    声明说：中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席说：“惟独共产主义的思想体系和社会制度，正以排山倒海之势，雷霆万钧之力，磅礴于全世界，而葆其美妙之青春。”马列主义是任何反动势力也封锁不了的。苏联修正主义领导集团今天力图阻挡毛泽东思想的传播，这只能是螳臂挡车，搬起石头打自己的脚。
    安致远临时代办要求苏联方面立即退还被它非法扣压的一切邮件，切实保证今后不再发生类似事件。声明严正指出：如果苏联方面仍不正视中国大使馆的这一严正警告，依然一意孤行，由此而产生的一切后果，全部由苏联方面承担。
    李海秋在听完我上述声明后，在声明所列举的事实面前心虚理亏，无言以对，只字不敢提及这些事实，竟毫无道理地“拒绝接受”上述声明。
