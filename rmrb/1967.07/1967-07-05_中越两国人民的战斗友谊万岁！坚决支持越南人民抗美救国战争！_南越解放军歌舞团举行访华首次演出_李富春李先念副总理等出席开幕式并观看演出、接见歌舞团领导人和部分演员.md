The South Vietnamese Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe Holds Its First Performance in China

Vice Premiers Li Fuqun and Li Xiannian Attend the Opening Ceremony and Watch the Performance, Receive the Troupe Leaders and Some Performers

BEIJING, July 4 (Xinhua) — The South Vietnamese Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe, coming from the frontline of the anti-American struggle, held its first performance in China tonight.

Vice Premiers Li Fuqun and Li Xiannian, and Vice Chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress Guo Moruo attended the opening ceremony and watched the performance.

Tonight, the Capital Theater was filled with a warm atmosphere of combat unity between the peoples of China and Vietnam. On both sides of the stage and on the opposite wall, large banners read: "Long Live the Combat Friendship Between the Peoples of China and Vietnam!" "Resolutely Support the Vietnamese People's War of Resistance Against America!" "People of the World, Unite! Defeat the American Aggressors and All Their Running Dogs!"

Before the performance, a solemn opening ceremony was held. Vice Chairman of the Foreign Affairs Committee Chu Tuonan and the Director of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe, Nguyen Thuan Hung, spoke, enthusiastically praising the combat friendship between the peoples of China and Vietnam and strongly condemning the heinous crimes of American imperialism's aggression in Vietnam.

The performance began with the majestic songs "Liberate the South" and "The East Is Red." The South Vietnamese artists sang songs praising Chairman Ho Chi Minh's leadership in the Vietnamese people's revolutionary struggle, such as "The Forests of Bac Bo," and performed songs and dances reflecting the combat friendship between the peoples of Vietnam and China, which were enthusiastically received. They also performed many songs and dances reflecting the heroic deeds of the South Vietnamese military and people in their anti-American struggle, including the dance "The Victory Banner Flies High," which vividly depicts the South Vietnamese Liberation Army soldiers' fearless spirit in their fierce and tenacious battles against the American aggressors and their lackeys, raising the banner of victory high over the land of South Vietnam. Another dance, "The Female Guerrillas of Dong Tam," vividly reflects the brave and intelligent young women of the Dong Tam region who, while working hard in production, actively practice their combat skills, using knives and submachine guns to defeat the American invaders. The performance also included songs such as "The Song of the Liberation Army," "Building Fortifications," "To the Front," and "Advancing to Saigon," as well as Vietnamese national music and dances. The South Vietnamese artists, who came to Beijing with the deep friendship of the Vietnamese people for the Chinese people, sang revolutionary songs in Chinese praising Chairman Mao Zedong, the most beloved and respected leader of the Chinese people, such as "The Ship Sails on the Sea with the Helmsman" and "Long Live Chairman Mao." The entire audience was in a state of excitement, and the revolutionary fervor was overflowing. The audience repeatedly sang "Long Live Chairman Mao" in unison, and the rhythmic applause echoed throughout the theater. The South Vietnamese artists also sang and performed songs composed from Chairman Mao's poems, such as "For the Female Militia Member," and Chinese revolutionary songs such as "On the Golden Mountain in Beijing," "We Walk on the Great Road," "The March 8th Style Song," "The People of Asia, Africa, and Latin America Want Liberation," and "Victory Is with Us." These performances were enthusiastically received by the entire audience, and some were encored four or five times.

Most of the performers in the South Vietnamese Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe are combatants from various battlefields. In the war-torn South Vietnam, they serve the South Vietnamese military and people with their art while also clearing forests and engaging in agricultural production, and directly taking up arms to fight on the front lines against the American puppet army. The troupe was awarded the Second-Class Liberation Medal by the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front in 1964.

During the intermission, Li Fuqun, Li Xiannian, Guo Moruo, and other leaders received the Director of the South Vietnamese Liberation Army Song and Dance Troupe, Nguyen Thuan Hung, and other leaders and some performers, and had a friendly conversation with them. They also went on stage to express their warm congratulations after the performance ended.

The Deputy Head of the South Vietnamese National Liberation Front's Permanent Mission to China, Le Thong Son, and the Chargé d'Affaires of the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's Embassy in China, Nguyen Quang Huy, attended the opening ceremony and watched the performance.

Also present at the opening ceremony and watching the performance were relevant Chinese officials Zhang Zaiwo, Han Nianlong, Yuan Ziqin, Pan Zhenwu, Zhou Yiping, and others. (With photos)

    新华社四日讯　来自反美斗争最前线的越南南方解放军歌舞团，今晚在北京举行访问中国的首次演出。
    国务院副总理李富春、李先念，人大常委会副委员长郭沫若出席开幕式并观看了演出。
    今晚，首都剧场内洋溢着中越两国人民战斗团结的热烈气氛。舞台两侧和对面的巨幅标语上写着：“中越两国人民的战斗友谊万岁！”“坚决支持越南人民抗美救国战争！”“全世界人民团结起来，打败美国侵略者及其一切走狗！”
    演出前举行了隆重的开幕式。对外文委副主任楚图南和越南南方解放军歌舞团团长阮春鸿先后讲话，热情颂扬中越两国人民的战斗友谊，强烈谴责美帝国主义侵越战争的滔天罪行。
    演出在雄壮的《解放南方》和《东方红》的歌声中开始。越南南方文艺战士们演唱的歌颂胡志明主席领导越南人民进行革命斗争的《北坡的山林》等歌曲，和反映越中两国人民战斗友谊的歌舞，受到了极其热烈的欢迎。他们还演出了许多反映越南南方军民反美斗争英雄事迹的歌舞，其中有描写越南南方解放军战士以大无畏精神，同美国侵略者及其走狗进行英勇顽强的战斗，把胜利大旗高高飘扬在越南南方土地上的舞蹈《胜利的大旗高高飘扬》，以及舞蹈《同塔梅的女游击队》。《同塔梅的女游击队》生动地反映了聪明勇敢的同塔梅地区的女青年们，一边努力生产，一边积极练习杀敌本领，用长刀、冲锋枪打败美国侵略军的英雄事迹。演出的节目中，还有歌曲《解放军之歌》、《筑工事》、《上前线》、《向西贡前进》等，以及越南民族音乐和民族舞蹈。带着越南人民对中国人民的深厚友谊来到北京的越南南方文艺战士们，在用中国语演唱歌颂中国人民最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席的革命歌曲《大海航行靠舵手》和《万岁！毛主席》的时候，全场沸腾，革命激情洋溢，观众一次又一次地和唱“万岁！毛主席”“万岁！毛主席”，有节奏的掌声响彻全场。越南南方文艺战士们还演唱、独奏了用毛主席诗词谱写的歌曲《为女民兵题照》以及中国革命歌曲《在北京的金山上》、《我们走在大路上》、《三八作风歌》、《亚非拉人民要解放》、《胜利和我们在一起》等。这些节目受到了全场极为热烈的欢迎，有的谢幕四、五次。
    越南南方解放军歌舞团的大部分演员是来自各个战场上的战斗员。在战火纷飞的越南南方，他们一面用自己的艺术为南方军民服务，一面开山辟田从事农副业生产，并且直接拿起枪在第一线同美伪军搏斗。歌舞团在一九六四年曾受到越南南方民族解放阵线的嘉奖，荣获二级解放勋章。
    演出休息时，李富春、李先念、郭沫若等领导人，接见了歌舞团团长阮春鸿和歌舞团的其他领导人以及部分演员，同他们进行了亲切友好的谈话，并在演出结束时走上舞台表示热烈祝贺。
