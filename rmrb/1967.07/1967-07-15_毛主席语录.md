	People rely on us to organize. The reactionaries in China rely on us to organize the people to overthrow them. All reactionary elements, if you do not strike them down, they will not fall. This is similar to sweeping the floor; if the broom does not reach, the dust will not disappear on its own.

	From "The Situation and Our Policy After the Victory in the War of Resistance Against Japan"
