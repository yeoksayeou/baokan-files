The great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China has been born for 46 years. At this time of great victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we commemorate this glorious anniversary with boundless pride.

Under the leadership of the great leader Chairman Mao, the Communist Party of China has bravely struggled and sacrificed, transforming the old semi-feudal, semi-colonial China, riddled with holes and poverty, into a prosperous and vibrant great socialist country. In the struggle against imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, it has held high the banner of proletarian revolution and internationalism, defended Marxism-Leninism, and powerfully supported the revolutionary movements of the peoples of all countries, becoming the bulwark of the international communist movement.

Why has the Communist Party of China achieved such great victories? This is because our party is a party created and nurtured by the great leader Chairman Mao, a party established according to the revolutionary theory and revolutionary style of Mao Zedong Thought.

Mao Zedong Thought is a new stage in the development of Marxism. In our era, without Mao Zedong Thought, one fundamentally deviates from Marxism-Leninism and cannot establish a genuine Marxist-Leninist party. It is Mao Zedong Thought that illuminates our party's path to victory. All the victories of our party are the great victories of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the stage of democratic revolution, Chairman Mao criticized right opportunism and "left" opportunism, combining Marxism-Leninism with the concrete practice of the Chinese revolution, and opening up the path for the Chinese revolution. Under Chairman Mao's leadership, our party raised the banner of armed struggle, surrounding the cities from the countryside, and after decades of bloody battles, finally defeated Japanese imperialism, American imperialism, and their running dog, the reactionary Kuomintang led by Chiang Kai-shek, establishing a state of proletarian dictatorship. "The development, consolidation, and Bolshevization of our party were carried out in the midst of revolutionary war. Without armed struggle, there would be no Communist Party today."

After the victory of the democratic revolution, the right opportunists within the party spread various fallacies, attempting to halt the revolution and implement capitalism. At this crucial juncture, Chairman Mao corrected the course, criticized the right opportunist line, and led our party to transform the democratic revolution into a socialist revolution without interruption. In a short period, he guided five hundred million peasants onto the broad road of socialist collectivization and basically completed the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts.

In the Soviet Union, the traitorous clique of Khrushchev came to power, and the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, personally founded by Lenin, became a revisionist party, turning the first socialist state into a state of bourgeois dictatorship. Similar situations also occurred in some other socialist countries.

After the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production in our country, a current of capitalist restoration also emerged within our party. How can our country avoid changing color? How can our party avoid becoming a revisionist party? This is the most important and most concerned question posed by the proletariat and revolutionary people of the world to us. The great Communist Party of China is capable of answering this question and solving this problem. Because we have the brilliant leader Chairman Mao and the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

In turbulent times, the true colors of heroes are revealed. Our great leader Chairman Mao scientifically summarized the experience of class struggle in our socialist society, the historical experience of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and especially the bitter lessons of the Khrushchev revisionist clique's usurpation of the party and state leadership, proposing a set of theories and policies to prevent our party and our country from changing color.

Chairman Mao comprehensively, systematically, and scientifically expounded the theory of class, class contradictions, and class struggle in socialist society. He pointed out: "In this historical stage of socialism, there still exist classes, class contradictions, and class struggle, the struggle between the two roads of socialism and capitalism, and the danger of capitalist restoration. One must recognize the long-term and complex nature of this struggle. One must be vigilant. One must carry out socialist education. One must correctly understand and handle class contradictions and class struggle, correctly distinguish and handle contradictions between the enemy and us and contradictions among the people. Otherwise, our socialist country will turn to the opposite side, will change quality, and will experience a restoration."

To prevent revisionists from usurping the party leadership and to prevent capitalist restoration, Chairman Mao proposed that the entire party and the entire country must deeply and comprehensively carry out class struggle and the three great revolutionary movements; carry out socialist education, reorganize the revolutionary class ranks, and repel the fierce attacks of capitalist and feudal forces; in the great waves of class struggle, cultivate and train millions of successors to the cause of the proletarian revolution.

In recent years, Chairman Mao further developed the theory of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, pointing out that under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the main target of the revolution is the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. The theories, lines, policies, and measures formulated by Chairman Mao regarding the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as well as Chairman Mao's other series of works and instructions, are milestones in the development of Marxism, marking the development of Marxism to a new stage, the stage of Mao Zedong Thought.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, aims to solve the great revolution of preventing the dictatorship of the proletariat from degenerating into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, and also to solve the great revolution of preventing the proletarian party from degenerating into a revisionist party.

Under the dictatorship of the proletariat, the most prominent feature of class struggle is that the class enemy attempts to usurp the party and the state through a handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, turning the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and the Communist Party into a revisionist party. The handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road are the most dangerous enemies. To prevent our country and our party from changing color, we must launch the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, overthrow the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly eliminate their pernicious influence within the party and state organs, smash the ideology of the bourgeoisie, and establish the ideology of the proletariat, and in the entire party, establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Only by carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, can our party develop, grow stronger, and consolidate itself in the new stage of the socialist revolution. This is a great truth.

In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the greatest power-holder within the party who is taking the capitalist road, exposed by the broad revolutionary masses, has consistently opposed the great, invincible Mao Zedong Thought and attempted to turn our party into a revisionist party, a bourgeois party.

This greatest power-holder within the party who is taking the capitalist road, during the years of the War of Resistance Against Japan, did not advocate armed struggle, did not advocate seizing power, and merely talked about the "cultivation" of party members. After the victory of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he openly advocated the parliamentary road, urging the party to hand over the army to the Kuomintang and to go to the Kuomintang's parliament and reactionary government to "hold office." If we had followed his lead, our party would have degenerated into a revisionist party like the parties of Thorez and Togliatti, becoming a tool of the bourgeoisie.

This greatest power-holder within the party who is taking the capitalist road, after the nationwide victory, vigorously promoted the theory of "exploitation is meritorious," advocating that "capitalists should exist and develop for several decades," and advocating the development of "three horses, one plow, and one cart" style rich peasant economy, attempting to establish a capitalist society in China. To implement this reactionary political line, he shamelessly urged party members to lead in hiring workers, lead in exploitation, and absurdly said that "exploitation can still make one a socialist," that party members who become rich peasants "retain their party membership," that "there is no fear of ten thousand rich peasant party members in the Northeast," and that "party regulations and laws allow individual farming, allow hiring people, and it is dogmatism to not allow exploitation."

This is a complete betrayal of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought. Our party constitution clearly stipulates that "the Communist Party of China is the vanguard of the Chinese working class," aiming to "completely eliminate the system of exploitation in China" and "achieve communism." If, as the greatest power-holder within the party who is taking the capitalist road said, rich peasants and exploiters can be party members, and party members lead in exploitation, would our party not become the party of rich peasants and the exploiting class? No proletarian party has ever had "party regulations and laws" allowing party members to hire people or exploit. Only the "party regulations and laws" of a bourgeois party allow hiring people and exploitation.

This greatest power-holder within the party who is taking the capitalist road, after the basic completion of the socialist transformation of the ownership of the means of production in our country, vigorously promoted the theory of the extinction of class struggle, saying that "the main class struggle within the country has basically ended" and that "the question of who will defeat whom between socialism and capitalism has now been resolved." Like Khrushchev, he attempted to turn the Communist Party into a "party of the whole people." He advocated bringing a group of representatives of the bourgeoisie into the party and even openly said that "capitalists joining the party would be even better." He also said that "the most important task of the state is to organize social life" and that "the main task of the party is to rapidly develop the productive forces."

"Party of the whole people," this is pure deception. A party, like a state, is a tool of class struggle. As long as the Communist Party exists, it cannot be the party of the whole people. The so-called "party of the whole people" is actually a genuine bourgeois party. The central task of the Communist Party can only be to engage in class struggle, implement the dictatorship of the proletariat, and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. Not doing these things means it is not a genuine Communist Party. To erase the class nature of the state and society and talk about "organizing social life" and "developing productive forces" are all old revisionist tricks to deceive people. The set of ideas of the greatest power-holder within the party who is taking the capitalist road is of the same ilk as Khrushchev's advocacy of "economic and production issues being at the center of the party's activities and at the forefront of the party's entire work." If we follow his lead, just like the Soviet Union, the Marxist-Leninist party will definitely become a revisionist party, and the entire China will change color.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, exposed and overthrew the greatest power-holder within the party who is taking the capitalist road, smashed the counter-revolutionary revisionist line he promoted, and foiled his plot to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie and to turn our party into a revisionist party. This is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and it is the great victory of the construction of the party guided by Mao Zedong Thought.

Our party has the courage and the spirit to launch the great Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and to withstand the severe test of this great movement. This powerfully proves that our party is the strongest and highest-level Marxist-Leninist party.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "New and old things replace each other is a universal and irreversible law of the universe." Through the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we have eliminated the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and the broad masses of party members have undergone the tempering of revolutionary fire, while also adding fresh blood. Our party is even healthier, more vigorous, and more combative. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, rectifying the party in the midst of the mass movement has opened up a new era in the construction of the proletarian party.

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has purified the proletarian headquarters and greatly strengthened the party's leadership. The handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road say that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is "against the party's leadership." This is pure slander. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is carried out under the direct leadership of the Party Central Committee headed by the great leader Chairman Mao. This is the strongest and greatest leadership of the party. The so-called "party's leadership" of the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road is to issue orders themselves. This is absolutely impossible! The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is to remove their positions, seize their power, and overthrow their "leadership."

The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has proven that the broad masses of party members are good and relatively good, and the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road are only a small number. The broad masses of party members resolutely follow Chairman Mao's words, stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and fight against the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road. This is the mainstream and the most fundamental fact.

At the time of commemorating the 46th anniversary of the party's founding, the entire party and the people of the country should enthusiastically respond to the call of Comrade Lin Biao, Chairman Mao's close comrade-in-arms, to launch a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Comrade Lin Biao holds the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought the highest, studies Chairman Mao's works the best, and uses them the best. For decades, Comrade Lin Biao has consistently, firmly, and thoroughly executed Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The methods proposed by Comrade Lin Biao for studying Chairman Mao's works with questions in mind, studying and applying them actively, combining study and use, learning urgently what is needed immediately, and seeing results quickly, are effective and universally applicable, and should be promoted nationwide. Every Communist Party member should, in the blazing fire of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, use Mao Zedong Thought to transform oneself, smash the bourgeois worldview, establish the proletarian worldview, smash selfishness, and establish selflessness, and in one's mind, establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. Whatever is in accordance with Mao Zedong Thought should be resolutely executed and implemented, and whatever is against Mao Zedong Thought should be resolutely resisted and opposed, thoroughly abandoning and smashing the set of ideas of the greatest power-holder within the party who is taking the capitalist road, which is the slave ideology of the landlord and bourgeoisie. Comrades who are revolutionary cadres of the proletariat but have not joined the party should demand more of themselves, always and in everything take Mao Zedong Thought as the guide, constantly transform their thoughts, constantly progress, and strive to join the ranks of the Communist Party of China led by Chairman Mao.

At the time of commemorating the 46th anniversary of the party's founding, every Communist Party member should further understand and grasp the theories and policies of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution proposed by Chairman Mao, humbly learn from the masses, closely unite with the masses, and together with the masses, carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. One must firmly grasp the direction of struggle, thoroughly criticize the greatest handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and eliminate their poison on all fronts; one must actively promote the great alliance of the revolutionary cadres of the proletariat and the "three-in-one combination," and do a good job of struggle, criticism, and transformation in one's own unit; one must observe proletarian revolutionary discipline and earnestly implement the policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." In all these aspects, Communist Party members should play a leading and exemplary role. Some party members who have been deceived by the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie and poisoned by "Cultivation" and have participated in conservative organizations should quickly return to the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and learn from this, strive to be a genuine Communist Party member.

At the time of commemorating the 46th anniversary of the party's founding, every Communist Party member should always remember Chairman Mao's teachings, forever maintain the party's spirit of hard struggle, and guard against the attacks of the sugar-coated cannons of the bourgeoisie. The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has exposed the handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, and some of them have fallen because they could not resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideas. The lessons of the past should not be ignored. Especially for party members holding leading positions in revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations, after assuming power, their positions have changed, and they face new severe tests. The sugar-coated cannons of bourgeois ideas often attack us, so we must be highly vigilant.

We are proud to have Chairman Mao, the greatest and most brilliant leader. Comrade Mao Zedong is the greatest Marxist-Leninist of our time. Over the past 46 years, he has led our party to overcome one enemy after another, navigate one reef after another, and built our party into a completely mature Marxist-Leninist party. Our party having such a great leader is the highest honor of the entire party, the greatest happiness of the entire party and the people of the country. As a member of the great Communist Party of China, I feel extremely proud. Every party member should cherish the glorious title of Communist Party member, not disappoint Chairman Mao's expectations of us, and create new merits and new labor for the people, becoming a true Communist Party member.

Long live the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the great teacher, great leader, great helmsman, and great commander Chairman Mao!

　　毛泽东思想照亮了我们党胜利前进的道路
　　——纪念中国共产党诞生四十六周年
　　《红旗》杂志一九六七年第十一期社论
    伟大的光荣的正确的中国共产党诞生四十六周年了。在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的时候，我们以无比自豪的心情来纪念这个光辉的节日。
    中国共产党在伟大领袖毛主席领导下，英勇奋斗，流血牺牲，把百孔千疮、贫穷落后的半封建、半殖民地旧中国，变成为一个繁荣昌盛、朝气蓬勃的伟大的社会主义国家；在反对帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争中，高举无产阶级革命大旗，高举国际主义的大旗，捍卫了马克思列宁主义，有力地支援了各国人民的革命运动，成为国际共产主义运动的中流砥柱。
    中国共产党为什么能够取得这样伟大的胜利呢？这是因为我们的党是伟大领袖毛主席亲手缔造和培育起来的党，是按照毛泽东思想的革命理论和革命风格建立起来的党。
    毛泽东思想是马克思主义发展的新阶段。在我们时代，离开了毛泽东思想，就从根本上背离了马克思列宁主义，就不可能建立一个真正的马克思列宁主义的政党。正是毛泽东思想照亮了我们党胜利前进的道路。我们党的一切胜利，都是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    在民主革命阶段，毛主席批判了右倾机会主义和“左”倾机会主义，把马克思列宁主义和中国革命的具体实践结合起来，开辟了中国革命的道路。我们党在毛主席的领导下，高举武装斗争的大旗，由农村包围城市，经过几十年的浴血奋战，终于打败了日本帝国主义、美帝国主义及其走狗蒋介石反动派，建立了无产阶级专政的国家。“我们党的发展、巩固和布尔塞维克化，是在革命战争中进行的，没有武装斗争，就不会有今天的共产党。”
  民主革命胜利以后，党内的右倾机会主义者，散布种种谬论，力图把革命停顿下来，实行资本主义。在这个重要关头，毛主席端正航向，批判了右倾机会主义路线，领导我们党不停顿地把民主革命转变为社会主义革命。在短短的几年时间内，把五亿农民引上了社会主义集体化的康庄大道，基本上实现了资本主义工商业和手工业的社会主义改造。
    在苏联，赫鲁晓夫叛徒集团上了台，列宁亲自缔造的苏联共产党变成了修正主义的党，第一个社会主义国家变成了资产阶级专政的国家。其他一些社会主义国家也发生了这种情况。
    当我国生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成以后，我们党内也出现了一股资本主义复辟的暗流。我们的国家怎样才能不变颜色？我们的党怎样才能不变成修正主义的党？这是全世界无产阶级和革命人民向我们提出的最重要的和最关心的问题。伟大的中国共产党是能够回答这个问题的，是能够解决这个问题的。因为我们有天才的领袖毛主席，有战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    沧海横流，方显出英雄本色。我们伟大的领袖毛主席科学地总结了我国社会主义社会阶级斗争的经验，总结了国际无产阶级专政的历史经验，特别是总结了赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺党和国家领导权的惨痛教训，提出了防止我们党、我们国家改变颜色的一整套理论和政策。
    毛主席全面地、系统地、科学地阐明了社会主义社会的阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争的学说。他指出：“在社会主义这个历史阶段中，还存在着阶级、阶级矛盾和阶级斗争，存在着社会主义同资本主义两条道路的斗争，存在着资本主义复辟的危险性。要认识这种斗争的长期性和复杂性。要提高警惕。要进行社会主义教育。要正确理解和处理阶级矛盾和阶级斗争问题，正确区别和处理敌我矛盾和人民内部矛盾。不然的话，我们这样的社会主义国家，就会走向反面，就会变质，就会出现复辟。”
    为了防止修正主义篡夺党的领导，防止资本主义复辟，毛主席提出，要在全党全国深入地、全面地开展阶级斗争，开展三大革命运动；要开展社会主义教育运动，重新组织革命的阶级队伍，打退资本主义和封建势力的猖狂进攻；要在阶级斗争的大风大浪里，培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。
    近几年，毛主席进一步发展了关于无产阶级专政条件下进行革命的理论，指出无产阶级专政条件下，革命的主要对象是党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。毛主席制定的关于无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，以及毛主席其他一系列著作和指示，是马克思主义发展的里程碑，标志着马克思主义发展到了一个崭新的阶段，即毛泽东思想的阶段。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，目的是解决无产阶级专政不演变为资产阶级专政的大革命，也是解决无产阶级政党不蜕化为修正主义政党的大革命。
    在无产阶级专政条件下，阶级斗争的最大特点，就是阶级敌人力图通过钻进我们党内的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派篡党篡政，通过他们把无产阶级专政变为资产阶级专政，把共产党变成修正主义的党。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派是最危险的敌人。要防止我们的国家和我们的党改变颜色，只有发动无产阶级文化大革命，打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，彻底清除他们在党和国家机关内部造成的恶劣影响，大破资产阶级的意识形态，大立无产阶级的意识形态，在全党树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。只有开展无产阶级文化大革命群众运动，我们党才能在社会主义革命的新阶段得到发展、壮大和巩固。这是一个伟大的真理。
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，被广大革命群众揭露出来的党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，就是一贯地反对伟大的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，力图把我们党变成修正主义的党、资产阶级的党。
    这个党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在烽火连天的抗日战争的年代里，不讲武装斗争，不讲夺取政权，空谈党员“修养”。抗日战争胜利后，他公开鼓吹议会道路，要党把军队交给国民党，到国民党的议会里去，到国民党反动政府里去“做官”。照他这样去作，我们党就会堕落成多列士之流、陶里亚蒂之流的修正主义党，变成资产阶级的御用工具。
    这个党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在全国胜利以后，大肆宣扬“剥削有功”论，叫嚷“让资本家存在和发展几十年”，主张大力发展“三马一犁一车”式的富农经济，妄图在中国建立资本主义社会。为了实现这一条反动的政治路线，他无耻地要党员带头雇工，带头剥削，胡说什么“有剥削还可以做社会主义者”，党员成为富农“仍保留党籍”，“东北有一万富农党员也不怕”，“党规党法上允许单干，允许雇人，不准剥削是教条主义”。
    这是对马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的彻头彻尾的背叛。我们的党纲明确规定，“中国共产党是中国工人阶级的先进部队”，目的是在中国“彻底消灭剥削制度”，“实现共产主义”。如果象党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所说的那样，富农、剥削者可以作党员，党员带头剥削，我们的党岂不是成了富农的党、剥削阶级的党了吗？从来没有一个无产阶级政党的“党规党法”允许党员雇人、允许党员剥削。允许雇人、允许剥削的，只能是资产阶级政党的“党规党法”。
    这个党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在我国生产资料所有制的社会主义改造基本完成之后，大肆宣扬阶级斗争熄灭论，说什么“国内主要的阶级斗争已经基本上结束了”，“社会主义和资本主义谁战胜谁的问题，现在已经解决了”。他同赫鲁晓夫一样，企图把共产党变成“全民党”。他主张把一批资产阶级代表人物拉到党内来，甚至公开说资本家“入了党，则更好了”。他还说“国家最重要的任务是组织社会生活”，“党的主要任务，就是尽快的发展生产力”。
      “全民党”，这纯粹是骗人的鬼话。政党和国家一样，是阶级斗争的工具。只要共产党存在，就不可能是全民的。所谓“全民党”，实际上是不折不扣的资产阶级政党。共产党的中心任务只能是搞阶级斗争，实行无产阶级专政，加强无产阶级专政。不搞这些，就不是真正的共产党。抹煞国家的阶级性质，抹煞社会的阶级性质，而讲什么“组织社会生活”，讲什么“发展生产力”，这都是老修正主义的骗人把戏。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派这一套，同赫鲁晓夫所宣扬的“经济问题和生产问题居于党组织活动的中心，居于党组织整个工作的首位”，完全是一路货色。照他这样去做，就会象苏联一样，马列主义的党就一定会变成修正主义的党，整个中国就会改变颜色。
    毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命，揭露和打倒了党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派，摧毁了他所推行的反革命修正主义路线，粉碎了他要把无产阶级专政变成资产阶级专政、要把我们党变成修正主义党的阴谋。这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，这是以毛泽东思想为指南的党的建设的伟大胜利。
    我们党有胆量、有气魄，敢于发动伟大的无产阶级文化大革命，并且经受住这场伟大运动的严峻考验。这就有力地证明，我们的党是最坚强的、最高水平的马克思列宁主义政党。
    毛主席教导我们：“新陈代谢是宇宙间普遍的永远不可抵抗的规律。”通过无产阶级文化大革命，清除了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，广大党员经受了革命烈火的锻炼，同时增加新鲜的血液，我们党更加健康，更加生气勃勃，更富有战斗力。在无产阶级文化大革命的群众运动中整顿党，这在无产阶级政党的建设上，开创了一个新纪元。
    无产阶级文化大革命，纯洁了无产阶级司令部，大大加强了党的领导。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派说，无产阶级文化大革命是“不要党的领导”。这完全是污蔑。无产阶级文化大革命，是在以伟大领袖毛主席为首的党中央直接领导下进行的，这是最坚强的党的领导，最伟大的党的领导。党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派所谓的“党的领导”，就是要由他们来发号施令。这是绝对办不到的！无产阶级文化大革命，就是要罢他们的官，夺他们的权，打倒他们的“领导”。
    无产阶级文化大革命证明，我们党的广大党员是好的和比较好的，钻进党内的走资本主义道路的当权派，只是一小撮。广大党员，坚决听毛主席的话，站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派作斗争。这是主流，这是最基本的事实。
    在纪念党诞生四十六周年的时候，全党全国人民，应当热烈响应毛主席的亲密战友林彪同志的号召，掀起活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。林彪同志，毛泽东思想红旗举得最高，毛主席著作学得最好、用得最好。几十年来，林彪同志一贯最忠实、最坚定、最彻底地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。林彪同志提出的对毛主席著作要带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在用字上狠下功夫的方法，是行之有效、普遍适用的，应当在全国推广。每一个共产党员，都应当在无产阶级文化大革命的熊熊烈火中，用毛泽东思想来改造自己，大破资产阶级世界观，大立无产阶级世界观，大破私字，大立公字，在自己的头脑中树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。凡是符合毛泽东思想的，就坚决执行，坚决贯彻，凡是违背毛泽东思想的，就坚决抵制，坚决反对，彻底抛弃和粉碎党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所宣扬的那一套地主资产阶级的奴隶主义。没有加入党的无产阶级革命派同志，应该更严格地要求自己，处处、事事以毛泽东思想为指南，不断改造思想，不断进步，争取参加到毛主席领导的中国共产党的行列中来。
    在纪念党诞生四十六周年的时候，每一个共产党员，都应当进一步领会和掌握毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论和政策，虚心向群众学习，密切联系群众，同群众一起，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。要紧紧掌握斗争大方向，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，肃清他们在各条战线上的流毒；要积极促进无产阶级革命派的大联合和革命的“三结合”，搞好本单位的斗批改；要遵守无产阶级革命纪律，认真贯彻“抓革命，促生产”的方针。在所有这些方面，共产党员应该起带头作用，模范作用。一些由于受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽和《修养》毒害，参加过保守组织的党员，应该迅速回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来，并从中接受教训，努力做一个名副其实的共产党员。
    在纪念党诞生四十六周年的时候，每一个共产党员，都应该牢记毛主席的教导，永远保持党的艰苦奋斗的作风，防止资产阶级糖衣炮弹的攻击。文化大革命中揭露出来的党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，有一些就是因为不能抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀而堕落下去的。前车之覆，不可不鉴。特别是在各级革命委员会和革命群众组织中担任领导工作的党员，当权以后，地位改变了，面临着新的严峻考验，资产阶级思想的糖衣炮弹经常向我们袭击，千万提高警惕。
    我们有毛主席这样最伟大的天才领袖而感到无比骄傲。毛泽东同志是当代最伟大的马克思列宁主义者。四十六年来，他领导我们党战胜了一个又一个敌人，绕过了一个又一个暗礁，把我们党建成了一个完全成熟的马克思列宁主义的党。我们党有毛主席这样伟大的领袖，是全党的至高无上的荣誉，是全党和全国人民的最大的幸福。作为伟大的中国共产党的一员，感到无比的自豪。每一个党员都应当珍惜共产党员这个光荣称号，不辜负毛主席对我们的期望，为人民立新功，立新劳，作一个真正的共产党员。
    伟大的光荣的正确的中国共产党万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大的导师，伟大的领袖，伟大的统帅，伟大的舵手毛主席万岁！（附图片）
