The U.S. imperialist aircraft carrier "Hancock" brazenly entered Hong Kong waters this morning, bolstering the crumbling fascist rule of British imperialism in Hong Kong, intimidating the patriotic people of Hong Kong and Kowloon who are bravely fighting against British oppression, and provoking the Chinese people.

By 6 PM today, the U.S. warships anchored in Hong Kong waters, in addition to the "Hancock," include the destroyers "Carpenter," "Sprague," and four others. The "Hancock" is anchored in the shipping lane between Hong Kong's Central District and Kowloon's Tsim Sha Tsui, with bandit aircraft stationed on board. The patriotic people of Hong Kong and Kowloon are closely watching the "Hancock's" conspiratorial activities in Hong Kong.
