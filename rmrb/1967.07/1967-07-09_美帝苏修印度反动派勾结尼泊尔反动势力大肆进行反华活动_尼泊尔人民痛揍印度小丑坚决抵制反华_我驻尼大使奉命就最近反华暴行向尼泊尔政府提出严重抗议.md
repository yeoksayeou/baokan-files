The U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and Indian reactionaries have colluded with Nepalese reactionary forces to carry out extensive anti-China activities in Nepal, undermining the friendly relations between the peoples of Nepal and China.

On the evening of July 1, a group of Nepalese hooligans, incited and directed by the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and Indian reactionaries, with the tacit approval of the Nepalese government, gathered in front of the Chinese Picture Exhibition Hall in Kathmandu to engage in anti-China activities. They repeatedly attempted to storm the exhibition hall, shouting slogans to remove the portraits of Chairman Mao Zedong, the great leader of the Chinese people, and the Chinese national flag from the hall. The hooligans also shouted anti-China slogans and maliciously slandered our dearest and greatest leader, Chairman Mao, the red sun in our hearts. Nepalese progressive students, who cherish the friendship between the peoples of Nepal and China and love the great teacher of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, rushed to the exhibition hall to defend the portrait of Chairman Mao. They said, "We will defend Chairman Mao with our blood," "We will always be loyal to Chairman Mao," and "We will fight to the end against the Indian reactionaries."

This despicable anti-China violence aroused the strong indignation of the Nepalese people present. They repeatedly shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live Nepal-China friendship!" and other slogans, preventing the hooligans from entering the Chinese Picture Exhibition Hall to carry out destructive activities. The second secretary of the Indian Embassy, Singh, who participated in the planning of this anti-China violence, saw that their anti-China plot had not completely succeeded. He took off his shirt and, in a fit of rage, physically assaulted the Nepalese people who were defending the friendship between the peoples of Nepal and China. The shameless violence of the Indian reactionaries aroused the great indignation of the Nepalese people, who immediately gave this reactionary a beating on the spot.

The Nepalese hooligans also threw stones at the Chinese Embassy, the Xinhua News Agency's Kathmandu branch, and the cars of the Chinese expert group, injuring a Chinese diplomat.

The anti-China violence in Nepal was orchestrated with a plan by the U.S. imperialists, Soviet revisionists, and Indian reactionaries. There are reports that the U.S. "Peace Corps" and military personnel are backing the anti-China hooligans. The U.S. Embassy sent personnel to various universities in Nepal to spread rumors attacking China and incite students to engage in anti-China activities. Before the hooligans stormed the Chinese Picture Exhibition Hall, they first gathered inside the U.S. exhibition hall. At that time, some members of the U.S. "Peace Corps" were also present.

The Soviet Embassy was particularly busy during those days. The TASS correspondent in Nepal openly incited Nepalese students and journalists to oppose China.

The Nepalese government agreed with and supported this anti-China violence. In the past half year, Nepalese reactionary newspapers have continuously published articles slandering China. The Nepalese reactionary forces also banned Nepalese students from wearing Chairman Mao's badges and carrying the "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong." Before the hooligans carried out this anti-China action, the Nepalese government was aware of it. When the hooligans were committing their crimes, the Chinese side repeatedly requested the Nepalese government to stop the anti-China violence, but the Nepalese government ignored it. When the hooligans were committing their crimes, the commissioner of the Bagmati Zone of Nepal was present on the scene. Chinese personnel repeatedly protested to him in person about the anti-China violence of the hooligans and demanded that immediate measures be taken to stop it, but he was very rude.

On July 4, on the instructions of the Chinese government, Chinese Ambassador to Nepal Yang Gongsu lodged a serious protest with the Nepalese government over this anti-China violence. Ambassador Yang Gongsu pointed out that this anti-China incident was a great insult to the Chinese people and a serious violation of Chinese diplomatic privileges. This anti-China incident was planned by U.S. imperialism and Indian reactionaries and was supported and approved by the Nepalese government. Ambassador Yang Gongsu also pointed out that this incident once again proves that imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries are using all means to create incidents in various places, especially in China's neighboring countries, to stir up anti-China sentiment and undermine the friendly relations between these countries and China. The reactionary forces in the Nepalese government that follow imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries are becoming active. Ambassador Yang Gongsu emphasized that great socialist China is not to be insulted. Imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries who engage in anti-China activities will definitely suffer a crushing defeat. Whoever follows them to engage in anti-China activities will reap what they sow.

The Chinese people, armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, are closely watching the development of this situation.

　　美帝苏修印度反动派勾结尼泊尔反动势力大肆进行反华活动
　　尼泊尔人民痛揍印度小丑坚决抵制反华
　　我驻尼大使奉命就最近反华暴行向尼泊尔政府提出严重抗议
    据新华社八日讯　加德满都消息：美帝、苏修和印度反动派勾结尼泊尔反动势力，最近在尼泊尔大肆进行反华活动，破坏尼中两国人民友好关系。
    七月一日晚间，一批尼泊尔暴徒受美帝、苏修和印度反动派的煽动指挥，在尼泊尔政府的纵容下，到加德满都的中国图片展览馆前面进行反华活动。他们几次企图冲进展览馆，狂喊要取下馆内的中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席的像片和中国国旗。暴徒还呼喊反华口号，恶毒地污蔑我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席。无限热爱世界革命人民的伟大导师毛主席，珍视尼中两国人民友谊的尼泊尔进步学生，特地赶到展览馆来保卫毛主席像。他们说：“我们要用鲜血保卫毛主席”，“我们永远忠于毛主席”，“誓死同美印反动派战斗到底。”
    这种卑鄙的反华暴行，激起了在场的尼泊尔人民的强烈愤怒。他们一再高呼：“毛主席万岁！”“尼中友好万岁！”等口号，制止暴徒进入中国图片展览馆进行破坏活动。参与策划这次反华暴行的印度大使馆二等秘书辛格看到他们的反华阴谋没有完全得逞，竟赤膊上阵，气急败坏地动手殴打维护尼中两国人民友谊的尼泊尔人。印度反动分子这种无耻暴行激起了尼泊尔人民的极大愤慨。他们当场把这个反动家伙痛打一顿。
    尼泊尔暴徒还向中国大使馆、新华社加德满都分社和中国专家组的汽车投掷石头，打伤一名中国外交人员。
    尼泊尔的这次反华暴行，是在美帝、苏修、印度反动派互相勾结之下，有计划地策动的。有消息说，美国“和平队”和军事人员正在背后支持反华暴徒。美国大使馆派出人员到尼泊尔各大学去散布攻击中国的谣言，煽动学生反华。在暴徒冲击中国图片展览馆以前，他们曾先在美国展览馆内集合。当时，一些美国“和平队”队员也在场。
    苏联大使馆在那几天显得特别繁忙。塔斯社驻尼泊尔记者还公开煽动尼泊尔学生和记者反对中国。
    尼泊尔政府对于这次反华暴行是同意和支持的。近半年来，尼泊尔的反动报纸不断发表诽谤中国的文章。尼泊尔反动势力还禁止尼泊尔学生佩戴毛主席像章，禁止携带《毛主席语录》。在暴徒们采取这次反华行动以前，尼泊尔政府是知道的。暴徒行凶时，中国方面曾经一再要求尼泊尔政府制止反华暴行，但尼泊尔政府竟置之不理。在暴徒逞凶时，尼泊尔的巴格玛蒂大区专员就在现场。中国人员再三就暴徒的反华暴行向他提出口头抗议，要求立即采取措施予以制止，但他态度十分恶劣。
    中国驻尼泊尔大使杨公素奉中国政府之命，于七月四日就这次反华暴行向尼泊尔政府提出严重抗议。杨公素大使指出：这次反华事件，是对中国人民的极大侮辱，是对中国外交特权的严重侵犯，这次反华事件是美帝国主义和印度反动派策划的，是得到尼泊尔政府的同意和支持的。杨公素大使还指出：这次事件再次证实，帝修反正在不择手段地在各地，特别是在中国的邻国制造事端，掀起反华，破坏这些国家同中国的友好关系。尼泊尔政府中追随帝修反的反动势力蠢蠢欲动。杨公素大使强调说：伟大的社会主义中国是不可侮的。帝修反反华，一定要碰得头破血流。谁追随它们一道反华，谁就要自食其果。
    用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，正在密切注视着这一事态的发展。
