The news of the revolutionary teachers and students of Beijing Aviation Institute resuming classes and making revolution has sparked a strong response among the revolutionary teachers and students of various colleges and universities in Tianjin. Broad revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, upon hearing the news, have taken action, holding discussion meetings and writing big-character posters, expressing their determination to take the great leader Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" as the highest guideline and resume classes and make revolution.

Tianjin Institute of Physical Education, Hebei Institute of Finance and Economics, Tianjin Conservatory of Music, Hebei Institute of Textile Engineering, and Hebei Institute of Light Industry have all started school-wide resumption of classes and making revolution. Some classes in Tianjin University and Tianjin Medical College have also started resuming classes and making revolution.

Resuming classes and making revolution is a universal demand of the revolutionary teachers and students in various colleges and universities in Tianjin. They unanimously believe that resuming classes and making revolution is a major issue concerning whether the proletarian cultural revolution in colleges and universities can be carried through to the end. It is an important guarantee for strengthening and improving the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of revolutionary teachers, students, and staff, and for establishing a new revolutionary order. The revolutionary teachers and students of various colleges and universities have expressed their determination to better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, deeply criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly criticize the revisionist educational line, thoroughly smash the capitalist and revisionist educational system, thoroughly reform the old educational policies and teaching methods, create a brand-new socialist educational system in human history, and turn colleges and universities into red-hot schools of Mao Zedong Thought.

In recent days, various colleges and universities in Tianjin have successively held oath-taking meetings for resuming classes and making revolution. Various schools have also, through discussion meetings, linkage meetings, and discussion meetings, mobilized the masses extensively, using the forms of big debates, big-character posters, big discussions, and big criticisms, to concentrate the opinions of the masses. In accordance with Chairman Mao's teaching of "learning as the main focus, learning other things as well, that is, not only learning literature but also learning industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticizing the bourgeoisie," combined with the actual situation of various schools, daring to practice and daring to create, they have formulated plans and measures for resuming classes and making revolution. Various schools have all placed the study of Chairman Mao's works in the first position in their plans for resuming classes and making revolution. Currently, the focus is on big criticism, struggle, criticism, and transformation, gradually transitioning to "learning as the main focus" in the future.

First, give a good class on revolutionary criticism

Three colleges in Inner Mongolia resume classes and make revolution

According to Xinhua News Agency, Hohhot, July 18th—Inner Mongolia Agricultural College, Inner Mongolia Institute of Technology, and Inner Mongolia University, among other colleges and universities, have begun resuming classes and making revolution amidst the high tide of revolutionary criticism. Other colleges and universities are also actively creating conditions to achieve the resumption of classes and making revolution.

The broad revolutionary teachers and students of various colleges and universities in Hohhot, upon hearing the news of Beijing Aviation Institute resuming classes and making revolution, have taken action, launching a big discussion on resuming classes and making revolution. Some revolutionary teachers and students who are outside have also returned to school in large numbers. Currently, various schools present a lively revolutionary new scene.

Broad revolutionary teachers and students believe that resuming classes and making revolution is an important measure to combine revolutionary criticism with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units; resuming classes and making revolution signifies that the proletarian cultural revolution on the educational front has entered a new stage. Revolutionary teachers and students of Inner Mongolia Agricultural College said, Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" is the highest guideline for our educational revolution, a verdict on the reactionary educational system of several thousand years, and a battle cry for us to charge against the reactionary educational system of the bourgeoisie and revisionism. We must give a good class on Mao Zedong Thought, give a good class on big criticism, and thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois and revisionist educational line they promote, politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and turn the school into a red-hot school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Currently, the focus of resuming classes and making revolution in the three colleges, including Inner Mongolia Agricultural College, is on big criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, gradually transitioning to "learning as the main focus, learning other things as well" in the future.

Uphold Chairman Mao's revolutionary educational line

A batch of colleges in Xi'an resume classes and make revolution

According to Xinhua News Agency, Xi'an, July 18th—After the news of Beijing Aviation Institute resuming classes and making revolution on July 5th, the broad revolutionary teachers and students of various colleges and universities in Xi'an have all firmly expressed their determination to learn from the North Aviation comrades. Recently, Xi'an Jiaotong University, Xi'an Institute of Military Communication Engineering, and Xi'an Institute of Metallurgy and Architecture, among other schools, have successively begun resuming classes and making revolution.

The resumption of classes and making revolution in Xi'an colleges and universities takes Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" as the highest guideline for struggle. Currently, the focus is on big criticism, gradually transitioning to "learning as the main focus" in the future. Broad revolutionary teachers and students believe that resuming classes and making revolution requires more diligent study of Chairman Mao's works, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly grasping the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines as the key, launching a more extensive and in-depth mass movement of big criticism and struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit. At the same time, they should contribute their own efforts to the great alliance of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Shaanxi Province and Xi'an region and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Currently, these schools have entered a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. On the first day of announcing the resumption of classes and making revolution, Xi'an Institute of Metallurgy and Architecture held its first class, inviting active members of the People's Liberation Army to study Chairman Mao's works to share their experiences. Revolutionary teachers and students of Xi'an Jiaotong University have decided to, in the resumption of classes and making revolution, wield the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, thoroughly criticize the power-holders taking the capitalist road in this region and unit, thoroughly criticize the reactionary line of the bourgeoisie, severely criticize the bourgeois and revisionist educational line, thoroughly smash the bourgeois educational system, teaching policies, and methods, shatter the so-called "old Jiaotong tradition" of "high threshold, strict requirements, thick foundation, thin specialty," firmly establish Chairman Mao's revolutionary educational line, firmly establish the proletarian educational system, teaching policies, and methods, and turn Xi'an Jiaotong University into a school of Mao Zedong Thought.

In the resumption of classes and making revolution, broad revolutionary teachers and students have seriously discussed how to gradually implement Chairman Mao's instructions on "learning industry, agriculture, and military affairs." Currently, many classes in colleges and universities have begun to take action. Some students go to the school's affiliated factories to learn, some go to the public affairs class to learn carpentry; some students learn to weed and level the ground in the campus.
