A revolutionary organization in a school in Beijing announced that it would open its doors for self-criticism, inviting all revolutionary teachers and students to offer their opinions. Some people raised sharp criticisms, but the leaders of this organization, upon hearing this, thought that someone was trying to take advantage of the situation to overthrow them. They falsely labeled these criticisms as "malicious attacks with ulterior motives." As a result, many who had intended to offer their opinions decided not to. However, privately, they began to discuss: they opened the door for self-criticism, but it turned out there was a "guard post" at the door. Who would dare to offer opinions?

Some members of this revolutionary organization heard these discussions and were enlightened. They raised serious criticisms to the leadership core. After discussion, the leadership core admitted their mistake to all the students, announcing the removal of the "guard post" and truly achieving "speak without fear, listen without prejudice." The door for self-criticism by the revolutionary organization was truly opened to the masses, and the opinions of the masses were truly opened to the revolutionary organization. The revolutionary organization heard many beneficial criticisms and opinions that they had not heard before.

Through self-criticism, the prestige of this revolutionary organization among the masses increased, and its combat effectiveness was enhanced.

Revolutionary organizations that open their doors for self-criticism must truly trust the masses. If they do not trust the masses, even if they open the door, they will still set up "guard posts." In this way, "speakers have no guilt" may turn into "speakers have guilt," and "listeners take heed" may turn into not taking heed of themselves but warning the masses. As a result, the door for self-criticism can only be open in form but closed in reality.

Since we are a revolutionary organization, we should trust the revolutionary masses. Even if the masses raise some sharp criticisms, it is out of love and concern for us, to help us. The experience of the aforementioned school's revolutionary organization proves that opening the door wide for self-criticism to the masses is not about "toppling" ourselves but about "strengthening" ourselves.

There will definitely be people with "ulterior motives" and "malicious attacks," but they are only a very small number, and we should also believe that such people cannot escape the keen eyes of the revolutionary masses. The main way to deal with such people is to rely on the revolutionary masses, not on the "guard posts" of the revolutionary organization. Only the revolutionary masses are the iron wall protecting the revolutionary organization.

### 开门又撤“岗”

    开门又撤“岗”
    北京有一个学校的革命组织，宣布开门整风，要求全校广大革命师生给他们提意见。有人提出了一些尖锐的批评，这个组织的一些负责人一听，以为有人想借机整垮他们。于是，就把这种批评错误地说成是“别有用心”的“恶意攻击”。这一来，许多本来要提意见的人，也就不再提意见了。可是，私下里却议论起来：他们整风的门虽然开了，可是没想到门口却站着“岗”，谁还敢提意见！
    这个革命组织的一些战士，听到了这种议论，很受启发，就对领导核心提出了严肃的批评。领导核心经过讨论，向全校同志承认了错误，宣布撤去“岗哨”，真正做到“知无不言，言无不尽，言者无罪，闻者足戒”。革命组织整风的门真正向群众敞开了，群众的意见也真正向革命组织敞开了。革命组织听到了不少过去听不到的有益的批评和意见。
    经过整风，这个革命组织在群众中的威信更高了，战斗力更强了。
    革命组织，要开门整风，就要真正信任群众。如果不信任，即使开了门，还会设下“岗”。这样“言者无罪”就有可能变成“言者有罪”，“闻者足戒”也就会颠倒为不是戒自己，而是戒群众。结果，整风之门只能是形开而实闭。
    我们既然是革命组织，就应当信任革命群众。群众即使有些意见提得尖锐，也是为了爱护自己，帮助自己。上述这个学校的革命组织的经验证明，向群众敞开大门整风，不是把自己“整垮”了，而是把自己“整强”了。
    “别有用心”“恶意攻击”的人是肯定会有的，但毕竟只是极个别的，而且也要相信这样的人是逃不脱广大革命群众的雪亮眼睛的。对付这样的人，主要也是靠广大革命群众，而不是靠革命组织的“岗哨”。只有广大革命群众，才是保护革命组织的铜墙铁壁。
