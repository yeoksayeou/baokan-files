Congolese (Brazzaville) Militiamen Vow Never to Lay Down Their Arms
The Armed People Are Invincible

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Brazzaville, Congolese (Brazzaville) militiamen enthusiastically praise Mao Zedong Thought, believing that Chairman Mao's brilliant ideas on people's war are a "reliable guarantee for safeguarding national independence."

A militiaman from the Lumumba Camp in Congo (Brazzaville) recently finished reading Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On Protracted War." He said, "Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war have infinitely inspired the people's confidence in defeating the enemy. Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war are the only magic weapon to defeat the aggressors. Once this magic weapon is grasped by the people of all countries, imperialism and colonialism will be doomed!"

He said, "Chairman Mao's thoughts on people's war are a reliable guarantee for safeguarding national independence. An organized and armed people are invincible."

A militiaman stationed in the suburbs of the Congolese (Brazzaville) capital said, "Chairman Mao said, 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun,' which is absolutely right. In the past, without guns, imperialism bullied us; today, we have picked up guns, and imperialism dares not act rashly." He concluded, "I understand the importance of guns, so I will never put them down."

Congolese (Brazzaville) militiamen love reading Chairman Mao's books. They study Chairman Mao's works while defending their country's independence and fighting against U.S. imperialism and its lackeys, drawing boundless wisdom and strength from them. (Accompanying photo)

　　刚果（布）民防队员表示永不放下枪杆子
    武装起来的人民是不可战胜的
    据新华社布拉柴维尔电　刚果（布）民防队员热情赞扬毛泽东思想，认为毛主席关于人民战争的光辉思想是“维护民族独立的可靠保证”。
    刚果（布）卢蒙巴营的一位民防队员不久前刚刚读完毛主席的光辉著作《论持久战》。他说：“毛主席人民战争的思想无限地鼓舞了人民去战胜敌人的信心，毛主席人民战争的思想是战胜侵略者的唯一法宝。这个法宝一旦被各国人民所掌握，帝国主义、殖民主义就要完蛋！”
    他说，“毛主席的人民战争思想是维护民族独立的可靠保证，组织和武装起来的人民是不可战胜的”。
    在刚果（布）首都城郊驻防的一位民防队员说：“毛主席说‘枪杆子里面出政权’，太对了。过去没有枪，帝国主义欺负我们；今天我们拿起枪，帝国主义就不敢轻举妄动了。”他最后说：“我懂得了枪的重要，就永远不放下它”。（附图片）
