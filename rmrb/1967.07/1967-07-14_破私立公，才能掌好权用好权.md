In the great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our proletarian revolutionary faction seized the power of the party, government, finance, and culture from a handful of capitalist-roaders within the old *Guizhou Daily*, reoccupied this propaganda front, and established the *New Guizhou Daily* Revolutionary Committee.

We have been entrusted by the broad revolutionary masses and selected as members of the Revolutionary Committee. Our status has changed. How to do a good job in leading work is a test for us. Several months of practice have made us deeply realize that the most fundamental thing is to redouble our efforts to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, use the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to resolutely overthrow the "private" in our minds, and establish the "public." Only in this way can we wield power properly.

First, overthrowing the private and establishing the public is the key to resolutely carrying out Chairman Mao's instructions and firmly implementing the party's policies.

In January of this year, Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee approved the seizure of power by the proletarian revolutionary faction in Guizhou Province. This is the greatest support and encouragement for us. In this favorable situation, we quickly divided and dissolved the conservative organizations within the newspaper office politically and organizationally. At this time, the question of how to correctly handle the issue of the masses who were deceived into joining conservative organizations became prominent. Should we also surround and criticize those who were deceived? We timely summarized the experiences and lessons of the movement and believed that surrounding and criticizing those who were deceived is not in line with Chairman Mao's teachings and the party's policies. Chairman Mao teaches us to adopt the policy of "punishing the past to prevent the future, curing the sickness to save the patient" towards cadres and masses who make mistakes. Chairman Mao also teaches us: The proletariat not only needs to liberate itself but also needs to liberate all of humanity. If the proletariat cannot liberate all of humanity, it cannot ultimately liberate itself. Proletarian revolutionary comrades, in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, discussed and issued a statement, proposing to strictly act according to the party's policies and unite the majority. After seizing power, some comrades who had been persecuted by the capitalist reactionary line could not well unite, educate, and organize the deceived masses. This is an expression of the "private." We should see that a handful of capitalist-roaders within the newspaper office incited the masses to fight each other, deceived and used conservative organizations to suppress revolutionary masses, causing serious antagonism among the masses. The deceived masses are also victims of the capitalist reactionary line. We should help them raise their consciousness and change direction. If we act out of emotion, we will not be able to achieve the goal of uniting the majority and completely isolating the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party.

We proletarian revolutionaries adopt the method of "unity-criticism-unity" to carry out in-depth and detailed political and ideological work for the deceived masses, such as individual talks and holding symposiums. We believe that this is not about compromise or muddling through. If we act out of the "private" and dare not firmly implement the party's policies, then we are wrong. We strictly distinguish between the two types of contradictions and correctly handle internal contradictions among the people. Through patient help, some deceived masses realized their mistakes and returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, successively joining revolutionary mass organizations.

Second, overthrowing the private and establishing the public is the key to believing in the masses, relying on the masses, and mobilizing the masses.

Our most beloved and respected great leader Chairman Mao personally approved the experience of the Guiyang Cotton Mill in achieving great unity from the bottom up according to administrative departments. We were greatly inspired, and many comrades expressed their desire to follow the path of the Guiyang Cotton Mill. We believe that the proletarian revolutionary faction of the *New Guizhou Daily* has already taken the upper hand, and the conditions for achieving great unity according to administrative departments are basically ripe. At that time, the newspaper office already had relatively large and influential revolutionary mass organizations. Can we achieve great unity among proletarian revolutionary factions according to administrative departments? This organization plays a very important role. On the day the experience of the Guiyang Cotton Mill was published in the newspaper, this organization, after discussion, unanimously expressed their determination to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions and achieve great unity with other revolutionary mass organizations according to administrative departments. They proposed the initiative to achieve great unity according to administrative departments, which was supported and responded to by some brother units. The revolutionary mass organizations of the newspaper printing plant took even faster action, implementing great unity at the same time the initiative was proposed. This played a promoting role in the entire newspaper office achieving great unity according to administrative departments from the bottom up and in the great unity between revolutionary intellectuals and the working class.

However, some comrades within the proletarian revolutionary faction did not understand the initiative proposed by this organization and put forward some opinions that obstructed the rapid achievement of great unity. The initiative proposed by this organization is an expression of overthrowing the private and establishing the public. If we act out of the "private," in terms of "mountains," their "mountain" is the largest; in terms of "signs," this "sign" is also well-known. Doing so is to better unite and form a vast revolutionary army to launch a fierce attack on the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. We believe that the masses will definitely be able to use Mao Zedong Thought to distinguish right from wrong, and as long as we do things right, the masses will definitely support us. Therefore, within the proletarian revolutionary faction, a great debate was launched. Through the debate, the broad proletarian revolutionary fighters more clearly saw the benefits of achieving great unity according to administrative departments, actively connected, and achieved great unity from the bottom up according to administrative departments in just a few days.

Third, overthrowing the private and establishing the public is the key to upholding principles and fighting against various erroneous thoughts.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We advocate active ideological struggle because it is a weapon for achieving unity within the party and revolutionary organizations and making them more combat-ready. Every Communist Party member and revolutionary should take up this weapon."

After seizing power, the broad proletarian revolutionary faction actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, consciously observed proletarian revolutionary discipline, and seriously implemented the resolutions of the Revolutionary Committee. At the same time, they actively put forward many criticisms and suggestions, which played a significant role in helping and supervising us to overthrow the private and establish the public, and improve our work style. However, internal contradictions among the people became prominent, and some non-proletarian thoughts, such as anarchism and ultra-democratism, were reflected within the proletarian revolutionary faction. These erroneous thoughts played a role in dispersing revolutionary will and corrupting revolutionary organizations. Some comrades could not tolerate criticism, and if someone raised a different opinion, they would say it was suppressing democracy. Sometimes, work and struggle tasks required some demands and opinions to be put forward from top to bottom, and some comrades would say it was drawing frames and setting tunes. How should we deal with these erroneous thoughts? Is it to criticize and persuade, or to indulge and let them go? This is a test of whether we uphold the public or the private. If we uphold principles and criticize, some comrades may temporarily be dissatisfied with us. However, if we let them go, we will not be able to implement democratic centralism, which will bring losses to the revolution. We acted according to Chairman Mao's teachings, let everyone speak, welcomed those who spoke correctly, and let those who spoke incorrectly finish their words. We implemented the opinions of the masses that were in line with Mao Zedong Thought and resolutely resisted those that were incorrect. We relied on the masses to criticize the anarchist trend, making these erroneous thoughts have no market and not allowing them to spread freely.

Fourth, overthrowing the private and establishing the public is the key to daring to work boldly and take on heavy responsibilities.

After seizing power, our responsibilities became heavier, and our duties became greater. When hearing some criticisms, sometimes our thoughts were shaken, and we did not want to do leadership work, feeling that it was better to be an ordinary worker. At this moment, proletarian revolutionary comrades sincerely criticized and helped us, saying, "This is not a personal issue, but a question of whether the proletariat wants to seize power." "Difficult work is like a burden placed before us, seeing if we dare to bear it. Burdens are light and heavy. Some people pick the light ones and push the heavy ones to others, which is not a good attitude. Some comrades are not like this; they let others enjoy first and take the heavy burdens, suffer first and enjoy later. Such comrades are good comrades. We should all learn from this communist spirit." Chairman Mao's teachings and the help of revolutionary masses made us further realize that we are servants of the people and must not betray the trust of the party and comrades. We must truly serve the people "completely" and "thoroughly." Once, someone said that one of our comrades wanted to be a leader, and this comrade did not have any fluctuations in thought or affect work due to others' misunderstandings. We felt that we must constantly struggle against the "private" in our minds to truly dedicate ourselves to the public, bravely shoulder the heavy responsibilities entrusted by comrades, and contribute everything to the revolutionary cause.

Fifth, overthrowing the private and establishing the public is the key to placing ourselves under the supervision of the masses and constantly transforming ourselves.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In class society, everyone lives in a certain class position, and all thoughts are imprinted with class characteristics."

After seizing power, our status changed. If we do not pay attention to ideological transformation, then bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts can easily grow. At the same time, because of victory, we will encounter the gratitude of the people and also the flattery of the bourgeoisie. In this situation, we must more humbly listen to the criticisms and opinions of the masses and more consciously transform our thoughts. If we can only hear praise and cannot listen to the criticisms of the masses, it is very easy to be hit by the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie. Generally speaking, praise is easier to hear, and some relatively sharp criticisms are uncomfortable to hear. However, we think: If we do not seriously listen to the criticisms of the masses, we will not be able to wield power properly, and may gradually degenerate and turn into our opposite; the opinions of the vast majority of the masses are based on concern and care for us, for the purpose of doing a good job in the Cultural Revolution and revolutionary work; their criticisms, although sometimes very sharp, are often very helpful for us to improve our work style. Once we think of these, we can treat the criticisms of the masses with a relatively calm attitude and humbly take in the opinions. For a small number of incorrect opinions, we believe that the person who raised the opinion will educate themselves and correct it, and we must not retaliate. Under this ideological guidance, we generally can listen to different opinions and have also established a monthly democratic life system, organizing revolutionary comrades to raise opinions to the leadership core.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The transformation of worldviews is a fundamental transformation." Overthrowing the private and establishing the public is to overthrow the bourgeois worldview and establish the proletarian worldview. This struggle to overthrow the private and establish the public is long-term and arduous. In the future, we will better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, take the "Three Articles" as our motto, further transform ourselves, promote ideological revolutionization, and hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We will closely link the great criticism of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of our unit, and carry the Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

    破私立公，才能掌好权用好权
    《新贵州报》革命委员会
    在伟大的无产阶级文化大革命中，我社无产阶级革命派，从旧《贵州日报》内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺回了党、政、财、文大权，重新占领了这个宣传阵地，建立了《新贵州报》革命委员会。
    我们受到广大革命群众的信任，被选为革命委员会的成员，地位发生了变化。如何做好领导工作，对我们来说是一个考验。几个月来的实践，使我们深深体会到，最根本的就是加倍努力地活学活用毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，狠夺自己头脑里私字的权，破私立公。只有这样，才能掌好权用好权。
    第一，破私立公，才能坚决按毛主席的指示办事，坚定不移地贯彻执行党的政策。
    今年一月间，毛主席和党中央批准了贵州省无产阶级革命派的夺权，这是对我们最大的支持，最大的鼓舞。在这大好形势下，我们从政治上、组织上很快地分化瓦解了报社的保守组织。这时，如何正确对待受蒙蔽参加保守组织的群众的问题就突出了。对受蒙蔽的群众是不是也要围斗呢？我们及时总结了运动中的经验教训，认为对受蒙蔽的群众进行围斗，是不符合毛主席的教导和党的政策的。毛主席教导我们，对犯错误的干部和群众要采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”的方针。毛主席又教导我们：无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。无产阶级革命派的同志按照毛主席的教导，经过讨论，发表了一个声明，提出要严格按党的政策办事，团结大多数。我们夺权以后，有的曾经受到资产阶级反动路线迫害的同志，不能很好地争取、教育和团结受蒙蔽的群众，这是私字的表现。应该看到，报社内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，挑动群众斗群众，欺骗和利用保守组织镇压革命群众，造成了群众之间的严重对立。受蒙蔽的群众也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，我们应该帮助他们提高觉悟，扭转方向。如果感情用事，就不可能达到团结大多数，彻底孤立党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的目的。
    我们无产阶级革命派对于受蒙蔽的群众，采取“团结——批评——团结”的方法，对他们进行深入细致的政治思想工作，如个别谈心、开座谈会等等。我们认为，这样做并不是搞折衷、和稀泥。如果我们从私字出发，不敢坚持贯彻执行党的政策，那就错了。我们严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾，正确处理人民内部矛盾，经过耐心帮助，一些受蒙蔽的群众认识到自己的错误，回到了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来，先后参加了革命群众组织。
    第二，破私立公，才能相信群众，依靠群众，放手发动群众。
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席亲自批发的贵阳棉纺厂自下而上按行政部门实现大联合的经验发表后，我们受到了极大的鼓舞，许多同志表示要走贵阳棉纺厂的道路。我们认为，《新贵州报》的无产阶级革命派已经占了优势，按行政部门实现大联合的条件基本成熟。当时，报社已经有了较大的、在群众中较有影响的革命群众组织。能不能实现无产阶级革命派按行政部门大联合，这个组织起着很重要的作用。贵阳棉纺厂的经验在报上发表的当天，这个组织经过讨论，大家一致表示，坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，同其他革命群众组织按行政部门实现大联合。他们提出按行政部门实现大联合的倡议，得到了一些兄弟队的支持和响应。报社印刷厂的几个革命群众组织，行动更快，在倡议提出的同时，他们已经实行了大联合。这对整个报社按行政部门实现大联合，对革命知识分子同工人群众大联合，起了推动作用。
    但是，无产阶级革命派内部有的同志，对这个组织提出的倡议不理解，提出了一些阻碍迅速实现大联合的意见。这个组织所提出的倡议，是破私立公的表现。如果从私字出发，论山头，他们的“山头”最大；论牌子，这块“牌子”也是响当当的。这样做是为了更好地联合起来，组成浩浩荡荡的革命大军，向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火。我们相信，群众是一定能用毛泽东思想来辨别是非的，只要做得对，群众是一定会支持的。于是，在无产阶级革命派内部开展了一场大辩论。通过辩论，广大无产阶级革命派战士更加认清了按行政部门实现大联合的好处，纷纷串连，几天之内就实现了自下而上的按行政部门的大联合。
    第三，破私立公，才能坚持原则，同各种错误思想作斗争。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们主张积极的思想斗争，因为它是达到党内和革命团体内的团结使之利于战斗的武器。每个共产党员和革命分子，应该拿起这个武器。”
    在夺权后，广大无产阶级革命派活学活用毛主席著作，自觉地遵守无产阶级的革命纪律，认真执行革命委员会的决议。同时，也积极地提出了许多批评和建议，对帮助和监督我们破私立公，改进工作作风起了很大的作用。但是，人民内部矛盾突出了，一些非无产阶级思想，如无政府主义、极端民主化等思潮，在无产阶级革命派内部反映了出来。这些错误思想起着涣散革命斗志、腐蚀革命组织的作用。有的同志听不得批评，别人提了一点不同意见，他就说这是压制民主。有时工作和斗争任务需要自上而下地提出一些要求和意见，有同志就说这是划框框，定调调。对这样一些错误思想，是进行批评说服，还是迁就，放任自流？这是考验我们是公字当头还是私字当头的原则问题。如果坚持原则，予以批评，有的同志可能暂时会对我们不满意。但是任其自流，就不可能实行民主集中制，就会给革命带来损失。我们按照毛主席的教导，让大家讲话，别人说得对的，我们应该欢迎；别人说得不对，也应该让人把话说完。群众提的意见，符合毛泽东思想的，就坚决照办；而对于那些错误的意见，就要坚决抵制。我们依靠群众，对无政府主义思潮进行了批评，使这些错误思想没有市场，不让其自由泛滥。
    第四，破私立公，才敢于大胆工作，敢于挑重担子。
    夺权以后，我们肩上的担子更重了，责任更大了。当听到一些批评以后，有时在我们的思想上引起了一些波动，不想干领导工作，觉得还不如去当一个普通工作人员好。就在这个时候，无产阶级革命派的同志们，对我们进行诚恳的批评帮助，说“这不是个人的问题，这是无产阶级要不要掌权的问题”。“艰苦的工作就象担子，摆在我们的面前，看我们敢不敢承担。担子有轻有重。有的人拈轻怕重，把重担子推给人家，自己拣轻的挑。这就不是好的态度。有的同志不是这样，享受让给人家，担子拣重的挑，吃苦在别人前头，享受在别人后头。这样的同志就是好同志。这种共产主义者的精神，我们都要学习。”毛主席的教导，革命群众的帮助，使我们进一步认识到，我们是人民的勤务员，决不能辜负党和同志们的信任，要真正做到“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务。一次，有人说我们一个同志想当领导，我们这个同志并没有因为人家误会自己而引起思想波动，影响工作。我们感到，必须经常同自己头脑中的私字作斗争，才能一心为公，勇敢地担负起同志们委托给自己的重担，为革命事业贡献一切。
    第五，破私立公，才能把自己置于群众监督下，不断地改造自己。
    毛主席教导我们：“在阶级社会中，每一个人都在一定的阶级地位中生活，各种思想无不打上阶级的烙印。”
    夺权后，我们的地位发生了变化，如果不重视思想改造，那么，资产阶级和小资产阶级思想很容易滋长起来。同时，因为胜利，我们会遇到人民的感谢，也会遇到资产阶级的捧场。在这种情况下，我们必须更加虚心地听取群众的批评和意见，更加自觉地改造思想。如果只能听一片赞扬，而不能听取群众的批评，就很容易被资产阶级的糖衣炮弹所打中。一般说来，赞扬的话是比较容易入耳的，一些比较尖锐的批评，听起来是不舒服的。但是，我们想到：如果不认真听取来自群众的批评，就不能掌好权用好权，甚至会逐步蜕化变质，走向自己的反面；绝大多数群众的意见是从关心和爱护我们出发的，是为了搞好文化大革命，搞好革命工作；他们的批评，有时虽然很尖锐，但对我们改进工作作风往往很有好处。一想到这些，我们就能够以比较冷静的态度来对待群众的批评，虚心地把意见听进去。对极少数的错误意见，要相信提意见的人会自己教育自己，会改正过来的，决不能以牙还牙，以眼还眼。在这种思想指导下，我们一般地能够作到听取不同意见，并且还建立了一月一次的民主生活制度，组织革命同志向领导核心提意见。
    毛主席教导我们：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。破私立公，就是破资产阶级世界观，立无产阶级世界观。这种破私立公的斗争是长期的、艰巨的。今后，我们要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，把“老三篇”当作座右铭来学，进一步改造自己，促进思想革命化，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，同本单位的斗批改紧密结合起来，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
