The South Vietnamese guerrilla forces have highly demonstrated the brave spirit and wisdom of the people. In May and early June, they used light weapons to shoot down many enemy aircraft, blew up many military vehicles with landmines, and annihilated a large number of enemy troops.

In the first nine days of June, the guerrilla forces in the Bo Ai area of Ninh Thuan Province consecutively shot down and severely damaged 14 American aggressor aircraft with light weapons, including 6 jet fighters, 4 transport planes, and 4 helicopters.

From May 4 to 6, the guerrilla forces in the districts of Thanh Ha, Loc Ha, and Lien Hieu in Soc Trang Province shot down and damaged 6 American aircraft (including 1 jet fighter).

On May 25, the guerrilla forces in Kien Giang Province shot down 2 helicopters and damaged 5 others, killing 14 enemy troops.

In May, the guerrilla forces and local forces in Quang Ngai Province used unexploded bombs and shells made into landmines to destroy 14 enemy armored vehicles and 17 other military vehicles, killing 438 enemy troops (including over 100 American invaders and 90 South Korean mercenaries), blowing up 10 bridges, and damaging some sections of National Highway 1.

On May 24, the guerrilla forces in My Tho Province set off landmines to attack the forward command post and ammunition depot of the American invaders in the village of Qua in the district of Tuong Binh, destroying and damaging 3 military vehicles and killing 20 American invaders. On the same day, the guerrilla forces in the district of Chau Thanh in Ba Ria Province also blew up an armored vehicle guarding the Ba Ria airfield, annihilating all the enemy troops on the vehicle.

On the night of June 16, the guerrilla forces in the district of Kinh Te in the county of Sau Lop in Sa Dec Province ambushed the enemy with landmines about one kilometer away from the New Dinh airfield, destroying a jeep and killing four American and puppet military officers on the vehicle.

According to a supplementary report from the Vietnam South Liberation News Agency, on the night of May 9 to the early morning of May 10, the liberation armed forces in the province of Phu Yen attacked the enemy's oil depot in the city of Qui Nhon. They destroyed 7 oil tanks, burned 10 million liters of oil, and killed and wounded 360 American invaders. The burning oil caused a fire that lasted for three days and three nights, spreading to some streets in the city of Qui Nhon and nearby ammunition depots and airfields.

The liberation armed forces also entered the city of Qui Nhon, distributing leaflets reporting the victory of the South Liberation Armed Forces, which caused great panic among the enemy. The people of Qui Nhon were overjoyed and enthusiastically cheered the great victory of the liberation armed forces after seeing the news of victory.

On their way back from the battle, the liberation armed forces also attacked the "pacification" personnel in the countryside, eliminating five bandits for the local people.
