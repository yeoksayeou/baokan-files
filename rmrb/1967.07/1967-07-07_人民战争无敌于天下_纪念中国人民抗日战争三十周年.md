Thirty years ago today, Japanese imperialism manufactured the "Lugou Bridge Incident," launching a full-scale invasion of China. From then on, under the leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and our great leader Chairman Mao, the Chinese people began an eight-year-long, unprecedentedly large-scale national revolutionary war in the history of world revolution.

The Chinese people's war of resistance against Japan was a great people's war personally commanded and led by our great helmsman Chairman Mao, with the participation of tens of millions of people. As Chairman Mao pointed out: "This is a marvel in the history of war, a great feat of the Chinese nation, and a magnificent achievement that shook heaven and earth."

At that time, the Kuomintang ruling clique pursued a policy of capitulation and surrender, adopting a policy of "non-resistance" towards Japanese imperialism's aggression for a long period, allowing the Japanese invaders to easily occupy our country's Northeast and North China. After Japanese imperialism launched a full-scale war of aggression, Chiang Kai-shek's Kuomintang army collapsed at the first encounter, suffered a crushing defeat, and later retreated to Mount Emei, pursuing a reactionary policy of passive resistance and active anti-communism.

At this critical moment of life and death for the Chinese nation, it was the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao who mobilized tens of millions of people, organizing a vast anti-Japanese army. The Eighth Route Army and the New Fourth Army led by the Chinese Communist Party rushed to the front lines, advanced into enemy territory, shouldered the heavy responsibility of the war of resistance against Japan, opened up vast anti-Japanese democratic base areas, and fought a protracted and arduous struggle. After eight years of fighting, they achieved a great victory in the war of resistance against Japan.

The Chinese people's war of resistance against Japan was an important part of the world's anti-fascist war. The Chinese people's persistence in the war of resistance and their brave fighting played a great role in winning the victory of the world's anti-fascist war.

Through this national revolutionary war, the revolutionary forces of the Chinese people became a hundred times stronger. This laid the foundation for the later victory of the Chinese people's liberation war.

During the war of resistance against Japan, Chairman Mao brilliantly solved a series of problems of people's war in theory and practice, solved a series of problems of the proletarian-led national democratic revolution, and creatively enriched and developed Marxism-Leninism to a great extent, making an immeasurable contribution to the contemporary world proletarian revolutionary cause.

The victory of the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japan is the victory of Chairman Mao's theory of people's war, the victory of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

Chairman Mao's correct political and military lines were the fundamental guarantee for the victory of the war of resistance against Japan. During the war of resistance against Japan, Chairman Mao formulated the strategic policy of protracted war, established a complete set of strategies and tactics for people's war, and proposed the line of mobilizing the masses, strengthening the people's forces, and, under the leadership of our party, defeating the aggressors and building a new China, which is a Marxist-Leninist revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "Revolutionary war is the war of the masses; only by mobilizing the masses can war be waged, only by relying on the masses can war be waged." "The deepest source of the great power of war lies among the people." During the war of resistance against Japan, our party followed Chairman Mao's teachings, mobilized the masses, organized the masses, propagandized the masses, armed the masses, and to the greatest extent possible, aroused the revolutionary enthusiasm of the people. In the face of the enemy's strength and our weakness, we persisted in the struggle, gradually changed the balance of power between the enemy and us, and finally won the victory of the war of resistance.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "The essence of the Chinese revolution is the peasant revolution," and "the war of resistance against Japan is essentially a peasant war." The Chinese revolution must follow the path of relying on the peasants, establishing rural base areas, surrounding the cities with the countryside, and finally seizing the cities. During the war of resistance against Japan, our party followed this victorious path indicated by Chairman Mao, adopted a series of correct policies, fully mobilized the great strength of the peasant masses, and, with the vast rural base areas as a foothold, continuously annihilated the enemy's effective combat forces, creating a brilliant example of surrounding the cities with the countryside.

Chairman Mao pointed out: "For the Chinese revolution to be victorious, it is impossible without a united front that includes the absolute majority of the population of the entire nation. Not only that, but this united front must also be under the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party. Without the strong leadership of the Chinese Communist Party, any revolutionary united front cannot be victorious." During the war of resistance against Japan, our party, following Chairman Mao's line and policies, united all forces that could be united, consolidated and expanded the anti-Japanese national united front. In this united front, our party insisted on the principle of independence and autonomy, insisted on the leadership of the proletariat. This issue of the leadership responsibility of the Chinese revolution is the key to the success or failure of the revolution.

Chairman Mao's revolutionary line opened up the road to victory for the war of resistance against Japan and the Chinese revolution through struggles against right opportunism and "left" opportunism.

After establishing the anti-Japanese national united front, Wang Ming, who had previously represented the "left" opportunist line, became a representative of right opportunism, that is, capitulationism. He proposed a thoroughly capitulationist line to oppose Chairman Mao's correct line. He abandoned the leadership of the proletariat over the national revolutionary war, opposed mobilizing the masses, did not want base areas, did not want people's armed forces, and wanted to hand over everything of the people to the representatives of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, Chiang Kai-shek. This class capitulationism was essentially national capitulationism. If this right opportunist line had been followed, there would have been no people's war, no victory of the people's war, and certainly no national liberation.

Under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, our party resolutely fought against this right opportunist line, timely overcame this error, and thus ensured the victory of the war of resistance against Japan.

After the victory of the war of resistance against Japan, the biggest capitalist-roaders within the party did not dare to wage a people's war and openly advocated the parliamentary road, wanting our party to hand over the army to the Kuomintang and go to the Kuomintang reactionary government to be "officials." According to his plan, it would mean that the Chinese people would hand over the fruits of victory won through eight years of arduous resistance to the Kuomintang reactionaries. This was pure class capitulationism.

Chairman Mao timely criticized this right opportunist line, further developed the thought of people's war, and led the Chinese people to wage an even larger-scale people's war. In just over three years, the Kuomintang reactionary regime was overthrown and New China was established.

As Comrade Lin Biao pointed out in his article "Long Live the Victory of People's War": "Comrade Mao Zedong's theory of people's war, after being tested by the long-term practice of the Chinese revolution, has proven to be in accordance with the objective laws of people's war and is invincible. It is not only applicable to China but also a great contribution to the revolutionary struggles of the oppressed nations and peoples of the world."

Today, Chairman Mao's theory of people's war is being widely spread throughout the world. The power of people's war is becoming increasingly great. History has proven and will continue to prove that people's war is the most effective weapon against American imperialism and its lackeys. Oppressed nations want to achieve thorough liberation, and the peoples of all countries want to achieve thorough victory in anti-aggression wars; they can only rely on the strategies and tactics of people's war. Any other strategies and tactics are not feasible. Now, the peoples of many countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America have taken up arms to fight against American imperialism and its lackeys. Especially, the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression has set another brilliant example of relying on people's war to defeat the aggressors and achieve great victory. The oppressed nations and peoples of the world will increasingly take up the path of armed struggle, from having no weapons to taking up weapons, from not knowing how to fight to learning how to fight, from being unskilled in people's war to being skilled in people's war. This is the law of people's revolution, the law of historical development.

Faced with the current revolutionary storm of the world's peoples, imperialism led by the United States and its lackeys are in a state of extreme panic. In order to make a desperate struggle, they frantically pursue policies of aggression and war, and use various deceptive means to try to suppress the revolutions of the peoples of all countries and extinguish the flames of armed struggle. The Soviet revisionist clique, in accordance with the needs of American imperialism, frantically spreads various fallacies against people's war. The Khrushchev clique shouts that wars should stop everywhere in the world, that war should become a thing of the past, which means that oppressed nations and peoples should meekly endure the slavery and oppression of imperialism. In Vietnam, in the Middle East, and in other parts of the world, the Soviet revisionist clique colludes with American imperialism and acts as an international gendarme.

Recently, the United States, the Soviet revisionists, and the reactionaries of various countries have staged one anti-China farce after another. They frantically attack the great Chinese people and the great Mao Zedong Thought, which precisely reflects their fear of the widespread spread of the great Mao Zedong Thought among the peoples of the world, their fear of people's revolution, their fear of the oppressed nations and peoples taking up arms, and their fear of people's war. Their anti-China clamor does not harm a single hair of the great Chinese people; it is just a few flies banging into walls, buzzing, a few wails, and a few sobs.

On the thirtieth anniversary of the Chinese people's war of resistance against Japan, we must also pay attention to the fact that Japanese militarism, which launched the war of aggression against China and brought great disasters to the Chinese people, is being revived under the patronage of American imperialism. The Soviet revisionist clique openly colludes with American imperialism and Japanese militarism to build an anti-China encirclement. A small handful of Japanese Communist revisionists who have betrayed the Japanese people also participate in the anti-China chorus of the United States, the Soviet revisionists, and the reactionaries of various countries. However, the Japanese people have become more aware than ever. The situation in Asia and the world has undergone fundamental changes. The strength of the Chinese people is more powerful than ever. All the conspiracies of American imperialism and its accomplice the Soviet revisionist clique to use Japanese militarism to harm the Chinese people will surely be completely foiled.

Our great leader Chairman Mao pointed out: "The experience of class struggle in the era of imperialism tells us: the working class and the laboring masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords with the force of the gun; in this sense, we can say that the whole world can only be transformed with the gun."

People's war is a powerful weapon for transforming the world. As long as the revolutionary peoples of the world grasp Chairman Mao's great theoretical weapon of people's war, they will be invincible and will surely be able to annihilate all the demons and ghosts of imperialism, modern revisionism, and the reactionaries of various countries!

　　人民战争无敌于天下
　　——纪念中国人民抗日战争三十周年
    三十年前的今天，日本帝国主义制造了“芦沟桥事变”，发动了全面进攻中国的侵略战争。从此，中国人民在中国共产党和我们伟大领袖毛主席的领导下，开始了为期八年的在世界革命史上空前规模的民族革命战争。
    中国人民的抗日战争，是我们伟大统帅毛主席亲自指挥和领导的、有千百万群众参加的一场伟大的人民战争。正如毛主席所指出：“这是战争史上的奇观，中华民族的壮举，惊天动地的伟业。”
    当时，国民党统治集团实行卖国投降政策，对于日本帝国主义的侵略在长时期中采取“不抵抗主义”，听任日寇轻而易举地侵占了我国东北和华北的大好河山。在日本帝国主义发动全面的侵略战争之后，蒋介石的国民党军队一触即溃，一败涂地，后来又逃到峨眉山上，实行消极抗战、积极反共的反动政策。
    在这中华民族生死存亡的紧要关头，是中国共产党和毛主席，动员了千千万万的人民群众，组织了浩浩荡荡的抗日大军。中国共产党领导的八路军和新四军，奔赴前线，挺进敌后，肩负了抗日战争的重担，开辟了广大的抗日民主根据地，进行了艰苦卓绝的战斗，经过八年奋战，取得了抗日战争的伟大胜利。
    中国人民的抗日战争，是世界反法西斯战争的一个重要组成部分。中国人民坚持抗战，英勇战斗，对于争取世界反法西斯战争的胜利，起了伟大的作用。
    经过这一场民族革命战争的锻炼，中国人民的革命力量百倍地强大了。这就为后来中国人民解放战争的胜利，奠定了基础。
    在抗日战争时期，毛主席天才地从理论上和实践上解决了人民战争的一系列问题，解决了无产阶级领导的民族民主革命的一系列问题，创造性地极大地丰富和发展了马克思列宁主义，对当代世界无产阶级革命事业作出了不可估量的贡献。
    中国人民抗日战争的胜利，是毛主席的人民战争理论的胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。
    毛主席的正确的政治路线和军事路线，是抗日战争取得胜利的根本保证。在抗日战争时期，毛主席制定了持久战的战略方针，规定了一整套人民战争的战略战术，提出了放手发动群众，壮大人民的力量，在我们党领导之下，打败侵略者，建设新中国，这样一条马克思列宁主义的革命路线。
    毛主席指出：“革命战争是群众的战争，只有动员群众才能进行战争，只有依靠群众才能进行战争。”“战争的伟力之最深厚的根源，存在于民众之中。”在抗日战争时期，我们党就是按照毛主席的教导，动员群众，组织群众，宣传群众，武装群众，最大限度地调动了人民群众的革命积极性，在敌强我弱的形势下，坚持斗争，逐步改变敌我力量的对比，最后取得了抗战的胜利。
    毛主席指出：“中国的革命实质上是农民革命”，“抗日战争，实质上就是农民战争。”中国革命必须走依靠农民，建立农村根据地，以农村包围城市，最后夺取城市的道路。在抗日战争时期，我们党就是按照毛主席所指引的这条胜利道路，采取了一系列正确的政策，最充分地发挥了农民群众的伟大力量，并且以广大的农村根据地为依托，不断地歼灭敌人的有生力量，创造了农村包围城市的光辉范例。
    毛主席指出：中国革命要胜利，“没有一个包括全民族绝大多数人口的最广泛的统一战线，是不可能的。不但如此，这个统一战线还必须是在中国共产党的坚强的领导之下。没有中国共产党的坚强的领导，任何革命统一战线也是不能胜利的。”在抗日战争时期，我们党就是按照毛主席的路线和政策，团结一切可以团结的力量，巩固和扩大了抗日民族统一战线。而在这个统一战线中，我们党坚持了独立自主的原则，坚持了无产阶级的领导权。这个中国革命领导责任的问题，乃是革命成败的关键。
    毛主席的革命路线，是在同右倾机会主义和“左”倾机会主义的斗争中，为抗日战争和中国革命开辟了胜利的道路。
    在建立起抗日民族统一战线以后，曾经作为“左”倾机会主义路线代表的王明，这时变成了右倾机会主义，即投降主义的代表。他提出了一条彻头彻尾的投降主义路线，来对抗毛主席的正确路线。他放弃无产阶级对民族革命战争的领导权，反对放手发动群众，不要根据地，不要人民武装，要把人民的一切都交给大地主大资产阶级的代表蒋介石。这种阶级投降主义，实质上也就是民族投降主义。如果按照这条右倾机会主义的路线办事，那就不可能有人民战争，不可能有人民战争的胜利，更不可能有全国的解放。
    在毛主席的英明领导下，我们党同这条右倾机会主义路线进行了坚决的斗争，及时地克服了这种错误，从而保证了抗日战争的胜利。
　　抗日战争胜利以后，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，不敢进行人民战争，公开鼓吹议会道路，要我们党把军队交给国民党，到国民党反动政府里去做“官”。按照他的这一套，也就是要全国人民把八年艰苦抗战所取得的胜利果实，双手捧给国民党反动派。这是十足的阶级投降主义。
    毛主席又及时地批判了这条右倾机会主义路线，进一步发展了人民战争的思想，领导中国人民进行了更大规模的人民战争，仅仅经过三年多的时间，就推翻了国民党反动王朝，建立了新中国。
    正如林彪同志在《人民战争胜利万岁》一文中所指出：“毛泽东同志关于人民战争的理论，经过中国革命的长期实践的检验，证明是符合人民战争的客观规律的，是无往而不胜的。它不仅适用于中国，而且是对世界各被压迫民族和被压迫人民革命斗争的伟大贡献。”
    今天，毛主席关于人民战争的理论，在全世界得到空前广泛的传播。人民战争显示了越来越巨大的威力。历史已经证明并将继续证明，人民战争是对付美帝国主义及其走狗的最有效的法宝。被压迫民族要取得彻底解放，世界各国人民要在反侵略战争中取得彻底胜利，只能靠人民战争的战略战术，任何其他的战略战术都是不行的。现在，亚非拉许多国家的人民已经拿起枪杆子，同美帝国主义及其走狗进行战斗。特别是越南人民的抗美救国战争，树立了依靠人民战争打击侵略者，取得伟大胜利的又一个光辉的榜样。世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民必将越来越多地走上武装斗争的道路，从没有武器到拿起武器，从不会打仗到学会打仗，从不善于进行人民战争到善于进行人民战争。这是人民革命的规律，历史发展的规律。
    在当前世界人民的革命风暴面前，以美国为首的帝国主义及其走狗恐慌万状。他们为了进行垂死挣扎，疯狂地推行侵略政策和战争政策，并玩弄各种欺骗手段，企图镇压世界各国人民的革命，扑灭各国人民武装斗争的烈火。苏修集团适应美帝国主义的需要，拚命散布反对人民战争的种种谬论。柯西金之流叫喊什么世界各地都要“停止战争”，“战争应该在全世界成为一件过去的事情”，也就是要被压迫民族和被压迫人民乖乖地忍受帝国主义的奴役和压迫。在越南，在中东，在世界上的其他地方，苏修集团都同美帝国主义串通一气，充当国际宪兵。
    近来，美帝、苏修和各国反动派演出了一幕又一幕的反华丑剧。他们疯狂地攻击伟大的中国人民，攻击伟大的毛泽东思想，恰恰反映了他们害怕伟大的毛泽东思想在世界人民中的广泛传播，害怕人民革命，害怕被压迫民族和被压迫人民拿起武器，害怕人民战争。它们的反华喧嚣，损伤不了伟大的中国人民的一根毫毛，只不过是几个苍蝇碰壁，嗡嗡叫，几声凄厉，几声抽泣而已。
    在中国人民抗日战争三十周年的今天，我们还不能不注意到，当年发动侵华战争，给中国人民带来巨大灾难的日本军国主义，正在美帝国主义扶植下复活起来。而苏修集团公然伙同美帝国主义，与日本军国主义加紧勾结，一道构筑反华包围圈。一小撮背叛了日本人民的日共修正主义分子，也参加了美帝、苏修和各国反动派的反华大合唱。但是，日本人民已经空前觉醒。亚洲和世界形势已经发生根本变化。中国人民的力量更是无比地强大了。美帝国主义及其帮凶苏修集团，利用日本军国主义危害中国人民的一切阴谋，必将彻底破产。
    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“帝国主义时代的阶级斗争的经验告诉我们：工人阶级和劳动群众，只有用枪杆子的力量才能战胜武装的资产阶级和地主；在这个意义上，我们可以说，整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”
    人民战争就是改造世界的一个强大武器。全世界革命人民只要掌握毛主席的人民战争的伟大理论武器，就能够无敌于天下，就一定可以把帝国主义、现代修正主义、各国反动派这一切妖魔鬼怪，通通消灭！
