Under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, they resolutely return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line

The "Million Heroes Army" in Beijing, deceived masses, strike back

These deceived masses have awakened. They read Chairman Mao's books, look at Chairman Mao's portrait, and think about how they were deceived by the class enemy and did things against Mao Zedong Thought. They cannot help but shed tears of regret. They are determined to return to Wuhan, join the revolutionary forces in Wuhan, and resolutely overthrow the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes Army" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. They vow to thoroughly expose and criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party and the military in Wuhan who are taking the capitalist road, along with their backer—China's Khrushchev.

New China News Agency, July 27th

In the midst of the nation's joyous celebration of Comrades Xia Ruifeng and Wang Li's victorious and glorious return to Chairman Mao's side, the deceived masses from the "Million Heroes Army" in Wuhan, who are currently in Beijing, are turning their weapons around and striking back. They resolutely declare that they will return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and, together with the proletarian revolutionary forces in Wuhan, resolutely overthrow the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes Army" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. They vow to thoroughly expose and criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party and the military in Wuhan who are taking the capitalist road, along with their backer—China's Khrushchev.

These masses from the "Million Heroes Army" were, under the manipulation of the handful of power-holders within the Party and the military in Wuhan who are taking the capitalist road, and the deception of the handful of bad leaders within their organization who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, recently sent to Beijing. After arriving in Beijing, they were influenced by the excellent revolutionary situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital and more directly felt the great power and brilliant light of Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Many people have already noticed the problems with the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes Army" and have begun to doubt. When they heard the news of Comrades Xia Ruifeng and Wang Li's victorious and glorious return to Chairman Mao's side, they were greatly shocked. With the enthusiastic help of the proletarian revolutionary forces from the capital and Wuhan who are in Beijing, through studying Chairman Mao's works and important news and editorials from the "Red Flag" magazine, "People's Daily," and "Liberation Army Daily," they finally awakened and realized that they had been tricked by the class enemy.

These deceived masses read Chairman Mao's books, look at Chairman Mao's portrait, and think about how they were deceived by the class enemy and did things against Mao Zedong Thought. They cannot help but shed tears of regret. They feel that they have let down Chairman Mao, the Party Central Committee, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and the broad proletarian revolutionary forces. They issued statements of rebellion and resolutely withdrew from the "Million Heroes Army." Seven people wrote in a joint statement: "We resolutely draw a clear line with the handful of power-holders within the Party and the military in Wuhan who are taking the capitalist road and the handful of bad leaders in the 'Million Heroes Army.' We resolutely rebel against them and stand firmly on the side of the proletarian revolutionary forces. To defend Chairman Mao, to defend the Party Central Committee, to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, we vow to fight them resolutely, to expose the handful of bad leaders and the hidden manipulators in the 'Million Heroes Army,' and we will not rest until we achieve complete victory!"

Many people also quickly wrote materials to expose and criticize the heinous crimes of the handful of power-holders within the Party and the military in Wuhan who are taking the capitalist road and the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes Army." Many people wrote letters to the deceived masses in the "Million Heroes Army," urging them to rebel. One person wrote: "At this critical moment, where should we go? We should make a decisive move, turn our weapons around, and quickly return to the side of the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. I suggest that you immediately take revolutionary action, kick out the 'Million Heroes Army,' rebel, actively expose and criticize the heinous crimes of the handful of bad people in the 'Million Heroes Army' and the handful of power-holders within the Party and the military in Wuhan who are taking the capitalist road." They are determined to return to Wuhan, learn from the proletarian revolutionary forces, get close to the proletarian revolutionary forces, and together with the proletarian revolutionary forces, forever be loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao, forever follow the course charted by the great helmsman Chairman Mao, and vow to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end. Their actions have been warmly welcomed and encouraged by the proletarian revolutionary forces from the capital and Wuhan who are in Beijing.

    在京“百万雄师”受蒙蔽群众大杀回马枪
    这些受蒙蔽的群众猛醒了，他们读着毛主席的书，看着毛主席的像，想着自己受阶级敌人蒙蔽竟然做了违背毛泽东思想的事，不禁流下了痛心的眼泪。他们决心杀回武汉，同武汉革命派一起坚决打倒“百万雄师”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头，誓把武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其后台——中国的赫鲁晓夫揭深、揭透，斗倒、斗臭。
    新华社二十七日讯　在举国欢呼谢富治、王力同志胜利地、光荣地回到毛主席身边的强烈的革命气氛中，正在北京的武汉地区“百万雄师”中受蒙蔽的群众，纷纷回戈造反，大杀回马枪。他们毅然决然地表示要回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来，与武汉地区无产阶级革命派一起，坚决打倒“百万雄师”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头，誓把武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和他们的总后台——中国的赫鲁晓夫揭深、揭透，斗倒、斗臭。
    “百万雄师”中的这些群众，是在武汉地区一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的操纵下，在他们组织中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头蒙蔽下，不久前陆续来到北京的。他们来到北京以后，受到了首都无产阶级文化大革命一派大好革命形势的熏染，更加直接地感受到毛泽东思想和毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的巨大威力和灿烂光辉。许多人对“百万雄师”中一小撮坏头头的问题已经有所觉察，开始怀疑。当他们听到谢富治、王力同志胜利地、光荣地回到毛主席身边的消息后，受到了巨大的震动。在首都和武汉地区来京的无产阶级革命派的热情帮助下，通过学习毛主席著作和《红旗》杂志、《人民日报》、《解放军报》的重要消息和社论，他们终于猛醒过来，认识到自己是上了阶级敌人的当。
    这些受蒙蔽的群众，读着毛主席的书，看着毛主席的像，想想自己在阶级敌人的蒙蔽下竟然做了违背毛泽东思想的事，不禁流下了痛心的眼泪。他们感到自己对不起毛主席，对不起党中央，对不起中央文革小组，对不起广大的无产阶级革命派，纷纷发表造反声明，毅然退出“百万雄师”。有七个人在联合声明中写道：“我们坚决与武汉一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和‘百万雄师’中一小撮坏头头划清界限，并坚决造他们的反，坚定不移地站在无产阶级革命派一边，为了保卫毛主席，为了保卫党中央，为了保卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，誓与他们作坚决的斗争，坚决揪出‘百万雄师’中一小撮坏头头和幕后操纵者，不获全胜，决不罢休！”
    许多人还赶写揭发批判材料，愤怒地控诉武汉地区一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和“百万雄师”中一小撮坏头头的反革命滔天罪行。不少人挥笔疾书，给“百万雄师”中受蒙蔽的群众写信，要他们起来造反。有的人写道：“在这个关键时刻，我们应该何去何从？应该当机立断，反戈一击，迅速地回到以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线一边来。我建议你们，立即采取革命行动，踢开‘百万雄师’，起来造反，积极揭发和控诉‘百万雄师’中的一小撮坏人和武汉地区一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行。”他们决心回到武汉去，向无产阶级革命派学习，向无产阶级革命派靠拢，和无产阶级革命派一起，永远忠于伟大领袖毛主席，永远沿着伟大统帅毛主席所指引的航向前进，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。他们的这些行动，受到了首都和武汉地区来京的无产阶级革命派的热烈欢迎和鼓励。
