Revolutionary cadres and members of Xinlian Brigade in Pingwang Commune, Wuxian County, Jiangsu Province, have been holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism guided by Mao Zedong Thought during the busy summer harvest and planting season. From homes to fields and work sites, they have been criticizing the capitalist roaders within the Party who oppose emphasizing politics and advocate "material incentives" in agricultural production. This has promoted the revolutionization of people's thinking, making the summer harvest and planting both swift and successful.

Xinlian Brigade is a model brigade for the county. Over the past few years, a handful of capitalist roaders within the county committee, following the directives of the capitalist roader within the Party, have implemented a revisionist line in the model agricultural work. They opposed emphasizing proletarian politics, advocated "production first," and strongly promoted "material incentives." They claimed that "good politics only has a shadow, good production has a label." To achieve their goal of "yielding a thousand catties per mu," they used all means necessary, regardless of cost, relying on special treatment to create model brigades. The cadres and members of the seventh production team revealed that, under the influence of the capitalist roader's fallacy that "if production is not good, everything is in vain," in 1964, when the team's own fertilizer production did not meet the requirements, the county provided "special treatment" by directly allocating 6,000 catties of chemical fertilizer. With the purchase of more commercial fertilizer, agricultural costs increased, bringing serious adverse effects to production. Through exposure and criticism, everyone realized that opposing the emphasis on politics and advocating "material incentives" harms the state, the collective, and the members themselves. Especially in contrast to Chairman Mao's teaching that "political work is the lifeline of all economic work," they recognized that the struggle is between emphasizing politics and relying on material incentives, which is a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads.

Through the criticism, everyone's hatred for the capitalist roader within the Party deepened, and their love for Chairman Mao increased. They all expressed their determination to persist in emphasizing politics and work for the revolution by farming. During the summer harvest and planting, cadres and members exhibited the spirit of self-reliance and thrift in managing the collective, exploring every possible way to increase revenue and reduce expenditures for the collective, thereby increasing wealth. The summer harvest and planting were both swift and successful.

　　坚持突出政治　批倒“物质刺激”
　　新联大队深入开展革命的大批判运动，夏收夏种又快又好
    据新华社南京电　江苏吴江县平望公社新联大队的革命干部和社员，在夏收夏种大忙期间，高举毛泽东思想的革命批判旗帜，从家庭到田头、场地，批判党内头号走资本主义道路的当权派在农业生产上反对突出政治、鼓吹“物质刺激”的反动谬论，促进了人的思想革命化，夏收夏种搞得又快又好。
    新联大队是县的中心样板队。几年来，县委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，秉承党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的旨意，在农业样板工作上贯彻了一条修正主义黑线，反对突出无产阶级政治，鼓吹“生产第一”，大力提倡“物质刺激”。胡说什么“政治好只有影子，生产好才有牌子”。为了达到他们提出的“产量争千斤”的目的，就不择手段，不计工本，靠特殊照顾来办样板。第七生产队干部社员揭发，在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派的“生产搞不好，一切都是空的”谬论支配下，一九六四年队里自积肥料达不到要求，县里就“特殊照顾”，直接分配六千斤化肥。商品肥料多买了，农业成本就大了，给生产带来了严重的恶果。通过揭发批判，大家认识到，反对突出政治，鼓吹“物质刺激”，害国家、害集体、害社员自己。特别是对照毛主席“政治工作是一切经济工作的生命线”的教导，认识到是突出政治，还是靠物质刺激，这是坚持社会主义还是复辟资本主义两条道路的斗争。
    通过大批判，大家对党内头号走资本主义道路当权派更加仇恨，对毛主席更加热爱，纷纷表示要坚持突出政治，为革命种田，以革命精神种好田。在夏收夏种中，干部和社员发扬自力更生、勤俭办社的精神，千方百计为集体开源节流，增加财富，夏收夏种搞得又快又好。
