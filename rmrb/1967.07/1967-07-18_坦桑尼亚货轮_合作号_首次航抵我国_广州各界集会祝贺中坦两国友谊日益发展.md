Tanzanian Ambassador to China, Mwaluko, and his wife, as well as embassy officials, were invited to Guangzhou to attend the welcoming rally.

At around 7 a.m., the first Tanzanian 10,000-ton cargo ship "Cooperation" slowly docked. The whistles of the ships anchored at the port blared in welcome, and the crowd waving red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" cheered enthusiastically both on shore and on the ship.

The welcoming rally began with everyone singing "The East Is Red." Su Dongshan spoke at the rally, expressing warm welcome on behalf of the people of Guangdong to the arrival of the "Cooperation" in China. Vice Minister of Communications Peng Deqing and Ambassador Mwaluko also spoke at the rally.
