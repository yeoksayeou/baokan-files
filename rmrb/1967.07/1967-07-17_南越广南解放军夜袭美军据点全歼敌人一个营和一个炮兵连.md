	South Vietnamese Liberation Army Night Raid on U.S. Military Base Annihilates an Enemy Battalion and an Artillery Company

	According to a report from the New China News Agency in Hanoi, the liberation armed forces in Quang Nam Province, South Vietnam, launched a fierce attack on the U.S. military base in Nong Son, Quy Son County, from the night of July 3 to the early morning of July 4. In just twenty minutes of combat, they captured the base and annihilated an entire U.S. Marine Corps battalion and an artillery company stationed there.

	According to preliminary reports, the liberation armed forces occupied the base until the morning of July 4, seizing and destroying all weapons, ammunition, and military supplies within the base. This included two cannons, four mortars, twenty-eight light and heavy machine guns, and twelve radio transmitters and receivers.

	In the morning of July 4, the U.S. invaders, unwilling to accept their defeat, dispatched fifty sorties of helicopters to transport reinforcements to the Nong Son area. However, they were met with fierce attacks from the liberation armed forces, suffering heavy casualties. This victory demonstrates the superiority of the Vietnamese people and military in their continuous, fierce, and widespread attacks on the enemy across various battlefields, while also showing the enemy's desperate and disorganized situation.

    南越广南解放军夜袭美军据点全歼敌人一个营和一个炮兵连
    据新华社河内电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方广南省解放武装力量，七月三日夜间到四日凌晨猛烈地进攻了桂山县农山美军据点，仅仅经过二十分钟的战斗就占领了这一据点，全歼盘踞在这个据点的美国海军陆战队一个营和一个炮兵连。
    据初步消息，解放武装力量占领这个据点到四日上午，缴获和击毁据点内的全部武器、弹药和军用物资，其中包括大炮二门、迫击炮四门、轻重机枪二十八挺、无线电收发报机十二部。
    四日上午，美国侵略军不甘心于他们的失败，又出动五十架次的直升飞机运载援军到农山地区，但是遭到解放武装力量的猛烈袭击，死伤累累。这一胜利证明了越南南方军民在各个战场上连续、猛烈和广泛地进攻敌人的优势，同时表明了敌人处于被动挨打的狼狈处境。
