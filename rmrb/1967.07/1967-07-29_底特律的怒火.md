The gunshots in Detroit awakened the head of American imperialism, Johnson, from his sleep. The news of the large-scale violent resistance by American blacks in this largest American city of the automobile industry, and the urgent telegrams from local officials in Michigan seeking help, made Johnson rush to the television studio in the middle of the night to address the nation.

With a stern face, he shouted, "We cannot tolerate lawlessness. We cannot tolerate violent actions." He announced that due to the "inability of local officials to control the situation," it was necessary to immediately dispatch two brigades of nearly five thousand federal paratroopers to Detroit to suppress the black resistance.

For several days, these federal troops, along with more than ten thousand National Guardsmen and armed police in the city, aboard planes, tanks, armored vehicles, and patrol cars, conducted a frenzied search and massacre in Detroit, turning the city of automobiles into a scene of bloodshed.

However, as Chairman Mao pointed out, "The various forms of oppression and slaughter inflicted on the revolutionary people by the reactionaries can only serve to promote a more extensive and more intense revolution." Johnson's orders and the police suppression did not quell the violent resistance of American blacks but instead made it more intense.

The flames of anger burned from house to house and street to street, turning the dens of the oppressors into ruins.

Angry bullets flew from doorways, corners, rooftops, and basements, one by one, towards the bloodthirsty executioners.

The sound of gunfire echoed through the night sky.

In just three days, this city, which the American automobile industry monopoly capitalists regarded as a treasure trove, became paralyzed.

Western reporters described the scene in Detroit as follows:

"The entire city seemed to be in a street battle," "parts of the area became no-man's-land," "from the air, it looked like a city hit by bombs," "if you add a few rice fields to these places, it would be just like South Vietnam (battlefield)."

The blazing fire in Detroit made the entire American ruling class tremble with fear. In the White House, Congress, the State Department, and the Department of Justice, the gentlemen in Washington were in a state of panic, attacking each other, and in complete disarray, not knowing what to do. Johnson was so tense that he contacted his special representative Vance, whom he had sent to Detroit to direct the suppression, every half hour.

Of course, what made the Johnson administration and the entire American ruling class tremble was not the destruction suffered by the city of Detroit, but the fact that American blacks had so quickly, so decisively, and so bravely taken to the path of armed resistance, and in this battle, they had unleashed such tremendous, volcanic-like power.

The gentlemen in Washington are now worried: if only tens of thousands of blacks with a few weapons can turn a vast automobile industry center into a "dead city" in just a few days, then what if the more than twenty million blacks wake up and take action, arm themselves, and rebel, how will they be dealt with?

A report from a correspondent of the British Financial Times in Washington said: "Black residents in American cities are now generally fed up with everything, and they will use any pretext, any grievance as an excuse to seize weapons and take to the streets." This situation, where sparks are everywhere and explosions can occur at any moment, shows that in the United States, more Detroit events will appear before Johnson. And in the Detroit resistance, the American blacks who showed great power will, with the arrival of new battles, show even greater power.

    底特律的怒火
    万山红
    底特律的枪声，把美帝国主义头子约翰逊从睡梦中惊醒了过来。从这个美国最大的汽车工业城市传来的美国黑人抗暴斗争大爆发的消息，和密执安州地方官员纷纷求援告急的电报，使约翰逊在深更半夜匆匆忙忙地赶到电视台前向全国发表广播讲话。
    他紧绷着脸叫喊道：“我们不能容忍无法无天的行为。我们不能容忍暴力行动。”他宣布，由于“当地的官员无法控制局势”，需要立即派出两个旅近五千兵力的联邦空降部队前往底特律去镇压黑人斗争。
    几天来，这批联邦部队同当地的一万多名国民警卫队和武装警察，乘着飞机、坦克、装甲车和巡逻车，在底特律进行了一场疯狂的大搜捕，大屠杀，血洗了这个汽车工业之城。
    但是，正如毛主席所指出的，反动派“对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”约翰逊的命令和军警的镇压，不但没有能够使美国黑人的抗暴斗争平息下来，反而使它更加猛烈了。
    愤怒的火焰，从一幢幢的房屋燃烧到一条条的街道，把成片压迫者的黑窝变成废墟。
    愤怒的子弹，从门洞里，墙角落，屋顶上，地下室，一颗颗地射向杀气腾腾的刽子手。
    愤怒的枪声，在整个夜空中呼啸。
    只不过三天时间，这个被美国汽车工业垄断资本集团当作聚宝盆的第五大城市就变得瘫痪了。
    西方记者这样描述了底特律的情景：
    “整个城市好象是在打一场巷战”，“部分地区成了无人地带”，从空中看来，“好象一个中了炸弹的城市”，“只要在这些地方加上几块稻田，简直就和南越（战场）一样”。
    底特律的这一场熊熊烈火，使整个美国统治集团吓得发抖。在白宫，在国会，在国务院，在司法部，华盛顿的老爷们惊慌不安，互相攻击，乱成一团，不知如何是好。约翰逊甚至紧张到每隔半小时就同他派到底特律去指挥镇压行动的特派代表万斯联系一次。
    当然，使得约翰逊政府和整个美国统治集团心惊胆战的，并不是底特律这个城市所遭到的破坏，而是美国黑人竟然这么迅速、这么坚决、这么勇猛地走上武装抗暴的战斗道路，而且在这一场战斗中迸发出这么巨大的、象火山爆发一样的力量。
    华盛顿老爷们现在不能不引以为忧的是：仅仅几万名黑人用少数武器，在短短几天之内，就能把一个偌大的汽车工业中心变成一个“死城”，那么，如果二千多万黑人都觉醒起来，行动起来，拿起武器造反，可怎么收拾？
    英国《金融时报》记者从华盛顿发出的一篇报道说：“美国城市的黑人居民现在普遍地对一切都感到厌倦，他们将利用任何借口、任何不满作为理由夺取枪支和上街活动”。这种到处布满火种，到处都会一触即发的爆炸性局势说明，在美国，在约翰逊的面前，还会有更多的底特律事件出现。而在底特律的抗暴斗争中，显示了强大力量的美国黑人，随着新的战斗的到来，必将表现出更加强大的力量。
