After our school resumed classes and launched the revolution, we first encountered some issues in our daily lives, such as not having enough desks, benches, and beds. Should we rely on ourselves or ask the state for help? We studied Chairman Mao's works with this question in mind. Chairman Mao said, "Everything should be done according to the principle of thrift." Therefore, we decided to repair the desks and benches ourselves. We set up large saws and cut the short wood left behind, assembling them into beds to solve the accommodation problem for our classmates.

Our area has been experiencing a prolonged drought, and with the increase in students, water has become insufficient. Some suggested hiring outside workers to dig wells. Revolutionary teachers and students insisted on the principle of self-reliance and decided to deepen the existing wells to increase the water output. In just two evenings, we deepened two wells by two meters each, completely solving the water problem for the school's teachers and students.

Additionally, we cut thatch and found banana leaves to build some simple shower rooms for students to use in the summer.

Through these activities, we not only solved many specific problems in our school but, more importantly, we learned Chairman Mao's instructions on thrift in all undertakings again, receiving a profound ideological education.

		Postscript

		Repairing damaged desks and chairs by ourselves, using collected bricks, tiles, and wood to build kitchens, leveling out uneven grounds... these are all manifestations of the revolutionary teachers and students cherishing the fruits of the laboring people and loving labor. They regard engaging in these activities as a major event to strengthen their class feelings with the laboring people.

		Thus, every desk and chair repaired brings them one step closer to the laboring people in their thoughts and emotions; every wall repaired moves them one step forward on the path of transforming their worldview. The revolutionary teachers and students said well: through the activities of thrift in running the school, we had a vivid political lesson.

		Now, many places across the country are experiencing the good situation of resuming classes and launching the revolution. Revolutionary teachers and students should emphasize proletarian politics, implementing the great leader Chairman Mao's teachings on thrift in all undertakings in their actual actions.

    自修校具　自己打井
    我校复课闹革命后，首先在生活上碰到一些问题，例如课桌、条凳、床铺等等都不够用。是自力更生，还是伸手向国家要？我们带着这个问题学习了毛主席著作。毛主席说：“什么事情都应当执行勤俭的原则”。于是，我们就决定自己动手修理课桌、条凳。我们架起大锯，动手锯了以前留下来的短木，把它们搭成床，解决了同学的住宿问题。
    我们这里久旱不雨，学生增多以后，饮水不足。有人主张请外面工人打井。革命师生坚持自力更生的原则，决定加深原有水井的深度，提高出水量。仅仅利用了两个晚上的时间，我们就把两口井各加深了二米，彻底解决了学校师生的用水问题。
    此外，我们还自己动手割茅草，找芭蕉叶搭了一些简易的洗澡房，供同学们夏天洗澡用。
    通过这些活动，不仅解决了我们学校的许多具体问题，更重要的是使我们再一次学习了毛主席有关勤俭办一切事业的指示，受到了深刻的思想教育。

    自己动手，把损坏了的桌椅修理好，把收集起来的砖瓦木材用来修建厨房，把坎坷的场地填平……，这些都是广大革命师生珍惜劳动人民成果、热爱劳动的表现。他们把从事这些活动，看成是自己增强劳动人民阶级感情的大事。
    这样，每修好一个桌椅，他们的思想感情就和劳动人民靠拢一步；每修好一堵墙，他们就在改造自己世界观的道路上迈进一步。革命师生们说得好：通过勤俭办校的活动，我们上了一堂生动的政治课。
    现在，全国许多地方出现复课闹革命的大好形势。广大革命师生，要突出无产阶级政治，把伟大领袖毛主席关于勤俭办一切事业的教导，贯彻到实际行动中去。
