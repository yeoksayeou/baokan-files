A storm is brewing, waves are surging. A new storm of revolutionary criticism against the party's top capitalist-roaders is sweeping across China with the force of a thunderbolt and the momentum of a tidal wave, shaking the world.

This great situation is a cause for great joy and encouragement for the Red Guards, who have been fighting tirelessly.

Over the past year, millions of previously unknown young people have followed the great leader Chairman Mao, stepping onto the stage of history with heroic spirit and vigor, becoming the brave pioneers of the proletarian cultural revolution.

The Red Guards, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, have wielded the mighty cudgel of Mao Zedong Thought and the iron broom of the proletariat, sweeping away the remnants of the old world and fighting against the evil waves of the four seas. They have struck down the capitalist-roaders within the party, leaving them in disarray.

The Red Guards, with their loyal hearts and fearless spirit, have swept away the demons and turned the tide, creating a great reversal of the bourgeois reactionary line. They have used their blood and lives to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

Together with the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers, the Red Guards have dared to challenge the emperor, daring to overthrow the throne, and have stormed the lair of the party's top capitalist-roaders. They have exposed China's Khrushchev and unearthed the time bomb buried next to Chairman Mao.

The Red Guards' heroic spirit and immortal achievements will forever be recorded in the glorious annals of the proletarian cultural revolution. We must pursue the fleeing enemy and not seek fame like the king of Chu. The victories achieved by the heroic Red Guards are but the first step of a long march. More arduous tasks lie ahead. We must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: carry the revolution through to the end!

The top capitalist-roaders within the party, along with the Peng Zhen counter-revolutionary revisionist clique, though defeated, are not yet dead. They are a pack of man-eating demons and blood-drinking wolves, traitors seeking personal gain, and ruthless killers. They are true Khrushchev-style conspirators and careerists. Their nature will never change; they will always attempt to drown the revolutionary people in a sea of blood someday.

History has provided many painful lessons. Can the revolutionary Red Guards forget the April 12 counter-revolutionary massacre by Chiang Kai-shek, the Hungarian counter-revolutionary incident, and Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary coup? No, absolutely not! At this critical moment in the decisive battle against the party's top capitalist-roaders, forgetting these lessons means betrayal!

Revolutionary criticism is a great strategic deployment by Chairman Mao, an extremely important measure to consolidate the achievements of the proletarian cultural revolution and strengthen the dictatorship of the proletariat. It is a decisive battle that relates to the future and destiny of the Chinese and world revolutions.

Revolutionary criticism is an unprecedented great feat in human history, a great sweep of the old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits of the exploiting classes over thousands of years. It is a sublime undertaking to lay the ideological foundation for communism.

The broad masses of Red Guards must display their prowess in the fiery battle of revolutionary criticism and create new momentum. To carry out revolutionary criticism, we must dare to take the lead, carry forward the spirit of proletarian revolution and rebellion, concentrate our wisdom, strength, and targets, and give a thorough beating to the "fallen dogs." We must politically, ideologically, and theoretically criticize, overthrow, and expose the party's top capitalist-roaders, making them despised by humanity.

To carry out revolutionary criticism, we must remember Chairman Mao's teachings: to be "good at thinking" and to "think more." Under the radiant light of Mao Zedong Thought, think to gain wisdom, think to develop abilities, and think to have hope. The revolutionary youth can charge forward, wielding swords and horses, galloping freely, and smashing the hell of the capitalist-roaders. They can also sit down, work diligently and solidly, and thoroughly criticize all the decayed ideologies of the exploiting classes.

To carry out revolutionary criticism, the Red Guards must learn from the workers, peasants, and soldiers. The broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers have the firmest stand and the clearest love and hate. They are the main force in this revolutionary criticism. Chairman Mao said: "Intellectuals, if they do not combine with the workers and peasants, will accomplish nothing." Only by combining with the workers and peasants and fighting side by side with them can the Red Guards write a magnificent chapter in the history of the proletarian cultural revolution.

Ultimately, to carry out revolutionary criticism, the Red Guards must arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought, using this mighty ideological weapon to observe everything, analyze everything, and transform everything. They must thoroughly criticize the old world and turn the revolutionary criticism into a living classroom for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works.

Engels, in evaluating the European Renaissance, said: "This was the greatest progressive revolution in human history, an era that needed and produced giants..." Our proletarian cultural revolution is a revolution thousands of times greater than the European Renaissance. The era we are in is incomparable to the Renaissance era, an era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner. Such a great revolution, such a great era, needs and will produce millions of proletarian "giants." The revolutionary youth, in the storms of the proletarian cultural revolution and in the great criticism and struggle against the old world, will surely become "giants" armed with the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, becoming giants who destroy the old world and build the new world.

Our great leader Chairman Mao, in his youthful years, "pointed out the mountains and rivers, and stirred up the words," conducting the most merciless and profound exposure and criticism of the old world ruled by tigers and wolves. What a broad mind, what great ambition! The revolutionary Red Guards must learn from the great leader Chairman Mao's brilliant example and be vanguards in the revolutionary criticism!

### 红卫兵小将要做革命大批判的急先锋

    红卫兵小将要做革命大批判的急先锋
    狂飙骤起，怒涛澎湃。一个对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的革命大批判的新风暴，正以雷霆万钧之力，排山倒海之势，席卷全中国，震撼全世界。
    这一派大好形势，对于一向奋战不息的红卫兵小将，该是何等的欢欣鼓舞！
    一年来，千百万本来不出名的青少年，紧紧跟着伟大统帅毛主席，横空出世，雄姿英发，“杀”上历史舞台，成为无产阶级文化大革命的叱咤风云的勇敢闯将。
    红卫兵小将们，满怀革命的豪情，奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，挥动无产阶级的铁扫帚，上扫九天残云，下斗四海恶浪，把党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派打得落花流水，人仰马翻。
    红卫兵小将们，赤胆忠心，不怕牺牲，以革命的大无畏的精神，横扫群魔，力挽狂澜，大造了资产阶级反动路线的反，用鲜血和生命保卫毛主席的革命路线。
    红卫兵小将们，同广大工农兵一起，“舍得一身剐，敢把皇帝拉下马”，直捣党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的老巢，揪出了中国的赫鲁晓夫，挖出了埋在毛主席身边的定时炸弹。
    红卫兵小将们气壮山河的英雄气概，惊天动地的不朽功勋，将永远彪炳于无产阶级文化大革命的光辉史册。宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。英雄的红卫兵小将所取得的一切胜利，只是万里长征的第一步，更加艰巨的战斗任务正摆在我们的面前。我们要牢记毛主席的教导：将革命进行到底！
    被打落水的党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，以及彭真反革命修正主义集团，人还在，心不死。他们是一群吃人的鬼蜮、喝血的豺狼，是卖国求荣、杀人不眨眼的殃国大盗，是地地道道的赫鲁晓夫式的阴谋家、野心家。他们的本性是至死不会改变的，总是妄图在将来的某一天把革命人民淹没在血泊中。
    历史上曾经有过许多沉痛的教训。革命的红卫兵小将难道能忘记蒋介石“四·一二”反革命大屠杀，忘记匈牙利反革命事件，忘记赫鲁晓夫的反革命政变吗？不能，绝对不能！在与党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派决战的关键时刻，忘记这些就意味着背叛！
    革命的大批判，是毛主席伟大的战略部署，是巩固无产阶级文化大革命成果、加强无产阶级专政的一项极其重要的措施，是关系到中国革命和世界革命前途、命运的一次大决战。
    革命的大批判，是人类历史上空前未有的伟大创举，是对几千年来剥削阶级的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯的大扫荡，是为共产主义奠定思想基础的崇高事业。
    广大红卫兵小将一定要在革命大批判的硝烟烈火中大显身手，再展英姿，“杀”出新的威风。
    要搞好革命的大批判，就必须敢字当头，发扬无产阶级革命造反精神，集中智慧，集中力量，集中目标，痛打“落水狗”，从政治上、思想上、理论上把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批倒、批垮、批臭，使他们成为不齿于人类的狗屎堆。
    要搞好革命的大批判，就必须牢记毛主席的教导：要“善于思索”，要“多思”。在光芒万丈的毛泽东思想的照耀下，多思出智慧，多思长才干，多思有希望。革命小将，既能冲得上去，横刀策马，纵横驰骋，砸烂走资本主义道路当权派的阎王殿；也能坐得下来，艰苦细致、扎扎实实地彻底批判一切剥削阶级的腐朽意识形态。
    要搞好革命的大批判，红卫兵小将就必须向工农兵学习。广大工农兵立场最坚定，爱憎最分明，他们是这场革命大批判的主力军。毛主席说：“知识分子如果不和工农民众相结合，则将一事无成。”红卫兵小将只有同工农兵结合，和工农兵并肩战斗，才能在无产阶级文化大革命史上谱写出革命大批判的壮丽篇章。
    要搞好革命的大批判，归根结底，必须用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，运用毛泽东思想这个威力无比的思想武器，观察一切，分析一切，改造一切，彻底批判旧世界，把革命大批判变成活学活用毛主席著作的大课堂。
    恩格斯在评价欧洲文艺复兴的时候说过：“这是一个人类前所未有的最伟大的进步的革命，是一个需要而且产生了巨人……的时代。”我国无产阶级文化大革命是比欧洲文艺复兴伟大千百倍的革命，我们所处的时代是文艺复兴时期无法比拟的、以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。这样伟大的革命，这样伟大的时代，更是需要和产生千百万无产阶级的“巨人”。革命的小将在无产阶级文化大革命的风浪中，在对旧世界的大批判、大斗争中，一定能够成为用战无不胜的毛泽东思想武装起来的“巨人”，成为破坏旧世界、建设新世界的“巨人”。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，在青年时代的峥嵘岁月里，“指点江山，激扬文字”，对虎狼当道的旧世界进行了最无情最深刻的揭露和批判。这是多么广阔的胸怀，何等伟大的气魄！革命的红卫兵小将，一定要学习伟大领袖毛主席的光辉榜样，在革命大批判中做冲锋陷阵的急先锋！
                                            （七月二十一日）
