News friends from various countries have sent telegrams and published articles, expressing their anger and protest against the fascist atrocities of the British authorities in Hong Kong, and firmly supporting the just struggle of the Xinhua News Agency journalists.

	The entire staff of the Vietnam News Agency sent a telegram of support.

	Xinhua News Agency, July 21st: Xinhua News Agency received a telegram today from the entire staff of the Vietnam News Agency, expressing their indignation and condemnation of the British authorities in Hong Kong's atrocities, and their support for the just struggle of the Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch journalists. The telegram said, we are extremely indignant to learn that after the British authorities in Hong Kong illegally arrested comrade Xue Ping, they escalated their actions by arresting comrades Chen Fengying and Chen Demu. They also illegally sentenced Xue Ping to imprisonment, which is a further crime. We condemn this illegal behavior and demand that the British authorities in Hong Kong immediately release comrades Xue Ping, Chen Fengying, and Chen Demu, publicly admit their mistakes, and guarantee their freedom of action and personal safety.

	107 journalists and other workers from 32 countries in Beijing sent protest telegrams and letters.

	Xinhua News Agency, July 23rd: 107 journalists and other workers from 32 countries working in Beijing sent a telegram to the British authorities in Hong Kong and published a protest letter on July 21st, strongly protesting the British authorities in Hong Kong's unreasonable sentencing of Xinhua News Agency's Hong Kong branch journalist Xue Ping to two years in prison.

	In the protest telegram to the British authorities in Hong Kong, these 107 foreign journalists and other workers said, the British authorities' sentencing of Xinhua News Agency's journalist Xue Ping to two years in prison exposes the false democracy of Britain and reveals that British imperialism is running errands for American imperialism. The massacre, mass arrests, and beatings of Chinese residents in Hong Kong by British imperialism will provoke even stronger condemnation.

	The protest letter they published strongly protests and condemns the British authorities in Hong Kong's atrocities against local Chinese residents. The protest letter points out that these Chinese residents have the right to express their love and admiration for the great leader Chairman Mao Zedong.

	The protest letter demands the release of Xue Ping and guarantees that similar incidents will not happen again. The protest letter points out that Xue Ping's heroic demeanor in court embodies the fine tradition of the world revolutionary workers' movement. The protest letter calls on the progressive people of the world to condemn the British fascist authorities' attacks on Chinese residents in Hong Kong. These atrocities are premeditated and serve the American imperialist aggression against Vietnam and China.

	The "Construction Daily" in Pakistan published an editorial.

	Xinhua News Agency, Rawalpindi, July 22nd: The "Construction Daily" in Rawalpindi published an editorial on July 21st, strongly protesting the British authorities in Hong Kong's illegal arrest of Xinhua News Agency journalists and the illegal "sentencing" of Xue Ping to two years in prison. The editorial said that the actions of the British authorities in Hong Kong are extremely arbitrary and interfere with journalists' performance of their duties. The editorial said that all journalists demand that the British authorities in Hong Kong immediately release Xue Ping. The editorial pointed out that the charges made by the British court against Chinese journalists are extremely absurd, and all the accusations against Chinese journalists are fabricated, which shows the decay and decline of British colonialism.

    这一百零七名外国新闻工作者和其他工作人员在给香港英国当局的抗议电报中说，英国当局判决新华分社记者薛平两年徒刑，暴露了英国的虚假民主，暴露了英帝在为美帝奔走效劳。英帝国主义对香港中国居民的屠杀、大逮捕和殴打将激起更强烈的谴责。
