In the Mugma mining area of Dhanbad County, Bihar State, about 1,000 workers took up arms on the 11th to resist the oppression and suppression by the Indian reactionary government and capitalists.

The capitalist of a pottery factory in this area arbitrarily dismissed workers, which met with strong resistance from the workers. About 1,000 workers armed with bows, spears, and guns surrounded the factory.

The Bihar State government of the "Congress Party" sent a large number of police to suppress the workers. The workers fought back with weapons and stones. The administrative officer ordered the police to shoot and kill three workers and injure many others. The workers fought back vigorously, injuring one administrative officer who directed the suppression and several policemen.

According to a report by the Indian News Agency on the 16th, New Delhi: The Naga people in eastern India, who are fighting for national liberation against the reactionary rule of the Congress Party, often take flexible and active actions to severely strike the Indian reactionary military and police. Recently, they again inflicted a heavy blow on the reactionary government's police, achieving remarkable results.

According to a report by the Indian News Agency on the 13th, on the 12th, when the reactionary government's police force was moving along the Imphal-Tamenglong road, more than 100 Naga armed fighters swiftly attacked these lackeys of the reactionaries. The reactionary police struggled desperately, but they were defeated. The Naga armed fighters killed 23 policemen and seized all the weapons, ammunition, and rations from the police trucks. The Naga armed fighters also blew up an iron bridge near this road. Before this brilliant ambush, the Naga armed fighters also attacked a police outpost.

The Congress Party government, the tool of the Indian big landlords and big bourgeoisie, has long implemented a policy of extermination, including burning, killing, looting, and imprisonment, against the Naga people, arousing their intense class hatred. Since April this year, they have strengthened their armed struggle against the Congress Party government and have repeatedly taken the initiative to attack and defeat the reactionary military and police.

    在野兽面前决不表示丝毫怯懦
    印度一千矿工武力抗击警察镇压
    那加族人民武装伏击反动军警取得显著战果
    据新华社讯　新德里消息：在比哈尔邦丹巴德县穆格马矿区的一千名工人十一日武力抗击印度反动政府和资本家的压迫和镇压。
    这个区的一家陶器厂的资本家无理解雇工人，遭到了工人强烈的反抗。大约一千名用弓箭、长矛和枪支武装起来的工人包围了工厂。
    “非国大党”的比哈尔邦政府出动大批警察赶来镇压，工人就用武器和石块与警察搏斗。行政长官竟然命令警察开枪打死三名工人，打伤多名。工人们对警察进行了有力的还击，一名指挥镇压工人的行政长官和多名警察被打伤。
    据新华社十六日讯　新德里消息：正在为争取民族解放反对国大党反动统治而坚持武装斗争的印度东部那加族人民，经常灵活机动地积极出击，狠狠打击印度反动军警。最近，他们又痛歼反动政府的警察，取得显著战果。
    据印度报业托辣斯十三日报道，十二日，正当反动政府的警察部队乘车在英帕尔—塔孟隆公路上行进时，那加族武装一百多人，神速地袭击这些反动派的帮凶。反动警察拚命挣扎，但是，他们被打得一败涂地。那加族武装打死二十三个警察，并缴获警察卡车上的全部武器、弹药和口粮。那加族武装还炸毁了这条公路附近的铁桥。在这次漂亮的伏击以前，那加族武装还袭击了一个警察哨所。
    印度大地主大资产阶级专政的工具国大党政府，长期以来对那加族人民实行烧、杀、抢、关等种族灭绝政策，激起那加族人民无比强烈的阶级仇恨。他们从今年四月份以来，加强了反对国大党政府的武装斗争，多次主动出击，痛打反动派的军警。
