The article "Revolutionary Teachers, We Welcome You!" by the "August 18th" revolutionary youngsters is a piece that hits the nail on the head, pointing out the problems among teachers—the "three fears." It is a wonderful article brimming with revolutionary passion. We cheer for it and applaud it!

The article is good because it uses Mao Zedong Thought as a revolutionary microscope to give teachers a "physical examination," uncovering some "germs" deep in their souls.

The article is good because the youngsters, following Chairman Mao's teachings, adopt an attitude of treating the illness to save the patient. They raise issues and sincerely point out the medicine for curing the illness—to study and apply Chairman Mao's works actively.

Why is there "fear"? Every revolutionary teacher must answer this question raised by the youngsters. There can be no ambiguity, and it must not be avoided.

Selflessness leads to fearlessness. Without removing the "self," how can one avoid the "fear"? Breaking away from "self" to establish "public" spirit. Without a "public" spirit, how can one achieve "daring"? Currently, to carry out the revolution and resume classes, teachers must boldly carry out their work. To do a good job in the school, to carry the Cultural Revolution to the end, all revolutionary teachers and students must unite closely and fight together, achieving revolutionary great unity. This requires a strong emphasis on "public" spirit. The youngsters have already given us a pat on the back. Comrades, it's time to move forward!

"Many things are urgent; the world turns, time presses. Ten thousand years is too long, we strive for every moment." Revolutionary teachers, revolutionary youngsters, let us quickly unite and join forces to fight together!

　　为革命小将的文章叫好
　　“八·一八”革命小将的《革命的老师，我们欢迎你！》这篇文章，一针见血地指出了教师当中存在的问题——“三怕”，是一篇洋溢着革命激情的好文章。我们为之欢呼，为之叫好！
    文章好就好在他们能够运用毛泽东思想这一革命的显微镜，给教师作了一次“体格检查”，找出了一些教师的灵魂深处的“细菌”。
    文章好就好在小将们能够遵照毛主席的教导，抱着治病救人的态度，提出问题，并且诚恳地给教师指出治病的良药——活学活用毛主席著作。
    为什么会“怕”？每个革命教师都必须回答小将们提出的这个问题，不能含糊，更不能回避。
    无私才能无畏。没有去掉“私”字，又怎能避开那个“怕”字？破“私”才能立“公”。没有一个“公”字，又怎能取得一个“敢”字？在当前，要搞好复课闹革命，教师们就必须大胆地开展工作。要搞好学校的工作，要将文化大革命进行到底，全校革命师生就必须紧紧地团结在一起，战斗在一起，实现革命的大联合。这就必须大力提倡一个“公”字。小将们已在我们后面击了一猛掌，同志们，该前进了！
    “多少事，从来急；天地转，光阴迫。一万年太久，只争朝夕。”革命的教师，革命的小将们，让我们赶快团结起来，联合起来，共同战斗吧！
    上海市永兴路第二小学革命教师
