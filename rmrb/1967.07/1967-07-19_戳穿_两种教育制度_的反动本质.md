	Editor's Note: The biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party have consistently and frenziedly opposed Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line. They attempt to use the educational front to cultivate successors to the bourgeoisie, aiming to restore capitalism in China.

	In the spring of 1964, Chairman Mao made serious criticisms of the educational work and issued extremely important directives for educational reform. To resist Chairman Mao's directives, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party hastily put forward a program of "two labor systems, two educational systems." This is a thoroughly counter-revolutionary, revisionist educational program.

	The so-called "two labor systems, two educational systems" is nothing but a copy of the capitalist educational "dual-track system." On the one hand, it preserves the old bourgeois educational system intact, attempting to cultivate a small number of people into spiritual aristocrats who stand above the laboring people. On the other hand, it promotes a "half-work, half-study" system that does not advocate revolution, does not emphasize politics, and focuses solely on labor skills and economic benefits, aiming to cultivate the majority into technical workers serving the bourgeoisie.

	To promote his so-called "half-work, half-study," the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party has dressed it up in Marxism-Leninism, claiming it to be an important measure to "prevent and combat revisionism" and a "fundamental path to transition to communism." He has been deceiving people everywhere and using his authority and a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists to implement and promote it.

	Now, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has entered a new decisive stage. We must firmly hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, launch a fierce attack on the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, and on his counter-revolutionary, revisionist educational line. We must thoroughly criticize and expose his so-called "two labor systems, two educational systems"!

	Exposing the Reactionary Nature of the "Two Educational Systems"

	Education Department, Yan'an Commune

	In May 1964, after long-term preparation, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party put forward a revisionist educational program of "two labor systems, two educational systems," openly opposing Chairman Mao's proletarian educational line.

	To promote this revisionist educational program, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party claimed that the "two labor systems, two educational systems" are the "fundamental systems of socialist construction," the "educational systems of communism," the "fundamental measures to consolidate proletarian dictatorship and prevent the restoration of capitalism," and the "fundamental path to eliminate the three major differences, build socialism, and transition to communism." His loyal henchmen also praised this revisionist educational program to the skies. They said that implementing the "two labor systems, two educational systems" is a "major revolutionary measure" with profound significance for China's socialist revolution and socialist construction.

	Are the "two labor systems, two educational systems" really so wonderful? No, this is all deceit. On the contrary, it is a crucial part of the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party's evil plan to restore capitalism in China.

	In Name, Reducing the Three Major Differences; In Reality, Expanding Them

	What exactly are the "two educational systems"?

	The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party said: "I think our country should have two main types of school education systems." That is: "One is the current full-time school education system, primary school, middle school, university, all day long studying," this school "is run by the state, with high quality requirements," "probably to be done for a hundred years, two hundred years, three hundred years"; the other is the "half-work, half-study school education system," this school "has economic purposes, both personal and national economic purposes, because the first type of school cannot absorb so many students, families cannot afford it, and they cannot pass the exams, so they have to work and study by themselves, the outstanding ones enter the first type, the less outstanding ones enter the second type."

	In other words, he advocates that students whose families can afford it and who are "outstanding" should go to the first type of school; students whose families cannot afford it and who are "less outstanding" should go to the second type of school. This is the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party's design for us to "eliminate the three major differences," "build communism," and "prevent revisionism."

	This is completely a fraud.

	The "two educational systems" promoted by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party are not a "revolutionary measure" to "reduce" or "eliminate" the three major differences, but are precisely reactionary measures to vigorously retain and expand the three major differences.

	He proposed the "two educational systems" not from the perspective of reducing the three major differences, but from the perspective of benefiting the retention of these differences, benefiting the cultivation of the bourgeoisie's spiritual aristocrats and privileged classes. From the early days of liberation, he has been vigorously advocating the establishment of "regular" universities. As late as 1956, he still insisted on the fallacy that "China's universal education is not so urgent at the moment, the current issue is still higher education, still the expert issue." However, after liberation, especially after 1956, the demand of the laboring people's children for education has become increasingly strong. The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party, on the surface, pretended to be concerned about the education of the children of the laboring people, and took the opportunity to throw out his half-work, half-study black goods, attempting to cultivate the majority of the children of the laboring people into labor forces serving the capitalist system. What he really cared about was the "state-run, high-quality" full-time schools. Within the full-time school system, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party and his gang selected and focused on a complete set of "key primary schools," "key middle schools," "key universities," as the key within the key, called the "small pagoda" system.

	Who can enter this "small pagoda"? "Families that can afford it go to the first type of school, families that cannot afford it go to the second type of school," "outstanding ones go to the first type of school, less outstanding ones go to the second type of school." The admission standards set by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party actually make it even harder for the children of the laboring people to enter "key schools" than to climb to the sky. Even if they are admitted, they often face various difficulties and are even expelled on various pretexts. Thus, entering the "small pagoda" becomes a privilege for a few.

	Chairman Mao pointed out as early as 1957: "Our educational policy should enable the educated to develop in morality, intelligence, and physical education, and become laborers with socialist consciousness and culture." However, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party blatantly distorted this policy. He set a training goal for the second type of school, that is, the so-called "training laborers with socialist consciousness, cultural and scientific knowledge, skills, and practical operational abilities." As for all the schools listed in the "small pagoda" system, they all have their own independent training goals. For example, in Tsinghua University, Jiang Xingxing's training goal is "red engineers," who are the "backbone" of the "political life of the state" "several decades later"; in China Medical University, a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party took American and old Peking Union Medical College professors and doctors as their training goals; in Jing Shan School, Lu Dingyi and his gang even openly proposed to train "county committee secretaries, propaganda department heads, women's federation directors, central committee members, premiers, leaders, politicians, military leaders, diplomats" in this school. Thus, those who enter the half-work, half-study schools are destined to be skilled workers and peasants for life, while those who enter the "small pagoda" system are destined to become "leaders," "experts," and privileged classes.

	The training methods of these two types of schools are also completely different. One type of school is basically "studying all day," detached from labor, politics, class struggle, and reality, "two ears do not hear outside affairs, one heart only reads the classics." They instill a large amount of feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism into the younger generation. The other type of school, on the other hand, makes students participate in labor, solve "educational funds," "make money," and train labor forces as their main goals.

	On the one hand, through the first type of schools, especially the "small pagoda," they cultivate ruling talents, cultivate privileged classes and spiritual aristocrats, cultivate the "backbone" of the "political life of the state"; on the other hand, through the second type of schools, that is, half-work, half-study schools, they cultivate those who master production technology and are ruled, cultivate their "tame tools." This is the essence of the "two educational systems." The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party is so eager to promote the "two educational systems" because his goal is to attempt to select and cultivate successors to the bourgeoisie through it, usurp the proletarian dictatorship, and change the color of our country.

	Using Capitalist Half-Work, Half-Study to Impersonate Socialist Half-Work, Half-Study

	Promoting the "two educational systems" is to prepare conditions for the restoration of capitalism, but advocating half-work, half-study is not wrong, right? The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party might want to grasp at this straw.

	But this is in vain.

	The half-work, half-study school education form can be implemented by the bourgeoisie, and it can also be implemented by the proletariat. The bourgeoisie, in order to obtain a reserve labor force that masters skilled production technology, needs to provide workers with necessary educational opportunities. Training workers through the half-work, half-study form is in line with their own class interests. Under the socialist system, if Chairman Mao's educational policy is implemented, half-work, half-study can cultivate successors to the proletariat. Therefore, we have never denied this form of education. On the contrary, Chairman Mao has always advocated using the half-work, half-study form to promote the combination of education and productive labor. However, without the class content of half-work, half-study, deviating from Chairman Mao's educational policy, and thinking that half-work, half-study is "socialist in nature," that implementing half-work, half-study can "eliminate the three major differences" and "transition to communism," this is extremely reactionary in theory and extremely harmful in practice.

	The half-work, half-study advocated by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party is the bourgeoisie's half-work, half-study, aimed at cultivating "tame tools" according to the requirements of his "Cultivation."

	We only need to look at the more than twenty reports made by this biggest capitalist-roader within the Party since 1964 to prove this point. In these speeches, he did not mention Chairman Mao's series of directives on educational work at all and did not mention using Chairman Mao's works to arm the younger generation. Implementing half-work, half-study without the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought can only be the bourgeoisie's revisionist half-work, half-study.

	In these speeches, he did not mention the class struggle in socialist society at all, did not mention the class struggle on the educational front, did not mention the class struggle for the younger generation, but instead talked about how "half-work, half-study itself is class struggle," and that as long as half-work, half-study is implemented, it can "eliminate classes" and "eliminate the three major differences." If we follow his absurd logic, then the United States implemented half-work, half-study many years ago, so they have long "eliminated" classes and "eliminated" the "three major differences." This is the biggest deception! The biggest capitalist-roader within the Party deliberately obscures the class struggle on the educational front, which opens the door wide for the bourgeoisie to occupy the educational front and seize the younger generation.

	Chairman Mao has repeatedly taught us that politics is the soul, and we must emphasize proletarian politics. However, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party emphasized technical leadership, saying that "when workers' production technology is improved, production can develop, and then various abilities can be fully utilized, and distribution can be based on needs," saying that schools "managed well" will have a good spiritual outlook and high enthusiasm among the masses. In his speeches, he also asked everyone to "calculate" in half-work, half-study to make money without losing money. Under this ideological guidance, some leaders of half-work, half-study schools treat students as unpaid labor forces and turn half-work, half-study schools into capitalist profit-making institutions.

	The fundamental issue of the revolution is the issue of power. The nature of half-work, half-study ultimately depends on who holds the leadership. However, in these speeches, the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party deliberately avoided this crucial issue. His purpose is to weaken the proletarian class struggle, protect a small clique of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and consolidate the rule of bourgeois intellectuals over schools.

	In short, without Mao Zedong Thought, without class struggle, without proletarian leadership, and simply implementing a "half-work, half-study" teaching form, this is the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party's conspiracy to restore capitalism under the pretext of eliminating the three major differences. We must expose the reactionary nature of the "two educational systems" and criticize it thoroughly.

	We must follow the spirit of Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive," inherit and carry forward the educational tradition of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University, and run good socialist "half-work, half-study" schools, turning the entire educational front into a big school of Mao Zedong Thought.

专栏：

    编者按：党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，一贯疯狂地反对毛主席的无产阶级教育路线。他妄图利用教育阵地来培养资产阶级的接班人，在中国复辟资本主义。
    一九六四年春节，毛主席对教育工作进行了严肃的批评，提出了改革教育的极为重要的指示。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为了抗拒毛主席的指示，迫不及待地抛出了一个“两种劳动制度、两种教育制度”的纲领。这是一个彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义的教育纲领。
    所谓“两种劳动制度、两种教育制度”，不过是资本主义教育的“双轨制”的翻版。即一方面原封不动地保存旧的资产阶级教育制度，妄图把少数人培养成为高踞于劳动人民之上的精神贵族；另一方面推行不要革命、不讲政治、片面强调劳动技术、单纯追求经济收益的“半工半读”制度，妄图把大多数人培养成为资产阶级服务的技术工人。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为了推销他的所谓“半工半读”，给它披上了马列主义的外衣，把它说成是“防修反修”的重要措施，是“过渡到共产主义的根本途径”。他到处招摇撞骗，并利用职权和通过一小撮反革命修正主义分子贯彻推行。
    现在，无产阶级文化大革命已经进入了一个新的决战阶段。我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派猛烈开火，向他的反革命修正主义的教育路线猛烈开火，把他的所谓“两种劳动制度、两种教育制度”批深批透，批倒批臭！
    戳穿“两种教育制度”的反动本质
    教育部　延安公社
    一九六四年五月，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在经过长期的酝酿和准备之后，抛出一个“两种劳动制度、两种教育制度”的修正主义教育纲领，公开地反对毛主席的无产阶级教育路线。
    为了推销这个修正主义教育纲领，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派鼓吹说：“两种劳动制度、两种教育制度”，是“社会主义建设的根本制度”，是“共产主义的教育制度”，是“巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟的根本措施”，是“消灭三大差别，建成社会主义，过渡到共产主义的根本途径”。他的忠实爪牙们也把这个修正主义教育纲领捧上了天。他们胡说什么，实行
  “两种劳动制度、两种教育制度”是“重大的革命措施，对我国社会主义革命和社会主义建设事业具有深远意义”。
    “两种劳动制度、两种教育制度”，果真是这样美妙吗？不，这全是欺人之谈。恰恰相反，它是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派妄图在中国复辟资本主义的罪恶计划的一个重要组成部分。
    名为缩小三大差别，实为扩大三大差别
    所谓“两种教育制度”，到底是一种什么货色呢？
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派说：“我想，我们国家应该有两种主要的学校教育制度”。即：“一种是现在的全日制的学校教育制度，小学、中学、大学，整天都是读书”，这种学校“是国家办的，质量要求高”，“大概要搞一百年、二百年、三百年”；另一种是“半工半读的学校教育制度”，这种学校“有经济目的，个人和国家都有经济目的，因为第一类学校吸收不了这么多学生，家庭也供不起，自己又考不取，因此，就要不靠家庭，不靠国家，自己作工读书，优秀的考上第一类，次一些的就进入第二类”。
    这就是说，他主张家庭供得起的、“优秀”的学生，上第一类学校；家庭供不起的、“次一些”的学生，上第二类学校。这就是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为我们设计的“消灭三大差别”、“建成共产主义”、“防止修正主义”的蓝图。
    这完全是一个骗局。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所推销的“两种教育制度”，绝不是一种“缩小”或“消灭”三大差别的“革命措施”，而正是一种极力保留和扩大三大差别的反动措施。
    他提出“两种教育制度”，本来就不是从缩小三大差别的目的出发的，而是从有利于保留这种差别、有利于培养资产阶级的精神贵族和特权阶层出发的。他从解放初起就大肆鼓吹举办“正规”的大学。直到一九五六年，他还坚持中国“普及教育当前还不是那么紧，当前还是高等教育，还是专家问题”的谬论。但是解放后，特别是一九五六年后，劳动人民子弟的升学要求越来越强烈。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派表面上装出一副关心劳动人民子女入学的样子，乘机抛出他那套半工半读的黑货，企图把大多数劳动人民子女培养成为资本主义制度服务的劳动力。而他真正关心的，还是那种“由国家办的，质量要求高”的全日制学校。在全日制的学校体系中，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其一伙又选择和重点举办一整套“重点小学”、“重点中学”、“重点大学”，做为重点中的重点，称之为“小宝塔”系统。
    什么人才能够进入这个“小宝塔”呢？“家庭供得起的，上第一类学校，家庭供不起的上第二类学校”，“优秀的考第一类学校，次些的进第二类学校”。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派规定的这个入学标准，实际上使得劳动人民的子女进入“重点学校”比登天还要难。他们即使被录取，也往往受到种种刁难，甚至以种种借口把他们“淘汰”出去。这样，进入“小宝塔”便成了少数人的特权。
    毛主席早在一九五七年就指出：“我们的教育方针，应该使受教育者在德育、智育、体育几方面都得到发展，成为有社会主义觉悟的有文化的劳动者。”而党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却公然篡改这个方针。他为第二类学校规定了一个培养目标，即所谓“培养有社会主义觉悟、有文化科学知识、有技术、有实际操作能力的新型劳动者”。而凡是列入“小宝塔”系统的“重点学校”，则都有自己的独立的培养目标。例如在清华大学，蒋××提出的培养目标是
  “红色工程师”，是“几十年后”“国家政治生活中”的“骨干”；在中国医科大学，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派把美国和旧协和的教授、博士做为自己的培养目标；在景山学校，陆定一及其一伙居然公开提出要在这个学校培养“县委书记、宣传部长、妇联主任、中央委员、总理、领袖等政治家、军事家、外交家”。这样，进入半工半读学校的，就决定了他们只能一辈子当有技术的工人和农民，而进入“小宝塔”系统的，便决定了他们要当“领导”，当“专家”，成为特权阶层。
    这两类学校的培养方法也是完全不同的。一种学校基本上是“整天都是读书”，脱离劳动，脱离政治，脱离阶级斗争，脱离实际，“两耳不闻窗外事，一心只读圣贤书”。他们把大量的封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的东西灌输给青年一代。另一种学校则把学生参加劳动，解决“教育经费”，“赚钱”，训练劳动力，列为自己的主要目标。
    一方面，通过第一类学校、特别是“小宝塔”，培养统治人材，培养特权阶层和精神贵族，培养“国家政治生活中的骨干”；另一方面通过第二类学校，即半工半读学校，培养掌握生产技术的被统治者，培养他们的“驯服工具”。这就是“两种教育制度”的本质。中国最大的走资本主义道路当权派如此卖力地推销“两种教育制度”，其目的是妄图通过它选择和培养资产阶级的接班人，篡夺无产阶级的政权，使我们的国家改变颜色。
    用资本主义半工半读冒充社会主义半工半读
    搞“两种教育制度”是为复辟资本主义准备条件，但是，提倡半工半读总没有错吧？党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派可能想从这里捞半根稻草。
    但这是徒然的。
    半工半读这种学校教育形式，资产阶级可以搞，无产阶级也可以搞。资产阶级为了获得掌握熟练生产技术的后备劳动力，是需要给工人以必要的受教育的机会的。通过半工半读这种形式来训练工人，这是符合他们自己的阶级利益的。在社会主义制度下，如果贯彻毛主席的教育方针，半工半读就可以培养无产阶级接班人。因此，我们从来并不否定半工半读这种教育形式。相反地，毛主席一向提倡通过半工半读这种教育形式，来促进教育和生产劳动相结合。但是，离开了半工半读的阶级内容，违背了毛主席的教育方针，以为半工半读就是“社会主义性质”的，搞了半工半读就可以“消灭三大差别”，可以“过渡到共产主义”，这在理论上是十分反动的，在实践上是十分有害的。
    中国党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所提倡的半工半读，是资产阶级的半工半读，是为了按照他的《修养》的要求培养“驯服工具”的半工半读。
    我们只要看一看这个党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派一九六四年以来二十多次的报告，就可以证明这点。他在这些讲话中，根本不提毛主席对教育工作的一系列指示，根本不提用毛主席的著作去武装青年一代。离开毛泽东思想的指导去搞半工半读，只能是资产阶级的修正主义的半工半读。
    他在这些讲话中，绝口不提社会主义社会的阶级斗争，绝口不提教育战线上的阶级斗争，绝口不提争夺青年一代的阶级斗争，反而大讲什么“半工半读本身就是阶级斗争”，只要搞了半工半读就可以“消灭阶级”、“消灭三大差别”。如果按照他这个荒谬的逻辑，那末，美国在许多年前就实行了半工半读，岂不是它们早就“消灭”了阶级，“消失”了“三大差别”。这真是最大的欺骗！党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派有意抹杀教育战线上的阶级斗争，这是给资产阶级占领教育阵地、争夺青年一代大开方便之门。
    毛主席一再教导我们，政治是灵魂，要突出无产阶级的政治。而党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却大讲技术挂帅，说什么“工人生产技术提高了，生产才能发展，到那时候，就可以实行各尽所能，按需分配”，说什么学校“经营管理好了”，“人的精神面貌就会好，群众热情就会高”。他在讲话中还要大家在半工半读中“打算盘”，使之赚钱而不亏本。在这种思想指导下，有的半工半读的学校领导人把学生当成了无偿劳动力，把半工半读学校办成了资产阶级的营利机构。
    革命的根本问题是政权问题。半工半读的性质归根结底也是决定于领导权掌握在什么人手中。可是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在这些讲话中，有意回避这个要害问题。其目的是要削弱无产阶级的阶级斗争，保护党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，巩固资产阶级知识分子对学校的统治。
    说到底，离开了毛泽东思想，离开了阶级斗争，离开了无产阶级的领导，单纯搞一个“半工半读”的教学形式，这是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在消灭三大差别的幌子下，复辟资本主义的一个阴谋。我们必须戳穿“两种教育制度”的反动本质，把它批深批透。
    我们一定要按照毛主席“五·七”指示的精神，继承和发扬“抗大”的教育传统，办好社会主义的“半工半读”，把整个教育战线都办成毛泽东思想的大学校。
