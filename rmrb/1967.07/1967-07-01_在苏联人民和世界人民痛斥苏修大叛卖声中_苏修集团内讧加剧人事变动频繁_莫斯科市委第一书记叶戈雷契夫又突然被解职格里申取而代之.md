In the midst of the Soviet and world peoples' condemnation of the Soviet revisionists' great betrayal, the internal strife within the Soviet revisionist group has intensified, and personnel changes have become frequent. Yegorychev, the First Secretary of the Moscow City Committee, has been suddenly dismissed, and Grishin has taken his place.

New China News Agency, June 30th: Moscow reports that just as the Soviet revisionist group, in this Middle East incident, has become the accomplice of American imperialism, betraying the interests of the Arab people, and is facing strong condemnation from the Soviet and world peoples, and intense arguments within the Soviet revisionist group, a key figure in the Soviet revisionist ruling group, Yegorychev, has been suddenly relieved of his duties as the First Secretary of the Moscow City Committee.

According to a report by the Soviet TASS on the 28th, the full meeting of the Moscow City Committee of the CPSU relieved Yegorychev of his duties as the First Secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the CPSU. At the same time, Grishin, a candidate member of the CPSU Central Committee Presidium, took over Yegorychev's position as the First Secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the CPSU.

The Soviet revisionist ruling group took extremely swift action in relieving Yegorychev of his duties, using an emergency procedure. It is reported that the full meeting of the Moscow City Committee of the CPSU, which relieved Yegorychev of his duties, lasted only fifteen minutes, and the agenda had only one item: Grishin taking over Yegorychev's position. Grishin, upon taking up this new position, had not yet found a successor for his original position as the Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions.

Since the Khrushchev group usurped the power of the Soviet Party and state, Grishin has consistently faithfully executed the Khrushchev revisionist line. Since 1956, he has been the Chairman of the All-Union Central Council of Trade Unions. Since 1961, he has been elected as a candidate member of the CPSU Central Committee Presidium. He is an infamous anti-China figure, having repeatedly directed anti-China activities at international conferences such as the World Federation of Trade Unions.

Yegorychev, who was relieved of his duties, has been the First Secretary of the Moscow City Committee of the CPSU since 1962, actively promoting and implementing the revisionist line.

People have noticed that this is another intriguing personnel change within the Soviet revisionist ruling group in recent months. Since April, TASS Director Golunov, Chairman of the State Security Committee Shelepin, and the head of the Soviet Azerbaijani security agency Tsvigon have successively been dismissed, indicating that the internal power struggle within the Soviet revisionist ruling group has become increasingly sharp.

　　在苏联人民和世界人民痛斥苏修大叛卖声中
　　苏修集团内讧加剧人事变动频繁
　　莫斯科市委第一书记叶戈雷契夫又突然被解职格里申取而代之
    新华社三十日讯　莫斯科消息：正当苏联修正主义集团在这次中东事件中，由于充当美帝国主义的帮凶，出卖阿拉伯人民利益，遭到苏联人民和世界人民强烈谴责，苏修内部激烈争吵的时候，苏修统治集团中一名重要人物叶戈雷契夫，突然被解除他担任的莫斯科市委第一书记的职务。
    据苏联塔斯社二十八日报道：苏共莫斯科市委员会全体会议解除了叶戈雷契夫苏共莫斯科市委第一书记职务。同时，由苏共中央主席团候补委员格里申接替叶戈雷契夫担任苏共莫斯科市委员会第一书记。
    苏修统治集团在解除叶戈雷契夫职务时采取了非常迅速的行动，使用了紧急的程序。据透露的消息说，解除叶戈雷契夫职务时苏共莫斯科市委会全体会议，只进行了十五分钟，会议议程也只有一个项目，即格里申接替叶戈雷契夫的职务。格里申在接任这一新职务时，他原来担任的全苏工会中央理事会主席职务还未来得及找人接替。
    格里申从赫鲁晓夫集团篡夺苏联党和国家的权力以来，一贯忠实执行赫鲁晓夫修正主义路线。他从一九五六年起担任全苏工会中央理事会主席。一九六一年起，被选为苏共中央主席团候补委员。他是臭名昭著的反华干将，曾经多次在世界工联会议等国际会议上指挥反华。
    被解除职务的叶戈雷契夫，自一九六二年起一直担任苏共莫斯科市委第一书记，积极鼓吹和推行修正主义路线。
    人们注意到，这是近几个月来苏修统治集团又一次引人寻味的人事变动。从今年四月以后，塔斯社社长戈留诺夫，国家安全委员会主席谢米恰斯内伊和苏联阿塞拜疆保安机关头目茨维贡等人先后被解职，表明苏修统治集团内部勾心斗角之争日益尖锐。
