The Red Star Brigade of Yongfa Commune in Bayan County, Heilongjiang Province, has been actively studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon. By combining their personal experiences with facts, they have launched a revolutionary criticism campaign targeting the reactionary fallacies of the Chinese Khrushchev, raising the level of revolutionary criticism and local struggle, criticism, and reform. They have also enthusiastically praised the great leader Chairman Mao and the boundless Mao Zedong Thought, pushing the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works to new heights, promoting the thought revolution of the people, and consolidating revolutionary unity.

Recalling hardships and criticizing the "exploitation is beneficial" theory; praising Chairman Mao and resolutely following him to make revolution

Chairman Mao teaches us: "In a society where class struggle exists, if the exploiting class has the freedom to exploit the laboring people, the laboring people will not have the freedom not to be exploited."

The revolutionary criticism movement in the Red Star Brigade is carried out in accordance with Chairman Mao's teachings, starting from recalling hardships and sweetness. They target the "exploitation is beneficial" and "laboring people welcome exploitation" fallacies propagated by the Chinese Khrushchev. With poor and lower-middle peasants as the main force and Red Guards and militia as the backbone, they have extensively and deeply carried out recalling hardships and sweetness activities, arousing the revolutionary sentiments of the broad revolutionary masses. They angrily criticize the Chinese Khrushchev and his henchmen in Heilongjiang; enthusiastically praise the great achievements of Chairman Mao. The better the recalling of hardships and sweetness is done, the deeper the special criticism is carried out. Each recalling of hardships arouses a thousand family grudges; each recalling of sweetness arouses the boundless love of the broad poor and lower-middle peasants for Chairman Mao.

At a mass meeting held in the second production brigade to recall hardships and criticize the "exploitation is beneficial" theory, old poor peasant Wei Guangyou tearfully recounted the blood-stained class suffering inflicted on his family by landlords and capitalists in the old society. On the spot, more than sixty people could not help but shed tears of hatred. Both on and off the stage, everyone angrily shouted: "Never forget class suffering, always remember blood grudges!" "Exploitation is a crime, deserving a thousand deaths!" "Down with the Chinese Khrushchev!" When Wei Guangyou spoke of how Chairman Mao saved his family from the pit of suffering, enabling his three brothers who were wandering to reunite and become masters, the entire audience repeatedly raised their arms and shouted: "Long live Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

People recall the past and look at today, hating the Chinese Khrushchev and capitalism; loving Chairman Mao and socialism. Old poor peasant Wang Shuren said: The old society was one where landlords and capitalists ate the flesh and drank the blood of the laboring people. The exploitation of landlords and capitalists is not only a crime but a heinous crime. Whoever says "exploitation is not a crime," "exploitation is beneficial," I will stake my life to fight to the end! Some young people from poor peasant backgrounds also expressed at the meeting that they would not forget their roots, not forget class suffering, always remember blood grudges, never be fooled by class enemies, and always follow Chairman Mao to make revolution.

Recalling the history of class struggle, criticizing the "class struggle is extinguished" theory; praising proletarian dictatorship and vowing to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The imperialists and domestic reactionaries will not readily accept their defeat. They will still make their last struggles. After the country is pacified, they will still engage in sabotage and disruption in various ways. They will attempt to restore capitalism in China every day and every hour."

The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the Red Star Brigade, in using Chairman Mao's teachings to criticize the Chinese Khrushchev's "class struggle is extinguished" theory, linked it with the history of class struggle in their local area and village. Chairman Mao's wise judgments and the sharp and complex class struggle facts in their local area and village made the broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres deeply realize that the Chinese Khrushchev's propaganda of the "class struggle is extinguished" theory is to serve him and his gang, as well as the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, in their attempt to overthrow proletarian dictatorship and restore capitalism. In fact, the struggle between class enemies' restoration and the proletariat's anti-restoration has always existed.

At the beginning of the special criticism, the poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of this brigade recalled in segments the history of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines in their local area and village over the past eighteen years since liberation. Through the recalling by the masses, they laid out a large number of evil facts of the class enemies in their local area and village plotting to usurp political power and restore capitalism. The landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements in this village, during the land reform struggle, wrote down accounts of changing the sky, and at the slightest breeze, they would stir; during the cooperative movement, they poisoned draft animals, attempting to destroy the cooperative; during the people's commune movement, they created the counter-revolutionary public opinion that "the commune is not as good as the cooperative, the cooperative is not as good as the mutual aid team, the mutual aid team is not as good as individual farming," attempting to restore capitalism; when the Kuomintang bandits were clamoring to invade the mainland, they surveyed the land boundaries, verified the land boundaries, plotting to counterattack and settle old scores; during the three years of temporary difficulties caused by severe natural disasters, they pulled out and pushed in, plotting to usurp political power; during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, they usurped the leadership of the cultural revolution, implemented the bourgeois reactionary line, persecuted and framed up activists of the "Four Clean-ups" movement, and carried out extensive rehabilitation activities.

These sharp and complex class struggles made everyone's hearts tremble.

Poor peasant member Guo Jianyou said: The Chinese Khrushchev's propaganda of the "class struggle is extinguished" theory is purely deceitful, providing cover for the small clique of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, represented by the Chinese Khrushchev, as well as the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, in their attempt to restore capitalism and turn proletarian dictatorship into bourgeois dictatorship. The class enemies have never been honest. They appear honest on the surface but hide daggers in their smiles. They are still alive but their hearts are not dead. We must not be fooled by the Chinese Khrushchev and must never relax our vigilance. Old poor peasant Gu Chang'en said: If we believe the Chinese Khrushchev's lies, we will truly be beheaded without knowing how we were beheaded. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, never forget class struggle, never forget proletarian dictatorship, vow to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, firmly grasp the reins of power, and ensure that the socialist iron mountain will never change color for thousands of years.

The criticism of the Chinese Khrushchev has enhanced the proletarian sentiments among the revolutionary masses, promoting revolutionary unity. In some brigades, the ideological knots that had not been resolved between the two revolutionary factions were untied during this criticism. Through the recalling and comparison of the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, they identified the common enemy, eliminated misunderstandings, strengthened unity, and directed their arrows at the Chinese Khrushchev.

Recalling the history of collectivization, criticizing the "four freedoms" and "three selfs and one package"; praising socialism and resolutely following the socialist road

Chairman Mao teaches us: "After the people overthrew the rule of imperialism, feudalism, and bureaucratic capitalism, where should China go? Towards capitalism or towards socialism? ... The facts have already answered this question: Only socialism can save China."

The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the Red Star Brigade, in accordance with Chairman Mao's great teachings, have thoroughly criticized and exposed the Chinese Khrushchev and his henchmen's propaganda of the "four freedoms," "three selfs and one package," and other reactionary fallacies from a political, ideological, and theoretical standpoint. In the special revolutionary criticism, they firmly grasped the central link of recalling the history of collectivization, extensively mobilizing the masses to recall and summarize the history of collectivization from mutual aid teams to people's communes and the history of the struggle between the two roads. The broad poor and lower-middle peasants, through recalling and comparing, loved socialism even more and loved Chairman Mao even more, hating the Chinese Khrushchev who attempted to restore capitalism.

The poor and lower-middle peasants of the second production brigade recalled the situation before and after collectivization in their brigade during the criticism: After land reform and before cooperation, among the more than twenty poor peasant households in the entire brigade, three sold their land, and fifteen were again subjected to usury. The poor and lower-middle peasant members also recalled the situation a few years ago when, under the propaganda of the Chinese Khrushchev, the countryside saw a "single farming wind," and capitalist forces were rampant for a time. These ironclad facts made the members see clearly, arousing their hatred. They unanimously denounced the crimes of the Chinese Khrushchev and a small clique of counter-revolutionary revisionists in their province who propagated the "four freedoms" and "three selfs and one package." They said: "The 'four freedoms' and 'three selfs and one package' are of the same kind as the 'three knives' (land rent, usury, and miscellaneous taxes) on the heads of peasants in the old society. They want us to go back to the old road, suffer twice, and become beasts of burden again. We will never agree to this! Not in a thousand years! Not in ten thousand years!" They recalled that when the entire brigade was in the mutual aid team, there were only three horses, one cow, one plow, and one broken iron cart, while today it has developed to thirty-five horses and four large rubber carts, and the grain yield per mu has increased from over one hundred jin to over three hundred jin. The members unanimously praised socialism and unanimously cheered for the people's commune. Poor peasant Li Gui said: Only by following the socialist road pointed out by Chairman Mao can we walk the bright road to communism and never go back to the old road and suffer twice.

Thus, recalling, criticizing, and praising at the same time, not only made the broad members see more clearly the ugly face of the Chinese Khrushchev, received education on the struggle between the two roads, but also further raised the socialist awareness of the members. The broad members are determined to break private interests and establish public interests, manage the collective economy of the people's commune better, and give the Chinese Khrushchev a hard blow.

Recalling personal growth history, criticizing the shameless slanders against Mao Zedong Thought; praising the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, always holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought

Vice Chairman Lin Biao said: "Mao Zedong Thought is the Marxism-Leninism of the era when imperialism is heading towards comprehensive collapse and socialism is heading towards worldwide victory. Mao Zedong Thought is a powerful ideological weapon against imperialism, a powerful ideological weapon against revisionism and dogmatism. Mao Zedong Thought is the guiding principle for all work of the entire party, the entire army, and all people of the entire country." The poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres of the Red Star Brigade studied Vice Chairman Lin Biao's statements, recalling their history of breaking private interests and establishing public interests, growing continuously under the illumination of Mao Zedong Thought. They extensively studied, spoke, and applied Chairman Mao's works, praising Mao Zedong Thought as the sun, the rain, the steering wheel, and the lifeline of the revolutionary people; in the revolutionary criticism, they angrily criticized the Chinese Khrushchev and his henchmen's slanders against Mao Zedong Thought, accusing the active learning and application of Chairman Mao's works by workers, peasants, and soldiers as "simplification," "vulgarization," and "formalism." The broad poor and lower-middle peasants and active learners of Chairman Mao's works said with clear banners: Chairman Mao teaches us, "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." The small clique of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road, the more they oppose our learning Chairman Mao's works, the more we must actively learn and apply them, and we must learn them well and apply them actively! Currently, this brigade, in combination with the revolutionary criticism, has set up Mao Zedong Thought schools, and in the revolutionary criticism and breaking private interests and establishing public interests, has launched a new high tide of actively learning and applying Chairman Mao's works.

The revolutionary criticism of the Red Star Brigade has promoted the thought revolution of the broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, and the revolutionary and production situation is excellent. The entire brigade has had a bumper harvest of wheat and hemp this year, the autumn crops are growing well, and the projects and labor input for farmland construction have doubled, with remarkable achievements.

    红星大队结合本地阶级斗争史开展专题大批判
    忆苦——狠批中国赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义
    思甜——永跟毛主席坚决走社会主义道路
    据新华社哈尔滨二十四日电　黑龙江省巴彦县永发公社红星大队广大贫下中农和革命干部，活学活用毛主席著作，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想作武器，结合亲身感受的事实，对准中国赫鲁晓夫的反动谬论，展开革命的大批判，把革命的大批判和本地区的斗批改推进到一个新的水平，同时热烈颂扬伟大领袖毛主席和光焰无际的毛泽东思想，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动推向了新的高潮，促进了人的思想革命化，巩固了革命的大联合。
    忆苦思甜，狠批“剥削有功”论；颂扬伟大领袖毛主席，永远跟着毛主席闹革命
    毛主席教导我们说：“在阶级斗争的社会里，有了剥削阶级剥削劳动人民的自由，就没有劳动人民不受剥削的自由。”
    红星大队的革命大批判运动，就是遵照毛主席的这一教导，从忆苦思甜入手的。他们针对中国赫鲁晓夫所极力鼓吹的“剥削有功”、劳动人民“欢迎剥削”等反动谬论，以贫下中农为主力军，以红色造反者和民兵为骨干，广泛、深入地开展了忆苦思甜活动，激发起广大革命群众的无产阶级革命感情，愤怒批判中国赫鲁晓夫和他在黑龙江的爪牙；热烈颂扬伟大领袖毛主席的丰功伟绩。忆苦思甜搞得越好，专题大批判就搞得越深。每一次忆苦，都是“一苦引出千家仇，一冤激起万家恨”；每一次思甜，都激起广大贫下中农对毛主席更加无限热爱。
    在第二生产队举行的忆苦思甜，狠批“剥削有功”论的群众大会上，老贫农魏广有含泪控诉了在旧社会地主、资本家残害他一家的血泪斑斑的阶级苦。当场六十多人都禁不住流下了仇恨的泪水，台上台下一齐愤怒地高呼：“不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇！”“剥削有罪，罪该万死！”“打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫！”当魏广有讲到是毛主席他老人家把他一家人从火坑里救了出来，使流离失所的弟兄三个得到团聚，翻身做了主人的时候，全场的人一次又一次地振臂高呼：“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    人们忆过去，看今天，无比憎恨中国的赫鲁晓夫，无比憎恨资本主义；无限热爱毛主席，无限热爱社会主义。老贫农王树仁说：旧社会，就是地主、资本家吃劳动人民肉，喝劳动人民血的社会。地主、资本家的剥削不仅有罪，而且罪大恶极，谁要说“剥削无罪”，“剥削有功”，我豁出老命来也要和他拚到底！一些贫下中农出身的青年人，也在会上表示要不忘本，不忘阶级苦，牢记血泪仇，永远不上阶级敌人的当，紧跟毛主席，永远闹革命。
    忆阶级斗争史，狠批“阶级斗争熄灭论”；颂扬无产阶级专政，誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线
    毛主席教导我们说：“帝国主义者和国内反动派决不甘心于他们的失败，他们还要作最后的挣扎。在全国平定以后，他们也还会以各种方式从事破坏和捣乱，他们将每日每时企图在中国复辟。”
    红星大队的广大贫下中农和革命干部，在运用毛主席的这一教导，狠批中国赫鲁晓夫的“阶级斗争熄灭论”时，联系了本地、本村的阶级斗争史。毛主席的英明论断和本地、本村尖锐复杂的阶级斗争的事实，使广大贫下中农和革命干部深切地认识到，中国的赫鲁晓夫鼓吹“阶级斗争熄灭论”，就是为他和他的一伙以及地、富、反、坏、右妄图颠覆无产阶级专政、复辟资本主义服务的。事实上阶级敌人复辟和无产阶级反复辟的斗争一直存在着。
    在专题大批判一开始，这个大队的贫下中农和革命干部就一段一段地回忆解放十八年来本地本村两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的历史。经过群众回忆，摆出了本地本村阶级敌人阴谋篡夺政权、复辟资本主义的大量罪恶事实。这个村的地、富、反、坏分子，在土改斗争时，他们写下变天账，一有风吹草动，就蠢蠢欲动；合作化时，他们毒害耕畜，企图搞垮合作社；人民公社化时，他们大造“公社不如合作社好，合作社不如互助组好，互助组不如单干好”的反革命舆论，企图复辟资本主义；在蒋匪帮叫嚣窜犯大陆时，他们查地边，验地界，阴谋反攻倒算；在遭受了严重自然灾害的三年暂时困难时期，他们拉出去，打进来，阴谋篡夺政权；在无产阶级文化大革命中，他们篡夺文化大革命的领导权，推行资产阶级反动路线，打击陷害“四清”运动中的积极分子，大搞翻案活动。
    这些尖锐复杂的阶级斗争，使大家触目惊心。
    贫农社员郭建有说：中国的赫鲁晓夫鼓吹什么“阶级斗争熄灭论”，这纯粹是骗人，是给以中国的赫鲁晓夫为总代表的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派以及地、富、反、坏、右企图复辟资本主义，变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政打掩护。阶级敌人一天也没有老实过。他们表面老实，笑里藏刀，他们人还在，心不死，我们千万不能上中国赫鲁晓夫的当，“务必不要松懈自己的警惕性”。老贫农顾长恩说：我们要是听信了中国的赫鲁晓夫的鬼话，那可真是脑袋掉了都不知道怎么掉的。我们一定要牢记毛主席他老人家的教导，念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，誓死捍卫毛主席的革命路线，牢牢掌握印把子，让社会主义铁打江山，千秋万代永不变色。
    对中国赫鲁晓夫的大批判，增进了革命群众之间的无产阶级感情，促进了革命的大联合。有的队，过去两派革命群众没有解决的思想疙瘩，在这次大批判中，经过两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的回忆对比，认准了共同的大敌，消除了隔阂，增强了团结，矛头齐指中国的赫鲁晓夫。
    忆集体化史，狠批“四大自由”、“三自一包”；颂扬社会主义，坚决走社会主义道路
    毛主席教导我们说：“当人民推翻了帝国主义、封建主义和官僚资本主义的统治之后，中国要向那里去？向资本主义，还是向社会主义？……事实已经回答了这个问题：只有社会主义能够救中国。”
    红星大队的广大贫下中农和革命干部遵照毛主席的这一伟大教导，从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底批倒斗臭中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙所鼓吹的“四大自由”、“三自一包”等反动谬论。在专题的革命大批判中，他们紧紧抓住了忆集体化史这一中心环节，广泛发动群众回忆和总结从互助组到人民公社步步登高的集体化史和两条道路斗争史。广大贫下中农从回忆对比中更加热爱社会主义，更加无限热爱毛主席，恨死了企图复辟资本主义的中国的赫鲁晓夫。
    第二生产队的贫下中农在大批判中回忆了本队集体化前后的情况：土改后、合作化前的一段时间，全队二十几户贫下中农当中有三户卖掉了土地，有十五户又重新遭受高利贷盘剥。贫下中农社员又回忆了前些年，在中国赫鲁晓夫的鼓吹下，农村中出现“单干风”，资本主义势力猖獗一时的情况。这些铁的事实，使社员们擦亮了眼睛，激起仇恨，他们同声痛斥中国的赫鲁晓夫和本省一小撮反革命修正主义分子鼓吹“四大自由”、“三自一包”的罪行。他们说：“四大自由”、“三自一包”，和旧社会农民头上“三把刀”（地租、高利贷、苛捐杂税）是一路货色。就是让我们走回头路，受二遍苦，重新当牛马。我们一千个不答应！一万个不答应！他们回忆到全大队在互助组时，只有三匹马、一头牛、一副犁、一台破铁车，而今天已经发展到三十五匹马、四台大胶车，粮食亩产量由一百多斤增长到三百多斤。社员们同声齐赞社会主义好，同声欢呼人民公社好。贫农李贵说：只有走毛主席他老人家给我们指出的社会主义道路，才是通向共产主义的光明大道，才能永远不走回头路，不受二遍苦。
    这样，边忆、边批、边颂扬，不仅使广大社员进一步看清中国赫鲁晓夫的丑恶面目，受了两条道路斗争的教育，而且进一步提高了社员的社会主义觉悟。广大社员决心破私立公，把人民公社集体经济办得更好，给中国的赫鲁晓夫当头一棒。
    忆个人成长史，狠批那些诋毁毛泽东思想的无耻谰言；颂扬战无不胜的毛泽东思想，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗
    林彪副主席说：“毛泽东思想是在帝国主义走向全面崩溃，社会主义走向全世界胜利的时代的马克思列宁主义。毛泽东思想是反对帝国主义的强大的思想武器，是反对修正主义和教条主义的强大的思想武器。毛泽东思想是全党、全军和全国一切工作的指导方针。”红星大队的贫下中农和革命干部学习林彪副主席的论述，回忆在毛泽东思想光辉照耀下，破私立公，不断成长的历史，大学大讲大用毛主席著作，颂扬毛泽东思想是阳光，是雨露，是方向盘，是革命人民的命根子；在革命的大批判中，愤怒地批判了中国赫鲁晓夫及其爪牙诋毁毛泽东思想，诬蔑工农兵活学活用毛主席著作是“简单化”、“庸俗化”、“形式主义”等的无耻谰言。广大贫下中农和活学活用毛主席著作积极分子旗帜鲜明地说：毛主席教导我们，“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，越是反对我们学习毛主席著作，我们越是要活学活用，非得学好用活不可！目前，这个大队结合革命的大批判，大办毛泽东思想大学校，在革命的大批判中，在破私立公中，掀起了活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮。
    红星大队的革命的大批判促进了广大革命群众、革命干部的思想革命化，革命、生产形势一片大好。全大队今年麦、麻普遍丰收，大秋作物长势喜人，农田基本建设项目和投工量倍增，成绩显著。
