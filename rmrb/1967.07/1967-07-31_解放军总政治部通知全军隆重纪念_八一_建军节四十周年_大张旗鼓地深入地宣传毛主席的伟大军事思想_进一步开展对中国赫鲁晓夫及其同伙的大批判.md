The General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army today issued a notice instructing the entire army to solemnly commemorate the 40th anniversary of the founding of the army on August 1st. The notice states that this year's Army Day should be linked with the current international class struggle situation, with our country's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and with the ongoing criticism of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. It should be a grand and in-depth propaganda campaign for Chairman Mao's great military thought.

The notice points out that Chairman Mao's military thought is the most complete, most scientific, and most great military theory in the history of the development of Marxism, and it is the highest peak of contemporary Marxism-Leninism military theory. It is a powerful weapon for all revolutionary peoples of the world to strive for the liberation of oppressed nations and oppressed classes, and to smash all reactionary forces.

The notice requires the entire army to vigorously propagate Chairman Mao's military thought and to seriously organize commemorative activities. Through this commemorative activity, further criticize the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, launch a new high tide of learning and applying Chairman Mao's works, promote the current support-the-army-and-love-the-people activities, further strengthen the relationship between the People's Liberation Army and the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses, resolutely carry out and complete the great historical tasks of "supporting the left," "military control," and "military support," and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end; resolutely strive to defend the motherland, liberate Taiwan, and support the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world.

The General Political Department's notice proposes several commemorative measures, including organizing all personnel to seriously study Chairman Mao's quotations on people's war and Vice Chairman Lin Biao's article "Long Live the Victory of People's War," as well as important editorials and articles published in *Red Flag*, *People's Daily*, and *PLA Daily*. Thoroughly criticize the reactionary bourgeois military line of anti-Party elements such as Peng Dehuai and Luo Ruiqing, and specially emphasize Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This education should be an important part of the current two-line struggle education in the troops. Each unit (dispersed units at the battalion level) should hold commemorative meetings or reports. Each unit and the cadres and fighters responsible for "supporting the left," "military control," and "military support" should, through reports, discussions, and military-civilian celebrations, propagate to the people and militias. At the same time, invite local revolutionary young people and revolutionary cadres to give reports to the troops, further and more deeply carry out support-the-army-and-love-the-people activities. Various professional art troupes and amateur performance teams should go deep into the companies, factories, rural areas, schools, and streets to carry out propaganda performances.
