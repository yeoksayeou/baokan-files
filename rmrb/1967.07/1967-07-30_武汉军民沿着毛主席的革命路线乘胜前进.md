On both banks of the Yangtze River, in cities and villages, battlefields have been set up everywhere, with all forces concentrated on pursuing and attacking the fleeing enemy.

Under the guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan area is entering a new stage of victory. The broad ranks of officers and soldiers from the People's Liberation Army's land, sea, and air forces stationed in Wuhan are fighting shoulder to shoulder with the proletarian revolutionary masses. Following Chairman Mao's brilliant instruction to "exploit the remaining courage to pursue the fleeing enemy," they are advancing in victory, concentrating all their efforts to pursue and attack China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan area, determined to thoroughly settle accounts with the crimes of this small handful of class enemies.

The proletarian revolutionary masses, who become more courageous, stronger, and wiser with each battle, are marching towards new victories more closely united; the deceived masses are returning to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line in batches and joining the fight. On both banks of the Yangtze River, in cities and villages, battlefields have been set up everywhere to severely punish China's Khrushchev and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army in the Wuhan area. The ranks of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Wuhan area have never been as vast as they are today, and the firepower to punish the "falling dogs" has never been as fierce as it is today. The handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army in the Wuhan area have been thoroughly isolated and are submerged in the vast sea of angry denunciations by the revolutionary army and people.

In the new high tide of great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle, the proletarian revolutionary masses in the Wuhan area are rapidly and closely uniting and combining their forces, breaking waves and advancing from victory to new victory. They regard strengthening the unity of the proletarian revolutionary masses as a revolutionary need, a need for struggle, and a guarantee of victory. They firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, concentrate their targets, and concentrate their firepower, directing the spearhead of the struggle against China's Khrushchev, against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army, and against the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes Army" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line. The proletarian revolutionary fighters say, although we have achieved great victories, the tasks of struggle facing us are still heavy; although the class enemies are isolated, they will not readily accept their defeat and will struggle desperately, attempting to make a comeback. In the face of a great enemy, we proletarian revolutionaries must further strengthen our unity, form a powerful iron fist, and unite against the enemy. We will resolutely not say anything that is not conducive to great unity and great alliance; we will resolutely not do anything that is not conducive to great unity and great alliance. We will devote all our energy to severely fighting against the "small handful" and launching a new high tide of revolutionary criticism.

In recent days, in the three towns of Wuhan, mass rallies, denunciation meetings, criticism meetings, and demonstrations have been held continuously with the participation of tens of millions of proletarian revolutionaries and the Wuhan garrison.

The proletarian revolutionary masses in factories are severely fighting against the "small handful," deeply exposing and denouncing the heinous crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army in the Wuhan area, and expressing their determination to thoroughly implement Chairman Mao's great policy of "grasp revolution, promote production." Today, the proletarian revolutionary masses of the Yangtze River sailors held a grand water parade, angrily denouncing the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army in the Wuhan area, and expressing their determination to respond to Chairman Mao's great call, vowing to be models of "grasp revolution, promote production." The surging waters of the Yangtze River have become the battlefield for pursuing and attacking the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army in the Wuhan area.

Today, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in the suburbs of Wuhan held a grand rally and parade. With hearts full of excitement, they swore to the most beloved great leader Chairman Mao: firmly unite with the broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, overthrow China's Khrushchev, and overthrow the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army. Representatives from the proletarian revolutionary masses of Wuhan City and the Wuhan garrison also participated in this rally and parade.

The proletarian revolutionary masses in provincial and municipal organs also held a solemn rally today. Nearly ten thousand revolutionary cadres from provincial and municipal organs, spirited and full of fighting spirit, enthusiastically shouted: "Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!" "Long live Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand ten thousand years!" They exposed and denounced in the meeting with a large number of ironclad facts the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan area, and unanimously expressed their determination to advance in victory, launch a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, and resolutely fight down, overthrow, and expose China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan area, not resting until complete victory is achieved!

The day the deceived masses awaken is the day the "small handful" is thoroughly finished. In the great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle, the proletarian revolutionary masses in the Wuhan area regard educating and winning over the deceived masses to join the revolution as a very important task. Some of the masses who were deceived and joined the "Million Heroes Army" are awakening under the wise policy of the great leader Chairman Mao and the enthusiastic help of the proletarian revolutionary masses, and are rising up to turn their backs on the revolution. They return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and quickly join the great battle of great exposure, great criticism, and great struggle with fierce firepower. The revolutionary mass organizations of the Provincial Party Committee and the Provincial People's Committee recently held a special meeting to help the deceived cadres quickly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They organized them to study Chairman Mao's works, using Mao Zedong Thought to brighten their eyes, making them realize that they stood on the wrong side in the fierce class struggle and began to awaken and join the revolution. Many factories, organs, and schools have some deceived cadres and masses who have resolutely returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They are exposing and denouncing China's Khrushchev and the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party and the army in the Wuhan area, as well as the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes Army" who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, together with the proletarian revolutionary masses in the Wuhan area.

The officers and soldiers fighting on the front line of "three supports, two militaries" have been holding meetings, parades, discussions, and seminars with the proletarian revolutionary masses in recent days, reaching a new high tide in denouncing China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan. The barracks and the areas around the barracks are all battlefields for sweeping away demons. The situation of revolutionary criticism is getting better and better. In recent days, many officers and soldiers have also invited proletarian revolutionary fighters and leaders to give reports to the cadres and soldiers, introducing their struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. The broad proletarian revolutionary masses and the officers and soldiers of the Wuhan garrison are more closely united, establishing deeper class feelings in the struggle. The cadres and soldiers most resolutely express to the proletarian revolutionary masses that in future struggles, no matter what difficulties and twists and turns appear, we will firmly, clearly, and unambiguously support the genuine proletarian revolutionary masses wholeheartedly, forever unite with the proletarian revolutionary masses heart to heart and shoulder to shoulder, advance in victory along Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and advance forever!

    大江两岸、城镇乡村，处处摆开战场，集中全力穷追猛打落水狗
    武汉军民沿着毛主席的革命路线乘胜前进
    连日来，武汉三镇每天都有数十万革命群众、解放军指战员联合举行誓师大会、声讨大会、批判大会和游行示威，向中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉的代理人和“百万雄师”中一小撮坏头头猛烈开火
    新华社武汉二十九日电　在伟大统帅毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的指引下，武汉地区的无产阶级文化大革命正在进入一个新的胜利阶段。人民解放军驻武汉陆海空三军中紧紧地同无产阶级革命派并肩战斗的广大指战员和广大的无产阶级革命派战士，遵循毛主席“宜将剩勇追穷寇”的光辉教导，乘胜前进，集中全力穷追猛打中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人，决心彻底清算这一小撮阶级敌人的滔天罪行。
    愈战愈勇、愈战愈强、愈战愈有智慧的无产阶级革命派，更紧密地团结起来向新的胜利进军了；受蒙蔽的群众一批又一批地回到毛主席的革命路线上来，反戈战斗了。大江两岸、城镇乡村，处处都摆开了痛打中国的赫鲁晓夫、痛打武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的战场。武汉地区无产阶级文化大革命的队伍从来没有象今天这样浩浩荡荡，痛打“落水狗”的火力从来没有象今天这样猛烈。武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派已经彻底孤立，陷入广大革命军民愤怒声讨的汪洋大海之中。
    在革命的大揭发、大批判、大斗争的新高潮中，武汉地区的无产阶级革命派，正在迅速地、紧密地团结起来，联合起来，乘风破浪，从胜利走向新的胜利。他们把加强无产阶级革命派内部的团结，看作是革命的需要，斗争的需要，胜利的保证。他们紧紧掌握斗争大方向，集中目标，集中火力，把斗争矛头对准中国的赫鲁晓夫，对准党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对准武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，对准“百万雄师”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头。无产阶级革命派战士们说，我们虽然已经取得了很大胜利，但是，摆在我们面前的战斗任务还很重；阶级敌人虽然孤立了，但是他们是决不会甘心自己的失败的，他们还要作垂死的挣扎，妄图卷土重来。大敌当前，我们无产阶级革命派必须进一步加强团结，拧成一个强有力的铁拳头，一致对敌。凡是不利于大团结、大联合的话，我们坚决不说；凡是不利于大团结、大联合的事，我们坚决不做。我们要把全部精力，都用到狠斗“一小撮”，兴起革命大批判的新高潮。
    连日来，在武汉三镇，连续举行了有数十万无产阶级革命派和武汉驻军参加的誓师大会、声讨大会、批判大会和游行示威。
    工厂的无产阶级革命派，狠斗“一小撮”，深入地揭发和控诉武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行，并表示坚决贯彻执行毛主席的“抓革命，促生产”的伟大方针。长江海员无产阶级革命派今天举行声势浩大的水上游行，愤怒声讨武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，并表示坚决响应毛主席的伟大号召，誓当“抓革命，促生产”的模范。波涛滚滚的长江水面，成了乘胜追击武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的战场。
    今天，武汉郊区的广大贫下中农举行了盛大集会和游行。他们怀着万分激动的心情，向最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席宣誓：坚决和解放军广大指战员团结在一起，打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫，打倒党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。武汉市的无产阶级革命派和武汉驻军，都派代表参加了这个大会和游行。
    省市机关无产阶级革命派今天也举行了隆重的誓师大会。近万名省市机关的革命干部，精神抖擞，斗志昂扬，热烈欢呼：“毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！”“毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”他们在会上以大量铁的事实，愤怒揭发和控诉了中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区代理人的滔天罪行，并一致表示，乘胜前进，掀起革命大批判的新高潮，坚决把中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，不获全胜，决不收兵！
    受蒙蔽群众觉醒之日，即“一小撮”彻底完蛋之时。在大揭发、大批判、大斗争中，武汉地区无产阶级革命派，把教育、争取受蒙蔽的群众起来革命，作为一项极其重要的任务。一些受欺骗、受蒙蔽参加了“百万雄师”的群众，在伟大领袖毛主席英明政策的感召下，在无产阶级革命派的热情帮助下，纷纷起来回戈造反。他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来，很快就以猛烈的火力投入了大揭发、大批判、大斗争的伟大战斗。省委、省人委的革命群众组织为了帮助受蒙蔽的干部迅速回到毛主席的革命路线上来，最近专门开会，组织他们学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想擦亮他们的眼睛，使他们认识到自己在激烈的阶级斗争中站错了队，开始觉悟过来，起来革命。许多工厂、机关、学校一些受蒙蔽的干部和群众，已毅然回到了毛主席的革命路线一边来。他们纷纷与武汉地区无产阶级革命派一起，同台揭发、控诉中国的赫鲁晓夫和武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，以及“百万雄师”中坚持资产阶级反动路线的一小撮坏头头。
    战斗在“三支”、“两军”第一线的指战员，这几天，和无产阶级革命派一起集会、游行，讨论座谈，使声讨中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉的代理人的活动，达到了新的高潮。部队驻地，营房内外，到处都是横扫群魔的战场。革命的大批判的形势越来越好。这几天，许多部队指战员还纷纷请无产阶级革命派战士和负责人向干部战士作报告，介绍他们同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗争的事迹。广大无产阶级革命派和武汉驻军指战员团结得更紧了，在斗争中建立了更加深厚的阶级感情。干部、战士最坚决地向无产阶级革命派表示，在今后的斗争中，无论出现什么样的艰难险阻和曲折反复，我们永远坚定不移地、旗帜鲜明地、毫不含糊地、全心全意地支持真正的无产阶级革命派，永远和无产阶级革命派心连心，肩并肩，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线乘胜前进，永远前进！
