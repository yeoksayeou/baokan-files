Editor's Note: Chairman Mao teaches us: We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks onto the track of the proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

As the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution deepens, in some revolutionary mass organizations, especially among certain leaders, anarchist, individualist, subjective, factionalist, and mountain-head ideologies and work styles of the bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie have emerged. These disrupt Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and affect the overall direction of the struggle.

Overcoming these erroneous ideas is an important issue facing the proletarian revolutionary masses today. To overcome petty-bourgeois ideology and guide it onto the track of the proletarian revolution, the most effective method is to conduct rectification and earnestly carry out criticism and self-criticism, arming our minds with Mao Zedong Thought. Only in this way can our ranks truly become a highly proletarianized and highly combat-ready revolutionary army, and only in this way can we achieve a thorough victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Overcoming Bad Work Styles

Shanghai Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters Wáng Hóngwén

After a year of the Cultural Revolution, we Shanghai workers' revolutionary rebels have taken power. The change in political status has brought about two situations in our ranks: most comrades can use Mao Zedong Thought as a guide, constantly transform their worldview, raise their ideological awareness, and maintain close ties with the masses. However, some comrades' work styles have changed.

Some comrades have developed a sense of arrogance, considering themselves leftists, unwilling to listen to the masses' opinions, especially unwilling to listen to differing opinions. They often label others as "countercurrent," "old conservatives rebelling," or "counter-revolutionary seizure of power." Some comrades cling to their own "mountainheads," saying, "I am in power, even the great alliance must listen to me." Some comrades cannot identify cadres according to Chairman Mao's cadre policy but use their personal likes and dislikes as the standard for whether to combine with them. Some people have serious anarchist tendencies, rejecting proletarian organization and discipline, doing as they please.

The existence of these bad tendencies disrupts the revolutionary great alliance and the "three-in-one combination," affects the deepening of the great criticism, hinders the revolution, promotes production, and weakens and damages the combat effectiveness of the revolutionary organization.

To be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we must firmly grasp the transformation of our worldview. Chairman Mao said: "The transformation of worldview is a fundamental transformation." We must not think that revolutionary rebels taking power means we have established a proletarian worldview and have no task of transforming our thoughts. On the contrary, the change in political status puts higher demands on our ideological transformation. Because in the past, when we were not in power, the impact of mistakes was smaller. Now that we are in power, if we do not pay attention to transforming the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts in our minds, they will stubbornly manifest themselves, disrupting the proletarian revolutionary line. Chairman Mao teaches us: We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology in our ranks onto the track of the proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, firmly grasp the transformation of our worldview, thoroughly criticize the bourgeois worldview, and establish the proletarian worldview, firmly establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds.

Conducting rectification and carrying out criticism and self-criticism is an effective method for transforming our worldview. Chairman Mao said: "We have the weapon of criticism and self-criticism of Marxism-Leninism. We can eliminate bad work styles and maintain good work styles." The view that everything one does is perfect and correct, and that there is no need for criticism and self-criticism, is wrong and violates the epistemology of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

We proletarian revolutionaries have done many good things and made contributions in this Cultural Revolution. However, we must not consider ourselves leftists, put on airs, speak in official tones, or become arrogant. We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings: "Modesty makes one progress, arrogance makes one fall behind." The reason we have seized power from a handful of power-holders within the party who are taking the capitalist road is not because of any one person or a few people, nor is it because of fists and clubs, but because of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the broad revolutionary masses armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Similarly, after taking power, we should be humble and prudent, guard against arrogance and impatience, listen humbly to the masses' opinions, accept the masses' criticism, and forever be the masses' students. Only in this way can we constantly eliminate the political microbes attached to us, gain the support of the broad masses, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. If our comrades are careless on this issue, become detached from the masses, and even suppress the masses, it will develop into a mistake in direction and line.

Of course, mutual criticism within the revolutionary ranks should be well-intentioned, gentle, and based on the desire for unity first. Chairman Mao pointed out: "People's shortcomings need to be criticized, but one must truly stand on the people's side, speaking with the fervent desire to protect and educate the people. If one treats comrades as enemies, one is standing on the enemy's side." We firmly oppose personal attacks, quarreling, venting personal grievances, and seeking revenge; we also oppose the practice of criticizing without distinguishing right from wrong, main from secondary, and knocking the other party down with one blow. Because this only makes friends suffer and enemies rejoice.

The year's struggle practice has made us deeply realize: as long as we adhere to Mao Zedong Thought as the banner, firmly stand on Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we will achieve victory and make rapid progress; as long as we deviate slightly from Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, we will make mistakes and suffer setbacks and failures. We proletarian revolutionaries must follow Chairman Mao closely, strive to study Chairman Mao's works, arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought, and constantly struggle against the bourgeois and petty-bourgeois thoughts in our minds. We will build our ranks into a force that holds high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, with high revolutionary spirit, scientific nature, and organizational discipline.

### 整掉不良的作风

    编者按：毛主席教导我们：必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。
    随着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，在一些革命群众组织中，特别是某些负责人身上存在的无政府主义、个人主义、主观主义、小团体主义、山头主义等等资产阶级和小资产阶级的思想作风就暴露出来了。它干扰毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，影响斗争的大方向。
    克服这些错误思想，是当前无产阶级革命派面临着的一个重要问题。要克服小资产阶级思想，把它引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，最有效的方法，就是通过整风认真地开展批评和自我批评，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。这样，我们的队伍才能真正成为非常无产阶级化、非常战斗化的革命大军，才能取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利。
    整掉不良的作风
    上海工人造反总司令部　王洪文
    经过一年来的文化大革命，我们上海工人革命造反派已经处于掌权的地位。政治地位的变化，在我们队伍中出现了两种情况：大多数同志能够以毛泽东思想为指针，不断地改造世界观，提高思想觉悟，密切联系群众。但是，也有些同志的思想作风起了一些变化。
    有的同志滋长了骄傲情绪，以左派自居，不善于听取群众的意见，特别是听不进不同意见。动不动就给别人扣上“逆流”、“老保翻天”、“反夺权”的帽子。有的同志抱住自己的“山头”不放，说什么“我是掌权的，大联合也得听我的”。有的同志不能按照毛主席的干部政策来识别干部，而是以对自己的“好”、“恶”来作为是否能结合的标准。有的人存在着严重的无政府主义，不要无产阶级的组织、纪律，为所欲为。
    这些不良倾向的存在，干扰了革命的大联合和“三结合”，影响大批判的深入开展，妨碍抓革命，促生产，削弱和损伤了革命组织的战斗力。
    我们要忠于毛主席的革命路线，必须狠抓世界观的改造。毛主席说：“世界观的转变是一个根本的转变”。我们绝不能认为革命造反派掌了权，就已经确立了无产阶级世界观，就没有改造思想的任务了。恰恰相反，政治地位改变了，对我们的思想改造提出了更高的要求。因为过去不当权，有了错误影响还小一点。现在当权了，如果不注意改造头脑里的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，它就会顽强地表现出来，干扰无产阶级革命路线。毛主席教导我们：必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。我们必须牢牢记住毛主席的教导，狠抓世界观的改造，大破资产阶级世界观，大立无产阶级世界观，在头脑里树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。
    进行整风，开展批评和自我批评，是改造世界观行之有效的方法。毛主席说：“我们有批评和自我批评这个马克思列宁主义的武器。我们能够去掉不良作风，保持优良作风。”那种认为自己的一切都是完美的、正确的，用不着开展批评和自我批评的观点是错误的，是违反马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的认识论的。
    我们无产阶级革命派，在这次文化大革命中办了很多好事，作出了贡献。但是，我们决不能以左派自居，摆起架子，打起官腔，骄傲起来。要牢牢记住毛主席的教导：“虚心使人进步，骄傲使人落后”。我们之所以能从党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派手中夺了权，并不是靠哪一个人或哪几个人，也不是靠拳头和棍子，而是靠战无不胜的毛泽东思想，靠用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大革命群众。同样，我们掌权以后，也应该谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，虚心倾听群众的意见，接受群众的批评，永远当群众的小学生。只有这样，我们才能不断地去掉沾染在身上的政治微生物，才能得到广大群众拥护，才能永远忠于毛主席的革命路线。如果我们的同志，在这个问题上掉以轻心，脱离群众，甚至反过来压制群众，发展下去，就会犯方向路线的错误。
    当然，革命派内部的互相批评，应该是善意的，和风细雨的，是首先从团结的愿望出发的。毛主席指出：“对于人民的缺点是需要批评的，……但必须是真正站在人民的立场上，用保护人民、教育人民的满腔热情来说话。如果把同志当作敌人来对待，就是使自己站在敌人的立场上去了。”我们坚决反对个人攻击，闹意气，泄私愤，图报复；也反对一批评，就不分青红皂白，不分主流支流，而把对方一棍子打倒的做法。因为这样做，只能使亲者痛，仇者快。
    一年来斗争的实践，使我们深深体会到：坚持毛泽东思想挂帅，坚定地站在毛主席的革命路线上，我们就取得胜利，就能飞快地前进；只要我们稍微离开毛泽东思想，离开毛主席的革命路线，就会犯错误，就要遭到挫折和失败。我们无产阶级革命派，要紧跟毛主席，就要努力学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，不断地向我们头脑里的资产阶级思想、小资产阶级思想，进行斗争。把我们的队伍建设成一支高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，具有高度革命性、科学性和组织纪律性的队伍。
