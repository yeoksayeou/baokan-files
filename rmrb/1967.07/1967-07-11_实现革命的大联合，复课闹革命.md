We from a certain unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army Navy, in response to Chairman Mao's call, arrived at Beijing No. 89 Middle School in March this year to assist with military training and participate in the work of resuming classes, reorganizing the leadership, establishing a "three-in-one" leadership body, and carrying out the struggle, criticism, and transformation. Upon entering the school, we first conducted investigations and research, thoroughly understanding the situation of the school's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and carried out extensive political and ideological work, helping them achieve revolutionary great unity, "three-in-one" combination, and resuming classes and making revolution.

Distinguishing between enemies and ourselves, grasping the direction of the struggle

In this school, due to the original Party branch and work team implementing the bourgeois reactionary line, the class lines were confused, the revolutionary faction was suppressed, and students were incited to fight against each other, causing serious rifts and antagonism between teachers and students, among teachers, and among students. Before we entered the school, revolutionary teachers and students had criticized the bourgeois reactionary line, but because they did not grasp the direction of the struggle, some who had been persecuted said, "Criticize whoever implemented the bourgeois reactionary line," "Where there is a boil, poke it there." Those who had implemented the bourgeois reactionary line were not convinced, with some saying, "Even if we made mistakes, we are better than them." This way, the more antagonistic the atmosphere became, the more they fought among themselves, while the enemy was left alone.

Facing this situation, we organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works such as "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society" and "On Practice." Chairman Mao taught us that who are our enemies and who are our friends? This is the primary question of the revolution and also the primary question of the cultural revolution. We must strictly distinguish and correctly handle two types of contradictions of different nature, unite our friends, and attack the real enemies.

On the basis of universal study and discussion, we went to the classes and had heart-to-heart talks with the broad masses of teachers and students. According to different individuals and different ideological conditions, we conducted patient and meticulous persuasion and education, making the persecuted teachers and students truly have the desire for unity, and those who had implemented the bourgeois reactionary line truly have the sincerity to reflect.

To further raise the class consciousness of teachers and students, deepen their understanding of the bourgeois reactionary line, and clarify the direction of the struggle, we organized teachers, students, and parents to expose, accuse, and criticize the crimes of the old society and the bourgeois reactionary line together. During the recollection and accusation sessions, everyone presented facts, listed crimes, discussed harm, found roots, and cleared their eyes, recognizing the essence of the bourgeois reactionary line. The bourgeois reactionary line aims to overthrow our proletarian dictatorship, implement the restoration of capitalism, and make us go back to the old path, suffering twice. Everyone linked the bourgeois reactionary line with the miserable life of the old society, linked old grievances with new hatred, and focused their hatred on the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Through a series of work, the broad revolutionary teachers and students recognized the enemy from themselves in their minds, realizing that the contradictions between the persecuted masses and the deceived masses are internal contradictions among the people, which should be correctly resolved according to Chairman Mao's teachings with the method of "unity-criticism-unity." Ignoring the enemy and fighting among themselves is wrong.

Once the direction of the struggle was clarified, the "internal war" stopped. A teacher, who was labeled as a "monster and demon" in the early stages of the movement for posting big-character posters against the original Party branch, had resentment towards the teachers and students who had surrounded and attacked him. Through class education, he said excitedly at the accusation meeting, "The teachers and students who surrounded me are also victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. We should join hands to attack the common enemy." A teacher who had participated in the suppression of revolutionary masses said painfully, "In the past, when I examined my mistakes, the higher the level, the bigger the hat, but my mind was not clear. Now my mind is clear, and I can't sit still without reflecting." Many deceived students also said, "The bourgeois reactionary line poisoned us, making us disunited and fighting 'internal war.' We hate the bourgeois reactionary line, and we hate the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road." They turned back and decisively broke with the bourgeois reactionary line, returning to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. With the same target, the rift was eliminated, thus laying the political foundation for achieving revolutionary great unity.

Breaking private interests and establishing public interests, achieving revolutionary great unity

Chairman Mao taught us: We must be good at guiding the petty-bourgeois ideology within our ranks to the track of the proletarian revolution. This is a key issue for the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Before we entered the school, this school had attempted several times to achieve great unity, but each time it failed, the root cause being the interference of private interests. Therefore, only by breaking private interests and establishing public interests, thoroughly criticizing bourgeois ideology, and firmly establishing proletarian ideology, can we firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, achieve revolutionary great unity, and promote the great criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit.

To break private interests and establish public interests, one must first dare to expose one's thoughts. At the beginning, many people were afraid to expose their thoughts for three reasons: fear of ugliness and pain, fear of being criticized for minor faults, and fear of being ridiculed. You fear, I fear, and everyone hides their thoughts. How can private interests be broken if they are not exposed? To make the masses dare to expose their thoughts, we set an example. One of our comrades, an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, specifically shared his various ideological activities since entering the school, introducing how he broke private interests and established public interests through studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. Other comrades from the PLA also shared their personal experiences of breaking private interests and promoting ideological transformation. When we exposed and clarified our thoughts, it had a significant impact on the teachers and students. They said, "The PLA has a bit of private interest, and they do not let it go, exposing it to the masses and fighting it openly. We should also follow the example of the PLA." The masses' concerns were dispelled, and they came forward to expose their thoughts. Some students said, "I just want to be a leader and am afraid that great unity will dissolve my fighting team, and I won't be able to be a leader." Some said, "I just love freedom and am afraid that great unity will restrict my freedom." Some said, "I just love to find faults with others, and if anyone opposes me, I will be against them." A teacher said, "I don't want to work in this school anymore, nor do I want to be a teacher. I am preparing to leave." Officials who had been persecuted by the bourgeois reactionary line also came forward to expose their thoughts.

We guided everyone to study and apply Chairman Mao's works to solve these ideological problems. The broad revolutionary teachers and students have an unparalleled love for Chairman Mao and listen to Chairman Mao's words the most. Chairman Mao said, "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every living person feel sad when thinking of them. Can we still not sacrifice our personal interests and abandon our mistakes?" The vast majority of students in this school are children of the working people. Chairman Mao's words aroused their class feelings, making them realize that all private thoughts are against the people's interests and are wrong. They expressed their determination to act according to Chairman Mao's instructions.

We also helped the students carry out the mass ideological mutual assistance activities of "one helps one" and "one pair of reds," guiding them to learn criticism and self-criticism and correctly handle internal contradictions among the people. Some students had been opposed to each other since the cultural revolution and did not speak to each other. After studying Chairman Mao's works, they conducted self-criticism, eliminated the rift, and turned from "enemies" into a pair of reds. They studied Chairman Mao's works together, criticized the bourgeois reactionary line together, had heart-to-heart talks, and did good deeds together. The "one helps one" and "one pair of reds" activities increased day by day. Based on the heart-to-heart and mutual assistance activities, Mao Zedong Thought study groups were developed. Such study groups are actually mass organizations for breaking private interests and promoting ideological transformation. When the masses have ideological problems, they propose them within the group and educate themselves. They use Mao Zedong Thought as a sharp weapon to sweep away various bourgeois and petty-bourgeois ideologies, clearing the ideological obstacles for achieving revolutionary great unity.

The revolutionary young warriors of Class One, Grade Three, achieved remarkable results in breaking private interests and establishing public interests, first achieving great unity in the entire class. We summarized their experience and promoted it throughout the school. By the end of April, the entire school achieved revolutionary great unity with the leftists as the core and the teaching classes as the foundation. Subsequently, the school-wide Red Guard organization "May 4 Corps" was established, and sub-units were set up in each teaching class. The unity of the classes promoted the unity of various revolutionary organizations; the unity of various revolutionary organizations consolidated the unity of the classes. On May 9, No. 89 Middle School achieved the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination and established the Revolutionary Committee.

Responding to Chairman Mao's call, resuming classes and making revolution

Based on the achievement of revolutionary great unity and "three-in-one" combination, the entire school's teachers and students were full of spirit, pushing the school's Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the new stage of resuming classes and making revolution.

How to resume classes and make revolution? The masses raised many questions. There was a sense of fear among the teachers, fearing that they would make mistakes in teaching and be criticized by the students; fearing that the students would not follow the rules and the classes could not be conducted. Many students wanted to go out and visit, and could not sit still. Some teachers and students were concerned about returning to the old ways, focusing on science, mathematics, and physics all day, leading to "resuming classes and opposing the revolution."

We believe that the ideological problems among teachers and students, in the end, are still due to insufficient understanding of the great significance of resuming classes and making revolution, insufficient understanding of the promotion of people's ideological transformation by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the failure to eliminate private thoughts. We repeatedly propagated the great significance of Chairman Mao's call to resume classes and make revolution, organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's related works and the "Opinions of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China on the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Middle Schools," corrected some vague understandings and wrong thoughts, making everyone realize that resuming classes and making revolution is to promote the great criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the unit. Resuming classes is to resume the class struggle, the cultural revolution, and Mao Zedong Thought. Once the ideological problems were solved and consciousness was raised, resuming classes and making revolution was carried out.

"The masses are the real heroes." Resuming classes and making revolution must rely on teachers and students themselves to create experiences in practice. The revolutionary teachers and students of Class Eight, Grade One, were the first to resume classes. They thoroughly criticized the old teaching methods, established new teacher-student relationships and class order, and turned the classroom into a battlefield for propagating Mao Zedong Thought. They closely linked the great criticism of the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of the school. The practice of Class Eight, Grade One, inspired the other classes, and the entire school quickly formed a wave of resuming classes and making revolution. Under the guidance of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the broad revolutionary teachers and students took up their pens as weapons, directing the spearhead of the struggle at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They exposed and criticized their implementation of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line and the cultivation of bourgeois successors. The teachers and students used their personal experiences to accuse the poisoning of the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line. For many years, the saying "divide, divide, the lifeline of students; examine, examine, the magic weapon of teachers" was popular among students; the textbooks were filled with feudalism, capitalism, and revisionism; Khrushchev's "Cultivation" was also included in the middle school textbooks, poisoning the youth. From the many shocking facts exposed, the broad revolutionary teachers and students received profound education on the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines.

Chairman Mao taught us: "Without destruction, there can be no construction; without blocking, there can be no flow; without stopping, there can be no progress." We thoroughly criticized bourgeois ideology and firmly established Mao Zedong Thought. In the past, the school organized this group and that group, but there was no group organized to study Chairman Mao's works; this model worker and that model worker were established, but there was no model worker established to study Chairman Mao's works. In the process of resuming classes and making revolution, the revolutionary teachers and students organized 97 Mao Zedong Thought study groups and commended the active learners of Chairman Mao's works. Many study groups strived to achieve four realizations in learning content, personnel, time, and effect. Some groups even planned weekly and arranged daily, exchanging experiences weekly. Many students arrived at school half an hour earlier every day, seizing the time to study more of Chairman Mao's works. Through study, the broad revolutionary teachers and students deepened their feelings for Chairman Mao's works, deepened their feelings for Mao Zedong Thought, and deepened their feelings for the great leader Chairman Mao.

The face of No. 89 Middle School changed, and people's spiritual outlook and interpersonal relationships underwent profound changes. The relationship between teachers and students gradually changed from the past mutual opposition to a new type of relationship where students respect teachers and teachers cherish students. The No. 89 Middle School, which was once enslaved and poisoned by revisionism, was reborn under the sun of Mao Zedong Thought, and a new generation is growing up healthily.

The work of resuming classes and making revolution has just begun, and there is still a lot of work to be done. We must definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, be vigilant against arrogance and impatience, carry forward our achievements, overcome our shortcomings, and strive for new victories!

    实现革命的大联合，复课闹革命
    中国人民解放军海军某部驻北京八十九中军训团
    我们海军某部响应毛主席的号召，于今年三月来到北京市第八十九中学，帮助实行军训，并且参预关于开学、整顿组织、建立三结合领导机关和实行斗批改的工作。进校后，我们首先从调查研究入手，深入细致地了解这个学校开展无产阶级文化大革命的情况，进行大量的政治思想工作，帮助他们实现了革命大联合、“三结合”和复课闹革命。
    分清敌我，掌握斗争大方向
    这个学校在无产阶级文化大革命中，由于原党支部、工作组执行了资产阶级反动路线，混淆阶级阵线，围剿革命派，挑动群众斗群众，造成了教师和学生、教师和教师、学生和学生之间的严重隔阂和对立。在我们进校前，革命师生也曾经批判过资产阶级反动路线，但由于没有掌握斗争大方向，一些受过迫害的师生提出：“谁执行了资产阶级反动路线就批判谁”，“那里有脓泡就往那里捅”。执行过资产阶级反动路线的师生则不服气，有的说：“我们就是犯错误也比他们强”。这样，越来对立情绪越严重，成天打“内战”，敌人却被放在一边。
    针对这种情况，我们组织大家学习毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》、《学习和时局》等著作。毛主席教导我们，谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题，也是文化大革命的首要问题。我们必须严格区分和正确处理两类不同性质的矛盾，团结我们的朋友，去攻击真正的敌人。
    在普遍学习和讨论的基础上，我们分头深入到班里，与广大师生展开谈心活动。根据不同对象，不同的思想状况，进行耐心细致的说服教育，使受迫害的师生真正有团结的愿望，执行过资产阶级反动路线的师生真正有检查的诚意。
    为了进一步提高师生的阶级觉悟，加深对资产阶级反动路线的认识，明确斗争的大方向，我们组织教师、学生和家长，一起揭发、控诉、批判旧社会和资产阶级反动路线的罪恶。在忆苦控诉中，大家摆事实，列罪状，论危害，挖根源，擦亮了眼睛，认清了资产阶级反动路线的实质。资产阶级反动路线就是要颠覆我们无产阶级专政，实行资本主义复辟，让我们走回头路，受二茬罪。大家把资产阶级反动路线和旧社会的悲惨生活联系起来，把旧仇和新恨联系起来，把仇恨集中到党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的身上。
    通过一系列工作，广大革命师生在思想上认清了敌我，认识到受迫害的群众和受蒙蔽的群众之间的矛盾，是人民内部矛盾，应当按照毛主席的教导，采取“团结——批评——团结”的方法，加以正确解决。放下敌人不管，互相打“内战”，这是错误的。
    斗争的大方向明确了，“内战”就停止了。有一位教师在运动初期，因给原党支部贴大字报，被打成牛鬼蛇神。过去他对受蒙蔽围攻过他的师生有怨气，通过阶级教育，他在控诉会上激动地说：“围攻我的老师和同学，也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。我们应该携起手来，去攻击共同的敌人。”一位曾参加围攻革命群众的教师沉痛地说：“从前我检查自己所犯的错误，上纲一次比一次高，帽子一次比一次大，但思想并没有通。现在思想通了，不检查就坐不住了。”许多受蒙蔽的同学也说：“资产阶级反动路线毒害了我们，使我们不团结，打‘内战’。我们恨透了资产阶级反动路线，恨透了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。”他们大杀回马枪，坚决和资产阶级反动路线决裂，回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。目标一致了，隔阂消除了，这样就为实现革命的大联合打下了政治基础。
    破私立公，实现革命的大联合
    毛主席教导我们：必须善于把我们队伍中的小资产阶级思想引导到无产阶级革命的轨道，这是无产阶级文化大革命取得胜利的一个关键问题。我们进校前，这个学校曾经搞过几次大联合，但每一次都失败了，根本原因就是私字作怪。因此，只有从思想上破私立公，大破资产阶级思想，大立无产阶级思想，才能紧紧掌握斗争大方向，实现革命的大联合，推动对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判和本单位的斗批改。
    破私立公，首先要大胆暴露思想。开始，不少群众对暴露思想有三怕，一怕丑怕痛，二怕抓小辫子，三怕讽刺挖苦。你也怕，我也怕，都把思想问题包藏起来。私心不露，怎么能破呢？为了使群众敢于亮思想，我们带头做出榜样。我们的一位同志，是学习毛主席著作积极分子，他向大家具体讲述了自己进校后的各种思想活动，介绍他怎样通过活学活用毛主席著作、不断破私立公的经验。其他解放军同志也介绍了自己破私立公、促进思想革命化的亲身体会。我们这样一亮一清，在师生中震动很大。他们说：“解放军有一点私心苗头，都不肯放过，都要拿到群众面前公开亮，公开斗。我们也要照解放军的样子去做。”群众的顾虑解除了，纷纷出来亮思想。有的同学说：“我就想当头头，就怕大联合把我的战斗队弄没了，我就当不成头头了。”有的说：“我就爱自由自在，怕大联合会束缚我的自由。”有的说：“我就爱抓别人的小辫子，谁要反对我，我就和他闹对立。”有的教师说：“我不想在这个学校干了，也不想当教师了，准备走了。”受过资产阶级反动路线迫害的干部，也出来亮了思想。
    我们针对这些活思想，引导大家活学活用毛主席著作，来解决这些思想问题。广大革命师生，对毛主席无比热爱，最听毛主席的话。毛主席说：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”这个学校的绝大部分学生都是劳动人民的子弟，毛主席的话唤起了他们的阶级感情，使他们认识到一切私心杂念都是违反人民利益的，都是错误的。他们表示，一定要按照毛主席的指示去做。
    我们又帮助学生开展一帮一、一对红的群众性的思想互助活动，引导他们学会批评与自我批评，正确处理人民内部矛盾。有的同学从文化大革命以来就互相对立，不说话。学了毛主席著作，他们进行了自我批评，消除了隔阂，由原来的“冤家”，变成了一对红。他们在一起学习毛主席著作，一起批判资产阶级反动路线，一起谈心，一起做好事。一帮一、一对红的活动一天天增多。在谈心互助活动的基础上，发展成为毛主席著作学习小组。这样的学习小组实际上是群众性的破私立公、思想革命化的战斗组。群众有了思想问题，就在小组内提出来，自己教育自己。他们运用毛泽东思想这个锐利的武器，横扫形形色色的资产阶级、小资产阶级思想，为实现革命大联合扫清了思想障碍。
    三年级一班的革命小将，在破私立公方面取得了显著成绩，首先实现了全班大联合。我们总结了他们的经验，在全校推广。四月底，全校实现了以左派为核心、以教学班为基础的革命大联合。接着，成立了全校性的红卫兵统一组织“五四”兵团，并在各教学班建立了分队。班级的联合，促进了各革命组织的联合；各革命组织的联合，又巩固了班级的联合。五月九日，八十九中实现了革命的“三结合”，成立了革命委员会。
    响应毛主席的号召，复课闹革命
    在实现革命大联合和“三结合”的基础上，全校师生意气风发，把学校的无产阶级文化大革命推进到复课闹革命的新阶段。
    复课闹革命怎么搞？群众提出了很多问题。教师中存在一种怕的情绪，怕讲课讲错了，学生揪住不放；怕学生不守纪律没法上课。不少学生总想到处走走，串串，坐不下来。有些师生担心回到过去那一套，成天数理化，造成“复课冲革命”。
    我们认为，教师和学生中的这些思想问题，归根到底，还是对复课闹革命的重大意义认识不足，对无产阶级文化大革命促进人们的思想革命化估计不够，在思想上还有私心杂念没有破除。我们反复向大家宣传毛主席号召复课闹革命的伟大意义，组织大家学习毛主席的有关著作和《中共中央关于中学无产阶级文化大革命的意见》等文件，纠正了一些模糊认识和错误思想，使大家认识到，复课闹革命，是推动对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判和本单位的斗批改相结合，复课就是复阶级斗争的课，复文化大革命的课，复毛泽东思想的课。思想问题解决了，觉悟提高了，复课闹革命也就搞起来了。
    “群众是真正的英雄”。复课闹革命，必须依靠教师和学生自己在实践中创造经验。一年级八班的革命师生首先开始复课，他们大破旧的教学方法，建立新的师生关系和教学秩序，把课堂变成宣传毛泽东思想的阵地。他们把对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判和学校的斗批改紧紧地结合起来。一年级八班的做法带动了各班，全校迅速形成了一个复课闹革命的热潮。广大革命师生在战无不胜的毛泽东思想指引下，拿起笔作刀枪，把斗争的矛头指向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。对他们推行反革命修正主义教育路线，培养资产阶级接班人的种种罪行进行揭发和批判。师生们用亲身的体会控诉反革命修正主义教育路线对自己的毒害。多年来，在学生中流行着“分、分，学生的命根；考、考，老师的法宝”；教材中充斥着封建主义、资本主义、修正主义的货色，中国赫鲁晓夫的《修养》也塞进了中学课文，毒害青年。从揭发出来的许多触目惊心的事实中，广大革命师生受到了两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的深刻教育。
    毛主席教导我们：“不破不立，不塞不流，不止不行”。我们大破资产阶级思想，大立毛泽东思想。过去学校里组织这个组，那个组，就是没有组织学习毛主席著作的组；树立这个标兵，那个标兵，就是没有树立学习毛主席著作的标兵。在复课闹革命中，革命师生组织了九十七个毛主席著作学习小组，表扬了学习毛主席著作的积极分子。不少学习小组努力做到学习内容、人员、时间、效果四落实。有的小组还做到周周有计划，天天有安排，一周一交流。许多同学每天提早半个钟头到校，抓紧时间多学点毛主席著作。经过学习，广大革命师生加深了对毛主席著作的感情，加深了对毛泽东思想的感情，加深了对伟大领袖毛主席的感情。
    八十九中的面貌改变了，人们的精神面貌和人与人的关系也起了深刻的变化。教师和学生，由过去那种互相对立的关系，逐渐转变成学生尊重老师、老师爱护学生的新型关系。曾被修正主义奴役和毒害的八十九中，在毛泽东思想阳光照耀下新生了，一代新人正在茁壮成长。
    复课闹革命刚刚开始，还有很多工作要做，我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，戒骄戒躁，发扬成绩，克服缺点，夺取新的胜利！
