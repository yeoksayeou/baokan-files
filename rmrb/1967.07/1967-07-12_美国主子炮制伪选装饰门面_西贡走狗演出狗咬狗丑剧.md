	Saigon—The puppet regime in Saigon is once again embroiled in internal strife as various factions vie for the "presidential" position, throwing the American plan to "stabilize" the political situation in South Vietnam into further disarray.

	The American aggressors, in an attempt to give the puppet regime a veneer of "democracy" to deceive the people of South Vietnam and global public opinion, concocted a fake "constitution" in March, stipulating that a "civilian government" would be established in South Vietnam within seven months and that a "presidential election" would be held on September 3. Various factions of the South Vietnamese puppets have long been eyeing this "presidential" seat. As the "election" date approaches, the contradictions within the puppet regime have become increasingly sharp. The fake "head of state" Nguyen Van Thieu and the fake "prime minister" Nguyen Cao Ky, both eager to become the "first president under the new constitution," have engaged in intense open and covert struggles. After Nguyen Cao Ky announced his intention to "run for president," Nguyen Van Thieu followed suit. Other declared candidates include the former fake "head of state" Phan Khac Suu and the former fake "prime minister" Tran Van Huong, while the exiled former puppet leader Nguyen Ngoc Tho has also expressed his desire to "return to the country to participate in the election." Thus, the conflict over the "presidential" seat has once again surfaced.

	According to reports, at a recent meeting of the fake "Armed Forces Council," the contradictions among the various factions further escalated. Nguyen Cao Ky faced strong opposition from several military region and army commanders.

	To prevent further infighting, the American bosses intervened in various ways, staging a "compromise" farce. Under pressure from both internal and external forces, Nguyen Cao Ky had to "concede," announcing that he would "withdraw from the presidential race" and instead run as a "vice-presidential candidate" alongside Nguyen Van Thieu in a "joint campaign."

    美国主子炮制伪选装饰门面
    西贡走狗演出狗咬狗丑剧
    据新华社讯　西贡消息：西贡傀儡集团群丑为争夺“总统”职位，内讧又一次表面化，使美国妄图“稳定”南越政局的计划又陷入新的困境中。
    美国侵略者为了给傀儡集团装饰一点“民主”的色彩，借以欺骗南越人民和世界舆论，在今年三月间炮制了一个假“宪法”，规定在七个月内将在南越成立“文官政府”，并订于九月三日举行“总统选举”。南越各派走狗对这个“总统”宝座都早已垂涎三尺。随着“选举”日期的临近，傀儡集团内部的矛盾日趋尖锐。伪“国家元首”阮文绍和伪“总理”阮高其，由于都想成为“新宪制下的第一任总统”，两个人之间的明争暗斗更是十分激烈。在阮高其宣布要“竞选总统”以后，阮文绍也接着宣布要参加“竞选”。另外宣布要参加“竞选”的还有被阮高其赶下台的前伪“国家元首”潘克丑和前伪“总理”陈文香，流亡在外的前傀儡头目杨文明也声称要“回国参加竞选”。这样，群狗争食的矛盾就又一次表面化了。
    据报道，在不久以前举行的伪“武装部队委员会”会议上，各派矛盾进一步激化。阮高其在会上遭到了一些军区和陆军头目的激烈反对。
    为了避免发生新的火并，美国主子进行了种种干预，导演了一幕“妥协”的丑剧。阮高其在内、外两面的压力下，不得不表示“让步”，宣布“放弃竞选总统”，而作为“副总统候选人”同阮文绍一起“联合竞选”。
