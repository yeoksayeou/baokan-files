New Delhi, July 22 (Xinhua) — Revolutionary people in Calcutta held a rally on July 18 to cheer the Nasalbari peasant armed struggle as the vanguard of the Indian democratic revolution.

The meeting was convened by the "Committee to Aid the Nasalbari Peasant Struggle" of the Revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India.

Speakers at the meeting enthusiastically praised the Nasalbari peasant armed struggle as the vanguard of the peasant revolution and democratic revolution. They pointed out that the Nasalbari peasant movement has greatly inspired the peasants of West Bengal.

The participants unanimously condemned the Indian reactionary government's bloody massacre of the rebellious peasants.

Speakers at the meeting also severely denounced a small clique of Indian Communist revisionist leaders for betraying the revolution and supporting the reactionary police in their bloody suppression of the rebellious peasants. They also strongly protested against the despicable act of the Indian Communist revisionist leaders in slandering a leader of the Nasalbari peasant movement as a "CIA agent."

The meeting demanded that the Indian reactionary government withdraw its police forces from the Nasalbari area and release the arrested peasants and workers.
