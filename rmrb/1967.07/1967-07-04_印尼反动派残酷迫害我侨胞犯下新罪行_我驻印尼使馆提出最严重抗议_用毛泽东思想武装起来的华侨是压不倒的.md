The Indonesian reactionaries have brutally persecuted our overseas Chinese, committing new crimes. The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia has lodged the most serious protest.

	New Hua Xian News Agency, July 3rd: Jakarta News: The Chinese Embassy in Indonesia sent a note to the Indonesian Ministry of Foreign Affairs on June 29, lodging the most serious protest against the new fascist atrocities committed by the right-wing military regime in Indonesia in Nan Hai Zhang, where they cruelly persecuted overseas Chinese.

	On June 22, the military authorities in Nan Hai Zhang dispatched the head of the first section of the military sub-district, Su Xingnuo, leading a large number of armed military police, to surround several overseas Chinese shops in the city with murderous intent. They then broke in and forcibly occupied them. On that day, eight overseas Chinese shops were seized. On June 23, Su Xingnuo led a large number of heavily armed military police and so-called "takeover personnel" to the commercial district, seizing overseas Chinese shops. When they attempted to seize the shop of the overseas Chinese, Ye Jinshi, and were refused by the female shop owner, Su Xingnuo flew into a rage, revealing his ferocious nature, and struck the female shop owner's face. He then fired a warning shot. Following this, this group of fascist military police stormed into another overseas Chinese shop, forcibly occupying it, and brutally beating the unarmed shop owner and overseas Chinese with gun butts and belts. Even more barbaric was that this group of fascist military police, without any reason, forcibly took away forty-nine overseas Chinese to the military sub-district headquarters, not even sparing six children under the age of fourteen. Once the captured overseas Chinese arrived at the military headquarters, they were brutally beaten by military police and thugs who had been summoned in advance by the Nan Hai Zhang military authorities. They were then illegally imprisoned. On June 24, two local community leaders who went to visit the captured overseas Chinese and negotiate with the military authorities were also illegally detained.

	The Chinese Embassy stated in the note that this was the second large-scale fascist atrocity committed by the Indonesian right-wing military regime in Nan Hai Zhang in less than a month.

	The note said: "We must warn the Indonesian government that you attempt to use fascist violence to subdue the vast number of overseas Chinese armed with Mao Zedong Thought. This is simply a pipe dream. The seven hundred million Chinese people, who are currently triumphantly carrying out the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, will absolutely not tolerate your brutal persecution of overseas Chinese. Every debt you owe the Chinese people will be settled."

	The note said: "The Chinese Embassy firmly demands that the Indonesian government immediately punish the perpetrators and instigators of the above incident; immediately release the detained overseas Chinese; return the seized overseas Chinese shops and compensate for all losses; immediately stop all anti-Chinese and discriminatory racist atrocities. Otherwise, the Indonesian government must bear all serious consequences that arise from this."

　　印尼反动派残酷迫害我侨胞犯下新罪行
　　我驻印尼使馆提出最严重抗议
　　用毛泽东思想武装起来的华侨是压不倒的
    新华社三日讯　雅加达消息：中国驻印度尼西亚大使馆六月二十九日照会印度尼西亚外交部，最严重地抗议印度尼西亚右派军人政权最近在南海漳残酷迫害华侨的种族主义的新暴行。
    六月二十二日，南海漳军事当局指派军支区第一科科长苏西诺率领大批武装军警，杀气腾腾地包围了该市许多华侨商店，然后破门而入，强行霸占。当日被抢占的华侨商店竟达八家之多。二十三日，苏西诺又率领大批荷枪实弹的军警和所谓“接管人员”，气势汹汹地来到商业区，抢占华侨商店。当他们抢占华侨叶金士的商店被女店主严词拒绝时，苏西诺暴跳如雷，凶态毕露，动手猛打女店主脸部，并开枪恫吓。接着，这批法西斯军警又闯入另一家华侨商店强行霸占，并用枪托、皮带等疯狂毒打赤手空拳向他们说理的店主和华侨。更为野蛮的是，这批法西斯军警竟毫无道理地把四十九名华侨强行押往军支区司令部，连六名不到十四岁的小孩子也不放过。被捕华侨一到军部，又遭到南海漳军事当局事先增调的军警和打手的残暴围殴，接着又被非法关入监狱。二十四日，前往探望被捕华侨和向军事当局进行交涉的两名当地侨团负责人也遭到非法扣押。
    中国大使馆在照会中指出，这是在不到一个月的时间内，印尼右派军人政权在南海漳制造的两次大规模迫害华侨的法西斯暴行。
    照会说：“我们要正告印度尼西亚政府，你们妄图用法西斯的暴力手段来压服用毛泽东思想武装起来的广大华侨，这简直是白日作梦。”“正在胜利地进行着无产阶级文化大革命的七亿中国人民，对你们残酷迫害华侨是绝对不能容忍的。你们欠下中国人民的每一笔账，都是要清算的。”
    照会说：“中国大使馆坚决要求印度尼西亚政府立即惩办上述事件的肇事者和主使人；立即释放被捕华侨；退还强占的华侨商店，赔偿一切损失；立即停止一切反华、排华的种族主义暴行。否则，印度尼西亚政府必须承担由此而产生的一切严重后果。”
