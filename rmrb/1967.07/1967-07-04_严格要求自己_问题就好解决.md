	Strict Self-Demands Make Problems Easier to Solve
	Medical orderly of a certain unit of the Nanjing Military Region, Fu Kangnian

	Chairman Mao pointed out: "Generally speaking, contradictions among the people are contradictions among people with fundamental interests in common." Therefore, solving contradictions among the people "is a matter of distinguishing right from wrong." So, when contradictions arise between revolutionary organizations and between revolutionary comrades, they should be resolved through criticism and self-criticism to clarify right and wrong and achieve unity. Here, it is particularly important to emphasize the spirit of self-criticism. As long as both sides in a dispute can be strict with themselves, the problem will be easier to solve. I had such an experience when I was conducting military training at a certain school.

	At that time, I was with revolutionary teachers and students, carrying out rectification and criticizing the capitalist-roaders in power within the Party. In the process of revolutionary criticism, we gradually implemented revolutionary great unity by class. Unexpectedly, some students soon raised sharp criticisms against me. Hearing some harsh words, I couldn't immediately understand the situation and was worried about losing face. What should I do? I studied Chairman Mao's teachings on correctly handling contradictions among the people with this question in mind, and repeatedly compared myself with the "Three Articles" to raise my consciousness. Chairman Mao's teachings helped me realize in time that: the students' criticisms of me could help me correctly understand myself and correct my shortcomings. I should follow Chairman Mao's teachings, insist on what is right for the people's interests, correct what is wrong for the people's interests, and humbly accept the criticisms of the masses to do a better job in the future. Therefore, I convened separate meetings and had individual talks with the students to solicit their opinions extensively. In the process of listening to different opinions, I conducted serious and realistic self-criticism. As a result, not only were thoughts unified and barriers removed, but the students were also deeply moved. Later, when they had contradictions among themselves, they also handled them in this way, effectively promoting internal unity.

	In the process of handling contradictions among the people, for oneself, whether one can take criticism gladly and dare to engage in self-criticism is a matter of breaking with selfishness and establishing public-mindedness. If, when faced with a matter, one first thinks of one's own face, that is putting "self" first and will not sincerely solve contradictions. Therefore, in the process of handling contradictions among the people, one should demand of oneself a high degree of self-revolutionary spirit, consciously engage in breaking with selfishness and establishing public-mindedness; that is, to divide oneself into two parts, treating oneself both as a force for revolution and as an object of revolution. Only by correctly treating oneself can one correctly treat the masses and humbly accept the criticisms of the masses. In this way, we can better understand and transform the world.

　　严格要求自己  问题就好解决
　　南京部队某部卫生员　傅康年
    毛主席指出：“一般说来，人民内部的矛盾，是在人民利益根本一致的基础上的矛盾。”因而，解决人民内部矛盾“是分清是非的问题”。所以，在革命组织之间、革命同志之间出现了矛盾，就应当通过批评和自我批评弄清是非，达到团结的目的。在这里，要特别强调自我批评的精神。只要争论双方都能严于责己，问题就容易解决。我在某学校搞军训的时候，就有这样的体会。
    当时，我同革命师生在一起，边整风、边开展对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，并在革命的大批判过程中，逐步按教学班实行革命的大联合。谁知不久，有些同学对我提出了尖锐的批评。听了一些刺耳的话，我一时转不过弯来，担心自己下不了台。怎么办呢？我带着问题学习了毛主席关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的教导，还反复对照了“老三篇”，来提高自己的认识。毛主席的教导，使我及时认识到：同学们向我提出批评，可以帮助我正确认识自己，改正缺点。我应当遵照毛主席的教导，为人民利益坚持好的，为人民利益改正错的，虚心听取群众的批评，把今后的工作做得更好。于是我分别召集了座谈会，和同学们个别谈心，广泛征求他们的意见。在听取不同意见的过程中，进行既认真严肃、又实事求是的自我批评。这样做的结果，不仅统一了思想，消除了隔阂，而且使同学们很受感动。以后，他们自己互相之间有了矛盾，也照这样办，有效地促进了内部团结。
    在处理人民内部矛盾的过程中，对于自己来说，能不能闻过则喜，勇于自我批评，是一个破私立公的问题。如果一事当前，首先想到的是自己的面子，那就是“私”字当头，就不会诚心诚意地去解决矛盾。因此，在处理人民内部矛盾的过程中，应该要求自己具有高度的自我革命的精神，自觉地进行破私立公；也就是要对自己一分为二，既把自己当作革命的动力，又把自己当作革命的对象。只有正确对待自己，才会正确对待群众，才会虚心听取群众的批评。这样，我们就能更好地认识世界和改造世界。
