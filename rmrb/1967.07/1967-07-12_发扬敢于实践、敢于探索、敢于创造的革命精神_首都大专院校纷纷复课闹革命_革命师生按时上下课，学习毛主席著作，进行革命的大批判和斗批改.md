The news of Beijing Aviation Institute resuming classes and making revolution has sparked a wave of similar actions in other colleges and universities in the capital. A great situation of resuming classes and making revolution has emerged.

Currently, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Institute of Geology, Beijing Institute of Posts and Telecommunications, Beijing Institute of Political Science and Law, Beijing Institute of Mining, the Foreign Affairs College, and the Institute of International Relations, among others, have followed Beijing Aviation Institute in resuming classes and making revolution. China Medical University has decided to resume classes and make revolution on the 12th. Many other schools have either partially resumed classes or will do so soon.

Resuming classes and making revolution marks a new stage in the development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the capital's colleges and universities. After the July 5th issue of the People's Daily published the news of Beijing Aviation Institute resuming classes and making revolution, it sparked a strong response among the revolutionary teachers and students in the capital's colleges and universities. They said that the revolutionary cadres and revolutionary students in colleges and universities should be the vanguard of resuming classes and making revolution, taking immediate action to join the battle of resuming classes and making revolution, and turning the capital's colleges and universities into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Revolutionary teachers and students in various schools have expressed their determination to learn from the comrades of Beijing Aviation Institute. They wrote big-character posters, held discussions and meetings, and engaged in heated discussions on the issue of resuming classes and making revolution. Many revolutionary teachers and students, after heated discussions, believed that resuming classes and making revolution is a necessity for the current struggle in colleges and universities, an important guarantee for carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, and an important measure to enhance the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of revolutionary teachers and students, and to establish a new revolutionary order. It will further promote the deepening of revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation of schools, further develop and consolidate the revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Revolutionary teachers and students have seriously and enthusiastically made suggestions and put forward plans on the issue of resuming classes and making revolution. The revolutionary committees and revolutionary mass organizations of some schools have promptly made decisions on resuming classes and making revolution, and held oath-taking or mobilization meetings.

Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" states: "Students should also focus on learning, while also learning other things, that is, not only learning literature but also learning industry, agriculture, and military affairs, and also criticizing the bourgeoisie. The school system should be shortened, education should be revolutionized, and the phenomenon of bourgeois intellectuals dominating our schools should no longer continue." All schools emphasize in their decisions on resuming classes and making revolution that Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" is the guiding principle for resuming classes and making revolution. At present, resuming classes and making revolution means focusing on deepening revolutionary criticism, carrying out struggle, criticism, and transformation, and gradually transitioning to "focusing on learning." Currently, these schools are launching a new high tide of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to fiercely fight against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, fiercely criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, and fiercely criticize bourgeois reactionary academic "authorities." Schools that are currently undergoing rectification will also continue to do so well.

In resuming classes and making revolution, the revolutionary youngsters have further carried forward the spirit of daring to make revolution, daring to practice, and daring to innovate, exploring the content, methods, and steps of resuming classes and making revolution under the guidance of our great leader Chairman Mao's revolutionary educational line. They follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "Revolutionary war is the people's business, often not learning first and then doing, but doing and then learning. Doing is learning." They practice, summarize, and improve. Now, many schools have posted numerous big-character posters with various specific plans and opinions on resuming classes and making revolution.

To gradually implement Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" on "learning industry, agriculture, and military affairs," various schools have made appropriate arrangements in their plans for resuming classes and making revolution. Some schools have factories on campus, and currently, learning industry is mainly arranged on campus. Some schools have established contacts with nearby factories and rural people's communes, going out for labor at regular intervals and combining with workers and peasants. In terms of learning military affairs, all schools have arranged a certain amount of time for military training.

In resuming classes and making revolution, various schools also pay great attention to the role of revolutionary teachers and revolutionary cadres. They advocate that revolutionary teachers go to the students, study Chairman Mao's works together with the students, jointly carry out revolutionary criticism, jointly carry out educational revolution, and jointly learn industry, agriculture, and military affairs. They advocate mutual teaching and learning, teaching and learning from each other, and establishing a revolutionary teaching order and a proletarian revolutionary teacher-student relationship.

After resuming classes and making revolution, the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of revolutionary teachers and students have been strengthened. Teachers and students get up on time, do exercises on time, attend classes on time, study Chairman Mao's works, and carry out revolutionary criticism and struggle, criticism, and transformation. Schools that have not yet achieved revolutionary great unity have, through resuming classes and making revolution, brought back all factions of students to the classroom to discuss various issues together, creating conditions for achieving revolutionary great unity.

    发扬敢于实践、敢于探索、敢于创造的革命精神
    首都大专院校纷纷复课闹革命
    革命师生按时上下课，学习毛主席著作，进行革命的大批判和斗批改
    据新华社十一日讯　北京航空学院复课闹革命的喜讯传出以后，首都大专院校的革命师生闻风而动，出现一片复课闹革命的大好形势。
    目前已有北京师范大学、北京地质学院、北京邮电学院、北京政法学院、北京矿业学院、外交学院和国际关系学院等大专院校，继北京航空学院之后，陆续开始复课闹革命。中国医科大学已决定在十二日复课闹革命。其他许多学校有的已有部分班级复课闹革命，有的最近也要陆续开始复课闹革命。
    复课闹革命，标志着首都大专院校无产阶级文化大革命进入一个新的发展阶段。七月五日，《人民日报》刊登北京航空学院复课闹革命的消息后，在首都大专院校的广大革命师生中引起了强烈的反响。他们说，大专院校的无产阶级革命派和革命师生，应该成为复课闹革命的急先锋，立即行动起来，投入复课闹革命的战斗，把首都大专院校办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
    各校广大革命师生，纷纷表示要向北京航空学院的战友们学习，他们写大字报，开座谈会、讨论会，就复课闹革命问题，展开热烈的讨论。许多革命师生经过热烈的讨论后认为，复课闹革命是大专院校当前斗争发展的需要，是把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的重要保证，是提高革命师生革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，建立革命的新秩序的重要措施；它将进一步推动革命的大批判和学校斗、批、改的深入发展，进一步发展和巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。革命师生们认真地、热情地就复课闹革命问题提建议，出方案，一些学校的革命委员会和革命群众组织及时作出复课闹革命的决定，并且举行了誓师大会或动员大会。
    毛主席在“五·七”指示中说：“学生也是这样，以学为主，兼学别样，即不但学文，也要学工、学农、学军，也要批判资产阶级。学制要缩短，教育要革命，资产阶级知识分子统治我们学校的现象，再也不能继续下去了。”各校在复课闹革命的决定中都强调指出：毛主席的“五·七”指示，是复课闹革命的奋斗纲领。在当前，复课闹革命，是以深入开展革命的大批判为主，搞斗、批、改，以后逐步过渡到“以学为主”。目前，这些学校正在掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想，狠斗党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，狠批反革命修正主义的教育路线，狠批资产阶级反动学术“权威”。一些正在整风的学校，也要继续把整风搞好。
    革命小将在复课闹革命中，进一步发扬了敢于革命、敢于实践、大胆创造的革命精神，沿着我们伟大领袖毛主席的革命教育路线，探索复课闹革命的内容、方法和步骤。他们遵循毛主席的教导：“革命战争是民众的事，常常不是先学好了再干，而是干起来再学习，干就是学习。”边实践，边总结，边改进。现在，许多学校贴出许多关于复课闹革命的各种具体方案和意见的大字报。
    为了逐步实现毛主席“五·七”指示中关于“学工、学农、学军”的指示，各学校复课闹革命的方案里作了适当安排。有的院校校内有工厂，目前学工主要安排在校内进行。有的院校和附近工厂、农村人民公社取得联系，定期下去劳动，和工农结合。在学军方面，各校都安排了一定的军训活动时间。
    在复课闹革命中，各校也很重视革命教师和革命干部的作用。提倡革命教师到学生中去，和学生一起学习毛主席著作，一起开展革命的大批判，一起进行教育革命，一同学工、学农、学军，提倡互教互学，教学相长，建立起革命的教学秩序和无产阶级的革命师生关系。
    复课闹革命开始以后，加强了革命师生的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性。师生们按时起床，按时做操，按时上下课，学习毛主席著作，进行革命的大批判和斗、批、改。当前还没有实现革命的大联合的学校，通过复课闹革命，各派同学都回到班级，共同商讨各种问题，为实现革命大联合创造了条件。
