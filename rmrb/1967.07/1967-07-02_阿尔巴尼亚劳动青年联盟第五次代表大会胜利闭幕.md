The glory belongs to the Party! The glory belongs to the youth! The glory belongs to Marxism-Leninism!

The Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Youth League concluded successfully on the afternoon of June 29th with the triumphant song "One Hand Holding a Pickaxe, the Other Holding a Gun."

The beloved leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, along with other Party and state leaders such as Shehu and List, attended the closing ceremony.

During the four-day congress, representatives listened to and discussed the report by the First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Youth League, Meho, titled "On the Activities of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Youth League and the Implementation of the Resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party on the Revolutionary Education of the Youth." They also passed a resolution on "Amendments to the Charter of the Albanian Labor Youth League."

Over 30 representatives from factories, mines, agricultural cooperatives, schools, and the military reported on their achievements in implementing the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Party and the teachings of Comrade Hoxha. They highlighted their progress in work, study, and ideological revolution, their struggles against religious superstitions, backward customs, bureaucracy, and bourgeois ideology, and their efforts in education, labor, sports, military training, and the defense of the motherland.

The congress also established five specialized committees to discuss these issues and passed five resolutions. These resolutions are: "Political and Ideological Education of Youth and the Cultivation of Revolutionary Spirit in Youth is the Fundamental Task of the Albanian Labor Youth League"; "On Further Enhancing the Role of the Albanian Labor Youth League in the Cultural and Aesthetic Education of Youth"; "On Educating Youth Through Labor"; "On Expanding and Strengthening the Albanian Labor Youth League's Educational Activities for Young Women and Making Them Active Forces in the Struggle for the Complete Liberation of Women"; "On Further Strengthening the Work of Educating Young Pioneers with Communist Moral Qualities and Cultivating Revolutionary Spirit in Young Pioneers."

This congress fully demonstrated the proletarian internationalist spirit of the Albanian youth under the correct leadership of the Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Hoxha, reflecting their anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist stance and their support for the struggles of the revolutionary peoples of the world.

In his speech at the congress, Kolaras, a member of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Youth League, strongly condemned the Soviet revisionists for promoting a revisionist line in the international youth and student movements, disrupting the anti-imperialist revolutionary struggles of progressive youth in various countries. He said that in the struggle against the modern revisionists, who are the agents of imperialism, there can be no middle ground, and no "united actions" or "joint actions" with them. Undoubtedly, the establishment of a united front of revolutionary youth and students, excluding revisionists and their lackeys, will strongly promote the struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered around the Soviet leadership. This will inevitably accelerate the common cause of progressive youth and students around the world in opposing imperialism, capitalism, and the revisionism of Khrushchev and Tito, and in striving for the victory of revolution and socialism worldwide.

When talking about the fighting friendship between Albanian youth and the youth of brotherly China, he said, the youth of brotherly China are at the forefront of the world's revolutionary youth in the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggle. Under the leadership of Chairman Mao Zedong and guided by Mao Zedong Thought, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China has dealt a heavy blow to imperialists and modern revisionists. The Red Guards of the Chinese revolution have become an important force in the struggle for the victory of Marxism-Leninism and revolution, setting a great example and inspiration for the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist struggles of all youth around the world.

The congress passed a resolution on "Supporting the Liberation Struggle of the Heroic Vietnamese People and Youth." The resolution stated, "The Albanian youth strongly condemn the aggressive war of the United States with extreme indignation and express their internationalist solidarity with the Vietnamese youth." The resolution pointed out: "The allies and accomplices of American imperialism, the Khrushchev revisionists, continue to collude with the butchers of the Vietnamese people. The recent friendly meeting between Johnson and Kosygin once again clearly demonstrates this. They attempt to force the Vietnamese people to surrender." The resolution said, "The Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Youth League once again assures the brotherly Vietnamese youth that the Albanian youth will support their sacred struggle for national liberation against the aggression of American imperialism and its tools and accomplices to the end."

The congress also passed a resolution on "Supporting the Youth of Arab Countries." The resolution strongly condemned the war of aggression against Arab countries planned, instigated, and directly participated in by American and British imperialism. The resolution also pointed out: The struggle of the Arab peoples and youth against imperialism and Israeli aggression has been sabotaged by the betrayal and treachery of the Khrushchev revisionists. The Khrushchev revisionists are the fire brigade of the just wars of the Arab peoples, and they collude with American imperialism behind the backs of the Arab peoples. They are false friends of the Arab peoples and faithful collaborators of American imperialism.

During the congress, representatives from 26 countries who were invited to attend the congress delivered speeches. The majority of the foreign youth representatives highly praised the Albanian youth, who, under the loving care and guidance of the Albanian Labor Party and Comrade Hoxha, have shown a fearless spirit of daring to revolutionize, dare to struggle, and dare to win in their anti-imperialist, anti-revisionist, and socialist revolutionary and socialist construction. They also enthusiastically praised the invincible Mao Zedong Thought that guides the struggles of revolutionary youth around the world, and sang the praises of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, which has significant international implications and is unprecedented in history, and the Chinese Red Guard movement.

During the congress, over 12,000 youth volunteers participating in the construction of the Logjcën-Fieri railway and the Durrës-Mallakastër highway sent several hundred representatives to the congress venue, holding red flags and reporting their dual victories in ideology and labor to the congress. They also presented gifts to their most beloved leader and teacher, Comrade Hoxha.

The congress also awarded red banners and certificates to outstanding units that won in the socialist emulation held to welcome the congress.

Finally, the congress elected a new central leadership for the Labor Youth League. Meho was elected as the First Secretary, and Kasmi, Bedalli, Brajshia, and Monari as Secretaries.

At the end of the congress, the entire audience stood up and cheered for a long time: "The Party!" "Enver Hoxha!" At this moment, Comrade Hoxha raised his hand and shouted to the crowd: "Glory to the Party! Glory to the youth! Glory to Marxism-Leninism!"

The congress concluded with the stirring songs of "The Internationale" and "One Hand Holding a Pickaxe, the Other Holding a Gun."

After the congress, the youth marched in the rain and gathered at Skanderbeg Square in Tirana to watch fireworks. (Accompanied by a picture)

　　光荣属于党！光荣属于青年！光荣属于马克思列宁主义！
　　阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟第五次代表大会胜利闭幕
　　阿人民的伟大领袖霍查同志以及谢胡、列希等党和国家领导人出席闭幕式
    大会通过了关于对青年进行政治思想教育问题等决议，选举了新的中央领导机构
    新华社地拉那三十日电　阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟第五次代表大会，二十九日下午在“一手拿镐，一手拿枪”的凯歌声中，胜利闭幕。
    阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的伟大领袖霍查同志以及谢胡、列希等党和国家领导人出席了闭幕式。
    在为期四天的阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟第五次代表大会上，代表们听取、讨论并一致通过了阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟中央第一书记梅罗所作的“关于阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟中央的活动和执行阿尔巴尼亚劳动党五大关于对青年一代进行革命教育的决议”的报告，通过了“关于阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟章程若干修改”的决议。
    三十多名来自工矿企业、农业社、学校和部队的青年代表在大会发言，汇报了他们在贯彻阿尔巴尼亚劳动党五大决议和霍查同志的教导，在工作、学习和思想进一步革命化方面，在反对宗教迷信、落后习俗、官僚主义和资产阶级思想等阶级斗争中，在学习、劳动、体育运动和军训以及保卫祖国的斗争中，所取得的巨大成就。
    大会还就这些问题组织了五个专题委员会，分组进行了讨论，并通过了五个决议。这五个决议是：“对青年进行政治思想教育和以阶级的革命精神锻炼青年是阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟的基本任务”；“关于进一步提高阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟组织对青年进行文化和美学教育的作用”；“关于在劳动中并通过劳动教育青年”；“关于阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟扩大和加强对女青年的教育活动并使她们成为争取完全解放妇女斗争的积极力量”；“关于进一步加强以共产主义道德品质教育少先队员和以阶级的革命精神锻炼少先队员的工作”。
    这次大会充分表现了在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和霍查同志正确教导下的阿尔巴尼亚青年反帝反修和支持世界革命人民斗争的无产阶级国际主义精神。
    阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟中央书记科拉内斯在大会发言中，强烈谴责苏联修正主义者在国际青年和学生运动中推行修正主义路线，破坏各国进步青年的反帝革命斗争。他说，在反对帝国主义的代理人现代修正主义者的斗争中，不能搞中间道路，同他们不能搞什么“统一行动”和“联合行动”。毫无疑问，建立没有修正主义者及其走狗参加的革命青年和学生的团结，将有力地推动反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏联领导集团为中心的现代修正主义的斗争，必将加速全世界进步青年和学生反对帝国主义、反对资本主义制度、反对赫鲁晓夫和铁托修正主义者、争取革命和社会主义在全世界胜利的共同事业的必然胜利。
    他在谈到阿尔巴尼亚青年同兄弟的中国青年的战斗友谊时说，兄弟的中国青年站在世界革命青年反帝、反修斗争的最前列。在毛泽东主席的领导和毛泽东思想照耀下的中国无产阶级文化大革命，给了帝国主义者和现代修正主义者以沉重打击。中国革命的红卫兵已经成为争取马克思列宁主义和革命胜利的重要力量，他们对世界所有青年反对帝国主义和现代修正主义的斗争是一个伟大的榜样和鼓舞。
    大会通过了关于“声援英雄的越南人民和青年的解放斗争的决议”。决议说，“阿尔巴尼亚青年怀着极其愤怒的心情强烈谴责美国的侵略战争，并向越南青年表示国际主义的战斗声援。”决议指出：“美帝国主义的同盟者和合作者赫鲁晓夫修正主义者继续同越南人民的刽子手进行交易。约翰逊同柯西金最近的亲切会谈再次清楚地表现了这一点。他们妄图迫使越南人民屈膝投降。”决议说，“阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟五大再次向兄弟的越南青年保证，阿尔巴尼亚青年将对越南青年反对美帝国主义及其工具和合作者的侵略的神圣的救国斗争，支持到底。”
    大会还通过了关于“声援阿拉伯各国青年的决议”。决议强烈谴责美英帝国主义策划、煽动和直接参加侵略阿拉伯各国的战争。决议还指出：阿拉伯各国人民和青年反对帝国主义和以色列侵略的斗争被赫鲁晓夫修正主义者的叛变和背信弃义所破坏。赫鲁晓夫修正主义者是阿拉伯各国人民正义战争的消防队，并在阿拉伯各国人民背后同美帝进行交易。他们是阿拉伯各国人民的假朋友，是美帝国主义的忠实合作者。
    在大会上，应邀出席这次大会的二十六个国家的青年代表先后致了贺词。绝大多数外国青年代表在贺词中，高度赞扬在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和霍查同志亲切关怀和教育下的阿尔巴尼亚青年，在反帝反修和社会主义革命、社会主义建设中敢于革命、敢于斗争和敢于胜利的大无畏精神。他们还热情赞扬指导世界革命青年斗争的战无不胜的毛泽东思想，歌颂具有重大国际意义的、史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命和中国红卫兵运动。
    在大会期间，正在参加洛格齐恩—费里铁路和大马列西亚公路建设的一万二千多名青年义务劳动者，派了几百名代表高举红旗，列队步入大会会场，向大会报告了他们思想劳动双丰收的喜讯，并向自己的最敬爱的领袖和导师霍查同志献礼。
    大会还向在为迎接这次大会而举行的社会主义竞赛中获胜的优秀单位，授予红旗和奖状。
    大会最后选举了劳动青年联盟新的中央领导机构。梅罗为中央第一书记，卡斯米、贝达利、布拉希亚和莫纳里为书记。
    大会结束时，全场起立，长时间欢呼：“劳动党！”
    “恩维尔·霍查！”这时，霍查同志举手向群众高呼：
    “光荣属于党！光荣属于青年！光荣属于马克思列宁主义！”
    大会在激昂的《国际歌》和《一手拿镐，一手拿枪》的歌声中结束。
    大会后，青年们冒雨进行了游行，并欢聚在地拉那“斯坎德培广场”上观看焰火。（附图片）
