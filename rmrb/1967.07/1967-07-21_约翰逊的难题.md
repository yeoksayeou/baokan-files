Johnson's Dilemma

Hong Yu

More troops, more troops, more troops! The heroic South Vietnamese military and people have driven the invading U.S. forces, led by Westmoreland, into a state of panic. Recently, from his headquarters in Saigon, Westmoreland has sent one urgent appeal after another to Washington.

Regarding Westmoreland's demands, American newspapers have differing reports. Some say ten thousand, others say twenty thousand. At the very least, an increase of ten thousand troops is already an "open secret" in Washington.

Since the end of 1963, the United States has mobilized its forces, gathering troops from all directions, and has finally managed to increase the number of U.S. troops in Vietnam to over 460,000. Now, Westmoreland suddenly demands an increase of ten to twenty thousand troops. This must surely make Johnson feel troubled?

To decide on the issue of increasing troops and by how much, Johnson recently sent McNamara to South Vietnam to investigate the situation. After his inspection, McNamara concluded that "what South Vietnam needs depends on how effectively we use the forces we already have," meaning that the issue of increasing troops should be resolved by improving the combat effectiveness of U.S. forces in South Vietnam. The American press believes that "this is equivalent to criticizing Westmoreland."

Westmoreland, of course, is not satisfied and immediately left Saigon to complain to the White House, reiterating his "reason for requesting the deployment of an additional ten thousand troops" before McNamara could report back.

Nevertheless, Johnson still finds it difficult to generously meet the demands of this U.S. commander in Vietnam. At a press conference on the 13th, he merely vaguely stated, "The troops that General Westmoreland needs and requests, and that we believe can be accepted, will be provided." This is equivalent to saying, you can make your request for more troops, but I still have to consider my difficulties.

Of course, Johnson knows that such a statement is very embarrassing for Westmoreland. Therefore, on the one hand, he repeatedly declared at this press conference that he and his subordinates had "reached a consensus on the issue of increasing troops," and on the other hand, he praised Westmoreland, boasting about the "progress" made by U.S. forces in South Vietnam. In this situation, Westmoreland could only self-deprecatingly declare that he had never proposed a "specific number of troops to be deployed."

The turmoil over the issue of increasing troops reflects the predicament of U.S. imperialism's paper tiger in South Vietnam. Regarding the urgent need to increase troops and expand the war, Johnson, McNamara, and Westmoreland originally had no disagreements. Johnson is very sympathetic to Westmoreland's demands, but he is short on resources. At a time when U.S. manpower is depleted and resources are strained, a large-scale increase in troops not only requires the mobilization of reserve forces but will also greatly increase military expenditures, budget deficits, and jeopardize the already deteriorating U.S. economic situation. This makes Johnson hesitant.

But what if they do not increase troops? To salvage the failing war in Vietnam, U.S. imperialism has no other choice but to invest more manpower. However, whether Johnson, McNamara, or Westmoreland, none of them have confidence in whether a large-scale increase in troops can turn the situation around, because despite continuous increases in troops, the situation of the U.S. aggressors on the battlefields of South Vietnam is getting worse and worse. The Chicago Sun-Times revealed that "Johnson must be uneasy about the current strategy, because this strategy requires continuous large-scale increases in troops, but there is no significant progress."

In summary, increasing troops is difficult, and not increasing troops is even more difficult. For Johnson, this is the dilemma he faces today. The arguments within the Washington ruling clique over the issue of increasing troops are, in essence, a vivid portrayal of U.S. imperialism's predicament in its invasion of Vietnam, finding no way out.

    约翰逊的难题
    红宇
    增兵，增兵，增兵！被英雄的南越军民打得焦头烂额的侵越美军头子威斯特摩兰，最近从他的西贡总部向华盛顿发出了一道又一道十万火急的求援书。
    对于威斯特摩兰的要价，美国报刊说法不一。有说十万，有说二十万。至少，增兵十万，在华盛顿已是“公开的秘密”。
    美国从一九六三年底以来，劳师动众，东拼西凑，才好不容易把侵越美军的兵力增加到目前的四十六万多人。现在威斯特摩兰却一下子就要求增兵一、二十万，这岂不是使约翰逊感到为难吗？
    为了对增兵与否和增兵多少的问题作出决定，约翰逊最近特地派麦克纳马拉到南越去一探虚实。麦克纳马拉在南越视察后的结论认为，南越“需要什么取决于我们使用所已有的这些（美军）力量的有效程度”，也就是说，增兵的问题要靠提高南越美军战斗力来解决。美国报界认为，“这等于是对威斯特摩兰的非难”。
    威斯特摩兰当然不服气，就立即从西贡动身，抢在麦克纳马拉回国汇报的同时向白宫告状，重申他“要求增派十万名军队的理由”。
    尽管如此，约翰逊还是难以慷慨地满足这个侵越美军司令的要求。他在十三日举行的记者招待会上，只是含糊其词地表示，“威斯特摩兰将军需要和要求，而我们认为可以接受的军队，将予以提供”。这等于是说，你可以提你的增兵要求，我还得考虑我的困难。
    当然，约翰逊知道，这种表示对于威斯特摩兰是十分难堪的。因此，他一方面在这次记者招待会上一再表白他和他的下属已经就增兵问题“取得一致意见”，另一方面又对威斯特摩兰慰勉有加，吹嘘什么美军在南越“取得的进展”。在这种情况下，威斯特摩兰就只好自我解嘲地表白，他并未提出过“要求增派军队的具体数字”。
    在增兵问题上发生的这一场风波，反映了美帝国主义纸老虎在南越的窘境。对于急需增兵扩战这一点，约翰逊、麦克纳马拉同威斯特摩兰本来并无矛盾。约翰逊对于威斯特摩兰的要求，是十分同情的，只不过心有余而力不足。在这美国兵源枯竭、捉襟见肘之时，大举增兵不仅需要动员预备役部队，而且必然大大增加军费开支，预算赤字，危及现在已经恶化的美国经济状况。这就使约翰逊不能不有所顾虑。
    但是，不继续增兵又怎么办呢？为了挽救侵越战争的败局，美帝国主义除了投入更多的兵力，已经别无他途了。不过，约翰逊也好，麦克纳马拉也好，威斯特摩兰也好，对于大量增兵是否能够转败为胜，也是毫无信心的，因为尽管不断增兵，美国侵略者在南越战场上的处境还是越来越坏。《芝加哥太阳时报》就透露说，“约翰逊一定对目前的战略感到不安，因为这个战略要求不断的大量增兵，却没有什么显著的进展”。
    总而言之，增兵难，不增兵更难。对于约翰逊来说，今天就是这样的左右为难，难上加难。华盛顿统治集团在增兵问题上的争吵，实质上就是美帝国主义陷在侵越困境中找不到出路的一个活生生的写照。
