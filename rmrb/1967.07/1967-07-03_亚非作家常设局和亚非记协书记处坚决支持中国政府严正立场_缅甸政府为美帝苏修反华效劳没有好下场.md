The Asia-Africa Writers' Permanent Bureau and the Asia-Africa Journalists' Association Secretariat firmly support the Chinese Government's serious position
The Burmese government will meet a bad end for serving the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists to oppose China

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated July 2, the Asia-Africa Writers' Permanent Bureau issued a statement on July 1 strongly condemning the Burmese reactionary government for creating a frenzied anti-China incident and firmly supporting the clear and serious position of the Government of the People's Republic of China.

The statement pointed out that the Burmese reactionary government's evil attack on the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Burma and the Chinese residents in Burma was instigated and incited by U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism. Just as the actions of the fascist military regime of Suharto-Nasution in Indonesia, the reactionary clique in India, and the British colonial authorities in Hong Kong were instigated and incited by U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism. They all acted as lackeys of U.S. imperialism. In this way, they could beg for aid from the number one enemy of the people of the world, U.S. imperialism, to maintain their reactionary regimes.

The statement said that in the white terror created by the Burmese reactionary government, we clearly saw the conspiracy plotted by U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism, attempting to suppress the influence of the great proletarian cultural revolution in China, personally initiated by the great leader of the world revolutionary people, Chairman Mao Zedong, which shook the world. Their purpose was also to prevent the Burmese people from mastering Mao Zedong Thought, this powerful weapon. This purpose will never be realized. On the contrary, the great proletarian cultural revolution in China greatly inspired the revolutionary people who are fighting for liberation and to defend their independence. Their attempt to stop the spread of the brilliant and invincible Mao Zedong Thought, which has deeply rooted in the hearts of revolutionary people all over the world, is completely in vain.

The statement said that the Burmese reactionary government has long pursued reactionary policies, causing serious economic difficulties and chaos at home, causing strong dissatisfaction and resistance among the Burmese people. The Burmese people have launched armed struggles to overthrow the reactionary government's rule. The Burmese reactionary government attempted to divert the strong dissatisfaction of the Burmese people who are rising up to oppose its exploitation and oppression by using anti-China sentiment. However, they are only "lifting a rock to drop on their own feet" and will surely meet with complete failure. The Burmese people will ultimately win.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report dated July 2, the Secretariat of the Asia-Africa Journalists' Association issued a statement on July 1 condemning the Burmese reactionary government for serving the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists to oppose China and "contain" China's policy, using thugs to brutally kill and attack Chinese diplomatic personnel, Chinese experts, and Chinese residents.

The statement said that the Burmese ruling clique's launch of an anti-China movement and the cruel persecution of Chinese residents fully exposed the true face of the Burmese ruling clique. To cover up their economic collapse and to please the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, the Burmese ruling clique imposed white terror on Chinese residents, attempting to divert the Burmese people's anti-imperialist struggle.

The statement said that the Burmese ruling clique used thugs to attack Chinese diplomatic personnel, killing Chinese personnel sent to Burma to be in charge of Chinese loans and Chinese residents in Burma. This is not an isolated incident but is closely linked to the anti-China conspiracy of the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists. Chairman Mao once pointed out: "'Lifting a rock to drop on one's own feet,' this is a Chinese proverb describing the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of all countries are exactly such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people will, in the final analysis, only promote a broader and more intense revolution among the people." The Burmese ruling clique, serving imperialism, will face the same shameful end as all reactionaries.

The statement finally said that the Secretariat of the Asia-Africa Journalists' Association is convinced that this incident instigated by the Burmese ruling clique will not affect the unity between the Burmese and Chinese peoples, but will further strengthen their struggle against imperialism led by the United States, revisionism led by the Soviet Union, and all reactionaries.

　　亚非作家常设局和亚非记协书记处坚决支持中国政府严正立场
　　缅甸政府为美帝苏修反华效劳没有好下场
    据新华社二日讯　亚非作家常设局一日发表声明，强烈谴责缅甸反动政府制造疯狂的反华事件，坚决支持中华人民共和国政府明确而严正的立场。
    声明指出，缅甸反动政府对中华人民共和国驻缅甸大使馆和缅甸华侨发动的罪恶的袭击，是受美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的鼓动和唆使的。正象印尼苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权、印度反动集团和香港英国殖民主义当局的行动受到美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义的鼓动和唆使一样。他们都充当了美帝国主义的奴仆。这样，他们就能够从这个全世界人民的头号敌人美帝国主义那里乞求援助，以便维持他们的反动政权。
    声明说，在缅甸反动政府制造的反华的白色恐怖中，我们清楚地看到了美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义策划的阴谋，妄图遏制世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席亲自发动的震撼世界的中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响。其目的也是为了阻止缅甸人民掌握毛泽东思想这个强大武器。这个目的是永远不能实现的。相反，中国无产阶级文化大革命大大地鼓舞了起来为争取解放和维护他们的独立而斗争的革命人民。他们企图制止已经在全世界革命人民心中深深扎下根的光辉的战无不胜的毛泽东思想的传播，完全是徒劳的。
    声明说，缅甸反动政府长期奉行反动政策，在国内造成了严重的经济困难和混乱，造成了缅甸人民的强烈不满和反抗。缅甸人民为推翻反动政府的统治而发动了武装斗争。缅甸反动政府妄图以反华来转移正在起来反对它的剥削和压迫的缅甸人民的强烈不满情绪。但是，他们只是“搬起石头打自己的脚”，必将遭到彻底的失败，缅甸人民终将取得胜利。
    据新华社二日讯　亚非新闻工作者协会书记处一日发表声明，谴责缅甸反动政府为美帝和苏修反对中国和“遏制”中国的政策卖力，利用暴徒，野蛮地杀害和袭击中国外交人员、中国专家和中国侨民的暴行。
    声明说，缅甸统治集团掀起反华运动以及对中国侨民进行残酷迫害，彻头彻尾地暴露了缅甸统治集团的真面目。为了掩盖它们在经济上遭到崩溃的丑态和讨好美帝和苏修，缅甸统治集团对中国侨民实行了白色恐怖，妄图以此转移缅甸人民反帝斗争的目标。
    声明说，缅甸统治集团利用暴徒对中国的外交人员进行袭击，杀害了中国派往缅甸负责中国贷款工程的人员和在缅甸的中国侨民，这决不是孤立的事件，而是跟美帝和苏修的反华阴谋紧紧地连在一起的。毛主席曾指出：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”缅甸的统治集团为帝国主义效劳，将面临同所有反动派一样的可耻下场。
    声明最后说，亚非记协书记处深信，缅甸统治集团唆使的这个事件，将不会影响存在于缅甸和中国人民之间的团结，而且会进一步加强他们反对以美国为首的帝国主义，以苏联为首的修正主义和一切反动派的斗争。
