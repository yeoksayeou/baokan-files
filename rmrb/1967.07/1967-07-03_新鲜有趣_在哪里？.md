Engels once said: “In the eyes of the bourgeoisie, nothing in the world exists except for money, and they themselves are no exception, because they live only to make money…”

The old gentlemen of Soviet revisionism have also degenerated into such money-grubbing, profit-seeking bourgeois merchants. In recent years, the Soviet revisionists have been facing numerous economic difficulties. In order to earn foreign exchange, they have not only set up foreign exchange shops across the country to make dollars, pounds, francs, and marks, but also dumped large quantities of gold on the Western European market and even auctioned off ancestral antiques.

However, despite all this, they still cannot plug the economic leaks of the Soviet revisionist clique. Therefore, they rack their brains and exhaust their ingenuity to do a big tourism business, hoping to earn a large amount of foreign exchange by attracting Western tourists. According to reports from Soviet revisionist newspapers, the Soviet Union has announced 1967 as the "International Tourism Year," and "countless guests from all over the world" will come to the Soviet Union for tourism. To receive the approximately 1.5 million foreign tourists who are about to arrive, several major cities in the Soviet Union are undergoing large-scale construction, building things like car hotels and outdoor hotels. According to the _Moscow Pravda_ and _Lenin Banner_, Moscow has newly built a hotel with 4,500 rooms and 8,100 beds, and the area of hotels in the city center will approximately double. At the same time, they are urgently training a large number of "hospitality experts" who will say to "all those who are preparing to come to the capital": "Dear friends, welcome to the great year of Moscow!"

The year 1967 was originally the 50th anniversary of the great October Socialist Revolution. Now the Soviet revisionist clique is using this festival to do big advertising and attract customers, which is truly sad and lamentable. Through this matter, the true faces of traitors like Brezhnev and Kosygin, who are waving the banner of "Marxism-Leninism" and "communism," are not completely exposed?

Of course, the problem is not just that. The so-called "International Tourism Year" is, in essence, a dirty political deal between the Soviet revisionists and the Americans for "active coexistence" and "comprehensive merger." The Washington ruling clique has openly advocated: "To inject Western principles, Western styles, and Western tastes into the Soviet Union" to "influence the changes within the Soviet Union." The Soviet revisionists' big push for the international tourism industry is precisely in line with this need of American imperialism. Those Western "guests," whether they are American millionaires who have sucked the blood of the working people and have big bellies, or fascist executioners and reactionary bureaucratic politicians with blood-stained hands, are precisely the messengers of spreading "Western principles," and are warmly received by the Soviet revisionists and treated as honored guests.

When promoting the "International Tourism Year," Soviet revisionist newspapers also boast about showing "fresh and interesting things" to their foreign guests. What are these so-called "fresh and interesting things"? Listen to what a "tourist" has to say. Not long ago, a Japanese reporter mentioned in a report that when he visited the Moscow National Economic Exhibition, a young man hurriedly came up and asked him in English: "I am here to buy dollars from you... how much money do you want, I will give you double the price." This scene immediately gave the Japanese reporter the "illusion of being in his own country."

From this, it can be seen that the "fresh and interesting" things of the Soviet revisionists are nothing more than brightly lit nightclubs, strange and exotic clothing, bustling pawnshops, dollar dealers, police who suppress the masses, and prostitutes who sell their souls and bodies. These things will undoubtedly make tourists from New York, London, Paris, or Tokyo feel interesting, but for them, they are nothing new. If there is anything fresh, it is that in this country called "socialism," one can smell such a strong capitalist stench.

### “新鲜有趣”在哪里？

　　“新鲜有趣”在哪里？
　　赵自
    恩格斯说过：“在资产阶级看来，世界上没有一样东西不是为了金钱而存在的，连他们本身也不例外，因为他们活着就是为了赚钱……”
    苏联现代修正主义的老爷们，也已经堕落成为这种唯利是图、生财有道的资产阶级商人了。最近几年，苏修在经济上困难重重。为了捞取外汇，他们除了在国内大设外汇商店，大赚美元、英镑、法郎、马克外，还在西欧市场上抛售大量黄金，甚至拍卖祖传古董。
    但是尽管如此，仍然堵不住苏修集团经济的漏洞。因此，他们又挖空心思，绞尽脑汁，大做游览生意，想通过招揽西方游客来捞取大量外汇。据苏修报刊报道，苏联已宣布一九六七年为“国际旅行年”，“世界各国将有无数客人”到苏联去旅行。为了接待即将到来的大约一百五十万外国旅行者，苏联几个大城市正在大兴土木，修建什么汽车旅馆，野外旅馆之类。根据《莫斯科真理报》和《列宁旗帜报》的介绍，莫斯科已新建了四千五百个房间，共八千一百个床位的旅馆，市中心的旅馆面积大约将增加一倍。与此同时，正在加紧培养大批的
  “招待工作专家”，他们将向“所有准备到首都来的人们”说：“亲爱的朋友，欢迎光临大庆之年的莫斯科！”
    一九六七年原是伟大的十月社会主义革命的五十周年。现在苏修集团居然利用这个节日来大做广告，招徕顾客，真是可悲又可叹。通过这件事情，勃列日涅夫与柯西金这些打着“马列主义”、“共产主义”旗号的叛徒的嘴脸，不是暴露得一清二楚了吗？
    当然，问题还不仅仅如此。所谓“国际旅行年”，说穿了，不过是苏美之间“积极共处”“全面合流”的一笔肮脏的政治交易。华盛顿统治集团曾公开鼓吹：“将西方的原则、西方的风格和西方的趣味灌输到苏联去”，以“影响苏联内部的演变”。苏修大搞国际旅行事业正是适应了美帝国主义这种需要。那些西方“客人”不管是吸饱了劳动人民血汗、大腹便便的美国百万富翁，或是双手沾满了革命人民鲜血的法西斯刽子手和反动官僚政客，正是充当了这种传播“西方原则”的使者，受到苏修的热情款待，被奉为上宾。
    苏修报刊在宣传“国际旅行年”时，还在大肆吹嘘要“给自己的外国客人看些新鲜有趣的东西”。这种所谓“新鲜有趣”的东西究竟是什么呢？请听听一位“游客”的观感吧。不久以前，一个日本记者在一篇访问记中谈到，他去参观莫斯科国民经济展览会时，一个青年急急忙忙地走过来，用英语问他：“我是来向你买美元的，……要多少钱给多少钱。按牌价的两倍怎么样？”这种情景，不禁使这位日本记者马上产生了“象在日本本国似的错觉”。
    由此看来，苏修的“新鲜有趣”事儿，无非是灯红酒绿的夜总会，奇装异服的衣饰，生意兴隆的当铺，买卖美元的掮客，镇压群众的警察，出卖灵魂和肉体的“应召女郎”之类的货色而已。
    这些玩意儿无疑是会使那些来自纽约、伦敦、巴黎或东京的游客感到有趣的，不过对于他们来说，却一点也不新鲜。如果说有什么新鲜的话，那就是在这个名为“社会主义”的国家里，却可以嗅到如此浓厚的资本主义的臭味罢了。
