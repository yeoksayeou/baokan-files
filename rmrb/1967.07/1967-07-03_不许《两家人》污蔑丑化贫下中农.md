The reactionary film "Two Families" was directed and written by individuals who, in order to cater to the political needs of China's Khrushchev in his attempt to restore capitalism, racked their brains and exerted great effort to create on the silver screen the image of a self-sufficient farmer who amasses wealth and walks the capitalist road, a "good man" named Gao Zhengguo.

Gao Zhengguo is a miser who reeks of the stench of money, a living embodiment of the "three horses, one plow, one cart" rich peasant that China's Khrushchev has long advocated. Gao Zhengguo tells his daughter, "This year is 1953. I plan to store 2,000 bushels of grain, tie up a cow cart, and raise two pigs. By spring of 1954, I plan to have Xiaohai come to our house for a wedding, and then open a large flour mill with the Chen family. By 1955, I will buy ten acres of land and hire two helpers... Within ten years, we will set up a large farm." Is this a simple plan? No! This is a blueprint for the restoration of capitalism.

To realize this blueprint for the restoration of capitalism, the directors and writers have adorned this stubborn capitalist with halo after halo, attempting to win the sympathy and admiration of the people.

One halo is portraying Gao Zhengguo as an "old poor peasant," an "active participant in land reform," a "model in drought resistance," and a "flag-bearer of production." However, if we place him under the mirror of Mao Zedong Thought, it is not difficult to see that this is all deceitful nonsense! Chairman Mao teaches us: Poor peasants are the most enthusiastic about collectivization. If Gao Zhengguo were truly an "old poor peasant" and an "active participant in land reform," then why, under the leadership of the Party, after he gained his freedom and received land and a house, did he not want to follow the Party? Why is he so eager to enrich himself individually and draw up such a capitalist restoration "plan"? Why does he firmly oppose collectivization, and upon hearing about the establishment of a commune in the street, does he become so nervous that he almost knocks over his stall, and then goes home and lies in bed? Why does he resist the Party's policies and not sell his surplus grain to the state? Why does he buy land, lend money, and exploit poor and lower-middle peasants?

Gao Zhengguo is not an "old poor peasant" or an "active participant" at all. Instead, he is a rich peasant who wears the cloak of a poor peasant but engages in the activities of the exploiting class. He is the black flag of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party who is restoring capitalism in the countryside, a black "model."

Another halo is Gao Zhengguo's "hard work and thrift." The film uses numerous shots to praise Gao Zhengguo's spirit of hard work and thrift in his individual farming. Several close-up shots emphasize Gao Zhengguo pulling a cow cart and his family's frugal life. It is not difficult to see that the directors and writers want to use these scenes to tell the audience: Gao Zhengguo's wealth is not obtained through exploitation but through his own hard work like a cow, plus frugality such as "cooking with oil cans" and "washing with salt cans," which makes the number of circles on his savings book increase, making him the richest person in the village. Therefore, anyone who wants land, cows, and carts, and wants to become rich, should work hard like Gao Zhengguo in individual farming. If they put in effort and realize a few "five-year plans," they can become millionaires. The film fervently advocates "individual farming is good" and promotes the extremely reactionary theory of the exploiting class's so-called "labor makes wealth." This is of the same ilk as the theory of "exploitation is meritorious" advocated by the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party.

The film, in order to beautify Gao Zhengguo, who became wealthy through individual farming, goes to great lengths to slander and vilify poor and lower-middle peasants. Look, how energetic Gao Zhengguo is on the path of individual farming! He has added cows, bought carts, and his pigs and chickens are fat and happy, with his family's situation becoming more prosperous day by day. While the poor and lower-middle peasants who join the mutual aid team have furrowed brows and listless spirits, their situation becomes more desolate day by day, and they cannot live without borrowing grain from Gao Zhengguo. In contrast, Gao Zhengguo is not a "hero" who "defeats" socialism? Moreover, the film also shows that collectivization "pushes him around, left and right, and is not good to him." The directors and writers use a vicious and malicious method here to hint to people: the path of collectivization not only cannot enrich people but also destroys the "happiness" of farmers, and only individual farming can enrich people and is the only way out. This is a malicious slander against the socialist system!

The reactionary film "Two Families" openly advocates China's Khrushchev's fallacy of "three independences and one contract" to promote individual farming, and it blows a black wind of restoring capitalism. The directors and writers of the film and China's Khrushchev are in perfect harmony. They attempt to establish Gao Zhengguo as a typical example of walking the capitalist road, to raise this black flag, and to cultivate a large number of rich peasants and farm owners like Gao Zhengguo. Their goal is to drag China back to the old society filled with disasters. This is absolutely impossible! We must take up the thousand-jin hammer of Mao Zedong Thought and smash the black flag of restoring capitalism in the countryside raised by "Two Families"!

　　不许《两家人》污蔑丑化贫下中农
　　河北北京师范学院  东方红“千钧棒”战斗队
    反动影片《两家人》的编导者，为了适应中国的赫鲁晓夫复辟资本主义的政治需要，搜肠刮肚，煞费苦心，在银幕上塑造了一个单干发家的能手、走资本主义道路的“好汉”高正国的形象。
    高正国是一个散发着铜臭味的“守财奴”，是中国赫鲁晓夫早就鼓吹的“三马一犁一车式”富农的活典型。高正国对他女儿说：“今年是五三年，我想存粮两千，拴上一辆牛车，养上两口猪。到五四年春天，我想招小海来咱家上门，再和陈家开个大粉坊。到五五年我就买上十亩地，再请上两个帮工……用不上十年，咱就下手办个大农庄。”这难道是一个简单的计划吗？不！这是一个资本主义复辟的蓝图。
    为了实现复辟资本主义的蓝图，编导者给这个顽固地走资本主义道路的活典型加上了一道道的光圈，企图赢得人们的同情和向往。
    一道光圈是把高正国打扮成“老贫农”，“土改时的积极分子”，“抗旱的模范”，“生产的一杆旗”。但是，只要把他放在毛泽东思想这面照妖镜下，就不难看出这完全是骗人的鬼话！毛主席教导我们：贫农对于合作化最积极。如果高正国真是“老贫农”、“土改时的积极分子”，那么，为什么在党的领导下，他翻了身，分了房分了地，就不愿意跟党走了呢？为什么他那样热中于个人发家致富，订出那样的资本主义复辟的“计划”？他为什么坚决反对合作化，在大街上一听说办社，就紧张得几乎把小摊子都要撞倒了，一回去就卧床不起？为什么他抗拒党的政策，有余粮不卖给国家？为什么他买地放债剥削贫下中农？
    高正国根本不是什么“老贫农”、“积极分子”，而是一个披着贫下中农外衣、干着剥削阶级勾当的富农分子，是党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派在农村复辟资本主义的一杆黑旗，一个黑“模范”。
    另一道光圈，是高正国“苦扒苦拽”“省吃俭用”。影片用了大量的镜头对高正国“苦扒苦拽”的单干发家精神极力加以赞扬，几次用特写镜头渲染高正国拉牛车的动作和高正国一家“省吃俭用”的生活。不难看出，编导者就是要通过这些场面告诉观众：高正国的发家不是剥削来的，而是全靠自己象牛一样地“苦扒苦拽”，加上“油罐烤火”、“盐罐洗澡”这样的节俭，才使他存折上的葡萄圈圈越来越多，才使他成了全村的首富；因此，谁要想有地、有牛、有车，想发家致富，就得象高正国那样“苦扒苦拽”地单干，倘若用把劲，实现几个“五年计划”，就可以成为百万富翁。影片狂热地鼓吹“单干好”，宣扬反动透顶的剥削阶级的所谓“劳动发家”论。这和党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派的“剥削有功”论是一路货色。
    影片为了美化“单干发家”的高正国，千方百计污蔑和丑化贫下中农。你看，高正国在单干的道路上走得多“带劲”啊！添了牛，买了车，猪肥鸡欢，家境日益兴旺。而参加互助组的贫下中农却愁眉苦脸，没精打采，家境日益萧条，非借高正国的粮就不能生活。相形之下，高正国不是成了“战胜”社会主义的“英雄”了吗？而且，影片还表现合作化对高正国“左一下，右一下，跟他过不去”。编导者在这里用阴险毒辣的手法，向人们暗示：合作化道路不但不能富裕，相反还破坏了农民的“幸福”，而只有单干，才能富裕，才是唯一的出路。这完全是对社会主义制度的恶毒诬蔑！
    反动影片《两家人》公然鼓吹中国的赫鲁晓夫“三自一包”搞单干的谬论，大刮复辟资本主义的黑风，影片的编导者和中国的赫鲁晓夫心心相印，他们妄图树立高正国这么一个走资本主义道路典型，打出这么一面黑旗，培植大量象高正国一样的富农和农庄主，其目的就是要把中国拉向灾难深重的旧社会。这一千个办不到，一万个办不到！我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，砸烂《两家人》这面在农村复辟资本主义的黑旗！
