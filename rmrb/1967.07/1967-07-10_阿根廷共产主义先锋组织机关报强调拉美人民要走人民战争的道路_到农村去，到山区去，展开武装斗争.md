The official newspaper of the Argentine Communist Vanguard Organization, "El Combatiente," published an article enthusiastically hailing the thriving patriotic armed struggles of the Latin American people.

The article states: "The leader of the world's revolutionary people, Comrade Mao Zedong, said: 'Without an army of the people, there is nothing for the people.' The Latin American people have begun to understand this truth. They are not afraid of strong enemies and dare to fight."

The article continues: "In the course of their struggles, the Latin American people have come to understand that the enemy relies on state power and the army to maintain their rule. Therefore, 'without power, the people cannot achieve their liberation, and to seize power, one must destroy the armed forces of the reactionaries. The masses are increasingly clear: 'Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun.'"

The article says: "Our enemies are the murderers of the people of various countries, and among them, American imperialism plays the role of an international police force. When the people rise up in rebellion, they carry out large-scale massacres. The exploited masses of Latin America have come to understand this truth from their own experiences, so they easily understand that since the counterrevolution is armed, one must carry out an armed revolution, resolutely take up arms, and eliminate exploitation and poverty."

The article further states: "The people of Asia, Africa, and Latin America are increasingly understanding that in terms of tactics, one should pay attention to the enemy. The path to take is in the countryside, in the mountains, and in the forests to strengthen one's forces, from there to wage a protracted war, encircle the cities to ultimately seize the cities, establish political, economic, and military people's power in the liberated areas, let the masses liberate themselves, and consolidate this victory after achieving it."

The article emphasizes: "Experience has proven that revolutionaries who use Mao Zedong Thought can achieve victory, and if they deviate from Mao Zedong Thought, they will suffer defeat." The article says: "Despite this, establishing the leadership of Mao Zedong Thought requires a serious struggle. Even within the ranks of revolutionaries, there are often deviations from this contemporary Marxism-Leninism, such as: not distinguishing stages in a dependent country's revolution; seizing cities too early; pursuing a purely military line while neglecting Marxism-Leninism revolutionary thought; not believing in the strength of the armed broad masses of peasants, and relying solely on a small number of armed fighters."

The article says: "Those who promote these tendencies are the pseudo-revolutionaries who, under the banner of armed struggle, attempt to delay the process of the masses grasping Mao Zedong Thought. They oppose the establishment of a new type of Marxist-Leninist party. In the revolutionary ranks, if the proletariat does not occupy the position, the bourgeoisie will. If Mao Zedong Thought does not take command, revisionism will spread. Where there is no struggle to establish a new type of Marxist-Leninist party, there will be a revisionist party that will eventually betray the people's struggle." The article points out that these pseudo-revolutionaries cannot achieve their goals because the soldiers influenced by this ideology "will learn from failures in the practice of armed struggle and ultimately follow the path of people's war pointed out by Comrade Mao Zedong."

　　阿根廷共产主义先锋组织机关报强调拉美人民要走人民战争的道路
　　到农村去，到山区去，展开武装斗争
    据新华社讯　阿根廷共产主义先锋组织机关报《不妥协报》发表文章，热情欢呼拉丁美洲人民爱国武装斗争的蓬勃发展。
    文章说：“全世界革命人民的领袖毛泽东同志说：‘没有一个人民的军队，便没有人民的一切。’拉丁美洲人民已经开始懂得这个真理，他们不畏强敌，敢于战斗。”文章接着指出：拉丁美洲人民在斗争中懂得，敌人是依靠国家政权和军队来维持自己的统治的，因此，“没有政权，人民便不能取得自己的解放，而要取得政权，就必须消灭反动派的武装起来的手臂。群众越来越清楚：‘枪杆子里面出政权’。”
    文章说：我们的敌人是杀害各国人民的凶手，在他们中间，美帝国主义起着国际宪兵的作用。人民起来造反，他们就大规模屠杀。“拉丁美洲被剥削群众已从切身经历中认识到这一真理，因此他们很容易懂得，既然反革命是有武装的，那么就必须进行武装革命，坚决地拿起武器，来消灭剥削和贫困。”
    文章接着说：亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民日益懂得，在战术上应该重视敌人。“应该走的道路是在农村、在山区、在森林中壮大自己的力量，从那里开展长期战争，包围城市以便最后夺取城市，在解放区建立政治、经济和军事的人民政权，让群众自己解放自己，并在取得胜利后巩固这一胜利。”
    文章强调指出：“经验证明，革命者用毛泽东思想就能走向胜利，如果一旦背离毛泽东思想就要遭到失败。”文章说：“尽管如此，确立毛泽东思想的领导，是要经过严重的斗争的。甚至在革命者的队伍里，也常常出现违背这个当代马克思列宁主义的思想，例如：在一个附属国革命不分阶段；过早地夺取城市；推行单纯的军事路线而忽视马克思列宁主义的革命思想；不相信武装起来的广大农民群众的力量，而把一切都寄托在武装少数战斗人员上面。”
    文章说：“助长这种倾向的，是那些假革命者，他们打着武装斗争的旗帜，企图推迟群众掌握毛泽东思想的过程，他们反对建立新型的马克思列宁主义的党。在革命队伍中，无产阶级不占领阵地，资产阶级就要去占领，毛泽东思想不挂帅，修正主义就要泛滥。那里不为建立一个新型的马克思列宁主义的党而斗争，那里就会出现迟早会把人民斗争出卖掉的修正主义的党。”文章指出，这些假革命者没法达到他们的目的，因为受这种思想影响的战士“在武装斗争的实践过程中，会从失败当中学习，最终会走上毛泽东同志指出的人民战争的道路”。
