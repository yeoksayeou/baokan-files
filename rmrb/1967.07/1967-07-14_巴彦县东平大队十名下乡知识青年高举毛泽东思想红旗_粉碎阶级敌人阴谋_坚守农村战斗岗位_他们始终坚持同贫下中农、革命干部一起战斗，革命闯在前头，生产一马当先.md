Ten down-to-county youths in Dongping Brigade of Bayan County, Heilongjiang Province, have been holding high the red banner of Mao Zedong Thought in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They have smashed the plots of class enemies and firmly guarded their posts in the countryside. They have always insisted on fighting side by side with poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, taking the lead in revolution and production.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report from Harbin on July 13, ten down-to-county youths in Dongping Brigade of Lincheng Commune, Bayan County, Heilongjiang Province, have, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, seen through the schemes of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who incited and lured them. They have always insisted on uniting with the local poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres to make revolution on the spot. They have followed Chairman Mao's great directive of "grasp revolution, promote production" and, on the battlefield of the countryside, have been the vanguards of revolution and models of production. They have won the praise of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres.

Soon after the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the countryside of Bayan County got underway, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in the locality, in collusion with local landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, stirred up a whirlwind of evil, inciting some down-to-county youths to leave the countryside and go to the city for "linking up." They even gave each of them 300 yuan. Some down-to-county youths in neighboring places, having been deceived, kept coming to Dongping Brigade to find these ten youths to "link up" with, urging them to leave the countryside and go back to the city to find other jobs.

Should they stay in the countryside and fight side by side with the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants to make revolution on the spot, or should they leave the countryside and go back to the city? The ten youths in Dongping Brigade pondered over this question and studied the works of Chairman Mao. The great leader Chairman Mao taught: "How do we judge whether a young person is a revolutionary or not? How do we tell? There is only one criterion, that is, whether he is willing to integrate himself with the broad masses of workers and peasants or not. If he is willing and really does so, he is a revolutionary; otherwise he is not a revolutionary, or he is an anti-revolutionary." Chairman Mao's teachings enabled them to see the direction and realize that whether they insisted on making revolution on the spot in the countryside or not, and whether they could share weal and woe with the poor and lower-middle peasants in this fierce struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, was a big question of being a revolutionary or not. Ma Caixia, a down-to-county youth and an active element in studying the works of Chairman Mao, said: "The revolution and production in the countryside need us, and the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants hope that we will stay in the countryside and fight side by side with them forever. If we cannot withstand this whirlwind of evil, we will be captured by the sugar-coated bullets of the class enemy, which is most despicable." The ten down-to-county youths cleared away their selfish thoughts, firmly decided to throw themselves into the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the countryside, and won the welcome and support of the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants in Dongping Brigade.

These ten down-to-county youths who insisted on guarding their posts in the countryside are vanguards of revolution. When the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the countryside had just begun, they organized a propaganda team for the thoughts of Mao Zedong and, in various forms, propagated the Sixteen Articles, using the great thoughts of Mao Zedong to organize, educate, and arm the masses. They took the lead in exposing a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and struggling against landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists who had not been reformed. The homes of these ten youths became the activity center of the revolutionary masses in the whole brigade. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party in the locality and the landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists regarded them as thorns in their eyes and tried every means to suppress them. The revolutionary youths, following Chairman Mao's teaching of "resolving to fight, not fearing sacrifice, surmounting all difficulties, and striving for victory," overcame various obstacles and finally ignited the blazing flames of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in Dongping Brigade. When the reactionary line of "striking down a big batch and protecting a small handful" put forward by the No. 1 capitalist-roader within the Party appeared here, they, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, studied Chairman Mao's directives on the cadre question, studied the Sixteen Articles and related articles and editorials in newspapers and periodicals, distinguished between two kinds of contradictions of different natures, correctly handled the cadre question, and grasped the general direction of the struggle.

The ten youths kept Chairman Mao's directive of "grasp revolution, promote production" in mind and took the lead in production. Wherever the work was heavy and dirty, they appeared. They took the lead in digging frozen manure; they rushed to go out as laborers to build a reservoir; during the preparation for spring plowing, some cadres lay down and would not work, and they stepped forward to organize the commune members to insist on production. The poor and lower-middle peasants praised them as good youths of Chairman Mao.

    巴彦县东平大队十名下乡知识青年高举毛泽东思想红旗
    粉碎阶级敌人阴谋　坚守农村战斗岗位
    他们始终坚持同贫下中农、革命干部一起战斗，革命闯在前头，生产一马当先
    据新华社哈尔滨十三日电　黑龙江省巴彦县临城公社东平大队十名下乡知识青年，在无产阶级文化大革命中，识破党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派煽动、利诱他们的阴谋，始终坚持和当地贫下中农、革命干部相结合，就地闹革命。他们遵照毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，在农村的战斗岗位上，当抓革命的闯将，促生产的模范，受到广大贫下中农和革命干部的赞扬。巴彦县农村无产阶级文化大革命兴起不久，当地党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派便伙同地、富、反，坏、右分子，刮起了一股邪风，煽动一些下乡知识青年离开农村进城
  “串连”，并发给每人三百元钱。附近地方一些下乡知识青年受了蒙蔽，也不断来到东平大队找这十名青年串连，鼓动他们离开农村，一块回城市另找工作。
    是在农村坚守岗位和广大贫下中农一起就地闹革命，还是离开农村回城市？东平大队的十名知识青年带着这个问题，学习了毛主席著作。伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“看一个青年是不是革命的，拿什么做标准呢？拿什么去辨别他呢？只有一个标准，这就是看他愿意不愿意、并且实行不实行和广大的工农群众结合在一块。愿意并且实行和工农结合的，是革命的，否则就是不革命的，或者是反革命的。”毛主席的教导，使他们认清了方向，认识到坚持不坚持在农村“就地闹革命”，能不能和贫下中农在这场两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的激烈斗争中同呼吸、共命运，是个革命不革命的大问题。下乡知识青年、学习毛主席著作积极分子马彩霞说：“农村的革命和生产都需要我们，广大贫下中农更希望我们永远在农村和他们战斗在一起。如果我们顶不住这股邪风，就是在阶级敌人糖衣炮弹的进攻面前当俘虏，这是最可鄙的。”十名下乡知识青年破除了私心杂念，坚定了在农村投入文化大革命的决心，得到了东平大队广大贫下中农的欢迎和支持。
    这十名坚持农村战斗岗位的下乡知识青年，是革命的闯将。当农村文化大革命刚刚开始，他们就组成毛泽东思想宣传队，用各种形式宣传十六条，用伟大的毛泽东思想去组织群众、教育群众、武装群众。他们带头揭发党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，斗争没有改造好的地、富、反、坏、右分子。这十名知识青年的住处，成了全大队革命群众活动的中心。当地党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和地、富、反、坏、右分子把他们看成眼中钉，千方百计地要把他们压下去。革命小将按着毛主席“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利”的教导，克服了种种阻力，终于点燃起了东平大队文化大革命的熊熊烈火。当党内头号走资本主义道路当权派提出的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线在这里出现的时候，他们又和贫下中农一起学习毛主席关于干部问题的指示，学习十六条和报刊上的有关文章、社论，区分两类不同性质的矛盾，正确对待干部，掌握了斗争的大方向。
    十名小将牢记毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的指示，生产上一马当先，哪里的活重活脏，他们就出现在哪里：刨冻粪，他们带头干；出民工修水库，他们抢着去；备耕中有的干部躺倒不干了，他们挺身出来组织社员坚持生产。贫下中农赞扬他们是毛主席的好青年。
