The All-China Seamen's Union National Committee today cabled the Hong Kong Seamen's Union Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee, firmly supporting the just struggle of Hong Kong Chinese seamen. It solemnly declared that any ship that disrupts the Hong Kong Chinese seamen's boycott movement will be met with necessary resistance and struggle from workers at our coastal ports.

The support telegram said, the "Open Letter to Chinese Seamen" issued by Hong Kong Chinese seamen on July 17 is excellent, truly excellent. It is a new declaration of war by Hong Kong Chinese seamen against British imperialism. We, all Chinese seamen and port workers, firmly support your just struggle and pay the highest revolutionary combat salute to our brave fighting Hong Kong seamen brothers!

The telegram said, the evil British imperialists have brutally persecuted and massacred workers and patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon, committing heinous crimes. Recently, they have even more frantically armed attacks, searches, and disruptions of progressive unions in Hong Kong and Kowloon, arrested striking workers, and even deployed regular British troops to suppress our unarmed patriots. This is intolerable! Chinese seamen and port workers cannot stand idly by while our class brothers and patriots are harmed by the British executioners. We are determined, together with the working class of the entire country, to be the backbone of Hong Kong and Kowloon workers and patriots, to fight side by side with you until final victory.

To this end, we solemnly declare that from now on, any ship that refuses to carry out the notice of the Hong Kong Seamen's Union Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee and disrupts the Hong Kong Chinese seamen's boycott movement will be met with necessary resistance and struggle from workers at our coastal ports.

The telegram said, for more than a hundred years, the heinous crimes committed by British imperialists against workers and patriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon must now be settled.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "What is a real wall of copper and iron? It is the masses, the hundreds of millions who truly and sincerely support revolution. This is a real wall of copper and iron, which no force can break through, which absolutely no force can break through. The counter-revolutionaries cannot break through us, but we will break through the counter-revolutionaries." We firmly believe that Hong Kong Chinese seamen brothers, with their glorious revolutionary fighting tradition, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, united as one, together with workers in Hong Kong and Kowloon, united with patriots, with the support of seven hundred million compatriots in the motherland, will persist in the struggle, advance bravely, and give a heavy blow to the enemy, and will surely achieve a thorough victory in the anti-British, anti-violence struggle.

    中国海员工会全国委员会致电香港海员工会
    坚决支持香港中国海员的正义斗争
    郑重宣告：凡是破坏香港中国海员的抵制运动的轮船，我沿海港口职工将给予必要的抵制和斗争
    新华社十八日讯　中国海员工会全国委员会今天打电报给香港海员工会反对港英迫害斗争委员会，坚决支持香港中国海员的正义斗争，并且郑重宣告：凡是破坏香港中国海员的抵制运动的轮船，我沿海港口职工将给予必要的抵制和斗争。
    中国海员工会全国委员会的支持电说，香港中国海员七月十七日发表的《告中国海员书》好得很，好极了。它是香港中国海员弟兄向英帝国主义的新的讨伐令。我们全体中国海员和港口工人坚决支持你们的正义斗争，并向英勇战斗的香港海员弟兄致以最崇高的革命战斗敬礼！
    支持电说，万恶的英帝国主义，对我港九工人和爱国同胞进行了残酷迫害和血腥屠杀，犯下了滔天罪行。最近它更加疯狂地武装袭击、搜查、破坏港九进步工会，逮捕罢工工人，甚至出动正规英军镇压我手无寸铁的爱国同胞。是可忍，孰不可忍！全中国海员、港口工人决不能坐视自己的阶级弟兄和爱国同胞遭受港英刽子手的残害，决心和全国工人阶级一道誓作港九工人和爱国同胞的后盾，同你们并肩战斗，直到彻底的胜利。
    为此，我们郑重宣告，从即日起，凡是拒绝执行香港海员工会反对港英迫害斗争委员会的通知，破坏香港中国海员的抵制运动的轮船，我沿海港口职工将给予必要的抵制和斗争。
    支持电说，一百多年来，英帝国主义对港九工人和爱国同胞所犯下的滔天罪行，现在到了总清算的时候了。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们说：“真正的铜墙铁壁是什么？是群众，是千百万真心实意地拥护革命的群众。这是真正的铜墙铁壁，什么力量也打不破的，完全打不破的。反革命打不破我们，我们却要打破反革命。”我们深信，具有光荣的革命斗争传统的香港中国海员弟兄，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，团结一致，同港九工人一起，联合爱国同胞，在七亿祖国亲人的支持下，坚持斗争，前赴后继，狠狠地打击敌人，就一定能够取得反英抗暴斗争的彻底胜利。
