Our great leader Chairman Mao enjoys extremely high prestige throughout the world. Revolutionary peoples of various countries deeply revere Chairman Mao and have boundless love for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. They regard Chairman Mao as the "helmsman of the world revolution," the "savior of mankind," and the "red sun in their hearts." They consider Mao Zedong Thought as the compass of revolution, the weapon of struggle, the source of strength, and the banner of victory. In various countries around the world, more and more people are striving to study the works of Chairman Mao and arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought.

Our Chinese seafarers, who sail the seas of the world, have extensive contact with the peoples of various countries. They have personally witnessed the deep reverence and affection that the peoples of various countries have for Chairman Mao. Below are some of their moving experiences.

Whenever a Chinese ship flying the five-star red flag arrives at a port in a foreign country, it is always warmly welcomed by the local people. Many foreign friends, unable to communicate due to language barriers, often raise their thumbs and shout "Mao Zedong" to express their sincere and deep feelings for the Chinese people and the great leader Chairman Mao.

Seafarers in various parts of the world often hear people shouting the great name of Chairman Mao. Once, Chinese seafarers arrived in Yemen and passed through a village. It happened to be a festival day, and the entire village brought out various fruits to entertain them. The children surrounded the seafarers, jumping and shouting, "Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong!"

Some seafarers also had similar touching scenes in Venice, Italy. They went from the port to the city center to sightsee but did not know the way. An Italian worker, knowing they were seafarers from New China, eagerly offered to guide them. After leading them to the station, he still did not want to leave. As they parted, he firmly grasped the hand of the Chinese seafarer and said with deep emotion, "Your Mao Zedong is truly great!" As the seafarers entered the city, many locals saw them and also shouted, "Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong!" A seafarer who had personally experienced this told the reporter, "This famous city attracts thousands of tourists from various countries, but why do the local laborers here treat Chinese seafarers so warmly? From their strong emotions when shouting 'Mao Zedong,' it is clear that it is the great name 'Mao Zedong' that tightly binds the Chinese people and the Italian laborers together."

A Chinese ocean-going ship docked at the port of Djibouti in Ethiopia. The local dock workers boarded the ship, requesting to see a portrait of Chairman Mao. The seafarers took out a copy of "People's Pictorial" and showed it to them. The more they looked, the more excited they became, shouting, "Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong!" and unwilling to leave for a long time.

The peoples of various countries express their reverence and love for Chairman Mao in various ways. In Japan, many people saw the portrait of Chairman Mao on a Chinese ship and ran to it, raising their hands and shouting, "Long live Chairman Mao!" In Somalia, an African friend told our seafarers that he had named his child "Beijing." When the Chinese seafarers asked why he liked this name, he replied, "Beijing has Mao Zedong."

Many people in various countries, out of their love for our great leader, eagerly request badges of Chairman Mao from Chinese seafarers. In Nagoya, Japan, many Japanese workers asked Chinese seafarers for badges of Chairman Mao. After receiving them, some immediately pinned them on their chests and joyfully said, "Today is the happiest day of my life!" Others carefully wrapped the badges in a handkerchief and said to the Chinese seafarers, "I will take this back to give to my child, so he will always remember that the Chinese people are our closest friends." In the port of Yokohama, a stevedore saw a badge of Chairman Mao on a Chinese seafarer's chest and eagerly requested, "Give me a badge of Chairman Mao, so I can always see the red sun in the hearts of the Japanese people."

In some countries ruled by revisionist cliques, people often approach Chinese seafarers at the risk of being persecuted, expressing their love for Chairman Mao and their friendship with the Chinese people. A friend from an Eastern European country asked a Chinese seafarer for a Chinese commemorative stamp. Looking at the portrait of Chairman Mao on the stamp, he said excitedly, "I believe in Mao Zedong, Mao Zedong represents the hope of mankind!"

Our seafarers have personally seen people in various parts of the world eagerly studying the works of Chairman Mao, seeking revolutionary truth from them.

In the port of Antwerp, Belgium, a young porter told Chinese seafarers that he was a university student who had been expelled from school for supporting the Marxist-Leninist line of the Belgian Communist Party leader, Grivas. He thought of Chairman Mao's teachings that young students must revolutionize and go to the masses of workers and peasants, uniting with them. Thus, he decided to become a dock worker. This university student said he loved to read Chairman Mao's books the most and was most concerned about the situation in China. He asked us to lend him a few issues of "Beijing Weekly." That day, he worked on the ship until midnight. After finishing work, he took the magazine away. The next morning at six o'clock, before starting work, he returned the "Beijing Weekly" and happily said, "Last night, I read these magazines in one breath, although I didn't sleep, but today I have more energy." He expressed his determination to study Chairman Mao's works well and master Mao Zedong Thought.

The boundless love of the peoples of various countries for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought deeply moved and inspired our seafarers. They said, "Imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries in various countries are spreading rumors and slanders, attempting to damage the high prestige of our great leader Chairman Mao among the revolutionary peoples of the world and obstruct the spread of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought throughout the world. This is all in vain. Mao Zedong Thought will certainly be mastered by more and more revolutionary peoples of various countries. The brilliance of Mao Zedong Thought will surely illuminate the entire world."

    伟大的名字把世界革命人民联结在一起
    我国远洋海员畅谈各国人民对毛主席的无限敬仰和热爱
    本报讯　我们伟大的领袖毛主席在全世界享有极崇高的威信。各国革命人民无限敬仰毛主席，无限热爱战无不胜的毛泽东思想。他们把毛主席看作是“世界革命的舵手”、“人类的救星”、“心中的红太阳”。他们把毛泽东思想看作是革命的指针，战斗的武器，力量的源泉，胜利的旗帜。在世界各国，越来越多的人努力学习毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想来武装自己。
    航行在世界各地的我国远洋海员，同各国人民进行广泛的接触，他们亲自看到了各国人民对毛主席的这种无比深厚的崇敬和爱戴的感情。下面是他们所经历的一些动人的事例。
    每当挂着五星红旗的我国轮船到达一个国家的港口，总是受到当地人民的热情欢迎。许多外国朋友因为语言不通，不能同中国海员们交谈，往往竖起大拇指，高呼“毛泽东”，来表达他们对中国人民和伟大领袖毛主席的真挚而深厚的感情。
    海员们在世界各地，都可以听到人们高呼毛主席的伟大名字。有一次，我国的海员到了也门，路过一个村庄，那天正好是节日，全村老少都端出各种水果来招待他们。孩子们把海员们围了起来，不停地跳跃和欢呼：“毛泽东，毛泽东！”
    一些海员在意大利的威尼斯也有过同样动人的情景。他们从港口到市内去观光，不认识路。一位意大利工人知道他们是新中国的海员，就热情地要给他们带路。他把中国海员们带到车站后还不肯走。临别时，他紧握住中国海员的手，语重心长地说：“你们的毛泽东真好啊！”海员们进入市区，当地的许多市民看到他们，也纷纷高呼：“毛泽东，毛泽东！”一位曾经亲历其境的海员对记者说：“这座名城来自各国的游客成千成万，为什么这里的劳动人民对中国的海员特别友好呢？从他们高呼‘毛泽东’时表现出来的强烈感情，就可以明白，是‘毛泽东’这个伟大的名字，把中国人民和意大利劳动人民紧紧地联结在一起。”
    我国的一艘远洋轮船停泊在埃塞俄比亚的吉布提港，当地的码头工人拥上轮船，要求看一看毛主席像。海员们把《人民画报》拿出来翻给他们看。他们越看越兴奋，不停地喊：“毛泽东，毛泽东！”久久不愿离去。
    各国人民用各种方法来表达他们对毛主席的崇敬和热爱。在日本，许多人看到中国轮船上挂着毛主席像，就跑到毛主席像前，举手高呼：“毛主席万岁！”在索马里，一位非洲朋友告诉我国的海员，他给自己的孩子起了一个叫做“北京”的名字。中国海员问他为什么喜欢这个名字，他回答说：“北京有毛泽东。”
    许多国家的人民，出于对我们伟大领袖的热爱，争向中国海员索取毛主席像章。在日本的名古屋，许多日本工人跟中国海员要毛主席像章。他们得到以后，有的立即别在胸前，兴高采烈地说：“今天是我最幸福的日子！”有的用手帕把像章小心包好，对中国海员说：“我要拿回去给我的孩子，让他永远记住，中国人民是我们最亲密的朋友。”在横滨港，有一位装卸工人看到中国海员胸前挂着毛主席像章，就热烈请求说：“送给我一个毛主席像章吧，让我时刻看到日本人民心中的红太阳。”
    在一些修正主义统治集团统治的国家，人们也常常冒着受迫害的危险，接近中国海员，表示他们对毛主席的热爱和对中国人民的友谊。一位东欧国家的朋友向中国海员要了一张中国的纪念邮票，他看着画面上的毛主席像激动地说：“我相信毛泽东，毛泽东代表人类的希望！”
    我国海员们在世界各地亲眼看到人们热心地学习毛主席著作，从中寻求革命的真理。
    在比利时安特卫普港，一位年青的搬运工人告诉中国的海员，他是个大学生，因为拥护比共领导人格里巴的马列主义路线，被学校开除了。他想到毛主席的教导，青年学生要革命，必须到工农群众中去，同工农群众结合在一块。于是，他就下定决心，当个码头工人。这位大学生说，他最爱读毛主席的书，最关心中国的情况。他要求我们借给他几本《北京周报》。这一天，他在船上干活，一直到深夜十二点钟。收工以后，才把杂志拿走。第二天早上六点钟，他在上工以前，就把《北京周报》送还，并且高兴地说：“昨晚我一口气把这几本杂志看完了，虽然没有睡觉，但是今天的劲头更大了。”他表示一定要好好学习毛主席的著作，努力掌握毛泽东思想。
    各国人民对毛主席和毛泽东思想的无限热爱，使我国海员深受感动和鼓舞。他们说：“帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派极力造谣诽谤，妄图损害我们伟大领袖毛主席在世界革命人民当中的崇高威望，阻挡战无不胜的毛泽东思想在全世界的传播，这完全是枉费心机的。毛泽东思想必将为世界各国越来越多的革命人民所掌握。毛泽东思想的光辉一定要把全世界照得通红。”
