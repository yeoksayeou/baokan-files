The Soviet revisionist clique once again played a trick of false support and true betrayal. In the UN General Assembly's "emergency meeting," they colluded with the U.S. imperialists to force Arab countries to accept humiliating conditions. Some Arab countries and Asian-African countries voted against the proposal plotted by the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists.

According to a Xinhua News Agency report on the 22nd, New York: The Soviet revisionist leaders closely colluded with U.S. imperialism, staging a farce of "emergency discussion" on the Middle East issue at the United Nations, which ended hastily on the 21st. In this farce, the Soviet revisionist leaders once again played the shameful role of great traitors who betrayed the interests of the revolutionary people of the world.

The emergency meeting of the UN General Assembly, proposed by the Soviet revisionists, dragged on for more than a month, but in the end, no resolution was passed to condemn the U.S. imperialists and their tool, Israel, for launching armed aggression against Arab countries, nor was any resolution passed to demand the withdrawal of the Israeli invading forces that are still occupying large tracts of Arab land. Moreover, during this meeting, the U.S. and the Soviet Union conspired to force Arab countries to accept humiliating conditions.

This emergency meeting of the UN General Assembly further exposed the Soviet revisionist clique's ugly face of false support and true betrayal of the Arab people. Initially, the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin, under the pretext of participating in the emergency meeting of the UN General Assembly, went to the United States to engage in a counter-revolutionary global collusion with the U.S. imperialist leader Johnson. After Kosygin's performance of "condemning" Israel's aggression at the UN, he went to hold secret talks with Johnson. After Kosygin's secret meeting with Johnson, the Soviet revisionists at the UN supported the proposal put forward by the Yugoslav Tito traitor clique, no longer condemning Israel as the aggressor. After Kosygin left the U.S., Gromyko continued intense backstage activities with Rusk and Goldberg in New York.

On the 19th, U.S. Secretary of State Rusk emphasized that the Middle East issue should be resolved through "quiet" work at the Security Council table and behind the scenes. On the same day, Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko held talks with U.S. Representative to the United Nations Goldberg in New York. In the afternoon and evening of the 20th, the Soviet Ambassador to the U.S. held consecutive talks with Goldberg. After the U.S.-Soviet backstage conspiracy, the majority manipulated by the U.S. and the Soviet Union passed a proposal at the UN General Assembly on the 21st, stipulating that the emergency meeting of the UN General Assembly be adjourned and the Middle East issue be handed over to the Security Council, so that the U.S. and the Soviet Union could continue to control the Security Council to support and indulge the Israeli aggressors, conspiring to force Arab countries to accept humiliating conditions.

When the proposal supported by the U.S. and the Soviet Union was put to a vote, Albania, some Arab countries, and some Asian-African countries voted against it. Arab country representatives pointed out in their speeches that the UN General Assembly had neither condemned the aggressors nor demanded the withdrawal of the Israeli aggressors, and passing such a proposal was only to cover up the fact that the assembly had not achieved any real results. Some African country representatives pointed out that this proposal was a "great power conspiracy to impose their rule on small countries" and a confirmation of Israel's occupation of Arab country territories.

According to Western news agencies, by the eve of the adjournment of the assembly, Gromyko and others had reached a deal in their talks with Goldberg, preparing to come up with a plan to use the withdrawal of Israeli aggressors as a condition to force Arab countries to recognize the existence of the U.S. imperialist tool Israel and to guarantee the end of the state of war with Israel. Western news agencies reported that Gromyko had exerted all his efforts to make Arab countries accept this plan, but encountered opposition from some Arab countries. This is how the plan conspired by the U.S. and the Soviet Union was not formally put forward at the UN.

    苏修集团又一次玩弄假支持真出卖阴谋
    在联大“紧急会议”同美帝合谋迫使阿拉伯国家接受屈辱条件
    一些阿拉伯国家和亚非国家投票反对美帝苏修策划的提案
    据新华社二十二日讯　纽约消息：苏修领导集团同美帝国主义紧密勾结，在联合国演出的一出“紧急讨论”中东问题的丑剧，在二十一日草草收场。在这场丑剧中，苏修领导集团又一次扮演了出卖世界革命人民利益的大叛徒的可耻角色。
    苏修建议召开的这次联合国大会紧急会议，断断续续举行了一个多月，结果既没有通过任何决议谴责向阿拉伯国家发动武装侵略的美帝国主义及其工具以色列，也没有通过任何决议要目前仍然霸占着阿拉伯国家大片领土的以色列侵略军队撤走。而且，在这次会议期间，苏美密谋企图迫使阿拉伯国家接受丧权辱国的条件。
    这次联大紧急会议，进一步暴露了苏修集团对阿拉伯人民假支持、真出卖的丑恶面目。苏修头目柯西金当初打着参加联大紧急会议的旗号去美国，实际是去同美帝头子约翰逊进行反革命全球性大勾结。柯西金在联大装腔作势“谴责”以色列侵略一番以后，就去同约翰逊举行秘密会谈。在柯西金同约翰逊举行黑会以后，苏修在联大就支持南斯拉夫铁托叛徒集团搞出的提案，根本不再谴责以色列为侵略者。柯西金离美后，葛罗米柯在纽约同腊斯克、戈德堡等人继续进行紧张的幕后活动。
    美国国务卿腊斯克在十九日强调，中东问题要通过安理会的桌面上以及幕后进行“悄悄的”工作。当天，苏联外交部长葛罗米柯就在纽约同美国驻联合国代表戈德堡举行会谈。二十日下午和晚间，苏联驻美国大使又同戈德堡连续举行会谈。在美苏幕后密谋以后，美苏操纵的多数在二十一日联合国大会上通过提案，规定联大紧急会议休会，而把中东问题转交给安理会，好让美苏继续挟持安理会，来支持和纵容以色列侵略者，阴谋迫使阿拉伯国家接受丧权辱国的条件。
    在美苏支持的这个提案提付表决时，阿尔巴尼亚、一些阿拉伯国家和一些亚非国家投票反对。阿拉伯国家代表在发言中指出，联合国大会既没有谴责侵略者，也没有要以色列侵略者撤走，通过这样一个提案，不过是为了掩饰大会没有能够取得任何实际结果。一些非洲国家代表指出，这个提案是“大国勾结起来蓄意要把它们的统治强加于小国”，是肯定以色列侵占阿拉伯国家领土的现状。
    据西方通讯社透露，到大会休会前夕，葛罗米柯等在同戈德堡的会谈中已经达成交易，准备搞出一个方案，用以色列侵略者撤军为条件，来迫使阿拉伯国家承认美帝侵略工具以色列的存在，并且保证结束同以色列的战争状态。西方通讯社消息说，葛罗米柯曾经竭尽全力展开活动，企图使阿拉伯国家接受这个方案，但是遭到一些阿拉伯国家反对。这样才使得美苏合谋的这个方案最后没有在联大正式抛出来。
