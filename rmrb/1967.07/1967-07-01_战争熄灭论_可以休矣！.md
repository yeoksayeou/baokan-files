The Theory of War Extinction Can Be Put to Rest!

Eight years ago, after Khrushchev's meeting with Eisenhower at Camp David, he vigorously advocated for a "world without war." Now, after Kosygin's enthusiastic embrace with Johnson in Glassboro, he is also boastfully shouting about stopping wars everywhere and making war a thing of the past worldwide. Two traitors, one tune; Kosygin truly deserves to be called a loyal disciple of Khrushchev.

Today's world is a world shrouded in smoke. On one hand, imperialism led by the United States is waging wars of aggression and armed intervention everywhere; on the other hand, oppressed nations and peoples are taking up arms to fight against imperialist aggression and to wage just wars for national independence and liberation. Compared to eight years ago, revolutionary wars and counter-revolutionary wars in the world have not decreased but increased. This is a manifestation of the sharpening of international class struggle and a sign of the excellent situation of world revolution. At such a time, Kosygin is shouting about "stopping wars." What is his real intention?

U.S. imperialism is the main force of aggression and war in the world, the backer of all reactionary forces worldwide, and the root cause of all the big and small wars in the world today. The Soviet revisionists, together with U.S. imperialism, have just turned the anti-aggression war of the Arab people into a "thing of the past." Kosygin hurriedly rushed to conspire with the head of U.S. imperialism, Johnson, on global "U.S.-Soviet cooperation." Once their dirty deal is sealed, Kosygin immediately promotes this "theory of war extinction." This makes it very clear that his so-called "stopping wars" is to spread the "successful" experience of U.S.-Soviet collusion in the Middle East to the whole world. In other words, the Soviet revisionists and U.S. imperialists want to strengthen their cooperation to extinguish the flames of revolutionary struggles of the peoples of the world, thereby achieving the "world peace" they need.

However, Kosygin's "wishful thinking" is doomed to fail.

Khrushchev, in pursuit of a "world without war," did not hesitate to betray the interests of the revolutionary peoples of the world and formed a joint "fire brigade" with U.S. imperialism to suppress the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of various countries. But what was the result? From Vietnam in Asia to Congo (Kinshasa) in Africa to the Dominican Republic in Latin America, the flames of anti-aggression wars and national liberation wars were not extinguished but burned even more fiercely. Kosygin, inheriting Khrushchev's tattered legacy, is striving to strengthen the counter-revolutionary alliance with U.S. imperialism. Can he stop the historical wheel of world revolution?

War is the highest form of class struggle. Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun. From Khrushchev to Kosygin, they blur the distinction between revolutionary wars and counter-revolutionary wars, oppose all wars, and advocate the "theory of war extinction." This is the most thorough betrayal of Marxism-Leninism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has said: War will ultimately be eliminated. "But the method of eliminating it is only one, that is, to use war to oppose war, to use revolutionary war to oppose counter-revolutionary war, to use national revolutionary war to oppose national counter-revolutionary war, to use class revolutionary war to oppose class counter-revolutionary war." The era when war becomes a thing of the past will definitely come, but this can only be after all the demons and ghosts, including the likes of Kosygin, are completely eliminated.

### “战争熄灭论”可以休矣！

　　“战争熄灭论”可以休矣！
    八年以前，赫鲁晓夫在戴维营同艾森豪威尔会谈之后，拚命鼓吹所谓“没有战争的世界”。现在，柯西金同约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗热烈拥抱之后，也得意忘形地大喊什么要世界各地都“停止战争”，“战争应该在全世界成为一件过去的事情”。两个叛徒，一个腔调，柯西金真不愧为赫鲁晓夫的忠实门徒。
    今天的世界，是一个硝烟弥漫的世界。一方面，以美国为首的帝国主义到处进行侵略战争和武装干涉；另一方面，被压迫民族和被压迫人民纷纷拿起武器，展开反对帝国主义侵略、争取民族独立和解放的正义战争。比起八年以前来，世界上的革命战争和反革命战争不是更少了，而是更多了。这是国际阶级斗争更加尖锐化的表现，是世界革命形势大好的表现。在这样的时候，柯西金竟然叫嚷什么“停止战争”，他安的究竟是什么心眼？
    美帝国主义是世界上主要的侵略和战争势力，是全世界反动势力的总后台，是引起当前世界上大大小小战争的总根子。苏修集团刚刚伙同美帝国主义把阿拉伯人民的反侵略战争变成“过去的事情”，柯西金就急急忙忙地跑去同美帝国主义的头子约翰逊密谋全球范围的“美苏合作”。他们的肮脏交易一拍板，柯西金马上鼓吹这种“战争熄灭论”。这就很清楚，他的所谓“停止战争”，就是要把美苏在中东事件中的“成功”经验推广到全世界去。换句话说，苏修和美帝要加紧合作，扑灭世界人民的革命斗争火焰，以实现它们所需要的那种“世界和平”。
    但是，柯西金的“如意算盘”是注定要破产的。
    赫鲁晓夫为了追求“没有战争的世界”，不惜出卖世界革命人民的利益，同美帝国主义共同组成了联合“灭火队”，镇压各国人民的革命斗争。但是，结果怎么样呢？从亚洲的越南，到非洲的刚果（金），到拉丁美洲的多米尼加，反侵略战争和民族解放战争的火焰并没有被扑灭，而是越燃越旺。柯西金继承赫鲁晓夫的破烂衣钵，竭力加强同美帝国主义的反革命联盟，难道就阻挡得住世界人民革命的历史车轮？
    战争是阶级斗争的最高形式。枪杆子里面出政权。从赫鲁晓夫到柯西金，抹煞革命战争和反革命战争的区别，反对一切战争，鼓吹“战争熄灭论”。这是对马克思列宁主义最彻底的背叛。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说过：战争终究要消灭的。“但是消灭它的方法只有一个，就是用战争反对战争，用革命战争反对反革命战争，用民族革命战争反对民族反革命战争，用阶级革命战争反对阶级反革命战争。”战争成为过去的事情的时代是一定要到来的，但是这只能是在包括柯西金之流在内的一切妖魔鬼怪通通被消灭之后。
