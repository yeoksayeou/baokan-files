Black Americans in Detroit Take Up Arms to Revolt
Machine Guns Sweep Fascist Police and Military
Poor Whites Fight Side by Side with Blacks
Johnson Panics, Sends Over Ten Thousand Police to Suppress, Then Rushes in Five Thousand Paratroopers

According to a report from the New China News Agency on the 25th, in Washington: In the fifth-largest city in the United States, Detroit, thousands of black people broke through the heavy encirclement of over thirteen thousand armed police and military on the 24th, expanding the intense anti-violence struggle that had begun from the early hours of the 23rd from west to the entire city. In the flames of anti-violence set by black people, entire blocks of houses and shops belonging to white capitalists, as well as several police stations, were reduced to ashes. Black snipers retaliated against the rampaging police and military with denser bullets. Some black youth even used machine guns for the first time in the battle to sweep the fascist police and military. All this caused great panic among the American ruling class. Johnson ruthlessly announced in the late night of the 24th that he authorized the Department of Defense to "take all necessary measures" to "restore" law and order in Detroit, while also ordering five thousand federal paratroopers to enter Detroit to strengthen the suppression.

On the night of the 24th, eight thousand "National Guard" soldiers, under the cover of tanks and armored vehicles, joined five thousand armed police to carry out a brutal siege of the black people who had risen up against violence. They mounted heavy machine guns on patrol cars, indiscriminately spraying bullets, and also deployed helicopters to assist in the battle. However, the black people were not intimidated. They completely ignored the curfew orders, continuing to surge onto the streets to engage in incredibly brave battles, while also launching more extensive sniper activities. That night, three police stations were separately attacked by snipers, forcing the usually arrogant police to hide indoors and dare not go out. Some black youth even mounted machine guns on trucks and drove onto the streets to shoot at the enemy. The fire and sniping spread to even broader areas. Thick smoke billowed, and the sounds of gunfire and explosions echoed in the night sky.

As the anti-violence struggle of black people developed, the assembly lines of the three largest automobile factories in the United States completely stopped. Shops, banks, and restaurants were all closed. Schools were all suspended.

In this large-scale class struggle against violence, a large number of poor whites fought side by side with black brothers. By midnight on the 24th, the brave and tenacious black people had put over thirteen thousand armed police and military at a clear disadvantage. Governor Romney exclaimed that the situation was even more serious than the previous night. It was against this background that Johnson announced new measures to further suppress black people in Detroit on television. He anxiously admitted that the situation in Detroit was "rapidly deteriorating" and that "clear and indisputable evidence" showed that local officials were no longer able to control the situation. The two paratrooper brigades, totaling five thousand, which had been hastily airlifted from other states to the Detroit suburban airport earlier that day, also entered the city according to Johnson's orders to participate in the suppression.

This anti-violence struggle was triggered by the police raiding a small bar in the black neighborhood in the early hours of the 23rd, arbitrarily arresting dozens of black people. Hundreds of black people rushed to the scene upon hearing the news, throwing stones and bricks at the rampaging police. A large number of police rushed to reinforce, attempting to forcibly disperse the black crowd. However, the black crowd continued to gather, reaching a peak of thousands of people on the streets. Amidst the thick smoke of tear gas, they charged forward, using stones, bricks, glass bottles, and homemade Molotov cocktails to drive the fully armed police and military into retreat. Black snipers also fired from rooftops and porches. After a day and night of continuous battle, most of the city had turned into a battlefield. Black people used homemade Molotov cocktails to set countless fires of revenge; in some areas, entire blocks of streets turned into seas of fire. The fire lit up the sky, and thick smoke rose, even visible from across the river in Canada.

The wave of black people's anti-violence self-defense struggles in the United States has forced the American ruling class to be busy fending off and in a state of disarray. The picture shows black people in Detroit fighting with fully armed police and military.

    美国黑人在底特律拿起武器造反
    架起机枪愤怒扫射法西斯军警　穷苦白人同黑人并肩战斗
    约翰逊大为惊慌出动万余军警镇压不了又赶忙增派五千空降部队
    据新华社二十五日讯  华盛顿消息：美国第五大城市底特律市数千黑人群众，二十四日冲破一万三千多名武装军警的重重包围，把从二十三日凌晨开始的如火如荼的抗暴斗争由西向东扩展到了整个市区。在黑人群众点燃的抗暴烈火中，成片成片属于白人资本家的房屋和商店以及数处警察所烧成了灰烬；黑人狙击手以更密集的子弹狠狠惩罚逞凶的军警；部分黑人青年在战斗中还第一次使用机枪向法西斯军警愤怒地扫射。这一切使美国统治集团大为惊慌，约翰逊悍然在二十四日深夜宣布，授权国防部“采取一切必要措施”来“恢复”底特律的“法律和秩序”，同时还下令把联邦空降部队五千人开进底特律加强镇压。
    二十四日晚间，八千名“国民警卫队”士兵在坦克和装甲车掩护下，配合五千名武装警察，对奋起抗暴的黑人群众实行残酷的围剿。他们在巡逻车上架起重机枪，任意扫射，并且出动直升飞机助战。但是黑人群众并没有被吓倒。他们丝毫不理睬宵禁的命令，继续涌上街头进行无比英勇的战斗，同时，还展开了更加广泛的狙击活动。在这一晚就有三处警察所分别遭到狙击手的袭击，打得平日作威作福的警察龟缩在屋子里不敢外出。一些黑人青年还把机枪架在卡车上冲上大街扫射敌人。大火和狙击不断向更广阔的地区蔓延。浓烟滚滚，枪声、爆炸声在夜空中回响。
    随着黑人抗暴斗争的发展，美国三家最大的汽车工厂的装配线完全停顿。市内商店、银行、饭店已全部关门。学校全部停课。
    在这场大规模的抗暴的阶级斗争中，有大批穷苦白人同黑人弟兄亲密无间地并肩战斗。到二十四日午夜时分，英勇顽强的黑人群众使一万三千名武装军警陷入了明显的劣势。州长罗姆尼惊呼，局势甚至比前一晚更加严重。就在这种背景下，约翰逊在电视广播中宣布了进一步镇压底特律黑人的新措施。他不安地承认，底特律的局势在“迅速恶化”，“清楚而无可争辩的证据表明，当地官员已无法控制局势”。在当天早些时候才分别由其他州匆匆空运到底特律市郊飞机场的两个空降旅共五千人，这时也根据约翰逊的命令开进市区参加镇压。
    这次抗暴斗争是由于警察在二十三日凌晨闯进黑人区一家小酒店，无端逮捕数十名黑人引起的。数百名黑人群众闻讯赶来，向逞凶的警察愤怒投掷石块和砖头。大批警察赶来增援，妄图把黑人群众强行驱散。但黑人群众越聚越多，最高潮时，有数千群众涌上街头，冒着催泪性瓦斯的浓烟向前冲，并且用石块、砖瓦、玻璃瓶、自制燃烧瓶等把全副武装的军警打得抱头鼠窜，落荒而逃。黑人狙击手还从屋顶上、门廊下向警察瞄准射击。战斗在持续进行一昼夜之后，整个市区的大部分地区都变成了战场。黑人用自制燃烧瓶点燃了无数起复仇的烈焰；有的地段，甚至成片成片的街区变成了火海。火光映红了天空，浓烟冲天，甚至从隔河相望的加拿大境内都可清楚看见。
