Over 50,000 revolutionary masses from Shatoujiao, New Territories, and Shenzhen held a memorial service today to honor Zhang Tiansheng, a martyr who was killed by British imperialists on July 8 while supporting the just struggle of compatriots in Hong Kong and Kowloon against British oppression. Meanwhile, over 6,000 people in the Shenzhen area also held a memorial meeting.

Participants entered the venue with flowers, expressing their reverence. Leaders from Ba'anan County, local troops, militia from Shatoujiao Town, Red Guards, and revolutionary masses, along with patriotic compatriots from the New Territories of Hong Kong, denounced the British imperialists' bloody crimes at the meeting. They vowed to carry forward the martyr's legacy and continue the struggle against British oppression to the end.

A cadre from the Shatoujiao Brigade first introduced Zhang Tiansheng, saying he was a lifelong resident of Shatoujiao, a poor peasant from the Shatoujiao Commune, and a 41-year-old veteran militia member. He had personally suffered from the brutal oppression of British imperialism. He loved the collective and labor, was a good member and militia of Chairman Mao, and was very resolute in supporting the struggle of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots against British oppression. Zhang Tiansheng died for the people's interests, heavier than Mount Tai. We must all learn from the martyr's revolutionary spirit.

A representative of our stationed troops, who witnessed the Hong Kong British authorities' massacre of the protesting crowd, angrily said at the meeting that the Hong Kong British authorities' bloody suppression of the protesting crowd was entirely premeditated and planned. When the crowd was still gathering, they dispatched three batches of "riot control teams" to ambush on the road, ready to suppress. As soon as the patriotic compatriots from the New Territories returned to the British territory, they were shot at. The ruthless British bandits also fired at our side, killing Zhang Tiansheng and injuring eight protesters. This was a deliberate attempt to escalate border tensions and a military provocation against our country. If the British imperialists dare to continue their aggression, they will receive double punishment.

The Shatoujiao militia solemnly swore: We will definitely carry forward the martyr's legacy and more resolutely support the just struggle of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots. He angrily said: British imperialists, listen! The Shatoujiao militia armed with Mao Zedong Thought has the heroic spirit to fight to the end with the enemy. We have already made all preparations for the battle, determined not to fear sacrifice, and resolutely fight to the end with the Hong Kong British authorities. We will not rest until we avenge the blood debt!

A representative of the New Territories patriotic compatriots emotionally said that the great people of our motherland and the powerful People's Liberation Army are our strong backing. In the future, we will definitely study Chairman Mao's works more diligently and resolutely fight against British imperialism to the end.

The younger brother of the deceased martyr, Zhang Bao, also spoke at the meeting.

The meeting was filled with a strong atmosphere of demanding blood debt from imperialism. The slogan "Down with British imperialism!" echoed throughout the Shatoujiao area. After the meeting, people formed a queue over a mile long to pay their respects at the martyr's grave.

Over 6,000 people from various circles in Ba'anan County, Shenzhen, also held a memorial meeting today to mourn the martyr Zhang Tiansheng.

A representative of the local troops said at the meeting that the martyr Zhang Tiansheng faced danger without fear and fought to the end, unfortunately sacrificing his life. We must learn from his brave fighting spirit, revolutionary heroism, and his noble qualities of loyalty to the Party, Chairman Mao, and the people, and support the struggle of Hong Kong and Kowloon compatriots against British oppression to the end!

Revolutionary workers, peasants, students, Red Guards, and militia representatives from the Shatoujiao Commune all spoke at the meeting. They angrily condemned the Hong Kong British authorities for ignoring repeated warnings from our government and escalating the bloody suppression of the Shatoujiao protesting crowd.

At the meeting, the masses angrily shouted: "Down with British imperialism!" "Blood debt must be repaid with blood!" Various revolutionary masses and leaders from the Guangzhou Military Region and Guangdong Provincial Military Region also offered wreaths to the martyr.

    沙头角新界深圳五万多人追悼反英抗暴烈士
    革命群众愤怒表示誓同英帝血战到底向英帝讨还血债
    据新华社广州十一日电　沙头角地区革命群众和新界爱国同胞五万多人，今天下午举行追悼会，追悼在七月八日声援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴的正义斗争中，被英帝国主义杀害的张天生烈士。同时，今天在深圳地区也有六千多人举行了追悼大会。
    参加大会的群众怀着崇敬的心情，抬着一列列花圈走进会场。宝安县领导机关、当地驻军、沙头角镇民兵、红卫兵、革命群众代表，以及香港新界地区爱国同胞，在会上纷纷控诉英帝国主义的血腥罪行，表示要继承革命烈士的遗志，将反英抗暴斗争进行到底。
    沙头角大队干部最先介绍说，烈士张天生同志世代居住在沙头角，是沙头角公社贫农社员，四十一岁的老民兵，亲身遭受过英帝国主义的残酷迫害，他热爱集体，热爱劳动，是毛主席的好社员、好民兵，在支持港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争中一直是很坚决的。张天生烈士为人民利益而死，比泰山还重，我们大家要学习烈士的革命精神。
    亲眼看到港英当局屠杀游行群众的我驻军代表在会上愤怒地说，港英当局血腥镇压游行群众完全是有预谋有计划的。当群众还在集会的时候，他们就派了三批“防暴队”埋伏在路上，准备进行镇压。当新界爱国同胞刚刚返回英界的时候就遭到枪击。穷凶极恶的英国强盗还向我方射击，打死张天生，并打伤示威群众八人，这是蓄意加重边境紧张局势，对我国进行的军事挑衅。如果英帝国主义胆敢继续来犯，就给它加倍的惩罚。
    沙头角民兵沉痛地宣誓：一定继承烈士遗志，更坚决地支持港九爱国同胞的正义斗争。他愤怒地说：英帝国主义听着：用毛泽东思想武装起来的沙头角民兵，有同敌人血战到底的英雄气概，我们早已作好一切战斗的准备，下定决心，不怕牺牲，坚决与港英当局血战到底，不讨还血债，誓不罢休！
    新界爱国同胞代表激动地说，伟大的祖国人民、强大的中国人民解放军，是我们坚强的后盾。今后我们一定更好地活学活用毛主席著作，坚决与英帝国主义斗争到底。
    死难烈士的弟弟张保也在会上讲了话。
    会议自始至终充满向帝国主义讨还血债的强烈气氛，“打倒英帝”的口号声响彻整个沙头角地区上空。会后人们排着一里多长的队伍到烈士坟墓献了花圈。
    广东省宝安县深圳地区各界人民群众六千多人今天也举行了追悼大会，沉痛追悼张天生烈士。
    当地驻军代表在会上说，烈士张天生同志临危不惧，坚持斗争，不幸光荣牺牲。我们一定要学习他英勇无畏的战斗精神，学习他革命英雄主义气概，学习他忠于党、忠于毛主席、忠于人民的高尚品质，把支援港九爱国同胞反英抗暴斗争进行到底！
    深圳地区的革命工人、农民、学生、红卫兵小将和沙头角公社民兵连代表都在大会上讲了话。他们愤怒地谴责港英当局不顾我国政府的一再警告，变本加厉地血腥镇压沙头角示威群众的滔天罪行。
    大会上，群众愤怒地高呼：“打倒英帝国主义！”“血债要用血来还！”各界革命群众和广州部队、广东省军区领导机关都向烈士献了花圈。
