	Comrade Ba Den Pa spoke at the capital's memorial meeting for Comrade Liu Yi.
	With the support of 700 million Chinese people,
	The armed struggle in Burma will take a leap forward.
	The people of the capital from all walks of life resolutely declare that they will demand blood debt from the Ne Win reactionary government.

	New China News Agency, July 5th: "Countless martyrs have sacrificed themselves for the people's interests and bravely marched ahead of us. Let us hold high their banners and march forward on their blood-stained path!" Today, more than ten thousand revolutionary masses from all walks of life in the capital, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm, studied the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, and held a memorial meeting for Comrade Liu Yi, who sacrificed his life in the struggle against the fascist atrocities of Burma's Ne Win reactionary government.

	"Down with the Ne Win reactionary government in Burma!" "We will definitely demand blood debt from the Ne Win reactionary government!" The revolutionary masses in the capital expressed their strongest and most indignant protest and condemnation of the Ne Win reactionary government's frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese fascist atrocities at the memorial meeting; they declared that the Chinese people firmly support the Burmese people in their armed struggle under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party, to thoroughly overthrow the Ne Win reactionary government until complete liberation is achieved.

	Members of the Political Bureau of the Communist Party of China Central Committee and Vice Premier of the State Council Li Xiannian, Deputy Director of the Central Cultural Revolution Group Zhang Chunqiao, and members of the Central Cultural Revolution Group Guan Feng and Chen Boda attended the memorial meeting.

	The first deputy chairman of the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party and the leader of the Burmese Communist Party Central Committee delegation, Ba Den Pa, Burmese writer Min La Ye Gon, and Burmese experts Guo Yinggao and Tun Lun, who are working in Beijing, attended the memorial meeting.

	In front of the memorial hall, there was a portrait of Comrade Liu Yi and his urn, with a wreath sent by Comrade Zhou Enlai in front of it, as well as wreaths sent by the Central Cultural Revolution Group and the Burmese Communist Party Central Committee delegation. The wreath sent by Comrade Zhou Enlai read: "In memory of Comrade Liu Yi, who bravely sacrificed his life in the struggle against violence," the wreath sent by the Central Cultural Revolution Group read: "In honor of the revolutionary martyr who sacrificed his life," and the wreath sent by the Burmese Communist Party Central Committee delegation read: "Comrade Liu Yi will live forever."

	Around the memorial hall, large banners read: "Learn from the revolutionary spirit of Comrade Liu Yi and Burmese patriotic overseas Chinese who fearlessly fight against violence, and plant the red flag of revolution all over the world!" "Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and march forward on the blood-stained path of the martyrs!" "Strongly protest against the anti-China and anti-Chinese fascist atrocities of the Ne Win reactionary government in Burma, and blood debt will be repaid with blood!" "Down with the U.S. imperialists! Down with the Soviet revisionists! Down with the Ne Win reactionary government in Burma!"

	After the memorial meeting began, the revolutionary masses in the entire hall held the "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and studied the teachings of our great leader: "To struggle is to sacrifice, and death is a common occurrence. But we think of the people's interests, of the pain of the majority of the people. To die for the people is a worthy death."

	Comrade Li Xiannian presented a wreath to the portrait of Comrade Liu Yi.

	The representative of the unit where Comrade Liu Yi worked before his martyrdom, the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power, delivered a eulogy. The eulogy said that Comrade Liu Yi was a revolutionary warrior of the proletariat nurtured by Mao Zedong Thought and cultivated by the Party for a long time. He was a good son of the Chinese people and a good member of the Communist Party of China. Comrade Liu Yi, in the struggle against the anti-China violence of the Ne Win reactionary government in Burma and in defending our embassy in Burma, showed an indomitable spirit of bravery and fearlessness. This greatly boosted the morale of the Chinese people and struck a heavy blow to the imperialists, revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries; it demonstrated the spirit of revolutionary heroism. Comrade Liu Yi was truly a great internationalist and patriot armed with Mao Zedong Thought, a stalwart of the proletariat, a good young man of the Mao Zedong era, a red overseas aid warrior, and a steadfast revolutionary of the proletariat. Comrade Liu Yi defended the dignity of the motherland with his blood and life, defended the dignity of 700 million Chinese people, and defended the boundless Mao Zedong Thought and the great proletarian cultural revolution. Comrade Liu Yi's death is heavier than Mount Tai.

	The representative of the Foreign Economic Liaison Commission said in his speech that the 700 million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. Johnson, Khrushchev, Sukarno, and the Ne Win reactionary government are all nothing in our eyes. All the anti-China clowns in every corner of the world will meet a bad end! The blood debt owed by the Burmese reactionary government to the Chinese people must be repaid in blood!

	He said that all the warriors on our overseas aid front, after being tempered by this unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution, will definitely hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought and the banner of proletarian internationalism, support all oppressed nations and peoples in the world, thoroughly smash the old world, and create a new world that is red and free from imperialism, capitalism, and exploitation, letting the boundless Mao Zedong Thought illuminate the globe!

	The representative of the Red Guards of the capital's colleges and universities said in his speech that the current era is one where Mao Zedong Thought shines brightly. We warn the Burmese reactionaries: your frenzied anti-China actions will not end well, the more you fight against China, the faster you will perish!

	The representative of the Red Guards said that under the leadership of revolutionary communists, the Burmese people, guided by Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, have bravely carried out a violent revolution against the Ne Win reactionary government. The people's armed forces are continuously growing and developing, and the Burmese reactionaries are already sitting on a volcano of people's war. The Chinese Red Guards resolutely support all revolutionary actions of the Burmese revolutionary communists and revolutionary people! And we express our highest respect for the arduous and unyielding struggle carried out by the Burmese revolutionary communists and revolutionary people! We firmly believe that Burma will belong to the Burmese people, not to the Ne Win reactionaries!

	The representative of the Chinese embassy in Burma said in his speech that the Burmese reactionary government has systematically, organized, and step-by-step carried out frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese actions, committing unprecedented bloody atrocities in the history of international relations. This is a complete exposure of its fascist reactionary nature and its hideous face. The Burmese reactionary government's current frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese actions are aimed at diverting the strong dissatisfaction and resistance of the broad masses of the Burmese people against it; to cater to the needs of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism; to resist the influence of the great Mao Zedong Thought and our proletarian cultural revolution, in an attempt to save its dying fate. This is completely a pipe dream and wishful thinking. The conspiracy of the Burmese reactionary government is absolutely doomed to fail. It can only "lift a stone to drop on its own feet," accelerating its own demise.

	He said that the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party, which holds high the great red banner of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, issued a statement on June 28 regarding the anti-China and anti-Chinese incidents of the Burmese reactionary government, calling on all Burmese people to launch a counterattack and smash the reactionary government's anti-China conspiracy. This statement fully reflects the will of the broad masses of the Burmese people. This statement is excellent. We wholeheartedly support and resolutely endorse it. We will forever stand with the broad masses of the Burmese people, for the decisive, thorough, complete, and clean defeat of the Burmese reactionary government's evil anti-China and anti-Chinese schemes, for the maintenance and development of our fighting friendship, and for the revolutionary cause of the Burmese and world peoples.

	During their speeches, the entire hall continuously shouted: "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet modern revisionism!" "Down with the Ne Win reactionary government!" "The Burmese reactionary government's anti-China actions will not end well!" "Long live the People's Republic of China!" "Long live the Communist Party of China!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

	Comrade Ba Den Pa spoke in the midst of enthusiastic applause, with the title "The Burmese Chiang Kai-shek—The Ne Win military government will definitely be defeated! The people will definitely be victorious!" He said that Comrade Liu Yi established Sino-Burmese friendship with his blood, and the Burmese people will never forget him and will always remember him.

	Comrade Ba Den Pa said that the struggle of Burmese overseas Chinese youth students and overseas Chinese brothers is completely just and correct. Their just struggle will definitely be victorious. The reactionary Ne Win military government will never be able to suppress their just struggle. The Ne Win's masters—the U.S. imperialists and the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, even if they join forces, will not be able to suppress their just struggle. Because they have grasped the great thoughts of the world's great leader—Chairman Mao, their struggle is just; the glorious 700 million Chinese people are with them, and the broad masses of the Burmese people are with them.

	He said that we once again declare that we, the Burmese Communist Party, wholeheartedly support the just struggle of the overseas Chinese and strongly protest against the fascist atrocities of the Ne Win military government in killing overseas Chinese. The blood debt owed by the Ne Win military government must be repaid in blood.

	Comrade Ba Den Pa said that the anti-China actions of the Ne Win military government are not accidental. This incident is a result of the joint plotting and premeditation of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, reactionaries of all countries, and the Kuomintang bandits.

	Comrade Ba Den Pa introduced the situation of the armed struggle led by Chairman De Zhen Dan of the Burmese Communist Party. He said that now we are giving the Ne Win military government a fatal blow. Our guerrilla bases have become more extensive and more consolidated. Our combat areas cover more than 60% of the country's area. Because Ne Win fired the first shot against China, the armed struggle in Burma will definitely take a leap forward and enter a higher stage, because now is the time when the armed struggle in Burma has gained the full sympathy and support of 700 million Chinese people, and the majority of the Burmese people who oppose Ne Win will be more united. The future situation is that the armed struggle in Burma will be more powerful and extensive, and more of Ne Win's army will be annihilated.

	Comrade Ba Den Pa emphasized that we have been able to persist in nearly twenty years of armed struggle because we have taken Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as our guide. The brilliant victories we have achieved in the military are the victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	We have been able to persist in the struggle because we have established Chairman Mao's thought of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," because we have used the gun to oppose the thoughts and programs of China's Khrushchev and the Soviet revisionist leadership clique, who wanted us to cooperate with Ne Win and become Ne Win's disciples.

	He said that although China's Khrushchev does not like us, we still follow Chairman Mao's teachings and insist on self-reliance, carrying out the struggle for more than nineteen years. Our party is now studying Chairman Mao's works and emphasizing the need for everyone to study and apply the works of our beloved Vice Chairman Lin Biao, "Long Live the Victory of People's War."

	Comrade Ba Den Pa exposed the evil plots and various crimes of the Ne Win government in relying on the U.S. and Soviet revisionists to implement fascist rule, pointing out that Ne Win is the Chiang Kai-shek of Burma who implements military dictatorship in Burma.

	Comrade Ba Den Pa said that the Ne Win military government, which opposes the Chinese and Burmese peoples, will definitely be defeated. We will definitely, together with the Chinese people, carry out the struggle against the Ne Win military government, the struggle against revisionism, and the struggle against the reactionaries of all countries to the end. Let us, under the banner of Chairman Mao's thoughts, unite, fight, and win together!

	After Comrade Ba Den Pa's speech, the entire hall erupted in thunderous applause, and people waved their red "Quotations from Chairman Mao," shouting for a long time: "Salute to the Burmese Communist Party, which is bravely carrying out armed struggle!" "The friendship between the peoples of China and Burma is indestructible!" "Firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the Burmese people!" "Ne Win will be defeated! The Burmese Communist Party will be victorious!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Long live! Ten thousand years!"

	Comrade Liu Yi's family member Liu Yaxuan spoke in her speech, strongly condemning the heinous crimes of the Ne Win reactionary government's large-scale anti-China and anti-Chinese actions. She said that the Burmese reactionaries publicly insulted the red sun in the hearts of the Chinese and world peoples, our great leader Chairman Mao, seized our national emblem, killed and injured our overseas aid experts and diplomatic personnel, and carried out inhuman persecution and killing of our overseas Chinese. For this series of fascist atrocities, I express my strongest protest. We must unite with the Burmese people and fight together, giving a heavy blow to the Ne Win reactionary government, and completely eliminating the Burmese reactionaries and all reactionaries.

	Those who attended the memorial meeting also included Albanian Ambassador to China Nataneli, First Secretary of the Vietnamese Embassy in China Ho Ngoc Quynh, Representative of the Permanent Representative Office of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China Le Kim, Chairman of the Malayan National Liberation League's Representative Office in China Shalma, Assistant to the Overseas Representative of the Patriotic Front of Thailand Mong Khong Nana Kong, and others.

	Those who attended today's memorial meeting also included responsible comrades from relevant departments such as Fang Yi, Fu Zuoyi, Han Nianlong, Li Yimang, Chu Tunan, Yang Haolu, Wang Weizhen, Shen Tu, Nie Yuanzi, Kuai Dafu, Wang Dabin, Han Aijing, and former Chinese Ambassador to Burma Deng Xiaoping.

	The memorial meeting ended with the high-spirited "Internationale."

　　德钦巴登顶同志在首都追悼刘逸同志大会上讲话
　　有了七亿中国人民的充分支持
　　缅甸武装斗争将出现飞跃形势
　　首都各界群众坚决表示一定要向奈温反动政府讨还血债
    新华社五日讯　“成千成万的先烈，为着人民的利益，在我们的前头英勇地牺牲了，让我们高举起他们的旗帜，踏着他们的血迹前进吧！”今天，首都各界革命群众一万多人，满怀革命激情，学习伟大领袖毛主席的教导，追悼在反抗缅甸奈温反动政府法西斯暴行斗争中壮烈牺牲的我援缅专家刘逸同志。
    “打倒缅甸奈温反动政府！”“我们一定要向奈温反动政府讨还血债！”首都革命群众在追悼大会上，以无比愤怒的心情，最最强烈抗议和声讨奈温反动政府疯狂反华排华的法西斯暴行；表示中国人民坚决支持缅甸人民在缅共领导下进行武装斗争，大造奈温反动政府的反，直到获得彻底解放。
    中共中央政治局委员、国务院副总理李先念，中央文革小组副组长张春桥，中央文革小组成员关锋、戚本禹等同志，参加了追悼大会。
    正在北京的缅甸共产党中央委员会第一副主席、缅共中央代表团团长德钦巴登顶，缅甸作家敏拉叶贡，在北京工作的缅甸专家郭迎高、吞伦，参加了追悼会。
    在追悼会会场的正前方，放着刘逸同志的遗像和骨灰盒，前面立着周恩来同志送的花圈，以及中央文革小组和缅共中央代表团送的花圈。周恩来同志送的花圈上写道：“献给抗暴斗争中英勇牺牲的刘逸同志”，中央文革小组送的花圈上写道：“向英勇牺牲的红色援外战士致敬”，缅共中央代表团的花圈上写着：“刘逸同志永垂不朽”。
    会场四周高悬着巨幅标语：“学习刘逸烈士和缅甸爱国侨胞不畏强暴、英勇斗争的革命精神，把革命红旗插遍全世界！”“让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，踏着烈士的血迹前进！”“最强烈抗议缅甸奈温反动政府反华排华的法西斯暴行，血债一定要用血来还！”“打倒美帝！打倒苏修！打倒缅甸奈温反动政府！”
    追悼大会开始以后，全场革命群众手捧《毛主席语录》，学习我们伟大领袖的教导：“要奋斗就会有牺牲，死人的事是经常发生的。但是我们想到人民的利益，想到大多数人民的痛苦，我们为人民而死，就是死得其所。”
    李先念同志向刘逸同志遗像献花圈。
    刘逸同志牺牲前在国内工作的单位水利电力部的代表致悼词。悼词中说，刘逸同志是在毛泽东思想哺育下，在党的长期培养下成长起来的无产阶级革命战士，是中国人民的好儿子，是中国共产党的好党员。刘逸烈士在抗拒缅甸奈温反动政府反华暴行和保卫我国驻缅使馆的斗争中，英勇顽强、不怕牺牲的大无畏精神，大长了中国人民的志气，大灭了帝国主义、修正主义和各国反动派的威风；表现了革命英雄主义的气概。刘逸烈士不愧为毛泽东思想武装起来的伟大的国际主义和爱国主义者，不愧为无产阶级的硬骨头，不愧为毛泽东时代的好青年，不愧为红色的援外战士，不愧为坚定的无产阶级革命派。刘逸同志用鲜血和生命捍卫了祖国的尊严，捍卫了七亿中国人民的尊严，捍卫了光焰无际的毛泽东思想和伟大的无产阶级文化大革命运动。刘逸同志的死，比泰山还重。
    对外经济联络委员会代表在讲话中说，用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民不是好惹的，什么约翰逊，什么柯西金，什么苏哈托，都不在我们眼里，你奈温反动政府更不在话下。世界上各个角落里的一切反华小丑通通都没有好下场！缅甸反动政府欠下中国人民的血债，是一定要用血来偿还的！
    他说，我们援外战线上的全体战士，经过这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，更高地举起无产阶级国际主义的旗帜，支援世界上一切被压迫民族和被压迫人民，彻底摧毁旧世界，创造一个没有帝国主义、没有资本主义、没有剥削制度的红彤彤的新世界，让光焰无际的毛泽东思想照亮全球！
    首都大专院校红代会代表在讲话中说，当今的时代是进入了以毛泽东思想为光辉旗帜的伟大时代。我们警告缅甸反动派：你们疯狂反华，决没有好下场，你们反华越凶，灭亡越快！
    红代会代表说，缅甸人民在革命的共产党人的领导下，以马列主义、毛泽东思想作指导，向奈温反动政府进行了英勇的暴力革命，人民武装力量正在不断壮大和发展，缅甸反动派已经坐在人民战争的火山上。中国红卫兵坚决支持缅甸革命共产党人和革命人民的一切革命行动！并对缅甸革命共产党人和革命人民所进行的艰苦卓绝的斗争表示崇高的敬意！我们坚信，缅甸一定是缅甸人民的，决不是奈温反动派的！
    我国驻缅甸大使馆代表在讲话中说，缅甸反动政府有计划、有组织、有步骤地疯狂反华排华，制造了国际关系史上罕见的血腥暴行，这是它的法西斯反动本性的大暴露，是它的狰狞嘴脸的大暴露。缅甸反动政府现在跳出来疯狂反华排华，就是为了转移缅甸广大人民对它的强烈不满和反抗；就是为了迎合美帝国主义和苏联修正主义的需要；就是为了抵制伟大的毛泽东思想和我国无产阶级文化大革命的影响，妄图以此挽救它垂死的命运，这完全是白日作梦，痴心妄想。缅甸反动政府的这种阴谋是绝对不能得逞的。它只能是“搬起石头打自己的脚”，以加速它的灭亡而告终。
    他说，高举马列主义、毛泽东思想伟大红旗的缅甸共产党中央委员会六月二十八日就缅甸反动政府反华排华事件发表声明，号召全体缅甸人民展开针锋相对的斗争，粉碎反动政府的反华阴谋。这个声明充分反映了缅甸广大人民的意志。这个声明好得很。我们衷心拥护，坚决支持。我们将永远同缅甸广大人民一起，为坚决、彻底、全部、干净击垮缅甸反动政府反华排华的罪恶勾当，为维护和发展我们之间的战斗友谊，为缅甸和世界人民的革命事业共同奋斗。
    在他们讲话过程中，全场不断高呼：“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”“打倒奈温反动政府！”“缅甸反动政府反华绝没有好下场！”“中华人民共和国万岁！”“中国共产党万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    德钦巴登顶同志在极为热烈的掌声中，作了题为《缅甸的蒋介石——奈温军人政府必败！人民必胜！》的讲话。他说，刘逸同志以他的鲜血建立起了中缅友谊，缅甸人民是永远不会忘记的，是会永远想念他的。
    德钦巴登顶同志说，缅甸华侨青年学生和华侨兄弟进行的斗争是完全正义的，完全正确的。他们的正义斗争一定胜利。反动的奈温军人政府是绝对压不垮他们的正义斗争的。奈温的主子——美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团联合起来，也是压不垮他们的正义斗争的。因为他们掌握了伟大的世界领袖——毛主席的思想，他们的斗争是正义的；光荣的七亿中国人民和他们在一起，缅甸的广大人民和他们在一起。
    他说，我再一次声明，我们缅甸共产党衷心支持华侨的正义斗争，并且强烈抗议奈温军人政府残杀华侨的法西斯暴行。奈温军人政府欠下的血债必须用血来偿还。
    德钦巴登顶同志说，奈温军人反动政府的反华决不是偶然的。这个事件是美帝国主义、苏联修正主义、各国反动派和国民党匪帮互相勾结，共同策划，事先预谋的一个事件。
    德钦巴登顶同志介绍了以德钦丹东主席为首的缅甸共产党领导下的武装斗争的情况。他说，现在我们正在给奈温军人政府以致命的打击。我们的游击根据地更加扩大了，更加巩固了。我们的战斗地区占全国面积的百分之六十以上。由于奈温开了反华的第一枪，缅甸的武装斗争必将出现飞跃的形势，走向更高的阶段，因为现在的时机是缅甸的武装斗争得到七亿中国人民的充分的同情和支持，反对奈温的绝大多数的缅甸人民将更加团结起来。今后的形势是缅甸的武装斗争将更加发挥它的威力，更加广泛，奈温政府的军队将被消灭得更多。
    德钦巴登顶同志强调说，我们所以能够坚持将近二十年的武装斗争，是由于我们以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为指南。我们在军事上所取得的辉煌胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。
    我们所以能够坚持斗争是由于我们树立了毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的思想，是由于我们使用了枪杆子、反对了中国的赫鲁晓夫和苏修领导集团要我们同奈温合作、并做奈温的门徒的思想和纲领的结果。
    他说，尽管中国的赫鲁晓夫不喜欢我们，我们还是按照毛主席的教导，坚持自力更生，进行了十九年以上的斗争。我党现在正在大学毛主席著作，并且强调要求大家在斗争中活学活用我们敬爱的林彪副主席的著作《人民战争胜利万岁》。
    德钦巴登顶同志揭露了奈温政府投靠美帝、苏修实行法西斯统治的险恶阴谋和种种罪行，指出奈温就是在缅甸实行军事独裁的缅甸的蒋介石。
    德钦巴登顶同志说，反对中国人民和缅甸人民的奈温军人政府必败。我们一定同中国人民一起，把反对奈温军人政府的斗争，把反对修正主义的斗争，把反对各国反动派的斗争进行到底。让我们在毛主席思想的旗帜下，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
    德钦巴登顶同志讲话以后，全场掌声雷动，人们挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，长时间地高呼：“向正在英勇进行武装斗争的缅甸共产党致敬！”“中缅两国人民的友谊是破坏不了的！”“最坚决支持缅甸人民的革命斗争！”“奈温必败！缅共必胜！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！”
    刘逸同志的家属刘亚芸同志在讲话中痛斥奈温反动政府大肆排华反华的滔天罪行。她说，缅甸反动派公然侮辱中国人民和世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳、我们伟大的领袖毛主席，劫走我国国徽，打死打伤我国的援缅专家和外交人员，对我国侨胞进行惨无人道的迫害和杀害，对于这一系列的法西斯暴行，我表示最最强烈的抗议。我们要和缅甸人民团结起来，共同战斗，给缅甸奈温反动政府以狠狠的回击，把缅甸反动派和一切反动派彻底消灭。
    参加追悼会的，还有阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使纳塔奈利，越南驻中国大使馆一等秘书何玉桂，越南南方民族解放阵线常驻中国代表团代表黎金，马来亚民族解放同盟驻中国代表团团长沙尔玛，泰国爱国阵线常驻国外代表助理蒙空·纳那空等。
    参加今天追悼会的，还有各有关方面的负责人方毅、傅作义、韩念龙、李一氓、楚图南、杨浩庐、王唯真、沈图、聂元梓、蒯大富、王大宾、韩爱晶等，以及我国原驻缅甸大使耿飚。
    追悼大会在高昂的《国际歌》声中结束。
