Japanese revolutionary people hold the greatest and deepest affection for the great Chairman Mao. To express their boundless love and respect for Chairman Mao, many laborers and revolutionaries in Japan have hung portraits of Chairman Mao in their homes. People gaze at him every day, yearning for the world revolutionary base – China, and missing the great revolutionary leader Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao enjoys the highest prestige in the hearts of the Japanese revolutionary people.

Not long ago, in a worker's home in the suburbs of Nagoya, as soon as one entered the outer room, a portrait of Chairman Mao was seen hanging on the wall. After the host led us into the bedroom, another portrait of Chairman Mao and a photograph of Chairman Mao were seen hanging on the wall. The host, with boundless revolutionary passion for the great teacher, great leader, great supreme commander, and great helmsman Chairman Mao, proudly told the reporter why his family hung so many portraits of Chairman Mao. He excitedly said, "This way, anyone who comes to my house can see Mao Zedong no matter where they sit. I want to propagate Mao Zedong Thought to everyone."

In a school for the blind in Kanagawa Prefecture, a 17-year-old student named Ozawa has an infinite love for Chairman Mao, praising him as the "greatest proletarian revolutionary" and the "Lenin of our times." He has long wished to obtain a portrait of Chairman Mao to hang in his room.

Ozawa, due to his blindness, cannot write letters in ordinary Japanese characters, so he wrote a letter in Braille (the script used by the blind) to a progressive bookstore in Tokyo. In the letter, he expressed his enthusiasm, saying that he is a listener of Beijing Radio and has already purchased a copy of the Red Book – "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong." Now he also hopes to obtain a portrait of his most respected Chairman Mao.

One morning, his teacher informed Ozawa to pick up his mail, and he immediately realized that it was the portrait of Chairman Mao he had been longing for. He was eating, so he hastily put down his bowl and went to pick up the mail. Sure enough, there was a portrait of Chairman Mao and a Chairman Mao badge. He was so excited that he almost jumped up. Ozawa and two other classmates, with boundless respect, repeatedly touched the portrait of the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, Chairman Mao. Although they are blind and cannot see, they think of the great Chairman Mao and hear the glorious name of Mao Zedong, as if they see him.

With the victory of the Japanese revolutionary people's struggle against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and the profound influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, the Red Book "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" is rapidly spreading across the Japanese archipelago. Now, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought has become the guide for revolutionary people's actions, the weapon of struggle, and the source of strength.

Recently, the reporter visited a worker's home in Osaka. What was touching was that this couple and their son, who is in high school, and their daughter, who is in junior high school, are all striving to study Chairman Mao's works and are actively applying Mao Zedong Thought in their struggles. The hostess revealed and denounced the counter-revolutionary and anti-people crimes of the Japan Communist Party revisionists to the reporter. Originally, the hostess was a member of the "New Japan Women's Association" controlled by the Japan Communist Party revisionists. However, due to the Japan Communist Party revisionists' blatant anti-China actions, obstructing and sabotaging the friendly exchanges between Japanese revolutionary women and Chinese women, and banning the reading of books and publications that propagate Mao Zedong Thought, she became enlightened, saw through the true nature of the Japan Communist Party revisionists, and broke with the "New Japan Women's Association" with other revolutionary women.

In March of this year, after the Japan Communist Party revisionists created the anti-China bloodshed incident at the "Good Neighbor Student Dormitory" in Tokyo, she, together with her comrades-in-arms, distributed leaflets exposing the Japan Communist Party revisionists in residential areas and bravely fought against the obstruction and threats of the Japan Communist Party revisionists.

In the struggle, the shining revolutionary treasure – "Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong" became her sharpest weapon. The hostess said: "In the struggle, 'Quotations from Chairman Mao Zedong' gave me courage and is the source of my strength."

The hostess emphasized: I believe that once Mao Zedong Thought is grasped by the people, the people will rise up to liberate themselves, and all reactionaries will reveal their paper tiger nature.

　　日本革命人民称颂毛主席是当代的列宁
    毛泽东思想是斗争的武器力量的源泉
    据新华社讯　本社记者报道：日本革命人民对伟大的毛主席怀有最真挚、最深厚的感情。为了表达对毛主席的无限热爱、无限崇敬，在日本，有许许多多劳动群众和革命者的家庭悬挂着毛主席像。人们天天仰望着他老人家，心里向往着世界革命根据地——中国，想念着伟大的革命领袖毛主席。毛主席在日本革命人民心中享有最崇高的威信。
    不久以前，在名古屋郊外的工人住宅区一户失业工人的家里，一进门就看见在外屋的墙上贴着一张毛主席的画像。待主人把我们引进卧室里，又看见墙上挂着一张毛主席像片和另外一张毛主席画像。主人怀着对伟大导师、伟大领袖、伟大统帅、伟大舵手毛主席的无限热爱的革命激情，自豪地告诉记者他家里为什么要挂这么多毛主席像。他激动地说，“这样，到我家来的人不管在哪里坐都可以看见毛泽东。我要向所有的人宣传毛泽东思想。”
    在神奈川县一所盲人学校念书的十七岁的学生大泽，无限热爱毛主席，把毛主席称颂为“最伟大的无产阶级革命家”“当代的列宁”，他从很早以前就想得到一张毛主席画像挂在自己房间里。
    大泽由于双目失明，不能用普通的日本文字写信，就用点字（盲人用的文字）给东京一家进步书店写了一封热情洋溢的信。他在信中说，他是北京广播电台的听众，他已经购买了一本红色宝书——《毛主席语录》，现在还希望得到一张他最敬爱的毛主席画像。
    一天早晨，老师通知大泽去领取邮件，他立刻意识到是他日夜盼望的毛主席画像寄来了。他正在吃饭，便匆匆地放下饭碗，去领回邮件。邮件里果然有一幅毛主席画像和一枚毛主席像章，他兴奋得几乎跳起来。大泽同另外两个同学怀着无限崇敬的心情一遍又一遍地抚摸着全世界人民心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席画像。他们虽然双目失明，看不见，但是他们心里想到伟大的毛主席，听见毛泽东这个光辉的名字就仿佛看见了他老人家。
    随着日本革命人民反对帝国主义、修正主义和反动派的斗争的胜利发展以及中国无产阶级文化大革命的巨大影响日益深入人心，红色宝书《毛主席语录》，在日本列岛迅速地传播开来。如今，战无不胜的毛泽东思想已经成为革命人民的行动指南、斗争的武器和力量的源泉。
    最近，记者到大阪一家工人家里作客。令人感动的是这一家夫妻俩和一个在高中读书的儿子、一个在初中读书的小女儿都在努力学习毛主席著作，并且在斗争中努力活学活用毛泽东思想。女主人向记者揭露和控诉了日共修正主义分子的反革命、反人民的无耻罪行。原来，女主人曾经是日共修正主义分子把持的“新日本妇女会”的会员。但是，由于日共修正主义分子明目张胆地大肆反华，阻挠和破坏日本革命妇女同中国妇女的友好往来，禁止阅读宣传毛泽东思想的书刊，使她觉悟起来，看穿了日共修正主义分子的本质。她便同其他革命妇女一起造了日共修正主义分子的反，毅然同“新日本妇女会”决裂。
    今年三月，日共修正主义分子制造了东京“善邻学生会馆”的反华流血事件后，她又同战友们一道深入住宅区散发揭露日共修正主义分子的传单，同日共修正主义分子的阻挠和威胁勇敢地进行了斗争。
    在斗争中，红光闪闪的革命宝书——《毛主席语录》成为她进行斗争的最锐利的武器。女主人说：“在斗争中，《毛主席语录》给了我勇气，是我力量的源泉”。
    女主人强调说：我相信，毛泽东思想一旦被人民群众掌握，人民群众就会起来自己解放自己，一切反动派都会现出纸老虎的原形。
