The youth of Skrapar warmly welcomes the Chinese Red Guards delegation
The youth of China and Albania will forever stand together and fight together

According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, July 5th: The youth of Skrapar, who have made great contributions to the revolutionary movement in Albania, held a grand gathering at the "Migjeni" Theater in Skrapar on the evening of the 3rd to warmly welcome the delegation of Chinese Red Guards led by Comrade Yao Wenyuan to visit Skrapar.

The youth of Skrapar, with a glorious revolutionary tradition, have actively responded to the call of the Labor Party and Comrade Enver Hoxha since the beginning of this year, vigorously combating religious superstition, backward customs, feudal remnants, and bourgeois ideology, and enthusiastically participating in voluntary labor. In the class struggle and productive labor, they have tempered themselves. When their close comrades-in-arms, the Chinese Red Guards, entered the venue, they shouted slogans such as "Enver-Mao Zedong," "People's China," and "Friendship is the guarantee," warmly welcoming the Red Guards sent by Chairman Mao.

Isa Rama, the first secretary of the Skrapar District Labor Youth League, first spoke on behalf of the youth of this district at the meeting. He said: "Today, we have the opportunity to welcome the red warriors of the great leader of the Chinese people, Comrade Mao Zedong, the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and the invited delegates to the Fifth Congress of the Labor Youth League of Albania, which is a great honor for the youth of Skrapar. Please allow me to take this opportunity to represent the youth of the entire district to pay tribute to our comrades and, through them, to the glorious Communist Party of China and Chairman Mao Zedong."

Isa Rama enthusiastically praised the invincible Mao Zedong Thought and the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China.

He expressed that the youth of Albania, educated under the guidance of the Labor Party of Albania, will forever stand with their Chinese comrades in the same trench to fight against imperialism, revisionism, and for the victory of the proletarian revolution.

Isa Rama concluded with the slogans: "Long live the fighting friendship between China and Albania!" "Glory to the great leaders of the peoples of China and Albania, Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha!" "Glory to the Red Guards!"

Isa Rama also, on behalf of the youth of the entire district, presented a banner to the Chinese Red Guards delegation, which read: "The unbreakable friendship between Albania and China will last forever!" Tang Houlan, a member of the Chinese Red Guards delegation, also spoke at the welcoming meeting. Tang Houlan, in her speech, highly praised the high revolutionary spirit and heroic spirit of the Albanian youth under the leadership of the Labor Party of Albania and the great leader of the Albanian people, Comrade Enver Hoxha, who hold a pickaxe in one hand and a gun in the other, actively participating in the socialist revolution and socialist construction. She also expressed her gratitude to the people and youth of Skrapar District for their warm welcome to the Chinese Red Guards delegation, their support for the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the Red Guards movement in China, and their love and evaluation of the great leader Chairman Mao.

Tang Houlan also introduced the unprecedented Chinese Red Guards movement to the youth of Skrapar. At this moment, the entire venue was in an uproar, and the youth enthusiastically shouted: "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" "Enver-Mao Zedong!"

Tang Houlan expressed that the Chinese Red Guards will learn from the revolutionary spirit and labor enthusiasm of the Albanian youth. The youth of China and Albania will forever stand together, fight together, and win together, and will jointly struggle against imperialism led by the United States and modern revisionism centered on the leadership of the CPSU.

The delegation of Chinese Red Guards led by Comrade Yao Wenyuan arrived in Skrapar District on the morning of the 3rd for a friendly visit, accompanied by Akim Mero, the first secretary of the Central Committee of the Labor Youth League of Albania, and Liu Xiao, the Chinese Ambassador to Albania. The delegation received a warm welcome and reception from the people and youth of Skrapar District wherever they went.

The delegation visited the construction site of the "Vau i Dejes" hydroelectric power station in the afternoon of the 3rd. Large banners with slogans written in both Chinese and Albanian were hung on the construction site: "Warmly welcome the Red Guards delegation!" "Salute to the pioneers of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution—the Red Guards!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Albania!"

When the Chinese Red Guards delegation arrived at the construction site, the entire site immediately became excited. Comrade Yao Wenyuan, the leader of the delegation, enthusiastically praised the revolutionary heroism of the Albanian working class during the inspection and wished the hydroelectric power station to be completed ahead of schedule, and wished the Albanian working class to achieve greater successes in revolution and construction.

The Chinese Red Guards delegation visited the "Albania-China Friendship Agricultural Cooperative" in Bushat in the morning of the 4th and received a very warm and friendly reception from the responsible comrades and members of the cooperative. Comrade Yao Wenyuan, the leader of the delegation, specially handed over a letter from all the members of the "Albania-China Friendship People's Commune" in the suburbs of Beijing, entrusted to the delegation, to the chairman of the cooperative. The chairman of the cooperative, on behalf of all the members, enthusiastically accepted this letter full of deep affection from afar and presented a finely crafted handicraft—a pickaxe symbolizing the Albanian people holding a pickaxe in one hand and a gun in the other, bravely fighting—to the Chinese Red Guards delegation. The delegation presented gifts such as embroidered portraits of Chairman Mao and Comrade Enver Hoxha to the cooperative.

During the delegation's visit to Skrapar District, they received enthusiastic receptions from the district's party and government leaders.

The delegation left Skrapar in the afternoon of the 4th, carrying with them the deep affection of the people and youth of Skrapar District for the people and youth of China.

    据新华社地拉那五日电　在阿尔巴尼亚革命化运动中做出了巨大贡献的斯库台市青年，三日晚上在斯库台“米吉安尼”剧院隆重举行盛大集会，热烈欢迎由姚文元同志率领的中国红卫兵代表团访问斯库台市。
    有着光荣革命传统的斯库台青年，今年以来积极响应劳动党和霍查同志的号召，大造宗教迷信、落后习俗、封建残余和资产阶级思想的反，踊跃参加义务劳动，在阶级斗争和生产劳动中得到锻炼。当他们的亲密战友——中国红卫兵进入会场时，他们高呼“恩维尔—毛泽东”“人民中国”和“友谊是保证”等口号，热烈欢迎毛主席派来的红卫兵战士。
    斯库台区劳动青年联盟第一书记伊萨·拉马首先代表这个区的青年在大会上致词。他说：“今天我们有机会欢迎中国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志的红色战士、无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋、应邀参加阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟第五次代表大会的中国红卫兵代表团，这是我们斯库台青年的莫大幸福。请允许我借此机会代表全区青年向我们的战友、并通过他们向光荣的中国共产党和毛泽东主席致敬。”
    伊萨·拉马热烈赞扬了战无不胜的毛泽东思想和史无前例的中国无产阶级文化大革命。
    他表示，在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党教育下的阿尔巴尼亚青年，将永远同自己的中国战友站在反帝、反修和争取无产阶级革命胜利的同一条战壕中。
    伊萨·拉马最后高呼：“中阿战斗友谊万岁！”“光荣属于中阿两国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东同志和恩维尔·霍查同志！”“光荣属于红卫兵！”
    伊萨·拉马还代表全区青年向中国红卫兵代表团赠送了一面锦旗，上面写着：“阿中牢不可破的友谊万古长青！”中国红卫兵代表团团员谭厚兰也在欢迎会上讲了话。谭厚兰在讲话中高度赞扬阿尔巴尼亚青年在阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民的伟大领袖霍查同志的领导下，一手拿镐，一手拿枪，积极参加社会主义革命和社会主义建设的高度革命精神和英雄气概，并且感谢斯库台区人民和青年对中国红卫兵代表团的热烈欢迎，感谢阿尔巴尼亚青年对中国无产阶级文化大革命和红卫兵运动的支持，感谢阿尔巴尼亚人民对伟大领袖毛主席的热爱和评价。
    谭厚兰在讲话中还向斯库台市青年介绍了史无前例的中国红卫兵运动。这时，全场沸腾，青年们热情高呼：“毛泽东！毛泽东！”“恩维尔—毛泽东！”
    谭厚兰表示，中国红卫兵要学习阿尔巴尼亚青年的革命精神和劳动热情。中阿两国青年不论在什么样的情况下都将永远团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，为反对以美国为首的帝国主义和以苏共领导集团为中心的现代修正主义而共同斗争。
    由姚文元同志率领的中国红卫兵代表团是在阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟中央第一书记阿基姆·梅罗和中国驻阿尔巴尼亚大使刘晓的陪同下，在三日上午到达斯库台区进行友好访问的。代表团所到之处都受到斯库台区人民和青年的热烈欢迎和接待。
