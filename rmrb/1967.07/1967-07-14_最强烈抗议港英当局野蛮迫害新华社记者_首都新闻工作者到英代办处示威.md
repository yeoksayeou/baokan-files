Capital news workers protest at the British representative office

According to Xinhua News Agency on the 13th, the Hong Kong British fascist authorities have unreasonably arrested and illegally "interrogated" Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch reporter Xue Ping, and shamelessly persecuted the staff of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch. This has aroused the extreme indignation of the capital's news workers. Today, more than a thousand news workers from the capital gathered in front of the British representative office in China to protest strongly against the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities, demanding that the Hong Kong British authorities immediately release Xue Ping.

The protesters solemnly pointed out that the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities are a serious political provocation against the great Chinese people. They sternly warned the Hong Kong British authorities: they must immediately release the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch reporter Xue Ping, apologize to the victims, and compensate for all losses; they must guarantee the normal business activities and personal safety of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong Branch reporters and staff; they must ensure that similar incidents do not happen again, otherwise, they must bear all the serious consequences that arise from this.

At 10:30 AM, revolutionary workers from the All-China Journalists Association, Xinhua News Agency, People's Daily, Guangming Daily, Beijing Daily, and other news organizations in the capital, holding high portraits of the great leader Chairman Mao and banners, with strong indignation against British imperialism, gathered in front of the British representative office in China to post protest big-character posters and banners, and to protest. They waved the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," repeatedly shouting: "Down with British imperialism!" "Strongly protest the illegal 'interrogation' of Xinhua News Agency reporters by the Hong Kong British authorities!" "British imperialism must immediately release the Chinese reporter!" "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!" "Ten thousand years!"

They read over and over again Chairman Mao's teachings: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. They seem terrifying, but in reality, they have no great power. From a long-term perspective, the true power does not belong to the reactionaries but to the people."

Amidst the angry slogans of "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with British imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism!" and "The Hong Kong British authorities must immediately release Xinhua News Agency reporter Xue Ping!" representatives from various news organizations in the capital handed over a protest letter to the British representative office in China and sternly pointed out to the two diplomatic officials who received the protest letter: The British government must comply with our demands, otherwise, the Chinese news workers armed with Mao Zedong Thought will never agree!

    最强烈抗议港英当局野蛮迫害新华社记者
    首都新闻工作者到英代办处示威
    据新华社十三日讯  香港英国法西斯当局无理逮捕和非法“审讯”新华社香港分社记者薛平，并肆无忌惮地迫害新华社香港分社工作人员，激起了首都新闻工作者的无比愤怒，今天首都新闻界一千多人涌到英国驻中国代办处门前示威，最强烈地抗议港英当局的法西斯暴行，要求港英当局立即释放薛平。
    示威群众严正指出，港英当局这一法西斯暴行，是对伟大中国人民的一个严重的政治挑衅。他们严重警告港英当局：必须立即释放新华社香港分社记者薛平，向受害者道歉，并赔偿一切损失；必须保证新华社香港分社记者和工作人员的正常业务活动和人身安全；保证今后不再发生类似事件，否则，必须承担由此引起的一切严重后果。
    上午十时半，中华全国新闻工作者协会、新华通讯社、人民日报、光明日报、北京日报等首都新闻单位的革命工作人员，高举着全世界人民伟大领袖毛主席像和标语牌，怀着对英帝国主义的强烈愤怒，聚集在英国驻中国代办处门前张贴抗议大字报和标语，进行抗议示威。他们挥动着《毛主席语录》，不断高呼：“打倒英帝国主义！”“强烈抗议港英当局非法‘审讯’新华社记者！”“英帝国主义必须立即释放中国记者！”“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万万岁！”
    他们一遍又一遍地朗读毛主席的教导：“一切反动派都是纸老虎。看起来，反动派的样子是可怕的，但是实际上并没有什么了不起的力量。从长远的观点看问题，真正强大的力量不是属于反动派，而是属于人民。”
    在一片“打倒美帝！打倒英帝！打倒苏修”、“港英当局必须立即释放新华社记者薛平”的愤怒口号声中，首都各新闻单位的代表，向英国驻中国代办处递交了抗议书，并向接受抗议书的英国代办处的两名外交官员严正指出：英国政府对我们的要求必须照办，否则，用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国新闻工作者是决不会答应的！
