The Party committees and leadership organs of the various general departments, military branches, and military regions of the Chinese People's Liberation Army (PLA) firmly support the Central Military Commission's decision to hold a conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the spring of 1968. They call on all units and personnel to take immediate action to launch a new wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, using practical actions to welcome the conference.

In recent days, the General Staff Department, General Political Department, General Logistics Department, and the leadership organs of the Navy, Air Force, Railway Corps, Engineering Corps, Artillery, Second Artillery, Armored Forces, Signal Corps, and Chemical Defense Corps have each held party committee meetings or meetings of direct-subordinate cadres. They have seriously studied and discussed the decision of the Central Military Commission and the notice from the General Political Department. Some have also issued decisions and sent instructions and notices to subordinate units. The Party committees and political organs of the Beijing, Nanjing, Jinan, Chengdu, Lanzhou, Shenyang, Fuzhou, and Wuhan Military Regions, as well as the Inner Mongolia, Xinjiang, and Tibet Military Districts, have each held discussions and required subordinate units to widely publicize the significance of the Central Military Commission's decision to hold this conference, ensuring that it deeply resonates with everyone. The Party committees of the Guangzhou and Kunming Military Regions, after discussion, organized work teams or dispatched leading cadres to go to grassroots units to explain the decision of the Central Military Commission to cadres, soldiers, workers, and family members, and to convey the notice from the General Political Department.

Since the decision of the Central Military Commission and the notice from the General Political Department were issued, the units have been filled with excitement. In the front lines of Fujian, the soldiers of the "Red Spearhead Company" and the "Sea Tiger Boat" are jubilant. Many active learners of Chairman Mao's works have firmly declared that they will redouble their efforts to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, achieve new victories and new labor in defending the motherland and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and welcome the successful convening of the conference. The representatives attending the conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in a certain unit of the Yunnan Military Region and the border guards stationed in the Awa Mountains of Yunnan heard the good news on the radio and declared to Chairman Mao: We will definitely redouble our efforts and study harder, achieve new levels of study and application, and go to Beijing to report our joy to the most beloved and great leader Chairman Mao. The soldiers of the Ta Mountain Hero Regiment guarding the southern gate of the motherland and the soldiers of a certain border unit stationed on the Pamirs Plateau heard the good news and spread it joyfully. They said: This is a great piece of news that boosts morale, and it is the greatest care and encouragement from the Central Military Commission. The political instructor Li Changwan of the company where Liu Yingjun, who is participating in the experience exchange conference on studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" held by the Shenyang Military Region, once served, expressed: We must definitely learn, execute, propagate, and defend Mao Zedong Thought like Liu Yingjun, and in the "Three Supports, Two Militaries" work, we must definitely learn Mao Zedong's revolutionary line without the slightest negligence; execute Mao Zedong's revolutionary line without the slightest deviation; propagate Mao Zedong's revolutionary line without the slightest pause; and defend Mao Zedong's revolutionary line without the slightest wavering.

In studying the decision of the Central Military Commission and the notice from the General Political Department, the broad masses of soldiers unanimously believe that at this moment of great victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the decision by Vice Chairman Lin Biao and the Central Military Commission to hold a conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the PLA is a highly significant event in the history of our military and a great joy for all soldiers and the people of the nation. It is the best call to action and the strongest mobilization order for launching a new wave of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. They joyfully point out that the convening of this conference will have a tremendous driving force for the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in our military, promoting the ideological revolutionization of the troops; at the same time, it will also have a significant impact on the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works nationwide, firmly establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and spreading Mao Zedong Thought worldwide.

In studying the decision of the Central Military Commission and the notice from the General Political Department, many units have also seriously analyzed the new situation of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in their units. They unanimously believe that since Vice Chairman Lin Biao called for raising the study of Chairman Mao's works to a new level last September, the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in the troops has entered a new stage. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers have an infinite love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, always and everywhere insisting on using Mao Zedong Thought as the guiding principle and soul, generally paying attention to breaking private interests and establishing public interests in major issues, and using Mao Zedong Thought to transform their worldview. In the great class struggle of the Cultural Revolution, they have a deeper understanding and more active application of Chairman Mao's works, especially of Chairman Mao's theory, line, policies, and principles on carrying out the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat. Everyone believes that through welcoming the convening of the conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the PLA, we should mobilize the masses to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, summarize and promote the experiences of a large number of advanced units and individuals that have emerged in the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and carry out the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works in our military more broadly and deeply.

To ensure the successful holding of the conference of active learners of Chairman Mao's works in the PLA, the soldiers unanimously expressed that in the future, they will definitely take the implementation of the decision of the Military Commission and the notice from the General Political Department as an important political task, truly placing the organization and leadership of studying Chairman Mao's works in a position that is prior to everything, higher than everything, heavier than everything, and greater than everything. Many leading cadres at the regiment level and above also expressed that in the future, they will definitely study and apply Chairman Mao's works well in the struggle between the two lines, set a good example in transforming their worldview, and set a good example in implementing and defending Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. They will frequently go to the troops to inspect the situation of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, discover new models, summarize new experiences, propose new requirements, strengthen specific guidance through lectures, discussions, and experience-sharing meetings, and promote the mass movement of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, so that the broad masses of soldiers truly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in their minds, and push the mass movement of studying Chairman Mao's works in the entire army to a new stage.

    新华社七日讯　中国人民解放军各总部、各军种、各兵种、各军区的党委和领导机关，坚决拥护中央军委关于明年春季召开全军学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会的决定，号召所属部队广大指战员立即行动起来，迅速掀起一个活学活用毛主席著作的新高潮，以实际行动迎接大会的召开。
    连日来，总参谋部、总政治部、总后勤部和海军、空军、铁道兵、工程兵、炮兵、第二炮兵、装甲兵、通讯兵、防化兵等领导机关分别召开了党委会或直属单位的干部会，认真学习和讨论了中央军委的决定和总政治部的通知，有的还作出决定，向所属部队发出了指示和通知。北京、南京、济南、成都、兰州、沈阳、福州、武汉部队以及内蒙古、新疆、西藏军区的党委和政治机关分别进行讨论以后，要求所属部队广泛宣传中央军委决定召开这次大会的巨大意义，真正做到深入人心。广州、昆明部队党委经过讨论，还组织工作队或派出领导干部，分赴基层单位向干部、战士、职工、家属宣讲中央军委的决定，传达总政治部的通知。
    从中央军委的决定和总政治部的通知发出以来，各部队到处一片欢腾。在福建前线，“红色尖刀连”、“海上猛虎艇”的指战员们欢欣鼓舞，许多学习毛主席著作积极分子，坚定地表示，要更加努力活学活用毛主席著作，在保卫祖国、保卫无产阶级文化大革命斗争中立新功，建新劳，迎接大会的胜利召开。正在出席滇南驻军某部学习毛主席著作积极分子代表会议的全体代表和驻守云南阿佤山地区的边防战士，从广播里听到这一喜讯后，向毛主席表示决心：一定要更加倍的努力，更刻苦的学习，学出新水平，用出新水平，到北京向最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席报喜。守卫祖国南大门的塔山英雄团的指战员们和驻守在帕米尔高原的某边防部队指战员，听到这一喜讯，奔走相告，他们说：这是一件振奋人心的大喜事，是中央军委对我们最大的关怀和鼓舞。正在参加沈阳部队召开的在“三支”“两军”中活学活用毛主席著作经验交流会的刘英俊生前所在连队指导员李昌万表示：一定要象刘英俊那样，认真学习、忠实执行、热情宣传、勇敢捍卫毛泽东思想，在“三支”、“两军”工作中，坚决做到学习毛主席的革命路线，一点一滴不马虎；执行毛主席的革命路线，一分一厘不走样；宣传毛主席的革命路线，一分一秒不停息；捍卫毛主席的革命路线，一丝一毫不动摇。
    广大指战员在广泛深入地学习中央军委决定和总政治部的通知中，一致认为，在无产阶级文化大革命取得伟大胜利的时刻，林彪副主席指示并经中央军委决定召开全军学习毛主席著作积极分子代表大会，这是我军建军史上一件极为重要的大事，是全体指战员和全国人民政治生活中的一件大喜事，是进一步掀起活学活用毛主席著作新高潮的最好的号召书，最有力的动员令。他们满怀喜悦地指出，这次大会的召开，对我军活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，促进部队思想革命化的建设，都将具有巨大的推动作用；同时，对全国活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，对毛泽东思想在全世界的广泛传播，也将发生重大的影响。
    在学习中央军委的决定和总政治部的通知时，许多部队还认真地分析了本单位活学活用毛主席著作的新形势，一致认为从林彪副主席去年九月号召把毛主席著作学习提高到一个新阶段以来，部队活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动出现了一个新局面。广大干部战士对毛主席和毛泽东思想无限热爱，时时、事事、处处坚持用毛泽东思想作统帅，作灵魂，普遍注意了在大节问题上破私立公，用毛泽东思想改造世界观。在文化大革命的阶级斗争大风浪中，对毛主席著作领会得更深了，运用得更活了，特别是对毛主席关于在无产阶级专政下进行革命的理论、路线、方针和政策，有了较深刻的认识。大家认为，要通过迎接全军学习毛主席著作积极分子大会的召开，对活学活用毛主席著作进行一次大动员，对在活学活用毛主席著作群众运动中涌现出来的大量先进单位、先进人物的经验进行一次大总结、大推广，把我军活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动开展得更广泛，更深入。
    为了保证开好全军学习毛主席著作积极分子大会，指战员们一致表示，今后一定要把贯彻军委决定和总政治部通知作为重要的政治任务来抓，真正把组织领导学习毛主席著作放在先于一切，高于一切，重于一切，大于一切的位置。许多团以上的领导干部还表示，今后一定要在两条路线斗争中学好用好毛主席著作，在改造世界观上做出好样子，在贯彻和捍卫毛主席的革命路线上做出好样子。并且经常到部队检查活学活用毛主席著作的情况，通过讲用会、座谈会、经验交流会，发现新的典型，总结新的经验，提出新要求，加强具体指导，推动活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，使广大指战员在头脑里真正树立起毛泽东思想的绝对权威，把全军学习毛主席著作群众运动推向新的阶段。
