The Chinese Khrushchev, during his visit to Indonesia, completely betrayed the mandate of the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese people. During his visit, he did not propagate Mao Zedong Thought, did not approach the Indonesian working people, did not resist the malicious provocations of the Indonesian reactionary bourgeoisie, but instead shook hands and chatted with the butcher Nasution, whose hands are stained with the blood of the Indonesian people. This treacherous behavior greatly emboldened the Indonesian reactionaries and greatly dampened the spirit of the revolutionary people. What is even more infuriating is that this Chinese Khrushchev, ignoring our most red, most red sun in our hearts, allowed the Indonesian reactionary bourgeoisie to hang his and his "wife's" giant portraits everywhere. He dressed himself up as the leader of the Chinese people to boost his own status, which is utterly shameless.

During his nine-day visit to Indonesia, the Chinese Khrushchev spread the stench of the bourgeoisie everywhere. He spent the whole day fraternizing with the leading figures of the Indonesian reactionary bourgeoisie who sit on the heads of the Indonesian people, staying in luxurious and decadent dens, drinking the blood and sweat extracted from the people by the Indonesian reactionary bourgeoisie. He even shamelessly boasted about living the life of a president in Indonesia for nine days. What kind of "president" life did you live? You lived the life of a reactionary bourgeois president. For a leader of a socialist country to be eager to live the life of a bourgeois president, is this not astonishing? This fully exposes the traitorous face of the Chinese Khrushchev and reveals his true nature as a bourgeois representative who has infiltrated the party.

The reactionary film "Visit to Indonesia" is a copy of the Soviet revisionist film "Khrushchev Visits the United States." The Chinese Khrushchev and the Soviet Khrushchev performed a double act in response to each other. The Soviet Khrushchev praised the United States as the "richest and strongest country," with the "highest standard of living," and praised Eisenhower as a "great man who understands grand policies." The Chinese Khrushchev followed suit, lavishly praising the reactionary bourgeois politicians of Indonesia and beautifying bourgeois dictatorship. No wonder the Chinese Khrushchev once shouted "Long live Khrushchev!" They are birds of a feather. These two Khrushchevs also fervently advocated "peaceful coexistence," threatening and obstructing the world's revolutionary people from rising up against imperialism and capitalism, against revisionism, and against all reactionaries, attempting to restore capitalism and realize their dream of becoming bourgeois "presidents."

History's judgment is merciless. Khrushchev was ousted five years after his visit to the United States, and the Chinese Khrushchev was also exposed during this great and magnificent Cultural Revolution. These people who want to be bourgeois "presidents" will surely meet a bad end!

    要当什么“总统”？
    光华木材厂工人　沈志浩　童米绶
    中国的赫鲁晓夫在访问印尼期间，完全违背了中国共产党和中国人民的委托。在访问中，他不宣传毛泽东思想，不接近印尼劳动人民，不抵制印尼反动资产阶级的恶毒挑衅，反而同双手沾满印尼人民鲜血的大刽子手纳苏蒂安握手言欢。这种背叛行为大长了印尼反动派的气焰，大灭革命人民的威风。更加令人气愤的是：这个中国的赫鲁晓夫竟无视我们心中最红最红的红太阳，却让印尼反动资产阶级到处悬挂他和他的“夫人”的巨幅画像。他把自己打扮成为中国人民的“领袖”，用来抬高他的身价，这真是无耻之极。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫在访问印尼的九天中，到处散发资产阶级的冲天臭气。他整天同骑在印尼人民头上的印尼反动资产阶级头面人物鬼混，住的是奢华淫荡的魔窟，喝的是印尼反动资产阶级从人民身上压榨来的血汗。他还恬不知耻地夸耀自己在印尼过了九天的总统生活。你过的是什么“总统”生活？你过的是反动资产阶级总统的生活。一个堂堂的社会主义国家的领导人，却热中于过资产阶级总统的生活，岂不是咄咄怪事。这充分暴露了中国的赫鲁晓夫叛徒的嘴脸，也暴露了他是钻进党内的资产阶级代理人的本来面目。
    反动影片《访问印度尼西亚》是苏修影片《赫鲁晓夫访问美国》的翻版。中国的赫鲁晓夫和苏联的赫鲁晓夫遥相呼应，共演了一出双簧。苏联的赫鲁晓夫吹捧美国是“最富有、最强大的国家”，“有最高的生活水平”，吹捧艾森豪威尔是一个“懂得大政策的大人物”，中国的赫鲁晓夫则紧步后尘，大肆吹捧印尼反动的资产阶级政客，美化资产阶级专政。无怪乎中国的赫鲁晓夫曾经高呼“赫鲁晓夫万岁！”原来他们就是一丘之貉。这两个赫鲁晓夫还狂热地鼓吹什么“和平共处”，威胁和阻止世界革命人民起来造帝国主义和资本主义的反、造修正主义的反、造一切反动派的反，妄想复辟资本主义，以实现他们做资产阶级的“总统”的梦想。
    历史的审判是无情的。赫鲁晓夫在访问美国的五年以后，滚下台了，而中国的赫鲁晓夫也在这场轰轰烈烈的文化大革命中被揪出来了。这些一心要做资产阶级“总统”的家伙，决没有好下场！
