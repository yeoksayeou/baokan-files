British Hong Kong forces invaded Kowloon Walled City on July 24, illegally arresting one of our residents. The residents of the walled city have lodged a serious protest against the British imperialists' infringement of our sovereignty.

According to Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong on July 28, the British Hong Kong authorities dispatched a large number of armed police on July 24 to brutally invade Kowloon Walled City, which has always been under Chinese jurisdiction. They conducted extensive searches and illegally arrested a resident of the walled city. The Kowloon Walled City Residents' Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee has lodged a serious protest.

Kowloon Walled City is located in the northeastern part of Kowloon. In January 1963, responsible officials of the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had repeatedly solemnly declared that Kowloon Walled City is part of Hong Kong's Kowloon, which has always been under Chinese jurisdiction. Now, while madly persecuting patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong, the British Hong Kong authorities have even invaded Kowloon Walled City and wantonly persecuted its residents, seriously infringing upon China's sovereignty and the rights of the walled city's residents.

At around 5 PM on July 24, more than 200 British Hong Kong "riot police" suddenly arrived at Kowloon Walled City and immediately forced their way in, setting up blockades everywhere and sealing off streets. British Hong Kong helicopters also began circling above the walled city. After setting up their positions, British police officers led a large number of "riot police" to attack the Kowloon Walled City Neighborhood Welfare Association on Old Man Street. The British fascist thugs used iron bars to pry open iron gates, break through walls, and enter the association, wreaking havoc and looting. They tore down the flag of the People's Republic of China hanging inside and ruthlessly threw Chairman Mao's portrait on the ground. Subsequently, the British Hong Kong police also entered the Kowloon Walled City Neighborhood Recreation Center, causing chaos and destruction.

At the same time, British Hong Kong "riot police" and special agents attacked the New China School on Dongtou Road inside the walled city, forcibly abducting the school's principal.

The British Hong Kong police's search and arrest operation in the walled city lasted for about an hour and a half, until around 6 PM when they withdrew. As they left, they loaded the items they had looted from the Kowloon Walled City Neighborhood Association and Recreation Center onto trucks and drove away.

The Kowloon Walled City Residents' Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee and the New China School Parents and Alumni Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee issued a joint statement on the evening of July 24, lodging a serious protest against the British Hong Kong authorities' fascist atrocities of brutally infringing upon China's sovereignty and the rights of the walled city's residents. The statement solemnly demands that the British Hong Kong authorities: immediately release the illegally arrested principal of New China School; compensate for all damages; apologize to our walled city residents and confess their crimes; and guarantee that similar incidents will not occur again.

    港英侵入我九龙城寨，无理逮捕我居民
    城寨居民严重抗议英帝侵犯我主权
    据新华社香港二十八日电　港英当局七月二十四日派出大批武装警察，野蛮侵入一向由中国行使管辖权的九龙城寨，大肆进行搜查，并无理逮捕了一名城寨居民。九龙城寨居民反对港英迫害斗争委员会提出严重抗议。
    九龙城寨位于九龙东北部。一九六三年一月间，我国外交部负责人员为香港英国当局企图强迫拆迁九龙城寨事曾多次郑重声明，九龙城寨是我国领土香港九龙的一部分，它一向由中国行使管辖权。而现在，港英当局在疯狂迫害香港爱国同胞的同时，竟然闯入九龙城寨，肆意迫害城寨居民，严重地侵犯了中国的主权和城寨居民的权益。
    二十四日下午五时，二百多名港英
  “防暴队”突然开到九龙城寨附近，并且马上强行进入城寨，到处布防，封锁街道。港英的直升飞机也开始在城寨上空盘旋。布防完毕，英籍警官便率领一大批
  “防暴队”员袭击老人街的九龙城寨街坊福利会。港英法西斯暴徒用铁棒撬毁铁闸，破墙进入会所，大肆捣毁和搜劫，并将会所内悬挂的中华人民共和国国旗扯下来，蛮横无理地将画报上的毛主席像抛在地上。随后港英警察又进入九龙城寨街坊康乐馆，恣意捣乱和破坏。
    与此同时，港英的“防暴队”和特务又袭击城寨内东头村道的新华学校，强行绑架了这所学校的校长。
    港英警察对城寨的搜捕大约进行了一个多小时，直到下午六时许才撤离城寨。他们临走时，还把在九龙城街坊会和康乐馆抢劫的物品，用汽车运走。
    九龙城寨居民反对港英迫害斗争委员会和新华学校家长校友反对港英迫害斗争委员会二十四日晚发表联合声明，严重抗议港英当局野蛮侵犯中国主权和城寨居民权益的法西斯暴行。声明严正要求港英当局：立即释放无理逮捕的新华学校校长；赔偿一切损失；向我城寨居民道歉认罪；保证不再发生类似事件。
