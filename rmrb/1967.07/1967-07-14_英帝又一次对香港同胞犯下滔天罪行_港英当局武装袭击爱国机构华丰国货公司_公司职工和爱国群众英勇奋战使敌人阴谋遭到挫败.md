The British fascist authorities in Hong Kong, from the night of the 11th to the morning of the 12th, organized, planned, and premeditated a armed attack on the Hong Kong patriotic institution, Hua Feng National Goods Company, committing another heinous crime against Hong Kong compatriots. The employees of this company and nearby patriotic masses, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, fought bravely, engaging the enemy for thirteen hours, preventing the enemy from entering the company premises.

Around 6 PM on the 11th, several hundred "riot control" personnel equipped with carbines, tear gas, slingshots, and shotguns, under the command of British officers, arrived at the Hua Feng National Goods Company in the North Point district of Hong Kong. They took up positions on the streets in front of the company and on the rooftop of the building opposite, firing tear gas and slingshots to disperse the crowd. Subsequently, the British authorities in Hong Kong announced a curfew (martial law) in the city from 10:30 PM, intending to use the curfew to isolate the crowd and launch a savage armed attack on the Hua Feng National Goods Company.

Around 8 PM, the "riot control" personnel began a pincer movement against the Hua Feng National Goods Company, intermittently firing slingshots and tear gas into the company. The brave employees of the Hua Feng National Goods Company insisted on keeping the doors open for business. At 9:30 PM, when the business hours ended and the employees were about to close the doors, a large number of "riot control" personnel pointed their guns at the employees and announced over a loudspeaker that the doors must not be closed, or they would open fire. At that time, the company's responsible person protested strongly over the loudspeaker and warned the British police that if they opened fire, all serious consequences would be the responsibility of the British authorities.

The "riot control" personnel, disregarding the company's protest, fired slingshots, injuring two employees who were closing the doors. The employees attempted to close the doors several times but were met with savage gunfire from the "riot control" personnel. Finally, five employees, facing the slingshots and tear gas fired from the opposite side, bravely rushed forward to close the doors. Subsequently, the "riot control" personnel fired slingshots and tear gas more densely into the Hua Feng National Goods Company. Most of the glass windows and display windows on the ground floor and the second floor of the company were shattered, and a fire broke out in the downstairs commercial area. Nearby residents were outraged that the British "riot control" personnel were wantonly attacking a patriotic institution in a densely populated area, causing a fire. They loudly condemned the inhumanity of the "riot control" personnel. The fascist thugs then raised their carbines and slingshots and fired at the protesting crowd. The fascist thugs then broke down the closed iron door of the Hua Feng National Goods Company, rushed into the downstairs commercial area, tore down the anti-British resistance big-character posters and Chairman Mao's quotations on the walls, removed the banners reading "Patriotism is not a crime, resistance is justified," and stole the news photos exposing the British atrocities.

In the face of the enemy's frenzied attack, the company's employees displayed great courage and fought bravely. When the fire broke out in the downstairs commercial area, the employees, regardless of the flying tear gas and slingshots and the poisonous gas, rushed to extinguish the fire. A female employee, choked by the tear gas, could hardly stand, but when she saw the cotton department on fire, she immediately picked up a wet sack and bravely rushed to extinguish the fire.

The employees, in the struggle, always remembered Chairman Mao's teachings and armed themselves with Mao Zedong Thought. When the fire blocked the staircase, the enemy's slingshots and tear gas continued to fly in, and many had been choked unconscious, the employees still loudly recited Chairman Mao's quotations: "Resolutely determined, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory." They encouraged each other. After more than two hours of rescue efforts, they finally extinguished the fire.

Under the armed attack of the "riot control" personnel, at least ten employees were injured, and most of the downstairs commercial area and part of the second floor commercial area of the Hua Feng National Goods Company were burned down.

When the "riot control" personnel launched their armed attack on the Hua Feng National Goods Company, the residents of the Xia Guan Building where the company is located, as well as nearby workers, students, and compatriots, rushed to support them.

The brave employees of the Hua Feng National Goods Company, with the strong support of patriotic compatriots, engaged the enemy for a full thirteen hours. It was not until around 7 AM on the 12th that the "riot control" personnel withdrew. Many people gathered around the scene, and they all hated and were indignant about the British authorities' atrocities.

The Hua Feng National Goods Company incident shows that the British authorities in Hong Kong have escalated their persecution of patriotic compatriots to a dangerous level. Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out: "We warn those who play with fire not to be too reckless. This fire is not something to be trifled with. Be careful with your own heads."

    英帝又一次对香港同胞犯下滔天罪行
    港英当局武装袭击爱国机构华丰国货公司
    公司职工和爱国群众英勇奋战使敌人阴谋遭到挫败
    据新华社香港十三日电　港英法西斯当局从十一日夜到十二日早晨，有组织有计划有预谋地武装袭击了香港爱国机构华丰国货公司，又一次对香港同胞犯下滔天罪行。这家公司的职工和附近爱国群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，英勇奋战，同敌人周旋了十三个小时，使敌人始终不能进入公司内部。
    十一日下午六时左右，几百名配备有卡宾枪、催泪弹、木弹枪和铁砂枪的“防暴队”，在英国警官指挥下，开到香港北角区华丰国货公司附近，在公司前面街道和公司对面大厦的天台上布防，发射催泪弹和木弹驱散群众。随后，港英当局宣布，从晚上十时半开始在香港市区实施宵禁（戒严），蓄意利用宵禁来隔离群众，以便猖獗地向华丰国货公司发动武装袭击。
    将近八时，“防暴队”对华丰国货公司展开钳形包围，不时向公司内施放木弹和催泪弹。英勇的华丰国货公司职工坚持开门营业。到九时三十分营业时间结束，当公司职工准备关闭大门的时候，大批
  “防暴队”用枪指着职工，并用扬声器宣布不准关门，否则就要开枪射击。当时，公司负责人用扬声器向港英当局提出严重抗议，并严正警告港英警察，如果开枪射击，由此引起的一切严重后果必须由港英当局负责。
    “防暴队”不顾公司的抗议，悍然发射木弹打伤了两名正在关门的职工。公司职工接着几次要关门，都遭到“防暴队”的野蛮射击。最后，五名职工迎着对面射来的木弹、催泪弹，勇敢地冲上去把大门关闭。随后，“防暴队”更加密集地把木弹和催泪弹射入华丰国货公司，公司地下和二楼商场的大部分玻璃窗和橱窗玻璃被击破，并引起楼下商场发生大火。附近居民对港英“防暴队”竟在人口稠密的地区肆意袭击爱国机构并因而引起大火，莫不怒火满腔，纷纷大声斥责。灭绝人性的“防暴队”，竟举起卡宾枪、木弹枪向抗议的群众射击。法西斯暴徒接着又把华丰国货公司已关闭的大铁门撬烂，闯进楼下商场，撕毁反英抗暴大字报和墙上贴的毛主席语录，扯下写着“爱国无罪，抗暴有理”的横幅标语，抢走揭露港英暴行的新闻图片。
    在敌人的疯狂进攻面前，公司职工发扬了大无畏精神，进行了勇敢的战斗。当地下商场发生大火的时候，广大职工奋不顾身，不管催泪弹和木弹横飞，毒瓦斯弥漫，纷纷前去抢救。一位女职工被催泪毒瓦斯熏得难以支持，但当她看见棉织部着火燃烧的时候，立刻拿起湿麻袋奋勇地扑上去。
    职工们在斗争中始终牢记毛主席的教导，用毛泽东思想武装头脑。当大火封住梯口的时候，敌人的木弹和催泪弹仍然不断射进来，不少人已被熏倒，处境十分困难，职工们仍然高声朗读毛主席语录：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”他们互相鼓舞斗志。经过两个多小时的抢救，终于把大火扑灭。
    在“防暴队”的武力袭击下，已知至少有十名职工受伤，华丰国货公司楼下商场的大部分和二楼商场一部分已被焚毁。
    “防暴队”武力袭击华丰国货公司的时候，华丰国货公司所在的侨冠大厦的住客和附近的工人、学生和同胞纷纷前来支援。
    英勇的华丰国货公司职工在爱国同胞的大力支援下，同敌人周旋了整整十三个小时。直到十二日早上七时左右，“防暴队”才撤走。许多群众围着现场观看，他们对港英当局的暴行无不切齿痛恨，愤慨万分。
    华丰国货公司事件表明，港英当局已把对爱国同胞的迫害升上危险的一级。我们伟大的领袖毛主席早已指出：“希望那班玩火的人，不要过于冲昏头脑。我们正式警告他们说：放谨慎一点吧，这种火是不好玩的，仔细你们自己的脑袋。”
