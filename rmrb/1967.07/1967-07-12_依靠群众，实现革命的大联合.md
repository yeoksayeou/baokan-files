The Tianjin Silk Weaving Factory No. 3, under the control of a small clique of capitalists within the Hebei Provincial Committee and the Tianjin Municipal Committee, had long implemented a counter-revolutionary revisionist line. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the leaders within the factory who adhered to the bourgeois reactionary line, in order to shift the target and protect themselves, labeled revolutionary masses as "counter-revolutionaries," inciting masses to fight against masses, causing severe opposition among mass organizations.

Inspired by the January Revolution in Shanghai, the revolutionary organization of the factory, the Rebel Corps, seized power on January 29. However, because the bourgeois reactionary line had not been thoroughly criticized and settled, after the Rebel Corps seized power, the other eight mass organizations in the factory only had one supporting them. Various mass organizations were engrossed in "internal wars," hindering the revolution and production, and affecting the realization of the great revolutionary unity.

It is necessary to achieve a broad revolutionary unity with the leftists as the core. But who are the leftists? After the Mao Zedong Thought Propaganda Team entered the factory on March 12, the core members of various mass organizations and the majority of workers flocked to report the situation, urgently requesting us to express our stance, pointing out which organization is leftist and which is conservative.

Distinguishing who the revolutionary leftists are is a problem that must be solved first in supporting the left. Some people thought that since Chairman Mao sent the army to support the broad leftist masses, the army is the "natural referee." The masses have this understanding out of their sincere trust in the army. We are the servants of the people, the students of the masses. If we regard ourselves as the "superiors of the masses" and the "natural referees," that is extremely wrong.

How to correctly handle the relationship with the masses is a matter of stance and worldview. Chairman Mao teaches us: "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and ignorant." Only by firmly believing in the masses and relying on them can we correctly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. The working class is the main force of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The deeds of various mass organizations are clear in their hearts. They grasp Mao Zedong Thought and can clearly distinguish between the various organizations. Therefore, upon entering the factory, we did not rush to express our stance but, through various forms, studied Chairman Mao's works together with the broad masses, studied the party's policies during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, mobilized the masses to discuss the direction of the movement and the two lines.

The process of study and discussion is also a process of investigation and research. In our investigation, we did not limit ourselves to some isolated facts and superficial phenomena but started from political ideology, investigating the organizational situation, struggle history, and attitudes in major events of various organizations. Grasping political ideology is to firmly grasp the class struggle and line struggle, distinguishing who truly stands on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line; it is to directly grasp the essence of the problem, avoiding entanglement in trivial issues, distinguishing who grasps the direction of the struggle; it is to communicate with the masses, conduct targeted political and ideological education, pay attention to listening to various different opinions, investigate, discuss, study, and improve simultaneously.

The process of study and discussion is also a process of mobilizing various mass organizations and cadres to rectify their styles. In the discussion, some organizations thought their direction was correct, and minor flaws were nothing; some organizations thought they were very disciplined and had no issue with the direction; some cadres did not understand the mass movement and had grievances. With deep class feelings, we targeted these active thoughts, helped them actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, guided them to open the door for rectification, correctly recognize themselves and others.

Through study and discussion, through open rectification, the broad masses raised their awareness. Revolutionary organizations affirmed their direction while criticizing their flaws and mistakes; those with conservative thoughts, the more they studied, the more they felt their direction was wrong; some cadres also realized the wrongness of passive conservatism and should stand out with the masses to make a revolution. More and more people gradually saw that the Rebel Corps was a revolutionary leftist organization.

On April 17, the factory held a meeting to denounce the bourgeois reactionary line. The Rebel Corps criticized the bourgeois reactionary line, reported their rectification situation, and checked their flaws and mistakes in work. The leaders of organizations with conservative tendencies also denounced the harm of the bourgeois reactionary line, admitted they had taken the wrong side in the Cultural Revolution, and expressed their determination to return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, firmly supporting all revolutionary actions of the Rebel Corps. Some cadres also denounced the harm of "Cultivation" and expressed their determination to be with the revolutionary masses, following Chairman Mao to make a revolution. At this meeting, we publicly expressed to all revolutionary workers in the factory that we firmly support the Rebel Corps.

Chairman Mao teaches us: The proletariat not only needs to liberate itself but also needs to liberate all of humanity. If the proletariat cannot liberate all of humanity, it cannot ultimately liberate itself. According to Chairman Mao's teachings, we helped the Rebel Corps further rectify their views on the mass organizations that had made conservative mistakes and the deceived masses, actively and proactively do political and ideological work, and achieve great revolutionary unity.

Some members of the Rebel Corps, due to the persecution of the bourgeois reactionary line and the change in status, developed a sense of pride and had some incorrect views on the great revolutionary unity. They thought that those with conservative ideas "cannot change," "admitting mistakes is fake," and "cannot sit on the same bench." Targeting these active thoughts, we studied with the comrades of the Rebel Corps Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," the "Three Articles," and "On Rectifying Erroneous Ideas in the Party" and other brilliant works. We helped them use Chairman Mao's works as weapons to break private thoughts and establish public thoughts, overcome private thoughts and杂念 in their minds. They checked their wrong thoughts of windiness, small-groupism, individualism, and self-satisfaction, realizing that the main contradiction is between the broad masses and the small clique of capitalists within the party, and the masses who joined the conservative organizations are also victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. The contradiction between the revolutionary faction and the deceived masses is a contradiction among the people. We should enthusiastically help them, unite with them, and not discriminate against or exclude them. For every small progress of the deceived masses, we should enthusiastically welcome it. For a few people who temporarily cannot change their thoughts, we should patiently wait and promote their transformation.

Thus, many members of the Rebel Corps actively sought out their class brothers for heart-to-heart talks, checked their flaws and mistakes, humbly sought the opinions of others, and welcomed them to make a revolution together. These actions moved many deceived masses. They revealed their true feelings, saying: "We originally thought that after the army expressed its stance, you would become arrogant and look down on us, but unexpectedly, you became more humble than before."

At the same time, the Rebel Corps, together with the broad masses, launched a great criticism and denunciation movement against the biggest capitalist-roaders within the party, refuted the fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious," and smashed the spiritual shackles of "tame tools." On the basis of common enemy, they further eliminated ideological opposition and estrangement, deepened class feelings.

"Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the party." To better win over and unite the majority of masses and cadres, following Chairman Mao's teachings, we analyzed the mass organizations with conservative tendencies with the Rebel Corps. We believe that conservative organizations must be concretely analyzed and treated differently. Without distinction, there is no policy. The "one-size-fits-all" approach is wrong. Here, not only should the masses who joined the conservative organizations be distinguished from those who manipulated these organizations behind the scenes, but also different conservative mass organizations should be treated differently. After research, the Rebel Corps divided the seven mass organizations with conservative tendencies into three types and adopted different approaches. Among them, two organizations, after positive education, their leaders and masses realized that their organizations had made directional mistakes and announced their withdrawal, and these two organizations dissolved themselves. Another two organizations, mainly composed of mid-level cadres, after realizing their mistakes, felt they should go to the masses to eliminate the opposition between cadres and masses, and they also disbanded themselves. The remaining three organizations were split from the original conservative organizations. They were dissatisfied with the original conservative organizations and also disagreed with some actions of the Rebel Corps. The Rebel Corps studied Chairman Mao's works with them, helped them correct their direction, rectify their mistakes, and united on the premise of a consistent direction.

Because we and the Rebel Corps firmly implemented the policy of distinguishing and treating differently the organizations with conservative tendencies, the factory established a joint revolutionary command department with the Rebel Corps as the core and five revolutionary mass organizations participating, achieving the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary factions in the entire factory.

Now, the situation in the Silk Weaving Factory No. 3 is excellent. The movement is developing in depth. The broad revolutionary masses, with one heart and one mind, combine the great criticism of the biggest clique of capitalist-roaders within the party with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their units. The poison of the bourgeois reactionary line is being eliminated, and a revolutionary, representative, and authoritative proletarian "three-in-one" power organ is about to be established. The broad revolutionary workers actively respond to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution, promote production," and the production enthusiasm of the workers is unprecedentedly high; labor discipline is further strengthened; the organizational structure has been adjusted, further consolidating the proletarian authority of the new production leadership team; cadres have participated in labor, and work enthusiasm has improved. Production efficiency has significantly improved compared to the previous period, and production is steadily rising.

Through this period of work, we deeply feel that to do a good job in supporting the left, we must highlight Mao Zedong Thought, adhere to the mass line, and adhere to self-revolution. Only by highlighting Mao Zedong Thought, using Mao Zedong Thought to arm our minds, mobilizing the broad masses to identify and support the left with us, can we correctly recognize and firmly implement Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Doing so, although the process of identifying the left seems longer, the work of supporting the left is actually carried out faster and more solidly. Doing so is more beneficial to winning over and uniting the majority of masses and cadres, achieving great revolutionary unity faster, and promoting the "three-in-one" combination of the revolution.

Our work in supporting the left has achieved some results, but our understanding is still shallow, and our feelings are not deep. In the future, we will better study and apply Chairman Mao's works, take class struggle as the classroom, learn from the working class, and in changing the objective world, change the subjective world, and do a better job in supporting the left.

    依靠群众，实现革命的大联合
    中国人民解放军北京部队空军某部毛泽东思想宣传队
    天津市色织三厂，在河北省委、天津市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的控制下，长期以来贯彻了一条反革命修正主义路线。无产阶级文化大革命中，厂内那些坚持资产阶级反动路线的领导人，为了转移目标，保护自己，把革命群众打成“反革命”，挑动群众斗群众，造成群众组织之间的严重对立。
    在上海“一月革命”风暴的鼓舞下，厂内的革命组织造反大队在一月二十九日夺了权。但是，由于资产阶级反动路线没有得到彻底批判和清算，造反大队夺权后，厂内其他八个群众组织，只有一个支持他们。各群众组织热中于打“内战”，妨碍了抓革命、促生产，影响了革命大联合的实现。
    必须实现以左派为核心的广泛的革命大联合。但是，谁是左派呢？我们毛泽东思想宣传队三月十二日进厂后，各群众组织的核心成员和广大职工，纷纷上门反映情况，迫切要求我们表态，指出哪个组织是左派，哪个组织是保守派。
    鉴别谁是革命左派，是支左工作必须首先解决的问题。有人以为，毛主席派解放军支持左派广大群众，解放军是“当然的裁判员”。群众这种认识，是出于对解放军的真挚信赖。我们是人民的勤务员，群众的小学生。如果把自己看作“群众的上司”，“当然的裁判员”，那是极端错误的。
    如何正确对待群众的问题，是一个立场问题，世界观问题。毛主席教导我们：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”。只有坚定地相信群众，依靠群众，才能正确执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。工人群众是无产阶级文化大革命的主力军。各个群众组织的所作所为，他们心里都有一本帐。他们掌握了毛泽东思想，就能清楚地鉴别各个组织。所以，我们一进厂没有急于表态，而是通过各种形式，同广大群众一起学习毛主席著作，学习党在无产阶级文化大革命中的方针政策，放手发动群众，展开关于运动的大方向和两条路线的讨论。
    学习讨论的过程，也是调查研究的过程。我们在调查中，没有局限于一些孤立的事实，表面的现象，而是从政治思想入手，对各个组织的组织状况、斗争历史、在重大事件中的态度等作了调查研究。抓住政治思想，就是要紧紧抓住阶级斗争、路线斗争这个纲，分清谁真正站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边；就是要直接抓住问题的本质，避开枝节问题的纠缠，分清谁掌握了斗争的大方向；就是同群众沟通思想，有针对性地进行政治思想教育，注意听取各种不同意见，边调查，边讨论，边学习，边提高。
    学习讨论的过程，又是发动各群众组织和干部整风的过程。在讨论中，有的组织认为自己大方向正确，有缺点算不得什么；有的组织认为自己很守规矩，没有大方向对不对的问题；有的干部对群众运动不理解，有怨气。我们怀着深厚的阶级感情，针对这些活思想，帮助他们活学活用毛主席著作，引导他们开门整风，正确认识自己，认识别人。
    通过学习讨论，通过开门整风，广大职工提高了认识。革命组织既肯定了自己的大方向，又对缺点错误展开了自我批评；有保守思想的人，越学习，越觉得自己的大方向不对头；有的干部也认识到消极保守的不对，应当站出来同群众一起革命。越来越多的人逐步认清了，造反大队是革命左派组织。
    四月十七日，厂里召开了一个控诉资产阶级反动路线大会。造反大队批判了资产阶级反动路线，同时汇报了他们的整风情况，检查了工作中的缺点和错误。有保守倾向的组织的负责人，也控诉了资产阶级反动路线的毒害，承认自己在文化大革命中站错了队，表示一定要回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决支持造反大队的一切革命行动。有些干部也控诉了《修养》对自己的毒害，表示要同革命群众在一起，紧跟毛主席闹革命。在这个大会上，我们公开向全厂革命职工表示，坚决支持造反大队。
    毛主席教导我们：无产阶级不但要解放自己，而且要解放全人类。如果不能解放全人类，无产阶级自己就不能最后地得到解放。按照毛主席的教导，我们帮助造反大队，进一步端正对犯过保守错误的群众组织和受蒙蔽群众的看法，积极主动地去做政治思想工作，实现革命的大联合。
    造反大队的一些成员，由于资产阶级反动路线的迫害，由于地位发生变化而产生了骄傲情绪，对革命大联合存在一些不正确的看法。他们认为那些有保守思想的人“变不了”，“承认错误是假的”，“同他们坐不到一条板凳上”。针对这些活思想，我们同造反大队的同志一起，认真学习毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、“老三篇”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作。帮助他们以毛主席著作为武器，破私立公，克服头脑中的私心杂念。他们检查了风头主义、小团体主义、个人主义和骄傲自满等错误思想，认识到广大群众同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾是主要矛盾，而参加保守组织的群众，也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。革命派同受蒙蔽群众的矛盾，属于人民内部矛盾。应当满腔热情地帮助他们，团结他们，而不应当歧视他们，排斥他们。对于受蒙蔽的群众每一点微小的进步，要热情欢迎，少数人一时思想拐不过弯来，也要耐心等待，促进他们转变。
    于是，造反大队的许多成员，主动地找自己的阶级兄弟促膝谈心，检查自己的缺点和错误，虚心征求对方的意见，欢迎对方一起闹革命。这些行动，感动了许多受蒙蔽的群众。他们掏出了自己的心里话，说：“我们本来以为解放军表态后你们会翘尾巴，看不起我们，没想到你们变得比以前更谦虚了。”
    同时，造反大队又同广大职工一起，开展对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大控诉运动，驳斥“剥削有功”的谬论，粉碎“驯服工具”的精神枷锁。在共同对敌的基础上，进一步消除了思想上的对立和隔阂，增进了彼此间的阶级感情。
    “政策和策略是党的生命”。为了更好地争取团结大多数群众和干部，遵循毛主席的教导，我们同造反大队一道，对有保守倾向的群众组织作了具体分析。我们认为，对保守组织必须具体分析，区别对待。没有区别就没有政策。“一刀切”的做法，是错误的。在这里，不仅要把参加保守组织的群众同幕后操纵这些组织的人区别开来，而且要对各个有保守倾向的群众组织区别对待。经过研究，造反大队对七个有保守倾向的群众组织，分为三个类型，采取不同的做法。其中有两个组织，经过正面教育，他们的负责人和群众都认识到自己的组织犯了方向性错误，纷纷宣布退出，这两个组织就自行解体了。另外两个以中层干部为主的组织，当他们认识错误后，感到应当到群众中去，消除干部和群众之间的对立，他们也自动解散了。还有三个组织，是从原来的保守组织中分化出来的。他们既不满意原保守组织，也不同意造反大队的某些做法。造反大队同他们一块活学活用毛主席著作，帮助他们端正方向，改正错误，在大方向一致的前提下联合起来。
    由于我们同造反大队对有保守倾向的组织坚决执行了区别对待的政策，工厂建立了以造反大队为核心的，有五个革命群众组织参加的联合革命指挥部，实现了全厂无产阶级革命派的大联合。
    现在，色织三厂形势一片大好。运动正在向纵深发展。广大革命群众，齐心协力，把对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判同本单位的斗批改结合起来，资产阶级反动路线的流毒正在肃清，一个革命的、有代表性的、有无产阶级权威的“三结合”的权力机构，即将建立。广大革命职工积极响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，工人群众的生产积极性空前高涨，劳动纪律进一步增强；组织机构进行了调整，进一步巩固了新的生产领导班子的无产阶级权威；干部参加了劳动，工作积极性有了提高。生产效率比前一个时期显著提高，生产正在稳步上升。
    通过这一段工作，我们深深体会到，要做好支左工作，必须突出毛泽东思想，坚持群众路线，坚持自我革命。只有突出毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想武装我们的头脑，发动广大群众，同我们一起去识别和支持左派，才能够正确认识和坚决贯彻毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。这样做，表面看来，识别左派的过程好象长了，而实际上支持左派的工作却开展得更快了，做得更扎实了。这样做，更有利于争取团结大多数群众和干部，更快地实现革命的大联合，促进革命的“三结合”。
    我们的支左工作取得了一定的成绩，但是，认识还很肤浅，体会还不深刻。今后，我们要更好地活学活用毛主席著作，以阶级斗争为课堂，拜工人群众为老师，在改造客观世界的同时改造主观世界，把支左工作做得更好。
