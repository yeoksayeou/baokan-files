	The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with.

	We strongly protest the U.S. aircraft attack on a Chinese merchant ship.

	The Foreign Ministry spokesman pointed out that the U.S. aircraft's pirate attack on a Chinese merchant ship docked at the port of Haiphong is a very serious step in the conspiracy to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam. It is closely related to the recent talks between Johnson and Kosygin. China is closely watching this new U.S. imperialist "escalation" of the war.

	New China News Agency, July 6th: The Foreign Ministry spokesman of the People's Republic of China issued a statement on July 6th, strongly protesting the crime of U.S. imperialism dispatching pirate aircraft to attack a Chinese merchant ship docked at the port of Haiphong. The statement of the Foreign Ministry spokesman is as follows:

	On June 29th, U.S. pirate aircraft, while once again bombing and strafing the second-largest city in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, Haiphong, swooped down to bomb the Chinese merchant ship "Hongqi-157" docked at the port of Haiphong, causing serious damage to the Chinese merchant ship. U.S. imperialism brazenly attacked a Chinese merchant ship flying the flag of the People's Republic of China. This is another serious provocation against the Chinese people after U.S. imperialism recently used pirate aircraft to attack Chinese fishing boats one after another. The Chinese government and people strongly protest this pirate behavior of U.S. imperialism.

	In recent times, U.S. imperialism has been sending large numbers of troops to South Vietnam and dispatching U.S. invading troops to invade the demilitarized zone. In North Vietnam, U.S. pirate aircraft have been continuously bombing and strafing cities such as Hanoi, Haiphong, and Nam Dinh, and continuously expanding the bombing range. Now, U.S. aircraft have even attacked a Chinese merchant ship docked at the port of Haiphong. This is a very serious step in the Johnson administration's conspiracy to expand the war of aggression against Vietnam and is closely related to the recent talks between Johnson and Kosygin. The Chinese government and people are closely watching this new U.S. imperialist "escalation" of the war.

	Chairman Mao said: "'Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet' is a Chinese proverb used to describe the behavior of some stupid people. The reactionaries of all countries are precisely such a bunch of stupid people." While expanding the war of aggression against Vietnam, the crazy provocations of U.S. imperialism against the Chinese people can only strengthen the Chinese people's resolve to support Vietnam and resist the U.S. The Chinese people resolutely support the Vietnamese people in fighting the war of resistance against the U.S. to the end and achieving final victory. If the U.S. pirates dare to expand the war and insist on confronting the Chinese people, then the Chinese people have long been prepared and will give the U.S. aggressors a double blow. We solemnly warn the U.S. pirates: The seven hundred million Chinese people armed with Mao Zedong Thought are not to be trifled with. U.S. imperialism must immediately stop this barbaric pirate behavior; otherwise, it must bear full responsibility for all the serious consequences that may arise from this.

### 我最强烈抗议美机袭击中国商船

　　毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是不好惹的
　　我最强烈抗议美机袭击中国商船
    外交部发言人声明指出，美机对停泊在海防港口的中国商船进行强盗袭击，是阴谋扩大侵越战争的极其严重的步骤，是同约翰逊和柯西金最近的会谈密切相关的。中国正密切注视美帝的这一新的战争“升级”行动。
    新华社六日讯　中华人民共和国外交部发言人六日发表声明，最强烈抗议美帝国主义出动强盗飞机对停泊在海防港口的中国商船进行袭击的罪行。外交部发言人的声明如下：
    六月二十九日，美国强盗飞机在再次轰炸和扫射越南民主共和国第二大城市海防的时候，竟然向停泊在海防港口的我国商船“红旗——一五七号”俯冲轰炸，使我国商船受到严重损伤。美帝国主义明目张胆地对悬挂有中华人民共和国国旗的我国商船进行袭击，这是它最近接二连三用强盗飞机袭击中国渔船后，对中国人民进行的又一次严重挑衅。中国政府和中国人民对美帝国主义的这种强盗行为，提出最强烈的抗议。
    最近以来，美帝国主义向南越大举增兵，并派遣美国侵略军入侵非军事区；在越南北方，美国强盗飞机连续对河内、海防、南定等城市进行狂轰滥炸，不断扩大轰炸范围。现在，美国飞机竟然对停泊在海防港口的中国商船进行强盗袭击。这是约翰逊政府阴谋扩大侵越战争的一个极其严重的步骤，是同约翰逊和柯西金最近的会谈密切相关的。中国政府和中国人民正密切注视美帝国主义的这一新的战争“升级”行动。
    毛主席说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”美帝国主义在扩大侵略越南战争的同时，向中国人民进行的疯狂挑衅，只能更加强化中国人民援越抗美的决心。中国人民坚决支援越南人民将抗美救国战争进行到底，直到取得最后胜利。如果美国强盗胆敢扩大战火，硬要同中国人民较量，那么，中国人民早已作好准备，将给予美国侵略者以加倍的还击。我们要严正警告美国强盗：用毛泽东思想武装起来的七亿中国人民是不好惹的，美帝国主义必须立即停止这种野蛮的强盗行为，否则，它必须对由此而引起的一切严重后果承担全部责任。
