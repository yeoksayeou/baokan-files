The *Red Flag* magazine published in its 10th issue of 1967 the "Several Regulations on Seriously Transforming Work Style by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee" and an editorial titled "Preventing the Infiltration of Bourgeois Ideology." This is a great concern, inspiration, and urging from Chairman Mao and the Party Central Committee to the proletarian revolutionary factions and the broad masses of revolutionaries in our province.

After the publication of the editorial and the regulations by the *Red Flag* magazine, the Shanghai Municipal Revolutionary Committee immediately held an expanded meeting to enthusiastically discuss and study the regulations, and passed the decision "Resolutely Learning and Implementing the 'Several Regulations on Seriously Transforming Work Style by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee'." The *Wenhui Daily* and the *Liberation Daily* also published editorials. This is also the support and urging from the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary factions to us. The revolutionary spirit of the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary comrades, who act swiftly and decisively, sets an example for us to learn from. We must seriously learn from the Shanghai comrades, strictly and unconditionally execute the regulations, and forever be loyal to Chairman Mao, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and loyal to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. We will do as Chairman Mao says.

After the proletarian revolutionary factions take power, their positions have changed. Under these circumstances, a very sharp question is placed before us: Will we continue to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, "continue to maintain the style of being humble, prudent, modest, and unhurried," "continue to maintain the style of hard struggle," and carry the revolution through to the end? Or will we be corrupted by bourgeois ideology and style, lie on the "armchair of victory," comfortably "peacefully evolve," and let the proletarian dictatorship be usurped by the bourgeoisie again?

We must understand that victory is a new severe test for the proletarian revolutionary factions. If we relax our ideological transformation and comfortably "peacefully evolve" while sitting on the "armchair of victory," we will slide onto the path of revisionism and repeat the mistakes of the handful of power-holders who took the capitalist road within the Party.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The development of society has reached today's era, and the responsibility of correctly recognizing and transforming the world has historically fallen on the shoulders of the proletariat and its party." "The proletariat and revolutionary people's struggle to transform the world includes accomplishing the following tasks: transforming the objective world and also transforming one's subjective world—transforming one's ability to recognize, transforming the relationship between the subjective world and the objective world." The proletarian revolutionary factions must shoulder the historical burden, firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, be highly vigilant against the attacks of bourgeois sugar-coated bullets, and consciously and continuously use Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to transform our thoughts, prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, and forever preserve our proletarian character. After winning the power struggle, we must continue to maintain the styles of being humble, prudent, modest, and unhurried, and of hard struggle, "be the 'ox' of the proletariat and the masses, work tirelessly, and die for the cause." For us proletarian revolutionary factions, "official" does not mean privileges, enjoyment, or being the "superior of the people." Instead, it should mean being the "ox" of the proletariat and the masses, being a diligent servant of the people. Only a leadership cadre formed by such people is a true proletarian leadership cadre, which can achieve the revolutionization of the leadership organs, thereby consolidating the proletarian dictatorship and forever executing Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and carrying the socialist revolution through to the end.

After the issuance of the "Several Regulations on Seriously Transforming Work Style by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee," the members of various levels of revolutionary committees and the leaders of various revolutionary mass organizations in our province are studying and implementing the regulations with the spirit of rectification. This is very good. However, some comrades have not paid enough attention. It must be pointed out that the ten measures in the regulations are not minor matters of personal conduct but major political principles, relating to the establishment of a proletarian and revolutionary leadership cadre, relating to whether we can execute Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and relating to whether we can maintain our proletarian character. We must learn from the revolutionary spirit of the Shanghai proletarian revolutionary comrades, who act swiftly and decisively, and unconditionally implement the regulations.

It is particularly important to note that the process of learning and implementing the regulations is a process of breaking down selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, transforming our worldview. If we put "public" first, we can learn seriously and act decisively, with no obstacles in our thoughts and no wavering in our actions. If we put "self" first, constantly thinking about fame, power, enjoyment, and comfort, we will inevitably fail to learn and act. Therefore, the members of various levels of revolutionary committees and the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations must study and apply Chairman Mao's works, further carry out rectification, break down selfishness and establish public-mindedness, and transform our thoughts, establishing the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds. Only in this way can we fundamentally transform our work style, achieve the ideological revolutionization of the leadership, and further consolidate the proletarian dictatorship.

### 巨大的关怀、鼓舞和鞭策

　　巨大的关怀、鼓舞和鞭策
　　山东《大众日报》六月二十六日社论
    《红旗》杂志一九六七年第十期发表了《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》，同时发表了题为《防止资产阶级思想侵蚀》的评论员文章。这是毛主席和党中央对我省无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的巨大关怀、鼓舞和鞭策。
    《红旗》杂志评论员文章和《规定》发表后，上海市革命委员会立即召开扩大会议，热烈讨论和学习了《规定》，并通过了《坚决学习和贯彻〈山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定〉》的决定；《文汇报》、《解放日报》还分别发表社论。这也是上海无产阶级革命派对我们的支持和鞭策。上海无产阶级革命派战友们这种雷厉风行的革命精神，为我们作出了学习的榜样。我们必须认真向上海战友学习，严格地、不折不扣地执行《规定》，永远忠于毛主席，忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的革命路线。毛主席怎么说，我们就怎么做。
    无产阶级革命派当权以后，地位发生了变化，在这种情况下，一个十分尖锐的问题，摆在我们面前：是进一步活学活用毛主席著作，“继续地保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁的作风”，“继续地保持艰苦奋斗的作风”，将革命进行到底呢？还是为资产阶级思想作风所腐蚀，躺在“胜利的安乐椅”上，舒舒服服地“和平演变”，使无产阶级的政权重新被资产阶级篡夺呢？
    必须懂得，胜利对于无产阶级革命派，是一种新的严峻考验。如果放松思想改造，躺在“胜利的安乐椅”上舒舒服服地干革命，那就会舒舒服服地“和平演变”，滑到修正主义道路上去，重蹈党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的覆辙。
    毛主席教导我们：“社会的发展到了今天的时代，正确地认识世界和改造世界的责任，已经历史地落在无产阶级及其政党的肩上。”“无产阶级和革命人民改造世界的斗争，包括实现下述的任务：改造客观世界，也改造自己的主观世界——改造自己的认识能力，改造主观世界同客观世界的关系。”无产阶级革命派，要担负起历史的重担，必须大树毛泽东思想的绝对权威，高度警惕资产阶级糖衣炮弹的攻击，不断地自觉地以毛泽东思想为武器，改造自己的思想，防止资产阶级思想侵蚀，永保无产阶级本色。在夺权斗争取得胜利之后，务必继续保持谦虚、谨慎、不骄、不躁，艰苦奋斗的作风，“做无产阶级和人民大众的‘牛’，鞠躬尽瘁，死而后已。”“官”，对于我们无产阶级革命派来说，不意味着特权、享受、“民众的上司”，而应该是“无产阶级和人民大众的‘牛’，是勤勤恳恳为人民服务的勤务员。只有由这样的人形成的领导班子，才是真正的无产阶级的领导班子，才能实现领导机关革命化，从而巩固无产阶级专政，永远执行毛主席的革命路线，把社会主义革命进行到底。
    《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》发出后，我省各级革命委员会成员和各革命群众组织的负责人，正在以整风的精神，认真学习和贯彻执行，这是很好的。但是，有些同志还没有引起足够的重视。必须指出，《规定》的十条措施，决不是生活小节，而是重大的政治性的原则问题，是关系到建立一个无产阶级的、革命化的领导班子的问题，关系到能不能执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，能不能保持无产阶级本色的问题。我们必须学习上海无产阶级革命派战友那种雷厉风行的革命精神，不折不扣地贯彻执行《规定》。
    特别应该指出的是，学习、贯彻《规定》的过程，就是一个破私立公，改造世界观的过程。“公”字当头，就能够学得认真，做得坚决，思想上没挡头，行动上不动摇；“私”字当头，念念不忘名、权、享受、安逸，就必然会学不进，行不通。因此，各级革命委员会成员和革命群众组织负责人，必须活学活用毛主席著作，进一步开展整风，破私立公，改造自己的思想，在头脑里树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威。这样，才能从根本上转变作风，实现领导的思想革命化，进一步巩固无产阶级专政。
