The editorial board of the *Red Flag* magazine notes: The great unity of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat is a crucial condition for carrying the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end. In the process of achieving this great unity, the struggle between the proletarian worldview and the bourgeois worldview, that is, the struggle between public and private interests, runs through the revolutionary organizations of the proletariat. The article "To Achieve Revolutionary Great Unity, We Must Overthrow the Selfish 'I'" vividly illustrates this point.

The experience of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Sixth Loading and Unloading District of the Shanghai Port Bureau tells us that the selfish "I" is the ideological enemy in the great unity of the revolution. Only by overcoming selfishness and establishing public-mindedness, by overthrowing the selfish "I" and putting public interests first, by raising high the invincible banner of Mao Zedong Thought, can we achieve and consolidate the great unity of the revolution.

We recommend this article and hope that all revolutionary organizations will sum up their own experiences and promote the great unity of the revolution.

In November of last year, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Sixth Loading and Unloading District of the Shanghai Port Bureau broke through numerous obstacles and "came out." They successively established the Port Six Rebel Corps, the East Red Rebel Corps, the Rebel Brigade, the Red Flag Brigade, the Red Rebellion Brigade Port Six Column, and five other revolutionary mass organizations.

These revolutionary mass organizations, in the battles to smash the new counterattacks of the bourgeois reactionary line, to counterattack the conservative organizations manipulated by a handful of capitalists within the old municipal committee, and to stop the counter-revolutionary economic wind, stood together in life and death, shared hardships, united and fought together, and merged into a revolutionary torrent.

These revolutionary mass organizations began to unite from January of this year until the establishment of the unified revolutionary organization—the Revolutionary Rebel Committee of the Sixth District of the Shanghai Port—after experiencing three major unifications. There are profound experiences and lessons to be learned.

The First Great Unity

The great "January Revolution" storm swept across the entire port. The proletarian revolutionary masses of the Sixth District also seized all the power of the party, government, finance, and culture at this time, courageously shouldering the dual burdens of revolution and production. The eight revolutionary mass organizations united for the first time, establishing revolutionary production groups.

Having seized power, the status of the proletarian revolutionary masses also changed. In this new situation, some people relaxed their self-reform and did not follow the instructions of Comrade Lin Biao. Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "We must regard ourselves as a force for the revolution, and at the same time, we must constantly regard ourselves as the object of the revolution. The revolution must also revolutionize ourselves. If we do not revolutionize ourselves, the revolution will not be successful." However, some revolutionary comrades put the selfish "I" first, starting from the interests of small groups, grabbing at trivial issues among themselves, entangling and arguing endlessly. Some people with ulterior motives saw an opportunity and secretly fanned the flames, expanding contradictions and creating divisions. The "internal wars" without principles between the various revolutionary mass organizations thus began, especially between the two organizations that "came out" earlier—the Rebel Corps of the "Workers' General Headquarters" and the East Red Rebel Corps of the "Workers' General Headquarters"—which were more prominent, each saying the other's direction was wrong, "internal war" big-character posters plastered throughout the district.

Thus, the proletarian revolutionary masses who had just seized power, due to the selfish "I" in their minds and the sabotage by some people with ulterior motives, fought an "internal war," disrupting the class line, shifting the direction of the struggle, and the revolutionary production group, which had only been united for about a month, perished.

The Second Great Unity

Several dozen days of "internal war" caused unnecessary losses to the revolution, and everyone was exhausted from fighting. They felt that if they did not stop the "internal war," they would let down Chairman Mao, the Central Committee of the Party, and the revolutionary masses.

Just at this critical moment, the *Notice from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to the Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres of All Factories, Mines, and Enterprises in the Country* was issued, and the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee made a resolution on the current situation and tasks of the Cultural Revolution in Shanghai, timely bringing Mao Zedong's latest instructions. They further compared their thoughts, studied Mao Zedong's brilliant works *On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People*, *Rectifying the Party's Style*, and *On Correcting Erroneous Ideas Within the Party*, and thus, both sides had an epiphany and could sit down calmly to think about the problems.

The eight mass organizations in the Sixth District are all revolutionary organizations. Everyone is a class brother. The direction of the struggle has always been consistent, united and fighting together, winning together. Why, after seizing power, did they cling to small hills and not unite? Through study, everyone initially realized that this was due to the selfish "I" in their minds. If they did not overthrow the selfish "I," the proletarian revolutionary masses would not carry out the great unity, and they would make a big mistake.

Thus, on March 21, an agreement was reached to form a preparatory group for the Revolutionary Committee of the Sixth District of the Shanghai Port, composed of representatives of the proletarian revolutionary masses, revolutionary leading cadres, the military region, and public security personnel. Later, it developed into the preparatory committee of the Revolutionary Committee, thus initially having a command structure for seizing the revolution and promoting production.

After the preparatory committee was established, the various revolutionary mass organizations in the Sixth District united organizationally. However, because they did not thoroughly study and apply Chairman Mao's works, touch the soul, overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness, but were afraid of conservatives taking the opportunity to counterattack, afraid of being criticized for shortcomings and exaggerated, afraid of internal divisions, afraid of causing another "internal war," etc., they turned open rectification into closed-door rectification or semi-open rectification. In the rectification process, they criticized others more, and even spoke with hidden barbs, without strictly demanding of themselves. As a result, they only smoothed out the relationships between the organizations, exposed the problems, only turned the "internal war" from big-character posters to tabletop arguments. The contradictions and differences between organizations and within organizations were not truly resolved ideologically.

At this time, some conservative organizations spread rumors, saying things like "the revolutionary faction in the Sixth District seized power in the wrong direction," and even publicly shouted in front of the Rebel Corps, "Only the left can rebel, the right cannot rebel," directing the spearhead at the proletarian revolutionary masses. Following this, the "temporary party committee" fabricated by the work team implementing the bourgeois reactionary line restored its activities according to the old methods, openly playing counterpoint to the preparatory committee, causing the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the Sixth District to relapse once again. It was not until the responsible comrades of the Municipal Revolutionary Committee came to the district to labor, conduct investigations, and research that they ordered the cessation of all activities of the "temporary party committee."

This relapse deeply educated us that the selfish "I" in the minds of the proletarian revolutionary masses is an obstacle to achieving great unity. The proletarian revolutionary masses must achieve and consolidate the great unity and the "three-in-one combination," seize power well, hold power well, and use power well, by raising high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, touching the soul, thoroughly overcoming selfishness, and establishing public-mindedness. Otherwise, the movement will relapse.

The Third Great Unity

Two unifications, two failures, gave them many experiences and lessons. Everyone understood that they must overthrow the selfish "I" and achieve great unity on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought. If they only united in form but not in thought, it would be the most unreliable and baseless. Therefore, the masses said this kind of unity was "parliamentary unity," saying the preparatory committee was a "club of endless arguments." This was a profound and sharp criticism!

Just when the movement in the Sixth District was stagnant, our most beloved great leader Chairman Mao sent the People's Liberation Army. The PLA, following Chairman Mao's teaching that "all conclusions come at the end of the investigation of the situation, not at the beginning," conducted in-depth and detailed investigations and research. They ran all day in the production sites, where there were difficulties, there were the PLA. In the dead of night, they held the hands of night-shift workers and had heart-to-heart talks. In the scorching sun of the ship's hold, they loaded and unloaded with vigor. Whenever the masses talked about the PLA, everyone gave a thumbs up, saying, "They are truly our good examples!"

More importantly, the PLA brought Mao Zedong Thought. With the help of the PLA comrades, all the workers in the district carried out the movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works in five ways: "five greats"—greatly study, greatly speak, greatly recite, greatly sing, and greatly use Mao Zedong Thought. Many comrades recited the "Three Constantly Read Articles," read language records at work, and checked their work against the language records after work.

On the basis of greatly studying Chairman Mao's works, the Sixth District launched a high tide of criticism, with all revolutionary workers fiercely criticizing the biggest capitalist-roader in the party and fiercely criticizing *Self-Cultivation*.

At the same time as the criticism, they also organized mid-level cadres to study. Because the criticism exposed the cover of class struggle, many deceived cadres awakened, checked their mistakes, and spoke from the heart. Some said, "In the previous period, my attitude was bad, mainly because I was afraid of being criticized, afraid of being overthrown, afraid of losing my official hat." Most cadres realized their mistakes and returned to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

After a month of study, the issue returned to great unity. How should great unity be achieved? The masses told the responsible comrades of the revolutionary organizations, "We want great unity, the faster the better. The key now is on you few leaders." Some comrades said, "Whether you unite or not up there, we will unite at the grassroots level." An old worker spoke earnestly, "I am a Communist Party member. In the old society, I suffered enough. Now, a handful of capitalist-roaders in the party want us to go back, we firmly do not agree. We want to unite and fight against them. Why can't we unite? What can't we give up?" This old worker is right. For the sake of our country not changing color, for the sake of the world revolution, what can't we give up? What reason do we have not to achieve great unity?

Chairman Mao teaches us: "Countless revolutionary martyrs sacrificed their lives for the people's interests, making every one of us who is alive feel sad when we think of them. Can we still have personal interests that we cannot sacrifice, can we still have errors that we cannot abandon?" The revolutionary situation requires us to achieve great unity, the proletarian revolutionary cause requires us to achieve great unity, the masses eagerly hope for great unity, and the PLA comrades have spared no effort to help us achieve great unity. The revolutionary great unity of the Sixth District of the Shanghai Port is in a good situation, very good!

On June 2, the Shanghai Revolutionary Committee made a resolution *To Struggle for the Strengthening of the Dictatorship of the Proletariat*. The proletarian revolutionary masses of the Sixth District organized a study session. On June 14, the PLA comrades gave a guidance report on studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles" to the responsible comrades of the various revolutionary mass organizations. He enthusiastically talked about the importance of studying the "Three Constantly Read Articles," from "completely" and "thoroughly" serving the people, talked about the correct attitude towards criticism and self-criticism, accepting criticism; from why to overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness, talked about how to overcome selfishness and establish public-mindedness. Everyone was deeply moved, and their thoughts quickly changed. Some comrades said, "Why, when we 'came out' from the white terror, were we not afraid of death, but now we are entangled in the selfish 'I' and cannot let go?" The study of the "Three Constantly Read Articles" opened the door to great unity, touching the soul of each person. Everyone said that the contradictions within the mass organizations, no matter how big, were not as big as the contradictions with a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party. Everyone agreed that great unity was urgent and that a unified revolutionary organization should be established immediately. After the meeting, each organization held a meeting. The Rebel Corps talked all night, they compared themselves with Chairman Mao's works, made self-criticisms, and checked their shortcomings and errors. They firmly guaranteed that they would truly achieve revolutionary great unity.

Following this, the various revolutionary mass organizations carried out rectification again. In the past, they also carried out rectification, but it was always directed at others. This time, the cannon was not aimed at others but at the selfish "I" in their own minds, carrying out thorough self-criticism. In the past, they would shake their heads when others raised opinions, now they feared that others would not raise opinions; in the past, they would argue red-faced when opinions were sharp, now they only feared that the opinions raised by others were not painful or touching the soul; in the past, they would be tense when self-criticism was mentioned, now they opened their minds and felt light-hearted. At the meeting, everyone opened their minds, did not fear ugliness, cut off their tails, and did not fear pain. The East Red Rebel Corps spoke from the heart, saying, "We looked down on the Rebel Corps, always thinking we were superior, and we did not let go of their mistakes, exaggerating them. Some problems we clearly knew they were wrong but did not say so, instead we attacked. We thought, your mistake is yours, we did right, and our reputation would be loud. Now, upon review, it was very wrong." The comrades of the Rebel Corps said, "We were not humble enough, had a mountain-head mentality, looked down on brother organizations, we smashed the Sixth Brigade, although we also made a check, but that check was superficial. In the letter of apology, we only said they were a mass organization, not even adding the word 'revolutionary.' This was to prepare to smash them again. Now, thinking about it, it is shameful and heartbreaking." Everyone talked about how we were all victims of the bourgeois reactionary line, sharing life and death in the white terror, coming out together. When fighting against conservative organizations, we hugged tightly. Now why can't we unite? Everyone unanimously recognized that they must start from the interests of the proletarian revolution when dealing with brother organizations and must not start from the interests of small groups. The differences between the various revolutionary organizations are internal contradictions among the people and should not be treated as hostile. They must be resolved according to Chairman Mao's teaching of unity—criticism—unity. Everyone talked about their experiences, spoke from the heart, and felt that there was no contradiction that could not be resolved.

In addition to holding meetings for rectification, they also adopted the method of door-to-door rectification. Everyone felt that due to the previous "internal war," many barriers had arisen between them. To achieve great unity, they must thoroughly eliminate these barriers and, between organizations and between individuals, speak from the heart and sincerely conduct self-examination. Thus, the Rebel Corps went to the East Red Rebel Corps, delivering self-criticism to the doorstep. The East Red Rebel Corps wrote on a large blackboard, "Welcome old comrades-in-arms to criticize." One went to self-criticize, and the other wanted others to criticize themselves. Everyone competed to talk about their shortcomings, the more they talked, the more intimate they became, the more they talked, the more harmonious they became.

Through the study and application of Chairman Mao's works and open rectification, the awareness of the proletarian revolutionary masses greatly increased. Thus, the Revolutionary Rebel Committee of the Workers of the Sixth District of the Shanghai Port was born. The birth of this unified organization is the victory of overthrowing the selfish "I." Ultimately, it is the great victory of Mao Zedong Thought. All credit goes to the great leader Chairman Mao, all credit goes to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

### 实现革命的大联合必须打倒私字

　　实现革命的大联合必须打倒私字
    《红旗》杂志编者按：无产阶级革命派的大联合，是把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的一个最重要的条件。在实现革命大联合的过程中，无产阶级革命组织内部贯穿着无产阶级世界观和资产阶级世界观的斗争，即公与私的斗争。本刊转载的《实现革命的大联合必须打倒私字》一文，生动地证明了这一点。
    上海港务局第六装卸区无产阶级革命派的经验告诉我们，私字是革命大联合中的思想上的大敌。只有破私立公，打倒私字，公字当头，用战无不胜的毛泽东思想挂帅，才能实现和巩固革命的大联合。
    我们推荐这篇文章，希望各革命组织，很好地总结自己的经验，推进革命的大联合。
    去年十一月间，上海港务局第六装卸区无产阶级革命派，冲破重重阻力，“杀”了出来。相继建立了港六造反大队、东方红造反队、造反兵团、红旗兵团、红色暴动兵团港六纵队等八个革命群众组织。
    这些革命群众组织，在粉碎资产阶级反动路线新反扑的战斗中，在反击旧市委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所操纵的保守组织的围攻中，在煞住反革命经济主义歪风的斗争中，同生死，共患难，团结在一起，战斗在一起，汇成一股革命的洪流。
    这些革命群众组织，从今年一月份开始联合，直到这次建立统一的革命组织——上港六区革命造反委员会，先后经过三次大联合，有深刻的经验教训。
    第一次大联合
    伟大的“一月革命”风暴席卷整个海港，六区无产阶级革命派也在这时把全区党、政、财、文大权夺了过来，勇敢地挑起革命和生产两副重担。八个革命群众组织第一次联合起来，建立了革命生产小组。
    夺了权，无产阶级革命派的地位也随着发生了变化。在这个新的形势下，有些人放松了自我改造，没有遵照林彪同志的指示去做。林彪同志指出：“我们要把自己当作革命的一份力量，同时又要不断地把自己当作革命的对象。革命，也得革自己的命。不革自己的命，这个革命是搞不好的。”而有的革命派同志却私字当头，从小团体利益出发，彼此间抓住一些枝节问题，纠缠不放，争论不休。一些别有用心的人看到有机可乘，就在暗地里煽阴风，点鬼火，扩大矛盾，制造分裂。各革命群众组织之间无原则的“内战”也就此开始，尤其是两个“杀”出来比较早的组织——“工总司”造反大队和“工总司”东方红造反队更为突出，相互看不惯，你说我大方向错了，我说你大方向不对，“内战”的大字报贴遍全区。
    这样，刚刚掌了权的无产阶级革命派，由于自己头脑里私字作怪，由于一些别有用心的人进行破坏，打起一场“内战”，搅乱了阶级阵线，转移了斗争大方向，革命生产小组仅仅联合了一个月左右就夭折了。
    第二次大联合
    几十天的“内战”，给革命造成不应有的损失，大家也打得精疲力竭。他们感到，如再不停止“内战”，就对不起毛主席、党中央和革命群众。
    就在这关键的时刻，《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》发表了，上海市革命委员会就当前上海文化大革命的形势和任务作了决议，及时地送来了毛主席的最新指示。他们又进一步对照自己的思想，学习了毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《整顿党的作风》、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作，于是，双方都开了窍，能够坐下来冷静地思考问题了。
    六区的八个群众组织，都是革命组织。大家都是阶级兄弟。过去斗争的大方向一直是一致的，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。为什么夺了权以后，却死抱住小山头联合不起来呢？经过学习，大家初步认识到，这是由于自己头脑里私字在作怪，如果不打倒私字，无产阶级革命派再不实行大联合，自己就要犯大错误。
    于是，在三月二十一日达成协议，由无产阶级革命派、革命领导干部、武装部与公安人员代表组成上港六区革命委员会筹备小组。后来，又发展成为革命委员会筹备委员会，这样，就初步有了抓革命、促生产的指挥机构。
    筹委会成立以后，六区各个革命群众组织在组织上联合起来了。但是，由于没有很好地活学活用毛主席著作，狠触灵魂，破私立公，而是怕字当头，怕保守势力乘机反扑，怕别人抓住缺点无限上纲，搞垮自己，怕内部分裂，怕再引起“内战”等等，使开门整风变成关门整风，或者半开门整风。在整风过程中，批评别人多，甚至话中带刺，没有严格要求自己。结果，只是疏通了各组织之间的关系，摆出了问题，只是使“内战”的形式从大字报转到桌面上的争论。而组织之间、组织内部的矛盾和分歧并没有真正从思想上得到解决。
    这时，一些保守组织散布流言蜚语，说什么“六区造反派夺权大方向错了”，甚至在造反大队门前公开叫嚷“只准左派造反，不准右派翻天”，把矛头指向无产阶级革命派。接着，由执行资产阶级反动路线的工作队一手炮制的“临时党委”按照旧的一套恢复了活动，公开和筹委会唱对台戏，使六区无产阶级文化大革命又一次出现了反复。当市革命委员会负责同志来区劳动，进行调查研究之后，才下令停止“临时党委”的一切活动。
    这一次的反复，深深地教育了我们，无产阶级革命派头脑里的私字是实现大联合的障碍。无产阶级革命派要实现和巩固革命的大联合和“三结合”，夺好权，掌好权，用好权，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，狠触灵魂，大破私字，大立公字。否则，就会使运动出现反复。
    第三次大联合
    两次联合，两次失败，使他们取得了不少的经验教训。大家懂得了，必须打倒私字，在毛泽东思想的基础上实现大联合，才是最巩固的革命大联合。如果只是形式上联合，而思想上没有联合，是最不牢靠的，最没有基础的。因此，群众说这种联合是“议会式的联合”，说筹委会是“争吵不休的俱乐部”。这是多么深刻而又尖锐的批评啊！
    正当六区的运动处于停滞不前的时候，我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席，派来了中国人民解放军。解放军遵循毛主席“一切结论产生于调查情况的末尾，而不是在它的先头”的教导，进行深入细致的调查研究。他们整天奔走在生产现场，那里有困难，那里就有解放军。在深更半夜的时候，他们拉着夜班工人的手，促膝谈心。在烈日当头的船舱里，他们生龙活虎般地抢装抢卸。群众一谈起解放军，个个竖起大拇指说：“真是我们的好榜样！”
    更重要的是解放军带来了毛泽东思想。在解放军同志的帮助下，全区职工用“五大”开展活学活用毛主席著作运动。“五大”就是：大学毛主席著作，大讲毛主席著作，大背毛主席著作，大唱毛主席语录歌，大用毛泽东思想。许多同志背诵“老三篇”，上班读语录，下班对照语录检查工作。
    在大学毛主席著作的基础上，六区掀起了大批判的高潮，全体革命职工狠批党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，狠批《修养》。
    在大批判的同时，他们还组织了中层干部学习。由于大批判揭开了阶级斗争盖子，使许多受蒙蔽的干部觉醒过来，检查了自己的错误。他们说出了心里话，有的说：“前一时期态度不好，主要是怕整到自己头上，怕打倒，怕丢乌纱帽。”大多数干部认识到自己的错误，回到了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。
    经过一个来月的学习，问题又回到大联合。大联合究竟怎么办？群众对革命组织的负责人说：“我们要大联合，联合得越快越好，现在的关键，就在你们几个头头身上。”有的同志说：“不管你们上面联合不联合，我们下面要搞部门联合了。”一个老工人语重心长地说：“我是共产党员，在旧社会里，我吃够了苦头，现在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派要我们走回头路，我们坚决不答应，我们要联合起来同他们斗争。我们为什么不联合呢？有什么东西丢不掉呢？”这个老工人说得对。为了使我们的国家不变颜色，为了世界革命，我们有什么东西丢不掉呢？我们有什么理由不搞大联合呢？
    毛主席教导我们：“无数革命先烈为了人民的利益牺牲了他们的生命，使我们每个活着的人想起他们就心里难过，难道我们还有什么个人利益不能牺牲，还有什么错误不能抛弃吗？”革命形势需要我们大联合，无产阶级革命事业需要我们大联合，群众殷切期望大联合，解放军同志费尽心血帮助我们大联合，上港六区的革命大联合，形势很好，好得很！
    六月二日，上海市革命委员会作了《为加强无产阶级专政而斗争》的决议。六区无产阶级革命派组织了学习。六月十四日，解放军同志对各革命群众组织负责人作了学习“老三篇”辅导报告，他畅谈学习“老三篇”的重要意义，从“完全”、“彻底”为人民服务，谈到正确对待批评与自我批评，接受批评的态度；从为什么要破私立公，谈到怎样破私立公。大家听了非常感动，思想迅速发生转变。有的同志说：“为什么从白色恐怖中‘杀’出来的时候连死都不怕，现在却纠缠在私字上丢不开呢？”“老三篇”的学习打开了大联合的大门，触动了每个人的灵魂。大家都说，群众组织的矛盾再大，总大不过同党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的矛盾。一致认为大联合刻不容缓，应该立即成立统一的革命组织。会后，各个组织都开了会。造反大队谈了一夜，他们对照毛主席著作，作了自我批评，检查自己的缺点错误。他们坚决保证，要真正实现革命的大联合。
    接着，各革命群众组织又进行了整风。以往他们也整过风，但都是向别人开炮，这次开炮不是对准别人，而是对准自己头脑里的私字，狠狠地自我批评。过去一听别人提意见就摇头，现在唯恐别人不提意见；过去意见一尖锐就争得面红耳赤，现在只怕别人提的意见不疼不痒，不触及灵魂；过去一提自我批评就紧张，现在亮了思想，感到一身轻松。在会上，大家亮思想，不怕丑，割尾巴，不怕疼。东方红造反队说出了心里话，他们说：“我们对造反大队看不惯，总以为自己水平高，对他们的错误抓住不放，上纲又上纲。有的问题我们明明知道他们错了也不说，反而去轰。我们想，你错是你的，我们做对了，名气就当当响。现在检查起来是很错误的。”造反大队的同志说：“我们不够虚心，有山头主义，看不起兄弟组织，我们砸了六兵团，虽然也作了检查，可是，那次检查是表面的，我们在道歉书上只说他们是群众组织，连革命两个字都不肯加，这样做是准备以后再去砸。现在想想真惭愧，真痛心。”大家谈到，我们都是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，在白色恐怖中同生死，共患难，一同“杀”了出来。同保守组织斗争时，我们抱得紧紧的。现在为什么不能联合起来？大家一致认识到，对待兄弟组织一定要从无产阶级革命利益出发，决不应从小团体利益出发。各革命组织之间的分歧，是人民内部矛盾，不应该采取敌对态度，一定要按照毛主席所教导的团结——批评——团结的方法去解决。大家谈体会，讲心里话，觉得没有什么矛盾解决不了的。
    除开会整风之外，他们又采取上门整风的办法。大家觉得，由于前一时期打“内战”，相互之间发生了许多隔阂，要搞好大联合，必须彻底消除这些隔阂，必须在组织与组织之间，个人与个人之间推心置腹，谈心里话，诚心诚意地进行自我检查。于是，造反大队到东方红造反队去，把自我批评送上门。东方红造反队用大黑板写着：“欢迎老战友批评。”一个去自我批评，一个要别人批评自己，大家争着谈自己的缺点，越谈越亲热，越谈越融洽。
    经过活学活用毛主席著作，开门整风，使无产阶级革命派的觉悟大大提高。于是，上港六区工人革命造反委员会诞生了。这个统一组织的诞生，是打倒私字的胜利。归根到底，是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。一切归功于伟大领袖毛主席，一切归功于战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
