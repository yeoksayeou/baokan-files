	Emphasize Self-Criticism
	Beijing Municipality, Pinggu County, Huangsongyu People's Commune, Armed Forces Department Cadre, Pang Yongliang

	Recently, in our commune's eleven production brigades, ten brigades' revolutionary factions had united, but the Black Bean Gully Brigade's revolutionary faction, due to past misunderstandings with other revolutionary organizations, had not joined. At this time, some comrades in power had erroneous thoughts, believing that when the revolutionary faction was not very strong, a great alliance was needed, but now that they were "strong," there was no need for a great alliance. Therefore, they did not proactively work on uniting the Black Bean Gully Brigade's revolutionary faction, nor did they conduct strict self-criticism. The disagreements between the two sides grew larger, the problems became more severe, and it affected the smooth progress of seizing the revolution and promoting production.

	The boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought is forever our guiding beacon. At this moment, we studied "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." Chairman Mao taught us: "In front of us, there are two types of social contradictions: those between the enemy and us, and those among the people. These are two types of contradictions with completely different natures." "The methods of resolving these two types of contradictions are also different. To put it simply, the former is about distinguishing between the enemy and us, while the latter is about distinguishing right from wrong." After studying Chairman Mao's teachings, we sat down to specifically analyze the contradictions, analyze the situation of the Black Bean Gully Red Guards Headquarters, and also analyze our own situation. Everyone agreed: the Black Bean Gully Red Guards were established with poor and lower-middle peasants as the backbone, and the organization's several leaders all came from poor peasant families. They had deep hatred for the old society and the capitalist-roaders in power; they had boundless love for the new society and for the great leader Chairman Mao. They were the most resolute in fighting the capitalist-roaders within the party and the unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. Their general direction was always correct, and they were a steadfast revolutionary organization. Then why did contradictions arise, and why were they unwilling to join the revolutionary great alliance? Everyone agreed there were two reasons: First, our power-seizing organization indeed had some shortcomings and mistakes, especially after seizing power, there was a sense of pride and complacency, looking down on other revolutionary organizations, which was reflected in the words and deeds of some comrades, causing the leaders of the Black Bean Gully Red Guards Headquarters to feel displeased. Second, in the previous stage, the Black Bean Gully Red Guards Headquarters did a lot of work in mobilizing the masses, exposing the capitalist-roaders within the party, and fighting the unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements, achieving certain results. Some people also developed a sense of pride, believing that Black Bean Gully was one of the largest villages in the commune, and that without the participation of Black Bean Gully's revolutionary faction, the commune's problems could not be solved, and even if solved, it would not count.

	Based on this analysis, everyone agreed that although the Black Bean Gully Red Guards Headquarters did not participate in the revolutionary great alliance, this was not separate from our shortcomings and mistakes; both sides were responsible. But where was the main aspect of the contradiction? Chairman Mao said: "In the two contradictory aspects, one must be the main aspect, and the other the secondary aspect. The main aspect is the aspect that plays a leading role in the contradiction." We are now the side in power, and in the issue of causing contradictions and not being able to achieve the revolutionary great alliance, we should take the main responsibility; to resolve this contradiction, we should take the initiative. How to resolve the contradiction? It was still Chairman Mao's works that gave us the weapons. Chairman Mao taught us that for the people, "it is not by coercive methods but by democratic methods, that is, they must participate in political activities, not be coerced to do this or that, but be educated and persuaded by democratic methods. This educational work is the work of self-education among the people, and the method of criticism and self-criticism is the basic method of self-education."

	Following Chairman Mao's teachings, we proactively went to the Black Bean Gully Red Guards Headquarters to study and discuss with them. The "Sixteen Points" pointed out: "Revolutionary comrades, on the premise of a consistent major direction, should not argue endlessly over minor issues, so as to strengthen unity." Both sides felt: wasn't this exactly about us? Previously, everyone thought the other side's major direction was correct, but just held onto minor issues, affecting the revolutionary great alliance. At this time, the several units that seized power proactively checked their shortcomings and mistakes before and after seizing power, expressing their determination to correct the shortcomings and mistakes and to unite with the Black Bean Gully revolutionary faction to fight together. At the same time, they sincerely requested them to criticize us. The comrades from the Black Bean Gully Red Guards Headquarters saw our sincere attitude and genuine intention to unite with them, so they no longer insisted on not participating in the revolutionary great alliance, and proactively checked their own sectarianism and pride. Both sides agreed to firmly strengthen the unity among revolutionary factions, oppose sectarianism, oppose splits, firmly grasp the major direction of struggle, and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end.

	Since then, the revolutionary factions with the broad poor and lower-middle peasants as the core in our commune's eleven brigades achieved the revolutionary great alliance. Following the major direction of struggle indicated by Chairman Mao, they severely struck down the handful of capitalist-roaders within the party and the unrepentant landlords, rich peasants, counter-revolutionaries, and bad elements. In the great struggle of seizing the revolution and promoting production, they achieved one victory after another.

　　着重自我批评
　　北京市平谷县黄松峪公社武装部干事　庞永亮
    前些时，在我们公社十一个大队中，有十个大队的革命派联合起来了，只有黑豆峪大队的革命派，因为过去和其他革命组织之间有过一些误会，没有联合。这时，在掌权的一部分同志中就产生了错误思想，认为在革命派的队伍不是很强大时，需要搞大联合，现在自己已经很“强大”了，就不需要搞大联合了。因此，就不主动地做黑豆峪大队革命派的团结工作，也不进行严格的自我批评，双方的意见分歧越来越大，问题越来越严重，影响抓革命、促生产的顺利进行。
    光焰无际的毛泽东思想永远是我们的指路明灯。就在这个时候，我们学习了《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》。毛主席教导我们说：“在我们的面前有两类社会矛盾，这就是敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾。这是性质完全不同的两类矛盾。”“敌我之间和人民内部这两类矛盾的性质不同，解决的方法也不同。简单地说起来，前者是分清敌我的问题，后者是分清是非的问题。”学习了毛主席的教导，我们就坐下来具体地分析矛盾，分析黑豆峪红卫兵总部的情况，也分析了我们的情况。大家认为：黑豆峪红卫兵是以贫下中农为骨干建立起来的，这个组织的几个负责人都出身在贫下中农家庭，他们对旧社会，对走资本主义道路的当权派有着刻骨的仇恨；对新社会，对伟大领袖毛主席无限的热爱。他们斗争党内走资本主义道路的当权派，斗争没有改造好的地、富、反、坏分子最坚决，大方向一直是正确的，是个坚定的革命派组织。那么为什么又会产生矛盾，不愿搞革命的大联合呢？大家一致认为有两方面的原因：首先，是我们夺权的组织确实存在一些缺点和错误，特别是掌权后，产生了骄傲自满情绪，看不起其他革命派组织，在部分同志的言行中流露出来，引起黑豆峪红卫兵总部的负责人的反感。其次，前一阶段黑豆峪红卫兵总部在发动群众方面，做了很多工作，揪出了党内走资本主义道路的当权派，斗争了没有改造好的地、富、反、坏分子，取得了一定的成绩。有些人也产生了骄傲情绪，认为黑豆峪是公社数一数二的大村，解决公社的问题没有黑豆峪的革命派参加，就不能解决，解决了也不算数。
    根据这样的分析，大家一致认为，黑豆峪红卫兵总部不参加革命的大联合固然不对，但是这同我们的缺点、错误是分不开的，双方都有责任。但是，矛盾的主要方面在那里呢？毛主席说：“矛盾着的两方面中，必有一方面是主要的，他方面是次要的。其主要的方面，即所谓矛盾起主导作用的方面。”我们现在是掌权的一方，在闹矛盾、不能实现革命的大联合的问题上，我们要负主要责任；要解决这个矛盾，我们应该采取主动的态度。怎样解决矛盾呢？还是毛主席著作给了我们武器。毛主席教导我们说，对人民说来，“不是用强迫的方法，而是用民主的方法，就是说必须让他们参与政治活动，不是强迫他们做这样做那样，而是用民主的方法向他们进行教育和说服的工作。这种教育工作是人民内部的自我教育工作，批评和自我批评的方法就是自我教育的基本方法。”
    按照毛主席的教导，我们主动地到黑豆峪红卫兵总部去和他们一起学习，一起讨论。“十六条”中指出：“革命的同志，在大方向一致的前提下，不要在枝节问题上争论不休，以便加强团结。”双方都认为：这不正是说的自己吗？以前谁都认为对方的大方向是正确的，但就是抓住枝节问题不放，影响了革命的大联合。这时，我们夺权的几个单位主动地检查了在夺权前后所存在的缺点、错误，表示要坚决改正缺点、错误，要和黑豆峪革命派联合起来共同战斗的决心。同时，诚恳地要求他们对我们进行批评。黑豆峪红卫兵总部的同志看到我们态度诚恳，真心实意地和他们联合，就不再坚持不参加革命的大联合的意见了，而且主动地检查了自己存在的小团体主义和骄傲情绪。双方一致表示，坚决加强革命派之间的团结，反对小团体主义，反对分裂，紧紧掌握斗争的大方向，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底。
    从这以后，我们公社十一个大队以广大贫下中农为核心的革命派，实现了革命的大联合，按照毛主席指示的斗争大方向，狠狠打击了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和没有改造好的地、富、反、坏分子。在抓革命、促生产的伟大斗争中，取得了一个又一个的胜利。
