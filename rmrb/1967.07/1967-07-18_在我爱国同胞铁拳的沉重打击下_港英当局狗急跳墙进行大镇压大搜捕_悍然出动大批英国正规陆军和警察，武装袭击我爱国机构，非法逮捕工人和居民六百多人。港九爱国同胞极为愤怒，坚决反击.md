Under the heavy blows of the patriotic compatriots, the Hong Kong British authorities, in desperation, resorted to massive suppression and arrests. They brazenly deployed large numbers of British regular army troops and police to launch armed attacks on patriotic organizations, illegally arresting over six hundred workers and residents. The patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon were extremely angry and resolutely fought back.

According to a dispatch from Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, July 17: The Hong Kong British fascist authorities, under the heavy blows of the Hong Kong workers and patriotic compatriots, on July 16, in desperation, brazenly deployed large numbers of British army troops, Hong Kong defense forces, British army helicopter units, and "riot control teams" to suppress and arrest patriotic trade unions, committing yet another heinous crime.

The joint strike by sixty thousand workers in Hong Kong, which began on June 10 and 24, dealt a heavy political and economic blow to the evil British imperialism. Over the past ten days, tens of thousands of patriotic compatriots from various sectors have taken to the streets, striking the dying Hong Kong British imperialism, making it frantic and anxious. In order to save its shaky reactionary rule, the Hong Kong British imperialism, on July 16, at noon and in the afternoon, brazenly deployed the British regular army's "Wales Regiment," the "Queen's Own Regiment" Second Battalion, British army helicopter units, and Hong Kong defense forces, as well as large numbers of "riot control teams." Under the command of the acting commissioner of the Hong Kong "Police Department," Mr. Idashan, and several high-ranking British army officers and senior police officers, they launched armed attacks in the To Kwa Wan district of Kowloon on the workers' club of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Trade Union Council; in the Shau Kei Wan district of Hong Kong, they attacked the welfare department of the Taikoo Dockyard Chinese Workers' Union, the welfare department of the Taikoo Sugar Refinery Chinese Workers' Union, and the Hong Kong branch of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Five Metals Industry General Union; in the Sham Shui Po district of Kowloon, they attacked the Kowloon Public Transport Division and its service department of the Motorcycle Industry Workers' Union. During the attacks on these patriotic trade union offices, the Hong Kong British military and police, disregarding the safety of nearby residents, used explosives to blow up iron doors or dug through the walls of neighboring residential buildings to enter. The Hong Kong British military and police deliberately provoked the Chinese people and patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. After entering the trade union offices, apart from conducting extensive searches and destroying internal items, they also tore down all portraits of Chairman Mao and quotations from Chairman Mao. They vilely seized the trade union's documents, money, and some items, even taking away the workers' study copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao." In addition, during the attack on the workers' club, several patriotic organizations and some residents' homes in the nearby buildings were also raided and destroyed by the Hong Kong British military and police. According to statistics released by the Hong Kong British "Information Department," the Hong Kong British fascist authorities arrested 634 workers and nearby residents during the armed attacks on July 16.

The Hong Kong British fascist authorities' massive suppression and arrests of patriotic trade unions have sparked great anger among the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon. Tens of thousands of people gathered near the three scenes of the Hong Kong British armed attacks, glaring angrily at the Hong Kong British fascist thugs, shouting "Down with British imperialism!" "Down with the running dogs!" Many people threw stones and glass bottles at the British military and police, and some used firecrackers to fight back against these fascist thugs. In other districts of Hong Kong and Kowloon, many people also took to the streets, beating up Hong Kong British police, strongly protesting against the new fascist atrocities committed by the Hong Kong British. Especially in the Wan Chai district of Hong Kong, that afternoon around four o'clock, several hundred patriotic compatriots gathered in the streets, beating up the Hong Kong British "riot control teams." Despite the Hong Kong British police firing countless tear gas canisters, wooden bullets, iron sand bullets, and carbine bullets, the brave patriotic compatriots continued to fight the savage enemy until late at night. Near the workers' club in the To Kwa Wan district of Kowloon, patriotic compatriots threw stones and glass bottles at the British military and police all night, greatly dampening the enemy's morale. The Hong Kong British fascist authorities, helpless, had to announce in the early hours of July 16 that the area near the workers' club was a "prohibited zone," deploying large numbers of military and police to guard it.

The Hong Kong British fascist authorities' massive suppression and arrests of patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong began on July 11. From July 11 to 16, the Hong Kong British armed military and police attacked 13 of our patriotic organizations, arresting over eight hundred people from patriotic organizations and nearby residents. The number of casualties is currently unknown. In addition, the Hong Kong British also brazenly kidnapped three reporters from the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch, five reporters from patriotic newspapers, and two patriotic film actors.

The enemy's massive suppression and arrests have sparked great anger among the patriotic compatriots in Hong Kong. The flames of resistance, already burning, are now burning even more fiercely, greatly promoting the arrival of a new high tide of anti-British and anti-fascist struggles.

    在我爱国同胞铁拳的沉重打击下
    港英当局狗急跳墙进行大镇压大搜捕
    悍然出动大批英国正规陆军和警察，武装袭击我爱国机构，非法逮捕工人和居民六百多人。港九爱国同胞极为愤怒，坚决反击
    据新华社香港十七日电　港英法西斯当局在香港工人和爱国同胞铁拳的沉重反击下，十六日竟狗急跳墙，悍然出动大批英国陆军、香港防卫军、英国陆军直升机队和“防暴队”，对我爱国工会进行大镇压和大搜捕，又一次犯下了新的滔天罪行。
    分别从六月十日和二十四日开始的香港六万工人联合大罢工，在政治上和经济上给万恶的英帝国主义以沉重的打击。十天来，成千上万的各界爱国同胞纷纷走上街头，把垂死的港英帝国主义打得焦头烂额，惶惶不可终日，港英帝国主义为了挽救它摇摇欲坠的反动统治，竟在十六日中午和下午，悍然出动英国正规陆军“威尔斯兵团”、“英女王团队”第二营、英国陆军直升机队和香港防卫军，以及大批“防暴队”，在港英“警务处”代理处长伊达善和几个英国陆军高级军官和高级警官的指挥下，在九龙土瓜湾区，武力袭击港九工会联合会的工人俱乐部；在香港筲箕湾区，武力袭击太古船坞华人职工会福利部、太古车糖公司华人职工会福利部和港九五金工业总工会香港分会；在九龙深水埗区，武力袭击摩托车业职工总会的九龙公共汽车分会及其服务部。港英军警在袭击这些爱国工会会所时，不顾附近居民的安全，竟然使用炸药爆破铁门，或从邻近居民住宅中挖墙冲进。港英军警蓄意向中国人民和香港爱国同胞挑衅，他们进入工会会所后，除大肆搜查和捣毁内部物件外，还撕毁会所内的全部毛主席像和毛主席语录。他们卑鄙地劫走工会的文件、金钱和一部分物品，连工人学习用的《毛主席语录》也全部被劫走。此外，在袭击工人俱乐部时，附近大厦的几个爱国机构和一些居民的住宅，也被港英军警冲入捣毁。据港英“新闻处”发表的统计，港英法西斯当局在十六日进行的武装袭击中，共逮捕了工人和附近居民六百三十四人。
    港英法西斯当局对爱国工会的大镇压和大搜捕，引起港九爱国同胞的极大愤怒，成千上万的群众涌到三个被港英武力袭击的现场附近街道，横目怒对港英法西斯匪徒，高呼“打倒英帝国主义！”“打倒走狗！”许多人向英国军警投掷石块、玻璃瓶，有的人还用鱼炮向这些法西斯匪徒进行反击。在港九其他区域里，也有许多人涌上街头，痛击港英警察，对港英制造新的法西斯暴行表示强烈抗议。特别在香港湾仔区，当天下午四时许就有几百名爱国同胞聚集街头，痛击港英“防暴队”，尽管港英警察发射了无数催泪弹、木枪弹、铁沙枪和卡宾枪弹，勇敢的爱国同胞一直同残暴的敌人坚持搏斗到深夜。在九龙土瓜湾区工人俱乐部附近，爱国同胞整夜向英国军警投掷石块、玻璃瓶，大挫敌人凶焰。港英法西斯当局无可奈何地不得不在十六日深夜宣布，把工人俱乐部附近地区列为“禁区”，出动大批军警驻守。
    港英法西斯当局这次对香港爱国同胞的大镇压和大搜捕是从十一日开始的。从十一日到十六日，港英武装军警共袭击了我十三个爱国机构，逮捕爱国机构人员及附近居民达八百多人。死伤数字目前还无法统计。此外，港英还悍然绑架新华社香港分社记者三人，爱国报纸记者五人和爱国电影演员二人。
    敌人的大镇压和大搜捕，激起了香港爱国同胞的极大愤怒。早已燃烧起来的抗暴烈火现在烧得更旺，大大促进了反英抗暴新高潮的到来。
