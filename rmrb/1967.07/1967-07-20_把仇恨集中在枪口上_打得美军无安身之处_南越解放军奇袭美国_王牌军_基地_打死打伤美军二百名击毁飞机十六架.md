Preliminary reports indicate that the attack resulted in the deaths and injuries of 200 U.S. aggressor troops, the destruction of 16 aircraft of various types, 10 armored vehicles, and the burning of four fuel and ammunition depots and multiple barracks.

Under the cover of artillery fire, the assault troops quickly rushed into the airfield, artillery positions, parking lot, and the U.S. military barracks, causing heavy casualties and leaving the enemy unable to resist.

Simultaneously, another unit of the liberation armed forces attacked the new stronghold eight kilometers east of Han Tam, which was defended by the 2nd Battalion of the 9th Regiment of the puppet forces. After a six-minute battle, the liberation armed forces annihilated two enemy companies, killing and wounding over 200 puppet soldiers, and seized a large amount of ammunition and military supplies.
