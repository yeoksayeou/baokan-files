The People of Tirana Warmly Welcome Chairman Mao's Red Guards
The People of China and Albania Will Forever Fight Side by Side to Eliminate All Harmful Elements

	According to Xinhua News Agency, Tirana, July 2nd: A delegation of Chinese Red Guards, led by Comrade Yao Wenyuan, after being invited to participate in the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Labor Youth League, continued their friendly visit in Tirana and received a very warm and friendly welcome from the people of Tirana.

	The delegation visited the "Tirana" factory and the "Migjani" handicraft cooperative in the morning.

	The "Tirana" factory is a new plant built this year by the heroic Albanian working class, relying on self-reliance and high revolutionary spirit. All products previously had to be imported. After the factory was built, it received great attention and care from the Party and the state. So far, this factory, which has been in operation for only half a year, has developed into a comprehensive utilization plant producing hundreds of products.

	The factory director, Spiro Petro, accompanied the Chinese Red Guards delegation to tour all the workshops and gave a detailed introduction to the delegation about the creative work done by the workers in implementing the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Party. Wherever the Chinese Red Guards delegation went, shouts of "Enver-Hoxha! Mao Zedong!" "People's China!" "Friendship is guaranteed!" echoed.

	Comrade Yao Wenyuan, the head of the delegation, highly praised the revolutionary spirit of the Albanian working class during the visit. He said, "We are very happy to visit your factory on the 46th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China. Your factory adheres to the principle of self-reliance, carries forward the revolutionary spirit taught by Comrade Hoxha of holding a pickaxe in one hand and a gun in the other, and has achieved great success."

	After the visit, the factory director presented a desk lamp produced by the factory to the Chinese Red Guards delegation.

	Comrade Yao Wenyuan, while accepting the gift, excitedly said, "You have given us a very meaningful gift. Heroic Albania is a beacon of socialism in Europe." Comrade Yao Wenyuan also, on behalf of the Chinese Red Guards delegation, presented a portrait of Chairman Mao to the factory. At this moment, the entire workforce enthusiastically shouted, "Enver-Hoxha! Mao Zedong!" "Long live the Red Guards!"

	When the Chinese Red Guards delegation arrived at the "Migjani" handicraft cooperative, the workers who had been waiting at the cooperative's gate shouted, "Enver-Hoxha! Mao Zedong!" "People's China!" "Friendship is guaranteed!" Many young people rushed to the members of the Red Guards delegation, shook hands with them, and hugged them tightly.

	The secretary of the Labor Youth League of the handicraft cooperative, Armiada Rach, on behalf of all the workers, delivered a welcome speech to the Chinese Red Guards delegation. She said, "Today, we are very happy to be with the Chinese Red Guards. This excitement is indescribable. You are the vanguard of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, an army that breaks the old and establishes the new. The brilliant victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution once again proves that the Communist Party of China is a glorious, great, and correct party, and China is a great country of proletarian dictatorship. Please allow me, on behalf of all the young people of the handicraft cooperative, to pay our highest revolutionary respects to you, and please convey our warmest revolutionary respects to the Chinese Red Guards and to our most beloved friend, Chairman Mao Zedong! Long live the great leaders of the people of China and Albania, Chairman Mao Zedong and Comrade Enver Hoxha! Long live the Red Guards!"

	Comrade Yao Wenyuan also spoke.

	After the speech, the delegation, accompanied by the responsible person of the "Migjani" handicraft cooperative, Fad Dushko, visited various workshops and various handicraft products of the cooperative. The delegation enthusiastically praised the handicraft products with national style and tradition produced by the cooperative.

	Comrade Yao Wenyuan told the workers gathered in the workshop, "We have seen your meaningful labor, seen the image of heroic, diligent, and brave Albanian people. The eagle with its wings spread wide symbolizes the brave spirit of the Albanian people, symbolizes the revolutionary spirit of the Albanian people daring to fight and daring to win. We should be like the eagle, breaking through all the sabotage of imperialism and revisionism, soaring to the heights of communism; we should be like the eagle, fearlessly charging at imperialism and modern revisionism, defeating them, and then stepping on them with one foot, making them never able to rise again."

	Comrade Yao Wenyuan also said, "At a time when Western bourgeoisie and Soviet revisionism are using decadent and reactionary culture to corrupt us, vigorously developing proletarian culture with national characteristics is a powerful weapon to resist the reactionary culture of imperialism and revisionism."

	Comrade Yao Wenyuan's speech greatly inspired all the workers of the cooperative. They shouted enthusiastically again and again, "Enver-Hoxha! Mao Zedong!" "People's China!" "Friendship is guaranteed!"

	When Comrade Yao Wenyuan, on behalf of the Red Guards delegation, presented the embroidered portraits of Chairman Mao and Comrade Hoxha and the golden statue of Chairman Mao produced by Chinese handicraft workers during the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the handicraft cooperative, the entire venue once again resonated with enthusiastic cheers: "Enver-Hoxha! Mao Zedong!" "Friendship is guaranteed!" "Long live Chairman Mao!"

	The Chinese Red Guards delegation visited the "Komza" state farm in the morning of July 2nd. The workers of the state farm welcomed the Red Guards sent by Chairman Mao in the rain, lining the streets, and held a grand welcoming ceremony. The director of the state farm, Temlush Taci, said in his speech at the welcoming ceremony, "The visit of the Chinese Red Guards delegation to our farm is a major event that we will never forget, because you are the representatives of 700 million Chinese people, the representatives of the great Communist Party of China, and the representatives of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. 'Imperialism and revisionism are terrified of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China, and they are doing everything they can to attack and besiege China. But the plots of imperialism and revisionism will never succeed.'"

	Comrade Yao Wenyuan, in his speech, highly praised the revolutionary spirit of the Albanian people and introduced the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. He said, "The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country has achieved great victories, which is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, a victory of the proletariat and revolutionary people. The Chinese Red Guards are determined, under the leadership of our supreme commander, the red sun in our hearts, Chairman Mao, to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end, making the socialist iron mountain unshakable."

	Comrade Yao Wenyuan also said, "The friendship between the two parties, two countries, and the youth of China and Albania is created by Comrade Mao Zedong and Comrade Hoxha, tested in the stormy struggle against imperialism and revisionism, and no force in the world can destroy this friendship. Our hearts are forever united, our revolutionary hands are forever joined, and in the future, we will forever fight side by side to eliminate all the harmful elements in the world."

	The speeches of Director Taci and Comrade Yao Wenyuan were repeatedly interrupted by shouts of "Enver-Hoxha! Mao Zedong!" "Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Red Guards!" Many young pioneers wearing red scarves also gathered outside the venue, enthusiastically waving to the Chinese Red Guards, clapping their hands in rhythm, and shouting "Enver-Hoxha! Mao Zedong!" over and over again.

	Accompanying the Chinese Red Guards delegation on the visit were Haxhi Leshi, secretary of the Central Committee of the Albanian Labor Youth League, and Chinese Ambassador to Albania Liu Xiao, among others. (With photos)

　　地拉那人民热情欢迎毛主席的红小兵
　　中阿人民永远并肩战斗消灭一切害人虫
    据新华社地拉那二日电　由姚文元同志率领的中国红卫兵代表团，在应邀参加了阿尔巴尼亚劳动青年联盟第五次代表大会以后，继续在地拉那进行友好访问，受到地拉那人民十分热情和友好的欢迎。
    代表团在一日上午参观了“地拉那”工厂和“米吉安尼”手工业合作社。
    “地拉那”工厂是英雄的阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级发扬高度的革命精神，依靠自力更生在今年建成的一座新厂。这个厂生产的全部产品在过去都要依靠进口。工厂建成后，受到党和国家的极大关怀和重视。到目前为止，这座刚刚建成半年的工厂，已经发展成为能够生产几百种产品的综合利用的工厂。
    这个厂的厂长斯皮罗·佩特罗陪同中国红卫兵代表团参观了工厂的所有车间，并向代表团详细介绍了工人们在贯彻劳动党五大决议方面所进行的创造性劳动。中国红卫兵代表团走到那里，那里就响起“恩维尔—毛泽东！”“人民中国！”“友谊是保证！”的欢呼声。
    姚文元团长在参观时，高度赞扬阿尔巴尼亚工人阶级的革命精神。他说：“我们中国红卫兵代表团在中国共产党成立四十六周年的时候来到你们工厂参观，使我们感到非常高兴。你们工厂坚持自力更生的方针，发扬霍查同志所一贯教导的一手拿镐、一手拿枪的革命精神，取得了巨大的成就。”
    参观结束后，工厂厂长把这个厂生产的一盏台灯赠送给中国红卫兵代表团。
    姚文元同志在接受这一礼物时兴奋地说：“你们送给我们中国红卫兵代表团一件很有意义的礼物。英雄的阿尔巴尼亚就是欧洲的一盏社会主义的明灯。”姚文元同志还代表中国红卫兵代表团把毛主席绣像赠送给这家工厂。这时全场职工热烈高呼：“恩维尔—毛泽东！”“红卫兵万岁！”
    当中国红卫兵代表团来到“米吉安尼”手工业合作社时，早就等候在合作社门前的职工们不断高呼：“恩维尔—毛泽东！”“人民中国！”“友谊是保证！”许多青年纷纷跑到红卫兵代表团成员身边，同他们热情握手，紧紧拥抱。
    这个手工业合作社的劳动青年联盟书记阿尔米达·拉契代表全体职工，向中国红卫兵代表团致欢迎词。她说，“今天我们能和中国红卫兵在一起感到十分高兴，这种兴奋心情是难以形容的。你们是中国无产阶级文化大革命的急先锋，是一支破旧立新的大军。无产阶级文化大革命的光辉胜利再一次证明，中国共产党是光荣、伟大和正确的党，中国是无产阶级专政的伟大国家。请允许我代表手工业合作社的全体青年向你们致以崇高的革命敬礼，并请你们向中国红卫兵，向我国人民最敬爱的朋友毛泽东主席转达我们最热烈的革命敬礼！中阿两国人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席和恩维尔·霍查同志万岁！红卫兵万岁！”
    姚文元团长也讲了话。
    讲话以后，代表团在“米吉安尼”手工业合作社负责人弗阿德·杜什科陪同下，参观了合作社的各个车间和各种手工艺产品。代表团热烈赞扬合作社生产的具有民族风格和传统的手工艺产品。
    姚文元同志向聚集在车间里的职工说：“我们看到了你们富有意义的劳动，看到了英雄、勤劳、勇敢的阿尔巴尼亚人民的形象。那张开双翅飞翔的山鹰，象征着阿尔巴尼亚人民的勇敢精神，象征着阿尔巴尼亚人民敢于斗争、敢于胜利的革命精神。我们就要象山鹰那样冲破帝国主义和修正主义的一切破坏，冲向共产主义的高空；就要象山鹰那样无畏地冲向帝国主义和现代修正主义，把他们打倒，再踏上一只脚，让他们永世不得翻身。”
    姚文元同志还说，“在西方资产阶级和苏联修正主义千方百计地用腐朽没落的反动文化腐蚀我们的时候，大力发展无产阶级的具有民族特点的革命文化，是抵制帝国主义和修正主义反动文化的有力武器。”
    姚文元同志的讲话给合作社全体职工以极大鼓舞，他们一遍又一遍地热烈高呼：“恩维尔—毛泽东！”“人民中国！”“友谊是保证！”
    当姚文元同志代表红卫兵代表团把中国手工艺工人在无产阶级文化大革命中生产的新产品——毛主席和霍查同志的织锦像和金光闪闪的毛主席塑像赠送给手工业合作社时，全场再次响起热烈的欢呼：“恩维尔—毛泽东！”“友谊是保证！”“毛主席万岁！”
    中国红卫兵代表团二日上午参观了“科姆扎”国营农场。农场职工冒雨夹道热烈欢迎毛主席派来的红卫兵战士，并举行了隆重的欢迎大会。国营农场场长特姆卢什·塔齐在欢迎会上讲话说：“中国红卫兵代表团访问我们农场，这是我们永远不能忘记的重大事件，因为你们是七亿中国人民的代表，是伟大的中国共产党的代表，是中国无产阶级文化大革命的代表。”“帝国主义和修正主义对中国无产阶级文化大革命怕得要死，他们千方百计地攻击和包围中国。但是帝国主义和修正主义的阴谋，永远也不会得逞。”
    姚文元团长在讲话中高度赞扬了阿尔巴尼亚人民的革命精神，并介绍了中国无产阶级文化大革命。他说，“史无前例的我国无产阶级文化大革命已经取得了伟大的胜利，这是毛泽东思想的伟大胜利，是无产阶级和革命人民的胜利。中国红卫兵决心在我们的最高统帅、我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席的领导下，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底，使社会主义铁打江山永不变色。”
    姚文元还说：“中阿两党、两国人民和青年之间的友谊是由毛泽东同志和霍查同志缔造起来的，是在反对帝国主义和修正主义的斗争中经历过急风暴雨考验的，世界上没有任何力量能够破坏这种友谊。我们的心永远连在一起，我们革命的手永远握在一起，今后我们将永远并肩战斗，把世界上的一切害人虫统统消灭干净。”
    塔齐场长和姚文元团长的讲话不断为“恩维尔—毛泽东！”“无产阶级文化大革命万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“红卫兵万岁！”的欢呼声所打断。许多系着红领巾的少年儿童也围在会场外面热情地向中国红卫兵挥手致意，并且有节奏地拍着手，一遍又一遍地高呼“恩维尔—毛泽东！”
