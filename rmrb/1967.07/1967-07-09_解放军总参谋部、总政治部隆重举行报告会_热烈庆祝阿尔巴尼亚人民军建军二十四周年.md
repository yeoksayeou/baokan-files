The General Staff Department and the General Political Department of the People's Liberation Army held a grand meeting this afternoon to celebrate the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian People's Army.

A Xinhua News Agency report from July 8th: The Chinese People's Liberation Army General Staff Department and the General Political Department today held a grand meeting to celebrate the 24th anniversary of the founding of the Albanian People's Army.

Albanian Ambassador to China, Nataneli, was invited to attend the meeting. The military attaché of the Albanian Embassy, Hatu, gave a passionate and lengthy speech at the meeting.

The meeting was presided over by Vice Director of the General Political Department, Yuan Ziqin. He, on behalf of all the officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, extended high and warm fraternal greetings to the glorious and great comrades of the Albanian People's Army. Yuan Ziqin praised the Albanian People's Army as a heroic army with a glorious revolutionary tradition, nurtured under the leadership of the beloved leader of the Albanian people and the close friend of the Chinese people, Comrade Enver Hoxha. This heroic army, under the leadership of the great Albanian Party of Labor, closely united with the people of the entire country, has held high the banner of Marxism-Leninism. In the struggle against American imperialism, modern revisionism led by the Soviet leadership, and all kinds of reactionaries, and in the socialist revolution and socialist construction, it has established immortal merits.

He said, the Albanian People's Army has resolutely implemented the resolutions of the Fifth Congress of the Albanian Party of Labor and the wise measures proposed by Comrade Enver Hoxha to further strengthen the revolutionary nature of the troops. The broad masses of cadres and soldiers are full of vigor and fighting spirit, advancing along the path of becoming more revolutionary and more combat-ready, achieving one great victory after another. We are proud to have such a close comrade-in-arms, the heroic Albanian People's Army! The fraternal Albanian people, with the spirit of self-reliance and hard work, and the proletarian revolutionary heroism of overcoming all enemies, are waging a heroic socialist struggle on all fronts and have already achieved great success. Our great leader Chairman Mao said: "Heroic Albania, a great beacon of socialism in Europe."

Yuan Ziqin, when talking about the friendship between the peoples and armies of China and Albania, said, our great leader Chairman Mao said: "'Though we are separated by thousands of mountains and rivers, our hearts are united.' Although China and Albania are far apart, our hearts are connected. 'No matter what happens in the world, our two parties and peoples will definitely unite, fight together, and win together.' The revolutionary friendship established in the struggle against our common enemies, American imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, and all reactionaries, is a proletarian internationalist friendship, the greatest friendship in the world. We are deeply convinced that the friendship between our two peoples and armies will be passed down for generations, and its great glory will shine forever across the world!

Comrade Hatu spoke amidst warm applause. After introducing the glorious history and construction achievements of the heroic Albanian People's Army, he said, the Albanian People's Army and people, together with the heroic Chinese People's Liberation Army and the great and brave Chinese people, stand shoulder to shoulder on the front lines of anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, ready to strike a fatal blow to all enemies at any time. He pointed out that the Albanian Party of Labor and Comrade Hoxha have always attached great importance to educating our army with the sublime thoughts of Marxism-Leninism. All the conspiracies and tricks of the enemy have met with shameful failure and will be utterly defeated!

Comrade Hatu strongly condemned the heinous crimes committed by American imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism in Vietnam, saying, the attitude towards the just war of the heroic Vietnamese people against American aggressors has become a fundamental issue today. On this issue, it is clear who is a friend and who is an enemy of the Vietnamese people, who is revolutionary and who is counter-revolutionary, and who is a public and hidden enemy disguised as a 'friend' and stabbing the people in the back. The fraternal Chinese people and the glorious army stand firmly behind the Vietnamese people. The Albanian people, government, and army have sincere feelings for the Vietnamese people and firmly support their just struggle until they achieve complete victory. He said, between our two parties and peoples, a sincere and unbreakable friendship has been established. The Albanian people and their army are delighted by the brilliant achievements of the brilliant Chinese people in all aspects, especially in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, which marks the victory of Mao Zedong's Marxism-Leninism. This Cultural Revolution not only has historical significance for the destiny of Chinese socialism but also for the destiny of the world socialist revolution. We wish the Chinese people, army, and Red Guards greater achievements and hope that China will achieve complete victory in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution on the path indicated by the outstanding Marxist-Leninist Chairman Mao Zedong.

Vice Chief of the General Staff of the People's Liberation Army, Wang Xinting, as well as leaders from the General Logistics Department, various military branches, and the Beijing Military Region, and representatives of over 800 officers and soldiers from the army, navy, and air force, attended the meeting. After the meeting, films such as "People of the World Love Chairman Mao" and "Chairman Mao Strongly Supports the Revolutionary Rebels" were screened.

　　解放军总参谋部、总政治部隆重举行报告会
　　热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民军建军二十四周年
    新华社八日讯　中国人民解放军总参谋部、总政治部今天下午隆重举行报告会，热烈庆祝阿尔巴尼亚人民军建军二十四周年。
    阿尔巴尼亚驻中国大使纳塔奈利应邀出席了报告会，大使馆武官哈图在会上作了热情洋溢的长篇报告。
    报告会由总政治部副主任袁子钦主持。他代表中国人民解放军全体指战员，向光荣的、伟大的阿尔巴尼亚人民军战友，致以崇高的、热烈的、兄弟般的节日祝贺。袁子钦赞扬阿尔巴尼亚人民军是在阿尔巴尼亚人民敬爱的伟大领袖、中国人民亲密的朋友恩维尔·霍查同志培育下的一支有着光荣革命斗争传统的英雄军队。这支英雄军队在伟大的阿尔巴尼亚劳动党领导下，紧紧地和全国人民一起，高举马克思列宁主义的旗帜，在同美帝国主义、以苏联领导集团为首的现代修正主义和一切形形色色的反动派的斗争中，在社会主义革命和社会主义建设中，建立了不朽的功勋。
    他说，阿尔巴尼亚人民军坚决贯彻了阿尔巴尼亚劳动党第五次代表大会决议和恩维尔·霍查同志提出的关于进一步加强部队革命化的一系列英明措施，广大干部、战士意气风发，斗志昂扬，正在沿着更加革命化、更加战斗化的道路飞跃前进，取得了一个又一个的伟大胜利。我们为有英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民军这样亲密的战友感到自豪！兄弟的阿尔巴尼亚人民，以自力更生、艰苦奋斗的精神和压倒一切敌人的无产阶级革命英雄主义气概，在各条战线上全面展开英勇的社会主义的大奋战，并已取得了巨大的成就。我们的伟大领袖毛主席说：“英雄的人民的阿尔巴尼亚，成为欧洲的一盏伟大的社会主义的明灯。”
    袁子钦在谈到中阿两国人民和军队的友谊时说，我们伟大领袖毛主席说：“‘海内存知己，天涯若比邻’。中阿两国远隔千山万水，我们的心是连在一起的。”“不管世界上发生什么事情，我们两党、两国人民，一定团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。”在反对我们共同的敌人美帝国主义、苏联现代修正主义和一切反动派的斗争中建立起来的革命友谊，是无产阶级国际主义的友谊，是世界上最伟大的友谊。我们深信，我们两国人民和军队之间的友谊，必将传之千秋万代，它的伟大光辉必将永照全世界！
    哈图同志在热烈的掌声中讲话。他在介绍了英雄的阿尔巴尼亚人民军的光荣历史和建设成就以后说，阿尔巴尼亚人民军和人民与英雄的中国人民解放军和伟大而勇敢的中国人民并肩站在反帝反修的最前线，随时准备给予一切敌人以致命的打击。他指出，阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和霍查同志历来都特别重视用马克思列宁主义的崇高思想教育我们的军队，敌人所进行的阴谋诡计，都遭到了可耻的失败，还必将失败到底！
    哈图同志强烈谴责美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义在越南犯下的滔天罪行后说，对英雄的越南人民反对美国侵略者的正义战争持什么态度，今天已经成为一个根本的原则问题。在这个问题上，看出了谁是越南人民的朋友和敌人，谁是革命的和反革命的，谁是披着“朋友”的外衣而在背后给人民一刀的公开和隐蔽的敌人。兄弟的中国人民和光荣的军队作为越南人民的坚强后盾，阿尔巴尼亚人民、政府和人民军对越南人民怀有真挚的情谊，坚决支持他们的正义斗争，直到取得彻底胜利。他说，在我们两党和两国人民之间，建立了真诚的、牢不可破的友谊。阿尔巴尼亚人民及其军队，为天才的中国人民在各方面，特别是在无产阶级文化大革命中取得了标志着毛泽东同志的马克思列宁主义思想胜利的光辉成就而感到欢欣鼓舞。这场文化大革命，不仅对中国的社会主义命运，而且对全世界社会主义革命的命运都具有历史性的意义。我们祝愿中国人民、军队和红卫兵小将取得更伟大的成就，希望中国在无产阶级文化大革命中，在杰出的马克思列宁主义者毛泽东主席指出的道路上取得彻底的胜利。
    人民解放军副总参谋长王新亭以及总后勤部、各军种、兵种、北京部队领导机关的负责人和陆海空军指战员代表八百多人，参加了报告会。会后，放映了《全世界人民热爱毛主席》、《毛主席最最支持革命造反派》等纪录影片。
