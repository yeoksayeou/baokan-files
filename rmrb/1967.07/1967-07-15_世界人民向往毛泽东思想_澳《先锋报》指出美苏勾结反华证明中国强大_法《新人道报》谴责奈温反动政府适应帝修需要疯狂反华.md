The World's People Yearn for Mao Zedong Thought

	The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) organ, the *Vanguard*, published an editorial on July 13 condemning the collusion between U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism in stirring up an anti-China tide worldwide.

	The editorial states: U.S. imperialism is desperately trying to stir up a tide against China and against the great leader of the world's people, Chairman Mao Zedong. The U.S. is everywhere attempting to isolate China, and the Soviet revisionist leadership is doing the same.

	The editorial says: In Indonesia, U.S. imperialism is inciting violent anti-China activities. The same is true in India. In Burma, it is currently collaborating with local reactionaries to do the same.

	The editorial points out that all this fully proves the strength of China, fully proves the great influence of Mao Zedong Thought on the oppressed peoples of the world; at the same time, it also shows the weakness of U.S. imperialism, Soviet revisionism, and their followers.

	The editorial emphasizes: The world's people yearn for Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought is the guarantee of liberation and victory for socialism. No one can isolate Mao Zedong Thought and Mao Zedong's China, because they are the truth of our times, and truth is indestructible.

	The editorial concludes by stating that the counter-revolutionary tide currently being stirred up in some parts of the world actually proves the victory of Mao Zedong Thought and the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China. It proves that the revolutionary people of India, Indonesia, Burma, and other countries are approaching victory.

	The French Communist Movement (Marxist-Leninist) organ, *New Humanity*, published on July 13 a strong condemnation of the Burmese reactionary government's adaptation to the needs of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, and its frenzied creation of fascist atrocities against China.

	*New Humanity* stresses that the attacks on Burmese Chinese, the mass slaughter of Chinese residents, and the plundering of their homes and property are all planned by the Burmese Ne Win reactionary government.

	The paper condemns the Burmese reactionary government for unreasonably rejecting the Chinese government's demand for a list of the injured Chinese residents and for the return of the severely injured Chinese residents to China for treatment. The paper points out that the Burmese reactionary government, in order to cover up its crimes, has even destroyed the bodies of the murdered Chinese residents.

	The paper emphasizes: "However, the Ne Win reactionary government commits such crimes precisely because it is in a predicament, because it fears the Burmese people, fears the Chinese people, and fears Mao Zedong Thought."

	The paper concludes by stating that the Chinese people and the Burmese people will make the Burmese reactionary government pay for its blood debt. The armed struggle currently being waged by the Burmese people will overthrow this government.

	*New Humanity* on the same day published on the front page a large photograph of Beijing people demonstrating against the anti-China atrocities of the Burmese reactionary government. It also published excerpts from the speech given by Thakin Ba Tin, First Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party, on July 5 in Beijing.

    世界人民向往毛泽东思想
    澳《先锋报》指出美苏勾结反华证明中国强大
    法《新人道报》谴责奈温反动政府适应帝修需要疯狂反华
    新华社墨尔本十三日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）机关报《先锋报》十三日发表社论，谴责美帝苏修互相勾结，在世界上掀起一股反华逆流。
    社论说：美帝国主义正在拚命企图掀起反对中国和反对世界人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席的逆流。美帝到处在设法孤立中国，苏联修正主义领导集团也在这样做。
    社论说：在印度尼西亚，美帝国主义煽动狂暴的反华活动。在印度也是一样。在缅甸，它目前正在配合当地反动派这样做。
    社论指出，这一切充分证明了中国的强大，充分证明了毛泽东思想对全世界被压迫人民的巨大影响；同时也表明了美帝国主义、苏联修正主义及其追随者的虚弱。
    社论强调指出：世界人民向往毛泽东思想。毛泽东思想是取得解放和社会主义胜利的保证。谁也孤立不了毛泽东思想和毛泽东的中国，因为她们是当代的真理，而真理是不灭的。
    社论最后指出，目前在世界上一些地区所掀起的反革命逆流，恰恰证明了毛泽东思想和中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，证明了印度、印度尼西亚、缅甸和其他国家的革命人民正在接近胜利。
    新华社巴黎十四日电　法国共产主义运动（马克思列宁主义）机关刊《新人道报》七月十三日出版的一期，强烈谴责缅甸反动政府适应美帝、苏修的需要，疯狂地制造反华排华的法西斯暴行。
    《新人道报》强调指出，对缅甸华侨的袭击，对中国侨民的大肆屠杀，以及对他们的家庭和对他们的财产的掠夺，都是由缅甸奈温反动政府所策划的。
    报纸谴责缅甸反动政府无理拒绝中国政府责成它提供受害华侨的名单和接回被毒打重伤的华侨回国治疗的正义要求。报纸指出，缅甸反动政府为了掩盖它的罪行，竟然销毁了被害华侨的尸体。
    报纸强调说：“然而，奈温反动政府犯下这样的罪行，正是因为它处于困境，因为它害怕缅甸人民、害怕中国人民和害怕毛泽东思想。”
    报纸最后指出，中国人民和缅甸人民必将要缅甸反动政府偿还血债，缅甸人民目前正在胜利进行的武装斗争将推翻这个政府。
    《新人道报》同一天在第一版刊登了北京人民示威游行反对缅甸反动政府的反华排华暴行的大幅照片。另外还刊登了缅甸共产党中央委员会第一副主席德钦巴登顶同志七月五日在北京的讲话摘要。
