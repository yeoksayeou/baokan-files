South Vietnamese armed forces fight ferociously in the rainy season
The U.S. Marine Corps is severely beaten in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region; an entire company of U.S. paratroopers is annihilated in the Central Highlands

	NEW DELHI, July 2 (Xinhua) — The liberation armed forces in South Vietnam's Quang Tri-Thua Thien region have been continuously launching attacks during the rainy season, inflicting heavy casualties on the U.S. aggressor forces.

	On June 27, the liberation armed forces launched a heavy artillery barrage on the positions of the U.S. Marine Corps' 26th Regiment south of the demilitarized zone. Reports indicate that over 130 enemy troops were killed or wounded. The next day, the liberation armed forces surrounded a puppet military patrol unit near this position. The regiment hastily dispatched a company of U.S. troops to rescue them, but before they reached their destination, they fell into an ambush by the liberation armed forces and suffered heavy casualties.

	In Phu Vang County, Quang Tri-Thua Thien region, local forces and guerrillas thwarted the enemy's "sweeping" operations in the northeastern part of the county from June 7 to 11, eliminating 95 U.S. and puppet troops. In Phu Tho County, local forces and guerrillas also thwarted the enemy's "sweeping" operations in an area 24 kilometers northwest of Hue City from June 17 to 21, eliminating 72 U.S. aggressor troops. The guerrillas in Phu Vang and Thua Thien counties have been continuously attacking enemy troops, eliminating over 150 U.S. and puppet troops from June 3 to 16.

	The Liberation Army's organ, the "Liberation Army Newspaper," recently published a commentary stating that the people and military in Quang Tri-Thua Thien have adhered to the line of people's war, with revolutionary-awakened people as the main force and political ideology as the foundation, thus overcoming all the enemy's modern weapons. The liberation armed forces in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region attach great importance to political education, strengthen ideological work, and raise the revolutionary consciousness and revolutionary heroism of every soldier and cadre.

	The commentary said that the main forces, local forces, and guerrillas in the Quang Tri-Thua Thien region have closely cooperated, continuously fought, and continuously attacked the enemy, flexibly and creatively using various tactics, thus continuously achieving victories.

	NEW DELHI, July 1 (Xinhua) — According to a report from the South Vietnamese Liberation News Agency, the liberation armed forces in South Vietnam's Tuy Hoa Province launched a fierce artillery attack on the U.S. military base in Oit on the night of June 24. Preliminary reports indicate that 40 aircraft were destroyed or damaged, and hundreds of U.S. aggressor troops were killed.

	The report said that the airfield and artillery positions within the base were paralyzed, six bunkers and many buildings were destroyed, and an ammunition warehouse was hit and exploded. According to a supplementary report from the Liberation News Agency, the liberation armed forces in Gia Lai Province killed or wounded nearly 600 U.S. aggressor troops and 70 puppet "pacification" personnel in an attack on the U.S. 4th Infantry Division base in Pleiku on June 10, destroying 210 military vehicles and many warehouses and enemy barracks.

	According to Xinhua News Agency, SAIGON — On June 22, the liberation armed forces in South Vietnam's Central Highlands annihilated an entire company of U.S. paratroopers, dealing a heavy blow to the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade, which had just been transferred from the southern battlefield.

	Since the rainy season began, the liberation armed forces in the Central Highlands have launched a powerful offensive against the U.S. aggressor forces. To reinforce the U.S. 4th Infantry Division, which had suffered consecutive defeats, the U.S. military command in Vietnam hastily transferred the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade, which had been guarding the Saigon stronghold, in late May. This so-called "elite" U.S. paratrooper unit, which had just arrived in the Central Highlands, was immediately met with fierce resistance from the local military and people. According to Western news agencies, two companies of the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade were "searching" near the U.S. Special Forces camp in Da Do, Kontum Province, on June 22. As soon as they moved out, they were surrounded by the liberation armed forces in the jungle. The liberation armed forces fiercely attacked them with small arms and grenades. After an eight-hour battle, the U.S. troops had 167 killed, wounded, and missing.

　　南越人民武装雨季打得猛
　　广治—承天地区狠揍美国海军陆战队　中部高原全歼一连美国空降兵
    新华社河内二日电  越南南方广治—承天地区的解放武装力量在雨季中不断出击，给予美国侵略军以重大的杀伤。
    解放武装力量在六月二十七日以密集的炮火轰击了非军事区以南美国海军陆战队第二十六团的阵地。据报道，有一百三十多名敌人被打死打伤。第二天，解放武装力量又在这个阵地附近包围了一支伪军巡逻队，这个团急忙派出一个连的美军前去救援，但还没赶到目的地，就落进解放武装力量的伏击圈，被打死打伤了很多人。
    广治—承天地区富汪县的地方部队和游击队在六月七日到十一日粉碎了敌人在这个县东北部地区进行的“扫荡”，消灭美伪军九十五名。丰田县的地方部队和游击队在六月十七日到二十一日也粉碎了敌人在顺化市西北二十四公里的地方进行的一次“扫荡”，消灭美国侵略军七十二名。富汪县和香水县游击队不断袭击敌军，在六月三日到十六日共消灭美伪军一百五十多名。
    越南南方解放武装力量机关报《解放军报》最近发表评论指出，广治—承天军民贯彻了人民战争的路线，以有革命觉悟的人的因素为主，以政治思想为根本，从而战胜了敌人的一切现代化武器。广治—承天地区解放武装力量非常重视政治教育，加强思想工作，提高每一个战士和干部的革命觉悟和革命英雄主义精神。
    评论说，广治—承天地区的主力部队、地方部队和游击队紧密配合，连续战斗，连续进攻敌人，并灵活和创造性地运用多种战术，因而不断取得胜利。
    新华社河内一日电据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方土龙木省解放武装力量六月二十四日夜晚用猛烈的炮火袭击油汀美军基地，据初步消息，击毁击伤飞机四十架，打死美国侵略军成百名。
    报道说，这个基地内的机场和炮兵阵地被打得陷于瘫痪，六座碉堡和许多房屋被击毁，一个装满炮弹的仓库被击中爆炸。另据解放通讯社补充报道，嘉莱省解放武装力量六月十日在进攻波来古市美国第四步兵师基地的战斗中，共打死打伤美国侵略军近六百名和伪“绥靖”人员七十名，击毁军车二百一十辆，摧毁许多仓库和敌军宿舍。
    据新华社讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量二十二日在中部高原全歼一连美国伞兵，沉重打击了刚从南部战场调去的美军第一七三空降旅。
    进入雨季以来，中部高原的解放武装力量对美国侵略军发动了强大攻势。侵越美军当局为了增援连吃败仗的美军第四步兵师，五月底匆忙把看守西贡老巢的美军第一七三空降旅调去。这支号称“精锐”的美国伞兵部队在中部高原立足未定，就接连遭到了当地军民的迎头痛击。据西方通讯社报道，美军第一七三空降旅的两个连，二十二日在昆嵩省美军特种部队营地达多附近“搜索”，一出动就在丛林中遭到解放武装力量的“全面包围”，解放武装力量用小型武器和手榴弹狠揍他们，经过八小时激战，美军被打死、打伤和“失踪”的共一百六十七名。
