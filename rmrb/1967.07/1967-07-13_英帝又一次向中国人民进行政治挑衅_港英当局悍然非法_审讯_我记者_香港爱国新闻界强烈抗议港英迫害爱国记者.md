The British Empire once again politically provokes the Chinese people. The Hong Kong British authorities brazenly conducted an illegal "trial" of our journalist. The patriotic news circles in Hong Kong strongly protest the British oppression of patriotic journalists.

	The Hong Kong branch of Xinhua News Agency reported on July 12 that the insane Hong Kong British fascist authorities today morning in the "Central Magistracy" brazenly conducted an illegal "trial" of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch journalist Xue Ping. Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch staff immediately protested on the spot in the "courtroom" and once again lodged the strongest protest.

	When the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch staff learned of the news that the Hong Kong British authorities were illegally "trialing" a Xinhua journalist, they were all indignant and immediately sent eight representatives to the "Central Magistracy" to protest. Upon arrival, the eight representatives were unreasonably refused entry by the Hong Kong British authorities. After a struggle, only the Xinhua journalists with "press cards" were allowed to enter to listen.

	In the "courtroom," the Hong Kong British police, under the pretext of "illegal assembly" and "participating in a threatening assembly," falsely accused Xinhua journalist Xue Ping. The "judge" dared to decide to "transfer him to the local court for trial," attempting to carry out further persecution. At this time, the Xinhua journalists who had entered the "courtroom" immediately loudly protested the persecution by the Hong Kong British fascist authorities and pointed out that the Chinese Foreign Ministry had already lodged the strongest protest to the British government over this matter, demanding that the Hong Kong British authorities immediately release the person, otherwise all serious consequences would be borne by the Hong Kong British authorities. This resolute action frightened the "judge" into a state of panic, hastily leaving the bench, and ordering the Hong Kong British police to use force to drag the journalist out of the "courtroom," and also making shameless threats.

	The persecuted Xinhua journalist Xue Ping, defying the Hong Kong British "judge," firmly stated three protests on the spot: protesting the illegal arrest of journalists by the Hong Kong British authorities; protesting the illegal beating of journalists by the Hong Kong British authorities; protesting the trampling of press freedom by the Hong Kong British authorities.

	All staff of the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch expressed great indignation that the Hong Kong British fascist authorities, despite the strongest protest from the Chinese Foreign Ministry, dared to once again politically provoke the Chinese people. They pointed out that the Hong Kong British authorities must immediately fulfill the solemn demands made by the Chinese Foreign Ministry, Xinhua News Agency, and the Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch.

	The Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch, Hong Kong Chinese News Agency, Wen Wei Po, Ta Kung Pao, Xin Wan Bao, and Economic Digest, sent 18 representatives to the Hong Kong British "Governor's Office" to strongly protest the unreasonable beating, kidnapping, and various persecutions of patriotic journalists by the Hong Kong British authorities.

	When the representatives arrived at the Hong Kong British "Governor's Office," there was chaos inside. The "acting governor" David Trench did not dare to receive the representatives and even refused to accept the protest letter. The representatives immediately lodged a strong protest, repeatedly shouting in anger: "Protest the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities!" "Protest the unreasonable arrest of Xinhua journalists by the Hong Kong British authorities!" "Immediately release the Xinhua and Economic Digest journalists!" "Protest David Trench's refusal to see the news representatives!" "Oppose the Hong Kong British authorities' suppression of press freedom!" "Must guarantee the rights of journalists to conduct news interviews!" The representatives also shouted: "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

	The representatives' protest letter pointed out: The various persecutions of the Hong Kong British authorities against our patriotic journalists show that they are afraid of the sunlight, afraid of the truth, and afraid of the true reports of patriotic journalists, and afraid of the just newspapers.

	The protest letter emphasized: The truth cannot be covered up, and the correct reports of patriotic journalists cannot be blocked. The fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities will never suppress the surging anti-British and anti-fascist movement. Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Whatever the enemy opposes, we support; whatever the enemy supports, we oppose." He also says: "If others do not offend us, we do not offend them; if others offend us, we must offend them." We will resolutely follow Chairman Mao's teachings and fight to the end.

	The protest letter seriously warned the Hong Kong British authorities: They must immediately stop all fascist atrocities, immediately release Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch journalist Xue Ping, immediately release the unjustly sentenced Economic Digest journalist Xu Yuncheng, publicly apologize, and immediately stop the infringement of news interview freedom, guaranteeing the freedom of journalists to conduct interviews. Otherwise, all serious consequences must be borne by the Hong Kong British authorities.

    英帝又一次向中国人民进行政治挑衅
    港英当局悍然非法“审讯”我记者
    香港爱国新闻界强烈抗议港英迫害爱国记者
    新华社香港十二日电　疯狂的香港英国法西斯当局今天上午在“中央裁判署”，悍然对新华社香港分社记者薛平进行非法“审讯”。新华社香港分社工作人员当场在“法庭”上与港英当局展开斗争，再次提出最强烈的抗议。
    新华社香港分社工作人员今天获悉港英当局非法“审讯”新华社记者这一严重的政治挑衅消息时，个个义愤填膺，立即派出代表八人，前往“中央裁判署”抗议。在到达时，八名代表竟被港英当局无理拒绝入内。经过斗争后，只有持有“记者证”的新华社记者入内旁听。
    在“法庭”上，港英警方以所谓“非法集会”和“参加恐吓性集会”的莫须有“罪名”，“控告”新华社记者薛平。“法官”竟然胆敢决定将他“移交地方法院审讯”，企图进行更大的迫害。当时已进入“法庭”内的新华社记者马上高声抗议港英法西斯当局的迫害行为，并指出我国外交部已就此事向英国政府提出最强烈的抗议，要港英立即放人，否则一切严重后果由港英负责。这一坚决的行动吓得“法官”狼狈不堪，慌张离席，并指使港英警察用暴力将该记者强行扭出“法庭”外，还进行无耻的恫吓。
    被迫害的新华社记者薛平，蔑视港英“法官”，以坚定的语调当场提出三项抗议：抗议港英当局非法拘捕记者；抗议港英当局非法殴打记者；抗议港英当局践踏新闻自由。
    新华社香港分社全体工作人员对港英法西斯当局竟然无视我国外交部的最强烈抗议，胆敢又一次向中国人民进行政治挑衅，表示了无比的愤慨。他们指出，港英当局必须立即实现我外交部、新华通讯社和新华社香港分社所提出的严正要求。
    新华社香港十二日电  新华社香港分社、香港中国通讯社、《文汇报》、《大公报》、《新晚报》和《经济导报》等单位工作人员代表十八人，代表香港爱国新闻工作者，今天前往港英“总督府”，强烈抗议港英当局无理殴打、绑架和百般迫害爱国记者的暴行。
    代表们到达港英“总督府”时，“总督府”内一片混乱。“代理总督”祁济时不敢接见代表，连抗议书也拒绝接受。代表们马上提出强烈抗议，一再愤怒高呼：“抗议港英当局法西斯暴行！”“抗议港英当局无理拘捕新华社记者！”“立即释放新华社和《经济导报》记者！”“抗议祁济时拒见我新闻界代表！”“反对港英当局摧残新闻自由！”“必须保证记者一切新闻采访权利！”代表们还高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“伟大的领袖毛主席万岁！”
    代表们给祁济时的抗议书指出：港英当局对我爱国新闻工作者所作的种种迫害，说明他们怕见阳光，怕见真理，害怕爱国记者作真实报道，怕见正义的报章。
    抗议书强调指出：真理是遮挡不住的，爱国记者的正确报道是封锁不了的。港英当局的法西斯暴行，绝压不倒轰轰烈烈的反英抗暴运动。我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“凡是敌人反对的，我们就要拥护；凡是敌人拥护的，我们就要反对。”又说：“人不犯我，我不犯人；人若犯我，我必犯人。”我们坚决遵照毛主席的教导，针锋相对，斗争到底。
    抗议书严重警告港英当局：必须立即停止一切法西斯暴行，立即释放新华社香港分社记者薛平，立即释放被无理判刑的《经济导报》记者许云程，公开道歉，并立即停止对新闻采访自由的侵犯，保证新闻记者的采访自由，否则，一切严重后果，必须由港英当局负责。
