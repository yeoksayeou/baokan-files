The struggle of African Americans in the U.S. continues unabated. New waves of anti-violence protests have erupted in New York and other cities. In Detroit, African Americans are bravely and unyieldingly continuing their armed resistance against violence.

BEIJING, July 29 (Xinhua) — Washington: While the gunshots of African Americans resisting violence in Detroit have not yet ceased, new struggles have erupted in New York and several other cities. Meanwhile, the situation in cities like Washington is also tense, with African American struggles on the verge of erupting. American news agencies have exclaimed: The "riots" by African Americans are spreading like wildfire to many cities in the U.S.

In Detroit, despite being under martial law and shrouded in a white terror, some African American snipers were still bravely and tenaciously resisting on the nights of July 28 and the morning of July 29, waiting for opportunities to strike at the police and military. It is reported that the mayor of the city narrowly escaped being shot by a sniper during his "inspection" of the city on the night of July 28. By July 28, more than ten thousand fully armed police and military personnel were still patrolling and searching the city, and more than five thousand African Americans had been arrested.

In the Brooklyn African American neighborhood of New York City, more than five hundred angry African Americans held a demonstration early on July 29 to protest the police's brutal arrest of seven African American youths. The previous night, many African Americans in the suburban area of Vernon Mountain also attacked police cars with stones and glass bottles to express their protest.

At the same time, in Wilmington, Delaware, and Cambridge, Maryland, African American anti-violence struggles of varying scales have also erupted. In Wilmington, African Americans took up arms to defend themselves, injuring three white racists. African Americans in South Bend, Indiana, have been resisting for four days; the anti-violence struggle of African Americans in Chicago has also entered its third day. African Americans in Passaic, New Jersey, and Poughkeepsie, New York, have been fiercely resisting the rampaging police for two consecutive nights with guns, Molotov cocktails, stones, and glass bottles.

Faced with the surging wave of armed anti-violence struggles by African Americans, the U.S. ruling class is hurriedly devising countermeasures, plotting more brutal and overt bloodshed. Johnson personally convened a meeting with his newly appointed "Special Consultative Committee" on July 28 to discuss more extensive legislation and specific measures to suppress African American struggles. Meanwhile, the authorities in New York State and New Jersey have started large-scale "riot control" training for the police and military; in Tennessee, the authorities have ordered fifteen thousand National Guards to be on "constant alert." Some legislators are shouting at the top of their lungs, demanding severe punishment for African American movement leaders who "openly advocate rebellion," and calling to "lock them up forever."

    美国黑人斗争一浪接一浪
    纽约等地又爆发新的黑人抗暴斗争
    底特律市黑人英勇不屈坚持武装抗暴斗争
    新华社二十九日讯  华盛顿消息：底特律黑人抗暴的枪声还未停息，纽约和其他几个城市又爆发了新的黑人斗争；与此同时，华盛顿等十多个城市的局势也出现紧张气氛，黑人斗争有一触即发之势。美国通讯社惊呼：黑人“骚乱”，正象“野火”一样向美国许多城市蔓延。
    在底特律市，目前尽管处于军事占领状态，笼罩着一片白色恐怖，然而一些黑人狙击手在二十八日晚、二十九日清晨仍在英勇顽强地坚持斗争，伺机打击军警。据报道，这个市的市长在二十八日晚间“巡视”市区时差一点被狙击手打死。到二十八日，仍有一万多名全副武装的军警在市内巡逻、搜索，被捕的黑人已达五千多人。
    在纽约市的布鲁克林黑人区，五百多名愤怒的黑人二十九日清晨举行示威，抗议警察蛮横逮捕七名黑人青年；前一天晚上，市郊的维农山也有许多黑人用石块、玻璃瓶，袭击警车，表示抗议。
    同时，在特拉华州的威尔明敦，马里兰州的坎布里奇等城市也爆发了规模不等的黑人抗暴斗争。威尔明敦市黑人拿起武器进行自卫，打伤了三名白人种族主义者。印第安纳州南本德市黑人已经坚持斗争四天之久；芝加哥黑人的抗暴斗争也已经进入了第三天。新泽西州的帕塞伊克市和纽约州的波基普西市黑人一连两晚用枪、燃烧弹、石块和玻璃瓶狠狠打击肆虐的警察。
    面对着汹涌澎湃的黑人武装抗暴斗争浪潮，美国统治集团正在手忙脚乱地筹谋对策，阴谋进行更残酷更露骨的血腥镇压。约翰逊二十八日亲自同他新任命成立的“特别谘询委员会”一起开会，商讨更大规模镇压黑人斗争的反动立法和具体措施。同时，纽约州和新泽西州当局已经磨刀霍霍，开始对军警进行大规模的“控制暴乱”的训练；在田纳西州，当局已经下令一万五千名国民警卫队处于“经常戒备状态”。有的议员声嘶力竭地叫嚷，要严厉惩处“公开鼓吹造反”的黑人运动领袖，把他们“永远关起来”。
