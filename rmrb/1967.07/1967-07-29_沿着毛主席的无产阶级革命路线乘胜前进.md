On July 26, the leadership of the Wuhan Military Region of the Chinese People's Liberation Army issued a statement, publicly acknowledging errors in direction and line in their work of supporting the left, and resolving to draw a clear line with the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military in Wuhan, and to resolutely overthrow them. At the same time, they expressed their determination to quickly return to Chairman Mao's line of proletarian revolution, resolutely support the proletarian revolutionary masses in Wuhan, and do a good job in the "three supports, two military" work.

The stance and policies adopted by the Wuhan Military Region in this statement are correct, and have been warmly welcomed by the proletarian revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary masses in Wuhan. This is a heavy blow to the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military in Wuhan. This is a new victory for Chairman Mao's line of proletarian revolution.

The broad revolutionary masses and the soldiers and officers of the People's Liberation Army in Wuhan are raising the great banner of "supporting the army and loving the people" even higher, advancing along the line of proletarian revolution under Chairman Mao's guidance.

In the fierce class struggle, the broad soldiers and officers of the Wuhan garrison who have stood firmly with the proletarian revolutionary masses, have, at the critical moment, stood up, resolutely stood on the side of Chairman Mao's line of proletarian revolution, resolutely defended the proletarian headquarters headed by Chairman Mao, resolutely supported and defended the broad leftist masses, and made outstanding contributions to repelling the reactionary tide launched by the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military in Wuhan and the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes Army."

Some deceived cadres and soldiers have, through struggle, seen through the counter-revolutionary face of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military, and quickly returned to Chairman Mao's line of proletarian revolution.

Facts have once again proven that our People's Liberation Army is indeed a people's army without equal in the world, loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, loyal to Chairman Mao's line of proletarian revolution, and loyal to the great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Comrade Lin Biao. With such a strong backing and support, the proletarian revolutionary masses will certainly be invincible.

Since responding to Chairman Mao's great call to intervene in the local proletarian cultural revolution, the People's Liberation Army has achieved great success in the "three supports, two military" work, and has performed new meritorious deeds for the people. However, due to lack of experience and not fully understanding the revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat, it is inevitable that there will be various shortcomings and errors. Making mistakes, even mistakes in direction and line, is not a problem if they are corrected. The leadership of the Wuhan Military Region made errors in direction and line in their work of supporting the left, but the broad soldiers and the majority of cadres are not to blame. The leading cadres who made errors in direction and line have sincerely acknowledged their mistakes, seriously corrected them, and thoroughly broken with the capitalist reactionary line, resolutely supported the left, and resolutely fought against the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the military. This is also worthy of warm welcome. We hope that these comrades will perform new meritorious deeds for the people in their future work of supporting the left.

The situation of the proletarian cultural revolution in Wuhan is excellent. The proletarian revolutionary masses should raise high the banner of revolutionary great alliance, strengthen unity, correctly handle relations with the army, cooperate closely, and together direct the spearhead of struggle at the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and their agents in Wuhan, and carry the proletarian cultural revolution through to the end!

    沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线乘胜前进
    七月二十六日，中国人民解放军武汉部队领导机关发表公告，公开检讨了在支左工作中所犯的方向、路线错误，决心跟武汉地区党内军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派划清界限，坚决把他们打倒。同时，表示要迅速回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，坚决支持武汉地区的无产阶级革命派，做好“三支”“两军”的工作。
    武汉部队在这个公告中所采取的立场和政策是正确的，因而受到武汉地区的无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的热烈欢迎。这是对武汉地区党内军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的极为沉重的打击。这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的新胜利。
    武汉地区的广大革命群众和人民解放军广大指战员，正在更高地举起“拥军爱民”的伟大旗帜，沿着毛主席的无产阶级革命路线乘胜前进。
    在激烈的阶级搏斗中，紧紧与无产阶级革命派战斗在一起的武汉驻军广大指战员，在关键的时刻，挺身而出，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，坚决保卫以毛主席为首的无产阶级司令部，坚决支持和保卫左派广大群众，为打退武汉地区党内军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和“百万雄师”中一小撮坏头头所掀起的反动逆流，作出了杰出的贡献。
    一些受蒙蔽的干部和战士，在斗争中受到了深刻的教育，认清了党内军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反革命面目，迅速地回到了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    事实又一次证明，我们的人民解放军，不愧为忠于毛泽东思想，忠于毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，忠于伟大统帅毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志的举世无双的人民军队。无产阶级革命派有了这样坚强的后盾，坚强的靠山，就一定能无往而不胜。
    人民解放军响应毛主席的伟大号召，介入地方无产阶级文化大革命以来，在“三支”“两军”的工作中，取得了伟大的成绩，为人民立下了新功。但是，由于缺乏经验和对无产阶级专政下的革命不很理解，出现这样那样的缺点和错误，是难免的。犯了错误，甚至是方向路线的错误，改了就好。武汉部队领导机关在支左工作中犯了方向、路线错误，广大战士和大多数干部是没有责任的。犯了方向、路线错误的领导干部，诚恳地检讨错误，认真地改正，同资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂，坚决支持左派，坚决向党内军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派作斗争，也是应该热烈欢迎的。我们希望这些同志在今后的支左工作中为人民立新功。
    武汉的无产阶级文化大革命的形势，一片大好。无产阶级革命派要高举革命大联合的旗帜，加强团结，正确处理同军队的关系，密切合作，共同把斗争矛头指向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其在武汉地区的代理人，把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
