We poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and walk the path of socialism. However, the film "Two Families" forcibly portrays us poor and lower-middle peasants as two families walking two different paths.

The film depicts a "poor peasant" named Gao Zhengguo, who is always calculating his own gains, stuffing things into his pockets and hoarding them at home, not caring about his fellow poor peasants or socialism. For such a thorough money-lover, the film insists on calling him an "old poor peasant." Pfft! Stop smearing the faces of us poor and lower-middle peasants!

In our village, there are thousands of poor and lower-middle peasants, and not a single one is like him. We poor and lower-middle peasants love the socialist collective and walk the path of common prosperity.

Under the leadership of Chairman Mao and the Communist Party, since liberation, we poor and lower-middle peasants have stood up. However, individual economies cannot withstand the winds and rains, and within a year, our village saw a resurgence of poverty and wealth disparities. Some poor and lower-middle peasants took out high-interest loans, while others worked as day laborers. It was at this critical moment that Chairman Mao pointed out the bright path for all farmers nationwide: to organize and walk the path of common prosperity. We poor and lower-middle peasants were like fish in water and young shoots in the sun, our joy was indescribable. Several old poor peasants in the village took the lead, connecting with each other, and by the end of 1955, established the initial cooperative. Everyone had one heart for the cooperative, wholeheartedly wanting to make the cooperative successful, unlike the Gao Zhengguo in the movie who was always calculating his own gains. The reactionary film "Two Families" depicts this fake poor peasant Gao Zhengguo, intending to smear the faces of us poor and lower-middle peasants. We firmly oppose this!

　　不许往贫下中农脸上抹黑
　　北京通县翟里大队贫农　邓庆松
    我们贫下中农最听毛主席的话，走的是一条社会主义的大道。可是，影片《两家人》硬把我们贫下中农写成两家人，走两条不同道路。
    影片写了一个“贫农”高正国，他一门心思打自己的小算盘，啥东西都往怀里揣、家里搂，穷哥儿们不要，社会主义也不要。对于这样一个十足的老财迷，电影却硬说他是“老贫农”。呸！别往咱贫下中农的脸上抹灰了！
    我们村的贫下中农上千口人，哪一个也不象他那样。我们贫下中农爱的是社会主义这个大家庭，走的是共同富裕的道路。
    在毛主席和共产党的领导下，打解放起，我们贫下中农就翻了身。可是个体经济经不起风吹雨打，不到一年，我们村就又出现了贫富分化。有的贫下中农借高利贷，有的给人做短工。就在这关键的时刻，毛主席给全国农民指出了阳关大道：组织起来，走共同富裕的道路。我们贫下中农真象鱼儿得了水，嫩苗儿见了阳光，那高兴劲儿就甭提了。村里的几个老贫农，首先串连起来，在一九五五年底成立了初级社。大伙儿都一个心眼向着社里，一心一意要把社搞好，哪里象电影里的高正国一样，尽拨弄自个儿的小算盘。反动影片《两家人》写了这个假贫农高正国，就是要往我们贫下中农脸上抹黑，我们坚决不答应！
