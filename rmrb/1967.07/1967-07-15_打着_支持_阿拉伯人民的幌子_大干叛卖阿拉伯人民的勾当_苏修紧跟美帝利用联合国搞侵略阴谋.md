Under the guise of supporting the Arab people, the Soviet revisionists are engaged in treacherous activities against them. Following the secret meeting between Soviet revisionist leader Alexei Kosygin and U.S. imperialist head Lyndon Johnson in Glasburg, the Soviet revisionist leadership, in order to further cater to the needs of U.S. imperialism, is colluding with the U.S. through the United Nations to plot and conspire, attempting to force Arab countries to yield to the blackmail of American and Israeli aggressors, satisfying their aggressive ambitions.

After repeatedly manipulating the United Nations Security Council to draft resolutions favorable to the Israeli aggressors and unfavorable to the invaded Arab people, the Soviet revisionist leadership has gone even further in this direction. Kosygin, under the pretense of supporting the Arab people against aggression, rushed to the United Nations. However, in his first speech on June 19 at the United Nations, he clearly exposed the Soviet revisionist group's intention to follow the U.S. imperialists, using the United Nations as a tool to favor Israel and exert pressure on Arab countries. He blatantly stated that Israel's demands on its neighboring countries can be brought to the United Nations and "sought to be resolved through peaceful means." This is in line with Johnson's emphasis on the same day at a press conference that the United States "primarily supports effective activities by the United Nations to seek peace." After two lengthy discussions with Johnson, Kosygin, on June 25, again at a United Nations press conference, advocated that Israel withdraw its troops, "and then let the Security Council consider all other issues in the Middle East." This indicates that Kosygin is openly responding to the U.S. imperialists' demand for "conditional withdrawal," indulging Israeli aggression. Kosygin's coordination with Johnson on the Middle East issue is so close and so blatant that the U.S. government officials believe there is no need to conceal it. After the talks ended, U.S. government officials openly pointed out: Johnson's talks with Kosygin show that "on some issues between the Arabs and Israel, the U.S. and the Soviet Union seem to have adopted a somewhat consistent attitude."

After Kosygin returned from the U.S., the U.S. and the Soviet revisionists continued to engage in open "dialogue" on this matter. On July 6, U.S. Secretary of State Dean Rusk delivered a speech emphasizing that the United States "will continue to do its utmost" to reach "agreements and arrangements" with the Soviet Union to achieve a "lasting solution" to the Middle East problem. On July 8, U.S. government officials more explicitly stated: "The U.S. hopes are focused on" using the United Nations, especially "backdoor talks held in the Security Council," to quickly take action on the Middle East issue.

The U.S. imperialists' attempt to further collude with the Soviet revisionists to use the United Nations to promote their agenda of invading Arab countries has received an active response from the Soviet revisionist group. Following Soviet leader Leonid Brezhnev's guarantee on July 5 to "do everything possible to prevent the (Middle East) war from reigniting," Kosygin, on July 9, in a conversation with French journalists, again echoed Washington, emphasizing that "peaceful coexistence" is the "only possible way to maintain world peace," and that the Soviet revisionists will continue to "take all measures in the Security Council" to deal with the Middle East situation. He even shamelessly said: "We believe in the United Nations."

Meanwhile, Soviet Foreign Minister Andrei Gromyko, who accompanied Kosygin on his visit to the U.S., has been actively engaged in activities at the United Nations. In addition to maintaining close contact with Rusk and United Nations Secretary-General U Thant, he has frequently held talks with representatives of some Arab countries attending the emergency session of the General Assembly. On the other hand, Soviet military and political leaders have been constantly visiting the Middle East, lobbying and vigorously promoting the U.S.-Soviet conspiracy's so-called solution to the "Middle East crisis," attempting to induce Arab countries to surrender and make concessions to the U.S. and Israeli aggressors.

With the tacit approval and encouragement of the U.S. and the Soviet Union, the Israeli aggressors have become increasingly arrogant. Israeli Defense Minister Moshe Dayan threatened on July 5 to annex the Gaza Strip and the West Bank into Israeli territory. Israeli Prime Minister Levi Eshkol, on July 9, again declared that Israel would insist on occupying the Gaza Strip and annexing the entire city of Jerusalem. At the same time, Israeli troops have been continuously carrying out military provocations against Arab countries, coordinating with the political conspiracies of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists, and exerting pressure on Arab countries.

It is against this backdrop that the U.S., the Soviet Union, Britain, and France reached a so-called "gentlemen's agreement" through "backdoor negotiations" on the night of July 9, deciding to send "United Nations observers" to the Suez Canal area to "supervise" the ceasefire between Israeli invading forces and Egyptian troops, and hurriedly forced the Security Council to approve this decision in the early morning of July 10. This is a step to confirm the status quo of Israeli occupation of Arab countries' territory and to allow U.S. imperialists and Israeli aggressors to control the Suez Canal; it is also a step for U.S. imperialism to long-planned to bring United Nations forces back to Egypt, further utilizing the United Nations to serve U.S. aggression in the Middle East.

In addition, Soviet revisionist representatives have been actively working to push the General Assembly emergency session to adopt a resolution that does not distinguish right from wrong, does not condemn U.S. and Israeli aggressors, but actually only demands that the invaded Arab countries make concessions in exchange for Israeli withdrawal.

The emergency session, proposed by the Soviet revisionist leadership, has been dragging on for nearly a month, but because the Soviet revisionists proposed such a session, it was merely for cheap propaganda, to cover up their false support and true betrayal of the Arab people, as well as to cover up their backroom dealings with U.S. imperialism. Therefore, the session has been cold and half-dead, having to be adjourned repeatedly. Through this session, not only has the treacherous face of the Soviet revisionist leadership in betraying the interests of the Arab people been further exposed, but it has also once again proven that the United Nations has degenerated into a place for the two superpowers to conduct dirty political transactions. The oppressed peoples cannot expect it to solve any problems.

### 打着“支持”阿拉伯人民的幌子　大干叛卖阿拉伯人民的勾当  苏修紧跟美帝利用联合国搞侵略阴谋

    打着“支持”阿拉伯人民的幌子　大干叛卖阿拉伯人民的勾当
    苏修紧跟美帝利用联合国搞侵略阴谋
    新华社十四日讯　本社记者报道：在苏修头目柯西金同美帝头子约翰逊在葛拉斯堡罗密谋策划以后，苏修领导集团为了更进一步迎合美帝的需要，正在变本加厉地勾结美帝，通过联合国搞阴谋，企图迫使阿拉伯国家屈从美国和以色列侵略者的讹诈，满足它们的侵略野心。
    苏修领导集团在伙同美帝操纵联合国安理会一再炮制有利于以色列侵略者而不利于被侵略的阿拉伯人民的“停火决议”之后，在这方面越走越远。柯西金打着“支持”阿拉伯人民反对侵略的幌子跑到联合国去，然而，他在六月十九日在联合国的第一次讲话中，就清楚地暴露出苏修集团紧跟美帝，利用联合国这个工具来偏袒以色列，向阿拉伯国家施加压力的罪恶企图。他露骨地表示，“以色列对其邻邦有所要求”可以“到联合国来”，“通过和平方式谋求解决”。这和约翰逊在同一天的记者招待会上强调美国“首先支持联合国作出有效的谋求和平的活动”的论调如出一辙。柯西金在同约翰逊两次长谈之后，六月二十五日又在联合国记者招待会上鼓吹，以色列撤退军队，“然后再让安理会来考虑中东其他一切问题”。这就表明，柯西金在明目张胆地呼应美帝“有条件撤军”的主张，纵容以色列侵略。柯西金同约翰逊在中东问题上配合得如此紧密，如此露骨，以致美国官方认为不需要再加以掩饰。会谈结束后，美国政府官员毫不讳言地指出：约翰逊同柯西金会谈表明，“在阿拉伯—以色列的一些问题上，美苏似乎采取多少是一致的态度”。
    柯西金离美回国以后，美帝、苏修最近继续在这方面进行公开“对话”。七月六日，美国国务卿腊斯克发表演说，强调美国“将继续竭尽全力”来同苏联达成“协议和安排”，取得中东问题的“持久的解决”。八日，美国政府官员更明确地表示：“美国的希望集中在”通过联合国，特别是“在联合国安理会举行的幕后会谈”，来迅速在中东问题上“采取行动”。
    美帝国主义企图进一步伙同苏修利用联合国来推行它侵略阿拉伯国家的盘算，得到了苏修集团的积极响应。继苏修头目勃列日涅夫五日保证要“尽一切努力不使（中东）战火重燃”之后，柯西金九日在同法国记者谈话中，又同华盛顿遥相呼应，大讲什么“和平共处”是“保持世界和平的唯一可能性”，苏修将继续“在安理会采取一切措施”来对付中东局势，他竟然恬不知耻地说：“我们相信的是联合国”。
    与此同时，随同柯西金访美的苏联外交部长葛罗米柯一直留在联合国，大肆进行活动。他除了同腊斯克和联合国秘书长吴丹保持密切接触之外，还同出席联大紧急会议的一些阿拉伯国家代表频频举行了会谈；另一方面，苏修军政头目川流不息地往中东跑，进行游说，大力兜售美苏合谋的所谓解决“中东危机”的方案，企图诱迫阿拉伯国家向美、以侵略者屈服让步。
    在美苏的默许纵容下，以色列侵略者气焰越来越嚣张。以色列国防部长达扬五日扬言，要把加沙地带和约旦河西岸并入以色列的版图。以色列总理艾希科尔九日又叫嚷，以色列要坚持侵占加沙地带，吞并整个耶路撒冷。同时，以色列军队不断对阿拉伯国家进行军事挑衅，配合美帝苏修的政治阴谋，对阿拉伯国家施加压力。
    正是在这种背景下，美、苏、英、法四国九日夜间通过“幕后谈判”，达成了一项所谓“君子协定”，决定派遣“联合国观察员”进驻苏伊士运河地区，来“监督”以色列侵略军和阿联军队之间的“停火”，并在十日凌晨迫不及待地操纵安理会匆匆批准了这个决定。这是肯定以色列侵占阿拉伯国家领土的现状，并使美帝和以色列侵略者得以控制苏伊士运河的又一步骤；也是美帝国主义蓄谋已久的使联合国势力重返阿联、进一步利用联合国为美国侵略中东服务的又一步骤。
    除此以外，苏修代表还一直在积极活动，企图使联大紧急会议通过一项不分是非曲直、不谴责美、以侵略者，实际只是要求被侵略的阿拉伯国家让步来换取以色列撤军的决议。
    由苏修领导集团建议召开的这次紧急会议已经拖拖拉拉地开了快一个月，但由于苏修要求召开这样一次会议，本来不过是为了进行廉价宣传，掩饰一下它对阿拉伯人民的假支持、真出卖的面目，以及掩盖它同美帝进行幕后勾结，所以会议开得冷冷清清，半死不活，不得不一再休会。通过这次会议，不仅进一步暴露了苏修领导集团叛卖阿拉伯人民利益的可耻嘴脸，同时也再次证明，联合国已经堕落成为美苏两霸进行肮脏的政治交易的场所。被压迫人民根本不能指望它来解决什么问题。
