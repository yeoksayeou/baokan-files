The Soviet revisionist leadership clique is eagerly acting as a propagandist for American decadent culture. American hooligan dances, twist, and other dances filled with morbid and obscene movements have spread widely in the Soviet Union, poisoning and corrupting the Soviet people.

The Soviet revisionist leadership clique uses its propaganda machine to lavishly praise American "performed swing dances as pure, relaxed, and beautiful dances," and hypes up these low-level, decadent dances as "miracles of the atomic age."

Under the encouragement of the Soviet revisionist leadership clique's national policy of learning from America, many Soviet performing arts troupes have put on shows mimicking Western dances. The famous Moiseyev Dance Company and the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow are no exceptions.

In April 1961, the Moiseyev Dance Company visited the United States. An American newspaper commented on the troupe's performance of the "swing dance," saying, "We are no longer the leaders in 'swing dance.'"

In 1962, the Bolshoi Theatre visited the United States and even performed a striptease. This performance shocked the American ruling class. The *New York Times* commented on the Bolshoi Theatre's performance of composer Khachaturian's new work *Spartacus*, saying: "A group of actresses dressed in clothes that suit the taste of Minsky (a striptease club owner in Chicago) danced a performance that he would be very satisfied with."

The enthusiasm of some Soviet performing arts troupes in learning from America has increasingly attracted the attention of Western public opinion and has been cheered on. The widely circulated American magazine *Life* published a long report titled "Russian Swing Dance Stars" in its June 1964 issue. The report said: "Wow, such a thing really happened, Moscow has started to learn from Broadway... Their movements and glittering decorations can make any capitalist's pulse quicken." The report said that a Soviet song and dance troupe was performing in Paris, "To cater to the French audience's taste, young actresses used their youth to specially practice to increase the excitement of the performance."

Various Western dances have poisoned and corrupted Soviet youth through various channels. According to reports, young people crowd into dance halls that are packed to the brim, sometimes dancing all night long with these "shaking, stomping, and convulsing" dances. Sometimes at private parties, young people dance frantically to the yellow music played on records. Even at the All-Soviet Dance Competition, "you can find dancers who imitate the poses and strange costumes from foreign advertisements."

The widespread and rampant spread of Western dances in the Soviet Union has caused strong dissatisfaction among the broad masses of Soviet working people. People call these dances "dangerous dances," "dances of death," "monkey dances," and "inhuman." Many people write to newspapers saying: "Many young people dance wildly everywhere every night, which is disgraceful. It is no wonder that the view of dance halls as a symbol of all evil is becoming more and more solidified. What happens in dance halls can only make one's heart ache..."

### 美国阿飞舞在苏联泛滥

　　美国阿飞舞在苏联泛滥
    由于苏修领导集团竭力充当美国腐朽文化的传道士，美国的阿飞舞、摇摆舞和扭摆舞等掺杂着病态和猥亵动作的舞蹈，在苏联广泛流传，毒害和腐蚀着苏联人民。
    苏修领导集团利用宣传机器，大肆称赞美国“表演的‘摇摆舞’是纯朴、轻松和优美的舞蹈”，吹捧这些低级腐朽的舞蹈“已成为原子世纪的奇迹”。
    在苏修领导集团向美国学习的国策的鼓励下，苏联许多艺术团大演模仿西方舞蹈的节目。苏联著名的莫伊塞耶夫舞蹈团和莫斯科大剧院也毫不例外。
    一九六一年四月，莫伊塞耶夫舞蹈团访问了美国。美国的一家报纸在评论该团演出的“摇摆舞”时说，“我们在‘摇摆舞’方面也不是领先的了”。
    一九六二年，莫斯科大剧院访问美国，竟然跳起“脱衣舞”来了。这次演出，使美国统治阶级都感到“惊人”。《纽约时报》在评论大剧院演出作曲家哈恰图良的新作《斯巴达克斯》时说：“一群女演员穿着合乎明斯基（美国芝加哥脱衣舞老板）胃口的衣服，跳了一场他也会感到非常满意的舞”。
    苏联的一些艺术团向美国学习的劲头越来越引起西方舆论的注意，并为之喝采叫好。美国销路最广的杂志之一《生活》在一九六四年六月的一期上，发表了题为《俄国的摇摆舞明星》的长篇报道。报道说：“唷，真有这样的事，莫斯科开始学起百老汇来了……他们的动作和金光闪闪的装饰可以使任何资本家的脉搏加快”。报道说，一个苏联歌舞团正在巴黎演出，“为了迎合法国观众的胃口，年轻的女演员利用她们的年轻这一点进行了特别的练习来增加节目的刺激性”。
    西方的各种“舞蹈”通过各种渠道，毒害和腐蚀着苏联青年。据报道，青年们成群地挤在水泄不通的舞场里，有时通宵达旦跳着这种“动摇不停、蹬足踢腿、痉挛地抽动”的舞蹈。有时在私人舞会上，青年们随着唱片放送的黄色音乐，拚命地跳着这种扭捏作态的舞蹈。甚至在全苏舞蹈比赛大会上，“也可以找到模仿外国出版的广告画中的姿态和奇装异服的舞蹈家”。
    西方舞蹈在苏联广泛流传和恶性泛滥，引起了广大苏联劳动人民的强烈不满。人们把这类舞蹈称作“危险的舞蹈”、“死神在跳舞”，是“猴子跳的”，是“非人的”。许多群众给报社写信说：“许多年轻人在每个晚上都到处乱跳乱舞，不成体统。难怪人们把舞厅作为一切坏事的代名词的看法日益巩固了。舞厅里所发生的事情只能使人心疼……”。　（据新华社讯）
