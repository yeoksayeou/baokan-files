The Soviet revisionists' "humanitarianism" is what kind of thing?

A robber tries to put on a righteous face, and traitors insist on dressing up as heroes. The *Pravda*, which does not speak the truth, closely follows its master and plays the role of a clown. Recently, it published an article titled "Socialism and Humanitarianism," shamelessly claiming: "The slogans and actions of the advocates of China's Cultural Revolution are incompatible with the principles of socialist humanitarianism."

We all remember that Khrushchev once loudly proclaimed the bourgeois lie of "liberty, equality, fraternity," and said that the entire life of socialist society is permeated with "lofty humanitarian ideals." Anyone with a bit of Marxist-Leninist knowledge knows that those who use humanitarianism to obscure class struggle are merely servants of the bourgeoisie.

In our country's Cultural Revolution, the broad revolutionary masses have exposed a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They are thoroughgoing counter-revolutionary revisionists, Khrushchev-style careerists hiding among us, who want to usurp the Party, the government, and the army, and drag our country towards capitalism. Can we talk about "humanitarianism" with these bastards?

The unrepentant landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists in China harbor deep hatred for our socialist system and seek every opportunity to cause trouble and sabotage, attempting to restore the old order. Can we talk about "humanitarianism" with these harmful elements?

Capitalist and feudal old ideas, old culture, old customs, and old habits have poisoned us for hundreds and thousands of years. They are the breeding ground for revisionism. Should we not completely eliminate these filthy garbage, but instead talk about "humanitarianism" with them?

Against the enemy, against all ghosts and monsters, against all bourgeois evil things, we do not talk about "humanitarianism." We must overthrow them, expose them, eliminate them, and thoroughly cleanse their influence. We know that to talk about "humanitarianism" with them is the greatest inhumanity to the proletariat and the working people, the greatest crime against the proletariat and the working people, and the greatest crime against Marxism-Leninism. In his brilliant work *Carry the Revolution Through to the End*, Chairman Mao cited a Greek fable about a farmer and a snake. The farmer, out of pity for a frozen snake, revived it, only to be bitten to death by the snake. This is the result of pitying evil people. The Soviet revisionist gentlemen, your "socialist humanitarianism" is to cry out for all the poisonous snakes in China that are dying or about to die, to make us show them humanity, and let China go down the path you wish. Chairman Mao once pointed out with piercing insight: "Those who advise the people to pity the enemy and preserve reactionary forces are not friends of the people but friends of the enemy." The facts are as clear as day.

Soviet revisionist gentlemen, your ugly faces cannot deceive people. Your "socialist humanitarianism" has long been known to the world!

You lock up Soviet workers who oppose you in mental hospitals for "treatment" in the Soviet Union. You carry out a capitalist restoration, letting the broad masses of Soviet workers suffer under the oppression and exploitation of new-style nobles. This is your "socialist humanitarianism"!

You promote the ruble as the standard, money as everything, and advocate the American way of life, poisoning the youth. As a result, some people, for the sake of the ruble, remain unmoved when they see someone fall into the water and drown. Many young people drink alcohol and commit crimes. This is your "socialist humanitarianism"!

You arrest a big spy sent by American imperialism to the Soviet Union, but at the command of the imperialist boss, you quickly release him. You send police to suppress Chinese and foreign students in the Soviet Union who are protesting against American imperialism's aggression in Vietnam. This is your "socialist humanitarianism"!

You use every means to induce the Vietnamese people to lay down their arms and surrender to American imperialism, attempting to let the 31 million Vietnamese people be slaughtered. This is your "socialist humanitarianism"!

You want all the oppressed nations and peoples of the world to coexist peacefully with imperialism, in other words, to obediently suffer oppression and slavery, live like cattle and horses. This is your "socialist humanitarianism"!

You collude with American and British imperialism to suppress the Arab people, betray the cause of the Arab people's national liberation struggle. This is also your "socialist humanitarianism"!

Enough! What you call "socialist humanitarianism" is nothing but thoroughgoing revisionism, unadulterated capitalism, outright capitulationism, and complete national egoism.

Our great leader Chairman Mao has long pointed out with great wisdom: "The representatives of various exploiting classes, when they are in an unfavorable situation, in order to protect their current existence and future development, often adopt the strategy of attacking as a means of defense." Our Cultural Revolution has hit the vital and painful points of this gang of traitors, so they scream at the top of their lungs about how China's Cultural Revolution violates the "principles of socialist humanitarianism." They shout like this, only to boost their own morale.

When a handful of Soviet revisionist traitors have to rely on unreasonable attacks, insults, and rumors to survive, their doom is not far off.

    苏修的“人道主义”是什么货色？
    上海复旦大学红卫兵新复旦师红三团　新红兵
    强盗偏偏要装出一副正人君子的面孔，叛徒们也硬要穿上英雄的衣冠，不讲真理的《真理报》紧紧跟着自己的主子，扮演了一个小丑的角色。它不久前刊载的题为《社会主义和人道主义》的文章中，竟恬不知耻地说：“中国文化革命鼓吹者的口号和行动同社会主义人道主义的原则是不能相容的。”
    我们都记得，赫鲁晓夫曾经大肆宣扬资产阶级骗人的口号“自由、平等、博爱”，还说什么社会主义社会的整个生活都渗透了“崇高的人道主义的理想”。稍微有一些马列主义常识的人都知道，用人道主义来抹煞阶级斗争的人，只不过是资产阶级的奴仆。
    在我国的文化大革命中，广大革命群众揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。他们是彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义分子，是埋伏在我们身边的赫鲁晓夫式的野心家，他们要篡党篡政篡军，把我国拉向资本主义。对于这伙混蛋，我们能讲什么“人道主义”吗？
    中国的死不悔改的地富反坏右分子，对我国的社会主义制度怀着刻骨仇恨，寻找一切机会捣乱破坏，妄图复辟。对这些害人虫，难道我们能讲什么“人道主义”吗？
    资本主义、封建主义的旧思想、旧文化、旧风俗、旧习惯毒害了我们几百年、几千年。它们是产生修正主义的温床。对于这些污秽垃圾，我们难道不应该把它们彻底清除，反而跟它们讲什么“人道主义”吗？
    对于敌人，对于一切牛鬼蛇神，对于一切资产阶级的坏东西，我们就是不讲什么“人道主义”，就是要打倒它们，搞臭它们，消灭它们，彻底肃清它们的影响。我们知道，对它们讲“人道主义”，就是对无产阶级和劳动人民的最大不人道，就是对无产阶级和劳动人民的最大犯罪，对马列主义的最大犯罪。毛主席在他的光辉著作《将革命进行到底》里，讲到一个希腊寓言农夫和蛇的故事，农夫因为可怜一条冻僵的蛇，把它救活，后来却被蛇咬死，这就是怜惜恶人的结果。苏修老爷们，你们的“社会主义人道主义”就是为中国一切灭亡和将要灭亡的毒蛇喊冤叫屈，就是要我们对它们施行人道，让中国走上你们妄想的道路。对于你们“这些君子国的先生们”，毛主席曾一针见血地指出：“凡是劝说人民怜惜敌人、保存反动势力的人们，就不是人民的朋友，而是敌人的朋友了。”事实就是这样明明白白。
    苏修老爷们，你们那副丑恶嘴脸是骗不了人的。你们那套“社会主义人道主义”早就世人皆知了！
    你们在苏联把反对你们的苏联劳动者关进精神病院去“治疗”，你们大搞资本主义复辟，让苏联广大劳动人民受新型的贵族老爷的压迫和剥削。这就是你们的“社会主义人道主义”！
    你们在苏联搞卢布挂帅，金钱就是一切，宣扬美国生活方式，毒害青年。结果，有人为了卢布，看见有人失足落水而无动于衷，见死不救。有许多少年酗酒、犯罪。这就是你们的“社会主义人道主义”！
    你们把美帝国主义派到苏联的大间谍逮捕后，帝国主义头子一句话，就赶快把他释放了。你们派军警镇压反对美帝侵略越南游行的中国和外国留苏学生。这就是你们的“社会主义人道主义”！
    你们千方百计诱迫越南人民放下武器，向美帝投降，妄图让三千一百万越南人民任其宰割。这就是你们的“社会主义人道主义”！
    你们要全世界被压迫民族和被压迫人民同帝国主义和平共处，一句话，叫人家乖乖地受压迫，受奴役，过牛马生活。这就是你们的“社会主义人道主义”！
    你们与美英帝国主义串通一气，合谋镇压阿拉伯人民，出卖阿拉伯人民民族解放斗争事业，这也就是你们的“社会主义人道主义”！
    够了！你们所说的什么“社会主义人道主义”，不是别的，正是彻头彻尾的修正主义，不折不扣的资本主义，道道地地的投降主义，完完全全的民族利己主义。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席早就英明指出：“各种剥削阶级的代表人物，当着他们处在不利情况的时候，为了保护他们现在的生存，以利将来的发展，他们往往采取以攻为守的策略。”我们的文化大革命打到了你们这伙叛徒的要害和痛处，于是你们就声嘶力竭地叫嚷什么中国的文化大革命违反“社会主义人道主义的原则”。你们这样喊，不过是为自己壮壮胆而已。
    当一小撮苏修叛徒们不得不靠无理的攻击、谩骂和造谣来生活的时候，他们的末日就不远了。
