Japanese revolutionary people enthusiastically support the armed struggles launched by the people of Burma, India, and other Asian countries to overthrow reactionary rule, and point out that these struggles, guided by Mao Zedong Thought, are greatly encouraging to revolutionary people all over the world.

A reporter in Tokyo, Nagamin Yoshiki, told a reporter from the Oriental News Agency: "The development of armed struggles in Burma, India, and other Asian countries proves that the people of these countries have firmly grasped Chairman Mao's profound statement that 'the central task and the highest form of revolution is armed seizure of political power, and the solution of problems lies in war.' They are putting this into practice." Nagamin went on to say: "This is a heavy blow to imperialism and modern revisionism. It may be a spark, but it will certainly become a raging wildfire."

Nagamin said: "Whether or not to follow Chairman Mao's instruction to 'seize political power through the barrel of a gun,' and whether or not to support the armed struggles in Burma, India, and other countries, is the dividing line between true and false revolutionaries. The revisionist elements of the Japanese Communist Party have betrayed the revolution and fallen into parliamentary struggle, but the Japanese people will arm themselves with Mao Zedong Thought and overthrow them."

A publishing worker in Tokyo, Hatake Takashi, said that the armed struggles in Burma, India, and other places are conducted according to Mao Zedong Thought, which is the true revolutionary path and the universal law of revolution. Hatake pointed out: "Modern revisionists have abandoned this revolutionary principle and betrayed the people."

A truck driver, Takeda, said: "The armed struggle led by the revolutionary faction of the Indian Communist Party in the Darjeeling area has greatly encouraged revolutionary people all over the world. The Danji traitor group and a small number of revisionists in the Indian Communist Party deceive the people by advocating the revisionist 'parliamentary road,' and they will not bring any benefit to the people. In this situation, the Indian people have risen up to wage armed struggle, which fully proves that Chairman Mao's teaching that 'the central task and the highest form of revolution is armed seizure of political power, and the solution of problems lies in war' is a universal truth."

A book salesman, Ito, said: "The armed struggle led by the revolutionary faction of the Indian Communist Party is still a small spark in the whole of India, but the revolutionary faction of the Indian Communist Party has firmly grasped Mao Zedong Thought and correctly set the direction for the Indian people's revolutionary struggle." Ito further pointed out, "As long as the Indian people follow the path of people's war indicated by Chairman Mao, they will achieve great victories."

    日本人民欢呼印度等国人民武装革命必成燎原烈火
    毛主席的人民战争之路是胜利之路
    据新华社讯　据东方通讯社报道，日本革命人民热烈支持缅甸、印度以及亚洲各国革命人民所掀起的推翻反动统治的武装斗争，并指出，这是“在毛泽东思想的指引下展开的武装斗争”，这种斗争“极大地鼓舞了全世界革命人民”。
    在东京的一位新闻记者长南芳树对东方通讯社记者说：“缅甸、印度以及亚洲各国人民的武装斗争的发展，证明这些国家的人民紧紧掌握了毛主席说的‘革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题’这一英明论断，并且正在实践中。”长南接着指出：“这是对帝国主义和现代修正主义的沉痛打击。这可能是一点火星，但势必形成燎原烈火。”
    长南说：“是否照着毛主席指出的‘枪杆子里面出政权’去做，支持不支持缅甸、印度以及其他国家的武装斗争，是真假革命的分水岭。日共修正主义分子背叛革命，陷入议会斗争，但是日本人民必将用毛泽东思想武装起来把他们打倒。”
    东京的出版工人畑高志说，缅甸、印度等地的武装斗争是根据毛泽东思想进行的，这是真正的革命道路，这才是革命的普遍规律。畑高志指出：“现代修正主义者丢掉了这个革命原则，出卖了人民。”
    货车司机竹田说：“印度共产党革命派领导的大吉岭地区的武装斗争极大地鼓舞了全世界革命人民。丹吉叛徒集团和印度共产党中一小撮修正主义者欺骗人民，提倡修正主义的‘议会道路’，他们决不会给人民带来一点利益。在这种情况下印度人民奋起进行武装斗争，这充分证明，毛主席教导的‘革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题’这句话是普遍真理。”
    书籍推销员伊藤说：“印度共产党革命派领导的武装斗争从整个印度来看，还是很小的火花，但是印度共产党革命派已经紧紧掌握了毛泽东思想，正确地规定了印度人民革命斗争的大方向。”伊藤还指出，“印度人民只要走毛主席所指出的人民战争的道路，就会赢得伟大胜利。”
