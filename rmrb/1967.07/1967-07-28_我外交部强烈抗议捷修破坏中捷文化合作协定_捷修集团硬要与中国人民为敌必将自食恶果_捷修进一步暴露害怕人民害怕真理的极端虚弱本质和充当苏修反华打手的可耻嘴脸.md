	China's Foreign Ministry Strongly Protests Czechoslovakia's Sabotage of Sino-Czechoslovak Cultural Cooperation Agreement
	The Czechoslovak Revisionist Group Insists on Hostility Towards the Chinese People and Will Surely Suffer the Consequences
	The Czechoslovak Revisionists Further Expose Their Extreme Weakness and Fear of the People and Truth, as Well as Their Shameful Role as Henchmen of the Soviet Revisionists' Anti-China Campaign

	New China News Agency, July 27th

	The responsible official of the Soviet and Eastern European Affairs Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of our country summoned the Chargé d'Affaires of the Czechoslovak Embassy in China on the 27th and handed him a note, strongly protesting the Czechoslovak government's sabotage of the Sino-Czechoslovak Cultural Cooperation Agreement and further deterioration of Sino-Czechoslovak relations, and announcing the serious incident of "no longer accepting Chinese students to study in Czechoslovakia." The note also strongly protested to the Czechoslovak government regarding the Czechoslovak revisionist leading group's repeated public attacks on the great leader of the Chinese people, the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, Chairman Mao.

	The note said, ten Chinese students were sent to Czechoslovakia in 1965 according to the Sino-Czechoslovak Cultural Cooperation Agreement. To return home to participate in the Cultural Revolution, the Chinese Embassy pointed out to the Czechoslovak Ministry of Education in January 1967 that Chinese students would take a half-year leave of absence, and the Czechoslovak Ministry of Education agreed to this request. The relevant schools in Czechoslovakia also issued leave certificates to the ten Chinese students. In early February this year, Chinese students left Czechoslovakia to return home. On February 11th, the Czechoslovak Ministry of Education requested that the Chinese Embassy notify the Czechoslovak side of the date of return of our ten students by April this year to arrange for their studies. It is clear that the return of Chinese students to Czechoslovakia to resume their studies was originally not a problem. But more than twenty days after our students left Czechoslovakia, the Czechoslovak Ministry of Education suddenly notified the Chinese Embassy on February 28th that the Chinese students had allegedly distributed a so-called "attack" on the Soviet Union before leaving Czechoslovakia, and therefore, it would inevitably affect the Czechoslovak side's acceptance of Chinese students returning to Czechoslovakia to study and the relevant clauses in the two countries' cultural cooperation agreement execution plan for the exchange of university students and graduate students. This is a blatant provocation, and the Chinese side immediately refuted it strongly. Nevertheless, the Chinese side still respected the Czechoslovak Ministry of Education's request and, as scheduled, notified the Czechoslovak Ministry of Education on April 26th of the time for our students to return to Czechoslovakia to resume their studies. The Czechoslovak side expressed that it would give a reply in a month. But this matter was delayed for more than two months, and it was not until July 6th this year that the Czechoslovak Ministry of Education replied to the Chinese Embassy. When replying, the Czechoslovak representative blatantly broke his promise and did not mention the arrangements for our students' studies at all, repeating the unreasonable accusations against our students, and further proposing absurd demands to the Chinese Embassy, saying that only if the Chinese Embassy "officially expresses disagreement with the provocative activities of Chinese students" and "guarantees to the Czechoslovak side that Chinese students will not engage in similar activities in the future and will abide by the current laws of Czechoslovakia," could the Czechoslovak side "in principle be willing to reconsider the issue of accepting ten Chinese students to study in Czechoslovakia." Without waiting for the Chinese side to give a formal reply, the Czechoslovak Ministry of Education formally announced on July 13th that Chinese students could not return to Czechoslovakia to study. The course of events clearly shows that this incident was deliberately fabricated by the Czechoslovak revisionist leading group to follow the Soviet revisionists' anti-China campaign after careful planning.

	The note pointed out that the only excuse given by the Czechoslovak Ministry of Education for refusing to allow Chinese students to return to Czechoslovakia to study was that Chinese students had distributed so-called "attacking" materials on the Soviet Union before leaving Czechoslovakia. This is sheer nonsense. In January this year, the Soviet revisionist traitor group carried out bloody fascist suppression on Chinese students who went to lay wreaths at Lenin's Tomb and Stalin's Tomb in Red Square, injuring many Chinese students. This incident aroused the serious concern and indignation of revolutionary people and students from all over the world. However, the Czechoslovak revisionist leading group actively followed the Soviet revisionists, using every means to distort the facts, slander and attack the revolutionary actions of Chinese students in Red Square, and carried out frenzied anti-China propaganda. Under such circumstances, Chinese students studying in Czechoslovakia, in order to satisfy the strong demand of Czechoslovak students to know the truth, naturally had the obligation to provide them with relevant information and express their own attitudes. This is completely justified, completely necessary, and beyond reproach. The Czechoslovak revisionist leading group is terrified and enraged by the Chinese students exposing the heinous crimes of the Soviet revisionist leading group to the world, so they ordered that Chinese students would not be allowed to return to Czechoslovakia to study. Your unreasonable actions fully reflect your extremely weak nature of fearing the people and fearing the truth, and at the same time, further expose your shameful role as willing henchmen of the Soviet revisionists' anti-China campaign.

	The note said that it must be pointed out that your adoption of such methods is not accidental. In recent years, especially since the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in our country, your anti-China actions have become increasingly fierce, using all your propaganda machinery to slander, defame, and attack our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and domestic and foreign policies. What is particularly serious is that since this year, the leaders of the Czechoslovak revisionist leading group, ignoring our repeated protests, have personally taken the lead in publicly attacking our great leader, the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world, Chairman Mao. This is a very serious provocation to the 700 million Chinese people, and the 700 million Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate it. For this, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China strongly protests to the Czechoslovak government.

	The note said that it must also be pointed out that in recent years, you have taken a series of serious steps to sabotage Sino-Czechoslovak relations. In 1963, you unreasonably closed our Xinhua News Agency's branch in Prague, expelled all our journalists, as well as one staff member of the Chinese Embassy and one Chinese student; since last August, you have instigated thugs to smash and blow up the newsstand of the Chinese Embassy multiple times; illegally banned the distribution of propaganda materials by the Chinese Embassy; imposed discriminatory measures on the Chinese Embassy, unreasonably stipulating that the range of free activities for Chinese Embassy personnel should not exceed 30 kilometers from Prague, and so on.

	The note finally pointed out that we must once again warn the Czechoslovak revisionist leading group that you have already gone far down the road of anti-China. Our restraint has its limits. If you insist on being hostile to the Chinese people armed with great Mao Zedong Thought, then you will surely suffer the consequences.

    我外交部强烈抗议捷修破坏中捷文化合作协定
    捷修集团硬要与中国人民为敌必将自食恶果
    捷修进一步暴露害怕人民害怕真理的极端虚弱本质和充当苏修反华打手的可耻嘴脸
    新华社二十七日讯  我国外交部苏联东欧司负责人二十七日召见捷克斯洛伐克驻中国大使馆临时代办，交给他一份照会，强烈抗议捷克斯洛伐克政府破坏中捷文化合作协定、进一步恶化中捷关系，宣布“不再接受中国学生来捷学习”的严重事件。照会并就捷修领导集团多次公开指名攻击中国人民的伟大领袖、世界人民心中的红太阳毛主席一事，向捷克斯洛伐克政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    照会说，中国十名学生是一九六五年根据中捷文化合作协定派往捷克斯洛伐克学习的。为了回国参加文化大革命，中国大使馆于一九六七年一月向捷教育部指出，中国学生休学半年，捷教育部同意了这项要求，捷有关学校还给十名中国学生发了休学证书。今年二月初，中国学生离捷回国。二月十一日，捷教育部要求中国大使馆于今年四月将我十名学生返捷日期通知捷方，以便安排学习。可见，中国学生返捷复学，本来已不成什么问题。但当我学生离开捷克斯洛伐克二十多天之后，捷教育部突然于二月二十八日通知中国大使馆，说什么中国学生离捷前在捷学生中散发了所谓“攻击”苏联的声明，因此，不能不影响捷方接受中国学生返捷学习和在两国文化合作协定执行计划中列入互换大学生和研究生的有关条款。这是明目张胆的挑衅行为，中国方面当场就给了有力的驳斥。尽管如此，中国方面仍然尊重捷教育部的要求，如期于四月二十六日将我学生返捷复学的时间通知了捷教育部。捷方表示，一月后给予答复。但此事拖了两个多月，直到今年七月六日，捷教育部才答复中国大使馆，答复时，捷方代表竟然违背诺言，只字不提对我学生的学习安排，重复对我学生的无理指责，并进一步向中国大使馆提出荒谬要求，说什么只有在中国大使馆“正式表示不赞同中国学生的挑衅活动”和“向捷方保证中国学生今后不再发生类似活动，遵守捷现行法律”的条件下，捷才能“在原则上愿意重新考虑接受中国十名学生来捷学习的问题”。捷教育部未待中国方面正式答复，于七月十三日就迫不及待地正式宣布中国学生不能返捷学习。事情的经过清楚地表明，这个事件是捷修领导集团为了追随苏修反华，经过精心策划而蓄意制造出来的。
    照会指出，捷教育部拒绝中国学生返捷学习的唯一借口，是中国学生离捷前散发了所谓“攻击”苏联的材料。这完全是一派胡言。今年一月，苏修叛徒集团在莫斯科红场对前往列宁墓和斯大林墓敬献花圈的中国学生实行了血腥的法西斯镇压，打伤中国学生多名。这一事件引起了各国革命人民和青年学生的严重关切和无比愤慨。但是，捷修领导集团积极追随苏修，千方百计地歪曲事实，诬蔑和攻击中国学生在红场的革命行动，疯狂进行反华宣传。在这种情况下，中国留捷学生为了满足捷广大学生要求了解事实真相的强烈愿望，当然有义务向他们提供有关情况和表明自己的态度。这样做，是完全正当的，是完全应该的，是无可非议的。捷修领导集团对于中国学生把苏修领导集团的滔天罪行公诸于世，怕得要死，恨得要命，于是下令不让中国学生返捷学习。你们这一无理行径，充分反映了你们害怕人民，害怕真理的极端虚弱的本质，同时也进一步暴露了你们甘心充当苏修反华打手的可耻嘴脸。
    照会说，必须指出，你们采取这种做法，决不是偶然的。几年以来，特别是我国无产阶级文化大革命以来，你们反华愈演愈烈，开动全部宣传机器对我国无产阶级文化大革命和内外政策，极尽造谣、诬蔑、攻击之能事。特别严重的是，今年以来，捷修领导集团的头目，不顾中国方面的历次抗议，多次亲自出马，公开指名攻击我国人民的伟大领袖、世界人民心中的红太阳毛主席。这是对七亿中国人民的极其严重的挑衅，七亿中国人民绝对不能容忍。对此，中华人民共和国外交部向捷克斯洛伐克政府提出最强烈的抗议。
    照会说，还必须指出，几年来，你们采取了一系列严重破坏中捷关系的步骤。一九六三年，你们无理封闭我新华社驻布拉格分社，赶走我全部记者以及中国大使馆工作人员和留学生各一名；从去年八月起，你们指使暴徒，多次打砸和炸毁中国大使馆的新闻橱窗；非法禁止中国大使馆散发宣传材料；对中国大使馆采取特殊的歧视措施，无理规定中国大使馆人员自由活动的范围不得超过布拉格三十公里等等。
    照会最后指出，我们要再次正告捷修领导集团，你们在反华道路上已经走得很远了。我们的克制是有限度的。如果你们硬要与用伟大的毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民为敌，那么，你们必将自食其恶果。
