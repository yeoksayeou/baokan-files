The Ne Win clique is a greedy vampire
Implementing reactionary economic policies to ruthlessly exploit the masses
Severe economic crisis leaves people destitute and grumbling

According to a report by our correspondent from Xinhua News Agency on the 22nd: The Ne Win reactionary government has, since coming to power, ruthlessly plundered and exploited the broad masses of laboring people. Through so-called "nationalization," it has seized the medium and small-scale industries and commerce of the national bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie, developing state monopoly capitalism controlled by the military clique. These reactionary policies have led to a severe economic crisis in Burma, causing industrial and agricultural production to plummet, supplies to be tight, prices to soar, and people to be destitute and grumbling.

In the past two years, the evil consequences of the reactionary policies implemented by the Ne Win reactionary government have become increasingly severe. In Burma, one of the world's major rice-exporting countries, agricultural production has sharply declined, leading to a severe food shortage. On June 17th, the Burmese Ministry of Trade issued a notice stating that due to "last year's unprecedented poor harvest," rice production has decreased by one-third. This year, Burma will only have 7.1 million tons of rice available for domestic sale, and 4 million tons have already been sold. The notice indicates that there will be no rice to eat from November to December before the new harvest comes in. Despite this, the Ne Win reactionary government, which does not care about the lives of the people, continues to demand that the people tighten their belts to support its exports.

Currently, the supply of rice is in crisis throughout Burma. Not only are cities short of rice, but rural areas are also short of rice. Rationing of rice has been implemented in Rangoon. The Ne Win reactionary government stipulates that adults can only buy a small box of rice per day, and children can only buy half a box (each box is approximately 5.5 Chinese taels). In some places, even this amount cannot be guaranteed, and people have resorted to eating grass roots and tree bark.

Recently, there have been anti-hunger protests by the people demanding food from the Ne Win reactionary government. On June 9th, in the streets of Rangoon, more than a hundred residents, unable to cook because of the lack of rice, brought their children to protest in front of the trading company. In the Baan area, tens of farmers from rural villages organized a delegation to Baan to complain to the authorities that they had no rice to eat and could not survive by eating bamboo and straw.

Due to the food shortage and the reduction in other agricultural products, Burma is currently facing a shortage of supplies. Food oil, cloth, medicine, and other necessities are in short supply, prices are soaring, and the black market is rampant, with prices generally five to ten times the official price. Many officers and civil servants of the Ne Win reactionary government are involved in black market activities. However, the Ne Win reactionary government continues to raise prices. Starting from May 1st, it raised the retail prices of fifteen daily necessities, including salt, plastic products, ceramics, and stationery. Among them, the price of salt was increased by 66%. This has made the lives of the broad masses of people, especially farmers, extremely difficult.

Burma's current economic crisis is the result of the Ne Win clique's ruthless plundering policies in the economic sphere. After seizing power through a military coup in March 1962, the Ne Win clique quickly colluded with landlords and rich peasants in the countryside to ruthlessly exploit farmers. In September 1964, it announced government control over thirty-four agricultural products, forcibly purchasing them at low prices. It also seized the medium and small-scale industries and commerce of the national bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie. In October 1963, it promulgated the "Nationalization of Enterprises Law," which is a bandit-like plunder of national industrialists and businessmen, giving the government the right to take over any private enterprise. On March 19, 1964, it suddenly issued an order to nationalize all wholesalers, brokers, department stores, and cooperatives in Rangoon, and then on April 9th, it extended the commercial nationalization order to all parts of the country. By late April, it had taken over more than ten thousand stores nationwide.

Moreover, on May 17, 1964, the Ne Win reactionary government suddenly ordered the cessation of the use of 100 and 50 currency notes, requiring holders of such notes to exchange them with the government within a week, with each person only able to exchange approximately one-tenth of the original amount in small denomination notes. The rest were forcibly deposited in banks, effectively confiscated.

Through these reactionary measures of seizing medium and small-scale industrialists and businessmen and exploiting the laboring people, the Ne Win military clique has completely controlled Burma's financial and monetary system, foreign trade, industry, commerce, transportation, and other economic lifelines, causing serious consequences in all economic aspects. Its commercial "nationalization" has disrupted commercial channels, causing the exchange of goods between urban and rural areas to be cut off. Medium and small-scale industries have stopped production due to a lack of raw materials, leading to a sudden increase in urban unemployment. According to an official announcement by Burma in February 1963, the number of unemployed in urban areas had reached one million. In rural areas, farmers were already suffering from feudal exploitation such as rent and usury, and with the Ne Win military clique's low-price forced purchase of agricultural products, they have suffered endless disasters.

The strong discontent of the broad masses of people from all walks of life in Burma has developed into a revolutionary struggle against the Burmese reactionary government. The armed struggle led by the Burmese Communist Party is growing stronger day by day. The Ne Win reactionary government's backward policies are only digging its own grave.

    奈温集团是贪得无厌的吸血鬼
    推行反动的财经政策残酷剥削广大人民
    严重的经济危机弄得民不聊生怨声载道
    据新华社二十二日讯  本社记者报道：缅甸奈温反动政府上台以来，对广大劳动人民进行残酷的掠夺和剥削，并通过所谓“国有化”兼并民族资产阶级和小资产阶级的中小工商业，发展军人集团控制的国家垄断资本主义，这种反动政策，造成了缅甸严重的经济危机，使工农业生产急剧下降，物资供应紧张，物价飞涨，民不聊生，怨声载道。
    近两年来，奈温反动政府执行的这种反动政策的恶果日益严重，以致在世界上输出大米的主要国家之一的缅甸，农业生产急骤下降，发生了严重的粮荒。缅甸贸易部六月十七日发表通告说，由于“去年空前的歉收”，大米产量减少三分之一，今年缅甸只能有七十一万吨大米供国内出售，而目前已经出售了四十万吨。通告表示，在今年十一月和十二月新粮上市以前，将会没有米吃。尽管如此，不顾人民死活的奈温反动政府，却一再要人民勒紧裤带，供它出口。
    目前，大米供应已在全缅各地告急。不仅城市缺米，农村也缺米。仰光已实行大米“定量供应”。奈温反动政府规定，成年人每天只允许买一小牛奶盒米，小孩每天半盒（每盒约合中国五两多一点）。有的地方，连这一点数量也不能保证，出现了吃草根树皮的现象。
    最近发生了人民向奈温反动政府要饭吃的反饥饿示威。六月九日，在缅甸首都仰光市，有一条街的一百多市民，因为没有米做饭，带着他们的孩子，到贸易公司门前示威。在巴安一带，有十几个农村的农民组织了一个代表团，到巴安向当局控诉说，他们已没有米吃了，他们不能靠吃竹子和稻草活命。
    由于粮荒和其它农产品减产，目前缅甸物资紧张，食油、布匹、医药及其它生活必需品奇缺，物价高涨，黑市猖獗，价格一般为官价的五倍至十倍。奈温反动政府的许多军官和文职官员，都参加了黑市活动。但是，奈温反动政府继续抬高物价。从五月一日起，又抬高食盐、塑料制品、瓷器、文具等十五种日用必需品的零售价格。其中，食盐价格提高了百分之六十六。这使广大人民，特别是农民的生活非常困难。
    缅甸目前的经济危机，是奈温集团这一伙贪得无厌的吸血鬼在经济方面实行残酷的掠夺政策的恶果。奈温集团在一九六二年三月靠军事政变上台后，加紧同农村的地主和富农勾结，对农民进行残酷的压榨。一九六四年九月，还宣布了由政府管制三十四种农产品，以低价强迫收购。它还兼并民族资产阶级和小资产阶级的中小工商业。它在一九六三年十月颁布了完全是对民族工商业者进行盗匪式掠夺的“企业国有化法”，规定政府有权接管任何私营工商企业。一九六四年三月十九日又突然公布了一道命令，把仰光所有的批发商、经纪商、百货商店和合作社等收归国有，接着，又在四月九日把商业国有化命令推广到全国各地，到四月下旬就在全国接管了一万多家商店。
    不仅如此，奈温反动政府在一九六四年五月十七日又突然下令停止使用一百元和五十元大钞，规定持此类大钞者在一周内交政府，每人只能换回大约相当于原数十分之一的小面额钞票。其余一律强制存入银行，等于没收。
    奈温反动政府通过这一反动措施，共掠夺大钞九亿七千万缅元，相当于当时货币流通总数二十三亿缅元的百分之四十二。
    奈温军人集团通过这样一些剥夺中小工商业者和压榨劳动人民的反动措施，完全控制了缅甸的财政金融、对外贸易、工业、商业、交通运输业等经济命脉，在经济各方面造成了严重后果。它的商业“国有化”，打乱了商业渠道，使城乡物资交流中断。中小工业因原料不足纷纷停工减产，使城市失业人口骤然增加。据一九六三年二月缅甸官方宣布，全缅城镇失业人口已达一百万人。在农村中，农民本来已深受地租和高利贷等封建剥削之苦，加上奈温军人集团的低价强迫收购农产品等等，更加使他们遭到无穷的灾难。
    缅甸各阶层广大人民的强烈不满，已发展成为对缅甸反动政府的革命斗争。缅甸共产党领导的人民武装斗争，正在日益发展壮大。奈温反动政府的倒行逆施，只不过是自掘坟墓而已。
