The Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique in Indonesia, since launching a counterrevolutionary coup in early October 1965, has on the one hand carried out mass slaughter and mass arrests nationwide, and imposed white terror, and on the other hand, has ruthlessly exploited the Indonesian people economically, causing unprecedented disaster for the Indonesian nation. This rich and beautiful archipelago is now in a state of utter chaos: factories are shutting down, fields are lying fallow, prices are soaring, and the people are wandering aimlessly, with the entire nation in a state of disarray.

Basic industries have almost entirely ceased production

According to reports from the Indonesian newspaper *Sin Po*, as a result of the reactionary policies of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique, all but one light bulb factory in Indonesia’s basic industrial sector have ceased production. The operating rate of light industries nationwide is only 30 to 50 percent. Eighty percent of textile mills have closed down, leaving 500,000 workers unemployed. About 1,000 small garment factories in Jakarta are also facing bankruptcy, with 75 already declared insolvent. The production of rubber, oil, tin, copra, sugar, and other products, which play a crucial role in Indonesia’s national economy, has also significantly decreased. According to a recent report from *Bintang Timur*, Indonesia, once the world’s second-largest sugar producer, has now become a sugar-importing country.

Agricultural production has plummeted

Agricultural production, particularly rice production, has also sharply declined. According to *Pedoman Rakyat*, the main grain-producing region of West Java saw a rice yield of only 450 million tons last year, a decrease of about 40 million tons from 1965. The newspaper also reported that the production of cassava, sweet potatoes, soybeans, cucumbers, and other vegetables in this region has also decreased. In late April, Agriculture Minister Sujipto admitted that the area of rice cultivation nationwide has further shrunk this year. Reports indicate that tea and other cash crops are also facing severe difficulties. Currently, five private tea plantations have ceased production, and other plantations are "facing the same fate." Private rubber plantations in Aceh and Sumatra are currently in a state of "emergency."

Military and administrative expenses account for 80% of the budget

While industrial and agricultural production have been severely damaged and national income has significantly decreased, the Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique has drastically increased spending, further burdening the people. Apart from corruption and embezzlement to fill their own pockets, to maintain their counterrevolutionary rule, they have greatly expanded the military and bureaucratic apparatus, leading to a massive increase in non-productive expenditures. Reports indicate that the Indonesian armed forces have increased from over 400,000 to over 600,000. The total number of civil servants, which was 809,000 in 1961, has now surged to 2 million. In this year’s budget expenditure, military and administrative expenses account for 80 percent. According to *Fajar Kebangsaan*, the amount of prepayment from banks to this fascist regime has sharply increased. In the first quarter of this year, 2,335.25 billion rupiah was prepaid, an increase of 70 times compared to the same period last year.

Currency circulation increased by 50 times in one year

Due to the decline in production, reduced income, and increased spending, the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime, to cover the deficit, has been printing money recklessly, causing unprecedented inflation. *Berita Yudha* in Jakarta stated: "To cover the deficit, the government rushed to the printing press, declaring paper as a legal means of payment." In mid-May, Suharto, the head of the Indonesian fascist military regime, admitted that Indonesia’s inflation last year set a "record of the worst in any country in the world in the past 15 years." According to *Fajar Kebangsaan*, citing official figures, the currency circulation in the first quarter of this year was 2,033.14 billion rupiah, an increase of 50 times compared to the same period last year! Agriculture Minister Sujipto said, "The current situation is that there is seemingly uncontrollable inflation, accompanied by chaotic price fluctuations, making our economy like an endless mess of ruins."

At the same time, the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime has arbitrarily raised prices. On February 10, Information Minister Diah announced the official decision to sharply increase gasoline, transportation, electricity, and postal fees. Overnight, gasoline prices increased by eight times, electricity by four times, bus fares by three times, and domestic postal fees by nearly seventeen times! Shortly after announcing this decision, Diah was forced to admit that this was an "unpopular measure." *Bintang Timur* reported, "With official prices of goods rising one after another, free market prices have also risen even more sharply... Rice prices are rising every day."

A month’s wage only buys three bottles of soy sauce

The various regressive policies of the Suharto-Nasution fascist military regime have plunged the Indonesian people into deep water and fire, struggling on the brink of starvation, and the Indonesian nation is suffering an unprecedented heavy disaster. According to recent reports from Japanese bourgeois newspapers, if the consumption index of the Indonesian people in 1957 is set at 100, then in July 1966 it had risen to 150,000! Indonesian right-wing newspapers also admit that "a sergeant with four children has a monthly salary of only 34 rupiah, which is only enough to buy three bottles of soy sauce." According to Western news agencies, in Indonesia, "a university professor’s monthly salary is 260 rupiah, and a taxi driver’s monthly income is 150 rupiah. Students working in government offices in the morning earn 100 rupiah. In Indonesian restaurants, a small bottle of whiskey costs 110 rupiah."

Due to economic collapse, urban workers are massively unemployed, and rural populations who have lost their land and livelihood are flooding into cities, with beggars and refugees everywhere. According to Jakarta newspapers, since November 1965, in just ten months, over 50,000 people starved to death on Lombok Island, which has a population of over 1 million. In a village of 2,000 people, 600 died of starvation.

Chairman Mao said: "'Lifting a stone to drop it on one's own foot' is a Chinese proverb describing the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of various countries are precisely such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on revolutionary people ultimately can only promote more extensive and more intense revolutions among the people." The Suharto-Nasution fascist military clique is precisely such a bunch of fools; their various persecutions of the Indonesian people will inevitably promote more extensive and more intense revolutions among the Indonesian people.

    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团倒行逆施造成严重恶果
    印尼全国经济百孔千疮  广大人民陷于空前灾难
    印度尼西亚苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团从一九六五年十月初发动反革命政变后，一方面在全国大屠杀、大逮捕，大肆推行白色恐怖，一方面在经济上对印尼人民大肆盘剥，给印尼民族造成了空前的灾难。印度尼西亚这个富饶的千岛之国目前的情景是：工厂倒闭、田野荒芜、物价飞涨、人民颠沛流离，全国百孔千疮。
    基本工业部门几乎全部停工
    据印尼《新先锋报》报道，由于苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团一系列反动政策的结果，目前印尼基本工业部门所属企业，除了一家电灯泡工厂以外，其余全部停工。全国轻工业的开工率只有百分之三十到五十。全国百分之八十的纺织厂已经倒闭，在这些纺织厂劳动的五十万工人全部失业。雅加达约一千家民间花裙企业目前也面临倒闭的威胁，其中七十五家已经宣告破产。在印尼国民经济中占有极重要地位的橡胶、石油、锡、椰干、糖等产品的产量也大大下降。据《合作报》最近报道，印尼曾经是世界第二个产糖国，现在却变成了进口糖的国家。
    农业产量急剧下降
    农业产量，特别是大米产量也急剧下降。据《社会使者报》报道，粮食主要产区的西爪哇地区，去年稻谷产量只有四百五十万吨，比一九六五年减产约四十万吨。这家报纸说，这个地区的木薯、蕃薯、大豆、黄瓜和其他蔬菜的产量也下降了。印尼农业部长苏吉普托四月下旬承认，今年全国水稻种植面积又进一步缩小。据报道，茶叶等经济作物也面临十分严重的困难。目前，全国已有五个私营茶园停产，其他茶园也“面临同样的命运”。亚齐和苏门答腊的私营橡胶种植园目前正处于“紧急状态”。
    军政费用占预算百分之八十
    在工农业生产受到极大摧残、国民经济收入大为减少的同时，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团却急剧地增加开支，极力加重人民负担。这个法西斯军人集团除了贪污盗窃、大饱私囊以外，为了维持其反革命统治，还大大扩展了军事官僚机构，使非生产性开支大量上升。据报道，印尼武装部队已由原来的四十多万增加到六十万人以上，全国公务人员总数一九六一年为八十万九千人，现在也已猛增到二百万。在今年的预算支出中，军事和行政费开支竟占百分之八十。据《贫民火炬报》报道，银行给这个法西斯政权的预付款项剧烈上升。今年第一季度已预付两千三百三十五亿五千二百五十万盾，比去年同期增加了七十倍。
    纸币流通量一年增长五十倍
    由于生产下降，收入减少，开支剧增，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权为弥补亏空，乱发钞票，造成了空前的通货膨胀。雅加达《自力更生报》说：“为了弥补亏空，政府就跑到钞票印刷厂去，宣布纸张为合法的支付手段”。印尼法西斯军人政权的头目苏哈托今年五月中旬承认，印尼去年的通货膨胀创造了“十五年来世界上任何国家当中最坏的纪录”。据《贫民火炬报》援引官方公布的数字，今年第一季度货币流通量为两千零三十三亿一千四百万盾，比去年同期增加了五十倍！农业部长苏吉普托说，“目前的情况是，存在着似乎无法控制的通货膨胀，伴随着物价混乱现象，致使我们的经济形同一望无际的乱七八糟的废圩。”
    与此同时，苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权还肆意抬高物价。宣传部长迪亚今年二月十日宣布了汽油费、交通费、电费和邮费的激剧涨价的官方决定，一夜之间，汽油上涨八倍，电费上涨四倍，公共汽车费上涨三倍，国内邮费则暴涨近十七倍！迪亚在宣布这项决定后不久也不得不承认，这是一项“不受欢迎的措施”。《合作报》说，“随着官价货物相继涨价，自由市场物价也更加猛烈上升……米价天天上涨。”
    一月工资只够买三瓶酱油
    苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人政权的这种种倒行逆施，使广大印尼人民陷于水深火热之中，挣扎在饥饿线上，印尼民族正蒙受着无比沉重的灾难。据日本资产阶级报刊最近报道，印尼人民的消费指数如以一九五七年为一百，“那么一九六六年七月则上升为十五万”！印尼右派报纸也承认，“一个有四个孩子的中士，每月工资只有三十四盾，只够用来购买三瓶酱油。”据西方通讯社报道，在印尼，“一个大学教授的月薪是二百六十盾，一个出租汽车司机每月的收入为一百五十盾。上午在政府机关里工作的学生收入为一百盾。在印尼饭店的酒吧间里，一小瓶威士忌酒就要一百一十盾”。
    由于经济凋敝，城市劳动人民大量失业，失去土地和生计的农村人口大批流入城市，全国各城市到处充满着乞讨和逃荒的人群。据雅加达报纸报道，从一九六五年十一月份起，十个月内，仅巴厘岛东面的龙目岛，在一百多万人口中就饿死了五万人。在一个两千人的村子里，就有六百人饿死。
    毛主席说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯军人集团正是这样的一批蠢人，他们对印尼人民的种种迫害，必将促进印尼人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。
