The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association issued a statement on July 23, strongly condemning the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong for persecuting Chinese journalists in Hong Kong and seriously violating press freedom. The statement solemnly demands that the British authorities in Hong Kong must immediately and unconditionally release all Chinese patriotic journalists who have been unjustly arrested.

The statement points out that the facts of the British authorities in Hong Kong persecuting Chinese journalists show that the imperialists are terrified of the spread of truth, finally exposing the fraud of so-called "press freedom" and revealing their fascist, ugly faces.

The statement says that the bloody atrocities of British imperialism will not only fail to achieve their goal of prolonging their evil rule but will only "lift a rock to drop on their own feet." As Chairman Mao Zedong has pointed out: "The lifespan of the imperialists will not be long, because they do nothing but evil." The Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association is deeply convinced that the just struggle of our colleagues in Hong Kong will be victorious, and that U.S. and British imperialism and their Soviet revisionist accomplices will ultimately face the merciless judgment of the people and meet their doom.

The statement says that the Secretariat of the Asian-African Journalists Association extends warm greetings to Mr. Xue Ping and other Chinese journalists who have been persecuted by the British authorities in Hong Kong, and firmly supports and highly admires their fearless struggle in the British fascist "court." This brave act of turning the enemy's "court" into a platform to question the enemy fully reflects the steadfast and tenacious fighting spirit of the Asian-African and revolutionary peoples of the world.

The statement calls on revolutionary journalists in Asia, Africa, and the world to take action, using all propaganda means to thoroughly expose and resolutely stop the fascist crimes of the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong, and to strongly support the just struggle of Chinese journalists and people of all walks of life in Hong Kong against British fascist oppression.

    亚非记协书记处发表声明谴责港英迫害我记者的罪行
    英帝做尽坏事必遭灭亡
    新华社二十四日讯  亚非新闻工作者协会书记处二十三日发表声明，强烈谴责英国政府和香港英国当局迫害在香港的中国记者，破坏新闻采访自由的严重罪行。声明严正要求港英当局必须立即无条件地释放所有被无理逮捕的中国爱国记者。
    声明指出，港英当局迫害中国记者的这些事实表明，英帝国主义者对真理的传播怕得要死，已经最后暴露了所谓“新闻自由”的骗局，暴露了它的法西斯狰狞面目。
    声明说，英帝国主义的血腥暴行，不仅无法达到它延续其罪恶统治的目的，相反地，它只能是“搬起石头打自己的脚”。正如毛泽东主席所指出的：“帝国主义者的寿命不会很长了，因为他们尽做坏事”。亚非记协书记处深信：在香港的中国同行的正义斗争必胜，美英帝国主义及其苏修帮凶最终必将受到人民的无情审判，并遭灭亡。
    声明说，亚非记协书记处向受港英当局迫害的薛平先生和其他中国记者表示亲切的慰问，对他们在英国法西斯“法庭”上开展的大无畏的斗争表示坚决支持和高度钦佩。这种把敌人“法庭”变成责问敌人讲坛的英勇行为，充分反映了亚非和世界革命人民坚定、顽强的斗争精神。
    声明号召亚非和全世界革命的新闻工作者行动起来，运用一切宣传手段，彻底揭露和坚决制止英国政府和港英当局的法西斯罪行，大力声援在香港的中国记者和各界居民反对英国法西斯压迫的正义斗争。
