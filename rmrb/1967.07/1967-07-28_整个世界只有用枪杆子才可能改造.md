The counter-revolutionary revisionist film "The Enemy at the Gate," directed by the "patriarch" of revisionist literature, Zhou Yang, and released in 1964 for National Day, is a poisonous weed aimed at abolishing the revolutionary gun.

When this reactionary film was released, it was precisely the time when modern revisionists were most fervently chanting the "peace scripture," vehemently opposing the "path of war," and advocating "U.S.-Soviet cooperation," "world peace," and "human love." Khrushchev of the Soviet Union, during his visit to the United States, eagerly peddled the idea of complete disarmament, the "three harmonies" line, and a "three-no" world. The Chinese Khrushchev, during his visit to Indonesia, also desperately peddled the idea of abolishing the gun and taking the parliamentary road.

The master acts, and the servant cannot be lazy. Zhou Yang and his ilk, wielding their black pens, followed closely behind the two Khrushchevs, stepping in unison, and produced the reactionary film "The Enemy at the Gate," which advocates human love and abolishes the gun.

Zhou Yang has long proclaimed that the task of literature and art is to "struggle" to "eliminate all conditions that hinder mutual love between people." Now, let us take "The Enemy at the Gate" as an example to see how Zhou Yang and his masters use the literary and artistic front they have monopolized to struggle for the so-called "human love" and to "eliminate" the gun.

From the beginning of the film, they imitate Khrushchev's tone and loudly proclaim that the enemy is very "stable," and that people's wars and the power of the gun are of no use against it. Look, my troops are approaching the isolated city from all sides, and the enemy forces besieged in the city are still so arrogant and boisterous. In the midst of our army's thunderous cannon fire, they calmly hold a banquet to celebrate a birthday and host a Mid-Autumn dance party. The head of the miscellaneous troops, Zhao Chongwu, says, "When two tigers fight, the outcome is uncertain"; the female spy "Mrs. Qian" even boasts, "They fight their battle, and we dance ours!" Didn't Khrushchev "teach" us not to "test the stability of the capitalist system with force"? Zhou Yang and his ilk are singing the same tune here.

They also threaten that against armed enemies, one must not resort to arms, otherwise, "if we attack hard," the "lives and property of tens of millions of people in the city" will be "unprotected," and "complete sets of industrial equipment and powerful hydroelectric stations" will be "completely destroyed." The world will be plunged into "total darkness," there will be a "great flood," and there will be "heaven's wrath and people's resentment." In short, the gun is simply the root of all evil. The fallacies spread by the film are remarkably similar to Khrushchev's claim that if we engage in armed struggle, "we will destroy our Noah's Ark—the Earth."

They not only use their black pens to "eliminate" the gun but also use "artistic images" to tell people that as long as they "yield and compromise," "kneel and surrender," the armed bourgeoisie and landlords will "love each other mutually." Look, "Director Jiang" betrays principles, befriends the enemy, sends his son to the enemy, and is humble and submissive, reciting poetry and reminiscing with the executioner. He has such good "cultivation." In this way, he "moved" the armed enemy, and the problem was "peacefully resolved." Director Jiang's servile appearance is exactly like the traitorous faces of the two Khrushchevs who advocate the line of capitulation and betray the interests of the revolutionary people of the world.

To find a "theoretical basis" for the traitorous actions, Khrushchev of the Soviet Union said: the head of American imperialism has become "wise"; the Chinese Khrushchev said: "There are also some clear-headed people within the American ruling class." The film "The Enemy at the Gate" created two artistic specimens of "clear-headed" and "wise" people based on the master's fallacies. Look, the bandit commander not only "treats his brothers well" but also "loves the people like his children," preferring to go hungry rather than taking a single grain from the common people. He is a "good person" who "accumulates great virtues," a "patriot" who "worries about the country and the times." Can one use the gun against such a person? Thus, the film seizes the opportunity to pour out ink advocating bourgeois humanism, such as "humiliation of the wife," "sending the son," "old friend's private friendship," and so on, making the executioner who has been anti-communist for decades automatically "lay down the butcher's knife and become a Buddha." At the end of the film, the screen once again shows Director Jiang and the bandit commander shaking hands tightly. Without firing a single shot, two fundamentally opposed classes and two armies of completely opposite natures become mutually loving and unite as one. It seems that the victory of the War of Liberation was achieved in this way.

This method of distorting art is truly despicable! Who does not know that the victory of the Chinese people is the victory of armed struggle under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought. Zhou Yang, under the orders of the Chinese Khrushchev, actually directed the release of this poisonous weed "The Enemy at the Gate" during the 15th anniversary of the founding of our great motherland, attempting to attribute the victory fruits that the Chinese people won under the leadership of Chairman Mao with the gun to the merit book of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the party. This is to deceive the Chinese people and the people of the world, defame the role of the gun, and is truly shameless!

Zhou Yang and his master, the Chinese Khrushchev, take "eliminating" the revolutionary gun as their goal and use literature and art to struggle for their so-called "mutual love" with American imperialism and reactionaries of various countries. Their struggle is indeed meticulously planned.

"All reactionary things, if you do not beat them, they will not fall." In the past, Chiang Kai-shek did not stop launching a civil war just because the biggest "Director Jiang-style" capitulationist within the party at that time was dreaming of a "new stage of peace and democracy"; now, the ferocious American imperialism and its running dogs have not become beautiful angels just because the Khrushchevs at home and abroad are singing "human love" to it. At the very moment when Khrushchev of the Soviet Union and the head of American imperialism were embracing and kissing, many revolutionary people in Asia, Africa, and Latin America were shedding blood under the gun of American imperialism; after the Chinese Khrushchev chanted the "peace scripture" to the Indonesian reactionaries, tens of thousands of excellent sons and daughters of the Indonesian people paid with their lives under the butcher's knife. The bloody facts expose the shameless lies of "human love" written by the black pens of the Khrushchevs at home and abroad and their lackeys like Zhou Yang. The Khrushchevs at home and abroad and their lackeys like Zhou Yang sing these clichés to help American imperialism and reactionaries of various countries deceive the guns out of the hands of revolutionary people, so that they can boldly raise the counter-revolutionary guns to massacre the revolutionary people!

The bloody lessons teach revolutionary people: "Without armed struggle, there is no position for the proletariat, no position for the people, no position for the Communist Party, and no victory for the revolution." To win the victory of the revolution, one must take up the revolutionary gun; to consolidate the victory of the revolution, one must also hold the gun tightly! One must not place the hope of victory on the "wisdom" of imperialism and its running dogs.

Today, while thoroughly purging the poison of the big weed "The Enemy at the Gate," and launching a general offensive against the bourgeois capitulationist fallacies spread by the Chinese Khrushchev, we are excited to see that, under the boundless rays of Mao Zedong Thought, in Indonesia, Burma, India, Malaysia, in Africa, and Latin America, revolutionary people are taking up arms and using guns to eliminate imperialism and its running dogs and transform the world. Let us hold the gun tightly and once again learn from the great teacher of the people of the world, Chairman Mao: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," "The working class and the laboring masses can only defeat the armed bourgeoisie and landlords with the force of the gun; ... the whole world can only be transformed with the gun."

### “整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造”

    “整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造”
    中国人民解放军某部战士　程继尧
    反革命修正主义文艺的“祖师爷”周扬指令在一九六四年国庆节上映的电影《兵临城下》，是一株妄图取消革命的枪杆子的大毒草。
    这部反动影片出笼之时，正是现代修正主义者大念“和平经”，大反“战争道”，鼓吹什么“美苏合作”、“世界和平”、“人类亲爱”最最狂热的时候。苏联的赫鲁晓夫在访问美国时，竭力贩卖不要枪杆子的“彻底裁军”“三和路线”“三无世界”；中国的赫鲁晓夫出访印尼，也拚命兜售取消枪杆子的“议会道路”。
    主子身体力行，奴才岂能怠慢。周扬之流扛着黑笔杆，亦步亦趋，紧跟在两个赫鲁晓夫后面，抛出了宣扬“人类亲爱”，不要枪杆子的反动影片《兵临城下》。
    周扬早就宣称：文艺的任务，就是“为废绝一切妨碍人与人互相亲爱的条件”而“奋斗”。现在我们就以《兵临城下》为例，看看周扬和他的主子是怎样利用被他们霸占的文艺阵地，为“废绝”枪杆子，实行所谓“人类亲爱”而奋斗的。
    影片一开始，他们就学着赫鲁晓夫的腔调，大肆宣扬敌人很“稳固”，什么人民战争、枪杆子的威力，对它都毫无用处。你瞧，我几路大军逼近孤城，久困于孤城的敌军依然那样跋扈嚣张，在我军隆隆的炮声中，他们泰然自若地设宴祝寿，举行中秋舞会。杂牌军头头赵崇武说什么：“两虎相争，胜负未定”；那个女特务“钱太太”更是狂妄地叫嚷：“他打他的，我们跳（舞）我们的！”赫鲁晓夫不是“教训”我们不要“用武力去试试资本主义制度的稳固性”吗？周扬之流在这里唱的就是这个调子。
    他们还吓唬人说：对拿枪的敌人，千万不能动干戈，否则，“硬攻”起来，“城里几十万人民的生命财产”就“没有保证”，“成套的工业设备和强大的水电站”就要“彻底破坏”，天下就要“一片漆黑”，就要“闹一场大水灾”，就要“天怒人怨”……。总之，枪杆子简直是十恶不赦的祸根。影片散布的这些谬论和赫鲁晓夫说的一搞武装斗争，“我们将会毁灭自己的诺亚方舟——地球”，是何等相似呀！
    他们不但用黑笔杆“废绝”了枪杆子，而且又用“文艺形象”告诉人们：只要“委曲求全”、屈膝投降，武装的资产阶级和地主就会和你“互相亲爱”。看，那个“姜部长”出卖原则，认敌为友，送子上门，低三下四，和刽子手一起吟诗叙旧，“修养”多好。就这样，他“感动”了拿枪的敌人，问题就“和平解决”了。“姜部长”这副奴才相，跟推行投降主义路线、出卖世界革命人民利益的两个赫鲁晓夫的叛徒嘴脸，完全是一副模样。
    为了替叛徒行径寻找“理论根据”，苏联的赫鲁晓夫说：美帝国主义头子已经变得“明智”；中国的赫鲁晓夫讲：“美国统治集团内部也有一些头脑清醒的人。”影片《兵临城下》根据主子的谬论炮制了两个头脑“清醒”、“明智”的艺术标本。看，匪团长不仅“待弟兄们挺好”，而且“爱民如子”，宁肯饿肚子，也不动老百姓一颗粮食，是个“积大德”的“好人”、“忧国伤时”的志士，对这样的人还能动枪杆子么？于是，影片就乘机大洒资产阶级人性论的笔墨，什么“辱妻之恨”“送子之情”“旧友私交”……如此等等，就使反共反了几十年的大刽子手自动“放下屠刀，立地成佛”了。影片结束时，银幕上再次出现姜部长和匪师长紧紧握手的镜头，不费一枪一弹，两个根本对立的阶级，两支本质完全相反的军队，就互相亲爱，合二而一。似乎解放战争就是这样取得“胜利”的。
    这种颠倒黑白，歪曲历史的“艺术手法”真是卑劣极了！谁不知道，中国人民的胜利是毛泽东思想指导下武装斗争的胜利。周扬在中国赫鲁晓夫的指使下，竟然指令将《兵临城下》这株大毒草安排在我们伟大祖国建国十五周年的时候上映，妄图将中国人民在毛主席领导下用枪杆子夺得的胜利果实，记在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的功劳簿上，以欺骗中国人民和世界人民，诋毁枪杆子的作用，真是无耻之尤！
    周扬和他的主子中国赫鲁晓夫就是以“废绝”革命的枪杆子为目标，利用文艺为实行他们和美帝国主义、各国反动派的“互相亲爱”而奋斗的。他们这番“奋斗”实在是用心良苦。
    “凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”当年，蒋介石并没有因为当时党内最大的“姜部长”式的投降主义者发出“和平民主新阶段”的梦呓而停止发动内战；如今，凶恶成性的美帝国主义和它的走狗，也没有因为中外的赫鲁晓夫们向它高唱“人类亲爱”而变成美丽的天使。就在苏联的赫鲁晓夫和美帝国主义头子拥抱接吻之时，亚非拉许多革命人民在美帝国主义的枪口下流着血；就在中国的赫鲁晓夫向印尼反动派大念“和平经”之后，印尼人民几十万优秀儿女在刽子手的屠刀下，付出了生命。血写的事实揭穿了黑笔杆写的“人类亲爱”的无耻谎言。中外赫鲁晓夫和他们的奴才周扬之流高唱这些滥调，就是为了帮助美帝国主义和各国反动派骗下革命人民手里的枪杆子，好让他们放心地举起反革命的枪杆子屠杀革命人民！
    血的经验教训告诉革命人民：“离开了武装斗争，就没有无产阶级的地位，就没有人民的地位，就没有共产党的地位，就没有革命的胜利。”要想夺取革命的胜利，就应当拿起革命的枪杆子；要想巩固革命的胜利，也要握紧枪杆子！决不能把胜利的希望寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的“明智”上。
    今天，在彻底肃清大毒草《兵临城下》流毒的时候，在向中国的赫鲁晓夫散布的资产阶级投降主义反动谬论发动总攻击的时候，我们兴奋地看到，在光焰无际的毛泽东思想照耀下，在印尼、缅甸、印度、马来亚，在非洲、拉丁美洲，革命人民正在拿起武器，用枪杆子消灭帝国主义及其走狗，改造世界。让我们握紧枪杆子，再一次学习世界人民的伟大导师毛主席的教导：“枪杆子里面出政权”，“工人阶级和劳动群众，只有用枪杆子的力量才能战胜武装的资产阶级和地主；……整个世界只有用枪杆子才可能改造。”
