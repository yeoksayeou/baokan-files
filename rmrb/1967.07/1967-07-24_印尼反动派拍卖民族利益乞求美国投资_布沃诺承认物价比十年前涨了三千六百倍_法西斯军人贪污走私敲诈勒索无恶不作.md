The fascist military regime led by Suharto and Nasution in Indonesia has brought the economy into chaos. It is further colluding with American imperialism, auctioning off national interests, and desperately begging for investments from American monopoly capital groups.

According to the official mouthpiece Antara News Agency, Hamengku Buwono, the main minister of the Economic and Finance Department, admitted in a speech to the "Cooperative Parliament," a tool of the Indonesian fascist military regime, that "currently, prices are still very high! They are 3,600 times higher than the prices during 1957-58." He worried that "price increases will get worse in the future."

Buwono stated in his speech that the Indonesian fascist military regime is willing to sell out national interests and absorb large amounts of foreign capital led by American imperialism to achieve its "economic stabilization plan." He said, "The investment plans of foreign capital in Indonesia have a bright future. However, the government deeply feels that in the six months since the parliament passed the foreign investment law, there has not been enough time for the massive investments of foreign capital."

According to the Associated Press, Indonesian Ambassador to the United States Suwito Kusumowidjojo held talks with U.S. Assistant Secretary of State William Bundy and other high-ranking U.S. officials on the 6th, begging for American monopoly capital groups to invest in Indonesia. Suwito shamelessly said, "We hope American enterprises will come to Indonesia and fully utilize our new foreign investment law. In the past few months, (the U.S. and Indonesia) have held exploratory talks, which is a way for American investors to understand the situation. Now I hope they take more specific steps." Suwito also expressed his servile attitude, saying he would try to make American oil monopolies "interested" in further developing Indonesia's oil to solve the "oil shortage caused by the Middle East crisis."

The fascist military regime led by Suharto and Nasution in Indonesia is extremely corrupt, with extortion, bribery, and smuggling rampant. Even right-wing newspapers in Jakarta admit that the right-wing army in Indonesia is a "tool to disrupt the economy and make the people suffer."

According to a recent report by the Jakarta newspaper *Hope's Light*, officials of the Indonesian fascist military regime, both military and civilian, are all involved in extortion and bribery, with right-wing military personnel being the most rampant. The report states that these right-wing military personnel "use their uniforms and guns" to carry out extortion. "Usually, those who lead such activities are the officers, who do it directly or indirectly, openly or secretly." The report says that some right-wing officers "directly intervene in private enterprises, becoming big bankers or merchants." The report also states, "The Indonesian armed forces are involved in the business world, and they will not suffer losses because they have weapons and can impose their will. For example, in the trade of local products, they can buy rubber and copra at prices 20% lower than market prices." The report says, "Seeing the lowly qualities of the Indonesian armed forces, members of other institutions follow suit. Members of the customs, prosecution, judiciary, immigration, and other institutions, as well as church construction committees, are all involved in corruption. In disrupting the country's economy, banks are not lagging behind." The report says that many high-ranking Indonesian officials often abuse their power to embezzle and steal. They "can issue documents at will as long as they get the money."

Among the military and civilian officials of the Indonesian fascist military regime, smuggling is extremely rampant. According to reports, smugglers siphon off 40% of Indonesia's annual export income in foreign exchange. Due to smuggling, Sumatra Island alone loses over $100 million a year. According to a report by the *Washington Post* on June 25, many local military command centers in Indonesia openly defend military smuggling, saying that smuggling is to "maintain military morale and provide adequate social welfare for the military."

    印尼反动派拍卖民族利益乞求美国投资
    布沃诺承认物价比十年前涨了三千六百倍
    法西斯军人贪污走私敲诈勒索无恶不作
    据新华社讯　雅加达消息：以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权把经济搞得一片混乱，它正进一步勾结美帝国主义，拍卖民族利益，百般乞求美国垄断资本集团的“投资”。
    据官方喉舌安塔拉通讯社报道，经济和财政部组主要部长哈孟库·布沃诺十日在印尼法西斯军人政权的御用工具“合作国会”发表讲话时供认，“目前物价还是非常高！比起一九五七——五八年期间的物价高三千六百倍。”他担心，今后“物价增长会更坏”。
    布沃诺在讲话中表明，印尼法西斯军人政权甘愿出卖民族利益，大量吸收以美帝国主义为首的外国资本，来实现它的“经济稳定计划”。他说，“外国资本在印尼的投资计划有光明的前景。但是，政府深深体会到，在国会通过外国投资法的六个月里，没有为外国资本的巨额投资提供充分时间”。
    据美联社报道，印尼驻美国大使苏维托·库苏莫威达格多六日同美国助理国务卿威廉·邦迪以及美国其他高级官员举行会谈，乞求美国垄断资本集团到印尼去投资。苏维托无耻地说，“我们希望美国企业到印尼，充分利用我们的新的外国投资法。在过去几个月里，（美国和印尼）曾举行过探索性会谈，这是一种让美国投资人了解情况的做法。现在我希望他们采取比较具体的步骤。”苏维托还奴才相十足地表示，他将设法使美国的石油垄断公司对进一步开发印尼的石油“感到兴趣”，以便解决“由于中东危机所造成的缺油情况”。
    新华社讯　雅加达消息：以苏哈托—纳苏蒂安为首的印度尼西亚法西斯军人政权极端腐朽，敲诈勒索，贪污走私之风盛行。连雅加达右派报纸也承认，印尼右派军队是“扰乱经济，使人民受苦受难的工具”。
    据雅加达《希望之光报》最近报道，印尼法西斯军人政权的文武官员，无不进行敲诈勒索，其中以右派军人最为猖狂。消息说，这些右派军人“利用他们的服装和枪支”来进行敲诈勒索。“通常带头干这种勾当的恰恰是军官，他们直接地或间接地干，公开地或不公开地干”。消息说，有些右派军官“直接插手到私营企业方面，当大银行家或商人”。消息还说，“印尼武装部队投身于商业界，他们是不会吃亏的。因为他们拿着武器，可以强加于人。例如，在土产贸易方面，他们可以用比市场价格低百分之二十的价格购买树胶和椰干。”消息说，“看到印尼武装部队的这种低劣品质，其它机构的成员也跟着这样干。关税局、检察院、司法机构、移民厅和其它机构以至教堂建设委员会的成员都进行贪污。在扰乱我国的经济方面，银行也不甘落后。”消息说，许多印尼高级文官经常利用职权，贪污盗窃。他们“只要捞到钱，就随意签发证件”。
    在印尼法西斯军人政权的文武官员中，走私之风极为盛行。据报道，走私分子每年套取的外汇占印尼全年出口收入的百分之四十。由于走私，仅苏门答腊岛一年就损失一亿多美元。据美国《华盛顿邮报》六月二十五日报道，印尼许多地方军区司令部公然为军人走私进行辩解，说走私是为了“维持军队的士气和使军队得到充足的社会福利”。
