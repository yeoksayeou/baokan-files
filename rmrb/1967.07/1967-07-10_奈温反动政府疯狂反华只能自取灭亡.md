Just as U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership are once again stirring up an anti-China wave around the world, particularly in the vicinity of China, the Ne Win reactionary government in Burma, acting on the behest of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, has betrayed its promises and committed barbaric anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities. It has openly acted as a lackey of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, tearing off the facade of "Burma-China friendship" it once used to deceive people, and fully exposing the reactionary nature of this traitorous military dictatorship.

The Ne Win reactionary government's crimes are glaring, yet it still tries to evade responsibility through all sorts of deceit, which is utterly futile.

The Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Rangoon is a representative institution of a great socialist country and enjoys internationally recognized diplomatic privileges. Yet, you organized thousands of thugs to attack the embassy, vandalize and destroy it, set it on fire, loot, and commit murder. You even deployed armed forces to blockade and surround it. Such fascist atrocities could only be committed by those reactionaries who have completely lost confidence in their rule.

Chinese experts in Burma, sent there in accordance with agreements between China and Burma, were commissioned by the Chinese people to promote friendship between the peoples of China and Burma. They worked diligently with the Burmese people, making sincere efforts to help the Burmese people economically and technologically. Their internationalist spirit and hardworking, modest, and people-oriented work style have earned them the praise of the Burmese people. Yet, you subjected Chinese experts to brutal persecution, even attempting to assassinate them. Your heartless actions in killing friends who help the Burmese people are utterly despicable. Can the Burmese people tolerate such actions?

The vast majority of Chinese residents in Burma have long lived in harmony with the Burmese people, sharing joys and sorrows, and have made active contributions to the Burmese people's struggle for national independence. Yet, you have carried out arson, murder, and looting against them without restraint. Your actions are nothing but the most brazen banditry and unadulterated Nazi-style racial madness.

The right of Chinese personnel stationed abroad to propagate Mao Zedong Thought is sacred and inviolable. It is only natural for patriotic overseas Chinese to love the great leader Chairman Mao, study Chairman Mao's works, and wear Chairman Mao's badges. Yet, you are terrified by the sight of our compatriots wearing Chairman Mao's badges and use this as an excuse to stir up an anti-China and anti-Chinese frenzy. This only proves that you are a bunch of brutal cowards who fear the light of day.

The fundamental policy of the Ne Win clique is to rule by dictatorship, betray the nation, oppose communism, and oppose the people. This bunch of reactionary military warlords represents the interests of the Burmese landlord class and bureaucratic bourgeoisie, enforcing military dictatorship at home to suppress the people's armed revolution, and kowtowing to U.S. and British imperialism and the Soviet revisionist clique abroad, betraying national interests. At a time when international class struggle is intensifying and the revolutionary armed forces led by the Burmese Communist Party are growing stronger, it is no surprise that the Ne Win reactionary government is fiercely hostile to and frenziedly anti-China, a staunch supporter of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries. This is the inevitable law of class struggle.

The Ne Win clique is a bunch of fascist butchers who rose to power through suppression and massacre. As soon as they came to power in 1962, they carried out a bloody massacre of patriotic and progressive Burmese students, killing hundreds of young people in one go; then they launched a nationwide arrest campaign, throwing tens of thousands of patriotic and progressive individuals into prison. To maintain their reactionary rule, the Ne Win clique stripped the people of their most basic democratic rights, imposing naked military fascist dictatorship, turning the regions under their control into a white terror-ridden hell on earth.

The Ne Win clique is a bunch of insatiable vampires. Since coming to power, they have implemented ruthless policies of plunder in the economic sphere, exploiting and oppressing the vast Burmese working people to the bone, and seizing the medium and small-scale industries of the national bourgeoisie and petty bourgeoisie through so-called "nationalization." The reactionary policies of the Ne Win government have led to a serious economic crisis, causing rural bankruptcy, urban stagnation, and widespread misery, turning a country famous for its rice production into a famine-stricken land of hunger.

The Ne Win clique is the arch-criminal behind the counter-revolutionary civil war in Burma. Relying on imperialist aid, they have raised a reactionary army to brutally suppress the armed revolutionary struggle led by the Burmese Communist Party. This bunch of bloodthirsty reactionary warlords, driven by militarism, have launched frenzied "sweeps" against revolutionary armed forces, burning down hundreds of villages, turning many into concentration camps, and massacring tens of thousands of revolutionary people and communists.

The Ne Win clique is a bunch of imperialist lackeys and the biggest traitors of Burma. They have always colluded with U.S. and British imperialism, Japanese militarism, the Soviet revisionist clique, and the Tito clique, as well as the reactionaries of India, Israel, "Malaysia," and Indonesia, pursuing policies of betraying national interests. Especially in 1966, after Ne Win personally went to the United States to pay homage to the U.S. imperialist chief Johnson, their collusion with U.S. imperialism became even tighter. Johnson boasted of "common goals" and "shared interests" between the U.S. and Burma. The Soviet revisionists also eagerly supported the Ne Win reactionary government, repeatedly praising Ne Win's so-called "socialism." Now, the Ne Win reactionary government's frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese actions are aimed at currying favor with U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionists, completely selling out and kowtowing to them. The Ne Win reactionary government's shameful actions naturally receive applause from the U.S. and Soviet revisionists, which is no coincidence.

The Ne Win reactionary government hopes to incite racial sentiments and provoke ethnic conflicts between China and Burma to divert the Burmese people's growing discontent. This is sheer delusion. The friendship we speak of between China and Burma refers to the friendship between the peoples of the two countries. This is a revolutionary, combative, and fraternal friendship that no reactionary force can destroy. The Ne Win reactionary government's destruction of the friendship between the peoples of China and Burma makes it a common enemy of the peoples of both countries.

Now, the Ne Win reactionary government can only rely on its bloody butcher's knife to survive. It not only massacres the Burmese people on a large scale but also brutally massacres Chinese residents, thereby discarding the last remnants of its deception of the people and losing the meager political capital it once had. The Ne Win reactionary government's retrograde actions have aroused increasingly strong discontent and resistance from the various ethnic peoples of Burma.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrifying, but in reality, they are not so powerful. From a long-term point of view, it is not the reactionaries but the people who are really powerful." The Ne Win reactionary government's frenzied anti-China actions and intensified suppression of the Burmese people will only greatly promote the revolutionary consciousness of the Burmese people, making them further see that the Ne Win clique is the public enemy of the Burmese people.

The armed struggle led by Chairman De Zin Dan of the Burmese Communist Party represents the direction of Burma's historical development. Now, all the peoples of Burma who oppose imperialism, feudalism, dictatorship, and betrayal, and who want to be friends with socialist China, are uniting under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party to further fight the reactionary Ne Win government and overthrow it. The Burmese people will definitely overthrow this anti-communist, anti-people, and anti-revolutionary fascist regime and achieve complete liberation.

The Ne Win reactionary government will inevitably perish, and the Burmese people's democratic revolution will ultimately triumph! The great unity and combative friendship between the peoples of China and Burma will last forever!

### 奈温反动政府疯狂反华只能自取灭亡

　　奈温反动政府疯狂反华只能自取灭亡
    正当美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团在世界上，特别是在中国的周围再一次掀起反华浪潮的时候，缅甸奈温反动政府秉承美帝和苏修的意旨，背信弃义，一手制造了野蛮透顶的反华排华的法西斯暴行，对中缅两国人民犯下了滔天大罪。它公然充当美帝苏修的反华走卒，把过去用来骗人的“缅中友好”的幌子撕得精光，赤裸裸地暴露了这个卖国独裁的军阀政权的反动面目。
    奈温反动政府罪恶昭彰，还要百般狡赖，妄想逃脱罪责，这完全是枉费心机。
    中华人民共和国驻仰光大使馆，是一个伟大的社会主义国家的代表机构，它享有世界公认的外交特权。你们竟然组织上千暴徒，袭击大使馆，捣毁破坏，纵火抢劫，杀人行凶，并且出动武装部队封锁包围。这样的法西斯暴行，除了那些对自己的统治完全丧失信心的反动派，谁能干得出来？
    中国援缅专家，是根据中缅两国协议去缅甸的，是受了中国人民的委托，去促进中缅人民友好的。他们在缅甸，同人民群众一起，辛勤劳动，努力工作，满腔热情地从经济和科学技术方面，帮助缅甸人民。他们的国际主义精神和艰苦朴素、联系群众的工作作风，得到了缅甸人民的赞扬。而你们竟然对中国专家横施迫害，甚至加以刺杀。你们这样丧心病狂，杀害帮助缅甸人民的朋友，简直是不齿于人类的狗屎堆。缅甸人民能够容忍你们这样做吗？
    旅居缅甸的绝大多数华侨，长时期以来，同缅甸人民友好相处，同命运，共患难，对缅甸人民的民族独立事业作出过积极的贡献。而你们竟然对他们进行烧杀劫掠，无所不用其极。你们的所作所为，难道不是彻头彻尾的强盗行径，不折不扣的纳粹式的种族主义狂吗？
    中国的驻外人员宣传毛泽东思想，是神圣不可侵犯的权利。爱国华侨热爱伟大的领袖毛主席，学习毛主席著作，佩戴毛主席像章，是天经地义的。你们看到我们的侨胞佩戴毛主席的像章，就怕得要死，借此掀起反华排华的妖风狂潮。这恰恰证明你们是一伙残暴成性的懦夫，是怕见阳光的鬼蜮。
    奈温集团奉行的基本方针，是独裁、卖国、反共、反人民。这一伙反动军阀，代表缅甸地主阶级和官僚资产阶级的利益，对内实行军事独裁，镇压人民的武装革命，对外投靠美英帝国主义和苏修集团，出卖民族利益。在今天国际阶级斗争空前剧烈的时候，在缅共领导的革命武装日益发展壮大的时候，奈温反动政府，疯狂敌视坚决支持各国人民革命斗争的社会主义中国，猖狂反华，是毫不足奇的。这是阶级斗争的必然规律。
    奈温集团是靠镇压和屠杀人民起家的法西斯刽子手。它在一九六二年一上台，就对缅甸爱国进步学生进行血腥大屠杀，一次就残杀了上百的青年；接着又在全国发动了大逮捕，把成千上万的爱国进步人士投入监狱。奈温集团为了维护其反动统治，剥夺人民最起码的民主权利，实行赤裸裸的军事法西斯专政，把它所统治的地区，变成白色恐怖笼罩的人间地狱。
    奈温集团是一伙贪得无厌的吸血鬼。它上台以来，在经济方面实行残酷的掠夺政策，对缅甸广大的劳动人民进行敲骨吸髓的剥削和压榨，还通过所谓“国有化”兼并民族资产阶级和小资产阶级的中小工商业。奈温政府的反动政策，造成严重的经济危机，使得缅甸农村破产，城市萧条，民不聊生，把一个以盛产大米著称的国家变成为大闹粮荒的饥饿之乡。
    奈温集团是发动缅甸反革命内战的罪魁祸首。它依靠帝国主义的援助，豢养一支反动军队，疯狂镇压缅甸共产党领导的革命的武装斗争。这一伙嗜血成性的反动军阀，穷兵黩武，疯狂“扫荡”革命武装力量，烧毁了成百成千的村庄，把许多村庄变成了集中营，并且屠杀了成千上万的革命人民和共产党员。
    奈温集团是一伙帝国主义的代理人，是缅甸的最大的卖国贼。它一贯勾结美英帝国主义、日本军国主义、苏联修正主义和铁托集团，以及印度、以色列、“马来西亚”、印尼的反动派，实行出卖民族利益的政策。特别是一九六六年，奈温亲自去美国朝见美帝头子约翰逊以后，同美帝国主义的勾结更加紧密了。约翰逊叫嚷美缅“有共同的目标”，“利益一致”。苏联修正主义也竭力为奈温反动政府捧场，一再宣扬奈温实行的所谓“社会主义”。现在，奈温反动政府疯狂反华排华，就是为了讨好美帝国主义和苏修集团，彻底地卖身投靠。奈温反动政府的这种无耻行径，得到美帝和苏修的喝采，当然不是偶然的。
　　奈温反动政府指望煽动种族主义情绪，挑起中缅的民族冲突，转移缅甸人民对它们日益强烈的不满。这完全是痴心妄想。我们所说的中缅友好，指的是中缅两国人民之间的友谊。这种友谊，是革命的友谊，战斗的友谊，亲如骨肉的友谊。这是任何反动势力都破坏不了的。奈温反动政府破坏中缅人民的友谊，它就成为中缅两国人民共同的敌人。
    现在，奈温反动政府只能依靠它的血淋淋的屠刀过日子。它不仅大规模地屠杀缅甸人民，而且又野蛮地屠杀华侨，这就把它最后一点欺骗人民的东西抛弃了，把它过去捞到的一点点可怜的政治资本丢光了。奈温反动政府的倒行逆施，引起了缅甸各族人民越来越强烈的不满和反抗。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们说：“一切反动派的企图是想用屠杀的办法消灭革命，他们以为杀人越多革命就会越小。但是和这种反动的主观愿望相反，事实是反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近于灭亡。这是一条不可抗拒的法则。”
    奈温反动政府疯狂反华，加紧镇压缅甸人民，只会大大促进缅甸人民的革命觉悟，使他们进一步看清，奈温集团就是缅甸人民的公敌。
    以德钦丹东主席为首的缅甸共产党领导的武装斗争，代表着缅甸历史发展的方向。现在，缅甸一切反对帝国主义，反对封建主义，反对独裁卖国，要求同社会主义中国友好的各族人民，正在缅甸共产党的领导下，进一步团结起来，用革命的人民战争，大造奈温政府的反，革它的命。缅甸人民一定要把这样一个反共、反人民、反革命的法西斯政权打倒，争取彻底解放。
    奈温反动政府必将灭亡，缅甸人民民主革命必将取得最后胜利！中缅两国人民的伟大团结和战斗友谊万世长存！
