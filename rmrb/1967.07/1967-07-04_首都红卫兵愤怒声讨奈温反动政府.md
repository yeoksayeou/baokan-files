The seven hundred million Chinese people are not to be trifled with! The seven hundred million Chinese people are not to be provoked!

The capital's Red Guards furiously denounce the Ne Win reactionary government.

The Burmese Communist Party is a formidable revolutionary rebel faction. We must closely unite with them, hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and fight together. We resolutely support the Burmese people in their armed struggle under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party, and create great turmoil for the Ne Win reactionary government.

Xinhua News Agency, July 3rd: A "Capital Red Guards Strongly Protest Against the Fascist Atrocities of the Burmese Reactionary Government Meeting" and a protest march were held in Beijing this afternoon. Over ten million capital Red Guards and revolutionary artists from the capital's cultural circles, enraged by the fascist atrocities of the Burmese Ne Win reactionary government, participated in this grand meeting and march.

The anti-China atrocities manufactured by the Burmese reactionary government are currently spreading to some small and medium-sized cities in Burma. The capital's Red Guards and revolutionary artists, closely watching the developments, sternly warn the Burmese reactionary government: The seven hundred million Chinese people are not to be trifled with! The seven hundred million Chinese people are not to be provoked! The seven hundred million Chinese people keep their word! Those who oppose the seven hundred million Chinese people will have no good end! The Burmese government, if it persists, will play with fire and burn itself! The capital's Red Guards and revolutionary artists express their most resolute support for the stern position of our country's government, vowing to be a strong backing for our country's personnel and patriotic overseas Chinese in their struggle against violence.

Under the red flag of the sun, with righteous indignation in their hearts. The protest meeting held near Tiananmen Square was filled with revolutionary fervor. The portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao was prominently displayed in the center of the stage. On both sides of the stage, large banners with Chairman Mao's quotations read: "To create disorder, fail, create disorder again, fail again, until they perish—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will not deviate from this logic." "The world is progressing, the future is bright, and this historical trend cannot be changed by anyone. We should often propagate the progress of the world and the bright future to the people, so that the people build up confidence in victory."

Attending today's meeting were Guo Moruo, Guan Feng, Chen Boda, Han Nianlong, Geng Biao, Zhang Xueyi, Chu Tu-nan, Wang Weizhen, Ding Guoyi, Li Siguang, Zhu Kezhen, Wu Youxun, Yu Liqun, and others.

Leaders of the capital's universities and colleges' Red Guards, Nie Yuanzi, Qiao Guobin, and Han Aijin, attended the meeting.

Revolutionary artists from the cultural circles who participated in today's meeting included Jin Jingmai, Li Yingru, Shu Shijun, Lu Gongda, Liu Jucheng, Li Jiefu, Du Jinfang, Qian Haoliang, Li Lifang, Zhong Runliang, Liu Jingfang, and others.

Guo Yinggao, a Burmese expert working in Beijing, was invited to attend the meeting.

The meeting began with the majestic tune of "The East Is Red."

Guo Moruo first spoke at the meeting. He said, the frenzied anti-China actions of the Ne Win reactionary government are not accidental. They are driven by domestic and foreign policy needs. The Ne Win clique came to power through a military coup in 1962. Internally, they abandoned the democratic facade of the bourgeoisie, implementing military fascist dictatorship, ruthlessly exploiting the people, suppressing the masses, opposing revolution, and pursuing counter-revolutionary policies against the people and communism. Externally, they sell out their country for personal gain, aligning with the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists, engaging in anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, and serving as the U.S. imperialists' shameful lackeys. Thus, class struggle in Burma has become extremely fierce, and the contradictions between the Burmese people and U.S. imperialism and its lackeys have become extremely sharp. The economic crisis is worsening, people are suffering, and the broad laboring masses are in dire straits. Where there is oppression, there is resistance; the more severe the oppression, the more intense the resistance. Under the correct leadership of the Burmese Communist Party, the revolutionary people of Burma have bravely engaged in armed struggle, creating great turmoil for the Ne Win reactionary government, and have driven the Ne Win reactionary government into a state of panic and disarray.

Guo Moruo pointed out that the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution in our country is like thunder rolling, shaking the world. The roar of the Red Guards' "Rebellion is justified" echoes throughout the world and the universe. The invincible Mao Zedong Thought is rapidly entering the hearts of the world's people. The revolutionary flames of the Burmese people, under the east wind of China's proletarian cultural revolution, are burning more fiercely. The death knell of the Burmese reactionary government has sounded!

Guo Moruo said, we firmly support the stern statement of our country's government and foreign ministry, and sternly warn the Burmese authorities: The great Chinese people are not to be trifled with, and the iron wall of seven hundred million Chinese people is indestructible! You will find no way out from your evil anti-China schemes. Over the years, those who have eagerly engaged in anti-China activities are numerous. The U.S. and Soviet revisionists have joined forces to oppose China, but not a single hair on China has been harmed. The reactionary regimes of India and Indonesia, which have followed the U.S. and Soviet revisionists, have found that the more they oppose, the worse their days become, and now they have become political garbage despised by all.

Guo Moruo said, our great leader Chairman Mao said: "'Lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own foot,' is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some fools. The reactionaries of various countries are also such fools. The various persecutions they inflict on revolutionary people will ultimately only promote broader and more intense revolutions among the people." Ne Win reactionary government! The result of your frenzied anti-China actions will only be: flying into the fire, self-destruction. The Burmese people, under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party, will unleash an ever-greater revolutionary storm, break through all the nets of imperialism and its lackeys, rush towards liberation, and bury the Ne Win reactionary government completely!

He said, to our glorious comrades in the Burmese Communist Party who are fighting in blood and fire! You are formidable revolutionary rebels. For the liberation of your country, for anti-imperialism and anti-revisionism, for the communist cause, you have made outstanding contributions. We are closely related to you as class brothers. We must unite closely with you, hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, and bravely fight together, and win together!

He said, brave patriotic overseas Chinese! In this struggle against the fascist persecution of the Burmese reactionary government, you have united as one, fearing no violence, and shown the heroic spirit of the great Chinese people. You are not only good children of the motherland, but in the struggle against the savage brutality of the Burmese reactionary government, you will be tempered to be even stronger. Our great leader Chairman Mao is always concerned about you, the Red Guards are fully supporting you, and the seven hundred million people of the motherland vow to be your strong backing. No matter how great the risks ahead, we will resolutely fight with you.

Guo Moruo finally emphasized: The tide of history is unstoppable. China's proletarian cultural revolution will certainly achieve even greater victories. While the Ne Win reactionary government, this small group of "die-hard slaves of U.S. imperialism, will ultimately perish for U.S. imperialism." The friendship between the peoples of China and Burma will be consolidated and developed in the struggle! The revolution of the Burmese people will certainly achieve final victory!

Guo Yinggao, a Burmese expert working in Beijing, spoke amidst extremely enthusiastic applause. He said, I firmly support the statement of the People's Republic of China on June 29th. I am overjoyed to have the opportunity to stand by Chairman Mao, together with the revolutionary rebel comrades, to jointly condemn the Ne Win reactionary government. In strongly protesting against the heinous crimes of anti-China and anti-Chinese activities by the Burmese government, he emphasized: The fighting friendship between the peoples of China and Burma is indestructible.

Guo Yinggao revealed that why is the Ne Win reactionary government so frenziedly anti-China? Because it caters to the needs of U.S. imperialism and the Soviet revisionist leadership; because it is extremely afraid of the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, afraid of the one victory after another achieved by the proletarian cultural revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao, and afraid of China's ever-increasing prestige in the world. He said, soon after the Ne Win reactionary government came to power, it created the unprecedented massacre of a large number of students in Burmese history. The people have no democratic rights, and darkness covers all of Burma. The Ne Win reactionary government also cunningly formulated various economic policies, plundering the people's property, making Burma, known as the "land of rice without famine," face famine. The Burmese Communist Party and revolutionary people have been fighting against the Ne Win reactionary government for more than nineteen years. Today, this people's revolutionary struggle will bury the Ne Win reactionary government. In this international situation and the serious military, political, and economic crises at home, the Ne Win reactionary government, like a cornered dog, tries to shift the people's anger towards its fire to the Chinese compatriots, destroying the friendship between the peoples of Burma and China, and destroying the Burmese people's love for Chairman Mao. Ne Win reactionary government, listen: Your evil plot will never succeed, your end is near.

Guo Yinggao pointed out: The Ne Win government has never been good, but as the chairman of the Burmese Communist Party, Thakin Than Tun said: "Modern revisionists cover up the truth that the ruling bourgeoisie compromises with imperialism and feudalism, and put lipstick on the policies of the ruling class." The Soviet revisionist leadership and China's Khrushchev also use various means to put lipstick on Ne Win. Therefore, for the Burmese people to achieve revolutionary victory, they must not only oppose imperialism and reactionaries of various countries but also oppose modern revisionism. Chairman Mao teaches us: Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun. The Burmese Communist Party and revolutionary people who insist on armed struggle against the Ne Win reactionary government will certainly hoist high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carry out armed struggle to the end, until they seize power.

At the end of Guo Yinggao's speech, together with the more than ten million capital Red Guards and revolutionary artists, he opened the red "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and recited: "With firm resolve, fearing no sacrifice, overcoming all difficulties, and striving for victory."

The representative of the capital's Red Guards, Wei Yang, in his speech, furiously denounced the fascist atrocities of the Burmese reactionary government. He said, the Ne Win reactionary government and U.S. and Soviet revisionists are birds of a feather, fearing truth, fearing revolution, fearing the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought, fearing the unprecedented proletarian cultural revolution in our country. They are madly engaged in anti-China and anti-Chinese activities, killing our experts, and attacking our embassy. The Burmese Ne Win reactionary clique hates and fears the invincible Mao Zedong Thought to death. They dare not let our patriotic overseas Chinese wear the shining Mao badges. Tell you, this is impossible, a thousand times impossible, a million times impossible! Chairman Mao is the brightest red sun in the hearts of revolutionary people around the world. We will wear Mao's badges, and we will wear them for generations to come, letting the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought shine all over the world and illuminate the universe. Wei Yang finally warned the Burmese reactionary clique: We, the Red Guards of Chairman Mao, the revolutionary proletarian faction, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, have rebelled against the biggest group of capitalists within the party. Similarly, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we also dare to rebel against imperialism, Soviet modern revisionism, reactionaries of various countries, and you, Ne Win.

The representative of the returned overseas Chinese from Burma, Su Xiuyu, said in her speech at the meeting that the friendship between the peoples of China and Burma has a very long history. The vast overseas Chinese in Burma have long lived and fought together with the Burmese people. In the struggle against imperialism, colonialism, and for national independence, they have forged an unbreakable friendship with their blood and lives.

Su Xiuyu said, the Ne Win reactionary government fears that Chinese schools will spread Mao Zedong Thought through teaching and tries to stop the spread of Mao Zedong Thought by closing all Chinese schools. This is nothing but a pipe dream! The Burmese reactionary authorities can close our schools, but they can never close the red hearts of patriotic overseas Chinese who love their motherland and Chairman Mao.

She said, the proletarian cultural revolution that shakes the world has further inspired the struggle of patriotic overseas Chinese in Burma and has greatly inspired the armed struggle of the Burmese revolutionary people. Under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party, the Burmese revolutionary people have ignited even more intense revolutionary flames, burning the Ne Win government to the brink of collapse, making it panic-stricken. In this situation, the cunning Burmese reactionary clique, in search of a way out, tries to shift the people's anger towards their fire to the Chinese compatriots. This time, the shocking anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities are a planned, organized, and step-by-step plot by the Ne Win reactionary government.

She said, the stupid Ne Win government, like all reactionaries, is a paper tiger. They, like all reactionaries, think they can suppress the revolution by killing people. They think the more people they kill, the more they can suppress the revolution. But contrary to this reactionary subjective wish, the fact is that the more reactionaries kill people, the greater the revolutionary force becomes, and the closer the reactionaries come to destruction. The Ne Win government will certainly start by harming others and end by harming itself.

The meeting, amidst angry slogans, passed a "Protest Letter" read by Han Aijin, a leader of the capital's universities and colleges' Red Guards. The "Protest Letter" strongly denounced and protested against the extremely brutal anti-China fascist atrocities committed by the Burmese Ne Win reactionary government. (The full text of the "Protest Letter" will be published separately.)

Amidst the singing of "The Internationale" and "Sailing the Seas Depends on the Helmsman," the meeting ended in victory.

After the meeting, more than ten million capital Red Guards and revolutionary artists, carrying portraits of Chairman Mao, holding high red flags, and shouting slogans, surged to the front of the Burmese Embassy in China, holding a grand protest demonstration.

From Tiananmen Square to the Burmese Embassy in China, a distance of more than ten miles, the marching column was like a surging torrent, advancing forward. The heroic Red Guards, carrying the portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao, holding high red flags, walked at the forefront of the column, followed closely by the cultural revolution army of the capital's cultural circles. Along the way, the marching column continuously shouted thunderous slogans, reflecting the indignant and resolute determination of seven hundred million Chinese people to fight to the end against imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries. When the marching column arrived in front of the Burmese Embassy in China, the angry mood became even more intense. Thousands of fists were raised, and thousands of people shouted in unison: "Down with the Burmese Ne Win reactionary government!" "Avenge the martyrs!" "Blood debts must be repaid with blood!" One after another, Mao Zedong Thought propaganda cars drove to the embassy gate, broadcasting to the embassy, strongly protesting against the fascist anti-China and anti-Chinese atrocities of the Burmese government. One after another, protest letters were posted on the walls outside the embassy, sternly exposing the ugly faces of the Burmese reactionary clique. People continuously waved their arms and shouted: "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet revisionism!" "Down with the Burmese Ne Win reactionary government!" "All anti-China elements will meet a bad end!"

　　七亿中国人民不可侮！　七亿中国人民不好惹！
　　首都红卫兵愤怒声讨奈温反动政府
    缅共是响当当的革命造反派。我们要和他们紧密团结，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗战斗在一起。我们坚决支持缅甸人民在缅共领导下进行武装斗争，大造奈温反动政府的反。
    新华社三日讯　北京今天下午举行“首都红卫兵强烈抗议缅甸反动政府反华暴行大会”，并举行示威游行。被缅甸奈温反动政府法西斯暴行激怒了的首都红卫兵和首都文艺界无产阶级革命派战士十多万人，参加了这一声势浩大的大会和游行。
    缅甸反动政府一手制造的反华暴行，目前正在向缅甸的一些中小城镇蔓延。密切注视着事态发展的首都红卫兵和革命文艺战士，严正警告缅甸反动政府：七亿中国人民不可侮！七亿中国人民是不好惹的！七亿中国人民说话是算数的！同七亿中国人民为敌决没有好下场！缅甸政府一意孤行，必将玩火自焚！首都红卫兵和革命文艺战士表示最坚决地拥护我国政府的严正立场，誓作坚持抗暴斗争的我国驻缅人员和爱国侨胞的强大后盾。
    日照大旗红似火，胸怀义愤志如钢。在天安门附近广场举行的抗议大会，充满了战斗的革命豪情。伟大领袖毛主席的画像高挂在大会主席台正中。主席台两旁的巨幅毛主席语录写着：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”“世界是在进步的，前途是光明的，这个历史的总趋势任何人也改变不了。我们应当把世界进步的情况和光明的前途，常常向人民宣传，使人民建立起胜利的信心。”
    出席今天大会的有，郭沫若、关锋、戚本禹、韩念龙、耿飚、张奚若、楚图南、王唯真、丁国钰、李四光、竺可桢、吴有训、于立群等。
    首都大专院校红代会负责人聂元梓、蒯大富、韩爱晶出席了大会。
    参加今天大会的文艺界无产阶级革命派战士有：金敬迈、李英儒、舒世俊、陆公达、刘巨成、李劫夫、杜近芳、钱浩梁、李丽芳、钟润良、刘景芳等。
    在北京工作的缅甸专家郭迎高应邀出席了大会。
    大会在雄壮的《东方红》乐曲声中开始。
    郭沫若同志首先在大会上讲话。他说，奈温反动政府的疯狂反华，绝不是偶然的。那是出于内政外交上的需要。奈温集团是在一九六二年靠军事政变上台的。对内，它抛弃了资产阶级民主的遮羞布，实行军事的法西斯独裁，残酷地剥削人民，镇压群众，反对革命，推行反共反人民的反革命政策；对外，它卖国求荣，投靠美帝、苏修，大搞反华、排华活动，充当美帝可耻的走卒。这样，缅甸国内阶级斗争空前激烈，缅甸人民同美帝国主义及其走卒的矛盾空前尖锐化。经济危机日益加剧，民不聊生，广大劳动人民处在水深火热之中。有压迫，就有反抗；压迫愈甚，反抗也就愈烈。缅甸的革命人民在缅甸共产党的正确领导下，进行了英勇的武装斗争，大造奈温反动政府的反，把奈温反动政府打得焦头烂额，狼狈不堪。
    郭沫若指出，我国史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命象春雷滚动，震撼着全球。红卫兵小将“造反有理”的吼声响彻全世界全宇宙，战无不胜的毛泽东思想迅速地注入世界人民的心田，缅甸人民的革命烽火，在中国无产阶级文化大革命的东风鼓动下，越烧越旺，缅甸反动政府的丧钟敲响了！
    郭沫若说，我们坚决拥护我国政府和外交部的严正声明，并严正警告缅甸当局：伟大的中国人民是不可侮的，七亿中国人民的铜墙铁壁是坚不可摧的！你们从反华的罪恶勾当中是找不到任何出路的。几年来，热心反华的英雄好汉可谓多矣，美帝苏修联合起来反华，也没有损伤中国的一根毫毛。追随美帝和苏修的印度和印尼反动派，反来反去，日子越来越不好过，如今已经成了人们所唾弃的政治垃圾。
    郭沫若说，我们伟大的领袖毛主席说过：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。”奈温反动政府！你们疯狂反华的结果只能是：飞蛾扑火，自取灭亡。缅甸人民将在缅甸共产党的领导下，掀起愈来愈大的革命风暴，冲决帝国主义及其走狗的一切罗网，向着解放的路上飞跑，把奈温反动政府彻底埋葬！
    他说，正在浴血奋战的缅甸共产党的光荣战友们！你们是响当当的革命造反派，你们为着祖国的解放，为着反帝、反修，为着共产主义事业作出了卓越的贡献，我们和你们是休戚相关的阶级兄弟，我们要和你们紧密地团结在一起，高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，勇敢地战斗在一起，胜利在一起！
    他说，英勇的爱国侨胞们！在这场反对缅甸反动政府的法西斯迫害的斗争中，你们团结一致，不畏强暴，表现了伟大的中国人民的英雄气概。你们不但是祖国的好儿女，你们在反对缅甸反动政府的野蛮兽行的斗争中，会锻炼得愈来愈坚强。伟大的领袖毛主席时刻在关怀你们，红卫兵小将在全力支持你们，祖国的七亿人民誓作你们的坚强后盾，不管前面有多大风险，我们都坚决和你们战斗在一起。
    郭沫若最后强调说：历史的潮流是谁也阻挡不了的，中国的无产阶级文化大革命一定取得更加辉煌的胜利。而奈温反动政府这一小撮“死心塌地让美帝国主义牵着鼻子走的奴才，到头来只能为美帝国主义殉葬。”中缅两国人民的友谊必将在战斗中巩固和发展！缅甸人民的革命必将取得最后胜利！
    在京工作的缅甸专家郭迎高，在极其热烈的掌声中讲话。他说，我坚决拥护中华人民共和国政府六月二十九日的声明。我为有机会在毛主席身边，同革命造反派的同志们一起，共同谴责奈温反动政府而感到无比高兴。他在强烈抗议缅甸政府反华排华的滔天罪行时，强调地指出：中缅两国人民的战斗友谊是无论如何也破坏不了的。
    郭迎高揭露说，奈温反动政府为什么要猖狂反华呢？因为它要迎合美帝国主义和苏联修正主义领导集团的需要；因为它非常害怕光焰无际的毛泽东思想，害怕毛主席亲自发动和领导的无产阶级文化大革命所取得的一个又一个的胜利，害怕中国在世界上享有的日益崇高的威望。他说，奈温反动政府上台不久，就制造了缅甸历史上前所未有的屠杀大批学生的事件，人民毫无民主权利，黑暗笼罩着全缅甸。奈温反动政府还狡猾地制定各种经济政策，大肆掠夺人民的财产，使缅甸这个号称“没有饿殍”的大米之乡面临着饥荒。缅甸共产党和革命人民，为反对奈温反动政府而进行的武装斗争，已经持续了十九年以上。今天，这个人民革命斗争，即将埋葬奈温反动政府。奈温反动政府在这种国际形势和国内严重的军事、政治和经济危机的情况下，狗急跳墙，企图把人民群众烧向它的烈火转移到中国同胞的身上，破坏缅中两国人民的友谊，破坏缅甸人民对毛主席的热爱。奈温反动政府听着：你的这一罪恶阴谋绝不会得逞，你的末日到了。
    郭迎高指出：奈温政府从来不是好东西，但是正如缅甸共产党主席德钦丹东所说的：“现代修正主义者掩盖当权的资产阶级向帝国主义和封建主义妥协的真相，给统治阶级的纲领涂脂抹粉”，苏修领导集团和中国的赫鲁晓夫也用种种办法为奈温涂脂抹粉。因此，缅甸人民要取得革命的胜利，不仅要反对帝国主义和各国反动派，而且要反对现代修正主义。毛主席教导我们：枪杆子里面出政权。为反对奈温反动政府而坚持武装斗争的缅甸共产党和革命人民，一定高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把武装斗争进行到底，直至夺取政权。
    郭迎高讲话末了，同全场十多万首都红卫兵和革命文艺战士一道，翻开红彤彤的《毛主席语录》朗诵道：“下定决心，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利。”
    首都红卫兵代表魏阳在讲话中愤怒声讨缅甸反动政府的法西斯暴行。他说，奈温反动政府和美帝苏修是一丘之貉，害怕真理，害怕革命，害怕光焰无际的毛泽东思想，害怕史无前例的我国无产阶级文化大革命。他们丧心病狂地进行排华反华，杀害我专家，袭击我大使馆。缅甸奈温反动派对战无不胜的毛泽东思想恨得要死，怕得要命，竟然不让我爱国侨胞佩戴金光闪闪的毛主席像章。告诉你们，这办不到，一千个办不到，一万个办不到！毛主席是世界革命人民心中最红最红的红太阳，头可断，血可流，毛泽东思想决不丢！我们就是要戴毛主席的像章，就是要千秋万代子子孙孙的戴下去，让毛泽东思想伟大红旗插遍全世界，照亮全宇宙。魏阳最后警告缅甸反动派：我们毛主席的红卫兵，无产阶级革命派，在毛泽东思想的指引下，造了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反，造了资产阶级反动路线的反。同样，我们在毛泽东思想的指引下，也敢于造帝国主义的反，造苏联现代修正主义的反，造各国反动派的反，造你奈温的反。
    缅甸归国华侨代表粟秀玉在大会上讲话说，中缅两国人民的友谊是有极其悠久的历史的。在缅甸的广大华侨，长期以来同缅甸人民生活在一起，战斗在一起。在反帝、反殖、争取民族独立的斗争中，用鲜血和生命结成了牢不可破的友谊。
    粟秀玉说，奈温反动政府害怕华侨学校通过教学传播毛泽东思想，妄想用封闭所有的华侨学校来阻止毛泽东思想的传播。这真是白日做梦！缅甸反动当局能封闭我们的学校，但永远也封闭不了爱国华侨热爱祖国、热爱毛主席的红心。
    她说，震撼世界的我国无产阶级文化大革命，更加鼓舞了缅甸爱国华侨的斗争，也极大地鼓舞了缅甸革命人民的武装斗争。缅甸革命人民在缅甸共产党的领导下，燃起了更加猛烈的革命火焰，烧得奈温政府摇摇欲坠，惶惶不可终日。在这种情况下，老奸巨猾的缅甸反动派为了寻找出路，企图把人民群众烧向他们的怒火，转移到中国同胞的身上。这一次骇人听闻的反华排华暴行，是奈温反动政府有计划有组织有步骤地制造策划的。
    她说，愚蠢的奈温政府和一切反动派一样都是纸老虎。他们和一切反动派一样，想用屠杀的方法消灭革命，他们以为杀人越多，就可以把革命镇压下去。但是和这种反动的主观愿望相反，事实是反动派杀人越多，革命的力量就越大，反动派就越接近灭亡。奈温政府必定是以损人开始，以害己告终。
    大会在愤怒的口号声中通过了由首都大专院校红代会负责人韩爱晶宣读的《抗议书》。《抗议书》最最强烈地声讨和抗议缅甸奈温反动政府制造的极端残暴的反华法西斯暴行。（《抗议书》全文另发）
    在《国际歌》和《大海航行靠舵手》的歌声中，大会胜利结束。
    会后，十多万首都红卫兵和革命文艺战士，抬着毛主席画像，高举红旗，高呼口号，涌到缅甸驻华使馆门前，举行了声势浩大的抗议示威。
    从天安门广场到缅甸驻华大使馆长达十多华里的路上，游行队伍象滚滚洪流，汹涌前进。英雄的红卫兵小将，抬着伟大领袖毛主席的画像，高擎着红旗，走在队伍的最前面，首都文艺界文化革命大军紧紧相接。沿途，游行队伍不断发出震天动地的口号声，反映出七亿中国人民怒不可遏的愤慨心情和誓与帝、修、反斗争到底的坚强决心。当游行队伍来到缅甸驻华大使馆门前时，愤怒的情绪更加沸腾起来，千万只拳头一齐挥动，千万人同声高呼：“打倒缅甸奈温反动政府！”“为死难的烈士报仇！”“血债要用血来还！”一辆又一辆毛泽东思想宣传车开到大使馆门口，对着大使馆广播，最最强烈抗议缅甸政府疯狂反华排华的法西斯暴行。一封又一封的抗议书贴在大使馆外面的墙上，义正词严地揭露缅甸反动派的丑恶嘴脸。人们还不断挥臂高呼：“打倒美帝！”“打倒苏修！”“打倒缅甸奈温反动政府！”“一切反华的人都没有好下场！”
