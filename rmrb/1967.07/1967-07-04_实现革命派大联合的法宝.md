In March of this year, we were sent to a certain factory to carry out the task of supporting the left. This factory had a workshop with five mass organizations. These five organizations did not recognize each other as revolutionary organizations and harbored serious antagonism. Therefore, instead of focusing on revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation within their unit, they were busy fighting "internal wars."

After arriving at the workshop, all five mass organizations reported the other's "situation" to us, demanding that the army support them and crush the other side. Through repeated and in-depth investigations, we learned that the five organizations had the same general direction of struggle and shared revolutionary aspirations. They were all revolutionary mass organizations. They also had varying degrees of shortcomings and errors in their work. The problem was that they saw themselves as all light and the others as all darkness, and they were unwilling to yield to each other. When dealing with issues, they always thought their own proposals were the most correct and demanded that other organizations listen to them. If other organizations disagreed, they would seize on the others' shortcomings and exaggerate them. In this way, they became entangled and unable to resolve minor issues.

How to correctly resolve the contradictions between revolutionary mass organizations, unify their thoughts, and march in step to concentrate their forces to strike at their common enemy? We brought this question to our study of Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People." Chairman Mao said: "All contradictions in the realm of ideas which are among the people, and all contradictions in the realm of ideas which are among the people, can only be resolved by democratic methods, by the method of discussion, criticism, and persuasion, and not by the method of compulsion or suppression." Chairman Mao's teachings made us realize that the contradictions between revolutionary mass organizations are issues of right and wrong among the people, and their fundamental interests are the same. Their most important common enemy is the capitalist roaders in power within the party, and their common desire is to fight these class enemies until they are thoroughly defeated. To correctly resolve the contradictions between these five organizations, we must not support one side and attack the other, nor can we act as "judges" to resolve contradictions, adopting a commandist attitude and coercive measures. Instead, we should help the masses to consciously grasp the weapons of criticism and self-criticism and resolve their internal contradictions themselves.

We first went to each revolutionary mass organization to study Chairman Mao's teachings on criticism and self-criticism, inspiring them to consciously revolutionize themselves, burn themselves, and carry out rectification activities. On this basis, we suggested that they hold debate meetings to clarify the direction of the struggle, discuss the harm of "internal wars" among the people, and emphasize the heavy responsibilities of the revolutionary factions. This helped each mass organization to further understand that our direction of struggle is to focus our attacks on the handful of capitalist roaders in power within the party and the capitalist roaders in power within our unit. Exposing, defaming, and overthrowing these most dangerous and primary enemies is a top priority for each revolutionary mass organization. Only by achieving a great alliance of revolutionaries and continuously expanding the ranks of the left can we accomplish this great and arduous task. Through a series of efforts, the masses of each organization raised their class consciousness and developed a common desire to achieve a great alliance of revolutionary forces. In the past, members of one organization would not speak to members of another organization when they met, but now they actively talk to each other and sincerely check their own shortcomings and errors with each other. Subsequently, the five revolutionary mass organizations in the entire workshop jointly held several "heart-to-heart" meetings. At the meetings, members of each organization used Chairman Mao's teachings on criticism and self-criticism as their weapons to openly check their own shortcomings and errors with each other. At the same time, they followed the principle of "unity-criticism-unity" and conducted mutual criticism with great enthusiasm.

Why did the revolutionary mass organizations develop disagreements and arguments into mutual opposition and attacks, affecting the direction of the struggle? We helped each revolutionary mass organization to study "Three Articles" and "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas" with this question in mind. Everyone found the root cause of the "internal wars" to be the "selfishness" in their minds. They deeply felt that in the past, they had directed their cannons at the wrong targets because their minds were blinded by the "selfishness," turning the other side's minor shortcomings into directional errors, and adopting a liberal attitude of magnifying small errors and minimizing big ones towards their own errors. Therefore, we must not only expose the "time bombs" buried within the party and government agencies, but also thoroughly eliminate the "time bombs" of "selfishness" in our own minds.

Through eight debate meetings and heart-to-heart meetings in the entire workshop, the contradictions between the five revolutionary mass organizations were finally resolved, and the "internal wars" stopped. In the common struggle of revolutionary criticism, the entire workshop achieved a great alliance of revolutionaries and pushed the revolutionary criticism and the struggle, criticism, and transformation within the unit to a new high.

### 实现革命派大联合的法宝

　　实现革命派大联合的法宝
　　沈阳部队某部副指导员　刘长发
    今年三月，我们到某工厂执行支左任务。这个工厂有一个车间共有五个群众组织。这五个群众组织互不承认别人是革命组织，存在着严重的对立情绪。因此，他们不是集中精力搞革命的大批判和本单位的斗、批、改，而是忙于打“内战”。
    我们来到车间以后，五个群众组织都向我们告对方的“状”，要求解放军支持自己，挤垮对方。经过反复深入的调查研究，我们了解到这五个组织的斗争大方向是一致的，革命愿望是共同的，都是革命的群众组织。他们在工作中也都有不同程度的缺点和错误。问题在于他们都是看自己一片光明，看对方一片漆黑，互相不服气。处理问题时，总觉得自己的主张最正确，要求别的组织都听自己的。别的组织不同意，就抓住人家的缺点不放，无限上“纲”。这样，就在一些枝节问题上纠缠不休，争执不下。
    怎样正确解决革命群众组织之间的矛盾，使他们思想统一，步伐一致，集中力量打击共同的敌人呢？我们带着这个问题学习了毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这篇光辉著作。毛主席说：“凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。”毛主席的教导，使我们认识到，革命群众组织之间的矛盾，是人民内部的是非问题，他们的根本利益是一致的，他们共同的最主要的敌人是党内走资本主义道路的当权派，他们的共同愿望是要把这些阶级敌人斗臭，斗垮，斗倒。要正确解决这五个组织之间的矛盾，我们决不能支持一方，打击一方，也决不能当解决矛盾的“裁判员”，采取命令主义态度和强制手段，而应该帮助群众自觉地掌握批评和自我批评的武器，自己解决自己内部的矛盾。
    我们首先分头和各个革命群众组织一起学习毛主席有关批评和自我批评的教导，启发他们自觉革命，引火烧身，开展整风活动。在这个基础上，我们又建议他们召开辩论会，通过辩论斗争的大方向，讲人民内部打“内战”的危害，摆革命派的重大责任，使各个群众组织进一步认清了我们的斗争大方向，就是要把矛头集中指向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和本单位的党内走资本主义道路的当权派。把这些最危险、最主要的敌人揪出来，斗臭，斗倒，是各个革命群众组织的一项头等重大的战斗任务。我们只有实现革命的大联合，不断壮大左派的队伍，才能完成这一伟大而艰巨的任务。通过一系列工作，各个组织的群众，提高了阶级觉悟，产生了实现革命派大联合的共同愿望。过去，这一个组织的群众同那一个组织的群众见了面不说话，现在主动地在一起谈心，诚恳地向对方检查自己的缺点错误。接着，全车间五个革命群众组织又联合召开了多次“交心会”。会上，各个组织的同志都以毛主席关于批评和自我批评的教导为武器，公开地向对方检查了自己的缺点、错误。同时，也按着“团结——批评——团结”的方针，满腔热情地进行了互相批评。
    革命群众组织之间产生分歧和争论，这本来是一种正常的现象，为什么会发展到互相对立，互相攻击，以至影响斗争的大方向呢？我们又帮助各个革命群众组织带着这个问题学习了“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》。大家找到了打“内战”的根源，就是头脑里的“私”字作怪。他们深有体会地说：我们过去所以把炮口对错了，就是让脑子里的“私”字蒙上了眼睛，把对方枝节的缺点当作方向性错误；对自己的错误缺点则采取大化小、小化了的自由主义态度。因此，我们既要挖出埋在党内和政府机构内的“定时炸弹”，也要把自己头脑里“私”字这个“定时炸弹”彻底挖掉。
    经过全车间的八次辩论会和交心会，这五个革命群众组织的矛盾终于解决了，“内战”停止了。在大批判的共同战斗中，全车间实现了革命的大联合；把革命的大批判和本单位的斗批改推向一个新的高潮。
