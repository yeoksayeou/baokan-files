The so-called "two kinds of educational systems" proposed by the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party is a thoroughly capitalist scheme. Yet, he arrogantly claims that it "is in accordance with Marx's words," and that "Lenin also spoke of this kind of school where one both studies and works, half-work and half-study." A small clique of revisionists also claim that this is "a development of Marxism-Leninism, with great international significance." It is truly astonishing how shameless they are!

The school system of "two kinds of educational systems" is not an "invention" or "creation" of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party. Rather, it is a replica of the "dual-track" educational system that existed in Western Europe during the Middle Ages. The "dual-track" educational system has been widely implemented in countries like Germany, England, and France for three to four hundred years. At that time, the ruling class divided schools into two categories: one called "commoner schools" and the other called "citizen schools." The former were schools to cultivate the ruled, to cultivate obedient slaves; the latter were schools to cultivate rulers, slave owners.

The "dual-track" educational system has obvious characteristics of a hierarchical system. Therefore, when Western European countries entered the capitalist society, the bourgeoisie, in order to conceal the essence of bourgeois education and deceive the broad masses of laboring people, had to change it into a so-called "unified" school educational system.

The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party shamelessly claims that his "two kinds of educational systems" are in accordance with Lenin's words. This is sheer nonsense. As early as 1897, Lenin, in his article "A Typical Example of Narodnik Utopianism," ruthlessly refuted the erroneous views of the Russian Narodnik Yushakov on educational reform. At that time, Yushakov proposed a plan to send the rich to one kind of school and the poor to another, with those who have money paying tuition and those who do not working to pay for it. Lenin pointed out sharply: Yushakov did not see participation in compulsory productive labor as a condition for the universal and comprehensive development of mankind, "but only as a means to pay for secondary school tuition." "Poor students serving labor duties—this is the foundation of Mr. Yushakov's entire plan."

Whether it is the "dual-track" system or the Russian Narodnik educational plan, both have long been thoroughly bankrupt. The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, however, brings these outdated and broken schemes to socialist China and crowns them with the title of "communist educational system." Is this not utterly absurd?

    “双轨制”的翻版，俄国民粹主义教育计划的再现
    起宏图
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的所谓“两种教育制度”，是一种地地道道的资本主义货色。但是他竟狂妄地说：它“是符合马克思的话的”，“列宁讲的也是这种又劳动又读书、半工半读的学校”。一小撮修正主义分子也说什么这是“马克思列宁主义的发展，是具有伟大国际意义的”，真不知天下还有羞耻事！
    “两种教育制度”的学校体制，并不是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的“发明”和“创造”，而是西欧中世纪早已存在过的“双轨制”教育体制的翻版。“双轨制”的学校教育体制，早在三、四百年以前，就在德、英、法等国广泛推行了。当时的统治阶级把学校分为两大类，一类叫“平民学校”，另一类叫“市民学校”。前一类是培养被统治者、培养驯服的奴隶的学校；后一类则是培养统治者、奴隶主的学校。
    “双轨制”的学校教育体制带有明显的等级制度的特征，因此，当西欧国家进入资本主义社会之后，资产阶级为了掩盖资产阶级教育的本质，欺骗广大劳动人民，也不得不把它改为所谓“统一的”学校教育体制。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派大言不惭地说，他的“两种教育制度”是符合列宁的话的。这完全是胡扯。远在一八九七年，列宁就在《民粹主义空想计划的典型》一文中无情地批驳了俄国民粹主义分子尤沙柯夫所谓改革教育的谬论。当时，尤沙柯夫提出了一个富人进一种学校、穷人进另一种学校，有钱就缴学费、没有钱就做工的所谓改革教育计划。列宁一针见血地指出：尤沙柯夫不是把参加义务生产劳动看作是人类普遍和全面发展的条件，“而只是为了付中学学费”。“穷学生服工役，——这是尤沙柯夫先生整个计划的基础。”
    无论是“双轨制”还是俄国民粹主义教育计划，都早已遭到了彻底的破产。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却把这些陈旧破烂搬到社会主义的中国来，并且给它加上一个“共产主义教育制度”的桂冠，这不是荒唐透顶的事吗？
