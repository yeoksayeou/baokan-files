Under the brilliant guidance of the great leader Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the masses in Wuhan who were deceived by the "Million Heroes" have awakened en masse and risen up in rebellion. The "Million Heroes" are rapidly collapsing. The deceived masses have turned against the enemy, angrily denouncing China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan, as well as the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line, completely breaking with the bourgeois reactionary line, and resolutely standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Their revolutionary actions have been warmly welcomed by the revolutionary masses and the revolutionary masses.

Facts have once again proven that Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is invincible and irresistible. The handful of bad elements who attempt to resist Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line with their despicable tactics of deceiving and misleading the masses are merely ants trying to shake a tree or grasshoppers trying to block a chariot!

The deceived masses are innocent. The responsibility lies entirely with the handful of power-holders within the Party and the army who are taking the capitalist road and deceiving and misleading them.

At this critical moment of the great struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines, the deceived masses must open their eyes, see the situation clearly, recognize the direction, and identify the enemy. They must see that the handful of power-holders within the Party and the army who are taking the capitalist road are more venomous than snakes and more ferocious than wolves. Once their plots succeed, our socialist country will change color, the working people will suffer, and the deceived masses will not be an exception.

Under the deception and misguidance of this handful of bad elements, the deceived masses have been tricked, misled, stood on the wrong side, lost their way, and deviated from Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. If they continue to follow them, they will go further and further astray and sink deeper and deeper. Being deceived is not a crime, but not being aware is dangerous. You must act decisively and quickly break with the handful of bad elements who have harmed you, completely break with them, and resolutely stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "If you make a mistake, you should correct it, and the sooner and more thoroughly you correct it, the better."

All deceived masses should listen to Chairman Mao's words and act according to Chairman Mao's instructions. If you make a mistake, you should correct it quickly, the sooner the better, the earlier the better. The revolution cannot wait, and rebellion cannot be delayed. The sooner you awaken, the sooner you can return to Chairman Mao's ranks. The sooner you rebel, the sooner you can do meritorious deeds for the people.

Turning against the enemy is a glorious revolutionary action of completely breaking with the bourgeois reactionary line and doing meritorious deeds for the people. All deceived masses should direct their spears at China's Khrushchev and his agents in Wuhan, and at the handful of bad leaders within the "Million Heroes" who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line. They should launch a fierce counterattack, expose their crimes, denounce their misdeeds, and thoroughly fight them down, fight them over, and fight them to stink!

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary masses, you should welcome and support all deceived masses in rising up in revolution and rebellion. You must actively, patiently, and meticulously do political and ideological work for them. You must not ridicule or mock them, and you must not retaliate against them. The more deceived class brothers you win over, the more revolutionary strength you will have. If you win over and unite all the deceived masses, the class enemies will be completely isolated and will be thoroughly finished.

Time waits for no man! All deceived masses should, with the spirit of "seizing the day," bravely stand up in revolution, stand up in rebellion, and with actual actions of turning against the enemy, resolutely and quickly stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and stand in the ranks of the proletarian revolutionary masses!

    再论受蒙蔽无罪，反戈一击有功
    在伟大领袖毛主席的无产阶级革命路线光辉照耀下，武汉地区“百万雄师”中受蒙蔽的群众，纷纷觉醒，起来造反。“百万雄师”正在迅速土崩瓦解。受蒙蔽的群众，回戈反击，愤怒控诉中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人和“百万雄师”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头，同资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂，坚决站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。他们的革命行动，受到无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的热烈欢迎。
    事实又一次证明，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，威力无穷，所向披靡。一小撮坏家伙妄图用欺骗蒙蔽群众的卑劣手段，来抗拒毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，只不过是蚍蜉撼树，螳臂挡车！
    受蒙蔽的群众是无罪的。罪责完全归于欺骗和蒙蔽他们的党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。
    在当前两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线大决战的关键时刻，受蒙蔽的群众，应当擦亮眼睛，认清形势，认清方向，认清敌人。必须看到，党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，他们比毒蛇还毒，比豺狼还狠，一旦他们的阴谋得逞，我们的社会主义国家就要改变颜色，劳动人民就要遭殃，受蒙蔽的群众也不例外。
    受蒙蔽的群众在这一小撮坏家伙的欺骗蒙蔽下，受了骗，上了当，站错了队，迷失了方向，背离了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线。如果继续跟着他们走下去，就会越走越远，越陷越深。受蒙蔽是无罪的，不觉悟是危险的。你们要当机立断，迅速同坑害你们的一小撮坏家伙，一刀两断，彻底决裂，坚决站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。
    毛主席教导我们：“犯了错误则要求改正，改正得越迅速，越彻底，越好。”
    一切受蒙蔽的群众，都应当听毛主席的话，按照毛主席的指示办事。犯了错误，就要赶快改，改得越快越好，改得越早越好。革命不能观望，造反不可迟疑。早一天觉悟，就能早一天回到毛主席的队伍中来。早一天造反，就能早一天为人民立功。
    反戈一击，就是为人民立功，就是同资产阶级反动路线彻底决裂的光荣的革命行动。一切受蒙蔽的群众，应当把矛头对准中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人，对准“百万雄师”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头，狠杀回马枪，揭露他们的罪恶，控诉他们的罪行，彻底把他们斗垮、斗倒、斗臭！
    无产阶级革命派的战友们，要欢迎和支持一切受蒙蔽的群众起来革命，起来造反。对受蒙蔽的群众，一定要积极地耐心地细致地做好政治思想工作。对他们决不要讽刺挖苦，决不要打击报复。多争取团结一个受蒙蔽的阶级弟兄，就多增加一分革命的力量。把所有受蒙蔽的群众争取团结过来，阶级敌人就会彻底孤立起来，就要彻底完蛋。
    机不可失！受蒙蔽的群众，都应当以“只争朝夕”的精神，勇敢地站起来革命，站起来造反，用反戈一击的实际行动，坚决地、迅速地站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来，站到无产阶级革命派的战斗行列中来！
