Our most, most beloved great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are aimed at seizing power, consolidating power." He also says: "We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." How to further strengthen the revolutionization of thought, eliminate all unreasonable institutions and bad influences left over from the past, and consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat, this is undoubtedly a serious task facing the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Shanxi Province after seizing power.

In the storm of the January Revolution, the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Shanxi Province and Xiyang County seized power from a handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Provincial Committee and County Committee. Due to work needs, I have taken on the positions of Deputy Director of the Provincial Revolutionary Committee, member of the core group, Deputy Director of the First-Line Command Department for Promoting Revolution and Production in the Province, and Director of the Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee, etc. This is the honor and trust given to me by the Party and the revolutionary masses, and I feel very happy. However, at the same time, I am also worried that after taking on these jobs, I will become detached from production, detached from the masses, and detached from reality.

My worry has its reasons.

Looking back at the years of the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation, many of our Party's leading cadres lived, labored, fought, and won together with the revolutionary masses every day. Everyone was closely related, shared hardships and joys, and was intimate. This was an important guarantee for us to defeat the enemy and win victory in the Anti-Japanese War and the War of Liberation under harsh conditions. After the liberation of the whole country, the status of some comrades, as well as the working environment and material conditions of the leading organs, changed greatly. Under these new circumstances, most leading comrades stood the test and maintained the character of proletarian revolutionaries.

Over the years, the Party branch of Dazhai has, in order to adhere to the only correct path indicated by Chairman Mao, self-reliantly build a new Dazhai, also taken many measures according to Chairman Mao's teachings to ensure that cadres can often participate in production labor and connect with the masses, making every person achieve what we call "five to": speak to, do to, see to, hear to, and learn to. Therefore, although our cultural level is not high and our abilities are not great, our relationship with the masses has always been close and mutually trusting. For example, the brigade leader Jia Chengran, who had a very low cultural level and could not even keep accounts, was elected by the masses to be the accountant for several years, and they said he was a "ten-thousand-pen clear." The reason is that he could maintain the character of a proletarian revolutionary, always living with the masses, and the masses believed that he would not put a single cent of the collective's money into his own pocket.

However, on the other hand, after the liberation of the whole country, there was a small number of people who began to stand aloof, become officials, and act like lords. Their thoughts and feelings, as well as their class stance, changed. They were detached from production labor for a long time, were idle, and knew nothing about production issues. Being detached from production labor for a long time also meant being detached from the masses, losing the trust of the masses. The masses did not want to report their problems to them, and they did not speak their minds to them. The wisdom and talents of the masses, they could not see or learn. When they encountered problems, they could not make decisions or find solutions. In this way, they actually lost their leadership over the masses long ago.

They "lost" the correct leadership, but wanted to continue to issue orders on the leadership post, then they would implement wrong leadership. If you let them lead daily work, they would talk empty words and fire blanks. If you let them command production, they would give blind orders and act recklessly, causing losses to the masses' production and life, and even leading socialist production and construction down the path of capitalist restoration. If you let them lead mass movements, they would implement bourgeois dictatorship over the broad revolutionary masses of the proletariat. In this way, it gradually evolved, becoming more and more intense, they were not only not the bridge for the Party to "concentrate from the masses and persist in the masses," but became the stumbling block for the Party to connect with the masses. In this proletarian cultural revolution, the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the former Shanxi Provincial Committee, former Jinzhong Regional Committee, and former Xiyang County Committee that we exposed, are the most prominent representatives of this type of person. The power of the proletarian revolutionary masses was seized from these people.

Now, the proletarian revolutionary masses of Shanxi Province have taken power, and many revolutionary pioneers who were once active on the front lines of industrial and agricultural production and learning positions have been elected into various levels of leadership organs and taken on leadership positions. The status and working environment of us have also changed. What should we do?

When I first took on my current position, I expressed my wish to other leading comrades: work must be done, but every possible measure must be taken to ensure that I can often participate in collective production labor and connect with the masses. Only in this way can I forever maintain the character of a laboring people and never change. I am glad that these leading comrades all agreed with my idea and supported me in doing so. Not only that, many leading comrades also had the same thoughts and plans as me. Therefore, after the establishment of the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee, while establishing revolutionary order, we also took some necessary measures to ensure that cadres can often participate in production labor and connect with the masses. For example, our Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee recently made the following regulations: cadres at all levels must fix a point of contact and also fix labor and work. The points where leading cadres at all levels squat are generally the communes and brigades with the most problems and the greatest difficulties. The time that cadres of county-level organs participate in production labor each year should not be less than sixty to eighty days, and the time for commune cadres should not be less than one hundred twenty to one hundred sixty days. In the past, during the busy farming season each year, the work of county-level organs was very leisurely, but now it is stipulated that during the busy farming season, the organs should close their doors, and all cadres should go out to participate in production labor and solve the problems that farmers urgently need to solve. In addition, in order to ensure that leading cadres do not have special treatment in life and material benefits and do not become detached from the masses, the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee, in addition to requiring everyone to consciously follow Chairman Mao's teachings, also plan to formulate some feasible methods to ensure this from the system.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We must insist on the system of cadres participating in collective production labor. Our Party and state cadres are ordinary laborers, not lords who sit on the heads of the people. Cadres, through participating in collective production labor, maintain the broadest, most frequent, and closest contact with the laboring people. This is a fundamental matter in the socialist system, which helps to overcome bureaucracy, prevent revisionism and dogmatism." We proletarian revolutionary masses who have taken power must often review Chairman Mao's teaching.

Over the past few months, with the support and assistance of comrades in the Shanxi Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the Xiyang County Revolutionary Committee, except for participating in some necessary meetings, I have spent most of my time living among the broad revolutionary masses and have tried to participate in some collective production labor. In this way, every time I go to the province or county to attend a meeting, I can bring the thoughts and opinions of the masses to the meeting, and when I return to the masses, I can also tell the masses the decisions of the leading organs. In the future, I will definitely not disappoint the expectations of Chairman Mao, the Central Committee of the Party, and the broad revolutionary masses, and do my best to do the work I am responsible for, continue to insist on participating in collective production labor, maintain close contact with the masses, and forever maintain the style of thrift and forever be a commoner.

　　永远艰苦朴素　永远当老百姓
　　山西省革命委员会副主任  昔阳县革命委员会主任  陈永贵
    我们最最敬爱的伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”又说：“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界。”如何进一步加强思想革命化，清除过去遗留下来的一切不合理的制度和坏影响，巩固无产阶级政权，这无例外地也是我们山西省无产阶级革命派在夺权后面临的一个严重任务。
    在“一月革命”风暴中，我们山西省和昔阳县的无产阶级革命派向省委和县委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派夺了权。由于工作的需要，我担任了省革命委员会的副主任、核心小组成员、省抓革命促生产第一线指挥部副主任，以及昔阳县革命委员会主任等职务。这是党和革命群众给我的光荣，对我的信任，我感到很高兴。但是，同时我也担心在担任了这些工作以后，脱离了生产、脱离了群众和脱离了实际。
    我的这种担心，是有原因的。
    回想在过去抗日战争和解放战争年代里，我们党的许许多多的领导干部，天天同革命群众生活在一起，劳动在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起，大家息息相关，患难与共，亲密无间。这是我们在艰苦的条件下，能打败敌人，取得抗日战争和解放战争胜利的一个重要保证。全国解放以后，一些同志的地位，以及领导机关的工作环境和物质条件发生了很大的变化。在这种新的情况下，多数领导同志经得起考验，保持了无产阶级革命家的本色。
    若干年来，我们大寨党支部为了坚持走毛主席指引的这条唯一正确的道路，自力更生地建设新大寨，也曾经根据毛主席的教导，采取过许多措施，保证干部能经常参加生产劳动，联系群众，使每一个人都做到我们所说的“五到”，即说到、做到、看到、听到、学到。因此，尽管我们文化水平不高，本事不大，但我们同群众的关系一向是亲密的，是相互信任的。比如，大队长贾承让同志，过去文化水平很低，一笔账也记不清楚，但是群众却硬是选他当了几年会计，还说他是个“万笔清”。原因就是他能保持无产阶级革命者的本色，永远和群众生活在一起，群众相信他是个不会把集体的一分钱放到自己口袋里的人。
    但是，另一方面，在全国解放以后，也有那么一小部分人，开始高高在上，做官当老爷，思想感情和阶级立场发生了变化。
    他们长期脱离生产劳动，四体不勤，对生产问题一窍不通。长期脱离生产劳动，同时也就脱离了群众，就失去了群众的信任。群众有问题不愿意向他们反映，心里有话不对他们讲。群众的聪明才智，他们也看不见，学不到。他们遇事拿不定主意，找不出解决的办法。这样，他们在实际上老早就失去了对于群众的领导权。
    他们“失去”了正确的领导，而又要继续在领导岗位上发号施令，那就要实行错误的领导。你让他领导日常工作，他就会说空话，放空炮。你让他指挥生产，就会瞎指挥、蛮干，给群众的生产和生活带来损失，甚至会把社会主义的生产建设引向资本主义复辟的邪路。你让他领导群众运动，他就会对广大无产阶级革命派实行资产阶级专政。这样逐渐演变下去，愈演愈烈，他们就不但不是党“从群众中集中起来，再到群众中坚持下去”的桥梁，反而是党联系群众的绊脚石。在这次无产阶级文化大革命中，被我们揪出来的旧山西省委、旧晋中地委和旧昔阳县委内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，就是这类人物中突出的代表。我们无产阶级革命派的权，就是从这些人手里夺来的。
    现在，我们山西省的无产阶级革命派，已经掌了权，许多原来活跃在工农业生产第一线和学习岗位上的革命闯将被选进各级领导机关，担任了领导职务。我们这些人的地位、工作环境也发生了变化。怎么办？
    在我开始担任现在的职务的时候，我就向其他一些领导同志表示了自己的愿望：工作要做，但必须想尽一切办法保证我能经常参加集体生产劳动，联系群众。这样，才能使我永远保持劳动人民的本色，永不变质。值得我高兴的是，这些领导同志都很赞成我的想法，支持我去这样做。不但如此，许多领导同志还有和我一样的想法和打算。因此，山西省革命委员会和昔阳县革命委员会成立以后，在建立革命秩序的同时，也在着手采取一些必要的措施，来保证干部能够经常参加生产劳动，经常联系群众。比如，我们昔阳县革命委员会最近就作了这样一些规定：各级干部，都要固定联系一个点，同时定劳动、定工作。各级领导干部蹲的点，一般都是问题最多、困难最大的社、队。县级机关的干部每年参加生产劳动的时间不能少于六十天到八十天，公社的干部不少于一百二十天到一百六十天。过去，每年农忙季节，县级机关的工作都很清闲，现在规定，农忙时，机关要关门，全体干部出去一面参加生产劳动，一面解决农民所急需解决的问题。此外，为了保证领导干部在生活和物质待遇上不特殊化，不脱离群众，山西省和昔阳县革命委员会除了要求大家自觉遵守毛主席的教导外，还要拟定一些可行的办法，从制度上加以保证。
    毛主席教导我们：“必须坚持干部参加集体生产劳动的制度。我们党和国家的干部是普通劳动者，而不是骑在人民头上的老爷。干部通过参加集体生产劳动，同劳动人民保持最广泛的、经常的、密切的联系。这是社会主义制度下一件带根本性的大事，它有助于克服官僚主义，防止修正主义和教条主义。”我们掌权的无产阶级革命派，要经常温习毛主席的这个教导。
    几个月来，在山西省和昔阳县革命委员会的同志赞助和支持下，除了参加一些必要的会议以外，我大部分时间仍然生活在广大革命群众当中，并且尽可能参加了一些集体生产劳动。这样，我每次到省里或县里开会，就有可能把群众的一些思想和意见带到会议上去，而在回到群众当中的时候，我也能把领导机关的决策告诉群众。今后，我一定不辜负毛主席、党中央和广大革命群众的期望，尽力把自己担负的工作做好，继续坚持参加集体生产劳动，密切联系群众，永远保持艰苦朴素的作风，永远当个老百姓。
