According to a report from the New China News Agency in Tirana on June 21, the Albanian newspaper "People's Voice" published an article titled "Soviet Revisionists - The International Fire Brigade of the Revolutionary and National Liberation Struggles of the Peoples of the World."

The article states that currently, the anti-American tide is surging across all continents. The fires of revolution and liberation are burning the American imperialists to ashes.

The article further points out that the Khrushchev revisionists have been and continue to be engaged in splittist activities within the communist movement in Latin America.

The Soviet revisionists are currently active in two directions in Latin America: on the one hand, they directly aid the reactionary bourgeoisie in power in South America to strengthen and consolidate their positions; on the other hand, they assist revisionist parties in suppressing the true Marxist-Leninist parties in Latin American countries and the revolutionaries and revolutionary movements.

The article points out that Soviet revisionism has taken the same reactionary stance and the same line of capitulation and pro-imperialism in Indonesia. Over a long period, they have slandered and defamed the Indonesian Communist Party, which has been fighting to defend Indonesia's freedom and independence and to prevent it from falling victim to neo-colonialism and foreign intervention. The Soviet revisionists even colluded with American imperialism and maintained friendly relations with the Suharto-Nasution fascist clique.

The article states that it is becoming increasingly clear from the Soviet revisionists' stance against the Vietnamese people's anti-American liberation struggle that they are playing the dirty role of a counter-revolutionary fire brigade. They use double-dealing tactics, pretending to be friends of the Vietnamese people and claiming to support the Vietnamese people. In reality, they sabotage the Vietnamese people's liberation struggle and try every means to make the Vietnamese people fail and surrender to the American imperialists. Their only hope and goal is to resolve the Vietnamese issue within the framework of Soviet-American cooperation to divide spheres of influence and for the two superpowers to dominate the world.

The article states that now, the Soviet revisionists are using various means to split the liberation movements in African countries, creating factions and advocating appeasement and capitulation to colonialism and imperialist forces.

The article states: The Khrushchev revisionists recently held the Karlovy Vary meeting. The line adopted at this meeting is one of cooperation and unity with the European big bourgeoisie, a line of keeping Europe quiet, so that imperialism and reactionaries can suppress the efforts and aspirations of the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America for national and social liberation.

The article states that now, the Soviet leaders are trying to bring the Arab-Israeli conflict issue to the United Nations for discussion. This is a new plot aimed at interfering in the highest interests of the Arab people together with American imperialism, making deals at the expense of the Arab people's interests, and extinguishing the Arab people's patriotism and spirit of resistance to foreign aggression.

The article states that the Soviet revisionists have launched vicious, chauvinistic, anti-Marxist, and anti-socialist attacks on the Party of Labour of Albania and the People's Republic of Albania, and on the Communist Party of China and the People's Republic of China. However, the Soviet revisionists' attacks on us, on the true revolutionaries and Marxist-Leninists, are desperate, hopeless, and without a future.

The article concludes by saying that the Soviet revisionists' shameful betrayal of the revolutionary and national liberation struggles of the peoples of the world is a great betrayal. Revolutionaries and all those fighting for the freedom and independence of their own countries will draw extremely valuable lessons from the betrayal and despicable deeds of the revisionists. They will not only expose the true face of the Soviet revisionists - friends of imperialism and enemies of revolution - but they will also firmly believe that in order to effectively resist imperialism, they must also resolutely and tenaciously resist the Soviet revisionists.

　　阿《人民之声报》揭露苏修充当国际“消防队”的丑恶行径
　　苏修是革命的死敌，美帝的帮凶
    据新华社地拉那一日电　阿尔巴尼亚《人民之声报》六月二十一日发表一篇题为《苏联修正主义者——各国人民革命和民族解放斗争的国际消防队》的文章。
    文章说，当前，各大洲的反美浪潮日益高涨。革命和解放斗争的烈火正在把美帝烧成灰烬。
    文章接着指出，赫鲁晓夫修正主义者过去和现在一直在拉丁美洲共产主义运动中进行分裂活动。
    苏联修正主义者现在在拉丁美洲的活动中朝着两个方面做工作：一方面，他们直接帮助在南美执政的反动资产阶级，以便加强和巩固它的阵地；另一方面，他们帮助修正主义党，伙同它们打击拉丁美洲真正的马克思列宁主义政党，打击拉丁美洲国家的革命者和革命。
    文章指出，苏联修正主义在印度尼西亚采取了同样的反动立场，同样的投降和亲帝国主义的路线。在漫长的时期中，他们对保卫印度尼西亚的自由与独立并为使之免遭新殖民主义和外国干涉之害而斗争的印度尼西亚共产党，大肆诋毁和诽谤。苏联修正主义甚至同美帝国主义合成一伙，同苏哈托—纳苏蒂安法西斯集团保持着亲切友好的关系。
    文章说，可以从苏联修正主义者反对越南人民的反美解放斗争的立场中，越来越清楚地看出他们所扮演的反革命消防队的肮脏角色。他们玩弄两面手法，假装成越南人民的朋友，装作声援越南人民。而在事实上，他们破坏越南人民的解放斗争，并且想方设法使越南人民遭到失败，使越南人民向美帝屈服。他们唯一的希望，唯一的目标，就是要把越南问题的解决纳入苏美合作以划分势力范围和两大国主宰世界这个框框之内。
    文章说，现在，苏联修正主义者竭力用各种手段分裂非洲各国的解放运动，制造分裂的派系，主张对殖民主义和帝国主义势力姑息投降。
    文章说：赫鲁晓夫修正主义者不久前举行了卡罗维发利会议。这次会议所制定的路线，是同欧洲大资产阶级合作和结成一体的路线，是使欧洲平静无事的路线，以便让帝国主义和反动派能放手镇压亚洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各国人民争取民族和社会解放的努力和愿望。
    文章说，现在，苏联领导人竭力把阿拉伯—以色列冲突问题提交给联合国讨论。这是一个新阴谋，目的在于同美帝国主义一起干预阿拉伯人民的最高利益，作牺牲阿拉伯人民利益的交易、扑灭阿拉伯人民抗击外国侵略的爱国主义和反抗精神。
    文章说，苏联修正主义者对阿尔巴尼亚劳动党和阿尔巴尼亚人民共和国，对中国共产党和中华人民共和国进行了阴险的、沙文主义的、反马克思主义的和反社会主义的攻击。但是，苏联修正主义者对我们、对真正的革命者和马克思列宁主义进行的攻击，是垂死的、没有希望的和没有出路的。
    文章最后说，苏联修正主义者对各国人民的革命和民族解放事业的可耻背叛，是一个大背叛。革命者，所有为自己国家的自由和独立而斗争的人们，定将从修正主义者的背叛和卑鄙行径中吸取十分宝贵的教益。他们不仅将揭露苏联修正主义者——帝国主义的朋友和革命的敌人的真面目，而且他们确信不疑，为了有效地抗击帝国主义、必须同样坚决和顽强地抗击苏联修正主义者。
