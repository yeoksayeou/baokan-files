The documentary film "Revolutionary Youth Most Obey Chairman Mao's Words" gave us a vivid lesson. Revolutionary comrades from Shanghai No. 6 Girls' Middle School, during the great criticism of the revolution, did not adopt a discriminatory or exclusionary attitude towards those who had been deceived. Instead, they pointed out that these individuals were also victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. They talked with them, did in-depth and detailed ideological work, and helped them return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Watching this, I was reminded of many things.

Now that we, the revolutionary masses, have taken power and our status has changed, how we treat the deceived masses is a very important issue. Should we place our deep hatred for the bourgeois reactionary line on those who have been deceived? No! They are also victims of the bourgeois reactionary line. Can we use the tactic of "fighting fire with fire" against those who have made mistakes? No! They are our class brothers. They made mistakes because they were deceived. Our contradictions with them are internal contradictions among the people. Our deep hatred for the reactionary line should only be directed at the formulators of this evil line, the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "The attitude of a Communist Party member towards backward people is not one of despising them, looking down upon them, but of drawing close to them, uniting with them, persuading them, and encouraging them to advance." In how we treat the deceived masses, we are doing exactly as Chairman Mao instructs. We often talk with them, and sometimes we hold discussions together. Through our patient ideological work, most of the masses have returned to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. There was a student who, in the past, was deeply deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line and had serious disagreements with us on many issues. We addressed his specific situation and, following Chairman Mao's instruction to "clarify thoughts and unite comrades," pointed out that he was a victim of the bourgeois reactionary line. At the same time, we seriously and earnestly, yet truthfully, criticized his mistakes. This way, our relationship gradually improved. However, by the end of last year, when we were engaged in another decisive battle against the bourgeois reactionary line, he distanced himself from us again. At that time, some of our comrades said, "Forget about him! We can still carry out the revolution without him. After all, we have done our best." Should we abandon him or continue to help him? Regarding this issue, we studied Chairman Mao's teachings on patiently helping comrades who have made mistakes, corrected our attitude, and continued to help him ideologically. Through our understanding, we found that during this period, he distanced himself from us mainly because he was attacked by some people and believed the rumors they spread. Facing this situation, we further propagated Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to him and patiently persuaded and educated him. Finally, he completely broke with the reactionary line and joined our revolutionary organization at Huajia Middle School.

Through this comrade's transformation, we realized that to help the deceived comrades awaken, we must do a lot of in-depth and detailed work, especially addressing their active thoughts. In our work, we must be patient and cannot be impatient.

Red Guards comrades, we must be the most loyal little red soldiers of Chairman Mao. Let us learn from the successful experience of revolutionary comrades in Shanghai, unite, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, achieve the goal of resuming classes and making revolution, and advance victoriously along the direction indicated by Chairman Mao!

　　沿着毛主席指引的方向胜利前进
　　北京华嘉中学革命委员会　于佐吉
    纪录影片《革命小将最听毛主席话》，给我们上了生动的一课。上海六女中革命战友在革命的大批判中，对受蒙蔽的同志，不是采取歧视的态度，排斥的态度，而是指出他们也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，跟他们谈心，做深入细致的思想工作，帮助他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来。看到这里，引起了我的许多联想。
    现在，我们无产阶级革命派掌了权，地位起了变化。在这种情况下，如何对待受蒙蔽的群众，这是一个很重要的问题。我们对资产阶级反动路线的千仇万恨应该算在谁的身上？算到受蒙蔽的同志们的身上吗？不！他们也是资产阶级反动路线的受害者。对犯过错误的同志能够“以其人之道，还治其人之身”吗？不！不能！他们是我们的阶级兄弟，他们犯错误是因为受了蒙蔽。我们同他们的矛盾是人民内部矛盾。我们对反动路线的千仇万恨只能记在这条罪恶路线的制定者，党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派的身上。
    毛主席教导我们：“共产党员对于落后的人们的态度，不是轻视他们，看不起他们，而是亲近他们，团结他们，说服他们，鼓励他们前进。”我们在怎样对待受蒙蔽的群众的问题上，就是按照毛主席的这一教导去做的。我们经常跟他们谈心，有时还一起开座谈会。经过我们耐心地做思想工作，大部分群众都回到毛主席的革命路线上来了。有个同学，过去受资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽较深，对许多问题的看法，同我们有着严重分歧。我们针对他的具体情况，按照毛主席的“既要弄清思想又要团结同志”的指示，指出他是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，同时对他的错误进行了认真严肃的而又实事求是的批评。这样，我们的关系逐渐改善了。但是，去年年底，我们同资产阶级反动路线进行又一场决战的时候，他跟我们又疏远了。这时我们有的同志说：“算了吧！少他一个照样干革命，反正我们已经做到仁至义尽了。”对他是丢开不管呢，还是继续帮助？针对这个问题，我们又学习了毛主席关于要耐心帮助犯错误同志的教导，端正了态度，继续从思想上帮助他。经过了解，这段时间他所以和我们疏远，主要是受了一些人的围攻，同时相信了他们所散布的谣言。针对这种情况，我们又进一步向他宣传毛主席的革命路线，耐心地进行说服教育。他终于与反动路线彻底决裂，参加了我们华嘉中学的革命组织。
    通过这个同志的转变，我们体会到，要帮助受蒙蔽的同志觉悟过来，一定要做许多深入细致的工作，尤其是要针对他们的活思想做工作。在工作中一定要耐心，不能有急躁情绪。
    红卫兵战友们，我们一定要当毛主席的最忠诚的红小兵。让我们学习上海市革命战友的成功经验，联合起来，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，实现复课闹革命，沿着毛主席指引的方向胜利前进吧！
