	Sri Lankan Communist Party Central Political Bureau member and Secretariat member Samugathasan said in a speech at a meeting celebrating the 24th anniversary of the Sri Lankan Communist Party that the leftist movement in Sri Lanka should abandon the illusion of parliamentary democracy and the theory of peaceful transition to socialism. He said, the important thing is that the leftist movement must grasp the truth taught by Comrade Mao Zedong, which is also the essence of Marxism-Leninism: "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

	He called on revolutionary people to study Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought more diligently as a powerful weapon for revolution in Sri Lanka.

	Samugathasan called on the leftist movement to regard imperialism, feudalism, and reactionaries as the main enemies, to unite all forces that can be united to oppose them, and to overthrow them thoroughly.
