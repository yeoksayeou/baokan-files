The British authorities in Hong Kong brazenly provoked the New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch with armed forces. Our Hong Kong Branch lodges the strongest protest.

New China News Agency Hong Kong, July 21 - The New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch issued a statement early in the morning of July 21, strongly protesting against the fascist British authorities in Hong Kong who dispatched a large number of "riot police" last night to throw glass bottles and wooden sticks at the New China News Agency Hong Kong Branch building and engage in armed provocation. The full text of the statement is as follows:

Around 10:45 PM on the 20th, the British authorities in Hong Kong sent 40 to 50 "riot police" to the location of our branch on Saik Yuen Street. While arbitrarily tearing down the anti-violence slogans and patriotic newspapers posted outside the Nan Yang Theater across from our branch, a group of British "riot police" actually pointed long guns at our branch's main entrance and building, engaging in provocation. At around 10:50 PM, a "riot police" officer suddenly rushed from the Nan Yang Theater to our branch's doorstep, sticking his long gun into our branch's door, assuming a shooting posture, and threatening our branch's staff inside the building. The "riot police" also threw glass bottles and wooden sticks at our branch building. This is a very serious incident of armed provocation against our agency. We strongly protest against this and solemnly declare: The British authorities in Hong Kong must immediately stop their provocation against our agency and guarantee that no similar incidents will occur in the future. Otherwise, all serious consequences arising from this shall be the full responsibility of the British authorities in Hong Kong.

    港英当局公然对新华社香港分社进行武装挑衅
    我香港分社提出最强烈抗议
    新华社香港二十一日电　新华社香港分社二十一日凌晨发表声明，强烈抗议港英法西斯当局在二十日晚间出动大批“防暴队”，对新华社香港分社大厦投掷玻璃瓶和木块，并进行武装挑衅。声明全文如下：
    二十日晚上十时四十五分左右，港英当局派出四、五十名“防暴队”到达分社所在的霎西街，在无理撕毁分社对面南洋戏院门外张贴的抗暴标语和爱国报纸的同时，一批港英“防暴队”，竟然拿着长枪指着我分社正门和大厦，进行挑衅。十时五十分左右，一个“防暴队”队员竟突然从南洋戏院冲到我社门前，把长枪伸进我社门内，作开枪射击姿态，威吓我分社大厦内的工作人员，“防暴队”还向分社大厦投掷了玻璃瓶和木块。这是对我社武装挑衅的一项十分严重的事件。对此，我们提出最严重的抗议，并严正声明：港英当局必须立即停止对我社的挑衅，保证今后不再发生任何类似事件。否则，由此而引起的一切严重后果，应由港英当局负全部责任。
