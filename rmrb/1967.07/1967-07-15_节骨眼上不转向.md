The situation is evolving, and the struggle is deepening. Under the guidance of our great helmsman Chairman Mao, the ship of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is sailing against the wind and waves, forging ahead to victory.

Every revolutionary of the proletariat must closely follow Chairman Mao, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and ensure that at critical junctures, we do not deviate or lose our way. This requires us to: at every critical moment in the revolution's development, strive to study every new directive and every new call issued by Chairman Mao and the Central Committee of the Party, thoroughly understand their spirit and essence, and steadfastly and unconditionally carry them out.

If one thinks that having seized power and gained the upper hand means there is no need to continue studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought, one will inevitably veer off course and run aground on hidden reefs and shoals.

    节骨眼上不转向
    南宣
    形势在发展，斗争在深入。在我们伟大舵手毛主席指引下，无产阶级文化大革命的航船正在乘风破浪，胜利前进。
    每一个无产阶级革命派，都要紧紧跟上毛主席，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，保证在节骨眼上不转向，不迷航。这就要求我们：在革命发展的每一关键时刻，努力学习毛主席和党中央发出的每一条新的指示，每一次新的号召，认真领会其精神实质，坚定不移地、不折不扣地贯彻执行。
    如果以为自己掌了权，占了优势，就不需要再努力学习和掌握毛泽东思想了，那就必然会偏离航向，撞到暗礁、险滩上去。
