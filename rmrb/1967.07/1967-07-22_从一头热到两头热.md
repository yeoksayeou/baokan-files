Title: From One Side Hot to Both Sides Hot

Two revolutionary organizations are in the process of uniting, with one side being more proactive and enthusiastic, while the other side is slightly less so. Therefore, the more proactive side has someone complaining, "This is like a barber's chair, only one side is hot."

Being hot on one side is certainly not as good as being hot on both sides, but it is much better than being cold on both sides. One side is half of two sides, and the heat generated by the already hot side is more than half. The heat from one side will inevitably be conducted to the other side, eventually turning into both sides being hot.

Some people pour cold water on the side that heats up first. The side that heats up first must firmly resist and continue to heat up, and must not cool down. "Where there is one degree of heat, there is one degree of light." Contribute all the heat to the great unity of the revolution, contribute to the cause of the proletarian revolution!

    从一头热到两头热
    两个革命组织在酝酿联合中，一方积极主动，另一方差一些。于是积极的一方有人发牢骚说：“这真是剃头挑子，一头热。”
    一头热当然不如两头热，但是却比两头凉好得多。一头是两头的一半，已经热了的这一头所产生的能量则不止一半。一头产生的热力必然会传导到另一头，终究会变成两头热。
    有人给先热的一头泼冷水，先热的一头要坚决顶住，继续加热，千万不要凉下来。“有一分热，发一分光”，把全部热力贡献给革命的大联合，贡献给无产阶级革命事业！
