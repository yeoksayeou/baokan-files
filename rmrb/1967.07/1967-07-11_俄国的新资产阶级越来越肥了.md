Editor's Note: After the revisionist clique of Khrushchev usurped power in the Soviet Union, socialist Soviet Union had already degenerated and changed in nature. Today, ruling the Soviet Union is the new and old bourgeoisie represented by the Soviet revisionist clique. They have turned the state-owned enterprises and collective farms of the Soviet Union into capitalist enterprises, shamelessly exploiting the vast working people of the Soviet Union. This gang of traitors not only destroys and dismantles the originally socialist economy of the Soviet Union, but also poisons the minds of the Soviet people, spreading the stench of capitalism in every aspect of Soviet society.

The Soviet revisionist leaders use various sophisms to deny and try to cover up the fact of the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union, which is in vain. Today's newspaper publishes several observations on the Soviet Union, which, from the reflections of two different standpoints, illustrate what kind of society today's Soviet Union is. British progressive youth feel nauseated when they see the new bourgeois elements in the Soviet Union; reactionary bourgeois newspapers, on the other hand, are delighted to think that the social life in the Soviet Union is the same as in their own countries.

The Soviet revisionist leadership has already trampled the first socialist state in the world, founded by Lenin, into a mess. The rampant capitalism within the Soviet Union and the degeneration of Soviet society make revolutionaries heartbroken, while counter-revolutionaries cheer. The great Soviet people with the tradition of the Great October Revolution will not endure the class oppression and great humiliation imposed on them by the Soviet revisionist traitor clique for long. They will definitely unite and revolt according to the teachings of Lenin and Stalin, thoroughly overthrow the bourgeois rule of the Soviet revisionist clique, and seize back the fruits of the October Revolution that have been usurped by the Soviet revisionist clique!

"The New Bourgeoisie in Russia is Getting Fatter and Fatter"

The American "New York Times Magazine" published an article by Albert Parry titled "The New Bourgeoisie in Russia is Getting Fatter and Fatter," with the subtitle "Party Enthusiasts Ask: Is This What We Struggled For?" The author writes:

The official statement of the Soviet leaders, of course, denies the existence of an upper "new class" today in the Soviet Union, or the existence of the middle class known in the West. However, we clearly see that Russia has created these two classes, the upper and the middle. My guess is that these bureaucrats, technicians, factory managers, artists, and other experts, together with their families, account for at least 10 percent of the Soviet population, that is, about 23 million.

Not only in terms of possessing wealth and enjoying social prestige, but more importantly, in terms of their attitude towards possessing these things, these new notables are indeed bourgeois, because their attitude is that possessing and enjoying wealth is the purpose itself, not just the result of their rise to power.

In today's Soviet Russia, the new middle-class people are neither merchants nor peasants, but the descendants of peasants and workers—engineers. Engineers earn enough money to own their own apartments or houses and can buy more varieties and better quality goods.

Other experts—scientists, senior factory managers, senior military personnel, writers, dramatists—are more famous and happier, but they are not as numerous as engineers and are not as close to the lower classes in daily contact.

Novels increasingly depict engineers, while the Soviet heroes of past years, peasants and workers, are depicted less and less.

More sharply, the middle-class people are eager to own land. The state allows Soviet citizens to use suburban land as orchards and summer retreats, and around every city are countless such "use plots."

Collective farm land is often illegally divided into private plots. The manager of the Volgograd Construction Trust negotiated with the manager of a suburban state farm. The farm manager gave the Trust manager a lush garden in exchange for the timber needed to build his new house. This Trust manager immediately distributed it according to his personnel level: thirteen trees to a deputy manager, eight to an engineer, others seven, others six. A "Pravda" reporter complained: "Through mutual bribery, they are actually buying and selling state land."

Some party leaders argue for the contradiction between the ideal of communism and bourgeois reality. They say that the comrades who founded this country never opposed personal property; what they prohibited was private property. The new bourgeoisie triumphantly says, "Property? I will continue to accumulate it, and I—rather than you, comrades—will decide where 'personal' ends and 'private' begins."

### “俄国的新资产阶级越来越肥了”

专栏：

    编者按：在赫鲁晓夫修正主义集团篡夺了苏联的政权以后，社会主义的苏联就已经蜕化变质了。今天统治着苏联的，是苏修集团所代表的新旧资产阶级。他们把苏联的国营企业和集体农庄变为资本主义企业，肆无忌惮地压榨苏联广大劳动人民。这一伙叛徒不但破坏和瓦解原来是社会主义的苏联经济，而且毒害苏联人民的思想，在苏联社会的各个方面都大肆散布资本主义的臭气。
    苏修头目用种种诡辩来否认并且竭力掩盖苏联资本主义复辟的事实，这是白费力气。本报今天刊登的几则对苏联的观感，从一些来自两种立场的不同反映，说明了今日之苏联到底是个什么样的社会。英国进步少年看到苏联新的资产阶级分子而感到作呕；反动的资产阶级报刊，则兴高采烈地认为苏联的社会生活同他们自己的国家一样。
    苏修领导集团已经把列宁亲手缔造的世界上第一个社会主义国家践踏得不成样子了。苏联国内资本主义的泛滥，苏联社会的蜕化变质，使革命者看了痛心，反革命看了喝采。有着伟大十月革命传统的苏联人民，决不会长期忍受苏修叛徒集团强加在他们身上的阶级压迫和奇耻大辱。他们一定会按照列宁、斯大林的教导，团结起来大闹革命，把苏修集团的资产阶级统治彻底推翻，把被苏修集团篡夺了的十月革命的果实重新夺回来！
    “俄国的新资产阶级越来越肥了”
    美国《纽约时报杂志》刊载艾伯特·帕里写的一篇文章，题为《俄国的新资产阶级越来越肥了》，副题为《党的热心者问：这就是我们奋斗以求的吗？》作者在文章中写道：
    苏联领导人的正式说法当然是否认今天在苏联存在着上层的“新阶级”，或者存在着西方所知道的中层阶级。然而，我们清楚地看到，俄国已经创造了这两个阶级，上层的和中层的。我的猜测是，这些官僚、技术人员、厂长、艺术家和其它专家同他们的家属加在一起，至少占苏联人口的百分之十，也就是说，约占两千三百万。
    不仅从拥有财物和享有社会上的威望来看，而且更加重要的是从对待拥有这些东西的态度上来看，这些新的名流确实是资产阶级，因为他们的态度是，拥有财物和享受财物就是目的本身，而不只是他们飞黄腾达的结果。
    在今天的苏俄，新的中产阶级人士既不是商人也不是农民，而是农民和工人的后代——工程师。工程师挣足够的钱，可以拥有他们自己的公寓或房子，并可以买种类较多、质量较好的物品。
    其它专家——科学家、高级厂长、高级军人、作家、戏剧家——是更加著名和更加幸福的，但是他们并不象工程师那样多，并且在日常接触中同下层的人也不那么接近。
    小说越来越多地描写工程师，而对那些过去年代中的苏联英雄、农民和工人却描写得越来越少了。
    更尖锐的是中产阶级的人如饥似渴地要求自己拥有土地。国家允许苏联公民使用郊区土地作为果园和夏季休息地方，每个城市的周围都是无数的这种“使用地段”。
    集体农庄的土地时常被非法地分成一些自留地。伏尔加格勒建筑托辣斯的经理，同一个郊区国营农场场长进行接洽。农场场长给了托辣斯经理一个树木繁茂的花园以换取建筑自己的新房子所需要的木料。这位托辣斯经理马上按他的人员等级分了下去：把十三棵树分给了一位副场长，八棵给了一个工程师，其他人有的七棵，有的六棵。一位《消息报》记者抱怨说：“利用相互行贿，实际上是买卖国家的土地。”
    一些党的领导人为共产主义的理想和资产阶级的现实之间的矛盾进行狡辩。他们说，奠基这个国家的同志们实际上从来没有反对过个人的财产，他们所禁止的是私有的财产。新的资产阶级以胜利的姿态说，噢，财产么，我将继续积累它，而且将由我——而不是你们，同志们——来决定“个人的”到什么地方为止，而“私有的”从什么地方开始。
