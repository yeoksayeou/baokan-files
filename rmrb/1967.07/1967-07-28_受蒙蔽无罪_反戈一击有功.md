At a crucial moment in the great struggle between the two classes and the two lines in the Wuhan region, when the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in Wuhan are bravely fighting to smash the ferocious counterattack of the class enemy, some deceived masses have quickly awakened and are rising up to rebel. They have opened their eyes, identified the direction, aimed their spears at China's Khrushchev and his agents in the Wuhan region, and at the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes" who insist on the capitalist reactionary line. They have turned against the enemy and launched a counterattack, resolutely standing on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and on the side of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat.

This revolutionary spirit of rebellion is excellent!

This revolutionary action, we firmly support!

The handful of power-holders within the Party and the army in the Wuhan region who are taking the capitalist road are the chief culprits who sabotage the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They harbor deep hatred for the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses. To save their doomed fate, they are desperately struggling. Together with the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes" who insist on the capitalist reactionary line, while suppressing the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and creating a white terror, they also use various vile means to deceive, confuse, coerce, and poison the masses, forcing them into the fire pit. This handful of bad elements are fundamentally opposed to the broad masses. They are not only the most vicious enemies of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat and the broad revolutionary masses but also the most vicious enemies of the deceived masses.

The deceived masses are fundamentally different from the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They are our class brothers; they want revolution. Under the deception and poisoning of the class enemy, they temporarily do not understand the truth, join the wrong side, lose their direction, are deceived, and are tricked. Under the sunlight of Mao Zedong Thought, as the class struggle deepens, they will quickly awaken, expose the ugly face and evil plots of the class enemy, and return to the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

We must believe that the deceived masses can be transformed into revolutionaries under certain conditions. This condition is that they must follow Chairman Mao's teachings to recognize their mistakes, correct their mistakes, draw a clear line with the capitalist reactionary line, and implement the proletarian revolutionary line.

We should welcome and support all deceived masses who stand up to rebel, break decisively with the handful of bad elements, and draw a clear line.

The deceived masses rising up to rebel will inevitably face a serious struggle and encounter various obstacles. Some people, due to their unclear understanding of the struggle between the two lines, have joined the wrong side and cannot turn around immediately; some may have various concerns, fearing that the masses will not trust them, or that they will lose face for making mistakes, etc. Especially when the handful of bad leaders who insist on the reactionary stance see that the reactionary forces are about to collapse, they will surely use various tricks to obstruct the deceived masses from rising up to rebel. All temporarily deceived masses must see through the plots and tricks of the class enemy. At this critical moment of the great struggle between the two classes, they must identify the direction, correct their stance, make up their minds, and bravely stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. This is a glorious revolutionary action. As long as you take practical actions to break with the capitalist reactionary line, comrades will trust you. Regarding the class enemies who deceived and poisoned you, you must thoroughly expose their crimes, pierce their disguises, and resolutely defeat them, making sure they never rise again!

Comrades of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat, we must follow Chairman Mao's great instruction to "unite with all those who can be united with" and strive to unite and support the deceived masses, welcoming and encouraging them to rebel and rise up. We must absolutely not retaliate against them.

We must actively do political and ideological work among the deceived masses. This is a very important task.

The deceived masses awakening and rising up to rebel will be a fatal blow to the handful of power-holders within the Party and the army who are taking the capitalist road and the handful of bad leaders in the "Million Heroes."

Innocent when deceived, heroic when turning against the enemy!

Long live the victory of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line!

    受蒙蔽无罪　反戈一击有功
    在武汉地区两个阶级、两条路线大决战的重要关头，在武汉地区无产阶级革命派正在英勇斗争，粉碎阶级敌人的猖狂反扑的时候，一些受蒙蔽的群众迅速觉醒，纷纷站起来造反了。他们擦亮眼睛，认清方向，把矛头对准中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在武汉地区的代理人，对准“百万雄师”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头，反戈一击，大杀回马枪，坚决站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来，坚决站到无产阶级革命派一边来。
    这种革命造反精神，好得很！
    这种革命的行动，我们坚决支持！
    武汉地区党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，是破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪魁祸首。他们对无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众怀着刻骨的仇恨。他们为了挽救自己即将灭亡的命运，拚命作垂死挣扎。他们和“百万雄师”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头，在镇压无产阶级革命派，制造白色恐怖的同时，还玩弄各种卑劣的手段，千方百计地欺骗群众，蒙蔽群众，胁迫群众，毒害群众，硬是把群众往火坑里推。这一小撮坏家伙，同广大群众是根本对立的。他们不但是无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众的最凶恶的敌人，也是受蒙蔽群众的最凶恶的敌人。
    受蒙蔽欺骗的群众，同党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派有根本的区别。他们是我们的阶级弟兄，他们是要革命的。他们在阶级敌人的欺骗毒害下，一时不明真相，站错了队，迷失了方向，受了骗，上了当。在毛泽东思想的阳光照耀下，随着阶级斗争的深入发展，他们会迅速觉醒起来，识破阶级敌人的狰狞面目和罪恶阴谋，重新回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。
    我们一定要相信，受蒙蔽的群众在一定的条件下，是可以转化为革命派的。这个条件，就是他们必须按照毛主席的教导，去认识自己的错误，改正自己的错误，与资产阶级反动路线划清界限，执行无产阶级革命路线。
    一切受蒙蔽欺骗的群众站出来革命，同一小撮坏家伙毅然决裂，划清界限，我们都应当欢迎，应当支持。
    受蒙蔽的群众起来造反，必然要经过一场严重的斗争，必然会遇到这样那样的阻力。有些人由于对两条路线的斗争认识不清，站错了队，一时还扭不过来；有的也可能有这样和那样的顾虑，担心群众不信任他们，犯了错误面子不好看，等等。特别是那一小撮坚持反动立场的坏头头，当看到反动势力即将土崩瓦解之时，必然要施展各种伎俩，阻挠受蒙蔽的群众起来造反。一切暂时受蒙蔽的群众，必须识破阶级敌人的阴谋诡计，在这两个阶级大搏斗的关键时刻，认清方向，端正立场，下定决心，鼓起勇气，毫不动摇，毫不迟疑，果敢地站到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边来。这是光荣的革命行动。只要你们以实际行动同资产阶级反动路线决裂，同志们一定会信任你们的。对于欺骗毒害你们的阶级敌人，必须彻底揭露他们的罪恶，戳穿他们的画皮，坚决把他们打翻在地，让他们永世不得翻身！
    无产阶级革命派的战友们，我们一定要遵照毛主席关于“争取团结一切可以团结的人们”的伟大指示，争取和团结那些受蒙蔽的群众，欢迎和鼓励他们起来革命，起来造反，对他们绝对不能打击报复。
    我们要积极地向受蒙蔽的群众做好政治思想工作。这是一个非常重要的任务。
    受蒙蔽的群众觉悟了，起来造反，对于党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和“百万雄师”中一小撮坏头头，是一个致命的打击。
    受蒙蔽无罪，反戈一击有功！
    毛主席的无产阶级革命路线胜利万岁！
                                              （七月二十八日）
