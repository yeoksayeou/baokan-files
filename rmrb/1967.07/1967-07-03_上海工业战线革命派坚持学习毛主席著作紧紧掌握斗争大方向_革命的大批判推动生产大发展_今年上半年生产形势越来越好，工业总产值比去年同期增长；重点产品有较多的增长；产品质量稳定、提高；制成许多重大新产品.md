Shanghai's industrial frontline revolutionaries insist on studying Chairman Mao's works and firmly grasp the direction of struggle. The revolutionary big criticism promotes the great development of production. The production situation in the first half of this year is getting better and better; the total industrial output value has increased compared to the same period last year; key products have seen significant growth; product quality is stable and improving; many major new products have been manufactured.

According to Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, July 1: The proletarian revolutionaries on Shanghai's industrial frontline firmly grasp the direction of struggle by criticizing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. This has promoted the great development of production. In the first half of this year, the city's production has been thriving, with the situation getting better and better: the total industrial output value has increased compared to the same period last year; key products closely related to socialist construction, such as precision machine tools, seven-horsepower walk-behind tractors, tractor parts, cotton cloth, pesticides, plastic products, paper, ink, as well as watches and radios, have all seen significant growth in production compared to the same period last year; product quality is stable, and some have improved; many major new products urgently needed for national construction have also been successfully trial-produced.

The proletarian revolutionaries on Shanghai's industrial frontline resolutely follow Chairman Mao's instructions, firmly grasp the direction of struggle, unite the majority, and always direct their spearhead at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They expose and criticize the bourgeois reactionary line of "striking down a large number and protecting a small number" in personnel issues and vehemently criticize the fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious" through their personal experiences. Recently, they have launched an unprecedented scale of people's war in conjunction with the struggle, criticism, and transformation of their own units, focusing on criticizing the "Industrial Seventy Articles." Some factories that were heavily promoted by the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road have established special criticism groups to thoroughly criticize the revisionist line of running enterprises, thoroughly establish Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, thoroughly criticize the pedantic philosophy that restricts the masses' creativity, and establish some new revolutionary regulations and systems. The socialist enthusiasm of the broad masses of workers has generally been enhanced, and the production situation has been greatly improved.

In the sharp and complex class struggle, the proletarian revolutionaries on Shanghai's industrial frontline correctly distinguish and handle two types of different contradictions, firmly grasping the direction of struggle. They follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "mobilizing all positive factors, uniting with all possible people, and turning as many negative factors as possible into positive factors." They approach revolutionary mass organizations that have differing opinions with them with a spirit of self-criticism, seeking common ground while reserving differences, uniting on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, and jointly fighting the enemy. This has greatly accelerated the pace of revolutionary great unity. Currently, nearly 70% of the factories have achieved revolutionary great unity in the revolutionary big criticism. At the same time, the revolutionary great unity has promoted the revolutionary big criticism to develop more deeply, with production getting better month by month.

The proletarian revolutionaries on Shanghai's industrial frontline regard studying Chairman Mao's works as a fundamental measure for ideological construction and making the team revolutionary after taking power. They continuously study the "Three Articles," "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," and the "Notification," as well as Chairman Mao's latest instructions, further understanding and mastering the theory, line, policy, and principles of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution proposed by Chairman Mao. Many factories and enterprises, under the guidance of the People's Liberation Army, have further improved the study system. In the study, leaders of various levels of revolutionary mass organizations take the lead in studying and applying, continuously fighting against the "self" in their minds. The proletarian revolutionaries on the industrial frontline also frequently hold lectures and experience-sharing meetings on the active study and application of Chairman Mao's works, continuously promoting the thought revolutionization of the broad masses of workers, and promoting the continuous development of the revolution and production.

　　上海工业战线革命派坚持学习毛主席著作紧紧掌握斗争大方向
　　革命的大批判推动生产大发展
    今年上半年生产形势越来越好，工业总产值比去年同期增长；重点产品有较多的增长；产品质量稳定、提高；制成许多重大新产品
    据新华社上海一日电  上海工业战线上的无产阶级革命派，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，通过向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，推动了生产的大发展。今年上半年，全市生产蒸蒸日上，形势越来越好：工业总产值比去年同期增长；对社会主义建设有密切关系的重点产品，诸如精密机床，七马力手扶拖拉机，拖拉机配件，棉布，农药，塑料制品，纸张，油墨，以及手表、收音机等，产量都比去年同期有较多的增长；产品质量稳定，有些还有提高；许多国家建设急需的重大新产品，也已试制成功。
    上海工业战线上的无产阶级革命派，坚决听毛主席的话，牢牢掌握斗争大方向，团结大多数，一直把矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。他们揭发、批判在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，又用亲身经历狠狠地批判了“剥削有功”的谬论；最近，又结合本单位的斗批改，围绕批判《工业七十条》，发动了一场空前规模的人民战争。一些过去被党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派重点推行《工业七十条》的工厂，专门成立了批判组，大破办企业的修正主义路线，大立毛主席的革命路线，大破束缚群众创造性的烦琐哲学，建立了一些新的革命的规章制度。广大职工社会主义积极性普遍提高，生产面貌焕然一新。
    上海工业战线上的无产阶级革命派，在尖锐复杂的阶级斗争中，正确区分和处理两类不同性质的矛盾，牢牢掌握斗争大方向。他们按照毛主席“调动一切积极因素，团结一切可能团结的人，并且尽可能地将消极因素转变为积极因素”的教导，对那些同自己有意见分歧的革命群众组织，以自我批评的精神，求大同、存小异，在毛泽东思想基础上团结起来，共同对敌，因而大大加速了革命大联合的步伐。目前，有将近百分之七十的工厂，在革命大批判中实现革命的大联合。同时，革命的大联合又推动革命大批判更深入地向前发展，生产一月比一月好。
    上海工业战线上的无产阶级革命派，把学习毛主席著作当作是无产阶级革命派在掌权以后进行思想建设、促使队伍革命化的一项根本措施。他们不断学习“老三篇”、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》和《通知》以及毛主席的最新指示，进一步领会和掌握毛主席提出的无产阶级文化大革命的理论、路线、方针和政策。许多工厂企业在解放军的带动下，还进一步健全了学习制度。在学习中，各级革命群众组织的负责人带头学，带头用，不断地和自己头脑中的私字作斗争。工业战线上的无产阶级革命派，还经常举行活学活用毛主席著作的讲用会和经验交流会，不断促进广大职工思想革命化，推动革命和生产不断向前发展。
