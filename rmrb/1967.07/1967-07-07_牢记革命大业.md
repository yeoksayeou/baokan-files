This summer's harvest in our brigade is a good one. However, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, in collusion with landlords, rich farmers, counter-revolutionaries, bad elements, and rightists, have been spreading rumors and slander, attempting to sabotage the state's summer grain procurement tasks. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants have detected the foul smell of this wind and have used various forms of meetings—large, small, and field meetings—to study Chairman Mao's great thoughts on "comprehensive planning," "considering the overall situation," and "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people." They have exposed and criticized the black goods pushed by the biggest capitalist-roader within the Party in the countryside, such as "economic leadership" and "sell less, keep more." Many poor and lower-middle peasants indignantly say: "These black goods are attempts to bind us to the 'private' little circle, making us forget about socialism and the revolutionary cause. We must not fall for the class enemy's tricks!" Others say, we cannot rely on the state in times of disaster and forget the state in times of plenty. We must definitely hand over good grain to the state to express the poor and lower-middle peasants' loyalty to Chairman Mao. After heated discussions, everyone decided that in addition to completing the prescribed procurement tasks, they would also, based on the principles of contributing to the state, reserving for the brigade, and improving the lives of the commune members, sell an additional batch of surplus grain to the state.

　　牢记革命大业
    今年夏收在我们大队是个好年景。可是，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，勾结地富反坏右分子，散布流言蜚语，企图破坏国家夏粮征购任务。广大贫下中农嗅出这股风的味道不对，就采用大会、小会、地头会等形式，学习毛主席的“统筹兼顾”“顾全大局”和“备战、备荒、为人民”的伟大思想，揭发批判了党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在农村分配问题上推行的“经济挂帅”“少卖多留”等等黑货。许多贫下中农愤慨地说：“这些黑货，是企图把我们束缚在‘私’字小圈子里，使我们忘掉社会主义和革命大业。我们千万不能上阶级敌人的当！”还有的人说，我们不能受灾靠国家，丰收忘记国家。我们一定要把好粮交给国家，表达贫下中农对毛主席的忠心。大家热烈讨论后决定，除了完成规定征购任务外，还本着对国家有贡献、队内有储备、社员生活有改善的原则，又多卖给国家一批超产粮。
