The reactionary government of Burma, in disregard of repeated protests from the Chinese government and the Chinese Embassy, continues to brazenly restrict the actions of Chinese Embassy personnel, infringing upon the diplomatic privileges of Chinese Embassy personnel. The reactionary government of Burma's blatant violation of international diplomatic customs is a serious step in its continued frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese campaign.

The Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has consistently adopted delaying and denial tactics in response to the Chinese Embassy's protests. The acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy has repeatedly requested meetings with Burmese Foreign Minister U Thant. However, U Thant, fearing exposure of his crimes, has used the excuse of "illness" to avoid meeting with the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy. On July 11, 12, and 13, the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy repeatedly requested meetings with the permanent secretary of the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, U Thun Htun, and the executive secretary, U Aung Kyin. However, the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs either claimed they were "busy" or that they were "not in the office." When Chinese Embassy officials met with other officials of the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, they acted like servants, saying they were only authorized to act as "mail carriers" and could not express opinions. They also slandered the Chinese Embassy for using strong language in its protests against the fascist atrocities of the Burmese reactionary government's anti-China and anti-Chinese actions. However, after being sternly rebuked by Chinese Embassy officials, they often found themselves at a loss for words and sometimes even fled in fear.

Currently, the Chinese Embassy is still surrounded by a large number of Burmese military and police. No one is allowed to pass in front of the Chinese Embassy. Whenever Chinese Embassy personnel and other Chinese staff members go out, they are followed and surveilled by police cars. On the morning of July 11, at 11:45, the acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy went to see the Pakistani Ambassador. However, when the acting charge d'affaires' car reached a nearby intersection, it was unreasonably stopped by Burmese military personnel. When Chinese diplomatic officials pointed out that they had no right to stop the car, these military personnel contacted their headquarters. However, after twenty minutes, they said that cars with this license plate number were not allowed to pass. The acting charge d'affaires of the Chinese Embassy immediately drove to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest, but ridiculously, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs closed its doors and refused to see the acting charge d'affaires. Finally, after the acting charge d'affaires returned to the Embassy and protested to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs by telephone, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was forced to make arrangements.

On July 10, a Chinese civil aviation plane arrived in Rangoon, bringing a certain amount of supplies to the Chinese Embassy. These supplies were unreasonably detained at the airport by the Burmese reactionary authorities for several hours. The copies of the People's Daily brought by the Chinese civil aviation plane for the Chinese Embassy and Chinese staff were also unreasonably detained by customs.

Although the Chinese Embassy has repeatedly negotiated, struggled, and protested, the Burmese reactionary government has not relaxed its blockade of the Chinese Embassy and other Chinese institutions. Instead, it has intensified the blockade. The Burmese reactionary government not only prevents Chinese Embassy personnel from entering areas where Chinese residents live but also does not allow Chinese residents to go to the Chinese Embassy. Even Chinese residents who come to the Chinese Embassy to apply for visas are prohibited. A few days ago, Chinese residents who came to the Chinese Embassy to request visas were followed by plainclothes personnel of the Burmese reactionary government.

All these heinous acts of the Burmese reactionary government, which seriously violate international diplomatic customs and infringe upon the diplomatic privileges of the Chinese Embassy, are carried out under the pretext of "protecting the security of the Chinese Embassy." This can only be a disgrace in the history of world diplomacy.

### 缅甸反动政府严重违反国际外交惯例  继续肆无忌惮地限制我使馆人员行动

    缅甸反动政府严重违反国际外交惯例
    继续肆无忌惮地限制我使馆人员行动
    据新华社十四日讯　仰光消息：缅甸反动政府不顾中国政府和中国大使馆的一再抗议，继续在肆无忌惮地限制中国大使馆人员的行动，侵犯中国大使馆人员的外交特权。缅甸反动政府这种悍然违反国际外交惯例的行径是它继续加紧疯狂反华排华的严重步骤之一。
    缅甸外交部一直对中国大使馆的抗议采取拖延和否认的狡猾手法。中国大使馆临时代办曾多次要求会见缅甸外交部长吴蒂汉。但是，吴蒂汉由于害怕自己的罪行遭到谴责，借口“患病”，不敢会见中国大使馆临时代办。七月十一日、十二日和十三日，中国大使馆临时代办一再要求会见缅甸外交部常任秘书吴吞幸和执行秘书吴翁钦，但是，缅甸外交部不是说他们“繁忙”，就是说他们“不在办公室”。在中国大使馆官员会见缅甸外交部其他一些官员时，他们也是表现出一副奴才相，说什么他们只受权当“邮递员”，不能发表意见。他们还诬蔑中国大使馆对缅甸反动政府的反华和排华的法西斯暴行提出的强烈抗议，用的不是外交语言。但是，他们在遭到中国大使馆官员义正词严的驳斥以后，往往理屈词穷，说不出话来，有时干脆畏罪溜走。
    现在，中国大使馆仍然被缅甸反动政府的大批军警包围着。任何人不得通过中国大使馆门前。每当中国大使馆人员和其他中国办事机构的人员外出，都有警车尾随盯梢。中国大使馆临时代办在七月十一日上午十一点四十五分去见巴基斯坦大使，但是，当中国大使馆临时代办的汽车开到巴基斯坦大使馆附近的路口时，被缅甸反动政府的军人无理拦截住了。当中国大使馆外交官员严正指出，他们无权拦车的时候，这些军人同他们的总部进行了联系。但是，二十分钟以后，他们竟然回答说，不允许这种牌号的汽车通过。中国大使馆临时代办当即驱车前往缅甸外交部提出抗议，可笑的是，外交部竟关上门，不敢接见中国大使馆临时代办。最后在中国大使馆临时代办返回大使馆用电话向缅甸外交部提出抗议以后，缅甸外交部才被迫作出安排。
    中国民航飞机在十日飞抵仰光，给中国大使馆运去了一定数量的公用物资。这些物资在机场被缅甸反动当局无理扣留了好几个小时。中国民航飞机为中国大使馆和中国办事机构工作人员运去的《人民日报》也被海关无理扣留。
    虽然中国大使馆一再交涉、斗争和抗议，缅甸反动政府对中国大使馆和其他中国机构的封锁丝毫没有放松。相反，却变本加厉地加强了封锁。缅甸反动政府既阻止中国大使馆人员进入华侨居住区，也不许华侨到中国大使馆。甚至到中国大使馆申请签证的华侨也受到禁止。几天以前，到中国大使馆要求发给签证的华侨受到缅甸反动政府的便衣人员的盯梢。
    缅甸反动政府所有这些严重地违犯国际外交惯例，侵犯中国大使馆外交特权的罪恶勾当，却是在保护“中国大使馆的安全”借口下进行的。这只能成为世界外交史上的丑闻。
