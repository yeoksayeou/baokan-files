Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, we will fight to the death
— Criticism of "Cultivation" Speech Outline
Jiangsu Taicang County Shaxi Commune Hongjing Brigade Gù Ātáo

The top capitalist-roader within the Party is black-hearted, black-lunged, and black-bellied, and has written a black book called "Cultivation."

What kind of thing is this black "Cultivation"? It is more poisonous than arsenic and more stinky than rotten dog shit. Reading this "Cultivation" is like eating opium, and it will make you lose your way.

What makes me most angry is that this black book points at the mulberry tree and curses the locust tree, viciously attacking our dearest and reddest red sun, Chairman Mao, and opposing the lifeblood of us poor and lower-middle peasants, Mao Zedong Thought.

This ambitious man doesn't see that our seven hundred million people are united into an iron wall, daring to be so arrogant in opposing Chairman Mao, truly a heinous crime.

The black "Cultivation" attacks our great leader Chairman Mao as "self-proclaimed and self-appointed," saying he "cannot become a leader." This crazy attack is like a dog biting the sun, barking in vain. Chairman Mao is the great leader of the Chinese people, the great teacher of the revolutionary people of the whole world, and the reddest red sun in our hearts. We poor and lower-middle peasants love and support Chairman Mao the most. Chairman Mao believes in and cares for us poor and lower-middle peasants the most.

Chairman Mao and we poor and lower-middle peasants are like blood and flesh, water and fish, vine and melon, heart connected to heart. Chairman Mao is our guide, great benefactor, and savior.

Chairman Mao said, "You should care about national affairs and carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end!" Under Chairman Mao's leadership, we have carried out a thunderous and magnificent Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, ensuring that the proletarian iron mountain will never change color.

Without Chairman Mao's correct leadership, there would be no victory for the revolution, and we poor and lower-middle peasants would never escape the gates of hell in our lifetime. Chairman Mao is our closest and dearest relative. A ship sailing on the sea relies on the helmsman, all things grow relying on the sun, and we poor and lower-middle peasants cannot do without our great leader Chairman Mao for a single moment.

The black "Cultivation" uses the excuse of wanting Communist Party members to "be good students of Marx and Lenin" to oppose Communist Party members being good students of Chairman Mao. The top capitalist-roader within the Party opposes us being good students of Chairman Mao, aiming to make us not read Chairman Mao's books and not listen to Chairman Mao's words, fearing that we will arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought and expose their great conspiracy to restore capitalism. We poor and lower-middle peasants will not fall for their tricks.

We will listen to Chairman Mao's words and be good members and students of Chairman Mao. We have read Chairman Mao's books, and our eyes have brightened; we can tell good people from bad. Our ears have become keen; we can hear good words from bad. Our minds have become sharp; we can tell socialism from capitalism. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, we use Mao Zedong Thought as our weapon, exposing demons and monsters, rooting out the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, and digging out the backstage boss of revisionism.

The top capitalist-roader within the Party opposes Chairman Mao, and I will fight to the death with him, knocking him down and making sure he never rises again.

The black "Cultivation" crazily opposes Mao Zedong Thought, advocating "closed-door cultivation," aiming to make us detach from class struggle and revolution, aiming to make us not have proletarian dictatorship.

Chairman Mao's books are about class struggle and proletarian dictatorship. Chairman Mao's books teach us, "Never forget class struggle" and "Class struggle is long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense." Class enemies are not dead; their property has been seized by us, but their reactionary thoughts have not been defeated. Class enemies are like green onions in June, withered leaves and rotten roots but not dead hearts.

Chairman Mao said, "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power."

In the evil old society, power was in the hands of the reactionaries, landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists, and we workers and poor and lower-middle peasants were oppressed and exploited.

When I was three, my grandfather died. At eight, I went to work in a capitalist factory. If my hands and feet were a bit slow, the capitalist's henchmen would beat me mercilessly with sticks, and I didn't even dare to cry. In the cold winter, I had to reach into icy water to pick up silk threads, and my pores would bleed. I truly suffered endless torment. I had to work twelve hours a day, and sometimes eighteen hours with overtime, earning only twelve cents, not enough to live on.

I worked in the capitalist factory until I was twenty-four. I could no longer endure the hardship and thought that going back to the countryside to farm might be better. But who would have known that, upon leaving the factory and going to the countryside, I would again suffer cruel exploitation by the landlords. Renting land from the landlords to farm, after paying rent and taxes, there was still not enough. Working all year round, my sweat fell on the landlord's fields, and my tears fell in my own house. In the old society, power was in the hands of landlords and capitalists. They ate our laborers' blood and sweat, living a life of eating fish and meat, wearing red and green. We poor and lower-middle peasants had no breakfast and no dinner. We did the work of oxen and horses, ate the food of pigs and dogs, and wore the clothes of a hundred birds. The top capitalist-roader within the Party says "exploitation is not a crime." I say exploitation is a crime, and we must overthrow exploitation and eliminate it.

Liberation came, and we saw the sun through the clouds. Power is now in the hands of Chairman Mao, in the hands of the Communist Party of China, and in the hands of us laborers.

Now, the top capitalist-roader within the Party dreams of seizing our power, making landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists ride on our heads again, exploiting and oppressing us, making us suffer twice. We will never, ever agree to this.

We must always remember class struggle, always remember proletarian dictatorship, always remember to emphasize politics, and always hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought. We must firmly grasp the rifle and the seal of power. The top capitalist-roader within the Party's conspiracy to restore capitalism will never succeed.

Our wish as poor and lower-middle peasants is to defend Mao Zedong Thought to the death, to defend Chairman Mao's revolutionary line to the death, letting Mao Zedong Thought illuminate China and the world for generations to come.

Our resolution as poor and lower-middle peasants is to thoroughly criticize, overthrow, and expose the handful of top capitalist-roaders within the Party and all ghosts and monsters, closely following Chairman Mao to make revolution, ensuring that the socialist mountain will never change color.

We must further study and apply Chairman Mao's works, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, turning the entire countryside and all of China into a vast school of Mao Zedong Thought.

Down with the top capitalist-roader within the Party!

Long live the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!

Long live the great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years! Ten thousand, ten thousand years!

Gù Ātáo, a 53-year-old poor peasant from Taicang County, Jiangsu, who is an active learner of Chairman Mao's works, has actively participated in the great struggle of criticism and denunciation. She has spoken multiple times at county, commune, brigade, and production team denunciation meetings, criticizing the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev. Gù Ātáo does not know how to read or write. Before each speech, she asks someone to draw some simple pictures as her speech outline. Published here is Gù Ātáo's speech outline for criticizing the big poisonous weed "Cultivation."

    谁反对毛主席，我们就和他拚
    ——批判《修养》的发言提纲
    江苏太仓县沙溪公社洪泾大队　顾阿桃
    党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，是黑心黑肺黑肚肠，写了一本黑《修养》。
    这本黑《修养》是什么货色？它比砒霜还要毒，比臭狗屎还要臭，读了这本《修养》就象吃了鸦片烟，就要迷失方向。
    顶叫我伲气愤的是，这本黑书里指着桑树骂槐树，恶毒攻击我伲心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席，反对我伲贫下中农的命根子毛泽东思想。
    这个大野心家不看看我国七亿人民团结成的铜墙铁壁，胆敢这样猖狂反对毛主席，真是罪大恶极。
    黑《修养》里攻击伟大领袖毛主席是“自称和自封的”，“决不能成为领袖”。这种疯狂的攻击，只能是狗咬太阳，空咬一场。毛主席是中国人民的伟大领袖，是全世界革命人民的伟大导师，是我伲心中最红最红的红太阳。我伲贫下中农最最热爱、最最拥护伟大领袖毛主席，毛主席最最相信、最最关心我伲贫下中农。
    毛主席和我伲贫下中农好比血和肉，水和鱼，藤和瓜，心连着心。毛主席是我伲贫下中农的带路人，大恩人，大救星。
    毛主席说：“你们要关心国家大事，要把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！”我伲在毛主席领导下，轰轰烈烈地开展了无产阶级文化大革命，保证无产阶级铁打江山千秋万代不变色。
    没有毛主席的正确领导，就没有革命的胜利，我伲贫下中农就一生一世跳不出地狱门。毛主席是我伲贫下中农最亲最亲的亲人。大海航行靠舵手，万物生长靠太阳，我伲贫下中农一时一刻也离不开伟大领袖毛主席。
    黑《修养》里借口要共产党员“作马克思和列宁的好学生”，反对共产党员当毛主席的好学生。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派反对我伲当毛主席的好学生，目的就是要我伲不读毛主席的书，不听毛主席的话，就是害怕我伲用毛泽东思想武装起来，识破他们搞资本主义复辟的大阴谋。我伲贫下中农决不上他的当。
    我伲就是要听毛主席的话，做毛主席的好社员、好学生。我伲读了毛主席的书，眼睛亮了，好人坏人看得出了；耳朵灵了，好话坏话听得清了；脑子变得聪明了，社会主义、资本主义分得清了。在无产阶级文化大革命中，我伲用毛泽东思想做武器，就识破了妖魔鬼怪，揪出了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，挖出了修正主义总后台。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，反对毛主席，我就要和他拚，把他打倒，叫他永世不得翻身。
    黑《修养》疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，鼓吹“关门修养”，就是要我伲脱离阶级斗争、脱离革命，就是要我伲不要无产阶级专政。
    毛主席的书就是讲阶级斗争和无产阶级专政的书，毛主席的书教导我伲：“千万不要忘记阶级斗争”“……阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”阶级敌人是心不死的，他们的财产被我伲没收了，反动思想还没有打倒。阶级敌人象六月里的葱，叶焦根烂心不死。
    毛主席说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。”
    在万恶的旧社会里，政权掌握在反动派、地主、富农、资本家手里，我伲工人和贫下中农就受压迫剥削。
    我三岁死了爷，八岁进资本家工厂去做工，手脚慢一点，资本家狗腿子用棍棒就没头没脑打上来，连哭也不敢哭出来；寒冬腊月伸手在冰水里捞纱头，毛孔直出血，真是受尽迫害。一天要干十二小时，有时加班要干十八小时，只拿一角二分钱，一个人生活也不够。
    我在资本家厂里做到二十四岁，实在无法生活，想回到家种田可能会好一点，哪里知道，出了厂门到农村，又受地主的残酷剥削。租地主地种，收的粮食，交租完粮还不够。一年做到头，汗水淌在地主田里，眼泪落在自己屋里。旧社会政权掌握在地主、资本家手里，他们吃了我伲劳动人民血汗，过着吃鱼吃肉、穿红着绿的生活，我伲贫下中农吃了早顿无夜顿，我伲是干的牛马活，吃的是猪狗食，穿的是百鸟衣。党内头号走资本主义道路当权派竟说“剥削无罪”，我说剥削有罪，要打倒剥削，消灭剥削。
    解放了，拨开乌云见了太阳，政权掌握在毛主席手里，掌握在中国共产党手里，掌握在我伲劳动人民手里了。
    现在党内头号走资本主义道路当权派梦想夺我伲的政权，重新让地主、富农、资本家骑在我伲头上，剥削我伲，压迫我伲，要我伲吃二遍苦，我伲一万个不答应，万万个不答应。
    我伲要念念不忘阶级斗争，念念不忘无产阶级专政，念念不忘突出政治，念念不忘高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗。我伲要紧握枪杆子，保牢印把子，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派想搞资本主义复辟的阴谋，就永远不能得逞。
    我伲贫下中农一个心愿：誓死保卫毛泽东思想，誓死保卫毛主席的革命路线，让毛泽东思想世世代代照亮全中国，照亮全世界。
    我伲贫下中农一个决心，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和一切牛鬼蛇神彻底批倒、批垮、批臭，紧紧跟着毛主席闹革命，保证社会主义江山永不变色。
    我伲一定要进一步活学活用毛主席著作，更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，把整个农村、把全中国办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校。
    打倒党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派！
    无产阶级文化大革命万岁！
    战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！
    伟大领袖毛主席万岁！万岁！万万岁！
    学习毛主席著作积极分子、江苏太仓县五十三岁的贫农社员顾阿桃同志，积极投入了革命的大批判斗争。她多次在县、公社、大队和生产队的声讨大会上发言，批判中国的赫鲁晓夫的滔天罪行。顾阿桃同志不识字，每次发言，事先都请人画些简略的图画作为发言提纲。这里发表的是顾阿桃同志批判大毒草《修养》的发言提纲。这篇文章和文中插图，原载上海《解放日报》，本报略有删节。
