The reactionary film "Two Families" depicts events from 1953 during the period of cooperativization. At that time, the broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants responded enthusiastically to Chairman Mao's and the Party Central Committee's call and embarked on the path of cooperativization. The film, however, propagates the idea that whether it is individual farming or mutual aid teams, whoever produces more grain is better, portraying the poor and lower-middle peasants as unwilling to take the socialist road and desperately pursuing individual farming. This is a blatant lie! From our perspective in Dazhai, over the past decade, the struggle between the two lines has been ongoing, sometimes openly, sometimes covertly, sometimes softly, sometimes forcefully. The struggle between the two lines is a struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie. Yet, the film deceitfully portrays the sharp and complex struggle between the restoration of capitalism and the prevention of its restoration in the countryside as an internal struggle among the poor peasants. It claims that these contradictions are resolved through "awakening of conscience," "friendship among peers," and "neighborly relations." This reactionary film attempts to replace class struggle with "class harmony" and to replace socialist revolution with the bourgeois "theory of human nature." It is a poisonous weed that vigorously promotes the "theory of the extinction of class struggle" by the top capitalist-roader in the Party. We must uproot it!

    反动影片《两家人》描写的是一九五三年合作化时期的事情。当时广大贫下中农坚决响应毛主席和党中央的号召，走上了合作化的道路。影片却宣扬单干也罢，互助组也罢，谁打的粮多谁好，把贫下中农写成不愿走社会主义道路、拚命搞单干的老财迷。这是睁着眼睛说瞎话！从我们大寨来看，十几年来两条道路的斗争，时时有，天天有，有时明的，有时暗的，有时软的，有时硬的。两条道路的斗争是无产阶级和资产阶级之间的斗争，而影片却偷天换日地把农村中尖锐复杂的资本主义复辟和反复辟的斗争说成是贫农内部的斗争；而这些矛盾的解决又是靠什么“良心发现”、“朋辈之谊”、“邻里之交”。这部反动影片妄图用“阶级调和”来代替阶级斗争，用资产阶级的“人性论”来代替社会主义革命。这是一棵大肆鼓吹党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的“阶级斗争熄灭”论的毒草，我们必须把它连根拔掉！
