The Red Flag Combat Team of the First Carpet Factory in Jinan broke through the heavy resistance of the bourgeois reactionary line and achieved victory in the power struggle by the end of January this year. They firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, strove to win over the middle elements, and patiently educated the misled masses, uniting the majority of the masses and cadres around them. By the end of February, a revolutionary committee was established for the entire factory.

However, the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads has not ended. When a capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration current swept through society, a small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the factory took the opportunity to revive the conservative organizations behind the scenes, attempting to bring down the revolutionary forces.

The capitalist restoration current was quickly suppressed. The problem facing the proletarian revolutionaries was how to deal with the misled masses who had made mistakes again. At that time, some comrades in the revolutionary forces were very angry that they had joined the wrong side again and attacked the revolutionary forces, advocating a severe counterattack. The majority of comrades believed that the contradiction between the revolutionary forces and the conservative forces was an internal contradiction among the people. The misled masses were still class brothers. They had made mistakes and should be patiently educated and helped. As Chairman Mao taught, "We must distinguish between enemies and ourselves, and we cannot stand on an opposing position to treat comrades as enemies." If we regard the misled masses as "dead enemies," we will push them to the enemy's side and fall into the trap of the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party.

They also believed that the contradiction between the revolutionary forces and the misled masses in the conservative organizations was a reflection of the struggle between the two lines within the people, and unity must be sought through struggle. However, the target of the struggle must be the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, and not the general misled masses in the conservative organizations.

To educate and win over the misled masses, the proletarian revolutionary forces, in conjunction with the situation in their unit, launched a revolutionary criticism campaign. They held four criticism meetings in total.

The first meeting was to solve the mystery. The misled masses did not admit that they had joined the conservative organization because they did not know the truth. The criticism meeting first solved this "mystery," exposing the crimes of the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party who secretly manipulated the conservative organization, revealing their collusion with some leaders in the conservative organization, their intentions, and so on. Thus, the mystery was solved, and the misled masses truly felt they had been deceived.

Immediately after that, the second criticism meeting was held to lift the lid, exposing the lid of the bourgeois reactionary line, and exposing the crimes of the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party who incited some leaders in the conservative organization to secretly persecute the revolutionary masses. Thus, the misled masses suddenly realized, recognized the true face of the conservative organization, saw that its target was the revolutionary masses, and implemented the bourgeois reactionary line. Old worker Zheng Shuchun said: "A few days ago, they said I had joined the wrong side and joined the conservative organization, and I was still not convinced. Today, I fully understand."

Through these two criticism meetings, the lid was lifted, and the truth was revealed. The misled masses realized they had joined the wrong side and were willing to return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. However, they still had concerns, fearing that the revolutionary forces would not trust them, give them a hard time, and so on. At that time, there were still phenomena of exclusion within the revolutionary forces.

Therefore, they held a third meeting to talk heart-to-heart and find the root cause. Everyone sat together and had a long talk about the struggle between the two lines. Through the heart-to-heart talk, the cause of the lack of unity among comrades was found to be the result of the bourgeois reactionary line, instigated by the small clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the factory and their backer, the Khrushchev of China. The misled masses realized that they had been misled and disliked the revolutionary forces mainly because they had been poisoned by "Cultivation," the "tame tool theory," and the reactionary "bloodline theory." The revolutionary forces also realized that everyone was a victim of the bourgeois reactionary line and were class brothers. After this heart-to-heart talk, the revolutionary forces understood the misled masses, and the misled masses felt ashamed of their past attacks on the revolutionary forces. Thus, both sides focused their hatred on the common enemy. Some misled masses said: "Before, I shouted all day to protect Chairman Mao, but in reality, I served the bourgeois reactionary line. This time, not only did I come back, but my heart also came back."

The fourth meeting was to dig out the roots. They aimed at the common enemy and launched a "people's war," denouncing the heinous crimes of the largest clique of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the party, as well as the poisoning of everyone by the bourgeois reactionary line they proposed and promoted. They also compared and linked the words and deeds of the power-holders taking the capitalist road within the factory, thereby greatly raising the political awareness of the masses and further igniting everyone's hatred towards them. Through denunciation and criticism, everyone further realized that they were bourgeois representatives hidden within the party, the most dangerous people, and the main targets of the revolution under the conditions of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Without thoroughly defeating them, socialism could not be victorious in China. The misled masses further realized: The Red Flag Combat Team's direction has always been correct. If it were not for them to be the most resolute and brave in making the revolution, the power-holders taking the capitalist road could not be overthrown. A misled mass said: Now I finally understand what the bourgeois reactionary line is and what Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is. No matter how many times I waver in the future, I will not be shaken.

In conjunction with the criticism campaign, they also conducted class education through reminiscence and comparison, recalling bitterness and sweetness, as well as numerous heart-to-heart talks and countless individual conversations. The revolutionary forces, in order to help the misled class brothers awaken, were not afraid of ridicule, mockery, or setbacks, and repeatedly conducted political and ideological work patiently, which deeply moved the misled masses. Some misled masses, after returning to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, also helped with a lot of ideological work.

Through this series of work, the proletarian revolutionary forces in this factory truly educated and won over the majority of the misled masses. By late May, more than 90% of the masses and cadres had joined the Red Flag Combat Team. The factory reestablished a revolutionary committee with the leftists as the core, implementing the "three-in-one combination." The entire factory presented a new atmosphere of unity and struggle, and a new high tide of the masses voluntarily studying Chairman Mao's works emerged. The workers actively grasped revolution and promoted production. From February to June this year, they overfulfilled the state production plan every month.

    怎样帮助受蒙蔽的阶级兄弟觉醒过来
    ——济南第一织毯厂革命派通过革命大批判团结大多数的经验
    济南第一织毯厂红旗战斗队，冲破资产阶级反动路线的重重阻力，在今年一月底取得了夺权斗争的胜利。他们牢牢掌握斗争大方向，努力争取中间派，耐心地教育受蒙蔽的群众，把大多数群众和干部团结到自己周围。这样，到二月底就成立了全厂的革命委员会。
    但是，两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争并没有结束。当社会上刮起一股资本主义反革命复辟逆流的时候，厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，又乘机在幕后复活保守组织，企图把革命派打下去。
    资本主义复辟逆流很快被打下去了。摆在无产阶级革命派面前的问题，是如何对待再次犯错误的受蒙蔽的群众。当时，革命派中有的同志对他们再次站错了队，又整革命派，感到很气愤，主张狠狠地回整一通。多数同志认为，革命派与保守派之间的矛盾，是人民内部矛盾，受蒙蔽群众还是阶级兄弟。他们犯了错误，应该耐心地教育和帮助他们，要象毛主席教导的那样，“要分清敌我，不能站在敌对的立场用对待敌人的态度来对待同志。”如果把受蒙蔽的群众看成是“死对头”，那就把他们推到敌人方面去了，就上了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的当。
    他们还认为，革命派与保守组织受蒙蔽群众的矛盾，是两条路线斗争在人民内部的反映，必须通过斗争求团结。但是斗争的矛头必须对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，而绝不能对准保守组织中的一般受蒙蔽的群众。
    为了教育和争取受蒙蔽的群众，无产阶级革命派结合本单位的情况，开展了革命的大批判。他们前后开了四次批判大会。
    第一次大会，是破谜。受蒙蔽群众不承认自己参加的是保守组织，因为他们不了解真相。批判大会首先就破这个“谜”，大揭党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派暗中操纵保守组织的罪行，揭露他们同保守组织中的个别头头有些什么勾结，他们的企图是什么，等等。这样，谜破了，受蒙蔽的群众真正感到自己上当了。
    紧接着召开了第二次批判大会，揭盖子，揭资产阶级反动路线的盖子，揭发本厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派煽动保守组织的个别头头，偷偷整革命群众的黑材料的罪行。这样，受蒙蔽的群众恍然大悟，认清了保守组织的真面目，看清了它的矛头是对准革命群众的，执行的是资产阶级反动路线。老工人郑淑琴说：“前两天说我站错了队，说我参加的是保守组织，我还不服气，今天我完全明白了。”
    通过这两次批判大会，盖子揭开了，真相大白了。受蒙蔽的群众认识到自己站错了队，表示愿意回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。但是，他们还有顾虑，怕革命派不信任他们，给他们“小鞋穿”，等等。当时，革命派内部仍有排斥他们的现象。
    因此，他们又开了第三次会，谈心，找根源。大家坐在一起，大谈两条路线的斗争。通过谈心会，找出了同志间不团结的原因，是资产阶级反动路线造成的，是厂内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其总后台、中国的赫鲁晓夫挑拨的。受蒙蔽的群众认识到，他们所以受蒙蔽，所以对革命派看不惯，主要是由于中了《修养》、“驯服工具论”和反动“血统论”的毒害。革命派也认识到，大家都是资产阶级反动路线的受害者，是阶级兄弟。经过这次谈心，革命派对受蒙蔽群众有了谅解，受蒙蔽群众对自己过去打击了革命派而感到惭愧。这样，双方就把仇恨集中到共同敌人身上去了。有的受蒙蔽群众说：“以前我整天喊保卫毛主席，实际上却为资产阶级反动路线服了务。这回我不但人回来了，心也回来了。”
    第四次大会是揪根。他们对准共同敌人，发动了一场“人民战争”，控诉党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的滔天罪行，以及他们提出和推行的资产阶级反动路线对大家的毒害，并把本厂党内走资本主义道路当权派的言行拿来对照、挂钩，从而大大提高了群众的政治觉悟，更加激发了大家对他们的仇恨。通过大控诉，大批判，大家进一步认识到他们是隐藏在党内的资产阶级代表人物，是最危险的人物，是无产阶级专政条件下革命的主要对象。不把他们彻底打倒，社会主义在中国就不能胜利。受蒙蔽的群众又进一步认识到：红旗战斗队的大方向始终是正确的，如果没有他们这样最坚决、最勇敢地闹革命，是打不倒走资本主义道路当权派的。一个受蒙蔽的群众说：现在我算认清什么是资产阶级反动路线，什么是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线了，以后再有多少次反复，也不会动摇了。
    配合大批判，他们还进行了回忆对比、忆苦思甜的阶级教育和多次的谈心会，以及无数次的个别交谈。革命派为了帮助受蒙蔽的阶级兄弟觉悟过来，不怕讽刺、讥笑、碰钉子，多次耐心地进行政治思想工作，使受蒙蔽的群众很受感动。有的受蒙蔽的群众回到毛主席的革命路线上来以后，也帮助做了很多思想工作。
    经过这一系列的工作，这个厂的无产阶级革命派真正把大多数受蒙蔽的群众教育争取过来了。到五月下旬，百分之九十以上的群众和干部参加了红旗战斗队。全厂重新成立了以左派为核心的“三结合”革命委员会。全厂出现一片团结战斗的新气象，出现群众更自觉地学习毛主席著作的新高潮。职工们积极抓革命促生产，从今年二月到六月，月月超额完成国家生产计划。　本报记者
