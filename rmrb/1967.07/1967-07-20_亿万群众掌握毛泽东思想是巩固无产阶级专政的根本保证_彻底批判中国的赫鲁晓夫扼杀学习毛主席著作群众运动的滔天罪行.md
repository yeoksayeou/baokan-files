The world is now entering a new era with Mao Zedong Thought as its great banner. In recent years, the broad cadres and soldiers of our army and the people of the entire nation, under the call of Comrade Lin Biao, have launched a magnificent movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works. However, the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road has frantically opposed Mao Zedong Thought and desperately sabotaged the movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, attempting to extinguish this great movement of the masses. The ant trying to shake a big tree is laughable and self-deluding. The wolfish ambitions of the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road will never succeed.

The Malicious Methods of China's Khrushchev in Suppressing the Movement to Study Chairman Mao's Works

The first malicious method used by the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road to suppress the movement to study Chairman Mao's works is to deliberately belittle the great significance of Mao Zedong Thought. He absurdly claims that "all major principle issues in the world" have already been solved by Marx, Engels, Lenin, and Stalin. He once stipulated that one must not mention "studying Mao Zedong Thought," especially emphasizing that one must not equate studying "Mao Zedong Thought" with studying "Marxism-Leninism." He waves the red flag to oppose the red flag, using the study of Marxism-Leninism classics as an excuse to oppose the study of Chairman Mao's works; using the study of foreign experiences, especially Soviet experiences, as an excuse to oppose the study of Chinese revolutionary experiences; using the slogan of "being good students of Marx and Lenin" as an excuse to oppose being good students of Chairman Mao. He attempts to deny that Mao Zedong Thought is a new stage in the development of Marxism-Leninism, attempting to overturn this new great milestone in the history of Marxism's development. Does he really want people to be good students of Marx and Lenin? No. In the present era, to truly be good students of Marx and Lenin, one must definitely be good students of Chairman Mao. To betray Mao Zedong Thought is to fundamentally betray Marxism-Leninism.

The second malicious method used by the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road to suppress the movement to study Chairman Mao's works is to attack Mao Zedong Thought as "dogmatism," openly shouting that Chairman Mao's works are outdated in this aspect and that aspect. The more the movement to study Chairman Mao's works flourishes, the more frantically he opposes so-called "dogmatism." At the same time, he vigorously advocates "learning from everyone who has truth, both inside and outside the Party." Look! How this great schemer is so arrogant! He thinks that by cursing, he can overthrow the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought and stuff his revisionist trash into people's minds as "truth." However, Mao Zedong Thought is the greatest revolutionary science, the highest truth of the proletariat tested by long-term revolutionary struggles, the unified action guideline for the entire Party, army, and nation, and an invincible truth that no enemy can curse down and no other ideology can replace.

The third malicious method used by the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road to suppress the movement to study Chairman Mao's works is to vehemently oppose the method of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works. He slanders the masses' studying and applying Chairman Mao's works as "simplification," "vulgarization," and "formalism," advocating "hearing nothing outside the window" and using academic methods to "study theory and raise consciousness." Here, China's Khrushchev is not opposing the issue of study methods but is attempting to block the path for billions of people to master Mao Zedong Thought. Mao Zedong Thought can only be truly learned and applied in struggle. If one follows his methods, there would be no movement to study Chairman Mao's works among the masses, and the broad masses would not be able to truly master Mao Zedong Thought.

The biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, in order to suppress the movement to study Chairman Mao's works, also uses his usurped power to take various administrative measures, strike down activists who study Chairman Mao's works, restrict the publication and distribution of Chairman Mao's works, and obstruct the widespread dissemination of Mao Zedong Thought.

The biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road so brazenly attacks Mao Zedong Thought and suppresses the movement to study Chairman Mao's works, posing the greatest challenge to the 700 million Chinese people. However, the blood-bond between the billions of people and Mao Zedong Thought is unbreakable and inseparable by any reactionary force. The more the enemy opposes the spread of Mao Zedong Thought, the more the people love Mao Zedong Thought and diligently and arduously study and apply Chairman Mao's works.

Comrade Lin Biao has always unwaveringly propagated and defended Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Lin Biao is Chairman Mao's best student and closest comrade-in-arms, consistently and resolutely executing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. He is the best example of studying and applying Chairman Mao's works and has always unwaveringly propagated and defended Mao Zedong Thought.

Comrade Lin Biao has made the deepest, most comprehensive, and most profound expositions on the great significance of studying Mao Zedong Thought, continuously raising the masses' understanding of studying Chairman Mao's works to new heights and continuously proposing new study requirements. On the eve of the nation's victory in 1949, Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: "There are many reasons for the victory of the Chinese revolution, but the main and decisive reason is that we have mastered Marxism-Leninism and have Mao Zedong Thought." After Comrade Lin Biao took charge of the Military Commission, he further raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, calling on the entire army: "We must truly master Mao Zedong Thought," "Read Chairman Mao's books, listen to Chairman Mao's words, act according to Chairman Mao's instructions, and be good soldiers of Chairman Mao." Comrade Lin Biao pointed out: Mao Zedong Thought is the highest level of Marxism-Leninism in contemporary times. "Mao Zedong Thought is the lighthouse of mankind, the sharpest weapon of world revolution, and the universal truth applicable everywhere." He stressed: We must place the study and application of Chairman Mao's works in the foremost position in all work. He emphasized: Chairman Mao's words are the highest in level, the highest in prestige, and the greatest in power. Every word is truth, and one sentence is worth ten thousand. To adapt to the new situation of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, he called on all officers and soldiers of our army to raise the movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works to a new stage; he called on the entire nation to greatly establish Mao Zedong Thought and unify the thoughts and actions of the people of the entire nation with Mao Zedong Thought. Whoever opposes Chairman Mao, "the entire Party will execute him, and the entire nation will condemn him." Comrade Lin Biao's series of instructions have continuously deepened the masses' understanding of the great significance of Mao Zedong Thought, enhanced their deep class feelings for Chairman Mao's works, and dealt a fatal blow to China's Khrushchev's schemes to belittle and attack Mao Zedong Thought and obstruct the movement to study Chairman Mao's works.

Comrade Lin Biao also proposed the complete set of principles and methods for studying Chairman Mao's works: "Study with questions, apply actively, study and apply together, learn what is urgently needed first, see immediate results, and focus on the 'use' aspect." Billions of people, following Comrade Lin Biao's instructions, have studied in struggle and applied in struggle, opening up a new era for the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers to directly master Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

Under the education and inspiration of Comrade Lin Biao, our army has continuously launched high tides of studying Chairman Mao's works, promoting thought revolutionization. In the struggle between the two lines of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and in carrying out the tasks of "supporting the left, criticizing revisionism, and repelling the right," it has again studied and applied to new levels, making our army an unparalleled great army that is infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao, infinitely loyal to Mao Zedong Thought, and infinitely loyal to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and a firm pillar for defending the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Our army's vigorous promotion of the movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works has influenced the entire nation. The people of the entire nation have learned from the People's Liberation Army, turning our great motherland into a great school of Mao Zedong Thought. Now, this movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works is rapidly developing from China to the world. China's Khrushchev has been beaten black and blue in the face of the great movement of billions of people studying and mastering Mao Zedong Thought.

The essence of the struggle is the question of consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat or restoring capitalism.

Chairman Mao said: "All revolutionary struggles in the world are for seizing power and consolidating power. The counter-revolutionaries' desperate struggle against the revolutionary forces is also entirely for maintaining their power." The biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road suppresses the movement to study Chairman Mao's works and blocks the billions of people from uniting with Mao Zedong Thought, aiming to overthrow our country's dictatorship of the proletariat, restore capitalism, and obstruct the revolutionary struggles of the people of the world. The billions of people, under the call of Comrade Lin Biao, are engaged in a head-on struggle with the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, and striving to master Mao Zedong Thought, aiming to consolidate our country's dictatorship of the proletariat and prevent the restoration of capitalism. The oppressed peoples and nations of the world are eagerly studying Mao Zedong Thought, aiming to seize this powerful ideological weapon to overthrow reactionary regimes and establish revolutionary regimes. This is a very serious and sharp class struggle, directly related to the fate of our Party and state, and also related to the future of the world revolution.

The history of class struggle tells us: Any ruling class in history must have the most authoritative ruling ideology of their class. As Marx and Engels said: "The ideas of the ruling class in every epoch are the ruling ideas." The dictatorship of the proletariat must also establish the ideological rule of the proletariat. Chairman Mao, with his genius and creativity, has comprehensively inherited, defended, and developed Marxism-Leninism, solving a series of major problems of the proletarian revolution in contemporary times, and solving the theoretical and practical problems of revolution under the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism. Mao Zedong Thought is the concentrated embodiment of the highest interests of the proletariat and laboring people in contemporary times, the most correct guiding ideology of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and the soul of the dictatorship of the proletariat. Therefore, we must greatly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought among the billions of people, making Mao Zedong Thought and the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao occupy the absolute ruling position in the entire Party and nation. Comrade Lin Biao said: "Our country is a great socialist state under the dictatorship of the proletariat with 700 million people, which needs a unified, revolutionary, and correct ideology, which is Mao Zedong Thought." As long as we unify the thoughts of 700 million people with Mao Zedong Thought and unite Mao Zedong Thought with the broadest masses of people, we can make the dictatorship of the proletariat stand unshakable forever.

In the entire historical period of the dictatorship of the proletariat, the class struggle in the ideological realm has special importance. Chairman Mao teaches us: "To overthrow a regime, one must first create public opinion and do ideological work. The revolutionary class is like this, and the counter-revolutionary class is also like this." "The class struggle between the proletariat and the bourgeoisie in the ideological realm is still a long-term, tortuous, and sometimes very intense one." If the proletariat cannot thoroughly defeat the bourgeoisie in this aspect, the dictatorship of the proletariat still has the danger of being lost. Only by using Mao Zedong Thought to transform one's own thoughts and using Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to thoroughly smash the bourgeois and all exploiting classes' ideologies and establish a proletarian worldview can the roots of revisionism be thoroughly uprooted. As long as Mao Zedong Thought deeply takes root among the billions of people, revisionism will not emerge; even if revisionism emerges, it can be quickly overturned.

To ensure that our Party and state do not change color, we need to cultivate and train millions of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. Only by using Mao Zedong Thought to cultivate our young generation and letting them study and apply Chairman Mao's works in the great storms of the three great revolutionary struggles can they grow into new people of communism. Such successors are the most loyal to Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, ensuring that Mao Zedong Thought is passed down from generation to generation, making the proletarian state eternal and unchanging.

The biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road is so eager to destroy the unity of Mao Zedong Thought and the billions of people precisely to remove the soul of the dictatorship of the proletariat, blur the consciousness of class struggle, destroy the mass base of the dictatorship of the proletariat, and achieve the evil goal of restoring capitalism.

Launch a New High Tide of Studying Chairman Mao's Works and Establish the Absolute Authority of Mao Zedong Thought

Chairman Mao said, Marxism is developed in struggle. Each stage of the development of Marxism-Leninism has always been fiercely opposed by its enemies. Marxism-Leninism is developed and deeply rooted in the hearts of the masses in the struggle against various enemies.

After Marx and Engels established the scientific theory of socialism that thoroughly buries capitalism, they were openly opposed by old revisionists like Bernstein and Kautsky. When Marxism developed to the stage of Leninism, it was fiercely attacked by revisionists like Trotsky and Bukharin. However, all this did not diminish the glory of Marxism-Leninism. When Marxism developed to the stage of Mao Zedong Thought, the biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road frantically opposes Mao Zedong Thought, repeating the old tricks of his revisionist ancestors. This is a necessary phenomenon in historical development. China's Khrushchev's actions further expose his reactionary nature, making us more loyal to Chairman Mao and more diligently study Mao Zedong Thought.

Mao Zedong Thought points out the path of armed seizure of power and establishment of the dictatorship of the proletariat for the broad masses of people who have not yet been liberated in the world; Mao Zedong Thought proposes a complete set of theories, lines, policies, and measures for consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat and preventing the restoration of capitalism for the revolutionary people who have already seized power in the world; Mao Zedong Thought also brings hope of liberation to the people under the rule of modern revisionism. In contemporary times, only Mao Zedong Thought can solve the fundamental problems facing the world, and only Mao Zedong Thought can save the world. We resolutely expose and criticize China's Khrushchev's heinous crimes of resisting Mao Zedong Thought and sabotaging the movement to study Chairman Mao's works, further promoting the principles and methods advocated by Comrade Lin Biao for studying and applying Chairman Mao's works, which will further unite Mao Zedong Thought with the billions of revolutionary masses in the world, making the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought further spread across the world. It can be foreseen that a greater scale of world revolutionary storm will sweep across the five continents and four oceans, "to sweep away all harmful insects, leaving no enemies."

Chairman Mao said: "'Lifting a stone to drop on one's own foot,' this is a Chinese proverb describing the behavior of some foolish people. The reactionaries of various countries are also such a bunch of fools." The biggest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road thought that by frantically opposing Mao Zedong Thought and sabotaging the movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works, he could overthrow the dictatorship of the proletariat and make the international communist movement reverse course. He never expected that by doing so, he would expose his true colors in front of the billions of people armed with Mao Zedong Thought. This is a great victory for the billions of people mastering Mao Zedong Thought.

The laws of class struggle tell us: As long as there is class struggle, there will be anti-Mao Zedong Thought currents, and there will be the possibility of overthrowing the dictatorship of the proletariat. We must enthusiastically respond to Comrade Lin Biao's call, launch a new high tide of studying Chairman Mao's works, establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and carry out the movement to study and apply Chairman Mao's works more widely and deeply, passing down Mao Zedong Thought for thousands of years, making the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought fly high in the world forever!

    亿万群众掌握毛泽东思想是巩固无产阶级专政的根本保证
    ——彻底批判中国的赫鲁晓夫扼杀学习毛主席著作群众运动的滔天罪行
    广宣
    现在世界正进入一个以毛泽东思想为伟大旗帜的新时代。最近几年，我军广大干部战士和全国人民，在林副主席号召下，普遍掀起了波澜壮阔的活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动。但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，拚命地破坏活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，妄图把这场伟大的群众运动扑灭下去。蚍蜉撼大树，可笑不自量。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的狼子野心是永远也不能得逞的。
    中国的赫鲁晓夫扼杀学习毛主席著作群众运动的恶毒手法
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派扼杀学习毛主席著作的群众运动所采取的第一个恶毒手法，是竭力贬低毛泽东思想的伟大意义。他胡说“世界任何大的原则问题”，马恩列斯“均已经解决了”。他曾经规定不准提“学习毛泽东思想”，特别强调不准把学习“毛泽东思想”和学习“马克思列宁主义”并列起来。他打着“红旗”反红旗，以学习马克思列宁主义经典著作为借口，反对学习毛主席著作；以学习外国经验、苏联经验为借口，反对学习中国革命经验；以“做马克思和列宁的好学生”为借口，反对做毛主席的好学生。他妄图否认毛泽东思想是马克思列宁主义发展的新阶段，妄图推翻马克思主义发展史上这个新的伟大的里程碑。他真的要人们做马克思列宁的好学生吗？不。在现时代，要真正做马克思列宁的好学生，就一定要做毛主席的好学生。背叛毛泽东思想，就是从根本上背叛了马克思列宁主义。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派扼杀学习毛主席著作群众运动的第二个恶毒手法，是攻击毛泽东思想是“教条”，公开叫嚷毛主席著作这也过时了，那也过时了。学习毛主席著作群众运动越是蓬勃发展，他越是疯狂地大反特反所谓“教条主义”。与此同时，他却大肆鼓吹“向党内外一切有真理的人学习”。看！这个大阴谋家多么得意忘形！他以为这样一骂就可以把毛泽东思想的绝对权威骂倒，就可以把他的修正主义黑货当作“真理”塞到人们头脑里去。但是，毛泽东思想是最伟大的革命科学，是经过长期革命斗争考验的无产阶级的最高真理，是全党全军全国人民的统一的行动纲领，是任何敌人骂不倒，任何思想代替不了的。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派扼杀学习毛主席著作群众运动的第三个恶毒手法，是极力反对活学活用毛主席著作的方法。他污蔑群众活学活用毛主席著作是“简单化”、“庸俗化”、“形式主义”，提倡“两耳不闻窗外事”，用学院式的学习方法去“学习理论，提高认识”。在这里，中国的赫鲁晓夫反对的绝不是什么学习方法问题，而是妄图把亿万群众掌握毛泽东思想的道路堵死。毛泽东思想只有在斗争中学，在斗争中用，才能真正学到手，如果按他那一套做，就没有学习毛主席著作的群众运动了，广大群众就不能真正掌握毛泽东思想。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，为了扼杀学习毛主席著作的群众运动，还利用他篡夺的职权，采取各种行政手段，打击学习毛主席著作积极分子，限制毛主席著作的出版发行，阻挠毛泽东思想的广泛传播。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派这样放肆地攻击毛泽东思想，扼杀学习毛主席著作的群众运动，是对七亿中国人民最大的挑战。然而，亿万群众和毛泽东思想的血肉联系，是任何反动势力割不断、分不开的。敌人越是反对毛泽东思想的传播，人民越是热爱毛泽东思想，越是勤奋地、刻苦地活学活用毛主席著作。
    林彪副主席始终不渝地宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想
    林彪副主席是毛主席最好的学生、最亲密的战友，一贯最忠实、最坚决、最彻底地执行毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，他是活学活用毛主席著作的最好的榜样，他始终不渝地宣传和捍卫毛泽东思想。
    林彪副主席对学习毛泽东思想的伟大意义作了最深刻、最全面、最精辟的阐述，不断地把群众学习毛主席著作的认识提到新的高度，不断地提出新的学习要求。在一九四九年全国胜利前夕，林副主席就指出：
  “中国革命胜利的原因很多，但主要的具有决定性的原因就是我们掌握了马克思列宁主义，有了毛泽东思想。”林副主席主持军委工作以后，更进一步高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，号召全军：“一定要把毛泽东思想真正学到手”，“读毛主席的书，听毛主席的话，照毛主席的指示办事，做毛主席的好战士”。林彪副主席指出：毛泽东思想是当代最高水平的马克思列宁主义。“毛泽东思想是人类的灯塔，是世界革命的最锐利的武器，是放之四海而皆准的普遍真理。”要把活学活用毛主席著作放在一切工作的首位。他强调指出：毛主席的话，水平最高，威信最高，威力最大，句句是真理，一句顶一万句。为了适应无产阶级文化大革命的新形势，他号召我军全体指战员把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动提高到一个新的阶段；号召全国大学大立毛泽东思想，用毛泽东思想统一全国人民的思想和行动。谁反对毛主席，“全党共诛之，全国共讨之。”林彪副主席这一系列指示，不断加深了群众对毛泽东思想伟大意义的认识，增强了对毛主席著作的深厚的阶级感情，给中国的赫鲁晓夫贬低和攻击毛泽东思想、阻挠学习毛主席著作群众运动的阴谋以致命的打击。
    林彪副主席还提出了“带着问题学，活学活用，学用结合，急用先学，立竿见影，在‘用’字上狠下功夫”的一套完整的学习毛主席著作的原则和方法。亿万群众按照林彪副主席的指示，在斗争中学，在斗争中用，开辟了广大工农兵直接掌握马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的新纪元。
    在林彪副主席的教育和鼓舞下，我军不断地掀起学习毛主席著作的高潮，促进了思想革命化。在无产阶级文化大革命的两条路线的斗争中，在执行“三支”“两军”任务中，又学出了新水平，用出了新水平，使我军成为无限忠于毛主席、无限忠于毛泽东思想、无限忠于毛主席无产阶级革命路线的举世无双的伟大军队，成为保卫无产阶级专政的坚强柱石。
    我军大力开展活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动影响到全国，全国人民大学解放军，把伟大祖国变成了毛泽东思想的大学校。现在这个活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动，正由中国向全世界迅猛发展。中国的赫鲁晓夫在亿万群众学习掌握毛泽东思想的伟大运动面前碰得个头破血流。
    斗争的实质，是巩固无产阶级专政还是复辟资本主义的问题
    毛主席说：“世界上一切革命斗争都是为着夺取政权，巩固政权。而反革命的拚死同革命势力斗争，也完全是为着维持他们的政权。”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派扼杀学习毛主席著作的群众运动，阻挡亿万群众和毛泽东思想结合，是为了颠覆我国的无产阶级专政，实行资本主义复辟，并阻挠世界人民的革命斗争。亿万群众在林彪副主席的号召下，同党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派进行针锋相对的斗争，活学活用毛主席著作，努力掌握毛泽东思想，则是为了巩固我国无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟。全世界被压迫人民和被压迫民族如饥似渴地学习毛泽东思想，也正是为了掌握这个强大的思想武器，推翻反动政权，建立革命的政权。这是一场极为严重的、尖锐的阶级斗争，这场斗争直接关系到党和国家的命运，也关系到世界革命的前途。
    阶级斗争的历史告诉我们：历史上任何一个统治阶级，都必须有本阶级的最有权威的统治思想。正如马克思、恩格斯所说的：“统治阶级的思想在每一个时代，都是占统治地位的思想。”无产阶级专政也必须建立起无产阶级在思想上的统治。毛主席天才地、创造性地全面继承、捍卫和发展了马克思列宁主义，解决了当代无产阶级革命的一系列重大问题，解决了无产阶级专政下进行革命、防止资本主义复辟的理论和实践问题。毛泽东思想是当代无产阶级和劳动人民最高利益的集中体现，是无产阶级专政最正确的指导思想，是无产阶级专政的灵魂。因此，我们必须在亿万群众中大立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，让毛泽东思想和以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线在全党全国占绝对统治地位。林彪副主席说：“我国是一个伟大的无产阶级专政的社会主义国家，有七亿人口，需要有一个统一的思想，革命的思想，正确的思想，这就是毛泽东思想。”只要用毛泽东思想统一七亿人民的思想，让毛泽东思想同最广大的人民群众相结合，就能使无产阶级专政永远立于不败之地。
    在无产阶级专政的整个历史时期，意识形态领域里的阶级斗争具有特殊的重要性。毛主席教导我们：
  “凡是要推翻一个政权，总要先造成舆论，总要先做意识形态方面的工作。革命的阶级是这样，反革命的阶级也是这样。”“无产阶级和资产阶级之间在意识形态方面的阶级斗争，还是长时期的，曲折的，有时甚至是很激烈的。”如果无产阶级在这方面不能彻底战胜资产阶级，无产阶级专政仍有丧失的危险。亿万群众只有用毛泽东思想改造自己的思想，以毛泽东思想作武器，大破资产阶级和一切剥削阶级的思想，树立无产阶级的世界观，才能彻底挖掉修正主义的根子。只要毛泽东思想在亿万群众中深深扎下根子，就出不了修正主义；出了修正主义，也可以很快把它反掉。
    为了保证我们的党和国家不改变颜色，我们需要培养和造就千百万无产阶级革命事业的接班人。也只有用毛泽东思想培育我们年青的一代，让他们在三大革命斗争的大风大浪中，活学活用毛主席著作，才能锻炼成长为共产主义新人。这样的接班人，最忠于毛泽东思想和毛主席的革命路线，能够保证把毛泽东思想一代一代传下去，使无产阶级江山千秋万代永不变色。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，之所以极力破坏毛泽东思想和亿万群众相结合，就是为了抽掉无产阶级专政的灵魂，模糊阶级斗争观念，摧毁无产阶级专政的群众基础，达到复辟资本主义的罪恶目的。
    掀起学习毛主席著作的新高潮，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威
    毛主席说，马克思主义是在斗争中发展起来的。马克思列宁主义发展的每个阶段，总是遭到它的敌人的激烈的反对。马克思列宁主义就是在同形形色色的敌人的斗争中，不断发展，日益深入人心，掌握群众的。
    在马克思和恩格斯创立了彻底埋葬资本主义的科学社会主义理论以后，就遭到老修正主义者伯恩斯坦、考茨基之流明目张胆的反对。当马克思主义发展到了列宁主义阶段的时候，又遭到了托洛茨基、布哈林等修正主义者的猖狂攻击。但是所有这些，都丝毫无损于马克思列宁主义的光辉。当着马克思主义发展到毛泽东思想的新阶段，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派疯狂地反对毛泽东思想，重演他的修正主义老祖宗们的故技，这是历史发展的必然现象。中国的赫鲁晓夫这样做，进一步暴露了他的反动面目，激发我们更加忠于毛主席，更加努力学习毛泽东思想。
    毛泽东思想给世界上广大的还未解放的人民，指出了武装夺取政权、建立无产阶级专政的道路；毛泽东思想给世界上已经取得了政权的革命人民，提出了巩固无产阶级专政，防止资本主义复辟的一整套理论、路线、方针、政策；毛泽东思想也给被现代修正主义统治下国家的人民，带来了解放的希望。在当代，只有毛泽东思想才能够解决世界面临着的根本问题，只有毛泽东思想才能够救世界。我们坚决揭露批判中国的赫鲁晓夫抵制毛泽东思想、破坏学习毛主席著作群众运动的滔天罪行，进一步推广林副主席所倡导的活学活用毛主席著作的方针原则，将使毛泽东思想进一步和世界亿万革命群众相结合，将使毛泽东思想的伟大红旗进一步插遍全世界。可以预见，一个更大规模的世界革命的风暴将席卷五大洲四大洋，“要扫除一切害人虫，全无敌。”
    毛主席说：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，原以为拚命地反对毛泽东思想，破坏活学活用毛主席著作群众运动，就可以颠覆无产阶级专政，使国际共产主义运动开倒车。他万万没想到，这样做，反而使他自己在毛泽东思想武装起来的亿万群众面前现了原形。这是亿万群众掌握毛泽东思想的伟大胜利。
    阶级斗争的规律告诉我们：有阶级斗争存在，就有反毛泽东思想的逆流存在，就有颠覆无产阶级专政的可能存在。我们一定要热烈响应林彪副主席的号召，掀起学习毛主席著作的新高潮，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，把活学活用毛主席著作的群众运动更广泛更深入地开展下去，把毛泽东思想千秋万代地传下去，让毛泽东思想的伟大红旗在全世界高高飘扬，永远飘扬！　（原载七月十九日《解放军报》）
