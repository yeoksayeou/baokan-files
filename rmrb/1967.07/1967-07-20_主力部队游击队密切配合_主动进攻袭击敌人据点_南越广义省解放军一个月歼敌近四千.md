The main force units and guerrilla forces in Quang Ngai Province, South Vietnam, have been actively coordinating their efforts to launch fierce attacks against the American aggressors. They have achieved significant victories in recent operations.

According to incomplete statistics, from May 21 to June 20, the liberation forces in Quang Ngai Province fought bravely and eliminated nearly 3,950 enemy troops. This includes 2,075 American invaders and 948 South Korean mercenaries. They also destroyed 63 armored vehicles and other military vehicles, and shot down or destroyed 63 enemy aircraft.

In various battles, the main force units, local armed forces, and guerrilla forces in Quang Ngai Province worked closely together. They took the initiative to attack and counterattack the enemy, thwarting multiple enemy "sweeping" and "pacification" operations. The local forces and guerrilla units in Phu My and Tra Bong counties, together with the main force units, eliminated 1,000 American invaders and South Korean mercenaries in two counterattacks.

During this month of fighting, the liberation forces in Quang Ngai Province continuously attacked many towns and strongholds occupied by the enemy. On the night of June 8, with the help of local people, the liberation forces suddenly attacked a "pacification" personnel "training camp" just three kilometers from Quang Ngai City. They quickly breached the enemy's defensive fortifications and reached the heart of the "training camp." In just ten minutes of battle, they annihilated three companies of puppet troops, killing or wounding over 350 enemy soldiers, and completely destroyed this puppet stronghold. On June 23, the liberation forces also shelled the U.S. logistics base in An Khe, killing 300 American soldiers, destroying 30 aircraft, one armored vehicle, and six cannons.

The guerrilla forces in the enemy-occupied areas and regions under enemy "sweeping" operations in Quang Ngai Province also fought well. They used homemade weapons to bravely and cleverly eliminate a large number of enemy troops. This month, they eliminated over 1,700 enemy soldiers, including 729 American invaders and 517 South Korean mercenaries.

The guerrilla forces also continuously disrupted the enemy's supply lines and destroyed enemy military vehicles. Many sections of Highway 1 and provincial roads connecting enemy bases were frequently cut off. The guerrilla forces laid extensive minefields on the roads, destroying 34 enemy military vehicles. They widely promoted the movement of shooting down enemy aircraft with rifles. Of the 63 enemy aircraft shot down or destroyed, 27 were shot down by guerrilla forces using rifles. A guerrilla unit in one commune in Phu My County alone shot down six aircraft.

On July 4, the guerrilla forces and local units attacked a puppet troop stronghold in Tu Nghia County, annihilating two companies of puppet troops in just ten minutes.

    主力部队游击队密切配合　主动进攻袭击敌人据点
    南越广义省解放军一个月歼敌近四千
    新华社河内十九日电　据越南南方解放通讯社报道，越南南方广义省解放武装力量，积极配合非军事区以南的广治—承天地区解放武装力量向美国强盗发动的猛烈攻势，近来连续进攻敌人，取得了重大胜利。
    据不完全统计，从五月二十一日到六月二十日的一个月里，广义省解放武装力量英勇战斗，共歼灭敌人三千九百五十名，其中包括美国侵略军二千零七十五名和南朝鲜帮凶军九百四十八名；击毁装甲车和其他军车六十三辆；击落和击毁敌机六十三架。
    在各次战斗中，广义省解放武装力量的主力部队、地方武装和游击队都密切配合作战，主动进攻和反击敌人，粉碎了敌人的多次“扫荡”和“绥靖”活动。平山和山晶两县地方部队和游击队同主力部队一起，在两次反击战中就消灭美国侵略军和南朝鲜帮凶军一千名。
    在这个月的战斗里，广义省解放武装力量连续袭击敌人占领的许多城镇和据点。六月八日晚上，解放武装力量在当地人民的协助下，突然袭击离开广义市只有三公里的“绥靖”人员“训练营”。他们迅速越过敌人的防御工事，直插“训练营”的中心区，只经过十分钟的战斗，就全歼伪军三个连，共打死打伤敌人三百五十多名，全部摧毁了这个伪军巢穴。六月二十三日，解放武装力量又炮轰鹅会美军后勤基地，消灭美军三百名，击毁飞机三十架、装甲车一辆和大炮六门。
    广义省敌占区和敌人“扫荡”地区的游击队都打得好。他们用自制武器英勇机智地消灭了敌人的大批有生力量。这个月内共歼敌一千七百多名。其中包括美国侵略军七百二十九名和南朝鲜帮凶军五百十七名。
    游击队还不断破坏敌人的交通线和消灭敌人的军用车辆。第一号公路的许多段和连接敌人基地的省际公路经常被切断。游击队用土制地雷在公路上大摆地雷阵，共炸毁敌人的军车三十四辆。他们广泛开展步枪打敌机的运动，在被击落和击毁的六十三架敌机中，游击队用步枪打落的就占二十七架，其中平山县一个乡的游击队就打落六架。
    七月四日，游击队和地方部队袭击思义县的一个伪军据点，十分钟内全歼伪军两个排。（附图片）
