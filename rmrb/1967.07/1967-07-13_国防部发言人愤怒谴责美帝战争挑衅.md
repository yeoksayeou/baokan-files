Ministry of National Defense Spokesperson Angrily Condemns U.S. Imperialist War Provocation

We solemnly warn U.S. imperialism: Your war provocation will be met with resolute retaliation and severe punishment by the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army!

New China News Agency, July 12th: Four U.S. imperialist F-105 fighter jets brazenly intruded into our sacred airspace this afternoon around 5 PM, conducting a serious war provocation. In the western region of Dongxing County, Guangxi Zhuang Autonomous Region, they fired two missiles at our border defense troops, injuring four of our People's Liberation Army soldiers and destroying one house.

Our heroic People's Liberation Army Air Force immediately took off to intercept the invading American air pirates. The enemy planes, hearing the sound, fled in panic.

New China News Agency, July 12th: Today, our Ministry of National Defense spokesperson issued a statement condemning the U.S. air pirates' intrusion into our sacred airspace and their audacity to fire missiles at our People's Liberation Army. The spokesperson angrily denounced the U.S. imperialists' brazen war provocation.

The spokesperson pointed out that the U.S. air pirates' firing of missiles at our border defense troops was a premeditated and planned action. The U.S. authorities' committing of such evil deeds does not indicate their strength but rather their weakness. U.S. imperialism has been beaten black and blue by the heroic Vietnamese people in the Vietnam War, finding itself in a desperate situation with the "peace talks" charade repeatedly failing. The conspiracy of the Soviet revisionist leader Kosygin to meet with the war monger Johnson to form an anti-communist, anti-people, anti-China counter-revolutionary alliance has been thoroughly exposed before the people of the world. The crimes of the U.S. and Soviet revisionists supporting the reactionary regimes of India, Indonesia, and Burma in their rampant anti-China actions have suffered continuous humiliating defeats. The bloody atrocities committed by British imperialism in Hong Kong and Kowloon, supported by U.S. imperialism, have been met with strong retaliation from the patriotic compatriots of Hong Kong and Kowloon. U.S. imperialism's mad aggression everywhere has met with miserable failures everywhere.

The spokesperson of our Ministry of National Defense said, "Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: 'All aggressors and their running dogs in the world will be buried, and it will not be long.' We solemnly warn U.S. imperialism: Your war provocation will be met with resolute retaliation and severe punishment by the Chinese people and the Chinese People's Liberation Army."

    美机悍然侵入我广西地区向我边防部队发射导弹
    国防部发言人愤怒谴责美帝战争挑衅
    我们严正警告美帝国主义：你们的这种战争挑衅，必将受到中国人民和中国人民解放军的坚决回击，加倍惩罚！
    新华社十二日讯　美帝国主义的强盗飞机F—105型战斗机四架，今天下午五时许，悍然侵入我国神圣领空进行严重的战争挑衅，在广西壮族自治区东兴各族自治县西部地区上空，向我边防部队发射了导弹两枚，打伤我人民解放军战士四名，炸毁房屋一间。
    我英雄的人民解放军空军当即起飞迎击入侵的美国空中强盗，敌机闻声丧胆，仓惶向外逃窜。
    新华社十二日讯　我国防部发言人今天就美国强盗飞机再次侵入我国神圣领空并胆敢向我人民解放军发射导弹一事发表谈话，愤怒地谴责美帝国主义的猖狂战争挑衅罪行。
    发言人指出，美国强盗飞机这次向我边防部队发射导弹的严重事件，是蓄谋已久的，是有计划的行动。美国当局干出这种罪恶勾当，并不说明它的强大，相反，只说明了它的怯弱。美帝国主义在侵越战争中，已被英雄的越南人民打得焦头烂额，走投无路，“和谈”骗局屡遭破产。苏修头目柯西金求见战争贩子约翰逊举行秘密会谈，拼凑反共、反人民、反中国的反革命联盟的阴谋，已在全世界人民面前彻底暴露。美帝苏修支持印度、印尼、缅甸反动派猖狂反华的罪行，连续遭到可耻的失败。美帝国主义支持英帝国主义在香港九龙制造的血腥暴行，受到了港九爱国同胞的强有力回击。美帝国主义到处疯狂侵略，到处惨遭失败。
    我国防部发言人说，我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“世界上一切侵略者及其走狗，通通都要被埋葬掉，为期不会很远。他们一定逃不掉的。”我们严正警告美帝国主义：你们的这种战争挑衅，必将受到中国人民和中国人民解放军的坚决回击，加倍惩罚。
