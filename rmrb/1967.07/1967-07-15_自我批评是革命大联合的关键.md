To the Editor:

Recently, publications have frequently discussed how, when there are contradictions and conflicts between revolutionary mass organizations, both sides should sincerely engage in self-criticism. This is crucial for achieving revolutionary unity with the leftist factions as the core. Based on our experience, for revolutionary mass organizations to carry out self-criticism, the proletarian revolutionary factions, which are politically and organizationally superior, should take the lead in conducting thorough self-criticism.

Our Beijing Institute of Political Science and Law's Political and Legal Commune has, after nearly a year of arduous struggle, grown from an initial 170-plus members to over 1,900. We have united more than 90% of the cadres and masses on campus, and we are in an absolute position of political and organizational superiority. Under these circumstances, achieving revolutionary unity should be relatively easy, right? Actually, it is not.

Why haven't we united the revolutionary forces that should be united to the greatest extent possible? We feel that the main reason lies in ourselves. We had heart-to-heart talks with some comrades who had criticisms of us. They said, "You point out our mistakes, but do you have no mistakes? You also have many mistakes. Have you seriously examined them? Have you thoroughly corrected them?" These comrades' words gave us great enlightenment.

We reviewed Chairman Mao's teachings. Chairman Mao said, "The successors of the proletarian revolutionary cause must be modest and prudent, guard against arrogance and impetuosity, be rich in the spirit of self-criticism, and dare to correct mistakes and shortcomings in their work." However, in the past, we criticized others' shortcomings and mistakes more, while we criticized our own shortcomings and mistakes less. This shows that we lack the spirit of self-criticism and are not "rich" or "brave" enough. When we were charging at the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, we were brave pioneers. When charging at the shortcomings and mistakes within ourselves, we should also be brave pioneers.

Thus, we launched a rectification campaign with self-criticism as the main focus. Within the commune, we conducted a serious criticism of our own shortcomings and mistakes; at the same time, we opened our doors wide, welcoming the revolutionary teachers and students of the entire institute to criticize our shortcomings and mistakes. On this basis, regarding some important mistakes and issues, the responsible comrades of the commune headquarters made examinations at a general meeting of the revolutionary teachers, students, and staff of the entire institute, openly admitting the mistakes of some comrades in our commune who had rude attitudes toward other organizations and the masses.

The responsible comrades of our commune also humbly listened to the criticisms of the other two organizations and actively engaged in self-criticism. This made some revolutionary fighters in these organizations feel that we were sincerely striving to achieve revolutionary unity. In this way, it promoted mutual understanding between us and the revolutionary fighters in other organizations. Therefore, in the recent support for the "Three Summer" campaign, many fighters from other organizations actively worked with our commune's fighters, further strengthening unity in the labor process. This created favorable conditions for our institute to further achieve revolutionary unity by class.

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary factions, we must follow the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, dare to engage in self-criticism, and resolutely correct all our shortcomings and mistakes to contribute to the promotion of revolutionary unity with the leftist factions as the core.

### 自我批评是革命大联合的关键

专栏：革命群众来信

    自我批评是革命大联合的关键编辑同志：
    近来，报刊上经常这样谈到：革命群众组织之间发生矛盾和对立的时候，双方应该认真地、诚恳地作自我批评，这是实现以左派为核心的革命大联合的关键。根据我们的体会，革命群众组织之间要开展自我批评，在政治上、组织上都占优势的无产阶级革命派，首先应当勇敢地带头进行认真的自我批评。
    我们北京政法学院的政法公社，经过近一年的艰苦斗争，从最初的一百七十多人，发展到一千九百多人，团结了全校百分之九十以上的干部和群众，在政治上、组织上都占了绝对优势。在这种情况下，实现革命大联合应该说比较容易了吧？其实不然。
    为什么我校没有把应当联合的革命力量最大限度地联合起来呢？我们觉得，主要应从自己方面检查原因。我们同一些对我们有意见的同志谈心，他们说：“你们说我们有错误，难道你们就没有错误吗？你们也有许多错误，你们认真检查了吗？彻底改正了吗？”这些同志的话，给了我们很大的启发。
    我们重温了毛主席的教导。毛主席说，无产阶级革命事业的接班人“必须谦虚谨慎，戒骄戒躁，富于自我批评精神，勇于改正自己工作中的缺点和错误。”可是，过去，我们对别人的缺点错误，批评得多，而对自己的缺点错误，批评得少。这说明我们的自我批评精神很不“富”，也不够“勇”。我们在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派冲击的时候是勇敢的闯将，在向自己身上的缺点错误冲击的时候也应当是勇敢的闯将。
    于是，我们开展了以自我批评为主的整风运动。在公社内部对自己的缺点错误进行了严肃的批判；同时敞开大门，欢迎全院革命师生对我们的缺点错误进行批评。在这个基础上，就一些重要错误和问题，公社总部的负责人在全院革命师生员工的大会上作了检查，公开承认了我公社某些同志对其他组织和群众态度粗暴的错误。
    我公社负责同志还虚心听取了其他两个组织的批评，主动地作了自我批评。这就使这些组织的一些革命战士感觉到我们是真心诚意想实现革命大联合。这样就促进了我们和其他组织的革命战士的相互了解，所以在最近支援“三夏”中，其他组织的许多战士，主动和我公社战士一起劳动，在劳动中进一步增强了团结，为我院进一步实现按班系的革命大联合，创造了有利条件。
    无产阶级革命派的战友们，我们一定要按照我们伟大领袖毛主席的教导，勇于自我批评，坚决改正自己的一切缺点和错误，为促进以左派为核心的革命大联合作出贡献。首都红代会政法公社　一红卫兵
