A Living Farce of Capitulationism on the International Stage – Criticizing the Reactionary Documentary Film "Visiting Indonesia"

The poisonous film "Visiting Indonesia" is a major exposure of the long-term advocacy of capitulationism by the top capitalist-roader within the Party in foreign affairs, as well as a major exposure of his counter-revolutionary revisionist face. As diplomats of Chairman Mao and the Chinese people, we watched this reactionary documentary film and were so infuriated that our lungs nearly burst. Our first words are: Down with the Khrushchev of China!

The top capitalist-roader within the Party visited Indonesia in 1963. At that time, the world's revolutionary people, with Marxism-Leninism as their core, were engaged in a fierce struggle with the reactionary forces led by U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism. The class contradictions within Indonesia were also very acute. Under such circumstances, a visit to Indonesia should have raised high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, firmly supported the struggle of oppressed nations and peoples against imperialism and old and new colonialism, further strengthened the revolutionary unity and combat friendship between the Chinese people and the peoples of Southeast Asian countries, expanded the international anti-U.S. united front, and exposed the reactionary face of the Khrushchev revisionist leadership clique. This was the need of the struggle of the Indonesian and Southeast Asian peoples and their common ardent expectation.

However, the top capitalist-roader within the Party did the opposite. He took his "wife," the bourgeois element Wang XX, to Indonesia for a nine-day visit. During these nine days, he sometimes waved the red flag in public and delivered some pompous speeches. However, these disguises could not hide his counter-revolutionary revisionist face, nor could they conceal his capitulationist goods!

During the visit to Indonesia, the top capitalist-roader within the Party did not mention Chairman Mao or Mao Zedong Thought at all. He emphasized his own position and expanded his personal influence everywhere. He saw his and Wang XX's giant portraits hanging and heard people shouting "long live," and he accepted them with pleasure, feeling very proud. He had no respect for our great leader Chairman Mao, treating the absence of Mao's portrait as a matter of course, and acted as if he were the "supreme leader" of China. His counter-revolutionary wolfish ambitions were fully exposed!

During the visit to Indonesia, the top capitalist-roader within the Party turned black into white, portraying our socialist construction in a completely black light. He did not mention the brilliant achievements made by the Chinese people under the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, nor did he mention the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people in overcoming temporary economic difficulties and striving for progress. Instead, he maliciously slandered and spread cold wind. The reactionary fallacies he spread in Indonesia made progressives greatly disappointed, while reactionary rightists were overjoyed. The top capitalist-roader within the Party is a thoroughgoing traitor, acting as a running dog for imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries!

During the visit to Indonesia, the top capitalist-roader within the Party completely succumbed to the pressure of imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries. Chairman Mao taught us: "We must oppose not only imperialism but also the running dogs of imperialism. All countries that have suffered from U.S. aggression, control, interference, and bullying should unite to form the broadest possible united front to oppose U.S. imperialism's policy of aggression and war, and to defend world peace." However, during his visit to Indonesia, the top capitalist-roader within the Party did not mention the struggle against U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, nor did he mention the establishment and expansion of the international anti-U.S. united front. This was exactly the same as Khrushchev's visit to the United States. The Soviet revisionist leaders have always insisted on capitulating to U.S. imperialism and uniting with all imperialists, all revisionists, and reactionaries of all countries, haven't they? And this Chinese Khrushchev was not willing to fall behind, practicing what he preached. This could only show that they were birds of a feather!

During the visit to Indonesia, the top capitalist-roader within the Party played the shameful role of a political broker for U.S. imperialism. At that time, U.S. imperialism was plotting to form a so-called "Malaysia, Philippines, Indonesia" federation. This was a big conspiracy of U.S. imperialism to suppress the people's revolution in this region, strengthen its anti-China encirclement in Asia, and destroy Indonesian national independence. This conspiracy was firmly opposed by the broad masses of the Indonesian people and the peoples of the countries in this region. However, the Chinese Khrushchev spouted nonsense, saying things like "Indonesia, the Philippines, and Malaysia all belong to the same nation and will eventually unite." U.S. imperialism directed its faithful running dogs to run around and lobby everywhere to realize this conspiracy. The Chinese Khrushchev came uninvited and willingly acted as a spokesman for U.S. imperialism.

From the documentary film, it can be seen that the top capitalist-roader within the Party did not care about the anti-imperialist and anti-feudal revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people at all. On the contrary, he praised the leading figures of the Indonesian bourgeoisie to the sky, saying they were "national heroes of Indonesia," "great fighters against colonialism in the international arena," "wise leaders," and so on. He also advocated Khrushchev-style "peaceful coexistence" and "peaceful transition" reactionary fallacies. The revisionist poison spread by the Chinese Khrushchev in Indonesia numbed the people's revolutionary vigilance and did a great favor for the Suharto-Nasution rightist military clique.

From the documentary film, it can be seen how intimate the relationship between the top capitalist-roader within the Party and the Indonesian reactionaries was! The leading figures of the Indonesian bourgeoisie used the position of the Chinese Khrushchev to deceive the masses, and the Chinese Khrushchev was also happy to be led by the nose, acting according to their arrangements. He became a monkey performing tricks to praise the leading figures of the Indonesian bourgeoisie and a salesman to boost their status. He was also eager to chat with the Indonesian reactionaries. From the documentary film, it can be seen how intimate he was with Nasution, the executioner with blood on his hands from the Indonesian people, and his "wife" was not behind, pulling the feudal lord of Yogyakarta and the head of the secret police to take photos together, saying, "With you two here, we are safe."

From the documentary film, it can also be seen how much the top capitalist-roader within the Party was infatuated with the decadent and corrupt bourgeois lifestyle! He and Wang XX spent the whole day mixing with the bourgeois figures of Indonesia, indulging in wine and women, and showing their ugly sides. To please the Indonesian bourgeoisie, Wang XX dressed herself up in a seductive manner, wearing a necklace around her neck and showing off her charms. She even proposed to visit the obscene palace and bedroom of the leading figures of the Indonesian bourgeoisie, and the top capitalist-roader within the Party followed her in. All these, he not only did not feel ashamed but boasted about them. He said, "I and Wang XX did not have such a lively wedding when we got married. This time it was like a wedding ceremony for us!" Where was there any trace of a communist in him? He was completely a spiritually corrupt bourgeois element, a Khrushchev-style clown!

The top capitalist-roader within the Party staged a living farce of capitulationism during his visit to Indonesia. This was not an accidental event but a prominent manifestation of his consistent opposition to Mao Zedong Thought and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in international activities. He betrayed the revolutionary doctrines of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought, betrayed proletarian internationalism. He denied international class struggle, advocating class reconciliation. He advocated that the aggressive nature of imperialism had changed, spreading thoughts of fearing, loving, admiring, and surrendering to the United States. He denied the fundamental opposition between Marxism-Leninism and revisionism, practicing national capitulationism towards the great power chauvinism of Soviet revisionism, and praising and beautifying Soviet modern revisionism. He praised and beautified reactionary nationalism, advocating capitulationism towards the bourgeois ruling clique in the international united front. He denied the revolutionary leadership of the proletariat and its parties in the Asia, Africa, and Latin America regions, advocating economism, and spreading "peaceful transition," opposing the vigorous support of the revolutionary struggles of the peoples of all countries, and even demanding that revolutionary peoples lay down their arms and surrender. This is a thorough counter-revolutionary revisionist line.

The reactionary documentary film "Visiting Indonesia" was produced under the direct instruction and participation of the top capitalist-roader within the Party and his wife. He originally intended to use this film to propagandize his diplomatic achievements at home and abroad, raise his "leader" status, and create public opinion for his counter-revolutionary restoration plot to seize the Party and the government. However, he lifted a stone only to drop it on his own feet. Now this film has become a good negative teaching material.

We are diplomats loyal to Mao Zedong Thought. We must, together with the proletarian revolutionaries and hundreds of millions of revolutionary people, raise the banner of revolutionary criticism, thoroughly criticize the reactionary film "Visiting Indonesia," thoroughly eliminate the poison of the counter-revolutionary revisionist line of the top capitalist-roader within the Party in international activities and foreign work, firmly establish the absolute authority of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line to direct all foreign affairs, and plant the invincible great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought all over the world!

    在国际上推行投降主义的活丑剧
    ——斥反动纪录影片《访问印度尼西亚》
    外交部革命造反联络站　姚登山　赵小寿
    毒草影片《访问印度尼西亚》是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在外事活动中长期推行投降主义路线的一次大暴露，也是他的反革命修正主义嘴脸的一次大暴露。我们作为毛主席和中国人民的外交战士，看了这部反动纪录影片，肺都要气炸了。我们的第一句话就是：打倒中国的赫鲁晓夫！
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派是一九六三年访问印度尼西亚的。当时，国际上以马克思列宁主义力量为核心的世界革命人民，同以美帝和苏修为首的反动势力正在进行着激烈的搏斗，印尼国内的阶级矛盾也十分尖锐。在这种情况下访问印度尼西亚，本来应当高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，坚决支持被压迫民族和被压迫人民反对帝国主义和新老殖民主义的斗争，进一步加强中国人民同东南亚各国人民的革命团结和战斗友谊，扩大国际反美统一战线，揭露赫鲁晓夫修正主义领导集团的反动面目。这是印尼和东南亚各国人民的斗争需要，也是他们共同的殷切期望。
    但是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派却反其道而行之。他带着他的“夫人”、资产阶级分子王××到印尼访问了九天。在这九天里，他在一些公开场合，有时也打着红旗，发表一些冠冕堂皇的讲话。但是，这些伪装掩盖不住他的反革命修正主义的嘴脸，也隐藏不住他的投降主义黑货！
    在访问印尼过程中，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派根本不提毛主席，不讲毛泽东思想。他处处突出自己的地位，扩大他个人的影响。他看到悬挂他和王××的巨幅画像，听到有人向他喊“万岁”，欣然接受，洋洋自得。他目无我们的伟大领袖毛主席，把不挂毛主席像视为当然，俨然以中国的“最高领袖”自居。他的反革命的狼子野心，完全暴露无遗！
    在访问印尼过程中，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派颠倒黑白，把我国社会主义建设说得一团漆黑。他闭口不谈我国人民高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗所取得的辉煌成就，闭口不谈我国人民在克服暂时经济困难中奋发图强的革命精神，反而大肆诋毁，大吹冷风。他在印尼散布的这种反动谬论，使进步人士大失所望，而反动右派却欣喜若狂。党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派是一个十足的卖国主义者，他充当了帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的反华走卒！
    在访问印尼过程中，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派完全屈从于帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的压力之下。毛主席教导我们：“我们不但要反对帝国主义，也要反对帝国主义的走狗”，“所有受到美国侵略、控制、干涉和欺负的国家要联合起来，结成最广泛的统一战线，反对美帝国主义的侵略政策和战争政策，保卫世界和平。”可是，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在访问印尼期间，根本不提反对美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的斗争，只字不谈建立和扩大国际反美统一战线。这和赫鲁晓夫访问美国完全一样。苏修领导人不就是一贯坚持要同美帝国主义投降共处，联合一切帝国主义、一切修正主义和各国反动派的吗！而这个中国的赫鲁晓夫竟然这样不甘落后，身体力行，这只能说明他们是一丘之貉！
    在访问印尼过程中，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派充当了美帝国主义的政治掮客的可耻角色。当时，美帝国主义正在策划由印尼、菲律宾和马来亚三国组成一个所谓“马、菲、印尼”联邦。这是美帝国主义镇压这个地区的人民革命，加强它在亚洲的反华包围圈，破坏印尼民族独立的一个大阴谋。这个阴谋遭到了印尼广大人民和这一地区各国人民的坚决反对。可是，中国的赫鲁晓夫却大发谬论，胡说什么“印尼、菲律宾和马来亚都属于同一个民族，终究会联合起来的”等等。美帝国主义为了实现这一阴谋，指使它的忠实走狗到处奔走游说。中国的赫鲁晓夫不请自来，心甘情愿地充当了美帝国主义的说客。
    从纪录影片中可以看出，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派根本不把印尼人民反帝反封建的革命斗争放在眼里，相反，把印尼资产阶级头面人物捧上了天，胡说他是什么“印度尼西亚的民族英雄”，“国际上反对殖民主义的伟大战士”，“英明领导”等等。他还鼓吹赫鲁晓夫式的“和平共处”，“和平过渡”的反动谬论。中国的赫鲁晓夫在印尼散布的这些修正主义毒素，麻痹了人民的革命警惕性，给苏哈托—纳苏蒂安右派军人集团帮了大忙。
    从纪录影片中可以看出，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派与印尼反动派的关系是多么的亲密！印尼资产阶级头面人物利用中国的赫鲁晓夫的地位来欺骗人民群众，而中国的赫鲁晓夫也乐于被人家牵着鼻子走，一切按照人家的安排行事。他成了给印尼资产阶级头面人物大捧其场的把戏猴和抬高身价的广告员。他还热中于同印尼反动派拉拉扯扯。从纪录影片中，可以看出，他同双手沾满印尼人民鲜血的大刽子手纳苏蒂安握手言欢，多么亲密！他的“夫人”也不落后，拉着封建豪阀日惹苏丹和特务头子警察总督在一起照相，还说“有你们两位在，我们就保险了”。
    从纪录影片中还可以看出，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派对腐朽糜烂的资产阶级生活是多么的醉心！他和王××整天跟印尼资产阶级人物鬼混，花天酒地，丑态百出。为了讨好印尼资产阶级，王××打扮得妖气十足，脖子上挂着项链，卖尽了风骚。她居然提出参观印尼资产阶级头面人物淫秽不堪的行宫卧室，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派也跟着走了进去。所有这些，他非但不以为耻，反而大肆夸耀自己在印尼过了九天的总统生活，“我和王××结婚时也没有这样热闹过，这次算是给我们补行了婚礼！”他哪里有一点共产党员的气味？完全是灵魂腐烂的资产阶级分子，赫鲁晓夫式的小丑！
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在访问印尼期间，演出了一幕投降主义的活丑剧，这决不是一个偶然的事件，这是他在国际活动中一贯反对毛泽东思想、反对毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的一个突出的表现。他背叛了马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想的革命学说，背叛了无产阶级国际主义。他抹煞国际阶级斗争，大肆鼓吹阶级调和。他宣扬帝国主义侵略本性已经改变，散布恐美、亲美、崇美、降美思想。他抹煞马列主义同修正主义的根本对立，对苏修的大国沙文主义实行民族投降主义，吹捧和美化苏联现代修正主义。他吹捧和美化反动的民族主义，主张在国际统一战线中对资产阶级当权派实行投降主义。他对亚非拉地区，否认无产阶级及其政党的革命领导权，宣扬经济主义，鼓吹“和平过渡”，反对大力支援各国人民革命斗争，甚至要求革命人民放弃武装斗争，缴械投降。这是一条彻头彻尾的反革命修正主义的路线。
    反动纪录影片《访问印度尼西亚》是在党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派和他的夫人直接指使和参与下炮制出来的。他本来企图通过这部影片在国内外宣扬自己的外交成就，抬高自己的“领袖”地位，为他篡党篡政的反革命复辟阴谋制造舆论。但是，搬起石头打自己的脚，现在这部影片成了一个很好的反面教材。
    我们是忠于毛泽东思想的外交战士，我们一定要同无产阶级革命派和亿万革命人民一起，高举革命的批判旗帜，彻底批判反动影片《访问印度尼西亚》，彻底肃清党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反革命修正主义路线在国际活动和对外工作方面的流毒，大立特立毛主席的无产阶级革命路线统帅一切外事工作的绝对权威，把战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大红旗插遍全世界！
