Under the education of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the deceived masses within a conservative organization in Zigong City have risen in rebellion from within, reversing their political direction and directing their spearhead at a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

Editor's Note: Under the education of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the deceived masses within a conservative organization have risen in rebellion from within, reversing their political direction. This is a good revolutionary action. The comrades of the Mao Zedong Thought May 16th Rebel Corps in Zigong City have set a good example in this regard.

Rising in rebellion from within is not merely about changing the name on the surface, but about truly solving the problem in thought. It is about truly understanding what Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is and what the bourgeois reactionary line is; recognizing where one has gone wrong; finding the source of one's deceived thoughts, and resolutely drawing a clear line with the bourgeois reactionary line, eliminating its poison, and truly returning to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line.

Reversing the political direction not only requires recognizing past mistakes but also correcting them in action. This means directing the spearhead of the struggle at a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, conducting extensive exposure, criticism, and struggle, thoroughly exposing and criticizing the crimes of the masterminds behind the conservative organization and a handful of bad leaders who insist on the bourgeois reactionary line, and resolutely standing together with the proletarian revolutionary masses, fighting shoulder to shoulder.

Being deceived is not a crime, but turning against them is a meritorious deed. The proletarian revolutionary masses and the People's Liberation Army, which is tasked with supporting the left, should welcome and support those deceived masses who reverse their political direction and rise in rebellion from within. They should trust them. As long as they recognize their mistakes and correct them, they can become proletarian revolutionaries.

According to a report from our newspaper, the masses of the original conservative organization "Revolutionary Rebel Army" in the Fourth Engineering Division of the 103 Company in Zigong City, Sichuan Province, have, under the education of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, recognized that they were deceived in the past and have risen in rebellion from within. They have turned against the power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the bourgeois reactionary line, thereby reversing the political direction of the "Revolutionary Rebel Army." Their actions have been welcomed and supported by the proletarian revolutionary masses. To commemorate the first anniversary of the issuance of the May 16th Circular personally drafted by Chairman Mao, they have named their newly formed organization the "Mao Zedong Thought May 16th Rebel Corps."

Their rebellion went through a fierce struggle. In early April, some of the masses within the "Revolutionary Rebel Army" gradually noticed problems with their organization from various signs. They found that a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road particularly favored the "Revolutionary Rebel Army," giving them whatever they wanted, while treating another revolutionary organization in the company differently, creating obstacles at every turn. They also found that the leaders of their organization were secretly colluding with a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road behind the backs of the broad masses, and that decisions made within the organization were quickly known to a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They began to suspect their leaders and the organization, and their dissatisfaction grew, leading to some struggles.

In early May, with the help of the army, some of the masses within the "Revolutionary Rebel Army" began to investigate the background of the organization's establishment and its relationship with a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The investigation results proved that a few leaders of the organization were manipulated by a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and that it was indeed a conservative organization. Many deceived masses, after learning the truth, were very angry and expressed their desire to rise in rebellion. A handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, fearing that the masses would rise in rebellion, used the leaders of the "Revolutionary Rebel Army" to spread rumors that the "Revolutionary Rebel Army" had the correct overall direction and that changing the name would suffice, attempting to continue deceiving the masses. The awakened masses, determined to follow Chairman Mao in revolution, would no longer be deceived. They formed a rebel preparatory committee on May 14th and held a rebel meeting on the evening of May 17th. At the meeting, the leaders of the "Revolutionary Rebel Army" still took the stage to talk about how the overall direction of the "Revolutionary Rebel Army" was correct and that achievements were the main focus. The broad masses were very angry and immediately engaged in a face-to-face struggle with him. An old worker angrily said, "I wholeheartedly responded to Chairman Mao's great call to participate in the Cultural Revolution, but you, with your ulterior motives, led us down the wrong path. Now you still say that the overall direction is correct, which is completely nonsense. We are here to rebel!" After a fierce discussion, everyone agreed: We must resolutely reverse the political direction and thoroughly make a revolution. That night, a new service team was elected. The "Mao Zedong Thought May 16th Rebel Corps" was thus born.

After successfully rebelling from within, they also rebelled against the headquarters of the "Revolutionary Rebel Army," exposing the masterminds behind the scenes, and issued a statement: The "Revolutionary Rebel Army" was a conservative organization manipulated by power-holders taking the capitalist road. They also criticized their own mistake of joining the wrong side, and at the same time, expressed their desire to learn from the proletarian revolutionary masses. They also issued an open letter to other conservative organizations, encouraging the deceived masses to rise in rebellion.

To truly return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line and thoroughly eliminate the poison of the bourgeois reactionary line, they held dozens of detoxification meetings. At the detoxification meetings, they combined self-criticism with mutual help, discussing what Chairman Mao's revolutionary line is and what the bourgeois reactionary line is; discussing where the "Revolutionary Rebel Army" went wrong and where it was correct; discussing how they were deceived and joined the wrong side, and how a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road used them to push the bourgeois reactionary line. They finally found the source of their deceived thoughts and exposed the harm caused by China's Khrushchev's "Cultivation." They published the problems discussed at each detoxification meeting on big-character posters.

During the detoxification process, they realized: No matter how many mistakes there are, they are the mistakes of a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road; no matter how many crimes there are, they are the crimes of a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. While detoxifying within, they also conducted dozens of extensive exposures, criticisms, and struggles against a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. The struggle meetings not only educated the broad deceived masses but also further exposed the cover of class struggle within the unit.

The birth and growth of the "May 16th Rebel Corps" have experienced and are experiencing numerous difficulties. The main difficulties come from a handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and a few leaders of the "Revolutionary Rebel Army" who are manipulated by them. They continue to spread rumors and sow discord between the "May 16th Rebel Corps" and other revolutionary organizations. Difficulties also come from the misunderstandings, suspicions, and distrust of some members of other revolutionary organizations. Some say they are fake rebels. Difficulties also come from the petty-bourgeois ideology within their own organization. Some comrades, seeing that other revolutionary organizations do not trust them, hearing that they are called fake rebels, either become disheartened and want to become "free spirits," not wanting to do anything anymore; or feel resentful and become opposed to other revolutionary organizations. To raise their ideological level, unify their understanding, and better grasp the overall direction of the struggle, to welcome new battles, the "May 16th Rebel Corps," with the support of the Zigong Armed Forces Department of the People's Liberation Army and the Zigong City Proletarian Rebel Headquarters, conducted a rectification campaign. The rectification further eliminated the influence of the bourgeois reactionary line on them, inspired their revolutionary rebel spirit, raised their awareness of using Mao Zedong Thought to transform their subjective world, and laid a solid ideological foundation for new battles.

    在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线教育下
    受蒙蔽的群众从内部起来造反
    自贡市一个保守组织扭转政治方向，把矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派
    编者按：在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的教育下，保守组织中受蒙蔽的群众从内部起来造反，扭转自己的政治方向。这是很好的革命行动。自贡市的毛泽东思想五·一六造反团的同志在这方面做出了好样子。
    从内部起来造反，绝对不是从形式上改个名称，而是要真正从思想上解决问题，要真正懂得什么是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，什么是资产阶级反动路线；要认识到自己错在哪里；找到自己受蒙蔽的思想根源，毅然决然地同资产阶级反动路线划清界线，肃清其流毒，真正回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来。
    扭转政治方向，不仅要认识过去的错误，而且要从行动上改正错误。这就是要把斗争矛头对准党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，进行大揭发、大批判、大斗争，彻底揭发和批判保守组织的幕后操纵者和一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头的罪行，坚决和无产阶级革命派站在一起，并肩战斗。
    受蒙蔽无罪，反戈一击有功。无产阶级革命派和担负支左任务的人民解放军，对受蒙蔽的群众扭转政治方向，从内部起来造反，应该表示欢迎，应该支持他们，信任他们。他们只要认识了错误，改了，就好。也就能成为无产阶级革命派。
    本报讯　四川省自贡市一○三公司第四工程处原保守组织“革命造反军”的群众，在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的教育下，认识到自己过去受了蒙蔽，从内部起来造反。他们反戈一击，把矛头指向走资本主义道路当权派和资产阶级反动路线，一举扭转了“革命造反军”的政治方向。他们的行动得到了无产阶级革命派的欢迎和支持。为了纪念毛主席亲自主持制定的中共中央五月十六日通知发表一周年，他们把新生的组织定名为“毛泽东思想五·一六造反团”。
    他们造反经历了一场激烈的斗争。四月初，“革命造反军”内的部分群众，就从种种迹象逐渐觉察到自己的组织有问题。他们发现党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派特别厚待“革命造反军”，要什么给什么，而对本公司的另一个革命组织却另眼相待，处处刁难；他们还发现自己的组织的头头背着广大群众跟党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派勾勾搭搭，组织内部决定的什么问题，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派很快就知道了……。他们开始怀疑他们的头头，怀疑这个组织，普遍增长了不满情绪，并开始进行了一些斗争。
    五月初，在解放军的帮助下，“革命造反军”内一部分群众开始调查这个组织成立的背景和它跟党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的关系。调查结果证明这个组织的少数头头是受党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派操纵的，它的的确确是一个保守组织。很多受蒙蔽的群众了解真相以后，非常气愤，纷纷表示要起来造反。党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派害怕群众起来造反，就利用“革命造反军”的头头，大肆散布什么“革命造反军”的大方向是对的，改改名字就行了，妄想继续蒙蔽群众。广大觉醒了的群众，决心紧跟毛主席干革命，再也不受他们的骗。他们在五月十四日成立了造反筹备小组，紧接着在五月十七日晚召开了造反大会。会上，“革命造反军”的头头还是登台大讲“革命造反军”的大方向是正确的，成绩是主要的。广大群众听了非常气愤，当场就和他展开了面对面的斗争。有的老工人愤慨地说：“我一心一意响应毛主席的伟大号召参加文化大革命，你们这些别有用心的人却把我们引上了错误的道路，现在还说什么大方向是正确的，完全是胡说。我们就是要造反！”经过了激烈讨论以后，大家一致认为：要坚决扭转政治方向，彻底闹革命。当晚就选举了新的勤务组。“毛泽东思想五·一六造反团”就这样诞生了。
    内部造反成功以后，他们又造了“革命造反军”总部的反，揪出了幕后操纵者，并且发表声明：“革命造反军”是受走资本主义道路当权派操纵的保守组织。他们还检讨自己站错了队的错误，同时，表示向无产阶级革命派学习。他们还发表了给其他的保守组织的公开信，鼓励受蒙蔽的群众起来造反。
    为了真正回到毛主席的革命路线上来，彻底肃清资产阶级反动路线的毒害，他们开了大小十几次消毒会。在消毒会上，他们采取自我批评和相互帮助相结合的形式，大谈什么是毛主席的革命路线，什么是资产阶级反动路线；大谈“革命造反军”究竟错在哪里，保在哪里；他们又是怎样受了蒙蔽站错队，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派又是怎样假手于他们推行资产阶级反动路线的。他们最后找出了受蒙蔽的思想根源，控诉了中国赫鲁晓夫的《修养》对他们的毒害。他们把每次消毒会所检讨的问题都用大字报公布出去。
    消毒过程中，他们认识到：千个错万个错是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的错，千条罪万条罪是党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪。在内部消毒的同时，他们又对党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派进行了十几次大揭露、大批判、大斗争。斗争会不仅教育了广大受蒙蔽的群众，而且进一步揭开了本单位阶级斗争的盖子。
    “五·一六造反团”的诞生和成长经历了和正在经历着重重困难。困难主要是来自党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和被他们所操纵的“革命造反军”少数头头。他们继续制造流言蜚语，挑拨“五·一六造反团”和其他革命组织的关系。困难也来自其他革命组织个别成员的误会、怀疑和不信任。有人说他们是假造反。困难还来自自己组织内部的小资产阶级思潮。有些同志看到别的革命组织不信任自己，听到人家说自己是假造反，或者心灰意懒，想去当“逍遥派”，不想再干了；或者心里不服气，与其他革命组织闹对立。为了提高思想，统一认识，更好地掌握斗争大方向，迎接新的战斗，“五·一六造反团”在中国人民解放军自贡武装部和自贡市无产阶级造反司令部的支持下，进行了整风活动。整风进一步肃清了资产阶级反动路线对他们的影响，激励了他们的革命造反精神，提高了他们用毛泽东思想改造主观世界的自觉性，为新的战斗打下了坚实的思想基础。
