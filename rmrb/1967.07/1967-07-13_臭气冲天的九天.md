The reactionary film "Visiting Indonesia" recounts the visit of China's Khrushchev to Indonesia in 1963.

During these nine days of stench, he had the Indonesian bourgeoisie in power hang his and his "wife's" giant portraits, along with those of the bourgeois element Wang XX, everywhere to oppose Chairman Mao and realize his dream of becoming the "supreme leader."

During these nine days of stench, he groveled before the top figures of the Indonesian reactionary bourgeoisie, taking photos with them, shaking hands, and praising them as "national heroes." Isn't this the same as when he praised the people's enemy Chiang Kai-shek as the "flag of revolution" during the War of Resistance Against Japan, and after liberation, praised the thoroughly treacherous film "The Last Days of the Dynasty" as a patriotic film?

During these nine days of stench, he was intoxicated in the capitalist world of flowers and alcohol, toasting and dancing with the top figures of the Indonesian reactionary bourgeoisie, indulging in debauchery and madness. Isn't this the same as when he said forty-six years ago, "Life's riches and honors are hard to come by, why not enjoy oneself while one can," and a few years ago said he wanted to live a life of "wearing colorful clothes, eating and drinking to excess," and "wearing diamond rings"?

During these nine days of stench, he did not support the revolutionary struggle of the Indonesian people but repeatedly spread the smoke screen of peace, whitewashing the Indonesian reactionary bourgeoisie in power. Isn't this the same as his consistent advocacy of "parliamentary struggle," "entering the city through ballots," and other revisionist theories?

These nine days of stench fully exposed China's Khrushchev's fervent advocacy of the "three reconciliations and one reduction" revisionist line, betraying the dictatorship of the proletariat, and betraying the proletarian revolution. We, the soldiers of the People's Liberation Army, must "hold the motherland in our hearts and look at the world with open eyes," thoroughly criticize the revisionist line of the biggest capitalist-roaders within the Party, firmly grasp our guns, and carry the world revolution through to the end!

    臭气冲天的九天
    解放军某部五好战士  侯智信　孟德义
    反动影片《访问印度尼西亚》记述了中国的赫鲁晓夫一九六三年印度尼西亚之行。
    在这臭气冲天的九天访问期间，他让印尼资产阶级当权派到处悬挂他和他“夫人”、资产阶级分子王××的巨幅画像，用以反对毛主席，实现他一心要当“最高领袖”的梦想。
    在臭气冲天的九天里，他奴颜婢膝地拜倒在印尼反动资产阶级头面人物面前，与他们拍照留念，握手言欢，并吹捧他们是什么“民族英雄”。这和他在抗日战争时期吹捧人民公敌蒋介石为“革命的旗帜”，解放后又把彻底的卖国主义的影片《清宫秘史》捧为爱国主义的影片，不是同出一辙吗？
    在臭气冲天的九天里，他沉醉在资本主义的花花世界里，和印尼反动资产阶级的头面人物碰杯、跳舞，花天酒地，如痴若狂。这和他在四十六年前说的“人生富贵何可期，胡不及时以行乐”，前几年又说的什么要过“穿的花花绿绿，大吃大喝”、“戴着宝石戒指”的生活，不是完全一样吗？
    在臭气冲天的九天里，他不支持印尼人民的革命斗争，却一再大放和平烟幕，为印尼反动资产阶级当权派涂脂抹粉，这和他一贯鼓吹的“议会斗争”，“靠选票进城”等等修正主义理论，不是完全相似吗？
    这臭气冲天的九天，充分暴露了中国的赫鲁晓夫狂热鼓吹“三和一少”修正主义路线，背叛无产阶级专政，背叛无产阶级革命的反革命嘴脸。我们解放军战士一定要“胸怀祖国，放眼世界”，彻底批判党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的反革命修正主义路线，紧握手中枪，把世界革命进行到底！
