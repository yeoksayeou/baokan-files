Liberation armed forces in South Vietnam have been achieving consecutive victories around Saigon in recent days, disrupting the enemy's water and land transportation and causing it to fall into paralysis.

According to reports from Western news agencies, on the 21st, the liberation armed forces launched a fierce ambush on the U.S. 11th Armored Cavalry Regiment on a road about 77 kilometers northeast of Saigon, causing the enemy to fall into chaos. Among the approximately 200 U.S. invading troops, more than 130 were killed or wounded by the liberation armed forces. Four of the enemy's helicopters were also hit by ground fire from the liberation armed forces. This group of enemies, who were engaged in the "clearing of roads" activities, thus suffered a humiliating defeat.

Early on the 25th, the liberation armed forces again cut off the Fourth Highway from Saigon to the Mekong Delta, preventing the enemy's heavy vehicles from traveling on this road. In the days leading up to this, the enemy had tried hard to repair this road, but it was often cut off just a few hours after it was opened to traffic. From the 17th to the 20th, the liberation armed forces dug more than 60 trenches and detonated five powerful land mines on this road over four consecutive nights.

On the 24th, the liberation armed forces also sank an enemy ship carrying 300 tons of cement on a canal about 50 kilometers southwest of Saigon, causing the canal's traffic to be disrupted.

In the outskirts of Saigon, in the Gia Dinh-Di An region, the liberation armed forces in South Vietnam have frequently launched fierce attacks on U.S. puppet troops, foiling the enemy's attempts to "pacify" this region and protect their stronghold in Saigon.

According to reports from the Liberation News Agency of South Vietnam: From early June to July 12, over 40 days, the military and people of these two provinces together eliminated more than 2,000 enemy troops, including over 1,300 U.S. invading troops. They destroyed or damaged 110 tanks and armored vehicles, shot down or damaged 22 enemy aircraft, sank or damaged 9 enemy ships, and destroyed 3 enemy cannons.

On June 19, the military and people of Keo My County in Gia Dinh Province, in the Cu Chi region and some communes south of Saigon, thwarted the "sweeping" operations of the U.S. 9th Infantry Division and 11 puppet army regiments, eliminating more than 650 enemy troops, including over 400 U.S. invading troops. They shot down 5 enemy aircraft and sank 5 landing craft. From July 2 to 6, the military and people of Hoc Mon County conducted counter-"sweeping" operations in the Trung An region, eliminating nearly 100 U.S. invading troops, shooting down 5 enemy aircraft, and sinking 3 landing craft.

The guerrilla forces in Cu Chi County, in the battle to counter the enemy's large-scale "sweeping" operations, destroyed 52 enemy tanks and armored vehicles, eliminating over 300 U.S. invading troops, including annihilating an entire U.S. infantry company.

The guerrilla forces in the counties of Di An and Tan An in Tan An Province, from June 10 to 17, continuously attacked U.S. military bases on the Fourth Highway and conducted counter-"sweeping" operations, eliminating 162 enemy troops, including 119 U.S. invading troops, and destroying 2 armored vehicles. On July 12, the guerrilla forces in Tan An and Tan Phuoc Provinces closely coordinated and bravely intercepted the enemy troops conducting "sweeping" operations in the border region between the two provinces, eliminating 150 U.S. troops and shooting down 6 helicopters.

    南越人民武装在西贡周围连战皆捷
    新华社二十五日讯  西贡消息：活跃在美伪集团心脏地区——西贡周围的越南南方解放武装力量，近几天来在交通线上不断袭击敌人，使敌人的水陆交通日益陷于瘫痪。
    据西方通讯社报道，二十一日，解放武装力量在西贡东北七十七公里的一条公路上猛烈伏击美国第十一装甲团，打得敌人一片混乱。在大约二百名美国侵略军中，被解放武装力量打死打伤的达一百三十多人。敌人的四架直升飞机也被解放武装力量的地面炮火击中。这股从事“打通公路”活动的敌人就这样遭到了可耻的失败。
    解放武装力量二十五日凌晨再次切断从西贡通往湄公河三角洲的第四号公路，使敌人的一切重型车辆无法在这条公路上行驶。在这以前几天，敌人曾极力设法修复这条公路，但是往往通车几小时后就被切断。从十七日到二十日接连四天晚上，解放武装力量就曾在这条公路上挖了六十多条壕沟，爆炸了五颗威力很大的地雷。
    解放武装力量二十四日还在西贡西南五十公里的一条运河上炸沉敌人一艘载运三百吨水泥的船只，使这条运河的交通中断。
    新华社河内二十三日电　在西贡外围的嘉定—堤岸地区，越南南方解放武装力量频频地猛烈打击美伪军，使敌人企图“绥靖”这个地区、保护它们的老巢西贡的阴谋遭到破产。
    据越南南方解放通讯社报道：从六月初到七月十二日的四十多天内，这两个省的军民共消灭敌人二千多名，其中包括美国侵略军一千三百多名，击毁击伤坦克和装甲车一百一十多辆，击落击伤敌机二十二架，击沉击伤舰艇九艘，击毁大炮三门。
    六月十九日，嘉定省芽?县军民在求京地区和西贡南面一些乡粉碎了美国第九步兵师和伪军十一个营的“扫荡”，消灭敌人六百五十多名，其中包括美国侵略军四百多名，击落敌机五架，击沉登陆艇五艘。从七月二日到六日，旭门县军民在中安地区进行反“扫荡”，又消灭美国侵略军近百名，击落敌机五架，击沉登陆艇三艘。
    古芝县游击队在反击敌人大规模的“扫荡”战斗中，共击毁敌人坦克和装甲车五十二辆，消灭美国侵略军三百多名，其中全歼美军一个步兵连。
    堤岸省边沥等县的游击队，从六月十日到十七日接连袭击四号公路上的美军驻地和进行反“扫荡”，共消灭敌人一百六十二名，其中包括美国侵略军一百一十九名，击毁装甲车二辆。七月十二日，堤岸和西宁省的游击队紧密配合，英勇截击在两省交界地区进行“扫荡”的敌军，消灭美军一百五十名，击落直升飞机六架。
