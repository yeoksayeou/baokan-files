	Warmly responding to Chairman Ho Chi Minh's great call, the Vietnamese people have shot down more than 2,100 American planes.

	According to Xinhua News Agency in Hanoi, just as the military and civilians in North and South Vietnam were warmly commemorating the first anniversary of Chairman Ho Chi Minh's call to resist America and save the nation on July 17 last year, the northern military and civilians achieved the great victory of shooting down the 2,100th American aggressor plane.

	On the 16th, the military and civilians of Nam Ha Province shot down one enemy plane, which was the 2,100th American plane shot down since the U.S. aggressors brazenly bombed North Vietnam on August 5, 1964. Before this, on the 13th, the military and civilians of Nghe An Province shot down one enemy plane.

	On the day after achieving the victory of shooting down the 2,100th enemy plane, on the 17th, the military and civilians of Thanh Hoa Province and Bac Ninh Province continued their victories, each shooting down one enemy plane.
