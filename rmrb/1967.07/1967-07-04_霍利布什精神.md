"The Spirit of Hollybush"

The head of the Soviet revisionist clique, Kosygin, recently visited the United States to pay homage to the leader of American imperialism, Johnson. They secretly met twice on June 23 and 25 at the residence of the president of Glassboro College in New Jersey, named "Hollybush," for lengthy discussions, engaging in a global counterrevolutionary conspiracy.

In 1959, after Khrushchev and former U.S. President Eisenhower met at the presidential retreat Camp David, the Soviet revisionist clique had widely touted the so-called "Spirit of Camp David." This time, after Kosygin's talks with Johnson, both sides are again touting the so-called "Spirit of Hollybush." Whether it is the "Spirit of Camp David" or the "Spirit of Hollybush," it all means that the two superpowers, the U.S. and the Soviet Union, are colluding in a shameful alliance, mutually conspiring against communism, against China, against the people, and against revolution.

The Camp David talks marked the beginning of the shameful history of the Soviet and American collusion in openly opposing the world revolution.

The Hollybush talks signify that the Soviet revisionist clique has completely bowed down to American imperialism, playing a supporting role in the counterrevolutionary "Holy Alliance" with American imperialism as the leader.

　　“霍利布什精神”
    苏修集团头目柯西金不久前亲自到美国登门朝拜美帝国主义的头子约翰逊。他们鬼鬼祟祟地在六月二十三日和二十五日，在美国新泽西州的葛拉斯堡罗大学校长鲁宾逊的一所叫作“霍利布什”的住宅里，举行了两次秘密长谈，进行全球性的反革命大勾结。
    一九五九年，赫鲁晓夫和前美国总统艾森豪威尔在美国总统别墅戴维营会谈后，苏修集团曾大肆宣扬所谓“戴维营精神”。这次，柯西金同约翰逊会谈后，双方又在高唱所谓“霍利布什精神”。无论是“戴维营精神”，还是“霍利布什精神”，都意味着美苏两霸狼狈为奸，相互勾结反共、反华、反人民、反革命。
    戴维营会谈是苏美公开合伙反对世界革命的罪恶历史的开端。
    霍利布什会谈则标志着苏美反革命勾结进入了一个新的阶段，苏修集团完全拜倒在美帝国主义的脚下，在以美帝国主义为盟主的反革命“神圣同盟”中充当配角。
