At this critical moment when the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution is entering a decisive battle between the two classes and the two lines, the issue of cadres is crucial. We must resolutely support revolutionary cadres to stand out, resolutely unite with the majority, and strike at a handful. This is a major issue concerning whether we can grasp the direction of the struggle and achieve the great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination. It is not a matter to be taken lightly. We must resolutely implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy and thoroughly criticize the "strike a large number, protect a few" as part of the bourgeois reactionary line.

The top capitalist-roader in the Party has, on the issue of cadres, pushed the bourgeois reactionary line of "strike a large number, protect a few." Its purpose is to suppress revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres, to protect a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists, and to protect themselves.

The top capitalist-roader in the Party has, in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, implemented the bourgeois reactionary line of "strike a large number, protect a few." This is not accidental, nor is it a matter of "old revolutionaries encountering new problems." It is a consistent practice, unrepentant. As far back as 1947, during the land reform, he slandered the rural grassroots organizations and cadres as all being bad, advocating to "move stones" and kick out many rural cadres. In the socialist education movement of 1964, he again resorted to the same old tricks, advocating the suppression of the majority of grassroots cadres and the protection of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the reactionary line of "strike a large number, protect a few" he put forward is another blatant exposure of his stubborn adherence to the bourgeois reactionary stance.

The broad revolutionary masses and revolutionary cadres have increasingly recognized the evil intentions of the top capitalist-roader in the Party in implementing the bourgeois reactionary line. They have risen up to expose and criticize. Many cadres have stood out and joined the great tide of the mass revolutionary movement. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line and a great victory for Chairman Mao's cadre policy.

Chairman Mao personally presided over the formulation of the Sixteen Points, which emphasize that, in general, good and relatively good cadres are the majority, and anti-Party, anti-socialist rightists are a small number. The practice of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution over the past year has proven that the majority of our cadres support Chairman Mao, support Mao Zedong Thought, and support socialism. Those who have infiltrated the Party as counter-revolutionary revisionists are only a handful.

We must be good at identifying cadres, making a comprehensive and historical assessment of them. Chairman Mao said: "We must not only look at a cadre's actions at a particular time, but also at his entire history and all his work. This is the main method of identifying cadres." We must distinguish between major and minor issues for cadres. First, we must pay attention to major issues, seeing whether they support Chairman Mao, whether they emphasize proletarian politics, and whether they have revolutionary spirit. For cadres who are good or basically good in major issues but have many shortcomings and errors in minor issues, we must also resolutely support them to stand out and support them to participate in the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination temporary power organs.

Chairman Mao has always taught us to believe in and rely on the majority of cadres, gradually uniting more than ninety-five percent of the cadres, uniting all possible cadres. For cadres who have made mistakes, even serious mistakes, we do not strike them down with one blow, but adopt the policy of "punishing the past to educate the future, curing the sickness to save the patient," and "unity-criticism-unity." Chairman Mao said: "For those party members and cadres who have made mistakes but can still be educated, and who are different from those who cannot be saved, no matter what their origin, they should all be educated, not abandoned." The proletarian revolutionary masses must distinguish between "a large number" and "a handful," dare to approach cadres who have made mistakes, patiently and enthusiastically help them correct their mistakes, unite the majority, and strike at the handful, resolutely implementing Chairman Mao's cadre policy.

At present, there are some erroneous understandings and practices regarding how to deal with revolutionary cadres.

"Protecting the wrong person is a big problem, striking the wrong person is nothing serious." This is a statement without political principles. In their view, the more cadres are struck down, the stronger the revolution is. Whether to support or strike down leading cadres is a serious political issue. The proletarian revolutionary masses must be responsible for the proletarian revolutionary cause, treating both support and striking down seriously, not acting rashly.

Revolutionary leading cadres must be protected by the proletarian revolutionary masses. They have undergone long-term tests of struggle and are a precious asset of our Party and state. Protecting revolutionary leading cadres is supporting their revolutionary actions, not protecting their shortcomings and errors. Their shortcomings and errors must, of course, be subjected to serious criticism and help. However, they must not be struck down just because they have this or that shortcoming or error.

The revolutionary spirit of the proletariat is not only manifested in daring to strike down a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party but also in daring to support revolutionary leading cadres to stand out. "Thorough materialists are fearless." For revolutionary leading cadres, we must, with great courage, resolutely and unambiguously give them support.

One cannot talk about "protection" and "revolution" without a class standpoint. If you stand on the proletarian standpoint, you must definitely protect revolutionary leading cadres and resolutely oppose a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; if you stand on the bourgeois standpoint, you must definitely oppose the proletarian leaders and protect the bourgeois leaders. Not daring to protect revolutionary leading cadres means not being able to thoroughly oppose a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party. This is an objective law of class struggle. The practice of striking down everything without class analysis is not the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat but a manifestation of petty-bourgeois anarchism.

"Cadres must take sides." Taking sides means siding with Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. However, some people's notion of taking sides is not this meaning. They use whether a cadre sides with their faction as a criterion for distinguishing whether they are revolutionary. Those who side with their faction are revolutionary cadres, and their mistakes are all covered up; those who do not side with their faction are criticized for minor faults and not let go. This is wrong.

We should distinguish whether a cadre is revolutionary and whether they should be struck down, not based on factional principles, but based on proletarian political principles. We should see whether they support Chairman Mao or oppose Chairman Mao, whether they stand on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line or stubbornly adhere to the bourgeois reactionary line.

To thoroughly criticize the bourgeois reactionary line on the issue of cadres and unconditionally implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, we must study and apply Chairman Mao's works, arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, eliminate private interests, and establish a proletarian worldview. Only by getting rid of private thoughts can we prioritize revolutionary interests, objectively deal with cadres, not substitute policy with personal feelings; only then can we adhere to principles, correctly implement Chairman Mao's cadre policy, dare to liberate "a large number," and dare to support revolutionary leading cadres to stand out. If personal interests come first, with many worries, those who should be protected are not dared to be protected, or if one is self-righteous and stubborn, those who should be supported are not supported, these are all wrong.

All revolutionary cadres must bravely stand out, expose and criticize a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party; they must get rid of private thoughts, not fear being distrusted by the masses, not fear being criticized, not fear being "attacked"; they must actively participate in the heated mass struggle, temper themselves, reform themselves, breathe with the broad revolutionary masses, share their fate, and achieve new merits and labor in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Under the great red banner of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, the broad revolutionary masses and the broad revolutionary cadres must unite, thoroughly smash the bourgeois reactionary line of "strike a large number, protect a few" on the issue of cadres, achieve and consolidate the great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination, and jointly strive for new victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    坚决支持革命干部站出来
    洪晓斌
    在无产阶级文化大革命进入两个阶级、两条路线决战的关键时刻，在干部问题上，坚决支持革命干部站出来，坚决团结大多数，打击一小撮，这是关系到能不能掌握斗争大方向，实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”的重大问题，这是不能等闲视之的。我们必须坚决执行毛主席的干部政策，彻底批判“打击一大片，保护一小撮”这个资产阶级反动路线的组成部分。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在干部问题上，推行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，其目的，就是为了镇压革命群众和革命干部，保护一小撮反革命修正主义分子，保护他们自己。
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，在无产阶级文化大革命中实行“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，决不是偶然的，决不是什么“老革命遇到了新问题”，而是一贯如此，屡教不改。远在一九四七年的土地改革中，他就污蔑农村基层组织和干部都坏了，要“搬石头”，把许多农村干部一脚踢开。他在一九六四年的社会主义教育运动中，又重施故伎，主张打击多数基层干部，保护党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。在无产阶级文化大革命中，他抛出的“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的反动路线，是他顽固坚持资产阶级反动立场的又一次大暴露。
    对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派实行资产阶级反动路线的罪恶目的，广大革命群众和革命干部认识得越来越清楚了。他们纷纷起来揭发、批判。许多干部站出来，投入到群众革命运动的伟大洪流中去。这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的重大胜利，是毛主席的干部政策的重大胜利。
    毛主席亲自主持制订的十六条中强调指出：在一般情况下，好的比较好的干部是大多数，反党反社会主义的右派分子是少量的。一年多来轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命的实践证明，我们大多数干部是拥护毛主席，拥护毛泽东思想，拥护社会主义的。钻进党内来的反革命修正主义分子只是一小撮。
    我们要善于识别干部，对干部作全面的了解和历史的考察。毛主席说：“不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”对干部要分清大节和小节。首先要注重大节，看他是不是拥护毛主席，是不是突出无产阶级政治，是不是有革命干劲。有的干部，大节是好的或者基本上好的，但也有不少缺点和错误，小节不那么好，对这种干部，我们也要坚决支持他站出来，拥护他参加革命的“三结合”的临时权力机构。
    毛主席历来教导我们，要相信和依靠干部的大多数，逐步团结百分之九十五以上的干部，团结一切可以团结的干部。对于犯了错误甚至犯了严重错误的干部，也不是一棍子打死，而是采取“惩前毖后、治病救人”、“团结——批评——团结”的方针。毛主席说：“对于那些犯了错误但是还可以教育的、同那些不可救药的分子有区别的党员和干部，不论其出身如何，都应当加以教育，而不是抛弃他们。”无产阶级革命派要分清“一大片”和“一小撮”，敢于接近犯错误的干部，耐心地、热情地帮助他们改正错误，团结大多数，打击一小撮，坚决贯彻毛主席的干部政策。
    目前，在如何对待革命干部问题上，流传着一些错误的认识和做法。
    “保错了是大问题，打错了没有什么了不起。”这是一种没有政治原则的说法。在他们看来，打倒的干部越多，革命性就越强。对领导干部，是支持还是打倒，这是一个严肃的政治问题。无产阶级革命派要对无产阶级革命事业负责，不论是支持，还是打倒，都要认真地对待，不要草率从事。
    革命的领导干部，无产阶级革命派就是要保。他们经过长期的斗争考验，是我们党和国家的宝贵财富。保护革命的领导干部，是支持他们的革命行动，不是保护他们的缺点错误。对于他们的缺点错误，当然要进行严肃的批评和帮助。但是，决不能因为他们有这样那样的缺点错误，就要把他们打倒。
    无产阶级的革命造反精神，不但表现在敢于打倒党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，而且也表现在敢于支持革命领导干部站出来。“彻底的唯物主义者是无所畏惧的”。对于革命的领导干部，就是要以大无畏的勇敢精神，坚决地、毫不含糊地给予支持。
    不能离开阶级立场来谈“保”和“革”。你站在无产阶级立场，就一定保护革命领导干部，坚决反对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派；你站在资产阶级立场，就一定反对无产阶级的当权派，而保护资产阶级的当权派。不敢保护革命领导干部，就不能彻底反对党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。这是阶级斗争的客观规律。那种不作阶级分析，打倒一切的做法，决不是无产阶级革命造反精神，而是小资产阶级无政府主义的表现。
    “干部亮相必须一边倒。”一边倒，就是倒向毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。但是，现在有些人所说的一边倒，并不是这个意思。他们以干部是不是倒向我这个山头一边，作为区别是不是革命的标志。凡是倒向我这个山头的，就是革命干部，有错误也统统替他包下来；不倒向我这个山头的，就尽量抓小辫子，揪住就不放。这是错误的。
    我们区别一个干部是不是革命的，应该不应该打倒，不是根据宗派的原则，而是根据无产阶级的政治原则。要看他是拥护毛主席，还是反对毛主席，是站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，还是顽固地坚持资产阶级反动路线。
    要彻底批判干部问题上的资产阶级反动路线，不折不扣地执行毛主席的干部政策，必须活学活用毛主席著作，用毛泽东思想武装头脑，破私立公，改造资产阶级世界观，树立无产阶级世界观。只有去掉了私心杂念，才能以革命利益为重，实事求是地对待干部，不以感情代替政策；才能坚持原则，正确执行毛主席的干部政策，勇于解放“一大片”，敢于支持革命的领导干部站出来。如果私字当头，顾虑重重，该保的不敢保，或者自以为是，固执己见，该支持的不支持，这都是不对的。
    一切革命干部，要勇敢地站出来，揭露和批判党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派；要去掉私心杂念，不要怕群众不信任，不要怕抓辫子，不要怕“围攻”；要积极投身到火热的群众斗争中，锻炼自己，改造自己，同广大革命群众同呼吸，共命运，在无产阶级文化大革命中建新功，立新劳。
    在战无不胜的毛泽东思想的伟大红旗下，广大革命群众同广大革命干部团结起来，彻底粉碎在干部问题上“打击一大片，保护一小撮”的资产阶级反动路线，实现和巩固革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，为夺取无产阶级文化大革命的新胜利而共同战斗！
