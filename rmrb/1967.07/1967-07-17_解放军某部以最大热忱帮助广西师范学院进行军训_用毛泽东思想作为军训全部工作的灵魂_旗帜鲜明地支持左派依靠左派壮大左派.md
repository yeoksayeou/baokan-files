The 6955 unit of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, in enthusiastic response to the great call of Chairman Mao Zedong, has assisted Guangxi Normal College with military and political training with the utmost enthusiasm and initiative, achieving great success.

During the military training, the unit's officers and soldiers took Mao Zedong Thought as the soul of all military training work, and firmly supported the proletarian revolutionary faction from a political and ideological standpoint. Together with revolutionary students and teachers, they combined local and departmental situations to severely criticize the capitalist roaders within the Party who hold power and their reactionary bourgeois line. They helped revolutionary students and teachers use Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party" as weapons to break down private interests and establish public interests, to carry out a revolution in the depths of their souls. This effectively promoted the great alliance of revolutionaries and laid a solid foundation for the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," training a vigorous and united revolutionary army. The entire school presented a lively and revolutionary new atmosphere. As Chairman Mao said, "Training makes a big difference."

Revolutionary students and teachers regarded this military and political training as the greatest care and support from Chairman Mao for the proletarian revolutionary faction. Many people, with tears in their eyes, said, "Such military training is unforgettable for life." When the unit completed its military training mission and left the school, revolutionary students and teachers turned out en masse, forming a queue several li long, all the way to the unit's barracks.

Why was this military training so warmly welcomed by revolutionary students and teachers? Recently, the 6955 unit of the People's Liberation Army made a summary. Their experience is as follows:

(1) To carry out military training well and do support-left work, one must first have leftist thinking. Only by being infinitely loyal to the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao can one truly sit on the same bench with the leftists, heart to heart, study together, and fight side by side.

Before the military training, many officers and soldiers of this unit knew little about the local cultural revolution situation, and some comrades lacked sensory knowledge of the struggle between the two lines. The military training task entrusted by Chairman Mao was of great importance. It concerned the in-depth development of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and the growth of successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause. What should be done? Before the officers and soldiers entered the school, the unit's leadership analyzed their strengths and weaknesses. Their strength was that the People's Liberation Army, created by Chairman Mao and led by Deputy Commander Lin Biao, held high the red flag of Mao Zedong Thought and actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works to carry out ideological revolutionization. Their weakness was that they lacked understanding and deep recognition of the cultural revolution struggle situation, easily relying on old experience and old frameworks. To win this battle of military training, the leadership first conducted investigations and research, organizing cadres to go to the school to understand in detail the struggle history of the leftist organization "Old Many" in Guilin since the cultural revolution and the current situation of the struggle between the two lines. Then, based on these situations, they organized all officers and soldiers participating in the military training to study seriously and repeatedly. Through pre-battle training, all officers and soldiers, before entering the school, approached the leftists in thought and stood firmly on the side of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line. Entering the school and going into battle, they were clear-headed, aimed accurately, and supported the leftists firmly.

(2) To support the leftists, one must be clear-cut and unambiguous.

"Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is the primary question of revolution." When the unit's comrades entered the school, their primary task was to support whom, win over whom, and strike whom. The officers and soldiers, following Chairman Mao's teaching, "We must uphold the truth, and the truth must be clear-cut," clearly expressed their firm support for the leftists with their words and deeds as soon as they entered the school. This greatly boosted the morale of the proletarian revolutionary faction and dispelled some of their unnecessary concerns, making them enter the military training with unshakable confidence.

In supporting the leftists, the officers and soldiers believed that it was necessary to use the method of class analysis to view problems and not to be careless. The general direction of the struggle of the proletarian revolutionary faction was always correct. They might have this or that mistake in the struggle, but these secondary issues should not negate the main trend. Absolutely, we must not let conservative forces suppress the leftists under the pretext of rectification. In dealing with the mistakes of the proletarian revolutionary faction, we must follow Chairman Mao's teaching, "We must truly stand on the side of the people and speak with the enthusiasm of protecting and educating the people," to persist in persuasion and education, to guide step by step, and let the masses educate themselves. We must not scold, pick on minor faults, or publicly name names. As a result, the leftist students and teachers generally reflected that the more the PLA affirmed our general direction and displayed our achievements, the more we felt our own shortcomings and mistakes, the higher our fighting spirit became, and the greater our determination to correct mistakes became. In short, all activities in military training were carried out through the leftists, relying on the leftists, and always starting from the development and strengthening of the leftist forces.

(3) Military training must be closely linked with the cultural revolution, with political and ideological training as the center, to promote the cultural revolution.

Military training is for the revolution, and military training must be closely centered around the cultural revolution to achieve the purpose of promoting the cultural revolution, making military training a "refueling station" in the march of the cultural revolution and a "training ground" in the battle.

When the officers and soldiers first entered the school, the leftist organizations were engaged in "internal warfare," becoming an obstacle to the in-depth development of the school's cultural revolution. The officers and soldiers concentrated their efforts to guide them to study Chairman Mao's brilliant works such as "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party" and "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," through open rectification, stopping the "internal warfare," and gradually bringing the revolution back on track. This military training was carried out when the leftist organization "Old Many" in Guangxi Normal College was continuously strengthening and the conservative forces were gradually disintegrating. Some leftists had developed various anarchist tendencies, and their awareness of the struggle between the two lines had become weak. Based on this situation, the military training team organized them to study Chairman Mao's "Analysis of the Classes in Chinese Society," guiding everyone to recognize the sharpness, complexity, and seriousness of class struggle. Then, they organized everyone to use their own battle experiences to denounce the crimes of the bourgeois reactionary line. Through the denunciation meeting, the leftist students and teachers recalled the days of white terror, when they fearlessly sacrificed everything to defend Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, overcoming countless difficulties to strive for victory. They immediately became more determined, deciding to bravely advance against greater waves. Those students and teachers who had been deceived by the bourgeois reactionary line, through the denunciation by the leftists, increasingly recognized the ugly face of the bourgeois reactionary line. In the meeting, they painfully examined their mistakes and decided to return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, fighting together with the proletarian revolutionary faction.

The torrent of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution surges forward daily. Military training must advance in conjunction with the overall revolutionary situation. When Peng Zhen's article "Love the Country or Sell the Country?" was published, it sounded the bugle for launching a general offensive against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. The officers and soldiers immediately organized the students and teachers to study this important article, held a denunciation meeting, and held a demonstration march, launching a mass movement across the entire school to concentrate firepower, launch a general offensive, pursue and attack relentlessly, and thoroughly uproot the reactionary revisionist clique's rear base, pushing the struggle between the two lines to a deeper stage.

(4) Relying on the masses and letting the masses educate themselves is the fundamental guarantee for carrying out military training well.

The officers and soldiers believed that the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution could achieve such brilliant results because, under Chairman Mao's wise leadership, the masses of the people were mobilized. Without a mass movement, there would be no Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. Without a mass movement, military training work could not be carried out well. Chairman Mao said, "The masses are the real heroes, while we ourselves are often childish and laughable." If, in military training, only a few people make plans behind closed doors and act on behalf of the masses, treating the masses as puppets, this can only make military training cold and desolate.

In military training, they not only did work for the leftists through the mass line but also did work for conservatives through the mass line. All work was done through the mass line. They achieved mass participation in military training leadership, mass formulation of plans, mass self-education, and mass summarization of experience. The entire school established a military training joint leadership committee, and the departments established military training joint leadership groups, composed of military cadres and revolutionary student and teacher representatives, responsible for overall leadership work. In the later stage of military training, to better cultivate and temper revolutionary students and teachers, military cadres withdrew to the second line, allowing revolutionary students and teachers to lead the military training work themselves.

Because the officers and soldiers consulted the masses on every matter, respected the masses' pioneering spirit, and humbly learned from the masses, many complex and arduous problems were solved smoothly. When they first entered the school, there was a disagreement between the military and revolutionary students and teachers regarding the training objects. Some revolutionary masses disagreed with the participation of leading cadres and conservative organization members, believing that the active thoughts of the revolutionary faction could not be spoken to those in power and conservatives. Regarding this, the military training team did not rush to issue "instructions" but went to the masses, patiently explaining Chairman Mao's instructions on military training. They believed that Chairman Mao's words had the greatest power, one sentence was worth ten thousand, as long as Mao Zedong Thought was propagated to the hearts of the masses, there was nothing that revolutionary masses could not understand. Through self-education by the masses, they universally and deeply realized that those concerns were actually caused by the "private" character. Whether one could be a pioneer in breaking down private interests and establishing public interests was, in the new situation of the in-depth development of the cultural revolution, the touchstone for judging whether an organization was truly revolutionary or not. To achieve the broadest revolutionary alliance with the leftists as the core, all the broad masses of the school should be mobilized, and in the military training, a vast and disciplined revolutionary army should be gradually formed. As a result, 98% of the school's personnel participated in the military and political training.

(5) Always setting an example is the best method for carrying out military training well.

The power of examples is boundless. In military training, the officers and soldiers of the military training team, together with revolutionary students and teachers, used Chairman Mao's "Old Three Articles" and "On Correcting Mistaken Ideas in the Party" as weapons to seize the power of the "private" character in their minds. The comrades of the unit also, with their revolutionary, scientific, and organized and disciplined exemplary actions, helped revolutionary students and teachers overcome anarchist and small-groupist non-proletarian thoughts. Team Leader Zhang Ticheng, in the meeting on the practical use of Chairman Mao's works, took the lead in exposing his thoughts and setting an example of breaking down private interests and establishing public interests. The exemplary actions of the officers and soldiers were seen by the broad revolutionary students and teachers, remembered in their hearts, and learned in their actions. The revolutionary youngsters said, "For the revolution, Comrade Zhang, the team leader, dares to expose his thoughts and fight private interests in public. What ugly things do we have that we cannot expose to the public?" Everyone expressed their determination to learn from the PLA, to actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, to carry out a revolution in the depths of their souls, to completely, thoroughly, and cleanly sweep the "private" character out of the door, and to deeply plant Mao Zedong Thought in their minds.

    解放军某部以最大热忱帮助广西师范学院进行军训
    用毛泽东思想作为军训全部工作的灵魂
    旗帜鲜明地支持左派依靠左派壮大左派
    新华社南宁十六日电  中国人民解放军六九五五部队，热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席的伟大号召，以最大的热忱，最高的积极性，帮助广西师范学院进行军政训练，取得了很大成绩。
    军训期间，这个部队的指战员把毛泽东思想做为军训全部工作的灵魂，坚持从政治思想上支持无产阶级革命派。他们同革命师生一起，结合本地区、本部门的情况，狠批了党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和他们所提出的资产阶级反动路线；帮助革命师生以毛主席的《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作为武器，破私立公，在灵魂深处闹革命，有力地促进了革命的大联合，为革命的“三结合”打下了牢固的基础，训练出一支斗志昂扬、步伐一致的坚强的革命大军，全校呈现出一派生气勃勃、热气腾腾的革命新气象。完全如伟大领袖毛主席所说：“训练一下和不训练大不一样。”
    广大革命师生把这次军政训练，看成是伟大领袖毛主席对无产阶级革命派最大的关怀，最大的支持。许多人激动得含着泪花说：“这样的军训，终生难忘。”当部队完成军训任务离开学校时，革命师生倾校出动，排成一两里长的队伍，一直把指战员送到驻地。
    为什么这次军训受到广大革命师生如此的欢迎？最近，人民解放军六九五五部队进行了总结。他们的体会是：
    （一）要搞好军训，做好支左工作，首先自己要具有左派的思想。只有自己无限忠于以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线，才能真正和左派坐到一条板凳上，心连着心，一起学习，并肩战斗。
    这支部队许多指战员在军训前，对地方文化大革命情况了解得很少，有些同志对两条路线的斗争还缺乏感性知识。毛主席交给的军训任务事关重大，它关系着无产阶级文化大革命的深入发展，关系着无产阶级革命事业接班人的成长。怎么办？这个部队领导机关在指战员进校前，领导大家认真分析了自己的长处和不足之处。长处是毛主席亲手缔造的人民解放军在林彪副统帅的领导下，毛泽东思想红旗举得高，活学活用毛主席著作，进行思想革命化好；不足的是，对文化大革命斗争形势了解不足，认识不深，容易凭老经验、旧框框办事。为了打好军训这一仗，领导机关首先做调查研究，组织干部到学校详细了解左派组织桂林“老多”从文化大革命以来的斗争历史和当前两条路线斗争的情况，然后根据这些情况，组织参加军训的全体指战员认真研究，反复学习。通过战前练兵，全体指战员在未进学校以前就从思想上靠近了左派，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边。开进学校，打起仗来，心明眼亮，目标准，支持左派坚定。
    （二）支持左派，必须旗帜鲜明，毫不含糊。
    “谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题。”部队同志一进学校，面临的首要任务是支持谁，争取谁，打击谁。指战员们按照毛主席“我们必须坚持真理，而真理必须旗帜鲜明”的教导，进校后就用自己的言行反复地表明坚决支持左派，大长了无产阶级革命派的志气，消除了他们一些不必要的顾虑，使他们信心百倍地投入军训。
    在支持左派中，指战员们认为，务必注意用阶级分析的方法看待问题，决不可粗心大意。无产阶级革命派斗争的大方向始终是正确的，他们在斗争中可能会有这样或那样的缺点错误，但决不能因为这些支流而否定了主流，绝不能让保守势力借整风之机压抑左派。对待无产阶级革命派的缺点错误，必须按照毛主席“必须是真正站在人民的立场上，用保护人民、教育人民的满腔热情来说话”的教导，坚持说服教育，循循善诱，让群众自己教育自己。做到不训斥，不抓小辫子，不公开点名。这样做的结果，左派师生普遍反映，解放军越肯定我们的大方向，越摆我们的成绩，我们就越感到自己存在的缺点和错误，斗志越来越高，改正错误的决心也就越来越大。总之，军训中的一切活动，都是通过左派，依靠左派，处处从发展壮大左派的力量出发。
    （三）军训必须紧密结合文化大革命，以政治思想训练为中心，促进文化大革命。
    军训是为了革命，军训必须紧密围绕文化大革命来进行，达到促进文化大革命的目的，使军训成为文化大革命进军途中的“加油站”，战斗途中的“练兵场”。
    指战员们初进学校，左派的组织正在打“内战”，成了学校文化大革命深入开展的阻碍。指战员们就集中力量引导他们学习毛主席《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等光辉著作，通过开门整风，制止了“内战”，使革命逐渐走上了正轨。这次军训是在广西师范学院左派组织“老多”的力量不断壮大，保守势力趋于瓦解的情况下进行的。左派中部分人滋长了各种无政府主义倾向，两条路线斗争的观念有些淡薄。根据这个情况，军训团就组织他们学习毛主席的《中国社会各阶级的分析》，引导大家认识阶级斗争的尖锐性、复杂性和严重性。然后，又组织大家以本身的战斗经历，控诉资产阶级反动路线的罪行。左派师生通过控诉会，想起在白色恐怖的日子里，为了捍卫毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，不怕牺牲，排除万难，去争取胜利的情景。他们顿时斗志倍增，决心迎着更大的风浪奋勇前进。过去被资产阶级反动路线蒙蔽的师生，通过左派的控诉，越发认清了资产阶级反动路线的丑恶面目，在会上沉痛地检查了自己的错误，决心回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，同无产阶级革命派共同战斗。
    无产阶级文化大革命的洪流一日千里，军训必须和整个革命形势结合前进。戚本禹同志的《爱国主义还是卖国主义？》发表，吹响了向党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派发起总攻击的号角，指战员们立即组织师生学习这篇重要文章，召开了声讨大会，举行了示威游行，在全校掀起了一个集中火力，发动总攻，穷追猛打，彻底挖掉反革命修正主义分子总后台的群众运动，把两条路线的斗争推向更深的阶段。
    （四）依靠群众，让群众自己教育自己，是搞好军训的根本保证。
    指战员们认为，文化大革命，所以能够取得如此辉煌的成果，就是由于在毛主席的英明领导下，把亿万人民发动起来了。没有群众运动，便没有无产阶级文化大革命。没有群众运动，也就不可能搞好军训工作。毛主席说：“群众是真正的英雄，而我们自己则往往是幼稚可笑的”。如果在军训中只凭少数人闭门搞计划，包办代替，把群众当成阿斗，这只能把军训搞得冷冷清清。
    在军训中，他们不仅做左派的工作靠走群众路线，就是做保守派的工作也靠走群众路线，一切工作都是靠走群众路线。做到群众参与军训领导，群众制定计划，群众教育自己，群众总结经验。全校成立军训联合领导委员会，系里成立军训联合领导小组，由军队各级干部和革命师生代表联合组成，负责全盘的领导工作。军训后期，为了更好地培养锻炼革命师生，部队干部退居二线，让革命师生自己领导军训工作。
    由于指战员们遇事找群众商量，尊重群众的首创精神，虚心当群众的小学生，很多复杂而艰巨的问题都迎刃而解。刚入校时，关于集训对象，军队和革命师生产生了分歧，一部分革命群众不同意领导干部和保守组织成员参加，认为革命派的活思想不能讲给当权派、保守派听。对此，军训团没有急于下“指示”，而是到群众中去，耐心地向群众宣传毛主席关于军训的指示。他们认为，毛主席的话威力最大，一句顶一万句，只要把毛泽东思想宣传到群众的心里，革命群众没有想不通的事。经过群众自我教育，普遍深刻地认识到，过去那些顾虑其实都是“私”字作怪，能不能做破私立公的闯将，在当前文化大革命深入发展的新形势下，是衡量一个组织是真革命还是假革命的试金石。为了实现以左派为核心的最广泛的革命大联合，应把全校广大群众动员起来，在军训中逐步形成一支浩浩荡荡的有组织有纪律的革命大军。结果，全校百分之九十八的人员参加了军政训练。
   （五）时时处处作样板，是搞好军训的最好方法。
    榜样的力量是无穷的。在军训中军训团的指战员既和革命师生共同以毛主席的“老三篇”和《关于纠正党内的错误思想》等光辉著作为武器，夺自己头脑中“私”字的权，部队同志又以自己的革命性、科学性、组织纪律性的榜样行动，帮助革命师生克服无政府主义、小团体主义等非无产阶级思想。团长张体成在活学活用毛主席著作讲用会上，带头亮思想，作破私立公的榜样。指战员的模范行动，广大革命师生看在眼里，记在心上，学在行动上。革命小将们说：“张团长为了革命，敢于在大庭广众面前亮思想，斗私心，我们还有什么丑东西不可以公之于众呢！”大家纷纷表示，决心象解放军一样，活学活用毛主席著作，在灵魂深处闹革命，把“私”字完全、彻底、干净地扫地出门，让毛泽东思想在头脑中深深地扎下根。
