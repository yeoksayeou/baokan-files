In the midst of the great victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary factions of the financial and trade system of the State Council, filled with revolutionary enthusiasm and the joy of victory, jointly held a grand meeting of ten thousand people at the Great Hall of the People on July 5 to solemnly commemorate the 46th anniversary of the founding of the Communist Party of China.

Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Li Xiannian attended the meeting.

At the meeting, Premier Zhou Enlai, on behalf of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade-in-arms Vice Chairman Lin Biao, on behalf of the State Council and the Central Cultural Revolution Group, extended greetings to the revolutionary factions of the proletariat present. He said: "Today, you have come together to hold a meeting to celebrate the Party's birthday, and I am very pleased. I hope that through today's meeting, we can further promote the revolutionary great unity and the revolutionary 'three-in-one combination' in the financial and trade system. I hope that the revolutionary factions of the proletariat in the financial and trade system will hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, study the works of Chairman Mao, study the important editorials of the _Red Flag_ magazine and the _People's Daily_, and firmly grasp the direction of the struggle."

The stage of the Great Hall of the People was adorned with a large portrait of our great leader Chairman Mao. After the meeting began with the majestic song "The East is Red," the revolutionary fighters of the proletariat present read aloud together the quotations of Chairman Mao: "The core force leading our cause is the Communist Party of China. The theoretical foundation guiding our thinking is Marxism-Leninism." "Organize tens of millions of people, mobilize a surging revolutionary army, this is the need of today's revolution to attack the counter-revolution."

The representatives of the revolutionary factions of the proletariat present spoke at the meeting, enthusiastically celebrating the 46th anniversary of the founding of the great, glorious, and correct Communist Party of China, personally founded by our great leader Chairman Mao. They pointed out that the best way to commemorate the Party's birthday is, in accordance with the instructions of Vice Chairman Lin Biao, to strive to study the works of Chairman Mao, to reform the non-proletarian thoughts in our minds, and to establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds.

The representatives said that under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in the financial and trade system of the State Council has achieved one victory after another. The current situation of the struggle urgently requires the revolutionary factions of the proletariat to unite, firmly grasp the direction of the struggle, and powerfully launch a great criticism and great struggle against the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. We are united today to jointly celebrate the Party's birthday. This is a great victory of Mao Zedong Thought, and this is a good beginning for the great unity of the revolutionary factions of the proletariat in the financial and trade system of the State Council. We must press on to victory, strive for the realization of the great unity of the revolutionary factions in the financial and trade system of the State Council, and strive for the implementation of the great leader Chairman Mao's call to "grasp revolution and promote production."

The meeting adopted a message of respect to the great leader Chairman Mao. In the message of respect, the revolutionary factions of the proletariat in the financial and trade system declared to Chairman Mao: We are determined to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, strive to study the works of Chairman Mao, resolutely struggle against the "self" in our minds, quickly realize the great unity of the revolutionary factions of the proletariat in the financial and trade system and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination," deeply criticize the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road and the handful of power-holders within the financial and trade system who are taking the capitalist road, fight them down, fight them to the ground, and fight them to stink, and turn the financial and trade system into a red school of Mao Zedong Thought.

At the end of the meeting, Premier Zhou personally directed everyone to stand and sing "The Boat Needs a Helmsman" in unison. In the evening, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Li Xiannian watched the revolutionary modern Beijing opera "Attack on White Tiger Regiment" with the revolutionary factions of the proletariat in the financial and trade system who attended the meeting.
