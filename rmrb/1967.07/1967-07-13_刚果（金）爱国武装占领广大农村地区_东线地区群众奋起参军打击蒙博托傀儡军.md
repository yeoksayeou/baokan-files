Patriotic armed forces in Congo (Kinshasa) have occupied extensive rural areas. In the eastern region, the people have risen up to enlist and strike back against Mobutu's puppet army.

According to a report from the National Liberation Committee of Congo (Kinshasa)'s official publication *Revolution*, the patriotic armed forces in the eastern region of Congo (Kinshasa) have recently launched widespread attacks in the province of Kivu, striking against the puppet army of Mobutu, who is backed by U.S. imperialism. They have achieved great victories.

The patriotic armed forces, active in the Uvira mountain area, have repulsed the frenzied counterattacks of Mobutu's puppet army and, seizing the opportunity, have occupied the extensive rural areas of Fizi, Uvira, Muang, Kabare, Kasongo, Kibombo, and Panzi in the southern part of Kivu province.

In the Kabare region, local residents, inspired by the patriotic armed struggle, have risen up against the forced labor and heavy taxes imposed by Mobutu's puppet regime. They have resolutely resisted the puppet army sent to suppress them. According to reports, half of the population in this region has joined the patriotic armed forces to oppose the brutal rule of Mobutu's puppet regime. Similar situations have occurred in the regions of Malera, Samba, Kalondu, Wamaza, and Wamba.

The broad masses of the people of Congo (Kinshasa) harbor extreme hatred for the puppet regime of Mobutu, which serves U.S. imperialism, and hold deep affection for the revolutionaries. In the Kasendi region, local residents, under the threat of Mobutu's puppet army's bayonets, refused to reveal the whereabouts of the revolutionaries. Enraged, Mobutu's puppet army opened fire on the local residents twice, brutally killing eighty people. However, the local residents, unyielding, bravely rose up to resist the puppet army. Then, they joined the revolutionaries and went up into the mountains to wage guerrilla warfare.

    刚果（金）爱国武装占领广大农村地区
    东线地区群众奋起参军打击蒙博托傀儡军
    据新华社讯　据刚果（金）全国解放委员会机关刊物《革命》的一则消息报道，刚果（金）东线的爱国武装力量最近在基伍省广泛出击，打击美帝支持下的蒙博托伪军，取得巨大战果。
    活跃在乌维腊山区的爱国武装最近打退了蒙博托伪军的疯狂反扑后，乘胜出击，占领了基伍省南部的菲齐、乌维腊、穆昂加、卡班巴雷、卡松戈、基邦博和潘吉等这些地方的广大农村地区。
    在卡巴雷地区，当地居民在爱国武装斗争的鼓舞下，奋起反对蒙博托傀儡政权的劳役和苛捐杂税，坚决抗击前去镇压他们的蒙博托伪军。据报道，这个地区半数的群众，为了反对蒙博托傀儡政权的残暴统治，已经上山参加爱国武装部队。在马勒拉、桑巴、卡隆杜、瓦马扎和旺巴等地区也出现了类似的情况。
    广大的刚果（金）人民对为美帝效劳的蒙博托傀儡政权极端仇恨，对革命者十分热爱。在卡森迪地区，当地居民在蒙博托伪军的刺刀下拒绝说出革命者在什么地方。老羞成怒的蒙博托伪军竟两次向当地居民开枪，残暴地杀害八十人。但是，当地居民宁死不屈，英勇地起来反击伪军。然后，他们同革命者一起上山打游击去了。
