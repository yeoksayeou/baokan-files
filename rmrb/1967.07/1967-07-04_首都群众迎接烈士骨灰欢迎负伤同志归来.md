Down with U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism! Down with the Nay Win reactionary government in Burma! Blood debts must be repaid in blood!

Capital residents welcome the return of the ashes of martyrs and the wounded comrades

Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, and others, along with the first vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party, Ba Tin, welcomed the arrival at the airport. They also warmly comforted the families of the martyrs and enthusiastically embraced the victorious wounded comrades.

New China News Agency, July 3rd: "Down with the Burmese Nay Win reactionary government! The blood debt owed to the Chinese people by the Nay Win government must be repaid in blood!" Today, thousands of revolutionary masses from various sectors in the capital, filled with indignation towards the Burmese reactionary government, gathered at the capital's airport. They shouted slogans, welcoming the ashes of Liu Yi, a Chinese expert who was martyred in Burma, and warmly welcoming Cao Dalin and Zhang Ruijun, two Chinese diplomatic couriers who were injured by the Burmese reactionary government's thugs.

The ashes of Liu Yi, who was martyred in the anti-violence struggle, were flown from Kunming to Beijing today. Cao Dalin and Zhang Ruijun, who were injured in the anti-violence struggle, also returned to the capital on the same plane.

The revolutionary masses of the capital, who are advancing victoriously in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, gathered at the capital's airport today with strong revolutionary fervor. They paid tribute to the martyred Liu Yi, honored the wounded comrades, and expressed their respect to the Chinese diplomatic personnel and experts in Burma who are fighting bravely, and to the Burmese Chinese who are bravely resisting violence. They once again declared that the 700 million Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought and tempered in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, firmly support the statement of the Chinese government, firmly support the just struggle of the Burmese Chinese, and firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the Burmese people. They pointed out that the friendship between the peoples of China and Burma is indestructible. The Nay Win government, which follows the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists in their frenzied anti-China actions, will meet a bad end. They will ultimately be thrown into the dustbin of history by the revolutionary people of Burma.

Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, Chen Yi, Li Xiannian, Liu Ningyi, Yang Chengwu, Zhang Chunqiao, Guan Feng, and Chen Biyu, and other responsible comrades, went to the capital's airport today to welcome the ashes of Liu Yi and warmly welcome the victorious return of the wounded comrades.

Ba Tin, the first vice-chairman of the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party and the head of the Burmese Communist Party Central Committee delegation, and the Burmese writer Ye Gon, who are in Beijing, also went to the airport to welcome the arrivals.

Also present at the airport to welcome the arrivals were Albanian Ambassador to China Nataneli, First Secretary of the Vietnamese Embassy in China Ho Yugui, Representative of the Permanent Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam in China Li Jin, Representative of the Overseas Office of the Patriotic Front of Thailand Paron Zula Nuan, and Head of the Delegation of the Malayan National Liberation League in China Shalama, among others. The Thai and Malayan friends held up placards with the following slogans: "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with British imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with the Nay Win-led Burmese reactionary government! Support the Chinese government's statement protesting the fascist atrocities of the Burmese government! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live the great leader Chairman Mao!"

At 3:30 PM, the special plane landed at the airport. Liu Yi's family members carried Liu Yi's portrait, urn, and the blood-stained clothes he wore when he was martyred, stepping off the plane. At this moment, thousands of revolutionary masses gathered at the airport opened their red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and recited Chairman Mao's teachings in unison:

"To struggle means to sacrifice. Death is a common occurrence. But we think of the people's interests, of the sufferings of the great majority of the people. We die for the people, and our death is a death with a meaning."

"Thousands upon thousands of martyrs have heroically laid down their lives for the people's interests in front of us. Let us hold high their banner and march forward along the path of their blood!"

Ba Tin stepped forward to present a Mao badge and a bouquet of flowers to Liu Yi's family member Liu Yaxuan.

Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, and other central leaders shook hands with Liu Yi's family members and warmly comforted them.

Later, Liu Yi's ashes were escorted by his family members and revolutionary comrades as they left the airport.

Amidst the sound of drums, Zhang Ruijun, who returned in glory, held up a portrait of Chairman Mao and shouted, "Long live Chairman Mao!" as he stepped off the plane. Cao Dalin, who was seriously injured, lay on a stretcher, holding a portrait of Chairman Mao, and was carried off the plane by medical personnel. At this moment, the welcoming crowd waved red flags and shouted slogans: "Warmly welcome the victorious return of comrades who were gloriously wounded in the brave anti-violence struggle! Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, and other central leaders, holding copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao," stepped forward to shake hands with Cao Dalin and Zhang Ruijun, and warmly embraced them. Cao Dalin and Zhang Ruijun, with tears in their eyes, excitedly said, "Thank you, Chairman Mao! Thank you, Chairman Mao!"

Ba Tin also embraced Cao Dalin and Zhang Ruijun for a long time, presenting them with Mao badges and bouquets. Albanian Ambassador to China Nataneli also stepped forward to embrace Cao Dalin and Zhang Ruijun, praising them, "You are heroes, good soldiers of Chairman Mao!"

Representatives of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat stepped forward to present "Quotations from Chairman Mao" to Cao Dalin and Zhang Ruijun, and pinned Mao badges on their chests.

Then, Cao Dalin and Zhang Ruijun, accompanied by Comrades Zhou Enlai, Chen Boda, Kang Sheng, and other leaders, as well as Ba Tin and representatives of the revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the capital, walked around the airport to meet with revolutionary comrades. At this moment, the welcoming crowd waved "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and continuously shouted: "Strongly protest the fascist atrocities of the Burmese Nay Win reactionary government! Firmly support the revolutionary struggle of the Burmese people! Down with the Nay Win reactionary government! Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Long live the Communist Party of China! Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought! Long live our great leader Chairman Mao! Ten thousand years!"

Also present at the airport to welcome the arrivals were responsible comrades from various relevant departments, including Liao Chengzhi, Fang Yi, Fu Zuoyi, Luo Guibo, Han Nianlong, Li Yimang, Li Qiang, Chu Tunan, Wang Weizhen, Shen Tu, and Nie Yuanzi, as well as former Chinese Ambassador to Burma Geng Biao and representatives of red diplomats who returned victoriously from Indonesia and India.

When Liu Yi's ashes, along with Cao Dalin and Zhang Ruijun, left Kunming for Beijing this morning, more than 800 people, including responsible comrades from the Chinese People's Liberation Army stationed in Kunming, revolutionary masses of the proletariat in the Kunming region, Red Guards, PLA soldiers, returned overseas Chinese, and responsible comrades from various relevant departments, went to the airport to see them off. At the airport, the revolutionary masses of Yunnan Province, which borders Burma, raised their arms and shouted, "Down with U.S. imperialism! Down with Soviet revisionism! Down with the Nay Win reactionary government!" In recent days, the angry denunciations of the Nay Win reactionary government have thundered like a storm over the Yunnan plateau.
