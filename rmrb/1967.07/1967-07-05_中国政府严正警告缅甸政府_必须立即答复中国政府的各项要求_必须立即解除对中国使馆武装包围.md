The Chinese government solemnly warns the Burmese government that it must immediately respond to the various demands of the Chinese government and must immediately lift the armed siege of the Chinese embassy.

	NEW CHINA NEWS AGENCY, July 4th -- The responsible official of the First Asian Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China summoned Burmese Ambassador to China, Shin Wa Naung, on the 4th and solemnly pointed out: "The Burmese government has not given any response to the various demands of the Chinese government to this day, and the armed siege of the Chinese embassy in Burma by Burmese troops is still continuing. This is absolutely intolerable to the Chinese government and the Chinese people. No matter what tricks or conspiracies you play, you cannot save yourselves from failure."

	The responsible official of the First Asian Affairs Bureau emphasized: "The Chinese government solemnly warns the Burmese government, the 700 million Chinese people are not to be trifled with! The 700 million Chinese people keep their word! You must immediately respond to the various demands of the Chinese government and immediately lift the armed siege of the Chinese embassy. If you continue to delay, the Chinese government will take further necessary measures. All serious consequences arising from this must be borne by you. Do not say you were not warned!"
