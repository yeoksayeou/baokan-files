Arab countries' public opinion has widely condemned the United Nations' recent discussion on the U.S.-Israeli aggression against Arab countries, universally denouncing the UN for supporting the aggressors and pointing out that the UN is merely a tool of U.S. imperialism.

Iraq's *Jumhuriya* newspaper condemned the UN for "brazenly violating rights, inciting crime and aggression." It noted that the UN's stance on aggression is hastening its own demise.

Iraq's *Al-Arabi* newspaper stated: "The UN is a supporter of aggression, a supporter of the law of the jungle." It pointed out that the UN "specifically caters to the needs of U.S. imperialism, justifies U.S. imperialism's crimes, and supports its conspiracies against the people."

Iraq's *Al-Fajr Al-Jadid* newspaper explicitly advocated for Arab countries to withdraw from the UN. The newspaper said: "Seven hundred million Chinese people still do not have a seat in this organization, so why should Arabs want a seat? What loss would they suffer?"

*The Victory* newspaper pointed out that one cannot rely on the UN. Arab people must "rely on themselves and use armed struggle to fight for their rights."

Sudan's *Al-Ra'y* newspaper said: "The UN has become an American crime syndicate." It pointed out that Israel is a tool of the U.S., and the UN is also a tool of the U.S. The newspaper said: "We will never surrender. We will fight."

A Sudanese journalist said that he now more than ever believes that the UN is a tool of U.S. imperialism oppressing the world's people.

Another Sudanese journalist said that Arab people and people around the world now recognize the true face of their enemy. He said, "Soviet leaders told us that the UN would seek justice for us. But now it is clear that they are only using delaying tactics. They are only helping imperialism and Zionism to consolidate their gains. The Soviet leadership played this trick when they called for a ceasefire during the (U.S., Israeli) aggression."

A Sudanese friend said, "We cannot rely on the UN, but should rely on ourselves and our true friends." He emphasized that the UN is merely an institution of U.S. imperialism oppressing the world's people.

　　阿拉伯各国舆论痛斥联合国支持美以侵略
　　阿拉伯人民不能依靠美帝工具联合国
　　必须依靠自己用武装斗争去争取自己的权利
    新华社八日讯　阿拉伯各国公众舆论纷纷就联合国最近讨论美国—以色列侵略阿拉伯国家问题的情况发表评论，普遍谴责联合国支持美以侵略者，指出联合国只不过是美帝国主义的工具。
    伊拉克《共和国报》谴责联合国“肆无忌惮地破坏权利，唆使犯罪和侵略”。它指出，联合国对侵略采取这种态度，是加速自己的灭亡。
    伊拉克《阿拉伯人报》说：“联合国是侵略的支持者，弱肉强食的支持者。”它指出，联合国“专门去迎合美帝国主义的需要，为美帝国主义的罪行辩护，并支持它反对人民的阴谋。”
    伊拉克《新黎明报》明确主张阿拉伯国家退出联合国。这家报纸说：“七亿中国人民至今在这个组织中没有席位，那末，阿拉伯人也不要这个席位，对他们又有什么损失呢？”
    《胜利报》指出，不能依靠联合国。阿拉伯人民必须“依靠自己，用武装斗争来争取自己的权利。”
    苏丹《舆论报》说：“联合国已经成了美国的罪恶辛迪加。”它指出，以色列是美国的工具，联合国也是美国的工具。报纸说：“我们决不投降。我们将战斗。”
    一位苏丹新闻工作者说，他比过去任何时候更相信，联合国是美帝国主义压迫世界人民的工具。
    另一位苏丹新闻工作者说，阿拉伯人民和全世界人民现在认识了真正敌人的种种嘴脸。他说，苏联领导人“对我们说，联合国会替我们主持公道。但是现在清楚了，他们只在施展拖延战术。他们只是为了帮助帝国主义和犹太复国主义者争取时间来巩固他们的既得利益。苏联领导在（美国、以色列）侵略期间呼吁停火时已经耍过这个花招。”
    一位苏丹朋友说，我们不能依靠联合国，而应该依靠自己和真正的朋友。他强调指出，联合国不过是美帝国主义压迫世界人民的机构。
