The Cai Village Production Brigade was once a grain-deficient brigade, relying on state grain supplies every year. During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the people listened to Chairman Mao's words, and the land listened to the people's words, resulting in a bumper summer harvest this year. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants and revolutionary cadres, out of their boundless love for Chairman Mao, the Party, and the country, immediately launched a campaign to turn in and sell grain. However, when the summer grain was harvested, some individuals said, "If the members do not get a little more, it will affect their production enthusiasm," and so on. The proletarian revolutionary faction and poor and lower-middle peasants of the brigade, in response to these remarks, studied Chairman Mao's instructions. Everyone realized that this idea of getting a little more is a struggle between the public and the private, a struggle between the socialist and capitalist roads in grain distribution. After discussion, everyone drew a clear line in their minds and understood the profound significance of Chairman Mao's teaching to "start from the fact that our country has 600 million people." The entire brigade quickly launched a campaign to turn in and sell grain, completing the task ahead of schedule and exceeding the quota.

　　心中有六亿人民
    柴村大队过去是个缺粮队，历年都要国家供应粮食。在无产阶级文化大革命中，真是人听毛主席的话，地听人的话，今年获得了夏季大丰收。广大贫下中农和革命干部，出于对毛主席、对党、对国家的无限热爱，立即开展了交粮售粮活动。但是，当夏粮登场时，却有个别人说：“社员劳动一年，不多分点会影响生产情绪”，等等。大队的无产阶级革命派和贫下中农，针对这些议论学习了毛主席的指示。大家认识到，这种多分点的思想是公与私的斗争，是粮食分配中的社会主义道路和资本主义道路的斗争。经过讨论，大家思想上划清了界线，认识到毛主席教导的“都要从我国有六亿人口这一点出发”的深远意义。全队迅速掀起了交粮售粮的热潮，提前超额完成了交售任务。
