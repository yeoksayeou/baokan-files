	Beat the Fallen Dog
	Red Guards of Beijing Institute of Building Industry, August 1st Combat Team

	The Chinese Khrushchev has always been anti-party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. He is constantly trying to restore capitalism, committing heinous crimes that are too numerous to list.

	It is this Chinese Khrushchev who, in this unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, has concocted and promoted the bourgeois reactionary line, implementing bourgeois dictatorship, attempting to suppress the fiery Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

	The Eighth Plenum of the Eighth Central Committee of the Party sounded the death knell for the Chinese Khrushchev, but he is not ready to give up. He actually came to our institute bare-chested on August 2nd and 3rd last year, brutally suppressing our "August 1st" Combat Team.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "The enemy will not perish of himself. Neither the Chinese reactionaries nor the aggressive forces of American imperialism in China will withdraw from the historical stage of their own accord. Everything reactionary is the same; if you do not hit it, it will not fall." The Chinese Khrushchev and his clique are the same. Although they have been exposed, they are still alive and their hearts are not dead. They are always looking for opportunities to stage a comeback. We must carry forward the revolutionary spirit of beating the "fallen dog," thoroughly smashing the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, big and small, so that they will never be able to rise again.

	The enemy never forgets the restoration of capitalism, and we must never forget proletarian dictatorship. Otherwise, if the "fallen dog" gets back on its feet, we revolutionaries will be branded as counter-revolutionaries again, countless revolutionary comrades will lose their heads, and our proletarian dictatorship state will change color. Can we allow these bastards' plots to succeed? No, not a thousand times, not a million times! We must resolutely shoulder the great historical mission of the great criticism!

	To carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution through to the end, we proletarian revolutionaries must unite on the basis of Mao Zedong Thought, achieve great unity in the great criticism, concentrate our firepower, and give a resounding blow to the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. In the face of the great enemy, we must be models of great unity and great criticism. Let us hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, overcome petty-bourgeois thinking, strengthen our revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, launch a great wave of criticism, thoroughly criticize and expose the handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, completely eliminate their poison in all fields, let Mao Zedong Thought occupy all positions, and ensure that our proletarian iron kingdom will never change color, letting Mao Zedong Thought be passed down for generations!

    痛打落水狗
    红代会北京建筑工业学院　八一战斗团
    中国的赫鲁晓夫一贯反党反社会主义反毛泽东思想，每时每刻都在企图复辟资本主义，罪恶滔天，罄竹难书。
    就是这个中国的赫鲁晓夫，在这场史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，又炮制和推行资产阶级反动路线，实行资产阶级专政，妄图将轰轰烈烈的无产阶级文化大革命运动镇压下去。
    党的八届十一中全会敲响了中国的赫鲁晓夫的丧钟，但他贼心不死，竟然在去年八月二日和三日，赤膊上阵，来到我们学院，对我们“八一”战斗团进行残酷镇压。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们说：“敌人是不会自行消灭的。无论是中国的反动派，或是美国帝国主义在中国的侵略势力，都不会自行退出历史舞台。”“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”中国的赫鲁晓夫及其一小撮也是这样，虽然他们被揪出来了，但是他们人还在，心不死。他们还在时时刻刻窥测方向，伺机反扑。我们必须发扬痛打“落水狗”的革命精神，把党内大大小小的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派打个稀巴烂，让他们永世不得翻身。
    敌人念念不忘资本主义复辟，我们就要念念不忘无产阶级专政。否则，“落水狗”爬上岸来，我们无产阶级革命派就会重新被打成反革命，无数的革命战友就会人头落地，我们无产阶级专政的国家就会改变颜色。我们能让这些家伙的阴谋得逞吗？不能，一千个不能，一万个不能！革命的大批判的重大历史使命，我们要坚决担起来！
    为了把文化大革命进行到底，我们无产阶级革命派必须在毛泽东思想的基础上团结起来，在革命的大批判中实现革命的大联合，集中火力，狠狠打击党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。大敌当前，我们一定要做革命的大联合、大批判的模范。让我们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，克服小资产阶级思想，加强革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，掀起革命的大批判高潮，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批倒、斗臭，彻底肃清他们在各个领域里的流毒，让毛泽东思想占领一切阵地，使我们无产阶级铁打的江山永不变色，让毛泽东思想千秋万代传下去！
