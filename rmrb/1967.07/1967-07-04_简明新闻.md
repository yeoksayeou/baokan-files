	Nationalist fighters in South Yemen shoot down four British planes

	The National Liberation Front of the occupied South Yemen announced on the 2nd that since the armed uprising of South Yemen's Arab military and police and nationalists took over the Krat region of Aden, they have shot down four British colonial helicopters.

	It is reported that the nationalists in Aden continue to fight against the British colonialists in the Sheikh Othman region.

	Paris youth protest against U.S. aggression in Vietnam

	Some French youth early in the morning on the 1st wrote large slogans in red paint in front of an American church and the Thai embassy in Paris, opposing U.S. imperialism and its Thai reactionary allies' aggression against Vietnam.

	As the U.S. imperialist war of aggression against Vietnam escalates, anti-American and pro-Vietnamese people's resistance slogans appear more frequently on the streets of Paris. However, this is the first time such slogans have appeared in front of an American church and the Thai embassy in France.

	Bolivian workers and students persist in anti-dictatorship struggle

	The famous tin mines of Katavi and Vununi in Bolivia have been on strike since June 26th, continuing their struggle on the 1st, strongly protesting against the dictatorial rule and bloody suppression of the pro-American reactionary government of Barrientos.

	To protest against the reactionary authorities' bloody suppression of the miners and to support the miners' anti-suppression struggle, students of San Andres University in La Paz, the capital of Bolivia, announced on June 27th that their university was a "free territory." Following this, students of Gabriel Moreno University in Santa Cruz announced on June 29th that their university was also a "free territory." Students of this university also held a demonstration, strongly demanding that the reactionary authorities withdraw reactionary troops from the mining areas.

	Libyan workers continue strike against U.S., British, and Israeli aggression

	Port workers and oil workers in Libya continue their strike, resolutely opposing the aggression of the three countries of the U.S., Britain, and Israel. The strike by port workers in Tripoli has caused two American cargo ships, which were supposed to transport goods to the Wheeler's Air Force Base in Libya, to leave the port of Tripoli with their cargo untouched. Some British ships have sailed to Malta after Libyan port workers refused to unload their cargo.

	The port workers in Tripoli also boycotted ships and goods from another supporter of Israel—West Germany.

	The strike action by Libyan oil workers has halted the work of transporting oil from Libya to the West, mainly to West Germany (1.75 million barrels of oil are transported from Libya to the West daily). The Libyan people hate imperialism led by the United States, and their demand for cigarettes, mainly imported from the United States and Britain, has sharply decreased. Libya has stopped importing cigarettes from these two countries.
