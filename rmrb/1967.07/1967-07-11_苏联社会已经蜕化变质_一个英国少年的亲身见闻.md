Fifteen-year-old British youth Maikel is the son of a British teacher at the Beijing Foreign Languages Institute. He has been in China for less than a year, and has gone to the countryside with the teachers and students of the Foreign Languages Institute, eating, living, and working with Chinese teachers and students, and has established deep friendships. During his time in China, Maikel has been greatly inspired and influenced by the revolutionary spirit of the Chinese people, and expresses boundless love and admiration for our great leader Chairman Mao.

Recently, Maikel returned to Britain from China. On his way back, he passed through Moscow and personally witnessed the ugly phenomena of capitalist restoration under the rule of the Soviet revisionist clique. Recently, he wrote a letter to his Chinese classmates, talking about his observations and personal feelings in Moscow. Below is a summary of his letter:

Returning to Britain, I have mixed feelings. I am glad to be back home, but leaving China and my comrades in Beijing, I feel very regretful and sad.

We returned by train. After arriving in the Soviet Union, we couldn't buy tickets to Berlin and were deliberately placed in a luxurious hotel. My parents and I had to pay the equivalent of seventy-five yuan for just one night's stay. But staying in this hotel was really disgusting; it was full of all kinds of Soviet new bourgeois elements.

Every night, you could see these new bourgeois elements feasting and dancing wildly. Isn't this just like the British bourgeoisie? The women's hair was curled like screws, and they wore fur coats. But I didn't see any Soviet workers wearing fur coats. The homeland of Lenin and Stalin, the first workers' state in the world, which once defeated Hitler's mighty Red Army, has now become like this, completely degenerate!

The young people have long hair, trying to imitate Western styles. You can hear the latest popular yellow music. As we strolled down the street, a stranger came up to us and asked if we wanted to sell some dollars, pounds, or even West German marks!

Soviet society has completely degenerated. It is no longer a socialist country but a country where the new bourgeoisie has usurped power.

Although the Soviet leadership has completely betrayed the cause, the broad masses of the people will never forget their glorious revolutionary traditions. Every day, tens of thousands of Soviet working people still line up to visit Lenin's tomb. They endure the cold, standing in line at night, even in heavy snow.

The Soviet people miss the great Lenin.

    苏联社会已经蜕化变质
    ——一个英国少年的亲身见闻
    十五岁的英国少年麦克尔是北京外国语学院一位英籍教员的儿子。他在中国居留了不到一年的时间，曾经同外语学院师生一起下乡，跟中国师生同吃、同住、同劳动，建立了深厚的友谊。在中国期间，麦克尔深受中国人民革命精神的鼓舞和感染，对我们伟大领袖毛主席表示无限的热爱和敬仰。
    不久前，麦克尔从中国回到英国。在途经莫斯科的时候，他亲眼看到了在苏修领导集团统治下的苏联资本主义复辟的丑恶现象。最近他给中国同学来信，谈到了他在莫斯科的见闻和亲身感受。下面是他的来信摘要：
    回到英国，我有一种错综复杂的感情。我很高兴回到了自己家里，但是离开了中国和我在北京的同志们，我又感到十分惋惜和难受。
    我们是乘火车回国的。我们抵达苏联后，买不到去柏林的火车票，被故意安置在一个奢华的旅馆里。我跟父母在那儿过一宵就得付相当于七十五元的代价。可是住在这家旅馆里，实在是令人作呕，里边挤满了形形色色的苏联新资产阶级分子。
    每晚，可以看到这些新资产阶级分子在大吃大喝，大跳其舞。这跟英国资产阶级不是一模一样吗！妇女们的头发象螺丝般地卷起来，穿上貂皮大衣。可是我没见过任何一个苏联劳动者穿什么貂皮大衣。列宁和斯大林的故乡、世界上第一个工人阶级的国家，曾击溃过希特勒的伟大红军的祖国，今天竟然变成这样了，完全蜕化变质了！
    年青人留着满头长发，竭力去模仿西方的服装式样。你可以听到最新流行的黄色音乐。当我们沿街漫步时，一个陌生人过来问我们是否愿意卖给他一点美元，或者英镑，甚至于西德的马克也行！！
    苏联社会已经完全堕落了。它不再是一个社会主义国家，而是一个被新兴的资产阶级分子篡夺了政权的国家。
    尽管苏联领导已全然背叛，但是广大人民绝不会忘记他们的光荣的革命传统。成千成万的苏联劳动人民，每天还是排着长队去拜谒列宁墓。他们冒着严寒，在深夜里，甚至在大雪纷飞时也还在那儿排着长队。苏联人民怀念着伟大的列宁。　　　　麦克尔
