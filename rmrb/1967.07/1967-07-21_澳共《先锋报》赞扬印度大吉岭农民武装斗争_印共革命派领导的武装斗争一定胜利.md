The Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist)'s organ, the "Vanguard," published an article on July 20, enthusiastically praising and supporting the armed struggle led by the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, by the farmers of Darjeeling County.

The "Vanguard" stated that the Australian Communist Party (Marxist-Leninist) and all revolutionaries enthusiastically applaud the armed struggle of the people of Darjeeling County. The "Vanguard" pointed out that this struggle has profound significance. It said: "This means that the Indian revolutionary faction has broken through the constraints of legalism, parliamentarism, peaceful transition to socialism, and revisionism. This is the practice of Mao Zedong's great thought that political power grows out of the barrel of a gun."

The "Vanguard" continued: "For many years, Australians have seen in the newspapers reports of the killing and beating of Indian workers and peasants. Every Australian knows the miserable plight of the Indian people. The guns of Anglo-American imperialism and the Indian National Congress are used to maintain this situation." The "Vanguard" emphasized, "Now, the Indian revolutionary faction is using revolutionary force to counter revolutionary force. They will definitely achieve victory."

    澳共《先锋报》赞扬印度大吉岭农民武装斗争
    印共革命派领导的武装斗争一定胜利
    新华社墨尔本二十日电　澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）机关报《先锋报》二十日发表文章，热烈赞扬和支持印度共产党革命派在毛泽东思想指引下领导大吉岭县农民开展革命的武装斗争。
    《先锋报》说，澳大利亚共产党（马克思列宁主义）和一切革命者热烈欢呼印度大吉岭县人民开展的革命武装斗争。《先锋报》指出，这一斗争具有极其深刻的意义。它说：“这意味着，印度革命派冲破了合法主义、议会主义、和平过渡到社会主义以及修正主义的束缚。这是实践了毛泽东关于枪杆子里面出政权的伟大思想。”
    《先锋报》接着说：“多年来，我们澳大利亚人在报纸上看到的是打死和毒打印度工农的消息。每一个澳大利亚人都知道印度人民的悲惨处境。英、美帝国主义和印度国大党的枪杆子是用来维持这些状态的。”《先锋报》强调说，现在，印度的革命派正在用革命的武力来对付反革命的武力。他们一定会取得胜利。
