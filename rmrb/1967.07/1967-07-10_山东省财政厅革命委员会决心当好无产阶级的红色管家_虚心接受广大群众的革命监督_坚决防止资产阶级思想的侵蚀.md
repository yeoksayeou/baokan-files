Editor's Note: "Can those in power humbly accept the revolutionary supervision of the masses? This is a key issue in whether they can hold and use power for the proletariat. It is a major issue concerning whether the revolutionary government will change color." The comrades of the Shandong Provincial Finance Bureau Revolutionary Committee have deeply and correctly understood this point!

Chairman Mao teaches us: "A new social system must be established on the basis of the old one. The remnants of old ideas that reflect the old system will remain in people's minds for a long time and will not easily retreat."

The proletarian revolutionary cadres must hold high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the old ideas, old styles, old traditions, and old habits of the bourgeoisie, and establish the new ideas, new styles, new traditions, and new habits of the proletariat. While transforming the objective world, they must also transform their subjective world. To complete this glorious and arduous task, they must rely on the broad revolutionary masses and rely on supervision from below. The revolutionary supervision of the people armed with Mao Zedong Thought is a reliable guarantee against revisionism. After the proletarian revolutionary cadres take power, if they do not humbly listen to the voices of the masses and fear the criticism and supervision of the masses, then the bourgeois goods left by the handful of power-holders who took the capitalist road within the party will be difficult to eliminate. All the decadent ideas and habits of bureaucratism, such as showing off and flaunting wealth, will easily invade our healthy bodies.

Comrades of the proletarian revolutionary cadres must place themselves under the revolutionary supervision of the broad masses. Only in this way can they better hold and use power for the proletariat and keep their revolutionary spirit forever.

According to a report from our newspaper, since the Shandong Provincial Finance Bureau Revolutionary Committee took power, it has followed Chairman Mao's teaching to "serve the people wholeheartedly and never leave the masses" and humbly accepted the revolutionary supervision of the masses. It has constantly prevented the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, promoted the revolutionization of thought and work, and strictly implemented the state's financial system according to Chairman Mao's great directive to "be thrifty and make revolution."

Recently, the members of the Revolutionary Committee, with the spirit of rectification, repeatedly studied the "Several Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Style" by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the editorial article "Preventing the Infiltration of Bourgeois Ideology" by the Red Flag magazine. They examined the gaps in their thoughts, work styles, and living styles with the ten regulations of the provincial Revolutionary Committee and made regulations to prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideology based on the specific situation of their unit. Everyone deeply felt from learning and practice that whether those in power can humbly accept the revolutionary supervision of the masses is a key issue in whether they can hold and use power for the proletariat. It is a major issue concerning whether the revolutionary government will change color. The Revolutionary Committee must place itself under the supervision of the masses, constantly humbly listen to the opinions of the masses, and continuously transform thoughts and improve work. Only in this way can it become a leadership collective that is highly proletarianized and highly revolutionary.

Learn from Historical Lessons

The members of the Revolutionary Committee analyzed the reasons for the degeneration of a handful of power-holders who took the capitalist road within the original Shandong Provincial Party Committee and clearly saw that some of them were defeated by sugar-coated bullets after liberation. These people did not transform their thoughts, pursued material enjoyment, sought special treatment, and when the masses raised criticisms, they not only did not accept them but even retaliated. Therefore, they gradually fell into the bourgeois quagmire.

They drew this historical lesson: The proletarian revolutionary cadres, from being oppressed to taking power, have changed their status. They must take the overturned chariots of the handful of power-holders who took the capitalist road within the party as a warning, humbly accept the revolutionary supervision of the masses, and resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology. Because all our revolutionary cadres, regardless of their rank, are servants of the people. Everything we do is for the people. If we do not accept the revolutionary supervision of the masses, we will become detached from the masses, go astray, and ultimately be despised by the people.

Seriously Handle Mass Supervision

In the early days of the establishment of the Revolutionary Committee in this bureau, many cadres and masses raised opinions on how the committee members could deeply integrate with the masses and prevent special treatment. Previously, cadres at the level of section chief and above each had their own office, with wicker chairs, leather sofas, and all the necessary equipment. After the Revolutionary Committee took power, should they maintain the status quo or thoroughly change this situation of detachment from the masses? The masses said: The original setup was to show off and flaunt wealth, detaching from the masses. We have taken power, and we want to be revolutionary. We cannot have this setup. At that time, the Revolutionary Committee accepted the opinions of the masses and made a decision: all personal sofas were moved to the conference room; individual offices were merged into several people sharing, regardless of rank, position, or seniority, working together, discussing matters, and solving problems. It was also decided to hand over the small cars to the administrative management department, and in general situations, take public buses or ride bicycles to meetings and commute to work.

The Revolutionary Committee's serious handling of mass supervision was warmly welcomed by cadres and masses. Therefore, the masses paid more attention to the work of the Revolutionary Committee and raised suggestions in a timely manner whenever they encountered problems.

The Revolutionary Committee also studied the suggestions of the masses in a timely manner and quickly made decisions. The bureau had three old loudspeakers, one of which had been used for fifteen or sixteen years. The Revolutionary Committee decided to buy a new set and even planned to send someone to Beijing to print a beautiful red flag. At this time, the People's Daily published the editorial "On Thrift and Revolution (III)," and the masses posted big-character posters, demanding that the Revolutionary Committee follow Chairman Mao's directive to "be thrifty and make revolution" and cancel the original decision. The Revolutionary Committee immediately held a meeting, first studying the editorial of the People's Daily. Everyone realized that a flag and a few loudspeakers, although not much money, were unnecessary expenditures, which was wasteful. We are the Finance Bureau, managing the financial power of a province for the state and the people; if we are extravagant, it will affect the grassroots units and cause great waste to the state. The Revolutionary Committee immediately withdrew the original decision.

Be Good Red Stewards of the Proletariat

The revolutionary supervision of the masses has promoted the continuous revolutionization of the thoughts of the members of the Revolutionary Committee and the continuous resistance to the infiltration of bourgeois ideology. The revolutionization of the thoughts of the members of the Revolutionary Committee, in turn, prevented some grassroots units from developing bad tendencies and effectively ensured the implementation of the state's financial system.

In the past, under the control of a handful of power-holders who took the capitalist road within the party, the Finance Bureau did not emphasize proletarian politics and issued checks arbitrarily, regardless of whether they were really necessary. Now, the revolutionary cadres have taken power and are resolutely acting according to Chairman Mao's teachings, regarding political work as the lifeline of financial work. They regard saving every copper coin as a politically significant matter and resolutely oppose all extravagant and wasteful styles.

During the period of spreading the counter-revolutionary economism, many units wanted to buy cars, broadcasting equipment, cameras, bicycles, etc., and rushed to the Finance Bureau to apply for funds. The Finance Bureau Revolutionary Committee strictly acted according to Chairman Mao's instructions, conducted education on the party's financial policies for these units, exposed the conspiracy of a handful of power-holders who took the capitalist road within the party to spread counter-revolutionary economism, and resisted these unreasonable demands. Recently, many units have made similar requests to the Finance Bureau. Just the request for the purchase of loudspeakers and cameras by some units in the Changwei area alone amounted to nearly four thousand yuan. The Finance Bureau Revolutionary Committee resolutely implemented Chairman Mao's directive to "be thrifty and make revolution" and the state's financial system and did not approve these requests. Their specific actions were: first, not to approve; second, to conduct persuasive and educational work, making everyone understand that "practicing thrift" and opposing extravagance and waste are not small matters but are related to the direction of the revolutionary cadres after taking power and whether the revolutionary government will change color.

Since the Shandong Provincial Finance Bureau Revolutionary Committee took power, it has stopped many units from extravagant and wasteful practices. This not only saved expenses for the state but, more importantly, prevented the spread of economism and resisted the infiltration of bourgeois ideology. The Revolutionary Committee of this bureau also allocated a certain amount of manpower to go deep into the grassroots, propagate and implement the ten regulations of the provincial Revolutionary Committee, and required the grassroots units to thoroughly change their leadership style and do a good job in the revolutionization of the leadership collective.

After the publication of the "Several Regulations on Seriously Changing Work Style" by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee and the editorial article "Preventing the Infiltration of Bourgeois Ideology" by the Red Flag magazine, some responsible comrades of revolutionary mass organizations, revolutionary cadres, and revolutionary youngsters in Shanghai held a symposium, exchanged their learning experiences, and discussed further plans to realize the revolutionization of thought, forever following the course indicated by Chairman Mao.

　　山东省财政厅革命委员会决心当好无产阶级的红色管家
　　虚心接受广大群众的革命监督
　　坚决防止资产阶级思想的侵蚀
    编者按：“当权的同志能不能虚心地接受群众的革命监督，是能否为无产阶级掌好权、用好权的一个关键问题，是关系到革命政权变不变颜色的大问题。”山东省财政厅革命委员会同志们的这个体会，是多么深刻而正确啊！
    毛主席教导我们：“一个崭新的社会制度要从旧制度的基地上建立起来，它就必须清除这个基地。反映旧制度的旧思想的残余，总是长期地留在人们的头脑里，不愿意轻易地退走的。”
    无产阶级革命派一定要高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判旗帜，大破资产阶级的旧思想、旧作风、旧传统、旧习惯，大立无产阶级的新思想、新作风、新传统、新习惯；在改造客观世界的同时，改造自己的主观世界。要完成这项光荣而艰巨的任务，必须依靠广大革命群众，必须依靠自下而上的革命监督。用毛泽东思想武装起来的人民群众的革命监督，是防止修正主义的可靠保证。无产阶级革命派掌权以后，如果不虚心倾听群众的呼声，害怕群众的批评和监督，那么，过去党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派所遗留下来的那一套资产阶级的货色，就很难清除，一切讲排场、闹阔气等腐朽的思想作风和官僚主义旧习气，就很容易侵袭我们健康的肌体。
      无产阶级革命派的同志，一定要将自己置于广大群众的革命监督之下。只有这样，才能更好地为无产阶级掌好权、用好权，才能使自己永葆革命青春。
    本报讯　山东省财政厅革命委员会掌权以来，遵照毛主席“全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众”的教导，虚心接受群众的革命监督，时时处处防止资产阶级思想侵蚀，促进思想革命化和工作革命化，同时根据毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大指示，认真地严格地执行了国家的财政制度。
    最近，革命委员会的成员又以整风的精神，反复学习了《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》和《红旗》杂志评论员文章《防止资产阶级思想侵蚀》，检查了在思想作风、工作作风、生活作风等方面与省革命委员会十条规定的差距，并且根据本单位的情况，作出了防止资产阶级思想侵蚀的规定。大家从学习和实践中深刻地体会到，当权的同志能不能虚心地接受群众的革命监督，是能否为无产阶级掌好权、用好权的一个关键问题，是关系到革命政权变不变颜色的大问题。革命委员会必须把自己置于群众的革命监督之下，经常虚心地听取群众的意见，不断地改造思想，改进工作，才能成为一个非常无产阶级化、非常革命化的领导班子。
    牢牢记取历史的经验教训
    革命委员会成员分析了原山东省委内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派蜕化变质的原因，很清楚地看到其中有些人是在解放以后被糖衣炮弹打倒的。这些人不改造思想，追求物质享受，闹特殊化，而在群众提出批评的时候，不仅不接受，甚至打击报复，所以逐步陷进了资产阶级的泥坑。
    他们从此得出这样一条历史教训：无产阶级革命派从受压制到掌权，地位发生了变化，一定要把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的覆车之辙，引为鉴戒，虚心接受群众的革命监督，抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀。因为我们一切革命干部，不论职务高低，都是人民的勤务员，我们所做的一切，都是为人民服务的。如果不接受群众的革命监督，就会脱离群众，走上邪路，最后必定被人民群众所唾弃。
    认真对待群众的革命监督
    在这个厅的革命委员会成立初期，许多干部和群众就对委员会成员如何深入群众、防止特殊化的问题提出过意见。从前，处长以上的干部，每人一个办公室，藤椅、皮沙发等设备，应有尽有。革命委员会掌权后，是保持原状呢，还是彻底改变这种脱离群众的状况呢？群众说：原来的一套是讲排场，闹阔气，脱离群众。我们掌了权，要搞革命化，不能要这一套。当时，革命委员会就接受了群众的意见，并且作出决定：个人占用的沙发，全部集中到会议室；一个人的办公室，合并成几个人共同使用，不分级别高低、职务大小、资格新老，同在一起工作，商量事情，研究问题。还决定把小轿车交给事务管理局，在一般情况下，都乘公共汽车或骑自行车开会、上下班。
    革命委员会认真对待群众的革命监督的做法，深受干部和群众的欢迎。因此，群众更加关心革委会的工作，不论碰到什么问题，都及时提出建议。
    革委会对群众的建议，也及时研究，并且迅速作出处理。厅里有三个旧扩音器，有一个已经用了十五六年，革委会决定买一套新的，还想派人到北京印一面漂亮的红旗。正在这个时候，《人民日报》发表了《三论节约闹革命》的社论，群众贴大字报，要求革委会遵照毛主席“要节约闹革命”的教导，取消原来的决定。革委会马上召开会议，首先学习了《人民日报》社论。大家认识到，一面旗、几个喇叭，花钱虽然不多，但是不该开支的开支了，这就是浪费。我们是财政厅，为国家、为人民掌管着一个省的财政大权；如果我们首先大手大脚，那就会影响基层单位，给国家造成极大的浪费。革委会立即撤销了原来的决定。
    当好无产阶级的红色管家
    群众的革命监督，促使革命委员会成员的思想不断革命化，不断抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀。革命委员会成员的思想革命化，反过来又防止了一些基层单位发生不良倾向，有力地保证了国家财政制度的贯彻执行。
    过去，在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的控制下，财政厅不突出无产阶级政治，不管是否确实必需，任意滥开支票；现在，革命派掌了权，坚决按照毛主席的教导办事，把政治工作作为财政工作的生命线。他们把节省每一个铜板，都看成是具有政治意义的大事，坚决反对一切铺张浪费的作风。
    在刮反革命经济主义风的时候，许多单位要买汽车、广播器材、照像机、自行车等，纷纷向财政厅提出批款要求。财政厅革委会严格按照毛主席的指示办事，向这些单位进行了党的财政政策的教育，揭露了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派大搞反革命经济主义的阴谋，顶住了这些不合理的要求。最近，又有不少单位向财政厅提出了类似的要求，仅昌潍地区某些单位提出要买广播喇叭、照像机的用费，就将近四千元。财政厅革命委员会坚决执行毛主席“要节约闹革命”的指示和国家的财政制度，没有批准这些要求。他们的具体做法：一是不批准；二是进行说服教育工作，使大家懂得“厉行节约”，反对铺张浪费，绝不是一件小事，而是关系到革命派当权后向何处去的问题，关系到革命政权变不变色的问题。
    山东省财政厅革命委员会掌权以来，制止了许多单位的铺张浪费现象。这不仅为国家节约了开支，更重要的是防止了经济主义的泛滥，抵制了资产阶级思想的侵蚀。这个厅的革命委员会，还抽出一定力量深入基层，宣传、贯彻省革命委员会的十条规定，要求基层单位彻底转变领导作风，搞好领导班子的革命化。（附图片）
    《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》和《红旗》杂志第十期评论员文章《防止资产阶级思想侵蚀》发表以后，上海的一些革命群众组织负责人、革命干部和革命小将，举行座谈，交流了学习体会，畅谈进一步实现思想革命化的打算，永远沿着毛主席指引的航道前进。
