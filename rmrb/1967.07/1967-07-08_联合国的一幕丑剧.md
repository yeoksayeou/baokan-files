The United Nations General Assembly held an emergency session on July 4th, which resulted in no concrete action, but merely a farce.

This session did not touch the mastermind behind the armed invasion of Arab countries, the American imperialists, not even a single hair. It also did not touch the American imperialists' lackey, Israel, which still occupies a large portion of Arab territories. On the contrary, the arrogance of the American imperialists and their lackey, Israel, has become even more brazen. The head of Israel, Dayan, shouted outside the session that they would annex the Gaza Strip and the West Bank, which they have occupied, into Israel's territory. The so-called emergency session of the General Assembly is nothing but a clumsy trick to deceive the Arab countries and world public opinion.

After betraying the Arab countries, the Soviet revisionists suddenly proposed to convene an emergency session of the General Assembly. What is the real intention behind this? Originally, the head of the Soviet revisionists, Kosygin, went to the United States to pay homage to the head of American imperialism, Johnson. However, under the watchful eyes of the world, he felt a bit embarrassed. Thus, he came up with a trick, bringing a large entourage to attend the emergency session of the General Assembly. Some lackeys of the Soviet revisionists also rushed to play their parts. In reality, this is just a formality. The real show is being staged in Glassboro. Once these two scoundrels complete their dirty global deal, the farce at the United Nations will also come to an end.

What is the United Nations? It is originally a tool for the big bully, American imperialism, and the second bully, the Soviet revisionists, to promote neo-colonialism and big-power politics. Although the Arab countries, Albania, and many Asian and African countries have strongly condemned the aggression of American imperialism and its lackeys, the United States and the Soviet Union can still manipulate the situation, and the aggressors can still find refuge, while the victims can only suffer. Such a United Nations can only be a haven for imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries, and a chain for oppressed nations.

After the vote at the emergency session of the General Assembly, American imperialism is playing new tricks. The Johnson administration openly stated on July 5th: "The United States believes that the Security Council is the best place to handle this (Middle East) issue." The ball is kicked back and forth, from the Security Council to the United Nations General Assembly, and then back to the Security Council. In reality, it is all the same, with the United States and the Soviet Union dominating the fate of the Arab countries.

Our great leader, Chairman Mao, teaches us: "The oppressed peoples and nations must not pin their hopes on the 'wisdom' of imperialism and its lackeys, but can only achieve victory through strengthening unity and persevering in struggle."

The Arab people want to defend their independence and defeat the aggression of American imperialism and its lackeys. They must rely on their own struggle. If they place their hopes on the Soviet revisionists and the United Nations, it would be like consorting with tigers, and they would suffer great losses and be deceived. They must never forget the bloody lessons of the Middle East events!

　　联合国的一幕丑剧
　　本报评论员
    联合国大会紧急会议在四日进行了表决，一事无成，只是闹了一幕丑剧。
    这个会议对策划武装侵略阿拉伯国家的元凶美帝国主义，一根毫毛也没有碰；对至今还侵占着阿拉伯国家大片领土的美帝国主义的走狗以色列，也一根毫毛没有碰。相反的，美帝国主义及其走狗以色列的气焰却更加嚣张了。以色列的头子达扬在会外大叫要把他们侵占的加沙地带和约旦河西岸并入以色列的版图。所谓联大紧急会议，完全是愚弄阿拉伯国家和世界舆论的一个拙劣的把戏。
    苏修集团在出卖阿拉伯国家之后，突然提出召开联大紧急会议，这究竟是怎么回事？原来，苏修头目柯西金到美国去的真正意图，是要去朝拜美帝国主义头子约翰逊。可是，在众目睽睽之下，他感到有点不便。于是，他就想出了一个花招，带了一大帮人马，去出席联大紧急会议，苏修的一些娄罗也赶去跑龙套。其实，这不过是走走过场。真正的戏是在葛拉斯堡罗演出。这两个家伙的全球性的肮脏买卖一做完，联合国的这出假戏也就该收场了。
    联合国是个什么东西？它本来就是大霸主美帝国主义和二霸主苏修集团两家推行新殖民主义和大国强权政治的工具。尽管阿拉伯国家、阿尔巴尼亚和许多亚非国家，对美帝国主义及其走狗的侵略，表示了强烈的愤慨。可是，美苏两家照样可以进行操纵，侵略者照样得到庇护，被侵略者只能受气。这样一个联合国只能是帝、修、反的逋逃薮，被压迫民族的锁链。
    美帝国主义在联大紧急会议表决之后，又在玩弄新的阴谋了。约翰逊政府在五日就公开表示：“美国认为，安理会是处理这一（中东）问题的最好场所”。皮球踢来踢去，从安理会踢到联合国大会，再由联合国大会踢回安理会，其实都是一个样，就是要由美苏两家来主宰阿拉伯国家的命运。
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席教导我们：“被压迫人民和被压迫民族，决不能把自己的解放寄托在帝国主义及其走狗的‘明智’上面，而只有通过加强团结、坚持斗争，才能取得胜利。”
    阿拉伯人民要维护自己的独立，要打败美帝国主义及其走狗的侵略，一定要靠自己的斗争。如果把希望寄托在苏修集团和联合国的身上，那就等于是与虎谋皮，就要吃大亏，上大当。切切不可忘记中东事件的血的教训！
