To meet the needs of restoring capitalism, the Soviet revisionist leaders, under the pretext of "cultural ties" and "cultural exchange," have thrown open their doors to the West and are increasingly eager to peddle the reactionary and decadent culture and lifestyle of the West. The United States, on the other hand, has long used "cultural cooperation" as an important means to infiltrate the Soviet Union and promote its peaceful evolution.

Regarding this point, let us examine the comments of the mouthpiece of American imperialism:

The *New York Times Magazine* of the United States once published an article on the so-called "cultural exchange" between the Soviet Union and the United States. It praised the Soviet revisionists for actively signing one "cultural exchange" agreement after another with the United States on schedule. The article stated that the various activities carried out under the "cultural exchange" projects between the two countries are the most stable aspect of Sino-American relations. The fundamental goal of the United States from the very beginning has been to create holes in the Iron Curtain—to make the Soviet Union open to influences from the West. Another goal is to obtain more firsthand observational materials about the situation behind the curtain. American officials in charge of this plan believe that both of these goals have made significant progress through the exchanges.

### 苏美“文化交流”的“成果”

　　苏美“文化交流”的“成果”
    为了复辟资本主义的需要，苏修领导在“文化联系”、“文化交流”的幌子下，向西方敞开大门，越来越起劲地贩卖西方反动腐朽的文化和生活方式。而美国也早就把“文化合作”作为向苏联实行渗透、促进苏联和平演变的重要手段。
    关于这点，请看美帝国主义喉舌的评论：
    美国《纽约时报杂志》曾经就苏美所谓“文化交流”发表文章。它称赞苏修积极地按期同美国签订一个接一个的“文化交流”协定。文章说，两国在“文化交流”项目下开展的种种活动，是苏美关系中最稳定的方面。美国的根本目标，从一开始就是在铁幕上打洞——使苏联向来自西方的影响开放。另一个目标是获取关于屏障后面的情况的更多的第一手观察材料。负责此项计划的美国官员认为，这两个目标，通过交流都获得了显著进展。
