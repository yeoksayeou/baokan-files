During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, our Shanghai Engineering Machinery Factory had two factions: the revolutionary faction led by the "Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps" and the conservative faction led by the "Workers' Red Guards." During the struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, there were significant disagreements between the two factions, often leading to heated debates. After the January Revolution, the "Workers' Revolutionary Rebel Corps" took power. The question of how to correctly handle the masses who had been deceived within the conservative organization and how to unite the broad masses to direct the spearhead against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party became an urgent issue to be resolved.

At that time, I was also unclear on how to solve this problem. I once thought that since they had previously relied on their numbers to suppress us, now that we had taken power, we could suppress them. Therefore, no matter what meeting was held, as soon as they spoke, we would say, "'Old conservatives' are trying to reverse their verdict and grab straws." We even dragged a responsible person from the "Red Guards" to a public meeting for criticism. As a result, many masses who had participated in the conservative organization developed a strong sense of opposition towards the revolutionary faction.

Later, through studying Chairman Mao's brilliant work "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," I came to realize that the contradiction between the proletarian revolutionary faction and the masses who had joined the conservative organization is a contradiction among the people. The vast majority of the deceived masses are revolutionary at heart. They were temporarily deceived by the capitalist reactionary line; it is a matter of consciousness. Chairman Mao teaches us: "Before us are two types of social contradictions: those between ourselves and the enemy and those among the people. These are contradictions of a completely different nature." He further states: "Different types of contradictions can only be resolved by different methods." Based on Chairman Mao's teachings, we frequently had heart-to-heart talks with members of the "Red Guards," studied relevant documents with them, guided them to draw a clear line with the capitalist reactionary line, and encouraged them to rebel. At this time, some revolutionary comrades said: "Remember how they suppressed us so harshly? Now that we have taken power, if we don't exert some pressure on them, but instead humble ourselves to do work for them, it seems like we are afraid of them." Faced with these reflections, what should we do? We again reviewed Chairman Mao's words: "All problems of a ideological nature, all problems of controversy among the people, can only be resolved by democratic methods, only by the methods of discussion, criticism, and persuasion and education, and cannot be resolved by coercive or overbearing methods." We realized that our previous approach of coercion was not in line with Chairman Mao's teachings. This approach was not conducive to uniting more than ninety-five percent of the revolutionary masses. Therefore, we insisted on doing thorough and detailed ideological work with the deceived masses, conducting heart-to-heart talks, raising their class consciousness, and helping them to consciously rebel. At the same time, we also explained the importance of ideological work to the members of the revolutionary rebel corps and mobilized everyone to do ideological work for the deceived masses. Even the leaders of the conservative organization, we patiently did their ideological work. For example, we often had heart-to-heart talks with the main responsible person of the "Red Guards" in our factory, helping him analyze the nature and root of his mistakes. Sometimes, he was so moved that he shed tears. After he recognized his mistakes, he wrote a big-character poster, exposing his process of being deceived, and calling on the deceived "Red Guards" members to listen to Chairman Mao's words and quickly rebel.

Through our repeated help and patient persuasion, members of the "Red Guards" began to rebel one after another, exposing the crimes of the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within our factory. Many people requested to join the revolutionary rebel organization. In this way, the ranks of the revolutionary rebel faction quickly expanded and developed, and the Cultural Revolution in our factory presented a great situation.

    谈心好
    上海工程机械厂工人  龚龙福
    在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们上海工程机械厂存在两派：以“工人革命造反队”为一方的革命派和以“工人赤卫队”为另一方的保守派。在向党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派斗争的时候，两派之间分歧很大。经常争论不休。“一月革命”后，“工人革命造反队”掌了权。如何正确对待保守组织中受蒙蔽的群众，团结广大群众，把矛头指向党内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派，成为急待解决的问题。
    当时，我对如何解决这个问题，思想上也不明确。我曾经认为，过去他们依仗人多，压得我们挺厉害，这下子我们可以压压他们了。所以，不管开什么会，只要他们一讲话，我们就说：“‘老保’想翻案，想捞稻草了。”还把“赤卫队”的一个负责人揪去开大会批判。这样做的结果，使参加过保守组织的许多群众对造反派产生严重的对立情绪。
    后来，通过学习毛主席《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》这篇光辉著作，使自己认识到：无产阶级革命派和参加保守组织的群众之间的矛盾是人民内部矛盾。受蒙蔽的群众中绝大多数是要革命的。他们是一时受了资产阶级反动路线的蒙蔽，是认识问题。毛主席教导我们：“在我们的面前有两类社会矛盾，这就是敌我之间的矛盾和人民内部的矛盾。这是性质完全不同的两类矛盾。”又说：“不同质的矛盾，只有用不同质的方法才能解决。”根据毛主席的教导：我们经常找赤卫队员谈心，和他们一起学习有关文件，引导他们与资产阶级反动路线划清界限，鼓励他们起来造反。这时，个别造反派战士就讲：“想当初他们压得我们多么厉害，今天，我们掌了权，不对他们施加点压力，反而低三下四地向他们做工作，好象怕他们似的。”在这些反映面前，究竟应该怎样办？我们又重温了毛主席的一段话：“凡属于思想性质的问题，凡属于人民内部的争论问题，只能用民主的方法去解决，只能用讨论的方法、批评的方法、说服教育的方法去解决，而不能用强制的、压服的方法去解决。”我们认识到：过去对他们用压服的办法是不符合毛主席的教导的。这样做，不利于团结百分之九十五以上的革命群众。于是，我们坚持对受蒙蔽的群众要做深入细致的思想工作，开展谈心活动，提高他们的阶级觉悟，帮助他们自觉地起来造反。同时，我们也向革命造反队队员讲清楚思想工作的重要性，动员大家都来做受蒙蔽群众的思想工作。就是保守组织的负责人，我们也耐心地做他们的思想工作。例如：我们经常找我厂的赤卫队主要负责人谈心，帮助他分析错误的性质和根源，有时，使他感动得流下了眼泪。他认识了错误后，就写出大字报，揭露了自己受蒙蔽的经过，呼吁受蒙蔽的赤卫队员要听毛主席的话，赶快起来造反。
    经过我们反复帮助、耐心说服，赤卫队员纷纷起来造反，揭发了我厂党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的罪恶。许多人要求参加造反派组织。这样，革命造反派的队伍迅速扩大和发展了，我厂的文化大革命呈现一片大好形势。
