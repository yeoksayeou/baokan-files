Hong Kong Chinese seamen's strike action has hit the vital spot, choking the British and causing the enemy to panic and lose their footing. The Hong Kong British authorities attempted to threaten and bribe the seamen to resume work, but were met with stern resistance from the Chinese seamen.

According to a report from Xinhua News Agency in Hong Kong on the 22nd, the strike action by Hong Kong Chinese seamen refusing to transport goods in and out of Hong Kong has struck at the heart of the British authorities, causing the enemy to panic and lose their composure.

Hong Kong Chinese seamen began refusing to transport goods in and out of Hong Kong on the 17th and announced that any ships coming to and from Hong Kong that violate this would be subject to a strike. By the 22nd, ten foreign ships had been affected by the strike action of Hong Kong Chinese seamen. On the 21st, the "Chichangliang" ship of the Dutch Zwaan China Mail Line, which arrived in Hong Kong from Japan, ignored the warnings of Hong Kong Chinese seamen and loaded and unloaded goods in Hong Kong, causing all Hong Kong Chinese seamen on board to be indignant and immediately go on strike. They also posted the "Open Letter to Chinese Seamen" issued by the Hong Kong Seamen's Union Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee on the 17th. Two ships of this company that arrived on the 17th had loaded and unloaded more than 3,500 tons of goods in Hong Kong and were struck by Hong Kong Chinese seamen, remaining paralyzed in the harbor to this day. The "Da Baoshi," "Da Zhongshan," and "Da Baolai" ships of the Shunchang Shipping Company, as well as the "Xialimu" cargo ship of the Norwegian Dolphin Shipping Company, were all affected by the strike action of Hong Kong seamen and have not been able to set sail since then.

The strike action by Hong Kong Chinese seamen has caused the British authorities and shipping companies with maritime relations with Hong Kong to be greatly alarmed. They resorted to threats and bribes in an attempt to persuade the seamen to resume work. After the Hong Kong Chinese seamen on the "Qilianfulu" ship, owned by the British Jardine Matheson, and the "Xingtulianjia" ship, owned by the British Lancashire & Yorkshire Shipping Company, took strike action, the company panicked and attempted to use dismissal as a means to force the seamen to resume work. However, the Chinese seamen, with high morale, firmly stated: As long as the British authorities do not back down, we will not work on the affected ships.

The entire crew of fifty-plus Chinese seamen on the "Xialimu" cargo ship arrived in Hong Kong late on the 17th and immediately left the ship to join the strike. The British authorities and the shipping company, in a fit of rage, tried to bribe the seamen to resume work by offering each seaman an additional eight pounds in salary. They also secretly moved the ship to the outer harbor in an attempt to sneak the seamen on board under the cover of darkness. However, the seamen exposed the plot of the British authorities and the shipping company and unanimously refused to sign the contract, declaring with righteous indignation: Chinese seamen have dignity. No matter how much money you offer, we will not board the ship!

The spokesperson for the Hong Kong Seamen's Union Anti-British Persecution Struggle Committee issued a written statement on the 21st, pointing out that the strike action taken by Hong Kong Chinese seamen, who have a glorious anti-imperialist and patriotic tradition, is dealing a heavy blow to the British fascist authorities. The spokesperson said: After the Seamen's Union Struggle Committee issued the call to action on July 17, it immediately received a warm response from all seamen in Hong Kong. Many seamen, while sailing at sea, heard the call from the radio and immediately packed their belongings, preparing to leave the ship upon arrival; some seamen specially called the union to express their support. In just a few days, more than a thousand seamen who stayed in Hong Kong reported to the union and registered to participate in the strike action.

The spokesperson said: The British authorities are terrified of the seamen's strike action and are constantly operating their propaganda machines day and night, deceiving Hong Kong compatriots by saying things like "the strike has failed" and "ships are entering and leaving as normal," but all this is in vain. The fact is that after the seamen went on strike, the British authorities were in a state of panic, trying to find people to work everywhere, and using despicable means such as dismissal and police threats to force seamen to board ships. An elderly cook in his fifties with poor eyesight was said to be promoted to helmsman; a young new sailor was said to be able to do the jobs of sailor, helmsman, and sailor all at once. The "Qilianfulu" ship, in a state of panic due to a shortage of seamen, ignored maritime safety and fled the harbor in a state of disarray. Currently, the seamen's strike action has just begun and has already caused a great stir. Many shipping companies have ordered their ships not to come to Hong Kong.

The spokesperson said: The heroic Hong Kong Chinese seamen follow Chairman Mao's words, dare to struggle, and dare to win. They have traveled the five continents and four seas and have rich experience in struggle. They have seen through the weakness of British imperialism. They dare to struggle in American ports, dare to struggle in British ports, and even dare to struggle in South Vietnam under American rule. The declining British imperialism is not even in the eyes of the heroic Hong Kong Chinese seamen.

The spokesperson said: The action by Hong Kong seamen to sanction the British has been supported by revolutionary workers from the China Seamen's Union and other units. This support is excellent and gives great encouragement to all seamen in Hong Kong. We Hong Kong seamen will not disappoint the expectations of our compatriots in the motherland. We will firmly sanction the British to the end, vowing to choke the British's import and export throat to death until we achieve the final victory.

    香港我海员的制裁行动一下击中要害
    捏紧港英咽喉　敌人阵脚大乱
    港英当局妄图威胁利诱海员开工，遭到我海员严厉反击
    据新华社香港二十二日电　香港中国海员拒绝运输货物进出香港的制裁行动，击中了港英当局的要害，使得敌人惊慌失措，阵脚大乱。
    香港中国海员从十七日开始拒绝运输货物进出香港，并宣布来往香港的轮船，如有违犯，则予以罢工制裁。到二十二日为止，受到香港中国海员罢工制裁的远洋轮船已有十艘。二十一日从日本抵港的荷兰渣华邮船公司“芝渣连加”号轮船，不顾香港中国海员的警告，在香港装卸货物，引起船上全体香港中国海员的激愤，马上罢工制裁，并在船上贴起香港海员工会反对港英迫害斗争委员会十七日发表的《告中国海员书》。这家公司十七日抵港的两艘轮船，由于在香港装卸了三千五百多吨货物，遭到香港中国海员的罢工制裁，至今仍瘫痪在海港。顺昌船务公司的“大宝石”号、“大中山”号和“大宝来”号，以及挪威多利顺船务公司“夏利睦”号货轮，在受到香港海员罢工制裁后，迄今无法开航。
    香港中国海员的制裁行动使港英当局以及同香港有航运关系的船务公司大感惊慌。他们实行威迫利诱，妄图拉拢海员开工。属于英资渣甸洋行的“奇连福禄”号和属于英资兰烟囱船务公司的“兴图连加士”号的香港中国海员采取罢工行动后，公司方面慌了手脚，妄图用开除来胁迫海员开工，但是，斗志昂扬的中国海员坚决表示：港英当局一天不低头，我们就一天不到受制裁的船上工作。
    “夏利睦”号货轮的全体中国海员五十多人，十七日晚抵港后，马上离船，参加罢工行列。港英当局和船公司气急败坏地四出活动，他们答应给每个海员加薪八英镑，妄图诱骗海员开工，并且偷偷把船开到港口外，企图摸黑把海员偷运登船。但是，海员们坚决揭露了港英当局和船公司的阴谋，他们一致拒绝签订合约，并且大义凛然地说：中国海员是有骨气的，不管你给多少钱，我们坚决不登船！
    香港海员工会反对港英迫害斗争委员会发言人二十一日发表书面谈话指出，具有反帝爱国光荣传统的香港中国海员所采取的罢工制裁行动，正在给港英法西斯当局以沉重的打击。发言人说：七月十七日海员工会斗委会发出战斗号召后，立即受到全港海员的热烈响应。许多海员在海上航行中，从电台听到工会的号召后，马上收拾行李，准备到港后离船；有些海员特地来电给工会，表示响应号召。仅仅数天内，已有一千多名留港海员到工会报到登记，参加罢工制裁行动。
    发言人说：港英当局对海员的罢工制裁行动怕得要死，日夜不停地开动他们的宣传机器，欺骗香港同胞，说什么“罢工失败”、“轮船进出正常”，但这一切都是徒劳的。事实是，海员实行罢工制裁后，港英当局狼狈万分，到处拉人开工，并用开除、警察恐吓等无耻手段，妄图迫使海员登船。一个五十多岁老眼昏花的厨工，港英当局竟说可以提升为舵工；一个年青的新水手，竟说可以做水手长、舵工、水手等工作，一身兼三职。“奇连福禄”号就是在海员不足的情况下，不顾航行安全，狼狈逃出港海的。目前，海员的罢工制裁行动只是刚刚开始，就已经引起极大震动，许多船公司已着令轮船不要驶来香港。
    发言人说：英雄的香港中国海员听毛主席的话，敢于斗争，敢于胜利，他们是好样的。他们走遍五洲四海，有着丰富的斗争经验。他们看透了英帝国主义的虚弱本质。他们敢于在美国港口斗，敢于在英国港口斗，甚至敢于在美帝统治下的南越斗，已经日薄西山的小小港英帝国主义更不放在英雄的香港中国海员眼里。
    发言人说：香港海员制裁港英的行动，得到中国海员工会等单位革命职工来电支持。这些支持一千个好，一万个好，给全港海员极大的鼓舞。我们香港海员决不辜负祖国亲人的期望，坚决制裁港英到底，誓死捏死港英进出口的咽喉，直到取得最后胜利。
