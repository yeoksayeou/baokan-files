Friends from Five Continents Demonstrate at the Burmese Embassy in China
Strongly Condemn the Brutal Atrocities of the Ne Win Reactionary Government Against Overseas Chinese in Burma and Chinese Personnel in Burma
Firmly Support the Armed Struggle of the Burmese Revolutionary People Under the Leadership of the Burmese Communist Party

New China News Agency, July 3rd: "Down with U.S. imperialism!" "Down with Soviet modern revisionism!" "Down with the Ne Win reactionary government in Burma!" "All reactionaries are paper tigers!" Friends from 40 countries across five continents working in Beijing gathered today to march and demonstrate in front of the Burmese Embassy in China, expressing their indignation and strong condemnation of the fascist atrocities committed by the Ne Win reactionary government in Burma against overseas Chinese in Burma and Chinese personnel in Burma. The passionate slogans echoed through the streets where the Burmese Embassy is located.

At half past three in the afternoon, more than 90 foreign friends, enraged by the fascist atrocities of the Burmese reactionary government, carried banners with the image of the great leader of the world's revolutionary people, Chairman Mao, and slogans written in Arabic, Japanese, English, French, and other languages, as well as cartoons condemning the Burmese reactionaries. They chanted slogans and marched proudly and vigorously to the front of the Burmese Embassy in China. The foreign friends gathered in front of the Burmese Embassy, where protest letters and banners were posted, repeatedly raising their arms and shouting slogans in various languages to condemn the Ne Win reactionary government in Burma for following the lead of U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism in their frenzied anti-China and anti-Chinese actions. The foreign friends, filled with internationalist spirit, waved red copies of "Quotations from Chairman Mao" and sang "The Internationale" loudly, repeatedly shouting, "Long live the invincible Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live Chairman Mao!" "Long live the Burmese people!" They expressed firm support for the overseas Chinese in Burma and Chinese personnel in Burma, and also expressed firm support for the armed struggle of the Burmese revolutionary people under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party.

Sudanese friend Keer represented the foreign friends working in Beijing in reading a protest letter to the Burmese Embassy in China.

The protest letter severely denounced the fascist atrocities of the Ne Win reactionary government in Burma. The protest letter said, "Ne Win reactionary government, you paper tiger, following the common enemy of all the people of the world, U.S. imperialism, and Soviet modern revisionism, you will gain nothing but the limitless hatred of the peasants, workers, revolutionary intellectuals, and all patriotic and revolutionary people in Burma. Today, you have already completely fallen into the encirclement of the Burmese people. The Burmese people, under the leadership of their National United Front and the Burmese Communist Party, are waging armed struggle and will smash your rotten regime to pieces, returning Burma to the hands of the Burmese people. Your days are numbered, and no matter what measures you take, you cannot save yourselves. You are doomed to fail."

The protest letter exposed the numerous crimes of the Ne Win reactionary government. The protest letter said, "You miserable American lackey, since 1962, when you massacred more than a hundred students with machine guns, your filthy hands have been stained with the blood of Burma's finest sons and daughters. Now your claws are stained with the blood of the overseas Chinese who have shared joys and sorrows with the Burmese people for many years. Not only that, you have also brutally murdered Chinese diplomatic personnel and Chinese experts who came to help the Burmese people and strengthen friendship with the Burmese people. You have also injured many people and insulted the national emblem of China and the people of China, as well as the great leader of all revolutionary people in the world, Chairman Mao Zedong. The protest letter asked the Burmese reactionary government: What have you gained from this incident? Did you get a few hundred million dollars from the U.S. imperialists and Soviet modern revisionists? The protest letter pointed out: The Burmese reactionary government is digging its own grave.

The protest letter said, Chairman Mao taught us that all those who collude with imperialism are our enemies. Ne Win reactionary government, you are firmly following the lead of U.S. imperialism, you are the enemy of the Burmese people, the Chinese people, and all revolutionary people in the world. You are lifting a stone to drop it on your own feet, you are digging your own grave with your own hands.

The protest letter said, we fully support the protest statement of the Chinese government on the 29th. We call on all revolutionary and progressive forces in the world to support this statement and strongly condemn your fascist atrocities.

The protest letter concluded: "Down with the Ne Win reactionary government!" "Down with Ne Win!" "Long live the struggle of the Burmese people under the leadership of the National United Front and the Burmese Communist Party!" "Long live proletarian internationalism!" "Long live the great people of China!" "Long live the great leader of all revolutionary people in the world, Chairman Mao!"

Palestinian friends in Beijing also submitted a protest letter to the Burmese Embassy in China. This protest letter solemnly pointed out that the Burmese reactionary government is a criminal and executioner, a lackey of U.S. imperialism and an ally of the Soviet revisionist group. The protest letter said, the Burmese reactionary government must stop its aggression against the great people of China, stop its criminal acts against the overseas Chinese in Burma, stop its criminal acts against the Burmese people, and stop its criminal acts against the freedom fighters of Burma. The protest letter said: The freedom fighters of Burma are waging armed struggle against your fascist regime—the puppet of U.S. imperialism. The brave Burmese people will surely smash your paper tiger.

    新华社三日讯　“打倒美帝国主义！”“打倒苏联现代修正主义！”“打倒缅甸奈温反动政府！”“一切反动派都是纸老虎！”在北京工作的来自五大洲四十个国家的外国朋友，今天结队来到缅甸驻中国大使馆门前举行游行示威，愤怒抗议和强烈谴责缅甸奈温反动政府对旅缅华侨和中国驻缅人员的法西斯血腥暴行。激愤的口号声响彻缅甸大使馆所在的街区。
    下午三时半，被缅甸反动政府法西斯暴行激怒了的九十多位外国朋友，高举着世界革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席的像和用阿拉伯文、日文、英文、法文等书写的标语牌和谴责缅甸反动派的漫画，高呼口号，雄赳赳、气昂昂地来到缅甸驻中国大使馆门前。外国朋友聚集在贴满了抗议书和抗议标语的缅甸大使馆的大门前，一遍又一遍地用各种语言振臂高呼口号，愤怒谴责缅甸奈温反动政府追随美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义疯狂反华排华的罪行。外国朋友满怀国际主义豪情，挥动着红彤彤的《毛主席语录》，放声高唱《国际歌》，并且不断高呼：“战无不胜的毛泽东思想万岁！”“毛主席万岁！”“缅甸人民万岁！”对旅居缅甸的华侨和中国驻缅人员表示坚决的支持，同时对缅甸革命人民在缅甸共产党领导下进行的武装斗争表示坚决的支持。
    苏丹朋友凯尔代表在京工作的外国朋友宣读了给缅甸驻中国大使馆的抗议信。
    抗议信痛斥了缅甸奈温反动政府的法西斯暴行。抗议信说，缅甸反动政府，你们这只纸老虎，追随全世界人民的共同敌人美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义，你们除了遭到缅甸的农民、工人、革命知识分子以及一切爱国志士和革命人民的无限痛恨以外，将一无所得。今天，你们已经完全陷入缅甸人民的重重包围之中，缅甸人民在他们的民族民主团结阵线和缅甸共产党领导下，正在进行武装斗争，他们必将把你们的腐朽政权砸个稀烂，使缅甸重新回到缅甸人民手里，你们的日子不会长了，你们不论采取什么措施都挽救不了你们的狗命，你们注定要失败。
    抗议信揭露了奈温反动政府的累累罪行。抗议信说，你们这只可悲的美国走狗，自从一九六二年你们用机关枪屠杀一百多名学生以来，你们肮脏的双手沾满了缅甸优秀儿女的鲜血。现在你们的魔掌又沾满了许多年来同缅甸人民同甘共苦的华侨的鲜血。不仅如此，你们还野蛮地杀害了前来帮助缅甸人民和加强同缅甸人民友谊的中国外交人员和中国专家。你们还打伤了许多人，并侮辱了中国国徽和中国人民以及世界一切革命人民的伟大领袖毛泽东主席。抗议信质问缅甸反动政府：你们从这一事件中捞到了什么？是不是从美帝国主义者和苏联现代修正主义者那里得到几百万美元？抗议信指出：缅甸反动政府正在自掘坟墓。
    抗议信说，毛主席教导我们，一切同帝国主义相勾结的人都是我们的敌人。缅甸反动政府，你们死心塌地跟着美帝国主义跑，你们是缅甸人民、中国人民和全世界一切革命人民的敌人。你们搬起石头打自己的脚，你们正在用自己的手在给自己挖掘坟墓。
    抗议信说，我们完全支持中国政府二十九日的抗议声明，我们呼吁世界一切革命的和进步的力量支持这一声明，并强烈谴责你们的法西斯暴行。
    抗议信最后说：“打倒奈温反动政府！”“打倒奈温！”“缅甸人民的民族民主团结阵线和缅甸共产党领导的缅甸人民的斗争万岁！”“无产阶级国际主义万岁！”“伟大的中国人民万岁！”“全世界一切革命人民的伟大领袖毛主席万岁！”
    在北京的巴勒斯坦朋友也向缅甸驻中国大使馆递交了抗议信。这封抗议信严正指出，缅甸反动政府是罪犯和刽子手，是美帝国主义的走狗和苏修集团的同盟者。抗议信说，缅甸反动政府必须停止对伟大的中国人民的侵犯，停止对旅居缅甸的华侨的犯罪行为，停止对缅甸人民的犯罪行为，停止对缅甸自由战士的犯罪行为。抗议信说：缅甸的自由战士正在进行武装斗争，反对你们的法西斯政权——美帝国主义的傀儡，英勇的缅甸人民一定要粉碎你们这只纸老虎。
