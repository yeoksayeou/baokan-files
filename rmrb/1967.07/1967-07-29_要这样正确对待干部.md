A certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, while supporting our team, discovered that there was an erroneous idea among the masses that "all those in power should step aside." They organized the poor and lower-middle peasants to study Chairman Mao's teaching on "Who are our enemies? Who are our friends? This is a question of primary importance in revolution." We came to realize that cadres must be analyzed according to class, and those who have made mistakes but are determined to correct them should be dealt with by "looking into and helping."

Next, the comrades from the unit further analyzed the cadres in our team with us: for example, the deputy team leader of the production brigade, Wu Fasheng, had made some mistakes and his work methods were flawed. However, he was willing to follow the Party and determined to correct his mistakes. We should help him with class feelings. To teach us how to do political and ideological work, the comrades from the unit personally had a heart-to-heart talk with Wu Fasheng, guiding him to recall the bitter life of wandering and begging for food before liberation, and studying Chairman Mao's works together. Wu Fasheng finally recognized his mistakes and actively made amends. He not only took the lead in production but also bravely exposed the class enemies who had infiltrated the cadre ranks.

We poor and lower-middle peasants learned from the comrades of the People's Liberation Army, seriously did political and ideological work, united the masses and cadres, and worked together to seize the revolution and promote production.

    要这样正确对待干部
    解放军某部在支援我队时，发现群众中存在着“凡是当权派都得靠边站”的错误思想，就组织贫下中农学习毛主席“谁是我们的敌人？谁是我们的朋友？这个问题是革命的首要问题”的教导。我们认识到，对干部要进行阶级分析，对犯了错误但有决心改正的干部，要“一看二帮”。
    接着，部队的同志又进一步和我们一起对队里干部进行了具体分析：比如生产队副队长吴发胜，犯过一些错误，工作方法也有毛病；但是，他愿意跟着党走，决心改正错误。我们就要满怀阶级感情帮助他。为了教给我们如何做政治思想工作，部队同志亲自和吴发胜谈心，启发他回忆解放前到处流浪讨饭的痛苦生活，和他一起学习毛主席著作，吴发胜终于认识了自己的错误，并且积极将功补过。他不仅在生产中走在前，而且勇敢地揭发了钻进干部队伍来的阶级敌人。
    我们贫下中农学习解放军同志的榜样，认真做思想政治工作，团结了群众和干部，同心协力狠抓革命，猛促生产。
