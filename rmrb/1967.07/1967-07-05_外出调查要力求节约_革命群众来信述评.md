Various Red Guards and revolutionary masses across the country have, in order to thoroughly overthrow, smash, and expose the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party, conducted arduous and meticulous investigative work outside their units. This is necessary.

However, judging from the current situation in some units, the principle of "frugality in revolution" as advocated by Chairman Mao has not been strictly followed in external investigations. Some units lack unified leadership, with various revolutionary organizations acting independently, each sending people away from their production posts to conduct investigations. A reader from Shenyang wrote that in one unit, there are three mass organizations. To investigate the same material, each organization sent out two people, and even those who did not join any revolutionary organization sent two representatives. Just the travel expenses amounted to over a thousand yuan. A reader from Tianjin reported that some revolutionary organizations have set up several investigation teams, but they do not coordinate their efforts. Although they are going to the same place to investigate, several teams could have arranged it together to save manpower and resources, but they insist on going separately. As a result, personnel from the same unit end up visiting the same person at the same time. A reader from Beijing wrote that in their office, one comrade had to receive multiple groups from the same unit to discuss the same issue.

Some readers also pointed out that in some units, the investigation work is not treated seriously. Before the investigation, adequate preparations are not made, resulting in wasted trips and the squandering of manpower and resources.

The situations reflected by the readers are serious instances of waste. They not only consume a large amount of state funds but also increase the number of non-production personnel. They affect the revolution and production in both the home unit and other units and add to the burden on transportation and other aspects.

Therefore, all units and revolutionary organizations must remember Chairman Mao's teaching to "strive for economy and do more with less money." External investigations must be guided by political principles, opposing the practices of sectarianism and dispersal. They must cooperate with each other and foster a sense of the overall situation. Depending on the specific circumstances, either establish a unified special investigation team or have various revolutionary organizations coordinate the work.

　　外出调查要力求节约
　　——革命群众来信述评
    各地红卫兵小将和广大革命群众，为了把党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派彻底斗倒、斗垮、斗臭，外出进行艰苦细致的调查工作。这是必要的。
    不过，根据目前某些单位的情况来看，在外出调查中，还没有认真执行毛主席“要节约闹革命”的伟大指示。有的单位没有统一的领导，各革命组织各自为政，各自派人离开生产岗位，外出搞调查。沈阳一读者来信说，有一个单位有三个群众组织，为了调查同一个材料，每个组织都派出两个人，没有参加革命组织的群众，也派两名代表参加，光路费就借支一千多元。天津一读者来信反映，有的革命组织，设立了几个调查小组，也不协同作战，本来去同一个地方调查，几个小组可以统一安排，节省人力、财力，可是非要自己去不可。这样，就出现同一单位的人员，同时去访问同一个对象的情况。北京一读者来信说，他们机关有一个同志，就分别接待过同一个单位数批人员谈同一个问题。
    有的读者还反映说，有的单位不是严肃认真地对待调查工作，调查之前，没有做好充分的准备，以致徒劳往返，耗费人力、财力。
    读者反映的这些情况，是一种严重的浪费行为。既耗费了国家大量财力，又大大增加了脱产人员；既影响本单位和外单位的革命和生产，又使交通运输以及其他方面加重了负担。
    因此，各单位和各革命组织，都要牢记毛主席“力求节省，用较少的钱办较多的事”的教导，外出调查，要政治挂帅，反对小团体主义和分散主义的做法。要互相合作，树立全局观念。并根据具体情况，或者建立统一的专案小组；或者各革命组织协商进行这一工作。
