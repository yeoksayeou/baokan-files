The First Vice Chairman of the Central Committee of the Burmese Communist Party, Ba Tin, said at a Beijing mass rally to mourn the martyr Liu Yi on July 5 that due to Ne Win firing the first shot against China, the armed struggle in Burma will definitely take a leap forward and enter a higher stage. This is because the current situation is that the armed struggle in Burma has the full sympathy and support of 700 million Chinese people. The vast majority of the Burmese people who oppose Ne Win will be more united.

In the future, the armed struggle in Burma will be more powerful and widespread, and more of Ne Win's government's troops will be annihilated. This is Ne Win digging his own grave.

We have been able to persist in nearly twenty years of armed struggle because we have taken Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought as our guide. The brilliant victories we have achieved in the military are the victories of the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

We have been able to persist in the struggle because we have established the thought of Chairman Mao that "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun." It is because we have used the gun to oppose the thought and program of the Chinese Khrushchev and the Soviet revisionist leadership group to cooperate with Ne Win and become Ne Win's disciples.

Our armed struggle began with the grasp of Chairman Mao's thought. As mentioned above, we not only accepted the completely correct thought of "political power grows out of the barrel of a gun," but also fought according to Chairman Mao's theory of using the countryside as a base and surrounding the cities with the countryside in a protracted war. Our practice has proven that as long as there is a party armed with Chairman Mao's thought, and this party can first rely on the peasants, then even in a small country like Burma, it is possible to wage a protracted war.

　　缅共中央第一副主席德钦巴登顶说缅人民武装斗争将发挥更大威力
    以毛泽东思想为指南进行持久战
    本报讯　缅共中央第一副主席德钦巴登顶五日在北京群众追悼刘逸烈士的大会上说：由于奈温开了反华的第一枪，缅甸的武装斗争必将出现飞跃的形势，走向更高的阶段，因为现在的时机是缅甸的武装斗争得到七亿中国人民的充分的同情和支持，反对奈温的绝大多数的缅甸人民将更加团结起来。
    今后的形势是缅甸的武装斗争将更加发挥它的威力，更加广泛，奈温政府的军队将被消灭得更多。这就是奈温自掘坟墓。
    我们所以能够坚持将近二十年的武装斗争，是由于我们以马克思列宁主义、毛泽东思想为指南。我们在军事上所取得的辉煌胜利，是战无不胜的毛泽东思想的胜利。
    我们所以能够坚持斗争，是由于我们树立了毛主席关于“枪杆子里面出政权”的思想，是由于我们使用了枪杆子、反对了中国的赫鲁晓夫和苏修领导集团要我们同奈温合作、并做奈温的门徒的思想和纲领的结果。
    我们的武装斗争是从掌握毛主席的思想开始的。如上所述，我们不仅是接受了“枪杆子里面出政权”这一完全正确的思想的指导，而且是按照毛主席以农村为根据地，农村包围城市这一持久战的理论进行战斗的。我们的实践证明，只要有一个用毛主席思想武装起来的党，这一个党首先又能依靠农民，那么，即使在象缅甸这样的小国，也是能够进行持久战的。
