In the current thunderous and surging wave of mass revolutionary criticism, the broad masses of workers, peasants, and soldiers are holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, carrying forward the spirit of thoroughly smashing fallen enemies, and launching a relentless attack on the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, as well as their lackeys. They are pursuing them vigorously, criticizing and struggling against them fiercely, fully demonstrating their role as the main force in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. They say: We workers, peasants, and soldiers were the most deeply exploited and oppressed in the old society. We hate the group of evil people within the Party, with China's Khrushchev as their representative, the most. We will resolutely expose this gang of poisonous snakes, not only to seize their power organizationally, but also to seize their power politically, ideologically, and theoretically. We will thoroughly criticize, overthrow, and expose them, sweep away all their rotten revisionist garbage, and ensure they never rise again!

Workers from various industrial and mining enterprises in Beijing, Shanghai, Tianjin, Harbin, Qingdao, Guiyang, and other places were filled with indignation after seeing the so-called "confession" written by the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, which is actually a counterattack. They said, our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "All reactionaries are paper tigers. In appearance, the reactionaries are terrific, but in reality, they are not so powerful." We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings and thoroughly overthrow the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road politically, ideologically, and theoretically. If we do not thoroughly overthrow them, these poisonous snakes will find opportunities to stage a comeback and return to power. Then, proletarian dictatorship will be turned into bourgeois dictatorship, and the heads of millions of people will roll!

In recent days, revolutionary workers have been using their pens as weapons, turning their workshops into battlefields, writing big-character posters, writing critical articles, holding criticism meetings, struggle meetings, and denunciation meetings, launching a great criticism, exposure, and struggle against China's Khrushchev and his agents in various places. They proudly declare: The working class must be the vanguard of the great criticism and the pillar of defending proletarian dictatorship. In the old society, we suffered the most from the exploitation and oppression of the capitalists, so we have the deepest hatred for the old society, we understand best what it means to be exploited, and we know best what capitalists are like. The biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road advocate things like "exploitation is beneficial" and "capitalists feed workers," all of which are nonsense and reactionary fallacies. They want to restore capitalism and make us retrace our steps, suffer twice, but we workers will not agree to this, not in a thousand or ten thousand ways! We will definitely wield the heavy hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, criticize them deeply and thoroughly politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and overthrow and expose them. The head of the Revolutionary Committee of Shanghai Ink Factory, Shen Yuhe, was an orphan sold at the age of eight in the old society, suffering greatly from the exploitation system. It was Chairman Mao who made this orphan, who was bullied in the old society, the master of the state. He has boundless love for Chairman Mao, boundless love for socialism, boundless hatred for China's Khrushchev, and boundless hatred for the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are trying to restore capitalism. He said: We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, swing our iron fists, smash China's Khrushchev to pieces, and clean up the revisionist poison he spread in the industry, so that the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought can firmly take root in the factories, turning the factories into red Mao Zedong Thought universities, ensuring that our iron-clad socialist state will never change color!

Peasants from Shanxi, Shandong, Heilongjiang, Guizhou, Qinghai, Inner Mongolia, and Shaanxi provinces are holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism of Mao Zedong Thought, criticizing and struggling fiercely against China's Khrushchev, pursuing them vigorously. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai Brigade, Dazhai Commune, Xiyang County, Shanxi Province, have firmly resisted the revisionist goods advocated by the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road, such as "three autonomies and one contract" and "four freedoms," and have firmly advanced along Chairman Mao's revolutionary line. Today, in the great criticism, they are determined to thoroughly purge the poison spread by the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road and advance even more vigorously. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Dazhai said indignantly, the number one power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road has, for decades, waved the red flag to oppose the red flag, advocated capitalism, said and did all kinds of evil things, and is our sworn enemy. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary masses pulled him down from his horse and exposed his reactionary face, but he is still alive and his heart is not dead, still struggling desperately. We must follow Chairman Mao's teachings: "It is advisable to use the remaining courage to pursue the fleeing enemy," carry forward the spirit of thoroughly smashing fallen enemies, and thoroughly overthrow him, making him stink for a thousand years. The poor and lower-middle peasants of Xigou Brigade, Xigou Commune, Pingshun County, Shanxi Province, where the famous agricultural labor model Li Shunda is located, have, according to Chairman Mao's May 7th Directive, carried forward the spirit of the poor and lower-middle peasants being masters, criticizing and struggling fiercely against the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. They said, wolves are wolves, and they cannot change their nature of eating people. We will not let go of the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. We workers, peasants, and soldiers are the masters of the new society and the main force of the great criticism. We will definitely wield the heavy hammer of Mao Zedong Thought, overthrow and expose the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road, and make them never rise again! In the great criticism movement, the members of Chaka Commune, Wulan County, Qinghai Province, concentrated their firepower to criticize the variant of "three autonomies and one contract" in pastoral areas proposed by China's Khrushchev, the "two fixes and one reward" system. They used Mao Zedong Thought as a mirror to expose the various evil consequences of promoting "two fixes and one reward" in the past few years, such as corrupting the thoughts of the members and destroying the collective economy. They said, we must thoroughly purge the poison of the revisionist line promoted by China's Khrushchev and turn our commune into a red Mao Zedong Thought university.

The broad ranks of officers and soldiers of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, with boundless love for our red sun, Chairman Mao, in our hearts, and deep hatred for China's Khrushchev and his agents in the army, are holding criticism and denunciation meetings one after another, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon to criticize and struggle fiercely against the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road. Many units have entered factories, rural areas, and schools, joining the broad revolutionary masses in launching a great criticism and struggle against China's Khrushchev. The First Company of a certain unit in the Beijing area, which is currently under construction, brought the blackboard newspaper criticizing China's Khrushchev to the construction site, propagating the great significance of the great criticism, and criticizing with the workers. Through the criticism, the broad cadres and soldiers have an even deeper love for Chairman Mao and Mao Zedong Thought, further recognizing the wolfish ambitions of China's Khrushchev. A "five-good" soldier, Song Zhenguo, of the Fifth Company of a certain unit said, China's Khrushchev and his big and small lackeys have countless crimes, but the most fundamental evil is opposing our red sun, Chairman Mao, in our hearts, and the boundless light of Mao Zedong Thought. We must firmly grasp our rifles, take up our pens, carry forward the spirit of thoroughly smashing fallen enemies, and with the courage to see blood on the bayonet, thoroughly overthrow and expose the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road politically, ideologically, and theoretically, and swear to carry the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution to the end!

On July 21, the revolutionary masses of the various general departments of the Chinese People's Liberation Army, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, and the PLA units stationed in Beijing held a criticism meeting, angrily denouncing the biggest group of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road.

    决心从政治思想理论上彻底夺党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的权，使他们遗臭万年，永世不得翻身
    新华社二十二日讯　在当前雷霆万钧、汹涌澎湃的群众性的革命大批判的高潮中，广大工农兵群众高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，发扬痛打落水狗的彻底革命精神，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派及其爪牙，穷追猛打，狠批狠斗，充分地显示出他们在文化大革命中的主力军的伟大作用。他们说：我们工农兵在旧社会受剥削最深，受压迫最重，对以中国的赫鲁晓夫为总代表的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，我们最恨。我们坚决把这伙毒蛇一样的恶人彻底揭露出来，不仅要从组织上夺他们的权，还要从政治上、思想上、理论上夺他们的权，把他们彻底批倒、批垮、批臭，彻底清扫他们这些腐朽的修正主义的垃圾，叫他们永世不得翻身！
    北京、上海、天津、哈尔滨、青岛、贵阳等地工矿企业的广大革命工人看到党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派抛出来的名为“认罪”、实为反攻的“检查”书后，人人义愤填膺。他们说，伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“凡是反动的东西，你不打，他就不倒。”我们一定要遵循毛主席的教导，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派从政治上、思想上、理论上彻底打倒。如果不把他们彻底打倒，这些毒蛇一样的恶人，就有可能寻找机会复辟，重新上台，那么就会变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政，千百万人头就会落地。
    广大革命工人连日来以笔作刀枪、车间当战场，写大字报，写批判文章，开批判大会、斗争会、控诉会，对中国的赫鲁晓夫及其在各地的代理人展开了大批判、大揭露、大斗争。他们豪迈地说：我们工人阶级一定要做大批判的急先锋，作捍卫无产阶级专政的顶梁柱，因为我们在旧社会受尽了资本家的剥削压迫，对旧社会的仇恨最深，最懂得受剥削是什么滋味，最懂得资本家是什么东西。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派宣扬什么“剥削有功”，什么“资本家养活工人”，这统统都是胡说八道，统统都是反动谬论。他们妄想复辟资本主义，让我们走回头路，吃二遍苦，我们工人一千个不答应，一万个不答应！我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，从政治上、思想上、理论上把他们批深批透，斗倒斗臭。上海油墨厂革命委员会负责人沈于和，在旧社会是一个六岁就死去父母，八岁就被贩卖的孤儿，受尽了剥削制度的摧残。是毛主席使这个旧社会备受欺压的孤儿成了国家的主人。他对毛主席无比热爱，对社会主义无比热爱，对中国的赫鲁晓夫无比仇恨，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派妄图复辟资本主义无比仇恨。他说：我们一定要高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，抡起铁拳，把中国的赫鲁晓夫砸个稀巴烂，把他在工业方面散布的修正主义流毒扫除干净，使光焰无际的毛泽东思想在工厂中牢牢地扎下根，把工厂办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想大学校，保证我们铁打的社会主义江山世世代代永不变色！
    山西、山东、黑龙江、贵州、青海、内蒙古、陕西等地广大贫下中农，高举毛泽东思想的革命的批判旗帜，对中国的赫鲁晓夫狠批狠斗，穷追猛打。山西省昔阳县大寨公社大寨大队的贫下中农社员在过去几年间，就坚决抵制党内头号走资本主义道路当权派鼓吹的“三自一包”、“四大自由”等一套修正主义货色，坚决地沿着毛主席的革命路线阔步前进。今天，在革命的大批判中，他们决心彻底肃清党内头号走资本主义道路当权派散布的流毒，更加阔步地前进。大寨贫下中农义愤填膺地说，党内头号走资本主义道路当权派，几十年来，打着红旗反红旗，大搞资本主义复辟，坏话说尽，坏事干尽，他是我们不共戴天的敌人。在无产阶级文化大革命中，无产阶级革命派把他拉下马，揭露了他的反动面目，但他人还在，心不死，还在作垂死的挣扎，我们一定要遵照毛主席的教导：“宜将剩勇追穷寇”，发扬痛打落水狗的革命精神，把他彻底打翻在地，让他遗臭万年。全国著名农业劳动模范李顺达所在的山西平顺县西沟公社西沟大队的贫下中农，根据毛主席“五·七”指示，发扬贫下中农当家作主的精神，狠批猛批党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派。他们说，狼毕竟是狼，它改不了吃人的本性，我们决不会放过党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，我们工农兵是新社会的主人，是革命大批判的主力军，我们一定要奋起毛泽东思想的千钧棒，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派批倒斗臭，叫他永世不得翻身！青海省乌兰县茶卡公社的社员在大批判运动中，集中火力批判了中国的赫鲁晓夫提出的
  “三自一包”在牧区的变种“两定一奖”制。他们用毛泽东思想作为照妖镜，揭发了前几年推行“两定一奖”所产生的腐蚀社员思想、破坏集体经济等种种恶果。他们说，我们一定要彻底肃清中国的赫鲁晓夫推行的修正主义路线的流毒，把我们的公社办成红彤彤的毛泽东思想的大学校。
    守卫在祖国各地的中国人民解放军广大指战员，怀着对我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席无限热爱，对中国的赫鲁晓夫和他在军队里的代理人的刻骨仇恨，纷纷举行批判声讨大会，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想作武器，对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行狠揭狠批。许多部队走进工厂、农村、学校，和广大革命群众共同向中国的赫鲁晓夫展开大批判、大斗争。北京地区正在施工的某部红一连把批判中国的赫鲁晓夫的黑板报抬到工地上，宣传大批判的伟大意义，和工人一起进行批判。通过批判，广大干部战士对毛主席和毛泽东思想更加热爱，进一步认清了中国的赫鲁晓夫的狼子野心。某部五连“五好”战士宋振国说，中国的赫鲁晓夫和他们大小爪牙千条罪万条罪，最根本的罪恶就是反对我们心中最红最红的红太阳毛主席和光焰无际的毛泽东思想。我们一定要紧握手中枪，拿起笔杆子，发扬痛打落水狗的彻底革命精神，以“刺刀见红”的杀敌之勇，把党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派从政治上、思想上、理论上，彻底批倒斗臭，誓把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
