At the burial site, leaders of the Party, state, and military of Vietnam took the coffin from the hearse.

Comrade Le Duc Tho, member of the Political Bureau of the Party Central Committee and chairman of the funeral committee, read the eulogy, expressing the deep sorrow of the Vietnamese Party, people, and armed forces over the passing of Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh.

The eulogy said: At this moment when our entire nation and soldiers are achieving brilliant victories and the sacred struggle against American imperialism is at a critical juncture, the passing of Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh is a great loss to our Party, our army, and our people.

Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh dedicated his life to the glorious revolutionary cause of the Party and the nation.

He was born in January 1914 in the village of Nham Phuong, Quang Dien District, Thua Thien Province, in a poor peasant family. Due to his early revolutionary awareness, he joined the Party's ranks at a young age and actively participated in activities against imperialism and the feudal landlord class during the days when French colonialists brutally suppressed our revolutionary movement.

In the eight years since he became a member of the Indochina Communist Party, Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh served as the secretary of the Party branch and the secretary of the Thua Thien Provincial Committee. He was arrested by imperialists three times. During his revolutionary struggle and imprisonment by imperialists, he always showed himself to be a steadfast and loyal Communist Party member who was fearless in danger and unwavering in the face of difficulties. During this period, he contributed to the establishment of Party grassroots organizations and the promotion of the revolutionary movement in Thua Thien Province.

Due to his firm will and unwavering loyalty to the revolutionary cause, Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh threw himself into the struggle with all his passion and wisdom and grew in the people's revolutionary movement led by our Party.

In August 1945, he was elected as a full member of the Central Committee and was appointed by the Central Committee as the secretary of the Central Committee of the Middle Region. From 1947 to 1948, the Central Committee appointed him as the secretary of the Thua Thien Provincial Committee and the secretary of the Quang Binh-Quang Tri-Thua Thien Interzone Committee.

At that time, the anti-French war in the Middle Region was facing difficulties. The enemy concentrated their forces here for fierce attacks. Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh did not disappoint the Central Committee's trust in him. Together with other comrades of the Party Committee, he led the people to rise up, restore and develop political organizations, vigorously promote guerrilla warfare, and turned the situation around, laying the foundation for the brilliant victory of the anti-French war in the Quang Binh-Quang Tri-Thua Thien region.

From the end of 1948 to 1950, Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh was the secretary of the Interzone Committee of the Fourth Interzone, contributing to the leadership of the entire military and people of the interzone in unity, fighting, and production, vigorously promoting the anti-war cause and building a solid rear area.

In 1950, when our nation's anti-French war was entering a fierce stage, the Party assigned Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh to the military and appointed him as the director of the General Political Department and deputy secretary of the General Military Commission. The Party's Second National Congress elected him as a full member of the Central Committee and a member of the Political Bureau. During this period, he devoted himself wholeheartedly to leading the people's armed forces to implement the Party's strategic will, fight, and achieve one great victory after another, finally defeating the French colonialists and American interveners in the historic Dien Bien Phu campaign. Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh made great contributions in consolidating the Party's leadership over the military, building the military politically, ideologically, and organizationally, cultivating and promoting the revolutionary qualities of our army, formulating political work methods, and rapidly improving the combat effectiveness of the people's armed forces. He often cared about educating and training a strong cadre force to meet the increasing revolutionary tasks.

In the years after the restoration of peace, Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh made active contributions to building our strong army, firmly defending the socialist construction in the North, and struggling for the unification of the Fatherland.

The eulogy said: Since the American imperialists armed invasion of our country, due to his virtues and talents, the Party assigned Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh to participate in the leadership of the military again and made great contributions. He proved to be an outstanding leader, dedicating all his talents and willpower to the struggle for the victory of the Party's political and military lines. He made many contributions to the development of our Party's people's war military art, powerfully mobilizing the fighting spirit of our military and people, and contributing to the great victories achieved in the struggle against American imperialism in recent times.

The eulogy said: Our dear Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh is an extremely steadfast and absolutely loyal Communist warrior to the revolutionary cause of the Party. He has always had the spirit of fiercely attacking the class and national enemies. Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh is a comrade with a high sense of responsibility and revolutionary enthusiasm, with many creative achievements in his work, a comrade who is very humble, simple, studious, united, and sincerely cares for comrades and fellow soldiers.

Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh has excellent revolutionary qualities. He can complete all tasks assigned by the Party Central Committee, the Government, the Central Military Commission, and the General Staff excellently in any difficult and complex environment; he is worthy of the Party's trust and gains the unlimited love of our people and army.

The eulogy said: Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh has passed away, but his spirit, together with the glorious revolutionary cause of the Party, the nation, and the armed forces of our country, will be immortal!

The eulogy finally called on every member, cadre, and soldier of the Vietnam Labor Party to strive to learn from Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh's noble revolutionary morality, especially his thorough revolutionary spirit, brave and decisive spirit, attacking and creative spirit; learn from his upright, sincere, caring for comrades and fellow soldiers, humble, and modest style.

The eulogy also called on everyone to turn grief into strength, devote all spirit and strength to the struggle against American imperialism, resolutely defeat the American aggressors, liberate the South, defend the North, unify the Fatherland, continue to complete the socialist construction cause, and achieve the current most sacred fighting goal of the Vietnamese people and the Vietnamese Party, which is also Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh's lifelong lofty ideal.

All comrades present held a moment of silence. Then, the leaders of the Vietnamese Party, state, and military buried the soil for the final resting place of Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh and bid farewell to Comrade Nguyen Chi Thanh.

    党中央政治局委员、治丧委员会主任黎德寿宣读悼词，表示越南党、人民和人民武装力量对阮志清同志逝世的无限哀悼。
    悼词说：正当我们全国同胞和战士取得辉煌胜利，在神圣的抗美救国事业处于关键时刻，阮志清同志的逝世，是我党、我军和我国人民的一个重大损失。
    阮志清同志为党和民族的光荣的革命事业贡献了他的一生。
    他在一九一四年一月一日生于承天省广田县念放村的一个贫农家里。由于很早就有了革命觉悟，他在年青的时候就参加了党的队伍，并在法国殖民主义者对我国革命运动进行血腥镇压的日子里，踊跃地参加反对帝国主义和封建地主阶级统治的活动。
    从他成为印度支那共产党党员以后的八年中，阮志清同志曾担任党支部书记和承天省省委书记。他曾经遭到帝国主义的三次逮捕。在进行革命斗争和被帝国主义监禁的日子里，他一直表现出是一个临危不惧，见难不退的坚定和忠诚的共产党员。在这时期，他为建立党的基层组织和促进承天省的革命运动作出了贡献。
    由于具有坚定的意志，对革命事业的无限忠诚，阮志清同志以他所有的热情和智慧投身到战斗中去，并在我们党所领导的人民革命运动中成长起来。
    一九四五年八月，他被选为正式中央委员，并被中央指派为中圻委员会书记。在一九四七年到一九四八年期间，中央指派他为承天省委书记和广平—广治—承天分区区委书记。
    当时，中部中区的抗法战争正遇到困难。敌人集中力量在这里进行猛烈攻击。阮志清同志没有辜负中央对他的委托。他和党委的其他同志一起领导人民揭竿而起，恢复和发展政治组织，大力推动游击战争，扭转了局势，为广平—广治—承天抗战运动的辉煌胜利打下了基础。
    从一九四八年年底到一九五○年，阮志清同志是第四联区的联区区委书记，为领导联区全体军民团结战斗、生产，大力推动抗战事业和建设稳固后方作出了贡献。
    一九五○年，正当我国全民反对法国殖民者的抗战进入激烈的阶段时，党调阮志清同志到军队中并委任他当总政治局主任、总军委副书记的职务。党的第二次全国代表大会选他为正式中央委员，并选入政治局。在这个时期里，他全心全力地和党中央、总军委的其他领导同志一起，直接领导人民武装力量实现党的战略决心，进行战斗，取得一个又一个巨大胜利，最后在具有历史意义的奠边府战役中打败了法国殖民主义者和美国干涉者。阮志清同志在为巩固党对军队的领导，从政治、思想和组织上建设军队，培养和发扬我军的革命品质，制订政治工作方法，迅速提高人民武装的战斗力等方面立下了大功。他经常关心教育和培养出一支强大的干部队伍，以满足与日俱增的革命任务的需要。
    在和平恢复以后的年月里，阮志清同志在为建设我们强大的军队，牢固保卫北方社会主义建设事业和争取统一祖国的斗争中，作出了积极的贡献。
    悼词说，自从美帝国主义武装侵略我国以后，由于他的德才，党又调阮志清同志再次参加军队的领导工作，并且作出了巨大贡献。他表现出是一个出色的领导者，把全部才能和毅力为胜利实现党的政治和军事路线而奋斗。他对发展我们党的人民战争的军事艺术作出了许多贡献，有力地动员了我国军民的战斗精神，为抗美救国战斗事业在最近期间所取得的巨大胜利作出了贡献。
    悼词说：我们亲爱的阮志清同志是一位无比坚强、绝对忠诚于党的革命事业的共产主义战士。他一贯具有猛烈进攻阶级和民族的一切敌人的精神。阮志清同志是一位具有高度责任感和革命热情、在工作中有许多创造性的同志，是一位很谦逊、朴素、好学、团结、无比真诚地爱护同志和战友的人。
    阮志清同志具有优良的革命品质。他无论在任何困难和复杂的环境中，都能出色地完成党中央、政府、中央军事委员会和总司令部交给的一切任务；他无愧于党对他的信任，获得我国人民和军队的无限爱戴。
    悼词说，阮志清同志逝世了，但他的精神，同党的、民族的和我国人民武装力量的光辉革命事业一起，永垂不朽！
    悼词最后号召越南劳动党每一个党员、干部、战士都要努力学习阮志清同志高尚的革命道德，特别是学习他彻底革命的精神、勇敢和坚决的精神、进攻和创造的精神；学习他的刚直、真诚、爱护同志、爱护战友的性格以及朴素、谦逊的作风。
    悼词还号召大家化悲痛为力量，把一切精神和力量投入抗美救国斗争，坚决战胜美国侵略强盗，解放南方，保卫北方，统一祖国，继续完成社会主义建设事业，胜利地实现越南人民、越南党当前最神圣的战斗目标，也是阮志清同志毕生的崇高理想。
    在场的全体同志举行了默哀。接着，越南党、国家和军队领导人为阮志清同志最后安息的地方培土，向阮志清同志告别。（附图片）
