The artists of the Somali Artistic Delegation expressed their love for our great leader Chairman Mao and praised the friendship between the peoples of China and Somalia through their performances of songs and dances from both countries this evening.

The crimson curtain opened to reveal a sky filled with golden rays, casting light upon the image of Chairman Mao, the red sun in the hearts of the people of the world. The Somali artists, holding the "Quotations from Chairman Mao," sang with deep emotion in front of Chairman Mao's portrait, performing the Somali song "Praise to Chairman Mao" and Chinese songs "The East is Red," "The Ship Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman," and "Long Live Chairman Mao." The song "Long Live Chairman Mao," which they had just learned this afternoon, was met with wave after wave of enthusiastic applause from the audience.

During the intermission, Premier Zhou Enlai and Vice Premier Li Fuchun met with the delegation leader Jama Harar and all the performers, engaging in warm and friendly conversation. The Somali artists told Premier Zhou and Vice Premier Li that they deeply love Chairman Mao and spontaneously sang "The Ship Sails on the Sea Depending on the Helmsman."

Vice Premier Li Fuchun and relevant officials watched the performance by the Somali artists this evening.

As the performance concluded, the Somali artists held the flags of both China and Somalia and sang "The East is Red" in Chinese once again.
