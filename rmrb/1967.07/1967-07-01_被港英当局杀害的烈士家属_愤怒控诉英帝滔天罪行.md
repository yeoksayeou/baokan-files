Families of martyrs killed by the British authorities in Hong Kong held a press conference on June 29, expressing their profound grief and anger. They denounced the heinous crimes of British imperialism in killing Chinese workers and vowed to demand justice from the British authorities in Hong Kong.

At the press conference, the families of the martyrs presented five stern demands to the British authorities:

1. The cause of death of the martyrs must be made public within one week.
2. A permanent cemetery must be allocated to bury the martyrs together, and a memorial monument must be erected.
3. The British authorities must not interfere with or obstruct the Hong Kong and Kowloon people from all walks of life in their struggle against British oppression and in their demand to hold a funeral for the martyrs.
4. The murderers must be handed over and severely punished.
5. All losses must be compensated.

Lai Song and Zhou Songsheng, families of the martyrs, angrily pointed out at the conference that after killing their relatives, the British authorities have refused to disclose the cause of death and attempted to destroy the evidence and obstruct the families from retrieving the bodies for burial. This is adding insult to injury. The families sternly declared that the British authorities owe them a blood debt, and no matter how much they delay and deceive, they cannot escape their responsibility. There is a debt of blood, and it must be repaid in blood! The mother of Zhang Ming, a martyr, and the family of Xu Tianbo, another martyr, also denounced the crimes of British imperialism at the conference and vowed to stand with all Hong Kong compatriots to fight British imperialism to the end and avenge their loved ones. The family of Deng Ziqiang, a rubber worker who was shot dead by British police during the suppression of the Hong Kong and Kowloon Rubber and Plastic Workers' Union, wept as they angrily denounced the crimes of the British authorities. They sternly demanded that the British authorities immediately hand over the murderers and severely punish them; otherwise, the people of Hong Kong will not rest.

On June 29, the wife of Li An, a worker at the Shaw Brothers Studio who was beaten to death by the British authorities on June 26, attended a memorial service held by the film industry after participating in the press conference. She also told reporters about the bloody crimes committed by the British authorities in killing her husband.

　　被港英当局杀害的烈士家属
　　愤怒控诉英帝滔天罪行
    据新华社香港三十日电　被港英当局杀害的反英抗暴烈士的家属们，六月二十九日举行记者招待会，怀着万分悲愤的心情，在会上控诉了英帝杀害中国工人的滔天罪行，坚决表示要向港英当局讨还血债。
    在记者招待会上，烈士家属们向港英当局提出五项严正要求：
    一、必须在一个星期内公布烈士死因；二、拨出永久坟场把烈士们安葬于同一个坟场内，并建筑纪念碑；三、不得干涉和阻挠港九各界同胞反对港英迫害斗争委员会为烈士举行葬礼的要求；四、交出并严惩杀人凶手；五、赔偿一切损失。
    黎松、邹松胜等烈士家属在会上愤慨指出：港英当局杀害了我们的亲人以后，一直不敢公布死因并企图毁尸灭迹，阻挠家属领取烈士遗体进行安葬，这是罪上加罪。家属们严正指出：港英当局欠下我们的血债，无论怎样拖延蒙混都是抵赖不了的，冤有头，债有主，血债一定要血来偿还！曾明烈士的母亲和徐田波烈士的家属也在会上控诉了港英帝国主义的罪行，表示誓与全港同胞站在一起，与英帝国主义战斗到底，为亲人报仇。在港英武装镇压九龙树胶塑胶总工会时，被港英警察明目张胆地当场开枪打死的树胶工人邓自强烈士的家属，在会上含着眼泪愤怒控诉港英当局的罪行，并且严正要求港英当局必须立即交出杀人凶手，并且严加惩办，否则香港同胞决不罢休。
    二十六日被港英当局活活打死的邵氏制片厂工人李安烈士的妻子，二十九日在参加电影界举行的烈士追悼会后，也向记者控诉了港英当局杀害她丈夫的血腥罪行。
