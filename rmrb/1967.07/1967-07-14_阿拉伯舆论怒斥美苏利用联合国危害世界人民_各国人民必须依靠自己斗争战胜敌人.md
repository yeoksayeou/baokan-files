Arab public opinion is furiously denouncing the collusion between the U.S. and the Soviet Union in the United Nations to betray the interests of the Arab people. It is also pointed out that the United Nations has degenerated into a tool used by the U.S. and the Soviet Union to harm the interests of the peoples of various countries.

An Algerian worker indignantly said: "The United Nations has reached the point where it does not even verbally condemn Israel's aggression against Arab countries. We are not surprised by this, because the United Nations is a tool used by big countries like the United States and the Soviet Union to harm the peoples of various countries. Everyone can clearly see that the United Nations has never done a single good thing for the exploited and invaded peoples." This worker also pointed out: "To resist the American imperialists and Zionists, we must wage guerrilla warfare."

The weekly magazine "Algerian Reality" published an article on July 9th discussing how to deal with Israeli Zionism, stating: "The true solution has always been decided on the battlefield. For a just cause, the only way to deal with force is to use force." The magazine went on to say: "The youth and people of Algeria are eager to join the battle, ready to make every sacrifice to reclaim Arab land."

The Algerian News Agency recently published a commentary stating that this United Nations conference has proven the complete bankruptcy of the United Nations. The agency said that the peoples and governments of Asia and Africa must strengthen their front against American and British imperialism, the two main culprits behind the current Arab situation.

The Arab Lawyers Union recently issued a statement pointing out that the United Nations has not made any resolutions condemning the aggression of the United States, Britain, and Israel against Arab countries or ordering the aggressors to withdraw. This clearly shows that international imperialism, led by the United States, continues to control the United Nations, making the United Nations serve its own aggressive policies, strangling the independence and freedom of the peoples of various countries, and striking at liberation movements around the world. The statement emphasized that in the struggle against aggression, the Arab people must first rely on themselves, strengthen unity, and defeat the enemy.

The Cairo "News" published an editorial on July 7th stating that the United States is attempting to dominate the world through manipulation of the United Nations, imposing its own will on the entire world.

The editorial pointed out: The United Nations has been abandoned by the peoples of the world, and the United States has become isolated among the peoples of the world.

    阿拉伯舆论怒斥美苏利用联合国危害世界人民
    各国人民必须依靠自己斗争战胜敌人
    新华社讯　阿拉伯国家公众舆论愤怒谴责美、苏勾结在联合国出卖阿拉伯人民利益的罪行，并且指出，联合国已经堕落成美苏用来损害世界各国人民利益的工具。
    一个阿尔及利亚工人愤慨地说：“联合国已经达到了连口头上都不谴责以色列对阿拉伯国家的侵略的地步。我们对此并不感到惊讶，因为联合国是象美国和苏联那样的大国用来危害世界各国人民的工具。大家都清楚地看到，联合国从来没有为被剥削和被侵略的人民做过一件好事。”这位工人还指出：“要抗击美帝国主义者和犹太复国主义者，就得进行游击战争”。
    《阿尔及利亚现实》周刊九日就如何对付以色列的犹太复国主义发表文章说：“真正的解决办法始终是在战场上见分晓。只要是正义的事业，对付武力的唯一手段始终是使用武力”。这家周刊接着说：“阿尔及利亚的青年和人民一心希望投入战斗，为收复阿拉伯的土地准备作出一切牺牲。”
    阿尔及利亚新闻社最近发表评论说，这次联合国会议证明了联合国的彻底破产。这家通讯社说，亚非各国人民和政府必须加强反对美英帝国主义的阵线，反对美英帝国主义这两个造成目前阿拉伯局势的罪魁祸首。
    阿拉伯律师联合会最近发表声明指出，联合国没有作出谴责美国、英国和以色列对阿拉伯国家的侵略或命令侵略者撤走的决议，这清楚表明，以美国为首的国际帝国主义继续控制着联合国，使联合国为它们自己的侵略政策效劳，扼杀各国人民的独立和自由，并且打击世界各地的解放运动。声明强调说，阿拉伯人民在反侵略斗争中，必须首先依靠自己，加强团结，战胜敌人。
    开罗《消息报》七日发表社论指出，美国企图通过操纵联合国来主宰世界，把它自己的意志强加于全世界。
    社论指出：联合国已为世界各国人民所抛弃，美国在世界人民中间，已经处于孤立。
