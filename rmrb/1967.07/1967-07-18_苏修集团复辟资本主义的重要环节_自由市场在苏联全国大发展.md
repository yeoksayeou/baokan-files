	Editor's Note: In the Soviet Union, fifty years after the October Revolution, capitalist-style free markets are ubiquitous. In these markets, goods are piled high, and people bustle about, in stark contrast to the desolation of state-run stores. These free markets are irrefutable evidence of the Soviet revisionist clique's restoration of capitalism!

	Lenin pointed out: "...small-scale production constantly, daily, spontaneously, and on a mass scale, generates capitalism and the bourgeoisie." "And these small proprietors, through their daily, petty, and imperceptible corrupting activities, create the ills that the bourgeoisie needs to restore itself."

	Lenin and Stalin had led the small-scale producers in the Soviet countryside onto the bright path of collectivization. After seizing power, this gang of revisionist traitors not only squandered this great achievement but also went to great lengths to facilitate small-scale production and give the green light to capitalism.

	The Soviet revisionist leadership treats the restoration of capitalism as state policy. To meet the needs of the bourgeoisie they represent, they implement the capitalist policy of "profit above all." They eagerly seek to open new channels for "free trade." With one order on the left and one directive on the right, they vigorously promote so-called "liberalization" in the countryside, advocating the division of land among collectives, relaxing restrictions on private plots, providing loans and other conveniences for the development of personal sideline production, and so on. Therefore, in today's Soviet countryside, free enterprise and free competition are rampant, making it virtually a capitalist world.

	The Soviet revisionist leadership spares no effort to develop free markets, even going so far as to worry about the convenience of farmers' transportation to free markets. As a result, some people become rich, while the broad masses are exploited; collective agriculture is destroyed and disintegrated, and new bourgeois elements emerge in droves. The Soviet agricultural economy, like the industrial economy that implements the so-called "new system" with profit as the center, has long since become a pure capitalist commodity. The Soviet revisionist leadership is walking further and further down the road of restoring capitalism. Yet they have the audacity to claim that they are "building communism," truly a case of hanging a sheep's head to sell dog meat, shamelessly deceiving the world!

	The Soviet Revisionists' Key Step in Restoring Capitalism: The Widespread Development of Free Markets in the Soviet Union

	The Soviet revisionist leadership's important step in restoring capitalism is to vigorously develop capitalist free markets and free competition in urban and rural areas. Recently, an article discussing the "kolkhoz" free markets in the Soviet Union, published in the Soviet Union's _Statistical Bulletin_, revealed some information on this matter.

	Free Markets Everywhere

	The article reveals that the scale of free markets in the Soviet Union is enormous and they are ubiquitous. In addition to these large-scale free markets, there are also many uncountable so-called "spontaneous markets," where vendors and customers gather at irregular times.

	The article states: "In 1965, an average of more than 17 million people per month sold their products in kolkhoz markets. Of course, there are even more customers."

	"By March 15, 1966, there were 7,260 kolkhoz markets, of which 5,053 were in cities and urban-type settlements, 960 were in the capitals of states, territories, and republics, and 2,207 were in rural areas. Thus, kolkhoz commerce is mainly urban commerce."

	According to its statistics, in addition to kolkhoz markets, there are also 142 markets where industrial enterprises sell their products, of which 70 are in states, territories, and republic capitals.

	Large Quantities of Food from Free Markets

	The statistical figures in this article reflect that due to the Soviet revisionist leadership's vigorous promotion of capitalist free enterprise and free competition, many cities in the Soviet Union now rely more and more on free markets for their food supply.

	"The kolkhoz markets play a particularly prominent role in supplying residents with potatoes, vegetables, fruits, and eggs. For example, residents of Alma-Ata, Saratov, Balashov, Dnipropetrovsk, Tbilisi, Yerevan, and Odessa buy 55% to 80% of their potatoes from kolkhoz markets. In almost all these cities, 30% to 70% of the vegetables residents buy come from kolkhoz markets. In Michurinsk, Balashov, Zaporozhye, Chernovtsy, Ashkhabad, Kishinev, and other cities, the eggs sold in kolkhoz markets account for 20% to 40% of the eggs supplied to residents; and nearly half of the eggs residents in Odessa buy come from kolkhoz markets."

	"In many cities, 25% to 40% of the meat residents buy comes from markets."

	Official Investment and Support

	The article boasts that the Soviet revisionist leadership, through decrees, invests huge sums of money to build "modern, well-equipped large-scale free markets," creating all the conveniences for capitalist operations.

	The article states that the Soviet revisionist leadership abolished the practice of including a significant portion of market fees in the state budget before 1966, "creating tremendous possibilities" for building free markets or updating equipment. "Now, this money can be used entirely for operating, expanding kolkhoz markets, and improving market facilities. The Councils of Ministers of the Union Republics have the authority to allow kolkhoz markets to establish funds to improve the cultural living conditions of market workers. These funds are quite substantial, and using them accurately can greatly improve the facilities of kolkhoz markets and more broadly develop kolkhoz commerce."

	Encouraging Further Development

	To meet the need for a comprehensive restoration of capitalism, the Soviet revisionist clique is essentially encouraging the unlimited development of "private sideline production" in cities and rural areas and encouraging more people to do business in free markets. This article from the _Statistical Bulletin_ is manufactured to create public opinion for this purpose.

	The article advocates: "Currently, there are very favorable conditions for further developing kolkhoz markets. Kolkhoz members, workers, and employees are increasingly and regularly selling their products in markets. The growth in the turnover of kolkhoz markets also reflects the growth of sideline products of kolkhoz members, workers, and employees."

	The article shouts: "The resolution of the 23rd Congress of the CPSU stipulates that the trading of kolkhoz markets should be significantly improved, and various conditions should be established to enable kolkhoz to more broadly participate in free markets to sell agricultural products."

	Facts speak louder than words. The facts revealed in this article from the Soviet Union's _Statistical Bulletin_ show: The so-called "construction of communism" propagated by the Soviet revisionist leadership is a complete lie; while the thorough restoration of capitalism is their state policy.

### 苏修集团复辟资本主义的重要环节  自由市场在苏联全国大发展

专栏：看苏修怎样在国内复辟资本主义

    编者按：在十月革命五十年后的苏联，资本主义性质的自由市场，遍布全国。在这些市场上，货物堆积，熙熙攘攘，同挂着社会主义经济招牌的国营商店那种萧条景象，形成了鲜明的对比。这种自由市场，就是苏修叛徒集团复辟资本主义的一个铁证！
    列宁指出：“……小生产是经常地、每日每时地、自发地和大批地产生着资本主义和资产阶级的。”“而这些小业主用他们日常的、琐碎的、看不见摸不着的腐化活动制造着为资产阶级所需要的，使资产阶级得以复辟的恶果”。
    列宁、斯大林曾把苏联农村小生产者引上集体化的光明大道。苏修这一伙叛徒篡夺政权后，不仅断送了这一伟大成果，并且千方百计为小生产者大开方便之门，为资本主义大放绿灯。
    苏修领导集团把复辟资本主义当作国策。他们为了自己所代表的资产阶级的需要，实行资本主义“唯利是图”的方针，热中于开辟“自由贸易”的新渠道。他们左一道命令，右一项指示，在农村大力推行所谓“自由化”，提倡分田到组，放宽对自留地的限制，为发展个人副业提供贷款和其他便利，等等。因此，在今天苏联的农村中，自由经营、自由竞争大行其道，简直成了资本主义世界。
    苏修领导集团挖空心思地发展自由市场，不仅大兴土木，甚至为农民上自由市场的交通便利而操心。他们这样做的结果，一些人发财致富，广大人民受剥削；集体农业遭到破坏和瓦解，新的资产阶级分子纷纷出笼。苏联农业经济同实行以利润挂帅为中心的所谓“新体制”的工业经济一样，早已变成了地地道道的资本主义货色。苏修领导集团在复辟资本主义的道路上走得越来越远了。可是他们居然厚着脸皮说什么在“建设共产主义”，真是挂羊头卖狗肉，不知天下还有羞耻事！
    苏修集团复辟资本主义的重要环节
    自由市场在苏联全国大发展
    苏修领导集团实行资本主义复辟的一个重要环节，是在城乡竭力发展资本主义自由市场和自由竞争。最近，苏联《统计通报》刊登的一篇谈论苏联“集体农庄”自由市场的文章，透露了关于这方面的一点情况。
    自由市场遍布各地
    这篇文章透露，苏联自由市场规模巨大，遍布各地。而且除了这种大型自由市场而外，还有许多无法统计的所谓“自发市场”，即不定时地聚有商贩和顾客的地方。
    文章说：“一九六五年每月平均有一千七百万人以上，在集体农庄市场上出卖自己的产品。顾客当然还要多得多。”
    “到一九六六年三月十五日为止，有七千二百六十个农庄市场，其中在城市和城市式的村镇，有五千零五十三个，在各州、边疆区和共和国首府的有九百六十个，在农村地区有二千二百零七个市场。这样，集体农庄商业主要就是城市商业。”
    根据它统计的资料，除集体农庄市场外，国内还有一百四十二个供工业企业出售自己产品的市场，其中有七十个是在州、边疆区和共和国首府。
    大量食品来自自由市场
    这篇文章的统计数字反映出，由于苏修领导集团竭力推行资本主义的自由经营和自由竞争，现在苏联许多城市，居民的食品越来越多地依靠自由市场提供。
    “农庄市场在为居民供应土豆、蔬菜、水果和鸡蛋方面占有特别显著的地位。例如，阿尔马维尔、萨拉托夫、巴拉绍夫、第聂伯罗彼得罗夫斯克、第比利斯、埃里温和敖德萨的居民从农庄市场上买的土豆占他们所买土豆总数的百分之五十五到八十。几乎在所有这些城市里，从农庄市场上买的蔬菜占他们购菜总数的百分之三十到七十。在米丘林斯克、巴拉绍夫、扎波罗热、契尔诺维齐、阿什哈巴德、基什尼奥夫及其他城市，农庄市场出售的鸡蛋，占供给居民鸡蛋量的百分之二十到四十；而敖德萨的居民几乎有一半以上的鸡蛋是从农庄市场上买的。”
    “在许多城市，从市场上买的肉占全部购肉量的百分之二十五到四十。”
    官方投资扶植
    这篇文章宣扬，苏修领导集团通过法令，投入巨额资金，大肆兴建“现代化的设备良好的大型自由市场”，为资本主义经营创造一切方便条件。
    文章说，苏修领导集团取消一九六六年以前实行的把市场收费的相当一部分列入国家预算的做法，为兴建自由市场或更新设备“创造了巨大的可能性。现在，这笔款子可以全部用来经营建设、扩大集体农庄市场和改善市场设备。各加盟共和国部长会议得到权力，可以允许集体农庄市场建立改善市场工作人员文化生活条件的基金。这些资金是十分可观的，准确利用这些资金，能够大大改善集体农庄市场的设施，更广泛地发展集体农庄的商业。”
    鼓励继续发展
    出于全面复辟资本主义的需要，苏修集团实际上在鼓励无限制地发展城市和农村的“私人副业”，鼓励更多的人到自由市场上去做生意。《统计通报》的这篇文章就是为此而制造舆论的。
    文章鼓吹说：“目前，有了进一步发展农庄市场的十分优越的条件。集体农庄越来越普遍和经常地到市场上去推销产品。农庄市场流转额的增长也反映了庄员、工人和职员的私人副业产品的增长。”
    文章叫嚷：“苏共二十三大决议规定要显著改善集体农庄市场的交易，建立各种条件，使集体农庄更广泛地参加到自由市场上去出售农产品。”
    事实胜于雄辩。苏联《统计通报》这篇文章中透露的事实表明：苏修领导集团宣扬的所谓“共产主义建设”，完全是骗人的鬼话；而彻底复辟资本主义才是他们的国策。
