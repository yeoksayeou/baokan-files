After the proletarian revolutionary faction takes power, how can we use Mao Zedong Thought to transform our worldview, thoroughly achieve ideological revolutionization, prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, and ensure that the proletarian dictatorship will never change color? This is a major issue facing us. The preparatory committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee and members of revolutionary mass organizations have seriously studied and understood Chairman Mao's instructions, and in conjunction with the "Several Regulations on Seriously Transforming Work Style" issued by the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee, held a discussion. The following is a summary of the speeches made at the discussion meeting.

Preventing Special Privileges is a Major Political Principle

Teng Haicheng, Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee and Deputy Commander of the Inner Mongolia Military Region: Since the establishment of the preparatory committee for the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region's proletarian cultural revolution, the situation has been getting better and better. Under these circumstances, some comrades in revolutionary mass organizations and revolutionary leaders have begun to develop a sense of self-importance, showing tendencies of seeking fame, seeking profit, seeking power, and seeking position. Some unit leaders are busy with administrative work all day and gradually become estranged from the masses. These tendencies, in essence, are the result of the "self" character. If we do not strengthen ideological revolutionization, various forms of bourgeois ideology will seriously infiltrate our revolutionary ranks, undermine our revolutionary traditions, weaken our combat effectiveness, and may produce new bourgeois representatives. Therefore, preventing the infiltration of bourgeois ideology and preventing special privileges is not a small matter, but a major political principle, a matter of whether the proletarian revolutionary faction, after taking power, will go in the right direction.

Chairman Mao teaches us: "We Communists are not seeking office but revolution. We must all have a thorough revolutionary spirit. We must never for a moment leave the masses. As long as we do not leave the masses, we will certainly be victorious." In the white terror of the bourgeois reactionary line, we fought side by side with the revolutionary masses day and night, sharing the same breath and fate, relying closely on the masses, and the masses enthusiastically supported us. Today, we have been liberated from the oppression of the bourgeois reactionary line. A serious problem confronts us: Are we to be officials and lords, or servants of the people? Are we to be half-hearted revolutionaries or thorough revolutionaries? If, because of changes in position, we forget the masses and forget to carry the revolution to the end, we forget proletarian dictatorship, we betray! Therefore, we must wholeheartedly serve the people and never leave the masses for a moment.

Wu Tao, Deputy Chairman of the Preparatory Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee and Political Commissar of the Inner Mongolia Military Region: To achieve a thorough victory in the proletarian cultural revolution in the Inner Mongolia region, our leading cadre must transform their work style, thoroughly achieve revolutionization, and maintain close ties with the masses, resolutely opposing special privileges.

We must establish a new revolutionary and combat-ready work style, break away from the old rules and customs, and not become a bureaucratic organization. In our work, we must firmly rely on the proletarian revolutionary faction, follow the mass line, and implement Chairman Mao's teaching of "from the masses, to the masses." We must frequently go deep into the actual situation, conduct investigations, and always understand the opinions of the masses, maintaining a close bond with them. Only in this way can the great thought of Mao Zedong and the policies of the Party Central Committee be turned into the actual actions of the masses. To build a revolutionary leading cadre, the most fundamental thing is to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, emphasize proletarian politics, establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought, and strengthen the transformation of our worldview.

The Proletarian Revolutionary Faction Must Withstand New Tests

Gao Jinming, Member of the Preparatory Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee: The regulations of the Shandong Provincial Revolutionary Committee are not only fully applicable to the young revolutionary cadres and leaders of various revolutionary organizations but are also urgently needed by us, the old cadres who have been educated and trained by the Party for many years. Some of our old cadres have made various mistakes in their past work, and some have even made serious mistakes. Under the education of the Party and the criticism and help of the broad revolutionary masses, although some have already corrected or are in the process of correcting their mistakes, they should still diligently follow Chairman Mao's instructions, together with the broad revolutionary masses and young cadres, jointly prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideology; otherwise, they will relapse and be defeated in the face of new severe tests, which may bring new harm to the revolutionary cause.

Quan Xingyuan, Member of the Preparatory Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Revolutionary Committee: Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." In the proletarian cultural revolution, every victory achieved by the proletarian revolutionary faction is due to our great leader Chairman Mao and the broad revolutionary masses. We must never attribute the credit to ourselves. If we do not have this awareness, we will become arrogant and detach ourselves from the masses. Some comrades have put their relationship with the masses in the wrong position. Some leading cadres, after taking power again, have forgotten the lessons of their past mistakes and are willing to listen to flattery but not to criticism. This is very dangerous.

Many facts show that some people have degenerated into capitalist-roaders in power, often starting from allowing bourgeois ideology to infiltrate their lives. If our cadres cannot consciously maintain the spirit of hard struggle and serve the people wholeheartedly as ordinary laborers, but instead pursue enjoyment in life, seek special privileges, there will be the danger of "peaceful evolution."

To ensure that our cadres and the leaders of revolutionary mass organizations can always maintain close ties with the masses, we must mobilize the masses to use weapons such as big debates, big-character posters, big discussions, and big criticisms to supervise and help those in power. Those in power, on the other hand, should strive to actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, humbly accept the criticism and supervision of the masses, and constantly transform their worldview.

All Actions Must Be Guided by Mao Zedong Thought

Tian Shucheng, Member of the "Locomotive" Revolutionary Rebel Headquarters of the Hohhot Railway Bureau: Work style, ideological style, and living style are not minor issues. If we do not handle them well, there will be "peaceful evolution," and the proletarian dictatorship will change color. Our "Locomotive" has been in power in the bureau for a short time, and someone said: "Such a big headquarters, not even a car or a motorcycle, it's really shabby!" Under the influence of this wrong thinking, we got a few small cars and motorcycles. Some comrades went out on business, regardless of distance, had to take a car. The masses saw this and were unhappy, saying: "Isn't this the same as those officials in the past!" The standing committee of the headquarters heard these comments and felt that this was not a small matter, so they organized everyone to study Chairman Mao's works with this issue in mind. Chairman Mao said: "Because of victory, the mood of arrogance, the mood of considering oneself a hero, the mood of stagnation and not seeking progress, the mood of seeking enjoyment and not wanting to live a hard life, may grow." We have taken power and won, so we want to ride in small cars. Isn't this exactly the "mood of seeking enjoyment and not wanting to live a hard life" pointed out by Chairman Mao? Strictly speaking, this is the beginning of "peaceful evolution." If we do not correct it in time, we will go astray. Therefore, our headquarters decided to return all the small cars and motorcycles and proposed to all levels of organizations under the headquarters that in the future, such incidents must be resolutely prevented. In this way, everyone goes out to meetings or on business, either by bicycle or on foot. The members said: "They are the same as us again."

Through this incident, we deeply realized that the key to changing the style is to arm our minds with Mao Zedong Thought. Only by truly mastering Mao Zedong Thought can we resist the infiltration of bourgeois ideology, eliminate bad styles, and maintain the proletarian character.

Sun Jianke, Member of the Red Guard Revolutionary Rebel Command of the Second Wool Textile Factory in Inner Mongolia: We were originally workers and are now in a position of power. Before us are two paths: one is to show off, be extravagant, stand high above, and detach from the masses; the other is to maintain the proletarian character, struggle hard, be willing to be the servants of the people, and wholeheartedly serve the people. In other words, we are also facing the test of the struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines. This test exists every moment and we must not be complacent.

To withstand the test and not change the proletarian character, we must follow Chairman Mao's teaching: "The working class must learn in the course of work, gradually overcome its shortcomings, and never stop." We must always emphasize proletarian politics and achieve ideological revolutionization.

"Forever Be a Yellow Ox for the People, Not a Floating Reed on the Water"

He Guangde, Leader of the Third Red Guard Command in Hohhot, Inner Mongolia: The proletarian revolutionary faction has taken power, but this is only the first step of a long march. The struggle between the two classes, the two roads, and the two lines will continue for a long time. The enemies who have been overthrown are still alive and will use every means to infiltrate our ranks with bourgeois ideology. In the past year and more of the proletarian cultural revolution, our revolutionary youngsters have charged into the battlefield, firmly defended Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, undergone tests and tempering, and made significant progress. However, we must also be soberly aware that our experience in struggle is still limited, we are not politically mature, and there are still many non-proletarian thoughts in our minds. In the situation where the revolution has achieved victory, if we consider ourselves heroes and even pursue enjoyment in life and seek special privileges, we will seriously detach from the masses and be defeated in the face of the sugar-coated bullets of the bourgeoisie.

We must achieve ideological revolutionization and prevent special privileges. The central issue here is to jump out of the quagmire of individualism, overthrow the "self" character, and carry out a thorough revolution to eliminate bourgeois ideology and promote proletarian ideology in our souls. We must actively learn and apply Chairman Mao's works, seriously transform our worldview, temper ourselves in the struggle, and maintain close ties with the working and peasant masses. We must "forever be a yellow ox for the people, not a floating reed on the water." Only in this way can we not become a transient figure in history and become a reliable successor to the proletarian revolutionary cause.

Dong Yuhua, Member of the East Red Fighting Column of the Inner Mongolia Normal University: We proletarian revolutionaries have emerged victorious in the cultural revolution and achieved great victories. In this situation, we should "pursue the fleeing enemy to the end, do not seek fame like King Xiang Yu." However, some people sit on their "glorious struggle history," indulge in the cheers of victory. Some bourgeois representatives with ulterior motives also come to flatter. The wind of extravagance and waste begins to blow. Some people have special lives, detach from the masses, and cannot bear the criticism of their classmates. Some classmates see this situation and are unhappy, saying: "We have overthrown the lords, and now the young masters have come."

Our great leader Chairman Mao says: "The enemy's force cannot conquer us, this has been proven. The flattery of the bourgeoisie may conquer the weak-willed in our ranks." We must firmly remember Chairman Mao's teachings, overcome the vacillation of the petty bourgeoisie, strengthen proletarian revolutionary spirit, and prevent the infiltration of bourgeois ideology.

We must see that the "self" character is the root of restoration planted by the bourgeoisie in our minds, the target of the sugar-coated bullets. We must, while regarding ourselves as a force of the revolution, also regard ourselves as an object of the revolution, establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought in our minds, and advance courageously on the path of ideological revolutionization!

　　树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威　一刻也不脱离群众
　　内蒙古自治区革命委员会筹备小组和革命群众组织成员座谈关于实现思想革命化问题
    无产阶级革命派掌权以后，如何用毛泽东思想改造世界观，彻底实现思想革命化，防止资产阶级思想的侵蚀，使无产阶级政权永不变色？这是摆在我们面前的一个大问题。内蒙古自治区革命委员会筹备小组和革命群众组织成员，认真学习和领会毛主席的教导，联系《山东省革命委员会关于认真转变作风的若干规定》进行了座谈。现将座谈会上的发言摘要发表如下。
      ——编者
    防止特殊化是重大的政治原则问题
    内蒙古自治区革命委员会筹备小组组长、内蒙古军区代司令员滕海青：内蒙古地区的无产阶级文化大革命，自从革命委员会筹备小组成立以来，形势越来越好。在这种情况下，革命群众组织和革命领导干部中有些同志开始滋长了居功自傲的情绪，出现争名、争利、争权、争位的苗头。有些单位的负责人整天忙于事务，与群众的关系逐渐疏远了。这些苗头，归根到底，是“私”字作怪。如果不加强思想革命化，形形色色的资产阶级思想，就会严重地侵入我们革命队伍的肌体，败坏我们的革命传统，损害我们队伍的战斗力，就有可能出现新的资产阶级代表人物。因此，防止资产阶级思想侵蚀，防止特殊化，绝不是小问题，而是重大的政治原则问题，是关系到无产阶级革命派掌权以后向何处去的大问题。
    毛主席教导我们：“我们共产党人不是要做官，而是要革命，我们人人要有彻底的革命精神，我们不要有一时一刻脱离群众。只要我们不脱离群众，我们就一定会胜利。”在资产阶级反动路线的白色恐怖中，我们同革命群众日日夜夜战斗在一起，同呼吸，共命运，紧紧依靠群众，群众热烈拥护我们。今天，我们已经从资产阶级反动路线的压迫下解放出来了。一个严重的问题摆在我们的面前：是做官当老爷，还是做人民的勤务员？是做半截革命派，还是做彻底革命派？如果因为地位变化，而忘记了群众，忘记了把革命进行到底，就是忘记了无产阶级专政，就是背叛！所以，我们必须全心全意地为人民服务，一刻也不脱离群众。
    内蒙古自治区革命委员会筹备小组副组长、内蒙古军区政委吴涛：要在内蒙古地区取得无产阶级文化大革命的彻底胜利，我们的领导班子必须转变作风，彻底实现革命化，密切联系群众，坚决反对特殊化。
    我们一定要树立崭新的革命化、战斗化的作风，要打破过去那一套陈规陋习，不能成为官僚主义的机构。在工作中要坚决依靠无产阶级革命派，走群众路线，实行毛主席“从群众中来，到群众中去”的教导。要经常深入实际，调查研究，随时了解群众的意见，和群众保持血肉般的联系。只有这样，才能使伟大的毛泽东思想和党中央的方针政策变为群众的实际行动。要建立一个革命化的领导班子，最根本的是高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，突出无产阶级政治，树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，加强世界观的改造。
    无产阶级革命派要经得住新的考验
    内蒙古自治区革命委员会筹备小组成员高锦明：山东省革命委员会的规定，不仅对年轻的革命小将、各革命组织的负责人完全适用，而且对于我们这些经过党的多年教育培养的负责干部也完全适用，并且是非常迫切需要的。我们老干部中的一些人，在过去工作中犯过这样那样的错误，有的甚至犯了严重错误。在党的教育和广大革命群众的批判帮助下，虽然有的已经改正或正在改正过来，但是还应该兢兢业业地遵照毛主席的教导，与广大革命群众和青年小将们一道，共同防止资产阶级思想侵蚀，否则就会重蹈覆辙，在新的严峻考验面前打败仗，就可能给革命事业带来新的损害。
    内蒙古自治区革命委员会筹备小组成员权星垣：毛主席教导我们：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”在无产阶级文化大革命中，我们无产阶级革命派取得的每一个胜利，都归功于我们伟大领袖毛主席，归功于广大的革命群众，万万不可把功劳记在自己的名下。如果没有这种自觉，那就会骄傲起来，使自己脱离群众。我们有的同志把自己与群众的关系摆错了位置，有的领导干部在重新掌权以后忘记了自己过去所犯错误的教训，愿听奉承的话，不愿听批评的意见，这是很危险的。
    很多事实证明，有些人所以堕落为走资本主义道路当权派，往往是先从生活上被资产阶级打开缺口的。我们的干部如果不能自觉地继续保持艰苦奋斗的作风，以普通劳动者的姿态去兢兢业业全心全意地为人民服务，而热中于追求生活上的享受，搞特殊化，那就有“和平演变”的危险。
    为了使我们的干部和革命群众组织的负责人能够经常地密切联系群众，必须发动群众运用大鸣、大放、大字报、大辩论等武器，监督和帮助掌权的同志。而掌权的同志自己则应该努力活学活用毛主席著作，虚心接受群众的批评和监督，不断改造自己的世界观。
    一切言行都要以毛泽东思想为准则
    内蒙古呼和浩特铁路局“火车头”革命造反总部田书谦：工作作风、思想作风和生活作风，绝不是小事情。在这方面搞得不好，就会“和平演变”，无产阶级政权就会改变颜色。我们“火车头”在局里掌权不久，有人就说：“这么大的一个总部，连部汽车、摩托也没有，真寒伧！”在这种错误思想影响下，我们就弄来几部小轿车和摩托。有的同志出去办事，不论远近，都要坐车。群众见了不满意地说：“这和过去那些当官的还不是一样！”总部常委听到这种议论，觉得这不是件小事，就组织大家带着这个问题学习毛主席著作。毛主席说：“因为胜利，党内的骄傲情绪，以功臣自居的情绪，停顿起来不求进步的情绪，贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪，可能生长。”我们掌了权，胜利了，就要坐小轿车，难道这不正是毛主席所指出的那种“贪图享乐不愿再过艰苦生活的情绪”吗？严格地说，这是“和平演变”的开始，如果不及时纠正，就会走到邪路上去。因此，我们总部就作出决定，把小轿车、摩托全部退回去，并向总部所属各级组织提出建议，今后坚决杜绝这类事件的发生。这样，大家出去开会、办事，不是骑自行车就是步行。队员们说：“他们和咱们又一样了。”
    通过这件事，我们深深体会到，改变作风的关键在于用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑。只有把毛泽东思想真正学到手，才能抵制资产阶级思想的侵蚀，破除不良作风，保持无产阶级的本色。
    内蒙古第二毛纺织厂红卫兵革命造反司令部孙俭科：我们原来是工人，现在处在当权地位。摆在我们面前的有两条道路：一条是讲排场，摆阔气，高高在上，脱离群众；一条是保持无产阶级的本色，艰苦奋斗，甘当人民的勤务员，全心全意地为人民服务。这也就是说，我们同样面临着两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的考验。这种考验，每时每刻都是存在的，绝不能麻痹大意。
    要想经得住考验，要想不改变无产阶级的本色，就必须遵照毛主席“工人阶级必须在工作中不断学习，逐步克服自己的缺点，永远也不能停止”的教导，念念不忘突出无产阶级政治，实现思想革命化。
    “永做黄牛为人民，不做浮萍水上漂”
    内蒙古自治区呼和浩特红卫兵第三司令部负责人郝广德：无产阶级革命派夺了权，这不过是万里长征的第一步。两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争还会长期存在。被打倒的阶级敌人人还在，心不死，必然要千方百计地用资产阶级思想侵蚀我们的队伍。我们革命小将在过去一年多的无产阶级文化大革命运动中，冲锋陷阵，坚决捍卫了毛主席的无产阶级革命路线，经受了考验和锻炼，取得了不小的进步。但是，也要清醒地看到，我们的斗争经验还不多，政治上还不成熟，头脑里还存在着不少非无产阶级的思想。在革命取得胜利的形势下，如果我们以功臣自居，甚至在生活上追求享受，搞特殊化，那我们就要严重脱离群众，就要在资产阶级的糖衣炮弹面前打败仗。
    我们一定要实现思想革命化，防止特殊化。这里的中心问题，是跳出个人主义泥坑，打倒“私”字，在灵魂深处大搞灭资兴无的革命。我们一定要活学活用毛主席著作，认真改造世界观，在斗争中锻炼自己，密切和工农群众相结合。要“永做黄牛为人民，不做浮萍水上漂”。只有这样，我们才不致成为历史上来去匆匆的过客，才能成为无产阶级革命事业的可靠接班人。
    内蒙古师范学院东方红战斗纵队董玉华：我们无产阶级革命派在文化大革命中杀出来，取得了伟大的胜利。在这种情况下，应该“宜将剩勇追穷寇，不可沽名学霸王。”可是，有些人却坐在“光荣斗争史”上，沉溺在胜利欢呼声中。一些别有用心的资产阶级代表人物，也出来捧场了。讲排场、铺张浪费之风开始刮了起来。有的人生活特殊化，脱离群众，听不得同学的批评。有些同学看到这种情况，不满意地说：“打倒了老爷，又来了少爷。”
    我们伟大的领袖毛主席说：“敌人的武力是不能征服我们的，这点已经得到证明了。资产阶级的捧场则可能征服我们队伍中的意志薄弱者。”我们一定要牢牢记住毛主席的教导，克服小资产阶级的摇摆性，加强无产阶级的革命性，防止资产阶级思想的侵蚀。
    我们要看到，“私”字是资产阶级栽在我们头脑中的复辟的根子，是糖衣炮弹轰击的靶子。我们必须在把自己当作革命的一份力量的同时，又把自己当作革命的对象，在头脑中树立毛泽东思想的绝对权威，在思想革命化的大道上奋勇前进！
