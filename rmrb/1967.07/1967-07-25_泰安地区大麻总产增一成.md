Under the impetus of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the hemp-growing area of Tai'an in Shandong Province, which has 130,000 mu (approximately 8,667 hectares) of hemp, has achieved a bumper harvest. The total production this year has increased by 10% compared to last year. This year, the hemp cultivation area has expanded by more than 10,000 mu compared to last year. Advanced techniques such as early planting, dense planting, and strip sowing have been adopted, and the sowing tasks have been completed on time, with guaranteed quality and quantity.

After the seedlings emerged, they encountered severe drought. The community members, with an unyielding spirit of not fearing fatigue and continuous struggle, dug wells, intercepted underground streams, and fully utilized water pumps and waterwheels to combat the drought.

Currently, all the hemp in the Tai'an region has been harvested. The community members are now, with a revolutionary spirit of "seizing the day," actively peeling the hemp and promptly delivering it to the state.

    泰安地区大麻总产增一成
    据新华社济南电　在无产阶级文化大革命的推动下，山东大麻集中产地——泰安地区种植的十三万多亩大麻，获得丰收，总产比去年增加一成。今年大麻比去年扩种一万多亩，并且采用了早种、密植、条播等先进经验，按时、保质、保量完成了播种任务。幼苗出土后就遇到严重干旱，社员们发扬不怕疲劳和连续作战的作风，掏机井，截潜流，充分利用抽水机、水车等，抗击干旱。
    目前，泰安地区的大麻已全部收完，社员们正以“只争朝夕”的革命精神，积极剥制大麻，及时向国家交售。
