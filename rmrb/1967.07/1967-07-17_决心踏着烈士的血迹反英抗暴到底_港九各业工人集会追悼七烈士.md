More than a thousand representatives of various industries in Hong Kong and Kowloon held a memorial service on the morning of the 15th to mourn the seven martyrs who sacrificed their lives in the struggle against British oppression. The martyrs included Xu Tianbo and others.

The center of the venue was adorned with portraits of the seven martyrs: Xu Tianbo, Li Song, Zeng Ming, Deng Ziqiang, Zhou Songsheng, Luo Jinguo, and Li An. On one side of the portraits hung a couplet from the Waterworks Workers' Committee Against British Oppression: "For the sake of sacrifice, there is great ambition," "Dare to let the sun and moon change the sky." On the other side hung a couplet from the Maritime Workers' Committee Against British Oppression: "Living with integrity," "Dying with honor." The walls around the venue were filled with couplets from various industry committees against British oppression.

The memorial service began with the solemn tune of "The Internationale." All representatives stood in silence. A worker representative then delivered a eulogy, saying, "Our martyrs sacrificed themselves to oppose the aggression and oppression of British imperialism, to defend the dignity of the Chinese nation, to resist the bloody suppression of the British fascists, and for the interests of the people. Their deaths are heavier than Mount Tai. They are truly outstanding sons and daughters of the Chinese nation and good workers of Chairman Mao. We must learn from their fearless revolutionary spirit."

The eulogy called on workers from various industries in Hong Kong and Kowloon to "inherit the will of the martyrs, study Chairman Mao's works more diligently, further arm ourselves with Mao Zedong Thought, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the Hong Kong working class, unite, organize, and take action to launch a comprehensive counterattack against the provocations of British imperialism. If the enemy does not surrender, we will completely and thoroughly annihilate him!"

The representatives, with tears of indignation, denounced the bloody atrocities of the British fascist authorities in killing our patriotic compatriots and praised the fearless spirit of the martyrs who bravely sacrificed themselves to defend the dignity of the Chinese nation. They vowed to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, follow in the footsteps of the martyrs' blood, and resolutely continue the struggle against British oppression to the end.

    决心踏着烈士的血迹反英抗暴到底
    港九各业工人集会追悼七烈士
    据新华社香港十六日电　港九各业工人代表一千多人十五日上午举行追悼会，悼念在反英抗暴斗争中英勇牺牲的徐田波等七位烈士。
    会场正中挂着徐田波、黎松、曾明、邓自强、邹松胜、罗进苟和李安七位烈士的遗像。遗像一边挂着水务工人反对港英迫害斗争委员会的挽联：“为有牺牲多壮志”，“敢教日月换新天”，另一边挂着海事工人反对港英迫害斗争委员会的挽联：“生得磊落”，“死得光荣”。会场四周还挂满了各业工人反对港英迫害斗争委员会送的挽联。
    追悼会在雄壮的《国际歌》乐声中开始。全体代表肃立默哀。接着，一位工人代表在会上致悼词说：“我们的烈士，是为了反对港英帝国主义的侵略和压迫，为了维护中华民族的尊严，反对港英法西斯的血腥镇压，为了人民的利益而牺牲的，他们的死，比泰山还重。他们不愧为中华民族的优秀儿女，毛主席的好工人。我们要学习他们大无畏的革命精神。”
    悼词号召港九各业工人“继承烈士们的遗志，更努力地学习毛主席著作，进一步用毛泽东思想武装自己的头脑，发扬香港工人阶级的革命精神，进一步团结起来，组织起来，行动起来，全面反击英帝国主义的挑衅。如果敌人不投降，就把他彻底、干净、全部地消灭！”
    代表们含着热泪愤怒地控诉港英法西斯当局残杀我爱国同胞的血腥暴行，热烈歌颂烈士们为了维护中华民族的尊严而勇敢牺牲的大无畏精神。他们表示，一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，踏着烈士们的血迹前进，誓把反英抗暴斗争进行到底。
