Press On to New Victories
—Congratulations to the Revolutionary Masses of Wuhan on Their New and Greater Victories

	“In June, the heavenly troops march to conquer the rotten,
	With a ten-thousand-foot cord to bind the rocs.”

Under the loving care of our great leader Chairman Mao and his close comrade Comrade Lin Biao, and with the immense support of the Party Central Committee, the Central Military Commission, the Central Cultural Revolution Group, and the revolutionary masses of the whole country, the revolutionary masses of Wuhan are advancing with an irresistible momentum, crushing the desperate counterattacks of the class enemy. In the great struggle between the two classes, they have won new victories. The warriors of the revolutionary masses are becoming more courageous, stronger, and wiser with each battle. More and more deceived masses are rising up in rebellion. The handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the army, and the bad leaders within the “Million Heroes” whom they control, are becoming more isolated. The great power of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is shaking the three towns of Wuhan. This is a great and joyous situation worth celebrating!

To achieve final victory, the revolutionary masses of Wuhan still face arduous struggles. Comrades of the revolutionary masses must not relax their vigilance or neglect strategic tactics just because the situation has improved.

	“Policy and strategy are the lifeblood of the Party.” To firmly carry out Chairman Mao's instructions and the Party's policies is the fundamental guarantee for the revolutionary masses to achieve victory in their struggles. The more acute and complex the struggle becomes, the more attention must be paid to this point.

An important task facing the revolutionary masses of Wuhan is to win over the deceived masses. The deceived masses are still our class brothers. They have made some mistakes under the deception and manipulation of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the army. We must direct our hatred towards the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the army and the bad leaders within the “Million Heroes” who persist in the bourgeois reactionary line. We must welcome the deceived masses rising up in rebellion. Being deceived is not a crime, but turning against the enemy is a merit. The deceived masses rising up in rebellion is an important condition for the complete isolation, collapse, and destruction of the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the army. We must do thorough and detailed political and ideological work among the deceived masses. By doing good political and ideological work, we can win over the deceived masses, completely isolate the enemy, and make the enemy drown in the vast sea of destruction.

Unity is strength. In the face of the advancing revolutionary victory, the revolutionary masses must pay special attention to strengthening internal unity. The enemy has not yet been completely destroyed; they are still struggling desperately. The revolutionary masses must unite more closely, concentrate their forces, and strike at the enemy.

The broad cadres and fighters of the Wuhan garrison who stand firmly with the revolutionary masses of Wuhan and resolutely support them have done a good job and done it correctly! You are Chairman Mao's good soldiers! You have made new contributions to the people! In the future, always stand shoulder to shoulder with the revolutionary masses of Wuhan, fight together, and win together. You must firmly protect the revolutionary masses of Wuhan, support them politically and ideologically, and together with them, resolutely strike at the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party and the army. Do not rest until complete victory is achieved!

Comrades of the revolutionary masses of Wuhan, comrades of the broad cadres and fighters of the Wuhan garrison, let us, under the guidance of Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, press on to new and greater victories in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution!

    乘胜前进
    ——祝武汉地区无产阶级革命派夺取更大的新胜利
    “六月天兵征腐恶，万丈长缨要把鲲鹏缚。”
    武汉地区的无产阶级革命派，在我们伟大领袖毛主席和他的亲密战友林彪同志的亲切关怀下，在党中央、中央军委、中央文革和全国无产阶级革命派的巨大支持下，正以排山倒海之势，粉碎阶级敌人的疯狂反扑。他们在两个阶级的大搏斗中，取得了新的胜利。无产阶级革命派的战士愈战愈勇，愈战愈强，愈战愈有智慧。受蒙蔽的群众一批又一批地起来造反了。党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和被他们操纵的“百万雄师”中的一小撮坏头头，越来越孤立了。毛主席的无产阶级革命路线的伟大威力，震撼着武汉三镇。这是值得我们热烈欢呼的大好形势！
    武汉地区无产阶级革命派要取得最后的胜利，还要经过艰巨的斗争。无产阶级革命派的同志们，决不能因为形势好转，而松懈斗志，忽视斗争策略。
    “政策和策略是党的生命”。坚决按照毛主席的指示办事，坚决按照党的政策办事，是无产阶级革命派取得斗争胜利的根本保证。斗争越是尖锐，越是复杂，就越要注意这一点。
    摆在武汉地区无产阶级革命派面前的一项重要任务，是争取教育受蒙蔽的群众。受蒙蔽的群众还是我们的阶级弟兄，他们一时做了一些错事，是在一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的欺骗和蒙蔽下干的。我们要把仇恨集中在党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派和“百万雄师”中一小撮坚持资产阶级反动路线的坏头头身上。要欢迎受蒙蔽的群众起来造反。受蒙蔽无罪，反戈一击有功。受蒙蔽的群众起来造反，是党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派彻底孤立、彻底垮台、彻底灭亡的重要条件。我们要对受蒙蔽的群众，进行深入细致的政治思想工作。做好了政治思想工作，把受蒙蔽的群众争取过来，就能彻底孤立敌人，使敌人陷于灭顶之灾的汪洋大海。
    团结就是力量。在革命胜利前进的形势下，无产阶级革命派特别要注意加强内部团结。敌人并没有最后灭亡，他们还在拚死挣扎。无产阶级革命派必须更好地团结起来，集中力量，打击敌人。
    紧紧和武汉地区无产阶级革命派站在一起、坚决支持他们的武汉驻军广大指战员，你们做得好，做得对！你们是毛主席的好战士！你们为人民立下了新功！今后要永远和武汉地区的无产阶级革命派心连心，肩并肩，团结在一起，战斗在一起，胜利在一起。你们要坚决保护武汉地区的无产阶级革命派，从政治上、思想上支持他们，和他们一道，坚决打击党内、军内一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派。不获全胜，决不罢休！
    武汉地区的无产阶级革命派同志们，武汉驻军广大指战员同志们，让我们在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线指引下，乘胜前进，夺取无产阶级文化大革命的更大的新胜利！
                                          （七月二十七日）
