The top capitalist-roader within the Party once again threw out his poisonous weed, "Self-Cultivation," in 1962, vigorously seeking to vindicate and rehabilitate right-opportunist elements. He maliciously slandered the struggle against right-opportunist elements as "imaginary" and "stirring up trouble out of nothing."

Chairman Mao said: "Revisionists and right-opportunists always 'oppose or attempt to weaken the people's democratic dictatorship and the leadership of the Communist Party.' The right-opportunist clique led by Peng Dehuai fiercely attacked the Three Red Banners, opposed the socialist system, and in essence sought to turn the dictatorship of the proletariat into the dictatorship of the bourgeoisie, aiming to restore capitalism in China. They are sworn enemies of the dictatorship of the proletariat. China's Khrushchov and the right-opportunist elements like Peng Dehuai are wolves from the same den. They all dream of capitalism, walk the path of revisionism, and engage in activities to sabotage the dictatorship of the proletariat. In their betrayal of the dictatorship of the proletariat, they are completely alike, and they are all madly challenging the dictatorship of the proletariat!

At the call of the ringleader, all kinds of monsters came out. In 1962, our hometown was hit by a storm of individual farming and rehabilitation, with local landlords and rich peasants becoming extremely arrogant, demanding land and houses from poor and lower-middle peasants, and counterattacking. At that time, I couldn't understand why these bad elements dared to be so lawless. Now I understand that it was because there was such a "big shot" behind them, giving them support and encouragement. This shows that the top capitalist-roader within the Party, by rehabilitating right-opportunist elements, is aiming to restore capitalism.

The proletariat has seized political power from the right-opportunist elements, not allowing them to spread chaos and cause trouble everywhere. The top capitalist-roader within the Party then scolds us as "tyrannical," using "methods of struggle outside the Party to punish comrades." Here, the top capitalist-roader within the Party's extreme hatred for the dictatorship of the proletariat is completely exposed.

We have heard such curses against the dictatorship of the proletariat many times. We want to remind these gentlemen that our relationship with you is one of the proletariat oppressing the bourgeoisie, of the proletariat exercising dictatorship over the bourgeoisie. Frankly, there can be no equality between us. If you call this a "stick," then it is the "golden stick" of the dictatorship of the proletariat. You are both terrified and enraged by this "golden stick." You curse and jump around, all to make us put down this "golden stick" so that you can turn around and seize our political power. We want to warn the top capitalist-roaders within the Party: if you think we will put down the "golden stick" of the dictatorship of the proletariat, you are deluding yourselves! We will firmly grasp this "golden stick" and thoroughly defeat you.

    不许为右倾机会主义分子翻案
    炊事员　孙先仁
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派在一九六二年再次抛出他的大毒草《修养》，极力为右倾机会主义分子鸣冤翻案，把对右倾机会主义分子的斗争，诬蔑为“捕风捉影”、“平地起风波”。
    毛主席说：修正主义者、右倾机会主义者总是“反对或者企图削弱人民民主专政和共产党的领导”。右倾机会主义分子彭德怀一伙，拚命攻击三面红旗，反对社会主义制度，集中到一点，就是妄图变无产阶级专政为资产阶级专政，在中国复辟资本主义。他们是无产阶级专政不共戴天的仇敌。中国的赫鲁晓夫和彭德怀等右倾机会主义分子本来就是一个黑窝里的豺狼，他们做的都是资本主义的梦，走的都是修正主义的路，干的都是破坏无产阶级专政的勾当。他们在背叛无产阶级专政这点上是完全一样的，他们都是疯狂地在向无产阶级专政挑战！
    总头目一声呼唤，牛鬼蛇神纷纷出笼。一九六二年我们家乡刮起了单干风、翻案风，村里地主、富农极为嚣张，向贫下中农要地要房，反攻倒算。当时我想不通，这些坏家伙为什么敢这样无法无天。现在才明白，原来是有这样一个“大人物”在背后给他们撑腰打气。这就说明，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派为右倾机会主义分子翻案，就是要搞资本主义复辟。
    无产阶级专了右倾机会主义分子的政，不准他们到处乱说乱动，兴风作浪，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派就骂我们“横暴”，是用“党外斗争的手段来惩罚同志”。这里，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派极端仇视无产阶级专政的一副凶相，完全赤裸裸地暴露出来了。
    对无产阶级专政的这种咒骂，我们已经听得很多了。我们要提醒这些老爷们，我们同你们的关系是无产阶级压迫资产阶级的关系，是无产阶级对资产阶级实行专政的关系。老实告诉你们，我们和你们之间绝不能是什么平等的关系。要说这是“棍子”，那么这是无产阶级专政的“金棍子”。你们对这根“金棍子”既怕得要死，又恨得要命。你们又是骂又是跳，就是为了想叫我们放下这根“金棍子”，你们好反过来专我们的政。我们要警告党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，你们要想让我们放下无产阶级专政这根“金棍子”，这是痴心妄想！我们一定紧握这根“金棍子”，把你们彻底打倒。
