	No Way Through
	International Relations Institute Red Guards “Five Continents Thunder”

	Chairman Mao teaches us: “Make trouble, fail, make more trouble, fail again, until they are utterly destroyed—this is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people’s cause. They will never deviate from this logic.”

	The Indian reactionaries are following this logic and heading towards their graves.

	The spy Lu Guannan was captured and interrogated by us and then deported. The Indian reactionaries, who are notorious for causing trouble, committed an unprecedented anti-China atrocity in the history of international relations. Not content with that, they are now, under the encouragement of U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, colluding with the reactionary forces in Nepal to engage in anti-China activities in Nepal, attempting to sabotage the friendship between the Chinese people and the Nepalese people.

	What is intolerable is intolerable! This is the Indian reactionaries’ brazen provocation against the great seven hundred million Chinese people!

	The Indian reactionaries’ anti-China sentiments are well known. Their brazen anti-China stance is merely to beg for dollars and rubles, and to divert the attention of the people at home, attempting to ease the increasingly sharp class contradictions. In a word, the Indian reactionaries are trying to find a way out of their internal and external difficulties and their desperate situation by being anti-China.

	Poor old gentlemen, you think you can find a way out by being anti-China! Let me tell you frankly: this way is blocked!

	Today, India is in an unprecedentedly sharp and intense class struggle. The Indian reactionaries, who are on the verge of collapse and breathing their last, are in a desperate situation. Therefore, they want to use anti-China sentiment to incite nationalist emotions, divert the attention of the people at home, and ease class contradictions. This is sheer wishful thinking!

	The Indian reactionaries are not new to anti-China activities; they can be called old hands at it. But what has been the result of their past anti-China actions? Each time they failed more miserably. Now, the Indian reactionaries are losing their minds again. It seems they have completely forgotten the lessons of their past failures. Well, if you insist on being anti-China, you will only suffer even greater setbacks.

	However, facts have educated the Indian people. The Indian people have gradually seen through the political conspiracies of the Indian reactionary government through the various anti-China incidents it has instigated. They have gradually seen through the reactionary nature of the Indian government and gradually realized that the reactionary rule in India is the root of all their sufferings. They have gained new awareness, and the broad masses of the Indian people want to be friendly with the Chinese people. The Indian people are beginning to recognize the mighty power of Mao Zedong Thought and are walking towards the correct path. Armed struggles of the people have emerged in India. In the Darjeeling area, the first thunder of the Indian people’s armed struggle has shaken the land of India. This is the starting point of the Indian people’s victory and the death knell for the Indian reactionaries.

	Recently, to reward the Indian reactionaries for their anti-China efforts, the U.S. imperialist master is giving them a loan of 900 million rupees. The self-absorbed Soviet revisionists have also scrambled together 200,000 tons of grain to “donate” to India and have promised to provide 200 of the latest fighter jets.

	However, no matter how the U.S. imperialists and Soviet revisionists collude to give the Indian reactionaries a lifeline, the Indian reactionaries’ anti-China conspiracies will never succeed. The end of the Indian reactionaries will come soon.

	Chairman Mao said: “No matter how the reactionaries try to stop the forward march of history, revolution will inevitably occur, sooner or later, and will certainly achieve victory.”

	The Indian people have begun to awaken anew. The sparks of revolution will surely ignite a prairie fire, and India will be reborn!

　　此路不通
　　国际关系学院红卫兵“五洲风雷”
    毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”
    印度反动派正在按照这个逻辑走向他们的坟墓。
    间谍分子鲁冠南被我拿获审讯，押解出境。捣乱成性的印度反动派制造了国际关系史上罕见的反华暴行。这还不算，现在，它又在美帝、苏修的鼓励下，勾结尼泊尔的反动势力，在尼泊尔搞反华，妄图破坏中国人民和尼泊尔人民的友谊。
    是可忍，孰不可忍？！这是印度反动派对伟大的七亿中国人民的猖狂挑衅！
    印度反动派反华之心，路人皆知。他们猖狂反华无非是为了乞取美元和卢布，也无非是为了转移国内人民的斗争视线，企图缓和国内日益尖锐的阶级矛盾。说穿了，一句话，印度反动派企图通过反华来摆脱其内外交困、穷途末路的窘境。
    可怜的老爷们，你们想用反华来为自己寻找出路！老实告诉你们：此路不通！
    今日之印度，正处在空前尖锐激烈的阶级矛盾中。日薄西山，气息奄奄，朝不保夕的印度反动派已到了山穷水尽的境地。于是他们想用反华来煽起民族主义情绪，转移国内人民的斗争视线，缓和阶级矛盾，这完全是痴心妄想！
    印度反动派并非是初次反华，它可称之为反华老手了。但是历次的反华结果怎样呢？一次比一次失败得更惨。现在印度反动派又头脑发昏起来了。看来，它已经完全忘记了过去的失败教训，那就好吧，你们再反华，只能再吃一次更大的苦头。
    可是，事实教育了印度人民，印度人民从印度反动政府策动的历次反华事件中逐渐看穿了印度反动派的政治阴谋。他们逐渐看穿了印度政府的反动本质，逐渐懂得了印度的反动统治是他们一切苦难的根源。他们有了新的觉悟，广大的印度人民是要同中国人民友好的。印度人民开始认识到毛泽东思想的强大威力，走向正确的道路。印度出现了人民武装斗争。在大吉岭地区，印度人民武装斗争的第一声春雷震撼了印度的大地。这是印度人民走向胜利的起点，也是印度反动派灭亡的丧钟。
    最近因为奖赏印度反动派反华有功，美帝国主义主子又将给它九亿卢比贷款。自顾不暇的苏修也东拼西凑搞了二十万吨粮食“赠给”印度，还答应准备提供二百架最新式的战斗机。
    但是，不管美帝苏修如何勾结起来给印度反动派输血，印度反动派的反华阴谋决不会得逞。印度反动派末日必将早日来临。
    毛主席说：“不管反动派怎样企图阻止历史车轮的前进，革命或迟或早总会发生，并且将必然取得胜利。”
    印度人民已经开始新的觉醒，革命的星星之火必将燃成燎原的火海，印度必将新生！
