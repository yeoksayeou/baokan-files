	Workers of the North China Metal Structure Factory Correctly Handle Contradictions Among the People
	Strengthen Revolutionary Unity and Observe Revolutionary Discipline
	The Entire Factory Establishes a Good Revolutionary Order and Achieves a Double Harvest in Revolution and Production

	Editor's Note: Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "Among the people, there must be freedom but no anarchism; there must be democracy but no liberalism. This democratic centralism, this unity of freedom and discipline, is what we call democratic centralism." Under this democratic centralism, the enthusiasm of the masses for revolution can be fully brought into play, and they can advance along the path of the proletarian revolution.

	Freedom and discipline are both class-based. Different classes have different freedoms and different disciplines. The revolutionary discipline of the proletariat serves to carry out the proletarian revolutionary line and to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat and the socialist system. For proletarian revolutionary fighters, it is necessary to overthrow the discipline of the bourgeoisie and feudalism, and at the same time, consciously observe and uphold the revolutionary discipline of the proletariat. Whether or not one consciously observes and upholds revolutionary discipline is an important measure of whether one is a genuine proletarian revolutionary.

	The proletarian revolutionary faction of the North China Metal Structure Factory has armed the masses with Mao Zedong Thought, conducted thorough and detailed political and ideological work, educated the broad masses of workers to consciously observe proletarian revolutionary discipline, established a new revolutionary order, and achieved a double harvest in revolution and production. This experience is worth learning from.

	According to a report from our newspaper, the proletarian revolutionary faction and revolutionary workers of the North China Metal Structure Factory in Beijing, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, have seriously studied Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People" and other brilliant works, correctly understood the unity of democracy and centralism, freedom and discipline, and consciously observed proletarian revolutionary discipline, achieving a double harvest in revolution and production.

	After the red rebels took power in this factory, a handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party who had been overthrown were still inciting some uninformed masses to leave their production posts at will, even engaging in armed struggles, and disrupting the new revolutionary order of the proletariat. Some red rebels, influenced by anarchist and ultra-democratic ideas, also exhibited some undisciplined and unorganized behavior. How to strengthen proletarian revolutionary discipline and establish a new revolutionary order thus became the key issue for this factory in seizing the revolution and promoting production.

	Everyone agreed that to rectify proletarian revolutionary discipline and establish a new revolutionary order, the fundamental method is to arm the masses with Mao Zedong Thought and firmly establish the absolute authority of Mao Zedong Thought. They established unified study organizations and systems by production teams and administrative departments, studying Chairman Mao's "On the Correct Handling of Contradictions Among the People," "On Rectifying the Party's Erroneous Ideas," "Opposing Liberalism," and other brilliant works, as well as the important documents "Letter from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China to Revolutionary Workers and Revolutionary Cadres in All Factories, Mines, and Enterprises Across the Country" and the May 16, 1966, "Notification" from the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.

	During the study, everyone linked theory with practice, exposed their thoughts, presented facts, and reasoned logically, using Chairman Mao's words as a mirror to examine themselves and engage in self-criticism. They said, Chairman Mao's words are all truths. Listening to Chairman Mao's words is the highest discipline for proletarian revolutionaries. Chairman Mao's words, we must resolutely execute and follow to the letter. Some red rebels voluntarily examined themselves, admitting that they had previously blurred the boundaries between the two types of contradictions and had not warmly and patiently helped those who had been deceived, but instead used coercive methods. Many deceived workers also examined themselves: because they had not listened to Chairman Mao's words, they had fallen for the tricks of the class enemy, focusing only on minor issues of the revolutionary faction and mistaking the tributary for the mainstream, thus going astray. One worker emotionally said, "We are all from the same vine, it was the capitalist reactionary line that divided us. We must unite and seize the revolution and promote production, launching a fierce attack on the class enemy."

	Through the study, the workers eliminated their differences, strengthened their unity, and quickly established a good order for socialist production and the Cultural Revolution throughout the factory, conducting production efficiently and economically. Over the past few months, they have completed their production tasks in excess every month.

	The revolutionary workers of this factory linked the study with practice, studying Chairman Mao's saying: "Among the people, there must be freedom but no anarchism; there must be democracy but no liberalism. This democratic centralism, this unity of freedom and discipline, is what we call democratic centralism. Under this system, the people enjoy extensive democracy and freedom; at the same time, they must discipline themselves with socialist discipline."

	In the discussion, everyone criticized the anarchist tendency among a few people who wanted democracy but not centralism, wanted freedom but not discipline, and did whatever they pleased. Some people thought that since daring to think, dare to do, and dare to make revolution was advocated, they could be unrestrained by any discipline. A young worker, because of this wrong understanding, had once left his production post without authorization and gone to another place to make connections. The revolutionary organization immediately seized this incident, conducting propaganda and discussion among the masses, and organizing old workers to recall past sufferings and think of sweet times, conducting class education for young workers. Through the discussion, the workers realized: democracy and freedom are class-based. Our democracy and freedom serve to consolidate the dictatorship of the proletariat. In the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, smashing the discipline and order of the bourgeoisie and revisionism is to firmly establish the conscious discipline and revolutionary order of the proletariat. Anarchism is not about not wanting any government; it is about wanting a bourgeois government. In a class society, all issues must be analyzed from a class perspective. If class analysis is not conducted, and the revolutionary discipline and order of the proletariat are also overturned as "frames," that is completely wrong.

	The proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory also mobilized the masses to resolutely fight against all phenomena that disrupt revolutionary and production order. Not long ago, a worker left his post without authorization to participate in the smashing and looting of another unit. They immediately used this example as a negative teaching material, conducting a discussion among the workers to oppose anarchism, educating everyone to truly recognize the harmful nature of the anarchist reactionary trend from a ideological perspective and consciously observe the various administrative orders issued by the revolutionary leadership.

　　华北金属结构厂职工正确处理人民内部矛盾
　　增强革命团结　遵守革命纪律
　　全厂建立起良好的革命秩序，获得革命、生产双丰收
    编者按：我们伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“在人民内部，不可以没有自由，也不可以没有纪律；不可以没有民主，也不可以没有集中。这种民主和集中的统一，自由和纪律的统一，就是我们的民主集中制。”在这种民主集中制下面，群众的革命积极性才能充分发挥出来，沿着无产阶级革命的轨道前进。
    自由和纪律都是有阶级性的。不同的阶级有不同的自由，不同的纪律。无产阶级革命纪律，是为贯彻执行无产阶级革命路线服务的，是为巩固无产阶级专政和社会主义制度服务的。对于无产阶级革命战士说来，必须打倒资产阶级的、封建主义的纪律，同时必须自觉地遵守和维护无产阶级的革命纪律。是不是自觉地遵守和维护革命的纪律，是衡量是不是真正的无产阶级革命派的一个重要标志。
    华北金属结构厂的无产阶级革命派，用毛泽东思想武装群众，通过深入细致的政治思想工作，教育广大职工自觉地遵守无产阶级革命纪律，建立了革命新秩序，取得了革命、生产双丰收。这一经验，是值得学习的。
    本报讯　北京华北金属结构厂的无产阶级革命派和革命职工，在解放军帮助下，认真学习了毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》等光辉著作，正确认识民主和集中的统一，自由和纪律的统一，自觉地遵守无产阶级革命纪律，获得了革命和生产的双丰收。
    这个厂的红色造反者掌权以后，被打倒的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派，还在挑动一些不明真相的群众擅自离开生产岗位，甚至进行武斗，破坏无产阶级革命的新秩序。少数红色造反者因受无政府主义、极端民主化的思想影响，也发生了一些无组织无纪律的行为。如何加强无产阶级革命的纪律，建立新的革命秩序，就成了这个厂抓革命、促生产的关键问题。
    大家认为，要整顿无产阶级革命纪律，建立新的革命秩序，最根本的办法，就是用毛泽东思想武装群众，大树毛泽东思想的绝对权威。他们以生产班组、行政科室为单位，建立了统一的学习组织和制度，学习了毛主席的《关于正确处理人民内部矛盾的问题》、《关于纠正党内的错误思想》、《反对自由主义》等光辉著作，学习了《中共中央给全国厂矿企业革命职工、革命干部的信》和中共中央一九六六年五月十六日《通知》等重要文件。
    在学习中，大家联系实际，亮思想，摆事实，讲道理，把毛主席的话当作镜子，对照检查自己，多作自我批评。他们说，毛主席的话，句句是真理。听毛主席的话，是无产阶级革命者的最高纪律。毛主席的话，我们要坚决执行，句句照办。有的红色造反者主动检查自己过去曾混淆了两类矛盾的界限，对受蒙蔽的阶级兄弟，不是热情地耐心地帮助他们，而是采用压服的方法。许多受蒙蔽的工人也纷纷检查自己：因为没有听毛主席的话，上了阶级敌人的当，只抓革命派的某些枝节问题，把支流当主流，以致走错了路。有的工人激动地说：“我们都是一根藤上的瓜，是资产阶级反动路线使我们分了家，我们一定要团结起来，抓革命、促生产，向阶级敌人猛烈开火。”
    通过学习，职工群众消除了隔阂，增强了团结，全厂很快建立起社会主义生产和文化大革命的良好秩序，多快好省地进行生产。几个月来，月月超额完成生产任务。
    这个厂的革命职工联系实际，学习了毛主席这段语录：“在人民内部，不可以没有自由，也不可以没有纪律；不可以没有民主，也不可以没有集中。这种民主和集中的统一，自由和纪律的统一，就是我们的民主集中制。在这个制度下，人民享受着广泛的民主和自由；同时又必须用社会主义的纪律约束自己。”
    在讨论时，大家批评了少数人中存在的只要民主、不要集中，只要自由、不要纪律，爱怎么干就怎么干的无政府主义倾向。有人认为，既然提倡敢想、敢干、敢革命，就可以不受任何纪律的约束。有个青年工人就因为有这种错误认识，曾经擅自离开生产岗位，跑到外地去串连。革命组织立刻抓住这件事，在群众中展开宣传和讨论，并组织老工人忆苦思甜，对青年工人进行阶级教育。通过讨论，职工们认识到：民主、自由是有阶级性的，我们的民主、自由，是为巩固无产阶级专政服务的。在无产阶级文化大革命中，大破资产阶级的、修正主义的纪律和秩序，就是要大立无产阶级自觉的纪律和革命的秩序。无政府主义并不是真的不要政府，而是要的资产阶级政府。在阶级社会中生活，对一切问题都要作阶级分析，如果不作阶级分析，把无产阶级的革命纪律和秩序都当成“框框”反掉，那是十分错误的。
    这个工厂的无产阶级革命派，还发动群众坚决同一切扰乱革命和生产秩序的现象作斗争。不久前，一个工人擅离岗位，参加对另一个单位的打砸行为。他们立即以这个例子作反面教材，在职工群众中展开反对无政府主义的讨论，教育大家从思想上真正认识无政府主义反动思潮的危害性，自觉地遵守革命领导机关发布的各种行政命令。
