Vice Premier Li Xiannian held a banquet tonight to warmly welcome Vice Premier Le Quoc Vy of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and the members of the Vietnamese government's economic delegation led by him.

At the banquet, filled with revolutionary friendship, Vice Premier Li Xiannian and Vice Premier Le Quoc Vy both spoke. Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that the great victories achieved by the heroic Vietnamese people in the war of resistance against American aggression are brilliant victories of people's war and miracles in the history of world people's revolutionary wars. The Chinese people, tempered by the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and armed with Mao Zedong Thought, are determined to fully support the Vietnamese people in carrying the war of resistance against American aggression to the end and achieving final victory.

Vice Premier Le Quoc Vy said that the entire Party, people, and army of Vietnam are resolute in fighting the U.S. imperialists to the end, no matter how long it takes and no matter how great the sacrifices, they will definitely achieve the cause of defending the North, liberating the South, and reunifying the country.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian spoke first at the banquet. He warmly praised and congratulated the heroic Vietnamese people for their series of new great victories under the correct leadership of Chairman Ho Chi Minh in the war of resistance against American aggression. He said that the great victories of the Vietnamese people have greatly dampened the arrogance of U.S. imperialism, modern revisionism, and reactionaries of all countries, greatly boosted the morale of revolutionary people all over the world, and set a brilliant example for the peoples of Asia, Africa, and Latin America in their struggle for national liberation. This is the pride of the Vietnamese people and also the pride of all the peoples of the world!

Vice Premier Li Xiannian strongly condemned the Soviet modern revisionist leadership clique for intensifying their collusion with U.S. imperialism in an attempt to extinguish the revolutionary flames of the Vietnamese people. He pointed out that no matter what tricks and schemes U.S. imperialism and Soviet modern revisionism play, they will never be able to disrupt the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression, but will only hasten their own doom. The final victory will definitely belong to the Vietnamese people who are determined to fight to the end.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian said that Chairman Mao teaches us: "The people who have already won revolutionary victories should support the struggle of the people who are still striving for liberation. This is our internationalist duty." Our government and people have always followed the teachings of our great leader Chairman Mao, firmly supporting the Vietnamese people's war of resistance against American aggression.

Vice Premier Li Xiannian spoke about the victory of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution personally initiated and led by Chairman Mao. He said that at present, the broad masses of the people in our country are high-spiritedly carrying out a new high tide of revolutionary criticism, holding high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticizing and exposing the counter-revolutionary revisionist Khrushchev's counter-revolutionary revisionist line, thoroughly criticizing and exposing the bourgeois reactionary line, and thoroughly establishing Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, making the socialist iron mountains and rivers of our country unchangeable. The victory of our Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has brought about earth-shaking changes in our country's political life and socialist construction.

Vice Premier Le Quoc Vy spoke about the great victories achieved by the Vietnamese people in their war of resistance against American aggression. He said that the great victories achieved by the military and people of the South and North are victories under the leadership of the Vietnam Workers' Party, victories of the people's war line, and victories of the iron will and determination to fight to the end and defeat the U.S. aggressors.

Vice Premier Le Quoc Vy strongly condemned U.S. imperialism for intensifying its troop buildup and expanding its aggression against Vietnam, and for carrying out new military adventures in North Vietnam. He said that the world's number one enemy, the most reactionary and brutal force of our time, U.S. imperialism, after suffering heavy defeats in Vietnam, is now trying to extricate itself from its passive situation and reverse the situation. However, as Chairman Mao has pointed out, no matter how desperately U.S. imperialism struggles, it cannot reverse the inevitable laws of history. They cannot reverse their heavy defeats.

Vice Premier Le Quoc Vy said that in order to realize Chairman Ho Chi Minh's historic call on July 17, 1966, the Vietnamese people are determined to overcome all difficulties, firmly achieve their national liberation and socialist revolution, and firmly fulfill their internationalist duties.

Vice Premier Le Quoc Vy said that on behalf of the Vietnam Workers' Party, the Vietnamese government, and the Vietnamese people, he expresses deep gratitude to the Chinese Communist Party, the Chinese government, and the Chinese people, who, under the leadership of the beloved Chairman Mao, have always regarded our revolutionary cause as their own, stood shoulder to shoulder with the Vietnamese people, and spared no effort to help the Vietnamese people defeat the U.S. aggressors.

Vice Premier Le Quoc Vy said that the Vietnamese people are delighted by the victories achieved by the Chinese people in socialist construction. The Vietnamese people sincerely wish the great Chinese people, under the leadership of the glorious Chinese Communist Party headed by the most beloved leader Chairman Mao Zedong, even greater achievements in socialist construction and success in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

Those who were invited to the banquet included Deputy Head of the Permanent Delegation of the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam to China Ly Son San and officials from the Vietnamese Democratic Republic's embassy in China.

Attending the banquet were also relevant officials such as Fang Yi, Peng Shaohui, Han Nianlong, Li Qiang, Zhang Xianyue, Ding Xilin, Yang Lin, and Nie Yuanzi.

    新华社二十一日讯　国务院副总理李先念今晚举行宴会，热烈欢迎越南民主共和国副总理黎清毅和由他率领的越南政府经济代表团的同志。
    在充满革命友情的宴会上，李先念副总理和黎清毅副总理先后讲了话。李先念副总理说，英雄的越南人民在抗美救国战争中所取得的伟大胜利，是人民战争的光辉胜利，是世界人民革命战争史上的奇迹。经过无产阶级文化大革命的锻炼和用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，决心全力支援越南人民将抗美救国战争进行到底，直到取得最后胜利。
    黎清毅副总理说，越南全党、全民和全军坚决和美帝国主义战斗到底，不论要战斗多久，不论要做怎样的艰苦牺牲，也一定要实现保卫北方、解放南方、统一祖国的事业。
    李先念副总理首先在宴会上讲话。他热烈赞扬和祝贺英雄的越南人民在胡志明主席的正确领导下，在抗美救国战争中取得的一系列新的伟大胜利。他说，越南人民的伟大胜利，大灭了美帝国主义、现代修正主义和各国反动派的威风，大长了全世界革命人民的志气，为亚非拉各国人民争取民族解放的斗争树立了光辉榜样。这是越南人民的骄傲，也是全世界人民的骄傲！
    李先念副总理强烈谴责苏联现代修正主义领导集团加紧同美帝国主义勾结，力图扑灭越南人民的革命烈火。他指出，不管美帝国主义和苏联现代修正主义玩弄什么阴谋诡计，都绝对不能破坏越南人民的抗美救国战争，而只会加速他们的灭亡。最后胜利一定属于决战决胜的越南人民。
    李先念副总理说，毛主席教导我们说：“已经获得革命胜利的人民，应该援助正在争取解放的人民的斗争，这是我们的国际主义的义务。”我国政府和人民一贯遵照我们伟大的领袖毛主席的教导，坚决支援越南人民的抗美救国战争。
    李先念副总理谈到由毛主席亲自发动和领导的中国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利时说，目前，我国广大人民群众正在高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，掀起了革命大批判的新高潮，把中国的赫鲁晓夫彻底批倒批臭，大破资产阶级反动路线，大立毛主席无产阶级革命路线，让社会主义铁打的江山永不变色。我国无产阶级文化大革命的胜利，使我国政治生活和社会主义建设事业发生了天翻地覆的变化。
    黎清毅副总理在讲话中谈到越南人民在抗美救国斗争中所取得的巨大胜利。他说，越南南北方军民所取得的一个又一个的巨大的胜利，是在越南劳动党领导下所取得的胜利，是人民战争路线的胜利，是钢铁般的决心和决战决胜美帝国主义侵略者的胜利。
    黎清毅副总理强烈谴责美帝国主义加紧增兵，扩大对越南的侵略战争，在越南北方进行新的军事冒险。他说，世界人民的头号敌人、当代最反动最残暴的势力美帝国主义，在越南遭到惨重的失败后，正力图摆脱其被动的困境，妄图扭转局面。但是，正如毛主席论断的那样，不管美帝国主义怎样作垂死的挣扎，也决不能扭转历史的必然规律。他们决不能挽回他们惨重的败局。
    黎清毅副总理说，为了实现胡志明主席一九六六年七月十七日富有历史意义的号召，越南人民坚决排除万难，坚决胜利完成自己的民族解放和社会主义革命事业，坚决完成自己的国际主义义务。
    黎清毅副总理说，我代表越南劳动党、越南政府和越南人民向始终把我们的革命事业看作是自己的事业，坚决和越南人民并肩在一起，竭尽全力帮助越南人民战胜美国侵略者的以敬爱的毛主席为首的中国共产党、中国政府和中国人民表示深深的感谢。
    黎清毅副总理说，越南人民为中国人民在社会主义建设中取得的胜利感到欢欣鼓舞。越南人民衷心地祝伟大的中国人民在以中国人民最最敬爱的领袖毛泽东主席为首的光荣的中国共产党的领导下，在社会主义建设事业中取得更辉煌的成就，无产阶级文化大革命取得成功。
