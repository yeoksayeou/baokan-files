    Japanese Workers and Farmers Oppose U.S. Expansion of Base
    Over 30,000 workers and students from Tokyo, Kanagawa, Tochigi, Saitama, and other areas, along with local farmers in Sunagawa City, held a rally on the afternoon of the 9th to oppose the U.S. expansion of the military base in Tachikawa.

    Greenwood Shichiro, a representative of Sunagawa City's farmers, said at the meeting: "We will not yield to the brutal suppression by the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries. With an iron will, we are determined to carry on the struggle against the U.S. expansion of military bases and demand the withdrawal of U.S. military bases from Japan to the end."

    Zimbabwe Guerrillas Ambush Colonial Military Convoy
    The Zimbabwe African National Union guerrillas recently ambushed a colonial military convoy from Southern Rhodesia on the Sinoia-Salisbury road, killing nine white colonial soldiers and injuring many others.

    100,000 Agricultural Workers in Southern Italy Strike
    In the Apulia region of southern Italy, 100,000 agricultural workers went on strike to resist the brutal exploitation by capitalists and landlords, demanding the revision of contracts and lease agreements, and improvements in social insurance. The strike lasted for ten days.

    According to Italian officials, in the entire Apulia region with a population of 3.5 million, there are 400,000 unemployed; 500,000 able-bodied men and women are forced to scatter and seek livelihoods elsewhere.

    70,000 Metal Workers in Argentina Strike
    On the 12th, 70,000 metal workers in Buenos Aires, the capital of Argentina, went on a 24-hour strike to protest against the pro-American dictatorial regime of Onganía, which implements reactionary economic policies that sell out national interests and lay off a large number of workers.

    Previously, some enterprises in the metallurgical sector, citing financial difficulties, laid off over 3,500 workers. The Argentine government, under the pretext of "rationalizing administrative agencies" and reducing the national budget deficit, announced that it would lay off 80,000 to 100,000 employees.

    U.S. and West Germany Provide Loans to Indonesian Reactionaries
    The U.S. imperialists recently announced that, through the Agency for International Development, they will provide another $5 million in loans to the fascist military regime in Indonesia, which is in a state of internal and external turmoil, to further align it with the U.S., and to be anti-China, anti-communist, and anti-people.

    According to a statement from the West German Foreign Ministry on the 7th, the West German government, following the U.S. imperialists, will also provide 50 million West German Marks in loans to the Indonesian military regime. This decision was made after the West German authorities held talks with an economic delegation sent by the Indonesian fascist military regime in early July to provide "economic aid."
