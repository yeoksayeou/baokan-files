The recent wave of anti-China and anti-Chinese sentiment whipped up by the Ne Win reactionary government in Burma is an attempt to divert the strong discontent of the broad masses of people at home through these despicable means, to beg for "aid" from U.S. imperialism and Soviet revisionism, and to strengthen its anti-communist, anti-people, and counter-revolutionary rule. Even bourgeois newspapers in Japan and the West cannot conceal the political and economic background of the Ne Win reactionary government's frenzied anti-China campaign:

The Domestic Reactionary Rule Has Completely Collapsed

It must be noted that the background to the anti-China riots that have been occurring continuously in Burma since July 22 is the failure of the economic nationalization policy of Ne Win's government's "Burmese-style socialism," the shortage of food, the active anti-government guerrilla warfare, and the abrupt changes in the domestic situation of Burma caused by the chain reaction of these factors over the past few months.

The military regime of Ne Win began to implement full economic nationalization in February 1963, and the result has been a complete failure.

The current situation with rice in Burma has become so urgent that there is a danger that the people will have no rice to eat by October this year.

The production of rice in the 1965-66 fiscal year was approximately 790 million tons, of which 110 million tons were exported. However, production in the 1966-67 fiscal year decreased significantly compared to the previous year, reaching only 650 million tons. The export of rice, which was approximately 300 million tons before the Second World War and 200 million tons ten years ago, is estimated to be only 47 million tons this year, and the rate of decrease is indeed too fast.

To Beg for Western "Aid"

The timing of the Rangoon incident leaves no doubt that its cause was not entirely spontaneous. ... It is very likely that General Ne Win initially felt that stirring up some anti-foreign sentiment would weaken domestic political discontent, make the people support the government's movement to suppress communist activities in rural areas, and create conditions for Rangoon to obtain more generous aid from the West.

The latest blow to the government over the past year has been the severe shortage of rice. In 1966, the state sold 983,000 tons of rice for domestic consumption, with exports slightly lower. In 1967, the state purchased only 710,000 tons of rice for domestic consumption, of which more than half has already been sold, leaving only 310,000 tons before the new harvest at the end of the year.

Ne Win now urgently needs a large amount of foreign aid, but his past neutral stance prevented him from receiving such a large amount of aid. More significantly, during the Chinese Cultural Revolution, he visited some countries that are hostile to Beijing— the United Kingdom, the United States, Thailand, and Japan.

### 奈温政府疯狂反华的背景

专栏：外论摘要

    奈温政府疯狂反华的背景
    缅甸奈温反动政府最近掀起反华排华的狂潮，妄想用这种卑劣的手段来转移国内广大人民的强烈不满，乞求美帝苏修的“援助”，以便加强它的反共反人民反革命的统治。对于奈温反动政府疯狂反华的这种政治的和经济的背景，连日本和西方的资产阶级报纸，也无法掩饰：
    国内反动统治完全破产
    不能不看到，上月二十二日以来在缅甸国内接连不断发生的反华暴动的背景在于：由奈温政府的“缅甸式社会主义”造成的经济国有化政策的失败、粮食缺乏、反政府游击战活跃等等，这几个月的连锁反应所产生的缅甸国内形势的急骤变化。
    奈温军事政权一九六三年二月着手实现争取经济全面国有化的结果，已经完全失败了。
    最近缅甸粮食的情况，已经紧迫到今年十月国民就没有米吃的危险程度。
    大米的生产量，一九六五——六六年度约为七百九十万吨，其中出口了一百一十万吨。可是，一九六六——六七年度的生产比上一年度大幅度减产，只达到六百五十万吨。大米的出口，第二次世界大战以前是大约三百万吨，十年前是二百万吨，可是，今年估算只有四十七万吨，减少的速度实在是太快了。

    为了乞求西方“援助”
    仰光事件发生的时机使人毫不怀疑，它的起因并不是完全自发的。……很可能，奈温将军起初觉得，搞一点仇外情绪会使国内的政治上的不满情绪减弱，使人民支持政府镇压农村地区的共产党活动的运动，并且为仰光得到西方的更加慷慨的援助准备好条件。
    过去一年里，对政府的最新的一个打击就是大米严重不足。一九六六年，国家销售了九十八万三千吨大米供国内消费之用，出口量则稍低一些。而在一九六七年，国家仅仅采购了七十一万吨大米供国内消费，其中一半以上已经售出，在年底新的作物收获以前就只剩下三十一万吨了。
    奈温现在极需大量的外援，而过去他的中立态度使他不能接受这么大量的外援。更加意味深长的是，在中国文化革命期间，他访问了与北京为敌的一些国家——联合王国、美国、泰国和日本。
