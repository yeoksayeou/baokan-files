Title: On "Mutual Learning"

Edition: 4

The top capitalist-roader in the Party openly advocates that Communist Party members "must seriously learn from them (the bourgeoisie)," and the author of the reactionary film "The Enemy at the Gate" follows his master's lead, advocating that the People's Liberation Army should learn from the reactionary army of the Kuomintang. This is not a mere coincidence but a necessary result of the master's instructions and the servant's diligence.

Chairman Mao says: "All dark forces that harm the people must be exposed, and all revolutionary struggles of the people must be praised. This is the fundamental task of revolutionary artists." The author of the reactionary film "The Enemy at the Gate" not only fails to expose the dark forces that harm the people but also advocates learning from these dark forces. At the end of the film, our tall soldier says to the short soldier of the just-surrendered 369th Division of the Kuomintang: "Mutual learning, huh!" Although it is just a brief sentence, the intention behind it is extremely sinister. Chairman Mao says: "Our Communist Party and the Eighth Route Army and New Fourth Army led by the Communist Party are revolutionary forces. Our army is completely dedicated to liberating the people and working wholeheartedly for the people's interests." The Kuomintang army, on the other hand, is the army of the big landlords and big bourgeoisie, completely serving the traitor Chiang Kai-shek. How can two armies of such different natures "mutually learn" from each other? Perhaps the author will say: "I am only talking about mutual learning between the tall soldier and the short soldier." In fact, this is not worth refuting. The tall soldier, after being captured by us, has undergone patient education and has become a revolutionary soldier with a certain degree of proletarian consciousness. The short soldier, however, is a diehard who sells himself to the Kuomintang reactionaries, has been captured three times and returned to the Kuomintang army three times, and even dreams of becoming an official, never forgetting the "favor" of Commander Zheng. What can our revolutionary soldiers learn from him? Learn from his "experience" of escaping three times? Learn from how he never forgets the "favor" of the exploiting class? Absolutely not! Perhaps the author will say: The tall soldier's expression of wanting to "mutually learn" with the short soldier shows the humility of our people's army. In fact, this is not the case. We are the children of the people, and in front of the people, we "bow our heads to be the ox of the children." Towards the people, we must be humble. But in front of the enemy, we must not be humble at all, we must not be polite at all. We can only use our heroic spirit to overwhelm it. If we are humble to the enemy, that is a crime against the people, and we do not deserve to be called the children of the people.

What is worth pondering is that the director of "The Enemy at the Gate" so brazenly advocates that the people's army should learn from the reactionary army of the Kuomintang, which is not an isolated incident but has the backing of his boss. This boss is China's Khrushchev. As early as the initial period of the War of Resistance Against Japan, he wanted us to learn from Confucius and Mencius, attempting to make Communists withdraw from fierce class struggle to pursue personal fame and fortune in seclusion; in the early period of the War of Liberation, he again wanted us to learn from the Kuomintang, to learn how to be officials and give speeches, in order to seek personal "lifetime wealth and honor"; after national victory, he advocated learning from the bourgeoisie and revisionism, and until 1960, when the Soviet Union was increasingly moving towards the restoration of capitalism, he still vigorously advocated that "the Soviet Union's today is our tomorrow." It is not difficult to see that the author of "The Enemy at the Gate" advocates learning from the reactionary army, with the purpose of serving the capitalist-road line of the top capitalist-roader in the Party, attempting to make us forget class struggle and forget the dictatorship over the enemy through "mutual learning," and to transform socialist China into a capitalist China. This is something we absolutely cannot allow. We must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary fallacies of the handful of top capitalist-roaders in the Party, and resolutely carry the Cultural Revolution of the proletariat through to the end!

    从“互相学习”谈起
    解放军塔山英雄团副政委　鲍德福
    党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派公开鼓吹共产党员“必须认真地向他们（资产阶级）学习”，反动电影《兵临城下》的作者就紧跟在他主子的后面，鼓吹人民解放军应当向国民党反动派的军队学习。这绝不是偶然的巧合，而是主子授意、奴才卖力的必然结果。
    毛主席说：“一切危害人民群众的黑暗势力必须暴露之，一切人民群众的革命斗争必须歌颂之，这就是革命文艺家的基本任务。”反动影片《兵临城下》的作者不仅没有暴露危害人民群众的黑暗势力，反而鼓吹我们向黑暗势力学习。在影片的结尾，我军的大个子兵对刚刚起义的国民党三六九师的小个子兵说：“互相学习么！”虽然只是简短的一句话，但用心却是极其险恶的。毛主席说：“我们的共产党和共产党所领导的八路军、新四军，是革命的队伍。我们这个队伍完全是为着解放人民的，是彻底地为人民的利益工作的。”而国民党军队是大地主、大资产阶级的队伍，是完全为卖国贼蒋介石服务的。这样性质完全不同的两种军队，怎么能“互相学习”呢？也许作者会说：“我只是讲大个子兵和小个子兵之间的互相学习。”其实这也值不得一驳。大个子兵被我俘虏后，经过耐心教育，已经成了一个有一定无产阶级觉悟的革命战士，而小个子兵则是一个死心塌地为国民党反动派卖命、三次被俘又三次自愿跑回国民党军队，连做梦“也在想当官”、一心不忘郑团长的“恩德”的奴才，叫我们革命战士向他学习什么？学习他三次逃跑的“经验”吗？学习他如何念念不忘剥削阶级的“恩德”吗？绝对不能！也许作者会说：大个子兵表示要和小个子兵“互相学习”，这是表明我们人民军队的谦虚。其实非也。我们是人民的子弟兵，在人民群众面前，我们“俯首甘为孺子牛”，对待群众，我们一定要谦虚。但在敌人面前，我们丝毫也不能谦虚，丝毫不能客气，我们只能用英雄的气概去压倒它。如果对敌人谦虚，那就是对人民的犯罪，就根本不配称人民的子弟兵。
    值得我们深思的是，《兵临城下》的编导者这样明目张胆地鼓吹人民军队要向国民党反动军队学习，不是孤立的，是有他的后台老板撑腰的。这个后台老板就是中国的赫鲁晓夫。远在抗日战争初期，他就要我们向孔、孟学习，妄图使共产党人离开激烈的阶级斗争，去为个人的名利闭门“修养”；解放战争初期，他又要我们向国民党学习，学会做官、讲演，以求个人的“一生富贵”；全国胜利后，他又鼓吹向资产阶级学习，向修正主义学习，直到一九六○年，苏联在复辟资本主义的道路上越走越远的时候，他还拚命鼓吹“苏联的今天，就是我们的明天”。这就不难看出，《兵临城下》的作者鼓吹我们向反动军队学习，其目的就是为党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派所推行的投降主义路线服务，妄图通过和敌人“互相学习”，使我们忘记阶级斗争，忘记对敌人的专政，使社会主义的中国演变成资本主义的中国。这是我们绝对不能允许的。我们一定要更高地举起毛泽东思想伟大红旗，彻底批判党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的反革命谬论，坚决把无产阶级文化大革命进行到底！
