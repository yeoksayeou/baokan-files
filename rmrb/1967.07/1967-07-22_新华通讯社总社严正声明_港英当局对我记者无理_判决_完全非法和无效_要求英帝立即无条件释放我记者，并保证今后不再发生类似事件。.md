	Xinhua News Agency Headquarters Issues Solemn Declaration
	Hong Kong British Authorities' Unreasonable "Sentencing" of Our Journalist is Completely Illegal and Invalid
	Demands British Imperialists Immediately Unconditionally Release Our Journalist and Ensure No Similar Incidents Occur in the Future

	Xinhua News Agency, July 20th - The Xinhua News Agency Headquarters today issued a solemn declaration. In response to the Hong Kong British authorities' unreasonable "sentencing" of Xinhua News Agency journalist Xue Ping to two years in prison and the illegal "interrogation" of other patriotic journalists, the agency has lodged the strongest and most vehement protest against the Hong Kong British authorities and the British Labour government. The declaration states that the Hong Kong British authorities' "sentencing" of Xue Ping is a thorough and complete act of fascist political persecution, and is completely illegal and invalid. The full text of the declaration is as follows:

	The Hong Kong British authorities, disregarding the serious warnings of the Chinese government, on July 19th brazenly "sentenced" Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch journalist Xue Ping to two years in prison, and continued the illegal "interrogation" of two other Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch journalists, Chen Fengying and Chen Demu, as well as five other patriotic journalists. This is a new serious crime committed by the Hong Kong British authorities and the British Labour government against the Hong Kong Chinese compatriots, and a new serious political provocation against the 700 million Chinese people. The Xinhua News Agency hereby lodges the strongest and most vehement protest against the Hong Kong British authorities and the British Labour government!

	The Xinhua News Agency solemnly declares: The Hong Kong British authorities' unreasonable "sentencing" of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch journalist Xue Ping is a thorough and complete act of fascist political persecution, and is completely illegal and invalid. The Hong Kong British authorities must immediately revoke this so-called "sentencing" of Xue Ping, immediately stop the illegal "interrogation" of the other two Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch journalists, Chen Fengying and Chen Demu, as well as the five other patriotic journalists, and immediately unconditionally release all these unjustly arrested Chinese patriotic news workers. The Hong Kong British authorities must also publicly acknowledge their mistake in the serious incident of unjustly arresting these Chinese patriotic news workers, compensate for all losses incurred by these Chinese patriotic news workers, punish the culprits, and ensure that similar incidents do not occur in the future. Otherwise, all serious consequences arising from this will be the sole responsibility of the Hong Kong British authorities and the British Labour government.

	The Hong Kong British authorities and the British Labour government must understand: The Chinese people have long since stood up. The era of the Chinese people being bullied by imperialism has long since passed. You foolishly attempt to use fascist persecution to suppress the influence of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution in China and to prevent Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch journalists and other Hong Kong patriotic news workers from reporting on the heroic deeds of Hong Kong compatriots in their love for the great leader Chairman Mao, their love for the invincible Mao Zedong Thought, and their struggles against British imperialism. This is absolutely impossible. The great leader Chairman Mao has said: "Lifting a rock only to drop it on one's own feet" is a Chinese proverb used to describe the behavior of certain fools. The various reactionaries of all countries are precisely such a bunch of fools. The Hong Kong British authorities and the British Labour government are precisely the reactionaries pointed out by the great leader Chairman Mao. The stone you are lifting today to make a serious political provocation against the 700 million Chinese people will ultimately fall heavily on your own feet.

	The Hong Kong British authorities and the British Labour government's fascist persecution of Xinhua News Agency Hong Kong branch journalists and other Hong Kong patriotic journalists is also a serious provocation against all just news workers around the world. The Xinhua News Agency appeals to all colleagues around the world who uphold justice to strongly condemn the fascist atrocities of the Hong Kong British authorities and the British Labour government, and to stop the evil hands of British imperialists who persecute Hong Kong Chinese patriotic news workers!

    新华通讯社总社严正声明
    港英当局对我记者无理“判决”完全非法和无效
    要求英帝立即无条件释放我记者，并保证今后不再发生类似事件。
    新华社二十日讯　新华通讯社总社今天发表严正声明，对港英当局无理“判决”新华社记者薛平入狱两年和非法“审讯”其他爱国记者的新的严重政治挑衅，向港英当局和英国工党政府提出最严重、最强烈的抗议。声明宣布港英当局对薛平的无理“判决”，是彻头彻尾的法西斯政治迫害，是完全非法和完全无效的。声明全文如下：
    香港英国当局不顾中国政府的严重警告，于七月十九日悍然“判决”新华社香港分社记者薛平入狱两年，并继续非法“审讯”新华社香港分社的另外两名记者陈凤英、陈德穆以及其他五名爱国记者。这是香港英国当局和英国工党政府对香港中国同胞犯下的新的严重罪行，也是香港英国当局和英国工党政府对七亿中国人民进行的新的严重政治挑衅。新华通讯社对此向香港英国当局和英国工党政府提出最严重、最强烈的抗议！
    新华通讯社严正声明：香港英国当局对新华社香港分社记者薛平的无理“判决”，是彻头彻尾的法西斯政治迫害，是完全非法的和完全无效的。香港英国当局必须立即撤销对薛平的这一所谓“判决”，立即停止对新华社香港分社另外两名记者陈凤英、陈德穆以及其他五名爱国记者的非法“审讯”，并且立即无条件释放所有这些被无理逮捕的中国爱国新闻工作者。香港英国当局还必须对它无理逮捕这些中国爱国新闻工作者的严重事件公开承认错误，赔偿这些中国爱国新闻工作者的一切损失，惩办凶手，保证今后不再发生类似事件。否则，由此发生的一切严重后果，完全由香港英国当局和英国工党政府负责。
    香港英国当局和英国工党政府必须明白：中国人民早已站起来了。中国人民任凭帝国主义欺负的时代，早已一去不复返了。你们妄想用法西斯迫害的手段，来遏止中国无产阶级文化大革命的影响，来阻止新华社香港分社记者和香港其他爱国新闻工作者报道香港同胞热爱伟大领袖毛主席、热爱战无不胜的毛泽东思想以及香港同胞反英抗暴斗争的英勇事迹，是绝对办不到的。中国人民的伟大领袖毛主席说过：“‘搬起石头打自己的脚’，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。”香港英国当局和英国工党政府，就是伟大领袖毛主席指出的这样的一批愚蠢的反动派。你们今天搬起的向七亿中国人民进行严重政治挑衅的这块石头，最终必将沉重地打在你们自己的脚上。
    香港英国当局和英国工党政府这次对新华社香港分社记者和香港其他爱国记者所进行的法西斯迫害，也是对全世界一切正义新闻工作者的严重挑衅。新华通讯社呼吁全世界一切主持正义的同业，强烈谴责香港英国当局和英国工党政府的这一法西斯暴行，制止英帝国主义者迫害香港中国爱国新闻工作者的罪恶黑手！
