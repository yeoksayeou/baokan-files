The Ne Win clique is a gang of fascist executioners.

	According to a report from Xinhua News Agency on the 21st, our correspondent reports: Since the Ne Win reactionary government came to power through a military coup in March 1962, it has implemented naked fascist military dictatorship, brutally suppressing the Burmese people, fully exposing its anti-communist, anti-people, counter-revolutionary nature.

	The Ne Win military clique was originally the largest bureaucratic capitalist group in Burma. By early 1962, it had already controlled a massive amount of capital second only to state capital. After coming to power, this military clique established a "Revolutionary Council" composed of seventeen officers—the military government. Ne Win, in the name of the "Revolutionary Council" chairman, monopolized administrative, legislative, and judicial powers. At the local level, it retained the grassroots power in the hands of landlords and rich peasants. Thus, the Ne Win fascist dictatorship government was completely a reactionary regime representing the interests of the Burmese landlord class and bureaucratic bourgeoisie.

	To strengthen its fascist dictatorship, the Ne Win military clique took a series of reactionary measures, stripping the Burmese people of their most basic democratic rights. It established various levels of "Security Administrative Committees" from the central government to local levels to implement secret police rule over the entire population, set up "Special Criminal Courts" to suppress the people, and frequently declared martial law. This military clique, following in the footsteps of Hitler and Chiang Kai-shek, promoted the reactionary slogan of "one party (the Socialist Program Party), one ideology (the Socialist Program), and one leader (Ne Win)." In July 1962, it announced the establishment of the "Socialist Program Party" with military personnel as the backbone, serving as its tool for ruling and suppressing the people. In March 1964, the Ne Win clique openly implemented its fascist one-party dictatorship plan, ordering the dissolution of all parties and organizations except the "Socialist Program Party" and religious groups, and strictly prohibiting all political activities and the establishment of new parties. The Ne Win reactionary government strangled the people's freedom of speech and publication, issuing fascist publication regulations, establishing the official "Burma News Agency," and nationalizing many newspapers to monopolize and control them.

	The Ne Win clique is a gang of fascist executioners who rose to power through suppressing and massacring the people. Just four months after coming to power, it staged the bloody massacre of Rangoon University, committing a major atrocity against Burmese patriotic and progressive students. Subsequently, it launched a nationwide wave of arrests, throwing tens of thousands of patriotic and progressive individuals into prison.

	After that, almost every year saw fascist incidents of the Ne Win reactionary government suppressing students.

	After coming to power, the Ne Win reactionary government has consistently and madly suppressed the vast majority of Burmese workers and peasants, plundering the middle and small industrial and commercial sectors like bandits.

	The Ne Win reactionary government has carried out brutal armed suppression against the Burmese ethnic minorities and dispatched troops to directly control the border areas where ethnic minorities reside. It has plundered the resources of ethnic minority areas, keeping the economies of ethnic minorities in a long-term backward state.

	The Ne Win clique is also the chief culprit of the Burmese counter-revolutionary civil war. Before coming to power, it had long been engaged in suppressing and massacring the Burmese revolutionary people in the civil war. After coming to power, relying on imperialist aid, it raised a reactionary army, madly suppressing the revolutionary armed struggle led by the Burmese Communist Party. This gang of bloodthirsty reactionaries, waging war recklessly, "swept" through revolutionary armed forces, burned hundreds of villages, turned many villages into concentration camps, and massacred tens of thousands of revolutionary people and communists.

	In 1963, after the Ne Win reactionary government's attempt to eliminate the people's armed forces through negotiations failed, it launched a nationwide wave of arrests. In just six days from November 15 to 21, the Burmese reactionary government arrested more than 730 progressive individuals. Up to now, the Ne Win reactionary government has never stopped its fascist atrocities of hunting down Burmese communists and progressive individuals.

	In the past two years, the people's armed struggle led by the Burmese Communist Party has rapidly developed and grown stronger, making the Ne Win reactionary government extremely terrified and anxious. It attempted to make a desperate struggle, openly declaring that it would intensify the civil war. At the officer meeting and "Socialist Program Party" symposium held in November 1966, Ne Win announced that he would resolutely fight the civil war to the end. The Burmese reactionary government also mobilized its controlled propaganda machinery to slander and defame the people's armed forces led by the Burmese Communist Party, creating anti-communist public opinion. The Ne Win reactionary government mobilized about 40% of its total troops to wage an anti-communist, anti-people civil war. Last winter and this spring, the Ne Win reactionary government's army launched a "concentrated attack" on the people's armed forces in the delta region and conducted "sweeps" in the Pegu and Danu regions.

	Great Leader Chairman Mao teaches us: "To create disorder, fail, create more disorder, fail again, until they are wiped out—that is the logic of imperialism and all reactionaries in the world when dealing with the people's cause. They will never deviate from this logic." The Ne Win clique's crimes of dictatorship, betrayal, anti-communism, and anti-people are piled high. The Burmese people have already recognized it as the public enemy. Under the leadership of the Burmese Communist Party, the Burmese revolutionary people, who are persistently engaged in armed struggle, will surely overthrow the Ne Win fascist dictatorship regime and strive for complete liberation.

    屠杀人民　镇压革命　残暴成性　罪行累累
    奈温集团是一伙法西斯刽子手
    据新华社二十一日讯  本社记者报道：奈温反动政府从一九六二年三月通过军事政变上台以后，实行赤裸裸的法西斯军事独裁，残酷地镇压缅甸人民，彻底暴露了它的反共、反人民的反革命面目。
    奈温军人集团本来是缅甸最大的官僚资本集团，它在一九六二年初就已经控制了仅次于国家资本的巨额资本。这个军人集团上台以后，成立了由十七名军官组成的“革命委员会”——军人政府。奈温以“革命委员会”主席的名义，独揽行政、立法和司法大权。在地方，它原封不动地保留了掌握在地主富农手中的基层政权。这样建立起来的奈温法西斯独裁政府，完全是一个代表缅甸地主阶级和官僚资产阶级的利益的反动政权。
    奈温军人集团为了加强它的法西斯独裁统治，采取了一系列的反动措施，剥夺了缅甸人民最起码的民主权利。它从中央到地方建立了对全国人民实行特务统治的各级“安全行政委员会”，设立了镇压人民的“特别刑事法庭”，并且经常宣布实行“军事戒严”。这个军人集团继承希特勒和蒋介石的衣钵，推行着“一个政党
  （社会主义纲领党）、一个主义（社会主义纲领）和一个领袖（奈温）”的反动纲领，在一九六二年七月宣布成立以军人为骨干的“社会主义纲领党”，充当它统治和镇压人民的工具。一九六四年三月，奈温集团公开执行它的法西斯一党专政计划，下令解散了除“社会主义纲领党”和宗教团体以外的一切政党和团体，并且严格禁止一切政治活动和成立新的政党。奈温反动政府扼杀人民的言论出版自由，颁布了法西斯的出版条例，成立了官办的“缅甸通讯社”，并把许多报纸“收归国有”，进行垄断和控制。
    奈温集团是靠镇压和屠杀人民起家的法西斯刽子手。在它上台后刚刚四个月，就在仰光制造了血洗仰光大学，对缅甸爱国进步学生进行血腥大屠杀的大惨案。接着又在全国发动了大逮捕，把成千上万的爱国进步人士投入监狱。
    在此以后，几乎每年都发生奈温反动政府镇压学生的法西斯事件。
    奈温反动政府上台以后，一贯疯狂地镇压缅甸的广大工人、农民，对缅甸的中小工商业者进行了强盗式的掠夺。
    奈温反动政府对缅甸少数民族进行残酷的武装镇压，并且派出军队直接控制少数民族居住的边境地区。它对少数民族地区的资源大肆掠夺，使少数民族的经济长期处于落后状态。
    奈温集团也是发动缅甸反革命内战的罪魁祸首。它在上台以前，长期从事镇压和屠杀缅甸革命人民的内战。它上台以后，依靠帝国主义的援助，豢养一支反动军队，疯狂镇压缅甸共产党领导的革命武装斗争。这一伙嗜血成性的反动家伙，穷兵黩武，“扫荡”革命武装力量，烧毁了成百成千的村庄，把许多村庄变成了集中营，并且屠杀了成千上万的革命人民和共产党人。
    一九六三年，奈温反动政府企图通过谈判消灭人民武装力量的阴谋破产以后，在全国范围内进行大逮捕。仅仅在十一月十五日到二十一日的六天当中，缅甸反动政府就逮捕了进步人士七百三十多人。直到现在为止，奈温反动政府从未停止搜捕缅甸共产党人和进步人士的法西斯暴行。
    最近两年来，缅甸共产党领导的人民武装斗争迅速发展壮大，奈温反动政府感到十分惊恐不安，妄图进行垂死的挣扎，公开叫嚷要加紧进行内战。奈温在一九六六年十一月召开的军官会议和“社会主义纲领党”座谈会上，宣布要坚决把内战打到底。缅甸反动政府并动员它控制下的宣传工具，对缅共领导的人民武装大肆进行诬蔑诽谤，制造反共舆论。奈温反动政府调动了约占它全部兵力的百分之四十的军队，来进行反共反人民的内战。去冬今春以来，奈温反动政府军向三角洲地区的人民武装发动了“重点进攻”，在勃固、丹老地区也进行了“扫荡”。
    伟大领袖毛主席教导我们：“捣乱，失败，再捣乱，再失败，直至灭亡——这就是帝国主义和世界上一切反动派对待人民事业的逻辑，他们决不会违背这个逻辑的。”奈温集团独裁、卖国、反共、反人民的罪行累累，缅甸人民已经认清它是缅甸人民的公敌。在缅甸共产党领导下坚持武装斗争的缅甸革命人民，必将打倒奈温法西斯独裁政权，争取彻底解放。
