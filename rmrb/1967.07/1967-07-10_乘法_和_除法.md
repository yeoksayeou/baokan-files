Title: Multiplication and Division

During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, many comrades carefully calculated and saved every bit, believing that if everyone saves a little, the nation of 700 million people can save a great deal of wealth. They used multiplication to calculate. However, there are also some people who are wasteful and careless. These people think: what's the big deal if we use a bit more? When divided among 700 million people, each person only uses a little bit. They used division to calculate.

Here, whether to use "multiplication" or "division" is not just a simple calculation method issue, but a worldview issue: whether to view the world with the eyes of a proletarian revolutionary or with the eyes of a bourgeois individualist.

Using "multiplication," what accumulates is not only material wealth, but more importantly, the spiritual wealth of communism. Using "division," what is eliminated is not only a large amount of precious resources, but more importantly, the revolutionary spirit of the proletariat.

　　“乘法”和“除法”
    在无产阶级文化大革命的运动中，许多同志精打细算，点滴节约，他们认为：每个人节约一点点，全国七亿人口就能节约一笔很大的财富。他们是用乘法来算账的。可是，也有一些人大手大脚，满不在乎，这些人认为：多用点算什么？七亿人口一平均，每人才摊多大一点？他们是用除法来算账的。
    在这里，用“乘法”还是用“除法”，不是一个简单的计算方法问题，而是一个世界观问题：是用无产阶级革命战士的眼光看世界，还是用资产阶级个人主义的眼光看世界。
    用“乘法”，积累起来的不仅是一笔物质财富，更重要的是共产主义的精神财富。用“除法”，除掉的不仅是大量宝贵的物资，更重要的是无产阶级的革命本色。　洪岭
