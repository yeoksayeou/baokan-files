In the midst of the triumphant songs of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, following the joyous news of a bumper harvest of summer grain and rapeseed nationwide, there are continuous reports of the enthusiastic participation of rural commune members in selling wheat and rapeseed to the state.

By the end of June, the summer harvest began earlier in Sichuan Province, with eight prefectures and cities, including Yibin, Jiangjin, Leshan, Ya'an, Xichang, Chengdu, Chongqing, and Zigong, having completed their summer grain procurement plans in excess. The main wheat-producing area of Henan Province has completed 80% of its summer grain procurement plan, Anhui Province has completed over 70% of its plan, and Shandong Province has 37 counties and cities that have completed over 70% of their plans. In the main rapeseed-producing areas of Shanghai's suburbs, Suzhou Prefecture in Jiangsu Province, and the areas of Wenjiang, Mianyang, and Yibin in Sichuan Province, the rapeseed procurement plans have been completed in excess. While doing a good job in grain and oil procurement, the living arrangements for rural people have been carefully made. It is generally reflected that the living arrangements for rural people this summer are better than in previous years, and many communes and production brigades have increased their collective grain reserves.

The unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution has powerfully promoted this year's summer grain and oil procurement. The broad masses of poor and lower-middle peasants, revolutionary commune members, and revolutionary cadres of communes and production brigades have enthusiastically responded to the great call of our great leader Chairman Mao to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, using the invincible Mao Zedong Thought as a weapon. In the great struggle and criticism of the capitalist roaders within the Party who are in power, they have exposed and criticized the poisonous influence of the capitalist reactionary line on the grain issue. They follow Chairman Mao's instructions on "preparing for war, preparing for famine, and serving the people," and his teachings on "in the matter of distribution, we must take into account the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual." They reasonably arrange the distribution of the commune and brigade, actively sell surplus grain and oil to the state, and sell good grain and good oil. They say: We have achieved a bumper harvest of summer grain relying on Mao Zedong Thought, and we must follow Chairman Mao's instructions to properly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, and sell more surplus grain. They say that actively selling surplus grain and oil, completing and exceeding the summer grain and oil procurement tasks, is a contribution to consolidating the socialist system, consolidating the dictatorship of the proletariat, and supporting the socialist construction of the country. It is supporting the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution and is a resolute response to the handful of capitalist-roaders within the Party.

In the high tide of the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the revolutionary committees or production command departments and revolutionary cadres of the grain departments at various levels have bravely shouldered the dual responsibilities of revolution and production. They have promoted production through revolution and work through revolution, and strengthened the leadership of summer grain and oil procurement. They have held high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, emphasized proletarian politics, gone deep into the communes and brigades, and together with the broad masses of commune members, actively studied and applied Chairman Mao's works, propagated Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies. They have delivered the materials needed for agricultural production and the lives of peasants to their doorsteps. At the same time, following Chairman Mao's instructions, they have helped the production brigades correctly handle the relationship between the state, the collective, and the individual, and done a good job in the procurement and distribution of summer grain and oil. Many regions' grain procurement stations have set up Mao Zedong Thought propaganda tents, assigned personnel to propagate Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies to the commune members, and guided the commune members in studying Chairman Mao's works. They have also warmly taken care of the lives of the commune members who deliver grain. All of these have been warmly welcomed by the broad masses of commune members.

The soldiers of the People's Liberation Army have actively responded to Chairman Mao's great call to support the left, support industry, support agriculture, implement military control, and military training. They have firmly supported the summer harvest and summer planting, and at the same time, helped the communes do a good job in the procurement of summer grain and oil, which has played a significant role in promoting the completion of this year's summer grain and oil procurement tasks.

Currently, the procurement of summer grain and oil is still being carried out intensively. The relevant departments require that the leading organs at all levels, the revolutionary cadres of the grain departments, and the broad masses of commune members continue to hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, actively study and apply Chairman Mao's works, grasp the struggle between the two classes, the two lines, and the two roads, eliminate selfishness and establish public spirit, strengthen leadership, and on the principle of considering the interests of the state, the collective, and the individual, reasonably arrange and implement the plan, reasonably arrange the labor force in rural areas, while doing a good job in summer planting, grasp the collection, threshing, and drying of grain and oil, and timely deliver grain to the warehouse and do a good job in the processing and transportation of grain and oil. On the basis of implementing the Party's policies and mobilizing the masses, strive to complete and exceed the summer grain and oil procurement plan for the whole country as soon as possible this year.

    支持文化大革命和国家建设正确处理国家集体和个人三者关系
    广大农村社员踊跃交售小麦油菜籽
    不少地区已经完成夏季粮油征购计划。各地农村人民生活安排比往年好，许多社队的集体储备粮有所增加
    据新华社十二日讯　在无产阶级文化大革命的凯歌声中，继广大农村传来全国夏粮和油菜籽大丰收的喜讯之后，又不断传来广大农村人民公社社员踊跃向国家交售小麦和油菜籽的振奋人心的消息。
    到六月底止，夏收开始较早的四川省已经有宜宾、江津、乐山、雅安、西昌、成都、重庆、自贡等八个专区、市超额完成了夏粮征购计划。主要小麦产区的河南省已经完成夏粮征购计划的百分之八十，安徽省已经完成夏粮征购计划的百分之七十以上，山东省有三十七个县市已经完成夏粮征购计划的百分之七十以上。油菜籽主要产区的上海市郊、江苏省苏州专区和四川省温江、绵阳、宜宾等地区的油菜籽收购计划已经超额完成。各地在做好粮油征购工作的同时，对农村人民生活进行了认真的安排。各地普遍反映，今年夏季农村人民生活的安排比往年好，许多公社、生产大队的集体储备粮有所增加。
    史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命运动，有力地推动了今年的夏季粮油征购。广大贫下中农、革命的社员群众和公社、生产大队的革命干部，热烈响应我们伟大领袖毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，活学活用毛主席著作，以战无不胜的毛泽东思想为武器，在对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判、大斗争中，揭露和批判了资产阶级反动路线在粮食问题上的流毒。他们遵循毛主席关于“备战、备荒、为人民”的教导，遵循毛主席关于“在分配问题上，我们必须兼顾国家利益、集体利益和个人利益”的教导，合理安排社队的分配，积极向国家交售余粮和油料，交售好粮和好油料。他们表示：我们靠毛泽东思想夺得了夏粮大丰收，更要按毛主席的指示，摆正国家、集体、个人三者的关系，多交售余粮。他们说，积极交售余粮和油料，完成和超额完成夏季粮食、油料交售任务，就是为巩固社会主义制度，巩固无产阶级专政和支援国家社会主义建设贡献力量，就是支持无产阶级文化大革命，就是对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的坚决回击。很多地区、很多生产队在夏粮和油菜籽收打完毕之后，很快掀起了送粮送油料入库的高潮。有些生产队的社员，主动要求超额交售，有些夏粮获得大丰收的专区、县、社、队，纷纷表示要一季完成全年的粮食交售任务，争取对国家作出最大的贡献。
    在无产阶级文化大革命的高潮中，各级革命委员会或生产指挥部和粮食部门无产阶级革命派，勇敢地挑起革命和生产两副重担，以革命促生产，以革命促工作，切实加强了对夏季粮油征购的领导工作。他们高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，突出无产阶级政治，深入社队，同广大社员群众一起活学活用毛主席著作，宣传毛泽东思想、党的政策，把农业生产和农民生活需要的物资送上门去。同时，按照毛主席的教导，帮助生产队正确处理国家、集体和个人三者之间的关系，搞好夏季粮油征购和分配工作。许多地区的粮食收购站，设立了毛泽东思想宣传棚，配备专人向社员群众宣传毛泽东思想，宣传党的政策，辅导社员群众学习毛主席著作。对于送粮社员的生活也热情加以照顾。所有这些，都受到广大社员群众的欢迎。
    人民解放军指战员积极响应毛主席提出的支左、支工、支农、军管、军训的伟大号召，坚定不移地支援夏收、夏种，同时注意帮助社队做好夏季粮食、油料交售工作，对于促进今年夏季粮油征购任务的完成起了很大的作用。
    目前，夏季粮油征购还在继续紧张地进行。有关部门要求各地各级领导机关、粮食部门的无产阶级革命派和广大社员群众，要继续高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，活学活用毛主席著作，狠抓两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线的斗争，破私立公，加强领导，在兼顾国家、集体和个人三者利益的原则下，切实安排和落实计划，合理安排农村的劳动力，在搞好夏种的同时，抓紧粮食油料的收打晾晒，及时送粮入库和做好粮油的加工调运工作，在贯彻党的政策和发动群众的基础上，力争尽快地完成和超额完成今年全国的夏季粮油征购计划。
