Catch the Enemy Off Guard and Strike When They Least Expect It: South Vietnamese Liberation Army Launches a Sudden Attack on the American Airbase in Da Nang

In just five minutes of battle, 42 American planes were destroyed or damaged, and nearly 200 American soldiers were killed or injured.

Xinhua News Agency, July 15th: Saigon news: On the 15th, the armed forces of South Vietnam launched a sudden and fierce attack on the largest American airbase in South Vietnam, Da Nang, achieving a resounding victory and inflicting a devastating blow on the base. Preliminary reports indicate that 42 enemy planes were destroyed or damaged, and more than 180 American invaders were killed or injured. The runway and other facilities at the airport were riddled with shell holes. The airport remained closed for 12 hours after the attack.

According to reports, early in the morning of that day, two units of the South Vietnamese armed forces, which had been lying in ambush at the southwest and northwest corners of the base, simultaneously launched a fierce and swift artillery barrage against the base, which was protected by 7,000 U.S. Marines and a large number of puppet troops. In this brief, five-minute surprise attack, the liberation forces' shells accurately struck the airport's parking apron, turning many jet fighters and large transport planes into fragments that flew into the sky. The bombs and fuel carried by the planes also caused a series of explosions and fierce fires. Shells also hit the warehouse area where a large number of heavy bombs were stored, causing powerful explosions and fires, with flames soaring over a thousand meters high. Four American air force barracks were also hit, and many American airmen, startled from their sleep, frantically tried to escape but were hit by flying shrapnel and plane debris. The airport's post office building and other facilities were also destroyed by shells and exploding bombs. After the attack, the base was in chaos, with craters, shrapnel, and plane debris everywhere.

The brave and clever liberation forces' fierce attack on the American Da Nang airbase came just after U.S. Secretary of Defense McNamara left Saigon, where he had been plotting further escalation of the war in Vietnam. McNamara spent five days in South Vietnam from the 7th to the 11th, engaging in conspiracy activities and making military deployments to expand the war of aggression with the U.S. military leaders in Vietnam. The heavy blow dealt by the liberation forces is a warning to Johnson, McNamara, and their ilk: the U.S. escalation of the war in Vietnam will only lead to greater failure and cannot save the inevitable final defeat of the U.S. in the South Vietnamese battlefield.

    出其不意攻其不备　打得敌人胆战心惊
    南越解放军猛袭岘港美空军基地
    五分钟战斗就毁伤美机四十二架毙伤美军近二百名
    新华社十五日讯　西贡消息：越南南方解放武装力量十五日对美国侵略军在南越的最大的岘港空军基地进行了出其不意的猛烈袭击，取得了极其辉煌的战果，使这个空军基地遭到了破坏性的打击。据初步消息，共击毁击伤敌机四十二架，打死打伤美国侵略军一百八十多名，机场的跑道和其他的设施被炮弹打得千疮百孔，在这次袭击以后的十二小时内，机场仍在关闭中。
    据报道，当天凌晨，预先埋伏在这个空军基地的西南和西北角上的南方解放武装力量的两支部队，同时对这个由七千名美国海军陆战队和大量伪军保护的基地进行了最猛烈和快速的炮击。在这次只有短短五分多钟的奇袭中，解放武装力量的炮弹准确地击中了机场的停机坪，许多喷气式战斗轰炸机和巨型的运输机都化成碎片冲上天空，飞机携带的炸弹和燃料也引起了连续的爆炸和猛烈的大火。炮弹还击中了存放大量重型炸弹的仓库区，发生了强烈的爆炸和大火，火焰冲上天空一千多米高。四座美国空军人员的营房也被击中，许多从睡梦中惊醒的美国空军人员惊慌失措，拚命往外逃命，但却被到处纷飞的弹片和飞机碎片打中受伤。机场的邮电大楼和其他一些设施也被炮弹和爆炸的炸弹摧毁。在这次袭击以后，基地里到处都是弹坑、弹片和飞机的碎片，陷入一片混乱之中。
    英勇机智的解放武装力量对美国岘港空军基地的这一次猛烈的袭击，是在美国国防部长麦克纳马拉到南越来策划进一步扩大侵越战争以后刚刚离开西贡不久进行的。麦克纳马拉从七日到十一日在南越进行了五天的阴谋活动，同侵越美军头目一起进行了扩大侵略战争的军事部署。解放武装力量的这次沉重的打击是警告约翰逊、麦克纳马拉之流：美国扩大侵越战争除了更大的失败之外，根本挽救不了美国在南越战场上最后失败的定局。（附图片）
