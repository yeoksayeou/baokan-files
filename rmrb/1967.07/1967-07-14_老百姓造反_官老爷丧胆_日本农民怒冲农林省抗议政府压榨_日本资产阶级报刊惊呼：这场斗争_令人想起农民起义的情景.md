The people revolt, officials tremble
Japanese farmers storm the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry to protest government exploitation
Japanese bourgeois newspapers exclaim: This struggle "reminds one of a peasant uprising"

New China News Agency, Tokyo, July 13th: Over a thousand farmer representatives from all over Japan gathered in Tokyo on the 12th and rushed to the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry (Agriculture Department) of the Sato government to oppose the Sato government's policy of lowering the purchase price of rice.

For a long time, U.S. imperialism and Japanese monopoly capital have implemented reactionary policies of ruthless exploitation and oppression of Japanese farmers, forcing farmers to live a life of breathlessness. Unable to endure any longer, they finally exploded in anger against the U.S.-Japanese reactionaries and bravely rose up to rebel against the Sato government of Japan.

The farmer representatives, carrying red flags and wearing banners with various slogans, were all spirited, dignified, and full of fighting spirit.

The Japanese government, as if facing a major crisis, set up a row of barriers in front of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry in an attempt to block the farmers' advance. At the same time, they sent a large number of armed police to suppress the movement.

The farmer representatives paid no heed to the enemy's threats. They firmly demanded an audience with the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, Komoku Tadashi, and the removal of the insulting barriers and the withdrawal of the armed police sent to suppress the people. However, after a long time of negotiations, all the reasonable demands of the representatives were unreasonably rejected by the Japanese government.

At this moment, the angry farmers shouted slogans such as "Charge ahead!" and "The Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, get out quickly!" In an instant, they pushed over the barriers, cleared the armed police's obstruction, and stormed into the office building of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry. The farmers overturned the officials' desks, and suddenly, documents and papers flew everywhere. When the farmers rushed to the "Minister's Room," that minister had already fled in terror, like a rat.

The angry farmers turned the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry's office into a place to denounce the Japanese reactionaries.

The Japanese ruling class was greatly alarmed and quickly dispatched fully armed police to suppress the movement. The fearless farmer representatives continued to persist in their struggle unyieldingly until late at night.

This peasant struggle is excellent! It boosts the morale of the revolutionary people and crushes the arrogance of the reactionaries. The Japanese bourgeois newspaper "Yomiuri Shimbun" said in alarm on the 13th: "This struggle is very intense and reminds one of a peasant uprising."

    老百姓造反　官老爷丧胆
    日本农民怒冲农林省抗议政府压榨
    日本资产阶级报刊惊呼：这场斗争“令人想起农民起义的情景”
    新华社东京十三日电  来自日本全国各地的一千多名农民代表，十二日在东京涌向佐藤政府的农林省（农业部）门前，反对佐藤政府压低收购大米的价格。
    美帝国主义和日本垄断资本长期以来推行残酷剥削和压榨日本农民的反动政策，迫使农民过着喘不过气的生活。他们忍无可忍，终于爆发了对美日反动派的愤怒，勇敢地起来造日本佐藤政府的反。
    农民代表们打着红旗，肩上披着写有各种斗争口号的布带，个个精神抖擞，威风凛凛，斗志昂扬。
    日本政府如临大敌，在农林省门前架起一排栅栏，妄图阻挡农民前进。同时还丧心病狂地派出大批武装警察进行镇压。
    农民代表们根本不把敌人的威胁放在眼里，他们坚决要求会见农林大臣仓目忠雄，要求拆除侮辱性的栅栏，撤退前来进行镇压人民的武装警察。但经过长时间的交涉，代表们的一切正当要求都被日本政府无理拒绝。
    这时候，愤怒的农民们高喊“冲呵！”“农林大臣快滚出来”等口号，瞬间，推倒了栅栏，排除了武装警察的阻挡，冲进了农林省的办公楼。农民们把官儿老爷们的办公桌打翻在地，顿时，文件等满天飞。当农民们冲到“大臣室”时，那个大臣早已吓得魂不附体，象老鼠一样逃掉了。
    愤怒的农民们把农林大臣办公的地方变成了控诉日本反动派的场所。
    日本统治阶级大为惊惶失措，赶紧增派全副武装的警察，前去镇压。不畏强暴的农民代表们继续不屈不挠地坚持进行斗争，直到深夜。
    这一场农民斗争，好得很！它长了革命人民的志气，灭了反动派的威风。日本资产阶级报纸《读卖新闻》十三日惊慌地说：这场斗争“非常激烈，令人想起农民起义的情景。”
