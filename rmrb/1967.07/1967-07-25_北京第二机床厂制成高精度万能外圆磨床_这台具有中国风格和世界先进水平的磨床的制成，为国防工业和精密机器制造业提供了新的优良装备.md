The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Beijing Second Machine Tool Factory has resolutely responded to Chairman Mao's great call to "grasp revolution and promote production." They have displayed a daring spirit of creation, independently designing and successfully manufacturing a high-precision universal cylindrical grinder with a Chinese style and advanced world level. This provides new excellent equipment for the defense industry and precision machinery manufacturing industry. This is a brilliant achievement obtained during the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution.

This high-precision universal cylindrical grinder, which has been appraised by the state and fully meets the design requirements, adopts many advanced technologies that have been successfully researched domestically. For example, static pressure bearings are used on both the grinding wheel main shaft and the workpiece main shaft, and the workpiece speed control adopts a silicon-controlled stepless speed regulation system. The grinding efficiency of this machine tool exceeds that of similar imported machine tools, and the smoothness of the inner and outer circles of the ground workpieces is stably maintained at level fourteen (the highest level of smoothness standard).

Should we design and manufacture high-precision universal cylindrical grinders with what kind of ideology and methods? Should we be constrained by foreign frameworks, follow in the footsteps of foreigners, and simply imitate them? Or should we break superstitions, dare to create, and insist on the road of self-reliance? Around the design and manufacture of the grinder, the struggle between these two ideologies has been intense. Before the Cultural Revolution, the factory was under the control of a handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, who suppressed the wisdom and talents of the revolutionary masses. They vigorously promoted the decayed ideology of worshipping foreign things, claiming that the design and manufacture of machine tools and grinders must follow foreign examples, even proposing the absurd slogan of "only allowing 'copying the cat' but not 'copying the tiger'." In 1964, under the direct command and participation of this handful of capitalist-roaders within the party, a new machine tool was produced. Its structure was complicated, the cost was high, and the rigidity was weak, and it was ridiculed by the workers as a "Lin Daiyu-style" machine tool. After the Cultural Revolution began, the proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory fought resolutely against this ideology. They insisted on their own path. In the process of designing and manufacturing the high-precision universal cylindrical grinder, the designers followed Chairman Mao's teachings. On one hand, they visited dozens of factories in Shanghai, Shenyang, and other places to conduct in-depth and detailed investigations and research with these users; on the other hand, they labored with the workers, bringing the drawings to the workshop to discuss and study with the workers, and humbly listened to their opinions. The workers, in the process of manufacturing, started from reality and dared to innovate. They proudly said: We are proletarian revolutionaries armed with Mao Zedong Thought. We do not believe in foreigners, dare to innovate in technology, strive for self-improvement, and self-reliance. We will definitely leave imperialism and revisionism far behind.

The workers and technicians who participated in the design and manufacture are not "experts," but a group of ordinary "small people." They came out with red hearts full of loyalty to the party and the people's cause. In the process of work, they seriously studied Chairman Mao's works. The more they studied, the brighter their minds became, and the more their fighting spirit soared. In this way, they overcame one technical peak after another.

    北京第二机床厂制成高精度万能外圆磨床
    这台具有中国风格和世界先进水平的磨床的制成，为国防工业和精密机器制造业提供了新的优良装备
    据新华社二十一日讯　北京第二机床厂的无产阶级革命派，坚决响应毛主席“抓革命，促生产”的伟大号召，发扬敢于创造的革命精神，自行设计和制造成功了一台中国风格的具有世界先进水平的高精度万能外圆磨床，为国防工业和精密机器制造业提供了新的优良装备。这是在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中取得的一项光辉硕果。
    这台经过国家鉴定，完全符合设计要求的高精度万能外圆磨床，采用了国内研究成功的许多先进技术。如在砂轮主轴和工件主轴上都采用了静压轴承，工件调速采用了硅可控无级调速系统等。这台机床的磨削效率超过同类型的进口机床，磨出工件的内圆和外圆的光洁度，都稳定在十四级（光洁度标准的最高级）。
    用什么思想和方法去设计和制造高精度万能外圆磨床？是受洋框框的束缚、步外国人的后尘单纯模仿呢？还是破除迷信，敢于创造，坚持走自力更生的道路？围绕磨床的设计和制造，这两种思想的斗争一直很激烈。在文化大革命前，这个厂在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的控制下，扼杀革命群众的聪明才智。他们大肆宣扬崇洋的腐朽思想，说什么机床、磨床的设计、制造，都要以外国的为样板，甚至提出只准“照猫画猫”不准“照猫画虎”的荒谬口号。一九六四年，在这个厂的党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的直接指挥和参预下，搞了一台新机床，结构繁琐，造价昂贵，刚性很弱，被工人讥讽为“林黛玉式”的机床。文化大革命开展以后，这个厂的无产阶级革命派同这种思想作了坚决的斗争，他们坚持走自己的路。在高精度万能外圆磨床的设计和制造过程中，设计人员遵循毛主席的教导，一面到上海、沈阳等地访问了几十个工厂，向这些用户作了深入细致的调查研究；另一面又同工人一起劳动，把图纸带到车间同工人一起琢磨研究，虚心听取意见。工人在制造过程中，从实际出发，大胆创新。他们豪迈地说：我们是用毛泽东思想武装起来的无产阶级革命派，不迷信洋人，技术敢创新，奋发图强，自力更生，定把帝国主义、修正主义远远抛在后边。
    参加设计制造的工人、技术人员不是什么“专家”，而是一批普普通通的“小人物”。他们带着对党对人民事业无限忠诚的红心杀出来了。在工作过程中，他们认真地学习毛主席著作。他们越学心里越明亮，越学斗志越高昂。就这样，他们攻克了一个又一个的技术尖端。
