In the unprecedented Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, the broad masses of young students, amidst the storms and waves of class struggle, have grown rapidly and vigorously. This is a great victory for Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line in nurturing the younger generation.

However, the family remains an important battlefield for educating the younger generation, and parents still bear a heavy responsibility for educating their children. In the current campaign to return to school and make revolution, utilizing the family as a battlefield to mobilize parents to cooperate with schools in enhancing students' revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline is a crucial link in successfully carrying out the campaign to return to school and make revolution.

How to mobilize parents to assist schools in successfully carrying out the campaign to return to school and make revolution? First, we must use the great thoughts of Mao Zedong to educate and mobilize parents. Only when parents themselves are armed with Mao Zedong Thought, firmly stand on Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, and understand the great significance of returning to school and making revolution, can they play a role in both personal example and verbal instruction on their children.

The PLA comrades conducting military training at Guiyang No. 1 Middle School have fully mobilized student parents to assist the school in successfully carrying out the campaign to return to school and make revolution. This is a good and correct approach. Their experience is worth learning from.

According to a report from our newspaper, the PLA comrades conducting military training at Guiyang No. 1 Middle School have deeply and meticulously used Mao Zedong Thought to educate and mobilize parents, cooperating with the school to jointly educate students to enhance their revolutionary spirit, scientific attitude, and organizational discipline, effectively ensuring the smooth progress of the campaign to return to school and make revolution.

In March of this year, the broad revolutionary factions of teachers and students at Guiyang No. 1 Middle School enthusiastically responded to the call of the great leader Chairman Mao, actively returning to school to make revolution. However, some students delayed returning to school. This was because some did not fully understand the great significance of returning to school and making revolution, some were influenced by the bourgeois reactionary line and were in serious conflict with other students, and some felt more "free" outside of school. Even among the students who had returned to school, some could not focus on their studies, and their organizational discipline was poor. These situations seriously affected the smooth progress of the campaign to return to school and make revolution.

After a short period of exploration, the PLA comrades believed that to do a good job with these students, it was not enough to rely solely on the PLA comrades and some revolutionary teachers and students who had returned to school. They also had to mobilize the students' parents to jointly strengthen the education of the students. Therefore, they adopted methods such as visiting student parents, holding parent meetings, and writing letters to parents to conduct in-depth and meticulous political thought work with the parents.

Whether parents can have a good educational influence on their children first depends on whether their minds are armed with Mao Zedong Thought. Therefore, when visiting student parents, the PLA comrades first studied Mao Zedong's works or quotations with them, propagating Mao Zedong Thought and the Party's policies. At the same time, they addressed each parent's specific situation, grasped their living thoughts, and conducted in-depth and meticulous political thought work.

Some parents did not pay attention to the campaign to return to school and make revolution, thinking it was a matter for students and teachers and had little to do with the family. The PLA comrades repeatedly explained to them that the campaign to return to school and make revolution is a battle call from the great leader Chairman Mao, which has great significance for cultivating successors to the proletarian revolutionary cause and for carrying out the cultural revolution in schools. Once the parents' understanding was raised, they actively educated their children to return to school to participate in the campaign to return to school and make revolution. Some parents even personally sent their children to school.

Some parents had long adopted a laissez-faire attitude towards their children, rarely caring about their political and ideological growth, and even when they saw their children making mistakes in this proletarian cultural revolution, they did not seriously criticize and educate them. The PLA comrades studied Mao Zedong's teachings with these parents: "The imperialist prophets, based on the changes in the Soviet Union, also placed their hopes for 'peaceful evolution' on the third or fourth generation of the Chinese Communist Party. We must make the imperialists' prophecy completely fail. We must, from top to bottom, universally, and continuously pay attention to cultivating and fostering successors to the revolutionary cause." These parents thus realized that educating their children is a major issue related to whether China will undergo 'peaceful evolution' and must strengthen the education of their children with Mao Zedong Thought. A parent of a student in Class 4, New Four, originally thought that the child was grown up and did not need much attention from adults, resulting in the child joining the wrong faction in the great proletarian cultural revolution without knowing it; when hearing the PLA comrades talk about the child's situation, he was greatly shocked. With the help of the PLA comrades, he deeply felt that he had not fulfilled his political responsibility to the next generation, and from then on, he often had heart-to-heart talks with his child, studied Mao Zedong's works together, helped him raise his class consciousness, and brought him back to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line.

There were also a few parents who, because they were misled, joined the wrong faction in the class struggle, influencing their children to join the wrong faction as well. For such parents, the PLA comrades first conducted education on the struggle between the two classes, two roads, and two lines, helping them to see the situation and distinguish right from wrong. In this way, after doing a good job with the parents and bringing them back to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, they then jointly did the students' work, truly achieving results.

The PLA comrades also, based on specific situations, inspired parents of working-class origin to use their personal experiences to conduct class education for their children. Some PLA comrades, with deep class feelings, shared their own family histories, helping parents to recall their bitter pasts. Some parents immediately shared their bitter family histories with their children, repeatedly instructing them not to forget their roots and to definitely follow Chairman Mao's words, actively returning to school to participate in the campaign to return to school and make revolution. A student in Class 3, New One, hid from his parents and played outside instead of going to school. The PLA comrades inspired his mother to recall her bitter family history of oppression and exploitation in the old society and to think about the happy life after liberation. She was so moved that tears welled up in her eyes. She took the child to Chairman Mao's portrait and educated him, saying, "Father and mother are not as dear as Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao, in his old age, calls on you to return to school to make revolution, which is the greatest concern for us working people. You should definitely listen to Chairman Mao's words." The student was deeply moved and from then on went to school every day, making rapid progress.

In more than two months, the PLA comrades conducting military training at Guiyang No. 1 Middle School visited the homes of more than 60% of the students' parents, mobilizing parents to cooperate with the school in educating students to actively participate in the campaign to return to school and make revolution, achieving great results; it also promoted the school's revolutionary great alliance and the revolutionary "three-in-one" combination.

    在贵阳一中搞军训的解放军把政治思想工作做到学生家里
    发动家长共同教育学生复课闹革命
    编者按：在史无前例的无产阶级文化大革命中，广大青年学生，在阶级斗争的大风大浪中，经风雨，见世面，迅速地茁壮地成长起来。这是毛主席的无产阶级革命路线哺育青年一代的重大胜利。
    但是，家庭仍然是教育青年一代的一个阵地，家长对教育子女仍然负有很重大的责任。在当前的复课闹革命中，利用家庭这个阵地，发动家长配合学校提高学生的革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，是搞好复课闹革命的重要一环。
    怎样发动家长协助学校搞好复课闹革命？首先要用伟大的毛泽东思想来教育和发动家长。因为只有家长自己用毛泽东思想武装起来，坚定地站在毛主席的无产阶级革命路线一边，认识到复课闹革命的重大意义，才能对子女发挥身教言教的作用。 在贵阳一中搞军训的解放军同志，充分发动学生家长协助学校搞好复课闹革命。这件事抓得好，抓得对。他们的经验，值得学习。
    本报讯　在贵阳市第一中学搞军训的解放军同志，深入细致地用毛泽东思想教育和发动家长，配合学校共同教育学生提高革命性、科学性和组织纪律性，有效地保证了复课闹革命的顺利开展。
    今年三月间，贵阳市一中广大革命派师生，热烈响应伟大领袖毛主席的号召，积极回校复课闹革命。但是，有一部分学生迟迟不回学校。这是因为有的人对复课闹革命的重大意义认识不足，有的人受资产阶级反动路线的影响与其他同学严重对立，有的人感到在校外更“自由”些。已经回校的学生中，也有一部分人还不能安心坐下来，组织纪律性较差。这些情况严重地影响了复课闹革命的顺利进行。
    经过短时间的摸索，解放军同志认为，要做好这一部分学生的工作，光靠解放军同志和一些到校的革命师生是不够的，还必须把学生的家长也发动起来，共同加强对学生的教育。于是，他们采取了走访学生家长、开家长座谈会和给家长写信等办法，向学生家长做深入细致的思想政治工作。
    家长对子女能不能起到良好的教育作用，首先要看他们自己的头脑是不是用毛泽东思想武装了起来。因此，解放军同志在访问学生家长时，首先同他们共同学习毛主席著作或语录，向他们宣传毛泽东思想，宣传党的方针政策。同时，针对每个家长的具体情况，抓住活思想，做深入细致的思想政治工作。
    有的家长不重视复课闹革命，以为那是学生和教师的事，与家庭的关系不大。解放军同志就向他们反复说明，复课闹革命是伟大领袖毛主席提出的战斗号召，对于培养无产阶级革命事业接班人和搞好学校文化大革命有很重大的意义。家长们的认识提高了，便积极教育子女回校参加复课闹革命，有些家长还亲自把子女送到学校来。
    有的家长长时期对子女采取放任不管的态度，很少从政治思想上关心他们的成长，就是看到自己的子女在这次无产阶级文化大革命中犯了错误，也没有严肃地进行批评和教育。解放军同志就同这些家长共同学习毛主席的教导：“帝国主义的预言家们根据苏联发生的变化，也把‘和平演变’的希望，寄托在中国党的第三代或者第四代身上。我们一定要使帝国主义的这种预言彻底破产。我们一定要从上到下地、普遍地、经常不断地注意培养和造就革命事业的接班人。”这些家长从而认识到教育子女是关系到中国会不会“和平演变”的大事，必须对子女加强毛泽东思想的教育。新四班有个学生的家长，原来认为孩子大了，用不着大人多操心了，结果对自己的孩子在阶级斗争的大风大浪中站错了队，还不知道；听到解放军同志谈到孩子的事时，才大吃一惊。在解放军同志的帮助下，他深深感到对下一代没有从政治上尽到责任，以后就经常和孩子谈心，一起学习毛主席著作，帮助他提高阶级觉悟，使他回到了毛主席的革命路线上来。
    也有少数家长，自己因为受蒙蔽在阶级斗争中站错了队，也影响到子女站错了队。对这样的家长，解放军同志首先是向他们本人进行两个阶级、两条道路、两条路线斗争的教育，帮助他们认清形势，分清大是大非。这样，先把家长的工作做好了，使他们回到毛主席的革命路线上来，然后再共同做学生的工作，就能真正收到效果。
    解放军同志还根据具体情况，启发劳动人民出身的家长用自己的亲身经历向子女进行阶级教育。有些解放军同志还怀着深厚的阶级感情，摆自己的家史，帮助家长忆苦思甜。有的家长当场就向子女讲自己的苦难家史，一再嘱咐子女千万不能忘本，一定要听毛主席的话，积极回学校复课闹革命。新一（3）班有个学生，瞒着家长在外边玩，不去学校。解放军同志启发他的母亲回忆在旧社会受压迫受剥削的苦难家史，想到解放后的幸福生活。她激动得热泪盈眶，把孩子带到毛主席像前教育孩子说：“爹亲娘亲不如毛主席亲。毛主席他老人家叫你们回校复课闹革命，是对我们劳动人民的最大关怀。你应该好好听毛主席的话。”这个学生很受感动，以后天天到校，进步很快。
    在贵阳市一中搞军训的解放军同志，两个多月中，先后登门访问了全校百分之六十以上的学生的家长，发动家长配合学校教育学生积极复课闹革命，取得了很大的效果；对学校的革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，都起到了促进作用。
