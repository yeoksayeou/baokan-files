Burmese workers deeply admire and love Great Leader Chairman Mao. Mastering Mao Zedong Thought enables the defeat of imperialism, revisionism, and reactionaries.

According to Xinhua News Agency from Rangoon, Burmese workers on the construction sites of factories built with Chinese aid deeply love Chairman Mao and hold Mao Zedong Thought in high esteem.

Burmese workers who work with Chinese experts always enthusiastically shout "Mao Zedong! Mao Zedong!" when they meet Chinese experts on the construction sites every morning. Some workers often write the phrases "The East is Red" and "Long Live Chairman Mao!" with the Chinese characters they have just learned to express their deep feelings for Chairman Mao. They tell the Chinese experts: "Mao Zedong, good, good! Mao Zedong is not only the great leader of the Chinese people but also our great leader. Mao Zedong not only cares for the Chinese people but also cares for the working people of the world. In today's world, Mao Zedong cares most about the fate of the working people of the world."

A Burmese friend, upon receiving the long-awaited "Selected Works of Mao Zedong," excitedly pressed this revolutionary treasure to his chest and shouted: "Chairman Mao is the red sun that never sets in our hearts! Long Live Chairman Mao!" Another Burmese friend said: "I have read 'Selected Works of Mao Zedong' several times. Chairman Mao's works are revolutionary treasures. Chairman Mao has summed up the rich experience of the Chinese revolution. I love reading Chairman Mao's works the most and have benefited greatly from them."

A worker said: "China has been liberated for only seventeen years, but it has already become so strong. This is because the Chinese people have the greatest leader, Mao Zedong, and a unified ideology, the invincible Mao Zedong Thought. The people of the world, following the great revolutionary leader Mao Zedong, will have a bright future; the people of the world, mastering the great Mao Zedong Thought, will be able to defeat imperialism, revisionism, and all reactionaries, and liberate all of humanity!" Many Burmese workers, upon seeing the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging in the residence of Chinese experts, immediately stand at attention and salute Chairman Mao. They also shout: "Long Live Chairman Mao!" One of the workers earnestly said: "Please give me this portrait of Chairman Mao! I will frame it and hang it at home so I can see Chairman Mao every day!" An old worker brought his grandson to visit the Chinese experts. When he saw the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the wall, he gave a thumbs up and said: "Mao Zedong, good, very good!" He taught his grandson to shout: "Long Live Chairman Mao!" and salute Chairman Mao.

Many Burmese workers eagerly asked Chinese experts for portraits of Chairman Mao. After receiving them, they wore the portraits to work every day. A Burmese worker, upon receiving a portrait of Chairman Mao, was so moved that he shed tears. He said: "I deeply admire and love Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao is the great leader of the proletariat of the world. Wearing the portrait of Chairman Mao means that I will forever follow Chairman Mao and march forward bravely."

    缅甸劳动人民非常崇敬和爱戴伟大领袖毛主席
    掌握毛泽东思想就能战胜帝修反
    据新华社仰光电　在中国援助兴建的工厂建筑工地上的缅甸劳动人民，无限热爱毛主席，无限崇拜毛泽东思想。
    同中国专家一起工作的缅甸工人，每天早上在建筑工地上同中国专家会面时，总是热情地高呼“毛泽东！毛泽东！”有些工人常常用他们刚刚学会的汉字写下“东方红”和“毛主席万岁！”这些词句，以表达他们对毛主席的深厚感情。他们对中国专家说：“毛泽东，好，好！毛泽东不仅是中国人民的伟大领袖，也是我们的伟大领袖。毛泽东不仅关心中国人民，而且关心世界劳动人民。在当代的世界上，毛泽东最关心世界劳动人民的命运。”
    一位缅甸朋友在得到他久已盼望的《毛泽东选集》时，激动地把这部革命宝书紧紧地贴在胸口上，并且高呼：“毛主席是我们心中不落的红太阳！”“毛主席万岁！”另一位缅甸朋友说：“我已经把《毛泽东选集》读了好几遍。毛主席的著作是革命的宝书，毛主席总结了中国革命的丰富经验。我最爱读毛主席的著作，我从中受到很大的教益。”
    一位工人说：“中国解放只有十七年，但是她现在已经变得这样强大。这是因为中国人民有最伟大的领袖毛泽东，有统一的思想，即战无不胜的毛泽东思想。世界人民跟着伟大的革命领袖毛泽东，他们就将有光明的前途；世界人民掌握了伟大的毛泽东思想，他们就能战胜帝国主义、修正主义和一切反动派，解放全人类！”许多缅甸工人看到挂在中国专家住所墙上的毛主席像时，他们立刻立正并向毛主席敬礼。他们还高呼：“毛主席万岁！”其中一位工人恳切地说：“请把这张毛主席像送给我吧！我将把这张毛主席像装上镜框，挂在家里，这样我天天可以看到毛主席！”一位老工人带着他的孙子来访问中国专家。当他看到挂在墙上的毛主席像时，他翘起大拇指说：“毛泽东，好，好得很！”他教他的孙子高呼：“毛主席万岁！”并向毛主席敬礼。
    许多缅甸工人以迫不及待的心情向中国专家索取毛主席像章。当他们得到了像章后，他们每天佩戴着毛主席像章到工地去工作。有一位缅甸工人在得到一枚毛主席像章时激动得流下了眼泪。他说：“我非常崇敬和爱戴毛主席。毛主席是世界无产者的伟大领袖。我佩戴毛主席像章，这意味着我将永远跟随毛主席奋勇前进。”
