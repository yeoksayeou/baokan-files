	The reactionary Burmese government brazenly conducted an illegal inspection of our embassy's property. Our embassy strongly protests the Burmese reactionary government's infringement of our diplomatic privileges and strongly protests the Ne Win reactionary government's rude obstruction of our embassy staff's normal activities.

	New China News Agency, July 28th: Yangon News: The Chinese Embassy in Burma sent a note to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 26th, strongly protesting the Burmese reactionary government's rude violation of international customs and blatant infringement of the Chinese Embassy's diplomatic privileges, as well as its deliberate worsening of Sino-Burmese diplomatic relations. The note pointed out that the Burmese reactionary government has set up numerous obstacles in the matter of the Burmese reactionary government's illegal blockade of the Chinese Embassy in Burma, even going so far as to blatantly infringe upon the Chinese Embassy's diplomatic privileges and violate international customs. We must ask: What are the intentions of the Burmese reactionary government?

	The note strongly warned that the Burmese government must immediately change this erroneous approach and not harass or inspect the Chinese Embassy's future imports of public-use items. If the Burmese reactionary government persists in its actions, it will surely receive the punishment it deserves and will surely reap what it sows!

	The note stated that since the Burmese reactionary government instigated anti-China and anti-Chinese movements, relevant Burmese parties have taken a series of unprecedented unreasonable measures in the history of international relations, severely restricting and obstructing the normal diplomatic and administrative activities of the Embassy of the People's Republic of China in Burma, making the Embassy's situation extremely difficult.

	The note stated that in order to meet the urgent needs of the Embassy staff for living supplies, the Government of the People's Republic of China, on July 24th, used a Chinese Civil Aviation aircraft to transport 13 boxes of vegetables, fruits, and emergency medicines to the Chinese Embassy. Despite the abnormal situation created by the Burmese reactionary government, the Burmese authorities insisted that this batch of goods must be imported according to normal procedures. Nevertheless, the Embassy completed all necessary procedures on July 25th. However, when Chinese Embassy diplomatic officials arrived at Yangon Airport in the afternoon to pick up the goods, the Burmese reactionary government's customs authorities created unnecessary trouble and unreasonably demanded to inspect the Embassy's public-use items. What was even more serious was that the Burmese customs officials, despite the strong protests and firm rejections of the Chinese Embassy diplomatic personnel present, arbitrarily opened the boxes in an attempt to inspect them.

	The note pointed out that for many years, the relevant authorities of the Chinese government have consistently provided tax-free and inspection-free treatment for the public and private items imported by the Burmese Embassy in China according to the principle of diplomatic reciprocity. Now, the Burmese reactionary government, in order to arbitrarily engage in anti-China activities, has unilaterally violated this principle.

	The note solemnly pointed out that due to the Burmese reactionary government's blockade of the Chinese Embassy and unreasonable restrictions on the Embassy's diplomatic and administrative activities, the Embassy's work and the living conditions of Embassy personnel have encountered great difficulties. The Burmese reactionary government is entirely responsible for the occurrence of this situation, and the Burmese reactionary government must immediately lift the blockade and guarantee the freedom of Embassy personnel to carry out diplomatic and administrative activities.

	New China News Agency, July 28th: Yangon News: The Ne Win reactionary government once again rudely and unreasonably obstructed and interfered with the normal activities of the Chinese Embassy in Burma on the afternoon of the 27th. The Chinese Embassy submitted a strong protest to the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the same day regarding this serious incident.

	On the afternoon of the 27th, Chinese Embassy diplomatic personnel went to Yangon City to deliver invitations to the Overseas Chinese to participate in the "August 1" Military Anniversary Reception. The Chinese Embassy had previously notified the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the car numbers, departure time, and number of people entering the "military-controlled" Overseas Chinese residential areas. When the car left the Embassy, two police cars followed closely behind. When the car reached the "military-controlled area," Burmese soldiers deliberately created obstacles and unreasonably prevented Chinese diplomatic personnel from entering the "military-controlled area" for twenty minutes. At that time, many Overseas Chinese, despite the obstruction of Burmese reactionary government soldiers and plainclothes agents, came out to warmly welcome the Chinese Embassy personnel. This caused the Burmese reactionary government to panic, and they immediately dispatched many armed soldiers, police, and agents as if facing a major enemy, surrounding the Chinese diplomatic personnel. At the same time, some reactionary newspaper reporters and photographers also rushed to the scene to provoke the Chinese diplomatic personnel. A member of the Chinese Embassy immediately protested strongly to an officer on the spot. This officer even threatened the Chinese Embassy personnel to leave immediately and dispatched many soldiers to stand on the road that the Chinese Embassy car had to pass, threatening the Chinese diplomatic personnel.

	On the same afternoon, the Chinese Embassy submitted a strong protest to the Deputy Director of the Protocol Department of the Burmese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, U Kan Nyu, regarding the Burmese authorities' disregard for international diplomatic relations and their obstruction and provocation of the normal activities of Chinese diplomatic personnel.

    缅甸反动政府悍然对我使馆物品进行非法检查
    我使馆强烈抗议缅反动政府侵犯我外交特权
    并强烈抗议奈温反动政府粗暴阻挠我使馆人员进行正常活动
    新华社二十八日讯　仰光消息：中国驻缅甸大使馆二十六日照会缅甸外交部，强烈抗议缅甸反动政府粗暴地违反国际惯例，公然侵犯中国大使馆外交特权和肆意恶化中缅两国外交关系的严重罪行。照会指出，缅甸反动政府竟然在中国政府向被缅甸反动政府非法封锁的中国驻缅甸大使馆人员供应少量食物和药品问题上设置重重障碍，甚至不惜走到公然侵犯中国大使馆外交特权和违反国际惯例的地步。我们要问：你们缅甸反动政府究竟居心何在？
    照会强烈警告缅甸政府必须立即改变这一错误做法，对中国大使馆今后进口公用物品不得刁难和检查。如果缅甸反动政府一意孤行，必将受到应有的惩罚，必将自食其果！
    照会说，自从缅甸反动政府制造反华排华运动以来，缅甸有关方面采取了一系列国际关系史上罕见的无理措施，对中华人民共和国驻缅甸大使馆的正常外交和事务活动百般限制和阻挠，大使馆处境十分困难。
    照会说，中华人民共和国政府为了满足大使馆工作人员生活急需，于七月二十四日由中国民航飞机运送蔬菜、水果和急救药品十三箱给中国大使馆。不顾由缅甸反动政府一手造成的不正常局面，缅甸当局坚持此批物资必须按正常手续进口。尽管如此，大使馆于七月二十五日办理了一切必要手续。但是，当中国大使馆外交官员于当日下午抵达仰光机场提取货物时，缅甸反动政府海关当局横生枝节，竟然无理要求对大使馆公用物品进行检查。更加严重的是，缅甸海关人员不顾在场的中国大使馆外交人员的强烈抗议和断然拒绝，竟蛮横无理地动手开箱企图检查。
    照会指出，多年以来，中国政府有关当局始终根据外交互惠原则对缅甸驻华使馆进口公私物品给予免税免验的待遇。现在，缅甸反动政府为了肆意反华，竟单方面地破坏了这一原则。
    照会严正指出，目前由于缅甸反动政府封锁中国使馆，无理限制大使馆的外交和事务活动，大使馆的工作和使馆人员生活遇到很大困难。缅甸反动政府对于这种情况的出现负有完全的责任，缅甸反动政府必须立即撤除封锁，保证大使馆人员开展外交和事务活动的自由。
    新华社二十八日讯　仰光消息：奈温反动政府二十七日下午又一次粗暴无理地阻挠和干扰中国驻缅甸大使馆人员的正常活动。中国大使馆当天下午就这个严重事件向缅甸外交部提出强烈抗议。
    二十七日下午，中国大使馆外交人员前往仰光市，向华侨投送请他们参加“八·一”建军节招待会的请帖。中国大使馆事先曾将要进入“军事管制”下的华侨居住地区的汽车号码、出发时间和人数通知缅甸外交部。当这辆车子离开大使馆时，有两辆警车紧跟在后面盯梢。当汽车到了“军事管制区”的时候，缅甸军人故意刁难，无理阻止中国外交人员进入“军管区”达二十分钟之久。当时，许多华侨不顾缅甸反动政府派出的军人和便衣特务的阻止，出来热烈欢迎中国大使馆人员。这样一来，缅甸反动政府慌了手脚，又派出许多荷枪实弹的军人、警察和特务如临大敌似地把中国外交人员包围起来。同时，一些反动报纸的新闻记者和摄影记者也立即赶来向中国外交人员挑衅。一位中国大使馆的人员当场向一个军官提出强烈抗议。这个军官竟然威胁中国大使馆人员要他们立即离开那里，并且派出许多士兵站在中国大使馆的汽车要经过的路上，对中国外交人员进行威胁。
    当天下午，中国大使馆就缅甸当局不顾国际外交关系准则，对中国外交人员的正常活动进行阻挠和挑衅一事向缅甸外交部礼宾司副司长吴坎纽提出强烈抗议。
