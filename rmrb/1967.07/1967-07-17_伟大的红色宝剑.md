From the flames of the Chinese revolution and the furnace of the world revolution, a great red sword has been forged— the sword of Mao Zedong Thought. Tempered a thousand times, refined ten thousand times, it is invincible in battle, unconquerable in attack—ah, the red sword of the people. All the revolutionary people of the world, brandish your swords, smash your enemies—the imperialists, the revisionists, the reactionaries of all countries; fight for a new world without imperialism, without capitalism, without exploitation and oppression, a world of peace, prosperity, and progress. Before us, the enemy is madly and brutally counterattacking everywhere. This is a life-and-death struggle! But the outcome is clear: we will surely win. Because we have the great red sword, the sword of Mao Zedong Thought, which is invincible in battle, unconquerable in attack. Hold the sword tightly in your hand, brandish the sword, defeat the enemy, and we will achieve victory, we will win the whole world.
