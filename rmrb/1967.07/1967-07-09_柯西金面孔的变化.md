The Soviet revisionist leader Brezhnev, in a speech delivered on July 5, lavishly praised Kosygin's performance at the United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting, as if Kosygin had truly fought for the Arab people at the United Nations.

What exactly did Kosygin do at the United Nations General Assembly emergency meeting? The only thing he did was deliver a forty-minute speech. However, even this performance was lackluster. The Associated Press reported that the "business-like" Chairman of the Soviet Council of Ministers "made hardly a gesture as he read his statement to the General Assembly, then returned to his seat." The Japanese newspaper *Asahi Shimbun* described it even more vividly: Kosygin had a "cold, bureaucratic" expression, and his speech was "more of a dull recitation than a speech." He kept his head down, his hands on either end of the podium, and maintained this posture for forty minutes. "It was far from impressive." Kosygin's lackluster and disinterested demeanor fully exposed the Soviet revisionists' insincerity in supporting the Arab people, which is why a policeman on duty at the United Nations remarked, "It was like he was on paid vacation."

Kosygin indeed went to the United States "on vacation." When Kosygin returned to Moscow from the United States, Brezhnev greeted him at the airport, saying, "You had a wonderful holiday," and "You must have had a pleasant trip."

Kosygin probably couldn't disagree. Apart from that brief moment at the United Nations General Assembly, his "vacation" in the United States was indeed "wonderful" and "pleasant." Strolling along Wall Street, appreciating the short skirts of American girls, and taking an American military plane to visit the Niagara Falls—all of this was "pleasant" enough. But what was truly "wonderful" and "pleasant" was the two days he spent at the "Hollybush" house in Glassboro with the American imperialist head Johnson. It was from this point on that Kosygin's face underwent a sudden change.

When Kosygin arrived in Glassboro to meet Johnson, they hit it off immediately. Not only did they "shake hands warmly" when greeting each other, but Kosygin also "quickly congratulated" Johnson on becoming a grandfather for the first time this week, and they "laughed heartily." As the *Asahi Shimbun* reporter put it, Kosygin's face underwent a "transformation," becoming "neither cold nor bureaucratic," but rather "smiling warmly," "very sincere," "full of enthusiasm, not feigned, and with a sense of humor." "After the second meeting, Kosygin's demeanor became even more triumphant."

Kosygin's facial transformation, of course, was not just because he and Johnson had the "honor" of joining the "grandfather club" together, or because he took a family photo with Johnson's wife and children. As the *Asahi Shimbun* reporter said, "In this small college town, in a small room of the president's residence, something must have happened. Otherwise, such a smile would not have appeared."

What exactly happened? Kosygin wouldn't say. He only said, "We did not reach any new agreements." However, Kosygin's facial change completely exposed the treacherous soul of this traitor who kowtowed and flattered before the American imperialist head Johnson. What kind of dealings did such a Kosygin have with Johnson? Even if Kosygin himself doesn't confess, can the people of the world not see it?

　　柯西金面孔的变化
　　钟般
    苏修头目勃列日涅夫在五日发表的一篇讲话里，大肆吹捧柯西金在联合国大会紧急会议上的表现，似乎柯西金在联合国着实为支持阿拉伯人民奋斗了一番。
    柯西金在联合国大会紧急会议上到底干了些什么呢？他所做的唯一的一件事情，就是发表了一篇四十分钟的演说。但是，就是这么一场戏，他也演得很不象样子。美联社的记者报道说，“这位商人般的”苏联部长会议主席“在向联大宣读他的发言时，几乎没有做一个手势，然后走回他的座位”。日本《朝日新闻》的记者则描绘得更形象：柯西金摆出一副“冷冰冰的、官僚式的”面孔，他的演说“与其说是演说，不如说是无聊的朗诵。低着头，两手放在讲坛的两端，这样的姿式保持了四十分钟之久。……未免太不精采了”。柯西金这种没精打采、心不在焉的样子，充分暴露了苏修集团在支持阿拉伯人民的问题上的虚情假意，无怪乎一个在联合国担任守卫的警察说，“简直是带薪休假的样子”。
    柯西金的确是到美国“休假”去的。当柯西金从美国回到莫斯科的时候，勃列日涅夫就在飞机场上对他说，“你度过了一个美好的假期”，“你一定作了一次愉快的旅行”。
    柯西金大概不能不同意，除了在联合国大会上的那一段短暂的时间以外，他在美国的“休假”的确是“美好的”、“愉快的”。在华尔街上的漫步，对美国姑娘的短裙子的鉴赏，坐着美国的军用飞机到尼亚加拉瀑布去探幽访胜，这就够“愉快的”了。但是，真正“美好”、“愉快”的，还是他在葛拉斯堡罗的那座叫做“霍利布什”的房子里同美帝国主义头子约翰逊一起度过的两天“假期”。正是从这时候起，柯西金的面孔起了突然的变化。
    柯西金到了葛拉斯堡罗和约翰逊会面，就一见如故，不但“在问好时热烈握手”，而且“迅速地祝贺（约翰逊）总统本周第一次当上了外祖父”，“放声大笑”起来。用《朝日新闻》记者的话来说，“柯西金面孔”，发生了“突变”，“完全变了样”，变得“既不是冷冰冰的，也不是官僚式的”，而是“笑迷迷”、“非常诚恳”、“有热情，而不是装模作样的，而且是有幽默感的”。“第二次会谈以后，柯西金的神情就更洋洋得意了”。
    柯西金面孔的这种“突变”，当然不仅仅是因为他同约翰逊一起“荣幸”地加入了“外祖父俱乐部”，或者因为他同约翰逊的妻子儿女拍了一张“家庭合影”。正如《朝日新闻》的记者所说的，“在这小小的大学城里，在校长住宅的一个小小的房间里，肯定是发生了‘什么’。不然，就不会产生出那样的微笑来”。
    究竟发生了“什么”呢？柯西金不肯讲。他只说，“我们没有达成任何新的协议”。但是，柯西金的面孔的变化，就彻底暴露了这个在美帝国主义头子约翰逊面前卑躬屈节、谄笑献媚的叛徒的丑恶的灵魂。这样的一个柯西金，同约翰逊一起究竟干了些什么勾当，即使柯西金自己不交代，难道全世界人民还会看不出来吗？
