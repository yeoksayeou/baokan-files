    Chairman Mao's Quotations
    “Lifting a stone only to drop it on one's own foot,” is a Chinese saying used to describe the behavior of some foolish people. The reactionaries of all countries are exactly such a bunch of fools. The various persecutions they inflict on the revolutionary people ultimately only serve to promote a broader and more intense revolution among the people.

    Excerpt from the speech “On the 40th Anniversary of the Great October Socialist Revolution” delivered at the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union.

    毛主席语录
    “搬起石头打自己的脚”，这是中国人形容某些蠢人的行为的一句俗话。各国反动派也就是这样的一批蠢人。他们对于革命人民所作的种种迫害，归根结底，只能促进人民的更广泛更剧烈的革命。
    《在苏联最高苏维埃庆祝伟大的十月社会主义革命四十周年会议上的讲话》
