    Afterword
    The current major task facing the revolutionary students of secondary schools is to quickly achieve revolutionary unity and a revolutionary "three-in-one combination," to ensure that classes resume and the revolution proceeds, so that the Cultural Revolution in secondary schools can swiftly get back on track.

    The experience of Class 1, Grade 1 of Beijing No. 32 Middle School shows that to accomplish this major task, it is necessary to correctly handle ideological differences among classmates and between teachers and students.

    How can ideological differences be resolved? Their experience shows that it is necessary to insist on the method of persuasion and education, to do in-depth and detailed political and ideological work. This way, not only can ideological issues be clarified, but comrades can also be united. On the other hand, if coercive methods are used, not only will problems not be solved, but the ideological gap between people will only widen.

    The experience of this class is worth considering for the broad revolutionary teachers and students in secondary schools who are currently resuming classes and making revolution.

    当前，摆在中学无产阶级革命派面前的重大任务，就是要尽快地实现革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”，搞好复课闹革命，使中学无产阶级文化大革命迅速走上正轨。
    北京市三十二中初中一年级一班的经验表明，要完成这个重大任务，必须正确处理同学之间、师生之间的思想分歧。
    怎样才能消除思想分歧呢？他们的体会是：必须坚持说服教育的方法，做深入细致的政治思想工作。这样，既能弄清思想，又能团结同志。反之，如果采取压服的方法，不但解决不了问题，反而会使彼此的思想距离越来越远。
    这个班的经验，值得正在复课闹革命的中学广大革命师生参考。
