The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Hohhot Machine Tool Factory, after seizing power, firmly grasped the direction of the struggle, launched a revolutionary great criticism, and effectively promoted the great alliance of revolution, united the broad masses of cadres and the people, and promoted the development of production.

The deeper the criticism, the clearer the distinction between enemies and ourselves

The proletarian revolutionary faction of this factory has suffered from the counter-revolutionary line of the Chinese Khrushchev, deeply realizing that the total backstage of the capitalist counter-revolutionary restoration is the top capitalist-roader in the party. Without thoroughly overthrowing this top capitalist-roader and thoroughly purging his poison, the dictatorship of the proletariat cannot be consolidated. Therefore, after the proletarian revolutionary faction seized power, it immediately launched a revolutionary great criticism movement. However, in the initial stage, some comrades in the revolutionary faction lacked confidence in whether the deceived masses and cadres could return to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, and some even had a vengeful mood. Facing this situation, the revolutionary faction of this factory, while organizing everyone to study Chairman Mao's works, firmly grasped the line of revolutionary great criticism. Since May, they have mobilized the masses to concentrate their firepower on the top capitalist-roader in the party and his agents within the Inner Mongolia Party, and on a handful of counter-revolutionary revisionists in this factory. They held four large meetings and dozens of medium-sized meetings and small group meetings at the workshop level, systematically criticizing from various aspects. At the same time, they organized the deceived masses and cadres to expose the heinous crimes of this handful of bourgeois representatives in spreading white terror, sabotaging the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, and sabotaging production. The revolutionary great criticism greatly raised the consciousness of the broad masses and cadres. They said: "The top capitalist-roader in the party is the chief culprit who sabotaged the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The deeper the criticism, the more hatred we have for the bourgeois counter-revolutionary line; the more we cherish the proletarian revolutionary line represented by Chairman Mao. The deeper the criticism, the clearer our minds and eyes, the more we see who the enemy is and who the friend is."

The vast majority of cadres stand up straight

After the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution began, many cadres in this factory, because of the poisoning of "Cultivation," consciously or unconsciously stood on the side of the bourgeois counter-revolutionary line. Can these people still be trusted? The comrades of the proletarian revolutionary faction brought this question to Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said: "One must be good at identifying cadres. One must not only look at the deeds of a cadre at a particular time and on a particular occasion, but must look at the whole history and the whole work of the cadre. This is the main method of identifying cadres." They analyzed the cadres comprehensively according to this instruction. The result of the analysis was: the majority of the cadres in this factory are good or relatively good; only a handful of capitalist-roaders have infiltrated the party.

After analyzing the cadres with a class standpoint, the proletarian revolutionary faction and the broad revolutionary masses saw clearly the situation of the cadre team, further realizing that they should believe in and rely on the majority of the cadres, and strictly distinguish between the two types of different nature of contradictions. Some comrades corrected the wrong thoughts of being afraid to associate with cadres and being afraid of being called "royalists." They said: The proletarian revolutionary faction is to overthrow the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party, showing no mercy to them and resolutely overthrowing them; for cadres who have made mistakes, they follow Chairman Mao's teaching of "punishing past mistakes to prevent future ones and curing the sickness to save the patient," "one look, two helps"; for cadres who are good in principle, they resolutely support them and resolutely "protect" them.

In the revolutionary great criticism, they fiercely exposed and fiercely criticized the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party; in the struggle, they tested the cadres who had joined the wrong side, encouraging them to come out in the great criticism, expose problems, and make amends. At the same time, they required them to guard their production posts and work hard under the supervision of the masses. At the beginning, many cadres who had made mistakes had concerns, saying: "We joined the wrong side and did bad things. No one listens to us. We might as well work in the workshop." Facing this active thought, the proletarian revolutionary faction organized them to study Chairman Mao's works and did ideological and political work for them. They also explained to them: as long as they sincerely examine themselves, honestly confess, boldly expose, and sincerely return to Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line, they would support them to stand up and revolutionize. Many cadres saw that the proletarian revolutionary faction could do what they said, and thus dispelled their concerns and gradually stood up to work. After two months of revolutionary great criticism and in-depth ideological work, now the vast majority of cadres have been liberated and are actively promoting revolution and production.

With fervent enthusiasm, helping the deceived masses

After the proletarian revolutionary faction seized power, some comrades who had suffered serious persecution from the bourgeois counter-revolutionary line held a vengeful mood towards the masses who had been deceived and joined the conservative organizations, thinking that they should vent their anger, and not "strike" them a few times would be "rightist," and associating with them would be "surrendering to the bourgeois counter-revolutionary line."

To guide everyone to strictly follow Chairman Mao's instructions, the revolutionary faction, through the revolutionary great criticism, fully exposed and criticized the crimes of the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party who incited the masses to fight against the masses. A large number of facts educated the broad members of the revolutionary faction, and they realized: the broad masses who had been deceived are their class brothers, and they should not discriminate against them or take revenge on them. In the past, they were persecuted, and the masses were poisoned, and these two accounts should be settled with the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party. The true revolutionary faction should not act from personal grudges but should act from the class interests of the proletariat, and for the deceived masses, they should enthusiastically help them and unite with them to advance together. Doing so is not "rightist" or "surrender," but truly acting according to Chairman Mao's teachings. After establishing this correct view of treating the deceived masses, the revolutionary faction actively took action to do in-depth and detailed ideological work for the deceived masses. They proposed the slogan:

"Helping one deceived comrade is helping a class brother, and adding one more strength to Chairman Mao's revolutionary line."

The revolutionary faction actively worked with the deceived masses to read Chairman Mao's books, study relevant editorials in the newspapers, and participate in revolutionary great criticism activities inside and outside the factory. After each meeting, they organized the deceived masses to hold meetings to express their thoughts, share their experiences, and help them recognize their mistakes. In their daily lives, they had individual talks, visited homes, and did political and ideological work. For those who were deeply poisoned and had not yet awakened, they did not discriminate against them but presented facts, reasoned, organized debates, actively educated, and patiently waited. Through these efforts, the deceived masses gradually saw clearly who the enemy was, distinguished right from wrong, and drew a clear line with the capitalist-roaders in the party. Conservative organizations quickly disintegrated, and the broad masses flocked to the revolutionary faction.

A great situation of revolution and production

Through the revolutionary great criticism, the broad revolutionary masses of this factory further realized that the handful of capitalist-roaders in the party sabotaged production, which was a great exposure of their ugly soul that hated the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. The proletarian revolutionary faction held a rally, determined to take on the attitude of the masters of the state, most resolutely implement Chairman Mao's great instruction of "grasp revolution, promote production," and shouldered the dual burdens of revolution and production, quickly restoring production. The comrades of the revolutionary faction set an example, took the lead, worked day and night, and struggled hard. Under the active leadership of the revolutionary faction, the revolutionary and production of the entire factory showed a great situation. The overhaul workshop of this factory completed the overhaul work volume of the first to fifth months in June alone. The total assembly workshop's total assembly of machine tools in June was equivalent to 80% of the total assembly in the first to fifth months, creating the highest monthly production level in history.

    呼和浩特机床厂革命派在大批判中认真执行毛主席的指示
    分清了敌我　解放了干部  团结了群众　推动了生产
    本报讯　呼和浩特机床厂无产阶级革命派掌权以后，紧紧掌握斗争大方向，开展革命的大批判，有力地促进了革命的大联合，团结了广大干部和群众，推动了生产的发展。
    批判越深入，敌我越分明
    这个厂的无产阶级革命派曾经受过中国赫鲁晓夫炮制的资产阶级反动路线之苦，深刻地认识到，资本主义反革命复辟的总后台是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派。不彻底打倒这个总后台，不彻底肃清他的流毒，无产阶级专政就不能巩固。因此，无产阶级革命派掌权后，立即发动了一场革命的大批判运动。可是，在开始的阶段，革命派中的一些同志，对受蒙蔽的群众和干部能否回到毛主席革命路线上来，缺乏信心，甚至有人还有报复情绪。针对这种情况，这个厂的革命派一面组织大家学习毛主席著作，一面抓住革命大批判这条纲不放。五月份以来，他们发动群众，集中火力，对准党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派及其在内蒙古党内的代理人，对准本厂的一小撮反革命修正主义分子猛烈开火。他们连续开了四次大会，几十次以车间为单位的中型会和小组会，有计划地从各方面进行批判。同时组织受蒙蔽的群众和干部，揭露这一小撮资产阶级代表人物大搞白色恐怖、破坏无产阶级文化大革命和破坏生产等滔天罪行。革命的大批判大大提高了广大群众和干部的觉悟。他们说：“党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派是破坏无产阶级文化大革命的罪魁祸首。批判越深入，对资产阶级反动路线越仇恨；对以毛主席为代表的无产阶级革命路线越亲切。批判越深入，心越明，眼越亮，越看清了谁是敌人，谁是朋友。”
    绝大多数干部挺起腰来
    在无产阶级文化大革命开始以后，这个厂的不少干部因为受《修养》的毒害，自觉或不自觉地站在资产阶级反动路线一边。对这些人还能不能相信？无产阶级革命派同志带着这个问题向毛主席著作请教。毛主席说：“必须善于识别干部。不但要看干部的一时一事，而且要看干部的全部历史和全部工作，这是识别干部的主要方法。”他们根据这个指示，对干部做了全面分析。分析的结果是：本厂干部的大多数是好的和比较好的；混进党内的走资本主义道路当权派只是一小撮。
    经过用阶级观点进行具体分析，无产阶级革命派和广大革命群众看清了干部队伍的情况，进一步认识到要相信和依靠干部的大多数，要严格区分两类不同性质的矛盾。一些同志纠正了怕和干部沾边，怕别人说“保皇派”等错误思想。他们说：无产阶级革命派就是要革党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的命，对他们绝不留情，坚决打倒；对犯了错误的干部就本着毛主席关于“惩前毖后，治病救人”的教导，“一看二帮”；对大节好的干部就坚决支持，坚决“保”。
    他们在革命的大批判中，狠揭、猛批党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派；在斗争中考验站错了队的干部，鼓励他们在大批判中杀出来，揭发问题，立功补过。同时要求他们坚守生产岗位，在群众监督下努力做好工作。开始不少犯错误的干部有顾虑，他们说：“我们站错了队，做了坏事，说话没人听，干脆下车间劳动。”针对这个活思想，无产阶级革命派就组织他们学习毛主席著作，给他们做思想政治工作。并向他们说明：只要诚恳检查，老实交代，大胆揭发，真心实意地回到毛主席的无产阶级革命路线上来，就支持他们起来革命。许多干部看到无产阶级革命派说得到，做得到，也就打消了顾虑，逐步挺起腰来干。经过两个月的革命大批判和深入细致的思想工作，现在绝大多数干部都解放出来，积极抓革命促生产。
    满腔热情地帮助受蒙蔽群众
    无产阶级革命派掌权后，一些受过资产阶级反动路线严重迫害的同志，对受蒙蔽参加保守组织的群众，抱着报复情绪，认为应该出口气了，不“打”他们两下就是“右倾”，接触他们就是“向资产阶级反动路线投降”。
    为了引导大家严格遵循毛主席的指示办事，革命派通过革命的大批判充分揭发批判了党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派挑动群众斗群众的罪恶。大量事实教育了革命派广大成员，他们认识到：广大受蒙蔽的群众是自己的阶级弟兄，对他们不应该歧视，不应该报复。过去自己受迫害，他们受毒害，这两笔账都要记在党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派身上。真正的革命派不应从个人恩怨出发，而应从无产阶级的阶级利益出发，对受蒙蔽的群众，要满腔热情地帮助他们，团结他们共同前进。这样做绝不是“右倾”，不是“投降”，而是真正按照毛主席的教导办事。树立了这种对待受蒙蔽群众的正确观点以后，革命派积极行动起来向受蒙蔽的群众做深入细致的思想工作。他们提出的口号是：
  “作好一个受蒙蔽群众的工作，就是帮助了一个阶级弟兄，就是给毛主席的革命路线增加了一分力量。”
    革命派主动和受蒙蔽的群众一起读毛主席的书，学习报纸上的有关社论，跟他们一起参加厂内外的革命大批判活动。每次会后还组织受蒙蔽的群众开会座谈，亮思想，谈心得，帮助他们认识错误。平时和他们个别谈心、深入到户做家庭访问，做政治思想工作。对于中毒较深，一时还不觉悟的群众，也不加歧视，而是摆事实，讲道理，组织辩论，积极教育，耐心等待。通过这些工作，使受蒙蔽的群众逐步认清了敌我，分清了是非，和党内走资本主义道路当权派划清了界限。保守组织迅速分化瓦解，广大群众纷纷向革命派靠拢。
    革命和生产一派大好形势
    通过革命的大批判，这个工厂的广大革命群众进一步认识到，党内一小撮走资本主义道路当权派破坏生产，是他们仇视无产阶级文化大革命的丑恶灵魂的大暴露。无产阶级革命派召开了誓师大会，决心以国家主人翁的姿态，最坚决地贯彻执行毛主席提出的
  “抓革命，促生产”的伟大指示，挑起了革命、生产两副重担，把生产迅速恢复起来。革命派的同志以身作则，一马当先，夜以继日，艰苦奋战。在革命派的积极带动下，全厂广大革命职工意气风发，革命、生产出现一派大好形势。这个厂大修车间，六月份一个月就完成了一至五月份五个月的大修工作量，总装车间六月份一个月总装机床的数量，相当于一至五月份五个月总装台数的百分之八十，创造了历年月产量的最高水平。
