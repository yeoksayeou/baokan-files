The Moscow Pawnshop Management Office recently placed large advertisements in the newspapers to attract business for the various pawnshops it operates. They offer telephone consultations, flexible terms, home visits for appraisals, and fair pricing. Indeed, their service is thorough and convenient.

When large and small enterprises in the Soviet Union are all operating on the principle of "profit first" and vying to make money, it is no surprise that Moscow's pawnshops are also expanding their operations and seeking new revenue streams.

Pawnshops are establishments where people can pawn items. Regardless of the color of their sign or the side businesses they run, their primary business is lending money at interest. In other words, they are in the business of exploiting the poor. As the saying goes, "All crows are black," and Soviet pawnshops are no exception. The privileged class with full bellies has no need for them, but only those laborers who rely on a few dozen rubles of monthly wages to make a living are forced to pay tribute to them.

The Soviet revisionist clique boasts that they have "fully launched the construction of a communist society." However, how can pawnshops coexist with communism? Marx also discussed pawnshops, stating that they are a testament to the impoverishment of the working class through the pawn tickets in their hands. It has never been heard that the development of the pawn industry is a sign of the transition to communism, where workers can enter a communist society with a pile of pawn tickets.

The grand plans of Moscow's pawnshops reflect the Soviet revisionist clique's acceleration of the restoration and development of the exploitation system and the intensification of class divisions. This is a sign of the full restoration of capitalism by the Soviet revisionists in the Soviet Union. The Soviet revisionists' hired scholars like Liberman always deny the restoration of capitalism in the Soviet Union by claiming that there are no stock exchanges. This, of course, is untenable. In such a disguised capitalist country as the Soviet Union, the bourgeoisie can still engage in exploitation and trade whether or not there are stock exchanges. However, since pawnshops are already thriving today in the Soviet Union, it would not be surprising if one day advertisements for the official opening of a stock exchange appeared in Soviet newspapers.

### 莫斯科的当铺

　　莫斯科的当铺
    莫斯科当铺管理处最近在报上大登广告，为它所经营的各家当铺招揽生意。电话接洽，当期随意，上门看货，估价公平。真是堪称服务周到，大行方便。
    当苏联的大大小小企业都本着“利润挂帅”的原则而竞相设法赚钱的时候，莫斯科的当铺当然也不甘落后。它们扩充营业，广开财源，这有什么奇怪呢？
    当铺者，典当之店铺也。不论它挂的是什么颜色的招牌，也不论它兼营什么样的副业，主要干的乃是放债吃利钱的营生。换句话说，它是一种盘剥穷人的行当。天下乌鸦一般黑，苏联的当铺，也不可能例外。脑满肠肥的特权阶层是与它无缘的，只有那些每个月依靠几十个卢布工资收入糊口的劳动者才不得不向它纳贡。
    苏修集团大吹大擂他们已经“全面展开共产主义社会建设”。但是，当铺同共产主义怎么能连得到一起呢？马克思也谈到过当铺的，那就是以工人手中的当票来证明劳动人民的贫困化。从来没有听说过，典当业的发展竟是向共产主义过渡的一个标志，工人可以带着大叠的当票进入共产主义社会。
    莫斯科当铺的大展鸿图，反映出了苏修集团正在加速恢复和发展剥削制度，加剧阶级分化。这是苏修集团在苏联全面复辟资本主义的一个标志。苏修的御用学者利别尔曼之流，总是以在苏联没有交易所来否认资本主义在苏联复辟，这当然是站不住脚的。在苏联这样变相的资本主义国家中，有没有交易所，资产阶级也一样可以搞剥削，做买卖。不过，既然今天在苏联当铺已经大行其道，那末有一天在苏联报纸上出现交易所宣告正式开张的广告，人们也不会感到奇怪的。
