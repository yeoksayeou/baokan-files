	Be Pioneers of Revolutionary Great Unity, Not Backers of "Civil War"

	Editor's Note: The following letter proposes a clear slogan: "Be Pioneers of Revolutionary Great Unity, Not Backers of 'Civil War'!" This slogan is excellent! It is not only suitable for worker revolutionary organizations but also for all revolutionary organizations.

	Our great leader Chairman Mao has highly praised our working class, saying it is "the most far-sighted and selfless." We, the working class, should live up to this high praise from our great leader and be models of being "the most far-sighted and selfless" in the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution. All true proletarian revolutionaries should be such models.

	The current primary task is to concentrate our efforts on criticizing the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party. Through this criticism, we should promote revolutionary great unity and the three-in-one combination, and drive forward the struggle, criticism, and transformation in our units. This is the major direction of the current struggle. This is the greatest "public interest." All revolutionary organizations should firmly grasp this major direction of the struggle, not be blinded by personal interests, not be provoked by others, resolutely not engage in "civil war" themselves, nor intervene in the "civil war" of other organizations, and unite all revolutionary organizations to jointly fight against the enemy.

	Editorial Comrades:

	We are employees of the Chengdu Railway Bureau in Sichuan. We see that the situation of the Cultural Revolution in the Chengdu area is excellent, and Chairman Mao's proletarian revolutionary line is achieving victory. However, there are also some abnormal phenomena that need attention. This is that some revolutionary organizations do not focus on the major direction and have not deeply criticized the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, but are busy engaging in "civil war" among revolutionary organizations. Some worker revolutionary organizations have put forward slogans like "sworn to be the backers of a certain organization," participating in the "civil war" of other units.

	According to our understanding, some comrades in worker revolutionary organizations also realize that they should not engage in "civil war," but they have a "gratitude" mentality, thinking: "They supported us in the past and shared hardships with us. Now they need our help, we cannot be ungrateful and abandon them after they have helped us."

	This "loyalty" and "gratitude" mentality is a feudal guild mentality, which is really not in line with the communist consciousness that our working class should have. We workers cannot talk about "gratitude" or "loyalty," we can only talk about revolutionary principles. Our highest principle is Mao Zedong Thought. Whatever Chairman Mao says, we should do. Currently, Chairman Mao wants us to criticize and struggle against the handful of power-holders taking the capitalist road within the Party, and promote revolutionary great unity in this criticism and struggle. This is the highest principle to test our words and deeds. Therefore, we should be pioneers in promoting revolutionary great unity and not be backers of "civil war." We should resolutely not say anything that is not conducive to great unity and resolutely not do anything that is not conducive to great unity.

	Other revolutionary organizations have shared hardships with us and supported us, and of course, we should also support them. However, we should only support their revolutionary actions and never support their actions that are not conducive to the revolution. When other revolutionary organizations are opposing and attacking each other, we, the working class, should not support one organization against another, fomenting "civil war," and fostering various non-proletarian thoughts. Instead, we should use the communist style of the working class to oppose factionalism and cliquism, use the high organizational discipline of the working class to oppose anarchism, and use the revolutionary great unity actions of the working class to promote revolutionary great unity among other revolutionary organizations. This is the true love and support for other revolutionary organizations.

	We, the working class, must not forget that we are the leading class of the revolution, we are the main force of the Cultural Revolution, and we must closely follow Mao Zedong Thought and firmly grasp the major direction of the struggle.

### 作革命大联合的先锋  不作打“内战”的后盾

　　作革命大联合的先锋  不作打“内战”的后盾
    编者按：下面这封来信提出了一个鲜明的口号：“作革命大联合的先锋，不作打‘内战’的后盾！”这个口号提得好！它不仅适合于工人革命组织，也适合于一切革命组织。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席，曾经对我们工人阶级作了高度评价，认为它“最有远见，大公无私”。我们工人阶级应该无愧于伟大领袖这一高度评价，在无产阶级文化大革命中，做“最有远见，大公无私”的模范。一切真正的无产阶级革命派，都应当做这样的模范。
    集中力量开展对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派的大批判，在大批判中促进革命的大联合和革命的三结合，推动本单位的斗批改，这是当前首要的战斗任务，也是当前斗争的大方向。这是最大的“公”。所有革命组织，应该紧紧掌握这个斗争的大方向，不为自己的私心所蒙，不为别人的挑衅所动，自己坚决不打“内战”，也不介入别的组织的“内战”，团结一切革命组织，共同对敌。
　　编辑同志：
    我们是四川成都铁路局的职工。我们看到，目前成都地区文化大革命的形势大好，毛主席的无产阶级革命路线正在取得胜利。但是，也有一些不正常现象，应当引起注意。这就是有些革命组织不抓大方向、没有对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路当权派进行深入的批判，却忙于在革命组织之间打“内战”。一些工人革命组织，提出了“誓作某某组织的后盾”之类的口号，参与了其他单位的“内战”。
    据我们了解，有些工人革命组织的同志，也认识到不该打“内战”，但他们头脑里有一种“报恩”思想，觉得：“人家过去支持过我们，和我们共过患难，现在他们需要我们帮忙了，我们不能过河拆桥，不能忘恩负义。”
    这种“讲义气”。“讲报恩”的思想，是封建行会思想，同我们工人阶级应有的共产主义觉悟实在不相称。我们工人阶级不能讲什么“报恩”，讲什么“义气”，只能讲革命原则，我们的最高原则就是毛泽东思想。毛主席怎么说，我们就应当怎么做。当前，毛主席要我们对党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派开展大批判、大斗争，在大批判、大斗争中促进革命的大联合，这就是检验我们言行的最高原则。因此，我们要作促进革命大联合的先锋，不作打“内战”的后盾。一切不利于大联合的话坚决不说，一切不利于大联合的事坚决不做。
    其他革命组织曾经和我们共过患难，支持过我们，我们当然也应该支持他们。但是我们只应该支持他们的革命行动，决不应该支持他们不利于革命的行动。当着其他革命组织，相互对立、相互攻击的时候，我们工人阶级决不应该支持一个组织反对另一个组织，助长打“内战”，助长各种非无产阶级思想的发展，而应当以工人阶级的共产主义风格去反对山头主义、小团体主义，以工人阶级的高度组织性和纪律性，去反对无政府主义，以工人阶级的革命大联合的行动去促进其他革命组织之间的革命大联合，这才是对其他革命组织的真正爱护，真正支持。
    我们工人阶级千万不要忘记我们是革命的领导阶级，我们是文化大革命的一支主力军，千万要紧跟毛泽东思想，牢牢掌握斗争的大方向。
