The Ne Win reactionary government, disregarding the prior warning from the Chinese government, has unreasonably harassed the Chinese government's shipment of relief supplies to Yangon to aid the persecuted Chinese nationals. On the 25th, the responsible official from the First Asian Affairs Bureau of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs, during a meeting with U Maung Maung Kyi, the Counselor of the Myanmar Embassy in China, lodged the strongest protest against the unreasonable harassment by the Myanmar government. It was emphasized that the Chinese government will proceed with the shipment of relief supplies according to the planned schedule.

On the 25th, U Maung Maung Kyi, the Counselor of the Myanmar Embassy in China, requested a meeting with the responsible official from the First Asian Affairs Bureau of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs and handed over a note in response to the Chinese government's decision. The note stated that the Myanmar government "in principle does not allow foreign governments and their agencies to import any items for use by their nationals," and therefore cannot agree to China's shipment of relief supplies to aid Chinese nationals.

The responsible official from the First Asian Affairs Bureau of our Ministry of Foreign Affairs immediately lodged the strongest protest against the unreasonable harassment by the Myanmar government. It was sternly pointed out that the Myanmar government, which has perpetrated the fascist atrocities of mass murder and persecution of Chinese nationals, has not yet settled this blood debt. Now, it is again unreasonably obstructing the Chinese government's shipment of relief supplies to Yangon to aid the persecuted Chinese nationals, thereby once again exposing the fascist reactionary face of the Myanmar government.

The official pointed out that the Chinese government has the full right to protect and aid the Chinese nationals in Myanmar who have been harmed. The note from the Myanmar government did not provide any reason for refusing the shipment of relief supplies from China. This is because the obstruction by the Myanmar government is entirely unreasonable. The Chinese nationals in Myanmar are suffering cruel persecution at the hands of the Myanmar government, and are in dire straits. The Chinese government's shipment of supplies to aid them is entirely justified and reasonable. Any government that respects the rights of foreign governments to protect their nationals and adheres to the most basic principles of international relations would have no reason to reject such an arrangement.

The official pointed out that after brutally murdering and persecuting Chinese nationals, the Myanmar government has tried to cover up its crimes by feigning innocence and using propaganda machines in every possible way. However, let me tell you frankly: the Ne Win government's heinous crimes against the Chinese people are not something it can escape from. Now, you are unreasonably harassing the Chinese government's shipment of relief supplies, proving that your persecution of the broad masses of Chinese nationals is becoming even more severe, exposing your grand conspiracy to put the broad masses of Chinese nationals to death. This is something that the Chinese government and the Chinese people absolutely cannot tolerate.

The official emphasized that the Chinese government's decision to ship relief supplies to Yangon to aid Chinese nationals expresses the deep concern of 700 million Chinese people for their fellow countrymen. The Chinese government will proceed with the shipment of relief supplies according to the planned schedule. If the Myanmar government continues to harass, it will only add to its crimes and face strong condemnation from the Chinese people and people around the world.

    我外交部最强烈抗议奈温反动政府的无理刁难
    中国政府决定运送物品去缅甸救济华侨
    警告缅甸反动政府如继续一意孤行只能罪上加罪
    新华社二十六日讯　奈温反动政府不顾中国政府的事先警告，竟然无理刁难中国政府运送救济物品去仰光救济受迫害的华侨。我外交部第一亚洲司负责人二十五日在接见缅甸驻华大使馆参赞吴貌貌基时，对缅甸政府的这种无理刁难提出最强烈的抗议，并且强调指出，中国政府将按照既定计划运送救济物品。
    缅甸驻华大使馆参赞吴貌貌基二十五日约见我国外交部第一亚洲司负责人时，递交了一份答复中国政府的决定的照会，照会说：缅甸政府
  “原则上不准许外国政府和它们的机构进口任何供其侨民使用的物品”，因此不能同意中国运送物品救济华侨。
    我外交部第一亚洲司负责人当场对缅甸政府的无理刁难提出最强烈的抗议。并严正指出，缅甸政府一手制造了疯狂屠杀和迫害华侨的法西斯暴行，这笔血债还没有清算，现在又无理阻挠中国政府运送救济物品去仰光救济受迫害的华侨，这就再一次暴露了缅甸政府的法西斯反动面目。
    第一亚洲司负责人指出，中国政府完全有权保护并救济在缅甸的受害华侨。缅甸政府在照会中没有说明拒绝中国运送救济物品的任何理由。这是因为，缅甸政府的阻挠是毫无道理的。缅甸的华侨受到缅甸政府的残酷迫害，处于水深火热之中，中国政府运送物品去救济，是完全正当合理的。任何国家的政府，只要尊重外国政府保护侨民的权利，还讲一点最起码的国际关系准则，都没有理由拒绝这样的安排。
    第一亚洲司负责人指出，缅甸政府在残酷屠杀迫害华侨后，曾经装出一副伪善的面孔，开动宣传机器千方百计为自己的罪行开脱。但是老实告诉你们：奈温政府对中国人民所犯的滔天罪行，是逃脱不了其罪责的。现在，你们毫无理由地刁难中国政府运送救济物品，证明你们对广大华侨的迫害还在变本加厉，暴露了你们把广大华侨置于死地的大阴谋。这是中国政府和中国人民绝对不能容忍的。
    第一亚洲司负责人强调指出，中国政府决定运送救济物品去仰光救济华侨，这表达了七亿中国人民对自己同胞的深切关怀。中国政府将按照既定计划运送救济物品。如果缅甸政府还要继续刁难，那只能使你们罪上加罪，受到中国人民和全世界人民的强烈谴责。
