	Under the guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, we are pioneers of educational revolution.
	Comrade Chen Boda attended and spoke at the meeting. Many schools made joint speeches, pointing out that resuming classes and making revolution is an important measure to combine the great criticism of the revolution with the struggle, criticism, and reform of the school. It will strongly promote the great unity of the revolution and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination."

	Xinhua News Agency, July 11th — Today, the Capital Universities and Colleges Red Guards Association hosted a grand rally to swear to resume classes and make revolution. The meeting was filled with a fighting and united atmosphere. Over 30,000 revolutionary teachers and students from more than fifty higher education institutions attended, each brimming with spirit and fighting enthusiasm. They expressed their determination to immediately launch a high tide of resuming classes and making revolution, to be pioneers of educational revolution under the brilliant guidance of Mao Zedong Thought, and to be the vanguard in creating a brand-new proletarian educational system in human history.

	This meeting was held in the midst of a great situation where the capital's universities and colleges were launching a high tide of resuming classes and making revolution. After the news of Beijing Aviation Institute resuming classes and making revolution was broadcast, the revolutionary teachers and students of the capital's universities and colleges responded enthusiastically. Within a few days, seven schools began full-scale resuming classes and making revolution; some schools that had not yet achieved full-school revolutionary unity were also hot and enthusiastic, with broad revolutionary teachers and students strongly demanding to quickly achieve revolutionary unity and resume classes and make revolution by class. They are determined to follow Chairman Mao's teachings, to carry forward the spirit of daring to practice, daring to explore, and daring to create, to practice, summarize, and improve as they go, and to contribute to the cause of resuming classes and making revolution.

	Beijing University, Beijing Aviation Institute, Beijing Geological Institute, Beijing Normal University, Beijing Post and Telecommunications Institute, Beijing Institute of Political Science and Law, Beijing Institute of Mining and Technology, Beijing Forestry University, Beijing Workers', Peasants', and Soldiers' Institute of Physical Education, Beijing Agricultural University, China Medical University, Institute of International Relations, Institute of Diplomacy, Beijing Drama Academy, and the Art Department of Overseas Chinese University, fifteen schools that have established revolutionary committees or revolutionary committees, made joint speeches at the meeting; revolutionary organizations from Peking University, Beijing Normal College, Beijing Light Industry Institute, and Beijing Second Medical College, which are actively working towards full-school revolutionary unity, also made joint speeches.

	They said in their speeches: Resuming classes and making revolution is an important measure to combine the great criticism of the revolution with the struggle, criticism, and reform of the school; it is an important guarantee to strengthen the revolutionary nature, scientific nature, and organizational discipline of revolutionary teachers and students, and to establish a new revolutionary order. It will strongly promote the great unity of the revolution and the revolutionary "three-in-one combination." Resuming classes and making revolution is the current direction of struggle for the broad revolutionary teachers and students of universities and colleges, and it is a big deal related to whether the proletarian cultural revolution of universities and colleges can be carried out to the end. Broad revolutionary teachers and students must firmly grasp this direction. To do well in resuming classes and making revolution, we must thoroughly break down private interests and establish public interests, and resolutely overcome the personalism, anarchism, sectarianism, regionalism, small-groupism, and other non-proletarian thoughts that exist in our ranks. These bad things are not only obstacles to the great unity of the proletarian revolutionary forces but also obstacles to our resumption of classes and making revolution. The proletarian revolutionary forces should put the revolutionary cause first, seek common ground while reserving differences, achieve revolutionary unity, and resume classes and make revolution.

	They believe that resuming classes and making revolution, first of all, must teach Mao Zedong Thought well, teach the great criticism of the revolution well, and practice the basic skills of struggle, criticism, and reform. Resuming classes and making revolution must hold high the great red banner of Mao Zedong Thought, take Chairman Mao's "May 7th Directive" as the highest guideline, carry forward the revolutionary spirit of the proletarian rebellion, thoroughly criticize the counter-revolutionary revisionist educational line, thoroughly smash the old educational system, thoroughly reform the old teaching policies and methods, and strive to implement Chairman Mao's educational line and create a brand-new proletarian educational system in human history.

	They said, we are walking a path that no one has walked before. We will follow Chairman Mao's teachings, dare to practice, dare to innovate, learn to swim while swimming, and learn revolution while in revolutionary struggle. We must be the vanguard of the new educational system and the explorers of the new path. No matter how great the difficulties, they will not scare away the Red Guards of Chairman Mao. Victory will definitely belong to us, belong to the invincible Mao Zedong Thought.

	Comrade Chen Boda attended and spoke at the meeting.

	Attending today's meeting were also leaders from various sectors and the Beijing Municipal Revolutionary Committee, including Fu Chongbi, Nie Yuanzi, Li Zhongqi, Ding Guoyi, Kuang Dafu, and Han Aijing.

    首都五十多所高等院校革命师生举行复课闹革命誓师大会
    在毛泽东思想指导下做教育革命的探索者
    陈伯达同志到会讲了话。许多学校的联合发言指出，复课闹革命是把革命的大批判同本院校的斗批改结合起来的重要措施，将有力地推动革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”
    新华社十一日讯　首都大专院校红代会今天主持召开了规模盛大的首都大专院校复课闹革命誓师大会。大会充满了战斗的、团结的气氛。出席大会的五十多所高等院校三万多革命师生，人人意气风发，斗志昂扬。他们表示要立即掀起一个复课闹革命的高潮，在光辉的毛泽东思想指导下，做教育革命的探索者，做创造人类历史上崭新的无产阶级教育制度的开路先锋。
    这个大会是在首都大专院校掀起复课闹革命高潮的大好形势下召开的。北京航空学院复课闹革命的消息广播以后，首都大专院校的广大革命师生闻风而动，几天之内就有七所院校开始了全校性的复课闹革命；一些尚未实现全校革命大联合的院校也热气腾腾，广大革命师生强烈要求迅速实现革命的大联合，以教学班为单位，复课闹革命。他们决心遵循毛主席的教导，发扬敢于实践、敢于探索、敢于创造的精神，边实践，边总结，边改进，为复课闹革命作出贡献。
    北京大学、北京航空学院、北京地质学院、北京师范大学、北京邮电学院、北京政法学院、北京矿业学院、北京林业学院、北京工农兵体育学院、北京农业大学、中国医科大学、国际关系学院、外交学院、北京戏曲专科学校、华侨大学艺术系等十五所已经成立了革命委员会或者成立了校文革的学校，在会上作了联合发言；正在积极实现全校革命大联合的中国人民大学、北京师范学院、北京轻工业学院、北京第二医学院的革命组织也作了联合发言。
    他们在发言中说：复课闹革命，是把革命的大批判同本院校的斗批改结合起来的重要措施；是加强革命师生革命性、科学性、组织纪律性，建立革命新秩序的重要保证，它将有力地推动革命的大联合和革命的“三结合”。复课闹革命是大专院校广大革命师生当前的斗争大方向，是关系到能不能把大专院校的无产阶级文化大革命进行到底的大事。广大革命师生一定要牢牢把握这个大方向。要搞好复课闹革命，必须彻底破私立公，坚决克服我们队伍中存在的个人主义、无政府主义、宗派主义、山头主义、小团体主义以及其他种种非无产阶级思想。这些坏东西，不仅是无产阶级革命派大联合的障碍，也是我们复课闹革命的障碍。无产阶级革命派，应该以革命的大局为重，求大同存小异，实现革命的大联合，进行复课闹革命。
    他们认为，复课闹革命，首先要上好毛泽东思想的课，上好革命的大批判的课，练好斗、批、改的基本功。复课闹革命，必须高举毛泽东思想伟大红旗，以毛主席的“五·七”指示为最高纲领，发扬无产阶级的革命造反精神，彻底批判反革命修正主义教育路线，彻底砸烂旧的教育制度，彻底改革旧的教学方针和教学方法，为贯彻毛主席的教育路线，创造人类历史上崭新的无产阶级的教育制度而奋斗。
    他们说，我们走的是前人没有走过的路。我们要遵循毛主席的教导，敢于实践，敢于创新，在游泳中学会游泳，在革命斗争中学会革命。我们一定要做新教育制度的开路先锋，做新道路的探索者。困难再大，也吓不倒我们毛主席的红卫兵，胜利一定属于我们，属于战无不胜的毛泽东思想。
    陈伯达同志出席了大会，也讲了话。
    出席今天大会的还有各方面和北京市革命委员会的负责人傅崇碧、聂元梓、李钟奇、丁国钰、蒯大富、韩爱晶等。
