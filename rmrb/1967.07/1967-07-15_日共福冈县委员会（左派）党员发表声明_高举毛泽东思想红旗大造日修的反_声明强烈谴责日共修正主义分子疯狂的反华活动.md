Members of the Fukuoka Prefectural Committee of the Japanese Communist Party (Left Faction) Issue a Statement
Raise the Red Flag of Mao Zedong Thought to Resist the Revisionists
Statement Strongly Condemns the Japanese Communist Party Revisionists' Frenzied Anti-China Activities

New China News Agency, July 13th - According to a report from the East Asia News Agency: Approximately one hundred members of the Japanese Communist Party Fukuoka Prefectural Committee, led by the committee, issued a statement on the 7th, declaring their resolute opposition to the Japanese Communist Party revisionists and their determination to advance under the great red flag of Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought.

These members have established the Japanese Communist Party Fukuoka Prefectural Committee (Left Faction).

The statement, in exposing the betrayal of the Japanese Communist Party revisionists, emphasizes that they have betrayed the fundamental interests of the working class, disrupted and hindered the struggles of the broad masses of the people. They advocate chauvinism in the service of aggression, betraying the revolutionary cause of Japan.

The statement condemns the Japanese Communist Party revisionists for being infatuated with bourgeois democracy and eager for the bourgeois parliament.

The statement also exposes the Japanese Communist Party revisionists' cooperation and unity with the Soviet revisionist leadership, which capitulates to imperialism internationally and restores capitalism domestically.

The statement strongly condemns the Japanese Communist Party revisionists' frenzied anti-China activities.

The statement expresses the determination to resolutely eliminate the influence of "Self-Cultivation," to get rid of the erroneous line of blind obedience and slavishness.

The statement expresses the resolve to fight for the restoration of Sino-Japanese relations and the abolition of the U.S.-Japan "Security Treaty," and to firmly oppose U.S. aggression in Vietnam and demand the withdrawal of U.S. military bases from Japan.

The statement says: "We will advance along the path of opposing U.S. imperialism, Japanese militarism, and modern revisionism, and unite with the people of China, Vietnam, and other Asian countries."

The statement concludes with the slogans: "Long live the Japanese Communist Party Fukuoka Prefectural Committee (Left Faction) armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!" "Hail to the communists across Japan armed with Marxism-Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought!" "Long live the anti-imperialist and anti-revisionist unity of the proletariat worldwide!"
