During the Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution, as the attack on the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party is launched, the reactionary film "Two Families" has been exposed. The cadres and commune members of Jincheng Commune, Jinning County, Yunnan Province, are filled with indignation and severely denounce the anti-Party, anti-socialist, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought crimes of the film's directors and their biggest backer—the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party.

Jiao Zhengguo (former director of the Agricultural Cooperative of Xiaozhai Township, now a Party branch committee member): In 1963, the directors of the film "Two Families" came to our place to shoot a movie. They even specially filmed a few scenes of me. At that time, I was very happy, thinking, "With Chairman Mao leading us, we poor people have stood up. Not only do we often watch movies, but we can also be in a movie." Little did I know that the film, instead of showing our poor and lower-middle peasants' boundless love for Chairman Mao and socialism, actually defames us. The "old poor peasant" Gao Zhengguo in the film is not a poor peasant at all but a die-hard opponent of socialism. He hears that surplus grain is to be sold and fiercely resists it; he hears that a cooperative is to be established and worries so much that he can't eat or sleep; to get rich and pursue the capitalist road, he drives someone to jump into a well and commit suicide. How could a poor peasant do such things? It's completely what landlords and rich peasants do. The directors of the film fabricate such a fake poor peasant to advocate individual farming, aiming to prepare public opinion for the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party to restore capitalism in China's countryside.

We poor and lower-middle peasants deeply understand from our own experiences: who is our friend, who is our enemy, which road is the broad highway, and which road is the precipice. Before liberation, I worked for the landlord, lacking clothes and food, and couldn't make a living. After liberation, Chairman Mao led us to stand up, and our lives became sweeter and sweeter. I am deeply grateful to the great leader Chairman Mao from the bottom of my heart. Wherever Chairman Mao points, I will rush there. I will follow Chairman Mao for the rest of my life. The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party dreams of restoring capitalism and wants to lead us back to the dark old society. This is just a pipe dream!

Li Jiaqiang (former member of the mutual aid team, now chairman of the poor peasants' association of the production brigade): The film "Two Families" tries every means to beautify capitalism, portraying individual farming as very good and depicting us poor and lower-middle peasants who take the cooperative path as having little to eat and wear. Even the mutual aid team leader has to borrow grain and beg for rice from Gao Zhengguo, who practices individual farming. This is a gross distortion. In 1953, when our Xiaozhai cooperative was established, we encountered a severe drought. If it were before liberation, who knows how many people would have left their hometowns, families broken, and wives and children separated. However, relying on the cooperative, we overcame the drought and achieved a good harvest. When selling surplus grain, our small cooperative of fifteen households sold more than 12,000 catties at once, exceeding the quota by more than 2,000 catties. I want to ask those counter-revolutionary revisionists: when have you seen our organized poor and lower-middle peasants lacking grain and clothes, begging for a grain of rice from the individual farming landlords and rich peasants? Through Gao Zhengguo's mouth, you speak the words of landlords and rich peasants; through Gao Zhengguo's hands, you do the deeds of landlords and rich peasants; through this fake poor peasant, you attack the Party and oppose agricultural cooperation. We poor and lower-middle peasants see your evil intentions clearly.

Li Zhengying (former deputy leader of the mutual aid team, now production team leader): The film "Two Families" is a poisoned arrow shot at socialism. In 1952, we poor and lower-middle peasants responded to the great call of the great leader Chairman Mao for agricultural cooperation and established production cooperatives, credit cooperatives, and consumption cooperatives in the countryside. This was a heavy blow to the "four freedoms" thrown by the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party. Later, the cooperatives developed rapidly, and in 1958, the people's communes were realized. We deeply feel that farmers organizing and taking the socialist path is good. We also composed a folk song: "Individual farming is like a single plank bridge, with a trembling heart and weak legs swaying in the wind; the agricultural cooperative is like a big stone bridge, unshakable in strong winds and waves; the people's commune is like a big iron bridge, with ten-thousand-ton trains running forward." However, "Two Families" turns black into white, claiming that individual farming is better than organizing, openly attacking the socialist system, and attempting to restore capitalism. This will not happen, and it will never happen.

Li Fengyi (former leader of the mutual aid team of Xiaozhai Township, cooperative leader, and Party branch secretary): The film "Two Families," following the black directives of the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party, openly praises individual farming as good, attempting to lead us poor and lower-middle peasants onto the capitalist wrong path. This is a futile attempt. We poor and lower-middle peasants listen to Chairman Mao's words the most and are most willing to take the socialist path. In early 1952, the poor and lower-middle peasants of Xiaozhai wrote a letter to the great leader Chairman Mao, expressing our determination to take the mutual aid and cooperation path. Chairman Mao instructed the Party Central Committee's Office to reply to us, encouraging our enthusiasm for the socialist path. Chairman Mao's care gave us the greatest encouragement. We established the first mutual aid team in the province and then, according to everyone's request, established an agricultural production cooperative. Poor and lower-middle peasants say: "Mutual aid is better than individual farming, the cooperative is better than mutual aid, and we must join the cooperative." The history of the agricultural cooperation movement in Xiaozhai Township proves that the broad poor and lower-middle peasants strongly support socialism. This gives the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party a resounding slap in the face: what "three freedoms and one contract," what individual farming, what "long-term protection of the rich peasants' economy," all are nonsense!

Li Minfen (former member of the mutual aid team) and Yang Shurong (deputy secretary of the Jincheng Commune Party Committee): During the three years of difficulty, the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party shouted about "three freedoms and one contract," spreading the "individual farming wind." The landlords and rich peasants here heard this and clapped their hands in approval, saying things like: "Fields return to the family, cattle return to the owner, each farms for themselves," attempting a counterattack. At this time, the reactionary film "Two Families" emerged. The directors of the film, through Gao Zhengguo's mouth, openly advocated the reactionary fallacies of the exploiting class: "Pigs push forward, chickens scratch backward, each has their own path" and "the world will always have the poor and the rich." These people think the same and sing the same tune, aiming to restore capitalism. The biggest capitalist-roader in the Party and the ghosts and snakes: your plot to restore capitalism in China will never succeed.

Ye Yongchang (Party branch secretary of Xiaozhai Production Brigade) and Jiang Fengxian (former member of the mutual aid team, now the women's director of the production brigade): We poor and lower-middle peasants hate capitalism the most and love socialism the most. Before liberation, in Xiaozhai Township, 158 households rented land from landlords, and after paying rent each year, the remaining grain was only enough to eat for two months, making life very miserable. After liberation, with Chairman Mao leading us, we overthrew the landlords, became masters of our own homes, and took the cooperative path. Over the past ten years, we have followed the socialist bright path indicated by the Party, and it has become brighter and brighter. We have built reservoirs and installed various water pumps and internal combustion engines, completely changing the past days of relying on heaven for food. This is the result of listening to Chairman Mao's words and organizing to go from poverty to wealth.

We will forever follow Chairman Mao and take the socialist path, unchanging even if the seas dry up and the stones crumble. The biggest backer of the directors of the film "Two Families" is the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party. This person has always opposed Chairman Mao, and during the three years of difficulty, he instructed the counter-revolutionary revisionists in the cultural field to use films and dramas to oppose Chairman Mao and attack socialism. He eats the grain grown by the working people, wears the cloth woven by the working people, and lives in the buildings built by the working people. However, he speaks the words of landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists, does things beneficial to landlords, rich peasants, and capitalists, and walks the path of restoring capitalism. If he usurps the Party and the government, we working people will suffer twice, and the socialist mountains and rivers will change color. We must overthrow the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party along with "Two Families" and forever follow Chairman Mao to revolutionize for life, resolutely taking the socialist path.

　　《两家人》是鼓吹资本主义复辟的宣言书
　　——云南省晋宁县晋城公社干部社员批判反动影片《两家人》
    在无产阶级文化大革命进入向党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派展开总攻击的时候，鼓吹资本主义复辟的反动影片《两家人》拿出来示众了。作为影片取材背景的云南省晋宁县晋城公社的干部社员们，怀着无比愤怒的心情，严厉声讨影片编导者和他们的总后台——党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派反党、反社会主义、反毛泽东思想的滔天罪行。
    乔正国（原小寨乡农协主任、现党支部委员）：一九六三年，影片《两家人》的编导者跑到我们这里拍电影，他们还专门给我拍了几个镜头。我当时很高兴，心想：“有毛主席领导，咱们穷人翻了身，不仅经常看电影，还能上电影。”那晓得拍出来的影片，不但没有表现我们贫下中农对毛主席、对社会主义的无限热爱，反而污蔑我们贫农。影片里的“老贫农”高正国，根本不是贫农，而是个顽固地反对社会主义的人。他听说要卖余粮，就拚命抵制；听说要办合作社，愁得吃不下饭，睡不着觉；为了发家致富走资本主义道路，逼得别人跳井自杀。这那里会是贫农干的事，完全是地主、富农干的。影片的编导者捏造这样一个假贫农，鼓吹单干，就是要为党内最大的走资本主义道路的当权派在中国农村复辟资本主义作舆论准备。
    我们贫下中农从自己的亲身经历中深深懂得：谁是我们的亲人，谁是我们的敌人，那条路是阳关大道，那条路是悬崖断壁。解放前我给地主种田，缺衣少穿，无法度日。解放后，毛主席领导我们翻了身，生活越过越甜，我从心眼里感谢伟大领袖毛主席。毛主席他老人家指到那里，我就奔到那里。我这一辈子跟毛主席就是跟定了。党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派，妄想复辟资本主义，要把我们引向黑暗的旧社会，这是白日作梦、痴心妄想！
    李家强（原互助组员、现大队贫协主席）：影片《两家人》千方百计美化资本主义，把单干说成好得很，把我们走合作化道路的贫下中农写得少吃没穿，连互助组长也得向搞单干的高正国借粮讨米，这是极大的歪曲。一九五三年我们小寨合作社成立的时候，遇到了大旱灾。要是在解放前，不知道又要有多少人离乡背井，家破人亡，妻离子散。可是，我们依靠合作化，战胜了旱灾，取得了很好的收成。在卖余粮时，我们这个十五户的小社，一下就卖一万二千多斤，超额二千多斤。我要质问那些反革命修正主义分子，你们什么时候见过我们组织起来的贫下中农缺粮少穿，去乞求单干的地富分子一粒粮食？你们通过高正国的口，说出了地富要说的话；通过高正国的手，做出了地富要做的事；通过高正国这个假贫农来攻击党、反对农业合作化。你们的贼心，我们贫下中农看得清清楚楚。
    李政英（原互助组副组长、现任生产队长）：影片《两家人》是射向社会主义的一支毒箭。一九五二年，我们贫下中农响应伟大领袖毛主席提出的农业合作化的伟大号召，在农村办起生产合作社、信用合作社、消费合作社。这对党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派抛出的“四大自由”是当头一棒。后来合作社迅速发展起来，一九五八年实现了人民公社化。我们深深体会到农民组织起来走社会主义道路就是好。我们还编民歌唱道：“单干好比独木桥，心惊脚软随风摇，农业社好比大石桥，大风大浪不动摇，人民公社大铁桥，万吨火车往前跑。”可是《两家人》颠倒黑白，硬说单干比组织起来好，公开攻击社会主义制度，妄想复辟资本主义，这办不到，永远办不到。
    李凤仪（原小寨乡互助组长、合作社长、党支部书记）：影片《两家人》根据党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派的黑指示，明目张胆地歌颂单干好，企图把我们贫下中农引到资本主义邪路上去，这是痴心妄想。我们贫下中农最听毛主席的话，最愿意走社会主义道路。一九五二年初，我们小寨的贫下中农就给伟大领袖毛主席写信，表示一定要走互助合作的道路。毛主席叫党中央办公厅给我们回信，鼓励我们走社会主义道路的积极性。毛主席的关怀，给了我们最大的鼓舞，我们在全省办起了第一个互助组，接着根据大家的要求，又成立了农业生产合作社。贫下中农说：“互助组比单干好，合作社又比互助组好，我们一定要入社。”小寨乡农业合作化运动的历史事实证明，广大贫下中农最拥护社会主义。这给党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派一个响亮的耳光：什么“三自一包”呀，什么单干呀，什么“长期保护富农经济”呀，统统是胡说八道！
    李民芬（原互助组员）、杨树荣（晋城公社党委副书记）：在三年困难时期，党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派叫嚷什么“三自一包”，刮起了“单干风”。我们这里的地主富农听了拍手叫好，说什么：“田还家，牛归主，各种各的”，妄图进行反攻倒算。这个时候，反动影片《两家人》出笼了。影片编导者通过高正国之口，公开宣扬“猪往前拱，鸡往后扒，各有各的路”和“天下总是有穷有富”的剥削阶级的反动谬论。他们这伙人想的是一个心思，唱的是一个调子，就是要搞资本主义复辟。党内最大的一小撮走资本主义道路的当权派和牛鬼蛇神们听着：你们妄图在中国复辟资本主义的阴谋，永远不能得逞。
    叶永昌（小寨大队党支部书记）、蒋凤仙（原互助组员、现大队妇女主任）：我们贫下中农最恨资本主义，最爱社会主义。解放前小寨乡一百五十八户人家，就有一百四十六户租地主的田种，每年交了租子，所剩粮食只够吃两个月，生活惨得很。解放后，有毛主席领导，我们打倒了地主，当家作了主人，走上了合作化的道路。十年来，我们照着党所指出的社会主义光明大道，越走越亮堂。我们兴修了水库，安装了各种抽水机、内燃机，彻底改变了过去靠天吃饭的日子。这都是听了毛主席的话，组织起来由穷变富的结果。
    我们永远跟毛主席走社会主义道路，海枯石烂不变心。影片《两家人》编导者的总后台就是党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派。这个家伙一直和毛主席唱对台戏，在三年困难时期，他指使文艺界的反革命修正主义分子利用电影、戏剧反对毛主席，攻击社会主义。他吃的是劳动人民种出的粮食，穿的是劳动人民织出的布，住的是劳动人民盖的楼房，但是，他讲的是地主、富农、资本家的话，做的是对地主、富农、资本家有利的事，走的是复辟资本主义的路。如果让他篡党篡政，我们劳动人民就要吃二遍苦，社会主义江山就要改变颜色。我们一定要把党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派连同《两家人》一齐打倒，一定要永远跟着毛主席干一辈子革命，坚决走社会主义的道路。
