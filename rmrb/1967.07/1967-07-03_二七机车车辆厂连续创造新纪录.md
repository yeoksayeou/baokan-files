	The proletarian revolutionary faction of the Beijing No. 27 Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory (Changxindian Locomotive and Rolling Stock Factory) has, after seizing control of the entire factory, led the workers in a fierce revolution and a rapid push for production with the bold spirit of "We are not only good at destroying an old world, but we will also be good at building a new world." They have successfully completed this year's national plan for the first half of the year. Since April, they have consecutively set new records for the highest number of locomotive and freight car overhauls in the factory's history for three months. In June, fifteen out of the twenty-one locomotives that left the factory passed the first test run successfully, setting a new record that has never been achieved since the factory's establishment.

　　二七机车车辆厂连续创造新纪录
    北京二七机车车辆工厂（长辛店机车车辆工厂）的无产阶级革命派，在掌握全厂大权以后，以“我们不但善于破坏一个旧世界，我们还将善于建设一个新世界”的豪迈气概，领导全厂职工狠抓革命，猛促生产，胜利完成了今年上半年的国家计划；并从四月份起，连续三个月创造建厂以来大修机车和货车的最高纪录。六月份，这个厂出厂的二十一台机车，就有十五台达到了一次试车成功，开创建厂以来从未有过的新纪录。
