Famine year after year, corpses litter the land, and disaster-stricken India has finally ignited the flames of armed revolution. Farmers in the Darjeeling region, under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, have risen up. Farmers in many regions of India, inspired by the armed struggle of the Darjeeling farmers, have also risen up.

“Red flags rise, serfs take up arms,” “Awaken the masses of workers and peasants!” All revolutionary people around the world applaud this. The Indian reactionaries are terrified and panic-stricken, shouting that this “will turn into a national disaster.”

India is a rich country. With a population of 500 million, it has 228 million acres of arable land, averaging 4.5 acres per person; half of which is fertile alluvial soil. India is located in the tropics and subtropics, with no frost period throughout the year, allowing for two to three harvests annually. However, due to the brutal exploitation and sellout policies of the Indian reactionary government, the hundreds of millions of people in this rich country are struggling on the brink of starvation, making India the country with the most severe grain shortage in the world.

As early as 1956, during the discussion of India's second five-year plan, Nehru boasted: “We will not only fully supply grain domestically but also export more grain.” Five years later, not only did they not export any, but they imported even more. In 1961, the Congress Party boasted of increasing grain production from 760 million tons to 1 billion tons. But in 1966, not only did it not increase, but it decreased to 720 million tons, 40 million tons less than five years ago.

No matter how big the cake is drawn, it still cannot fill the stomach. The suffering of the Indian people is getting worse year by year. Now in India, 300 million people are not eating enough. 150 million laboring masses are facing the threat of death on the brink of starvation. Grain rations are constantly decreasing. In Bihar state, the daily ration for adults is only 2.26 catties, and for children, it is only 1.13 catties, and even this meager supply cannot be guaranteed.

Under these circumstances, grass, tree leaves, jute leaves, coconut seeds, and mango seeds are all used to fill empty stomachs. Millions of starving people, supporting the elderly and carrying children, leave their homes and wander, dying of hunger on the roads. It is reported that 4 million people die of hunger every year. However, the Indian Prime Minister shamelessly says: “These deaths are due to old age, poor health, and illness.”

The Indian reactionary government adopts a policy of suppressing domestic resistance and begging abroad. On one hand, it suppresses the resistance of the people at home, and on the other hand, it stages anti-China farces to beg for a few scraps from its masters, the American imperialists and Soviet revisionists. The former Indian Minister of Food, Patel, shamelessly calls this the “cheapest” and “most convenient” method.

But the more anti-China farces are staged, the emptier the begging stomachs become. From 1951 to 1956, an average of 8.3 million tons of grain was imported annually, but in 1966, 150 million tons were imported, an increase of 18 times. Even so, it is still “a drop in the bucket,” still “unload one ship, eat one ship.” The Soviet revisionist clique is already “a mud Buddha crossing the river, unable to save itself.” To boost the morale of its anti-China younger brother, it recently managed to scrape together 20 million tons of grain, “donating” it to India to fill the gaps in its teeth.

India's grain shortage is the inevitable result of the Indian reactionary government's rotten, brutal, and sellout policies. To cover up the truth, the Indian reactionary government concocts a set of absurd reasons:

First, they say: “There are too many Indians.” In his book “The Discovery of India,” Nehru rants about how “the overpopulation of an unenlightened race—growing without prior notice and warning, thus disrupting the planned or unplanned measures of a benevolent government—is to be condemned.” This is a rehash of the reactionary Malthusian “population theory.” India's grain shortage is not due to “too many people” but to the reactionary social system. As long as the Indian people unite and wage armed revolution, smash the Indian reactionary rule, and establish a people's government, the problem can be solved.

Second, they say: “Indians eat too much.” The Indian Prime Minister complains that Indians eat too much and wants people to “change their eating habits” to match the level of agricultural production. The Indian “Politician's Report” indeed knows how to play politics. It says: “The pain of hunger may be purely a mental sensation.” With only a little over 2 catties of grain per person per day, they still complain about eating too much, still want to “change eating habits,” and hunger is “purely a mental sensation.” This is utterly absurd. Some Indian scholars even advocate that people can live without grain, relying only on sunlight, air, and water. They also promote that in Lucknow City, there is a person who “relying on Indian martial arts and qi gong,” has not eaten for 22 days and is still alive. This is sheer nonsense. These poor “scholars,” to adapt to their political needs, have degenerated to such an extent.

Third, they say: “There are too many rats in India.” Rats become the scapegoat. The Indian reactionary government makes a big deal out of rats, saying that India has 2.4 billion rats, which eat 260 million tons of grain every year. They say that if there were no rats, India would not only solve the grain shortage but would also become a surplus grain country. Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi believes that “the primary solution to the grain shortage is to launch a nationwide rat extermination campaign.” Truly, like father, like daughter. Nehru discovered that India's population was excessive, and his daughter discovered that India's rats were also overpopulated. Each discovery is more novel; each conclusion is more absurd.

In fact, to say that India's grain shortage is caused by “rats” is also true. India's grain has indeed been ravaged by a group of “big rats.” This group of “rats” refers to the feudal princes, landlords, bureaucratic comprador bourgeoisie, and their agents, the Congress Party, the Deng Xiaoping traitor clique, and so on. In the countryside, this group of “rats” makes up only 15% of the population but owns 85% of the land. Rent accounts for 50% to 75% of the farmers' harvest. The annual interest rate of usury is over 200%. Various taxes are as numerous as hairs on a cow's back. The Indian reactionary government, in collusion with the American wolf and the Soviet fox, presses down on the Indian people like a mountain.

The “rats” must be eliminated, and the “wolves” must be driven away.

Our great leader Chairman Mao teaches: “The central task and highest form of revolution is to seize political power through armed struggle, to solve problems through war.” With power, the proletariat and laboring people have everything. Once power is in hand, billionaires and trillionaires can be overthrown in an instant; grain problems, clothing problems, and all other problems can be solved. The Indian revolutionary people should unite, arm themselves, and seize power. This is the only correct path for the Indian revolution. Farmers in the Darjeeling region of India, under the leadership of the revolutionary faction of the Communist Party of India, have resolutely taken the path of armed struggle according to Chairman Mao's teachings. Thus, a new dawn has appeared in the Indian revolution. Persisting in the path of Mao Zedong, the Indian revolution will surely achieve victory. The Indian people will be able to break their shackles and gain complete liberation.

    拿起枪，走武装斗争的道路
    中华人民共和国粮食部“粮食公社”
    饥荒连年，饿殍遍野，灾难深重的印度，终于燃起了武装革命的烈火。大吉岭地区的农民，在印度共产党革命派的领导下，冲杀出来了。印度不少地区的农民，在大吉岭农民武装斗争鼓舞下，冲杀出来了。
    “红旗卷起农奴戟”，“唤起工农千百万”！全世界的革命人民无不为此拍手叫好。印度反动派被吓得惊慌失措，惊呼这“将会变成全国性的灾难”。
    印度是个富饶之国。五亿人口，拥有二十二亿八千多万亩耕地，平均每人四亩半；其中一半是肥沃的冲积土壤。印度地处热带、亚热带，终年无霜期，一年可收两季到三季。然而，由于印度反动政府的残酷压榨和卖国政策，使这个富饶国家的几亿人民挣扎在饥饿线上，成为世界上最严重的粮荒之国。
    远在一九五六年，尼赫鲁在讨论印度第二个五年计划时，就曾大吹牛皮：“我们不仅要在国内充分供应粮食，而且还要出口更多的粮食”。五年后，不仅没有出口，而且进口得更多了。一九六一年国大党吹牛要使粮食产量从七千六百万吨上升到一亿吨。但一九六六年不仅未上升，反而下降到七千二百万吨，比五年前还少四百万吨。
    饼画得再大，仍不能充饥，印度人民的苦难一年比一年加重。如今在印度，三亿人吃不饱。一亿五千万劳苦大众，在饥饿线上面临死亡的威胁。粮食配给量不断下降。在比哈尔邦，成年人每天定量合二点二六市两，儿童只有一点一三市两，就这样低微的供应数量还不能保证。
    在这种情况下，草根、树叶、黄麻叶、棕树籽、芒果籽都被用来填充荒腹。千万饥民，扶老携幼，背井离乡，四出逃亡，不断地饿死在流浪的路旁。据报道，一年要饿死四百万人。然而印度总理却胡说什么：“这些人死亡是由于年老、不健康和生病等原因造成的”。
    印度反动政府采取对内讨伐，对外讨饭的政策。一面镇压国内人民的反抗，一面大演反华丑剧，以便向它的主子美帝、苏修讨得几口剩饭。印度前粮食部长帕蒂尔恬不知耻地称此是“最便宜”，“最便当”不过的办法。
    但是反华丑剧越演越凶，讨饭肚皮却越讨越空。一九五一至一九五六年，平均每年进口八十三万吨粮食，而一九六六年就进口一千五百万吨，增加了十八倍。即便如此也只是“杯水车薪”，仍然是“卸一船，吃一船”。苏修集团，早是“泥菩萨过江，自身难保”，为了给它的反华难弟打气，最近好不容易，东拼西凑弄了二十万吨粮食，“赠给”印度塞塞牙齿缝。
    印度的粮荒，是印度反动政府腐朽、残暴、卖国的必然结果。印度反动政府为了遮人耳目，编造出一套荒唐透顶的理由：
    一曰：“印度人太多了”。尼赫鲁在他《印度的发现》一书中，胡说什么：“一个没有远见的种族的这种人口过剩——增加时又不预先通知和警告，从而打乱了一个仁慈政府有计划或无计划的措施——是应该被谴责的”。这是反动的马尔萨斯的“人口论”的翻版。印度的粮荒根本不是由于什么“人太多了”，而是由于反动的社会制度。印度人民只要团结起来进行武装革命，打烂印度反动统治，建立人民政权，便能解决问题。
    二曰：“印度人吃得多了”。印度总理嫌印度人民吃得太多，要人们“改变他们的饮食习惯”，以便同农业生产水平相适应。印度的《政治家报》的确会搞政治，它说：“感到饥饿的痛苦，可能完全是头脑中的感觉”。每人每天只有二两多粮食，还嫌吃得多，还要“改变饮食习惯”，饿了“完全是头脑中的感觉”，真是荒唐透顶。印度有些御用学者更神奇，竟然鼓吹人能够不吃粮食，只靠阳光、空气和水活命。还宣传在勒克瑙市有个人“靠印度式的力功和气功”，二十二天没吃东西还能活着。真是无稽之谈。这些可怜的“学者”，为了适应他们的政治需要，已堕落到何等地步。
    三曰：“印度老鼠太多了”。老鼠成了替罪羊。印度反动政府在老鼠身上大做文章，说印度有二十四亿只老鼠，每年吃掉二千六百多万吨粮食。还说如果没有这些老鼠，印度不仅能解决粮荒，还会成为一个余粮国家。印度总理英迪拉·甘地认为，“解决粮荒的首要问题是在全国开展一个灭鼠运动”。真是有其父必有其女。尼赫鲁发现印度的人口过剩，而其女儿又新发现印度的老鼠也繁殖过剩了。发现一个比一个新奇；结论一个比一个荒唐。
    其实，要说印度粮荒是“老鼠”造成的，也是事实。印度的粮食确实被一群“大老鼠”糟踏了。这群“老鼠”就是那些封建王公、地主、官僚买办资产阶级，及其代理人国大党，丹吉叛徒集团等等。在农村，这群“老鼠”只占百分之十五，而却拥有百分之八十五的土地。地租占农民收成的百分之五十到百分之七十五。高利贷的年利达百分之二百以上。苛捐杂税又多如牛毛。印度反动政府勾结美国狼、苏修狐象大山一样压在印度人民头上。
    “老鼠”必须消灭，“豺狼”必须赶走。
    我们的伟大领袖毛主席教导说：“革命的中心任务和最高形式是武装夺取政权，是战争解决问题。”有了政权，无产阶级、劳动人民就有了一切。一旦政权在手，什么百万富翁、亿万富翁，一下子就可以打倒；什么粮食问题、穿衣问题，都可以解决。印度革命人民团结起来，武装起来，夺取政权，就是印度革命唯一正确的道路。印度大吉岭地区的农民，在印度共产党革命派的领导下，按照毛主席的教导，毅然决然地走上武装斗争的道路。这样，印度革命就出现了新的曙光。坚持走毛泽东的道路，印度革命就必将取得胜利。印度人民就能够打碎自己身上的枷锁，获得彻底解放。
