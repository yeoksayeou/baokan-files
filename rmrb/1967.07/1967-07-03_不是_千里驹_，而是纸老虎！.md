Not a "Thousand-Mile Horse," but a Paper Tiger!

Cai Qingji
Militia cadre of the Rich Country Production Brigade, Fengcheng County, Liaoning Province

After watching the reactionary film *Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles*, I was so angry my lungs nearly burst. The film distorts right and wrong, portraying the remnants of the Nationalist reactionary forces, who were defeated by our army, as if they were triumphant, united, and "heroic." This is utterly reactionary.

We are old militia members from the area where the events in *Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles* took place. We are eyewitnesses to these historical facts. The Nationalist reactionary forces were not "thousand-mile horses" but paper tigers that would collapse at the slightest touch. At the beginning of the New Opening Ridge Campaign, our army lured the enemy in. The so-called "thousand-mile horse," the 25th Division, which was supposed to be Chiang Kai-shek's elite force, stormed into our village, killing and burning. At first, the reactionaries seemed terrifying. But when our heroic People's Liberation Army, together with the militia and the masses, launched a counterattack, these paper tigers revealed their true colors. As soon as the guns fired, they fell to the ground, heads down and butts up, like a flock of wild chickens. One bandit soldier hid in a vegetable cellar, but as soon as he stuck his feet in, he saw someone inside and fled in terror. Another bandit hid in a well. When an old man from our village came to draw water, the bandit was shaking so badly he kept shouting, "Save me, save me..." The enemy officers were even more cowardly. They threw their caps into the ditch and changed into soldiers' uniforms. Some didn't even have time to change and were captured alive. The division commander, Li Zhengyi, disguised himself as a cook. When our army pulled him out from the prisoners, he was pale with fear, shaking all over, and bowed to our soldiers, begging for his life. These paper tigers, once captured, were all dejected and disheveled, like a pack of drowning dogs. These ironclad facts show that the enemy was not a "thousand-mile horse" but a genuine paper tiger. Yet the reactionary film *Against the Wind for a Thousand Miles* dredges up the corpse of the enemy's 25th Division, which had already been smashed to pieces by our liberation army, and glorifies it, praising its so-called "thousand-mile horse spirit." The purpose is to revive the spirit of the Nationalist reactionaries and to encourage all the reactionary classes that have lost their "paradise" to launch a frenzied attack on the Party and socialism. This film is completely aimed at creating public opinion for the counter-revolutionary restoration of capitalism by the biggest capitalist-roader in the Party. The Chinese people, armed with Mao Zedong Thought, see through the wolfish ambitions of these counter-revolutionary revisionists. We must thoroughly criticize and expose this poisonous weed and overthrow the chief culprit of the capitalist restoration, China's Khrushchev!

　　不是“千里驹”，而是纸老虎！
　　辽宁省凤城县富国大队老民兵基干队员  蔡庆吉
    看了反动影片《逆风千里》，我的肺都要气炸了。影片颠倒黑白，把被我军打得落花流水的国民党反动派的残兵败将，描绘成耀武扬威、“精诚团结”、“宁死不屈”的“英雄好汉”，这真是反动透顶。
    我们是《逆风千里》这部影片的故事发生地区的老民兵，是这些历史事实的见证人。国民党反动派的军队根本不是什么“千里驹”，而是一戳就破的纸老虎。在新开岭战役开始的时候，我军诱敌深入，号称蒋介石王牌的“千里驹”二十五师，气势汹汹地闯进了我们村，杀人放火，看起来反动派的样子是可怕的。但是，当我英雄的人民子弟兵在民兵和群众的配合下一进行反击，这些纸老虎就现了原形。真是“枪一响，地下躺，头扎地，腚朝上，活象野鸡一个样。”有一个匪兵往菜窖里躲，两只脚刚想往菜窖里伸，发觉里面有人，吓得没命地跑。还有一个匪兵躲在一眼水井里，我村一位老大爷去打水时，这个匪兵吓的直哆嗦，连声喊“救命，救命……。”敌人的军官更是怕死鬼，都把大盖帽甩到河沟里，换上士兵的衣服，有的没来得及换就被活捉了。敌师长李正谊打份成伙伕，被我军从俘虏群中揪出来时，吓的面无人色，浑身哆嗦，见到我军战士就鞠躬，请求饶命。这些现了原形的纸老虎当了俘虏之后，个个垂头丧气，狼狈不堪，活象一群落水狗。这些铁的事实，说明敌人根本不是什么“千里驹”，是地地道道的纸老虎。而反动影片《逆风千里》，却抬出早已被我解放军打得稀巴烂的敌二十五师这具僵尸，加以美化，鼓吹它的什么“千里驹精神”，目的就是要为国民党反动派招魂，为一切失去了“天堂”的反动阶级鼓气，煽动他们起来向党和社会主义发动猖狂的进攻。这部影片完全是为党内最大的走资本主义道路当权派搞反革命复辟制造舆论的。用毛泽东思想武装起来的中国人民，一眼看穿了这伙反革命修正主义分子的狼子野心，我们一定要把这株大毒草批深批臭，把复辟资本主义的罪魁祸首中国的赫鲁晓夫斗倒斗垮！
