Our great leader Chairman Mao has pointed out: "The American reactionaries will also, like all reactionaries in history, be proved to have no real power. In America, there is another class of people who are truly powerful, and that is the American people."

The massive outbreak of the American black people's struggle against violence has once again proven this truth with living facts.

The blazing fires in Detroit have frightened the American ruling class. Johnson hurriedly dispatched nearly twenty thousand military police to suppress the struggle, while at the same time issuing a statement calling for national "prayer for peace," engaging in deception. They are truly terrified day and night. Following the black people's struggle in Detroit, black people in other cities have also risen up to join the fight. The rapid development of the armed struggle against violence by black people has thrown the White House into chaos. This fully demonstrates that the seemingly powerful American ruling class is nothing but a paper tiger. It is not the fighting black people who fear the American ruling class, but the American ruling class who fear the brave black people.

All reactionaries rely on deception and violence to maintain their reactionary rule. Therefore, once the broad masses of the people become aware, neither believing their deception nor fearing their violence, the reactionaries' rule will be difficult to maintain. This is also the case with American imperialism's rule at home.

Every government of the United States has used so-called "civil rights plans" to lull the black people's struggle for freedom and liberation, while using brutal suppression by military police to force black people to endure their slavery. However, the black people, through their own struggle practice, have gradually seen through the counter-revolutionary two-handed tactics of the American ruling class. From the struggle in Little Rock to the "Freedom March" in Washington, and from the armed struggle against violence in Watts to the armed struggle against violence in Detroit, it shows the gradual awakening of American black people. More and more black people are taking the path of using revolutionary violence to resist counter-revolutionary violence. This is what the American ruling class fears the most. The reason why the Johnson government is at a loss in the face of the black people's struggle against violence is precisely this.

The American reactionaries are just a small clique. In the American population, they account for only a few percent. This few percent oppresses more than ninety percent of the American people, including twenty million black people. The white working class and other oppressed classes in America have the same interests as the black people. The broad masses of the American people represent the progressive and new forces, while the American ruling class represents the reactionary and decaying forces. In the end, the power of the people is invincible. The American people unite, and the revolutionary people of the world unite, and together we fight, we will make the small clique of American reactionaries fall into complete isolation, fall into the encirclement of the masses of the people, and we can accelerate the downfall of American imperialism.

Chairman Mao said: "The people, and the people alone, are the motive force in the making of world history." America belongs to the American people. The revolutionary struggle of the American people will surely achieve final victory.

    真正有力量的是人民

    我们伟大领袖毛主席指出：“美国反动派也将要同一切历史上的反动派一样，被证明为并没有什么力量。在美国，另有一类人是真正有力量的，这就是美国人民。”
    美国黑人抗暴斗争的大爆发，以活生生的事实再一次证明了这个真理。
    底特律燃起的熊熊烈火，吓坏了美国统治集团。约翰逊慌慌张张派了近两万名军警去镇压，同时又发表公告要求全国“祈祷和平”，进行欺骗。真是日夜不安，惊恐万状。继底特律黑人掀起抗暴斗争之后，其他城市的黑人又纷纷起来参加战斗。黑人武装抗暴斗争的迅猛发展，把白宫搞得混乱一团。这就充分表明，貌似强大的美国统治集团，不过是个纸老虎。不是战斗的黑人害怕美国统治集团，而是美国统治集团害怕英勇抗暴的黑人群众。
    一切反动派都是依靠欺骗和暴力这两手，来维持他们的反动统治的。因此，一旦广大人民觉悟起来，既不相信他们的欺骗，又不害怕他们的暴力，反动派的统治就难以维持下去了。美帝国主义在国内的统治也是这样。
    美国历届政府都是一面用什么“民权计划”来麻痹黑人群众争取自由解放的斗争，一面用军警的野蛮镇压来迫使黑人群众忍受他们的奴役。可是，黑人群众从自己的斗争实践中，逐渐识破了美国统治集团的反革命两手。从小石城的群众斗争和华盛顿的“自由进军”，到瓦茨区和底特律的武装抗暴斗争，表现了美国黑人觉悟的逐步提高。越来越多的黑人群众，走上了用革命的暴力反抗反革命暴力的斗争道路。这是美国统治集团所最害怕的。约翰逊政府在黑人抗暴斗争面前慌了手脚，原因就在这里。
    美国反动派不过是一小撮。在美国人口中，他们只占百分之几。这百分之几，压迫着百分之九十以上的包括两千万黑人在内的广大美国人民。美国白色人种中的无产阶级和其他遭受压迫的阶层，同黑人群众的利益是一致的。广大美国人民代表着进步和新生的势力，而美国统治集团则代表着反动和腐朽没落的势力。归根结底，人民的力量是不可战胜的。美国人民团结起来，全世界革命人民团结起来，共同战斗，就将使一小撮美国反动派陷入完全的孤立，陷入人民群众的重重包围之中，就可以加速美帝国主义的灭亡。
    毛主席说：“人民，只有人民，才是创造世界历史的动力。”美国是属于美国人民的。美国人民的革命斗争，一定会取得最后胜利。
