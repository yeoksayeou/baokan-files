Title: Launch a Fierce Attack on China's Khrushchev
Author: Shengu Rong
Date: 1967-07-30
Edition: 6

Soldiers and officers of the Fifth Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army have taken up the mighty cudgel of Mao Zedong Thought, using both their words and pens to denounce the greatest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road. This is them compiling a blackboard newspaper for a big criticism session.

Pick up the pen as if it were a weapon, and thoroughly defeat the greatest power-holder within the Party who is taking the capitalist road politically, ideologically, and theoretically! The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of the East China Sea Fleet performs for the soldiers on the ship.

The Mao Zedong Thought propaganda team of the Eighth Company of a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, which is supporting agricultural production, together with the poor and lower-middle peasants, exposes and criticizes the heinous crimes of China's Khrushchev in attempting to restore capitalism. They use Chairman Mao's works as their weapons and their own bitter experiences to criticize his reactionary fallacy of "exploitation is meritorious."

Soldiers and officers of the Third Tank Company of a certain unit of the Guangzhou Military Region of the People's Liberation Army are holding high the banner of revolutionary criticism led by Chairman Mao, determined to fight down, fight to ruin, and fight to stink out China's Khrushchev, making sure he never gets back on his feet again. This is the soldiers holding a meeting to criticize "Self-Cultivation."

Revolutionary cadres from various general departments, the National Defense Science and Technology Commission, and the headquarters of the Army, Navy, and Air Force in Beijing, with deep hatred for China's Khrushchev, held a criticism meeting, vehemently denouncing the heinous crimes of the biggest handful of power-holders within the Party who are taking the capitalist road—crimes of being anti-Party, anti-socialism, and anti-Mao Zedong Thought. They are determined to fight them down, fight them to ruin, and fight them to stink, thoroughly eliminating their poisonous influence.
