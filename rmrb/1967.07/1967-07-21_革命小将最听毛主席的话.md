In Beijing's No. 32 Middle School, the first-year class of junior high, with the help of the People's Liberation Army, achieved class unity. However, there was one issue that the class revolutionary committee did not know how to handle.

The situation was as follows. There were five or six students in the class who were influenced by the reactionary "bloodline theory," believing that their family backgrounds were good and discriminating against classmates with poorer family backgrounds, making those classmates unable to hold their heads high in class. They did not demand much of themselves, paid little attention to their own ideological transformation, and had poor organizational discipline. During classes, while most students listened attentively, they would knit socks, make wallets, read comic books, and sometimes even cause disturbances, making it difficult for the classes to proceed. To correct this phenomenon, the class revolutionary committee had publicly criticized them harshly on two occasions.

Instead of changing, they became even more unruly. The leaders of the class revolutionary committee then mobilized the entire class to post many big-character posters against these few students. Under the pressure of the big-character posters, those students wrote several "self-criticisms." However, since the problem was not truly resolved ideologically, their opposition to the class revolutionary committee grew even stronger.

At this time, PLA Platoon Leader Zhang Jiying guided the class revolutionary committee members to seek advice from Chairman Mao's works. Chairman Mao said, "When dealing with ideological issues within the people, with issues of the spiritual world, using simple methods will not only be ineffective but also very harmful." He also said, "To make others submit, one can only persuade, not force. The result of forcing submission is always that they are forced but do not submit."

The revolutionary youth listen most to Chairman Mao's words, recognizing their mistake, immediately corrected it, and actively approached these few students. They adhered to the principle of "not yielding on major issues, not arguing over minor ones," actively carried out heart-to-heart talks, sincerely opened their hearts, and did not retreat even when faced with resistance. During these talks, the class revolutionary committee members first conducted self-criticism, examining their previous harsh attitudes and simple methods towards these students. At the same time, they used the living facts from the period when the school was under the control of the bourgeois reactionary line to jointly denounce the harm this reactionary line had done to young people, and together studied Chairman Mao's works, jointly criticized the reactionary "bloodline theory," and finally improved their relationship with these few students.

For every small progress made by these few students, the class revolutionary committee promptly gave encouragement. Through a series of warm, sincere, and patient help, these students were deeply moved and voluntarily made soul-searching self-criticisms. From then on, they followed Chairman Mao's teachings, strictly demanding of themselves ideologically, and did more good deeds for the collective.

The class revolutionary committee members, through handling this matter, personally felt that: "In the past, we tried to use force to push them onto Chairman Mao's revolutionary line, but the more we forced them, the more they resisted and the tighter they held on; later, by seeking advice from Chairman Mao's works, we adopted the method of persuasion and education, and they quickly changed. This incident made us realize: above all, the most important thing is to use Mao Zedong Thought to educate people."

    革命小将最听毛主席的话
    马贵民
    北京市三十二中初中一年级一班，在解放军帮助下，实现了班级大联合。但是，有一件事，班文革小组不知道怎么办才好。
    事情是这样的。这个班有五、六个学生受反动“血统论”的影响，觉得自己的家庭出身好，对家庭出身不好的同学，采取歧视的态度，使那些同学在班里抬不起头来。她们对自己要求不严，不注意本身的思想改造，组织纪律性比较差。上课时，大部分同学都专心听讲，她们却在下面打袜子，编钱包，看小人书，有时甚至起哄，使课程很难进行下去。为了纠正这种现象，班文革小组曾经公开狠狠地批评了她们两次。
    她们不但没有改变，反而闹得更厉害了。班文革小组的几个负责人就发动全班同学，给这几个同学贴了许多大字报。在大字报的压力下，那几个同学写了几份“检查”。但是由于没有从思想上真正解决问题，她们和班文革的对立情绪更大了。
    这时候，解放军排长张继业引导班文革小组的几个同学向毛主席著作请教。毛主席说：“对待人民内部的思想问题，对待精神世界的问题，用简单的方法去处理，不但不会收效，而且非常有害。”又说：“要人家服，只能说服，不能压服。压服的结果总是压而不服。”
    革命小将最听毛主席的话，认识到自己错了，马上改正，就主动和这几个同学接近。她们掌握“原则问题不让，枝节问题不争”的原则，积极开展谈心活动，诚恳交心，碰了钉子也不回头。在谈心时，班文革小组的同学首先做自我批评，检查以前对她们态度生硬、方法简单等。同时，利用本校在资产阶级反动路线统治时期的活生生事实，和她们一块控诉这条反动路线对青少年的毒害，并且一块儿学习毛主席著作，一块儿批判反动的“血统论”，终于改善了和这几个同学的关系。
    对于这几个同学的每一个微小的进步，班文革小组都及时给予鼓励。经过一系列热情、诚恳、耐心的帮助，这几个同学很受感动，主动做了触及灵魂的检查。从此以后，她们遵照毛主席的教导，从思想上严格要求自己，为集体多做好事。
    班文革小组的几个同学，从处理这件事情中亲身体会到：“过去我们想用压的方法，把她们压到毛主席的革命路线上来，谁想到越压她们越不服，越压她们越抱的紧；以后向毛主席著作请教，我们采取说服教育的方法，她们很快转变了。这件事，使我们认识到：千重要万重要，用毛泽东思想教育人最重要。”
