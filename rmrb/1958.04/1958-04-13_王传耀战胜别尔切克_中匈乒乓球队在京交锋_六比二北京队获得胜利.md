Xinhua News Agency, April 12th -- The Hungarian national table tennis team lost its first friendly match here tonight. In the four men's singles, three women's singles, and one men's doubles matches against the Beijing table tennis team, they lost six and won two.

Beijing team's famous player Wang Chuanyao tonight used varied tactics to defeat Berczik, the Hungarian team's national champion last year and European men's singles champion this year, by two games to one (21-17, 19-21, 21-10). Wang Chuanyao showed calmness and confidence in this match. He consistently suppressed his opponent with fierce smashes, and often unexpectedly used "squatting" spin serves and long-range shots combined with drop shots, gaining the initiative. However, Berczik was experienced, and his steady spinning chops also posed a great threat to Wang Chuanyao.

The results of the other three men's singles matches tonight were: Beijing team's Fu Qifang defeated Jettwe, this year's European men's singles runner-up, by two games to one (21-17, 15-21, 21-15) with fast rallies; Jiang Yongning defeated Földi, who holds the racket horizontally with his left hand, by two games to one (20-22, 21-12, 21-11). The Hungarian team's Buni also defeated Hu Bingquan, the sixth-place finisher in the national men's singles last year from the Beijing team, by two games to one (16-21, 21-13, 21-18). The result of the men's doubles match was: Beijing team's Wang Chuanyao and Fu Qifang defeated the Hungarian team's Berczik and Buni by two games to zero (21-7, 21-14).

In the three women's singles matches held tonight, Beijing team's player Qiu Zhonghui defeated Lantos, who has won ten world championships, by two games to one (14-21, 21-10, 21-15). However, Qiu Zhonghui also lost to the Hungarian team's national champion last year and European women's singles champion this year, Kóczián, by the opposite score of one to two (14-21, 21-16, 19-21). This match was very tense, with Kóczián being agile and smashing fiercely with both her forehand and backhand. However, Qiu Zhonghui responded with equal force, engaging in aggressive attacks. In the deciding third game, there were ten ties, but after reaching 19-19, Qiu Zhonghui lost two points in a row and ultimately lost the match.

The result of the other women's singles match was: Beijing team's Ye Peiqiong defeated Mossóczi by two games to zero (21-11, 21-9). Mossóczi and Kóczián were the world women's doubles champions last year.

    王传耀战胜别尔切克
    中匈乒乓球队在京交锋
    六比二北京队获得胜利
    新华社12日讯　匈牙利国家乒乓球队今晚在这里举行的第一次友谊比赛中失利。他们在同北京乒乓球队举行的四场男子单打、三场女子单打和一场男子双打比赛中，败六场，胜两场。
    北京队著名选手王传耀今晚用多变的战术以二比一（二十一比十七、十九比二十一、二十一比十）战胜了匈牙利队的去年全国冠军、今年欧洲男子单打冠军别尔切克。王传耀在这场比赛中，表现得冷静而又有信心。他始终以猛烈的抽球压住了对方，并且常出其不意地发“下蹲”式的旋转球和施展远抽近吊的战术，赢得了主动。但是，别尔切克的经验丰富，他的稳健的旋转削球也给王传耀很大威胁。
    今晚其他三场男子单打比赛结果是：北京队的傅其芳用快速的对攻以二比一（二十一比十七、十五比二十一、二十一比十五）胜今年欧洲男子单打亚军杰特维；姜永宁以二比一（二十比二十二、二十一比十二、二十一比十一）胜左手横握球拍的福尔迪。匈牙利队的布尔尼也以二比一（十六比二十一、二十一比十三、二十一比十八）胜北京队的去年全国男子单打第六名胡炳权。一场男子双打比赛结果是：北京队的王传耀和傅其芳以二比零（二十一比七、二十一比十四）胜匈牙利队的别尔切克和布尔尼。
    在今晚举行的三场女子单打比赛中，北京队选手丘钟惠以二比一（十四比二十一、二十一比十、二十一比十五）战胜了曾获十次世界冠军的兰托斯。但是丘钟惠也以相反的比数——一比二（十四比二十一、二十一比十六、十九比二十一）败给了匈牙利队的去年全国冠军、今年欧洲女子单打冠军高基安。这场比赛打得十分紧张，高基安动作灵敏，正手和反手抽球猛烈。但是丘钟惠却以针锋相对，进行强攻。在决定胜负的第三局比赛中，双方曾出现十次平局，但打到十九平以后，丘钟惠因连失二球，终告败北。
    另一场女子单打比赛结果，北京队的叶珮琼以二比零（二十一比十一、二十一比九）胜莫沙奇。莫沙奇同高基安是去年世界女子双打冠军。
