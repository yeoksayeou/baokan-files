    On Translation
    Ye Shengtao
    Some time ago, a comrade in the eighth edition discussed "translation style," saying that translation style is closely related to writing style. I agree with this opinion. Now I would like to say something about translation work. I am not proficient in any foreign language, and I often read translated materials. Based on such qualifications, I am bound to be an amateur. However, amateur ideas often provide a useful reference for experts, so I do not avoid the suspicion of being an amateur.
    What is translation work all about?
    In my opinion, a translator is someone who is proficient in two languages, that is, someone who can use two languages to think and express themselves. Regarding the same meaning, how should it be expressed using language A, and how should it be expressed using language B, the translator knows it clearly and is extremely familiar with it. Based on their understanding of language A, they absorb all the content of the original work in language A, and then, based on their understanding of language B, express it in language B. This is translation work.
    Since there are two languages involved, there are naturally many differences in terms of grammar, rhetoric, word selection, and sentence construction. In short, it is absolutely impossible to mechanically translate word by word by looking up a dictionary. If one doesn't mechanically translate, but judges very appropriately, enabling those who do not understand language A to read the translation and understand it exactly like those who are proficient in language A reading the original, then that is a good translation.
    A good translation is truly a great service to those who do not understand language A. Just imagine, if someone who does not understand language A wants to read the original, they must first learn language A. Just learning a little bit is not enough; they must master it. How much time and energy would that take? Now, with a good translation, one does not need to spend the time and energy learning language A, but can still grasp the entire content of the original work. From a purely economical point of view, the benefits are great enough.
    As for bad translations, in my opinion, there are various situations. Now I will only talk about one of them, which is to remodel language A into the appearance of language B, but in reality, it is still language A. I'm afraid my words are not very clear. To put it more clearly, the translation mostly follows foreign language habits in terms of grammar, rhetoric, and so on, but only uses our country's language materials. To put it even more clearly, the translation becomes foreign language written in Chinese characters.
    Because it is written in Chinese characters, one can read through the whole thing, but it is still a foreign language. Reading it is not very clear, or at least one has to ponder for a while before being able to understand it generally. This is my personal experience. I don't know if my friends have the same feeling.
    If I am blamed for not learning some foreign language habits before reading the translation, I would answer like this: precisely because I do not understand foreign languages, I want to read the translation.
    If someone says that language is constantly changing, and that the influence of foreign languages is welcome, I would say this: the language habits of various languages are quite stable. Our acceptance of foreign influences should be conditional on being compatible with Chinese language habits. And what I am talking about, foreign language written in Chinese characters, refers to those that are incompatible with Chinese language habits.
    Such bad translations have become less and less common in recent years, which is certainly a good phenomenon. However, less does not mean none. There are still some translations, or even parts of a translated work, that are generally good, but certain parts are still foreign language written in Chinese characters, so the translation community still needs to strive for improvement.

    谈谈翻译
    叶圣陶
    前些日子有一位同志在第八版谈到“译风”，说译风跟文风大有关系。我同意这个意见。现在我就翻译工作来说些意思。我不通一种外国语，常常看些翻译东西，凭这样的资格来说些意思，外行当然难免。但是外行想法也往往有足供内行人参考的，所以我不避外行之嫌。
    翻译工作是怎么一回事呢？
    据我想，翻译家是精通两种语言的人，也就是能运用两种语言来思维，来表达的人。同样一个意思，运用甲种语言该怎么样表达，运用乙种语言该怎么样表达，他都心中有数，而且熟极而流。他凭关于甲种语言的素养，吸取了甲种语言的原作里的全部内容，又凭关于乙种语言的素养，用乙种语言把它表达出来，这就是翻译工作。
    既然是两种语言，语法方面，修辞方面，选词造句方面，不同之处当然很多。总之，决不能查了字典，逐个词逐个词死翻。不死翻，衡量得非常恰当，能使不通甲种语言的人读了译本，跟精通甲种语言的人读了原作一模一样，那是好翻译。
    好翻译对不通甲种语言的人，真可以说是功德无量。试想，不通甲种语言的人要读原作，先得学习甲种语言，随便学点儿还不成，必得把它学通，那要花多少时间，多少精力？现在有了好翻译，就不必花学习甲种语言的时间和精力，却可以领会原作的全部内容，单从节约观点说，好处就够大了。
    至于不好的翻译，据我看，情形有种种。现在只说其中的一种，那就是把甲种语言改装成乙种语言的外貌，实际上还是甲种语言。我这个话怕不太明白，说得明白点儿，就是译本在语法、修辞等等方面多半按照外国的语言习惯，不过使用了我国的语言材料而已。再说得明白点儿，就是译本成为用中国字写的外国话。
    因为用中国字写，通篇念得下去，可又是外国话，念下去不甚了了，至少要琢磨半天才能够大体通晓。这是我亲身的经验，不知道朋友们有没有同感。
    如果责备我，为什么不学点儿外国的语言习惯再来读译本，我就这么回答，正因为不通外国语，我才要读译本呢。
    如果说，语言也是不断变化的，语言的外来影响正是值得欢迎的，我就这么说，各种语言的语言习惯都是相当稳定的，咱们接受外来影响要以跟中国的语言习惯合得来为条件，而我所说的用中国字写的外国话，就指那些跟中国的语言习惯合不来的。
    这样不好的翻译，近年来越来越少了，这当然是好现象。然而少不等于没有，还有一篇译文或是一部译作中间，大体都好，可是某些部分却还是用中国字写的外国话，所以翻译界还得力求改进。
