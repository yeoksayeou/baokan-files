Dowry, Prizes, and Tools
Zhangjiakou Supply and Marketing Cooperative　Lü Qingjing
    The People's Daily once published a photograph of Li Yuzhen's father, a member of the Five-Star Cooperative in the suburbs of Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, presenting a pair of manure baskets as a dowry when Li Yuzhen got married. This photograph made me think of a new problem.

    Whether it's an awards ceremony of any kind, or whether the prize is given to a collective or an individual, the prizes we receive are nothing more than various sizes of brocade banners and picture frames, vests, shirts, woolen sweaters, thermos bottles, diaries, towels, toothbrushes, washbasins, bicycles, and so on. Generally speaking, most of these prizes are consumer goods.

    It is said that one unit has received so many different kinds of brocade banners and picture frames over the years that they almost cover the walls of a not-so-small conference room. It is estimated that they are worth two or three thousand yuan.

    I'm not saying that the way we did things in the past was all wrong or unnecessary; I'm just thinking that now, we are all trying to find ways to support the great leap forward in agriculture from all aspects. Wouldn't it be better to buy production tools with this money as prizes in the future! Let's turn some brocade banners and picture frames into carrying poles and manure baskets, into hoes and sickles, into picks and shovels!

    嫁妆·奖品·工具
    张家口供销合作社　律青菁
    人民日报上曾登过一张照片：内蒙古呼和浩特市郊五星社社员李玉针的父亲，在李玉针结婚时陪送一对粪筐。从这张照片我联想到一个新的问题。
    我们不论是什么形式的发奖大会，也不管是奖给集体或是个人，所得到的奖品不外是各样的大小锦旗和镜框、背心、衬衣、绒衣、暖水瓶、日记本、毛巾、牙刷、脸盆、自行车等等，总的来说，这些奖品绝大部分都是属于生活资料一类的。
    据说，有一个单位几年以来，所得到的各式各样的锦旗和镜框，几乎挂满了一个不算很小的会议室的墙壁。据估计，价值两三千元。
    我不是说过去这样作都是不对的，不必要的；我是想：现在，我们都在想办法从各方面支援农业大跃进，今后把这笔钱买成生产工具作为奖品该多好啊！让我们把一些锦旗、镜框变成一些扁担和粪筐，变成一些锄头和镰刀，变成一些镐头和铁锹吧！
