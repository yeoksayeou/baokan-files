    Eagerness to Learn and Originality
    By our reporter Yi Xiao
    In the first quarter of this year, the workers of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory have achieved new successes. After jumping to the first place in the country in product quality, they are now approaching or catching up with the world's advanced level.
    The Xi'an People's Enamel Factory, with only five years of history, does not have better equipment than other factories, its workers are not as experienced as others (90% are young workers), and it does not have as much experience as other factories. Why has production developed so rapidly? There is no other reason, it is the advanced idea of "eagerness to learn and originality" that is driving them forward continuously.
    Not understanding technology and facing many difficulties is certainly not a good thing; but it forces them to learn humbly, which is a good thing. In order to learn technology, the factory director and Party Secretary Di Linjie, deputy directors Ma Ru Ying and Sun Yaozeng, personally went to the workshop to work shifts in production: they and other workers often went to Shanghai and other similar factories to study and consult, almost traveling all over the country; they collected a large amount of domestic and foreign enamel materials in a timely manner and studied them diligently.
    Having many young workers and little experience is certainly not a good thing; but young workers are daring to think and dare to do, which is a good thing. In response to this situation, the factory leadership, while leading all the workers to learn, promoted the spirit of originality, and enriched this experience and scientific knowledge. They humbly learned technology, mastered technology; they were not controlled by technology but controlled technology; they were not bound by existing technology and experience, but boldly broke through these old conventions.
    However, to break through some old conventions, even a very small thing, will encounter stubborn resistance. The Chinese Communist Party organization of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory resolutely relied on young workers, and resolutely fought against various old ideas, paving the way for the development of the spirit of originality. The following are two examples among many.
    When the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory decided to produce a large number of all-red basins, it needed to use a large amount of red enamel powder. Red enamel powder is expensive, equivalent to eight times the price of white enamel powder. At that time, the national practice was to enamel the billet with a primer once, and then enamel it with red enamel powder twice. Although this can guarantee the quality, the use of too much red enamel powder will increase the cost.
    What to do? Is there no way to reduce costs and ensure quality at the same time? After the leadership raised this issue, Zhou Honggen, a group leader in the coating and firing workshop, suggested whether it was possible to apply a layer of white powder after applying the primer, and then apply a layer of red powder instead of applying red powder. The factory Party committee immediately supported him and let him try it.
    Doing things that predecessors have not done will certainly have difficulties, but the technical difficulties are far less than the ideological difficulties. Many people think this is whimsical. Some said: "This is simply impossible. The Yifeng Factory in Shanghai wanted to do this in the past, but they didn't succeed; now no factory in the country is doing this, so let's not waste things!" The experience of the predecessors is like a rope, tying these people's thoughts tightly. In their view, it is destined to fail if they want to surpass the experience of their predecessors. And it is difficult to convince these experienced people without strong perseverance and sufficient facts.
    Zhou Honggen was also a little overwhelmed in this situation. The factory Party committee came out to support him: "Just because other places have failed, does that mean we can't succeed? Be bold, try it first, it doesn't matter if it fails." Zhou Honggen succeeded in his first experiment. Even so, some people still said discouraging things: "This is a fluke, mass production will definitely not work!" Okay, the factory leadership immediately decided to start formal production. It really is a case of good things taking time, and defective products really appeared in the first shift of production: many red basins showed some white streaks. At that time, those who opposed it clamored: "What did I say? It won't work!"
    Seeing that this initiative was about to end, the factory Party committee came out to save it. "We can't just end it like this, even if it fails, we have to figure it out." The leaders personally studied with the workers in the coating and firing workshop, and finally found the reason and came up with a solution, so that the quality of the red basin was completely qualified, saving more than 4,000 yuan last year.
    Traditional experience and the lessons of predecessors did not bind the thinking of the factory's leading cadres and workers; existing scientific basis and existing technical authorities did not restrain their spirit of originality.
    Borax is a necessary raw material to ensure the gloss of enamel products. During a period of time, due to the lack of borax and its high price, the acid resistance and gloss of enamel industrial products in the country were generally poor. The factory's Party committee gave technician Zhang Shiyuan and Wang Yuecheng, a veteran worker and director of the enamel making workshop, a task: to develop a new formula that would use less borax, and still have good gloss and acid resistance.
    Zhang Shida and Wang Yuecheng searched through all the domestic and foreign materials, but could not find such a formula. They told the comrades of the Party committee that they were not sure. The comrades of the Party committee said: "If there are 300 formulas in the world, can't we make it 301!" Encouraged by this thought, and with the guidance of engineer Lu Gengxin, an old worker from the Ministry of Light Industry who was helping at the factory at the time, Zhang Shida and Wang Yuecheng finally developed a new formula called Zero. The borax used in this formula was reduced from 20% to 12.6%. Such a low borax formula was unprecedented in the past enamel industry, and the samples fired were very good in both gloss and acid resistance.
    This bold attempt could not but be opposed by some people who were obsessed with old conventions. At that time, there were two technical authorities in the Chinese enamel industry in the factory: one studied chemical engineering in the United States and obtained a doctorate degree; the other had accumulated 30 years of experience in enamel. Zhang Shida and Wang Yuecheng earnestly consulted them about the Zero formula. When they saw that this formula was proposed by a 26-year-old youth and a worker, and when they found that they had never seen such a formula in domestic and foreign materials, they dismissed it with a smile, thinking that there was no scientific basis.
    The technical authorities took out their own formulas, and said, "This is 'scientifically based', the most advanced formula in the world," and asked for comparative tests. Who knew that the test results showed that this "advanced formula", in addition to the higher price of raw materials than Zero, was not as good as Zero in terms of gloss, acid resistance, heat resistance, and adhesion. The enamel made with this "advanced formula" could not withstand the test, and when heated to 232 degrees Celsius and then cooled to minus 10 degrees Celsius, it shattered into pieces. When the products made with the Zero formula were subjected to the same test, they did not move at all.
    The old scientific and technological theories, like a rope, tied the thinking of these two experts tightly. They were so obsessed with those things that they stubbornly clung to those old clauses even in the face of practice. They proposed an even more advanced formula, until seven formulas in a row, the fate was not much better than the first advanced formula; after comparison, they were not as good as Zero. The Zero formula established its prestige after several tests by the "authorities". The Xi'an People's Enamel Factory quickly put this new formula into production, making a great leap forward in product quality.
    Daring to think and dare to do, daring to break the old conventions in existing technology and science, daring to be the master of science and technology, this spirit of originality, after several storms, has been fully developed among the workers of the Xi'an People's Enamel Factory. After the ropes of old technical experience and scientific clauses that bound the thinking of some workers were untied, new creations continued to emerge. Many things that were not done in the domestic enamel industry in the past have been done by this factory. They made the lively shrimp of Qi Baishi and the divine horses of Xu Beihong appear on the daily enamel for the first time. They also pioneered the use of distilled water to mix enamel powder, making the gloss of the main daily enamel generally reach above 90 degrees, and some reached 106 degrees. After many improvements, now, the product quality indicators of this factory have approached the world's highest level.

    好学和独创
    本报记者　伊晓
    在今年第一个季度里，西安人民搪瓷厂职工又取得了新的成就。他们的产品质量在跃居全国第一之后，现在又接近或赶上世界先进水平。
    只有五年厂龄的西安人民搪瓷厂，论设备没有别的工厂好，论工人没有人家的老（90％都是青年工人），论经验没有别的厂多，为什么生产能这样飞跃发展呢？没有别的，这就是“好学独创”的先进思想在推动他们不断前进。
    不懂技术，困难很多，当然不是件好事；但是逼迫他们虚心学习，却又是好事。为了学习技术，厂长兼党委书记邸林杰、副厂长马儒英和孙耀增，亲自下车间跟班生产：他们和其他职工经常到上海等地同业厂去留学、请教，几乎跑遍了全国各厂；他们及时搜集了大批国内外搪瓷资料，苦心钻研。
    青年工人多，经验少，当然不是好事；但是青年工人敢想、敢干，这又是好事。针对这种情况，厂的领导上在带动全厂工人学习时，发扬了独创精神，丰富了这些经验和科学知识。他们虚心的学习技术，精通技术；他们不为技术所驾驭而驾驭了技术；他们没有为现有技术、经验所束缚，而是大胆的冲破了这些陈规。
    但是，要突破一些老陈规，哪怕是一件很小的事，都会遇到顽固的阻力。西安人民搪瓷厂中共党组织，坚决依靠青年工人，坚毅地和各种旧思想斗争，为发扬独创精神开辟道路。下面讲的，就是许多例子中的两个。
    西安人民搪瓷厂在确定大量生产全红面盆的时候，要用大量的红琅粉。红琅粉价格贵，相当于白琅粉的八倍。当时全国的作法是在坯胎上搪过一次底粉，再搪两次红琅粉。这样做固然可以保证质量，但是，红琅粉使用太多，成本就要加大。
    怎么办呢？难道没有办法作到既降低成本又能保证质量吗？领导上提出这个课题后。涂烧车间的一个叫周宏根的组长就建议是不是可以涂完底粉不搪红粉，搪一层白粉，再搪一层红粉。厂党委马上支持他，让他试试。
    作前人没有作过的事，当然会有困难，但是，技术上的困难，远比不上思想上的困难。许多人都认为这是异想天开。有的说：“这根本是不可能的事。过去上海益丰厂想这样做，都没有弄成功；现在全国没有一家工厂这么作，咱们还是趁早别糟蹋东西吧！”前人的经验像一条绳子，把这些人的思想捆得紧紧的。在他们看来，要越过前人的经验，注定是要失败的。而说服这些经验派，没有坚强的毅力和足够的事实，是很难奏效的。
    周宏根在此情势下也有些撑不住劲了。厂党委出来支持了他：“难道别的地方失败，我们就不能成功吗？大胆的搞，先试一试，坏了也没有关系。”周宏根第一次试验就成功了。虽然如此，还有人说泄气话：“这是碰运气，大批生产一定不行！”好，厂领导上当下就决定正式生产。真是好事多磨，在第一班生产中真出了废品：不少红面盆连连露出来一些白纹路。那时，反对的人都嚷嚷起来：“我说的怎么样？不行吧！”
    眼看着这个创举就要完结了，厂党委出来挽救了它。“不能就这样完事，即使失败也要弄个一清二楚。”领导人亲自和涂烧车间的工人研究，终于找出原因想出办法，使红面盆的质量完全合格，去年一年就节约四千多元。
    传统的经验，前人的教训，没有捆住这个厂领导干部和职工的思想；已有的科学根据，现有的技术权威，也没有束缚住他们的独创精神。
    硼砂是保证搪瓷产品光泽的必需原料，有一个时期，因为缺少硼砂，而且价格昂贵，全国搪瓷工业产品普遍存在耐酸和光度不好的问题。这个厂的党委便给了技术员张士远和老工人、制琅车间主任王月诚一个任务：研究出一个新配方，既要硼砂用的少，还要光泽、耐酸好。
    张士达、王月诚翻遍了国内外所有的资料，却没有找出这么一条。他们向党委会同志说没有把握。党委会同志说：“全世界有三百条的话，难道我们就不能让它有三百零一条吗！”受到这个思想的鼓舞，又得到当时在厂帮助工作的轻工业部的一位老工人出身的陆更新工程师的指导，张士达、王月诚终于研究出一种取名为零号的新配方。这种配方所用的硼砂，由过去的20％减少到12.6％。这样少的硼砂配方在过去搪瓷工业配方中是绝无仅有的，而且烧出来的样品，无论在光泽和耐酸上都很好。
    这种大胆的尝试，不能不受到一些迷恋陈规的人反对。当时，在厂里有两位中国搪瓷工业中的技术权威人士：一位在美国学化工，得过博士学位；另一位搞搪瓷已积有三十年之经验。张士达和王月诚认真地拿零号配方向他们请教。当他们看到这个配方是一个二十六岁的青年和一个工人提出来的时候，当他们发现在国内外资料中从来没有见过这种配方时，就认为没有科学根据而一笑置之。
    技术权威人士拿出了自己的配方，而且说，“这是有‘科学根据’的，世界上最高级的配方”，要求试验比较。谁知试验结果，这个“高级配方”，除了原料价格比零号高以外，光泽、耐酸、耐热、密着力那一点也赶不上零号。这种“高级配方”制成的搪瓷，经不住考验，当加热到摄氏二百三十二度，又降温到摄氏零下十度时，竟然炸得粉碎。用零号配方制的产品，在作同样试验时，却纹丝不动。
    旧有的科学技术理论，像一根绳子一样，把这两位专家的思想捆得紧紧的。他们迷恋那些东西到这种程度，以至在实践面前还顽强地拖住那些陈旧条文不放。他们又提出一个更高级的配方，直到一连七个配方，命运都不比第一个高级配方好多少；比较之后，都不如零号。零号配方在几度经过“权威”考验之后，确立了威信。西安人民搪瓷厂很快就把这个新配方投入生产，使产品质量大大跃进了一步。
    敢想敢干，敢于打破已有技术科学上的陈规，敢于作科学技术的主人，这种独创精神，几经风浪之后，在西安人民搪瓷厂职工中得到了充分发扬。束缚着一些职工思想的陈旧的技术经验和科学条文的绳子被解开之后，新的创造不断涌现。过去许多国内搪瓷上没有作到的事，这个厂都作到了。他们使日用搪瓷上第一次出现了齐白石的生动活泼的虾和徐悲鸿的神骏的群马。他们还首创用蒸馏水调配琅粉，使主要日用搪瓷的光度普遍达到九十度以上，有的达到一百零六度。经过许多改进，现在，这个厂的产品质量指标已经接近了世界最高水平。
