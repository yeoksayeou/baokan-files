Xinhua News Agency, Zhengzhou, April 17th: A Neolithic village site has been discovered in the suburbs of Zhengzhou, containing many complete relics and artifacts.

The site is located on the hills northeast of Houzhuangwang Village in the northwest suburbs of Zhengzhou and was recently discovered by the masses during water conservancy construction.

The hills where the site is located are approximately 500 meters long from north to south and over 600 meters wide from east to west. The site contains ash layers up to four or five meters thick, densely populated with house foundations from the late Neolithic period. More than 20 sites have been discovered, and more than 10 have already been excavated. One of the foundations is 3.7 meters long and about 3 meters wide.

The house foundations in the site are both rectangular and circular. The walls were built with red-fired earth mixed with mud. There are post holes around the walls. Among the excavated house foundations, the maximum number of white ash layers is three. In the middle of the houses, there is also a square platform built of red-fired earth blocks, with the foundation of the platform extending into the ground and the platform surface about one meter above the ground. The platform is also very hard.

The relics in the site include pottery jars, pottery tripods, pottery rings, pottery spinning wheels, and painted pottery with a white base. The pottery is painted with various exquisite patterns such as squares, dots, circles, and parallel lines. Seven complete pottery pieces were placed on the red-fired earth platform inside one house foundation. The site also contains stone shovels, stone axes, and bone arrowheads, needles, hairpins, and other objects. In addition, there are clam shell saws.

Another rare discovery is a large number of tile coffins burying children. More than 200 tile coffins have been cleared out this time alone. The tile coffins come in various types such as pottery urns, pottery jars, and pointed-bottom small-mouth pottery bottles. Next to the tile coffins, there are also burial objects such as pottery bowls, pottery jars, and pottery tripods.
