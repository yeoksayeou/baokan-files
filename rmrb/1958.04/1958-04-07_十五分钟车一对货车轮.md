    Xinhua News Agency dispatch: Zhao Qin, a young lathe operator in the wheel workshop of the Qishuyan Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory, boldly innovated technology and improved operating methods. On March 31st, he machined a pair of freight car wheel treads in 15 minutes and 15 seconds, setting a new national record. The freight car wheel tread is the surface of the wheel that comes into contact with the steel rail. Previously, machining freight car wheel treads was done by Zhao Qin and another worker on a Polish large wheel lathe. The prescribed labor quota was one hour and forty minutes for two people to machine a pair. After repeated research, Zhao Qin boldly proposed that one person operate the machine.

    十五分钟车一对货车轮
    据新华社讯　戚墅堰机车车辆修理工厂车轮车间青年旋工赵勤，大胆革新技术，改进操作方法，3月31日以十五分十五秒的速度车好一对货车轮子踏面，创造了全国最新纪录。货车轮子踏面就是轮子接触钢轨的面。以前加工货车轮子踏面是赵勤和另一个工人在波兰大旋轮机上进行的。规定工时定额是两个人一时四十分车一对。赵勤反复研究，大胆提出由一人操纵机床。
