Tianjin, April 3rd (from our newspaper) – A socialist competition centered on learning advanced experiences and strengthening technical cooperation, called "Learn from Shanghai and Catch Up with Shanghai," has been fully launched in Tianjin's light industrial factories. On March 18th, representatives of 80,000 light industry workers in Tianjin held a "Learn from Shanghai and Catch Up with Shanghai" oath-taking rally, proposing that light industry workers in Shanghai join hands with them to achieve a great leap forward in learning advanced technology, improving product quality, increasing new products, and increasing output.

In their competition proposal to the light industry workers of Shanghai, they proposed that the quality of 69 major products should reach or exceed advanced levels at home and abroad in 1958. Among them, 36 would catch up with or surpass Shanghai or other regions in China, and 33 would catch up with or surpass capitalist countries. The proposal also put forward specific targets and technical measures to be taken for various products. In terms of new products, they will strive to successfully trial-produce 362 types this year, with 80% put into production; and trial-produce 1,457 new product designs. In terms of cost reduction, the cost reduction rate this year should reach 8%, and profits turned over to the state will increase by 75.93% compared with last year. At the same time, 10% of the basic construction investment will be saved. This year, the total output value of light industry in the city will increase by 43.18% compared with last year.

The proposal also stated that this year, they will vigorously supply products for agriculture and sideline industries, and ensure that these products are of good quality and low price. These include cart leather, carts, feed yeast, thermos bottles, soy sauce, and stationery. At the same time, they will make full use of agricultural and sideline products as raw materials to support agricultural production, such as researching the use of cotton stalks, wheat stalks, and sorghum stalks to produce various types of paper. The food industry should increase the variety of processed fruits and meats, establish sub-factories in areas where raw materials are abundant, process them locally, and provide technical guidance on fruit tree maintenance and fruit preservation.

The proposal also stated that they are willing to provide technical support and exchange experiences with Shanghai.
