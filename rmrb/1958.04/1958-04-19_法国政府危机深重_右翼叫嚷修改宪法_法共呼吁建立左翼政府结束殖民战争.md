　　Xinhua News Agency, 18th: French President Coty has been busy for three days seeking ways to end the French government crisis.

　　On the 16th and 17th, he successively met with André Le Troquer, President of the National Assembly, Abbé Droulon, Vice-President of the Council of the Republic, Albert Sarraut, President of the French Federal Assembly, and leaders of various political parties from the Communist Party to the extreme right-wing Poujadists. On the 18th, he will also consult with some people who have served as Prime Minister, including the just-resigned Félix Gaillard. The purpose of this series of meetings and consultations is to find a suitable candidate to form a government. However, no such candidate has been found so far.

　　Paris observers believe that finding a successor to Gaillard will likely be a long and difficult exploratory process. Because, at present, the French ruling group is more divided than ever before.

　　Taking advantage of the deep government crisis, right-wing politicians in France are clamoring for further amendments to the relatively democratic constitution, in order to strip and reduce the seats of the Communist Party, the representatives of the French people, in the parliament, and demanding that the Algerian war be intensified.

　　Some right-wing figures are even plotting to bring General de Gaulle to power. Michel Debré, the leader of de Gaulle's party, the Social Republicans, in the Council of the Republic, openly clamored that no one but de Gaulle could lead a government that "maintains national security."

　　In response to this situation, the Political Bureau of the Central Committee of the French Communist Party issued a statement calling for the establishment of a government by all left-wing parties to resolve the government crisis. The statement emphasized that the cabinet crisis is a direct consequence of the Algerian war, which determines the entire political situation in France.

　　The statement said that the colonial war in Algeria not only sheds the blood of the Algerian people, but also causes disaster to the French people, and plunges the country into bankruptcy and isolation. The colonial war policy also fosters fascism. At the same time, the disastrous consequences of this war policy and the increasingly strong resistance it encounters have deepened the internal divisions within the government and the government majority, finally leading to the collapse of the government.

　　In addition, the Algerian war has prepared the conditions for the United States to control the entire North Africa, just as it paved the way for it to control South Vietnam in the past.

　　The statement pointed out that the best way to resolve the cabinet crisis is for the left-wing majority that emerged in the 1956 general election to form a government. In this government, the Communist Party should take the responsibility of implementing the reform and peace program jointly advocated by Republicans.

　　The statement said that such a government can achieve peace in Algeria through negotiations. It can establish voluntary and beneficial relations between France and independent North African countries on the basis of equality of rights. This government will be able to implement policies of saving France, social progress, democracy and peace.

　　The French Communist Party reiterated its proposal to hold talks among left-wing parties in order to quickly find compromise solutions acceptable to all to peacefully resolve the Algerian issue and establish a government that the country has been waiting for.

　　At the same time, the Executive Bureau of the French General Confederation of Labor issued a communiqué after a meeting on the 16th, saying: The government that fell in France was a government that reduced the purchasing power of the working class, bombed Sakiet, and intensified the Algerian war, and this government seriously harmed trade union freedom.

　　The communiqué expressed opposition to implementing an aggravated disastrous policy in Algeria or using any reactionary methods to resolve the cabinet crisis.

### 法国政府危机深重　右翼叫嚷修改宪法  法共呼吁建立左翼政府结束殖民战争

    法国政府危机深重　右翼叫嚷修改宪法
    法共呼吁建立左翼政府结束殖民战争
    本报综合报道　据新华社18日讯：法国总统戈蒂三天来一直在为寻找结束法国政府危机的途径而奔忙。
    在16日和17日，他已经先后会见了国民议会议长安德烈·勒特罗盖、共和国参议院副议长阿伯·杜隆、法兰西联邦议会议长阿尔培·萨罗以及从共产党到极右翼的布热德分子等各政党的领袖。18日他还要同担任过总理职务的一些人，包括刚下台的盖伊阿在内，进行磋商。这一系列会见和磋商的目的，在于物色一个适当的人选出来组织政府。但是直到现在还没有能够找到这样的人选。
    巴黎观察家认为，要找到盖伊阿的继任人，恐怕要经过一个漫长而困难的探索过程。因为，目前法国统治集团内部比过去任何时候都分裂得更厉害。
    法国右翼政界人士趁政府危机深重，正在叫嚷要进一步修改比较民主的宪法，以便剥夺和减少法国人民的代表共产党在议会中的席位，并且要求加紧进行阿尔及利亚战争。
    某些右翼人士甚至已经在策划捧戴高乐将军上台。戴高乐的党羽——社会共和党在共和国参议院的党团领袖密契尔·德勃雷公开叫嚷说，除戴高乐外，没有别人能领导一个“维护全国安全的”政府。
    针对这种情况，法国共产党中央委员会政治局发表声明，要求由所有左翼党派建立一个政府，来解决政府危机。声明着重指出，内阁危机是决定法国整个政治局势的阿尔及利亚战争的直接后果。
    声明说，在阿尔及利亚进行的殖民战争不但使阿尔及利亚人流血，而且使法国人民蒙受灾难，使国家陷于破产和孤立。殖民战争政策还使法西斯主义滋长。同时，这个战争政策的灾难性后果和它所遭到的日益强烈的反抗，还使政府和政府多数派的内部分歧愈来愈深刻，终于导致政府的瓦解。
    此外，阿尔及利亚战争还为美国控制整个北非准备了条件，正如过去为它控制南越铺平道路一样。
    声明指出，解决内阁危机的最好办法，是由1956年大选中出现的左翼多数派组成一个政府，在这个政府里，共产党应当担负起实行共和人士所共同主张的革新和和平纲领的责任。
    声明说，这样的政府可以通过谈判来实现阿尔及利亚和平。它能够在权利平等的基础上建立法国同北非独立国家之间自愿的有益的关系。这个政府将能够很好地执行拯救法国、社会进步、民主和和平的政策。
    法国共产党重申，它建议举行左翼各党派的会谈，以便赶快寻找出大家都能接受的折衷方案来和平解决阿尔及利亚问题，并且建立一个全国等待已久的政府。
    与此同时，法国总工会执行局在16日开会以后发表了一项公报说：在法国倒台的政府是一个削减了工人阶级购买力的、轰炸萨基埃特的和加紧进行阿尔及利亚战争的政府，这个政府严重地损害了工会自由。
    公报表示反对在阿尔及利亚执行变本加厉的灾难性政策或用任何反动办法来解决内阁危机。
