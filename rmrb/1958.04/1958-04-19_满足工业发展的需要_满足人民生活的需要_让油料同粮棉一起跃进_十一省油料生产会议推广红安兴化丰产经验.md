Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 17th: The eleven-province oil crop production conference held in Hubei Province, began on the 8th and ended on the 16th. The conference decided to promote the high-yield peanut experience of Hongan County, and adopt various effective measures to fully exploit the potential for increasing oil crop production, and promote the leap forward of oil crop production together with grain and cotton.

At the beginning of the conference, the representatives visited the high-yield peanut fields in Hongan County, which greatly strengthened their confidence in developing oil crop production. The representatives unanimously believed that Hongan County, under natural conditions of soil and water conservancy that were not superior, achieved an average yield of 600 jin per mu of peanuts throughout the county. The main reason for this was that the leadership's work style was deeply rooted in reality, and they conscientiously summarized and promoted the advanced high-yield experience of the masses, making oil crop production an important component of the county's agricultural production.

The meeting held that in recent years, provinces have seen the emergence of high-yield oil crop areas such as Hongan County in Hubei and Xinghua County in Jiangsu, which have promoted the national oil crop production. Last year, the total output of the four major oil crops, including soybeans and peanuts, in the eleven provinces also increased by nearly 13 million dan compared to 1952. However, from a national perspective, the current oil crop yield still cannot meet the needs of industrial development and improving people's lives. Therefore, the meeting believed that the main directions for increasing oil crop production in the future are: actively increasing the unit area yield of oil crops, expanding the planting area of high-yield oil crops, vigorously developing wild oil crops and woody oil crops, and fully utilizing wasteland to plant scattered oil crops such as sunflowers and castor beans. The representatives from Hunan Province proposed that this year the province plans to reclaim 1.8 million mu of sandy wasteland in Dongting Lake, and sow 350,000 mu of rapeseed after autumn, ensuring that edible oil production will double in one year, transforming the province from an oil-deficient province into a self-sufficient region. Representatives from Jiangsu Province also mentioned that this year they plan to launch a mass movement to plant sunflowers and castor beans by utilizing vacant land such as sandy wasteland and field edges.

The meeting also requested that all localities pay attention to doing a good job in economic work to stimulate the production enthusiasm of farmers. The meeting believed that the decisive link in promoting a great leap forward in oil crop production is to strengthen leadership work, break various negative and conservative ideas, and mobilize the enthusiasm of the broad masses of farmers. All localities should implement division of labor among leaders, assign special personnel to be responsible, and each agricultural cooperative should also implement contract labor and output quotas, and strengthen the system of special personnel management.

This meeting was convened by the Ministry of Agriculture, opened in Hongan County on the 8th with a visit, visited Macheng County on the 9th, and moved to Wuhan City on the 10th to continue until its closing. Representatives from eleven provinces including Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Henan, Hebei, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Jiangsu, and Anhui participated in the meeting. Five units including the State Economic Commission, the State Planning Commission, the Second Ministry of Commerce, the Ministry of Food, and the Ministry of Light Industry also sent people to attend the meeting.

    满足工业发展的需要　满足人民生活的需要
    让油料同粮棉一起跃进
    十一省油料生产会议推广红安兴化丰产经验
    据新华社武汉17日电　在湖北省召开的十一省油料生产会议，从8日开始到16日结束。会议决定推广红安县的花生丰产经验，并采取各项有效措施，充分发挥油料的增产潜力，促进油料生产和粮、棉一起跃进。
    代表们在会议初期，参观了红安县的花生高额丰产地，大大加强了他们发展油料生产的信心。代表们一致认为，红安县在土壤、水利等自然条件并不优越的情况下，获得了全县花生平均每亩产六百斤的收成，主要原因是领导工作作风深入实际，认真总结和推广了群众的先进丰产经验，使油料生产成为全县农业生产的一个重要组成部分。
    会议认为，近年来各省都出现了像湖北红安县、江苏兴化县等油料高额丰产地区，推动了全国的油料生产。去年十一省的大豆、花生等四种主要油料作物总产量也比1952年增加近一千三百万担。但从全国来看，目前油料产量仍然不能满足发展工业和改善人民生活的需要。为此，会议认为，今后增产油料的主要方向是：积极提高油料作物的单位面积产量、扩大高产油料作物种植面积、大力发展野生油料和木本油料，并且充分利用荒废空地栽植向日葵、蓖麻等零星油料作物。湖南省代表提出，今年全省计划围垦洞庭湖沙荒地一百八十万亩，秋后播种三十五万亩油菜，保证一年后食油产量比原来增加一倍，使全省由缺油省变为自给自足地区。江苏省代表也提到今年计划利用沙荒滩地、田边地角等空地，开展种植向日葵和蓖麻的群众性运动。
    会议还要求各地注意作好经济工作，以刺激农民生产积极性。会议认为，促进油料大跃进的决定性环节是加强领导工作，打破各种消极保守思想，把广大农民的积极性发动起来。各地要实行领导分工，专人负责，各个农业社也要实行包工包产，加强专人管理制度。
    这次会议是农业部召开的，8日在红安县开幕并进行参观，9日到麻城县参观，10日移到武汉市继续举行直到闭幕。参加会议的有湖北、湖南、江西、河南、河北、山东、山西、陕西、甘肃、江苏、安徽十一个省，国家经济委员会、国家计划委员会、第二商业部、粮食部和轻工业部五个单位也派人出席了会议。
    哪种油料含油量高油料种类	一般含油量花生仁		40—50％油菜籽		38—40％芝　麻		45—55％大　豆		16—24％胡　麻		30—35％向日葵		35％左右蓖麻子		50％左右
