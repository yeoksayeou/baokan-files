Xinhua News Agency, Hong Kong, April 4th. Ambassador Ragab of the United Arab Republic to China said in Hong Kong on the 3rd that the relationship between China and the United Arab Republic is truly very friendly. When Egypt encountered aggression the year before last, the Chinese government and people supported the Egyptian people's struggle. This rapid response from the Chinese side has made the Arab people never forget it. Also, when Syria was threatened and the Chinese people rose up to support it, we had the same feeling.
	Ambassador Ragab was passing through Hong Kong on his way back home. He said when meeting with Hong Kong newspaper reporters on the 3rd that the trade and cultural relations between the United Arab Republic and China have greatly developed in recent years. He said: "This relationship is developing more and more, which shows that the spirit of the Bandung Conference has been truly realized."
	When talking about his impressions during his year and a half in China, Ambassador Ragab said: The extremely honest attitude of the Chinese people, their pride, hard work and patience, and the rapid progress of China's industry and agriculture, deeply moved him.

    拉加卜大使在香港盛赞中阿友谊
    新华社香港4日电　阿拉伯联合共和国驻中国大使拉加卜3日在香港说，中国和阿拉伯联合共和国的关系真是十分友好。当埃及前年遭遇侵略的时候，中国政府和人民支援埃及人民的斗争，中国方面这种迅速的反应，使得阿拉伯人民永远不忘。还有当叙利亚受到威胁、中国人民起来支援的时候，我们也有同样的感觉。
    拉加卜大使是在回国途中路过香港的。他3日在接见香港报纸记者时说，这几年来阿拉伯联合共和国与中国的贸易和文化关系有了很大的发展。他说：“这种关系越来越发展，表示万隆会议的精神已经真正地实现”。
    拉加卜大使在谈到他在中国一年半期间的印象时说：中国人民极度诚实的态度、他们的自豪、勤劳与耐心，以及中国工农业突飞猛进的情形，使他深为感动。
