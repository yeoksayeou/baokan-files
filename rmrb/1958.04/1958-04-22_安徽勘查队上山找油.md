The Anhui Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative is actively preparing to establish thirty-seven wild plant oil factories.

Thirty-five counties in Anhui Province are mountainous or semi-mountainous, and wild plant resources are very abundant. In order to ascertain the resources of wild plants, the Supply and Marketing Cooperative will conduct large-scale exploration work this year, requiring that it be clarified in one year and thoroughly investigated in two years. The Supply and Marketing Cooperative will organize five wild plant exploration teams to go to the mountains to conduct explorations, and will also hold widespread forums with old farmers, shepherds, and small vendors to collect information on wild plants. Supply and marketing cooperatives in various counties will also add small-scale chemical instruments to test the nature and uses of wild plants.
