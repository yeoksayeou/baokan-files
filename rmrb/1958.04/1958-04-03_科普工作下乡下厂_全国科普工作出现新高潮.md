    全国科普工作出现新高潮
    本报讯　目前，全国各地已经出现了科学技术普及工作的新高潮。
    自安徽省科普协会向全国各地科普组织提出倡议，开展社会主义竞赛后，在科普战线上形成了比干劲、比先进、学先进、赶先进的热潮。上海、浙江等地科普修订或提出了跃进指标。河北、湖北、广东、吉林、江苏、天津等地区的科普组织，今年要实现科普工作普遍“下厂、下车间、下工段、下农业社、下生产队”。
    现在，各地科普组织已经创造了许多有效的宣传形式。山东、山西、河南、江苏、四川等二十多个省科普协会已经决定同共青团、妇联等单位合作，在农村中建立一百多万个农业技术业余学校或夜校，系统地普及耕作技术、水利、肥料、绿化、除四害等科学知识。各地还准备大批举办中、小型科学技术展览、放映科学电影等工作。山东等部分科普协会已经建成或正在筹备建立科学技术宣传馆或试验馆。
