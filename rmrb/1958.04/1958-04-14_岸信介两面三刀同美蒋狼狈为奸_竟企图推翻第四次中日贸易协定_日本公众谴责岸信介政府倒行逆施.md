Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, disregarding the urgent demands of the vast Japanese people and business community, is colluding with the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, openly adopting two-faced tactics in an attempt to overturn the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

On the afternoon of April 9th, Nobusuke Kishi handed the Japanese government's response to the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement to Masanosuke Ikeda, the representative of the three Japanese groups that signed the trade agreement with the Chinese side. In its brief reply, the Japanese government vaguely stated that it would "respect" the spirit of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. The reply also equivocally stated that the Japanese government would provide "support and assistance" to the agreement within the scope of various domestic laws and regulations, while also taking into account the fact that it does not recognize the Chinese government and considering current international relations.

After the reply was issued, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Aiichi Kiichi immediately issued a statement explaining the reply, further exposing that the Japanese government's words of "respect," "support," and "assistance" for the Sino-Japanese trade agreement in its reply were deceptive. Aichi emphasized that the Japanese government has no intention of recognizing China at present, implying that the Japanese government has no intention of providing guarantees for the safety and work convenience of the Chinese business representative offices. Aichi also publicly stated that the Japanese government cannot recognize the right of Chinese business representative offices to fly the Chinese flag. Aichi revealed that the Japanese government is doing this to "respect" Japan's relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique and other international relations, and to ensure that it does not cause "misunderstandings that the establishment of business representative offices may imply de facto recognition (of China)."

The Japanese government's conspiracy to undermine the Sino-Japanese trade agreement is not limited to this. On the morning of April 9th, ShÅ« Itagaki, Director of the Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in response to a question from Socialist Party member Shichiro Hozumi in the Diet that the reason why the Japanese government could not express its agreement to the Sino-Japanese trade agreement was because "there are parts in the agreement that cannot be clearly agreed to, such as the intergovernmental payment agreement, long-term trade plans, the status of staff of business representative offices, and regulations regarding the right to fly the flag."

Nobusuke Kishi openly stated in response to questions that if an incident of defacing the Chinese flag occurs, China has no right to make any demands. He said that the act of defacing the Chinese flag will be handled according to Japanese domestic law and will only be considered as damage to "property." Kishi Nobusuke's absurd attitude of equating the solemn flag of the People's Republic of China with general "property" is a great insult to the dignity of the flag of the People's Republic of China and a deliberate attempt to condone the act of defacing the flag of the People's Republic of China. News revealed that the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has begun holding a series of meetings since the 10th to make arrangements for this matter. Police officials said that if "fanatics" attack the Chinese flag, it is impossible for him to be prosecuted under the provisions of Japanese criminal law regarding the protection of foreign flags, and only the criminal law on damaging "private property" can be invoked. News revealed that the Chiang Kai-shek clique is satisfied with this "subtle distinction." This "subtle distinction" is the beginning of making China "slightly humiliated," which is what the Chiang Kai-shek clique demanded. Japanese officials once spread the word that the Japanese government will "protect" the Chinese flag flown by the Chinese business representative offices according to domestic law. Kishi Nobusuke's words and the arrangements of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department reveal that the Japanese government is playing a sinister and vicious two-faced trick on this issue.

The Japanese government's reply and Aiichi Kiichi's talks were issued after the US government and a group of American congressmen who were hostile to the Chinese people put pressure on Japan, and after Japanese Ambassador to Taipei, Kensuke Horiuchi, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique held ten secret talks on the issue of undermining Sino-Japanese trade agreements. According to news from various sources, the Japanese government's conspiracy to collude with the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique to undermine Sino-Japanese trade agreements has even more ulterior motives. According to Kyodo News, the Japanese government has secretly assured the Chiang Kai-shek clique that the Japanese government will try its best to prevent the Chinese business representative offices from actually flying the Chinese flag. Kyodo News said that the Japanese government meant that after the Japanese election, when China establishes business representative offices, if the three Japanese groups that signed the Sino-Japanese trade agreement cannot negotiate with the Chinese side, the Japanese government will directly negotiate with China to "try to prevent the actual hanging of the flag." After the Japanese government's reply and Aiichi Kiichi's talks were issued, Kensuke Horiuchi and the Chiang Kai-shek clique held their eleventh meeting on the evening of April 9th, announcing that the two sides had "reached an agreement." The Chiang Kai-shek clique's "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" also issued a statement late that night, saying that the Japanese and Chiang sides had "further understanding" of each other's positions, and urged the Japanese government to "implement in a timely manner" the points in the Japanese government's reply and Aiichi Kiichi's talks involving the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

According to Kyodo News, the reason why the Japanese government adopted the approach of "respecting" the Sino-Japanese trade agreement on the surface, while secretly assuring the Chiang Kai-shek clique to undermine it, is because: (1) If it clearly proposes a policy of prohibiting the hanging of the Chinese flag, China will oppose it, which will be detrimental to the Liberal Democratic Party's campaign in the election; (2) It cannot be determined that China will accept Japan's demands. From these two-faced practices of the Japanese government, it can be seen that it is cleverly trying to deceive the Chinese side and also deceive the Japanese people, and to reap political and economic capital from Sino-Japanese trade when the Japanese election is approaching; at the same time, it is also pleasing the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

Since taking office in February 1957, Nobusuke Kishi has consistently held a hostile attitude towards the Chinese people and has repeatedly publicly opposed the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. Before the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, Nobusuke Kishi had made various attempts to obstruct and undermine it. When the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement was finally signed on March 5th this year, people from all walks of life in Japan generally welcomed it, but Nobusuke Kishi said on the same day at the Budget Committee of the Senate that it was "inappropriate" to stipulate in the agreement that business representative offices have the right to fly the flag. He also stated that it would be "very difficult" for the Japanese government to recognize this agreement. After that, while Nobusuke Kishi delayed responding to the three Japanese groups, he colluded with the United States and Chiang Kai-shek to undermine the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

After Nobusuke Kishi's conspiracy to undermine the Sino-Japanese trade agreement was exposed, it was immediately criticized by the Japanese public. The "National Movement Implementation Committee for the Immediate Conclusion of the Fourth Japan-China Trade Agreement" held a meeting in Tokyo on April 10th with representatives from thirty-two groups and celebrities from all walks of life. The meeting decided to point out in the written request submitted to the three Japanese groups that the Japanese government's attitude was unfriendly to China and was actually undermining the Sino-Japanese trade agreement. Kazuo Suzuki, executive director of the Japan-China Trade Association, pointed out on the 11th that Aiichi Kiichi's speech made us have to suspect that this was a joint statement between the Japanese government and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. He demanded that the Japanese government take a clear stand so that the Sino-Japanese trade agreement could be fully realized. Eiichi Shukutani, chairman of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition, who had just returned to Tokyo from China on the 10th, also expressed dissatisfaction with the Japanese government's attitude, and he also believed that the Chinese side could not agree to this situation.

The Japanese Socialist Party has already issued a statement on the 10th, stating that it cannot agree to Aiichi Kiichi's talks. Kanichi Kawakami, a member of the Diet of the Japanese Communist Party and a former member of the Japanese Trade Delegation to China, accused the Japanese government of effectively rejecting the Sino-Japanese trade agreement at a rally held in Osaka on the 10th. He called on the Japanese people to step up their efforts to urge the Japanese government to unconditionally agree to the Sino-Japanese trade agreement.

The Chinese government and people have always adopted a positive attitude towards supporting the previous Sino-Japanese trade agreements, and at the same time, they are also alert to the Japanese government's destructive attitude. After Nobusuke Kishi recently wrote a letter to Chiang Kai-shek to assure him of his hostility to the Chinese people and his preparations to undermine the Sino-Japanese trade agreement, Chinese public opinion warned Nobusuke Kishi, stating that the Chinese people cannot tolerate his sabotage. Now that the Nobusuke Kishi government is attempting to overturn the Sino-Japanese trade agreement, if this attempt succeeds, it must be responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom.
