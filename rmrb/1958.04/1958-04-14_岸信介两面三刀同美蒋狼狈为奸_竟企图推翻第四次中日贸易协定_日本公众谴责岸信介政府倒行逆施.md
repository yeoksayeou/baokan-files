Xinhua News Agency, Tokyo, 13th: Japanese Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi, disregarding the urgent demands of the vast Japanese people and business community, is colluding with the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique, openly adopting two-faced tactics in an attempt to overturn the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

On the afternoon of April 9th, Nobusuke Kishi handed the Japanese government's response to the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement to Masanosuke Ikeda, the representative of the three Japanese groups that signed the trade agreement with the Chinese side. In its brief reply, the Japanese government vaguely stated that it would "respect" the spirit of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. The reply also equivocally stated that the Japanese government would provide "support and assistance" to the agreement within the scope of various domestic laws and regulations, while also taking into account the fact that it does not recognize the Chinese government and considering current international relations.

After the reply was issued, Japanese Chief Cabinet Secretary Aiichi Kiichi immediately issued a statement explaining the reply, further exposing that the Japanese government's words of "respect," "support," and "assistance" for the Sino-Japanese trade agreement in its reply were deceptive. Aichi emphasized that the Japanese government has no intention of recognizing China at present, implying that the Japanese government has no intention of providing guarantees for the safety and work convenience of the Chinese business representative offices. Aichi also publicly stated that the Japanese government cannot recognize the right of Chinese business representative offices to fly the Chinese flag. Aichi revealed that the Japanese government is doing this to "respect" Japan's relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique and other international relations, and to ensure that it does not cause "misunderstandings that the establishment of business representative offices may imply de facto recognition (of China)."

The Japanese government's conspiracy to undermine the Sino-Japanese trade agreement is not limited to this. On the morning of April 9th, Shū Itagaki, Director of the Asian Bureau of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, said in response to a question from Socialist Party member Shichiro Hozumi in the Diet that the reason why the Japanese government could not express its agreement to the Sino-Japanese trade agreement was because "there are parts in the agreement that cannot be clearly agreed to, such as the intergovernmental payment agreement, long-term trade plans, the status of staff of business representative offices, and regulations regarding the right to fly the flag."

Nobusuke Kishi openly stated in response to questions that if an incident of defacing the Chinese flag occurs, China has no right to make any demands. He said that the act of defacing the Chinese flag will be handled according to Japanese domestic law and will only be considered as damage to "property." Kishi Nobusuke's absurd attitude of equating the solemn flag of the People's Republic of China with general "property" is a great insult to the dignity of the flag of the People's Republic of China and a deliberate attempt to condone the act of defacing the flag of the People's Republic of China. News revealed that the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department has begun holding a series of meetings since the 10th to make arrangements for this matter. Police officials said that if "fanatics" attack the Chinese flag, it is impossible for him to be prosecuted under the provisions of Japanese criminal law regarding the protection of foreign flags, and only the criminal law on damaging "private property" can be invoked. News revealed that the Chiang Kai-shek clique is satisfied with this "subtle distinction." This "subtle distinction" is the beginning of making China "slightly humiliated," which is what the Chiang Kai-shek clique demanded. Japanese officials once spread the word that the Japanese government will "protect" the Chinese flag flown by the Chinese business representative offices according to domestic law. Kishi Nobusuke's words and the arrangements of the Tokyo Metropolitan Police Department reveal that the Japanese government is playing a sinister and vicious two-faced trick on this issue.

The Japanese government's reply and Aiichi Kiichi's talks were issued after the US government and a group of American congressmen who were hostile to the Chinese people put pressure on Japan, and after Japanese Ambassador to Taipei, Kensuke Horiuchi, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique held ten secret talks on the issue of undermining Sino-Japanese trade agreements. According to news from various sources, the Japanese government's conspiracy to collude with the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique to undermine Sino-Japanese trade agreements has even more ulterior motives. According to Kyodo News, the Japanese government has secretly assured the Chiang Kai-shek clique that the Japanese government will try its best to prevent the Chinese business representative offices from actually flying the Chinese flag. Kyodo News said that the Japanese government meant that after the Japanese election, when China establishes business representative offices, if the three Japanese groups that signed the Sino-Japanese trade agreement cannot negotiate with the Chinese side, the Japanese government will directly negotiate with China to "try to prevent the actual hanging of the flag." After the Japanese government's reply and Aiichi Kiichi's talks were issued, Kensuke Horiuchi and the Chiang Kai-shek clique held their eleventh meeting on the evening of April 9th, announcing that the two sides had "reached an agreement." The Chiang Kai-shek clique's "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" also issued a statement late that night, saying that the Japanese and Chiang sides had "further understanding" of each other's positions, and urged the Japanese government to "implement in a timely manner" the points in the Japanese government's reply and Aiichi Kiichi's talks involving the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

According to Kyodo News, the reason why the Japanese government adopted the approach of "respecting" the Sino-Japanese trade agreement on the surface, while secretly assuring the Chiang Kai-shek clique to undermine it, is because: (1) If it clearly proposes a policy of prohibiting the hanging of the Chinese flag, China will oppose it, which will be detrimental to the Liberal Democratic Party's campaign in the election; (2) It cannot be determined that China will accept Japan's demands. From these two-faced practices of the Japanese government, it can be seen that it is cleverly trying to deceive the Chinese side and also deceive the Japanese people, and to reap political and economic capital from Sino-Japanese trade when the Japanese election is approaching; at the same time, it is also pleasing the United States and the Chiang Kai-shek clique.

Since taking office in February 1957, Nobusuke Kishi has consistently held a hostile attitude towards the Chinese people and has repeatedly publicly opposed the normalization of Sino-Japanese relations. Before the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, Nobusuke Kishi had made various attempts to obstruct and undermine it. When the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement was finally signed on March 5th this year, people from all walks of life in Japan generally welcomed it, but Nobusuke Kishi said on the same day at the Budget Committee of the Senate that it was "inappropriate" to stipulate in the agreement that business representative offices have the right to fly the flag. He also stated that it would be "very difficult" for the Japanese government to recognize this agreement. After that, while Nobusuke Kishi delayed responding to the three Japanese groups, he colluded with the United States and Chiang Kai-shek to undermine the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.

After Nobusuke Kishi's conspiracy to undermine the Sino-Japanese trade agreement was exposed, it was immediately criticized by the Japanese public. The "National Movement Implementation Committee for the Immediate Conclusion of the Fourth Japan-China Trade Agreement" held a meeting in Tokyo on April 10th with representatives from thirty-two groups and celebrities from all walks of life. The meeting decided to point out in the written request submitted to the three Japanese groups that the Japanese government's attitude was unfriendly to China and was actually undermining the Sino-Japanese trade agreement. Kazuo Suzuki, executive director of the Japan-China Trade Association, pointed out on the 11th that Aiichi Kiichi's speech made us have to suspect that this was a joint statement between the Japanese government and the Chiang Kai-shek clique. He demanded that the Japanese government take a clear stand so that the Sino-Japanese trade agreement could be fully realized. Eiichi Shukutani, chairman of the Japanese Commodity Exhibition, who had just returned to Tokyo from China on the 10th, also expressed dissatisfaction with the Japanese government's attitude, and he also believed that the Chinese side could not agree to this situation.

The Japanese Socialist Party has already issued a statement on the 10th, stating that it cannot agree to Aiichi Kiichi's talks. Kanichi Kawakami, a member of the Diet of the Japanese Communist Party and a former member of the Japanese Trade Delegation to China, accused the Japanese government of effectively rejecting the Sino-Japanese trade agreement at a rally held in Osaka on the 10th. He called on the Japanese people to step up their efforts to urge the Japanese government to unconditionally agree to the Sino-Japanese trade agreement.

The Chinese government and people have always adopted a positive attitude towards supporting the previous Sino-Japanese trade agreements, and at the same time, they are also alert to the Japanese government's destructive attitude. After Nobusuke Kishi recently wrote a letter to Chiang Kai-shek to assure him of his hostility to the Chinese people and his preparations to undermine the Sino-Japanese trade agreement, Chinese public opinion warned Nobusuke Kishi, stating that the Chinese people cannot tolerate his sabotage. Now that the Nobusuke Kishi government is attempting to overturn the Sino-Japanese trade agreement, if this attempt succeeds, it must be responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom.

    岸信介两面三刀同美蒋狼狈为奸
    竟企图推翻第四次中日贸易协定
    日本公众谴责岸信介政府倒行逆施
    新华社13日讯  东京消息：日本首相岸信介不顾日本广大人民和工商界的迫切要求，与美国和蒋介石集团狼狈为奸，公然采取两面三刀的手法企图推翻第四次中日贸易协定。
    岸信介在4月9日下午把日本政府关于第四次中日贸易协定的答复交给同中国方面签订贸易协定的日本三个团体的代表池田正之辅。日本政府在他的简短的答复中泛泛地说，日本政府将“尊重”第四次中日贸易协定的精神。答复中并且闪烁其词地说，日本政府将在日本国内各项法令的范围内，同时根据没有承认中国政府这个事实，还考虑到目前的国际关系，对这个协定给予“支持和协助”。
    在这个答复发表之后，日本政府官房长官爱知揆一随即发表谈话，对这个答复作了说明，进一步暴露出日本政府在它的答复中所表示的将“尊重”、“支持”和“协助”中日贸易协定的话是骗人的。爱知强调说明，日本政府现在无意承认中国，言外之意就是日本政府对于中国商务代表机构的安全和工作便利，无意提供保证。爱知还公开声明，日本政府不能承认中国商务代表机构有权悬挂中国国旗。爱知透露，日本政府这样做，是为了“尊重”日本同蒋介石集团的关系和其他国际关系，并且考虑到务必不引起“商务代表机构的设立可能意味着事实上承认（中国）”的“误会”。
    日本政府破坏中日贸易协定的阴谋还不只是这些。外务省亚洲局局长板垣修4月9日上午在国会答复社会党议员穗积七郎的质询时说，日本政府所以不能表示同意中日贸易协定、是因为“在协定里面有不能明确表示同意的部分，例如关于政府之间的支付协定、长期贸易计划、商务代表机构工作人员的身份以及关于有权悬挂国旗的规定。”
    岸信介在答复质询时公然表示，如果发生破坏中国国旗的事情，中国没有权利提出任何要求。他说，对中国国旗的破坏行为将根据日本国内法律来处理，并且将只作为对“财产”的破坏来考虑。岸信介把庄严的中华人民共和国国旗和一般“财产”相提并论的荒谬态度，是对中华人民共和国国旗的尊严的莫大侮辱，也是蓄谋放纵破坏中华人民共和国国旗的行为。有消息透露，东京警视厅已经从10日开始召开一系列的会议，就这件事进行布置。警视厅人士表示，如果有“狂热分子”攻击中国国旗，他是不可能因此而遭到根据日本刑法关于保护外国国旗的规定对他的控诉，将只可能援用损害“私人财产”的刑律。消息透露，蒋介石集团对这种“巧妙区别”是感到满意的。这种“巧妙区别”是使中国“稍受屈辱”的开端，这种开端是蒋介石集团所要求的。日本官方人士曾经散布空气说，日本政府将根据国内法律“保护”中国商务代表机构悬挂的中国国旗。岸信介的话和东京警视厅的布置暴露出日本政府在这个问题上是在耍弄如何阴险恶毒的两面手法。
    日本政府的答复和爱知揆一的谈话，是在美国政府和一批敌视中国人民的美国议员对日本施加压力以及日本驻台北“大使”堀内谦介和蒋介石集团就破坏中日贸易协定问题举行了十次秘密会谈之后发表的。据各方面传出来的消息，日本政府勾结美国和蒋介石集团破坏中日贸易协定的阴谋，还有更加不可告人的黑幕。据共同社报道，日本政府已经向蒋介石集团秘密保证，日本政府将努力在实际上不让中国商务代表机构悬挂中国国旗。共同社说，日本政府的意思是：在日本大选结束以后，中国设立商务代表机构的时候，如果签订中日贸易协定的日本三个团体不能同中国方面进行交涉，就由日本政府直接同中国谈判，“努力促使在实际上不悬挂国旗”。在日本政府的答复和爱知揆一的谈话发表以后，堀内谦介和蒋介石集团在4月9日晚间举行了第十一次会谈，宣告双方“获致协议”。蒋介石集团“外交部”并且在当天深夜发表公报说，日蒋双方对于彼此所持的立场已经获得“进一步的了解”，公报并且催促日本政府对日本政府的答复和爱知揆一的谈话中涉及蒋介石集团的各点“及时付诸实施”。
    据共同社透露，日本政府所以采取在表面上“尊重”中日贸易协定、在背地里又向蒋介石集团保证加以破坏的做法，是因为：（一）如果明确提出禁止悬挂中国国旗的方针，中国就会反对，就会不利于自由民主党在大选中的竞选；（二）不能断定中国会接受日本的要求。从日本政府的这些两面三刀的做法中可以看出，它自作聪明地想既使中国方面上当，又可欺骗日本人民，在日本大选临近的时候从中日贸易中捞一把政治和经济资本；同时还讨好了美国和蒋介石集团。
    岸信介自从1957年2月上台以来，一贯对中国人民抱敌视态度，并且屡次三番公开反对中日关系的正常化。在第四次中日贸易协定签订以前，岸信介曾经多方进行阻挠和破坏。当第四次中日贸易协定终于在今年3月5日签订的时候，日本各界人士普遍表示欢迎，岸信介当天却在参议院预算委员会上说，在这个协定中规定商务代表机构有权悬挂国旗，是“不适当”的。他并且表示，日本政府要承认这个协定是“非常困难”的。其后，岸信介一方面拖延对日本三个团体作出答复，另一方面却同美国和蒋介石勾勾搭搭，一起破坏第四次中日贸易协定。
    岸信介破坏中日贸易协定的阴谋暴露以后，立即遭到日本公众的指责。“立即缔结第四次日中贸易协定国民运动实行委员会”4月10日在东京举行了有三十二个团体的代表和各界名流参加的会议。会议决定向日本的三个团体提出的书面要求中指出，日本政府的态度是对中国不友好的，而且是在实际上破坏中日贸易协定。中日贸易会专务理事铃木一雄11日指出，爱知揆一的讲话，使我们不得不怀疑，这是日本政府同蒋介石集团的联合声明。他要求日本政府采取明确的立场，使中日贸易协定得以完全实现。刚在10日从中国回到东京的日本商品展览会理事长宿谷荣一也对日本政府的态度表示不满，他并且认为，这种情况也是中国方面不能同意的。
    日本社会党已经在10日发表声明，表示不能同意爱知揆一的谈话。前日本访华通商使节团团员、日本共产党国会议员川上贯一10日在大阪举行的一次集会上指责日本政府事实上拒绝了中日贸易协定。他号召日本人民加紧努力，促使日本政府无条件地同意中日贸易协定。
    中国政府和人民对历次中日贸易协定都采取积极支持的态度，同时，也警觉到日本政府的破坏态度。在最近岸信介写信向蒋介石保证与中国人民为敌和准备破坏中日贸易协定之后，中国舆论已经向岸信介提过警告，表示中国人民不能容忍他的破坏。现在岸信介政府企图推翻中日贸易协定，如果这一企图得逞，它必须对由此而产生的一切后果负责。
