Contributing manpower and materials: People of the capital support suburban farmers in fighting drought

(Our newspaper reports) The people of the capital are vigorously supporting suburban farmers in fighting drought and planting crops by providing manpower and materials. According to incomplete statistics, on the 22nd and 23rd, more than 21,000 cadres, workers, students, shop assistants, People's Liberation Army officers and soldiers, and street residents volunteered to participate in the fight against drought in the suburbs.

Since the beginning of spring, there has been no thorough rain in the suburbs of Beijing. Of the more than four million mu of spring-sown land, more than 1.56 million mu are difficult to sow due to drought. The vast number of farmers and cadres in the suburbs have been working day and night to combat drought and plant crops. However, due to the short sowing time, a large number of laborers are urgently needed to provide support. The Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China has therefore decided to mobilize the people of the city to support suburban farmers in fighting drought and planting crops.

The people of the city warmly responded to this call. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Commerce, and other departments voluntarily requested to send manpower to support spring planting by farmers. More than half of the cadres of the Beijing Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative signed up to participate in the fight against drought. More than 400 street residents from Chaoyangmenwai Street, Xiaotianshuijing and Chunshu Hutong three street offices in Dongdan District, who had never gone out of the city to participate in labor, also actively requested to help the farmer brothers to fight drought. They set off yesterday to the Heping Township Agricultural Production Cooperative in the eastern suburbs and were warmly welcomed by the farmers.

Many units are trying every means to allocate materials to support the fight against drought. In the past three days, eighteen units have allocated more than 3,000 pieces of anti-drought machinery and equipment, including automobiles, sprinklers, water pumps, diesel engines, water buckets, and pipes. These materials will be successively transported to the countryside starting today. (Attached picture)

    要人出人　要物资出物资
    首都人民支援郊区农民抗旱
    本报讯　有人出人，有物资出物资，首都人民大力支援郊区农民抗旱播种。据不完全的统计，22、23两日有两万一千多名干部、工人、学生、店员、解放军官兵和街道居民，自愿到郊区参加抗旱斗争。
    入春以来，北京郊区没有下过透雨。四百多万亩春播地中，有一百五十六万多亩因干旱难以播种，郊区广大农民和干部夜以继日地投入了抗旱播种的战斗。但因播种时间短促，迫切需要大批劳动力支援。中共北京市委为此决定动员全市人民支援郊区农民抗旱播种。
    全市人民热烈响应这个号召，外交部、商业部等自动要求抽调人力支援农民春播。北京市供销合作社半数以上的干部报名参加抗旱。东单区朝阳门外大街、小甜水井和椿树胡同三个街道办事处的从未出城参加过劳动的四百多街道居民，也积极要求帮助农民兄弟抗旱，她们已在昨天出发到东郊区和平乡农业生产合作社，受到农民的热烈欢迎。
    很多单位都在想尽一切办法抽调物资支援抗旱，最近三天内已有十八个单位抽调出汽车、洒水车、水泵、柴油机、水桶、管子等各种抗旱机具三千多件。这些物资今日起即陆续运往农村。（附图片）
