North Korea Expands Cotton Field Area
    All Using Nutrient Pot Transplanting Method
    (People's Daily News) Agricultural cooperative members in North Korea have unanimously resolved to overfulfill this year's cotton production plan by more than 14,000 tons, producing a total of more than 54,000 tons, to supply the textile industry with more fiber raw materials. They are now, according to the principle of adapting to local conditions, expanding the cotton planting area to more than 50,000 chōbu (one chōbu is equivalent to 15 Chinese mu), and have made preparations to use the nutrient pot transplanting method in all of the more than 50,000 chōbu of cotton fields.
    Various factories are actively supporting farmers' cotton production increase movement. The Giyang Agricultural Machinery Factory manufactured a nutrient pot manufacturing machine that can produce 100,000 nutrient pots a day.
    In North Korea, cotton farmers have greatly increased cotton yields by using the nutrient pot transplanting method. For example, the Sangyang Agricultural Cooperative in Sunan County, South Pyongan Province, harvested 4,130 kilograms of cotton per chōbu last year, which is more than twice the amount of the direct sowing method. This year, this cooperative plans to use the nutrient pot transplanting method in all cotton fields, and it is expected to achieve a yield of 7,000 catties per chōbu.

    朝鲜扩大棉田面积
    全部使用营养坛假植法
    本报讯　朝鲜各地农业社社员们，一致决心在今年要超计划增产一万四千多吨棉花，共生产五万四千多吨，为纺织工业供应更多的纤维原料。他们正在根据因地制宜的原则，要把棉花种植面积扩大到五万町步（每町步合我国十五市亩）以上，并已做好在五万多町步棉田全部采用营养坛假植法的准备工作。
    各工厂正在积极支援农民的棉花增产运动。岐阳农业机器厂，制造了一天能制造十万个营养坛的营养坛制造机。
    在朝鲜，棉农使用营养坛假植法，大大提高了棉花产量。例如，平安南道顺安郡上阳农业社去年每町步收获棉花达四千一百三十公斤，等于直播法的二倍以上。今年这个社准备全部棉田都采用营养坛假植法，预计使每町步的收获量达到七千斤。
