    Wang Yongshou's Battle with the Golden Leopard
    Huang Qizhi
    On March 21st, a golden leopard was discovered in Cizhu Township, Jiangbei County, Sichuan Province. Commune member Wang Yongshou (a veteran soldier) shouldered his gun and, along with other commune members, tracked and searched for it, finally locating the beast near a slanting cliff. Seeing people chasing it, the leopard roared and leaped up the roughly three-zhang-high (ten meters) cliff, knocking down commune member Li Shengan. Li Shengan's brother, Li Maosheng, rushed forward to rescue him and was also clawed and fell. Seeing the leopard's ferocity, the other pursuers retreated. At this critical moment, Wang Yongshou stepped forward and fired at the leopard. Unexpectedly, the gun misfired. The leopard turned its head, roared loudly, and bared its fangs and claws as it pounced on Wang Yongshou. As the leopard attacked, Wang Yongshou used all his strength to hold it off with the gun barrel, then with a horizontal thrust, he knocked the leopard to the ground. Following this, Wang Yongshou struck the leopard's head with the butt of his gun, hitting the ferocious beast so hard it could not withstand the blows. It then fled in a disheveled manner, wounded. Wang Yongshou was not willing to let it go and chased it to a stone cave, where he discovered the leopard hiding inside. He fired eight shots in succession. At this time, other commune members also came to support him, and finally, they killed this fierce wild beast.

    王永寿大战金钱豹
    黄启直
    3月21日，四川省江北县茨竹乡发现了一只金钱大豹。社员王永寿（转业军人）背上枪，同其他社员跟踪搜索，追到一个斜岩，才发现这只猛兽。大豹见有人追来，狂叫一声，纵上高约三丈的斜岩将社员李胜安扑倒，李胜安的哥哥李茂胜向前抢救，也被抓伤跌倒。其他追寻的人见大豹如此凶猛，纷纷后退。正在这紧急关头，王永寿抢步上前，向大豹射击。那知枪机失灵，大豹回过头来大声咆哮，张牙舞爪地向王永寿扑过来。王永寿乘大豹扑来的时候，使尽全力用枪筒将大豹顶住，横起一挑，就将大豹挑翻在地。接着，王永寿又用枪托朝大豹头上打去，打得这个凶兽招架不住，它才带着伤，狼狈地逃窜了。王永寿那里肯放，追至一个石洞，发现大豹躲在里面，他接连开了八枪，这时其他社员也跟上来支援，最后就把这只凶猛的野兽杀死了。
