Xinhua News Agency, 13th. The Chinese Red Cross Society announced today that starting in mid-April, it will assist approximately 2,000 Japanese nationals in China who voluntarily wish to return to Japan, in batches. The Japanese repatriation ship "Hakusan Maru" is expected to arrive in Tanggu for the first time on April 15th. Since 1953, with the cooperation of the Chinese Red Cross Society, the Japanese Red Cross Society, the Japan-China Friendship Society, and the Japan Peace Liaison Committee, more than 30,000 Japanese nationals in China have returned to Japan.

According to the Chinese Red Cross Society, as early as September 1957, the Chinese Red Cross Society notified the Japanese side to send a ship to repatriate the eight Japanese war criminals who were released ahead of schedule or upon completion of their sentences, as well as the Japanese nationals who applied to return to their country and Japanese women who wanted to visit relatives in Japan at that time. However, the Japanese government was unwilling to have the women visiting relatives return to Japan and insisted that they pay half of the ship fare themselves. Despite the efforts of the three Japanese organizations, they refused to send a ship. As a result, the Japanese war criminals who were released last year have been waiting in Tianjin for eight months to board the ship back to their country, and the number of Japanese nationals applying to return to their country has continued to increase. They are all eager to return to their country as soon as possible. In order to satisfy their reasonable and sympathetic wishes, the Chinese Red Cross Society took the initiative to notify the Japanese side to first send a ship to repatriate the Japanese nationals and war criminals, and the issue of women visiting relatives would be left to the representatives of the three Japanese organizations to continue to discuss and resolve after they arrive in China with the ship.

Currently, approximately 2,000 Japanese nationals have applied to return to their country, but the "Hakusan Maru" sent by the Japanese side can only accommodate 400 people. The Chinese Red Cross Society will assist them in returning to their country in batches.

### 中国红十字会积极协助妥善安排  二千名日侨将分批回国

    中国红十字会积极协助妥善安排
    二千名日侨将分批回国
    新华社13日讯　中国红十字会今天宣布，从本月中旬起，该会又将协助约二千名自愿回国的在中国的日本侨民分批回日本。日本接侨船“白山丸”预计将在4月15日第一次到达塘沽。自从1953年以来，在中国红十字会与日本红十字会、日中友好协会和日本和平联络会三团体合作下，已有三万余名在华日侨回到日本。
    据中国红十字会称，早在1957年9月，中国红十字会就通知日本方面派船来接运被提前或期满释放的八名日本战争犯罪分子和当时提出申请的回国日侨和回日探亲的日本妇女，但是日本政府不愿探亲妇女回国，坚持要她们自付一半船费，虽经日本三团体多方努力，一直拒绝派船。以致去年被释放的日本战争犯罪分子在天津候船回国已达八个月，而申请回国的日侨也续有增加，他们都迫切要求早日回国。为满足她们这种合理的和值得同情的愿望，中国红十字会又主动通知日本方面先派船来接运回国日侨和战犯，探亲妇女问题留待日本三团体随船代表到中国后继续商谈解决。
    目前申请回国的日侨已达二千人左右，而日本方面派来的接侨船“白山丸”只能容纳四百人。中国红十字会将协助他们分批回国。
