Brotherly Countries' Cultural Life

    Georgian Arts Decade
    On the evening of March 21st in Moscow, the Bolshoi Theatre fell silent after a burst of enthusiastic applause. The heavy curtain on the stage slowly rose, revealing a landscape of southern Soviet Union, with the snow-covered Caucasus Mountains setting off an ancient castle, and the rich southern music making people feel refreshed. Thus, the Georgian Republic began its grand performance of the Arts Decade with its famous classical opera "Twilight."

    On the same evening, in various theaters in Moscow, the working people of Moscow and guests who came specifically from various republics enjoyed the Georgian Republic's dramas.

    The Georgian Arts Decade held in Moscow is a comprehensive review of the development of literature and art in the Georgian Republic. During the Arts Decade, Georgian art troupes screened their own films in Moscow cinemas, and performed wonderful programs such as operas, ballets, dramas, song and dance, and acrobatics in theaters, cultural palaces, and factory clubs. The ballet "Othello" performed by the Tbilisi Opera and Ballet Theatre was a great success.

    During the Arts Decade, writers and poets from various Soviet republics also gathered to warmly celebrate the literary achievements of Georgia. Literary figures from fraternal ethnic groups discussed modern Georgian prose, put forward valuable suggestions, and Georgian writers also went to factories to meet with the working masses.

    The "Georgian and Russian Cultural Exchange" exhibition was held at the Moscow Museum of Oriental Culture. At the same time, a large-scale exhibition of Soviet Georgian fine arts also opened in the hall of the Soviet Academy of Arts. The thousands of paintings, sculptures, pottery and other works of art displayed at the exhibition comprehensively and profoundly reflected the brilliant achievements of Georgian fine arts in the Soviet era.

    During the Arts Decade, people flocked to the State Lenin Library. It turned out that a Georgian Book Exhibition was being held here. Visitors could see ancient manuscripts and the first batch of Georgian printed books in the glass cabinets. A section of the exhibition was dedicated to Shota Rustaveli and his world-famous masterpiece "The Knight in the Panther's Skin." In the era of Soviet power, the Georgian Republic published 43,000 kinds of books, with a circulation of 188.8 million copies.

    In the Soviet Union, it has become a tradition for various republics and autonomous republics to take turns holding Arts Decades in Moscow. Through this form, literary and art workers from all fraternal ethnic groups in the Soviet Union can often gather together to exchange experience, learn from each other, encourage each other, and jointly promote the prosperity of Soviet literature and art. In recent years, the ties between literary and art groups in various parts of the Soviet Union have become closer. For example, the theater troupes of the three republics of Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia have held two "Baltic Drama Springs." The broad audience of the Soviet Union also excitedly welcomed the "Central Asian Drama Spring" and the "Volga River Drama Spring." Now, the three republics of Georgia, Azerbaijan, and Armenia are jointly preparing the Caucasus Spring Music Festival. The blossoming of literature and art of all nationalities in the Soviet Union once again proves the superiority of the Soviet system, which provides excellent conditions for literary and artistic creation.

### 格鲁吉亚文艺旬

    格鲁吉亚文艺旬
    3月21日的莫斯科夜晚，大剧院在一片热烈的掌声后突然变得鸦雀无声。舞台上的厚幕徐徐上升，露出了一片苏联南方的景色，白雪覆盖的高加索山衬托着古代的城堡，浓厚的南方情调的音乐使人心旷神怡。这样，格鲁吉亚共和国以自己的著名的古典歌剧“黄昏”开始了文艺旬的盛大表演。
    同一天晚上，在莫斯科各剧院，莫斯科的劳动人民和各加盟共和国特地前来的客人一起欣赏了格鲁吉亚共和国的话剧。
    在莫斯科举行的格鲁吉亚文艺旬，是格鲁吉亚共和国文学艺术发展的全面大检阅。在文艺旬期间，格鲁吉亚艺术团体在莫斯科各影院放映自己拍制的电影，在各剧院、文化宫和工厂俱乐部里演出歌剧、芭蕾舞、话剧、歌舞和杂技等精采节目。第比利斯歌舞剧院上演的芭蕾舞剧“奥赛罗”获得了很大的成功。
    在文艺旬期间，苏联各加盟共和国的作家和诗人也曾集聚一堂热烈地庆祝了格鲁吉亚的文学成就。各兄弟民族的文学家讨论了格鲁吉亚的现代散文，提出了宝贵的意见，格鲁吉亚的作家们也纷纷到工厂去同工人群众会见。
    在莫斯科东方文化博物馆里举行了“格鲁吉亚和俄罗斯文化交流”展览会。同时，一个规模宏大的苏维埃格鲁吉亚造型艺术展览会也在苏联艺术科学院的大厅里开幕了。展览会上陈列的千百件绘画、雕塑、陶器等艺术品，全面而深刻地反映了格鲁吉亚造型艺术在苏维埃政权时代取得的辉煌成就。
    文艺旬期间，到国立列宁图书馆的人川流不息。原来这里举行了格鲁吉亚书籍展览会。参观者在玻璃橱里可以看到古老的手稿和格鲁吉亚印刷的第一批书籍。展览会上有一部分专门介绍了卢斯塔维里和他的世界名著“虎皮骑士”。在苏维埃政权的年代里，格鲁吉亚共和国出版了四万三千种书，发行一亿八千八百万册。
    在苏联，各加盟共和国和自治共和国轮流在莫斯科举行文艺旬已成为传统。通过这种形式，苏联各兄弟民族的文艺工作者可以经常集聚一堂交流经验，互相观摩，互相砥砺，共同促进全苏文艺的繁荣。近年来，苏联各地文艺团体之间的联系更加密切了。例如，拉脱维亚、立陶宛和爱沙尼亚三个加盟共和国的剧团已经举行了两次“波罗的海戏剧之春”。苏联的广大观众也同样兴奋地迎接了“中亚细亚戏剧之春”和“伏尔加河戏剧之春”。现在，格鲁吉亚、阿塞拜疆和亚美尼亚三个共和国正在共同筹备高加索春季音乐节。苏联各民族的文学艺术的百花盛开，再一次证明了为文艺创作提供了优良条件的苏维埃制度的优越性。
