    "The Image of Communists in Soviet Literature"
    How to shape the image of heroic characters is a matter of concern in literary circles. This book explores the basic ways in which Soviet writers shaped the image of Communist Party members through the analysis of more important works in Soviet literature, such as "Mother," "The Iron Flood," "How the Steel Was Tempered," "The Young Guard," and "Happiness," as well as the exposition of major events in the various historical stages of the development of Soviet literature. It also points out the achievements they have made in this regard and the difficulties they have encountered.
