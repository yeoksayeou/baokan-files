	Stride Forward to Catch Up with Wuhan Steel
	The news that Wuhan Steel is striving to put its No. 1 blast furnace system into production ahead of schedule on this year's National Day, and that the five medium-sized blast furnaces in Ma'anshan will be completed and produce iron ahead of schedule, has inspired the builders of the Xiejiachi Central Coal Preparation Plant in Anhui, which supplies coking coal to these two units. The coal preparation plant was originally scheduled to be completed in July of next year, but now it can be handed over for production by the end of this year ahead of schedule.
	Currently, the construction workers are taking active measures such as steam curing with capillary tubes, non-stop cross-operation of multiple types of work, and multi-shift operation to accelerate the progress of the project and improve the quality of the project. (Wang Xiaobo)

    迈开步伐直追武钢
    武钢争取一号高炉系统提前在今年国庆节投入生产和马鞍山五座中型高炉将提前完工出铁的消息，鼓舞了供应这两个单位炼焦精煤的安徽谢家集中央选煤厂的建设者。这个选煤厂原计划明年7月建成，现在可提前在今年年底移交生产。
    目前，建设的人们正采取毛管蒸气养护、多工种不间歇的交叉作业、多班作业等积极措施，加快了工程进度和提高工程质量。	（王孝伯）
