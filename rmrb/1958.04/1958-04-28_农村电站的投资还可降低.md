    Investment in Rural Power Stations Can Still Be Reduced
    On March 19th, the People's Daily introduced news of a 240-kilowatt rural power station designed by the Beijing Design Institute of the Ministry of Water Resources and Electric Power. The article mentioned that it required an investment of 189,000 yuan. We believe that the investment in this power station is too high. Based on the current economic conditions in rural areas, not many can afford to spend 180,000 to 190,000 yuan to build a power station. In order to reduce the cost of power stations and make it easier for rural areas to build them, we suggest that the power equipment for the power station could use three 100-horsepower portable steam engines, plus generators and building construction, estimated to cost 70,000 yuan. In this way, the original investment of 180,000 to 190,000 yuan could build two to three power stations. We hope the Beijing Electric Power Design Institute will consider whether our suggestion is feasible.

    农村电站的投资还可降低
    3月19日，人民日报介绍了水利电力工业部北京设计院设计的发电二百四十瓩的农村电站的新闻，文中提到需要投资十八万九千元。我们认为这个电站的投资太高，根据当前农村的经济条件，能够花十八、九万元建筑电站的不太多。为了降低电站造价，使农村建起来不费力，我们建议电站的动力设备可采用三台一百马力锅驼机，再加上发电机与房屋建设，估计用七万元就可建成。这样，原来十八、九万元的投资可以建设二到三个发电站。我们的建议可否实行，希望北京电力设计院考虑。
