    "Ox-Powered Train"
    On April 1st, the Guangxi Daily published an interesting drawing on its front page: a person driving two oxen, with a long line of small carts behind them, looking like a train from a distance. This was an illustration for a news item titled "‘Ox-Powered Train’ Gallops Across Zhangcun Fields." The news said that after realizing transportation vehicle-ization, the Zhangcun Agricultural Cooperative in Shilong County recently created the "Ox-Powered Train." It is made up of five double-wheeled carts joined together. Because the load is distributed among the carts, the pressure on the wheels is reduced, making it easier to turn, which greatly increases the transport capacity of the carts. In half a day, an old-fashioned oxcart could pull 10,000 jin, while the "Ox-Powered Train" could pull 31,500 jin, increasing transportation efficiency by more than two times. Now, the Zhangcun Cooperative has fully promoted this "Ox-Powered Train" and is paying attention to repairing roads to facilitate the passage of the "train."

    A Problem Worthy of Attention
    A reader's letter published in the Anhui Daily on April 3rd raised a problem worthy of attention. The reader, Jing Zhi, reflected that in some agricultural cooperatives in Shouxian and Huoshan, the income of cooperative members from private side occupations exceeded their income from participating in collective production. The ratio between the two was four to six, or even three to seven in reverse. This has affected the development of collective production and the consolidation of the cooperative. At the same time as publishing this letter, the newspaper also published a news item reporting that the Chengjiao Agricultural Cooperative in Xueji Town, Funan County, through a major debate during cooperative rectification, formulated measures to appropriately restrict private side occupations, reversing the tendency of some members to only engage in private transportation and not work in agriculture, achieving the goal of "public first, private second, everyone happy." In a short commentary, the Anhui Daily affirmed the practice of the Chengjiao Cooperative, pointing out that the struggle between the two roads has not ended, and that individual side occupations of cooperative members should be appropriately restricted.

    "Experimental Plot" Institutionalized
    The Jiangxi Daily published on April 2nd the regulations of the Jiangxi Provincial People's Committee on the promotion of "experimental plots" and the rotation of labor training for cadres of provincial-level organizations. According to these regulations, all responsible cadres above the section chief level in provincial-level units must, without exception, determine a certain amount of land or a factory, a workshop, a store, a school... as their "experimental plot" according to the nature of their work, directly participate in labor, and participate in grassroots work to absorb experience and guide the overall work. The minimum amount of time each person spends on labor and work in the "experimental plot" shall not be less than one month per year. Specific regulations were also made for the rotation of provincial-level organization cadres to participate in labor training. These regulations will institutionalize the work of "experimental plots" and participation in labor training.

    Industrial Technology Army Marches to the Countryside
    Developing local industry is one of the current important tasks. Shanxi Province has transferred 470 technicians and technical personnel to county-run industries and handicraft production cooperatives in various counties to support the agricultural technology revolution. Among them are engineers, technicians, and technical personnel, as well as labor models and advanced producers. On April 2nd, the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China and the Provincial People's Committee held a conference to warmly welcome this group of pioneers who went to the countryside to develop industry. The Shanxi Daily published this news on the 3rd, and also published an editorial, calling it a revolutionary action of great significance.

    The Road to Happiness for the Happiness Cooperative
    The Sanxin Township in Mucuan County, Sichuan Province, has rolling hills and little farmland, with corn yields of only a little over 100 jin per mu. The Happiness Agricultural Cooperative in this township researched a "large cluster hole" planting method as early as 1956, and conducted experiments on 22 mu of land, resulting in an increase in yield to 350 to 450 jin per mu; in 1957, they conducted experiments on another 18 mu of land, and increased fertilizer application and improved cultivation techniques, resulting in an average yield of 600 jin per mu, with the highest reaching 750 jin. In the same year, some other cooperatives in this township also used the same method for experiments and obtained high yields. On March 31st, the Sichuan Daily reported this creation of the Happiness Cooperative on the front page, and introduced the specific practices of the "large cluster hole" in detail, which is a noteworthy initiative on the agricultural front.

    在各地报纸上
    “牛力火车”
    1日，广西日报一版发表了一幅有趣的图画：一个人赶着两头牛，牛的后面拉着一长列小车，远远望去就像一列火车。这是一条题为“‘牛力火车’奔驰樟村田野”的消息的插图。消息中说，石龙县樟村农业社在实现运输车子化以后，最近又创造了“牛力火车”。它是用五架双轮小车联合成的，由于载重量分散在各个小车上，车轮压力减轻，容易转动，就大大增加了车子的运输量。半天时间，老式牛车能拉一万斤，“牛力火车”却能拉三万一千五百斤，运输效率提高两倍多。现在，樟村社已全面推广这种“牛力火车”，并注意修整道路，便于“火车”通行。
    值得重视的问题
    3日安徽日报发表的一封读者来信，提出了一个值得重视的问题。读者靖之反映，在寿县、霍山的某些农业社里，社员搞私人副业的收入超过了参加集体生产的收入，两者的比例是倒四六，甚至倒三七。这样，集体生产的发展和社的巩固都受到影响。在发表这封来信的同时，报纸上又登出一条消息，报道阜南县薛集镇城郊农业社在整社中通过大辩论，订出适当限制私人副业的办法，扭转了部分社员光搞私人运输不干农活的偏向，做到先公后私，皆大欢喜。安徽日报在短评中肯定了城郊社的做法，指出两条道路的斗争并未结束，对社员个人经营副业应当适当限制。
    “试验田”制度化
    江西日报2日刊登了江西省人民委员会关于省级机关干部推行“试验田”和轮流参加劳动锻炼的规定。按照这个规定，省级各单位科长以上负责干部，都必须无例外地根据本身工作性质，确定一定数量的土地或者一个工厂、一个车间、一个商店、一个学校………作为自己的“试验田”，直接参加劳动，参加基层工作，以吸取经验，指导全面。每人在“试验田”劳动和工作的时间，最低限度每年不得少于一个月。对省级机关干部轮流参加劳动锻炼，也作了具体规定。这些规定将使得搞“试验田”和参加劳动锻炼形成制度。
    工业技术大军开赴农村
    发展地方工业是当前重要任务之一，山西省抽调四百七十名技术工人和技术人员到各县县营工业和手工业生产合作社去支援农业技术革命。他们中间有工程师、技师和技术人员，也有劳动模范和先进生产者。2日中共山西省委和省人民委员会举行大会，热烈欢送这批到农村发展工业的先行者。三日山西日报发表这个消息，并发表了社论，称之为具有重大意义的革命行动。
    幸福社的幸福之路
    四川省沐川县三新乡山岭纵横、土多田少，玉米每亩产量只有一百多斤。这个乡的幸福农业社从1956年就研究出一种“团大窝”的种植法，在二十二亩地里进行试验，结果亩产提高到三百五十至四百五十斤；1957年又在十八亩地里试验，并增施肥料和改进栽培技术，结果平均亩产达到六百斤，最高的到七百五十斤。同年这个乡的其他一些社也用同一方法作试验获得了高产。3月31日四川日报一版头条报道了幸福社的这个创造，并详尽介绍了“团大窝”的具体作法，这是农业战线上值得注意的一个创举。
