Visiting Dulles (A Short Crosstalk)
Lao She Text Hua Junwu Painting

        Visitor—A
        Dulles—B
A: Secretary of State, may I ask why the Soviet Union
    repeatedly disarms?
B: Because the more the Soviet army disarms, the more
    terrifying it becomes!
A: Secretary of State, is the United States also preparing to disarm?
B: No, we are expanding our army!
A: May I ask, why is that?
B: The more the American army expands, the smaller it becomes, and the more peaceful!
A: Forgive me, I don't quite understand: Why
    does the Soviet army become more numerous with disarmament, and the American army
    become smaller with expansion?
B: Sometimes numbers increase when added to, and increase when subtracted from!
A: I still don't understand! May I ask: The Soviet Union launched two artificial satellites, what are
    your thoughts, Secretary of State?
B: I have no thoughts!
A: Is it that the more thoughts the Secretary of State has, the fewer thoughts he has?
    The more thoughts he has, the fewer thoughts he has?
B: You're guessing pretty close, you're quite smart!
A: Did you see the two artificial satellites?
B: I didn't see them.
A and B: The more I don't see them, the more I see them, the more I see them, the less I see them!
A: May I ask what kind of logic the Secretary of State uses?
B: Hard to say! Hard to say!
A: Could it be said to be this kind of logic: The more confused, the more logical; the more clear, the less logical.
B: What you're saying has some meaning!
A: Thank you, Secretary of State! May I ask: Why did the Soviet Union stop nuclear weapons testing?
B: The more tests are stopped, the more nuclear weapons there are!
A: Is the United States also preparing to stop testing?
B: No! The more tests are not stopped, the fewer nuclear weapons there are!
A: Secretary of State, isn't it that the more tests are not stopped, the more peaceful the world will be?
B: Of course! You've learned my logic!
A: The people of the world all demand a stop to testing, what should be done?
B: The more the people demand a stop to testing, the more we will conduct tests!
A: Then what if the Soviet Union's decision wins more popular support, and the United States wins less, what should be done?
B: The more popular support they get, the worse it is!
A: How is it bad?
B: The more you ask, the less I'll say!
A: What if the people of the world and the American people all insist on asking you?
B: I still won't say!
A: If you don't say, what if they overthrow you?
B: The more they want to overthrow me, the less I'll fall!
A: How can you not fall?
B: The more you ask, the less I'll say! The more you dig to the bottom, the less I'll say! Goodbye! Goodbye!
A: Goodbye! Secretary of State, the more you say goodbye, the sooner you'll disappear from sight!
B: How will I disappear from sight?
A: The more you ask, the less I'll say!
