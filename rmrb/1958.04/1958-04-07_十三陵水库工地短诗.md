Short poems were posted on the bulletin board at the Ming Tombs Reservoir construction site. Transcribed below:

	Hot blood conquers the depth of winter
	Hands transform nature
	Building a reservoir to control floods
	From now on, arid land becomes rice paddies

	Splitting mountains and building dams, wading through ice
	Transporting stones and carrying earth, quick as the wind
	In daytime, red flags flutter everywhere
	At night, ten thousand points of starlight

	The moon is our sun
	Sand and earth are our paper
	When the reservoir is completed
	Illiteracy will also be wiped out

	Dust swirls, the sky darkens
	Boulders rumble, the river churns
	Cannon fire shakes the cliffs
	Red flags wave, laughter rings out

	Hands split open Heavenly Longevity Mountain
	Three hundred thousand mu will no longer depend on heaven

### 十三陵水库工地短诗

    十三陵水库工地短诗
    十三陵水库工地的贴报牌上有一些短诗，抄录如下：
    热血战胜三九天
    双手改造大自然
    修成水库制洪水
    从今旱地变水田
    劈山筑坝下水冰
    运石担土快如风
    白天红旗飘百面
    夜里灯光万点星
    月亮当太阳
    沙土当纸张
    水库修建成
    文盲也扫光
    烟土飞扬天昏暗
    滚石奔腾河水翻
    炮声威震悬崖倒
    红旗招展笑声欢
    双手劈开天寿山
    三十万亩不靠天
