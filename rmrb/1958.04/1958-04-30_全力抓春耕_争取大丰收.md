Go All Out for Spring Farming and Strive for a Bumper Harvest
Huang Yan, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Anhui Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party

The preparatory work for Anhui's great production began as early as last autumn. Because attention was paid early and various tasks, especially political and ideological work, were carried out relatively thoroughly, this year's spring farming production campaign has generally been successful. The masses generally reflect that this year's spring farming preparation is sufficient, the start is early, the momentum is great, and the results exceed any previous year.

First, let's talk about water conservancy. The province has now completed 4.5 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work, more than twice the total of 1.47 billion cubic meters of earth and stone work completed in the previous eight years. According to preliminary calculations, the benefits of these projects can increase the irrigation area by 13.74 million mu, improve the irrigation area by 16.13 million mu, eliminate waterlogging from 17.89 million mu, and maintain soil and water over an area of 3,219 square kilometers.

Secondly, let's talk about manure accumulation. Various types of farm manure have now been accumulated to 70 billion dan. Calculated according to the province's cultivated land, the average amount of fertilizer applied per mu is more than 760 dan, and there are 29 counties where the average amount of fertilizer accumulated per mu is more than 1,000 dan, and some counties have reached more than 2,000 dan.

The achievements made in water conservancy and manure accumulation are extremely beneficial to this year's spring farming and great production, especially for summer harvest crops, and have already played a huge role. At present, summer harvest crops are growing vigorously, and a bumper harvest is expected. If there are no major natural disasters this year, and we redouble our efforts subjectively, it is entirely possible to exceed the original plan.

Several Main Problems Discovered During Inspection

In order to give full play to the role of preparatory work and timely solve the problems in spring farming and spring sowing, and to ensure the timely completion of spring farming and spring sowing, the Provincial Party Committee organized two major inspections this spring. Through inspection, the following problems were discovered and resolved:

	(1) Criticism of complacency. The main manifestations of complacency: One is that this year's wheat is growing better than in previous years, and a bumper harvest is a foregone conclusion, so there is no need to continue to strengthen management; the other is that they are satisfied with the existing achievements in water conservancy, manure accumulation, and other work, are complacent, and do not seek to continue to move forward. We have carried out certain education and criticism on these erroneous understandings, so that they realize that although the growth of summer harvest crops is better than in previous years, it cannot be finalized now. The masses say well, "Grain is on the threshing floor, wheat is in the warehouse, and soybeans are carried on the shoulders before a bumper harvest can be expected." This shows that before the crops are harvested, changes are still great. Therefore, we should continue to strengthen the management of summer harvest crops. As for the great achievements in water conservancy and manure accumulation, we should not have the slightest pride and complacency, because this is still far from the needs of increased production.

	(2) Correction of the phenomenon of average use of forces. In the most recent inspection, we found that some comrades equated spring farming, spring planting, afforestation, elimination of the four pests, literacy campaigns, and other tasks, and everything was progressing at the same pace. As a result, forces were dispersed, the center was affected, and the masses were fatigued. This is one situation. Another situation is that in spring farming production, attention is not paid to the rational arrangement of labor, resulting in waste of manpower. There is also a tendency to simply pursue labor intensity and not pay attention to rhythm, resulting in excessive tension. Although these phenomena have attracted our attention and have been corrected, we must strengthen leadership so that these phenomena will not occur as much as possible.

	(3) Strengthened the leadership in weak areas to overcome the lack of momentum in some areas. In the inspection, in addition to timely summarizing and promoting the experience of advanced areas to drive the general areas, leadership was also strengthened in those areas where the work was not solid, the leap forward momentum was insufficient, and the increase production plans lacked specific measures through inspection. The first is to strengthen political and ideological leadership, through airing views, contending, and debates, to combat evil spirits, establish righteousness, and raise the socialist consciousness and revolutionary drive of cadres and the masses.

The Task is Extremely Arduous and Requires Redoubled Efforts

Because the above problems have been solved, the understanding of the broad masses of cadres and the masses has been further improved, and an upsurge of learning from the advanced and catching up with the advanced has been set off, which has powerfully promoted spring farming and spring sowing work and accelerated the progress of spring farming and spring sowing. According to the seasons of our province and past farming habits, the sowing of early and mid-season rice has been advanced by half a month compared with previous years. The quality of spring farming and spring sowing is also better than in previous years. In order to strive for a bumper harvest throughout the year, we must continue to strengthen the following work.

	First, further strengthen political and ideological work. This is the main guarantee for making the production upsurge vigorous and lasting. With the in-depth development of the production upsurge, some new problems will continue to arise in people's minds. We must constantly strengthen ideological leadership, especially in the busy and tense spring farming campaign.

	Second, improve the production management of agricultural cooperatives. At present, the main task is to further do a good job in the "three guarantees" of contracting work, contracting production, and contracting costs, and to conscientiously implement the "five determinations" method of contracting field odd jobs to households, and determining plans, determining output, determining work, determining quality, and determining time. These are all effective measures to improve the production management of agricultural cooperatives. It can greatly encourage the enthusiasm of the members, strengthen the sense of responsibility of the members, and make the increase production targets based on a more reliable foundation.

	Third, give full play to the role of water conservancy projects. At present, we should seize the time to complete unfinished projects, complete one, implement one, and store water in one; and do a good job in lifting water tools, so that the water conservancy projects built in our province can play its role.

	Fourth, seize the time to transport fertilizer to the fields. It is a considerable task to transport all the accumulated fertilizer to the fields. In order to save labor and achieve reasonable fertilization, high-efficiency fine fertilizer can be applied to distant and infertile land, and low-efficiency coarse fertilizer can be applied to nearby and good land. In addition, we must make extensive use of various advanced transportation tools created in the construction of water conservancy to improve transportation efficiency.

	Fifth, complete the sowing plan for high-yield crops. Rice, sweet potatoes, and corn are the main crops with a large proportion and high yield among Anhui's food crops. This year, our province plans to plant more than 47 million mu of rice, 17 million mu of sweet potatoes, and 6 million mu of corn. The output of these three crops alone accounts for more than 80% of the total annual grain production plan. Therefore, we must seize the time to take various measures to complete the sowing plan in a timely manner.

	Sixth, properly arrange labor. The task of spring farming and great production is large, the season is tight, and the farm work is detailed. If we do not distinguish between priorities and reasonably arrange labor, it may cause us to lose sight of the other, resulting in waste of manpower. Therefore, we must make reasonable arrangements according to the order, priority, and technical level of farm work. Achieve that everyone does their best and each gets what they deserve. At the same time, we must pay attention to adjusting working hours, and vigorously create and use various advanced production tools to reduce labor intensity and improve labor efficiency.

At present, Anhui's spring farming and great production campaign is developing vigorously, and certain achievements have already been made, but this is only the first step in achieving success. The tasks facing us are still very arduous, and we may encounter some new difficulties in our work, especially for Anhui, which is prone to disasters, we must have sufficient estimates. Therefore, we must take greater determination and courage to do a good job in spring farming and great production, fully estimate the possible situations, and take effective measures in a timely manner to strengthen the guarantee for striving for a bumper harvest this year.

    全力抓春耕　争取大丰收
    中共安徽省委书记处书记　黄岩
    安徽大生产的准备工作，早在去年秋季就开始注意了。由于注意得早，各项工作特别是政治思想工作做得比较充分，因而今年的春耕生产运动一般是开展得好的。群众普遍反映：今年的春耕准备足、动手早、劲头大，成绩超过了以往任何一年。
    先说水利。全省现已完成土石方四十五亿公方，超过以往八年兴修水利土石方总和十四亿七千万公方的两倍以上。据初步计算，这些工程的效益，共可增加灌溉面积一千三百七十四万亩，改善灌溉面积一千六百十三万亩，除涝一千七百八十九万亩，水土保持面积三千二百十九平方公里。
    再说积肥。现在已积各种农家肥料达七百亿担，按全省耕地计算，平均每亩可施肥七百六十多担，并有二十九个县积肥量平均每亩达千担以上，有些县已达到两千担以上。
    水利、积肥方面取得的成绩，对今年春耕大生产极为有利，尤其是对夏收作物，已经起了巨大的作用。当前夏收作物生长旺盛，丰收有望。如果今年不发生特大的自然灾害，我们主观上再加倍努力，超额完成原订计划是完全有可能的。
    检查发现的几个主要问题
    为了充分发挥备耕工作的作用，及时解决春耕春种中的问题，保证适时做好春耕春种工作，今春省委组织了两次大检查。通过检查，发现和解决了以下几个问题：
      （一）批判了自满情绪。自满情绪的主要表现：一种是认为今年的麦子长得比往年好，丰收已成定局，不需要继续加强管理；另一种是满足于水利、积肥等项工作的既得成绩，沾沾自喜，不求继续前进。对于这些错误认识，我们都进行了一定的教育和批判，使他们认识到夏收作物的生长情况虽比往年好，但现在还不能定局。群众说得好，“谷上场，麦上仓，黄豆扛到肩膀上，丰收才算有希望”，这说明了在庄稼未收到手之前，变化还是很大的。因此，目前对夏收作物还应该继续加强管理，至于在水利、积肥方面虽然取得了很大成绩，但绝不应该有丝毫的骄傲自满，因为这和增产需要比较起来还相差很远。
      （二）纠正了平均使用力量的现象。在最近一次检查中，我们发现一些同志把春耕春种、造林、除四害、扫盲等项工作平列起来，一切事情都齐头并进，结果就分散了力量，影响了中心，也疲劳了群众。这是一种情况。另一种情况，是在春耕生产中不注意劳力合理安排，形成窝工浪费现象。也还有单纯追求劳动强度，不注意节奏，造成过分紧张的偏向。这些现象虽然已经引起我们注意，并作了纠正，但是还必须加强领导，使这些现象尽可能地不再发生。
      （三）加强了薄弱地区的领导，克服某些地区劲头不足的现象。在检查中，除了及时总结和推广了先进地区的经验，带动一般地区以外，对于那些工作不踏实，跃进劲头不足，增产计划缺乏具体措施的地区，也都通过检查，加强了领导。首先是加强了政治思想领导，通过鸣放和辩论，打击邪气、树立正气，提高干部和群众的社会主义觉悟和革命干劲。
    任务十分艰巨需要加倍努力
    由于解决了以上问题，就进一步提高了广大干部和群众的认识，掀起了一个学先进、赶先进的热潮，有力的推动了春耕春种工作，加快了春耕春种的进度。按我省季节和过去的耕作习惯，早、中稻播种工作都比往年提早了半个月。春耕春种的质量，也比往年好。为了争取全年丰收，当前还须再接再厉地加强以下工作。
    第一，进一步加强政治思想工作。这是使生产高潮旺盛持久的主要保证。随着生产高潮的深入发展，人们思想上还会不断地产生一些新的问题，必须不断地加强思想领导，特别是在繁忙紧张的春耕运动中更要加强思想领导。
    第二，改进农业合作社的生产管理。当前主要是进一步做好包工、包产、包费用的三包工作和认真贯彻田间零活包到户以及定计划、定产量、定工、定质、定时的五定办法。这都是改善农业社生产管理的有效措施，它可以大大鼓励社员的积极性，加强社员的责任心，使增产指标建立在更加可靠的基础上。
    第三，充分发挥水利工程的作用。当前应抓紧完成未了工程，做到完工一处，落实一处，蓄水一处；并做好提水工具，使我省兴修的水利工程都能发挥它的作用。
    第四，抓紧运肥下田。把已积的肥料全部运下田，是一个相当繁重的工作。为了节省劳动力，做到合理施肥，可将肥效高的细肥上远地、瘦地，肥效低的粗肥上近地、好地，并且要大量利用兴修水利中创造的各种先进运输工具，以提高运输效率。
    第五，完成高产作物的播种计划。水稻、山芋、玉米，是安徽粮食作物中比重大、产量高的几项主要作物。今年我省计划水稻的种植面积四千七百多万亩，山芋种植面积一千七百万亩，玉米种植面积六百万亩。仅这三项作物的产量，即占全年粮食计划总产量的80％以上。因此，我们必须抓紧时间采取各种办法，适时完成播种计划。
    第六，妥善安排劳力。春耕大生产的任务大、季节紧、农活细，如不分别轻重缓急，合理安排劳动力，就可能造成顾此失彼、窝工浪费现象。因此必须按照农活的先后、轻重，技术的高低，进行合理安排。做到人尽其才，各得其所。同时，要注意调节劳动时间，并要大力创造和使用各种先进生产工具，以减轻劳动强度，提高劳动效率。
    目前安徽春耕大生产运动正在蓬蓬勃勃地开展，而且已经取得了一定的成绩，但这仅仅是取得成绩的第一步。摆在我们面前的任务还十分艰巨，在工作中还可能会遇到一些新的困难，特别对多灾的安徽来说，更要有足够估计。因此，必须拿出更大的决心和勇气，全力做好春耕大生产工作，充分估计可能发生的情况，及时采取有效措施，以加强争取今年大丰收的保证。
