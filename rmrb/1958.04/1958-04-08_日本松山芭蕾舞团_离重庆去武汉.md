Xinhua News Agency, Chongqing, 7th -- After performing six ballet performances for more than 22,000 spectators in Chongqing, the Japanese Matsuyama Ballet Troupe left Chongqing by boat this morning for Wuhan.

　　Matsuyama Mikiko, the deputy head of the ballet troupe who plays Xi'er in "The White Haired Girl," was so excited when she learned that the audience was scrambling to buy extra seats for their last performance that she said she really wanted to stay in China for a few more years and perform "The White Haired Girl" a few more times so that all the audiences who wanted to see "The White Haired Girl" could see it before returning home. Shimizu Masao, the head of the ballet troupe, said that he would never forget the Chongqing people's friendship towards them and their love for ballet art.

　　During their performances in Chongqing, the Japanese artists also visited factories, agricultural cooperatives, schools, museums, and the Chongqing Song and Dance Troupe, and conducted extensive friendly get-togethers with workers, farmers, and actors.
