Xinhua News Agency, 9th April: The Ministry of Foreign Affairs today sent a note to the British Office of the Chargé d'Affaires in China, lodging a serious protest against the British government's action on the morning of April 8th in disregarding the legitimate demands and protests of the Chinese government by allowing a Chiang gang four-engine P4y naval patrol bomber and its crew, which had intruded into mainland China and landed in Hong Kong, to return to Taiwan. It solemnly stated that this unfriendly and hostile act by the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong towards the Chinese government and the Chinese people will inevitably have an adverse impact on Sino-British relations.

This Chiang gang military aircraft landed at Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon at approximately 7 a.m. Hong Kong time on April 7th after intruding into our mainland. Before dawn on April 7th, this aircraft conducted reconnaissance and harassment activities over areas such as Xuwen in the Leizhou Peninsula of Guangdong Province, China. That evening, Huang Hua, Director of the West European Department of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, met with Mr. Wen Yuesheng, the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, to protest the fact that the British authorities in Hong Kong had allowed this Chiang gang military aircraft, which had been engaged in hostile activities against the mainland, to land in Hong Kong, and demanded that the British government immediately detain the Chiang gang military aircraft and all personnel on board.

The full text of the note that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs delivered to the British Chargé d'Affaires on April 9th is as follows:

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People’s Republic of China presents its compliments to the British Office of the Chargé d'Affaires, and regarding the British government's permission on April 8, 1958, for the Chiang Kai-shek clique's P4y military aircraft and all personnel on board that had landed in Hong Kong to fly back to Taiwan, lodges the following serious protest and statement, which is requested to be conveyed immediately to the British government.

On April 7, 1958, a P4y military aircraft of the Chiang Kai-shek clique landed at Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon after conducting reconnaissance and harassment activities over Xuwen area of Leizhou Peninsula, Guangdong Province, China. On the evening of the incident, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs notified the British Chargé d'Affaires in Beijing, and protested the British authorities in Hong Kong's permission for the aforementioned Chiang Kai-shek clique's military aircraft to land in Hong Kong. At the same time, it requested the British government to immediately detain the aircraft and all personnel on board.

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has now learned that the British government allowed the Chiang Kai-shek clique's military aircraft and all personnel on board to take off from Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon and return to Taiwan on the morning of April 8th. This action by the British government cannot but arouse great indignation in the Chinese government and the Chinese people.

In its conversation with the British Chargé d'Affaires on April 7, 1958, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs specifically mentioned the incident on January 31, 1956, in which a Chiang Kai-shek clique fighter plane, after harassing the Chinese mainland, landed at Kai Tak Airport in Kowloon to evade pursuit by Chinese Air Force planes. It was pointed out that in that incident, although the British government stated that it had no intention of allowing Hong Kong to be used as a base for hostile activities against anyone, it in fact disregarded international practice and the legitimate demands of the Chinese government to detain the aircraft and its crew, and allowed the crew to return to Taiwan, and subsequently allowed the aircraft to be transported to Taiwan. For this, the Chinese government had lodged serious protests with the British government on two occasions.

Despite this, in the incident on April 7th, the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong once again disregarded international practice and the legitimate demands of the Chinese government, not only allowing the Chiang Kai-shek clique's military aircraft to land in Hong Kong after carrying out reconnaissance and harassing military activities over the Xuwen area of the Leizhou Peninsula in Guangdong Province, China, but also allowing the aircraft and all personnel on board to fly back to Taiwan from Hong Kong. This fully demonstrates that the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong are clearly intentionally condoning and encouraging the Chiang Kai-shek clique to use Hong Kong as a base and sanctuary for carrying out military sabotage activities against China, thereby seriously threatening China's security. This is completely contrary to the British government's statement that it has no intention of allowing Hong Kong to be used as a base for hostile activities against anyone.

Therefore, the Chinese government lodges a serious protest against the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong's permission for the Chiang Kai-shek clique's P4y military aircraft to land in Hong Kong and their permission for the aircraft and all personnel on board to take off from Hong Kong and return to Taiwan, and solemnly declares that this unfriendly and hostile act by the British government and the British authorities in Hong Kong towards the Chinese government and the Chinese people will inevitably have an adverse impact on Sino-British relations; the British government shall be responsible for all the consequences arising therefrom.

To the British Office of the Chargé d'Affaires
		April 9, 1958, in Beijing

### 英国纵放窜扰大陆后降落香港的蒋帮飞机  我外交部向英政府严重抗议

    英国纵放窜扰大陆后降落香港的蒋帮飞机
    我外交部向英政府严重抗议
    新华社9日讯　外交部今天照会英国驻华代办处，对英国政府在4月8日早晨，不顾中国政府的正当要求和抗议纵放在大陆窜扰后在香港降落的一架蒋帮四引擎P4y型海军巡逻轰炸机和机上人员返回台湾一事提出严重抗议，并且郑重声明：英国政府和香港英国当局这种对中国政府和中国人民极不友好和怀有敌意的行为，必将使中英关系蒙受不利的影响。
    这架蒋帮军事飞机是在4月7日香港时间上午七时许在窜扰我国大陆后在九龙启德机场降落的，这架飞机4月7日拂晓前曾在我国广东雷州半岛徐闻等地区上空进行侦察和骚扰活动。当天晚上，外交部西欧司司长黄华曾就这一事件接见了英国驻华代办文郁生，对香港英国当局竟然允许这架在大陆进行敌对活动的蒋帮军机在香港降落一事提出抗议，并且要求英国政府立即将这架蒋帮军机连同机上全部人员予以扣留。
    外交部4月9日递交英国代办处的照会全文如下：
    中华人民共和国外交部谨向英国代办处致意，并且就1958年4月8日英国政府准许降落香港的蒋介石集团P4y型军事飞机和机上全部人员飞返台湾一事，提出严重抗议和声明如下，请即转达英国政府。
    1958年4月7日蒋介石集团P4y型军事飞机一架在对中国广东省雷州半岛徐闻地区上空进行侦察和骚扰活动以后降落在九龙启德机场。外交部在事件发生的当晚即通知了英国驻北京代办，并且对于香港英国当局允许上述蒋介石集团军事飞机在香港降落一事提出抗议，同时要求英国政府立即将这架飞机和机上全部人员予以扣留。
    外交部现悉英国政府已于4月8日早晨准许该蒋介石集团军事飞机和机上全部人员从九龙启德机场起飞返回台湾。英国政府这种行为不能不引起中国政府和中国人民极大的愤慨。
    外交部在1958年4月7日同英国代办先生的谈话中，曾特别提到1956年1月31日发生的蒋介石集团战斗机一架骚扰中国大陆以后为逃避中国空军飞机的追击而在九龙启德机场降落的事件，并且指出在这一事件上，英国政府虽然声明它无意容许香港被利用为对任何人进行敌对活动的基地，但事实上它却不顾国际惯例和中国政府提出的扣留该飞机和机上人员的正当要求，竟然准许机上人员返回台湾，随后又准许将该飞机运往台湾。为此，中国政府曾经两次向英国政府提出严重抗议。
    尽管如此，在4月7日发生的事件上，英国政府和香港英国当局竟然又一次不顾国际惯例和中国政府的正当要求，不但允许蒋介石集团军事飞机于对中国广东省雷州半岛徐闻地区进行侦察和骚扰的军事活动后在香港降落，而且又准许该飞机和机上全部人员从香港飞回台湾。这充分说明了英国政府和香港英国当局显然是有意地纵容和鼓励蒋介石集团利用香港来作为对中国进行军事破坏活动的基地和庇护所，从而严重地威胁了中国的安全。这同英国政府关于它无意容许香港被利用为对任何人进行敌对活动的基地的声明是完全背道而驰的。
    为此，中国政府对于英国政府和香港英国当局准许蒋介石集团P4y型军事飞机在香港降落和准许该飞机和机上全部人员从香港起飞返回台湾一事提出严重的抗议，并且郑重地声明：英国政府和香港英国当局这种对中国政府和中国人民极不友好和怀有敌意的行为，必将使中英关系蒙受不利的影响；由此而引起的一切后果概应由英国政府负责。
    此致英国代办处
              1958年4月9日于北京
