    Shelling Tea and Tung Seeds for Oil Extraction: New Method for Increasing Oil Production in Hunan
    (Our report) Hunan Province Grain Bureau is promoting a new method of increasing oil production throughout the province. According to this method, the 1958-1959 production year will see an increase of more than 40 million jin of oil.
    After repeated tests, they have proven that shelling tea and tung oil seeds before oil extraction results in a higher oil yield than extracting oil with the shells on, while also saving manpower. When using traditional presses with the shells on, one hundred jin of tea seeds yields an average of twenty-five jin of oil, and one hundred jin of tung seeds yields twenty-eight jin. After shelling, using traditional presses, one hundred jin of tea seeds can yield an average of thirty to thirty-two jin of oil, and one hundred jin of tung seeds yields thirty-three to thirty-five jin. Shelling, if using an oil press, will produce more than one jin more oil per hundred jin than traditional presses. The labor productivity of machine pressing is more than 30% higher than that of traditional pressing. After this reform, it is estimated that the province will increase tea oil production by 25 million jin and tung oil production by 7.5 million jin this year.

    茶籽桐籽去壳榨油  湖南增产油脂新办法
    本报讯　湖南省粮食厅正在全省推广一种新的增产油脂的方法。按照这种方法1958—1959年生产年度就将增产油脂四千多万斤。
    经过他们多次试验证明，先去掉茶油桐油籽壳榨油，比带壳榨油出油率高，同时还节省人力。带壳用土榨每一百斤茶籽平均出油二十五斤，一百斤桐籽出二十八斤；去壳后用土榨每一百斤茶籽平均可出油三十至三十二斤，一百斤桐籽出三十三至三十五斤。去壳后如用榨油机榨又要比土榨每一百斤多出一斤多油。机榨比土榨的劳动生产率高30％以上。经过这番改革以后，预计全省今年将增产茶油二千五百万斤，桐油七百五十万斤。
