To Open New Avenues for Commerce to Serve Agriculture:

    Supply and Marketing Cooperatives and Agricultural Cooperatives Jointly Run Small Factories
    The Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China Promotes the Experience of Nan'an District
    (Our dispatch from Chongqing, April 20th) The supply and marketing cooperatives and agricultural cooperatives of Nan'an District, Chongqing City, after eight days of hard work, jointly established twelve small factories. This practice of the Nan'an District Supply and Marketing Cooperative has opened up new avenues for commercial work to better serve agricultural production. On April 17, the Chongqing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China organized more than 1,000 party branch secretaries, managers, and employees from various units of the financial and trade systems to visit the rural areas of Nan'an District and held an on-site meeting. These factories include agricultural tool repair and assembly plants, granular fertilizer plants, feed processing plants, bamboo and wood products processing plants, etc., all of which serve to increase agricultural production. During the construction, the employees of the supply and marketing cooperatives used their evenings to repair the factory buildings and modify the machines. Agricultural cooperatives in Huangjueya and Xinxing townships dispatched bricklayers, stonemasons, and carpenters to work day and night. Technicians from nearby machinery factories, textile factories, and fertilizer factories also came to help modify and install machines. Technicians from the Chongqing Fertilizer Factory taught the farmers the technology for producing granular fertilizer and provided specific guidance for production. Starting from April 5th, all twelve small factories were completed and put into production within eight days.
    Before the construction of these factories, the Nan'an District Supply and Marketing Cooperative sent working groups to the townships and cooperatives to solicit opinions from rural party organizations and agricultural cooperatives and investigate local resource conditions. Therefore, these factories generally used local materials and their products met local needs. For example, the Wangshan area in the district produces bamboo, and there are farmers who can weave bamboo products locally, so the district supply and marketing cooperative established a bamboo products processing plant nearby. Huangjueya is located in a mountainous area with a shortage of fertilizer, and Xinxing Township has a relatively concentrated population with plenty of garbage, so the supply and marketing cooperative established a granular fertilizer plant in each of these two townships.
    The construction of these small factories paid attention to utilizing the existing foundation of rural handicrafts. The total investment was more than 7,300 yuan, all of which was drawn from the welfare fund of the supply and marketing cooperative, without asking for a single penny from the state. The factory equipment was simple and crude, mostly old tools or modified from discarded machines. The factory buildings were all empty houses that were idle in the countryside. The total annual output value of these factories can reach more than 520,000 yuan.
    There has long been a contradiction between the supply of means of production by the Nan'an District Supply and Marketing Cooperative and the needs of farmers. Farmers have made many criticisms of the supply and marketing cooperative for its untimely, unsuitable, and insufficient supply of means of production. After these factories were established, the supply and marketing of means of production has greatly improved, and farmers have praised them unanimously. For example, in the past, farmers had to wait for more than a month to get their hoes repaired. Now, with six agricultural tool repair and assembly plants, the needs of farmers in the district for processing and repairing agricultural tools can be basically met. The bamboo and wooden agricultural tools and implements needed by farmers in Nan'an District have always relied on supplies from other places, which could not meet the needs. Now, bamboo and wooden agricultural tools and implements can be partially self-sufficient, and can gradually become self-sufficient in the future. The Huangjueya Township Fertilizer Plant and the Xinxing Township Fertilizer Plant now produce six tons of granular fertilizer daily, all of which is supplied to the farmers of the two townships. In the past, farmers in these two townships worked in the fields during the day and had to take care of pig feed when they returned home in the evening, which was too much to handle. Now, the feed processing plants in these two townships can process feed for the farmers, which is estimated to save the farmers 10,000 labor days per year.
    Based on this pilot experience, the Nan'an District Committee of the Communist Party of China has further made district-wide plans. More than ten processing plants will also be established throughout the district this year, and the existing agricultural tool repair and assembly, woodworking, fertilizer, and feed factories will be gradually converted into semi-mechanical operations, and the iron agricultural tool repair and assembly plants will be expanded into township-wide machine repair stations. The Nan'an District Committee also decided that, after training and learning in batches, the current commercial staff in the district will be both proficient in commerce and in industrial and agricultural production; both knowledgeable in technology and in politics; to achieve
  "Learn what you do, and understand what you learn." For example, cotton cloth salespersons understand tailoring, and pig procurement personnel know how to treat pig diseases, becoming all-round commercial personnel who are both red and expert. At the same time, using factories as a base, farmers are trained to learn how to use chemical fertilizers and understand production technology, so that they are proficient in both agriculture and industry.

### 开辟商业为农业服务的新途径  供销社农业社合办小工厂  中共重庆市委推广南岸区的经验

    开辟商业为农业服务的新途径
    供销社农业社合办小工厂
    中共重庆市委推广南岸区的经验
    本报重庆20日电　重庆市南岸区供销合作社和农业社苦战八天，合办起十二个小型工厂。南岸区供销社这种做法，为商业工作更好地为农业生产服务开辟了新的途径。中共重庆市委在4月17日组织财贸系统各单位党支部书记、经理和职工一千多人到南岸区农村参观，并召开了现场会议。这批工厂包括农具修配厂、颗粒肥料厂、饲料加工厂、竹器和木器加工厂等，都是为农业增产服务的。在兴建中，供销社的职工利用晚上时间，人人动手整修厂房，改装机器。黄桷垭和新兴等乡的农业社，抽调泥工、石工、木工星夜赶工。附近的几个机器厂和纺织厂、肥料厂的技术工人，也来帮助改制机器、安装机器。重庆肥料厂的技术工人教给农民生产颗粒肥料的技术，并具体指导生产。从4月5日开始，八天内这十二个小型工厂全部建成投入生产。
    这批工厂兴办以前，南岸区供销社派出工作组下乡下社广泛征求农村党组织和农业社的意见，调查了当地资源情况，因此这批工厂一般都是就地取材，产品适合当地需要。例如区内汪山一带产竹子，当地又有能编制竹器的农民，区供销社就在附近兴办了竹器加工厂。黄桷垭位在高山地区，肥料缺乏，新兴乡居民较集中，垃圾多，供销社就在这两个乡各办了一个颗粒肥料厂。
    这批小型工厂的兴建，注意利用农村原有手工业的基础，全部投资共七千三百多元，都是由供销社从公益金中抽出来的，没有要国家一分钱。工厂的设备都是因陋就简，大部分是旧有的工具或利用废旧的机器改制的。厂房都是农村中闲置不用的空房子。这批工厂全年的总产值可以达到五十二万多元。
    南岸区供销合作社的生产资料供应工作，与农民需要之间长期以来存在矛盾，农民对供销社供应生产资料不及时、不合用、数量少等提出过不少批评。这批工厂办起来后，生产资料供销工作大为改观，农民同声赞许。比如过去农民修理一把锄头，需要等候一个多月才能取货。现在有六个农具修配厂修理，基本可以满足区内农民加工和修理农具的需要。南岸区农民需用的竹木农具和工具，一向依靠外地供应，满足不了需要。现在竹木质农具和用具可以部分自给，将来还可以逐步做到自给自足。黄桷垭乡肥料厂和新兴乡肥料厂现在每日生产六吨颗粒肥料，全部供给两乡的农民。以往这两乡农民白天做田间活，晚上回家还要料理猪饲料，忙不过来。现在这两乡的饲料加工厂可以代农民加工饲料，估计每年可以为农民节约一万个劳动日。
    中共南岸区委根据这个试点经验，又进一步作了全区规划。全区年内还将兴办十多个加工厂，并把已兴办的农具修配、木器、肥料、饲料等工厂逐步改成半机械操作，把铁制农具修配厂扩充为全乡的机器修配站。南岸区委并决定，经过分批训练、学习，使目前区内的商业工作人员既通商业，又通工农业生产；既懂技术，又通政治；做到
  “干什么，学什么，懂什么”。例如棉布售货员懂得剪裁，生猪采购员会医猪病，成为又红又专的全能商业工作人员。同时以工厂为基点，训练农民学会使用化学肥料，懂得生产技术，既会农业又会工业。
