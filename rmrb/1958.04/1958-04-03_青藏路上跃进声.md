The Qinghai-Tibet Highway is on average over 4,000 meters above sea level, and the natural environment is relatively harsh, but this automobile team, which has been battling snow-capped mountains and ice sheets for many years, believes that although there are many difficulties, they are not insurmountable. They said that the target of "300,000 Kilometers Without Major Overhaul" is based on practical experience from the past few years and is entirely achievable.

    青藏路上跃进声
    新华社拉萨2日电  行驶在青藏公路上的一个“解放牌”汽车小组，最近向青藏公路管理局的全体汽车驾驶员提出了“三十万公里无大修”的大跃进竞赛倡议。这一倡议得到了全管理局职工的响应。
    这个“解放牌”汽车小组是青藏公路管理局汽车第四队的第二十小组。他们在青藏公路上已经获得了“安全行车小组”的称号。青藏公路沿线拔海平均在四千公尺以上，自然环境比较差，但这个多年来一直同雪山和冰原作战的汽车小组认为，困难虽多，不是不可克服的。他们说，“三十万公里无大修”的指标是从过去几年来的实际经验出发，是完全可以实现的。
    目前，这个小组已经制定了实现这个指标的详尽计划。
