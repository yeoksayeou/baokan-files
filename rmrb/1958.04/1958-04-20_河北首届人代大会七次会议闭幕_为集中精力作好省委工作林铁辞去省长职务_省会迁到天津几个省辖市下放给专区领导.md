Xinhua News Agency, Baoding, April 19th: The Seventh Session of the First Hebei Provincial People's Congress concluded yesterday. The meeting passed resolutions on changing the administrative divisions of Hebei Province and moving the provincial capital to Tianjin, and elected the governor, added vice governors, and elected the president of the Provincial Higher People's Court.

The meeting was held in Baoding from April 16th to 18th. At the beginning of the meeting, Lin Tie, the Governor of Hebei Province, delivered an opening speech. He said that this meeting was convened under a new situation in the province. Currently, the province's mass rectification movement is being carried out in depth and has been combined with the production and construction movement. The province has launched an unprecedentedly magnificent upsurge in socialist construction. The broad masses of the people are waging unyielding struggles for the country's socialist industrialization and agricultural modernization with the spirit of moving mountains and overturning seas. The rapid development of industrial and agricultural production is rapidly changing the face of cities and villages.

Lin Tie pointed out that the task of the people of the province should be to summon up revolutionary vigor, try every possible means, use all positive factors, overcome all difficulties, and realize the great leap forward plan for industry and agriculture. He said that the change of Tianjin Municipality to a provincial-level city has brought about a major change in the situation of local industry in Hebei Province. We will be more able to realize this leap forward plan. At the same time, the change of Tianjin Municipality to a provincial-level city will further strengthen cooperation between urban and rural areas, between regions, and the close connection between production and sales and raw material supply, and promote the great development of industrial and agricultural production in Hebei Province.

Lin Tie emphasized that the urgent task in agricultural production is to mobilize the people of the province to fight against the drought in every possible way. Our slogan is "Ensure sowing without spring rains, and ensure a bumper harvest without annual rains" to ensure that the grain output of summer crops reaches 8 billion jin, and to lay the foundation for achieving a grain output of 25 billion jin this year.

The meeting also approved Lin Tie's request to resign from the post of governor in order to concentrate on his work as the First Secretary of the Hebei Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, and the requests of the two vice governors, Zhang Chengxian and Li Ziguang, to resign from the post of vice governors due to work-related reasons. In view of the serious political errors committed by Sun Guangrui, the President of the Hebei Provincial Higher People's Court, during his tenure, the meeting removed him from his post as President of the Court. The meeting then elected the governor, added vice governors, and elected the president of the Provincial Higher People's Court. The 512 representatives attending the meeting conducted the election by secret ballot. As a result, Liu Zihou was elected governor with 512 votes, Yang Yingjie, Li Gengtao, and Yang Yizhou were elected vice governors, and Wu Qingcheng was elected president of the Provincial Higher People's Court.

The meeting also passed a resolution on changing the administrative divisions of Hebei Province, deciding to merge the Handan Special Administrative Region and the Xingtai Special Administrative Region into the Handan Special Administrative Region; and to place Handan City under the leadership of the Handan Special Administrative Office. The Tianjin Special Administrative Region and the Cangxian Special Administrative Region were merged into the Tianjin Special Administrative Region, and Shijiazhuang City was placed under the leadership of the Shijiazhuang Special Administrative Office, Baoding City was placed under the leadership of the Baoding Special Administrative Office, Zhangjiakou City was placed under the leadership of the Zhangjiakou Special Administrative Office, Tangshan City and Qinhuangdao City were placed under the leadership of the Tangshan Special Administrative Office, and the Tongxian Special Administrative Region was abolished; and passed a resolution on moving the capital of Hebei Province to Tianjin City.
