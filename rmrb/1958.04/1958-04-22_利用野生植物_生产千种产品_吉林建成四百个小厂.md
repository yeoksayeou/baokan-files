This newspaper's Changchun dispatch on the 21st: The Jilin Province Second Commercial Department system will establish 5,200 small factories and breeding farms this year to fully utilize wild plants and local specialty resources to develop local industry.

Currently, the supply and marketing cooperatives in counties and townships throughout the province have already established 400 small factories producing products such as paper, potassium chloride, saltpeter, roasted rubber, and caustic soda, and are continuing to prepare for small factories producing sugar, oil, wine, sausage casings, gypsum, potassium sulfate, and clam shell fertilizer. After the wild plant harvest in autumn, they can produce thousands of products.

These established small factories generally use local wild plants and local specialties as raw materials for production. The supply and marketing cooperatives in the four counties of Shulan, Dunhua, and others in the Changbai Mountains have opened roasted rubber factories, using locally produced pine bark, willow catkin seeds, and large fruit stalk roots as raw materials. This year, they can produce 1,000 tons of roasted rubber, which is enough to meet the needs of the province's leather manufacturing industry. (Song Shiyi)

    利用野生植物　生产千种产品
    吉林建成四百个小厂
    本报长春21日电  吉林省第二商业厅系统今年将建立五千二百个小工厂和饲养场，充分利用野生植物和土特产资源，发展地方工业。
    目前全省的县、乡供销社已经建立起四百个制造纸张、氯化钾、火硝、烤胶、火碱等产品的小工厂，并继续筹办制糖、制油、制酒、肠衣、石膏、硫酸钾、蚌皮肥料等小工厂，到秋季野生植物收获后，可出产上千种产品。
    已建立的这批小工厂普遍利用当地野生植物和土特产做原料进行生产。长白山区舒兰、敦化等四县的供销社开办了烤胶工厂，利用本地出的松树皮、柳毛籽、大果梗根做原料，今年能产一千吨烤胶，足够省内制革工业的需要。（宋世宜）
