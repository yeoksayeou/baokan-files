Xinhua News Agency, 7th dispatch from Johannesburg: The South African progressive magazine "New Age" recently published an article detailing the struggle of the African people of Kenya for equal political rights.

　　The article stated: For more than half a century, the Africans of Kenya have been waging a heroic and resolute struggle against the oppressive regime of the local white residents. By 1950, tens of thousands of Africans responded to the call of the "Kenya African Union" led by Kenyatta, and carried out a heroic struggle for equality. The African trade unions also had a large number of members and were well organized.

　　Britain was then seriously considering making Kenya one of its main bases in Africa, and therefore decided to crush the African liberation movement. The first target of British suppression was the trade unions, followed by the "Kenya African Union." Kenyatta was sentenced to seven years in prison for supporting the activities of the "Mau Mau" organization (Editor's note: Armed patriotic organization of the Kenyan indigenous people). This was followed by one of the most horrific suppression movements in the tragic history of the African continent. For five years, "Mau Mau" members have been hunted down. More than 10,000 Africans were killed, and 70,000 Africans were imprisoned in concentration camps.

　　By 1955, Britain believed it could appease those in Britain and elsewhere who were horrified by its brutal suppression in the colonies. Therefore, Britain found some "moderate" Africans and announced its readiness to implement a "new deal" with them.

　　A group of selected Africans were granted the right to vote, and they obtained eight seats in the Legislative Council. The young trade union leader Mboya was one of the "moderate" Africans on whom the British and European colonists in Kenya pinned their hopes. Mboya had criticized "Mau Mau," however, the desire of all Africans in Kenya to fight for extensive rights for themselves was so urgent that Mboya's speeches began to be tougher than before.

　　In the elections held at the beginning of last year, a group of candidates headed by Mboya surprised and hated the British, because they defeated their "moderate" opponents, who voters considered to be merely lackeys of the white colonists.

　　The newly elected African members of the Legislative Council immediately demanded an increase in the number of African representatives in the Legislative Council after attending.

　　At the same time, African conferences were held across the country, expressing full support for the demands of the Mboya parliamentary group.

　　So the British Colonial Secretary Lennox-Boyd went to Kenya and, in cooperation with the Europeans there, drew up a new plan to increase the number of African representatives in the Legislative Council. However, he did not consult with the Africans when drawing up the new plan.

　　The African demand was to have a majority in the Legislative Council. However, the new plan only stipulated that Africans would have the same number of representatives as Europeans, and only a minority in the very important Cabinet. In addition, the plan stipulated the establishment of a "Special National Committee," mainly controlled by white colonists, who have enormous power to shelve and amend almost all laws. Africans refused to accept this new plan. The position of the African parliamentarians was fully supported at many conferences held in Nairobi, the capital of Kenya, and elsewhere.

　　The constantly rising spirit of struggle among Africans alarmed the police, who became increasingly active at these conferences, using tear gas and batons to disperse the people. Recently, the Kenyan government banned a Kikuyu organization, the People's Party, and arrested eighty-five members. Ordinary members were forced to serve seven years in prison, and leaders were imprisoned for twelve years. This organization has a broad base, with twenty-five local committees in Nairobi and the suburbs of Nairobi.

　　The article concluded: It seems that Britain intends to launch another campaign of terror against the Africans of Kenya. But past facts have shown that no matter how many Africans are killed or imprisoned, new leaders will rise to take their place.

    反抗英国的恐怖和欺骗政策
    怯尼亚人民英勇斗争
    新华社7日讯　约翰内斯堡消息：南非进步杂志“新世纪”周刊前些时候发表了一篇文章，详细论述了非洲怯尼亚人民为争取政治上的平等权利而进行的斗争。
    文章说：半个多世纪以来，怯尼亚的非洲人一直在为反对当地白种居民的压迫政权而进行英勇坚决的斗争。到1950年，成千上万非洲人响应了肯雅塔领导的“怯尼亚非洲人联盟”的号召，为争取平等而进行英勇的斗争。非洲各工会也拥有大批会员，而且组织得很好。
    英国当时正在认真地考虑使怯尼亚成为它在非洲的主要基地之一，因此决定要粉碎非洲人的解放运动。英国镇压的第一目标是工会，其次是“怯尼亚非洲人联盟”。肯雅塔由于支持“茅茅”组织（编者注：怯尼亚土著人民的武装爱国组织）的活动而被判处七年徒刑。接着便展开了非洲大陆悲惨的历史上最恐怖的镇压运动之一。五年来，“茅茅”的成员一直遭到追击。一万多个非洲人被杀害了，七万个非洲人被囚禁在集中营里。
    到1955年，英国认为它可以使英国和其他地方对它在殖民地的残酷镇压感到非常恐怖的人们平静下来了。因此，英国便找了一些“温和”的非洲人，宣布准备同他们共同实施“新政”。
    一批经过挑选的非洲人获得了投票权，他们在立法会议中获得了八个议席。年轻的工会领袖姆博亚就是英国和怯尼亚的欧洲殖民者寄予希望的“温和”非洲人之一。姆博亚曾经抨击“茅茅”，然而，怯尼亚所有非洲人想为自身争取广泛的权利的要求是如此迫切，以致姆博亚的发言开始比以前强硬了。
    在去年年初举行的选举中，以姆博亚为首的一批候选人使英国又惊又恨，因为他们击败了他们的“温和”派对手，选民们认为这些对手只是白种殖民者的走狗而已。
    立法会议新当选的非洲议员在列席后立即要求增加非洲人在立法会议中的代表席位。
    同时，全国各地纷纷举行非洲人大会，表示充分支持姆博亚议员集团的要求。
    于是，英国殖民地大臣伦诺克斯—波伊德便前往怯尼亚，并且在同那边的欧洲人合作的情况下拟就了增加立法会议中的非洲人代表的新方案。但是，他在拟订新方案时并未跟非洲人商量。
    非洲人的要求是要在立法会议中占多数。但是，新方案只规定非洲人拥有同欧洲人人数相等的代表席位，而在非常重要的部长会议中却只占少数。此外，方案规定成立一个“特别国家委员会”，主要由白种殖民者控制，他们拥有巨大的权力来搁置和修正几乎所有的法律。非洲人拒绝接受这个新方案。非洲议员的立场在怯尼亚首府内罗毕和其他地方举行的许多大会上得到了充分的支持。
    非洲人的斗争精神的不断高涨使警察感到惊慌，他们在这些大会上日益活跃起来，用催泪弹和警棍把人们驱散。最近，怯尼亚政府禁止了吉古宇族的一个组织——人民党，逮捕了八十五名党员。强使一般党员坐牢七年，领袖坐牢十二年。这个组织拥有广泛的基础，在内罗毕和内罗毕的郊区有二十五个地方委员会。
    文章最后说：看来英国打算对怯尼亚非洲人再度展开恐怖运动。但是过去的事实表明，不管多少非洲人被杀害或囚禁，新的领袖将起来接替他们的地位。
