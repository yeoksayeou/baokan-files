    The Scenery of Spring is Infinitely Good, the Situation Changes Daily
    Zhou Xiaozhou, First Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee, Talks About His Impressions of Spring Ploughing Inspection

    (Reported by this newspaper) The spring ploughing production inspection teams jointly formed by the Hunan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China and the local Party committees have completed their inspections in various places and are reporting the inspection results to the Provincial Party Committee. On March 29, Comrade Zhou Xiaozhou, head of the inspection team and First Secretary of the Hunan Provincial Party Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke to reporters about his observations during this inspection.

    Comrade Zhou Xiaozhou excitedly told reporters that after more than 20 days of inspection by the provincial inspection team, the overall impression of everyone was that the province, both urban and rural areas, presented a new atmosphere. The situation was very good, filled with a prosperous, joyful, and leaping-forward scene everywhere. He used two sentences to summarize this scene: "The scenery of spring is infinitely good, and the situation changes daily." The broad masses of peasants are full of confidence in a bumper harvest in agricultural production this year. They describe this year's production as: "People are of one mind, water conservancy is good, fertilizer is abundant, technology is strong, the season is early, and a bumper harvest is definitely hopeful." These few sentences clearly summarize the spring ploughing production this year.

    After analyzing the current situation, Comrade Zhou Xiaozhou talked about several issues that should be worked hard on in the current work.

              Do a Good Job in Political and Ideological Work

    First, we must continue to boldly mobilize the masses and do a good job in political and ideological work. He said: After the mass rectification movement since last year, the socialist enthusiasm of more than 90% of the peasants is unprecedentedly high, and the broad masses of cadres are working hard and deeply delving into their work, striving to achieve a great leap forward. All of this is very good. However, there should never be any complacency or emotions similar to complacency, because the ideological awareness of the masses needs to be continuously improved step by step. The power of the masses is endless, and the work of mobilizing the masses can never have an end. In the advancing process of any revolutionary movement, the ideological awareness of the masses is often unbalanced. At the beginning, some people are ideologically advanced and stand at the forefront of the movement; some people follow the trend and run with the movement, understanding as they go; and there are also some people who do not understand at the beginning but understand in the end. When the movement progresses to a new stage, the same process will occur again. Such cycles are repeated, mobilized repeatedly, and continuously improved to continuously promote the development of the revolutionary cause. The great leap forward in production itself is a revolutionary mass movement, which requires us to constantly put forward new tasks based on the development of the situation, constantly boldly mobilize the masses, and do more detailed work in mobilizing the masses.

    The central task of further mobilizing the masses at present is to vigorously prepare for rice transplanting and rapidly and comprehensively develop diversified operations. This requires: boldly mobilizing the masses to earnestly do a good job in the "three guarantees" and "five to the fields," so that the plan can take root among the masses and let the masses shoulder the burden of high yield; boldly mobilizing the masses to carry out tool reform and other technological innovations to improve work efficiency and solve the shortage of labor, and actively improve farming techniques to ensure the realization of the plan.

    He said: Caring for the lives of the masses is an important aspect of mobilizing the masses. Some peasants have not seriously implemented the planned grain consumption and saving grain, resulting in insufficient existing rations; some peasants are busy with spring ploughing and lack pocket money, and illnesses occur. All of these should be actively helped by the masses themselves to seek solutions.

    Implementing Technological Revolution is the Inevitable Trend of Production Leap Forward

    Second, we must vigorously carry out agricultural technological revolution. The technological revolution is another great revolution to further improve productivity and develop production after the basic completion of socialist transformation. It is an inevitable trend in the development of the great leap forward in production. The tool reform movement that is currently vigorously developing in rural Hunan is an important beginning of the technological revolution. The issue of reforming tools has been raised along with the issue of labor shortage in the production leap forward. For example, according to the requirements for realizing the great leap forward plan, the "labor deficit" in Xiangtan Prefecture is more than 30%, and the "labor deficit" in Changning County is more than 40%; the same situation exists widely in other places. If this problem is not solved, the leap forward may be dragged down. To solve this problem, we cannot rely solely on increasing labor intensity, but must take various measures, especially carrying out tool reform and technological revolution. He said that we have socialist industry as the basic reliance for technological revolution; the realization of agricultural cooperativization and large-scale production can highly promote the enthusiasm and creative wisdom of the masses; all of these provide very favorable conditions for technological revolution. Now, there have been many creations and inventions in various places: Since the beginning of spring, Changning County and Chen County have realized county-wide cartization in a very short time; Han Gongdu Township in Changde County mobilized the masses to fight hard for a month and realized "water transportization." This proves that the broad masses of people already have an urgent demand for technological revolution. As long as we strengthen leadership and mobilize them, it can quickly produce huge results.

    The main contents of the agricultural technological revolution are to reform tools and to innovate agricultural farming systems and methods. The guiding principle for carrying out the technological revolution is to mobilize all the people and the whole party; to plan comprehensively and arrange in stages, from near to far, combining the near and the far; from small to large, combining the large and the small. First of all, we must seize the problems that urgently need to be solved in the current production leap forward, and at the same time, we must study and prepare for the problems that will be encountered in the next stage of production in advance. The basic idea of ​​carrying out the technological revolution is still to boldly mobilize the masses, boldly envision, boldly innovate, and boldly create, so that the demands and creations of the masses are combined with scientific and technical knowledge. Summarize and promote local advanced experiences, and at the same time, learn and promote the experiences of other places with an open mind.

          Strengthen the Operation and Management of Agricultural Cooperatives

    Third, we must further do a good job in the operation and management of agricultural cooperatives. Because production is developing by leaps and bounds, the operation and management work must also be continuously improved to meet the needs of the production leap forward. For example, in terms of production plans, some agricultural cooperatives still have the phenomenon of fighting alone, grasping grain production and losing other production; in the use of labor, some agricultural cooperatives do not arrange semi-labor and incidental labor properly, or concentrate all the labor time of members on collective production, and do not make appropriate arrangements for the production of members' private plots and certain household chores and sideline occupations; in terms of funds, some agricultural cooperatives feel that funds are lacking, but in fact, it is due to the lack of specific arrangements for funds and finances. For example, some cooperatives have calculated the cost of planting late rice into the current expenses, or plan to buy a lot of pigs, but in fact, they cannot buy so many, so of course they feel that funds are insufficient. At present, all regions should vigorously do a good job in the "three guarantees" and "five to the fields," and through mobilizing the masses, study planting plans to make them more comprehensive; study the reasonable arrangement of labor and the reasonable use of funds.

              Vigorously Develop Diversified Economies

    Fourth, taking grain production as the center and comprehensively developing agriculture, forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations is the guiding principle for the development of agricultural production in Hunan. Comrade Zhou Xiaozhou said that at present, the broad masses of peasants urgently demand a comprehensive leap forward in diversified operations. Agricultural cooperatives throughout the province should universally seize the opportunity to actively expand the planting of annual cash crops in mountainous and dry land areas; in many places, agricultural cooperatives can draw out a certain amount of labor to organize specialized teams or capital construction teams to appropriately reclaim some wasteland; individual places can also consider drawing out a very small number of rain-fed fields and barren fields that are not suitable for planting rice to expand the planting of annual cash crops, so that the income after autumn will definitely be considerable. In addition to developing large-scale breeding industries such as cattle, pig, and fish farming, all regions in the province should also quickly and universally develop silkworm, bee, and rabbit farming in large quantities. These types of breeding industries have low costs and high profits, and develop rapidly. All localities and agricultural cooperatives should determine the proportion of agriculture, forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations that are coordinated and developed in a comprehensive leap forward according to local conditions, overall planning, and appropriate consideration. We must have a long-term perspective, start now, and not only have long-term development plans, but also start from enlivening the current rural economy and carry out diversified operations that will bring benefits in the near future and after autumn.
  Formulate Long-Term
    Comprehensive Production Plans
    Fifth, in addition to having annual plans for agricultural production, we must also have long-term—five-year or ten-year—comprehensive production development plans. This will enable us to fully and rationally utilize and exploit various production potentials and natural resources and avoid blindness in production development. For example, the planting system for fields and land, the composition ratio of various grain crops, and the development ratio of agriculture, forestry, fishery, animal husbandry, and sideline occupations must all have overall plans and comprehensive arrangements that combine long-term plans with current plans. In the utilization of mountains and forests, we should have an overall plan for what areas should develop economic forests, what areas should develop timber forests, what areas should develop feed forests, fertilizer forests, and firewood forests, what areas should be reserved as pastures, and what areas are planned to be reclaimed for cultivation, so as not to plant trees this year and have to dig up the trees next year to reclaim wasteland. Another example is the fertilizer problem. This year, we have accumulated a large amount of coarse fertilizers such as pond mud, ditch mud, vegetable soil, and turf. The amount of coarse fertilizer that can be picked next year will be relatively reduced. Production will still have a big leap forward next year. If the amount of coarse fertilizer is reduced, the amount of refined fertilizer must be greatly increased. In this way, we must reserve green manure seeds now and prepare to greatly expand the planting of green manure after autumn. This year, we must greatly expand the pig-raising industry and greatly increase manure fertilizer. The development of the pig-raising industry must solve the problem of feed supply, which requires the coordinated development of feed crops in agriculture. In short, if a certain production leaps forward and breaks the old balance, other aspects of production and work must catch up to achieve a new balance. This will better realize the great leap forward. The long-term and comprehensive plan requires leaders to carefully study in advance, make a general plan, and then hand it over to the masses, boldly mobilize the masses to discuss, enrich, supplement, and revise the final plan.
  Party and Government Organs Must Make Overall Arrangements and Lead the Comprehensive Leap Forward
    Sixth, the great leap forward in agricultural production is a link that affects the national economy, culture, and life of the entire province. The reform of agricultural tools and technological innovation proposed by the great leap forward in agricultural production requires strong support from all aspects. The increasing grain and light industrial raw materials provided by the great leap forward in agriculture, the increase in rural capital accumulation, and the growth in rural purchasing power will promote the great leap forward and great development of industry, handicrafts, commerce, transportation, and scientific, cultural, educational, and health undertakings. In this way, all tasks will promote each other, support each other, and form a magnificent situation of a comprehensive leap forward in economic, cultural, and political life, which is a brand new situation. Comrade Zhou Xiaozhou finally said that leading organs at all levels must fully estimate and utilize this very favorable new situation, more consciously grasp the center, drive the overall situation, make overall arrangements, and lead the comprehensive leap forward.
    Seventh, at present, all localities and cadres at all levels in the province have made great improvements in leadership methods. During this provincial party committee inspection team contacted many fresh things in various places, and discovered and solved many problems in a timely manner. A common new situation discovered by the provincial party committee inspection team below is that the houses of county and township organs are empty. This situation is in sharp contrast to the situation last year when the houses of county and township organs were not enough to live in. This shows that the cadres have gone deep into agricultural cooperatives and fields. More than 300,000 cadres in the province planted more than 550,000 mu of experimental fields, which are generally well done. The situation of the great leap forward in agricultural production is a climax followed by another climax. At present, early and mid-season rice throughout the province have been universally and massively soaked and put into mud. Cultivating strong seedlings and protecting seedlings is the top priority and must be vigorously grasped. We must not slacken the management and harvesting of spring-harvested crops, and we must strive to achieve the first bumper harvest this year; we must firmly grasp the various agricultural tasks before and after rice transplanting, and we must make good arrangements for labor, organizational preparations, and material preparations; diversified operations must be immediately and comprehensively launched.

    春光无限好　形势日日新
    湖南省委第一书记周小舟谈春耕检查观感
    本报讯　中共湖南省委和各地委联合组成的春耕生产检查团，已在各地检查完毕，正向省委汇报检查情况。3月29日，检查团团长、中共湖南省委第一书记周小舟同志向记者畅谈了这次检查工作的观感。
    周小舟同志十分兴奋地告诉记者：省检查团通过二十多天的检查，大家的总印象是：全省无论城市和乡村都是气象一新，形势很好，到处洋溢着兴旺、欢欣和跃进的景象。他用两句话概括地描述了这种景象：“春光无限好、形势日日新”。广大农民对今年农业生产大丰收充满了信心，他们描述今年的生产是“人心齐，水利好，肥料多，技术强，季节早，丰收硬是有希望。”这几句话鲜明地为今年春耕生产作了一个很好的总结。
    周小舟同志分析了当前形势之后，就谈到当前工作中应该努力做好的几个问题。
              做好政治思想工作
    第一、必须继续放手发动群众，做好政治思想工作。他说：经过去年以来的全民整风运动，现在90％以上的农民社会主义积极性空前高涨，广大干部则是苦干、深钻，为实现大跃进而奋发努力，这一切都是很好的。但是，决不应该有任何骄傲自满或者类似骄傲自满的情绪，因为群众的思想觉悟有待一步一步地不断提高。群众的力量是无穷无尽的，发动群众的工作就决不可能有止境。在任何一个革命运动的前进过程中，群众的思想觉悟往往是不平衡的。开始一部分人思想先进，站在运动的前列；一部分人随大流跟着运动跑，边走边通；也还有一部分人是开始不通、最后才通。当运动进展到一个新的阶段，又会出现同样的过程。如此循环不已，反复发动，不断提高，才能不断推动革命事业的发展。生产大跃进本身就是一个革命的群众运动，这就要求我们根据形势的发展，不断提出新的任务，不断放手发动群众，在发动群众上做更多更细致的工作。
    当前进一步发动群众的中心课题是：大力作好插秧的准备工作，迅速全面开展多种经营。这就要求：放手发动群众认真做好“三包”和“五到丘”的工作，让计划在群众中落脚生根，让群众挑起丰产的担子；放手发动群众进行工具改革以及其他技术的革新，以提高工效，解决劳力不足，积极改进耕作技术，保证计划的实现。
    他说：关心群众生活，是发动群众的一个重要方面。有些农民没有认真执行计划用粮和节约用粮，以致现有口粮不足；有些农民忙于春耕，缺少零用钱，以及发生疾病等等，这些都应该积极地帮助群众、依靠群众自己的力量求得解决。
    实行技术革命是生产跃进的必然趋势
    第二、要大力进行农业技术革命。技术革命是在社会主义改造基本结束后，进一步提高生产力，发展生产的又一伟大革命，是生产大跃进的形势发展的必然趋势。目前湖南农村已经蓬勃开展的工具改革运动，就是技术革命的重要开端。改革工具问题，是随着生产跃进中劳力不足的问题被提出来的。如按照实现大跃进计划的要求，湘潭专区的“劳动赤字”就在30％以上，常宁县的“劳动赤字”就在40％以上；其他地方也普遍存在同样情况。这个问题不解决，跃进就可能被拖下来。解决这个问题，不能单靠增加劳动强度，必须采取多种措施，特别是进行工具改革、进行技术革命。他说，我们有社会主义工业作为技术革命的基本依靠；农业实现了合作化，大规模的生产能够高度发挥群众的积极性和创造智慧；这些都为技术革命提供了非常有利的条件。现在各地已经有了许多创造发明：入春以来，常宁县、郴县在很短的时间内就实现了全县车子化；常德县韩公渡乡发动群众苦战一月，就实现了“水运化”。这证明广大群众对技术革命已经有了迫切要求，只要我们加强领导，加以发动，很快就能产生巨大效果。
    农业技术革命的主要内容，一是改革工具，一是革新农业耕作制度和方法。开展技术革命的方针是全民动员，全党动手；全面规划，分段安排，由近到远，远近结合；由小到大，大小结合。首先必须抓住解决当前生产大跃进中最迫切需要解决的问题，同时对下一步生产中即将遇到的问题，事先加以研究和准备。开展技术革命的基本思想，仍然是要放手发动群众，大胆设想，大胆革新，大胆创造，使群众的要求、创造和科学、技术知识结合起来。总结推广本地的先进经验，同时要虚心学习、推广外地的经验。
          加强农业社的经营管理
    第三、必须进一步作好农业社的经营管理工作。因为生产在飞跃发展，经营管理工作也必须不断提高，才能适应生产跃进的需要。例如生产计划方面，目前有些农业社仍有单打一的现象，抓了粮食生产，丢了其他生产；在劳动力的使用上，有的农业社对半劳动力和附带劳动力的安排不恰当，或者把社员的劳动时间全部集中搞集体生产，对社员自留地的生产和某些家务、家庭副业劳动没有适当安排；在资金方面，有些农业社感到资金缺乏，实际是由于缺乏资金财务的具体安排。如有的社把种晚稻的费用也算到目前的开支中了，或者计划买猪很多、而实际又买不到那么多，当然就感到资金不足了。当前各地区应该大力作好“三包”“五到丘”的工作，通过发动群众，研究种植计划，使之更为全面；研究劳动力的合理安排，研究资金的合理使用。
              大力发展多种经济
    第四、以粮食生产为中心，全面开展农、林、渔、牧、副业多种经营，是湖南发展农业生产的方针。周小舟同志说，目前广大农民迫切要求多种经营全面大跃进。全省农业社应该普遍抓紧在山地和旱土积极扩种一年生的经济作物；许多地方可以由农业社抽出一定劳力组织专业队或基本建设队，适当开些荒土；个别地方还可以考虑抽出极少数不适宜种稻谷的天水田和瘦田来扩种一年生的经济作物，这样在秋后的收入，就一定会大有可观。全省各地在发展养牛、养猪、养鱼等大宗饲养业外，还要尽速普遍大量发展养蚕、养蜂和养兔，这类饲养业是本小利大，发展迅速。各地各个农业社都应该因地制宜、统筹兼顾、适当确定农、林、渔、牧、副业多种经营配合发展，全面跃进的比例。要从长远着眼，目前下手，既要有长远的发展规划，又要从活跃当前农村经济出发，大量开展目前和秋后即有收益的多种经营。
  制定长远的
    全面生产规划
    第五、农业生产除了要有全年的计划，还一定要有长远的——五年或者十年的全面生产发展规划。这样才能充分合理地利用和发挥各种生产潜力和自然资源，避免生产发展的盲目性。譬如田、土的种植制度，各类粮食作物的构成比例，农、林、渔、牧、副业的发展比例，都要有通盘规划、全面安排，远景规划和当前计划结合。在山林的利用上，什么地方应该发展经济林，什么地方应该发展用材林，什么地方应该发展饲料林、肥料林、薪炭林，什么地方应该留作牧场，以及什么地方准备开作耕地，都应该有个通盘的打算，合理安排，这样才不致今年栽了树，明年又要挖树开荒。又如肥料问题，今年我们积了大量的塘泥、沟泥、菜土、草皮等粗肥，明年能挑的粗肥就会相对的减少。明年生产还要大跃进，粗肥数量少了，精肥就一定要大大增加。这样，目前就要预留绿肥种子，准备秋后大量扩种绿肥。今年就要大大扩展养猪业，大量增加厩肥。而养猪业的发展又必须解决饲料供应问题，这就要求在农业上配合发展饲料作物。总之，某项生产跃进了，打破了旧的平衡，其他方面的生产和工作就得迎头赶上，以达到新的平衡。这样才能更好地实现大跃进。长远的全面的规划需要领导事先仔细研究，作出一个大体的方案，然后交给群众，放手发动群众讨论、丰富、补充，修正定案。
  党政机关要通盘部署，领导全面大跃进
    第六、农业生产大跃进是一个牵动全省国民经济、文化生活的环节，农业生产的大跃进所提出的改革农具、革新技术，要求各方面大力支援；农业大跃进后所提供的日渐增多的粮食和轻工业原料，农村资金积累的增加，农村购买力的增长，又将促进工业、手工业、商业、交通运输业以及科学、文化、教育、卫生各方面事业的大跃进、大发展。这样，各项工作将彼此互相促进推动，互相支援，形成一个波澜壮阔的全面经济、文化、政治生活大跃进的形势，这是一个崭新的形势。周小舟同志最后说，各级领导机关必须充分估计到和利用这个十分有利的新形势，更自觉地抓住中心，带动全面，通盘部署，领导全面大跃进。
    第七、现在全省各地，各级干部在领导方法上已有很大的改进。这次省委检查团在各地接触了很多新鲜事物，及时发现和解决了不少问题。省委检查团在下边发现的一种普遍的新情况，是县、乡机关的房子都是空空的，这个情况与去年县、乡机关房子不够住的情况，恰恰成一个鲜明的对比，这就说明干部都深入到农业社和田间去了。全省三十多万干部种的五十五万多亩试验田，一般搞得好。农业生产大跃进的局面是一个高潮紧接一个高潮。当前全省早、中稻已经普遍大量浸种下泥，培育壮秧、护秧工作是当务之急，要大力抓紧，对于春收作物的管理和收割不能松劲，一定要努力实现今年头一个丰收；插秧和插秧前后各项农事工夫要切实抓紧，要作好劳力安排、组织准备和物质准备；多种经营要立即全面开展起来。
