    Double-Layer Double-Share Plow is a Good Tool for Deep Plowing
    (Our report) The Advanced First Agricultural Cooperative of Zengfumiao Township, Changge County, Henan Province, created a double-layer double-share plow, which improved the labor efficiency of deep plowing.
    The shape of this plow is similar to that of an ordinary new-style walking plow. The only difference is that behind the guide wheel, in a straight line, two plowshares of different heights are installed. When plowing, the front plow can plow eight inches deep, turning the topsoil on the surface to the right; the rear plow can plow another seven inches deep based on the eight-inch depth plowed by the front plow, loosening the soil. Because the front and rear plows have a clear division of labor, it will not be like ordinary plows that deeply plow the land, turning the fertile soil on the surface to the underground and the raw soil to the top, affecting the growth of crops. The cost of this plow is very low, each costing only seven yuan. Using two to three head of livestock to pull the plow and one person to hold the plow, three mu of land can be plowed in one day to a depth of one and a half feet. In the past, using manual labor, eight people could only plow one mu a day.
    Deep plowing is a major measure to ensure increased agricultural production. This year, the Changge County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party promptly promoted the creation of the Advanced Agricultural Cooperative of Zengfumiao Township, and all 300,000 mu of autumn land in the county were universally deeply plowed once using the double-layer double-share plow.

    双层双铧犁是深耕好工具
    本报讯　河南省长葛县增福庙乡先进第一农业社创造双层双铧犁，提高了深翻土地的劳动效率。
    这种犁形状和通常的新式步犁相似。只是在导轮的后面，在直线上，安装两个高低不同的犁铧。耕地时，前犁能耕八寸深，把地面上的表土翻在右面；后犁在前犁耕过的八寸深的基础上，又可深耕七寸，把土穿松。由于前后两犁有明确分工，就不会像一般犁深翻土地时那样，把地面熟土翻到地下，生土翻到上面，影响作物的生长。这种犁的成本很低，每个造价只合七元。用两头至三头牲口曳犁，一人扶犁，一天能翻地三亩，深一尺半。而过去用人工翻，八个人一天只能翻一亩。
    深翻土地是保证农业增产的一项主要措施。今年，中共长葛县委会及时推广了增福庙乡先进农业社的创造，全县的三十万亩大秋地都运用双层双铧犁普遍深翻了一次。
