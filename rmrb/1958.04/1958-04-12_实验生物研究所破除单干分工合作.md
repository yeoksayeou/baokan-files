The scientists at the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Experimental Biology have broken away from the previous twelve separate, individualistic units. All research personnel are now organized according to the four major center research projects, combining their academic expertise to collaborate and ensure the rapid progress of the institute's major research endeavors. The institute has also changed its attitude of acting as an authority and waiting for others to approach them. Instead, it has proactively contacted Fudan University, accepting the task of organizing embryology courses for Fudan University's Biology Department and guiding students' graduation theses and internships. The deputy director of the institute, renowned embryologist Zhuang Xiaohui, has been appointed as the director of the Embryology Teaching and Research Group of Fudan University's Biology Department.

    实验生物研究所破除单干分工合作
    中国科学院实验生物研究所的科学家们打破过去按人设事的十二个小摊子，全所研究人员按四大中心研究项目，结合自己的学术专长，组织起来分工合作，保证全所重大研究工作的迅速进展。这个所还改变了权威自居、等别人找上门的态度，主动联系复旦大学，接受为复旦大学生物系组织胚胎学课程和指导学生毕业论文、实习等任务，由副所长、著名胚胎学家庄孝僡担任复旦大学生物系胚胎学教研组主任。
