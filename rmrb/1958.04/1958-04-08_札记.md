Notes

Empty Talk

    The "New York Herald Tribune," in its editorial, admitted that Japan urgently needed to expand its export trade and believed that the "trade restrictions" imposed on it by the United States were "unrealistic." However, the editorial writer also considered the trade agreement signed between Japan and China "terrible." It turns out that he and those "unrealistic" people who wanted to "restrict" Japanese trade were birds of a feather.

    What to do? He offered a plan, saying: "If the free world is willing to use its economic resources on the basis of enlightened, truly reciprocal trade, it may simultaneously establish economically sound regions...and reduce the dangerous temptation to trade with the Communist bloc under the pressure of pure need." He also suggested that the United States should lead this movement, "treating it as a very wise measure." But it is precisely the United States that has greatly rejected Japanese goods, from canned tuna to shirts, from plywood to children's toys, and this is intensifying. In the eyes of American businessmen, competition in the business world is far more realistic than any "wise measure." Therefore, this editorial writer was just talking empty words.

Shameful Degeneration

    The Paris "Le Monde" recently quoted a French officer in an article discussing the situation of the Algerian War: "Algeria is almost equal to France in 1942." The newspaper then explained: 1942 was the year when the French anti-Nazi underground armed forces established a unified military organization.

    Since the current Algeria is equal to France in 1942, then the current France should of course be equal to Germany under Hitler's rule. And that's exactly the case. Aren't the actions of the French colonial army in Algeria a replica of the Nazi atrocities of the past? Moreover, some French officers in Algeria have even openly identified themselves as "Gestapo."

    For the French government to turn France, which was ravaged by the Nazis, into a successor to the Nazi tradition is a shameful degeneration! However, it should be reminded that the days of the Nazi collapse were not far from 1942. If the French "Nazis" do not immediately lay down their butcher knives, are they waiting for the fate of the Nuremberg trials?

Sovereignty Fire Sale

    Turkish Foreign Minister Fatin Rüştü Zorlu recently publicly stated that the Turkish government would agree to establish missile bases on its territory, and that "regardless of the number and location of missile launchers, the Turkish government will accept the orders of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization." This means that the Western bloc can build as many missile bases as it wants in Turkey, and they can be built anywhere they want, and Turkey will obey.

    The attitude of the Turkish government is really "generous." But there are all kinds of generosity in the world, some are generous with help, some send charcoal in the snow, but Turkey is neither generous nor sending charcoal, but offering its own country. The Turkish rulers are bent on being a submissive tool for the U.S. military expansion and war preparation plan, and they are selling off their sovereignty.

    札记
    空话
    “纽约先驱论坛报”在它的社论里承认日本急需扩大出口贸易，并且认为美国加给它的“贸易限制是不现实的”，但是这位社论作者又认为日本同中国签订的贸易协定“糟得很”，原来他跟那些想“限制”日本贸易的“不现实”派是一丘之貉。
    怎么办呢？他献了一计，说：“如果自由世界愿意在开明、真正互惠贸易的基础上动用它的经济资源，它可能同时建立经济健全的地区……并减少在单纯需要的压力下同共产党集团贸易的危险诱惑。”他还建议，美国应当领导这个运动，“把它当作一种非常明智的措施”。可是恰恰是美国，对于日本货，从鲔鱼罐头到衬衫，从三合杉到儿童玩具，都大加排斥，而且愈演愈烈。在美国商人看来，生意场上的竞争，远比什么“明智的措施”现实得多。所以，这位社论作者只是说了一番空话罢了。
    可耻的堕落
    巴黎“世界报”最近在一篇论述阿尔及利亚战争形势的文章里引用了一个法国军官的话：“阿尔及利亚差不多等于1942年的法国。”这家报纸接着解释道：1942年，正是法国反纳粹地下武装建立统一的军事机构的一年。
    既然目前的阿尔及利亚等于1942年的法国，那末目前的法国当然应该等于希特勒统治下的德国了。事实也的确如此。法国殖民军队在阿尔及利亚的作为，难道不正是过去纳粹暴行的翻版吗？而且，某些在阿尔及利亚的法国军官，甚至已经公然以“盖世太保”自居了。
    法国政府让当年受纳粹蹂躏的法国一变而为纳粹传统的继承者，这是一种多末可耻的堕落啊！然而，应该提醒他们的是，1942年离纳粹垮台的日子已经不太远了，法国“纳粹”如不立即放下屠刀，难道是要等到纽伦堡审讯的下场吗？
    主权大拍卖
    土耳其外交部长法丁·吕斯图·佐鲁最近公开地说，土耳其政府将同意在它的境内建立导弹基地，而且“无论导弹发射台的数目和地点，土耳其政府都将接受北大西洋公约组织的命令”。这就是说，西方集团在土耳其的导弹基地，愿意建立多少就建立多少，而且随便在什么地方建立都可以，土耳其无不从命。
    土耳其政府的这种态度真够上“慷慨”二字了。但世界上有各式各样的慷慨，解囊相助者有之，雪里送炭者有之，土耳其则不是解囊，又不是送炭，而是奉送自己的江山。土耳其统治者一心想当美国扩军备战计划的顺从工具，竟不惜来个主权大拍卖。
