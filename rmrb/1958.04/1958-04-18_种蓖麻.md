Planting Castor Beans
	Wan Qing
	You have a spare piece of land in your yard, what will you plant this year? Vegetables? Flowers? It's best to plant castor beans. Planting castor beans has great benefits, for both industry and agriculture. Plant a seed in the spring, and harvest handfuls in the autumn. The purchasing agent will smile and say: "You are truly patriotic."

    种蓖麻
    宛青院里闲着一块地，今年你家种点啥？种点菜？种点花？最好还是种蓖麻。种蓖麻，好处大，工业农业都用它。春种一粒籽，秋收几大把。收购员见了笑哈哈：“你们真是爱国家。”
