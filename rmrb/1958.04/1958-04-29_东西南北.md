    A Prolific Sow
    Chun Jiaming, a member of the Guangming First Cooperative in Yanfeng Township, Cangxi County, Sichuan Province, raised a sow that produced seventy-one piglets in three litters last year. The first litter had twenty-five piglets, and the second and third litters each had twenty-three.

    The reason why this sow produced so many piglets is that Chun Jiaming changed the old habits of pig mating. Last year, he led the boar to the door, let it rest for a while, and then fed it a small amount of diluted feed before mating. After the first mating, he mated again after the time it took to smoke a pipe. In addition, he was also very particular about how he raised the sow, making sure the pigsty was well-ventilated and kept very clean. Cangxi County is now widely promoting this advanced method.

    Guoyuan Cooperative Implements Deep Burial on Flat Ground
    Not long ago, the Guoyuan Agricultural Cooperative in Sanhe Township, Jinshi Suburbs, Hunan Province, with the unanimous agreement of all its members, adopted the method of mutual assistance in relocating graves and deep burial on flat ground (burying the coffins deeper and leveling the mounds above ground). In four days, they completely dealt with one thousand five hundred and six graves, adding a total of sixty-four mu of cultivated land.
    Folk saying: Plant sesame seeds during Little Fullness, and yield 1.8 shi per mu; plant sesame seeds during dog days, and the tops will be full of flowers.

    Mountain Area Gets Tap Water
    Members of the Yuexing First Cooperative in Baisha Township, Yangxin County, Hubei Province, are now getting tap water in the mountains.

    Yuexing Cooperative is located at the foot of Mount Ma'an, which has a spring. The members of Yuexing Cooperative used this spring water, hollowing out sections of bamboo and connecting them together, burying them in the ground to lead the water to indoor pools. The masses call this water "tap water."

    Drinking tap water is not only clean and hygienic, but also saves a lot of labor. In the past, female cooperative members spent most of their time fetching water, but now they don't have to. All the able-bodied women in the cooperative are now working.

    According to current surveys, there are four hundred and sixty-nine springs in the county, three hundred and eighty-four of which have already been utilized. (Xiang Jin'an)

    多产的母猪
    四川苍溪县烟峰乡光明一社社员淳家明喂养的一头母猪，去年三窝生了七十一只小猪。第一窝生了二十五只，二、三窝各生二十三只。
    这头母猪所以产仔特别多，是因为淳家明改变了猪配种的老习惯。去年，他把公猪牵上门，让它休息一会后，再喂少量稀调饲料，然后交配。第一次配种后，隔一袋烟时间，又配第二次。另外，他饲养母猪的方法也很讲究，猪圈通风，打扫的也很干净。苍溪县正在普遍推广这种先进方法。
    果园社实行平地深葬
    不久以前，湖南津市郊区三合乡果园农业社经过全体社员一致同意，采取互助自移、平地深葬的办法（把棺材埋深一些，把地面上的坟堆铲平），在四天内，把一千五百零六座坟墓全部处理了，共增加了六十四亩耕地。农谚小满种芝麻，亩收一石八；伏里种芝麻，头顶一把花。

    山区吃到自来水
    湖北阳新县白沙乡月星一社的社员在山上吃到自来水了。
    月星社位于马鞍山麓，山上有泉水。月星社社员就利用这股泉水，用竹子节节打通，连接起来，埋在土里，引水到室内水池子里，群众称这水为“自来水”。
    吃自来水不但清洁卫生，还节省出很多劳动力。过去女社员大部分时间花在挑水上，现在不用挑水，全社有劳力的妇女都出勤了。
    根据目前勘察结果，全县有泉水四百六十九处，已开始利用的有三百八十四处。（项金安）
