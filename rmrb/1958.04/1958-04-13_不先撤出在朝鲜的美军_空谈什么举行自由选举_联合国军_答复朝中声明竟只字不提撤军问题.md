Xinhua News Agency, April 12th -- On April 9th, the British Chargé d'Affaires in China, Mr. Humphrey Trevelyan, delivered to the Chinese Deputy Foreign Minister, Luo Guibo, a note from the British government, representing the governments of the countries in the United Nations Command, in response to the statements issued separately by the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea on February 5th and the government of the People's Republic of China on February 7th regarding the withdrawal of all foreign troops from Korea and the peaceful settlement of the Korean issue.

The note stated that the governments of the United Nations Command countries "welcomed” the statement of the Chinese People's Volunteers' withdrawal from Korea, but the note made no mention of the withdrawal of U.S. and other countries' troops from Korea. Instead, it quibbled over the issue of elections supervised by neutral nations' organizations. The note stated that the governments of these countries were willing to see free elections held under United Nations supervision for the establishment of a National Assembly, and raised some "questions" requiring "clarification" from the Korean and Chinese sides. The note said that the governments of the United Nations Command countries "would be pleased to know" whether the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, in referring to elections supervised by neutral nations' organizations, "accepts that such elections should be held under the auspices of the United Nations" and that there should be "full supervision not only of the preparations but also of the elections themselves."

The Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs has forwarded the aforementioned note to the government of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea.

    不先撤出在朝鲜的美军
    空谈什么举行自由选举
    “联合国军”答复朝中声明竟只字不提撤军问题
    新华社12日讯　英国驻华代办文郁生4月9日向我外交部副部长罗贵波递交了英国政府代表联合国军方面各国政府答复朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府和中华人民共和国政府分别在2月5日和2月7日发表的关于从朝鲜撤出一切外国军队和和平解决朝鲜问题的两个声明的一份照会。
    照会说，联合国军方面各国政府对中国人民志愿军撤出朝鲜的声明表示“欢迎”，但是照会对美国和其他国家军队撤出朝鲜问题却只字不提，相反地在中立国机构进行监督选举的问题上进行纠缠。照会说，各该国政府愿意看到为成立国民会议在联合国监督下举行自由选举，并且提出了一些“问题”，要求朝中方面予以“澄清”。照会说，联合国军方面各国政府“将乐于知道”朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府在提到中立国机构监督选举时“是否接受此项选举应在联合国主持下举行”，“并且不仅对准备工作，而且对选举本身应有充分的监督”。
    我外交部已将上述照会转告朝鲜民主主义人民共和国政府。
