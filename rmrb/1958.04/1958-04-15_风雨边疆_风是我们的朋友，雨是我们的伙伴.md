	– The Wind is Our Friend, the Rain is Our Companion –

	In the cold wind and rain, I walked from the front hills towards Xiangzhou on a muddy road. After passing the wave-splashed beach, as I was about to approach the barracks, I saw a soldier standing guard on the pier where the boats were docked. He was wearing a raincoat, but he hadn't put the hood up. The hood was open, resting on his back like a triangular canvas bucket, almost full of rainwater.

	I approached him and asked, "Hey, why don't you put up your hood?"

	He wiped his face and said, "It's soaked anyway!"

	"Cold, isn't it?" I asked again.

	"It's alright," he squeezed his eyes and joked, "Super cool!"

	That night, the corporal and deputy squad leader returned. I learned his name was Chen Changfa, a skilled guard who had captured smugglers several times. He came into the room, quickly took off all his clothes, and rubbed his whole body vigorously with a dry towel. After wringing the water out of his clothes, he shook them a few times and put them back on.

	"Aren't you going to change?" I asked.

	"Changing a hundred times would be the same," he said. "It's been raining for half a month, and none of us in the whole squad has any dry clothes, unless we wrap ourselves in quilts!"

	That night, Chen Changfa didn't sleep a wink. Every two or three hours, he would come back in from outside and wring the water out of his clothes. In the darkness, I could hear his teeth chattering from the cold.

	Just as dawn was breaking, I heard Chen Changfa speaking loudly outside: "Haha, you little dog, you thought we'd be sleeping just because it's windy and rainy. You've got a lot of nerve, daring to sneak right under our noses!"

	It turned out that he had caught another smuggler on this windy and rainy border night.

	At this time, Private Xiao Liang said like reciting a poem: "The wind is our friend, the rain is our companion!"

	"Well said!" Chen Changfa responded loudly, patting his chest vigorously.

	"Well said!" I thought, moved. "What a heroic character!"

    风雨边疆
    ——风是我们的朋友，雨是我们的伙伴——
    惠宣
    在寒冷的风雨中，我从前山踏着泥泞的路向香洲走去。经过浪花飞溅的海滩，快要走近营房的时候，在船只停泊处的码头上，我看见一个士兵在那里站岗。他披着雨衣，但并没有把斗篷盖在头上。斗篷张开口，搁在他的背上，像一只三角形的帆布桶，差不多贮满了雨水。
    我走近他问道：“喂，干嘛不带上斗篷？”
    他抹了一把脸上的水说：“反正都湿透了！”
    “冷吧？”我又问。
    “还好，”他挤了挤眼睛，开玩笑地说：“顶凉快的！”
    夜里，这位下士副班长回来了。我知道了他叫陈长发，是个执勤能手，曾经数次抓住偷渡犯。他走进屋里来，迅速地脱尽了身上的衣服，用干毛巾使劲地擦着全身。他把衣服上的水绞干以后，抖了几下又披到身上了。
    “你不换衣服！”我问道。
    “换一百件也得湿掉，”他说：“下了半个月的雨，咱们全班人谁也没有一件干衣服了，除非把被子披上！”
    这一夜陈长发通宵未睡，他隔两三个小时就从外边回来一趟，拧掉衣服上的水。在黑暗中，我听见他冻得两排牙齿在咯咯地厮打。
    天刚亮的时候，我听见陈长发在屋外大声说话：“哈哈，这狗家伙，他以为刮风下雨咱们就睡大觉哩，天大的胆子，居然敢拱到咱们鼻子底下来了！”
    原来是他在这风雨的边疆之夜，又抓住了一个偷渡犯。
    这时列兵小梁像朗诵诗一样说：“风，是我们的朋友，雨，是我们的伙伴！”
    “说得好！”陈长发大声应道，使劲的拍了一下胸脯。
    “说得好！”我感动地想道：“多么豪迈的性格啊！”
