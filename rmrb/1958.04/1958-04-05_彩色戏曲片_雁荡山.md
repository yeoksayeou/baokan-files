    Color Opera Film "Yandang Mountain"
    The major martial arts opera "Yandang Mountain" is a Beijing opera repertoire that won an award at the First National Opera Festival. The plot is: At the end of the Sui Dynasty, the people could not bear the exorbitant taxes and levies of the ruling class, and they rose up in rebellion. Led by Meng Haigong, they defeated He Tianlong, the garrison general of Yandang Mountain, and won the victory. This play has a unique style: there are no lyrics or dialogue, only martial arts scenes. The Beijing Film Studio brought this martial arts play to the screen and produced it as a color documentary. The roles of Meng Haigong and He Tianlong in the play are played by Bai Zhiyi and Yuan Guolin, martial arts students from the China National Academy of Chinese Theatre Arts.
    The advantages of the film are: it appropriately uses scenery and photography techniques to clearly reproduce the martial arts skills performances in the play's land battles, naval battles, pursuits, and siege scenes.

    彩色戏曲片“雁荡山”
    重头武戏“雁荡山”，是第一届全国戏曲会演大会上得奖的京剧剧目。剧情是：隋朝末年，人民不堪统治阶级的横征暴敛，纷纷起义公率领下，打败了雁荡山守将贺天龙，获得胜利。这出戏具有独特风格：没有唱词、道白，完全是武打场面。北京电影制片厂把这出武戏搬上银幕，摄制成彩色纪录片。剧中孟海公和贺天龙两个角色，由中国戏曲学校学员、武生柏之毅和武净袁国林饰演。
    影片的优点是：适当地利用了布景和摄影技巧，把剧中陆战、水战、追击、攻关各场戏的武打技艺表演，清楚地再现了出来。
