Hunan Province has accumulated 22 billion dan of various fertilizers, averaging 471 dan per mu of paddy field, exceeding the total amount of fertilizer applied in the three years from 1955 to 1957 by 2 billion dan, and overfulfilling the task of accumulating 20 billion dan of fertilizer before rice transplanting set by the Provincial Party Committee.

The main characteristics of this year's fertilizer accumulation campaign are that the broad masses of peasants and cadres have displayed the vigor and determination of the socialist revolution, making every effort to expand fertilizer sources, breaking with conventions, and boldly carrying out various innovations. The "Four Diligences and Eight Possessions" fertilizer accumulation and preservation experience of Liling has been widely promoted throughout the province. Workers in various cities have also vigorously supported their peasant brothers in accumulating fertilizer. Now, fire and soil ash kilns, cattle tail stoves, dual-purpose stoves, and granular fertilizer plants have blossomed everywhere in the province. The lake weeds and tidal mud in the lake area have also been fully utilized. Changde Prefecture has also cultivated more than 200,000 mu of high-quality, high-yield perennial fertilizer - peony grass.

This year's fertilizer is not only more abundant than in previous years, but also of better quality. Various measures have been taken in various places to improve fertilizer quality. The province has collected more than 1.6 billion dan of household fertilizer, with fine fertilizer accounting for 20% in Chenxian Prefecture. Anhua County has widely mobilized the masses to search mountain caves for fertilizer accumulation. Fuxing Cooperative found eleven mountain caves and accumulated more than 50,000 dan of poultry and livestock manure. Nanxian County has widely promoted the Junhe Cooperative's method of using buckets to collect cattle urine, which is estimated to solve the fertilizer problem for more than 10,000 mu of fields. Many measures have also been taken for unfermented pond manure. Nanxian County put forward quality requirements of "stir evenly," "level evenly," "turn thoroughly," and "revive." Yuanjiang County has adopted the method of adding tea seed cake, bone meal, and ammonium sulfate to accelerate the decomposition of pond fertilizer.

    湖南跃过二百亿担积肥指标
    本报讯　湖南全省已积各种肥料二百二十亿担，平均每亩水田达四百七十一担，比1955—1957三年施肥总和还多二十亿担，超额完成了省委提出的在插秧前积肥二百亿担的任务。
    今年的积肥运动的特点，主要是广大农民群众和干部发挥了社会主义革命的干劲和钻劲，千方百计地广辟肥源，打破常规，大胆地进行了各种创举。全省普遍推广了醴陵“四勤八有”的积肥保肥经验。各个城市工人群众还大力支援农民兄弟积肥。现在，火土灰窑、牛尾灶、两用灶和颗粒肥料厂已在全省普遍开花，湖区的湖草和潮泥也得到了充分利用，常德专区还培植了二十多万亩肥质好、产量高的万年肥——芍草。
    今年的肥料不仅比往年多，而且质量也比往年好。各地采取了许多措施，提高肥料质量。全省共收集了家肥十六亿多担，郴县专区的精肥占20％。安化县普遍发动群众搜山洞积肥，复兴社找到十一个山洞共积禽兽粪五万余担；南县普遍推广了均和社吊桶积牛尿的办法，估计可解决一万多亩田的肥料；对于未沤熟的氹粪也采取了许多措施，南县提出了“翻匀”、“翻平”、“翻透”、“翻活”的质量要求。沅江县采取了加茶枯、骨粉、硫酸铵的办法，加速氹肥的腐熟。
