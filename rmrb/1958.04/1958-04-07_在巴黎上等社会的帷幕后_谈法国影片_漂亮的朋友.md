    Behind the Curtains of Parisian High Society
    —On the French Film "Bel Ami"
    Luo Dagang

    The French feature film "Bel Ami" is adapted from Guy de Maupassant's novel "Bel Ami" (or translated as "Handsome Friend," China has Li Qingya's translation). Both in terms of ideological content and artistic achievement, it is a commendable film.

    Generally speaking, French films give the impression of being light and cheerful, and even when dealing with very serious subjects, they do not make people feel depressed. As for the film "Bel Ami," its advantages are obviously not only light and cheerful, but also clear and powerful realism and simple and concise artistic expression. This credit should first be given to Maupassant, but the director Louis Daquin and the screenwriters, the French progressive writers Vladimir Pozner and Roger Vailland, also deserve a lot of credit.

    Maupassant's realistic masterpiece, after being adapted for the screen by two excellent contemporary French writers, has not only become a good film, but is also closely linked to the current situation in France. Using a famous novel published in 1885 to expose and accuse the current French reactionary ruling group of its crimes in frantically carrying out colonial wars is already a clever trick; in addition, in the process of adapting a classic novel into a film script, Vailland and Pozner showed a high degree of fidelity to Maupassant's original work. They did not add anything that was not originally in the novel, and even the development and order of the story were not changed in the slightest; they only highlighted the key plots and deleted a large number of unnecessary details. Their editing made Maupassant's style, which was already very concise, crisp, and clear, even more prominent, and strengthened the novel's ideological and combative qualities. If there is a flaw in their adaptation, it is probably that in order not to make the film any longer (which was actually necessary), they excessively compressed the plot, so that some places may seem abrupt to viewers who have not read the novel "Bel Ami" beforehand, and other places may even make people confused.

    The protagonist Duroy is a brilliant creation in Maupassant's pen. Such characters not only still exist in current French bourgeois society, but there are many of them. He is an unscrupulous careerist and adventurer, a typical "hero" of capitalist society. In his youth, he served as a junior officer in the colonies, where he learned the bestial behavior of burning, killing, and looting from the unfortunate colonial people. After retiring, he returned to Paris, initially working as a small clerk in the railway bureau, unable even to feed himself. But at that time, he had already decided that in order to satisfy his personal ambition and desires, he would use the set of bestial behaviors he had learned in the colonial army in Paris, only modifying the way they were expressed according to the circumstances of Parisian society. So he befriended a wealthy mistress and shamelessly took money from her; he seduced the wife of a deceased friend who had promoted him; in order to inherit the deceased friend's property and obtain an important position in the newspaper, he married the widow; in order to find out the secrets of the newspaper owner, he got the owner's wife into his hands and became his lover; his last trump card was to abduct the owner's daughter, using this to blackmail and extort the owner, and finally marry the owner's daughter as his wife. In this way, he not only gained huge wealth, but also became his father-in-law's accomplice in financial and political speculation. Completely like the novel, the film also ends with Duroy's grand wedding with the boss's daughter. Parisian bourgeois society watched Duroy with eyes full of respect and envy. Why not? His father-in-law Walter is not only the president of the newspaper and a bank owner, but also a powerful figure in the political arena. Many parliamentarians and ministers are in his pocket. He stirs up trouble behind the scenes, which can cause cabinet reshuffles and overthrow the prime minister. Therefore, it is only a matter of time before his son-in-law Duroy becomes a parliamentarian and minister. What is most disgusting is that the boss Walter knows that Duroy is an unscrupulous rogue and was once his wife's lover, but he still marries his daughter to him. That is because Walter himself is also a rogue, so he appreciates Duroy. The final scene of the film is of great significance, because the blessing that the bishop gives to the newlyweds at the wedding is a bitter irony of Duroy and the society he represents by this progressive film: "Your marriage is a union admired by Parisian high society. ... Your life should serve as an example to others." This passage is very long, but I don't think it is too long, because the screenwriter used this reverse technique to scold all the Duroys in France in 1885 and today. Moreover, this was not added by the screenwriter out of thin air. Maupassant's original work originally had this bishop's blessing. The screenwriter simply developed it slightly, almost adding some emphasis next to the original text.

    More importantly, both the author of the novel and the screenwriter of the film exposed the fact through Duroy's story that the financial giants and politicians in Paris collude together and use colonial wars as speculation. Before they decide to send an expeditionary force to invade an overseas area, they first send people to the area to buy large tracts of land at low prices, and when the area becomes a colony, they sell the land to colonial companies at high prices. They order the news media they control to spread rumors that the government has decided not to send an expeditionary force, causing the public bonds or securities related to this to fall in price, so as to take the opportunity to buy them in large quantities. When the news of the decision to send an expeditionary force is made public, the securities immediately rise in price, and then they are sold off in large quantities, thus gaining amazing profits overnight. They also ask reporters like Duroy to write some vulgar reports in their newspapers to promote how beautiful colonial women are, in order to attract a large number of young people to go to the colonies as cannon fodder.

    The film, based on Maupassant's novel, describes these things as happening before 1885. That was the period when the French reactionary rulers were frantically expanding their colonies overseas and carrying out military aggression. Maupassant's "Bel Ami" is a courageous anti-colonial novel published during the period when French colonialists were rampant and arrogant overseas. (The events mentioned in the novel and film about the invasion of Morocco are just a veiled reference, actually referring to the French imperialists' aggression against Annam, Madagascar, and Tunisia at that time. The large-scale invasion of Morocco began after 1907.) The film adapted by Roger Vailland and others based on Maupassant's novel was made in 1955, which was shortly after the disastrous defeat at Dien Bien Phu, when French imperialism began to brutally suppress the armed uprising of the Algerian people. This is the reason why this excellent anti-colonial film was "prohibited from all commercial and non-commercial public screenings" by the French reactionary government's film censorship committee in 1955. This action by the French government just shows that the film "Bel Ami" is enough to make the financial giants and colonialists in Paris feel a headache, and also shows that the colonial war waged by the French ruling group in 1955 is as dirty, unjust, and unpopular as the colonial war waged in 1885.

    However, the film that colonialists deeply hate is very popular among peace-loving people. Under the pressure of public opinion, the French government finally lifted the ban and allowed "Bel Ami" to be publicly screened.

    在巴黎上等社会的帷幕后
    ——谈法国影片“漂亮的朋友”
    罗大冈
    法国故事片“漂亮的朋友”是根据莫泊桑的长篇小说“漂亮朋友”（或译“俊友”我国已有李青崖的译本）改编的。无论从思想内容上看，或从艺术成就上看，都是一部值得称道的影片。
    一般地说，法国影片给人的印象是轻松愉快，即使处理很严肃的题材，也不会使人沉闷。至于电影“漂亮的朋友”，它的优点显然不仅是轻松愉快，而是明朗有力的现实主义和朴素简练的艺术表现。这功劳首先应当归功于莫泊桑，但是导演路易·达甘和编剧的法国进步作家符拉季米尔·波兹乃和罗杰·瓦扬的功劳也不小。
    莫泊桑的现实主义的名著经过两位法国当代优秀作家的改编而搬上了银幕之后，不但成为一部好影片，而且紧密结合当前法国的实际情况。利用一部发表于1885年的著名的小说，来揭发和控诉当前法国反动统治集团疯狂地进行殖民战争的罪行，这已经是不小的智巧；再加在改编古典名著为电影脚本的过程中，瓦扬和波兹乃两人表现了对莫泊桑原著的高度忠实。他们没有增加小说中原来没有的任何东西，甚至连故事发展的脉络和顺序都没有稍加变动；他们只是将关键性的情节加以突出，不十分必要的细节大量删削。经过他们的剪裁，使本来就很简洁、爽利和明快的莫泊桑的风格，显得更加突出，使小说的思想性和战斗性得到加强。如果要说他们的改编也有缺点的话，那就恐怕是为了不使影片再拉长一些（其实那是必要的），过分地压缩了情节，以致对于没有事先读过小说“漂亮朋友”的观众，有些地方可能显得突兀，另一些地方甚至会使人莫名其妙。
    主角杜洛阿是莫泊桑笔下的杰出的创造。这样的人物在目前法国资产阶级社会里不但还有，而且很多。这是个不择手段的野心家和冒险家，典型的资本主义社会的“英雄”。他年轻时在殖民地当过低级军官，在不幸的殖民地人民身上学会了烧杀劫夺那一套野兽行为。退职以后他回到巴黎，起初在铁道局当个小职员，连肚子都吃不饱。可是那时他已经决定，为了满足他的个人野心和欲望，要把他在殖民地军队中学会的那套野兽行为用在巴黎，只是把表现的方式按照巴黎社会的情况加以修改。于是他结交了有钱的情妇，无耻地从她手中取得钱花；他诱惑了曾经提拔过他的亡友的老婆；为了继承亡友的财产和取得报馆里的重要职务，他和寡妇结了婚；为了探听报社老板的秘密，他又把老板娘弄到手，成了他的情妇；他最后一张王牌是拐走了老板的女儿，借此向老板要挟诬诈，终于娶了老板的女儿为妻。这样，他不但获得巨大的财产，并且成为他丈人在金融界和政治舞台上投机倒把、兴风作浪的同谋者。完全和小说一样，影片也以杜洛阿和老板女儿的盛大婚礼为结束。巴黎的资产阶级社会用充满敬意和羡慕的眼光，注视着杜洛阿。可不是吗？他的丈人瓦尔特不但是报社的社长，银行老板，同时又是政治舞台上的把头，许多议员和部长都是他的掌中之物，他在后台兴风作浪，可以引起阁潮，推翻内阁总理。因此，他的快婿杜洛阿当议员和部长，是指日可待的事。最令人恶心的是瓦尔特老板明知杜洛阿是一个不择手段的流氓，而且曾经是他老婆的情夫，还是把女儿嫁给他。那是因为瓦尔特自己也是流氓，所以他赏识杜洛阿。影片最后的镜头是有重要意义的，因为主持婚礼的那个主教向新夫妇所致的祝词，就是这部进步的影片对杜洛阿以及他所代表的社会的辛辣的讽刺：“你们两位的婚姻，这是巴黎上等社会所赞美的一种结合。……你们的生活应当作为别人的榜样。”这一段话很长，但是我并不觉得它太长，因为编剧者用了这种反面笔法，把1885年以及今天法国所有的杜洛阿都骂了个痛快。而且这并不是编剧者凭空加的，莫泊桑的原著本来就有这一段主教的祝词，编剧者无非将他稍加发展而已，几乎等于在原文旁边加了若干着重点。
    比这更重要的是小说作者和电影编剧者都通过杜洛阿的故事揭穿了这样一个事实：巴黎的金融巨头和政客勾结一起，拿殖民战争作为投机买卖，他们在决定派远征军去侵略海外某一地区以前，先派人到当地低价收购大片地皮，等到那地区沦为殖民地以后，他们又用高价把地皮出卖给殖民公司。他们命令他们掌握中的新闻界放出谣言，说政府决定不派远征军了，使得和这方面有关的公债或证券跌价，以便乘机大量购入，等决定派远征军的消息一公开，证券立刻涨价，再大量抛出，因而在朝夕之间获得惊人的巨利。他们又在自己的报纸上叫杜洛阿之流的记者写一些下流的报道来宣传殖民地女人如何美丽，以便吸引大批青年到殖民地去充当炮灰。
    电影根据莫泊桑的小说，把这一些说成1885年以前发生的事情。那时正是法国反动统治者疯狂向海外扩充殖民地，进行军事侵略的时期。莫泊桑的“漂亮朋友”就是发表于法国殖民主义者在海外猖狂肆虐，气焰万丈时期的一部勇敢的反殖民主义小说。（小说和电影中提到侵略摩洛哥的事件，只是一种影射的说法，实际上是指法帝国主义当时对安南、马达加斯加以及突尼斯等地的侵略。对摩洛哥的大举侵略是1907年以后开始的）。罗杰·瓦扬等人根据莫泊桑的小说改编的电影是1955年拍成的，那时正是在奠边府惨败不久以后，法帝国主义又开始对阿尔及利亚人民的武装起义进行残酷的镇压。这就是这部反殖民主义的优秀影片1955年被法国反动政府的电影审查委员会“禁止商业性的和非商业性的一切公开放映”的理由。法国政府这一举动恰好说明电影“漂亮的朋友”足以使巴黎的金融巨头和殖民主义者感到头痛，同时也说明1955年法国统治集团进行的殖民战争，和1885年所进行的殖民战争是同样地肮脏、非正义和不得人心的。
    可是，殖民主义者所深恶痛绝的影片，爱好和平的人民却非常喜欢。在舆论的压迫下，法国政府到末了只好开禁，允许“漂亮的朋友”公开放映。
