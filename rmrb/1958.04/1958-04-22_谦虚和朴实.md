    Humility and Simplicity
    Lenin’s Driver, S. Giri

    Before me lies a note personally written by Lenin at the end of 1919. It reads: “Comrade Giri! Comrade Fochieva told me that Comrade Rykov ordered that you and your four assistants each receive a short leather coat, a pair of felt boots, a pair of gauntlets, and a hat today. Have you received them? Lenin.”

    The origin of this note is as follows: During the severe winter, my assistants and I were working in the garage without felt boots, gloves, or other items. Lenin paid great attention to this matter. He cared about each and every one of us.

    Lenin was most concerned and sympathetic towards others. He could promptly detect others' misfortunes, sorrows, or anxieties, and never ignored their requests, dissatisfaction, or demands. Sometimes he would ask me:

      “What’s wrong? I see you seem worried today. No, no, old chap, don’t deny it. Something must be troubling you, right!”

    After hearing these words, how could you still hide and conceal anything?

    Once he met my wife. Afterwards, he often inquired about her, asking about our child, Mishutka. When I drove Lenin to the countryside for weekend holidays, he would often say to me: “Comrade Giri, why don’t you ever bring your wife? You must invite her next time.”

    Comrade Krupskaya, like Lenin, was also a simple and sincere person. On the way to the countryside, she would always inquire in detail about my wife’s work situation at the Kremlin cooperative, housing conditions, and my relatives who remained in Petrograd.

    Lenin was particularly concerned and sympathetic towards the various needs of his comrades, seeking to improve their working and living conditions, but he himself was exceptionally simple and made no demands.

    I remember an incident. When the Soviet government moved from Petrograd to Moscow, people suggested that Lenin live in a spacious and comfortable house. But he declined the suggestion and moved into a low, small house with few rooms and only ordinary furniture.

    Another incident. The director of a state-owned farm near Moscow sent Lenin a basket of fruit when he was ill. Lenin severely criticized this “attentive” director and ordered him to immediately send the fruit to the children's health station.

    In 1921, I personally encountered the following incident in the Kremlin. In the Kremlin barbershop, several people were waiting for a haircut. Unexpectedly, Lenin also arrived. After asking who was last, he humbly sat down and took out a magazine from his pocket, reading it attentively. Someone suggested letting Lenin go first.

    “No, no, comrades, thank you,” Lenin said. “We should all abide by the rules, because these rules are what we ourselves have established. I will wait.”

    Lenin greatly disliked those who flattered him. He did not like others calling him "great" or "genius." When people praised him or cheered him at conferences or meetings, he would always frown and wave his hands repeatedly.

    “What? What?” he said, laughing, stopping those who called him “Comrade Chairman,” “Why use such fancy words, dear? “You’d better just call me by my name and patronymic, it’s very simple.” As he spoke, he smiled kindly again.

    谦虚和朴实
    列宁司机　斯·吉里
    在我面前摆着一张列宁在1919年末亲笔写的纸条。上面写着：“吉里同志！福契也娃同志告诉我，雷科夫吩咐今天发给您和您的四个助手每人一件短皮袄、一双毡靴、一双手掌套和一顶帽子，收到了没有？列宁。”
    这张字条的来由是这样的：在严寒的冬季，我和助手们在车库里工作时还没有毡靴、手套及其他东西。列宁很重视这件事。他关心着我们每一个人。
    列宁最为关心和同情别人。他能及时地发现别人的不幸，忧伤或不安情绪，对别人的请求，不满或者要求从来不采取置之不理的态度。有时他这样问我：
      “怎么啦？我看您今天有些忧愁，不，不，老兄，不要抵赖，一定有什么事使您不安，对吧！”
    听了这些话，你难道还能掩饰和隐瞒什么吗？
    有一次他认识了我的妻子。以后他就常常询问她，打听我们的小孩米舒迪卡。当我送列宁到城外度星期日假日的时候，他常对我说：“吉里同志，你为什么总是不把妻子带来，下次一定要把她请来。”
    克鲁普斯卡娅同志和列宁一样，也是个朴实和对人诚恳的人。在城外的路上，她总是详细地询问我妻子在克里姆林宫合作社工作的情况、住宅情况以及我留在彼得格勒的亲人。
    列宁特别关心和同情同志们的各种需要，设法改善他们劳动和生活的条件，可是他自己却特别朴素，什么也不讲究。
    我记起了这样一件事，当苏维埃政府从彼得格勒迁到莫斯科时，人们建议列宁住一座宽敞而舒适的房子。但是他谢绝了这个建议，并且搬到一座低矮的、房间又少、只有一般家具的房子里去了。
    还有一件事。莫斯科附近的一个国营农场场长在列宁生病的时候给他送来了一篮水果。列宁狠狠地把这个“殷勤”的场长批评了一顿，并且命令他马上把水果送到儿童保健站去。
    1921年在克里姆林宫里，我亲自碰到了这样一件事情。在克里姆林宫的理发室里，有好几个人在等候着理发。出乎意料地列宁也来了。他问了谁是最后一个以后，就谦虚地坐下来，从口袋里拿出一本杂志聚精会神地读起来了。有人建议让列宁先理。
    “不，不，同志们，谢谢你们”，列宁说：“我们都应该遵守制度，因为这些制度是我们自己制定的。我等着。”
    列宁对于那些阿谀逢迎的人非常讨厌。他不喜欢别人称他是什么“伟大的”，“天才的”。当人们在大会或会议上颂扬他或向他欢呼的时候，他总是皱着眉头，连连摇手。
    “什么？什么？”，他笑着阻止了称他为“主席同志”的人的话，“为什么用这样漂亮的字眼呢？亲爱的。”“你最好还是用姓和父名称呼我，这是很简单的。”说着他又善意地笑了。
