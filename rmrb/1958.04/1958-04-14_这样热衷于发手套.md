    So Enthusiastic About Distributing Gloves
    My younger brother is a fitter who recently transferred from a steel plant in Northeast China to the Wuhan Iron and Steel Company. In his large backpack, he was carrying white cotton gloves. According to him, they were issued monthly according to the system when he worked at that steel plant. Because they issued so many, he couldn't use them all. In more than a year, in addition to unraveling some to knit socks, he still had more than sixty pairs left. He also said that every worker in the factory had accumulated dozens of pairs of gloves, some even hundreds of pairs. From my brother's conversation, it's not hard to see that the factory is issuing too many gloves, and this needs to be corrected. Yu Kehui
    -- Better to ask him to work at your factory!
    -- Why?
    -- Only he can use up the gloves you issue.

    这样热衷于发手套
    我的弟弟是一个钳工，最近从东北一个钢厂调到武汉钢铁公司工作。在他的大背包里，装满了白线手套。据他说是在那个钢铁厂工作的时候，每月按照制度发的，因为发的太多，用不完，在一年多内除了拆织成袜子以外，还剩下六十多付。他又说厂里每个工人都积存几十付手套，有的甚至几百付。从我弟弟的谈话中，不难看出这个厂发的手套太多，需要纠正。　喻可惠
    ——最好叫他到你们厂工作！
    ——为什么？
    ——只有他才能用完你们发的手套。
