Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 24th. More than 3,000 representatives from Indonesian youth, students, veterans, workers, farmers, and women gathered at the State Palace in Jakarta on the evening of the 24th to commemorate "Anti-Colonialism Day."

    The meeting unanimously passed a resolution condemning colonialism and interference in the internal affairs of any country; demanding the dissolution of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization and other military alliances; demanding a ban on nuclear weapons testing; and opposing the establishment of missile bases in the Philippines, Asia, and other countries in the world. The resolution also expressed support for proposals regarding disarmament and the convening of a great power summit to ease international tensions. The resolution expressed support for the Conference of Independent African States and the Algerian people's struggle for independence.

    Regarding domestic issues, the resolution expressed support for the current cabinet's policy of recovering West Irian and opposing colonialism, and support for the government's suppression of rebel groups. The resolution also expressed hope for national mobilization to complete the national revolution.

    President Sukarno, Major General Nasution, Chairman of the National Front for the Liberation of West Irian, government and party leaders, diplomatic envoys and representatives of Asian-African countries and other countries to Indonesia attended the meeting.

    In his speech, President Sukarno pointed out that Indonesia is facing imperialist interference, and West Irian has not yet been recovered. However, the Indonesian people are not isolated in their struggle, they are supported by the Asian-African countries and the people of the world. All Asian-African countries are concerned about each other, so they should unite and advance side by side, igniting a raging fire of anti-colonialism until colonialism is burned to ashes.

    He pointed out that colonialism is heading for destruction and will eventually be eliminated. No one can stop the development of history.

    Nasution clearly pointed out at the meeting that Indonesia is facing interference from colonialism. He said that foreign colonialists support the "Darul Islam" army, equip Indonesian rebel groups with various new weapons, and now even provide foreign pilots to attack the Republic of Indonesia. Therefore, the Indonesian government's fight against the "Darul Islam" army, the "Revolutionary Government," and the "Charter of Comprehensive Struggle" group is equivalent to fighting a colonialist front.

    Nasution said that the Padang rebels had supplied the Aceh "Darul Islam" army with 2,000 weapons, including bazookas. Foreign colonialists also use their bombers, fighters, and pilots, posing as the "Revolutionary Government's" air force, to attack Indonesia.

    Nasution said that while we are taking measures to eliminate the rebels, foreign colonialists continue to operate around our country. Foreign submarines and warships are demonstrating in our territorial waters. Some neighboring countries also provide colonialists with the convenience of transporting weapons and using aircraft to attack Indonesia.

    He said that there are still many foreign ships appearing in Sulawesi and other areas of Indonesian territorial waters, which is also part of colonialist activity. The purpose of all these acts of interference is to overthrow the independent Republic of Indonesia. He said that the Indonesian people will certainly thwart colonialist interference.

    印度尼西亚各界纪念“反殖民主义日”
    苏加诺号召把殖民主义烧光
    纳苏蒂安谴责外国武装干涉内政
    据新华社雅加达24日电　印度尼西亚青年、学生、退伍军人、工人、农民和妇女各界的代表三千多人24日晚间在雅加达国家宫举行集会，纪念“反殖民主义日”。
    会上一致通过决议，谴责殖民主义和干涉任何国家内政的行为；要求解散东南亚条约组织和其他军事联盟；要求禁止核武器试验；反对在菲律宾、亚洲和世界的其他国家建立导弹基地。决议还表示支持关于裁军和召开大国最高级会议以缓和国际紧张局势的建议。决议表示支持非洲独立国家会议和阿尔及利亚人民争取独立的斗争。
    决议在谈到国内问题时，表示支持现内阁所奉行的收复西伊里安和反对殖民主义的政策，支持政府对叛乱集团的镇压。决议还表示希望实行全国动员来完成民族革命。
    出席会议的还有苏加诺总统、争取解放西伊里安民族阵线主席纳苏蒂安少将、政府和各党派的领导人、亚非国家和其他国家驻印度尼西亚的外交使节和代表。
    苏加诺总统在讲话时指出，印度尼西亚正面临着帝国主义干涉，西伊里安还没有收复。但是印度尼西亚人民在斗争中并不是孤立的，他们得到亚非国家和全世界人民的支持。所有亚非国家都是互相关怀的，因此它们应该团结一致，并肩前进，烧起一场反殖民主义的熊熊大火，直到把殖民主义烧光为止。
    他指出，殖民主义正在走向毁灭，它终于会被清除。没有任何人能够阻止历史的发展。
    纳苏蒂安在集会上明确指出，印度尼西亚正在面临着殖民主义的干涉。他说，外国殖民主义者支持“伊斯兰教军”，用种种新武器来装备印度尼西亚的叛乱集团，现在甚至提供外国飞行员来进攻印度尼西亚共和国。因此，印度尼西亚政府要对付“伊斯兰教军”、“革命政府”和“全面斗争约章”集团，这就等于对付一个殖民主义阵线。
    纳苏蒂安说，巴东叛乱分子已经供给亚齐“伊斯兰教军”两千件包括火箭筒在内的武器。外国殖民主义者也用他们的轰炸机、歼击机和飞行员冒充为“革命政府”的空军，攻击印度尼西亚。
    纳苏蒂安说，当我们采取扑灭叛乱分子措施的时候，外国殖民主义者继续在我们国家周围进行活动。外国潜水艇和军舰在我国领海里举行示威。某些邻国还提供殖民主义者以运输武器和用飞机攻击印度尼西亚的便利。
    他说，现在仍然有许多外国船只在苏拉威西和印度尼西亚领海的其他区域中出现，这也是殖民主义活动的一部分。所有这些干涉活动的目的都是为了推翻独立的印度尼西亚共和国。他说，印度尼西亚人民肯定会挫败殖民主义的干涉。
