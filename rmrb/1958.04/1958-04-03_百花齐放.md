    Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom
    Guo Moruo
    In the summer of 1956, I once intended to select a hundred kinds of flowers and compose a hundred poems under the title "Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom." I tried writing three poems—Peony,芍药 (sháoyào - Chinese peony), and Spring Orchid—but then put it aside. This year, I retrieved those three poems and published them. Comrades read them and encouraged me: "Take a leap forward and complete all one hundred poems!" Good, I was encouraged and resolved to complete this small task.
    Some comrades asked me: "Why did you put it aside?" The main reason is that I am not familiar with many flowers. I know the plant but not its name; I know the name but not the plant; some names and plants do not match; some I am familiar with but do not know deeply (for example, if you are asked: How many petals does a peach blossom have? I am afraid many friends cannot answer immediately), so there are difficulties.
    I have also consulted many books, but it is not easy to evoke a real feeling without seeing the actual object. Therefore, if friends from various places can help me by providing detailed information about the strange flowers and exotic plants in their areas, I would be very grateful. (March 30, 1958)
    Peony
    We are not some "King of Flowers,"
    Nor have we ever harbored "thoughts of wealth and status."
    We only thank the gardeners for their meticulous cultivation,
    That allows us to grow a thousand green leaves, stronger than the flower.
    Our flowers only have color, no fragrance,
    Regardless of whether we are "Wei Purple" or "Yao Yellow";
    After flowering, our petals scatter all over the garden,
    Truly spoiling the scenery, adding to people's melancholy.
    Daffodil
    Leaves carved from jade, silvery white flowers,
    Simple, clear, making our home everywhere.
    We are pioneers of anti-waste and anti-conservatism,
    Living frugally, living quickly, living well, living abundantly.
    People call us Daffodils, which is not wrong,
    Living on only a spoonful of water and a few pebbles.
    We are promoters, not obstructors,
    Singing a New Year song for everyone every Spring Festival.
    Cyclamen
    Please don't say we came from foreign lands,
    Coming to China, we become native-born and native-grown.
    We wholeheartedly love the Chinese people,
    They call us Radish Begonia.
    We and Autumn Begonia are sisters,
    The bright petals open in a very different way.
    A girl calls us Rabbit Flowers,
    Probably because the petals resemble rabbit ears. (Attached pictures)

    百花齐放
    郭沫若
    1956年暑间，曾经打算以“百花齐放”为题，选出一百种花来做出一百首诗。试做了三首——牡丹、芍药、春兰——便搁置了。今年我把那三首诗检出来发表过，同志们看了鼓舞我：“跃进一下，就做足一百首来！”好，我受到鼓舞，决心来完成这个小任务。
    有的同志问我：“为什么要搁置？”主要的原因是我所熟悉的花不多，有的知其实而不知其名，有的知其名而不知其实，有的名实不相符，有的虽熟而并非深知（譬如问你：桃花是几瓣？恐怕有不少朋友不能顿时回答），所以有困难。
    我也翻查了好些书籍，但不见实物总不容易引起实感。因此，各地朋友如能帮帮我的忙，把各地的奇花异卉的详细情况开示些给我，我是很希望而且很感激的。（1958年3月30日）
    牡丹
    我们并不是什么“花中之王”，
    我们也不曾怀抱过“富贵之想”。
    我们只多谢园丁们的细心栽培，
    使我们抽出了千张碧叶比花还强。
    我们的花也只有色，没有香，
    不管我们是什么“魏紫”或者“姚黄”；
    花开后我们的花瓣散满园地，
    真是有些败坏风景，增人惆怅。
    水仙花
    碧玉琢成的叶子，银白色的花，
    简简单单，清清楚楚，到处为家。
    我们是反浪费，反保守的先河，
    活得省，活得快，活得好，活得多。
    人们叫我们是水仙，倒也不错，
    只凭一勺水、几粒小石子过活。
    我们是促进派而不是促退派，
    年年春节，为大家合唱迎春歌。
    仙客来
    请不要说我们是来自外洋，
    来到中国就成为土生土长。
    我们衷心地热爱中国人民，
    他们称呼我们为萝卜海棠。
    我们和秋海棠原是姊妹行，
    鲜艳的花瓣反开十分别样。
    一位姑娘叫我们是兔子花，
    怕是花瓣和兔子耳朵相像。（附图片）
