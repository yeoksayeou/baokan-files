The "Reply" from the United Nations Command
By a commentator of this newspaper

Regarding the major proposal by the governments of North Korea and China on February 5th and February 7th, and responded to with practical actions by the Chinese People's Volunteers, that both belligerent sides in Korea withdraw their foreign troops from Korea to create favorable conditions for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, the governments of the countries on the United Nations Command side, after repeated "consultations" in Washington, belatedly presented a "reply" to the governments of North Korea and China on April 9th.

This "reply" from the U.S. government and the governments of other countries on the United Nations Command side uses extremely circuitous language and, in essence, attempts to muddle through by demanding clarification on the issue of free elections, evading their inescapable responsibility to withdraw U.S. and other countries' troops from Korea.

This note verbale expressed "welcome" to the major peaceful action of the Chinese People's Volunteers' initiative to withdraw from Korea, but avoided the issue of the withdrawal of U.S. and other countries' troops from Korea. But the problem cannot be solved by simply "welcoming" it. Nor can it be pushed aside by dragging in the issue of free elections. The whole world is now waiting for the U.S. government to answer: Will U.S. troops withdraw, and when will they withdraw from Korea? If the U.S. government does not want to prove that it has been consistently obstructing the peaceful reunification of Korea, forcibly occupying South Korea, and creating tensions in Korea, then it should immediately take the same measures as North Korea and China and withdraw all U.S. troops from Korea within the shortest possible time. Other countries that still have troops stationed in Korea have a responsibility to immediately withdraw their own troops from Korea and should also advise the U.S. government to immediately take measures to withdraw U.S. troops from Korea. Only in this way can they demonstrate their sincerity for peace to their own people and to all peace-loving people around the world. Otherwise, they cannot escape the responsibility of covering up the U.S.'s behavior of delaying the withdrawal of troops.

The Chinese People's Volunteers' initiative to withdraw from Korea is a peaceful initiative that has already produced and will continue to produce far-reaching effects. This is by no means something that the rulers in Washington can stop. People clearly see that this action not only demonstrates the infinite sincerity of the Chinese and Korean people for peace, but also represents the firm confidence of the two peoples in safeguarding the cause of peace. Whether or not someone has sincerity for peace cannot be determined by subjective exaggeration and lip service to peace. The standard by which people all over the world examine a government's sincerity for peace is action, not empty talk.

It has been almost five years since the Korean armistice, but Korea has not yet been peacefully unified. For five years, both sides' positions and views on the issue of peaceful reunification have been made very clear. There is no point in repeating these views now. In order to break the deadlock, the Chinese People's Volunteers have decided and are in the process of withdrawing completely from Korea in batches. If the U.S. has the slightest concern for the Korean people's desire to unify their homeland and for the Asian people's desire to ease tensions, it should follow the example of the Chinese People's Volunteers and immediately withdraw its troops from Korea. Only when all foreign troops are withdrawn from Korea can conditions be provided for a peaceful resolution of the Korean issue, including the issue of free elections. Otherwise, the U.S. will find it difficult to escape its responsibility for continuing to divide Korea and exacerbate tensions in the Far East.

    联合国军方面的“答复”
    本报评论员
    对于朝、中两国政府于2月5日、2月7日所倡议的并且为中国人民志愿军以实际行动所响应的朝鲜交战双方各将外国军队撤出朝鲜以便为和平解决朝鲜问题创造有利条件的重大建议，联合国军方面各国政府在华盛顿几经“磋商”之后，才迟迟于4月9日向朝、中两国政府提出了“答复”。
    美国政府和联合国军方面其他各国政府的这一“答复”在文字上极尽迂回曲折之能事，而在实质上是企图借口要求澄清关于自由选举的问题蒙混过关，逃避它们无可逃避的将美国和其他一些国家的军队撤出朝鲜的责任。
    这个照会对中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜的重大和平行动表示了一下“欢迎”，而对美国和其他国家军队从朝鲜撤退的问题却避开不谈。但是问题不是“欢迎”一下就能够解决的。也不是扯一下自由选举的问题就能推开的。现在全世界都在等着美国政府回答：美军到底撤不撤出，在什么时候撤出朝鲜？如果美国政府不想证明自己是自始至终阻挠朝鲜和平统一、强占南朝鲜和在朝鲜制造紧张局势的人，那么它就应该立刻采取和朝、中方面同样的措施，在最短期限内将美军全部撤出朝鲜。到现在为止还有军队留在朝鲜的其他国家除了有责任立即将自己的军队撤出朝鲜以外，也应该劝告美国政府立即采取措施将美军撤出朝鲜。只有这样，它们才能向本国人民和全世界爱好和平的人民表明它们的和平诚意。否则，它们也不能逃避替美国的拖延撤军的行为打掩护的责任。
    中国人民志愿军主动撤出朝鲜的和平创举已经产生了并且还将继续产生深远的影响。这绝不是华盛顿的执政者们的态度能够阻止的。人们清楚地看到这一行动不但表现了中、朝两国人民对和平的无限诚意，也是两国人民对于维护和平事业的坚定信心的表示。究竟谁有和平诚意，谁没有和平诚意，这不是主观夸张和口谈和平所能决定的。全世界人民检验一个政府的和平诚意的标准是行动而不是空谈。
    朝鲜停战以来已经快五年了，但是朝鲜还没有和平统一。五年来，双方对于和平统一问题的立场和观点已经表明得很清楚。现在再去重复这些观点对于事情不会有任何帮助。为了打开僵局，中国人民志愿军已经决定并且正在分批地全部撤出朝鲜。如果美国对于朝鲜人民统一祖国的愿望，对于亚洲人民和缓紧张局势的愿望有丝毫关心的话，它应该仿效中国人民志愿军的榜样，立即从朝鲜撤出它的军队。只有一切外国军队全部撤出朝鲜，才能为和平解决朝鲜问题包括自由选举问题提供条件。否则，美国将难以逃避它继续分裂朝鲜和加剧远东紧张局势的责任。
