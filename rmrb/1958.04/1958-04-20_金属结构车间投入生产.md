Xinhua News Agency, Baotou, 19th - The metal structure workshop of the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex's mechanical repair system was completed and put into production on the 18th, a month ahead of schedule. This is the first workshop in the Baogang plant area to be put into production.

This workshop can process 8,000 tons of metal structural parts such as steel plates and section steel annually. Its early commissioning is of great significance to ensuring the construction of Baogang's No. 1 blast furnace. This year, it will manufacture 550 tons of steel structural parts for the main projects such as blast furnaces and coke ovens. A large part of the metal structural parts for other projects will also be manufactured by this workshop.

At noon on the 18th, the workshop held a commencement ceremony. When the colored silk was cut, the cranes in the workshop immediately started running, the powerful plate rolling machine also roared into action, the welding machines emitted sparks, and the workers in new work clothes enthusiastically began the first day of work after the start of production.

The Baogang mechanical repair system has a total of ten workshops, and the metal structure workshop is one of them. Construction began in July last year.

    金属结构车间投入生产
    新华社包头19日电　包头钢铁联合企业机械修理系统的金属结构车间，已经提前一个月在18日建成投入生产。这是包钢厂区第一个投入生产的车间。
    这个车间每年能加工钢板、型钢等金属结构部件八千多吨。它的提前投入生产，对保证包钢第一号高炉的建设有重要意义。它今年就要为高炉、焦炉等主体工程制造五百五十多吨钢结构部件。其他工程的金属结构部件，也有很大一部分由这个车间制造。
    18日中午，这个车间举行了开工生产典礼。当彩绸剪断时，车间里的吊车立刻运行起来，强大的卷板机也轰轰开动，电焊机发出火花，穿着新工作服的工人们兴致勃勃地开始了开工生产后的第一天工作。
    包钢机修系统共有十个车间，金属结构车间是其中的一个。它是去年7月动工建设的。
