Centered on Four Comparisons and Two Oppositions, A New Upsurge is Unveiled
Hebei's Rural Rectification Promotes a Double Leap Forward

    (By this newspaper) The rural rectification and commune rectification movement in Hebei Province, with a new rectification upsurge centered on four comparisons and two oppositions, is taking shape.

    Of the more than 40,000 agricultural cooperatives in Hebei Province, more than half have completed rectification; of the remaining cooperatives, most are undergoing comprehensive rectification, with the exception of a few that have not yet undergone systematic rectification. It is expected that all will be completed by the end of May.

    The achievements of the rural rectification in Hebei Province are enormous, and the most prominent experience is the rectification method of Sanhe County. This county has a total of 387 villages. At the beginning of the rectification, the work progressed very slowly. The first batch of communes was rectified starting in September of last year, and it took three and a half months to complete twenty villages (cooperatives). Later, based on the instructions of the provincial party committee, the county party committee summarized the experience and lessons of this period and adopted a new, bold, and combined point-and-area method adapted to the leap forward situation. From February to mid-March this year, the remaining 367 communes were all rectified, achieving the requirements of more, faster, better, and more economical.

    The basic experience of Sanhe County is: (1) The county party committee personally went to the front line to provide specific assistance and guidance, and all departments worked together as one, cooperating in the battle. (2) Centralized training of cadres to cultivate backbones for rectification and commune rectification. (3) Strengthen key points, lead the overall situation with points. (4) The steps of township and commune rectification are flexibly grasped, focusing on rectification. "Cadres change quickly, and the masses are happy to work." Promote the letting off steam and debates through rectification. (5) After the rectification, organize collective acceptance. This not only ensured the quality of work but also spread the experience.

    After summarizing the previous stage of work, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee Rectification Conference believed that further developing the rectification movement centered on comparing energy, comparing advanced, comparing diligence and thrift, comparing more, faster, better, and more economical, and opposing conservatism and opposing waste, is an important key to deepening rural rectification, promoting the production upsurge, and striving for a great leap forward in agricultural production.

    The conference determined to focus on grasping the following key links: (1) Launch a debate centered on changing the face of the country with three years of hard work and striving for a great leap forward in agriculture in 1958. Criticize various conservative ideas, promote revolutionary vigor, and truly establish the idea of a leap forward and the idea of continuous revolution. (2) On the basis of major rectification and major reform, carry out a socialist education on how to treat the collective, how to treat collective labor, and how to treat public property, and solve the relationship between collective and individual, consumption and accumulation, and so on. (3) Continue to criticize the capitalist ideology represented by the well-to-do middle peasants.

    In view of the increasing busyness of spring plowing and production and the still arduous task of rectification and commune rectification, the Hebei Provincial Party Committee required all counties to promote the experience of Sanhe County. We must carry out the rectification to the end, we must link production and rectification together, and continue to launch a new upsurge of double leap forward in thought and production.

### 以四比、双反为中心掀起新高潮  河北农村整风推动双跃进

    以四比、双反为中心掀起新高潮
    河北农村整风推动双跃进
    本报讯　河北省农村整风、整社运动，以四比、双反为中心的新的整改高潮正在形成。
    河北全省四万多个农业社中，有半数以上已经整顿结束；其余的社，除少数尚未进行系统整改外，大部都在全面进行整顿。预计5月底可以全部结束。
    河北省农村整风的成绩是巨大的，其中最突出的经验是三河县的整风方法。这个县共三百八十七个村，整风开始时工作进展很慢。从去年9月开始第一批整社，二十个村（社）历时三个半月才结束。以后县委根据省委的指示，总结了这一段的经验教训，采取了适应跃进形势的新的大刀阔斧、点面结合的方法，从今年2月开始到3月中将其余的三百六十七个社全部整顿完毕，达到了多、快、好、省的要求。
    三河县的基本经验是：（一）县委亲临第一线，具体帮助指导，各个部门拧成一股绳，分工配合作战。（二）集中训练干部，培养整风整社的骨干。（三）加强重点，以点带面，推动全局。（四）乡、社整风的步骤灵活掌握，着重抓整改。“干部改的快，群众干的欢”，通过整改推动鸣放辩论。（五）整顿之后，组织集体验收。既保证了工作质量，又传播了经验。
    河北省委整风会议总结了前一段工作之后，认为进一步开展比干劲、比先进、比勤俭，比多、快、好、省，反保守、反浪费为中心的整改运动，是深入农村整风，推动生产高潮，争取农业生产大跃进的重要关键。
    会议确定着重抓紧下列几个主要环节：（一）以苦战三年改变面貌，争取1958年农业大跃进为中心，展开辩论。批判各种保守思想，发扬革命干劲，切实树立跃进的思想和不断革命的思想。（二）在大整大改的基础上，开展一个如何对待集体、如何对待集体劳动、如何对待公共财产的社会主义教育，解决集体与个人，消费和积累的关系等等。（三）继续批判以富裕中农为代表的资本主义思想。
    鉴于春耕生产日益繁忙，整风整社任务仍很艰巨，河北省委要求各县推广三河县的经验。一定把整风进行到底，一定要把生产、整风扭在一起，继续掀起一个思想、生产双跃进的新高潮。
