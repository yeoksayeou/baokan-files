Xinhua News Agency, April 4th Dispatch from London: In the increasingly shrinking capitalist world market, the struggle of mutual exclusion is intensifying. Britain's second-place position in the total export volume of manufactured goods in the capitalist world market was seized by West Germany in the second half of last year.

According to a report in the London "Financial Times" on March 28th, Britain's share of total manufactured goods exports in the capitalist world market continued to decline in the second half of 1957, falling from 18.3% in the first half of 1957 to 17.8%, while West Germany's share of manufactured goods exports rose from 16.7% to 18.4% during the same period. This is the first time West Germany has surpassed Britain in this regard since World War II.

In the second half of 1957, the United States' share of manufactured goods exports in the capitalist world market also fell from 26.2% in the first half of the year to 24.5%.

The "Financial Times" published a graph showing that the share of British manufactured goods exports in the capitalist world market has been declining year by year: 21.2% in 1953, 20.4% in 1954, 19.7% in 1955, and 19.1% in 1956. On the other hand, the percentage of West German manufactured goods exports in the same market has been rising year by year since 1953, from 13.2%.

In 1951, West Germany's share of manufactured goods exports in the capitalist world market (10%) was less than half of Britain's (22%).

    资本主义世界市场竞争剧烈
    西德制成品出口超过英国
    据新华社4日电　伦敦消息：在日益狭小的资本主义世界市场上，互相排挤的斗争正在加剧。英国在资本主义世界制成品出口总额中的第二把交椅已经在去年下半年被西德夺去。
    据伦敦“金融时报”3月28日报道，在1957年下半年资本主义世界制成品出口总额中，英国出口的制成品所占的份额继续下降，从1957年上半年的18.3％下降到17.8％，而同一时期西德出口的制成品所占的份额却从16.7％上升到18.4％。这是第二次世界大战后西德在这方面第一次超过了英国。
    1957年下半年美国出口的制成品在资本主义世界市场上所占份额也从上半年的26.2％降到24.5％。
    “金融时报”刊载了一幅图表表明，英国制成品的出口在资本主义世界市场上所占份额逐年在下降：1953年是21.2％，1954年是20.4％，1955年是19.7％，1956年是19.1％。而西德出口的制成品在同一市场上所占的百分比却从1953年的13.2％逐年上升。
    在1951年，西德出口的制成品在资本主义世界市场上所占份额（10％）还不到英国（22％）的一半。
