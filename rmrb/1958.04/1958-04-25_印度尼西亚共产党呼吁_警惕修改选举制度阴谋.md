    Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 24th: The Election Preparation Committee of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Indonesia issued a statement today, calling on all people, democrats, and progressive groups to be vigilant against the sabotage activities of reactionaries and to vigorously oppose their conspiracy to change the current election system into an undemocratic one.
    The second general election in Indonesia is scheduled to be held in September 1959.
    The statement said that when the rebels are nearing extinction, the reactionaries' attempt to revise the election system only shows that they are preparing to cope with the situation after their reactionary military actions have failed.
    The statement pointed out that the Indonesian Socialist Party is attempting to revise the election system in order to amend the election law passed in 1953, and also to invalidate the election date and general election preparations decided by the Juanda Cabinet and the Indonesian National Election Commission, thereby postponing the second parliamentary election.

    印度尼西亚共产党呼吁
    警惕修改选举制度阴谋
    新华社雅加达24日电　印度尼西亚共产党中央委员会大选筹备委员会今天发表声明，呼吁全体人民、民主人士和进步集团，警惕反动分子的破坏活动，大力反对他们企图把目前的选举制度改变成为不民主的制度的阴谋。
    印度尼西亚第二次大选预定在1959年9月举行。
    声明说，当叛乱分子接近灭亡的时候，反动分子企图修改选举制度，这只是表明，他们在采取反动的军事行动遭到失败之后，已经作应付局势的准备。
    声明指出，印度尼西亚社会党正企图修改选举制度，这是为了修改1953年通过的选举法，也是为了要使朱安达内阁和印度尼西亚政府全国选举委员会所决定的选举日期和大选准备工作归于无效，从而推迟第二次国会选举。
