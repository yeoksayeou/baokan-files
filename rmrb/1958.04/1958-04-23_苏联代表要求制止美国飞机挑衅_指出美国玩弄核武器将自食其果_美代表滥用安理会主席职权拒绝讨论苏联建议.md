Xinhua News Agency, New York, April 22nd: The United Nations Security Council held a meeting on the afternoon of the 21st at the request of the Soviet Union to discuss the issue of taking urgent measures to stop American military aircraft carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs from flying towards the Soviet border.

    Soviet Representative Sobolev spoke first at the meeting. He sternly condemned this provocative act by the United States that endangers world peace and submitted a proposal. The proposal stated that the Security Council believes that these flights exacerbate international tensions and pose a threat to the security of all peoples, and if continued, would lead to the destruction of world peace and the outbreak of a devastating atomic war. The proposal also stipulated that the Security Council demand that the United States cease the flight of military aircraft carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs towards the borders of other countries.

    Sobolev pointed out that these actions by the United States are a direct provocation against the cause of world peace. Due to American provocations or irresponsible actions, disaster may befall the world in the blink of an eye, and people may not even dream of the danger they face. We firmly believe that if the United Nations organization, which is mandated to maintain international peace and security, does not take the necessary measures to eliminate the danger posed by American bombers carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs attempting to approach the Soviet border with aggressive intentions, then it has not fulfilled its responsibilities.

    Sobolev said that the flights of American bombers subject the British, French, West German residents, and the people of countries bound by countless American military obligations and allowing the United States to build atomic and missile bases within their borders to a serious threat of atomic war. Their situation is further aggravated by the fact that American military aircraft carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs fly over these countries day and night.

    Sobolev pointed out that if there are still people in the United States who hope that the North American continent can avoid atomic warfare deaths in a war, this is nothing more than a fantasy. Now, one cannot help but see what consequences playing with atomic and hydrogen bombs will bring to the United States itself and millions upon millions of Americans.

    Sobolev pointed out that these actions by the United States are not accidental but are a manifestation of a completely definite policy. The United States and its NATO allies are increasingly subordinating their foreign policy and domestic life to one goal: preparing for atomic war. The culmination of all these war preparations is that American bombers are even risking flying towards the Soviet border carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs.

    The Soviet representative emphasized that it cannot be ignored that all these dangerous measures are being taken precisely at a time when preparations are being made to hold a summit meeting to ease international tensions and reduce the threat of a new war. In order to truly promote the improvement of the international situation and establish necessary international trust, the Soviet Union has substantially reduced its armed forces and decided to unilaterally cease testing nuclear weapons. However, the United States responded to these goodwill actions of the Soviet Union with the provocative actions of its military aircraft.

    Sobolev stated that the Soviet government firmly protests the above-mentioned actions of the U.S. Air Force and demands that the United States immediately cease these actions.

    Sobolev pointed out that last December, the 12th session of the United Nations General Assembly unanimously adopted a resolution on the peaceful coexistence of states. The General Assembly expressed the common will of the peoples of all countries, pointing out that it is necessary to ease international tensions and calling on UN member states to make efforts to strengthen international peace, develop friendly relations and cooperation. At that time, the American delegation also voted in favor of this resolution. However, the American action of dispatching aircraft carrying nuclear weapons to fly towards the Soviet border cannot be considered compatible with the obligations that countries should assume under the aforementioned resolution.

    Sobolev finally expressed the hope that the Security Council, which under the United Nations Charter bears the primary responsibility for maintaining international peace, can adopt an attitude on this issue that is in line with the highest principles and purposes of the United Nations.

    After Sobolev spoke, U.S. Representative Lodge spoke next. Lodge insisted that the Soviet Union's complaint to the Security Council was groundless. He confirmed that American military aircraft carrying nuclear weapons had flown towards the Soviet border. Lodge shamelessly said that such flights would continue in the future. Lodge said something about “prudent control” over the flight of American military aircraft, attempting to eliminate the great shock caused by the provocative flight of American bombers around the world.

    Canadian Representative Ritchie defended the flights of American aircraft in his speech. The representatives of France and Britain in their speeches only repeated what Lodge and the Canadian representative had said.

    Japanese Representative Yuzo Matsudaira expressed his unease about the deployment of bombers carrying atomic and hydrogen bombs during peacetime. He called on both sides to resume disarmament negotiations. However, he called for the resumption of the work of the United Nations Disarmament Committee, which the Western countries are desperately trying to convene in order to divert people's attention from the necessity of holding high-level negotiations.

    Iraqi representative insisted that discussing the issue of American aircraft's provocative actions would harm high-level negotiations. Representatives from Colombia and Panama supported Lodge's position.

    Soviet Representative Sobolev suggested holding the next meeting on April 22 to further discuss this issue. However, U.S. Representative Lodge, using his authority as President of the Security Council, violated the procedural rules and practices of the Security Council, and with the support of representatives from Panama, Britain, Canada, Colombia, and France, forcibly made the meeting reject Sobolev's suggestion.

    Sobolev then issued a statement saying: Under the initiative of the American representative, the Security Council has adopted an unprecedented procedure to discuss the important issue raised by the Soviet Union regarding maintaining peace and eliminating the threat of war. Due to the American representative's use of the voting machine and adoption of this procedure, it is not possible to conduct an organized and effective discussion of this important issue. The Soviet delegation is deeply convinced that it is absolutely necessary to pass the Soviet proposal, but in order to express its protest, it has decided to withdraw its proposal.

    The Security Council meeting then ended. In this way, the United States and the representatives of countries that follow American policy prevented the Security Council from adopting measures to stop the provocative actions of the U.S. Air Force that seriously threaten peace and security. However, the position taken by the United States in the Security Council exposed the true intentions of the United States to the world, demonstrating that the United States is not seeking to ease but to exacerbate international tensions and intends to continue provocative activities in the future.

    苏联代表要求制止美国飞机挑衅
    指出美国玩弄核武器将自食其果
    美代表滥用安理会主席职权拒绝讨论苏联建议
    新华社22日讯  据塔斯社纽约讯：联合国安全理事会应苏联的请求21日下午举行会议，讨论关于采取紧急措施来制止载有原子弹和氢弹的美国军事飞机向苏联边境飞行的问题。
    苏联代表索波列夫在会上首先发言。他严厉谴责美国这种危害世界和平的挑衅行为，并且提出一项提案。提案说，安全理事会认为这种飞行使国际紧张局势加剧，造成对于各国人民安全的威胁，如果继续下去就会导致破坏全世界和平和爆发毁灭性的原子战争。提案并规定，安全理事会要求美国制止载有原子弹和氢弹的军用飞机向他国边境飞行。
    索波列夫指出，美国这种行动是对世界和平事业的直接挑衅，由于美国的挑衅或者不负责任的行动，有可能转眼之间在世界上降临灾难，而人民甚至做梦也没有想到他们面临着怎样的危险。我们坚信，受命维护国际和平与安全的联合国组织假如不采取必要的措施，去消除载有原子弹和氢弹的美国轰炸机抱着侵略目的企图接近苏联边境所引起的危险，那么，它就没有完成它的职责。
    索波列夫说，美国轰炸机的飞行使英国人、法国人、西德居民以及受到美国无数军事义务约束并且让美国在本国境内建筑原子基地与导弹基地的国家的人民遭到严重的原子战争的威胁。由于载有原子弹和氢弹的美国军用飞机昼夜不停地在这些国家的上空飞行，它们的处境的危险就更加深了。
    索波列夫指出，如果美国还有人指望，在战争中北美洲大陆能够避免原子战争死亡，这只不过是一种幻想。现在不能不看到，玩弄原子弹和氢弹会给美国本身和千千万万的美国人带来什么样的后果。
    索波列夫指出，美国这种行动不是偶然的事情，而是一种完全肯定的政策的表现。美国和它的北大西洋集团的盟国正日益使本国的外交政策和国内生活服从于一个目的：准备原子战争。而这一切备战活动的顶点，就是美国轰炸机竟然甘冒风险地载着原子弹和氢弹飞向苏联国境。
    苏联代表着重指出，不能忽视的是：采取所有这些危险措施正是在准备举行最高级会议以缓和国际紧张局势、减少新战争威胁的时候。苏联为了想真正促进改善国际局势，树立必要的国际信任，大量地裁减了武装部队，决定单方面停止试验核武器，但是美国却用自己的军用飞机的挑衅行为来回答苏联这些善意的行动。
    索波列夫表示，苏联政府坚决抗议美国空军的上述行动，并且要求美国立即停止这种行动。
    索波列夫指出，去年12月，联合国大会第十二届会议一致通过了一项各国和平共处的决议。大会表达了各国人民共同的意志，指出必须缓和国际紧张局势，并呼吁联合国会员国尽力加强国际和平，发展友好关系和合作。当时美国代表团也是投票赞成这个决议的。然而，美国派遣带有核武器的飞机朝苏联国境飞行的这种行动决不能认为是能够同各国根据上述决议所应承担的义务相容的。
    索波列夫最后表示希望，根据联合国宪章承担了维护国际和平主要责任的安全理事会能够在这一问题上采取符合联合国最高原则和宗旨的态度。
    在索波列夫发言以后，美国代表洛奇接着发言。洛奇硬说，苏联向安全理事会提出控诉是没有理由的。他证实了载有核武器的美国军用飞机曾经向苏联边境飞行。洛奇无耻地说，今后还要继续这种飞行。洛奇说什么对于美国军用飞机的飞行有“谨慎的控制”，企图用这来消除美国轰炸机挑衅性飞行在全世界引起的很大的震惊。
    加拿大代表里奇在发言中为美国飞机的飞行辩护。法国和英国的代表在发言中只是重复了洛奇和加拿大代表说过的东西。
    日本代表松平勇雄对于载有原子弹和氢弹的轰炸机在和平时期出动表示不安。他要求双方恢复裁军谈判。但是他却要求恢复联合国裁军委员会的工作，而这是西方国家为了转移人们对于举行高级谈判的必要性的注意力才极力要求召开的。
  伊拉克代表硬说，讨论美国飞机的挑衅行动问题会损害高级谈判。哥伦比亚和巴拿马的代表支持洛奇的立场。
    苏联代表索波列夫建议在4月22日召开下一次会议，进一步讨论这个问题。但是，美国代表洛奇利用他安全理事会主席的职权，违反了安全理事会的程序规则和惯例，在巴拿马、英国、加拿大、哥伦比亚和法国的代表的支持下，强使会议拒绝了索波列夫的这一建议。
    索波列夫接着发表声明说：安全理事会在美国代表的倡议下，采取了前所未闻的、没有先例的程序来讨论苏联提出的有关维持和平和消除战争威胁的重要问题。由于美国代表运用了表决机器，采取这种程序，对这一重要问题不能进行有组织的切实的讨论。苏联代表团深信十分必要通过苏联的提案，但是为了表示抗议，决定撤回自己的提案。
    安全理事会会议至此结束。这样，美国和追随美国政策的各国代表阻止了安全理事会通过措施以制止美国空军严重威胁和平和安全的挑衅行动。然而美国在安全理事会所采取的立场，在全世界面前暴露了美国的真正目的，表明了美国不是力求缓和而是力求加剧国际紧张局势，并且打算今后继续进行挑衅活动。
