    Paper Mulberry Bark
    There are two types of paper mulberry: large paper mulberry and small paper mulberry. Farmers call the large paper mulberry "domesticated mulberry" and the small paper mulberry "wild mulberry" because large paper mulberry trees often grow in front of and behind houses, while small paper mulberry trees grow on mountains. The large paper mulberry tree is several yards tall, about the thickness of a teacup, and the largest can be more than a foot in diameter. The leaves do not fork and are pointedly oval. In early summer, it bears spherical fruit, which falls off after ripening and cannot be eaten. The small paper mulberry tree is generally about the thickness of a thumb and several feet tall. The leaves fork and are shaped like loofah leaves. To peel the bark of the large paper mulberry, use the branch-removing peeling method to avoid affecting the growth in subsequent years. Harvesting time is best in summer and autumn. The bark of the small paper mulberry should be harvested in autumn, and it can sprout and grow again the following year. According to the Chongqing Municipal Industrial Bureau's experimental institute, it can be used to make rope, paper, and after chemical treatment, it can be used as cotton wool or blended with raw cotton.

    构树皮
    构树分大构树与小构树两种。农民称大构为家构，小构为野构，因大构树多生长于屋檐前后，小构多生长在山上。大构树高约数丈，粗如茶杯，最大的直径可达一尺以上，叶不发叉、呈尖椭圆形，夏初结球形果实，成熟后即落掉，不能食。小构树一般约大姆指粗，高约数尺，叶子发叉，形状像丝瓜叶子。剥制大构皮用剔枝剥皮法，以免影响历年生长。采摘时间以夏秋两季为宜。小构皮宜秋天采割，第二年又可发芽生长。其用途据重庆市工业局实验所化验，可制绳、造纸，经过化学处理，可作棉絮或与原棉混纺。
