    Water Paddy Field Disc Tooth Roller Harrow Dual-Purpose Implement
    (Reported by this newspaper) Tang Dongxing, a carpenter from the He’xin Second Branch of the He’xing Township in Changsha County, Hunan Province, successfully trial-produced a "Water Paddy Field Disc Tooth Roller Harrow Dual-Purpose Implement". After summarizing by the trial producer and visiting farmers, it has five major advantages: (1) The mud is well-broken and of good quality. It can completely replace the old-fashioned foot-operated harrow and the old-fashioned bundled roller. After harrowing, no mud clods can be found. Originally, the commune members had a common concern, that the mud clods would not be broken up, making close planting difficult. However, the fields harrowed with the "Water Paddy Field Disc Tooth Roller Harrow Dual-Purpose Implement" can completely solve this difficulty, which is of great benefit to close planting. (2) High work efficiency and labor saving. The old-fashioned foot-operated harrow can only harrow ten mu per day with a strong ox, while the "Water Paddy Field Disc Tooth Roller Harrow Dual-Purpose Implement" can harrow sixteen mu per day with a first-class ox. With the mud clods broken up, it is estimated that 30% of labor can be saved during rice transplanting. At the same time, weeds can be reduced or not grow at all, saving 25% of labor for inter-row cultivation and weeding. (3) Low cost, less manufacturing work, and easy to make. Manufacturing the "Disc Tooth Roller Harrow Dual-Purpose Implement" only requires four carpenters, all made of wood, without needing even an ounce of iron, with each unit costing only 2.5 yuan. (4) Lightweight and agile, the whole body weighs only about thirty pounds, making it easy to turn and move during rolling and harrowing. (5) Safe to use. When harrowing with the old-fashioned iron harrow, people and cattle could accidentally have their feet cut by the harrow teeth. With the disc tooth roller harrow dual-purpose implement, this phenomenon can be completely eliminated.

    水田圆盘齿滚耙两用器
    本报讯　湖南长沙县合兴乡合心二分社木工唐冬兴试制一种“水田圆盘齿滚耙两用器”成功，经过试制人和参观的农民总结，有五大好处：（1）烂泥好、质量好，它完全可以代替老式踩耙和老式扎滚，耙后再也找不到泥块了。原来社员群众有一个共同的顾虑，就是怕泥块耙不烂，密植有困难。但用“水田圆盘齿滚耙两用器”所耙的田，就完全可以解决这一困难。对密植有很大的好处。（2）工效高，省工多，老式的踩耙耙田，一等壮牛每天只能耙十亩，而“水田圆盘齿滚耙两用器”，每天一等牛能耙十六亩。泥块耙碎了，插秧时估计能省工30％，同时，可以少长或不长杂草，可节约25％的中耕除草用工。（3）成本低，制工少，容易做。制造“圆盘齿滚耙两用器”，每个只花四个木工，全部用木制，不需要一两铁，每部价仅二点五元。（4）轻便灵巧，全身体重只有三十斤左右，滚耙时转弯和搬动方便。（5）使用安全。用老式铁耙耙田时，人牛不小心就会被耙齿划破脚，用圆盘齿滚耙两用器，就可以完全消除这一现象。
