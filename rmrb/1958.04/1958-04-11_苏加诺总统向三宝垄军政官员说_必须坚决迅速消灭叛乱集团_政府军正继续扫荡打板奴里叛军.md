Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 9th: President Sukarno revealed last night that someone is plotting to establish a new Islamic group including Sumatra, Indonesia. He also pointed out that the rebellion in West Sumatra must be resolved immediately, otherwise Indonesia will be annexed by a certain party, and all or part of Indonesia will be drawn into a certain group.

Sukarno made these remarks to local military and political officials in Semarang.

The President said that the adventurers in Padang-Bukittinggi betrayed Indonesia's independent policy and openly planned to join a certain group. Sukarno said that the action against the Padang rebellion must not slow down and must be resolved resolutely and quickly. The President said that if the rebellion is not suppressed immediately, the activities of dropping weapons and smuggling weapons will continue.

President Sukarno said that when he was traveling abroad, he received news everywhere that some elements were dissatisfied with Indonesia's failure to form an alliance with a certain group. Some elements are plotting to drag those countries that implement independent policies into their group. The President said that the plot of these elements to establish an "Arab group to join a certain group" has failed, so they are now plotting to establish a new Islamic group composed of Pakistan, Malaya, Sumatra of Indonesia, British Borneo, and southern Philippines. The President said that when he was abroad, someone had reminded him to pay attention to the attempts of these elements.

The President reiterated that Indonesia pursues an independent foreign policy and does not participate in any group. He once again criticized the conspiracy to drag Indonesia into a certain group.

Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 10th: According to a broadcast from Medan Radio on the evening of the 9th, Brigadier General Jatikusumo, the representative of the Chief of Staff of the Indonesian Army, said in Medan that the government forces are continuing to sweep up the rebels in Padang, where the rebels are now in desperate situation.

The rebels who fled to Padang are already under a strong pincer offensive by government forces.

According to military sources, 123 members of the 131st Battalion of the Padang rebels have surrendered to the 3rd Regiment of the local garrison in Darudong, northeast of Sibolga. The 3rd Regiment disarmed them and sent them to their original garrison in East Sumatra. These surrendered soldiers joined the rebel group after the Medan Incident.

At the same time, the government forces continued to sweep up the rebels who had fled to areas near the Aceh border. On April 7, the government had recovered the two small towns of Seran Jaya and Limau Mongkur.

After the failure of the rebellion launched by Nainggolan in Medan, they fled in two directions, north and south, towards Padang and Aceh. Most of them were annihilated or surrendered to government forces on the way.

    苏加诺总统向三宝垄军政官员说
    必须坚决迅速消灭叛乱集团
    政府军正继续扫荡打板奴里叛军
    据新华社雅加达9日电　苏加诺总统昨天晚上透露，有人正在阴谋建立一个包括印度尼西亚的苏门答腊在内的新伊斯兰集团。他还指出，西苏门答腊的叛乱必须立即解决，否则印度尼西亚将为某个方面所并吞，而且印度尼西亚的全部或一部分将被拉入某一个集团。
    苏加诺这一番话是在三宝垄对当地军政官员说的。
    总统说，巴东—武吉丁宜的冒险分子背叛了印度尼西亚的独立政策，公开策划参加某一集团。苏加诺说，对付巴东叛乱的行动决不能缓慢下来，必须坚决而迅速地加以解决。总统说，要是叛乱不立即镇压下去，空投武器和偷运武器的活动将会继续进行。
    苏加诺总统说，当他在国外旅行的时候，他到处都得到消息，说某些分子不满印度尼西亚同某一集团不结成联盟。某些分子阴谋把那些执行独立政策的国家拉入他们的集团。总统说，这些分子想建立“阿拉伯集团以参加某一集团”的阴谋已经失败，因此他们现在阴谋建立由巴基斯坦、马来亚、印度尼西亚的苏门答腊、英属婆罗洲和菲律宾南部组成的新伊斯兰集团。总统说，当他在国外的时候，有人曾经提醒他注意这些分子的企图。
    总统重申，印度尼西亚奉行独立的外交政策，不参加任何集团。他再次批评想把印度尼西亚拉入某一集团的阴谋。
    新华社雅加达10日电　据棉兰电台9日晚间广播，印度尼西亚陆军参谋长的代表贾提库苏莫准将在棉兰说，政府军正在继续扫荡打板奴里的叛军，那里的叛军现在已经陷于绝境。
    逃窜到打板奴里的叛军已处在政府军的强有力的钳形攻势之下。
    据军方的消息说，打板奴里的叛军第一三一营已经有一百二十三人向实武牙东北打鲁栋的当地驻军第三团投降。第三团解除了他们的武装，并且把他们送到东苏门答腊的他们的原来驻地。这些投降的士兵是在棉兰事变后参加叛乱集团的。
    同时，政府军继续扫荡逃到亚齐边境附近地区的叛军。4月7日，政府已经收复了塞兰贾雅和利毛蒙库尔两个小城。
    奈恩戈兰率领的叛军在棉兰发动叛乱失败以后，分南北两路向打板奴里和亚齐方面逃窜。他们大部分在途中被歼灭或向政府军投降。
