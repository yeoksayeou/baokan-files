This newspaper's Baoding dispatch of the 22nd: The people of Hebei Province are once again going all out to fight the drought. They are determined to realize the heroic slogan of "Guaranteeing full seedlings even if it doesn't rain in spring, and ensuring a good harvest even if it doesn't rain all year!"

Except for a few areas such as Zhangjiakou and Chengde, Hebei Province has not had rain for more than two hundred days. Not only has it not rained this past winter and spring, but the rainfall during the rainy season last year was also less than in previous years, and the soil moisture content of arable land is very poor, resulting in a severe drought. Party and government leading organs at all levels throughout the province, in order to ensure good sowing even without rain and to guarantee a good harvest despite the drought, have adopted measures to mobilize the entire party and all the people to carry out the fight against drought. Each special district has established a drought resistance and sowing command headquarters to uniformly command the drought resistance army to fight in coordination. Nearly 10,000 cadres from the direct organs of the Handan Special District and local troops have been mobilized, carrying 50 cars, 150 horse-drawn carts, 38 water pumping machines, 39 water pumps, and nearly 2,000 other water lifting tools, and set off on the 16th to mountainous areas such as Wu'an and Shexian to fight the drought. In response to the complacency and paralysis of some cadres in Cangxian Special District who believe that water conservancy projects can basically solve the problem, the special district requires all counties to conduct a general survey of water shortage blind spots and eliminate them with a concentrated effort. The irrigation area of this special district has reached 73% of the total cultivated land of the entire special district, and it seems that there is no big problem in completing the current spring sowing task. In reality, some areas have both canal irrigation and well irrigation, while other areas have neither rivers to use nor sparse water wells. Some places do not even have a single well for hundreds or thousands of acres of land, or the well water is very scarce. After the Wuqiang County Party Committee of the Communist Party of China inspected and found that 50% of the total acres sown in spring still had no water source, it immediately decided to drill more than 3,000 wells, dig more than 19,000 water cellars, and dig more than 3,300 sections of canals to eliminate water conservancy blind spots.

Through the hard work of the people of the province, as of April 17, the province has sown 11 million mu of grain and cotton crops. Now all parts of the province are rushing to sow. On the 17th, Baoding Special District called on the people of the entire district to fight hard for 20 days, complete the sowing of cotton fields before the end of April, and complete the sowing of grain and oil crops on May 10. Many mountainous areas have universally promoted the method of moving water tanks to store water and transporting water for spot sowing due to water shortage. Tang County has moved more than 40,000 water tanks and dug more than 5,000 water cellars. Some water-deficient areas also use pack animals to transport water for sowing from more than ten miles away.

According to surveys, groundwater resources are very abundant in various parts of Hebei Province. In conjunction with the drought resistance and sowing struggle, the province is prepared to expand the irrigation area by 20 million to 30 million mu. Hengshui County in Shijiazhuang Special District launched a 10,000-well campaign, and after two weeks of hard work, has basically realized the county's water conservancy. Quyang County mobilized 100,000 people to carry out a major assault, and after 25 days of battle, has expanded the irrigated area by 100,000 mu. It is planned to work for another ten days and nights to expand the irrigated area by 160,000 mu.

The most prominent feature in the drought resistance struggle in various places is that after the rural rectification movement, the communist ideological consciousness of the broad masses of commune members has been unprecedentedly improved, and mutual support has emerged between villages and villages, communes and communes, mountainous areas and plains, and areas with good water conservancy conditions and areas with poor water conservancy conditions. The masses in Baoding Special District put forward the slogan: "Thousands of communes are one family, all people are of one mind, tools and labor support each other, and we are in the same boat to strive for a good harvest." This special district organized a 20,000-person drought resistance expeditionary force from eight counties in the east and south with relatively less difficult sowing tasks to help with sowing in the mountainous areas. Yutian and other counties in Shijiazhuang Special District dispatched 25,000 people to support neighboring counties in drought resistance and sowing, while Helu and other eight counties transferred 18,000 waterwheels to support neighboring counties in drought resistance. Yuanjia Village, Quancun, and Yincun three townships in Yuanshi County, in order to support Beizhu Township in watering wheat, more than 2,000 people brought their own buckets, large jars, and lunch, and watered 800 mu of wheat in one day. Many places have achieved "If one team has difficulties, the entire commune supports it; if one commune has difficulties, the entire township supports it; if one township has difficulties, the entire county supports it; if one county has difficulties, the entire district supports it."

In the drought resistance struggle, all localities have attached great importance to wheat field management. The "Three Universal Movements" of universal watering, universal topdressing, and universal mid-tillage are being carried out, striving to harvest 8 billion catties of wheat, doubling the yield compared to last year. After a special debate, agricultural cooperatives in Wuqiao and other counties in Cangxian Special District reversed the idea of managing the strong but not the weak in wheat field management, and universally strengthened the management of the third category of wheat fields. Gaocheng adopted the method of watering early and watering frequently, and now more than 140,000 mu of wheat fields have been watered twice, and at the same time, they have universally deep-plowed (mid-tilled) twice. The first-class wheat seedlings in this county are very strong, and most of the second and third-class wheat seedlings have been upgraded.

    干旱本是坏事　但坏事能变好事
    河北全民抗旱加速水利建设
    万众一心寻找水源消灭水利空白点
    本报保定22日电　河北省人民再次鼓足干劲向干旱作斗争。他们决心实现“春不下雨保全苗，年不下雨保丰收”的英雄口号。
    河北省除张家口、承德等少数地区外，其他地区已有二百多天没有下雨，不仅去冬今春没有下雨，而且去年雨季降雨量也较往年少，耕地底墒很差，目前已形成严重旱象。全省各级党、政领导机关，为了保证无雨也要播好种，干旱也要保丰收，都采取了全党全民总动员的措施，进行抗旱斗争。各专区都建立了抗旱播种指挥部，统一指挥抗旱大军协同作战。邯郸专区直属机关干部和当地驻军已动员近万人，携带汽车五十辆、马车一百五十辆、抽水机器三十八部、水泵三十九个，还有其他提水工具近二千件，在16日开赴武安、涉县等山区进行抗旱。沧县专区针对某些干部认为水利工程基本上可以解决问题的自满情绪和麻痹思想，要求各县普查缺水空白点，予以突击消灭。这个专区的灌溉面积已达全专区总耕地73％，好像完成当前春播任务问题不大，实际上有些地区既有渠灌又有井浇，而另外一部分地区既没有河水可利用，水井也稀少，甚至有些地方百亩、千亩地一眼井也没有，或者井水很少。中共武强县委检查发现仍有占春播总亩数50％的地没有水源后，立即决定再打井三千多眼，挖水柜一万九千多个，挖渠道三千三百多段，消灭水利空白点。
    经过全省人民的苦战，到4月17日为止，全省已播种粮棉作物一千一百万亩。现在全省各地正在突击播种。保定专区17日向全区人民号召苦战二十天，在4月底前完成棉田播种，5月10日完成粮食、油料作物播种。很多山区因为缺水，都普遍推广了移缸蓄水运水点种的办法。唐县已移缸四万多口，打水窖五千多个。有些缺水地方，还用驮子到十多里以外运水播种。
    根据调查，河北省各地地下水源很丰富。在结合抗旱播种斗争中，全省准备扩大灌溉面积二千万至三千万亩。石家庄专区的衡水县开展万眼井运动，经两周苦战，已基本上实现全县水利化。曲阳县发动十万人大突击，经过二十五天战斗，已扩大浇地十万亩。计划再干十昼夜，扩大浇地十六万亩。
    在各地抗旱斗争中表现最突出的特点是：经过农村整风运动，广大社员的共产主义思想觉悟空前提高，出现了乡与乡、社与社、山区与平原、水利条件好与水利条件差的地区之间的互相支援。保定专区群众提出：“千社是一家，万众一条心，工具、劳力两支援，同舟共济争丰收”的口号。这个专区从东部、南部八个播种任务困难较小的县，组织二万人的抗旱远征军到山区去帮助播种。石家庄专区玉田等县，出动二万五千人去支援邻县抗旱播种，获鹿等八县抽调一万八千部水车支援邻县抗旱。元氏县院家村、泉村、因村三乡，为了支援北渚乡浇麦，二千多人自带水桶、大缸和午饭，一天浇麦八百亩。许多地方作到了“一队有困难，全社支援，一社有困难，全乡支援，一乡有困难，全县支援，一县有困难，全区支援”。
    在抗旱斗争中，各地对麦田管理都很重视。正在开展普遍浇水、普遍追肥、普遍中耕的“三普运动”，争取麦收拿到八十亿斤，比去年增产一倍。沧县专区吴桥等县农业社，经过专题辩论，扭转了麦田管理中管强不管弱的思想，普遍加强了对三类麦田的管理。藁城采取浇水早、浇水勤的办法，现在十四万多亩麦田浇了二水，同时普遍深划（中耕）了二次。这个县一类麦苗十分茁壮，二、三类麦苗多数已升级。
