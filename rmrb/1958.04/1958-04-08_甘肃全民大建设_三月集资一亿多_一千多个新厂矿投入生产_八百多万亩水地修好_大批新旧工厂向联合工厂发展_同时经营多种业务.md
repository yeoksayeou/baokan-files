    Over 1,000 New Factories and Mines Go Into Production; Over 8 Million Mu of Irrigated Land Completed
    Large Numbers of New and Old Factories Develop Into Combined Factories, Engaging in Multiple Operations Simultaneously

    (Our newspaper's Lanzhou dispatch, April 7th, by reporter Guo Fenxiang) Gansu Province is relying on mass fundraising to vigorously develop local industry and large-scale water conservancy projects, embodying the spirit of the entire people running industry and boosting water conservancy. In the past three months, the province's people have pledged to raise over 110 million yuan, nearly three times the state's total investment in Gansu's local industry and water conservancy construction this year. This is sufficient to construct the planned three thousand-plus small factories and mines, ten million mu of irrigated land, and the 900-li-long Yintao irrigation project this year.
    Currently, 1,015 newly built factories and mines in Gansu Province have already gone into production, and over 8 million mu of irrigated land have been completed.
    In the past, Gansu Province had a weak local industrial base and little irrigated land, so the masses urgently demanded a change in this backward situation. Therefore, the launch of mass fundraising immediately received a warm welcome from the broad masses. Some people dug out the gold and silver buried by their ancestors to exchange for investment. Others, in addition to providing cash, also offered wood and old ironware. Lanzhou City planned to raise 10 million yuan in two months, but in just over twenty days, they have already raised over 11 million yuan. Some old men even took out their burial clothes and coffins to invest at a discounted price. They believe that building socialism is building a happy life, which can prolong life, while burial clothes and coffins are not needed for the time being.
    When determining the fundraising amount, the local Party committees considered both ensuring the leap forward speed of industry and agriculture and the people's capabilities. In carrying out the fundraising movement, they all paid attention to conducting full publicity and mobilization work, educating the masses with the vivid facts of socialist construction. In addition, they also paid attention to taking care of the immediate interests of the masses. It is generally stipulated that the principal and interest of the people's investment will be repaid annually within five years, relying on the profits and accumulation of the invested factories and mines, using a lottery method.

    (Our newspaper's Lanzhou dispatch, April 7th, by reporter Guo Fenxiang) Gansu Province has decided to build over one hundred combined factories or comprehensive factories engaging in multiple operations this year. Many existing factories engaging in single operations are also gradually developing into new-type factories engaging in two, three, up to six or seven operations.
    The existing twenty oil pressing plants and wineries have decided to add a small amount of production equipment, without increasing manpower, and will be able to produce 100,000 tons of mixed feed for rural areas this year. Some factories such as power, textile, and flour mills will also add flax processing, feed processing, agricultural tool repair, and machinery manufacturing operations, becoming combined factories. The planned beet sugar factory plans to use beets to make sugar, use waste silk to make wine, and use the remaining distiller's grains to feed pigs and cattle. This year, every county in the province will build a comprehensive machinery manufacturing and repair plant. These plants will undertake three tasks: manufacturing and repairing small agricultural tools and irrigation and drainage machinery; manufacturing and repairing relatively simple industrial equipment; and manufacturing and repairing folk transportation tools. Some water mills in the vast rural areas of Huixian County have also been converted into small combined factories with multiple operations such as hydropower generation, flour milling, oil pressing, rice milling, and cotton ginning.
    Several years ago, Gansu Province built a batch of multi-operation factories such as the Xifeng Town Combined Factory, the Guyuan Oil-Electricity-Flour Mill, and the Wuzhong Electricity-Oil Mill. These factories only built one set of offices and welfare facilities. Compared with building several single production and operation factories separately, it can save investment, save management cadres, enable continuous production, and fully utilize equipment capacity and labor. The Xifeng Town Combined Factory used to operate five businesses: power generation, flour milling, oil pressing, sand casting, and machinery repair. Now, according to rural needs, it is further tapping the potential of personnel and equipment. It only needs to add some apprentices and some equipment to add five new businesses: processing millet, tobacco leaves, flax, manufacturing bone fertilizer, and using oil cake and millet bran to make mixed feed, becoming a versatile factory facing the countryside. What poor places can do, rich places can do even better.

    In just over three months, the people of Gansu Province raised over 110 million yuan, solving the funding for building more than 3,000 small factories and newly building 10 million mu of irrigated land this year. This example once again proves that as long as we rely on the masses, there is nothing we cannot do.
    Gansu Province only has 12 million people and is a relatively poor province. In the early days of liberation, the people still lived a life of "half a year of grain mixed with bran and wild vegetables." After the development of production in the past few years since liberation, the people have been able to recuperate and recuperate, and their lives have greatly improved. However, the family wealth of Gansu farmers is still thinner than that of other provinces. Now that this relatively poor province can collect so much funds from the masses, it is conceivable that other relatively wealthy provinces can collect even more funds.
    Let us all learn from the experience of Gansu and let the flowers of local industry bloom all over the country!

### 甘肃全民大建设　三月集资一亿多  一千多个新厂矿投入生产　八百多万亩水地修好  大批新旧工厂向联合工厂发展　同时经营多种业务

    甘肃全民大建设　三月集资一亿多
    一千多个新厂矿投入生产　八百多万亩水地修好
    大批新旧工厂向联合工厂发展　同时经营多种业务
    本报兰州7日电　记者郭汾祥报道：甘肃省依靠群众集资大办地方工业，大兴水利事业，体现了全民办工业兴水利的精神。三个多月来，全省群众报认集资已达一亿一千万元以上，几乎等于今年国家对甘肃地方工业和水利建设总投资的三倍，足够用来建设今年计划中的三千多个小型厂矿和一千万亩水地，以及九百里长的引洮灌溉工程。
    现在，甘肃省已经有一千零十五个新建厂矿投入生产，水地也已修好八百多万亩。
    甘肃省过去地方工业基础薄弱，水地不多，群众迫切要求改变这种落后面貌。所以展开群众性的集资马上受到广大群众的热烈欢迎。有的人把祖上埋在地下的黄金、白银挖出来，兑换后认购集资。有的人除拿出现金外，还拿出木料、旧铁器来。兰州市计划二个月集资一千万元，到现在只不过二十多天，就已经集资一千一百多万元。有些老汉把自己的寿衣、寿板也拿出来折价投资。他们认为建设社会主义就是建设幸福生活，可以延年益寿，而寿衣、寿板暂时还用不着。
    各地党委确定集资数额的时候，既考虑了保证工农业的跃进速度，又考虑到群众的能力。在开展集资运动中，都注意进行充分的宣传动员工作，用社会主义建设的生动事实教育群众。此外，还注意照顾群众的眼前利益。一般规定群众集资在五年内依靠所投资厂矿的盈余和积累，取采抽签方式，逐年还本付息。
    本报兰州7日电　记者郭汾祥报道：甘肃省决定今年新建一百个以上经营多种业务的联合工厂或综合工厂；旧有许多经营单一业务的工厂，也正在逐步发展为经营二、三种至六、七种业务的新型工厂。
    现有的二十个榨油厂和制酒厂已决定添置少许生产设备，不增加人力，今年就能为农村生产十万吨混合饲料。电力、纺织、面粉等一些工厂，也将增加亚麻加工、饲料加工、修农具和制造机械等业务，变成联合工厂。正在筹备中的甜菜制糖厂，计划利用甜菜制糖，利用废丝酿酒，剩下的酒糟自己喂猪、喂牛。今年全省每一个县都要兴建一个综合性的机械制造和修配厂，这些厂要担负起三个任务：制造和修理小型农具和排灌机械；制造和修理较简单的工业设备；制造和修理民间运输工具。徽县广大农村中的一些水磨，也已经改装成为水力发电、磨面、榨油、碾米、弹棉花等多种业务的小型联合厂。
    几年以前，甘肃省就兴建了西峰镇联合工厂、固原油电面厂、吴忠电油厂等一批多种经营的工厂，这些工厂只建设一套办公室和生活福利设施，比分散建设几个单一生产经营的工厂，既可节省投资，又能节省管理干部，能连续生产，充分发挥设备能力和劳动力。西峰镇联合工厂过去经营发电、磨面、榨油、翻砂、机械修配五种业务，现在正根据农村需要进一步挖掘人员、设备的潜力，只需增加一些徒工和一些设备，就可以再增加五种新业务：加工小米、烟叶、亚麻，制造骨肥，并利用油饼、小米糠做混合饲料，成为面向农村的万能工厂。穷地方能办到的富地方更能办到
    在短短的三个多月内，甘肃省群众集资达一亿一千多万元，解决了今年新建三千多个小工厂和新修一千万亩水地的资金。这个事例再一次证明：只要依靠群众，没有办不到的事情。
    甘肃省只有一千二百万人，又是一个比较穷困的省份。解放初期，人民仍然过着“糠菜半年粮”的生活。经过解放后这几年生产的发展，人民得到休养生息，生活已有很大改善。但是，甘肃农民的家底比起其他省份来还是很薄的。现在这个比较穷的省能够从群众中搜集起那么多资金，可以想见，其他比较富遮的省份，一定可以搜集到更多的资金。
    大家都来学习甘肃的经验吧，让地方工业的花朵开遍全国！
