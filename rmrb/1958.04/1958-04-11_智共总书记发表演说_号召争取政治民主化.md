Xinhua News Agency, Buenos Aires, 10th. TASS reported on the 9th: According to the "Informant" newspaper, the General Secretary of the Chilean Communist Party, Corbalan, stated in a speech in Valparaiso that the main task of progressive forces in the struggle to restore democratic freedoms in Chile is to enable the Communist Party to regain the right to legal existence. He said, this "is not only a concern for communists, but also for all the Chilean people… Persecuting communists is equivalent to persecuting our working class and our people."

Corbalan emphasized that the establishment of the nine-party parliamentary alliance is of great significance. The purpose of establishing this alliance is to fight for the democratization of Chilean political life. Participating in this alliance are the Popular Action Front (which includes five political parties, including the Communist Party), the Agrarian Labor Party, the National Party, the Christian Democratic Party, and the Radical Party.

Corbalan pointed out that the starting point for the participants in the alliance is first and foremost the supreme interests of the nation and "the necessity to make Chilean political life healthy," although the establishment of this alliance does not mean that serious differences of opinion between the parties have been eliminated.

    智共总书记发表演说
    号召争取政治民主化
    新华社10日讯  据塔斯社布宜诺斯艾利斯9日电：据“报信者”报报道，智利共产党总书记科尔巴兰在伐尔帕拉伊索城发表演说时说，进步力量在争取恢复智利民主自由的斗争中的主要任务是使共产党夺回合法存在的权利。他说，这“不仅是共产党人所关心的，也是全体智利人民所关心的……迫害共产党人就等于迫害我国工人阶级和我国人民。”
    科尔巴兰强调指出，成立九党议会联盟具有重大意义。成立这个联盟的目的是为争取智利政治生活的民主化而斗争。参加这个联盟的有人民行动阵线（参加人民行动阵线的有五个政党，其中包括共产党）、农工党、国家党、天主教民主党和激进党。
    科尔巴兰指出，参加联盟者的出发点首先是民族的最高利益和“必须使智利的政治生活健康化”，虽然成立这个联盟并不意味着消除了各政党之间的严重的意见分歧。
