Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, March 31st: According to a TASS dispatch from Moscow, the law passed by the Soviet Supreme Soviet on further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations states that the current form of machine tractor stations providing technical services to collective farms no longer meets the requirements for further developing agricultural productivity. The law emphasizes that, like the reorganization of management work in industry and construction, the reorganization of machine tractor stations will also accelerate the pace of Soviet society towards communism.

The law points out that the Soviet Supreme Soviet believes it is necessary to reorganize machine tractor stations into technical repair stations. Tractors, combine harvesters, and other agricultural machinery belonging to machine tractor stations will be sold to collective farms and state farms starting this year. Agricultural machinery will be sold to collective farms that are willing to purchase them.

Technical repair stations established on the basis of machine tractor stations will repair tractors for collective farms, provide them with technical services, sell new machines, spare parts, petroleum products, and other commodities to collective farms and state farms, and organize the rental of various machines that collective farms do not have.

Regulations regarding technical repair stations and the rules for selling machinery, spare parts, and fuel to collective farms and state farms will be approved by the Soviet Council of Ministers. The law also addresses the issue of expanding credit to collective farms for production purposes and revising the current system and regulations for the procurement of agricultural products from collective farms. These matters will be entrusted to the Soviet Council of Ministers for handling.

The law states that socialist industry, and primarily heavy industry, plays a decisive role in ensuring the achievements of the national economy, because heavy industry is the foundation for strengthening the strength of the Soviet state and continuously improving the living standards of the people. Now, the public economy of collective farms is at a higher stage of development. This new stage can be demonstrated by the fact that the merged and expanded collective farms have, in recent years, become economically more consolidated, with more management departments and technically equipped farms, thanks to the strong assistance of the state. The income of collective farms has increased, and the material life of the members has improved.

The law points out that the issue of further developing the collective farm system and reorganizing machine tractor stations is of great significance for the successful solution of the tasks of Soviet communist construction.

    苏联最高苏维埃通过法律
    把农业机器卖给集体农庄  拖拉机站改为技术修理站
    新华社1日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科3月31日讯：苏联最高苏维埃通过的关于进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的法律说，经过机器拖拉机站对集体农庄提供技术服务的现行形式，已不再适应进一步发展农业生产力的要求了。法律强调指出，正如工业和建筑业管理工作的改组一样，机器拖拉机站的改组也将加速苏维埃社会向共产主义迈进的步伐。
    法律指出，苏联最高苏维埃认为必须把机器拖拉机站改组为技术修理站。属于机器拖拉机站的拖拉机、收获联合机和其他农业机器将从今年开始卖给集体农庄和国营农场。农业机器将卖给那些愿意购买的集体农庄。
    在机器拖拉机站基础上建立起来的技术修理站将修理集体农庄的拖拉机，对它们进行技术服务，向集体农庄和国营农场出售新的机器、备件、石油产品和其他商品，以及组织把集体农庄所没有的各种机器租给集体农庄的工作。
    关于技术修理站的条例和向集体农庄和国营农场出卖机器、备件和燃料的章程，将由苏联部长会议批准。法律还谈到扩大对集体农庄用于生产方面的信贷、以及对集体农庄农产品征购的现行制度和规章提出修改的问题。这些问题将委托苏联部长会议处理。
    法律说，在保证国民经济获得成就方面，社会主义工业，而首先是重工业起决定性的作用，因为重工业是加强苏维埃国家实力和不断提高人民生活水平的基础。现在，集体农庄的公有经济正处于更高的发展阶段。这个新阶段可以由下面的事实证明：合并扩大了的集体农庄近年来在国家大力帮助下已经成为经济上更巩固、经营部门更多并用技术装备起来的农庄了。集体农庄的收入增加了，庄员的物质生活提高了。
    法律指出，进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的问题，对于顺利解决苏联共产主义建设的任务具有非常重大的意义。
