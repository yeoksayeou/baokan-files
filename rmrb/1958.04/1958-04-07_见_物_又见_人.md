Seeing Both "Things" and "People"
    Wu Chuanqi

    A basic principle of dialectical materialism is: "Everything depends on conditions, place, and time." Therefore, when people do work, they must first study the objective conditions of the work and proceed from reality. However, people often have two different views of their objective conditions, one is "seeing things but not people," and the other is "seeing both things and people"; they have two different attitudes, one is an active and proactive attitude, and the other is a passive attitude. Thus, in work, they manifest as two different treatments, one is a promoting treatment, and the other is a hindering treatment; they manifest as two different methods, one is more, faster, better, and more economical; the other is less, slower, worse, and more wasteful.

    "Overthrow 'Condition-ism,' Strive to Catch Up with the Advanced." This is a thought-provoking headline on the front page of the People's Daily on February 25th. In the current movement against waste and conservatism, the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant compared themselves with other factories and mines, and found that more than 20 indicators were inferior to those of other factories, and they realized their backwardness. However, some people said that their indicators could not be compared with those of Anshan Iron and Steel, because Anshan Iron and Steel had better equipment and raw material conditions; the transportation indicators could not be compared with those of the railway department, because the railway department had complete conditions. Correspondingly, when people criticized the low indicators, they attributed it to objective conditions; if they were asked to raise the indicators, they wanted people, money, and equipment. The ideological basis of this "condition-ism" lies in the fact that they did not see the role of human subjective initiative, so they could only hinder things, not promote them.

    However, after a great debate, the workers of the Shijingshan Iron and Steel Plant realized that the conditions of all factories and mines in the country could not be exactly the same, and if they emphasized uniformity, they would cancel the comparison with the advanced; therefore, as long as it is conducive to promoting a high tide of production, they can compare with each other. They criticized conservative ideas, which aroused a great liberation of thought, and a high tide of comparing with the advanced appeared among the workers. People tried every means to tap potential, and a high tide of great leap forward in production indicators followed. Their current new indicators have reached or exceeded the advanced level in about ten items. That is to say, they did not attribute the reasons for backwardness to objective conditions, and as a result, they raised the indicators without adding money, people, or equipment. This is because they saw the role of people and brought into play their subjective initiative, so they can promote things.

    As far as the production activities of an industrial and mining enterprise are concerned, we fully acknowledge the decisive role of objective material factors such as equipment, raw materials, manpower, and financial resources, but this is only one side of the matter, that is, the "thing" side of the matter, and more importantly, there is another side of the matter, that is, the "people" side, that is, the aspect of people's subjective initiative. However, the "condition-ism" of the hindering faction only "sees things but not people," they "only see the existing material conditions, and do not see the great mass subjective initiative and creativity." Therefore, the Party Central Committee specially pointed out in the "Instructions on Launching the Movement Against Waste and Conservatism": "It is necessary to prevent the tendency of 'seeing things but not people'." Therefore, if we want to promote things, we must see both "things" and "people," both the existing material conditions and fully estimate the great mass subjective initiative and creativity.

    This "condition-ism" of "seeing things but not people" is often a one-sided argument of conservative ideas. Some are manifested as the special theory of departmental conditions, the so-called "others leap forward, but I can't." Some are manifested as the special theory of regions, believing that natural conditions are the only decisive factor for agricultural production, and can only rely on the heavens for food, and do not recognize that people are the decisive factor. In fact, life itself has constantly refuted these "condition-isms" with force. For example, between Pingyang and Huangyan counties in Zhejiang, the natural conditions are roughly the same, and the climatic conditions in Pingyang are even better; but in production, the average yield per mu in Huangyan is more than 200 jin higher than that in Pingyang, which is a prominent example. Making advanced achievements under poor material conditions, and the existence of very backward phenomena under good material conditions, there are many such vivid facts. All this shows that things are not only in the "thing" condition, but also in the "man-made" aspect.

    If we do not consider the subjective initiative of the masses and one-sidedly emphasize the "thing" condition, it is not to use "people" to control "things"; but to let "things" bind "people." If this is the case, everything can only "listen to fate." This is of course a fatalistic view, and a manifestation of lack of ambition.

    According to the laws of nature, people cannot swim in the water like fish; but people can learn to swim, or manufacture ships, and even create submarines to swim in the seabed. People cannot fly in the air like birds, but people can manufacture airplanes to carry people into the sky, traveling thousands of miles a day. The launch of the Soviet artificial satellite proves that one day, people may also realize interstellar space travel. Human activities cannot be separated from the constraints of natural laws, but people are not helpless about objective natural laws. And these amazing achievements are all created by people themselves, are the manifestation of human subjective initiative, and are not the gifts of God or nature.

    Natural conditions can be transformed, dry land can be turned into paddy fields, and water disasters can be turned into water conservancy. All material conditions can also be changed and created, and everything depends on human effort. The question lies in what attitude people take towards the various existing material conditions: are they passive or active? Do they succumb to difficulties and be frightened by them? Or do they muster their efforts, overcome difficulties, and extract the most wealth from nature?

    In our society today, due to the changes in production relations and the liberation of productive forces, the ever-increasing socialist enthusiasm and creativity of the people are infinite. We have all read in Marxist classics that once society is liberated, the liberated laborers will develop their productive forces at a speed exceeding any previous era; and this development is of course realized through the great subjective initiative of the working people. However, people's thinking often lags behind reality, and often underestimates the subjective initiative of the people, the so-called "seeing things but not people." It can be said that this is a manifestation of various conservative ideas.

    We advocate bringing into play the subjective initiative of the masses through the consciousness of the people, and of course we are not advocating blind action. Our so-called subjective initiative is premised on the subjectivity conforming to the objectivity. Only when people's activities conform to objective laws, people have the possibility of consciously influencing the surrounding life, which is what we call subjective initiative. If people only see the side of people dominating nature, they will become one-sided idealists. If people only see the side of nature dominating people, they will become metaphysical mechanists. Dialectical materialism recognizes both the domination of nature over people and the domination of people over nature. When people recognize objective laws and use them to seek welfare for people, the domination of nature over people is transformed into the domination of people over nature, and the relationship between people and nature is transformed from being dominated to becoming the dominator, and the "thing-in-itself" is transformed into the "thing-for-me." And this transformation is realized through people's subjective initiative.

    Therefore, in practice, if we "see things but not people," only see the existing objective material conditions, and do not see the subjective conditions of people, and do not see the creativity of people, the result is to hinder things. If we "see both things and people," both see the existing objective material conditions and fully estimate the subjective initiative of people, things can be promoted.

    见“物”又见“人”
    吴传启
    唯物主义辩证法有一条基本原理：“一切都依条件、地点和时间为转移。”所以人们做工作，必须首先研究工作的客观条件，从实际出发。然而人们对于自己所处的客观条件，往往有两种不同的观点，一种是“见物不见人”，一种是“见物又见人”；有两种不同的对待，一种是积极主动的态度，一种是消极被动的态度。从而在工作上，表现为两种不同的处理，一种是促进的处理；一种是促退的处理；表现为两种不同的方法，一种是多、快、好、省；一种是少、慢、差、费。
    “打倒‘条件论’，奋起追先进”。这是人民日报2月25日三版头条的一个发人深省的标题。石景山钢铁厂的职工们，在这一次反浪费、反保守的运动中，同其他厂矿进行了评比，发现有二十多项指标不如别的工厂，知道了自己的落后。可是有人说他们的指标不能同鞍钢比，因为鞍钢的设备和原料条件好；运输方面的指标不能同铁路部门比，因为铁路部门条件齐全。与此相应，当人们批评指标低了，他们就归咎于客观条件；如果要求提高指标，他们就要人、要钱、要设备。这种“条件论”的思想基础就在于他们没有看到人的主观能动性的作用，所以对事情只能促退，而不能促进。
    然而，石景山钢铁厂的职工们经过大辩论以后，认清全国各个厂矿的条件都不可能完全一样，如果强调一律，就会取消比先进；所以只要对促进生产高潮有利，就可以互相对比。他们批判了保守思想，引起了思想上的大解放，在职工群众中出现了比先进的热潮。人们千方百计地挖掘潜力，跟着出现了生产指标大跃进的高潮。他们目前的新指标，已约有十项达到或者超过了先进水平。也就是说，他们没有把落后的原因归咎于客观条件，结果是在没有加钱、加人、加设备的条件下，提高了指标。这是因为他们看到了人的作用，发挥了人的主观能动性，所以对事情就能促进。
    作为一个工矿企业的生产活动来说，我们完全承认设备、原料、人力和财力等等客观物质因素的决定作用，但这还只是事情的一面，即关于事情的“物”的一面，更重要的是还有事情的另一面，那就是关于“人”的方面，即关于人们的主观能动性的方面。但促退派的“条件论”却只“见物不见人”，他们“只看到现有的物质条件，看不到伟大的群众主观能动性和创造性。”因此党中央在“关于开展反浪费反保守运动的指示”中特别指出：“要防止‘见物不见人’的偏向”。所以我们如要把事情促进就必须见“物”而又见“人”，既看到现有的物质条件，又充分估计到伟大的群众主观能动性和创造性。
    这种“见物不见人”的“条件论”，往往是保守思想的一种片面的论据。有的表现为部门条件特殊论，所谓“人家跃进我不行”。有的表现为地区特殊论，认为自然条件对农业生产是唯一的决定因素，只能靠天吃饭，不承认事在人为。其实生活本身，早已不断地对这些“条件论”作了有力的驳斥。比如浙江的平阳和黄岩两县之间，自然条件大致相同，而且平阳的气候条件更好；但在生产上，黄岩的平均亩产量，却比平阳高出了二百斤以上，就是突出的例子。在差的物质条件下，做出先进的成绩，在好的物质条件下，却存在着十分落后的现象，这种生动事实是很多的。凡此种种，都说明了事情不仅在于“物”的条件方面，而且在于“人”为的方面。
    如果不考虑群众的主观能动性而片面地强调“物”的条件，就不是以“人”来驾驭“物”；而是让“物”来束缚“人”。如果这样，一切事情只能“听天由命”了。这当然是一种宿命论观点，是没有志气的表现。
    根据自然规律，人不能像鱼儿一样在水中游；但人们可以学会游泳，或者是制造轮船，以至造成潜水艇遨游海底。人不能像小鸟一样在空中飞行，但人可以制造飞机把人载入高空，日行万里。苏联人造卫星的发射，证明了有那么一天，人们还可能实现宇宙星际航行。人的活动不能脱离自然规律的制约，但人们对于客观的自然规律，也不是束手无策的。而这些惊人的成就，也都是人们自己创造的，是人的主观能动性的表现，并不是上帝或者自然的恩赐。
    自然条件是可以改造的，旱地可以变水田，水患可以变水利。一切物质条件也是可以改变的，可以创造的，一切事在人为。问题在于人们对于各种现有的物质条件采取怎样的态度去对待：是消极被动呢，还是积极主动？是向困难屈服，被困难吓倒呢？还是鼓起干劲，克服困难，向自然索取最多的财富。
    在我们今天的社会里，由于生产关系的变革，由于生产力的解放，因此人民群众日益增长的社会主义积极性和创造力是无穷的。我们从马克思主义经典著作上都读到过，当社会一经获得解放，解放了的劳动者，将以超过从前任何时代的速度来发展自己的生产力；而这种发展当然也就是通过劳动人民群众的伟大的主观能动性来实现的。然而，人们的思想往往落后于实际，往往对人民群众的主观能动性估计不足，即所谓“见物不见人”。可以说，这是各种保守思想的表现。
    我们主张通过人民群众的自觉来发挥群众的主观能动性，当然不是提倡盲目行动。我们所谓的主观能动性，是以主观符合于客观为前提的。只有人们的活动符合于客观规律的时候，人们才具有自觉地影响周围生活的可能，这就是我们所说的主观能动性。如果人们只看到人支配自然的一面，就要变成片面的唯心主义者。如果人们只看到自然支配人的一面，就要变成形而上学的机械论者。辩证唯物主义既承认自然对人的支配，又承认人对自然的支配。当人们认识了客观规律，利用它为人谋福利的时候，自然对人的支配，就转化为人对自然的支配，人同自然的关系，就是由被支配向支配者转化，“自在之物”就转化为“为我之物”。而这种转化，就是通过人们的主观能动性来实现的。
    所以在实践上，如果“见物不见人”，只看到现有的客观物质条件，看不到人的主观条件，看不到人们的创造力，结果就是促退。如果“见物又见人”，既看到现有的客观物质条件，又充分估计到人的主观能动作用，事情就能促进。
