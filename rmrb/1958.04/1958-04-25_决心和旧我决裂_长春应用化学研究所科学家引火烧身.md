Resolving to Break with the Old Self
Scientists at the Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry Set Fire to Themselves

(Our Dispatch) Recently, the Changchun Institute of Applied Chemistry of the Chinese Academy of Sciences convened a general meeting of all staff and researchers. At the meeting, the director, deputy directors, and some senior researchers made sincere self-criticisms in the spirit of "setting fire to themselves."

Wu Xuezhou, academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences and director of the Institute of Applied Chemistry, made a serious self-exposure and criticism of his bourgeois scientific research ideology and his pursuit of fame and profit at the meeting. He said: Although I verbally admit that scientific research must serve socialism, in reality, I have spread bourgeois scientific research ideas. In this way, the scientific research work of the institute has been guided onto the capitalist road. He said that the academic-style research is seriously divorced from reality and cannot well serve the country's economic construction. In the selection of research topics, the country's current urgent needs are not considered. In fact, it is advocating research for the sake of research, and theory for the sake of theory. When he criticized his bourgeois ideas of fame and profit, he said: I was born into an exploiting-class family, and I had a strong desire to climb up very early on. The reason why I have a strong interest in academic-style research is inseparable from my ideas of relying on literature to find topics and becoming famous by writing papers. I also regard this institute as my own private capital. For example, when the organization transferred researchers to the institute, I once lost my temper, thinking that it was deliberately trying to undermine me.

Qian Baogong, director of the Synthetic Research Office, examined his understanding of "red and expert" and the problems in his relationship with comrades. He said: After this ideological examination, I deeply feel that "red and expert" is especially important to me. In order to be both red and expert, I am determined to transform my bourgeois ideology, stand firm on the proletarian position, give my heart to the Party, give my knowledge to the people, and strive to become a scientific worker who is both red and expert, and even redder and more expert.

Deputy Director Sun Jingbin examined his mistakes in implementing the Party's policy on intellectuals, such as less criticism and more care for scientists, emphasizing unity and neglecting transformation. The formula of "unity-criticism-unity" has not been conscientiously implemented. As a result, he condoned bourgeois ideology and hindered the ideological transformation of scientists. In the implementation of the policy of "letting a hundred flowers bloom and a hundred schools of thought contend," he also mistakenly believed that there was nothing to contend in research institutions. He did not realize that there are differences and struggles in scientific research work, and the fundamental difference is the struggle between two roads.

Chen Qi, director of the Analytical Research Office, and Zhang Dingzhao, a researcher at the Physical Chemistry Research Office, also spoke at the meeting. They also made sincere examinations.

Everyone felt that their examinations spoke their minds, dug out the roots of their thoughts, and showed their determination to break with their old selves. Under their impetus and influence, many people have taken the initiative to propose self-examination.

    决心和旧我决裂
    长春应用化学研究所科学家引火烧身
    本报讯　最近，中国科学院长春应用化学研究所召开了全所工作人员和研究人员大会。会上，所长、副所长和部分高级研究人员都以引火烧身的精神，作了诚恳的思想检查。
    中国科学院学部委员、应用化学研究所所长吴学周，在会上就他个人的资产阶级科学研究思想和名利思想，作了严肃的自我揭露和批判。他说：在口头上我虽然承认科学研究必须为社会主义服务，但在实际上却散布着资产阶级的科学研究思想。这样，就把所里的科学研究工作引导到资本主义的道路上去了。他说，学院式的研究严重地脱离了实际，不能很好地为国家经济建设服务。在研究题目的选择上，也不考虑国家当前是否迫切需要。实际上就是提倡为研究而研究，为理论而理论。在他批判到自己的资产阶级名利思想时说道：我出身于剥削阶级家庭，很早以前，就有强烈的向上爬的思想。我之所以对学院式的研究有浓厚的兴趣，是和我靠文献找题目，作论文就成名的名利思想分不开的。我还把本所看成是自己的私人资本。如组织上调所里的研究人员时，就曾经发过脾气，认为是有意拆自己的台。
    合成研究室主任钱保功检查了对红与专的认识和对同志之间的关系方面的问题。他说：经过这次思想检查，使我深深感到红与专对我特别重要。为了红透专深，我决心改造资产阶级思想，站稳无产阶级立场，把心交给党，把知识交给人民，力争成为又红又专、更红更专的科学工作者。
    孙景斌副所长检查了他在执行党的知识分子政策上的错误，如对科学家的批评少、照顾多，强调了团结，忽视了改造。“团结——批评——团结”的公式没有得到认真贯彻。因而迁就了资产阶级思想，妨碍了科学家的思想改造。在执行百家争鸣的政策上，他也错误地认为，研究机关没啥可争。没有认识到科学研究工作中是存在着分歧和斗争的，其中根本分歧是两条道路的斗争。
    在这次会上发言的还有分析研究室主任陈琪和物化研究室研究员张定钊。他们也都作了诚恳的检查。
    他们的检查，大家都感到是说出了心里话，挖出了思想根，是有决心和旧我决裂的。在他们的带动影响下，不少人都主动提出要作自我检查。
