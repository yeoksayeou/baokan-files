Hohhot, an ancient city beyond the Great Wall (Hohhot in Mongolian means "blue city"), is undergoing rapid changes. In the morning, the Daqing Mountains north of the city and the entire city are shrouded in mist. High-rise buildings, chimneys, and water towers are hidden among the ancient city walls, drum towers, and Sumu temples (lama temples). Between the new city and the old city, the original wasteland and small plots of farmland, separated by five or six *li*, have now been paved into a wide avenue, with countless high-rise buildings erected. Since liberation, the total construction area of new houses in the city has reached more than 1.35 million square meters, almost equivalent to building another Hohhot. Before liberation, there were only six buildings here; now there are 148 various new-style buildings. In the past, there was only one cement road less than three *li* long in front of the railway station; now there are twelve asphalt, cement, and gravel roads, totaling more than fifty *li*. The drainage system is 33,000 meters long, an increase of more than eighty-one times compared to before liberation.

Before liberation, the "ancient city beyond the Great Wall" was a consumer city serving the reactionary rulers. By the time of liberation in 1949, there were only nine dilapidated small factories, including flour, clothing, sacks, and power plants. However, fur merchants, grain stores, tea houses, hotels, opium dens, and brothels that exploited the herdsmen of minority nationalities were all over the streets. Now, it is a completely different scene. Walking west from the Drum Tower in the new city, you can see the newly built department store building, the cinema palace, the magnificent Inner Mongolia Museum, as well as the office building of the People's Committee of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region, the hotel building, and the People's Hospital. Crossing the tree-lined cement road, there are the joint venture store, Xinhua Bookstore, People's Bank, Workers' Cultural Palace, and Trade Union Building.

Since liberation, the Party's ethnic policies have gradually made this city a base for changing the backwardness of the autonomous region. Now, the city's industrial output value accounts for 84.2% of the city's total industrial and agricultural output value. The city now has 70 factories, including licorice extract factories, wool textile factories, agricultural machinery factories, flour mills, oil mills, and iron factories, with more than 9,200 employees of all nationalities, an increase of seventeen times compared to the early days of liberation. Animal-drawn mowers, double-wheel double-share plows, Liberation-style waterwheels, boilers, mine cars, radios, radiators, machine-made bricks and tiles, navy serge, etc., can all be produced locally.

Hohhot's cultural and educational undertakings have also developed rapidly. There are four well-equipped universities here, including Inner Mongolia University, Inner Mongolia Medical College, Inner Mongolia Normal College, and Inner Mongolia College of Animal Husbandry and Veterinary Medicine, with a total of more than 2,500 college students of all nationalities. The number of students in secondary vocational schools, general middle schools, and primary schools for all nationalities has now reached more than 45,000.

In Hohhot, the most profound change is the emergence of a new national relationship of unity and fraternity among all ethnic groups. Whether in factories, government offices, schools, or on the streets, people of all ethnic groups can be seen working and living together, regardless of each other. Mao Yihan, a Mongolian folk ballad singer, wrote a "Haolaibao" to praise the changes in Hohhot:

"Opening the myriad volumes of Mongolian history,
There is no such record on any page.
Only because we have you, Chairman Mao,
Did the people create dreamlike miracles."

### 呼和浩特——内蒙古自治区首府

专栏：民族自治地方城市风光

    呼和浩特——内蒙古自治区首府
    塞外古城呼和浩特（蒙语，意为青色的城）的面貌正在日新月异。早晨，城北大青山和全市上空笼罩在一片雾气里，高楼、烟囱和水塔隐现在古城堞、鼓楼和召庙（喇嘛庙）之间。在新城与旧城之间，原来相隔五、六里的荒滩和小块田地，现在已铺起一条宽阔的大马路，耸起无数幢高楼。从解放到现在，全市新房屋的建筑面积已达一百三十五万多平方公尺，几乎等于另建一个呼和浩特。这里在解放前只有六幢楼房，现有各种新式楼房一百四十八幢。过去只有车站前一条不到三里的水泥马路，如今柏油路、水泥路、石子路有十二条，长达五十多里。下水道有三万三千公尺，比解放前增加八十一倍多。
    解放前，“塞外古城”一直是个为反动统治者服务的消费城市，到1949年解放时止，这里只有面粉、被服、麻袋、发电厂等九个残破的小型工厂；而剥削少数民族牧民的皮毛商、粮店以及茶馆、酒店、鸦片馆、妓院等却遍设街头巷尾。现在，已完全是另一番景象了。从新城鼓楼往西走，就看到新建的百货商店大楼、电影宫和规模宏大的内蒙古博物馆，以及内蒙古自治区人民委员会办公大楼、宾馆大楼、人民医院。穿过林荫水泥马路，那里是联营商店、新华书店、人民银行、工人文化宫、工会大厦。
    解放后，党的民族政策已使这个城市逐渐成为改变自治区落后面貌的基地。现在，这个城市的工业产值已占全市工农业总产值的84.2％。全市已有甘草膏厂、毛纺织厂、农业机械厂、面粉厂、榨油厂、铁工厂等七十个工厂，各民族职工已达九千二百多人，比解放初期增长了十七倍。马拉割草机、双轮双铧犁、解放式水车、锅炉、矿车、收音机、暖气片、机制砖瓦、海军呢等都能自己生产。
    呼和浩特的文化教育事业也发展得很快。这里有设备完善的内蒙古大学、内蒙古医学院、内蒙古师范学院和内蒙古畜牧兽医学院等四所高等学校，共有二千五百多名各族大学生。中等专业学校、普通中学和各民族小学的学生目前已达四万五千多名。
    在呼和浩特市，使人感到变化最深刻的，是各族人民之间出现了团结友爱的新的民族关系。不论在工厂、机关、学校或是街道上，到处可以看到各族人民不分彼此地在一起工作和生活。蒙古族民间说唱诗人毛依罕写了一首“好来宝”来歌颂呼和浩特的变化：
    “翻开蒙古民族的万卷历史，
    哪一页上也没有这样的记载。
    只因为有了你啊，毛主席，
    人民才创造了梦幻般的奇迹”。
