    Leishan Miao People's Spring Plowing
    (Our report) The Miao people in Leishan County, Guizhou Province, nestled in the Miaoling Mountains, have initially changed the drought-stricken face of the mountainous area after a winter of hard work. More than 77,000 mu of the county's 81,000 mu of rice paddies have been irrigated. Even if it does not rain for 40 to 50 days, normal rice growth can be guaranteed. At present, Miao commune members are starting to use the newly completed 378 mountain ponds, reservoirs, and ditches to divert water from Leigong Mountain, the main peak of Miaoling, to more than 36,000 mu of Wangtianshui fields that have historically been threatened by drought, and are starting to transform more than 4,900 mu of sloping land into terraced fields, setting off an early spring plowing upsurge.
    Leishan County in the Qiandongnan Miao and Dong Autonomous Prefecture is a large mountainous area inhabited by the Miao people. Because the fields are high and the water is low, rice paddies above the mountainside have often suffered from drought in the past.

    雷山苗族人民春耕
    本报讯　苗岭盘亘的贵州雷山县苗族人民，经过一冬苦战，初步改变了山区干旱面貌，全县八万一千多亩稻田中已有七万七千亩得到了水利灌溉，即使四十天到五十天不下雨，也能保证水稻正常生长。目前苗族社员们正开始利用新完工的三百七十八处山塘水库和沟渠，把苗岭主峰雷公山上的水引向三万六千多亩历来常受旱灾威胁的望天水田，并着手变四千九百多亩坡土为梯田，提前掀起了春耕高潮。
    黔东南苗族侗族自治州雷山县是一个苗族聚居的大山区，由于田高水低，境内半山以上的稻田过去经常受旱。
