A New Style
	Cheng Yu

The First Automobile Works boldly enriches and develops advanced technology with the practical experience of our working masses, breaks through design capabilities, and increases the annual automobile production from 30,000 to 70,000 vehicles without increasing any investment or equipment. This news is not only encouraging, but more importantly, it helps people open their minds!

The First Automobile Works' example is an example of the Great Leap Forward. It signifies the Great Leap Forward in China's automobile industry, the Great Leap Forward in transportation, and the Great Leap Forward in the machinery industry. This Great Leap Forward not only has targets, measures, and drive, but also displays a style—a communist style!

The characteristic of this style is first and foremost the workers' revolutionary spirit, which is like a powerful force. They dare to boldly imagine, dare to break through the original design capabilities, and dare to greatly improve the original, already quite advanced, level of technology. In this way, they break through the shackles of technical thinking, eliminate superstition, and enable everyone to stand on a higher foundation to oppose conservative ideas. In this magnificent wave, the old ideas, old styles, and many rules and regulations that hinder the Great Leap Forward in production within the factory are broken through, and the suppressed new forces and advanced things raise their heads and shout loudly.

Another characteristic of this style is a down-to-earth and cautious approach in action; unifying strategically looking down on difficulties and tactically taking difficulties seriously. They implement the principle of boldly mobilizing the masses and conducting everything through experiments, first conducting industrial tests on the established targets, then workshop tests; from one workshop to several workshops, and finally conducting a plant-wide production inspection. The plant-wide inspection is also a large experiment, and it must be repeatedly tested several times. The communist revolutionary spirit is precisely combined with this scientific attitude and with this spirit of hard work and practical work.

We communists are also dialectical materialists, and our style is the combination of bold ideals and scientific attitude. Only bold ideals without a scientific attitude will turn bold ideals into illusions; only a scientific attitude without bold ideals will turn the scientific attitude into creeping empiricism. The value of the production inspection at the First Automobile Works lies in the fact that they embodied the combination of the two in this action; this is of particular educational significance in the current situation. Because scientific problems must be dealt with in a scientific manner. Technical reforms must be taken very seriously, carefully, and practically, and must not be taken lightly.

The style of the production inspection at the First Automobile Works not only embodies the style of the Great Leap Forward in China's socialist construction; it embodies the style of the sustained and in-depth rectification campaign, but also foreshadows the style of the technological revolution. This factory exposed and solved more than 2,000 key production problems (most of which were key technical problems) during the production inspection. With a bold spirit of innovation, the workers dared to enrich and develop modern industrial technology with new experiences suitable for China's specific conditions in order to improve productivity. On the other hand, China's socialist productive forces require a great development of cooperative relations among enterprises, which is also one of the most prominent problems solved by the First Automobile Works during the production inspection. Production collaboration is also part of the technological revolution. Therefore, the new cooperative relations developed in this factory during the production inspection are bound to foster a new style for the technological revolution.

May this new style be popularized in all production departments and administrative work, and become a conscious common style of the Chinese people!

    新的风格
    程予
    第一汽车制造厂大胆地以我国工人群众的实践经验丰富和发展先进技术，突破了设计能力，不增加任何投资和设备，就使汽车年产量从三万辆增加到七万辆。这则消息不仅给人以鼓舞，更重要的是它帮助人们打开脑筋！
    第一汽车厂的事例是跃进的事例。它标志着我国汽车工业的跃进，交通运输业的跃进和机械工业的跃进。这种跃进不仅有指标、有措施、有干劲，而且显示出一种风格——共产主义的风格！
    这种风格的特点首先是职工们势如破竹的革命气魄。他们敢于大胆设想，敢于突破原来的设计能力，敢于把原来已经是相当先进的技术水平再大大提高，这样，他们就冲破了技术思想的束缚，破除了迷信使大家立于更高的基础上反对保守思想。在这种气势磅礴的巨浪中，厂内存在的旧思想、旧作风和许多阻碍生产跃进的规章制度被突破了，被压抑的新生力量和先进事物抬起头来大喊大叫了。
    这种风格的另一特点是行动上的踏实谨慎；把战略上轻视困难和战术上重视困难统一起来。他们贯彻了放手发动群众，一切通过试验的原则，把既定指标先通过工部试验，再通过车间试验；由一个车间到几个车间的试验，最后才进行全厂生产大检阅。大检阅也是大试验，而且要反复地试验几次。共产主义的革命气魄正是和这种科学态度相结合，和这种苦干、实干的精神相结合的。
    我们共产主义者又是辩证唯物主义者，它的风格就是大胆理想和科学态度的结合。只有大胆理想没有科学态度，就会使大胆理想变成虚幻；只有科学态度而无大胆理想，也会使科学态度成为爬行的经验主义。第一汽车厂生产大检阅的可贵，就在于他们用这一行动体现了两者间的结合；这在当前情况下，是特别富有教育意义的。因为科学的问题必须以科学的态度来对付。技术上的改革必须十分认真、仔细、踏实，决不可掉以轻心。
    第一汽车厂生产大检阅的风格，不仅体现我国社会主义建设大跃进的风格；体现了全民整风持续深入的风格，而且还预示了技术革命的风格。这个厂在生产大检阅中暴露和解决了生产关键问题（其中大部是技术关键问题）达两千多个。职工们以大胆的创造精神，敢于以适合我国具体情况的新经验来丰富和发展现代化的工业技术，以达到提高生产力的目的。另一方面，我国社会主义的生产力，要求大大发展企业中的协作关系，这也是第一汽车厂在生产大检阅中解决得最为突出的问题之一。生产协作也是技术革命的一部分，因此，这个厂在生产大检阅中发展起来的新的协作关系，必然为技术革命孕育起新的风格。
    愿这种新的风格在各个生产部门和机关工作中普及开来，成为我国人民自觉的共同的风格！
