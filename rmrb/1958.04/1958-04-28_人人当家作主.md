Everyone is Master of Their Own House

The Song Deyou Youth Model Group in the foundry workshop of the Harbin Locomotive and Rolling Stock Repair Factory has a total of nine people. They learned from the experience of Qinghua Tool Factory, with each person or two people in charge of a management task, conducting comprehensive management of the group's production, technology, and economy. They evaluate each person's production performance themselves and review their own production quotas. In April, the entire group completed the monthly production plan sixteen days ahead of schedule.

Top left picture: Workers hold "housekeeping meetings" before and after shifts to arrange the day's production plan and identify problems in production. Everyone contributes ideas and solves problems themselves, changing the past habit of looking for cadres to solve everything, big or small.

Top right picture: Gan Chengyi, the group's labor discipline inspector, records the group's workers' production situation a few minutes before the end of work. In the past, he was often late and sneaked into the workshop behind the back of the attendance recorder. After becoming his own master in March, he had perfect attendance for the whole month and was never late.

    人人当家作主
    哈尔滨机车车辆修理工厂翻砂车间宋德有青年模型小组，共有九个人。他们学习庆华工具厂的经验，每人或两个人分管一项管理工作，对小组的生产、技术、经济进行全面管理。他们自己评比每个人的生产成绩、审核自己的生产定额。4月份全组提前十六天完成了全月生产计划。
    上左图：工人们在班前班后开“管家会”，布置当天生产计划和找出生产中的问题。大家出主意，自己动手解决，改变过去事无大小都找干部解决的习惯。
    上右图：小组劳动纪律监察员甘成义在下班前几分钟，把小组工人当天生产情况纪录下来。过去他常迟到，背着考勤员溜进车间。3月份自己当家以后，全月出了满勤，从来不迟到。
