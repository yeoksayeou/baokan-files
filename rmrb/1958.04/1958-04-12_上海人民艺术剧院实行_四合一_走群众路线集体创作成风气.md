The Shanghai People's Art Theatre Implements "Four-in-One"
    Adopts Mass Line and Collective Creation Becomes the Norm
    (Our reporter Zhang Feng reports) The Shanghai People's Art Theatre has created fifteen plays in just over a month. This "miracle" has attracted great attention in Shanghai's literary and artistic circles.
    Two months ago, the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Culture proposed that the Shanghai People's Art Theatre create thirty plays within the year. This number startled the leaders of the Shanghai People's Art Theatre. They thought: in the past, there was a professional "creation workshop," and it only produced one multi-act play, several one-act plays, and one skit in three or four years. Now, everyone is creating in their spare time, but they are expected to produce thirty plays in a year! This seems impossible.
    Just then, the raging fire of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign ignited! The Bureau of Culture instructed the theatre to hand over the creation plan to the masses for discussion. Comrades who signed up to participate in amateur creation enthusiastically reported the number of plays they would create, totaling sixty-nine.
    The theatre then convened a conference of creative personnel, conveying the spirit of the Shanghai Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China's call for a great leap forward in the literary and art world, emphasizing "conscious and voluntary action, forcing oneself to climb the mountain," and "working hard for three months to change the face of things." Participants saw the inspiring situation and recognized that literature and art must keep up with the great leap forward in production. The theatre also proposed that in three months, they would stage a multi-act play and three one-act plays written in-house. Everyone's enthusiasm was even higher, and the number of creations doubled again, with a total of one hundred and forty-one plays to be written throughout the year. More than eighty people participated in amateur creation, with directors, actors, and other artistic cadres participating in the creation, accounting for 86% of the total number of artistic cadres. The deputy secretary of the Party branch and the propaganda committee member took the lead and wrote a one-act play in just a few days.
    In this way, creation has become a mass movement. No one is closing themselves off for individual creation anymore, and collective creation has become the norm. People talk about stories and outlines in groups of two or three. Some recalled peasant friends they had made during the land reform, some thought of their younger brother who was a surveying team member, and some thought of their "five-good" model aunt. Some even spontaneously went to factories to make friends and find materials. In this atmosphere of enthusiastic and creative fervor, where "everything is about creation," the theatre leadership stipulated that there would be two and a half "creation days" each week, while also proposing "go deep into life, combine freely, and create collectively." The first group of more than ten people went to a factory to participate in the workers' anti-waste and anti-conservatism campaign, and quickly wrote seven plays. Then, all the amateur creative personnel in the theatre were divided into seventeen groups, and they were all mobilized to go to factories and the grassroots. Now, fifteen plays have been submitted, and three one-act plays have been rehearsed and will be performed on a tour of factories next month. A four-act, five-scene skit, under the guidance of actors from the Shanghai People's Art Theatre, is being toured by the amateur drama troupe of railway workers among the railway workers along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. Serving the "Movement" and the "Amateur"
    When amateur creative personnel came to the factory, they joined the vigorous anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, doing whatever the masses needed them to do. When the factory wanted to hold a leap forward conference, they wrote entertainment programs. A group that went to the No. 6 State Cotton Mill wrote a "Watermelon Dance" to encourage everyone to seize watermelons during rectification, winning stormy applause from the workers. Some, upon arriving at the factory, first sought out amateur literary and art groups to help them solve difficulties, guide them in their performances, and compile singing and storytelling materials based on real people and events. Now, the Shanghai People's Art Theatre has put forward the slogan: "Serve while collecting materials," and the purpose of collecting materials is also to serve, opposing the idea of creating for the sake of creation.
    In terms of creative methods, the Shanghai People's Art Theatre proposed to "ask the masses for advice in three ways": first, listen to the masses tell stories; second, tell the masses about outlines; and third, read lines to the masses. They not only engaged in collective creation within the theatre but also engaged in collective creation with the masses. A group that went to the Shanghai Railway Administration went to the railway to write a play about the historical miracle of the Shanghai-Nanjing express train creating a time of three hours and fifty-two minutes. On the first day, they talked to many people about the material and rushed to create a scene-by-scene outline overnight. On the second day, they took it to the railway to solicit opinions. The Railway Bureau Party Committee received the outline, discussed it immediately, and helped to revise it. After listening to the outline, the employees actively raised objections to the places that violated the reality of life. After the lines were written, they were read to the employees several times, and the employees put forward many vivid words and heroic lines. Then, they helped the railway workers' amateur drama troupe perform the four-act, five-scene skit "Riding the Wind and Breaking the Waves," and absorbed mass opinions and revised it during rehearsals and tours.
    The Shanghai People's Art Theatre also stipulates that all created plays should first be performed by workers' amateur drama groups. This not only solves the problem of the outlet for a large number of created plays but also strongly supports the development of the mass literary and art movement, creating a prerequisite for improvement on the basis of popularization.
    Seek Speed First, Then Precision
    Carrying out creation in the form of a mass movement requires ensuring a certain quality on the basis of a large quantity. The Shanghai People's Art Theatre has a quality plan: among the one hundred and forty-one plays, it is required that 5%, or seven plays, reach the level of national performance, and the remaining plays should generally be up to the standard of amateur drama groups. Because most of the comrades who participate in amateur creation have never written plays, and some lack basic knowledge of playwriting, if quality is emphasized first, it will frustrate the enthusiasm of the masses. Therefore, the Shanghai People's Art Theatre first emphasizes quantity and speed, extensively reflecting the current appearance of the mass revolutionary movement, and letting the plays go to the audience for testing and revision. At the same time, the theatre implements a combination of general guidance and key assistance to achieve the purpose of guaranteeing and improving quality.
    In terms of general guidance, the Shanghai People's Art Theatre's approach is to: focus on outlines and common problems. Before each group starts writing a play, they first write an outline and give it to the literary group for research to see if there is a possibility of developing it into a play, and give assistance in further collecting materials and writing. Then, find some common problems in creation and invite experts to give reports or hold symposiums to jointly study and discuss them. In addition, all plays written are given artistic processing and modification by the literary group.
    Among the fifteen plays currently created, some have relatively promising development prospects. For example, the multi-act skit "Riding the Wind and Breaking the Waves," which writes about railway workers creating a new record for the Shanghai-Nanjing express train. The author of the play participates in the tour performances of the amateur drama troupe, constantly absorbs audience opinions and revises it, and also plans to live among the railway workers for a longer period of time and write more small plays.
    In order to consolidate and further develop the achievements that have been made, the Shanghai People's Art Theatre has compiled the personnel participating in amateur creation into twenty-four groups, which are permanently and deeply rooted in the grassroots, implementing "four-in-one," that is, creation, guidance, labor training, and making friends with workers, are carried out together in this base. By adopting this "four-in-one" approach, various tasks and ideological transformation are closely integrated, creating favorable conditions for cultivating spoken drama workers who are both red and expert.

### 上海人民艺术剧院实行“四合一”  走群众路线集体创作成风气

    上海人民艺术剧院实行“四合一”
    走群众路线集体创作成风气
    本报讯　记者张风报道：上海人民艺术剧院在一个多月的时间内，创作了十五个剧本。这个“奇迹”引起上海文艺界很大的注意。
    两个月前，上海市文化局向上海人民艺术剧院提出年内创作三十个剧本。这个数字使上海人艺的领导同志大吃一惊，他们想：过去有一个专业的“创作工场”，三、四年中只写出一个多幕剧，几个独幕剧和一个活报剧，现在都是业余搞创作，一年却要三十个！这似乎是办不到的。
    正在这时，反浪费反保守的烈火烧起来了！文化局指示剧院把创作规划交给群众去讨论。报名参加业余创作的同志纷纷自报创作数量，总数是六十九个。
    剧院接着又召开创作人员大会，传达中共上海市委提出的文艺界大跃进要“自觉自愿，自我逼上梁山”，要“苦干三月，改变面貌”。参加会议的人员看到令人振奋的形势，认识到文艺必须跟上生产大跃进。剧院还提出三个月后，要上演自编的一个多幕剧和三个独幕剧。大家的劲头更高了，创作数字再翻一番，全年写出一百四十一个剧本。参加业余创作的人员达到八十多人，导演、演员等艺术干部参加创作的，占到艺术干部总人数86％。党支部副书记和宣传委员首先动手，几天内就写出一个独幕剧。
    这样，创作形成了一个群众运动。再也没有人关起门来单干创作，集体创作成了一种风气。人们三三两两地谈故事，讲提纲，有的想起了参加土地改革中结交的农民朋友，有的想到了做勘察队员的弟弟，“五好”模范的姑妈，有的还自发地下厂交朋友，找材料。就在这样群情奋发，“言必及创作”的形势下，剧院领导上一面规定每周有两个半天的“创作日”，同时提出“深入生活，自由结合，集体创作”。第一批组织十多个人下厂，参加工人的反浪费反保守运动，很快就写出了七个剧本。接着又把全院业余创作人员分成十七个组，全面出动，下厂下基层。现在十五个剧本已经交卷，三个独幕剧已经排好，下月就要到工厂中去巡回演出。一个四幕五场的活报剧，在上海人艺演员的辅导下，正由铁路工人业余剧团在沪宁，沪杭沿线铁路工人中巡回演出。为“运动”，为“业余”服务
    业余创作人员来到了工厂，就参加到轰轰烈烈的反浪费反保守运动中去，群众需要他们干什么，就干什么。厂里要开跃进大会，他们就编余兴节目。到国棉六厂的一个小组，编了一个“西瓜舞”，鼓舞大家在整改中抓西瓜，赢得了工人们暴风雨般的掌声。有的一下厂，先找业余文艺团体，帮助他们解决困难，辅导他们演出，编出真人真事的说唱材料。现在上海人艺提出了这样的口号：“边服务，边取材”，取材的目的也是为了服务，反对为创作而创作的思想。
    在创作的方法上，上海人艺提出要向群众“三请教”：一听群众讲故事，二向群众讲提纲，三跟群众念台词。他们不但在剧院内部搞集体创作，还和群众在一起搞集体创作。去上海铁路管理局的一个组，到铁路上写上海南京间特别快车创造三小时五十二分的历史奇迹的剧本，第一天找了许多人谈素材，连夜赶出一个分幕提纲，第二天带到铁路上征求意见。铁路局党委接到提纲，马上讨论，帮助修改。职工们听了提纲，对违反生活真实的地方积极提意见。台词编出来之后，好几次念给职工听，职工提出了好多生动的语汇和豪迈气概的台词。接着又帮助铁路工人业余剧团演出这个四幕五场的活报剧“乘风破浪”，在排练和巡回演出中再吸收群众意见修改。
    上海人艺还规定一条：所有创作的剧本，首先给工人业余戏剧团体上演。这样，不仅解决了大量创作出来的剧本的出路问题，而且大力支持了群众文艺运动的开展，为在普及基础上的提高创造了前提。
    先求快，后求精
    以群众运动的方式搞创作，需要在数量多的基础上保证一定的质量。上海人艺有一个关于质量的规划：在一百四十一个剧本中，要求有5％，即七个剧本达到全国演出的水平，其余的剧本，一般也要够得上业余剧团上演的标准。由于参加业余创作的同志，大部分没有写过剧本，有的还缺乏编剧的基本知识，如果首先强调质量，就会挫折群众的积极性。所以，上海人艺首先强调的多、快，大量地反映当前群众革命运动的面貌，让剧本到观众中去考验，去修改。同时，在剧院内实行普遍指导和重点帮助相结合，达到保证和提高质量的目的。
    在普遍指导方面，上海人艺采取的办法是：抓提纲，抓共同问题。各个组在动手写剧本之前，先写出提纲，给文学组研究，有没有发展成为一个剧本的可能，在进一步收集材料和写作上给以帮助。然后找出一些创作上的共同问题，请专家来作报告，或者召开座谈会，共同研究和讨论。另外，所有剧本写出以后，都由文学组给予艺术上的加工和修饰。
    现在创作的十五个剧本中，有一些是比较有发展前途的。如写铁路工人创造沪宁快车新纪录的多幕活报剧“乘风破浪”。剧本的作者一面参加业余剧团的巡回演出，不断吸收观众意见进行修改，同时还打算较长期深入在铁路工人中生活，多写一些小型的剧本。
    为了巩固和进一步发展已经取得的成就，上海人艺把参加业余创作的人员编成二十四个组，长期固定深入生活的基点，实行“四合一”，即创作、辅导、劳动锻炼以及和工人交朋友，四者一起在这个基点内进行。采取了这种“四合一”的办法，各项工作与思想改造就紧密地结合起来，为培养又红又专的话剧工作者创造了有利的条件。
