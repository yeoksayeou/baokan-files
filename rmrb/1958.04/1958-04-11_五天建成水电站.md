    Hydroelectric Power Station Built in Five Days
    By our reporter Yin Chongjing
    On March 23rd, on the east bank of the Grand Canal, a large-character poster full of poetic and artistic flavor appeared on the street of Chenguantun Village:
    Five days from today, we will complete the hydroelectric power station.
    Five days from today, the power station will chop grass and grind flour for us;
    Five days from today, electric lights will illuminate the night like day;
    Five days from today, women will do needlework under the electric lights;
    Five days from today, we will use radio to listen to good news about socialist construction, and listen to the government's guidance for us.
    Five days from today, ah, to welcome you, we will work desperately!
    Chenguantun is an ordinary village in Jinghai County, Hebei. Last winter, the farmers had just dug a canal to bring water from the Grand Canal to irrigate the fields. This spring, the county committee, considering the farmers' demands after the realization of water conservancy, decided to use this canal to build a small hydroelectric power station. At half past midnight on the 22nd, the county party secretary made a long-distance call to the township party secretary here, saying that the county committee had decided to build a station in Chenguantun, requiring it to be completed in five days, "Do you have any difficulties?" The township party secretary was overjoyed when he heard this, and immediately notified the production teams of the agricultural cooperative to hold meetings to mobilize the masses. Then the whole village was stirred up.
    The county committee, based on the current urgent need for electricity in rural areas and limited economic conditions, put forward a clear requirement for building the station: spend as little money as possible and generate electricity as quickly as possible. The Party's call immediately turned into action by the farmers, who immediately launched a "material contribution" campaign, vying to take out their old wooden boards, old roof beams, broken tables, and broken cabinets from their homes as investment in the station. Cooperative committee member Hao Lanxiang personally led people to demolish his own courtyard wall and take out a lot of stone. The large stone roller with a diameter of three feet eight inches in Wei Guodong's home had been in the village for seventy-five years, and this time it was decided to contribute it. He said: "The stone roller has worked hard all its life, and its task is completed. Taking it to build a power station will immediately have a steel mill to replace it to grind flour." Other farmers also took out many waste stone rollers and broken millstones. After a whole night of preparation, the first day of construction—the morning of March 23rd—saw the departure of the material-delivery army of eleven agricultural production teams. Driving ox carts, pushing hand carts, carrying, and shouldering, the mighty force marched towards the construction site in the drizzle and mud, full of joy and cheers along the way. Song Xuewen, a 44-year-old woman, had bound feet and had difficulty walking. Today, she insisted on carrying two pieces of material, slipping countless times. The production team leader advised her to carry one less, but she refused. Ma Jialan, a newly married girl, came back to see her mother and happened to encounter this, so she immediately came out to deliver materials. She said, "How can I not participate when my mother's family has such a once-in-a-century event!"
    The construction workers were even more enthusiastic. At that time, the weather was still quite cold, and there was a lot of ice in the ditch. The cooperative members jumped into the water without hesitation to dredge the canal bed and build the station foundation. As soon as they got into the water, people were stunned by the prickling cold. Someone shouted "What hot water!" Everyone responded, "What hot water," "What hot water," as if it really was hot water, and they worked even harder. When the construction site needed three large trees, but could not find male labor to dig the trees, Women's Federation Director Song Guizhen silently led six women to the site and unexpectedly felled them in four hours. The workers of the Jinghai City Iron Factory and the Wood Industry Cooperative, who were responsible for manufacturing the water turbine, as well as blacksmiths and carpenters from this township and other counties who came to observe, worked tirelessly for three days and three nights to rush out this important component for the construction site in time. By the fifth day of the station's construction, March 27th, all the projects of a 21-horsepower hydroelectric power station: the station foundation, the turbine room, the tail water room, and the installation of generators and water turbines, were completed on schedule. Afterwards, three days were spent on canal sorting and other preparatory work.
    On April 1st, as the red sun set and night fell, the cylindrical gate of the station was slowly opened, sending out the first current. On this ancient east bank of the Grand Canal, a flower that never sleeps bloomed, and the light for which all the people of Chenguantun fought arduously had truly arrived.
    The construction of this small hydroelectric power station in Chenguantun at such an astonishing speed has had a great impact on the rural areas of various counties in the Tianjin area. In particular, the fact that agricultural cooperatives relied on their own strength rather than relying on the state to quickly build small hydroelectric power stations encouraged the hearts of all farmers.
    Not only that, Chenguantun also provided comprehensive and directional experience for people. The cost of this small power station is very cheap and is completely permissible under today's agricultural cooperative conditions. Its total investment, including the purchase of a generator converted from an electric motor, a steel mill, a set of water turbines, some lead wire nails, as well as the wood and stone contributed by the cooperative members at a discounted price, only totaled 2,256 yuan. Averaged among the 3,785 people in the village, each person only spent 60 cents. This power station did not use a single steel bar, a single bag of cement, little iron, and little brick. All the components of the water turbine, except for the main shaft and three other places, were made of wood. The intake wall was made of red clay, and the surface of the wall and the four walls of the turbine room were sandwiched with old wooden boards, bamboo strips, and reed mats. The foundation of the entire station, which bears all the pressure and impact, is the stone roller that has been in use for 75 years and has completed its historical mission. Everything is simple, economical, and locally sourced, which are its characteristics; however, the quality of the project is done very carefully. According to the assessment, it can be guaranteed for at least three years.
    Technology is still a mysterious thing for today's rural areas. To build hydroelectric power stations everywhere, who should rely on to master the technology? Relying on the central government to send down large numbers of experts is obviously impossible. Chenguantun also provided a new approach: relying on local farmers, blacksmiths, carpenters, masons, leaders at all levels, and technical talents who can be found as much as possible. They also invited the station master and technicians of the Luozigou Township Power Station in Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture, Jilin Province, who had built a station earlier, to guide them. For many important technical issues, the local people consulted them on the one hand, and explored on their own on the other hand, learning while doing. Now, some leading cadres of the prefectural committee, county committee, and township committee have initially mastered the technology of building stations. Farmers and craftsmen have learned even more. For example, Zhou Jiqing, a technician from the iron factory in the county town, and Xu Zhonghe, a technician from the wood industry cooperative, had never even seen a power station before. Not long ago, they went to Yanbian to visit and made a model on the spot, and also asked for some reference materials. After returning, the two cooperated and tried to make the first set of water turbines in February, but there were only two places where they did not fit together and had to be reworked. This time, the second set made for Chenguantun was installed very smoothly. It turned as soon as the water was released, and generated electricity immediately. Their progress is amazing. Farmers have also basically mastered the civil engineering techniques such as making station foundations and building turbine rooms. Now, from bottom to top, from the masses to the cadres, their minds have begun to be liberated. They have begun to feel that technology is not so mysterious and elusive. As long as they have the determination, perseverance, and ambition to delve into it, they can master it and control it.

    五天建成水电站
    本报记者　尹崇敬
    3月23日，在运河东岸，陈官屯村的街道上，出现了一张富有诗情画意的大字报：
    五天后的今天，我们建成水电站。
    五天后的今天，电站就给我们铡草磨面；
    五天后的今天，电灯把夜晚照得像白天；
    五天后的今天，妇女们就在电灯底下做针线；
    五天后的今天，我们就用无线电收听社会主义建设的好消息，收听政府对我们的指点。
    五天后的今天啊，为了迎接你，我们要拼命地干！
    陈官屯是河北静海县的一个普通村庄。去年冬天，农民们刚刚挖成一条干渠，把运河水引进来灌溉田亩。今春，县委考虑到农民在实现水利化以后的要求，确定利用这条渠道，建设一座小型水力发电站。22日半夜十二点钟，县委书记给这里的乡委书记打来了长途电话，说县委已经确定在陈官屯建站，要求五天建成，“你们有没有困难？”乡委书记一听，简直乐得合不拢嘴，连夜通知农业社的各生产队开会发动群众。接着全村都轰动起来了。
    县委根据目前农村对于电的要求很迫切，而经济条件又有限制，因而提出了一个明确的建站要求：花钱尽可能少，发电尽可能快。党的号召立刻变成了农民的行动，大家当时就开展起“投料”活动，争先把自己家里的旧木板、旧房檩、破桌、破柜拿出来作为建站投资。社务委员郝兰祥亲自动手带领人扒掉自家的院墙，取出很多石料来。社员魏国栋家的三尺八寸直径的大石碾设在村头已经七十五年了，这次决定投出来。他说：“石碾辛苦一辈子，任务完成了，把它拿去建电站，马上就有钢磨代替它磨面。”别的农民也纷纷把许许多多的废石磙、破磨盘拿了出来。经过了一个通夜的酝酿，建站第一天——23日清晨，十一个农业生产队的送料大军出动了。赶牛车的、推手车的、抬的、挑的浩浩荡荡，冒着小雨，踏着泥泞，齐向工地进发，一路上兴高采烈欢声四起。四十四岁的妇女宋学文曾经缠过脚，走路很不得劲。她今天一定要扛着两根料，也不知滑了多少跤。生产队长劝她少扛一根，她怎么也不依。出嫁不久的姑娘马家兰，回来看娘正好遇上，也立刻出来送料。她说：“娘家出了这样百年不遇的大事，我怎能不参加！”
    施工的人们更是热情高涨。当时天气还相当冷，沟里还有不少冰凌。社员们毫不犹豫地跳下水去疏浚渠床、砌造站基。刚一下水，人们都被刺得楞了一下，不知是谁叫了一声“好热水啊”！大家都响应起来：“好热水”、“好热水”，似乎真的下了热水似的，越干越起劲。当工地需要三棵大树使用的时候，找不着男劳动力去刨树，妇联主任宋桂珍不声不响地带着六个妇女前去，出人意外地在四个小时之内，就把它们放倒了。负责制造水轮机的静海城内铁工厂和木业社的工人，以及本乡和外县前来观摩的铁匠、木匠们，三天三夜，息人不息工具，为工地及时地赶制成了这套重要的机件。到建站的第五天，3月27日，一座二十一马力的水电站的各项工程：站基、水轮室、尾水室以及发电机、水轮机的安装等全部按期完成了。以后又做了三天渠道整理以及其他一些准备工作。
    4月1日，当红日西沉夜幕降临的时候，站上的圆筒闸徐徐启放，发出了第一股电流。这个古老运河东岸的原野上，一朵不夜之花怒放了，陈官屯全村人民为之奋战的光明，真的来到了。
    陈官屯这座小型水力发电站以如此惊人的速度建成，在天津专区各县农村发生了极大的影响。特别是农业社依靠自己的力量而不是依赖国家，很快地建设起小型水电站来，这件事情，振奋着所有农民的心。
    不仅如此。陈官屯还给人们创造了全面的方向性的经验。这个小电站的造价是十分便宜的，是今天农业社的条件完全许可的。它的全部投资，包括购买一只用电动机改装的发电机、一只钢磨、一套水轮机、一些铅丝铁钉、以及社员投资的木料、石料都折价在内，总共只有二千二百五十六元。以全村三千七百八十五个人平均，每人只花六角钱。这个电站，没用一根钢筋，没用一袋水泥，很少用铁，也很少用砖。全部水轮机的构件除主轴等三处外，都是木制的。进水墙是用红粘土打的，墙的表面和水轮室的四壁分别用旧木板、竹笆和苇席夹起。承受全部压力和冲劲的全站基础，就是那盘使用了七十五年已经完成历史任务的石碾。一切因陋就简、就地取材，是它的特点；但是工程质量做得很认真，据鉴定至少可以保用三年。
    技术，对于今天的农村还是一件神秘的事情。要到处兴建水电站，依靠谁来主宰技术呢？依靠中央派大批大批的专家下来显然是不可能的。陈官屯也提供了一条新的途径：依靠当地的农民、铁匠、木匠、瓦匠、各级领导干部和尽可能找到的技术人材。他们还请到了吉林省延边朝鲜族自治州先行建站的罗子沟乡发电站站长、技术员前来指导。许多重要技术问题，当地的人们一面向他们请教，一面也自己摸索，一边做一边学。现在，地委、县委、乡委都有一些领导干部初步掌握建站的技术了。农民、工匠们学会的东西更多。如县城里的铁工厂技工周吉庆、木业社技工徐忠和过去连看也没看过什么发电站，不久前，他们到延边参观，当场做了一个模型，又要回一些参考材料。回来以后，两人合作，2月间试作第一套水轮机，只有两处装不拢返了工。这次又为陈官屯制的第二套，安装非常顺利，一放水就转，一转马上发电。他们进步之快十分惊人。农民们对于做站基、建水轮室等土木技术也已基本掌握。现在由下到上，由群众到干部，思想开始解放了，他们开始感到，技术并不是那末神秘和不可捉摸，只要有决心、有毅力、有志气钻进去，就可以掌握它，驾驭它。
