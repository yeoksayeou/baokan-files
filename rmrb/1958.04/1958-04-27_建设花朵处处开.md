Construction Flowers Blooming Everywhere
Baogang Coking Plant Starts Construction

Baogang Coking Plant, one of China's larger coking chemical plants, officially started construction on the 26th. Ulanhu, First Secretary of the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, pushed a small cart, pouring the first load of concrete for the foundation of the coking workshop.

This plant is one of the main plants of the Baotou Iron and Steel Complex, with five large workshops including coal preparation, coking, and chemical product recovery. Part of the plant, including two coke ovens, will be put into production in July next year, ensuring that Baogang's No. 1 blast furnace produces iron on time. After the completion of this plant, in addition to producing a large amount of coke and gas for ironmaking, steelmaking, and rolling production systems, it will also produce more than ten important chemical products such as ammonium sulfate and coal tar, which will be used as raw materials for chemical fertilizers, building oil materials, medicine, dyes, plastics and other industries.

Before the official commencement of the project, the foundation works of the two huge coke ovens and coal storage towers and other major projects have already started, and the railway has been built to the plant. On the plant site covering about one square kilometer, a busy construction scene is now emerging.

Bengbu Establishes Textile Factory

The third textile factory in Anhui started construction in Bengbu on the 25th. The first phase of the factory includes more than 56,000 spindles and more than 1,000 looms. According to the plan, the first phase of the project will be completed and put into production in March next year.

The preparation work for this factory started on March 15. In just one month, they carried out a series of preparatory works before construction, such as site survey, technical design, and supply of building materials. While the factory is under construction, the training of production technicians is also actively underway, and the first batch of more than 100 students has been sent to Anhui Textile Factory No. 1 and Bengbu Dyeing and Weaving Factory for study.
Wugang Coking Oven Body Completed

The furnace body masonry project of the first coke oven of Wuhan Iron and Steel Complex has been completed on the 26th. After inspection, the quality of the masonry is good.

This coke oven will supply coke and gas for Wugang's No. 1 blast furnace to produce iron ahead of schedule. According to the conventional construction of coke ovens in the past, all refractory bricks must be prepared before the furnace body can be built. In order to speed up the construction, the builders broke this convention. They took special measures to carry out pre-installation in advance, and successively compressed the construction period five times during the construction process, shortening it from the original plan of ninety days to fifty-nine days.

Chongqing Iron and Steel Company Expansion

The expansion project of Chongqing Iron and Steel Company officially started. After the completion of the overall expansion of this company, it will become an important medium-sized iron and steel complex in the Southwest region.

Now, near this factory, thousands of construction workers are excavating the foundation of the factory buildings for ironmaking furnaces, coke ovens, and machine repair workshops. A large number of construction personnel are still gathering, and a large-scale construction climax will soon be formed.

Expanding Chongqing Iron and Steel Company is one of the key projects of the Southwest region's second five-year plan. After the expansion of this factory, in addition to producing and supplying a large amount of steel, steel plates, and other various construction steel to the Southwest region, it will also become a base for cultivating talents in black metallurgy construction in the Southwest region. This expansion plan will thoroughly transform all existing equipment, increase ironmaking, steelmaking, and primary rolling equipment, so that the main products, pig iron, steel, and steel can be rapidly improved.

    建设花朵处处开
    包钢焦化厂动工
    我国目前较大的焦炭化学工厂之一——包钢焦炭化学工厂，26日正式开工兴建。中共内蒙古自治区委员会第一书记乌兰夫推起小斗车，为炼焦车间的基础工程浇灌了第一车混凝土。
    这个工厂是包头钢铁联合企业主体工厂中的一个，共有备煤、炼焦、化学产品回收等五个大型车间。包括两座焦炉的部分工厂明年7月即可投入生产，保证包钢第一号高炉按时出铁。这个工厂建成后，除生产大量焦炭、煤气，供炼铁、炼钢、轧钢等生产系统使用外，还将生产硫氨、焦油等十多种重要的化学产品，供化学肥料、建筑用油料以及医药、染料、塑料等工业作原料。
    这项工程正式开工以前，两座巨大的焦炉和贮煤塔等主要项目的基础工程就已经动工，铁路已经修到了厂内。在占地约一平方公里的厂址上，现在出现一片繁忙的施工景象。
    蚌埠建立纺织厂
    安徽第三纺织厂25日在蚌埠动工兴建。这个厂的第一期工程包括五万六千多个纱锭和一千多台织布机。按照计划，第一期工程在明年3月份即可建成投入生产。
    这个厂的筹备工作是从3月15日开始的。在短短一个月的时间里，他们进行了厂址勘测、技术设计、建筑器材供应等施工前的一系列准备工作。这个厂在开工兴建的同时，生产技术工人的培训工作也在积极进行，第一批一百多名学员已派往安纺一厂和蚌埠染织厂进行学习。武钢炼焦炉炉身砌成
    武汉钢铁联合企业第一座炼焦炉的炉身砌筑工程，已在26日完成。经过检查，砌筑的质量良好。
    这座炼焦炉将为武钢一号高炉提前出铁供应焦炭和煤气。按照过去炼焦炉的施工常规，必须备齐全部耐火砖才能砌筑炉身。建设者们为了加速建设，打破了这个常规。他们采取特别措施，提前进行预安装，在施工过程中接连把工期压缩了五次，由原订计划的九十天缩短为五十九天砌完。
    重庆钢铁公司扩建
    重庆钢铁公司的扩建工程正式开工。这个公司全面扩建完工后，将成为西南地区一个重要的中型钢铁联合企业。
    现在，在这个工厂附近，几千名建筑工人正在开挖炼铁炉、炼焦炉、机修工场的厂房基础。大批的施工人员还在不断集结，一个大规模的施工高潮很快就要形成。
    扩建重庆钢铁公司是西南地区第二个五年计划的重点工程之一。这个工厂扩建完成后，除了大量生产和供应西南地区钢、钢板和其他各种建设钢材外，还将成为西南地区培养黑色冶金建设人才的基地。这次扩建计划将原有全部设备加以彻底改造，增加炼铁、炼钢、初轧设备等，使主要产品生铁、钢、钢材能够迅速提高。　（新华社）
