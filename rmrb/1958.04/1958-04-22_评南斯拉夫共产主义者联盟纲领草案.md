In March, Yugoslavia published the draft program of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, which is to be discussed at the Seventh Congress opening on April 22. The draft is currently under discussion. According to Yugoslav newspapers, Yugoslav communists have raised many opinions and suggestions during the discussion to assist in the final drafting of the program.

The discussion and adoption of a program is a major event in the life of any Communist Party. It is an internal matter, but it naturally attracts the attention of communists in other countries. The draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia has attracted attention for another reason: the issues it addresses go far beyond Yugoslavia's internal problems. The preamble of the program states:

"The program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is an analysis of the contradictions of the modern world. It defines the views and positions of Yugoslav communists on general problems of social, economic, and political relations in the world.

"The program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia expresses the fundamental principles on certain key issues in the contemporary international workers' movement and the development of world socialism."

Upon reading the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, one can see that it includes a series of common Marxist-Leninist principles and many correct summaries. However, regrettably, there are also many points that obviously contradict Marxist-Leninist theory and practice, as well as the theory and practice of the world communist movement. This is particularly evident in the following issues: the problem of modern international development, the problem of the two world systems, the problem of the experience of socialist construction in various countries, especially the Soviet Union, the problem of socialist countries, the problem of proletarian internationalism and the mutual relations between socialist countries and communist parties, and the problem of understanding modern revisionism and dogmatism.

It must be mentioned that the draft program's assessment of the modern international situation, the development of the world socialist system, and the development of the international workers' and communist movements, on a series of extremely important issues, is at odds with the assessments made in the Declaration and Peace Declaration adopted at the November 1957 meeting of representatives of communist and workers' parties.

The drafters of the draft program point out that "in the current stage of the struggle for socialism, there are certain differences in views on some theoretical and practical issues." Therefore, these are not local issues but fundamental issues in socialist theory and practice, on which the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia presents special propositions.

At this time, Yugoslavia is discussing the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, and we would like to offer some comradely opinions on some fundamental issues, hoping to be welcomed and discussed by the drafters of the draft program.

In the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the issue of modern capitalism and the path to socialism occupies a prominent position. The central idea here is that while revolutionary socialist transformation is taking place, there is also a process of evolutionary transformation from capitalism to socialism. In an attempt to prove that a socialist society can also be produced through an evolutionary path, a series of anti-scientific, non-Marxist, and non-Leninist views have emerged regarding the unique phenomena and processes of modern capitalism.

In the draft program, correct views on monopoly capitalism are mixed with erroneous views, and this is especially the case when discussing the state monopoly capitalism that dominates the present-day developed capitalist countries. In this document, the political factors in the development of state monopoly capitalism are prominently highlighted, while the analysis of the inherent economic laws of capitalism is neglected.

The drafters of the draft program, on the one hand, correctly point out the increasing role of the state in capitalist economies, but on the other hand, incorrectly explain the relationship between monopoly capital and the state. The draft program states that the state "increasingly supervises capital, partially restricts the rights of private management of capitalist property, and deprives private capital owners of certain independent functions in the economy and society.

"The process of linking monopoly capitalists with state management continues. Monopoly capitalists in certain sectors they control are increasingly losing their original fully independent role, and certain functions of monopoly capital are increasingly transferred to the state."

The idea that state intervention will reduce the economic power base of monopoly capital is not in line with the actual situation in capitalist society. Has the nationalization of certain enterprises and certain industries in Britain, Italy, and France reduced the economic power base of the entire monopoly capital? Absolutely not! Such intervention frees monopoly capital from backward and loss-making industrial sectors (such as the coal industry). This intervention transfers difficulties to taxpayers and allows capitalists to invest their capital in more profitable sectors. This intervention allows backward industrial sectors to replace their equipment with national budget funds, thus enabling monopoly capital to obtain cheap coal, electricity, etc., and all monopoly capital benefits from this.

Has the supervision and regulation of capitalist countries limited the ownership and control of property by capitalists? Has it reduced the degree of exploitation of wage laborers? Of course not! If we raise Lenin's question: who supervises whom, that is, which class is the supervisor and which class is the supervised, it is clear that the supervision and regulation of capitalist countries are in the interests of monopoly capital and against the working class.

The growth of state monopoly capitalism means the further strengthening of monopoly capital, the further concentration of economic and political power into the hands of monopoly capital, the use of the state for their selfish purposes, and the harm to the interests of the working people.

From the following argument of the drafters of the draft program, one can see how far they have deviated from Leninism: "The more functions transferred from private capital to the state (in this case, various methods are often used to limit the power of private capital), the greater the pressure of new, objectively socialist factors on the capitalist mode of production."

For the drafters of the program, the state has become a super-class institution that stands opposed to the two hostile classes (the bourgeoisie and the proletariat) in capitalist society. The draft program states: "State institutions, in order to gain their independent functions, often place themselves above society and increasingly show a tendency to limit the role of private capital and the role of the working class."

It is undoubtedly correct to say that the capitalist state is launching an attack on the political rights and immediate economic interests of the proletariat. However, can one point to any significant facts to show that the bourgeois state is against the interests of the bourgeoisie and against monopoly capital? No, it is not possible! The capitalist state can and does oppose small and medium capitalists to please the big capitalists, it can limit individual joint-stock companies, but it will always necessarily serve the common interests of the bourgeoisie, the interests of monopoly capital.

Lenin correctly pointed out, and life has repeatedly proven, that "the process of further monopolization and further nationalization of production must necessarily be accompanied by the strengthening of the exploitation of the laboring masses, the strengthening of oppression, the increase in difficulties for the oppressed, the strengthening of reactionary forces and military dictatorship, and at the same time must necessarily lead to the extraordinary increase in profits for the big capitalists at the expense of all other strata of the population, the enslavement of the laboring masses for decades to pay tribute to the capitalists in the tens of billions of interest on debts." ("Lenin Collected Works," Vol. 24, pp. 276-277)

Under the current conditions, when the socialist world system has achieved great victories that inspire the people of capitalist countries, the monopoly bourgeoisie is also forced to make certain concessions of a social and economic nature. However, it is absolutely impossible, as in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, to regard the bourgeois state as a super-class, a just "regulator" of labor relations and property relations.

The following argument in the draft program also absolutely cannot reflect reality: "The greater the balance in the political struggle between the bourgeoisie and the working class for their influence and position in the state capitalist system, the more independent the functions of the bureaucrats will be in their efforts to preserve state capitalist relations." Undoubtedly, the working class has grown stronger in many capitalist countries, but the state machine is still in the hands of the imperialist bourgeoisie, executing their will. The argument about the "independence" of the state under modern capitalist conditions obscures the class nature of the capitalist state and diverts the attention of the proletariat from its historical task of seizing power through revolution.

The modern bourgeois state is a class institution of the capitalists used to maintain the entire capitalist production conditions. It is essentially the state of the capitalists, the sum of the capitalists. The more productive forces it controls, the more citizens it exploits. In this case, the worker remains a wage laborer, a proletarian, and the capitalist remains a capitalist, an exploiter. State monopoly capitalist ownership cannot solve the conflict between productive forces and production relations, but only contains the possibility of solving this conflict.

In capitalist society, the nationalization of individual economic sectors, no matter how important, cannot directly lead to socialism. This has been proven by facts. For example, the British Labour Party government implemented the nationalization of certain economic sectors, but it did not lead the country to socialism. To achieve socialism, the working class must establish its political rule, seize the basic means of production, and carry out the socialist transformation of society. Only in a country where this has been achieved will there be socialism. Marxist-Leninists have always believed that state capitalism will not transition to socialism on its own, but only through a socialist revolution can it transition to socialism. State monopoly capitalism only strengthens the material prerequisites for building socialism.

The draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia contains correct points but also many points that contradict the above points. These points lead to the conclusion that as long as the "socialist phenomena," "factors," and "tendencies" in capitalism simply increase and accumulate in quantity, they can transition to socialism, that is, socialism can spontaneously grow within the capitalist system. For example, the drafters of the draft program, on the one hand, point out that "only the conscious political activity of the working class" can achieve the transition to socialism, but on the other hand, they reduce this activity to merely "struggling for a leading role in the seizure of power," that is, struggling for a leading role within the existing bourgeois power. They say, "socialist tendencies infiltrate the state capitalist system," and they also say, "the special forms of state capitalist relations can be the last effort of capitalism to save itself, or the first step towards socialism, or both at the same time," and so on.

It is not possible to agree with such a presentation of the issue of transitioning from capitalism to socialism. Marxism-Leninism holds that "capitalism itself creates its own gravediggers, creates the elements of the new system, but these individual elements, if not through a 'mutation,' cannot change the general actual situation, cannot touch the rule of capital." ("Lenin Collected Works," Vol. 16, p. 318)

The drafters of the draft program believe that "the degree of development of so-called economic democracy also depends on" whether the struggle for the nationalization of industry and the struggle for workers' participation in the management of nationalized and private production is successful. However, workers' participation in the "management" of capitalist production, if divorced from mass political struggle, does not have a revolutionary socialist character. If not connected with the political struggle of the masses, such a slogan is nothing more than a call for workers to organize themselves into the capitalist system, a call to abandon revolutionary struggle.

The draft program also pays special attention to the issue of the social development path of countries that have freed themselves from colonial oppression; the draft program, in discussing this complex issue, does not fully consider the characteristics of these countries and the influence of internal and external factors on their development.

The drafters of the draft program regard the bourgeois state as a super-class thing, which contradicts Lenin's theory of breaking the old bourgeois state machine and building a new proletarian state machine. In their view, the whole problem is simply reduced to the working class and capitalists struggling for control of a state machine. The draft program states that the bourgeoisie "strives, above all, through decisive supervision of the state power apparatus, to maintain as many positions and basic social privileges as possible. ... On the contrary, the working class consciously and spontaneously ... constantly exerts pressure to eliminate or limit the various privileges of the bourgeoisie and to expand and accelerate the socialization of economic functions, to struggle for a decisive role in the management of these functions and to seize state power." The draft program also points out that the working class's struggle for a "leading role in the seizure of power," to "transform the state machine into a servant of society," can achieve the transition from state capitalism to socialism.

Historical experience tells us, and the analysis of modern social development from a Marxist-Leninist standpoint also shows that in any case, the necessary precondition for the transition to socialism is: the proletariat, under the leadership of its vanguard, seizes state power, establishes the political rule of the working class, establishes some form of proletarian dictatorship, and, relying on this power, transforms the means of production into the property of the whole people, the state, and carries out socialist transformation.

The Communist Party believes that the socialist transformation of society can, depending on the specific conditions of each country, either through the path of violence or the path of peace. However, even the path of peace is a path of revolutionary development, a form of revolution. Some Yugoslav theorists do not mention the revolutionary path of violence or peace, but mention the path of revolution and "evolution." The second path is not a revolutionary path.

The struggle of the working class to transform society according to socialist principles must be under the leadership of a Marxist-Leninist party to be victorious. However, the drafters of the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia actually believe that it is possible to achieve socialism through a non-revolutionary evolutionary path, and as a result, they naturally deny the leadership role of the party. Not only that, but they also believe that the leadership role of the Communist Party in the workers' revolutionary movement is a "monopoly." They say: "The idea that the Communist Party can monopolize every form of the socialist movement and that socialism can only be realized in these parties and only through these parties is incorrect in theory and very harmful in practice."

The drafters of the draft program even believe that in some countries, the working class can seize power and achieve socialism without its own party. They write: "In countries where there is no typical working-class party, such as the United States, the greatest possibility is to organize the working masses in trade unions, and through trade unions, to increasingly draw them into the process of conscious growth of socialist forces, into the struggle of the working class to strengthen its social influence and struggle for a leading role in the power system." Is there any factual basis for such a conclusion? Can trade unions, especially the American trade unions that currently stand on the position of defending the capitalist system, make the United States achieve socialism? Such an assumption would probably surprise even the leaders of the American trade unions.

In the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, although the merits of the communist and workers' parties of various countries are mentioned, the development of the international communist movement in the current stage, the strengthening of the unity and consistency of its ranks, are almost not mentioned. The focus is shifted to the unjustified criticism of certain shortcomings in the activities of the communist parties of various countries. It is said that "bureaucratism, dogmatism, opportunism disguised as leftist phrases, sectarianism, excessive reliance on force, as well as the monopoly of thought and politics," are inherent in these parties. Needless to say, such a statement does not reflect the actual situation and has nothing in common with the principled, comradely criticism that can be conducted between brother parties for the sake of strengthening ideological-political unity.

The world communist movement is flourishing. The meeting of representatives of brother communist and workers' parties in Moscow last autumn extremely powerfully demonstrated the unity and great achievements of this movement.

The serious flaw in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia in explaining international relations is that it ignores the fact of world-historical significance that the world has split into two systems—the socialist system and the capitalist system. Indeed, in this document, one can see the phrase "socialist world," but these words do not refer to the actually existing socialist world system, but to something very vague and unclear. The draft program points out that Yugoslavia, as a socialist country, "is part of the socialist world, that is, the socialist and progressive forces of modern humanity."

The draft program does not clearly reveal the basic contradiction in the development of the modern world—the contradiction and struggle between the constantly growing and strengthening world socialist system, supported by the working class of capitalist countries and the masses of the economically underdeveloped countries, and the outdated but still powerful capitalist system. The issue of the existence of two world systems is essentially replaced by the issue of two military-political blocs. Although the draft program also points out that the views of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia on the social, economic, and political essence and role of the existing various blocs are different, when specifically analyzing the causes of international tensions, it does not treat the two blocs separately.

Everyone knows that the source of the war threat lies in the nature of imperialism. However, the drafters of the draft program believe that the fundamental cause of international tensions is not the aggressive policy of imperialist countries, but the existence of two military-political blocs. This is obviously contrary to the Marxist-Leninist principle of the causes of international tensions. The Peace Declaration states, "Where does the threat to the cause of peace, the threat to the security of the peoples of all countries, come from? Those who are eager for war and fantasize about war are the monopoly capitalist groups that have made huge profits in the two world wars and in the current arms race." It goes on to say, "Some ruling groups of capitalist countries, under the pressure of monopoly capital, especially American monopoly capital, reject proposals for disarmament, the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and other measures to prevent new wars." The Peace Declaration also points out, "In all socialist countries, there are no classes and social strata eager for war. Here, the workers and peasants are in power, who have suffered the most in all past wars. Would they want a new war? The goal of the communists is to build a society that ensures the well-being of all the people, the prosperity of all peoples, and eternal peace among nations. Socialist countries need lasting peace to build such a society."

It can be seen that the Peace Declaration, which was formulated and voted on by representatives including those of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, has already pointed out that the danger to the cause of peace originates from capitalist monopoly capital, and neither the Communist Party nor the socialist countries have the motive to launch wars and carry out military aggression against other countries. However, the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia believes that the source of the danger of war is the existence of blocs, and it confuses the peaceful foreign policy of socialist countries with the aggressive policy of the imperialist ruling groups.

It is extremely surprising that the draft program does not mention at all the deepening of the imbalance in capitalist development that leads to the sharpening of contradictions between imperialist countries, nor does it mention the revival of German militarism, the aggressive policy of the United States, and the militarization of the economies of the major capitalist countries. It seems that the program of the Communist Party cannot avoid these issues, especially because the task of opposing imperialist aggression has been particularly strongly indicated in the Declaration adopted by the representatives of the socialist countries and the communist and workers' parties, which is supported by the entire international communist movement. The Declaration states, "The imperialist aggression group of the United States, seeking to rule most countries in the world through the so-called 'policy of strength,' and attempting to hinder the progress of humanity according to the laws of social development. They use the pretext of 'anti-communism' to attempt to rule more and more countries, to eliminate democratic freedoms, to threaten the national independence of developed capitalist countries, to impose new forms of colonial shackles on the already liberated peoples, and to constantly and unceasingly carry out hostile subversive activities against socialist countries. The policy of some aggressive groups in the United States is to gather all reactionary forces in the capitalist world around them. Thus, these groups become the center of world reactionary forces, the most vicious enemy of the masses of the people."

However, all this is ignored by the drafters of the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. After reading the draft program, one gets the impression that the criticism is objectively directed against the socialist countries and workers' parties; under the pretext of criticizing blocs, it is actually criticizing the unity of the Communist Party and the socialist camp.

Everyone knows that imperialism, and only imperialism, implements the policy of strength, but the drafters of the program insist that socialist countries also implement this policy. The drafters of the program write, "The reason why international relations cannot achieve relatively long-term and stable stability is primarily that the sharpening of current contradictions forces these or those great powers, this or that bloc, to impose a policy of strength on international relations."

The draft program groundlessly puts all the reasonable accusations made by the people who love peace against the imperialist policies of the Western ruling groups also on the socialist countries that consistently pursue a peaceful foreign policy, and indiscriminately uses the word "hegemony" to evaluate both the policies of imperialist countries and the policies of socialist countries.

For example, is the foreign policy of the Soviet Union called a "policy of strength"? Of course not! The policy of strength is: preparing for a new war to establish one's own world hegemony, forcing other countries to accept one's will, attempting to exploit the world, and obtain monopoly super-profits. The Soviet Union implements a peaceful foreign policy, with no aggressive or plundering purposes. The Soviet Union has no economic motives driving it to seize the land of other countries and plunder other peoples.

The policy of strength is derived from the worldview of the monopoly bourgeoisie, which believes that "strength" can stop or even eliminate the action of the objective laws of historical development. This is a sign of the belief of a dying class. The Soviet Union bases its policy on Marxism-Leninism, which is incompatible with bourgeois idealist "violence theory," and it is based on the objective laws of history, according to which an outdated social system must be replaced by a more advanced social system.

The draft program contains some groundless statements about the so-called division of "spheres of interest" and "spheres of influence," claiming that the first socialist country in the world also participated in this division, which has caused resolute protests and opposition. The draft program states: "The method of dividing spheres of influence and other similar political forms has already appeared at the Tehran, Yalta, and Potsdam conferences of the Allied leaders, and continues to exist in the post-war period." In another place in the draft program, it states: "The policy of dividing spheres of influence has poisoned (and continues to poison) international relations. The peoples of Germany, Korea, and Vietnam live in countries divided by different social systems and artificial borders, and they are potential sources of open conflict."

Everyone knows that at Tehran, Yalta, or Potsdam, the Soviet Union did not seek any "spheres of interest" and "spheres of influence." The Soviet Union fought at these conferences for the national independence and state sovereignty of the countries of Central and Southeastern Europe, not for its own spheres of influence. This is one of the conditions for the peoples of the countries that have broken free from the fascist yoke to be able to choose the path of socialist development.

As for the division of the German, Korean, and Vietnamese peoples, it was caused by the imperialists, who opposed the peaceful unification of any of these countries. According to official documents, to this day, on these issues, for example, on the German issue, the positions of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia are not divided. We would like to remind you that in the joint statement issued by the governments of the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia during the visit of Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito to the Soviet Union, it was pointed out: "... The two governments believe that today, when two sovereign states have formed on the territory of post-war Germany, the unification of Germany must be achieved through negotiations between the Federal Republic of Germany and the German Democratic Republic. They also believe that the other countries, especially the great powers, should make efforts in this regard for the benefit of the German people and for the common benefit."

In the areas of the arms race, the policy of "maintaining the balance through armaments," and the use of nuclear energy, the drafters of the draft program again criticize both sides, although everyone knows that the socialist camp has no responsibility for the arms race. The member countries of this camp are doing everything in their power to stop the arms race. However, it is natural that socialist countries are also taking all necessary measures to ensure their own security. This has significant importance for ensuring the security of countries that are not part of the socialist camp.

It is noteworthy that the attacks on the foreign policy of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries in the draft program are in contradiction with the words of Yugoslav President Josip Broz Tito at a mass rally in Belgrade on June 28, 1956, after the Yugoslav government delegation returned from Moscow. He said at the time, "From the part of the Declaration concerning international issues, it can be seen that on many extremely important issues related to the consolidation of peace and international cooperation, the relations between countries and peoples, and the peaceful coexistence of countries with different social systems, our views are the same." Comrade Tito sincerely said, "The Soviet people love peace more than anything else, and the Soviet leaders also have this desire."

It cannot be considered that the new structure of international relations proposed in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is correct, as this draft program confuses the foreign policy of the socialist camp with the foreign policy of the imperialist camp.

The Soviet Union, in close cooperation with other socialist countries, stands shoulder to shoulder with all peace-loving peoples of the world to make every effort to prevent a new war. In recent times, the Soviet Union has proposed many constructive new initiatives and taken a series of diplomatic steps aimed at easing international tensions, stopping the arms race, and banning nuclear weapons. Recently, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union adopted a resolution on the unilateral cessation of nuclear and hydrogen weapon tests by the Soviet Union. The Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union called on the United States and Britain to follow the example of the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union's proposals have not yet received a positive response from the ruling groups of the United States and other Western countries, is this also the fault of the Soviet Union? The Western countries do not want to follow the example of the Soviet Union, do not want to stop testing nuclear and hydrogen weapons, is this also the fault of the Soviet Union? The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other countries of the socialist camp, aware of their historical mission, are steadfastly implementing a policy of maintaining peace and the security of the peoples of all countries.

The drafters of the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, when discussing the experience of socialist development in the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, acknowledge that this is "a valuable experience for international socialism." The draft program points out the historical role of the Soviet Union as the first socialist country that set an example of social progress for other countries. The draft program discusses the great achievements of the Soviet Union in building an industrial base and further developing socialist relations, which enabled the Soviet Union to cooperate with the other countries of the anti-Hitler alliance in the Second World War and defeat the fascist forces.

The drafters of the draft program indeed point out the achievements in industrialization, but they completely avoid discussing the experience of the Soviet Union in the extremely important and complex issue of socialist construction—leading hundreds of millions of peasant masses, individual and private small peasant economies, onto the path of socialist development. Is this not an issue facing all countries that have embarked on the path of socialist construction? Since the experience of socialist construction is being summarized, how can one not consider the richest experience of Soviet collective farm construction?

It should be said that the entire draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia gives an extremely biased and one-sided explanation of the historical path taken by the Soviet Union. The draft program does not give due explanation to the experience of socialist construction in the People's Republic of China and other people's democratic countries.

Everyone knows that the experience of the Soviet Union and other socialist countries completely confirms the correctness of the following points of Marxist-Leninist theory: the process of socialist revolution and socialist construction is based on certain major laws inherent in all countries that have embarked on the path of socialism. Unfortunately, the draft program does not pay attention to the universal laws of socialist development. On the contrary, the draft program focuses mainly on the past shortcomings and errors of the Soviet Union; these shortcomings and errors are referred to by the drafters of the program as a certain "bureaucratic-statist tendency," and the so-called "bureaucratic-statist tendency" is that someone wants to turn the state apparatus into the "master of society."

The drafters of the program, under the pretext of criticizing someone who tries to "defend personal cult in theory and thought," accuse Soviet communists of revising important principles of Marxism-Leninism, especially Marxism-Leninism on the theory of the state and law. They write: "The Marxist-Leninist theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat (that is, the theory of the struggle of the proletariat against the capitalist economic base and the establishment of the political and material conditions for the free development of socialist social relations) has become Stalin's theory of the state, that is, the state does not wither away, but must be increasingly strengthened in all aspects of social life, and in socialist construction, too much importance has been given to the state machine, and this importance will inevitably begin to hinder the development of socialist social and economic factors."

It can be completely said: all these statements distort the process of social life and theoretical thought development in the Soviet Union.

The statement that Stalin believed that the state would not wither away and that the state should be continuously strengthened in all aspects of social life is incorrect. Stalin's views on the state, on the dictatorship of the proletariat, reflect the views of Marxism-Leninism. Stalin, as a Marxist should, studied the socialist state in the process of development. He never believed that the form of the socialist state was permanent and that all the initial functions of the Soviet socialist state would be preserved forever. With the victory of socialism, the form and functions of the Soviet socialist state have greatly changed. When talking about these changes, Stalin said: "The function of domestic violence has disappeared and withered away because the system of exploitation has been abolished, the exploiters no longer exist, and there is no one left to suppress." ("Problems of Leninism," 11th edition, p. 645)

Stalin repeatedly said: in a communist society, there will be no state power, and the state will wither away at that time. Stalin's words are well known. At the 18th Congress of the CPSU, he once again explained: when the capitalist encirclement no longer exists and the danger of foreign military aggression is eliminated, the state will disappear; only when the capitalist encirclement still exists and the danger of foreign military aggression has not been eliminated, it is necessary to temporarily retain the state.

When the drafters of the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia talk about the state, as with many other issues, it is obviously illogical. The draft program correctly states: one should oppose the tendency of anarchists to underestimate the state, and the state is one of the most important and necessary levers for destroying the economic base of the capitalist system and laying the foundation for socialist construction. However, it should be pointed out that their acknowledgment of the important role of the socialist state and their opposition to the tendency of anarchists to underestimate state power seem to be just a way to leave an escape route, because they strongly propose the point of the withering away of the state, believing that this is today's direct and main task.

The drafters of the program regard the view that the state must still exist before the advent of communist society as a "revision of Marxism in a statist-utilitarian manner," and they say: "Therefore, after the consolidation of the power of the working class and all working people, the problem of the gradual withering away of the state becomes the fundamental and decisive problem of the socialist social system."

Since the drafters of the draft program accuse others of revising the Marxist-Leninist principles on the state issue, we must recount the views of the founders of scientific communism on the state and the dictatorship of the proletariat.

The acknowledgment that the state should exist before the victory of socialism develops into complete communism is a cornerstone of Marxism-Leninism. Lenin repeatedly said that for the complete withering away of the state, complete communism is needed.

Some revisionists in certain countries have recently, under the pretext of criticizing "Stalinism," spread distorted and false ideas about Lenin and Leninism's attitude towards the dictatorship of the proletariat. They almost describe Lenin as a liberal, an opponent of the dictatorship of the proletariat. However, everyone knows that it was Lenin who comprehensively formulated the theory of the class struggle in the transitional period from capitalism to socialism and the theory of the dictatorship of the proletariat.

Historical experience has confirmed Lenin's following points: in the transitional period from capitalism to socialism, class struggle has not stopped but has taken new forms. Everyone knows that the forms of resistance of the overthrown exploiting class are diverse: conspiracies, sabotage, anti-socialist propaganda and slander, influence on the petty bourgeoisie, and finally, armed attacks on the dictatorship of the proletariat. This resistance is carried out by both domestic remnants of the exploiting class and escaped capitalists and landlords, as well as international reactionaries.

The working class hopes to transition to socialism as peacefully and painlessly as possible. This is understandable because the sharpening of class struggle brings about great sacrifices, destruction of productive forces, economic difficulties, collapse, and the poverty and hardship of the laboring people. However, if the working class completely relies on the landlords and capitalists to peacefully hand over political power and the ownership of the means of production, if they do not suppress the resistance of the overthrown exploiting class, then they will have to abandon socialism.

Due to the victory of socialism in the Soviet Union, the formation of the world socialist system, and the strengthening of the world workers' movement and national liberation movement, there are now relatively good conditions to transition to socialism more peacefully and painlessly. The rich experience of socialist construction in China and other people's democratic countries vividly shows the significance of this new possibility of socialist development. However, this does not mean that in the transition to socialism, the enemy elements will not strengthen their resistance, and class struggle will not sharpen. One cannot ignore the international situation, one cannot forget that we live in an environment where the socialist and capitalist world systems coexist, and in a situation where international imperialism is waging extremely sharp struggles against the socialist camp. For example, the Hungarian events of 1956 remind us that even today, in countries that are transitioning from capitalism to socialism, if the dictatorship of the proletariat is weakened, there may be counter-revolutionary provocations and unrest. As long as there are remnants of the exploiting class, as long as they have a little hope of relying on the support of petty bourgeois elements, there will be a danger of strengthening counter-revolutionary activities, which will be encouraged and directly supported by international imperialism.

The drafters of the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, in their presentation of the issue of the withering away of the state, have not considered the experience of the development of various socialist countries and the nature of the current international situation, have underestimated the danger of imperialist aggression against socialist countries, and have underestimated the danger of class contradictions in the transitional period from capitalism to socialism.

The draft program lists many contradictions in social development during the transitional period, but it does not highlight the main contradiction, that is, the contradiction between the constantly growing socialist forces and the decaying capitalist forces. This main contradiction is obscured or even disappears in the draft program's verbose description of a pile of other contradictions.

In addition, the drafters of this document do not regard the struggle of the working class against the remnants of capitalism and the spontaneous forces of small private owners as the basic contradiction, but as they express it, they regard the issues of the forms and methods of managing economic and other social functions, the issues of democracy and the gradual limitation of "administrative centralized leadership," and so on, as the basic contradictions. They write: "Solving the contradictions of the transitional period from capitalism to socialism primarily means solving these problems, which can ensure the continuous progress of various forms of socialist construction." Even if we admit that all the problems mentioned in the draft program, whether we have mentioned them or not, have some significance, do they constitute the essence of the contradictions of the transitional period?

By the way, the drafters of the draft program write that administrative centralized leadership is a contradiction inherent in the transitional period, and ultimately in socialism itself, which is incorrect. Everyone knows that in a socialist society, management is based on the principle of democratic centralism, which, in various stages, shifts according to specific conditions and is embodied in various organizational forms. Any distortion of Lenin's principle of democratic centralism is absolutely not a contradiction inherent in socialism itself.

Dialectics teach that one should not confuse the basic contradictions in a phenomenon with non-basic contradictions. If this confusion is made in policy, it may undermine the unity of the laboring people, the alliance of the working class and the peasantry, and thus help the enemies of socialism.

Historical experience shows that in the transitional period from capitalism to socialism, when there are still remnants of the exploiting class and the spontaneous forces of small private owners, the issue of the withering away of the state cannot be raised as a practical issue.

Even after the exploiting class is eliminated, the state must still be preserved, although the function of suppressing the exploiting class has disappeared. Lenin wrote in "The State and Revolution": "One must understand that the dictatorship of a class is necessary not only for class society in general, not only for the proletariat that has overthrown the bourgeoisie, but also for the entire historical period of the transition from capitalism to 'classless society,' to communism, — only those who understand this can be said to have grasped the essence of Marx's state theory." ("Lenin Collected Works," Vol. 25, pp. 384-385)

Title: Why the State Cannot Immediately Disappear After the Exploitation Class is Eliminated

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 21st

The state cannot immediately disappear after the exploitation class is eliminated for several reasons:

Firstly, to defend against the conspiracies and military attacks of imperialists is necessary, because imperialists have not relaxed but are intensifying their sabotage work against socialist countries. Socialist countries advocate peaceful coexistence and competition between two opposing social and political systems. However, the imperialist aggression groups do not abandon their plots to use violence to restore the bourgeois-landlord system in socialist countries and eliminate the socialist system. If the state's extremely important function in defense is reduced or abolished, socialist countries will be defenseless against international imperialism.

Secondly, under socialism, there are still differences between the working class and the peasantry, the essential differences between mental and physical labor have not been eliminated, and consumer goods are not abundant. Distribution is carried out according to the principle of "to each according to his work." Therefore, it is necessary for society, for the state, to strictly control the amount of labor and consumption. Lenin wrote: "When society has realized the principle of 'from each according to his ability, to each according to his needs,' that is, when people have become so accustomed to observing the basic rules of public life, and their labor productivity has developed to such an extent that they voluntarily work to the best of their ability, then the state will completely disappear." ("Lenin Collected Works," Vol. 25, p. 440)

Thirdly, after the victory of the socialist revolution, national differences will long persist; national sovereignty will not only not disappear but, on the contrary, will be truly guaranteed and strengthened. However, everyone knows that national sovereignty is linked to the issue of borders. In observing the fate of the state, one cannot ignore the issue of demarcating borders. Leninism teaches that victorious socialism fully democratizes in all respects, so it cannot refuse to democratically demarcate borders. If there is no state, there will be no border issue. Lenin said: "The state 'disappears,' and the republics will have no more." ("Lenin Collected Works," Vol. 22, p. 309)

The drafters of the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia discussed strengthening the independence of the state while declaring the disappearance of the state as a practical task. If they were consistent, they should have raised the issue of eliminating borders. However, has any socialist country's issue of eliminating borders matured? Lenin is completely correct in linking the issue of the state's disappearance not only with the complete elimination of classes but also with the issue of the increasing closeness and unity of all nations.

Lenin said: "To eliminate national oppression, a basis is needed, namely socialist production, but on this basis, there must also be a state democratic organization, a democratic army, etc. ... On this basis, the actual elimination of all minor friction between nations, minor mistrust between nations, begins, and on this basis, nations quickly establish closeness and unity, which is completed with the disappearance of the state." ("Lenin Collected Works," Vol. 22, p. 311)

From this, it can be seen that, according to Lenin's view, the closeness and unity of nations do not begin with the disappearance of the state but are completed with the disappearance of the state.

Lenin's instructions are still of urgent significance today. Everyone knows that many countries have only achieved national independence when they embarked on the path of socialist development. Undoubtedly, in the future, only when socialism achieves more victories and capitalism is further weakened, will many countries gain national sovereignty. In this case, raising the issue of the state's disappearance is to cancel the extremely important issue of the struggle for national sovereignty and the guarantee of achieving national independence for the peoples of various countries who have been under the slavery of colonialists for generations.

It seems that the drafters of the program draft did not consider the fundamental premise of the state's disappearance. They may have based their views on the fact that some functions of the state are now disappearing, completely from a quantitative perspective, believing that the reduction in the quantity of state functions is the complete disappearance of the state.

However, it is incorrect to confuse the issue of the change and disappearance of some functions of the state with the complete disappearance of the whole state as a certain social and political phenomenon. The socialist state has not become outdated and cannot raise the issue of the state's rapid disappearance. The socialist state is a broad stage for the development of socialist democracy.

One should not think that the state's complete disappearance can be accelerated by some administrative measures, that is, through administrative orders. As mentioned earlier, the issue of the state's complete disappearance is the issue of the complete disappearance of classes and class differences, the issue of the further closeness and unity of nations.

Politics is the relationship between classes and nations. These relationships are also the scope of the state structure. One can change the names of state organs, transfer their functions to social organizations, but whether it is state organs or state functions, they will not cease to be political in substance.

Only in a completely communist society, that is, when classes disappear, the fundamental differences between mental and physical labor are eliminated, and nations further approach and unite, will social functions lose their political nature and become ordinary administrative functions for maintaining social interests.

To propose in the party's program draft that the state should disappear in the first stage of socialist transformation is nothing new in the modern communist movement. As early as 1918, some theorists in the Soviet Union, when discussing the new party program draft of the Russian Communist Party (Bolsheviks), raised such a demand. At that time, Lenin opposed this demand. Lenin said that in theoretical works, articles, speeches, and talks, one can and should raise these issues. However, in the program, these issues cannot be raised yet. "To raise the issue of the state's disappearance too early will disrupt the historical prospect." ("Lenin Collected Works," Vol. 27, p. 123)

When reading the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, one gets the impression that the drafters started from the incorrect idea that the state and democracy are incompatible under the socialist system. They obviously believe that if the state is not abolished and disappears, socialist democracy cannot develop.

However, this view does not conform to the Marxist-Leninist view, does not conform to the process of social development. One cannot oppose socialist democracy to the socialist state, cannot think that only the weakening and disappearance of state power can develop democracy. The classic writers of Marxism-Leninism did not oppose socialist democracy to the dictatorship of the proletariat; on the contrary, they believed that the dictatorship of the proletariat is the highest form of democracy. In the "Communist Manifesto," the concepts of "the proletariat becoming the ruling class" and "struggling for democracy" are listed together, which is not accidental. The way this issue is raised well illustrates the mutual relationship between the state and democracy in the transition from capitalism to communism.

The dictatorship of the proletariat is not a general state, not a machine for a minority to oppress the majority, but it is different from the dictatorship of the exploiting class. The classic writers of Marxism-Leninism have repeatedly said that the dictatorship of the proletariat is no longer a state in the original sense, because at this time the power belongs to the majority of society, that is, all laboring people.

The founders of Marxism believed that one of the most important characteristics of the state of the working class is that this state will be a truly democratic state. Marx emphasized the inseparable connection between the dictatorship of the proletariat and the people, writing: "This is 'transferring power to the people themselves, who replace the organized force that oppressed them with their own force.'" ("Works of Marx and Engels," Vol. 3, pp. 327-329)

When drafting the program draft, the drafters obviously did not consider that the disappearance of the state is a long-term process of objective development, and the expansion of socialist democracy does not mean the disappearance of the state. When democracy is most complete, democracy itself will also gradually disappear along with the state. Lenin wrote: "Of course, democracy is also a form of the state, which should disappear with the disappearance of the state, but this can only be achieved when socialism, which has been completely victorious and consolidated, transitions to complete communism." ("Lenin Collected Works," Vol. 22, p. 132) Later, Lenin explained that he intentionally emphasized this principle, that is, "democracy is a form of the state, and when the state disappears, democracy will also disappear." ("Lenin Collected Works," Vol. 22, p. 309)

The drafters of the program draft oppose the idolatry of the state. However, one should not have idolatry of democracy as a certain form of the state. Marxism examines various phenomena in their development, neither idolizing the state nor idolizing democracy as a form of the state.

In the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, the issue of the development of democracy, the struggle against bureaucracy, is linked to the disappearance of the state. However, the view that only the disappearance of the state can overcome bureaucracy and develop democracy is, of course, incorrect. Lenin once mercilessly fought against bureaucracy and was determined to eliminate this evil phenomenon. However, he warned against opportunism in the fight against bureaucracy. During the period of discussing the trade union issue, some people proposed the slogan of "eliminating state bureaucracy and national economic bureaucracy." At that time, Lenin said that this was a demagogic slogan. He said: "In 1919, we wrote in the program that we have bureaucracy here. Who asks you to eliminate bureaucracy, who is a demagogue. If someone stands up and says to you: 'Eliminate bureaucracy,' then this is demagogic. This is nonsense. We will fight bureaucracy for years. If someone does not see the problem this way, then he is deceiving, he is demagogic, because to overthrow bureaucracy, many measures are needed, everyone needs to be literate, everyone needs to be cultured, everyone needs to participate in the workers' and peasants' inspection bodies." ("Lenin Collected Works," Vol. 32, pp. 46-47)

The fight against bureaucracy means more broadly involving the masses in management. The Communist Party of the Soviet Union ensures that the masses creatively discuss all major issues of personal concern, strive to enhance the initiative and enthusiasm of the working people. In the formulation and discussion of various laws, state budgets, national economic plans, and plans of various enterprises, in the formulation of measures for industrial, housing, and cultural construction, in solving the problem of managing the national economy, there are representatives of state power organs elected by the people, social organizations, and the broad masses of the people, tens of millions of working people actively participating. Lenin understood the essence of socialist democracy in this way: with the development of socialist democracy, the masses participate more and more broadly in state management, in discussing and actually executing political and economic tasks. Lenin wrote: "The principle of democratic organization ... means that every representative of the masses, every citizen should be in such a condition that they can participate in the discussion of the state's laws, elect their representatives, and execute the state's laws." ("Lenin Collected Works," Vol. 27, p. 185)

The drafters of the program draft of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, under the pretext of criticizing the slogan of "party and government not being separate," actually took the path of denying the leading role of the working-class party in the socialist state. They believe that the party should only be a "thought factor," a "factor of developing socialist consciousness," but should no longer be a "political factor," a "power factor."

In the socialist state, the fighting organization of conscious communists—the revolutionary party of the working class—is the leading and guiding force. Only when the working class and the people of the people's democratic state maintain the strictest discipline and organization within their ranks can they defeat the bourgeoisie and lead all laboring masses to follow them. This discipline and organizational nature are formed and maintained by such factors as the consciousness of the vanguard of the proletariat, its loyalty to the socialist cause, its brave and unyielding spirit, its inseparable connection with the masses, and correct political leadership.

The mission of the working-class party is to educate and unite the non-party workers and all non-party laboring masses, to fight against the vacillation and influence of the petty bourgeoisie, to politically lead the entire activity of the proletariat, and to lead all laboring masses through them.

Some theorists argue that recognizing the leading role of the party in the struggle of the working class to transform society is contrary to the Marxist theory of the objective laws of social development, which is completely incorrect. Communists do not oppose their activities to the objective laws of social development but study these objective laws, summarize revolutionary practice. They follow not subjective wishes and views but objective truths.

To belittle the leading and organizational role of the party in non-party workers and all laboring masses is to deviate from scientific communism, to be a manifestation of the "theory" and practice of spontaneity and laissez-faire. Without a united, tempered party in the struggle, the working class cannot lead society to political power, cannot formulate and implement the policy of the socialist state, cannot lead the activities of all state organs and laboring people's social organizations for a unified goal—to strive for the victory of communism. Lenin taught: "The party is the vanguard of the proletariat directly seizing power, the leader." ("Lenin Collected Works," Vol. 32, p. 76)

From this, it can be seen that the drafters of the program draft of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia accuse Marxism-Leninism of "pragmatic-statism" revision, but in fact, they themselves have deviated from the basic points of Marxism about the dictatorship of the proletariat, about the disappearance of the state, and about the role of the communist party.

Due to the profound progressive changes that have taken place in the world in recent decades, the role of the thought of proletarian internationalism has greatly increased. Marxist-Leninist parties attach great importance to strengthening the international unity of the laboring masses and to the correct combination of national tasks and internationalist tasks.

In the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, there is a lot of discussion on these issues. Among them, it is said that the League of Communists of Yugoslavia "promotes the thought of proletarian internationalism within its ranks and educates the laboring masses of Yugoslavia with its spirit." The draft has some indisputable points. However, the explanation of the essence of proletarian internationalism, the explanation of the relations between socialist countries, and the explanation of the goals and tasks that the drafters believe the communist party should strive to achieve in the relations between each other and the relations between socialist countries, are one-sided and contrary to the views recognized in the international communist movement.

Lenin wrote: "There is only one true internationalism: this is to work sincerely to develop the revolutionary movement and revolutionary struggle in one's own country and to help (with propaganda, sympathy, and material) the same struggle and the same line in all countries without exception." ("Lenin Collected Works," Vol. 24, p. 54)

When there is a socialist world system, when the international workers' movement and the communist movement are growing and strengthening, when the national liberation movements of the peoples of various countries are surging, under such conditions today, what is the specific manifestation of proletarian internationalism? This is: to support the socialist world system, the workers' movement in the capitalist world supports the Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other socialist countries, while the laboring people of socialist countries also support the workers' movement in the capitalist world. All countries' communist parties unite to support the peoples of various countries who are fighting for national independence and against imperialism. The new thing in the theory and practice of proletarian internationalism in our era is that it, on the one hand, retains all the significance of the principles of the international workers' movement, and on the other hand, constitutes the basis of the relations between countries that have broken away from the shackles of capitalism and embarked on the path of building a socialist society. These countries have established equal, fraternal, and mutually supportive political, economic, and cultural relations, exchanging productive experience and scientific and technological achievements.

It is precisely the mutual assistance and cooperation of socialist countries that have not been reflected in the program draft, and this mutual assistance and cooperation is the main and basic manifestation of proletarian internationalism in the relations between these countries. According to the views in the draft, the internationalist nature of the relations between socialist countries is only manifested in the observance of the principles of equality and non-interference in internal affairs.

There is no need to argue that this is a very important principle. Marxist-Leninists have always insisted on and fought for the absolute equality of nations and states, respecting the rights, legitimate interests, national traditions, sentiments, and culture of the peoples of all countries. However, the essence of the disagreement between the views of the drafters of the program draft and the views recognized in the international communist workers' movement is not whether it is necessary to strictly adhere to the principle of equality. The essence of this disagreement is that in the program draft, proletarian internationalism is only reduced to the principles of equality and non-interference in internal affairs, while the necessity of strengthening the unity and cooperation of socialist countries and Marxist-Leninist parties is ignored.

The demand for recognizing national equality is also a characteristic of petty-bourgeois nationalism. As Lenin pointed out, it declares that recognizing the equality of all nations is internationalism, but even this is purely verbal, and in fact, it completely retains national egoism. Lenin explained that in the situation where the dictatorship of the proletariat is about to be established in some countries and will be able to have a decisive influence on world politics, the struggle against the deeply rooted nationalist prejudices of the petty bourgeoisie will be particularly urgent and pressing. Proletarian internationalism, in some cases, requires the interests of the proletarian struggle of one country to be subordinate to the interests of the struggle on a world scale.

However, in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, it is only mentioned that the relations between socialist countries "must be established on the principles of independence, complete equality, and respect for the characteristics of each country."

The struggle to establish these principles in the relations between socialist countries and proletarian parties is essentially regarded in the program draft as the only issue of internationalism, as the "highest goal of the relations between socialist countries and the socialist movement."

One cannot but completely reasonably ask: Can the principles of equality and non-interference represent the entire essence of the relations between socialist countries? No, it cannot. The fate of these countries is tightly linked by the commonality of their social system and state system, interests, and goals. In their relations, they strictly adhere to the principle of equality based on fraternal mutual assistance and support. Each of them strives to provide comprehensive assistance and support to brotherly countries in the construction of a socialist society, while relying on their assistance and support. In this, the principle of equality is not violated: socialist mutual assistance, by its nature, excludes the possibility of one country gaining an advantage at the expense of another country's interests. On the contrary, it promotes common progress, more fully utilizes the material and spiritual strength of each nation in the socialist family, and strengthens the strength of the entire family.

The drafters of the program draft of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia mentioned that there may be violations of socialist principles in the relations between socialist countries, attempting to use this to support their one-sided understanding of proletarian internationalism. They wrote, "Practice shows that, either due to a strong international political position, or due to different levels of economic development, there may be situations where one socialist country maintains unequal relations with another or other socialist countries in various ways."

This statement is groundless. The practice of the relations between socialist countries, the practice mentioned by the drafters of the program draft, actually refutes this statement. This practice proves that under the socialist system, the cooperation between the peoples of various countries, due to its nature, will not damage equality and independence. Socialist countries are truly autonomous and independent.

Arranging the relations between socialist countries is a very complex and entirely new thing in history. Indeed, some mistakes and shortcomings have been made in this matter. However, everyone knows that these mistakes and shortcomings have already become history and have been resolutely eliminated. Even when they existed, they were not the essence of the relations between socialist countries, which were essentially truly socialist and internationalist.

Marxist-Leninist parties have always adhered to the principles of proletarian internationalism. The 20th Congress of the CPSU again affirmed the necessity of consistently implementing the Leninist principle of equality, emphasizing the importance of considering the historical and national characteristics of socialist countries. As early as before the congress, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet government actively eliminated the mistakes made in the past in relations with Yugoslavia. However, the drafters of the program draft cited the shortcomings and mistakes that had occurred in the past in the relations between socialist countries, essentially negated the entire experience of these relations, ignored the basic and main thing in this regard—the internationalist nature, fraternal mutual assistance, and cooperation.

The terms "ideological monopoly" and "political hegemony" used in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia are essentially opposed to the common principles and common laws of socialist revolution and socialist construction, and therefore are opposed to the ideological and political unity of the international communist movement. The Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia attempted to refute with the entire content of the draft it drafted the principle of Marxism-Leninism, which has been affirmed by practice, about the common laws of the development of all countries towards socialism (while each country considers its own historical and national characteristics to solve the specific problems of socialist transformation). According to the views expressed in the draft, each country should advance towards socialism through its own special path, completely based on its own special conditions, without paying attention to the common points possessed by the countries building socialism. The draft actually supports "national communism," which is known to emphasize the national characteristics of socialist construction while denying the main and universally significant things revealed in the experience of socialist countries. This document regards the criticism of the thought of "national communism" as a result of "dogmatic ideas or great-power chauvinistic ideas, or the influence or conspiracy of bourgeois thought."

On the fundamental issues of the socialist revolution and socialist construction, there are common Marxist-Leninist views, which are reflected in the declaration of the representatives of the communist and workers' parties of socialist countries and are supported by the communist parties of capitalist countries. The drafters of the program draft of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia desperately oppose this summary of the entire experience of modern social development with their own fabricated concepts. Who is trying to "ideological monopoly"? If all brotherly parties hold unified thoughts, there is no question of any party having an "ideological monopoly."

Will the ideological unity of the Marxist-Leninist parties of various countries reduce the independence of the parties of various countries? No, not at all. The ideological unity and mutual support of the brotherly parties of various countries and their victory in completing national tasks and international tasks, the smooth fulfillment of the obligations undertaken by the parties of various countries to their own working class and people, are the most important conditions. If any party insists on taking a different ideological position from the international communist movement, then it will have the danger of deviating from the correct path, separating from the international communist movement, and isolating itself.

In the famous declaration of the representatives of the communist and workers' parties of socialist countries, the importance of strengthening the unity of the Marxist-Leninist parties of various countries is strongly emphasized. These parties bear a particularly heavy historical responsibility for the fate of the world socialist system and the international communist movement. The declaration says: "There is no doubt that in order to effectively unite the working class, unite all laboring people and progressive humanity, unite all the forces of the world that love freedom and peace, it is first necessary to strengthen the unity of the communist and workers' parties themselves, strengthen the unity between the communist and workers' parties of various countries. This unity is the core of all broader unity, the most basic guarantee of the victory of the cause of the working class." The declaration goes on to say: "The participating communist and workers' parties of various countries declare that for the further unity of the socialist family of countries, for the benefit of the international workers' movement and the cause of peace and socialism, they will consistently strengthen their unity and comradely cooperation."

The drafters of the program draft say: "Whether a certain thought or a certain form of socialist construction is correct and progressive depends only on whether it has vitality and can withstand the test of practice, and not on the approval of this or that international center." This statement naturally makes one wonder: Is it not from practice, from the study of theoretical issues and the summary of historical experience, that a certain center of the Marxist-Leninist party is produced? Undoubtedly, it is produced from revolutionary practice. Of course, the declarations of the congresses of the parties of various countries, if they do not have scientific thought, are another matter. However, history has not presented any basis to say that the resolutions of the congresses of the communist parties of various countries are incorrect. The theory of scientific communism is produced from the summary of experience, the summary of the practice of the international workers' movement, the summary of the experience of the entire historical development. This theory is developed by the collective efforts of the parties of various countries, including the international centers of the parties of various countries. One cannot but mention that the programmatic document of scientific communism, the "Communist Manifesto," was drafted by Marx and Engels at the request of the congress of the international proletarian organization "Communist League" and was supported by the international workers' movement.

Since the drafters of the program draft of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia mentioned the so-called "hegemony" in the workers' movement, we must put forward the following view. Marxism-Leninism does not deny the possibility that a certain party of a country, a certain socialist country, may play a leading role in a certain historical period. However, which party or which country leads the international workers' movement does not depend on anyone's subjective wishes but on objective conditions. This is specifically determined by the following conditions: where the center of the revolutionary movement is, where the urgent tasks of revolutionary transformation of society are first actually solved.

For example, in the mid-19th century, the center of the revolutionary movement was in Germany. At that time, the leading role was played by the Social Democratic Party of Germany, and the leaders of the German working class, Marx and Engels, became the leaders of the world proletariat and the founders of scientific communism. At the end of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century, the center of the world revolution shifted to Russia, so the Russian working class and our Communist Party, due to the process of historical development, stood at the forefront of the international workers' movement, and the founder and leader of our Communist Party, Lenin, also became the leader recognized by the world proletariat, the successor of the cause of Marx and Engels.

The participants of the conference of the communist and workers' parties of socialist countries held in November 1957 pointed out in the declaration they adopted that the indestructible socialist camp is headed by the Soviet Union. These words reflect the leading role of the Soviet Union in the struggle for social progress, people's freedom, and the cause of peace, which is a fact formed in history.

The Soviet Union is the first country where the dictatorship of the proletariat has achieved victory; it has opened the path to socialism and is now solving the task of completing the construction of a socialist society and gradually transitioning to communism. Any objective person will not fail to see that the main blows of international imperialism against all socialist countries are mainly borne by the Soviet Union. One can recall the early post-war years. At that time, the imperialist powers exerted extremely great pressure on the young, not yet consolidated people's democratic countries, trying to interfere in their internal affairs, to support the exploiting classes, and to strangle the people's desire to move towards a new socialist life. Only because of the strength of the Soviet Union, because of its resolute counterattack against the policy of imperialist aggression, because of the close alliance of all countries that have broken away from the capitalist system, the historical fruits of these countries' peoples were preserved, and the peaceful conditions for their constructive labor were guaranteed. In the autumn of 1956, the Soviet Union, at the request of the Hungarian government, provided fraternal assistance to the people of that country, helping them to crush the counter-revolutionary rebellion instigated by the Horthyites, the agents of imperialism. To call the selfless assistance of the Soviet Union to other countries in consolidating their independence, consolidating and developing the fruits of socialism, "hegemony," is to deviate from proletarian internationalism. To play a leading role in the socialist camp, to play the role of the vanguard in the world revolutionary movement, has nothing to do with "hegemony."

However, does the true threat to the independence of socialist countries exist? Yes, it does. But this threat, as mentioned in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, does not come from "a certain socialist country" but from international imperialism. Imperialist bourgeoisie, instead of welcoming the birth of socialist countries with bells, respond with mad hatred, and in many cases, with guns. After the imperialists' repeated attempts to destroy and sabotage the Soviet state and people's democratic countries, and after the recent Hungarian incident, everyone is well aware that the imperialist reactionaries, past and present, do not accept the existence of these countries. The extensive subversive activities planned by the imperialist bloc against the countries of the socialist camp are well known.

All this precisely illustrates one point: it is necessary to strengthen the fraternal friendship and unity of the peoples of socialist countries, to make their internationalist unity grow and develop. The close unity and mutual support of socialist countries are the guarantee of their independence, the pillar of people's freedom, social progress, and the cause of world peace. The points raised in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia cannot promote the strengthening of the unity of socialist countries.

The draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia did not point out the fact that socialism has established a new type of international relations with world-historical significance. Moreover, the drafters of the draft essentially negated this fact and arbitrarily attributed some characteristics of international relations produced under the rule of the exploiting class to socialism.

The drafters of the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia believe that some socialist countries may exploit other socialist countries, which is a strange and horrifying "theory." The drafters of the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia believe that under capitalist conditions, stronger countries try to gain hegemony, rule other peoples, and establish world rule, exploit and oppress weak countries, and then write: "Similar tendencies in the early stages of socialist development are also a constant danger, that is, as long as the huge differences in the economic development of various countries still cause great disparities in the material conditions of the laboring people of various countries, and as long as the hegemony of individual nations or individual countries due to certain reasons can still use this or that form of economic exploitation against other countries, there will be such a danger. As long as there is such a possibility, there will be the idea and attempt to use this possibility."

The drafters of the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia claim that there is an exploitative tendency in the relations between socialist countries. This statement is completely contrary to the facts and is pure fabrication. This point is not clear? These statements are all based on the point of view they proposed, which is contrary to objective reality, that is, it seems that there is "imbalance in socialist development." Here, the drafters of the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia confuse the laws of imperialist development with the laws of socialist development. Everyone knows that under imperialist conditions, the law of uneven development of the economy and politics of capitalist countries is at work.

Under imperialist conditions, what does the uneven development of capitalism mean? This first of all means that the development of imperialist countries is leaping, conflicting. Some countries surpass other countries, push them aside, and develop themselves. At the same time, the exploitation of the laboring masses by monopoly capital and the plunder of dependent and semi-dependent countries are also intensified. Newly emerging countries defeat competing countries, trying to expand their sphere of influence, markets for commodity sales, and sources of raw materials, trying to rule the world. On this basis, sharp conflicts constantly occur, and wars to seize the territory of other countries and enslave the peoples of various countries occur.

The socialist revolution overthrew capitalism, established the dictatorship of the proletariat, and with the nationalization of the decisive means of production, eliminated the basis for the operation of the law of uneven development of the economy and politics of various countries. Contrary to the law of uneven development of capitalist countries under imperialist conditions, the law of even and balanced development of various countries operates in the world socialist system. With the growth of the economic strength of socialist countries and the strengthening of the position of socialism on the world stage, the significance of this evenness becomes greater. In the world socialist system, due to the mutual assistance and cooperation between countries, economically and culturally backward countries can quickly catch up with advanced countries, thus presenting a picture of common prosperity, which is the characteristic of socialism. The more solid the unity of socialist countries is, the more extensive and perfect their cooperation is, the more smoothly the process of progress will be. In the process of socialist construction, the actual inequalities in the economic and cultural development of the peoples of various countries left over from history are quickly overcome, and the level of development of various nations and countries gradually tends to balance.

For example, the Soviet Union, before the October Socialist Revolution, the economic and cultural development levels of the central provinces of Russia and the national border areas were very different. Only forty years later, the former national border areas, the Soviet Socialist Republics, are now on a par with the Russian Federation in terms of economic and cultural levels. They have highly developed industry based on modern technology and large-scale mechanized agriculture. The culture of the peoples of all nationalities of the Soviet Union has truly flourished. Many nationalities that did not even have their own writing in the past are also developing socialist content and national forms of culture, literature, and art. All this embodies the great transformative power of socialism, which is the result of the true internationalist policy of Leninism executed by the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and the Soviet state, the result of the friendly cooperation of the peoples of all nationalities of the Soviet Union.

The Soviet Union, the People's Republic of China, and other people's democratic countries are constantly strengthening their friendship and unity with each other and are also making every effort to expand economic and cultural ties with all other countries that have such a desire. The unity of the countries of the socialist camp is not for the purpose of opposing any other country. However, each country in this camp correctly believes that its relations with socialist countries should be closer than with capitalist countries.

If the line proposed in foreign policy is essentially the same as that proposed in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia, it will cause the separation of socialist countries from each other and weaken their friendship and unity. Undoubtedly, this poses a serious danger to the independence of each socialist country and the entire socialist cause.

The more thoroughly the principles of proletarian internationalism are implemented, the more resolutely the struggle against chauvinism and nationalism is waged, the more solid the unity between the socialist countries and the communist and workers' parties of various countries will be. Lenin particularly emphasized the need to fight against nationalism that is very cunning in advocating the division of the working class under beautiful and eloquent pretexts. Lenin wrote:

"Conscious workers spare no effort to resist all kinds of nationalism, whether it is crude, violent, gangster nationalism, or that most cunning nationalism that advocates the equality of all nations ... while dividing the cause of the workers, the organizations of the workers, and the workers' movement by nationality." ("Lenin Collected Works," Vol. 20, p. 266)

This article discusses some essential issues raised in the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia. After analyzing the points raised in the draft, one can draw the following conclusion: although the drafters of the document say they want to "enrich the common socialist treasure of all mankind," in fact, they have inserted many views that are inconsistent with Marxism-Leninism.

In this regard, the drafters of the program draft even dare to say that "in the past few decades, Marxist thought has lagged behind the development of modern society."

At present, when the thought of Marxism-Leninism has grasped the hearts of millions of people, when almost one-third of the world's population is building a socialist society under the banner of Marxism-Leninism, when socialism has achieved victories of world-historical significance, when socialist construction is no longer groping forward but is illuminated by the brilliant thought of Marxism-Leninism, which is constantly enriched in the process of socialist construction, at such a time, to hear someone say that Marxism-Leninism thought has "lagged behind" is strange. The resolutions of the 20th Congress of the CPSU, the 8th Congress of the CCP, and other Marxist-Leninist parties on the fundamental issues of contemporary social development have been extremely convincing! The theoretical summary made at the conference of the communist and workers' parties held in Moscow in the autumn of 1957 has great significance.

The propaganda organs of the bourgeoisie seized the points in the draft program that are contrary to the thought principles of communism to achieve their own purposes. They desperately flatter the drafters of the draft program, praising the draft program, saying that it "provides broad theoretical arguments for the fundamental disagreement with the Moscow line," saying that it "again raises the ideological views that caused a sharp dispute with the Kremlin in the autumn of 1956." However, everyone has long known that the propaganda organs of the bourgeoisie attack the "Moscow line" and the "Kremlin," referring to the line of the entire international communist movement. The propaganda organs of the bourgeoisie have always been wrong in their attempts to weaken the international communist movement, and this time they will definitely make mistakes again.

The draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia reflects in a summary form the disagreements that are not just emerging now between the Yugoslav comrades and the international communist movement. The draft program shows that these disagreements still exist on many important issues.

Everyone knows that for the sake of peace and the cause of socialism, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union and other brotherly parties have made many efforts in recent years to approach the League of Communists of Yugoslavia on the basis of Marxist-Leninist principles. In this regard, the Communist Party of the Soviet Union has always started from the point that this approach cannot be achieved by concessions at the expense of Marxist-Leninist principles. Now, when the draft program of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia obviously deviates from the theoretical basis of Marxism-Leninism on a series of extremely important issues, it is no longer possible to remain silent and not to raise comradely and principled criticism.

Of course, comradely criticism of the party should not become an obstacle to the continued development of friendly relations between our two parties and two countries.

The Program Drafting Commission of the Central Committee of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia is continuing to improve the draft. We sincerely hope that the Yugoslav comrades will achieve success in this great matter. We hope that the new draft will be completely based on the principles of Marxism-Leninism, thus conforming to the interests of the League of Communists of Yugoslavia and the people of Yugoslavia, and will be beneficial to strengthening the unity of the brotherly socialist countries, the brotherly communist and workers' parties, and the cause of peace, democracy, and socialism. Such a draft program will definitely make all communists deeply satisfied.

    评南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案
    苏联　费多谢耶夫　波麦洛夫　契普拉科夫
    今年三月南斯拉夫发表了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央委员会纲领起草委员会草拟的、将提交在4月22日开幕的第七次代表大会讨论的南共纲领草案，现在正在进行讨论。据南斯拉夫报纸报道，南斯拉夫共产主义者在讨论过程中提出了许多意见和建议，以便有助于纲领的定稿工作。
    讨论和通过纲领，是每一个共产党生活中的大事。这是一个党的内部事务，不过也引起其他国家共产党人的注意，这是很自然的。南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案所以引起注意的另一个原因，是因为纲领中所研究的问题已经远远超出了南斯拉夫内部问题的范围。在纲领序言中就直接谈到了这一点：
    “南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领是对现代世界矛盾的分析。它确定了南斯拉夫共产党人对世界的社会、经济和政治关系一般问题的观点和立场。
      “南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领，表达了对当代国际工人运动和世界社会主义发展中某些最根本的问题的原则性见解。”
    阅读南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案时可以看出，其中包括了一系列马克思列宁主义的共同原则，有不少正确的总结。但是令人遗憾的是，其中还有许多地方同马克思列宁主义的理论和实践、同世界共产主义运动的理论和实践显然是有分歧的。这一点特别表现在如下几个问题上：关于现代国际发展的问题，两个世界体系的问题，各个国家、首先是苏联建设社会主义的经验的问题，社会主义国家的问题，无产阶级国际主义和各个社会主义国家之间、各个共产党之间的相互关系问题，以及对现代修正主义和教条主义的认识问题。
    不能不提到，纲领草案中对现代国际局势的估计，对世界社会主义体系的发展以及对国际工人运动和共产主义运动发展的估计，在一系列极重要的问题上，是同1957年11月各国共产党和工人党代表会议上通过的宣言和和平宣言中的估计相违背的。纲领草案的起草人指出，在为社会主义而斗争的现阶段，“对某些理论和实践问题的看法上存在着一定的分歧”。因此，这就不是局部的问题，而是社会主义理论和实践上的原则性问题，在这些问题上，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案中提出了特别的主张。
    这些日子里南斯拉夫正在讨论南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案，我们愿意就一些原则性的问题提出一些同志式的意见，希望能得到纲领草案起草人的欢迎和讨论。
    在南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案中，关于现代资本主义和过渡到社会主义的道路的问题占有显著的地位。这里的中心思想是，在革命的社会主义改造的同时，还进行着资本主义改造为社会主义的进化过程。由于企图证明社会主义社会也可以通过进化的道路产生，于是对现代资本主义的特有现象和过程，就产生了一系列反科学的、非马克思主义的、非列宁主义的观点。
    在纲领草案中，关于垄断资本主义的正确观点中掺杂着错误的观点，在谈到目前发达的资本主义国家中占主导地位的国家垄断资本主义的地方更为如此。在这个文件中，把国家垄断资本主义发展中的政治因素突出地提到了首要地位，忽略了对于资本主义所固有的内在经济规律的分析。
    草案的起草人一方面正确地指出了资本主义国家在资本主义经济中日益增长的作用，但是又不正确地阐述了垄断资本同它的国家之间的关系。纲领草案中说，国家“日益监督资本，部分地限制私人管理资本主义财产的权利，并剥夺私人资本所有者在经济和社会中的某些独立职能。
    “垄断资本巨头同国家管理联系起来的过程仍在继续。垄断资本巨头在他们掌管的某些部门中日益丧失其原有的完全独立的作用，而垄断资本的某些职能在越来越大的程度上转交给国家。”
    认为国家干涉会缩小垄断资本的经济力量基础，是不符合资本主义社会的实际情况的。难道英国、意大利、法国的个别企业和个别行业的国家化缩小了整个垄断资本的经济力量的基础吗？绝对没有！这种干涉把陷在技术落后和亏本的工业部门（煤炭工业等）中的垄断资本解放出来。这种干涉把困难转嫁给纳税者，并且使资本家有可能把他们的资本投入其他更有利的部门。这种干涉使落后工业部门可以靠国家预算来更换自己的设备，于是垄断资本就能够获得廉价的煤和电力等，这就使所有垄断资本都分沾利益。
    难道资本主义国家所进行的监督和调节限制了资本家对于财产的所有权和支配权吗？难道减少了雇佣工人受剥削的程度吗？当然没有！只要提出列宁的问题：谁监督谁，也就是说哪个阶级是监督者，哪个阶级是被监督者，那就很清楚，资本主义国家的监督和调节是有利于垄断资本和反对工人阶级的。
    国家垄断资本主义的增长意味着垄断资本的进一步加强、意味着经济和政治权力进一步集中到垄断资本手中，意味着垄断资本利用国家为他们的自私的目的服务，并损害劳动人民的利益。
    从纲领草案起草人下面的论断可以看出他们离开列宁主义有多么远：“由私人资本转给国家的某些职能愈多（在这种情况下往往采取不同方式限制私人资本的权力），经济中的新的、就其客观趋向来说是社会主义的因素对资本主义生产方式的压力就愈大。”
    对于纲领起草人来说，国家成了同资本主义社会两个敌对阶级（资产阶级和无产阶级）对峙的超阶级的机构。草案中说：“国家机构，为获得其独立职能，往往把自己置于社会之上，并且日益表现出限制私人资本作用和工人阶级作用的倾向。”
    说资本主义国家“限制”工人阶级的作用，更正确地说是向无产阶级的政治权利和切身经济利益发动进攻，这是毫无疑问的。然而能够指出一些有份量的事实来说明资产阶级国家反对资产阶级利益和反对垄断资本吗？不，不可能！资本主义国家可以反对、而且也正在反对中小资本家来迎合大资本家，它可以限制个别的股份公司，但是它却永远必然为资产阶级的共同利益、为垄断资本的利益服务。
    列宁曾经正确地指出过，并且生活也不断证明了，“生产更进一步垄断和进一步国家化的过程，必然伴随着对于劳动群众剥削的加强、压迫的加强、反对剥削者的困难的增加、反动势力和军事专制的加强，同时也必然导致大资本家损害所有其他各阶层居民的利益而使自己的利润异常地增加，使劳动群众在几十年中受到贡税的奴役，要向资本家交纳数以十亿计的债款利息。”（“列宁全集”第24卷，第276—277页）
    在目前的条件下，当社会主义世界体系取得了鼓舞资本主义国家人民群众的巨大胜利时，垄断资产阶级也不得不作出某些社会经济性质的让步。然而，绝对不能因此就像南共纲领草案那样认为，资产阶级国家是超阶级的，是公正的“劳动关系和财产关系方面的调节人”。
    草案中的下面的论断也绝对不能反映现实生活：“资产阶级和工人阶级为其在国家资本主义制度中的影响和地位而进行的政治斗争中的均势愈大，官僚分子的职能也就在努力保留国家资本主义关系的同时更为独立。”毫无疑问，很多资本主义国家中的无产阶级的力量壮大了，但是国家机器仍然操纵在帝国主义资产阶级的手中，执行着它们的意志。关于在现代资本主义条件下国家的“独立性”的论点抹煞了资本主义国家的阶级实质，并且转移了无产阶级对于用革命方法夺取政权的历史任务的注意力。
    现代资产阶级国家是资本家用来维持整个资本主义生产条件的阶级机构。它实质上是资本家的国家，是标准的资本家总和。受它支配的生产力越多，受它剥削的公民也就越多。在这种情况下，工人仍然是雇佣工人，是无产者，资本家仍然是资本家，是剥削者。国家垄断资本所有制不能解决生产力和生产关系之间的冲突，而只是包含着解决这种冲突的可能性。
    在资本主义社会里，个别经济部门的国有化无论怎样重要，本身也不能直接导致社会主义。这已为事实所证明。例如，英国工党政府实行了某些经济部门的国有化，但是并没有使国家走到社会主义。要实现社会主义，必须工人阶级建立自己的政治统治，把基本生产资料掌握在手中，并且实现社会的社会主义改组。只有在实现了这一点的国家里才会有社会主义。马克思列宁主义者一向认为，国家资本主义不会自行过渡到社会主义，而只有通过社会主义革命才能过渡到社会主义。国家垄断资本主义只是加强了建立社会主义的物质前提。
    南共纲领草案中包含有正确的论点，同时也有不少论点与上述论点有矛盾，这些论点给人们的结论是，只要资本主义中的“社会主义现象”、“因素”、“倾向”单纯在数量上不断增加和积累，就能过渡到社会主义，也就是说，在资本主义制度中可以自发地长出社会主义。例如，纲领草案的起草人一方面指出“只有工人阶级自觉的政治活动”才可能实现向社会主义的过渡，但另一方面却把这种活动仅仅归结为“争取政权中的领导作用”，也就是说在现有的资产阶级政权中争取领导作用。他们说，“社会主义倾向渗入国家资本主义制度”，他们还说，“国家资本主义关系的特殊形式可以是资本主义保全自己的最后努力，也可以是走向社会主义的第一步，也可以同时既是前者也是后者”等等。
    这样来提从资本主义过渡到社会主义的问题是不能令人同意的。马克思列宁主义认为，“资本主义自己替自己造成了掘墓人，自己造成了新制度底原素，但同时这些单个的原素若不经过‘突变’，便丝毫也不能改变一般实际情形，不能触动资本的统治。”（“列宁全集”第16卷，第318页）
    纲领草案的起草人认为，“所谓经济民主的发展程度也取决于”争取工业国有化、争取工人参与管理国有化和私营的生产的斗争是否顺利。然而，工人参加“管理”资本主义生产，如果脱离群众性的政治斗争，本身就不具有革命的社会主义性质。如果不同群众的政治斗争联系起来，这样的口号就不外是号召工人组织长入资本主义制度之中，号召人们放弃革命斗争。
    纲领草案中还有一点特别令人注意，这就是对摆脱了殖民主义压迫的国家的社会发展途径问题给予十分简单化的解释；纲领草案在论述这个复杂问题时没有全面考虑上述国家的特点，也没有考虑内外因素对它们的发展的影响。
    纲领草案的起草人把资产阶级国家看作是超阶级的东西，这就违背了列宁关于打破旧的资产阶级国家机器和建立新的无产阶级国家机器的学说。在他们看来，整个问题仅仅归结为，工人和资本家为争取对一个国家机器的控制而斗争。纲领草案说，资产阶级“竭力首先通过对国家政权机构的决定性监督，来保持尽可能多的阵地和基本的社会特权。……与此相反，工人阶级自觉和自发地……不断施加压力，以消除或限制资产阶级的各种特权，并为扩大和加速经济职能的社会化、为争取在管理这些职能的机构中起决定性作用和掌握国家政权而斗争”。草案中还指出，工人阶级“争取政权中的领导作用”、“将国家机器变为社会的公仆”的斗争可以实现从国家资本主义向社会主义的过渡。
    历史经验告诉我们，用马克思列宁主义立场对现代社会发展所作的分析也表明，在任何情况下，向社会主义过渡的必要前提都是：无产阶级在它的先锋队的领导下夺得国家政权、建立工人阶级的政治统治，建立这种或者那种形式的无产阶级专政，依靠这个政权把生产资料变成全民的、国家的财产，进行社会主义改造。
    共产党认为，社会的社会主义改造可以视各国具体条件的不同，或者通过暴力的道路，或者通过和平的道路。然而就是和平的道路也是革命发展的道路，是革命的一种形式。某些南斯拉夫理论家却不提同是革命性的暴力或和平的道路，而提革命和“进化”的道路。其中第二条道路不是革命的道路。
    工人阶级争取用社会主义原则对社会进行革命的改造的斗争，必须是在马克思列宁主义政党的领导下，才有可能取得胜利。然而南共纲领草案的起草人居然认为有可能通过非革命演进的道路达到社会主义，结果他们自然就会否定党的领导作用。不但如此，他们还认为，共产党在工人革命运动中的领导作用是“垄断”。他们说：“认为共产主义政党可以垄断社会主义运动的每种形式、并认为社会主义只有在这些党里也只有通过这些党才能体现出来的观念，在理论上是不正确的，在实践中也是十分有害的”。
    纲领草案的起草人甚至认为，在某些国家，工人阶级可以根本不要自己的政党就能取得政权和实现社会主义。他们写道：“在实际上不存在什么典型工人阶级政党的国家里，譬如美国，最大的可能就是把工人群众组织在工会里，首先通过工会日益把他们卷入自觉的社会主义力量成长的过程，卷入工人阶级为加强其社会影响和争取在政权体系中的领导作用的斗争中去”。这种结论难道有什么事实根据吗？难道工会，尤其是目前站在保护资本主义制度立场上的美国工会，有可能使美国达到社会主义吗？这种假定大概会使美国工会的领导人也诧异不止。
    在南共纲领草案中，虽然也提到了各国共产党和工人党的功绩，但是对现阶段国际共产主义运动的发展、它的队伍的团结和一致的加强，却几乎没有提到。重点移到了对各国共产党活动中某些缺点的无端的批评。据说，“官僚主义、教条主义、以左的词句掩盖的机会主义、宗派主义，过分相信实力，以及思想垄断和政治垄断等”，都是这些党所固有的。不用说，这种说法不符合实际情况，并且同兄弟共产党之间为了加强思想——政治一致所可以进行的原则性的、同志式的批评毫无共同之处。
    世界共产主义运动正在蓬勃发展。各国兄弟共产党和工人党代表去年秋天在莫斯科举行的会议极其有力地显示了这个运动的团结一致和它的重大成就。
    南共纲领草案在阐释国际关系方面的严重缺点是，它忽视了世界已经分裂成为两个体系——社会主义体系和资本主义体系这样一个具有世界历史意义的事实。不错，在这个文件中也可以看到“社会主义世界”的字样，但是，这几个字并不是指实际存在的社会主义世界体系，而是指某种非常模糊不清的东西。草案中指出，南斯拉夫作为一个社会主义国家，“是社会主义世界、即现代人类的社会主义和进步力量的组成部分”。
    纲领草案没有充分明确地揭示现代世界发展的基本矛盾——受到资本主义国家工人阶级和经济上不发达国家人民群众支持的、不断壮大和不断加强的世界社会主义体系同已经过时的、然而还保存着相当有力的地位的资本主义体系之间的矛盾和斗争。关于有两个世界体系存在的问题，实质上被关于两种军事政治集团的问题所代替了。草案虽然也指出了南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟对现有各种集团的社会、经济和政治的实质以及作用的看法是有区别的，但是在具体分析国际局势紧张原因的时候却没有把两种集团分别对待。
    大家知道，战争威胁的根源在于帝国主义的本质。然而草案的起草人认为国际局势紧张的根本原因不是帝国主义国家的侵略政策，而是由于两种军事政治集团的存在。这显然是违背马克思列宁主义关于国际局势紧张的原因的原理的。和平宣言中说，“对和平事业的威胁，对各国人民安全的威胁是来自何处呢？热中于战争的和幻想战争的是在两次世界大战中、在目前的军备竞赛中大发横财的垄断资本集团。”下面接着说，“一些资本主义国家的统治集团在垄断资本、尤其是美国垄断资本的压力下拒绝关于裁军、禁止核武器及其他防止新战争的措施等建议。”和平宣言同时指出，“在所有社会主义国家都没有热中于战争的阶级和社会阶层。这里执政的是工人和农民，他们在过去所有战争中都受牺牲最大。难道他们会希望新战争吗？共产党人的目的是要建成能保证全体人民的福利、各族人民的繁荣、各民族间永久和平的社会。社会主义国家需要持久的和平来建设这种社会。”
    可见，也有南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟的代表参加制定和投票通过的和平宣言已经指出，对和平事业的危险起源于资本主义垄断资本，无论是共产党或社会主义国家都没有发动战争和对别国实行军事进攻的动机。而南共纲领草案却认为战争危险的根源是由于存在着集团，它把社会主义国家的和平政策和帝国主义国家统治集团的侵略政策混为一谈了。
    极其令人惊奇的是，纲领草案中根本没有谈到导致帝国主义国家之间矛盾尖锐化的资本主义发展不平衡性的加深，也没有谈到西德军国主义复活、美国的侵略政策以及主要资本主义国家的经济军事化。看来，共产党人的纲领中是不能回避这些问题的，这尤其是因为反对帝国主义侵略的任务已经在社会主义国家共产党和工人党的代表们通过的、受到整个国际共产主义运动支持的宣言中特别有力地指明了。宣言中说，“美国的帝国主义侵略集团，力图依靠所谓‘实力地位’政策统治世界上大多数国家，并且企图阻挠人类按照社会发展规律前进。它们打着‘反共’的幌子，企图统治越来越多的国家，力图消灭民主自由，威胁发达的资本主义国家的民族独立，想要以新的形式给已经解放了的人民重新套上殖民枷锁，并且经常不断地对社会主义国家进行敌对的颠覆活动。美国某些侵略集团的政策是要把资本主义世界的一切反动势力集结在自己的周围。这样，这些集团就成为全世界反动势力的中心，成为人民群众的最凶恶的敌人。”
    然而，这一切都被南共纲领草案起草人所无视了。看了草案后使人产生这样一种印象：批评的锋芒客观上是针对着社会主义国家和工人政党的；在批评集团的幌子下实际上是批评共产党和社会主义阵营的一致。
    大家知道，帝国主义、而且只有帝国主义在执行实力地位政策，然而纲领的起草人却硬说社会主义国家也在执行这种政策。纲领起草人写道，“国际关系之所以不能获得较长时期较巩固的稳定，首先就是由于目前矛盾的尖锐化促使这些或那些大国、这个或那个集团对国际关系强加实力地位的政策。”
    纲领草案毫无根据地把全体爱好和平人民合理地对西方国家统治集团的帝国主义政策提出的一切指责，也加到一贯执行和平外交政策的社会主义国家头上，不分皂白地把“霸权”这个字眼既用来评价帝国主义国家的政策，也用来评价社会主义国家的政策。
    例如，苏联实行的外交政策是不是可以叫做“实力政策”呢？当然不能！实力政策就是：为了建立自己的世界霸权而准备新战争，强迫他国接受自己的意志，力图剥削世界，获得垄断性超额利润。苏联实行的是和平的外交政策，它没有任何侵略和掠夺的目的。苏联没有任何经济上的动机驱使它去侵占别国土地和掠夺别国人民。
    实力政策是由垄断资产阶级的世界观产生的，垄断资产阶级认为，可以用“实力”来阻止或者甚至消除历史发展的客观规律的作用。这是垂死阶级的信念的标志。苏联把自己的政策建立在马克思列宁主义基础上，而马克思列宁主义同资产阶级唯心主义的“暴力论”是格格不入的，它是从客观历史规律出发的，根据客观历史规律，过时的社会制度要被另一种先进的社会制度所代替。
    在纲领草案中包含着一些关于所谓划分“利益范围”和“势力范围”的毫无根据的说法，硬认为世界上第一个社会主义国家也参加了这种划分，这些说法引起了坚决的抗议和反对。草案中说：“划分势力范围的方法和其他类似的政治形式早在德黑兰、雅尔塔和波茨坦同盟国首脑会议上就已经出现，而在战后继续存在着。”在草案的另一个地方说：“势力范围的政策毒化了（并继续毒化着）国际关系。德国、朝鲜和越南的人民生活在分割为拥有不同社会制度和人为界限的国家里，它们是公开冲突潜在的策源地。”
    大家都知道，无论在德黑兰、雅尔塔、或波茨坦，苏联都没有为自己争取任何“利益范围”和“势力范围”。苏联在这些会议上进行斗争，是为了中欧和东南欧各国的民族独立和国家主权，决不是为了争取自己的势力范围。这乃是使挣脱了法西斯枷锁的各国人民有可能选择社会主义发展道路的条件之一。
    至于说德国、朝鲜和越南人民遭到分裂，那是帝国主义者造成的，他们反对这些国家之中任何一国和平统一。根据官方文件可以了解，到现在为止，在这些问题上，例如在德国问题上，苏联和南斯拉夫的立场是没有分歧的。我们想提醒一点，在苏联和南斯拉夫两国政府在南斯拉夫总统约·布·铁托访问苏联时发表的联合声明中指出：“……两国政府认为，在战后德国领土上形成了两个主权国家的今天，要达到德国的统一，必须通过德意志联邦共和国和德意志民主共和国之间的谈判。它们还认为，其余的国家，首先是大国，应当为了德国人民的利益，同时也为了共同的利益而在这方面作出努力。”
    在军备竞赛、“通过武装保持均势”的政策、核能利用等方面，纲领草案的起草人又对双方都加以谴责，虽然大家知道，社会主义阵营对军备竞赛是没有任何责任的。这个阵营的成员国正在尽它们的一切力量来制止军备竞赛。但是很自然的，社会主义国家也在采取一切必要的措施保障自己的安全。这点对保障未参加社会主义阵营的国家的安全，也有不小的重要意义。
    令人注意的是，纲领草案中对苏联和其他社会主义国家外交政策的攻击，同南斯拉夫总统约瑟夫·布罗兹·铁托在南斯拉夫政府代表团从莫斯科归国后于1956年6月28日在贝尔格莱德群众大会上所说的话是矛盾的。他当时说，“从宣言中有关国际问题的部分可以看出，在有关巩固和平和国际合作、各国和各国人民间的关系、有关社会制度不同的国家的和平共处的许多极其重要的问题方面，我们的观点是相同的”。铁托同志恳切地说，“苏联人民珍爱和平甚于一切，苏联高级领导人也跟人民一样有这种愿望。”
    不能认为南共纲领草案中提出的国际关系的新结构是正确的，这个草案把社会主义阵营的外交政策同帝国主义阵营的外交政策混为一谈了。
    苏联同其他社会主义国家紧密合作，同世界上一切爱好和平的人民肩并肩地尽最大力量来防止新战争。最近一段时间，苏联提出了许多建设性的新建议，采取了一系列外交步骤，目的是要缓和国际紧张局势、制止军备竞赛、禁止核武器。不久以前，苏联最高苏维埃作出了关于苏联单方面停止原子武器和氢武器试验的决议。苏联最高苏维埃呼吁美国和英国也仿效苏联的榜样。苏联的建议还没有得到美国和其他西方国家统治集团的积极对待，这难道也怪苏联吗？西方国家不愿意仿效苏联的榜样，不愿意停止试验原子武器和氢武器，这难道也怪苏联吗？苏联、中华人民共和国和社会主义阵营其他国家意识到它们所肩负的历史使命，正在坚定不移地实行维护和平和各国人民安全的政策。
    南共纲领草案的起草人在谈到苏联和其他社会主义国家社会主义发展的经验时承认，这“对于国际社会主义来说，都是宝贵经验。”草案中指出了苏联作为给其他国家树立了社会进步发展范例的第一个社会主义国家的历史作用。草案中谈到了苏联在建设工业基地和在进一步发展社会主义关系方面的巨大成就，这种成就使苏联有可能在第二次世界大战中同反希特勒同盟的其他国家合作，战胜法西斯势力集团。
    草案起草人固然指出了工业化方面的成就，但是却完全避而不谈苏联在对于无产阶级专政说来是极其主要和极其复杂的一个社会主义建设问题——把数百万农民群众，个体的、私有的小农经济引上社会主义发展道路的问题——上的经验。难道这个问题不是摆在走上了社会主义建设道路的一切国家的面前的吗？既然在总结社会主义建设的经验，那末，怎么能够不考虑苏联集体农庄建设的最丰富的经验呢？
    应该说，整个南共纲领草案对苏联所走过的历史道路作了极其偏颇的、片面的阐述。在草案中关于中华人民共和国和其他人民民主主义国家的社会主义建设经验没有作应有的阐述。
    大家都知道，苏联和其他社会主义国家的经验完全证实了马克思列宁主义理论下列论点的正确性：社会主义革命和社会主义建设的过程是以走上社会主义道路的一切国家所固有的一些主要规律为基础的。遗憾的是，在纲领草案中没有注意到社会主义发展的普遍规律。相反地，在纲领草案中却把注意力主要集中在苏联过去的缺点和错误上；这些缺点和错误被草案起草人说成是某种“官僚主义—国家主义倾向”，所谓“官僚主义—国家主义倾向”就是指有人想把国家机构变为“社会的主人”。
    草案起草人在批评有人企图“在理论上和思想上为个人崇拜辩解”的幌子下来责备苏联共产党人，说他们对马克思列宁主义的重要原则、首先是马克思列宁主义关于国家和法制的理论作了修正。他们写道：“马克思列宁主义关于无产阶级专政的理论（也就是关于逐渐消亡的国家和工人阶级在摧毁资本主义经济基础和建立社会主义社会关系自由发展的政治、物质条件过程中的斗争工具的理论）变成了斯大林的关于国家的理论，即国家不在消亡、而必须在社会生活的各个领域里日益加强，在社会主义建设中给了国家机器太大的作用，而这种作用迟早必然会开始妨碍社会主义的社会因素和经济因素的发展。”
    可以完全肯定地说：所有这些说法歪曲了苏联的社会生活和理论思想的发展过程。
    说斯大林认为国家不会消亡，认为应该在社会生活的一切方面不断地加强国家，这种说法是不正确的。斯大林关于国家问题、关于无产阶级专政问题的观点反映了马克思列宁主义的观点。斯大林以一个马克思主义者应有的态度，是在发展中来研究社会主义国家的。他根本就没有认为，社会主义国家的形式是永久不变的，社会主义国家最初的一切职能都将长此保存。随着社会主义的胜利，苏维埃社会主义国家的形式和职能都大大改变了。在谈到这些变化的时候，斯大林说：“在国内实行武力镇压的职能已经消失了，消亡了，因为剥削制已被消灭了，剥削者已不存在了，再没有什么人必须加以镇压了。”（“列宁主义问题”第11版第645页）
    斯大林不止一次地讲过：在共产主义社会里，是不会有国家权力的，国家到那时候是要消亡的，斯大林的这些话是大家都知道的。在苏共第十八次党代表大会上，他再一次说明了：到了共产主义社会，如果资本主义包围不存在了，如果外来的军事侵犯的危险消除了，国家就要消失；到了共产主义社会，只是当资本主义包围还存在的时候，当外来的军事侵犯的危险还没有消除的时候，才需要暂时保留国家。
    南共纲领草案的起草人在谈到国家问题的时候，也如同谈到其他许多问题的时候一样，是很明显地不合乎逻辑的。草案说得对：应该反对无政府主义者低估国家的倾向，国家是破坏资本主义制度经济基础和奠定社会主义建设基础的最重要的、必要的杠杆之一。可是，应该指出，他们承认社会主义国家的重要作用以及反对无政府主义者低估国家权力的作法，看来只不过是留一个退身步而已，因为他们强调地提出国家消亡的论点，认为这是今天的直接的、主要的任务。
    草案起草人把国家在共产主义社会以前还必须存在的看法说成是“对马克思主义作国家主义—实用主义的修正”，他们说：“因此，在工人阶级和全体劳动人民的政权巩固后，国家逐步消亡的问题就成为社会主义社会制度基本的和具有决定意义的问题了。”
    既然纲领草案的起草人指责别人对马克思列宁主义关于国家问题的原则作了修正，因此我们不得不叙述一下科学共产主义奠基人关于国家、关于无产阶级专政问题的观点。
    承认在胜利了的社会主义发展为完全的共产主义以前国家应当存在，是马克思列宁主义的基石。列宁不止一次地说，为了国家的完全消亡，需要完全的共产主义。
    一些国家的修正主义分子近来在批判“斯大林主义”的幌子下，就列宁、列宁主义对无产阶级专政的态度散布了歪曲的、虚伪的观念。他们简直把列宁描写成一个自由主义者、无产阶级专政的反对者。然而谁都知道，正是列宁全面地拟定了关于在从资本主义向社会主义的过渡时期中阶级斗争的学说、关于无产阶级专政的学说。
    历史经验证实了列宁的下列论点：在从资本主义向社会主义过渡的时期中，阶级斗争没有停止，而是采取了新的形式。大家知道，被推翻的剥削阶级的反抗形式是多种多样的：阴谋、怠工、反社会主义宣传和诬蔑、对小资产阶级的影响、最后还有对无产阶级专政的武装进攻。进行这种反抗的既有国内的剥削阶级残余，也有逃亡的资本家和地主以及国际反动派。
    工人阶级希望尽可能和平地、无痛苦地过渡到社会主义。这是可以理解的，因为阶级斗争的尖锐化招致巨大的牺牲、生产力的破坏、经济困难、崩溃和劳动人民的贫穷困苦。但是，如果工人阶级完全指望地主和资本家和平让出政权与生产资料的所有权，如果他们不对被推翻的剥削阶级的反抗进行镇压，那末他们就不得不放弃社会主义。
    由于社会主义在苏联的胜利，世界社会主义体系的形成，全世界工人运动和民族解放运动的壮大，目前有较良好的条件可以比较和平地、无痛苦地过渡到社会主义。中国和其他人民民主国家社会主义建设的丰富经验鲜明地显示了社会主义发展的这种新的可能性的意义。但是，这完全不等于说，在向社会主义过渡中，敌对分子就不会加强反抗了，阶级斗争就不会尖锐化了。不能撇开国际局势不问，不能忘记，我们是生活在社会主义和资本主义两个世界体系并存的环境下，是生活在国际帝国主义对社会主义阵营进行极其尖锐斗争的情况下。譬如，1956年的匈牙利事件提醒我们，就是在今天，在正在从资本主义向社会主义过渡的各国，要是无产阶级专政削弱，就有可能发生反革命挑衅和骚动。只要还存在着剥削阶级的残余，只要他们还有一点点希望能依靠小资产阶级分子的支持，就会有反革命活动加强的危险，这种活动会受到国际帝国主义的激励，并得到它的直接支持。
    南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案的起草人，对国家消亡问题的提法，没有考虑到各个社会主义国家发展的经验和现今国际局势的性质，对帝国主义侵略社会主义国家的危险估计不足，对从资本主义向社会主义过渡时期条件下的阶级矛盾的危险也估计不足。
    草案中列举了过渡时期社会发展中的许多矛盾，但是没有突出其中的主要矛盾，即不断生长的社会主义力量和腐朽的资本主义力量之间的矛盾。这个主要矛盾被掩盖、甚至消失在纲领草案罗罗嗦嗦地描写的一大堆其他矛盾中去了。
    此外，这个文件的起草人，不是把工人阶级反对资本主义残余和滋生资本主义的小私有者自发势力的斗争看作基本矛盾，而是如他们所表达的那样，把经济和其他社会职能的管理形式和方法问题，把民主和逐步限制“行政集中领导”问题等等，看作了基本矛盾。他们写道：“解决从资本主义向社会主义过渡时期的矛盾，首先意味着解决这些问题，这就能够保证社会主义建设的各种形式不断前进”。即使承认纲领草案中提出的、我们提到或者没有提到过的一切问题有一定的意义，难道它们就构成过渡时期矛盾的实质吗？
    顺便说说，草案起草人写道，行政集中领导是过渡时期、归根结蒂也就是社会主义本身所固有的矛盾，这是不正确的。大家知道，在社会主义社会中，管理是以民主集中制原则为基础的，这一原则在各个阶段随具体条件而转移，体现在各种不同的组织形式中。对列宁的民主集中制原则的任何曲解绝不是社会主义本身固有的矛盾。
    辩证法教导说，不能把现象中的基本矛盾和非基本矛盾混淆起来。如果在政策中犯了这种混淆的毛病，就可能破坏劳动人民的团结、工人阶级和农民的联盟，从而帮了社会主义敌人的忙。
    历史经验表明，在还存在着剥削阶级和小私有者自发势力的、从资本主义向社会主义过渡的时期，不能把国家消亡的问题作为实践问题提出。
    就是在剥削阶级被消灭后，国家仍然要保存下来，虽然镇压剥削阶级的职能已经消逝。列宁在“国家与革命”中写道：“必须了解，一个阶级底专政不仅为一般阶级社会所必需，不仅为已推翻了资产阶级的那个无产阶级所必需，而且为从资本主义过渡到‘无阶级社会’，过渡到共产主义的整个历史时代所必需，——只有了解了这一点的人，才算是领会了马克思关于国家学说的实质。”（“列宁全集”第25卷，第384—385页）
    为什么国家不能在剥削阶级被消灭后立即消亡呢？
    第一，为了防御帝国主义者的阴谋和军事进攻需要国家，因为帝国主义者没有放松、而且在加紧对社会主义国家的破坏工作。
    社会主义国家主张和平共处和两个对立的社会政治制度展开竞赛，但是，帝国主义侵略集团不放弃用暴力在社会主义国家恢复资产阶级—地主制度、消灭社会主义制度的阴谋。如果缩小和取消国家在国防方面的极重要职能，社会主义国家就会在国际帝国主义面前赤手空拳。
    第二，在社会主义下，工农两个友好阶级之间还有差别，脑力劳动和体力劳动之间的本质差别还没有根除，消费品还不丰足，分配是按照按劳取酬的原则进行的。由此，就必须由社会、由国家对劳动量和消费量严加控制。
    列宁写道：“当社会已实现‘各尽所能，各取所需’的原则时，就是说，当人们已如此习惯于遵守公共生活底基本规则，而他们的劳动生产率已如此发展，致使他们自愿地尽其所能来工作时，国家才会完全消亡。”（“列宁全集”第25卷，第440页）
  第三，在社会主义革命胜利后，民族差别还长期存留着；民族主权不仅不会消亡，而是恰恰相反，真正得到了保障和加强。但是人人知道，民族主权是和国界问题联在一起的。在观察国家命运问题时，不能撇开划定国界的问题。列宁主义教导，胜利了的社会主义在各个方面实行充分的民主化，所以不能拒绝民主地划定国界。要知道，如果没有了国家，也就没有了国界问题。列宁说：“国家‘消亡’了，共和国也将没有了。”（“列宁全集”第22卷，第309页）
    南共纲领草案的起草人谈论了加强国家的独立，而又宣布国家消亡是个实际任务。如果他们是首尾一贯的话，那末就应该提出消除国界的问题。但是，难道有哪一个社会主义国家关于消除国界的问题已经成熟了吗？列宁是完全正确的，他把国家消亡的问题不仅同阶级的完全消失联系起来，而且还同各民族日益紧密的接近和结合这一问题联系起来。
    列宁说：“为了消除民族压迫，必须有一个基础即社会主义生产，但是，在这个基础上还必须有国家的民主组织，民主的军队等等……在这个基础上，首先实际地开始绝对消除民族间各种微小的磨擦，民族间的微小的不信任，在这个基础上各民族尽快地建立接近和结合，这种接近和结合是以国家消亡而完成。”（“列宁全集”第22卷，第311页）
    由此可见，根据列宁的观点来看，各民族的接近和结合不是以国家的消亡开始，而是以国家的消亡来完成的。
    列宁的这些指示在今天仍然有着迫切的意义。大家知道，许多国家只是在走上了社会主义发展道路的时候才取得了本国的民族独立。毫无疑问，将来也只有在社会主义取得更多的成就和资本主义进一步削弱以后，许多国家才能获得民族主权。在这种情况下，提出国家消亡问题，就是取消世世代代处于殖民主义者奴役下的各国人民争取民族主权和保证取得国家独立这一极为重要的问题。
    看来，纲领草案的起草人并没有考虑到国家消亡的根本前提这一问题。他们可能是根据国家的某些职能现在已在消亡这一点，而完全从量的观点来看问题，认为国家职能在量的方面的减少就是国家的完全消亡。
    但是，把国家某些职能的改变和消失这一问题同作为一定社会政治现象的整个国家的消亡混淆起来，是不正确的。社会主义国家根本没有过时，还不能提出国家尽快消亡的课题。社会主义国家是发展社会主义民主的广阔舞台。
    不应该认为，好像可以用这种或那种行政措施、即通过行政命令来加速国家的完全消亡。前面已经说过，国家完全消亡的问题是阶级和阶级差别完全消失的问题，是各民族进一步接近和结合的问题。
    政治就是各阶级之间、各民族之间的关系。这些关系也就是国家结构的范围。可以更换国家机构的名称，可以把它们的职能转交社会团体，但是不论国家机构或国家职能都并不因此而在实质上不再是政治性的了。
    只有在完全的共产主义社会，也就是在阶级消失、脑力劳动和体力劳动的根本差别被消灭、各民族进一步接近和结合的情况下，社会职能才会丧失自己的政治性质，而变为维护社会利益的普通的行政职能。
    要求在党的纲领草案中提出在社会主义改造的第一阶段国家消亡的论点，这在现代共产主义运动中完全不是什么新东西。远在1918年，苏联的某些理论家在讨论俄国共产党（布尔什维克）新党纲草案时就提出过这种要求。当时列宁反对这种要求，列宁说，在理论著作、文章、演讲和讲话中，可以、而且也应当提出这些问题。但是，在纲领中还不能提这些问题。“过早地提出国家消亡，将会破坏历史前景。”（“列宁全集”第27卷，第123页）
    在阅读南共纲领草案时给人一种印象：起草人是以在社会主义制度下国家和民主不相容这一不正确的观念为出发点的。他们显然认为，如果国家不取消和消亡，社会主义民主就不可能得到发展。
    但是，这种观点不符合马克思列宁主义的观点，不符合社会发展过程。不能把社会主义民主同社会主义国家对立起来，不能认为似乎只有国家权力削弱和消亡才可能发展民主。马克思列宁主义经典作家没有把社会主义民主同无产阶级专政对立起来，恰恰相反，他们认为无产阶级专政是民主的最高形式。在“共产党宣言”中把“无产阶级变为统治阶级”和“争取民主”这两个概念并列提出，这决不是偶然的。问题的这种提法很好地说明了从资本主义过渡到共产主义时期国家和民主的相互关系。
    无产阶级专政不是一般的国家，不是少数压迫多数的机器，这是同剥削阶级专政不同的。马克思列宁主义经典作家不止一次地说过，无产阶级专政已经不是原来意义上的国家，因为此时政权是属于社会的大多数、即全体劳动人民的。
    马克思主义奠基人认为，工人阶级国家最重要的特点之一，就是这个国家将是真正民主的国家。马克思强调指出无产阶级专政同人民群众之间的不可分割的联系，他写道：这是“把政权转交人民群众本身，他们用自己的力量把压迫他们的有组织的力量取而代之。”（“马克思和恩格斯文集”，第3卷，第327—329页）
    在草拟纲领草案时，起草人显然没有考虑到国家消亡是一个客观发展的长期过程，扩大社会主义民主决不意味着国家的消亡。当民主最充分的时候，民主本身也将同国家一道都将逐渐消亡。列宁写道：“当然，民主制也是一种国家底形式，它应当随着国家底消灭而消灭，但是这只有在彻底胜利了的和稳固了的社会主义过渡到完全的共产主义时才能达到。”（“列宁全集”第22卷，第132页）后来，列宁解释说，他是有意强调这一原理的，即“民主是一种国家形式，当国家消亡的时候，民主也将消亡。”（“列宁全集”第22卷，第309页）
    纲领草案的起草人反对对国家的偶像崇拜。但是，对于作为一定的国家形式的民主制也不应该有偶像崇拜。马克思主义在发展中考察各种现象，既不崇拜国家，也不崇拜作为国家的一个形式的民主制。
    在南共纲领草案中把关于民主制的发展、关于反官僚主义斗争的问题同国家消亡联系起来。然而，认为似乎只有国家消亡才能克服官僚主义和发展民主，这种看法当然是不正确的。列宁曾经无情地同官僚主义作过斗争，坚决致力于消除这一恶劣现象。但是，他警告不要在向官僚主义作斗争这件事上投机。在讨论工会问题的时期，有些人曾提出“消灭国家官僚主义和国民经济官僚主义”的口号，当时，列宁说，这是一种哗众取宠的说法。他说：“1919年我们在纲领中写道，我们这里有官僚主义。谁要你们消灭官僚主义，谁就是哗众取宠的人。如果有人挺身出来对你们说：‘消灭官僚主义’，那么，这就是哗众取宠的做法。这是无稽之谈。我们将成年累月地同官僚主义作斗争。如果谁不这样看问题，谁就是欺骗，谁就是哗众取宠，因为要打倒官僚主义，需要许许多多措施，需要人人识字，个个有文化，人人都参加工农检查机构。”（“列宁全集”第32卷，第46—47页）
    同官僚主义作斗争意味着更加广泛地吸引群众参加管理。苏联共产党保证群众创造性地讨论一切切身的重大问题，竭力提高劳动人民的主动性和积极性。在拟定和讨论各种法案、国家预算、国民经济计划和各个企业的计划中，在制定工业、住宅和文化建设的措施中，在解决管理国民经济的问题中，都有由选举产生的国家政权机关和社会团体的代表、广大人民群众、千百万劳动人民积极参加。列宁正是这样理解社会主义民主的实质的：随着社会主义民主的发展，群众越来越广泛地参加国家管理，参加讨论和实际执行政治任务和经济任务。列宁写道：“民主的组织原则……意味着每一个群众的代表、每一个公民都应该处于这样的条件中，使他们既能够参加讨论国家的法律，也能够选举自己的代表，又能够执行国家的法律。”（“列宁全集”第27卷，第185页）
    南共纲领草案的起草人在批评“党政不分”的口号下，实际上走上了否定工人阶级政党在社会主义国家的领导作用的道路。他们认为党应该只是一个“思想因素”、“发展社会主义意识的因素”，但是应该不再是“政治因素”、“政权因素”。
    在社会主义国家，思想一致的共产主义者的战斗组织——革命的工人阶级政党是主导力量和指导力量。我国的工人阶级和人民民主国家的工人阶级只有在自己的队伍中保持最严格的集中制和纪律的情况下，才可能战胜资产阶级，才可能引导所有的劳动群众跟着自己走。这种纪律性和组织性是由这样一些因素形成并加以维持的，即无产阶级先锋队的觉悟、它对社会主义事业的忠诚、它的勇敢刚毅不拔的精神、同群众不可分割的联系和正确的政治领导。
    工人阶级政党的使命是教育和团结无产阶级和一切劳动人民中的非党群众，反对小资产阶级的动摇性和影响，在政治上领导无产阶级的整个活动，并通过他们来领导全体劳动群众。
    有些理论家硬说，承认党在工人阶级对社会进行社会主义改造的斗争中的领导作用，是违背马克思主义关于社会发展的客观规律的学说的，这种论调是完全不正确的。共产党人并不把自己的活动跟社会发展的客观规律对立起来，而是研究这种客观规律，总结革命实践。他们依循的不是主观愿望和看法，而是客观的真理。
    贬低党对非党工人群众和所有劳动人民的领导作用和组织作用，是对科学共产主义的背离，是自发性和放任自流的“理论”和实践的表现。没有一个团结一致的、在斗争中经过锻炼的党，工人阶级就不可能对社会实现政权领导，不可能制定并实行社会主义国家的政策，不可能引导一切国家机构和劳动人民社会团体的活动为一致的目标——为共产主义的胜利而奋斗。列宁教导说：“党——这是无产阶级直接掌权的先锋队，是领导者。”（“列宁全集”第32卷，第76页）
    由此可见，南共纲领草案的起草人指责对马克思列宁主义作“实用主义—国家主义”的修正，实际上他们自己离开了马克思主义关于无产阶级专政、关于国家消亡、关于共产党作用的基本论点。
    由于最近几十年世界上发生了深刻的进步的变化，无产阶级国际主义思想的作用大大地增加了。马克思列宁主义政党十分重视加强劳动人民的国际团结，十分重视民族任务和国际主义任务的正确结合。
    在南共纲领草案中有不少篇幅研究这些问题。其中说到，南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟“在自己的队伍中发扬无产阶级国际主义思想并以它的精神教育南斯拉夫劳动群众”。草案中有一些无可争论的论点。但是这个草案中对无产阶级国际主义实质的说明、对社会主义国家关系的说明，以及对草案起草人认为共产党在彼此关系中和社会主义国家关系中所应该努力实现的目标和任务的说明，是片面的，是同世界共产主义运动中所确认的观点相违背的。
    列宁写道：“真正的国际主义，只有一种：这就是竭诚工作来发展本国的革命运动和革命斗争，毫不除外地帮助（以宣传、同情和物质来帮助）所有各国中同样的斗争，同样的路线，而且只帮助这种斗争和这种路线”。（“列宁全集”第24卷，第54页）
    当存在着社会主义世界体系的时候，当国际工人运动和共产主义运动成长壮大的时候，当各国人民的民族解放运动声势浩大的时候，在当前这样一些条件下，无产阶级国际主义的具体表现是什么呢？这就是：支持社会主义世界体系，资本主义世界的工人运动支持苏联、中华人民共和国和其他社会主义国家，而社会主义国家的劳动人民也支持资本主义世界的工人运动，所有国家的共产党团结一致，支持为民族独立、为反对帝国主义而斗争的各国人民。我们时代的无产阶级国际主义的理论和实践中的新东西就是：它一方面还保留着作为国际工人运动原则的全部意义，同时也构成已经摆脱了资本主义枷锁、走上了建设社会主义社会的道路的各国之间关系的基础。这些国家彼此间建立了平等的、充满同志互助的政治、经济和文化关系，交流生产经验和科学技术成就。
    正是社会主义国家的这种互助合作没有在纲领草案中得到反映，而这种互助合作是无产阶级国际主义在这些国家关系中主要的、基本的表现。根据草案中的观点，社会主义国家相互关系的国际主义性质仅仅表现为遵守平等和互不干涉内政的原则。
    无需争论，这是非常重要的原则。马克思列宁主义者始终不渝地要求并且力争各民族和国家的绝对平等，尊重各国人民的权利、他们正当的利益、他们的民族传统、感情、文化。而草案起草人的观点同国际共产主义工人运动中公认的观点之间的分歧的实质，并不在于是不是需要严格遵循平等的原则。这种分歧的实质在于，在纲领草案中，无产阶级国际主义仅仅被归结为平等和不干涉内政的原则，而加强社会主义国家和马克思列宁主义政党的团结和合作的必要性则被置诸脑后了。
    要求承认民族平等也是小资产阶级民族主义的特点。正像列宁指出的那样，它宣布，承认各民族的平等就是国际主义，而就连这一点也纯粹是停留在口头上，事实上却完整地保留着民族利己主义。列宁解释说，在无产阶级专政即将在一些国家中建立起来并且将能够对全世界的政治起决定性的影响的情况下，同小资产阶级根深蒂固的民族主义成见进行斗争就将特别迫切、紧急。无产阶级国际主义在某种情况下要求一个国家的无产阶级斗争的利益服从世界规模的这种斗争的利益。
    然而，在南共纲领草案中只讲到，社会主义国家之间的关系“必须建立在独立、完全平等和尊重每个国家特点等原则上”。
    争取在社会主义国家和无产阶级政党相互关系中确立这些原则的斗争，实质上在纲领草案中被认为是国际主义的唯一的问题，是“社会主义国家和社会主义运动相互关系的最高目的”。
    人们不禁完全有根据地问：平等和不干涉的原则能不能表示社会主义各国关系的全部实质。不，不可能。这些国家的政权属于劳动人民，它们的命运由社会制度和国家制度、利益和目的的共同性紧紧地相互联系起来，它们在相互关系中严格遵守以兄弟般的相互帮助、支持和合作为基础的平等原则。它们中间每一个国家都力求在建设社会主义社会方面给兄弟国家全面的帮助和支持，同时本身又倚靠它们的帮助和支持。在这当中，平等的原则决没有被违反：社会主义的相互帮助就其本质来说排除了一个国家占优势而损害另一个国家利益的可能性。恰恰相反，它促进共同的提高，更加充分地发挥在社会主义大家庭中的每一国人民的物质和精神力量，并且加强了这整个大家庭的力量。
    南共纲领草案起草人提到在社会主义国家关系中会发生破坏社会主义原则的事，企图以此来支持他们对无产阶级国际主义的片面理解。他们写道，“实践表明，或者由于强大的国际政治地位，或者由于经济发展的不同程度，有可能产生这种情况：一个社会主义国家会以种种不同的方法维持同另一个或其他一些社会主义国家的不平等关系。”
    这种说法是没有任何根据的。社会主义国家相互关系的实践，纲领草案起草人所提到的实践，恰恰反驳这种说法。这种实践证明，在社会主义制度下，各国人民的合作由于它本身的性质不会使平等和独立遭到破坏。社会主义国家是真正自主、独立的。
    安排社会主义国家间的关系是十分复杂的、历史上完全新的事情，的确，在这件事情上犯过个别的缺点和错误。但是大家知道，这些缺点和错误已经是历史了，它们已经被坚决地消除了。即使在它们存在的时候，它们也不是社会主义国家之间的关系的实质，这些关系实质上是真正社会主义的、国际主义的。
    马克思列宁主义政党一贯遵循无产阶级国际主义的原则。苏共第二十次代表大会再次肯定始终不渝地执行列宁主义的平等原则的必要性，强调指出考虑社会主义各国历史和民族特点的重要性。早在代表大会以前，苏联共产党和苏联政府就主动消除过去同南斯拉夫关系方面所犯的错误。但是，纲领草案的起草人援引了社会主义国家相互关系方面过去曾经有过的缺点和错误，实质上把这种相互关系的全部经验都否定了，漠视这方面的基本的、主要的东西——国际主义性质，兄弟般的互相帮助和合作。
    南共纲领草案中所使用的名词“思想垄断”和“政治霸权”实质上是反对社会主义革命和社会主义建设的共同原则和共同规律性，因此是反对国际共产主义运动思想上和政治上的团结的。南共中央纲领起草委员会企图以它起草的草案的全部内容来驳倒已经由实践肯定了的马克思列宁主义关于一切国家向社会主义发展的共同规律（同时其中每一个国家都考虑自己的历史和民族特点来解决社会主义改造的具体问题）的原理。根据草案表示的观点，每个国家应当通过自己特殊的道路向社会主义前进，完全从它固有的特殊的条件出发，不注意正在建设社会主义的各国所具备的共同点。草案实际上袒护“民族共产主义”，大家知道，民族共产主义强调社会主义建设方面的民族特点，同时否认社会主义各国经验中显示的主要的、具有普遍意义的东西。这个文件把对“民族共产主义”思想的批判说成是“教条主义观念或大国利己主义观念的结果，或者是资产阶级思想影响或阴谋的结果”。
    在社会主义革命和社会主义建设的根本问题上，有着共同的马克思列宁主义的观点，这种观点反映在社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表的宣言中，并且得到资本主义各国共产党的赞同。南共纲领草案的起草人拚命把这一总结现代社会发展全部经验的观点同自己杜撰的概念对立起来。究竟谁在力图“思想垄断”？如果所有兄弟党持有统一的思想，就不存在它们中间任何一个党“思想垄断”的问题。
    各国马克思列宁主义政党思想上的一致会不会降低各国党的独立性呢？不会，一点也不会。各国兄弟党思想上的一致和相互支持是各国党胜利完成民族任务和国际任务、顺利履行各国党对本国工人阶级和本国人民所承担的义务的最重要的条件。如果哪个党竟要走上同世界共产主义运动不同的思想立场，那末它就有离开正确路线、脱离世界共产主义运动、孤立自己的危险。
    在著名的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议宣言中，极力强调了巩固各国马克思列宁主义政党团结的重要性，这些政党对于世界社会主义体系和国际共产主义运动的命运负有特别重大的历史责任。宣言说：“毫无疑问，为了有效地团结工人阶级，团结全体劳动人民和进步人类，团结全世界爱好自由和和平的力量，必须首先加强共产党和工人党本身的团结，加强各国共产党和工人党之间的团结。这种团结是一切更广泛的团结的核心，是工人阶级事业胜利的最基本的保证”。宣言接着说：“参加会议的各国共产党和工人党声明，为了社会主义各国大家庭的进一步团结的利益，为了国际工人运动以及和平和社会主义事业的利益，它们将始终不渝地加强彼此间的团结和同志式的合作”。
    草案起草人说：“某种思想或某种社会主义建设形式是否正确和是否进步，只取决于它是否具有生命力，是否经得起实践的考验，而并不取决于这个或那个国际中枢的批准。”这种说法自然使人不禁要问：难道马克思列宁主义政党的某种中枢，不是从实践中、从研究理论问题时总结历史经验所产生出来的吗？毫无疑问，这是从革命实践中产生的。当然，各国党历次国际会议的宣言，如果不具有科学的思想，那自然要另作别论。但是，历史并没有提出什么根据来说明各国共产党历次代表大会的决议不正确。马克思列宁主义学说是总结经验、总结国际工人运动的实践、总结全部历史发展的经验所产生的国际学说。这种学说被各国党的集体努力、其中也包括各国党的国际中枢所发展。不能不提一下，科学共产主义的纲领性文件——“共产党宣言”，就是由马克思和恩格斯受国际无产阶级组织“共产主义者联盟”代表大会的委托所起草、并得到了国际工人运动的拥护的。
    由于南共纲领草案起草人谈到工人运动中的所谓“霸权”，我们必须提出以下看法。马克思列宁主义并不否认有这种可能性：某一国共产党，某一个社会主义国家，在一定历史阶段起主导作用。但是，究竟由哪一个党、哪一个国家来领导国际工人运动，这并不取决于任何人的主观愿望，而是取决于客观条件。这具体地决定于以下条件：什么地方是革命运动的中心，什么地方首先实际解决了对社会进行革命改造的迫切任务。
    比如说，十九世纪中叶，革命运动中心是在德国，当时起主导作用的就是德国社会民主党，而德国工人阶级领袖马克思和恩格斯就成为世界无产阶级的领袖，成为科学共产主义的奠基人。十九世纪末二十世纪初，世界革命中心转到了俄国，因此，俄国工人阶级、我国共产党就由于历史发展进程而站到国际工人运动的最前列，而我国共产党的创始人和领袖列宁，也就成为全世界无产阶级所公认的领袖，成为马克思—恩格斯学说和事业的继承人。
    1957年11月所举行的社会主义国家共产党和工人党代表会议的参加者，在所通过的宣言中指出，不可摧毁的社会主义国家阵营是以苏联为首的。这些话反映了苏联在争取社会进步、人民自由和和平事业的斗争中的领导作用，这种作用是历史上形成的事实。
    苏联是第一个无产阶级专政获得了胜利的国家；它开辟了走向社会主义的道路，现在正在解决完成社会主义社会的建设，并逐步过渡到共产主义这一任务。每一个客观的人都不会看不到，国际帝国主义对于一切社会主义国家的打击，主要都是由苏联承担起来的。可以回想一下战后的最初年代。当时帝国主义强国对于年青的、还不巩固的人民民主国家施加了极其巨大的压力，力图干涉它们的内政，来支持剥削阶级，扼杀人民奔向新的社会主义生活的愿望。只是由于苏联的强大，由于它对帝国主义侵略政策的坚决回击，由于所有脱离了资本主义体系的国家的紧密的联盟，这些国家人民的历史果实才得以保全，他们进行建设性劳动的和平条件才得到了保障。1956年秋季，苏联应匈牙利政府的要求，对这个国家的人民给以兄弟般的援助，帮助他们粉碎了霍尔蒂分子、帝国主义代理人所煽动起来的反革命暴乱。把苏联帮助其他国家巩固它们的独立、巩固和发展社会主义果实这种无私的援助称之为“霸权”，这就背离了无产阶级的国际主义。在社会主义阵营中起主导力量的作用，在世界革命运动中起先锋队的作用，同“霸权”毫无共同之点。
    不过，对于社会主义国家的独立的真正威胁是不是存在呢？是存在的。但是这种威胁并不像南共纲领草案所说的那样，是来自“某个社会主义国家”，而是来自国际帝国主义。帝国主义资产阶级对于社会主义国家的诞生，不是用钟声来迎接，而是报之以疯狂的仇恨，在很多情况下还报之以枪炮。在帝国主义者多次企图毁灭和破坏苏维埃国家和人民民主国家之后，在不久前的匈牙利事件以后，大家都很清楚，帝国主义反动派过去和现在，都不甘心于这些国家的存在。帝国主义集团对于社会主义阵营各国所策划的广泛的颠覆活动，是尽人皆知的。
    这一切恰恰雄辩地说明了一点：必需全力巩固社会主义各国人民兄弟般的友谊和团结，使他们的国际主义团结日益成长和发展。社会主义国家紧密的团结和相互支持，这是它们独立的保证，是人民自由、社会进步和世界和平事业的支柱。南共纲领草案中所提出的论点，不能促进社会主义国家团结一致的加强。
    南共纲领草案没有指出社会主义建立了具有世界历史意义的新型国际关系这个事实。而且草案起草人实质上抹煞了这个事实，硬把剥削阶级统治下所产生的一些国际关系的特征加在社会主义身上。
    草案起草人认为一些社会主义国家可能剥削另一些社会主义国家，这种“理论”是奇怪而骇人听闻的。草案起草人认为，在资本主义条件下，比较强大的国家力图取得霸权，统治其他国家人民和建立世界统治，剥削和压迫弱小国家，然后却写道：“类似的倾向在社会主义发展的初期，也是一种经常的危险，这就是说，只要各个国家经济发展的巨大差别还造成各国劳动人民物质状况的极大悬殊，只要个别民族或个别国家由于某种原因而取得的霸权地位还能够对另一些国家使用这种或那种形式的经济剥削，就会存在这种危险。只要存在这种可能性，就会有利用这种可能性的想法和企图。”
    南共纲领草案起草人硬说社会主义国家相互关系中有剥削倾向。这种说法根本违反实际情况，完全是信口雌黄，这点难道不清楚吗？这些说法都是以他们所提出的那种违反客观现实情况的论点为基础的，这种论点就是，似乎存在着“社会主义发展的不平衡性”。这里，草案起草人把帝国主义的发展规律同社会主义的发展规律混为一谈了。大家知道，在帝国主义条件下起作用的是资本主义国家经济和政治不平衡发展的规律。
    在帝国主义条件下，资本主义发展的不平衡性意味着什么呢？这首先意味着，帝国主义国家的发展是跳跃式的、互相冲突的。一些国家赶过另一些国家，排挤掉它们而自己向前发展。与此同时，垄断资本对劳动群众的剥削以及附属国和半附属国遭到的掠夺也随着加强。新兴的国家打败同它竞争的国家，力图扩大势力范围、商品销售市场和原料产地，力图称霸世界。在这种基础上不断发生尖锐的冲突，发生争夺他国领土和奴役各国人民的战争。
    社会主义革命推翻了资本主义，建立了无产阶级专政，随着实行了决定性生产资料的公有化，从而消灭了各国经济和政治不平衡发展规律起作用的基础。与帝国主义条件下资本主义国家发展不平衡性的规律相反，在世界社会主义体系里起作用的是各国匀称、平衡地发展的规律。随着社会主义国家经济实力的增长和社会主义在世界舞台上地位的加强，这种匀称性的意义越来越大。在世界社会主义体系中，由于各国之间实行兄弟互助和合作，在经济和文化方面比较落后的国家能迅速赶上先进的国家，于是就呈现共同繁荣的局面，这正是社会主义的特征。社会主义国家的团结越是巩固，它们的合作越是广泛和完善，那末这种进步的过程也就越是顺利。在社会主义建设的过程中，各国人民历史上遗留下来的经济和文化方面的实际不平等现象迅速地得到克服，各民族和国家的发展水平逐渐趋于平衡。
    譬如苏联，在十月社会主义革命前，俄国中央各省同各民族边区之间的经济和文化发展水平非常悬殊。只过了四十年，从前是民族边区的各苏维埃社会主义共和国，现在在经济和文化水平上已经同俄罗斯联邦并驾齐驱了。它们拥有以现代化技术为基础的高度发达的工业以及大规模的机械化农业。苏联各族人民的文化取得了真正的繁荣。许多在过去甚至没有自己的文字的民族，也在发展着社会主义内容和民族形式的文化、文学和艺术。这一切体现了社会主义的伟大的改造力量，这是苏联共产党和苏维埃国家所执行的列宁主义的真正国际主义政策的结果，是苏联各族人民友好合作的结果。
    苏联、中华人民共和国和其他人民民主国家不断加强它们自己之间的友谊和团结，同时也竭力同其他一切国家扩大经济和文化联系，只要这些国家有这种愿望的话。社会主义阵营国家的团结一致并不是为了反对任何其他国家。但是，这个阵营里的每一个国家都正确地认为，它同社会主义国家的关系应当比同资本主义国家的关系更为密切。
    如果在外交政策方面采取实质上是南共纲领草案所提出的路线，那末就会使社会主义国家互相分离，使它们之间的友谊和团结削弱。毫无疑问，这对各个社会主义国家的独立和整个社会主义事业包藏着严重的危险。
    无产阶级国际主义的原则执行得越加彻底，同沙文主义和民族主义斗争得越加坚决，那末各个社会主义国家之间和各国共产党和工人党之间的团结也就越加巩固。列宁特别注意必需同那种在漂亮动听的借口下鼓吹分裂工人阶级的非常巧妙的民族主义作斗争。列宁写道：
  “有觉悟的工人竭尽一切力量反击各种民族主义，无论是粗野的、强暴的、黑帮派的民族主义，或是那种最巧妙的鼓吹各民族一律平等……同时却按民族来分裂工人的事业，工人的组织和工人运动的民族主义”。（“列宁全集”第20卷，第266页）
    本文涉及南共纲领草案中所提的一些本质问题。对草案中提出的论点进行分析后可以得出这样一个结论：这个文件的起草人虽然说是想“丰富全人类共同的社会主义宝库”，但其实是在其中插入了许多同马克思列宁主义格格不入的主张。
    在这方面，纲领草案起草人竟敢硬说什么“近几十年来马克思主义思想落后于现代社会的发展了”。
    在目前，当马克思列宁主义思想掌握了千百万人的心灵，当差不多占人类三分之一的人口在马克思列宁主义的旗帜下建设社会主义社会，当社会主义取得具有世界历史意义的胜利，当社会主义建设已经不是摸索前进、而得到了在社会主义建设过程中不断丰富起来的马克思列宁主义思想的光辉照耀，当这样的时候，听到有人说马克思列宁主义思想“落后”的这种论调，是令人奇怪的。苏联共产党第二十次代表大会、中国共产党第八次代表大会和其他马克思列宁主义政党的决议中对当代社会发展的原则性问题做了阐述，这种阐述极其令人信服地证明了马克思列宁主义思想的蓬勃发展！1957年秋天在莫斯科举行的共产党和工人党代表会议作出了具有巨大意义的理论总结。
    资产阶级宣传机关抓住了纲领草案中同共产主义的思想原则相矛盾的论点来达到他们自己的目的。他们拚命阿谀纲领草案的起草人，赞扬纲领草案，说它提出了
  “同莫斯科路线有原则分歧的广博的理论论据”，说它“再次提出了1956年秋天同克里姆林宫引起尖锐纠纷的思想观点”。但是大家早就知道，资产阶级宣传机关进攻“莫斯科路线”和“克里姆林宫”，所指的是整个国际共产主义运动的路线。资产阶级宣传机关在妄想削弱国际共产主义运动方面一向是错误的，这一次也一定要犯错误。
    南共纲领草案以总结的形式反映了不是现在才出现的南斯拉夫同志同国际共产主义运动的分歧。纲领草案表明，在许多重要的问题上，这些分歧仍然存在。
    大家知道，为了和平和社会主义事业，苏联共产党和其他兄弟党最近几年来作了许多努力，以便在马克思列宁主义原则的基础上同南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟相接近。在这方面，苏联共产党一贯根据这样一个出发点，即这种接近不能靠牺牲马克思列宁主义原则而作的让步来取得。现在，当南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟纲领草案在一系列极重要的问题上显然背离了马克思列宁主义理论基础的时候，就不能再保持沉默，不能不提出同志式的原则性批评。
    当然，党的同志式的批评不应该成为我们两党和两国间的友好关系继续发展的障碍。
    南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟中央委员会纲领起草委员会正在继续进行改进草案的工作。我们衷心希望南斯拉夫同志在这件大事上取得成就。我们希望，新的草案能完全建立在马克思列宁主义的原则上，从而符合南斯拉夫共产主义者联盟和南斯拉夫人民的利益，有利于加强兄弟社会主义国家、兄弟共产党和工人党之间的团结，有利于和平、民主和社会主义。这样的纲领草案必能使所有的共产党人都深深感到满意。
