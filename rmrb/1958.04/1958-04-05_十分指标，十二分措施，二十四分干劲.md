    The twenty-three townships of Changshu County, Jiangsu Province, recently issued a proposal to launch a socialist agricultural high-yield competition. In this proposal, they put forward a noteworthy slogan: "Ten-point targets, twelve-point measures, twenty-four-point effort." This slogan is vivid and powerful, and in line with the actual needs of the current movement's development. Because planning targets are the goals people strive for; and to achieve these goals, there must be practical and reliable measures to ensure that everyone has the means and confidence to fully exert their efforts and leap forward towards the set goals. If the target equals ten points, then to fully achieve this ten-point target, twelve points of measures are needed as a guarantee. Because various measures may not be fully effective, some may not be fully implemented, and some may not be fully effective even if fully implemented, and there may even be failures due to unforeseen reasons, so the measures must exceed the target. As for the enthusiasm of the masses, the more fully mobilized, the better. Go all out, aim high, and build socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results – this is our slogan.
    All leap forward plans should be based on a concrete analysis of subjective and objective conditions, and be achievable through subjective effort. Advanced plans must have advanced targets. Advanced targets are essential; they are the guidelines for leading people forward. With them, people will be encouraged and will go forward to the ideal goal. Without such advanced targets, but only ordinary or even backward targets, people will be sluggish and weak, their spirits will not be liberated, and they will be in a state of servile inertia, afraid to look high or go far, and no construction undertaking will achieve satisfactory results. Therefore, if we want to leap forward, it is first necessary to propose advanced, not backward and conservative, targets.
    With advanced targets, there must of course be various specific measures as a guarantee. Measures are the specific ways to achieve the targets. Whether there are measures and whether the measures are correct directly determine the success or failure of the plan.
    With advanced targets and specific measures to achieve them, the enthusiasm of the masses will have a place to be used, will not be in vain, and will be able to make due achievements.
    Recently, some places have proposed advanced targets and have sufficient enthusiasm, but lack specific methods, which poses a danger of the targets failing or not being fully realized. Therefore, after the targets are set, it is necessary to immediately mobilize the masses to make it their own business, pool their wisdom and efforts, and determine all the necessary specific measures to solve the various difficulties and problems encountered in the process of achieving the targets. No difficulty is absolutely insurmountable; the difficulty itself contains the factors to overcome it. The question is whether we can make a concrete analysis of the specific situation, discover the factors to overcome the difficulty, and find a solution from the difficulty.
    For example, the ten agricultural cooperatives in Malou Township, Lushan County, Henan Province, needed a total of 903,250 workdays in February to achieve various targets such as mountain management, water management, and land cultivation, while the entire township had only 10,758 laborers. Each person had to do more than 80 workdays in one month to complete the task, which created a contradiction between large tasks, tight schedules, and insufficient labor. Faced with this situation, two ideological sentiments emerged among the township and cooperative cadres: one was to grit their teeth and fight hard to overcome the difficulties and resolutely complete the task; the other was to fear the difficulties and demand a reduction in the task. Finally, all the cadres and masses in the township studied and came up with ten methods to complete the task (the improvement and creation of new tools alone, especially the rapid soil transportation machine in this item, enabled one person to do the work of thirty people), thus smoothly resolving the contradiction. This example shows that as long as we not only have leap forward targets, but also reliable measures to achieve the leap forward targets, coupled with the enthusiasm of the broad masses, working hard and practically, our socialist construction cause will truly usher in a comprehensive leap forward.
    At present, in the process of formulating plans, we see two kinds of thinking methods. One is to proceed from objective reality, grasp the objective laws of the development of things, see both the prospects for the development of things and the current objective conditions – favorable and unfavorable conditions, and at the same time fully estimate the subjective initiative of the people, and make realistic, fast, good, and economical plans. This is a dialectical materialist way of thinking. Plans made using this method have the possibility of doing things well and promoting the development of production. The other method is just the opposite, which is a one-sided subjectivist way of thinking. It only sees local phenomena and not the whole picture, so it cannot correctly make its own plans based on objective facts. Such a plan will inevitably delay and hinder the development of production.
    The one-sided subjectivist way of thinking appears in two forms in the formulation of production and construction plans. First, there are the conservatives, as we often say, who only see the difficult side when formulating any plan, and not the favorable side, and only emphasize negative factors such as "backwardness," "poor conditions," and "weak foundation," and underestimate the enthusiasm and creativity of the people in building socialism. They do not understand that negative factors can be transformed into positive factors, so they are often frightened by difficulties and lose the courage to strive for the upstream. In this way, they dare not do things that could have been done with effort. The planning targets formulated by these conservatives will naturally not be advanced targets. Second, most of them can be called daydreamers with good wishes. These daydreamers often regard fantasies as reality, only satisfying themselves with empty talk about advanced targets, without proposing or being unable to propose certain measures to guarantee the realization of the targets. These daydreamers and conservatives are all subjectivists divorced from reality. These two kinds of one-sided subjectivist thinking are extremely harmful to socialist construction.
    Facts are ruthless for those with conservative ideas. In the past few years, our socialist construction, whether it is the development of industrial production or the development of agricultural production, especially the production and construction upsurge that has been set off by the people of the whole country in a surging momentum, has been hitting those with conservative ideas one blow after another. This proves that their thinking is completely wrong. They should catch up quickly and make their thinking keep up with the process of objective reality, and do not stubbornly drag objective reality backward to make it conform to their backward thinking. In the current situation where the people of the whole country are competing to be advanced, catch up with the advanced, boost their energy, aim high, and set off an upsurge in building socialism with greater, faster, better, and more economical results, although conservative thinking has no place to stand in fact, we still cannot relax our vigilance against it at all times, especially when formulating or revising plans and targets.
    On the other hand, we have always opposed empty talk and empty boasting. We advocate practical work and practical shouting, that is to say, our work must be done down-to-earth, and the slogans we shout must be based on the actual conditions that can be achieved by subjective and objective conditions. We advocate looking at the long term and starting from the near term, targets plus measures, measures plus enthusiasm, to overcome all the difficulties on the road to progress with overwhelming courage, and strive for the realization of the plan.
    Now our country's socialist construction is in a great leap forward. The power of the awakened people can make high mountains bow their heads, rivers make way, and make many unprecedented miracles. But in order to achieve all this, we must not only dare to think and dare to do, but also come up with practical and effective measures. If all these measures are effectively implemented, not only will the plan be completed, but it can also be greatly overfulfilled. Only in this way will the enthusiasm and confidence of the masses not be damaged, and our cause will continue to advance and advance. Therefore, we hope that all places in the country will implement the comrades' slogan in Changshu County: ten-point targets, twelve-point measures, and twenty-four-point effort!

### 十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲

    十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲
    最近江苏省常熟县二十三个乡发出了开展社会主义农业高额丰产竞赛的倡议书，在这个倡议书中，他们提出了一个值得注意的口号：“十分指标，十二分措施，二十四分干劲。”这个口号生动有力，切合当前运动发展的实际需要。因为规划指标是人们努力奋斗的目标；而要实现这种目标，还必须有切实可靠的措施，使人人都有办法、有信心，能够充分发挥干劲，大踏步地向着规定的目标跃进。如果说，指标等于十分，那末，为了完全实现这十分指标，就需要有十二分措施做保证。因为各种措施不一定都能不折不扣地收到实效，其中可能有没有充分做到的，也可能有虽然充分做到而没有充分生效的，甚至还可能有由于没有预见到的原因而失败的，所以措施必须超过指标。至于群众的干劲，那自然要鼓得越足越好。鼓足干劲，力争上游，多快好省地建设社会主义——这就是我们的口号。
    一切跃进的规划，都应当是对主观和客观的条件加以具体的分析，经过主观的努力而能达到的规划。先进的规划必须有先进的指标。先进的指标是必需的，它是领导人们前进的纲领。有了它，人们就得到鼓舞，就将一往无前地向着理想的目标奔去。如果没有这种先进的指标，而只有通常的甚至落后的指标，那末，人们就一定疲疲沓沓，有气无力，人们的精神就不能解放，处在一种不敢往高处看、不敢往远处走的萎靡不振的奴隶状态，什么建设事业都不会得到满意的成就。因此，我们要跃进，首先有必要提出先进的而不是落后的、保守的指标来。
    有了先进的指标，当然必须有各种具体的措施做保证。措施是实现指标的具体办法。有没有措施和措施是否正确，直接决定着规划的成败。
    有了先进的指标，又有实现指标的具体措施，群众的干劲才有用武之地，才不会落空，才能够做出应有的成绩。
    最近有些地方提出了先进的指标，也有足够的干劲，但缺乏具体的办法，这就有使指标落空或不能完满实现的危险。因此，应当在确定指标以后，立即发动群众，使它变成群众的切身事业，群策群力，定出一切必要的具体的措施来解决实现指标过程中所遇到的各种困难和问题。任何困难都不是绝对不可克服的，困难本身就包含着克服困难的因素，问题还在于我们是不是能够对具体情况做具体分析，发现克服困难的因素，从困难中找出办法。
    举例来说，河南省鲁山县马楼乡的十个农业社，在2月间实现治山、治水、刨地等各种指标共需九十万三千二百五十个工，而全乡劳动力只有一万零七百五十八个，在一个月时间内每人要做八十多个工才能完成任务，这就出现了任务大、时间紧、劳力少的矛盾。面对这种情况，在乡社干部中出现了两种思想情绪，一种是要咬牙苦战，突破困难，坚决完成任务；一种是怕困难，要求减少任务。最后，全乡干部和群众研究出了十项完成任务的办法（单是改良和创造新工具一项，单是这一项中的快速运土机，就使一个人能顶三十个人干活），因而顺利地解决了这个矛盾。这个事例表明，只要我们不仅有跃进的指标，而且有实现跃进指标的可靠措施，加上广大群众的干劲，实干苦干，我们的社会主义建设事业就会真正出现一个全面大跃进的局面。
    目前在制定规划的过程中，我们看到有两种思想方法。一种是从客观实际出发，把握事物的客观发展规律，既看到事物发展的远景，也看到目前的客观条件——有利条件和不利条件，同时充分估计人们的主观能动性，做出切合实际的多快好省的计划。这是一种辩证唯物主义的思想方法。用这种方法制定的规划，就有可能把事情办好，促进生产的发展。另一种方法恰好相反，这就是片面的主观主义的思想方法。它只看到局部现象而看不到全面，因而不能正确地从客观事实出发做出自己的计划。这样的计划，必然会延宕、阻碍生产的发展。
    片面的主观主义的思想方法，在制订生产建设的规划上，是以两种姿态出现的。其一，就是我们常说的那种保守主义者，他们在制订任何一种计划的时候，只看到困难的一面，看不到有利的一面，只强调“落后”、“条件不好”、“基础差”等消极的因素，而对人民群众建设社会主义的积极性和创造力估计不足。他们不懂得消极因素可以转化为积极因素，因而他们往往被困难吓倒，丧失力争上游的勇气。这样，本来是经过努力可以做到的事情，他们也不敢动手去做。这些保守主义者制订出来的规划指标，自然不会是先进的指标。其二，多半可以称之为具有美好愿望的空谈家。这种空谈家，常常把幻想当作真实，只满足于空谈先进的指标，而不提出或者提不出一定的措施来保证指标的实现。这种空谈家同保守主义者都是脱离实际的主观主义者。这两种片面的主观主义思想对于社会主义建设都是极端有害的。
    事实对于具有保守思想的人是无情的。几年来我们的社会主义建设事业，无论是工业生产的发展，也无论是农业生产的发展，特别是在近来全国人民以乘风破浪之势所掀起的生产建设高潮，都一棒一棒地打在具有保守思想的人的头上。这证明他们的思想完全错了。他们应该急起直追，使自己的思想赶上客观现实的进程，而不要硬把客观现实拖向后退，使它符合于自己的落后思想。在目前全国人民争相比先进、赶先进、鼓足干劲、力争上游、掀起多快好省的建设社会主义高潮的情况下，保守思想虽然事实上已无容身之地，但是我们仍然不能时刻对它放松警惕，特别是在制订或修订规划和指标的时候。
    另一方面，我们从来也反对说空话，放空炮。我们提倡实干实喊，就是说我们的工作要脚踏实地地干，我们喊出的口号要以主客观条件所能达到的实际为根据。我们提倡从远处着眼，近处着手，指标加措施，措施加干劲，以压倒一切的勇气来克服横在前进路上的一切困难，力争规划的实现。
    现在我国的社会主义建设事业正处在伟大的跃进中。已经觉醒了的人民的力量能使高山低头、河水让路，做出许多前无古人的奇迹。但是为了实现这一切，我们不但要敢于想，敢于干，而且要拿出实际有效的措施，这些措施如果全部有效地实现，不但一定可以完成计划，而且可以大大地超额完成计划。只有这样，群众的热情和信心才不会受到损伤，我们的事业才会不断地前进又前进。因此，我们希望全国一切地方都实行常熟县同志们的口号：十分指标，十二分措施和二十四分干劲！
