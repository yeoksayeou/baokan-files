Xinhua News Agency, Xining, 13th April. To solve the problem of insufficient technical strength in the development of local industry, Qinghai Province's industrial leadership departments have adopted a variety of effective methods. These methods are: 1. Old factories and mines run training classes, with veteran workers mentoring apprentices; 2. Studying in other provinces, entrusting brother factories and mines to provide training; 3. Borrowing from other places; 4. Running spare-time cultural and technical schools; 5. Establishing industrial colleges and secondary industrial schools, and so on.

This year, Qinghai Province has successively held four training classes in fertilizer manufacturing, dairy processing, agricultural and animal husbandry machinery manufacturing and repair, and power generation, with a total of more than 500 technical personnel trained in the first phase. These training classes are all held in the original old factories. In order not to delay the farming season, the fertilizer manufacturing training class adopted the method of learning as soon as one arrives. People from various prefectures and counties generally learned the technology of manufacturing mixed fertilizers in three or four days, and returned to participate in the production of newly built fertilizer plants. The training classes for agricultural and animal husbandry machinery manufacturing and repair, power generation, and dairy processing all combined the explanation of theoretical knowledge with practical operation, so learning was very fast. This year, more than 200 personnel have been sent to Lanzhou, Xi'an, Shanghai, Beijing, Hainan Island and other places to study techniques such as wool spinning, coal mine underground ventilation, nitrogen fertilizer manufacturing, and gold smelting. The issue of borrowing technical personnel from outside has also been supported by Anshan Iron and Steel, Beijing Qinghe Woolen Mill, Songjiang Cannery and various factories in Shenyang.

    工业人材在青海生长起来
    新华社西宁13日电　青海省工业领导部门采取多种有效办法，解决发展地方工业中技术力量不足问题。这些办法是：一、老厂矿开办训练班，老工人带徒弟；二、到外省学习，委托兄弟厂矿代训；三、向外地借用；四、举办业余文化技术学校；五、兴办工业专科学校和中等工业学校等等。
    今年青海省已先后举办了肥料制造、乳品加工、农牧机械制造和修理、发电等四个训练班，第一期共培训技术人材五百多人。这些训练班都是在原有的老厂里举办的。肥料制造训练班为了不误农时，采取随到随学的办法。各州、县来学习的人，一般在三、四天内就学会了制造混合肥料的技术，回去就参加新建肥料厂的生产。农牧机械制造和修理、发电、乳品加工等训练班都是讲解理论知识和实际操作相结合，因此学起来很快。今年派到兰州、西安、上海、北京、海南岛等地去学习毛纺织、煤矿井下通风、氮肥制造、黄金冶炼等技术的人员已有二百来人。向外面借用技术人员的问题，也已经得到鞍钢、北京清河制呢厂、松江罐头厂和沈阳各厂的支持。
