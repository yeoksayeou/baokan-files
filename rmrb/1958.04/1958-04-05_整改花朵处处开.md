Rectification Flowers Blooming Everywhere
The Role of Big-Character Posters Is Truly Great
960,000 Meters of Cotton Cloth Find a Home

During the "Double-Anti" campaign, several employees of the Hebei Provincial Textile Products Company posted a big-character poster that read: "Our province uses 984 bundles of yarn annually just for the packaging cloth for cotton yarn and cotton cloth. This packaging cloth is discarded and misused after being transported to sales units, which is a great waste. We suggest implementing a system for recycling packaging cloth."

After this big-character poster was posted, the leadership thought the suggestion was excellent. They immediately consulted with the Industry Department and the Textile Management and Supply and Marketing Bureau to seek their assistance and convened representatives from ten textile factories and four textile product wholesale stations for research. Everyone unanimously agreed to this method and formulated specific measures for the recycling of packaging cloth. The whole province has now universally implemented this method, and it is estimated that 960,000 meters of cotton cloth can be saved annually, which can provide clothing for 160,000 people for a year.

Staying Idle in the City Is Not the Best Policy; Determination to Return Home to Engage in Production

Fang Yingfu, the cousin of Fang Guizhen from No. 19, Lane 25, Puson South Road, Beixinjing Town, Xijiao District, Shanghai, and Quan Ming, the younger brother of Quan Hong from No. 19, Lane 112, were both temporary residents. Quan Ming was originally a farmer in Taizhou and came to Shanghai four months ago to learn leatherwork from his brother. Because he didn't have food coupons, he had to queue up at nearby snack shops every day to buy cooked food. Fang Yingfu's home was in Yancheng, and he was also a farmer. He came to Shanghai during the Spring Festival to set up a stall and do business with his sister, but doing business was not necessarily profitable, and life was not stable. During the rectification campaign in the neighborhood, they realized that people from the countryside should not linger in Shanghai, so they have both decided to return to their hometowns in northern Jiangsu in early April.

Spring Colors Fill the Streets
"A great thunderstorm, spring colors fill the streets" has become a vivid portrayal of the street rectification movement in Fuzhou, Fujian Province.

In recent days, rectification columns have appeared on all streets. The columns are filled with big-character posters of self-criticism from grassroots cadres, responses from various agencies, as well as self-examinations and pledges from some residents. During the days when big-character posters flooded the streets, representatives from various agencies came to see them. After taking the big-character posters criticizing their units back, they quickly sent back responses on how to improve their work and swiftly put them into action. The Fuzhou Pot Casting Factory, located on Yangzhong Road, Taijiang District, did not have good "four preventions" (fire prevention, theft prevention, accident prevention, enemy prevention) and sanitation. After seeing the big-character posters from local residents criticizing them, the factory director led the workers every morning to clean up the environment around the factory.

New Township Head Collects Manure
Zhang Zhiheng, the director of the Luan County Finance Bureau, was a heroic soldier in the past. He performed outstanding service twice in the famous Huaihai Campaign. After being transferred to local work in 1955, he retained his heroic spirit, consistently working actively and responsibly, and studying diligently.

On March 1st, the Luan County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party transferred him to Hanjian Township to serve as the township head. As soon as he arrived in the township, he bought a pair of manure baskets. In addition to doing his job, he always got up early and carried manure baskets in the dark. Even when he went to the base points to report on his work or to the county for meetings, he always carried his manure baskets with him. He has already collected more than 3,200 catties of manure.

Under the influence of Comrade Zhang Zhiheng, Zhang Fusheng, the Party branch secretary of the Hanjian Township Agricultural Cooperative, Niu Zhuzhi, the cooperative director, and more than thirty cadres stationed in the township, have also started carrying manure baskets. Comrade Zhang Zhiheng's actions have been commended by the county committee leadership and have been named a model cadre of the county. (Attached image)

专栏：整改花朵处处开

    整改花朵处处开
    大字报的作用真正大
    九十六万公尺棉布有了家
    在双反运动中，河北省纺织品公司的几个职工，贴出了一张大字报，上面写着：我省各地光装棉纱棉布的包皮布一年就得用九百八十四件纱，这些包皮布运到销售单位以后乱扔乱用，这是一笔很大的浪费。建议实行包皮布回收的办法。
    这张大字报贴出以后，领导上认为这个建议很好，立即和工业厅、纺织管理供销局商量，求得他们的协助，召集了十个纺织厂、四个纺织品批发站的代表进行研究。大家一致同意这个办法，并制定了包皮布回收的具体办法。现全省已普遍执行这个办法，预计全年可以节省九十六万公尺棉布，可供十六万人一年的衣着用布。
    闲居城市非上策  决心回乡闹生产
    上海市西郊区北新泾镇蒲松南路二五弄十九号方桂珍的堂弟方应富和一一二弄十九号全洪的弟弟全明，两人都是临时户口。全明本在泰州种田，四个月前到上海，准备跟哥哥学皮匠。因为他没有粮票，每天不得不到附近点心店去排队买熟食品。方应富家在盐城，也是种田的，春节的时候来上海，跟着姊姊摆摊做买卖，可是，做买卖也不一定能赚钱，生活也不安定。这次里弄整风中，他们认识到农村的人不应耽在上海，因此都已决定：4月初保证回苏北家乡去。
    春色满街衢
    “一场大雷雨，春色满街衢”，已成为福建省福州市街道整改运动的生动写照。
    这几天，各街道都出现了整改专栏。在专栏里贴满了基层干部自我批评的大字报，各机关的答复，也贴着一些居民的检讨和保证。在大字报涌上街头的日子里，各机关都派代表来看大字报。他们把批评本单位的大字报领回去后，很快就送来改进工作的答复，并且迅速见诸行动。设在台江区洋中路的福州铸锅厂“四防”和卫生工作都不大好，这次看到当地居民批评他们的大字报后，厂长每天清晨都带领职工在厂的周围打扫环境卫生。
    新乡长拾粪
    潞安县财政局局长张志恒，过去在部队上是个杀敌英雄，曾在著名的淮海战役中，连续立大功两次。1955年转业到地方工作后，他仍不失当年英雄的本色，工作一贯积极负责，刻苦钻研。
    3月1日，中共潞安县委调他到韩店乡担任乡长。他一到乡后就买了一对粪筐，除了干工作外，每天总是起早搭黑背着粪筐拾粪。就是去基点汇报工作、到县上开会，也是粪筐不离身。现在已经拾了三千二百多斤粪。
    在张志恒同志的影响下，韩店乡农业社党支部书记张福生、社主任牛柱只和驻在这个乡的三十多个干部，也都背起了粪筐。张志恒同志这种行动，受到了县委领导上的通报表扬，并且被评为县的模范干部。（附图片）
