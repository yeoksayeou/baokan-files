    Fiberglass Reinforced Plastic
    The Nanjing Plastics Factory has successfully trial-produced a fiberglass reinforced plastic with unique properties. This is another important new product in China's plastics industry.
    Fiberglass reinforced plastic has the characteristics of being non-conductive, resistant to high voltage, heat, acid, and fire, as well as being strong, lightweight, and so on. It can replace non-ferrous metals and low-carbon steel and be used as parts and housings for chemical, electrical, and other scientific instruments. It can also be used as building materials, daily furniture, bridge frames, various molded industrial products, and gas masks. Its use value far exceeds that of currently produced phenolic plastics and cloth-backed plastics.

    Finest Yarn
    The Shanghai State-owned No. 2 Cotton Mill recently spun 150-count cotton yarn using domestically produced Xinjiang improved cotton. This is the finest and highest-grade yarn spun by domestic cotton mills using domestic cotton. The workers of this factory plan to weave this kind of cotton yarn into high-grade poplin as a gift to the "May Day" Labor Day.

    Automatic Silk Loom
    Late on April 18th, China's first automatic silk loom was successfully trial-produced at the Hangzhou Textile Machinery Manufacturing Factory. This type of silk loom does not require manual shuttle changing and can cast the shuttle more than 180 times per minute. It will also automatically stop when the warp and weft threads break.
    The automatic silk loom can be officially put into production in May, and 1,100 units will be manufactured in the second half of the year. Silk workers using this type of silk loom can completely break away from manual operation and greatly improve their tending capacity. (Xinhua News Agency)

    Widescreen Film Projector
    A widescreen stereophonic film projector has been successfully trial-produced at the Harbin Film Machinery Factory. After measurement and testing, this film projector has proven to have good sound and light effects. The factory plans to produce fourteen units this year, which can equip seven widescreen cinemas.

    "Qinchuan Brand" Tractor
    A small tractor with a wide range of uses—the "Qinchuan Brand" tractor—was successfully trial-produced at the State-owned Xi'an Machine Manufacturing Factory on April 21st. This is the first tractor manufactured in the Northwest region.
    This tractor has seven horsepower, can plow about 1.5 mu of land per hour, with a plowing depth of 12 to 16 centimeters. It is powered by a diesel engine, and the fuel consumption for plowing one mu of land is 1.37 kilograms.
    The "Qinchuan Brand" tractor can be used in both dry land and paddy fields, and can travel on narrow roads, making it suitable for use on small plots of land in hilly areas. (Xinhua News Agency)
