Xinhua News Agency, April 25th. The Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic Gymnastics Team, a group of seventeen, arrived in Beijing by plane today. This is their second visit to China since 1956 at our invitation.

    The Russian Gymnastics Team is led by Katayev, Director of the Teaching and Research Office of the Smalensk Institute of Physical Education. The team includes six male athletes and five female athletes. Among them, male athlete Birogov and female athletes Alexandrova, Kukushkina, and Juzeva have visited China in 1956. Female athlete Alexandrova was the all-around gymnastics champion of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic in 1957. In April of this year, she participated in the All-Soviet Gymnastics Championships and won sixth place in the vault. The Russian Gymnastics Team also includes Lisitsky, the youngest member of the Soviet national team. He is only eighteen years old and won fifth place on the horizontal bar in the recent All-Soviet Gymnastics Championships.

    The Russian Gymnastics Team is one of the strongest teams in the Soviet Union. In 1956, when they competed with Chinese gymnasts for the first time in Beijing, they won first place in all events (the men's parallel bars were tied with Chinese athlete Bao Naijian for first place). In 1957, when the Chinese Youth Gymnastics Team visited the Soviet Union, they also held a competition with the Russian Gymnastics Team. At that time, Chinese female athlete Lan Yalan won first place in the all-around event. Male athletes Xu Renjie and Bao Naijian won first place in pommel horse and floor exercise, respectively. The other first places were won by athletes from the Russian team.

    The schedule for the Russian Gymnastics Team to compete with Chinese gymnasts in Beijing has been determined. On the 27th, there will be a competition of compulsory routines (1958 World Gymnastics Championships compulsory routines) for men and women; on the 29th, there will be a competition of optional routines for men and women.

    俄罗斯体操队到京
    新华社25日讯　俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国体操队一行十七人，今天乘飞机到达北京。这是他们继1956年以后第二次应邀来我国访问。
    俄罗斯体操队由斯马连斯基市体育学院教研室主任卡塔耶夫任领队。全队有六名男运动员和五名女运动员。其中男运动员比罗郭夫和女运动员亚历山德洛娃、库库什金娜、巨泽娃等四人，曾在1956年来中国访问。女运动员亚历山德洛娃是1957年俄罗斯苏维埃联邦社会主义共和国的体操绝对冠军。她在今年4月间，参加全苏体操锦标赛中，得到跳马第六名。俄罗斯体操队的男运动员中，还包括有一名最年轻的苏联国家队选手里西斯基。他今年才十八岁，在这次全苏体操锦标赛中得到单杠第五名。
    俄罗斯体操队是苏联的强队之一。1956年他们在北京第一次同我国的体操运动员比赛时，得了全部项目的第一名（其中男子双杠同我国运动员鲍乃健合得第一）。1957年我国青年体操队去苏联访问时，又同俄罗斯体操队举行了比赛。当时，我国女运动员蓝亚兰得到了全能第一名。男运动员徐仁杰、鲍乃健分别得到了鞍马、自由体操的第一名。其他项目的第一名，都由俄罗斯队运动员夺得。
    俄罗斯体操队这次在北京同中国体操运动员比赛的日程已经确定，将在27日举行男子和女子的规定动作（1958年世界体操锦标赛规定动作）比赛；29日举行男子和女子的自选动作比赛。
