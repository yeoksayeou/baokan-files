The United States Must Immediately Stop Using Taiwan to Interfere in Indonesia's Internal Affairs
Commentator of this newspaper

Recent facts revealed from various sources show that the United States is intensifying its interference in Indonesia's internal affairs by using Taiwan, the Chinese territory it occupies. Immediately after the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization's Manila meeting last month, Dulles rushed to Taipei to conspire with the Chiang Kai-shek clique to plot aid to Indonesian rebel activities. Shortly thereafter, American planes taking off from Taiwan continuously airdropped weapons to the rebels in the Central Sumatra rebel area. On March 23 alone, there were two drops. These weapons have been seized by the Indonesian government forces, including mortars, rocket launchers, and automatic rifles, and have been confirmed to be American-made. The United States also "sold" helicopters and ships to the rebels through the Chiang Kai-shek clique's so-called "merchants." At the same time, many Chiang Kai-shek clique soldiers who have received special agent training have illegally infiltrated Indonesia. It is an extremely serious situation that the United States is directing the Chiang Kai-shek clique to interfere so blatantly in Indonesia's internal affairs.

Since the Indonesian government took military action against the rebel group, U.S. imperialism has acted like a bereaved spouse, yelling and screaming, openly expressing its desire to save the rebel group, and interfering through various activities. At the Manila meeting, the United States attempted to instigate the member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization to directly interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs, in order to realize the vicious plot of "using Asians to fight Asians." However, the United States is already so isolated in Asia that even many member states of the Southeast Asia Treaty Organization did not support this conspiracy of the United States. It is under these circumstances that the United States, on the one hand, is putting on a show of force with its Seventh Fleet to intimidate, and on the other hand, has selected the Taiwan Chiang Kai-shek clique as the main tool for interference. The United States wants to use this method to cover up the truth of its direct interference in Indonesia's internal affairs, which is of course futile. It is well known that under the illegal occupation of the United States, our country's territory of Taiwan has become an important base for the United States to carry out aggressive activities in the Far East, and the Chiang Kai-shek clique is nothing more than a group of desperadoes under the protection of American bayonets. The fact that the United States is now using Taiwan to interfere in Indonesia's internal affairs can only show how extremely vicious the United States' aggressive activities in Asia have become!

For the same reason, the United States has recently instructed the Lee Seung-man clique in South Korea to come out and rant, saying that it wants to send an "expeditionary force" to Indonesia to assist the rebels. This is of course not surprising. As the Indonesian "Eastern Star" newspaper said, the U.S. imperialist's servant Lee Seung-man, like Chiang Kai-shek, is doing everything possible to subvert the Indonesian government, all to serve the United States.

This sinful activity of the United States will inevitably make the situation in Indonesia and Asia more serious and complicated. It not only threatens Indonesia's independence and security, but also threatens peace in Asia. Now, the Indonesian people have expressed strong anger and protest against this sinful activity of the United States, and they are resolutely fighting against any interference by the United States.

Our government and people have long pointed out that any further interference by the United States in Indonesia's internal affairs will have serious consequences. Our government and people resolutely oppose the United States' use of Taiwan to expand and intensify its interference in the Republic of Indonesia, fully support the Indonesian government and people's just struggle against foreign interference and subversive activities, and firmly believe that this struggle will surely achieve final victory. The United States must immediately stop this sinful activity that undermines peace in Asia, otherwise it must bear full responsibility for all the consequences arising therefrom.

    美国必须立即停止利用台湾干涉印度尼西亚内政
    本报评论员
    最近，从各方面揭发出来的事实表明，美国正在利用它所霸占的中国领土台湾，加紧干涉印度尼西亚内政。上月东南亚条约组织马尼拉会议刚刚结束后，杜勒斯就匆匆地赶到台北去同蒋介石集团策划援助印度尼西亚叛乱活动的阴谋。此后不久，从台湾起飞的美国飞机就在中苏门答腊叛乱地区接连不断地空投武器给叛乱分子。仅仅在3月23日一天就投了两次。这些武器已被印度尼西亚政府军队缴获，其中包括迫击炮、火箭炮和自动步枪，并且已证实都是美国制造的。美国还通过蒋介石集团的所谓“商人”向叛乱分子“出售”直升飞机和舰艇。同时，许多受过特务训练的蒋介石集团的军人已非法潜入印度尼西亚。美国指使蒋介石集团如此露骨地干涉印度尼西亚内政，这是一个极端严重的情况。
    自从印度尼西亚政府对叛乱集团采取军事行动以来，美帝国主义就如丧?妣，大喊大叫，公开表示要挽救叛乱集团，并且利用各种活动进行干涉。在马尼拉会议上，美国曾企图策动东南亚条约组织的成员国对印度尼西亚内政进行直接干涉，以实现“用亚洲人打亚洲人”的恶毒阴谋。但是，美国在亚洲已经这样孤立，甚至东南亚条约组织的许多成员国也没有支持美国的这个阴谋。正是在这种情况下，美国一方面摆出自己的第七舰队进行恫吓，一方面就选中了台湾蒋介石集团作为干涉的主要工具。美国想用这种办法来掩盖它直接干涉印度尼西亚内政的真相，这当然是徒劳的。人所共知，在美国的非法侵占下，我国领土台湾已成为美国在远东进行侵略活动的重要基地，而蒋介石集团不过是在美国刺刀保护下的一群亡命之徒。美国现在居然利用台湾来干涉印度尼西亚内政，这只能说明美国在亚洲的侵略活动已经到了多么穷凶极恶的地步！
    由于同样的原因，美国最近还指使南朝鲜的李承晚集团也出来狂叫，说什么要派“远征军”去印度尼西亚援助叛乱分子。这当然也没有什么奇怪。正如印度尼西亚“东星报”所说，美帝国主义的仆从李承晚同蒋介石一样，他们想尽一切力量来颠覆印度尼西亚政府，都是为美国效劳而已。
    美国的这种罪恶活动，不可免地将使印度尼西亚和亚洲局势严重化和复杂化。它不仅威胁了印度尼西亚的独立和安全，而且也威胁了亚洲的和平。现在，印度尼西亚人民已经对美国的这种罪恶活动表示了强烈的愤怒和抗议，他们正在为反对美国的任何干涉而坚决斗争。
    我国政府和人民早已指出过，美国对印度尼西亚内政的任何进一步的干涉必将引起严重后果。我国政府和人民坚决反对美国利用台湾扩大和加紧对印度尼西亚共和国的干涉，全力支持印度尼西亚政府和人民反对外来的干涉和颠覆活动的正义斗争，并且深信这一斗争一定会取得最后胜利。美国必须立即停止这种破坏亚洲和平的罪恶活动，否则它必须对由此而产生的一切后果负完全的责任。
