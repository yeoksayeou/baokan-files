Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 18th. TASS reported: Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko issued a statement at a press conference on the 18th, saying that the Soviet government has learned that recently, American bombers carrying atomic bombs and hydrogen bombs, under orders from the American command, have flown towards the Soviet border through the Arctic region more than once. The Soviet government strongly protests this action that threatens peace and demands that the US Air Force immediately cease such flights.

The statement said that the Soviet government also calls on the governments of other countries to protest so that the people of all countries can escape the danger caused by the provocative actions of the US Air Force.

In view of the fact that these flights by the US Air Force seriously threaten international peace, the Soviet government also requests the United Nations Security Council to discuss the issue of stopping these flights.

The statement pointed out that the flight of American bombers carrying nuclear weapons through the Arctic region towards the Soviet border is an extremely dangerous act of playing with fire, unheard of in peacetime. The statement said that the Soviet government considers this action to be a dangerous provocation against the cause of peace.

According to a United Press report, an American general explained that whenever their observers saw a vague image on the radar screen that they thought was a missile or ballistic rocket, they would send planes on such flights. Later, it was found that this was actually caused by electronic interference or meteor showers.

The statement said that it is conceivable that if the Americans were not good at recognizing meteors in time and mistook them for missiles, then American planes would continue to fly towards the Soviet border. In this case, in order to protect the safety of the Soviet people, the Soviet Union would have to take immediate measures to eliminate the oncoming threat.

The irresponsible and provocative actions of the US military command could trigger a new war in an instant. Their behavior has several times brought mankind almost to the brink of a new war, and the people of all countries have not even thought about what kind of danger the world has faced.

The statement pointed out that the Soviet government does not want to believe that these actions by the US Air Force are approved by the US government and President Eisenhower himself. However, no one has denied this. The current situation in the world is such that as long as there is a slight mistake by an American technician, a slight carelessness, a miscalculation, or a misjudgment by an American officer, an atomic war may befall people.

The statement said that the Soviet people are deeply angered by the provocative actions of the US Air Force. If the United States takes such measures in an attempt to intimidate the Soviet Union, it will be in vain. The Soviets are not weaklings. The Soviet armed forces possess all the necessary means to reliably protect the peaceful life of the Soviet people, and if necessary, can give a fatal rebuff to any aggressor.

    美国带核武器飞机向苏联边界飞行
    苏联抗议美国对和平挑衅  呼吁各国政府制止美国玩火行为
    新华社18日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联外交部长葛罗米柯18日在记者招待会上发表声明说，苏联政府获悉，最近载有原子弹和氢弹的美国轰炸机奉美国指挥部的命令，曾经不止一次地通过北极地区向苏联边界飞行。苏联政府坚决抗议这种威胁和平的行动，并且要求美国空军立即停止这种飞行。
    声明说，苏联政府同时呼吁其他国家的政府也提出抗议，以便各国人民摆脱美国空军挑衅性行动所造成的危险。
    鉴于美国空军的这种飞行严重地威胁着国际和平，苏联政府还请求联合国安全理事会讨论停止这种飞行的问题。
    声明指出，带有核武器的美国轰炸机通过北极地区向苏联国境飞行，这是在和平时期闻所未闻的极其危险的玩火行为。声明说，苏联政府认为，这种行动是对和平事业危险的挑衅。
    根据合众社消息，美国将军解释说，每当他们的观测员在雷达幕上看到某种他们认为是导弹或弹道火箭的模糊形象时，就派飞机作这种飞行。后来查明，这实际上是电子干扰或陨石雨造成的。
    声明说，可以设想，如果美国人不善于及时地认出流星不是导弹，那时，美国飞机还将继续朝向苏联国境飞行。在这种情况下，为了保卫苏联人民的安全，苏联就将必需立即采取措施来消除迎面而来的威胁。
    美国军事指挥部的不负责任的和挑衅性的行动，可能在一瞬间使新战争爆发，他们这种行为曾经几次使人类几乎卷入新战争之中，而各国人民甚至于没有想到世界曾经面临过什么样的危险。
    声明指出，苏联政府不愿意相信，美国空军的这些行动是得到美国政府和艾森豪威尔总统本人的准许的。可是，并没有谁来否认这一点。目前世界所处的情况是，只要美国技术员有丝毫的差错，稍不小心，计算错误，或者是某一个美国军官判断错误，原子战争就可能降临到人们的头上。
    声明说，苏联人民对美国空军的挑衅性行动深感愤怒，如果美国采取这种措施是企图吓倒苏联，那就是枉费心机了。苏联人并不是神经衰弱的人。苏联武装部队拥有可以牢靠地保卫苏联人民的和平生活的一切必需的手段，而且在必要时就能够给任何侵略者以致命回击。
