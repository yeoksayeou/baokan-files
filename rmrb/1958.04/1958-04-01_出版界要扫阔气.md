Reader's words:

    The Publishing Industry Must Sweep Away Extravagance
    The phenomenon of inconsistent page sizes has long existed in the publishing industry. Each publishing house has its own set of specifications. Taking the same 787×1092 1/32 size and using old No. 5 font as an example: the specification of China Youth Publishing House is twenty-seven columns, with twenty-six characters per column; the specification of Workers' Publishing House is not uniform, some are twenty-one columns, with twenty-three characters per column, and some are twenty-two columns, with twenty-five characters per column. Taking the same 850×1168 1/32 size and using old No. 5 font as an example: the specification of China Youth Publishing House is thirty columns, with twenty-eight characters per column; the specification of People's Literature Publishing House is also not uniform, some are twenty-seven columns, with twenty-seven characters per column, and some are twenty-six columns, with twenty-seven characters per column. If the specifications of China Youth Publishing House are taken as the standard, Workers' Publishing House prints an average of one hundred and eighty characters less per page, with an error of 25.7%; People's Literature Publishing House prints an average of one hundred and twenty-five characters less per page, with an error of 14.8%. The waste generated by such a large error is alarming. The book "True Records from Prison" published by Workers' Publishing House could be reduced from eighty-two pages to fifty-six pages. The printing number of this book is 540,000 copies, which is equivalent to using 450 reams of extra newsprint, totaling 13,500 yuan.
    I think that the Publishing Bureau of the Ministry of Culture should start planning and unifying page specifications. According to the different characteristics and requirements of books, books should be divided into grades. Except for necessary hardcover books that can be considered for special aesthetics, the utilization coefficient of general paperback books should be increased as much as possible. I think that typesetting with the new No. 5 font is most suitable for eyesight and also more economical. I hope that the publishing industry will eliminate conservatism and extravagance through this "double-anti" movement.

    出版界要扫阔气
    出版界长期存在着版面规格不统一的现象。各出版社都有自己一套规格，以同样的787×1092 1/32以及用老五号字排为例：中国青年出版社的规格是二十七列，每列二十六字；工人出版社的规格不统一，有的是二十一列，每列二十三字，有的是二十二列，每列二十五字。再以同样的850×1168 1/32以及用老五号字排为例：中国青年出版社的规格是三十列，每列二十八字；人民文学出版社的规格也不统一，有的是二十七列，每列二十七字，有的是二十六列，每列二十七字。如以中国青年出版社的规格为准，工人出版社每版平均少排一百八十字，误差25.7％；人民文学出版社每版平均少排一百二十五字，误差14.8％。这样大的误差所产生的浪费是惊人的，工人出版社出版的“狱中纪实”一书，就可以由八十二页减为五十六页，这本书的印数是五十四万本，折算多用报纸四百五十令，合计一万三千五百元。
    我觉得，文化部出版局应该着手规划，统一版面规格，根据图书的不同特点和要求，把图书分成等级，除了必要的精装书可以考虑特别美观外，一般平装书应该尽量提高利用系数。我认为用新五号字排版，对视力最合适，也比较经济。希望出版界通过这次双反运动扫除保守和阔气。
