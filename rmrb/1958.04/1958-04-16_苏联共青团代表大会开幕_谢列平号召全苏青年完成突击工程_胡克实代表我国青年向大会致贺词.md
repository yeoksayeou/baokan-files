Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 15th: The 13th Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union opened at 10:00 AM today in the Great Kremlin Palace.

The atmosphere of the congress was solemn, lively, and enthusiastic. Before the opening, the delegates sang Komsomol songs, songs praising the youth's achievements, and songs of friendship between the youth of various countries. Approximately forty youth delegations from various countries, a delegation from the World Federation of Democratic Youth, and the Chinese youth delegation headed by Hu Ke Shi were invited to participate in the congress.

Over 1,200 delegates from all over the Soviet Union attended the congress. When Soviet Party and government leaders Khrushchev, Voroshilov, Mikoyan, Kirichenko, Kozlov, and others entered the venue, the whole audience was filled with enthusiasm, rising to applaud and erupting into cheers.

Kirichenko delivered a congratulatory message to the congress on behalf of the Central Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, which was warmly received.

The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the Komsomol, Shelepin, delivered a summary report. The delegates discussed Shelepin's report.

The head of the Chinese youth delegation, Hu Ke Shi, addressed the congress this afternoon and delivered a congratulatory message on behalf of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League.

Subsequently, the President of the World Federation of Democratic Youth, Bernini, and others delivered speeches.

Xinhua News Agency, April 15th: TASS, Moscow: The First Secretary of the Central Committee of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union, Shelepin, said in a report to the Soviet Komsomol Congress on the 15th that communist youth organizations worldwide now have approximately sixty million young men and women, whereas before the Second World War, they had less than five million.

In his report, Shelepin suggested submitting a call to the congress for discussion, urging all Soviet young workers to launch a socialist competition to strive to have industrial labor productivity reach the 1960 level stipulated in the Five-Year Plan within 1959. He also suggested that the congress declare the construction projects of seven blast furnaces, three open-hearth furnaces, nine coke ovens, eleven rolling mills, and some factories and enterprises in the petroleum, gas, and other industrial sectors as Komsomol shock projects.

In his report to the congress, Shelepin spoke about the important role of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League in Soviet communist construction, especially in recent years in land reclamation, the development of industrial construction in the eastern regions, and the contributions made to the country in Soviet livestock production.

Shelepin then discussed the issue of further improving the ideological education work of the Komsomol organizations. He suggested strengthening aesthetic education for young people, improving their communist moral education, and helping them establish a materialist worldview.

Shelepin pointed out that the reactionary imperialists are trying their best to split the international communist youth movement and undermine its strength and unity. Recently, revisionists have intensified their attacks on the Marxist-Leninist principles regarding the role and tasks of the Communist Youth League. They are trying to detach the Komsomol from the Party and remove it from the Party's leadership. Shelepin said: "This is a foolish delusion. The Komsomol has always been, is now, and will continue to be the helper and reserve of the Soviet Communist Party."

Shelepin spoke about the Soviet youth's international connections. He said that the Soviet Komsomol should make every effort to strengthen and develop fraternal ties with the youth of socialist countries, strengthen and expand ties with communist youth and their organizations around the world, strive to establish business relationships with social democrats and act together with them, resolutely oppose colonialism, and establish connections with all those who cherish world peace and the happiness of the younger generation.

Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 15th: The head of the Chinese youth delegation, Secretary of the Secretariat of the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League, Hu Ke Shi, delivered a congratulatory message at the 13th Congress of the All-Union Leninist Young Communist League of the Soviet Union on the afternoon of the 15th. He extended warm congratulations to the congress, to the Soviet Komsomol members, and to all the youth on behalf of the Chinese Communist Youth League members and youth.

Hu Ke Shi said that the Soviet Leninist Young Communist League is the glorious heir to the great cause of the October Socialist Revolution. Soviet Komsomol members and youth have made immortal contributions to their motherland, whether in the difficult war years or in the peaceful period of building a new life. Since the 20th Congress of the Soviet Communist party, inspired by the magnificent program of building communism, and under the correct leadership of the Central Committe of the Soviet Communist Party headed by Comrade Khrushchev, the Soviet Komsomol has brought a great initiative and pioneering spirit into play.

Hu Ke Shi said that today's era is an era in which socialism shines brightly. The Soviet people are fighting to catch up with or surpass the United States in the output of important industrial products calculated per capita in fifteen years. The Chinese people are also fighting to catch up with or surpass Britain in steel and other major industrial products during the same period. The course of history will ultimately prove that in the not-too-distant future, the socialist world will leave the capitalist countries far behind!

Hu Ke Shi then spoke about the new upsurge of the Chinese people and youth in building socialism on the basis of the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle, and the new atmosphere of a great leap forward in all aspects of the country. The Chinese Communist Youth League and the Chinese youth are the most heroic shock force in the great leap forward. He said that the victory and progress of China's socialist cause are inseparable from the fraternal assistance of the great Soviet Union. We express our heartfelt thanks to the great Soviet people and youth! The friendship and unity between the people of China and the Soviet Union, which have developed during the long revolutionary struggle, are unbreakable. The Chinese youth will always cherish this great friendship and will definitely develop this great friendship from generation to generation.

Hu Ke Shi finally read out the congratulatory message from the Central Committee of the Chinese Communist Youth League to the congress. The congratulatory message stated that the Soviet Leninist Young Communist League is a model for the Chinese Communist Youth League and the world's communist youth movement. We believe that this congress will further mobilize Soviet Komsomol members and youth to make even more brilliant contributions to the great task of accelerating the transition to communism that the Soviet Communist Party has put forward to the Soviet people. The congratulatory message concluded by saying, let us join hands more closely and strive together for lasting world peace and for the victory of the cause of socialism and communism.

    谢列平号召全苏青年完成突击工程
    胡克实代表我国青年向大会致贺词
    据新华社莫斯科15日电　苏联列宁共产主义青年团第十三次代表大会今天上午十时在大克里姆林宫开幕。
    大会气氛庄严、活跃、热烈。开幕前，代表们唱共青团歌曲、唱表扬青年功勋的歌曲和各国青年友谊的歌曲。应邀参加代表大会的约有四十个来自各国的青年代表团、世界民主青年联盟的代表团和以胡克实为首的中国青年代表团。
    出席代表大会的有来自苏联各地的一千二百多名代表。当苏联共产党和苏联政府领导人赫鲁晓夫、伏罗希洛夫、米高扬、基里钦科、科兹洛夫等走进会场时，全场热情高涨、起立鼓掌、转为欢呼。
    基里钦科代表苏共中央向大会致贺词，受到热烈欢迎。
    共青团中央第一书记谢列平作了总结报告。代表们就谢列平的报告进行了讨论。
    中国青年代表团团长胡克实今天下午向大会讲了话，并且代表中国共产主义青年团中央委员会致祝词。
    接着，世界民主青年联盟主席柏尼尼等致词。
    据新华社15日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联列宁共产主义青年团中央委员会第一书记谢列平15日在苏联共青团代表大会上作报告时说，现在全世界共产主义青年组织已经拥有约六千万男女青年，而在第二次世界大战以前，它们只拥有不到五百万人。
    谢列平在作报告时建议把一份号召书提交代表大会讨论，这份号召书号召全体苏联青年工人展开社会主义竞赛，争取在1959年内就使工业的劳动生产率达到五年计划规定的1960年的水平。他还建议代表大会宣布七座高炉、三座平炉、九座炼焦炉、十一台轧钢机和一些石油、煤气和其他工业部门的工厂和企业的建设工程为共青团突击工程。
    谢列平在向代表大会作的报告中谈到了苏联列宁共产主义青年团在苏联共产主义建设中所起的重要作用，特别是最近几年在开垦荒地、发展东部地区的工业建设和苏联畜牧业生产方面为国家所作的贡献。
    谢列平接着谈到了进一步改进共青团组织的思想教育工作问题。他建议加强对青年进行美学教育，改进他们的共产主义道德教育，帮助他们建立唯物主义世界观。
    谢列平指出，帝国主义反动派企图竭力分裂国际共产主义青年运动，破坏它的力量和团结。最近，修正主义者加紧进攻马克思列宁主义关于共产主义青年团的作用和任务的原则。他们企图使共青团脱离党，使它离开党的领导。谢列平说：“这是愚蠢的妄想。共青团过去、现在和将来都一直是苏联共产党的助手和后备军”。
    谢列平谈到了苏联青年的国际联系。他说，苏联共青团应当全力加强和发展同社会主义国家青年的兄弟联系，加强和扩大同全世界青年共产主义者及其组织的联系，争取同社会党人建立事务联系并且同他们共同行动，坚决反对殖民主义，同一切珍视世界和平和青年一代幸福的人建立联系。
    据新华社莫斯科15日电　中国青年代表团团长、中国共产主义青年团中央委员会书记处书记胡克实15日下午在苏联列宁共产主义青年团第十三次代表大会上致贺词。他代表中国共青团员和青年，向代表大会，向苏联共青团员和全体青年致热烈的祝贺。
    胡克实说，苏联列宁共产主义青年团是伟大十月社会主义革命事业的光荣继承者。苏联共青团员和青年不论在艰难困苦的战争年代，还是从事新生活建设的和平时期，都为自己的祖国立下了不朽的功勋。在苏共第二十次代表大会以后，苏联共青团在建设共产主义宏伟纲领的鼓舞下，在以赫鲁晓夫同志为首的苏共中央正确领导下，发挥了更大的主动性和首创精神。
    胡克实说，今天的时代，是社会主义大放光芒的时代。苏联人民正在为十五年在工业重要产品按人口平均计算的产量方面赶上或者超过美国而斗争。中国人民也正为在同一期间在钢铁和其他主要工业生产品方面赶上或者超过英国而斗争。历史的进程终究会这样证明：在不要很久的将来，社会主义世界将把资本主义国家远远地抛在后面！
    胡克实接着谈到了在整风运动和反右派斗争的基础上中国人民和青年建设社会主义的新高潮和目前全国各方面出现的大跃进的新气象。中国共青团和中国青年是大跃进中一支最英勇的突击力量。他说，中国社会主义事业的胜利和进展是同伟大苏联的兄弟援助分不开的。我们向伟大的苏联人民和青年表示衷心的感谢！在长期的革命斗争中发展起来的中苏两国人民的友谊和团结，是牢不可破的。中国青年将永远珍贵这种伟大的友谊，一定要把这种伟大友谊世世代代地发展下去。
    胡克实最后宣读了中国共产主义青年团中央委员会给代表大会的贺词。贺词说，苏联列宁共产主义青年团，是中国共产主义青年团和全世界共产主义青年运动的榜样。我们相信，这次代表大会将进一步动员苏联共青团员和青年，在实现苏联共产党向苏联人民提出的加速向共产主义过渡的伟大任务中，将作出更加光辉的贡献。贺词最后说，让我们更紧密地携起手来，为了争取世界持久和平，为了社会主义和共产主义事业的胜利共同奋斗。
