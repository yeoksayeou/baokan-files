    The Cold "Cash Transaction"
    ——A Brief Review of the Greek Film "The Counterfeit Coin"
    Mei Qian
    The Greek film "The Counterfeit Coin" is composed of four exquisite and vivid short stories, connected by the circulation of a counterfeit coin. In this way, we see various aspects of real life in Greece, all kinds of different characters, and thus perceive the distorted face of the entire Greek society under imperialist rule. The camera takes us deep into the most corrupt and dark corners of this capitalist society: some people live a life of extravagance and deceit, while others struggle on the verge of unemployment and starvation. Although this film consists of four independent segments, it has a unified theme, giving a complete impression. It shows that in this social system, money has become the sole master of life, and money cruelly dominates people's fate. For money, people sell their conscience, youth, body and soul. Human dignity is cruelly damaged. A character named Ding Nuo in the film says: "Since the beginning of time, haven't people been robbing each other? Why? Isn't it all for money!" They live in this sad logic of people dying for wealth.
    An honest and kind jeweler, because he is seduced by bad people and falls in love, wants to get rich in order to satisfy the other party's greedy desires, and does not hesitate to violate his conscience, using his exquisite skills to make counterfeit coins. He spent more than a hundred gold coins of his hard-earned money to buy tools and equipment to make the first counterfeit coin. But this did not bring him any happiness, but made him unable to sleep peacefully, and fear and guilt have since entangled him. This counterfeit coin not only exhausted all his savings, but also took away his honest and peaceful heart. Finally, in fear, he destroyed all the equipment and gave it to a beggar. Trying to steal a chicken only to lose the rice used to lure it. This is a comedy, but also a social tragedy.
    I think the most prominent is the segment of the blind beggar and the street angel. A person with open eyes pretends to be blind on the street to swindle others' sympathy and alms, a young girl dresses up flamboyantly to sell her youth. And they argue endlessly at the corner of that solemn church, becoming enemies in order to compete for this good location for business. But when the beggar gets this counterfeit coin, he suddenly becomes the prostitute's client, but when he discovers that the gold coin has been lost, they curse and fight each other again, and are eventually arrested by the police together. This not only reflects the serious unemployment and poverty in society; but also reveals a truth in the bizarre change of the two people from enemies to "lovers" and from "lovers" to enemies: in a society ruled by the bourgeoisie, "there is no other nexus between man and man than naked self-interest, than callous 'cash payment'."
  (See the Communist Manifesto). The film precisely provides a powerful annotation for this, it not only "resolved personal worth into exchange value," but also turned people into cheap animals. It looks really shocking. From these points, we not only marvel at the author's exquisite and condensed artistic skills, but also see the progressive tendency of this film in thought.
    Although the film exposes some deformed and dark phenomena in this society, and the exposure is quite profound, it has not found the real reason for this. The film raises some serious social problems, but does not give correct answers, let alone point out the direction of struggle to change this social system. In some places, it obscures the cruel reality of class exploitation with a kind of warm tears. For example, a simple and hardworking painter, suffering from the pain of unemployment, is forced by the landlord Ma Fox to pay him, and finally dies due to work-related injuries, leaving Fang Niu to become an orphan selling flowers on the street. Originally, in Fang Niu's eyes, Ma Fox had become a blood-sucking demon, but the author finally made Ma Fox accept the counterfeit coin picked up by Fang Niu due to some sense of emptiness in life, and exchanged money for her as if it were a real coin, and gained Fang Niu's favor. This kind of reconciliationist thinking dilutes the sharp contradiction between the exploiter and the exploited. Similarly, the author also made the jeweler get psychological comfort after confessing in front of the Virgin. This inevitably smears a layer of religious mystery on the severe reality. The author cleverly uses narration in many places to satirize and ridicule those social phenomena; on the one hand, he maintains that social system from the concept of morality and conscience. The author's thoughts are in a contradictory state. Due to the author's blurred worldview, the realistic significance of this film is limited to a certain extent.

    冷酷的“现金交易”
    ——简评希腊影片“伪金币”
    梅阡
    希腊影片“伪金币”是四个精采生动的小故事组成的，由一块伪金币的流转，把它们串联起来。这样，使我们看到希腊国家现实生活的各个方面，形形色色的各种人物，从而透视在帝国主义统治下希腊国家整个社会的畸形面貌。镜头带领我们深入到这个资本主义社会最腐朽最阴暗的角落：一些人过着骄奢淫逸、尔虞我诈的生活；一些人却在失业与饥饿的死亡线上挣扎。这部影片虽由四个独立的片断组成，却有着统一的主题，给人以一个完整的印象。它说明在这种社会制度下，金钱成了生活唯一的主宰，金钱在严酷地支配着人们的命运。为了金钱人们出卖自己的良心、青春、肉体和灵魂。人的尊严受到残酷的损伤。影片中一个叫丁懦的人说：“自从开天辟地以来，人们不都是你抢我夺吗？为什么？还不是为的钱吗！”他们便是生活在这人为财死的可悲逻辑里。
    一个诚实善良的手饰匠人，因为受到坏人的勾引，堕入情网，为了满足对方贪婪的欲望，想发财，不惜违背自己的良心，用他精巧的手艺去制造伪币。他花了一百多块金币的血本，购买工具器材，制造出第一块伪币来。但这并没有给他带来任何幸福，反而连觉也睡不安稳了，恐惧与内疚从此紧紧缠住了他。这块伪币不但耗尽了他所有的积蓄，而且夺去了他一颗诚实而平静的心。终于在恐惧之下，他毁弃了所有的器材，并且把它舍给了一个乞丐。偷鸡不着蚀把米。这是一出喜剧，也是一个社会的悲剧。
    我觉得最突出的是瞎子乞丐和马路天使那一片断。一个睁着眼睛的人在街头装成瞎子来骗取别人的怜悯与施舍，一个年轻的姑娘打扮得花枝招展，出卖自己的青春。而他们就在那庄严的教堂转角上争吵不休，为了争夺这块作买卖的好地段，变成仇人。可是当乞丐获得这块伪金币之后，忽然又成了妓女的嫖客，但在发现金币已经遗失时，他们又互相咒骂厮打起来，终被警察一起逮捕。这不仅反映了社会严重的失业与贫困现象；而且在两个人从仇敌到“情侣”，又从“情侣”到仇敌的诡奇的变化中，揭示了一个真理：在资产阶级统治的社会里，“人与人之间除了赤裸裸的利害关系之外，除了冷酷无情的‘现金交易’之外，再也找不出什么别的联系了。”
  （见共产党宣言）。影片恰恰为此作了有力的注解，它不但“把人底身价变成了交换价值”，而且把人变成了廉价的动物。看起来真是令人触目惊心。从这些地方我们不仅惊叹作者艺术手段的精湛凝炼，也可以看出这部影片思想上的进步倾向。
    影片虽然揭露了这个社会一些畸形、阴暗的现象，也揭露得相当深刻，但他并没有找到所以这样的真正原因。影片提出了一些严肃的社会问题，可是没有给予正确的答案，更没有指出改变这个社会制度的斗争方向。有的地方反而以一种温情的眼泪模糊了阶级剥削的残酷的现实。例如一个淳朴勤劳的粉刷工人，在失业的痛苦中受着房主马狐狸威凌的逼索，终于因工伤死亡，丢下芳妞沦为街头卖花的孤女。本来在芳妞的眼里马狐狸已经成为吃人饮血的恶魔，但作者最后却使马狐狸由于某种生活空虚之感，接受了芳妞拾来的那块伪币，当作真币一样换钱给她，获得了芳妞的好感。这种调和主义的思想，冲淡了剥削者与被剥削者间尖锐的矛盾。同样作者也使手饰匠人在圣母面前忏悔之后，得到心灵的安慰。这又不免在严峻的现实上面涂抹了一层宗教的神秘色彩。作者在许多地方巧妙地利用旁白对于那些社会现象予以冷讽热嘲的抨击；一方面却又从道德与良心的观念上，维护着那个社会制度。作者的思想处于矛盾的状态中。由于作者世界观的模糊，使这部影片的现实意义受到了一定的局限。
