Notes

    The Face of a Jackal
    While the US Congress was discussing the next year's
  "foreign aid" appropriation bill, former Nepalese Prime Minister Singh, at a public gathering in Kathmandu, exposed the US "foreign aid" mission's plot to interfere in Nepal's internal affairs. He said that during his tenure, the Americans had "threatened" him with the cancellation of five million dollars in "aid" to make him sign an agreement related to US "aid." Singh also said that the head of the US "foreign aid" mission had written a letter threatening him, saying that if he did not issue a passport to a Nepalese woman the Americans wanted to take to the United States, the United States would sever diplomatic relations with Nepal.
    What the former prime minister exposed is, of course, not all the ugly things the US "foreign aid" mission and the United States have done under the guise of "foreign aid," but these two facts alone are enough to fully expose the ferocious jackal face of the United States, this fake "philanthropist." Today, those who still have some illusions about "US aid" should learn a useful lesson from Singh's experience and not let the wolf into the house for the sake of a small amount of "US aid."

    豺狼的嘴脸
    当美国国会正在讨论下年度
  “援外”拨款法案的时候，尼泊尔前首相辛格在加德满都一次公众集会上，揭露了美国“援外”使团干涉尼泊尔内政的阴谋。他说，在他执政期间，美国人曾以取消五百万美元的“援助”，来“吓唬”他，要他签订一项有关美“援”的协定。辛格还说，美国“援外”使团团长曾写信威胁他说，如果他不发护照给美国人希望带到美国去的一个尼泊尔女子，美国就要同尼泊尔断绝外交关系。
    这位前首相所揭露的，当然不是美国“援外”使团和美国在“援外”幌子下所干的全部丑事，但是，仅只这两件事实就已经充分暴露了美国这个假“慈善家”的凶恶的豺狼嘴脸。今天，对“美援”还存在着某些幻想的人，倒是应当从辛格的体验中吸取有益的教训，不要为了区区的“美援”而引狼入室。
