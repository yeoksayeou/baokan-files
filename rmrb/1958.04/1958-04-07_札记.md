    Stupid "Prediction"
    While the gales and storms of economic recession throw the entire United States into panic and unease, economic experts at the U.S. Department of Labor are "optimistically" predicting that the economic recession is actually quite beneficial to the United States. The reasoning is that it will accelerate America's "technological revolution" and enable the technological development of the United States to surpass other industrial countries.

    This "prediction" can obviously be called one of humanity's most stupid lies without shame. Anyone with a modicum of sense would see how absurd and ridiculous it is. If the economic recession were truly so beneficial to the United States, then why are the likes of Eisenhower shouting themselves hoarse trying to prevent it?

    However, this absurd "prediction" is not entirely without significance. Wall Street's kept economists used to assert that the economic recession would not last too long in order to reassure the public; but now, in order to reassure the public, they have begun to praise the benefits of economic recession. Doesn't this change precisely illustrate the ferocity of this American economic recession and the awkward situation that the American ruling group already feels unable to cope with?

    Such a Threat
    It is said that a so-called "Million-Member Committee" cobbled together by a group of reactionary politicians in the United States has openly issued a statement attacking the Sino-Japanese trade agreement as a "threat to the free world," demanding that Japan "reconsider" the agreement.

    That China and Japan want to conduct mutually beneficial trade on an equal footing could actually threaten the "free world" is a strange argument indeed. This makes it all the more clear what kind of "world" the "free world" is. According to the logic of American politicians, only the United States is allowed to conduct some unequal trade with other countries, including Japan, in this "world." Therefore, China's conducting mutually beneficial trade with Japan naturally poses a "threat" to it, and the United States must threaten Japan to reconsider.

    札记
    愚蠢的“预言”
    当经济衰退的疾风骤雨使得整个美国陷于惶乱不安的时候，美国劳工部的经济专家们却“乐观”地预言说：经济衰退对美国是颇有好处的。理由是，这将加速美国的“技术革命”，使美国的技术发展超过其它工业国家。
    这种“预言”显然可以被称作人类最愚蠢的谎言之一而无愧。只要稍有头脑的人，就会看出它是多末荒谬可笑。如果经济衰退真对美国有这样的好处，那末艾森豪威尔之流为什么还要力竭声嘶地叫嚷防止经济衰退呢？
    不过，这种荒谬的“预言”倒也并非完全没有意义。华尔街的御用经济学家们过去为了安定人心，曾经断言经济衰退是不会延续太久的；而现在他们为了安定人心，却开始来赞美经济衰退的好处了。这种变化，难道不正说明了这次美国经济衰退来势之凶和美国统治集团已经感到应付乏术的窘相吗？
    如此威胁
    据说，美国的一个由一批反动政客拼凑成的所谓“百万人委员会“公然发表声明，攻击中日贸易协定是“对自由世界的胁威”，要日本“重新考虑”这个协定。
    中国和日本要进行平等互利的贸易，竟然会威胁“自由世界”，这种论调实在奇怪。这样，“自由世界”是个什么样的“世界”也就不言可知了。按照美国政客的逻辑，在这个“世界”中只能让美国同其他国家，包括日本，进行一些不平等的贸易。因此中国同日本进行平等互惠的贸易，自然就给它造成了一种“威胁”，而美国就非威胁日本重新考虑不可。
