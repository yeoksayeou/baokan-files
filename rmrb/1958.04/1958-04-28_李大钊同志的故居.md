Comrade Li Dazhao was from Daheizhuang Village, Leting County, Hebei Province. Throughout his life, he dedicated himself to the revolution, never concerning himself with family matters, hence his former residence was quite dilapidated. Last spring, several villages near Daheizhuang Village held a mass meeting to commemorate the 30th anniversary of Comrade Dazhao's martyrdom. At the meeting, many people requested that Comrade Dazhao's former residence be repaired as a memorial. The Hebei Provincial Cultural Bureau, in accordance with the people's demands and adhering to the principles of simplicity, solidity, and preservation of authenticity, sent representatives to the county and township to hold several symposiums and individual interviews, establishing a renovation committee and proposing a renovation plan.

Construction officially began in August of last year, and by the end of November, the main gate, second gate, side rooms, main house, study, and other areas had been repaired. Currently, efforts are being actively made to collect and organize Comrade Dazhao's personal belongings to prepare for restoration and display, so that Comrade Dazhao's former residence can become a place for educating the masses and ensuring that his revolutionary legacy is never forgotten among the broad masses.

    李大钊同志的故居
    李大钊同志是河北省乐亭县大黑坨庄人，他毕生奔走革命，从未顾及家庭细事，故居住宅，都很破烂。去年春天，大黑坨庄附近的几个村子，召开了纪念大钊同志殉难三十周年群众大会。会上，很多人要求把大钊同志故居进行修复，以示纪念。河北省文化局根据群众要求，并且依据朴素、坚固，以存其真的原则，派人和县、乡召开了几次座谈会和个别访问，成立了修缮委员会，提出修缮计划。
    去年8月正式动工，到11月底已经将大门、二门、厢房、正房、书房等处修理完毕。现在正积极进行搜集、整理大钊同志生前遗物，准备复原陈列，使大钊同志故居成为教育群众的场所，并且使他的革命遗迹在广大群众中永志不忘。　（捷民）（附图片）
