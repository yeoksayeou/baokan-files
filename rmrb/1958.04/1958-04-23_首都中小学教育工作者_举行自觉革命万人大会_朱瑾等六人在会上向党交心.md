    Capital Primary and Secondary School Educators
    Hold a Ten-Thousand Person Meeting for Conscious Revolution
    Zhu Jin and Five Others Confess to the Party at the Meeting
    (Our Newspaper News) The Beijing Branch of the Chinese Education Union convened the Beijing Primary and Secondary School Educators' Conscious Revolution Promotion Meeting on the afternoon of April 22nd. Over 15,000 primary and secondary school teachers and others attended. At the meeting, six primary and secondary school educators boldly revealed their erroneous thoughts and statements in education, teaching, and political stance, and frankly confessed to the Party.
    Zhu Jin, a teacher at Shijia Hutong Elementary School, used a specific example to powerfully expose her erroneous thought of looking down on the children of workers and peasants. She said: In 1957, there was a student named Zhao Guangcai from a rural village in Heilongjiang. When Zhao's parent led him to meet her, although Zhao Guangcai was neatly dressed, she still felt that Zhao was not clean, and looked like a country bumpkin, and thought "Here comes another student who is totally useless." On the first day of class, she deliberately asked Zhao Guangcai questions. Because Zhao was new to the school and unfamiliar with the environment, and also because Zhu's attitude towards him was stern, Zhao stood up and couldn't say a word. After class, she consciously went to spread the word that Zhao didn't know anything. Later, she saw that Zhao's homework book had many typos, and immediately talked to Zhao's parents, emphasizing that they should tutor him. With the help of his parents, Zhao's homework improved, but Zhu still gave Zhao a failing grade. At the end of the semester, Zhu took Zhao Guangcai's usual grades and the exam papers (all failing) to the principal, insisting that Zhao repeat the grade, and only felt happy when the principal agreed, thinking that she had gotten rid of a useless student. Zhu Jin felt very pained after recounting this incident, and expressed her determination to burn all the dirty bourgeois thoughts in her mind during the Double-Anti Movement and become a truly worthy people's teacher.
    At the meeting, some teachers revealed their erroneous thoughts of pursuing personal fame and gain, and "becoming expert before becoming red." Cheng Zufan, a mathematics teacher at the Twenty-first Middle School, said: He used to mistakenly believe that evaluating teachers' work performance mainly depended on talent. If he wanted to be promoted, he had to bury himself in hard work and study advanced mathematics, and would not do anything that hindered his studies. Furthermore, in order to gain time to study advanced mathematics, he even asked the school to reduce four classes and one "head" last semester, only taking twelve classes and one "head" due to illness. He did this after carefully calculating the costs and benefits. He said: "Twelve classes is two hours less than the quota workload, which requires a deduction of 7.2 yuan, which is only 30 yuan per semester. Freeing up time can both allow me to study a little for long-term benefits, and also write two articles for 'Mathematics Bulletin,' one article can earn 40 or 50 yuan, so there is no loss of income, and it can also be used as capital for promotion." Some teachers also boldly exposed their erroneous thoughts and statements during the blooming and contending period, and their half-hearted attitude towards the Party. Xu Chubo, the more than sixty-year-old principal of Men's No. 1 Middle School, exposed his half-heartedness towards the Communist Party through several specific incidents such as the Three-Anti and Five-Anti Movements, and the Suppression of Counter-revolutionaries, his abstract support for the Party's policies, and his resistance when it came to specific issues, especially those related to personal interests, and expressed that he would "hand his heart over to the Party and advance lightly with all comrades."
    During the meeting, teachers and staff from Women's No. 12 Middle School, No. 61 Middle School, Shijia Hutong and other schools submitted letters of determination to confess to the Party to the conference. Teacher representatives from Women's No. 14 Middle School also read out a challenge letter to confess to the Party at the conference. Finally, Feng Suhai, Vice Chairman of the National Committee of the Chinese Education Union, and Yang Bozhen, Deputy Director of the Education Department of the Beijing Municipal Committee of the Communist Party of China, spoke at the meeting.

    首都中小学教育工作者
    举行自觉革命万人大会
    朱瑾等六人在会上向党交心
    本报讯　中国教育工会北京市分会于4月22日下午召开北京市中小学教育工作者自觉革命促进大会，到会的有中小学教师等一万五千多人。会上，有六位中小学教育工作者大胆地揭露了自己在教育、教学和政治立场等方面的错误思想和言论，坦率地向党交心。
    史家胡同小学教师朱瑾通过一个具体事例，有力地揭露了自己轻视工农子弟的错误思想。她说：1957年有一个来自黑龙江农村的学生赵广才，当赵的家长领着他和她见面时，虽然赵广才衣着很整洁，但她仍觉得赵不干净，土头土脑，并想“又来了个大二分的学生”。第一天上课时，她存心向赵广才提问，因为赵刚到校环境生疏，又加朱对他的态度严厉，赵站起来说不出话来。下课后，她有意识地去宣传赵什么也不会。以后，她看到赵的作业本错别字很多，立刻找赵的家长谈话，强调要家长给他补课。经过他的家长的帮助，赵的作业有了进步，朱仍然给赵二分。到期末，朱拿着赵广才平时的成绩和大考的卷子给校长看（都是二分），坚持要赵留级，直到校长允许而才愉快，认为可去了二分学生。朱瑾叙述这件事后感到很痛心，并表示要下定决心在双反运动中把脑子里所有的肮脏的资产阶级思想烧尽，成为一个名副其实的人民教师。
    会上，有的教师揭露了追求个人名利，“先专后红”的错误思想。二十一中数学教师程祖璠说：他过去错误地认为评定教师的工作成绩主要是靠才，若想升级，必须埋头苦干，钻研高等数学，凡有碍他学习的事情一律不干。并且为了争取时间进修高等数学，上学期还借身体不好向学校要求减少四节课和一个“头”，只担任十二节课一个“头”。他这样做是算了一笔细账的。他说：“十二节课较定额工作量少两个钟头，需要扣七元二角钱，一学期也不过扣三十元。腾出时间既可以念点书为长远利益作准备，也可以给‘数学通报’写两篇稿，一篇稿就可以拿四、五十元，收入没有损失，还可以此作为升级的资本。”有的教师还大胆地暴露在鸣放期间的错误思想和言论，对党三心二意的态度。男一中六十多岁的老校长徐楚波在会上通过三反五反、肃反等几件具体事情，暴露了对共产党三心二意，对党的政策抽象拥护，一接触具体问题，尤其接触到和个人有关的问题时就有抵触情绪，并表示“把心交给党，和所有的同志在一起轻装跃进”。
    在开会期间，女十二中、六十一中、史家胡同等校教职员工向大会递交向党交心的决心书，女十四中教师代表还在大会上宣读了向党交心的挑战书。最后，中国教育工会全国委员会副主席冯宿海、中共北京市委会教育部副部长杨伯箴在会上讲了话。
