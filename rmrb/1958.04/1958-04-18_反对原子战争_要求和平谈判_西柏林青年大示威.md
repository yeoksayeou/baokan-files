Xinhua News Agency, Berlin, April 16th: Five thousand West Berlin youths held a silent march and demonstration on the evening of the 15th to protest atomic death. The march was jointly initiated by eighteen West Berlin youth organizations, including the "Eagle Troupe" and the Free German Youth League. The ranks of demonstrators stretched for several kilometers. The youths held aloft placards with slogans such as: "Oppose Atomic War!" "Young Socialists Support the Rapacki Plan!" "Negotiate!" "Hiroshima Warns Us!" "Berlin Youth Oppose Atomic Death!"

    As the marching column proceeded along the bustling streets, it was warmly applauded by the citizens, and a large number of citizens joined the march.

    The marchers finally entered the West Berlin Radio Tower Exhibition Hall, where a demonstration meeting was held. Speakers at the meeting unanimously condemned the Bonn government's atomic armament policy. Their speeches were warmly welcomed by the youth.

    The West Berlin authorities dispatched a large number of police and police cars to follow the marching column. Adenauer's Christian Democratic Union also sent a large number of troublemakers mixed in the marching column to distribute leaflets or hurl abuse at the demonstrators.

    反对原子战争　要求和平谈判
    西柏林青年大示威
    据新华社柏林16日电　西柏林五千名青年在15日晚上举行了沉默游行和示威大会，反对原子死亡。这次游行是由“鹰团”和自由德国青年联盟等十八个西柏林青年组织共同发起的。示威者的行列绵延好几公里。青年们高举着这样的标语：“反对原子战争！”“青年社会主义者支持腊帕茨基计划！”“谈判吧！”“广岛警告我们！”“柏林青年反对原子死亡！”
    当游行队伍在热闹的大街上行进时，受到了市民的热烈鼓掌，并且有大批市民参加了游行行列。
    游行队伍最后进入了西柏林无线电铁塔展览厅，在那里举行了示威大会。在会上演说的人一致谴责了波恩政府的原子备战政策。他们的讲话受到青年们的热烈欢迎。
    西柏林当局出动了大批警察和警车尾随在游行队伍后面。阿登纳的基督教民主联盟也派出了大批捣乱分子混在游行队伍里散发传单，或是对游行者进行谩骂。
