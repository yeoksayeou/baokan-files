Our reporters, Feng Jianwei and Yang Yi, visited the mountainous area of southern Lüliang Mountain in Shanxi's Xi County this spring. Everywhere we went, we heard praises for a rare and wonderful event: the introduction of superior breed of Big Yellow Ox from the plains of southern Shanxi to the western mountains, to improve the local small mountain oxen.

Two Different Pictures

On the hillsides, riverbanks, fields, and in the stalls, regardless of the quantity, all the oxen could be divided into two types at a glance, creating two distinctly different pictures.

One type of ox is small and weak. Some oxen are yoked in pairs, but they stagger and struggle when pulling a wooden plow. Sometimes even three oxen are yoked together, and they still can't pull a double-shared plow. This is the local mountain ox. This type of ox eats a lot, but it isn't worth much even after being raised for many years, and it doesn't yield much meat when slaughtered. The farmers are not interested in this type of ox, describing it as: "Small head, thin waist, short stature, weak body with no strength, if it weren't for the yellowish color of its fur, you might mistake it for an old sheep." Some farmers who raise these oxen do not profit, lamenting: "Thin legs, short waist, small head, I can't sell it even after going to several markets. I feed it for a year and several months, and no one will give me three or five yuan." It's true: they want to raise oxen when they don't have them, but they get angry when they do.

The other type of ox is a calf improved by the Big Yellow breed from the plains. These are completely different. These oxen are fat, strong, and full of energy. Although they are young, their size is outstanding. Standing together for comparison, a three-year-old improved ox is more than twice the size of a four-year-old local mountain ox. This type of ox is easy to use, and one can pull a double-shared plow for farming. The farmers love this type of ox, praising it as: "Flat horns, stacked hooves, five shorts (short legs, short neck) and one long (long torso), all neatly formed, tail raised like a flag." A member of the Xia Li Township Agricultural Cooperative composed a jingle, singing the praises of improved breeds: "What kind of seeds, what kind of seedlings, good seeds grow good gourds. Improved ox breeds grow big, pulling plows and harrows like racing horses. Develop production and increase income, support national industrialization. Change all the breeds of cattle, sheep, pigs, and chickens, and there is a way to improve life."

Experiment After Experiment

A painter might not find it too difficult to paint these two pictures, but, in terms of work, transforming the old ways into the new, from a work perspective, this was a tortuous and extraordinary process. The work of improving draft cattle began in 1953. At that time, the Xi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party convened cadres from the agricultural, forestry, and animal husbandry departments to study the causes of the degeneration of mountain cattle and the measures for improvement. They found that the fundamental reason for the degeneration of mountain cattle was the long-term practice of mixed grazing and uncontrolled early mating. According to the investigation materials at that time, among the 922 cows that underwent uncontrolled early mating, abortions and dead calves accounted for a quarter, and the calves that were born were not well-formed. After clarifying the reasons, what measures should be taken? The county committee proposed to first focus on experimentation.

The first experiment was conducted in 1953. The county selected twelve experimental points, selected and retained twelve good bulls from the local cattle population for specialized mating, changing the local habit of mixed grazing and uncontrolled early mating. Throughout the year, 728 cows were mated, and the calf survival rate in the second year reached 95%, which was one-fifth higher than the calf survival rate of the 922 cows that underwent uncontrolled mating. The results of two consecutive years of experiments showed that the quality of the calves had improved significantly, but due to the poor quality of the breeding bulls, the rate of quality improvement was very slow. To solve the problem of breeding bulls, in 1955, fourteen Big Yellow cattle breeding animals were introduced from the plains of southern Shanxi for key experiments in twelve agricultural cooperatives and two veterinary stations with many cows, good feeding conditions, and serious problems with uncontrolled early mating. In that year, a total of 588 cows were mated, the conception rate reached 98.8%, and the calf survival rate reached 96.7%. The calves were fat and large. This experiment of introducing superior breeds into the mountains fired the first shot, creating a good start for the county's draft cattle to be improved.

From the accustomed uncontrolled mating to paying high prices to purchase superior breeds for mating, this was a epoch-making transformation in the history of cattle raising in Xi County. Initially, the farmers simply did not believe that foreign cattle could mate with local cattle, and later no one wanted to pay for breeding bulls or to pay to mate cows. In response to this situation, Xi County decided to break the deadlock gradually by organizing visits to typical examples, comparing good and bad examples, and starting with ideological education, experimenting and promoting at the same time.

The resistance encountered by the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative in Xiali Township, which was the earliest to experiment, was enough to illustrate the situation. After the cooperative director brought back the Big Yellow breeding bull from the county, many thoughts of resistance were generated from the cadres to the masses, which can be summarized into seven fears: first, fear of losing face as a breeding expert; second, fear of not being able to marry a wife; third, fear of not having cows to mate; fourth, fear of not receiving mating fees; fifth, fear of losing money because the plains cattle are difficult to feed in the mountains; sixth, fear that the plains cattle are not suitable for mountainous use; seventh, fear that the bull is large and the cow is small, causing dystocia and accidents. In response to these thoughts, the Party branch made two calculations for everyone: one was that although the Big Yellow breeding bull was expensive, if it mated with 80 cows throughout the year, the fees could earn back the cost; the second was that although it cost three yuan to mate a cow, a superior breed calf could be sold for at least ten yuan, in addition to the greater benefits of improving agricultural production and changing the face of the mountainous area. Initially, no one wanted to be a breeder. After activist Ding Youyuan took on this work, his whole family complained, his wife quarreled, his father-in-law broke off contact with him, and the gossips in the village called him "Grandpa Bull." After the cooperative director repeatedly encouraged and educated him, and sent him to participate in the county's breeding technology conference, his confidence was strengthened. Just like the Dongfanghong Agricultural Cooperative, the first batch of twelve breeding base points in the county, through signing contracts, drove the breeding bulls to the temple fairs for publicity, and sent them to the door for mating. In the first year, fourteen Big Yellow breeding bulls mated with 581 cows, accounting for 74% of the local eligible cows. In the second year (1956), 588 cows were mated, the conception rate reached 98%, and the calf survival rate reached 96%. At this point, the experiment of using Yellow cattle breeding livestock for reproduction was declared a success.

A New Path of Development

Before introducing Yellow cattle breeding livestock into the mountains, Xi County, like other mountainous areas, had not mastered the approach to solving the contradiction between production development and insufficient draft power. At that time, they always thought that having more was better than having none, and that having more was better than having less, blindly developing quantity. As a result, many mated, but few conceived; many calves were born, but few survived; and the quality of draft animals degenerated significantly, becoming worse with each generation.

After the successful experiment of mating Big Yellow cattle from the plains in 1955, a new path was presented for solving the difficulty of insufficient draft animals - solving the problem of insufficient quantity by improving the quality of draft animals. Based on this new experience, the Xi County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party decided to expand the breed improvement, promoting the experimental results throughout the county. Therefore, they dispatched strong cadres to twelve cooperatives such as Yiquan and Huanzhu to cultivate typical examples, creating a complete set of breeding and management experiences such as bull health care, castration of inferior cattle, training of breeding staff, and four cleans (clean grass, clean feed, clean water, clean troughs) and five fixes (fixed grass, fixed feed, fixed labor, fixed condition, regular inspections). The county immediately divided into five key points, organizing agricultural cooperative cadres, veteran farmers, breeders, and mating staff to visit and compare. The county held an exhibition of improved draft animals, which dispelled the concerns of many people who had doubts, convinced them of the Jinan Big Yellow cattle, and they immediately ordered breeding bulls. The county quickly developed to fifty-four Big Yellow breeding bulls.

While vigorously promoting the mating of superior livestock, castrating local inferior breed bulls, stopping uncontrolled mating, and appropriately selecting and breeding within the population are also effective measures for Xi County to improve the quality of draft cattle and curb breed degeneration.

Improving the quality of draft cattle is a revolutionary measure related to the production and life of the entire county. Xi County has consistently implemented the approach of the whole Party mobilizing and close cooperation between departments from beginning to end. The supply and marketing cooperative sent cadres to southern Shanxi to assist in purchasing Big Yellow cattle breeds, the bank provided loans of 3,000 yuan to solve financial difficulties, the grain bureau promptly supplied feed for breeding livestock, and the food company vigorously purchased thin and weak old cattle eliminated from various places. This ensured that: breeding bulls were supplied in a timely manner, there was feed for raising cattle, and there were breeding bulls for mating. Veterinary personnel made great contributions to improving draft cattle. When the Big Yellow cattle were driven up the mountains after a long journey, they immediately checked them separately, and if they found any illness, they immediately treated them, eliminating the possibility of epidemic diseases in the breeding bulls. Then they divided their work to look after the troughs and protect the livestock, regularly inspected them, and passed on technology. They successively trained fifty veterinary technicians and sixty-three mating technicians, and also guided the improvement of feeding management. In order to systematically investigate the improvement, they separately tried pedigree registration cards in five cooperatives such as Wucheng and Qianjiazhuang, preparing data for accurate scientific research work.

In the agricultural cooperatives responsible for raising and protecting breeding bulls, a series of reception preparations were also made. Each cooperative handed over the breeding livestock to the most experienced people, who were specifically responsible for feeding them and promptly solved the problems of frost protection equipment and fodder. And they implemented the quota remuneration method for breeding livestock feeding and management, stipulating that each bull fed would be recorded as two work points per day, each four cattle mated would be recorded as ten work points, each calf born would be recorded as eighty work points, and each twenty loads of manure accumulated would be recorded as eight work points. If mating was provided to cooperatives outside the cooperative, they would be rewarded with 25% to 30% of the mating fee, which greatly stimulated the labor enthusiasm of the feeding and management personnel. The county's breeding livestock all reached the point of being strong and sturdy, almost every cow mated conceived, and every young animal survived.

A Sensation in the Lüliang Mountains

So far, the number of improved calves in Xi County has reached more than 55% of the existing 11,000 mountain cattle. Every township in the county has a Big Yellow cattle mating station, with an average of one superior breeding bull for every seventy cows, forming a county-wide superior breed mating and breeding network. At the same time, agricultural cooperatives have prohibited mixed grazing and uncontrolled mating, and have also established a set of management systems. The local inferior breed bulls have all been castrated, and the phenomenon of uncontrolled mating has been eradicated. The backward phenomenon of degeneration in the quality of mountain cattle throughout the county has been fundamentally changed.

According to recent survey materials from the county committee, the conception rate of mating with Big Yellow cattle is generally 20% to 30% higher than that of uncontrolled mating with local inferior breed cattle, and the calf survival rate is about 25% higher. The first generation of Big Yellow cattle mating calves - 1,987 improved calves - appeared particularly magnificent. Generally, the superior breed calves have large heads, broad chests, strong hooves and legs, shiny coats, vigorous spirits, and are worth two to three times more than inferior breed calves. The results of calf body measurements conducted in Junzhuang and Shangzhuang show that the superior breed calves are on average 30% taller, 30% to 40% longer, more than 10% wider in chest circumference, and weigh twice as much as inferior breed calves.

Farmers in Xi County are accustomed to using cattle, and cattle are the main driving force for local farming. The Jinan Big Yellow cattle went up the mountains, the local inferior breed cattle were castrated, and the draft cattle in Xi County have greatly changed. As soon as the news of the victory spread, it immediately caused a sensation in the Lüliang Mountains. In fact, the impact of Xi County's improved draft cattle breeds has far exceeded the Lüliang Mountains. So far, 94 counties in Shanxi Province have sent representatives to visit and study here.

### 大黄牛上了吕梁山

    大黄牛上了吕梁山
    本报记者　冯建韦、杨义
    今年春天，记者访问吕梁山南麓重峰叠岭的山西隰县时，到处听到一件众口赞扬的稀罕事：晋南平川的大黄牛优种搬上西山，改良了当地的小山牛。
    两幅不同的图画
    在山坡、在河岸、在田野、在槽圈，不管数量有多少，但是所有的牛一看就能分出两种类型，构成了两种迥然不同的图画。
    一种牛个子小、很瘦弱。有的牛两头合一犋，拉上木犁还摇摇晃晃，走动很吃力；甚至三头套在一起，还拉不动双铧犁。这就是当地的山牛。这种牛挺能吃，但养上好多年不值几个钱，杀了也得不到多少肉。农民们对这种牛很不感兴趣，形容它是：“头小腰细个子低，身体瘦弱没力气，不是皮毛色发黄，差点看成老绵羊”。有的农民养牛得不上利，望牛兴叹说：“腿细腰短头又小，几次上会卖不了，喂上一年几个月，三元五元没人要”。真是：没牛想养牛，养上气破肚。
    另一种是用平川大黄种牛改良的牛犊，情况则完全两样。这种牛又肥又壮，精力充沛。虽然口齿小，个头却很出众，站在一块比较一下，三岁的优种牛比四岁的当地山牛大一倍还多。这种牛使用起来得心应手，一头就能拖上双铧犁耕作。农民们十分喜爱这种牛，夸奖它是：“扁担角、堆堆蹄，五短（四腿短脖子短）一长（腰身长）生的齐，尾巴翘起像杆旗”。下李乡农业社社员编了一首顺口溜，歌唱改良牛种是：“什么籽、什么苗，种好葫芦结好瓢。牛种改良长的大，拉上犁耙赛马跑，搞好生产收入大，支援国家工业化，牛羊猪鸡都换种，改善生活有办法。”
    试验再试验
    画家画这两幅画也许不太费事，但是，从过去的老样子变成现在的新样子，从工作上说那可是一段曲折的不平凡的过程。开始进行改良耕牛工作，是在1953年。那时，中共隰县委员会曾召集农林畜牧部门干部研究了山牛退化的原因和改良措施。找到了山牛退化的根本原因是长期以来混群放牧，野交早配所造成。根据当时的调查材料，野交早配的九百二十二头母牛，流产和死犊达到了四分之一，生下的牛犊都不成个样子。明确原因之后，究竟采取什么措施呢？县委提出先重点试验。
    第一次试验在1953年，全县选择了十二个试验点，从当地牛群中选留下十二头好公牛进行专种交配，改变了当地混群放牧、野交早配的习惯，全年交配母牛七百二十八头，第二年产犊成活率达到95％，比野交乱配的九百二十二头产犊成活多了五分之一。从连续两年的试验的结果看，小牛质量有显著提高，但是，由于种牛质量不好，提高质量的速度很缓慢。为了解决种牛的问题，1955年开始从晋南平川引进十四头大黄牛种畜，在母牛多、饲养条件好、野交早配严重的十二个农业社和两个兽医站进行重点试验。当年共交配了五百八十八头母牛，受胎率达到98.8％，产犊成活率达到了96.7％，牛犊又肥又大。这次引优种上山的试验打响了第一炮，为全县耕牛优种化创造一个良好的开端。
    从习以为常的野交乱配，到出高价远道购买优种配种，这是隰县养牛史上划时代的大变革。开始农民们根本不相信外地牛能和本地牛交配，后来谁也不愿意出钱买种牛，花钱给母牛配种。针对这种情况，隰县决定通过参观典型，好坏对比算账，从进行思想教育入手、边试验边推广，逐渐打开僵持局面。
    最早试验的下李乡东方红农业社受到的阻力，足可以说明一斑。当社主任从县里拉回大黄种公牛以后，从干部到群众产生了许多抵触思想，归纳起来有七怕：一怕当配种行家丢人，二怕娶不下老婆，三怕没有母牛来配种，四怕收不到配种费，五怕平川牛上山不好喂赔了本，六怕平川牛不适合山地用，七怕公牛大、母牛小，难产出事故。针对这些思想，党支部向大家算了两笔账：一笔是，虽然大黄种牛贵，如果全年交配八十头母牛，一年收费就可赚回本钱；第二笔是，虽然配一头母牛出三元配种费，可是生一头优种牛犊至少能卖十块钱，另外，对提高农业生产、改变山区面貌的好处更多。最初谁也不当配种员，积极分子丁有元担负了这项工作后，全家人纷纷埋怨，老婆吵闹，岳父和他断绝了来往，村里爱说风凉话的人，都说他当了“牛外爷”了。经过社主任多次鼓励教育，并派他参加县里的配种技术会议，才坚定了他的信心。就像东方红农业社一样，全县第一批十二个配种基点，通过签订合同，把种牛赶到庙会上宣传，送到门上去配种，头一年十四头大黄种牛配种了五百八十一头，占当地适龄母牛的74％。第二年（1956年）配种五百八十八头，受胎率达到98％，产犊成活率达96％。至此，引用黄牛种畜繁殖的试验便宣告成功了。
    新的发展道路
    隰县，在未引用黄牛种畜上山前，也和其他山区一样，并没有掌握解决生产发展和畜力不足的矛盾的门径。那时，总认为有了比没有强，多了比少了好，一味发展数量。结果，交配的多，怀犊的少，生犊的多，成活的少，而且耕畜质量显著退化，一代不如一代。
    1955年试验平川大黄牛配种成功以后，给解决耕畜不足的困难摆出一条新的道路——通过提高耕畜质量，相对解决数量不足的道路。根据这个新的经验，中共隰县县委会决定扩大进行品种改良，把试验成果推广到全县，于是，派出较强的干部到义泉、环珠等十二个社培养典型，创造公牛保健、劣牛阉割、训练繁畜员和四净（草净、料净、水净、槽净）五定（定草、定料、定工、定膘、定期检查）等一套完整的配种和管理经验。全县立即分五个重点，组织农业社干部、老农、饲养员和配种员参观评比，县里举行改良耕畜的展览会，这样就使很多怀有疑虑的人打消了顾虑，信服了晋南大黄牛，当场就纷纷订购种牛，全县一下发展到五十四头大黄种牛。
    与大力推广优畜配种的同时，阉割本地劣种公牛，停止野交乱配，并且适当的就群选种繁殖，也是隰县改善耕牛质量，遏止品种退化的另一个有效措施。
    改善耕牛质量是关系全县人民的生产和生活的革命性的措施。隰县自始至终，都贯彻全党动手、各部门密切配合的作法。供销合作社派干部到晋南协助购买大黄牛种，银行贷款三千元解决资金困难，粮食局及时供应种畜饲料，食品公司大力收购各地淘汰的瘦弱老牛。这就作到了：种牛供应及时，养牛有料，配种有种牛。兽医人员对改良耕牛有着很大贡献。当大黄牛经过长途劳顿赶上山后，他们立即分头检查，发现病情，马上就医，根绝种牛发生疫病。接着他们又分工看槽保畜，定期检查，传授技术，先后培养了五十个兽医技术员，六十三个配种技术员，还指导改善饲养管理。为了系统地考察改良情况，分别在午城、千家庄等五个社，试行谱系登记卡片，给精确的科学研究工作准备了资料。
    在负责养护种牛的农业社里，也作了一系列的接待准备工作。各社都把种畜交给最有经验的人，专门负责喂养，及时解决防冻设备和饲草问题。并且实行了种畜饲养和管理定额报酬办法，规定每喂一头公牛，一天记二分工，每配四个牛记十分工，每产一犊记八十分工、每积二十担粪记八分工。如给社外配种，则以配种费的25％到30％奖励他们，这样就大大刺激了饲养和管理人员们的劳动积极性，全县种畜都达到膘实体壮、交配的母牛几乎头头受胎，个个幼畜成活。
      轰动吕梁山
    到目前为止，隰县改良牛犊已达到了现有山牛一万一千多头的55％多。全县乡乡有了大黄牛配种站，平均每七十头母牛，有了一头优良种牛，已经形成了一个遍布全县的优种配种繁殖网。同时，各农业社禁止混群放牧和野交早配，也已建立一套管理制度。本地的劣种公牛已经全部进行阉割，野交乱配现象已经根绝。全县山牛质量退化的落后现象已经基本改变。
    根据县委最近的调查材料，用大黄牛配种，受胎率一般比当地劣种牛野交乱配高20％到30％，牛犊成活率高25％左右。大黄牛配种的第一代牛犊——一千九百八十七头改良牛犊，显得格外壮观。一般的优种犊头大、胸宽、蹄腿壮、毛色光润、精神健旺，价值高过劣种犊两倍到三倍。君庄和上庄进行牛犊体测的结果表明，优种牛犊比劣种牛犊平均身高30％，身长多30％到40％，胸围宽10％以上，体重多一倍。
    隰县农民习惯使用牛，牛是当地耕作的主要动力。晋南大黄牛上了山，本地的劣种牛割了旦，隰县耕牛大变样，胜利消息一传出，马上就轰动吕梁山。事实上，隰县改良耕牛品种的影响，已经远远超出了吕梁山，到目前为止，山西省已经有九十四个县派代表来到这里参观学习。（附图片）
