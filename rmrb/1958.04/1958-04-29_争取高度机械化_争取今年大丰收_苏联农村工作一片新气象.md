Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 27th—As spring plowing work unfolds in various regions, a massive and meticulous reorganization of machine tractor stations is underway throughout the Soviet countryside. This reorganization measure has brought about changes in all aspects of rural work and has achieved initial results.

Currently, collective farms are purchasing agricultural machinery. Some farms have already purchased tractors before the spring plowing. For example, among the more than 1,000 farms in the Moscow region, more than 600 have bought all the tractors needed by the farm before the spring plowing. Two-thirds of the farms in Latvia have purchased machinery. Some farms in some areas were unable to purchase machinery before the spring plowing but plan to purchase agricultural machinery successively within this year after the spring plowing.

Machine tractor stations are also being reorganized, with some being converted into technical repair stations, some being abolished, and some continuing to be retained. For example, the Kubyshev Oblast originally had 61 machine tractor stations. After this reorganization, 28 technical repair stations and 19 repair substations have been established. Another 34 machine tractor stations continue to be retained to serve collective farms that cannot purchase machinery.

The number of regions entering spring plowing production is increasing daily. The slogan put forward by farms everywhere is "Make good use of the new technology!" "Strive for a higher degree of mechanization, strive for a bumper harvest this year!" Preliminary experience shows that farms are better at mastering and utilizing machinery than machine tractor stations. For example, in the Dzhankoy district of the Crimean Oblast, the machine utilization rate of machine tractor stations has been 72% to 80% for many years. Now, the machine utilization rate has increased by 10% to 13% compared to the past. The spring plowing time for farms is also shorter than in the past. The tractor drivers, who have returned to their farms in large numbers, are responsible not only for the quantity of land plowed but also for the quality of plowing.

With the reorganization, the leadership and the strength of the Party organizations in the farms have been greatly strengthened. For example, Kubyshev Oblast has newly elected 70 farm chairmen in the last three months, many of whom were originally the heads of machine tractor stations. A large number of Party members from machine tractor stations have transferred to work in farms, enhancing the strength of farm Party organizations. In the Pkhvistnevsky district of Kubyshev Oblast, 150 Party members have transferred from machine tractor stations to work in farms, increasing the number of Party members in the district's farms to more than 750.

As machinery is transferred to the hands of farms, the work of expanding farms is underway in the Soviet countryside. In the Nikolaev Oblast of Ukraine, 102 farms have already merged into 48 new farms before the spring plowing. Kubyshev Oblast has merged another 32 farms in the last month and a half.

Another task currently in the countryside is the establishment of repair workshops in the farms. Many farms are building small repair stations to carry out repairs in a timely manner. Many industrial enterprises are trying to help farms establish repair workshops.

### 争取高度机械化  争取今年大丰收  苏联农村工作一片新气象

    争取高度机械化  争取今年大丰收
    苏联农村工作一片新气象
    新华社莫斯科27日电　与春耕工作在各地展开的同时，一个规模巨大、过程细致的改组机器拖拉机站的工作正在苏联各地农村进行着。这一改组措施已在农村各方面的工作中引起了改变，并且获得了初步的成效。
    目前，集体农庄购买农业机器的工作已经展开。有的农庄在春耕前已经购买了拖拉机。例如，莫斯科州的一千多个农庄中，已经有六百多个农庄在春耕前买好了全部农庄所需要的拖拉机。拉脱维亚有三分之二的农庄都购买了机器。有些地区的农庄不能在春耕前购买机器，但是准备在春耕后陆续在今年内购买农业机器。
    机器拖拉机站也在进行改组，一部分改组成技术修理站，一部分撤销，一部分继续保留。例如古比雪夫州原有六十一个机器拖拉机站，经过这次改组，已经成立了二十八个技术修理站和十九个修理分站，另有三十四个机器拖拉机站继续保留，以便为不能购买机器的集体农庄服务。
    现在进入春耕生产的地区逐日增多。各地农庄提出来的口号是“要很好地利用新得来的技术！”“争取更高度的机械化，争取今年的大丰收！”初步的经验表明，农庄掌握和利用机器的情况比机器拖拉机站好。例如，在克里米亚州德让斯克区，机器拖拉机站的机器利用率多年来都是72％到80％，现在机器利用率比以前提高了10％到13％。农庄的春耕时间也比过去缩短。已经大批地回到自己的农庄的拖拉机手们，不仅对翻耕土地的数量、而且也对翻耕的质量负责。
    随着改组的进行，农庄的领导力量和党组织的力量已经大大加强。例如古比雪夫州在最近三月内新选了七十个农庄主席，其中有许多农庄主席是原来的机器拖拉机站站长。机器拖拉机站大批党员转到农庄工作，增强了农庄党组织的力量。古比雪夫州波赫维斯特?夫区从机器拖拉机站转到农庄工作的党员有一百五十人，使全区农庄党员数目增加到七百五十多人。
    随着机器转到农庄手中，苏联农村中正在进行扩大农庄的工作。乌克兰尼古拉耶夫州已经有一百零二个农庄在春耕前合并成四十八个新农庄。古比雪夫州在最近一个半月内又合并了三十二个农庄。
    当前农村中另一个工作是在农庄中建立修理工场的问题。许多农庄都在建立小型修理站，以便及时进行修理工作。许多工业企业都在设法帮助农庄建立修理工场。
