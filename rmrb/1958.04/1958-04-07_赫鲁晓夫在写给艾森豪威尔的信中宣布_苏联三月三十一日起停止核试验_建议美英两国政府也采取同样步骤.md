Xinhua News Agency, 6th -- TASS reports: Soviet Council of Ministers Chairman Khrushchev, in a letter to U.S. President Eisenhower, announced that, in order to implement the recent resolution passed by the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, the Soviet government has decided to unilaterally cease any type of atomic and hydrogen weapon testing from March 31st of this year.

The letter stated that the Soviet government suggests that the U.S. and British governments also take similar steps.

Khrushchev's letter was delivered to U.S. Secretary of State Dulles on April 4th by Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Menshikov.

Khrushchev said in the letter that one of the most pressing issues in international relations today is the immediate cessation of testing of all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons. The continuous testing explosions of nuclear weapons are causing deep unease among all levels of residents, which is easy to understand, because such tests intensify the arms race, promote the research of new, more destructive and lethal nuclear weapons, thereby increasingly deepening the threat of atomic war faced by mankind; moreover, it also brings harm to the health of peaceful residents in various countries.

The Soviet government, considering all of this, concludes that the solution to the issue of stopping nuclear weapon testing can no longer be delayed.

The letter pointed out that today only the Soviet Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom possess nuclear weapons, so an agreement to stop nuclear weapon testing is relatively easy to reach.

The letter then stated that in the past three years, the Soviet government has repeatedly suggested to the U.S. and British governments that they stop testing atomic and hydrogen weapons. Despite all these efforts, it is regrettable that no agreement has been reached so far on resolving the issue of unconditionally and immediately stopping nuclear weapon testing, or even temporarily stopping it.

In order to provide a practical beginning to the universal cessation of testing atomic and hydrogen weapons, thereby taking the first step in completely eliminating the threat of devastating atomic war for mankind, the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union decided that the Soviet Union will cease testing all types of atomic and hydrogen weapons. If the governments of countries currently possessing nuclear weapons support this suggestion from the Soviet Union and also make the decision to no longer conduct tests, then this issue that deeply disturbs the people of the world will finally be resolved, thereby taking a major step forward in establishing genuine trust between countries and consolidating peace.

However, if they are unwilling to respond to this resolution of the Soviet government and continue to conduct atomic and hydrogen weapon tests, then, in this situation, in order to safeguard its own security, the Soviet Union naturally has no choice but to consider itself no longer bound by the obligations it has undertaken regarding the cessation of nuclear testing. However, the Soviet government does not want this situation to occur.

Khrushchev said that the Soviet government believes that the Soviet Union and the United States were the first countries to manufacture atomic and hydrogen weapons and to stockpile such weapons in large quantities, and it would be very appropriate if they became the initiators of the noble cause of immediately stopping nuclear weapon testing. This would greatly promote the progress of the situation and facilitate the resolution of the task of completely freeing the people of all countries from the threat of atomic war. Moreover, stopping the testing of atomic and hydrogen weapons would greatly improve the overall international political atmosphere and create more favorable conditions for resolving other outstanding international issues.

Khrushchev finally expressed his hope that the aforementioned suggestions of the Soviet government would be actively treated by the U.S. government.

    赫鲁晓夫在写给艾森豪威尔的信中宣布
    苏联三月三十一日起停止核试验
    建议美英两国政府也采取同样步骤
    新华社6日讯　据塔斯社报道：苏联部长会议主席赫鲁晓夫在写给美国总统艾森豪威尔的一封信中宣布，苏联政府为了执行苏联最高苏维埃最近通过的决议，决定从今年3月31日起单方面停止任何类型的原子武器和氢武器试验。
    信中说，苏联政府建议美国和英国政府也采取同样的步骤。
    赫鲁晓夫的信已经由苏联驻美国大使缅希科夫在4月4日交给美国国务卿杜勒斯。
    赫鲁晓夫在信中说，今天国际关系最迫切的问题之一，是必须立即停止试验各种类型的原子武器和氢武器。不断进行的核武器试验性爆炸在各阶层居民中间引起深切的不安，这是容易理解的。因为这种试验加剧着军备竞赛，促进研究新的、破坏性和杀伤力更大的核武器，从而日益加深人类所面临的原子战争的威胁；此外，它还给各国和平居民的健康带来损害。
    苏联政府考虑到这一切，得出结论，认为停止核武器试验的问题的解决再不能拖延下去了。
    信中指出，今天还只有苏联、美国和英国拥有核武器，所以停止核武器试验的协议是比较容易达成的。
    信中接着说，最近三年来苏联政府曾经不止一次地向美国和英国政府建议停止试验原子武器和氢武器。尽管作了这一切努力，遗憾的是，在解决无条件立即停止核武器试验的问题方面，甚至是暂时停止方面迄今都未能达成协议。
    苏联最高苏维埃为了给普遍停止试验原子武器和氢武器打开一个实际开端，从而在使人类彻底免除毁灭性原子战争威胁方面迈出第一步，决定苏联停止试验各种类型的原子武器和氢武器。如果目前拥有核武器的各国政府支持苏联的这项建议，也采取不再进行试验的决定，那么，使全世界人民深感不安的这个问题就会终于得到解决，从而在建立各国之间的真正信任和巩固和平方面前进一大步。
    但是，如果它们不愿意响应苏联政府的这个决议，而继续进行原子武器和氢武器试验，那么，在这种情况下，苏联为了保障本国的安全，自然别无出路，只能认为自己不再受所承担的、关于停止核试验的义务的约束。然而苏联政府不希望出现这种局面。
    赫鲁晓夫说，苏联政府认为，苏联和美国是首先制造原子武器和氢武器并且大量储备这种武器的国家，如果它们成为立即停止核武器试验这一崇高事业的倡议者，那是非常适宜的。这将在很大的程度上推动事态的进展，促进各国人民完全摆脱原子战争威胁这一任务的解决。而且，停止试验原子武器和氢武器将会大大地改善整个国际政治气氛并为解决其他悬而未决的国际问题创造更有利的条件。
    赫鲁晓夫最后希望苏联政府的上述建议能够受到美国政府的积极的对待。
