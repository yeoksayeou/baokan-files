Liu Lianren, the Motherland Supports You
　　——A Record of Compatriot Liu Lianren's Return to Tianjin New Port
　　By Our Reporters Liu Zhongping and Shi Jian

　　One and One Hundred and Forty-Eight
　　The ship slowly approached the shore. Standing on the mid-deck of the ship was a tall man, wearing a black felt hat and a grey suit. People on the dock quickly recognized him as Liu Lianren. His photograph, taken after he was discovered in Japan, had appeared more than once in newspapers across China.

　　The people of the motherland have shown great sympathy and concern for the fourteen years of suffering he endured in Japan. After the news spread that he would return to Tianjin New Port on the 15th, thousands of people gathered at the dock today to welcome him.

　　He took off his hat and waved vigorously to the crowd on the dock. The people on the dock also greeted him with warm applause, congratulating him on his return to the motherland.

　　But the applause quickly subsided, because people knew that along with Liu Lianren, there were also the ashes and memorial tablets of one hundred and forty-eight compatriots who had been abducted to Japan during the Japanese war of aggression against China to engage in forced labor. What can we congratulate them on? They will never see the new motherland again! Facing each box of ashes and each memorial tablet brought down from the ship by representatives of soldiers and workers, we could only bow our heads in silent mourning.

　　Since liberation, we have welcomed eight shipments of remains of anti-Japanese martyrs from Japan at Tianjin New Port. But Liu Lianren is the only survivor.

　　And Liu Lianren's return home was due to the just public opinion of the Japanese people and Japanese friendly organizations, and the struggle of overseas Chinese in Japan. If it weren't for Japan sending a ship to transport returning Japanese citizens, Liu Lianren's return home might have been delayed indefinitely. The discovery of Liu Lianren gives us reason to suspect that there are still similar compatriots suffering in Japan.

　　"Painful Memories"
　　When the ship had not yet entered the port, people gathered on the dock, talking about Liu Lianren's experience, which also evoked their own painful memories. During the Japanese war of aggression against China, Tianjin New Port was an important port for Japan to transport laborers.

　　Many old workers who have worked at the port for more than ten years have witnessed batches of Chinese compatriots being transported to Japan. Many people's relatives were captured and have not been found to this day. Fan Shanghou, a fifty-three-year-old worker, and others told reporters excitedly that when the Japanese militarists were in New Port, they used several barbed wire fences and power grids to encircle a "human pen." Every day, thousands of Chinese compatriots were captured and brought in. Many compatriots were tortured to death. Bai Yuling, a young stevedore, said that his brother died in the New Port "human pen," and their team leader escaped from the "human pen." Among these dockworkers, you can easily find many eyewitnesses of the Japanese army's capture and persecution of compatriots, and even victims themselves. Many people said that the Japanese army took away so many of our people in the past, and we will never agree unless the Japanese government makes a specific account today. If the Japanese government wants to deny it, hundreds of thousands of people in Tanggu are witnesses.

　　"I Came Back Smiling"
　　Today, the people gathered at the dock to welcome Liu Lianren and the remains of the martyred heroes were almost all filled with complex emotions - joy, sorrow, and indignation. Liu Lianren's family - his wife, his son whom he had never met, and his fourth younger brother, were probably even more so. When Liu Lianren walked down the gangway from the ship, they excitedly welcomed him, but when his wife and his child grabbed his arm, they couldn't help but burst into tears.

　　The grief was quickly overwhelmed by the welcome and encouragement of the masses. In front of the New Port Seamen's Club, all sectors of the people in Tanggu District prepared a grand welcome meeting for Liu Lianren. When Liu Lianren stepped onto the rostrum, he first bowed deeply to the portrait of Chairman Mao hanging on the stage. This bow contained his sincere gratitude to the people of the motherland.

　　In his speech, Liu Lianren used ironclad facts to denounce the crimes of Japanese militarism and expressed his gratitude for the support of the Japanese people. He firmly demanded that the Japanese government compensate him for all his losses. He cheered for the strength of the motherland. He said excitedly, when I left, I left crying. I came back smiling. Wan Ying, a representative of all sectors of Tanggu District, expressed sincere condolences to Liu Lianren in his speech. He expressed full support for Liu Lianren's just struggle. He lodged a solemn protest against the Kishi Nobusuke government.

　　Liu Lianren has returned to the motherland! On the first day he set foot on the land of the motherland, he heard the enthusiastic slogans shouted by his compatriots: "Compatriot Liu Lianren, the people of the motherland are supporting you!" This is the end of Liu Lianren's suffering and the beginning of his happiness.

    刘连仁，祖国人民支持你
　　——记难胞刘连仁返抵天津新港
    本报记者　刘仲平　石坚
    一个和一百四十八个
    船慢慢的靠岸了。船的中部甲板上站着一个身材高大的人，戴一顶黑呢帽，穿一身灰西服。码头上的人们很快地认出了他就是刘连仁。他在日本被发现以后的照片，已经不止一次地登在我国各地的报纸上。
    祖国人民对他在日本遭受的十四年苦难，寄予了极大的同情和关心。他将在15日返抵天津新港的消息传出以后，今天码头上聚集着成千的人前来欢迎他。
    他摘下了帽子，用力地挥舞着，向码头上的人群致意。码头上的人们也用热烈的掌声祝贺他返回祖国。
    但是掌声很快地停下来了，因为人们知道同刘连仁一起回来的，还有在日本侵华战争期间，被劫掠到日本，从事奴役劳动的一百四十八名难胞的骨灰和灵牌。我们能向他们祝贺什么呢？他们已经再也看不到新生的祖国了！面对着战士和工人的代表从船上捧下来的每匣骨灰和每个灵牌，我们只有低下头来默致哀悼。
    解放后，我们在天津新港码头上，已经迎接了八次从日本运送回来的抗日烈士遗骨。但生还的只有刘连仁一个人。
    而刘连仁的回国，还是靠了日本人民、日本友好团体的正义舆论和我国旅日侨胞的斗争促成的。如果不是日本派船来接运回归日侨，刘连仁的归国还说不定要拖到什么时候呢。刘连仁的被发现，使我们有理由怀疑在日本是不是还有同样的难胞在忍受苦难。
    “痛苦的记忆”
    当轮船还未进港的时候，聚集在码头上的人在谈论刘连仁的遭遇时，也勾起了自己的痛苦记忆。在日本侵华战争时期，天津新港是日本运送劳工的一个重要港口。
    许多在港口工作十几年的老工人，都曾亲眼看见我国的同胞被一批一批地运往日本。许多人的亲人被抓走以后，一直到现在还没有下落，五十三岁的老工人范尚候等激动地告诉记者，日本军国主义在新港的时候，用几道铁丝网、电网圈成一个“人圈”。每天都有数以千百计的中国同胞被抓进来。许多同胞被虐待致死。青年装卸工人白玉岭说，他的哥哥就是死在新港“人圈”里的，而他们的队长则是从“人圈”里逃出来的。在这些码头工人中，你可以毫不费力地找到许多日军抓捕、残害同胞的目击者，甚至亲身受害人。许多人都说，日本军队过去抓走了我们那么些人，今天日本政府不作出具体交代，我们决不答应。日本政府如果想抵赖，十几万塘沽人民都是见证人。“我是笑着回来的”
    今天聚集在码头迎接刘连仁和殉难烈士遗骨的人，差不多都是怀着一种复杂的感情——高兴、沉痛而又愤慨。刘连仁的家属——他的妻子，他还没有见过一面的儿子和他的四弟，恐怕更是如此。当刘连仁从船上扶梯走下来的时候，他们兴奋的迎上前去，但当他妻子和他的孩子拉着他的胳膊的时候，他们却禁不住失声痛哭了。
    悲痛很快的就被群众的欢迎和鼓励压过了。在新港海员俱乐部前面，塘沽区各界人民为刘连仁准备了一个盛大的欢迎会。当刘连仁登上主席台的时候，他首先向挂在台上的毛主席像深深地鞠了一躬。这一鞠躬里包含了他对祖国人民真诚的感谢。
    刘连仁在讲话中，用铁一般的事实，痛述了日本军国主义的罪行，对日本人民的支持，表示感谢。他坚决要求日本政府赔偿他的全部损失。他欢呼祖国的强大。他兴奋的说，我走的时候，是哭着走的。回来是笑着回来的。塘沽区各界代表万英在讲话中，对刘连仁作了恳切的慰问。对刘连仁的正义斗争，表示充分支持。对岸信介政府提出严正的抗议。
    刘连仁回到祖国了！他踏上祖国土地的第一天听到的就是同胞们热烈高呼的口号：“难胞刘连仁，祖国人民在支持你！”这是刘连仁苦难的结束，他的幸福的开始。
