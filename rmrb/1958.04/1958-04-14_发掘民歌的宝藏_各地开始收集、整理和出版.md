    Unearthing the Treasure of Folk Songs
    Various Regions Begin Collecting, Organizing, and Publishing

    (Our Dispatch) Party propaganda departments and government cultural organs in various regions are earnestly collecting, organizing, and publishing the numerous folk songs that have emerged during the socialist Great Leap Forward. Some provincial and county Party committees have even issued special instructions for collecting folk songs. Zhejiang Province has mobilized many primary school teachers to "gather folk songs," while eight newspapers, periodicals, and cultural units in Jilin Province have jointly launched a campaign to solicit folk songs and folk rhymes from the province, calling on the people of the province to take action to "gather folk songs."

    A month ago, the Henan Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party instructed Party organizations in various regions to pay attention to collecting clappers, folk rhymes, and poems composed and sung by the masses during the Great Leap Forward. The Provincial Committee believes that cherishing and preserving these mass creations is equivalent to cherishing and preserving the historical data of an era. Therefore, the collection work is being carried out by the entire Party. Currently, the Henan Provincial Committee has collected more than 2,000 folk songs and clappers. Reading these poems is like seeing the surging torrent of the Great Leap Forward and hearing the revolutionary bugle call. Listen: "In the first month, the first month right, under the moonlight, carts are like dragons, delivering manure, people and horses twisted into ropes, like playing the dragon lantern during the Spring Festival. Playing the dragon lantern, twisted into ropes, catching up with the sun and catching up with the stars, the Great Leap Forward knows no day or night, this year's harvest is guaranteed." A female township head in Cheng Guan District, Dengfeng County, while building a reservoir on New Year's Eve, waved her shovel on the construction site and sang: "One lamp, one battalion of soldiers, a staff officer under the big lamp, a pioneer under the small lamp, the youth are like Zhao Yun, the old are like Huang Zhong, the children are like little Zhou Yu, the women are better than Mu Guiying." The first volume of clappers and poems created by the masses during the Great Leap Forward, compiled and selected by the Provincial Committee, has been published, with a selection of 237 songs. The second volume is currently being compiled.

    The Chinese Folk Literature Research Association is also vigorously carrying out the collection and research of folk songs. They have sent cadres to various regions to conduct investigations and collections, and have carefully selected 300 rural Great Leap Forward ballads, which will soon be compiled and published. The compilation of the industrial and mining Great Leap Forward ballads, which is currently underway, will soon be published as a book. They have also decided that in the future, collecting and researching folk songs will be a regular task. The Party propaganda departments of Hong'an County and Macheng County in Hubei Province, Shangcheng County in Henan Province, Chang'an County in Shaanxi Province, and Haiyan County in Zhejiang Province, as well as the cultural centers in many regions, have all compiled and printed the various folk songs and other oral literature created by the masses in their respective regions into small booklets, some of which have also been submitted to publishing houses for publication.

    The supplements of local newspapers and literary journals also frequently publish a large number of popular folk songs from their respective provinces and regions. For example, the "Great Leap Forward War Songs" in the supplement of Jiangxi Daily, the "Poems from the Countryside" in Jilin Daily, and the "Great Leap Forward Poetry Collection" in Shaanxi Daily, under these titles, frequently publish the creations of the farmers in their respective provinces, which have been well received by readers.

    The March issue of "People's Literature" also selected and published dozens of folk songs, clappers, and rhymes from various regions in a concentrated manner; the March issue of "Beijing Literature" published more than 50 folk songs popular in the suburbs and villages of Beijing under the title of "Beijing Great Leap Forward"; the April issue of "Yangtze River Literature" published a special issue on "Rural Great Leap Forward," publishing many creations from the province. The March issue of "Poetry Journal," with the theme of "Rural Great Leap Forward," also published many folk songs. The upcoming April issue of "Folk Literature" will also publish some articles evaluating and discussing folk songs, and criticize the "valuing the ancient and belittling the present" ideology in past folk literature work.

    发掘民歌的宝藏
    各地开始收集、整理和出版
    本报讯　各地党委宣传部门和政府文化机关，对在社会主义大跃进中出现的许多民歌，正在认真进行收集、整理和出版。有些省委、县委还特别为收集民歌发出指示。浙江省动员了许多小学教员“采风”，吉林省八个报刊和文化单位联合发起征集本省民歌、民谣，号召全省人民动手“采风”。
    一个月前，中共河南省委曾指示各地党组织，要求他们注意采集大跃进中群众自编自唱的快板、民谣和诗歌。省委认为珍视和保存这些群众创作，就等于珍视和保存一个时代的历史资料，因此采集工作是由全党来进行的。现在，河南省委已经收集到民歌、快板两千多首。阅读这些诗歌，好像看到了大跃进的汹涌澎湃的激流，听到了革命的号角。且听：“正月里，正月正，月光底下车如龙，送粪人马拧成绳，好像春节玩龙灯。玩龙灯，拧成绳，赶过太阳赶星星，跃进不分昼和夜，今年丰收有保证”。登封县城关区一位女乡长在除夕夜晚修水库时，在工地上一面挥着铁锨，一面唱道：“一盏灯，一营兵，大灯底下有参谋，小灯底下有先行，青年像赵云，老年像黄忠，儿童好似小周瑜，妇女赛过穆桂英”。省委编选的群众在大跃进中创作的快板、诗歌第一卷已经出版，共选了二百三十七首。第二卷正在编选中。
    中国民间文学研究会也大力展开民歌的汇集和研究工作。他们派出干部到各地进行调查采集，精选农村大跃进歌谣三百首，即将编印出版。在编选中的工矿大跃进歌谣，不久也可成书。他们并决定，今后把收集和研究民歌作为经常工作。湖北省红安县、麻城县，河南省商城县，陕西省长安县，浙江省海盐县的党委宣传部门和许多地区的文化馆，都把本地区群众创作的各种民歌等口头文学整理编印成小册子，有的还交给了出版社出版。
    各地方报纸的副刊和文艺刊物上，也经常大量地发表本省本地流行的民歌。如江西日报副刊的“跃进战歌”、吉林日报的“来自农村的诗”、陕西日报的“大跃进诗抄”，在这些题目下面，经常发表本省农民的创作，受到了读者的欢迎。
    今年3月号“人民文学”也选录了数十首各地的山歌、快板、顺口溜集中发表；3月号“北京文艺”以“北京大跃进”为题发表了北京郊区、乡流行的五十余首民歌；4月号“长江文艺”出版了“农村大跃进”专号，发表了不少本省创作。3月号“诗刊”以“农村大跃进”为题，也发表了许多民歌。即将出版的4月份“民间文学”还刊登一些评价和讨论民歌的文章，并对过去民间文学工作中“厚古薄今”的思想进行批判。
