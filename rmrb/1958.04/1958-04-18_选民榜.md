    Voter List
    Granny Zhang, seventy-three, is an election propagandist. She wears a red flower in her white hair, and puts on the wedding dress she wore when she got married. The gongs and drums are deafening in front, and she dances happily in the Yangko team. In the middle, the voter list is carried, with the names of the voters listed on it. When asked, "Where did you get this energy?" Granny Zhang said, "The people are in power. And we have caught up with the Great Leap Forward in production, I feel fifty years younger."

    陶钝张大娘，七十三，她是选举的宣传员。红花插在白头上，嫁时衣裳拿出来穿。前头锣鼓震天响，她在秧歌队里扭的欢。中间抬着选民榜，选举人的名字列上边。问大娘“那里来的这股劲？大娘说“人民当家有了权。又赶上生产大跃进，我觉得年青了五十年”。
