Touching Things

I want to tell you about a touching thing. Xia Chaowang, a quartermaster from a certain unit of the People's Liberation Army, rode his tricycle to Changxindian, Beijing, to buy vegetables on March 31st. Not far along the way, he saw four people, old and young, weeping by the roadside. It turned out that the old woman was taking her grandson to see her son at Dahuichang in Fengtai, but they lost their way and ended up in this desolate place with no transportation and no food. Xia Chaowang quickly invited them onto his tricycle. That day, it was windy, making it difficult to pedal, so he simply got off and pushed the cart. It took about an hour to travel more than twenty li, finally delivering the four people to their destination. However, Xia Chaowang's cotton uniform was soaked with sweat as if it had just been pulled out of the water. He didn't even have time to drink a sip of water before rushing off to complete his mission.

The next day, at dawn, Xia Chaowang received a letter from Fengtai Dahuichang, signed by Sun Jinsheng. It read: "Comrade Chaowang, thank you from the bottom of my heart for helping our lost mother, allowing our family to reunite... We will never forget your noble qualities of saving people and disregarding your own well-being... We are very uneasy that you were covered in sweat and left without even drinking water. I have no other way to express my gratitude to you except to express my determination to dedicate myself to socialism."

    使人感动的事
    我要告诉你们一件使人感动的事。解放军某部给养员夏朝旺同志，3月31日蹬着三轮板车去北京长辛店买菜。走了不远，看见路旁有老小四人在啼哭。原来这位老妇人是带着孙子到丰台大灰厂看儿子的，途中迷失了方向，走到这四不靠的地方，车雇不着，饭也吃不上，夏朝旺急忙请他们上了自己的三轮板车。那天正是迎风，蹬不动，他就干脆下来推着车走。约花一个多钟头的时间，走了二十多里路，终于把老小四人送到了目的地。可是，夏朝旺的一件棉军衣，已被汗湿得像刚从水里捞出来一样了。他连水也顾不得喝一口，就又赶去完成自己的任务。
    第二天天刚亮，夏朝旺就收到一位从丰台大灰厂寄来的署名孙进生的来信。上面写着：“朝旺同志，衷心感谢你帮助了我们的迷失路途的母亲，使我们母子团聚。……你这种救人、不顾自身的高贵品质，我们再也不会忘记。……你遍身大汗，连口水也没有喝就走，我们很是不安。我没有别的表示对你的感谢，只有向你表示我为社会主义献身努力的决心。（附图片）
