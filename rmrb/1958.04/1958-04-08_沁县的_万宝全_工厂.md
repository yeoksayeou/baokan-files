Editor's Note: The Qin County United Processing Factory has developed from an old foundation. The factory's leadership has adhered to the mass line working method and the direction of serving agriculture, solved many difficulties in funding and technology, and made remarkable achievements. Their experience can be used as a reference for other county-run factories.

Our car left Taiyuan City, heading southeast along the Bai (Gui) Jin (Cheng) Highway. Ahead, a range of mountains rose up – the Taihang Mountains.

We passed through the famous Zihongkou from the War of Resistance Against Japan, entered Laiyuan Gully, crossed the watershed, and arrived in Qin County, in the northwest of the Taihang region.

Qin County was known in the past for its tall city gates, with the saying "Xiangyuan's city, Qin County's gates." Those city gates were indeed rare in other counties in the mountainous area. But today, what attracts people to Qin County is not these historical relics, but its small-to-large, from-nothing-to-something, vibrant new local industry.

When I arrived in Qin County, I happened to encounter the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Chinese Communist Party and the Provincial People's Committee holding an "on-site conference" there, summarizing and promoting the experience of Qin County's local industry on the spot. At the same time, many provinces, including Henan, Hebei, Shaanxi, and even Heilongjiang, sent delegations to visit. The United Processing Factory, as the base point of the county's local industry, became the center of everyone's visits.

"Official Factory" Becomes "Jack-of-all-Trades"

When mentioning the Qin County United Processing Factory, farmers affectionately call it the "Jack-of-all-Trades" factory, which is enough to prove how close its relationship with the countryside is.

This factory was originally an egg factory run by the Changzhi Special District. In February 1956, after the management rights were delegated to the county, it was converted into six businesses. However, because the business philosophy was not correct, the factory was constantly declining, losing money every month, unable to buy materials or pay wages. At the end of the year, the total loss was more than 30,000 yuan, and it also owed more than 60,000 yuan in bank loans. The workers said painfully, "A year of hard work, losing 36,500 yuan!" The leading cadres were uneasy, and the general staff wanted to leave the factory. Ideologically, it was chaotic from top to bottom. Someone composed a ballad saying, "The steel mill can't get enough to eat, the electricity is unwanted, the peat has collapsed, the printing has no raw materials, the oilseed processing is little, the repairs are unreliable, it's over! Forget it! The string of money is broken!"

At that time, the factory's business and economic situation were very bad, but in management, it showed off its wealth and engaged in ostentation. The entire factory had 140 workers, with 27 full-time management cadres. Each work section could hear each other with a shout, but five telephones were installed. The factory headquarters also had a radio, microphone, and loudspeaker. At the entrance, one side was the mailroom and the other was the reception room, with two guards standing in front. On the wall hung a sign saying, "By order of higher authorities, visits are declined." When farmers saw it, they said, "This is not a factory, it is an official factory!"

Just as the Qin County United Processing Factory was getting narrower and narrower, in February 1957, the Changzhi Prefectural Committee of the Chinese Communist Party held a meeting, determining the direction of county-run local industry as: "Taking materials locally, processing them locally, doing both wholesale large jobs and scattered small jobs, facing the countryside, and actively serving the rural economy." The Qin County Party Committee further proposed the fighting goal of "going all out to support agriculture" based on this. At this time, the factory's responsible comrades began to examine their own business philosophy, organizing visits to the countryside on one hand, and launching a large debate on the relationship between workers and peasants and the direction of county-run industry in the factory on the other.

The first visit to the countryside was without the leadership of responsible cadres. Workers went to a place at random and asked the farmers, "What are your requirements for the factory? What products do you need?" The farmers replied, "You should first show us the products and then we'll talk!" The workers got a rebuff and returned. For the second visit to the countryside, the factory director led the way personally, and 37 people were divided into seven groups, making a total of four trips to the countryside, visiting 181 agricultural cooperatives. When they were in Guo Village, they saw 25 waterwheels idly placed and many new-style walking plows had become "hanging plows." They asked the farmers why. The farmers said, "This is all thanks to you worker elder brothers; you are only responsible for selling, not installing!" The visiting group heard this and immediately began to install the waterwheels and repair the parts of the new-style walking plows. The farmers said happily, "The worker elder brothers are really capable, you solved the old problem that has been piled up for more than a year with your own hands." Through such visits, the relationship between the factory and the agricultural cooperatives was established.

While they visited the countryside, they also conducted mass airing of views, free airing of views, and great debates in the factory. Some people said, "Agriculture plants its land, industry produces our products, why should we serve agriculture?" Others said, "Serving large factories and mines is glorious, with a grand scale! Industrialization has a lot of profit, and we are not afraid to leave agriculture!" Those who said this wrongly believed that processing for large industrial and mining enterprises meant bulk orders, easy management, high profits, and a bright future. Dealing with the countryside, they said, meant a small market, low purchasing power of farmers, and not much profit, saying: "Three screws and two plowshares, taking half a day's effort, you don't earn a few cents!" "Supporting farmers is like three walnuts and two jujubes, like a boil on a sparrow's leg, not much pus!" But some veteran workers, especially those who had visited the countryside, stood up to refute. Veteran machinist Chen Tingyan said: "As long as the machines turn, we are not afraid of not having food. If we turn more than twenty screws a day, we will have fifteen yuan in income. With new screws, agricultural machinery can also be started. Why don't we do this and let the machines sleep?" Veteran fitter Liu Chunshan said, "The worker-peasant alliance is definitely not just a reunion on the fifteenth day of the first month every year. If there is no agricultural production, can our factory start to process oil and grind flour? Where do our food and clothing come from?"

Through visits to the countryside and great debates, many erroneous ideas among the staff were clarified, and the correct idea of facing the countryside and serving agricultural production was established throughout the factory. At this time, the factory's Party branch put forward the slogan of "using industry to support industry, using groups to support groups, and using people to support people." Through the "four investigations" of investigating production loopholes, investigating management loopholes, investigating waste, and investigating accidents, as well as the method of issuing topics and offering rewards for trial production of new products such as corn cob crushers and rice milling machines, a "campaign to offer hundreds of plans" was launched among the staff. As a result, from April to June, the staff put forward a total of 137 rationalization proposals, and many problems that had been unresolved for a long time were readily solved. The number of factory management personnel was reduced from 27 to 13. The factory director and the Party branch secretary divided up areas of responsibility. The chairman of the trade union and the secretary of the Communist Youth League were both part-time. The number of telephones was reduced to one. The gate guards were removed. The sign "No Visits Allowed" was taken down. Their new slogan was: "Repair on arrival, available on call." Whether it was after work or on holidays, as long as the countryside had work to deliver or asked for repairs, they were "responsive to every request."

With the right path, the business of the Qin County United Processing Factory developed by leaps and bounds. In the year of 1957, they had already realized the county committee's instruction of "using the factory to support the factory and being self-sufficient" and had a surplus. The staff became more and more motivated. They were always thinking about how to adapt to the needs of the great development of agricultural production. In the past year, the factory's products had increased from the original 13 to more than 50, from small "local screws" to "local steel mills" and "local corn cob crushers" for processing grain and feed for farmers, all the way to "local levels," "local drilling machines," and "local floodgates" for water conservancy construction. It really had everything farmers wanted, and it was very popular with farmers, so the farmers gave it the name "Jack-of-all-Trades" factory.

Technical Support Team

To make a great leap forward in agricultural production, many basic construction projects need to be carried out, and the most arduous task is water conservancy construction. These many projects require technical support. Therefore, the Qin County United Processing Factory organized a "Technical Support Team" to support rural water conservancy construction and other basic construction work.

The Technical Support Team was composed of 13 people, including veteran worker Liu Chunshan. The first task they received was to support the construction project of the "Yingchun Reservoir." This reservoir covers an area of ​​1,000 mu, stores 3.3 million cubic meters of water, and has a canal length of 20 li. It was the first large reservoir built in Qin County in history. With no experience and nothing, the "Technical Support Team" faced many difficulties, but they overcame them one by one.

At the beginning, it was necessary to measure and drill to select the reservoir site and conduct technical design. But there were no tools. The workers of the Technical Support Team trial-produced a simple level and a hand-cranked geological drilling machine, which were very popular when sent to the construction site. After the difficulties of surveying and drilling were solved, they encountered the problem of water accumulating in the dam foundation that could not be drained. The Technical Support Team sent four workers to drain the water day and night with machines, so that the construction of the dam could proceed smoothly. Later, the Technical Support Team also trial-produced a three-ton stone roller with ball bearings and sent workers to the construction site to install electric lights to ensure that the reservoir construction project was completed ahead of schedule before the rainy season. Throughout the entire process, the Technical Support Team established a special research group to trial-produce equipment for controlling and regulating water volume. They sent veteran worker Chen Tingyan to visit the "Happiness Reservoir" in Changzhi, drew a picture to imitate it, and returned to work many times. Finally, in late June, they made a complete set of mechanical equipment for controlling and regulating water volume, including a four-ton gate lifting machine, a high-pressure floodgate, a sand flushing gate, a standby gate, and a fish barrier net.

With the development of rural construction, the role of the "Technical Support Team" is becoming more and more important. The small hydropower station jointly run by the Houquan Agricultural Cooperative and the County Supply and Marketing Cooperative, and the small thermal power station jointly run by the Guxian Agricultural Cooperative and the Handicraft Cooperative, were all built with the help of the support team. The complete set of equipment for the Houquan Hydropower Station, including the water turbine, water turbine governor, headstock, ground shaft, and gate lifting machine, was also manufactured with their help. In addition, electrical workers were sent to cultivate technical talents for these two rural power stations.

Now, this rural technical assault force is active on the construction site of the largest reservoir being built in the county – the Geluhe Reservoir.

Mobile Repair Group

In addition to supporting major construction projects in rural areas, the Qin County United Processing Factory also established a "Mobile Repair Group" that frequently goes to the countryside and mountains to help agricultural cooperatives and farmers repair various agricultural implements, large and small.

The Mobile Repair Group is composed of six workers. From April to November 1957, they went to the countryside a total of 130 times, repairing 1,800 pieces of various agricultural machinery and parts. During the drought, team leader Chen Tingyan and apprentice Zhang Yunhai rode their bicycles and constantly helped the agricultural cooperatives repair agricultural tools, covering more than 700 li in seven days, making the relationship between workers and farmers deeper and deeper.

One day, veteran worker Chen Tingyan had just repaired a boiler engine in Guyi Village when he received a call saying that the boiler engine in Rensheng Village was broken. He immediately rode his bicycle to rush there. At this time, some members of the agricultural cooperative sarcastically said: "Operating the machine is not as fast as people working! That's not a boiler engine, it's a gas stomach engine, it's useless to repair it!" Old Chen heard it without saying a word, thinking secretly in his heart: "I must repair this machine. Otherwise, where should we workers put our faces!" He didn't bother to eat, and repaired it for two full hours, but it still wouldn't start. Old Chen carefully checked all the parts again, and finally repaired the machine at more than one o'clock in the middle of the night. The farmers were very moved.

Now, with the development of agricultural production, the number of new agricultural implements and agricultural machinery in rural areas is constantly increasing. It is not enough to rely on the several workers of the repair team to repair them. It is necessary to cultivate a group of technical talents in rural areas. This burden has fallen on the "Mobile Repair Group." Veteran worker Chen Tingyan and young worker Fan Xiaohong now have their own apprentices in rural areas. They adopt the method of "the hen lays eggs" and sign master-apprentice contracts according to the principle of voluntary combination. Both parties guarantee that within half a year or a year, they will teach and learn the repair technology of one or several kinds of agricultural machinery and new agricultural implements. This kind of master-apprentice contract has now developed to more than 80 copies. (Attached picture)

    沁县的“万宝全”工厂
    本报记者　　展潮
    编者按：沁县联合加工厂是在旧的基础上发展起来的。这个厂的领导方面坚持执行群众路线的工作方法和为农业服务的方向，解决了资金和技术上的许多困难，做出了显著的成绩。他们的经验可供其他县营工厂参考。
    汽车离开了太原市，沿着白（圭）晋（城）公路直奔东南，前面耸立着一溜山脉，那便是太行山了。
    我们通过抗日战争时著名的子洪口，进入来远沟，翻越分水岭，便来到了太行区西北部的沁县。
    沁县过去以城门高大著称，有所谓“襄垣的城，沁县的门”的说法，那城门确实是山区其他县份所少有的。但是今天沁县吸引人的却不是这些历史的遗迹，而是它由小到大、由无到有、朝气蓬勃的新型地方工业。
    当我到达沁县的时候，碰巧遇上中共山西省委会和省人民委员会在那里召开“现场会议”，就地总结、推广沁县地方工业的经验；同时，河南、河北、陕西乃至黑龙江等许多省份都派了代表团，络绎不绝地前来参观访问。作为县地方工业基点的联合加工厂，便成为大家参观访问的中心了。“官厂”变成“万宝全”
    提起沁县联合加工厂，农民都亲热地叫作“万宝全”工厂，足以证明它和农村的关系是多么密切了。
    这个工厂原是长治专署经营的一个蛋厂。1956年2月管理权下放到县后，改成六种业务，但是因为经营思想不对头，工厂一直在走下坡路，闹得月月赔钱，买不上材料、发不了工资，年终结账总共亏损三万多元，另外还欠银行贷款六万多元。工人们痛心地说：“一年辛勤苦，赔钱三万六千五！”领导干部不安心，一般职工想跳厂，自上到下思想都很混乱，有人编了一首歌谣说：“钢磨吃不饱，电力没人要，泥炭垮台了，印刷没原料，油籽加工少，修理不可靠，完了！算了！钱串断了！”
    当时工厂的业务和经济情况都很糟，但是在管理上却耍阔气、讲排场。全厂一百四十个工人，就有二十七个专职管理干部；各工段之间吆喝一声就可以听见了，却安了五部电话机，厂部里还有收音机、麦克风和大喇叭筒，大门口一边是收发室、一边是传达室，门前站着两个门警，墙上挂着一块“奉上级命令谢绝参观”的牌子。农民见了说：“这不是工厂，是官厂！”
    正当沁县联合加工厂路越走越窄的时候，1957年2月，中共长治地委召开会议，确定县营地方工业的方针是：“就地取材，就地加工，既作整批大活，又作零星小活，面向农村，积极为农村经济服务”。沁县县委再根据这提出了“全力以赴，支援农业”的奋斗目标。这时，工厂的负责同志开始检查自己的经营思想，一方面组织下乡访问，一方面在厂里以工农关系和县营工业方向为题展开大辩论。
    第一次下乡访问，没有负责干部带领，工人随便走到一个地方问农民说：“你们对工厂有什么要求？需要什么产品？”农民回答说：“你们先把产品拿出来看看再说！”工人碰了个钉子回去了。第二次下乡访问，厂长亲自带领，三十七个人分成七个小组，总共下了四趟乡，访问了一百八十一个农业社。当他们在郭村的时候，看见了二十五部水车闲搁着、许多新式步犁变成了“挂犁”，问农民是什么原因。农民说：“这都是你们工人老大哥干的好事，管卖不管安装！”访问组听了，马上动手把水车安上，把新式步犁的零件修理好。农民们高兴的说：“工人老大哥就是行，你们动手就解决了积压一年多的老问题。”经过这样的访问，工厂和农业社的关系建立起来了。
    他们一面访问农村，一面在工厂里进行群众性的大鸣、大放、大辩论。有人说：“农业种他的地，工业生咱的产，为啥要为农业服务？”又说：“为大厂矿服务光荣，气魄大！工业化油水大，离开农业也不怕！”说这种话的人，错误地认为给大工矿企业加工，活成批，好经营，赚钱多，前途大；和农村打交道，市场狭小，农民购买力低，油水不大，说什么：“三个螺丝钉、两个犁铧片，费上半天劲，赚不下几毛钱！”“支援农民是三个核桃两颗枣，好比麻雀腿上生连疮，没有多大脓水！”但是一些老工人，特别是下乡访问过的工人，纷纷起来反驳。老机工陈廷彦说：“只要机器转，不怕没饭吃，一天镟上二十多个螺丝，就会有十五块钱收入，换了新螺丝，农业机械也能开动了，为什么我们不这样做、却让机器睡大觉呢？”老钳工刘纯山说：“工农联盟绝不是每年正月十五联欢一次就够了，要是没有农业生产，咱们工厂能开工榨油、磨面吗？咱们吃穿从哪里来？”
    经过下乡访问和大辩论，澄清了职工中许多错误的想法，在全厂范围内树立起面向农村、为农业生产服务的正确思想。这时候，工厂党支部提出了“以业养业，以组养组，以人养人”的口号，通过查生产漏洞、查管理漏洞、查浪费、查事故的“四查”，以及出题悬赏试制玉米轴粉碎机、碾米机等新产品的办法，在职工群众中展开了“献百计运动”。结果从4月到6月，职工们总共提出了一百三十七条合理化建议，许多过去长期解决不了的问题都迎刃而解了。工厂管理人员由二十七人减到十三人，厂长和党支部书记分片包干，工会主席和团支部书记都是兼职的，电话减成一部，门警撤销了，“谢绝参观”的牌子摘掉了，他们新的口号是：“随到随修，随叫随到。”不论是下班或是假日，只要农村有活送上门来或者请去修理，都是“有求必应”。
    路走对了，沁县联合加工厂的业务就飞跃地发展起来了，在1957年一年内，他们已经实现了县委“以厂养厂、自给自足”的指示，并且有了盈余。职工们干劲越来越大。他们时刻都在考虑怎样适应农业生产大发展的需要。去年一年里，工厂的产品就由原来的十三种增加到五十多种，从小的“土螺丝”起，到农户粮食和饲料加工用的“土钢磨”、“土玉米轴粉碎机”，一直到水利建设用的“土水平仪”、“土钻探机”、“土闸门”等等，真是要啥有啥，很受农民欢迎，因此农民给它起了个名字，叫作“万宝全”工厂。
          技术支援队
    农业生产要大跃进，就需要进行许多基本建设，其中最繁重的任务是水利建设，这许多工程都需要技术力量支援，于是沁县联合加工厂便组织了一支“技术支援队”，支援农村水利建设和其他基本建设工作。
    技术支援队由老工人刘纯山等十三个人组成。他们接受的第一个任务就是支援“迎春水库”的建设工程。这个水库方圆一千亩，蓄水三百三十万立方，渠长二十里，是沁县有史以来第一次修建的大水库，要经验没有经验，要东西没有东西，摆在“技术支援队”面前是重重的困难，但是他们都一个一个地克服了。
    开始，因为要选择水库库址和进行技术设计，就需要测量、钻探。但是没有工具。技术支援队的工人们便试制了一架简易水平仪、一部手摇地层钻，送到工地上大受欢迎。测量、钻探的困难解决了，又碰到坝基积水排不出去。技术支援队派了四位工人去，用机器昼夜排水，使水坝建设工程能够顺利地进行。后来，技术支援队又试制了一个带滚珠的三吨重的大石滚，派工人到工地上安装电灯，保证水库建设工程提早在雨季前全部完成。在整个过程中，技术支援队成立了一个专门研究试制控制和调节水量器械的小组，派老工人陈廷彦到长治“幸福水库”去参观，画了一张图回来仿造，返了好多次工，终于在6月下旬做成了四吨重的起闸机、高压水闸、冲沙闸、预备闸和拦鱼网等全套控制和调节水量的机械设备。
    随着农村建设的发展，“技术支援队”的作用是愈来愈大了。后泉农业社和县供销社合办的小型水力发电站，故县农业社和手工业社合办的小型火力发电站，都是在支援队的帮助下建设起来的。后泉水力发电站的水轮机、水轮调速器、天轴、地轴、起闸机等整套设备，也是他们帮助制造的。此外，还派了电机工人去给这两个农村电站培养技术人才。
    现在，这支农村的技术突击力量，正活跃在全县新建的一个最大的水库——圪芦河水库的工地上。
          流动检修组
    除了支援农村重大的建设工程外，沁县联合加工厂还成立了一个“流动检修组”，经常下乡上山，帮助农业社和农民修理各种大小农具。
    流动检修组是由六个工人组成的。他们从1957年4月到11月，总共下乡一百三十次，修理好各种农业机械、零件等一千八百件。天旱的时候，组长陈廷彦跟徒弟张云孩两人骑上自行车，不停地帮助农业社修理农具，在七天里跑了七百多里地，使工人和农民的关系愈来愈深厚了。
    一天，老工人陈廷彦刚把固亦村的一部锅驼机修理好，又接到电话说任胜村的锅驼机坏了，他马上骑着车子赶去。这时候农业社有些社员冷言冷语地说：“开机器还不如人干得快呐！那不是锅驼机，是气肚机，修了也白搭！”老陈听见了也不作声，心里暗暗地想：“我非要把这部机器修好不可。要不，咱这工人的脸往哪儿搁！”他饭也顾不得吃，整整修理了两个钟头，还是开不动；老陈又仔细检查所有的部件，终于在深夜一点多钟把机器修理好了，农民都很感动。
    现在，随着农业生产的发展，农村里的新式农具和农业机械不断地增加，光靠检修组的几个工人去检修是不行了，必须在农村里培养一批技术人才。这个担子便落在了“流动检修组”的身上。老工人陈廷彦、青年工人樊小红现在在农村里都有了自己的徒弟，他们采取“母鸡下蛋”的办法，按照自愿结合的原则签订了师徒合同，双方保证在半年或者一年内，教会、学好一种或几种农业机械和新式农具的检修技术。这种师徒合同，现在已经发展到八十多份。（附图片）
