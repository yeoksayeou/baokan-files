    4,000 Yuan Trucks
    A simple and lightweight "Hongyan" brand small truck, suitable for agricultural production and with a low price, was successfully trial-produced on the afternoon of the 14th at the Chongqing Automobile Parts Manufacturing Factory.

    This car has twenty-four horsepower, can carry one to one and a half tons, can travel forty kilometers per hour, and also has low fuel consumption. It is estimated that the price of each vehicle is around 4,000 yuan, which most agricultural cooperatives can afford. In addition to transportation, the "Hongyan" brand small truck can also be used for pumping water and threshing if some auxiliary devices are added, using the engine as power. At the same time, with slight modifications, it can use fuels such as natural gas, white coal, and charcoal.

    四千元一辆货车
    一种适合农业生产使用的、价格较低的简便、轻易的“红岩”牌小货车，14日下午在重庆汽车配件制造厂试制成功。
    这种汽车有二十四马力，可以载重一吨到一吨半，每小时可行驶四十公里，用油量也低。估计每辆车售价在四千元左右，一般农业社都可以买得起。“红岩”牌小货车除作运输外，只要加些附属装置，以引擎作动力，还可用来抽水、打谷。同时将它稍加改装就可用天然气、白煤和木炭等作燃料。
