The Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China is taking measures to vigorously strengthen the construction of a Marxist theoretical team.

In January, the Shanxi Provincial Committee issued instructions on strengthening the training of theoretical workers. The instructions required that, starting this year, during the Second Five-Year Plan period or for a longer period, a group of theoretical workers be cultivated who have systematically studied Marxist-Leninist classics (especially the works of Comrade Mao Zedong), have a certain amount of practical work experience, possess excellent political qualities, have healthy ideological consciousness, and whose theory is consistent with practice; it requires that each county train at least two to four people, each prefectural and municipal party committee train five to ten people, and provincial-level agencies train thirty to forty people. In order to achieve the above requirements, the instructions stipulate that a total of 415 on-the-job cadre theory instructors should be set up in provincial, prefectural, municipal, and county-level agencies. In factories and mining enterprises, one, two, or three full-time theory instructors should be set up for every 500, 1,000, or 1,500 cadres. The "Shanxi Daily" editorial department and the "Spark" magazine editorial department of the Federation of Literary and Art Circles should each set up three to five literary and art theory cadres. The instructions put forward the conditions for selecting theory instructors, and emphasized the need to equip a certain number of key personnel. The instructions also emphasized that, in addition to organizing theory instructors to conscientiously study Marxist-Leninist classics, they must also be organized to spend one-third of their time each year going to rural areas or factories, going deep into the masses, learning from the masses, and participating in physical labor, so as to cultivate and train them as soon as possible into theoretical workers whose theory is consistent with practice.

Recently, at an enlarged meeting of the Shanxi Provincial Committee of the Communist Party of China, the issue of building a theoretical work team was further discussed. In addition to requiring areas that have not yet fully staffed their theory instructors to quickly complete the staffing, the Provincial Committee decided to immediately organize a part-time theoretical research team from the province's leading cadres. From the secretary of the Provincial Committee to the secretaries and deputy secretaries of the prefectural and municipal party committees, from the governor to the directors and deputy directors of the government departments and bureaus, as well as middle-level leading cadres, all those who are qualified should be organized into this team. The task of this team is to strengthen the study and publicity of Marxist-Leninist theory, enliven the atmosphere of theoretical research, and study and explain the theoretical problems encountered in practical work.

At present, the local, municipal, and county party committees are actively adjusting and equipping on-the-job cadre theory instructors in accordance with the instructions of the Provincial Committee. The Xin County, Yanbei, and Jinnan Prefectural Committees and the Yangquan and Changzhi Municipal Committees have basically completed this work. Xin County Prefecture has a total of 48 authorized on-the-job cadre theory instructors, and 43 people had been assigned by early March.

The recently held enlarged meeting of the Provincial Committee also decided to quickly establish a province-wide theoretical publication. This publication will be led by the Provincial Committee, with the First Secretary in command and the Propaganda Department in charge. The task of the publication is to discuss and study theoretical issues raised in the province's practical work; to help cadres study theory; to discuss theoretical issues raised throughout the country as needed and as possible; and to actively participate in the criticism of bourgeois academic viewpoints.

    山西省委决定培养理论干部和创办理论刊物
    加强马克思主义的理论队伍
    本报太原讯　中共山西省委员会正采取措施，大力加强马克思主义理论队伍的建设工作。
    山西省委在一月间发出了关于加强培养理论工作队伍的指示。指示中要求从今年起，在第二个五年计划期间或者更多一些的时间内，培养出一批系统地学习过马克思列宁主义经典著作（特别是毛泽东同志的著作），具有一定的实际工作经验，政治品质优良，思想意识健康，理论与实际相一致的理论工作干部；要求每个县至少培养出二人至四人，每个地、市委培养出五人至十人，省直机关培养出三十人至四十人。为了实现上述要求，指示中规定省、地、市、县级机关共设置在职干部理论教员四百一十五名。在厂矿企业中，凡是干部在五百名、一千名、一千五百名左右的，各设专职理论教员一名、二名或三名。“山西日报”编辑部、文联的“火花”杂志编辑部各设文艺理论干部三名至五名。指示中提出了挑选理论教员的条件，并强调要配备一定数量的骨干。指示中还着重提出，除了组织理论教员认真地学习马克思列宁主义经典著作以外，还必须组织他们每年以三分之一的时间，到农村或工厂，深入群众，向群众学习，并且参加体力劳动，尽快地把他们培养和锻炼成为理论与实际相一致的理论工作干部。
    最近，在中共山西省委召开的省委扩大会议上，进一步讨论了建设理论工作队伍的问题。省委除了要求尚未配齐理论教员的地区，迅速配备齐全以外，并决定立即从全省的领导干部中，组织一支兼职的理论研究队伍。从省委书记到地、市委正、副书记，从省长到政府厅、局长，以及中层领导干部中，凡是有条件的，都要组织进这支队伍中来。这支队伍的任务是，加强马克思列宁主义理论的学习和宣传工作，活跃理论研究空气；研究和说明实际工作中遇到的理论性的问题。
    目前各地、市、县委正在根据省委的指示，积极地调整和配备在职干部理论教员。忻县、雁北、晋南地委和阳泉、长治市委，已经基本上完成了这一工作。忻县地区在职干部理论教员编制名额共为四十八人，到3月上旬已配备起四十三人。
    最近召开的省委扩大会议上，还决定迅速创办一个全省性的理论刊物。这个刊物由省委领导，第一书记挂帅，宣传部承办。刊物的任务是：讨论和研究全省实际工作中提出的带有理论性的问题；帮助干部学习理论；根据需要和可能讨论全国各地提出的理论性的问题；并积极参加对资产阶级学术观点的批判。
