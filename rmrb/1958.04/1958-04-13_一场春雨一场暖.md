    One Spring Rain Brings Warmth
    Hu Dingsu
    “One spring rain brings warmth, one autumn rain brings cold.” These two climate sayings are very much in line with scientific principles.

    Why does it get warmer after a spring rain? This is because after the beginning of spring, the maritime air mass from the southeast sea gradually moves northward. The sea temperature in the south is relatively high, and the humidity is also high, containing a lot of heat. During the northward advancement, the temperature of the warm air current gradually decreases, and finally the moisture in the air reaches saturation and falls as raindrops. Therefore, the spring rainy season in China also begins gradually from South China to North China. With the arrival of spring rain, it also indicates the arrival of warm air currents from the southeast sea. Of course, the increase in temperature is not only due to the arrival of warm air currents, but also due to solar radiation. In spring, the amount of solar radiation in the northern hemisphere gradually increases, and the temperature increases accordingly. China is located in the temperate continental zone of the northern hemisphere, and the radiation provided by the sun is also increasing day by day. This is the main heat source for warming after spring rain.

    One autumn rain brings cold. This is because after the autumnal equinox, the sun turns from the Tropic of Cancer to the southern hemisphere, and the amount of solar radiation received by the northern hemisphere decreases day by day. On the contrary, the heat radiated from the ground to the sky increases because of the "high autumn sky and refreshing air" and less cloud cover. At this time, cold air currents from the northern continent also move south frequently, and the weather gradually turns cold. After the rain, the moisture near the surface of the ground increases. This moisture constantly absorbs heat and evaporates, so a lot of heat is lost in the air, and the temperature drops even more.

    一场春雨一场暖
    胡定苏
    “一场春雨一场暖，一场秋雨一场寒”，这两句气候谚语，是很合乎科学道理的。
    为什么春雨后会增暖呢？这是因为春天开始以后，东南海面上的海洋气团逐渐向北推进。南方海洋气温较高，湿度也大，蕴藏的热量多。在向北推进过程中，暖气流的温度逐渐降低，最后空气中的水分达到饱和而呈雨点下降，因此中国春天雨季开始也是由华南逐步向华北渐进的。随着春雨的降临，也表示东南海面上暖气流的来到。当然，气温的增高，不仅是因为暖气流的到来，还由于太阳照射。春天，北半球的太阳照射量逐渐增多，气温随着增加。我国地处北半球温带大陆，太阳所给予的辐射也一天一天增多，这是春雨后增暖的主要热源。
    一场秋雨一场寒，这是由于秋分以后太阳由北回归线转向南半球，北半球所获得太阳辐射的热量已一天一天地减少，而地面向天空辐射的热量，反倒因为“秋高气爽”云量较少而增加。这时候北方大陆的冷气流也频频南下，天气逐渐转寒。下雨以后，地面表层附近水分增多。这些水分又不断吸收热量而蒸发，因此空气中又要丧失许多热量，而气温更加降低。
