Xinhua News Agency Report: The broad masses of working people urgently demand planned birth control to improve the health of parents and children and increase labor productivity. This was the unanimous conclusion reached by maternal and child health workers from all over the country when they reported on family planning work to the Ministry of Health from March 28th to April 2nd.

According to reports from various provinces, cities, and autonomous regions (excluding Xinjiang and Tibet), China's population birth rate has increased compared to the 1953 census due to rapid economic development and improved living standards. At the same time, due to the progress of health work, especially maternal and child care, and the promotion of modern midwifery, infant mortality rates have been greatly reduced. Many women are also urgently requesting birth control. Family planning work has already begun in many areas under the leadership of local Party and government. In some areas where the work has been particularly well done, such as Hejian County in Hebei Province, Dengfeng County in Henan Province, Nanchong County in Sichuan Province, and Wendeng County in Shandong Province, the benefits of planned birth control and methods of contraception are already known to every household.

Qi Zhonghuan, Assistant Minister of Health, said at the meeting that these facts show that birth control is urgently needed by the broad masses of people across the country. As long as Party and government leaders at all levels attach importance to it, do a good job in publicity, eliminate the feudal superstitions and fatalistic views of the masses, and do a good job in technical guidance and the supply of contraceptives, planned parenthood can be universally promoted throughout the country, except in ethnic minority areas and sparsely populated Han areas.

Qi Zhonghuan said that according to the reports from various places, the main obstacles to promoting birth control at present are, first, that leaders in some areas lack understanding of the important significance of this work and the benefits of birth control for families and the country, or do not believe that birth control can be universally promoted, and therefore have not put it on the agenda. At the same time, many people, including cadres, although they have the need for contraception and birth control, believe that this kind of thing between men and women "cannot be brought to the table," so they dare not talk about contraception and birth control, dare not learn the technology, and dare not buy and use devices. This situation must be reversed in the future. He also said that while doing a good job in birth control, it is also necessary to do a good job in the health care of pregnant women and infants.

### 促进生产　增进健康  计划生育人人说好

    促进生产　增进健康
    计划生育人人说好
    新华社讯　广大劳动人民迫切要求有计划地节制生育，以增进父母子女健康，提高劳动生产能力。这是全国各地妇幼卫生工作者3月28日到4月2日向卫生部汇报节育工作时一致得出的认识。
    从各省、市、自治区（除新疆、西藏）的汇报看来，我国人民由于经济的迅速发展和生活的改善，人口出生率较1953年普查时已有增长；同时由于卫生工作、特别是妇幼保健工作的进步，新法接生的推行，使婴儿死亡率大大降低，许多妇女，也迫切要求进行节育。现在许多地区的节育工作已经在当地党政领导下开展起来，在有些做得特别好的地区，例如河北省的河间县、河南省的登封县、四川省的南充县、山东省的文登县等，有计划地节制生育的好处和节育方法，已经家喻户晓。
    卫生部部长助理齐仲桓在会上说，这些事实说明节育是全国广大人民迫切需要的，只要各地党政领导重视，做好宣传工作，破除群众的封建迷信思想和宿命观点，以及做好技术指导工作和避孕器具的供应工作，除少数民族地区和人口稀少的汉族地区不推行节育外，全国各地普遍推行计划生育的工作是可以做好的。
    齐仲桓说，从各地汇报的情况看来，目前推行节育的主要障碍，首先是有些地区的领导干部对这个工作的重要意义、节育对家庭对国家的好处缺乏认识，或者不相信节育可以普遍推广，因而还没有把它放到议事日程上来。同时，许多群众，包括干部，虽然有避孕节育的要求，但是认为这种男女之间的事是“不能登大雅之堂”的，因此他们不敢谈避孕节育，不敢学技术，不敢买用器；这种情况，今后必须扭转。他还说，在做好节育工作的同时，还要作好孕产妇的保健和婴幼儿的保健工作。
