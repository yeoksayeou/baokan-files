It is good that everyone is responding to the Party's call to reform writing style and make their language more vivid. To be more vivid, it is acceptable to use idioms and proverbs. However, when using idioms and proverbs, we must first understand their meaning and not use them indiscriminately.

Recently, I saw a documentary about anti-waste, and one of the explanatory sentences (paraphrased) was: The masses have launched a high tide of anti-waste movement, and the working class is "shou dang qi chong" (bears the brunt)… Judging from the content of the film, the original intention of this sentence was to indicate that the working class is the leader of the movement. However, because the idiom "shou dang qi chong" contains the meaning of being in a passive position, this explanatory sentence becomes: the target of the movement is the working class, and the working class is the leader of waste. The meaning is obviously wrong.

Another example is "qing zhu nan shu" (impossible to record all with bamboo scripts). This idiom also has a certain meaning, referring to the fact that bad people have done so many bad things that even if all the bamboo on the South Mountain were made into paper, they still could not be written down completely. However, some articles and news reports use this idiom to describe how many good deeds good people have done, which is laughable. (Chun)

    “首当其冲”之类
    大家响应党的号召要改革文风，使自己的语言生动一些，这是好的。为了要生动，采用一些成语谚语，也是可以的。但是，我们在运用成语谚语的时候，先要弄清楚它的含意，不能随便乱用。
    最近看到一部关于反浪费的纪录片，解释词中有这样一句话（大意）：群众掀起了反浪费运动的高涨，首当其冲的是工人阶级……。联系影片内容来看，这句话的原意是指运动的带头者是工人阶级。可是由于“首当其冲”这个成语包含着处于被动地位的意思，就使这句解释词变成了这样：运动的对象是工人阶级，工人阶级是浪费的带头者。意思显然不对了。
    又如“罄竹难书”，这句成语也有一定的含意，它指的是坏人的坏事多，多得即使把南山上所有的竹子做成纸，也还是写不完。可是有的文章、新闻里却用这句成语来形容好人的好事多，那就使人啼笑皆非了。　（春）
