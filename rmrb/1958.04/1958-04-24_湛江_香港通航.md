Xinhua News Agency, Guangzhou, April 23rd: Cargo ships have begun operating between Zhanjiang and Hong Kong since mid-April. Ships on this route will sail five times a month. After the route opens, goods exported from Zhanjiang and Guangxi will no longer need to be transshipped through Guangzhou to Hong Kong. This will greatly reduce cargo damage and save on transportation costs.

    湛江—香港通航
    新华社广州23日电　湛江—香港间已从4月中旬起开行货轮。这条航线的海轮，每月航行五次，通航以后，湛江、广西一带出口的物资再不用经广州转运香港。这样，就可以大大降低货运损耗率，节约运输成本。
