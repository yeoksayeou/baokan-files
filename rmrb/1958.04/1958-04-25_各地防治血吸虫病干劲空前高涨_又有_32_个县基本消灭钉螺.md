Xinhua News Agency, Shanghai, April 24th: Tens of millions of people in schistosomiasis-endemic areas across the country have joined the spring prevention and control campaign. In Anhui Province, 30%–40% of the total labor force in the entire epidemic area was mobilized to participate in the campaign. In Kunshan County, Jiangsu Province, out of a total labor force of 150,000, as many as 120,000 people participated in the prevention and control campaign. People in epidemic areas of various provinces and cities have formed countless shock brigades to fight schistosomiasis.

By the end of March, according to incomplete statistics, the area where snails have been eliminated nationwide has reached 1 billion square meters, and 32 new counties and cities have basically eliminated snails. These counties and cities are: Yiyang City, Yiyang, Changde, Shimen, Linli, Wangcheng counties in Hunan Province; Dangyang, Yuan'an, Xishui, Xianning counties in Hubei Province; Nan'an, Tongan, Xianyou, Pingtan, Haicheng counties in Fujian Province; Jiangyin, Nanhui, Taicang, Zhenze counties in Jiangsu Province; Nanhai, Zengcheng, Wengyuan counties in Guangdong Province; Huanjiang, Hechi, Donglan counties in Guangxi; Wuhu, Taihu, Fanchang, Shidai, Qianshan, Yi County in Anhui Province; Gejiu City in Yunnan Province. The number of people treated for schistosomiasis across the country has reached more than 355,000. This number exceeds half of the total number of schistosomiasis patients treated throughout last year.

This spring's prevention and control campaign was launched on the basis of implementing the spirit of the Fourth National Schistosomiasis Prevention and Control Work Conference. The slogan put forward by the Fourth Conference, "Go all out, make an all-round leap forward, fight hard for three years, and accelerate the elimination of schistosomiasis," has resounded throughout the epidemic areas. Everywhere, the secretaries took the lead, commanding and fighting at the same time. The five secretaries of the Xuan County Party Committee in Anhui Province all went out to take charge of their respective areas. Under the leadership's lead, everyone was brave and competed to be the first. Wuhu County achieved basic snail-free status in just eighteen days. Fuliang County, Jiangxi Province, also eliminated schistosomiasis in ten days. The three-day treatment method has been widely promoted in various places. In Qingren Township, Lushan County, Sichuan Province, a treatment team composed of doctors Xu Guangjun and others treated 467 patients in one month. During the same period last year, using the twenty-day treatment method, a medical worker could only treat fifteen patients. Some leading departments in some areas used to emphasize that they were mountainous or lake areas, and that they did not have senior doctors, etc., and believed that "other places have good conditions, and we have poor conditions." The actual actions and achievements made have begun to break through this backward "condition" theory.

In the first three months of this year, various provinces and cities also accumulated a lot of experience in prevention and control work. In Jiading County, Shanghai, in the mass movement to comprehensively eliminate snails, the quality of snail elimination was very high because propaganda manuals were distributed first to explain the technical standards, and a verification system was established for the masses to check and compare themselves. All 1,300 rivers and ditches in the county were drained by the masses before snail elimination. Now the masses have also elected backbones to serve as mass technical instructors for the prevention and control movement; and also proposed the "five determinations" method of fixing people, fixing time, fixing quality, fixing quantity, and fixing work points. In terms of fecal management, many areas have paid attention to combining propaganda with the masses' own interests to enlighten the masses' awareness, combine it with fertilizer accumulation, and establish a special person responsible system. In Changde Prefecture, Hunan Province, 50% of the ships have completed fecal management, and the remaining ships are also installing toilet buckets and manure tanks.

At present, various places have entered the spring plowing season. Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Jiangsu and other provinces are conducting inspections of schistosomiasis prevention and control work in conjunction with major production inspections. Areas that have basically eliminated schistosomiasis will be subject to in-depth re-examination, and efforts will be made to completely eliminate schistosomiasis. (Attached picture)

    各地防治血吸虫病干劲空前高涨
    又有32个县基本消灭钉螺
    据新华社上海24日电　全国血吸虫病流行区有几千万人民投入今春的防治运动。安徽省发动了整个流行地区的30％—40％的劳动力投入了运动。江苏省昆山县全县共有劳动力十五万人，参加防治运动的竟达到十二万人。各省市疫区的人民组成了无数的防治血吸虫病的突击队，参加斗争。
    到3月底止，据不完全的统计，全国各地消灭钉螺的面积已达到十亿平方公尺，又新出现了三十二个基本无螺县市。这些县市是：湖南省的益阳市、益阳、常德、石门、临澧、望城等县，湖北省的当阳、远安、浠水、咸宁等县，福建省的南安、同安、仙游、平潭、海澄等县，江苏省的江阴、南汇、太仓、震泽等县，广东省的南海、增城、翁源等县，广西的环江、河池、东兰等县，安徽省的芜湖、太湖、繁昌、石埭、潜山、黟县等县，云南省的个旧市。各地治疗血吸虫病的人数达到三十五万五千多人。这个数字超过了去年全年治疗血吸虫病的病人总数的一半。
    今春的防治运动是在贯彻第四次全国防治血吸虫病工作会议精神的基础上开展的。第四次会议提出的口号：“鼓足干劲，全面跃进，苦战三年，加速消灭血吸虫病”，已经响遍了流行区。各地都由书记挂帅，一面指挥，一面战斗。安徽省宣城县县委书记处的五位书记一齐出动，分头包干。在领导带头下，人人奋勇，个个争先。芜湖县只用十八天时间，就做到了基本无螺县。江西省浮梁县也在十天内消灭了血吸虫病。三日疗法已经在各地普遍推广。四川省芦山县青仁乡由医生徐光俊等三人组成的治疗小组，一个月收治了四百六十七名病人。去年这个时期用二十天疗法，一个医疗人员只能收治十五名病人。有些地区的领导部门过去强调自己是山区或湖沼地区、没有高级的医师等等，认为“别处条件好，自己条件差”，现在的实际行动和所得的成绩，已开始冲破这种落后的“条件”论。
    今年头三个月里，各省市也积累了许多防治工作经验。上海市嘉定县在全面灭螺的群众运动中，由于先发宣传手册，交代技术标准，而且订了由群众自己检查、评比的验收制度，灭螺的质量很高，全县一千三百多条河沟，都经过群众戽水抽干后进行灭螺。现在群众又自己选出了骨干，作为防治运动的群众技术指导员；并且还提出定人、定时、定质、定量、定工分的“五定”办法。在粪便管理方面，许多地区都注意结合群众切身利益进行宣传，启发群众自觉性，结合积肥，建立专人负责制度。湖南省常德专区已有50％的船只做好了管理粪便工作，其余的船只也都在设置便桶和粪缸了。
    目前各地已都进入春耕时节。湖北、湖南、江西、江苏等省结合生产大检查，都正在进行血吸虫病防治工作检查。已经基本消灭血吸虫病的地区将受到深入复查，再加一把劲，努力彻底消灭血吸虫病。（附图片）
