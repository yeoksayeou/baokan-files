Why are Wuhan's "Skodas" Breaking Down So Quickly?

    Recently, I traveled to Wuhan and took the public bus several times. I found that the Wuhan Public Bus Company had some shortcomings in its work:

    First, I felt that the public buses in Wuhan were not well maintained, and the degree of damage was shocking. Take bus route 10 as an example. All the buses on this route are the best quality and most famous "Skoda" brand large sedans, but now there is no trace of new cars to be found. The most severely damaged is bus number 306. The pneumatic device for the automatic switch door on this car is broken, the small horn doesn't work, the leather seats are patched, the paint on the handles has peeled off completely, the indicator light at the rear of the car is also broken, and the surface of the car is very dirty, and there are places that have been hit and damaged.

    Secondly, the service personnel on the bus are not enthusiastic or amiable towards passengers.

    I feel that the Wuhan Public Bus Company's maintenance of its buses is not as good as Beijing's. The service attitude of bus drivers and conductors in Beijing is generally enthusiastic and amiable, and they help the old and young get on and off the bus. Therefore, I suggest that the comrades of the Wuhan Public Bus Company should learn from Beijing in terms of bus maintenance and service attitude.

    武汉的“斯科达”为什么破得这样快？
    最近我去武汉旅行一次，坐了几次公共汽车，发现武汉市公共汽车公司的工作有缺点：
    首先我感到武汉市公共汽车保养得不好，破损程度非常惊人。以10路汽车为例。这一路的汽车全是质量最好的、最有名的“斯科达”牌大型轿车，可是现在连一点新车的痕迹都找不到。破损比较严重的是306号汽车，这辆车上的自动开关车门的风动装置已经坏了，小喇叭不响了，皮座椅打上了补绽，把手上的漆皮掉得一干二净，车后边的指示灯也坏了，车的表面很脏，还有撞坏的地方。
    其次是车上服务员对待乘客不热情、不和蔼。
    我感到武汉市公共汽车公司对汽车的保养不如北京。北京市公共汽车司机和售票员的服务态度，普遍热情和蔼，做到扶老携幼上下车。因此我建议武汉市公共汽车公司的同志们，在汽车保养和服务态度方面，应该向北京市看齐。
