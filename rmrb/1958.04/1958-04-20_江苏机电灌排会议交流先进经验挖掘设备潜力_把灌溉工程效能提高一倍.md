(Xinhua Daily News) The Jiangsu Provincial Water Conservancy Department and the Provincial Agricultural Water Conservancy Trade Union jointly held a conference of advanced producer representatives of electromechanical irrigation and drainage from the 8th to the 14th to exchange advanced experiences and tap the potential of existing engineering equipment. It was decided to increase the effectiveness of existing irrigation projects by more than double, with electromechanical irrigation expanding from the original 7 million mu to over 18 million mu.
	Jiangsu Province has great potential in electromechanical irrigation and drainage equipment. By the end of 1957, there were 7,835 water pumps, totaling over 147,000 horsepower, put into production throughout the province. Under the situation of a great leap forward in agricultural production, electromechanical irrigation and drainage workers in various places have actively created and improved tools to tap the potential of existing equipment, and a large number of advanced units and individuals have emerged in the past year. Forty advanced units and seventy-three advanced producers were rewarded at this conference. The conference also displayed their sixteen important creations and improvements, which greatly improved irrigation efficiency. For example, Hengshe Pumping Station in Wuxi County, adopted the method of using local materials, utilized the dragon bone carts commonly used by the masses, and successfully experimented with using a 25-horsepower water pump to pull eight wooden carts, with an average of 127 mu of irrigated land per horsepower, more than double the provincial average of 50 mu per horsepower in 1957. The Changshu County Irrigation Management Office, based on the original axial-flow water pump, successfully modified the wooden tube axial-flow water pump, which not only reduced the cost and saved steel but also doubled the water output compared to the same horsepower water pump, enabling one machine to exert the effectiveness of two. Jianyang Station in Jianhu County implemented planned water use, equipped with full-time water release personnel, and merged fifteen machine outlets into twelve, reducing the moving time of machine boats, and increasing the irrigated area per horsepower of the water pump by more than 20%. These creations and improvements have provided a reliable guarantee for Jiangsu Province to tap irrigation potential and expand electromechanical irrigation areas.
	Based on on-site visits, demonstrations, and summarizing and exchanging advanced experiences to tap the potential of existing projects and equipment, the conference discussed and proposed indicators and measures for irrigation management in the province in 1958. Fully tap the potential of existing water pumps, doubling and adding 20% on the basis of the average of 50 mu of irrigated land per horsepower in 1957, to achieve an average of 120 mu of irrigated land per horsepower, and strive to break through 150 mu; the efficiency of wind and animal power water lifting tools should be increased by 50% to 100% compared to the original; at the same time, give full play to the potential of water use, improve the utilization rate of water, and achieve more than 15,000 mu of irrigated land per flow rate and more than 100,000 mu of irrigated dry land. At the meeting, a heat wave of challenge and competition was universally set off between special districts, counties, stations, and individuals, and action slogans such as "Tap Potential, Break Quotas," "Northern Jiangsu Surpasses Southern Jiangsu," "Southern Jiangsu Doubles Several Times," "Compare Measures Now, Compare Actions Back Home, and Compare Results in the Autumn" were put forward. The competition condition for the Wuxi Suburban Irrigation Company is to undertake the original irrigation and drainage tasks of one hundred units with thirty water pumps.
	In order to promote a great leap forward in irrigation management in the province, the conference adopted a proposal to carry out a socialist competition in irrigation management work throughout the province, and decided to carry out friendly competition with fraternal provinces, cities, and autonomous regions across the country. Representatives from fifteen fraternal provinces, cities, and autonomous regions who participated in the meeting also expressed their agreement to carry out inter-provincial competition.

    江苏机电灌排会议交流先进经验挖掘设备潜力
    把灌溉工程效能提高一倍
    本报讯　据新华日报消息：江苏省水利厅和省农业水利工会，8日至14日联合召开了全省机电灌排先进生产者代表会议，交流先进经验，挖掘了现有工程设备潜力，决定把现有灌溉工程的效能提高一倍以上，其中机电灌溉从原有的七百多万亩扩大到一千八百万亩以上。
    江苏省机电灌排原有设备潜力很大，截至1957年底，全省投入生产的抽水机有七千八百三十五台、十四万七千余马力。在农业生产大跃进的形势下，各地机电灌排工作者都积极创造改进工具，挖掘原有设备潜力，一年来涌现了大批的先进单位和先进人物。在这次会议上受到奖励的有四十个先进单位和七十三个先进生产者。会上并展出了他们的十六项重要创造和改进。这些创造大大提高了灌溉效率。如无锡县横?抽水机站，采取就地取材的办法，利用群众普遍有的龙骨车，试验成功用一台二十五马力抽水机拖八部木车，平均每马力灌田达一百二十七亩，超过1957年全省平均每马力灌溉五十亩的一倍以上。常熟县灌溉管理所，在原有轴流式水泵的基础上，改制成功木管轴流式水泵，不但降低了造价，节约了钢材，而且出水量较同样马力抽水机提高一倍，使一台机发挥两台机的效能。建湖县建阳站试行了计划用水，配备了专职放水员，将十五个机口归并为十二个机口，减少机船移动时间，使抽水机每马力灌溉面积提高了20％以上。这些创造和改进，对江苏省挖掘灌溉潜力，扩大机电灌溉面积，提供了可靠的保证。
    会议在通过实物参观表演和总结交流先进经验，挖掘现有工程、设备潜力的基础上，讨论提出了全省1958年灌溉管理工作的指标和措施。充分挖掘现有抽水机的潜力，在1957年每马力平均灌田五十亩的基础上翻一翻，加两成，做到平均每马力灌田一百二十亩，争取突破一百五十亩；风力、畜力提水工具，要比原来工效提高50％到100％；同时，发挥用水潜力，提高水的利用率，做到每个流量灌田一万五千亩以上，浇灌旱地十万亩以上。会上，专区与专区、县与县、站与站、个人与个人之间，普遍掀起了挑应战竞赛热潮，提出了：“挖掘潜力，突破定额”，“苏北越苏南”，“苏南翻几翻”，“现在比措施，回去比行动，秋后比成果”等行动口号。无锡市郊区灌溉公司的竞赛条件是：以三十台抽水机担负原有一百台的灌排任务。
    为了推动全省灌溉管理工作大跃进，会议通过了开展全省灌溉管理工作社会主义竞赛倡议书，并决定和全国各兄弟省市（自治区），开展友谊竞赛。参加会议的十五个兄弟省、市、自治区的代表，也表示同意开展省际竞赛。
