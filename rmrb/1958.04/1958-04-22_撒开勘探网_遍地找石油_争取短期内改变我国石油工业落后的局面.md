Xinhua News Agency, Nanchong, April 21st: The Ministry of Petroleum Industry convened a national petroleum exploration conference in Nanchong from April 10th to 18th. After studying and discussing the situation of natural petroleum industries in various regions, the conference pointed out that the current situation of China's natural petroleum resources has undergone great changes. As long as petroleum industrial departments in various regions earnestly implement the policy of "natural petroleum and synthetic petroleum advancing simultaneously," "the whole people engaging in petroleum," and "combining large, medium, and small enterprises," China's petroleum industry, which has a weak foundation, has the potential to catch up with other industries by leaps and bounds within the Second Five-Year Plan.

After large-scale geological exploration during the First Five-Year Plan, China not only found large oilfields and oil and gas regions with great prospects but also discovered many dispersed natural petroleum resources. Therefore, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry decided that during the Second Five-Year Plan, it will rapidly strengthen key development, rely on local areas to establish small and medium-sized petroleum industries, cast a wide exploration net to find oil everywhere, and let China's natural petroleum industry blossom all over the country.

Based on the resource situation already grasped, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry is currently carrying out key construction and development in the Yumen Oilfield, the Karamay Oil Region, the Central Sichuan Oil Region, and the Qaidam Basin. In addition to continuing to explore new oil reservoirs in the Laojunmiao Oilfield and expanding crude oil reserves, the Yumen Oilfield will begin developing the Ya'erxia and Baiyanghe Oilfields this year, gradually increasing crude oil production. According to the increased production and conservation plan formulated by the employees, crude oil production will more than double by 1962 compared to this year. The Karamay Oil Region has already proven considerable crude oil reserves during the First Five-Year Plan. During the National Petroleum Exploration Conference, news of new exploratory wells producing oil continued to come in, and the oil region is still expanding. Now, the Xinjiang Petroleum Administration has begun oilfield development and construction in this area. According to the increased production and conservation plan formulated by the employees in this region, the crude oil production is expected to reach more than three million tons by 1962. With the support of the whole country, the Central Sichuan Oil Region is currently strengthening exploration while preparing for production. In addition, the Qaidam Basin will continue to explore more crude oil reserves and will decide to increase the scale of development based on transportation conditions.

In order to find more reserve resources, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry has organized forces this year to continue exploration and newly opened up the Turpan Basin in Xinjiang, the southern, eastern, and southern Dabashan areas of Sichuan, the Anshun area of Guizhou, and a large number of exploration areas such as Baotou and Yinchuan. The Ministry is also cooperating with the Ministry of Geology to carry out large-scale geological work in the Songliao Plain and the northern Jiangsu Plain. These areas have now obtained very good oil and gas geological data.

The National Petroleum Exploration Conference criticized the past erroneous view of a small number of people who did not pay attention to the exploitation of small oilfields and shallow oil layers, and decided that in the future, it would adopt measures that are appropriate to local conditions and make do with whatever is available, actively help local areas develop small and medium-sized petroleum industries. Wherever small oilfields and shallow oil layers are discovered, the petroleum industry departments will provide typical demonstrations and impart methods of refining petroleum using local methods.

The conference emphasized that political and ideological work must be greatly strengthened in the future, all positive factors must be mobilized, and China's natural petroleum industry must be pushed to a new stage of development. Based on the characteristics of the petroleum industry, the Ministry of Petroleum Industry has put forward ten systems for strengthening well team work in the future and decided to immediately establish well team political instructors to ensure the high organization and combat effectiveness of the well teams.

    撒开勘探网　遍地找石油
    争取短期内改变我国石油工业落后的局面
    新华社南充21日电　石油工业部4月10日到18日在南充召开了全国石油勘探会议。会议研究和讨论了各地天然石油工业的情况以后指出，目前我国天然石油资源的情况已经起了很大变化。各地石油工业部门只要认真贯彻“天然石油和人造石油齐头并进”、“全民搞石油”、“大中小企业相结合”的方针，我国基础薄弱的石油工业就有可能在第二个五年计划内大踏步地赶上其他工业。
    经过第一个五年计划大规模的地质勘探，我国不仅找到了大油田和远景希望很大的油气区，还发现了许多分散的天然石油资源。因此石油工业部决定在第二个五年计划期间，要迅速加强重点开发，依靠地方兴办中小型石油工业，撒开勘探网遍地找油，让我国天然石油工业来个遍地开花。
    根据目前已经掌握的资源情况，石油工业部现在已经进行重点建设和开发的有玉门油矿、克拉玛依油区、川中油区和柴达木盆地。玉门油矿除了继续探明老君庙油田的新油藏、扩大原油储量以外，今年将着手开发鸭儿峡和白杨河油田，逐年增加原油产量，根据职工订的增产节约计划，到1962年原油产量将比今年增加一倍以上。克拉玛依油区在第一个五年计划内已经探明了相当数量的原油储量，在全国石油勘探会议期间，又不断传出新探井喷油的消息，油区范围还在不断扩大。现在新疆石油管理局已经在这个地区着手进行油田开发建设工作。按照这个地区职工订的增产节约计划，预计到1962年的原油产量将达到三百万吨以上。川中油区在全国支援下，目前正在一面加强勘探一面进行生产准备。此外，柴达木盆地除了继续探明更多的原油储量以外，将根据交通条件决定增大开发规模。
    为了寻找更多的后备资源，石油工业部今年已组织力量继续勘探和新开辟了新疆的吐鲁番盆地，四川的南部、东部和大巴山南部，贵州安顺地区，以及包头、银川等大批探区。这个部还配合地质部在松辽平原、苏北平原展开大范围的地质工作。这些地区现在都已经获得了很好的油气地质资料。
    这次全国石油勘探会议批判了过去少数人不重视小油田和浅油层开采的错误观点，决定今后采取因地制宜、因陋就简的办法，积极帮助地方发展中小型石油工业，凡是在发现小油田和浅油层的地方，都由石油工业部门作典型示范，传授土法炼制石油的方法。
    会议强调今后要大力加强政治思想工作，调动一切积极因素，把我国天然石油工业推上一个新的发展阶段。石油工业部根据石油工业的特点提出了今后加强井队工作的十条制度，决定立即设立井队政治指导员，保证井队高度的组织性和战斗性。
