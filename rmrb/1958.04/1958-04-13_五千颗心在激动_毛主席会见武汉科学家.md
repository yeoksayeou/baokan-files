Five Thousand Hearts are Thrilled
——Chairman Mao Meets Wuhan Scientists

The city of Wuhan, on the banks of the Yangtze River, is full of spring vitality. On April 6th, a Sunday when a hundred flowers were blooming, more than five thousand scientific workers in the Wuhan area held a grand rally at the Wuhan Sports Stadium to pledge themselves to the Great Leap Forward in the scientific community. Old and young scientific workers, one after another, swore an oath to the meeting, and a series of exciting words were broadcast from the loudspeakers:

	"Confess our hearts to the Party,
	Confess our hearts to the 600 million people,
	Confess our hearts to Chairman Mao!"

At that very moment – 12:42 PM – the executive chairman of the meeting announced to everyone: Now I have the best news to report to everyone: Our great leader Chairman Mao is coming to our venue to meet everyone. Before the words were finished, everyone in the hall stood up, and thunderous applause immediately erupted.

At 12:43 PM, the door at the eastern entrance of the venue opened, and Chairman Mao, accompanied by Comrades Li Xiannian, Ke Qingshi, Wang Renzhong, Song Kanfu, and Li Da, entered the venue. Instantly, a storm of applause and cheers of "Long live Chairman Mao" resounded throughout the hall. Many people jumped up from their seats.

Chairman Mao was wearing a silver-gray uniform today, his face was radiant, his hair was full and black, his spirit was bright, and he looked very healthy. He walked to the rostrum amidst applause and cheers, and shook hands with the comrades of the presidium one by one.

While shaking hands, Chairman Mao talked with everyone. Everyone asked Chairman Mao how he was and wished Chairman Mao good health, briefly introducing their work situation. When Chairman Mao extended his hand to Bao Ding, the chairman of the Wuhan branch of the Architectural Society of China, Bao Ding held Chairman Mao's hand tightly for a long time, tears welling up in his eyes, he said excitedly: "The first time I saw you was in 1950, eight years later, today, I see you again. I feel sorry for you, I have made very slow progress in the past eight years. I guarantee today that I will leap forward." Chairman Mao immediately encouraged him and said: "Very good, very good."

After shaking hands with the members of the presidium, Chairman Mao went to the front of the stage and waved to everyone, and the applause and cheers reached a new climax at this time. Thousands of beating hearts condensed into a red heart, all facing Chairman Mao. Thousands of pairs of eyes did not leave Chairman Mao for a single second. After Chairman Mao walked around the venue, he stood in the center of the stage and continued to respond to everyone's respects. Young female scientific workers walked out of the crowd and presented bouquets of flowers to Chairman Mao. The crowd began to sing "The East is Red."

At this time, Chairman Mao asked Director Li Da next to him: "Which units are attending the meeting?" Li Da replied: "The Wuhan Branch of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, enterprise research units, and universities and colleges." Chairman Mao saw that there were many young people in the crowd, and praised: "There are quite a few young lads!" Li Da told Chairman Mao that they were mostly young researchers and teaching assistants.

At 12:53 PM, Chairman Mao began to leave the venue. When he was about to approach the exit, Professor Tan Jiefu, who was over seventy years old, rushed forward and shouted: "Chairman!" Chairman Mao stopped immediately and shook his hand. Chairman Mao asked with concern: "How is your health now?" Professor Tan said: "It's okay." Chairman Mao asked again: "Can you still do research work?" Professor Tan said: "Yes."

At this time, Chairman Mao left the venue amidst applause and cheers.

After bidding farewell to Chairman Mao with the highest joy and happiness, the scientific workers immediately held a solemn oath-taking ceremony. The great image is firmly engraved in everyone's minds, and he will always inspire people to move forward. People used steely language to express their determination: "We are determined to thoroughly transform ourselves, eradicate bourgeois ideology, establish proletarian ideology, and strive to be both red and expert, red through and expert deep, to become true proletarian intellectuals, and always be promoters of socialist construction, dedicating all our strength to the cause of socialism."

    五千颗心在激动
    ——毛主席会见武汉科学家
    扬子江畔的城市——武汉，充满着春的活力。4月6日，一个百花争艳的星期天，武汉地区五千多名科学工作者，在武汉体育馆举行了科学界大跃进誓师大会，年老的和年轻的科学工作者，一个接一个地向大会宣誓，一连串激动人心的语言从扩音器传播出来：
    “向党交心，
    向六亿人民交心，
    向毛主席交心！”
    就在这个时刻——十二点四十二分，大会执行主席向大家宣布：现在向大家报告一个最好的消息：我们的伟大领袖毛主席马上要来到我们的会场，和大家见面。话音未落，这时全场的人都站立起来，会场上顿时响起了雷动的掌声。
    十二点四十三分，会场东面入口处的门打开了，毛主席由李先念同志、柯庆施同志、王任重同志、宋侃夫同志、李达同志陪同，走进了会场。顿时，暴风雨般的掌声，“毛主席万岁”的欢呼声，响彻了全场。许多人从座位上跳起来。
    毛主席今天穿银灰色制服，红光满面，满头黑发，神彩奕奕，显得非常健康。他在掌声和欢呼声中走到主席台，和主席团的同志们一一握手。
    毛主席一边握手，一边和大家谈话，大家都问毛主席好，祝毛主席健康，向毛主席简单地介绍自己的工作情况。当毛主席把手伸向中国建筑学会武汉分会理事长鲍鼎的时候，鲍鼎紧紧握住毛主席的手久久不放，他激动得泪花直涌地说：“我第一次见到您是1950年，八年后的今天，第二次又见到您，我感到对不起您，八年来我进步得很慢，我今天提出保证，我一定飞跃地前进。”毛主席马上鼓励他说：“很好，很好。”
    和主席团人员握手后，毛主席又到台前，向大家招手致意，掌声、欢呼声这时达到了新高潮。千百颗跳动的心凝成了一颗红心，都向着毛主席。千百双眼睛一分一秒都没有离开毛主席。毛主席绕场一圈后，伫立在台中央，继续回答大家的敬意。青年女科学工作者们从人群中走出来，把一束束的鲜花，献给了毛主席，人群中唱起了“东方红”。
    这时，毛主席问旁边的李达主任：“出席会议的是那些单位？”李达回答说：“科学院武汉分院、企业研究单位、大专学校。”毛主席看到人群中有许多青年，就称赞地说：“青年小伙子还不少呀！”李达告诉毛主席说：他们大都是青年研究人员和助教。
    十二点五十三分，毛主席开始离开会场，快要走近出口处的时候，七十多岁的老教授谭戒甫赶上前去，喊了一声：“主席！”毛主席马上停了下来，握住了他的手。毛主席关心地说：“你现在身体还好吗？”谭老教授说：“还好。”毛主席又问：“还可以作研究工作吗？”谭老教授说：“可以。”
    这时，毛主席才在掌声和欢呼声中离开了会场。
    科学工作者们怀着最高的喜悦和幸福的心情，送别了毛主席以后，马上就举行了庄严的宣誓。伟大的形象牢牢地刻在每个人的脑海中，他将永远激励着人们前进。人们用钢铁般的语言，表明了自己的决心：“我们决心彻底改造自己，破除资产阶级思想，树立无产阶级思想，力争又红又专，红透专深，成为真正的无产阶级的知识分子，永远做个社会主义建设的促进派，为社会主义事业献出一切力量。”（原载“长江日报”）
