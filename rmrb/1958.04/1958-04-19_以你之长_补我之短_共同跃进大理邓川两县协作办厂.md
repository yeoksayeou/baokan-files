Xinhua News Agency, Kunming, 18th - Dali County and Dengchuan County in the Dali Bai Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, are learning from each other's strengths and working side-by-side to jointly establish factories. At present, the mirabilite, iron, and coal mines jointly operated by the two counties are being built and put into production simultaneously. In addition, the two counties will also jointly operate silver, lead, and saltpeter mines in Dengchuan.

Dali County and Dengchuan County are adjacent to each other. Dali County is one of the main grain-producing areas of the autonomous prefecture, with a population of over 110,000. While it has better conditions in terms of capital and labor for developing local industries, it lacks many essential resources such as iron and coal. However, Dengchuan County, with a population of just over 60,000, is rich in mineral resources, but development is difficult due to the small population. In order to support each other and jointly solve their respective special difficulties, the leaders of Dali and Dengchuan, after consultation and discussion, decided that Dengchuan County would support Dali with various raw materials, while Dali County would contribute money, people, and products to help Dengchuan. The two sides signed a contract to jointly establish industries in Dengchuan County. According to the contract, the two counties will jointly operate iron, mirabilite, and coal mines in Dengchuan County, with the total output value of iron and coal reaching 2.46 million yuan this year. The total investment in these three factories and mines is 26,000 yuan, of which Dali County invests 16,000 yuan, and Dengchuan County invests 10,000 yuan. About 70% of the labor force and leading cadres required for the joint venture factories and mines will be dispatched by Dali County to solve the problem.

The cooperation between these two counties in running industries enables both parties to draw on the strengths of others and make up for their own weaknesses, ensuring that local industries in both counties can leap forward. The iron factory and chemical fertilizer factory that Dali County has just established were originally restricted by raw materials. Now that the raw materials are guaranteed, these two factories can also develop boldly. Dengchuan County, which originally felt difficulties in terms of manpower and funds, has also received support from its wealthy neighbors. The three factories and mines jointly operated by the two counties will distribute the output value on a "four-six" basis, with Dengchuan County receiving 60%, so that this year it will be able to receive 1.47 million yuan, accounting for 15% of Dengchuan County's estimated local industrial output value this year. In addition, the new agricultural tools and chemical fertilizers produced by the Dali County Iron Factory will also be able to support Dengchuan.

    以你之长　补我之短
  　共同跃进大理邓川两县协作办厂
    新华社昆明18日电　云南省大理白族自治州的大理县和邓川县，相互取长补短，并肩作战，协作办工厂。现在，两县合办的芒硝、铁、煤等厂矿已边建设，边投入生产。此外，两县还将在邓川合办银、铅、火硝等矿。
    大理县和邓川县互相毗邻。大理县是自治州粮食主要产区之一，有十一万多人口，在发展地方工业中，虽然资金和劳动力条件较好，但缺乏铁、煤等许多必需的资源。但是，只有六万多人口的邓川县，矿藏资源却很丰富，因为人少开发有困难。为了相互支援，共同解决各自的特殊困难，大理和邓川的领导人经过协商和讨论，决定邓川县支援大理以各种原料，大理县则出钱出人出产品帮助邓川。双方签订了在邓川县合办工业的合同。根据合同，两县在邓川县境合办铁、芒硝、煤等厂矿，今年生产铁、煤的总产值可达到二百四十六万元。这三个厂矿共投资二万六千元，其中，大理县投资一万六千元。邓川县出一万元。合办厂矿所需的劳动力和领导干部，有70％左右由大理县派出解决。
    这两县协作办工业，使双方都能取他人之长，补自己之短，保证两县地方工业都能跃进。大理县刚办起的铁工厂和制造化肥的化工厂，原来受到原料限制，现在原料有了保证，这两个工厂也就可以放心大胆的发展了。原来在人力、资金等问题上感到困难的邓川县，也从富裕的友邻处得到了支援。两县合办的三个厂矿将以“四六”分配产值，邓川县得60％，这样今年将可得到一百四十七万元，占邓川县今年预计的地方工业产值的15％。此外，大理县铁工厂生产的新式农具、化肥等产品，也将能支援邓川。
