Xinhua News Agency report: Leping County, Jiangxi Province, has recently established 57 rural spare-time junior high schools and over 500 rural spare-time elementary schools. Now, all 42 townships in the county have at least one middle school, and every commune and village has an elementary school. All primary school graduates in rural areas who were previously unable to continue their education, as well as some township and commune cadres with a primary school education level, are now participating in spare-time middle school studies. The number of middle school students in rural areas has increased from the original 100 to 1,726. 97% of the 45,500 rural children of school age who had not been enrolled have entered into people-run elementary schools to study.

These rural spare-time middle and elementary schools adopt various teaching forms to ensure that students can both study and not delay production and work. For spare-time middle schools with a large number of cadre students, classes are scheduled in the morning to accommodate cadres' evening work and meetings. For spare-time middle schools with a large number of primary school graduates, classes are held in the evening. Many of the students in spare-time elementary schools are children who herd cattle. These elementary schools have also adopted various methods such as early classes, noon classes, evening classes, half-day classes, or mobile teaching and field teaching.

    教学形式多种多样
    乐平县普及小学教育
    据新华社讯　江西省乐平县最近办起了五十七所农村业余初级中学和五百多所农村业余小学。全县四十二个乡，现在乡乡有了一个以上的中学，并且做到社社、村村有小学。原来农村未能升学的全部高小毕业生和部分具有高小文化程度的乡、社干部，现在都参加了业余中学学习，农村中学生由原来的一百名增加到了一千七百二十六名。四万五千五百名未入学的农村适龄儿童有97％进入了民办小学学习。
    这些农村业余中、小学采用多种教学形式，使学生既能学习，又不耽误生产和工作。干部学员多的业余中学，为照顾干部晚上工作、开会，都规定在早晨上课。高小毕业生多的业余中学，则在晚上时间上课。业余小学的学生很多是牧牛的儿童。这些小学也分别采取了早班、中午班、晚班、半日上课制或巡回教学、田间教学的办法。
