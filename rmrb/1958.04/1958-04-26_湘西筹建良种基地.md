Xinhua News Agency report:

　　Xiangxi Tujia and Miao Autonomous Prefecture plans to establish over 1,640 superior breed production bases this year for pigs, cattle, fish, rabbits, bees, timber forests, oranges, medicinal materials, ramie, and sugar beets. This initiative aims to significantly improve the declining quality of local breeds in the mountainous areas and promote an all-around leap forward in agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, fishing, and sideline production.

　　In the past, the degradation of local superior breeds in Xiangxi was severe. The famous Xiangxi cattle degenerated, becoming short and weak. Pigs, after a year of feeding, would only grow to 100 jin (50 kg). Fish, released into the water in March, would only weigh half a jin (250 g) when harvested in August. Chinese fir, tung trees, and oil tea plants grew in a mixed and disorderly fashion. This situation was not conducive to meeting the needs of developing the mountainous region. The autonomous prefecture's leadership decided to establish superior breed breeding bases at the prefectural and county levels, based on prioritizing grain production and ensuring its steady growth year by year. They will conduct scientific breeding, cultivation, and reproduction work and have established an Agricultural Science and Technology Research Guidance Committee to strengthen technical guidance.

    湘西筹建良种基地
    据新华社讯　湘西土家族苗族自治州今年将要建成猪、牛、鱼、兔、蜂、用材林、柑桔、药材、苎麻、甜菜等良种生产基地一千六百四十多处，以大力改变山区品种衰退的状况，促使农、林、牧、渔、副业生产全面跃进。
    湘西本地良种过去衰退严重。著名的湘西牛退化得体矮不壮，生猪喂一年只能长一百斤，鱼从3月放下水，8月捞出来只有半斤重，杉松、油桐、油茶混杂生长。这种情况与发展山区建设的要求很不适应。自治州领导部门决定在优先发展粮食生产、保证粮食逐年增长的基础上，建立州、县良种繁殖基地，进行科学的饲养、培育、繁殖工作，并成立农业科学技术研究指导委员会，加强技术指导。
