    Making "Recession Fortune"

    General Manager Mortimer of General Foods in the United States recently put forward a very touching slogan: "Recession fever is more contagious than the Asian flu." The purpose of putting forward this slogan is to launch a so-called anti-recession "propaganda campaign" for a period of four months. According to him, this campaign "should raise 15 million U.S. dollars to be used for advertising space and advertising time."
    Why spend so much money on advertising to launch a propaganda campaign? It's not surprising when you say it bluntly. The General Manager of this food company is also the Chairman of the Industrial Advisory Committee of the American Advertising Association, representing the interests of the entire advertising industry. The drunkard's intention is not in the wine; it turns out that Mortimer wants to make a recession fortune during the economic depression.

### 发“衰退财”

    发“衰退财”
    美国通用食品公司总经理摩蒂默最近提出一个很动人的口号：“衰退热症比亚洲流行性感冒的传染性更大”。提出这个口号的目的是为了发起一个为期四个月的所谓反衰退“宣传运动”。据他说，这个运动“应该筹集一千五百万美元用在广告篇幅和广告时间上”。
    要发起一个宣传运动为什么要花那么多钱在广告上呢？说穿了也不奇怪，这位食品公司的总经理也是美国广告协会工业顾问委员会主席，是代表一切广告业的利益的。醉翁之意不在酒，原来摩蒂默是想乘经济大衰退之时发一笔衰退财。
