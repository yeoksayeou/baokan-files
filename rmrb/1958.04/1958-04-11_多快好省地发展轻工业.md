The National Light Industrial Products Exhibition sponsored by the Ministry of Light Industry of the Central Government has opened. On display are tens of thousands of rich, colorful, high-quality daily necessities, food products, and handicrafts. This not only demonstrates the achievements of the national light industry during the First Five-Year Plan period, but also points out the direction of the Second Five-Year Plan, which has already begun. This exhibition will surely promote a great leap forward in the national light industry.

At this exhibition, people can see that China's light industry has fundamentally changed the face of light industry in old China. In old China, the foundation of light industry was pitifully weak and the technology was extremely backward. After the liberation, although this situation changed during the recovery period, there was not enough time for fundamental transformation. Then, during the First Five-Year Plan period, through the great socialist transformation movement, China's light industry underwent fundamental changes. The rapid development of the metallurgical industry, the machinery industry, and the chemical industry created the prerequisites for the development of light industry; the realization of the socialist transformation of agriculture liberated agricultural productive forces, providing abundant raw material resources and opening up markets for the development of light industry; and the realization of the socialist transformation of capitalist industry and commerce and handicrafts fully unleashed the production potential of light industry.

Relying on the joint efforts of all employees, the national light industry developed rapidly during the First Five-Year Plan period. The total output value of daily-use light industry and the food industry increased by more than double, with an average annual increase of 15.2%; the total output value of handicrafts increased by 86.3%, with an average annual increase of 13.3%. The output of products also increased significantly, with fourteen of the twenty-nine major products increasing by more than two times; four increasing by more than one time; and the other eleven products also increasing to varying degrees. The variety of light industrial products also increased. Products that we could not manufacture in the past, such as many industrial papers (electrical insulation paper, capacitor paper, cable paper, steel paper, radio facsimile paper, tracing paper, cellophane), bicycles, cameras, watches, saccharin, furfural, refined alcohol, etc., can now be manufactured. Products that we have always relied on imports for, such as radios, newsprint, bicycles, sewing machines, aromatics, alcohol, etc., are now not only self-sufficient, but have also become export goods. Various radios, newsprint, high-grade cigarettes, porcelain, beer, fruit wine, canned fruit, and many special food and handicraft products produced in China have won a good reputation in foreign markets. By-products that were completely unused or rarely used in the past, such as beet pulp, distiller's grains, fruit peels and residues, starch residues, carbon dioxide, cottonseed hulls, bittern, and ōbā, have now begun to be utilized; and some raw materials that were discarded on the ground or improperly used in the past, such as various grass fibers, wild oilseeds, wild wine materials, mountain fruits, and pigskins, have begun to be used in large quantities. This not only expanded the raw materials for light industry, but also played a certain role in promoting rural economic prosperity and supporting industrial and agricultural production.

The total amount of national investment in light industry capital construction during the First Five-Year Plan period reached 1.26 billion yuan. The newly added production capacity in five years was: 268,000 tons of paper, 299,000 tons of pulp, 1.44 million tons of salt, 350,000 tons of oil (raw material processing capacity), 650,000 tons of sugar, 3.27 million pairs of rubber shoes, 6.63 million pieces of ceramics, 5.3 million enamel washbasins, and 6 million thermos bottles. Equipment for large-scale paper mills and sugar refineries, which previously relied entirely on imports, can now be designed and manufactured. Building a paper mill with a daily output of 100 tons of relief printing paper used to take three and a half years and 30 million yuan in investment. Now it only takes two years and 15 million yuan in investment. Similar changes have taken place in the construction time and investment amount of the sugar industry and other industries.

We have made considerable achievements in production technology. Many important technical and economic indicators of light industry have taken a big step forward compared with five years ago. The reed pulp cooking time of Tianjin Paper Mill, the wood pulp cooking time of Shixian and Kaishantun Paper Mills, the residual oil rate of dry cake of Luda Grease Chemical General Factory, and the starch utilization rate of Jinan and Nanyang Alcohol Factories have all reached or created advanced international indicators. The advanced experiences of the Li Chuanjiang soybean oil extraction method in the oil industry, the Yantai Winery operation method in the brewing industry, and the sea salt operation method represented by Liu Guoxi have all blossomed and borne fruit in these industries. In the oil industry alone, from 1955 to 1957, 610,000 tons of oil were produced due to increased oil yield and the opening up of new oil sources.

During this period, the national light industry accumulated a large amount of funds for the country, playing a significant role in supporting national construction. The food industry alone accumulated 15 billion yuan in funds, equivalent to 20 times the total amount of national investment in the food industry. The foreign exchange earned by exporting light industrial products amounted to 2 billion yuan in RMB, which could be exchanged for 4.08 million tons of various steels or 12.8 million tons of chemical fertilizers.

Due to the development of light industrial production, the people's consumption level of these products has been significantly improved. In 1957, the average per capita annual paper consumption increased by 120% compared with 1952; the sugar consumption increased by 60% compared with 1952; and the alcohol consumption increased by 20% compared with 1952.

These achievements are something that the workers of the national light industry and handicrafts can be proud of. However, we will never be satisfied with past achievements. The new situation has presented us with new tasks. The general program for socialist construction put forward by the Party Central Committee, with the development of heavy industry as the center and industry and agriculture developing simultaneously, the call to catch up with and surpass the total output value of agriculture in a certain number of years in different regions, and the great leap forward in all aspects of work that has come with the rectification movement, require light industry to also achieve a great leap forward by developing in a faster, better, and more economical way, exerting all its strength, and striving for the top.

In accordance with the general policy of national construction, combined with the characteristics of light industry and handicrafts, the specific policy for light industry in the future is: to rely on the masses and rely on local areas to develop light industry under the overall planning of the central and local party committees; to combine with production such as agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fishery, to go up the mountains and down to the countryside, to serve the development of rural and mountainous economies; to combine large, medium, and small sizes, with medium and small sizes as the main focus, to run more small factories, and to develop the sideline production of agricultural cooperatives processing agricultural and sideline products, to comprehensively utilize raw materials, to actively expand raw material resources, to vigorously improve product quality, to expand varieties, and to reduce costs; to fully utilize existing enterprises and original equipment, to be simple and economical, and to run enterprises diligently and thriftily; to engage in multiple production and concurrent operations, and to fully utilize existing factory equipment and labor; to consolidate and improve handicraft cooperative organizations, to vigorously develop local medium and small industries on the basis of existing handicraft cooperatives, to serve agriculture production facing the rural areas, and to actively realize the technical transformation of handicrafts.

After the education of the anti-waste and anti-conservatism movement, the situation of a great leap forward in the national light industry has already taken shape. We believe that light industry must bloom everywhere in the country, and that the workers of the national light industry and handicrafts will surely continue to adhere to their energy and diligence, and comprehensively fulfill the tasks assigned to them by the Party and the people in a faster, better, and more economical way. Two years ago, a National Daily-Use Industrial Products Quality Exhibition was held in Beijing. That exhibition criticized certain light industrial products through comparison of good and bad, which played a role in promoting and advancing. Many enterprises that were named and criticized in the past for their low-quality products, such as the deteriorated washbasins produced by the Shijiazhuang Enamel Factory, are now meeting everyone at the National Light Industrial Products Exhibition with a new look.

However, the development of things is always uneven. The current issue is that the advanced should be even more advanced, and the backward should catch up with the advanced. Through this exhibition, let us further compare with the advanced and catch up with the advanced, and set off a climax of competition, to produce more rich, colorful, and high-quality daily necessities and food for the people. We hope that all employees of the light industry sector will continue to exert their efforts and develop light industry in a faster, better, and more economical way, and make further brilliant contributions to China's socialist construction.

    多快好省地发展轻工业
    中央轻工业部主办的全国轻工业产品展览会开幕了。在这次会上展出了数以万计的丰富多采、质量优美的日用品、食品和手工艺品。这不仅显示全国轻工业在第一个五年计划时期的成就，并且指出了已经开始的第二个五年的方向。这次展览会必将推动全国轻工业的大跃进。
    在这个展览会上，人们可以看到我国轻工业根本改变了旧中国轻工业的面貌。在旧中国，轻工业的基础是薄弱得可怜，技术又十分落后。解放以后经过恢复时期，这一情况虽有转变，但还来不及进行根本改造。接着在第一个五年计划时期，经过了伟大的社会主义改造运动，我国轻工业就发生了根本的变化。由于冶金工业、机械工业和化学工业等的迅速发展，为轻工业的发展创造了前提；由于实现了农业的社会主义改造，解放了农业的生产力，为轻工业的发展提供了充裕的原料资源，并且开拓了市场；由于实现了对资本主义工商业和手工业的社会主义改造，从而使轻工业的生产潜力得以充分发挥。
    依靠全体职工的共同努力，在第一个五年计划期间，全国轻工业有了较快的发展。日用轻工业和食品工业的总产值增长了一倍多，平均每年递增15.2％；手工业总产值增长了86.3％，平均每年递增13.3％。产品产量也有了很大的增长，二十九种主要产品增长两倍以上的有十四种；增长一倍以上的有四种；其他十一种产品也都有不同程度的增长。轻工业产品的品种也增加了。过去我们不能制造的，如许多工业用纸（电器绝缘纸、电容器纸、电缆纸、钢纸、无线电传真纸、描图纸、玻璃纸）、自行车、照相机、手表、糖精、糠醛、精馏酒精等产品，现在已经能够制造了。过去我们一直依靠进口的，如收音机、新闻纸、自行车、缝纫机、芳香、酒精等产品，现在不但已能自给，而且变成出口物资了。我国出产的各种收音机、新闻纸、高级卷烟、瓷器、啤酒、果酒、水果罐头和许多特产食品和手工艺品，在国外市场已经博得了良好的信誉。过去完全没有利用或很少利用的副产品，如甜菜废丝、酒糟、水果皮渣、淀粉渣子、二氧化碳、棉籽壳、苦滷、?巴等，现在已经开始利用了；过去货弃于地，或者用之不当的一些原材料，如各种草类纤维、野生油料、野生酒料、山果和猪皮等已经开始大量利用。这样不仅扩大了轻工业的原料，并且对繁荣农村经济和支援工农业生产起了一定的作用。
    国家对轻工业基本建设的投资总额在第一个五年计划期间达十二亿六千万元，五年新增生产能力是：纸二十六万八千吨，纸浆二十九万九千吨，盐一百四十四万吨，油三十五万吨（原料处理量），糖六十五万吨，胶鞋三百二十七万双，陶瓷器六百六十三万个，搪瓷脸盆五百三十万个，保温瓶六百万个。过去完全依靠进口供应的大型纸厂和糖厂的设备，现在已经能够设计和制造了。建设一个日产凸板纸一百吨的造纸厂，原来需要三年半的时间和三千万元投资，现在只需要二年的时间和一千五百万元投资了。制糖业和其他行业的建厂时间和投资额也都起了类似的变化。
    在生产技术上我们已取得了不少的成就。现在有许多轻工业的重要技术经济指标，比五年前都已经迈进了一大步。天津造纸总厂的苇浆蒸煮时间，石岘和开山屯造纸厂的木浆蒸煮时间，旅大油脂化学总厂的干粕残油率，济南和南阳酒精厂的淀粉利用率等指标，都已经达到或创造了国际先进指标。油脂工业中的李川江大豆榨油操作法、酿酒工业中烟台酒厂的操作法和以柳国喜为代表的海盐操作法等先进经验，都已经在这些工业中开花结果。其中仅油脂工业一项，从1955年到1957年，由于提高出油率，开辟新油源，就增产了油脂六十一万吨。
    这个时期全国轻工业为国家积累了大量资金，对支援国家建设起了重大的作用。仅食品工业部分就积累资金一百五十亿元，等于国家对食品工业投资总额的二十倍。轻工业产品出口换回的外汇，折合人民币达二十亿元，可换回各种钢材四百零八万吨，或化学肥料一千二百八十万吨。
    由于轻工业生产的发展，已经使人民对这些产品的消费水平有了显著的提高，1957年平均每人每年用纸量比1952年提高120％；用糖量比1952年提高了60％；用酒量比1952年提高了20％。
    这些成就是全国轻工业和手工业工人足以自豪的。但是，我们永远不会满足于过去的成就。新的形势已经给我们提出了新的任务。党中央提出的以发展重工业为中心，工业与农业并举这一社会主义建设总纲领，和要求地方工业总产值分别不同地区在一定年限内赶上和超过农业总产值的号召，以及随着整风运动而来的各方面工作的大跃进，要求轻工业也必须多快好省、鼓足干劲、力争上游，来一个大跃进。
    按照国家建设的总方针，结合轻工业和手工业的特点，今后轻工业方面的具体方针是：在中央和各地党委的全面规划下，依靠群众和依靠地方，发展轻工业；同农林渔牧等生产相结合，上山下乡，为发展农村和山区经济服务；大中小型相结合，以中小型为主，多办小厂，并发展农业合作社农副产品加工的副业生产，综合利用原材料，积极扩大原料资源，大力提高产品质量，扩大品种，降低成本；充分利用现有企业和原有设备，因陋就简，勤俭办企业；多种生产兼业经营，充分利用现有的工厂设备和劳动力；巩固和提高手工业合作组织，在现有手工业合作社的基础上大力发展地方中小型工业，面向农村，为农业生产服务，积极实现手工业的技术改造。
    经过了反浪费和反保守运动的教育，目前全国轻工业大跃进的形势已经形成。我们相信，轻工业一定要在全国遍地开花，全国轻工业和手工业职工一定能够不断地坚持干劲和钻劲，多快好省地全面地完成党和人民所给予的任务。两年前在北京曾经举办过一次全国日用工业品产品质量展览会，那个展览会通过好坏对比的方式，曾经对某些轻工业产品进行了批评，起了促进和推动作用。过去被指名批评的许多企业质量低劣的产品——如石家庄搪瓷厂生产的变质的脸盆，现在已经以新的面貌在全国轻工业产品展览会上和大家见面了。
    但是，事物的发展总是不平衡的，现在的问题是先进的要更先进，落后的要赶上先进。通过这次展览会，让我们进一步比先进、赶先进，掀起一个竞赛高潮，为人民生产更多的丰富多彩、质量优美的日用品和食品。我们希望轻工业部门的全体职工继续鼓足干劲，多快好省地发展轻工业，在我国社会主义建设中进一步做出光辉的贡献。
