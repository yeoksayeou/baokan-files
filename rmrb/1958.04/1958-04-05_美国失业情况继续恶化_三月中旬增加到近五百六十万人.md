Xinhua News Agency, April 4th, New York dispatch: Unemployment in the United States continues to grow.

Senator and economist Paul Douglas stated in the Senate on the 3rd that the number of unemployed in the United States had increased to between 5.4 million and 5.6 million by mid-March. He also pointed out that in previous years, the number of unemployed typically experienced a seasonal decrease between February and March.

The official figure for unemployment in February was 5,173,000.

A "New York Times" reporter reported that the number of workers in New York receiving unemployment benefits increased by approximately 10,000 in the past week. It is reported that the total number of unemployed in New York a week ago was 329,000. This is the fastest increase this year. Officials anticipate that the number of unemployed will continue to increase in the coming weeks. The reporter also stated that "discouraging news" is also coming from other important centers in the United States.

The latest issue of "The Nation" weekly published some materials on the unemployment situation in various industrial centers in the United States. For example, in St. Louis, the number of unemployed, even according to the officially suppressed figures, has increased by 87% compared to the same period last year. "The Nation" went on to point out that unemployment in Massachusetts accounts for 7.5% of the total workforce, and 6.5% in Los Angeles. The magazine emphasized that "the disaster in Detroit and the entire state of Michigan may be more severe than in any other region in the country. Here, unemployment accounts for nearly 15% of the total employment... Detroit has become a city of ghost factories... In Michigan, tens of thousands of automobile industry workers with ten years of seniority have been laid off."

    美国失业情况继续恶化
    三月中旬增加到近五百六十万人
    据新华社4日电　纽约消息：美国的失业在继续增长。
    参议员、经济学家保尔·道格拉斯3日在参议院说，美国失业人数在3月月中已经增加到五百四十万和五百六十万之间。他还指出，往年2、3月之间失业人数都有季节性的减少。
    2月份失业人数的官方数字是五百十七万三千人。
    “纽约时报”记者报道，上一周纽约领失业救济金的工人人数增加了大约一万人。据悉，一周以前纽约总失业人数为三十二万九千人。这是今年以来，增加最快的一次。官方人士预料在最近几周内失业人数还要增加。这个记者还说，从美国其他重要中心也传来了“令人沮丧的消息”。
    最近一期“民族”周刊发表了一些关于美国各工业中心失业状况的材料，例如，在圣路易，失业人数甚至按官方压低了的数字也比去年同期增加了87％。“民族”周刊接着指出，马萨诸塞州失业人数占工人总数的7.5％，洛杉矶占6.5％。这家杂志强调说，“底特律城和整个密执安州的灾难可能比国内任何其他地区都要重。这里失业人数几乎占全部就业人数的15％。……底特律城成了幽灵工厂的城市……密执安州有成千上万的有十年工龄的汽车工业工人被解雇”。
