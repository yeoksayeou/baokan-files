Xinhua News Agency, Wuhan, April 14th. Chairman Mao, during his stay in Wuhan, visited the Wuhan Municipal Local Industry Products Exhibition and praised the labor and creative spirit of the workers.

On the evening of April 11th, a light rain was falling, and the Wuhan Municipal Local Industry Products Exhibition, located on the shore of East Lake, was brightly lit. Here were displayed the new creations and new products of Wuhan's local industrial workers in the Great Leap Forward. That evening, the exhibition's workers excitedly welcomed their beloved leader, Chairman Mao.

Chairman Mao, accompanied by Wang Renzhong, First Secretary of the Hubei Provincial Party Committee, Zhang Pinghua, Secretary of the Secretariat, and Song Kanfu, First Secretary of the Wuhan Municipal Party Committee, first entered the electromechanical industry and agricultural products exhibition hall. He started by looking at methane gas. When Chairman Mao saw that a match could light a methane gas lamp as bright as a sixty-watt electric lamp, he smiled happily. After carefully examining the methane gas lamp, Chairman Mao instructed, "This must be vigorously promoted."

Chairman Mao was very concerned about some minor inventions and creations. He saw the words "Wuhan First Creation" on the card of the "X-ray Transmission Film Box" and was very interested. He asked, "Is this a product of a handicraft cooperative?" The accompanying people told Chairman Mao that it was a product of the Fifth Hardware Production Cooperative. Chairman Mao approvingly said, "Very good!" Turning around, he looked at the improved agricultural tools produced by the handicraft cooperative: the five-use cultivator, the hand-pushed sprayer, the bamboo node dusting device, and the paddy field weeder. Chairman Mao picked up and repeatedly examined each of these simple in structure, highly effective, inexpensive, and practical agricultural tools.

Chairman Mao was very satisfied with the workers' creative spirit in overcoming difficulties, finding substitute raw materials, and improving accessories. New products made by various factories under the Municipal Supply and Marketing Cooperative using chicken feathers, waste batteries, scrap iron filings, waste mussel shells, waste rubber, and cattle and horse bones were praised by Chairman Mao. The air battery lamp made by Wuhan Battery Factory using peanut shells and cottonseed shells attracted Chairman Mao's attention. He inquired in detail about the manufacturing method and cost of this lamp. When he heard the explainer say that this lamp was safe, convenient, economical, and durable (costing only one cent per hour), Chairman Mao happily said, "This kind of lamp can be promoted."

Chairman Mao was also concerned about the cotton yarn woven from degummed wild fibers mixed with cotton by the textile industry hall, as well as the paint-coated cotton yarn window screen produced by the families of revolutionary martyrs factories as a substitute for iron gauze.

During the break, Wang Renzhong, Zhang Pinghua, and others told Chairman Mao, "Many of these new products were not invented and created by engineers and experts." Chairman Mao instructed, "We must encourage everyone to do it."

Outdoors, many large agricultural implements were displayed, such as small tractors, water pumps, plows, and harrows. Because it was dark, they could not be demonstrated to Chairman Mao. Chairman Mao happily watched the all-purpose tractor, and then watched the directional ladder fire truck manufactured by the Fire Machinery Factory. The designer of this vehicle personally operated and demonstrated it to Chairman Mao.

After about an hour, Chairman Mao left the exhibition. The staff of the entire hall bid farewell to Chairman Mao with a feeling of attachment. As soon as the car drove away, it became lively here. Some applauded, some shook hands and congratulated each other, and some gathered in groups of two or three to talk excitedly. They regarded this as the greatest happiness, and there was a happy laughter everywhere.

    毛主席关怀地方工业
    在武汉展览会上赞扬职工创造精神
    新华社武汉14日电　毛主席在武汉期间曾参观了武汉市地方工业产品展览会，并且赞扬了职工们的劳动和创造精神。
    4月11日傍晚，细雨蒙蒙，设在东湖畔的武汉市地方工业产品展览会，灯火辉煌。这里展出了武汉市地方工业职工在大跃进中的新创造和新产品。这天晚上，展览会的职工们兴奋万状地接待了自己敬爱领袖毛主席。
    毛主席由中共湖北省委第一书记王任重、书记处书记张平化、武汉市委第一书记宋侃夫等陪同，首先走进了机电工业和农产品展览馆，一开头就看沼气，当毛主席看到用火柴一点，沼气灯就像六十支光的电灯一样明亮时，他高兴地笑了。毛主席仔细地看了沼气灯之后，指示说：“这要好好地推广”。
    对一些细小的发明创造，毛主席都很关心。他看到“X光传片箱”卡片上面写着“武汉首创”的字样，很有兴趣，他问：“这是手工业合作社的产品吗？”陪同的人告诉毛主席这是第五五金生产合作社的产品。毛主席赞许地说：“很好！”转身来，又看了手工业合作社生产的改良农具——五用耕种器、手推喷雾车、竹节点头喷粉器和水田除草器等。对这些结构简单、效用高、价廉适用的农具，毛主席每一样都拿到手中反复地看了一下。
    毛主席很满意工人们克服困难寻找代用原材料和改进配件的创造精神。市供销社所属各厂利用鸡毛、废电池、废铁末、废蚌壳、废胶和牛马骨头等制成的新产品，得到毛主席的赞扬。武汉电池厂利用花生壳、棉子壳制成的空气电池灯，引起了毛主席的注意，他详细地询问了这种灯的制造方法、成本，当听到讲解员说这种灯既安全方便，又经济耐用（每小时只花一分钱），毛主席很高兴地说：“这种灯可以推广。”
    纺织工业馆利用野生纤维脱胶后与棉花混纺的棉纱织成的棉布，以及烈军属工厂生产的代替铁纱的棉纱漆窗布，毛主席都很关心。
    在休息时，王任重、张平化等告诉毛主席说：“这些新产品，有很多都不是由工程师和专家发明创造的。”毛主席指示说：“要鼓励大家干。”
    在室外，陈列了好多大件农具，如小型拖拉机、抽水机、犁、耙等。因为天黑了，不能表演给毛主席看。毛主席很高兴地看了万能拖拉机，接着又看了消防机器厂制造的方向云梯消防车，这个车的设计者并亲自操纵表演给毛主席看。
    约一小时后，毛主席离开了展览会，全馆的工作人员怀着依恋的心情送别了毛主席。汽车刚一开走，这里就热闹起来，有的鼓掌，有的互相握手道贺，有的二三成群地聚在一块兴奋地谈论，他们把这当作最大的幸福，到处都是一片愉快的笑声。
