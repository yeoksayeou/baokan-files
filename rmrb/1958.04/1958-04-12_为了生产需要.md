    For the Needs of Production
    China's agriculture is rapidly realizing farmland water conservancy and will gradually realize mechanized farming. Under these circumstances, if agricultural cooperatives are too small, many inconveniences will inevitably arise in the organization and development of production.
    In order to meet the needs of agricultural production and cultural revolution, it is necessary to plan and appropriately merge small agricultural cooperatives into large cooperatives in areas where conditions permit.
    The Lianxiang and Bingshe (Joint Township and Merged Cooperative) in Minhou County implementing mechanical irrigation and mechanical farming is a new measure taken to adapt to the new situation.
    Changing the organization of production, especially major changes such as Lianxiang and Bingshe, must pay attention to conditions and steps. The conditions for merging small cooperatives into large cooperatives should be: there is a need for developing production; the vast majority of members genuinely agree; the geographical conditions are suitable for the operation of large cooperatives; and the cooperative cadres are capable of running large cooperatives well.

    为了生产需要
    我国农业正在迅速地实现农田水利化，并将逐步实现耕作机械化。在这种情况下，农业合作社如果规模过小，在生产的组织和发展方面势将发生许多不便。
    为了适应农业生产和文化革命的需要，在有条件的地方，把小型的农业合作社有计划地适当地合并为大型的合作社是必要的。
    闽侯县联乡并社实行机械灌溉和机械耕作，就是适应新形势而采取的新措施。
    改变生产组织，特别是联乡并社这样较大的变动，一定要注意条件和步骤。小社合并为大社的条件应当是：在发展生产上有需要；绝大多数社员确实赞成；地理条件适合大社的经营；合作社的干部有能力办好大社。
