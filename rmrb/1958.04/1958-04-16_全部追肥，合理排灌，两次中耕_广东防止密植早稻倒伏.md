Apply All Topdressing Fertilizer, Reasonably Irrigate and Drain, Two Times of Mid-Cultivation

Guangdong Prevents Lodging of Densely Planted Early Rice

(Our dispatch) This year, Guangdong Province's field management of early rice is better than in previous years, achieving more fertilizer, better water conservancy, and densely planted rice seedlings. However, the densely planted rice fields are still very likely to face a serious risk of lodging due to sufficient fertilizer and dense planting. Therefore, how to achieve rational fertilization and rational water use for early rice in Guangdong, and how to make the field management of early rice technical, has become the most urgent task.

The technicalization of early rice field management first emphasizes preventing lodging. The methods are: First, all topdressing fertilizer is required within seven to ten days after transplanting. After transplanting, the seedlings take root and turn green in seven days, followed by effective tillering, and after another ten days, it will be ineffective tillering. Topdressing fertilizer seven to ten days after transplanting will catch up with effective tillering. In the past, many places applied topdressing fertilizer half a month after transplanting, often missing the effective tillering period and catching up with ineffective tillering. Too much ineffective tillering makes the rice head lush, increasing the burden on the rice; the rice roots cannot be ventilated, sunlight cannot reach them, the roots are weak, and they are prone to lodging. Second, rational irrigation and drainage are required. According to the growth, tillering, heading, and grain filling stages of early rice, irrigation should be scientifically controlled. Third, two times of mid-cultivation are required, eliminating the method of mid-cultivation by foot treading.

This is a major change in the habits and technology of early rice field management. Therefore, a large number of short-term training classes should be opened to teach simple techniques for rational water use and rational fertilization; the mass line method of on-site demonstration, on-site visits, and then immediate promotion should be adopted to fully mobilize the masses and let thousands of people work together.

(Our dispatch) Agricultural cooperatives in Panyu County, Guangdong Province, have established a system of management by local agronomists to institutionalize, technicalize, and standardize field management, raising the current field management work to a new level. As a result of the recent adoption of this measure, the seedlings in many of the 50,000 mu of backward fields in the county have turned green and become stronger.

This year, Panyu County has comprehensively implemented a series of technical reforms such as early transplanting and dense planting. However, the original field management systems of the agricultural cooperatives have failed to adapt to this need.

The Panyu County Party Committee recently summarized the successful experience of the Haixin and Shabei cooperatives in establishing an agronomist management system last year, and immediately promoted it in agricultural cooperatives throughout the county, bringing the county's field management work into a new stage. Last year, these two cooperatives selected a group of active members with production experience and a sense of responsibility from the members, and trained them as agronomists through short-term intensive training and learning by doing. Each agronomist has a fixed area of responsibility. In addition to contracting for the management of relatively technical tasks such as irrigation and drainage, controlling rice tillering, topdressing fertilizer, and using medicines and machinery to prevent and control plant diseases and insect pests, they also guide members in general field management techniques. As a result, the agricultural technology reform measures of these two cooperatives have been comprehensively implemented from beginning to end, achieving significant increases in production.

    全部追肥，合理排灌，两次中耕
    广东防止密植早稻倒伏
    本报讯　广东省今年早稻田间管理比起往年，已经做到肥料多，水利好，稻苗密植。但是，密植后的稻田还极有可能因为肥料充足和稻苗密植而发生严重的倒伏危险。因此，广东省早稻怎样做到合理用肥合理用水，做到早稻田间管理的技术化，便成为当前最迫切的任务。
    早稻田间管理技术化，首先强调防止倒伏。办法是：第一，要求插秧后七天到十天内全部追肥。插秧后，秧苗七天生根回青，接着是有效分蘖，再过十天后便是无效分蘖了。插秧后七天到十天追肥，便赶上有效分蘖。往年许多地方插秧半个月才追肥，往往误了有效分蘖期，赶上无效分蘖。无效分蘖太多，禾头枝叶茂密，加重禾的负担；禾根不能通风，阳光照射不到，根子脆弱，容易倒伏。第二，要求合理排灌。按照早稻生长、分蘖、结穗，结粒灌溉，科学地控制水的供应。第三，要中耕两次，取消脚踩的中耕方法。
    这是早稻田间管理习惯上技术上的一大变革。因此，应当大量开办短期训练班，传授简单的合理用水、合理用肥的技术；要采用现场示范、现场参观，然后立刻推广的群众路线的方法，充分发动群众，让千千万万人一齐动手。
    本报讯　广东省番禺县的农业社建立了土农艺师管理制度，做到田间管理工作制度化、技术化和规格化，使当前的田间管理工作提高到新的水平。由于最近采取这一措施的结果，全县五万亩落后田的禾苗，有许多已经回青转壮。
    今年春耕，番禺县全面实行了早插、密植一系列技术改革。但是，农业社原有的田间管理制度都未能适应这个需要。
    中共番禺县委会最近总结了海心社和沙北社去年建立农艺师管理制度的成功经验，立即在全县的农业社中推广，使全县的田间管理工作步入一个新的阶段。这两个社去年从社员中挑选出一批有生产经验和有责任心的积极分子，用短期集训和边做边学的方法培养为农艺师。每个农艺师都有固定的责任区。他们除了包干负责排灌、控制禾苗分蘖、追肥和药械防治病虫害等技术性较高的管理工作之外，还指导社员一般的田间管理技术。结果，这两个社的农业技术改革措施能自始至终全面贯彻执行，获得显著的增产。
