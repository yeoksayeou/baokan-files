Xinhua News Agency, Aden, April 21st: The British colonial authorities are intensifying their suppression of the national independence movement of the people in what they call the "Aden Protectorate" (southern Yemen). According to official announcements, the British government is transferring reserve troops from its colony of Kenya in Africa by air to Aden. The vanguard troops arrived in Aden on the 18th. At the same time, a cruiser and a fast ship of the British fleet in the Persian Gulf have also sailed to Aden, ready to take action at any time.

Prior to this, the British colonial authorities in Aden arrested Dulla Jiffri, a nationalist from the Lahj Sultanate in the "Western Aden Protectorate" and the educational administrator of the Sultanate, and are strictly searching for two other nationalists.

Xinhua News Agency, Cairo, April 21st: Ahmed Shami, Chargé d'Affaires of the Yemeni Embassy in Cairo, accused the British authorities on the 19th of repressive measures against the people of the so-called "Aden Protectorate" (southern Yemen). He said that the British authorities' arrest of Lahj nationalists is another crime committed by British imperialists in the occupied territories of Yemen.

Shami said that the repressive measures taken by Britain can only worsen the situation in the region. Lahj is a sultanate in the western part of what Britain calls the "Aden Protectorate." This area was originally part of Yemen.

Referring to the recent national movement in Lahj, Shami said that the people in the occupied territories of Yemen are determined to liberate themselves from imperialist rule and return to their motherland, Yemen. He said that they will never recognize any boundaries imposed by imperialism.

The "People's Daily" published an editorial on the 20th, strongly condemning Britain's dispatch of troops to Aden to suppress the local national movement, and accusing Britain of arresting Lahj nationalists. The newspaper said that the British expeditionary force will never be able to prevent the people, inspired by genuine patriotism, from completing their liberation struggle.

    英国残酷镇压亚丁人民
    也门驻开罗使节愤怒指责
    新华社21日讯　亚丁消息：英国殖民当局正在加紧镇压被它称为“亚丁保护地”（也门南部）的人民的民族独立运动。据官方宣布，英国政府正在从它在非洲的殖民地怯尼亚抽调后备部队空运到亚丁，先头部队已经在18日到达亚丁。同时，波斯湾英国舰队的一艘巡洋舰和一艘快速舰也已经开到亚丁，准备随时采取行动。
    在这以前，亚丁的英国殖民当局逮捕了“西部亚丁保护地”拉赫杰酋长国的一个民族主义者、这个酋长国的教育行政官杜拉·吉弗里，并且正在严密搜捕另外两个民族主义者。
    新华社开罗21日电　也门驻开罗公使馆临时代办艾哈迈德·沙米19日指责英国当局对所谓“亚丁保护地”（也门南部）人民采取的镇压措施。他说，英国当局逮捕拉赫杰民族主义者的行为是英帝国主义者在也门被侵占地区中犯下的又一个罪行。
    沙米说，英国采取的镇压措施只能使这个地区的局势恶化。拉赫杰是被英国称为“亚丁保护地”西部的一个酋长国。这个地区原是也门的一部分。
    沙米在谈到拉赫杰最近的民族运动情况时说，也门被侵占地区的人民决心从帝国主义统治下解放出来，归并到自己的祖国也门。他说，他们决不承认帝国主义所强加的任何边界。
    “人民报”20日发表社论，强烈谴责英国抽调军队到亚丁镇压当地民族运动的行为，并且指责英国逮捕拉赫杰的民族主义者。这家报纸说，英国的远征军决不可能阻止被真正的爱国主义鼓舞着的人民完成他们的解放斗争。
