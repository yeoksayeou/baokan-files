    Masses Run, Manage, and Support Themselves; Party Committee Strengthens Ideological Leadership
    Agricultural Middle Schools Take Root in Rural Areas
    Farmers in Shiqiao Township, Hanjiang County, praise the community-run middle school for having eight major benefits:
    1. The masses contribute money, no need for state investment; 2. Teaches agricultural technical knowledge; 3. Graduates from higher primary schools can continue their education; 4. Stabilizes rural youth; 5. Half-farming and half-studying reduces the burden on the masses; 6. Cultivates cadres for agricultural cooperatives; 7. Strengthens rural propaganda forces; 8. Strengthens rural literacy efforts.

    (Our reporter Wei Wenhua reports) Two agricultural middle schools have been established in Shiqiao Township, Hanjiang County, Jiangsu Province. They are completely run, managed, and supported by the masses themselves.

    Shiqiao Township has twenty-eight agricultural cooperatives, totaling 5,540 households and 21,000 people. The township has fourteen public and community-run primary schools and one public junior middle school. Due to the vast disparity between the number of primary and middle schools, graduates from higher primary schools have always found it very difficult to continue their education. This summer, there are 298 graduating students from higher primary schools in the township, and it is estimated that about two-thirds will not be able to continue their education. Therefore, students and parents alike eagerly hope to establish schools that are near their homes, cost little, and allow them to combine learning and production. In the midst of the great production drive, township and cooperative cadres are also increasingly eager to learn scientific and technical knowledge, hoping to have the opportunity to study.

    However, when the township proposed establishing agricultural middle schools in early March, many people doubted this new type of school, some even mocking it as "illegitimate from birth and short-lived." Cadres were also afraid of trouble, saying: "The central tasks are already heavy enough, we don't have time to run schools." Parents also had concerns, and only three students initially enrolled. In response to this situation, the township Party committee repeatedly publicized the benefits of mass-run schools for promoting cultural and educational undertakings and for production at more than thirty production meetings in the township and cooperatives, correcting the idea among cadres that they looked down on cultural and educational undertakings. At the same time, the township Party committee investigated the thoughts of 187 students and their parents throughout the township, held discussion meetings by region, and promoted the principles, teaching requirements, and training objectives of combining agricultural middle school studies with production.

    From preparation to establishment, these two agricultural middle schools have always allowed the masses to offer ideas and find solutions. The school site, academic system, student application requirements and admission standards, teaching content, fee collection methods, school management, etc., have all been repeatedly discussed by the masses. After the school was established, a school management committee composed of representatives from the Party, the Communist Youth League, agricultural cooperatives, and the masses was formed to regularly study the teaching situation. The school has truly achieved mass-run, mass-managed, and mass-supported status.

    After the school started, the township Party committee organized political teachers to compile political teaching materials based on Party policies and newspaper materials. Student organizations were established within the school to participate in school management. The two schools formulated student rules, including classroom learning and field labor, with reference to the regulations of ordinary middle schools and agricultural cooperatives, to stabilize school order and student morale. Teachers strengthened their studies and lesson preparation, listened to each other's classes, conducted collective research, and also held student discussion meetings to listen to students' opinions on teaching, identify problems, and make improvements at any time, striving to achieve three good things in teaching: good lesson preparation, good teaching, and good homework correction. The two schools also contacted public middle schools, sent teachers to listen to lectures at public schools, invited public school teachers to give demonstration lectures at agricultural middle schools, and borrowed reference materials from public schools.

    The most important issue for agricultural middle schools is how to combine teaching with production. The two schools stipulated the academic system according to the principle of more reading during slack seasons and rainy days, and less reading during busy seasons. Initially, the teaching of agricultural technology courses was not well integrated with practice and was too profound, leading to many opinions from the masses. The school immediately studied and improved after hearing the feedback. This year, the township is promoting the high-yield crop sweet potato in the drylands of the northern part of the township. The masses had no planting experience, fearing that they would not plant it well and that they would not be able to store it well after harvest. The First Agricultural Middle School used sweet potato specimens as teaching materials, lectured on sweet potato varieties, seedling cultivation, cultivation management, and storage techniques in the classroom, and taught students how to carry out seedling operations in the fields, and then transmitted the knowledge to the agricultural cooperatives through the students. Now, agricultural cooperatives throughout the township have decided to plant 1,300 mu of sweet potatoes. Recently, the two schools have also cooperated with the township to promote the conversion of indica rice to japonica rice, teaching the comparison between japonica and indica rice, the varieties of japonica rice, seedling raising, and cultivation management. Labor education for students has also been strengthened in teaching, and inspections are conducted at any time, and students' labor morale and labor efficiency have been improved.

    Agricultural middle schools have been warmly welcomed by the masses. Everyone says that agricultural middle schools have eight major benefits: 1. Mass-run schools, no need for state investment; 2. Schools teach agricultural technical knowledge, which is convenient for promoting advanced technology; 3. Rural higher primary school graduates continue their studies, and do not give up halfway; 4. Agricultural middle schools stabilize rural youth and no longer flow into the cities; 5. Half-farming and half-studying, schools are at the doorstep, and people with poor economic conditions can also go to school; 6. Agricultural cooperative cadres can be cultivated; 7. Schools teach politics, strengthening the township's propaganda forces; 8. Enhancing the township's literacy efforts.

    These two agricultural middle schools have a total of 162 students. Currently, the attendance rate for students in class and production is over 95%.

    群众自办自管自养　党委加强思想领导
    农业中学在农村扎根
    邗江县施桥乡农民赞美民办中学有八大好处：
    一、群众出钱，不需国家投资；二、传授农业技术知识；三、高小毕业生能继续升学；四、安定农村青年；五、半耕半读减轻群众负担；六、培养农业合作社干部；七、加强农村宣传力量；八、加强农村扫盲力量。
    本报讯　记者魏文华报道：江苏省邗江县施桥乡办起两所农业中学。完全由群众自办、自管、自养。
    施桥乡有二十八个农业社，计五千五百四十户，二万一千人。全乡有公办、民办小学十四所，公立初级中学一所。由于中小学比例太悬殊，历届高小毕业生都感到升学十分困难。今年暑假全乡高小应届毕业生二百九十八人，估计就约有三分之二不能升学。因此，学生和家长们都热望举办离家近、花费小、学习和生产两不误的学校。大生产中，乡、社干部对于学习科学技术知识的要求也愈来愈迫切，希望有学习的机会。
    但是，3月上旬乡里提出办农业中学时，不少人对这种新型学校怀疑，有的甚至讥讽它是“出胎不正，寿命不长”。干部也怕麻烦，说：“中心工作压得够重，没有时间办学校。”学生家长也有顾虑，开始时只有三人报名入学。针对这种情况，乡党委会在乡、社三十多次生产会议上反复宣传群众办学对于促进文教事业的发展和对于生产的好处，纠正了干部中轻视文教事业的思想。同时，乡党委调查了全乡一百八十七名学生和他们的家长的思想情况，分片召开座谈会，宣传有关农业中学学习和生产两结合的方针、教学要求和培养目的。
    这两所农业中学从筹备到成立，始终让群众来出主意，想办法。校址、学制、学生报考条件和录取标准、教学内容、收费办法、学校管理等，都经群众反复讨论。学校成立后又分别由党、团、农业社和群众代表等组成校务管理委员会，经常研究教学情况。学校真正做到了群众办，群众管，群众养。
    学校开学后，乡党委会组织政治教师，根据党的政策和报刊材料编写政治教材。学校内成立了学生组织，参加学校的管理。两校分别参照普通中学和农业社的规章制度订出包括课堂学习和田间劳动的学生守则，安定学校秩序和学生情绪。教师加强学习和备课，互相听课，集体研究，还召开学生座谈会，听取学生对教课意见，发现问题，随时改进，力求在教学方面做到三好：备课好，教课好，批改作业好。两校还分别和公立中学联系，派教师到公立学校听讲，请公立学校教师到农业中学作示范讲课，向公立学校借阅参考材料。
    农业中学最重要的一个问题是教学如何结合生产。两校按照农闲和雨天多读、忙季少读的原则，规定学制。农业技术课的教学，起初没有很好地结合实际，讲得太深，群众有不少意见，学校听到反映后立即研究改进。今年乡里北部旱地推广高产作物山芋，群众没有栽培经验，怕栽不好，又怕收了保管不好。第一农业中学就把山芋实物作教学材料，在课堂上讲山芋品种、育苗、栽培管理和贮藏等技术，在田间教学生进行育苗操作，并通过学生再向农业社传授。现在，全乡农业社已决定种植一千三百亩山芋。最近两校又配合乡里推广籼稻改粳稻，教学中讲粳、籼稻的对比，粳稻的品种、育秧、栽培管理等。教学中也加强对学生的劳动教育，并且随时进行检查，学生的劳动情绪和劳动效率都有所提高。
    农业中学受到了群众的热烈欢迎。大家都说农业中学有八大好处；一，群众办学，不需国家投资；二，学校教农业技术知识，便于推广先进技术；三，农村高小毕业生继续升学，不至半途而废；四，农业中学安定了农村青年，不再流入城市；五，半耕半读，学校在家门口，经济条件差的人也可以上学；六，可以培养农业社干部；七，学校教政治，加强乡里宣传力量；八，增强乡里扫盲力量。
    这两所农业中学共有学生一百六十二人。现在学生上课和生产出勤率，都在95％以上。
