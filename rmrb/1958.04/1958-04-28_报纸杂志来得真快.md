    Newspapers and Magazines Arrive So Quickly!
    In the past, magazines from Beijing would take at least a week to reach Qu County, Sichuan Province. I was so anxious that I went to the county post office to ask every day, but they always said they hadn't arrived. I remember last year when we saw Chairman Mao's poems published in the inaugural issue of "Poetry," we jumped for joy, hoping to read Chairman Mao's works as soon as possible. As a result, we went to the post office to buy "Poetry" a dozen or twenty times, and they always said it hadn't arrived.
    Now it's different! At 9:30 a.m. on April 10th, we read the fourth issue of "People's Literature," published in Beijing on April 8th. We know that this is the result of the great leap forward of the publishing house, transportation departments, and postal and telecommunications departments working together. We sincerely thank them. Speaking of the post office in Qu County, Sichuan Province, the postmen are also very energetic. As soon as the newspapers arrive, they deliver them immediately, whenever they arrive. For example, today we had just gotten out of bed when the postman brought the newspaper, and a total of four deliveries of newspapers, magazines, and letters were made in one day. It is very touching.

### 报纸杂志来得真快

    报纸杂志来得真快
    以往，北京的杂志到我们四川省渠县，最快的也得一星期，急得我天天到县里邮局去问，总说没来。记得去年我们在报上看到“诗刊”创刊号上登了毛主席的诗词，欢喜得跳起来，希望早天读到毛主席的作品；结果我们到邮局去买“诗刊”，跑了一二十回都说没有到。
    现在不同啦！4月10日上午九点半钟就读到了4月8日在北京出版的“人民文学”第四期。我们知道，这是出版社、交通运输部门和邮电部门一齐大跃进的结果。我们衷心感激他们。以我们四川省渠县的邮局来说，投递员的劲头也真大呀，只要报一到就立即送出来，什么时候到就什么时候送。像今天我们才起床，投递员同志就把报纸送来了，一天一共就送了四次报纸、杂志和信件。很使人感动。
