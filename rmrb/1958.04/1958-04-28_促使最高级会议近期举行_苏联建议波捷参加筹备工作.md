Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, 27th - TASS reported from Moscow: The Soviet government stated in a memorandum to the United States, British, and French governments on April 26 regarding the issue of convening a top-level meeting that, if the governments of the U.S., Britain, and France believe that an exchange of views should first be conducted through a joint meeting of their ambassadors to the Soviet Union with the Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs, then the Soviet government suggests that the ambassadors of Poland and Czechoslovakia should also participate in the joint meeting.

Soviet Foreign Minister Gromyko handed this memorandum to U.S. Ambassador Thompson, British Ambassador Reilly, and French Ambassador Dejean in Moscow on April 26. This memorandum is a response to the identical statements made by the United States, Britain, and France on the 16th and 24th.

The Soviet government's memorandum pointed out that the suggestion made in the U.S., British, and French statement on the 24th to hold a joint meeting of the three countries' ambassadors with the Soviet Foreign Minister to make necessary preparations for the Foreign Ministers' conference is unacceptable. This is because such a meeting would essentially be a four-nation conference, in which three countries are from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, while only one country is from the Warsaw Treaty Organization.

The memorandum said that the Soviet government still believes that the most reasonable way to conduct preliminary exchanges of views is through diplomatic channels, with the Soviet Foreign Minister holding separate talks with each country's ambassador. This is in line with the general practice of exchanging views through diplomatic channels in similar situations. However, if the three governments believe that it is better to exchange views through another diplomatic channel, namely a meeting of the three ambassadors in Moscow with the Soviet Foreign Minister, then in this case, the principle of equality, which serves as a fundamental principle, must be observed, just as when determining the members of the top-level meeting attended by heads of government, in order to eliminate any discrimination and ensure their equal rights.

The memorandum pointed out that it goes without saying that no issue can be resolved by voting or by a decision made by a formal majority at the top-level meeting or during the preparatory work for the meeting. In a meeting to exchange views in order to seek mutually acceptable resolutions, both sides should naturally have equal representation. Only in this way is it objective and reasonable.

The memorandum said that it can be seen from the U.S. government's statements on the 16th and 24th that the U.S. government has agreed to the Soviet Union's suggestion to begin exchanging views in Moscow on the preparations for the Foreign Ministers' conference. However, at the same time, after studying the aforementioned statements, one comes to the conclusion that the governments of the United States, Britain, and France are essentially indefinitely delaying the convening of the top-level meeting.

The Soviet government believes that it must be reminded that, although the Soviet Union proposed holding a high-level meeting more than four months ago, the governments of the United States, Britain, and France have still not responded to the issue of the meeting's preparations, namely the meeting's time, location, and participating members. No consensus has been reached on the scope of issues to be discussed at the meeting either.

The memorandum pointed out that, as everyone knows, the Soviet government has not only put forward specific proposals on the agenda of the high-level meeting and other issues related to convening the meeting, but has also accommodated the wishes of Western countries and agreed to conduct preparations for the meeting through diplomatic channels and a Foreign Ministers' conference.

The main task at present is how to most quickly complete the preparations for the high-level meeting, which would greatly improve the entire international situation. Therefore, the Soviet government reiterates the opinions put forward in the memorandum on the 11th on the issue of accelerating the preparations for the high-level meeting.

The Soviet government emphasized that, in exchanging views on preparing for the Foreign Ministers' conference through diplomatic channels, attention should be paid to ensuring that the exchange of views can focus on those issues that are directly related to organizing this conference, namely the time, location, and participating members of the Foreign Ministers' conference.

During the ambassador-level meetings and the Foreign Ministers' conference, if necessary and with everyone's consent, views may also be exchanged on certain issues that both sides suggest be included in the agenda of the high-level meeting, with the aim of clarifying whether it is appropriate to include these issues in the agenda of the high-level meeting and the possibility of reaching mutually acceptable decisions on these issues.

The Soviet government's memorandum concluded by pointing out that the Soviet government believes that the preparatory approach it has proposed will promote the holding of the top-level meeting in the near future. The Soviet government hopes that exchanging views through diplomatic channels will facilitate the quickest resolution of this task.

    促使最高级会议近期举行
    苏联建议波捷参加筹备工作
    新华社27日讯　据塔斯社莫斯科讯：苏联政府26日在给美国、英国和法国政府关于召开最高级会议问题的备忘录中说，如果美、英、法三国政府认为首先要通过他们三国驻苏联的大使与苏联外交部长举行的联席会议来交换意见的话，那么，苏联政府建议波兰和捷克斯洛伐克的大使也应该参加联席会议。
    苏联外交部长葛罗米柯26日在莫斯科把这份备忘录交给了美国大使汤普逊、英国大使赖利、法国大使德让。这份备忘录是对美国、英国和法国16日和24日的内容相同的声明的答复。
    苏联政府的备忘录指出，美国、英国和法国24日声明中所提出的由三国大使同苏联外交部长举行联席会议以进行外长会议必要的准备工作的建议，是不能接受的。因为这种会议实质上就是四国会议，其中三个国家是来自北大西洋联盟，而只有一个国家是来自华沙条约组织。
    备忘录说，苏联政府仍然认为，通过苏联外交部长同每个国家大使单独会谈的外交途径来初步交换意见是最合理的，因为这样做符合在类似情况下通过外交途径交换意见的一般惯例。但是，如果三国政府认为通过另一种外交途径，即三国大使在莫斯科同苏联外交部长举行会议的方法交换意见更好，那么，在这种情况下，必须像确定有政府首脑参加的最高级会议成员时一样，要遵守作为基本原则的均等原则，以消除任何歧视，保证他们的平等权利。
    备忘录指出，不言而喻，在最高级会议上或者在会议准备工作中，任何问题不能够用表决的方式、由形式的大多数通过决定的方式来解决。而在交换意见以谋求双方可以接受的决议的会议上，双方自然应该有同等的代表权，只有这样才是客观的、合理的做法。
    备忘录说，从美国政府16日和24日的声明中可以看出，美国政府已经同意苏联提出的关于开始在莫斯科就外长会议准备工作交换意见的建议。但与此同时，在研究了上述的声明以后使人得出一个结论：美国、英国和法国政府实质上是在使最高级会议的召开作无限期的拖延。
    苏联政府认为，必须提醒注意：虽然苏联提出举行高级会议的建议已经有四个多月了，但是美国、英国和法国政府仍然没有对会议的准备工作问题，即会议的时间、地点和参加会议的成员这些问题作出答复。对于会议应该讨论的问题的范围也没有取得一致。
    备忘录指出，大家知道，苏联政府不仅已经就高级会议的议程和有关召开会议的其他问题提出了具体的建议，而且也适应了西方国家的愿望，同意通过外交途径和外长会议来进行会议的筹备工作。
    目前主要的任务是如何最迅速地完成能使整个国际局势大为好转的高级会议的筹备工作。因此，苏联政府重申在11日的备忘录中就加速高级会议准备工作的问题提出的意见。
    苏联政府强调指出，在通过外交途径就准备外长会议问题交换意见这个问题上，应当注意使交换意见能够集中于那些直接关系到组织这次会议的问题，也就是外长会议的时间、地点和参加成员的问题。
    在大使级会议和外长会议期间，如果有必要并取得大家的同意，也可以就双方建议列入高级会议议程的某些问题交换意见，其目的是弄清这些列入高级会议的议程是否适宜以及就这些问题通过大家可以接受的决定的可能性。
    苏联政府的备忘录最后指出，苏联政府认为，它所提出的筹备途径能促使最高级会议在最近举行。苏联政府希望，通过外交途径交换意见将促使这项任务得到最快的解决。
