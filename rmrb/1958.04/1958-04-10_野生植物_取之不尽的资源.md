Wild plants growing all over China are valuable resources that can meet the needs of the people in terms of food, clothing, and other uses. More than a thousand important wild plants have been discovered so far, some of which can be used for oil extraction, some for fiber extraction, some for brewing wine, and some as raw materials for making baking adhesives.

More than four hundred kinds of wild oil plants that can be used for oil extraction have been discovered in various places. Sichuan Province alone has identified more than one hundred and thirty kinds. The ones that have been proven to have high oil content and large yields include cocklebur seeds, saltwort seeds, pepper seeds, and Chinese quince seeds. The Fourth National Grease Industry Conference decided that at least 30,000 tons of oil should be extracted from wild oil plants this year. Recently, the Second Commercial Department decided to purchase 300,000 tons of wild oil plants this year, an increase of eight times over last year, and strive to replace all industrial oil with oil made from wild oil plants within three to five years. Cocklebur, commonly known as "Cangzi," is produced all over the country, especially in North China, Northwest China, and Northeast China. Preliminary estimates indicate that the annual output of cocklebur in the country is about 30,000 tons, with an oil content of 17% to 21%. Saltwort, scientifically known as Suaeda salsa, has an oil content of generally 23% to 28%, and is produced in Jiangsu, Shandong, Hebei, Liaoning, and other places. Pepper seeds are mainly produced in Hebei, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Shandong, and other places, with an estimated annual output of about 2,500 tons and an oil content of 25% to 30%. The kernel of Chinese quince seeds produced in some mountainous areas of Longdong and Longnan in Gansu has an oil content as high as 46.7%. In addition to being used as industrial raw materials for making paint, ink, soap, coatings, and other products, wild oil plants can also be used to fertilize fields, and some can also be used as feed.

Wild fiber resources for textile and paper-making are even more abundant, with more than three hundred types discovered that can be utilized. As early as 1953, the Shanghai textile industry used wild Apocynum venetum (commonly known as "wild hemp") from the Northwest grasslands and mixed it with wool to weave high-grade textiles such as gabardine and valitin. The degummed Apocynum venetum fiber has a fineness equivalent to 80-count fine wool, and a tensile strength six to seven times that of cotton fiber. Recently, the Chongqing textile industry has used a large number of wild plant fibers to trial-produce more than one hundred kinds of textiles. These include fine yarns spun from wild hemp such as Boehmeria nivea, ramie, and hemp. The Southwest First Silk Spinning Factory spun Boehmeria nivea into 80-count high-grade yarn, which can be woven into high-grade linen yarn. Sichuan has decided to build 38 artificial cotton processing plants, which will produce 2.5 million dan of artificial cotton from the stems of wild plants without using an acre of land, equivalent to the output of 8 million mu of cotton fields. The Zunyi Artificial Cotton Factory in Guizhou used manual operation to successfully trial-produce artificial cotton from eighteen kinds of fiber-containing plants.

Wild starch plants, wild fruits, and other wild plants that can be used for industrial purposes are also abundant. Six state-owned cotton textile factories in Tianjin have decided to gradually replace flour for sizing yarn with wild plant Lycoris radiata powder. Preliminary calculations show that more than 1,800 tons of flour can be saved annually. Lycoris radiata is produced all over the country, with the most abundant production in the provinces south of the Yangtze River. There are also many raw materials all over the country that can be used to replace dried melon and grains for brewing wine, such as black dates, wild grapes, and Chinese hawthorn. The First Quarter Tobacco and Alcohol Supply Conference of the former Urban Service Department decided to develop 100,000 tons of substitute brewing this year. According to preliminary estimates, the annual output of acorns alone, a kind of wild plant, is about 2.7 billion jin nationwide. If fully utilized, it can brew 450,000 tons of white wine, saving 1.8 billion jin of grain.

Various places have also discovered many new wild plants that can be used as important industrial raw materials. In 1956, Henan found a large number of raw materials for manufacturing baking adhesives in the Dabie Mountains, including several kinds such as Halesia macgregorii, red root, oak shells, and Quercus dentata. Recently, a large number of wild Cryptostegia grandiflora have been discovered in Yangbi, Fengyi, Yongjian, and other places in Yunnan, with a rubber content as high as 83.2%. Moreover, this plant has a long life and reproduces quickly, and can be tapped for rubber five years after cuttings. More than 500,000 mu of mangroves with high tannin content were discovered in Guangdong two years ago, and this year, the Tianjin First People's Paper Mill successfully trial-produced high-grade kraft paper using mangrove bark. Sheep hoof vines with about 40% tannic acid content have also been discovered in Hainan Island and the Leizhou Peninsula. China also possesses aromatic plant raw materials of high economic value. The total output of tropical shrub Litsea cubeba in the provinces south of the Yangtze River is about 10,000 tons, which can be used to extract fragrant oil and citral.

Many medicinal material resources in mountainous areas throughout the country have not yet been discovered and utilized. Among the more than 200 kinds of new medicinal materials discovered in Yunnan, Guangxi, Henan, and other nine provinces, Terminalia chebula, Dalbergia odorifera, and other kinds used to be imported, but now they can not only be self-sufficient, but also exported. After recent two years of investigation, the Longnan mountainous area has been found to be an important medicinal material treasure house in China. For example, the quality and quantity of Astragalus propinquus produced there are the best in the country. (Xinhua News Agency)

### 野生植物——取之不尽的资源

    野生植物——取之不尽的资源
    我国漫山遍野生长着的野生植物，有许多是可以用来满足人民吃、穿、用等方面需要的可贵的资源。目前已发现的重要野生植物有一千多种，其中有的可以榨油，有的可以提取纤维，有的可以酿酒，有的可以作为制烤胶的原料。
    各地发现可供榨油的野生油料植物已达四百多种，四川一个省就查明有一百三十多种。已经证明含油较多、产量也较大的，有苍耳子、盐蒿子、花椒子、木瓜子等。全国第四次油脂工业会议决定今年至少用野生油料榨油三万吨。最近第二商业部决定今年采购野生油料三十万吨，比去年增加八倍，争取在三年到五年内，工业用油全部由野生油料所制的油代替。苍耳子通称苍子，产地遍全国，尤以华北、西北、东北等地为最多，初步估计，全国年产苍子约三万吨，含油量为17％到21％。盐蒿子学名碱蓬，含油量一般为23％到28％，江苏、山东、河北、辽宁等地都有出产。花椒子在河北、山西、陕西、山东等地出产较多，估计全国年产量在二千五百吨左右，含油量25％到30％。甘肃陇东、陇南一些山区出产的木瓜子仁含油率高达46.7％。野生油料除供制作油漆、油墨、肥皂、涂料等工业原料用油外，子饼还可以肥田，有一部分还可以作饲料。
    供纺织、造纸用的野生纤维资源更为丰富，已发现有三百多种可以利用。早在1953年，上海纺织工业部门就用西北草原上野生的罗布麻（通称野麻）和羊毛混合纺织成华达呢、凡立丁等高级纺织品。脱胶后的罗布麻纤维，细度相当于八十支的细羊毛，拉力等于棉纤维的六倍到七倍。最近，重庆纺织工业大量使用野生植物纤维试制成一百多种纺织品。其中包括用取麻、水麻、大麻等野生麻纺成的细纱。西南第一丝纺厂把取麻纺成了八十支高级纱，可以织成高级麻纱。四川已决定筹建三十八个人造棉加工厂，不用一亩地，要从野生植物的茎秆中制造出二百五十万担人造棉，相当于八百万亩棉田的产量。贵州遵义人造棉厂用手工操作，把十八种含有纤维的植物，试制成功人造棉。
    野生淀粉植物、野生水果以及可供工业用的其他野生植物，资源也很丰富。天津六个国营棉纺织厂已决定逐步使野生植物石蒜粉代替面粉浆纱，初步计算，全年可节约面粉一千八百多吨左右。石蒜各地都有出产，江南各省出产最多。全国各地可以代替瓜干和粮食酿酒的原料也很多，如黑枣、山葡萄、山红果等都可以酿酒。原城市服务部第一季烟酒供应会议上曾决定今年发展十万吨代用品酿酒。仅橡子一种野生植物，据初步估计，全国年产约二十七亿斤，如果全部利用，可以酿白酒四十五万吨，能节约粮食十八亿斤。
    各地还发现了不少新的可作重要工业原料的野生植物。1956年，河南在大别山区找到了大批制造烤胶的原料，有化香、红根、橡壳子、檞树等好几种。最近云南漾濞、凤仪、永建等地发现了大量野生的鹿角藤，所含橡胶高达83.2％，而且这种植物寿命长、繁殖快，插条后五年即可割胶。含单宁量很高的红树，前年在广东发现了五十多万亩，今年天津第一人民造纸厂用红树皮试制高级牛皮纸成功。在海南岛和雷州半岛一带也发现了含单宁酸约40％的羊蹄藤。我国还拥有经济价值很高的芳香植物原料。热带灌木山苍子，江南各省总产量约有一万吨，可以提炼香料油、柠檬醛。
    全国各地山区的药材资源没有被发现和被利用的还很多。云南、广西、河南等九省发现的二百多种新药材中，柯子、降香等几种过去都是靠进口的，现在不仅能自给，还可以出口。陇南山区经过最近两年的调查，发现是我国重要的药材宝库，如所产红芪的质量、数量都是全国第一。　　（新华社）
