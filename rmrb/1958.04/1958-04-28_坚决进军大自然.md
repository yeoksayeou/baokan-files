Clack the bamboo clappers, tightly connected,
A happy event arrives in Wen'an,
To greatly change Wen'an,
Resolutely march into nature.

Granny Wang, Old Man Zhang,
Their eyes are smiling into slits,
And the suffering Lao Erhei,
Is moved to tears.

Hoping this year, hoping next year,
Hoping the iron tree blooms.
Talking about Wen'an, speaking of Wen'an,
Nine out of ten years are lean,
Even if we have a bumper year,
The poor still have difficulty eating their fill.

Selling sons and daughters, fleeing to other places,
The whole family is separated,
Starvation deaths are common,
This blood debt cannot be reckoned.

The Communist Party has foresight,
The life-saving benefactor arrives in Wen'an,
Implementing unified purchase and sales,
Even in famine years, we can eat our fill.

Not a single person has starved to death,
Ironclad facts speak louder than eloquence.
With production and frugality,
Living standards have generally improved,
Material life has improved,
And the cultural upsurge is widespread.

Elementary schools are rebuilt and expanded,
Three middle schools are also well-established,
Right-wing elements, don't talk nonsense,
Open your eyes and take a look.

In 1958, great construction,
The face of Wen'an will be completely changed,
Digging ditches, building embankments,
The river water will obey people's commands.

Building water conservancy, to generate electricity,
And many pumping stations,
A thousand catties per mu will definitely be realized,
People's lives will be full of joy.

(This was jointly compiled by an old man in his sixties and an eighteen-year-old youth from the Sihe Village Agricultural Cooperative in Wen'an County.)

    坚决进军大自然
    （河北文安新山歌）打竹板，紧相连，一件喜事到文安，要把文安大改变，坚决进军大自然。王大娘，张老汉，眼睛乐成一条线，还有受苦的老二黑，感动的眼泪流满面。今年盻，明年盻，盻的铁树开了瓣。说文安，道文安，十年倒有九年歉，即便过个丰收年，穷人也难吃饱饭。卖儿女，逃外边，一家老少闹失散，饿死人事常常见，这笔血债没法算。共产党，有远见，救命恩人到文安，实行统购与统销，荒年也能吃饱饭。没有饿死一个人，铁的事实胜雄辩。随着生产与节约，生活普遍有改善，物质生活提高了，文化高潮也普遍。小学改建又扩建，中学三处也健全，右派分子别胡言，睁开眼睛看一看。五八年，大修建，文安面貌全改变，挖沟渠，筑堤岸，河水听从人使唤。修水利，来发电，又有好多扬水站，亩产千斤定实现，人民生活乐无边。
