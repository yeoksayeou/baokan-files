Building a New Tibet by Following the Socialist Road
Speech by the Chairman of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the Dalai Lama

    At this symposium celebrating the second anniversary of the official establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, we congratulate this glorious festival with immense joy.

    Under the correct leadership of the Chinese Communist Party and Chairman Mao, and the direct leadership of the CCP Tibet Work Committee, the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, based on the spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift and the central government's policy of not carrying out democratic reforms in Tibet during the Second Five-Year Plan, reorganized and streamlined the institutions under the Preparatory Committee in 1957, correspondingly reduced the number of staff, and exempted Tibetan cadres and trainees participating in state organs from the "corvée tax." In order to strengthen the rational development of transportation in the Tibet region and maintain local public security, the management of private cars and various vehicles was carried out, and some things beneficial to the broad masses of monks, nuns, and lay people were done, and certain achievements were made.

    In 1958, the Preparatory Committee organized cadres to study politics, policies, and current affairs to improve their political and ideological level and work efficiency. In accordance with the spirit of building the country through diligence and thrift, administrative expenses were well managed, and expenditures were saved. According to the instructions of the State Council, the inflow of foreign goods was strictly managed. In addition, in order to develop the culture of the Tibetan people, efforts were made to ensure that the teaching quality of Lhasa middle and primary schools and schools in various places reached standard levels based on existing capabilities. At present, the Preparatory Committee is doing some beneficial things for the broad masses of the people in Tibet, and should continue to work hard for greater achievements in the future.

    All cadres of the Preparatory Committee should further strengthen their study, further improve their ideological level, and gradually accumulate work experience based on the learning and work experience gained in the past two years. They should learn from the advanced examples of fraternal ethnic groups, led by the Han nationality. Not only should they strive for progress, but they should also overcome the tendency of local nationalism and all words and deeds that hinder the prosperity of the Tibetan nationality. Strengthen the unity of all fraternal ethnic groups in the country, resolutely oppose imperialist elements and separatist elements, and work together to ensure the early formal establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region.

    It is certain that we must change the backwardness of Tibet in politics, economy, culture, and other aspects, make Tibet increasingly prosperous and happy, and take the socialist road. This is our common path. The central government's policy of not carrying out democratic reforms during the Second Five-Year Plan is correct and in line with the current specific situation in Tibet. During this period, everyone should study hard and must earnestly prepare ideologically for democratic reforms. In order to realize the central government's policy of peaceful democratic reform from top to bottom, we must take active measures, which is a major responsibility that we should shoulder. Therefore, all Tibetan, Hui, and Han cadres should stand firmly on the Party's position, and the broad masses of monks, nuns, and lay people in Tibet should contribute all their strength, under the banner of patriotism, unity, and progress, and work together along the socialist road to build a new Tibet with prosperous politics and religion.

    走社会主义道路建设新西藏
    西藏自治区筹委会主任委员达赖喇嘛的讲话
    在这庆祝西藏自治区筹备委员会正式成立两周年的座谈会上，我们怀着无比愉快的心情祝贺这一光辉的节日。
    在中国共产党和毛主席的正确领导下，在中共西藏工委的直接领导下，西藏自治区筹备委员会根据勤俭建国的精神及中央确定西藏地区在第二个五年计划期间不进行民主改革的方针，在1957年内筹委会所属机关作了整编精简，相应地减少了一部分工作人员，免去了参加国家机关工作的藏族干部及学员的“人役税”。为了加强西藏地区交通运输力量的合理发展，维护地方治安起见，对私人汽车及各种车辆进行了管理，并办了一些对广大僧俗人民有利的事情，同时取得了一定的成绩。
    在1958年，组织了筹委会所属干部学习政治、政策、时事，来提高干部的政治思想水平和工作效率。根据勤俭建国的精神，管理好行政费用，节约开支；按照国务院的指示，严格管理外货内流。此外，为了发展西藏人民的文化，根据现有力量尽量使拉萨中、小学和各地学校的教学质量达到标准水平。目前，筹委会正在为西藏广大人民举办一些有好处的事情，今后仍应为争取更大的成绩而继续努力。
    筹委会的所有干部，应该在过去两年中所取得的学习和工作经验的基础上，进一步加强学习，进一步提高思想水平，逐步积累工作经验，在以汉族为首的兄弟民族的帮助下，学习他们的先进榜样。不仅要力求进步，而且还要克服地方民族主义的倾向及妨碍西藏民族繁荣的各种言行。加强全国各兄弟民族的团结，坚决反对帝国主义分子和分离主义分子，为使西藏自治区早日正式成立而共同努力。
    改变西藏政治、经济、文化等各方面的落后面貌，使西藏日益繁荣幸福，走社会主义的道路是肯定的，它是我们共同的道路。中央确定在第二个五年计划期间，不进行民主改革的方针，这是正确而符合目前西藏具体情况的。在这个期间，大家应努力学习，必须认真作好民主改革的思想准备工作。为了实现中央确定的自上而下的和平民主改革方针，我们必需采取积极措施，这是我们应负的重大责任。因此，全体藏、回、汉族干部应当站稳党的立场，我们西藏广大僧俗人民应当贡献出自己所有的力量，在爱国团结进步的旗帜下，沿着社会主义的道路，为建设政教昌隆的新西藏而共同努力奋斗。
