The opening ceremony was presided over by Anna Toma, head of the Romanian government delegation, who also delivered the opening address. She said that holding the Romanian Economic Exhibition in Beijing, China, is a major event in our country's economy and is very important to us. This is the first time such a large exhibition has been held in our country. Our aim is to introduce some of the most significant achievements of the Romanian People's Republic to the Chinese people through it. She then talked about the achievements of Romania's socialist construction and the friendly cooperation between China and Romania. She said that friendly cooperative relations are of great help to the socialist construction of both countries. Our success, just like your success, is a victory for the entire socialist camp and a victory for all forces of peace and progress. We hope that the exhibition opening today will help you better understand our economic construction. In her speech, she also wished the Chinese people greater success in socialist construction and in the struggle for lasting world peace. She said that the Romanian people firmly believe that the great fraternal Chinese people will surely be able to catch up with the industrial level of Great Britain within fifteen years.

Minister of Foreign Trade Ye Jizhuang delivered a congratulatory speech. He first congratulated the successful opening of the Romanian Economic Exhibition in Beijing. He said that just as our country is in the first year of its Second Five-Year Plan, and the Chinese people are building socialism with unprecedented confidence and firm steps, according to the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical results, going all out, aiming high, and striving for the upper reaches; and just as China and Romania are preparing to discuss and sign a long-term trade agreement, the Romanian Economic Exhibition has exhibited a rich and colorful variety of highly technical exhibits, allowing us to see the brilliant achievements Romania has made in socialist economic construction, and giving us the opportunity to learn Romania's advanced scientific and technological knowledge and construction experience. This will play a significant encouraging and supportive role in our socialist construction. Ye Jizhuang also said that the exhibition of the Romanian Economic Exhibition will leave a glorious page in the historical path of Sino-Romanian economic and trade cooperation. I firmly believe that this will not only further strengthen the friendly cooperation between our two peoples, but will also help consolidate the great unity of socialist countries headed by the Soviet Union.
