Xinhua News Agency, Chengdu, April 4th: The nation's first wild fiber factory was recently completed and put into production in Santai County, Sichuan Province.

    This factory uses locally produced cotton stalk hemp, *suosuo* grass (*Lophatherum gracile*), rice straw, banana, and paper mulberry bark as raw materials to process and manufacture wild fibers. The main raw materials are cotton stalk hemp and *suosuo* grass. The wild fiber produced from these raw materials is of sufficient length, good color, strong tensile strength, delicate and soft, and inexpensive. The more than twenty kinds of items, such as cloth, towels, blankets, socks, and mosquito net cloth, woven by local handicraft cooperatives are difficult for people to distinguish from cotton textiles.

    The Santai County Wild Fiber Factory currently has more than sixty workers, who are engaged in production in six workshops, including material cutting, steaming, and soap fermentation. The entire production process is manual, and the technology is relatively simple. Currently, the factory produces 300 *jin* of finished wild fiber products per day. In the future, some of the operating processes will gradually be changed to use small machines.

    From the start of preparations to putting it into production, the factory took only half a month and cost more than 4,000 yuan in construction funds. The factory site is an old building that was utilized. Except for the production tools, all other utensils were borrowed from other units.

    全国第一座野生纤维工厂在三台建成
    据新华社成都4日电　全国第一座野生纤维工厂最近在四川省三台县建成，并投入生产。
    这座工厂利用当地出产的棉秆麻、蓑草（龙须草）、稻草、芭蕉和构树皮为原料，加工制造野生纤维。其中主要原料是棉秆麻和蓑草两种。用这些原料加工制造出来的野生纤维，长度够，色泽好，拉力强，细致柔软，价钱便宜。经过当地手工业社纺织成的布匹、毛巾、毯子、袜子和蚊帐布等二十多种物品，人们很难看出它同棉织品有什么区别。
    三台县野生纤维工厂现有工人六十多人，分别在铡料、蒸煮、皂酵等六个车间里进行生产。生产过程全部是手工操作，技术比较简单。目前，这个厂每天生产野生纤维成品三百斤。今后，一部分操作过程将逐步改为使用小型机器。
    这个厂从动手筹备到投入生产，只用了半个月时间，建设资金四千多元。厂址是利用的一座旧房子。除了生产工具以外，其余用具都是从其他单位借来的。
