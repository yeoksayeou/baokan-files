During the upsurge of the socialist Great Leap Forward, many factories, agricultural cooperatives, government offices, and schools organized youth shock brigades, some established youth supervision posts, and others formed youth guards. Although the names differ, their enthusiasm is the same. They truly are a vibrant young generation.

These young people dare to offer sharp criticism to comrades, dare to challenge old traditions, dare to think independently, and even more dare to raise fresh questions. Their suggestions to leaders and teachers are both sincere and enthusiastic. They lay out all the problems without any reservations, but they also pay attention to propriety, able to startle those being criticized and make them determined to change.

Recently, I saw many big-character posters written by young people in some universities, which fully demonstrated the spirit of adhering to principles of "I love my teacher, but I love truth more." For example, they pointed out "the phenomenon of certain professors abstractly negating and concretely praising some bourgeois scholars, ‘criticizing’ them verbally but admiring them emotionally." Students raised this question because some bourgeois scholars have consistently cursed the Communist Party and opposed Marxism. This kind of exposure is entirely necessary, and this kind of criticism is righteous and stern.

These young people believe in the truth of Marxism and firmly stand on the position of the working class, even though they may be far less knowledgeable and learned than those they criticize. But they have a clear sense of direction, so they dare to speak and dare to act, with a hundred times the courage, advancing bravely. They never look left and right, nor hesitate, and even less do they have the slavish spirit of kowtowing to old antiques.

From the irresistible and magnificent spirit of today's youth, one cannot help but think of some achievements of young people in ancient times. Throughout history, both in China and abroad, there have been many great scholars and inventors who created achievements when they were still lacking in knowledge. The People's Daily editorial on April 10, "Emit the Light and Heat of Youth!" mentioned Marx and Sun Yat-sen. Confucius became famous in his early thirties; Li Shimin launched an uprising at the age of nineteen; Luo Cheng became a commander at the age of nineteen; Sakyamuni also "attained enlightenment" in his youth; Dobrolyubov lived in the world for only twenty-five years, but at the age of thirteen or fourteen, he read 410 books in a year, and he always pondered deeply every book he read, without resting at all. He said, "I will not admit defeat to fate without a fight." These people were so young, yet they did so many things, and established their own banners in the ideological front!

And they were all courageous in thinking, daring to dream, daring to act, and daring to do, so even if they were young and immature, they could still achieve great things. The saying "great talents mature late" is certainly reasonable; as people mature, their achievements will naturally be greater, but as they get older, they also tend to be overly cautious, not daring to cross the line. Therefore, in practice, there are still many young lads who achieve great things; the saying "young and inexperienced" is not entirely true. "The younger generation is to be held in awe" is correct. However, we should now also say that the younger generation is not to be held in awe, but is admirable.

Youth are the successors of the communist cause and should also be the shock troops of the storm. They must become staunch defenders of Marxism, and their innovations will push society further forward.

    后生可爱
    刘丰
    在社会主义大跃进的高潮中，好多工厂、农业社、机关、学校的青年都组织了青年突击队，有的设立了青年监督岗，有的建立了青年近卫军，名称虽然不一，干劲可都一样。真不愧为朝气蓬勃的年轻一代。
    这些青年敢于对同志提出尖锐的批评，敢于向旧传统挑战，也敢于独立思考，更敢于提出新鲜的问题。他们对领导、老师所提的意见既恳切又热情，该谈的问题都摊了出来，没有任何保留，可也注意到分寸，能达到使被批评者大吃一惊，立下非改不可的决心。
    最近在一些大学里看到不少青年所写的大字报，就充分表现出那种“吾爱吾师，吾更爱真理”的坚持原则的精神。例如他们指出“某些教授对有些资产阶级学者抽象的否定、具体的赞扬，口头上‘批判’、感情上崇拜的现象”。同学这样的提出问题，是因为有些资产阶级学者是一直咒骂共产党反对马克思主义的。这种揭露是完全必要的，这种批评也是义正词严的。
    这些青年相信马克思主义真理，站稳了工人阶级的立场，虽然他们在知识上、学问上也许比被他们批评的人差的多。可是他们看清了方向，就敢说敢做，勇气百倍，一往直前。他们绝不左顾右盼，也不瞻前顾后，更没有向老古董低三下四卑躬屈节的奴隶精神。
    从今天青年势如破竹、气壮山河的气概，不由使人想到古代青年的一些成就。古今中外很有一些大学者、大发明家，都是在学问不足的时候就创造了业绩。4月10日人民日报社论“发出青春的光和热！”中提到了马克思和孙中山。孔子在三十出头时就已成名；李世民十九岁就起义；罗成在十九岁时就当了司令；释迦牟尼也是在年青时“得道”的；杜勃罗留波夫生活在世界上仅仅二十五个年头，可是他在十三、四岁的时候，一年就读了四百一十种书，他每读一本书总要苦苦思索，一点不休息。他说：“不经过搏斗我是不肯向命运认输的。”这些人那样年轻，就做了许多的事，在思想阵地上树立了自己的旗帜！
    而他们又都是勇于思索，敢于幻想，敢做，敢为的，所以即使年轻，不成熟，也能大有成就。“大器晚成”这话固然合情近理，人成熟了，成就自然更大些，可是年纪大了也就容易过分谨慎，不敢越雷池一步。所以在实际中毛头小伙子，干出一番大事业出来的也毕竟不少，“少不经事”的话也不尽全对。“后生可畏”倒是对的。但是，我们现在还应该说，后生不是可畏，而是可爱。
    青年是共产主义事业的接班人，也应该是风暴的突击手，他们必须成为马克思主义的悍卫者，他们的创见也会把社会推向更前。
