    Eliminating the Four Pests Should Not Be a Burden
    In the movement to eliminate the four pests, some people see it as a burden. Currently, in some areas, there is a phenomenon of using money or goods to exchange for rats or sparrows from farmers to complete the task. Around our cooperative, there are individual cadres from some organizations who use a pack of cigarettes or a steamed bun to exchange for a rat from a farmer; some cadres bought rat traps and placed them in farmers' homes, asking the farmers to trap rats for them, and if they caught a rat, they would be given a certain reward.
    Why is this happening? I think there are two reasons: one is that these units have not done enough publicity work on eliminating the four pests; the other is that there is a phenomenon of compulsory task assignment, so some cadres see eliminating the four pests as a burden. In order to overcome this phenomenon, I suggest that relevant units should conduct inspections and strengthen education for cadres.

    Do Not Damage Crops While Eliminating the Four Pests
    Some things that should not have happened have occurred in the movement to eliminate the four pests. Recently, I discovered that on both sides of the highway in Shibu Prefecture, Fuzhou City, several field ridges and haystacks were messed up by some units digging for rats. Also, once, I saw several comrades from a certain unit digging rat holes by the roadside. Suddenly, a rat ran into the wheat field, and these comrades stepped into the wheat field to look for the rat. After a while, they caught the rat, but the robust wheat seedlings were damaged a lot. I think this kind of behavior of ruining crops should be stopped.　Shi Qiushui

    除四害不应当是负担
    在除四害运动中，有人把它看作是一种负担。目前在一些地区出现了拿钱或拿东西向农民换取老鼠或麻雀来完成任务的现象。在我们合作社周围就有个别机关的干部，用一盒香烟或一个馒头向农民换一只老鼠；有的干部买了个老鼠夹放在农民家里，叫农民代打，如果打到老鼠就给以一定的报酬。
    为什么会出现这种情况呢？我认为有两个原因：一个是这些单位对除四害的宣传工作还做得不够；一个是有强迫摊派任务的现象，因而有些干部就把除四害看成是一种负担。为了克服这种现象，我建议有关单位应该进行检查，并加强对干部的教育。

    除四害不要损害庄稼
    在除四害运动中出现了一些不应该有的事情。最近，我就发现福州市施埔一州的公路两旁，有好几处田畔和草堆由于有些单位去掘捕老鼠被弄得乱七八糟。还有一次，我看到某单位的几个同志在公路旁挖鼠洞，突然一只老鼠跑到麦田里，这几个同志便踩进麦田里寻找老鼠，过了好一会才抓到老鼠，但是茁壮的麦苗却被损伤了不少。我认为，这种糟踏农作物的行为应该制止。　施秋水
