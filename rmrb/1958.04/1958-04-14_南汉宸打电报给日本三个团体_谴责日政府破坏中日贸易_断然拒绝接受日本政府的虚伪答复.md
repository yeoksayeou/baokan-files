Xinhua News Agency, April 13th. Nan Hanchen, Chairman of the China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, today sent a telegram to three Japanese organizations, condemning the Japanese government for deliberately sabotaging the implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. Nan Hanchen also stated that the Chinese side resolutely refuses to accept the Japanese government's reply regarding the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. The full text of the telegram is as follows:

To:
Mr. Masanosuke Ikeda, Representative Director, League of Diet Members Promoting Japan-China Trade
Mr. Kumaichi Yamamoto, President, Japan International Trade Promotion Association
Mr. Saburo Nango, Chairman, Japan-China Import and Export Association

    Your telegram of the 9th has been received.
    We have studied the Japanese government's reply regarding the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. This reply shows that the Japanese government not only fails to provide any necessary and clear guarantee for the implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, but also deliberately sabotages it. We resolutely reject this reply, and the original text of the reply sent by airmail will be returned unopened.
    Although the Japanese government's reply is as vague as possible, it cannot conceal its intention to overturn the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. The statement made by Aiichiro Fujiyama on April 9 on behalf of the Japanese government makes this intention even more obvious.
    (1) The Japanese government claims in its reply that it will respect the spirit of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. Aiichiro Fujiyama also said in his statement that the Japanese government "intends to respect the spirit of seeking to expand trade between the two sides." Let us see what kind of "spirit" the Japanese government actually respects. The most important spirit of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement is friendship, and it is to strengthen the friendship between the people of China and Japan through the development of Sino-Japanese trade. However, Aiichiro Fujiyama emphasized in his statement that the Japanese government has no intention of recognizing the People's Republic of China and that the Japanese government will respect its relations with the Chiang Kai-shek clique in Taiwan. This is resolutely hostile to the 600 million Chinese people, and there is no talk of any spirit of friendship. The Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and the memorandum, which is an integral part of this agreement, are permeated with the spirit of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect. However, Aiichiro Fujiyama's statement shows that the Japanese government is prepared to use the excuse of not recognizing our commercial representative offices as "having official privileged status" to make the various provisions made by both sides in the memorandum based on the principle of reciprocity inapplicable to us. Aiichiro Fujiyama even openly stated that the Japanese government does not recognize the right of our commercial representative offices to fly their national flag. This unilaterally tears up the agreement and has nothing in common with the spirit of equality, mutual benefit, and mutual respect. Since it is resolutely hostile to the Chinese people and does not abide by the principle of equality and mutual benefit, then what else can the Japanese government's so-called "expanding trade" mean other than attempting to carry out unequal and non-beneficial economic expansion against China? The fact is clear: the Japanese government is not respecting but trampling on the spirit of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, and it is not respecting but undermining the basic principles of this agreement.
    (2) The Japanese government stated in its reply that its so-called "support and assistance" for the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement has three prerequisites. The first prerequisite is "within the scope of various domestic laws."
    On March 5, 1958, during a discussion on the implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, both sides unanimously agreed that China and Japan are both countries participating in the Bandung Conference, and both have the obligation to respect, abide by, and implement the ten principles adopted by the Bandung Conference. The personnel of the commercial representative offices dispatched by both sides should respect the laws and customs of the host country. This is a matter of course and is not a problem at all. The question now is what attitude the governments of both sides will take towards the implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement: will they use domestic law to guarantee it, or will they use "domestic law" as an excuse to obstruct and sabotage it? The Japanese government's proposal of "domestic law" as a restrictive condition clearly adopts the latter attitude.
    On the issue of flying the national flag, we have already seen how cunningly the Japanese government uses "domestic law" as an excuse. The relevant departments of the Japanese government have long stated that Article 92 of the Japanese Criminal Law regarding the punishment for damaging foreign national flags does not apply to the People's Republic of China. On April 9, when Nobusuke Kishi answered questions in the Diet, he said that the act of damaging the national flag of the People's Republic of China can only be dealt with according to the criminal law regarding damage to private property. It is the same "domestic law," one applies and the other does not, the purpose of which is to make it impossible for our commercial representative offices to fly their national flag. Who can guarantee that the Japanese government will not use "domestic law" as an excuse to deny our commercial representative offices and their personnel security guarantees and work conveniences? Who can guarantee that the Japanese government will not use "domestic law" as an excuse to force the personnel of our commercial representative offices and their families to fingerprint? If the Japanese government can use "domestic law" as an excuse to overturn all the provisions of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement at any time, how can this agreement be implemented?
    (3) The second prerequisite put forward by the Japanese government is "based on the fact that the government is not recognized."
    It is well known that the state of war between China and Japan has not yet been lifted, and diplomatic relations between China and Japan have not yet been restored. This situation is entirely caused by the Japanese government's pursuit of a hostile policy towards China following the United States, and it is completely inconsistent with the wishes of the people of China and Japan to be friendly and to restore diplomatic relations. The Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement is an agreement between non-governmental organizations on both sides and does not involve the issue of mutual recognition between China and Japan. The Japanese government does not make due guarantees for the implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, but puts forward such an irrelevant prerequisite as "based on the fact that the government is not recognized," which is obviously malicious.
    Everyone knows that the Japanese government's reply was made after several secret talks with the Chiang Kai-shek clique, and this reply was deeply appreciated by the Chiang Kai-shek clique. From this, it can be seen that the actual meaning of the so-called "based on the fact that the government is not recognized" put forward by the Japanese government is to please the Chiang Kai-shek clique.
    The statement made by Aiichiro Fujiyama on behalf of the Japanese government proves that the so-called "based on the fact that the government is not recognized" is just another excuse used by the Japanese government to overturn the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. Aiichiro Fujiyama explained that the Japanese government does not recognize the People's Republic of China, so it does not recognize that our commercial representative offices "have official privileged status" and does not recognize that our commercial representative offices have the right to fly their national flag. The so-called "official privileged status" is completely fabricated, and the purpose is nothing more than to use this as an excuse to try to overturn the provisions in the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement concerning the security guarantees and work conveniences of the commercial representative offices and their personnel. In the past, non-governmental organizations and commodity exhibitions from China and Japan have never felt inconvenient because diplomatic relations between China and Japan have not been restored when flying their national flags in each other's countries. It is of course a representation of one's own country when both sides fly their national flags, but it is an unheard-of anecdote to call the national flag private property. The series of excuses made by the Japanese government on the issue of flying the national flag is also aimed at trying to overturn the relevant provisions in the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement. It is very obvious that in order to please the Chiang Kai-shek clique, the Japanese government does not hesitate to tear up the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement.
    (4) The third prerequisite put forward by the Japanese government is "taking into account the current international relations."
    If the Japanese government needs to consider Japan's current international relations on the issue related to the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, then it should first consider the relationship between Japan and China. That is to say, it should consider how to ensure the smooth implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, so as to strengthen the friendship between the people of China and Japan and open up a path for the restoration of Sino-Japanese diplomatic relations. However, the Japanese government has repeatedly stated that it has no intention of making any consideration in this regard, and it is determined to be hostile to the Chinese people.
    The "current international relations" referred to by the Japanese government mainly and obviously refer to the relationship between Japan and the United States. The United States government has consistently obstructed and sabotaged the development of Sino-Japanese trade. After the signing of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, the United States government not only personally exerted pressure on the Japanese government and carried out crude interference, but also instructed the Chiang Kai-shek clique to take threatening measures against the Japanese government. Under such circumstances, the Japanese government's proposal to "consider" "international relations" can only mean succumbing to the will of the United States government. In this way, how can the implementation of the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement be guaranteed!
    The "international relations" considered by the Japanese government of course also have other contents. For quite some time, the Japanese government has hoped to rely on the strength of the United States to revive the plan of the "Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere." If the Japanese government attempts to make the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement serve its economic expansion plan, then this will completely destroy the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement and make it impossible to implement.
    (5) It can be seen from the three prerequisites put forward by the Japanese government that its so-called "support and assistance" for the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement is actually to make it impossible to implement this agreement. It is only because the Japanese people warmly welcome the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, and the Japanese Diet election is approaching, that the Japanese government hypocritically expressed "support and assistance" in its reply, and dared not openly expose its true intentions.
    (6) The Japanese government blatantly shows hostility to the Chinese people, and does everything possible to sabotage the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, but in the end, it still says in the reply that it wants to "achieve the purpose of expanding trade." It seems that the Japanese government believes that even under humiliating and unequal conditions, China must trade with Japan. The Japanese government should remember that the United States government has gathered the governments of many countries, including the Japanese government, to impose an embargo on China, but it has not been able to, and will never be able to, achieve the purpose of strangling China. New China has not only grown stronger, but is also developing rapidly. Today's China is not the China of twenty years ago, and the Japanese government had better face reality sooner rather than later.
    Our side has always adopted a positive attitude towards the Fourth Sino-Japanese Trade Agreement, and has made the maximum concessions in the negotiations. Your side has made great efforts to sign this agreement, and the Japanese people have placed great hope on this agreement. However, our side must frankly point out that this agreement cannot be implemented until the obstacles set by the Japanese government are removed.

The Telegram from the Three Japanese Organizations to Nan Hanchen

Xinhua News Agency Note:
    (1) The full text of the telegram sent by the three Japanese organizations to Nan Hanchen on April 9 is as follows:

Reply Text: The government, in view of the necessity of expanding Japan-China trade, will respect the spirit of the Fourth Private Japan-China Trade Agreement, within the scope of various domestic laws of our country, and also, based on the fact that the government is not recognized, and taking into account the current international relations, give support and assistance, so as to achieve the purpose of expanding trade.

Statement by Aiichiro Fujiyama, Chief Cabinet Secretary of the Japanese Government

(2) The statement made by Aiichiro Fujiyama, Chief Cabinet Secretary of the Japanese Government, on April 9 is as follows:

    "1. The government believes that the Fourth Private Trade Agreement signed on March 5 by the representatives of the three private trade organizations in our country and the representatives of the private trade organizations on the Communist China side is based on the principle that Japan and China do not interfere in each other's internal affairs and mutually abide by each other's domestic laws, and is specifically signed for the purpose of expanding Japan-China trade according to the economic needs of both Japan and China;
    2. This agreement is an agreement between private organizations on both sides, not an agreement between governments, but the government intends to respect the spirit of seeking to expand trade between the two sides;
    3. It goes without saying that the government has no intention of recognizing Communist China at present. Regarding the private commercial representative offices established according to this private agreement, (the government) has no intention of recognizing that it has the official privileged status, but regarding the issue of this private agreement being handled by private organizations, the government will respect our country's relationship with the Republic of China (referring to the Chiang Kai-shek clique - editor) and other international relations, and consider it, so as not to cause the misunderstanding that "the establishment of commercial representative offices may mean de facto recognition"; At the same time, it intends to give support and assistance within the scope of various domestic laws;
    4. In addition, the Japanese government believes that because Communist China is not recognized at present, it is not reasonable to recognize that the private commercial representative offices have the so-called right to fly the national flag of Communist China."

    南汉宸打电报给日本三个团体
    谴责日政府破坏中日贸易
    断然拒绝接受日本政府的虚伪答复
    新华社13日讯　中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸今天打电报给日本的三个团体，谴责日本政府蓄意破坏第四次中日贸易协定的实施。南汉宸并且声明，中国方面断然拒绝接受日本政府关于第四次中日贸易协定所作的答复。电报全文如下：
    日本国会议员促进日中贸易联盟代表理事
    池田正之辅先生
    日本国际贸易促进协会会长
    山本熊一先生
    日本日中输出入组合理事长
    南乡三郎先生
    9日来电已经收到。
    我方研究了日本政府关于第四次中日贸易协定所作的答复。这个答复表明，日本政府对于第四次中日贸易协定的实施，不但没有提出任何应有的明确的保证，而且蓄意进行破坏。我方断然拒绝接受这个答复，航邮转来的答复正文，将原封退还。
    日本政府的答复虽然尽量闪烁其词，但是无法掩盖它企图推翻第四次中日贸易协定的目的。爱知揆一代表日本政府在4月9日发表的谈话，更使这个目的昭然若揭。
    （一）日本政府在答复中声称，将尊重第四次中日贸易协定的精神。爱知揆一在谈话中也说，日本政府“打算尊重设法扩大双方贸易的精神”。我们且看日本政府实际上所尊重的是什么样的“精神”。第四次中日贸易协定最主要的精神是友好，是通过中日贸易的发展来加强中日两国人民的友谊。爱知揆一在谈话中却强调，日本政府无意承认中华人民共和国，日本政府将尊重同台湾蒋介石集团的关系。这是坚决同六万万中国人民为敌，根本谈不上什么友好精神。第四次中日贸易协定和作为这个协定的不可分割的一部分的备忘录，都贯串着平等互利和互相尊重的精神。爱知揆一的谈话却表明，日本政府准备以不承认我方商务代表机构“具有官方的特权地位”为借口，使贵我双方根据对等的原则在备忘录中作出的各项规定不适用于我方。爱知揆一更公然声明，日本政府不承认我方商务代表机构有权悬挂本国国旗。这是片面撕毁协定，同平等互利和互相尊重的精神毫无共同之处。既然坚决同中国人民为敌，又不遵守平等互利的原则，那么，日本政府的所谓“扩大贸易”，除了意味着企图对中国进行不平等、非互利的经济扩张以外，还能有什么别的含义？事实很清楚，日本政府不是尊重而是蹂躏了第四次中日贸易协定的精神，不是尊重而是破坏了这个协定的基本原则。
    （二）日本政府在答复中表明，它对第四次中日贸易协定的所谓“支持和协助”，有三个前提条件。第一个前提条件是“在国内各项法令的范围内”。
    1958年3月5日，贵我双方在关于执行第四次中日贸易协定的一次谈话中曾经一致同意，中国和日本都是参加万隆会议的国家，对万隆会议通过的十项原则都有尊重和遵守执行的义务，双方互派的商务代表机构的人员都应该尊重驻在国的法律和风俗习惯。这是理所当然的事，根本不成为问题。现在的问题倒是，双方的政府对于第四次中日贸易协定的实施究竟采取什么态度，是用国内法来保证，还是以“国内法”为借口加以阻挠和破坏。日本政府把“国内法”作为一种限制性的条件提出，显然是采取了后一种态度。
    在悬挂国旗的问题上，我们已经看到日本政府是如何狡猾地利用“国内法”作为借口。日本政府的有关方面早就表示，日本刑法第九十二条关于损毁外国国旗的惩罚规定不适用于中华人民共和国。岸信介4月9日在国会答复质询的时候又说，损毁中华人民共和国国旗的行为只能根据损害私人财产的刑律来处理。同样是“国内法”，一条适用，一条不适用，目的都是要使我方商务代表机构无法悬挂本国国旗。谁能保证日本政府不会同样以“国内法”为借口，使我方商务代表机构和所属人员得不到安全保证和工作便利？谁能保证日本政府不会同样以“国内法”为借口，强迫我方商务代表机构的人员和他们的家属按指纹？在日本政府随时可以用“国内法”作为借口推翻第四次中日贸易协定的一切规定的情况下，这个协定如何能够实施？
    （三）日本政府提出的第二个前提条件是“根据没有承认政府这个事实”。
    中日两国之间的战争状态至今还没有解除，中日两国的外交关系至今还没有恢复，这是尽人皆知的。这种情况是日本政府追随美国对中国采取敌视政策所一手造成的，是同中日两国人民要求友好、要求恢复邦交的意愿完全不相符的。第四次中日贸易协定是双方民间团体之间的协定，根本不牵涉到中日两国互相承认的问题。日本政府对于第四次中日贸易协定的实施不作出应有的保证，却提出了所谓“根据没有承认政府”这样一个不相干的前提条件，显然是别有用心的。
    谁都知道，日本政府的答复是在同蒋介石集团进行了多次秘密会谈之后作出的，而且这个答复深为蒋介石集团所赞许。从这里就可以看出，日本政府提出的所谓“根据没有承认政府这个事实”，实际的含义就是要讨好蒋介石集团。
    爱知揆一代表日本政府所发表的谈话证明，所谓“根据没有承认政府这个事实”，不过是日本政府用来推翻第四次中日贸易协定的又一个借口。爱知揆一解释说，日本政府没有承认中华人民共和国，因此不承认我方商务代表机构“具有官方的特权地位”，也不承认我方商务代表机构有权悬挂本国国旗。所谓“官方的特权地位”，完全是凭空捏造，目的无非是以此为借口，企图推翻第四次中日贸易协定中有关双方商务代表机构和所属人员的安全保证和工作便利的规定。中日两国的民间团体和商品展览会在对方国家悬挂本国国旗，过去从来没有因为中日邦交没有恢复而感到不便。双方悬挂国旗当然是代表自己的国家，把国旗说成是私人财产，倒是闻所未闻的今古奇谈。日本政府在悬挂国旗问题上的一系列借口，目的同样是为了企图推翻第四次中日贸易协定中的有关规定。十分明显，日本政府为了讨好蒋介石集团，不惜撕毁第四次中日贸易协定。
    （四）日本政府提出的第三个前提条件是“考虑到目前的国际关系”。
    如果日本政府在有关第四次中日贸易协定的问题上需要考虑目前日本的国际关系，那么，它应该首先考虑日本和中国的关系。这就是说，应该考虑如何保证第四次中日贸易协定的顺利实施，以便加强中日两国人民的友谊，为恢复中日邦交开辟道路。但是，日本政府已经一再表明，它无意在这方面作任何考虑，它坚决同中国人民为敌。
    日本政府所说的“考虑到目前的国际关系”，主要地显然是指日本和美国的关系。美国政府一贯阻挠和破坏中日贸易的发展。第四次中日贸易协定签订以后，美国政府不仅亲自对日本政府施加压力和进行粗暴的干涉，而且指使蒋介石集团对日本政府采取威胁性的措施。在这种情况下，日本政府提出要“考虑”“国际关系”，实际上只能意味着屈从美国政府的意志。这样，第四次中日贸易协定的实施又如何能够得到保证！
    日本政府所考虑的“国际关系”当然也还有别的内容。相当时期以来，日本政府就希望依仗美国的力量来使“大东亚共荣圈”的计划死灰复燃。如果日本政府企图使第四次中日贸易协定为它的经济扩张计划服务，那么，这就会使第四次中日贸易协定破坏无余，根本无法实施。
    （五）从日本政府提出的三个前提条件可以看出，它对第四次中日贸易协定的所谓“支持和协助”实际上是要使这个协定无法实施。只是因为日本人民热烈欢迎第四次中日贸易协定，而且日本国会选举即将到来，日本政府才在答复中虚伪的表示“支持和协助”，而不敢公开暴露它的真实意图。
    （六）日本政府露骨地敌视中国人民，对于第四次中日贸易协定又竭尽破坏的能事，但是在提出的答复中最后竟还说要“达到扩大贸易的目的”。似乎日本政府认为，即使是在屈辱和不平等的条件下，中国也非同日本进行贸易不可。日本政府应该记得，美国政府纠集了许多国家的政府，包括日本政府在内，对中国实行禁运，并没有能够、而且永远不能够达到扼杀中国的目的。新中国不仅已经成长壮大，并且正在以飞跃的速度向前发展。今日的中国已经不是二十年前的中国，日本政府最好早点面对现实。
    我方对于第四次中日贸易协定一贯采取积极的态度，在谈判中也作出了最大限度的让步。贵方对于这个协定的签订曾经尽了极大的努力，日本人民对于这个协定也寄予很大的希望。但是，我方不能不坦率地指出，在日本政府设置的障碍没有扫除以前，这个协定是无法实施的。

    （一）日本三个团体4月9日给南汉宸的电报全文如下：
    中国国际贸易促进委员会主席南汉宸先生：
    今天三团体得到日本政府对第四次中日贸易协定答复如下，特此转达，正文由航空信件寄上。
    答复文：政府鉴于扩大日中贸易的必要性，将尊重第四次民间日中贸易协定的精神，在我国国内各项法令的范围内，同时根据没有承认政府这个事实，还考虑到目前的国际关系，给予支持和协助，以便达到扩大贸易的目的。

    日本政府官房长官爱知揆一的谈话
    （二）日本政府官房长官爱知揆一在4月9日发表的谈话如下：
    “一、政府认为，我国三个民间贸易团体的代表同共产党中国方面的民间贸易团体的代表在3月5日签订的第四次民间贸易协定，是以日中双方互不干涉对方内政、互相遵守对方国内法令为原则，根据日中双方的经济要求，专门为了扩大日中贸易而签订的；
    二、这个协定是双方民间团体之间的协定，不是政府之间的协定，但是政府打算尊重设法扩大双方贸易的精神；
    三、政府现在无意承认共产党中国，这是不消说的。对于根据这个民间协定设立的民间商务代表机构，（政府）无意承认它具有官方的特权地位，但是，关于由民间团体处理这个民间协定的问题，政府将尊重我国同中华民国（指蒋介石集团——编者）的关系和其他国际关系，并且进行考虑，务期不引起“商务代表机构的设立可能意味着事实上的承认”这样的误会；同时打算在国内各项法令规定的范围内给予支持和协助；
    四、此外，日本政府认为，因为目前没有承认共产党中国，所以不能承认民间商务代表机构所谓有权悬挂共产党中国国旗，这是理所当然的事情。”
