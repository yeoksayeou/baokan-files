	Thanks to the Medicine Delivery Person
	On March 29th, I took my child to the Fuqian Street Clinic of the Beijing Children's Hospital for treatment. After the injection, I hurried home. The next afternoon, a comrade came to find me. He said he was from the Children's Hospital. After confirming that I had taken my child to see a doctor yesterday and checking the registration certificate, he told me that I had forgotten to pick up the medicine yesterday, and he had made a special trip to deliver it today. I strangely asked him how he knew my address? He said he had checked the medical records and rode his bike for a long time to find it. I was truly grateful at that moment. It was dozens of miles from Jiuxianqiao in the eastern suburbs, and his act of sacrificing his Sunday to deliver medicine tirelessly is worthy of our study.

    感谢送药人
    3月29日我带小孩到北京市儿童医院府前街门诊部看病，打过针后，就慌慌忙忙地回家了。第二天下午，有一个同志来找我，他说是儿童医院的。他问明了我昨天曾带孩子去看过病和查对好挂号证后，他告诉我昨天忘记了取药，他今天特为送药而来的。我奇怪地问他怎么知道我的地址？他说是查过病历，骑车找了好久才找到的。我当时真有说不出的感激。距东郊酒仙桥几十里路，他这种牺牲星期天不辞辛苦地送药的行为是值得我们学习的。　程瑞华
