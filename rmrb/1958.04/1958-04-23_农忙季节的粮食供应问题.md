Currently, it is the busy season for spring plowing and sowing, and many water conservancy projects are also striving to be completed before the rainy season arrives. In the past, some rural areas often experienced spring shortages during this period. Now, agricultural cooperation and the policy of unified purchase and sale can completely overcome and defeat spring shortages, which is not a problem. However, we should still strive to do a good job in grain supply during this period, fundamentally prevent and eliminate the phenomenon of spring shortages, and further fully guarantee the great leap forward in agricultural production this year. Therefore, we suggest that all localities quickly grasp the work of grain supply during the busy farming season.

There are two ways to guarantee grain supply. One way is to not strictly distinguish between who lacks grain and who does not, and to supply whoever asks for it, relying entirely on state allocations for the grain supplied. The result of doing so is that the grain supply in rural areas is guaranteed, but some people who do not need so much supply also receive more supply, wasting a large amount of state grain and affecting the stability of the implementation of the grain unified purchase and sale policy. The other way is to strictly distinguish between grain-deficient households and non-grain-deficient households on the basis of saving grain and planned grain use, effectively guaranteeing the essential supply for grain-deficient households, and paying for the supplied grain first from the agricultural cooperative's reserve grain and the state-approved supply grain. Only when the agricultural cooperative's reserve grain and the state's original approved supply quotas are truly insufficient, should the supply quota be appropriately increased with the approval of a certain authority. The result of doing so is that it effectively supports agricultural production and rationally controls the state's grain sales. We should firmly adopt the latter approach.

The overall situation of grain supply in rural areas is good at present, but this does not mean that there are no problems at all in all places. In some places, the problems have not been completely resolved. On the one hand, due to the large-scale water conservancy construction and fertilizer accumulation movements carried out in rural areas from last winter to this spring, and now it is the high tide of spring farming production, the farmers' working hours and labor intensity have increased, and thus the grain consumption has also increased accordingly. In this way, some farmers, even if they pay attention to saving, do feel that their rations are insufficient. This is particularly evident in some disaster areas. On the other hand, after the increase in grain consumption, many farmers whose own grain at home could have been enough, or could have been enough with a little saving, are reluctant to see their own stocks consumed, and they also ask for supply. For the former, necessary care should be given to ensure their necessary grain supply. For the latter, they should be clearly explained that in the future, with the great leap forward in production, the grain distributed will gradually increase, and they should not ask for supply now if they can manage. Facts have proved that wherever this principle is correctly implemented, the grain supply problem is smoothly resolved, the grain sales situation remains normal, and the farmers' enthusiasm for production is even higher.

The grain supplied to grain-deficient households, in addition to being allocated from the state's original approved supply grain, mainly relies on the reserve grain within the agricultural cooperative to solve the problem. According to reports from various places, many agricultural cooperatives have a batch of reserve grain and revolving grain in their hands, some with tens of thousands of jin, some with hundreds of thousands of jin, and some with one hundred and tens of thousands of jin or even more. If these grains are used to properly adjust the grain supply within the cooperative, the vast majority of agricultural cooperatives can solve the problem themselves without breaking through the state's original supply quota, or without the need for the state to increase new supply quotas.

The fundamental way to solve the grain problem is the continuous leap forward in agricultural production. Therefore, our grain supply work must be conducive to the great leap forward in production and must serve production. This point cannot be ignored in any case. However, it should also be seen that China's current grain situation is still not affluent. We must not inappropriately increase the state's supply quotas because grain production will continue to leap forward, and we must not use the method of emptying the state's grain reserves to raise the level of grain consumption. Doing so will leave the state without sufficient strength to guarantee reasonable needs in all aspects, and it will be impossible to implement the policy of making up for deficiencies with surpluses nationwide. Moreover, judging from the situation in some places, while grain production is leaping forward, farmers' consumption is also increasing rapidly, and it is temporarily impossible to replenish a lot of grain reserves for the state. Therefore, we should not casually increase the state's grain sales. All parts of the country must continue to implement the policy of diligence and thrift without exception, and continue to adhere to the policy of planned grain distribution and unified purchase and sale.

The current approach to grain supply work can be summarized as follows: (1) It is required to both promote the development of production and strive not to break through the state's supply quotas. (2) Effectively guarantee the supply of grain-deficient households, oppose the practice of disregarding the interests of grain-deficient farmers, and at the same time resolutely prevent the phenomenon of universally increasing grain sales, so as not to empty the state's grain reserves, and we must adhere to the work of unified grain sales. (3) We should conscientiously conduct inspections and rectifications in places where there are problems, solve the problems where there are problems, and solve the problems of those who have problems; those who should be supplied will be guaranteed supply, and those who should not be supplied will be resolutely not supplied. Because the socialist consciousness of the broad masses of peasants has been universally improved, this approach can be completely accepted by the masses of peasants.

### 农忙季节的粮食供应问题

    农忙季节的粮食供应问题
    目前正是春耕播种的农忙时期，不少水利工程也要争取在雨季到来以前突击完成。过去在这个时候往往有些农村会发生春荒，现在农业合作化和统购统销政策完全可以克服和战胜春荒，这是不成问题的；但是我们仍然应该努力做好这一时期的粮食供应工作，从根本上防止和消灭春荒现象，并且进一步充分地保证今年农业生产的大跃进。因此，我们建议各地要迅速抓紧农忙时期的粮食供应工作。
    保证粮食供应可以有两种作法。一种作法是不严格区别谁缺粮谁不缺粮，要求供应就供应，供应的粮食都依靠国家拨给。这样做的结果是农村的粮食供应有保证了，但是有些不必多供应的人也多得到了供应，浪费了国家大量的粮食，影响到粮食统购统销政策执行的稳定性。另一种作法是在节约粮食、计划用粮的基础上，严格区别缺粮户与非缺粮户，切实保证缺粮户必不可少的供应，供应的粮食首先在农业社的机动粮和国家核定的供应粮内支付，只有在农业社机动粮和国家原来核定的供应指标确实不够的时候，才经过一定机关批准适当增加供应指标。这样做的结果是既有效地支援了农业生产，又合理地控制了国家的粮食销量。我们应该坚决采取后一种作法。
    目前农村的粮食供应的总情况是好的，但是这并不是说所有的地方都完全没有问题了。有一些地方问题还没有完全解决。一方面由于去冬今春农村开展了大规模的兴修水利和积肥运动，目前又值春耕生产的高潮，农民的劳动时间和劳动强度增加了，因而粮食消费量也相应地增加了。这样，有些农民即使注意节约，也确实感到口粮不足。特别是在某些灾区表现得较为显著。另一方面是在粮食消费量增加以后，许多农民本来家里的粮食完全可以过得去，或者节约一点就可以过得去，但是他们看到自己的存粮消费掉了，有些舍不得，也就要求供应。对于前一种人，应该给予必要的照顾，保证他们必需的粮食供应。对于后一种人，应该很好地向他们讲清道理，说明今后随着生产大跃进，分得的粮食会逐渐多起来，现在能够过得去就不应该再要求供应了。事实证明，哪个地方正确地执行了这个原则，哪个地方的粮食供应问题就顺利地得到解决，粮食销售情况就保持了正常，农民生产情绪就更加高涨。
    供应缺粮户的粮食，除掉可以从国家原来核定的供应粮内拨付以外，主要的还是依靠农业社内的机动粮来解决。根据各地反映，许多农业社手里都掌握一批机动粮和周转粮，有几万斤的，有几十万斤的，有一百几十万斤甚至更多的。如果把这些粮食用来很好地调剂社内的粮食供应，绝大多数农业社可以自己解决问题，而不致突破国家原定的供应指标，或者无需国家增加新的供应指标。
    解决粮食问题的根本途径，是农业生产的不断跃进。因此，我们的粮食供应工作必须有利于生产大跃进，必须为生产服务，这一点无论如何不可忽视。但是也要看到，我国目前的粮食状况还是不富裕的。我们决不能因为粮食生产将不断跃进而不适当地增加国家的供应指标，决不能用弄空国家粮食库存的办法来提高粮食消费的水平。这样做会使国家没有足够的力量来保证各方面的合理需要，无法在全国范围内实行以丰补歉的方针。而且从某些地方的情况看，在粮食生产跃进的同时，农民的消费也增加得较快，暂时还不可能给国家补充很多粮食库存。因此，我们就不应该随便增加国家的粮食销量。全国各地必须无例外地继续贯彻执行勤俭节约的方针，继续坚持粮食的计划分配和统购统销政策。
    目前粮食供应工作的作法，总起来说就是：（一）要求做到既能促进生产的发展，又要力求不突破国家供应指标。（二）切实保证缺粮户的供应，反对漠视缺粮农民利益的做法，同时要坚决防止普遍增销粮食的现象，以至于弄空国家的粮食库存，而必须坚持粮食统销工作。（三）对有问题的地方应该认真地进行检查和整顿，哪里有问题就解决哪里的问题，哪些人有问题就解决哪些人的问题；该供应的就保证供应，不该供应的就坚决不供应。由于广大农民社会主义觉悟普遍提高，这样作是完全能够为农民群众所接受的。
