    In the twilight, we arrived at Shizhuang.
    Shizhuang is a small market town on the north bank of the Yangtze River. Here, there is a simple inn—the East Wind Inn.
    The owner is a young man in his early twenties. His wife took their daughter to the countryside to sweep the tombs. His mother is a member of the Four Pests Elimination Inspection Team and has been out since morning.
    The owner assigned me to room number one in the backyard, brewed a pot of tea, and then brought the registration book. After I wrote "Soldier" in the occupation column, he hurriedly said to me:
    "Sorry to trouble you, comrade! I have to go out tonight to participate in road construction, and I probably won't be back all night. If any guests arrive, please take care of them..."
    "This might not be appropriate, right?" I became a little anxious.
    "It's alright, I've already told the neighbors." Before I could reply, he shouldered his shovel and hurried out.
    I couldn't calm down for a long time. The owner confidently entrusted this large courtyard with more than a dozen rooms to a stranger? In the more than ten years, I've stayed in so many hotels and inns, I've never encountered such a thing...
    Suddenly, a clear female voice came from outside the courtyard: "Is anyone here?"
    This made me hesitate for a moment, but the sound of footsteps was already approaching my door. The visitor spoke first:
      "The owner isn't home again today. He's probably gone to build roads again."
    From the school badge on her chest, I could tell she was probably a middle school teacher.
    She picked up the registration book, wrote her name, and in the other items wrote: "See the day before yesterday..." She explained: "The day before yesterday, I went to the county for a meeting and stayed here overnight. That day, the owner's family went to build roads at night, and it's probably the same today..."
    After she returned to her room, I soon fell asleep.
    Around midnight, I suddenly heard the teacher laughing. After I was fully awake, I realized that more guests had arrived, and the teacher was receiving them.
    The owner of the inn had not yet returned. We had to fulfill some of our guiding duties to the new guests. One of the guests was an old horticulturist from Yangzhou who came to the prefecture's farm to order saplings; the other was a young salesman from a fertilizer factory in Shanghai.
    The horticulturist was already an old man of sixty. After sitting down and taking a sip of tea, he began to talk to us about sparrows. He wiped his glasses and asked, "Do you know what color sparrows are?"
    "Of course, they are gray!" the female teacher answered quickly.
    "Have you ever seen a black sparrow?"
    Everyone shook their heads.
    "But a black sparrow appeared in our Yangzhou city—"
    The horticulturist slowly sipped his tea. The female teacher stared wide-eyed, and the young salesman looked at the old man inexplicably.
    "Our Four Pests Elimination army almost caught all the sparrows. In the end, one sparrow, probably afraid it couldn't escape the dragnet, desperately dove into a chimney, getting covered in black soot and turning into a black sparrow. After it flew out, some people thought it was a turtle dove, but it was eventually recognized, and still shot dead..."
    Everyone burst into laughter, and all sleepiness disappeared. Finally, the horticulturist asked the young salesman:
  "Young man, where are you going?"
      "The factory originally sent me to Dongtai and Yancheng counties, but as soon as I crossed the river, the fertilizer was all ordered by the nearby agricultural counties. I plan to return to Shanghai tomorrow."
    The night was already very late. Everyone said goodbye and returned to their rooms.
    When I woke up, the sun was already shining into the yard. After I got up, I found that the guests in each room had already left. They had all left the room rent, and had taken the reimbursement receipts themselves.

    在东升客栈里
    崔左夫
    夜色苍茫中，我们赶到了石庄。
    石庄是长江北岸的一个小集镇，这儿有一家简朴的客栈——东升客栈。
    主人是一个二十开外的年轻人，妻子带着女儿下乡扫墓去了，母亲是除四害检查小组的成员，从早上出了门就没有回来。
    主人指定我住在后院的第一号房间里，泡来一壶茶，接着送来登记簿，等我在登记簿的职业一栏里写完了“军人”两个字后，他便急急忙忙地朝我说：
    “麻烦你了，同志！我今天夜里要出去参加修路，恐怕一夜不能回来，假使有宿客来请你照顾着点……”
    “这恐怕不行吧？”我有些着急起来。
    “不妨，我已经跟邻居说过了。”不等我回话，他就扛起铁锹匆匆走出去了。
    我心里好久平静不下来，这十几间房子的一个大院子，主人便放心地交给一个陌生的宿客？十多年来，我住过多少个旅馆、客栈，还没有遇见过这样的事……
    院子外面忽然传来一声清脆的女子的声音：“有人在吗？”
    这使我踌躇了一会，可是脚步声已经逼近到我的门口了。来客先开了口：
      “今天主家又没人啊，大概又去修路去了。”
    从她胸前的校徽看出来，大约是一个中学教师。
    她拿起登记簿来写完自己的名字，在其他的项目里写着：“详见前天……”她解释说：“前天我到县里去开会，路过这里宿了一夜，那天主人家夜里修路去了，大概今天又是……”
    等她回到自己的宿室之后，不久我便睡着了。
    大概到半夜的时候，忽然听到教师的笑声，等我完全清醒了之后，才知道又有投宿的客人来了，教师在接待他们。
    客栈的主人还没有回来。我们只好对新的宿客尽一些指点的义务了。宿客之一是一位老园艺家，从扬州到专区农场来订购树苗的；另一位是上海一家化肥工厂的年轻推销员。
    园艺家已经是六十岁老人了，他坐下来，呷了一口茶之后，便对我们谈起麻雀来。他一边擦拭着自己的眼镜，一边问：“你们知道麻雀是什么颜色的？”
    “当然是灰色的啊！”女教师抢着回答。
    “你们没看到黑色的麻雀吧？”
    大家摇摇头。
    “可是我们扬州市就出现了一只黑麻雀——”
    园艺家慢慢地呷起茶来了，女教师瞪大了眼睛，年轻推销员莫名其妙地望着老人。
    “我们的除四害大军几乎把麻雀全捉光了，最后有一只麻雀大概也怕逃不出天罗地网，便急得一头钻进一家烟筒里，弄得一身黑灰，变成黑麻雀了。等它飞出来之后，有人当它是斑鸠，可是终究被人认出了，还是一枪结果了它……”
    大家都失声大笑，睡意都消失了。最后园艺家问年轻推销员说：
  “老弟，你到哪儿去？”
      “厂里本来派我到东台、盐城各县去的，可是才过江，化肥就被附近几个农业县订购完了，我明天便打算回上海。”
    夜已经很深了，大家告别了回到自己的房间里。
    一觉醒来，太阳已经射进院子。等我起来之后，发觉每个房间的宿客都已经离去了，他们都一一留下了房钱，并且自己开走了报销单。
