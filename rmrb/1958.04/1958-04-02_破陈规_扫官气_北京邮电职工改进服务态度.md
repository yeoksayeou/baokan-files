Break Old Rules, Sweep Away Bureaucratic Air
Beijing Postal and Telecommunications Workers Improve Service Attitude

(Our report) Beijing's postal and telecommunications workers have put forward the slogan of catching up with "Dongsi," and a "Six Comparisons" movement centered on service will be launched in the city's postal and telecommunications enterprises.

The workers of the Dongsi Post and Telecommunications Bureau in Beijing, after the "Double-Anti" campaign and learning from the "Tianqiao" experience, have shown a new look in their work. In the past, the attitude of this post office towards customers was cold. They followed the old rules of the past, and would not write letters for others, nor would they fill out remittance slips or parcel slips for those who could not write. At the sealed mouth of the insured envelope, the post office handler did not sign, but instead asked the sender to sign. In short, all the regulations of the post office were like "laws," and those who did not obey were refused. Now they have broken the old rules and bad habits, swept away the yamen style, and actively and enthusiastically help those who have difficulty writing to write letters, fill out remittance slips, telegrams, etc. They also implemented "one-stop service" (each person handles various businesses), which improved work efficiency. In the past, it took about half an hour to remit money or send a registered letter, but now it only takes five minutes. Subscriptions and retail purchases of newspapers and periodicals have also become more convenient. The time for delivering newspapers in the morning is one hour earlier than before, and the business hours have been extended by five hours. This practice has been warmly welcomed by the masses.

The Beijing Municipal Committee of the China Postal and Telecommunications Workers' Union held a city-wide postal and telecommunications workers' mobilization meeting on the 24th, proposing to launch a "Six Comparisons" movement centered on service in the city, calling on everyone to learn from the Dongsi Post and Telecommunications Bureau.

    破陈规　扫官气
    北京邮电职工改进服务态度
    本报讯　北京市的邮电职工提出了赶“东四”的口号，一个以服务为中心的“六比”运动将在全市的邮电企业里展开。
    北京东四邮电局的职工，经过“双反”和学习了“天桥”经验之后，工作上出现了新的面貌。过去这个邮局对顾客的态度是冷冰冰的，他们沿袭着过去的老规矩，不代人写信，也不代不能写字的人填写汇款单、包裹单。在保价信封口处，邮局的经手人不签字，反要寄款人签字。总之，邮局的一切规定就像“法律”，不服从者一律拒绝接受。现在他们打破了陈规陋习，扫除了衙门作风，主动热情地帮助写字有困难的人写信、填汇款单、电报等。他们还实行一台清（每个人管各种业务），提高了工作效率。过去汇款或寄挂号信要花半小时左右，现在只要五分钟就行了。订阅和零购报刊也方便了。早上送报的时间比过去提前了一小时，营业时间延长了五小时。这种做法受到群众的热烈欢迎。
    中国邮电工会北京市委员会在24日举行全市邮电职工动员大会，提出在全市开展一个以服务为中心的“六比”运动，号召大家向东四邮电局学习。
