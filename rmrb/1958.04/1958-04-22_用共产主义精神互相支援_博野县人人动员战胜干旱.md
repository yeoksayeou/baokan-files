    Using Communist Spirit to Support Each Other
    Bo Ye County Mobilizes Everyone to Overcome Drought
    (Our report) Bo Ye County, Hebei Province, in the anti-drought movement, carried out an in-depth county-wide field inspection, grasped the key points, divided areas and assigned responsibilities, and concentrated efforts to eliminate the blank spots in water conservancy construction. The masses promoted the communist spirit, and villages supported each other, achieving remarkable results in drought resistance. Within ten days, more than 90,000 mu of wheat in the county had been watered one to four times, and more than 160,000 mu of the 220,000 mu of unplanted land had been watered. Efforts are being made to complete the watering of all irrigable land in the near future to ensure timely sowing.
    Bo Ye County has a total of 370,000 mu of land. After the hard work of the people of the county last winter and this spring, great achievements have been made in water conservancy construction. Therefore, at the beginning of the anti-drought sowing movement, some township and commune cadres believed that there was no problem with anti-drought sowing and were not actively resisting drought. In order to find out the drought situation and do a good job in the anti-drought movement, the Bo Ye County Party Committee mobilized more than 1,400 township and commune cadres in early April to form more than 100 inspection teams to go deep into the fields to check water sources, tools, and dry land. The result was that every village had white spots (dry land), and every township had large areas (dry land). Even the six townships that had reported to the county party committee that they had realized water conservancy had a lot of dry land that could not be irrigated. Among them, Xiao Dian Township, which was in a relatively good situation, still had more than 1,700 mu of dry land that could not be irrigated. These dry lands that cannot be irrigated are divided into three situations: First, the land at the junction of communes and the "running land" of Commune A within the farming range of Commune B; second, small pieces of land and some high-lying land; third, land without water conservancy conditions, far from the wells, with no way to irrigate. In terms of checking water sources, the water sources of the wells and springs dug this year are generally very good, but there is a lack of water lifting tools, which cannot fully utilize the benefits of water conservancy projects. In particular, of the more than 110 motorized wells dug this year, only more than 30 power machines are available, so water cannot be used even if it is available. The facts found made the township and commune cadres realize that the task of drought resistance is still very serious, and if effective measures are not taken, timely sowing and a good harvest cannot be guaranteed.
    Immediately after the "three checks", Bo Ye County immediately took the drought-stricken land found as the focus, divided the areas and assigned responsibilities, and mobilized the masses to concentrate their efforts on watering and fighting drought. The county party committee put forward the battle slogan for drought resistance: "The whole party and the whole people are mobilized, and every township eliminates large areas (of dry land); villages support each other, promote the communist spirit, launch a general attack on dry land, and ensure sowing without rain throughout the county, and ensure a good harvest without rain." Starting from April 5, fourteen county party committee members led township and commune cadres to establish more than 120 field headquarters in the fields to specifically lead the drought resistance work. A total of more than 47,000 people in the county were mobilized, accounting for 82% of the total labor force in the county, and put into the drought resistance movement. All the cadres of the organs, except for a few people who supported the work of the organs, were all put into the drought resistance movement. The specific method is: organ cadres go to the fields to rectify their work style; middle and primary school students work and study half-time; commercial and industrial systems repair and supply in the fields. The county's handicraft cooperative has more than 130 workers, and more than 50 people were drawn to the fields to help agricultural cooperatives repair farm tools and install machines. The county's tractor station dispatched 19 45-horsepower boiler tractors to agricultural cooperatives to pump water for irrigation and solve the difficulty of insufficient water lifting tools.
    After this county grasped the key points and implemented specific leadership in the fields, it found problems in a timely manner and solved problems quickly. Dong Jia Zhuang Agricultural Cooperative of Shi Jia Zuo Township only has more than 120 brick wells, one motorized well and one cistern, and the irrigation range is only more than 300 mu of land. There are still more than 3,000 mu of dry land without water conservancy conditions, which cannot be irrigated, affecting sowing. The field headquarters helped the commune cadres to study, letting the water of these more than 120 wells converge together to irrigate the distant land without water conservancy conditions, and as a result, land six li away from the well was irrigated. Regarding the problem of surplus or shortage of water sources between communes, the county party committee called on to promote the communist spirit, support each other, and eliminate dry land. Cao Zhuang and Mi Zhuang villages in Xiao Dian Township organized a confluence of 72 wells with Xiao Dian Village after watering the dry land in their villages, and also watered the 500 mu of dry land in Xiao Dian Village without water conservancy conditions. A total of more than 150 confluences were organized in the county, which can expand the irrigated area by more than 32,000 mu. In addition, agricultural cooperatives in the county also organized more than 25,000 people to support drought resistance in the five key areas with poor water conservancy conditions and more dry land.
    Bo Ye County also mobilized the masses to find all kinds of ways to manufacture water lifting tools to solve the problem of lack of power for motorized wells. The horse-drawn water pump made by Ditou Village Agricultural Cooperative has the effect of a 3.5-horsepower machine, costing only 250 yuan per unit. Installed on the motorized well, two animals can pull it to irrigate more than 20 mu of land day and night. After promotion, more than 40 horse-drawn water pumps were manufactured in the county, plus tractor pumping and existing machines, which can basically solve the problem of water lifting tools for motorized wells. Now, the county is planning to deeply cone all 250 brick wells in the county, complete the task of drilling 260 motorized wells and three spring openings in the county before July 1. It also decided to make use of all available water sources, and to implement a method of assigning people, wells, and plots of land from the township to the commune, contracting everything to the end throughout the year. In this way, even if it does not rain for the next seven months, a good harvest can be guaranteed throughout the county.

    用共产主义精神互相支援
    博野县人人动员战胜干旱
    本报讯　河北省博野县在抗旱运动中，深入开展全县田间大检查，并且抓住重点，分片包干，集中力量突击消灭水利建设的空白点，群众发扬共产主义精神，村村互相支援，取得抗旱的显著成就。十天内，全县九万多亩小麦已经浇水一遍到四遍，二十二万多亩白地已浇完十六万多亩，并争取近日内把能浇的全部浇完，保证适时播种。
    博野县共有土地三十七万亩，经过全县人民去冬今春的苦战，水利建设获得很大成绩。因此在抗旱播种运动开始时，有些乡、社干部认为抗旱播种没啥问题，不积极抗旱。为了摸清旱情，搞好抗旱运动，博野县委4月初发动乡、社干部一千四百多人，组成一百多个检查组，深入田间查水源、查工具、查旱地。结果发现村村有白点（旱地），乡乡有大片（旱地）。就是已经向县委报喜实现水利化的六个乡，也有不少旱地不能浇上水。其中情况比较好的小店乡，还有一千七百多亩旱地不能浇水。这些不能浇水的旱地，共分三种情况：第一是社与社接合部的土地和甲社在乙社耕作范围内的“跑地”；第二是小片土地和一些高岗地；第三是没有水利条件的土地，离水井又远，没有办法浇。在查水源方面，今年打的水井和凿泉等工程一般的水源很好，但提水工具缺乏，不能充分发挥水利工程的效益。尤其今年打的一百一十多眼机井，只有三十多台动力机器，有水也用不上。检查出来的事实，使乡社干部认识到抗旱任务还十分严重，如不采取有效措施，就不能保证适时播种和保证丰收。
    紧接着“三查”之后，博野县立即把查出的旱地作为重点，分片包干发动群众集中力量浇水抗旱。县委提出了抗旱的战斗口号：“全党全民总动员，乡乡消灭大片（旱地）；村村互相支援，发扬共产主义精神，向旱地总攻击，保证全县无雨保播种，无雨保丰收。”从4月5日开始，十四个县委委员领导乡、社干部，在野外建立了一百二十多处田野指挥部，具体领导抗旱工作。全县共发动了四万七千多人，占全县总劳动力的82％，投入了抗旱运动。所有的机关干部，除少数人支持机关工作外，全部投入了抗旱运动。具体作法是：机关干部到田野整风；中、小学学生半工半读；商业、工业系统田间修配，田间供应。县手工业社共有一百三十多名工人，抽出了五十多人到田间帮助农业社修配农具，安装机器。这个县的拖拉机站抽出了十九台四十五马力的锅驼机，给农业社抽水浇地，解决提水工具不足的困难。
    这个县抓住重点，深入田野实行具体领导以后，发现问题及时了，解决问题也快了。史家佐乡董家庄农业社只有一百二十多眼砖井、一眼机井和一个水柜，浇地范围只有三百多亩地，还有三千多亩旱地没有水利条件，不能浇水，影响播种。田野指挥部就帮助社干部进行了研究，让这一百二十多眼井的水汇流在一起，浇远处没有水利条件的土地，结果离水井六里路的土地都浇到了。对于社与社水源余缺的问题，县委号召发扬共产主义精神，互相支援，消灭旱地。小店乡曹庄、米庄两村把本村旱地浇完以后，又与小店村组织了一个七十二眼井的汇浇，把小店村没有水利条件的五百亩旱地也都浇完了。全县共组织了一百五十多处汇浇，共能扩大浇地三万二千多亩。另外，全县各社还组织了二万五千多人，分别到水利条件差、旱地多的五个重点地区支援抗旱。
    博野县还发动群众想尽各种办法制造提水工具，解决机井缺少动力的困难。堤头村农业社制成的马拉水泵，效力相当三点五马力的机器，每台只花钱二百五十元，安在机井上，两个牲口拉，一天一夜能浇地二十多亩。经过推广，全县制成了马拉水泵四十多台，再加上拖拉机抽水和原有的机器，基本上能解决机井提水工具问题。现在，这个县正计划把全县二百五十眼砖井进行深锥，在7月1日前完成全县打二百六十眼机井的任务和三处开泉工程。还决定把一切能够利用的水源都利用起来，并且从乡到社实行定人、定井、定地块的办法，全年一包到底。这样，即使今后七个月不下雨，也能保证全县丰收。
