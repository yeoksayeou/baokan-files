    Opinions on the Publishing Industry
    I have a few suggestions for the publishing industry, offered for reference.
    1. For some modern works, it is best not to print and bind them in the thread-bound style unless absolutely necessary. For example, "Fragments of Ancient History" (written by Mr. Zhou Gucheng), published by New Knowledge Publishing House in December 1956, contains only 28,000 characters, but was printed on 36 sheets (72 pages), priced at 1.20 yuan. If it were printed in a modern, general paperback format, it would save a lot of money. "The Invention and Development of Ancient Chinese Iron Smelting Technology" (written by Mr. Yang Kuan, published by Shanghai People's Publishing House in October 1956), contains 71,000 characters, more than twice the number of characters in "Fragments of Ancient History," but it was printed on only 113 pages, priced at only 0.40 yuan. We certainly cannot calculate the value of academic works solely based on the number of characters and pages, but it is always desirable to save some money on printing and binding.
    2. It is worth considering whether there is an urgent need to print some classical books in facsimile editions at present. For example, "Supplement to the Journey to the West" (written by Dong Shuo in the early Qing Dynasty), published by the Literature and Antiquities Publishing House in 1955, contains only 16 chapters, but because it is a facsimile edition, it is in two volumes, priced at 2.85 yuan. Then, how much would a set of "Journey to the West" cost? Is it also necessary to print it in facsimile? I don't think it is necessary at present.
    3. In some scientific books and journals with illustrations or albums, the illustrations and the explanatory text for the annotations are printed separately, which makes it inconvenient for people to read and compare them by flipping back and forth. Why is it possible to indicate "Figure ×" under the figure, but it is not possible to find a way to directly note the explanatory text?
    4. For some scientific atlases, it seems that efforts should also be made to save some money on the necessary aesthetic, elegant forms. For example, "Selected Ceramics" (edited by the Palace Museum), published by Cultural Relics Publishing House in December 1957, contains only eleven figures (one object with two figures), and there is not even a necessary brief description of the content. The thin volume is priced at 6.50 yuan.
    I believe that when publishing books, in addition to ensuring quality, we should try to save as much as possible on printing and binding, which can not only save some state funds, but also be beneficial to the popularization of culture and science, and beneficial to readers and authors.

### 对出版界的意见

    对出版界的意见
    我对出版界有几点建议，提出供参考。
    1、有些现代著作，如果没有太大的必要时，最好不要印订成线装式。如新知识出版社1956年12月出版的“古史零证”（周谷城先生著），全书只有二万八千字，就印了三十六张（七十二面），定价为一元二角。如果印成现代一般的平装本，就会节约很多。“中国古代冶铁技术的发明和发展”（上海人民出版社1956年10月出版，杨宽先生著），全书为七万一千字，比“古史零证”字数多出一倍多，但是才印了一百一十三页，定价仅四角。我们对于学术上的著作，固然不能光从字数和页数上去计算价值，但是，能在印刷装订上节约一些，总是应该的。
    2、有些古典书籍，目前是否需要急于印成影印本，是值得考虑的。如文学古籍刊行社1955年出版的“西游补”（清初董说撰），全书只有十六回，因是影印，就成了两本，定价为二元八角五分。那末，一套“西游记”该多少钱呢？是否也需要影印呢？我觉得目前是不必要的。
    3、有些科学性的书刊插图或图录的专集，把图与附注的说明文字分开排印，使人阅读时前后翻阅对照很感不便。为什么能在图下注明“图×”，而就不能想法直接把说明文字注出呢？
    4、有些科学图录，在必要的讲求美观、大方的形式上，似乎也应该设法节约一些。如文物出版社1957年12月出版的“陶瓷选集”（故宫博物院编），全书仅十一图（内一物二图），连个必要的内容简述也没有，薄薄一本，就定价六元五角。
    我觉得出版书籍时除了保证质量外，印刷装订方面应该尽量节约一些，这不仅可以节省一些国家资财，同时，对文化科学事业的普及也有利，对读者、作者也都有好处。
