Qiqihar Iron Industry Cooperative Waterwheel Parts Structure is Not Tight

Recently, the Shaanxi Provincial Supply and Marketing Cooperative purchased three thousand 21-type Liberation waterwheels from the Qiqihar Iron Industry Production Cooperative. When these were distributed to agricultural cooperatives in Xi'an, Li County, Pucheng, and other places, it was generally found that the waterwheel pipes leaked and were unusable. The reason for the leakage was found to be the loose structure of the waterwheel parts. Almost every waterwheel had problems such as loose pipe joints and mismatched screw caps and screw threads. I suggest that the Qiqihar Iron Industry Production Cooperative should ensure product quality in the future and strengthen the product inspection system to prevent substandard goods from leaving the factory and affecting agricultural production.

    齐齐哈尔铁业合作社  水车零件结构不严密
    陕西省供销合作社最近从齐齐哈尔市铁业生产合作社买来三千台21型解放式水车，在拨到西安、醴县、蒲城等地供给农业社使用的时候，普遍发现水车管子漏水不能用。检查漏水的原因是水车零件结构不严密，几乎每一台水车都有管子接头松、螺丝帽与螺丝口大小不合适等毛病。我建议齐齐哈尔市铁业生产合作社今后要保证产品质量，加强产品检验制度，免得次品劣货出厂，影响农业生产。　那学勤
