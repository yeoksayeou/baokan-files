    Various Ways of "Passing the Test"
    Jin Wen

    Currently, the ideological remolding of intellectuals is being carried out vigorously with great destruction and great construction. Some say that this is "passing the socialist test," and "this test is difficult to pass." Indeed, if one is unwilling to resolutely discard the ugly bourgeois ideology, it is indeed not easy to "pass the test." Aren't there people who "lie down," some who "ask for leave," and some who "feign illness"? There are also three attitudes among those who are "passing the test." The first attitude is to genuinely pass, the second attitude is to pass half-heartedly, and the third is to pretend to pass.

    Those who hold the first attitude are genuinely willing to bury bourgeois ideology and truly want to embrace socialist ideology. They make a painful decision, are fully rational, and are determined to remold themselves. Before their comrades' big-character posters mention them, they first expose themselves. In heart-to-heart talks or debates, when comrades raise recent issues, they relate them to the past; when they are given fragments, they consider the whole picture; when they are presented with phenomena, they try to analyze the essence. What they don't recognize, after realistic debates, they admit as it is. They calmly consider any sharp criticism. Regarding opinions that are not entirely correct or incorrect, they consider the other party's desire to cure the disease and save the person. They also experience a painful process, but this process is not long. They are sincerely and realistically "passing the test."

    Those who hold the second attitude, although they also want to truly remold themselves, become half-hearted because they lack a realistic and scientific attitude. Some people "take everything on themselves," and some people "take a roundabout route." "Taking everything on themselves" means that they admit everything others say, and even the "hats" they put on themselves during self-criticism are more and larger than those criticized by others. Therefore, the "test" is passed, but the ideological baggage has not been completely discarded. "Taking a roundabout route" is the opposite of "taking everything on themselves." They admit some, reserve some, and even emphasize objective reasons, even finding reasons to deny things that should not be denied. Overall, these two types of people have a sincere attitude, and their self-struggle is also very intense. The problem is that the former should, after self-criticism, raise any doubts they still have for discussion until they truly understand and then accept them. And the latter should first engage in profound self-criticism when refuting others' opinions.

    Those who hold the third attitude are a minority among a minority in the movement. They are performing the act of "passing the test." They have more or less performed in previous political movements and are now preparing to "slip through" again. This attitude is a petty-bourgeois hypocrisy, a way of burying their own future. They can never control their own destiny; once the storm rises, they are in danger of capsizing.

    "Passing the socialist test," whether genuinely or falsely, slowly or quickly, depends entirely on oneself. We hope that they can all recognize the opportunity, pass this socialist test well, and contribute more to the people and to socialism!

    “过关”种种
    金文
    目前知识分子的思想改造，正在大破大立地热烈开展。有人说，这是“过社会主义的关”，“这一关难过”。的确，如果不愿决心丢掉资产阶级丑恶思想的人，确乎是不容易“过关”的。不是有人“躺倒”，有人“请假”，有人“称病”吗？正在“过关”的，也有三种态度。第一种态度是真过，第二种态度是半真半假地过，第三种却是假过。
    持第一种态度的人，是真正愿意葬送资产阶级思想，真的想迎接社会主义思想的人。他们痛下决心，充分理智，决心改造自己。当同志们的大字报还没有提到他的时候，他先自我暴露。在交心会或辩论会上，同志们给他提了最近的事，他联系到过去；给他提了片断的，他考虑到了全面的；给他提了现象，他尽可能分析到本质。他认识不到的，经过实事求是的辩论，是什么就承认什么。任何尖锐的批评，他都平心静气地考虑。有的意见不完全正确或不正确，他考虑的是对方的治病救人的愿望。他也经历了痛苦的过程，但这过程并不长。他们是在真心诚意地实事求是地“过关”。
    持第二种态度的人，虽则也想真正改造自己，但因缺乏实事求是的科学态度，就成了半真半假。有的人是“包下来”，有的人是“走弯路”。“包下来”是别人说什么他都承认，甚至在自我检查时给自己戴的“帽子”，比别人批判的多而大。因此，“关”过了，思想包袱还没有完全丢掉。“走弯路”却是同“包下来”相反。他们承认一些；保留一些，还有些强调了客观原因，甚至不该否定的也找理由否定一些。这两种人，总的看来，态度是诚恳的，自我斗争也很剧烈。问题在于，前者应当在自我检讨之余，把自己还有怀疑的问题提出来讨论，直到真正认识了再接受。而后者应当在反驳别人意见的时候，先作深刻的自我批评。
    持第三种态度的人，是在运动中少数人中的少数。他们是在作“过关”的表演。他们在历次政治运动中都是或多或少地表演过来的，现在又准备“滑过去”。这种态度是市侩的虚伪态度，是葬送自己前途的做法。他们绝对不能掌握自己的命运，一旦风浪起来，就有翻船的危险。
    “过社会主义的关”，或真或假，或慢或快，完全取决于自己。我们希望他们都能够认识时机，过好社会主义这一关，为人民、为社会主义多尽一分力，多发一分热！
