Northeast of Dimitrovgrad, Bulgaria, the soil is fertile, the produce is abundant, and the villages are one after another. But in the past, no one thought that the real wealth was buried under this black, oily soil. People used to dig up brownish, layered, soft coal when digging wells, but they didn't know how to use it. Farmers still collected wood, corn stalks, and dried cow dung for heating.

The new era has arrived. Several years of exploration have proven that Bulgaria has no brown coal mine as large as this one. The coal seam is up to twenty meters thick and is distributed under 300,000 decares (one decare equals 1.5 Chinese mu) of land. The currently verified reserves have reached 3 billion tons.

However, wealth is not easy to obtain, because there are one hundred meters of clay and gravel above the coal seam. Five years ago, the first group of workers came here. Now, a large pit has appeared on the plain, with steps built on the edge of the pit, and machines are digging the earth on it. Before 1960, 8.5 million cubic meters of soil had to be removed. If this soil were loaded into carts and lined up, it could stretch from Bulgaria to China!

Now, the preparation work for the "Maritsa-East" coal mine is in full swing. Many workers and machines are busy on the huge construction site. German experts are assisting in the installation of two rotary excavators imported from the German Democratic Republic. Each rotary excavator is equivalent to the labor of one thousand coal miners. In 1960, this largest coal mine in Southeastern Europe will begin production. In the future, this mine will produce more than 10 million tons of coal annually, which is equivalent to the total output of all Bulgarian mines now.

Not long ago, the preparatory work for the "Maritsa-East" thermal power plant project also began. It will be the largest thermal power plant in the Balkan Peninsula, with a generating capacity of 300,000 kilowatts, which is more than twice the total generating capacity of Bulgaria before September 9, 1944. In the future, the generating capacity of this power plant can be increased to 600,000 kilowatts, which is equal to the generating capacity of the largest thermal power plant in Europe. In 1960, this power plant will begin to transmit electricity.

In a few years, the "Maritsa-East" integrated engineering area will become the largest industrial center in Bulgaria. (Fang)

    保加利亚最大的建设工程
    保加利亚季米特洛夫格勒的东北一带，土壤肥沃，物产丰富，村庄一个接着一个。可是过去谁也没想到，真正的财富却在这黑油油的土地下埋藏着。从前这里的人打井时，从地下挖出过褐色层状的松软的煤块，可是都不懂得用它。农民还是收集木材、玉米秸和干牛粪来取暖。
    新时代来了。几年的勘探结果证明，保加利亚还没有像这样大的褐煤矿。煤层厚达二十公尺，分布在三十万狄卡尔（一狄卡尔合我国一亩半）土地下。现在查清的蕴藏量已达三十亿吨。
    可是，财富并不是轻而易举可以得到的，因为在煤层上面有一百公尺厚的粘土和砂石。五年前，第一批工人来到了这里。现在，平原上已出现一个大深坑，坑边筑成台阶，机器在上面挖土。1960年以前，还要挖掉八百五十万立方公尺的土，如果把这些土装在小车里排起来的话，可以从保加利亚排到中国！
    现在这个“马里查—东”煤矿的开采准备工作正在紧张地进行。许多工人和机器在巨大的建设工地上忙碌着。德国专家正在协助安装从德意志民主共和国进口的两台回转挖煤机。每台回转挖煤机等于一千个挖煤工人的劳动。1960年这个东南欧最大的煤矿就要开始生产了。将来，这个矿每年将产一千多万吨煤，相当于保加利亚现在所有矿井的总产量。
    不久以前，“马里查—东”热电站工程的准备工作也已开始。它将是巴尔干半岛上最大的热电站，发电量为三十万瓩，比1944年9月9日以前保加利亚全国总发电量还多两倍。将来，这个发电站的发电量可以增加到六十万瓩，同欧洲最大的热电站的发电量相等。1960年，这个发电站就要开始送电。
    几年以后，“马里查—东”综合工程地区将成为保加利亚最大的工业中心。　（方）
