Let's All Sing New Songs of the Great Leap Forward
Wang Jing

Recently, the Art Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Culture and the Chinese Musicians Association selected twenty songs popular from various places and compiled them into "Selected New Songs of the Great Leap Forward" for publication and recommendation to the whole country, which is of great significance for further carrying out the socialist singing movement.

Most of these twenty songs are short, concise, and suitable for the general public to sing. This song form seems simple, but it is actually very difficult to write well. It requires the writer to convey the voices from the bottom of the hearts of the broad masses, which must be expressed in the most concentrated and refined image-based language. These twenty songs have mostly achieved this to varying degrees, which cannot be said to be a gratifying achievement.

In order to better illustrate this achievement, let us briefly review. This musical form, commonly known as "mass songs," occupies an important position in the development history of new music in our country. Especially since Nie Er, the works of Mai Xin, Zhang Shu, Xian Xinghai, He Luting, Lü Ji, etc., have all reflected the characteristics of the times like a mirror, represented the people's wishes, and inspired the people's fighting will. Like "March of the Volunteers," "The Broadsword March," "Strong Men to the Front," "On the Taihang Mountains," "Guerrilla Song," "Opening Up Wasteland"... these works that we call "songs of national salvation" and "songs of the War of Resistance" all reflect some of the characteristics of that era of profound disasters and fierce battles: in order to defeat the powerful enemy, people's indignant shouts and calls, overcoming huge difficulties and sacrifices, thus the tunes are full of indignant, heroic, and common-enemy emotions, full of high-spirited fighting will and confidence in victory.

After the national liberation, the situation changed, and the people established national power. At this time, we sang: "People of the World Are of One Mind," "Ode to the Motherland," "March of the Chinese People's Volunteers"... These songs inherit the fighting spirit and optimism of past revolutionary songs, but also highlight the heroic and magnificent tones, reflecting the joy of the people being masters of their own country after liberation, and showing our pride in the powerful motherland and the world's peaceful and democratic forces.

When our country completed the transformation of socialist ownership and entered a new historical period of the Five-Year Plan, the people were enthusiastic and vigorously completed the basic tasks of the socialist revolution. However, the work of musicians was obviously lagging behind. In the past three or four years, there was a lack of sufficient combat songs with the characteristics of the times, and some composers were too obsessed with themes like "Girls of ×××". Even during the rampant attacks of the rightists, yellow songs were rampant in some areas for a time. The people continued to express dissatisfaction with the composers and put forward the legitimate demand for good songs to sing. After the vigorous rectification movement and anti-rightist struggle last year, a great revolution in ideology was carried out, a new revolutionary upsurge of leap forward after leap forward, and advanced catching up with advanced has arrived. This time, the musicians did not disappoint the people's expectations. They caught up with the tide of the times, formulated their own Great Leap Forward plans, and wrote some songs loved by the masses. This is welcome.

The masses welcome these songs, first of all, because the songs say what they want to say. You hear: "Socialism is good, the people's status in socialist countries is high. Reactionaries are overthrown, imperialism runs away with its tail between its legs... The people's Jiangshan is firmly seated, and rightists can't rebel even if they want to"; "Great Leap Forward, Great Leap Forward, let's compare who comes first, the plan set yesterday must be doubled today... It won't take fifteen years to catch up with England"; "Split open ten thousand mountains, pave a smooth road, the back waves push the front waves, and the high tide follows the high tide"... These vividly depict the new atmosphere of the whole country unanimously building socialism and express the people's enthusiasm and wishes. The composers also expressed these with corresponding musical images. For example, in "Socialism is Good," the composer uses short sentences, bouncing rhythms, and smooth folk-song-style melodies to express a kind of jubilant and confident emotion. This is precisely the image of the people of our time, who, after achieving victory through numerous struggles, are singing and moving forward like an unstoppable wave. Other songs, such as "Riding the Wind and Waves, Great Leap Forward," "Great Leap Forward Parade Song," "Song of Young Workers," and "Sing the Songs of Victory," although written by different writers, share the same characteristics of being cheerful, lively, and concise. This is certainly not a coincidence, but the result of the composers' common feeling of the pulse of the times. Of course, to say that these songs have the characteristics of the times does not mean that they have summarized the whole picture of the spirit of the times. Our life is infinitely rich, and the spiritual outlook of the people is also broad and huge. Therefore, some songs, such as "Revolutionary People" and "The East Wind Prevails Over the West Wind," where composers adopt a solemn ode style, or a relatively majestic march style, to express the noble character of revolutionaries and the strong power of the world's socialist camp, are also what we need and feel very close to.

The national style of these songs is very distinct, which also inherits the tradition of revolutionary mass songs in our country. Of course, the national style is not a narrow frame, nor can it be used as a fixed standard by a certain work. This is due to the theme expressed in the work, the composer's absorption of tones in real life and tones in traditional music, and there are various possible forms of expression. This is also a problem that has been confirmed by our past creative practice. For example, Nie Er's "The Road Song," "Road Opener," and "Dance of the Golden Snake" all express the national style with various different techniques. The twenty songs in front of us are also like this. For example, the songs "Four Seasons Wind" and "Singing the Forty Articles of the Agricultural Program" clearly show the connection with the original folk song tunes, while songs like "The Song of the Great Leap Forward Shakes the Mountains and Rivers" and "Socialism is Good" are difficult to hear similar to a certain fixed folk song, but they are also very kind and moving. As for songs like "Launching a Revolutionary Competition," "Great Leap Forward," and "Tree Planting Song," which absorb many new factors, but are still connected to the tradition of national music and revolutionary songs, we do not feel out of place when we listen to them. In short, our requirements for national style, under the principles of inheriting tradition, being faithful to life, and striving to be popular with the masses, make it have a rich and diverse expression form, which is of great benefit to the prosperity of creation.

Among the authors of these songs, we see more experienced composers, such as Huan Zhi, Qu Xixian, Wang Xin, Tang He, Zhang Wengang, and An Bo and Meng Bo, who do not create much due to work reasons. Their works have their own personal artistic styles, and their skills are relatively mature. In particular, it is very gratifying for "old writers" who have put down their pens for a long time and have not published many works to pick up their pens again to compose new songs of the Great Leap Forward. At the same time, there are also newcomers and younger composers who have not published much work in the past, and most of the new songs are from them. In this collection of songs, we see some composers such as Cheng Dun, Er Dengge, Wang Shiyi, Gu Yi, Cheng Yi, Qiao Dongjun, etc., who have all demonstrated their respective talents in their works. This shows that our creative team is expanding and improving, which is also very gratifying and congratulatory.

We are happy for the achievements of the composers in the Great Leap Forward. Of course, this is only a preliminary harvest, and it does not mean that there are no shortcomings and problems. For example, in the inheritance and development of traditional music, the foundation is not wide enough or deep enough, and the creation of new musical language is not bold enough, and these two are not opposed to each other. The use of this important form of mass songs is not creative enough, so singers still feel somewhat monotonous. We hope that the composers will continue to write more works with higher quantity and quality.

Works are a central link in promoting the movement. Although there have been these achievements, it is still far from enough for the needs of the masses. Since the Great Leap Forward, the people of the whole country have been in high spirits and eagerly demanded to sing. Many agricultural cooperatives in many regions have generally established singing teams, and many provinces and cities have even set targets. For example, Kunming's 150,000-person three-song movement, the Communist Youth League Committee of Dongsi District in Beijing proposed that 95% of young people learn five songs before May 1st, and Shanxi Province proposed that one-third of the province's population participate in the singing movement and cultivate 300,000 "Li Youcais" and 300,000 "Guo Lan'yings" within one year. For example, Shenyang City developed 30 elderly women's and elderly men's choirs in a very short period of time (there was only one originally)... These all show how enthusiastic the masses are and how urgent the needs are. In addition, many professional groups have further strengthened their ties with the masses and strengthened popularization work after rectification, just as a worker praised the comrades sent by professional groups to teach songs: "In the past, we had to spend more than a yuan to see them from afar, but now they can come to our factory..." This is undoubtedly one of the powerful guarantees for carrying out the socialist singing movement. From the current situation, there is a great momentum of "everything is ready, only the east wind is lacking"; the "east wind" is more mass songs with better quantity and quality. Poets and composers, on the basis of the valuable existing foundation, leap forward, and leap forward again!

    大家都来唱跃进新歌
    王竞
    最近文化部艺术事业管理局和中国音乐家协会从各地流行的歌曲中选出了二十首编成“跃进新歌选”出版，并向全国推荐，这对于进一步开展社会主义的歌咏运动有着重要的意义。
    这二十首歌曲，大都是短小、精悍，适于广大群众歌唱。这种歌曲体裁，看来简单，其实要写得好很不容易。它需要作家传达出广大群众发自心底的呼声，而这又必须以最集中、最洗练的形象化的语言表现出来。这二十首歌曲，大都在不同的程度上做到了这一点，这不能不说是可喜的收获。
    为了更好地说明这种收获，让我们稍作回顾。这种通常被称为“群众歌曲”的音乐体裁，在我国新音乐的发展历史中是占有重要地位的。特别自聂耳以后，在麦新、张曙、星海、贺绿汀、吕骥等的作品中，都像镜子一样地反映着时代的特点，代表人民的愿望并且鼓舞着人民的斗争意志。像“义勇军进行曲”、“大刀进行曲”、“壮丁上前线”、“在太行山上”、
  “游击队歌”、“开荒”…… ，这些被我们称作“救亡歌曲”和“抗战歌曲”的作品都反映着在那灾难深重、战斗激烈的历史年代的一些特点：为了战胜强大的敌人，人们激愤的呼喊、号召，克服着巨大的困难和牺牲，因此曲调中饱含着激愤壮烈、同仇敌忾的情绪，充满着昂扬的战斗意志和胜利信心。
    全国解放以后，形势变了，人民建立了全国政权。这时我们唱着：“全世界人民心一条”、“歌唱祖国”、“中国人民志愿军战歌”……。这些歌，继承着过去革命歌曲战斗性和乐观主义的传统，但又突现出那豪迈、壮阔的音调，它反映着人民在解放后当家作主的喜悦情绪，表现出我们对强大的祖国和世界和平民主力量的自豪。
    当我国完成了社会主义所有制的改变，进入五年计划的新的历史时期，人民热情蓬勃，出色地完成了社会主义革命的基本任务。但音乐家们的工作显然是落后了，过去三四年中，缺少足够的具有时代特征的战斗性歌曲，有些作曲家过多地迷恋于“×××的姑娘”这一类的题材。甚至在右派猖狂进攻时期，有些地区黄色歌曲一时泛滥成灾。人民不断向作曲家表示不满，提出要好歌子唱的正当要求。经过了去年轰轰烈烈的整风运动和反右斗争，进行了意识形态上的大革命，跃进再跃进，先进赶先进，一个新的革命高潮来临了。这次，音乐家们没有辜负人民的期望，他们赶上这时代的浪潮，纷纷订立自己的跃进计划，写出了一些为群众喜爱的歌曲。这是值得欢迎的。
    群众欢迎这些歌，首先就是因为歌曲中说出了他们要说的话。你听：“社会主义好，社会主义国家人民地位高。反动派，被打倒，帝国主义夹着尾巴逃跑了……人民江山坐得牢，右派分子想反也反不了”；“大跃进来大跃进，比一比来谁当先，昨天订的计划今天要翻一翻……赶上英国用不了十五年”；“劈开万重山，铺平阳关道，后浪催前浪，高潮接高潮”……这些都生动地描绘出举国一致建设社会主义的新气象，表达了人民的热情和愿望。作曲家们也以相应的音乐形象把这些表现了出来。例如“社会主义好”，作曲家以简短的句法、跳荡的节奏、流畅的民歌风格的旋律表现出一种欢腾、自信的情绪，这正是我们这个时代的人民，在经过重重斗争取得了胜利后，像不可抑止的浪潮一样高歌前进的形象。其他几首歌曲，例如“乘风破浪大跃进”，“大跃进游行歌”，“青年工人之歌”，“胜利歌儿唱起来”等，虽然出自不同作家之手，但是那种欢畅、明快、练达的特征却是共同的。这当然不是什么偶合，而是作曲家们共同地感受这时代的脉搏的结果。自然，说这几首歌曲具有时代的特征并不意味着它们已经概括了时代精神的全貌。我们的生活是无比丰富，人民的精神面貌也是广阔巨大的，因此，有些歌曲例如“革命人”，“东风压倒西风”等，作曲家采用庄严的颂歌风格，或是采用比较雄浑的进行曲风格，用来表现革命者的崇高品格和世界社会主义阵营的强大力量，这些也都是为我们所需要和感到非常亲切的。
    这些歌曲的民族风格非常鲜明，这也是继承了我国革命群众歌曲的传统的。自然，民族风格不是一个狭窄的框子，也不能以某一首作品作为固定的标准，这是因作品所表现的主题，作曲家对现实生活中的音调与传统音乐中的音调吸收的情况如何而有各种可能的表现形式的。这也是被我们过去的创作实践所证实了的问题。例如聂耳的“大路歌”、“开路先锋”、“金蛇狂舞”等作品都以各种不同的手法表现了民族风格。在我们面前的这二十首歌曲也还是这样。例如“四季风”“歌唱农业纲要四十条”等曲可以听得出与原有民歌曲调的显明的联系，而像“大跃进的歌声震山河”“社会主义好”这一类的歌曲，很难听出与某一首固定民歌相似，但也非常亲切动人。至于像“掀起革命大竞赛”，“大跃进”，“植树歌”等曲吸收了许多新的因素，但还是联系着民族音乐和革命歌曲的传统，我们听来也并不觉得格格不入。总之，我们对于民族风格的要求，在继承传统、忠实生活与力求群众喜闻乐见的原则下，使之具有丰富多样的表现形式，这对于繁荣创作是有极大好处的。
    在这些歌曲的作者中，我们看到较有经验的作曲家，如焕之、瞿希贤、王莘、唐呵、张文纲，和由于工作关系创作活动不多的安波、孟波等，他们的作品都有自己个人的艺术风格，技巧也比较成熟，特别是搁笔久、发表作品不多的“老作家”重新执笔谱写跃进的新曲，这是非常可喜的事。同时也有过去发表作品不多的新手和较年轻的作曲家涌现，大部分的新歌都是出自他们之手。在这本歌集中我们所看到的一些作曲家如成敦、鄂尔登格、王世一、顾翌、成毅、乔东君等，他们在作品中都表现了各自的才能。这说明了我们创作的队伍在扩大，在提高，这也是非常可喜可贺的事。
    我们为作曲家们在大跃进中的成就而高兴，自然，这只是初步的收获，并不是说已经没有了缺点和问题。比如，在对传统音乐的继承、发展上，基础还不够广泛，不够深入，对新的音乐语言的创造上也不够大胆，而这两者并不是对立的。对群众歌曲这种重要体裁的运用，发挥创造性也不够，因之使得歌唱者多少还有些千篇一律的感觉。我们希望作曲家们继续写出数量更多、水平更高的作品来。
    作品是推动运动的一个中心环节，目前虽然已经有了这些成果，但对群众需要来说还是非常不够的。大跃进以来，全国人民情绪高涨，迫切要求唱歌，许多地区的农业合作社普遍成立了歌咏队，许多省市甚至订出了指标。如昆明的十五万人三歌运动，北京东四区共青团团委会提出95％的青年在“五一”前学会五支歌，山西省提出要全省三分之一的人口参加歌唱运动，一年内培养出三十万个“李有才”和三十万个“郭兰英”。再如沈阳市在很短时间内发展了三十个老大娘和老大爷的合唱团（原来只有一个）……这些都说明了群众的情绪是多么热烈，需要是多么迫切。此外，许多专业团体经过整改后更进一步地加强了与群众的联系，加强了普及工作，正如一个工人称赞专业团体派来教歌的同志时所说的：“过去我们要花一块多钱才能隔很远看他们一眼，现在他们可到我们厂里来了……”这无疑也是开展社会主义歌咏运动的有力保证之一。从现在形势来看，大有“万事俱备，只欠东风”之势；“东风”就是数量更多、质量更好的群众歌曲。诗人和作曲家们在可贵的现有基础上，跃进，再跃进吧！
