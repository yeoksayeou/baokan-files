    "Leap Forward" Steam Boiler
    Workers at the state-owned Northeast Machinery Manufacturing Plant successfully trial-produced a "Leap Forward" steam boiler for rural irrigation in just five days at the beginning of this month.
    This boiler is small in size, highly efficient, and easy to use. The entire boiler has a volume of only 1.8 cubic meters, but its power is ten horsepower. It is also very economical in coal consumption, requiring only 40 kilograms per hour. Using such a boiler to power a water pump can irrigate more than 400 mu of paddy fields per day.

    “跃进号”蒸汽锅炉
    国营东北机器制造厂职工在本月初只用五天时间就试制成功了一种供农村灌溉用的“跃进号”蒸汽锅炉。
    这种锅炉体积小、效能大、使用方便。整个锅炉体积只有一点八立方公尺，但功率只有十马力。用煤也很省，每小时只需四十公斤。用一台这样的锅炉来发动水泵，每天可以灌溉四百多亩水田。
