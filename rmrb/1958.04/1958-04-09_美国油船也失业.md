Xinhua News Agency, 8th, New York dispatch: A large number of American tankers are idle due to lack of cargo. According to a recent survey report released by the American shipping industry, there are currently 299 American tankers laid up, with a total tonnage of 4.6 million tons. Compared with the number in the shipping industry's survey report in February, this is an increase of 17%.

The survey report also said that the situation may worsen.

This is a group of unemployed American workers. It can be seen how anxious and angry they are about their unfortunate situation. (Originally published in the American "People's World")
