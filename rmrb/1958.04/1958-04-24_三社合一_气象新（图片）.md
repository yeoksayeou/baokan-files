    New Look of "Three Cooperatives Merged into One"
    After the Jinchuan Agricultural Cooperative in Wushan County, Gansu Province, implemented the "Three Cooperatives Merged into One" (meaning that the supply and marketing cooperative and the credit cooperative are placed under the leadership of the agricultural cooperative), it greatly facilitated the peasants due to unified leadership and clear goals. The "market trip" time saved by this cooperative alone amounts to 14,832 labor days per year.

    “三社合一”气象新
    甘肃省武山县金川农业社实行“三社合一”（即供销社、信用社划归农业社领导）后，由于领导统一、目标明确，大大便利了农民。仅这个社因此而节省的“赶集”时间，每年就有一万四千八百三十二个劳动日。
