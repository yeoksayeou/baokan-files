The cultural and educational fronts have been continuously reporting good news in recent months. Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture and other places have basically eliminated illiteracy, Henan and other places have popularized primary school education, Henan and Jiangsu are vigorously developing people-run agricultural middle schools, and Nanjing and Panyu County have established colleges; while in Tianmen County, Hubei Province, every village has cultural and technical night schools, and every commune has clubs, and mass cultural and entertainment activities in Shanxi and Yunnan are quite prosperous. This is a gratifying phenomenon, indicating that after the great leap forward in production, there will inevitably be a great leap forward in culture and education, and a climax of China's cultural revolution is approaching.

Without culture and technology, it is impossible to build socialism, and without culture and technology, it is impossible to build a new socialist countryside. The great leap forward in industrial and agricultural production must be matched by a great leap forward in culture and education. The great movement of technological innovation in industrial and agricultural production will surely arouse a great movement of mass learning of culture and technology. The technological revolution of reforming old farm tools and changing manual operation to mechanization or semi-mechanization will also arouse the demand for eliminating illiteracy and popularizing primary and secondary schools. Without a climax of the cultural revolution, it would be difficult to quickly meet the urgent needs of the broad masses of farmers. The good news from the cultural and educational front is precisely the bud of the cultural revolution. Culture and education are the superstructure, and must serve the economic base. The most important reason why Xiaomiao Township in Tianmen County can develop and consolidate clubs, develop and consolidate cultural and technical night schools is that it is closely integrated with production. A ballad circulating in this township is the best explanation. The ballad says: "When culture and technology blossom, cotton production greatly increases; labor spreads across the fields, and songs and dances fill the village; in the daytime, we are farmers, and at night, we enter school; with enthusiasm and diligence, the leap forward is guaranteed."

Of course, there is also a struggle between two lines in the development of culture and education. One line is to fully trust the masses, rely on the masses, mobilize the masses, and develop the culture and education undertakings needed by the masses in a faster, better, and more economical way; the other line is not to believe the masses, dare not mobilize the masses, and develop so-called "regularized" culture and education undertakings in a slower, worse, and more expensive way. The former line is the Marxist line. It is both practical and in line with the requirements of the masses, and can quickly promote the development of culture and education and set off a climax of the cultural revolution. The latter line is an anti-Marxist or capitalist line. It deviates from reality and violates the requirements of the masses, slowly dragging back the development of culture and education, and hindering the development of socialist culture and education. We advocate the former line and oppose the latter line.

In the "Report on an Investigation of the Peasant Movement in Hunan" written by Comrade Mao Zedong thirty-one years ago, he enthusiastically praised the revolutionary movement of the peasants in Hunan. Among the fourteen major events, he wrote about the "Cultural Movement" as a major event. It proves that the peasant masses urgently need culture and education, and that they themselves have the enthusiasm to create the schools they need; it also proves that the so-called "regularized" schools are rejected by the peasants. Now, let us copy this section of Chairman Mao's article below as our motto for running cultural and educational undertakings. We wish the Marxist line a great victory, so that the buds of the cultural revolution can grow strong, blossom everywhere in a riot of color, and bear the glorious fruits of a new socialist culture!

Comrade Mao Zedong's article wrote: In China, only landlords have had culture, and peasants have had no culture. However, the culture of the landlords was created by the peasants, because the things that created the landlord's culture were none other than the blood and sweat plundered from the peasants. In China, 90% of the people have not received cultural education, and the vast majority of them are peasants. Once the landlord forces in the countryside are overthrown, the peasant cultural movement begins. Just look at how the peasants have always hated schools, but now they are working hard to run night schools. The peasants have always disliked "foreign schools." When I was a student, I went back to my hometown and saw the peasants opposing "foreign schools," and I also breathed with the general "foreign students" and "foreign teachers," and stood on the side of the foreign schools, and always felt that the peasants were somewhat wrong. In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, I lived in the countryside for half a year. At this time, I was a Communist Party member and had a Marxist point of view, and I realized that I was wrong and that the peasants were right. The textbooks of rural primary schools are full of urban things and do not meet the needs of the countryside. The attitude of primary school teachers towards peasants is also very bad. Not only are they not the helpers of the peasants, but they have become people who are hated by the peasants. Therefore, the peasants would rather welcome private schools (they call them "Han schools") than schools (they call them "foreign schools"), and they would rather welcome private school teachers than primary school teachers. Now they are running night schools in a big way, calling them peasant schools. Some have already been established, and some are being prepared, with an average of one school per township. They are very enthusiastic about opening such schools, believing that such schools are their own. The expenses for night schools are drawn from superstitious public funds, ancestral hall public funds, and other idle public properties. If the county education bureau takes these public funds to run national schools, that is, the "foreign schools" that do not meet the needs of the peasants, the peasants want to take them to run peasant schools. After the dispute, each gets a certain amount, and in some places, the peasants get all of them. As a result of the development of the peasant movement, the cultural level of the peasants has been rapidly improved. In a short period of time, tens of thousands of schools will emerge in the countryside throughout the province, unlike the intellectuals and so-called "educators," who only call for "universal education," and after calling for it, it is still just empty talk.

    文化革命的萌芽
    若波
    近月来，文教战线不断传来捷报。延边朝鲜族自治州等地已经基本扫除文盲，河南等地已经普及小学教育，河南和江苏等地都在大力发展民办农业中学，南京市和番禺县都办了大专学校；而在湖北天门县等地已经村村有文化技术夜校，社社有俱乐部，山西和云南等地群众性的文化娱乐活动相当繁荣。这是可喜的现象，表明了生产大跃进之后，必然会出现文化教育大跃进，我国的文化革命高潮已经临近了。
    缺乏文化技术不能建设社会主义，缺乏文化技术也不能建设社会主义的新农村。工农业生产的大跃进，一定要有文化教育的大跃进相配合。工农业生产中掀起了技术革新的大运动，一定会引起群众学习文化技术的大运动。改革旧农具、改变手工操作为机械化或半机械化的技术革命，也一定会引起消灭文盲和普及中、小学的要求。而如果没有一个文化革命的高潮，就很难迅速地满足广大农民的迫切需要。目前各地传来的文化教育战线的捷报，正是文化革命的萌芽。文化教育是上层建筑，一定要为经济基础服务。天门县小庙乡之所以能够发展和巩固俱乐部、发展和巩固文化技术夜校，最主要的是密切结合了生产。这个乡流传的一首歌谣是最好的说明。这首歌谣说：“文化技术开了花，棉花产量大高涨；劳动遍田野，歌舞满村庄；白天是庄稼汉，夜来进学校；干劲加钻劲，跃进有保障”。
    当然，在发展文化教育事业上，也有着两条路线的斗争。一条路线是充分相信群众，依靠群众，发动群众，多快好省地办起群众所需要的文化教育事业；一条路线是不相信群众，不敢发动群众，少慢差费地办所谓“正规化”的文化教育事业。前一条路线是马克思主义的路线。它既能够切合实际，也符合群众要求，能迅速地推动文化教育事业的发展，掀起文化革命运动的高潮。后一条路线是反马克思主义或是资本主义的路线。它脱离实际地违背群众的要求，慢腾腾地拖住文化教育事业的后腿，阻碍了社会主义的文化教育事业的发展。我们倡导的是前一条路线，反对的是后一条路线。
    毛泽东同志在三十一年前所写的“湖南农民运动考察报告”中，热情洋溢地赞扬湖南农民的革命运动。在十四件大事中写有“文化运动”这一件大事。证明农民群众迫切需要文化教育，而他们自己有热情来创办自己所需要的学校；也证明所谓“正规化”的学校，却为农民所厌弃。现在把毛主席的这一节文章抄在下面，作为办文化教育事业的座右铭。我们预祝马克思主义路线获得巨大胜利，让文化革命的萌芽，茁壮成长，万紫千红地遍地开花，结出光辉灿烂的社会主义新文化之果！
    毛泽东同志的文章写道：中国历来只是地主有文化，农民没有文化。可是地主的文化是由农民造成的，因为造成地主文化的东西，不是别的，正是从农民身上掠取的血汗。中国有90％未受文化教育的人民，这个里面，最大多数是农民。农村里地主势力一倒，农民的文化运动便开始了。试看农民一向痛恶学校，如今却在努力办夜学。“洋学堂”，农民是一向看不惯的。我从前做学生时，回乡看见农民反对“洋学堂”，也和一般“洋学生”、“洋教习”一鼻孔出气，站在洋学堂的利益上面，总觉得农民未免有些不对。民国十四年在乡下住了半年，这时我是一个共产党员，有了马克思主义的观点，方才明白我是错了，农民的道理是对的。乡村小学校的教材，完全说些城里的东西，不合农村的需要。小学教师对待农民的态度又非常之不好，不但不是农民的帮助者，反而变成了农民所讨厌的人。故农民宁欢迎私塾（他们叫“汉学”），不欢迎学校（他们叫“洋学”），宁欢迎私塾老师，不欢迎小学教员。如今他们却大办其夜学，名之曰农民学校。有些已经举办，有些正在筹备，平均每乡有一所。他们非常热心开办这种学校，认为这样的学校才是他们自己的。夜学经费，提取迷信公款、祠堂公款及其他闲公闲产。这些公款，县教育局要提了办国民学校即是那不合农民需要的“洋学堂”，农民要提了办农民学校，争议结果，各得若干，有些地方是农民全得了。农民运动发展的结果，农民的文化程度迅速地提高了。不久的时间内，全省当有几万所学校在乡村中涌出来，不若知识阶级和所谓“教育家”者流，空唤“普及教育”，唤来唤去还是一句废话。
