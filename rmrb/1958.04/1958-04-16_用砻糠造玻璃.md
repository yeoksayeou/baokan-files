The Wufeng Lubricating Oil Factory in Changzhou, Jiangsu Province, has successfully made glass from rice husks (paddy husks), and it will be put into production in early May. The Wufeng Lubricating Oil Factory bakes the rice husks in a large iron bucket to turn them into black husk charcoal. The husk charcoal is then calcined at high temperature to become quartz powder, the raw material for making glass. The glass made from rice husks is whiter, more transparent, and has better heat resistance than glass made from natural quartz powder. The by-products of rice husk glass production, such as furfural and methanol, are also important industrial raw materials.

    用砻糠造玻璃
    江苏省常州市五丰润油厂用砻糠（稻壳）制玻璃获得成功，5月初就可以投入生产。五丰润油厂将砻糠放在一只大铁桶内焙烧成黑色糠炭，再将糠炭经高温焙烧即成制造玻璃的原料石英粉。用砻糠制造的玻璃比天然石英粉制造的洁白、透明、耐热性能好。砻糠制造玻璃后的副产品糖醛、甲醇等又是工业的重要原料。
