Xinhua News Agency, Moscow, April 16th: The Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union (CPSU), in its congratulatory message to the 13th Congress of the All-Union Lenin Communist Youth League (Komsomol), stated that the Soviet state is now at a new stage in its historical development. The construction of a communist society is now the direct and practical task of the Party and the people. Under these circumstances, the role of the Komsomol in political, economic, and cultural construction, as well as in the entire socio-political life, is further enhanced.

The congratulatory message was read by Kirichenko on the 15th at the Communist Youth League Congress.

The congratulatory message pointed out that the glorious traditions of the Komsomol have been passed down from generation to generation. They enthusiastically respond to the motherland's call to go to the most difficult places, demonstrate initiative and creativity in any work, and follow the Party and act as the Party's loyal and reliable assistant in all aspects.

The congratulatory message pointed out that the strength of the youth should be more resolutely mobilized to fight for the completion of the task put forward by the Party: to overtake some of the largest capitalist countries in the output of the most important products per capita within the next fifteen years.

The CPSU Central Committee believes that the Komsomol will continue to be an active assistant to the Party, assisting the Party in striving for a great leap forward in agriculture, striving to implement measures to further develop the collective farm system and reorganize machine tractor stations, and striving to solve the task of producing abundant grain for the residents in the coming years, abundant raw materials for light industry, and catching up with the United States in the production of meat, milk, and fats per capita.

The congratulatory message said that in modern times, when the communist ideology that has captured the hearts of hundreds of millions of people has become a powerful force for transforming modern society, it is particularly important for young people to study Marxist-Leninist theory in depth and creatively apply the knowledge they have acquired to practical activities. It is necessary to explain to young men and women in depth the significance of the domestic and foreign policies of the Communist Party and the Soviet state, and to help them correctly discern directions in the various complex phenomena of social life. The unprecedented prosperity of Soviet science, technology, and culture requires that young people must constantly study, reach the level of modern knowledge, master the achievements of socialist culture, and be good at tenaciously combining production work with learning.

The congratulatory message pointed out that the great task of building communism and the growing role of the Komsomol in realizing these tasks both require continuous improvement in the work of organizing and educating young people.

The congratulatory message concluded by saying that the mission of the Komsomol is: to educate Soviet youth in the spirit of loyalty to the principles of proletarian internationalism and the friendship of all peoples, to expand and strengthen the ties between Soviet youth and the youth of socialist countries, and with all progressive youth in the world, to unremittingly oppose warmongers and strive to consolidate lasting world peace.

    继承光荣传统作党的忠实助手
    苏共中央祝贺共青团代表大会
    据新华社莫斯科16日电　苏联共产党中央委员会在致苏联列宁共产主义青年团第十三次代表大会的贺词中说，苏维埃国家现在正处在自己历史发展的新阶段。建成共产主义社会现在是党和人民的直接的实际任务。在这种情况下，共青团在政治、经济和文化建设中以及整个社会政治生活中的作用更加提高了。
    这个贺词是基里钦科15日在共青团代表大会上宣读的。
    贺词指出，共青团的光荣传统一代代传了下来，他们热烈地响应祖国的号召到最困难的地方去，在任何工作中都表现出主动精神和创举，各个方面追随党、做党的忠实可靠的助手。
    贺词指出，应当更坚决动员青年的力量，为完成党所提出的任务——在最近十五年内在最重要的产品的按人口平均计算的产量方面赶过一些最大的资本主义国家而斗争。
    苏共中央认为共青团今后仍然是党的积极助手，协助党为争取农业大跃进、争取实现进一步发展集体农庄制度和改组机器拖拉机站的措施、争取解决在今后一些年内为居民生产丰裕的粮食、为轻工业生产丰裕的原料、在按人口计算的肉类、牛奶和油脂的生产方面赶上美国的任务。
    贺词说，在现代，当掌握千千万万人心的共产主义思想成了改造现代社会的、强大的创造力的时候，青年人深入地研究马克思列宁主义理论、把所获得的知识创造性地运用在实际活动中，这点是特别重要的。必须向男女青年深入地解释共产党和苏维埃国家国内外政策的意义，帮助他们在社会生活的各种复杂现象中正确地明辨方向。苏联科学、技术和文化空前的繁荣昌盛，要求青年必须不断地学习，达到现代知识的水平，掌握社会主义文化的成就，善于顽强地把生产工作和学习结合起来。
    贺词指出，建成共产主义的伟大任务和共青团在实现这些任务中的日益增长的作用都要求不断地改进组织青年和教育青年的工作。
    贺词最后说，共青团的使命是：以忠于无产阶级国际主义原则和各国人民友好的精神教育苏联青年，扩大和加强苏联青年同社会主义国家的青年、同世界上全体进步青年的联系，不懈地反对战争贩子、争取巩固和持久的世界和平。
