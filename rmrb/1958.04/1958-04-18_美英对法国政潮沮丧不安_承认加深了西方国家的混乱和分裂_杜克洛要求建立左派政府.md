Xinhua News Agency dispatch: The fall of the Gaillard government in France has caused great shock in Washington, London, and Paris.

    American officials privately stated that the collapse of the French Gaillard government over its North African policy has caused "deep concern" in Washington officialdom.

    Washington officials are worried that this equates to the failure of the US-British mediation mission in the Franco-Tunisian dispute. They are particularly uneasy about the wave of attacks against the United States during the National Assembly debate. They fear this may have an impact on the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Washington officials are also concerned that the French government crisis will affect the coordination of Western countries' pace in negotiations with the Soviet Union.

    A British Foreign Office spokesman expressed "regret" on the 16th over the fall of the French Gaillard government. He believes that this has caused a "setback" to the "efforts" of the United States and Britain to "mediate" the Franco-Tunisian dispute.

    The bourgeois newspapers in London were shocked and frustrated by the fall of the Gaillard government. It is seen as another example of Western confusion and disunity.

    The "Financial Times" published an editorial on the 17th saying that the debate in the French National Assembly on the 15th regarding the government's North African policy mainly showed hatred towards the United States and, to some extent, towards Britain. The newspaper is concerned that this sentiment may harm the unity of the Western alliance.

    In Paris, many bourgeois newspapers, in commenting on the fall of the Gaillard government, emphasized the rise of anti-American sentiment among right-wing parliamentarians. This anti-American sentiment is caused by the United States' attempts to seize France's colonial interests in North Africa.

    "Paris Daily" said that the Gaillard government "had to face an anti-American wave." The newspaper pointed out that the National Center of Independent Farmers abandoned the government because the party believed that "the intolerable American invasion of North Africa must be stopped."

    "Le Parisien Libéré" pointed out with dissatisfaction that France is currently "in a state of relying on the dollar and the pound, which forces successive governments to kowtow to Washington and London." However, the newspaper stubbornly attributes the cause of this situation to the government's lack of power. It calls for the establishment of a government that can better safeguard France's colonial interests, so as to ensure that Algeria, Black Africa, and the underground resources of the Sahara belong to France.

    The French Communist Party's newspaper "L'Humanité," in response to this demand from right-wing newspapers, pointed out that the fall of the Gaillard government once again proves that the insane policy being implemented in Algeria is experiencing increasingly great difficulties. All those who hope for peace should take action to make France's policy conform to the wishes expressed by voters in the 1956 election. The newspaper called on the French people to unite and demand the establishment of a left-wing government.

    Prior to this, French Communist Party Secretary Duclos had a conversation with a reporter from "Combat," putting forward the following suggestions: First, the Socialist Party and the Communist Party should take joint action as in 1936; second, the two parties should carry out organizational work to support the demands of the workers; third, all left-wing forces should unite, and the French Communist Party should rejoin the government.

### 美英对法国政潮沮丧不安  承认加深了西方国家的混乱和分裂  杜克洛要求建立左派政府

    美英对法国政潮沮丧不安
    承认加深了西方国家的混乱和分裂
    杜克洛要求建立左派政府
    本报综合报道　据新华社讯：法国盖伊阿政府的倒台，在华盛顿、伦敦和巴黎引起很大震动。
    美国官员们私下表示，法国盖伊阿政府因为北非政策而垮台一事引起了华盛顿官方的“深切忧虑”。
    华盛顿的官员担心，这等于美英斡旋法、突争端使命的失败。他们特别对国民议会辩论中对美国的一片攻击声表示不安。他们担心这可能在北大西洋集团中产生影响。华盛顿官员们还担心，法国的这次政府危机会影响西方国家在同苏联谈判问题上的步调协调。
    英国外交部发言人16日对法国盖伊阿政府的倒台表示“遗憾”。他认为，这使得美英两国“斡旋”法国—突尼斯纠纷的“努力”受到“挫折”。
    伦敦的资产阶级报纸对盖伊阿政府的倒台感到震惊和沮丧。人们认为，这是西方混乱和不团结的又一例证。
    “金融时报”17日发表社论说，法国国民议会15日就政府的北非政策进行的辩论表现出主要是对美国而部分是对英国的憎恨情绪。这家报纸担心，这种情绪可能损害西方联盟的团结。
    在巴黎方面，许多资产阶级报纸在评论盖伊阿政府倒台的时候着重指出了右翼议员中反美情绪的高涨。这种反美情绪是由于美国要攫夺法国在北非的殖民主义利益而引起的。
    “巴黎日报”说，盖伊阿政府“不得不面对反美浪潮”。这家报纸指出，独立农民全国中心之所以背弃政府，是因为这个政党认为“必须制止令人不能容忍的美国在北非的入侵”。
    “解放了的巴黎人报”不满意地指出，法国目前“处在依靠美元和英镑的状态，这就使得历届政府不得不卑躬屈节地跟着华盛顿和伦敦走”。但是，这家报纸硬把这种情况的成因归咎于政府权力的不够强大。它要求建立一个能够更好地维护法国殖民利益的政府，以便保证阿尔及利亚、黑人非洲和撒哈拉地区的地下富源归法国所有。
    法国共产党机关报“人道报”针对右翼报纸这种要求指出，盖伊阿政府的垮台再一次证明：在阿尔及利亚执行的疯狂政策经历着日益巨大的困难。一切希望和平的人都应该采取行动，以促使法国的政策符合1956年大选时选民表示的愿望。报纸号召法国人民一致起来要求建立左派政府。
    在这以前，法国共产党书记杜克洛曾经向“战斗报”记者发表谈话，提出下列建议：一，社会党和共产党像1936年一样采取联合行动；二，由两党进行组织工作，支持劳动者的要求；三，所有左翼力量都团结起来，法国共产党重新参加政府。
