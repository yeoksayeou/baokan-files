Indicators, Measures, and Drive, All Have Role Models
Zhangpu County Establishes Sixteen Clear Banners
Organizes Masses to Visit and Experiment On-Site, Launches Mutual Teaching and Learning Movement

(Our Dispatch) Our reporter Lei Pu reports: The Zhangpu County Committee of the Chinese Communist Party, under the new situation of the great leap forward in various undertakings, has relatively successfully used a new set of leadership methods. This leadership method is comprehensively called "Everyone grasps typical examples, everything has role models, and every item has demonstrations." That is to say, they have turned "typical examples" into a mass "mutual teaching and learning" movement.

Since last winter, the Zhangpu County Committee has summarized many advanced experiences and put forward sixteen "views" to cadres and the masses: To see how to raise pigs, look at Lu Xi; to see how to build water conservancy projects, look at Da Pu; to see how to improve the soil, look at Ying Shan; to see how to accumulate fertilizer in large quantities, look at Gan Lin; to see how to plant and protect forests, look at Qing Guo; to see how to conserve water and soil, look at Shang Cai; to see health models, look at Xia Tan; to see how to eliminate illiteracy, look at Lin Jiao; to see new-style farm implements, look at Kang Zhuang; to see high rice yields, look at Guan Xun; to see high sweet potato yields, look at Gang Kou; to see high wheat yields, look at Chi Hu; to see high peanut yields, look at Che Ao; to see high sugarcane yields, look at Mei Lin; to see high citrus yields, look at Chang Qiao; to see high fishery yields, look at Xing Zi. For these "typical examples," more than twenty county-wide observation meetings and on-site meetings have been organized, with the participation of about 5,000 people. The method is "on-site visits, on-site experiments, on-site summaries"; the form is a combination of large, medium, and small sizes. In addition to the county committee organizing large-scale activities, townships and communes have also carried out many "inviting in and sending out" and "studying abroad" and other "mutual teaching and learning" movements.

The Zhangpu County Committee has found that adopting this method has these three benefits.

To make the leadership's thinking keep up with the situation and adapt to the requirements of the situation's development, it is necessary to grasp advanced typical examples and use advanced typical examples as "arrows" to shoot at the "targets" of right-leaning thinking. Last year, when the Zhangpu County Committee was drawing up a production increase plan, the initial plan was to increase production by 9.6%. After announcing this to the county committee members, many people couldn't understand it. Some people thought that potential did exist, and increasing production was possible, but climbing the stairs required taking one step at a time. Others believed that production had increased every year, but the plan had never been completed every year, and suggested setting the target lower and completing it higher, so as not to incur empty debts again. At that time, opinions were not unified, and the plan could not be drawn up. What to do? To solve the problem, it was necessary to find a basis. Li Zhenjing, the first secretary of the county committee, and another county committee member went to Gangkou Township and found that using the method of planting sweet potatoes in large ridges with dense planting resulted in the best yield of 15,000 jin per mu, and individual plants weighed up to thirteen jin, which was five or six times higher than the average sweet potato yield per mu. He asked the secretary of the Duxun District Committee and learned that it was not uncommon for local sweet potatoes to yield more than 5,000 jin per mu. After the county committee found a basis, they returned to the county and calculated a large account, proposing to promote 60,000 mu of sweet potatoes planted in large ridges with dense planting. Calculated at an increase of 5,000 jin per mu, that would be 300 million jin of sweet potatoes. Four jin of sweet potatoes could be converted into one jin of rice, which could increase rice production by at least 70 million jin. In this way, the county committee members whose thinking was clear became bolder in the Great Leap Forward; the county committee members who lacked confidence also had a basis for persuasion. The indicator was no longer 9.6%, but soared to 40% in one go, and finally rose to more than 50% for the whole year.

Zhangpu County wants to leap from an average yield of more than 400 jin per mu last year to a "800 jin" county. The county committee members believe that to ensure a complete victory on the agricultural front, it is necessary to simultaneously grasp four links: the leap forward in indicators, the leap forward in measures, the leap forward in thinking, and the even greater leap forward in action. They believe that the main problem in agricultural production at present is slow action, uneven progress in spring plowing, and advanced indicators but backward actions in some areas. The county committee is constantly resolving these contradictions by finding advanced typical examples of action. For example, Dapu Township is a township in Zhangpu that is known for being prone to disasters. This year, it proposed to achieve a "thousand-jin township," but the water conservancy conditions are very bad, and there is a shortage of labor and funds, so the masses have great concerns. In order to mobilize the masses to overcome difficulties, the party branch of this township organized a great leap forward in action and guided the masses to carry out two major debates, one was "Who benefits from building water conservancy?" and the other was "Who should we rely on to build water conservancy?" After the masses' thinking was clear, their enthusiasm came. When there was a shortage of labor, everyone started working early and late, and those who originally carried two baskets of soil carried four baskets, and even six or eight baskets. When there was a shortage of funds, some took out the money they planned to build houses with, and some took out the money they were going to use for marriage. When building water conservancy projects, the sky was overcast, and the water was often so cold at night that it was impossible to get their feet in, but the masses consciously put forward inspiring slogans, called: "The fields are cold, the water is cold, but our hearts are not cold, we will not withdraw until the drought is eliminated," "Heroes fiercely attack the cold water pass, we are not heroes if we don't eliminate the drought," one by one insisted on working in overcast weather, rainy weather, and at night, and fought hard for more than two months. In this way, the enthusiasm of the masses became even greater, and the water conservancy indicators were broken through again and again. The original plan was to repair more than 30 mountain ponds throughout the year, but more than 50 were repaired in less than one winter; the original plan was to eliminate drought in two years, but it was completed in less than one season. In the construction of water conservancy, this township did a very good job of political and ideological work. Many flag raising platforms and blackboards were established on the construction site, as well as field-head big-character posters and field-head debates. The masses on the construction site compiled this year's production increase tasks and enthusiasm into small songs and tunes, singing while working, and the full leap forward action was indescribable in words. The Zhangpu County Committee believes that this township is a typical example of the county's action leap forward, and has organized two observation meetings in a row, and held an on-site meeting there. After Dapu Township's complete set of field-head political work was promoted throughout the county, the county's water conservancy indicators were broken through all at once; the original plan was to eliminate drought on more than 50,000 mu this year, but in early January it rose to 100,000 mu in a row.

Li Zhenjing said that in the past, there was a lot of blindness from the county committee to the district committee. They didn't understand agricultural production, and some cadres didn't even know the seasons of agricultural production. Leading production without understanding production is a major contradiction. This year, not only did the county committee personally go down to create typical examples, but also sent a large number of cadres down to create typical examples. The cadres who remained in the organs also used telephones to understand the situation or went down to "run, look, ask, and talk"; various business departments also came up with a "double package." "Double package" means that each department is responsible for a commune. In this commune, they do both the central work and the business work. According to their experience, doing so not only solves the problem of cadres being both red and expert, but also solves the contradiction between central work and business work.

The county committee also put forward the requirement for all cadres in the county to learn agricultural production technology in the shortest possible time. (Attached picture)

    指标、措施和干劲，样样有榜样
    漳浦县树立十六面鲜明旗帜
    组织群众就地参观、实验，展开互教互学运动
    本报讯　记者雷普报道：中共福建漳浦县委在各项事业大跃进的新形势下，比较出色的运用了一套新的领导方法，这种领导方法综合起来叫做“人人抓典型、事事有榜样、项项有观摩”。就是说，他们把“典型”变成了群众性的“互教互学”运动。
    从去年冬天以来，漳浦县委已经总结了许多先进经验，共向干部和群众提出十六个“看”：养猪圈猪看鹿溪，兴修水利看大埔，改良土壤看英山，大量积肥看甘霖，造林护林看青果，水土保持看上蔡，卫生模范看霞潭，扫除文盲看林脚，新式农具看康庄，水稻丰产看官浔，地瓜丰产看港口，小麦丰产看赤湖，花生丰产看车鳌，甘蔗丰产看梅林，柑桔丰产看长桥，渔业丰产看杏仔。对于这些“典型”，已经组织了全县性的观摩大会和现场会议二十次以上，参加人数达五千人左右。从办法来看是“就地参观，就地实验，就地总结”；形式是大、中、小型相结合，除了县委搞大型的以外，乡与乡、社与社还搞了不少“请进来派出去”、“留学”等“互教互学”运动。
    采用这个方法，漳浦县委体会到有这三个好处。
    要使领导思想赶上形势，适应形势发展的要求，就要抓住先进典型，用先进典型做“矢”射右倾思想的“的”。去年，漳浦县委订增产计划的时候，初步打算增产9.6％，当向县委们宣布以后，很多人都想不通，有的人认为潜力倒有，增产也是可能的，但是爬楼梯也要一步一步才能上去。也有的人认为年年都增产，但年年都完不成计划，提议订的低一点，完成的高一点，不要再负空头债。当时，意见不统一，规划订不下去。怎么办呢？要解决问题就是要找根据。县委第一书记李振经和另一个县委委员到港口乡看了一看，在那里发现采用大畦密植播种地瓜，最好的一亩高产到一万五千斤，个别的一株重量达到十三斤，比一般的地瓜亩产量高出五、六倍。他问了一下杜浔区委书记，知道当地地瓜每亩产五千斤以上的不是少数。县委找到根据以后，回到县里算了一个大账，提出推广六万亩大畦密植地瓜，每亩以增产五千斤计算，就是三亿斤地瓜，四斤地瓜折一斤稻谷，至少可以增产七千万斤稻谷。这样一来，思想通的县委委员大跃进的胆子更壮了；对缺乏信心的县委委员也有了说服的根据。指标不再是9.6％，而是一股劲地上升到40％，到最后上升到全年增产50％以上。
    漳浦县要由去年每亩平均产量四百多斤跃进到“八百斤”县。县委们认为要保证在农业战线上取得全胜，要同时抓住四个环节：指标跃进，措施跃进，思想跃进，行动更要跃进。他们认为，目前农业生产中存在的主要问题是行动迟缓，春耕进度不平衡，某些地区指标先进，行动落后，而县委就是通过找出行动的先进典型不断解决这些矛盾的。像大埔乡，是漳浦出名的多灾乡，今年提出要实现“千斤乡”，但是水利条件很坏，劳力、资金又不足，群众顾虑很大。这个乡的党支部为了发动群众克服困难，组织一个行动大跃进，引导群众开展了两个大辩论，一个是“兴修水利对谁有利？” 另一个是“依靠谁来兴修水利？”当群众思想通了以后，干劲来了。劳力不足，大家起早搭黑干，原来挑两箩筐土的挑到四箩筐，一直到六箩筐、八箩筐。资金不足，有的拿出打算盖房子的钱，有的拿出准备结婚用的钱。兴修水利的时候，天阴，夜间往往水冷得无法下脚，但是群众自觉的提出振奋人心的口号，叫做：“田冷水冷心不冷，不灭旱灾不收兵”、“英雄猛攻冷水关，不灭旱灾非好汉”，一个一个坚持了阴天、雨天、夜间出工，整整苦战了两个多月。这样一来，群众的劲头更大了，兴修水利的指标也一次再一次被突破。原来计划全年修三十多处山塘，还不到一个冬天就修了五十多处；原来计划两年消灭旱灾，还不到一个季节就完成了。这个乡在修水利中，政治思想工作做得非常出色，工地上建立了许多升降旗、黑板报，还有田头大字报、田头辩论会。在工地上的群众把今年的增产任务、干劲都编成小歌小调，一面干一面唱，那种饱满的跃进行动是用笔无法形容的。漳浦县委认为这个乡是全县行动跃进的典型，一连组织了两次观摩，并在那里召开了一次现场会议。大埔乡的一套完整的田头政治工作在全县推广后，全县的兴修水利指标一下被突破；原来只规划今年消灭旱灾五万多亩，到1月初旬连续上升到十万亩。
    李振经说，过去从县委到区委盲目性都很大，不懂得农业生产，有的干部连农业生产的季节也不知道。领导生产，不懂生产，是个大矛盾。今年，不仅县委亲自下去搞典型，而且把大批干部放下去搞典型，留在机关的干部也利用了电话了解情况或者下去“跑一跑、看一看、问一问、讲一讲”；各业务部门也来了个“双包”。“双包”就是各部门都分别包了一个社。在这个社既做好中心工作，又做好业务工作。根据他们的经验，这样做，不但解决了干部又红又专的问题，而且解决了中心工作和业务工作的矛盾。
    县委还向全县干部提出在最短时间内学会农业生产技术的要求。（附图片）
