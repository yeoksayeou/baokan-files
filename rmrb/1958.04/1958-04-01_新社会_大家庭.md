New Society, Big Family
By our reporters Chen Ji and Wen Shuxian

Every Home Sparkling Clean

Amidst a large grove of trees, rows of simple buildings stand neatly arranged. Several thousand families of employees from the Northeast Machinery Manufacturing Plant in Shenyang reside here. One early spring holiday, we visited. Gao Fengqin, the director of the family committee, received us in her home. As soon as we entered her door, we felt a sense of freshness. Everything in the house was very tidy, the furniture was scrubbed and shiny, especially the unpainted floor was very eye-catching. Whether it was the floor of the bedroom, kitchen, or toilet, it was scrubbed so white and shiny, like a cutting board that had just been scraped with a knife; we deliberately touched it with our hands and didn't get any dust. Gao Fengqin told us: Since 1952, every family here has done a good job in cleaning and hygiene, developing the habit of being hygienic, and taking off shoes before entering the house. She also said that other people's floors are scrubbed even cleaner than hers. Later, we visited several other families, and every floor was sparkling clean, and everything was very clean everywhere.

Organized, Comprehensive Mutual Assistance

We were surprised, why could thousands of families maintain such cleanliness for a long time? After further investigation, we found an important reason, which is that the families implemented mutual assistance. In the old society, there was a selfish saying, "Each sweeps the snow from his own doorstep, and cares not for the frost on another's roof"; now the families here do not distinguish between you and me, not only jointly improving the environmental hygiene of public places, but also helping each other with household hygiene. Families who are pregnant, have given birth, or are old and weak, are often helped by their neighbors to tidy up their houses and scrub their floors. Yan Xiuying is in poor health and has no strength to do sanitation work. However, for three or four years, four families have always helped her wipe windows, scrub floors, and wash large pieces of clothing every week, so the sanitary conditions in her home have always been very good.

Here, childbirth, weddings and funerals, cooking, and grocery shopping are all done with mutual assistance. Most of the families of this factory's employees consist of a couple with several children. When a family member gets sick or has a child, the employee has to ask for leave and delay production; if the family member participates in cultural learning and social activities, no one will take care of the children. Therefore, the factory family committee organized all the families in the factory, established hundreds of mutual aid groups with thirty to forty households as a unit, relying on the collective strength of everyone to help each other and solve various difficulties. If you are sick, the families in the mutual aid group will take turns sending you to the hospital, getting medicine for you, helping you cook and take care of your children. If the child is sick, everyone will come to help you. Wang Haixiang's eldest child suffered from scarlet fever, and she accompanied the child to the hospital for thirteen days. A seven- or eight-month-old breastfed baby was left at home and handed over to the mutual aid group. The families in the mutual aid group took turns feeding the baby and putting the baby to sleep. Her husband went to work in the factory as usual without taking a day off. He said, "The mutual aid group really solves problems, the child is well taken care of, I haven't taken care of it for even an hour." If a family member unfortunately passes away, everyone is busy helping her sew funeral clothes and handle funeral affairs. If she leaves behind children who have no one to take care of, the families in the mutual aid group are like mothers, helping the children cook and tidy up the house every day, and sewing cotton clothes and making shoes for them when it gets cold, until the child's father finds someone to take care of them. Technician Tong Wenkui's wife died, leaving behind two children, who were taken care of by the families in the mutual aid group for a winter. Tong Wenkui did not affect his work for a day because of household chores.

Since there have been mutual aid groups, all matters before and after the employee's marriage have been taken care of by the families. Once, young worker Huo Zhaoshan was getting married and prepared to clean up the house himself. When the families found out, they immediately decorated the new house for him, and also sewed quilts for him, picked up the bride, and entertained the guests. He said gratefully, "The families in our factory are really like my relatives. If I don't work hard in production, how can I be worthy of them?" After the new daughter-in-law enters the house, she may not be able to do all the housework. The families in the mutual aid group are also enthusiastic to help the new daughter-in-law learn housework.

115 Nurseries Established Without a Penny from the State

Every family has several children. With children, there are more household chores. Many factory families cannot participate in cultural learning and social activities because they have to take care of their children. However, the families here can participate in various activities no matter how many children they have. The factory family committee adopted the method of mutual assistance, without spending a penny from the state, and established four types of childcare organizations, taking in more than 2,600 children, accounting for more than 90% of the total number of preschool children in the factory, helping families get rid of the burden of children. These four types of childcare organizations were established according to different needs. There are collective temporary nurseries, which take care of the children of families participating in collective activities; there are two-shift temporary nurseries, where families participating in cultural learning take turns taking care of children according to different class times; there are kindergarten classes, which organize nearly a thousand preschool children into twenty-three classes for education. Each class has two or three teachers, who are selected from the families to teach the children in turns. Families who are not highly educated but understand industrial and agricultural labor production teach the children courses on loving labor. Families who like drawing flowers teach the children handicrafts; families with higher education teach the children lessons on loving the motherland; singing and dancing are taught by elementary school students from the factory's children's school. There are four to six hours of lessons every week. In winter, the classrooms are set up in family homes, and in summer, they are under the eaves and in the shade of trees. In addition, there are daycare centers, where families participating in sideline production and female employees with many children can entrust their children here. The nurseries and kindergartens run by the families alone number one hundred and fifteen. They are all set up in the families' homes, and the child care workers are also taken up by the families. They do not get paid, and are completely voluntary labor. The equipment in the nurseries and kindergartens is gathered by the families themselves. The toys are made from waste materials.

One for All, All for One

There are many other things about family mutual assistance. Housework such as moving, sewing, buying rice, and buying groceries is also done collectively as much as possible. One person goes to the cooperative and buys things for several families. Families with sewing machines help others sew clothes, and others help her make shoes and mend socks. During the season for changing winter and summer clothes, everyone gathers together to make clothes collectively. Some cut, some sew, some drill holes, and with everyone lending a hand, the clothes are made in a few days. When a family moves, everyone helps her move things and tidy up the house. The families have also established one hundred and fourteen savings mutual aid groups, with savings of more than two thousand yuan. If a family encounters temporary difficulties, they can borrow it. The family committee also organized more than four hundred families to establish laundry groups and sewing groups to wash clothes and sew work clothes for the factory and employees, earning some money to subsidize the family. In 1956, the trade union's relief funds were more than 60,000 yuan, which decreased to more than 30,000 yuan last year. This year, they plan to engage in some more sideline industries to overcome the difficulties of the family's life.

The family mutual assistance work here is completely a voluntary and unpaid collective undertaking. With this spirit of mutual assistance, thousands of small families are united into one family, and a new atmosphere of one for all and all for one has emerged. Due to mutual assistance and mutual aid, the families not only helped thousands of families solve various difficulties, and ensured that all factory employees could work and live in peace; but also helped families get rid of the burden of housework, actively participate in social activities, and study culture with peace of mind. Last year alone, the mutual aid group helped 2,730 family members who were giving birth or sick a total of 4,925 days, so that employees did not ask for leave due to household chores. There are often more than 1,600 family members participating in cultural learning, and their test scores are even better than those of the employees.

The families see that the work of the mutual aid group is beneficial to the country, the factory, and themselves, so they are getting more and more energetic in doing it. Each mutual aid group has formulated some systems to regularize the mutual assistance work; and constantly improve the mutual assistance work based on the principles of more, faster, better, and more economical. For example, taking care of pregnant women is generally stipulated to be seven days, and those who are sick can extend the time. In the past, the mutual aid group automatically rotated three people every day, one was called an "external affairs person" responsible for inviting doctors and buying things; one was called an "internal affairs person" responsible for cooking, washing clothes, and tidying up the room; and the other was called a "childcare person" responsible for taking care of the pregnant woman, internal affairs person, external affairs person's family and their own children. Now it has been reduced to two people, canceling the childcare person. The work of internal and external affairs is done in shifts, and when they are not working, they are responsible for taking care of the children.

Willing to Do Things for Everyone

This mutual assistance work was not done so well at the beginning. Some family members did not understand the benefits of mutual assistance. They said, "I don't need help from others, why should I help others." Many family members were unwilling to be family group leaders. They said, "Eat people's food, run errands like a dog; wear out shoes, and still get complained about." Gao Fengqin, a nationally renowned family model, united a group of activists and took the lead in helping others. They didn't mind being dirty, not afraid of being tired, not afraid of being scolded, and took the initiative to help whoever had something to do. Those who were helped were very moved and changed their views, and some became activists. Bi Jixiang's wife did not participate in the mutual aid group at first. She believed that her family had a lot of income and could hire someone to do things. Later, her mother-in-law suddenly fell and was injured. The couple went to the hospital, leaving three children at home with no one to take care of them. When the mutual aid group found out, they took the initiative to help her take care of the children. When his mother-in-law died, everyone helped make funeral clothes. Since then, she realized the benefits of mutual assistance, actively participated in activities, and became an activist. Now the ranks of family activists have expanded to more than 1,300 people. People who become group leaders are very happy and feel honored. They said, "Everyone is willing to do something for everyone!"

The Party Committee of this factory attaches great importance to family work and truly implements the policy of mobilizing employees and families together. The whole factory requires family members to participate in any movement, and all family members participate in discussions on any major issues. Therefore, the families are very concerned about the factory and closely link their love for the factory with their love for the family. They all understand that doing a good job in housework is a contribution to the cause of socialist construction.

    新社会  大家庭
    本报记者　陈迹　温述仙
    家家亮堂堂
    在一大片树丛中，整齐地排列着一幢幢简朴的楼房。这里居住着几千户沈阳东北机器制造厂的职工家属。初春的一个假日，我们到这里来访问。家属委员会主任高凤琴在她家里接待我们。我们一走进她家的门，就有一种清新的感觉。屋里的一切东西都非常整洁，家具洗得发亮，特别是没有油漆过的地板很引人注意。不论卧室、厨房和厕所的地板，都擦得又白又亮，像刚用刀刮过的菜板；我们特意用手摸了摸，没沾上一点灰尘。高凤琴告诉我们：自从1952年以来，这里每家的清洁卫生都搞得很好，养成讲卫生的习惯，进屋都要脱鞋。她还说别家的地板比她家的还要刷得干净。后来，我们访问了好几家，家家地板亮堂堂，处处都很清洁。
  组织起来　全面互助
    我们感到很惊奇，为什么几千户人家，家家都能长期做到这样干净？我们一深入了解，发现一个重要原因，是家属们实行了互助。旧社会有句自私的话，叫做“各人自扫门前雪，休管他人瓦上霜”；现在这里的家属却不分你我，不但共同搞好公共场所的环境卫生，还互相帮助各家搞好卫生。凡是怀孕、生孩子和年老体弱的家属，左邻右舍都经常去帮助她们收拾屋子、刷地板。阎秀英身体不好，没力气搞卫生工作。但是三、四年来，每星期总有四个家属去帮助她擦玻璃窗子、刷地板、洗大件衣物，所以她家的卫生情况一直都很好。
    在这里，生儿育女、婚丧嫁娶和做饭买菜等，都实行了互助。这个工厂职工的家庭大部分是夫妻两人带几个孩子过日子，一遇到家属生病、生孩子，职工就要请假耽误生产；如果家属参加文化学习和社会活动，孩子就无人照管。因此工厂家属委员会把全厂家属都组织起来，以三、四十户为单位，建立了成百个互助组，依靠大家集体的力量，互相帮助，解决各种困难。如果你病了，互助组的家属轮流送你到医院，代你拿药，帮你做饭、带孩子。万一孩子闹病，大家也来帮助你。家属王海香的大孩子患猩红热，她陪孩子住了十三天医院。家里留下一个七、八个月吃奶的孩子，交给互助组。互助组家属轮流替她奶孩子，带孩子睡觉。她的丈夫照常去工厂上班，没有请一天假。他说：“互助组真解决问题，孩子照管得好好的，我连一小时都没有管过。”万一有个家属不幸去世，大家便忙着帮她缝寿衣、办丧事。要是她留下子女没人照管，互助组家属们就像母亲一样，每天帮助孩子做饭、收拾屋子，冷了还给缝棉衣，做鞋子，直到孩子的父亲找到人照顾为止。技师佟文魁的妻子死了，留下两个孩子，由互助组家属照管了一个冬天，佟文魁没有因为家务牵累而影响一天工作。
    自从有了互助组，职工结婚前后的一切事情，都由家属们帮助料理。有一次，青年工人霍兆山要结婚，准备自己收拾屋子。家属们知道了，马上替他布置好新房，还替他缝被褥，接新娘，招待客人。他感激地说：“我们工厂的家属真像我的亲人。我要不使劲生产，怎么能对得起她们呢？”新媳妇过了门，有些家务事不一定都会做，互助组家属还热心帮助新媳妇学会家务事。
    不用国家一文钱举办115个托儿站
    哪一家总要有几个孩子，有了孩子，家务事就多起来。不少工厂家属因为要照管子女，不能参加文化学习和社会活动。但是，这里的家属孩子再多，也能参加各种活动。工厂家属委员会采用互助的办法，不花国家一文钱，举办了四种托儿组织，收托了二千六百多个孩子，占全厂学龄前儿童总数的90％以上，帮助家属们解除了孩子的拖累。这四种托儿组织是根据不同的需要建立起来的。有集体的临时托儿站，收托参加集体活动的家属的孩子；有两班倒的临时托儿站，凡是参加文化学习的家属，根据上课时间的不同，互相代管孩子；有幼儿班，把近千个学龄前儿童组织起来，分成二十三个班，进行教育。每班有二、三个教员，由家属中选出人来担任，轮流给儿童上课。文化不高但懂得工农业劳动生产的家属，给儿童们讲爱劳动的课程，喜欢绘花的家属，教儿童们做手工；文化较高的家属，给儿童们讲爱祖国的课；唱歌跳舞请工厂子弟学校的小学生来教。每星期上四至六小时的课。冬天课堂设在家属屋内，夏天在屋檐、树荫下。此外，还有日间托儿站，凡是参加副业生产的家属和多子女的女职工，可以把孩子寄托在这里。光是家属办的托儿站和幼儿班就有一百一十五个，它们都是设在家属的家里，保育员也是由家属担任的，不要报酬，完全是义务劳动。托儿站、幼儿班的设备是家属们自己凑的。玩具是利用废物做的。
    我为人人　人人为我
    家属互助的事情还很多。像搬家、做针线活、买米、买菜等家务事，也尽量集体去办。一个人上合作社，就代买几家人的东西。有缝纫机的人家，帮助别人缝衣服，别人帮她做鞋子、补袜子。在换冬夏衣的季节，大家聚在一起，集体做衣服，裁的裁，打的打，钻眼的钻眼，七手八脚，几天工夫就把衣服做好了。家属搬家时候，大家帮她搬东西，收拾屋子。家属们还建立了一百一十四个储金互助组，储金二千多元，家属如遇到临时性的困难，可以借用。家属委员会还组织四百多名家属，成立洗衣组和缝纫组，为工厂和职工洗衣服，缝工作服，赚些钱补贴家用。1956年工会救济款六万多元，去年减少到三万多元。今年还打算再搞些副业，克服家属生活困难。
    这里的家属互助工作，完全是自觉自愿的、没有报酬的集体主义事业。有了这种互助精神，就把几千户小家庭团结成一家人，出现了我为人人人人为我的新风气。家属们由于互助互济，不但帮助千百个家庭解决了各种困难，保证全厂职工能够安心生产和工作；而且帮助家属解除家务的牵累，积极参加社会活动，安心学习文化。去年一年，互助组光是帮助生育、生病的家属就有两千七百三十人次，共达四千九百二十五天，使职工不因为家务事而请假。职工们说：“把我调到天边，我也不用记挂家里。”参加文化学习的家属经常有一千六百多人，她们考试的成绩比职工还好。
    家属们看到互助组工作对国家、工厂和自己都有好处，所以干起来劲头越来越足。各个互助组都订出一些制度，使互助工作经常化；还本着多、快、好、省的原则，不断改进互助工作。例如照顾产妇，一般都规定七天，有病的可以延长时间。过去互助组每天自动轮流去三个人，一个叫外勤，负责请医生，买东西；一个叫内勤，负责做饭、洗衣服、收拾房间；另外一个叫托儿勤，负责照管产妇、内勤、外勤家属和自己的孩子。现在减为两个人，取消托儿勤。内、外勤的工作错开来做，不工作时，就负责看孩子。
   给大伙办事  人人都乐意
    这种互助工作，在一开始的时候，并不是做得这样好的。有些家属不了解互助的好处，她们说：“我不需要别人帮助，何必去帮助别人。”许多家属不愿做家属小组长，她们说：“吃人饭，蹓狗腿；跑破鞋子，还挨人埋怨。”全国著名的家属模范高凤琴团结了一批积极分子，带头帮助别人。她们不嫌脏，不怕累，不怕挨骂，那家有事就主动去帮助。得到帮助的人很受感动，转变了看法，有的成为积极分子。毕纪相的妻子最初不参加互助组，她认为自己家里收入多，有事可以雇人做。后来她婆婆突然摔跤受伤，夫妇两人跟到医院去了，家里丢下三个孩子没人照管。互助组知道了，主动去帮助她照看孩子。他婆婆死了，大家又帮着做寿衣。从此，她体会到互助的好处，便积极参加活动，成了一个积极分子。现在家属积极分子队伍已扩大到一千三百多人。当上小组长的人都很高兴，感到光荣。她们说：“能给大伙办点事，谁都乐意！”
    这个工厂的党委会非常重视家属工作，真正贯彻了职工和家属一齐发动的方针。全厂不论搞什么运动，都要家属参加，决定什么重大问题，所有家属都参加讨论。因此，家属们都很关心工厂，把爱厂和爱家密切地联系起来。她们都懂得，搞好家务，就是对社会主义建设事业贡献了力量。
