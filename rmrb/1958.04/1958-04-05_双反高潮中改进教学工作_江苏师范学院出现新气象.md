Improving Teaching Work During the Anti-Rightist Upsurge
New Atmosphere Appears at Jiangsu Normal College
(Our Dispatch) Jiangsu Normal College has improved its teaching work through the Anti-Rightist movement. From March 5th to 9th, the school put up 650,000 big-character posters, quickly forming a high tide. During the movement, they rectified and reformed simultaneously. Many leading cadres and teachers went deep into the departments, changed teaching methods, conducted mutual self-criticism, and strengthened unity.

In order to deeply improve the work, Party and administrative leaders, general branch secretaries, and department heads of the college all opened up "experimental plots." For example, Liu Lieren, the Party Secretary of the college, took the Political Science Department as his experimental plot and often went to this department to discuss the work with the teachers; during extracurricular activities, you could see many young men surrounding an old man with gray hair, talking intimately. In order to correct the shortcomings of managing teaching but not managing learning, many department heads also served as class advisors for a class, taking full responsibility for guiding students' academic studies and ideological development. Many veteran teachers also personally went to student dormitories to tutor and correct some assignments; some specifically opened tutoring classes for worker-peasant students. Some departments added new elective courses for students, and more teachers were determined to write good lecture notes for their courses to reduce the difficulties in students' learning.

In scientific research work, a new leap forward situation has also emerged. Each department stipulates that scientific report meetings be held once or twice each year. The History Department proposed that each teacher should have at least one scientific research report each year.

Older teachers with research capabilities have been spurred on with revolutionary zeal and are all putting forward personal targets in their plans. For example, Professor Zhu Zhengyuan, Director of the Physics Department, proposed to complete the writing of the textbook "General Physics (Mechanics Part)" within two years. (Xiao Jun)

    双反高潮中改进教学工作
    江苏师范学院出现新气象
    本报讯　江苏师范学院经过双反运动，改进了教学工作。该校自3月5日至9日共贴出大字报六十五万张，迅速形成了高潮。在运动中边整边改，不少领导干部和教师深入系科，改变教学方法，互相检讨，加强团结。
    为了深入改进工作，该院党与行政领导干部和总支书记系科主任等都开辟了“试验田”。如院党委书记刘烈人，以政专科作为他的试验田后，便经常到这个科同教师们共同商讨科的工作；在课外活动时也会看到很多年轻的小伙子围着一个头发已花白的老伯伯在亲密地交谈。为了改正管教不管学的缺点，很多系科主任兼任了一个班级的班导师，对同学的业务学习和思想锻炼负责全面指导。很多老教师也亲自到学生宿舍去辅导和改部分作业；有的专门为工农学生开设了辅导班。有的系科为同学增设了新的选课，更多的教师决心写好本门课的讲义，以减少同学学习上的困难。
    在科学研究工作上，也出现了新的跃进形势。各系科都规定每年度举行科学报告会一至两次。历史系提出每个教师每年至少有一篇科学研究报告。
    有研究能力的老教师，更鼓起了革命干劲，都在规划中提出个人的指标。如物理系主任朱正元教授提出在两年内完成普通物理（力学部分）教材的编写工作。（筱俊）
