    Let a Hundred Flowers Bloom
    Guo Moruo
    13　Spring Orchid
    We also dislike people praising us with terms like "fragrance of the king," and we dislike people calling us "gentlemen among flowers." In fact, we grow in the mountains by the springs, and woodcutters and forest farmers are our good neighbors. The gurgling clear spring seeps out from the rocky crevices of the secluded valley, the air is very cool, and the moss is very luxuriant. We deeply wish to return to our hometown, listen to the tinkling of the flowing spring, and sing the praises of the greening east wind in a peaceful neighborhood.
    14　February Orchid
    You certainly won't find us in the compendium of flowers; we grow wild in damp and remote places. Simple people are willing to associate with us, because plucking our tender moss can be used as a side dish. You don't need to spend any labor to plant us, nor do you need to spend any money to buy us; as long as you are willing to put down a little of your status, once you pick us, we guarantee you will have us again every year.
    15　Garden Balsam
    The old-fashioned literati were really too bureaucratic, even assigning ranks and titles to flowers. (Note) Some people even degraded us as the twin maids of the chrysanthemum, which made our chrysanthemum sister unhappy. Country girls call us "fingernail flower" because they love to use us to dye their fingernails red. Seriously speaking, this is a very poetic custom, more economical and elegant than using nail polish.
    (Note) The "Flower Classic" designates garden balsam as "seventh rank, third life," and other flowers are generally assigned such official ranks.
    16　Holly
    Our flowers are really pitifully small, and before you know it, they have already formed into small clusters of fruit. The emerald small beads gradually turn into coral, and even in freezing weather, the color is like cinnabar. We hate sparrows the most, and our whole body is insured. The green leaves are like jade carvings, with several needle tips on them. In the eyes of the sparrows, we are like tigers; unfortunately, we can only defend ourselves and cannot eliminate this pest.
    17　Nandina
    We and holly are close comrades; we are both red companions in winter. The nandina flower also does not attract people's attention, but without flowers, where would our seeds come from? Sparrows also dare not peck at coral beads, probably because they know we have toxins. Our toxins are medicinal drugs; how many diseases can they cure? Please ask the doctor.

    百花齐放
    郭沫若
    13　春兰
    我们也讨厌人们夸说什么“王者香”，也讨厌人们说我们是“花中君子”，其实我们是生长在山里的泉水边，樵夫和林农本来是我们的好邻里。脉脉的清泉浸出幽谷的岩隙中，空气是十分清冷，苔藓是十分蒙茸。我们深愿回到故乡，倾听流泉的琤琮，在幽静的邻里中歌颂着绿化的东风。
    14　二月兰
    在群芳谱中自然找不出我们，我们野生在阴湿的偏僻地面。素朴的人们倒肯和我们打交道，因为摘去我们的嫩苔可以佐餐。既不要你们花费任何劳力来栽，也不要你们花费什么金钱去买；只要你们肯放下一点儿身分呵，采过一次，包管你们年年都会再。
    15　凤仙花
    旧式的文人们官气实在太盛，对于花卉也要委派几品几命。（注）有人还把我们贬斥为菊花的双婢，我们的菊花姐姐听了都不高兴。乡下姑娘们叫我们做“指甲花”，因为她们爱用我们来染红指甲。认真说这倒是很有诗意的习惯，比起使用蔻丹来经济而又风雅。
    （注）“花经”定凤仙花为“七品三命”，其他各种花大抵都定了这样的官阶。
    16　虎刺
    我们的花朵实在是小得可怜，在不经意间竟早已小实成团。翡翠的小珠逐渐变成为珊瑚，尽管是冰天雪地，颜色如丹朱。我们最恨麻雀，全身都在保险，碧叶如玉琢成，上有几个针尖。在麻雀们看来，我们真像老虎；可惜只能防卫，此害未能扫除。
    17　南天竹
    我们和虎刺是亲密的同志，咱们都是冬天的红色伴侣。南天花也引不起人们注意，但没有花，哪来我们的种籽？麻雀也不敢来啄食珊瑚珠，大概他们知道我们有毒素。我们的毒素是治病的药品；能治多少病？请去问问大夫。
