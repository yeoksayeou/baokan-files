    To Force the US and Britain to Stop Nuclear Tests

    Upon reading the news about the Soviet Union's unilateral cessation of nuclear weapons testing, I felt extremely excited and joyful. This great and just initiative not only demonstrated once again the Soviet Union's sincere desire for peace, but also showed the socialist camp, led by the Soviet Union, was full of confidence in the power of peace. This peaceful action by the Soviet Union will further promote the struggle to demand the cessation of nuclear testing and the prohibition of nuclear weapons, and facilitate the easing of international tensions. This is the Soviet Union's new contribution to world peace and human happiness.

    Having suffered the disasters of war, I deeply understand the value of peace and resolutely oppose the imperialists' criminal activities of arms expansion and war preparation. My father was a hardworking seafarer who, during the War of Resistance Against Japan, was killed by imperialist aircraft in the sea near Wusongkou, Shanghai. Before liberation, my entire family suffered all kinds of pain and torment, living a life worse than beasts of burden. Only after liberation did we enjoy a peaceful and happy life. However, the past suffering can never be forgotten. To defend our happy days today and strive for a better future, we must actively fight for peace.

    Regardless of the wishes of the people of the world, the US government not only blatantly rejected the Soviet proposal, but also decided to resume nuclear weapons testing in the high seas of the Pacific from April 5th. The British government also stated its refusal to stop nuclear testing. This stubborn attitude of the ruling groups of the United States and Britain once again exposed their position of paying lip service to peace while actually stepping up preparations for war. At the same time, this reminds the people of the world that peace cannot be begged for or waited for, but must be actively fought for. I hope that our people nationwide will launch a campaign to "support the Soviet statement and demand that the United States and Britain immediately stop nuclear testing," and call on the people of the world to unite and launch a broader and more resolute struggle to force the US and British governments to accept the proposal to stop nuclear testing.

    With infinite gratitude, I warmly welcome and support the Soviet Union's statement on ceasing nuclear weapons testing.

    I am a blind person. Under the care and attention of the Party and the government, I have also obtained the opportunity to work and live a peaceful and happy life. We need peace as much as we need light. Although our eyes cannot see, our hearts are clear, and we deeply understand the harm of the nuclear arms race to humanity. Now, US imperialism has decided to continue nuclear weapons testing, and I feel extremely angry. I resolutely protest against the US government's actions to undermine peace, and I demand that the governments of the United States and Britain learn from the example of the Soviet Union, immediately stop nuclear weapons testing, and reach an agreement on the prohibition of atomic weapons and hydrogen weapons as soon as possible.

    要迫使美英停止核试验
    看到报纸上发表的关于苏联单方面停止试验核武器的消息，我感到十分兴奋和喜悦。这一伟大的正义创举，不仅又一次表明了苏联热爱和平的真挚愿望，而且显示了以苏联为首的社会主义阵营对于和平的力量满怀信心。苏联这个和平行动，必将进一步推动要求停止核试验和禁止核武器的斗争，并促进国际紧张局势的缓和。这是苏联对于世界和平和人类的幸福的新贡献。
    由于曾经遭受战争的灾难，我深深地懂得和平的可贵，坚决地反对帝国主义者扩军备战的罪恶活动。我的父亲是个勤劳的海员工人，在抗日战争期间，被帝国主义的飞机炸死在上海吴淞口附近的海面。在解放以前，我们全家受尽了种种痛苦和折磨，过着牛马不如的生活。解放以后，我们才享受到和平幸福的生活。但是，过去的苦难是永远忘不了的。为了保卫今天的幸福日子，争取更加美好的将来，我们必须积极地为和平而斗争。
    美国政府不顾世界人民的愿望，不仅悍然拒绝苏联的建议，而且决定从4月5日开始又在太平洋的公海上试验核武器。英国政府也表示拒绝停止核试验。美英两国统治集团这种顽固态度，再一次暴露了它们空谈和平、实际上却加紧准备战争的立场。同时这也提醒了全世界人民，和平决不能哀求和等待，而要积极去争取。我希望我们全国人民展开一个“支持苏联声明，要求美英立即停止核试验”的运动，并呼吁全世界人民一致行动起来，展开更加广泛和坚决的斗争，迫使美英政府接受停止核试验的建议。

    我怀着无限感激的心情，热烈地欢迎和拥护苏联停止核武器试验的声明。
    我是一个盲人。在党和政府的关怀和照顾下，我也获得了劳动的机会，过着和平幸福的生活。我们需要和平，就像需要光明一样。我们虽然眼睛看不见，但是我们的心是雪亮的，我们深深懂得核武器竞赛对于人类的危害性。现在，美帝国主义竟决定继续要试验核武器，我感到万分的愤怒。我坚决抗议美国政府这种破坏和平的行动，并要求美英两国政府学习苏联的榜样，立即停止核武器试验，早日就禁止原子武器和氢武器的问题达成协议。
