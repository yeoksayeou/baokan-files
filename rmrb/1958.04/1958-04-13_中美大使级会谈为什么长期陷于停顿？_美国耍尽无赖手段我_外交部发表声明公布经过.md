Xinhua News Agency, April 12th – The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China issued a statement, announcing the process of the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks being stalled for a long period.
	Since the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks held its 73rd meeting on December 12, 1957, four months have passed. During this period, despite repeated urging from the Chinese side, the United States has used the same delaying tactics it employed in Panmunjom, leading to a prolonged stagnation of the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks. This situation has aroused dissatisfaction among the Chinese people and concern among peace-loving people around the world. In order to clarify the truth, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has decided to publish the process of the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks being stalled for a long period.

	(1) At the 73rd meeting of the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks, the U.S. representative, Ambassador U. Alexis Johnson, informed the Chinese representative, Ambassador Wang Bingnan, that he had been transferred and would no longer participate in the talks. The U.S. government had appointed his assistant, Mr. Edwin W. Martin, as the U.S. representative.

	At that time, Ambassador Wang Bingnan pointed out that the holding of ambassadorial-level talks between China and the United States was the result of consultations between the two sides, and one side could not arbitrarily change it; the U.S. government's appointment of Mr. Martin, who did not have ambassadorial status, as a representative, was obviously inconsistent with the provisions of the agreement between the two sides.

	Thus, the two sides did not determine and announce the date of the next meeting.

	(2) On January 14, 1958, Ambassador Wang Bingnan wrote to Ambassador Johnson, pointing out that the U.S. side had long obstructed the progress of the talks in various ways, and now it was attempting to lower the level of the talks. The U.S. side's purpose was to superficially maintain the Sino-U.S. talks, creating a false impression, while actually not preparing to solve the problem. Ambassador Wang was authorized to declare that the Chinese government could not agree to the U.S. government's unilateral change of the results of Sino-U.S. consultations, and if the U.S. government still intended to continue the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks, it should appoint an ambassadorial-level representative as soon as possible.

	After a delay of nearly two months, Mr. Martin, on behalf of Ambassador Johnson, replied to Ambassador Wang Bingnan on March 12, 1958. Mr. Martin's reply repeated Ambassador Johnson's speech at the 73rd meeting and indicated that the U.S. government continued to adopt a delaying attitude toward the appointment of an ambassadorial-level representative. Moreover, Mr. Martin also attempted to shift the responsibility for the past failure of the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks to meet people's expectations onto the Chinese side.

	(3) Mr. Martin's reply on behalf of the U.S. government was disappointing. Lai Yali, assistant to Ambassador Wang Bingnan, was therefore ordered to inform Mr. Martin of the U.S. side on March 26, 1958: The Chinese government could neither agree to unilaterally changing the level of the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks, nor could it agree to the long-term interruption and nominal existence of the talks for administrative reasons; if the U.S. government still intended to continue the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks, it should no longer delay the appointment of an ambassadorial-level representative.

	(4) From the above correspondence, it can be clearly seen that the Chinese side has kept its word and its attitude is fair, while the United States has done everything possible to delay, trying to break its promise and undermine the agreement. Under the pressure of the world's people strongly demanding the easing of international tensions, the United States does not dare to openly break the Sino-U.S. talks, but on the other hand, it fears that the easing of the situation will make its Cold War policy even more unsustainable. Therefore, it not only obstructs any progress in the talks, but also attempts to make the talks completely lose their effect. This is the root cause of the United States' use of all kinds of shameless tactics over the past four months to bring the Sino-U.S. talks to a prolonged standstill.

	(5) The full texts of Ambassador Wang Bingnan's letter to Ambassador Johnson on January 14, 1958, Martin's letter to Ambassador Wang Bingnan on March 12, 1958, and Lai Yali's letter to Martin on March 26, 1958, are hereby published as follows:

	I. Ambassador Wang Bingnan's letter to Ambassador Johnson

	To Mr. U. Alexis Johnson, Ambassador of the United States of America to the Czechoslovak Republic, via the U.S. Consulate General in Geneva:

	At the 73rd meeting of the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks held on December 12, 1957, you informed me that you had been transferred and would no longer participate in the talks, but the U.S. government still decided to continue the talks in Geneva and had appointed your assistant, Mr. E. W. Martin, as the U.S. representative.

	I pointed out to you at that time that the holding of ambassadorial-level talks between China and the United States was the result of consultations between the two sides, and one side could not arbitrarily change it. Your side's appointment of Mr. Martin, who does not have ambassadorial status, as a representative, is obviously inconsistent with the above-mentioned agreement between the two sides.

	I think you must still remember that in 1955, the Chinese and U.S. sides decided to hold ambassadorial-level talks based on a common understanding, that is, if the talks between the Chinese and U.S. consuls at that time were conducted at a higher level of authority, it would help solve the problem of civilians returning to their countries and would also be conducive to further discussing and resolving certain other practical issues in dispute between us.

	For more than two years, our talks have been unsatisfactory. Although we have reached an agreement on the issue of civilians returning to their countries, and although the Chinese side has consistently and faithfully implemented this agreement, it is difficult to say that the U.S. side has taken the same attitude towards this agreement. In the talks, the Chinese side has repeatedly put forward constructive suggestions to seek the improvement of relations between our two countries, but these suggestions have been rejected by the U.S. side. As a result, our talks have been in a state of stagnation for a long time. Now, the U.S. side is attempting to downgrade the ambassadorial-level talks, which have not been fully effective. This cannot but make people doubt the true intentions of the U.S. side.

	The Chinese government agreed to hold Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks in order to solve problems. Superficially maintaining Sino-U.S. talks, but actually not intending to solve problems, but attempting to create a false impression that relations between China and the United States are improving, is definitely not the intention of the Chinese government, nor is it the intention that any government responsible to its people should have. The Chinese government has always emphasized that if problems are to be solved, both sides must have sincerity and strictly abide by the principle of reciprocity. I am authorized to inform you that the Chinese government cannot agree to the U.S. government's unilateral change of the results of Sino-U.S. consultations, and if the U.S. government still intends to continue the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks, the U.S. government should appoint an ambassadorial-level representative as soon as possible.

	I await your reply.

	Wang Bingnan, Representative of the People's Republic of China to the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks
	January 14, 1958

	II. Martin's Letter to Ambassador Wang Bingnan

	Geneva

	His Excellency Ambassador Wang Bingnan

	Dear Mr. Ambassador:

	I have received your letter of January 14, 1958, to Ambassador Johnson. As Ambassador Johnson explained to you at our meeting on December 12, 1957, he has been reassigned, and I have been appointed as the United States representative.

	You correctly mention that the decision in 1955 to raise the talks previously held by U.S. and People's Republic of China consular officials to the ambassadorial level reflected a desire that the issue of civilians returning to their countries would thereby be more easily resolved, and that this would be conducive to further discussing and resolving other practical issues in dispute between us. I also fully agree with your statement that the talks have been unsatisfactory for more than two years. However, I must emphatically reject your assertion that the failure of the talks to meet people's expectations is due to the attitude of the United States. In fact, it is due to the attitude of your side and the unwillingness to fulfill its promises that the talks have not yielded results.

	On September 10, 1955, you and Ambassador Johnson agreed upon and published a joint statement on the issue of civilians returning to their countries, in which the People's Republic of China undertook the obligation to take appropriate measures to enable Americans in its territory who wish to return to their country to exercise their right to return to the United States as soon as possible. The issue of the return of forty-one Americans has been a topic of discussion. When the joint statement was published, nineteen of these forty-one people were still awaiting release from prison or house arrest. Today, almost two and a half years later, your side still clearly violates its explicit obligations under that statement and detains six American citizens despite their wishes. In contrast, the United States has always allowed all Chinese in the United States who wish to return to the People's Republic of China to return. According to the joint statement, any Chinese in the United States who believes that he is being obstructed from returning to the People's Republic of China may notify the Embassy of the Republic of India in the United States and request it to negotiate with the U.S. government on his behalf. The Embassy of the Republic of India has not raised a single objection, which irrefutably proves that no Chinese in the United States has been or is being obstructed from returning to the People's Republic of China.

	As Ambassador Johnson said on December 12, 1957, the United States is currently unable to appoint an ambassadorial-level representative. However, this matter is being carefully considered, and I believe that a U.S. representative of this rank will be appointed as soon as it is possible to do so. In the meantime, as the appointed U.S. representative, I am ready to meet with you or another representative appointed by your government in Geneva at a time convenient to both sides.

	Sincerely,

	Edwin W. Martin (signature)

	U.S. Representative

	March 12, 1958

	III. Lai Yali's Letter to Martin

	To Mr. Edwin W. Martin, Representative of the U.S. Delegation to the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks, via the U.S. Consulate General in Geneva

	Mr. Martin:

	I have received your reply of March 12, 1958, on behalf of Ambassador Johnson, to Ambassador Wang Bingnan's letter of January 14 of the same year. In response, I am instructed to reply as follows:

	More than three months have passed since the last meeting, and the talks have been interrupted due to the U.S. government's failure to appoint an ambassadorial-level representative. Now, in your letter, you are still repeating Ambassador Johnson's remarks at the last meeting, without making any further indication on the U.S. government's appointment of an ambassadorial-level representative, which cannot but be disappointing. The Chinese government believes that it is intolerable for the talks to remain in a nominal state for a long time. If the U.S. government still intends to continue the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks, the U.S. government should no longer delay the appointment of an ambassadorial-level representative.

	In your letter, you attempt to shift the responsibility for the failure of the past Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks to meet the expectations placed upon them onto our side, which is futile. Facts speak louder than words. Our side has not only faithfully implemented the joint statement on the issue of civilians returning to their countries, allowing all ordinary Americans who wished to return to their country to leave China, but also continuously put forward in the talks a series of reasonable proposals to ease the tension in the Taiwan area, remove trade barriers between China and the United States, promote cultural exchanges and people-to-people exchanges between China and the United States, exchange journalists, and negotiate a judicial assistance agreement, all of which are sufficient to improve Sino-U.S. relations. However, all of these proposals have been unreasonably rejected by your side. Moreover, your side has openly violated the agreement on the issue of civilians returning to their countries, taking various measures to obstruct thousands of Chinese in the United States from returning to their own country. They have suffered all kinds of persecution and threats and have been fundamentally deprived of the freedom to contact the Indian Embassy in the United States or request investigation and negotiation. This situation is sufficient to demonstrate the seriousness of your side's violation of the agreement.

	In your letter, you also acknowledge that the holding of ambassadorial-level talks was a decision reached through consultations between China and the United States, which means that your side, like our side, has the obligation to abide by and implement this decision. The Chinese government can neither agree to unilaterally changing the level of the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks, nor can it agree to the long-term interruption and nominal existence of the talks for administrative reasons.

	After the U.S. government appoints an ambassadorial-level representative, I will be happy to contact you to discuss the specific time for the next meeting. I await your reply.

	Sincerely,

	Lai Yali, Assistant to Ambassador Wang Bingnan, Representative of the People's Republic of China to the Sino-U.S. Ambassadorial Talks

	March 26, 1958

    中美大使级会谈为什么长期陷于停顿？
    美国耍尽无赖手段我
    外交部发表声明公布经过
    新华社12日讯　中华人民共和国外交部发表声明，公布中美大使级会谈长期陷于停顿的经过			            1958年4月12日
    自从中美大使级会谈在1957年12月12日举行了第七十三次会议以来，四个月已经过去了。在这期间，尽管中国方面一再催促，但是美国却使用了它在板门店所惯用的伎俩进行拖延，以致中美大使级会谈长期陷于停顿状态。这种情况引起了我国人民的不满和世界爱好和平人民的关心。为了说明事实真相，外交部决定公布中美大使级会谈长期陷于停顿的经过。
    （一）在中美大使级会谈第七十三次会议上，美方代表乌·阿·约翰逊大使通知我方代表王炳南大使说，他已经调任，今后不能参加会谈，美国政府已经委任他的助手爱德温·乌·马丁先生为美方代表。
    当时，王炳南大使就指出，中美两国举行大使级的会谈是中美双方协商的结果，一方不能任意加以改变；美国政府委派不具有大使级身份的马丁先生为代表，显然是不符合中美双方协议的规定的。
    这样，双方就没有确定和公布下次会谈的日期。
    （二）1958年1月14日王炳南大使致函约翰逊大使，指出长期以来美方多方阻挠会谈取得进展，现在又企图降低会谈级别，美方的目的是表面上维持中美会谈，造成一种假象，实际上不准备解决问题。王大使受权声明：中国政府不能同意美国政府片面改变中美双方协商的结果，如果美国政府还有意继续进行中美大使级会谈，它就应该尽早指派大使级的代表。
    在拖延了将近两个月之后，美方的马丁先生才于1958年3月12日代表约翰逊大使复函王炳南大使。马丁先生的这封复信重复了约翰逊大使在第七十三次会议上的发言，并且表明美国政府对于委派大使级的代表，继续采取拖延的态度。不仅如此，马丁先生还企图把过去中美大使级会谈未能实现人们的期望的责任推到我方身上。
    （三）马丁先生代表美国政府所作的这种答复令人失望。王炳南大使助理赖亚力因此奉命于1958年3月26日函告美方马丁先生：中国政府既不能同意片面改变中美大使级会谈的级别，也不能同意用行政性的理由使会谈长期中断，名存实亡；如果美国政府还有意继续进行中美大使级会谈，它就不应该再拖延指派大使级的代表。
    （四）从上述来往函件中，可以明显地看出中国方面是信守协议的，态度是公正的，而美国却竭尽拖延的能事，力图背弃诺言，破坏协议。在全世界人民强烈要求和缓国际紧张局势的压力下，美国不敢公然破裂中美会谈，但是另一方面，它又害怕形势的和缓将使它的冷战政策更不能得逞，因此，它不仅阻挠会谈取得任何进展，而且还企图使会谈根本失去作用。这就是四个月来美国耍尽无赖手法，使中美会谈陷于长期停顿的根源所在。
    （五）现将1958年1月14日王炳南大使给约翰逊大使的信，1958年3月12日马丁给王炳南大使的信，1958年3月26日赖亚力给马丁的信全文公布如下：
    一、王炳南大使给约翰逊大使的信
    美国驻日内瓦总领事馆转交美国驻捷克斯洛伐克共和国大使乌·阿·约翰逊先生大使先生：
    在1957年12月12日举行的中美大使级会谈第七十三次会议上，你通知我，你已经调任，今后不能参加会谈，但是美国政府仍旧决定继续在日内瓦的会谈，并且已经委任你的助手爱·乌·马丁先生为美方代表。
    我当时向你指出，中美两国举行大使级的会谈是中美双方协商的结果，一方不能任意加以改变。你方委派不具有大使级身份的马丁先生为代表，显然是不符合中美双方上述协议的。
    我想你一定还记得，1955年中美双方是根据这样一个共同认识而决定举行两国大使级会谈的，那就是，如果把当时中美领事之间的会谈放在更有权力的一级上进行，将会有助于两国平民回国问题的解决，也将有利于进一步讨论和解决我们双方之间有所争执的某些其他的实际问题。
    两年多以来，我们的会谈是不能令人满意的。尽管我们对两国平民回国问题达成了协议，尽管中国方面一贯忠实地执行了这个协议，但是，很难说美国方面也采取了同样的态度来对待这个协议。在会谈中，中国方面多次提出了建设性的建议，谋求我们两国关系的改善，但是，这些建议都遭到了美国方面的拒绝。结果，我们的会谈长期处于停顿不前的状态。现在，美国方面又企图使这个没有充分发挥作用的大使级会谈降级进行。这就不能不使人怀疑美国方面的用意究竟何在。
    中国政府是为了解决问题而同意举行中美大使级会谈的。表面上维持中美会谈，实际上不是为了解决问题，而是企图造成一种假象，似乎中美两国的关系正在改善，这决不是中国政府的意图，也不是任何一个对自己的人民负责的政府所应该抱有的意图。中国政府一贯强调，如果要解决问题，必需双方具有诚意，并且要严格遵守双方对等的原则。我受权通知你，中国政府不能同意美国政府片面改变中美双方协商的结果，如果美国政府还有意继续进行中美大使级会谈，美国政府应该尽早指派大使级的代表。
    我等待着你的回答。
    中美两国大使级会谈中华人
      民共和国代表　王炳南
                1958年1月14日
    二、马丁给王炳南大使的信日内瓦王炳南大使阁下亲爱的大使先生：
    我已经收到1958年1月14日你给约翰逊大使的信。约翰逊大使在1957年12月12日同你会晤时曾说明，他已调任新职，我受指派为美国代表。
    你正确地提到，1955年间把以前美国和中华人民共和国领事官员举行的会谈提高到大使级的决定反映了一种愿望，希望两国平民回国问题将从而比较容易解决，并且这样将有利于进一步讨论和解决我们双方之间有所争执的其他实际问题。我也完全同意你的说法，两年多来会谈是不能令人满意的。然而我必须着重地拒绝你关于会谈没有能够实现人们对它的期望是由于美国的态度所致的说法。实际上，正是由于你方的态度和不肯履行自己的诺言，才使会谈没有结果。
    1955年9月10日你和约翰逊大使协议了并且公布了关于双方平民回国问题的协议声明，在协议声明中中华人民共和国承担义务要采取适当措施使在本国境内愿意回国的美国人能尽速行使返回美国的权利。四十一个美国人回国的问题曾经是讨论的题目，当协议声明发表的时候，这四十一个人中有十九个人尚待释放出狱或解除软禁。而今天在几乎两年半以后，你方仍还分明违背自己在该声明中明确承担的义务，而且不顾他们的志愿扣留着六个美国公民。与此相反，美国一向准许在美国的所有愿意返回中华人民共和国的中国人回去。根据协议声明，在美国的任何中国人如果认为自己受到阻挠不能返回中华人民共和国，可以把这个情况通知印度共和国驻美国大使馆请求为他向美国政府交涉。印度共和国大使馆不曾提出过一次交涉，这就无可辩驳地证明，在美国没有任何中国人曾受到或正受到阻挠而不能返回中华人民共和国。
    正如约翰逊大使在1957年12月12日所说的，美国在目前不能够指派一位大使级的代表。但是这件事正在仔细考虑之中，我相信在可能办到时将立刻指派一位具有这种等级的美国代表。在此期间，我作为已被指派的美国代表，随时准备在对双方方便的时候在日内瓦同你或者贵国政府指派的另一位代表会晤。
    顺此致意
    美国代表爱德温·乌·马丁
                          （签名）
                1958年3月12日
    三、赖亚力给马丁的信
    美国驻日内瓦总领事馆转交中美大使级会谈美国代表团爱德温·乌·马丁先生马丁先生：
    你在1958年3月12日代表约翰逊大使答复王炳南大使同年1月14日去信的复函已经收到。对此，我奉命答复如下：
    自从上次会议以来，已经过去了三个多月，由于美国政府未指派大使级代表，会谈一直陷于中断状态。现在你在来信中还是重复约翰逊大使在上次会议中所作的发言，而未对美国政府指派大使级代表一事作进一步表示，这不能不使人感到失望。中国政府认为，使会谈长此处于有名无实的境地是不能容忍的，如果美国政府还有意继续进行中美大使级会谈，美国政府就不应该再拖延指派大使级代表。
    你在来信中企图把过去中美大使级会谈未能实现它被寄予的期望的责任推到我方身上是徒然的。事实胜于雄辩，我方不仅忠实地执行了关于双方平民回国问题的协议声明，使所有愿意回国的一般美国人离开了中国，而且还在会谈中连续提出了关于和缓台湾地区紧张局势，取消中美间贸易障碍，促进中美文化交流和人民往来，互派记者，以及谈判司法协助协议等一系列足以改善中美关系的合理建议。但是，所有这些建议都遭到了你方的无理拒绝，不仅如此，你方还公然违反关于双方平民回国问题的协议，采取各种手段阻挠成千的在美国的中国人回到他们自己的祖国。他们受尽了种种迫害和威胁，根本被剥夺了同印度驻美大使馆取得联系或者要求调查交涉的自由。这种情况正足以说明你方破坏协议的严重程度。
    你在来信中也承认举行大使级会谈是中美双方经过协商达成的决定，这就意味着你方和我方一样负有遵守和执行这一决定的义务。中国政府既不能同意片面改变中美大使级会谈的级别，也不能同意用行政性理由使会谈长期中断，名存实亡。
    在美国政府指派了大使级代表以后，我将乐于和你联系，商定举行下一次会议的具体时间。我等着你的答复。
    顺此致意
