The Anhui Province Eliminate Four Pests Headquarters issued an urgent notice requiring all localities to use five types of fish that eat mosquito larvae to devour mosquito larvae and prevent the breeding of mosquitoes. Currently, some places are preparing to catch fish fry and cultivate fish species to be released into ditches, ponds, and rice fields. This year, the planned area for rice fields raising fish is 1.19 million mu.

The five types of fish are: Betta (commonly known as "grass shoe sole," "fire-burnt bang ?"), according to experiments, each fish can devour more than 160 mosquito larvae per day; Yellow catfish (commonly known as "grass tooth," "ang si"), each fish can eat more than 200 mosquito larvae per day; Topmouth gudgeon (commonly known as "Luo Han fish"), carp, and crucian carp also like to eat mosquito larvae. Raising these fish not only eliminates mosquitoes but also carp and crucian carp have economic value. Raising carp and crucian carp in rice fields can eat mosquito larvae and rice stem borers in the rice fields, as well as grass. Fish manure is also very fertile, which can not only increase rice production but also develop aquaculture and increase the income of agricultural cooperatives.

In addition, the Anhui Province Eliminate Four Pests Headquarters recently transported a batch of tropical mosquito fish (also known as mosquito-eating fish) from Shanghai, which are good at eating mosquito larvae, and are being cultivated and bred at the Anhui Province Aquaculture Experiment Station.

    安徽利用五种鱼吞食孑孓
    本报讯　安徽省除四害总指挥部发出紧急通知，要求各地利用五种能吃孑孓的鱼吞食孑孓，防止蚊虫的孳生。现在，有些地方正在准备捕捉鱼苗，培养鱼种，在沟、塘、稻田内放养。今年计划养鱼的稻田就有一百一十九万亩。
    这五种鱼是：斗鱼（俗名“草鞋底”、“火烧鳑?”），据试验，每尾每天能吞食孑孓一百六十多个；黄颡鱼（俗名“草牙”、“盎丝”），每尾每天能食孑孓二百个以上；麦穗鱼（俗名“罗汉鱼”）、鲤鱼、鲫鱼，也喜欢吃孑孓。饲养这些鱼，不但能消灭蚊虫，而且鲤鱼、鲫鱼还有经济价值。稻田中养鲤鱼、鲫鱼，能吃稻田中的孑孓，二化螟虫，还能吃草，鱼粪也很肥，既可使水稻增产，又能发展水产事业，增加农业社收入。
    此外，安徽省除四害总指挥部最近还从上海运来一批热带善于吃孑孓的柳条鱼（又名捕蚊鱼），正在安徽省水产养殖试验站培养繁殖。　（秦聿震）
