A tower built on sand is easy to collapse, and a French government built on current North African policy is also impossible to stabilize. The Gaillard government, which had been in power for less than half a year, has collapsed again. This cabinet, because of its implementation of colonial policies, has been resolutely opposed by the Communist Party from the very beginning. It was only because this cabinet included members of almost all bourgeois parties that it managed to maintain itself until now.

Due to France's repeated setbacks in its North African colonial policy, quarrels among the various bourgeois parties (conservatives, social republicans, radical socialists, socialists) have been going on for a long time. The joint participation of these parties in the Gaillard cabinet was only a temporary compromise. Since the French air force bombed the village of Sakiet Sidi Youssef in Tunisia, the anti-colonial struggle of the North African people has further intensified, and the United States has taken the opportunity to squeeze out France under the guise of "mediation." Under this new situation, the contradictions within the French ruling group have become more acute.

The French National Assembly interrupted its Easter recess to hold a special meeting to discuss the "mediation" proposals put forward by the United States and Britain. The purpose of this proposal is, on the one hand, to curb the development of the anti-colonial movement of the North African people, and on the other hand, to replace France's colonial position in North Africa. Due to the activities of the United States, the Tunisian government has agreed not to demand the complete withdrawal of French troops from Tunisian territory and the recovery of the port of Bizerte at present. In order to get France to accept this proposal, the United States has exerted enormous pressure on the French government. Eisenhower even wrote to Gaillard personally, warning that if "mediation" failed and the issue was brought back to the United Nations, the United States would not give France any support.

Gaillard made concessions in the face of American pressure. The "Mediterranean Pact" plan, designed by Dulles to "North Atlanticize" Algeria, has already been put forward by him as his own initiative. He also expressed his willingness to accept the "mediation" proposal of the United States and Britain this time. Of course, Gaillard has his own difficulties in doing so: it seems that France cannot independently support its colonial rule in North Africa, so he does not hesitate to give up some territory in exchange for American support.

Obviously, Gaillard's approach cannot get France out of its predicament in North Africa. Because the North African people oppose not only French colonial rule, but also American enslavement. Although the United States has forced the Tunisian government to make some compromises in the "mediation" activities, this only makes the North African people further recognize the hypocrisy of the United States. The Tunisian "Action" weekly has repeatedly published commentaries criticizing the double-dealing conspiracy of the United States. The Algerian National Liberation Front has also issued a statement rejecting any proposal that would undermine the principle of Algerian independence. Moreover, for France, the result of trying to rely on the United States to maintain its colonial rule can only be complete exclusion by the United States. Indochina is a very obvious precedent. The conservatives and social republicans (who represent the colonial groups with greater interests in North Africa) are undoubtedly more sensitive to this point. After the "Mediterranean Pact" plan was put forward, these parties were already very dissatisfied. This time, Gaillard accepted the "mediation" proposal of the United States and Britain, they felt even more uneasy, and decided to overthrow this cabinet.

So, what are the conservatives and social republicans going to do? For a long time, they have been brewing and planning to organize a "strong" government of military dictatorship to implement a more hard-line policy in North Africa than the current one. The recent crazy provocations by French fascists are closely related to this conspiracy.

Can adopting more brutal suppression policies improve France's situation in North Africa? Obviously, this is just a fantasy of the colonialists. France has carried out three and a half years of bloody suppression in Algeria, with war expenses of two billion francs per day and troop deployment of 800,000 people, causing domestic impoverishment and exhaustion, but it is becoming more and more embarrassed on the Algerian battlefield. If France further expands the war in North Africa, it will only cause greater resistance from the North African people and accelerate France's defeat.

As for establishing a military dictatorship in France, it is by no means easy to do. The French working class and progressive forces, with their glorious tradition of struggle, under the leadership of the French Communist Party, have already launched a strong counterattack against fascist provocations. However, it should be pointed out that the fascist threat in France is one of the consequences of the French government's colonial war. Therefore, blocking the path of fascism and ending the "dirty war" in Algeria are two inseparable tasks of struggle facing the French people. To win victory in this struggle, the only path is the one repeatedly pointed out by the French Communist Party: the left-wing forces must strengthen their unity and establish a democratic government that can meet the will of the people reflected in the 1956 election. Only in this way can France find a correct way out.

    盖伊阿政府倒台
    本报评论员
    建立在沙滩上的塔是容易倾塌的，建立在现行北非政策基础上的法国政府也是不可能稳固的。上台不到半年的盖伊阿政府又垮台了。这个内阁由于执行殖民政策，从一开始就遭到共产党的坚决反对，只是这个内阁由于包括着几乎所有资产阶级政党的成员，才勉强维持到现在。
    由于法国在北非的殖民政策的不断碰壁，各个资产阶级政党（保守派、社会共和党、激进社会党、社会党）之间的争吵是由来已久了。这些政党共同参加盖伊阿内阁，只是一种暂时的妥协。自从法国空军轰炸突尼斯萨基埃特村的事件发生以后，北非人民反殖民主义的斗争进一步高涨，而美国又乘机借“斡旋”之名对法国进行排挤。在这种新的形势下，法国统治集团内部的矛盾又尖锐起来了。
    法国国民议会这次中断复活节休假而举行特别会议，为的就是讨论美英两国提出的“斡旋”建议。这项建议的目的，一方面是要阻遏北非人民反殖民主义运动的发展，另一方面是要取代法国在北非的殖民地位。由于美国的活动，突尼斯政府已经同意目前不要求法国军队全部撤出突尼斯国境和收回比塞大港。为了使法国接受这个建议，美国又向法国政府施加了巨大的压力。艾森豪威尔甚至亲自写信警告盖伊阿，如果“斡旋”失败而问题重新提到联合国，美国将不会给法国以任何支持。
    盖伊阿在美国的压力面前作了让步。杜勒斯设计的把阿尔及利亚“北大西洋化”的“地中海公约”计划，他已经当作自己的倡议提出来了。对于这次美英两国的“斡旋”建议，他也表示愿意接受。当然，盖伊阿这样做是有他的苦衷的：目前法国要独力支撑在北非的殖民统治看来是不行了，因此不惜让出一些地盘来换得美国的支持。
    显然，盖伊阿的这种做法并不能使法国摆脱在北非的困境。因为，北非人民既反对法国的殖民统治，也同样不愿意受美国的奴役。虽然美国在“斡旋”活动中迫使突尼斯政府作了一些妥协，但是这只有使北非人民进一步认清了美国的伪善面目。突尼斯“行动”周刊就一再发表评论，抨击美国两面三刀的阴谋。阿尔及利亚民族解放阵线也曾经发表声明，拒绝任何有损于阿尔及利亚独立原则的建议。而且，对于法国来说，想依赖美国来维持殖民统治的结果，只可能是完全被美国排挤出去。印度支那就是一个很明显的先例。对于这一点，保守派和社会共和党（他们代表着在北非有更大利益的殖民集团）无疑是比较敏感的。在“地中海公约”计划提出以后，这些政党已经大为不满。这次盖伊阿接受了美英两国的“斡旋”建议，他们更加感到不安，就决心把这个内阁推翻了。
    那末，保守派和社会共和党准备怎么干呢？长久以来，他们一直在酝酿和筹划组织一个军事独裁的“强有力”的政府，对北非执行比目前更为强硬的政策。最近法国的法西斯分子疯狂地进行挑衅活动，就和这种阴谋有着密切的关连。
    采取更蛮横的镇压政策，能改善法国在北非的处境吗？显然这只是殖民主义者的幻想而已。法国在阿尔及利亚进行了三年半的血腥镇压，战费日耗二十亿法郎之巨，兵员调遣八十万人之众，搞得国内民穷财竭，但是在阿尔及利亚战场上还是越来越狼狈。如果法国进一步扩大在北非的战争，就只会引起北非人民更大的反抗，而加速法国的失败。
    至于在法国建立军事独裁政府，也绝不是轻易可以办到的。有着光荣斗争传统的法国工人阶级和进步力量，在法国共产党的领导下，已经对法西斯挑衅进行了有力的反击。然而应该指出，法国国内的法西斯威胁，正是法国政府进行殖民战争的后果之一。因此，堵塞法西斯的道路和结束在阿尔及利亚的“肮脏战争”，这是摆在法国人民面前两个不可分割的斗争任务。要在这个斗争中取得胜利，唯一的道路就是法国共产党所一再指出的，左派力量必须加强团结，建立一个能够符合1956年大选中所反映的人民意志的民主政府。只有这样，法国才能找到一条正确的出路。
