The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region has been established for two years. Today, not only the people of Tibet feel extremely happy, but the people of all ethnic groups across the country are equally jubilant. The Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region was established on April 22, 1956, under the personal guidance and assistance of the central delegation headed by Vice Premier Chen Yi. This is another great victory for the great Communist Party and Chairman Mao's brilliant ethnic policy. This is a major step for the Tibetan people to realize regional autonomy, thereby creating extremely reliable conditions for further developing the political, economic, and cultural undertakings of the Tibetan people, and gradually moving towards a happy socialist road together with all fraternal ethnic groups in the country. Over the past two years, thanks to the correct leadership and cordial care of the Party Central Committee, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, the direct leadership of the CPC Tibet Working Committee and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, and the joint efforts of the People's Liberation Army in Tibet, all staff members, and all Tibetan monks and lay people, the unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities and within Tibet has been further developed and consolidated. The anti-imperialist patriotic enthusiasm of the Tibetan monks and lay people of all strata has also been continuously growing. The progress in political, economic, cultural, and other undertakings in the Tibet region is also very encouraging, and the achievements made are greater than at any time in the past.

After the establishment of the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region, the offices, departments, sections, and other institutions under the Preparatory Committee were successively established, and the Preparatory Committee of the Tibet Local Committee of the Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference was also established in November of the same year. This has brought the work in Tibet to a new stage and laid a reliable foundation for the Tibetan people to realize regional autonomy. In terms of religion, in order to implement the central government's policy of freedom of religious belief, protect Lama temples, and strengthen the unity between various religious sects, the Religious Affairs Committee and the mass organization of religious circles—the Tibet Branch of the Buddhist Association of China—were established. These have played a positive role in promoting Buddhism in the Tibet region. In terms of cadre training, in addition to running various cadre schools and training courses in various regions of Tibet to train cadres, a large number of young men and women were selected and sent to schools such as the Central Institute for Nationalities to study. The Tibet Public School and the Communist Youth League Tibet Cadre School were also specially established to train ethnic cadres of various professions. Many primary schools and one middle school have also been established, with a total of thousands of students. In terms of medical and health care, in addition to establishing medical and health institutions in various important towns, mobile medical services were also organized, which greatly benefited the masses in relieving their pain and enhancing their physical fitness. In terms of transportation, highways from Lhasa to Yadong, Lhasa to Shannan, and Ali to Xinjiang have been successively opened, and the highway from Heihe to Ali has also been put into trial operation. Air routes between Tibet and the capital Beijing have also been opened, thereby forming a transportation network in Tibet on land and in the air, making the political and economic ties between Tibet and the interior of the motherland closer. In terms of industrial construction, Tibet had no factories at all in the past. Now, hydropower plants, thermal power plants, automobile repair plants, serum plants, boron silicon plants, etc. have been built successively, and most of them have been put into production. In terms of agriculture and animal husbandry, in order to develop agriculture and animal husbandry in the Tibet region, the central government, in addition to issuing interest-free agricultural and animal husbandry loans and relief funds to various regions every year, has also issued a large number of agricultural tools and sent veterinary personnel to conduct mobile epidemic prevention and treatment, which has played a huge role in the development of agriculture and animal husbandry in Tibet. At the same time, in accordance with the central government's policy of "no democratic reforms for six years," we have begun to do things that are beneficial to the vast number of people in Tibet, such as exempting personnel and students participating in state organs from corvée taxes, and reducing and exempting the people from Ula corvée and debts. In short, in the past two years, we have made great achievements in various tasks in building Tibet, thereby gradually improving the material and cultural life of the Tibetan people and initially changing the poor and backward face of Tibet.

In the past, due to the imperialist aggression and enslavement and the exploitation and oppression of the reactionary ruling class, the Tibetan people suffered extremely painful wounds, which caused us to fall into poverty and backwardness. The iron facts of the past seven years since liberation have proved that if we want to get rid of poverty and backwardness and move towards prosperity and happiness, we must take the socialist road. Only in this way can we realize our common desire for prosperity and happiness. Therefore, we must continue to be under the correct leadership of the central government, Chairman Mao, and the State Council, and under the unified leadership of the CPC Tibet Working Committee and the Preparatory Committee for the Tibet Autonomous Region. We must work with the people of the whole country, arouse revolutionary vigor, strengthen the united front against imperialism and patriotism, consolidate the unity between the Han and Tibetan nationalities and within Tibet, and on the basis of the victory of the rectification movement and the anti-rightist struggle of the people of the whole country, we must carry out patriotic and socialist education to the end and resolutely oppose local nationalism. We must make a great leap forward in politics, ideology, work, and study, use all positive factors, create conditions for democratic reforms in the future, strive for reform in six years, and work hard for the early establishment of the Tibet Autonomous Region.

At present, we must also be vigilant at all times against the conspiracies of imperialist elements and separatist and regressive elements. They vainly attempt to rely on the help of imperialism to make Tibet return to the old road of imperialist enslavement and plunge the Tibetan people into the abyss of suffering. If these reactionary elements do not turn back in time, they will surely be spurned by the people and will be crushed by the revolutionary torrent.

We firmly believe that with the wise leadership of the great Communist Party and Chairman Mao, the unbreakable unity and mutual assistance of 600 million people, and the active and enthusiastic concrete assistance of the Han comrades working in Tibet, we will surely move from victory to victory in resolutely safeguarding the unification of the motherland, consolidating national defense, building our great socialist country of all fraternal ethnic groups, and in building the new Tibet of the motherland.

    积极创造条件争取六年后一定要改革
    西藏自治区筹委会第一副主任委员班禅额尔德尼的讲话
    西藏自治区筹备委员会成立已经二周年了，今天，不仅是西藏人民感到万分高兴，全国各族人民也同样欢欣鼓舞。西藏自治区筹备委员会是1956年4月22日在以陈毅副总理为首的中央代表团的亲临指示和帮助下成立的，这是伟大的共产党和毛主席光辉的民族政策又一巨大胜利，这是西藏人民实现区域自治的重大步骤，从而更进一步为发展西藏人民的政治、经济、文化等事业，逐步地同全国各兄弟民族一道走向幸福的社会主义道路，创造了极可靠的条件。二年来，由于党中央、毛主席和国务院的正确领导与亲切关怀，和中共西藏工委、西藏自治区筹委会的直接领导，以及进藏人民解放军和全体工作人员与全藏僧俗人民的共同努力，从而使汉、藏民族之间和西藏内部的团结，更加发展和巩固了，西藏各阶层僧俗人民反帝爱国热情也在不断增长，西藏地区的政治、经济、文化等事业的进展，也是令人十分振奋的，比以往任何时期取得的成绩都大。
    在西藏自治区筹委会成立后，相继成立了筹委会所属的厅、处、科等机构，和八个基巧级办又在同年11月间成立了中国人民政治协商会议西藏地方委员会筹备委员会，这样，就使西藏的工作到达了新的阶段，奠定了西藏人民实现区域自治的可靠基础。在宗教方面，为了贯彻中央的宗教信仰自由的政策，保护喇嘛寺庙，加强各教派之间的团结，又成立了宗教事务委员会和宗教界群众团体——中国佛教协会西藏分会，这些都为西藏地区宏扬佛教起到积极的作用。在培养干部方面，在西藏各地区除开办了各种干部学校和训练班培养干部外，并选派大批的男女青年到中央民族学院等学校学习，还特别举办了西藏公学和共青团西藏干部学校，来培养各种专业的民族干部。还建立了许多小学和一所中学，共有数千名学生。在医疗卫生方面，除了在各重要城镇设立医疗卫生机构外，还组织了巡回医疗，对解除群众疾病痛苦，增强人民体质，获得了很大好处。在交通运输方面，先后修通了拉萨到亚东、拉萨到山南、阿里到新疆等公路，黑河到阿里的公路也试线通车，并开辟了西藏与首都北京的航线，从而在西藏的陆空上形成了交通网，使西藏与祖国内地之间的政治、经济的联系更加密切了。在工业建设方面，西藏过去根本没有什么工厂，现在已先后修建了水电厂、火力发电厂、汽车修配厂、血清厂、硼矽厂等，绝大部分均已投入生产。在农牧业方面，中央为了发展西藏地区的农牧业，除了每年在各个地区发放无息农牧贷款和救济款外，并发给了大批的农具，派出了兽医人员巡回防疫治疗，这对西藏农牧业的发展，均起到了巨大的作用。同时，我们依据中央“六年不进行民主改革”的方针，开始进行对西藏广大人民有益的事情，如免去参加国家机关的工作人员、学员的人役税，减免了人民群众的乌拉差役和债务等。总之，两年来，我们在建设西藏的各项工作上，是获得了巨大成就，从而逐步使西藏人民的物质和文化生活有了改善，初步改变了西藏贫困和落后的面貌。
    西藏人民过去由于帝国主义的侵略奴役和反动统治阶级的剥削压榨，给我们藏族人民带来了极其沉痛的创伤，致使我们陷于贫困和落后的境地。解放七年来，铁的事实证明，我们要摆脱贫困和落后，走向繁荣和幸福，就必须走社会主义道路。这样，才能使我们实现繁荣幸福的共同愿望，因此，我们必须继续在中央、毛主席和国务院的正确领导下，在中共西藏工委和西藏自治区筹委会的统一领导下，我们要和全国人民一道，鼓起革命干劲，加强反帝爱国统一战线工作，巩固汉、藏之间和西藏内部的团结，在全国人民整风运动和反右派的胜利基础上，要将爱国主义和社会主义教育进行到底，坚决反对地方民族主义。我们要在政治上、思想上、工作上和学习上来个大跃进，运用一切积极因素，给今后民主改革创造条件，争取六年后一定要改革，为早日成立西藏自治区而努力。
    目前，我们还要时刻警惕帝国主义分子和分离倒退分子的阴谋活动，它们妄图依靠帝国主义的帮助，使西藏重走帝国主义奴役的老路，陷西藏人民于痛苦的深渊，这些反动分子如不及早回头，必定会遭到人民的唾弃，会被革命洪流击碎。
    我们深信，有伟大的共产党、毛主席的英明领导，有六亿人民牢不可破的团结和互助，有在藏汉族工作同志积极热情的具体帮助，我们在坚决维护祖国统一、巩固国防、建设我们各兄弟民族的伟大的社会主义国家，和在建设祖国新西藏的事业上，一定会从胜利走向胜利。
