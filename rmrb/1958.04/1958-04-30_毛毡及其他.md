    Felt and Other Items
    The scraps of leather left over from leather production in leather factories (livestock heads, hooves, etc.) used to be thrown away as "garbage." Now, in Xuzhou, they can be turned into many valuable things.
    They have a leather scrap production team that takes these scraps, meticulously cuts off the hair piece by piece, and after processing, it becomes the raw material for making felt. Each 100 jin of leather scraps can yield 15 to 20 jin of hair, which can be used to make felt or felt vests and felt hats for keeping warm, which sell well in Northeast and North China.
    The leather scraps after the hair is cut off can also be used to boil oil, which can then be used to make soap, candles, and industrial oil.

    毛毡及其他
    皮革厂制皮革多下来的碎皮（牲畜的头部、蹄子等），过去都是当“垃圾”扔了，现在在徐州市，却能制出许多宝贵的东西。
    他们有一个皮渣生产小组，把这种碎皮渣拿去，把上面的毛一点一点剪下来，经过加工以后就是制毛毡的毛料，每一百斤碎皮渣可以剪十五斤到二十斤毛，用这种毛料可以制成毛毡或御寒用的毛毡背心、毛毡帽，畅销我国东北、华北带。
    剪过毛以后的碎皮，还可以熬油，然后可以制成肥皂、腊烛、工业用油。
