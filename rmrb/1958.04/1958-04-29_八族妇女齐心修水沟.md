Women of Eight Ethnic Groups Work Together to Repair the Ditch

In Gao Wu Ka Township, Yuanyang County, Honghe Hani and Yi Autonomous Prefecture, Yunnan Province, there is a ditch called "Women's Ditch," which was built by women of eight ethnic groups, including Yi, Miao, and Han, living in Gao Wu Ka Township.

The story of this "Women's Ditch" is quite something. Originally, there was a small river called Qidipo, about forty miles away from Gao Wu Ka Township, with a constant flow of water throughout the year. In the past, some people wanted to bring the water from this river to Gao Wu Ka Township to irrigate the fields, but because of the distance and lack of manpower, they never succeeded. This year, the women of all ethnic groups in Gao Wu Ka Township decided to bring the water from this river to Gao Wu Ka Township. Hu Dama, a Hani female committee member, led several strong young women, carrying blankets and dry food, to climb the mountain to observe the terrain and delve into the grass more than a meter deep to survey the ditch route. After repeated surveys, they found a relatively straight route. In their work, they didn't have measuring tapes, so they used kudzu vines connected together as a substitute; they didn't have spirit levels, so they used empty wine bottles filled with water placed on wooden boards to observe. In this way, the women overcame one difficulty after another. After twenty-five days and nights of continuous labor, they finally dug a ditch more than forty miles long, bringing the water from the Qidipo River to Gao Wu Ka Township. This ditch can irrigate more than 5,000 mu of paddy fields. In order to commemorate the hard work of the women, people specifically named this ditch "Women's Ditch."

    八族妇女齐心修水沟
    在云南省红河哈尼族彝族自治州元阳县高吾卡乡，有一条名叫“妇女沟”的水沟，它是居住在高吾卡乡的彝、苗、汉、傣等八个民族的妇女修成的。
    提起这条“妇女沟”来也不简单。原来在离高吾卡乡约四十多里路的地方，有一条七底坡小河，终年流水不断。过去就有人想把这条小河的水引进高吾卡乡浇田，但是因为路远，力量也不够，始终没有办到。今年，高吾卡乡的各族妇女决定把这条河的水引进高吾卡乡。哈尼族妇女委员胡大妈带领着几个年轻力壮的姑娘，背着毯子，带上干粮爬到山上去观察地势，钻进一人多深的草丛中去勘察沟路。经过三番五次的勘测，才找出一条较直的路线。他们在工作中没有皮尺，就用葛藤接起来代替，没有水平仪，就用空酒瓶装上水放在木板上来观察。就这样，一个个的困难都被妇女们克服了。经过二十五天夜以继日的劳动，终于挖通了一条四十多里长的水沟，把七底坡河的水引到了高吾卡乡。这条沟水可灌溉五千多亩稻田。为了纪念妇女们的辛勤劳动，人们特意把这条沟叫作“妇女沟”。
