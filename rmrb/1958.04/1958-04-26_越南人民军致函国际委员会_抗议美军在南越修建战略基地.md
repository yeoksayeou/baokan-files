Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 25th. Ho Van Lau, head of the Liaison Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army, pointed out in his recent letter to the International Commission that the Saigon-Bien Hoa Highway, currently under construction in South Vietnam, which is 30 kilometers long and 2 kilometers wide, is in fact a large-scale, modern strategic base of the United States in Indochina and Southeast Asia, and it can be used as an airport for jet aircraft.

Ho Van Lau pointed out that the construction of this strategic base not only threatens the Vietnamese people, but also threatens the security of Southeast Asian countries. He demanded that the International Commission conduct a comprehensive investigation into this matter and urge the South Vietnamese authorities to immediately stop the construction of this project.

Xinhua News Agency, Hanoi, April 25th. The Liaison Delegation of the Vietnam People's Army has recently written a series of letters to the International Commission, exposing a series of inhumane crimes committed by the South Vietnamese authorities in persecuting former resistance personnel, and requesting the International Commission to investigate and deal with them in accordance with Article 14, Paragraph C of the Geneva Accords.

The letter cited the case of Huang Shi Men (female), a former resistance fighter from Phong Thai village, Phong Dien district, Thua Thien province, who was imprisoned in Thua Thien prison and subjected to persecution. The letter stated that the South Vietnamese authorities drove long nails into Huang Shi Men's heels, then hung her up and beat her chest with large sticks until she vomited blood.

These letters also listed examples of the brutal persecution of four former resistance personnel in Tinh Tho commune, Son Tinh district, Quang Ngai province, and other former resistance personnel.

    抗议美军在南越修建战略基地
    据新华社河内25日电　越南人民军联络代表团团长何文楼在他最近写给国际委员会的信中指出，目前在南越修建的长三十公里、宽两公里的西贡一边和公路，实际上是美国在印度支那和东南亚地区的大型现代化的战略基地，它可以当作喷气飞机的机场使用。
    何文楼指出，这个战略基地的修建，不但威胁到越南人民，也威胁到东南亚各国的安全。他要求国际委员会就这件事进行全面调查，并且促使南越当局立即停止修建这项工程。
    联络代表团最近还在写给国际委员会的另一些信件中，抗议美国继续明目张胆地把大量武器运进南越和南越军队不断非法侵入非军事区的事件。
    据新华社河内25日电　越南人民军联络代表团最近连续写信给国际委员会，揭发南越当局迫害前抗战人员的一系列惨无人道的罪行，并且要求国际委员会根据日内瓦协议第十四条丙款进行调查处理。
    信中举例叙述了被关在承天监牢里的承天省风田县风泰乡的前抗战人员黄氏门（女）遭到迫害的情况，信中说，南越当局把长钉钉进黄氏门的脚跟，然后把她吊起来，用大棍打她的胸部，一直打到吐血。
    这些信件还列举了广义省山静县静寿乡的四名前抗战人员和其他一些前抗战人员遭到残酷迫害的事例。
