    我们需要这样的首创精神
    番禺县办起农业大学
    本报讯　南方日报消息：广东省番禺县决定兴办农业大学——番禺农学院，并于本月7日开始招收先修班学生。
    番禺农学院暂设农业、畜牧两系，每系开两班，每班三十人。另外，为了适应农业机械化的需要，附设农业机械训练班，招收学员三十人。为了保证教学质量，先办先修班，争取于本月20日前开课，帮助具有高二文化程度以上的学生以四个半月的时间学完高三的主要课程，即政治、语文、数学、化学、生物等，到今年8月，经考试合格再正式开始学习农业大学的课程。初中毕业或相当于初中毕业文化程度的学生，则以一年半的时间，帮助他们修完高中的主要课程，即政治、语文、数学、物理、化学、动植物学等，到明年秋季，经过考试合格再正式升上大学。为了贯彻教育的阶级路线，优先录取工农青年、农业社的“土农艺师”和参加了工农业生产的高初中生。
    番禺农学院在政治上、行政上是由该县负责；在教务上是由华南农学院负责，是华南农学院的“卫星”学院。农学院贯彻勤俭办学、勤工俭学的方针，参加学习的学生要一边读书、一边劳动生产。
