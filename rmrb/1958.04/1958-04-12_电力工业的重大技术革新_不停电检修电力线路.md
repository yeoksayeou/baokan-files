A Major Technological Innovation in the Power Industry –
    Live-Line Maintenance of Power Lines
    (Our newspaper, Anshan, 11th) A new method for live-line maintenance of power lines has been successfully tested in Anshan. This is a major technological reform in China's power industry. The planned promotion of this new maintenance method on power lines throughout China is of great significance for ensuring an uninterrupted supply of electricity to industry and cities.
    The maintenance and repair of power lines is an indispensable and regular task for power industry departments to ensure a safe power supply, and is an important link in ensuring safe power supply. In the past, in order to ensure the safety of maintenance workers, power industry departments stipulated that all types of lines must be repaired under conditions of power outage. During power outage maintenance, workers used their bare hands to directly contact de-energized wires, replacing poles or loading and unloading various components on the poles. In recent years, with the development of industrial production and construction in China, power industry departments have erected many power lines in various places, and the number of line maintenance projects and the workload have also been continuously increasing. When a power outage is required to repair a line project, several or even dozens of factories and mines are often forced to stop production. In the event of serious line failures, power must also be cut off for emergency handling. Thus, the following situation often arises: in order to ensure that the state produces more products, industrial production factories and mines require power industry departments not to cut off power or to cut off power less frequently, while power industry departments have to cut off power to repair lines in order to ensure a safe power supply. This long-standing contradiction may be gradually resolved with the advent of the new method of live-line maintenance. The new maintenance method mainly uses various insulated tools to replace human hands. Maintenance workers manipulate various insulated tools to move the live wires架架on the poles or towers away from their original positions in different directions, keeping them at a distance that prevents electric shock. Then, the maintenance workers use insulated tools to perform maintenance work such as replacing insulators, replacing poles, and replacing cross-arms. Since the worker's operating position is outside the distance where electric shock is possible, and at the same time, the maintenance work is carried out with the help of a sufficiently safe platform and insulated tools, a large amount of electricity can still be supplied to users through the wires as usual when the power lines are being repaired, and the maintenance workers will not be in danger of electric shock.
    The successful testing of this new method of live-line maintenance of power lines has broken the conventional practice of power outage maintenance in China's power industry for many years. The new method of repairing lines has been tested in practice by the Anshan Power Supply Bureau for nearly two years, and has proven that it can be applied to lines of various voltages (including ultra-high voltage). The efficiency of repairing lines using live-line maintenance is much higher than that of power outage maintenance. Power outage maintenance requires a large number of people to be concentrated to carry out a blitz repair within a very short period of power outage, and the work-hour utilization rate is very low. Live-line maintenance can evenly arrange manpower and is not limited by power outage time. Therefore, there is no need to carry out a blitz repair, and the work can be done according to plan. The task of past power outage maintenance can be completed with half the manpower. Even if live-line maintenance is required in the shortest possible time, insulated tools can be used to complete the task completely.
    (Our newspaper, Anshan, 11th) The new method of live-line maintenance of power transmission lines has aroused great attention from power industry departments across the country. Not long ago, power departments from Taiyuan, Guangzhou, Nanjing, Kunming, Jilin, Changchun, Shenyang, Lushun-Dalian, Fushun and other places sent more than one hundred engineers, technicians and veteran maintenance workers to watch the actual operation performance of live-line maintenance performed by the bureau near Anshan. Recently, the Anshan Power Supply Bureau has been constantly receiving letters from power departments across the country, requesting them to introduce the experience of live-line maintenance, and some departments have also requested the bureau to help manufacture various insulated tools.

### 电力工业的重大技术革新——不停电检修电力线路

    电力工业的重大技术革新——
    不停电检修电力线路
    本报鞍山11日电　不停电检修电力线路的新方法已经在鞍山试验成功。这是我国电力工业中一项重大的技术改革。这种新的检修方法在我国各地电力线路上的有计划推行，对于保证不间断地供应工业和城市用电，有着重大的意义。
    电力线路的维护检修，是电力工业部门为保证安全供电所不可缺少的一项经常性的工作，是保证安全供电的一个重要环节。过去，电力工业部门为了保证检修工人的安全，规定在检修各种线路时，必须在停止送电的情况下进行。在停电检修时，工人们用双手直接同没有电的导线接触，换杆或装卸线杆上的各种部件。几年来，随着我国工业生产建设的发展，电力工业部门在各地架设了许多电力线路，线路检修的项目和工作量，也不断增多增大，在停电检修一个线路工程时，往往迫使几个甚至几十个厂矿停止生产。在线路上发生了严重的故障时，也需停电作紧急处理。这样，就经常造成如下的情况：工业生产厂矿为保证多给国家生产各种产品，要求电力工业部门不停电或少停电，而电力工业部门为了保证安全供电，又不得不停电检修线路。这个长期以来不能解决的矛盾，随着新的不停电检修的方法的出现，就可能逐步地得到解决。新的检修方法，主要是用各种绝缘工具来代替人的双手。检修工人操纵着各种绝缘工具，把架在电杆或铁塔上的带电导线，按照不同的方向挪离原有的位置，使它同检修工人保持着不能触电的距离，然后，检修工人就使用绝缘工具，进行换瓷瓶、换线杆、换横担等检修工作。由于工人的操作位置是在可能触电的距离之外，同时又是借助于足够安全的操作台、绝缘工具进行检修工作，因此，在电力线路进行检修时，大量的电力仍然可以通过导线照常供应用户，检修工人也不会发生触电的危险。
    不停电检修电力线路这一新方法的试验成功，打破了我国电力工业多年来停电检修的常规。新的检修线路的方法，经过鞍山供电局近两年来的实地试验，已经证明可以在各种电压（包括超高压）的线路上应用。采用不停电检修方法检修线路，比停电检修的效率高出很多。停电检修线路，要集中大批人力，在停电很短的时间内进行突击性的检修，工时利用率很低。带电检修线路，可以均衡安排力量，不受停电时间的限制，因此不必进行突击性的抢修，可按照计划工作，在少用一半人力的情况下，完成过去停电检修的任务，即使要求在最短时间带电检修线路，利用绝缘工具也完全可以完成任务。
    本报鞍山11日电　不停电检修送电线路的新方法，已经引起国内各地电力工业部门的极大重视。不久前，太原、广州、南京、昆明、吉林、长春、沈阳、旅大、抚顺等地的电业部门，派来了一百多个工程技术人员和老检修工人，在鞍山附近观看了这个局所作的不停电检修的实际操作表演。最近，鞍山供电局不断接到各地电业部门的来信，要求他们介绍不停电检修的经验，有些部门还要求这个局帮助制造各种绝缘工具。
