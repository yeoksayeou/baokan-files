    美国衰退症流行资本主义世界
    拉丁美洲经济普遍恶化
    新华社12日讯　据塔斯社纽约11日讯：纽约出版的“曼哈顿大通银行”的公报，列举了一些材料，证明1957年拉丁美洲国家经济状况恶化。
    公报说，去年玻利维亚的锡（它的主要产品）、钨、银、铅、锌、铜的开采和输出都减少了。输往美国的有色金属1957年比1956年减少了59％。阿根廷的工业生产去年继续下降。阿根廷中央银行的黄金储备一年中减少了七千万到八千万美元。对美国的贸易逆差达到了一亿九千五百四十万美元。一年内生活费用上涨了23％。
    去年巴西的黄金和外汇储备减少了23％，国内通货继续膨胀。1957年的输出比1956年减少了5％。在这段时期内对美国的输出从七亿四千四百万美元减少到六亿八千六百万美元，而从美国的输入却增加了60％。一年内巴西咖啡的输出减少了两百五十万袋。国际收支赤字达一亿二千九百万美元。
    公报指出，哥伦比亚1957年咖啡的输出比1956年少5％，哥伦比亚总输出额一年内减少了6％。从1956年12月到1957年12月，中央银行的黄金美元储备减少了21％。
    去年秘鲁的贸易逆差比1956年增加51％。中央银行的黄金和美元储备，从1956年底的四千一百七十万美元减少到去年12月的一千零五十万美元，而今年1月又减少到四百九十万美元。1957年的生活费用上涨了8％。
    拉丁美洲国家总的输出1957年比1956年大约减少了1％，而输入却增加了14％。在这一段时间内，从美国的输入增加了20％以上，而对美国的输出只增加4％。这一切使得拉丁美洲国家的贸易逆差上升了。
    公报在谈到美国的经济衰退对拉丁美洲国家经济的影响时指出，这种衰退主要的影响表现为拉丁美洲国家输往美国的有色金属价格下跌、数量减少。
