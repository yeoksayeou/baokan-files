Talking About "Masses' Emotions"
　　Wu Lü

In various movements, people pay close attention to studying "masses' emotions." The level of the masses' emotions is often taken as a barometer to measure the development of the movement.

Indeed, this barometer is very accurate, and it is extremely important to grasp it. Emotion is a reflection of thought. Without the masses' conscious awareness in their thinking, there will be no active actions by the masses, and no movement is possible. However, if one only stands in front of this barometer and becomes complacent when the masses' emotions are high, it is a worrying tendency. Good things turning into bad things often starts here. Therefore, experienced leaders always pay special attention to maintaining a calm mind when the masses' emotions are high.

At the beginning of this year, after the general rectification of Zhengzhou State-owned Cotton Mill No. 2 came to a close, the masses' emotions were very high, and production improved significantly. The Party committee decided to use this opportunity to concentrate its efforts over a relatively long period to work on the issue of transferring cadres to lower levels. This plan seemed good. However, contrary to expectations, the masses' high emotions not only did not allow the leaders to shift their energy to other areas, but instead raised a large number of new issues, demanding that the leaders resolve them. The Party committee was in constant uproar. Some came to inquire about whether or not to leap forward; some came to ask for instructions on how to leap forward; some submitted letters of determination; and some even carried production victory reports to the door. It was impossible to stay in the office any longer. The Party committee held another meeting to analyze the situation, believing that the masses' emotions were very high and that it was necessary to cherish the masses' enthusiasm and stand up to lead the masses to leap forward, otherwise it would be a waste of the masses' enthusiasm, and therefore revised the work plan.

This matter may not be new, and many enterprises have probably had the same experience. But the idea that the masses' enthusiasm must be cherished and not wasted is worth pondering deeply.

What does it mean to cherish the masses' enthusiasm? It means to specifically lead the masses. In the previous period, on the ideological basis of rectification and under the encouragement of the Great Leap Forward in agriculture, the workers' emotions were very high, and they all demanded a leap forward. At this time, cherishing the masses' enthusiasm meant requiring the leading cadres of enterprises to specifically lead the masses in formulating leap forward plans. Now, the plans are mostly in place, and these plans have inspired the masses' emotions even more. At this time, the most important thing to do to cherish the masses' enthusiasm is to grasp measures in order to realize the leap forward plans as soon as possible. If this point is not grasped, I am afraid that the masses' enthusiasm may be wasted.

After formulating a production leap forward plan, Wuhan Jiu'an Pharmaceutical Factory immediately took measures to turn the plan on paper into leap forward actions, which is the greatest way to cherish the masses' enthusiasm, because it guarantees that the masses' enthusiasm can blossom and bear fruit as soon as possible. A few days ago, the Liberation Daily also published a news item reporting on the leap forward of Shanghai Keyi Hardware Factory. This factory's production task this year is four times higher than last year, and the workers' emotions are very high. They automatically proposed a guarantee: not to ask for sick leave and to continue to participate in production as usual. If the leading cadres of this factory saw that the masses' enthusiasm was very high and went to sleep, the masses' enthusiasm would likely be wasted. Although the spirit of not asking for sick leave is good, it is ultimately difficult to sustain, and the result is inevitably a case of "penny wise, pound foolish". But the leading cadres of Keyi Hardware Factory did not sleep. On the one hand, they persuaded the workers to ensure attendance based on their actual health conditions, and on the other hand, they mobilized the masses to start improving production efficiency by improving technology. Now, they have found some measures to replace some manual operations with simple machinery. If this continues, the masses' enthusiasm will certainly not be wasted, and "one point of heat" can also emit "two points of light".

Now, the "masses' emotions" barometer is still rising. However, whether it is "one point of heat" emitting "half a point of light", "only heat" and "no light", or "one point of heat" emitting "two points of light" depends on whether the leadership only stands in front of the "masses' emotions" barometer nodding and praising, or whether they seriously grasp measures like Wuhan Jiu'an Pharmaceutical Factory and Shanghai Keyi Hardware Factory and organize the masses to work diligently.

### 谈“群众情绪”

    谈“群众情绪”
    吴滤
    在各种各样的运动中，人们都很注意研究“群众情绪”。常常把群众情绪的高低，当作测量运动发展情况的寒暑表。
    确实，这支寒暑表是很灵验的，掌握这支寒暑表也是十分重要的。情绪是思想的反映，离开了群众思想上的自觉，就没有群众的积极行动，也就不可能有任何运动。但是，如果只是站在这支寒暑表前，见群众情绪高涨就踌躇满志，却是一种令人担忧的倾向。好事变坏事，常常由这里开始。因而，有经验的领导者，总是特别注意在群众情绪高涨的时候，保持冷静的头脑。
    今年年初，郑州国棉二厂一般整改告一段落之后，群众情绪很高，生产很有起色，党委会决定利用这个时机，集中力量以一个较长的时期来做下放干部的工作。看来，这个打算并不坏。然而，事与愿违，群众情绪高涨，非但不容领导把精力转移到别的方面去，反而提出一大堆新的问题来要求领导解决。党委会里天天人声沸腾。有来打听跃不跃进的；有来请示怎样跃进的；有递决心书的；还有把生产捷报抬上门来的。屋子里再也呆不下去了。党委会又开会分析形势，认为群众情绪很高，必须爱护群众的热情，站出来领导群众跃进，否则就会浪费群众的热情，因而重新修改了工作部署。
    这事或许并不新鲜，恐怕很多企业都有过同样的经历。但群众的热情须加爱护，勿使造成浪费，却是很值得深思的提法。
    什么叫爱护群众的热情呢？就是去具体领导群众。前一个时期，在整风的思想基础上，在农业大跃进的鼓舞下，工人的情绪很高，纷纷要求跃进。这时候，爱护群众的热情，就是要求企业的领导干部去具体领导群众制订跃进规划。现在，规划大都有了，这些规划把群众的情绪鼓舞得更高了。这时候，爱护群众的热情，最主要的是抓措施，以便尽快地实现跃进规划。若不抓这一条，怕还可能浪费群众的热情。
    武汉久安制药厂在订出生产跃进规划以后，立即采取措施，把纸上的规划变成跃进的行动，就是对群众热情的最大的爱护，因为它保证了群众的热情能尽快地开花结果。前几天，解放日报也登过一条消息，报道上海科仪五金厂的跃进。这个厂今年的生产任务比去年增加四倍，工人情绪很高，他们自动提出保证：生病不请假，照常参加生产。要是这个厂的领导干部看见群众热情很高就去睡大觉的话，群众的热情是很可能被浪费掉的。生病不请假，精神虽好，但终难持久，结果难免得不偿失。但科仪五金厂的领导干部没有睡大觉，他们一方面说服工人要根据实际健康情况保证出勤，一方面发动群众从改进技术着手来提高生产效率。如今，他们已经找到一些措施，可以用简单的机械来代替部分手工操作了。照这样下去，群众的热情固然不会浪费，而且“一分热”还能发“两分光”。
    现在，看“群众情绪”这支寒暑表，还是直升不降的。但是，是“一分热”发“半分光”，是“只有热”“不发光”，还是“一分热”发“两分光”，就看领导是仅仅站在“群众情绪”的寒暑表前点头称赞呢，还是像武汉久安制药厂、上海科仪五金厂那样认真抓措施，组织群众踏踏实实地干起来。
