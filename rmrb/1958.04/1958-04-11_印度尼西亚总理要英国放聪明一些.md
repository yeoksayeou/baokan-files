Xinhua News Agency, Jakarta, April 8th: According to a report by Antara News Agency, Indonesian Prime Minister Djuanda told a Jakarta-based reporter from the London "News Chronicle" on the 7th that he hoped Britain would be more astute than the United States in handling its relations with Indonesia.

Djuanda pointed out that the illegal activities in Singapore are the main obstacle to British-Indonesian relations.

Djuanda said that it is difficult to determine how much London has done to restrict anti-Indonesian activities in Singapore, but Britain can certainly do some concrete things to show goodwill.
