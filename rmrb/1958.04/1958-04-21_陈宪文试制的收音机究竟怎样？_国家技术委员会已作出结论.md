What is the status of the radio trial-produced by Chen Xianwen?
The State Technology Commission has reached a conclusion

On January 24th, this newspaper published the news that Chen Xianwen, a lecturer at the Beijing Railway Institute, had successfully trial-produced a new type of radio, which aroused the attention of a large number of radio enthusiasts. We received nearly ten thousand letters from readers all over the country asking about the specific situation of this radio. Now, after review and appraisal by the State Technology Commission, a conclusion has been reached that this radio is actually a common crystal radio using three coupled circuits for crystal detection. Although this crystal radio does not have any new creations in circuit design, the components used (such as antenna, ground wire, coils, crystal, and speaker) are designed to reduce current loss. Because the electrical parameters are relatively reasonable, it can make full use of the received high-frequency electrical energy. Using a 25-watt reflective high-efficiency loudspeaker, the output volume is increased.

Chen Xianwen's research in this area has indeed achieved certain results, which has promoted the production of high-efficiency crystal radios. However, since this radio is made using various existing materials and accessories, some components are expensive. It is still necessary to continue to study how to select various parts (especially high-efficiency loudspeakers) with good quality, high efficiency, low price, and suitable for crystal radios. Whether this problem can be solved is the key to whether this radio can be mass-produced and promoted. Now, Beijing Railway Institute has assigned someone to assist Chen Xianwen to continue his research, so that a high-quality, low-cost crystal radio can be manufactured in the future.

### 陈宪文试制的收音机究竟怎样？  国家技术委员会已作出结论

    陈宪文试制的收音机究竟怎样？
    国家技术委员会已作出结论
    1月24日本报发表了北京铁道学院讲师陈宪文试制成功新式收音机的消息后，引起广大无线电爱好者的注意，先后收到近万封来自全国各地的读者来信，询问这种收音机的具体情况。现在经过国家技术委员会的审查和鉴定，已作出结论，认为这种收音机实际是一般三个耦合回路用矿石检波的矿石收音机。这种矿石收音机虽然在线路设计上没有新的创造，但是所采用的原件（如天地线、线圈、矿石和喇叭等）都设法减少电流损耗，因为电气参数比较合理，能充分利用所接受的高频电能，利用二十五瓦反射式高效率扬声器，因此输出音量就增大了。
    陈宪文在这方面的研究，是确实取得了一定的成绩，对于高效率矿石收音机的生产起了促进作用。但是，由于这个收音机是利用各种现有材料和配件制成的，有的原件价格高贵，还必须继续研究怎样选择质量好、效率高、价格便宜、适合矿石收音机所用的各种零件（特别是高效率喇叭），这个问题能否解决，是这种收音机能否大量生产推广使用的关键。现在北京铁道学院已指定专人协助陈宪文继续研究，使将来能制成质量好、成本低的矿石收音机。
