    "Burned Red..."
    Qi Xiang
    The teachers of Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications discussed and appreciated a student's big-character poster with great satisfaction, because the big-character poster used the title "Burned Red Professor ×××." It is said that some teachers changed their past incorrect views on big-character posters and students giving opinions to teachers because of the title of this big-character poster.
    Why is it that this big-character poster with the title "Burned Red..." makes the teachers so satisfied? I think it is precisely because this title correctly embodies the spirit of the "Double-Anti" movement, and illustrates the positive significance of students criticizing teachers (or teachers criticizing each other) and helping teachers transform their thinking.
    First of all, "burned red" means that the purpose of burning is to make "red," not for anything else. Most of the teachers in universities have specialized knowledge, and even those who are not very "specialized" are very actively striving to be "specialized." The problem is that they are not "red" enough, and there are various degrees of bourgeois ideology in teaching and scientific research. Students posting big-character posters about teachers is precisely to burn away this bourgeois ideology from the teachers. It is necessary to burn the teachers who were not "red" to make them "red," and to burn the teachers who were already somewhat "red" to make them even "redder." Even if students are sometimes limited by their level and the angle of observation and cannot always meet this requirement, this is the original role and purpose of the big-character poster. Not only should students burn teachers to "burn them red," but teachers themselves should also set fire to themselves for this purpose.
    Secondly, "burned red" also means that it must be burned to a certain degree, and burned thoroughly, not superficially. Experience has proved that the deeply rooted bourgeois ideology of bourgeois intellectuals from the old society cannot be thoroughly transformed without being burned red and thoroughly by a raging fire. "Steel is made through a hundred refinements." Only when the red-hot molten iron flows out can it be cast. Now, universities and scientific research institutions have entered the climax of the "Double-Anti" movement, and the raging fire is burning. There are also a few corners where, although they have to burn a small fire under the general situation, it is not strong or prosperous, and it does not harm the feathers they have always cherished, and it cannot reach the degree of burning red at all, so it is impossible to have much effect on transforming thinking. Therefore, burning must be burning red.
    Thirdly, "burned red" also means not "burned to a crisp" or "burned to death." The purpose of criticism is to be kind and to cure diseases and save people. Internal contradictions among the people must never be killed with one blow. Burning away the bourgeois ideology of a teacher is only to help him better and faster transform himself, and it is by no means to burn him to a crisp or burn him to death. If criticizing a person means beating him so that he cannot stand up, this is definitely not the correct attitude of criticism. Therefore, all abuse, intimidation, and malicious slander are undesirable. Students' big-character posters may be too sharp in their wording, and the criticism is inevitably inaccurate, but the general spirit is to help teachers transform themselves. Teachers who understand this spirit should not be negative, disappointed, or lose confidence because they have been criticized by big-character posters. Of course, if someone is too fragile and cannot withstand burning, and is burned to a crisp or burned to death immediately, that is his own problem. Criticism and big-character posters were originally only intended to burn red, not to burn to a crisp or burn to death.
    The title of this big-character poster, "Burned Red...", which has a very correct meaning, not only explains the purpose of the movement, but also explains the practice of the movement. No wonder the teachers are very satisfied and have developed a good impression of big-character posters through this title.
    I sincerely hope that the big-character posters of all universities will do their best to "burn red" the teachers, and I sincerely hope that the teachers of all universities will recognize the meaning of "burned red" and earnestly burn themselves red in the movement.

    “烧红了……”
    齐祥
    北京邮电学院的教师们以十分满意的心情谈论和欣赏一张学生的大字报，为的是这张大字报用了一个“烧红了×××教授”的标题。据说，有些教师就是因为这张大字报的标题改变了过去对大字报、对学生给教师提意见的不正确的看法。
    为什么这个用了“烧红了……”作标题的大字报会使得教师们这样满意呢？我以为正因为这个标题正确地体现了“双反”运动的精神，说明了学生批评教师（或者教师相互间的批评）、帮助教师改造思想的积极意义。
    首先，“烧红了”就是意味着烧的目的是为了“红”，而不是为了别的。高等学校的教师们绝大部分是学有专长的，即使不十分“专”的教师，也都十分积极地向“专”的方向努力，问题在于“红”得不够，在教学中、在科学研究中存在着各色各样的不同程度的资产阶级思想。学生贴教师的大字报，正是要烧掉教师身上的这种资产阶级思想。要把本来不“红”的教师烧“红”，把本来已经有些“红”的教师烧得更“红”。即使学生有时限于水平、限于观察的角度不一定都能达到这个要求，但大字报的作用和目的本来就是这样。不仅学生烧教师是为了“烧红”，教师们自己引火烧身也应该为了这个目的。
    其次，“烧红了”还意味着要烧到一定程度，要烧得透，不能不痛不痒。经验证明，从旧社会来的资产阶级知识分子的根深蒂固的资产阶级思想，不经过一次熊熊烈火把它烧红烧透，是不可能得到彻底改造的。“百炼成钢”，当通红的铁水流出时，才能进行铸造。现在，各高等学校和各科学研究机构，都已进入“双反”运动高潮，烈火正在烧。也有少数角落，虽然在总的形势下不能不烧点小火，但不旺不盛，无伤于素所珍惜的毛羽，根本不能达到烧红的程度，因而也就不可能对改造思想起多大作用。因此，烧就必须烧红。
    第三，“烧红了”还意味着不是“烧焦了”或“烧死了”。批评的目的是与人为善，是治病救人，对待人民内部矛盾决不能一棍子打死。烧掉一个教师身上的资产阶级思想，只是为了帮助他更好更快地改造自己，决不是要将他烧焦烧死。如果批评一个人就要将他打得不能站起来，这决不是正确的批评态度。因此，一切谩骂、恫吓、恶意诋毁都是不应有的。学生的大字报言词可能过于尖锐，批评也难免失实，但总的精神是在帮助教师改造。教师们体会这种精神，也不应该因受到大字报的批评而消极、失望、丧失信心。当然，如果有人太脆弱，太经不起烧，一下就烧焦烧死了，那是他本人的问题了。批评、出大字报本来只是为了烧红，并无烧焦烧死之意的。
    “烧红了……”这个含义十分正确的大字报的标题，既说明了运动的目的，也说明了运动的做法，无怪乎教师们十分满意而且通过这个标题引起了对大字报的好感了。
    我衷心地希望各高等学校的大字报都尽到“烧红了”教师的作用，更衷心地希望各高等学校的教师们认识到“烧红了”的意义，认真地在运动中烧红自己。
